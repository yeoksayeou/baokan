<h3>怎樣產除黑市</h3>
<p>三月中旬，全國商業統制總會的成立，及物資移動取締條例的頒布，一般人期待着因物資統制的合珊，而澈底調整物價問題；最近因爲糧食移動的寬弛，白米黑市，已經回小到十分之六，這個『民以食爲天』的「食」的問題好轉，一般人似乎舒了一口氣。</p>
<p>我們會經說過，也可以說大多數人都同樣說過，糧食問題，爲物價問題的中心，一般物價的漲落，常隨糧價爲轉移。可是，目前的事實，並不能證實這一論斷，因爲糧價已在下跌了，而別的物價並不隨之下跌。</p>
<p>今天想就怎樣剷除黑市，貢獻一些意見。</p>
<p>管制物價的實施時，必須注意三個原則：一是全面與統一，二是經濟與政治並重，三是「檢舉」「監察」「執行」合一，而尤須出之以「決心」。大凡事情的成敗，其關鍵完全繫於「決心」，我們相信惟有在決心的利刃下，萬事才能迎刃而解，得到成功。譬如對於當局評定的物價，表面不敢違抗，而暗中另有黑市價格，這種黑市的存在，就是全盤管制物價的最大障礙，我們並不能爲此喪氣，應該想方法去克服。所以要實施管制物價，接着就要準備應付黑市問題的決心，如此始能表裏如一，斬草除根。怎樣剷除黑市，應注意下列各點：</p>
<p>（一）不要操切　現在物價平均已經增至事變前的數十倍。目前對於限價的希望，只要能够使它不致無軌道的暴漲，已算是成功了，至於比事變前究竟還高出若干倍，則不必去回溯關心。我們要認定凡經當局斟酌的考慮結果的限價標準，是非常切實可行的，必須有這種實事求是的態度，而後才可以無形中滅除滋生黑市的毒菌。政府當局在限價的前夕，旣示人以志在必行的最大決心，在限價的開始，復持寬厚體諒的誠意，使大家一方面不致在突然的波動中受到虧折，一方面在商業情緒上都能平穩的漸漸習慣這新的環境，但大家對於限價，在事實上和情緒上旣已由此有了準備，以後當局即應嚴格維持市塲的平穩，絕對不能容許再有暴漲和暗漲的惡象發生。</p>
<p>（二）理解商情　主持限價的人員，雖爲政府官吏，或以政府官吏爲主體，但他們所做的工作，却是屬於商務性質的。如果不把商塲內慕研究淸楚，以便對於變化莫測的商情，獲得充分的理解，則所爲之限價措施，必然有如隔靴搔癢，不但不能限價，也許在悖謬措施之下，反而刺激物價的上漲。理解商情，不但可使限價的種種措施切合情理，避免刺激物價的反作用，而且還可以因爲對於商情的理解，明白市塲上某個時候的臨時困難，儘可能的予以協助，不致由於這種困難而產生物價的暴漲，譬如甲地某種物品不能全部自給，向來仰給乙地，忽因特殊事故，或運輸中輟，甲地某種物品受此影響，價格自易暴漲，主持限價者如能洞悉商情，必可成竹在胸，一方面了解臨時缺貨的眞况，斟酌聽令爲某種限度的漲價，一方面由政府儘可能予以便利，協助正當商人向其他出產代用品的地方收購運境，平衡其缺乏的程度。如此酌情入理，竭忠盡智去實施限價，價始可眞正得平，否則限價者一方面盲人瞎馬去限，一方而以嚴刑峻法去嚇，前者不能體諒商人困難，後者使商人不敢明目違抗，結果就只有走於黑市一途了。</p>
<p>（三）限制逾購　收購目前市塲物品，雖然若干種已經實施配給，若干種規定限購量，可是，只要有「錢」有「力」，不免仍有逾量收購的事實，於是就構成囤積居奇的一大因素，因爲這種方式太過巧妙方便了，所以必須想出有效的嚴禁方法，使有錢有力者，也不能逾量收購。此着不加嚴禁，則有力的投機者隨時可能根據當局評定的限價，逾量收購，待市塲該貨緊縮，遂暗中定下黑市價格，高價拋出，轉手獲利十百倍。所以限制逾量收購，即所以打擊黑市投機。</p>
<p>以上所述三點，不過是採用釜底抽薪的辦法，僅能避免刺激黑市的生長，工於心計的投機家們，還可以技巧地透過視綫，圖逞私慾。所以，更必須積極的輔以嚴禁黑市的明令，偵騎四出，滿佈黑市之偵察網，使投機者的一舉一動，無所遁形，一經發覺黑市交易，商人果然嚴懲不貸，達官犯法尤與庶人同罪，就是購買黑市貨的，也同樣須予處罰。如能這樣嚴切執行，我們相信黑市可以剷除，限價可以成功。</p>

<h3>日蘇漁業暫定協定　簽訂始末</h3>
<p>締結日蘇漁業暫定協定的交涉，自去年末以來，日蘇二國間在庫比希夫進行磋商，茲已圓滿結束，於二十四日二國的國內手續均告終了，乃於二十五日午後六時（日本時間二十六日午前零時）在該地由日本駐蘇大使佐藤及蘇聯外交人民委員會代理委員長羅索夫斯基正式簽署。去年三月二十日所簽訂的該條約暫定協定，至去年十二月二十一日滿期。日蘇二國政府在該約滿期之前，在七二月初旬，即已進行交涉，將一九二八年簽訂的日蘇漁業基本條約再延長一年，至本年年底爲止。締結暫定協定，茲告成立。日本政府對於本問題的眞意，希望將日蘇漁業基本條約加以改訂，並愈早締結愈妙，現所締結的暫定協定，僅將目前的局面拖延敷衍，甚爲不滿。但無論如何因此次第八次暫定協定的成立，在本年中，日本的北洋漁業權益，可以圓滿行使，鑒於目前的國際情勢，也可以說是差强人意的幸事。而英美等敵國屢加謀劃的日蘇離間的煽動，對於業已締結中立條約之兩國友好關係，茲由事實證明其無所作爲。根據樸資茅斯條約中所規定之日蘇條約，確認日本的漁業權益，始有日蘇漁業基本條約的締結，日本政府茲督促蘇聯當局繼續該條約的改訂交涉。關於該事件，政府接到住藤大使簽署完竣之公報，即由情報局公佈如次</p>
<p>（情報局發表）二十六日午前十時，「日蘇締結漁業條約交涉，去年亦曾進行，惟至年底尙未交涉成功，乃自十二月以來，磋商締結暫定協定，俾將現行漁業條約有效期間延長至本年年底，茲巳交涉成功，乃於三月二十五日，在庫比希夫由日駐蘇大使佐藤與蘇聯外交人民委員會代表委昌長羅索夫斯基簽訂暫定協定。」</p>
<p>由於過去日俄戰役的結果，日本與帝俄之問規定了，日本在北洋的漁業權益，並在樸資茅斯條約中加以確認。根據該條約而規定日本權益之行使的第一次漁業條約，締結於明洽四十年初，期限爲十二年。因中途發生革命，而依國帝政崩潰，日本政府乃與新成立的蘇維埃社會主義聯邦共和國政府，在大正十四年一月，締結基本條約，予以確認。之後，進行締結改訂條約，交涉的結果，於昭和三年一月二十三日，由當時的日本駐蘇田中大使，與蘇聯外交人民委員長長加拉罕，簽訂了期限八年的條約，其間關於內容的更改，由廣田與加拉罕協定加以決定。現行條約實即是該條約滿期後逐年延長其有效期間以至於今日。</p>
<p>昭和三年一月簽訂之日蘇漁業基本條約，至昭和十一年五月末滿期。兩國政府在此之先，進行締結改訂條約的交涉，迄未妥協，爲避免無條約的狀態，乃於該年五月二十五日締結第一次暫定協定，至該年末日爲止，一面並繼續進行改訂交涉，結果至十二月已獲得雙方同意的成案。然而蘇聯政府誤解當時日德間成立的防共協定的眞意，拒絕簽訂，故功虧一簧。結果，至該年十二月二十八日，締結以昭和十二年末日爲期的第二次暫定協定，當時日本政府，極感遺憾。</p>
<p>之後，日本政府根據正當的對蘇權益，督促蘇聯政府締結改訂條約，但蘇聯政府一味拖延敷衍，因此，遂有第三次（昭和十二年十二月二十九日）第四次（昭和十四年四月二日）第五次（同年十二月三十一日）第六次（昭和十六年一月二十日）第七次（昭和十七年三月二十日）逐年締結延長其效力的暫定協定，雖是一時的糊塗策，然終究也避免了無條約的惡事態。當然上述措置，立脚於正當權益的日本政府斷不引以爲滿足。萬一在無條約的狀態中，日本因行使權益而惹起日蘇間最惡劣的事態，殊非冀求世界和平的日本政府的本意。爲全世界人類的福利計，不惜隱忍自重，甘於上述的措置。如此，第七次協定原於去年末日滿期，同時，根據「由目下交涉中於一九四二年中即可締結的新條約以替代」的規定在第七次協定締結後，日本政府繼續督促蘇聯政府進行改訂交涉之議，迄十一月末尙未交涉成功，不得已乃自該年十二月以來開始磋商第八次暫定協定，在本年度漁期開始之前，佐藤與羅索夫斯基在二十三日的會談中意見已趨一致，乃於二十五日卒告成立。</p>
<p>由此，日本在本年度權益的行使，雖可以順利推進，然日本政府締結改訂條約的誠意，乃根據樸資茅斯條約及日蘇基本條約所規定之正當權利而主張者，蘇聯政府在本年亦應遵從國際信誼，並鑒於中立條約的精神，拋棄一切猜忌懸慮，開誠佈告，適應日本的要求，迅即成立改訂條約，使兩國關係因此更趨明朗化，且由此可排擊英美等制霸世界的野心，而有所貢獻於民族共榮的新世界建設。（翔：譯自三月二十七日東京讀賣報知）</p>
<p>朝日新聞社評</p>
<p>蘇領漁業，是日本北洋漁業的基礎，由日本先人所開拓者，當過去日俄戰役時，費了日本國民貴重的血液，始換得了這不滅的漁業權，並在日蘇基本條約中重加確認，茲無需在此再加贅述。</p>
<p>根據這漁業權而規範其運營者，有日蘇漁業協定，此次成立的第八次漁業暫定協定，不用說是極應當的事。當目前風雲緊急的國際環境中，尤其是英美陣營不斷傳播日蘇危機的流言，傾所有手段以策動日蘇的離間的時候，該協定的成立，實有很重大的意義，日蘇關係因兩國間的中立條約而屹然確立。谷外相在正月的議會中亦曾聲明日本尊重中立條約，不變對蘇外交的方針。這方針自以蘇聯同樣遵守中立條約爲前提條件。此次漁業協定圓滿成立的事實，也正完全顯示了蘇聯政府遵守中立條約的精神。正常的日蘇關係之保持，茲又重獲明證。</p>
<p>如欲指出不滿之點，則此次成立的漁業協定，僅爲以本年度一年爲期的暫定協定，而且這暫定協定已重訂至八次之多。這每年一度重訂的協定，實不勝其煩。希望協定中所明示的長期日蘇漁業條約，從速締結，庶日蘇中立關係得建立於確實性與恒久性之基礎上。</p>
<p>於此，本年度的暫定協定曾差堪告慰於一時，但我們重又强調在本年度應實現年來所希望的長期日蘇漁業基本條約早日締結。（翔：譯自三月二十七日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>關於商業統制實施之商榷（二）</h3>
<p>— 高懋動</p>
<p>（二）建立各業統馭的永久盤存制度　普通上級機關對其下級機關，常籟法令規章，以行使其監督管轄之權。在統制制度，此項監督權，固亦有其重要之功用，但不能達到統制物資收付之功能。欲求達到此目的，必須設計一種方法，使能直接管轄下級機關之帳册，此法維何，即建立統馭的永久盤存制度是已。此種會計制度建立後，則各業之盤存，可於統制總會帳面上，隨時求得之。此固可採用成本會計所使用之方法，但同時更須兼採政府會計之精神，使用種種備忘記載，使會計上之記載，與公事上之支配，完全脗合。如此辦法，則所謂通盤籌劃，方有確切數字之依據，按現行登記辦法，對於各業存貨之登記，已採用收付餘額之記錄，似與不佞所主張之上述會計制度，若相符合。惟就現在調查存貨情形觀之，類皆詢問多於查核，可知現行辦法，似尚未確立統馭的永久盤存制度，以致調查人員，不能根據統制總會統馭帳之餘額，出與各業存貨分淸帳互相核對，故查察成效，大爲低减。鄙意商統總會，宜提高會計職權，特設會計處，建立商業統制下各業統馭的永久盤存制度，然後一冊在手，而全國各業之物資了然在目，無復有敢朦混者矣。</p>
<p>（三）實行管理倉庫　囤積爲統制之阻礙，而倉庫則爲囤積之工具，商人利用倉庫，藉棧單之移轉爲投機之買賣，從而破壞統制，故欲行統制，必須杜絕囤積，欲杜囤積，必須實行管理倉庫。按現行登記辦法，亦即管理存貨之方法，但究無實行管理倉庫之嚴密與切實，蓋現代經濟社會，惟價格足以控制一切，而管理倉庫，即所以控制價格，能控制價格，即能統制經濟。譬如中央銀行，惟其有最充　之資金，然後能高下利息而控制金融，其理正復相同也。</p>
<h3>幣制兌換單位之更改</h3>
<p>北京一日中央社電　據中國聯合準備銀行三十一日發表，華中華南方面軍票自四月一日廢止發行後，對於往返於華北及華中華南之旅客，所携帶之貨幣兌換辦法，決定廢止。以往以聯銀券與軍票間兌換單位之制度，改爲以聯銀券至中儲券爲兌換單位，旅客一人持票一枚，車票船票搭乘飛機票，均可者，可兌換聯銀券一百八十圓，儲備券一千元，兌換率爲聯銀券十八圓對中儲券一百元。</p>
<h3>評言　金融業當扶助小工業</h3>
<p>昨論金融業與生產事業，茲論金融業扶助小工業的重要。我國一般的小工業和手工業，或以資力不足，或以辦理欠善，均覺範圍狹小，未克充分發展；這種工業，在我幽佔絕大多數，而其對經濟社會的效用和其重要性，實不可加以輕視。據二十四年社會局調查，上海市（租界除外）商店之兼有手工業性質者，有二六·一二八家，純粹手工業工廠有五•八七四家。到了現在，雖無完備的統計，大致總是有增無减。散於各地的，如紡織，竹木，陶磁，等類，產量也很可觀。在今日物資缺乏的時候，這種小工業和手工業的提倡，實有不容稍緩之勢。</p>
<p>金融業正應在這裏找一個正當的出路，就是促使小範圍的工業，逐漸繁榮起來。金融業扶助這種工業的方法，第一爲資金的補助，如購料貸款，生產貸款，運銷貸款等。第二爲技術的援助，如廠址的尋覓，設備的配置，製造方法的改進，產銷方針的籌劃，及有關技術的其他一切問題。銀行和這種小工業發生關係較多後，若遇性質相似的，即易於促進他們相互間的合作，使生產效力，日趨宏大，則今日爲實業的萌芽，他日便當蔚然成林，爲我國實業界放一異彩，莫非導源於今日金融業的扶助。</p>

<h3>扶桑笈影溯當年</h3>
<p>— 周佛海</p>
<p>一個靑年，要有理想，有抱負，有野心。否則，便沒有靈魂。有了理想，抱負，和野心，而父要刻苦，鍛鍊，和努力。否則，便是在妄。不是我自負，我在靑年時代，是有靈魂的，同時，也決不狂妄。我幼時的抱負和苦學的情形，在「苦學記」中已經寫過了。不過那篇文章，只寫到渡日留學，考進東京的第一高，畢校時爲止。現在把那個時候以後，留學期內的生活情形，以及暑假回國，從事社會運動的經過，略述一個大槪。</p>
<p>那個時候，我國政府，指定了五個日本國立的學校，凡是考進這五個學校中之一的，都給官費。五個學校，就是第一高等（畢業後入帝大），高等師　，高等工業，高等商業，和千葉藥專。五個學校之中，最出鋒頭，最爲當時的女學生所個慕的，是一高的學生，戴一頂兩道白圈的制帽，披一件披風，脚下却穿一雙「下馱」（木屣），在街上大搖大擺，昂首高歌，略略做一些出軌的事，不但警察都不去管，社會人士，還認爲可愛。我當時一心一意，想進一高，而一高又非常難考，見着一高的中國留學生，非常羨慕。現在我居然考中了，兩道白邊的帽子，也飛到我頭上來了。這不單是有了官費，經濟問題可以解決，同時，我的理想也實現了。所以當時快樂的情形，遠超過老童生進學。發榜後，立即向湖南留日學生經理處預支了一個月學費（那時每月是三十六圓），到房州去避暑，去海水浴。</p>
<p>開學以後，我就用起苦功來了。早上六點半鐘起，晚上十一點鐘睡，每日的十六七個鐘頭之中，休息的時間至多不過二小時。因爲要學的東西太多了，學校的功課，已經忙得不亦樂乎，單只外國語一科，有英文，有德文，有日本的古文。但是這些東西，決不能滿足我的求知慾，課外的工作，比課內的史多。第一，讀中國古書。第二，當時社會主義和民主主義的思潮，非常澎湃，尤其是恢國和德國革命，對於靑年予以不少的刺激，所以我對此很感興趣，這一類的書籍雜誌，努力去閱看。第三，我對於西洋歷史和當時的國際情形，也很有興趣，因爲那時正是第一次歐戰結束，國際聯盟成立的時候，所以閱讀這一類的雜誌和書籍，也佔了我不少的時間。大約早晨起來，到學校之前，讀中國書，有時讀得起勁，竟高聲期誦起來，不管隔壁的日本同學，討厭不討厭。上課回來之後，閱讀課外書籍，然後吃晚飯。飯後到帝大門前一帶舊書店去翻閱舊書，借以散步，大約一小時。晚上讀到十一時以後，從「押入」（壁廚）內裏把鋪蓋拖出來，納頭便睡。星期日上午，還是用功，下午步行到神田的中國靑年會看看中國報，或訪訪同鄉。在一高預科的一年之中，每天都是這樣，不單是日本同學沒有交際，就是中國朋友，也少往來。不單是「芳原』（妓女區）「淺革」（遊樂區）沒有去過一回，就是影戲院也沒有去過一次，只是星期日晚上，中國靑年會演電影的時候，偶然去看看。每日唯一的娛樂，就是晚飯後跑舊書店。這個味道，印象很深，現在還常做這樣的夢。</p>
<p>因爲閱讀國際問國的書籍。也有多少心得，一時高興，做了一篇分析當時國際形勢並推測其趨勢的論文，投到留日回國學生在上海辦的「救國日報」，居然登了出來，而且博得好評。我中學時代的史地敎師鄧竹銘先生，遠道馳書獎勵，大爲稱讚。這便是我的處女作。</p>
<p>這樣的生活，過了一年。預科畢業，照例要分發了。當時日本只有八個高等學校。我因爲要選擇一個淸靜的地方，所以要求分發鹿兒島的第七高等學校。</p>
<p>兒鳥在日本的南端，風景秀麗，氣候溫和，人情樸　，是　鄕隆盛的故鄉，眞是一個很好的地方。那時七高，有十三四個中國學生。我任總司令部政　部主任時，爲我做了兩年多科長，我任江蘇敎育廳長時，　我做了五年多的秘書，後來我任官傳部長時，又爲我任秘書的陳天鷗，就是當時的同學，先我一年到鹿兒島。我離開了重慶之後，他現在還在任官傳部秘書。幫忙我十年的老友，現在還沉浮於宦海中，不能展其拘負，我心中委實抱歉，加以現在關山遠隔，魚雁難通，落月屋梁，那能令人不懷舊雨而感傷呢！</p>
<p>第一年除學校功課以外，專門只看社會主義的書籍，國際問題的書籍，沒有工夫再看了。讀書之外，作文譯書的興趣也大增加。這一年譯了「社會問題概觀」書，約六七萬字，賣給中華書局，得稿費一百二十元。這個款子，留作暑假回家省親的路費。當時梁比公一派的人，在上海辦有一解放與改造」半月刊，我常常投稿，都登載出來，稿費非常豐富。這種稿費，大部寄回家養母，一部拿來買書。</p>
<p>課外的娛樂，就是遊山玩水和看電影。海灣中的櫻島，是大正四年發火的火山。我去時山頂常常還冒烟，島上的批杷和蘿蔔，味道特別的好。我和幾個同學常於星期搖着小艇，渡海上島遊玩。每日下午，不是一個人騎脚踏車，沿着海岸到名叫磯濱的海岳去看海，就是登學校後面名叫城山的山頂去遠眺。看電影的朋友，就是陳天鷗。晚飯後，兩人談起電影，便不顧風雨，由我們住的叫做城谷的地方，步行到電影區天文館通。來回約有七八里，我們常常在大雨之夜，兩個人打一把雨傘，赤着脚穿一雙高跟「下馱」，跑去看電影。有時有好影戲，而錢却用完了，官費還沒有由東京寄來，兩人便只是乾着急，希望郵差光臨，但是郵差如來，而所送的是平信，仍舊失望，因爲滙款的信，都是掛號的。我有時開他的玩笑，由外面進去，大聲喊「書留！」（掛號信）他以　送滙款的郵差到了，出來一看，原來是我，有時等郵差不到，而周圍菜園上肥料，臭得心煩，於是大吟「前後有糞桶，往來無郵差」以自遺。</p>
<p>民國九年夏天，決心回沅陵省母。打一打算盤，除却往來川資外，所得稿費所餘無幾。想做一套西裝，算來算去沒有錢做，於是只好穿着學生裝回國。那曉得一到上海，便不能再往前進了。因爲那時張敬堯督湘，我們的湘軍，羣起驅張，戰事緊張，道路梗塞。這個情形，我在鹿兒島元全不知道，這次回家，完全爲省母，如今不能達到目的了。回想三年前離家出國之時，母親自己傷心，而又怕我傷心，，躱到廚房，背着我飲泣的情形，恨不得立即就跪在母親膝下，倒在母親懷中，去安慰他老人家。但是千里迢迢，除却望白雲而灑思親之淚之外，有甚麼辦法呢？寫到此地，遙想母親現在不知在甚麼地方，不知情形怎樣，眞趁痛不欲生！到了現在，還　三國時代的辦法來從事政治，實在沒有甚麼意義。</p>
<p>旣然不能回家，打算到杭州去玩玩。動身之前，去時事新報館訪張東蓀　他是一解放與改造」的主持人，我因爲投稿的關係，和他常常通信。我到了報館，他還沒有到。有個姓兪的編輯出來招呼，不久來了一人，大的是研究系的相當重要的人，隨梁任公遊歐回國的，姓名記小淸楚了，兪替我們介紹，他介紹我說這是周某人，是做文章的，他的介紹　在沒有錯，但我却萬分不高興。我當時抱負不凡，深以將來的大政治家或革命領袖自命，如今却被人叫做「做文章的」，把我看做一個單純的文人，因此感覺到是一種輕視。文人，自然有文人的價値和重要，但是我當時却志不在此。後來市蓀來了，却談得非常投機。他們常時組織「共學社」翻譯名著，請我也譯一本，我便担任翻譯克羅泡特余的「互助論」。</p>
<p>到西湖住在智果寺，每日除譯書，看書外，便和幾個朋友划船，登山，有時竟跳到湖中游泳。西湖附近的名勝，沒有不到過的。但是西湖夏天熱極了。夕陽西下後，湖水　熱氣反射出來，尤其覺得蒸熱。住了三個多星期，因爲熱不可耐，仍舊回到上海。</p>
<p>到了上海，張東蓀吿訴找，陳仲甫（獨秀）要見我。仲甫本是北大敎授，主辦「新靑年」鼓吹新思想，爲富時的當局所忌，所以棄職來滬，「新靑年」也移滬出版。有一天我和張東蓀，沈雁冰，去環龍路漁陽里（現在似已改爲銘德里）二號，去訪仲甫。當時有第三國際遠東代表俄人吳庭斯基在座。吳大意說：「中國現在關於新思想的潮流，雖然澎湃，但是第一太複雜，有無政府主義，有工團主義，有社會民主主義，有基爾特社會主義，五花八門，沒有一個主流，使思想界成爲混亂局勢。第二，沒有組識。做文章，說空話的人多，實際行動，一點都沒有。這樣決不能推動中國的革命。」他的結論，就是希望我們組織「中國共產黨」。當天討論，沒有結果，東蓀是不贊成的，所以以後的會議，他都沒有參加。我和雁冰是贊成的。經了幾决會商之後，便決定組織起來。南方由仲甫負責，北方由李守常（大釗）負責。當時所謂南陳北李。上海當時加入的有邵力子，沈玄廬等。戴季陶也是一個。不過他說，孫先生在世一日，他不能加入別黨，所以「中國共產黨綱」的最初草案，雖然是他起草的，他却沒有加入。這個時候，只是籌備組織，還沒有正式成立。預備在一年之中，於北京，漢口，長沙，廣州等地，先成立籌備性質的組織，然後於第二年夏天，開各地代表大會，正式成立。我在計劃擬定，分頭派人工作的時候，恰當學校要開學，所以就回到鹿兒島的學校去了。</p>
<p>我爲甚麼贊成組織共產黨，而且率先參加？第一，兩年來看到共產主義和俄國革命的書籍很多。對於共產主義的理想，不覺信仰起來；同時，對於中國當時軍閥官僚的政治，非常不滿，而又爲俄國革命所激刺，以爲非消滅道些支配階級，建設革命政府，不足以救中國。這是公的。第二，就是個人的動機。明人不做暗事，誠人不說假話，我決不隱瞞當時有個人的動機：我決不說假話，說當時的勸機，完全是爲國爲民。不過個人的動機，不是升官，不是發財，不是享樂。當時如此，以後如此，現在亦復如此。提起個人享樂，沒有這樣笨的人，做這樣笨的事。就是現在，也許有人以爲我們的和平運動，爲的是個人享受。其實寃枉萬分。據我個人現在的情形說，最愛的電影不能去看，最愛的舊劇，不能去聽，想去逛公園而不得，想去蕩馬路而不行。在家好像籠中的島，出外好比被押解的囚徒。每日生活，也不過日食三餐，　眠一榻，不能像以前軍閥官僚亂作胡爲，窮奢極慾。不單如此，連普通人能享的福，也不能享，普通人能做的事也不能做。這種情形，還是享福？還是受罪？當時雖然是個窮學生，不能預知現在的情形，但是確確實實志不在此。當時所謂個人的動機，就是政治的野心，就是PoliticalAmbition。在一高的時候，正是巴黎和會的前後，各國外交家　大出鋒顯。所以當時對於凡爾賽，非常神往，抱負着一種野心，將來想做一個折衝樽俎，馳騁於國際舞臺，爲國家爭光榮的大外交家。後來研究俄國革命史，又抱着一種野心，想做領導廣大民衆，推翻支配階級，樹立革命政權的革命領導者。列寗，特路茨基等人物的印象，時縈腦際，輾轉反側，夙興夜寐，都想成這樣的人物。雖然現在年將半百，一事無成，但是當時意氣之豪，實可以上衝雲霄！懷着這樣野心的靑年，又値着中國政治腐敗，世界革命怒潮高漲的時候，那得不本着創造的精神，去組織一個新興的革命黨，這便是我參加發起「中國共產黨」的原因。</p>
<p>回到鹿兒島之後，除掉上課以外，仍舊是研究馬克斯，列寗等著述，和發表論文。同時，我想要領導羣衆，除却論文，最要緊的是演說。所以糾合十幾個中國同學，組織了一個講演會。每禮拜講演一次，練習演說。當時同學都說我有演說天才，設話很能動人。我聽了這些獎勵，越加自命不凡，居然以中國的列寗自命。現在想起來，雖覺可笑，但是在靑年時代，是應該有這樣自命不凡的氣槪的。</p>
<p>我的了幾個朋友，租了一楝房子，自己弄伙食。每天有中國菜吃，生活比較在東京舒服。但是窮苦的地方，仍舊很多。一雙襪子不破底，決不去換。夏夜蚊子多，沒有錢買蚊帳，而又怕點蚊烟，只好拿了張報紙來蓋頭。蚊子雖然可避，報紙的油墨氣，實在雜聞！這一年譯完了一本「互助論」。</p>
<p>接着上海同志的信，知道七月間要開代表大會了。湊巧是暑假期中，我便回到上海。黨務發展得眞快，不單是我們去年計劃的上海，漢口，長沙，北京，廣州，都成了組織，就是濟南也有了支部。當時陳炯明在粵主政，還沒有叛變，的仲甫去粵，擔任廣東敎育委員會委員長。所以代表大會，他不能親來主持。廣東代表是公博，北京是張國燾，劉仁靜，長沙是毛澤東和一位姓何的老先生，漢。是陳潭秋，包惠僧，上海是李達，李漢俊，濟南是誰記不淸了。丁默村雖然不是代表，却是C.Y.（共產主義靑年團）的活動份子，也在上海。我便算是日本留學生的代表。其實鹿兒島方面」沒有一個人參加，東京只有一個施存統。我算是代表施和我自己兩人。第三國際，加派了馬令來做最高代表。我和毛澤東等三四人，住在貝勒路附近的博文女學樓上。當時學生放了暑假，所以我們租住。沒有床，我們都在樓板上打地舖。伙食，當然是吃包飯。在貝勒路李漢俊家，每晚開會。馬令和吳庭斯基也出席。開到第四晚時，究竟是馬令有經騐，他說：「明晚一定要換個地方。我們在此地一連開了幾晚會，一定使巡捕注意。」我們說反正明天只有一晚，一時又不易另我地方，大概不要緊。於是決定仍在原地。那天下午，我忽然肚子大痛大瀉，不能出門，一個人睡在地板上想工作進行的步驟，糊糊塗塗也就睡着了。大約十二時左右，忽然醒來，看見毛澤東探頭探腦進房來，輕輕的問我道：「這裏沒有發生問題嗎？」我駭了一驚，問他，纔知道是出了事。</p>
<p>原來他們正在開會的時候，忽然有一個面生的人跑進房來，因爲當時旣沒有衛兵守門，而漢俊家又是和同鄉合住。所以此人上樓，沒有人去阻止。他進房來一看，便道：「對不起，走錯了。」說完，立即退回。究竟是馬令機警，他說。「快散了罷，一定是偵探。」於是立即散會，只有公博還留着與漢俊閒談。不到一刻鐘，法國探目，安南巡捕，中國包打聽，把房子圍住，一湧上樓。探捕問他們爲甚麼開會，他們說大家都是北大學生，因爲要出一種雜誌和叢書，所以開會商議。探捕又問爲甚麼有兩個外國人。他們說兩人是北大敎授，請他們指導。一個中國探捕指着公博道：「你不是日本人嗎」？原來公博雖然自信他的北京話，說得和北京人一樣，而別人聽起來，却好像是外國人說中國話。所以硬指他是日本人。經了好久的說明，纔證明他是廣東人。巡捕有見漢俊書架上，全是社會主義的書，於是大敎訓一頓，說不應觀這些書。問了一刻，也就去了。僥倖巡捕沒有搜身。他們兩人衣袋內，都放有共產黨黨綱草案，如果搜出，這有不進巡捕房的道理！公博當時帶着新婚夫人度蜜月，住在大東旅社。巡捕走後，他怕有人跟稍，不敢逕回旅館，繞了幾個遊藝塲，纔回旅館。那知他緊隔壁的房中，當晚發生一件奸殺案，開了兩槍，打死了一個女人。公博夫人，眞嚇得魂不附體。毛澤東以爲博文女校，也一定被發現了，嚇得不敢回去。在遠遠的地方，探頭探腦偵察了半天，纔敢進去。這些話，都是我以後聽見他們說的。</p>
<p>我聽了毛澤東的報告以後，覺得功虧一簣，實在可惜，和他商量明日一定繼續開會，但是上海租界內恐怕不行了。我忽然想起李鶴鳴（建）的夫人是嘉興人，何不去嘉興開會。於是便力疾跑到漁陽果去商量，因爲鶴鳴是住在仲甫家裏的。我們商量決定，鶴鳴夫人明日早車赴嘉興，先雇一隻大船等着，我們第二班車去，乘船遊南湖。於是連夜分頭通知各人。到了第二大，三三兩兩的到北站上車，我也抱病前往。到了嘉興，早有鶴鳴夫人在站等候，奉我們上船。當地的人，以爲是遊南湖的，也小注意，我們把船開到湖中，忽然大雨滂沱。我們就在船上開起會來，通過黨綱和黨的組織，並選舉陳仲甫爲委員長，我爲副委員長，張國燾爲組織部長，李鶴鳴爲宣傳部長，伸甫未到滬的時期內，由我代理。「中國共產黨」，就這樣在煙雨蒼茫，湖波浩渺的孤舟中，正式產生了。當時我們對於這個黨，是懷着滿腔希望，而且舉全副精力去奮鬥的。那知道以後參加了惡劣的份子，越變越壞，竟變成殺人放火，屠城洗寨的流匪，和張獻忠，李自成一樣的殘忍。所以當時第一次全國代表的人物，大部都先後宜吿脫黨。公博向粵不久，就赴美留學，無形的退黨了。李漢俊，李鶴鳴和我，在十三年前後，都先後脫離了。劉仁靜被開除變爲托派了。我們當時的最高領袖陳仲甫（）秀），在十八九年的時候，也脫離了·張國燾在國民黨興勦共之師後，在那東還活躍了許久，但是二十六年也脫離了，現在在重慶，和陳立夫一起，做反共的工作。我以後二十六年秋，和仲甫在南京見面，二十七年春，在漢口和國燾見面，回憶前塵，都有隔世之感。我們發起共產黨的時候，做夢也沒有想釗會惡化到變成流匪。作俑的人，實在是罪孽深重！</p>
<p>大會完畢之後。一面指派各地的負責人，分頭前往工作，一面在上海活動起來。我們覺得實際工作，要從勞動運動做起。於是便成立了一個「勞動組合書記部」。以發動並指揮上海勞工運動。「勞動組合」是日本名詞。「書肥部」是俄國名詞的翻譯。把一個日本名詞和一個俄國名詞合併起來，做一個勞工運動組織的名詞，是費了許多心思纔想出來的，可見得當時的幼稚了。但是苦幹的精神，却可佩服。例如在日本人經營的紗廠的工人，想畢日本話。我便在工人羣居的地方，開一日語夜校。我自己每隔一夜去敎兩小時。「到民間去」的口號，我們都做到了。不僅這件事，當時的經費。是俄國供給的。我和馬令見面，不是在新世界，大世界，便是在永安公司的屋頂花園。在秘密工作正幹得起勁的時候，暑假快完了，我不能不回到學校去上課，所以迭電催促仲甫來滬，以便交代工作，再去鹿兒島。仲甫果然辭了廣東職務，到上海來了。誰知他到上海之後，突然發生了一件意外事件。</p>
<p>現在記不淸了，不知爲一件甚麼事，仲甫和馬令，雖然沒有見面，意見却不一致。仲甫是一條硬漢，一定要馬令認錯，纔肯見面。而馬令却不肯認錯。正在這樣相持的時候，有天我在仲甫家商量妥協方法，却被仲甫夫人拉着打牌。滑稽極了，仲甫夫人，楊明齋（俄國回來的山東人）和我三個人，打起麻將來了。仲甫和力子，在樓上談話。忽然包惠僧跑來說：「我剛從輔德里來，路上遇見密斯楊到你那裏去了。」原來我的秘密住處，在甫成都路輔德里，我那時正和淑慧戀愛着，是鳴夫人介紹的。聽了惠僧的話，我就把牌讓給他打，回到輔德里，淑慧正在等着，我便約她到法國公園去散步。經過漁陽里，她要去看仲甫夫人，被我阻止了。公園散步之後，我送她回家，順道去看馬令。他托我帶一封信給仲甫，竟把第三國際代表的頭銜拿出來，信中對仲甫說：「如果你是眞正的共產黨員，一定要聽第三國際的命令。」我帶着這封信再到漁陽里，已是黃昏時候了。敲開了後門，忽然一個山東大漠問道：「你找誰？」我說：「找陳先生。」他說：「不在家。」我立即覺得很奇怪，馬上退出。我想仲甫家寡沒有這樣的人，伺以這樣兇？回到輔德里不久，陳望道神色倉皇的走來說：「仲甫，力子，惠僧，明齋，和仲甫夫人，都被捉到巡捕房去了。你這裏一定很危險，趕快把重要文件燒掉，去躲避一下。」我問訊之後，非常驚異。後來聽見大家說起，纔知道原委。原來我走後半點鐘，巡捕來包圍，把一切人都捉去。惠僧做了我的替身，他不來報吿密斯楊的事，當然被捉的是我、決不是他。經過漁陽里時，如果聽淑慧的話，去看仲甫夫人，我和淑慧，也都要被捉。這兩關，我都逃過了。巧不巧呢？這還不算危險，還有危險的事。原來仲甫到了巡捕房，不承他自己是陳獨秀。巡捕房以爲沒有捉到陳獨秀，所以命令把守他的房子的包打探，不論是誰，凡到陳宅去的，都要捉去。湊巧褚輔成去訪仲甫，包打探不問靑紅皂白，把褚也捉去了褚到了巡捕房，上級人員是認得他的，問他何事到陳宅去，他當然說是訪陳，又問他是否認得陳獨秀，他說不認得怎麼去看他。捕房人員說帶他去看。於是帶他到拘留的地方。仲甫看見褚，正要打手勢叫他不要指出，而褚却先大聲喊道：「仲甫，這是怎樣一回事！」於是事情弄穿了。捕房遂通知把守陳宅的包打探說，陳獨秀已經捉到，以後來的人不要再捉了，我正是包打探接得通知之後，纔去送信的，吾則，一定也　　要被捉去。身上搜出第三國際代表的公文，眞賊實犯，還有不判幾年徒刑的嗎？這些話，也都是以後大家出來，對我說的。我逃脫這第三關，眞是大家之福。不然，一干人都要監禁幾年。力子和仲甫夫人，當晚就保釋了。但是營救仲甫却很費事。正在這個時候，又發生一件重要的事。</p>
<p>原來民國十年，美國召開華盛頓會議。第三國際，認爲這是宰割弱小民族的會議，所以在伊爾庫茨克召集了一個遠東弱小民族會議，以謀抵抗。中國方面，要召集工人，農民，商人和靑年的代表六七十人，派去出席。時間非常傷促，而又毫無準備，急得我毫無辦法。商量數次，以廣州爲中心的南方各大都市，和以北京爲中心的北方各都市，都派人去召集，長江一帶，由我親自出馬。於是把營救仲甫的事，托付力子等人，乘直航長沙的輪船逕赴長沙。</p>
<p>渡日的時候，由長沙到上海，所坐的船，不僅不是統艙，而且連四等艙都不如，是坐臥在運滬的米袋上的。這一次因爲掩護起見，坐了官艙。第一次吃飯的時候，五六個茶房，站在周園侍候盛飯，我坐着非常不安，因爲我　還是第一次經騐。我覺得同是一個人，爲甚麼我們可以坐着吃飯，他們却要立着伺候？但是過了兩三天，也就習慣了，不覺得甚麼不安。可見得一個人眞誠而純潔的靈魂，是容易墮落的。不過尊重人道的基本觀念，我還是非常濃厚的。跟隨我的副官們，不是做錯了事，我決不隨便責駡，對於其他的屬下，更不必說。但是偏有人說我是官僚，架子大。這眞是天大的寃枉。有許多人我不能接見，實在是沒有時間。我的時間，是要用在最有效的工作方面，那裏能够用去聽別人背履歷，發牢騷呢？時間實在不够支配，連星期日都要會客，辦事，敷衍不周到，自然是必有的事，那裏是架子大？也許我的環境使人看起我來好像是官僚，其實我的書生本色，始終絲毫沒有改變。誤會的事，實在很多。去年由日返國，經上海坐夜車到南京，天氣又冷又早，我萬想不到會有人在車站接我。下車一看，車前站着財政部和中儲的高級同事。我以爲只有少數人，所以點頭致謝外，就出了車站。以後有人吿訴我，當時去　的，還有社運會等機關的許多人，看我沒有和他們打招呼，事後駡我架子太大。其實我那裏知道有這許多人去接呢？這些事不必解釋，也不必求人諒解。不過寫到此地，不覺自然而然的順筆寫起出來。言歸正傳，離　出軌　話，不要　多說了、</p>
<p>到了長沙，住在當時有名的大吉祥旅館。連夜去看毛澤東。他那時在曾公祠辦了個自治大學。沒有敎授，也不上課，而名之爲大學，可見得五四運動後當時文化界之混亂了。他就住在校內。我進去後，遠遠看見他在燈下看書，原來是用紅筆圈李後主的詞。他看見我忽然到來，駭了一跳。我吿訴了原委，便連夜商量辦法。三天之內，召集了二十餘人。當然大部分是靑年學生，農民一個沒有，工人却有兩三個。我分別見面，指定了集合的日期和地點，並分發川資後，就離開了長沙。當時軍閥雖然沒有特務工作，也沒有藍衣社，但是却也有他的偵緝隊，不過不大靈敏罷了。我上船走了半天，趙恒愓纔派人到大吉祥去搜查。去年決心回家省母，而道路不通，今年到了長沙而不能回家，世界上的事，眞是不由人算！不單是不能回家，而且因爲秘密工作，速信也不好由長沙發，只好惘惘悵悵，離開長沙。</p>
<p>到了漢口，便去武昌尋陳潭秋，他在一個中學當敎員。和他商量，在兩日之內，的集了十餘人。閑時和他去遊黃鶴樓，望着長江景色，眞是「日暮鄕關何處是，烟波江上使人愁。」照例和各人分別談話後，於是隨流而下，到了安慶。這個地方，沒有熟人。在上海時，老早托高語罕介紹了兩個人，於是拿着信去尋。但是這兩人並非黨員，而安慶也沒有黨員，所以比較費事。他們的我遊菱湖公園和臨江寺，一面遊玩，一面說明，住了兩天，好不容易纔集了五六個人。於是又以安慶兩個新友的介紹，到蕪湖赭山的第五中學去訪一位學生。在此地也的了二三人。經過南京，並不勾留，一直回到上海。這次派赴伊爾庫茨克開會的靑年，以後大部都到莫斯科去留學。後來共產黨的新興幹部，一部就是這一批先生們，一部乃是法國回來的勤工儉學的學生。這兩部分人，在共產黨內，磨擦得很厲害，而其勢力，也互爲消長，這是後話</p>
<p>到了上海的時候，仲甫已經出獄，並和馬令見面了。學校早已開學，我便把經手的事，交給仲甫，偕淑慧渡洋，到鹿兒島去了。去年看報知道仲甫在四川江津逝世，回憶故人，悽愴欲絕。</p>
<p>我在上海和長江一帶活躍的情形，鹿兒島的中國同學，都不知道，而日本警察却知道了。到了鹿兒島後，他們暗中對我，非常監視。我的導師門脇先生也警吿我，要我注意，否則，有被開除學籍的可能。於是我便老老實實的用功，好在在鹿兒島也沒有活動的餘地</p>
<p>日本高等學校每年兩次的學期考試，是非常嚴格的。不軍是中國留學生留級的很多，日本的同學，留級的也不少。甚至有留兩三年的。一位山西同學，和我同住，每一年級，必留一次，人家只要三年，他却讀了六年。很佩服他有毅力，終於畢了業。我是很怕考試的。因爲平常課外的閱讀和譯作，佔了我許多時間，學校的功課，除却西洋史一類自己愛好的，和英文德文一類每日要繳卷的東西以外，平日是睬也不睬的，一定要到考前一兩週，纔臨時抱佛脚去連夜趕看。考試的關頭，眞不易通。就是現在，還常常做夢，夢見考期快到，而許多東西，還沒有看，心中着急，急醒過來，原來是夢。可見得考試給予我的印象的深刻了。但是僥倖我一次都沒有留級，很順利的畢業了第七高等學校。</p>
<p>鹿兒島實在可以留戀，櫻島朝霞，磯濱夕照，時常在我夢中。四年來，屢次經過福岡，飛往東京，總想到鹿兒島去重遊名勝，再訪母校，因爲時間的關係，終不可得。但是無論如伺一定要設法，以償宿願究竟進東京帝大或京都帝大，費了不少的考慮，當時有名的馬克斯主義的權威者河上肇先生任京大敎授，我因爲要進一步研究馬克斯主義，所以便入了京大。當我偕淑慧甫抵京都車站的時候，便服警察，就迎上前來，問我是否周某。因爲我從鹿兒島動身的時候，那裏的警察，早已電京都報吿了。我們便在學校後面的吉田町，租了牧田家的樓上兩間屋子住起來，自己開伙食。當時大學生的官費，是每月七十二圓。兩夫婦每月用七十二圓，自然拮据得很，所以不用下女，一切買菜，燒飯，洗衣，都由淑慧自任。有時官費沒有寄到，便把衣服或書籍，拿到當裏去當。起初去當，倒有些難爲情，以後也無所謂了。</p>
<p>當時先生，除却河上肇外，我最愛聽以後曾任商工大臣和鐵道大臣的小川鄉太郎的財政學。小川口如懸河，像個政治家。河上一副冷靜的面孔，嚴肅的聲調，眞可以領導人走上冷靜研究的道路。在大學時期，我每日是過的圖書館生活，連午飯都是帶乾糧去吃。只是晚飯後，或偕淑慧到附近田野間去散步，或一個人去跑舊書店。有了好電影，一定去看，但是都是一個人去。因爲一則由吉田町到電影區的京極，相當的遠，我來往都是步行。二則當然買的是最低的等級，常常沒有座位，要立着看。當時日本放映時間很長，一立就要立三四個鐘頭。有時站得太吃力，只好蹲着休息。我是電影迷，情願吃這樣的苦。淑慧自然不會這樣。所以大概是我一個人去。在京都也組織了一個演講會，每週練習講演。有决我的演題，　「資本是甚麼」？本着馬克斯中義的立塲，說明資本的本質，發主和發展，深得同學的好評。現在回想起來，當時情形，猶歷歷在目。</p>
<p>幼海是京都出世的，當時窮的要命，淑慧生產的時候，當然不能進醫院。生產的那天，恰好大雨，牧田老太太連夜於大雨中去接產婆，以後時常幫忙淑慧，撫養小孩。她這樣的熱心，我們非常感激。前年淑慧赴日，特地到京都託警察查了出來，前去拜訪。我由東京返國，經過京都時，也去看了她。事隔二十年，我們還特地去訪問，日本報紙對我們這樣的念舊情殷，都非常讚譽。</p>
<p>多了一個小孩子，事情就多得多。有時我正苦心焦思，研究一個理論的時候，小孩大聲啼哭，眞是心煩。淑慧除燒飯，洗衣外，又加上撫養小孩的事，生產之後，不到四天，就起來燒飯。可見得當時的艱苦了。有次我去上課，她去賀菜，把小孩一人放在房中，忽然房中蓆子，着起火來，剛好那時她回來，已經滿房都是烟，小孩悶得氣都閉塞了。如果她遲回去十分鐘，房子就會燒掉，小孩也要葬身火窟了。這也是很危險的一件事情。</p>
<p>沒有考進學校，非常憂慮；學校快畢業，却又非常恐慌。沒有進學校，不能領官費，飯都沒有吃，那夏能讀書？畢業離開學校，官費不能再領了；如果找不到職業，飯都沒有吃，那裏能革命？那怕你志氣比天還高，那怕你野心此海還大，不能生活，甚麼都是空的。志氣不能充飢，野心不能禦寒！咳！生活，生活，這兩個字，古往今來，不知埋沒了多少英雄豪傑，志士仁人！我當時有兩個打算；第一，最理想的是做北京大學的敎授。因爲五四運動，新文化運動以來，北大很出鋒頭·陳仲甫，李守常也都是那裏的敎授。做了北大敎授，地位旣可以號召，也有相當的虛榮。但是唯其如此，北大敎授，是不容易到手的。想的人旣多，而當時北大學閥的門，又關得相當的緊；那裏能够如願，第二，不得已而思其次，想到上海商務印書館當編輯。看見很多留日同學，在那裏任編輯。薪水最多的，每月是一百五十元。我想如果能得到月一百五十元，也可心滿意足了。但是談何容易！商務的編輯，雖然沒有北大敎授那樣困難，但是也不容易到手。到政府機關去運動一官半職，既然不是我的志願，也不是一個共產黨黨員所應爲。這件事情，雖然用盡心思，沒有辦法，但是卻從天外飛來意外的機會，很輕鬆把問題　解決了。</p>
<p>原來國共正式合作，國民黨開了第一次全國代表大會之後，許多共產黨都加入了國民黨。這就是所謂跨黨份子。我當時雖然還沒有正式加入國民黨，但是戴季陶先生，却約我去廣東幫忙。他當時任宣傳部長，要我任秘書，每月薪水大洋二百元。（當時廣東，都用毫洋。）後來到了賡州，鄒海濱（魯）又要我兼任廣東大學敎授。別的敎授，每月只有毫洋二百二十元，而對我却送大洋二百四十元。當時要求一個每月一百五十元的商務編輯都不可得，現在每月却有四百多元的收入。加之那時廣東，革命空氣，非常濃厚，革命工作，非常緊張，事事都表現前進向上的蓬勃氣象。所以我由學校一出來，就得了這樣的地位和工作環境，實在是始料所不及。但是這些都是後話，當在學校還沒有找得職業出路的時候，實在焦急萬狀。我想快要畢業的無數靑年，沒有一個不是這樣情形的。大家不要着急！「山窮水盡疑無路，柳暗花明又一村。只要預先播下了「努力」的種子，雖然一時覺得山窮水盡，終究會出現柳暗花明的境界的。</p>
<p>我不是道學先生，也不願意學道學先生。老實說，我秉性也不許我怎樣拘謹。回國以後，也曾有過不少的放誕行爲，浪漫事實，但是在留學的八年之中，却眞正過的是淸教徒的生活。不單是沒有一件足以稱爲「羅曼史」的豔遇，連狎遊也沒有嘗過一次。現在可以回憶的只有一件平淡無奇的事，我是愛吃酒的，量雖不大，興致却豪。在到鹿兒島的第一年，有一晚和同學痛飲，大醉而歸。不知道如何於歸途中倒臥在路傍。我當時住在城山後面一個僻靜地方，叫城谷，往來的人，非常之少。彷彿有位妙齡女郎，扶我起來，而且扶送我回家，我進了「玄關」（大門），馬上又倒在蓆上，只說一聲「謝謝」，也沒有看淸這位女郎的面貌，更沒有問她的姓名。次日酒醒，也就忘了。兩三日後，在赴學校的途中，遇見一個女學生，向我微笑，我以爲是偶然，也不注意。不久，又遇着，仍是微笑，並且好像要和我說話一樣。我以爲是認錯了人，但是覺得非常奇怪。第三次又遇着了。本來想問她一句，不過當時臉薄得很，和女人說話，臉就要紅。我們用了一個老太婆管家，她有一個十七八歲的女兒帶來同住，也生得相當秀麗，我和她說話的時候，眼睛總不敢對她看。就是現在和初次見面的女人說話，也覺得非常不自然。所以當時雖然要向那位小姐說話，眞是欲言而止者再。倒是她走近米先開口道：「那天晚上，你的酒，吃得眞太多了。」我恍　大悟，回想起那晚扶我的女郎。以後便常常遇見，因爲我們學校的對門，是一所高等女子學校。她到學校去上課，常常途中相遇。路上沒有人的時候，我們都常常談話，而且越談越親密。但是我却沒有問她的住址，當然沒有去拜訪她。如果進一步的追求，當然大有成爲眞正羅曼史的可能，但我却就此中止了。這便是我留日八年，唯一無二的够不上算豔遇的豔遇。</p>
<p>往事如烟，前塵似夢，一一追溯起來，倍覺光陰虛度，老大徒傷。二十年來，經歷了事業的艱雞，體騐了世途的險阻，當年的抱負，昔日的野心，好像過去的事實，如夢一般的消逝了一樣，也如烟一般消逝了。今後只希望盡自己一點微力，俾能對於國家和人民，略有涓埃的貢獻，以了此殘生，共他還有甚麼冀求呢？</p>

<h3>How to Eradicate the Black Market</h3>
<p>With the establishment of the National General Association for Commercial Control in mid-March, and the promulgation of the Regulations for the Prohibition of the Movement of Materials, the general public expected that the price issue would be thoroughly adjusted due to the consolidated management of materials. Recently, due to the relaxation of grain movement, the black market for rice has shrunk to six-tenths of its previous size. This improvement in the issue of "food," which is "what the people regard as their heaven," seems to have given the general public a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>We have said before, and most people have also said, that the grain issue is the center of the price issue, and the rise and fall of general prices often shift with grain prices. However, the current facts do not confirm this assertion, because grain prices have already fallen, but other prices have not fallen accordingly.</p>
<p>Today, I would like to offer some opinions on how to eradicate the black market.</p>
<p>When implementing price controls, three principles must be observed: First, comprehensiveness and unity; second, equal emphasis on economics and politics; and third, the unification of "reporting," "supervision," and "execution," and especially the exertion of "determination." The success or failure of anything depends entirely on "determination." We believe that only under the sharp blade of determination can all problems be solved easily and success be achieved. For example, for prices assessed by the authorities, people may not dare to disobey on the surface, but secretly there are black market prices. The existence of such a black market is the biggest obstacle to overall price control. We must not be discouraged by this, but should think of ways to overcome it. Therefore, to implement price controls, we must then prepare the determination to deal with the black market issue, so that we can be consistent in word and deed, and eradicate the root of the problem. To eradicate the black market, the following points should be noted:</p>
<p>(1) Do not be hasty. Currently, the average price has increased several dozen times compared to before the incident. The current hope for price limits is that they can prevent prices from soaring uncontrollably, which would be considered a success. As for how many times higher they are compared to before the incident, there is no need to look back and worry. We must recognize that the price limit standards, which have been carefully considered by the authorities, are very practical and feasible. Only with this pragmatic attitude can we eliminate the germs that breed the black market imperceptibly. On the eve of price limits, the government authorities showed their greatest determination to implement them without fail. At the beginning of price limits, they held a sincere intention of leniency and understanding, so that everyone would not suffer losses in sudden fluctuations on the one hand, and on the other hand, they could gradually get used to this new environment in a stable manner in terms of commercial sentiment. However, since everyone has made preparations for price limits in fact and in sentiment, the authorities should strictly maintain the stability of the market in the future, and absolutely must not allow the recurrence of the evil phenomena of soaring and secretly rising prices.</p>
<p>(2) Understand the commercial situation. Although the personnel in charge of price limits are government officials, or mainly government officials, the work they do is of a commercial nature. If they do not study the inside information of the commercial market clearly in order to gain a full understanding of the unpredictable commercial situation, then the price limit measures will inevitably be like scratching an itch from outside the boot. Not only will they fail to limit prices, but perhaps under absurd measures, they will instead stimulate price increases. Understanding the commercial situation can not only make the various price limit measures reasonable and avoid the adverse effects of stimulating prices, but also, because of the understanding of the commercial situation, understand the temporary difficulties in the market at a certain time, and provide assistance as much as possible, so as not to cause price surges due to these difficulties. For example, a certain commodity in place A cannot be fully self-sufficient and has always relied on place B. Suddenly, due to a special accident or the interruption of transportation, the price of a certain commodity in place A will easily surge under this influence. Those in charge of price limits, if they can understand the commercial situation, will surely have a clear idea in their minds. On the one hand, they will understand the true situation of the temporary shortage of goods and consider allowing a certain limit of price increase. On the other hand, the government will provide convenience as much as possible to assist legitimate merchants in purchasing and transporting goods from other places that produce substitutes, balancing the degree of shortage. If price limits are implemented in this way, with discretion and reason, and with loyalty and wisdom, prices can truly be leveled. Otherwise, the price limiters will blindly limit prices on the one hand, and scare people with severe penalties on the other. The former cannot understand the difficulties of merchants, and the latter makes merchants dare not openly resist. As a result, they can only take the path of the black market.</p>
<p>(3) Restrict over-purchasing. Although the purchase of current market goods has implemented rationing for some items and stipulated purchase limits for others, as long as there is "money" and "power," there is inevitably the fact of over-purchasing. This constitutes a major factor in hoarding and speculation, because this method is too clever and convenient, so an effective method of strict prohibition must be devised so that those with money and power cannot over-purchase. If this measure is not strictly prohibited, powerful speculators may at any time over-purchase based on the price limits assessed by the authorities, and when the market tightens on that commodity, they will secretly set black market prices and sell them at high prices, making profits of ten or hundreds of times. Therefore, restricting over-purchasing is striking at black market speculation.</p>
<p>The above three points are just a way to draw firewood from under the pot, which can only avoid stimulating the growth of the black market. Speculators who are skilled in scheming can also skillfully see through the line of sight and try to satisfy their selfish desires. Therefore, it is even more necessary to actively supplement with a clear order strictly prohibiting the black market, with scouts going out in all directions, and a reconnaissance network covering the black market, so that the speculators' every move is nowhere to hide. Once black market transactions are discovered, merchants should be severely punished without leniency, and high-ranking officials who violate the law should be punished the same as commoners. Those who purchase black market goods should also be punished in the same way.

If they cannot unite with each other, the future will be unimaginable. The first element of unity lies in the spirit. The key to spiritual unity lies in communicating culture.

<h3>Japanese Army Air Force in Burma Continues Bombing India, Shoots Down or Destroys 77 Enemy Aircraft, Anti-Axis Base in Oro Bay Also Bombed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 5:00 PM on the 1st that the Imperial Army Air Force is continuing to attack enemy air bases and military installations in eastern India. The battle situation from March 26th to 30th is as follows. Damage inflicted on the enemy: A. On the 26th, one enemy aircraft was shot down in Imphal, and large fires broke out at five military facilities in the area. At Cox's Bazar Island, one enemy 1,700-ton transport ship was sunk and four 500-ton ships were severely damaged. B. On the 27th, victories were achieved in Cox's Bazar and Imphal. C. On the 29th, six enemy aircraft were shot down in Cox's Bazar. D. On the 30th, twelve enemy aircraft were shot down and one was severely damaged east of Cox's Bazar and at the Ramu airfield, and military facilities were destroyed, with large fires breaking out at nine locations. At Alisongho, south of Maungdaw, two military facilities and supply depots were destroyed. Our side suffered no losses.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Army Air Force in Burma has recently bombed enemy bases in eastern India for ten consecutive days, including Feni airfield, airfields near Chittagong, Maes Khal Island north of Maungdaw and Cox's Bazar, Ramu airfield east of Cox's Bazar, and Alisongho south of Maungdaw. Seventy-seven enemy aircraft were shot down or destroyed, many enemy transport ships were sunk or damaged, and enemy military facilities such as docks were destroyed, resulting in great victories. During this period, except for seven Japanese aircraft that self-detonated or did not return on the 27th, all other aircraft safely returned to base. The newly discovered place names in this announcement of results, such as Ramu airfield and Alisongho, indicate that Japanese aircraft have heavily damaged enemy bases in eastern India. It appears that the British Indian Army's attempt to counterattack Burma is still active on the India-Burma border. However, due to the continuous and fierce bombing of enemy airfields and transport ships by the Japanese Air Force, the British Indian Army in eastern India is now in a state of panic. Also, regarding the results of the Japanese aircraft's attack on Feni and Chittagong enemy airfields on the 27th, the Japanese General Headquarters in Chittagong has announced that nine enemy aircraft caught fire after being hit, and there were also as many as eleven that were confirmed to be on fire. A total of two enemy aircraft on the ground were destroyed.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to a British headquarters bulletin from New Delhi, Japanese bombers and fighters attacked airfields in southeastern Bengal, dropping countless bombs, causing heavy casualties and significant damage.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Melbourne, Japanese air forces heavily bombed the port of Cox's Bazar in southeastern Bengal on the 30th with large formations. On the same day, Japanese air forces also bombed the anti-Axis base in Oro Bay on New Guinea Island. Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to news from Melbourne, Japanese aircraft attacked Oro Bay in New Guinea again, destroying the anti-Axis base.</p>
<h3>Moro People of Mindanao Island Determined to Cooperate with Japan</h3>
<p>Manila, 31st (Central News Agency) – The Moro people on Mindanao Island have never submitted since the Americans occupied the Philippines forty years ago, causing constant trouble. However, according to the commander of the Japanese military administration unit in Mindanao, who recently inspected the island, the Japanese have been able to win the friendship of the Moro people. Currently, there are more than 65,000 Moro people living in peace and working happily, with complete trust in the Japanese. The tribe is now wholeheartedly cooperating with Japan to increase production and maintain order. This situation has been created entirely because the Japanese army treats all ethnic groups in the Philippines equally, regardless of their religious beliefs.</p>
<h3>Soviet Ambassador Litvinov Has Lengthy Meeting with Hull</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to news from Washington, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov had a lengthy meeting with US Secretary of State Hull yesterday. According to a statement released by the US State Department, the discussions between the Soviet Ambassador and Hull concerned the results of British Foreign Secretary Eden's visit to the United States.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 1st (Central News Agency) – The internal strife between the anti-Axis countries remains deep. The antagonism between the United States and the Soviet Union, despite Eden's efforts at mediation, has not been alleviated. According to a cable from New York, a public demonstration was held in New York on the 31st by New York residents protesting the recent death sentences imposed by the Soviet government on two leaders of the Polish socialist movement and executives of the International Socialist Line Committee.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Announces Appointment of Administrative Officials for the South Seas Area</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – It was announced here yesterday that eight chief administrative officials and twelve administrative officials have been appointed to the Japanese military administration headquarters in the South Seas area. The newly appointed chief administrative officials were previously employed as administrative officials by the Japanese army in the South Seas area.</p>
<h3>Fighting in Tunisia Spreads Northward</h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to a military correspondent for the Hague News Agency, the great battle in Tunisia is now spreading. As expected, the British First Army has now joined the Allied general offensive, but currently only a portion of its left flank is fighting in northern Tunisia, in the coastal area between Cape Serrat and Medjez el Bab. The British army is advancing with strong forces, attempting to force the Axis outposts in the Djebel Abiod area to retreat. The offensive of the British and American forces in other areas has been contained by German reserves. The British army, advancing north from Medjez el Bab, has also retreated without success. However, it is expected that a major battle will occur in this area, as air reconnaissance indicates that General Anderson is continuing to reinforce his left flank. On the other hand, further south in the area west of Kairouan, a strong American force is currently advancing east along a wide front. These American troops have no combat experience and have clearly been transferred from Morocco to the front. Therefore, although they are numerous, they have achieved nothing. Although the fighting is spreading, its focus remains in the north of central Tunisia, in the area of Maknassy. The central force of the American Fifth Army and the left flank of General Patton's force in the area of El Guettar have fought bitterly in that area for ten days, pushing to the Mediterranean coast. During this period, the American commander had to replenish his heavily depleted troops, even having to add previously uncommitted reserves. This shows that the Allied forces definitely have a numerical advantage on the entire African front, but this numerical advantage, coupled with the American forces in Maknassy and El Guettar, has been reinforced by elite British troops and is of no use, as the Allies have made very little progress to date. At the same time, the German and Italian armies have retreated, and the troops and supplies on the Mareth Line have not suffered significant losses. They have made all preparations to defend the new position along the isthmus between the eastern coast of Telferjat and the northern coast of Gabes. As of Tuesday evening, the American Eighth Army has only conducted blind probes of the shortened Axis new line with strong reconnaissance units. It is generally expected that a frontal offensive will occur soon, as the vast swamp in the area will not allow General Montgomery to implement his signature flanking maneuvers.</p>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) – Military sources announced last night that German artillery and bombers, as well as fast-flying fighter-bombers, destroyed 71 American tanks in the El Guettar area of central Tunisia on Tuesday. It is reported that hundreds of American tanks, along with large units of French troops, have repeatedly attacked the German lines, but each time they were shattered by the concentrated fire of the German army before reaching the German lines. The French suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency) – Reuters reported last night that the Allied-controlled Algiers radio station broadcast on Wednesday that British Marines had landed at the port of Sfax in Tunisia. London has completely denied this.</p>
<h3>No Major Changes in the Eastern Front Situation Due to Poor Road Conditions</h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to reports, there have been no major changes in the situation on the Eastern Front. Soviet troops are constantly launching large-scale attacks near Lakes Ilmen and Ladoga, and in the lower reaches of the Kupen River north of Smolensk. Furthermore, Soviet troops are currently reorganizing and urgently seeking to replenish troops and supplies, but due to poor road conditions and the activity of the German Air Force, they do not appear to have achieved their intended goals. The German Air Force has repeatedly conducted organized air raids on the Soviet front lines and rear bases, inflicting great damage on the Soviet troops. Information obtained from Soviet prisoners of war indicates that approximately 30% of the Soviet mechanized units and tank units have been destroyed. The railways have also been heavily damaged due to repeated bombings by the German Air Force. Soviet troops in the Kupen area attacked German forces with approximately 20 tanks, but were ultimately routed by the rapid concentrated attacks of German dive bombers and artillery. The Soviet troops lost 13 tanks in this attack. North of Bykhov, German forces formed a shock force of grenadiers and engineers that penetrated deep into Soviet positions, causing the superior Soviet forces to scatter and flee. Also, a portion of the Soviet infantry in the area west of Vyazma, on both sides of the Moscow-Roslavl railway, has been caught in a German encirclement and faces annihilation. Soviet troops in the area of Staraya Russa, south of Lake Ilmen, recently suffered great damage and have abandoned their offensive intentions. Furthermore, south of Lake Ladoga, German forces launched a fierce attack on Soviet troops, completely annihilating two artillery battalions and destroying nine Soviet tanks.</p>

<p>Ankara, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to reports from Tehran, the Pan-Iranian Railway from the Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea has been taken over by the US military.

<h3>The Start-to-Finish of the Japan-Soviet Provisional Fisheries Agreement</h3>
<p>Negotiations for the conclusion of the Japan-Soviet Provisional Fisheries Agreement have been underway between Japan and the Soviet Union in Kuibyshev since the end of last year, and have now been successfully concluded. On the 24th, domestic procedures in both countries were completed, and at 6:00 PM on the 25th (0:00 AM on the 26th Japan time), the agreement was formally signed at that location by the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sato, and the Acting Chairman of the People's Committee for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Lozovsky. The provisional agreement to that treaty, which was signed on March 20th of last year, expired on December 21st of last year. Before the expiration of the agreement, the governments of Japan and the Soviet Union had been negotiating since the beginning of February to extend the Japan-Soviet Basic Fisheries Treaty, which was signed in 1928, for another year, until the end of this year. The conclusion of the provisional agreement has now been achieved. The true intention of the Japanese government regarding this matter is to revise the Japan-Soviet Basic Fisheries Treaty and to conclude it as soon as possible. The provisional agreement that has now been concluded only delays and prolongs the current situation, which is very unsatisfactory. However, in any case, due to the conclusion of this eighth provisional agreement, Japanese interests in the North Pacific fisheries can be exercised satisfactorily this year, which can be said to be a fortunate event in light of the current international situation. Moreover, the incitement of Japan-Soviet estrangement by enemy countries such as Britain and the United States has proven to be futile in view of the friendly relations between the two countries, which have already concluded a neutrality treaty. Based on the Japan-Soviet treaty stipulated in the Treaty of Portsmouth, the Japanese fishing rights were confirmed, and the Japan-Soviet Basic Fisheries Treaty was concluded. The Japanese government is now urging the Soviet authorities to continue negotiations to revise the treaty. Regarding this matter, the government received a public announcement from Ambassador Sato upon completion of the signing, which was announced by the Information Bureau as follows:</p>
<p>(Announcement by the Information Bureau) 10:00 AM on the 26th, "Negotiations between Japan and the Soviet Union for a fisheries treaty were also conducted last year, but were not successful by the end of the year. Therefore, since December, consultations have been held to conclude a provisional agreement in order to extend the effective period of the current fisheries treaty until the end of this year. Negotiations have now been successful, and on March 25th, the provisional agreement was signed in Kuibyshev by the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sato, and the representative of the People's Committee for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Lozovsky."</p>
<p>As a result of the past Russo-Japanese War, Japan and Imperial Russia stipulated Japan's fishing rights in the North Pacific and confirmed them in the Treaty of Portsmouth. Based on that treaty, the first fisheries treaty, which stipulated the exercise of Japanese rights, was concluded at the beginning of Meiji 40 (1907), with a term of twelve years. Due to the revolution that occurred in the middle of that period, and the collapse of the Imperial regime, the Japanese government concluded a basic treaty with the newly established government of the Soviet Socialist Federal Republics in January of Taisho 14 (1925) and confirmed it. After that, as a result of conducting negotiations to conclude a revised treaty, on January 23rd of Showa 3 (1928), the treaty with a term of eight years was signed by the then Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Tanaka, and the Chairman of the People's Committee for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Karakhan, and the details of the changes were decided by the Hirota-Karakhan Agreement. The current treaty is, in fact, one in which the effective period has been extended year by year after the expiration of that treaty to the present day.</p>
<p>The Japan-Soviet Basic Fisheries Treaty signed in January of Showa 3 (1928) expired at the end of May of Showa 11 (1936). Prior to this, the two governments conducted negotiations to conclude a revised treaty, but no compromise was reached. In order to avoid a treaty-less situation, the first provisional agreement was concluded on May 25th of that year until the end of that year, and negotiations for revision were continued on the one hand. As a result, a draft agreement that both sides agreed to was obtained in December. However, the Soviet government misunderstood the true meaning of the Anti-Comintern Pact concluded between Japan and Germany at that time and refused to sign it, so the effort failed. As a result, on December 28th of that year, the second provisional agreement, with a term ending at the end of Showa 12 (1937), was concluded. At that time, the Japanese government felt extremely regretful.</p>
<p>After that, the Japanese government, based on legitimate rights vis-à-vis the Soviet Union, urged the Soviet government to conclude a revised treaty, but the Soviet government simply delayed and prolonged, and thus, there was a third (December 29th of Showa 12 (1937)), a fourth (April 2nd of Showa 14 (1939)), a fifth (December 31st of the same year), a sixth (January 20th of Showa 16 (1941)), and a seventh (March 20th of Showa 17 (1942)) provisional agreement was concluded year after year to extend its effectiveness. Although it was a temporary band-aid measure, it ultimately avoided the worst-case scenario of a treaty-less situation. Of course, the Japanese government, standing on its legitimate rights, would not be satisfied with the aforementioned measures. In the worst-case scenario of a treaty-less situation, Japan's exercise of its rights would provoke the worst possible situation between Japan and the Soviet Union, which was not the intention of the Japanese government, which sought world peace. For the benefit of all mankind, Japan was willing to endure self-restraint and acquiesce to the aforementioned measures. Thus, the seventh agreement originally expired at the end of last year. At the same time, in accordance with the provision of "to replace with a new treaty that can be concluded in 1942 during the current negotiations" in the seventh agreement, after the conclusion of the seventh agreement, the Japanese government continued to urge the Soviet government to conduct deliberations on revising the treaty. Until the end of November, negotiations had not been successful, and the 8th provisional agreement was consulted on since December of that year. Before the start of the fishing season this year, Sato and Lozovsky reached an agreement in their meeting on the 23rd, and it was finally concluded on the 25th.</p>
<p>As a result, the exercise of Japanese rights this year can be smoothly promoted. However, the sincerity of the Japanese government in concluding a revised treaty is asserted on the basis of legitimate rights as stipulated in the Treaty of Portsmouth and the Japan-Soviet Basic Treaty. The Soviet government should also observe international good faith this year, and in light of the spirit of the Neutrality Treaty, abandon all suspicions and anxieties, make an open announcement, accommodate Japan's demands, and promptly establish a revised treaty, so that relations between the two countries will become clearer as a result, and that the ambitions of Britain and the United States to dominate the world can be repelled, and that a contribution can be made to the construction of a new world for the common prosperity of nations.

<p>Asahi Shimbun Editorial</p>
<p>Soviet territory fisheries are the foundation of Japan's North Pacific fisheries. What Japan's ancestors pioneered cost the Japanese people precious blood during the past Russo-Japanese War, and it was exchanged for these undying fishing rights. This was reconfirmed in the Japan-Soviet Basic Treaty. There is no need to repeat it here.</p>
<p>The operation of these fishing rights is regulated by the Japan-Soviet Fisheries Agreement. Needless to say, the eighth Japan-Soviet Provisional Fisheries Agreement that has now been concluded is an extremely appropriate thing. In the current tense international environment, especially as the British and American camps continue to spread rumors of a Japan-Soviet crisis, and are using all means to instigate estrangement between Japan and the Soviet Union, the conclusion of this agreement is of great significance. Japan-Soviet relations are firmly established due to the Neutrality Treaty between the two countries. Foreign Minister Tani also stated in the January Diet that Japan respects the Neutrality Treaty and will not change its policy of diplomacy toward the Soviet Union. This policy is based on the prerequisite that the Soviet Union also observes the Neutrality Treaty. The fact that the Fisheries Agreement has been successfully concluded this time also completely demonstrates the Soviet government's spirit of observing the Neutrality Treaty. The maintenance of normal Japan-Soviet relations has now been reaffirmed.</p>
<p>If we want to point out dissatisfaction, then the fisheries agreement that has now been concluded is only a provisional agreement with a term of one year for this year, and this provisional agreement has been renewed as many as eight times. This agreement, which is renewed once a year, is truly cumbersome. We hope that the long-term Japan-Soviet Fisheries Treaty, which is clearly stated in the agreement, will be concluded as soon as possible, so that Japan-Soviet neutral relations can be established on a foundation of certainty and permanence.</p>
<p>Here, the provisional agreement for this year was able to bring temporary relief, but we re-emphasize that the long-term Japan-Soviet Basic Fisheries Treaty, which we have hoped for for many years, should be concluded as soon as possible this year.

<h3>Purchase of Cooking Oil with House Tax Receipts; Sales Scheduled to Begin Tomorrow; Distribution Standard Based on Number of People per Household; Price of $2.55 per Four Ounces per Person</h3>
<p>The supply of cooking oil in this city is scheduled to continue from tomorrow. The total amount to be distributed this time is estimated to be over 10,000 piculs. The method of sale is to purchase with winter house tax receipts. Each person is limited to four ounces. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Universal Supply, No Need to Rush</p>
<p>The sale of cooking oil this time will be distributed according to the population of each district and Baojia, and supplied to designated cooking oil retailers (all with numbered signs assigned by this office) for universal sale. Citizens will surely be able to purchase it, so there is no need to rush.</p>
<p>To avoid congestion, the names, numbers and addresses of all designated retailers in each district have been tabulated and posted for easy reference. If there is anything that is not clear, you can inquire at the retailer. Furthermore, the sale this time is only for soybean oil, which is priced at $1.836 per market catty, including taxes and war bonds, or $10.02 in legal tender (each four ounces costs $2.55).</p>
<p>Sales Method Has Been Determined</p>
<p>(1) In the Public Settlement and Hongkou, winter house tax receipts and the citizen's certificate of the head of the household must be presented. (2) In the French Concession, receipts for house taxes for the months of November and December and the identity card of the head of the household must be presented. (3) In Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong and Huxi, household registration certificates and the residence permit of the head of the household must be presented. (4) Each person is limited to four ounces this time, based on the number of people given rice on the back of the house tax receipt or the number of people listed on the household registration certificate. Regardless of the number of people in each household, the purchase should be made all at once and then distributed evenly without any withholding. (5) Daily sales hours are from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Implementation of Distribution by Headcount Still Pending</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of cooking oil supply in this city, the authorities of the two concessions issued a cooking oil certificate along with the rice and flour purchase certificates last month, in preparation for distribution by headcount. However, because the required amount of oil has not yet been sufficiently transported from the production areas, and the factories in this city have not been able to produce and squeeze it, it has not yet been implemented. The cooking oil industry wholesale department, seeing that residents are in urgent need of oil, has agreed to restore the method of selling oil by house tax receipts, with the approval of the military allocation authorities, as a temporary measure. The date on which the system of allocation by headcount with oil purchase certificates will be implemented is still pending a decision from the relevant parties.</p>
<p>31st Issue of Rice on Sale Starting Today</p>
<p>The 31st issue of rations for the two concessions will begin today. This time, each person can purchase two sheng of whole rice and half a sheng of broken rice for $7.50, and one catty and eight taels of flour for $3.50, totaling $11.</p>
<p>Sugar Allowance for Foreigners Increased to Two Catties</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Times" reports that, according to reliable sources, the monthly sugar allowance for foreigners will be increased from 1.3 catties to 2 catties. The allowance for Chinese will remain at half a catty. Sugar purchase certificates for April have been issued and can be redeemed at designated retailers starting today.</p>
<h3>Donation Report for "Shen Bao" Readers' Scholarship Fund</h3>
<p>The "Shen Bao" Readers' Scholarship Fund has been receiving donations from all walks of life in recent days in an endless stream. Yesterday, we received a generous donation of $1,000 from the gentlemen of the Sports Section of the Chinese Staff Club of the Municipal Council. We would like to thank them on behalf of the impoverished students. The scholarship donations received yesterday were: $1,000 from the Sports Section of the Chinese Staff Club of the Municipal Council, $100 from Liuyinxuan (submitted by Pu Jiting), and $5 from Mr. Yin, totaling $1,105 in legal tender. The remaining balance is $292,840.29.</p>
<h3>Restoration of Transportation Line in Eastern Zhejiang; Active Construction of Qiantang River Railway Bridge</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a spokesman for the Army Press Department in Shanghai reported in detail on the construction in eastern Zhejiang, stating that since the Japanese army occupied Jinhua, it has been actively engaged in various construction projects, which are now making rapid progress. Regarding the transportation section, the railway from Jinhua to Meichi has been opened to traffic, and the route from Meichi to the northern bank of the Qiantang River is expected to be opened to traffic on the 15th of this month. In the future, the entire line from Jinhua to the southern bank of the Qiantang River can be declared complete. As for the Qiantang River Bridge, which was severely damaged in the war, the Japanese army is actively repairing it, and it is expected to be restored to its original state by next spring. This time, in addition to the Japanese army railway units, the construction relies on the cooperation of the China Railway Engineering Team and the local people to gradually restore the most difficult transportation construction. The completion of the railway is of profound importance to the lifeline of the country and the people. The restoration of the Zhejiang-East Railway can be transferred to Shanghai via Hangzhou, across the Jinghu (Shanghai-Nanjing) Railway to the Jinpu (Tianjin-Pukou) Railway, to Dalian in Manchuria, and to Japan. In the future, it can also go from Japan through Korea, Manchuria, along the Jinpu Line through the Yuehan (Guangzhou-Hankou) Line to Vietnam, through Thailand and directly to Malaya. This is of great significance in the transportation aspect of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<h3>Retracing Footsteps in Japan of Yesteryear</h3>
<p>— Zhou Fohai</p>
<p>A youth must have ideals, aspirations, and ambition. Otherwise, they lack a soul. Having ideals, aspirations, and ambition requires diligence, training, and effort. Otherwise, it's mere delusion. Not to be arrogant, but in my youth, I had a soul, yet I was never presumptuous. My youthful aspirations and diligent studies have already been written about in "Record of Diligent Studies." However, that article only covered up to studying abroad in Japan, entering the First Higher School in Tokyo, and graduating. Now, I will briefly describe my life during my study abroad period after that time, as well as my experiences engaging in social movements during summer vacations back home.</p>
<p>At that time, the Chinese government designated five Japanese national schools, and anyone who passed the entrance exam for one of these five schools would receive government funding. The five schools were the First Higher School (leading to the Imperial University after graduation), Higher Normal School, Higher Technical School, Higher Commercial School, and Chiba Pharmaceutical College. Among the five schools, the most prominent and admired by female students at the time was the First Higher School. Its students, wearing caps with two white stripes, draped in capes, yet shod in geta (wooden sandals), strutted down the street, heads held high, singing loudly. If they committed minor transgressions, not only would the police ignore them, but society would find them charming. At that time, I was determined to enter the First Higher School, but it was extremely difficult to get into. I greatly envied the Chinese students studying there. Now, I had actually passed the exam, and the hat with two white stripes was on my head. This not only meant that I would receive government funding, solving my financial problems, but also that my ideals had been realized. Therefore, my happiness at that time far surpassed that of an old scholar passing the civil service exam. After the results were announced, I immediately pre-borrowed one month's tuition (then thirty-six yen per month) from the Hunan students in Japan management office and went to Boshu to escape the summer heat and go swimming in the sea.</p>
<p>After school started, I began to study diligently. I woke up at six-thirty in the morning and went to bed at eleven at night, spending at most two hours resting out of the sixteen or seventeen hours each day. Because there was so much to learn, I was already extremely busy with schoolwork. The foreign language subject alone included English, German, and Japanese classical literature. However, these subjects could not satisfy my thirst for knowledge, and extracurricular work took up more time than schoolwork. First, reading Chinese classical books. Second, at that time, the tides of socialism and democracy were surging, especially the revolutions in Russia and Germany, which greatly stimulated young people. Therefore, I was very interested in them and diligently read related books and magazines. Third, I was also very interested in Western history and the international situation at the time. Because it was the end of World War I and the League of Nations was being established, reading related magazines and books also took up a lot of my time. Usually, I would read Chinese books from the time I woke up until I went to school. Sometimes, I would get so engrossed in reading that I would recite aloud, regardless of whether the Japanese students next door found it annoying. After returning from class, I would read extracurricular books and then have dinner. After dinner, I would go to the used bookstores near the Imperial University gate to browse, using it as a walk, for about an hour. I would read until after eleven at night, then drag out my bedding from the oshiire (closet) and go straight to sleep. On Sunday mornings, I would still study, and in the afternoon, I would walk to the Chinese Youth Association in Kanda to read Chinese newspapers or visit fellow countrymen. During my year in the preparatory course at the First Higher School, every day was like this. I not only did not socialize with Japanese classmates, but I also rarely interacted with Chinese friends. I had never been to Yoshiwara (red-light district) or Asakusa (entertainment district), and I had not even been to the movies once. Only on Sunday evenings, when the Chinese Youth Association showed movies, would I occasionally go. My only daily entertainment was visiting used bookstores after dinner. This experience made a deep impression on me, and I still often have dreams about it.</p>
<p>Because I read books on international affairs, I also gained some insights. In a moment of excitement, I wrote an essay analyzing the international situation at the time and predicting its trends, which I submitted to the "National Salvation Daily" in Shanghai, run by students who had returned from studying in Japan. It was actually published and received good reviews. My middle school history and geography teacher, Mr. Deng Zhuming, sent me a letter from afar to encourage me, praising me greatly. This was my debut work.</p>
<p>I lived this way for a year. After graduating from the preparatory course, students were assigned to different schools as usual. Because I wanted to choose a quiet place, I requested to be assigned to the Seventh Higher School in Kagoshima.</p>
<p>Kagoshima is located at the southern end of Japan, with beautiful scenery, a mild climate, and simple and honest people. It is the hometown of Saigo Takamori, truly a wonderful place. At that time, there were thirteen or fourteen Chinese students at the Seventh Higher School. Chen Tian'ou, who served as a section chief under me for more than two years when I was the director of the political department of the headquarters, and who served as my secretary for more than five years when I was the director of the Jiangsu Education Department, and who later served as my secretary again when I was the minister of the Ministry of Civil Service, was a classmate at that time and arrived in Kagoshima a year before me. After I left Chongqing, he is still serving as a secretary in the Ministry of Civil Service. My old friend who helped me for ten years is still struggling in the officialdom and cannot realize his ambitions. I truly feel sorry for him. Moreover, now that we are separated by mountains and rivers, and letters are difficult to send, how can the sight of the setting moon on the roof beams not make one nostalgic for old friends and feel sorrowful!</p>
<p>In the first year, besides schoolwork, I only focused on reading books on socialism and international affairs, and I had no time to read anything else. Outside of reading, my interest in writing essays and translating books greatly increased. That year, I translated the book "Overview of Social Problems," about sixty or seventy thousand words, and sold it to the Zhonghua Book Company, earning a manuscript fee of one hundred and twenty yuan. I saved this money for travel expenses to return home during the summer vacation to visit my family. At that time, Liang Qichao's faction ran a bi-monthly publication in Shanghai called "Liberation and Reconstruction," to which I often contributed. My articles were always published, and the manuscript fees were very generous. Most of this money was sent home to support my mother, and some was used to buy books.</p>
<p>My extracurricular entertainment consisted of sightseeing and going to the movies. Sakurajima, an island in the bay, is a volcano that erupted in 1915. When I went there, the summit still often emitted smoke, and the loquats and radishes on the island tasted especially good. Several classmates and I often rowed a small boat on Sundays to the island to play. Every afternoon, I would either ride my bicycle alone along the coast to the seaside cliffs called Isohama to see the sea, or climb the mountain behind the school called Shiroyama to enjoy the distant view. My movie-going friend was Chen Tian'ou. After dinner, the two of us would talk about movies and then, regardless of wind or rain, walk from our residence called Shiroyadani to the movie district, Tenmonkan Street. The round trip was about seven or eight li (Chinese miles), and we often ran in the rain at night, both of us holding an umbrella and wearing a pair of high-heeled geta. Sometimes, there was a good movie, but we had run out of money, and the government funding had not yet been sent from Tokyo. We would both be very anxious, hoping for the postman to arrive. However, if the postman came and delivered a regular letter, we would still be disappointed because remittance letters were always registered. I would sometimes tease him by entering from outside and shouting loudly, "Shorui!" (registered letter). He would think that the postman with the remittance had arrived and come out to look, only to find that it was me. Sometimes, while waiting for the postman, the fertilizer on the surrounding vegetable gardens would stink so badly that it would be annoying. Thus, I would loudly recite, "Before and after are manure buckets, no postman comes and goes," to amuse myself.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1920, I decided to return to Yuanling to visit my mother. After calculating, I had little money left besides the travel expenses. I wanted to make a suit, but after counting, I didn't have enough money to make one. So I had to return home wearing my student uniform. I didn't know that as soon as I arrived in Shanghai, I could no longer move forward. Because at that time, Zhang Jingyao was the military governor of Hunan, and our Hunan army rose up to drive out Zhang, the war situation was tense, and the roads were blocked. I didn't know about this situation at all in Kagoshima. This time, I was returning home entirely to visit my mother, but now I couldn't achieve my goal. Recalling how three years ago, when I left home to study abroad, my mother was sad herself but also afraid that I would be sad, so she hid in the kitchen and sobbed with her back to me, I wished I could immediately kneel at my mother's feet, fall into her arms, and comfort her. But thousands of miles away, what could I do besides looking at the white clouds and shedding tears of longing for my family? Writing to this point, imagining where my mother is now and what her situation is like, I truly feel so distressed that I don't want to live! Still using the methods of the Three Kingdoms period to engage in politics is really meaningless.</p>
<p>Since I couldn't go home, I planned to go to Hangzhou to play. Before leaving, I went to the Shishi Xinbao newspaper office to visit Zhang Dongsun, who was the editor of "Liberation and Reconstruction." Because of my contributions, I often corresponded with him. When I arrived at the newspaper office, he hadn't arrived yet. An editor with the surname Yu came out to greet me. Soon, a person came, who was an important figure in the Research Group, and who returned from a tour of Europe with Liang Qichao. I don't remember his name clearly. Yu introduced us, introducing me as someone named Zhou, who writes articles. His introduction was not wrong, but I was very unhappy. At that time, I had extraordinary ambitions and considered myself a future great politician or revolutionary leader. But now, I was being called "someone who writes articles," being seen as a mere writer. Thus, I felt it was a form of belittlement. Writers naturally have their value and importance, but my ambition was not there at the time. Later, when Zhang Dongsun arrived, we had a very投机 conversation. They often organized the "Mutual Learning Society" to translate famous works, and they asked me to translate one as well. I took on the task of translating Kropotkin's "Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution."</p>
<p>I stayed at the Zhiguo Temple in West Lake, and every day, besides translating books and reading, I would row a boat and climb mountains with a few friends. Sometimes, I would even jump into the lake to swim. I had visited every famous scenic spot near West Lake. However, West Lake was extremely hot in the summer. After the sun set, the lake water reflected the heat, making it feel especially stuffy. After staying for more than three weeks, because the heat was unbearable, I returned to Shanghai.</p>
<p>When I arrived in Shanghai, Zhang Dongsun told me that Chen Duxiu wanted to see me. Duxiu was originally a professor at Peking University, who hosted "New Youth" and promoted new ideas, which was disliked by the authorities at the time. So he resigned and came to Shanghai, and "New Youth" was also moved to Shanghai for publication. One day, Zhang Dongsun, Shen Yanbing, and I went to No. 2 Yuyang Lane, Huanlong Road (now it seems to have been renamed Mingde Lane) to visit Duxiu. At that time, Wu Tingkang, the Far East representative of the Third International from Russia, was present. Wu basically said, "Although the tide of new ideas in China is surging now, first, it is too complex, with anarchism, syndicalism, social democracy, and guild socialism, a mishmash with no mainstream, making the ideological world a chaotic situation. Second, there is no organization. There are many people who write articles and talk empty words, but there is no practical action at all. This will never be able to promote the Chinese revolution." His conclusion was that he hoped we would organize the "Chinese Communist Party." There was no result from the discussion that day. Dongsun did not agree, so he did not attend subsequent meetings. Yanbing and I agreed. After several meetings, it was decided to organize. Duxiu was responsible for the south, and Li Dazhao was responsible for the north. This was the so-called "Chen in the South, Li in the North" at the time. Those who joined in Shanghai at that time included Shao Lizi and Shen Xuanlu. Dai Jitao was also one. However, he said that as long as Mr. Sun Yat-sen was alive, he could not join another party. So although he drafted the initial draft of the "Chinese Communist Party Program," he did not join. At this time, it was only preparing the organization, and it had not been formally established. It was planned to establish organizations of a preparatory nature in Beijing, Hankou, Changsha, Guangzhou, and other places within a year, and then hold a conference of representatives from various regions in the summer of the following year to formally establish the party. As I was planning the plan and dispatching people to work separately, it happened that school was about to start, so I returned to the school in Kagoshima.</p>
<p>Why did I agree to organize the Communist Party and take the lead in participating? First, for two years, I had read many books on communism and the Russian Revolution. I unknowingly believed in the ideals of communism. At the same time, I was very dissatisfied with the politics of the warlords and bureaucrats in China at that time, and I was stimulated by the Russian Revolution, thinking that it was not enough to save China without eliminating those ruling classes and establishing a revolutionary government. This is the public reason. Second, there was a personal motive. An honest person doesn't do anything in secret, and a sincere person doesn't tell lies. I will never hide that there was a personal motive at that time: I will never tell a lie and say that the motive at that time was entirely for the country and the people. However, the personal motive was not to get promoted, not to get rich, and not to enjoy pleasure. It was like this at that time, it was like this later, and it is still like this now. Speaking of personal enjoyment, there is no one so stupid to do such stupid things. Even now, some people may think that our peace movement is for personal enjoyment. In fact, it is a great injustice. According to my personal situation now, I can't go to the movies that I love the most, I can't go to the old dramas that I love the most, I want to go to the park but I can't, I want to stroll on the road but I can't. At home, I am like a bird in a cage, and outside, I am like a prisoner being escorted. Every day, I only eat three meals and sleep on a bed. I can't乱作胡爲 like the warlords and bureaucrats of the past, indulging in extravagance and depravity. Not only that, but even the happiness that ordinary people can enjoy, I can't enjoy, and the things that ordinary people can do, I can't do. Is this situation enjoyment? Or is it suffering? Although I was a poor student at the time and could not foresee the situation now, I was definitely not aiming for this. The so-called personal motive at that time was political ambition, political ambition. At the First Higher School, it was around the time of the Paris Peace Conference, and diplomats from various countries were greatly showing off their talents. Therefore, I was very fascinated by Versailles at that time, harboring an ambition to become a great diplomat in the future who could negotiate and mediate, galloping on the international stage, and winning glory for the country. Later, after studying the history of the Russian Revolution, I had another ambition to become a revolutionary leader who could lead the broad masses of people, overthrow the ruling class, and establish a revolutionary regime. The impressions of figures such as Lenin and Trotsky often lingered in my mind. Tossing and turning, starting early and sleeping late, I wanted to become such a figure. Although I am now almost fifty years old and have achieved nothing, the豪情 of my intentions at that time could really soar to the clouds! A youth harboring such ambitions, and at a time when Chinese politics were corrupt and the revolutionary tide in the world was rising, how could I not organize a new revolutionary party based on the spirit of creation? This is the reason why I participated in the founding of the "Chinese Communist Party."</p>
<p>After returning to Kagoshima, besides attending classes, I still studied the writings of Marx, Lenin, and others, and published articles. At the same time, I wanted to lead the masses. Besides writing articles, the most important thing was public speaking. So I gathered a dozen Chinese classmates and organized a lecture meeting. We gave lectures once a week to practice public speaking. At that time, my classmates all said that I had a talent for public speaking and that my speeches were very moving. Hearing these encouragements, I became even more self-important, even calling myself the Chinese Lenin. Looking back now, it seems ridiculous, but in youth, one should have such a self-important attitude.</p>
<p>Several friends and I rented a house and prepared our own meals. We had Chinese food to eat every day, and life was more comfortable than in Tokyo. However, there were still many hardships. We would never change a pair of socks until they had holes in the bottom. There were many mosquitoes on summer nights, and we didn't have money to buy mosquito nets. Afraid of lighting mosquito coils, we could only use a newspaper to cover our heads. Although we could avoid mosquitoes, the ink smell of the newspaper was really disgusting! This year, I finished translating "Mutual Aid."</p>
<p>Then, I received letters from comrades in Shanghai, informing me that a conference of representatives would be held in July. Coincidentally, it was during the summer vacation, so I returned to Shanghai. The party affairs had developed really fast. Not only had the organizations we had planned last year been established in Shanghai, Hankou, Changsha, Beijing, and Guangzhou, but there was also a branch in Jinan. At that time, Chen Jiongming was in power in Guangdong and had not yet betrayed the revolution. So Duxiu went to Guangdong to serve as the chairman of the Guangdong Education Committee. Therefore, he could not personally preside over the conference of representatives. The representative from Guangdong was Gong Bo, from Beijing were Zhang Guotao and Liu Renjing, from Changsha were Mao Zedong and an old gentleman with the surname He, and from Hankou were Chen Tanqiu and Bao Huiseng. I don't remember who was from Jinan. Although Ding Mocun was not a representative, he was an active member of the CY (Communist Youth League) and was also in Shanghai. I was considered the representative of the students studying in Japan. In fact, no one from Kagoshima participated, and there was only one person, Shi Cuntong, from Tokyo. I was considered to represent Shi and myself. The Third International also sent Ma Lin as the supreme representative. Mao Zedong and three or four others and I lived upstairs at the Bowen Girls' School near Beile Road. At that time, the students were on summer vacation, so we rented it. There were no beds, so we all slept on the floorboards. For meals, we of course ate bao fan (a meal service). We held meetings every night at Li Hanjun's home on Beile Road. Ma Lin and Wu Tingkang also attended. On the fourth night of the meeting, Ma Lin, who had experience, said, "We must change places tomorrow night. We have been holding meetings here for several nights in a row, which will definitely attract the attention of the police." We said that since there was only one night left tomorrow and it was not easy to find another place, it would probably be fine. So we decided to stay in the same place. That afternoon, I suddenly had severe abdominal pain and diarrhea and couldn't go out. I slept on the floor thinking about the steps to carry out the work, and I fell asleep in a daze. At about twelve o'clock, I suddenly woke up and saw Mao Zedong poking his head into the room, gently asking me, "Has there been any trouble here?" I was shocked and asked him, and then I knew that something had happened.</p>
<p>It turned out that while they were holding a meeting, a stranger suddenly ran into the room. Because there were no guards at the door at that time, and Hanjun's home was shared with fellow villagers, no one stopped this person from going upstairs. After he entered the room and took a look, he said, "Sorry, wrong room." After he finished speaking, he immediately retreated. Ma Lin was actually sharp-eyed and said, "Quick, disband, it must be a detective." So they immediately disbanded the meeting. Only Gong Bo stayed to chat with Hanjun. In less than a quarter of an hour, French detectives, Annamese police, and Chinese informants surrounded the house and rushed upstairs. The detectives asked them why they were holding a meeting, and they said that everyone was a student from Peking University, who were discussing 出一种杂志和丛书, so they were holding a meeting. The detectives then asked why there were two foreigners. They said that the two were professors at Peking University, who had been invited to guide them. A Chinese detective pointed at Gong Bo and said, "Aren't you Japanese?" It turned out that although Gong Bo was confident that his Beijing dialect was as good as a Beijinger's, others felt that he sounded like a foreigner speaking Chinese. So they insisted that he was Japanese. After a long explanation, they were able to prove that he was from Guangdong. The police saw that Hanjun's bookshelf was full of socialist books, so they gave him a lecture, saying that he shouldn't read these books. After questioning for a while, they left. Fortunately, the police did not search them. Both of them had draft party programs in their pockets. If they had been found, there would have been no reason for them not to go to the police station! Gong Bo was on his honeymoon with his newlywed wife at the Dadong Hotel at the time. After the police left, he was afraid that someone would follow him, so he didn't dare to return to the hotel directly. He went around several amusement parks before returning to the hotel. Who knew that in the room right next to his, a case of adultery and murder occurred that night. Two shots were fired, killing a woman. Gong Bo's wife was really frightened out of her wits. Mao Zedong thought that the Bowen Girls' School must have also been discovered and was afraid to go back. He probed around from afar for a long time before daring to go in. These words were all what I heard them say later.</p>
<p>After listening to Mao Zedong's report, I felt that it was a pity that our efforts had fallen short. I discussed with him that we must continue the meeting tomorrow, but it was probably impossible within the Shanghai Concession. I suddenly remembered that Li Heming's (Jian) wife was from Jiaxing. Why not go to Jiaxing to hold the meeting? So I mustered my strength and ran to Yuyang Lane to discuss it, because Heming lived in Duxiu's home. We discussed and decided that Heming's wife would take the morning train to Jiaxing tomorrow and first hire a large boat to wait. We would take the second train and take a boat tour of South Lake. So we notified everyone separately that night. On the second day, people went to the North Station in twos and threes to board the train. I also went, despite my illness. When we arrived in Jiaxing, Heming's wife was already waiting at the station and escorted us onto the boat. The locals thought we were touring South Lake and didn't pay much attention. We sailed the boat into the lake, and suddenly a heavy rain poured down. We started the meeting on the boat, passed the party program and the party organization, and elected Chen Duxiu as chairman, I as vice-chairman, Zhang Guotao as head of the organization department, and Li Heming as head of the propaganda department. Before Duxiu arrived in Shanghai, I was acting as chairman. The "Chinese Communist Party" was thus formally established in a lone boat in the misty rain and vast lake. At that time, we had full of hope for this party and were determined to devote all our energy to fighting for it. Who knew that bad elements would join later, and it would become worse and worse, eventually turning into bandits who killed, burned, and massacred cities and villages, as cruel as Zhang Xianzhong and Li Zicheng. Therefore, most of the figures at the First National Congress later announced their withdrawal from the party. Gong Bo went to Guangdong not long after, and then went to the United States to study, essentially withdrawing from the party. Li Hanjun, Li Heming, and I withdrew in 1924 or 1925. Liu Renjing was expelled and became a Trotskyist. Our supreme leader at the time, Chen Duxiu, also withdrew in 1926 or 1927. Zhang Guotao was still active in the east for a long time after the Kuomintang launched a campaign to suppress the Communists, but he also withdrew in 1937 and is now in Chongqing, working with Chen Lifu to carry out anti-communist work. I met Duxiu in Nanjing in the autumn of 1937 and Guotao in Hankou in the spring of 1938. Recalling the past, I have a sense of being in another world. When we founded the Communist Party, we never dreamed that it would deteriorate to become bandits. The person who started it is truly guilty!</p>
<p>After the congress, we assigned responsible persons to various places to go and work separately, and at the same time, we became active in Shanghai. We felt that practical work should start with the labor movement. So we established a "Labor Union Secretariat" to launch and direct the Shanghai labor movement. "Labor Union" is a Japanese term. "Secretariat" is a translation of a Russian term. Combining a Japanese term and a Russian term to form the name of a labor movement organization took a lot of thought and shows how naive we were at the time. But the spirit of hard work is admirable. For example, the workers in the Japanese-run yarn mills wanted to learn Japanese. I opened a Japanese night school in the area where the workers lived. I myself went to teach for two hours every other night. We all lived up to the slogan of "Go to the people." Not only that, the funds at that time were provided by Russia. Ma Lin and I met not at the New World, the Great World, but on the rooftop garden of the Wing On Company. Just as the secret work was in full swing, the summer vacation was coming to an end, and I had to return to school to attend classes. So I repeatedly telegraphed Duxiu to come to Shanghai to hand over the work before going to Kagoshima. Duxiu did resign from his position in Guangdong and came to Shanghai. Who knew that an unexpected event would suddenly occur after he arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<p>I don't remember now, but for some reason, Duxiu and Ma Lin had different opinions, although they had not met. Duxiu was a tough guy and insisted that Ma Lin admit his mistake before he would meet him. But Ma Lin refused to admit his mistake. While we were at loggerheads, one day I was at Duxiu's home discussing a compromise solution when Duxiu's wife pulled me into playing cards. It was extremely 滑稽. Duxiu's wife, Yang Mingzhai (a Shandongese who returned from Russia), and I started playing mahjong. Duxiu and Lizi were talking upstairs. Suddenly, Bao Huiseng ran over and said, "I just came from Fudeli and met Miss Yang on the road going to your place." It turned out that my secret residence was in Fudeli, Chengdu Road. I was in love with Shuhui at that time, who had been introduced to me by Heming's wife. After hearing Huiseng's words, I let him play my cards and returned to Fudeli. Shuhui was waiting for me, and I asked her to take a walk in the French Park. When passing Yuyang Lane, she wanted to see Duxiu's wife, but I stopped her. After walking in the park, I sent her home and went to see Ma Lin. He asked me to bring a letter to Duxiu, even taking out the title of representative of the Third International, and saying to Duxiu in the letter, "If you are a true communist, you must listen to the orders of the Third International." I took this letter back to Yuyang Lane, and it was already dusk. I knocked on the back door, and suddenly a Shandong man asked, "Who are you looking for?" I said, "Mr. Chen." He said, "He's not home." I immediately felt very strange and quickly left. I thought there was no one like this in Duxiu's family, so why was he so fierce? Not long after I returned to Fudeli, Chen Wangdao ran over in a panic and said, "Duxiu, Lizi, Huiseng, Mingzhai, and Duxiu's wife have all been arrested and taken to the police station. Your place must be very dangerous. Quickly burn the important documents and hide." After hearing the news, I was very surprised. Later, I heard everyone say that this was the whole story. It turned out that half an hour after I left, the police came and surrounded the place, arresting everyone. Huiseng took my place, and since he didn't report Miss Yang's matter, of course it was me who was arrested, not him. If I had listened to Shuhui and gone to see Duxiu's wife when I passed Yuyang Lane, Shuhui and I would have been arrested as well. I escaped these two dangers. What a coincidence! This is not the only danger, there was still danger. It turned out that Duxiu did not admit that he was Chen Duxiu after arriving at the police station. The police station thought that they had not arrested Chen Duxiu, so they ordered the informant guarding his room to arrest anyone who went to Chen's house, regardless of who they were. It happened that Chu Fucheng went to visit Duxiu, and the informant arrested Chu without asking questions. When Chu arrived at the police station, the superiors recognized him and asked him why he went to Chen's house. He of course said that he was visiting Chen. They then asked him if he knew Chen Duxiu. He said how could he visit him if he didn't know him. The police station personnel said that they would take him to see him. So they took him to the detention place. Duxiu was about to gesture to him not to point him out, but Chu shouted loudly, "Duxiu, what's going on!" So the matter was exposed. The police station then notified the informant guarding Chen's house that Chen Duxiu had been arrested and that no one else should be arrested, and I went to deliver the letter after the informant received the notification. Otherwise, I would also have been arrested. If the documents of the representative of the Third International had been found on my body, I would have been caught red-handed, and wouldn't I have been sentenced to several years in prison? These words were all what everyone told me later after they came out. I escaped this third danger, which was really a blessing for everyone. Otherwise, a group of people would have been imprisoned for several years. Lizi and Duxiu's wife were released on bail that night. But rescuing Duxiu was very troublesome. At this time, another important thing happened.</p>
<p>It turned out that in 1921, the United States convened the Washington Naval Conference. The Third International believed that this was a conference to carve up small and weak nations, so it convened a Conference of the Toiling Peoples of the East in Irkutsk to plan resistance. China was to convene sixty or seventy representatives of workers, peasants, merchants, and youths to send to attend. The time was very short, and there was no preparation, which made me very anxious. After discussing it several times, we sent people to convene people from major cities in the south, centered on Guangzhou, and major cities in the north, centered on Beijing. I personally went to the Yangtze River area. So I entrusted the matter of rescuing Duxiu to Lizi and others, and took a direct ship to Changsha.</p>
<p>When I crossed to Japan, the ship I took from Changsha to Shanghai was not only not a steerage cabin, but not even a fourth-class cabin. I sat and slept on bags of rice being shipped to Shanghai. This time, in order to disguise myself, I took a first-class cabin. When I ate for the first time, five or six waiters stood around serving the rice, and I felt very uneasy sitting there because it was my first experience. I thought that since we are all human beings, why can we sit and eat while they have to stand and serve? But after two or three days, I got used to it and didn't feel uneasy anymore. It can be seen that a person's sincere and pure soul can easily be corrupted. However, I still had a very strong basic concept of respecting humanity. I would never scold my adjutants unless they did something wrong, not to mention my other subordinates. But some people still said that I was a bureaucrat and had a big airs. This is a great injustice. There were many people I couldn't meet, but I really didn't have time. My time was to be used for the most effective work, how could I use it to listen to other people's resumes and complaints? There was not enough time to spare, and I even had to meet guests and deal with matters on Sundays. It was natural that I was not thoughtful enough, but how could I have big airs? Maybe my environment made me look like a bureaucrat, but in fact, my scholar nature has never changed in the slightest. There are many misunderstandings. Last year, when I returned from Japan, I took a night train from Shanghai to Nanjing. The weather was cold and early, and I never expected that anyone would pick me up at the station. When I got off the train, I saw senior colleagues from the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank standing in front of the train. I thought there were only a few people, so I nodded and thanked them before leaving the station. Later, someone told me that many people from the Social Movement Association and other agencies had gone to pick me up at the time, and they scolded me for having big airs because I didn't greet them. In fact, how did I know that so many people were going to pick me up? There is no need to explain these things, and I don't ask for anyone's understanding. But writing to this point, I can't help but naturally write it down. Let's get back to the topic and not say any more off-topic words.</p>
<p>When I arrived in Changsha, I stayed at the famous Dajixiang Hotel at the time. I went to see Mao Zedong overnight. He was running an Autonomy University at Zenggong Temple at the time. There were no professors, and there were no classes, but it was called a university, which shows the chaos in the cultural world at the time after the May Fourth Movement. He lived in the school. After I went in, I saw him reading a book under the lamp from a distance. It turned out that he was using a red pen to circle Li Houzhu's poems. He was startled when he saw me suddenly arrive. I told him the whole story, and we discussed the solution overnight. Within three days, we gathered more than twenty people. Of course, most of them were young students, and there was not a single farmer, but there were two or three workers. I met them separately, set the date and place for the meeting, and distributed travel expenses before leaving Changsha. Although the warlords at that time did not have special agents and there was no Blue Shirts Society, they did have their detective teams, but they were not very sensitive. Half a day after I boarded the boat, Zhao Hengti sent someone to search the Dajixiang. Last year, I decided to go home to visit my mother, but the road was blocked. This year, I arrived in Changsha but could not go home. The affairs of the world are really beyond human calculation! Not only could I not go home, but also because of the secret work, I couldn't send letters from Changsha, so I left Changsha in disappointment.</p>
<p>When I arrived in Hankou, I went to Wuchang to look for Chen Tanqiu. He was a teacher in a middle school. After discussing with him, we gathered more than ten people within two days. I went to visit the Yellow Crane Tower with him in my spare time. Looking at the scenery of the Yangtze River, it was really "Where is</p>

<h3>Materials Control Deliberation Committee Holds First Meeting in Shanghai Yesterday, Approves Four Important Cases</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai) The National Government, in order to strengthen materials control and urge the National Commercial Control Association to perfect its operational functions, established the Materials Control Deliberation Committee. It held its first meeting at 4:30 PM yesterday (the 1st) on the third floor of the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank at No. 15 Huangpu Beach Road, Shanghai. All committee members and staff attended. First, Chairman Zhou Fohai presided and reported on the significance of establishing the Materials Control Deliberation Committee. Then, Tang Shoumin, Chairman of the National Commercial Control Association, reported on the organization and establishment of the association. Immediately afterward, four important cases were passed for deliberation until the meeting adjourned at approximately 8:00 PM. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Committee Members and Staff</p>
<p>Those attending included Chairman Zhou Fohai, Committee Member and Minister of Industry Mei Siping, Minister of Food Gu Baoheng, Minister of Construction Chen Junhui, Director of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance Shao Shijun, General Manager He Bingxian, Chairman of the National Commercial Control Association Tang Shoumin, Committee Members from the Japanese authorities Minister Horiuchi, Minister Tajiri, Chief Secretary and Vice Minister of Industry Yuan Yuqian, Secretary Wang Jiajun, Director Tao Guoxian, Director Liu Ruxiang, Director Yin Yixuan, Director Tang Wenjie, Counselor Zhang Shizheng, Deputy Director Zhang Jun, Director of the Municipal Economic Bureau Wang Zhigang, Foreign Affairs Consultants Okada, Consultant Kabashima, Investigator Monota, Investigator Kuwahara, Secretary Toganaga, Secretary Ishisato, Major Suzutani, Accounting Lieutenant Colonel Shiomi, Accounting Captain Ishii, Director of the Economic Department Ishii, Director of the Economic Department Okuda, Colonel Nagai, Colonel Itotsuchi, Colonel Shimazu, Lieutenant Colonel Fukuchi, and 33 others.</p>
<p>Chairman Zhou's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Zhou Fohai reported on the significance of establishing the Materials Control Deliberation Committee, stating: After the National Government entered the war, it passed the wartime economic policy outline at the National Defense Conference, with the highest goals of ensuring military needs and stabilizing people's livelihoods. The main means of implementation are to increase production, conserve consumption, stabilize prices, regulate finance, and transform economic institutions. Based on this policy, the Provisional Regulations for the Control of Wartime Materials Movement were promulgated on March 11th of this year. At the same time, with the cooperation of friendly nations, the regulations on the movement of materials in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River were lifted, allowing free flow of materials in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, except for the Shanghai area. In order to complete the purchase and distribution agencies, the government promulgated the Provisional Regulations of the National Commercial Control Association on March 11th. In accordance with these regulations, the National Commercial Control Association was established to handle materials control matters and assist the government in implementing national policies. By order of the Executive Yuan, Tang Shoumin was appointed as Chairman, Wu Zhenxiu and others as Directors, Wen Lanting as Supervisor, and Zhou Zuomin and others as Supervisors. It was established on March 15th and began operations. Subsequently, in order to improve the operation of the materials control and the National Commercial Control Association, the government established the Materials Control Deliberation Committee. The National Government specifically appointed me as Chairman, and Minister of Industry Mei Siping and others as Committee Members, and also invited Minister Horiuchi and others from friendly nations as Committee Members. Furthermore, staff were appointed under the committee to assist in the committee's affairs. The Executive Yuan appointed Vice Minister of Industry Yuan Yuqian as Chief Secretary, Director Wang Jiajun of the Ministry of Industry and others as Secretaries, and invited Investigator Monota and others from friendly nations as Secretaries. The committee has two tasks: on the one hand, it is a deliberation body of the National Government, and on the other hand, it is a communication and liaison body between China and Japan in materials control. The mission of the committee is very important. As the committee's work begins, I have been ordered to serve as Chairman. I feel that I am not talented enough and fear the dangers of my position. Moreover, the intricacies of materials control are numerous. Without careful planning, the National Commercial Control Association's operation, the organization of lower-level agencies, and the operation of purchase and distribution agencies will not succeed. I deeply hope that everyone will assist together. Today, all of you from friendly nations present are deeply aware of China's economic situation and have provided great assistance to the National Government's economic administration in the past. In the future, I hope that everyone will continue to exert their efforts to assist the committee so that it can exert its strength and fulfill the mission of ensuring military needs and stabilizing people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>Important Cases Passed for Deliberation</p>
<p>(1) Passed the translation of the organizational outline of the Upper House of Parliament; (2) Amended and passed the essential guidelines for the implementation of materials control; (3) Passed the essential guidelines for the establishment and implementation of the National Commercial Control Association; (4) Amended and passed the organizational outline of the National Commercial Control Association and the description and diagram of the purchase and distribution system.</p>
<h3>Public Notes Issued by Member Banks to be Honored by the United Bank</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen the reserves of member banks, the United Bank Reserve Committee stipulates in accordance with the articles of association that member banks should submit property as reserves and issue public notes and treasury certificates for 70% of the assessed value of the property submitted by the member banks. These public notes and treasury certificates are registered and can be used as collateral to borrow at full value from the committee and member banks. At the same time, treasury certificates can be exchanged for public notes from the committee. The committee uses the following funds as reserves to meet public notes: (1) Funds deposited by member banks. (2) Balance of funds collected and paid by member banks on behalf of the committee. (3) Funds borrowed from other banks. As for public notes issued by member banks, holders who wish to cash them can request the committee to honor them at any time. The committee then collects the funds from the bank that used the public notes. However, if the market price of the reserve property submitted by member banks falls, they must be notified to replenish it at any time. If the replenishment is not fulfilled, the committee may sell the depreciated reserve property at the market price to offset the various notes used. The surplus is returned to the bank that used the notes, and the deficit is still collected.</p>
<h3>Economic Bureau Investigates Silver Houses and Pawnshops' Loans Secured by Commodities</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai) Recently, local merchants in the city have been using loans secured by commodities from silver houses and pawnshops to raise funds for hoarding and speculation, causing prices to rise and the people's livelihood to decline. It is reported that the Municipal Economic Bureau, in accordance with the provisions of the subsidiary rules for the regulation of loans secured by commodities of silver houses and pawnshops under the central government's provisional regulations for stabilizing prices, is thoroughly investigating the commodity-secured loan situation of various silver houses and pawnshops in the city in order to effectively prevent the above-mentioned abuses. They have formulated a survey form and instructed the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to forward it to the silver and pawnshop guilds, notifying the various firms to fill it out and submit it within the prescribed time.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Coal Industry Federation Decides on Control Measures</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Industry Federation, in view of the many aspects of coal industry management that need to be improved, has decided on the following control measures.</p>
<p>Merchants selling coal separately north of the Suzhou River</p>
<p>(including the two concessions, Nanshi, Huxi, etc.) must uniformly join the Shanghai Special Municipality Coal Small Retailers Federation and be under the control of the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company.</p>
<p>Merchants selling coal separately south of the Suzhou River</p>
<p>(including Hongkou, Zhabei, etc.) must uniformly join the Hongkou Coal Small Retailers Association and accept the instructions of the Shanghai Coal Federation. In addition to those who have already applied to join the association, approximately 340 coal small retailers must join the Shanghai Special Municipality Coal Small Retailers Federation, and approximately 40-50 (including Japanese merchants) must join the Hongkou Coal Small Retailers Distribution Association. These coal small retailers operate in the following areas according to the rules of the trade union!</p>
<p>(1) The sales area of members of the association is the area approved by the former Asia Development Board, Huazhong Liaison Department, as the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company. (2) If a member of the association has insufficient coal inventory, they should report it to the trade union. (3) Members of the association should post the retail price list in a prominent place at the door of the store. (4) The retail price of members of the association should comply with the price set by the former Asia Development Board, Huazhong Liaison Department, and should not exceed this price limit. Violators will be severely punished. (Mainland New Daily, March 31)</p>

Violators will have their distribution cards revoked and reported to the authorities for investigation.</p>
<h3>Discussion on the Implementation of Commercial Control (2)</h3>
<p>– Gao Maodong</p>
<p>(2) Establish a permanent inventory system to control various industries. Ordinary higher-level agencies often rely on laws and regulations to exercise their supervisory and governing powers over their lower-level agencies. In the control system, this supervisory power also has its important function, but it cannot achieve the function of controlling the receipt and payment of materials. To achieve this goal, a method must be designed to directly control the accounts of lower-level agencies. What is this method? It is to establish a controlling permanent inventory system. After the establishment of this accounting system, the inventory of various industries can be obtained at any time on the books of the Control Association. This can be achieved by using the methods used in cost accounting, but at the same time, the spirit of government accounting must also be adopted, and various memorandum records must be used to ensure that the accounting records are fully in line with the allocation of public affairs. With this approach, the so-called overall planning will have a precise numerical basis. The current registration method for registering inventory of various industries seems to be consistent with the above-mentioned accounting system advocated by this writer, as it uses records of receipt and payment balances. However, judging from the current situation of inventory surveys, inquiries are more common than inspections, which shows that the current method does not seem to have established a controlling permanent inventory system, so that investigators cannot compare the balance of the controlling account of the Control Association with the clear inventory account of various industries, thus greatly reducing the effectiveness of the inspection. In my humble opinion, the Commercial Control Association should raise the authority of the accounting function, establish a special accounting department, and establish a controlling permanent inventory system for various industries under commercial control. Then, with a book in hand, the materials of various industries in the country will be clear at a glance, and no one will dare to be vague.</p>
<p>(3) Implement warehouse management. Hoarding is an obstacle to control, and warehouses are a tool for hoarding. Merchants use warehouses and transfer warehouse receipts for speculative transactions, thereby undermining control. Therefore, to implement control, hoarding must be stopped, and to stop hoarding, warehouse management must be implemented. According to the current registration method, it is also a method of managing inventory, but it is not as strict and effective as implementing warehouse management. In modern economic society, only prices can control everything, and warehouse management is the way to control prices. Being able to control prices means being able to control the economy. For example, the central bank can control finance by raising and lowering interest rates only because it has the most abundant funds. The principle is the same.</p>
<h3>Change of Currency Exchange Unit</h3>
<p>(Beijing, Central News Agency dispatch) According to the announcement of the China United Reserve Bank on the 31st, after the issuance of military notes in Huazhong and South China is abolished from April 1st, the method of exchanging currency carried by travelers traveling between North China and Huazhong and South China will be abolished. The previous system of exchanging units between United Reserve Bank notes and military notes will be changed to exchanging units between United Reserve Bank notes and Central Reserve Bank notes. Travelers holding one ticket per person, including train tickets, ship tickets, and airplane tickets, can exchange 180 yuan in United Reserve Bank notes or 1,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. The exchange rate is 18 yuan in United Reserve Bank notes to 100 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes.</p>
<h3>Commentary: The Financial Industry Should Support Small Industries</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the financial industry and the production industry were discussed. Now, the importance of the financial industry's support for small industries is discussed. Generally, the small industries and handicrafts in our country, either due to insufficient funds or poor management, are small in scope and have not been fully developed. These industries account for the vast majority in our country, and their effectiveness and importance to the economy and society should not be underestimated. According to a survey by the Social Affairs Bureau in the 24th year of the Republic (1935), there were 26,128 shops in Shanghai (excluding the concessions) that also had handicraft characteristics, and 5,874 purely handicraft factories. Although there are no complete statistics now, it is generally increasing. Scattered in various places, such as textiles, bamboo and wood, ceramics, and other categories, the output is also considerable. At a time when materials are scarce today, the promotion of these small industries and handicrafts is imperative.</p>
<p>The financial industry should find a proper outlet here, which is to gradually prosper small-scale industries. The methods for the financial industry to support these industries are: first, financial assistance, such as loans for purchasing materials, loans for production, and loans for transportation and sales. The second is technical assistance, such as factory site selection, equipment allocation, improvement of manufacturing methods, planning of production and sales policies, and all other technical issues. After banks have more contact with these small industries, if they encounter similar natures, it is easy to promote cooperation between them, so that production efficiency will become more and more powerful. Then, the seedlings of today's industries will become a forest in the future, which will be a highlight of our country's industry, all stemming from the support of the financial industry today.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Health Authorities are Actively Preparing for the Summer Epidemic Prevention Campaign, Scheduled to Begin in Mid-Month and to be Completed Within One and a Half Months</h3>
<p>According to the deputy director of the Public Works Department's Health Department, the Health Department will cooperate with the Public Concession's Baojia organizations in mid-April to carry out the summer epidemic prevention and health maintenance campaign.</p>
<p>Urging Residents to Get Vaccinated</p>
<p>It is said that in mid-April, the various branches of the Health Department will be opened to provide residents with general vaccinations. The personnel of various Baojia organizations, especially the members of youth groups, will be assigned to promote the importance of epidemic prevention and urge residents in various districts to apply for vaccinations.</p>
<p>Completion Expected Within One and a Half Months</p>
<p>The implementation of vaccinations will be carried out first in the West Hongkou District, Xinzha District, and Chengdu District, etc., because the population in these areas is relatively large, estimated to be over one million people. It is also predicted that this health work can be completed in about one and a half months. As for other areas with sparse populations, this work will take less than one and a half months.</p>
<p>Conducting Fly and Mosquito Eradication Campaign</p>
<p>The second period for vaccinations will begin around mid-August. Another health plan, the fly and mosquito eradication campaign, will be carried out in cooperation with the public. The Health Department will also implement strict controls on food. Food that is detrimental to hygiene in vegetable markets or on roads will be prohibited from sale.</p>

<h3>Spokesperson of the Japanese Army Department Talks About the Results of the Su-Huai Mopping-Up Campaign</h3>
<p>The spokesperson of the Japanese Army Department's Press Department in Shanghai reported the results of the Su-Huai mopping-up campaign at a reception for Chinese journalists yesterday. He said, "Since the Su-Huai war zone was jointly fought by the Chinese and Japanese armies, significant results have been achieved. When the Japanese army launched an offensive in Su-Huai, its main purpose was to annihilate the 89th Army under Han Deqin and the 8th Brigade of the 3rd Division of the New Fourth Army. Now, there are only a very small number of remaining New Fourth Army troops in Liutanghe near Hongze Lake. The Japanese army continues to mop them up, burying 320 enemy corpses. Han Deqin once asked Gu Zhutong of the Third War Zone in Chongqing for help. Wang Zhonglian's troops, the commander of the Yu-Su-Wan Border Region in Chongqing, provided assistance and infiltrated the Su-Huai area across the Jinpu Line. After being detected by the Japanese army, they immediately dispatched troops to surround more than 2,000 of Wang's troops in Suxian, inflicting heavy losses and burying 370 corpses. Since the start of the mopping-up campaign, they have been in contact with the 7th Brigade of the New Fourth Army in the South Jin of Chaohu Lake, and contact has also occurred at Xiatangji in Huainan. According to the spokesperson, the number of enemy troops recently surrendering and being captured has increased significantly. The reasons are estimated to be: (1) The Chongqing army has now clearly understood Japan's current policy. Since making factual expressions on the return of concessions, the abolition of extraterritorial rights, and the transfer of enemy property, they recognize Japan's sincerity towards our country and realize that blindly fighting only harms the national economy and people's livelihood. (2) After China and Japan cooperated in the joint operation, the sincere cooperation between China and Japan has been demonstrated. At the same time, the peace zone is becoming more and more prosperous and thriving, which is deeply moving. (3) The supply has been cut off and they have fallen into poverty. (4) The political power of the National Government is spreading everywhere, so they are grateful."</p>
