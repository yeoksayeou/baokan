<p>社評</p>
<h3>歲暮反省</h3>
<p>光陰荏苒，歲聿云暮，今天已是三十二年的大除夕了。在這一年的最後一天，是我們反省過去一切的最適當的時間。一年之中，我們已經將隨時見到的，隨時反省指出。今天更概括的反省一下，以作明年努力的方向：</p>
<p>第一，一年之中，個人的努力怎樣，是否已經各自站在崗位上努力。希望每個人作一次切實的反省。我們認為個人方面有兩種不合理，一種是根本不努力，譬如生產者，怠惰荒廢，減低效率；譬如學生，貧懶嬉議，不勤學業。一種是雖知努力，而獨善其身，只圖私利，而不顧公益，譬如投機囤積，百般鑽營，可惜祇為一己謀利，獨善其身，其罪惡且超過不努力者</p>
<p>從今以後，希望每個人注意各自崗位的努力，同時，破除小我利益，顧及大我利益。</p>
<p>第二，一年之中，個人對於社會的貢獻如何？社會領導者對於人民的影響如何？希望每個人以及負社會領導資任者作一次切實的反省。我們感覺不合理的，即以上海為例，如舉辦冬賑，社會人士，除極少數熱心者外，大多數有力量者漠不關心，籌募賑款，歷時月餘，距目標尚遠。可是，冬賑的重要性，一般人非不瞭解，而對此缺少熱忱，於是勸募者不熱心勸募，捐輸者不熱心捐輸，結果使冬賑進行遲滯·叉如戰時節約消費，應一致實行，可是，事實上一般人除因物價高昂的限制，不得不節約以外，很多富有者仍窮奢極侈，不知愛惜物力。</p>
<p>從今以後，希望每個人對於社會事業，熱心贊助。社會領導分子，尤應熱心策進。</p>
<p>第三，一年之中，政府領導的政治經濟等等，是否適應人民要求？是否相亙配合？是否符合大東亞戰爭決戰態勢？希望政府當局作一次切實的反省。政府一切政令政策，最重要的是相互配合，絕不應前後矛盾，彼此衝突。尤其在目前戰時，政策政令之推行，都應與戰時需要相配合。如果背此原則，不但政策政令失其效用，政府失其威信，而於戰時需要，不能配合，其後果更為嚴重。一年以來，政府設施未能適合此原則者，達者不談，即如最近上海靑少年團，對於禁絕烟賭舞之行動一事，可見政府政策的不能配合。靑少年團是政府當局領導組織的，所以，靑少年團的行動，政府當然有責任的。以原則而言，對於禁絕烟賭舞一事，本質上當然是絕對應該的，祇須當地主管政府一紙命令，即可禁絕，可是，政府政策一方面是默許的，而一方面又有靑少年團自由行動，而事後政府復予寬容。我們姑置這事件的本質不論，惟此已為政府政策不相配合的一例了。又如政府政治上倡導戰時增加生產，而在國民經濟實質上反映的卻是生產遞減。同時，中國參戰將近一年，決戰階段日近一日，而政府戰時體制迄未完成，因為人民尚無參政機會，官民協力不能獲得最大效果。</p>
<p>從今以後，希望政府對於政策政令務須相亙配合，尤其配合戰時需要。</p>
<p>「以前種種譬如昨日死，以後種種譬如今日生」，當此除舊佈新之際，我們謹以至誠提出各方面的事例，希望大家切切實實痛加反省，有接受過去「非」的勇氣，才能達到今後「是」的坦途。</p>

<h3>揚子江下游地區　日軍本年戰績　渝方兵力日見衰退</h3>
<p>中央社訊揚子江下游方面，自今歲即國府參戰以來，日陸年諸部隊已回復野戰軍之本來面目，向擊滅敵人而邁進，在二月嚴寒之蘇淮地區，對八十九軍渝軍及新四軍寶施擊減作戰，十一月初對廣機附近掃蕩忠羲救國軍，嗣後並對渝軍共產軍以及其他雜軍不斷展開擊減作戰，其時國府軍隊亦協力日軍作戰，獲得偉大戰績。如將揚子江下游地區日陸軍諸部隊在一年內之戰果作一概觀，可以表示渝方接濟路至今已完全被切斷，渝兵力日見疲退。渝方最近之戰略，在竭方避免與日軍勁旅正面衝突，力謀保存自己兵力，即以浙皖作戰而言，作戰次數較前年增加約六百次，而抗戰兵力卻減少十餘萬，其陣亡人數亦如此。但觀日軍戴獲兵器數在蘇淮作戰中，大批迫擊砲為日軍戴獲，而其他重火器極見減少，尤以截獲步槍之減少尤可證明渝共裝備之日趨惡劣，日方之陣亡人數僅及去年之四成強，為前年之半數，茲將今年內總合戰果誌后：交戰次數約三　·三〇〇次，交戰渝共兵力約五三〇·〇〇〇，渝共軍戰死二八·七九九，俘虜及歸順一五·三二一，截獲迫擊砲一八二，砲彈一三·二二六，高射機關砲四，大砲一一，重實機關槍六二，子彈五入三〇五，戰機關槍三一四，子彈五八·三〇五，輕機關槍三一四，子彈六〇五二六，自動步槍五六，步搶一四·四三入，子彈一·六四四·〇九七，手搶九〇五，擲彈筒入〇，襲彈槍九三，共他兵器被服不計，日方陣亡八二入。</p>
<p>漢口卅日中央社電　日華中軍當局於卅日下午四時發表：（一）日軍為呼應常德作戰特對淪第六第九兩戰區之主力各軍「三十入個師」展開殲減戰，（以）日軍於常德戰役之開始時對正面蠢動之渝軍完成進擊態勢，於　水河畔殲滅渝軍七十三軍迫常德瀕於危殆，淪軍第五第九兩戰區為牽制日軍，自十二月中旬會於信陽前門宜北及粵漢綫各地活動，試行反攻，日軍出於先機，將其取土粉碎，十二月中旬以來將渝軍全數封銀對於攻略常德有奠大二月中旬以來將渝軍全數封鎖對於攻略常德有莫大審興，茲誌各警備戰綜合戰果如次：渝軍乘屍六三六九，被俘及投誠者六四三，又鹵獲大砲四門，重輕機槍六九挺，步槍六三一支。</p>
<h3>第二方面軍　一年來戰果</h3>
<p>開封三十日中央社電　第二方面軍總司令部於孫良誠將軍督導下展開各地區之淸剿工作，一年來該軍所獲綜合戰果甚大，茲錄於次：（一）交戰次數共一二八次，（二）匪共出動兵力總計八萬四千五百餘人，（三）匪共傷亡（九〇八七人）（四）俘獲匪共五七七入，（五）鹵獲輕機槍十七挺，迫擊砲二門，步槍七一八支，輕機槍五十一支，手溜彈八五三枚，子彈四八五七粒，馬七四匹，及其他軍需品甚夥。</p>
<h3>渝機十八架　被日機擊落</h3>

<h3>「一年戰時外交　回顧與前瞻」　日井口部長廣播演講</h3>
<p>東京三十日中央社電　日情報局井口第三部長，二十九日下午七時二十分，假此間電合廣播，題為「一年間戰時外交之回顧與前瞻」，要官如次：戰爭乃軍事，政治，外交，經濟，思想等併行之戰爭，綜觀此等方面，絕非敵方出以攻勢，我方採取防禦，無寗謂我軍方正逐漸加緊進攻中，特別在政治外交方面，昭和十八年實即我國進攻最烈之年，蓋以言我國戰爭且的，所謂驅英美勢力於東亞之外者，實不過其前提條件而已。如年初對華新政策之樹立，八月之緬甸獨立，十月之菲律賓獨立，以及印度納西亞原住民之參政，泰國合併廣大領土等事實，我政府乘認自由印度臨時政府，聲明準備將尼科巴，安達曼兩羣島劃歸該政府，更予其國民軍以強力援助等事，無不為日政府援助亞洲各民族，恢復其自由獨立之道義外交之表現。同時亦為對英美之有力政治攻勢，迄十一月，此攻勢已獲得一偉大成果，此乃大東亞會議也。大東亞戰爭爆發以來，英美因速戰述敗，進退失策，乃不得不變更其計劃，迄最近，敵人之狼狽焦慮情形已愈顯著，彼等醒悟長期戰對共不利，後乃一變其主張，而趨向速戰速決，故雖於屢敗之餘，仍不斷其執拗之反攻。英美之指導者，前對渝方之求援，始終未予以實地之援助，然大東亞宣言一出，則已俄然失措，痛感有籠絡渝方之必要，是有日前之開羅會談，決議論日木為三等國，以買歡渝方，繼之復以德黑闌會議，虛張聲勢，更集大軍於太平洋方面，以備一錄壓倒日軍，出以強襲戰法，換得波根維爾島之慘敗。凡此無不為英美之焦慮表現，固為識者所共賭者也。又可稱為擺斯福參謀之霍浦金曾謂，此次大戰終了後，美國將擁有支配世界之海軍與商船隊，擁有世界無一此之空軍而成為最富國，英數額在戰後數年間，將年達七十億元云云，此極狂言足可代表美國之貪婪無盡之戰爭目的。與此美國之支配榨取相對照，而英國之帝國主義戰爭目的，亦已由南非首相史末資在倫敦之濱講中說明，史末資謂：負維持戰後世界之責任者為英美蘇三國，因歐洲新出現一巨人蘇聯，為維持均衡計，英國必置西歐各國於其指導之下，此不但可牽制蘇聯，亦可確保英國在歐洲大陸之地位，以此而謀維持所謂大英帝國之存在，吾人觀彼等此種表現，當可知彼等之戰爭目的，乃在謀建設或保全美帝國的地位。日本於大東亞戰爭第一年，已以軍事之大攻勢確保廣大無盡之資源，完成必勝之態勢，戰爭之第二年，復以政治之攻勢，確立政治，輕濟，文化等方面之鞏固基礎，昭和十入年之歷史的意義，亦即在此。如此轉入戰爭第三年，日本即將以此必勝不敗之態勢為根據，轉作全面之進攻，於軍事方面擊破敵人之反攻，同時更於政治，經濟，文化等方面，使東亞民族打成一體向前推進，謀各民族相互間之應援協力之加緊密進，而由亞洲完全飛出英美企圖制轟世界之勢力，故本年可謂為吾人完成光榮任務之一年。</p>

<h3>歐洲大陸保衛戰德確信勝算在握　美軍在英本土作登陸演習</h3>
<p>柏林三十日中央三十日電　柏林金融報載述敵方評論，以「進攻之危險」為標題，英人有理由相信致勝之牌，傒在德守軍手中，德人將使侵略歐陸之戰事，感為最複雜，困難，及危險之作戰關於英軍對此次作戰之貢獻，仍採取於可能範圍內，極力節省人力之辦法，而使他人為彼作戰。德人已證明不能自空中被擊敗，而在陸地上被擊潰之可能性更覺渺小，故德軍於鎭靜中，以等待由蘇聯所主動之進攻，德人均確信登睦之戰將成反軸心軍之大敗而退。</p>
<p>瑞典京城三十日中央社電　據海通社訊，倫敦官方宣稱：美國駐在英國之軍隊，現正在英格籣荒僻之沿海舉行大規模之進攻演習，登陸部隊抉以大砲及坦克車與岸上守軍進行假想戰，登陸部隊並在軍艦與飛機協助之下，企圖在岸上設立據頭堡，沿海數處城市會元撤空，以備艾森　華軍蒙表演進攻演習。</p>
<p>侵歐龐大計劃經三巨頭贊同</p>
<p>瑙典京城三十日中央社電　據海通社訊，倫敦消息：英國半官通訊設特派員宣稱艾森霍華將軍與合特空軍上將，在舉行德黑蘭與開羅會議之前，即已擬就進攻西歐之龐大計劃。開羅會議開始時，艾合二氏即秘密飛往埃京，向軍事會議提出其攻歐計劃，反軸心國軍事將領即認為此項計劃，具有個值，後遂由邱有爾與羅斯福機往德黑　，與斯達林商討，因此艾森霍華與合特遂獲被舉為進攻西歐之主將。當羅邱二氏前往德黑蘭時，艾合二氏更將其所擬就詳細之計劃，亦獲斯達林莫洛托央伏羅希洛夫諸氏之贊同，故德黑籣會議，在四日內即能決定此事</p>

<p>柏林三十日中央社電　德國新開社訊：德宜傳部長郭培爾與於「德意志週刊」發表論交，暢論一年來反軸心國對德作戰於軍政兩方均歸失敗之逆境。以德人比諸警察，而以流氓視英美人並謂　重不可因流氓之惡已而退縮不前。郭氏於結論中勗勉德人力戰獲勝，俾得轉弱為強，為後代造福。茲譯該文如下：一九四三年為吾人之試驗年，此一年中，德之任務為保持前此大攻勢中所獲得之經濟及軍事地位，此項地位與德之安全息息相關，且為將來最後勝利之先決條件，故預料敵人拚死而奪取該項地位，但敵人並無成就。敵人雖會力攻，但未動搖戰局之根本。郭氏繼回憶年來敵方所宣布之目的，謂倫敦及華盛頓亦承認未能達到其目的，由此觀之，吾人可對一九四三年之戰局表示滿意，敵人對一九四三年之軍事情勞既發生錯覺，其對政治發展亦不免鼠目寸光之識。敵不常預言德將遭遇精神之巖潰乎，然則結果如何，德人於担負第五年大戰重任之今日，仍如前決心作戰獲勝，且其決心從未有如今日之強者，此事并無須樂觀者始能洞悉。反之英美則誇大宣傳，幷已在世界大部份製造空氣，猶如彼等之勝利已為既成事實，且不值再加以討論者，尤以戰爭罪人一章為彼等津津樂道者。郭氏謂敵人已於此戰中，對人道文化以及學術犯各種罪行，敵人曾使千萬人死於饑餓，務使其保持政治之中立，並屠殺婦孺使其男子親屬對作戰無勇氣，且視歐陸二千年來之文化建築物為郵政寰片而炸毀之，所謂戰爭罪人者，實為誰敵人乎，抑吾人乎。與財閥團暨共黨作戰之幼年德意志，乃全世界文化之發言人，吾人當完成吾人之歷史任務，否則人道至義將趨沒落。吾人之責任誠不可以言語形容者，蓋此戰非導常之戰，乃全世界對人類社會之敵人作戰，其存亡在吾人此舉，敵人欲以卑微手段及殘忍戰爭行為使吾人沮喪，但一年以來已證明其將失敗。在上蒼必佑吾人之信念下，吾人已開始迎神秘之來年，此年將為危險年，人類將更趨近劫難，千萬德軍於此歲末舉槍而振作其精神，千萬德農民及工人忙於鐮鎚之工作，更有其千萬母子至成其美，此為今日之德意志，吾人之前代將一弱而曾受辱之德意志交付吾人，但吾人將以一強而大之德意志交付吾人之後代，此為吾人於此次戰爭中爭取勝利之目的，而於每一新年中將有事為之證明也</p>

<h3>柯洛斯頓血戰　德轉移陣地　上聶伯戰事達最高峯</h3>
<p>柏林卅日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：德軍高級指揮部本日發表：德軍在基洛伏格勒之北攻擊，於星期三又獲進展，齊托密爾地區仍在激戰中，雙方皆增援加緊作戰，該處共擊毀蘇坦克車七十二輛。柯洛斯頓鎭於經血戰之後業巳撤退。維特勃斯克附近蘇軍再圖突破，又未得逞。德軍重砲隊曾轟繫列寗格勒之軍事目標極有效果。</p>
<p>柏林卅日中央社電　海通社訊：蘇軍在基輔齊托密爾區及維特勃斯克區兩處發動之冬季大攻勢，猛烈性至今未減，蘇司令部或將擴大其攻勢，或則將發動牽制攻勢，以東縛德後備軍之調遺。蘇將伐吐丁於星期二繼續在柯洛斯頓齊托密爾·貝迪契夫集中進攻，其規模之大為前所未見。敵軍對柯洛斯頓之壓力雖見增加，但其重心仍在南翼，該翼蘇軍自向貝迪契夫進攻被阻後，正自法斯托夫向貝拉耶察爾科夫移動。維勃斯克之戰，正值最高峯，惟壓力與反壓力已約相等，而城之西北通至波落茨克鐵路附近，德軍反攻殊為順利。</p>

<h3>義東岸英軍　北進遭遏阻　西部美軍向東北展開</h3>
<p>柏林三十日中決社電　海通社訊：蒙高戊萊將軍之先鋒，在奧爾托納方面，進攻德軍陣地已受阻礙，英軍於德軍退出該城後，企　直願貝斯卡拉之希望，業已變成泡影矣。英軍沿亞特里亞海岸推進，因德軍仍控制瑪傑拉而受影響，英向貝斯卡拉進展，將受更大之阻得。蒙高茂萊將軍或將以瑪傑拉以南之左翼發動攻勢，並以中路大軍協力進攻，目前奧索格那與迦里格萊爾方面，英軍已增加壓力。亞平寗方面，仍在激戰中，美第五軍之陣地似已向東北展開、英第入軍扼守之左翼維森托，阿爾菲台那方面，已發現美軍，卡伐拉由德軍主要陣綫無甚變化，西面之美軍仍進攻各處高地，自米納諾通往卡西諾之公路以北反軸心軍已增加墜力，蓋塔灣之美第五軍左翼仍不甚活動</p>
<h3>英美兩國對　巴爾幹的政治攻勢</h3>
<p>瑞士各報的外國特派員最近常報告保加利亞的情勢，其內容大抵是關於對保國派遺增援部隊，在本月人日舉行的保政府秘密緊急閣議，最近數日間特別頻繁的蘇斐亞莫斯科之間的外交交涉等。德國當局否定增派部隊說，保政府也明白否定開行秘密閣議，但開羅，德里蘭二次會談後，英美對巴爾幹開始活潑的政治攻勢，毫無疑義的餘地。</p>
<p>英美進行政治工作</p>
<p>邱吉爾在開羅專事政治工作，九日會見前希臘國王奇奧爾其奧斯，十日會見前南斯拉夫國王彼得。又在英美空軍竟然盲炸蘇斐亞，美國務卿赫爾並對德國盟邦波羅的海三國實行恫嚇，這樣，保國現在似乎正在成為中心目標。但這種政治工作，因保國軍隊指導層根據傳統的親德能度，始終忠實地進守德保協定，故不會有何意義。對於英美的巴爾幹工作，蘇聯利用下列之點，一民族的特別關係，而，對保國內外的地方工作，三，和保國的中立關係，使保國成為自己的藩屏。因此，問題愈趨糾紛，在英美方面看來，巴爾幹問題依然包合訐多難關。</p>
<p>在英美方面，無論從當前的戰略來看也好，從將來的大計夾看也好，這巴爾幹問題實為最緊急且具體的問題。假使英要蘇在德黑蘭會談中會達到某種協定，則關於巴爾幹的第二戰綫問題，一定有所妥協。據某美國士官談，史　林抓住會談中所有機　，強調紅軍戰死者達八百萬人。從這事實推測，關於戰後問題，史太林擬阻止英美的提案，堅持說戰爭尚未告終，所以還不是討論戰後問題的時期。對於基本問題，似不容英美討論及之。</p>
<p>蘇聯要求第一戰綫</p>
<p>如其這推論不　，則會談的內容當然隈於當前的軍事問題，而第二戰綫顯然為其對象。如從蘇聯的見地，第二戰錢問題最近己多少改變其傾向，蘇聯的要求依然在於對德國西部要塞綫的眞正的第二戰線，假使英美今年也忙於開關第二戰線，則英美不能不覺悟喪失巴爾幹的可能性。英美以為進攻巴爾幹是最便利的作戰，因為英美在難部義大利已有基地，英第九第十軍及其他兵力已在開羅，敘利亞地區待機。但從政治上看，英美軍進攻巴爾幹的錢途，難關重重。第一，因保國的存在。保國對全不同。第二，因南斯拉夫的存在。這是極難於處理的間題。蓋南國現有奇特及亡命開羅的二個政權，英國政府現正立於決定對南國亡命政權政策的歧路上。</p>
<p>據標準晚報的消息，奇特派遣使節團謁南國國王彼得二携有妥協案，以罷免國防部長密哈洛維區為條件，迎國王為南國解放軍的總帥。以前常攻鑒國王彼得的每日勢　報，最近亦改變論調；　晤士報似支持奇特政權，再度勸吿國王彼得容納妥協案。這些　實，晤示以南國為中心的某種政治工作的進展。如其蘇職在英美的巴爾幹問題上作若干讓步，則蘇聯將要求應在西歐開闢眞正的第二戰綫為其前提。同時主張巴爾幹攻勢不能不取和蘇　共司作戰的形態。</p>
<p>蘇聯有意共同作戰</p>
<p>據倫敦情報，蘇聯有意擔任共同作戰的一翼，沿黑海岸南進，因而這種共同作戰是可能的，然而英美即使能把持韃　尼爾海峽，拉攏土耳其作為友好的中立國，但要經過土耳其進攻巴爾幹，頗為困難。軍事專門家確信德方可以確保韃　尼爾海峽。所以蘇聯軍的沿黑海進擊及同時眞正的進攻巴爾幹，將渺不可期。可是英國各報卻揣測土耳其的態度，稱巴爾幹即將發生某種非常重大的事情。連務晤士報也以這種印象給與讀者。蓋從土耳其領土內出擊，開始空襲巴爾幹也不能不說「即將發生的大事」。尤以德黑關會談限於討論軍事問題的事實看來，美美似乎被強迫從事最不願意的大規模戰役，假使他們希望從德黑蘭會議談中要獲得愉快的成果，則他們的企圖不能不視為完全被推翻。最近洛續舉行的莫斯科，開羅，德黑　會談，猶似被黑雲遮掩的謎，在那黑雲的被後者是英美方面宣傳的，「歐洲和平說」，德黑蘭，開羅會談的結果，暴露了黑雲背後的眞正的情勢，英美的戰略和企圖，由此全盤被托出了。（翔：譯自十二月十七日西部朝日新聞</p>

<h3>粉廠用電　規定限制辦法　粉麥委會與華中水電商妥</h3>
<p>中央社訊　商統會粉麥專業委員會，與華中水電公司商妥，所屬製粉廠需用電力之規定，由粉麥專業委員會負負實施，茲將雙方協定用電情形錄下：</p>
<p>所需電力應予規定</p>
<p>關於製粉工業用電華中水電與粉麥專業委員會會同硏究結果，認為對於節減全製粉工廠所需電力之　，應由粉麥專業委員會擔負，故對其需要之電力，應由會予以規定。至於實行方法，則擬先行核減現在列於統制圈外而以黑市價格收買小麥製成麵粉後，擅向黑市售出之磨坊，及其他小型粉廠所需之電力，使其按四折或三折計算用電，並擬依　前經國府核准之磨坊及其他小型粉廠管理暫行辦法，使全部製粉工廠　受此則向來售出於黑市之麵粉，即能充作正常配給之用，則預計其生產量當可增加一成半。</p>
<p>指導粉廠趨於合理</p>
<p>又查麵粉一袋所需電力，最髙需三·五基羅瓦特，最低需一·五基羅瓦特，按照所費電力，並可推究設備之優劣如何，工廠管理之巧拙如何。粉麥專業委員會為顧及麵粉生產不受影響，並收節省電力之功效起見，擬指導所屬各製粉工廠，使用電力趨於合理化，並對於節電有優秀成績之工廠，增加配給原麥數量，以示鼓勵。關於目前之措施，粉麥專業委員會擬將所管各工廠次月份之麵粉生產量及所需電力數量，由各工廠佈吿後，即據以通知華中水電公司供給電力，是以此次限制電力，非但不阻碍麵粉生產，而確能保持成本低廉生產增加，對推進統制工作，貢獻實多，華中水電公司已贊成將各製粉工廠之電力使用數量，每月通知粉麥專業委員會，以示全面協助，防止麵粉流入黑市。</p>

<p>今日為銀錢各業總結束期，銀行業聯合準備會及錢　聯合準備庫早經預備對於行莊之拆放，竭力于以通　，惟須限於各行莊正當用途，而此次中　當局復於總結束期問，儘量調劑，藉資活動頭寸，因此今年年終之際，市面銀根之緊，不若往年之甚，而各業，除少數以投　為營業者，均得安渡年關，實為戰時調度金融得宜的一個明證，堪為我們經濟界人士所欣慰的。</p>
<p>聞一二日來少數行莊及公司商號以投　為營業者，因已無法掙扎，均將結東營業；我們所希冀者，就是本市各種畸形投機交易的一部份，由於年終的自滅，爾後即永無死灰復燃的機會，而防微杜漸的責任，則仍在於我們金融界；這種實任是十二分重大的，因為一年來人民生活之不能安定，其直接原因即由於一切投機營業之刺激物價狂　；我們曾經說過：從通貨金融方面來限制物價之被擾亂，終不失為「斧底抽薪」的一個物價政策。所以，今後必須格外注意銀行貸出之管理，使經營一切不正當營業的資本，從此無由獲致，那末，整個的生產事業，方有光明的前途。</p>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪羊譯</p>
<p>靑春（七）</p>
<p>菊池陸軍少佐，在偽人的學校裏，不過當了三年的敎師，可是給與他的感化却極大。少佐是熊本縣人，那時候已經四十多歲了。但因身軀結實，口髭濃密，所以看起來總是精神抖擻地很年靑似的。因有胃氣的老毛病，轉任配屬將校，本來是應當配在野戰中喊號令的武人。志行堅定，行動奇特，對任何人不作客套。祗有他，有時也當面責備剛毅的河田校長。</p>
<p>「你似乎太傲慢了。俗語也說，入鄕隨鄕呢」。</p>
<p>「不，我的主義是入鄕鄕隨我」。</p>
<p>因為這種皮氣，所以到任匆匆，就不顧一切的，開始改革學生風氣運動。在校內發起喇叭部，射擊部，吟詩部，國防恤兵會等，他自已以為對的就做下去。別人的批評，是毫不介意的。關於菊池少佐的自信力，現在還　留着下面一段話柄：</p>
<p>那是在高橋三吉大將，率領艦隊，進入鹿兒島灣的時候。菊池少佐對河田校長說：「恰是好機會，請高橋司令長官　話吧！請把學生們聚集到運動塲來」。</p>
<p>「那很好。巳經得了大將的應允嗎」？校長懷疑地問着。</p>
<p>「不，還沒有」。</p>
<p>「那你大胡鬧了」。</p>
<p>「不用管，請把學生聚集到運動塲來就得　」</p>
<p>「不等回言，少佐就跑出校門，在路上僱了一輛汽車。一小時後，高橋大將就出現在運動塲內設下的演講壇上。</p>
<p>「眞是太匆忙了，一時說不出什麽有系統的話來。……」大將嘻嘻地笑着，開始了訓話</p>
<p>雖然這樣，菊池少佐也很容易感動人的。把不及格的壞學生，憐惜地呌到自己家裏。少佐祗吩咐他早起。從第二天早晨上起，他在少佐家裏用朝飯，再到學校去。不到一月，壞學生便好像換了一個人似的，不用担心不及格了</p>
<p>「斷而行之，鬼神避之」。這是菊池少佐的口頭禪。是他的信條。眞人的腦海中，深深地記住了這話，雖在九年之後，也沒有忘記。</p>
<h3>上海流民習勤所　工作概况</h3>
<p>丙　技能訓練　流民入所之後，旣重習勤生產，使有自力更生之精神，出所之後，可作社會之良民，故該會對於勞役及增長流民技能部份，依照議定計劃，感化敎育與職業敎育並重，並特組工藝推進委員會，策動各種技術訓練，並聘用技師，專司傳習其訓練，科目如左：　園藝　作物　畜牧　針織　草織　縫紉　鞋工　木工　竹工　洗染　　食品製作（製作麺包及烹調等）　　其他</p>
<p>丁　基本知識訓練　該所流民具有學歷技能固不乏人，然不甚識字與缺乏技能者實居多數，基本知識之訓練，實為當前之急務，該所利用飯堂為講堂，規定時間，舉行成人兒童敎育班，推行此種訓練，規定科目如左：　識字　習字　珠筆算（簡單簿記）　常識（社會自然）　其他</p>
<p>以上各科除由訓育組委員會派定敎師專任訓育外，並擇流民中學歷優良者佐理其事，其書籍筆墨及各項用品均由所發給。</p>
<p>戊　生活指導　大衆生活重在紀律流民勞息有定規，起居有準時，而信條之遵守，願詞之奉行，每日由所長及各區長隨時指導推進，並規定考績獎懲條例，以為督導之標準，其推行之條目如左：　各項生活須知，　各工塲所公約，　區自治訓練，　其他。</p>
<p>五習勤推動</p>
<p>該會為推動流民習勤生產起見，特分所民為三區，以資管理，一曰特別區，二曰農　區，三曰工藝區茲將各區工作報吿如后：</p>
<p>甲　特別區　流民入所後，先由本區施以感化，並各就所能加以訓練，然後分撥農藝工藝兩區工作，如在農工兩區不能恪守規則或有怠工情事，仍送交本區重施感化，期於澈底變換其心理而後已，開辦以來，除實施各種生活指導外，並勵行區自治訓練，以啓發其互助互愛之精神，仍不時分派臨時工作，以　磨練云。</p>
<p>乙　農藝區　本區分設園藝作物畜牧三科，同時推進。園藝科　本科自七月間開始，經選派熟習園藝者數十人，就所內空地開墾二十餘畝，按時播種各項菜蔬數十種，七八兩月收獲僅能供助本所一部分之用，九月份收獲達三千餘元，現正力圖逐步擴充，將來收獲當可日有增益云。</p>
<p>丙　工藝區　本區分設草縫紉針織木工四科，開辦以來，已略具雛形。</p>
<p>六經費槪况　該所經費前經各市區當局會同該會議定預算草案為國幣四百十九萬一千八百二十元由上海特別市政府分任一百萬元，工部局（第一區）分任一百五十萬元，法公　局（第八區）分任七十五萬元，該會分任九十四萬一千八百二十元，此為三十一年冬月間事，旋以物價飛漲靡已，即以開辦費一項而言，按照原定預算已超出一百三十五萬六千餘元，經常費用按開辦後之五六七八九十六個月中，支付已在三百五十三萬餘元，以全年計之約須七百餘萬元，當時以超出預算過鉅，祗得由該會儘量設法募助，以資應付，為數已在百餘萬元，際茲米價日見飛騰各物步漲則三十三年度所需經費，必繼長增高也。現在雖承市區當局捐助鉅款而本會分認款數亦已屆一百餘萬元以上，値此物價高漲超出預算原額甚鉅，在此心餘力絀之際，尙祈各界仁人善士予以協　，宏慈善舉，造福流民，實匪淺鮮也。（完）</p>

        <h1>1943.12.31</h1>
<h3>Year-End Introspection</h3>
<p>Time flies, and the year is coming to an end. Today is the eve of the thirty-second year [of the Republic]. On this last day of the year, it is the most appropriate time for us to reflect on everything that has passed. Throughout the year, we have pointed out and reflected on things as we saw them. Today, let's reflect in a more comprehensive way to provide direction for our efforts in the coming year:</p>
<p>First, how have individuals worked this year? Have they each been working hard in their respective positions? We hope that everyone will conduct a thorough self-reflection. We believe there are two types of unreasonableness on the individual level. One is a fundamental lack of effort. For example, producers who are lazy and neglectful, reducing efficiency; or students who are idle and playful, not diligent in their studies. The other is knowing to work hard, but only for personal gain, disregarding public interest. For example, engaging in speculation and hoarding, and various manipulations. It is regrettable that they only seek personal benefit and self-interest, and their sin is even greater than those who do not make an effort.</p>
<p>From now on, we hope that everyone will pay attention to their efforts in their respective positions. At the same time, break away from the interests of the small self and consider the interests of the greater self.</p>
<p>Second, what contributions have individuals made to society this year? What influence have social leaders had on the people? We hope that every individual and those responsible for social leadership will conduct a thorough self-reflection. What we feel is unreasonable is, taking Shanghai as an example, when holding a winter relief effort, social figures, except for a very few enthusiastic individuals, most of those with power are indifferent. Fundraising for relief has lasted for more than a month, and is still far from the target. However, the importance of winter relief is generally understood, but there is a lack of enthusiasm for it. As a result, those who solicit donations are not enthusiastic in their solicitation, and those who donate are not enthusiastic in their donations, which results in the slow progress of the winter relief. Moreover, wartime austerity in consumption should be universally implemented, but in fact, apart from the restrictions imposed by high prices, many wealthy people are still extremely extravagant, not knowing how to cherish material resources.</p>
<p>From now on, we hope that everyone will enthusiastically support social undertakings. Social leaders, in particular, should enthusiastically promote them.</p>
<p>Third, have the political and economic leadership of the government, etc., met the needs of the people this year? Do they coordinate with each other? Do they conform to the decisive battle posture of the Greater East Asia War? We hope that the government authorities will conduct a thorough self-reflection. The most important thing for all government policies and decrees is to coordinate with each other, and they should never be contradictory or conflicting. Especially in the current wartime, the implementation of policies and decrees should be in line with wartime needs. If this principle is violated, not only will the policies and decrees lose their effectiveness, and the government will lose its credibility, but also, it cannot cooperate with wartime needs, and the consequences will be even more serious. In the past year, there have been government measures that have failed to meet this principle. Not to mention the obvious, but as with the recent Shanghai Youth League's actions to ban smoking, gambling, and dancing, it can be seen that government policies are not coordinated. The Youth League is an organization led and organized by the government authorities, so the government is of course responsible for the actions of the Youth League. In principle, banning smoking, gambling, and dancing is, in essence, absolutely correct, and can be banned with just an order from the local government in charge. However, government policy on the one hand tacitly approves of it, while on the other hand, the Youth League is free to act, and afterwards the government is lenient. We will not discuss the nature of this incident for the time being, but this is already an example of the government's policies not being coordinated. For example, the government politically advocates increased production during wartime, but in the reality of the national economy, what is reflected is a decrease in production. At the same time, China has been participating in the war for nearly a year, and the decisive stage is approaching day by day, but the government's wartime system has not yet been completed, because the people still have no opportunity to participate in politics, and the cooperation between officials and the people cannot achieve the greatest effect.</p>
<p>From now on, we hope that the government will ensure that policies and decrees are coordinated with each other, especially to meet wartime needs.</p>
<p>"All past things are as if they died yesterday, all future things are as if they were born today." As we bid farewell to the old and welcome the new, we respectfully offer examples from all aspects, hoping that everyone will earnestly and thoroughly reflect on them, and have the courage to accept the "wrongs" of the past, so that we can reach the smooth path of the "rights" in the future.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army's War Achievements in the Lower Yangtze River Region This Year: Chongqing's Military Strength Declines Daily.</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) In the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, since the National Government's participation in the war this year, the various units of the Japanese Army have reverted to their original form as field armies, advancing to destroy the enemy. In the cold regions of Suhuai in February, they launched strike and reduction operations against the 89th Army of the Chongqing Army and the New Fourth Army. At the beginning of November, they swept through the Chung-Hsi National Salvation Army near Guangde. Afterwards, they continuously launched strike and reduction operations against the Chongqing Army, the Communist Army, and other miscellaneous forces. At that time, the National Government's troops also cooperated with the Japanese Army in combat, achieving great results. Taking an overview of the war results of the various units of the Japanese Army in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River within a year, it can be said that Chongqing's supply routes have now been completely cut off, and Chongqing's military strength is declining daily. Chongqing's recent strategy is to try its best to avoid direct conflict with the elite Japanese forces, and strive to preserve its own military strength. Taking the Zhejiang-Anhui campaign as an example, the number of battles has increased by about 600 times compared to the previous year, while the anti-Japanese military strength has decreased by more than 100,000, and the number of casualties is the same. However, judging from the number of weapons seized by the Japanese army, a large number of mortars were seized by the Japanese army in the Suhuai campaign, while other heavy firearms were greatly reduced, especially the reduction in the number of rifles seized, which can prove the increasingly deteriorated equipment of the Chongqing Communist forces. The number of Japanese casualties is only 40% of last year's, and half of the previous year's. The total war results within this year are recorded as follows: Number of engagements: approximately 3,300 times. Chongqing Communist military strength engaged: approximately 530,000. Chongqing Communist military deaths: 28,799. Captures and surrenders: 15,321. Seized: 182 mortars, 13,226 shells, 4 anti-aircraft machine guns, 11 artillery pieces, 62 heavy machine guns, 58,305 bullets, 314 light machine guns, 60,526 bullets, 56 automatic rifles, 14,438 rifles, 1,644,097 bullets, 905 handguns, 80 grenade launchers, 93 grenade rifles, and other weapons and clothing not included. Japanese casualties: 82.</p>
<p>Hankou, 30th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Central China Army authorities announced at 4 pm on the 30th: (1) In response to the Battle of Changde, the Japanese army launched a war of annihilation against the main forces of the Sixth and Ninth War Zones, "30 divisions." (2) At the beginning of the Battle of Changde, the Japanese army completed its offensive posture against the Chongqing army moving in front, annihilating the 73rd Army of the Chongqing army on the banks of the Lishui River, bringing Changde to the brink of crisis. In order to contain the Japanese army, the Fifth and Ninth War Zones of the Chongqing army have been active in Xinyang, Qianmen, Yibei, and various places along the Yuehan Line since mid-December, attempting a counteroffensive. The Japanese army took the initiative and crushed them. Since mid-December, the entire Chongqing army has been sealed off, which has greatly promoted the capture of Changde. The comprehensive war results of the various garrison battles are as follows: Chongqing military corpses: 6,369. Captured and surrendered: 643. Also seized: 4 artillery pieces, 69 heavy and light machine guns, and 631 rifles.</p>
<h3>Achievements of the Second Front Army in the Past Year.</h3>
<p>Kaifeng, 30th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Under the supervision of General Sun Liangcheng, the Second Front Army Headquarters launched clearing operations in various areas. The comprehensive results achieved by the army in the past year are substantial, and are recorded as follows: (1) Number of engagements: a total of 128 times. (2) Total number of Communist bandits mobilized: more than 84,500 people. (3) Communist bandit casualties: (9,087 people). (4) Communist bandits captured: 577 people. (5) Seized: 17 light machine guns, 2 mortars, 718 rifles, 51 light machine guns, 853 hand grenades, 4,857 bullets, 74 horses, and a large amount of other military supplies.</p>
<h3>Eighteen Chongqing Planes Shot Down by Japanese Planes</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a telegram from a certain base of the Japanese Army in Central China, the Japanese Army planes bombed the Chongqing airport in Suichuan, Jiangxi, on the 27th, and shot down 18 Chongqing planes. The Japanese aircraft fighter-bomber joint large formation arrived over Yun-Chuan at 2 pm on the same day, and engaged in a fierce air battle with more than 20 Chongqing aircraft that intercepted them.

<h3>"Review and Outlook on One Year of Wartime Diplomacy": Broadcast Speech by Japanese Minister Iguchi</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese Information Bureau Director-General Iguchi gave a broadcast speech entitled "Review and Outlook on One Year of Wartime Diplomacy" at 7:20 pm on the 29th, the main points of which are as follows: War is a war of military, political, diplomatic, economic, and ideological forces working in parallel. Looking at these aspects comprehensively, it is by no means that the enemy is launching an offensive while we are adopting a defensive posture. There is no reason to say that our military is gradually intensifying its offensive. In particular, in the political and diplomatic aspects, the 18th year of Showa [1943] was actually the year in which our country launched the most intense offensive. In other words, our country's war objective, which is to drive the British and American forces out of East Asia, is only a prerequisite. For example, the establishment of the new China policy at the beginning of the year, the independence of Burma in August, the independence of the Philippines in October, the participation of native Indonesians in politics, and the annexation of vast territories by Thailand are all facts. Our government has recognized the Provisional Government of Free India, and has stated that it is preparing to transfer the Nicobar and Andaman Islands to that government. Furthermore, it has given strong assistance to its national army. All of these are expressions of the Japanese government's moral diplomacy of assisting Asian nations to restore their freedom and independence. At the same time, it is also a powerful political offensive against Britain and the United States. By November, this offensive had achieved a great result, which was the Greater East Asia Conference. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Britain and the United States have been unable to change their plans due to their desire for a quick victory and their missteps. Until recently, the enemy's embarrassment and anxiety have become more and more obvious. They have realized that a long-term war is unfavorable to them, and have changed their position to aim for a quick victory. Therefore, despite repeated defeats, they continue their stubborn counterattacks. The leaders of Britain and the United States have never given practical assistance to Chongqing's requests for help. However, when the Greater East Asia Declaration was issued, they were suddenly at a loss and felt the need to win over Chongqing. Therefore, there was the Cairo Conference the other day, which decided to discuss designating Japan as a third-rate country in order to please Chongqing. Following this was the Tehran Conference, which made a false show of strength, and gathered a large army in the Pacific to prepare for a crushing blow against the Japanese army, launching a strong attack. This was exchanged for the disastrous defeat on Bougainville Island. All of these are manifestations of the anxiety of Britain and the United States, which is evident to all who are aware of the situation. Also, Hopkins, a staff member of Byrnes, once said that after the end of this war, the United States will have the world's largest navy and merchant fleet, have the world's unparalleled air force, and become the richest country. He said that British numbers will reach 7 billion yuan per year in the years after the war. This extremely arrogant statement can represent the United States' insatiable war aims. In contrast to the United States' domination and exploitation, the war aims of British imperialism have also been explained by South African Prime Minister Smuts in his speech in London. Smuts said: The responsibility for maintaining the post-war world rests with the three countries of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Because a new giant, the Soviet Union, has appeared in Europe, in order to maintain the balance, Britain must place the countries of Western Europe under its leadership. This will not only contain the Soviet Union, but also ensure Britain's position in the European continent. This is to seek to maintain the existence of the so-called British Empire. When we observe their performance, we should know that their war aim is to seek to build or preserve the position of the American Empire. In the first year of the Greater East Asia War, Japan secured vast and inexhaustible resources with a major military offensive, and completed a posture of certain victory. In the second year of the war, it strengthened its political offensive and established a solid foundation in the political, economic, and cultural fields. This is also the historical significance of the 18th year of Showa [1943]. As we enter the third year of the war, Japan will base itself on this state of certain victory and invincibility, and make a comprehensive offensive, defeating the enemy's counteroffensive in the military field. At the same time, in the political, economic, and cultural fields, it will unite the East Asian nations and move forward, seeking to strengthen the mutual support and cooperation between the various nations, and completely remove the forces of Britain and the United States that attempt to control the world from Asia. Therefore, this year can be said to be the year in which we complete our glorious mission.</p>

<h3>Germany Confident of Winning European Continental Defense. US Troops Conduct Landing Exercises on British Soil.</h3>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Berlin Financial News reported an enemy commentary, titled "The Danger of Invasion," stating that the British have reason to believe that the winning card is in the hands of the German defenders. The Germans will make the invasion of the European continent the most complex, difficult, and dangerous operation. Regarding the British contribution to this operation, they are still taking the approach of saving manpower as much as possible within the possible range, and letting others fight for them. The Germans have proven that they cannot be defeated from the air, and the possibility of being defeated on land seems even smaller. Therefore, the German army is calmly waiting for the offensive initiated by the Soviet Union. The Germans are confident that the landing battle will end in a major defeat for the anti-Axis forces.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 30th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to the Haitong News Agency, London officials announced: US troops stationed in Britain are currently conducting large-scale offensive exercises on the desolate coasts of England. The landing forces are conducting simulated battles with the defending forces on the shore with artillery and tanks. The landing forces are also attempting to establish bridgeheads on the shore with the assistance of warships and aircraft. Several coastal cities have been evacuated to prepare for General Eisenhower's army to perform the offensive exercises.</p>
<p>Huge Invasion Plan Approved by the Big Three</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 30th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to the Haitong News Agency, London sources: A special correspondent of the British semi-official news agency stated that General Eisenhower and General Spaatz of the Allied Air Force had drafted a huge plan to invade Western Europe before the Tehran and Cairo Conferences. At the beginning of the Cairo Conference, Eisenhower and Spaatz secretly flew to Cairo and presented their plan for invading Europe to the military conference. Anti-Axis military generals considered this plan to be valuable, and it was later discussed by Churchill and Roosevelt in Tehran with Stalin. As a result, Eisenhower and Spaatz were elected as the main generals for the invasion of Western Europe. When Roosevelt and Churchill went to Tehran, Eisenhower and Spaatz presented their detailed plan, which was also approved by Stalin, Molotov, Voroshilov, and others. Therefore, the Tehran Conference was able to decide on this matter in four days.</p>
<h3>Goebbels' New Year's Article: Optimistic about the War Situation</h3>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The German New Agency reported that German Propaganda Minister Goebbels published an article in "Deutsche Wochenzeitung," discussing how the anti-Axis countries have failed in both military and political aspects in their operations against Germany over the past year. He compared the Germans to policemen, and the British and Americans to hooligans, and said that one should not retreat because of the evil of the hooligans. In conclusion, Goebbels encouraged the Germans to fight hard and win, so that they could turn weakness into strength and benefit future generations. The translation of the article is as follows: 1943 was our year of testing. In this year, Germany's task was to maintain the economic and military position it had gained in its previous major offensive. This position is closely related to Germany's security and is a prerequisite for the final victory. Therefore, it was expected that the enemy would fight to the death to seize this position, but the enemy did not succeed. Although the enemy launched a strong attack, it did not shake the foundation of the war situation. Goebbels went on to recall the objectives announced by the enemy in the past year, saying that London and Washington also admitted that they had failed to achieve their objectives. From this point of view, we can express satisfaction with the war situation in 1943. The enemy has been mistaken about the military efforts of 1943, and their political developments are inevitably shortsighted. Did the enemy not often predict that Germany would encounter a mental collapse? But what was the result? Today, when the Germans are shouldering the heavy responsibility of the fifth year of the war, they are still determined to fight and win as before, and their determination has never been stronger than it is today. This can be discerned without being an optimist. On the contrary, Britain and the United States have exaggerated their propaganda and created an atmosphere in most parts of the world, as if their victory is a fait accompli and not worth discussing further, especially the chapter on war criminals, which they relish. Goebbels said that the enemy has committed all kinds of crimes against humanity, culture, and scholarship in this war. The enemy has starved millions to death, forcing them to maintain political neutrality, and massacred women and children to make their male relatives lack the courage to fight. They have also bombed cultural buildings in Europe for two thousand years as if they were postcards. Who are the so-called war criminals, the enemy or us? Young Germany, fighting against financial groups and communists, is the spokesman for world culture. We must complete our historical mission, otherwise humanity and justice will decline. Our responsibility is truly indescribable, because this war is not an ordinary war, but a war of the whole world against the enemies of human society. Its survival depends on our actions. The enemy wants to demoralize us with base means and cruel acts of war, but the past year has proven that they will fail. Under the belief that God will bless us, we have begun to welcome the mysterious coming year. This year will be a dangerous year, and humanity will be closer to catastrophe. Millions of German soldiers will raise their guns at the end of the year and invigorate their spirits. Millions of German farmers and workers will be busy with the work of sickles and hammers, and even more millions of mothers and children will complete their beauty. This is Germany today. Our ancestors handed over to us a weak and humiliated Germany, but we will hand over to our descendants a strong and great Germany. This is the purpose for which we are fighting for victory in this war, and there will be things to prove it in every new year.</p>

<h3>British Forces on Italian East Coast Halted in Advance; U.S. Forces in West Deploy Northeast</h3>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) – Havas News Agency reports: The vanguard of General Montgomery's forces, attacking German positions near Ortona, has been halted. The British hope of advancing directly to Pescara after the German withdrawal from the city has been dashed. The British advance along the Adriatic coast is affected by the German control of Majella. British progress towards Pescara will face even greater obstacles. General Montgomery may launch an offensive on the left flank south of Majella and cooperate with the main force in the center. Near Orsogna and Guardiagrele, British pressure has increased. Fierce fighting continues in the Apennines. The positions of the U.S. Fifth Army appear to have been deployed northeast. The U.S. forces have been observed near the left flank, held by the British Eighth Army, in the area of Venafro and Alfadena. There have been few changes in the main German lines near Cassino. U.S. forces in the west continue to attack various high ground. North of the highway from Mignano to Cassino, anti-Axis forces have increased their strength. The left flank of the U.S. Fifth Army in the Gulf of Gaeta remains relatively inactive.</p>
<h3>British and American Political Offensive in the Balkans</h3>
<p>Foreign correspondents for Swiss newspapers have recently been reporting on the situation in Bulgaria, mainly concerning the dispatch of reinforcement troops to Bulgaria, the secret emergency cabinet meeting of the Bulgarian government held on the 1st of this month, and the particularly frequent diplomatic exchanges between Sofia and Moscow in recent days. German authorities deny the troop deployment claims, and the Bulgarian government also explicitly denies holding a secret cabinet meeting. However, after the Cairo and Tehran conferences, there is no doubt that Britain and America have launched a vigorous political offensive in the Balkans.</p>
<p>British and American Political Maneuvering</p>
<p>Churchill has been engaged in political work in Cairo, meeting with former Greek King George II on the 9th and former Yugoslav King Peter on the 10th. Furthermore, the British and American air forces have indiscriminately bombed Sofia, and U.S. Secretary of State Hull has threatened the Baltic states allied with Germany. Thus, Bulgaria seems to be becoming the center of attention. However, this political work will likely be meaningless because the Bulgarian military leadership, based on their traditionally pro-German stance, remains loyal to the German-Bulgarian alliance. Regarding British and American activities in the Balkans, the Soviet Union is taking advantage of the following: 1. special ethnic relations; 2. domestic and foreign local activities in Bulgaria; 3. its neutral relationship with Bulgaria, to make Bulgaria its protectorate. Therefore, the issue is becoming increasingly complex. From the perspective of Britain and America, the Balkan issue remains fraught with many difficulties.</p>
<p>For Britain and America, whether from the perspective of current strategy or future plans, the Balkan issue is the most urgent and concrete problem. If Britain wants to reach some agreement with the Soviet Union at the Tehran conference, there must be some compromise on the issue of the second front in the Balkans. According to an American officer, Stalin seized every opportunity during the conference to emphasize that the Red Army had suffered eight million casualties. From this fact, it can be inferred that Stalin intends to prevent British and American proposals regarding postwar issues, insisting that the war has not yet ended, so it is not the time to discuss postwar issues. It seems that Britain and America are not allowed to discuss basic issues.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Demands a First Front</p>
<p>If this inference is correct, then the content of the conference is naturally limited to current military issues, and the second front is obviously the target. From the Soviet point of view, the second front issue has recently changed its tendency somewhat. The Soviet demand remains for a true second front against the German western fortifications. If Britain and America are also busy opening a second front this year, then Britain and America must realize the possibility of losing the Balkans. Britain and America believe that attacking the Balkans is the most convenient operation because Britain and America already have bases in southern Italy, and the British Ninth and Tenth Armies and other forces are waiting in the Cairo and Syrian areas. However, from a political point of view, the future of the British and American advance into the Balkans is fraught with difficulties. First, because of the existence of Bulgaria, Bulgaria is completely different. Second, because of the existence of Yugoslavia. This is an extremely difficult issue to deal with. Because Yugoslavia currently has two regimes, one led by Tito and the other by the exiled King Peter in Cairo, the British government is currently at a crossroads in deciding its policy towards the exiled Yugoslav regime.</p>
<p>According to the Standard Evening News, Tito dispatched a delegation to see Yugoslav King Peter II, carrying a compromise plan to dismiss Defense Minister Mihailović as a condition to welcome the King as the commander-in-chief of the Yugoslav Liberation Army. The Daily Mail, which previously often criticized King Peter, has recently changed its tone. The Times seems to support the Tito regime and is again advising King Peter to accept the compromise plan. These facts indicate the progress of some kind of political maneuvering centered on Yugoslavia. If the Soviet Union makes some concessions on the Balkan issue for Britain and America, then the Soviet Union will demand that the premise be that a true second front be opened in Western Europe. At the same time, it will argue that the Balkan offensive must take the form of joint operations with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Intends Joint Operations</p>
<p>According to London intelligence, the Soviet Union intends to undertake one wing of joint operations, advancing south along the Black Sea coast. Therefore, this joint operation is possible. However, even if Britain and America can control the Dardanelles and win over Turkey as a friendly neutral country, it would be quite difficult to attack the Balkans through Turkey. Military experts are convinced that the German side can secure the Dardanelles. Therefore, the Soviet army's advance along the Black Sea and the simultaneous true invasion of the Balkans will be unlikely. However, British newspapers are speculating about Turkey's attitude, saying that something very important is about to happen in the Balkans. Even The Times is giving readers this impression. Because launching airstrikes on the Balkans from Turkish territory cannot be said to be "the big thing that is about to happen." Especially given that the Tehran conference was limited to discussing military issues, America seems to be forced to engage in the large-scale battle they least want to. If they hope to obtain pleasant results from the Tehran conference, then their attempt must be regarded as completely overturned. The Moscow, Cairo, and Tehran conferences held recently are like puzzles shrouded in black clouds. Behind those black clouds is what Britain and America are promoting, the "European peace theory." The results of the Tehran and Cairo conferences exposed the true situation behind the black clouds. The strategies and intentions of Britain and America have been completely revealed.

<h3>Wartime Consumption Special Tax to be Levied from the 16th; Retail Tax Rate Set at Four Percent</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance has been ordered to prepare the Wartime Consumption Special Tax. The draft tax law has been prepared and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for submission to the Executive Yuan for presentation to the Supreme National Defense Council for approval and implementation. It was originally scheduled to be levied from January 1, 1944, but due to insufficient preparation and the fact that the measures have not been approved by the highest authorities, it has been ordered to be levied from January 16. It is reported that the retail tax rate in this special tax has been set at four percent.</p>
<h3>Electricity Restrictions Set for Flour Mills; Flour and Wheat Committee Agrees with Central China Water and Electricity Company</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the Business Control Commission and the Central China Water and Electricity Company have agreed on regulations for the electricity needed by affiliated flour mills, which will be implemented by the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee. The details of the electricity agreement between the two parties are recorded below:</p>
<p>Required Electricity Should Be Regulated</p>
<p>Regarding the electricity used by the flour milling industry, the Central China Water and Electricity Company and the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee, after joint research, believe that the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee should be responsible for reducing the electricity required by all flour mills. Therefore, the committee should regulate the electricity needed by these mills. As for the implementation method, it is proposed to first reduce the electricity required by mills that are currently outside the control circle and buy wheat at black market prices to make flour, which is then sold on the black market, and other small flour mills, so that their electricity consumption is calculated at 40% or 30% of the normal rate. It is also proposed to implement the temporary measures for the management of flour mills and other small flour mills, which were previously approved by the National Government, so that all flour mills are subject to these measures. In this way, the flour that has always been sold on the black market can be used for normal rationing, and it is estimated that the production volume can be increased by 15%.</p>
<p>Guiding Flour Mills Towards Rationality</p>
<p>Furthermore, it has been found that the electricity required for a bag of flour is at most 3.5 kilowatts and at least 1.5 kilowatts. Based on the electricity consumed, it is possible to determine the quality of the equipment and the skill of the factory management. In order to ensure that flour production is not affected and to achieve the effect of saving electricity, the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee plans to guide all affiliated flour mills to use electricity rationally and to increase the allocation of raw wheat to factories that have achieved outstanding results in saving electricity as an encouragement. Regarding the current measures, the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee plans to announce the flour production volume and the amount of electricity required for the next month by each factory under its jurisdiction, and then notify the Central China Water and Electricity Company to supply electricity accordingly. Therefore, this restriction of electricity will not only not hinder flour production, but will also ensure low costs and increased production, making a significant contribution to promoting control work. The Central China Water and Electricity Company has agreed to notify the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the electricity consumption of each flour mill every month to show full cooperation and prevent flour from flowing into the black market.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Citizens' Thrift Association Reorganized Yesterday; Constitution and List of Directors Approved</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Since its establishment, the Shanghai Citizens' Thrift Movement has spared no effort in promoting thrift. Now, the Ministry of Social Welfare of the National Government has formulated the organizational rules for thrift associations to promote thrift universally. After being approved by the fourth joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the association, it was reorganized into the Shanghai Special City Thrift Association. The reorganization and establishment meeting was officially held at the Ningbo Guild Hall on Xizang Road at 11:00 AM yesterday. Ding Mocun, Minister of Social Welfare, personally attended and delivered instructions. Hundreds of member representatives of the association attended, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Meeting Details</p>
<p>Officials attending included Cui Jingyu (representing the mayor), Yuan Jufan, Sun Mingqi, Yuan Ludeng, Xu Tianshen, and dozens of others. The meeting was held on time. The presidium included Zhang Yipeng, Pei Yunqing, Gu Nanling, Chen Dongbai, Lu Feng, Lu Guangjie, Ren Quopeng, Hu Shouqi, Chen Jiufeng, Cheng Zhiliang, Wan Xuefang, and others. After all attendees performed the necessary rituals, the chairman, Zhang Yipeng, delivered an opening speech, explaining the three aspects of the reorganization: 1. Organizational affiliation. 2. Relationship with higher authorities. 3. Key instructions before and after the reorganization, 4. Expansion of association affairs. He said that the enthusiastic participation of members today shows unlimited bright prospects for the future. Finally, he encouraged everyone to work hard to achieve the success of promoting thrift. Then, Minister of Social Welfare Ding delivered instructions, with many words of encouragement. Chen Jiufeng read out the constitution, which was unanimously approved with enthusiastic applause. The list of directors was also approved. Finally, temporary motions were submitted to the executive committee for handling, and the meeting was adjourned successfully.</p>
<p>Minister Ding's Speech</p>
<p>Minister Ding's speech briefly stated that the necessity of thrift is beyond discussion. However, the target of promotion should not be the majority of poor and impoverished people, who have already saved as much as possible, but rather the small number of extravagant and luxurious people. This is the first point to note. When promoting thrift, we should use theory to convince others, make them understand, and make them save automatically. Furthermore, we should advise or correct them. This is the second point. In all matters, we must not violate human nature, and especially not destroy government laws or hinder local security for the sake of promoting thrift. This is the third point. The Thrift Association is composed of adult citizens who have been tempered in society for a long time, can deeply understand human nature, and can certainly take into account government laws and local security.</p>

<p>(Chairman) Zhang Yipeng, (Executive Directors) Pei Yunqing, Jin Zongcheng, Xu Xiaochu, Gu Nanling, Zhan Peilin, Lei Zizhi, Chen Dongbai, Lu Feng. (Secretary-General) Lu Feng.

<h3>Wu Bojin and His Brothers Donate Birthday Gifts to Education; Donate 7,500 Yuan to This Newspaper's Scholarship Fund</h3>
<p>This newspaper received a letter yesterday from Wu Bojin and Wu Boyu, stating that the 25th of this month is the 50th birthday of their mother. In view of the difficult times and wishing to avoid extravagance, they accepted the generous gifts from relatives and friends. Unable to refuse, they donated a portion of the birthday gifts, totaling 7,500 yuan, to this newspaper's scholarship fund to cultivate talent and benefit relatives and friends. The profound significance is deeply admired.</p>
<p>Zhendan Pharmaceutical Factory Medical Scholarship</p>
<p>This newspaper received a letter from Zhendan Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory stating: Our factory believes that our country has a vast territory and a large population, and the number of doctors in the country is not sufficient to meet the proportional needs. Compared with advanced countries, there is a great difference. In addition, there is a shortage of pharmaceutical technology talents. Both of these factors have a direct and indirect impact on the health of our people. Therefore, the cultivation of medical and pharmaceutical talents cannot be ignored. As a member of the pharmaceutical industry, our factory aims to fulfill its responsibilities. Coinciding with New Year's Day this year, which is the anniversary of our factory's founding, we have decided to dedicate a portion of the operating income for the 32nd year to the promotion of pharmaceutical talents, called the Zhendan Pharmaceutical Factory Founding Anniversary Medical Scholarship. (The details are in a separate charter.) In order to handle it properly, we dare to arrange all procedures. We hope to be of some use, even if it is not enough to popularize it to poor students who are interested in medicine and pharmacy. However, our factory's intention is simply to fulfill our duty to take from society and use it for society. The sum of 25,000 yuan will be used as the scholarship fund. The quota is set at 50 students, divided into 40 medical students and 10 pharmacy students, in order to supplement tuition and fees. Shen Bao and Xin Bao each belong to the department (20 medical students and 5 pharmacy students.)</p>

<h3>Kong Xiangxi's Cousin Cao Shoutian Escapes from Chongqing to Shanghai; Discusses the Reality of Chongqing's Financial Corruption</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Cao Shoutian, cousin of Kong Xiangxi, former confidential secretary of the Central Bank and director of the Eastern Sichuan Tax Bureau in the Sichuan-Kang region, having witnessed the reactionary acts of Chongqing and deeply felt the error of the war of resistance, traveled thousands of miles, recently escaped from Chongqing to Shanghai, and is participating in the peace movement. He is reporting everything to the relevant authorities. The number of private followers and others with surpluses of tens of millions of yuan is not small.</p>
<p>The U.S. loan was established after running by Song Ziwen, the "Foreign Minister" of Chongqing last year with a loan of 50 million U.S. dollars, mortgaging Chongqing's main materials such as steel, silver, oil, and wool. The U.S. side exchanged it for inferior weapons. Since the friendly Japanese army occupied Burma last year, the Yunnan-Burma Road has been cut off, and the transportation mechanism cannot be extended. Ten transport planes flying daily from Kolkata were used to transport goods to Kunming. On average, each plane only carried 20 cans of gasoline, a small number of light weapons, and private items needed by Chongqing. In addition to the four cans of gasoline required for the round trip, the remaining 16 cans could only maintain the current amount of gasoline used by Chongqing's aircraft and private use. The amount of military supplies transported was extremely small. Therefore, the so-called Chongqing-U.S. loan is actually a trick to deceive the public. At the same time, in order to strengthen its utilization, Chongqing issued so-called "National Construction Thrift U.S. Dollar Savings Bonds," promoting the convenience of studying in the United States, exchanging Chongqing currency for the bonds, replacing the purpose of the Chongqing-U.S. loan. On this point, the U.S. financial community is deeply dissatisfied with Chongqing's despicable plan.</p>
<p>Before leaving Chongqing at the end of October, I stayed in Kunming for two months. At this time, Chongqing was talking about dreams to supply and rebuild the army, preparing to open the Yunnan-Burma Road. Now the Chongqing troops stationed in India are all under the command of Lord Mountbatten, and Chongqing is indifferent. During my years of serving as the director of the Eastern Sichuan Tax Bureau, the annual tax revenue exceeded the fiscal revenue. I carefully eliminated malpractices and governed impartially. However, the Chongqing authorities were昏聵and blindly witnessed various reactionary acts. I deeply felt the harm of the war of resistance to the country, so I returned to Shanghai via an alternative route and joined the peace movement. From now on, under the leadership of President Wang, the highest leader, I will do my best to work for peace and national construction.</p>

<p>Comments from the Economic Sector</p>
<h3>End of the General Clearing Period</h3>
<p>Today is the end of the general clearing period for banks and money shops. The joint reserve of the banking industry and the joint reserve of the money shops have long been prepared to provide accommodation to the banks and shops, doing their best to facilitate circulation, but must be limited to the proper use of each bank and shop. During this general clearing period, the central authorities have also made every effort to adjust to facilitate the activity of cash on hand. Therefore, at the end of this year, the tightness of money in the market is not as severe as in previous years, and all industries, except for a few engaged in speculation, can safely get through the end of the year, which is a clear proof of the proper financial allocation during the war and is gratifying to our economic community.</p>
<p>It is heard that in the past one or two days, a small number of banks, shops, companies, and businesses engaged in speculation, because they are unable to struggle, will close down. What we hope is that some of the various abnormal speculative transactions in this city will be extinguished due to the end of the year, and that there will never be a chance for a resurgence, and the responsibility of preventing problems before they arise still lies with our financial community; this practical responsibility is extremely important, because the instability of people's lives over the past year is directly due to the stimulation of prices by all speculative businesses. We have said that restricting price disturbances from the perspective of currency and finance is ultimately a price policy of "drawing firewood from under the pot." Therefore, in the future, we must pay more attention to the management of bank lending, so that capital for operating all improper businesses will no longer be obtained, and then the entire production industry will have a bright future.</p>
<h3>Banks and Money Shops Will Change Office Hours from Next Year: 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM</h3>
<p>In order to save electricity, the banks and money shops in this city have decided to change their office hours from January 1, 1944, as follows: 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM daily, and 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM on Saturdays. The Bankers Association has notified all members to comply.</p>
<p>Implementation of Unified Accounting Subjects</p>
<p>Regarding the unified accounting subjects for banks and money shops, a consensus has been reached after discussions between the Central Reserve Bank and various banks, money shops, and trust companies. According to reporters, banks and money shops have implemented unified accounting subjects since the 27th, divided into liability, asset, asset-liability joint, and profit and loss categories.</p>
<h3>The Firewood and Charcoal Association is Formally Established</h3>
<p>The association organization for businesses dealing in firewood and charcoal in this city previously only had three trade associations, such as firewood and charcoal, and miscellaneous firewood, before the incident. After the incident, they were divided into trade associations for firewood and charcoal, firewood and charcoal shops, miscellaneous firewood, and tree firewood. This time, in order to adapt to the wartime system, the authorities in this city have allowed the organization of a firewood and charcoal industry association, which convened an inaugural meeting at Cang Xi Shuchang a few days ago.</p>
<h3>Off-Exchange Trading of Chinese Stocks Tends to Be Firm</h3>

<h3>Cold Weather Clothing Donations to Close Today; Future Donations to Be Used for Other Assistance Funds</h3>
<p>At the request of readers, this newspaper launched a cold weather clothing donation campaign, which, although temporary, has received enthusiastic support from all sectors, and the results have exceeded expectations. The warmth of social sympathy is evident here. It has been decided to close the campaign today. All manufactured cold weather clothing will be distributed successively until it is finished. Future donations from all sectors will be used for other assistance funds. In addition, Mr. Rong Boyun and Dharma Master Fan Cheng have put a lot of effort into the planning of clothing materials and sewing for this cold weather clothing donation campaign. On behalf of the poor people who have benefited, we express our gratitude.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received a letter from the staff of the Xinfu Woolen Company, saying: "In recent years, the disasters have not subsided, and we often hear cries in the wilderness. The country is suffering from famine, and the rooms are empty. People are gaunt and emaciated, and even if we give them food, they are still in rags. The situation is like the Zheng Xia's map. Moreover, the weather is cold and the year is coming to an end, and the clothes are like tattered quail. Who does not have parents? Who can be without feelings? However, we are ashamed that we are not wealthy and cannot help the current difficulties. We are pleased to hear that your office is raising funds for cold weather clothing, so we will offer the 5,000 yuan collected by our colleagues. We know that the amount is small, like a drop in the bucket, but it is also a small gesture." The donations received yesterday are as follows: teachers and students of Yangjian Primary School jointly donated 1,028 yuan; Wu Xuan (son's full moon celebration donation) 1,000 yuan; Li Liang 40 yuan; Zheng Zhou's family 200 yuan; Pingji 300 yuan; Li Liang Xilu 500 yuan; staff of Xinfu Woolen Company 5,000 yuan. The total received is 8,068 yuan. The balance carried forward from the previous period is 235,243.65 yuan.</p>
<h3>A Weary Traveler in a Foreign Land Sells Wine to Support Education</h3>
<p>A weary traveler in a foreign land wrote yesterday: "At the end of the year, I received a bottle of Shaoxing wine from my subordinates as a token of respect. After receiving it, I pondered for a long time. When I was fifteen years old, my family fell into decline. I carried firewood and fetched water, working hard, but still could not afford tuition. Fortunately, the principal took pity on me and allowed me to enroll at half price, and I began to learn something. Now that the world is in turmoil, there are countless people who aspire to learn but are struggling financially. I think that I am not a drunken old man, I have neither the talent of an immortal nor the elegance of Su Dongpo. I am ashamed to receive something that is not suitable for me, so I will sell it for cash and offer the 500 yuan to meet the needs of loaning for education, and to benefit my subordinates. If the dignitaries in Shanghai can be moved by this and transfer the funds for a prosperous year to support education, then the seeds will grow faster under the rain and dew. Who knows if it will not be the fortune of society and the blessing of the country?" (Note: The funds have been included in the scholarship fund.)</p>
<p>A Poor Teacher Begs for Robes: I am a poor scholar who makes a living by teaching. The income from teaching is far from enough to support my family. Recently, the cold wind has been whistling and the severe cold is approaching. My old clothes are already tattered and unbearable. I have no choice but to appeal to the kind people in society to donate the robes they no longer want to wear to help me. Peng Xiaozhi. (Note: The cold weather clothing issued by this office is only a cotton-padded jacket and trousers. If various sectors donate old robes, this office can deliver them on your behalf.)</p>
<p>Lost and Found: Mr. Zhang Ruoliang found a bunch of keys on Beijing Road. The owner is requested to come to this office to claim them.</p>

<p>By Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Youth (7)</p>
<p>Army Major Kikuchi had only been a teacher in the puppet school for three years, but the influence on him was extremely great. Major Kikuchi was from Kumamoto Prefecture and was already in his forties at the time. But because of his sturdy physique and thick mustache, he always looked energetic and young. Because of his old stomach problems, he was transferred to be an assigned officer. Originally, he should have been a warrior shouting orders in the field. He had a firm will, acted strangely, and did not make polite remarks to anyone. Only he sometimes reprimanded the resolute Principal Kawada in person.</p>
<p>"You seem too arrogant. As the saying goes, when in Rome, do as the Romans do."</p>
<p>"No, my doctrine is that when in Rome, the Romans do as I do."</p>
<p>Because of this temperament, he did not care about anything when he took office and started the student style reform movement. He started a trumpet section, a shooting section, a poetry recitation section, a national defense comfort society, etc. in the school. He did what he thought was right. He did not care about other people's criticisms. Regarding Major Kikuchi's self-confidence, the following story is still circulating:</p>
<p>When General Takahashi Sanekichi led the fleet into Kagoshima Bay, Major Kikuchi said to Principal Kawada: "This is a good opportunity, please invite Commander Takahashi to speak! Please gather the students to the sports field."</p>
<p>"That's great. Have you already received the general's permission?" the principal asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>"No, not yet."</p>
<p>"Then you're making a big fuss."</p>
<p>"Never mind, please gather the students to the sports field."</p>
<p>Without waiting for a reply, Major Kikuchi ran out of the school gate and hired a car on the road. An hour later, General Takahashi appeared on the podium set up in the sports field.</p>
<p>"It's really too rushed, and I can't say anything systematic for a while..." the general said with a chuckle, and began his speech.</p>
<p>Even so, Major Kikuchi was also very easy to impress people. He affectionately called the failing bad students to his home. Major Kikuchi only told him to get up early. From the next morning, he had breakfast at Major Kikuchi's house and then went to school. In less than a month, the bad student seemed to have changed, and there was no need to worry about failing.</p>
<p>"Decide and act, and even ghosts and gods will avoid you." This was Major Kikuchi's mantra. It was his creed. The author remembered these words deeply in his mind, and did not forget them even nine years later.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Work of the Shanghai Refugee Learning Institute</h3>
<p>C. Skill Training: After the refugees enter the institute, they emphasize learning and production, so that they have the spirit of self-reliance and can become good citizens of society after leaving the institute. Therefore, the institute attaches equal importance to indoctrination education and vocational education for the labor and skill enhancement of refugees, according to the agreed plan, and specially established a Craft Promotion Committee to promote various technical training, and hired technicians to specialize in teaching. The training subjects are as follows: Horticulture; Crops; Animal husbandry; Knitting; Straw weaving; Sewing; Shoemaking; Carpentry; Bamboo work; Washing and dyeing; Food production (making bread and cooking, etc.); Other</p>
<p>D. Basic Knowledge Training: Among the refugees in the institute, there are many who have academic qualifications and skills, but the majority are illiterate and lack skills. Basic knowledge training is the most urgent task at present. The institute uses the dining hall as a lecture hall, schedules time, holds adult and children's education classes, and promotes this type of training. The prescribed subjects are as follows: Literacy; Writing; Abacus calculation (simple bookkeeping); Common sense (social and natural); Other</p>
<p>In addition to the teachers appointed by the Education Committee to be responsible for education, those with excellent academic qualifications among the refugees are selected to assist in their work. Books, stationery, and various supplies are issued by the institute.</p>
<p>E. Life Guidance: Public life emphasizes discipline. The refugees have a fixed schedule for work and rest, and a punctual schedule for daily life. The observance of creeds and the implementation of oaths are guided and promoted by the director and district chiefs at any time, and regulations on assessment, rewards, and punishments are formulated as the standard for supervision. The promoted items are as follows: Various life guidelines; Various factory rules; District self-government training; Other.</p>
<p>5. Promotion of Learning and Diligence</p>
<p>In order to promote learning and diligence among the refugees, the institute divides the refugees into three districts for management: 1. Special District; 2. Agricultural District; 3. Craft District. The work reports of each district are as follows:</p>
<p>A. Special District: After the refugees enter the institute, this district first provides them with indoctrination and training according to their abilities, and then assigns them to work in the agricultural and craft districts. If they cannot abide by the rules or are negligent in the agricultural and craft districts, they are still sent to this district for re-indoctrination, in order to completely change their psychology. Since its establishment, in addition to implementing various life guidelines, it has also vigorously implemented district self-government training to inspire their spirit of mutual assistance and love, and from time to time assigns temporary work to temper them.</p>
<p>B. Agricultural District: This district is divided into three departments: horticulture, crops, and animal husbandry, which are promoted simultaneously. Horticulture Department: This department started in July, and selected dozens of people who were familiar with horticulture to cultivate more than 20 mu of vacant land in the institute, and sowed dozens of kinds of vegetables on time. The harvest in July and August was only able to supply a part of the institute's needs. The harvest in September reached more than 3,000 yuan. It is now trying to gradually expand, and the harvest in the future will increase day by day.</p>
<p>C. Craft District: This district is divided into four departments: grass, sewing, knitting, and carpentry. Since its establishment, it has taken initial shape.</p>
<p>6. Overview of Expenses: The expenses of the institute were previously budgeted by the municipal and district authorities together with the council at 4,191,820 yuan in national currency, with the Shanghai Special Municipal Government responsible for 1,000,000 yuan, the Engineering Bureau (District 1) responsible for 1,500,000 yuan, the French Concession Bureau (District 8) responsible for 750,000 yuan, and the council responsible for 941,820 yuan. This was the situation in the winter of 1942. Subsequently, prices soared indefinitely, and the start-up costs alone exceeded the original budget by more than 1,356,000 yuan. The regular expenses have been paid at more than 3,530,000 yuan in the five, six, seven, eight, nine, and six months after the start-up, and the full year is estimated to require about 7,000,000 yuan. At that time, because the amount exceeding the budget was too large, the council had to raise funds as much as possible to cope with it, which amounted to more than 1,000,000 yuan. Now that rice prices are soaring and prices of various goods are increasing, the funds required for 1944 will inevitably continue to increase. Although the municipal and district authorities are now providing large amounts of donations, and the amount recognized by this council has also reached more than 1,000,000 yuan, the actual amount exceeding the original budget is very large due to the high prices. At this time of exhaustion, we still hope that people of goodwill from all walks of life will provide assistance, promote charitable deeds, and benefit the refugees. This is not a small matter.
