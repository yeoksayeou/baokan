<p>社評</p>
<h3>重慶政權的動向（上）—甲乙二君的一問一答</h3>
<p>甲：九月二十六日申報星期評論「論全面和平」巳經看過嗎？</p>
<p>乙：看過了。對於所論今日全面和平成敗之關鍵全在重慶方面一點，很有同感。不過，關於最近重慶情形，太隔膜了，環想請教……</p>
<p>甲：軍慶在不久以前，會舉行「國民黨十一中全會」，接着最近又舉行「第三屆第二次國民參政會」，聽說討論許多所謂「大事」。那宏，就請報出幾個問題，我把所知的奉答如何？</p>
<p>乙：首先，想請教的，今天阻礙全面和平的自然以重慶的拖戰爲主，試問重慶拖戰的力量如何？</p>
<p>甲：這是要從國際關係，內部經濟與民心配合起來，加以觀察，才會得到比較正確的答案的。</p>
<p>乙：請先從軍事方面來說如何？</p>
<p>甲：就目前情形說，重慶的軍力，顯然已大爲削弱，而且還包含着許多危機。不久以前，蘇聯塔期社重慶分社社畏羅果夫發表批評重慶政權的論文，其中說到重慶軍隊方面：「……重慶軍隊的改組，開始暗地裏遭遇了反抗，……以訓練新幹部及加强紀律爲目的的軍事改革沒有完成。結果，造成軍隊戰鬥力的削弱，以及更加依賴於英美軍火的供給。……」叉說：「重慶並不缺乏人力配備，但是軍隊並沒有經常的補充，沒有　够的受過訓練的後備軍，甚至沒有有組織的人民兵役登記。一直到今天，普通兵役的法律沒有　分執行，軍隊所得到的人員補充大部份不適於兵役。……」</p>
<p>乙：但是，重慶由胡宗南的調練，不是久已宣傳準備總反攻的「新兵訓練」了嗎，</p>
<p>甲：不錯，我們也聽到過。不過，羅果夫對於重慶的新兵訓練也有疵議，他說：「會經參觀過重慶軍隊的外國軍事觀察家都一致認爲兵士在戰塲上很頑强及吃苦耐勞，對於食品及服裝亳不講求，但指揮人員則在軍事及技術訓練上極落後，軍隊的裝備亦然，水平很低，軍隊的組織管理，極不完善。」他還特別指出：「重慶軍隊的缺點之一是缺乏有效的統一領導及各戰塲的配合作戰：內部的磨擦，將領之間的猜忌，不能不减削軍隊的戰鬥力和紀律」。</p>
<p>乙：同情重慶者的批評，決不會太過分的，可見重慶拖戰的實力已到「弩末」階段了。那麼，眞相如何？</p>
<p>甲：觀察目前重慶政治，耍把握住三大中心：第一是國際關係，，第二是渝共關係，第三是民意趨向。綜合這者，加以研究，則重慶動向，就不難推想而知。不過，我們觀察童慶政權的動向，估計力量時，當然不可過低，但是勿宜過高。</p>
<p>先從國際關係說，重慶近來侈言「聯合國四强」，以與英美蘇並列；然而，實際上，重慶是生存在英美蘇對立的矛盾之中，其處境是相當困難的。蘇聯塔斯社分社長指摘重慶的文字，已可看到蘇聯對重慶印象如何了。反面也可看出重慶政權是在趨向於完全對美英附庸的一途了。此外，重慶政權本質中之英美派的獨裁，也更加明顯了！這一點是無論如何不可忽視的。實際成爲英美派的政權，所代表的便是英美帝國主義及少數依附英美者的利益，當然一切政策唯英美的馬首是瞻了。</p>
<p>乙：渝共摩擦問題，近來究竟到到到了什麼程度呢？</p>
<p>甲：據重慶「國民黨十一中全會」對於中共問題之決議要旨，即遵蔣之指示，中共應皤然自反，切實履行四項諾言，即　爲實現三民主義而奮鬥。　取消暴動政策與赤化運動。　取消蘇維埃政府，統一政權。　取消紅軍改編爲「國民革命軍」受「軍委會」統制等。這種措施，完全在於展開政治攻勢，以濟軍事準備之窮，而爭取時間以便大舉進剿。而中共方面，亦並不示弱，磨拳擦掌，準備迎擊，以牙還牙，例如八月問在若干地方，渝共雙方巳有武裝術突。所以，現階段的渝共關係，磨擦時閒愈久，惡化程度就愈深。如無國際環境的牽制，早巳爆發大規模內戰了。</p>
<p>乙：重慶統治下人民的厭戰與離心的個向如何？</p>
<p>甲：從重慶統治各地的出版物趨勢中，可以看出人民對於拖戰與離心的情形了。據今年上半年的統計，出版物方面內容趨勢與上年比較，軟性文藝增至百分之四十八，政治减至百分之丸，經濟减至百分之四，史地减至百分之三，科學减至百分之三，閘揚三民主義者减至百分之一。此種出版趨向情形實在顯示問題之嚴重性，愈是物價高漲生活困難的地方，軟性文蘇讀物格外流行。現在昆明三十二種雜誌中竟有十六種戲劇刊物，而西安各書店木年四月份申請審查發售之一百二十二種圖書中，新舊小說竟佔一百十五種之多。但是，這種「値得隱憂」的現象，如果只說由於「物價高漲生活困難」，顯然是不澈底的，倒不如說足以反映人民厭戰輿不滿於政治較爲老實些。</p>

<h3>締結盟約三週年　軸心國重申決意　日德承認義法西斯新政府</h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　日政府　於今日日德義三國同盟三周年紀念日，與盟邦德國同時正式承認，以纍索里尼爲首之義大利法西斯共和政府。按法四斯共和政府乃二十三日由墨索里尼氏糾合全國同志而組成，墨氏自任總理兼外長，至二十七日更就任該政府之主席。今該政府因日德兩國之承認，已造成如次之各種事實：義法西斯共和政府今後即爲義大利之唯一正統政府，故巴特里奧政權背叛後。日政府對其所採之態度實質上日予否認。同時薩五伊王家爲義大利王家之存在亦被否認。墨索里尼統帥今後即可以該政府全席而具有國家元首之資格。又日德義間既有之國際條約，不必經其他特則手續。而由該政府即時繼承履行。日德義三國自此已確立其較前尤爲明確之鞏固關係，</p>
<p>東京二十七日中央電　日重光外相以二十七日為日德義三國同盟成立三周年紀念，爲表示慶祝起見，特於是日十二時半於官邸招待德　使史培瑪及羅匈等各盟國使節，舉行午飱會，席間重申共同遂行戰爭之決意。重光外相並於席間致詞。蘭明日政府對墨索里尼政府之對策，且力言誓與盟邦相携以擊滅英美。</p>
<p>柏林二十七日中央社電　自義國巴特里奧政權背信脫離三國同，盟後，反軸心方面即　藉此爲離間三同盟國之目標，大施謀略宣傳。德外長里賓特洛甫已定於二十七日藉三國締盟三週年之期，與日重光外相以廣播交換聲明，俾再確認三國同盟之　神。德外交部當局二十六日晚就此曾宣稱：當義巴特里奧政權背叛時，日德兩國政府即同時發表聲明，聞明三國同盟繼續存在，惟今墨索里尼主席已復　。且以新法律爲基礎組織新政府，因此重再確認三國同盟之條約及精神，乃所當然。再者當此日德義三國同盟成立三周年之期，即其他各締盟國亦將確認日德義三國同盟之存　與各國彼此訂立之盟約，俾以粉碎反軸心方面之虛偽宣傳。是故於此再度確認三國同盟以昭示於世界，各締結國必皆一致參加，絕無例外。且恐不特日德兩國，凡所有之締約國皆將　適當之機關或外長，重申確認三國同盟之內容及其目的。</p>
<p>國府當局表示承認</p>
<p>南京二寸七日中央社電　義法西斯共和政府已於鐵腕首相墨索里尼領導下正式成立，於首都羅馬，就任新政府主席，義大利國體因此變更，日德軸心國家均表示正式承認，是則三國軸心仍然　結無間，　可證明，日政府承認於三國締約三週年之紀念日，尤具意義。我政府發言人亦於廿八日對中央社記者表示政府當正式承認義法西斯共和政府正統政府。中義關係自不能因巴特里奧之投降而生變化，各軸心國家之團結必愈見鞏固，共同向打倒英美　國　共產全義之路邁進，我政府發言人之發言，即可視爲我政府承認新法西斯共和政府之表示。</p>
<p>日德外長交換賀電</p>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　日重光外相，德外長里賓特洛甫以二十七日爲締結三國同盟條約三週年紀念日，乃互相交換祝電。茲　　光外相致德外長之祝電原文如次：「本日欣逢三國條的締結三週年紀念日。余謹對閣下深致祝意。日德兩國現正進行自衛之大戰爭，同時於大東亞及歐洲地域分別從事建設公正之秩序，實不勝欣喜之至。日德兩國政府前發表之共同宣言，乃有重大意，余相信日　兩國　密協力，必可獲得最後勝利。」</p>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　德外長里　　洛甫電賀日重光外　，　電文如此：「本日欣逢三國同盟締約三週年紀念日，余於此回憶盟邦諸國軍隊共同應付敵人，收穫榮譽而偉大之戰果，深為快慰，亦唯有此　大之戰果，始能予同盟諸國民以不動之信念，及將來之幸福與自由。</p>
<h3>日本重光外相　對德交歡廣播　向改造世界携手邁進</h3>
<p>一東京廿七日中央社電　日重光外相今日下午七時卅分在束京廣播電台與德外長里賓特洛甫舉行歷史性的交換廣播，披　軸心諸國具有完途戰爭之堅强決心。其演詞要旨加次：英美雖使用種種狡智奸計，誘惑巴特里奧政權作背叛軸心，但軸心同盟決不因此動搖。　同盟條約彪炳如日月，燭照軸心國向獲得最終勝利之途邁進，希特勒元首出於熱烈友情，救出　索里尼氏至安全地域，此事可謂奇蹟之成功墨氏於今日同盟締結紀念日，就任義法西斯共和政府主席之職，日本政府與盟邦億國均已迅速加以承認，故新義大利將再在　索里尼主席領導之下·爭取光輝之將來，以雪被英美强制無條伴投降所蒙之破理壞與恥辱，是所盼望焉。</p>
<p>我人以國家民族及世界相織之構成份子而言。當然享有與其他國家及民旗共同生存之當然權利。此因有了</p>
<p>生存權利</p>
<p>本身既已實際感到威脅。則我人祗有採取自衛手段，並具有貫澈戰爭，爭取勝利之堅固決心。軸心國於以往三年間迎擊敵人之反攻，在東西兩方面隨處擊破其　力，德國在歐洲方而與各同盟國家建立歐洲大要塞，幫以勇猛果敢之攻繫精神，以期擊減敵人。日本亦在大東亞各方面迎擊敵人之反抗，刻正逐次摧破其戰力。故同盟條約之目的，乃在實現世界之正義，我人茲已獲　煊　勝利，其成功自無容疑。日本曾在東亞建設相互協力，獲　安定與繁榮，此乃順應公理及東亞民族必然之要求也。我人現爲達成此</p>
<p>崇高目的</p>
<p>而以其　運奮鬥到底。英美諸國多年來侵略亞洲視之爲甚殖　　或半殖民地恣意榨取，彼等之常套政策即爲分割支　亞洲。我人之擁護生存權者，即在使東亞由英美之侵略下求解放，故我人必須先排除此種侵略榨取勢力。英美現尚未捨棄野心，仍企圖恢復其支配亞洲之舊狀，刻正　續向日本挑戰反攻，但日陸海軍將士之重戰奮鬥，已完全摧破其野望。蓋解放亞洲建設東亞共存共榮之新天地，此原爲我人之共同目的，中華民國已獲解放，且已進行建設而復爲東亞之中國，泰國已發展爲自主獨立之强國，緬甸亦巳完全獨立，菲律賓亦將獨立，印度國亦應獲得解放，如是亞洲民族乃各得其所矣。故此次戰爭一面爲世界正義之戰爭，一面爲</p>
<p>復興亞洲</p>
<p>之戰爭，亞洲各國各民族必須在此一戰中，與歐洲軸心諸國貫澈到底以爭勝利，藉以確保已受威脅之生存權。日本在東亞勇戰之精神，與德國及其他歐洲同盟諸國在歐洲力戰之精神，兩者意義實屬相同。軸心盟國擬在歐亞建設世界正義之目的，將由軸心國之最終勝利而達成此事已甚瞭然矣</p>
<h3>慶祝緬甸獨立　青木大臣致辭　日道義精神充分表現</h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　日各國民運動團體爲慶祝緬甸獨立　特於二十七日下午一時假此間大東亞會館舉行慶祝緬甸獨立大會，到各國民運動團體代表多人，情况至爲熱烈，日靑木大東亞相並特撥冗出席致祝詞、茲誌其大意如次：緬甸之宣佈獨立，即已否認英國之支配東亞，並爲大束亞新秩序建設之一大進展，在世界歷史上實劃一新紀元。大東亞戰爭今巳由紛戰階段而進入決戰階段，敵軍之反攻且漸趨熾烈，緬旬在大戰進行中宣佈獨立者。已充分表現日本之道義精神，使萬邦各得其所，兆民各安其業。並爲日本政府實踐諾言之明證。又昨日所公布之日本承認緬甸　　部等州編入緬領，亦足以證明日本態度之正大光明，諒緬甸全國人民對日本此種態度必能認識，同時東亞各民族以及全世界對日本此種這義措置亦必表示贊同。然凡我大東亞民族應銘記大東亞戰爭若不獲得勝利，則大東亞各國決難自主獨立，大東亞共榮圈亦難建設成功。故緬甸之獨立、惟有在大東亞戰爭完成後始能獲得完全與永遠之保證。日本對於緬甸之獨立決始終擁護之　並對其今後之發展子以全面協力。確信緬甸國民諸君亦必能貫澈日緬盟約之精神，加强與日本之提携，爭取大東亞戰爭之最後勝利。</p>
<h3>義駐滬總領事梅利特　致函日矢野總領事　華中義僑擁護法西斯黨</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　義駐上海總領事梅利特上校，曾於十六日致函日矢野總領事，衷即否認巴特里奧政權，絕對支持法西斯之態度，　願於墨索里尼統帥領導下，指導新僑協力軸心國家完成戰爭。</p>
<p>又訊，以上海爲中心之華中方面義僑，自前上海義總領事梅利特上校首先誓對墨索里尼盡忠，堅決擁護法西斯黨以來，支持法西斯黨之情勢頓告昂揚，一般義僑途紛紛表示願效忠於　索里尼，但當局以該項義僑份子複雜，刻正注視其動向中。</p>
<h3>義公使訪問　滿外交大臣</h3>
<p>新　二十七日中央社電　義駐滿公使聶洛內氏，前赴旅順休養，巳於十二日返抵新京，即於十三日上午十一時訪問李外交大臣。手交聲明文。表示不承認巴特里奧政權，義駐滿外交機關決支持法西斯國民政府、並與日德兩國共同繼續戰爭。聶氏與李外交大臣懇談歷四十分鐘之久始辭出。又義國駐哈爾濱領事馬塞氏，亦曾於是日訪問滿外交部駐哈特派員，手交同樣旨趣之聲明書。</p>
<h3>義駐粵總領事　矢忠新政府</h3>
<p>廣州二十七日中央社電　義駐廣州總領事勒斯，前於十三日曾需告巴特里奧政權外相，此後與該政權完全斷絕關係，永久矢忠法西斯政府。又該氏曾對記者稱，渠實衷心痛恨巴特里奧之背叛，而對挽救祖國危機之新法西斯政府則絕對信賴。</p>

<p>柏林二十七日中央事訪員哈瑪上校稱：星期六蘇軍在東綫消耗大戰之各焦點繼續竭力企圖擊破德軍之防綫，蘇軍在古班橋頭開始大規模之登陸行動，意欲達到上述之目的中部聶伯河區，紅軍傘兵同時在德軍陣綫之後方降陸，但蘇軍之一切企圖均為德守軍所阻，蘇軍希望東綫中部與南部之天氣情形轉變惡劣，使德軍之行動受阻，但此項希望終成泡影，東綫各地區之戰爭，迄未見鬆懈、蘇軍不僅以各師團，而且以全部軍團加入作戰，而繼續蒙受極重大之死傷，蘇軍「爲麺包之攻勢」，已發展爲大規模之消耗戰，爲自存起見，蘇軍將不得不繼續此種戰爭，而不復顧及其無法抵補之損失。</p>

<h3>德在大西洋採用　潛艇新戰術　尼資攻勢復活</h3>
<p>柏林二十七日中央社電　德潛艇隊司令寶尼資元帥本年初就任海軍總司令以來，德潛艇作戰乃頓形活躍，所謂「竇尼資攻勢」、英美聞之亦爲之胆落。後因英美方面防禦潛艇之武器達最高紀錄，四月以後其戰果則逐漸縮减，致德潛艇隊　漸入於無聲無臭之狀態。德軍司令部於二十四日之戰報中，曾發表久疏之德潛艇大戰果，表明德潛艇已再展開攻勢。關於獲此戰果之新兵器，雖尚朱表明其種類及性能，然會報大於此次潛艇戰。不僅使用新兵器。並首次採用新戰術。德潛艇向即以攻擊運輸船爲其主要目標、故於每次攻擊均集中全力於運輸船，對於護衛艦則不加攻擊。其後此方法已爲英美窺知，不克復行採用，故德國乃由　尼資元帥以下各具有高超智能之人員研究新戰術，而終於獲得此次之攻　戰法。蓋此次乃做效日本潛艇之戰術，而傾注全力首先攻擊軍艦，而發攻擊運輸船。當潛艇駛近護送船團後，首對護衛驅逐艦羣加以攻擊，以百折不繞之精神，謀毀減驅逐艦而後，潛艇則將銳鋒轉向運輪艦團，對其護衛艦無力抵　之運輸船，加以痛烈之攻擊。故曾獲有擊沉英　　逐　十二艘之大戰果，已　英美以極大打擊。英美方面對此似亦極為狼狽。使用新兵器採取新　法之德潛艇隊，甚新攻勢今方開始，聞德軍首腦部對此抱有極大之自信，蟄伏六個月後再度展開之　尼　功勞，今後於大西洋上將愈益活躍，將予英美運輸網以痛烈之打擊。</p>

<h3>義山區英美軍　偵察性攻勢　遭德軍猛烈砲火擊退</h3>
<p>柏林二十七日中央社電　德國新聞社駐義大利特派員柏勒納稱。撒勒諾區以及更東在波頓薩區直至受夫里特尼亞灣，英美軍在過去二十四小時內，其活動僅限於偵察性之攻擊，以前數日撒勒諾之西北與蒙脫柯維諾之北各焦點，英美軍節省其殘弱之步乓，而專以增援之砲隊向德軍高頭陣地作戰。康杜爾與波頓蕯以北之前綫，美軍與英軍少數偵察分隊於九月二十五日向德軍先頭陣地謹愼前進、但名處均被擊退，死傷甚多，强大之美軍步兵集團在山谷間展開，遭德軍砲火有效之轟擊，以致美軍先前所計劃之偵察性攻勢無法實行。奉命掃隊德軍地雷之英美軍分隊，遭德軍先鋒隊突然之猛攻，非殲減即被俘。德戰鬥轟炸兩用機空襲英美供應交通，富時發生空戰，敵機二架被擊落，同時德機則毫無損失而完成其任務。</p>
<h3>德元首宣言　允挪威獨立　推行政策永保歐洲安全</h3>
<p>奧斯陸二十七日中央社電　德國新聞社訉：德駐挪威專員德波芬、特於日昨在捌威國民會議席上，向挪威首揆葵士林曁長官期讀德元首宣言加下：召人刻正與布爾雪維克主義暨協助該項主義之財閥作殊死戰。英美在莫斯科之猶太同盟，以機械化之軍隊大舉向西洋文化進攻，而英美資本主義者所付之代價則爲「歐洲」德人首常其衝，犧牲人力物力甚鉅。蓋深知此次大戰，非但將決定此後數世紀之德國及德民族之命運。且將影響歐洲大陸全部之將來，故不惜於現在及將來担負重任，而確信此項決心。將保證勝利之來臨，而爲靖綏歐洲之先決條件。實行靖綏政策後，歐洲始能以全部實力貢獻於精神物質之建設，於完成此項任務之過程中，德元首已決定於獲得勝利後，建設一享有獨立自由之國社主義之挪威，務使挪威能在已提高地位之歐洲社會中，永保歐洲之安全。蓋惟有此種社會，始能代人及保證歐洲之安全也。再此間政界人士，僉謂元首之宣言。實不靑爲挪威國民會議三年來所實行之主要政務下一定議，該項政策以信念爲根基，但其宣佈，尚屬創舉，挪威國民政府固始終忠於該項政策也。</p>

<h3>蘇聯戰力的分析（二）</h3>
<p>德蘇開戰以來，業已二年有餘，如概觀蘇軍的動向，則首先可以看到有二種存在的傾向。一　蘇軍最近對近代化的努力，一是蘇軍之復古的傾向。但這矛盾的二種傾同，并不是絕對對立。因北矛盾故得以統一。在軍事上看，在蘇軍抗戰力的强化上。盡着重要的任務。</p>
<p>蘇軍陣容復振</p>
<p>關於蘇軍在開戰時蒙受很大的打擊。而蘇聯將近崩潰的原因，現在巳經明瞭，毋庸贅述。蓋蘇軍雖有高度地機械化的龐大的大眾軍隊，但首腦部惑於內戰時的光榮，輕視最近代的戰鬥技術之運營，而專賴戰鬥員的士氣，以致有此結果。</p>
<p>當然，戰鬥員的士氣是最應該重視的，是抗戰力之最重要的因素，這是不容疑惑的。然而和極機械化的深諳理想的新銳戰術的德軍對壘，蘇軍首　部之粗略的戰術觀，脆弱地崩漬了，把蘇聯迫逼至重大的危機。</p>
<p>於是蘇軍最高司令官史太林氏，在一九四一—四二年的冬季戰中，決計澈底的改編蘇軍首腦部陣營。代表與論界而大胆率直地要求更迭蘇軍首腦部的，乃是烏克蘭的劃作家，現任外務人民委員部次長要職的亞歷山　爾·果南區克。</p>
<p>果南區克自　年八月二十四日至二十七日的　　　上　　　一篇名爲「戰綫」的戲劇，在各方而引起異常的反響。這「戰綫」是一篇有最高價值的文藝作品，但當作戰術　，更有極大的意義。果南區克在「戰綫」上說，不僅徒然向兵士要求勇氣，不理解近代戰術之複雜的綱目的內戰英雄，斷沒有遂行需要最高技術和知性的對德戰之資格，而要求使這些「老兵」們徒蘇軍首腦部退出。拔擢年輕的，具有近代知識的，理解近代戰是何物的指押官。</p>
<p>同時，果南區克要求蘇軍上自上級幹部，下至一兵一卒，須具有「運用第一等戰鬥技術的知識，」在劇中登塲的飛機廠長，是一個澈底的技術家，指摘「民衆敬愛並希望具有知識和明敏的洞察力的指導者」。</p>
<p>眞理報對該劇特撰社論加以評述稱：「在蘇軍中，沒有才能的指揮官，即使靠着其過去的功續和勇氣，也不能不從指導的地位退下來。」這論調明確地反映了史太林的意向。</p>
<p>於是從去年以來，一向占着蘇軍首腦部地位的伏洛希羅夫，丁莫生柯，普喬努伊，夏博許尼柯夫等諸將領，被迫從第一綫退出，而絡續　　理會近代戰術，尊重技術的新進氣銳的司令官，占蘇軍首腦部的高級地位。</p>
<p>例如蘇軍新參謀總長亞歷山道爾，華希萊夫斯基元師，列甯格勒　結司令官愛里，格伏洛夫大將，伏爾霍夫戰綫司令官加美雷果夫大將，加里甯戰綫司令官馬克希姆，普爾加愛夫大將（最近似已轉任遠東正面軍司令官），頓戰綫司令官加羅果素夫斯基大將，西南戰綫司令官尼果萊。伐茲金大將，南部戰綫司令官馬里諾夫司基大將，北高加素戰綫司令馬斯萊尼果夫中將，伏洛納其戰綫司令官佛岳道爾，果里哥夫大將，蘇軍航空統監部長諾比果夫元帥，砲兵統監部長尼古拉，伏洛諾夫元帥等，全在四十歲前後。其他軍司令官，師團長等，　爲三十　左右的年輕者。</p>
<p>以上的事實。不單是說蘇軍陣營中年齡的復返於年輕，即蘇軍的戰力亦不可同日而語了。此在一九四二—四三年度冬季的蘇軍反攻戰並本年七月五日以來的蘇軍夏季攻勢中，可以很明瞭地看出。史太林不顧一切局外的考慮，漸漸地拔　新進指揮官，令老朽司令官退出，常柱蘇軍部內　成淸新的芬園氣，這是說明蘇軍抗戰力之「亞細亞的神秘」的一種材料。</p>
<p>指揮系統的一元化</p>
<p>蘇軍中其次的重要變化，乃因着軍事委員制的廢止而命令系統的一元化。蘇　最高會議幹部會去年十月九日頒發關於「蘇軍中命令系統的一元化及軍事委員制的廢止」之布告，該布告簡單明暸地說明了確立命令系統一元化的迫切需要之動機。</p>
<p>軍事委員制係爲了監視內戰時在蘇軍首腦部內占獻倒的比重之舊帝俄將校而創設的。當時蘇軍指揮官發布命令時，必需軍事委員會的副署。以至蘇軍的命令系統，完全是二元化的</p>
<p>後來內戰告終後，蘇軍的政治敎育强化起來，所謂布爾歇維克教育灌入的結果，蘇軍指揮官之政洽的敎養，大爲提高。蘇芬戰時，軍事委員制曾一度廢止，嗣即恢復，在德蘇戰爭的一年半之間，繼續存在着。然而跟着戰爭的進行，親自　有近代戰之豐宮經騐的許多新進有爲指揮官之出現，蘇軍在政治軍事二方面乃有觸目的成長。</p>
<p>他方面，軍事委員及政治工作人員。提高自已的軍事的意義，積緊近代戰之豐富的經騐。其一部凖已在前綫充指揮官。其他許多經一定軍事訓練後也立即可以變成指揮官。以上的結果。　軍事委員制得以存在的基礎，完全消滅，如其任軍事委員制再行繼續存在。而分裂指揮系統爲二，則將成爲推行戰事上重大的障害，因此，乃決定廢止軍事委員制。</p>
<p>軍事委員制的廢止，並不是說蘇軍內部的政治教育不再需要的意思，乃因蘇軍指揮官之政治的意識大見提高的結果，軍隊中　於軍事政治上的諸問題　　已成長到可以負一切責任的程度。即以前的軍事委員以至政治工作人員之有內部指揮官的資格者。已被任命爲指揮官，其他也化爲司令官的政治投表，除担任以前蘇軍的政治教育之外，並受指揮官的訓練。</p>
<p>關於上述情形，如柱「紅星」報的社評上說：「担任政治者的工作，不是由集會報告和演說的次數而決定的。乃是由於能否完全遂行部隊的部隊的軍紀和抗戰意識，及戰鬥任務而決定。」故蘇軍中軍事委員制的廢止，乃是最有效地遂行對德戰爭的必要上實施的，因命令系統的一元化，進行作戰乃極順利，而且因以前一樣的布爾歇維克主義教靑之實　，更振作軍紀，加强抗戰力，且養成更有能力的幹部，企圖不再被指揮官的缺乏所困。故軍事委員制的廢止，和命令系統的一元化，可說是蘇軍抗戰力之進一步的發展，</p>
<p>要之，軍事委員制的廢止，並不是因毋須在蘇軍內施行政治教育而予以廢止，似消息報所指，除把命令系新一元化以順利推進戰事外，乃爲了「編成新的預備指揮官，」一切均由遂行對德戰爭的必要上產生的，在這裏可以明　地看到，列甯　敎的一把一切爲了戰　」的標語。蘇聯　在具體的付之實施。</p>
<p>傳統的復活</p>
<p>以前蘇軍的標語是「全世界勞働階級的解放」，今日這標語已成黃粱一夢，而蘇軍的一切旗幟上所標榜的，乃是「爲了祖國」，「爲了史太林」。即在蘇軍以爲今日除「戰爭」以外沒有別的東西存在。所以蘇軍視爲途行戰爭上必要的東四，不論何物，亳不躊躇的立即採用，在那塲合，帝俄時代的制度，業已不成問題，其最要者如本年一月所實施的肩章的復活，創設蘇軍時。蘇維埃政權以肩　爲「反動的表徽」而予以廢止，但當恢復「金肩軍」時，紅星報在社論上說：「肩章是俄羅斯軍隊之傳統的裝飾物。蘇軍是繼承俄羅斯軍隊之榮譽的正統的後繼者，我們不能不用我們祖先的武器鼓舞士氣，承犧强化軍紀上所必要的一切東四。蘇軍爲愛祖國。尊重歷史的傳統實是貴重的東西。肩章不單是軍服之附屬品的意思，實是軍人所誇耀的象徵。</p>
<p>恢復肩章之外，將校的從卒制亦告恢復，蘇聯最高幹部會議更於七月頭布强化蘇軍的階級制度的命令。據此令，蘇軍的階級分類爲兵，下士官、將校、將官四級，革命前俄羅斯軍的階級分爲兵。下士官，將校三級，自蘇軍創設以來，這階級制度予以廢止。單稱將校爲蘇軍指揮官，兵爲蘇軍兵士。</p>
<p>然而蘇軍當局鑒於德蘇戰二年來的經騐，而實施階級制度的强化者，此亦與肩章的復活同樣，乃在提高指揮官及將核的權威，以謀軍紀的振肅。</p>
<p>八月十一日，蘇聯海軍亦採用這制度。自稱爲階級制度之敵的蘇聯，在蘇軍中分出階級，恢復舊俄羅斯軍的傳統者，亦由於遂行戰爭上的必要而來，蘇聯今後爲爭取勝利，將訢諸一切手段。</p>
<p>綜上所述，德蘇戰閱時二載的蘇軍動向，其一是體騐最新技術，有效地遂行對德戰之進步的傾向及欲恢復舊俄羅斯軍隊之傳統的復古的傾向。這二者都依着列甯所規定的「一切爲了戰爭」的根本方針而進行，爲使提高軍事技術，不能不振肅軍紀，鼓舞士氣。爲了振肅軍紀，鼓舞士氣，不能不絡續拔　新進有能力的指揮官。二種傾向不一定是對立的。在這裏，可以求得解決蘇軍抗戰力之「亞細亞的神秘」之關鐺。（本章完）(翻譯：同盟世界選報一二二三號）</p>

<p>主席致詞</p>
<p>大會主席團張一　致開會詞略謂：「今日爲市民節約運動會成立大會，關係節約一項，任何人常決不反對，故節約乃極普通極莊　，節約運動的意義，在大的方面言，節約對國家對社會最重大最密切之事，無論在世界粉亂，但有此克苦耐勞之民族國家，當能保持永久生存，無論社會之如何動　，激起自治自肅精神，決不致失收，是以節約之重要，應舉爲首，若有人言此舉過甚誇大，余以退一步言，由小的方面，以個人生活而言，　個人之生活關繫影響綦鉅，在人生過程中，幼年中心於家庭，靑年中心於婚姻，中年老年之生活，中心則於友誼，在斯三階段中，如歷奢淫逸，不從事節約，則爲害非淺，余舉例　關於家庭不能節約者，兄弟不睦，妯娌失和，爭奪財產，以致家破之危，　關於婚姻方面者，今戀愛自由，此乃天經地義，但男女相愛如願，即可自由訂婚，惟上有長輩者，乃決不有此自由，須持乾坤兩宅之家庭狀況，並誇耀雙方親友，於是因條件之不合，犧牲兒女愛情，此乃司空見慣之事，如家庭之過甚拗嚴，更肇自殺之禍危及生命，　以老年而言，人至老爲謀人生樂趣，終　好友時遇，然於早年交友，一富豪聞氣，一貧窮因　當窮友根水　後，有時叩見黨友，往往爲下僱所阻，是以　　面上交友困難，苦悶良深，故節約由大言對國家社會關繫深切，在小言，則於個人關繫至　，是以節約不能不有運動且，談節約須從個人而行，從事樸素節儉，故節約運動：　不但於每個人節約，且要多數人節約。　不要一時一刻之心節約，要終身節約，此於社會國家　益非淺，首從本位努力運動出發點，先組織集會，才得共同做去，以節約為唯一之信念，應非作個人之信念，更對節約為國家為社會之信念，須養成儉樸良好之風氣。</p>
<p>廣田致詞</p>
<p>大使館上海事務所廣田情報部長致詞，略謂：「今日爲貴會成立，本人躬逢其盛，代表致詞至為　榮，今日在座諸君，乃為上海最有力者節約有利國家社會，值　上海市民自動發起我人表示不勝期待，無論中日兩國。對節約運動。均應積極推行，迥溯中國自辛亥革命以來，無時不在　發團結自強，但中國至今建設尚未獲得成功，實爲英美壓這所致，未能達到使命，自大東亞戰爭爆發後，將英美侵略摩手　淸，重新建設是以在任何地方均得從事節約，以底於成，再中國同情日本對英美作戰，於本年一月九日　英美宣戰，站在同一戰綫，同生共死，以完成大東亞戰爭，不但於武力方面應從武力思想，經濟三方並進，副始得確立大東亞戰爭，由此種種，應充分節約，以貢獻國家，則物資充分，加強經濟力量，無論大小均應貫澈實行，是以節約運動意義至深，直接充實國力，間接安定民生，而上海市民得自動發起組織，我人表示深切期待，同時表示萬分祝賀。</p>
<h3>防空愈趨週密　考慮空襲保險　黃沙水桶須經常備置</h3>
<p>中央社訊　本市空襲措置及民間空襲設備，在各方協力下，市民對於空襲之智識及技巧已漸趨熟練，市保甲委員會爲促使各區防空綱之週密起見，業已令飭所屬各區保甲辦事處分別勸告各該區住戶市民，換戶設置黃沙與水桶等，應經常備置，以防萬一，而使民間防空力量無形充寶。</p>
<p>商業新聞社訊　據日方報紙云，上海之日本「邦人損害保險會社協會」，已奉日本當局之指定，在上海方面推行一空　保險」，其保險契約每半年保額一千元收保險費二元。至於我中國人方面，有關當局亦在考慮推行是項保險，詳細辦法及保險費用尙須加以決定。　悉此次經商統會收買之埠紗棉布，除已實行保險外，對此「空襲保險」亦在考慮之中。</p>

<h3>三輪客車　加價已解決</h3>
<p>最近本市三輸客車出租業同業公會未經主管機關正式核准，寬登報擅自加價，經第一區公署以書面予以警告，並通知該公會補具呈文，申訢加價理由，以憑核辦。旋據呈稱，邇來物價上漲，三輪車重要之原料，如五金車胎等等價格更形高漲，處此情境，無法維持營業，影響於職工生活等語，區公署鑒於三輸客車現爲本市重要交通工具，爲維持客車營業。並顧及全市三輪庫夫一萬餘人之生活計，自不能不予以善意之考慮，設法救濟，但同時市民負擔亦　兼顧、因奉准陳市長核准後，改訂價目。（雙座蓬車起先三十分鐘十八元，每超過五分鐘二元，每超過一小時三十元。單　蓬車起先三十分鐘十二元，每超過五分鐘一元五角，一小時二十一元。雙座轎車起先三十分鐘十八元，每超過五分鐘二元，一小時三十元。）頓知第一警察局轉飭遵辦。</p>

<h3>七期計口食糖　下月二日普售　或每斤提增售價一角</h3>

<p>限期換證繳款出貨</p>
<p>查第七期計口食給，業經本處配給就緒，玆定於本月廿八廿九兩日內發給購貿證，凡經售計口糖之零售商，務須在上開限期內將前發空白收據蓋印來處塡明件額，以憑領取購買證，並限於本月卅日以前向指定糖行繳淸貨款，立即出售，不得延悮爲要，再特一組（即前乙種零售商)用戶換領購貿證日期，另候通告。</p>
<p>本期售價或將微增</p>
<p>至於本期口糖之價格問題，據該處負責人語記者稱，「查本處今後所配之糖，均為軍配當局所配給，每斤成本為四元七角四分，而現售之口糖價格為每斤四元七角，過去因所配售之糖，係本處各股東所有，故對數分之差，不與計較，惟嗣後係代辦性質，故對數分之差，倘以整數計算　為數亦為不小，同時對各當局發給　糖證等之費用，亦由處負責，為顧全成本計，或將每斤提增一角為四元八角，但尙未決定，須待當局核准」。</p>
<h3>物資調查委員會　並未派員沿路查</h3>

<h3>不幸者的學府　記盲童學校（一）</h3>
<p>上海西郊，充滿着詩精畫意的虹橋路上，曾經出　過好幾座著名的文化堡壘，至今魏然獨存的就是麥克勞路東首的創造着人類文明之奇蹟的盲童學校。它有一　壯觀的洋房和一望連雲的田園，雖然經過幾次乓　的蹂躪，却已修葺一新。充滿着和平，靜謐，和令人依戀的氛圍。秋天的金黃色的陽光裏。瀰漫着花，香味的風，送過來師生敎讀的聲音，夾帶着莊嚴和穆的琴聲，激起立刻訪間這座學府的慾望</p>
<p>慘　經營的校史</p>
<p>古城式的門庭裏，出來一位態度和藹的老者，打開高大沉重的鐵門，一　小狗迎了出來，顯得這學府在幽靜中充滿着生氣。副校長，辦理盲人教育事業已達二十九年，但仍充溢着少壯氣派的何志曾先生，首先就告訴你關於盲童學校光輝的歷史。</p>
<p>在三十二年前，正是中華民國誕生前一年，曾經對我國現代思想啓　運動與社會文化事業盡過不少助力的約翰·傳雅蘭博士，接受當時中國一部人熱心人士的意見，獨捐鉅資在今北四川路創辦盲童學校，專收中國盲童，施以特殊教養。當時辦學目的，第一　鑒於無依無靠的流浪盲童之可憐。依上帝愛人，人類同情互助之義，加以收容救濟；第二是使盲童不僅生活無處，並且在學校得特別技藝。將來可以自謀生計。不作社會分利的份子；第三、再進一步，使盲童學成專門技能，將來出校後推廣肓人教育，使今後中國縱有肓童；但是盲人都能爲國家社會服務。</p>
<p>四年的慘澹經營，居然規校略備，而應予收　的無告的盲童，還是觸日　是，盲意學校的事業·亟待擴充。民國四年、在涊西憶定盤路四號，簇然出現了黨皇的新校址，師生們更興奮地努方於教　。至第二年(民國五年）又創辦工藝部，使一般性　相　的盲童學習可以謀生的工藝技能，如編製　器等，同時也使學校可以出賣一些生產品，稱助一般資用。至於學科方面，原係完全小學程度，後來得到聖約翰大學的允許，可以插入該校特設的高中部、於是在民國七年開辦初中部。畢業後保送至聖約翰、以謀深造。</p>
<p>民國二十年四月，盲童學校校長傳步蘭先生以中國代表參加在美國舉行的三十六國國際盲人會議，使各國熱心盲啞教育的知名人士，認識協助中國盲啞教育的重要意義。就在　一年十二月，虹橋路二百九十號，那座完　的新校　也宣告完　了。這裹附建女學校舍，在寒價後就開辦女學部，專心致力於女盲童的教養。中國第一個完善的盲童教養機關，就這樣奠定基礎，　上積極發展的前程。</p>
<p>盲人不盲的秘密</p>
<p>四面八方的　苦盲童，一進盲童學校的大門。過去黑地獄的「生活」就此結束、展開在　　的是光明之路，不僅受到人類間愛的撫育，從此接　　另一個溫暖而團結的世界，並且　的不　是盲目人了！他們可以和平常人一樣讀書識字，進而担負起社會國家一切任務了！這不是幻想的奇蹟，而是很簡單的事實！</p>
<p>那　，盲人怎樣會讀書作工呢？教務主任范福寶先生，一位從事盲人教育二十餘年的半盲的熱心學者，領到該校各部門去參觀，替你解答這個疑問。原來盲人有特製的文字和書藉！「盲字」是由五十四個基水符號，照國音，羅馬字或拉丁字拼音方法，拼成中國文字，連平上去入的聲符以及新式標點符號，一共爲六十九個基本符號。英文連若干常用基本單語與阿拉伯數字在內，只有五十六個基本符號，這種符號拼合起來，即構成單字和語文。也許，有人懷疑這種基本符號太多了，不易記，其實，五六十個基本符號。只是六們凸起點的變化，彷彿我國古代的「八卦一的　化一樣，不過八卦的某本爲「乾」即「三」。以各劃的新　構成六十四「卦」。而盲字基本符號則爲「　　　　　在這六點中以各點的或平或凸構成不同的音符。中文的基本音符爲　　　扯·勒·得·色·特·　·凹·　側·格·客·妹·捏·　·配·費·黑·又·厭·怒·按·昂·廳·　·　·問·　·額·亞·義·　·奧·印二·位·萬·過·要·愛·臥·運·　·用·外·月·瓦·約·悮·夜·阿·怨·望·樣等五十四個聲母及音母。再用這種音符拼音　字。因此，翻開盲人的書籍字典，　是（無字天書），只有一排一排的蟹行的凸點，盲人利用手指的觸覺，代替眼球的視覺，就會很快的念出書上的文句，也會很快的檢查字典。這種識字方法，與國語拉了化一樣，比教　方塊的漢字要容易得多，難怪盲人也能和　盲者一樣　書！可是，科學的進步是　人的。不久以前美國和蘇聯已發明另一種盲人教育工具，大致和留聲機片的構　差不多，把要敎學的課本或　　甚至當天報紙的新聞都灌音入片，　種片子是特　的紙片，重量很輕，可以捲摺寄　，收　後就可依一定的方法，播放　音。大約不久的將來，我國盲人。也可利用這種新式的敎學工　了，不過圖表模型，自然還得利用原有的凸綫凸點符號　等的。說穿了，盲人不盲、原沒有什麼神秘，科學的研究，發現，與　們，　　了自然的缺陷。</p>

<h3>孔聖誕辰感述</h3>
<p>— 王端儒</p>
<p>世衰道微，孔學不昌也久矣，東南人士，惄焉憂之，遂有中國孔聖學會之創設，宿審沈信卿先生主持其事，設總會於上海，蓋因其爲人材薈萃之區，講學問道，易收事半功倍之效也。吾陝鄙處四北，文化落後，　經一綫，不絕如縷，家兄耀先，慨孔學式微，大義微言，湮沒不彰也，乃棄商從儒，請　於張果齊夫子。一旦豁然貫通。更堅其提倡之志，決然毀家與學。端儒追隨其後，亦屢　巨款。購置基地。乃於民國廿四年，在臨潼故里馬額鎭紀王村建立孔廟宗聖學舍，又於零口鎮建設零川祠，內附讀經學舍，復在西安建關學祠關學書院，並於涇　縣封王村續建五夫子祠，景賢書院，皆免費招收生徒，講習國學。又擬在西京市設一周南學校，遵循后妃遺教，以專收女生爲主。此皆端儒兄弟競競業業，經之營之，見諸事實者也。今當至聖先師誕生之辰，敬獻芻言，聊作慶祝，述其所感如此。</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>證券交易所復業</h3>
<p>八一三事變以來停頓已逾六年之上海華商體劵交易所，已由其理事會正式登報啓事，將於明日上午十時舉行復業與　了。</p>
<p>近六年來，滬上體券業始終在非正式的黑市塲上代客貿賣證券，現在　能獲得政府的諒解，能夠在正式的公開市塲上，堂堂正正地代客買賣證券，這委實是值得欣幸的一件經濟上大事。</p>
<p>過去滬市游資出路，多趨向囤貨一途，惟自上月九日政府頒布收買棉紗布以來，此風頓衰。繼而政府命令中央儒蓄會舉辦「特別儲蓄獎劵」，復由中央儲備銀行會同滬上金融界舉行「有獎定期儲蓄迴」，以資吸收市上一部游資。然論者多以爲當局對於吸收游資之最賢明而有效的措施，當推上海華商證劵交易所的奉令正式復業，</p>
<p>可是，天下事往往犯着「扶到東來西又倒」的毛病。恢復華商證券正式交易，誠足以吸收大量游資，但是華商證券正式交易恢復以後，應讀時注意於如何防止投機，　定價格，及嚴格審查上塲證券，以期證券交易，趨於正軌。這乃是當局允許華商證券交易所復樂的本意，也就是華商證券交易所理事會及監理委員會今後最重要的課題。</p>
<h3>經紀人全部確定後　證交正式開拍　明日舉行復業典禮</h3>
<p>上海華商證券交易所，自奉財實兩部會令飭早日籌備復業後，即經召開股東臨時會議，決定增資辦法，積極進行籌備以來，現已將擬就交易所之營業章程，呈經核准，參加股票交易之經紀人巳經呈由實業部審查合格，准予登塲交易者第一批三十九家，第二批日內亦可發表，同時財實兩部派定之交易所監理委員會亦已成立，故該交易所按照現行　則，於二十四日起至廿八日止五天內先行辦理各種上市股票登記。以便審查合格後，准予上市交易，同時定於本月二十九日上午十時舉行復業典禮，該所已　請各主管機關屆時派員蒞塲指導，茲分誌各情如次：</p>
<p>上市證券登記踴躍</p>
<p>該交易所自發出證券上市登記通告後，近日本市各公司所有上市之股票向該所登記者極形踴躍，其登記條件，依照「本所上市股票審查原則」：　股份有限公司，　主管部核准登記給照者，　資水五百萬元以上者，不足五百萬資本而資產總額在一千萬元以上者，　公司組織一年以上者，方可准予登記，其登記表內規定須填明。　公司名稱，　創設年月日，　登記年月日，　總公司所在地，　總工廠所在地，　營業範圍。　專業權，　資水總額，　股份總數，　額定股息，　　毎股票值，　　溢價發行年月，　　優先股名稱，　　公司之歷史、　　資本增减之經過，　　附屬事業，　　最近五年之生產量及或銷售　額，　　最近五年之股息紀錄，　　會計年度，　　分公司或分廠所在地，　　　董事監察人及重要職員，　　　股東持有股份數之分配狀况，　　　備考。</p>
<p>內部組織分三大處</p>
<p>該交易所內部組織在理事長及秘　長之下共分：　總務處，　業務處，　統計處等三大處處理一切業務，據中央社記者向　交易所負責人探悉，明（廿九）日舉行復業典體後，正式開拍股要交易，約於下月十日左右，因市塲經紀人之電話裝設，尚未完發就緒，其上市股票審定後，即由交易所監理委員會，確定發表。</p>
<h3>兩月來地產　交易轉清希稀</h3>
<p>本市地塵交易在市場上佔有重要地位，過去因游資充塞，　貨之風狂熾，地產買賣，即隨之呈，而其價格亦飛速上漲，蓋若干擁有游資者，於囤貨之餘，從而囤積房地產，一般投機商人，更乘時躍起，作「踢皮球」式之買賣，於是漲風一紀，不可遏止，交易熱鬧之時，在本年七八兩月之間，每日平均寬達二十餘起。但自政府當局以斷然手段，收買紗布，並限制各銀錢行莊濫行放款，取締投機國積以後，市面銀根轉緊，各項物價，亦隨之下跌，於是亦陷於停滯狀態中。頃　，在今年七八月間地產交易異常熱鬧時、市價飛漲，至一倍以上，但自九月下半月起，因交易轉趨清稀，故價格並無激漲之象云。</p>

<p>北方兵站基地鳥瞰</p>
<h3>開發龐大的資源　再接再厲增強戰力</h3>
<p>在四南太平洋劇戰聲中，向阿圖島，基斯加島方面推進根據地的美國，居然想利用連結阿拉斯加，阿留申的所謂北方進攻路來　　日本國土，其反攻勢態，頗有不可侮之概，在此緊張情勢之下，北海道，庫頁島的軍事上地位，既然加重，在此種戰意激動之中，北海道就榭立了食糧增產五年計劃，庫頁島方而，也正在趕擬十年開發計劃，期將龐大資源　獻於增强戰力，確保食糧，那兩處本來是資源，食糧的兵站根據地，從此又以軍事據點的地位再向增强戰力，間發資源出發，唐澤內務次官曾往該處一帶視察十天，關於上開計劃的具體化，獲有極大確信歸來，記者隨行，茲將見聞所得，寫成這篇報吿文章</p>
<p>庫頁島</p>
<p>庫頁鳥而積，廣凡三萬六千平方公里，擁有廣大的耕地，奉天的森林，世界的三大魚塲，〇〇噸的煤斤，以及無數地質資源，它負起了決戰兵站的重要的一巽，然而內地的人們，却忽視了這樣的富源，這裏自從滿洲事變起，就以紙漿工業為拓　事業的大宗，成了北進日本的重要據點，旋因中國事變，乃更積極的開發地下資源，以大束亞戰爭為契機，於是就成了推進決戰國策的原動力。</p>
<p>鑛業</p>
<p>庫頁島鑛業中心是煤斤，煤山分散在南北中二大煤山及全島，蘊藏量　〇〇億　，經營煤業的公司，統計有三菱，三井，鐵實等二十五家，生產總額，年約〇〇噸占日本內地總額的百分之〇〇，現在還有許多煤鑛未開，一旦總動員的開採起來，產額當然更其驚人了。庫頁島煤斤當前的最大難關，就是海上輸送力，因而運貨不能如願以賞，目下正在設法改善運輸，配置木造船，不久即可突破種種困難，現在對於儲煤，政府也在覓取萬全對策，衆認百尺竿頭尙須更進一步，整理煤礦公司也是當務之急，一面當然繼續調查未開發鑛區，再檢討既開發鑛區。</p>
<p>工業</p>
<p>庫頁島的工業齊是以製紙紙漿為　興之始，製紙四億餘萬磅，（占全國生產額五分之一）木漿四十餘萬噸（占全國四成有餘）這不得不歸功於王子製紙公司，但是可惜其他部門的工業，頗多尙未振興的，昭和十一年，開設了一家樺太製糖公司，現在島內消費的食糖，有三分之一，可以自供自給，今後尙有增產之望。現在庫頁島工業的中心，是人這煤油，　稍十四年創立的四海岸三菱煤油化學工業　以內幌煤為原料成績斐然，最近復有東海岸的棒太人造煤油所成立，資金四千萬圓，毎年可以生產煤油〇〇噸，前途發展，未可限量，庫頁島的煤油　額，於是占了全國〇之一的重要地位。</p>
<p>林業</p>
<p>近年森林</p>
<p>因受山火，虫害，略形不振，自前年起，着手十五年造林計劃，王子製紙公司，水來是林業的最大消費者，但因其生產限制與海上輸送力的關係，故而林業尙有再檢討的必要。</p>
<p>水產業</p>
<p>世界三大漁場的庫頁島之水產業，所獲水產魚類，十分之七作為肥料，十分之三為糧食，庫頁島政廳的水產行政，獎勵水產與增植水產，均為舊　，但是新的重要問題，就是要統一合併現存於島內的樺太漁業，樺太海獸興業兩公司，樺太海產物統制協會的三種組織，以便展開統一的水產事業，作為骨地食糧政策的一　。</p>
<p>農業</p>
<p>庫頁島物資類稱豐足，唯有島內食糧不足，食糧自給一點，目前猶有困難，農地狹小，佃農不多，要求食糧自供自給，必須增加農地與農民，最近當局已經派員調査，亟盼其能夠改進，其次，應該考慮的，就是午，馬，猪，鷄等牲畜的增殖，農業指導者的準備，農耕道路的建設，農村金融的補助，特別是對於担任開發新地的農佃，須要帮助他們建築房屋，購辦燃料，家畜，常地一般人都希望每一戶能帮助六千圓，則補助於農業者，實非淺詳，島內的食糧自給，是當局的開發計劃之中心，目下正在樹立一個北海道與庫頁島一體的食糧計劃，依存其他　市的條例，將被摒棄。</p>
<p>以上是各種產業的　觀，為促進開發而於前年七月成立的樺太開發會社，它的成　，還不十分顯著，既為國策公司，這就是值得注目的了，希望他能比較的強化公司首腦　物的配置，矯正官　化之弊，同時要超脫利害觀念，向增強戰力的最大目標邁進。（企靑譯自九月十六日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>故都文化界動態</h3>
<p>文學代表行踪</p>
<p>前些日子中國的文學家曾經派過代表到日本去出席第二次的「大東亞文學者大會」。華北的代表沈啓先等一行在閉會後就已回到北京了。獨有陳　張我軍二氏和華中的代表九人因為受日本文學報國會的招待，到各地去參觀，又到滿洲國去觀光，一直到本月十三日方囘到北京，下榻北京飯店。當日的晚間還由華北作家協會設宴洗　華北作家協會的柳　光幹事長甚至於有一篇極其動人的演購，總算是時代文學家的一塲交歡宴。所說華中的代表團在其完了，交際任務之後已經囘到南方去了，而華北的代表也將於本月二卞日出席北京中國新文化建設協曾華北作家協會，中國生活文化協會，和中國文化學會四個文化團體所發起的聯合座談會，報吿在日開會經過及遊歷所得的印象和感想，總可以大大的出了一次風頭。</p>
<p>油畫展覽</p>
<p>藝術家似乎都是很散漫的。然而也不盡然。中　油畫會就是幾個不喜歡散漫的油畫家所組織的團體。創立至今已經三個年頭了。為着紀念起見，就借了中央公園的董事會舉行丁一次三週週紀念展覽會所陳列的一共有三部。第一部是北京愛好油畫的人的作品，其中得獎者有三人；陳宇濱，高克開。當國慧。第二部是會員的作品，特別是唐國唧，張振化，楊凝等的佳作。第三部最為貴重，是國立藝術專門學校和李書齊氏所藏的近代西洋名家作品和國內已故畫家的遺作二十餘件，都是不可多得的精品，展覽會巳經於本月十四日開幕。展覽一週，連日參觀的人很多，是藝術家大活動的一個機會。</p>
<p>小學教員可憐</p>
<p>北京近來有句流行的話謂之「四賤。」四賤者何？第一椒食鹽，第二是電車費，第三是郵費，第四就是小學敎員。這四者之中，食鹽雖是不値錢的束四，最近却因為某種原因而大形缺乏，居然買不到，而且也已經漲了價。需車費實在是賤得不能再賤了，然而最近也從一毛錢漲到一毛五分。郵費總算是沒有什麽變動，然而比較事變前郤並不是沒有漲，還有小學敎員的薪水遠保持幾年前的原價，最高的每月八十元，低者僅能領到五十五元，尚不及不個傭人的收入。在這百物昂貴的當兒，這樣的待遇實在是太苦了。怪不得許多小學敎員都放棄了粉筆生涯而另求謀生之道去了。然而走了的雖然是走國，新來的也還不算少。原因是中學畢業的人除了當小學教員之外實在沒有任何其他的能力。據說這些受過中等教育的人就是一種士大夫，這「士來文質彬彬，連一陣秋風都經不起，更那裏談得到勞作？所以只好到小學再去謀「糊口」之術，然而現在是連「糊口」都發生了問題。每斤米貴到四五元，八十元薪水　　不上一個入半月的吃，如何能「糊口？」能養家？因此，最近就發明了一個新的辦法，叫做「募集補助金，」即向學生請求，額外的津貼，換言之，就是　緣的一種。不幸，因為這種「寡集」是「額外的，」就惹起了有心整頓風化的教育當局的注意，結果「北京特別市教育局，」就「以本巿市立小學敎員　集生活補助金，有　教育方針，」下令制止，而各校也就「遵令照辦，即日停止向學生　集了。」不過已經募集的，沒有法于發達，就特別開恩，「不再索還，」（以上均引本月十七日新北京報語）聽說制止這種有傷風化的「募集」一後當局正在想方法來改善小學教員的待遇，不過要募到什麽時候，要如何的改善，我捫就不知道了。（九月二十日）</p>
<p>國民論壇</p>
<h3>急待改良的警政</h3>
<p>其一</p>
<p>政治要上軌道，需要執政者用賢明的條例方法，施行到民間各處去，執行監視條例方法之實施者即謂之公務人員，所以有了良好的條例方法必須有正直淸明的公務員去執行，否則即使有了良好的條例方法而被汚濫的公務人員濫行，則其害不僅仍使民衆受苦，抑且將藐視政府的法令，而對執政者之不信任，所以我們要求修明的政治，必須不可忽略了執行條例方法的實施者—公務員—是否是正直淸明，而能盡上意下達切直的惠施到民問的任務。</p>
<p>華者所見不廣，不得至窮鄕僻野以體騐全國各處之公務人員之成績如何，然愚以為上海即可代表全國中之最佳者，何則？因爲愈是入口衆多的地方，要顧到羣衆的指摘，即便不良的公務人員也得有所避忌，語云「君子暗室不欺」意即人少則可任意所為，惟君子可不欺，若在人口衆多之地則雖小人也不易胡為矣，而上海人口的密度居全國首位，故愚意上海可表示全國之最佳者。</p>
<p>所謂公務人員凡是在國家機關辦事的人都包括在內，不過在戰爭期內最多與民衆接觸的是警務人員，路上進出交通要道上都有他們固定的位置，在承平時他們的職務僅是維　治安，保障善良人民之安全，他們根本立塲是應與善良民衆切實合作，誠意援助，但今日，因為政府欲取締投機囤積安定民生關係，曾告佈多種物資予以適當合現的處置辦法，若公家收賈限制移，限價出售。以及必須登記等等，政府要規立這些法令當然是顧全大局安定民生的必要設施，醫務人員自當絕對服從遵守執行，決不能有所徇就，可是，事實却大謬不然，上海的警務人員是這樣的，我想凡是居住在上海而耳目淸明的人一定不會否認的，上海如此，其他窮鄉僻野，暗室寡人的處更可見了，由是常此以往，政府根本的政策既不能實施，而人民更將怨憤不安，前途如何，實不堪，想</p>
<p>無病的呻吟是要不得的　句是·依誤仍誤。有　人的禍患待發而不知不言視為本來如此是更要不得的，一夭下之患最不可為者；名為治平無事而其實有不測之憂」。希望執事者以國家民族為前題，幡然下決心重振警政，則國家幸甚，人民幸甚（許鴻笙）</p>
<p>其二</p>
<p>上海的市民對於特區的警察，一從前的巡捕」發生好感的可說百無一得，這是什麽道理呢，因為平日所見到警察的行為，太使人發生一種不好的印象了。中國民衆素抱祗掃自己門前雪，不管他家瓦上霜之態，以致造成此輩警察目無法紀的行爲，我想要消滅此等行為祗有：</p>
<p>提高待遇，務須安定日常生活，使他們不想發意外之財，安份守己。</p>
<p>所有的警　施以精神訓練，務須以服務社會為宗旨，對於人民須以勸誘方法，使人民發生好感，互相合作。</p>
<p>淘汰頭腦陳舊兇惡無理以及年老無用之輩，起用年輕力强受過相當敎育方為合格，或創辦警察學校，倘遇警察不足數額之時由校方負責補充。</p>
<p>倘有不法行為，當即嚴重處罰。</p>
<p>容納民衆公意，倘有報告等情，査有實據，當即撤職查辦。</p>
<p>委派秘密巡查，調查警察職務，按日報告，以便賞罰。以上諸條不知當局諸公，以為善否？（葉任善。</p>
<h3>推行「敬師金運動」</h3>
<p>— 堅君</p>
<p>九月二十八日「敎師節」，這對敎師確實可以說是一種敬意和熱忱，可是我以為在這生活維艱的苦難時期中除了給他們以精神上的安慰以外，更應有積極的通一步的行動方能切實地表現出一般學生對他們的安慰，這就是我之所以要提倡有「敬師金」的動機和目的了。</p>
<p>我以為「敬師金」的貢獻最好是由學生們水身自動發起，完全出乎眞誠和自願，他們最奸能夠將自己平時所節省下來的糖果費或娛樂費等拿出一部分或全部來作一個敎師的安慰—雖然，事實上或許有一部人已因為生活之不安定而沒有這種節省能力，但我相信這不過僅僅是一小部分而已，即使自已沒有，但我認為他們如果眞的肯爲他們的教師熱心地盡一次力量的話，那他們是一定有辦法的，他們很可以向親友們去募捐。</p>
<p>至於呈送的方式和手續，我以為最好的就是由各學生將各人為教師而捐得之款項交由各校之事務處辦理　交事宜，因為這樣一方面既可免除推却或接受等麻煩，而另一方面亦可免有「不均」之弊此運動若能順利進行，我相信敎師們雖不能說得上「獲益甚大」，但至少亦可以說上一句「不無小補」吧。</p>

        <h1>1943.09.28</h1>
<h3>Trends of the Chongqing Regime (Part 1) – A Dialogue Between Person A and Person B</h3>
<p>A: Have you read the "On Overall Peace" commentary in the *Shen Bao* Weekly Review from September 26th?</p>
<p>B: Yes, I have. I strongly agree with the point that the key to the success or failure of overall peace today lies with Chongqing. However, I am too unfamiliar with the recent situation in Chongqing, and I would like to ask for your insights…</p>
<p>A: Not long ago, Chongqing held the "11th Plenary Session of the Kuomintang," followed by the "Second Session of the Third National Political Council," where I heard they discussed many so-called "major events." Please present your questions, and I will answer them with what I know, how does that sound?</p>
<p>B: First, I would like to ask, the main obstacle to overall peace today is naturally Chongqing's dragging on the war. What is the strength of Chongqing's war effort?</p>
<p>A: To get a more accurate answer, this needs to be observed in conjunction with international relations, internal economy, and public sentiment.</p>
<p>B: How about starting with the military aspect?</p>
<p>A: As it stands, Chongqing's military strength has clearly been greatly weakened, and it also contains many crises. Not long ago, Rogov, the head of the Soviet TASS Chongqing branch, published an essay criticizing the Chongqing regime, in which he said regarding the Chongqing army: "…The reorganization of the Chongqing army has begun to encounter resistance in secret… The military reforms aimed at training new cadres and strengthening discipline have not been completed. As a result, the combat effectiveness of the army has been weakened, and it is even more dependent on the supply of British and American arms…" He also said: "Chongqing does not lack manpower, but the army does not have regular replenishment, no sufficient trained reserves, and not even organized civilian conscription. Even to this day, the ordinary conscription laws have not been fully implemented, and the personnel replenishment obtained by the army is mostly unsuitable for military service…"</p>
<p>B: But wasn't Chongqing long proclaiming the "new soldier training" under Hu Zongnan's training, preparing for a general counteroffensive?</p>
<p>A: True, we have heard of that too. However, Rogov also criticized Chongqing's new soldier training, saying: "Foreign military observers who have visited the Chongqing army all agree that the soldiers are very tenacious and hard-working on the battlefield, and do not pay attention to food and clothing, but the commanding officers are extremely backward in military and technical training, the equipment of the army is also very low, and the organization and management of the army is extremely imperfect." He also specifically pointed out: "One of the shortcomings of the Chongqing army is the lack of effective unified leadership and coordinated operations on various battlefields: internal friction and suspicion between generals cannot but reduce the combat effectiveness and discipline of the army."</p>
<p>B: Even criticism from those sympathetic to Chongqing is not overly severe, which shows that Chongqing's ability to drag on the war has reached the "end of its rope." So, what is the truth?</p>
<p>A: To observe the current Chongqing politics, it is important to grasp three major centers: first, international relations, second, the Chongqing-Communist relationship, and third, the trend of public opinion. Integrating these aspects for research will make it easy to infer the direction of Chongqing. However, when we observe the trends of the Chongqing regime and estimate its strength, of course we must not underestimate it, but we should not overestimate it either.</p>
<p>Starting with international relations, Chongqing has recently been boasting about being one of the "United Nations Four Powers," on par with Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. However, in reality, Chongqing exists in the contradiction of the opposition between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and its situation is quite difficult. The text of the head of the Soviet TASS branch criticizing Chongqing already shows what the Soviet Union thinks of Chongqing. On the contrary, it can also be seen that the Chongqing regime is tending towards a path of complete dependence on the United States and Britain. In addition, the dictatorial nature of the Anglo-American faction in the essence of the Chongqing regime is even more obvious! This point cannot be ignored under any circumstances. The regime that actually becomes an Anglo-American faction represents the interests of Anglo-American imperialism and a few who depend on Britain and the United States, and of course all policies will follow the lead of Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>B: To what extent has the Chongqing-Communist friction issue reached recently?</p>
<p>A: According to the main points of the "11th Plenary Session of the Kuomintang" in Chongqing's resolution on the Communist Party issue, following Chiang's instructions, the Communist Party should repent and earnestly fulfill the four promises, namely, to strive to realize the Three Principles of the People; to abolish the policy of riots and the Redization movement; to abolish the Soviet government and unify the regime; to abolish the Red Army and reorganize it into the "National Revolutionary Army" under the control of the "Military Commission," etc. This measure is entirely aimed at launching a political offensive to make up for the poverty of military preparations, and to buy time for a large-scale campaign to suppress the Communists. The Communist Party, on the other hand, is not showing weakness either, and is preparing to fight back, tit-for-tat. For example, in August, there were armed clashes between the Chongqing and Communist sides in some places. Therefore, in the current stage of the Chongqing-Communist relationship, the longer the friction lasts, the deeper the degree of deterioration. If there were no constraints from the international environment, a large-scale civil war would have broken out long ago.</p>
<p>B: What is the trend of the people under Chongqing's rule being tired of war and alienated?</p>
<p>A: The trend of publications in various places under Chongqing's rule shows the people's situation with being tired of war and alienation. According to statistics from the first half of this year, compared with last year, soft literature has increased to 48%, politics has decreased to 9%, economics has decreased to 4%, history and geography have decreased to 3%, science has decreased to 3%, and those promoting the Three Principles of the People have decreased to 1%. This trend of publications really shows the seriousness of the problem. The higher the prices and the more difficult life is, the more popular soft literature becomes. Currently, among the 32 magazines in Kunming, there are as many as 16 drama publications, and among the 122 books that bookstores in Xi'an applied for review and sale in April of this year, new and old novels account for as many as 115. However, it is clearly insufficient to say that this "worrying" phenomenon is only due to "high prices and difficult life." It is more honest to say that it reflects the people's aversion to war and dissatisfaction with politics.</p>

<h3>Third Anniversary of the Alliance Treaty: Axis Powers Reaffirm Determination; Japan and Germany Recognize the New Fascist Government of Italy</h3>
<p>Tokyo, September 27 (Central News Agency) – On the third anniversary of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, the Japanese government, simultaneously with its ally Germany, formally recognized the Italian Fascist Republic government headed by Mussolini. The Fascist Republic government was formed on the 23rd by Mussolini, who gathered comrades from across the country. Mussolini himself serves as Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, and on the 27th, he also assumed the chairmanship of the government. Now that the government has been recognized by Japan and Germany, the following facts have been established: The Italian Fascist Republic government is now the sole legitimate government of Italy, and therefore, the Japanese government's attitude towards the betrayal of the Badoglio regime is essentially one of denial. At the same time, the existence of the House of Savoy as the Italian royal family is also denied. In the future, Mussolini will be qualified to have the qualifications of head of state as the head of the government. In addition, the existing international treaties between Japan, Germany, and Italy do not need to go through other special procedures, but will be inherited and fulfilled by the government immediately. From now on, the relationship between Japan, Germany, and Italy has been established as more clear and solid than before.</p>
<p>Tokyo, September 27 (Central News Agency) – On September 27, the third anniversary of the establishment of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu hosted a luncheon at his residence at 12:30 p.m. to celebrate the occasion, inviting the German ambassador Speer and the ambassadors of other allied countries such as Romania and Hungary, and reaffirmed the determination to jointly carry out the war. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu also delivered a speech at the luncheon, outlining the Japanese government's countermeasures against the Mussolini government and forcefully stating its vow to work with its allies to defeat Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Berlin, September 27 (Central News Agency) – After the Badoglio regime of Italy broke faith and withdrew from the Tripartite Pact, the anti-Axis side used this as an opportunity to sow discord among the three allied countries, launching a major propaganda campaign. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was scheduled to exchange statements with Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu via broadcast on the 27th, the third anniversary of the alliance treaty, to reaffirm the spirit of the Tripartite Pact. On the evening of the 26th, German Foreign Ministry officials declared in this regard: When the Badoglio regime of Italy betrayed the Tripartite Pact, the governments of Japan and Germany simultaneously issued statements declaring that the Tripartite Pact would continue to exist. Now that Chairman Mussolini has returned and organized a new government based on new laws, it is of course necessary to reaffirm the treaty and spirit of the Tripartite Pact. Furthermore, on the occasion of the third anniversary of the establishment of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, the other allied countries will also confirm the existence of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy and the alliance treaties signed between the countries, in order to shatter the false propaganda of the anti-Axis side. Therefore, to reaffirm the Tripartite Pact again to show the world, all the signatory countries must participate unanimously, without exception. It is feared that not only Japan and Germany, but all signatory countries will reiterate the content and purpose of the Tripartite Pact through appropriate institutions or foreign ministers.</p>
<p>The National Government Authorities Express Recognition</p>
<p>Nanjing, September 27 (Central News Agency) – The Italian Fascist Republic government has been formally established under the leadership of the Iron Fist Prime Minister Mussolini. He assumed the chairmanship of the new government in the capital Rome, and the Italian national system has therefore changed. The Axis countries of Japan and Germany have expressed formal recognition, which proves that the Axis powers of the three countries are still united and inseparable. The Japanese government's recognition on the anniversary of the Tripartite Pact is particularly significant. A spokesperson for our government also told Central News Agency reporters on the 28th that the government will formally recognize the legitimate government of the Italian Fascist Republic. Relations between China and Italy cannot change due to Badoglio's surrender. The solidarity of the Axis countries will become more solid, and they will jointly advance towards the path of overthrowing the United States and Britain and achieving communism. The statement of our government's spokesperson can be regarded as an expression of our government's recognition of the new Fascist Republic government.</p>
<p>Exchange of Congratulatory Telegrams between Japanese and German Foreign Ministers</p>
<p>Tokyo, September 27 (Central News Agency) – Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop exchanged congratulatory telegrams on September 27, the third anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Pact. The original text of Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's congratulatory telegram to the German Foreign Minister is as follows: "Today, I am delighted to celebrate the third anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Pact. I extend my deepest congratulations to Your Excellency. Japan and Germany are currently engaged in a great war of self-defense, and are simultaneously engaged in building a just order in the Greater East Asia and European regions, respectively. I am extremely pleased to see this. The joint declaration previously issued by the governments of Japan and Germany is of great significance. I believe that Japan and Germany will cooperate closely and surely achieve final victory."</p>
<p>Tokyo, September 27 (Central News Agency) – German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop sent a telegram congratulating Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu. The telegram reads as follows: "Today, I am delighted to celebrate the third anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Pact. I am deeply gratified to recall the armies of the allied countries jointly confronting the enemy and reaping honorable and great victories. Only such great victories can give the peoples of the allied countries an unwavering belief in the future and in their happiness and freedom."</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Broadcasts to Germany, Moving Forward Hand in Hand to Transform the World</h3>
<p>Tokyo, September 27 (Central News Agency) – Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu held a historic exchange broadcast with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop at the Tokyo Broadcasting Station at 7:30 p.m. today, revealing the firm determination of the Axis countries to complete the war. The main points of his speech are as follows: Although the United States and Britain have used all kinds of cunning tricks to seduce the Badoglio regime into betraying the Axis, the Axis alliance will never waver because of this. The alliance treaty shines as brightly as the sun and moon, illuminating the path of the Axis countries towards final victory. Fueled by ardent friendship, the success of Hitler's rescue of Mussolini to a safe area can be considered a miracle. On this anniversary of the alliance, Mussolini assumed the position of Chairman of the Italian Fascist Republic government. The Japanese government and the allied countries have quickly recognized this. Therefore, under the leadership of Chairman Mussolini, the new Italy will once again strive for a bright future, to wash away the humiliation and disgrace caused by the unconditional surrender forced by Britain and the United States. This is what we hope for.</p>
<p>We, as constituent members of the interwoven composition of nations, ethnicities, and the world, naturally enjoy the inherent right to coexist with other countries and flags. Because this inherent right to survive is already under threat, we have no choice but to take self-defense measures and possess the resolute determination to carry out the war and strive for victory. Over the past three years, the Axis powers have countered the enemy's counterattacks, crushing their forces everywhere in the East and West. Germany, in Europe, has established a great fortress of Europe with the allied countries, and has used a brave and decisive offensive spirit to reduce the enemy. Japan has also countered the enemy's resistance in various aspects of Greater East Asia, and is gradually destroying their war power. Therefore, the purpose of the alliance treaty is to realize justice in the world. We have already achieved glorious victories, and its success is beyond doubt. Japan has built a mutually cooperative, stable, and prosperous system in East Asia, which is in line with justice and the inevitable demands of the East Asian peoples. We are now fighting to the end to achieve this noble purpose. For many years, the countries of the United States and Britain have invaded Asia, viewing it as a colony or semi-colony to be exploited at will. Their usual policy is to divide and rule Asia. We who uphold the right to survive are seeking to liberate East Asia from the invasion of the United States and Britain, so we must first eliminate this invasive and exploitative force. The United States and Britain have not yet abandoned their ambitions, and are still trying to restore their old state of domination over Asia, and are continuing to challenge and counterattack Japan. However, the fierce fighting of the Japanese army and navy has completely shattered their ambitions. Liberating Asia and building a new world of coexistence and co-prosperity in East Asia is our common goal. The Republic of China has been liberated, and is already building and restoring China in East Asia. Thailand has developed into an autonomous and independent power. Burma has also completely declared independence. The Philippines will also be independent. India should also be liberated. In this way, the Asian peoples will all have their place. Therefore, this war is not only a war for world justice, but also a war for the revival of Asia. The Asian countries and nations must fight this war to the end with the European Axis powers in order to secure the threatened right to survive. Japan's spirit of courageous fighting in East Asia and the spirit of the courageous fighting of Germany and other European allied countries in Europe are the same in meaning. The aim of the Axis allies to build a world of justice in Eurasia will be achieved by the final victory of the Axis powers. This is already very clear.</p>
<h3>Minister Aoki's Address Celebrating Burmese Independence Fully Demonstrates the Japanese Spirit of Justice</h3>
<p>Tokyo, September 27 (Central News Agency) – Various Japanese national movement organizations held a grand celebration of Burmese independence at the Greater East Asia Hall here at 1:00 p.m. on the 27th, with many representatives from various national movement organizations attending, creating a very enthusiastic atmosphere. Japanese Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia specially took time out of his busy schedule to attend and deliver a congratulatory speech. The main points of his speech are as follows: The declaration of independence by Burma denies British rule over East Asia and is a major advance in the construction of a new order in Greater East Asia. It marks a new era in world history. The Greater East Asia War has now entered the decisive stage from the war stage, and the enemy's counterattacks are becoming increasingly fierce. Burma's declaration of independence during the Great War fully demonstrates the Japanese spirit of justice, allowing all nations to have their place and all people to live in peace. It is also clear evidence of the Japanese government's commitment to its promises. Furthermore, the announcement yesterday of Japan's recognition of the incorporation of various states and provinces into Burmese territory is sufficient to prove Japan's attitude of righteousness and magnanimity. It is believed that the entire Burmese people will recognize this attitude of Japan, and that all the peoples of East Asia and the world will also express their approval of this just measure taken by Japan. However, all of us Greater East Asian peoples must remember that if the Greater East Asia War does not achieve victory, it will be difficult for the countries of Greater East Asia to achieve autonomy and independence, and it will also be difficult to build a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, the independence of Burma can only be fully and permanently guaranteed after the Greater East Asia War is completed. Japan will always support the independence of Burma and fully cooperate with its future development. It is firmly believed that the Burmese people will be able to carry out the spirit of the Japan-Burma alliance, strengthen their cooperation with Japan, and strive for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>

<p>Shanghai, Central News Agency – Italian Consul General in Shanghai, Colonel Meritte, wrote to Japanese Consul General Yano on the 16th, expressing his denial of the Badoglio regime and his absolute support for the Fascist Party.

<h3>Ministry of Justice Issues Order to Subordinates to Report Economic Criminals in Order to Curb Speculation and Hoarding</h3>
<p>Nanjing, September 27 (Central News Agency) – In order to stabilize prices and secure people's livelihoods, the National Government has successively promulgated various laws and regulations to punish economic criminals, in order to combat speculation and hoarding. It is learned that, in order to urge its subordinates to earnestly implement these regulations, the Ministry of Judicial Administration has issued a special order to all courts and agencies that, in the future, prosecutors should inspect and seriously report on economic criminals at any time, and should not shift responsibility to administrative agencies and voluntarily abandon their duties. Trial judges should be especially careful and avoid giving cause for criticism. It is stipulated that, starting from October 10, 1943, those who violate the Provisional Regulations for Punishing the Crime of Hoarding Major Commodities, the Provisional Regulations for Buying Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth, the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Hindrance to the New Legal Tender, and Articles 16 to 20 of the Wartime Special Criminal Law should immediately report the full case file and the original copy of the judgment for special filing once the punishment or judgment is confirmed.

If, in the case of the above-mentioned economic crimes, there are any instances of those in charge abusing their power and deliberately making loopholes, the responsible personnel will be severely punished upon verification, and the heads of the respective agencies will also be held responsible. Furthermore, the ministry, regarding the fact that the courts under its jurisdiction have failed to earnestly implement the Provisional Measures for the Imposition of Fines during Wartime, has once again ordered all courts to strictly abide by the provisions of the regulations and earnestly handle cases involving the imposition of fines.</p>
<h3>Personnel Choices for the Cotton Industry Professional Committee Have Been Decided</h3>

The direct acquisition plan is being drafted and is expected to be completed within days, and then the acquisition will begin. The acquisition method will generally follow the acquisition method for wheat, with members of the various trade associations affiliated with the Sino-Japanese Joint Association responsible for the acquisition. In the past, the method of dividing acquisition areas between China and Japan was implemented for acquisition matters. It is reported that this method is still adopted in principle, but in practice, both China and Japan are free to acquire. However, the managers are still responsible for their respective areas under the jurisdiction of both China and Japan.</p>

<h3>Soviet Troops Use Fog Cover to Attempt to Cross the Dnieper River; Fierce Fighting West of Bryansk</h3>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to official sources: Soviet troops attempted to cross the Dnieper River again near Bryansk on Sunday morning, achieving only partial success. The Soviet troops used heavy fog as cover, but lost control of their movements in the fog during the battle. German troops penetrated the Soviet lines, and isolated Soviet tank units were unexpectedly destroyed. Soviet reinforcements transported by motorcycle were also completely routed.</p>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency correspondent Colonel Hammer): On Saturday, the Soviet army continued its efforts to break through the German defenses at various points along the Eastern Front. The Soviet army launched a large-scale landing operation at the Kuban bridgehead in an attempt to achieve the aforementioned objective. In the central Dnieper region, Red Army paratroopers simultaneously landed behind German lines, but all Soviet attempts were thwarted by German defenders. The Soviet army hoped that the weather conditions in the central and southern parts of the Eastern Front would deteriorate, hindering German operations, but this hope was dashed. The war in various regions of the Eastern Front has not eased. The Soviet army is not only engaging divisions but also entire army corps in combat, and continues to suffer extremely heavy casualties. The Soviet army's "offensive for bread" has developed into a large-scale war of attrition. For the sake of survival, the Soviet army will have to continue this war, regardless of its irreparable losses.</p>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: The seesaw battle in the Chernikov district is currently raging. Soviet forces are using extremely powerful tanks and infantry to maintain their supply lines, resulting in heavy losses.

<h3>Argentina Expresses Neutrality</h3>

<h3>Germany Adopts New Submarine Tactics in the Atlantic; Dönitz Offensive Revived</h3>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since Grand Admiral Dönitz, commander of the German submarine fleet, took office as commander-in-chief of the Navy at the beginning of this year, German submarine warfare has become significantly more active. The so-called "Dönitz Offensive" has caused fear among the British and Americans. However, as British and American anti-submarine defenses reached a peak, the results gradually diminished after April, leading to a gradual decline in German submarine activity. The German High Command announced on the 24th its long-dormant major submarine victory, indicating that German submarines have re-launched their offensive. Although the type and performance of the new weapons used to achieve this victory have not yet been revealed, reports suggest that this submarine war not only used new weapons but also adopted new tactics for the first time. German submarines have always primarily targeted transport ships, concentrating all their efforts on them in each attack and not attacking escort ships. However, this method was discovered by the British and Americans and could no longer be used. Therefore, German personnel, led by Grand Admiral Dönitz and other highly intelligent individuals, researched new tactics, and finally achieved this offensive strategy. This time, emulating Japanese submarine tactics, they focused all their efforts on attacking warships first, and then attacking transport ships. When a submarine approached a convoy, it first attacked the escort destroyer fleet, striving to destroy the destroyers with unwavering determination. After that, the submarine would turn its sharp edge toward the transport ships, launching a fierce attack on transport ships that the escort ships were unable to defend. As a result, a major victory was achieved, sinking twelve British and American escort ships, inflicting a major blow on the British and Americans. The British and Americans seem to be extremely embarrassed by this. The new offensive by German submarines, using new weapons and adopting new tactics, has just begun. It is said that the German high command has great confidence in this, and Dönitz's contribution, after six months of dormancy, will become increasingly active in the Atlantic, inflicting a heavy blow on the British and American transportation network.</p>
<h3>Stettinius Appointed U.S. Under Secretary of State</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Reuters report from Washington: The British Broadcasting Corporation's correspondent in the United States, Barkerway, claimed that Stettinius's appointment as Under Secretary of State after Welles has caused great surprise among Americans. Washington political figures have welcomed the appointment, believing that Stettinius can reorganize the State Department with his experience and talent and implement new policies. It is also generally believed that Stettinius's appointment as Under Secretary of State confirms that the Lend-Lease system will become one of the important aspects of American post-war policy. Welles's future position remains unknown.</p>
<h3>Soviet Representative for the British, American, and Soviet Foreign Ministers Conference Decided</h3>
<p>Moscow, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Soviet Foreign Ministry announced yesterday that it has appointed Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky to represent the Soviet government at the upcoming meeting of the British, American, and Soviet foreign ministers to be held in Algiers.</p>
<h3>British and American Forces Launch Reconnaissance Offensive in Italian Mountain Area, Repelled by Heavy German Artillery Fire</h3>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German News Agency's special correspondent in Italy, Bollener, stated that in the Salerno area and further east in the Potenza area as far as the Gulf of Manfredonia, British and American activities in the past 24 hours have been limited to reconnaissance attacks. In the focal points northwest of Salerno and north of Montecorvino in the past few days, the British and American forces have conserved their weak infantry and focused on using reinforced artillery units to attack high-ground German positions. On the front lines north of Contursi and Potenza, small American and British reconnaissance units cautiously advanced towards German forward positions on September 25, but were repulsed everywhere, suffering heavy casualties. A large American infantry group deployed in the valleys was effectively bombarded by German artillery fire, preventing the implementation of the previously planned American reconnaissance offensive. British and American units tasked with clearing German landmines were subjected to a sudden attack by German vanguards and were either annihilated or captured. German fighter-bombers attacked British and American supply lines, resulting in air combat. Two enemy aircraft were shot down, while the German aircraft completed their missions without any losses.</p>
<h3>German Head of State Declares Independence for Norway, Promoting Policies to Permanently Safeguard European Security</h3>
<p>Oslo, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: The German Commissioner for Norway, Terboven, yesterday read the following declaration from the German Head of State to Norwegian Prime Minister Quisling and officials at the Norwegian National Assembly: The German people are currently engaged in a mortal struggle with Bolshevism and the financiers who support it. The Jewish alliance of England and America in Moscow is launching a large-scale offensive against Western culture with mechanized forces, and the price paid by the English and American capitalists is "Europe." The German people have been at the forefront, sacrificing enormous manpower and material resources, deeply aware that this war will not only determine the fate of Germany and the German nation for centuries to come, but will also affect the entire future of the European continent. Therefore, they are willing to bear heavy responsibilities now and in the future, and are confident that this determination will guarantee victory and be a prerequisite for the pacification of Europe. Only after the implementation of pacification policies can Europe contribute all its strength to spiritual and material construction. In the process of completing this task, the German Head of State has decided, after achieving victory, to build a national socialist Norway that enjoys independence and freedom, ensuring that Norway can permanently safeguard European security in an elevated European society. Only such a society can ensure and guarantee the security of Europe. Furthermore, political figures here believe that the Head of State's declaration is not only a definition of the main political affairs implemented by the Norwegian National Assembly for three years, which is based on belief, but also an unprecedented announcement. The Norwegian National Government has always been loyal to this policy.</p>

<h3>Analysis of Soviet War Potential (Part 2)</h3>
<p>Since the start of the German-Soviet war, more than two years have passed. Looking at the movements of the Soviet army, two tendencies are immediately apparent. 1. The recent efforts of the Soviet army towards modernization, and 2. The Soviet army's tendency towards revivalism. However, these two contradictory tendencies are not absolutely opposed. It is because of these contradictions that they can be unified. From a military point of view, they play an important role in strengthening the Soviet army's resistance.</p>
<p>Reinvigoration of the Soviet Army</p>
<p>Regarding the heavy blows suffered by the Soviet army at the beginning of the war, and the reasons why the Soviet Union was on the verge of collapse, are now clear and need not be repeated. Although the Soviet army had a highly mechanized and massive people's army, the leadership, misled by the glories of the civil war, neglected the operation of the latest combat techniques and relied solely on the morale of the combatants, which led to this result.</p>
<p>Of course, the morale of the combatants is the most important thing and the most important factor in resistance, which is beyond doubt. However, facing the highly mechanized German army, which was well-versed in ideal and cutting-edge tactics, the rough tactical views of the Soviet army's leadership collapsed vulnerably, pushing the Soviet Union into a major crisis.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Supreme Commander of the Soviet Army, Stalin, decided to thoroughly reorganize the Soviet army's leadership during the winter battles of 1941-42. The one who boldly and frankly demanded the change of the Soviet army's leadership, representing the world of public opinion, was the Ukrainian writer, and current Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Korniychuk.</p>
<p>Korniychuk's play, "The Front," from August 24th to 27th, caused an unusual reaction in all quarters. "The Front" is a literary work of the highest value, but it has even greater significance as a tactical [unclear]. Korniychuk said in "The Front" that it is not enough to simply demand courage from soldiers. Civil war heroes who do not understand the complex outlines of modern tactics are not qualified to carry out the war against Germany, which requires the highest technology and intelligence, and demanded that these "old soldiers" be removed from the Soviet army's leadership. Promote young officers with modern knowledge who understand what modern warfare is.</p>
<p>At the same time, Korniychuk demanded that the Soviet army, from the upper echelons to the rank and file, must have "knowledge of using first-class combat technology." The factory director who appears in the play is a thorough technician, pointing out that "the public respects and hopes for leaders with knowledge and keen insight."</p>
<p>The Pravda wrote a special editorial commenting on the play, stating: "In the Soviet army, commanders without talent, even if they rely on their past achievements and courage, cannot but withdraw from the position of leadership." This argument clearly reflects Stalin's intentions.</p>
<p>Thus, since last year, generals such as Voroshilov, Timoshenko, Budyonny, and Shaposhnikov, who had occupied positions in the Soviet army's leadership, were forced to withdraw from the front lines, and new and energetic commanders who understood modern tactics and respected technology successively occupied senior positions in the Soviet army's leadership.</p>
<p>For example, the new Chief of the General Staff of the Soviet Army, Marshal Alexander Vasilevsky, the commander of the Leningrad [unclear], General Eremenko, the commander of the Volkhov Front, General Meretskov, the commander of the Kalinin Front, General Maxim Purkayev (who seems to have recently been transferred to the commander of the Far Eastern Front), the commander of the Don Front, General Rokossovsky, the commander of the Southwestern Front, General Nikolai Vatutin, the commander of the Southern Front, General Malinovsky, the commander of the North Caucasus Front, Lieutenant General Maslennikov, the commander of the Voronezh Front, General Fyodor Golikov, the Chief Marshal of the Soviet Air Force, Novikov, and the Chief Marshal of the Artillery, Nikolai Voronov, are all around forty years old. Other army commanders, division commanders, etc., are mostly young people around thirty [unclear].</p>
<p>The above facts not only mean that the age of the Soviet army's lineup has returned to youth, but also that the Soviet army's combat effectiveness is not the same. This can be clearly seen in the Soviet army's counter-offensive in the winter of 1942-43 and the Soviet army's summer offensive since July 5th this year. Stalin disregarded all external considerations, gradually promoted new commanders, and ordered old and senile commanders to withdraw, constantly instilling a fresh [unclear] atmosphere within the Soviet army, which is a material that explains the "Asian mystery" of the Soviet army's resistance.</p>
<p>Unification of the Command System</p>
<p>The next important change in the Soviet army was the unification of the command system due to the abolition of the military commissar system. On October 9th last year, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet issued a decree on "the unification of the command system and the abolition of the military commissar system in the Soviet army," which simply and clearly explained the urgent need to establish the unification of the command system.</p>
<p>The military commissar system was created to monitor the former Tsarist Russian officers who accounted for a large proportion of the Soviet army's leadership during the civil war. At that time, when Soviet army commanders issued orders, they had to be countersigned by the military committee. As a result, the Soviet army's command system was completely dualistic.</p>
<p>Later, after the end of the civil war, the political education of the Soviet army was strengthened, and as a result of the so-called Bolshevik education, the political education of the Soviet army commanders was greatly improved. During the Soviet-Finnish War, the military commissar system was once abolished and then restored, and it continued to exist for a year and a half during the German-Soviet War. However, with the progress of the war, many new and promising commanders with rich experience in modern warfare emerged, and the Soviet army made remarkable progress in both political and military aspects.</p>
<p>On the other hand, military commissars and political workers have raised their military significance and accumulated rich experience in modern warfare. Some of them have already served as commanders on the front lines. Many others can immediately become commanders after a certain amount of military training. As a result, the basis on which the military commissar system could exist has completely disappeared. If the military commissar system is allowed to continue to exist, and the command system is split into two, it will become a major obstacle to the implementation of the war. Therefore, it was decided to abolish the military commissar system.</p>
<p>The abolition of the military commissar system does not mean that political education within the Soviet army is no longer needed. It is because the political consciousness of the Soviet army commanders has greatly improved, and the army has [unclear] grown to the point where it can bear all the responsibilities on military and political issues. That is, the former military commissars and political workers who had the qualifications of internal commanders have been appointed as commanders, and others have also been transformed into political [unclear] of the commanders, in addition to undertaking the political education of the former Soviet army, they are also trained as commanders.</p>
<p>Regarding the above situation, as the "Red Star" newspaper said in its editorial: "The work of those engaged in politics is not determined by the number of meetings, reports, and speeches. It is determined by whether they can fully implement the troops' discipline, resistance consciousness, and combat tasks." Therefore, the abolition of the military commissar system in the Soviet army was implemented out of the necessity to most effectively carry out the war against Germany. Because the unification of the command system makes the conduct of operations extremely smooth, and because of the implementation of the same Bolshevik doctrine [unclear], military discipline is further strengthened, resistance is strengthened, and more capable cadres are cultivated, in an attempt to no longer be troubled by the lack of commanders. Therefore, the abolition of the military commissar system and the unification of the command system can be said to be a further development of the Soviet army's resistance.</p>
<p>In short, the abolition of the military commissar system was not abolished because there was no need to carry out political education within the Soviet army. As the Izvestia pointed out, in addition to unifying the command system to smoothly advance the war, it was for the purpose of "forming new reserve commanders." Everything is produced by the necessity of carrying out the war against Germany. Here, we can clearly see that Lenin [unclear] the slogan of "everything for the war" is being concretely implemented in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Revival of Tradition</p>
<p>The former slogan of the Soviet army was "Liberation of the working class of the world." Today, this slogan has become a pipe dream, and what is emblazoned on all the flags of the Soviet army is "For the Motherland" and "For Stalin." That is, the Soviet army believes that there is nothing else in existence today other than "war." Therefore, the Soviet army regards everything necessary for the course of war, and immediately adopts it without hesitation. In that [unclear], the system of the Tsarist era is no longer a problem. The most important of these is the revival of shoulder marks implemented in January of this year. When the Soviet army was created, the Soviet regime abolished shoulder marks as a "symbol of reaction." However, when restoring the "gold shoulder army," the Red Star newspaper said in its editorial: "Shoulder marks are a traditional decoration of the Russian army. The Soviet army is the legitimate successor to the honor of the Russian army. We cannot but use the weapons of our ancestors to inspire morale and take everything necessary to strengthen military discipline. The Soviet army values love for the motherland and respect for historical tradition. Shoulder marks are not simply an accessory to military uniforms, but a symbol of which soldiers boast."</p>
<p>In addition to the restoration of shoulder marks, the system of orderlies for officers has also been restored. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet further issued an order in early July to strengthen the class system of the Soviet army. According to this order, the class classification of the Soviet army is divided into four classes: soldiers, non-commissioned officers, junior officers, and general officers. Before the revolution, the Russian army's class division was divided into three classes: soldiers, non-commissioned officers, and junior officers. Since the creation of the Soviet army, this class system has been abolished. Junior officers are simply referred to as Soviet army commanders, and soldiers are referred to as Soviet army soldiers.</p>
<p>However, the Soviet army authorities, in view of the experience of the two years of the German-Soviet war, have implemented the strengthening of the class system. This, like the revival of shoulder marks, is to enhance the authority of commanders and generals in order to improve military discipline.</p>
<p>On August 11th, the Soviet Navy also adopted this system. The Soviet Union, which calls itself an enemy of the class system, divides classes in the Soviet army and restores the traditions of the old Russian army, also due to the necessity of carrying out the war. In the future, the Soviet Union will resort to all means to win victory.</p>
<p>In summary, the movements of the Soviet army during the two years of the German-Soviet war are one, the progressive tendency to experience the latest technology and effectively carry out the war against Germany, and the revivalist tendency to restore the traditions of the old Russian army. Both of these are carried out in accordance with the fundamental policy of "everything for the war" stipulated by Lenin. In order to improve military technology, military discipline must be strengthened and morale must be boosted. In order to strengthen military discipline and boost morale, new and capable commanders must be continuously [unclear]. The two tendencies are not necessarily opposed. Here, we can seek the key to solving the "Asian mystery" of the Soviet army's resistance. (End of this chapter) (Translation: Allied World News Selection No. 1223)</p>

In addition to submitting it to the Executive Yuan for approval, if rice merchants in the joint regions wish to participate in the preparatory committee, they should comply with the requirements [unclear] stipulated in the Outline. The deadline for the first phase of applications [unclear] is set for October 3rd. It is learned that in the past two days, rice merchants from various regions have enthusiastically collected forms from the third section of the association's procurement and transportation department. The application form requires [unclear] the brand name, the year and month of establishment, whether or not they have joined the local rice trade association, whether [unclear] they are sole proprietorship or partnership, the number of employees, the amount of capital, the amount of working capital, the name, age, and resume of the person in charge, the names of the shareholders, the locations of the branches in various places, the corresponding firms, whether or not there are warehouse and rice milling facilities, the Shanghai liaison office phone number, [unclear] remarks.</p>

<h3>Fang Jiuxia Robbery Case Huang Cifu Sentenced to Death Yesterday Morning's Sentencing Attached Civil Suit Sent to Civil Court</h3>
<p>Huang Cifu robbed four diamond rings from Fang Jiuxia Jewelry Store on Nanjing Road on July 18th of this year, and opened fire to resist arrest, killing Indian constable Terry Poole and self-defense corps members Shen He. Huang was also arrested. The Shanghai District Court opened a trial on the 23rd of this month, declared the debate closed, and waited for sentencing.</p>
<p>Sentencing Situation</p>
<p>Yesterday morning was the date of sentencing. The Judicial Police Brigade [unclear] dispatched a large number of bailiffs inside and outside the court to implement security. The lawyers Mao Xianshen, Cheng Zhengping, and Ji Chao, hired by the families of the deceased Shen and Jiang from the self-defense corps, and the defendant's defense lawyer Zhu Hui, were all present in court. At about 10:00 a.m., the presiding judge, Zhao Zhengzhang, the president of the District Court, accompanied by the two judges Wu and Yu, and the prosecutor, took their seats in the Third Criminal Court. Huang Cifu was escorted to the court by four Chinese detectives and two Chinese constables.</p>
<p>Judgment Statement</p>
<p>After President Zhao called the roll, he stood up and read the main text: Huang Cifu is sentenced to five years of imprisonment for fraud, sentenced to death for continuous murder, and deprived of political rights for life. The death penalty shall be executed. The attached civil suit shall be transferred to the Civil Court of this court for trial. The defendant shall be transferred to Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison. [unclear] The items shall be returned to the original owner.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Judgment</p>
<p>[unclear] After the sentence, the reasons for the judgment were announced, stating in brief: Regarding the facts of the defendant's crime, it is extremely obvious. Although the defendant claimed to suffer from mental illness, considering his condition at the time of the crime, such as pretending to go outside the door to view the brilliance when taking the diamond rings, and his state when resisting arrest, it cannot prove that he was mentally deranged at the time. Assuming that he does have mental illness at present, since there was no sign of mental abnormality at the time of the crime, he cannot be relieved of his guilt. Moreover, after [unclear] determination by the court's forensic doctor Hou Guangdi, the defendant did not have mental illness.</p>
<p>Fraud and Murder</p>
<p>As for the arrest by the police for the defendant's crime of robbery and murder, but after trial [unclear] results, the defendant did not [unclear] violence, coercion, or take out weapons to intimidate at the time, so it cannot be considered a robbery. It is actually [unclear] the crime of fraud and murder. Moreover, considering that the defendant is a police officer who commits a crime with knowledge of the law, there is really nothing to be angry about, so the judgment is made as in the main text. If he does not accept this judgment, he can file an appeal within ten days after receiving the judgment, etc. Huang Cifu was silent after hearing the sentence, and was then escorted by detectives and constables into a car and sent to prison.</p>

<h3>Municipal Citizens' Thrift Campaign Inaugural Meeting: Grand Opening with the Declaration of Two Outcomes</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: The Shanghai Municipal Citizens' Thrift Campaign, initiated and prepared by sixteen influential public organizations in the city, held its grand inaugural meeting yesterday at 3:00 PM at the Ningbo Native Place Association on Yu Qiaqing Road. Government officials from both China and Japan attended. Representing Mayor Zhao was Secretary-General Cui Jingzi. From the Municipal Party Headquarters was Yangshan; Chen Dongbai, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Social Welfare; a representative from the New Life Movement branch; Zhu Yunsheng, representing Police Chief Lu Ying; and from the Allied Nations, Mr. Ota, representing Minister Izubuchi of the Army Press Department; Mr. Akaboshi; Lieutenant Tanaka, representing Colonel Matsushima, Director of the Fleet Press Department; Director Hirota of the Shanghai Office of the Embassy's Intelligence Department; Secretary Iwai; Vice Consul Fuku; as well as Chen Shao, Xu Chu, Xiang Yuan, Qin Run, Chen Binhe, Gu Nanqun, and over 1,500 member representatives. The Shanghai Orphanage band played music at the event, and China Film Company sent personnel to film news footage of the meeting. The assembly also telegraphed greetings to Chairman Wang.</p>
<p>Declaration of Establishment</p>
<p>The following is the original text of the declaration of the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Citizens' Thrift Campaign: "Thrift is virtue." Ancient teachings are clear. The beginning of benevolent governance prioritizes frugality. Amid chaos and disorder, the key to good governance lies in diligence and thrift. Simple clothing and food are the foundation of everlasting achievements. Coarse garments and hats led to the revival of the nation. Reduced clothing counts were a hallmark of the Zhenguan era, unseen since ancient times. Understanding the difficulty of material resources begins with diligence in national affairs. When the people's strength is relieved, the nation is stable and strong. This is not accidental, as history shows. Now that the political system is reformed and sovereignty rests with the people, practicing thrift and cherishing resources relies even more on the voluntary action of the people. Only then can we overcome difficulties and achieve effective governance. In times of war, the disparity between the supply and demand of materials is significant, and not a single bit should be wasted. This is understood by everyone and needs no further elaboration. Looking ahead to the reconstruction after the war, the importance is even greater today. Without establishing a strong foundation and preserving vitality, achieving significant results is impossible. We must be like passengers in the same boat, helping each other for the common good. This is why the thrift campaign cannot be delayed or neglected. Shanghai is the economic and cultural center of the country, and its every word and action affects the entire nation. In the past, due to the existence of concessions, power was inverted, leading to extravagant habits. This has become deeply ingrained. In the past, consumption had already been deemed far beyond the standard of living. In recent years, even more so, as it is far from the war zone, it is like a paradise, and extravagance has become even more rampant. Now that we have regained our original status, we should wash away old habits and cultivate a culture of thrift and frugality to adapt to the wartime system, consolidate the foundation for reconstruction, and set an example for the whole country. The purpose of this association is to practice the above principles. The rules and regulations are not complicated, but aim to ensure that everyone can implement them, so as to achieve everyone practicing it, day after day. To contribute to the victory of the war and the reconstruction after the war, each person should do their part. May all our compatriots and gentlemen be aware of this.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, Chairman of the Congress, gave a speech at the opening of the conference, stating: "Today is the inaugural meeting of the Citizens' Thrift Campaign. No one would ever object to thrift, so thrift is extremely ordinary and extremely solemn. The significance of the thrift campaign, in a broader sense, is that thrift is of utmost importance and closely related to the country and society. In a world of chaos, only nations with hard-working and enduring peoples can maintain their eternal existence. No matter how society changes, arousing the spirit of autonomy and self-discipline will never be a loss. Therefore, the importance of thrift should be given top priority. If someone says this is an exaggeration, I will take a step back and say that, in a smaller sense, in terms of personal life, personal life is greatly affected. In the process of life, childhood centers on the family, youth centers on marriage, and middle and old age center on friendship. In these three stages, if you indulge in extravagance and do not engage in thrift, the harm will be profound. I will give an example. Those who cannot save in the family will have disharmony between brothers, discord between sisters-in-law, and disputes over property, leading to the danger of family breakdown. Regarding marriage, today's freedom of love is a matter of course, but if men and women love each other and wish to do so, they can freely engage, but those with elders above them will never have this freedom. They must consider the family status of both parties and boast of mutual friends and relatives. Therefore, due to unsuitable conditions, the love of children is sacrificed. This is a common occurrence. If the family is too strict, it will lead to suicide and endanger life. As for old age, people seek pleasure in life in old age, and eventually they will meet good friends, but in early years of making friends, the rich hear the air, and the poor are poor. When the poor friends root water after that, sometimes they knock on the door to see party friends, often they are blocked by the servants below. Therefore, it is difficult to make friends on the face and suffering deepens. Therefore, thrift is deeply related to the country and society in general, and is extremely close to individuals in particular. Therefore, a thrift campaign cannot but be undertaken. Talking about thrift must be done from the individual, engaging in simplicity and frugality. Therefore, the thrift campaign is not only for each person to save, but also for most people to save. Do not be thrifty for a moment, but be thrifty for life. This is of great benefit to society and the country. Starting from the starting point of local efforts to promote the movement, we must first organize meetings before we can do it together, with thrift as the only belief. It should not be a personal belief, but a belief in thrift for the country and for society. We must cultivate a good atmosphere of frugality.</p>
<p>Hirota's Speech</p>
<p>Director Hirota of the Shanghai Office of the Embassy's Intelligence Department gave a speech, stating: "Today is the establishment of your association. I am honored to attend and give a speech on behalf of the association. Today, all of you present are the most influential people in Shanghai. Thrift is beneficial to the country and society. We look forward to the automatic initiation by the citizens of Shanghai. Whether in China or Japan, the thrift campaign should be actively promoted. Looking back, since the Xinhai Revolution in China, there has been constant talk of unity and self-improvement, but China's construction has not yet been successful. This is due to the oppression of Britain and the United States, which has prevented the fulfillment of its mission. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the aggression of Britain and the United States will be wiped clean, and reconstruction will begin. Therefore, thrift should be practiced everywhere to achieve success. Furthermore, China sympathizes with Japan's war against Britain and the United States, and declared war on Britain and the United States on January 9 of this year, standing on the same front, sharing life and death, to complete the Greater East Asia War. Not only in terms of military strength, but also in terms of military thought and economy, we must advance on three fronts to establish the Greater East Asia War. Due to all of these reasons, we must fully practice thrift to contribute to the country, so that materials are sufficient and economic power is strengthened. Whether large or small, we must implement it thoroughly. Therefore, the significance of the thrift campaign is profound, directly enriching national strength and indirectly stabilizing people's livelihoods. We express our deep anticipation for the automatic initiation and organization by the citizens of Shanghai, and at the same time express our sincere congratulations."</p>
<h3>Air Defense Measures Increasingly Comprehensive; Consideration of Air Raid Insurance; Yellow Sand and Water Buckets Must Be Regularly Prepared</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: With the cooperation of various parties, citizens are becoming more proficient in their knowledge and skills regarding air raid measures and civilian air raid equipment in this city. To promote the thoroughness of the air defense network in each district, the Municipal Baojia Committee has ordered all Baojia offices under its jurisdiction to advise residents in each district to set up yellow sand and water buckets, and to keep them regularly prepared in case of emergency, so that civilian air defense forces can be invisibly strengthened.</p>
<p>Commercial News Agency Report: According to Japanese newspapers, the Shanghai Japanese "National Damage Insurance Company Association" has been designated by the Japanese authorities to promote "Air Raid Insurance" in Shanghai. The insurance contract requires a premium of two yuan for every six months for an insured amount of one thousand yuan. As for the Chinese side, the relevant authorities are also considering promoting this insurance, and detailed measures and insurance costs still need to be determined. It is reported that in addition to the insurance that has been implemented for the cotton cloth purchased by the General Chamber of Commerce, "Air Raid Insurance" is also being considered.</p>
<p>Datong News Agency Report: To improve air defense equipment in each Baojia district, each Lianbao is required to prepare the following items: Fire Knockers: This fire knocker consists of a bamboo pole of equal length with a straw rope tied to one end. Its purpose is to extinguish incendiary bombs. When in use, the end tied with the rope is immersed in water and knocked against the bomb, which can extinguish the incendiary bomb. Sandbags or sand buckets. Water buckets or water tanks. Long ladders. Straw mats.</p>
<h3>Price Increase for Pedicabs Resolved</h3>
<p>Recently, the Pedicab Rental Industry Association of this city increased prices without formal approval from the competent authorities and widely published the increase in newspapers. The First District Public Office issued a written warning and notified the association to submit a memorial explaining the reasons for the price increase for verification. According to the submitted report, prices have recently risen, and the prices of key materials for pedicabs, such as hardware and tires, have risen even more sharply. Under these circumstances, it is impossible to maintain operations, which affects the livelihoods of workers. In view of the fact that pedicabs are an important means of transportation in this city and to maintain the operation of pedicabs, and taking into account the livelihoods of more than 10,000 pedicab drivers in the city, the District Public Office cannot but give benevolent consideration and find ways to provide relief, but at the same time, the burden on the citizens must also be taken into account. With the approval of Mayor Chen, the prices have been revised. (Double-seat rickshaws: initial 30 minutes for 18 yuan, every 5 minutes thereafter 2 yuan, every hour 30 yuan. Single-seat rickshaws: initial 30 minutes for 12 yuan, every 5 minutes thereafter 1.5 yuan, every hour 21 yuan. Double-seat sedan cars: initial 30 minutes for 18 yuan, every 5 minutes thereafter 2 yuan, every hour 30 yuan.) The First Police Bureau was instructed to comply.</p>
<p>In addition, the Shanghai Bus Company on Tongfu Road had a dispute due to increased fares. After the Bureau of Social Welfare summoned both parties to the bureau again yesterday and strongly persuaded them, an agreement was reached. It was agreed to readjust the fare to 80 yuan per day. The company must not dismiss drivers due to the occurrence of this case. After the city license is obtained in the future, the fare will remain the same, and a written record was signed at the scene.</p>
<h3>Japanese and German Consuls General in Shanghai Visited Each Other Yesterday</h3>

Mr. Chapellain had served in the Chinese postal service for more than 30 years and was known for his diligence and kindness to his subordinates. Now that he has passed away, all postal workers mourn him. The body was placed in a coffin at the Universal Funeral Parlor yesterday, and more than a thousand postal workers voluntarily went to the funeral. When the coffin arrived at the French Cemetery for burial, the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, led by the postal worker military band and green-clad postal workers, carried wreaths and lined up. The line stretched for miles. Mr. Chapellain's friends and postal authorities all attended the burial at the cemetery.</p>
<h3>West Shanghai Household Flour to Be Available for General Sale Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The sixteenth phase of household flour for the first and second wards of the West Shanghai district, totaling 8,032 packages of first-grade flour and 1,606 packages of third-grade flour, has been processed for shipment by the district's public grain joint office and is expected to be available for sale tomorrow (the 29th). Each person can purchase 1.4 catties of first-grade flour and 0.4 catties of third-grade flour with a certificate, priced at 11.4 yuan.</p>
<h3>Seventh Phase Rationed Sugar to Be Available for General Sale on the Second of Next Month; Price May Increase by One Dime Per Catty</h3>
<p>The sugar rationed for the seventh phase in this city has been approved by the military distribution authorities to continue to be handled by the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office. The sugar will be available for general sale this month, but due to shipping procedures, it must be postponed until the second of next month. All authorized retailers should regularly exchange purchase certificates and pay for the goods for shipment on a scheduled date. The announcement from the office is copied below:</p>
<p>Deadline for Exchanging Certificates and Paying for Goods</p>
<p>It has been found that the seventh phase of rationed food supply has been prepared by this office. It is now scheduled to issue purchase certificates on the 28th and 29th of this month. All retailers who sell rationed sugar must affix their seal to the previously issued blank receipts and indicate the quantity in the upper-mentioned deadline in order to receive the purchase certificate, and must pay the full amount to the designated sugar store before the 30th of this month and sell immediately. Delays are not allowed. In addition, the date for users of Group 1 (i.e., former Class B retailers) to exchange purchase certificates will be announced separately.</p>
<p>The Price of This Phase May Increase Slightly</p>
<p>Regarding the price of sugar in this phase, the person in charge of the office told reporters, "It has been found that the sugar distributed by this office in the future will be distributed by the military authorities. The cost per catty is 4.74 yuan, while the current price of rationed sugar is 4.7 yuan per catty. In the past, because the sugar distributed was owned by the shareholders of this office, the difference of a few cents was not taken into account. However, since it is now acting as an agent, the difference of a few cents, if calculated as an integer, is not small. At the same time, the cost of issuing sugar certificates to various authorities is also borne by the office. In order to take into account the cost, the price may be increased by one dime per catty to 4.8 yuan, but this has not yet been decided and must be approved by the authorities."</p>
<h3>The Materials Investigation Committee Does Not Send Personnel to Investigate Along the Road</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Materials Investigation Committee's investigation of hoarding of materials in Shanghai has become increasingly tense. The task and scope of the investigation are to investigate whether there is hoarding of materials in the warehouses and factories of various public and private companies and firms, as designated by order, and no personnel are sent to investigate when the authorities approve the movement and transportation of goods. It has recently been reported that unscrupulous people often impersonate investigators from the Materials Investigation Committee, intercept and investigate, and carry out fraudulent behavior, which is extremely harmful to merchants. The person in charge of the association told reporters yesterday that the association has not sent personnel to patrol along the road. If this kind of situation is discovered when transporting goods, it can be truthfully reported to the authorities.</p>
<h3>The School for the Unfortunate: A Record of the School for the Blind (1)</h3>
<p>On Hongqiao Road, a place of poetry and painting in the western suburbs of Shanghai, several famous cultural fortresses once stood. The only one that remains is the School for the Blind at the eastern end of McClain Road, which is creating miracles of human civilization. It has a magnificent Western-style building and an endless expanse of farmland, which has been renovated after several wars. It is full of peace, tranquility, and an atmosphere that makes people feel attached to it. In the golden autumn sunshine, the wind is filled with the fragrance of flowers, carrying the sound of teachers and students reading, mixed with the solemn and peaceful sound of the piano, arousing the desire to visit this school immediately.</p>
<p>The Sad History of Management</p>
<p>From the ancient city-style gate came an amiable old man who opened the tall and heavy iron gate. A puppy came out to greet us, making the school seem full of life in its tranquility. Mr. He Zhizeng, the vice-principal, has been involved in blind education for 29 years, but he is still full of youthful spirit. He first told us about the glorious history of the School for the Blind.</p>
<p>Thirty-two years ago, one year before the birth of the Republic of China, Dr. John Fryer, who had contributed to the enlightenment movement and social and cultural undertakings in China, accepted the opinions of some enthusiastic people at the time and donated a large sum of money to establish the School for the Blind on North Sichuan Road, specializing in the admission of Chinese blind children and providing them with special education. At that time, the purpose of running the school was threefold: First, in view of the plight of homeless wandering blind children, to provide shelter and relief in accordance with God's love for people and human sympathy and mutual assistance; second, to enable blind children not only to have a place to live, but also to acquire special skills in school so that they can make a living in the future and not be a burden on society; third, and further, to enable blind children to learn specialized skills and promote the education of the blind after graduating from school, so that even if there are blind children in China in the future, all blind people can serve the country and society.</p>
<p>After four years of arduous management, the school was barely prepared, but the number of homeless blind children who should be admitted was still increasing day by day. The cause of the school for the blind urgently needed to be expanded. In the fourth year of the Republic of China, a new and luxurious school building suddenly appeared at No. 4, Yidingpan Road, Nishi, and the teachers and students worked even harder in teaching. In the second year (the fifth year of the Republic of China), a handicraft department was established to enable blind children with similar talents to learn handicraft skills that could make a living, such as weaving and equipment, and at the same time, the school could sell some products to help with general expenses. As for the academic subjects, they were originally at the elementary school level, but later, with the permission of St. John's University, they could be inserted into the specially set up high school department of the university. Therefore, a junior high school department was opened in the seventh year of the Republic of China, and graduates were sent to St. John's for further study.</p>
<p>In April of the twentieth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Chuan Burlan, the principal of the School for the Blind, attended the 36-nation International Blind Conference held in the United States as a representative of China, enabling well-known figures from various countries who were enthusiastic about blind and deaf education to recognize the importance of assisting blind and deaf education in China. In December of the same year, the completed new school building at No. 290, Hongqiao Road, was also declared completed. A girls' school building was attached to this building, and a girls' school department was opened after the winter vacation, focusing on the education of female blind children. In this way, the first complete blind education organization in China laid the foundation for a promising future of active development.</p>
<p>The Secret of the Blind Not Being Blind</p>
<p>Blind children from all directions, once they enter the gate of the School for the Blind, the "life" of the black hell in the past ends. What unfolds before them is a bright path. Not only do they receive the care of love between human beings, but from then on, they are integrated into another warm and united world, and what they do not know is that they are not blind people! They can read and write like ordinary people, and then take on all the tasks of society and the country! This is not a fantastic miracle, but a simple fact!</p>
<p>So, how do blind people read and work? Mr. Fan Fubao, the director of studies, a half-blind enthusiastic scholar who has been engaged in blind education for more than 20 years, led us to visit various departments of the school to answer this question for you. It turns out that blind people have specially made characters and books! "Braille" consists of 54 basic symbols, which are spelled out in Chinese characters according to the phonetic methods of the national language, Roman characters, or Latin characters, including the tones of the language and the new punctuation marks, for a total of 69 basic symbols. English, including some commonly used basic words and Arabic numerals, has only 56 basic symbols. These symbols, when combined, form words and languages. Perhaps some people suspect that there are too many basic symbols and that they are difficult to remember. In fact, the five or sixty basic symbols are just changes in six raised dots, much like the changes in the ancient Chinese "Eight Trigrams." However, the basis of the Eight Trigrams is "Qian," that is, "three," and the new composition of each line constitutes sixty-four "Gua." The basic symbols of Braille, on the other hand, are composed of the following: In these six points, different phonetic symbols are formed by the level or convexity of each point. The basic phonetic symbols in Chinese are about fifty-four consonants and vowels such as b, p, m, f, d, t, n, l, g, k, h, j, q, x, zh, ch, sh, r, z, c, s, y, w, a, o, e, i, u, ü, ai, ei, ao, ou, an, en, ang, eng, er, yi, wu, yu, wa, wo, wai, wei, wan, wen, wang, weng, ya, yao, ye, yi, yin, ying, yong. Then, use these phonetic symbols to spell out characters. Therefore, when you open a blind person's books or dictionaries, they are (books without words), only rows of crab-like raised dots. Blind people use the sense of touch of their fingers instead of the vision of their eyes, and they can quickly read the sentences in the book and quickly check the dictionary. This method of literacy is similar to the Romanization of the national language, and it is much easier to teach than square Chinese characters. No wonder blind people can read books like sighted people! However, the progress of science is human-oriented. Not long ago, the United States and the Soviet Union had invented another kind of blind education tool, which is roughly similar in structure to gramophone records. The textbooks or materials to be taught, and even the news in the daily newspaper, are recorded on the records. The records are special paper records, which are light in weight and can be rolled up and mailed. After receiving them, they can be played back by sound according to a certain method. It is estimated that in the near future, blind people in China will also be able to use this new teaching tool. However, charts and models will naturally have to use the original raised lines, raised dots, symbols, etc. In short, there is no mystery in blind people not being blind. Scientific research and discoveries have compensated for their natural defects.</p>

<h3>Unregistered Milk Farms to Be Thoroughly Investigated</h3>
<p>The phenomenon of production and sales of unregistered milk farms in this city will be thoroughly investigated by the First District Public Office. It is understood that the authorities have decided to implement this thorough investigation in the near future.

<h3>Sentiments on the Birthday of Confucius</h3>
<p>— Wang Duanru</p>
<p>The world is declining and the Dao is weak, and Confucianism has been in decline for a long time. People in the southeast are deeply worried about this, so they have established the Chinese Confucius Society. Mr. Shen Xinqing is in charge of its affairs and has set up a general assembly in Shanghai, because it is an area where talents gather, and it is easy to achieve twice the result with half the effort in lecturing and asking questions. Our Shaanxi is located in the north, and the culture is backward. The scriptures are still passed down, but they are on the verge of extinction. My brother Yaoxian lamented the decline of Confucianism, the great meaning and subtle words were lost, so he abandoned commerce and followed Confucianism, requesting it from Zhang Guoqifu Zi. Once he suddenly became enlightened. He strengthened his determination to promote it and resolutely destroyed his family to study. Duanru followed behind him and repeatedly donated large sums of money to purchase bases. In the 24th year of the Republic of China, the Confucius Temple and Zongsheng School were established in Jiwang Village, Mae Township, Lintong County, his hometown. The Lingchuan Temple was also built in Lingkou Town, with an affiliated classics reading school. The Guanxue Temple and Guanxue Academy were also built in Xi'an, and the Wufuzi Temple and Jingxian Academy were built in Fengwang Village, Jingyang County. All of them enroll students free of charge to teach the national studies. It is also planned to set up a Zhou Nan School in Xijing City, following the legacy of the empress, mainly for female students. These are all the things that Duanru's brothers have worked hard to manage and operate, and they have been seen in reality. Now, on the birthday of the supreme sage and teacher, I respectfully offer my humble words as a celebration, and state my feelings as such.</p>
<p>Economic Circles Comments</p>
<h3>Securities Exchange Resumes Operations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange, which had been suspended for over six years since the August 13th Incident, has officially announced its resumption of operations in the newspaper by its board of directors. The reopening ceremony will be held tomorrow at 10 a.m.</p>
<p>For the past six years, the Shanghai securities industry has been unofficially trading securities for clients on the black market. Now, it is fortunate to have obtained the government's understanding, allowing it to conduct securities trading for clients openly and formally in the market. This is indeed a significant economic event worthy of celebration.</p>
<p>In the past, the outflow of idle capital in Shanghai mostly flowed towards hoarding goods. However, since the government issued the order to purchase cotton yarn and cloth on the 9th of last month, this trend has declined. Subsequently, the government ordered the Central Trust Bureau to organize "Special Savings Lottery Bonds," and the Central Reserve Bank, together with the Shanghai financial community, held a "Prize-Bearing Fixed Deposit Savings Campaign" to absorb some of the idle capital in the market. However, many commentators believe that the most enlightened and effective measure for the authorities to absorb idle capital is the officially authorized resumption of operations of the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange.</p>
<p>However, things in the world often suffer from the problem of "supporting the east while the west collapses." Resuming formal trading of Chinese securities is indeed sufficient to absorb a large amount of idle capital. However, after the resumption of formal trading of Chinese securities, attention should be paid to preventing speculation, stabilizing prices, and strictly reviewing listed securities, so that securities trading can move towards the right track. This is the original intention of the authorities in allowing the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange to resume operations, and it is also the most important issue for the board of directors and supervisory committee of the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange in the future.</p>
<h3>After All Brokers Are Confirmed, Securities Trading Will Officially Commence; Resumption Ceremony to Be Held Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange received orders from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to prepare for resumption of operations as soon as possible, it convened a temporary shareholders' meeting, decided on capital increase measures, and actively carried out preparations. Now, the proposed business charter of the exchange has been submitted for approval, and the brokers participating in stock trading have been submitted to the Ministry of Industry for review. The first batch of 39 firms has been approved to enter the market for trading, and the second batch will also be announced within days. At the same time, the exchange's supervisory committee, appointed by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, has also been established. Therefore, the exchange, in accordance with current regulations, will first handle the registration of various listed stocks within five days from the 24th to the 28th of this month in order to allow for trading after qualified review. At the same time, the resumption ceremony is scheduled to be held at 10:00 a.m. on the 29th of this month. The exchange has invited the relevant authorities to send personnel to the venue for guidance. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Registration of Listed Securities</p>
<p>Since the exchange issued the announcement for the registration of listed securities, various companies in the city have been enthusiastically registering their listed stocks with the exchange recently. The registration conditions are in accordance with the "Principles for Reviewing Listed Stocks of This Exchange": limited liability companies, those approved and registered by the competent authorities, those with a capital of 5 million yuan or more, those with a capital of less than 5 million yuan but with total assets of more than 10 million yuan, and those that have been incorporated for more than one year may be allowed to register. The registration form stipulates that the following must be filled in: company name, date of establishment, date of registration, location of headquarters, location of main factory, business scope, proprietary rights, total capital, total number of shares, fixed dividend, par value per share, date of premium issuance, name of preferred stock, company history, capital increase and decrease history, subsidiary businesses, production volume and/or sales amount for the last five years, dividend records for the last five years, accounting year, location of branch offices or factories, directors, supervisors, and key personnel, distribution of shares held by shareholders, and remarks.</p>
<p>Internal Organization Divided into Three Departments</p>
<p>The internal organization of the exchange is divided into three departments under the chairman and secretary-general: General Affairs Department, Business Department, and Statistics Department, which handle all business. According to the Central News Agency reporter's inquiry with the person in charge of the exchange, after the resumption ceremony is held tomorrow (the 29th), stock trading will officially begin around the 10th of next month because the telephone installation for the market brokers has not yet been completed. After the listed stocks are reviewed and approved, they will be determined and announced by the exchange's supervisory committee.</p>
<h3>Real Estate Transactions Have Become Clearer and Scarcer in the Last Two Months</h3>
<p>Real estate transactions in this city occupy an important position in the market. In the past, due to the abundance of idle capital and the rampant hoarding of goods, real estate transactions followed suit, and their prices also rose rapidly. Some people with idle capital, in addition to hoarding goods, also hoarded real estate. General speculators took the opportunity to rise up and engage in "kicking the ball" style of trading. As a result, the price increase became unstoppable. The peak of trading activity was between July and August of this year, averaging more than 20 transactions per day. However, since the government authorities used decisive measures to purchase yarn and cloth, restrict the excessive lending of various money houses, and crack down on speculative hoarding, the market's monetary conditions tightened, and the prices of various commodities also fell, thus falling into a state of stagnation. Recently, during the unusually active real estate transactions in July and August of this year, market prices soared by more than 100%. However, since the second half of September, due to the clearer and sparser transactions, there has been no sharp increase in prices.</p>

<h3>Trend of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rise in Chinese stocks intensified, and the trend of seven consecutive rises was about to appear. In a chorus of positive news, the resumption of the securities market was imminent. The market's money houses were easing, and financial giants were releasing funds to continue to acquire yarn factory stocks. Some shifted their targets to pharmaceutical and other industrial stocks, and buying momentum was also expanding. Trading was even more active. The distribution of various stocks is as follows:</p>
<p>Textiles: Yong'an Textile, under the huge amount of buying, had few sales after the opening in the morning, and the price jumped up miraculously. It then hovered, and finally rose two levels more than Saturday afternoon. Dasheng No. 1 Factory also rose one level, knocking on double passes. No. 3 Factory jumped up more than one level, rushing to half a pass. Yufeng Weaving reached a major pass, rising more than 30% from Saturday. Meiya sharply broke through a major pass in the afternoon. Zhongfang Xinhe's rise was even greater, and buyers also went outside the double passes. Meilun Wool and small-denomination Hongyu and Dachina Weaving also attracted the attention of small investors who valued profits. Xinfeng Printing and Dyeing also saw an upward rush, and buyers of Jingfu Shirts actively raised prices. Jinglun went beyond the par value by 60%. Tianlun Silk Weaving rose by 30%, but there was still more demand than supply. Dagong Weaving debuted, with buyers bidding 70% above par value.</p>
<p>Department Stores: Yong'an Company rose more slowly, with a small portion being sold to buy other stocks (buying Yong'an Textile). In the end, it still rose by more than one level. Xinxin hovered around a major pass and broke out again in the afternoon. Sincere also went outside the level, all rising by more than one level. Zhonglian Underwear opened trading at the last edge.</p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals: Xinya Pharmaceuticals rose more than one level in the buying, and finally came out of the pass. Zhongfa also rose more than one level. Wuzhou Zhongxi and Xinxing Pharmaceutical Factory were all rising steadily.</p>
<p>Finance: Continental Bank crossed outside the pass again. Shanghai Zhexing Jincheng Banking and Zhongyi Trust all saw new high prices.</p>
<p>Public Utilities: Zhabei Water and Electricity and Shanghai Commercial Electricity rose in the rising tide. The former has already knocked on a major pass. Public utilities, electrical appliances, and Xiangsheng tricycles also rose steadily.</p>
<p>Real Estate: Xinyi traded outside the pass. Zhonghua and Yongxing also rose sharply.</p>
<p>Culture: World Book Company rose most sharply, breaking out of the pass. Commercial Press rose one level, and Zhonglian rose half a pass. Yongxiang Printing was firm.</p>
<p>Enterprises: Jiu'an Industrial flew out of the pass and continued to rise. Dachina Industrial rose 20% compared to Saturday. China and Guohua Investment were also quite firm. Xinya Construction was still rising. Buying of Dazhong Fireworks was particularly strong, rising more than half a pass. Huacheng and Nanyang Tobacco Company's rise was also fierce.</p>
<p>Others: Zhonglian Cinema rose 60% above par value. Kangyuan Confectionery had scattered buyers and rose a huge one pass. Fumin Dairy opened trading 30% above par value. Guanshengyuan and Merlin Confectionery both saw higher prices. Standard monosodium glutamate's buying momentum was still booming. Qinkong and Standard Paper made by Zaizao Paper, Da'an Glass, and Hanye were all lifted by buyers.</p>
<h3>Summary of Commercial Information</h3>
<p>Government Bonds: Yesterday, the trend of government bonds still ran counter to stocks. The two types opened flat yesterday and then rose sharply. The final price at noon was higher than two weeks ago. Types A, B, and C were also relatively firm, but Type D's rise was particularly large.</p>
<p>Call Loan Rate: The Shanghai Money Trade Association's call loan rate remained unchanged at 18%.</p>
<p>Rice and Grain: The rice market had few arrivals, and retail transactions were also small. Bulk buying was still strong, and as a result, new rice was only one level away from a major pass, and thin rice also followed the trend. Since Yuan still stood on the pass, the demand for oil was still flat, and the market was stable.</p>
<p>Gunny Bags: Trading remained sluggish, mainly due to the long suspension of military needs and the narrow practical use. As a result, supply and demand were weak, and the market was uninteresting.</p>
<p>Woolen Fabrics: Due to environmental reasons, wholesale transactions have been limited for the past two weeks. Therefore, although prices have fallen for a month, there are still more sellers than buyers. As the weather turns cold and autumn sales begin, there are some transactions above the market, and shop assistants are also slightly increasing purchases. This sharp drop has brought all kinds of prices within the limit price. The cessation of cotton cloth sales has led to a sharp increase in the number of woolen and silk shops. Money houses are replenishing stock for shops that have overdrafts as well as those that do not owe money. As a result, the long-deserted woolen market is said to be turning active again.</p>

<p>Bird's-eye View of Northern Military Base</p>
<h3>Developing Vast Resources, Redoubling Efforts to Enhance Combat Power</h3>
<p>Amidst the fierce battles in the South Pacific, the United States, which is advancing its bases towards Attu Island and Kiska Island, actually intends to use the so-called northern offensive route linking Alaska and the Aleutians to attack Japan's homeland. Its counter-offensive posture is quite formidable. Under this tense situation, the military significance of Hokkaido and Sakhalin Island has increased. Amidst this excitement of combat readiness, Hokkaido has established a five-year plan for increased food production, and Sakhalin Island is also rushing to formulate a ten-year development plan, hoping to dedicate vast resources to enhancing combat power and ensuring food supply. These two places were originally military base areas for resources and food supplies. From now on, they will further enhance combat power and develop resources from the perspective of military strongholds. Tang Ze, the Vice Minister of Internal Affairs, visited the area for ten days, and returned with great confidence in the concretization of the aforementioned plans. A reporter accompanied him, and this report will be written based on what he saw and heard.</p>
<p>Sakhalin Island</p>
<p>Sakhalin Island covers an area of 36,000 square kilometers, possessing vast arable land, abundant forests, one of the world's three major fishing grounds, 〇〇 tons of coal, and countless geological resources. It bears the important responsibility of a decisive battle base. However, people in the mainland have overlooked such resources. Since the Manchurian Incident, the pulp industry has been the main focus of development, becoming an important base for Japan's northward advance. Subsequently, due to the China Incident, the development of underground resources was further accelerated. Taking the Greater East Asia War as an opportunity, it became the driving force for promoting the national policy of decisive battle.</p>
<p>Mining Industry</p>
<p>The center of Sakhalin Island's mining industry is coal. Coal mountains are scattered in the North, South, and Central major coal mountains and throughout the island, with reserves of 〇〇 billion 〇. There are 25 companies engaged in the coal industry, including Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Iron Real, with a total annual production of approximately 〇〇 tons, accounting for 〇〇% of Japan's total domestic production. There are still many coal mines that have not been opened. Once a full-scale mobilization of mining begins, the output will certainly be even more impressive. Sakhalin Island coal's biggest challenge at present is maritime transportation capacity, which prevents the transportation of goods as desired. Efforts are currently being made to improve transportation and allocate wooden ships. Various difficulties will soon be overcome. Currently, the government is also seeking comprehensive countermeasures for coal storage. Many believe that further progress is still needed, and the consolidation of coal mining companies is also an urgent task. At the same time, surveys of undeveloped mining areas should continue, and existing mining areas should be re-examined.</p>
<p>Industry</p>
<p>Sakhalin Island's industry began with the rise of paper and pulp production. Paper production is over 400 million pounds (accounting for one-fifth of the country's total production), and wood pulp is over 400,000 tons (accounting for over 40% of the country's total production). This must be attributed to the Prince Paper Company. However, it is a pity that the industries in other sectors have not yet been revitalized. In 1936, a Sakhalin Sugar Company was established. Currently, one-third of the sugar consumed on the island can be supplied domestically, and there is hope for increased production in the future. Currently, the center of Sakhalin Island's industry is artificial petroleum. The Sihai Coast Mitsubishi Petroleum Chemical Industry, established in 1939, uses Naihoro coal as raw material and has achieved remarkable results. Recently, the Bangtai Artificial Petroleum Plant on the east coast was established with a capital of 40 million yen, and can produce 〇〇 tons of artificial petroleum annually. The future development is unlimited. Sakhalin Island's artificial petroleum production accounts for an important 〇% of the country's total production.</p>
<p>Forestry</p>
<p>In recent years, forests have been slightly weakened due to forest fires and insect pests. Since last year, a fifteen-year afforestation plan has been launched. The Prince Paper Company has always been the largest consumer of forestry products, but due to its production restrictions and maritime transportation capacity, forestry still needs to be re-examined.</p>
<p>Fishery</p>
<p>Sakhalin Island, one of the world's three major fishing grounds, uses 70% of the aquatic products caught for fertilizer and 30% for food. The Sakhalin Island Government's fisheries administration, which encourages aquatic production and aquaculture, is old. However, a new important issue is to unify and merge the three existing organizations on the island: the Sakhalin Fisheries Company, the Sakhalin Marine Animal Industry Company, and the Sakhalin Marine Products Control Association, in order to launch a unified aquatic product industry as part of the local food policy.</p>
<p>Agriculture</p>
<p>Sakhalin Island is said to be abundant in materials, but food self-sufficiency on the island is still a problem. The shortage of arable land and farmers makes it difficult to achieve food self-sufficiency. The authorities have recently sent personnel to investigate and urgently hope for improvement. Secondly, consideration should be given to increasing the number of livestock such as cattle, horses, pigs, and chickens, preparing agricultural instructors, constructing agricultural roads, and subsidizing rural finance. In particular, for farmers who are developing new land, it is necessary to help them build houses and purchase fuel and livestock. It is generally hoped that each household can be helped with 6,000 yen, so the subsidy to agriculture is not a small amount. The island's food self-sufficiency is the center of the authorities' development plan. Currently, a food plan integrating Hokkaido and Sakhalin Island is being established, and regulations dependent on other cities will be abandoned.</p>
<p>The above is an overview of various industries. The Sakhalin Development Company, established in July of the year before last to promote development, has not yet achieved significant results. As a national policy company, this is noteworthy. It is hoped that it can strengthen the allocation of company leaders, correct the ills of bureaucratization, and transcend the concept of profit to move towards the greatest goal of enhancing combat power.

<h3>Trends in the Cultural Circles of the Old Capital</h3>
<p>The Whereabouts of Literary Representatives</p>
<p>Some time ago, Chinese writers sent representatives to Japan to attend the Second Greater East Asia Writers' Conference. The representatives from North China, including Shen Qixian and his group, had already returned to Beijing after the closing of the conference. Only Chen Ying, Zhang Wojun, and the nine representatives from Central China, who were invited by the Japanese Literary Patriotic Society to visit various places and tour Manchuria, did not return to Beijing until the 13th of this month, staying at the Beijing Hotel. That evening, the North China Writers Association hosted a banquet to welcome them back. Liu Ziguang, the secretary-general of the North China Writers Association, even gave a very moving speech. It was, after all, a convivial gathering for literary figures of the times. It is said that the Central China delegation has returned to the south after completing its diplomatic mission, while the North China representatives will attend a joint symposium initiated by four cultural organizations—the Beijing Chinese New Culture Construction Association, the North China Writers Association, the Chinese Life Culture Association, and the Chinese Culture Society—on the 22nd of this month to report on their experiences and impressions from the conference and travels in Japan. It can be said that they will be able to show off their accomplishments.</p>
<p>Oil Painting Exhibition</p>
<p>Artists seem to be very undisciplined. However, this is not always the case. The Chinese Oil Painting Society is an organization formed by several oil painters who do not like to be undisciplined. It has been three years since its establishment. To commemorate the anniversary, the society borrowed the Central Park's board of directors to hold a three-week anniversary exhibition. A total of three sections were displayed. The first section featured works by oil painting enthusiasts in Beijing, with three winners: Chen Yubin, Gao Kekai, and Dang Guohui. The second section featured works by members of the society, especially the excellent works of Tang Guoji, Zhang Zhenhua, Yang Ning, and others. The third section was the most valuable, consisting of more than twenty pieces of modern Western masterpieces collected by the National Academy of Art and Li Shuqi, as well as posthumous works by deceased domestic painters. All were rare and invaluable. The exhibition opened on the 14th of this month. The exhibition lasted for a week, and many people visited it every day, making it an opportunity for major artistic activity.</p>
<p>The Plight of Elementary School Teachers</p>
<p>There is a popular saying in Beijing recently that goes, "Four Cheap Things." What are the four cheap things? First, table salt; second, streetcar fares; third, postage; and fourth, elementary school teachers. Among these four, although table salt is not a valuable thing, it has recently become scarce due to certain reasons, and it is difficult to buy. Moreover, the price has already increased. Streetcar fares are indeed as cheap as they can be, but recently they have also increased from 10 cents to 15 cents. Postage has not changed much, but it is not as though it has not increased compared to before the incident. And then there is the salary of elementary school teachers, which has remained at the same price as a few years ago. The highest is 80 yuan per month, and the lowest is only 55 yuan, which is less than the income of a servant. In this era of high prices for everything, such treatment is really too difficult. No wonder many elementary school teachers have given up their chalk-dust careers and sought other ways to make a living. However, although some have left, there are still quite a few newcomers. The reason is that people who graduate from middle school have no other skills besides becoming elementary school teachers. It is said that these people who have received secondary education are a kind of scholar-officials. These "scholars" are refined and gentle, and cannot withstand even a gust of autumn wind, let alone hard work. Therefore, they have no choice but to go to elementary schools to seek a way to "eke out a living." However, even "eking out a living" has become a problem now. Rice costs as much as 4 or 5 yuan per catty, and 80 yuan in salary is not enough to pay for half a month's worth of food. How can they "eke out a living"? How can they support their families? Therefore, a new method has recently been invented, called "raising subsidies," which is to ask students for extra allowances. In other words, it is a kind of begging. Unfortunately, because this "solicitation" is "extra," it has aroused the attention of the education authorities, who are determined to rectify customs. As a result, the "Beijing Special Municipality Education Bureau" issued an order to stop the "solicitation of living subsidies by teachers in municipal elementary schools, which harms the educational policy," and the schools "obeyed the order and immediately stopped soliciting subsidies from students." However, for those who have already been solicited, there is no way to develop, so special grace is granted, "no longer to be returned" (the above is quoted from the New Beijing Daily on the 17th of this month). It is said that after stopping this "solicitation" that harms customs, the authorities are thinking of ways to improve the treatment of elementary school teachers, but we do not know when they will raise funds and how they will improve it.

<p>National Forum</p>
<h3>The Urgent Need for Police Reform</h3>
<p>Part One</p>
<p>For politics to be on the right track, it requires the governing authorities to use wise regulations and methods, implementing them in all aspects of society. Those who execute and oversee the implementation of these regulations and methods are called public servants. Therefore, having sound regulations and methods necessitates honest and upright public servants to execute them. Otherwise, even with good regulations and methods, if corrupt public servants abuse them, the harm will not only cause the people to suffer but also lead to contempt for government laws and distrust of the governing authorities. Therefore, we demand a reformed politics, one that must not neglect whether the implementers of regulations and methods—the public servants—are honest, upright, and capable of diligently conveying the intentions of the authorities and sincerely extending benefits to the people.</p>
<p>I, as a humble observer, have limited experience and cannot visit remote and desolate areas to assess the performance of public servants throughout the country. However, I believe that Shanghai can represent the best among the nation. Why? Because the more densely populated the area, the more attention must be paid to public criticism. Even corrupt public servants must exercise some restraint. As the saying goes, "A gentleman does not deceive even in a dark room," meaning that in sparsely populated areas, one can act arbitrarily, but only a gentleman can refrain from deception. In densely populated areas, even petty people cannot easily act recklessly. And since Shanghai's population density is the highest in the country, I believe Shanghai can represent the best in the nation.</p>
<p>The term "public servants" includes all those who work in government agencies. However, during times of war, the ones who have the most contact with the public are the police officers. They have fixed positions on roads, at entrances, and on main thoroughfares. In peacetime, their duty is merely to maintain law and order and protect the safety of good people. Their fundamental stance should be to sincerely cooperate with and earnestly assist the well-intentioned public. However, today, because the government seeks to crack down on speculation and hoarding to stabilize people's livelihoods, it has announced various measures for appropriate and reasonable disposal of materials, such as government purchase, restrictions on movement, price limits, and mandatory registration. The government's formulation of these laws is, of course, a necessary measure to safeguard the overall situation and stabilize people's livelihoods. Public servants should absolutely obey, comply with, and implement them without any favoritism. However, the reality is far from it. Such is the behavior of Shanghai's police officers, and I believe anyone living in Shanghai with clear eyes and ears would not deny it. If Shanghai is like this, one can imagine the situation in other remote areas where few people are watching. If this continues, the government's fundamental policies will not be implemented, and the people will become increasingly resentful and uneasy. What the future holds is truly unbearable to think about.</p>
<p>Needless groaning without illness is unacceptable. To repeat errors is still errors. It is even more unacceptable to remain silent and unaware of impending dangers, treating them as normal. "Among the most unacceptable of potential disasters is to have a seeming era of peace and prosperity, but in reality harbor unforeseen troubles." I hope that those in power will take the nation and its people as their priority, resolutely make up their minds, and revitalize the police administration. If so, the nation will be fortunate, and the people will be fortunate (Xu Hongsheng).</p>
<p>Part Two</p>
<p>Shanghai citizens generally have unfavorable impression towards police officers of the special district (formerly patrolmen), which is almost universal. What could be the reason? Because people usually see the police acting in a way that gives them a bad impression. The Chinese people tend to sweep the snow from their own doorstep and ignore the frost on others' roofs, which has resulted in these police officers disregarding the law. I believe that to eliminate such behavior, the following is necessary:</p>
<p>Increase salaries to ensure a stable daily life so that they will not seek unexpected wealth and will be content to do their duty.</p>
<p>Provide all police officers with moral training, emphasizing the importance of serving society. They must use persuasive methods towards the people, fostering goodwill and cooperation.</p>
<p>Eliminate those with outdated mindsets, violent and unreasonable behaviors, as well as the elderly and useless ones. Recruit young, strong individuals who have received adequate education as qualified candidates, or establish police academies. If there is a shortage of police officers, the academy should be responsible for filling the positions.</p>
<p>Impose severe punishments immediately for any illegal conduct.</p>
<p>Incorporate public opinion. If there are reports or other information that is verified, immediately dismiss and investigate the individuals involved.</p>
<p>Assign undercover inspectors to investigate police duties and report daily to determine rewards and punishments. I wonder if the authorities consider the above points to be good? (Ye Renzhen)</p>
<h3>Promoting the "Respect Teachers Fund" Movement</h3>
<p>— Jian Jun</p>
<p>September 28th is "Teachers' Day." It can indeed be said to be a form of respect and enthusiasm for teachers. However, I believe that in these difficult times of hardship, in addition to giving them spiritual comfort, there should be more proactive actions to genuinely express the concern of students towards them. This is why I want to advocate for a "Respect Teachers Fund" movement.</p>
<p>I believe that the contribution to the "Respect Teachers Fund" should be initiated by the students themselves, completely out of sincerity and voluntariness. They should ideally take a portion or all of their usual savings from candy expenses or entertainment expenses to give the teachers some comfort. Although, in reality, perhaps some people no longer have the ability to save due to their unstable living conditions, I believe this is only a small minority. Even if they don't have savings, I believe that if they are truly willing to earnestly contribute for their teachers, they will definitely find a way. They can very well solicit donations from relatives and friends.</p>
<p>As for the method and procedure of presentation, I believe the best way is for each student to hand over the funds they have donated for the teachers to the school's administrative office for safekeeping. This is because, on the one hand, it can avoid the trouble of refusal or acceptance, and on the other hand, it can avoid the problem of "inequality." If this movement can proceed smoothly, I believe that although teachers cannot be said to "benefit greatly," they can at least say that it is "not without some benefit."</p>
