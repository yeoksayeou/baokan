<p>社評</p>
<h3>如期給付紗布價款</h3>
<p>棉紗棉布收買命令公布以後，持有紗布之商人，即遵令申請出賣。全國商業統制總會並設立收買紗布辦事處專司其事，該處自八月二十三日成立，以迄十一月二十六日改組為棉業管理處，經過三閱月之時間，巳將登記審查定價各步　工作，次第完竣，而檢收部分，則因數量繁多，尚未戰事。收買以後應給付之價款，雖經規定為特別定期存單，且已奉行政院核定以十月一日為起期，但因未及檢收，逾期未付。</p>
<p>頃商統會為顧及商艱，俾如期領取第一次存單價款起見，特規定變通辦法，凡未　途收之出賣紗布，買成原主代為保管，光行申請具領價款。自昨日起至三十日正為申請塡報期　。</p>
<p>首先，我們認為商統會這一變通辦法，在體恤商艱的觀點，不失為適當的措置。不僅在出賣紗布之商人，得獲實惠”卽整個金融，也因此而通。況且年關瞬屆，商業結賬，賴此可以調濟頭寸。所以，這一斷法，在工商界與金融界，都有　切的期待。</p>
<p>其次，在出賣紗布者的立塲，對此變通辦法，與其說是政府的通融，母寧設是商人應有的權利。因為從買賣的原則而言，賣方以所有物出賣以後，對於買方即有索取價款的權利；反之，買方將購對方貨物，對於賣方即有支付價款的義務。雖云政府收購意　不同，但買賣原則，不能不顧。此次申請出賣紗布截止期，為九月六日，論理是日即為成交之日，即須付給價款過規定十月一日為起期，已屬勉強。至於出賣紗布之種類繁多，數量龐大，以　整理調查，以及檢收手續，頗為椱雜，辦理需時，因此，應付價款，延過給付。凡此雖為事實，但其責任，在於政府一方，出賣者未級使之遭受損失。</p>
<p>從理論上與事實上　，商統會決定的變通辦法，是其本身的責任。在商統會的通告中，規定紗布出賣者申請手續，非常詳密，並須爾取保證，以防　　。這在商統會立塲，是照有的手續，希望申請者充分瞭解，依照日期及辦法辦理，對於數量種類品質價格各項，忠實塡報，以免日後麻煩。同時，我們希望商統會規定這次變通辦法以後，一方面對於檢收工作，仍須迅速辦理，以期澈底淸結。</p>
<p>我們在紗布收買命令未公布以前，為民生的物價問題，主張澈查囤積，不遺餘力，目的在取締投機，抑平物價，安定足生，在紗布收買命令，已公布以後，對於投機團積者的膺懲固不足惜，而其中亦不免有安分商人，遭受打擊，我們學主張如給付價款，與及早實施配給，目的也在安定民生，顧及商艱。我們的立論，是完針對安定民生為目標，如果責任在商人，當然竭力　正；如果責任在政府，我們也不辭　練的。根據這種立塲，我們極端　同商統會這次對於紗布給付價款的變通辦法，盼望進行順利，如期完成。</p>
<h3>緬甸日陸軍機隊控制印渝空運綫　兩月來擊落敵機六十餘架</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日大本　六日上午十一時發表：凝有方面帝國陸軍前空部隊，自十月中旬以來，即乘隙襲擊渝印問之數運輪　，並聶炸敵空軍根據地丁蘇基阿機塲，予該空輸路以極大威脅。自攻擊開始以來。迄今判明之綜合戰果如次：擊落敵機四十一架（內七架未證實），其中大型運輸機十四架，被擊毀起火之敵機二十八架、內有大型運輸機二十一架，我機“炸及未　基地者計九架。</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　緬甸日軍某基地電，緬　方面日陸軍機隊，自十月十三日以來，已數度攻擊渝空中運輸路，收獲　大之戰果，因使敵方極為狼狽，按渝方失去滇緬公路後、所剩者巳僅有自　蘇　阿繹北緬至昆明之所謂中印　中運鹼路及西藏路綫兩綫。然因西藏路錢被炸所阻，而不能多所利用，故所剿者僅有中印空中運輸路。大東亞戰爭發　兵力迭受重創，最後日軍且完全　得制空機。於是其運　力乃大見低下。然反軸心軍企圖以中國大陳為基地空襲日本土，而增强駐渝美空軍以來，此中印空路已一變其意義，竟成為駐渝美空軍之輸血路，因此渝方報紙曾表示不滿，然此中即空路，雨季後因日空軍之愈加活　，其運輸已益見困難。蓋十男十三日以來，日空軍曾屢次擊落其運　機擊　問時並曾連炸吉大港，坦浦爾等運輸物資堆積地。敵方　狽之餘，為從事運輪轟炸機，並以大量之　鬥機作　衛，改白實為夜間或改變路校，以圖避過日機看守。然入十二月後，其堆積物資根據地之加爾各答，亦慘遭日機痛炸，繼此其援渝輸血路據點丁蘇基阿機塲，亦受重創。</p>
<p>日機大隊轟炸丁蘇基阿機塲</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　據緬旬日軍某某地電緬甸方面日陸軍機隊，前於十三日下午大舉聶炸了蘇基阿機塲，炸毀敵大型機九架，小型機六架，並於空戰中擊落敵機十六架，總計擊落擊毀敵機三十一架，致敵航空陣　極感街動，是役日機亦有兩架自炸。　日戰鬥轟炸機若干架聯合大編隊，飛越阿拉次山脈，到達丁蘇基阿上空，因出敵意料。全為奇襲，故敵陣狠狽不堪。日機乃投彈如爾，炸毀敵權多架後，飛返基地。敵戰門機曾企圖尾追日機，亦殆全被擊落，又是役最堪注意者，厥為敵機因遭日機奇襲，陷於混亂，於滑行路上互　，未幾中彈粉碎。反之，日機因中敵彈左發動機停止遝轉，右發動　吐出黑煙後，仍能航行若干公里，安然飛返基地者，亦有數架。</p>
<p>南京十六日中央社電　印緬邊境渝軍，近又開始　動，但因日軍猛烈反擊，終未得逞，渝方當局不顧民命，驅使滇甘等省人民遠赴印境供英美軍指揮犧牲，渝方之遣　遠征，大半亦為被迫，該方面兵力雖有一部為英美軍，但前綫悉為印度軍與渝軍，作戰出於被迫，故戰意低下，英印軍司令部已承認反攻困難，渝方內部早已一致痛責英美犧牲渝方之陰謀，故渝方在印緬邊境之戰局中，或將深自覺悟。</p>
<h3>決克服一切難關向增強戰力邁進　日東條首相昨發表演</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日東條首相十六日在日本經濟聯盟會全體大會席上發表演說，要　如次：今英，美正舉全力從事反攻，吾人為　潰敵軍。使敵人降服，今後更作更大努力，戰至獲得最後勝利而後巳。今後一年或為決定大數之年，英，美此次作戰，本無明確之戰爭”的，但英，美相互間之利害亦不一致，綜合各項消息，今日英，美唯一所恃之物的載力，已漸消耗，其橡皮，錫，金雜納霜，造船木材等，固已極感不足，即被認為用之不竭之錮戰，石油等，亦大感缺乏。而人的戰力及其他消耗，更不難想像，然帝關於此隔年　，在明確之戰爭日的下，於戰略上確立必勝之態勢，利用大　源，逐漸增强戰力。輿　東亞各國家。各民族閱之提携，亦趨緊密，其中或直接對英，美作戰　國興帝國戰力協力，以完　戰爭。由於彼此間之決意　民衆之堅固決意，　人刻正逐日努力增強戰力，同英。美指導者深知若不打倒日本，不能阻止日本戰力之驚人的增强。英　美必致陷於　潰，故乃不顧重大犧牲，而努力從事反攻作戰，吾人須知為獲得最後勝利，尙須今後戰局將愈益熾烈，政府決領導人民克服一切難關，向前邁進。戰爭之第三年，即為決勝之年，　人為使前方將士作戰順利起見，須急速努力增强戰力，盡可能增强飛機，開發煤礦，今日全面活用日本之生產設　能力、足可增强必要之戰力，應注意者為硏究與實行。而決戰之原動力中，最主要者為勇敢之積神及指導者之氣魄，今敵人正惑焦急之原因，不外因其前途巳布　不安之暗變，敵愈　急，而吾人愈益冶靜，脚踏實地，努力從事各自之工作，以前綫將士之心為己心，一路向增强戰力邁進。</p>
<p>遠藤中將廣播</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日軍需省航空兵器總局長官遠藤三郎中將，十六日下午七時二十分在此間廣播講演「航空機之增　」，要旨如次：敵　國之物資生產力雖甚　大，然而製造飛機必須人力，　國人力雖有一億數千萬，但其人種複雜，且各固守利已主義。反之，日本民族一億一心，又團結共榮圈諸民族，日本於人力方面巳佔優勢。苒觀物力，日本國內雖少，但現在若開發共榮圈各地資源時則絕不弱於美，並我祭精神方面已遠勝彼等，故飛機之發達，美英雖為先驅，但日本現在之科學技術，並不遜色於英美，且日本飛機質的方面已冠絕於世界矣。</p>
<h3>芬希哈罕港附近日機炸沉敵艫艇　陸上部隊連日亦有邀</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　據南太平洋“軍前綫某地訊：日陸軍機隊於十五日下午四時半左右，轟炸芬希哈罕附近澈艦誕，炸沉駁船及大型船舶各一艘全日機全部安返源防。</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　據南土平洋某基地電，新幾內亞島芬希哈　附近日陸帶以少數部隊與優勢之數相時，連日展開激戰。擔任對該部隊補給任務之陸軍水上部隊，頃在敵窩連魚雷艇縱橫活動之海上、勇敢執行其任務，備　艱險，如九日於完成運輸任務之歸途中，曾與敵魚雷艇二般遭遇而交戰，當即擊沉共一艘，另一艘亦受重創收退，日方有舟艇一艘受創。十二該部隊於歸途中，又與敵大型魚雷艇三艘遭遇，經激戰後，焚毀敵魚雷艇一艘，重創其一艘『另一艘被迫狼狽還去，是役日方則無損失、而完成其任務。</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　據南太平洋日軍某基地電、日海軍　艇十二白曾於波根維　島南方海城發見敵魚雷艇一艘，交戰數次，敵力不文，遂企開遁走，日海軍則繼　追擊，終將其擊沉。</p>

<h3>一九四四年　將為決戰年　德全國團結爭取騰利</h3>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　德宣傳部長郭培爾，昨日向經濟界領袖潰說，於檢時過去　月之軍事政治情形後，預言來年戰事，將有決定性之發展。</p>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　德宣傳部易　培爾，星期二在德國宣傳機關會　中宣稱：「德人在過去數月內雖備受創傷，但彼等因此更決心進行此次戰爭，以達副勝利之結果，」　氏檢討過去一年間之政治與軍事，幷討論各宣傳機關今後工作中應　守之各點，渠拿認過去一年中德　前綫與後方曾負起若干重大之負擔，但渠鄭重宣稱：英勇之德國兵士已　破　人之計劃、而國內陣箱亦巳保持堅强之民氣，數人之恐怖空襲足以顯禾其野變之作戰方法終無效用。郭氏旋論及敵人所抱之幻想，以為德軍在若干　點之撤退，即為政治與軍事之崩潰，一如一九一八年十一月之情形。關於此點。郭氏鄭重宣稱，敵人在莫斯科開羅與德黑蘭等會議中，不得不承認其希望已為德國堅定之軍事輿經濟地位所粉碎。</p>

<h3>美全國鐵路員工票決實行總罷工　本月三十日開始序推進</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城卞六日中央社電　據華盛頓來電：美鐵道公務人員組織之五　道友愛會，近因提高工資間題，十五日經全體戰工投票結果，已決定全體罷工。友愛會聯盟本部並發表聲明，謂「本會全體職工投票結果，百分之九七。八均表示不滿現狀，贊同全體罷工，罷工自本月卅日開始循序推進，四日後全美　道職工一齊罷工」。同時五友愛會長亦發表共同聲明，說明本會之立與，謂吾人決定支持總罷工，吾人深知總罷工將有何等影響、然仍出此者，確因此舉對於戰爭之成功，美國大衆之福社有所貢獻。美政府當局對此雖表明罷工開始時，總統即下令接收鐵道，但造羅斯福歸還華盛頓時，將仍取觀望態度、惟由罷負調停鐵道爭議責任之調停委會努力從中幹旋。在罷工聲明發表後，曾約請五友愛會及鐵道公司代表定於廿日在芝加哥舉行鐵道工資會議。又此次發表總罷工者計有司機司爐及其他車務人員等五友愛會所屬職工共有三十五萬，此外尙有非車務員之團體計有十五工會百萬餘人、現正投票表決總罷工事宜，但迄十五日尙未表明最後態度。</p>

<h3>反軸心意見矛盾　英美朋意奸詐　岸情報部長發表談話</h3>
<p>南京十六日中央社電　反軸心軍鑒於最近所這受之敗續，誠恐引起內部分裂，爰特於日前相繼舉行其斯科會議，開羅會議，德黑　會議凡三次，其中參加開羅會　者有英美渝，參加德黑蘭曾議者有英美蘇，莫斯科會議時雖於宣言中附有重慶名義，實際重慶並未被邀參加。綜觀三次曾議內容，各有矛盾，且莫斯科會談中對大西洋憲章置若罔聞，　大西洋憲軍規定戰後歐洲新興國家波羅的海三小國愛沙尼亞拉脫維亞立陶宛得恢復獨立自主，此次於莫斯科會議時為防止　聯惡感，竭力避免言及，田是可觀英美用意之奸詐及存心虛偽與相互間之　忌　中央社記者為明瞭反軸心國連續三次會談之內容及其內幕，昨特訪開日本大使館岸情報道部長，承發表談話如次：「反軸心軍曾於十月底在莫斯科舉行會談，十一月間在開羅舉行英美淪會議，其後又在德黑蘭舉行會議，綜觀彼等軍言內部與大　亞宣言中之本於道義精神者比較實屬相形見絀。彼等功利思想、利害衛突與意見對立，於此更不難　其全豹。我人若對彼等三次會議內容加以檢討，更不維獲悉英美犧牲他人，供巳國利用之奸謀。會議動機表面似有洽商之意，實際正可象徵彼等因近受種種戰敗影響與內心之焦躁所致。最近南太平洋日方所獲得之無上戰果，及大束亞共同宣言發表後大東亞各國更形緊密團結，給予反軸心間衝動極大，彼等為抗囘最後厄運，乃不以惜以卑劣手段，出此下策。開羅及莫斯科德黑蘭會議主要者乃在英美蘇三國利益問題，迫使渝方參加　實恐懼其覺悟，此乃反軸心之說謀，其問內在之意見不一，更不難想見，最近史末資曾在倫敦論演說，表明英美蘇「三位一體」之意見，大意謂此第二次大戰結果，必為英美蘇三列强支配全世界，按史末資為反軸心陣綫中有力人士，此次公開演說，竟卑視重慶，由此可見美英對　方之眞意所在，德黑關會議為英美蘇三國之陰謀，故力謀避免重慶參加，其中如開閱第一　塲等等，均無且體結果，等於莫斯科會談內容之空洞，我人對反軸心此　相互猜忌，互作陰謀之奸詐技倆，實質可哂也。</p>
<h3>合作事業委召開　聯絡員會議　陳主委報告工作重點</h3>

<h3>基輔公路上　兩軍酣戰達旦　南路德軍展開反攻</h3>
<p>莫斯科十六日中央社電　基輔戰役現入第五週，大有死恢復燃之概，此一戰役仍可代表德軍在束錢之大規模攻勢，藉以對抗蘇軍向巴格及阿得沙可方面之推進。據蘇軍情報，前夜瑪林（基輔四六卞里）西南之基輔公路上酣戰達且，迤南則蘇軍於拉杜密斯爾鎭撤退後，結集其防禦部隊於泰特列夫河之東岸，雙方均補充兵力　陣以待。</p>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　海通社訊：大聶伯河濟自昨日起，已成為德軍反攻之重心，德軍自西出擊，幷在基洛狀格勒向前進嬰，迎擊柯尼夫將軍向南進攻部隊之側異，故柯尼夫將軍軍隊企圖向克里伏洛格推進之計劃，已遭暫降挫收。且德軍此一反攻，亦已暫獲减輕基洛伏格勒德軍陣地所受之壓力。中路敵軍在普利伯河與貝西那河之間進犯多日後，近忽調其軍隊向西進攻，企圖突入許洛平與員西那轟伯河之交流處，向德軍施突擊，德守軍機警即予挫收。納維爾方面敵軍續調增援作戰，現仍在奶戰中，但陣地無重大變化。</p>

<h3>義境德軍進行　彈性防御戰　美軍驅法傭兵充砲灰</h3>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　德團新開社，南義前綫克拉克將軍之美五軍所守之地區，經數日之平靜後，復於星期二展開劇烈之戰爭　動。西路之美軍在過去數日內，已由特戈爾漲之　兵加以增援，克拉克將軍似　除　洛哥第二步兵師團外，更擬由北非運渡法國儲兵至南義，蓋渠顯欲竭力節省菜死傷重大之美軍師團。美軍司令部似在仿傚蒙高茂萊之先例，蓋蒙高茂萊將軍曾令純粹之英軍全部由前綫撤退，而使加拿大軍紐西蘭軍與印軍在英第八軍所守之地區作戰。美軍於星期二以强大之衝鋒隊與偵察分遺隊探索德軍之陣綫，同時英第八軍及其海外軍則以午大代價，擴充其橋頭陣地至摩洛河地區之外，英軍進攻隊經六小時重砲之準備後，向前綫束翼之德陣綫發動猛攻，全區當即展開劇戰，但就一般而言，敵之猛攻，均為德軍堅韌之彈性防禦所阻。</p>

<h3>敵方總反攻的崩潰　日本大本營　海軍報道課長栗原大佐　陸軍報道課長松村大佐對談</h3>
<p>使可能者成為可能</p>
<p>松村大佐　同感，同感。美國所得意的是物，日本所得意的是人。人類的智能，人類的力量，正是日本人最得意處。應將它發據到最大限度，以彌補最薄弱之點。關於為日本最得意處的人類，即在更加發揮强大的精神力，更加激發士氣；至於生產戰綫。雖設需要物實，但所謂打開狹路等事，憑藉人類心靈的力量、也不是不能打開的。</p>
<p>有些人動輒以為日本在物質方面是不能和美國比機的。實際上，這次戰爭的特微之一乃是航空戰。從而為了獨截美英的反攻，亦須置重點於飛機。如果再同時置重點於從南方載遝戰爭物資的船舶，則美國雖然自為全世界的兵工廠，但因必須兼顯歐洲，蘇聯和地中海，所以其生產力縱然強大，歷要日本產業戰士　必盡力，那未在東亞方面也不是不能和他們匹敵的。在物質方面輸了便是努力不足的緣故，可貢的就是努力不夠。絕望是不必要的。</p>
<p>栗原大佐　我也如此想。日本今日已經確立自給經濟團。考究一下這個自給經濟　，即使進行二三倍於今日的戰爭，在物質方面也是沒有困難的。至於人力，以我們一　的大和民族為中心，大東亞民族正欣然協力前進，如此看來，在人力和物力方面，都沒有不足。然則生產設備如何？講到生產設備，率　地說，直到戰爭開始時止，這是日本的大弱點，確難否認。</p>
<p>當時，雖然製成了種種出品，但仔細一看，雖造的工作機械都是從美英德買來的。不論什麽稱　難造的零件，就去向美英購買。雖則自己並不是不會造，不過買起來比自己造起來便宜而巳。常然，這是頗有非難的餘地的但那祇因為購買比較自造便宜，所以買了。</p>
<p>可是一待美國實行經濟絕交，便什麽也買不到了。於是日本人拿出潛在的力量，自己動手製造，這便是今日的狀態。結果，一切設備在各方面皆完無缺。這樣一來，物也有，人也有，設備也有。所缺的就是努力。近來關於所謂「狹路」，有人說：「狹路便是努力。「在過去買不到舶來品時，有人說：「狹路就是運用智懸。」我想這確是至理名言。從今日日本的體制來考慮，還不曾有那種使不可能成為可能的難事，祇是使可能的成為可能而已。這不是日本今日的事態嗎？由　種地方想來，這次的戰爭，祗要我們肯努力，前途實在是坦坦蕩蕩的。</p>
<p>總而言之，不論由戰爭資源，不論由人力問題　，祇要我們努力，劣於敵人的生產擴充是可以的。因此，不獨我們日本人，就是大東亞各民族，也非在這個目的下成為一體不可。大東亞會議舉行以後，這樣的氣氛似乎已很濃原了。關於這方面，松村大佐是專門家，發表一點宏論……</p>
<p>大東亞宣言的崇高性</p>
<p>松村大佐　大東亞會議發表的五原則。就是：共存共榮，獨立親睦，發揚文化，繁榮經濟，貢獻世界進化五原則。常時由各代表通過，將它作為建設大東亞的綱領而發表。這可說是國際關係上之新的大憲章，我想是可以規範今後的國際關係的，</p>
<p>這五項原則和英美自圃本位的維持現狀的想法全然不同，乃是眞的共存共榮，而且是開放資源，交流文化，貢獻於世界進化的，所以可說從來沒右像這樣堂皇的宣言。關於這此原則的實際表視，　有中日新條約，菲律賓獨立，緬旬獨立等事實，由此可知決不　美英所說的那種一紙具文，而是具有實力的，不但現在正在實行，就是將來也可實行的。</p>
<p>大東亞會議後，曾在日比谷舉行大東亞民族結果大會。各代珍的赫赫氣魄，以及建設大東亞的意氣，誠可冲天。尤其像巴莫，江特拉鮑斯所說的話，即使聽到的人不贊成，也是可以促進大東亞結集的。像這個樣子，迄今進受虐待的大東亞，至此也回到本來面目，十億的結集行將完成。總之，建設已成立了，正如美英需要時間，日本也逐日强大起來。剛才你提起過的南方資源，實在是莫大的軍需資源，祇要假之以時日，那些統統可以化為戰力。英美之長懼建設大東亞的日本的底力，也是事實吧。從而他們在另一方面，也焦思苦慮，想在這些尙未化成日本戰力以前，展開反攻呀、決戰呀。這就是目前的現狀。</p>
<p>栗原大佐　大東亞宣言確是雄渾的思想。與美英的思想比較，實有　　之差。那樣祟高的精神，恐怕英美是不會了解的吧。因此魚急着展開對日反攻。他們所作所為的，無非都是由於長懼那種偉大的思想。那樣高妙的思想，祇有文化相當發達者才能理解。美英是功利的，物質的，所以有時雖也說出好聽的話，可是，行為却沒市一處是符合的。但日本則有言必行。我想，日本的偉大即在於此，世界人類必會理解這種偉大，這時候，不就是到了日本「八絃為宇」的精神眞正交流的時期嗎？</p>
<p>日本的長處</p>
<p>栗原大佐　察看一下萬國的思想，他們嘴裏雖說得天花亂，實際上則是內容全無。他們常常說起機會均等、門戶開放，這其實是美國的一種侵略主義。就是他們所說的門羅主義，也不過是一種侵略主義。美國捐着門羅主義的招牌，乃得實行侵略南美之實、而使別人誰也不得染指，這的　是極妙的如意算盤。至於他們　東洋主張機會均等，門戶開放，其意義也無非說「我們將來要侵略東洋了」。</p>
<p>松村大佐　一觀美國侵略馬尼刺的歷史，確實悽慘，美國為了引起美西戰爭，不惜自己炸沉一巡洋艦；美國為了在東洋求得立足點，竟這樣設計引起美西戰爭。其後又用允許菲律賓獨立的好餌，誘令菲律賓的軍隊抵當西班牙軍。及至美國陸軍從本國陸續開到，用不着菲軍時，即行拒絕他們開入馬尼刺，卒惹起美菲戰爭。常時，慘遭美軍殺戰的市民達六十萬之衆，這恐怕是人類史上未曾有過的吧，這種虐殺史，洵屬世界第一。他們的殘忍如何，由此可知。</p>
<p>栗原大佐　我在兵學校學生時代，曾聽到鈴木貫大郞大將說過這樣的事：美國貝　提督到日本來，目的是在侵略日本。然而後來他為什麽不　略日本而空手歸國呢？原來員里在日本上岸時，有日本漁夫的妻子　着蹣跚學步的小孩來看他們的行　列，不料她的孩子被石頭絆倒了，地就一　將石塊踢到老達的地方，於是小孩子呵呵　笑起來，跟着走了，貝里看到這一幕，省悟日本人是可怕的。這就是說，他看到母親踢開石塊時，那個被　　的孩子就笑起來的情形，他知道如果惹了敵　心旺盛的人民，其後果是很可長　的，所以打消侵略的念頭，乘乖　國了。自從貝里以還，他們所走的路便全是侵略者的路。同時，我們日本人對不道義者的敵愾心，憎惡心，不須什麽敎養，連三，四歲的孩子都具有的。而今日，對於美國長久問的侵略和不道義正是沸騰敵愾熱血的時間了。近頃敵人宣傳的方法等，也很能顯出他們的本來面目。（吉：譯自十二月五日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>廣田情報部長　談世界情勢　深信英美企劃決難實現</h3>
<p>中央社訊　日本大使館上海事務所主持之定例報道常會，於昨（十六）日下午三時假南京路外灘華　飯店八樓舉行，計到廣田情報部長，福　副領事等，即席由廣田部長就目前世界情勢，發表談話如下：</p>
<p>三國聯擊愈強</p>
<p>廣田部長首謂：目前世界悄勢，在軍事。政治。經濟。外交各方，變幻無窮，本人特加以分析闡明。按照大體上言，反袖心方面之反攻，自本年春開始發動以來，至今巳告一段落，因此反　心方面，在東亞區洲之反攻發展，各方莫不懷具疑惑。然統軸心而觀，日德兩國除防禦反軸心之反攻外，特加强作戰力量，且計劃發動下次攻勞，易言之，我軸心已等待良機予以攻擊，刻巳準備一切。繼　目前戰局之大概，日德兩國，在政治外交上之協力，更緊密堅固，同時　索里尼氏之新生法西斯義大利共和政府，採用以往一貫政策，決意與日德兩國共同完遂戰爭，於此足見日德義三國關　，益為加强，關於日德義三國作戰目的，諸君早巳洞悉無遺，為建設世界新秩序之　成，今巳日漸實現，故此點在軸心之政洽外交上，乃一顯著之特徴。</p>
<p>建立東亞共榮</p>
<p>次述及軸戰之目的，日本在束亞建設新秩序之內容，無人不知建成大束亞共榮圈，此外對政治。經濟，文化等種種，均所企求，共基本問題，首以關於政治上之要求，此次在東京舉行之世界歷史所罕見之盛會大東亞會議，發表之大東亞共同宣言，披瀝頗詳，簡言之，則已脫離英美殖民地狀慈，確保獨立自主之實現，故建設東亞新秩序，不但適用於東亞各國，且遠及阿拉怕，爭朗，伊拉克，西亞各國，亦得適用。繼就經濟以觀，東亞應掙脫英美荷之榨取。東亞本身之經濟力量，完全適用於東亞之建設，則東亞人民生活安定，是乃建設東亞經濟新秩序之目標。我人為達成此項目的起見，當必爭取勝利，是以我人更應儘量努力，確立經濟組織。再就文化以　，關於建設東亞文化新秩序，本人抱有明確理想，値茲目前激烈戰爭進行中，普通人當誤認文化工作之不重要，按文化工作與戰鬥為並行政策，故建設東亞文化新秩序，端　於精神上之加强，是以我人當確立東亞精神文化新秩序。</p>
<p>恢復東亞思想</p>
<p>關於確立東亞精神一點，有人以為學習英美文化，以迫隨於後，發展本身文化，是項錯　見解，亟應加以　除，而　恢復東亞思想，並予確立，此乃必要之事，不但在以往平時，尤以目前戰時更為重要，是以建設東亞新秩序，亦可適用於德國之建設歐洲新秩序，其內容雖稍有不同，雙方精神上之目的相同，尤以歐洲之新秩序建設，乃保衛歐洲政治經濟文化之發達，其理念當亦符合東亞新秩序之內容，故雙方之原則均適用於全世界新秩序之建設，是以軸心之目的，為確立全世界各民族和平生活。及觀反軸心之目的、彼　之行為，以榨取各民族之計劃，以保障本身權益，壓迫弱小民族。最近反軸心在開羅，德黑蘭舉行之會議，英美蘇淪陰謀企圖，在東亞壓縮日本領土，迫降為三等國，此外並約束中國，使中日兩國成為均等勢力，永久繼續對抗，如此項企圖竟能實現，則全東亞人民，均將受英美恣意壓迫榨取矣。</p>
<p>英美陰謀暴露</p>
<p>在開羅會議，彼　討論經濟結果上言，提出開發中國資源之企圖，故中國完全遭受英美之經濟壓迫，榨取政策，以渝宋子文為中心，宋本為親美派，此舉不但反對東亞建設，更以出資巾國，使中國成為英美之屬　、英美壓迫中國，積極進行，我人更可感到菲律質，緬甸。印度等國及南洋，以往遭受英美之害非殘，再以歐洲情形而觀，英美方面，假借恢復民主主義幌子，實則陰謀詭詐，即以義之巴特里奧政權，及法之特戈爾，季勞之對時，未能完整統一，日益增厲，且更默認歐洲共產化。總之反軸心為破壞全世界各民族，不惜運用種種卑鄙手設，尤以在政治經濟文化上，破壞各民族之組織及團結，此事在本年十一月廿六日南非前總理史末資曾表演說，謂除英美蘇外，其他各國將受破壞，彼輩之陰謀額已暴露。我人深信英美之企劃，決難實現，即以目前戰事而論，足以證明，如德蘇作戰，尤以東綫戰爭尚延在膠着狀態，關於義大利戰綫，更無進展，此外如土耳其參戰及巴爾幹登陸，毫無成就，他如在太平洋方面之英美反攻，及緬旬戰綫，反遭受重大打擊云。</p>

<h3>評言　民生問題</h3>
<p>本報所舉辦之中華民國三十三年元旦徵文文題，特以民生問題為範圍，囚為與人民公衆　具切成的關係者、莫過於道　問題了。什麽叫做民生問題？民生就是人民的生活，社會的生存，國民的生計，羣衆的生命，也就是政治與經濟的中心。</p>
<p>解決民生問題的重心，又在於如何解決人生的衣食住行四種需要，所以此次本報徵文通啓中，特　紗布配紛，米糧增產，房屋租貨改善交通等等為例，因為諸如此類釣問題，無一不是今日戰時民生問題的癥結所在。譬如，說到紗布配給罷，配給方案應書怎樣方才可以合於理想？紗布生產應當如何促進，方才可以强化配給前途？說到米糧增產罷，在政治法律上應當制出什麽種種規定來保護農民，方才可以鼓勵其生產，增進其所生產的農品？說到房屋租　罷，政府當局應當怎樣去張制執行「戰時租貨法」，藉以减輕平民階級所受自房地主階級的壓迫與負擔？說到改等交通罷，糧食運輸有無最好的方法，可以疏通其來源？公衆行旅應當怎樣去改善，藉以减輕其痛苦？以上所舉各點，僅是釋例而已，其他有關衣食住行四種需要的一切問題與其解決方法，實有賴於衆思的集合，俾得供作當局的參考。</p>

<h3>夜校應否限制用電</h3>
<p>— 冷眼</p>
<p>上海是一個糜爛的社會。在此非常時期，大家還是登紅酒絲，歌舞昇平，過着糜爛的生活，實是很不對的。現在當局嚴厲限制用電，這眞是救濟上海人糜爛生活的一服良藥。</p>
<p>不過限制用電，我也有些小小的意見，就是我們限制，不能一槪而論的，比方，平日確在努力節省的用戶，事實上巳經不可再省的了，而再限其節省，那簡直等於要他不用；一個平日對電並不　節的用戶，現在要他節省，那他不過苦一些，電是依舊還能使用，這樣一比，不是很不公允嗎。上海社曾，因為情形特殊，所以夜校的設立很多。夜校之與電燈，有着密切之關係，有許多晚校，近兩年來為了物價的高漲，以及當局歷次通告限制用電，所以不待此次之通告，早巳對於用電十分節省了。據我知道，有的補習學校，一二年前，用七十支光燈泡的，為省電關係，巳經改為四十支光的燈抱了，如果現在要他苒减，則對於學生之目力有着極大的影響；要其减少教室，事實上又屬不能，請問叫他如何再省法呢？即以居家而論·我過去點了三隻燈，是四十支十五支五支，共計為六十支，現在呢，為了生活困難，在一年半以前，早巳由六十支光省成五支光的一燈了。</p>
<p>跟制用電，當然也可以，我以為限制要看地方去的。比方，跳舞塲是使且這種地方，是一種吃飽飯肚子不娥的人才去的，我們要省電，此頭地方麽該加以注意的。各家族館，通宵達旦的叫嚮導、又麻將，也是使人生活糜爛的處所，我以為也是應該老大公館，所居高樓大厦，房間很多而住人不多，他們家裏的電燈，光的支，即使叫他們節省百分之九十，他們也不致沒有光明。</p>
<p>總說一句，當局限制用電，還得嚴格的計劃一下，不然，浪費者依然有電可用，而平日已經節制的勢將居於黑暗世界。再有二房東與三房客之糾紛房子的租賃當局已有了規定的辦法，但對於水電良費之辦法，當局也得設法規定，免得斜紛不巳、這對地方治安，都是有關係的啊！</p>
<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪羊譯</p>
<p>九</p>
<p>了眞人十二歲的春天，谷的家中全都很安定了。沒有父親的生活，也都慣常了。而且諸也不是父親在世時候的他們了。</p>
<p>眞人的幼小的心裏，也起了這樣的變化。嘻嘻地，露出門牙微笑着的習慣，還是順樣的，可是，在那笑顏中，却藏着非常强靭而且驚人的彈性。</p>
<p>「哥哥，為什麽你比我先去了？」</p>
<p>有一天早晨，哥哥太郞上學比他先走了一步·所以他在後邊迫上去，就這樣的抗議了。因為他的口吻，相當的　屬·太郞一時竟沒能囘答他。</p>
<p>再又，到了學校，一有空閑，就攀着鐵槓子。蘋果般的臉兒·越發的紅起來，在鐵槓上勉强的旋韓着。</p>
<p>「蝦跳鼎門·雄猛得很！」</p>
<p>無論小朋友們怎樣取笑，他也不停止器械體操。那並不是他已經喜歡器械體操了，而是因為不喜歡自己有不得意的功課。</p>
<p>眞人是從心裏不肯讓人的。</p>
<p>不要屈服於人的——自從沒有了父親之後，不知道在什麽時他有了這種思想。雖然還是童心，但也見到母親的那種一天到晚忙碌着的樣子。對於中途　學，不說一句不平，而在店裏做工的哥哥四吉的行動，也受了深甚的感動，大家似乎都在限什麽門爭，都似乎在抵禦着外人的欺侮。</p>
<p>「我也不能屈服於人的。」</p>
<p>他小小的胸中，也下了決心。當地的風氣，無論那一個孩子，都不肯讓人，可是像眞人這樣意志堅强的知很少。雖然是這樣說，却不常見和小朋友們吵架。因為沒有吵架的機會。他的不肯讓人，包藏在柔和的微笑中，所以就使是皮氣粗暴的，也不知不覺地過去了。薩摩地方有兩種出名的孩子們的遊戲——「搶將官」，和「不討饒」，在這種假吵架的塲合，眞人的不肯讓人，很引起小朋友們的注意。</p>
<p>「搶將官」就是兩班孩子，赤膊着身體，頭上繫着包頭，為保護各自的大將不被打倒，而互相爭鬥，互相防守。在別的都會的小學校，這是被禁止的遊戲。「不討饒」是拿個人做單位的爭鬥，但團也可以。雙方門毆，在一定的時間內，說「討饒」的一方就算輸。這是健兒們素來傳統的遊戲，而在小學校裏還繼承着。</p>
<p>瘦小而沒有力氣的眞人，一下就被打在地上，倒了以後，還要長期的扺抗。</p>
<p>「討饒嗎？」</p>
<p>「不。」</p>
<p>即使通紅的面頰被撳倒砂土中，呼吸也幾乎窒息住了，可是眞人也不討饒，他是不可被人欺侮的。</p>

<h3>Payment of Yarn and Cloth Prices as Scheduled</h3>
<p>Following the promulgation of the order to purchase cotton yarn and cloth, merchants holding yarn and cloth immediately complied with the order and applied for sale. The National General Association of Commercial Control also established an office for purchasing yarn and cloth to handle the matter specifically. The office was established on August 23rd and reorganized into the Cotton Industry Management Office on November 26th. During the three months, the work of registration, review, and pricing has been completed step by step. However, the inspection and acceptance part has not been completed due to the large quantity. Although the payment of the price after the purchase has been stipulated as a special fixed-term deposit certificate, and the Executive Yuan has approved October 1st as the starting date, it has not been paid on time due to the failure to inspect and accept the goods in time.</p>
<p>Recently, the General Association of Commercial Control, in order to take care of the merchants' difficulties and enable them to receive the first deposit certificate price on time, has specially stipulated a flexible method: all yarn and cloth sold but not yet inspected will be stored by the original owner on behalf of the buyer, and the application for receiving the price will be made. The application and reporting period is from yesterday to the 30th.</p>
<p>First of all, we believe that this flexible method of the General Association of Commercial Control is an appropriate measure from the perspective of taking care of the merchants' difficulties. Not only the merchants who sell yarn and cloth can get real benefits, but the entire financial system can also be opened up as a result. Moreover, the end of the year is approaching in an instant, and commercial settlement depends on this to regulate the funding. Therefore, this method is eagerly awaited by the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors.</p>
<p>Secondly, from the standpoint of the seller of yarn and cloth, this flexible method is not so much a compromise by the government as it is a right that the merchant should have. Because from the principle of buying and selling, after the seller sells the property, the seller has the right to ask the buyer for the price; conversely, the buyer who purchases the goods from the other party has the obligation to pay the price to the seller. Although the government's intention to purchase is different, the principle of buying and selling cannot be ignored. The deadline for applying to sell yarn and cloth this time was September 6th. In theory, that day should be the date of the transaction, and the price should be paid. It is already a stretch to stipulate that October 1st is the starting date. As for the variety and quantity of yarn and cloth sold being huge, the sorting, investigation, and inspection procedures are quite complicated, and it takes time to process. Therefore, the payment should be delayed. Although all of this is true, the responsibility lies with the government, and the seller should not be made to suffer losses.</p>
<p>From a theoretical and factual point of view, the flexible method decided by the General Association of Commercial Control is its own responsibility. In the notice of the General Association of Commercial Control, the application procedures for yarn and cloth sellers are very detailed, and guarantees must be obtained to prevent fraud. From the standpoint of the General Association of Commercial Control, this is the necessary procedure. It is hoped that the applicants will fully understand it and handle it according to the date and method. They should faithfully fill in the quantity, type, quality, and price to avoid future trouble. At the same time, we hope that after the General Association of Commercial Control stipulates this flexible method, it should still expedite the inspection and acceptance work in order to thoroughly settle the matter.</p>
<p>Before the order to purchase yarn and cloth was promulgated, we advocated thoroughly investigating hoarding for the sake of the people's livelihood and price issues, sparing no effort, with the aim of cracking down on speculation, suppressing prices, and stabilizing the people's livelihood. After the order to purchase yarn and cloth was promulgated, we would not regret punishing speculators and hoarders. Among them, there are also law-abiding merchants who are inevitably hit. We also advocate paying the price as soon as possible and implementing the distribution as soon as possible, also with the aim of stabilizing the people's livelihood and taking care of the merchants' difficulties. Our argument is completely aimed at stabilizing the people's livelihood. If the responsibility lies with the merchants, we will of course try our best to correct them; if the responsibility lies with the government, we will not hesitate to blame them. Based on this position, we extremely agree with the flexible method of the General Association of Commercial Control this time for the payment of yarn and cloth prices, and hope that it will proceed smoothly and be completed as scheduled.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Air Force Controls India-Chongqing Air Transport Line in Burma, Shooting Down More Than 60 Enemy Planes in Two Months</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 11:00 AM on the 6th: The Imperial Army's advanced air units in the direction of Burma have been taking the opportunity to attack the transport lines between Chongqing and India since mid-October, and have bombed the enemy air force base in Tinsukia, posing a great threat to the air transport route. Since the beginning of the attack, the comprehensive results of the battle confirmed so far are as follows: 41 enemy aircraft shot down (7 of which are unconfirmed), including 14 large transport aircraft; 28 enemy aircraft destroyed and set on fire, including 21 large transport aircraft; and 9 of our aircraft bombed enemy bases.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese army base in Burma reports that the Japanese army air force in Burma has repeatedly attacked the Chongqing air transport route since October 13th, achieving great results, causing the enemy to be extremely embarrassed. According to reports, after Chongqing lost the Yunnan-Burma Highway, the only routes left were the so-called China-India air transport route from Tinsukia in Assam, northern Burma, to Kunming, and the Tibet route. However, the Tibet route was blocked by bombing and could not be used much, so only the China-India air transport route was used. The Axis forces suffered heavy losses in the Great East Asia War, and the Japanese army finally gained complete air superiority. As a result, its transport capacity has greatly declined. However, since the anti-Axis forces attempted to use Chongqing as a base to launch air raids on the Japanese mainland and increased the US air force stationed in Chongqing, this China-India air route has changed its meaning and has become a blood transfusion route for the US air force stationed in Chongqing. Therefore, the Chongqing newspapers have expressed dissatisfaction. However, this China-India air route has become more and more difficult to transport due to the increased activity of the Japanese air force after the rainy season. Since October 13th, the Japanese air force has repeatedly shot down its transport aircraft and bombed Chittagong and Tamu, etc., where transport materials are piled up. In addition to being embarrassed, the enemy changed bomber transport aircraft and used a large number of fighter aircraft as escorts, changed from daytime to nighttime, or changed routes to avoid Japanese aircraft surveillance. However, after entering December, Calcutta, the base of its accumulated materials, was also severely bombed by Japanese aircraft. Following this, Tinsukia Airport, the stronghold of its blood transfusion route to Chongqing, was also severely damaged.</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Bombed Tinsukia Airport in Large Formation</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a Japanese army unit in Burma, the Japanese army air force in Burma launched a large-scale bombing of Tinsukia Airport on the afternoon of the 13th, destroying 9 enemy large aircraft and 6 small aircraft, and shooting down 16 enemy aircraft in air combat, totaling 31 enemy aircraft shot down and destroyed, causing extreme shock to the enemy air formation. In this battle, two Japanese aircraft also self-destructed. Several Japanese fighter-bombers formed a large formation and flew over the Arakan Mountains to the skies above Tinsukia. Because it was unexpected, it was a complete surprise attack, so the enemy formation was in a terrible state. Japanese aircraft dropped bombs like rain, destroying many enemy aircraft before returning to base. The enemy fighters attempted to pursue the Japanese aircraft, but were almost completely shot down. The most noteworthy thing about this battle was that the enemy aircraft were caught in chaos due to the surprise attack by Japanese aircraft, and collided with each other on the runway, and were shattered by bullets shortly thereafter. On the contrary, some Japanese aircraft were able to fly several kilometers safely back to base even after one enemy bullet stopped the left engine and the right engine spewed black smoke.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing army on the India-Burma border has recently started to move again, but failed due to the fierce counterattack of the Japanese army. The Chongqing authorities disregard the lives of the people and drive the people of Yunnan, Gansu, and other provinces to go to India to be commanded and sacrificed by the British and American armies. Most of Chongqing's dispatch of expeditions is also forced. Although a part of the troops in that area are British and American troops, the front lines are all Indian and Chongqing troops. Because the fighting is forced, the morale is low. The British-Indian military headquarters has admitted that the counterattack is difficult. The Chongqing side has long unanimously condemned the British and American conspiracy to sacrifice the Chongqing side. Therefore, in the war on the India-Burma border, the Chongqing side may be deeply aware.</p>
<h3>Resolve to Overcome All Difficulties and Move Towards Strengthening Combat Power - Japanese Prime Minister Tojo Delivered a Speech Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Tojo delivered a speech at the general meeting of the Japan Economic League on the 16th, emphasizing the following: Now, the United Kingdom and the United States are using all their strength to carry out a counterattack. In order to defeat the enemy and make the enemy surrender, we will make greater efforts in the future and fight until we achieve final victory. The coming year may be a year to determine the general trend. The United Kingdom and the United States have no clear war aims in this operation, but the interests between the United Kingdom and the United States are also inconsistent. Combining various news, the only thing that the United Kingdom and the United States rely on today is their carrying capacity, which has gradually been exhausted. Rubber, tin, gold, quinacrine, shipbuilding timber, etc., are already in extremely short supply, and even the inexhaustible war materials, oil, etc., are also in great shortage. And the human combat power and other consumption are not difficult to imagine. However, the Empire, under clear war aims, has established a sure-win situation strategically, using the resources of Greater East Asia to gradually strengthen its combat power. The cooperation with the countries and nations of Greater East Asia is also becoming closer. Some of them directly cooperate with the Empire's combat power to complete the war. Due to the mutual determination and the firm determination of the people, we are now working hard every day to strengthen our combat power. The leaders of the United Kingdom and the United States know very well that if they do not defeat Japan, they cannot stop the astonishing increase in Japan's combat power. The United Kingdom and the United States will inevitably fall into collapse, so they are making efforts to carry out counterattacks regardless of major sacrifices. We must know that in order to win the final victory, the future war situation will become more and more fierce. The government is determined to lead the people to overcome all difficulties and move forward. The third year of the war will be the year of the decisive battle. In order to make the soldiers at the front line fight smoothly, we must rapidly work hard to strengthen our combat power, increase the number of aircraft as much as possible, and develop coal mines. Today, the comprehensive utilization of Japan's production facilities can enhance the necessary combat power. What should be paid attention to is research and implementation. Among the driving forces of the decisive battle, the most important are the spirit of courage and the demeanor of the leaders. Now the reason why the enemy is anxious is nothing more than the fact that their future is full of ominous omens. The more anxious the enemy is, the calmer we should be, work hard in a down-to-earth manner, take the hearts of the soldiers on the front line as our own, and move towards strengthening our combat power all the way.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Endo's Broadcast</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - Lieutenant General Saburo Endo, Director-General of the Aviation Weapons Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Munitions, broadcast a speech here at 7:20 PM on the 16th, "Increasing the Production of Aircraft", the main points are as follows: Although the material production capacity of the enemy countries is very large, the production of aircraft requires manpower. Although there are hundreds of millions of people in the United States, their races are complex and they adhere to egoism. On the contrary, the Japanese nation is of one mind and unites with the nations of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Japan has already gained an advantage in terms of manpower. Looking at the material resources, although Japan is small, it is by no means weaker than the United States when developing the resources of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Moreover, our sacrificial spirit is far superior to theirs. Therefore, although the development of aircraft was pioneered by the United States and the United Kingdom, Japan's current scientific and technological level is not inferior to that of the United Kingdom and the United States, and the quality of Japanese aircraft has surpassed the world.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Bombed and Sunk Enemy Torpedo Boat Near Finschhafen Port, Land Forces Also Had Battles for Days</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a certain forward position of the Southern Pacific Army: The Japanese army air force bombed and destroyed a ship near Finschhafen at about 4:30 PM on the 15th, sinking a barge and a large ship.

The army water transport unit, which is responsible for supplying the troops, is bravely carrying out its mission on the sea where enemy torpedo boats are active, facing all kinds of dangers. For example, on the way back from completing a transport mission on the 9th, it encountered two enemy torpedo boats and fought with them, immediately sinking one and severely damaging the other, forcing it to retreat. One Japanese boat was damaged. On the 12th, the unit encountered three enemy large torpedo boats on the way back. After a fierce battle, one enemy torpedo boat was burned and destroyed, and one was severely damaged. The other was forced to flee in embarrassment. The Japanese side suffered no losses in this battle and completed its mission.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a certain base of the Japanese army in the South Pacific, the Japanese navy torpedo boat discovered an enemy torpedo boat in the sea south of Bougainville Island on the 12th.

<h3>1944 Will Be the Year of Decisive Battle, Germany's National Unity to Fight for Victory</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels told economic leaders yesterday that after reviewing the military and political situation of the past few months, he predicted that the war next year will have decisive developments.</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels declared at a meeting of German propaganda agencies on Tuesday: "Although the German people have suffered injuries in the past few months, they are therefore more determined to carry out this war to achieve a victorious outcome." Mr. Goebbels reviewed the political and military affairs of the past year and discussed the points that the various propaganda agencies should adhere to in their future work. He admitted that the German front line and rear had shouldered some major burdens in the past year, but he solemnly declared: The heroic German soldiers have frustrated the enemy's plans, and the domestic atmosphere has also maintained a strong national spirit. The enemy's terror air raids are enough to show that their savage combat methods are ultimately ineffective. Goebbels then discussed the enemy's illusions, believing that the retreat of the German army at certain points would lead to a political and military collapse, as in November 1918. Regarding this point, Goebbels solemnly declared that the enemy had to admit in the meetings in Moscow, Cairo, and Tehran that their hopes had been shattered by Germany's firm military and economic position.</p>

<h3>US National Railway Workers Vote to Implement General Strike, to be Gradually Implemented Starting on the 30th of This Month</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington dispatch: The five brotherhoods of the US railway workers' organization recently voted to decide on a general strike due to the issue of raising wages. The headquarters of the brotherhoods also issued a statement, saying, "The result of the vote by all employees of the association shows that 97.8% are dissatisfied with the current situation and agree to a general strike. The strike will be gradually implemented starting on the 30th of this month, and all railway workers in the United States will strike together four days later." At the same time, the presidents of the five brotherhoods also issued a joint statement, explaining the position of the association, saying, "We have decided to support the general strike. We deeply know what impact the general strike will have, but we still do this because this move will contribute to the success of the war and the welfare of the American public." Although the US government has indicated that the president will order the takeover of the railways when the strike begins, Roosevelt will still take a wait-and-see attitude when he returns to Washington. However, the mediation committee responsible for mediating the railway dispute is working hard to mediate the dispute. After the strike statement was issued, it invited representatives from the five brotherhoods and railway companies to hold a railway wage conference in Chicago on the 20th. In addition to the five brotherhoods of drivers, stokers, and other train crew members, totaling 350,000 employees, there are also more than one million members of 15 non-crew member groups who are currently voting on the general strike, but have not yet expressed their final attitude as of the 15th.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington dispatch: After the US railway workers decided to implement a general strike, the US government indicated that it would launch wartime emergency powers to take over the national railways when the general strike begins.</p>
<h3>Contradictory Opinions of the Anti-Axis Powers, Treachery of the British and American Allies - Information Minister Kishi Delivers a Speech</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Anti-Axis powers, fearing internal divisions due to the recent series of defeats, specially held three consecutive conferences in Moscow, Cairo, and Tehran. Among them, the Cairo Conference was attended by the United Kingdom, the United States, and Chongqing, and the Tehran Conference was attended by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Although the Chongqing name was attached to the declaration at the Moscow Conference, Chongqing was not actually invited to participate. Looking at the contents of the three conferences, there are contradictions, and the Atlantic Charter was ignored at the Moscow Conference. The Atlantic Charter stipulated that the emerging countries in Europe after the war, the three small Baltic countries, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, should restore their independence and autonomy. This time, at the Moscow Conference, in order to prevent the Soviet Union from feeling resentment, they tried their best to avoid mentioning it. From this, it can be seen that the British and American intentions are treacherous and their intentions are hypocritical and mutually wary. In order to understand the content and inside story of the three consecutive conferences of the Anti-Axis countries, a Central News Agency reporter specially visited Mr. Kishi, the Information Minister of the Japanese Embassy, yesterday. I was honored to receive the following remarks: "The Anti-Axis forces held a meeting in Moscow at the end of October, a British-American-Chongqing meeting in Cairo in November, and a meeting in Tehran thereafter. Looking at the contents of their military statements, compared with the moral spirit of the Greater East Asia Declaration, it is actually dwarfed. Their utilitarian thoughts, conflict of interests, and opposition of opinions make it easy to see the whole picture. If we examine the contents of their three meetings, we will be able to find out the British and American conspiracy to sacrifice others for their own use. The motive of the meetings seems to be to negotiate, but in fact it symbolizes their impatience caused by the recent series of defeats. The recent unparalleled victories won by the Japanese side in the South Pacific, and the closer unity of the countries of Greater East Asia after the publication of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, have given the Anti-Axis powers a great shock. In order to resist the final doom, they do not hesitate to use despicable means and resort to this last resort. The main issues of the Cairo and Moscow-Tehran conferences were the interests of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Forcing the Chongqing side to participate was actually fearing its awakening. This is a conspiracy of the Anti-Axis powers, and it is not difficult to imagine that there are different opinions within. Recently, Smuts gave a speech in London, expressing the opinion of the British, American, and Soviet 'Trinity', saying that the result of this Second World War must be that the three great powers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union will dominate the world. According to Smuts, a powerful figure in the Anti-Axis front, his public speech actually despised Chongqing. From this, we can see the true intentions of the United States and the United Kingdom towards Chongqing. The Tehran Conference was a conspiracy of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, so they tried their best to avoid Chongqing's participation. Among them, the opening of the first battlefield, etc., had no practical results, and were equal to the empty content of the Moscow Conference. We can really laugh at the treacherous tricks of the Anti-Axis powers who are suspicious of each other and conspire against each other."</p>

In short, Japan's financial strength has been able to meet the needs of financial industry, and the situation is very stable.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Between the Two Armies on the Kiev Highway Until Dawn, German Army Launched Counterattack on the Southern Route</h3>
<p>Moscow, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Battle of Kiev has now entered its fifth week, with a sense of resurrection. This battle can still represent the large-scale offensive of the German army in the eastern front, in order to counter the advance of the Soviet army towards Baghdad and Odessa. According to Soviet intelligence, there was fierce fighting on the Kiev Highway southwest of Malin (46 kilometers from Kiev) until dawn. Further south, after the Soviet army withdrew from the town of Radomyshl, it gathered its defense forces on the east bank of the Teterev River. Both sides are replenishing their forces and waiting in battle formation.</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Havas News Agency: Since yesterday, the Dnieper River has become the focus of the German counterattack. The German army launched an attack from the west and advanced towards Kirovograd, meeting the flanks of General Konev's troops attacking south, so General Konev's plan to advance towards Krivoy Rog has been temporarily frustrated. Moreover, this counterattack by the German army has also temporarily reduced the pressure on the German positions in Kirovograd. After the enemy in the central route had been advancing for many days between the Pripyat River and the Berezina River, it suddenly shifted its troops to the west and attempted to break into the confluence of the Sluch River and the Werschniza River, launching an attack on the German army. The German defenders were vigilant and immediately frustrated the attack. The enemy in the Navel direction continued to increase its reinforcements for the battle, and is still fighting fiercely, but there is no major change in the positions.</p>

<h3>German Troops in Italy Conduct Elastic Defense Warfare - US Army Drives French Mercenaries as Cannon Fodder</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - German News Agency: After several days of calm, intense warfare resumed on Tuesday in the area held by General Clark's US Fifth Army on the southern Italian front. The US troops on the western front have been reinforced by troops from Trgorsk in recent days. General Clark seems to be planning to transport French reserves from North Africa to southern Italy in addition to the Moroccan Second Infantry Division, as he clearly wants to conserve the US divisions, which have suffered heavy casualties. The US command seems to be imitating Montgomery's precedent, as General Montgomery ordered all purely British troops to withdraw from the front line, while Canadian, New Zealand, and Indian troops fought in the area held by the British Eighth Army. On Tuesday, the US Army probed the German lines with strong shock troops and reconnaissance detachments. At the same time, the British Eighth Army and its overseas troops expanded their bridgehead to the area outside the Moro River at a high price. After six hours of heavy artillery preparation, the British assault teams launched a fierce attack on the German lines on the eastern flank. A fierce battle immediately unfolded throughout the area, but in general, the enemy's fierce attacks were blocked by the tenacious elastic defense of the German army.</p>

<h3>The Collapse of the Enemy's General Counteroffensive - A Dialogue Between Colonel Kurihara, Head of the Naval Reporting Section of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, and Colonel Matsumura, Head of the Army Reporting Section</h3>
<p>Making the Possible Possible</p>
<p>Colonel Matsumura: I agree, I agree. What the United States excels at is material, and what Japan excels at is people. Human intelligence, human power, is where the Japanese are most adept. We should develop it to the maximum to compensate for our weakest points. Regarding the human element, which is where Japan excels, we should further develop our strong spiritual power and further stimulate morale. As for the production front, although material is needed, things like breaking through bottlenecks can also be achieved through the power of the human spirit.</p>
<p>Some people tend to think that Japan cannot compare with the United States in terms of material resources. In fact, one of the characteristics of this war is the air war. Therefore, in order to intercept the counterattacks of the United States and Britain, we must also focus on aircraft. If we also focus on the ships that transport war materials from the south, then although the United States considers itself the arsenal of the world, it must also attend to Europe, the Soviet Union, and the Mediterranean. Therefore, even though its productive capacity is strong, as long as Japan's industrial warriors do their best, it is not impossible to compete with them in East Asia. Losing in terms of material resources is due to a lack of effort, and what is deplorable is the lack of effort. Despair is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Colonel Kurihara: I think so too. Japan has already established a self-sufficient economic sphere. If we examine this self-sufficient economy, there will be no difficulties in terms of material even if we fight a war two or three times greater than today. As for manpower, with our single Yamato race at the center, the peoples of Greater East Asia are gladly cooperating and moving forward. In this light, there is no shortage of either manpower or material resources. So, what about production equipment? Frankly speaking, until the start of the war, this was Japan's major weakness, and it is difficult to deny it.</p>
<p>At that time, although various products were made, if you looked closely, all the manufacturing machines were bought from the United States, Britain, and Germany. No matter how difficult a part was to make, we would go to the United States and Britain to buy it. Although we could make it ourselves, it was cheaper to buy it than to make it ourselves. Of course, this is open to criticism, but we bought it simply because buying was cheaper than making it ourselves.</p>
<p>However, once the United States implemented an economic blockade, we could no longer buy anything. So the Japanese unleashed their latent power and started manufacturing themselves, and that is the situation today. As a result, everything is complete in all aspects. So, we have materials, we have people, and we have equipment. What is lacking is effort. Recently, regarding the so-called "bottleneck," some people have said, "The bottleneck is effort." In the past, when we could not buy imported goods, some people said, "The bottleneck is using our ingenuity." I think this is absolutely true. Considering today's Japanese system, there is nothing that makes the impossible possible; it is only making the possible possible. Isn't this the state of affairs in Japan today? From this point of view, as long as we make an effort in this war, the future is truly bright.</p>
<p>In short, whether in terms of war resources or manpower, as long as we make an effort, it is possible to surpass the enemy's production expansion. Therefore, not only we Japanese, but also all the peoples of Greater East Asia, must become one for this purpose. Since the Greater East Asia Conference, this atmosphere seems to have become very strong. Colonel Matsumura is an expert in this area, so let's hear a grand theory...</p>
<p>The Loftiness of the Greater East Asia Declaration</p>
<p>Colonel Matsumura: The five principles announced at the Greater East Asia Conference are: coexistence and co-prosperity, independence and amity, promotion of culture, economic prosperity, and contribution to world evolution. These principles were unanimously approved by all the representatives and announced as the guiding principles for the construction of Greater East Asia. This can be said to be a new Magna Carta in international relations, and I think it can regulate future international relations.</p>
<p>These five principles are completely different from the Anglo-American idea of maintaining the status quo based on their own interests. They are truly about coexistence and co-prosperity, and they are about opening up resources, exchanging cultures, and contributing to the evolution of the world. So, it can be said that there has never been such a magnificent declaration. Regarding the practical expression of these principles, there are facts such as the new Sino-Japanese Treaty, the independence of the Philippines, and the independence of Burma. From this, we can see that they are by no means a mere scrap of paper, as the Americans and British say, but have real power. They are not only being implemented now, but can also be implemented in the future.</p>
<p>After the Greater East Asia Conference, a Greater East Asia Ethnic Solidarity Conference was held in Hibiya. The magnificent spirit of the representatives and their will to build Greater East Asia were truly inspiring. In particular, what Ba Maw and Chandra Bose said, even if people who heard it did not agree, could promote the solidarity of Greater East Asia. In this way, Greater East Asia, which had been abused until now, has returned to its original state, and the unification of one billion people is about to be completed. In short, construction has been established. Just as the United States and Britain need time, Japan is also growing stronger day by day. The southern resources you mentioned earlier are truly enormous military resources, and as long as we give it time, they can all be transformed into combat power. It is also a fact that the United States and Britain have long feared the underlying strength of Japan in building Greater East Asia. Therefore, on the other hand, they are racking their brains, wanting to launch counterattacks and decisive battles before these resources are transformed into Japanese combat power. This is the current situation.</p>
<p>Colonel Kurihara: The Greater East Asia Declaration is indeed a magnificent idea. Compared with the ideas of the United States and Britain, there is a world of difference. I am afraid that the Americans and British will not understand such a lofty spirit. Therefore, they are in a hurry to launch a counterattack against Japan. What they are doing is nothing more than fearing that great idea. Only those with a relatively developed culture can understand such a sublime idea. The United States and Britain are utilitarian and materialistic, so even though they sometimes say nice things, there is not a single thing they do that matches their words. But Japan always does what it says. I think that the greatness of Japan lies in this, and the people of the world will surely understand this greatness. Isn't this the time when Japan's spirit of "Hakkō ichiu" is truly communicated?</p>
<p>Japan's Strengths</p>
<p>Colonel Kurihara: If you look at the thoughts of other countries, although they talk a good game, in reality they have no substance. They often talk about equal opportunity and open doors, but this is actually a form of American aggression. Even the Monroe Doctrine they talk about is just a form of aggression. The United States uses the banner of the Monroe Doctrine to carry out the reality of aggression in South America and prevent anyone else from interfering. This is an extremely clever calculation. As for their advocacy of equal opportunity and open doors in the Orient, its meaning is nothing more than "we are going to invade the Orient in the future."</p>
<p>Colonel Matsumura: Looking at the history of the American invasion of Manila, it is truly tragic. In order to start the Spanish-American War, the United States did not hesitate to sink a cruiser itself. In order to gain a foothold in the Orient, the United States designed to start the Spanish-American War in this way. Afterwards, they used the good bait of allowing the Philippines to become independent to lure the Philippine army into resisting the Spanish army. When the US Army arrived from the mainland one after another, and there was no need for the Philippine army, they refused to allow them to enter Manila, which eventually provoked the Philippine-American War. At that time, as many as 600,000 civilians were massacred by the US Army, which is probably unprecedented in human history. This history of atrocities is truly the world's number one. From this, you can see how cruel they are.</p>
<p>Colonel Kurihara: When I was a student at the Military Academy, I heard Admiral Suzuki Kantarō say this: Admiral Perry came to Japan with the purpose of invading Japan. But why didn't he invade Japan and return home empty-handed? It turned out that when Perry landed in Japan, the wife of a Japanese fisherman was leading a toddler to watch their parade. Unexpectedly, her child tripped over a stone, and she kicked the stone away. Then the child laughed and followed along. When Perry saw this scene, he realized that the Japanese were scary. That is to say, he saw the scene of the mother kicking the stone away and the child laughing, and he knew that if he provoked a people with a strong spirit of resistance, the consequences would be very serious. So he dispelled the idea of invasion and obediently returned home. Since Perry, the path they have taken has been the path of aggressors. At the same time, we Japanese have an inherent hatred and aversion to those who are unethical, even three- or four-year-old children have it. And today, it is time for the blood of hatred to boil for the long-term aggression and immorality of the United States. Recently, the enemy's propaganda methods have also revealed their true colors.

<h3>Authorities Actively Dredging Material Sources in Various Regions - Inventory Quantities Must Be Reported by a Deadline</h3>
<p>According to sources revealed yesterday, in order to enrich the city's material reserves, the relevant authorities are actively dredging the sources of supplies to be transported to Shanghai for adjustment.

In order to understand the city's material reserves and facilitate unified allocation, the Municipal Bureau of Economy and other departments previously instructed the various trade associations to inform their member merchants to submit by a deadline the existing materials, items, quantities, storage locations, etc., categorized for verification. Yesterday it was learned that the various industries had already issued orders to handle this matter, but those who have not yet filled out the forms must complete these procedures within the recent period and must not deliberately delay. It is also learned that the city's material reserves are still abundant, and the future supply can be said to be secure. However, items such as rice are related to the source, so the reserves are slightly scarce.</p>

<h3>Seeking Remedial Measures for Fuel for Boiled Water Shops</h3>
<p>More than 1,000 boiled water shops throughout the city have been forced to suspend business due to their inability to obtain sufficient fuel. The Shanghai Special Municipality Boiled Water Trade Association, in view of the fact that boiled water is an essential beverage for citizens, convened a second board meeting at 2:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss how to remedy the situation. It was decided that since there is no definite date for the allocation of coal, representatives should be sent to Lianmei Coal Company to discuss an early allocation to meet urgent needs. It was also resolved that two directors, Jianming and Zhang Delong, should be responsible for contacting the coal ash supplier, since it is difficult for members to purchase coal ash.</p>
<h3>New Type of Trolleybus to Be Added to Service - Reconstructed from Former Public Buses</h3>
<p>According to the "Times" newspaper, a new type of trolleybus will be added to the streets of Shanghai in the spring of March or April, which will greatly improve the overcrowding situation. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, a large number of vehicles from the former Shanghai Public Concession China General Omnibus Company have been discontinued. These useless vehicles are now being completely refitted to become electrically powered trolleybuses. They will reappear on the streets of the city in late spring next year. As for the fact that bus motors and trolleybus parts are completely different, it is learned that this refitting work is extremely difficult, but after continuous efforts, one vehicle has been successfully refitted and has undergone numerous rigorous tests and is considered satisfactory. We hope that after these vehicles appear next year, the overcrowding situation on the city's trolleybuses will be greatly improved. The pain felt by office workers and small citizens who are unable to use high-priced vehicles is also the most profound, and we pray for its early realization.</p>
<h3>Contributing Salary to Help Students</h3>
<p>Our newspaper received letters yesterday from Mr. Xu Wenzhao and Mr. Jiang Zhonghe: "Wenzhao and Zhonghe were recommended by the Cotton Textile Manufacturers Association to serve on the investigation committee for processors at the purchasing office of the National Commercial Control Association for cotton yarn and cloth. Now that the work of the committee has come to an end, the Commercial Control Association presented each committee member with a gift certificate worth 1,000 yuan. How dare we accept remuneration for serving the public? To refuse would be disrespectful. Therefore, we exchanged the gift certificates for 2,000 yuan in cash and attach it to this letter to help with the newspaper's student aid program." Also yesterday, Mr. Chen Jinji donated 5,000 yuan to the newspaper's student aid fund, demonstrating his enthusiasm for helping students and benefiting the poor. We deeply admire him. The following is a list of student aid funds received yesterday: Chen Jinji, 5,000 yuan; Xu Wenzhao and Jiang Zhonghe (contribution from the Commercial Control Association's remuneration), 1,000 yuan each; Yuan Hui, younger brother of Xiao Yi, and Mr. Zhou, 200 yuan each; Wang Zhen, 150 yuan; Zheng Qiang and Chen Xin Button Factory, 100 yuan each; Ms. Wang De (delivered by Mr. Sun Choucheng), 50 yuan; Liu Anbang and Chen Ziqiao (delivered by Mr. Sun Choucheng), 45 yuan each; Guo Arong, 25 yuan; Zhang Ziqing, 20 yuan; Yan Yunxi and Zhou Yingqing, 5 yuan each. The amount of stored vouchers received was 8,155 yuan, and the remaining balance was 1,176,921 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes Can Be Transported Freely Within Three Provinces and Two Cities - No Need to Apply for a Permit</h3>
<p>Explanation of the National Commercial Control Association on the transportation of cigarettes: Answer to the Dahu Sales Company: Although cigarettes are a major commodity, transportation from the Shanghai area to three provinces and two cities does not require a permit from this association according to regulations.

<h3>Guangtian Information Minister Discusses the World Situation: Firmly Believes Anglo-American Plans Will Be Difficult to Realize</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch: The regular press conference hosted by the Shanghai office of the Japanese Embassy was held at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 16th) on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road. Information Minister Guangtian and Deputy Consul Fu were present. Minister Guangtian then delivered the following speech on the current world situation:</p>
<p>The Tripartite Alliance Becomes Stronger</p>
<p>Minister Guangtian began by saying: The current world situation is undergoing countless changes in military, political, economic, and diplomatic aspects. I will specifically analyze and clarify this. Generally speaking, the counteroffensive by the anti-axis powers, which began this spring, has now come to an end. Therefore, various parties are harboring doubts about the development of the counteroffensive in East Asia and Europe. However, from the perspective of the Axis powers, Japan and Germany, in addition to defending against the counteroffensive of the anti-axis powers, are strengthening their combat power and planning to launch the next offensive. In other words, our Axis powers are waiting for a good opportunity to attack and have already prepared everything. Furthermore, regarding the general state of the current war, the cooperation between Japan and Germany in political and diplomatic affairs is even closer and more solid. At the same time, Mr. Mussolini's new Fascist Italian Republican government has adopted its consistent policy and is determined to complete the war together with Japan and Germany. From this, it can be seen that the relationship between the three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy is becoming increasingly strengthened. As for the war aims of the three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy, you are all well aware that they are to build a new world order, which is now gradually being realized. Therefore, this point is a prominent feature in the Axis powers' political and diplomatic affairs.</p>
<p>Establishing the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere</p>
<p>He next stated the aims of the Axis war, saying that everyone knows that the content of Japan's construction of a new order in East Asia is to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In addition, various aspects such as politics, economy, and culture are all sought. The most fundamental issue concerns political demands. The Greater East Asia Conference, a grand meeting unprecedented in world history, was held in Tokyo, and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration was issued, which detailed the situation quite thoroughly. In short, it has broken away from the colonial state of Britain and the United States and ensured the realization of independence and autonomy. Therefore, the construction of a new order in East Asia is not only applicable to the countries of East Asia, but also extends to Arabia, Iran, Iraq, and the countries of West Asia. Regarding the economy, East Asia should break free from the exploitation of Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands. The economic power of East Asia itself should be fully applied to the construction of East Asia, so that the lives of the people of East Asia are stable. This is the goal of building a new economic order in East Asia. In order to achieve this goal, we must strive for victory. Therefore, we should make every effort to establish an economic organization. Regarding culture, I have a clear ideal for building a new cultural order in East Asia. At present, during the intense war, ordinary people may mistakenly think that cultural work is unimportant. However, cultural work and combat are parallel policies. Therefore, building a new cultural order in East Asia depends on strengthening the spirit. Therefore, we should establish a new order of East Asian spiritual culture.</p>
<p>Restoring East Asian Thought</p>
<p>Regarding the establishment of the East Asian spirit, some people think that learning from British and American culture, following behind them, and developing their own culture is a mistake that should be eliminated. Instead, we should restore East Asian thought and establish it. This is a necessary thing, not only in peacetime but especially in wartime. Therefore, the construction of a new order in East Asia can also be applied to Germany's construction of a new order in Europe. Although the content is slightly different, the spiritual goals of both sides are the same. In particular, the construction of a new order in Europe is to protect the development of European politics, economy, and culture. Its concept should also be in line with the content of the new order in East Asia. Therefore, the principles of both sides are applicable to the construction of a new world order. Therefore, the goal of the Axis powers is to establish peaceful lives for all nations in the world. Looking at the goals and actions of the anti-axis powers, their plans are to exploit all nations, protect their own rights and interests, and oppress small and weak nations. At the recent conferences held by the anti-axis powers in Cairo and Tehran, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union conspired to compress Japan's territory in East Asia and force it to become a third-rate country. In addition, they also restrained China, making China and Japan equal forces and continuing to confront each other permanently. If this attempt were to be realized, all the people of East Asia would be arbitrarily oppressed and exploited by Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Anglo-American Conspiracy Exposed</p>
<p>At the Cairo Conference, the result of their discussion on economic matters was the proposal to develop China's resources. Therefore, China is completely subjected to the economic oppression and exploitation policies of Britain and the United States. With Song Ziwen as the center, Song is a pro-American faction. This move not only opposes the construction of East Asia, but also uses funds to control China, making China a dependency of Britain and the United States. The oppression of China by Britain and the United States is actively proceeding. We can also feel the suffering of the Philippines, Burma, India, and the South Seas, which have suffered from the harm of Britain and the United States in the past. Looking at the situation in Europe, the British and American sides, under the guise of restoring democracy, are actually engaging in conspiracies and deception. Even the Bartoreo regime in Italy and the de Gaulle and Giraud factions in France have failed to achieve complete unity and are becoming increasingly severe. Moreover, they are tacitly approving the communization of Europe. In short, the anti-axis powers are destroying all nations in the world, using all kinds of despicable methods, especially in politics, economy, and culture, destroying the organization and unity of all nations. This matter was revealed in a speech by former South African Prime Minister Smuts on November 26 of this year, saying that other countries besides Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will be destroyed. Their conspiracy has been exposed. We firmly believe that the plans of Britain and the United States will be difficult to realize. Even looking at the current war, it is enough to prove that the war between Germany and the Soviet Union, especially the Eastern Front, is still in a stalemate. Regarding the Italian front, there is no progress. In addition, the entry of Turkey into the war and the landing in the Balkans have achieved nothing. In the Pacific, the Anglo-American counteroffensive and the Burmese front have suffered heavy blows.</p>

<h3>Commentary: The People's Livelihood Problem</h3>
<p>The theme for the essay contest organized by this newspaper for the New Year's Day of the 33rd year of the Republic of China is specifically focused on the people's livelihood problem, because nothing is more closely related to the people and the public than this problem. What is the people's livelihood problem? People's livelihood is the people's life, the survival of society, the nation's livelihood, and the lives of the masses. It is also the center of politics and economics.</p>
<p>The focus of solving the people's livelihood problem lies in how to solve the four basic needs of life: clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Therefore, in the announcement of this newspaper's essay contest, we specifically cited examples such as the distribution of cotton cloth, increased grain production, improvement of housing rentals, and transportation. Because all such problems are the crux of the wartime people's livelihood problem today. For example, when it comes to the distribution of cotton cloth, how should the distribution plan be written to be ideal? How should cotton cloth production be promoted to strengthen the future of distribution? When it comes to increased grain production, what kinds of regulations should be enacted in politics and law to protect farmers, so as to encourage their production and increase the agricultural products they produce? When it comes to housing rentals, how should the government authorities enforce the "Wartime Rental Law" to reduce the oppression and burden suffered by the common people from the landlord class? When it comes to improving transportation, are there the best methods for grain transportation that can clear its sources? How should public travel be improved to reduce its suffering? The above-mentioned points are only illustrative examples. The solutions to all other problems related to the four needs of clothing, food, housing, and transportation rely on the collective wisdom of the public, so as to provide a reference for the authorities.</p>
<h3>Stock Exchange Strictly Prohibits Stock Brokers from Deliberately Raising Market Prices; Does Not Restrict Legitimate Stock Price Increases</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Chinese stock market in this city's Chinese Stock Exchange, trading has increased substantially. Because the exchange has received inquiries from various parties saying that the exchange's brokers are being contacted by people who are deliberately suppressing the market price of their stocks and transferring them to the brokers, and giving them special benefits, thereby making their stocks rise higher and higher in order to profit from it. This kind of activity may have other purposes and is similar to covert speculation and manipulation. The exchange yesterday earnestly advised all brokers not to be greedy for small profits, to take care of their own credit and stabilize the market price, and to refuse to cooperate with those who deliberately raise stock prices. Otherwise, they will be severely punished in accordance with the provisions of Articles 32 and 71, Item 1 of the business rules. It is also clarified that legitimate stock price increases are not restricted.</p>
<h3>Bank of Communications Plans to Establish Agricultural Economic Offices in Various Places</h3>

Grades D and E bonds each fell slightly.</p>
<p>Silver Interbank Lending: The interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association last night suddenly increased by one minute, to 17%. The silver market seemed to be more active.</p>
<p>Grain: The market conditions yesterday unanimously rose sharply. The rice market rose sharply due to the lack of incoming goods and the enthusiastic purchases by citizens. The quoted price rose sharply, significantly higher than before. Oil merchants also continued to raise prices, showing an upward trend.</p>
<p>Rayon: The market yesterday slightly improved. Traders were still cautious and trading had not yet started, making it difficult to rise excessively. The last price of 120s Tianqiao was slightly over six.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities: Candle prices hit new highs again, with few sales. There were prices but no market. The prices of matches and soap remained the same as the previous day.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>Mr. Jin Zongcheng, Mr. Zhang Wenkui, Mr. Chen Kechang, and other figures in the financial community of this city have initiated the organization of the Greater China Automobile Co., Ltd., which has already begun to raise capital.

This is because the purpose of the company is different from that of ordinary automobile companies in the market, which specialize in business trips. Its main business is to operate various automobiles and all their accessories, and to manufacture coal-fired oil-substituting furnaces and alcohol gasifiers, in order to become a large-scale automobile company independently operated by the Chinese.</p>

<h3>Should Night Schools Restrict Electricity Use?</h3>
<p>— Cold Eyes</p>
<p>Shanghai is a decadent society. In this extraordinary period, everyone is still indulging in red wine and silk, singing and dancing, living a decadent life, which is really wrong. Now the authorities are strictly restricting electricity use, which is truly a good medicine to cure the decadent life of Shanghai people.</p>
<p>However, regarding the restriction of electricity use, I also have some small opinions, that is, we cannot generalize the restrictions. For example, users who are really making efforts to save electricity and have already saved as much as they can, and further restricting them is simply equivalent to asking them not to use electricity; a user who does not usually save electricity, and now wants him to save electricity, then he is only suffering a little, and electricity can still be used. Isn't this very unfair? Shanghai society has many night schools because of its special circumstances. There is a close relationship between night schools and electric lights. Many night schools, in the past two years, due to the high prices and the authorities' repeated announcements restricting electricity use, have already been very frugal in their electricity use before this announcement. As far as I know, some tutoring schools used to use 70-watt light bulbs a year or two ago, but have now changed to 40-watt light bulbs in order to save electricity. If they are now asked to reduce further, it will have a great impact on the students' eyesight; reducing classrooms is simply impossible. So how can they save more? Even in terms of home use, I used to have three lights, which were 40 watts, 15 watts, and 5 watts, for a total of 60 watts. Now, because of financial difficulties, a year and a half ago, I had already reduced the 60 watts to one 5-watt light.</p>
<p>Restricting electricity use is of course possible, but I think the restrictions should depend on the place. For example, dance halls and such places are only for people who are full and not hungry. If we want to save electricity, these places should be paid attention to. Various clan halls, calling for guides and playing mahjong all night, are also places that make people's lives decadent. I think they should also be large mansions, with many rooms and few residents. Even if you ask them to save 90% of their electricity, they will not be without light.</p>
<p>In short, the authorities should have a strict plan when restricting electricity use. Otherwise, those who waste electricity will still have electricity to use, while those who have already been frugal will be living in a dark world. Furthermore, the authorities have already made regulations for the disputes between second landlords and third tenants, but the authorities must also make regulations for the method of water and electricity charges, so as to avoid endless disputes. This is related to local security!</p>

<p>— By Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Nine</p>
<p>In Zhenren's twelfth spring, the Gu family was all stable. They were all used to life without a father. And they were not the same as when their father was alive.</p>
<p>Such changes also occurred in Zhenren's young heart. The habit of smiling and showing his front teeth was still the same, but in that smile, there was a very strong and amazing resilience.</p>
<p>"Brother, why did you leave before me?"</p>
<p>One morning, his brother Taro went to school a step earlier than him, so he chased after him and protested like this. Because his tone was quite possessive, Taro couldn't answer him for a while.</p>
<p>Also, when he got to school, he would climb on the iron bars whenever he had free time. His apple-like face became even redder, and he勉强 rotated on the iron bars.</p>
<p>"Shrimp jumps into the cauldron, very fierce!"</p>
<p>No matter how much the children teased him, he did not stop calisthenics. It was not that he already liked calisthenics, but because he didn't like himself having unsatisfactory subjects.</p>
<p>Zhenren was unwilling to let others get ahead, from the bottom of his heart.</p>
<p>Don't succumb to others - since his father was gone, he didn't know when he had this idea. Although he was still a child, he also saw his mother's appearance of being busy all day long. He was also deeply moved by the actions of his older brother, 四吉, who did not say a word of complaint after dropping out of school and working in the store. Everyone seemed to be competing against something, all seemed to be resisting the bullying of outsiders.</p>
<p>"I can't succumb to others either."</p>
<p>He made up his mind in his small chest. The local custom was that no child was willing to let others get ahead, but few people had as strong a will as Zhenren. Although that was the case, he was not often seen quarreling with other children. Because there was no opportunity to quarrel. His unwillingness to let others get ahead was hidden in his gentle smile, so even those who were rough-tempered unconsciously passed by. The two famous children's games in Satsuma - "Seizing the General" and "No Begging for Mercy" - in this kind of pretend-quarreling situation, Zhenren's unwillingness to let others get ahead attracted the attention of the children.</p>
<p>"Seizing the General" was two classes of children, bare-chested, with headbands tied on their heads, fighting each other to protect their own general from being knocked down, mutually fighting and mutually defending. In other metropolitan elementary schools, this was a prohibited game. "No Begging for Mercy" was a struggle in which individuals were the unit, but it could also be a group. The two sides hit each other, and the side that said "beg for mercy" within a certain period of time lost. This was a traditional game for athletes, and it was still being carried on in elementary schools.</p>
<p>The thin and weak Zhenren was immediately knocked to the ground. After falling, he still had to resist for a long time.</p>
<p>"Beg for mercy?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>Even though his red face was pressed into the sand and his breath was almost suffocated, Zhenren did not beg for mercy. He could not be bullied.</p>

<h3>Family Fuel Saving Methods</h3>
<p>Recently, coal has been scarce and expensive, and users should urgently seek ways to save fuel. A few methods are listed below: Whether the type of stove is appropriate, whether the type of fuel is suitable, the size of the ventilation holes, the spacing of the furnace grate bars, whether adding coal is even and appropriate, and whether removing ashes is complete - all the advantages and disadvantages of the equipment and the skill of management are greatly related to fuel saving. All those in charge of such matters should pay attention at all times and closely monitor based on experience, so as to achieve the goal of frugality. Everyday washing can be changed to using cold water, which not only saves fuel, but also promotes the cold resistance of the skin and is beneficial to hygiene. If it is not possible to change immediately, you can first use warm water, then lukewarm water, and then change to cold water. Foods that do not need to be eaten hot can generally be eaten cold. All vegetables, meat, fish, and other items only need to be cooked thoroughly and cleanly to be hygienic, regardless of whether they are eaten hot or cold. Those who use bread instead of rice will find cold food more comfortable. If you find it too cold, you only need to use hot tea or hot soup to accompany it, and you will find it not difficult at all. All items that must be eaten hot should be eaten while they are still hot, and do not reheat them after they have cooled, which would waste fuel. All items that can be combined and cooked in one pot (such as steaming and stewing methods) should be combined and cooked in the same pot as much as possible to save fuel. Families with a small population can eat at the homes of nearby relatives and friends. As long as you are calm and peaceful, nothing is impossible to cooperate with, and you can achieve the effect of saving money. Those who live in the same house but get along well can jointly set up a cooking stove or jointly build a stove and share the costs equally. Try to save the time it takes to start a fire in the stove, and strive to complete tasks such as cooking rice, vegetables, and water continuously in the shortest possible time, and extinguish the fire as soon as the work is completed. If cooked food or hot water needs to be kept hot, you may want to prepare more insulated bottles or heat preservers (such as heat preservers made of straw nests, cotton wool, or asbestos) to store them.</p>

<h3>Impressions of the Eryou Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Manwen</p>
<p>The calligraphy, painting, and epigraphy exhibition hosted by the Hongying Library, gathering the finest works of over two hundred famous artists from across the country and exhibiting them at the China Art Gallery, deeply impressed this writer upon visiting yesterday. The walls were adorned with a dazzling array of beautiful works, incomparable to ordinary calligraphy and painting exhibitions.</p>
<p>Among the exhibitors were calligraphers such as Wang Fuchang, Ye Yuhu, Chen Taoyi, Shen Xinqing, Bai Jiao, Ma Gongyu, Fen Weng, and Feng Wenfeng; painters such as Xia Jiancheng, Tang Dingzhi, Feng Chaoran, Wu Daiqiu, Wu Hufan, Tang Yun, Zhu Yachen, Wu Qingxia, Zhou Lianxia, Gu Qingyao, Li Qiujun, Chen Xiaocui, and Pang Zuoyu, all well-known to society. Listing all of their works would be exhaustive. There were also rare and valuable pieces such as Dr. Mei Pohua's "Jin Mei" (Exhausted Plum Blossoms), couplets and scrolls by Jiang Zhuzhuang, Ma Xulun, Li Bake, Zhang Jusheng, and Yuan Xiluo. Various Hanlin scholars and grand historians also contributed works. Shen Maishi's landscapes and flowers, with brushwork and artistic conception that were both exquisite, belonged to an old master. Zhou Shushun's flowers and birds, with their colors and brushstrokes, were refined and transcendent, and hard to come by. Gu Yaojun's clerical script and Feng Wen's script could be called twin jade perfections. The calligraphy couplet of the twelve-year-old Chen Hanshi demonstrated mature brushwork. In addition, there was a special item displayed in the same cabinet as the epigraphy works: a handscroll in the Ouyang Xun style of calligraphy, an imperial edict bestowed upon the Gu family by the Wanli Emperor, priced at 250,000 yuan for a charity auction, making it an especially rare treasure.</p>
<p>It is said that all the proceeds from the sales will be used for the Hongying Library's expenses. Visitors and buyers have been coming in a continuous stream, both contributing to a charitable cause and feasting their eyes.</p>
