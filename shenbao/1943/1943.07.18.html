<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>政治的是非與民意上達</h3>
<p>— 陳孚木</p>
<p>近數年來一般政府當局似乎不大願意採納民間對政治的批評，所以我們常常聽到「政治是沒有是非可言的」一句話。他們的意思以爲政治旣無是非，那麼我們幹我們的算了，管人們批評不批評。但不要誤解，「政治無是非」這句話並不是一個在任何塲合都可以適用的定則。在通常的政治措施上，牠是絕對不能適用的。</p>
<p>能適用的，只是在那些歷史劇變的塲合。在那些塲合，一切舊制度都在淘汰，一切社會價値都在重新估定。在這樣否定一切，創造一切的塲合，政治當然是沒有是非可言的了。但這樣的塲合是曠代難逢的。近二世紀來，够得上說的，只有一七八九年法國的大革命和一九一七年俄國的大革命。</p>
<p>除了歷史劇變的革命塲合外，政治並不是沒有是非可言的。實際政治是注重事實的，注重效率的。因此，某一個政策之對與不對便可從其推行後的結果而決定，同時亦可從其推行期中對社會的影響而決定。結果的推斷雖或不易，但民間的反響總是不難測騐的。所以，是非的判斷，如果從民心的向背求之，則可思過半矣。簡單的說，以民心的向背爲依歸，這就是政治的公式。</p>
<p>政治總是離不開民衆的，政治的主要目的總是在爲人民謀福利的。因爲這緣故，當政者對於人民的切身利害總要時刻留心吧，對於人民政治上的意見總須要聽聽吧。不然，則政治根據什麼來改善呢？不然，政治必離開了人民，人民必離開了政府。這樣，人民與政府如何能打成一片？政府亦從何而獲有眞正的力量呢？我回想民國十四十五年的時候，國民政府還在廣州，還沒有誓師北伐，當時廣州的人民對政府隨時可以公開在報紙上批評。只要批評指摘得對，政府便根據民意在中央政洽會議提出改善的提案。那時，政府是跟人民走的，並沒有認爲接受人民的批評而改革政府的設施是「有損政府的威信」的。因爲這緣故，當時的民衆的確是和政府打成一片，而政府亦的確是得到人民熱烈的擁戴。憑藉着這樣的基礎，國民政府在萬難的環境中，以廣東一隅之地爲根據而能推動國民革命，決非偶然。可惜這個生氣蓬勃的時代只是曇花一現！以後，軍事雖獲成功，政治便日趨黑暗，於是採取新聞檢查制度而加緊箝制人民的言論了。</p>
<p>我個人對於近今的新聞檢查制度是抱着懷疑的態度的。教認爲新聞檢查制度的正當作用只有（一）防止惡意反對政府根本政策的言論：（二）防止洩露軍事消息；（三）防止煽動社會安寗的無稽謠言。除了這些之外給予社會人士相當的言論自由是應該的。比方說「中日和平」道是政府根本政策不容反對的，但並不是說主張中日和平的理論必須八股式篇篇雷同。在中日和平這大前提下不妨給人們盡情發揮種種不同的意見。因爲問題愈討論愈能接近實際。政治之事，「盲人騎瞎馬，夜半臨深池」已是够危險的了，又還塞着耳孔裝聾子，不聽旁人警告，那就更危險了。所以古之專制帝皇雖然家天下，仍然要養幾個骨氣嶙崢的諍臣在他左右，常常抽他的蹩脚，忠言規諫，引導人君施行仁政。我們看歷史每一朝代諍臣愈多，政治就修明，而國家也興盛。在近代的國家有議會，民意有時能經由議會以轉達於政府。現在中國還沒有議會，又沒有都老爺，御使之類，如果連報紙也限於只准做八股，作德政頌，試問政府的耳目在什麼地方？政治還有改善的希望嗎？</p>
<p>我認爲改變這種一貫的作風的時候現在應當是到了。自一月九日以來政府的任務已加重了。自一月九日以來政府是進入了與盟邦同生共死的階段了，政府和盟邦同生共死究竟憑的是什麼？當然憑的是人民的力量。旣要人民拿出力量去同生共死，最少，也得再鼓勵起民國十四五年時代國民政府在廣州和人民打成一片的精神，最少，也得恢復那時代的淸明的氣象，最少，也得學從前那樣容許人民對政治忠實的說話。能容許人民說話，社會才有淸議，官吏才受社會的督責，政治才能淸明，人民才願意和政府積極的合作，必須獲得人民積極的協力，政府才有眞正的力量。但要獲得人民的積極協力，唯一條件，就是容許人民在政治上說話——容許人民對政治作忠實的批評。</p>
<p>復次，對於政府現今的民衆運動的政策，我亦認爲是應當改變的時候了。民衆運動，顧名思義，應當是由民衆自己發動的。但現在的民衆運動是「官辦」的，這不必諱言。我認爲在現時的改變，最少亦應得改爲「官督民辦」，一方在宣揚政府的政策，一方在代表民衆的利益，站在民衆的立塲，代表民衆利益。代表民衆說話這一點都辦不到，則民衆運動根本是失其意義。而從事民衆運動的工作者，也只是變成了政府豢養着愚弄民衆的工具了。民意不能上達，則政治自日益黑暗。政治黑暗則民衆日益叛離，而政治將更加黑暗，兩走極端，而暴亂隨之矣。</p>
<p>近來頻頻聽到「國民革命再出發」的口號。如果是「由今之道」，民衆是決不會像前次出發那般熱烈的。我絕不隱諱，民衆是不必談了，就是智識階級現在亦是冷淡的。所以近來有些人們正在責備智識階級之不肯出而協力。我認爲這種責備是過於苛刻。「由今之道」，試問智識份子有什麼方法有什麼機會來協力。智識份子的協力是用其思想其意見來領導民衆去協力的，現在連發表思想意見的機會都沒有，還有什麼協力可說？如果現今的作風不改，而要智識份子協力，則只有那些荀子所謂「入於其耳，出於其口，耳與口間四寸耳」的「四寸之學」的「智識」份子才配出來協力。前好些時吉田東祐先生會有「中國智識階級的騎牆主義」一文，中國智識階級爲什麼變成騎牆主義？我以爲智識階級最可寳貴的口，因爲在這時代無所用，是最好的解釋。其實智識階級騎牆已經是很不錯的了，那智識份子如果對中日問題沒有相常認識，他絕不會把一隻脚仲到這邊來，至於另一隻脚怎樣，那就要看政治修明的程度，和能否讓他們的口與腦盡相當的義務了。</p>
<p>末了，我要重複的說明：政治並不是沒有是非可言的。老百姓認爲是就是是，認爲非就是非。善惡是非是由老百姓的向背爲準則的。</p>

<h3>周財長對日記者　談經濟財政設施　對中儲劵之發行決期其愼重　華中華北貿易實行物物交換</h3>
<p>南京十七日中央社電　日本讀賣報知新聞社記者　謁我國財政部長兼中央儲備銀行總裁周佛海，提出有關經濟問題多項，承周部長予以解答甚詳，茲誌大意中下：目前中國戰時經濟上之最大問題，厥爲物價問題，其解決方策，最要者爲增加生產，囤積物資，足以使物價昂騰，因而當局決定取締囤積，當可使物價趨於安定，並已組織物資調查委員會，進行調查囤積事件，對囤積者予以制裁，關於增　問題，目前主要困難，即爲原料與動力問題。其中動力之根源，煤之　量不足，實爲最大問題，今後當積極設法運入煤斤：關於籌集原料問題，刻正研究各項對策關於今後對日方交還之敵產營運方針，因與增　問題有關，故擬採取三項基本方針，加心運營。是即（一）發售，（二）委託經營，（三）租借。至於中國方面投資於合併公司者，實質上刻已成爲全都投資，但當此等公司交還國府管理之際，則當局對於民間投資，亦　歡迎，　接受一般民眾及有力人士之援助以言　備，各規　較小銀行問題與物價有關，故已修正過去之銀行法，其方針　於各銀行昔日之資本金爲五十萬元者，目前如不能增至三百萬元，是禁止　　關於吸取民眾資本之方策，擬恢復事　以來上海方面之證券交易所，刻正進行準備中。至於規定中儲劵之最高發行額問題，當中央儲備銀行成立之初，即有此議，然因實行上殊多　難，故　中儲劵之最高發行額，不予規定，但此並非將任意增發中儲劵，而後對於中儲劵之發行，決期其　重，關於華中華北間貿易問題，決實施物物交換制，至其數量，業經決定，刻正　　進行中至於國府之財政現狀，　異常建全，迄今從無入不敷出之現象。增稅問題目前亦在考慮中，當局之方針在實施增稅時，亦以不影響於物價爲原則。然就中國且　稅入而言，屬於直接稅者，僅有所得稅一項，故或增徵間接稅，但亦決不　稅增高過鉅。關於目前地方財政問題，其主要收入首爲田賦，將來擬加以整頓，以期收入增加。其他尚有營業稅，目前因成績欠佳，故正促有關方面積極整頓中，此外關於發行公債事，目前決不予考慮。</p>
<h3>汪主席蒞集訓營　續講新運綱要</h3>

<h3>北京鹽澤公使公畢返任</h3>
<p>日駐北京鹽澤公使，前因商討公務會來此間，頃已公畢，於十七日十午九時，自羽田啟程，經由新京歸任。</p>
<h3>京記者公會召開　收回滬租界座談會　對界內一切革新措施均有討論</h3>
<p>南京十七日中央社電　京市記者公會爲慶祝我國收囘上海公共租界，並就接收租界後租界內之一切行政·司法·經濟·文化·敎育等一般問題之革新措施，聆悉各有關機關長官之宏論起見，特於十七日下午三時，假座中日文化協會，舉行收囘上海公共租界座談會。計到有政府各有關機關長官最高法院院長張　，宣傳部次長郭秀峰，撤廢治外法權事務局局長喬萬選，內政部參事倪家福，社會福利部主任秘書黃慶中，敎育部秘書王一方，財政部賦稅司長費公俠，宣傳部事業司長楊鴻烈等廿餘人，下午三時座談會開始，由記者公會代表關竹邨致問會詞後，座談即行開始，各出席機關長官，對收囘上海公共租界後之經濟司法敎育文化等各問題，均有極詳細之說明，情緒至爲熱烈。至下午六時許，始圓滿散會。</p>
<h3>朝鮮中華商會　募獻國防金</h3>
<p>南京十七日中央社電，据朝鮮釜山消息，木浦中華商會曾募集國防購機金日幣一百元，又井邑中華商會亦募得國防購機金日幣五十元，該欵業已逕匯外交部，獻呈國府。</p>
<h3>粤省府訂定物資移動章程</h3>
<p>廣州十七日中央社電　本省自中央頒布戰時物資移動取締暫行條例後，即將物資配給委員會裁撤，並予本年五月間成立省經濟局，訂定廣東省戰時物資移動取締暫行章程，公佈施行。</p>
<h3>胡宗南等集議　武力制裁共軍</h3>
<p>南京十七日中央社電　渝方此次向中共要求解散陝甘寗邊區赤色政權及設防中共軍隊，就對外意義上視之，可顯示蘇聯在中國西北邊區勢力之引退，在對內意　上，則爲渝蔣擬加强專政，對中共在邊區之現狀不容默許，故渝方統一運動推進力之三民主義靑年團與中共之間在政治社會文化各方面展開猛烈之鬥爭。過去六年間國共兩黨之相尅，早已進入武力解決之階段。查渝共兩黨間之政治折衝，如延安方面不淸算其國際性，轉向國家中心主義改變其從未基於共產主義之外交文化經濟政策，則國共在各方面之對立抗爭，永將不斷發生。又在軍事上視之，最近「中共中央部」如不容納「國防最高委員會」之軍事統一要求，則駐在陝甘寗邊區之「渝中央軍」大部隊，致令其他戰區瀕於危機，亦不容默視。此種事態，共產軍搖亂渝軍後方，漠視渝「國防最高委員會」規定之軍隊編制，任意增强兵力至五十萬，其後增强之結果，眾料合計百二十萬以上，然其開赴前綫作戰者，不足三分之一，餘盤據於後方安全地帶以養成實力。渝西北軍政幹部胡宗南等本月十日在西安舉行軍事會議，席間竭力主張對「第十八集團軍」施行澈底武力制裁，以淸禍根。</p>
<h3>美駐渝空軍　處境困難</h3>
<p>廣州十七日中央社電　據渝息，駐渝美空軍上校霍塞特十四日接見合眾社記者時，曾暴露美駐渝空軍之不利態勢，茲誌共所談大意如次：捷諾特少將部下所有飛機之編成，至最近始達轟炸機一架對戰鬥機三架之比率，現在之實力，僅可維持守勢，故吾等較世界任何飛行隊爲困苦，由於中國之氣候不定，航行時極多危險，且無完全之飛行地圖，故其行動極少能率。又因人員不足，故此僅有之飛行士等，則須奔走終日，其苦勞實非故國人士所能想像。吾等最失望者，厥爲中國東海岸無基地，結果吾等轟炸敵機時，無論遭如何犧牲，終無效果，不能予日軍以大打擊。因此若不確保中國東海岸之基地，是現在吾等之努力實無意義。吾人亦不知爲何從事此等危機工作。</p>
<h3>河北日軍半年綜合戰果</h3>
<p>石門十七日中央社電　日軍部隊·自本年一月起，向河北省全境渝共軍展開殲滅戰，迄六月底止，獲得綜合戰績如次，敵交戰兵力二四二八七九名，交戰次數二〇五五七次，俘虜八八二九名，遺棄屍体一六七〇具，覆滅軍事設施五七六和，鹵獲迫擊砲八八尊，其他重機槍輕機槍步槍彈藥等甚夥。</p>
<h3>活躍於農村建設的崗位上　首都建村農學院巡禮</h3>
<p>— 敬遠</p>
<p>在振興農村，增產食糧的口號下，許多人的目光，都集中到農業上去。當然，今日的中國農村，是落後的，是殘破的，要它在總力參戰的體制中，担負起食糧供給的任務，那必須在農村建設的工作上，具真心，用全力的下一番工夫。</p>
<p>事變前，山東的鄒平，河北的定縣，江蘇的徐公橋，都有農建實騐，戰後，代之而起的，在南京，有中國靑年工讀團。</p>
<p>中國靑年工讀團，其主要工作分着三個部分，一是訓練從事農村建設的幹部人才，二是實騐農村建設的各種體制，三是研究農業改良的諸般技術。建村農學院，便是該從事第一種工作的一個機構。</p>
<p>建村農學院在南京繡巷，周圍近百畝的空地，是李相國花園的遺址，現在都給該院闢作花標本區，試騐區，所以花木扶疏，菜蔬滿圃，頗饒田園的風味。院舍是民房改建，有一百餘間，除了辦公室，敎室，寢室，禮廳，飯堂等外，各種實騐室，農具室，種籽室，昆蟲飼養室，農產製造室，倉庫，畜舍等，佔據了很大的面積。在設備方面，該院歷年所費的已超過三百五二萬元，因此可以說相當的完備。</p>
<p>編制方面，和普遍農學院一樣，分作物，園藝，畜牧，森林，農業敎育，蠶桑六系，因爲設備關係，現在先設作物，園藝，農敎三系。學生共有一百二十人，本學期預備招新生五十人。</p>
<p>作爲特點的是該院所創制訓練方式，該院以工讀敎育爲標榜，而以敎室，實騐室，農塲，農村四位一体爲口號，除了極少數的抽象科目外，一切學科，都有比上課時間更多更好實騐時間只懂理論而不會實騐的學生，不能得到該科目的及格分數。在每天下午五點鐘以後，全體學生，就要走出敎室，到農塲上去，他們穿着農裝，光着頭，赤着脚，黎黑的皮膚和粗大的手掌，已經看不出大學生的模樣了。該院附近近百畝的農塲，以及附設牧塲中十餘頭奶牛，五六隻乳羊，二百多頭盎哥拉兎，三十餘隻豬，數百隻鷄鵝鴨等經常的各項工作，均由全體學生來負担。墾荒，犂地，施肥，播種，中耕，除虫，防病，刈割，磨礱，整枝，飼養，放牧，交配，擠乳，消毒，送奶等等，每個學生，都輪流的去担任。同時，除了農塲服務外，院內的操作，像淸潔烹飪，侍應，繕寫等，也並不假手他人。因此該院的工人和職員，比一般機關都特別的少。</p>
<p>熟習了農業技術，是否能保證學生將來有到農村去服務，還是問題。因爲該院位在都市中，學生和真正的農村沒有接觸，結果還是隔膜而不能適應的。因此，該院特在全部的訓練時期中，劃出一個學期，叫做農村生活實踐。叫學生住到工讀團設立的小行山模範農村實騐區去，與農民們同起居，共生活，真切的體騐到農村的實况。</p>
<p>此外，該院還有一個特點，就是終年不放假，　但沒有寒暑假，連星期也沒有。一方面，固然是配合着農村生活的習慣，另一方面，也可以縮短修學年限，四年的大學課程，可以在三年中修學。敎育改制聲中，該院的實騐，是値得注意的。</p>
<p>院長陳端志，過去是一位社會科學家，同時也是一個苦幹勁十足人物。他是辭去了一切官職而專心致志的幹這件事業。敎導長鐵明，作物系主任顧復，園藝系主任湯銘新，敎授王歷農，邵仲香，童玉民，顧伯明，劉玉斌等，都是農業界的權威學者，爲該院所搜羅，陣容相當整齊。雖然隻有短短三年的歷史，但該院確已奠定了不拔的基礎，不愧爲訓練農村工作幹部人才的大本營，亦爲今日農村建設途程中的一顆彗星！</p>
<h3>日內閣編成兩項預算案　富有伸縮性以便適應戰局</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　日政府爲謀適應大東亞戰爭之決戰階段起見，遂於十五日召開之例閣議商議，（一）關於昭和十九度預算之編成，（二）昭和十九度重要事項預算統制大綱兩項義案，當由賀屋藏相及鈴太企劃院總裁，分別加以說明後，予以決定，并根據此方針，作成明年度之必勝預算。此事已於十六日經日情報局詳爲發表，按明年度預算方針，較諸往年當有顯著之變異，關於爲增强戰力之緊急企業整備食糧增產等項施策，前於臨時追加巨額之預算，現似已見諸實行，此較過去僅注重應付長期戰者，顯有不同，故乃作民此適應戰局而富有伸縮性之預算，今僅以十九年度編成預算之方針，及重要事項預算統制大綱，與去年度之比較加以檢討，按於去年度之閣議中，係以增加人口及振興刷新敎育，以備長期戰爲主要，預先曾劃定恊議之事項，但於十九年度即已加以改正，以便增強戰力上緊要之科學技術與研究特殊不足物資之增產，以及澈底增强海陸空各方面之運輸力，爲最重要之事項，此實應注意關於經費一項，去年度係以極力抑制經費之膨脹，爲主要方針，而十九年度則不計較經費之多少，唯注重是否能賴以收實效，至於增强戰力上認爲必要者，即予勵行，此外追加巨額預備金，以備臨機施策之用，其積極性可知一斑。</p>
<h3>日減低錫販賣價格</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　日商工省已決定減低錫之販賣價格，並已指令日本金屬配給統制有限公司（全國金屬統制機關），自今日起，實施其改正價格，爲每一百瓩，一號錫四百三十元，二號錫四百十元，約比以前價格減低百分之四十八。按以前之公定價格乃大東亞戰爭爆發之前十一月所決定者，當時根據日國內所需，百分之九十須任諸馬來棉蘭邦加島等地之情形，乃決定一號錫爲八百三十元，今佔全世界產錫百分之六十七之南方產錫地，已完全入於日軍政支配下，故其價格之減低，實所必然。</p>
<h3>德人投効海軍爲數極眾</h3>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電　德國新聞社海軍記者韓森宣稱，德國海軍每有一空缺，輒有三四人志願充任，因此海軍之招募部，常能維持其選擇招募之原則。志願者係依照其志向而被分配於各部門服役。招募部現時熱烈歡迎年靑而有技術訓練之志願者投效，蓋德潛艇之擴大活動，此項人材，尤爲需要。各處德國海陸軍之靑年軍人，皆常申請調至潛艇服務，於此可見德國靑年之熱中於航海云。韓森又云，渠曾與在訓練之海軍新兵談話，此輩新兵百五十人中有十七人係從其他軍隊轉至海軍者，彼等已受普通之軍事訓練，再經短期之特別訓練，即可派赴軍站服役。</p>

<h3>泰首相廣播稱　英美從事宣傳　並無真正作戰實力　不能與德相提並論</h3>
<p>盤谷十七日中央社電　泰首相畢本，於十六在盤谷廣播電台以「關於今日之戰爭」爲題，發表廣播演講，要旨如次，在英國支配下之英國各廣播電台，近紛紛廣播西西里島登陸戰之消息，謂英國已獲大捷，但事實確尚在繼續戰鬥中，余之信念，適與其相反，認爲英軍定將重蹈鄧扣克大敗之覆轍，蓋在開戰之初，英國並未以兵士直接參加戰鬥，而法國作戰之結果，一敗塗地，毫無所獲。當法國正從事努力加强，爲圖保持勢力均衡起見，乃對法施以種種壓迫，及至戰事開始以後，英國仍按兵不動，亦不以援軍助法，坐視成敗，雖至最後，其輸送之兵力，亦不足三十萬，以此微薄之兵力，焉得與德軍抗衡，故終招致鄧扣克之慘敗。茲再轉而一觀東亞方面，英國在開戰之初，認本身足可防禦香港新加坡，及太平洋上之各屬島，其所出動之兵力，不及五十萬，餘爲澳洲兵力與印度兵，故開戰未及半截，其兵力悉被殲滅凈盡，除澳洲印度外，所有英國在東亞之屬地，悉爲日軍佔領。英國於東亞方面戰敗後，已一無所有，故不得不退避本土島國之中。英國之地位，在此次之戰爭中，不僅已使其海上之權力，完全喪失，且多數小國，已離去，迄今猶供英國之野心而犧牲者，尚有美國渝方及其他小國，此等國家，嘗與法國，比利時荷蘭波蘭及希臘等國，同樣爲英國而戰，付出慘重之犧牲。英國則常以極微之力量作戰，英國除不列顚島外，無作戰之餘力，英美兩國，因並無作戰之眞正實力，故彼等乃施用宣傳戰爭，關於瓜達爾卡納爾島，阿圖島西西里島之登陸作戰消息，世人聞之生厭，彼等所誇稱之島嶼，其實尚不及湄南河入口處科罷江島之重要。英美之戰法，與軸心軍戰法之不同，即彼等僅爲宣傳而軸心軍則與此相反，祗認真從事作戰，并不宣傳，軸心軍佔領巴黎新加坡時，並未實行何等擴大宣傳，而彼等則「勝利勝利」宣傳不已，然實際佔領何處乎，則僅爲毫無戰略價値之太平洋上一孤島耳。惟其宣傳，則儼若如何驚天動地之大事者，英美現正於特殊地點，企圖獲得勝利，例如據英方之報吿，其正使用二千餘船舶，企圖佔領如西西里之一小島，且即此微末作戰，彼等實已準備二年以上，該島是否且有如此之價値，即彼等自身亦大爲懷疑。彼等既爲宣傳而戰爭，則吾人對其此種勝利之幻夢，殊不能不懷疑也。</p>
<h3>泰宣傳局長　應邀赴日訪問　會見記者團發表談話　認泰須與日緊密恊力</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　泰國宣傳局長白樂德與泰新聞恊會會長浦利卡二氏，近應日天羽情報情報局總裁邀，特來日祝察決戰下日本之宣傳機構。已於日前抵此，昨（十六）日下午四時，於此間帝國飯店會見記者團，與記者問答如次，下爲樂德宣傳局長作答，（問）請略述泰國宣傳機構之概要。（答）泰國之宣傳局，大致與貴國相同，宣傳機關必須緊密聯絡，共策宣傳業務，現在泰國宣傳局之機構，概分秘書，新聞，廣播，技術，啟發宣傳，外事六課。但關於泰國啟發宣傳之情况，尚未臻完善地步。（問）請略述泰國對完遂大東亞戰爭之方策。（答）完遂大東亞戰爭之政策，其要點有二，一即保持與日本緊密之恊力，一即指導泰國民使能適應時局，又浦利卡新聞恊會會長與記者問答　次：（問）泰國新聞恊會之組織如何，（答）泰國之新聞恊會，或稱爲新聞記者恊會，較爲適宜，蓋爲一盡力輔佐政府施政之一團體。（問）請略述馬來四州及揮部劃歸泰領後之感想。（答）此次貴國政府同　將該等地區歸併泰領，使吾舉國民眾衷心感激，鄙人臨行之時，畢本首相特囑語　赴日本後，必須將泰國民眾歡欣之情形傳達於日本國民。泰國民對日軍於馬來樹立之豐功偉績，永表感戴，同時並已燃起恊力完遂此戰爭之決意。</p>

<h3>亞力山大　重赴西西里</h3>
<p>里斯本十七日中央社電　据阿爾及爾來訊，地中海反軸心軍副總司令亞力山大將軍，星期二日一度視察西西里美軍地區後，星期四日又至該島，在英軍地區，盤桓數小時之久，並訪問蒙甘茂萊將軍於其司令部，亞氏係乘英驅逐艦前往。</p>
<h3>西西里反軸心軍　遭受重大挫折　坦克國五十餘輛被擊毁　突破德陣地企圖已失敗</h3>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電　海通社軍事訪員塞托留斯上尉宣稱，軸心軍現正在西西里作堅强之抵抗，星期四日反軸心軍並無顯著進展反在許多地方遭受重大之挫折。喀太尼亞　南，英第八軍先鋒之坦克車隊，遭德軍之反攻，已退至向晋柯里至蘭　尼之一綫。蒙甘茂萊現正集中其新鋭坦克車部隊於奥格斯太附近，並抽調在萊蒂尼方面之步兵，故英軍頗有早日向喀太尼亞再度進攻之可能。眾料英軍或將以向西推進之中央部隊，改向北面進攻，俾使在萊蒂尼迪迤西，聲援向喀太尼亞突進之坦克車隊。英第八軍在賴格沙西北之左翼，前日略有進展，但並無戰略上之意義。英軍自吉拉向喀爾太基隆進攻，至前日午時爲止，仍未有絲毫進展。美第七軍左翼之加拿大部隊，在沿海向阿格里琴特進攻，略有進展，惟反軸心國方面所傳該地已受包圍之說，並非確訊該處北面美軍坦克軍所受損失極重，共被擊毀五十餘輛，英軍向喀太尼亞平原突進，亦損失坦克車五十輛，英美兩軍一日之間，損失坦克車百輛，雖不致過於影響　其戰鬥力，但英美在該島登陸之坦克車爲數不多，故亦足以牽制其行動云。</p>
<p>軸心援軍開抵西島</p>
<p>瑞典京城十七日中央社電　據前綫消息，軸心軍之增援部隊，經墨西拿海峽續抵西西里島。</p>
<p>西島戰事德方觀感</p>
<p>柏林十七日中央社電　據海通社訊，柏林政界方面，經數日之緘默後，現可暢論西西里戰爭在政治與軍事上之意義。德國報紙既未樂觀，亦不悲觀，僅就德義戰報所發表之事實加以評論，力陳義國堅決之態度與其內部之團結，義國報紙，對此亦一再有所聲明，此間政界方面稱，西西里之戰事，除軍事上之意義外，更需要推測其政治上之意義。羅斯福因下屆之總統選舉，邱吉爾因一般之局勢，兩人皆希望增强在內政上之地位，此外英美更受史太林要求，在歐洲作戰之壓力，不得不有所行動，羅邱兩人更希望粉碎歐洲政治之團結，以引起政治之革命，此間政界方面，就此動機，加以結論稱，西西里之戰爭，雖未發生於歐洲大陸，但英美無論進攻歐洲之何處，皆將遭遇軸心國與其友邦聯合之抵抗，因在此戰中軸心國與其友邦，已無彼此之分，德國認共同盟國之土地，不啻爲自己之領土，故義土之保衛，當共同出力，德國自始即駐軍於西西里之原因亦在斯，西西里不僅爲義國之屬島，抑且爲歐洲之前哨，保衛該島之防軍，雖未得要塞之利，然當予英美以堅强之抵抗。軸心軍之抵抗，足以牽製大量之敵軍，使羅斯福與邱吉爾在歐洲本土開闢第二戰綫之希望，無由實現，誠如蒙高茂萊將軍之言曰，西西里之佔領，僅爲成立第二戰綫之先決條件而已。</p>
<h3>季勞不日赴英倫</h3>
<p>里斯本十七日中央社電　倫敦消息云，據路透社外交訪員宣稱，北非法叛軍領袖季勞，大約不日即將由北美行抵倫敦。</p>
<h3>貝爾哥洛特區　德軍向北猛進　奧萊爾蘇解救攻勢失敗</h3>
<p>斯德哥爾摩十七日中央社電　據昨晚此間所接柏林消息，德軍自貝爾哥洛特向北猛進，現已向西擴展，此爲由貝爾哥洛特北面進攻德軍之戰績，雖天氣惡劣，而德軍之進展，並未稍受阻礙。彼等已與自固有陣地東進之衛鋒隊，在某山頂會合。新戰綫以南森林區域之蘇軍殘部，現正由德軍予經肅淸。奥勒爾以南之戰區，亦向東西兩麵繼續擴展，蘇軍在奥勒爾以南，繼續其解救攻勢，先以砲隊猛轟，再以步兵及坦克車隊，進攻德軍，防綫發生劇戰。蘇軍屢被擊退，損失坦克車甚多。德方某作戰區域內，擊毀蘇坦克車二百五十輛，多數係被德軍某師所擊毀。蘇軍損失雖重，而繼續在奥勒爾東南北三面進攻，但均被德軍步兵及鐵甲部隊所擊退，蘇軍在庫斯克以西發動之解救攻勢，並由大砲迫擊砲及坦克車掩護，此項進攻，顯示蘇軍畏懼包圍。據軍界人士指稱，蘇軍已損失坦克車約三·四〇〇輛云。</p>
<h3>西西里島戰况談</h3>
<p>自英美在義國的防衛第一綫西西里島開始登陸戰以來，歷時業已二日，在堅固的防衛陣綫前遭軸心里以逸待勞的邀擊，各地均遇阻遏而敗退。朝日新聞社於十二日午後八時用國際無綫電話向柏林分局探問西西里島戰事的詳情如下：</p>
<p>本社：西西里島擊退作戰的情况如何？</p>
<p>守山柏林支局長：敵登陸處所共有多處，最初均僅由德義的海岸防備隊擊退。至十一日，以　在島內待機的軸心軍主力軍主力部隊開始出動，據德軍事當局稱：英美人是陸上海上都能活動的兩棲動物，故而在登陸戰上頗占有利的立塲，最初或許能獲得暫時的成功。但能夠登陸的軍隊，決不能繼續長久。</p>
<p>本社：敵的降落傘部隊此後不會再　　？</p>
<p>守山：不會再來了。據德軍當局的發表，敵人最初使用降落傘部隊者，　爲瞭想在各地建立橋頭堡，但全部均經加以殲滅。此後敵方似將輸送後方部隊，因此，德空軍悠然取待機的　態，嚴加警備。</p>
<p>本社：義國的情勢如何？</p>
<p>守山：大　此次西西里的攻擊，從正面進攻軸心方面業已有充分準備的處所，其用意乃在減輕東綫紅軍的負担。但此對德軍全無影響，東部戰綫毫不因之牽動。所心據德軍當局看來，敵方開始西西里作戰的唯一目的的乃在地中海的自由航行。敵方對於運輸兵力，物資到東地中海顯然甚爲焦急。而且敵方開始西西里戰役由又帶有神經戰的作用。但蓋　氏（義大利日報主筆，墨索里尼首相喉舌）似曾說過：在義國，西西里不過是防衛義國水上的。第一一萬綫　第一綫被擊破，義本土亦不致感到任何威脅，而充滿着擊潰敵人的自信。所以敵方將遇到難以應付的對手。</p>
<p>本社：敵人的情况不明瞭嗎？</p>
<p>守山：詳細不得而知。据稱敵方亦已陷於非常的苦戰中。當上陸時，所使用的船隻共計稱有二千艘，當然這全部是微小的船隻。此後他們將和以前一樣，轟炸德國本國及其佔領地，可是歐洲要塞的防禦，早已如金湯之固了。（翔：　自七月十三日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>日訪華經濟使節團　今晨飛返東京　小倉團長發表考察感想</h3>

<p>小倉團長存華懋飯店向記者團發表聲明書，題爲「離中國之際」。略謂：余等此次訪問貴國之目的，已如七日抵滬時所述，實爲以中日交驩之民間經濟使節團之資格，在上　與南京中日方面民間級濟界人士及國府當局坦白懇談，冀蓋此機緣，在增加對日經濟協力上略有貢獻。余等自七月七日抵滬後，不僅在滬逗留六日，與中日經濟界人十懇談兩次，繼又在南京與各方面懇談逗留三日，共計十日，復得與國府當局率直交換意見，誠不勝引爲榮幸者。又余等能與各方面懇談，得以深悉中國經濟界之實性，及中國政府之財政經濟政策，以及中日經濟協力之方針等，實不勝欣幸。關於以上海爲中心之物價通貨，增强生產及食糧等問題，吾人在日本時，雖已稍知，然余等抵富地後，耳目所及，認爲事實上此問題實較吾人在日所　想像老更爲切實，且此問題之重且大，因此余等返日後深願根據此决考察所得，與各方面協商後，再向政府方面建議。吾人此次雖以民間經濟人之資格訪問貴國，然吾人認爲現在因處於大束亞戰爭中，且應採取中日兩國一體的戰時經濟態勢，故決不能推進如以往放任自由主義經濟，固不待言。總之戰爭經濟特質，必須以計劃經濟作爲基本，因此民間經濟，亦須依此方針而行。照如上所述，吾人現爲增强戰力計，深願謀官民一體盡全部智能，以努力於中日經濟之協力，惟日本方面有日本之特質，而同樣中國亦有其特質，吾等深感有活用其特質之必要。此次吾人已更進步認識中國經濟之特殊性，且深信活用中國經濟特殊性一事，最爲緊要，故當於謀强化中國經濟與中國經濟恊力提携之時，其具體方法，誠有對此點充分加以注要之必要：欲知對方之特質，若非實地接觸當地人士或風物，殊難瞭解，是以吾人擬爲更深悉中國之經濟起見，將來有機會必盡量來貴國考察同時尚祈貴國爲瞭解目下之日本起見，亦派經濟界有力人士來日視察。蓋吾人以爲須如此，始能使中日經濟協力得圓滿結果之故也。余等此次訪問貴國，頗承各方面款待，衷心感謝之至。</p>

<p>華北政務委員會委員長王克敏氏於十六日由京乘機來濾，料理私事，並將於今日（十八日）轉道返平。中央社記者特於昨（十七日）赴寓所趨　，叩詢華北糧倉問題，當蒙發表談話如次：關關於華北之糧食問題，以華北本非產米之區，其食米供應，全仰給於華中華南，雜糧則大抵運自東三省及外蒙各地，近受事變影響、致糧食呈缺乏狀態，目下北平小米價格的在一元五角左右一斤，而大米則以華北多以麥食，故不易購得。關於此事，汪主席亦備極關懷，經當局努力　　結果，已有一部份麥粉等運抵華北，尚有大部份糧食現正繼續設法運輸中，且今年華北麥子情形尚佳，當可　收，預料華北民食之恐慌，不久將來，或可消弭云。</p>

<h3>申報助學金　需款愈見迫切　依現存助金支配每生僅百元不敷尙鉅佇待社會慷慨襄助</h3>
<p>第五屆申報讀者助學金自一日分親辦理申請登記以來，將於二十日全部截止，在此期內、所收得各界捐輸助金，於數字言，較歷屆爲高，以支　言，較歷屆　細甚鉅，蓋學費之增加，申請人數之增加。足使現存助金七十餘萬，不足供申請者平均每人一百元之補助，雖捐款尚可源源獲各界之贊助，然依目前狀况，已使同人徬徨於助金預算之無從確立。</p>
<p>本屆助學特感需要</p>
<p>以本報歷屆辦理助學經過言，可謂向無預算，僅憑確信社會必有熱忱之人士。人類必具互助之同情，在每屆開始申請時，甚至存款無多，及登記開始，各界注視於助學金之進程，當較同　尤爲　心，不敷之數，歷屆均能於支付助金時，充裕應付。但本屆情形旣與以前逈然不同，一般貧寒家庭，經濟狀况已無法支持門戶，　論子弟讀書費，而往昔尚堪溫飽之家，亦已捉襟見肘，對於學費之支出，亦有難言之隱、因此之故本屆申請人數特多，而各校下學期學費之增加又非小數，此則同人於勉効棉薄之餘，深盼熱心人士於本報本屆助學金特予重視，慨然襄助，以竟事功，亦社會之幸也。</p>
<p>熱忱輸助實深欽佩</p>
<p>昨承唐星海先生慨捐助學金二萬元，唐君慷慨好施，對於社會公益事宜，向不後人，此次鑒於本報申請助學金人數增加頗鉅，需款浩繁，用　解囊匡襄，熱誠毅方。同人實深欽佩，願鼎甫先生哲嗣心逸誠齋賢昆仲，前爲本報助學運動，特捐學額，爲社會所共悉，此次爲紀念鼎甫先生、特再慨捐五千元、曁善公記興記各惠捐五千之數，爲淸寒子弟謀幸福，實堪欽敬，本報特代獲助諸生，致其謝意。</p>

<h3>華通盃慈善足球昨展幕　聯誼四比一大勝聖葡　邵以力開球夏士魁購義球</h3>
<p>華通體育會主辦之華通盃慈善足球賽，聯誼隊對抗聖葡聯軍。於昨日下午六時半在徐匯中學展幕，觀衆五六千人，情况熱烈。首由華通體育會會長蔣益門氏致詞，繼由財政部稅務查緝處處長邵以力主持開球。休息時間拍賣義球，競逐結果，由夏十魁以二萬元最商價成交。急公好義。時間旣屆，在裁判沈回春銀笛聲中，展開劇鬥，聖葡聯以維克暴，V蘇若，蓋恩缺席，實力不免稍受影響，故開賽之初，聯誼攻勢即盛。五分鐘時李義臣開角球，吳祺祥以手拍入，當然無效，費亦開角球，吳祺祥正欲拉射，因越位作廢，聖葡反攻，卡洛列區，勃拉達雙雙失機，迨十一分鐘時費春華在禁區射門，適中潘利拉手，被判十二碼，由孫錦順操刀，鐵腿起處，球應聲入網，十分鐘後，李義臣左路挺進，妙傳阿孫，孫正欲叩門，許而茲救駕心切，竟演倒戈趣劇。未及一分鐘，吳祺祥中路進犯，高保正竄上挑中網窩，上半時終了，聯誼以三比〇全勝。易門後，聯誼攻勢仍盛，吳祺祥率師來犯，輕傳小高，高略盤數步，從容打入，成四對〇。時離開賽未及一分鐘也，聖葡大舉來襲，勃拉達力射，不幸適中橫木。十五分鐘時，福恩單騎直人，在十餘碼處力叩，由門柱彈入，扳回一球，此後雙方各無所獲，迨時間屆到，聯誼以四比一克聖葡，第一一次定下星期三在原處舉行。昨雙方陣容如下：</p>

<p>昨日發報時間六點四十分</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>百物飛漲的後果</h3>
<p>百物飛漲的前因，我們已經一再加以說明了；其後果是怎樣？則不外四個字的答案，就是「民不聊生」。經濟學家李　時博士在其最近所發表的談話中說過二「友邦經濟使節來華之日，　號百物再度反動飛漲之時；諸使節於酬酢之餘，耳目所及固深知之；在民不聊生之現狀下，欲求經濟上軌道，何異於緣木求魚？」</p>
<p>「哀莫大於心死」爲中國自古的一句名言。民不聊生則心死，心死則任何一切勇氣都隨以消散，其足以削减國民支持戰爭的總力，是更不待言了。所以「現在各交戰國家，互相施行封鎖政策，其着眼點就在於使對方人民挨受飢餓，發生叛變』，以至於對敵屈服。最爲痛心的，便是「民不聊生之現狀」不是造自敵國的封鎖政策，而是造自本國的投機行爲。那眞不啻飲酖自殺了！</p>
<p>所以我們竭誠主張對於造成百物飛漲的一切因素，尤其是官商的非法賺利行爲，予以澈底的肅淸，藉以挽回「處理物價失收」的危局。</p>
<h3>銀錢業之舊規　均將加以修改　俾切合現代之形勢</h3>
<p>本市銀錢兩業現行之業規，久未修訂，已多窒礙雖行，眞最顯著之條文，如銀行業業規及錢業業規之第四章本位幣，第五條云：「凡一切收解款項，遵照財政部二十四年十一月四日部令槪用法幣」，現已於三十一年六月二十一日起改用中儲劵，而第二章營業時間及例假日，亦大有變更，蓋銀行卞面，事變前原爲外灘之洋商銀行星期六下午休息，華商銀行則下午照常辦公，今各銀行均已與中央儲備銀行取同一趨向，故業規之第二章第二·三·兩條，亦全需修正，至於餞業方面之錢　準備庫，及錢業票據交換所成立以後，亦均未及加入業規，故銀行公會下决理事會中，　錢業公會新任理監事選出就任後，均將提出討論，加以修改，俾切合現代之形勢云。</p>
<h3>本市煤球供應　決無匱乏　漲價之說完全不確煤炭店係藉端暗抬</h3>
<p>本市機製煤球，最近市呈求過於供現象，若干煤球商店以派貨缺少爲藉口，拒絕門市發售，且有煤球即將漲價之謠言，茲據該業中人談稱：本月初有數家煤球廠修理機器，曾停止出貨數日，惟爲期甚短，不及一週，即行照常出貨。目下供過於求現象之形成，全係市民誤信流言爭購之故。按煤球爲市民日常不可少之燃料。當局早有充分準備。按照全市需求量而決定各廠之出產量，決無匱乏之虞。市民切勿作變相圃積之購買，致影響市面，至於漲價謠言。流傳已久，查當局配給各廠媒屑之價格，與煤球限價二者之問，早有合法利潤存在最近且聞煤屑價格反有酌予核减之可能，至於烟白煤本年七月至九月之限價，亦經當局規定，正式公佈實行，決不變更，故煤球漲價之說，全屬子虛。</p>
<p>惟有一般小煤炭店，藉口增加車力及老司務之送力，每擔售價，超出限價有四五元之巨、市民因需用無法，衹得任彼剝削　然家庭之開支，受其暗虧不淺，尚祈　局注意及之。</p>
<h3>外紗織成品統稅　從價徵收百分之五紗布存庫六十餘萬</h3>
<p>茲據江海關爲自外國輸入之棉紗，直接織成品，應徵統稅布告第一六九八號。案查棉紗統稅改爲從價徵收百分之五一事，業於本年一月十六日第一六人四號布告在案，現自即日起，凡由外國輸入之棉紗，直接織成品，除徵收進口稅外，應照從價徵統稅百分之五，仰各商人等一體周知，特此布告。</p>
<p>又據消息靈通者估計，本市目下存在倉庫中之紗布統數達六十萬件以上，此項存積之紗布，以之供給本市零售，尚可供三年之用，現正由物資調查委員會派員調查云。</p>
<h3>小麥搬運派司　已領出六七十萬包</h3>
<p>華中各地區小麥，自經粉麥專業委員督促中日糧商收買以來，茲聞已告一段落，關於搬運派司。除第一批二十萬包業經領出外，第二第三批亦已相繼領出，總數共有六七十萬包，刻正絡　運申、大致抵埠上　者，約有數萬包之　，各製粉庭已從事整頓內部，一俟到有相當成數，即將準備開工云。</p>
<h3>雜糧公定價格　正在研討中　豆類到貨不斷</h3>
<p>本市雜椅市塲，近因價格高漲，而告停閉，惟雜糧之流通，關係民生至鉅，若任其暗盤縱　，亦非良策，茲聞該業負責人　，刻正槪呈　主管　當局，予以設立公定價格，俾便流通圓滑，而利民生、至於公定價格，現正在研討中。</p>
<p>今晨豆類略有來源、但銷塲寥落，黃豆價又」漲，浦東杜豆離大關已不甚遠。</p>
<h3>固本皂將　限價配給　每連定價三十元</h3>
<p>皂燭業同業聯合會，以肥皂爲日用品之一，刻下黑市高漲，而各廠亦因原料缺乏、出貨稀少，致民衆購置爲難。該會爰　將上海固本廠所出之固本皂，售價定爲每連中儲劵三十元，以配給市面需要，業已函請全國商業統制總　，核准照辦，大致日內即可開始發售</p>

<h3>華股趨勢</h3>
<p>昨華股始跌繼漲，終比　日升降不一，乃在大漲後不免少有餘風之遺留，握有者尚圖掙扎也，照大勢言，各股價已上升過高，苟無特殊刺激消息，恐有盤小之可能，週六成交極稀，乃一部份股票公司辦理交割停市，百貨業起伏最巨，永安公司傾跌後終見軋平，大關重見囘出，新新略見盤上，國貨內衣均低落，景綸與景福兩衫襪升降殊微，紡織業永安紡織，信和紗廠俱稍軋低，榮豐紡織穩堅，小票面向極極堅定，多爲小投資者吸納，如大中華織造，國信染織，均望高峰挺進，新藥業之中法小挫，新亞昻近關邊，文化業商務中華高峰再見，世界盤小，南洋烟公司及大中華火柴終見軋平，閘北水電華商電氣則稍軋升，康元製罐益呈挺拔，久安與大中華實業堅挺，新益地產已見同下云。</p>

<h3>The Rights and Wrongs of Politics and the Expression of Public Opinion</h3>
<p>— Chen Fumu</p>
<p>In recent years, government authorities have seemed reluctant to accept public criticism of politics, so we often hear the phrase "politics knows no right or wrong." They believe that since politics has no right or wrong, they can do as they please, regardless of whether people criticize them. But don't misunderstand, the phrase "politics knows no right or wrong" is not a universal principle applicable in all situations. It is absolutely not applicable to ordinary political measures.</p>
<p>It is only applicable in situations of dramatic historical change. In those situations, all old systems are being eliminated, and all social values are being re-evaluated. In such situations of negating everything and creating everything, politics naturally has no right or wrong. But such situations are rare. In the last two centuries, the only ones that qualify are the French Revolution of 1789 and the Russian Revolution of 1917.</p>
<p>Apart from the revolutionary situations of historical upheaval, politics is not without right and wrong. Practical politics focuses on facts and efficiency. Therefore, the correctness of a policy can be determined by the results after its implementation, and also by its impact on society during its implementation. Although it may be difficult to predict the results, the public's reaction is not difficult to gauge. Therefore, the judgment of right and wrong, if sought from the direction of public sentiment, can be considered half-successful. In simple terms, taking the direction of public sentiment as a guide is the formula for politics.</p>
<p>Politics is always inseparable from the people, and the main purpose of politics is always to seek the welfare of the people. For this reason, those in power should always pay attention to the immediate interests of the people, and they should listen to the people's political opinions. Otherwise, on what basis can politics be improved? Otherwise, politics will become detached from the people, and the people will become detached from the government. In this way, how can the people and the government become one? And from where can the government obtain genuine power? I recall that in the years of the Republic, 14 and 15, when the National Government was still in Guangzhou and had not yet launched the Northern Expedition, the people of Guangzhou could openly criticize the government in newspapers at any time. As long as the criticism was correct, the government would propose improvements at the Central Political Conference based on public opinion. At that time, the government followed the people, and did not believe that accepting public criticism and reforming government facilities would "undermine the government's prestige." For this reason, the people at that time were indeed one with the government, and the government did indeed receive the enthusiastic support of the people. Relying on this foundation, it was no accident that the National Government was able to promote the National Revolution from a corner of Guangdong in an environment of extreme difficulty. Unfortunately, this vibrant era was only a flash in the pan! Later, although military success was achieved, politics became increasingly dark, and a system of censorship was adopted to tighten the control of people's speech.</p>
<p>I personally hold a skeptical attitude towards the recent news censorship system. I believe that the proper function of news censorship should only be (1) to prevent speech that maliciously opposes the fundamental policies of the government; (2) to prevent the leakage of military secrets; and (3) to prevent the incitement of social unrest through unfounded rumors. Apart from these, social figures should be given considerable freedom of speech. For example, "Sino-Japanese peace" is the fundamental policy of the government and cannot be opposed, but this does not mean that the theories advocating Sino-Japanese peace must be identical in every formulaic article. Under the major premise of Sino-Japanese peace, people should be allowed to express all kinds of different opinions to their hearts' content. Because the more a problem is discussed, the closer it gets to reality. In political affairs, "a blind man riding a blind horse, approaching a deep pool in the middle of the night" is dangerous enough, and it is even more dangerous to plug one's ears and pretend to be deaf, not listening to the warnings of others. Therefore, even the autocratic emperors of ancient times, although they ruled the world as their family's, still kept several upright and outspoken officials by their side, constantly pointing out their flaws, offering loyal advice, and guiding the ruler to implement benevolent governance. We see in history that the more outspoken officials there are in each dynasty, the more enlightened the politics, and the more prosperous the country. In modern countries, there are parliaments, and public opinion can sometimes be conveyed to the government through parliament. Now China does not yet have a parliament, nor does it have old masters or censors. If even newspapers are limited to only writing formulaic essays and eulogies of virtue, where are the government's eyes and ears? Is there still hope for political improvement?</p>
<p>I believe that the time to change this consistent style should be now. Since January 9th, the government's tasks have become heavier. Since January 9th, the government has entered a stage of life and death with the Allied nations. What exactly does the government rely on to live and die with the Allied nations? Of course, it relies on the power of the people. Since the people are required to put forth their strength to live and die together, at the very least, the spirit of the National Government in Guangzhou in the years of the Republic 14 and 15, when it was one with the people, must be encouraged again. At the very least, the clear atmosphere of that era must be restored. At the very least, people must be allowed to speak truthfully about politics as they did in the past. Only by allowing the people to speak can there be clear public opinion in society, can officials be supervised by society, can politics be enlightened, and can the people be willing to actively cooperate with the government. Only by obtaining the active cooperation of the people can the government have genuine power. But the only condition for obtaining the active cooperation of the people is to allow the people to speak on politics—to allow the people to make truthful criticisms of politics.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I also believe that the government's current policy on mass movements should be changed. Mass movements, as the name implies, should be initiated by the masses themselves. But the current mass movements are "government-run," which need not be concealed. I believe that the change that should be made at the present time, at the very least, should be to "government-supervised, privately-run," on the one hand publicizing the government's policies, and on the other hand representing the interests of the masses, standing on the side of the masses, and representing the interests of the masses. If it is impossible to represent the masses in speaking, then mass movements fundamentally lose their meaning. And those who are engaged in mass movements have simply become tools for the government to raise and fool the masses. If public opinion cannot reach the top, then politics will become increasingly dark. If politics is dark, then the masses will become increasingly alienated, and politics will become even darker, going to extremes, and riots will follow.</p>
<p>Recently, I have frequently heard the slogan "National Revolution sets out again." If it is "the way things are now," the masses will definitely not be as enthusiastic as they were the last time they set out. I will not hide the fact that the masses need not be mentioned, even the intellectual class is now indifferent. Therefore, some people have recently been blaming the intellectual class for not being willing to come out and cooperate. I believe that this blame is too harsh. "The way things are now," what methods do intellectuals have and what opportunities do they have to cooperate? The cooperation of intellectuals is to use their thoughts and opinions to lead the masses to cooperate. Now that there is not even an opportunity to express thoughts and opinions, what cooperation can be said to exist? If the current style is not changed, and intellectuals are to be asked to cooperate, then only those intellectuals who, as Xunzi said, "enter their ears and come out of their mouths, only four inches between the ear and the mouth," those with "four-inch learning" are qualified to come out and cooperate. Some time ago, Mr. Yoshida Toyu had an article on "The Fence-Sitting of the Chinese Intellectual Class." Why has the Chinese intellectual class become fence-sitters? I believe that the most precious mouth of the intellectual class is the best explanation, because it is useless in this era. In fact, it is already very good that the intellectual class is fence-sitting. If that intellectual does not have a considerable understanding of the Sino-Japanese problem, he will never put one foot on this side. As for how the other foot is, it depends on the degree of political enlightenment, and whether their mouths and brains can fulfill their due obligations.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to repeat: politics is not without right and wrong. What the common people think is right is right, and what they think is wrong is wrong. Good and evil, right and wrong, are determined by the direction of the common people.</p>

<h3>Finance Minister Zhou Talks to Japanese Reporters About Economic and Financial Measures; Decides to Be Cautious on the Issuance of Central Reserve Certificates; Implements Barter Trade Between Central China and North China</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) — A reporter from the Japanese Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun visited Zhou Fohai, Minister of Finance and Governor of the Central Reserve Bank of our country, and raised many questions concerning economic issues. Minister Zhou provided very detailed answers. The main points are recorded below: The biggest problem in China's wartime economy at present is the price issue. The most important solution is to increase production. Hoarding materials will cause prices to rise. Therefore, the authorities have decided to crack down on hoarding, which should stabilize prices, and have organized a Materials Investigation Committee to investigate hoarding incidents and punish hoarders. Regarding the problem of increasing production, the main difficulties at present are the issues of raw materials and power. Among them, the lack of coal production, which is the source of power, is the biggest problem. In the future, we will actively try to transport coal in. Regarding the issue of raising raw materials, we are currently studying various countermeasures. Regarding the operating policies for enemy properties returned by the Japanese side in the future, because they are related to the issue of increasing production, we plan to adopt three basic policies to manage them carefully. These are (1) sale, (2) entrusted operation, and (3) lease. As for Chinese investment in merged companies, it has essentially become a total investment. However, when these companies are returned to the National Government for management, the authorities also welcome private investment and accept assistance from the general public and influential figures to prepare for it. The issue of smaller banks is related to prices. Therefore, we have revised the previous banking law. The policy is that if the original capital of each bank was 500,000 yuan, it is prohibited from operating now if it cannot be increased to 3 million yuan. Regarding the policy of absorbing public capital, we plan to restore the Shanghai Stock Exchange, which has been operating since the incident. Preparations are currently underway. As for the issue of setting a maximum issuance amount for Central Reserve Certificates, this was discussed when the Central Reserve Bank was established. However, because there are many difficulties in implementation, the maximum issuance amount for Central Reserve Certificates is not specified. However, this does not mean that Central Reserve Certificates will be issued arbitrarily. We will definitely be cautious about the issuance of Central Reserve Certificates. Regarding trade between Central China and North China, we will implement a barter system. The quantities have already been determined and are currently being implemented. As for the current financial situation of the National Government, it is very sound. There has never been a phenomenon of expenditure exceeding income. The issue of increasing taxes is also currently under consideration. The authorities' policy is to ensure that the increase in taxes does not affect prices. However, in terms of China's tax revenue, only the income tax belongs to direct taxes. Therefore, indirect taxes may be increased, but the tax increase will definitely not be too high. Regarding the current local financial problems, the main revenue is land tax, which will be rectified in the future to increase revenue. There is also business tax, but the performance is currently poor, so we are urging relevant parties to actively rectify it. In addition, we are currently not considering issuing public bonds.</p>

<h3>Korean Chinese Chamber of Commerce Donates National Defense Funds</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) — According to news from Busan, Korea, the Mokpo Chinese Chamber of Commerce raised 100 Japanese yen for national defense aircraft purchase funds. The Jeongeup Chinese Chamber of Commerce also raised 50 Japanese yen for national defense aircraft purchase funds. The funds have already been remitted directly to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and presented to the National Government.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Provincial Government Formulates Regulations on the Movement of Materials</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) — After the central government promulgated the Provisional Regulations for the Prohibition of Wartime Material Movement, this province abolished the Material Allocation Committee and established the Provincial Economic Bureau in May of this year, and formulated the Guangdong Province Provisional Regulations for the Prohibition of Wartime Material Movement, which were promulgated and implemented.</p>
<h3>Hu Zongnan and Others Confer on Military Sanctions Against Communist Troops</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) — From the perspective of foreign relations, the Chongqing side's demand to the CCP to disband the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Red Regime and the garrisoned CCP troops can show the retreat of Soviet power in China's northwest border region. From the perspective of domestic affairs, it is Jiang in Chongqing who intends to strengthen the dictatorship, and does not allow the CCP's current situation in the border region to be tolerated. Therefore, the Three People's Principles Youth League, the driving force behind the Chongqing side's unification movement, is launching a fierce struggle with the CCP in political, social, and cultural aspects. The conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party over the past six years has already entered the stage of military resolution. If the CCP's political compromise, such as the Yan'an side not liquidating its international nature, turning to national centralism, and changing its diplomatic, cultural, and economic policies that have never been based on communism, then the opposition and struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in various aspects will continue to occur. From a military perspective, if the "CCP Central Department" does not accommodate the "National Defense Supreme Committee's" military unification requirements, then the large troops of the "Chongqing Central Army" stationed in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region will cause other war zones to be in crisis, which cannot be tolerated. This kind of situation, where the Communist army shakes up the Chongqing army's rear and ignores the troop establishment stipulated by the Chongqing "National Defense Supreme Committee," arbitrarily increasing its strength to 500,000, and the result of the subsequent increase is estimated to be more than 1.2 million, but less than one-third of them are going to the front line to fight, and the rest are entrenched in the safe rear to cultivate strength. Hu Zongnan and other military and political cadres in northwestern Chongqing held a military meeting in Xi'an on the 10th of this month, and strongly advocated implementing thorough military sanctions against the "Eighteenth Group Army" to eliminate the root of the trouble.</p>
<h3>U.S. Air Force in Chongqing Faces Difficulties</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) — According to news from Chongqing, Colonel Hisset of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing revealed the unfavorable situation of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing when he met with a United Press reporter on the 14th. The main points of his conversation are recorded as follows: The composition of all the aircraft under the command of Brigadier General Chennault only recently reached a ratio of one bomber to three fighters. The current strength can only maintain a defensive posture, so we are more distressed than any other air squadron in the world. Due to the unstable climate in China, there are many dangers when navigating, and there are no complete flight maps, so its actions are rarely efficient. Also, because of the lack of personnel, these only flight officers have to run around all day long, and the hard work is really unimaginable to people in their home country. The most disappointing thing for us is that there are no bases on the east coast of China. As a result, no matter what sacrifices we make when bombing enemy planes, it will be ineffective and we cannot give the Japanese army a big blow. Therefore, if we do not secure bases on the east coast of China, our current efforts are meaningless. We also don't know why we are engaged in such dangerous work.</p>
<h3>Comprehensive Results of the Japanese Army in Hebei for Half a Year</h3>
<p>Shijiazhuang, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) — Since January of this year, the Japanese army has launched a annihilation battle against the Chongqing-Communist army in the entire territory of Hebei Province. By the end of June, the comprehensive results obtained are as follows: Enemy engaged troops, 242,879; number of engagements, 20,557; prisoners, 8,829; abandoned corpses, 1670; destroyed military facilities, 576; captured mortars, 88; other heavy machine guns, light machine guns, rifles, ammunition, etc. were numerous.</p>
<h3>Active in the Position of Rural Construction - A Visit to the Capital's Jiancun Agricultural College</h3>
<p>— Jing Yuan</p>
<p>Under the slogan of revitalizing the countryside and increasing food production, many people's eyes are focused on agriculture. Of course, today's Chinese countryside is backward and dilapidated. To make it shoulder the task of food supply in the system of total war participation, it is necessary to put in sincere effort and use all efforts in the work of rural construction.</p>
<p>Before the Incident, Zou Ping in Shandong, Ding County in Hebei, and Xu Gongqiao in Jiangsu all had agricultural construction experiments. After the war, the Chinese Youth Labor Corps replaced them in Nanjing.</p>
<p>The Chinese Youth Labor Corps has its main work divided into three parts: one is to train cadre talents engaged in rural construction, the second is to experiment with various systems of rural construction, and the third is to study various technologies for agricultural improvement. Jiancun Agricultural College is an institution engaged in the first type of work.</p>
<p>Jiancun Agricultural College is located in Embroidery Lane, Nanjing. The surrounding hundred acres of open space are the ruins of Li Xianggou's Garden. Now they have all been opened up by the college as a flower specimen area and a test area, so the flowers and trees are lush and the vegetables are full of gardens, which is quite pastoral. The college buildings are rebuilt from civilian houses, with more than 100 rooms. In addition to offices, classrooms, bedrooms, halls, dining rooms, etc., various laboratories, farm tool rooms, seed rooms, insect breeding rooms, agricultural product manufacturing rooms, warehouses, livestock houses, etc. occupy a large area. In terms of equipment, the college has spent more than 3.52 million yuan over the years, so it can be said to be quite complete.</p>
<p>In terms of organization, it is the same as the general agricultural college, divided into six departments: crops, horticulture, animal husbandry, forestry, agricultural education, and sericulture. Because of equipment, the three departments of crops, horticulture, and agricultural education are now set up first. There are a total of 120 students. This semester is preparing to recruit 50 new students.</p>
<p>What is special is the training method created by the college. The college advocates work-study education, and takes the classroom, laboratory, farm, and rural four-in-one as the slogan. Except for a very few abstract subjects, all subjects have more and better experimental time than class time. Students who only understand theory but do not know how to experiment cannot get a passing score in the subject. After 5:00 PM every day, all the students have to walk out of the classroom and go to the farm. Wearing farm clothes, with bare heads and feet, their dark skin and large palms can no longer see the appearance of college students. The nearly 100 acres of farm near the college, as well as the various routine work of the more than a dozen dairy cows, five or six dairy goats, more than 200 Angora rabbits, more than 30 pigs, and hundreds of chickens, geese, ducks, etc. in the attached pasture, are all borne by all the students. Reclamation, plowing, fertilization, sowing, intertillage, pest control, disease prevention, harvesting, grinding, pruning, feeding, grazing, mating, milking, disinfection, milk delivery, etc., each student takes turns to take on. At the same time, in addition to farm service, the operations in the college, such as cleaning, cooking, serving, writing, etc., are not done by others. Therefore, the college has fewer workers and staff than the average agency.</p>
<p>Whether familiarity with agricultural technology can guarantee that students will go to serve in the countryside in the future is still a problem. Because the college is located in the city, students have no contact with the real countryside, and the result is still alienation and cannot adapt. Therefore, the college specifically divides one semester in the entire training period, called rural life practice. Students are asked to live in the Xiaoxing Mountain Model Rural Experimental Area established by the Labor Corps, live and live with the farmers, and truly experience the actual situation of the countryside.</p>
<p>In addition, the college has another feature, which is that it does not have holidays all year round, but it does not have winter and summer vacations, not even a week. On the one hand, it is to match the habits of rural life, and on the other hand, it can also shorten the study period. The four-year university course can be studied in three years. In the sound of education reform, the college's experiment is worth noting.</p>
<p>Dean Chen Duanzhi used to be a social scientist, and he is also a hard-working person. He resigned from all official positions and devoted himself to this cause. Teacher Tie Ming, Head of the Crop Department Gu Fu, Head of the Horticulture Department Tang Mingxin, Professors Wang Linong, Shao Zhongxiang, Tong Yumin, Gu Boming, Liu Yubin, etc., are all authoritative scholars in the agricultural field, and the college has gathered them together, and the lineup is quite neat. Although it has only a short history of three years, the college has indeed laid an unshakeable foundation, and is worthy of being a major base for training rural work cadres, and is also a comet in today's rural construction journey!</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Compiles Two Draft Budgets That Are Flexible to Adapt to the War Situation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) — In order to adapt to the decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese government convened a regular cabinet meeting on the 15th to discuss two draft proposals: (1) the compilation of the Showa 19th degree budget, and (2) the general outline of budget control for important matters in Showa 19th degree. Minister of Finance Kaya and President of the Planning Board Suzuki each gave explanations and then made decisions, and based on this policy, created a must-win budget for the next year. This matter was explained in detail by the Japanese Information Bureau on the 16th. According to the budget policy for the next year, there will be significant changes compared with previous years. Regarding measures such as strengthening war capabilities, urgent enterprise preparation, and food production, a huge amount of temporary additional budget was previously allocated, and it now seems to have been put into practice. This is different from the past, which only focused on dealing with the long-term war. Therefore, a budget that is flexible to adapt to the war situation is made. Now, only the policy of compiling the budget for the 19th degree and the general outline of budget control for important matters are compared and reviewed with last year's. According to last year's cabinet meeting, the main focus was on increasing the population and revitalizing and reforming education in preparation for the long-term war, and matters for negotiation were predetermined. However, it has been revised in the 19th degree to strengthen the essential scientific and technological war capabilities, increase the production of special scarce materials, and thoroughly enhance the transportation capabilities of the sea, land, and air. This should be noted that in terms of funding, the main policy last year was to vigorously suppress the expansion of funding, while in the 19th degree, the amount of funding is not considered, only whether it can be used to achieve practical results. As for those deemed necessary to enhance war capabilities, they will be vigorously implemented. In addition, a huge amount of reserve funds will be added to prepare for emergency measures, and its proactiveness can be seen.</p>
<h3>Reduction in Tin Sales Prices by Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry has decided to reduce the selling price of tin and has instructed the Japan Metal Distribution Control Co., Ltd. (the national metal control agency) to implement the revised prices from today. The new prices are 430 yen for first-grade tin and 410 yen for second-grade tin per 100 kilograms, a reduction of approximately 48% compared to previous prices. The previous official prices were determined in November before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. At that time, based on the fact that 90% of domestic demand had to rely on Malaya, Medan, Bangka Island, and other places, the price of first-grade tin was set at 830 yen. Now that the southern tin-producing areas, which account for 67% of the world's tin production, are completely under Japanese military administration, the reduction in prices is inevitable.</p>
<h3>Numerous Germans Enlisting in the Navy</h3>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency naval reporter Hansen stated that for every vacancy in the German Navy, there are three or four volunteers eager to fill it. Therefore, the navy's recruitment department is always able to maintain its principle of selective recruitment. Volunteers are assigned to various departments according to their aspirations. The recruitment department now warmly welcomes young volunteers with technical training, as this type of talent is especially needed for the expanded activities of German submarines. Young military personnel from the German army and navy often apply to transfer to submarine service, which shows the enthusiasm of German youth for seafaring. Hansen also said that he had spoken with naval recruits in training, and among these 150 recruits, 17 had transferred from other military branches. They had already received general military training and, after a short period of special training, could be assigned to military stations for service.</p>
<h3>India Recruits National Army; Enthusiastic Response</h3>
<p>Shonan, 17th (Central News Agency) – Due to the overwhelming requests from Indian expatriates in Malaya to join the Indian National Army and volunteer to fight the enemy, the Shonan branch of the Indian Independence League, in order to accommodate this enthusiasm, began recruiting volunteers at the branch starting on the 16th. Upon hearing the news, Indians rushed to the branch to register. On the first day alone, more than 2,500 people registered. At 9:30 AM on the 17th, League President Subhas Chandra Bose personally visited the branch to thank the Indian youth who had enlisted and delivered an inspiring speech. Those who listened were deeply moved, and their determination to fight the enemy became even stronger.</p>
<h3>Brazilian Raw Materials</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) – Havas reports: Brazilian Air Minister Felinto stated to reporters in Washington yesterday that the military raw materials delivered by the United States to Brazil are extremely insufficient, so it is impossible to implement the work added to it by the United States.

<h3>Thai Prime Minister Broadcasts, Claiming Britain and the United States Are Engaged in Propaganda and Lack True Combat Strength, Cannot Be Compared to Germany</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 17th (Central News Agency) – On the 16th, Thai Prime Minister Phibun broadcasted from the Bangkok radio station a speech entitled "On Today's War," the main points of which are as follows: Radio stations in the UK, under British control, have recently been broadcasting news of the landing battle in Sicily, claiming that Britain has won a great victory, but the fact is that fighting is still continuing. My belief is the opposite, and I believe that the British army will repeat the defeat of Dunkirk. At the beginning of the war, Britain did not directly participate in the battle with soldiers, and France's fighting resulted in a disastrous defeat and nothing was gained. When France was working hard to strengthen itself, in order to maintain the balance of power, all kinds of pressure was applied to France, and after the war began, Britain remained motionless and did not send reinforcements to help France, watching success or failure. Even in the end, the force transported was less than 300,000. With this meager force, how could it compete with the German army, so it ultimately led to the disaster of Dunkirk. Now, looking at the East Asian side, at the beginning of the war, Britain believed that it could defend Hong Kong, Singapore, and the islands in the Pacific. The force it dispatched was less than 500,000, and the rest were Australian and Indian troops. Therefore, before half of the war was over, its forces were completely annihilated. Except for Australia and India, all British territories in East Asia were occupied by the Japanese army. After Britain was defeated in East Asia, it had nothing left, so it had to retreat to its island nation. In this war, Britain's position has not only completely lost its naval power, but also many small countries have left it. So far, the United States, the Chongqing government, and other small countries are still sacrificing themselves for Britain's ambitions. These countries, like France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Poland, and Greece, have fought for Britain and paid a heavy price. Britain often fights with very little strength. Britain has no spare strength for fighting other than the British Isles. Because Britain and the United States do not have the true strength to fight, they are engaged in propaganda warfare. The world is tired of hearing about the landing operations in Guadalcanal, Attu Island, and Sicily. The islands they boast about are not as important as Koh Phai Island at the mouth of the Mae Nam River. The difference between the war methods of Britain and the United States and the war methods of the Axis powers is that they are only for propaganda, while the Axis powers do the opposite, only seriously engage in combat and do not engage in propaganda. When the Axis powers occupied Paris and Singapore, they did not carry out any major propaganda, while they constantly propagandize "victory, victory," but where have they actually occupied? Only a solitary island in the Pacific Ocean with no strategic value. However, their propaganda makes it seem like it is some earth-shattering event. Britain and the United States are currently trying to achieve victory in specific locations. For example, according to British reports, they are using more than 2,000 ships to try to occupy a small island like Sicily, and even for this small operation, they have been preparing for more than two years. Even they themselves doubt whether that island has such value. Since they are fighting for propaganda, we cannot help but doubt their dream of victory.</p>
<h3>Thai Propaganda Director Invited to Visit Japan; Speaks to Journalist Group, Believes Thailand Must Closely Cooperate with Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) – Thai Propaganda Director Bai Raktham and Thai News Association President Phri Ka have recently been invited by the President of the Japanese Heavenly Feather Information Agency to come to Japan to observe Japan's propaganda organization under the decisive battle. They arrived here the other day, and yesterday (16th) at 4:00 PM, they met with a group of reporters at the Imperial Hotel here. The questions and answers with the reporters are as follows. The following is the answer by Propaganda Director Raktham: (Question) Please briefly describe the outline of Thailand's propaganda organization. (Answer) Thailand's propaganda bureau is roughly the same as your country's. Propaganda agencies must be closely linked to jointly plan propaganda operations. The current structure of Thailand's propaganda bureau is divided into six sections: secretariat, news, broadcasting, technology, enlightenment propaganda, and foreign affairs. However, the situation regarding Thailand's enlightenment propaganda has not yet reached a perfect stage. (Question) Please briefly describe Thailand's policies for completing the Greater East Asia War. (Answer) There are two main points to the policy of completing the Greater East Asia War: one is to maintain close cooperation with Japan, and the other is to guide the Thai people to adapt to the current situation. Also, News Association President Phri Ka's Q&amp;A with reporters: (Question) How is the Thai News Association organized? (Answer) The Thai News Association, or the News Reporters Association, is more appropriate to call it, as it is a group that strives to assist the government in implementing its policies. (Question) Please briefly describe your impressions after the four states of Malaya and the headquarters were划归划归泰领泰领. (Answer) This time, your country's government transferred these areas to Thai territory, which made our entire country deeply grateful. When I was about to leave, Prime Minister Phibun especially instructed me to convey the joy of the Thai people to the Japanese people after I went to Japan. The Thai people will always express their gratitude for the great achievements made by the Japanese army in Malaya, and at the same time, they have ignited the determination to cooperate and complete this war.</p>

<h3>Alexander Returns to Sicily</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Algiers, General Alexander, Deputy Commander of the Anti-Axis Forces in the Mediterranean, visited the American military area in Sicily on Tuesday. On Thursday, he went to the island again, lingered in the British military area for several hours, and visited General Montgomery at his headquarters. Alexander traveled by British destroyer.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Forces in Sicily Suffer Major Setbacks; Over Fifty Tanks Destroyed; Attempt to Break Through German Lines Fails</h3>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) – Havas military correspondent Captain Setorius declared that the Axis forces are currently putting up strong resistance in Sicily. On Thursday, the anti-Axis forces made no significant progress and suffered major setbacks in many places. South of Catania, the tank fleet of the vanguard of the British Eighth Army was counterattacked by the German army and has retreated to the line from Gincori to Leni. Montgomery is currently concentrating his elite tank units near Augusta and withdrawing infantry from the Lentini area, so the British army may launch another attack on Catania soon. It is expected that the British army will change the central force advancing westward to an attack to the north, so as to support the tank force advancing towards Catania from west of Lentini. The left wing of the British Eighth Army northwest of Ragusa made some progress the day before, but it has no strategic significance. The British army's attack from Gela towards Caltagirone had made no progress by noon the day before. The Canadian troops on the left wing of the American Seventh Army made some progress along the coast towards Agrigento, but the claim by the anti-Axis powers that the area had been surrounded is not accurate. The American tank corps north of that place suffered extremely heavy losses, with a total of more than fifty tanks destroyed. The British army's advance into the Catania Plain also lost fifty tanks. Although the loss of one hundred tanks by the British and American armies in one day will not excessively affect their combat effectiveness, the number of tanks landed by the British and American armies on the island is small, so it is enough to restrain their actions.</p>
<p>Axis Reinforcements Arrive in Sicily</p>
<p>Stockholm, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to front-line news, Axis reinforcements continue to arrive in Sicily via the Strait of Messina.</p>
<p>German Perspective on the Situation in Sicily</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to Havas, after several days of silence, political circles in Berlin can now freely discuss the political and military significance of the war in Sicily. German newspapers are neither optimistic nor pessimistic, but only comment on the facts published in the German-Italian war reports, emphasizing Italy's firm attitude and its internal unity. Italian newspapers have also repeatedly stated this. Political circles here claim that in addition to its military significance, the war in Sicily also needs to be speculated on its political significance. Roosevelt, because of the upcoming presidential election, and Churchill, because of the general situation, both hope to enhance their position in domestic politics. In addition, Britain and the United States are under pressure from Stalin to fight in Europe and have to take action. Roosevelt and Churchill also hope to shatter the unity of European politics in order to trigger a political revolution. Political circles here concluded on this motive that although the war in Sicily did not occur on the European continent, Britain and the United States will encounter the joint resistance of the Axis powers and their allies no matter where they attack in Europe. Because in this war, there is no distinction between the Axis powers and their allies. Germany believes that the land of its common allies is no different from its own territory, so it will jointly contribute to the defense of Italian territory. The reason why Germany has stationed troops in Sicily from the beginning is also this. Sicily is not only an island belonging to Italy, but also the outpost of Europe. Although the defending forces on the island do not have the advantage of fortresses, they should give Britain and the United States strong resistance. The resistance of the Axis powers is enough to contain a large number of enemy troops, making Roosevelt and Churchill's hope of opening a second front in mainland Europe impossible to realize. As General Montgomery said, the occupation of Sicily is only a prerequisite for the establishment of a second front.</p>
<h3>Giraud to Go to England Soon</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) – London news says that according to Reuters diplomatic correspondent, the leader of the North African rebels, Giraud, will arrive in London from North America approximately soon.</p>
<h3>German Army Advances Northward in the Belgorod Region; Soviet Relief Offensive in Orel Fails</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to news from Berlin received here last night, the German army is advancing northwards from Belgorod and has now expanded westward. This is the result of the German army's attack north of Belgorod. Although the weather is bad, the German army's progress has not been hindered. They have joined up with the vanguard advancing east from their original positions on a certain mountaintop. The remnants of the Soviet army in the forest area south of the new front line are now being cleared by the German army. The war zone south of Orel is also continuing to expand on both the east and west sides. South of Orel, the Soviet army continues its relief offensive, first bombarding fiercely with artillery and then attacking the German army with infantry and tank units. Fierce fighting broke out on the defense lines. The Soviet army was repeatedly repulsed and lost many tanks. In a certain operational area on the German side, 250 Soviet tanks were destroyed, most of which were destroyed by a certain German division. Although the Soviet army suffered heavy losses, it continued to attack on the east, north, and south sides of Orel, but was repulsed by the German infantry and armored units. The relief offensive launched by the Soviet army west of Kursk was covered by artillery, mortars, and tanks. This attack shows that the Soviet army is afraid of being surrounded. According to military sources, the Soviet army has lost about 3,400 tanks.</p>
<h3>Talk about the War Situation in Sicily</h3>
<p>Since the British and American forces began their landing operation on Sicily Island, the first line of defense of Italy, two days have passed. In front of the solid defense line, the Axis forces ambushed them with ease, and they were blocked and retreated everywhere. The Asahi Shimbun used international wireless telephone to inquire the Berlin branch about the details of the Sicilian war at 8 pm on the 12th as follows:</p>
<p>Headquarters: What is the situation of the counterattack on Sicily Island?</p>
<p>Berlin Branch Manager Moriyama: There are many places where the enemy landed, and they were initially repelled only by the German and Italian coastal defense teams. On the 11th, the main force of the Axis forces waiting in the island began to move out. According to the German military authorities: British and Americans are amphibious animals that can move on land and sea, so they have a great advantage in landing operations, and they may initially achieve temporary success. But the troops that can land will never continue for long.</p>
<p>Headquarters: Will the enemy's paratroopers come again in the future?</p>
<p>Moriyama: They will not come again. According to the announcement of the German military authorities, the enemy initially used paratroopers in order to establish beachheads in various places, but all of them were annihilated. After that, the enemy seems to be transporting rear troops, so the German Air Force leisurely takes a wait-and-see attitude and strictly guards.</p>
<p>Headquarters: What is the situation in Italy?</p>
<p>Moriyama: Most of the attacks on Sicily this time attacked the places where the Axis powers had fully prepared from the front, and its purpose was to reduce the burden on the Red Army on the Eastern Front. But this has no impact on the German army at all, and the Eastern Front is not affected by it. According to the German military authorities, the only purpose of the enemy to start the Sicilian operation is for free navigation in the Mediterranean. The enemy is obviously very anxious about transporting troops and supplies to the Eastern Mediterranean. Moreover, the enemy's start of the Sicilian campaign also has the effect of a nerve war. But Gai (Italian newspaper editor, Mussolini's prime minister's mouthpiece) seemed to have said: In Italy, Sicily is only defending Italy's water. The first 10,000 lines. If the first line is broken, the Italian mainland will not feel any threat, and is full of confidence in defeating the enemy. So the enemy will encounter a difficult opponent.</p>
<p>Headquarters: Is the enemy's situation unclear?</p>
<p>Moriyama: Details are unknown. It is said that the enemy is already in a very bitter battle. When landing, a total of 2,000 ships were used, of course, these are all small ships. After that, they will bomb Germany and its occupied territories as before, but the defense of the European fortress has long been as solid as gold. (Sho: From the Western Asahi Shimbun on July 13)</p>

<h3>This Newspaper's Sponsored Charity Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting; Two-Day Exhibition Period Determined; To Repay the Kind Affection of All Circles, a 30% Discount on Marked Prices</h3>
<p>Since this newspaper sponsored the Charity Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting for Urgent Accounts in North China at the Xingya Building at No. 12 Bund, it has been enthusiastically supported by all circles, who have rushed to bid for purchases, which shows the deep concern for fellow citizens affected by the disaster. Considering that there have been storms and rain in a row, and also oppressive humidity, which has caused inconvenience to many visitors, the event, which was originally scheduled to close on the 18th of this month, has been extended for two days until the 20th of this month at the request of enthusiastic people from all walks of life, to allow those who have not yet had the opportunity to see it to do so. At the same time, in order to repay the kindness of the reporting circles, this association has decided to give a 30% discount on all the items on display according to the marked price. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will uphold the purpose of sympathy and mutual assistance, go and participate enthusiastically, and create blessings for the disaster victims.</p>
<p>According to another report, although there was a strong wind all day yesterday, those who went to visit and purchase were even more crowded. Among them, the Daqing Silk Shop colleagues donated 14 pieces of precious clothing materials such as real silk robe materials and new tweed, which were purchased by the film stars Wang Yin and Yuan Meiyun for the highest price. Other famous calligraphy and painting works were also purchased a lot. In total, more than 60,000 yuan was received yesterday, breaking the highest record since the beginning of the event. I hope that all circles will continue to participate and complete the mission of disaster relief.</p>
<h3>Amidst the Unified Promotion of Charity, an Interview with the Poor and Sick Relief Association (4): How to Subsidize Various Charitable Organizations?</h3>
<p>After the second step of fundraising is completed, how will the subsidy work be carried out? The person in charge of the association said very cautiously regarding this question, in order to ensure that every dollar donated by donors in society is not wasted, and that every dollar achieves a certain effect, the subsidy of various charitable organizations must be approached with extreme caution. For charitable organizations applying for subsidies, we must first look at: (1) Is the purpose in line? (2) How are the results of the work? (3) What is the degree of urgent need for subsidies? Not just any charitable organization can apply to the association for subsidies. Generally, those with successful work, outstanding reputation, and genuine financial difficulties can submit an application to the association, detailing the type and nature of the work they do, the year and month it began, the actual situation of its progress, the reasons for the financial difficulties, the amount of subsidy requested, and attaching supporting documents and necessary attachments. After receiving the application, the association often has Secretary-General Xiang Kangyuan receive responsible representatives from the subsidization-requesting organizations, inquire in detail about their intentions, and explain the association's procedures for handling subsidy matters. The chairman of the association, based on the gist of the application and with reference to the Secretary-General's notes, approves or rejects each case separately. If approved, it will be submitted to the Standing Committee for approval. If it is approved, it will be submitted to the Review Committee (Chairman Wen Jie, Vice Chairmen Ji Zhen and Rong Boyun). After receiving the entire subsidy file, the Review Committee will review and approve or reject it in accordance with the Committee's procedures and detailed review standards. Approved cases must also be, depending on the nature of the applicant organization's work, sent to relevant members and accountants to conduct actual investigations, carefully examining the organization's history, person in charge, work results, financial situation, accounting books, etc., providing opinions and submitting a report to the association, before the Standing Committee decides on the method and actual amount of the subsidy. There are also extremely strict procedures for withdrawing subsidy funds. This extremely cautious approach can really reassure every donor, and also ensures that those who sincerely want to do good are not afraid of having nowhere to donate properly, and at the same time, it also provides practical assistance to those who sincerely carry out charitable work.

<h3>The Japanese Economic Mission to China Flew Back to Tokyo This Morning; Leader Ogura Published His Impressions of the Inspection</h3>
<p>Mr. Ogura Masatsune, the leader of the Japanese economic mission to China, led his team and entourage of twelve people, came to China on the 7th of this month. In Shanghai, they held cordial talks with people from the Chinese and Japanese financial circles, government officials, and the All-China Federation of Commerce, Industry, and Business Associations, and other business groups, regarding the issue of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. On the 12th, they went to Beijing to visit the Chairman and other relevant departments and economic figures of the National Government, holding cordial talks on Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and exchanging opinions, completing the expected goals. On the 15th, they returned to Shanghai from Beijing. On the 16th, they held a tea party at the Astor House Hotel, inviting relevant Chinese and Japanese government officials and people from the economic sector in Shanghai to express their gratitude. It is reported that the mission has completed its inspection task in China and will take a plane back to Tokyo this morning (the 18th). Yesterday (the 17th), in addition to bidding farewell to relevant Chinese and Japanese government agencies and economic circles, the mission also hosted a press conference at the Cathay Hotel at 2:00 pm to release their impressions of this economic mission to China.</p>
<p>Leader Ogura issued a statement to the press at the Cathay Hotel, entitled "On Leaving China". It briefly stated: As mentioned when we arrived in Shanghai on the 7th, the purpose of our visit to your country is really as a private economic mission of Sino-Japanese friendship, to have candid and cordial talks with people from the private economic sector and the National Government in Shanghai and Nanjing, hoping to create this opportunity to make a slight contribution to increasing economic cooperation with Japan. Since arriving in Shanghai on July 7th, we not only stayed in Shanghai for six days, holding cordial talks with people from the Chinese and Japanese economic sectors twice, but also stayed in Nanjing for three days, holding cordial talks with various parties, for a total of ten days. We are truly honored to have had the opportunity to frankly exchange views with the National Government authorities. Furthermore, we are very pleased to have been able to have cordial talks with various parties, allowing us to deeply understand the reality of the Chinese economic sector, the Chinese government's financial and economic policies, and the direction of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. Regarding issues such as prices and currency with Shanghai as the center, enhancing production, and food, although we knew a little about them when we were in Japan, but after we arrived, what we saw and heard made us realize that these problems are actually more real and serious than we imagined in Japan, and that the importance and scale of these problems are even greater. Therefore, after returning to Japan, we sincerely hope to consult with various parties based on the results of this inspection, and then make suggestions to the government. Although we visited your country as private economic people, we believe that since we are now in the midst of the Greater East Asia War, and should adopt an integrated Sino-Japanese wartime economic posture, it goes without saying that we cannot promote the laissez-faire economic system as in the past. In short, the nature of the war economy must be based on a planned economy, and therefore private economy must also follow this direction. As described above, we sincerely hope to seek the integrated efforts of government and people to exert all our intelligence to work hard for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation for the sake of enhancing combat effectiveness. However, Japan has its own characteristics, and China also has its own characteristics. We deeply feel the need to utilize these characteristics. This time, we have further recognized the uniqueness of the Chinese economy, and firmly believe that the utilization of Chinese economic characteristics is of utmost importance. Therefore, when planning to strengthen the Chinese economy and Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, it is essential to pay full attention to this point in the specific methods. If one does not have physical contact with local people or scenery, it is difficult to understand the other party's characteristics. Therefore, in order to further understand China's economy, we will definitely come to your country for inspection as much as possible in the future. At the same time, we also hope that your country will send influential figures from the economic sector to Japan for inspection in order to understand the current situation in Japan. We believe that only in this way can Sino-Japanese economic cooperation achieve satisfactory results. We are very grateful for the hospitality we received from all parties during our visit to your country.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Will Convene the Second Members' Meeting</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce will soon convene the second members' representative meeting after the reorganization. The date of the meeting can be determined within the next few days. After the promulgation of the "Provisional Regulations for Industry and Commerce Guilds," many industry guilds in this city have been reorganized. Therefore, it is necessary to re-register with the Chamber of Commerce. The city authorities are ordering each reorganized guild to re-register immediately, and at the same time, the guilds are also requiring member shops to complete registration within the deadline. As soon as this double registration is completed, it will be time for the Chamber of Commerce to convene the members' representative meeting.</p>
<h3>The Next Period of Household Rice Will Be Distributed by the Joint Venture Society</h3>
<p>According to sources, the rice for the 42nd period of household supply may be supplied and distributed to the various districts by the Rice and Grain Joint Venture Society, as in the past, for sale. As for the quantity, it is still to be determined, because in the past week, a large amount of rice has been transported to this port from various rice-producing areas. The quantity is difficult to calculate at one time, but the total is estimated to be around 100,000 bags. In terms of transshipment, there is a serious shortage of burlap bags inland. And water transport is also quite troublesome, so it can only be transported in batches. In short, the food problem in this city should not be panicked.</p>
<h3>The South District Pawnshop Will Be Established Soon</h3>
<p>The Municipal Economic Bureau, in order to alleviate the burden on the people due to the economic decline of the urban poor after the war, has planned to establish a municipal pawnshop. The plan has been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. It is reported that the South City area has already been surveyed by the bureau to find vacant houses on Fangbang Road, and once preparations are complete, it will be officially announced that the pawnshop will be established.</p>
<h3>The Food Panic in North China May Be Eliminated Soon; Mr. Wang Kemin Releases a Statement</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Kemin, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, arrived in this city from Beijing by plane on the 16th to attend to personal matters, and will return to Pingjin today (the 18th). The Central News Agency reporter went to his residence yesterday (the 17th) to inquire about the North China granary issue. He was pleased to release the following statement: Regarding the food problem in North China, since North China is not a rice-producing area, its rice supply depends entirely on Central and South China, while miscellaneous grains are mostly transported from the three northeastern provinces and various parts of Outer Mongolia. Due to the recent events, there is a state of food shortage. Currently, the price of millet in Peiping is around 1.5 yuan per catty, while rice is not easy to buy because people in North China mostly eat wheat. Chairman Wang is also extremely concerned about this matter. After the authorities' efforts, some wheat flour has been transported to North China, and a large portion of grain is still being transported. Moreover, the wheat situation in North China this year is good, and a good harvest is expected. It is predicted that the food panic in North China may be eliminated soon.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council Announced the Quantity of Fifth Period Household Sugar; White Sugar Half Catty 2.35 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating: From the 21st to the 31st of this month, household sugar will be sold by sugar retailers with sugar purchase certificate No. 5. At that time, the retailers with the registered number noted on the ticket will sell half a catty of white sugar (crystal white or granulated white) for each coupon, priced at 2.35 yuan. If packaging is required, a packaging fee will be charged separately. The sugar retail donation will be temporarily exempt from collection.</p>
<h3>Shen Bao Scholarship Fund Needs are Becoming Increasingly Urgent; Based on the Existing Scholarship Funds, Only 100 Yuan Per Student is Insufficient; We Await Generous Assistance from Society</h3>
<p>The fifth Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund has been accepting applications since the 1st, and will be fully closed on the 20th. During this period, the amount of scholarship funds donated by various sectors has been higher than in previous years in terms of numbers, but the expenditure has been much larger than in previous years. The increase in tuition fees and the increase in the number of applicants mean that the existing scholarship funds of over 700,000 yuan are not enough to provide an average subsidy of 100 yuan per applicant. Although donations can still be obtained from various sectors, the current situation has left our colleagues at a loss as to how to establish the scholarship fund budget.</p>
<p>This Year's Scholarship is Particularly Needed</p>
<p>Based on the Shen Bao's past experience in running scholarships, it can be said that there has never been a budget. We only rely on the firm belief that society will have enthusiastic people and that humanity will have the compassion of mutual assistance. At the beginning of each application period, there is even not much savings. When registration begins, various sectors pay close attention to the progress of the scholarship fund, and are even more concerned than our colleagues. In previous years, the shortfall could be fully met when paying the scholarship funds. However, the situation this year is completely different from the past. The economic situation of ordinary poor families can no longer support their households, let alone the tuition fees for their children to study. Even families that were once well-off are now stretched thin, and have unspoken difficulties in paying for tuition. Therefore, the number of applicants this year is particularly large, and the increase in tuition fees for the next semester in various schools is also not small. Therefore, in addition to our colleagues' efforts, we sincerely hope that enthusiastic people will pay special attention to this year's scholarship fund of our newspaper and provide generous assistance to complete this task, which is also the good fortune of society.</p>
<p>We Deeply Admire the Enthusiasm and Assistance</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Tang Xinghai generously donated 20,000 yuan to the scholarship fund. Mr. Tang is generous and charitable, and has always been willing to help with social welfare matters. This time, in view of the large increase in the number of applicants for the newspaper's scholarship fund and the huge amount of funds needed, he generously donated to provide assistance, showing great enthusiasm. Our colleagues deeply admire him. We are grateful to Gu Xinyi and Gu Chengzhai, the virtuous brothers of the Dingfu family, who specially donated scholarships for our newspaper's scholarship campaign, as the society knows well. This time, in memory of Mr. Dingfu, they generously donated another 5,000 yuan, and Shan Gong Ji and Xing Ji also donated 5,000 yuan each, seeking happiness for poor students. We are truly admirable. This newspaper specially expresses its gratitude on behalf of the aided students.</p>
<p>Scholarship Funds Received Yesterday</p>

<p>Propaganda Guidelines</p>
<p>Celebration of the Recovery of the Concessions Shanghai City Store Window Competition Propaganda Guidelines: The recovery of the Shanghai concessions this time is of great significance for the completion of our country's independence and autonomy. The citizens of Shanghai should have a warm celebration. The stores, restaurants, teahouses, dance halls, etc. in this city must base on the following points, use the original goods, and participate in the window display competition. (1) Those who participate in the window competition, the central theme of their design and layout, must fully display the warm intention to celebrate the recovery of the concessions. (2) The existence of the concessions hinders the integrity of our country's territorial sovereignty, and is the most serious cause of China's long-term chaos and the slow completion of the national revolution. The window layout should fully expose the sins of the concessions, and reveal the ambitions and tricks of Anglo-American aggressors. (3) The recovery of the concessions is the object of our country's struggle over the years, and this time, with the cooperation of friendly countries through peaceful means, this century-old scourge has been eradicated once and for all, establishing a strong foundation for the completion of the national revolution. Those who participate in the window layout should grasp the sincere assistance of friendly countries, implying that we should also cooperate with sincerity in order to achieve the completion of the Greater East Asia War. (4) The Shanghai concessions were the base for Anglo-American aggression against our country, hiding dirt and filth, and all dark sins were deeply rooted. Under the influence of colonial customs over the years, if you want to fundamentally improve the economy, you still have to wait for future self-restraint and efforts. Those who participate in the window competition should encourage the cloth people to learn from the past and be vigilant in the future, and strengthen the work of self-cultivation and reconstruction. (5) Those who participate in the window competition should point out the meaninglessness of the anti-war in Chongqing, and the facts based on the results of the peace movement, in order to smash the false propaganda of the United States and Britain and Chongqing, strengthen the citizens' greater belief in the peace movement, and raise the citizens' spirit of struggle.</p>
<p>Additional Notes</p>
<p>1. Those who participate in the window competition should first identify the theme and choose one or several points in the guidelines when designing the layout, and make appropriate arrangements. The meaning expressed should be clear and not blurred. 2. The method of layout is the same as the general advertising window layout, and the materials used are also the same. 3. The window propaganda layout should be based on the principle of being spectacular, lively, eye-catching, and deeply meaningful. 4. The window propaganda layout should choose the best window in the best location to layout, and do not layout the window facing a remote location.</p>

<h3>The Huatong Cup Charity Football Tournament Opened Yesterday: The Friendship Team Won 4-1 Against the Holy Portuguese; Shao Yili Kicked Off and Xia Shikui Bought the Charity Ball</h3>
<p>The Huatong Cup charity football match, organized by the Huatong Sports Association, pitted the Friendship Team against the Holy Portuguese Allied Forces. It opened at Xuhui Middle School at 6:30 pm yesterday. There were five or six thousand spectators, and the atmosphere was lively. First, Mr. Jiang Yimen, president of the Huatong Sports Association, delivered a speech, followed by Shao Yili, director of the Tax Investigation Department of the Ministry of Finance, who presided over the kick-off. During the break, the charity ball was auctioned off. As a result, Xia Shikui won the bid with the highest price of 20,000 yuan. He was eager to help others. When the time came, the fierce battle began amid the sound of referee Shen Huichun's silver whistle. The Holy Portuguese Allied Forces lacked Victor, V. Suro, and Guaine, so their strength was inevitably affected slightly. Therefore, at the beginning of the game, the Friendship Team's offensive was strong. At five minutes, Li Yichen opened a corner kick, and Wu Qixiang slapped it in with his hand, of course to no effect. Fei also opened a corner kick, and Wu Qixiang was about to shoot, but it was invalidated due to offside. The Holy Portuguese counterattacked, but Carlos, Bredar, and others missed opportunities. At the eleventh minute, Fei Chunhua shot in the penalty area, but happened to hit Pan Lira's hand and was ruled a penalty. Sun Jinshun took the penalty, and the ball went into the net. Ten minutes later, Li Yichen advanced on the left and passed it to Asun. Sun was about to knock on the door, but Xu Erzi's eagerness to save the situation resulted in an own goal. In less than a minute, Wu Qixiang invaded the middle and Gao Baozheng moved up to pick the net, ending the first half with a 3-0 victory for the Friendship Team. After changing sides, the Friendship Team's offensive was still strong. Wu Qixiang led the team to attack, and passed it to Xiao Gao. Gao dribbled a few steps and calmly scored, making it 4-0. It was less than a minute after the start of the second half. The Holy Portuguese launched a large-scale attack, and Bredar tried to shoot, but unfortunately hit the crossbar. At the fifteenth minute, Fuen rode alone and directly hit it at a distance of more than ten yards, and bounced in from the post, pulling back a goal. After that, neither side gained anything, and when the time came, the Friendship Team defeated the Holy Portuguese 4-1. The first rematch is scheduled for next Wednesday at the same venue. The lineups of the two sides yesterday were as follows:</p>

<p>News released at 6:40 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>Economic Circles - Commentary</p>
<h3>The Consequences of Soaring Prices</h3>
<p>We have repeatedly explained the causes of soaring prices. What are the consequences? The answer can be summed up in four words: "The people cannot live." Economist Dr. Li Xishi said in his recent speech: "When the economic envoys of friendly nations come to China, it is also when prices rise again. These envoys, in their spare time, will surely deeply understand what they see and hear. In the current situation where the people cannot live, seeking to put the economy on the right track is like climbing a tree to catch fish!"</p>
<p>"Nothing is more grievous than a dead heart" is an ancient Chinese saying. If the people cannot live, their hearts die. If their hearts die, all courage dissipates, which undoubtedly reduces the nation's overall ability to support the war. Therefore, "all warring nations now implement blockade policies against each other, with the aim of starving the other side's people, causing rebellion," leading to surrender. What is most painful is that "the current situation where the people cannot live" is not caused by the enemy's blockade policy, but by domestic speculative behavior. That is simply drinking poison to commit suicide!</p>
<p>Therefore, we sincerely advocate for the thorough elimination of all factors that cause soaring prices, especially the illegal profiteering behavior of officials and merchants, in order to reverse the dangerous situation of "failing to manage prices."</p>
<h3>The Old Rules of the Silver and Money Industry Will Be Revised to Suit Modern Circumstances</h3>
<p>The current industry rules of the silver and money industries in this city have not been revised for a long time, and many are already hindering operations. The most obvious articles, such as Chapter 4 on the standard currency of the banking industry rules and the money industry rules, Article 5, which states: "All receipts and disbursements shall comply with the Ministry of Finance's decree of November 4, 1935, and shall use legal currency," have now been changed to use Central Reserve Certificates since June 21, 1942. Chapter 2 on business hours and holidays has also undergone major changes. Before the incident, foreign banks on the Bund originally rested on Saturday afternoons, while Chinese banks remained open. Now, all banks have adopted the same approach as the Central Reserve Bank. Therefore, Articles 2 and 3 of Chapter 2 of the industry rules also need to be revised. As for the money preparation treasury and the establishment of the money industry bill exchange, they have not been included in the industry rules. Therefore, the Banking Association has decided that after the new directors and supervisors of the Money Industry Association are elected and take office, they will submit these issues for discussion and revision to suit modern circumstances.</p>
<h3>The City's Coal Ball Supply Will Not Be Scarce - Rumors of Price Increases Are Completely Untrue - Coal Shops Are Taking the Opportunity to Secretly Raise Prices</h3>
<p>Recently, the supply of machine-made coal balls in this city has been less than the demand. Some coal ball shops have used the excuse of insufficient distribution to refuse over-the-counter sales, and there are rumors that coal balls will soon increase in price. According to people in the industry, several coal ball factories repaired their machines at the beginning of this month, which stopped shipments for a few days, but it was very short, less than a week, and shipments resumed as usual. The current situation of supply exceeding demand is entirely due to citizens mistakenly believing rumors and rushing to buy. Coal balls are an indispensable fuel for citizens' daily life. The authorities have made full preparations. The output of each factory is determined according to the city's demand, so there is no worry about scarcity. Citizens should not make disguised hoarding purchases, which will affect the market. As for the rumors of price increases, they have been circulating for a long time. An investigation reveals that there is a legal profit margin between the price of coal dust allocated to each factory by the authorities and the price limit of coal balls. Recently, it was even heard that the price of coal dust may be appropriately reduced. The price limit for smoke-free coal from July to September of this year has also been officially announced and implemented by the authorities and will not change. Therefore, the rumors of coal ball price increases are completely unfounded.</p>
<p>However, some small coal shops use the excuse of increasing vehicle costs and the labor of old workers to sell each dan (unit of weight) for 4 or 5 yuan above the price limit. Because citizens need them, they have no choice but to let them exploit them. However, the expenses of families suffer a lot, and it is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Unified Tax on Finished Foreign Yarn Products - 5% Ad Valorem - More Than 600,000 Rolls of Yarn in Stock</h3>
<p>According to the Jianghai Customs Notice No. 1698 regarding the unified tax to be levied on cotton yarn imported from abroad and directly woven into finished products: The matter of changing the unified tax on cotton yarn to 5% ad valorem was already announced in Notice No. 1694 on January 16 of this year. From now on, all cotton yarn imported from abroad and directly woven into finished products, in addition to import duties, shall be subject to a unified tax of 5% ad valorem. All merchants are hereby informed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to informed sources, it is estimated that the total number of yarn and cloth currently stored in warehouses in this city is over 600,000 pieces. This stock of yarn and cloth, if used to supply retail in this city, can last for three years. The Materials Investigation Committee is currently sending personnel to investigate.</p>
<h3>Wheat Transport Permits - 600,000 to 700,000 Bags Already Issued</h3>
<p>Since the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee urged Chinese and Japanese grain merchants to purchase wheat from various regions in Central China, it has been heard that it has come to an end. Regarding transport permits, in addition to the first batch of 200,000 bags that have already been issued, the second and third batches have also been issued one after another, totaling 600,000 to 700,000 bags. They are currently being transported to Shanghai in succession. Approximately tens of thousands of bags have arrived. Flour mills have begun to rectify their internal affairs and will prepare to start work as soon as a considerable amount arrives.</p>
<h3>Official Price of Miscellaneous Grains - Under Discussion - Continuous Arrival of Beans</h3>
<p>The miscellaneous grains market in this city recently closed due to high prices. However, the circulation of miscellaneous grains is crucial to the people's livelihood. Allowing them to be traded secretly is not a good policy. It has been heard that the person in charge of the industry is currently submitting a report to the relevant authorities, requesting the establishment of an official price to facilitate smooth circulation and benefit the people's livelihood. The official price is currently under discussion.</p>
<p>This morning, there was a slight source of beans, but sales were sparse. The price of soybeans has risen again, and Pudong soybeans are not far from breaking through the customs.</p>
<h3>Gu Ben Soap Will Be Subject to Price Limits and Rationing - Price Set at 30 Yuan Per Bar</h3>
<p>The Soap and Candle Industry Association believes that soap is one of the daily necessities. The black market price is currently high, and factories are also producing little due to a lack of raw materials, making it difficult for the public to purchase. The association has therefore decided to set the selling price of Gu Ben soap produced by the Shanghai Gu Ben Factory at 30 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates per bar, in order to ration it to the market. It has already sent a letter to the National Commercial Control Board for approval, and it is expected to begin sales within a few days.</p>

<h3>Increased Production Movement Takes Effect - Ramie Production Increases</h3>
<p>Due to the increased production movement, the output of ramie in Central China this year has greatly increased compared to previous years. It is currently being actively purchased by Chinese and Japanese Tibetan merchants. The total amount to be purchased this year is approximately 300,000 dan, but the price is approximately eight times higher than the previous year.</p>
<h3>Trend of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks initially fell and then rose, and in the end there were mixed ups and downs compared to the previous day. This was inevitable after a big rise, and there were still some remaining winds. Those holding stocks were still trying to struggle. In general, the prices of various stocks have risen too high. If there are no special stimulating news, there may be a small consolidation. Transactions on Saturday were extremely rare, as some stock companies were closing the market to handle settlements. Department stores fluctuated the most. Yong'an Company saw equalization after a sharp decline. Daguan was seen to return. New World saw a slight increase. Guohuo Underwear both fell. Jinglun and Jingfu's socks saw very small rises and falls. In the textile industry, Yong'an Textile and Xinhe Yarn Mill both declined slightly. Rongfeng Textile was firm. Small stocks were extremely firm, and many were absorbed by small investors. Da Zhonghua Weaving and Guoxin Dyeing and Weaving both looked forward to reaching new peaks. Among new medicine companies, Zhongfa declined slightly, and Xinya approached the customs. In the cultural industry, Shanghai Commerce and China reached new peaks. The world was consolidating. Nanyang Tobacco Company and Da Zhonghua Match finally saw equalization. Zhabei Water and Electricity and China Electric Power both rose slightly. Kangyuan Canning was increasingly strong. Jiuan and Da Zhonghua Industrial were firm. Xinyi Real Estate has already been seen to fall.</p>
<h3>Various Associations Establish Investigation Groups to Prevent Malpractice</h3>
<p>After the various trade associations in this city issued notices to prevent the smuggling and hoarding of materials, reporters learned that in addition to establishing material allocation groups, they will also set up "investigation groups" to investigate the out-of-bounds actions of fellow traders. However, this organization only has the power to investigate the truth and has no power to deal with it.</p>
<h3>Trade Associations Urge Members to Register Again - Late Registration Will Result in Forced Shutdown</h3>
<p>Most of the trade associations in this city have been reorganized in accordance with government orders. All members of the same trade should register for membership. The registration items include: (1) Business name, (2) Business type, (3) Capital amount, (4) Number of employees, (5) Establishment date, (6) Manager's name, and (7) Address. Each association must compile a list of members and submit it to the competent authority for filing by a certain date. The various associations have found that a small number of traders have delayed registration, making it impossible to compile the list. The associations have set a deadline for unregistered traders to complete the registration procedures immediately. Those who still fail to register after the deadline will not only lack membership qualifications but will also be ordered to close down.</p>
<h3>Activities of Various Trade Associations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Coarse and Fine Pigment and Sundries Trade Association previously had disputes with the Western Pigment and Dyes Trade Association due to different natures and various relationships. They were unwilling to merge to form a trade association. The matter was forwarded to the Bureau of Commerce and Trade for handling by the Ministry of Industry. It has now been heard that the Ministry has replied approving the Western Pigment and Dyes Industry and the Coarse and Fine Pigment and Sundries Industry, which belong to the Chemical Industry Association, to separate and establish their own trade associations for identification.</p>
<p>The lower-level organization of the Oil and Grain Professional Committee, the Oil and Grain Federation, is actively completing the organization in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions for the convenience of raw material collection. It is learned that the areas that have been completed include (Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, Nantong, Jiaxing, Wuhu), etc., and it is scheduled to be completed within a few days. The organization of the oil and grain industry in the Bengbu area will be reorganized by the Chinese and Japanese Miscellaneous Grain Industry Committee. The oil and grain industry organizations in Nanjing and Zhenjiang are still being planned.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Special Municipality Dim Sum Restaurant Industry Association has required all fellow traders operating dim sum restaurants to apply for membership in accordance with the law. However, a small number of traders are still taking a wait-and-see attitude and delaying membership. The association has repeatedly urged them to join quickly to avoid being shut down. To facilitate membership for fellow traders in the West Shanghai area, a West Shanghai office has been established at No. 23, Lane 126, Kainal Road. The membership registration matters have come to an end. In accordance with the Interim Measures for Grain Merchant Registration, it has been approved by the Grain Bureau to handle commercial registration on its behalf, and members have been notified to go to apply for processing by a certain date. Regarding the issue of raw material allocation required by fellow traders, in addition to the existing allocations, it is actively applying to the relevant authorities for various raw materials that have not yet been allocated.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Gold and Silver: This morning, the store price and handling fee of jewelry gold from Dashin and other silver stores in this city have not changed, but there is no goods on the market. Outside-the-trade transactions are in a standstill. There is no formal market price. Generally, prices fell first and then went in tandem, and finally hovered above the customs.

<p>Call Loan Interest: The call loan interest rate posted by the Money Industry Association remains unchanged at 24%.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth: Due to the strict crackdown by the Bureau of Commerce and Trade, there is no formal market price for opening. The trend continues to soften, and people's hearts are extremely tired.

White Cat printed cloth spot also fell slightly.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn: The market is still in a standstill. Because weekend transactions are still very thin, only 20-count Double Horse yarns are traded, and the price hovers above the fourth customs.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities: Due to the continuous entry of customers, the stock of matches is quite thin, so new high prices are repeatedly reached. The prices of various brands have broken rare new records. Yangzhu White Leishi brand suddenly rose sharply. Soap, such as Sunlight brand, has recently been widely used, and the price is also rising step by step. Other Gu Benxiang brands are still firmly standing at the peak.</p>
