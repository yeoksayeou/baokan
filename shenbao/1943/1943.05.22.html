<p>社評</p>
<h3>戰時生活的矛盾現象　工廠與舞塲之對照</h3>
<p>戰時生活，尤其在决戰階段的世界戰爭中的戰時生活，必須集中全國人民的一切力量、以貢獻於國家。所謂戰時生活的主要內容，一方面要求各階層的國民，儘可能忍耐不便與困苦，儘可能降低自己的生活享受，以期節約人力物資　，貢獻於國家，爭取戰爭的勝利。另一方面，就要求人民，把一切心力和勞力，　都集中在生產事業上，每一　分鍾的時間，每一毫厘的力量，都要求獲得相當的效果，以爲爭取戰爭勝利之助。國家實施總動員，以及各種統制的計劃，國民人人自勉，所謂「愛國奉公」，「總力參戰」，無非爲此。現代每一個軍事家，都堅决的說，目前戰爭的最後决定力量，不僅在前方的作戰，而且更依靠後方一切力量的集中於戰爭機構，即是國民戰時生活的澈底。那一個國家的國民戰時生活最澈底，那麽，這一個國家便可立於不敗的地位，而爭取决戰中的勝利。試問目前在戰爭中站在優勝地位的國家，那一國不是由於後方國民生活之嚴肅緊張，節約浪費，增强生產的？</p>
<p>自國府參戰以來，上海即爲戰時都市，每一個市民，都應有戰爭的責任與義務，每一個市民都應實踐戰時生活·可是，實際上我們所看到的完全不同，我們看不到甚麽戰時景色，看不到甚麽戰時精神，或許是完全相反。其中最明顯的例子：如跳舞，早間有晨舞，中午有午舞，午後有茶舞，晚間有夜舞，淸歌曼舞，常非至深夜不止，尚有終宵不輟，而晨舞又接「趾」而起·這種不浪費一分時間和精神，可謂至矣盡矣；如不是消耗浪費性質的跳舞而爲一種生產事業，那麽，我們相信，上海物資必不虞缺乏，物價必不愁波動，而國家參戰的效果也必更顯著了，可爲長嘆息者，不是生產而是跳舞，而是消耗物資，浪費精力，麻醉人心的跳舞！</p>
<p>相反的，我們來看生產事業的工廠吧，過去有日班，有夜班，在戰時各國更已廢除了上下午時制，而爲終日工作制，無分日夜，從事生產，雖一分一秒的時間，亦不讓敵方追上；而今日上海的工廠，除了極少數的例外，夜工早已停開，日工也時開時停，間日開工，三日開工，以至長期停頓的，所在皆有。這個絕對矛盾的戰時生活現象，我們將何以解釋？然而，這樣的矛盾現象，恐怕决不止於舞塲與工塲的對照而已！</p>
<p>我們特地舉出工廠與舞塲兩事，來作一對比，是說明目前一部分國民生活，不但毫無戰時生活的意味，簡直是背道而馳，比較平時生活更不合理。因爲在平時，已經需要講求增加生產，發展工業，所以平時的工廠，已經實行日夜班不停的制度。那末，到了戰時，更需要加强生產能率，論理應比平時更加多工作班次，至少至少也要維持平時的工作班次。然而目前的事實，　是特別减少工作班次。我們雖然也懂得電力的限制，以及原料的缺乏等等環境上的因素。可是，我們要問：在戰時國家的經濟原則上，究竟還是增加生產，還是减少生產？如果說增加生產是「天經地義」的，是戰時經濟政策綱領中明確規定的，那麽，爲什麽就不去想方法排除所謂環境上的因素呢？，工業界不乏目光遠大人士，</p>
<p>總而言之，我們始終認爲扶助生產事業，促使增加生產，是實踐戰時生活首要的一點。如果發現阻礙生產的因素，無論是困難重重，必須堅决排除。舉例言之，電力限制，就須交涉煤斤接濟；（這裏須注意的飲食娛樂塲所的電力消耗與工廠電力消耗的比較。）原料缺乏，其原因在農業生產者，就須提倡栽植，在運輸阻滯者，就須交涉疏通。（這裏又須注意工廠及其他囤戶是否囤積原料。）如果一面高喊如何增加生產，一面却熟視着阻礙生產的原因坐待其自然好轉，那是决不能實現的。我們竭誠盼望政府，嚴密注意阻礙生產的原因，調整不合戰時生活的矛盾現象。同時，經營生產事業的工廠，也應聯合起來，與政府取得密切聯繫，協力解决阻礙生產的原因。諺云：「事在人爲」工業界不乏目光遠大人士，無論爲發展本身事業着想，爲復興國家產業着想，爲增加生產，充裕戰時物資。安定民生，爭取戰爭勝利着想，均當主動奮起，建議政府，協同政府，以期達成增加生產的目的。</p>
<h3>日俄戰役　　三十八年前本報之記載　　舊報新抄（二）</h3>
<p>引言</p>
<p>我們認淸今後保衛太平洋，將全是亞洲人的責任，再不容許英美插足侵略勢力。不過，克盡保衛的任務，端賴强大的海軍力量。友邦日本建立海軍，歴數十年辛勤經營，不斷精進。在三十八年前的日俄戰役中，以寡克衆，初露頭角。此次大東亞戰爭中，更發揮了所向無敵的威力。而目前太平洋整個防務，由友邦海軍獨任艱鉅，我們未能稍爲分勞，殊深愧怍。因此，我們今後將如何以友邦海軍爲模範，建立中國新海軍，參加防衛太平洋的任務，實爲國人所應共同急起直追的努力目標。本報爲增進國人海軍知識與興趣，特將三十八年前日俄戰爭時本報記載，摘爲新抄，自廿　日至三十日止以十日爲期，尚祈讀者注意爲幸。</p>
<h3>日俄之戰關係亞洲大局說</h3>
<p>（載本報第一一〇八〇號光緒三十年正月初九日西暦一九〇四年二月廿四日禮拜三）</p>
<p>日俄兩國之爭戰，其盛衰興廢之關係乎？蓋自開闢以迄於今，綿歴數萬年，亞洲獨處東半球，大海環於東南，沙漠限於西北，閉關自守，從不與他洲相通。自歐人創輪舶輪車之製，渺滄海於一栗，視萬里若戶庭，於是五洲大通，特闢一千古未有之奇局。各國君若相知，國與國交涉旣繁，和平之局必不能常恃，戰爭之端必不能倖免也。爰爲立盟約以保全之，設公法以範圍之，俾不至化玉帛爲干戈，國與民皆受其蹂躪。無如交際旣稔，釁隙易生，小小爭端無論矣，屈指近百年來，歐美各國，如俄法之戰，法德之戰，英法之戰，南北美洲之戰，皆兵連禍結，時越數年，糜餉數千萬，傷人數萬萬，直待勝負之數的定，始各言歸於好，重尋壇坫之盟。然此皆事在歐美兩洲，於亞西亞尚無干涉。若用兵在亞洲境者，惟俄土之戰，差爲可觀，其餘如英法日本諸國之與中國交兵，甫相見以戎衣，即重敦夫和好。雖曰疆塲有事，曾不足與言戰爭。惟茲日俄兩國，俄雖僻處歐西，而自西卑利亞鐵路造成，已有席捲亞洲之勢，日雖亞東島國，而自戰勝中國後，繕甲兵，購船艦，長駕遠馭，亦有雄視亞洲之心。兩雄旣不並立，則戰禍之起，早在意計之中。此次果因中國東三省及高麗起釁，遽構兵端，一戰於　　，再戰於旅順。觀日本報章所紀，已捷音迭吿，俄則傷損甚多。然兵事消息，變幻無端，俄人竟敗衂而回，以俄皇之孟驇梟雄，豈肯以挫折偶逢，遽甘退讓。觀昨報所載，俄皇方且調集大兵五十萬，由鐵路馳赴遼東，不及一月，即可調劑，其堅忍不磨之概，殊足先聲奪人。若日本地勢，雖不及俄之深固，氣魄雖不及俄之沈雄，然君臣上下，萬衆一心，奮勇直前，毫無瞻顧，且智謀則異常靈巧。偵探則到處周詳，冒險出奇，是其長處，此後即或遭挫敗而再接再厲，銳氣斷不稍衰。當此兵釁初開，所謂鹿逐中原，究未知死於誰手。惟以淺見窺之，日俄勝敗之所分，即亞洲安危之傒，從前俄國艦隊欲出黑海口，爲各國所扼，改道向東。夫各國之所以不許其出黑海者，非特忌之，直畏之也。今旣伸勢力於亞東，倘他日奏凱而回，非特中國東三省盡入俄人掌握中，即高麗亦雖免隸入俄國版圖之內。日本至此，藩籬盡撤，海東孤島，殊屬可危。而中國之爲其扼背拊吭者，更無論矣。</p>

<p>東京二十一日中央社電　日海軍省二十一日下午四時公布古賀峯一大將任聯合艦隊司令長官後，橫須賀鎭守府司令長官一職，決由豐田副武大將補任。</p>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　日聯合艦隊司令長官古賀峯一大將，現年五十九歲，明治四十年十二月任少尉，大正六年十二月官至少佐，同年十二月畢業於海軍大學後，被派赴法國，歷任海軍大學敎官，日駐法大使館武官等職，昭和五年五月任海軍省副官，同年十二月任古葉艦艦長，昭和六年十二月轉任伊勢艦艦長，昭和七年十二月晋陞少將，昭和十一年十二月進級中將，補爲練習艦隊司令官，昭和千二年十二月任軍令部决長，昭和十四年十月轉任海上某要職，昭和十六年九月任中國方面艦隊司令官，樹立幾多功勳，昭和十七年五月進級大將，同年十一月就任橫須賀鎮守府司令長官以迄於今。</p>

<p>島田海相闡明決意</p>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　日海相島田氏，於二十一日下午五時將就山本聯合艦隊司令長官壯烈殉國事，發表談話，大意謂：「我海軍自夏威夷。馬來海面一戰，震驚世界以來，即在太平洋及印度洋之全域，實施大規模之作戰，於各處擊破頑抗，收獲光輝戰果，迄今已一年有半，而能奠定必勝之基礎者，固御稜威所賜，同時聯合艦隊與陸軍緊密協助，實行週密之作戰與艦隊統率應付得宜，充分發揮其實力所致。山本元帥之殊動實可傳之史册，永垂不朽。溯自大戰開始以來，山本元帥親臨前綫指揮作戰，收獲莫大戰果，今不幸於最前綫壯烈殉國，惡耗傳來，全國震驚而感涕，殺敵之志，亦益增强。今戰局愈趨重大，實爲決定我國興亡之秋，山本元帥之殉國，固爲莫大之憾恨，但我國海軍並未因此而發生些微之動搖，決在御稜威之下，以日盛之士氣，鞏固殺敵之決意，繼續奮鬥，以安聖慮。</p>
<p>林宣部長發表談話</p>

<p>任海長悼山本大將</p>
<p>南京二十一日中央社電　海軍部長任援道上將發表簡要談話如下：「自大東亞戰爭勃發以來，友邦海軍以決死之信念，造成偉大之戰果，實爲東亞民族之光榮。此次山本大將爲保衛東亞而戰死，吾人對之實表示無限之欽敬。山本大將已成爲東亞海軍之神，吾人旣敬仰其豐功偉績實應完成其未竟之宏願，以努力完遂戰爭。大將生前，本人會瞻仰多决，其偉大之豐采，至今尤深印在本人之腦海也。至繼任之古賀大將，在派遣中國海軍司令長官任內，對於本人更爲密切，大將爲具有戰略之天才家，此後之殲減英·美海軍，使太平洋海域成爲堅固之保壘，可以操券也。」</p>

<h3>「緬懷山本元帥」矢野部長廣播聲淚俱下</h3>
<p>東京廿一日中央社電　日聯合艦隊司令長官山本元帥壯烈殉國之消息傳來後，日本舉國哀悼，大本營海軍報道部長矢野英雄少將，特於二十一日下午七時半在東京廣播電台廣播，題爲「緬懷由本元帥』，歷時十五分鐘，矢野少將於廣播時，聲淚俱下，哀惋動人。大意謂：『聯合艦隊司令官山本元帥，已於南太平洋最前綫壯烈殉國，余於袞悼之餘，緬懷元帥之赫赫武勳與其壯烈之精神，實甚感歎。元帥自明治卅七年海軍兵學校畢業後，即服務軍界，已有四十年之久，其間曾以海軍少尉候補實之資格，參加日本海戰，身負重傷建立初陣之功。其後曾參加第一次世界大戰及數决戰爭，建立光輝武勳，其後並以航空戰隊司令官之資格，啓迪海軍航空隊之重要性，致力其建設。同時曾以全權委員隨員及代表資格出席華盛頓海軍軍縮會議，始終貫激我國之主張，返國後即任海軍航空本部部長之要職，確立吾國今日之海軍航空，後繼任海軍决官，處身於國際情勢複雜多事之間，努力於國事，復於昭和十四年任聯合艦隊司令長官，參加中日戰事，發揮陸海協力精神及其實力，使渝方退入內地，同時極力於實力强化後必勝方策之樹立，以應付此次大東亞戰爭。猶憶昭和十六年十二月八日我國對英，美宣戰，我國海軍當即覆滅英，美太平洋艦隊之主力，於以一瞬間其海軍實力驟减。自是以來，以疾風迅雷之勢，隨時，隨地擊被頑敵，擊毀敵方誇稱之包圍陣，復在印度洋，南太平洋，東太平洋實行大規模之作戰，並令一部海軍出擊美國本土西岸及澳洲南非方面各地，收獲光輝之戰果。開戰以來，爲時雖一年有半，而我國已在週圍建築堅固之據點，確立絕對優勢戰略，而奠定最後勝利之基礎，此種罕有之偉大戰果，實係聯合艦隊之作戰週密及統率應付得宜所致，其最高指揮官山本元帥之功勛，寳可傳之史册，永垂不杇。此次天皇陛下爲嘉其殊勳，特親臨元帥府賜以元帥謚號，並叙以大動位功一級，洵爲武人無上之榮譽。元帥自去年八月以來，屢躬臨激戰最烈之最前綫指揮作戰，表現超特戰鬥精神。同時全軍將士無不深爲感動，誓死殺敵。元帥壯烈殉國時，該方面正不分畫夜展熾烈之空戰中，元帥躬赴此激戰之最前綫，指導全盤作戰與敵交綏，終於在飛機上壯烈戰死，其壯烈健鬥精神，足爲日海軍全體將士永垂矜式。確信此當爲擊滅美英之一種推進力也。予自開戰前迄戰爭初期，曾被任爲聯合艦隊旗艦艦長，以是得晨夕隨侍元帥之左右，深印腦海中之元帥之人格，可謂剛毅穩健宏偉闊達兼而有之。在其健昻之體軀，癝然之態度中，更寓有慈父之溫容，海涵之氣度，誠不愧爲一完璧之領導者，令人肅然生敬也。尤以身臂聯合艦隊司令長官，肩荷我國興廢之重任，拜接擊滅英美之大詔前後之心境，更爲任何人所莫能臆測者，當時山本元帥之態度從容不迫，鎭定沉着，聯合艦隊將士均寄以無限之信賴與奮感焉。山本長官於開戰當時召集聯合艦隊各指揮軍官訓示時，曾稱：希諸君與本職共同生死，猶憶當時山本長官言如巖之中心，如神之風貌，終此身不能忘懷，當戰局日形重大時，獲接元帥戰死之噩耗，全軍將士不僅同深哀悼。但帝國海軍不僅屹然不動毫末，且將奉元帥之壯烈精神，敵愾同心，爲擊滅英美而向前邁進，予深信與國民諸君禀承元帥壯烈崇高精紳，正在此後焉。</p>
<h3>湘省日軍　確保第一綫陣地　山岳地帶機械戰成功</h3>
<p>漢口二十一日中央社電　據前綫二十一日來電，日軍於公安西方地區，對渝軍五個師展開之殲滅戰，於收獲偉大戰果後，已於十八日終了。渝（第十集團軍）主力已全被殲滅，（第八十七軍）其敗殘兵現仍於溫水街北方地區榜徨中，此光輝戰果，乃因日上部隊及航空部隊展開巧妙之立體作戰，及日將兵英勇奮鬥而獲得者。尤其日軍於山岳地帶展開機械戰，獲得成功，乃此次作戰之特色。緣日軍於十二日夜半，開始行動後，僅歷時三日，南下部隊與北上部隊，即於西齊北方取得連絡，此種進攻精神，渝軍並爲之啞然。八十七軍軍長高卓東，九十四軍軍長牟廷芳等，雖命令部下死守，然其本人則着便衣遁走，如斯日軍自洞庭湖畔殲滅戰開始以來，未出二旬，即於江南山野擊滅渝（第六戰區）主力第十九集團軍及第十集團軍主力，總計九個師的九萬，今已確保安鄕南縣枝江一帶蜿蜒二百公里之第一綫陣地。</p>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　此間某人士談稱：渝軍事委員會發言人，前於二十八夜就龐炳勳孫殿英兩將軍參加和運一事，曾作乖謬之解說，以圖遮掩事實，但是非曲直，自有事實可證，且龐氏認淸東亞情勢，爲興復中華，惟有和平，故而毅然參加和運，此種情况，更可粉碎渝方之惡意宣傳，再以投誠士兵達七萬衆一事而言，其事實眞僞，允可深知。</p>
<h3>美對渝方　撤廢移民法案</h3>
<p>南京二十一日中央社電　美國自於太平洋上戰敗後，即高唱反攻口號，藉以緩和國內空氣，於是竭力利用渝蔣，用以牽制日本，故於最近對渝有所謂撤廢治外法權等之舉以爲餌，日前又於會議中提出撤廢禁止華人移居法案，此舉亦不過爲懷柔渝蔣之一種慣技，吾人深知過去英美人對有色人種之種種卑劣毒辣手段，尤彰彰然予人目耳，無可隱飾，即對在美華僑之壓迫欺侮，言來實令人髮指，故美人此次所謂撤廢禁止移民法案，國人聞之均能洞悉其奸，不爲其詭計所欺，而反徵其一貫之狡猾手段，徒見心勞日拙而已。</p>
<p>東京二十一中央社電　近傳美國議員會於議會中提出廢止限制華人移民法案，在日華僑聞悉後，會自十六日起於神戶舉行全日本華僑大會四日，並向在美華僑及重慶同胞呼籲，勿爲英美謀略所惑，宜覺悟中日同生共死，與復興東亞之理念。</p>

<h3>阿爾及里亞沿海岸　義機攻擊敵護航隊　柏林前晚發表在北非戰果　反軸心軍損失三十餘萬人</h3>
<p>羅馬二十一日中央社電　義軍司令部昨午發表：義空軍連日於阿爾及里亞沿岸海面攻擊敵護送船團，十九日以魚雷擊沉中型船舶二艘，並重創一萬噸級船舶一艘。又軸心空軍曾空襲阿蘭西吉厄里斯發克斯三軍港，收獲相當戰果。</p>
<p>里斯本二十一日中央社電　據此間昨晚接獲消息，反軸心當局在突尼西亞已逮捕一千餘人。阿爾及爾無綫電宣稱：反軸心當局現仍搜捕「叛徒與軸心合作者及敵方人員」。</p>
<p>柏林二十一日中央社電　此間昨晚宣稱：軸心軍在突尼西亞奮勇抗戰半載之結果，使英。美侵略者損亡三七〇·〇〇〇人以上，其中並有將官二十五人，突境之反軸心軍人力及物力，雖皆大爲優越，但仍不免被德軍俘獲一二〇·〇〇〇人，其中有將官十八人，反軸心之陣亡者在五萬以上，其中有將官七人，反軸心之傷兵共計約廿萬人。反軸心坦克車在非戰爭中，喪失於德軍之手者共七三三七輛，在戰爭進行中，關於北非德軍實力當然不能發表，其實在六個月之前，德軍僅以傘兵及步兵二百三十八人，在突尼西亞登陸設立安全之橋頭堡，以備其後不久德軍相繼而至。當斯時也，法軍態度曖昧，而反軸心之坦克車隊亦已迫近，此種偉舉之能有成就，蓋山於德軍之奪獲反軸心軍大宗軍用品。例如在埃爾米基里德軍坦克車七輛奪獲反軸心摩托車二千輛，俘獲二千人，德軍賴此項車輛及同時奪獲之燃料方能前進。至羅美爾元帥於一九四二年夏向阿拉眠進攻如是其猛烈，蓋亦由於軸心軍隊會奪獲英第八軍之車輛幾達其全部，並奪得幾足供三個月用之燃料曁大砲及重武器甚多。在北非作戰之兩年半中，德軍曾以自反軸心軍方面奪得之戰利品補充其運載車百分之八十，軍器及軍火百分之四十，坦克車百分之五十及燃料百分之三十。</p>
<h3>華盛頓前日召開　太平洋軍事會議　羅斯福邱吉爾等均出席　傳斯達林將列席下次會</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城二十一日中央社電　據華盛頓來電，美總統羅斯福昨召開太平洋軍事會議，參加者有英首相邱吉爾，駐美大使哈里法克斯，加拿大首相金格，駐美公使瑪加錫，渝方代表宋子文，澳洲，新西蘭等各國代表多人。正午起開會，就太平洋戰局曾作全面之檢討，的歷一小時半。</p>
<p>里斯本二十一日中央社電　據紐約消息稱：邱吉爾首相及羅斯福總統，昨日參加太平洋戰事會議，大致係聽取各參謀人員會議之結果，加拿大總理金氏亦參與會議。</p>
<p>里斯本二十一日中央社電　今日此間接華盛頓電訊，美京外交界人士皆信，斯達林將參加下次羅斯福，邱吉爾討論全世界戰略之會議。倘使羅斯福總統對於設法邀請斯達林出席事，毫無保證，邱吉爾在美國會中之演設，決不敢一再表示此項願望，因此種會議之失敗，結果徒將造成各有關方面之煩惱也。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城二十一日中央社電　據　大瓦來電，加拿大國防相羅爾斯頓，爲參加華盛頓會談，特偕同將校三人，自鄂太瓦出發赴華盛頓。</p>
<h3>斯達林前晚　接見台維斯</h3>
<p>安加拉二十一日中央社電　莫斯科廣播電台宣稱：斯達林昨夜在克里姆林宮接見羅斯福總統之特使合維斯，蘇外長莫洛托夫，美大使史丹萊上將均在座。</p>
<p>莫期科二十一日中央社電　美總統特使台維斯，二十日往訪蘇聯外交人民委員長莫洛托夫舉行會談。渠於事前會見記者團時曾談稱：予因僅係以使者名義被遣來此，故對於羅斯福總統致斯達林委員長親筆函內容完全不明。現預定於接到斯達林委員長之回答後，即歸返華盛頓。</p>
<p>日內瓦二十一日中央社電　據德國新聞社引倫敦消息稱：蘇聯駐美大使李維諾夫，星期四抵達德黑蘭，首途赴莫斯科。</p>
<h3>日機炸摩勒斯比　美海部承認兩島陣地被炸　西南太平洋日空軍佔優勢</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城二十一日中央社電　據墨爾缽來電，西南太平洋反軸心軍司令部二十一日發表，日航空部隊曾於二十日夜猛炸摩勒斯比。</p>
<p>里斯本二十一日中央社電　華盛頓來訊：昨日美海軍部公報，承認五月十八日晚間日機又轟炸瓜達爾加那爾及羅錫爾兩島之美軍陣地。</p>
<p>里斯本二十一日中央社電　據美京消息，美國第五航空軍團參謀長，兼新幾內亞空軍司令史密斯上校談稱：西南太平洋之日本空軍，與該區反軸心空軍相較，的佔二比一之擾勢。紐不列顚之日空軍，在過去五個月中，亦已增加一倍</p>
<h3>莫斯科南　蘇集重兵</h3>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電　據德國新聞社軍事通訊員哈瑪上校由東綫報吿稱：蘇方仍賡續在莫斯科之南結集重兵，允其在哥斯克地方，蘇方努力集中步兵及坦克車師團。此外並集中砲隊，蘇方似對夏季大攻勢已完成其準備，蓋德軍在奧萊爾前綫壓迫甚急，將危及莫斯科，故蘇軍不久將有反攻計劃之實現也。</p>
<h3>日英戰術思想的縣殊（二）</h3>
<p>— 伊藤正德</p>
<p>（六）日本提督的所　謂擊滅</p>
<p>日本的提督不但要早點發生戰鬥，而且隨着爲戰術之根柢的作戰計劃的要求，以先截斷敵人的退路爲主體而決定實行展開。然而有時會很迅速地在西南展開，一直南下、整　從最後面包圍敵人的一種戰鬥形態吧。因此，五點五十五分的右舷展開是最好，六點另七分的右舷展開（此時德主力的位置和方向略可認淸）、决之。五點五十五分，敵艦還沒有看見，而且海上濛氣很多，因而惟恐水雷攻擊的提督就覺得有所顧慮吧。雖然如此、倘若擊滅敵人是目的。那簡直就一點也不能躊躇。</p>
<p>請來看一看日本海的東鄉元帥！請來看一看加藤參謀長！東鄕長官是用什麽戰略而臨海戰的呢？正如大多數讀者所知道的，那就是『擊成」。美國海軍也是喜歡這句話的，在戰術目的裏，用Aunihilation個字做定義。但他們只知道紙上談兵，東鄕元帥却把這句話在日水海裏實演了。問題歸到將什麽來償「擊滅」的代價這一點。</p>
<p>東鄉元帥實在是可以犧牲我們的大部分艦隊的這種決意而臨之的。這在臨到決戰的將帥，是最重要的決意。智勇這句話，也可以說是爲要說明將帥在這種塲合上的態度而存在的。擊敗敵人的智謀，也需要許多優秀的幕僚，不過『可以犧牲我們的大部分艦隊」的戰法，是只有將帥一個人可下決斷的。一切的損害都由長官一人負責。所以他是在判定犧牲多少好呢這個前提之下指揮全軍的。</p>
<p>司令長官東鄉平八郞，雖然沒有明示捨棄主力艦六隻中的幾隻，準主力艦，（裝甲大巡洋艦）六隻中的幾隻的數字，但即使犧牲大，分也要斷乎完成「擊滅」的決意部是很確實的。</p>
<p>（註）關於此事，筆者於一九二三年五月和在湯河原休養中的加藤友三郞首相（日本海海戰時的參謀長）會談時，親自聽到他闡述爲該海戰之中樞戰術的二直角轉囘，是東鄉和加藤間得着諒解的海戰戰略。</p>
<p>（七）不冒險就得不到勝利</p>
<p>單純的勝利，是不放在東鄕長官的眼裏的。他只有「擊滅」。在參謀秋山眞之所起草的有名的海戰第一報吿（呈大本營，海戰直前提出）中，有『聯合艦隊將立刻出動擊滅之」的一句話，這擊減成了旗艦三笠號的司令部裏的口號，所以秋山也沒有什麽誇張，不過將這採錄了吧了。而當時幾乎不使用殲滅這句話。擊滅是在同一的意義上被使用着的當時將擊滅解作澈底的大勝利，是表現不常發生的決戰戰鬥中的全勝的大事業的。『要擊滅」的一句話，是所以引起六千萬國民的尙武精神的。</p>
<p>然而爲了擊滅，自己這邊也會相當被擊沉。但若這樣憂慮，就不能擊滅。只能獲得單純的勝利而已。旣然如此，就可以作這稱的結論：日本海海戰倒是失敗的。——這是在東鄉元帥的意料之中的。不喪失自己的艦隊，而使敵人的艦隊完全覆滅這種如意算盤，是極其危險的戰術思想，結果一定失掉戰爭。犧牲自己的一半而擊斃敵人的全部，這是決戰的要諦，是桌上已定的戰術論。實行這戰術的，只是限於名將。如果犧牲自己的一半而不能擊倒敵人，就是敗北。相信勝利，相信勝利的戰術，測度戰果而投軍於戰塲，即是名將的德性。這裏一定有某種程度的危險率，也有相當的損害。若無爲決勝而冒險，爲大局而甘受損害的膽量，就不能進行大決戰。所以束鄉元帥能在日本海決戰，琪利科不能在加德蘭海決戰。</p>
<p>關於犧牲之點，普通的將士，自不待言；戰爭的門外漢，是難以得到正確的觀念的。戰勝敵人的時候，就立即顧慮自己的損害。這樣也好，但慾望逐漸增大，希望自己毫無損害而戰勝敵人，不久變爲雪利芬所說的『被愛好的觀念』，至於以得勝誤認爲常軌。這樣，絕對不能得到大勝利。這是不可不警戒的。</p>
<p>（八）東鄉元帥的二直角展開</p>
<p>自己縱然受了極大的犧牲，但敵艦一隻也不給它逃走，這是東鄕元帥的目標。兩三隻小軍艦的漏綱，是出於萬不得已的，不過主力艦以下的優秀的各艦型，都非擊沉不可：東鄉元帥是照這樣的戰略目的和決意到戰塲上去的。非擊沉不可的，不是敵艦的數量，而是敵艦的全部。琪利科不然。將德艦隊逐囘到德國的軍港裏去，是他的載略目的。換言之：琪利科以封鎖德國艦隊壓制北海活動爲第一個目標，在遭遇戰時給與打擊爲第二個目標。關於他的戰術思想，在後面還要提及；不過前面所說的目的，和東鄕長官的使敵艦一隻也不能逃走的目標，是完全相反的。</p>
<p>所以琪利科的戰鬥展開，先以安全爲絕對的條件，其間設法不爲德軍的一彈一雷所擊中。下午六點十五分，這時右舷展開（一）也是提早交戰，而且（二）是截斷敵人退路的方法；然而琪利科却向左舷展開，避免立刻和敵人接觸，採取從遠處逐漸加以壓迫的戰法，使開戰的時間更其延遲了。</p>
<p>（註）皮梯，托瑪斯，及右翼戰隊的白納中將，在這轉瞬問以前，都豫期着右舷展開。</p>
<p>東鄕元帥的有名的二直角展開，和琪利科是對角綫地正相反的。這是上文所引的戰略目的和戰術思想的天淵之隔所生出的當然結果。然而，只是這點是不夠說明日本提督的展開的。就是最簡單地作一說明，「一面任敵人自由砲擊，一面整備自己的決戰狀態的大決斷」這一行，是必要的。這就是使向南西航行着的艦隊，在敵前八千米突完全轉向北東，以現出併航戰的態勢。我們的、王力各艦，隨着旗艦三笠號的轉同航跡繞一個圓圈，旋轉軸只成了一點，敵人如果向這一點集中砲火，就會得到一定命中的利益，恰恰相反；我們轉同時敵人沒有開砲，所以不利是很明白的。</p>
<p>果然，三笠號以下各艦早已中了數彈。但是從最初就抱着這種決心的東鄕長官，毫不在意。而所以採取這種態勢者，是因爲在擊滅敵人的主力戰上，斷然實行壓抑敵艦艦首的斜行併舷戰之故。最初受一點攻擊，爲了撃滅的目的，是完全不成問題的。像這樣的危險，是認爲理所常然的。由此可知與琪利科的展開有天壤之差吧。（蕭：譯自五月號中央公論…全篇未完待續）</p>

<p>谷大使又於下午四時，在百老匯大厦宿舍會見記者，發表就任感想。並關於强力推進對華政策，以及其他當前問題，發表談話如决：「到達南京後所感覺者，即當五年前之民國二十七年春，余會在南京，當時距南京陷落後爲時未久，居民稀少，且各處均尙殘有機關槍座，然此次前赴南京，則以前有機關槍座之處，已樹有孫文先生銅像，昔日之血腥氣息完全滌除，充滿和平氣象，尤以離間中日情感之第三國以至敵性勢力，最近均已完全肅淸。因帝國實施對華新政策，中日兩國相互之信賴與理解益見加深，無任忻快，加深中日兩國之信賴與理解，實係今後對華政策之要諦，日本當竭盡努力以向前推進。余上决來滬，英美勢力尙極强大，大東亞戰爭亦未爆發，英美常思擁護自國權益，而阻碍日本作戰，在此期間，余竭力澗滑與第三國之權利摩擦，經過如此過程後，中日兩國民卒發見眞正提携之道，齊向正確方面推進。對華新政策並非係另一新政策，乃以驅除不法勢力，建築根據眞正道義之自一八四二年鴉片戰爭以來，英美獲得租界以及其他權益，作爲侵略東亞之根據地，爲驅除此種英美勢力，日本自須採取保全東亞措置，乃首先撤廢治外法權，交還租界以及實施其他爲强化新中國所必要之政策。此乃爲根據萬邦各得其所之肇國大精神，而實施之當然歸結，因此新政策母寗可謂爲維新政策或眞正政策也。中日兩國應澈底理解此種事實，幷排除敵方宣傳，可不待言。大東亞戰爭中帝國收得煊赫戰果，目下東亞南北業巳完成鐵壁陣綫，今决戰爭因不僅爲武力戰，必須舉各國各民族之總力，以求最後勝利。國民政府亦爲完成此種目的竭盡全力，協力日本完成戰爭。目前中日兩國政府之重要措置，乃爲强化國府政治力，及復興中國經濟，安定民生是也。此僅爲根據對華政策振發精神之具體方策而已。對華政策始終予以强力推進，所必要之各方面情勢等，當予以充分檢討，以期竭盡全力而求新政策之推進」云。</p>

<p>今日經濟界移第六版</p>
<p>短評</p>
<h3>急賬華北災民的人事</h3>
<p>華北急賑工作，我們總覺得要以絕對的敏捷動作，處理一切。因爲在飢餓中的災民，一分一秒鐘都處於輾轉呻吟的痛苦之中。我們的賑物，能够提早一分一秒到達，就减少他們一分一秒的痛苦。甚至因提早一分一秒的時間，而得救垂斃的多數災民，也是極可能的事。</p>
<p>所以，我們要求迅速成立一個集中事權的急賑機構。這機構能把握統一的力量，能發揮敏捷的機能。牠的主持人選，必須是素孚人望社會公認的廉正人士。時機已迫，實在不能姍姍其遲了。我們盼望　政府、王管機關，迅速領導籌組，幷銓衡適當人選。</p>
<p>我們已經說過，在上海的市民中，對於華北災民具有惻隱和同情心的，實佔多數。所以，募集捐款，把握甚大。這於本報五日之間，收到捐款十萬元，以及無數同情函件的兩點上，足以證明。可是，有了捐款，怎樣的使捐款人的一分，災民得到十足一分的實惠？不負捐款人的熱心，同時更不負災民的喁望。因此，我們主張放賑的人選，格外需要廉正。將來由上海的華北賑災機構裏推選代表，實地發放。記得從前某决賑濟會中，某宿儒曾說：放賬事宜，必須選「窮念書人」去辦，因爲他有窮骨氣，有窮道德，有窮經騐，而更有不愛黃白物，不講情面的書獃子的獃氣。這是我們理想的放賑人才。値得先提出的一點。</p>
<p>北京通訉</p>
<h3>北京食粳問題</h3>
<p>— 學子</p>
<p>在五月四日中德學會成立十週年紀念會的演講中，王蔭泰督辦曾經說過一句話：「現在是述衣食起居都成了問題的時候。」衣食起居之成爲北京目前的大難題，確是不可掩飾的事實，而由督辦公開的說出來，其嚴重性也就可想而知了。</p>
<p>北京這座古城，從藝術建築的觀點上說，雖然是和羅馬，巴黎號稱世界的三大美城。然而他的光榮，却是建築在人工的修飾上，而不是自然的發展。這是坐落在一塊半沙漠狀態的平原中的一個都市。因爲在二十萬年以前就有人類，所謂「北京猿人」居住。土地的元氣早已耗費殆盡，經濟的資源實在是很有限的。在平常時節，他的繁榮完全是由世界各角落的力是來支持的。可是現在已經不是這個時候了。</p>
<p>北京的糧食，一向是仰給於外地。從前是由運河把江南的米穀帶來給帝王脚跟下的臣民；海運開放以來，則澳洲的麵粉，安南，暹羅，緬甸的白米，每年是不知數量的傾倒在這裏。就是在七七事件以後，因爲海運的繼續存在，也沒有受過多大的影饗。可是前年十二月以後，這座古城已被丟在沙漠之巾，和外界完全隔絕了。因此糧食的問題也就一天一天的嚴重起來；又因爲一般囤虎‘作祟，現在是連上等之家都發起愁來了。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭勃發的時候，米價是一包不到一百元，就是到去年年底也還不過是二百元左右，可是過了年一切都飛漲，現在是一包五百五十元以上。即以最最劣的粗糧而論，其中包含有花生殼磨成的粉，樹皮的粉，以前飼猪用的豆餅粉等等成分的雜合麵，已是每斤價値一元七八角。一個人每天的食糧至少需要兩斤，就得三四元的糧價，還沒有算其他的，如果有家庭的擔負；其困難將更不堪設想。然而一般人的經濟力量不但沒有增加，反而是减少，因爲爲到處都緊縮，而在找不到職業的情况之下，薪水低仍不能不挨着肚子去接受。結果是只能在生活的費用上想節流。節流的第一方法是减少傭人，平均以前可以用七個傭人的，現在只用一個。然而以而只能用一個的怎未辦呢？現在是自己兼職，同時又得把三頓飯改成兩頓，甚至於只能吃最粗的糙糧所然成的所謂稀粥。以前根本用不起傭人的，現在則只好把生命交給死神了。我們可以在報紙上看到許多關於文人學士餓死的消息，然而文人學士有人在報紙上誌哀，而一般平民之餓死者，却只換得人們的掩鼻而過。去年有一個著名的敎授曾經理直氣壯的說：「好過壞過總有法子過，天下絕沒有餓死這一囘事，我就從來沒有聽說餓死過人！」現在是事寳勝過雄辯，而不久之前我又聽見這位名敎授垂頭喪氣的嘆息：「怎末辦呢？這不是要餓死了嗎？」</p>
<p>華北常局對這嚴重的糧食問題，確曾下過極大的努力，想謀一個解決的辦法。去年的物價緊急對策委員會，今年的物資物價處理委員會，和物價協力委員會，也就爲着客觀環境需要而組織起來了。報紙上時常可以看到處罰奸商的消息。然而奸商的良心是黑的，意志是鐵的，並不因此而有絲毫的畏懼之心。本年二月間，因爲國虎們前散佈謠言，說是南北的幣制不久就將合流，一時金價狂漲，居然在一日之中從一兩五百四十元漲至九百元，再於兩星期問漲至一千六百元以上。這而且只是掛牌的明價，事實上過買不到的，暗盤交易的金價已超的了二千元的關頭。筏來是王督辦是一篇聯鈔價格穩定的宣言把他壓下來，囘跌至一千元左右的明價。可是王督辦自南京同來所發表的「南米北運」的聲明，却並沒有使糧價囘跌。當局對於糧食問題，也確是不斷地在努力，內務總署在東西城設立的兩個粥廠，是救活了不少的生命。每月以廉價配給每人七八斤的糧食，雖無濟於大事，對於市民總算不無小補，而滿蒙雜糧的輸入，蘇淮豫北小麥的北上都在交涉之巾。另外則華北物資物價委員會。又於五月五日佈吿商民呈報存糧數目，「勸告存糧商民凡所存超通該戶口半年之消費量者，迅將所存種類數量自動報告，俾關係機關得以適當價格收買其超過量數，以便公允分配。」此外，每日的報紙上也都有勸告商民拋賣糧食的論說。然而這些論說能夠收到多少效果，購不敢說。這幾天的報紙在「糧價跌落」的標題下，每天都加上「再行」兩個字，然而拿着這登載有「糧價再行跌落」的報紙到糧食店一問，則仍是大米每斤三元二角，小米每斤二元四角。而最値得注意者，是每次配給的糧價也一次高過一决。上一次每斤八角的麵價，這一次却增至一元二角。不過當局的努力，至少是把糧價安定，不該其再行暴漲。自王督辦到南京去交涉南米北來的時候起到現在，糧價的起落是有限的。這不能不說是常局的成功。</p>
<p>據說張家口的小米，每斤只値三毛錢，扛南的大米每包値儲券七百元。如果海運的阻碍斷絕了古城的國外的糧食來源，近代的交通綫却能夠在四十八小之內把江南的大米轉運到北京來，救救這二百五十萬垂死的蕭生。然而由王督辦派往南京接洽華北食糧問題的建設總署公路局局長程式峻氏，却於四月二十一日抵南京，甫行下車，即感身體不適，旋人中央醫院治療，迨至二十七日因病勢轉劇，竟爾辭世。（見四月三十日實報）難道說這是北京糧食問題前途的預兆嗎？（五月十六日）</p>

<h3>敎與養</h3>
<p>— 余懷瑞</p>
<p>中國人對於孩子的觀念、素來只注重於養而忽略於教；換句話說，他們只求其量的衆多而漠視於質的精湛，所以只要他們生時兒孫滿堂，死後訃聞上能印上長長的一排名字，便認爲無上的幸福與光榮了，所以「五世同堂』在中國數千年來一直被共認着爲最「榮譽」的事情。至於孩子將來在學問上，事業上的成就，對於社會和人羣的服務能力，甚至於有沒有做一個「人」的資格，這種種問題便都置之不問了。中國人雖然開口閉口的拿「人口衆多」來自傲傲人，却往往一切者不如人口少於我們的別的國家，對於孩子的養而不敎，便是其中最大的原因。所以我們對於孩子的觀念，應該質重於量，敎重於養。魯迅先生說：「中國需要的是人的父母，不是孩子的父母。」眞是一針見血的話。</p>
<p>近年來，由於進步思想的輸入，和國內從事兒童敎育者的鼓吹，不少做父母的對於這敎問題漸汽車的注意起來了，這是可喜的現象。不過對於敎的方法，卻尙有加以探討的必要。</p>
<p>父母的地位，在中國向來是被認爲尊嚴不可侵犯的，所以很</p>
<p>這是一種錯誤的方法。要知道孩子是一朶嫩弱的蓓蕾，任他像野草似的自生自滅果然不是辦法；但放在屋內，用繩索鉛絲等綁紮起來，只加以肥料的灌漑，希望他依着自己所愛好的形式生長起來，也定必生氣毫無，甚至會中途天折。因爲蓓蕾有着他自己的個性，而且他不但需要肥料的灌溉，還需要陽光的照射和雨露的滋潤呀！所以有經騐的花匠除了給予必需的陽光和雨露之外，從不强制蓓蕾必須依着怎樣的形式生長，他只順着蓓蕾的個性讓它自由發展，他明白花匠的責任不過在旁邊設法除去阻碍蓓蕾生長的像雜草等類的東西罷了。這樣蓓蕾才能茂密繁榮，開花結果。所以做父母的人假使希望自己的孩子將來有所成就，那就該除去父母傳統的外衣，用愛爲陽光，循循善誘的態度爲雨露，來做一個扶植栽培這嫩弱的蓓蕾的花匠！</p>
<h3>交通銀行投考記</h3>
<p>— 落第</p>
<p>拿了一張大學文憑忽忽地到目的地去報名，一種莫名其妙的幻想立刻爬進了我底頭腦，「假使我錄取了，那麼我底第一個月薪水一定要好好地利用一下，做件新衣服；不，買雙新皮鞋；哦！應該寄給媽」。</p>
<p>「你是誰介糾的？中學還是大學？」辦事員在問。</p>
<p>「誰介紹的！」我頓時朵了一下，我想我沒有誰介紹，我祗是一個朋友打了個電話給我，關照我說交通銀行在招考試用行員，資格是大學畢業，叫我不妨去試他一試。</p>
<p>「這裏，沒有人介紹是不許報名的」。</p>
<p>我急急地用電話去詢問那位吿訴消息給我的朋友，正是蒙他的好意，替我想出一個辦法，拉了個「介紹人」，於是我昻然地又走進「投考試用行員報名處。」</p>
<p>「你是誰介紹的，中學還是大學？」辦事員依然這樣淡淡地詢問。</p>
<p>「我是×××介紹的，大學畢業」接着便把我那張白以爲得意的大學文憑呈遞上去，交換了一張名單，我小心地把文一一塡上，看了一邇無悮，便大胆地交上去，看上去報名費是不要的，心裏已寬了一口氣，我想「到底是家大銀行，這一些紙張費也不收。』</p>
<p>『還缺三張照片。</p>
<p>那可糟啦，三張照片那兒來呢，即使去拍也來不及吧，但，沒照片是不行的，沒奈何，祗得跑進照相館叫他照三片加快的照，「派司照最快」於是常天我拿到了三張似乎像自己的照片交了進去，大概是照片太不行吧，辦事員對我細細地看了二分鐘，最後他發給我一張「體格檢騐表」，內中有一條是「醫師體格檢騐費七元五角由投考者自理」。</p>
<p>「七元五角」我一而看着這四個字，一面伸手往袋裏一摸巧得很，我袋裏有二張五元的還有四張單元的，那就夠了，我瞞着家去檢査身體，在醫師診所裏恭候了大半個鐘頭，幸運地叫到了我底名字，我走進「檢査室」，一眼看見有一位「試用員」正赤着轉在檢査肺部，看護叫我砰秤身重，「那麼輕，祗一百〇二磅，」『不對，不對！我曾在永安公司裏磅也有一百十磅「我意欲這樣能使我的體重表示得重一點，但看護小妣依然只肯把一百〇二磅的紀錄寫在卡紙上。開始脫光上衣了，我眞怕，第一因爲天氣還很　，我實在有些吃不消；第二脫出來瘦得像根排骨也實在難看，但，脫還總得脫，從醫師的面部表情上看去，似乎他對我這種的身體不表示十分地滿意，他問我咳嗽不有？生過病不有？我底同答是一槪沒有，我强辯我底身體很好。</p>
<p>三天後接到一張通告准予考試，喜歡得了不得，於是照着那張考試日程表預備功課，讀了經濟想着商算，讀了會計又想着國文，眞是急得要命，好容易等到三號下午，一輛常車把我送至大同大學門口，我慢慢地走了進去，離開一點半還差二十分鐘，考塲裏似乎已「客滿」了，我舉目一眺，老幼不一；神氣的也有；起碼的也有；在用英文談話的也有；在利用最後一分鐘的也有。第一塲外國語似乎還便當，改錯，自薦信，繙譯，作文等數題，第二塲商算，出了好幾問大代數及三角的題目，我讀商科，四年以來從未碰見的東西，想不到在今天相會，看看容易，做去不成功，眞是啼笑皆非，第二天，振作精神再考，國文二題：一是作文一是公文，好壞自己不得而知，接下去是經濟典會計，也許是自己讀這一門吧，看上去似乎比其他容易些。</p>
<p>一課堂的大學生，到底取多少呢？我有些懷疑起來了，果然，一張『考字第不列號全頁」的通知書最後現在我底眼前了，我垂頭喪氣地去領同那張自以爲寳貴的大學文憑，我一邊走，一邊伸手往袋裏一摸，袋裏的中儲券顯然少了許多，啊！「偷鷄不着蝕把米」。</p>
<h3>日本海軍異聞錄</h3>
<p>— 大下宇陀兒</p>
<p>（三）飛機的進步</p>
<p>代代木練　塲上，看熱　的人們人山人海。</p>
<p>這天，明治四十三年十二月十四日，日野大尉乘格拉台式飛機飛行於日本的天空。</p>
<p>發動機的整理，已經費了大半天的辰光，從早晨起直至午前十時。漸漸地開始在草地上滑走了。一陣橫風吹過，飛機就跌倒了，翼端上的支持也折斷了。於是又費了五小時的修理，於午後三時再開始滑走。觀衆們嘩然大叫起來。歐聲電動。飛機比汽車還要走得快，可是祇在地上走。戰衆們說：</p>
<p>「傳說中的飛機，似乎還要快呢！」</p>
<p>「確然，很好的東西，那不是嗎？汽車也恐怕比不過他罷！』</p>
<p>在觀衆們紛紛議論聲中，滑走漸漸地順利起來，機體到底離開地面上上昇了（不過只有一米高）。這樣子飛了的三〇米，喝采的聲音，轟然如雷，歷久不止。可是飛機又遭到了橫風，倒落地上，支持又折斷了。之後聽說又修理起來，上昇至十米，飛行了約六〇米。到明年，有了很大的進步，德川大尉乘普萊里亞機往返於所澤—川越問，費了三二分四五秒的時間，飛越了三九，三粁的距離。次日，再是原地方飛行一次，但這次沒有同到到川澤來。墜落於川越附近的桑田中。四年後，大正五年，海軍航空隊出現了。以後的進步，比以前的快得多了。不再有被橫風可以吹倒的飛機了。竟可以在茫茫大空中，作渡洋轟炸了。支柱不會再折斷了。大東亞戰勃發，我陸海軍飛機在浩渺的太平洋中，飛來飛去不常一會事。將來或許可以進步，到隨便那裏都可以去了。如其有載重量二千噸，航續距離九千哩的飛機能夠製造成功，祇要用飛機，就可以掌握太平洋的制海權了。到這時候，飛機當然不再需要滑道，並且竟可以隨便在空中什麽地方可以任意停止繫泊。</p>
<p>如據美國的宣傳，目前　層　飛行正在硏究中，並且計劃用非常好的大型機，搭載着小型機前來空襲日本，正在着着進行中。又據報紙的傳播，德國正在製造橫渡大西洋轟炸紐約，華盛頓的飛機。</p>
<p>可是，我們並不恐懼，我們將因守日本。我們應該遵從防空訓練中海軍的標語「訓練如實戰，寳戰如訓練」。如其有燒夷彈落下，我們就把這燒夷彈當作在我本土上落的敵兵。這敵兵是持有火燄放射器及手溜彈的暴奴。而我尊貴的日本本土上，晰不容敵兵有片刻的停留。在前綫，我們的父，兄，子，流着血，跨過屍體，向同樣兇暴的敵人作殊死戰。而在後方，日本人也有同樣的戰鬭意志。</p>
<p>海軍的某中佐說：</p>
<p>「我們祇想到在戰塲上戰勝敵人。後方的一切有勞諸君了。」</p>
<p>對的，杞人憂天，儘可不必。祇要盡了後方的資任，那就行了。（翼：譯自西部朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>站崗隨筆</h3>
<p>— 斯人</p>
<p>三天前接到一張自警團員　崗通知單，經我略略考慮一脅後，決定自己去站崗。有人說，憑着你職務上的身份可以申請豁免的，但我目前並不設法企圖獲得這秤方便。至於我這次所以毅然站崗的話，說得動聽一點，就是處此戰時體制實施下的大上海都市裏，自警團站崗正是每個市民應盡的一份義務吧；但實在我僅是抱着一種嘗試的心意去站崗的。</p>
<p>站崗的一天到了，時間自下午六時起至九時。我提早吃了晚飯，準時向聯保辦事處報到。我左臂得套上一個滿沾灰塵汚蹟的自警團臂章，左肩斜掛着一條嵌懸一支警笛和下端繫有一束蔴繩的草綠色布帶，右手裏還執着一根街頭巡捕慣用的短棒。這樣裝束好了，我就挺起胸膛走往指派定的二十二號崗亭裏去。</p>
<p>崗事實在是一個木籠子，裏面的有三尺見方的容積，上面四周都裝置着玻璃窗，可以轉眼透視四處。我拉開了門跨進籠子裏時，發見底板上散滿着許多瓜子殼和香烟屁股，這可以想見幾位先進者的籠中生活頗爲優閒自得的。能裏後而原裝着一條薄板，可供坐望，不料板已被竊，我祗好直挺挺站着瞧望。前人馬虎，後入吃苦，我心裏不禁浮起一絲怨意。</p>
<p>隔馬路正直立着一座××宮，全部門面牆壁新塗上一層朱紅油漆：左去不到數丈地方，有的是巍然一座××宮，門面牆壁也是新飾的，這是一大片黃金色的油漆。這兩宮道家都新裝門面，相互輝映，目的却都在招攬生意罷了。這種搶生意的姿態，和那比櫛述鱗的懸掛着大廉價旗幟的普通店舖是一樣一庸俗，看啦，××宮大門上不明明裝置着一個很大的「道」字嗎，這顯然表明了他們是生財有大道的。這時，我却想起自警團方面，從未見過有和尙道士們站崗，這倒有些不解了。也許和尙道士自古屬於方外人，而今也該不同於一般市民這樣的遵從戰時體制吧？</p>
<p>幾輛並坐着一對靑年男女的三輪車駛過時，我看見一個衣衫破碎的年老乞丐，跑去緊追着車中人乞求賜與，眞是拚着命不捨的跟着車子跑。這種謀生的姿態實在並不足怪，試想在今百物昻張無已之際，誰個不在肌餓綫上拚命掙扎着呢？所以，如果說，乞兒的生活是可憐的，那麼我們一般人的生活何嘗不夠可憐！其間相差僅是五十步和百步罷了。如果說，乞兒生活是卑鄙的，我們姑不論別的階層中人。就舉一個人人歆羨的官爺們爲例吧，那請你一請宗臣報劉一丈書，便知官爺生活也是奔走匍匐時首乞求的。這是自古已然，而於今爲烈！</p>
<p>誰說三小時會像一縷輕烟般容易溜過？我這樑直挺挺站着，站着，到底兩條腿彎裏感覺到陣陣的酸痛了！幸而自己從前曾常過幾年教員，每天總有三四小時站立在教室裏，因此，這兩條腿可說受過相當訓練；同時，我這次原抱着嘗試精神，常然頗能忍受種種不舒服。所以，我終於在咬緊牙關裏度過了三小時的籠中生活。九點鐘到了，我惟恐不速的跳出崗事去銷差，直似一隻被拘的鳥溜出籠子飛往天空，這時我身心滿感到何等自由自在的樂趣！</p>
<h3>觀盆栽展覽會</h3>
<p>— 棠棣</p>
<p>長日無聊，驅車赴八仙橋靑年會觀盆栽展覽會。會塲假座二樓圖書館；大小盆景，不下數百點。盆不盈尺，溪山如畫，樓閣參差，各具匠心，其中如陳梅靑之松柏，自然不减當年。孔志淸之「游烟疎雨」，「羣仙祝壽」，「古柏參天』絲絲入畫，非斵輪老手，曷克臻此？另有『山居圖』一幅，竟是六如手法。瘦鵑素以善培古木見長，本屆所陳，允稱妙品。而卓朵之廢紙盆景，居然生趣盎然，爲全塲僅見。彭菊洲之「枯木鴛鴦」，老幹自石隙盤空；「丹成入九天」，陶製葫蘆中，一枝斜出，巧思獨到。黃警頑紫叔瑜之怪石數座　或偃臥或劍立，嵯峨萬狀，而「桂林一角」，「層巒聳翠」山勢雄偉，戰後上海，已頗尠見。至於素有石　之徐氏昆仲子華子齡，此次出品中之「江村消夏」，「赤壁夜遊」，等件，不特結構新奇，允能顧及色彩調和，令人爽心悅自。全塲巨幅，以「洞天福地」爲最，石隙中，高達二尺之古柏挺秀，當非一朝一夕之功。山洞中，老道執拂靜坐，視之使人油然生出塵之想。總之本屆所陳各點，質與量，均較上屆進步，不負靑年會提倡高尙娛樂之旨趣。聞該會自今日起，不收門票，展覽三日，售花景所得提成充當小農貸金及華北賬濟旱災之用。</p>

<h3>簡易重傷治療法</h3>
<p>— 黃濟美</p>
<p>丁惠康博士最近在保甲靑年部演講重傷風治療法，極爲簡易、據稱患電傷風者，僅須在晚上睡覺的時候，把朝南窗戶完全開放，惟朝東西北方向之窗，均須關閉，這樣睡到天亮起來，那末重傷風症，就會立即痊愈，縱使隔晚睡時是咳嗽很厲害的，而今天起來就會完全斷根，越是屬害越有效騐，並且丁先生能夠担保及負責。當時我們聽了丁先生的重傷風治療法以後，不禁哄堂大笑，以爲這種治療法，每個部員都不會相信的，可是不幸的我，自從聽了丁先生所講的重傷風治療法之後，過了三天眞個患着重傷風症了，在這時候我對於丁先生講給我們聽的治療法，就欲一試。等到第二天，重傷風非但不愈，反而更加厲害，我決計將丁先生的治療法來實騐一下，觀其有否效騐。打定了主意，一到晚上，即依照丁先生所講的法子而睡，眞奇怪，等到天亮醒來的時候，而我所患的重傷風症，果然　然地痊愈，這種又簡單又有效的法子是値得介紹的。</p>
<h3>注意公瞏草地</h3>
<p>— 許晚成</p>
<p>近來各公園草地，因植草關係，禁止行走，掛出牌子「草地不准行走」，幷用繩攔好。國人對於公德，索不注意，用粗繩攔好，而又有「草地不准行走」示牌，仍有破壞「園規」，中國警察勸導，反而不聽，致被外國人打耳光，言之痛心，尙望遊客今後自重爲要。</p>
<h3>各界援助周敎師</h3>
<p>昨日本報載小學敎師咯血求援一文後，各界熱心人士紛紛來函同情，並助醫藥費，計（一）同舟食品社腹果製造家陳重遠君助五百元。（陳君近籌組小教產銷經濟信用合作社，造福小敎人員。）（二）申報一讀者贈送醫學博士周壽祥主辦之康健保障診療所會員證一紙，憑診免費治療一年。（三）遠東小學師生二百五十七元，（四）密波第一小學四六兩級學生二百元，（五）野田銀行無名氏一百元，（六）名隱先生五十元，（七）馬駿敬君二十元，（八）晏仁居士無名氏各十元，共一千一百四十七元，均當轉交周君，並代謝謝。又虹橋路上海平民肺病醫院來函，願收容周君，醫藥全免，僅付膳食。一併誌謝</p>

<p>經濟界　譯論</p>
<h3>如何調整商統會組織</h3>
<p>組織商統會下層機構之主要商品同業公會，及同業聯合會，進行頗見活潑。五十家同業公會，其中已有棉花等十種公會成立，十八日復經市府發表十六種同業公會之實業部指定發起人，聞今後將繼續由當局指派，因之商統會全面調整組織，更見其重要性，而爲各方所關心，今後如何調整商統機構使之强化，應注意决列各點：</p>
<p>（一）注重第二次組織工作　因新經濟政策有迅速實行之必要，故商統會之組織機構，自上而下，逐一組織（即由理監事會而聯合會，由聯合會而同業公會）但此項工作完畢後，第二步應實行自下而上之强化工作。商統會並非官治團體，應具有自治團體之性質，故必須重加調整機構，俾得上層機構充分吸收下部同業公會之意向。</p>
<p>（二）商統會與實糧兩部之關係　商統會當然受主管官署實業糧食兩部之指導監督，但此次整理同業公會，自上至下，指定發起人等事件，統由兩部直接指導，商統會本身殆不與此發生關係。爲加强今後統制起見，多方主張應即根據商統會本身之創意與責任，實行整理聯合會，同業公會，先山國府在租界財界人中選定理監事會，然後由下部同業公會用自主選舉方式再選，尤其是下部聯合會，同業公會等之理監事，須以同業者之純粹選舉方式再加決定。</p>
<p>（三）調整實糧兩部指導商統會之關係　按照主要商品之性質，商統會分別接受實業糧食兩部之指導，在主要商品之中，例如油同時兼具食料品與工業原料之兩種性質，類此之商品不少，頗易引起糧部與實部系統同業公會之摩擦，此則希望能重加合理調整。</p>
<p>（四）實業部與上海市經濟局之關係　實業部對於指定同業聯合會發起人等工作，大多由該部自行處理，公會之登記及其他事務，則着市政府經濟局辦理，經濟局與工部局之物資統制局保持聯絡，處理整理公會等事，此種過渡辦法之兩方監督，應速糾正，歸市政府經濟局統一監督。</p>
<p>（五）同業公會與聯合會之關係　自上而下順决組織之商統會下部機構及其聯合組織，更應自下而上再加確立，此爲各有力同業公會之意見。</p>
<p>（六）商統會與市商會之關係　具有悠久歷史之市商會，業已變成商業懇談會乃至商業社會團體之性格，並無與商統會併行而兩方指導衝突性，但一方面仍須明確規定市商會之今後工作重心，指導其實踐活動。</p>
<p>總之，確立商統會之組織，尙未竣事，欲根據自主與創意，確立足以發揮民族資本力量之眞正自主組織，尙有待於今後之努力。（雲鵬：譯自五月二十日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>糧食部主管　六業聯合會成立</h3>
<p>昨日（廿一日）下午四時，全國商統會理事長唐壽民，監事長聞蘭亭，爲糧食部主管六業聯合會組織成立，特於金門飯唐八樓開茶會歡迎，並敦請糧食部長顧寳衡氏，曁該部各處長·司長·局長蒞臨，首山唐理事長</p>
<p>致開會辭</p>
<p>大意謂糧食部主管六業聯合會，曁上海區六公會能於最短期問盡最大努力，促其實現者，要由顧部長及所屬各長官督導有方，表示感謝。繼謂六業關係民食前途至深且切，吾人應發揮統制精神，謀民食之安定。最後謂各業對於現行統制法規，如認爲有不適合商情者，只要不違反統制意義，儘可陳述理山，向政府建議。並希望各聯合會隨時注意勸導同業公會會員勿作投機囤秘行爲，致召物議等語。</p>
<p>顧部長辭</p>
<p>對於過去兩個月各業領補之精誠合作，獲得美滿效果，異常欣慰，並將此次統制機構變更情形加以說明，希望各業體會政府之意旨，不可將此决成立之同業公會及聯合會誤視爲許通之利益團體，應本國家經濟政府及商人自活精神，戮力爲國家民族及各木業前途造福，一面完遂大束亞戰爭之使命云云。糧部駐滬辦事處</p>
<p>紀處長辭</p>
<p>先說明各公會及聯合會成立經過，並闡述人民團體責任與任務今昔不同之點，演繹法意，允見精湛。嗣六業代表先後起立表示愛戴，願共同努力，以完成此艱巨之使命云。</p>
<h3>日方成立華中　肥皂統制會</h3>
<p>肥皂統制機構，原定中日聯合組織，頃因各種關係，故變更原定計劃，中日雙方各個成立統制機構，均歸商統會直轄。</p>
<p>日方肥皂業，遵照五月六日大使館當局之指示，解散過去之肥皂關係組合，決定籌組華中石鹼統制組合（華名：華中肥皂統制協會）推定日本油脂第一工業製藥，前田洋行上海油脂工業，三井洋行三菱商事，大丸洋行出光興產等八大行號爲籌備人，業已就緒，於十九日下午二時假日本俱樂部舉行創立大會，至此商統會內肥皂部份之日方下層機構，已吿成立。</p>
<p>創立大會時，到有大使館事務所德永商工課長（代表）全體行禮如儀後，推舉主席，報吿籌備經過，審議章程，選舉理監事，旋由理事長致辭，德永商工課長（代表）致訓示，語多勉勵。</p>
<p>該組合以在華中有營業部或辦事處之肥皂製造業及有力經銷肥皂商組織，內部機構分生產。配給兩部，在大使館事務所指導監督之下，調整肥皂供應，計劃實施生產配給，設法採辦原料，規定售價等事。該組合之正副理事長及理監事如次：</p>
<p>理事長日本油脂持田由考，副理事長三菱商事，會計理事大丸洋行，理事第一工業製藥，前田洋行，上海油脂，三井洋行，出光興產，監事榮泰洋行，久幸洋行。衆認華方之皂業機構，雖未能同時實現，但相信不久當亦能成立。（雲鵬：譯自五月二十一日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>華股趨勢</h3>
<p>昨華股大部份仍在虛軟情勢中下挫。蓋旣受銀根支配，且在跌勢中新老投資者暫懷覜望也。成交不旺，惟大中華火柴新股異幟獨舉，續在搜求下上升。南洋烟草公司交稀價奉，百貨業最爲疲軟，永安。新新。國貨公司，均見軋小，永安紗廠賣勢未退，美亞亦疲。新藥業中法藥房呆平，新亞藥廠小挫。閘北水電。華商電氣俱見軟化。文化業中華書局獨平，商務·世界略見低落。久安實業與新益地產少變化，新股通易信託與景福襪衫廠在搜求中堅定。</p>
<h3>簡訉</h3>
<p>保康化學製藥廠般份有限公司，係由吳蘊齊江玉山等所發起，籌備迄今已歷平載，資本如數收足。茲定於本月二十二日下午二時假座廣西路福來飯店召開創立會。設辦事處於南成都路一二九弄四號。</p>

<h3>The Contradictory Phenomena of Wartime Life: A Contrast Between Factories and Dance Halls</h3>
<p>Wartime life, especially in a global war during its decisive phase, demands that the entire nation's strength be concentrated and dedicated to the country. The so-called main content of wartime life, on the one hand, requires that people of all strata endure inconveniences and hardships as much as possible, reduce their standard of living as much as possible, in order to conserve manpower and materials, contribute to the country, and strive for victory in the war. On the other hand, it requires the people to concentrate all their minds and labor on production, demanding that every minute of time and every ounce of strength achieve considerable results to aid in the victory of the war. The state implements general mobilization and various control plans, and the people all encourage themselves with the so-called "patriotism and public service" and "total participation in the war," all for this purpose. Every modern military strategist firmly states that the final deciding force in the current war lies not only in the fighting at the front, but even more in the concentration of all forces in the rear in the war machine, which is the thoroughness of the people's wartime life. The nation whose people's wartime life is most thorough can stand in an invincible position and strive for victory in the decisive battle. Ask which of the countries currently in a superior position in the war is not due to the seriousness and tension of the lives of the people in the rear, saving on waste, and increasing production?</p>
<p>Since the National Government entered the war, Shanghai has been a wartime city, and every citizen should have the responsibilities and obligations of war, and every citizen should practice wartime life. However, what we actually see is completely different. We do not see any wartime scenes or wartime spirit; perhaps it is the complete opposite. The most obvious example is dancing. There is morning dancing, noon dancing, afternoon tea dancing, and evening night dancing. Clear singing and graceful dancing often do not stop until late at night, and there are even all-night sessions, with morning dances starting up immediately afterward. This kind of non-waste of a minute of time and spirit can be said to be extreme. If dancing were a productive endeavor rather than a consumptive and wasteful activity, then we believe that Shanghai would not have to worry about a shortage of supplies or fluctuating prices, and the effect of the nation's participation in the war would be even more significant. What is lamentable is not production, but dancing, but dancing that consumes resources, wastes energy, and numbs people's minds!</p>
<p>Conversely, let us look at the factories engaged in production. In the past, there were day shifts and night shifts. In wartime, all countries have abolished the morning and afternoon system and adopted a continuous work system, working day and night, engaging in production, not letting the enemy catch up even for a minute or a second. But today in Shanghai, with a very few exceptions, night shifts have long been suspended, and day shifts are also sometimes on and sometimes off, opening every other day, opening every three days, and even long-term shutdowns are everywhere. How shall we explain this absolutely contradictory phenomenon of wartime life? However, such contradictory phenomena are probably not limited to the contrast between dance halls and factories!</p>
<p>We have specifically cited the two matters of factories and dance halls to make a comparison, to illustrate that the lives of some of the people at present not only have no meaning of wartime life, but are simply running in the opposite direction, more unreasonable than peacetime life. Because in peacetime, it is already necessary to pay attention to increasing production and developing industry, so peacetime factories have already implemented a system of continuous day and night shifts. Then, in wartime, it is even more necessary to strengthen production efficiency. Logically, there should be more work shifts than in peacetime, or at least maintain the work shifts of peacetime. However, the current reality is that the number of work shifts is specifically reduced. Although we also understand the environmental factors such as the limitations of electricity and the lack of raw materials. However, we must ask: In the economic principles of a nation at war, is it ultimately to increase production or to reduce production? If it is said that increasing production is "a matter of course," and is clearly stipulated in the outline of wartime economic policy, then why not think of ways to eliminate the so-called environmental factors? The industrial world is not without people with foresight,</p>
<p>In short, we always believe that supporting production and promoting increased production is the primary point of practicing wartime life. If factors hindering production are discovered, no matter how difficult they may be, they must be resolutely eliminated. For example, in the case of electricity restrictions, it is necessary to negotiate for the supply of coal. (Here, attention should be paid to the comparison between the electricity consumption of dining and entertainment venues and the electricity consumption of factories.) If the lack of raw materials is due to agricultural producers, then it is necessary to promote planting; if it is due to transportation delays, then it is necessary to negotiate for dredging. (Here, attention must also be paid to whether factories and other hoarders are hoarding raw materials.) If one side shouts about how to increase production, while the other side watches the causes hindering production and waits for it to improve naturally, that will never be realized. We sincerely hope that the government will pay close attention to the causes hindering production and adjust the contradictory phenomena that are inconsistent with wartime life. At the same time, factories engaged in production should also unite, establish close contact with the government, and work together to solve the causes hindering production. As the saying goes, "Things are done by people." The industrial world is not without people with foresight, whether it is for the sake of developing their own business, for the sake of revitalizing the national industry, for the sake of increasing production, enriching wartime materials, stabilizing people's livelihoods, or striving for victory in the war, they should all take the initiative to rise up, advise the government, and cooperate with the government, in order to achieve the goal of increasing production.</p>
<h3>The Russo-Japanese War: Records from This Newspaper Thirty-Eight Years Ago, Re-copied from Old Newspapers (2)</h3>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>We recognize that defending the Pacific in the future will be entirely the responsibility of Asians, and that the intrusion of British and American aggressive forces will no longer be tolerated. However, fulfilling the task of defense depends on a strong naval power. Our friendly neighbor, Japan, has established its navy through decades of hard work and continuous improvement. In the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago, it defeated the many with the few, showing its first signs of prowess. In this Great East Asia War, it has further demonstrated its invincible power. At present, the entire defense of the Pacific is solely shouldered by the navy of our friendly neighbor, and we are deeply ashamed that we have not been able to share the burden even slightly. Therefore, how we will learn from the navy of our friendly neighbor as a model, establish a new Chinese navy, and participate in the task of defending the Pacific is truly a goal that our countrymen should strive to catch up with urgently. In order to increase the naval knowledge and interest of our countrymen, this newspaper has specially excerpted from its records of the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago, to be re-copied, from the 20th to the 30th, for a period of ten days, and we hope that readers will pay attention.</p>
<h3>A Discussion of How the Russo-Japanese War Relates to the Overall Situation in Asia</h3>
<p>(Published in this newspaper, No. 11080, the ninth day of the first month of Guangxu 30th year, Western calendar February 24, 1904, Wednesday)</p>
<p>What is the relationship between the rise and fall of the Russo-Japanese War? Since the beginning of the world, for tens of thousands of years, Asia has been located in the Eastern Hemisphere, surrounded by the sea in the southeast and limited by the desert in the northwest, closing itself off and never interacting with other continents. Since Europeans invented the manufacture of wheeled boats and wheeled vehicles, they have made the vast ocean seem like a grain of rice, and viewed thousands of miles as if they were in their own courtyard. Thus, the five continents have become connected, opening up a strange situation unprecedented in ancient times. The monarchs of various countries know each other, and the interactions between countries have become frequent. A peaceful situation cannot be constantly relied upon, and the beginnings of war cannot be avoided by chance. Therefore, alliances are established to protect them, and public laws are set up to define them, so that they do not turn jade and silk into weapons of war, and so that countries and people are not trampled upon. However, once interactions are established, it is easy for disputes to arise. Small disputes are of course no matter, but in the last hundred years, the various countries of Europe and America, such as the Russo-French War, the Franco-German War, the Anglo-French War, and the wars in North and South America, have all been plagued by continuous battles that have lasted for several years, wasting tens of millions in military expenditure and injuring hundreds of millions of people. Only after the numbers of victory and defeat have been determined do they each return to good terms and seek out alliances again. However, these are all matters that have taken place in Europe and America, and have not involved Asia. The only war that has taken place in Asian territory is the Russo-Turkish War, which is somewhat noteworthy. The rest, such as the wars between Britain, France, Japan, and China, have been short-lived, immediately returning to amicable relations after seeing each other in military attire. Although it is said that there are events on the borders, it is not enough to call it war. Only the current Russo-Japanese War, although Russia is located in Western Europe, has gained momentum to sweep across Asia since the construction of the Siberian Railway. Although Japan is an island nation in East Asia, it has also had the ambition to dominate Asia since it defeated China, refurbished its armor, purchased ships and warships, and made long voyages. Since two heroes cannot stand side by side, the outbreak of war was long expected. This time, it has indeed started a war over the three eastern provinces of China and Korea, fighting once at [missing text] and again at Lushun. According to Japanese newspaper reports, victories have been reported one after another, while Russia has suffered many losses. However, news of military affairs is constantly changing. If the Russians are defeated and return, the ambitious and heroic Russian Emperor will not be willing to give in easily because of occasional setbacks. According to the reports, the Russian Emperor is mobilizing 500,000 troops, who will rush to Liaodong by rail. Within a month, they can be deployed, and their persistent spirit is enough to intimidate people. Although Japan's terrain is not as deep and solid as Russia's, and its spirit is not as deep and heroic as Russia's, its monarch and subjects are united, advancing bravely without looking back, and its intelligence is exceptionally clever. Its reconnaissance is thorough everywhere, taking risks and surprising people. These are its strengths. Even if it suffers setbacks in the future, it will continue to fight, and its vigor will never diminish slightly. At the beginning of this war, it is said that the deer chases in the Central Plains, but no one knows who will die. From a superficial point of view, the division of victory and defeat between Japan and Russia is related to the safety of Asia. In the past, when the Russian fleet wanted to exit the Black Sea, it was blocked by various countries, so it changed its course to the east. The reason why various countries do not allow it to exit the Black Sea is not only to fear it, but also to fear it. Now that it has extended its power to East Asia, if it returns in triumph one day, not only will the three eastern provinces of China be under Russian control, but even Korea will be annexed into Russian territory. At this point, Japan's defenses will be completely dismantled, and the isolated island of East Sea will be in danger. And China, which is being choked and throttled, is even more irrelevant.</p>

<p>Navy Minister Shimada Explains His Determination</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) Japanese Navy Minister Shimada gave a statement at 5:00 PM on the 21st regarding the heroic death of Fleet Admiral Yamamoto, stating in essence: "Since the battle of Hawaii and the Malayan seas, which shocked the world, our Navy has been conducting large-scale operations throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, defeating resistance in various places and achieving brilliant victories. It has been only a year and a half since then, and the foundation for inevitable victory has been laid, thanks to the grace of His Majesty the Emperor. At the same time, the Combined Fleet and the Army have closely assisted each other, implementing thorough operations and fleet leadership, and fully exerting their strength. Marshal Yamamoto's special actions can be recorded in history and will be immortal. Since the beginning of the war, Marshal Yamamoto has personally commanded operations on the front lines, achieving great victories. Now, unfortunately, he has heroically sacrificed himself on the front lines. The bad news has shocked and moved the whole country, and the will to kill the enemy has been further strengthened. The current war situation is becoming more and more important and is the time to determine the rise and fall of our country. Marshal Yamamoto's sacrifice is undoubtedly a great regret, but our Navy has not been shaken in the slightest by this. Under His Majesty's grace, with ever-increasing morale, we will consolidate our determination to kill the enemy and continue to fight to put His Majesty at ease."</p>
<p>Minister Lin Xuan's Statement</p>
<p>Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) On the afternoon of the 21st, Minister of Propaganda Lin, speaking to reporters in strong terms about the news of the heroic death of Admiral Yamamoto, said: "Admiral Yamamoto, with his most heroic spirit, most flexible strategy, and most tenacious spirit, repeatedly established special achievements and laid the foundation for victory in the Great East Asia War. All East Asians sincerely admire him. This time, he personally went to the front lines and died heroically, which is enough to make people respect him after mourning. This is truly a model of the spirit of the friendly navy. Admiral Yamamoto's blood will forever be the cornerstone for consolidating the Great Wall of East Asia. After Admiral Yamamoto's death, Admiral Koga took over, and the front line is becoming stronger and more active, which is enough to show that the decisive stage of the Great East Asia War has an absolute chance of success. The United States is now disagreeing with Britain and the Soviet Union on the issue of the second front. The light and heavy priorities between Britain and the Soviet Union are different, and the United States is deeply worried about the South Pacific. This kind of dispute exposes the differences in dreams and plans among the so-called anti-Axis countries. On the one hand, it is enough to prove that the United States is in danger and cannot spare any effort to relieve Britain and the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, it admits that it can no longer support the South Pacific war situation alone."</p>
<p>Navy Minister Ren Mourns Admiral Yamamoto</p>
<p>Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) Navy Minister Admiral Ren Yuandao issued a brief statement as follows: "Since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, the friendly navy has created great results with a conviction of death, which is the glory of the East Asian nations. This time, Admiral Yamamoto died in battle to defend East Asia, and we express our infinite respect for him. Admiral Yamamoto has become the god of the East Asian navy. We admire his great achievements and should complete his unfinished ambition and strive to complete the war. During the admiral's lifetime, I had the opportunity to admire his many decisions, and his great demeanor is still deeply imprinted in my mind. As for the successor, Admiral Koga, I was even closer to him when he was the Commander of the Chinese Navy. The admiral is a genius with strategic talent. From now on, he will annihilate the British and American navies, making the Pacific Ocean a solid fortress that can be easily won."</p>

<h3>"Remembering Marshal Yamamoto" Radio Broadcast by Director Yano, Overcome with Emotion</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - Following the news of the heroic death of Marshal Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet, the entire nation of Japan mourned. Major General Hideo Yano, Director of the Naval Press Department of the Imperial Headquarters, broadcast on Tokyo Radio Station at 7:30 PM on the 21st, a program titled "Remembering Marshal Yamamoto," which lasted for fifteen minutes. During the broadcast, Major General Yano was overcome with emotion, his sorrow deeply moving. The gist of his speech was: "Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, Marshal Yamamoto, has heroically died on the front lines of the South Pacific. In addition to my profound condolences, I am deeply moved when recalling Marshal Yamamoto's illustrious military achievements and his heroic spirit. After graduating from the Naval Academy in the 37th year of Meiji, Marshal Yamamoto served in the military for forty years. During this time, as a naval ensign, he participated in the Battle of the Sea of Japan, sustaining serious injuries and establishing his initial meritorious service. Subsequently, he participated in World War I and several decisive battles, establishing brilliant military achievements. Later, as commander of an aviation squadron, he enlightened the importance of the naval air force and devoted himself to its construction. At the same time, as a plenipotentiary committee member and representative, he attended the Washington Naval Disarmament Conference, consistently advocating for our country's positions. After returning to Japan, he assumed the important post of Director of the Naval Aviation Headquarters, establishing our country's present-day naval aviation. He then became a naval commander, navigating the complexities of international affairs, diligently working for national affairs. In the 14th year of Showa, he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, participating in the Sino-Japanese War, demonstrating the spirit and strength of land-sea cooperation, forcing the Chongqing government to retreat inland. At the same time, he devoted himself to strengthening our forces and establishing sure-win strategies to cope with the Greater East Asia War. I still remember on December 8, Showa 16, when our country declared war on Britain and the United States, our navy immediately annihilated the main force of the British and American Pacific Fleets, instantly reducing their naval power. Since then, with lightning speed, we have attacked and defeated stubborn enemies everywhere, destroying the enemy's self-proclaimed encirclement, and conducting large-scale operations in the Indian Ocean, the South Pacific, and the East Pacific. We also dispatched a part of the navy to attack the west coast of the American mainland and various places in Australia and South Africa, reaping glorious victories. Although only a year and a half has passed since the start of the war, our country has already built solid strongholds around us, established an absolutely superior strategy, and laid the foundation for final victory. These rare and great achievements are due to the Combined Fleet's meticulous operations and effective command. The accomplishments of its supreme commander, Marshal Yamamoto, are worthy of being recorded in history and will be forever immortalized. This time, His Majesty the Emperor, to commend his special merits, personally visited Marshal Yamamoto's residence and bestowed upon him the title of Marshal and posthumously awarded him the First Class Order of the Golden Kite, truly the highest honor for a warrior. Since August of last year, Marshal Yamamoto has repeatedly personally commanded operations on the front lines where the fighting was fiercest, demonstrating an extraordinary fighting spirit. At the same time, all officers and soldiers were deeply moved, vowing to fight to the death to kill the enemy. When Marshal Yamamoto heroically died, that area was engaged in fierce air battles day and night. Marshal Yamamoto personally went to the front lines of this fierce battle to guide the overall operation and engage the enemy, and finally died heroically in the plane. His heroic and valiant spirit is sufficient to be an eternal model for all officers and soldiers of the Japanese Navy. I firmly believe that this will be a driving force to destroy the United States and Britain. From before the start of the war until the early stages of the war, I served as the captain of the Combined Fleet flagship, and thus had the opportunity to serve Marshal Yamamoto day and night. The personality of Marshal Yamamoto, deeply imprinted in my mind, can be described as both resolute and steady, and magnanimous and broad-minded. In his strong physique and dignified demeanor, he also possessed the warmth of a benevolent father and the breadth of mind of the sea. He truly deserved to be a perfect leader, inspiring awe and respect. Especially as the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, shouldering the heavy responsibility of our country's rise and fall, his state of mind before and after receiving the Emperor's edict to destroy the United States and Britain was beyond anyone's comprehension. At that time, Marshal Yamamoto's attitude was calm and unhurried, and his composure inspired the officers and soldiers of the Combined Fleet with boundless trust and inspiration. When Commander Yamamoto gathered the commanding officers of the Combined Fleet at the start of the war, he said: 'I hope that you will share life and death with me.' I still remember Commander Yamamoto's words, which were as firm as a rock and as divine as a god. I will never forget them for the rest of my life. When the war situation became increasingly serious, and we received the shocking news of Marshal's death, all officers and soldiers were deeply saddened. However, the Imperial Navy not only stands firm and unwavering, but will also follow Marshal's heroic spirit, united in hatred of the enemy, and advance towards the destruction of the United States and Britain. I firmly believe that the people of our nation will inherit Marshal's heroic and lofty spirit, and that this will happen in the days to come."</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Hunan Province Secure First-Line Positions; Successful Mechanized Warfare in Mountainous Areas</h3>
<p>Hankou, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from the front lines on the 21st, the Japanese army's annihilation battle against five divisions of the Chongqing army in the area west of Gong'an concluded on the 18th after achieving great results. The main force of the Chongqing (Tenth Army Group) has been completely annihilated, and the remnants of the (Eighty-Seventh Army) are still wandering in the area north of Wenshui Street. This glorious victory was obtained through the skillful three-dimensional operations of the Japanese upper echelons and air force, as well as the valiant struggle of the Japanese soldiers. In particular, the success of the Japanese army's mechanized warfare in the mountainous areas is a hallmark of this operation. After the Japanese army began its operations at midnight on the 12th, it took only three days for the southern and northern forces to make contact north of Xiqi, a speed that stunned the Chongqing army. Although the commander of the Eighty-Seventh Army, Gao Zhuodong, and the commander of the Ninety-Fourth Army, Mou Tingfang, ordered their subordinates to defend to the death, they themselves fled in plain clothes. Thus, in less than twenty days since the start of the annihilation battle on the shores of Dongting Lake, the Japanese army has annihilated the main force of the Chongqing (Sixth War Zone)'s Nineteenth and Tenth Army Groups, totaling nine divisions with 90,000 soldiers, in the mountains and fields of Jiangnan, and has now secured the first-line positions stretching 200 kilometers along Anxiang, Nanxian, and Zhijiang.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - A certain person here stated: The spokesman for the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission previously made a distorted explanation on the 28th night regarding the participation of Generals Pang Bingxun and Sun Dianying in the peace movement, in an attempt to cover up the facts. However, the truth of the matter will be proven by the facts themselves. Furthermore, Pang, having recognized the situation in East Asia and believing that peace is the only way to revive China, resolutely participated in the peace movement. This situation will further shatter Chongqing's malicious propaganda. Furthermore, regarding the matter of 70,000 soldiers defecting, the truth or falsehood of the matter can be clearly understood.</p>
<h3>United States Rescinds Immigration Act for Chongqing</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) - Since its defeat in the Pacific, the United States has been chanting the slogan of counter-offensive, in order to ease the domestic atmosphere. Thus, it is doing its best to use Chongqing's Chiang to contain Japan, and has recently taken so-called measures such as abolishing extraterritoriality for Chongqing as bait. A few days ago, it also proposed to abolish the Chinese Exclusion Act in a meeting. This move is merely a habitual trick to appease Chongqing's Chiang. We are well aware of the various despicable and vicious methods used by the British and Americans against people of color in the past, which are clearly visible to all and cannot be concealed. Even the oppression and bullying of overseas Chinese in the United States is hair-raising to speak of. Therefore, when the people of our country hear of the so-called abolition of the immigration law by the United States this time, they can all see through its treachery and will not be deceived by its tricks. On the contrary, they will recognize its consistent cunning methods, which will only see its efforts be in vain.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - It has recently been reported that American congressmen have proposed to abolish the Chinese Exclusion Act in Congress. Overseas Chinese in Japan, upon hearing this, will hold a four-day All-Japan Overseas Chinese Conference in Kobe starting from the 16th, and will appeal to overseas Chinese in the United States and compatriots in Chongqing not to be confused by Anglo-American schemes, and to awaken to the concept of shared destiny and mutual survival between China and Japan, and the revitalization of East Asia.</p>

<h3>Italian Aircraft Attack Enemy Convoy off the Coast of Algeria; Berlin Announced Battle Results in North Africa Last Night; Over 300,000 Casualties for Anti-Axis Forces</h3>
<p>Rome, 21st (Central News Agency) - The Italian Military Headquarters announced yesterday afternoon: The Italian Air Force has attacked enemy convoys off the coast of Algeria for several days. On the 19th, it sank two medium-sized ships with torpedoes and seriously damaged a 10,000-ton ship. In addition, Axis aircraft also raided the three military ports of Aranci, Jijel, and Skikda, achieving considerable results.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to news received here last night, anti-Axis authorities in Tunisia have arrested more than 1,000 people. Algiers Radio announced: Anti-Axis authorities are still searching for "traitors, Axis collaborators, and enemy personnel."</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) - It was announced here last night: The Axis forces' valiant resistance in Tunisia for half a year resulted in the loss of over 370,000 British and American invaders, including 25 generals. Although the anti-Axis forces in Tunisia were greatly superior in manpower and material resources, they were still captured by the German army, including 120,000 people and 18 generals. The anti-Axis fatalities exceeded 50,000, including 7 generals. The anti-Axis wounded totaled approximately 200,000. In the non-warfare phase in Africa, 7,337 anti-Axis tanks were lost to the German army. During the course of the war, the actual strength of the German army in North Africa could not be announced. In fact, six months ago, the German army landed in Tunisia with only 238 paratroopers and infantrymen to establish a safe bridgehead in preparation for the subsequent arrival of the German army. At that time, the French army's attitude was ambiguous, and the anti-Axis tank forces were also approaching. The success of this great undertaking was due to the German army's capture of large quantities of military supplies from the anti-Axis forces. For example, in El Guettar, seven German tanks captured 2,000 anti-Axis motorcycles and captured 2,000 people. The German army relied on these vehicles and the fuel captured at the same time to advance. As for Marshal Rommel's attack on El Alamein in the summer of 1942, it was so fierce because the Axis forces had captured almost all of the British Eighth Army's vehicles, as well as enough fuel for three months, as well as large artillery and heavy weapons. During the two and a half years of fighting in North Africa, the German army supplemented 80% of its transport vehicles, 40% of its weapons and ammunition, 50% of its tanks, and 30% of its fuel with spoils captured from the anti-Axis forces.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) - Washington dispatches received here today indicate that diplomatic figures in Washington all believe that Stalin will attend the next meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill to discuss global strategy. If President Roosevelt has no guarantee regarding efforts to invite Stalin to attend, Churchill would not dare to repeatedly express this wish in his speech in the United States, because the failure of such a meeting would only cause trouble for all parties involved.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Ottawa, Canadian Defense Minister Ralston, accompanied by three officers, departed from Ottawa for Washington to participate in the Washington conference.</p>
<h3>Stalin Received Davies the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>Ankara, 21st (Central News Agency) - Moscow Radio announced: Stalin received President Roosevelt's special envoy, Davies, in the Kremlin last night. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and US Ambassador General Standley were also present.</p>
<p>Moscow, 21st (Central News Agency) - US Presidential Envoy Davies visited Soviet Foreign People's Commissar Molotov on the 20th and held talks. When he met with reporters beforehand, he said: I was sent here only as an envoy, so I am completely unaware of the contents of President Roosevelt's personal letter to Chairman Stalin. It is expected that he will return to Washington after receiving Chairman Stalin's reply.</p>
<p>Geneva, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to a German news agency citing London news, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov arrived in Tehran on Thursday and is heading to Moscow.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Bomb Port Moresby; US Navy Admits Bases on Two Islands Were Bombed; Japanese Air Force Has Advantage in Southwest Pacific</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Melbourne, the anti-Axis headquarters in the Southwest Pacific announced on the 21st that Japanese air forces heavily bombed Port Moresby on the night of the 20th.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) - Washington dispatch: Yesterday's US Navy bulletin admitted that Japanese aircraft bombed US military bases on the islands of Guadalcanal and Russell again on the evening of May 18.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to news from Washington, Colonel Smith, Chief of Staff of the US Fifth Air Force and Commander of the New Guinea Air Force, stated: The Japanese Air Force in the Southwest Pacific has a two-to-one advantage compared to the anti-Axis Air Force in that area. The Japanese Air Force in New Britain has also doubled in the past five months.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Concentrates Heavy Troops South of Moscow</h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Eastern Front by German News Agency military correspondent Colonel Hammer, the Soviet Union is continuing to concentrate heavy troops south of Moscow. It is reported that in the area of Kursk, the Soviet Union is working hard to concentrate infantry and tank divisions. In addition, artillery units are also being concentrated. It seems that the Soviet Union has completed its preparations for the summer offensive, because the German army is pressing very hard on the Orel front, which will endanger Moscow, so the Soviet army will soon implement a counter-offensive plan.</p>
<h3>Differences in Tactical Thinking Between Japanese and British Navies (2)</h3>
<p>— Masanori Ito</p>
<p>(6) The So-Called "Annihilation" by Japanese Admirals</p>
<p>Japanese admirals not only want to start battles early, but also, based on the demands of the operational plan, which is the foundation of tactics, they mainly decide to implement deployments with the aim of first cutting off the enemy's retreat. However, sometimes they will rapidly deploy to the southwest, and continue south, encircling the enemy from the rear in a combat formation. Therefore, a right-flank deployment at 5:55 is best, and a right-flank deployment at 6:07 (when the position and direction of the German main force can be slightly discerned) is decisive. At 5:55, the enemy ships had not yet been seen, and there was a lot of sea haze, so the admiral who was worried about torpedo attacks would have felt some hesitation. However, if the goal is to annihilate the enemy, there should be absolutely no hesitation.</p>
<p>Please look at Marshal Togo of the Japanese Sea! Please look at Chief of Staff Kato! What strategy did Admiral Togo use to face the sea battle? As most readers know, it was "annihilation." The United States Navy also likes this word, and uses the word "Annihilation" to define the tactical objective. But they only know how to talk about it on paper. Marshal Togo actually demonstrated this word in the Sea of Japan. The problem comes down to what to pay the price of "annihilation" with.</p>
<p>Marshal Togo was prepared to sacrifice most of our fleet to achieve this. This is the most important determination for a general facing a decisive battle. The word "wisdom and courage" can be said to exist to describe the attitude of a general in this situation. The wisdom to defeat the enemy also requires many excellent staff officers, but the tactic of "being able to sacrifice most of our fleet" is a decision that only the general can make alone. The commander is solely responsible for all losses. So he commands the entire army on the premise of judging how much sacrifice is acceptable.</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief Togo Heihachiro, although he did not explicitly state the number of battleships to be sacrificed from the six capital ships, or the number of pre-dreadnought battleships (armored cruisers) from the six, it was certain that he would resolutely complete the goal of "annihilation," even if it meant a great sacrifice.</p>
<p>(Note) Regarding this matter, when the author met with Prime Minister Kato Tomosaburo (Chief of Staff during the Battle of Tsushima) who was recuperating in Yugawara in May 1923, I personally heard him explain that the two right-angle turns, which were the central tactics of that naval battle, were the naval battle strategy understood between Togo and Kato.</p>
<p>(7) No Risk, No Victory</p>
<p>Simple victory was not in Admiral Togo's eyes. He only had "annihilation." In the famous first naval battle report drafted by staff officer Akiyama Saneyuki (submitted to the Imperial General Headquarters, presented just before the naval battle), there is the sentence "The Combined Fleet will immediately sortie to annihilate it." This "annihilation" became the slogan in the headquarters of the flagship Mikasa, so Akiyama did not exaggerate much, but just recorded it. At that time, the word "extermination" was hardly used. "Annihilation" was being used in the same sense as a thorough and great victory, representing the great undertaking of a complete victory in a rare decisive battle. The sentence "To annihilate" was what aroused the martial spirit of 60 million citizens.</p>
<p>However, in order to annihilate, one's own side would also be sunk considerably. But if one worries about this, one cannot annihilate. One can only achieve a simple victory. If that is the case, then one can draw the conclusion that the Battle of Tsushima was a failure. — This was within Admiral Togo's expectations. To completely destroy the enemy fleet without losing one's own fleet is an extremely dangerous tactical idea, and will inevitably lead to losing the war. Sacrificing half of oneself to kill all of the enemy is the essence of a decisive battle, a tactical theory already established on the table. Implementing this tactic is limited to famous generals. If one sacrifices half of oneself and cannot defeat the enemy, it is a defeat. Believing in victory, believing in the tactics of victory, measuring the battle results and deploying troops to the battlefield is the virtue of a famous general. There is bound to be a certain degree of risk, and there will be considerable damage. Without the courage to take risks for victory and to accept damage for the overall situation, one cannot conduct a great decisive battle. Therefore, Admiral Togo was able to fight a decisive battle in the Sea of Japan, while Jellicoe could not fight a decisive battle in the Battle of Jutland.</p>
<p>Regarding the point of sacrifice, ordinary soldiers, let alone those who are ignorant of war, find it difficult to grasp the correct concept. When defeating the enemy, they immediately worry about their own losses. This is fine, but desires gradually increase, hoping to defeat the enemy without any losses, and soon this becomes what Schelieffen called the "cherished concept," mistaking victory as the norm. In this way, one can never achieve a great victory. This must be guarded against.</p>
<p>(8) Admiral Togo's Two Right-Angle Turns</p>
<p>Even if he suffered extremely great sacrifices, Admiral Togo's goal was to not let a single enemy ship escape. The few small warships that slipped through were due to unavoidable circumstances, but all of the excellent ship types below the capital ships had to be sunk. Admiral Togo went to the battlefield with such strategic objectives and determination. What had to be sunk was not the number of enemy ships, but all of the enemy ships. Jellicoe was different. His strategic objective was to drive the German fleet back to German ports. In other words, Jellicoe's first goal was to suppress the North Sea activities by blockading the German fleet, and the second goal was to inflict damage during engagements. His tactical thinking will be mentioned later, but the aforementioned objectives are completely opposite to Admiral Togo's goal of not letting a single enemy ship escape.</p>
<p>Therefore, Jellicoe's combat deployment prioritized safety as an absolute condition, trying not to be hit by a single German shell or torpedo. At 6:15 PM, this right-flank deployment (1) also involved engaging early, and (2) was a method of cutting off the enemy's retreat; however, Jellicoe deployed to the left, avoiding immediate contact with the enemy, and adopting a tactic of gradually pressing in from a distance, further delaying the time of engagement.</p>
<p>(Note) Beatty, Thomas, and Vice Admiral Burney of the right wing squadron, all expected a right-flank deployment before this moment.</p>
<p>Admiral Togo's famous two right-angle turns were exactly opposite to Jellicoe's on the diagonal. This is the natural result of the difference between the strategic objectives and tactical thinking mentioned above. However, this point alone is not enough to explain the deployment of the Japanese admiral. Even the simplest explanation requires the line, "A great determination to prepare one's own state of decisive battle while allowing the enemy to fire freely." This is what allowed the fleet sailing southwest to completely turn to the northeast in front of the enemy at 8,000 meters, to present a parallel battle formation. Our battleships, led by the flagship Mikasa, turned around a circle following the same course, with the axis of rotation only being a point. If the enemy concentrated fire on this point, they would have gained a certain advantage in hitting. On the contrary, the enemy did not fire when we turned, so the disadvantage is very clear.</p>
<p>As expected, the Mikasa and the ships following it were hit by several shells early on. But Admiral Togo, who had embraced this determination from the beginning, did not care. The reason for adopting this posture was to resolutely implement a diagonal parallel engagement, suppressing the bows of the enemy ships, in the decisive battle to annihilate the enemy's main force. Taking a little attack at the beginning was not a problem at all for the purpose of annihilation. Such a danger was considered a matter of course. From this, one can understand the vast difference with Jellicoe's deployment. (Xiao: Translated from the May issue of Chuo Koron... to be continued)</p>

<h3>Concerning Relief for the North China Famine: All Sectors Initiate Donation Drives; Warm-Hearted People of Shanghai, Concerned for the Plight of Famine Victims, Entrust Their Family-Held Bronze and Stone Inscriptions, Books, and Paintings to This Newspaper for Charitable Sale</h3>
<p>Since news broke of the severity of the North China famine, people from all walks of life in this city have shown extraordinary concern, voluntarily offering assistance with great enthusiasm, and donating funds in large numbers in recent days. It is also heard that various trades in this city are currently initiating drives within their respective sectors to provide relief to North China refugees. Now, the culinary trade has begun soliciting donations in order to collect funds and entrust them to the Shanghai Office for North China Famine Relief. If trade associations can follow suit, raising a substantial sum should not be difficult.</p>
<p>Charitable Sale of Stone Classics</p>
<p>This newspaper received a letter yesterday from the master of the Stone Ink Building, which reads: "Respected Editor, calamities are bound to follow in the wake of war. The current disastrous famine in North China serves as proof. The words of the ancients have indeed been verified. I am but a salaried man. I came to Shanghai to escape conflict in the year of Wu Yin (1938), and have been unemployed for six years. I deeply regret my inability to donate due to my precarious existence. Having spent fifty years studying bronze and stone inscriptions, I have amassed tens of thousands of rubbings. Though half were lost in the aftermath of the incident (the war), rare editions and old Song and Ming rubbings still account for a tenth. These fleeting possessions, coupled with my declining years, make preservation difficult in these troubled times. It would be better to select items for charitable sale, using the proceeds to aid in famine relief, setting a precedent for collectors across the land. I am first selecting a complete set of the Ming-era rubbings of the Tang Kai Cheng Stone Classics, totaling thirteen cases with over one hundred and twenty individually mounted rubbings, all complete and without damage. (If calculated at the current mounting price, including the rubbings themselves, it would cost no less than 30,000 silver dollars. The purchaser will certainly not lose out.) It was formerly in the collection of Mr. Fei Qi'ao. In the early Republic, he acquired it from Chun Ming for 2,000 yuan. The world places great value on Song-era printed books, but the Stone Classics were carved in the Tang Dynasty, far earlier than the Song Dynasty. They are the most reliable source for textual research. Therefore, in his postscript to the bronze and stone inscriptions in the Baoshu Pavilion, Mr. Zhu Zhuting (Zhu Yizun) highly praises the Kai Cheng Stone Classics, considering them far superior to the Jiaoben edition. This indicates the value of this edition. I now propose to entrust it to your esteemed publication with a reserve price of 5,000 silver dollars. All proceeds will be used for famine relief. If you agree, please send someone to my humble abode at No. 136, Lane 608, Yuyuan Road to retrieve it. After this edition is sold, I plan to select one or two other rare editions for continued charitable sale, contributing a small stream to the flood of aid. From Chen Boheng, Master of the Stone Ink Building." Furthermore, Mr. Pu Qiting has submitted a Han jade belt hook, and Mr. Rong Baiyun has submitted two large calligraphy scrolls by famous individuals, entrusting them for charitable sale, with all proceeds to benefit North China drought relief.</p>
<p>The aforementioned items for charitable sale, such as the Ming-era rubbings of the Tang Kai Cheng Stone Classics, are all exceptionally rare and valuable. If you wish to purchase them, this newspaper will gladly liaise with the owners on your behalf.</p>
<p>Donation of Flour for Relief</p>
<p>On the 19th, Minister Ding of the Ministry of Social Welfare, together with Mayor Chen, hosted prominent figures from the industrial and commercial sectors of this city to solicit opinions on fundraising. Representatives specially dispatched by the North China Association in Beijing and Shanghai appealed for assistance and planned to establish the Shanghai Office for North China Emergency Relief. Yesterday, Mr. Cai Runsen, through fundraising in the names of the Pude Charity Society and Lande Xuan, donated a truckload of No. 4 flour, totaling 680 bags, which has been gratefully acknowledged in a special letter from the Shanghai Office.</p>

<h3>New Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani Masayuki, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday; Will Exchange Views with Chinese and Foreign Authorities and Inspect the Embassy Office</h3>
<p>Since assuming his post, the Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani Masayuki, has been extremely busy with diplomatic formalities. In order to exchange views with Chinese and foreign authorities in Shanghai and inspect the work of the Shanghai Japanese Embassy office, he arrived in Shanghai by train at 2:00 PM yesterday, accompanied by Minister Horiuchi, Secretary Shimizu, Secretary Terajima, Trustee Obata, and many others. Tani is expected to stay in Shanghai for three or four days before returning to Beijing.</p>
<p>Courtesies after Arrival in Shanghai</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, Ambassador Tani, accompanied by Minister Horiuchi and Secretary Shimizu, visited Admiral Yoshida, Commander of the Japanese Fleet in China, at 3:30 PM. Additionally, Councilor Ota, an aide to the ambassador, visited the Special Mayor of Shanghai, the Japanese Naval Attaché Office, the Minister of the Army, the Head of the Military Police, the Commander of the Special Naval Landing Force, and other parties on behalf of the ambassador. The ambassador received a return visit from Admiral Yoshida at his residence at 4:50 PM. At 7:00 PM, he attended a banquet hosted by Admiral Yoshida at the Naval Attaché's residence.</p>
<p>Remarks to Reporters</p>
<p>Ambassador Tani also met with reporters at his residence in the Broadway Mansions at 4:00 PM to express his sentiments upon assuming office. Regarding the forceful promotion of policies toward China and other current issues, he stated: "What I felt after arriving in Nanjing was that I was also in Nanjing five years ago, in the spring of the 27th year of the Republic (1938). At that time, it was not long after the fall of Nanjing, and there were few residents, and machine gun emplacements remained in various places. However, this time, in Nanjing, the former machine gun emplacements have been replaced by bronze statues of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. The bloody atmosphere of the past has been completely eliminated, and a peaceful atmosphere prevails. In particular, third countries and even hostile forces that alienated China and Japan have recently been completely eradicated. Because the Empire is implementing a new policy toward China, the mutual trust and understanding between China and Japan is deepening, which is extremely gratifying. Deepening the trust and understanding between China and Japan is the key to future policy toward China, and Japan will make every effort to promote it. Before my previous visit to Shanghai, the power of Britain and the United States was still very strong, and the Greater East Asia War had not yet broken out. Britain and the United States often thought of protecting their own interests and obstructing Japan's operations. During this period, I tried to smooth over friction with the rights of third countries. After this process, the people of China and Japan finally discovered the true path to cooperation and moved forward together in the right direction. The new policy toward China is not another new policy, but a policy that eliminates illegal forces and builds on true righteousness. Since the Opium War of 1842, Britain and the United States have obtained concessions and other rights as bases for aggression in East Asia. In order to eliminate these British and American forces, Japan must take measures to preserve East Asia, and first abolish extraterritoriality, return concessions, and implement other policies necessary to strengthen the new China. This is the natural result of implementing the spirit of national founding in which all nations are in their proper place. Therefore, this new policy may rather be called a restoration policy or a true policy. China and Japan should thoroughly understand this fact and eliminate enemy propaganda, needless to say. During the Greater East Asia War, the Empire achieved brilliant victories, and the north and south of East Asia have now completed an impregnable line of defense. The current war is not only a military war, but must be waged with the total strength of all countries and nations in order to achieve final victory. The National Government is also making every effort to complete this goal and cooperate with Japan to complete the war. The important measures currently being taken by the governments of China and Japan are to strengthen the political power of the National Government, revitalize the Chinese economy, and stabilize the people's livelihood. This is merely a concrete plan based on the spirit of promoting the policy toward China. We will continue to strongly promote the policy toward China and fully review all aspects of the situation necessary to make every effort to promote the new policy."</p>
<h3>Commemorating Navy Day: Begins Yesterday; Central News Agency to Hold China-Japan Naval Symposium Today</h3>
<p>The 27th of this month is the Japanese Navy Memorial Day. Various Chinese and Japanese public organizations in this city are celebrating this occasion by holding a grand series of commemorative activities for ten consecutive days, starting yesterday. Yesterday, eye-catching celebratory slogans and pictures were displayed in front of all movie theaters and company shops throughout the city, attracting the attention of passersby. The Shanghai branch of the Central News Agency will hold a China-Japan Naval Cooperation Symposium at the Cathay Hotel at 2:00 PM today. Colonel Kamada, Head of the Press Department of the Japanese Naval Fleet, Jiang Xiyuan, President of the Central Naval Academy, Huang Xun, Director of the Seamen Training Institute, and Tang Baohuang, Captain of the Haixing warship, have been invited to attend. It is expected that they will deliver great speeches and contribute to China-Japan naval cooperation.</p>
<h3>36th Period Household Rice Ration: Available for Purchase Starting Today</h3>
<p>The 665 designated rice shops in the International Settlement and the French Concession, as well as the rice distribution centers of each bureau, will simultaneously begin distributing the 36th period household rice ration today (the 22nd). Citizens with the 36th period coupon can purchase 1.5 sheng of white or brown rice and 0.5 sheng of broken rice for 6 yuan. Additionally, with the 36th period flour coupon, one jin of No. 2 flour can be purchased for 4.9 yuan. The rice ration period ends on the 30th; coupons will be invalid after this date.</p>
<p>First Phase of Coarse Grain Distribution in Western Shanghai</p>
<p>The first phase of coarse grain distribution of four packages in the first and second wards of Western Shanghai has been arranged by the district public sales office and will be distributed simultaneously by the 55 public sales outlets in the district starting yesterday. Each person can purchase one jin of broad beans with the district's eighth household flour coupon, priced at 1.9 yuan.</p>
<h3>Third Period Household Sugar: To Be Sold Within the Month; Prices Have Been Adjusted</h3>
<p>After the sugar merchant cooperative began implementing sugar distribution by household, the third period of household sugar was originally scheduled to be distributed by Category A retailers with sugar coupons starting May 11. However, due to adjustments in sugar prices, the implementation was postponed. It is now understood that the sugar price adjustment is being reviewed by the military distribution authorities. After approval, they will consult with the Public Works Bureau and the Food Administration Bureau before issuing a public announcement and officially implementing the distribution. It is likely that this will be realized within the month. The cooperative has instructed all Category A retailers to properly store their existing sugar and not to sell it without authorization. Retailers will be fully responsible for any shortages.</p>
<h3>Oil Shops Skimp on Weight: Users Report and Sue</h3>
<p>The Longtai Oil Shop at No. 291 Beishan West Road was found to be skimping on weight when selling household oil last Friday. Users Mr. Hu Sun, Mr. Zhu Kaiyong, and Mr. Lu Rongsheng discovered the discrepancy and reported it to the Huisi Police Station. Detective Wu Guang investigated and found that when the complainants went to buy oil, they had brought their own market scales. Mr. Hu Sun bought 13 jin and 8 liang of oil and was shorted 13.5 liang. Mr. Zhu Kaiyong bought 7 jin of oil and was shorted 8.5 liang. Mr. Lu Rongsheng bought 2 jin of oil and was shorted 2 liang. The shop assistant, Pu Amao from Nanxun, was arrested and sent to the First Special Court for questioning and detention. At the continued questioning yesterday morning, the police representative charged him with fraud, stating that because the price of cooking oil is high and the rationed quantity is insufficient, the accused skimped on weight, which is heinous and should be severely punished according to the law. Furthermore, the accused confessed at the police station that the shortage was on the orders of the shop owner, Wang Jimin, and the bookkeeper. Therefore, the police should detain Wang and the bookkeeper for questioning. The prosecutor requested a postponement, and Judge Peng ordered Pu Amao to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: Adds New Routes on the Lower Yangtze River; Ten Purchased Riverboats Have Been Incorporated into Schedules</h3>
<p>Since the restrictions on the transportation of goods have been eased, the transportation work of various shipping companies in this city has been busier than before. In order to meet this demand, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has not only added ships but also opened many new routes.</p>
<p>A Total of Ten Ships Added</p>
<p>Regarding the addition of ships, the company has recently purchased a total of ten ships, most of which were previously leased. They have now been incorporated into the schedules. Among them is one ship that was recently manufactured by the company, but it is currently under repair because it uses coal. It is estimated that these newly added ships will increase shipping capacity by thousands of tons. Some will be used to transport iron ore, while others will join transportation in the Zhenjiang-Wuhan area.</p>
<p>New Routes Opened in Wuhan and Zhenjiang</p>
<p>The new routes opened are as follows: (1) Hankou to Jinkou Town, (2) Hankou to Xintankou, (3) Hankou to Jiujiang, (4) Hankou to Xindi, (5) Jiujiang to Poyang Lake route in Nanchang (with ports of call at Hukou, Xingzi, Wucheng, Changyi Street, and Qiaoshe). The routes under planning are Zhenjiang to Yaojiaqiao, Zhenjiang to Xiaohekou, and Port to Xiaohe Town. Once this route is implemented, the connecting line to Jiangyin, Changzhou, and Wuxi will be shortened by thirty li.</p>
<h3>Family of Zhang Jinhai: Files Ancillary Civil Suit; Seeks Damages Totalling 510,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>In the case of Zhang Jinhai's tragic death, the Second Special Court held a hearing on the morning of the day before yesterday. Because the investigative procedures of the Judicial Advisory Office and the police had not been completed, a request was made to postpone the hearing for ten days. Only witnesses Zhang Yuebo and Peng Shuanglong were questioned, and it was ordered that the hearing be rescheduled for the 31st. It is understood that the family of Zhang Jinhai, whose deceased was 19 years old this year, and was the heir of two lineages, died tragically. The damage claim portion of the ancillary civil suit is calculated up to the age of 60. A petition has been filed with the court requesting that defendants Li Xiuying, Shi Yuan, Zhu Songcheng, Zhu Shu, Zhou Ruiting, and Li Hongda jointly compensate 460,000 yuan in national currency, plus 50,000 yuan for funeral expenses, totaling 510,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Social Welfare Establishes Bureau of Simple Insurance</h3>

<p>Health Care and Assistance</p>
<p>The purpose is to promote savings, which is also a boon to society. It is heard that the National Government has appointed Huang Xianggu as director and has designated No. 527 Laobazi Road, Shanghai as the bureau's address. Preparations are well underway, and it will soon be established.</p>
<h3>Briefing for Cadres of China United Film</h3>
<p>The China United Film Company was officially established on the 15th. Yesterday morning, the company's leaders held a briefing for cadres and staff of various departments at the Tiantongan Cultural Film Studio. First, Deputy Chairman Kawakita Nagamasa delivered a speech, hoping for mutual cooperation, mutual respect, and obedience to the orders of the General Manager.

<h3>Municipal Authorities Focus on the Future of Citizens' Lives: Limit the Current Prices of Goods; Changes Require Permission</h3>
<p>Recently, citizens have been anxious about their livelihoods. The municipal authorities have noticed this and recently taken the following measures: (1) The Municipal Bureau of Economic Affairs plans to restore the organization of the Price Appraisal Committee to specialize in evaluation work. However, before the committee is established, the selling prices at the end of last month will be taken as the maximum standard for various prices, except for those that have already been approved. If a business needs to raise prices due to legitimate reasons, it must first obtain approval from the Bureau of Economic Affairs; otherwise, it will be considered private price gouging. (2) The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has recently notified the various industry associations to instruct their member stores to abide by the price limits set by the Standing Bureau and not to deliberately violate them. All stores must adhere to the principle of considering both people's livelihood and business conditions and engage in legitimate business within the extent permitted by the authorities.</p>
<h3>Private Primary and Secondary Schools in This City Must All Register According to Law: Ministry of Education Directs Implementation</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Education previously inquired with the Ministry regarding two issues: whether all private church schools in the settlements, which often delay registration procedures, should be allowed to maintain their current status or must register; and whether the registration certificates for private primary and secondary schools issued by the former Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Education before the National Government returned to the capital after the incident (the war) should be recognized. It is now understood that the Ministry of Education has issued separate instructions as follows:</p>
<p>Church Schools Should Register</p>
<p>(1) The report has been noted. The registration of private schools is the basis for private schools to obtain establishment and is a legally prescribed procedure. The fact that private church schools in the city have delayed registration procedures not only causes the establishment of schools to lose its basis but also clearly violates educational laws and regulations. It is extremely ignorant of the facts. They should still be clearly informed and ordered to abide by the amended Private School Regulations and complete the registration procedures within the time limit in order to ensure supervision and respect laws. Please comply accordingly.</p>
<p>Certificates Before Return to Capital Are Invalid</p>
<p>(2) The report has been noted. All private primary and secondary schools in the two settlements of the city after the incident (the war) and before the National Government returned to the capital have not applied for registration with the Ministry of Education of the then Reorganized National Government and the Municipal Bureau of Education. They should be ordered to fulfill the registration procedures. Please be informed.</p>
<p>It is heard that the Bureau of Education will instruct the city's primary and secondary schools to comply and earnestly rectify the registration procedures after receiving the order.</p>
<h3>Preparatory Meeting of Citizens' Consumer Cooperative to be Held Today</h3>
<p>The Citizens' Consumer Cooperative was initiated by Wen Lanting, Yuan Lvdeng, and others. In view of the soaring prices of all goods in recent years, with no end in sight, everyone feels the hardship of a difficult life. The purpose is (1) to quickly exchange daily necessities so that members can enjoy the right to fair prices, not be affected by black market manipulation, and have a stable life; (2) to seek close cooperation between producers and consumers and to reduce the exploitation of middlemen and eliminate hoarding, so as to suppress and stabilize prices. This matter is of great importance, so it has been agreed to involve various industry associations to ensure that the association's affairs are conducted in a beneficial manner. The association is scheduled to hold a preparatory meeting in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce this afternoon (the 22nd). Representatives from various associations must attend to discuss the progress of the association's affairs.</p>

<p>Short Comment</p>
<h3>Personnel for Urgent Relief of North China Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>Regarding the urgent relief work in North China, we consistently feel that all matters should be handled with absolute swiftness. This is because the disaster victims suffering from hunger are in a state of agonizing torment every moment. If our relief goods can arrive even a moment sooner, it will reduce their suffering by that moment. It is even highly probable that rescuing the majority of disaster victims on the verge of death can be achieved by expediting the process by mere moments.</p>
<p>Therefore, we urge the rapid establishment of an urgent relief organization with centralized authority. This organization should grasp unified power and be capable of agile function. The selection of its leaders must be based on integrity and probity, recognized and trusted by society. Time is pressing, and further delays are simply unacceptable. We hope that the Government and relevant authorities will swiftly lead the establishment and carefully select suitable personnel.</p>
<p>We have already stated that the majority of citizens in Shanghai possess compassion and sympathy for the disaster victims in North China. Therefore, the prospect of raising donations is very promising. This is sufficiently demonstrated by the fact that our newspaper received donations of 100,000 yuan and countless letters of sympathy within five days. However, with donations in hand, how can we ensure that every cent donated by the donors benefits the disaster victims fully? How can we live up to the enthusiasm of the donors and, at the same time, the hope of the disaster victims? Therefore, we advocate that the selection of personnel for distributing relief should be particularly focused on integrity. Representatives selected from the Shanghai North China Disaster Relief Organization will distribute relief on the ground. I recall that a respected scholar in a certain disaster relief association once said: "The task of distributing relief should be entrusted to 'poor scholars' because they possess the integrity of the poor, the morality of the poor, the experience of the poor, and, even more so, the bookish eccentricity of those who do not love gold and silver and do not give preferential treatment." These are the ideal talents for distributing relief in our view. It is a point worth raising first.</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence</p>
<h3>The Problem of Rice Consumption in Beijing</h3>
<p>— A Student</p>
<p>During the tenth-anniversary celebration of the Sino-German Society on May 4th, Director-General Wang Yintai once said, "Nowadays, even basic necessities like clothing, food, and shelter have become a problem." The fact that clothing, food, and shelter have become major challenges for Beijing is an undeniable reality, and the fact that the Director-General openly stated it indicates its severity.</p>
<p>Beijing, as an ancient city, may be considered one of the three most beautiful cities in the world, along with Rome and Paris, from an artistic and architectural perspective. However, its glory is built on artificial embellishments rather than natural development. It is a city situated in a semi-desert plain. Since the existence of humans, the so-called "Peking Man," 200,000 years ago, the vitality of the land has long been depleted, and economic resources are, in reality, quite limited. In normal times, its prosperity is entirely supported by forces from all corners of the world. However, these are no longer normal times.</p>
<p>Beijing's grain supply has always been reliant on other regions. In the past, the Grand Canal brought rice from Jiangnan to the subjects under the Emperor's feet. Since the opening of maritime transport, Australian flour, and white rice from Annam, Siam, and Burma have been poured into the city in unknown quantities every year. Even after the July 7th Incident, the continued existence of maritime transport prevented it from suffering too greatly. However, since December of the year before last, this ancient city has been stranded in a desert, completely isolated from the outside world. Consequently, the grain problem has become more and more severe day by day. Furthermore, due to the machinations of hoarders, even upper-class families are starting to worry.</p>
<p>At the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, rice was less than 100 yuan per bag, and even at the end of last year, it was only around 200 yuan. However, everything skyrocketed after the Lunar New Year. Now, it is over 550 yuan per bag. Even the most inferior coarse grains, which contain ingredients such as peanut shell powder, tree bark powder, and bean cake powder previously used to feed pigs, are priced at 1.7 or 1.8 yuan per jin. An individual needs at least two jin of grain per day, which amounts to 3 or 4 yuan for grain alone, not including other expenses. If they have family responsibilities, the difficulties are even more unimaginable. However, the economic strength of the general population has not only not increased but has decreased. Because there are cutbacks everywhere, and in the situation where it is impossible to find jobs, they have no other choice but to accept low salaries and endure hunger. As a result, they can only attempt to economize on living expenses. The primary method of economizing is reducing the number of servants. On average, where they could previously afford seven servants, they now only employ one. But how can they cope with only one? Now, they are taking on multiple tasks themselves and also have to change from three meals to two meals, or even just eat the coarsest grains to make thin gruel. Those who could never afford servants in the past now have no choice but to entrust their lives to death. We can see many news stories about men of letters and scholars starving to death in the newspapers. However, while men of letters and scholars have obituaries in the newspapers, ordinary people who starve to death only receive the averted noses of passersby. Last year, a famous professor once righteously declared, "Whether good or bad, there's always a way to get by. It's impossible for anyone to starve to death in this world. I've never heard of anyone starving to death!" Now, facts speak louder than eloquence, and not long ago, I heard this same famous professor sigh dejectedly, "What to do? Are we going to starve to death?"</p>
<p>The North China Common Bureau has indeed made great efforts to find a solution to this serious grain problem. The Emergency Price Countermeasures Committee of last year, the Material and Price Handling Committee of this year, and the Price Cooperation Committee were also established due to the objective environmental needs. News of the punishment of unscrupulous merchants can often be seen in the newspapers. However, the consciences of the unscrupulous merchants are black, their wills are iron, and they do not have the slightest fear as a result. In February of this year, because hoarders spread rumors that the currency systems of the North and South would soon merge, gold prices soared temporarily, rising from 540 yuan per tael to 900 yuan in a single day, and then to over 1,600 yuan within two weeks. Moreover, this was just the listed price; in reality, it was impossible to buy at that price. The price of gold on the black market exceeded the 2,000 yuan mark. Later, Director-General Wang issued a declaration stabilizing the price of the joint currency, bringing it back down to around 1,000 yuan for the listed price. However, Director-General Wang's "Southern Rice Transported North" statement issued from Nanjing did not cause grain prices to fall. The authorities are indeed constantly making efforts to address the grain problem. The two porridge kitchens established by the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the eastern and western cities have saved many lives. Distributing seven or eight jin of grain per person at a low price each month, although not a major solution, is at least a small supplement for the citizens. The import of Manchurian and Mongolian mixed grains and the northbound transport of wheat from Su, Huai, Yu, and northern areas are all under negotiation. In addition, the North China Material and Price Committee announced on May 5th that merchants should report their grain reserves, "advising merchants with grain reserves exceeding half a year's consumption for their households to promptly report the types and quantities of their reserves so that relevant authorities can purchase their surplus at appropriate prices for fair distribution." Furthermore, the newspapers also contain articles every day advising merchants to sell their grain. However, it is hard to say how effective these articles will be. In recent days, the newspapers have added the words "Again Drops" to the headline "Grain Prices Fall" every day. However, when you take the newspaper with the headline "Grain Prices Fall Again" to a grain store and ask, rice is still 3.2 yuan per jin, and millet is 2.4 yuan per jin. What is most noteworthy is that the price of the grain allocated each time is higher than the previous time. The price of flour was 8 jiao per jin last time, but this time it has increased to 1.2 yuan. However, the efforts of the authorities have at least stabilized grain prices and prevented them from soaring again. From the time Director-General Wang went to Nanjing to negotiate the northern transport of southern rice to the present, the fluctuation in grain prices has been limited. This must be considered a success for the Common Bureau.</p>
<p>It is said that millet in Zhangjiakou is only worth 3 mao per jin, and rice from Jiangnan is worth 700 storage certificates per bag. If the obstacles to maritime transport have cut off the foreign grain supply to the ancient city, modern transportation lines can transport rice from Jiangnan to Beijing within 48 hours, saving the 2.5 million dying citizens. However, Cheng Shijun, Director of the Highway Bureau of the Construction General Office, who was sent to Nanjing by Director-General Wang to discuss the grain problem in North China, arrived in Nanjing on April 21st. As soon as he got off the train, he felt unwell and was taken to the Central Hospital for treatment. On April 27th, his condition worsened, and he passed away (see the April 30th *Shibao*). Could this be an omen for the future of the Beijing grain problem? (May 16th)</p>

<h3>Education and Nurturing</h3>
<p>— Yu Huairui</p>
<p>Chinese people's concepts of children have always focused on nurturing while neglecting education. In other words, they only seek quantity and disregard quality. Therefore, they consider it the supreme happiness and glory to have a house full of children and grandchildren while they are alive, and to have a long list of names printed on the obituary after their death. Thus, for thousands of years, "five generations under one roof" has been universally recognized as the most "honorable" thing. As for the children's future achievements in scholarship and career, their ability to serve society and the community, or even whether they have the qualifications to be a "person," all these questions are simply ignored. Although the Chinese people often proudly boast about their "large population," they are often inferior to other countries with smaller populations in everything. Neglecting education while nurturing children is the biggest reason for this. Therefore, our concept of children should value quality over quantity, and education over nurturing. Mr. Lu Xun said, "China needs parents of people, not parents of children." These words are truly incisive.</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the import of progressive ideas and the advocacy of those engaged in children's education in the country, many parents have gradually begun to pay attention to the issue of education. This is a welcome phenomenon. However, there is still a need to explore the methods of education.</p>
<p>In China, the position of parents has always been considered inviolable and dignified, so it is very</p>
<p>This is a wrong approach. You need to know that a child is a tender bud. It is certainly not a good idea to let him grow and perish on his own like weeds. But putting it indoors, tying it up with ropes and wires, only fertilizing it, and hoping that it will grow according to the form you like, will definitely make it lifeless, and may even die halfway. Because buds have their own personality, and they not only need fertilization, but also sunlight and rain! Therefore, experienced gardeners never force buds to grow according to a certain form, except for giving them the necessary sunlight and rain. They only let it develop freely according to the bud's personality. They understand that the gardener's responsibility is only to remove things that hinder the bud's growth, such as weeds. Only in this way can the buds be lush and prosperous, blooming and bearing fruit. Therefore, if parents hope that their children will achieve something in the future, they should remove the traditional coat of parents, use love as sunlight, and a patient and persuasive attitude as rain, to be a gardener who supports and cultivates this tender bud!</p>
<h3>A Record of Applying for a Job at the Bank of Communications</h3>
<p>— Failed</p>
<p>I took a university diploma and hurried to the destination to register. A kind of inexplicable fantasy immediately crept into my mind, "If I get accepted, then I must make good use of my first month's salary to make a new dress; no, buy a new pair of leather shoes; oh! I should send it to Mom."</p>
<p>"Who introduced you? High school or university?" The clerk asked.</p>
<p>"Who introduced me!" I suddenly dodged. I thought I didn't have anyone to introduce me. I just had a friend call me and tell me that the Bank of Communications was recruiting probationary staff members, and the qualification was a university degree, and told me I might as well try it.</p>
<p>"Here, you are not allowed to register without an introduction."</p>
<p>I hurriedly used the telephone to inquire about the friend who told me the news, it was thanks to his kindness that he came up with a way for me to pull a "introducer", so I proudly walked into the "Probationary Staff Registration Office again."</p>
<p>"Who introduced you, high school or university?" The clerk still asked in a bland manner.</p>
<p>"I was introduced by ×××, university graduate" Then I presented my university diploma, which I thought was satisfactory, and exchanged it for a list, I carefully filled it out one by one, and after seeing that there were no mistakes, I boldly handed it in, it seems that there is no registration fee, I felt relieved, I thought "After all, it is a big bank, it doesn't even charge for these paper expenses."</p>
<p>"Still missing three photos."</p>
<p>That's terrible, where can I get three photos, even if I go to take them, it's probably too late, but, I can't do it without photos, there's no choice, I had to run to the photo studio and ask him to take three expedited photos, "Passport photos are the fastest" So I got three photos that seemed like myself and handed them in, probably because the photos were too bad, the clerk looked at me carefully for two minutes, finally he gave me a "physical examination form", one of which was "The doctor's physical examination fee of seven yuan and five jiao is to be borne by the applicant."</p>
<p>"Seven yuan and five jiao" I looked at these four words, and reached into my pocket, luckily, I had two five-yuan bills and four single-yuan bills in my pocket, that was enough, I hid it from my family and went to check my body, waited in the doctor's office for a half hour, fortunately they called my name, I walked into the "examination room", and saw a "probationary member" taking off his clothes to check his lungs, the nurse told me to weigh myself, "So light, only one hundred and two pounds," "That's wrong, that's wrong! I weighed myself in Wing On Company and had one hundred and ten pounds." "I wanted to make my weight appear heavier, but the nurse still only agreed to write the record of one hundred and two pounds on the card. I started to take off my shirt, I was really scared, first because the weather was still cold, I really couldn't stand it; second, it was really ugly to take it off and be as thin as a rib, but, I still had to take it off anyway, from the doctor's facial expression, it seemed that he was not very satisfied with my body, he asked me if I coughed? Have you been sick? My answer was nothing, I argued that my body was very good.</p>
<p>Three days later, I received a notice allowing me to take the exam, I was so happy, so I prepared my lessons according to the exam schedule, I read economics and thought about commercial arithmetic, I read accounting and thought about Chinese, I was really anxious, I finally waited until three in the afternoon, a Chang car sent me to the entrance of Tatung University, I slowly walked in, it was still twenty minutes away from one thirty, the examination room seemed to be "full", I looked around, old and young were different; there were spirited ones; there were passable ones; there were those talking in English; there were also those taking advantage of the last minute. The first exam, foreign language, seemed easy, correction, self-recommendation letter, translation, composition and other questions, the second exam, commercial arithmetic, had several questions on big algebra and trigonometric topics, I studied commerce, things I had never encountered in four years, I didn't expect to meet them today, they looked easy, but I couldn't do them successfully, it was really ridiculous, the next day, I cheered up and took the exam again, Chinese two questions: one was composition and one was official document, I didn't know whether they were good or bad, then came economics and accounting, maybe it was because I studied this subject, it seemed easier than others.</p>
<p>How many university students will be accepted in a classroom? I started to doubt, sure enough, a "test character No. not listed page" notice finally appeared in front of my eyes, I dejectedly went to collect that university diploma that I thought was precious, I walked along, and reached into my pocket, the central storage certificates in my pocket were obviously much less, ah! "Trying to steal a chicken but losing the rice used as bait."</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of the Japanese Navy</h3>
<p>— Oshita Utarō</p>
<p>(3) Progress of Airplanes</p>
<p>On the parade ground in Yoyogi, hordes of people gathered to watch the excitement.</p>
<p>On this day, December 14th, Meiji 43 (1910), Captain Hino piloted a Grade Plateau-style airplane in the Japanese sky.</p>
<p>The engine adjustments had already taken up most of the day, from morning until 10:00 a.m. It slowly began to slide on the grass. A gust of crosswind blew and the airplane tumbled over, the wingtip supports breaking. Thus, they spent five more hours repairing it, and at 3:00 p.m. they began to slide again. The spectators roared. European electric. The airplane went faster than a car, but only on the ground. The spectators said:</p>
<p>"The airplane from the legends seems even faster!"</p>
<p>"Indeed, a very good thing, isn't it? Even cars probably can't compare!"</p>
<p>Amid the spectators' various discussions, the sliding gradually went smoothly. The aircraft finally lifted off the ground and ascended (though only one meter high). After flying like that for 30 meters, a thunderous cheer erupted and lasted for a long time. But the airplane was again hit by a crosswind, fell to the ground, and the supports broke again. Later, it was said that it was repaired again, ascended to a height of ten meters, and flew for about 60 meters. The next year, there was great progress. Captain Tokugawa piloted a Plélia airplane back and forth between Tokorozawa and Kawagoe, taking 32 minutes and 45 seconds to fly across a distance of 39.3 kilometers. The next day, he flew once more from the same place, but this time he did not return to Tokorozawa. He crashed in a mulberry field near Kawagoe. Four years later, in Taisho 5 (1916), the Naval Air Corps appeared. Subsequent progress was much faster than before. There were no more airplanes that could be blown over by crosswinds. It could even make transoceanic bombings in the vast open sky. The struts would no longer break. With the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the airplanes of the Imperial Army and Navy flew back and forth in the vast Pacific Ocean as if it were an everyday occurrence. In the future, perhaps there will be progress to the point where one can go anywhere at will. If airplanes with a carrying capacity of 2,000 tons and a range of 9,000 miles can be successfully manufactured, one can seize control of the Pacific Ocean simply by using airplanes. At that time, airplanes will of course no longer need runways and will even be able to stop and moor anywhere in the air at will.</p>
<p>According to American propaganda, stratospheric flight is currently under research, and there are plans to use very good large aircraft, carrying smaller aircraft to come and bomb Japan, which is steadily progressing. Also, according to newspaper reports, Germany is manufacturing airplanes to cross the Atlantic and bomb New York and Washington.</p>
<p>However, we are not afraid. We will protect Japan. We should follow the Navy's slogan in air defense training: "Train as if in real combat, and treat real combat as training." If incendiary bombs fall, we will treat these incendiary bombs as enemy soldiers landing on our own soil. These enemy soldiers are violent slaves wielding flamethrowers and hand grenades. And we, on our honored Japanese soil, will not allow enemy soldiers to stay for even a moment. On the front lines, our fathers, brothers, and sons are bleeding, stepping over corpses, and fighting to the death against the same brutal enemies. And in the rear, the Japanese people also have the same fighting will.</p>
<p>A certain Navy lieutenant commander said:</p>
<p>"We only think about defeating the enemy on the battlefield. We leave everything in the rear to you all."</p>
<p>That's right, there's no need to be an alarmist. Just fulfill your responsibilities in the rear and that will be enough. (Translated by the Wing from the *Western Asahi Shimbun*)</p>
<h3>Night Watch Jottings</h3>
<p>— This Person</p>
<p>Three days ago, I received a notice to stand guard as a member of the Self-Defense Corps. After briefly considering it, I decided to go on guard duty myself. Some people said that based on your position, you can apply for an exemption, but I don't intend to try to obtain this convenience at present. As for why I resolutely went on guard duty this time, to put it nicely, in the city of Shanghai under the wartime system, standing guard as a member of the Self-Defense Corps is a duty that every citizen should fulfill; but in reality, I am merely going on guard duty with a sense of trying it out.</p>
<p>The day for guard duty arrived. The time was from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. I ate dinner early and reported to the Lianbao Office on time. My left arm had to be fitted with a dust- and stain-covered Self-Defense Corps armband, my left shoulder was diagonally slung with a grass-green cloth band with a police whistle hanging on it and a bundle of hemp rope tied to the lower end, and my right hand was holding a short stick commonly used by street patrolmen. Dressed like this, I strode towards the assigned Post No. 22.</p>
<p>The guard post was actually a wooden cage with a volume of three feet square inside. It was fitted with glass windows all around so that you could see in all directions. When I pulled open the door and stepped into the cage, I found that the floor was full of sunflower seed shells and cigarette butts. This suggests that the cage life of several pioneers was quite leisurely and comfortable. Originally there was a thin board inside to sit on, but unexpectedly the board had been stolen, so I had to stand straight and look out. The predecessors were careless, and the successors suffered, and I couldn't help but feel a hint of resentment.</p>
<p>Across the road stands a ×× Palace, all the facade walls newly painted with a layer of vermilion paint: less than a few feet to the left, there is a majestic ×× Palace, the facade walls are also newly decorated, this is a large piece of golden paint. These two Taoist palaces have renovated their facades, shining brightly together, but the purpose is to attract business. This posture of grabbing business is the same as the ordinary shops that hang large bargain flags, which are as vulgar. Look, a large "Tao" character is clearly installed on the gate of the ×× Palace, which clearly shows that they have a great way to make money. At this time, I remembered that I had never seen monks or Taoists on guard duty in the Self-Defense Corps, which was a bit puzzling. Maybe monks and Taoists have belonged to people outside the world since ancient times, and now they should be different from ordinary citizens in complying with the wartime system?</p>
<p>When several rickshaws carrying a young couple side by side drove by, I saw an old beggar with tattered clothes running after the people in the car, begging for alms, really chasing the car desperately. This posture of making a living is really not surprising, think about it, at a time when prices are rising endlessly, who is not desperately struggling on the hunger line? Therefore, if it is said that the life of a beggar is pitiful, then how can the life of our ordinary people not be pitiful! The difference between them is only fifty steps and a hundred steps. If it is said that the life of a beggar is despicable, let's not talk about people in other classes. Just take the officials that everyone envies as an example, then please read Zong Chen's "Letter to Liu Yizhang," and you will know that the life of officials is also begging for things by running around and prostrating. This has been the case since ancient times, and it is even more so now!</p>
<p>Who said that three hours would slip by easily like a wisp of smoke? I stood straight, standing, and finally felt twinges of soreness in my legs! Fortunately, I used to be a teacher for a few years, and I always stood in the classroom for three or four hours every day, so these legs can be said to have been quite trained; at the same time, I originally had a spirit of trying it out this time, and I was quite able to endure all kinds of discomforts. Therefore, I finally spent three hours in the cage by gritting my teeth. At nine o'clock, I couldn't wait to jump out of the guard post to cancel my duty, just like a caged bird flying out of the cage into the sky. At this time, my body and mind were full of the pleasure of freedom!</p>
<h3>Bonsai Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Tangdi</p>
<p>Bored on a long day, I drove to the YMCA on Eight Immortals Bridge to view the bonsai exhibition. The venue was located in the library on the second floor; there were hundreds of bonsai, large and small. The pots were no more than a foot wide, yet they contained picturesque landscapes with staggered pavilions and uniquely creative designs. Chen Meiqing's pines and cypresses, for example, retained their natural beauty. Kong Zhiqing's "Misty Rain," "Immortals Celebrating Longevity," and "Ancient Cypress Reaching the Sky" were meticulously painted. How could one achieve this without the skill of an experienced craftsman? There was also a "Mountain Dwelling Picture" that resembled the style of Tang Yin. Shou Juan was known for his expertise in cultivating ancient trees, and his submissions this time were indeed masterpieces. Zhuo Duo's bonsai made from waste paper surprisingly had a vibrant charm, unique to the entire venue. Peng Juzhou's "Withered Wood Mandarin Ducks" had old branches coiling out from the stone crevices; "Elixir Attaining the Ninth Heaven" featured a single branch extending diagonally from a pottery gourd, displaying ingenious creativity. Several grotesque rocks by Huang Jingwan and Zi Shuyu were either lying down or standing like swords, with various imposing shapes. "A Corner of Guilin" and "Layered Peaks Soaring Green" showcased majestic mountains, rarely seen in post-war Shanghai. As for the Xu brothers, Zihua and Ziling, known for their rocks and stones, their submissions this time, such as "Jiang Village Enjoying Summer" and "Night Tour of Red Cliff," were not only structurally novel but also carefully considered color harmony, making people feel refreshed and delighted. The largest piece in the entire venue was "Blessed Land," with a two-foot-tall ancient cypress emerging gracefully from the stone crevices, undoubtedly the result of long-term effort. In the mountain cave, an old Taoist sat quietly with a whisk, making viewers feel a desire to escape the mundane world. In short, the quality and quantity of the exhibits this time were more advanced than the previous one, living up to the YMCA's aim of promoting refined entertainment. It is said that from today, the YMCA will not charge admission for the three-day exhibition, and the proceeds from the sale of flowers and scenery will be used to provide loans to small farmers and aid drought relief in North China.</p>

<h3>Simple Treatment for Severe Colds</h3>
<p>— Huang Jimei</p>
<p>Dr. Ding Huikang recently gave a lecture on the treatment of severe colds at the Baojia Youth Department. The method is extremely simple. It is said that those suffering from severe colds only need to completely open the south-facing window when sleeping at night, while all east, west, and north-facing windows must be closed. Sleeping like this until dawn will immediately cure the severe cold. Even if the cough is severe the night before, it will be completely eradicated by morning. The more severe the cold, the more effective the treatment, and Mr. Ding guarantees and takes responsibility for it. When we heard Mr. Ding's treatment for severe colds, we couldn't help but burst into laughter, thinking that no member would believe such a treatment. However, unfortunately, three days after listening to Mr. Ding's treatment, I actually caught a severe cold. At this time, I wanted to try the treatment that Mr. Ding told us about. But on the second day, the severe cold not only didn't get better but became even worse. I decided to experiment with Mr. Ding's treatment to see if it was effective. I made up my mind and followed Mr. Ding's method as soon as evening came. Surprisingly, when I woke up at dawn, the severe cold I had was indeed completely cured. This simple and effective method is worth recommending.</p>
<h3>Pay Attention to Public Park Lawns</h3>
<p>— Xu Wancheng</p>
<p>Recently, due to grass planting, walking on the lawns in various parks has been prohibited. Signs have been posted saying "Do Not Walk on the Lawn," and ropes have been used to block them off. Chinese people generally do not pay attention to public morality. Even with thick ropes and signs saying "Do Not Walk on the Lawn," there are still people who violate the "park rules." When Chinese police try to dissuade them, they often refuse to listen, leading to foreigners slapping them. It is heartbreaking to hear about. I hope that tourists will be more respectful in the future.</p>
<h3>All Sectors Aid Teacher Zhou</h3>
<p>After this newspaper published an article yesterday about an elementary school teacher coughing up blood and seeking help, enthusiastic people from all walks of life have sent letters expressing sympathy and donating medical expenses, including: (1) Mr. Chen Chongyuan, the abdominal fruit manufacturer from the Tongzhou Food Company, donated 500 yuan. (Mr. Chen recently organized a small teaching, production, sales, economic, and credit cooperative to benefit small teaching staff.) (2) A reader of Shenbao sent a membership card for the Kangjian Insurance Clinic, hosted by medical doctor Zhou Shouxiang, providing free treatment for one year. (3) 257 yuan from teachers and students of the Far East Elementary School. (4) 200 yuan from students of grades four and six of the Mibo First Elementary School. (5) 100 yuan from an anonymous person at the Yeda Bank. (6) 50 yuan from Mr. Mingyin. (7) 20 yuan from Mr. Ma Junjing. (8) 10 yuan each from anonymous people from the Anren Hermitage, totaling 1,147 yuan. All of these will be transferred to Mr. Zhou, and we express our gratitude on his behalf. In addition, the Shanghai Civilian Lung Disease Hospital on Hongqiao Road sent a letter offering to admit Mr. Zhou, waiving all medical expenses and only charging for meals. We also express our gratitude.</p>
<p>Also, Mr. Qiao Tianqing sent 100 yuan yesterday to help Mr. Yingqi, which has been forwarded immediately. Thank you.</p>
<p>Seeking Remittances My relative, Mr. Feng, is currently in Ganzhou and urgently needs remittances for assistance. If there are any Shanghai banks or shops that can remit to that area, please send a letter to the Social Services section of Shenbao. Thank you very much, Huang Jiesun.</p>
<p>Medical Lecture On the 23rd (Sunday) at 2 PM, Dr. Liang Junqing, a medical doctor who studied in Germany, will give a lecture at Jing'an Temple on general knowledge of vaccinations. Citizens are welcome to attend.</p>

<h3>How to Adjust the Organization of the Business Control Association</h3>
<p>The organization of the lower-level institutions of the Business Control Association, namely the major commodity trade associations and federations of trade associations, is progressing vigorously. Among the 50 trade associations, 10 associations, including the Cotton Association, have been established. On the 18th, the Municipal Government announced the initiators designated by the Industry Department for 16 trade associations. It is heard that the authorities will continue to appoint initiators in the future. Therefore, the overall adjustment of the organization of the Business Control Association is becoming more important and is of concern to all parties. To strengthen the Business Control Association, the following points should be noted:</p>
<p>(1) Emphasize the Second Phase of Organization Work Because the new economic policy needs to be implemented quickly, the organizational structure of the Business Control Association is being organized from top to bottom (i.e., from the board of directors and supervisors to the federation, and from the federation to the trade association). However, after this work is completed, the second step should be to strengthen the organization from the bottom up. The Business Control Association is not a government-controlled organization but should have the nature of a self-governing organization. Therefore, the structure must be readjusted to ensure that the upper-level institutions fully absorb the intentions of the lower-level trade associations.</p>
<p>(2) The Relationship Between the Business Control Association and the Industry and Food Departments The Business Control Association is naturally subject to the guidance and supervision of the competent government departments, the Industry Department and the Food Department. However, the current reorganization of the trade associations, from top to bottom, with designated initiators, is directly guided by the two departments, and the Business Control Association itself is hardly involved. To strengthen control in the future, many parties advocate that the reorganization of the federations and trade associations should be implemented based on the creativity and responsibility of the Business Control Association itself. First, the National Government should select the board of directors and supervisors from the financial circles in the concession, and then the lower-level trade associations should re-elect them in an autonomous manner. In particular, the directors and supervisors of the lower-level federations and trade associations must be re-elected purely by the trade associations.</p>
<p>(3) Adjust the Relationship Between the Industry and Food Departments in Guiding the Business Control Association According to the nature of the major commodities, the Business Control Association is guided by the Industry Department and the Food Department respectively. Among the major commodities, some, such as oil, have the dual properties of food and industrial raw materials. There are many such commodities, which can easily cause friction between the trade associations under the Food Department and the Industry Department. It is hoped that this can be rationally adjusted.</p>
<p>(4) The Relationship Between the Industry Department and the Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau Most of the work of designating the initiators of the federations of trade associations is handled by the Industry Department itself. The registration of the associations and other matters are handled by the Municipal Economic Bureau, which maintains contact with the Materials Control Bureau of the Public Works Department to handle the reorganization of the associations. This transitional method of dual supervision should be corrected quickly and unified under the supervision of the Municipal Economic Bureau.</p>
<p>(5) The Relationship Between the Trade Associations and the Federations of Trade Associations The lower-level institutions of the Business Control Association and their joint organizations, which are organized from top to bottom, should be re-established from the bottom up. This is the opinion of various powerful trade associations.</p>
<p>(6) The Relationship Between the Business Control Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which has a long history, has become a commercial forum and even a commercial social organization. It does not conflict with the Business Control Association in terms of parallel and dual guidance. However, the future focus of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's work must be clearly defined, and its practical activities must be guided.</p>
<p>In short, the establishment of the organization of the Business Control Association is not yet complete. To establish a truly autonomous organization that can unleash the power of national capital based on autonomy and creativity, further efforts are still needed in the future.

<h3>Under the Jurisdiction of the Food Department Six Trade Associations Established</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 21st) at 4 PM, Tang Shoumin, Chairman of the National Business Control Association, and Wen Lanting, Supervisor, held a tea party on the eighth floor of the Jinmen Hotel to welcome the establishment of the six trade associations under the jurisdiction of the Food Department. They also invited Gu Baoheng, Minister of Food, and the directors, section chiefs, and bureau chiefs of the department to attend. Chairman Tang first delivered an opening speech,</p>
<p>mainly saying that the six trade associations under the jurisdiction of the Food Department and the six trade associations in the Shanghai region were able to exert their utmost efforts in the shortest possible time to make it a reality, thanks to the effective supervision of Minister Gu and his subordinate officials. He expressed his gratitude. He then said that the six industries are deeply and closely related to the future of the people's food, and we should promote the spirit of control to seek the stability of the people's food. Finally, he said that if any of the industries believes that the current control laws and regulations are not suitable for commercial conditions, as long as they do not violate the meaning of control, they can state the reasons and make suggestions to the government. He also hoped that the federations of trade associations would pay attention to advising members of the trade associations not to engage in speculative hoarding, which would cause public criticism.</p>
<p>Minister Gu's Speech</p>
<p>He was extremely pleased with the sincere cooperation of the industry leaders in the past two months, which achieved satisfactory results. He also explained the changes in the control mechanism and hoped that the industry would understand the government's intentions. He said that the trade associations and federations of trade associations that have been established should not be mistaken as interest groups of Xutong. They should strive to benefit the country, the nation, and the future of the lumber industry, based on the spirit of national economy, government, and self-reliance of merchants, and fulfill the mission of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Director Ji of the Food Department's Shanghai Office</p>
<p>First explained the establishment of the various trade associations and federations of trade associations, and elaborated on the different responsibilities and tasks of people's organizations today and in the past. His interpretation of legal meaning was exquisite. Subsequently, representatives of the six industries stood up one after another to express their love and willingness to work together to complete this arduous mission.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Establishes Central China Soap Control Association</h3>
<p>The soap control mechanism was originally planned to be a joint Chinese-Japanese organization. However, due to various reasons, the original plan was changed, and both the Chinese and Japanese sides established control mechanisms separately, both directly under the jurisdiction of the Business Control Association.</p>
<p>The Japanese soap industry, in accordance with the instructions of the embassy authorities on May 6, disbanded the past soap-related associations and decided to prepare for the establishment of the Central China Soap Control Association (Chinese name: Central China Soap Control Association). The eight major firms, including Japan Oil and Fat First Industrial Pharmaceutical, Maeda Yoko, Shanghai Oil and Fat Industry, Mitsui Yoko, Mitsubishi Corporation, Daimaru Yoko, and Idemitsu Kosan, were appointed as organizers and have already prepared. The inaugural meeting was held at the Japanese Club at 2 PM on the 19th. At this point, the lower-level institutions of the soap sector within the Business Control Association have been established.</p>
<p>At the inaugural meeting, after the Commercial and Industrial Section Chief of the Embassy Office, Mr. Tokunaga (representative), performed the full salute, the chairman was elected, the preparatory process was reported, the articles of association were reviewed, and the directors and supervisors were elected. Then the chairman delivered a speech, and Mr. Tokunaga, Commercial and Industrial Section Chief (representative), gave instructions, with many words of encouragement.</p>
<p>The association is organized by soap manufacturers and powerful soap distributors with business departments or offices in Central China. The internal organization is divided into production and distribution departments. Under the guidance and supervision of the Embassy Office, the association will adjust the supply of soap, plan and implement production and distribution, find ways to purchase raw materials, and set prices. The president, vice president, directors, and supervisors of the association are as follows:</p>
<p>President: Yoshitaka Mochida of Japan Oil and Fat, Vice President: Mitsubishi Corporation, Accounting Director: Daimaru Yoko, Directors: First Industrial Pharmaceutical, Maeda Yoko, Shanghai Oil and Fat, Mitsui Yoko, Idemitsu Kosan, Supervisors: Rongtai Yoko, Kyuko Yoko. It is believed that although the Chinese soap industry mechanism has not been realized at the same time, it is believed that it will also be established soon. (Yunpeng: Translated from the Mainland News, May 21)</p>
<h3>Hua Stock Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday, most Hua stocks fell in a soft market. This was because they were controlled by tight money and new and old investors were temporarily watching and waiting in a falling market. Trading was not active, but the new shares of Great China Match stood out, rising under continued demand. Nanyang Tobacco Company's trading was sparse and prices were offered. The department store industry was the weakest. Wing On, Sincere, and China Products Company all saw small squeezes. Wing On Textile Mill's selling pressure did not subside, and Mayar was also weak. In the pharmaceutical industry, Sino-French Pharmacy was flat, and New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory fell slightly. Zhabei Water and Electricity and China Electric Company both softened. In the cultural industry, China Book Company was flat, while Commercial Press and World Book Company fell slightly. Jiu'an Industrial and New Yick Land saw little change. New shares of Tongyi Trust and Jingfu Socks and Shirts Factory were firm under demand.</p>
<h3>Brief Notes</h3>
<p>Baokang Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory Co., Ltd. was initiated by Wu Yunqi, Jiang Yushan, and others, and the preparation has been going on for a year. The capital has been fully paid up. The inaugural meeting is scheduled to be held at the Fulai Hotel on Guangxi Road at 2 PM on the 22nd of this month. The office is located at No. 4, Lane 129, South Chengdu Road.</p>
<p>The Sanhang Economic Weekly, jointly organized by Dakang Silk Industry and Shanghai Industrial Federation, is known as a popular reading material in the economic circles of this city. The 18th issue of Volume 2 will be published today, coinciding with the special issue of Shanghai Industrial Bank. In addition to the existing economic review, finance, industry and commerce, and commodity sections, it also publishes a brief history of the Shanghai Industrial Bank's development and a very detailed description of the current general banking industry. Subscribers can contact No. 112, Xiaobo Road.</p>
<h3>National Federations of Trade Associations Renamed Regional Federations of Trade Associations</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Food has guided the establishment and distribution of emblems for the national federations of trade associations for six major commodities: wheat flour, miscellaneous grains, edible oil, sugar, livestock products, and eggs, and they have begun operations. However, the words "national" seem inappropriate because the organization includes three provinces and two special municipalities. Therefore, it has been decided to rename them "Regional Federations of Trade Associations." The order has been formally issued to the various regional trade associations to comply.</p>
