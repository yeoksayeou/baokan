<p>社評</p>
<h3>我們期待着八月一日</h3>
<p>—並盼法國政府迅作明朗的表示</p>
<p>八月一日，我們期待着的八月一日，將是中華民國開始實現主權完整的一日，將是全國人民百年來寤寐以求的理想實現之一日，因爲依據今年六月三十日中日在南京簽訂的交還上海公共租界的協定，百年來損害我國主權的根據地上海租界，將由日本正式交還了！這是百年來中國屈辱史的總結，同時，也是今後中日合作建設新東亞光榮史的開始。然而，在今天，我們還不能不引爲遺憾者，就是法國政府對於交還上海法租界的諾言，還沒有切實踐行的明朗表示，也就是說，在友邦日本切實踐行其全部諾言以尊重我國主權完整的日子，法國政府對於交還租界的日期尙未確定。在中國人心和在國際視聽上，顯然是一種陰影，我們希望法政府能够迅速掃除這個陰影！</p>
<p>法租界之存在，在中國民衆的心理上，同樣是一種極大的恥辱，今公共租界已因日本之友好協力而交還，獨有法租界尙繼續存在，我們認爲這是法國政府給予中國國家及人民的不良印象，將無可消釋，自非中法邦交之福。而從國家的立塲說，則誠如本市陳市長所說：「法租界之行政權一日不交回，即上海市政仍然未能完整，亦即中國之行政樣未能完整」，對於正向獨立自主之大道邁進中的中國，自足召致嚴重的阻礙。因此，我們希望我國政府，迅與法國當局進行具體的協商，敦促法國政府實踐諾言。我們期待着，如汪行政院長所說：「務使上海法租界之交還最遲於八月一日以前，得以實現」。</p>
<p>從法國的利害說，教們設身處地的硏究，覺得絲毫沒有遲緩交還法租界的必要。相反的，倒是應該迅速交還。法國今日的處境非常艱險，而且同樣是在向新生之途邁進，要求恢復往日的光榮，而重建其在國際上重要的地位，首在建立國際問的威信，實踐對華諾言，交還上海租界，且至遲在八月一日以前實現，這樣，不僅對於中法邦交前途，對於中法國民感情，均有良好的增進。從當前的國際形勢說，全世界正義人類，正在準備着保衛眞理打倒英美覇道之決戰，具有着三次革命光榮的法蘭西，在這次大決戰中，自將爲重要之一員而不願自棄其天職的，那麽，不讓日本專美於前，以迅速實行交還上海租界表示其協力推進正義之決心，不但爲中國及東亞民族的期待，應該也是每一個法國正義人士共同的期待。</p>
<p>爲着八月一日這光榮的日子，不僅是中國一國而目是未來國際道義與新秩序的前奏，我們希望法國當局從遠處大處着眼，在八月一日同時實行交還上海法租界，並盼義大利政府等，都能媲美日本，相繼作同樣的表示！使中國主權完整能够完全實現，使中國在獨立自主的過程中獲得成功，這不僅是中國的光榮，同時也是關係各友邦的光榮！因此，我們期待着八月一日，這是新東亞建設與新世界秩序開始之日！</p>

<h3>土耳其堅守中立</h3>
<p>北非戰事告終後，英美掮起了侵攻歐洲的大招牌，照例用激烈的神經戰的老調，利用無綫電，新聞，及第五縱隊的　動，大肆宣傳。土耳其每决被利用爲宣傳的好資料，自軸心軍從突尼西亞撤退後，流傳着種種關於土耳其的煽惑性消息。例如「土耳其決定放棄中立態度，取非交戰國態度」，或「土耳其決定將　開放英美的　蘇路綫　　尼爾海峽」，或「土耳其將近參加英美方面參戰」，或「英美空軍將從土耳其的空軍基地轟炸羅馬尼亞油田」等等。記者最近於往返柏林途次，曾在蘇斐亞，布加勒斯特，布達佩斯特等巴爾幹各首都略作勾留，在那裏所接觸的人們，對土耳其似乎特別來得關心。不用說，今日土耳共如被戰火延及，則必然立即蔓延到巴爾幹。道就是巴爾幹諸國對土耳共的動向特別加以注意的緣故。當判斷今日的情勢時，巴爾幹人士的觀測，比我們在土耳其的人似　加敏感，記者在那裏覺得戴上了極强烈的有色眼鏡。</p>
<p>所以我們不能不認淸敵方把土耳其頂名的對巴爾幹宣傳的眞相。在巴爾幹所聽到的議論，大概都是敵方製造的煽惑或其類似的東西。對此宣傳，士耳其全國僅一致希望本國的保全。所以自己走進戰爭去是全然不會的。英美今日確加以相當的注意以謀巴爾幹的軍事的强化，英美擬鼓動土耳其的用意，不在於想使土耳其在對軸心的戰爭上有直接的武力合作，而在於準備應付未來或將發生的事態。</p>
<p>所以在英美看來，士耳其的利用價值，不在求得軍事的協力，土耳其如立在英美方面，不過是把她當作對軸心「擺架子」的手段，在英美看來，土耳其究竟還沒有到可派大用場的時候。</p>
<p>英美今日已經充分利用土耳其當作「擺架子」的手段了。但今日巴爾幹諸國的緊張，不僅以土耳其爲對象，他們預料敵方將在脫拉基亞，希臘亞得利亞海沿岸各地攻擊，因而正在考慮萬一的對策。</p>
<p>至於土耳其國內，依然極爲平靜，軍隊的配置也似從前一樣。新的動員似不致實行，自五月中旬起，土耳其軍艦佈置了一個迷陣，黑海沿岸，博斯波魯斯海峽燈台的燈一律加以熄滅，頗引起人們的注意，但土耳其不是預料地中海作戰快要到來，爲了避免池魚之殃起見，而取的一種須防手段嗎？</p>
<p>所以在土耳其全不見行將發生大規模行動的軍事活動，在經濟上，僅爲了維持軍事費而加稅數决，而物價亦有昂　的傾向，但國民的表情，至爲平靜，信賴政府要人維持中立的一再聲明。土耳其行將加入戰爭的可能性，不成爲一般人民的日常話題。（翔：譯自六月二十八日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>日大本營公布　倫特巴島方面戰況　日帝國軍航空隊發揮威力</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　日大本營於一日下午五時三十分發表：（一）六月三十日晨在所羅鬥羣島倫特巴島方面，發現由運輸船巡洋艦等組成之敵軍有力部隊，其一部並在該島登陸。（二）帝國海軍航空部隊已數度轟炸上述之敵軍，計炸沉炸毀其運輸船六艘。巡洋艦三艘。驅逐艦一艘，並共擊落敵機三十一架。（三）該方面帝國陸海軍部刻正於緊密協助之下，繼續作戰中。</p>
<p>東京一日中央社電　據此間軍事專家談稱：日美雙方自去年八月以來，即在南太平洋方面展開法戰，情形日趨激烈。其間該方面之日海軍航空部隊，均不容敵方稍有蠢動，敵方即有所蠢動，亦均被日軍擊破，尤以自龍加灣空戰發生以來。其戰鬥情形更趨激烈。日美雙方均竭全力撕殺，共未來戰鬥情形實不難想像。六月卅日晨，美國果突然出現新幾內亞島孟達南方，當時有船舶十數艘組成之運輸船團由巡洋艦驅逐艦護衛，並以有力之航空部隊在上空警戒，用登陸舟艇一百餘艘，分自新幾內亞島西部南岸約十公里之倫特巴島北岸至南岸一帶登陸，日軍航空部隊發現後，當即乘機大舉急襲，突破敵戰鬥機陣容，猛炸敵運輸船團，計炸沉炸毀敵運輸船六艘，巡洋艦三艘，驅遂艦一艘。獲得莫大戰果。然敵軍一部業已登陸，故該方面日陸海軍部隊刻正在與敵鏖戰中，預料日軍將　開澈底擊滅美之有力作戰云。</p>
<p>東京一日中央社電　反軸心機於六月二十七日晨以互人式轟炸機，陶格拉斯式轟炸機·諾斯洛浦式轟炸機，及卡基斯式戰鬥機等共計五十架，來襲哥倫新加拉島。被日軍高射砲擊落八架。又反軸心機於六月二十八日白晝以統一式「B24」型，卡斯基式「P40」型，及陶格拉斯「FBD」型合計六十八架之戰鬥轟炸機聯合編隊，來襲伊薩伯爾島，日軍地上部隊常即對之迎擊，結果擊落其「FBD」型三架。</p>
<p>日機猛炸達爾文港</p>
<p>里斯本一日中央社電　據墨爾　轉來之反軸心佈告稱：日轟炸機編隊於戰鬥機衛搧　下，昨日再襲達爾文港及新幾內亞之米倫灣，該處所受損燬及傷亡相常浩大。該佈告文稱，達爾文港上空空戰時，當有反軸心機六架被擊落。</p>
<p>柏林一日中央社電　德國新聞社軍事訪員漢倫斯里本宣稱：最近日陸軍飛機之空襲北澳達爾文港之軍事設備，或爲新發展之先聲。遠離歐洲戰塲之東亞同盟國日本現正採取決定，可於最近之猛轟達爾文港見之，此爲日陸軍航空隊之首次大規模行動，由此事實可斷定日本對澳攻勢已有極良好進步，頗有大事業已迫切之可能，或即爲太平洋戰事新階段之開始云。</p>
<h3>汪主席蒞蘇參加　清鄉二週紀念　蘇錫各界舉行盛大慶祝</h3>
<p>蘇州一日中央社電　最高領袖在主席以淸鄉工作發軔於蘇州，特乘淸鄉二週紀念之期，親臨巡視，此爲第五次巡視淸鄉區，亦即爲第四次蒞蘇巡視。隨行人員有行政院秘書長陳春圃，陸軍部長葉蓬，外交部次長周降庠·國府中將參軍陳昌祖·行政院淸鄉事務局長在曼雲，曁友邦柴山寺岡兩氏。主席於三十日下午四時許自首都啓節，過鎭扛時由鎭江地區淸鄉主任袁殊啣李省長命，登車隨侍，沿述各縣民衆持旗恭迎者至眾，下午七時四十九分節駕抵蘇。李省長率同文武職官，在車站恭迎。全席下軍後與李省長等歡迎人員寒暄，即啓節入城，沿途民衆手持旗幟，夾道歉迎高呼　汪主席萬歲·情况至爲熱烈。抵行轅時由李省長率同各聽處周長及各縣縣長分班觀見致敬。八時二十分由李省長在主席行轅恭宴。當晚主席並爲淸鄉二週紀念發表宣言，一日晨八時三十分主席在行轅聽取李省長報告，八時五十五分至九時五十五分聽取駐蘇友邦將領報告，一時正主席躬臨宮巷淸鄉紀念館，出席江蘇省淸鄉三週紀念慶祝大會。</p>
<p>汪主席致訓詞</p>
<p>蘇州一日中央社電，最高領袖在全席於本日親臨蘇省淸鄉二週紀念大會致訓，出席代表恭聆之下。莫不感奮，茲恭錄主席訓詞要點於筏：淸鄉工作始於民國三十年七月一日，當去年淸鄉一週紀念時。水人曾經說過。淸鄉工作的目的，首在促進全國和平。協力大東亞戰爭，際今當二週年紀念時，我國業已參加大東亞戰爭，以爭取中舉民族之復興及東亞之解放，兩年來承友邦方面多予協助，及淸鄉工作同志及民衆之努力，本人於此深致敬意與謝意。溯自淸鄉工作開始時，祇指定江蘇十縣首先舉辦，其意義即先以一小部份地區作爲全國模範之雛型，現在淸鄉工作已將遍及全國，蘇省淸鄉由一期繼續到四期，並拓展至太湖東南地區，浙江地區，上海地區，湖北安徽廣東等省均已先後展開淸鄉工作，蘇北地區亦因淸鄉關係而返歸江蘇，所以當前的淸鄉工作，其範園之廣大，與發軔之始，截然不同，是以淸鄉委員會已因事實之需要而機構變更，蓋淸鄉工作本來是一般性的，非特殊性的，是永久性的，非臨時性的，但過去竟有人以爲淸鄉工作祗須淸鄉委員會負其事責，其實淸鄉工作，是全國都要做的，應該各院部一體督促協力的，淸鄉工作劃爲行政院負責，亦即此意。中國爲農業社會國家，尙未進入工業社會，淸鄉目的廠名思義係注重於農村者，因農民是中國的生產者，大東亞戰爭既爲長期戰，我國最主要之工作，厥爲增加生產，要增加生產，必先全力保護生產者，鄉村安定，則農民一心一力耕稼，可使禾實豐登，供獻於大東亞戰爭，保障治安，亦即所以保障生產者之安全。本人以滿腔熱誠，馨香祝賀淸鄉二週紀念。</p>
<p>汪主席宣言</p>
<p>蘇州一日中央社電　最高領袖汪主席以淸鄉工作發軔於蘇州，特於淸鄉二週紀念之期，親臨巡視，並爲淸鄉二週紀念發表宣言如下：本月一日爲江蘇淸鄉第二週年紀念之期，鄙人特於本日前來蘇州，致滿腔罄香禱祝之至意。計鄙人於二年以來，五度巡視淸鄉區，每一度輒覺有一度之進步。此次於友邦軍事常局盛意援助，及李省長上下盡瘁奉公，進行不懈，故能獲此成績，鄙人於此深致敬意。迥溯卅年七月一日，淸鄉舉辦之始，其所根據爲和平反共建國之國策；及至去年，則已進一步而爲在大東亞戰爭期間，而以淸鄉工作貢獻於大東亞戰爭，勉盡後方之責任，使大束亞前綫將士，無後顧之憂：及至今年則又進一步參加大東亞戰爭，由同甘共苦之精神，進而爲同生共死。在此時間，所謂淸鄉工作，如保障治安，則當注意於保陳治安之目的。在維護大東亞戰爭之後方秩序；如增加生產，則當注意於生產之目的，在使大東亞戰爭之需要，在不斷得到後方之供給。由此言之，保障治安，則必愛護保障治安者，如軍警公務員皆是；增加生產，則必愛護生產者，如農民工人，是彼此以親愛精誠之心，舉精誠團結之實。將欲自愛其國，互愛其鄰。共愛束亞尤必自每個人民，亙相親愛。於保障治安增加生產，近言之，爲淸鄉之目的，遠言之，則參加大東亞戰爭之意義，亦在於此。願以復興中華保衛東亞之意義，爲江蘇省政府及人民祝。並願以此祝淸鄉二週年，給與和平反共建國國策及參加大東亞戰爭以莫大之意義及期望，汪兆銘，七月一日。</p>

<h3>甘肅發生暴動　胡宗南任討伐指揮</h3>
<p>北京一日中央社電　甘肅省地處四北地區，現爲渝方西北重鎭，但該省境內日前突於政治秘密結社策動之下，發生大規模反蔣暴動，渝方開發西北之工作，因而頓告停頓，使抗戰力遭受甚大打擊，蓋本年一月間　州南方之臨洮縣境，突有囘教徒的八千餘因反抗渝方　政，起而暴動，於是在西北地區具有隱勢力之政治秘密結社哥老會，乃乘機崛起，鼓動暴動，彼等標榜打倒渝甘肅省主席谷正倫，聚衆十餘萬。推前隸囘系軍馬步靑部之馬富普爲首，編成「富善救國軍」八支隊。漸次擴大勢力，至三月佔領臨夏顯城。四月間時而出沒於西蘭公路，襲擊焚燒渝方連絡車及民間汽車，並佔領臨洮榆中臨潭定西等甘省內主要各縣。至五月上旬更切斷蘭州與西安之交通，事態遂形擴大，渝方對此初朱軍視至此乃大感恐慌，而任命渝第卅四集團軍長胡宗南爲討伐總指揮，以圖以武力敉平，並令渝方第八戰區司令朱紹良負責撫揖招降工作，但此項暴動仍毫無平息之望，事態似正日益擴大中。</p>
<p>北京一日中央社電　甘肅省最近突發生叛蔣暴動參加囘敎徒的十數萬，於哥老會指揮下，以囘教將領馬富善爲首領，已奪取岷山山脈（自蘭州南方至四川省境，北路甘省中地區一帶之各要地，與出動彈壓之渝軍相峙。此項叛軍於表而上雖係受哥老會指導，然觀其對民衆宣傳工作情形，或佔領渝方各機關時多採共黨遊擊戰法，且每於發生暴動時，渝軍即强行封鎖陝甘寗邊區，故可知其內將必有中共軍暗中活躍。對於該地區暴動事，一般民衆均極重視。</p>
<h3>華北決定　防水對策</h3>
<p>北京一日中央社電　華北本年度防水對策，已於六月廿一日由華北政委會常務會議決定根本方針，自七月一日至九月十日間，佈置縝密之防水工事，以期防水之萬全，故特成立防水委員會總會，以朱深氏任委員長，並於北京天津濟南保定石門太原開封等七市設置防水委員會分會，隸於總會。該防水委員會總會幷以建設總署及日本軍部日大使館等各機關關係官員組織幹事會，附屬於委員會內，担常側面之推進工作。又於華北各要地殷置雨測量量所河川水量測量所等機關，以求萬全之措置云。</p>

<h3>收回滬公共租界　日各報之評論</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社　電　昨日此間讀　報知新聞社評以交還上海公共租界爲題，論述如次：歐洲列强於中國國土內設立之特殊權益中，使中國最感苦痛者，厥爲租界之存在。此種租界有獨自之行政權、課稅權，警備權，及司法等權，成爲國家內之國家。此種租界之最複雜最大者，即爲上海租界上海有公共租界及法國租界，此二者即成爲歐美列强侵略中國之基地及其政治陰謀之策源地，若收囘粗界、乃中國民族運動主要目的之一。大東亞戰爭既爲大東亞全體之解放戰，常然包含中國之解放與獨立，故擊滅英美·協力國府收囘租界，實爲大東亞戰之一目的。日本於本年三月三十日國府還都紀念日之際，即首先交還天津漢口等專管租界，茲更本援助中國之決心，實施交還上海公共租界，將公共租界交還國府，此舉係日本實踐援助中國之諾言。過去掌握上海公共租界實權之英美勢力，至今業已廓淸。預料今後各關係國家，亦將與日本採同一方針。故自中國而言，上海租界收同後，歐美之侵略，可劃一終止符號，於實質上中國之實力，當可加强，過去上海之複雜行政現象，即可芟除。今後上海市之發展意義期待國府得日本之協力，將大上海完全收囘，當使此大上海更生爲復興中國之大據點，負有大東亞中心基地之重大任務。</p>
<h3>蔡大使　訪青木大臣</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　我國駐日大使蔡培氏以收同上海公共租界協定，於卅日簽字竣事，爲對友邦日本之好意表示謝意起見，特於一日下午二時赴日大東亞省及外務省訪問靑木重光兩大臣致謝，幷作種種懇談云。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾預言　秋季前將有大戰　警告人民勿作過分樂觀　天空攻勢謂將加緊進行</h3>
<p>里斯本一日中央社電　據倫敦消息：邱吉爾首相昨日在倫敦演說，預言在秋季之前，地中海及他處皆將有大戰。首相又警告人民勿作過分之樂觀，渠稱，「軍事行動首先受冒險及命運之支配，絕不宜過於自信，凡屬海陸兩方大戰，必須經長時間之組撤，尤其是需要兩個國家以上合作之戰爭爲然，余今日所能言者，爲秋季落葉之前，地中海及他處極有發生大戰之可能」。首相在演說中曾謂，英國在此次戰爭中，絕不接受任何妥協。首相並提及軸心潛艇在五月份之損夫，又謂英國在六月份所建之船，已超過被軸心淸艇所擊沉者，對德義兩國空襲亦將加緊云。</p>
<h3>軸心國在地中海　仍握有制空權　足爲英美侵歐重大障碍</h3>
<p>柏林一日中央社電　海通社空軍訪員齊伯林宣稱：英相邱吉爾所發表秋末以前地中海及其他各處將有激戰一語，適在地中海空戰形勢轉變之時，蓋當突尼西亞初被佔領之時，祇有英美對義大利發動之片面空軍攻勢。但最近局勢已變，軸心空軍現又開始採取攻勢矣。駐北非之英美軍隊在增採與供應方面今日遭逢之困難，正與以前軸心軍所遭遇者相同，運交阿爾及爾及突尼西亞反軸心軍之經濟，必須經過西地中海軸心潛艇及飛機最活躍之地，護鬥機爲掩護，但仍不時偽德義飛機所擊沉。自班泰勒里亞島被佔以來、英美艦船之被擊沉者爲數不少，此項船舶之損失，一方面表示德義在地中海握有制空權，另一方面則爲英美侵歐計劃之重大阻碍。</p>
<h3>直港動態　船艦往來頻繁</h3>
<p>瑪特里一日中央社電　據海通社拉里尼亞消息：直布羅陀港仍有熱烈之軍事活動。昨有商船二十五艘之護航隊。離港駛向地中海方面。同時又有一同樣之護航隊，自大西洋方而駛來，各船皆滿載軍用品，每船船員約百人，該護航隊係由强盛之英艦隊保護。現時在直港下椗者有英戰鬥艦「納遜波」號及「羅特納」號，航空母艦「可畏」號。曁英驅逐艦十二艘。法驅逐　兩艘。昨日下午有英驅逐艦三艘及英潛艇一艘，自地中海駛抵直港。</p>
<p>瑪德里一日中央社電　據阿合西勒消息：停泊在直港之一萬二千噸貨船一艘，昨日發生大火，自遠處亦可望見火燄。</p>
<h3>荷蘭前綫　戰事又呈緊張　蘇軍進攻三次終未得逞　塞港已成爲軸心國要塞</h3>
<p>柏林一日中央社電　德國新聞社東綫軍事訪員稱：星期二日之東綫戰事，皆屬局部性質。庫彭橋頭方面，德擲彈兵曾在監湖區內數度猛攻，並完全將蘇陣地數處予以破壞，蘇兵多名被俘或陣亡，蘇軍預備隊之反攻已被擊退，攻佔之陣地均己併入德方陣綫。庫彭橋頭之附返區域，有蘇軍一隊企圖渡河。但甫經發動即被發　，德砲隊以準確之射擊，將渡船四艘予以擊沉。諾伏羅西斯克區域，曾有蘚偵察隊，藉人造霧之掩護前進，但未得手，即被德山戰部隊所擊退。庫彭河口之河面上，曾有蘇汽艇兩艘被德海岸砲隊所迫同、其中一艘中彈起火。唐納資中部岸上之德砲隊，砲轟蘇軍陣地甚爲收効，曾有蘚聯砲位三座爲之寂然無聲。中部戰區德砲隊轟擊維里基魯基區及維里許附近之蘇軍集中地點，迫使蘚軍放棄其重集隊伍之計盡。北區之戰事活動，亦以德砲火活動爲主要，長距離砲曾擊中蘇聯軍需列車，使其出軌並起火燃燒。芬蘭戰綫方面，蘚軍數度在洛希區進攻德軍陣地，戰事頗爲激烈，蘇軍雖努力進攻，但未能突破德軍之鐵絲網障碍，德方重武器曾予蘇軍以重創，蘇兵四中隊完全殲滅。芬軍亦在附近區域予蘇軍以損害。蘚軍企圖奪同日前失去之陣地毫無效果，蘇軍進攻三次，委棄大批死傷而退。</p>
<p>柏林一日電　據海通社訉，塞伐斯托波爾港今已成爲軸心國在黑海西部之要塞，與東部之庫彭橋頭堡壘遙遙相對。人民觀察報稱，塞港今已恢復要塞面目，以防蘇聯進窺克里米亞及烏克蘭，並以之爲奪取韃靼尼爾之跳板。塞港之德駐軍，對不論來自海上式陸上之敵軍，均已完成迎敵之準備。</p>
<h3>斯達林允與羅邱會晤</h3>
<p>里斯本一日中央社電　海通社訉，英國交換電訉社駐華盛頓訪員稱，斯達林已接受美總統之建議，與邱吉爾約期會晤，據云，美前駐蘇大使台維斯自莫斯科携同之密封函中，即表明此項接受之意，會晤日期及地點則尙未決定。</p>
<h3>布拉克夫繼任　遠東紅軍司令</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　海通社訊：蘚聯已委任布拉克夫將軍爲遠東紅軍總司令。原任司令阿班納生柯將軍已調任他職，布拉克夫以前曾任駐德軍事參謀。</p>
<h3>反軸心空軍暴行　科隆古敎堂被炸毀　德人憤慨聲言必施報復</h3>
<p>柏林一日中央社電　德國新聞社昨據可靠方面消息。截至一九四三年五月廿三日爲止，德國共有敎堂一百三十三座毀於炸彈，又有四百九十四座受損甚重。科隆一地已有敎堂三十一座完全坍毀，其中若干皆具有一千餘年歷史。</p>
<p>柏林一日中央社電　德國科隆大敎堂被反軸心空軍轟炸後、其盲炸之非行，可謂已達極點，德國民對此，均決意予以報復。消息方面會於六月二十九日透露，德方將組織空軍報復部隊，謂英美兩國欲以濫施轟炸即可使德國民喪失戰意，此實乖謬，蓋德國民對其神經戰術毫不動搖，其非人道之暴行，反引起德國民之激憤，及至廿八日晚轟炸德人最崇拜之科隆大教堂，國民憤激已達極點。</p>
<p>羅馬一日中央社電　此間昨晚獲悉：西里之叙拉庫斯大敎堂，曾遭英美飛機自低空襲擊而致重損。該敎堂建於紀元前五世紀，原爲多里斯族之廟宇，於公元六四〇年改爲敎堂。</p>
<p>敎皇電德表示惋惜</p>
<p>羅馬一日中央社電　海通社訊：教皇庇護士十二世曾致電與柏林之聖使，表示渠對於科隆大敎堂之被炸毀，深感不安、並令駐柏林聖使代向科隆敎堂當局轉致教皇惋惜之意。自科隆敎堂被　後，敎廷駐德代表已將約略情形報告梵蒂岡，一俟損毀之詳細報告製成。即當送呈敎廷。梵蒂岡人士素以科隆敎堂與米蘭大敎堂相比，當敎皇庇護十二世尙在柏林任聖使時，曾稱，該教堂爲聖彼得堂以外敎會所最寶貴之建築物。</p>
<h3>德魯爾區　疏散婦孺</h3>
<p>柏林一日中央社電　海通社訊紅十字會火車已開始撤退魯爾區之婦孺及老年人，每列車可載四百人及其全部行李，車中均載有國社黨福利會之護士及軍醫隨同照料，每列車更附掛軍用廚房，携全程所需之食物與俱，撤退者如需嬰孩衣服及乳瓶，均可請管理人發給。</p>
<h3>英美的食糧問題（二）</h3>
<p>英國</p>
<p>第一次世大界戰時的英國首相勞合，喬治在一九三七年對政府警告稱：「前次大戰中英國最瀕於崩潰的危機之戰綫者，實爲食糧戰綫。德國，奧國，保加利亞，俄羅斯之所以敗北者，亦因缺乏食糧之故，在他們屈膝之前，英國也幾乎倒下了。」然而這警告並朱驚醒了滿足於依賴海上支配及殖民地的英國支配階級之偷安的迷夢。此次戰爭勃發後、英國的食糧政策，依存於海外輸入及貯藏的維持，國內的食糧增產，僅用以爲其補充，或僅備作不時之需。這狀態繼續了二年之久，這期問，感到國內食糧增產的必要，雖屢經提出各種方式的提案，但張伯倫內閣一向不擬加以眞切的考慮。他們把這戰爭看得稀鬆平常，祇要英國海軍俾全，儘可以食用從海外運來的食糧。然而一九四一年被潛水艦擊沉的船　日見增加，因歐洲戰綫的擴大及大東亞戰爭的爆發，深切地感到船舶不足的痛苦。英國不能不開始舉其全力來增產國內食糧。農相彼得生，糧食相鳥爾頓的名字，時常在報紙上出現。</p>
<p>然而一世紀以來，被追求利潤的資本主義當作繼子看待而日趨沒落的英國農業，一旦而能恢復足供這大戰　需要的生產性，那眞是奇蹟，過去二年間，英國唯知從軍事方面凖備，對食糧增產尙在夢中，這奇蹟暫時不　得會實現。</p>
<p>英國第一　增產對策是開發　地計劃。因此用一筆開發獎勵基金派遣所謂「農業軍隊」至各地，並提高農產物的價格以保證農業利潤。其結果，據官方的統計，從一九三九年的一千三百萬英畝增加至一九四二年的一千八百萬英畝。即在此四年問耕地擴張了五百萬英畝。英國的耕地面積，自一八七一年起即趨减少，至一九三九年電從一千八百萬英畝减落至一千三百萬英畝，現在所擴充的，也不過是恢復原狀而已，不能說是怎樣大的增加。可是比人口在此期間却從二千六百萬增加至四千六百萬，而且英國耕地的大部分是用作栽培家畜用的飼料及其他，用於耕種殺物的耕地，例如在一九三九年，不過二八％。何况英國農產物的價格，其統額二億七千萬磅中的十分之七爲家畜及家畜關係的農產物，且總其家畜用飼料的大部分，亦爲從外國輸入的東西。某英國經濟理論家曾嘆息說：「英國的農業是小企業，英國農民已經忘掉了農事了。」</p>
<p>政府在這裏急起直追，擴充小麥的耕地，於是預擬在本年據充小麥的新耕地六十萬英畝，今年預定擴充一百萬英畝。英國農業是否能適合這新事態，實是主要的問題。</p>
<p>第二個增產對策是促進農業機械化。大戰前的曳耕機總數稱有五萬二千具，現在則增加至十二萬具。可是無論其怎樣促進機械化，英國農業的基礎，是否具備利用這些機械的條件，不無疑問。英國農業就全體看來，乃是百萬人以上參加生產的一大資本主義的企業，內部的構造及技術的水凖，在英國尙是未發達的部門。經營農地的大部是五十英畝以下者，八十五％乃是一百五十英畝以下的小經營者。這些小經營平均有農榮勞働者三人至四人，用低級的技術，更無融通資金的門路，完全被支配於敎會和銀行家等大土地所有者。所以大量增加曳耕機，並提高農產物價格，而即大吹爲「如其大量生產，就綽有餘裕了」，這些小經營對之，似不見有何興味。（里斯本茂木特派員二十日電。翔：譯自六月二十三日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>公共租界　行政機構檢討</h3>
<p>上海公共租界。最初蘭　時，爲英國租界，根據土地章租，組織公共租界行政機構，茲就其與大東亞戰爭後之租界行政比較如次：</p>
<p>市參事會</p>
<p>公共租界之最高行政機關爲市參事會，過去以十四人組成，以國籍別之，則中國五人，英國五人，美國二人，日本二人，自大東亞戰爭爆發，英美方面已完全退出，現在則爲中國三人，日本三人，德國一人，及瑞士一人，在昔英國以擁有市　事會員五人，故常把持市參事會議長之席，其工部局內重要位置，百年來，亦完全由英人所占。關於租界行政，英美始終因利害衝突時生猛烈鬥爭，然英方則常獲勝利，故租界之行政，完全依英國之意旨支配，工部局殆成爲英國之行政機關。且最堪注目者。即土地章程問題。根據其修正規定，必須得公使團及中國政府之承認，然土地章程附則中規定並不經中國政府承認，僅經領事團或公使團及外人納稅會承認，市參事會即得任意決定實施，然此附則不僅與土地章程有同等效力，且直接對於一般市民之生活，亦有極大影響，市參事會之權限，在該章程上雖設有納稅人會議之監督制度，然實際出席納稅人會議者頗少，且出席之人，對於討議案件，亦極不熱心，故成爲市參事會之獨裁行政權，當時　爲民衆所實難。</p>
<p>專門委會</p>
<p>市參事發爲完全執行屬於其管理之事務，得隨時自參事會員中任會認爲　當之委員，因此而設立專門委員會，此項委員會內分財政委員會，人事委員。公共事業委員會。衛生委員會。敎育委員會。等，自大東亞戰爭勃發後。更設立民防空委員會。產業社會事業委邑會。保甲委員會。物資統制委員會。等，而完全發揮其機能。</p>
<p>工部局</p>
<p>在市參事會支配下：執行實際事務者，爲工部局，其行政事務本僅限於修築租界道路，建築家　及公　之設計等，其後漸决管理各方面之行政事務，着改換類似管理全部行政之名稱，恐遭中國人士猜疑，故迄今仍冠以工部局之名稱。工部局之職員，戰前約有七千人，其中外人佔一千人，高級戰員多係英美兩國人，工部局依土地章程規定，乃受市參事會議長之支配，實則乃實行三位一體之政治，即除市麥事會議長外，尙有總務局總長及總務局長，各部局之負責人均爲英人，故已喪失公共租界之意義，實陳上殆已完全化爲英國租界。</p>
<p>納稅人會</p>
<p>納稅人會議，爲租界行政之決議機關，其所用職員，須有一定資格，此等職員，有選舉市參事會會員之權利，至市參事會委員之被選舉資格或納枕人之選舉資格，須視作不當之規定，即須富有財產，因此，參事會會員中，有半數以上，竟皆英美籍人，受領事團及外交國之監瞥。事實上，通去租界當局完全採取獨立行動，以上乃上海公共租界之概觀。故縱謂過去之上海租界爲英國之駐外關係，亦非過言。於此自不難想像彼方如何以租界爲根據地，而榨取中國，故租界實爲中國史上百年來之一大汚點，但今日本已首先淸算敵人英美迫中國所訂之不平等條約，而將租界交還中國。</p>
<p>經濟界　譯論</p>
<h3>經濟施策的綜合化</h3>
<p>日本對華新政策實施以來，關於確立中國自主經濟機構的工作，進行相當順利，已有了相當成果。商統會與食糧聯營社的組織等，也已整頓就緒，在不久的將來，可望有劃時期的進展，然而我們對此，總還免不了有杞入之憂，率直的說，唯恐這些組織及其活動，會陷於孤立的危險。</p>
<p>舉具體的事實來說，例如要求商統會組織的圓滑運用，完全發揮其性能，則至少須與金融統制的各項施　保持充分協調。假使兩者的施策缺乏聯繫的話，那麽商統會的機構仍不能發生效力。</p>
<p>採辦機構和配給機構的運用，也要使他息息相通。要是採辦歸採辦機構，配給歸配給機構，這種機械化的辦法，是得不到偉大效果的，調產交流物資，既然如此困難則放出物資，就不得不格外愼重。現在的採辦配給關係上，有無這種準備呢？任何物資，即使如一疋布，也都不應無關係而隨便放出。由於這種觀點，則採辦配給的綜合化，實不得不予以深切的考慮。（摘譯大降新報）</p>
<h3>留日工人考選會　已組織成立　實現中日人力交流</h3>
<p>爲適應大東亞戰事需要。實行中日人力交流，本市中日工商界人士。特組織留日工人考選會，由上海市商會·日本商·會議所·上海工商聯誼會·大陸新報及申報五社團主辦中華留日技術工人考選事宜，該會經多時之籌備，始行成立，委員人選中國方面爲聞蘭亭·袁履登。林康侯。陳紹嬀。陳日平·吳桓如·陳彬龢，日本方而爲靑木節·武內文彬·船津辰一耶·波多博·小室健夫·尾坂與市·吉田東祐，均爲本市工商界知名之士，關於考選技工。該會規定三項重要原則：</p>

<h3>金融業重視生產　實行低利貸放</h3>
<p>自國府宣佈實施戰時經濟政策綱領以來，產生全國商業統制總會，內部組織機構及下部各業聯合會委員會及同業工會之統制機構，大致完全調整就緒，即日開始實行商業自主的統制工作。茲悉該會除注重蒐買配給運銷之統制制度外，尤着重於如何增加生產，現本市各金融機關，在中儲銀行指導之下，努力投資農貸，其貸放生產資金之利率問題，使生產事業，得能充分進展，聞最近小麥貸款利率，由中儲放予中交兩行爲七釐，中交兩行放出則爲八釐，又交通銀行之農貸，其屬於農業增闍行莊一分之下，屬於個人發展農業者，大致在一分二釐，其較市塲利率，均低落遠甚，預料將來農業生產，必有宏大教獲。</p>

<h3>租界交還後之　滬市經濟　稻登垣氏談話</h3>
<p>公共租界工部局物資統制處長稻垣登，頃以「租界交還及上海經濟之今後」爲題嗚發表談話。要旨如次：一，自公共租界交還後，國府之一切經濟施策，更可順利實施，同時中國之戰時經濟體制，亦得迅速强化促進。二·以往欲實施强度的統制經濟施策，因工部局所有之法的權力，非常薄弱，故中日兩當局之指導政策，在實際上亦有隔靴搔癢之憾，租界交還後，此種遺憾即可完全消滅。三，由其他方面而論，租界之畸形繁榮，茲已逐漸消退。所謂因戰爭暴富色彩，茲已歛跡，然若謂此係租界經濟之衰微現象，則係大誤，實爲過渡至健全繁榮不得已之現象，租界交還後，以往之半自由的經濟，必將改革，其實今日正爲改革之最良好時機，此則有望於爲政者之決斷奧經濟人之覺醒也。四，商統會與市政之關係，非常密切，因之如不得市政之保護與援助，則商統會之施策決不能獲得充分效果，事　明顯。五，交還租界對於民衆全無不良影響，如糧食問題，物價統制問題，民生物資配給問題等施策。均得澈底推進，故毋甯可謂益將好轉。六，要之如有正確把握以上理念滅私奉公之爲政者，及積極獻身公益之經濟人互相融和合作，則明動上海，當可建成。</p>

<h3>日商工會議所召開　十一次定期議員大會　青木會長致詞</h3>
<p>上海日僑商工會議所，於三十日假座日本俱樂部，召開第十一次定期議員大會，首由靑木會長致辭，旋即開始議事，幷由事務局報告去年度事業概况，及決算帳略，並照原案通過去年度剩餘金處置辦法，茲將靑木會長演辭內容錄誌於次：</p>
<p>囘顧去年度，中日關係，固不待言，即中國自身，或本會議所方面，實亦係所謂波瀾迭起，頗多變動之一年，就中日經濟關係而言，堪以持筆大記者，爲去年十一月一日大東亞省之創設，及本年一月九日日本對華外交之大轉變，並因此而逐漸展開之對華新經濟政策之確立。大東亞省之創設，其目的乃在統一帝國在華機關之多頭性，實現施策之一元化，實不待言，同時亦在希望解決中日關係，尤其經濟分野方面之障礙，以確立中日之本然關係，且爲本年一月九日日本對華外交轉換之先驅，實堪重視之歷史的事實也。中日關係之全面調整，因本年一月九日，日本對華外交之大轉變嗚而開始踏上實現之第一步，在經濟方面，以全國商業統制總會，以及最近即將實現之中國貿易聯營總會爲中心，新經濟政策。正逐漸具體推進，據本月十五日東條首相在第八十二屆臨時議會發表演說，日本政府。計劃更進百步以求中日條約之根本改訂，此與近將實行之上海公共租界之交還等。同爲中日兩國關係，行將飛躍猛晋之明證，凡此種種，均爲一年以前夢想所不及，如此英　雄偉之施策，其所及於政治。經濟。外交。文化，以及對華政策，並在華日僑之直接間接影響，均極重大。因爲吾人夙所熟知者，吾等財界人士，爲確立中日新關係決不融犧牲，積極完成國策。茲須特別强調者，本年一月以來，逐漸展開之日本對華外交經濟政策之轉換。決非係日本由中國後退之意，其目的乃在確立中日共存共榮之永久體制，並非係日本由中國之經濟的後退，蓋日本轉變對華經濟政策之目標，乃在復與中國之經濟，樹立中國新經濟體制，以實現共同理想，欲理解目前之中國經濟情形，及將來中國經濟必有之眞實姿態，則必須有如左之二個要件：第一，中國經濟以大東亞戰爭勃發爲一區期，質的方面，已由質易中國轉變爲生產中國，同時不得不由依存歐美經濟轉變，爲束亞共榮經濟，此種事實，須予明確認識，第二中國向被稱爲歐美之决殖民地，經濟方面，依賴歐美，極爲深刻，今已完全截斷，故其　體產業革命，以及推進產業革命的變化，實爲自有大道，此種必然性，亦應加以確實認識，若非循從產業革命的構想，則中國經濟之自存，及中國之近代國家經濟化，斷無法完成。因之外交轉換後之日本對華並在華各種經濟政策，概加以過密計劃，以適合此種大目標，而同時亦必須遵照此種方針，而加以推進，茲如稍予且體的闈述新經濟政策之方向，則至少有左開各點，堪以注意。第一先確立建設大東亞共榮圈之共同目標，第二由向來極易發生之鬥爭的對立的性格，躍進爲協同合作之途。第三澈底認識中國經濟之復興，爲中日其榮之基本，尤以中國經濟中　神經之上海財界之積極協力。爲不可缺少之要件。第四足以滿足以上要求之新經濟政策之轉變，由道義及政治方面，因不待論，即經濟方面、亦屬可能，中日認識，業已一致。此項原理，並非純係理論，對華新經濟政策具體表現之全國商業統制總會之組織及實踐，業已付諸實施，此爲金融工業商業交易農業等方面，即經濟全分野之共同要求，同時亦爲政治的外交的要求，在某種意味，並包括有軍實事要求，爲實施對華經濟施策之際，不可稍或忽之重要原則。當復興新中國經濟之際，對於以上各種原理，及中國經濟之產業革命性，必須予以淸晰認識，此爲復興中國經濟之最大　基本的要求，上海爲中國經濟之中樞神經，上海經濟如不能復興，則中國經潛之復興。實無希望，故建設上海經濟，即稱爲復興中國全經濟，亦非過言。本會議所，最近曾設立經濟上海建設委員會。賴各位以及各界權威人士，予以協力，積極加以檢討，此會與中日問題委員會，日商對策委員會，係屬三位一體，努力建設上海經濟，所以如此者，全國建設上海經濟，有如此重要性故也，更移轉目光於中國以外，則內外之情勢，貿極爲重大，僅就日本而言，現爲確立必勝不敗態勢，正繼續進行血戰，其實際情形由各種決戰經濟政策，及水春之第八十一屆決戰議會，及目前召集之　八十二屆臨時議會，業已充分表現，日本之決戰經濟政策，係集中於鐵煤輕金屬船舶飛機之五大產業，奠定磐石之基，衆所週知，如此堅强之日本決戰經濟體制，因日前第八十二屆臨時議會通渦「企業整備資金措置法案」，而愈益進入鐵壁之整備階段，即據岸商相在議會說明該法所規定之企業整備，與以往因物資不足而採取之企業整備性質不同，在此次之企業整備，實爲「因增產戰力而實施之企業整備」也。因之此决之整備，非若以往單注力於輕工業之整理統合。廣及於產業，全分野之所要部份，將各所要產業，就其性質，區分爲開工保有轉用休廢以圖達到下列各種目的，而完成充分之整備：（一）設備之轉用，（二）勞工之配給於重要產業方面，（三）屑鐵之收囘，此爲擊減英美所不可避免的要求，此際對於吾等在滬財界所認爲重要之事件，乃此種日本國內之企業調整，對於中國經濟，亦有重大關係，據岸商相在議會說明：「中國方而，現注重於在華紗廠之恢復與補充。此外保有設備之第二决第三次移駐亦積極推進」云，即輕工業之對華移駐，現正積極計劃，在中日綜合計劃之下，建設新中國經濟之新時代，卒已到來，吾等在滬之財界人士，深感其使命與責任乏愈益重大。日本之決戰經濟現正進向必勝體制，更在中日經濟全面合作之下，上海經濟建設進展可期，日本在大積威之下，賴皇軍將士之善謀勇戰，與一億國民之鞏固團結，愈益確立必勝不敗之堅陣，吾等國民，唯有表示感激而已，同時對殉國英靈，及皇軍將士，衷心表示謝意，並誓以前綫將士之心爲心，愈益奮發中日提　，以完成時局之重貴云。</p>

<h3>我們需要的通俗文學</h3>
<p>— 東方</p>
<p>我國的文學，已由艱澀難懂的文言，而進入通俗易懂的白話文，這使文學普遍地展開到各個階級層。本來，通俗文學擁有大量的讀者是必然的，因爲多數的讀奢是智識較爲低落的中下階級。寫得深奧艱澀，只能給少數人去硏究和玩味，通俗易懂才是大衆所歡迎的。</p>
<p>怎機才算通俗易懂呢？要定這個標凖，先得看所寫的是什麽，不能籠統決定。譬如所寫的果文學作品。那麽得就「文學」來定好懂的標準，文學的創作，完全是具體的形象的描寫，這裏得拋棄那些不明不白的幻想，拋棄那些病態心理的曲折，不用深奧抽象的名詞，要寫實，要直接明快的表現現實。在文學創作上。能夠這樣做，大抵都可以達到「容易懂」和通俗化的目的。</p>
<p>理論文章就顯得較爲困難，這裏不能避免各種難懂的學術名詞和新名詞的應用。而且，理論文章的目的在灌輸讀者一些理論，一些貫串在個別事件根底裏的普遍法則，需要正確的概念，正確的名詞。所以，不能避免而必須要用到各種不容易懂的學術上的名詞和新名詞。</p>
<p>爲炫耀新奇而故意用新名詞的作者縱然有，但這並不多。大部分似乎還是不能夠充分活用，致把名詞弄成生硬而難懂。要把一篇理論文章寫得通俗淺易，並不在於拋棄一切名詞的應用。應該努力的活用名詞，這才是正確的道路。因爲通俗化的目的，一方面固然要使大衆懂，一方面也要灌輸給大衆一些更豐富的智識和科學的字　，而提高大衆的程度。所以，我們所需要的通俗文學：創作方面，要大胆而明白的寫出現實，避免不切要的幻想和描寫。和抽象名詞的應用：而寫理論文章，則必須活用名詞，用淺顯的解釋，使它生動而易懂。</p>
<h3>把握現在</h3>
<p>— 杰穎</p>
<p>在現在這個時期，每個人都體味到現在的生活是太困苦了。於是就有許多人囘憶着過去。過去的一切在他們的心目中都是十分的美麗，十分的甘甜；同時也有着許多人在夢想着將來，夢想將來曾給他們快樂幸福。</p>
<p>可是，「往者不可追，來者未可憑。」囘憶夢想都又有什麽用呢？過去的一切都已成了過去，過去已不再會囘到現在來。而將來將來又在何處呢？將來又憑那一點是一定快樂幸福的呢？</p>
<p>將來，這將來正寓在現在之中，現在的一分。秒漸漸地成爲過去，而將來的一分一秒也正漸漸地來到現在。過去的是完了，死了；而將來呢？將來是活的。可是也是虛的。唯有這現在是實的，是眞的，我們要快樂，要幸福；囘憶。夢想都不能供給我們些什麼。唯有現在。在現在努力纔能創造出快樂，幸福來。</p>
<h3>想和做</h3>
<p>— 聞天</p>
<p>「想」和「做」之間，要保持着密切的聯繫，不可分離得太遠，只「想」不「做」，是近於「夢幻」；只「做」不「想」，將流於「妄行」，「夢幻」與「妄行」是不能成就任何事業的。</p>
<p>「腦」要淸淸楚楚，「手」要勤勤懇懇，各盡各職，融洽合作，任何艱巨困難都可打破而獲得成功。</p>
<p>行事爲人能以公衆的利益爲前提，安於自己的良心做指針，則不致爲非作　，顛倒黑白，而受人唾罵了，</p>
<p>不輕視別人，也不必把別人看得太重，不誇　自已，也不可把自己估量過低。</p>
<p>成敗得失，置之度外，項天立地，俯仰無愧，有膽識，不猶豫，則天下無不可爲之事。</p>
<h3>評「回春曲」</h3>
<p>— 陸光</p>
<p>非常榮幸地見到「囘春曲」的公演，在荒蕪的藝境，這是一個良好的收獲，從「囘春曲」可以明白地知道中國電影有着光輝的前途、因爲老的是老了，不中用了，而新的呢？眞是「後生可畏」</p>
<p>「囘春曲」叙述一個藝人從事劇運的經過，自始至終。有現實性，因此在極濃厚的人情味之下，每個畫面都深深地打動了歡衆的心坎，後半部從劉瓊酒醉踞足起，那沉重的情調，更顯示了那可憐的藝人的遭遇。不幸！</p>
<p>劇中有戲中串戲，先後以話劇舞台面，表演了「茶花女」，「羅米歐與朱麗葉」，及「囘春曲」，因爲演員們都有舞台劇的經騐，所以演出之優　，是全片最精彩的片段，同時剪接簡潔，絕無拖泥帶水之弊。</p>
<p>如果要找出缺點的話，那麽給束的地方，有商討的必要、因爲電影總究是藝術品。不能過份遷就「生意」，大團圓等已消失在時代的進展中，</p>
<p>劉建的演技，無懈可擊，胡楓也突破已往的紀錄，田鈞本望他多多努力！佈景燈光等都可批上數十分。</p>
<h3>影城散記</h3>
<p>「歌衫情絲」於上月二十七日至杭州拍攝外景，梅熹童芷齡等一行人馬。浩浩蕩蕩，西子湖畔，生色不少。「新生」開拍後，工作極爲緊張，導演高梨痕日夜工作，副導演　磊因忙而致病。</p>
<p>岳楓新作生死刦，劇本業已通過，並於二十五日起在第一廠趕搭佈景。二十八日正式開拍，男女主角原定高占非與　美雲，現因高袁另有新作，故已改由舒適胡楓合作。</p>
<p>朱石麒繼良宵花弄月之後的作品，是第二代，男女主角決定，由劉瓊，呂玉堃，嚴俊，等主演，近日朱石麟正在趕寫劇本，將繼新生後在四廠開拍</p>
<p>何兆璋新作「桃花潭水」，業已在二廠開拍，主角爲周曼華嚴化徐立。</p>
<h3>鷄</h3>
<p>— 沈沈</p>
<p>「一定不肯的！我辛辛苦苦，飼養到今天，才會生蛋，我不肯的！」秀寶更是堅決地嚷着：</p>
<p>「他媽的！不行！我們司令要吃鷄，怎麼可以違侖！不要說吃你們的鷄，就是要你們的命，也不能違抗！快！快！要躭誤我的公事！」這個穿灰布衣的小傢伙，直截爽快說出非要不可的話。」</p>
<p>「求你老爺照應吧！我們的生蛋鷄，實在靠牠過日子的。我願意把家裏的幾個蛋送給你，求你老爺照應吧！」阿坤以哀憐的口吻求饒。終於不肯把這靠着過活的鷄攘奪去，堅執着，攔阻着？</p>
<p>「好！不肯就不肯！等着顏色看！」這個穿灰布衣的，悻悻然地表示不樂意，逕自去了。</p>
<p>「爸！我的生蛋鷄。怎麼可以白白讓人吃去。明天我們又有四個蛋，可以到手，我想每天留一個蛋，到煞脯（就是鷄停生蛋）的時候，我可以換一件花棉襖料，做好了到新年裏穿，爸！你肯哦！」秀寶如釋重負地，開心得向阿坤嘮叨着。</p>
<p>「哦！好的！』阿坤究竟五十多歲的人，懂得點世故了，他想眼前雖說是太平了，可是「等着看顏色」，總有後禍的。他心裏稍稍有點忐忑不安。</p>
<p>夜飯吃過了，秀寶先去睏。阿坤在一燈如豆的火光下，坐在桌旁對着妻子說：「這年頭××隊眞多，遊來遊去，這番是張部，那番是王部。被頭捐·鞋襪捐·香烟捐·燒酒捐。我們鄉下人弄得焦頭爛額。今天我們們的鷄吃不到，明天說不定還要來的。有什麼話呢！」阿坤的妻。聽了，也不大懂得，默不做聲，跟着嘆了口氣。</p>
<p>崩！崩！崩！阿坤家的前門，忽然敲得很急，接着門外嚷着：「開門！開門！快開！」阿坤很驚慌地，戰慄地，去開門，六七個穿灰布的一擁而入。先頭的一個，就是剛才來捉鷄的小傢伙。</p>
<p>「快說！快交出來！你們家裏有槍！有槍！不是好東四！你們通匪！」來的人七張八嘴。亂噪噪地嚷着。一把拉着阿坤的衣傾，接着耳光，拳頭，像雨點般落到阿坤身上。</p>
<p>「沒……沒沒……沒有槍……槍的！我是種田人，不會通匪的！」阿坤顫抖地訴說着。</p>
<p>「拉到司令部去審問，非重重的責罰，他要狡賴的！去！去！去！」中間有一個灰布衣的這樣說，一面手指着拉緊阿坤衣領的一個。</p>
<p>「先抄查一下！也許把槍藏起來」！另一個說着，於是二三個一擁進阿坤家的臥房，可是阿坤家原來是環堵蕭然，一無衣物破舊的衣服，凌亂的雜物，一切都不値得他們光顧。僅有一串銀索子，一個銀鎖片，是秀寶的婆家，定親時送過來的。總算給他們賞識而帶去了。</p>
<p>「去！去！到司令部去審間！」於是牽着阿坤的衣領，呼嘯去了。（二）</p>

        <h1>1943.07.02</h1>
<h3>We Anticipate August 1st</h3>
<p>—And Hope the French Government Will Swiftly Make a Clear Statement</p>
<p>August 1st, the August 1st we are anticipating, will be the day when the Republic of China begins to realize its complete sovereignty, the day when the ideal that the people of the whole country have been yearning for day and night for a century will be realized! Because according to the agreement signed in Nanjing on June 30 this year between China and Japan for the return of the Shanghai International Settlement, the Shanghai settlement, a base that has damaged our country's sovereignty for a century, will be officially returned by Japan! This is a summary of China's century of humiliation, and at the same time, it is the beginning of a glorious history of Sino-Japanese cooperation in building a new East Asia. However, today, we still cannot but feel regret that the French government has not yet made a clear statement on the promise to return the French Concession in Shanghai, that is to say, at a time when our friendly nation Japan is earnestly fulfilling all its promises to respect our country's complete sovereignty, the French government has not yet determined the date for the return of the concession. This is obviously a shadow in the minds of the Chinese people and in the eyes of the international community, and we hope that the French government can quickly dispel this shadow!</p>
<p>The existence of the French Concession is also a great humiliation in the minds of the Chinese people. Now that the International Settlement has been returned due to Japan's friendly cooperation, only the French Concession continues to exist. We believe that this will leave a bad impression on China and its people by the French government, which will be impossible to eliminate, and will not be a blessing for Sino-French relations. From the country's standpoint, it is indeed as Mayor Chen of our city said: "If the administrative power of the French Concession is not returned for a single day, the administration of Shanghai will still not be complete, and the administration of China will not be complete." This will inevitably lead to serious obstacles for China, which is moving towards independence and autonomy. Therefore, we hope that our government will quickly conduct concrete consultations with the French authorities and urge the French government to fulfill its promise. We look forward to the realization of the return of the French Concession in Shanghai by August 1st at the latest, as Premier Wang has said.</p>
<p>From the perspective of French interests, after careful consideration, we feel that there is no need to delay the return of the French Concession at all. On the contrary, it should be returned quickly. France today is in a very difficult situation and is also moving towards a new life, seeking to restore its past glory and rebuild its important position in the international arena. The first step is to establish international prestige, fulfill its promises to China, and return the Shanghai Concession, and to achieve this by August 1st at the latest. This will not only greatly enhance the prospects of Sino-French relations, but also the feelings between the Chinese and French people. From the current international situation, the righteous people of the world are preparing for a decisive battle to defend truth and defeat Anglo-American hegemony. France, which has the glory of three revolutions, will naturally be an important member in this great decisive battle and will not want to abandon its divine duty. Therefore, in order not to let Japan monopolize the limelight, it should quickly implement the return of the Shanghai Concession to show its determination to cooperate in promoting justice. This is not only the expectation of China and the nations of East Asia, but also the common expectation of every righteous person in France.</p>
<p>For the sake of this glorious day of August 1st, which is not only the prelude to the future international morality and new order of China alone, we hope that the French authorities will take a long-term and broad view, and implement the return of the French Concession in Shanghai at the same time on August 1st, and hope that the Italian government and others can emulate Japan and make similar statements one after another! So that China's complete sovereignty can be fully realized, and China can achieve success in the process of independence and autonomy. This is not only China's glory, but also the glory of all friendly nations! Therefore, we look forward to August 1st, which is the beginning of the construction of a new East Asia and a new world order!</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Turkey Firmly Adheres to Neutrality</h3>
<p>After the end of the North African war, Britain and the United States raised the banner of invading Europe and, as usual, used the old trick of intense psychological warfare, making great publicity through radio, news, and the activities of the Fifth Column. Turkey has always been used as good material for propaganda. Since the Axis forces withdrew from Tunisia, various sensational news about Turkey has been spread. For example, "Turkey has decided to abandon its neutral attitude and adopt a non-belligerent attitude," or "Turkey has decided to open the British and American Soviet routes through the Dardanelles Strait," or "Turkey will soon join the war on the side of Britain and the United States," or "British and American air forces will bomb Romanian oil fields from Turkish air bases," and so on. Recently, while traveling to and from Berlin, this reporter briefly stayed in various Balkan capitals such as Sofia, Bucharest, and Budapest. The people I came into contact with there seemed particularly concerned about Turkey. Needless to say, if Turkey is engulfed in war today, it will inevitably spread to the Balkans immediately. That is why the Balkan countries pay special attention to Turkey's movements. When judging the current situation, the observations of people in the Balkans seem to be more sensitive than those of us in Turkey. I felt like I was wearing very strong tinted glasses there.</p>
<p>Therefore, we cannot but recognize the truth that the enemy is using Turkey's name for propaganda in the Balkans. The arguments heard in the Balkans are probably all the enemy's fabrications or something similar. In response to this propaganda, the entire Turkish nation only hopes for the preservation of its own country. Therefore, it will absolutely not enter the war voluntarily. Britain and the United States are indeed paying considerable attention to strengthening the military in the Balkans. The intention of Britain and the United States to instigate Turkey is not to make Turkey have direct military cooperation in the war against the Axis powers, but to prepare for future or potential events.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the eyes of Britain and the United States, Turkey's value lies not in seeking military cooperation. If Turkey stands on the side of Britain and the United States, it is only being used as a means of "posing" against the Axis powers. In the eyes of Britain and the United States, Turkey has not yet reached the point where it can be of great use.</p>
<p>Britain and the United States have already fully utilized Turkey as a means of "posing." However, the tension in the Balkan countries today is not only focused on Turkey. They anticipate that the enemy will attack in Thrace, Greece, and along the Adriatic coast, and are therefore considering contingency plans.</p>
<p>As for Turkey itself, it remains extremely calm, and the deployment of troops seems to be the same as before. No new mobilization seems likely to be implemented. Since mid-May, Turkish warships have deployed a maze, and the lights of the Black Sea coast and the Bosphorus Strait lighthouses have been extinguished, which has attracted considerable attention. But isn't Turkey taking a precautionary measure to avoid getting caught in the crossfire, anticipating that the Mediterranean war is about to come?</p>
<p>Therefore, no large-scale military activities are about to occur in Turkey. Economically, taxes have only been increased a few times to maintain military spending, and prices also tend to rise. However, the expression of the people is extremely calm, trusting the repeated statements of government officials to maintain neutrality. The possibility of Turkey joining the war is not a daily topic for the general public. (Sho: Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun, June 28)</p>

<h3>Imperial General Headquarters Announces Battle Situation in the Rentaba Island Area: Imperial Army Air Force Demonstrates Power</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 5:30 PM on the 1st: (1) On the morning of June 30, a strong enemy force consisting of transport ships, cruisers, etc., was discovered in the Rentaba Island area of the Solomon Islands, and part of it landed on the island. (2) The Imperial Navy Air Force has bombed the above-mentioned enemy forces several times, sinking or destroying a total of six transport ships, three cruisers, and one destroyer, and shooting down a total of 31 enemy planes. (3) The Imperial Army and Navy forces in the area are continuing to fight in close cooperation.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to military experts here, Japan and the United States have been engaged in fierce battles in the South Pacific since August of last year. During this time, the Japanese Navy Air Force in the area has not allowed the enemy to make any moves, and any moves by the enemy have been crushed by the Japanese army, especially since the air battle in Longa Bay. The battle situation has become even more intense. Japan and the United States are both fighting with all their might, and the future battle situation is not difficult to imagine. On the morning of June 30, the United States suddenly appeared south of Munda Island in New Guinea. At that time, a transport fleet composed of more than a dozen ships was escorted by cruisers and destroyers, and a strong air force was on alert in the sky. More than 100 landing craft landed from the north to south coasts of Rentaba Island, about 10 kilometers south of the western coast of New Guinea Island. After the Japanese air force discovered them, it immediately took the opportunity to launch a large-scale surprise attack, broke through the enemy fighter formation, and heavily bombed the enemy transport fleet, sinking or destroying six enemy transport ships, three cruisers, and one destroyer. It achieved tremendous results. However, part of the enemy forces have already landed, so the Japanese Army and Navy forces in the area are currently engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy. It is expected that the Japanese army will thoroughly annihilate the powerful American operations.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – On the morning of June 27, anti-Axis aircraft, including mutual-type bombers, Douglas bombers, Northrop bombers, and Curtis fighters, totaling 50 aircraft, attacked Kolombangarra Island. Eight were shot down by Japanese anti-aircraft guns. On the afternoon of June 28, anti-Axis aircraft, consisting of a joint formation of 68 fighter-bombers, including unified "B24" type, Curtis "P40" type, and Douglas "FBD" type, attacked Isabel Island. The Japanese ground forces immediately countered, resulting in the shooting down of three "FBD" types.</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Bomb Darwin Harbor Vigorously</p>
<p>Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to an anti-Axis bulletin relayed from Melbourne: Japanese bomber formations, under the escort of fighter planes, attacked Darwin Harbor again yesterday, as well as Milne Bay in New Guinea. The damage and casualties suffered there were quite extensive. The bulletin stated that six anti-Axis aircraft were shot down during the aerial combat over Darwin Harbor.</p>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) – German News Agency military reporter Hans Ribbentrop declared: The recent Japanese army's aerial attacks on the military facilities of Darwin Harbor in northern Australia may be a harbinger of new developments. Japan, an allied country in East Asia far from the European battlefield, is now taking decisive action, as can be seen in the recent heavy bombing of Darwin Harbor. This is the first large-scale operation of the Japanese Army Air Force. From this fact, it can be judged that Japan's offensive against Australia has made very good progress, and a major undertaking may be imminent, or it may be the beginning of a new stage in the Pacific War.</p>
<h3>Chairman Wang Visits Suzhou to Participate in the Second Anniversary of the Pacification Campaign; Suzhou and Wuxi Hold Grand Celebrations</h3>
<p>Suzhou, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Supreme Leader, Chairman Wang, in view of the fact that the pacification work originated in Suzhou, made a special visit during the second anniversary of the pacification campaign. This is his fifth inspection of the pacified area, and his fourth visit to Suzhou. Accompanying personnel included Chen Chunpu, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Ye Peng, Minister of the Army, Zhou Jiangxiang, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chen Changzu, Lieutenant General Adjutant to the National Government, Zhai Manyun, Director of the Executive Yuan Pacification Affairs Bureau, and the two friendly Japanese, Chaisan and Teraoka. The Chairman departed from the capital at about 4 PM on the 30th. When passing through Zhenjiang, Yuan Shu, Director of the Zhenjiang Area Pacification Campaign, received orders from Governor Li to board the car and accompany him. Along the way, many people from various counties held flags to welcome him. The special train arrived in Suzhou at 7:49 PM. Governor Li, along with civil and military officials, greeted him at the station. After the Chairman alighted from the train and exchanged greetings with Governor Li and other welcoming personnel, he entered the city in a special car. Along the way, people held flags and shouted "Long live Chairman Wang!" The situation was extremely enthusiastic. Upon arriving at the headquarters, Governor Li led the directors of various departments and the magistrates of various counties to pay their respects in shifts. At 8:20 PM, Governor Li held a banquet for the Chairman at the headquarters. That evening, the Chairman also issued a declaration for the second anniversary of the pacification campaign. At 8:30 AM on the 1st, the Chairman listened to Governor Li's report at the headquarters. From 8:55 AM to 9:55 AM, he listened to the reports of the stationed friendly Japanese generals. At 1:00 PM, the Chairman personally visited the Pacification Memorial Hall in Gongxiang and attended the Jiangsu Province Third Anniversary of the Pacification Campaign Celebration Conference.</p>
<p>Chairman Wang Delivers an Address</p>
<p>Suzhou, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Supreme Leader, Chairman Wang, personally attended the second anniversary celebration of the pacification campaign in Suzhou Province today and delivered an address. All the attending representatives listened respectfully and were greatly inspired. The key points of the Chairman's address are respectfully recorded as follows: The pacification work began on July 1, 1941. During the first anniversary of the pacification campaign last year, I said that the purpose of the pacification work is first to promote national peace and cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. Now, on the occasion of the second anniversary, our country has already participated in the Greater East Asia War in order to strive for the revival of the Chinese nation and the liberation of East Asia. Over the past two years, we have received much assistance from our friendly nations, as well as the efforts of our pacification work colleagues and the people. I would like to express my deepest respect and gratitude here. Since the beginning of the pacification work, only ten counties in Jiangsu were initially designated to be held first, which means that a small part of the region should first be used as a model for the whole country. Now the pacification work will spread throughout the country. The pacification campaign in Suzhou Province has continued from the first phase to the fourth phase, and has expanded to the southeastern region of Lake Tai, the Zhejiang region, and the Shanghai region. The pacification work has been successively launched in Hubei, Anhui, Guangdong, and other provinces. The North Jiangsu region has also returned to Jiangsu due to the pacification campaign. Therefore, the scope of the current pacification work is vastly different from its beginning. Therefore, the Pacification Committee has changed its structure due to factual needs, because the pacification work is general, not special, and permanent, not temporary. However, in the past, some people thought that the pacification work only needed to be the responsibility of the Pacification Committee. In fact, the pacification work must be done by the whole country, and all departments should supervise and cooperate together. The division of the pacification work to the Executive Yuan is also meant to be this way. China is an agricultural society and has not yet entered an industrial society. The purpose of the pacification campaign, as the name suggests, is to focus on the countryside, because farmers are the producers of China. Since the Greater East Asia War is a long-term war, the most important task in our country is to increase production. To increase production, we must first protect the producers with all our strength. If the countryside is stable, the farmers will be able to cultivate with one heart and one mind, so that the harvest will be abundant, contributing to the Greater East Asia War and guaranteeing social security, which is also to guarantee the safety of the producers. With all my heart, I offer a heartfelt blessing to the second anniversary of the pacification campaign.</p>
<p>Chairman Wang's Declaration</p>
<p>Suzhou, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Supreme Leader, Chairman Wang, in view of the fact that the pacification work originated in Suzhou, made a special visit during the second anniversary of the pacification campaign, and issued the following declaration for the second anniversary of the pacification campaign: This month's 1st is the second anniversary of the Jiangsu Pacification Campaign. I have come to Suzhou today to offer my heartfelt prayers. In the two years since, I have inspected the pacification zone five times, and each time I have felt there was progress. Thanks to the generous assistance of the friendly military authorities, and the untiring efforts of Governor Li and his subordinates, we have been able to achieve these results. I would like to express my deepest respect here. Tracing back to July 1, 1941, the beginning of the pacification campaign, it was based on the national policy of peace, anti-communism, and nation-building; and last year, it further progressed to contributing to the Greater East Asia War during the Greater East Asia War, fulfilling the responsibilities of the rear, so that the soldiers on the front lines of the Greater East Asia War would have no worries about the rear; and this year, it has further participated in the Greater East Asia War, from the spirit of sharing weal and woe, to sharing life and death. At this time, the so-called pacification work, such as guaranteeing social security, should pay attention to the purpose of protecting Chen’s social security. In maintaining the order of the rear of the Greater East Asia War; such as increasing production, we should pay attention to the purpose of production, so that the needs of the Greater East Asia War can be constantly supplied from the rear. From this point of view, to guarantee social security, we must cherish and guarantee those who guarantee social security, such as soldiers, police, and civil servants; to increase production, we must cherish the producers, such as farmers and workers, so that we can show each other the spirit of love and sincerity, and put into practice the solidarity of sincerity. Those who want to love their country will love their neighbors, and those who love East Asia must love each other as each and every person. To guarantee social security and increase production, in the near future, is the purpose of the pacification campaign; in the long term, the significance of participating in the Greater East Asia War also lies in this. I would like to offer my best wishes to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the people with the meaning of reviving China and defending East Asia. And I would like to wish the second anniversary of the pacification campaign, giving the national policy of peace, anti-communism, and nation-building, and participating in the Greater East Asia War, the greatest significance and expectations. Wang Zhaoming, July 1.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) – Chairman Wang made a special visit to Suzhou on the occasion of the second anniversary of the pacification campaign in Suzhou Province.

<p>Suzhou, 1st (Central News Agency) – Since the National Government implemented the pacification work in the Jiangsu region two years ago, thanks to the guidance and leadership of Chairman Wang and Governor Li, and the great cooperation of the people, there has been significant progress in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture. On the occasion of the second anniversary on the 1st of this month, Suzhou held the following grand and enthusiastic events to express its celebration: 1. A new national gymnastics competition was held at 8:00 AM, with the unanimous participation of primary and secondary schools in the provincial capital. 2.

<p>Wuxi, 1st (Central News Agency) – Today is the second anniversary of the pacification campaign in Suzhou Province. All sectors of the city, because the pacification work has been very effective, held a grand celebration ceremony today. All shops in the county hung flags to mark the occasion. At 9:00 AM, a mass rally was held in the public execution ground in the city. Representatives from various agencies and organizations, as well as thousands of people, attended the ceremony, which was solemn and enthusiastic. A telegram was sent to Chairman Wang and the Governor of Suzhou Province to express their respects. After the rally, the team set off for a parade through the bustling streets inside and outside the city, which did not disperse until noon. A variety show started at 2:00 PM to show that they were sharing the joy with the people. It was held in the park and divided into two sessions, day and night. The audience was packed and the situation was unprecedented. In the evening, representatives from various agencies in the city gathered for a joyous banquet.</p>
<h3>Materials Control Deliberation Committee Establishes Office in Shanghai; Organization of Materials Countermeasures Committee Abolished</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Materials Control Deliberation Committee is the highest deliberation organ for handling materials control. In order to strongly perform its duties, the committee plans to establish an administrative bureau and a Shanghai office. All organizational regulations and important candidates have been resolved and passed by the Executive Yuan meeting. As for the Central Price Countermeasures Committee previously established by the National Government, since its duties are the same as the current Materials Control Deliberation Committee, there is no need to establish it again. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to forward the organizational regulations and organizational outline of the Central and Local Price Countermeasures Committees to the National Government for formal abolition.</p>
<h3>Secretary Matsudaira Broadcasted Last Night</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) – Secretary Matsudaira of the Japanese Embassy in China gave a radio speech on the 1st at the Central Broadcasting Station, entitled "Thoughts on the Recovery of the Shanghai International Settlement."</p>
<h3>Revolt Occurs in Gansu; Hu Zongnan Appointed Commander of Suppression</h3>
<p>Beijing, 1st (Central News Agency) – Gansu Province, located in the northwest region, is now an important northwest stronghold of the Chongqing side. However, a large-scale anti-Chiang revolt suddenly occurred in the province under the instigation of a political secret society. The Chongqing side's work of developing the northwest region has therefore been suspended, causing a great blow to the strength of the war of resistance. In January of this year, 8,000 Hui Muslims in Lintao County, south of Lanzhou, suddenly revolted in resistance to Chongqing's administration. Thereupon, the political secret society Gelaohui, which has hidden power in the northwest region, took the opportunity to rise up and incite the revolt. They advocated overthrowing Gu Zhenglun, Chairman of the Chongqing Gansu Province, gathering more than 100,000 people. Led by Ma Fupu, formerly of the Hui Muslim army of Ma Buqing, they formed eight detachments of the "Fushan National Salvation Army." They gradually expanded their power, and by March, they occupied the city of Linxia. In April, they appeared from time to time on the Xilan Highway, attacking and burning Chongqing's liaison vehicles and civilian cars, and occupied major counties in Gansu Province such as Lintao, Yuzhong, Lintan, and Dingxi. By early May, they had cut off the transportation between Lanzhou and Xi'an, and the situation had expanded. The Chongqing side initially paid little attention to it, but was greatly alarmed at this point, and appointed Hu Zongnan, commander of the 34th Army Group of the Chongqing side, as the commander-in-chief of the suppression, in order to quell the revolt by force. Zhu Shaoliang, commander of the 8th War Zone of the Chongqing side, was ordered to be responsible for pacification and recruitment, but there is still no hope of quelling this revolt, and the situation seems to be expanding day by day.</p>
<p>Beijing, 1st (Central News Agency) – A pro-Chiang revolt suddenly broke out in Gansu Province. Tens of thousands of Hui Muslims, under the command of the Gelaohui, led by the Hui Muslim general Ma Fushan, have captured various key areas of the Minshan Mountains (from the southern part of Lanzhou to the Sichuan Province border, and the central part of Gansu Province in the north) and are confronting the Chongqing army that has been dispatched to suppress them. Although this rebel army is ostensibly guided by the Gelaohui, judging from the way it conducts propaganda to the masses, or the communist guerrilla tactics it adopts when occupying various Chongqing government agencies, and the fact that the Chongqing army forcibly blockades the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border area whenever a revolt occurs, it can be seen that there must be communist troops secretly active within it. The general public attaches great importance to the revolt in the area.</p>
<h3>North China Decides on Flood Prevention Measures</h3>
<p>Beijing, 1st (Central News Agency) – The fundamental policy for this year's flood prevention measures in North China was decided by the standing committee meeting of the North China Political Affairs Committee on June 21. Meticulous flood prevention works will be arranged from July 1 to September 10 in order to ensure complete flood prevention. Therefore, a flood prevention committee general meeting has been established, with Mr. Zhu Shen as the chairman. Flood prevention committee branch meetings have been established in seven cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Jinan, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, and Kaifeng, subordinate to the general meeting. The flood prevention committee general meeting has also organized a secretariat composed of relevant officials from various agencies, such as the General Construction Department, the Japanese military, and the Japanese embassy, attached to the committee, to be responsible for the day-to-day promotion work. Rain measurement stations and river water volume measurement stations have also been established in various key areas of North China to seek comprehensive measures.</p>
<h3>Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry Announces Personnel of the Embassy in China</h3>

<h3>Comments from Japanese Newspapers Regarding the Return of the Shanghai International Settlement</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) Telegram: The "Hochi Shimbun" here published an editorial yesterday titled "The Return of the Shanghai International Settlement," stating the following: Among the special rights and interests established by European powers within Chinese territory, the one that causes the most pain to China is the existence of the settlements. These settlements have their own administrative, taxation, police, and judicial powers, becoming states within a state. The most complex and largest of these settlements is the Shanghai Settlement, encompassing both the International Settlement and the French Concession. These two have become bases for European and American powers to invade China and the source of their political conspiracies. Retrieving the settlements is one of the main goals of the Chinese national movement. Since the Greater East Asia War is a war of liberation for all of Greater East Asia, it naturally includes the liberation and independence of China. Therefore, defeating Britain and the United States, cooperating with the National Government, and retrieving the settlements is one of the goals of the Greater East Asia War. On the occasion of the National Government's return to the capital on March 30 of this year, Japan first returned the exclusive concessions in Tianjin and Hankou. Now, further demonstrating its determination to assist China, it is implementing the return of the Shanghai International Settlement, handing it over to the National Government. This action is Japan fulfilling its promise to aid China. In the past, the real power in the Shanghai International Settlement was held by British and American forces, but this influence has now been completely eliminated. It is expected that other related countries will also adopt the same policy as Japan in the future. Therefore, from China's perspective, after the Shanghai Settlement is retrieved, the invasion by European and American powers can be brought to a complete end, and China's strength can be substantially enhanced. The complex administrative phenomena of Shanghai in the past can be eliminated. Looking ahead to the future development of Shanghai, it is hoped that with Japan's cooperation, the National Government will completely retrieve Greater Shanghai, transforming this metropolis into a major base for the reconstruction of China, shouldering the significant task of being the central base of Greater East Asia.</p>

He also engaged in various cordial talks, it is said.</p>
<h3>Churchill Predicts Major War Before Autumn, Warns People Against Overly Optimistic</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency) Telegram: According to London sources, Prime Minister Churchill stated in a speech in London yesterday, predicting that before autumn, there will be major wars in the Mediterranean and elsewhere. The Prime Minister also warned the people not to be overly optimistic, saying, "Military actions are first governed by risk and fate, and should never be overconfident. Any major war on land and sea must be organized over a long period of time, especially wars requiring the cooperation of more than two countries. What I can say today is that before the leaves fall in autumn, there is a high possibility of major wars occurring in the Mediterranean and elsewhere." In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that Britain would never accept any compromise in this war. The Prime Minister also mentioned the losses of Axis submarines in May and said that the ships built by Britain in June had exceeded those sunk by Axis submarines. He also stated that air raids on Germany and Italy would be intensified.</p>
<h3>Axis Powers Still Hold Air Supremacy in the Mediterranean, Significant Obstacle to Anglo-American Invasion of Europe</h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) Telegram: Maritime News Agency Air Force correspondent Zibelin declared: British Prime Minister Churchill's statement that there would be fierce battles in the Mediterranean and elsewhere before the end of autumn comes at a time when the air war situation in the Mediterranean is changing. When Tunisia was first occupied, there was only a unilateral air offensive launched by Britain and the United States against Italy. But recently, the situation has changed, and the Axis air force has now begun to take the offensive. The difficulties faced today by the Anglo-American forces stationed in North Africa in terms of reinforcement and supply are the same as those previously encountered by the Axis forces. The transport of supplies to the anti-Axis forces in Algiers and Tunisia must pass through the most active area of Axis submarines and aircraft in the western Mediterranean. Fighters provide cover, but they are still frequently sunk by German and Italian aircraft. Since the occupation of Pantelleria Island, a considerable number of Anglo-American ships have been sunk. The loss of these ships indicates that the German and Italian forces hold air supremacy in the Mediterranean, and it is a significant obstacle to Anglo-American plans to invade Europe.</p>
<h3>Gibraltar Port Dynamics, Frequent Ship Traffic</h3>
<p>Madrid, 1st (Central News Agency) Telegram: According to Maritime News Agency's Larinia dispatch: There is still intense military activity in the port of Gibraltar. Yesterday, a convoy of twenty-five merchant ships left the port and headed towards the Mediterranean. At the same time, another similar convoy arrived from the Atlantic Ocean, all ships fully loaded with military supplies, with approximately one hundred crew members on each ship. The convoy was protected by a strong British fleet. Currently anchored in the port of Gibraltar are the British battleships "Nelson" and "Rodney," the aircraft carrier "Courageous," and twelve British destroyers. Two French destroyers are also present. Yesterday afternoon, three British destroyers and one British submarine arrived at Gibraltar from the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Madrid, 1st (Central News Agency) Telegram: According to Algeciras sources: A 12,000-ton cargo ship docked in Gibraltar caught fire yesterday, and the flames could be seen from a distance.</p>
<h3>Netherlands Front, Tension Rises Again, Soviet Attacks Thrice Unsuccessful, Sevastopol Port Becomes Axis Fortress</h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) Telegram: A German News Agency correspondent on the Eastern Front reports: The fighting on the Eastern Front on Tuesday was local in nature. In the Kuban bridgehead area, German grenadiers launched several fierce attacks in the marsh area, completely destroying several Soviet positions. Many Soviet soldiers were captured or killed, and a Soviet reserve counterattack was repelled. The captured positions have been incorporated into the German front line. In the area around the Kuban bridgehead, a Soviet unit attempted to cross the river. However, they were discovered as soon as they launched the attack, and German artillery accurately sank four of their boats. In the Novorossiysk area, a Soviet reconnaissance team advanced under the cover of artificial fog, but was repelled by German mountain troops before they could succeed. On the river near the mouth of the Kuban River, two Soviet motorboats were forced to retreat by German coastal artillery, one of which was hit and caught fire. On the central bank of the Donets River, German artillery effectively bombarded Soviet positions, silencing three Soviet artillery positions. In the central war zone, German artillery bombarded Soviet concentration points near Velikiye Luki and Velizh, forcing the Soviet army to abandon their plans to regroup. In the northern sector, the main activity was German artillery fire. Long-range artillery hit a Soviet supply train, causing it to derail and catch fire. On the Finnish front, Soviet forces launched several attacks on German positions in the Lokhi area. The fighting was fierce, but the Soviet forces failed to break through the German barbed wire obstacles. German heavy weapons inflicted heavy casualties on the Soviet forces, completely annihilating four Soviet companies. Finnish troops also inflicted damage on Soviet forces in the nearby area. Soviet attempts to retake positions lost in recent days were unsuccessful. The Soviet forces attacked three times, abandoning large numbers of dead and wounded before retreating.</p>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Telegram): According to Maritime News Agency, the port of Sevastopol has now become an Axis fortress in the western Black Sea, facing the Kuban bridgehead fortress in the east. The People's Observer newspaper states that the port of Sevastopol has now been restored to its fortress status to prevent the Soviet Union from invading Crimea and Ukraine, and as a springboard to capture the Taman Peninsula. The German garrison stationed in the port of Sevastopol has completed preparations to defend against enemy forces, whether from the sea or land.</p>
<h3>Stalin Agrees to Meet with Churchill</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency) Telegram: Maritime News Agency reports: A British Exchange Telegraph Agency correspondent in Washington stated that Stalin has accepted the US President's proposal to meet with Churchill at a mutually agreed time. It is said that the sealed letter brought by former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Davies, from Moscow indicated this acceptance. The date and location of the meeting have not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Bulganin Succeeds as Commander of the Far East Red Army</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) Telegram: Maritime News Agency reports: The Soviet Union has appointed General Bulganin as Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Red Army. The former commander, General Apanasenko, has been transferred to another position. Bulganin previously served as a military attaché in Germany.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Air Force Atrocities, Cologne Cathedral Destroyed by Bombing, Germans Angered, Vow Retaliation</h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) Telegram: The German News Agency reported yesterday, based on reliable sources: As of May 23, 1943, a total of 133 churches in Germany had been destroyed by bombs, and another 494 had been severely damaged. In Cologne alone, 31 churches have been completely destroyed, some of which have more than a thousand years of history.</p>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) Telegram: After the bombing of Cologne Cathedral by the anti-Axis air force, the atrocity of indiscriminate bombing has reached its extreme. The German people are all determined to retaliate. Sources revealed on June 29 that the German side would organize an air force retaliation unit, saying that the Anglo-American belief that indiscriminate bombing could cause the German people to lose their will to fight is a fallacy. The German people are not shaken by their psychological warfare tactics, and their inhuman atrocities have only aroused the indignation of the German people. The national outrage has reached its peak with the bombing of Cologne Cathedral, the most revered church by the German people, on the evening of the 28th.</p>
<p>Rome, 1st (Central News Agency) Telegram: It was learned here last night that the Syracuse Cathedral in Sicily had been severely damaged by a low-altitude attack by British and American aircraft. The cathedral was built in the 5th century BC, originally as a Doric temple, and was converted into a church in 640 AD.</p>
<p>Pope Expresses Regret to Germany in Telegram</p>
<p>Rome, 1st (Central News Agency) Telegram: Maritime News Agency reports: Pope Pius XII sent a telegram to the Holy See in Berlin, expressing his deep concern about the destruction of Cologne Cathedral and instructing the Holy See in Berlin to convey the Pope's condolences to the Cologne Church authorities. After the bombing of Cologne Cathedral, the Vatican's representative in Germany reported the general situation to the Vatican. Once a detailed report of the damage is prepared, it will be submitted to the Holy See. Vatican officials often compare Cologne Cathedral to Milan Cathedral. When Pope Pius XII was still serving as the Holy See in Berlin, he called the cathedral the most precious building of the Church outside of St. Peter's Basilica.</p>
<h3>Evacuation of Women and Children from the Ruhr Area</h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) Telegram: Maritime News Agency reports: Red Cross trains have begun evacuating women, children, and the elderly from the Ruhr area. Each train can carry 400 people and all their luggage. The trains are accompanied by nurses and military doctors from the National Socialist Welfare Organization to provide care. Each train also has a military kitchen attached, carrying all the necessary food for the entire journey. Evacuees who need baby clothes and feeding bottles can request them from the administrators.</p>
<h3>The Food Problem of Britain and America (2)</h3>
<p>Britain</p>
<p>Lloyd George, the British Prime Minister during the First World War, warned the government in 1937: "During the last war, the war front that brought Britain closest to collapse was the food front. Germany, Austria, Bulgaria, and Russia were defeated because of a lack of food. Britain almost fell before they surrendered." However, this warning did not awaken the complacent dream of the British ruling class, who were satisfied with relying on maritime dominance and colonies. After the outbreak of this war, Britain's food policy relied on overseas imports and the maintenance of storage, with domestic food production only used to supplement it or as a backup in case of emergency. This state continued for two years. During this period, although the necessity of increasing domestic food production was repeatedly raised in various forms of proposals, the Chamberlain Cabinet consistently refused to give it serious consideration. They took this war lightly, believing that as long as the British Navy was intact, they could eat food transported from overseas. However, in 1941, the number of ships sunk by submarines increased daily. Due to the expansion of the European front and the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, they deeply felt the pain of ship shortages. Britain had no choice but to begin to put all its efforts into increasing domestic food production. The names of Agriculture Minister Peterson and Food Minister Woolton frequently appeared in newspapers.</p>
<p>However, for British agriculture, which had been treated as a stepchild by profit-seeking capitalism for a century and was declining daily, it would be a miracle if it could suddenly recover the productivity needed for this great war. In the past two years, Britain had only prepared militarily and was still dreaming about increasing food production. This miracle will not be realized for the time being.</p>
<p>Britain's first major production increase measure was the land development plan. Therefore, a development incentive fund was used to dispatch the so-called "agricultural army" to various places, and the prices of agricultural products were raised to guarantee agricultural profits. As a result, according to official statistics, the cultivated area increased from 13 million acres in 1939 to 18 million acres in 1942. That is, during these four years, the cultivated land was expanded by five million acres. The area of cultivated land in Britain had been decreasing since 1871, falling from 18 million acres to 13 million acres in 1939. The current expansion is only a restoration of the original state, and cannot be said to be a large increase. However, the population during this period increased from 26 million to 46 million, and most of Britain's cultivated land is used to cultivate feed for livestock and other purposes. For example, in 1939, only 28% was used for cultivating grains. Moreover, of the total value of British agricultural products, 270 million pounds, seven-tenths were livestock and livestock-related agricultural products, and most of the feed for livestock was also imported from foreign countries. A certain British economic theorist once lamented: "British agriculture is a small business, and British farmers have forgotten farming."</p>
<p>The government is now catching up, expanding the wheat cultivation area. It is planned to expand the new wheat cultivation area by 600,000 acres this year, and 1 million acres are planned for expansion this year. Whether British agriculture can adapt to this new situation is a major question.</p>
<p>The second major production increase measure is to promote agricultural mechanization. The total number of tractors before the war was said to be 52,000, and now it has increased to 120,000. However, no matter how much mechanization is promoted, there is doubt as to whether the foundation of British agriculture has the conditions to utilize these machines. From the perspective of the whole, British agriculture is a large capitalist enterprise with more than a million people participating in production. The internal structure and the level of technology are still underdeveloped departments in Britain. Most of the farms are operated by those with less than 50 acres, and 85% are small operators with less than 150 acres. These small operations average three to four agricultural laborers, use low-level technology, have no access to financing, and are completely dominated by large landowners such as churches and bankers. Therefore, even if the number of tractors is greatly increased and the prices of agricultural products are raised, and it is boasted that "if there is mass production, there will be more than enough," these small operations do not seem to be interested.

<h3>North China Relief Association Held Regular Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai All Circles North China Relief Association held its fifth executive committee meeting at 4 PM yesterday in the auditorium of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. Those in attendance included Wen Lanshi, Yuan Lvdeng, Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, Sun Mingqi, Guo Shun, Zhuang Yunqing, Chen Binhe, Xiang Kangyuan, Li Tianzhen, Chen Dongbai, etc. Yuan Lvdeng chaired the meeting.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>First, the chairman reported on the donation situation for the past week (from June 25 to June 30), and the fundraising progress in various circles. The association has now received a total of RMB 4,525,098.30 in donations (according to reports from various collecting banks).</p>
<p>Discussion of Proposals</p>
<p>The discussion of various proposals then began, including: (1) For the venues of various charity sales and performances, the association will send personnel to supervise the copying of the accounts. Whether the venues have turned in all the funds to the designated collecting bank and how to verify and organize the matter for a resolution. It was resolved: Send a letter to the venues of the various charity sales and performances, requesting them to report the receipt number of the funds turned in to the bank to the association, and to urge them to quickly settle any uncollected funds. (2) Previously, the association notified the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Joint Chamber of Commerce to forward letters to various guilds to encourage donations for emergency relief. Apart from a few reports to the association, the rest should be re-emailed for a resolution. It was resolved: Send a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Joint Chamber of Commerce to request them to find ways to expedite the collection. (3) Whether the association should set up a procurement team for the purchase of food to be solely responsible for the procurement, for a resolution. An explanation was attached: The purchase of miscellaneous grains was previously referred to the Joint Chamber of Commerce to handle through the Miscellaneous Grain Industry Guild. However, the process of repeated requests and entreaties not only wasted time, but also failed to assign responsibility, which would be more effective if a procurement team were added. It is proposed to appoint a leader from the Miscellaneous Grain Industry to take charge, which is easy and efficient. Whether this is feasible is submitted for a resolution. It was resolved: To postpone the establishment, and to appoint two design committee members to take charge of procurement and transportation.</p>
<p>Buddhist Association Fundraising</p>
<p>The Buddhist Association and other organizations in this city responded to the North China drought relief efforts by establishing the Shanghai Buddhist North China Drought Charity Relief Association on June 8 to plan for relief. After deciding on a fundraising target of 600,000 yuan, donations were enthusiastic, but the amount still fell far short of the target. It is still necessary for Buddhists in this city to continue their efforts to recognize donations and solicit donations based on the principles of compassion and generosity, so as to gather more strength, so that the disaster victims in North China can receive more benefits. In addition to the Jing'an Temple office, the association's collection point also has the Jinkang Bank on Museum Road as an agent for collection.</p>
<p>Shen Bao Cup Charity Donation</p>
<p>The Shen Bao Cup North China charity donation received by this newspaper yesterday included: the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Department Store Industry Association: 1,000 yuan, Ding Jiwan: 400 yuan, for a total of 1,400 yuan in reserve certificates. The remaining balance is 192,500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Prosecutor's Office Changed to Procuratorate, Shanghai Court Ordered to Handle</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Judicial Administration recently decided to expand the procuratorial system. After receiving orders from the various courts in this city, they had already prepared in advance and simultaneously announced the establishment of the Procuratorate starting yesterday morning. All Chief Prosecutor titles have been changed to Chief Procurator. Those belonging to the urban area are called the Shanghai Local Procuratorate, Chief Procurator Ma Chang. The French Concession is called the Second Special District Local Procuratorate, Chief Procurator Shen Wenjie. The International Settlement is called the First Special District Local Procuratorate, Chief Procurator Zhang Zongru. At the same time, the Shanghai Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court also divided the procuratorial powers. The International Settlement is called the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Procuratorate, Chief Procurator Hu Yigu. The French Concession is called the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Procuratorate, Chief Procurator Shen Wenjie.</p>
<h3>Wang Weisheng Takes Over as Shanghai Postal Administration Director</h3>
<p>After the resignation of the Shanghai Postal Administration Director, Zhapailin, Wang Weisheng, the assistant to the director, was promoted and formally took office yesterday, without holding a ceremony.</p>
<h3>Grain Procurement and Sales Office Ordered to Close and Hand Over</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Food has ordered the Shanghai Office of the General Administration of Grain Procurement and Sales to be abolished, and all affairs are to be handled by the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Food. It is learned that after the office was ordered to close, it has submitted all documents to the Ministry of Food and handed them over to the Shanghai Office for handling.</p>
<h3>Fourth Phase Oil for Both Settlements to be Sold Soon, Special Sugar Allotments to be Distributed Continuously</h3>
<p>The fourth phase of oil sold by household based on house donation tickets in both settlements and the northern districts has been processed for pick-up by the Edible Oil Wholesale Office. A portion has been distributed to the various oil firms and then to the various retail oil shops, and is expected to be sold soon within days. The quantity, price, and methods are the same as the previous phase.</p>
<p>In addition, the fourth phase of household sugar in this city began to be sold universally on the 26th of last month, with a deadline of the 7th of this month. As for the special allotments of sugar required by various industries for business purposes, they have also been distributed successively. However, due to procedural relationships, businesses in various industries must immediately process the exchange of vouchers, pay the money, and pick up the goods after receiving the notification slip from the office. A burlap bag fee of 100 yuan per bag must also be paid.</p>
<h3>Public Concession: Review of Administrative Structure</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Public Concession. Initially, during the period of Land Regulations, it was a British concession. Based on the Land Regulations, a public concession administrative structure was organized. The following is a comparison between its administration and that of the concession after the Greater East Asia War:</p>
<p>Municipal Council</p>
<p>The highest administrative organ of the Public Concession was the Municipal Council. In the past, it was composed of fourteen members, divided by nationality as follows: five Chinese, five British, two American, and two Japanese. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the British and American representatives have completely withdrawn. Now, it consists of three Chinese, three Japanese, one German, and one Swiss member. In the past, Britain, with five council members, often controlled the position of the chairman of the Municipal Council. Important positions within the Public Works Department (工部局) have also been entirely occupied by Britons for a century. Regarding the administration of the concession, the British and Americans consistently engaged in fierce struggles when their interests clashed. However, the British often prevailed, so the administration of the concession was completely dominated by British intentions, and the Public Works Department (工部局) almost became a British administrative organ. Most noteworthy is the issue of the Land Regulations. According to the revised provisions, approval was required from the diplomatic corps and the Chinese government. However, a supplement to the Land Regulations stipulated that it did not require approval from the Chinese government; only approval from the consular body or diplomatic corps and the foreign taxpayers' meeting was needed for the Municipal Council to arbitrarily decide and implement. This supplement not only had the same effect as the Land Regulations but also had a significant impact on the lives of ordinary citizens. Although the regulations provided for a system of supervision by the ratepayers' meeting over the powers of the Municipal Council, in reality, very few people attended the ratepayers' meeting, and those who did were not enthusiastic about the matters discussed, resulting in the Municipal Council's autocratic administrative power, which was difficult for the public to bear at the time.</p>
<p>Specialized Committees</p>
<p>To fully implement matters under its administration, the Municipal Council could appoint committee members at any time from among the council members whom it deemed appropriate, thus establishing specialized committees. These committees were divided into the Finance Committee, Personnel Committee, Public Works Committee, Health Committee, Education Committee, etc. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, committees such as the Civil Defense Committee, Industrial and Social Welfare Committee, Baojia Committee (保甲委員會), and Materials Control Committee were also established, fully utilizing their functions.</p>
<p>Public Works Department (工部局)</p>
<p>Under the control of the Municipal Council: The Public Works Department (工部局) was responsible for executing practical affairs. Its administrative affairs were originally limited to the construction of concession roads, the design of buildings and public gardens, etc. Later, it gradually decided to manage administrative affairs in various aspects. Fearing suspicion from the Chinese people if it changed its name to something resembling the management of all administration, it still retains the name of Public Works Department (工部局). Before the war, the Public Works Department (工部局) had about seven thousand employees, of which about one thousand were foreigners. Senior members were mostly British and American. According to the Land Regulations, the Public Works Department (工部局) was under the control of the Chairman of the Municipal Council, but in reality, it was a trinity of power, consisting of the Chairman of the Municipal Council, the Director-General of the General Affairs Bureau, and the Director of the General Affairs Bureau. The heads of each department were British, thus losing the meaning of a public concession and almost completely becoming a British concession.</p>
<p>Taxpayers' Meeting</p>
<p>The Taxpayers' Meeting was the decision-making body for the concession administration. Its employees had to have certain qualifications and had the right to elect members of the Municipal Council. However, the qualifications for being elected as a member of the Municipal Council or for being a taxpayer were considered inappropriate, requiring wealth. As a result, more than half of the council members were British and American, subject to the supervision of the consular body and diplomatic countries. In fact, the concession authorities in the past acted completely independently. The above is an overview of the Shanghai Public Concession. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that the Shanghai Concession of the past was a British overseas relationship. From this, it is not difficult to imagine how they used the concession as a base to exploit China. Therefore, the concession was indeed a major stain on China's history for a century, but now Japan has first settled the unequal treaties imposed on China by the enemy Britain and America and returned the concession to China.</p>
<p>Economic Circle Translated Articles</p>
<h3>Comprehensive Economic Measures</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of Japan's new policy towards China, the work of establishing China's autonomous economic institutions has proceeded quite smoothly and has already achieved considerable results. The organizations of the Commercial Control Association (商統會) and the Foodstuffs Cooperative Association (食糧聯營社), etc., have also been reorganized. In the near future, epoch-making progress can be expected. However, we still cannot help but worry about this, frankly speaking, fearing that these organizations and their activities may fall into the danger of isolation.</p>
<p>To cite specific facts, for example, in order to smoothly operate the Commercial Control Association (商統會) organization and fully exert its performance, it must at least maintain full coordination with various measures of financial control. If the policies of the two lack connection, then the organization of the Commercial Control Association (商統會) will still not be effective.</p>
<p>The operation of purchasing organizations and distribution organizations must also be closely linked. If purchasing is the responsibility of the purchasing organization and distribution is the responsibility of the distribution organization, this mechanical approach will not achieve great results. If the exchange of resources is so difficult, then the release of materials must be even more cautious. Is there such preparation in the current purchasing and distribution relationship? No material, even a piece of cloth, should be released casually without a relationship. From this point of view, the integration of purchasing and distribution must be given serious consideration. (Excerpt from Da Zhong Xin Bao 大降新報)</p>
<h3>Examination Committee for Workers to Japan Established, Realizing Sino-Japanese Human Resources Exchange</h3>
<p>In order to meet the needs of the Greater East Asia War and implement Sino-Japanese human resources exchange, people from the Sino-Japanese business community in this city have specially organized the Examination Committee for Workers to Japan. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Japanese Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, Continental News (大陸新報), and Shen Bao (申報) five groups jointly organized the examination affairs for Chinese technical workers to Japan. After a long period of preparation, the committee was established. The committee members include Wen Lanting (聞蘭亭), Yuan Ludeng (袁履登), Lin Kanghou (林康侯), Chen Shaowei (陳紹嬀), Chen Riping (陳日平), Wu Huanru (吳桓如), and Chen Binhe (陳彬龢) on the Chinese side, and Aoki Setsu, Takeuchi Fumin, Funatsu Tatsuichi, Hata Hiroshi, Komuro Takeo, Osaka Yoichi, and Yoshida Toyu on the Japanese side, all of whom are well-known figures in the business community of this city. Regarding the examination of technicians, the committee stipulates three important principles:</p>
<p>(1) Anyone who volunteers to work in Japan must pass a technical examination and a physical examination.</p>
<p>(2) The minimum living expenses for family members (based on the price level of the place of residence) will be paid by the Chinese commercial bank designated by the committee twice a month.</p>
<p>(3) When people go abroad, the insurance company established in China designated by the committee will provide insurance for them.</p>
<p>Currently, the first phase of the committee is mainly recruiting skilled carpenters and apprentices who volunteer to learn carpentry (details will be published in various newspapers tomorrow). The office is temporarily located on the fourth floor of the Xingya Building (興亞大樓) at 12 Bund, Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce.</p>
<h3>Two Cultural Groups Telegraph Congratulations on the Return of the Concession</h3>
<p>To Chairman Wang Jingwei (汪精衛) of the Nanjing National Government: We are delighted to learn that our friendly nation, Japan, has returned the Shanghai Public Concession and has already signed an agreement with our government. After hearing the news, we are extremely excited. For a hundred years, Britain and America have used the concession as a base to deprive us of our rights and restrict our freedom, which we speak of with hatred. Now, our friendly nation, Japan, in addition to expelling the aggressive forces of Britain and America, has also returned the concession, showing its deep respect for our country's independence and autonomy. Your leadership and struggle are particularly admired. We will certainly strive from now on, work together, and complete our mission. We respectfully submit this telegram, hoping for your consideration. Shanghai Press Association and Shanghai Magazine Association, together bow.</p>

As for Li Xiuying and Feng Quansheng, they have given up the appeal, otherwise they will be subject to joint punishment.</p>
<h3>Head of Household Should Report False Population Registration by Attached Households</h3>
<p>In order to prevent accidents, the Baojia authorities (保甲當局) of the French Concession have recently notified the heads of households within the concession that they should strictly handle the procedures for applying for and reporting changes in the population within the household, and ordered the heads of households to conduct investigations. Whether the household registration of tenants (attached households) is consistent. If there are false reports by the attached households, the head of household should be responsible for urging them to voluntarily report to the police station. If they do not accept the advice, the head of household should immediately report them to the authorities; otherwise, the head of household will be subject to joint punishment.</p>

<h3>The Fifth Shen Bao Scholarship: Many Students Apply, Current Funds Insufficient, Hope for Continued Donations from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the first day for the distribution of application forms for students of all levels for the fifth Shen Bao Scholarship. Students of all levels braved the light rain and came to collect application forms with the hope of continuing their studies. In total, there were more than 1,000 former students who had received scholarships from this newspaper, and more than 2,000 new students who applied for the first time. This year, the number of students applying for scholarships is expected to exceed 10,000. Judging from the existing funds of this newspaper, it can only help 2,000 people, which is still insufficient. This makes it difficult for the staff of this newspaper to allocate the funds. Therefore, we must once again appeal to people from all walks of life, hoping that they will continue the spirit of the past, cultivate talents, and donate more so that the scholarship work of this newspaper can proceed smoothly and reduce the suffering of poor students who cannot afford to go to school.</p>
<h3>Court Summer Vacation: Change of Office Hours</h3>

<h3>Western Doctor Files Lawsuit, Seeking Recovery of Surgery Fee, Operation Performed Without Defendant's Consent</h3>
<p>Western doctors Czech Korlich and Italian Mi Yeli, through their lawyers, filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court against Zhou Yuzuying (周郁祖英), a 33-year-old local woman residing in Room 15, 2nd Floor, 652 Avenue Joffre (霞飛路), seeking to recover medical expenses of 5,500 yuan. Yesterday, during the hearing, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that the defendant's husband, Zhou Hanliang (周漢良), was hospitalized at Dahua Hospital (大華醫院) in February of this year due to intestinal disease and underwent surgery by the plaintiffs. As a result of the severity of the illness, he died, and the defendant refused to pay the outstanding surgery fee, for which they requested full recovery. The defendant Zhou Yuzuying, represented by Yan Yingwu (嚴英武) and Sun Qimin (孫其敏), argued that the plaintiffs did not determine the condition of the defendant's husband through X-ray diagnosis and performed the operation without authorization, resulting in an accident. Moreover, the defendant's consent was not obtained beforehand, and the two plaintiffs were clearly negligent in their work. They should have filed a criminal lawsuit against the two plaintiffs. Because once reported, an exhumation and autopsy would be necessary, causing unrest to the deceased, the defendant was unwilling to file a lawsuit. As for the surgery fee claimed by the plaintiffs, the defendant did not agree to it and should not be responsible. The court ordered the debate to end and set a date for sentencing.</p>

<h3>Japanese Expeditionary Force Reporting Minister Samon's Inaugural Remarks</h3>
<p>The Reporting Minister of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, Samon (三品), has issued the following inaugural remarks:</p>
<p>I have been appointed to the position of Reporting Minister of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China. As I am a soldier, I hope that everyone will provide guidance and assistance in the future.</p>
<p>From the current stage of the Greater East Asia War, the handling of the mainland problem is not only a major undertaking for China and Japan, but also the largest undertaking in the Greater East Asia region.</p>
<p>The unification and construction of the new China is a major key to completing the Greater East Asia War, and it is also a decisive initiative for the future of the world war. If our Japanese initiative in the war of force and China's great power in the war of politics are integrated with the innovative and historical concepts of the Greater East Asia, I believe that the truly glorious "Orient" will surely appear in the brilliant posture of world history.</p>
<p>The new treaty that has unfolded before our eyes in recent times is the foundation for establishing an eternal and unchanging moral spirit between China and Japan, and I am convinced that this new treaty is an immortal "world charter" that points the new direction for the history of all mankind. I hereby express my full gratitude and look forward to the people of China joining us to usher in that glorious day.</p>

<h3>The Financial Industry Values Production: Implements Low-Interest Loans</h3>
<p>Since the National Government announced the implementation of the wartime economic policy program, the internal organizational structure of the National Commercial Control Association (全國商業統制總會), the joint association committees of various industries, and the control mechanisms of trade associations have been largely completely adjusted and are ready to begin the autonomous control work of commerce immediately. It is understood that in addition to focusing on the control system of collection, distribution, transportation, and sales, the association also emphasizes how to increase production. Currently, various financial institutions in this city, under the guidance of the Central Reserve Bank of China, are striving to invest in agricultural loans. The interest rate issue for production funds allows production enterprises to fully develop. It is heard that recently, the interest rate for wheat loans released by the Central Reserve Bank to the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications is 7%, while the interest rate released by the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications is 8%. In addition, the Bank of Communications' agricultural loans, which belong to the agricultural development banks under a certain percentage, and for individuals developing agriculture, are generally around 1.2%, which is much lower than the market interest rate. It is expected that there will be significant gains in agricultural production in the future.</p>
<h3>National Economic Council Decides to Establish Economic Research Institute, Setting Up Five Working Groups</h3>
<p>The proposal to strengthen national savings and establish an economic research institute, passed by the Second Plenary Session of the National Economic Council (全國經濟委員會), is a comprehensive economic survey work. At the juncture of implementing the wartime economic policy program, it is particularly important work. Therefore, the National Economic Council is actively preparing to carry out the organization, which can be realized in the shortest possible time. It is understood that the main task of the institute is to lead public and private economic survey research institutions, scholars, and experts to conduct surveys and research on the national economic situation according to certain guidelines. The organizational system, under the director and deputy director, in addition to a deliberation committee and a secretary-general, is divided into five groups: finance group, transportation group, agriculture and mining group, industry and commerce group, and food group, to manage all survey and research work. It is also said that it can entrust groups or individuals to investigate.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Economy After the Return of the Concession: Mr. Inagaki's Talk</h3>
<p>Inagaki Noboru (稻垣登), Director of the Materials Control Department of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, recently gave a speech on the topic of "The Return of the Concession and the Future of the Shanghai Economy." The main points are as follows: 1. Since the return of the Public Concession, the government's economic policies can be implemented more smoothly, and at the same time, China's wartime economic system can be quickly strengthened and promoted. 2. In the past, the legal power of the Public Works Department was very weak, so the guiding policies of the Chinese and Japanese authorities had the regret of scratching an itch from outside the boot. After the return of the Concession, this regret can be completely eliminated. 3. From other aspects, the abnormal prosperity of the Concession has gradually subsided. The so-called war profiteering color has disappeared, but it is a big mistake to say that this is a phenomenon of the decline of the concession economy. It is actually an inevitable phenomenon of transition to sound prosperity. After the return of the Concession, the previous semi-free economy will be reformed. In fact, today is the best time for reform, which is expected of the decision-makers and the awakening of economic people. 4. The relationship between the Commercial Control Association (商統會) and the municipal government is very close, so if it does not receive the protection and assistance of the municipal government, the policies of the Commercial Control Association (商統會) cannot achieve full results. The matter is obvious. 5. The return of the Concession has no adverse effects on the people. Measures such as the food problem, price control problem, and the distribution of people's livelihood materials can be thoroughly promoted, so it can be said that it will improve even more. 6. In short, if there are politicians with the correct understanding of the above ideas and economic people who actively devote themselves to public welfare, working together in harmony, Shanghai can be built brightly.</p>
<h3>Rice and Grain Cooperative Starts Work Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry Holds 11th Regular General Meeting of Councilors, President Aoki Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>The Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Shanghai held its 11th Regular General Meeting of Councilors on the 30th at the Japanese Club. First, President Aoki delivered a speech, followed by the commencement of business discussions. The Secretariat then reported on the outline of business operations for the previous year and the summary of the financial accounts. The original plan for the disposal of the previous year's surplus was also approved. The content of President Aoki's speech is recorded below:</p>
<p>Looking back on the past year, not only were Sino-Japanese relations what they were, but China itself, or the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, experienced a year of so-called repeated turmoil and many changes. Regarding Sino-Japanese economic relations, the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry on November 1st last year and the major shift in Japan's diplomacy towards China on January 9th this year, and the subsequent establishment of a new economic policy towards China, are worthy of significant mention. The establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry aimed to unify the multi-headed nature of imperial institutions in China and to realize the centralization of policy implementation. Needless to say, it also hoped to resolve obstacles in Sino-Japanese relations, especially in the economic sphere, to establish the natural relationship between China and Japan, and it was a precursor to the major shift in Japan's diplomacy towards China on January 9th this year. This is a historically significant fact. The comprehensive adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations began on January 9th this year with the major shift in Japan's diplomacy towards China, marking the first step towards realization. In the economic sphere, the new economic policy, centered on the National Commercial Control Association and the soon-to-be-realized China Trade Federation, is being concretely promoted. According to Prime Minister Tojo's speech at the 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Diet on the 15th of this month, the Japanese government plans to take further steps to fundamentally revise the Sino-Japanese Treaty. This, along with the upcoming return of the Shanghai International Settlement, serves as clear evidence of the imminent leap forward in Sino-Japanese relations. All of these developments were unimaginable a year ago. Such heroic and grand policies have a profound impact on politics, economy, diplomacy, culture, and China policy, as well as direct and indirect effects on Japanese residents in China. As we are all well aware, we in the business community are determined not to make sacrifices in establishing a new Sino-Japanese relationship and will actively complete national policies. It must be particularly emphasized that the shift in Japan's diplomatic and economic policies towards China, which has been gradually unfolding since January this year, does not mean that Japan is retreating from China. Its purpose is to establish a permanent system of coexistence and co-prosperity between China and Japan, not an economic retreat from China. The goal of Japan's transformation of its economic policy towards China is to revitalize China's economy and establish a new Chinese economic system to realize common ideals. To understand the current economic situation in China and the true future state of the Chinese economy, two key elements are necessary: First, it must be clearly recognized that China's economy, with the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War as a turning point, has shifted in qualitative terms from a trading China to a producing China, and at the same time, it has had to shift from dependence on the economies of Europe and America to the East Asian Co-prosperity Economic Sphere. Second, China, which has long been called a quasi-colony of Europe and America, has been deeply dependent on Europe and America economically, but now this has been completely severed. Therefore, its own industrial revolution, and the changes that promote industrial revolution, are the only paths. This inevitability should also be clearly recognized. Unless the concept of industrial revolution is followed, China's economic self-sufficiency and the modernization of the Chinese national economy cannot be achieved. Therefore, Japan's various economic policies towards China and in China after the diplomatic transformation are carefully planned to fit this grand goal, and at the same time, they must be promoted in accordance with this direction. If we briefly describe the direction of the new economic policy, at least the following points are noteworthy: First, first establish the common goal of building the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. Second, leap from the confrontational and antagonistic character that has been extremely prone to disputes to the path of collaboration and cooperation. Third, thoroughly recognize that the revival of China's economy is the basis for Sino-Japanese co-prosperity, especially the active cooperation of the Shanghai financial community, the nerve center of the Chinese economy. This is an indispensable requirement. Fourth, the transformation of the new economic policy, which is sufficient to meet the above requirements, is possible not only from the moral and political aspects, but also from the economic aspect. China and Japan have reached a consensus. This principle is not purely theoretical. The organization and practice of the National Commercial Control Association, the concrete expression of the new economic policy towards China, have already been put into practice. This is a common requirement in all economic fields such as finance, industry, commerce, trade, and agriculture, and at the same time, it is a requirement for political and diplomatic aspects. In a sense, it also includes military requirements. This is an important principle that cannot be ignored when implementing economic policies towards China. When revitalizing the new Chinese economy, the above principles and the industrial revolutionary nature of the Chinese economy must be clearly recognized. This is the greatest basic requirement for revitalizing the Chinese economy. Shanghai is the central nerve of the Chinese economy. If Shanghai's economy cannot be revived, then the revival of the Chinese economy is hopeless. Therefore, building Shanghai's economy can be called revitalizing the entire Chinese economy, and it is no exaggeration. Recently, this Chamber of Commerce and Industry established the Economic Shanghai Construction Committee. Relying on the cooperation of everyone and authorities from all walks of life, we are actively examining it. This committee, together with the Sino-Japanese Problem Committee and the Japanese Business Countermeasures Committee, is working as a trinity to build the Shanghai economy. The reason for this is because the national construction of the Shanghai economy is so important. Shifting our gaze beyond China, the internal and external situations are extremely significant. In Japan alone, we are continuing to fight bloody battles to establish an invincible and undefeated posture. The actual situation is fully expressed by various decisive economic policies, the 81st Decisive Battle Diet held in the spring, and the currently convened 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Diet. Japan's decisive economic policy is concentrated on the five major industries of iron, coal, light metals, ships, and aircraft, laying a solid foundation. As everyone knows, this strong Japanese decisive economic system is increasingly entering the iron wall of preparation due to the "Enterprise Consolidation Funding Measures Law" passed by the 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Diet. According to Minister of Commerce and Industry Kishi's explanation in the Diet, the enterprise consolidation stipulated in the law is different in nature from the enterprise consolidation taken in the past due to insufficient materials. This time's enterprise consolidation is actually "enterprise consolidation implemented due to increased production capacity." Therefore, this consolidation is not like the previous consolidation, which only focused on the reorganization and integration of light industry. It extends to the required parts of all fields of industry. Each required industry will be classified according to its nature into startup, maintenance, transfer, suspension, and abandonment in order to achieve the following purposes and complete sufficient preparation: (1) Transfer of equipment, (2) Distribution of labor to important industries, (3) Recovery of scrap iron. This is an unavoidable requirement to strike down England and America. At this time, an important event for us in the Shanghai financial community is that this kind of enterprise adjustment in Japan also has a major relationship with the Chinese economy. According to Minister of Commerce and Industry Kishi's explanation in the Diet: "China is currently focusing on the restoration and replenishment of cotton mills in China. In addition, the second and third transfers of retained equipment are also being actively promoted." That is, the transfer of light industry to China is currently being actively planned. Under the Sino-Japanese comprehensive plan, a new era of building a new Chinese economy has finally arrived. We in the Shanghai financial community deeply feel that our mission and responsibility are becoming increasingly important. Japan's decisive battle economy is now moving towards an invincible system. Furthermore, under the comprehensive economic cooperation between China and Japan, the progress of Shanghai's economic construction can be expected. Under great power, relying on the wise strategy and bravery of the imperial army soldiers, and the firm unity of 100 million citizens, Japan is increasingly establishing an invincible and undefeated solid陣. We, the people, can only express our gratitude. At the same time, we express our heartfelt gratitude to the heroic spirits who died for the country and the soldiers of the imperial army, and vow to take the hearts of the soldiers on the front line as our own, and to work even harder to promote Sino-Japanese cooperation in order to complete the important task of the current situation.</p>

<h3>The Popular Literature We Need</h3>
<p>— Dongfang</p>
<p>Our country's literature has moved from difficult and obscure classical Chinese to easy-to-understand vernacular Chinese, which has spread literature to all classes. Originally, it was inevitable that popular literature would have a large number of readers, because most readers are middle and lower classes with relatively low knowledge. Writing in a profound and obscure way can only be studied and savored by a few people, while easy-to-understand writing is what the masses welcome.</p>
<p>How can we define easy-to-understand? To determine this standard, we must first see what is being written, and we cannot decide in general terms. For example, if it is a literary work, then we must use "literature" to set the standard for easy understanding. Literary creation is entirely a concrete and vivid description of images. Here, we must abandon those unclear fantasies, abandon those distorted morbid psychologies, and not use profound and abstract terms. We must be realistic and directly and clearly express reality. In literary creation, being able to do this can generally achieve the goals of "easy to understand" and popularization.</p>
<p>Theoretical articles are more difficult. Here, the application of various difficult academic terms and new terms cannot be avoided. Moreover, the purpose of theoretical articles is to instill some theories in readers, some universal laws that run through the roots of individual events, and correct concepts and correct terms are needed. Therefore, it is impossible to avoid using various difficult academic and new terms.</p>
<p>There may be authors who deliberately use new terms to show off novelty, but this is not very common. Most people still seem unable to fully utilize them, resulting in the terms becoming rigid and difficult to understand. To write a theoretical article in a popular and simple way does not mean abandoning the application of all terms. We should strive to utilize terms, which is the correct path. Because the purpose of popularization is not only to make the public understand, but also to instill in the public some richer knowledge and scientific literacy, and to improve the level of the public. Therefore, the popular literature we need: in terms of creation, we must boldly and clearly write about reality, avoid unnecessary fantasies and descriptions, and avoid the application of abstract terms; and when writing theoretical articles, we must utilize terms, use simple explanations, and make them vivid and easy to understand.</p>
<h3>Grasp the Present</h3>
<p>— Jieying</p>
<p>In this current period, everyone feels that the present life is too difficult. So many people recall the past. Everything in the past is very beautiful and very sweet in their minds; at the same time, many people are dreaming about the future, dreaming that the future will bring them happiness.</p>
<p>However, "the past cannot be chased, and the future cannot be relied upon." What is the use of recalling and dreaming? Everything in the past has become the past, and the past will never return to the present. And where is the future? And what is the basis for believing that the future will definitely bring happiness?</p>
<p>The future is embodied in the present, the present moment. Seconds gradually become the past, and the seconds of the future are gradually coming to the present. The past is over, dead; and what about the future? The future is alive, but it is also empty. Only this present is real, is true. If we want to be happy, if we want to be happy, memories and dreams cannot provide us with anything. Only the present. Only by working hard in the present can we create happiness.</p>
<h3>Thinking and Doing</h3>
<p>— Wentian</p>
<p>There must be a close connection between "thinking" and "doing". They cannot be separated too far. Just "thinking" without "doing" is close to "dreaming"; just "doing" without "thinking" will lead to "recklessness". "Dreaming" and "recklessness" cannot achieve any cause.</p>
<p>The "brain" must be clear and the "hands" must be diligent and conscientious, each fulfilling their duties and cooperating harmoniously. Any difficult problem can be broken through and success can be achieved.</p>
<p>If one acts and behaves with the public interest as a prerequisite and one's own conscience as a guide, one will not do evil, reverse black and white, and be spurned by others.</p>
<p>Do not despise others, and do not take others too seriously. Do not boast about oneself, and do not underestimate oneself.</p>
<p>Put success or failure aside, stand tall, have nothing to be ashamed of, be courageous and not hesitate, then there is nothing that cannot be done in the world.</p>
<h3>Review of "Song of Rejuvenation"</h3>
<p>— Luguang</p>
<p>It is a great honor to see the performance of "Song of Rejuvenation." In the barren art world, this is a good harvest. From "Song of Rejuvenation," we can clearly know that Chinese films have a bright future, because the old ones are old and useless, but the new ones? Truly, "the younger generation is to be feared."</p>
<p>"Song of Rejuvenation" tells the story of an artist's experience in the theater movement from beginning to end. It has reality, so under the extremely strong human touch, every scene deeply touches the hearts of the audience. The second half, starting from Liu Qiong's drunken foot-dragging, shows even more clearly the plight of the pitiful artist. Unfortunate!</p>
<p>There are plays within the play, with "Camellia," "Romeo and Juliet," and "Song of Rejuvenation" performed on the stage of a drama. Because the actors have experience in stage plays, the excellence of the performance is the most exciting part of the whole film. At the same time, the editing is concise, with no dragging.</p>
<p>If we were to find shortcomings, then the ending needs to be discussed. Because the film is ultimately a work of art, it cannot excessively cater to "business." Happy endings and other things have disappeared in the progress of the times.</p>
<p>Liu Jian's acting skills are impeccable. Hu Feng has also broken previous records. Tian Jun hopes he will work harder! The scenery and lighting can all be rated highly.</p>
<h3>Random Notes from the Film City</h3>
<p>"Love Threads in a Singing Gown" went to Hangzhou last month on the 27th to shoot outdoor scenes. Mei Xi, Tong Zhiling, and others made a large and imposing group, adding a lot of color to West Lake. After the start of filming for "New Life," the work is extremely tense. Director Gao Lihong works day and night, and assistant director Yuan Lei became ill due to being too busy.</p>
<p>Yue Feng's new work, "Life and Death Robbery," has already passed the script and began to build sets in the First Studio on the 25th. Filming officially began on the 28th. The male and female leads were originally planned to be Gao Zhanfei and Yuan Meiyun, but now that Gao Yuan has another new work, it has been changed to a collaboration between Shu Shi and Hu Feng.</p>
<p>Zhu Shilin's work after "Good Night, Flowers and Moonlight" is "Second Generation". The male and female leads have been decided as Liu Qiong, Lv Yukun, Yan Jun, etc. Recently, Zhu Shilin is rushing to write the script and will start filming in the Fourth Studio after "New Life."</p>
<p>He Zhaozhang's new work, "Peach Blossom Pool Water," has already started filming in the Second Studio. The main actors are Zhou Manhua, Yan Hua, and Xu Li.</p>
<h3>Chicken</h3>
<p>— Shen Shen</p>
<p>"I definitely won't! I've worked so hard to raise it until today, and it's just starting to lay eggs. I won't!" Xiu Bao shouted resolutely.</p>
<p>"Damn it! No way! Our commander wants to eat chicken, how can we disobey! Don't even mention eating your chicken, we can take your lives, and you can't disobey! Hurry! Hurry! Don't delay my official business!" This little fellow in gray cloth said bluntly that he had to have it.</p>
<p>"Please take care of us, sir! It's our laying hen. We really rely on it to make a living. I'm willing to give you some of the eggs from our house. Please take care of us, sir!" Ah Kun begged in a pitiful tone. He was determined not to let them take away the chicken that they relied on for a living, insisting and blocking them.</p>
<p>"Okay! If you won't give it, you won't give it! Just wait and see!" The little fellow in gray cloth expressed his displeasure and left.</p>
<p>"Dad! My laying hen. How can we let them eat it for nothing? Tomorrow we'll have four more eggs. I want to save one egg every day. When it stops laying eggs (when the chicken stops laying eggs), I can exchange it for a floral cotton jacket material. I'll have it made and wear it for the New Year, Dad! You'll let me, won't you!" Xiu Bao was relieved and happily chattering to Ah Kun.</p>
<p>"Oh! Okay!" Ah Kun was over fifty years old after all, and he knew a little about the ways of the world. He thought that even though it was said to be peaceful now, "just wait and see" always meant trouble later on. He felt a little uneasy in his heart.</p>
<p>After dinner, Xiu Bao went to bed first. Under the dim light of a lamp, Ah Kun sat at the table and said to his wife, "There are so many ×× teams these days, going back and forth. This time it's Zhang's unit, that time it's Wang's unit. Donations for bedding, donations for shoes and socks, donations for cigarettes, donations for liquor. We country people are exhausted. If they can't eat our chicken today, they'll probably come again tomorrow. What can we say!" Ah Kun's wife listened and didn't understand much, remaining silent and sighing along with him.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Suddenly, there was urgent knocking on the front door of Ah Kun's house, followed by shouts outside the door: "Open the door! Open the door! Hurry!" Ah Kun was very frightened and trembling as he went to open the door. Six or seven people in gray cloth rushed in. The first one was the little fellow who had come to catch the chicken earlier.</p>
<p>"Speak up! Hand it over quickly! You have a gun in your house! A gun! You're no good! You're in league with the communists!" The people who came shouted all at once, chattering noisily. One grabbed Ah Kun's clothes, and then slaps and fists rained down on Ah Kun like raindrops.</p>
<p>"No...no...no gun...I'm a farmer, I wouldn't be in league with the communists!" Ah Kun said tremblingly.</p>
<p>"Take him to the headquarters for questioning. We'll give him a heavy punishment. He's trying to deceive us! Go! Go! Go!" One of the people in gray cloth said this, pointing to the one who was pulling Ah Kun's collar tightly.</p>
<p>"Search the house first! Maybe he hid the gun!" Another said, so two or three of them rushed into Ah Kun's bedroom. But Ah Kun's house was originally bare and empty. There were no clothes or old clothes worth their attention. There was only a silver chain and a silver lock, which Xiu Bao's in-laws had given when they were engaged. They finally appreciated it and took it away.</p>
<p>"Go! Go! Go! Take him to the headquarters for questioning!" So they pulled Ah Kun by his collar and went off in a hubbub. (2)</p>
