<p>社評</p>
<h3>目前教育上幾個實際問題</h3>
<p>現代國家，對於中小學敎育，非常注意其基礎的確立與合理的發展。中小學敎育，原是國家敎育的基礎，欲謀立國於世，自應特別重視，我國對於中小學敎育，近年經政府敎育當局與民間敎育界人士之努力經營，漸由萌芽時期進至展開時期。從整個觀察，全國學齡兒童中就學者與失學者間的比例，雖然可以驚人，全國地域面積與學校數量的比例，雖然令人寒慄，可是，在短時期中，國人對於中小學敎育基礎的建立，中小學敎育事粱的推動，其功亦不可沒。當然，我們更需要不斷的努力，普及中小學敎育，給予全國學齡兒童都有受敎育的機會。</p>
<p>上面說的，是關於中小學敎育量的方面，應該普及。然而，同樣重要的質的方面，也應該注意，尤其在目前尙未普及時期，確立素質優良的基礎，將來漸漸擴展，保持質與量同時並進。所以，今天我們對於中小學敎育的素質，應常特別注意其實際上的問題。</p>
<p>我們在討論實際問題之先，爲强調這問題需要注意的迫切，作一廣泛的觀察。今天我們國家的病，在於貧乏；人民的病，在於缺乏現代知識，缺乏生產學識與生產技能的知識。國家貧乏與人民缺乏現代知識的現象，呈現於社會表面者，乃爲混亂騷擾，因此，今日敎育之素質，尤其中小學敎育之素質，不在於徒搬東西洋不合我國國情的敎育原理，主義與學制，而在於授予學生以實際適合需要的知識。使個人能恃以爲生，國家與社會能賴以進入建設與進化之途。然而，今日敎育之所表現者，一部分大學校徒爲富裕子弟的消閑塲所，徒爲富裕子弟獵取功名利祿的階梯。惟其日的在於消閑，因此敎者不免放任，學者習於荒嬉，侈談交際，高論戀愛，優遊歌舞，竟成風氣。惟其目的在於獵取功名利祿，因此學校成爲爭取功名的實習地。國家地位如何，時局形勢如何，漠然無知，學業成續，更置腦後。至於大多數中學校，則絕無獨立性，似專爲升入大學的準備，所學與實際生活隔離，純爲書本上的裝飾知識。惟其無獨立性，因此，除少數富裕子弟能得升入大學，以完成其裝飾門面與獵取功名美夢外，多數無力升學者，很易流爲一無所長一無所用的遊民。會有人批評，近數十年的敎育，由「土八股一改爲「洋八股」，由一「土科舉」改爲「洋科舉」，旣與實際社會不發生關係，即與受敎育者本身生活，亦毫無關係。我們試切實檢討今日敎育界的一般情形，如不强自掩飾，殆將慚愧無以自答。質言之，今日的敎育，是拉靑年出社會，與實際生活分離，而非引靑年入社會，以解決其本身及社會一切問題。爲提高靑年生活之慾望，走入奢靡無用無能之絕境，而非導靑年走入生產與建設的坦途。所以，愈敎而國愈貧，人民乃愈痛苦。</p>
<p>上海是全國敎育最發達的地方，也是足以影響全國各地敎育趨向的地方。過去久受英美色彩的渲染，敎育方法與目標，與我國國情未能適合。現在英美勢力剷除，在敎育上的英美色彩也應剷除，以適合我國國情與社會需要爲確立敎育方針的唯一前提。我們根據這一前提，提出若干目前教育上實際問題，以供大家討論：　　　初中興小學學生，年齡大概都在五歲以下，尤其小學學生有不及十歲的，功課種類旣繁瑣，學習鐘點又多，同時，還須象日文與英文，在本國文之外，須讀兩種外國文，此在發育未全，腦力未充的兒童極不適宜。據我們的經念，稚年讀英文，絕不易消化，徒然　兒童腦力，影響學習別種功課。因此，我們主張小學絕對不讀外國文，中學以後開始酌讀必安的外國文。而目前中學的英文課程應予減少。</p>
<p>初中與小學學生，向在稚年，體力未充，功課繁重，必須顧到具是否堪以負重，爲學齡兒重的體力健康着想，我們主張減少科目種類的繁瑣，而着重於敎習的透澈，與其多而濫，不能消化，不如少而精，充分領悟。</p>
<p>體育之重嬰，原與德智二育並無二致，有充實的知識，必須有堅强的體魄，才可以使用不絕。弱不禁風的體質，縱有豐富知識，亦難期其經久。目前上海大多數學校面於　境地位，對於體育根本廢止，學生體魄鍛練，確是敵重問題，無論如何，學校當局應爲補救之法。</p>
<p>自然科學方面的實習試騐設備，因陋就簡，甚且根本未有，書本知識得不到騐證，對於將來應用上的困難隔膜，不難想見。應由政府機關籌措經費，充實設備，借給各學校使用，原則上因設備不充分而減少實習時間，已很勉强，何况根本無實習呢？</p>
<p>大學學生在年齡體力思想上，都已至可以接受嚴格訓練的階段，目前的大學敎育，應施以戰時特別訓練，與戰時知識技能，尤須絕對嚴肅生活管理。我們前於六月八日會主張男學生應剃光頭，不穿西裝，不街華服，不屢皮鞋。女學生應不燙髮，不數粉。我們幷非矯枉過正，故作高關，實在覺得關整敎育方法，非先從嚴肅生活入手不為功。</p>

<h3>東綫況濘期將　蘇攻勢加緊　包圍德軍計劃失敗</h3>
<p>柏林一日中央社電據海通社訊，德軍負責人士昨夜宣稱：蘇軍之續在亞索夫海迤北庫彭橋頭堡·聶伯橋頭堡等地增援，其原因顯係深恐泥濘時期之來臨，欲在目前得一決定之進展。但其猛攻突破及包園穗軍之計劃迄未獲逞，均遭德軍擊退。</p>
<p>聶伯河岸戰事激烈</p>
<p>柏林一日中央社電　海通社訊：蘇軍在東綫攻勢之重心·現仍在索薩河與上聶伯河之問，德軍仍在轉移新陣地，機續予以抵抗。敵方一再以堅强之坦克車與步兵企圖突破軍之則翼，卒　德軍之彈性防禦戰略，敵軍始終未能獲逞。聶伯灣與亞索夫海間之南翼，現由孟斯坦將軍指揮作戰，得生力軍之增援後，巳抱絕大決心迎擊敵軍之進攻，戰事雖激烈，但巳成膠着狀態。敵軍現在續調精銳，企圖在克里米亞與下聶伯河之間，作鉗形之推進。前日蘇軍進襲柴普魯塞伊並未獲逞，昨晨敵向梅里托波爾展開進攻，現仍在苦戰中　蘇軍在聶伯河前綫再調增援企圖渡河，但亦無顯著之成功。就東錢一般戰局而論，穗軍沉着應戰利用靈活之戰略，今已加强抵抗實力。</p>
<h3>郭培爾重申　爭取勝利决心　公理武力終將顯其效能</h3>
<p>柏林一日中央社電　德國宣傳部長郭培爾在本星期之「國家雜誌」中發表一論文，題為「當時機到臨時」，內稱「我人並不懼怕敵人，我人不僅具有公理，而且具有武力。當特機到臨時，公理與武力均將顯示其效能」。部長指出「在目下遍地烽火之爭鬭中，無一交戰國能避免至少一次致命危機之經騐，如英國於鄧扣克一役之後，蘇聯在德軍勢將包圍莫斯科之時，美國於珍珠港一役及喪失菲島之後，莫不如此」。</p>
<p>忍受挫折決不屈服</p>
<p>郭氏解釋「我德人在此次戰爭中　遇類似之磨練，原無足異，但就一般而言，我人在物質上克服此種磨難，較敵方更爲容易，蓋一因我人擁有富足之儲備，一可供源源取用也」，但郭氏警告在挫折與損失下之忍耐·需要一種訓練，而德人對於此種訓練尙付闕如。郭培爾稱，「敵人常然欲思說服德人，謂德人並無戰勝之希望，並議笑德人樂觀之期望，以爲如此可使德人屈服，否則任何武力之壓迫，不能使穗人屈服」。</p>
<p>孰為戒首母庸曉辯</p>
<p>論文中又述及敵人所稱此次戰爭非由彼開　，市企圖完全諉過於德人一節。郭氏追述戰前龍罩於歐洲之嚴重危機，此種危機之微象，爲大戰之起因，並提醒謂者，敵人如何忍耐等候共時機，以及如何熱切準備若狂。郭氏宣稱「我人所以賺得敵人之忿怒與仇視者、乃因我人巳覽察此種危險而採取適常之步驟以對付之。敵人指責找人爲戰爭之戎首，僅因我人對敵人勒斃我人之企圖」加以抵抗而已，凡此一切皆甚明顯·且己由敵人自己所宣佈之戰爭目標加以證實，今日此等戰爭目標全屬空言，我人若不武裝自已，則此等戰爭目標早已實現多時矣一。</p>
<p>生存權利全力以爭</p>
<p>欲使此次戰事結東·而重返眞正之和平，惟有一途·即德國之勝利是」郭氏斷言　歷史上若果有一國人民決心以勝利終止其被迫而作之戰爭者·常推今日德國之人民」。郭氏續稱，一敵人愈以恐怖手段劫尊我人之人生必需品與享受　則我人之生活標準將愈形簡樸，而愈加無條件堅持我人之要求「郭氏鄭重聲稱，「世界無一種勢力，能强迫我人放棄我人自由生命獨立與發展可能之基本權利」。郭氏復論及德國人民在此次戰爭中所受之磨鍊與犧牲，及決心與增强之實力稱，「敵人若以爲德人巳厭戰，或巳因戰爭而疲憊，實爲錯誤。無論如何德人顯示此種現象，較其敵人爲少」。</p>
<p>西歐園牆敵人墓地</p>
<p>郭氏警告稱·「倫敦一班新聞記者，若侈言向柏林列隊進行之荒謬故事，則我人僅欲指出，在大西洋園牆之三和士龐大石塊間，尙有充份之餘地，足爲英兵之大塚地。英美對德平民之恐怖空龔，顯然係出於英國政治家之主意，但我人願指出任何對我人所發之打擊，決無來而不往之理。我人之報復有時固甚遲緩，但終必實施之，往往在敵人巳將此事置諸腦後之時，我人始實行報復，我人覺得此種態度與見解，並無不合，蓋我人自知軍事實力充足，遲早固不成問題也。此次大戰與第一次世界大戰不同，非謊言欺騙所能洪。敵人已對我人動武，但我人兵不　之一。</p>

<h3>廣田發表　世界戰局談話</h3>
<p>在滬陸海外之常局聯合報道常會昨循例舉行，日本大使館上海事務所計到廣田情報課長福問副領事等，即席由廣田課長就現今世界戰局進行觀察，發表談話如次：</p>
<p>亞歐戰局</p>
<p>廣田首謂「目前世界戰局現　段中，在亞歐兩局而反軸心有反攻作戰之發現，斯項事實，在此世界戰况階段中當爲應右之事『然我人所特別注意者，即此次反軸心之反攻，並非認爲總攻之事實，是以反軸心所宣布之戰局情况，爲重大之錯誤，更且日漸顯著，以戰局全體上觀，軸心之採取全動立塲，尤爲明顯·故目今反軸心之宣布反攻實際上所得完全粗反，以東度西南太平洋上作戰情形如新幾內亞所羅門羣島之作戰，反軸心方面認爲異常得意，其實毫無所得，再如北部阿留愼羣島之情况，以阿茲島所駐日軍部而歡巳完成神聖任務·建立不可泯滅不朽之偉大勛續，詎在反軸心方而，竟又誇大其訶·我人試按地圖來看，則一年來反軸心進攻情形、及日本卞而自大結亞戰爭爆發以來所獲得之滬大戰　與之相比·其距離而　，反軸心則得數十倍之一。</p>
<p>最後勝利</p>
<p>繼就歐洲情形加以說明，謂德團向法國開戰之初，德國即直衝法馬奇諾防綫，其時反軸心方面即觀察穗軍將爲所阻，不能攻入，但於事實上，德軍勢如破竹，從容擊破馬奇諾防綫，嗣再下無聊觀察，謂反軸心朱至一九四三年前，可使德國崩潰，再於一九四年至一九四五年兩年內使日本就範，此項宣傳，反證今德國非但無崩潰之象微，且作戰力量更日臻堅强，但日德軸心之觀察反軸心鳴運，從未有誤，而措置準確，把握勝利無疑。</p>
<p>散放流言</p>
<p>廣田氏未就現今作戰大局進行加以說明、謂軸心巳站在全動地位，此乃明顯之事實，而反軸心之誇大宣傳，更難令人置信，反軸心最近竟又散佈謠言，播放和平空氣容以緩和軸心，此舉更令人唾素。且反軸心爲求打開內部紛歧局而，曾召開會議，建議以抹煞權益辦法之方式，以謀永久努力支持長期作戰之準備，查此項事實，早爲我軸心所準備就緒，猛烈作戰，堅定吾軸必最後勝利，再現今戰局來親，軸必確立主動地位，同時本人希望諸君特別注意者，即最近日致府發表設立軍需省，其進行益使日本國內戰事體制更為加强。在另一方面言，大束亞各國關係合作，更日益堅固，我人之長期作戰體制已完成就緒，至歐洲德國工業發達，實堪驚人，今已改造新形潛水艇及新型飛機並預備大量生產此種新型武器，今後對反軸心作戰更發揮龐大力量·我人當期待德新武器早日出現云。</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>全國商聯會</h3>
<p>我們以前稅過，一切更進步的社會經濟狀態，實有賴於經濟界領袖的努力推進，因爲經濟界領袖·非特爲經濟事業的領袖，抑且爲經濟思想的領袖·所以，對於人民生活，必須有澈底的認識，對於人民意旨，必須有澈底的瞭解，凡是時代與環境所要求的，袛要是於政府無損·於人民有益，應儘量多多建議，多多貢獻，毋慮人民不會擁體，政府不會接納。</p>
<p>本市商界有力人士·鑒於政府經濟政策之施行、有賴於團結一致之各地商業團體爲之後盾，故擬發起籌組全國商會聯合會，其辦法爲由上海·蘇州·杭州·蚌埠。南京五地之商會爲發起人，依法呈准政府設立之。戰前本有全國商會聯合會之組織，其宗旨即爲上以傳達政府意志，下以溝通商民情况；戰後因種種開係此項機構，不復存在，賴以溝通官商意見之惟一機構·惟有市商會而巳。</p>
<p>在全國商業統制總會成立之初，一般人似不甚明瞭商統會與市商會之職權關係·旋經有力方面解釋，　知商統會為華物資收買興配給之最高統制機關·遵照政府指示，實施統制事宜，而市商會則為上海商界之代表，對當局盡建議與輔助之責任，同時亦可作爲官民間之疏通意見的機關。所以，最近市商會所採取的幾個議決案，可以說是代表它的本位工作。市商會的任務如此，全國商聯會的任務，也是如此，祗是後者所代表的範圍，更爲擴大，而其意見的表示，亦更爲集中與張化。</p>
<p>我們竭誠希望全國商聯會之早日實現，庶幾全國經濟領袖，常能會萃一堂，運用其合理化的思想，以謀政府與人民意見之全盤配合，社會與經濟問題之基層解決。</p>

<h3>糧食問題意見　—特轉之二—</h3>
<p>古　有云：「民以食為天·」可見糧食之成問題，古時已然，不自今始。不過常此動亂時代，更形嚴重與尖銳化而已。茲筆者願秉至誠的心，和紳潔的意·指出若千現政府對於糧政施行上的不當和弊竇，及其需要加以改進之點，撮述於后；期望當軸容能參酌採納一二焉，初無故施攻訐之心存乎其間也。</p>
<p>弊害要點之　：</p>
<p>糧政機　對於責任之推諉。</p>
<p>原有配給量，市民本巳感不敷過巨，盼望當局增配改善，有甚於大旱之望雲霓；豈知自最近兩個中月以來，配給量相反地的更减少一倍甚或一倍以上。（在七月一日至九月十五日的七十五天之中，一八兩區僅配給七次，共釘雜米七升半。舊市區更少於此數。）根據滬市聯營社及糧管局主持者的歷次談話及聲明，不外：缺款，缺乏運輸器具，和糧食部撥米未發，以致未能如期按量配發。可是誰負籌款的責任？誰是負責辦埋運輸者？而指撥民米的又是誰？道種種自有專責的人員分負其責，一官一吏之失職，其影響及於全市數百萬的生靈，政府豈容忽視和姑息，任令負責者對於責任之推諉而置之不究？</p>
<p>其改進點之　：</p>
<p>健全機　，　淸責任，和嚴定賞罰。　　筆者認爲糧政機構組織的健全，固屬首要，然劃淸責任，以專事權；嚴定賞罰，以憑獎懲，亦爲絕對必要者。例如：糧食部旣爲全面之總機構，則對於各縣市所請協撥之米糧·自須以絕大的努力以應付之。而各縣市之配給機構，亦須一秉公正而廉潔的責任心，爲國家爲民衆服務，如有失職，營私，及舞弊等情發生，當軸須以最大之決心，破除情面，嚴加懲儆，亳不瞻徇；其有辦理成績超衆者，應予以特殊光榮之嘉獎，用昭激勸。</p>
<p>弊害要點之　：</p>
<p>不法之敢購。</p>
<p>考現在各鄉收購米糧之辦怯，尙無合法之準則，而收買價格，亦未公佈規定·於是一般收購米糧人員中，難保不有不肖份子，乘機假公　私，如强迫勒派，出價過低·藉詞沒收，及威逼等等不一而一足，於是農民畏之如虎狼，巳收穫者，密藏於窟，夫秤者則因有鑒於此，故盡行改種其他作物，在此情形之下，而欲言增進　產物，實無異於　緣木求魚矣。</p>
<p>其改進點之　：</p>
<p>規定收購準則及價格，並嚴格管理恥　人員。</p>
<p>對於收購米糧之準則及價格，自須由當局嚴密規定，並明令公佈曉示，以免取巧。對於收購人員的人事方面，更非嚴格管理不可，明令凡遇有藉詞壓迫，持强勒購，及不按規定收買價格給償者，被害者得控請就地官憲，加以救濟，以保論農民之正富利益·這樣，政府自易得到大冬數農民的密切的合作之效·　不宣傳勸導增產，而產量且將不增而自增唱此外，並宜就出　量較多或超過若干時之農民·予以免除賦稅之一部或全部，以資　勵，至若以　市收買歸公之棉布，及鄉農切盼之糖　等，按　價照其出賣量之多　而比例搭行配給·亦可收　勵出賣之效也。</p>
<p>弊害要點之　：</p>
<p>當地無　存以備或有之缺乏及延誤。</p>
<p>現時　市並無積榖食之設備，所配給民衆者，均　甫經運到之少數，以是一遇發生問題，即牽動全市民命·而黑市因之猖獗。糧食機構內之不肖份子，且推波　瀾，尅扣私運而售之於黑市，正當配給停止减少，或延期。黑市乃愈暴漲，而此輩不肖份子更以利愈厚而愈多私運，私售，而正當配給更無改善之望矣。如此循環倒轉，形成現在一個極端嚴重的局面，失察失治之咎，政府應亦不容否認者也。</p>
<p>其改進點之　：</p>
<p>積極存糧及取　黑市。</p>
<p>為今之計，宜先儘量購運，以備需要·一面除對欠發之米糧謀逐漸恢復舊有量并補配外，且當逐漸增至常人食量需要點，即每月每口約以配給一斗五升爲準則。此外並宜逐月留儲若干，期於每兩個月內購運之量足敷配給全市三個月之需要，如此，在六個月內，即可預存儲有足敷配給全市三個月之食量，以後即使遇有事故，亦可應付裕如矣。而黑市之取締，如能澈底消滅，則一面旣足使農民僅能以其所有，按照官價，售之於政府外，另一面且可消滅一般不肖人員私遝私售之企圖；唯此舉似宜在先謀「使民足食」之後，始千嚴格取締而消滅之，方可免市民之　動也。</p>
<p>弊害要點之　：</p>
<p>配給有沙質之麵粉及腐霉之來，碍及健康，配給物之等次模棱不明。</p>
<p>歷次配給之食米，大多數米質惡劣，且雜有甚多之砂屑石子，即麵粉亦時有沙屑　雜其中，內中雖不免有原本不潔者，然不肖份子因增重米粉之量而攙雜者，亦難保不有。但是；米尙可費些光陰加以淸除，而麵粉即除吞而不嚼外，復有何辦法丫此其攸關國民健康，豈淺尠哉！且配給時公出告中之語罰，時因橫兩可，而予一般　售米店以變澳等次之機會·例如一本期每口配給白米或糙米半升及碎一米半升」，如此市民所購配給食糧應以不碍健康爲前捷，等次尤須明白規定，以杜取巧·</p>
<p>配給食糧如因米麥不數，可搭配赤豆，　豆，專豆，及菉豆等不碍健康衙生之補助雜糧，一般雜有沙礫泥土以及腐尋不堪供食者，絕對不當配給。蓋人民體質之强弱，即國家之强弱也。當局應以此為念，確保民衆之健康。同時，配給時之公告應明日規定「Ｘ號白米若干及Ｘ號Ｘ米若干」，儘量避用含混及兩可之語詞，如此一般不法之徒自無從再施其—偷天換日—之技倆矣。</p>
<p>弊害要點之　：</p>
<p>食米以升斗計算之不盡準確。</p>
<p>看國富俗量米向以升斗爲計數之標準，每市石一按照規定應以凈重一百五十六市斤爲準，每市升約重市秤一斤又八兩九錢六分。然而各店鑒於民衆之不明其比重而任意尅扣，從求有足重者。雖有若干市民明乎此而向之交涉者，米店夥大率以規定配給本以升斗計爲辭，亦無奈之何，暗中虧少約達十之〇·五之譜也。</p>
<p>其改進點之　：</p>
<p>改升斗爲斤兩計算之。</p>
<p>爲避免此項弊竇計，嗣後配給口量，可廢除升似制而改以斤兩計算，一斗配給麵粉然。因爲市秤係屬通常家家使用者，非若升斗之爲米店所獨備也。</p>
<p>弊害要點之　：</p>
<p>糧政人員的委任失當。</p>
<p>我國政治的不能修明，由於吏治的不良，這是誰都不能否認的事實。事有肥油可撈者，鑽之營之，無所不至。一任發上數十萬或數百萬元的財產，視爲常事，不以爲恥。此種現象，自遜淸以迄民初，自民初以迄於今，還是繼續奉行不迭，常軸的委任官吏，尙脫離不了鄉誼，私交，派別，情面等的關係，根永還沒有採用以「　幹」和「廉潔」作爲銓衡和錄用的標準。糧政自非例外，安得不　！</p>
<p>其改進點之　：</p>
<p>糧政機構以官民同辦，而另設一監察委員會。</p>
<p>糧政機構現已革新改組：另委當地名人聞士相任專職，然聞人名士亦不能必其全屬廉潔。務須默察其往日之操守和品行，始鄭重委之。此外並須另設一監察委員會，以資不時監察。其人選可以各公北社團中之公正人士組之，例如報界，學界，工商界等之公會或工會等等。以執行其超然之監察權，以期盡去一切可能發生的一弊寶，而臻於至善。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>昔先儒孟子曰：「得大下有道：得其民，斯得大下矣。得其民有道；得其心，斯得民矣。得其心有道；所欲與之聚之，所惡勿施爾也。」改善糧政，所以安定民生：安定。生，實今百政之首要，我願今之爲政者盍三復斯言　！</p>
<h3>上海糧食配給機之新調整及其方策（一）</h3>
<p>— 黃垂聖</p>
<p>孫中山先生在建　大綱中說：「建國之首要在民生，故對於全國人民之衣食住行四大需要、政府當與人民協力共謀農業之發展，以足民食，共謀織造之發展，以裕民衣，建築大則劃之各式房屋，以利民居，修治道路運河以利民行。」我國對於糧食問題，上自政府，下至人民，古來均甚重視。詩云：「迺　酒倉，酒裹　糧·爰方啓行。「可見糧食之重要者以「民可百年無貨，不可一朝有飢。」</p>
<p>自戰爭以來，上海外斷內隔，糧食問題突然造成一重大嚴重之因案，其故在於：　糧食不足之現象。　物價絡興農民生活之不平衡，　農業地范圍縮少，　生產量之減少，　運輸興　　之阻斷，　苛捐難稅，　大批　稍，　人口增加，以致近年米商，誠然，商人惟利是團，只知有已，不知有人，其目的為牟利，即以牟利為目的，　　以求，無非在此亂世之間，仍思增利，「登壟斷而左右望」；此：乃婦商得意之時也。上海自去年七月間實施計口授糧之策，配給之制度，仍未寬達於完滿，羄人民生命健康於題外，而造市場米價黑市格之奇高，此乃為計口授糧組織之敗也。試觀「去年江蘇建設應發表　鄉　地一千三百萬畝，稍款生產三千三陳萬石，小　八百佢石米，不下二千二百萬石　　六百萬石。上海市　境若奉　·高定·崇明·　山·南匯·北橋等區，亦當產米有五六百萬石之譜。……再加上海人中五百萬人，約共一千一百五十萬人，以每人平均每年食米二石計，則需米二千三百萬石。以蘇省清鄉區及」上海市轄境之米，供需尙稍袋合。……而糧食問題年九月十日新聞報經濟評論）以上證實，江蘇一省食糧自給問題應無疑問，麵粉，難糧以外，每期附加調整配給，自當竟然無缺乏恐慌之慮。然今日上海全體市民，寬無一不以是糧食為苦，考其原因，可分為下列，并略述今後應有之方案，以有討論。</p>
<p>糧食統制組織之不，健全—糧食統制，為對糧食品之生產，消費及其價格，采用統制政策。其要旨，在求即糧食之數量及價格俾維持生產與消費之均衡，蓋依糧食統制法之規定，政府先設標準價格，在於米價　貴超於標準價格以上，或低落全於標準價格以下時，始得出，或收買之。此種方策，以便杜絕市塲黑市米價之存在；而另一方面，盡以收買之米予以補充配給之不足，今日，試　上海米市行情，市民除以十日一次領給標準價格少量糧食之外，則每日伸頸徬徨於高速度之黑市米價　此種原因，皆因政府統制無力，而致流弊於此，其爲害不淺也。</p>

<h3>Several Practical Problems in Current Education</h3>
<p>Modern countries pay great attention to the establishment of a solid foundation and reasonable development of primary and secondary school education. Primary and secondary education is the foundation of national education. If a country wants to establish itself in the world, it should pay special attention to it. In recent years, through the efforts of government education authorities and people in the private education sector, my country's primary and secondary school education has gradually progressed from the embryonic stage to the development stage. From an overall perspective, although the proportion of students enrolled in school among all school-age children in the country is alarming, and the ratio of the national land area to the number of schools is chilling, the efforts made by the people of the country in establishing the foundation of primary and secondary education and promoting the cause of primary and secondary education in a short period of time are undeniable. Of course, we need to make continuous efforts to popularize primary and secondary education and provide all school-age children in the country with the opportunity to be educated.</p>
<p>What was said above concerns the quantitative aspect of primary and secondary education, which should be popularized. However, the equally important qualitative aspect should also be noted, especially in the current period when it has not yet been popularized, to establish a foundation of excellent quality, gradually expand it in the future, and maintain the simultaneous progress of quality and quantity. Therefore, today we should always pay special attention to the practical problems of the quality of primary and secondary education.</p>
<p>Before discussing practical problems, in order to emphasize the urgency of paying attention to this issue, let us make a broad observation. The disease of our country today lies in poverty; the disease of the people lies in the lack of modern knowledge, and the lack of knowledge of production learning and production skills. The phenomenon of national poverty and the people's lack of modern knowledge manifests on the surface of society as chaos and disturbances. Therefore, the quality of today's education, especially the quality of primary and secondary education, does not lie in simply moving educational principles, doctrines, and school systems from the West that do not conform to our national conditions, but in imparting students with practical and needed knowledge. This enables individuals to rely on it for a living, and enables the country and society to embark on the path of construction and evolution. However, what education shows today is that some universities are simply places for wealthy children to spend their leisure time, and simply ladders for wealthy children to seek fame and fortune. Because the purpose is to spend leisure time, teachers inevitably indulge students, and students become accustomed to neglecting their studies and indulging in extravagance, talking about socializing, discussing love, and enjoying singing and dancing, which has become a trend. Because the purpose is to seek fame and fortune, schools have become training grounds for competing for fame and fortune. They are ignorant of the country's status and the situation, and even more so of their academic performance. As for the majority of secondary schools, they have no independence at all and seem to be solely for preparing for admission to university. What they learn is isolated from practical life and is purely decorative knowledge from books. Because of their lack of independence, in addition to a small number of wealthy children who can be admitted to university to complete their dream of decorating their facade and seeking fame, the majority of those who cannot afford to go to university easily become vagrants who are useless and have no skills. Some people have criticized that the education of the past few decades has changed from "earthly eight-legged essays" to "foreign eight-legged essays," and from "earthly imperial examinations" to "foreign imperial examinations." It has no relationship with the actual society, and it has nothing to do with the lives of the educated themselves. If we earnestly examine the general situation of today's education sector, if we do not try to cover it up, we will probably be ashamed and unable to answer for ourselves. In essence, today's education is pulling young people out of society and separating them from practical life, rather than leading young people into society to solve their own and all the problems of society. It is to increase the desire of young people to live and lead them into the dead end of extravagance, uselessness, and incompetence, rather than guiding young people to embark on the path of production and construction. Therefore, the more education there is, the poorer the country becomes, and the more painful the people become.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the most developed place for education in the country, and it is also a place that can influence the educational trends of other parts of the country. In the past, it was long influenced by British and American colors, and the educational methods and goals were not suitable for our national conditions. Now that British and American forces have been eliminated, the British and American colors in education should also be eliminated, and the only prerequisite for establishing educational policies should be to suit our national conditions and social needs. Based on this premise, we put forward several practical problems in current education for everyone to discuss: The age of junior high school and elementary school students is generally under five years old, especially some elementary school students are under ten years old. The types of homework are both complicated and the learning hours are long. At the same time, they also need to study Japanese and English. In addition to their native language, they need to study two foreign languages, which is extremely unsuitable for children who have not fully developed and whose brains are not fully developed. According to our experience, it is absolutely difficult for young children to digest English, which only wastes children's brainpower and affects the learning of other subjects. Therefore, we advocate that elementary schools should absolutely not study foreign languages, and junior high schools and above should start to study necessary foreign languages appropriately. The current English curriculum in middle schools should be reduced.</p>
<p>Junior high school and elementary school students are still young, and their physical strength is not sufficient. The homework is heavy. We must consider whether they can bear the burden. For the sake of the physical health of school-age children, we advocate reducing the complexity of the types of subjects and focusing on thorough teaching. It is better to have less and be refined, and fully understand, than to have more and be shoddy and unable to digest.</p>
<p>The importance of physical education is no different from moral and intellectual education. To have solid knowledge, one must have a strong physique in order to use it continuously. A weak physique, even with abundant knowledge, is difficult to last. At present, most schools in Shanghai are facing difficulties due to their environmental status, and physical education has been completely abolished. The physical training of students is indeed a serious problem. In any case, the school authorities should find ways to remedy it.</p>
<p>The equipment for practical experiments in natural sciences is crude and simple, and in some cases, there is none at all. It is not difficult to imagine the difficulties and isolation in future applications when book knowledge cannot be verified. Government agencies should raise funds to enrich the equipment and lend it to various schools for use. In principle, it is already difficult to reduce practical time due to insufficient equipment, let alone having no practical experience at all?</p>
<p>University students have reached a stage where they can accept rigorous training in terms of age, physical strength, and thinking. The current university education should be given special wartime training, and wartime knowledge and skills, in particular, must be absolutely strict in life management. We previously advocated on June 8 that male students should shave their heads, not wear suits, not wear fancy clothes, and not wear leather shoes. Female students should not perm their hair or use face powder. We are not trying to overcorrect things or deliberately put on airs. We really feel that the key to reforming educational methods is to start with strict life management.</p>

<h3>The Situation on the Eastern Front is Muddy and Protracted; Soviet Offensive Intensifies; Plan to Encircle German Troops Fails</h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Havas, German military officials announced last night that the continued Soviet reinforcements at the Kupiansk bridgehead and the Dnieper bridgehead north of the Sea of Azov are due to their deep fear of the coming muddy season, and a desire to achieve a decisive breakthrough before then. However, their fierce attacks to break through and encircle the German troops have not succeeded and have been repelled by the German army.</p>
<p>Intense Fighting on the Banks of the Dnieper River</p>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Havas, the main focus of the Soviet offensive on the Eastern Front is still between the Sosna and Upper Dnieper Rivers. The German army is continuing to shift to new positions and resisting. The enemy repeatedly attempted to break through the German flanks with strong tanks and infantry, but ultimately failed due to the German army's flexible defense strategy. The southern wing, between the Dnieper Bay and the Sea of Azov, is now under the command of General von Manstein. After receiving reinforcements, he is determined to repel the enemy's offensive. Although the fighting is intense, it has reached a stalemate.

In terms of the overall situation on the Eastern Front, the Soviet army is responding calmly and using flexible strategies, and has now strengthened its defensive capabilities.</p>
<h3>Goebbels Reaffirms Determination to Strive for Victory; Justice and Force Will Ultimately Demonstrate Their Effectiveness</h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels published an article in this week's "Das Reich" magazine, entitled "When the Time Comes," stating, "We are not afraid of the enemy. We not only possess justice but also force. When the time comes, both justice and force will demonstrate their effectiveness." The minister pointed out, "In the current widespread conflicts, no belligerent nation can avoid experiencing at least one fatal crisis. For example, Britain after Dunkirk, the Soviet Union when German forces were about to encircle Moscow, and the United States after Pearl Harbor and the loss of the Philippines, are all such cases."</p>
<p>Endure Setbacks and Never Yield</p>
<p>Goebbels explained, "It is not surprising that we Germans have encountered similar trials in this war. Generally speaking, we are more capable of overcoming these hardships materially than our enemies, because we possess abundant reserves that can be continuously drawn upon." However, Goebbels warned that endurance in the face of setbacks and losses requires a kind of training that the Germans still lack. Goebbels stated, "The enemy constantly seeks to persuade the Germans that they have no hope of victory and mocks their optimistic expectations, believing that this will make the Germans yield, because no amount of military pressure can make them yield."</p>
<p>No Need to Argue About Who Initiated the War</p>
<p>The article also addressed the enemy's claim that they did not initiate this war and their attempt to completely shift the blame to the Germans. Goebbels recalled the serious crisis that engulfed Europe before the war, the subtle signs of which were the cause of the war, and reminded readers of how the enemy patiently waited for the right opportunity and how eagerly and frantically they prepared. Goebbels declared, "The reason we have earned the enemy's anger and hatred is because we have observed this danger and taken appropriate steps to deal with it. The enemy accuses us of initiating the war simply because we resisted their attempts to strangle us." All of this is very obvious and has been confirmed by the enemy's own declared war aims. Today, these war aims are empty words. If we had not armed ourselves, these war aims would have been realized long ago.</p>
<p>Fight with All Our Might for the Right to Survive</p>
<p>"There is only one way to end this war and return to genuine peace: the victory of Germany," Goebbels asserted. "If there is a nation in history that is determined to end its forced war with victory, it is the people of Germany today." Goebbels continued, "The more the enemy uses terror to deprive us of the necessities and pleasures of life, the simpler our standard of living will become, and the more unconditionally we will insist on our demands." Goebbels solemnly declared, "No force in the world can compel us to abandon our fundamental rights to a free, independent life and the possibility of development." Goebbels also discussed the trials and sacrifices that the German people have endured in this war, as well as their determination and increased strength, stating, "The enemy is mistaken if they believe that the Germans are tired of war or exhausted by it. In any case, the Germans show these signs less than their enemies."</p>
<p>Western European Fortress, Enemy Cemetery</p>
<p>Goebbels warned, "If a group of journalists in London are bragging about the absurd story of marching in formation to Berlin, then we only want to point out that there is still plenty of room among the three and a half-meter-thick blocks of the Atlantic Wall to serve as a large cemetery for British soldiers. The Anglo-American terror bombing of German civilians is clearly the idea of British politicians, but we want to point out that any blow against us will inevitably be reciprocated. Our retaliation may be slow at times, but it will eventually be carried out, often when the enemy has already put the matter behind them. We feel that this attitude and view are perfectly reasonable, because we know that our military strength is sufficient, and sooner or later, it will not be a problem. This war is different from World War I and cannot be won with lies and deception. The enemy has already attacked us, but we will not yield."</p>
<h3>Japanese Special Transport Ship Launched</h3>

<h3>The Kugan Drama Troupe Returns to Shanghai Soon; Charity Performance for the Newspaper's Scholarship Fund; World-Famous Play "Gone with the Wind" to be Performed First at the Paris Grand Theater</h3>
<p>Since its inception, the newspaper's reader scholarship fund has been held for five sessions, with enthusiastic support from all sectors of society, achieving remarkable results. In particular, the donations received this year exceeded 2.2 million yuan, benefiting more than 4,000 students, breaking all previous records. The colleagues are deeply inspired and are willing to do their best to promote scholarship work in order to fulfill their duty to serve society. However, in order to universally assist poor students, it is necessary to replenish the scholarship funds. The newspaper colleagues, recognizing this, intend to open up other fundraising avenues besides public solicitation. They have specially invited the renowned Kugan Drama Troupe to perform for a long period of time. The proceeds from ticket sales, after deducting necessary expenses, will be allocated to the scholarship fund. The members of the Kugan Drama Troupe are highly skilled, well-trained, and have always been the top drama troupe in Shanghai. In recent years, the plays "Metamorphosis," "The Great Circus," and "Autumn Begonia" performed in Shanghai have been very popular (although the troupe name is different, the current Kugan members are actually the backbone of each play). At the end of August this fall, after the Kugan and Lanxin partnership expired, they were invited to perform in Beijing for a month, gaining a reputation. They are now scheduled to return to Shanghai on the same day this month. At the invitation of this newspaper, they will perform regularly for the scholarship fund, showing their spirit of righteousness and courage, which is commendable.</p>
<p>The charity performance venue is the centrally located Paris Grand Theater. The first play is the world-famous "Gone with the Wind" (i.e., "Gone with the Wind" during the war). During their month in Beijing, the Kugan Troupe rehearsed the great five-act, seven-scene play "Gone with the Wind" in their spare time. The premiere is imminent, and those who love drama and art in Shanghai will surely want to be among the first to see it. The Kugan Troupe's lineup is also something that readers will be happy to hear about, and is listed below: Director and screenwriter Huang Zuolin, Yao Ke. Technical director Wu Renzhi. Stage manager Sun Haoran. Actors Shi Hui, Shi Yuan, Wang Jun, Bai Wen, Bai Mu, Chen Ping, Jingang, Le Yao, Danny, Shen Min, Shangguan Yunzhu, Mochou, Lin Zhen, Lin Bin, Ma Xiaonong, Lan Xian, Yingzi, Zhuang Yan, Sun Song, etc.</p>
<h3>Hirota's Announcement: A Discourse on the Global War Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the regular joint press conference of the Army and Navy Overseas Affairs Bureau in Shanghai was held as scheduled. Mr. Hirota, Chief of the Information Section of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, and Vice Consul Fukuwen, among others, attended. At the conference, Chief Hirota presented his observations on the current global war situation, delivering the following discourse:</p>
<p>The European and Asian War Situations</p>
<p>Hirota began by stating, "The present world war situation is in a certain phase. In both the European and Asian theaters, there has been evidence of counter-offensive operations by the anti-Axis powers. This is to be expected in this stage of the global conflict. However, what we must particularly note is that this counter-offensive by the anti-Axis forces should not be regarded as a general offensive. Therefore, the war situation announced by the anti-Axis powers is a serious misrepresentation and is becoming increasingly evident. From the overall perspective of the war situation, it is even more clear that the Axis powers are adopting a position of full initiative. Thus, the so-called counter-offensive announced by the anti-Axis powers has actually yielded completely negative results. Regarding the operations in the southwestern Pacific, such as those in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, the anti-Axis side believes they are extremely successful, but in reality, they have achieved nothing. Furthermore, concerning the situation in the northern Aleutian Islands, the Japanese troops stationed on Attu Island have already completed their sacred mission and established an imperishable and great achievement. Yet, the anti-Axis side again exaggerates their claims. If we look at the map, the anti-Axis advance over the past year and the great gains made by Japan since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the distance covered by the anti-Axis forces is only a tiny fraction, perhaps one-tenth, of what Japan has achieved."</p>
<p>The Final Victory</p>
<p>He then proceeded to explain the situation in Europe, stating that when the German army launched its offensive against France, it directly attacked the Maginot Line. At that time, the anti-Axis side observed that the German army would be blocked and unable to penetrate it. But in fact, the German army advanced like a bamboo splitting, easily breaking through the Maginot Line. Later, there were further foolish observations that the anti-Axis powers could cause Germany to collapse before 1943, and then subjugate Japan within the two years of 1944 and 1945. This propaganda only proves that Germany not only shows no signs of collapse, but its war power is becoming even stronger. The Axis powers' observations of the anti-Axis powers' fortunes have never been wrong, and their measures have been accurate. There is no doubt that they will seize victory.</p>
<p>Spreading Rumors</p>
<p>Mr. Hirota further explained that the Axis powers are now in a position of full initiative, which is an obvious fact. The exaggerated propaganda of the anti-Axis powers is even harder to believe. The anti-Axis powers have recently been spreading rumors, creating an atmosphere of peace to appease the Axis powers, which is even more contemptible. Moreover, in an attempt to resolve internal divisions, the anti-Axis powers have convened meetings and proposed methods of obliterating rights and interests in order to prepare for a long-term war. However, the Axis powers have long been prepared for this. With fierce fighting, we are confident that the Axis powers will achieve final victory. Judging from the current war situation, the Axis powers will certainly establish a dominant position. At the same time, I hope everyone will pay special attention to the recent announcement by the Japanese government of the establishment of the Ministry of Munitions, which will further strengthen Japan's domestic war system. On the other hand, the cooperative relationship between the Greater East Asian nations is becoming increasingly solid. Our long-term war system is already in place. In Europe, Germany's industrial development is truly astonishing. They are now reforming submarines and new types of aircraft and preparing to mass-produce these new weapons, which will exert a tremendous force in future operations against the anti-Axis powers. We should look forward to the early appearance of Germany's new weapons.</p>
<h3>Printed and Distributed by Director Ku Ch'i: Mr. Nie's Work, "Preserving Wealth" - Our Newspaper Accepts Donations for 20,000 Copies for Immediate Sale</h3>
<p>The article "Preserving Wealth" was written by Buddhist layman Nie Yunhe during his illness. Its profound meaning is truly sufficient to correct the hearts of the people in this world. It was previously published in this newspaper last winter and was greatly appreciated by readers. Many letters were received requesting donations to print it as a separate publication, but due to the soaring price of paper, it was difficult to raise sufficient funds. Fortunately, Master Ku Chai was moved to exhort the world and generously offered his assistance, donating 100,000 yuan exclusively. He chose to use domestically produced printing and writing paper and commissioned the Taiping Printing Company to print 50,000 copies, which were published and distributed at the end of September. Our newspaper accepted donations for 20,000 copies and is selling them at cost in the business department for two yuan per copy. All proceeds will be used to support education and alleviate poverty. Furthermore, Master Ku Chai has specified that all donors to the newspaper's education fund, small loan fund, street children's aid fund, elderly aid fund, marriage aid fund, funeral loan fund, winter account, and Chao-Shan disaster relief fund, regardless of the amount of their donation, will each receive a copy. Additional copies will be sent to various organizations, schools, and trade associations in Shanghai and other cities. People from all walks of life should each possess a copy as a precious guide to navigating life.</p>

All proceeds will be donated to China-Japan-France-Portugal charitable organizations.</p>
<p>Yesterday's report was filed at 7:40 PM</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>National Federation of Commerce</h3>
<p>We have previously stated that more advanced social and economic conditions depend on the efforts of leaders in the economic sphere. Economic leaders are not only leaders in economic undertakings but also leaders in economic thought. Therefore, they must have a thorough understanding of the people's lives and intentions. They should make as many suggestions and contributions as possible, provided that they do not harm the government and benefit the people, for anything that is required by the times and the environment. They need not worry that the people will not support them or that the government will not accept them.</p>
<p>Enlightened figures in Shanghai's business community believe that the implementation of the government's economic policies relies on the support of unified commercial organizations from various regions. Therefore, they plan to initiate the establishment of a National Federation of Commerce. The method is to have the chambers of commerce of Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Bengbu, and Nanjing act as initiators and apply to the government for legal approval. Before the war, there was an organization called the National Federation of Commerce, whose purpose was to convey the government's intentions upward and communicate the situation of merchants and people downward. After the war, due to various reasons, this organization ceased to exist. The only organization that can communicate the opinions of officials and merchants is the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the establishment of the National Association for the Control of Commerce, the general public did not fully understand the relationship between the powers of the Association for the Control of Commerce and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. After explanation by influential parties, it was understood that the Association for the Control of Commerce is the highest controlling body for the purchase and distribution of Chinese goods, implementing control matters in accordance with government instructions, while the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is the representative of the Shanghai business community, responsible for making suggestions and providing assistance to the authorities, and can also serve as a channel for communication between officials and the people. Therefore, several resolutions recently adopted by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce can be said to represent its core work. The task of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is like this, and so is the task of the National Federation of Commerce, except that the scope represented by the latter is wider, and the expression of its opinions is more centralized and transparent.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that the National Federation of Commerce will be realized as soon as possible, so that national economic leaders can gather together to use their rational ideas to achieve a comprehensive coordination of the opinions of the government and the people, and a fundamental solution to social and economic problems.</p>
<p>Purchase of Wheat: Small Loans with Discount Guarantee Approved by Syndicate - Guarantee to Purchase Wheat for Specific Use</p>
<p>After the Specialty Committee for Flour and Wheat monopolized the purchase of wheat in three provinces and two cities, the Chinese banking syndicate and Japanese banks made loans, stipulating that all manufacturers and entrusted merchants could enter into discount agreements with the syndicate. The discount method is as follows:</p>
<p>The discounter borrows funds from the banking syndicate for discounting, guaranteeing that the funds will be used solely for purchasing wheat and not for other purposes. If the draft is not paid at maturity, or if the payment is insufficient, or if a dispute arises, the discounter is willing to be responsible for repaying the discounted loan, together with all expenses incurred as a result and overdue interest calculated at the discount rate, and will not evade responsibility. If the discounter violates or fails to fulfill the first and second clauses of this contract, the banking syndicate may, without notice, directly dispose of and sell the discounter's funds and property, in whatever name, deposited in the member banks of the banking syndicate, as well as the discounter's own assets, whether movable or immovable, regardless of where they are stored, provided that the banking syndicate confirms that they belong to the discounter. The discounter will have no objection, and if there is a shortfall, the discounter will continue to repay it in full. If there is a surplus, it should be returned to the discounter by the banking syndicate. If the property disposed of and sold belongs to a member bank, all expenses will be borne by the member banks. All receipts issued to the discounter by the member banks will be invalidated. The banking syndicate may rediscount the above-mentioned balances with the Central Reserve Bank. The discounter shall fulfill the terms and conditions stipulated in this contract to the banking syndicate, and shall also fulfill them to the Central Reserve Bank. The place where the banking syndicate is located is the place of performance of this contract. Any matters not covered by this contract shall be handled in accordance with the discount contract of the Specialty Committee for Flour and Wheat, and the established practices of the banking industry shall also apply.</p>

<h3>Relevant Authorities Considering Loans for Yarn and Cloth Businesses</h3>
<p>Since the government implemented the purchase and trade of cotton yarn and cloth, textile companies and general merchants engaged in cotton yarn and cotton cloth have felt the pain of economic inflexibility. This has had a profound impact on the Shanghai market. It is said that the relevant authorities, recognizing this situation, are now considering loan measures to alleviate the financial difficulties of merchants in the textile and yarn-cloth industries. Although the specific details of the measures have not been decided, the general framework that has been determined is as follows: Merchants engaged in textiles or yarn-cloth, who must borrow due to tight credit conditions, may borrow credit loans after approval by the relevant authorities. The above-mentioned credit loans will be handled by banks. Once the specific measures are decided, they can be implemented.</p>

<h3>Opinions on the Food Problem —Special Transfer No. 2—</h3>
<p>The ancients said, "The people regard food as heaven." This shows that the food problem existed in ancient times, not just since today. However, in this era of constant turmoil, it has become even more severe and acute. Now, the author wishes to offer, with the most sincere heart and honest intention, several points regarding the current government's improper and flawed implementation of food administration, and the aspects that need improvement. These are summarized below, hoping that the authorities will consider and adopt some of them. There is absolutely no intention to maliciously attack or criticize.</p>
<p>Key Points of Abuse:</p>
<p>Evasion of Responsibility by Food Administration Agencies.</p>
<p>The original rationed amount was already felt by the citizens to be grossly insufficient. They hoped that the authorities would increase the allocation and improve the situation, even more desperately than hoping for rain in a severe drought. Who knew that since the last two and a half months, the rationed amount has actually decreased by half or even more. (In the 75 days from July 1st to September 15th, District 18 only received seven rations, totaling seven and a half *sheng* of mixed rice. The old urban area received even less.) According to the past talks and statements by the leaders of the Shanghai Joint Cooperative and the Grain Bureau, the reasons are nothing more than: lack of funds, lack of transportation equipment, and failure of the Ministry of Food to allocate rice, resulting in the inability to distribute on time and in the required quantities. But who is responsible for raising funds? Who is responsible for handling transportation? And who is designating the rice for the people? These various matters each have dedicated personnel responsible for them. The dereliction of duty of one official or clerk affects the lives of millions of people in the entire city. How can the government ignore and tolerate this, allowing those responsible to evade their responsibilities without investigation?</p>
<p>Points for Improvement:</p>
<p>Strengthen Agencies, Clarify Responsibilities, and Strictly Define Rewards and Punishments. The author believes that while strengthening the organization of food administration agencies is of primary importance, clarifying responsibilities to specialize authority, and strictly defining rewards and punishments to provide a basis for commendation and discipline, are also absolutely necessary. For example, since the Ministry of Food is the overall governing agency, it must make every effort to respond to the requests for rice allocation from various counties and cities. The rationing agencies in each county and city must also uphold a fair and honest sense of responsibility to serve the country and the people. If dereliction of duty, embezzlement, or corruption occur, the authorities must, with the utmost determination, break through personal connections and strictly punish and warn, without any favoritism. Those who achieve outstanding results should be given special and glorious commendations to encourage and inspire others.</p>
<p>Key Points of Abuse:</p>
<p>Unlawful Grain Purchases.</p>
<p>The current methods of purchasing rice and grain in various rural areas lack legal standards, and the purchase prices have not been publicly announced. As a result, among the general personnel purchasing rice and grain, it is difficult to guarantee that there are no unscrupulous elements who take the opportunity to act in the public interest for private gain, such as forcibly demanding allocations, offering excessively low prices, confiscating under false pretenses, and using coercion, etc., in countless ways. As a result, farmers fear them like tigers and wolves, secretly hiding the harvested grain in caves. Those who use scales have also changed to planting other crops because of this situation. Under these circumstances, to talk about increasing production is no different from climbing a tree to catch fish.</p>
<p>Points for Improvement:</p>
<p>Establish Purchase Standards and Prices, and Strictly Manage Personnel.</p>
<p>The standards and prices for purchasing rice and grain must be strictly stipulated by the authorities and clearly announced to avoid exploitation. Strict management of personnel involved in purchasing is also essential. It should be clearly ordered that if anyone is found to be using excuses to oppress, forcibly purchase, or failing to pay the specified purchase price, the victims can appeal to the local authorities for relief to protect the legitimate interests of the farmers. In this way, the government can easily obtain the close cooperation of the majority of farmers. Without promoting and encouraging increased production, the yield will increase on its own. In addition, farmers who produce more grain than a certain amount should be given a partial or full exemption from taxes as an incentive. As for bartering publicly purchased cotton cloth and sugar, which farmers eagerly await, in proportion to the amount of grain they sell, according to the market price, can also achieve the effect of encouraging sales.</p>
<p>Key Points of Abuse:</p>
<p>Lack of Local Reserves to Prepare for Potential Shortages and Delays.</p>
<p>Currently, Shanghai has no facilities for storing grain. The grain rationed to the people is only a small amount that has just been transported in. Therefore, once a problem occurs, it affects the lives of all citizens, and the black market becomes rampant. Unscrupulous elements within the food agencies further fuel the flames, embezzling and smuggling to sell on the black market. As rations are suspended, reduced, or delayed, the black market becomes increasingly inflated. These unscrupulous elements profit even more from private smuggling and sales, and there is no hope for improvement in the regular rations. This vicious cycle has created an extremely serious situation. The government cannot deny its culpability for oversight and mismanagement.</p>
<p>Points for Improvement:</p>
<p>Actively Store Grain and Suppress the Black Market.</p>
<p>The immediate plan should be to purchase and transport as much grain as possible to meet needs. On the one hand, in addition to gradually restoring the previous amount of unpaid rice and supplementing the rations, it should also be gradually increased to the amount needed for normal human consumption, that is, about 1.5 *dou* per person per month. In addition, a certain amount should be reserved each month, aiming to purchase and transport enough grain within every two months to meet the needs of the entire city for three months. In this way, within six months, enough grain can be pre-stored to meet the needs of the entire city for three months. Even if accidents occur in the future, it can be handled easily. As for the crackdown on the black market, if it can be thoroughly eliminated, on the one hand, farmers can only sell what they have to the government at the official price. On the other hand, it can eliminate the attempts of unscrupulous people to smuggle and sell privately. However, this move should be implemented strictly and eliminated only after first ensuring that "the people have enough to eat," to avoid public unrest.</p>
<p>Key Points of Abuse:</p>
<p>Rations Include Sandy Flour and Moldy Rice, Affecting Health; the Grade of Rations is Ambiguous.</p>
<p>The majority of rice rationed in the past has been of poor quality and mixed with a lot of sand and gravel. Even flour is sometimes mixed with sand. Although some of it may be inherently unclean, it is difficult to guarantee that unscrupulous elements are not mixing it in to increase the weight of the rice and flour. However, rice can still be cleaned with some effort, but what can be done with flour except swallow it without chewing? This concerns the health of the people; how can it be taken lightly! In addition, the wording in the public notices issued at the time of rationing is often ambiguous, giving unscrupulous rice shops the opportunity to change the grade. For example, "Each person will be rationed half a *sheng* of white rice or brown rice and half a *sheng* of broken rice." The food rationed to citizens should prioritize not harming health, and the grades must be clearly defined to prevent exploitation.</p>
<p>If the rice and wheat rations are insufficient, they can be supplemented with auxiliary grains that do not harm health, such as red beans, broad beans, soy beans, and mung beans. In general, those mixed with sand, soil, and mold that are unfit for consumption should absolutely not be rationed. The strength of the people's physique is the strength of the nation. The authorities should keep this in mind and ensure the health of the people. At the same time, the public notices at the time of rationing should clearly specify "X grade white rice so much and X grade X rice so much," avoiding vague and ambiguous wording as much as possible, so that unscrupulous people have no way to use their tricks of "stealing the sky and changing the sun."</p>
<p>Key Points of Abuse:</p>
<p>Inaccurate Calculation of Rice Using *Sheng* and *Dou*.</p>
<p>In China, it is customary to use *sheng* and *dou* as the standard for measuring rice. According to regulations, each market *shi* should weigh 156 market *jin* net, and each market *sheng* should weigh about 1 *jin*, 8 *liang*, 9 *qian*, and 6 *fen* on the market scale. However, various stores, aware of the public's lack of knowledge about its specific gravity, arbitrarily deduct the weight, rarely providing the full weight. Although some citizens who are aware of this have negotiated with them, the rice shop clerks mostly use the excuse that the rationing is based on *sheng* and *dou*, leaving them helpless. The amount secretly reduced is about 0.5%.</p>
<p>Points for Improvement:</p>
<p>Change from *Sheng* and *Dou* to *Jin* and *Liang*.</p>
<p>To avoid this abuse, the rations can be changed from the *sheng* and *dou* system to calculation by *jin* and *liang*. The same applies to flour rations. Because the market scale is commonly used by every household, unlike the *sheng* and *dou*, which are exclusively prepared by rice shops.</p>
<p>Key Points of Abuse:</p>
<p>Improper Appointment of Food Administration Personnel.</p>
<p>The reason why our country's politics cannot be reformed is due to the poor governance of officials, which is a fact that no one can deny. Those who have the opportunity to profit from the public will do everything possible to achieve it. Taking hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars in property as a personal gain is seen as normal and not shameful. This phenomenon has continued from the late Qing Dynasty to the early Republic, and from the early Republic to the present. The authorities' appointment of officials still cannot escape the relationships of hometown ties, private friendships, factions, and personal favors. They have not yet adopted "ability" and "integrity" as the standards for evaluation and recruitment. Food administration is no exception; how can it not be corrupt!</p>
<p>Points for Improvement:</p>
<p>Food Administration Agencies Should Be Jointly Managed by Officials and the People, and a Supervisory Committee Should Be Established Separately.</p>
<p>The food administration agencies have now been reformed and reorganized: local celebrities and people of standing are appointed to full-time positions. However, it cannot be guaranteed that all celebrities and people of standing are honest and incorruptible. Their past conduct and character must be carefully observed before they are formally appointed. In addition, a supervisory committee must be established separately to conduct inspections from time to time. The candidates can be composed of impartial people from various public community organizations, such as associations or unions in the press, academia, and business. They will exercise their transcendent supervisory power to eliminate all possible abuses and achieve perfection.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The ancient Confucian scholar Mencius said: "There is a way to gain the empire: gain the people, and you will gain the empire. There is a way to gain the people: gain their hearts, and you will gain the people. There is a way to gain their hearts: gather for them what they desire, and do not impose on them what they hate." Improving food administration is to stabilize people's livelihoods. Stabilizing livelihoods is the most important task of the current government. I hope that those who govern today will repeatedly contemplate these words!</p>
<h3>New Adjustments and Strategies for Shanghai's Food Rationing System (1)</h3>
<p>— Huang Chuisheng</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen said in the Outline of National Reconstruction: "The top priority of national reconstruction is the people's livelihood. Therefore, the government should cooperate with the people to jointly promote the development of agriculture to satisfy the people's food needs, jointly promote the development of weaving to enrich the people's clothing, construct various types of houses on a large scale to benefit the people's housing, and repair roads and canals to facilitate the people's transportation." Our country has always attached great importance to the food problem, from the government to the people. The Book of Songs says: "Then we inspect the wine cellars, the wine jars, and the grain. Then we begin to set out." This shows the importance of food, as "the people can go without goods for a hundred years, but they cannot go hungry for a day."</p>
<p>Since the war, Shanghai has been cut off from the outside world and isolated internally. The food problem has suddenly become a major and serious case. The reasons for this are: 1. The phenomenon of food shortage. 2. The imbalance between rising prices and farmers' livelihoods. 3. The shrinking scope of agricultural land. 4. The reduction in production. 5. The interruption of transportation. 6. Harsh taxes. 7. Large-scale hoarding. 8. Population increase. As a result, rice merchants in recent years are indeed profit-driven. They only know themselves and not others. Their goal is to make profits, and they use making profits as their purpose. They seek profits in every possible way, thinking of increasing profits even in this chaotic world, "climbing to the top and looking around." This is the time for profiteers to be successful. Since Shanghai implemented the policy of rationing food according to the number of people last July, the rationing system has not yet been perfected, placing the people's lives and health outside of consideration, and creating extremely high market rice prices and black market prices. This is the failure of the rationing organization. Let's look at "Last year, Jiangsu Construction Ying published 13 million *mu* of rural land, slightly producing 33 million *shi*, and 8 million *shi* of small grain rice, not less than 22 million *shi*, and 6 million *shi*. The Shanghai City territory, such as Fengxian, Gaoding, Chongming, Jinshan, Nanhui, and Beiqiao districts, should also produce 5 to 6 million *shi* of rice. In addition, the Shanghai population of 5 million people, about 11.5 million people in total, requires 23 million *shi* of rice per year, with an average consumption of 2 *shi* per person. The rice from the Jiangsu Qingxiang District and the Shanghai City territory is slightly more than enough to meet the supply and demand. (See the Economic Review in the Shen Bao newspaper on September 10th regarding the food problem.)" The above confirms that there should be no doubt about the food self-sufficiency problem in Jiangsu Province. In addition to flour and miscellaneous grains, there should be no need to worry about shortages if supplementary rations are added and adjusted periodically. However, today, all citizens of Shanghai are suffering from the food problem. The reasons can be divided into the following, and the future solutions will be briefly described for discussion.</p>
<p>The Unsoundness of the Food Control Organization—Food control is to adopt control policies for the production, consumption, and price of food. The main purpose is to seek to maintain the balance between production and consumption in terms of the quantity and price of food. According to the provisions of the Food Control Law, the government first sets standard prices. When the rice price is higher than the standard price or lower than the standard price, it can be sold or purchased. This policy is to prevent the existence of black market rice prices. On the other hand, all the purchased rice is used to supplement the insufficient rations. Today, if we look at the Shanghai rice market situation, in addition to receiving a small amount of food at the standard price once every ten days, citizens stretch their necks and linger at the high-speed black market rice price every day. This reason is all due to the government's lack of control, which leads to malpractice here, which is no small harm.</p>
