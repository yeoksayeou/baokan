<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">論國家興衰之道 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>凡執國政者，必關切其國家興衰之道，所以大政治家應該時時刻刻戒愼恐懼，高瞻遠矚，不安於小成，不疏於星火，而尤其重要的是緊記住孟子所說：「天視自我民視，天聽自我民聽，」惟恐和人民疏遠了，陷國家於危亡的窮途。我們並不想危言聳聞，也不願空唱高調，然而就目前政局而言，不得不向當局進一諍言者。</p>
<p>從目前大局來看，確是我國翻身的千古難遇的時代，特別是在這東亞戰局穩定，友邦日本實施對華新政策，使我們擺脫了百年來英美所加的桎梏之今日，政府當局固然沒有誇功的宣傳，我們相信只要是中國人，沒有不因此對政府增加信賴的。這是說國際政治形勢之有利。次之從內政看，如戰時體制之逐漸確立，中央政權之逐漸强化，都足以預示國家前途的有爲。</p>
<p>但是上述國際和國內的新形勢，是否就可自滿自足呢？我們相信賢明的政府當局，決不作此想的。相反，從對外說，隨着世界戰局之進展，和國際形勢之演化，參戰後的我國，對於大東亞軸心國所應負担起來的責任，眞可說是：「任重道遠」，我們曾經準備和實行了多少呢？老實說太平洋的保衛任務，至今還只由日本一國支持着。再從對內說，西南有重慶之負嵎，西北有共黨之猖獗；中州則赤地千里，災民有偕亡之痛；東南則百廢待舉，而財才皆感不足；所謂完成中國建設，安定東亞後方，還只在開步與發軔時期，都有待於政府領袖之負弩前驅，爲民表率，而目前的政治機構，政綱政策和人才，是否已能勝任愉快，誰能作絕對肯定的答覆。</p>
<p>無論對內對外，要圓滿解答上述幾個問題，絕「必亡之道」而求「必存之術」，主要的是需要一個强有力的中央政府，具有充分向心力的中央政府，具體的說，也就是强化國民政府，使能更確實更充分的袒負與完成新時代的使命。但是從目前的事實而論，今日的國民政府，其本質不是直接對選民或對國會負責的政府，其組織系統與國策政令的實施不是自下而上，而是自上而下的。我們今日不討論這種政府機構的良善與否的問題，但我們不能不鄭重地指出，由於這種政治體制與組織的特點，我們要求其强化，發揮其最大的效能，那就首先必須要求政府機構中每一個成員，從最高領袖到下級幹部，人人都能倣全國人民的模範，樹立廉潔整肅的政治風氣，同時力求政府一切機構之健全，自上而下的整個系統的靈敏，各級機構和各平行機構之間的密切協同，使政府像一架靈活的機器，像一個健康的人身那樣，不僅最高當局能依據具體的客觀現實與主觀條件而定出最適當的國策政令等等，而且各級能夠澈底了解和迅速切實的推行貫澈。我們希望政府不僅在形式上法令上，而且要從實際的組織上，在每一個政府成員的行動上，表現出政府確實是一個强力的政府，能夠担負起新時代所賦與的對內對外的一切任務，而且實際上可以不貢人民之希望。那麼，國民政府的產生，雖然還沒有經過民選的形式，但是政府內部及政府與人民間的聯系的緊密，則可以無愧於當代强國—日德諸國的政府，而充分代表中華民國全體人民的利益，政府完全建立在全體國民堅決擁護的基礎之上。那時，政府與人民具有血肉痛癢密切相關的聯繫，「朝」有「民溺己溺」之心，「野」有「國辱民死」之志，就能實現眞正的從精神到物質的「總力動員」，完成參戰建國的使命。</p>
<p>我們所說的固然是政治理論，但是，也正是歷代政治史實所顯示的基本原則，並且是目前世界戰爭之現實的結論。太平天國初期的成功，是因爲領導者接受這歷史的鐵則，而其失敗就是領導者違反這個原則的結果。石達開所以有「吾志未遂人已苦，東南到處有啼痕」之嘆。日本明治維新的成功，英美在遠東覇權之崩潰，又何獨不由於對上述原則之依違呢？</p>
<p>我們懇摯祈望政府隨時戒慎，竭力鞏固政府在人民中所建立的基礎，提高政府在人民中的威信與敬愛，要這樣就必須大量延納民間人材，以健全政治組織，就必須努力培養幹部人才，以强化政治機構；就必須厲行施政考核，以提高政治效率。而爲積極的和澈底的革新政風與修明政治，我們至少應該迅速建立一個類似日本大政翼贊會與翼贊政治會的民意機關，一方面把散漫慣了的民衆組織成國家一大力量；另一方面也可使國家的政綱政策貫澈實現。</p>
<p>從東亞大局說，我們不能繼續由日本獨當艱險，而貪天之功；從對內說，我們不能坐視政府離開人民，致民力游離於國策之外。今日所以講求興衰之道，其第一要義，我們以爲如是而已。願當道三注意之，則國家幸甚！</p>

<h3 id="c2">豫北晋南日軍奏捷　攻佔林縣陵川臨淇　渝軍軍長孫殿英率部投誠　日軍向臨湛西北繼續挺進 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>北京廿四日中央社電　據晋豫冀前綫基地電，日軍自在山西省開始新作戰後，連日向北猛進，並將渝軍「第廿四集團軍」迫至林縣方面。廿三日正午日軍衝入渝軍主要據點臨淇，繼又將其完全佔領。該方面渝軍巳混亂不堪，日軍現正展開大規模之殲滅戰，以期將其全部殲滅。是役渝軍「新編第五軍」軍長孫殿英因不堪日軍猛攻，遂於廿四日下午二時五十分率部投誠，參加和運。又日軍一隊於廿四日自臨洪轉鋒，追擊向李家寨西北方（距臨淇西方八公里）敗退之渝軍激戰約二小時，渝軍被俘一千餘人，遺屍二百具。又日軍另一部隊，曾向臨洪西南方猛攻，廿四日晨渝「新褊第五軍」的兩千人，在北家村及滋陽莊兩地分別投誠，現日軍各部隊正於互相緊密協力下圍殲臨淇西方東月溝一帶渝軍的四萬人。</p>
<p>開封二十四日中央社電　據冀豫日軍前綫某地來電，渝第二十四集團軍新編第五軍軍長孫殿英年來率部轉戰各地，屢遭日軍猛攻，近復鑒於大東亞戰爭　發，渝方抗戰之意義盡失，而自國府參戰後，國家生存之目標，亦益形明顯，唯有在國府　汪主席領導之下，與日本共同協力，始得興復中華，爰特於日前在該軍防次宣佈參加和運。</p>
<p>北京二十四日中央社電　據南部太行山日軍前綫二十三日電；日軍各部隊爲剿滅盤據晋冀豫省境渝軍，乃自晋省東南部開始攻擊，進取陵川，二十一日將劉進所部渝（第二十七）軍之駐地陵川完全佔領；同時並覆滅在橫水鎭之渝軍司令部，繼續前進。又自晋省東南某處進攻之日軍另一部隊，亦圍殲渝軍殘部，二十一日突入省境。此外並自豫省，沿京漢綫展開行動，由臨洪盆地南下之日軍各部隊猛攻渝（第四十）軍主力，旋攻陷林縣，並將渝（第二十四集團）軍司令部所在地之林村曁該地附近之台澗鎭，郎界村等處渝軍重要軍事設施，悉數覆滅，繼續南進。於是三軍分三路進迫，縮小包圍圈，渝軍二十七軍及四十軍在臨淇一帶，已呈漬亂狀態，與渝新編第五軍均陷絕路。又自豫省南方前進之日軍已與突入省境及南進之各日軍部隊獲得聯絡，嚴密進圍。</p>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　據晋冀豫省境日軍前綫來電；日軍爲直衝渝軍第二十四集團軍之據點，乃於二十日夜於京漢綫方面同時開始行動，二十一日即佔領馬店水冶鎭西十四公里附近之渝二十四集團軍所部第四十軍前衛陣地，繼續追擊，二十二日進至水冶鎭西南二十八公里之棋梧村，遂與該村西方憑山頑抗之渝軍千五百名展開激烈之山岳戰，終將渝軍之堡壘陣地奪取，現仍繼續追擊中。又自某方面南進之日軍二十一日傍晚已突入渝第二十四集團軍重要根據地之林縣，豫晋省境水冶鎭西四五公里旋卽完全佔領，繼續進攻，現進抵合澗鎭方面與由某方面北上之日軍相呼應，巳將約三萬之渝第四十軍包圍。又日轟炸戰鬥機編隊二十一日亦呼應地上部隊，以機槍掃射渝第十軍主力及山上之渝軍陣地，予以極大損害。</p>
<p>北京二十四日中央社電　據晋冀豫前綫某地來電，日軍各部隊於晋冀橡三省邊境展開北進作戰後，迄本日爲止，渝軍遺屍六四五具，被俘三一二九人，日軍裁獲步槍三〇六枝，手槍十七枝，自動步槍五枝，重輕機關槍七挺，迫擊砲五門，手溜彈四九枚，及其他各種子彈甚夥</p>
<p>北京二十四日中央社電　國府山西剿共軍爲發揮同生共死之眞精神，現協力日軍在河南臨淇附近痛擊渝方第二十四集團軍。巢共軍於去年七月在山西編成後，即積極訓練，實力日增，此次於第一師長趙隨，第二師長楊誠之指揮下，以二師精銳協力日軍作戰，收獲戰果極大。該軍且始終保持自主作戰，所向無敵。</p>

<p>瑞典京城二十四日中央社電　美國因人力不足，致軍需生產無法大量擴充，現且巳形成嚴重問題，復因陸海軍當局之兵額擴充案及提高產物價問題等之接踵而起，已使羅斯福之戰爭施策，遭受重大影響，此間瑞典日報紐的特派員，曾於二十日撰文述及目前美國人力不足問題之嚴軍狀况，原文稱，美政府深感，在一九四三年年底以前，有獲得七百萬工人之必要，俾以其中三分之二，補充應召人員。人力資源委員會對此並擬動員婦女勞工二百萬人，享受恩給者一百萬人，抵達工作年齡之靑年一百萬人。目前美國國內各方面主張從速實施强制勞働之呼聲甚高，同時並有人主張徵兵年齡减至十七歲之最低限度，俾能獲得人力，蓋因此項問題，已使農村及軍需產業兩方面感受重大影響，尤以農村勞力不足，使美國全國因此發生糧食恐慌。美戰時情報局，亦曾於十五日警吿國民謂，余人必須覺悟在一九四二年中，美國糧食及其他生活必需品，將發生恐慌。實則美國目前，不僅糧食相當缺乏，卽購買馬鈴薯，亦大感困難，加之配給制度之未臻完善，及分配制度之尙未實施，故物價異常昂貴。故一般民衆非難之聲，甚囂塵上。此外美國人民生活指數，亦在日益增高中，美國「經濟雜誌」曾論其近况稱，關於美國糧食配給及生產之不足情形，吾人試觀其目前實施點數制度及配給數量之少，即可了然。藎其中所規定之肉類乳類及油類，等之數量，較諸美人平時生活水準，實至徵少。又實施與數制之十六種物資，每週每人之配給量，較之英國，所多無幾，於此可見美國目前牛乳鷄蛋及家禽類等數量，亦巳不豐富。且因配給制度之不台理，與一般好商利用戰時通貨膨脹而投機囤積之故，而使糧食恐慌問題，益形嚴重。惟農村派議員，復利用此種情勢，企圖提高農產物價格，而不斷提出要求，甚至與政府發生正面衝突，釀成政治問題，此卽美議員潘克辦特於其提案中，主張規定農產物平衡價格時，應將政府之補助金除去，此案雖於四月二日爲羅斯福所拒絕，但農村派議員之見解，仍認爲提高農產物價格，足以刺激農民，藉以解決糧食恐慌問題。故前當議會表決（潘克赫特案）時，彼等曾謂，日前若不予農民以深刺激，則美國糧食問題，必將陷於極度恐慌之境，其結果或將使戰爭因而失敗。美國糧食缺乏之另一主要原因，即美國根據租軍法，必須以國內糧食產額之百分之二十五，運往國外也。</p>

<p>（仰光十四日特電）　敵人奪回緬甸的企圖，因着日本駐緬軍的力鬥，今已完金成爲白畫的幻夢而消逝了。然而敵人的企圖奪回阿恰布，確是名符其實之拚命的出擊戰。所以在那地勢的異常和氣候的酷熱——簡直像燒灼大地般的炎熱之下，克服野象出沒完全「原始境」的一切惡條件而擊退敵人，該地日軍將士的勞苦，比之在西南太平洋戰綫上奢，實有過之而無不及。展開於馬酋半島的包圍殲滅戰，是此次戰鬥的終局，本報特派員三島，爲追及部隊參加此戰，特渡過馬酋河，從猶阿契特附近，越過馬酋山脈峻嶮，四日之間，備嘗艱苦，浴敵人槍砲子彈的洗禮，避敵機的威脅於洞穴，一日一食，卒抵目的地。在馬酋半烏布置着包圍鐵鏈之日軍前綫部隊，伐開叢林，沿着海岸地帶，隨處擊破頑敵，此刻正在驅敵人於北部納夫河岸國境之外。該處日軍，現正日日忍受着給養缺乏，熱汗，不眠，艱苦等而戰鬥着。而且這裏最值得注意的，乃是日軍將士的這種勞苦，自去年底敵人蘭開夏聯隊企圖進擊以來，現在尙還完全繼續着。我們應該想想那許多在人跡不到的叢林蠻野，灼熱如火的沼澤地帶，現在尙還繼續着凄烈決戰之日軍勇士的勞苦吧！以下爲三島君的隨軍歷險記。</p>
<p>（南部印緬國境馬酋最前綫三島特派員十四日發）　西南太平洋戰綫的特色，如果說是以無數的島嶼和掩蔽它們的密林地帶爲舞台，在敵機執拗之下，冒着一切的補給困難而遂行着的話，則在同樣條件之下的馬酋河戰綫，正在說是陸上的西南太平洋戰綫。以馬酋河爲中心而跨着阿恰布，拉契同，蒙德烏三地的作戰地區，　問縱橫交錯着無數的河浜，作戰槪須靠着舟艇之助方能進行。從一島向他島的攻擊，也完全如此。並且這裏的河浜，和中國戰綫的河浜不同，大都有着三百公尺以上的河幅，敵人的砲艇，常出沒於其閒，使日軍後方的輸送，發生許多困難。現在作戰已移至馬酋山脈地區，在時常聽見野象嘯聲的峻嶮山　上，用着臂力來搬運火砲及糧秣等，這樣地繼續着困難的戰鬥。記者以隨軍於該戰綫的機會，得完全體騐到將士的勞苦，以下即爲此次的隨軍記錄。</p>
<p>三月三十一日</p>
<p>昨夜九時，發自阿恰布的我們舟艇，在縱橫交錯的河浜地帶，靠着星光，由船舶工兵引路前進。是夜繁星滿天，地上螢火隱現，相映成趣。夜半二點鐘過後，駛抵淺灘，不能再前進了。這時正值月出前的大落潮，在排山倒海般的潮水未來之前，暫時椗泊等待着，約等待一個鐘頭光景。其間曾聽到前方傳來連續四發的砲聲，還有機關槍聲音，原來前方正在激烈地戰鬭着。不久抵達第一目的地，更前進預定渡過馬酋河，進抵馬酋山脈附近，可是在渡河點附近的途中，發見島後有隱伏着的敵方砲艇。據說剛纔渡河歸來的我軍，受到曳　彈的投射，立　以搭載着的對戰車砲應戰，竟有一隻舟艇的重油槽，被曳光彈打中而起火了。此外，艇員也有幾人被害。我們在暫時椗泊之間所聽到的槍砲聲，便是那時發生的。一時喪失了許多部下的船舶工兵小隊長寺井，聲音已表現得很爲悲壯。業巳渡河的部隊本部，想要用電話速絡可是因爲途中隔着一條河，電話不能聽淸楚，要差通信兵通知，又很危險，所以令夜似乎打算着中止前進。然而大家急於要渡河，山砲也帶　，而且認爲到了明晚，狀况說不定還是一樣，於是便把山砲裝在舟艇上，以便發射，用以掩護舟艇，終於決定强行渡河了。馬酋河的河幅約有二千公尺，須經十分鐘才能渡過，如果在這十分鐘間不被發覺而抵達對岸的河浜內，就沒有危險。一會兒終於在馬酋河中了。忽然先行的舟艇把對戰車砲開了三砲，知道已被發覺，然而敵人的機槍聲音却沒有聽見。我們這邊的山砲也發射了二發　重機關槍也放射起來。終於在不自然的沉默之中進入了對岸的河浜內。在中洲附近發見了敵人的砲艇，我方制着機先，立即對之射擊。最後抵達上陸地點時，東方已略發白。從這裏到目的地的部隊本部，約有二公里之距。如果天大亮時，一定有敵機來襲。途中二次碰到敵人矗炸機掠頭飛過，可是並未發生什麼事情，終得安然到達了部隊本部。這幾天速日有敵機不絕來襲，而且飛得很低，我方常用槍來射擊。據說剛纔正有一個兵士走着的時候被發見，那個兵土一直到受傷倒地，用槍射敵機。所以部隊本部就在乾涸的河道兩岸掘成橫穴潛避於中。我們一到本部，同時敵人的旋風式戰鬬機也趕來了，飛在頭上的一百公尺高，英國空軍的徽　，可以看見得淸淸楚楚，約有一個鐘頭翱翔着不去。</p>
<p>四月一日</p>
<p>這裏一天總有五，六次以上，有敵機來，所以在日閒炊飯做食等事，想也不會想到，一切都在夜閒準備，一天只有早晚二餐。一到黃昏時候，記者爲要去追及第一綫〇〇部隊，得本部三宅少尉的介紹，便和衛兵二名一同出發。路漸漸進入爲酋山脈之中去了，一路連　着使人驚駭的山坡，而且是密林地帶，我們就穿越着除犬以外不能通行的隙道而前進，雖然滿天星斗，可是在密林之中，幾乎連鼻子都摸不着，脚邊的危險，自然不待說得了。在這樣困難的狀况之中，兵士們徹夜默默地輸送着糧秣和彈藥。因爲後方輸送困難之故，除了戰鬥上極屬必要的人員外，都沒有渡河，因此糧秣彈藥等的輸送，也槪由第一綫的兵士自己來擔任。在最前綫，先前帶去的糊秣快要吿盡，再照這樣下去，就不能不待飛機投下糧秣以爲接濟了。可是彈藥和糧秣，是最重要的，雖死也非輸送不可的。輸送着的兵士自身，差不多已沒有正常的膳食，空着肚皮，搖　着脚，擔着笨重的彈藥和糧秣而輸送着。兵士們的苦勞，眞是不能用言語來形容的。</p>

<p>里斯本二十四日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，英軍突尼西亞橋頭堡之西段，企圖將軸心軍逐出星期三日反攻中所佔領之地區，結果毫無効果，蒙高茂萊將軍所率之英第八軍，乃於星期四日一再撲攻南段軸心軍之山岳陣地，但因德義軍之堅强抵抗，仍難突破，英軍因三日來屢圖衝破軸心軍之東南側翼，皆無功効，現巳採取消耗戰術，以困對方。星期四日英第八軍之砲隊，在軸心軍摩托化砲兵準確射擊及德義空軍猛　之下，不惜彈藥，以期打破軸心軍之堅固防禦工事，其步兵亦在砲火掩獲下，衝鋒前進，但均在近距離中被軸心軍猛烈砲火所遏阻。英國與新西蘭部隊，會在多處地方與德義軍發生肉搏戰，唯結果仍不能佔得立足點。所有山中隙地，仍在軸心軍之手。前綫之西段，軸心軍在梅特傑埃爾巴勃與包阿達拉兩地閒之攻勢，頗爲成功。使英軍感覺陣地危險，不得不以絕大代價，奪回所失之地區，英步兵於其砲隊猛轟之後，由法軍相輔，同時在數處進攻，軸心軍陣地前之地雷區域，予進攻者以極大打擊，英軍見勢不佳，企圖繞越地雷區域，不料又陷入軸心軍之火網，傷亡愈增。此舉大出英軍意料之外，突破軸心陣地之計劃，至此又吿失敗。反軸心軍在阿特拉斯山區之全部戰塲中，雖對於人力物力犧牲甚鉅，結果亦完全失敗。彼等已不得不承認軸心軍陣地之優越，蓋德義軍得依據地形而佈置防務也。昨日艾森霍華將軍總司令部之公報中，謂英第八軍因軸心軍於星期四日進攻其　地，損失甚爲重大云。又據反軸心方而之消息，英第一軍於星期五日上午二時許，以步兵三路在包阿拉達區開始進攻，據安德梅將軍司令部之報吿，逢杜法斯地方，已由西北方面感受威脅，法叛軍正在該城之甫面，作猛烈之防守戰。英第八軍自稱於海戰後已攻佔恩費特維爾西北數哩之太克羅那地方，現正續向西北進展，以柴格霍恩爲目的地。據稱羅美爾元帥在該地建有最偉大之防禦工事，聞蒙高茂美將軍己調印軍第四師團爲先鋒部隊，俾克參加不久即將暴發之激戰，同時德義空軍繼續協助陸軍作戰，星期四日德轟炸機會空襲英軍坦克車及摩托運輸部隊，德義戰鬥機星期四日共擊落英美飛機十六架，內有七架係四引擎轟炸機。</p>

<h3 id="c33">公布美機慘敗後　美輿論界不滿 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>阿根廷京城廿四日中央社電　美國自珍珠灣慘敗後，其戰時情報局及陸海軍兩省所發表之戰况，實全屬揑造，匪　不爲全世界人士的置信，即在團內亦遭國民紛紛抨擊。此次美屬宣傳轟炸東京一事，美戰時情報局又軍再造失敗，又引起言論界之不滿，蓋自戰時情報局總裁台維斯，說明定美機矗炸東京周年紀念日發表眞相後，美陸軍部因已於一九四二年五月發表揑造公報，深恐眞相發表後，露出破綻，乃向白宮表示反對，惟在日陸軍報道部長發表美機襲日之詳情後美戰時情報局巳難抑壓國內輿論，故不得不於廿一目公布美機空襲東京情形。但此次發表者與陸軍部前次之發表完全不同，致美國與論界一致曄然不滿。如紐約泰語士報謂，美國國民美國新聞界均不欲聞揑造之消息，蓋此實有傷美軍名譽，但不幸陸軍部並未採取此項政策，而此次發表之美機轟炸東京情形，其令人誤解之處頗多，實費屬解。猶憶去年五月羅總統以勛章授杜里特時，美軍司令部曾謂美機空襲東京，並無一架被擊落，或因傷未返防地云。然此次發表即又謂美機並無一架安返防地，僅有在西伯利亞被扣之一架未　損害。如此前後矛盾，深爲可笑云云。又弗吉尼亞洲林赤堡報，亦抨擊當同，謂陸軍部于發表重要消息後，引起民間不滿，實難避免，但美國國民于美機轟炸東京情形發表後，已知過去之屢被當局所欺，時至今日，美人對於美機空襲東京一事，固難忘壞，同時對於被當所欺，亦必時深銘腦海云，</p>

<h3 id="c35">確立戰爭和生產一致態勢　（二）　努力增產把握戰爭主動權 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>這方法各國都在研究改良，在敵方，英國首先應用，美國去年亦獲得這專利權而開始製造。至於我國，最近已經造成了比英美更進步的東西，配置於各要點。這方法對飛機及潛水艦戰確有很大的影響。</p>
<p>這種作戰資材的進步改良，一步一步的先　或後於敵人，在作戰的　移上當然有很大的影饗，並也可以左右戰勢。故而科學技術在兵器·衣·糧·衛生各分野上，不能不有日新月異的進步。尤其在今日，作戰的狀態已有極大的變遷，　了戰爭生產一致態勢的確立，　爲了把握戰爭的主動權起　　下列各項、尤須格外留意</p>
<p>（一）飛機　飛機的發　，在　速度並航續距離上，在武裝及裝甲上的進步，有待於其他各種兵器資材的進步並進，將來是眞正主要的決戰兵器。飛機發達的究極問題，又當別論，在目前，一步步走在敵前，比敵人優越，是格外重要的。</p>
<p>（二）對飛行兵器　因飛機的發達，高射兵器，防空資材的發達當然也跟着重要起來。如現在用飛機對付飛機爲第一義之外，在地面上水平綫地行動的，以目標的射擊爲目的，而發遠起來的火　類，加以立體的改革之故，卽完全信賴他的能力，這尙不免是不足够的。</p>
<p>據傳某國最近已經　成了用電波可以制止飛行於一千或二千公尺內的飛機之發動機。事實的眞僞雖不可知，但用電波及別種方法把成羣飛行於天空中的飛機一網打盡而使之墜落，這一夢想必將於短期間見之現實。</p>
<p>（三）船舶　無論船舶所受到的振害如何，必須建造大量新船以補充在戰事中的損耗，忍受敵所進行的交通破壞戰，且進而戰勝敵的交通破壞戰，是結束此次戰爭的有力手段之一。關於船舶，除了當要急速且大量的生產技術之外，要在敵的制空權下及潛水艦所窺伺的海面上，完成運輸給養於第一綫軍隊的任務，幷要擔任在距離甚遠的原料地與生產地之間運輸生產的任務，像現有的船舶不能勝任，尙必項加以特別的研究。</p>
<p>上述飛躍的增進生產以擴充戰力，業已有鞏固的大東亞共榮圈爲其立脚點，並因作戰資材的改良進步，常把握戰局的主動權，隨時　地擊破敵的反　，且進而打取攻勢，這在首相的施政演說中業已闡述無遺。至於「爲了摧毀英美的戰爭意志」，應該怎樣做　，這是我今天所講的主旨所在。一切戰爭，它的結束，此其開始，比其繼續，最爲重要。怎樣結束戰爭，是擔任戰爭指導的人們，甚至於全體人民，所念念不忘的。但結束戰爭不是作戰所能獨自爲力的，必須有賴於外交政略各方面的同時並進。一旦戰爭開始，它的結束斷不是昕夕可期的。</p>
<p>我們不能忘掉用眞正的武力迫敵作城下之盟，這種實力手段是結束戰爭的唯一大道。如其立於生產戰綫的我們，或在口頭上，或在思想上，懷着和平論的意見，而不確立整個的計劃，這等於用槍砲攻擊戰十的背後。</p>
<p>美國有好戰的且頑强的國民。在這以大陸和太平洋爲競技塲的戰爭中，即便我們充分發揮了科學技術的優秀性，最後如不在美國本土上有所打擊，很難摧毀他們的戰爭意志。要在英美本土加以打擊，唯一的困難是太平洋幅員的距離問題。但這距離問題目前在飛機之偉大的進步面前，早已不成問題了。我國在技術上已經解決這問題，德義也止在整頓空襲美國本土的準備，日德義東西呼應，空襲美國本土的日子，必不在遠。</p>
<p>美國現正盛傳將空襲日本，他們以爲日本的木造建築經不起空襲，所以想用空襲可以打敗日本。日本木造建築的一間間小屋，對空襲的損害極小，且重建極爲容易。像美國擁居多數家族的公寓，和美國人得意的摩天樓，對空襲的損害才大　。尤以美國的高層建築物，因爲沒有對震性的顧慮，所以對於某種炸彈之集中的使用，極爲危險。</p>
<p>我所說的打擊美國本土，並不是報復性與英美互相交換慢性的，免疫性的，不徹底的空襲，我們必須有充分的研究與準備，蓋一旦開始航空作戰，如欲一舉摧毀敵國的戰意，斷非一朝一夕所能奏效。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭開始以來，在政略戰略之巧妙且密切的協調下，在極困難的序戰中，成就了奇襲與强襲的偉續。終於攻取了戰略據點與重要資源地域。今後的戰爭指導，以這偉大的序戰之成果作基礎，發揮科學技術的全能，以增强生產，改良作戰資材，常把握戰勢的主動權，隨時隨地擊破敵的反抗，繼續攻勢，最後對美國本土加以大打擊，這偉大的工作之責任，大半負於科學技術的分野。我們熱烈希望擔任科學技術分野的人們，應該有上述的自覺，與第一綫的將士們日與彈藥作伴同樣，或在研究室，或在工塲，或竟到第一綫，用死而後已的決心，負起這偉大的責任。（翔：譯自四月十五日東京朝日新聞）</p>
<h3 id="c36">科學戰的必勝態勢 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>日軍的善謀勇戰，爲世界無匹，這是無人懷疑的；日本國民的戰意和團結力，也是如此。在這種精神的方面，日本的戰力優於英美，無論是敵是友，都已老早承認。又多年來被視爲日本戰力上最大弱點之物的持久力，也由於在大東亞戰爭中獲得了有利的政治經濟的地步和莫大的資源，作爲其戰果，已可不必有所掛慮了。不過成爲問題的，乃是如何能把新銳的科學兵器，如何能多量而月迅速地，送至戰綫，即關於技術的生產一事而巳。英美所抱對日的戰意，要不外基於此　而充滿其自負心。同時，國內有識人士所竊竊　念者，也無非在於此點。幸而關於生產力之量的增强策。經前次議會審議後，已上了軌道，而由十四日佐藤軍務局長在「陸軍技術有功紀念章授與表彰典禮」中所作的演說，我們乃知道日本科學技術之質的水準，正凌駕乎敵人之上。故國民在總力戰各方面，已可一掃其杞憂，而堅其必勝的信念。</p>
<p>佐藤少將那次的大演說，切實表可了雄大的戰爭規模和軍當局之果敢的決意，其中關於兵器和軍需品的改良，說着許多很有把握的實例。例如：「利用超短波以預知敵人的潛艇或飛機襲來之警戒器，」現在已發達到可和高射砲相連，以射擊看不見的飛機，英美軍曾屢屢以此惹惱日本空軍將士，然而「日本最近巳完成了遠比英美爲進步的器械，」陸續配置於各要點。「空襲有什麼可怕呢？」這是日本防空陣的覺悟，這譽悟是因爲有了一個科學的基礎而生的。此外，特殊食糧，瘧疾特效藥，瘧疾免疫預防法，戰塲整形術等等的成功，無不在科學戰中，成爲日本的勝利。由此種在防空，兵食，衛生等方面之長足的進步而類推，則日本科學在積極的攻擊兵器方面之優越性，不待想像可知。佐藤少將所說空襲美國本土的可能性，正是它的證明。</p>
<p>太平洋橫越的畏距離，在飛機的進步之前，也早已不成問題了。美國方面作爲其挽回敗戰之策的，似企圖欲由長距離轟炸機，空襲日本本土。此則非覺悟其必來不可。然而戰爭是相互的。「日本對於這個問題，巳於技術上解決了」，和穗意兩盟邦相呼應，「空襲美國本土之日，必已不遠」，這是佐藤少將所說的。沒有耐震性的美國高層建築，對於」某種炸彈之集中的使用」極爲危險。澈底的「以一切强力的他種手段，加入航空作戰」，日軍正在考慮着一舉而把敵人摧毀的戰略。那不單是希望而已。實現這件事之科學的技術力，賦與日本國民的，遠在敵人以上，這只要徵諸軍務局長所說的一二例，和那天所表彰的諸研究，巳思過半了。珍珠港的空襲，於他們確是名符實的靑天霹靂，同樣，美本土也一定會遭遇這個靑天霹靂的吧。爲使那個日子早些到來，我們必須舉國努力，因爲英美乃是我們的强敵。我們必須不爲「抄近路的和平論」所迷，唯由使用武力之正攻法，打他一個罷休。</p>
<p>現在的戰爭，正如東條首相所說，是「天天科學和科學，技術和技術的角逐」。行着這科學戰的日本之科學技術，在其質上，已具有對英美必勝的自信了。然而他們所恃的，乃是其大量生產力。日本的科學技術力，在兵器生產的量和速度上，自然也非證明在他們之上不可。我們切望科學技術者的奮起，常常想出比敵人進一步的科學創案：同時切望國民協力，把這科學的創案，移諸實際的生產，大量地急速地實現爲戰力。要增强戰力，全國民必須大爲奮發之理由，即在於此，我們的最後勝利是無疑的，不過我們必須由努力和忍耐，使己急速而且確質才可。（丁：譯自四月十六日朝日新聞社論）</p>
<h3 id="c37">科學戰爭勝利的方法 <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>科學技術在現代總力戰上的地位極爲重要。在決戰的現階段，科學技術的戰爭之日見激化，無待贅言。發揮科學技術的優秀性，不僅使戰局有利地進展而巳，最基本的任務，使對方喪失戰意，而造成勝利的原因。如此，國家對科畢技術者的任務發出了無限的要求，與决戰的至上命令，要求日本科學技術之急速目飛躍的進步。十四日的　軍技術研究會上，對科學戰綫有貢獻的優秀科學技術者，授與陸軍技術有功章，道種國家的表彰，確有重大的意義。</p>
<p>戰爭是文化之父，創造之母。此次戰爭中，軍器，作戰資村有日新月異的改良進步。就以此　的表彰來看，如軍隊因戰事體系而機動化，對戰車　器的發達，飛機技術，機上無綫電話，小型空冷發動機，高質燃料，燃料噴射裝置，航空用酸素發生劑，超短波警戒機，算定　：對航空兵器，光學兵器等的進步，通信兵器的準備，特殊衣糧，軍事衛生醫學，獸醫學的躍進，格納庫，戰用兵舍建設，滅蚊綫香的改善等，如實地表示了日本軍事科學技術水準的高昂。</p>
<p>日本重工業部門的發展，本來絞爲後進，故生產科學頗爲遲緩，最近始見躍進。</p>
<p>今後爲了獲致終局的勝利，應盡量發揮業已攻取確保的戰略據點，重要資源地帶的價値，活用大東亞共榮圈的資源，以增强生產力。目前的急務，首在於確立　機，船舶，鋁，鐵，煤等重要產業的必勝態勢，故不僅要求個人在生產能率上的努力，並迫切要請生產科學技術力面的創造與研究。</p>
<p>爲促進這軍事，生產科學技術的躍進，除根本上的自然科學之基礎的研究外，更須有精神科學技術的協力及立足於科學的政治。換句話說，在科學的政治上，推進科學技術政策，實爲當務之急。</p>
<p>其對第之一，便是整備，强化科學動員體制。例如統一，改組各公私科學研究機關，設置科學研究所等。</p>
<p>其二，謀科學技術與產業的聯繫，融合，除去經營管理上的矛盾，使科學技術得在生產增强上盡具最大的機能。希望各統制會中的技術部有積極的活動。</p>
<p>其三，獎勵發明發見，助長其工業化設置科學技術振興機關，工業試騐機關，普及並提高科學思想和科學智識。從速實現科學技術的新體制。</p>
<p>最後，確立對勤勞發明者的報償制。對科學技術者予以精神上的優遇，此次的技術有功章，興勤勞顯功章，可統一而設定一種動章制度，在信賞必罰的原則下，改善國家的表彰制度之運用。（翔：譯自三月十六日東京讀賣報知社評。）</p>

<p>佛說：「我不入地獄，誰入地獄」。欲謀社會人羣之福利，當先解救衆生之地獄生活，福利之反面爲禍害，必使大衆無禍無寄，始可保少數人之安富尊榮。又云：「衆生不成佛，我不成佛」。大衆多貧病顚連，少數人之富貴，亦無幸福可言。所以爲社會服務，是人人應盡之義，當此非常時期，福利事業，頭緒紛繁。茲大別之如次：</p>
<p>（甲）安三失　失學，失業，失戀，三者爲社會不安之原，如靑年失學，易入邪途，或不能成材而圖建樹，申報社提倡助學金，意至善也。失業則爲游浪而不生產，且形響治安，希望資本家多開工廠，收容游民，政府設法救濟，使人盡其才，物盡其用，方可謀眞正之平和也。失戀是精神上最大痛苦，希望賢明師長及宗教家循循　導，能使愛情昇華，更可振作文化事業，例如哥德因失戀而完成大著作，尤可效法。</p>
<p>（乙）救三苦　老，病，死，三者爲人世之大苦。如養老院，醫院及療養院，施材會掩埋隊及火葬塲，已爲社會慈善機關所努力辦理。近有信佛居士及醫　們擬發起佛友療養院，可以養老，可以養病，並設佛堂，可以虔修，即臨終之時，喜聞佛號，心不顚倒，必往生極樂，冀普度三苦，其宗旨仰佛慈悲，即非佛教中病人，不拘何教，亦引爲友，隨緣療養，身心兼治，此事願宏，希望海內大德鼎力贊助。</p>
<p>（丙）求三多　冬福多壽多男子，爲古今人所祝禱，福是氣量宏大　意義，要享福，必須經練修養功夫，希望家政學者及碩學宏儒多辦修福講座，敎導大衆有禮貌，有氣度，有享福的資格。壽是康健長壽的實義，凡德高望重之尊長祝壽時，應請衛生家講演長應法，請主婦講述康健生活，並用素食，以不殺生而推廣善行爲準則。多男子更爲世界所圾需要，民族主義之基礎也。倘患伯道無兒，應視他兒如己子，或捐助家財，贊助孤兒院及難童教養院，「多難興邦」，尤望「多男與邦」也。近世男女平等，婦女尤爲家庭之主幹，欲治其國，必先齊其家，家中主婦，有教育兒女，調度財富之賣，即三多亦須由婦女爲出發點。所以欲「保富」，應先「保婦」，「婦賢」是「富緣」也。提倡婦女修養，亦屬人羣福利之事業。</p>
<p>總之：自求多「福」，防患未然；以義爲「利」，保富可久。今者恭聆張一鵬先生所示金玉良言，不勝感服。希望大衆自省自肅，勉策將來，謹貢芻見，還祈海內賢達多多教正爲幸。（完）</p>

<p>日本在大東亞戰爭中，陸海軍所以取得大戰果的原因，不僅是將士英勇盡忠報國所致，目也不能不歸功於供給戰塲的飛機，坦克車，槍砲，各種優秀科學兵器，以及糧秣，藥品，建設器材等等。陸軍方面，對於　類勝利兵器的發明家曾頒發過第二次陸軍技術有功獎章，茲把到得獎章者，以及主要發明家介紹於次：（濤：譯自四月十七日東京每日新聞）</p>
<p>小型强大馬力發動機…小谷武夫，加藤健次兩技師。協力者（住友）…</p>
<p>完成最新新小型强大馬力發動機，而　定我國戰鬥空軍的勝利基礎者，即中島飛行機東京製作所設計課長小谷武夫氏（三八歲）及該製作所實騐員加藤健次技師，與其他協力者。但在這一偉大發明本身，曾耗費過莫大的苦心。近代戰爭的主要部份乃空戰，以是各國都日新月異地追求航空機的發展與進步。在戰爭期閒內，今天的武器決不得當作明天的武器來用。所以開始從事一種新的設計，一直　到完成爲止，其中間所消耗的時間只有飛機更要求極大縮短。即是說，要求新式飛機出　最爲迫切。小谷技　新近設計的小型强大馬力發動機，僅僅在〇個月內就完成這一設計，可以說在製作史上以察前的短期間內而大功吿成。其馬力之强大，對於世界列强來說，只有勝之而無不及。特別提高了氣筒周圍主要運動部份，曲軸窩，製動器，起伏器，氣化器等性能，且在駕駛上更使　簡單化。其性能若比起最近世界列强所製作的，在出力面積與重量方面上，的確是非常優秀的。</p>
<p>在我國航空技術陣營內，供獻空軍幾許精銳機的小谷技師，爲了戰勝敵國英美，和非以科學取勝不可的加藤技師，共同開始强大馬力發勳機之新設計，對於向來氣冷式發動機比水冷式發動機的前面稍大，而不適於小型高速度飛機之要求，於是後　榨汁，不斷研究的結果，竟在消極方面，完了前而積之縮小工作，在積極方面極度增，了單位容積的「出力」情形，就是如此宣佈劃時代的小型强大馬力發動機大功吿成。近來　了製造這種飛機，上至軍部，下至民間，都在自我犧牲地協助促其實現，甚至住友等資材公司也與以極大的援手，由是軍民中之具有才能者都集中起來了。在工塲中建立起來製作綜合體制，使設計，工作，研究，實騐等各部內有機的配合起來，在拚命地繼續生產。協力公司竟打破資材的缺乏，而源源不絕地提供必要原料，員工都以廢寢忘食的精神不斷地操作着。於是新銳小型强大馬力發動機，由於小谷技師的伏秀設計，加藤技師的洽當實騐，以後該製作所綜合制的生產，而第一批生產就很迅速地交貨了。負責實騐的加藤技師抱病完成此項工作，某一職工父死而不發訃文，不使外人知道，一直作工到大功吿成，這種熱心眞是驚天地泣鬼神的美談。</p>
<p>小谷技師說：「無論如何好的設計，而沒有好的協力者幫助合作，則決不可能在短時期內收到效果。特別是時間寶貴的今日，能在這樣短的時間內完成，這完全要歸功於協力者，同時，一切的光榮與名　，也可以說是關係者全體爭取到的。」</p>

<p>趁囤積問題之機會，中日各方均盼中國金融機關應即自肅，陳財次於二十二日之談話中，亦提及此點，披瀝國府對此事之決心，預料周財長返京後，即將召開金融統制之關係首腦部會議。據聞此項會議。將提出銀行錢莊整理合併問題之提案，提出此項整理合併問題之理由，皆因金融業者將其資本用於囤積或投機方面，或則貸與以囤積爲目的之商界。觀察最近銀行界之業務內容，銀行公會員銀行收受之存款額，約十九億元，其中浙江興業·大陸·鹽業·金城·中國·交通·中南·中國懇業等十一家銀行之收受存款額，約占七億至八億元，錢業公會會員錢莊收入存軟總額，約六億至六億五千萬元，銀錢兩業合計約二十五億元，銀行力面之放款，約十五·六億元，錢莊放款約五億至五億五千萬元。就其詳細觀之，定期存款，占存款總額百分之二〇，活期存款占百分之八〇，在事變前，定期存款占百分之六〇强，活期存款僅百分之四〇弱，先後比較，可見現在之業務不健全，如任其不加整頓，則確立戰時經濟體制，必爲阻碍，通貨，物資，物價經齊各項施策，勢遭重大困難，由於比種不建全之組織，囤積事件亦從而發生。</p>
<p>日本爲使資本集中於培養戰力之一點起見，故實施國家金融統制，而上海之金融界適得其反，毫無統制，宛似一艦散沙，資本僅在追求利潤上盤　，國府實不容一刻猶豫亟應確立戰時經濟體制。第一步先應將大小一百五十餘家之銀行及一千家以之錢荘，信託公司，地產公司等加以整理合作，務使各行莊公司一律遵守金融機關取締辦法。例如資金爲一百萬元之金融企業，不准其動用數百萬巨款而購買物資，或以此爲担保而獲得資金，更不容有購買物資等之投機　爲，同時不准有放款供人囤積投機之銀行存在，姑舉其具體辦法數點以供參考：</p>
<p>（一）對於有害　益之各小余融機關，實行整理合併。</p>
<p>（二）設定對於存款之法定支付準備金。</p>
<p>（三）抑制不良放款。</p>
<p>（四）實施銀行監查辦法等。</p>
<p>同時從速準備商統會之下層機構，促進物資交流，開設交易所，吸收現物登塲，使游資集中於此，而刺激生產，於是流動於投機方面之民族資本，可誘導至開發產業，增加生產等國家目的之方向上。（雲鵬：譯自四月二十四日大陸新報）</p>

<p>在中日兩棉製品聯合會外，爲決定各項成案起見，並將組織中日協議會，協商今後各項措置。此外，並附有棉花統制會之組織，等商蒐買棉花等事宜。</p>
<p>紡織廠改他種生產</p>
<p>又悉，本市紡織廠，因最近棉花大感缺乏，致日商紡織廠開工者巳由百分之二十减至百分之一·七，而華商紡織廠業已大都停工，開工者　較日商爲减少，僅有百分之一·五·以致各華商紡織廠有繼日商紡織廠之後，將廠中設備調整，改成其他工業生產</p>

<p>（　）迅速成立配給機構：若能做到上述的淸查辦法以後，其善後的辦法，便是將一切重要物資收爲國有，和迅速地成立配給機構，這方是治本的方法。若能將低價的生活日用品配給民衆，那麼入民對於生活的恐慌心理，也就無形消滅。所謂「黑市塲」亦不滅而自滅。這種機構的組成，在戰時是刻不容緩的。參考日本和滿洲的配給制度，大都以戶爲單位，而成爲町區的劃分，採用配船票制，指定特殊商店辦理。其法優固多點，不過用在我國，恐怕又要弊端百出。卽以目前配給糖油兩項而言，不但受委託的商店要作弊，即保甲長從中自肥者，恐亦大不乏人。最好由政府成立日用物資總管理局，就上海市而言，分爲若干區，每一區成立適當數的分配所，直接以票制配給民衆，不經商人的手，自可少却一層剝削。這樣一來，生產者與消費者，得因政府機關的介紹而直接携手，於廠方和消費者雙方都有裨益。就是在全面和平以後，這個免去中間階級的方法，只要民衆習慣了以後，亦不會感覺到不便的地方。</p>
<p>（三）工廠出品由政府收買：配給的物品從什麼地方來呢？其一，便是充公的囤貨。若能照第一項辦法澈底實行，各種日用品的數量，必不在少。其二，便是工廠的出品，不許私自買賣，只由政府以適當的利潤，付與代價而全部收買。如此，旣可以根絕以廠單爲買賣的投機，更可調整適常物價，不過，道種辦法的流弊亦可產生，就是廠方依然可以私自出售，成爲黑市價格。那麼一種監察制度是需要的。政府可以責成公會負責監督，或派人督察，若有私自出售情事，經理人和公會負責人應予嚴厲的處分。</p>

<h3 id="e1">On the Way to National Prosperity and Decline <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Those who hold national power must be concerned with the way to national prosperity and decline. Therefore, great statesmen should always be cautious and far-sighted, not content with small achievements, nor neglectful of minor issues. Above all, it is important to remember what Mencius said: "Heaven sees as my people see; Heaven hears as my people hear." They should fear being alienated from the people, lest they lead the country to a dead end of danger and ruin. We do not want to create alarm or simply offer empty rhetoric. However, given the current political situation, we must offer a word of earnest advice to the authorities.</p>
<p>Looking at the overall situation, it is indeed a historically rare opportunity for our country to turn itself around. Especially with the stabilization of the East Asian war situation and the implementation of a new policy towards China by our friendly nation, Japan, enabling us to break free from the shackles imposed by Britain and the United States for the past century. The government authorities have not boasted about their achievements. We believe that as long as they are Chinese, no one will fail to increase their trust in the government because of this. This refers to the favorable international political situation. Secondly, looking at domestic affairs, the gradual establishment of a wartime system and the gradual strengthening of the central government are sufficient to predict a promising future for the nation.</p>
<p>However, can we be complacent with the aforementioned new international and domestic situation? We believe that wise government authorities will never think this way. On the contrary, from the perspective of foreign affairs, with the progress of the world war and the evolution of the international situation, the responsibility that our country, after joining the war, should bear for the Greater East Asia Axis powers can truly be described as "a heavy burden and a long road." How much have we prepared and implemented? To be honest, the task of defending the Pacific is still only supported by Japan alone. Furthermore, from the perspective of domestic affairs, Chongqing remains a stronghold in the southwest, and the Communists are rampant in the northwest; the central plains are a land of famine, and the disaster victims suffer the pain of collective death; the southeast is awaiting reconstruction in all aspects, and there is a lack of both financial resources and talent. The so-called completion of China's construction and stabilization of the rear in East Asia are still only in the initial stages, requiring government leaders to lead the way and set an example for the people. Can the current political institutions, political programs, policies, and talents be competent and happy in their roles? Who can provide an absolutely affirmative answer?</p>
<p>Whether domestically or internationally, to fully answer the above questions and seek the "art of survival" rather than the "way to certain ruin," the main thing is to need a strong central government, a central government with full centripetal force. Specifically, it is to strengthen the National Government, so that it can more truly and fully assume and complete the mission of the new era. However, based on the current facts, today's National Government is not a government directly responsible to the voters or to the parliament. The implementation of its organizational system and national policies is not from the bottom up, but from the top down. Today, we do not discuss whether this kind of government structure is good or bad, but we must solemnly point out that due to the characteristics of this political system and organization, if we want to strengthen it and maximize its effectiveness, then we must first require every member of the government organization, from the highest leader to the lower-level cadres, to be a model for the people of the whole country, to establish a clean and upright political atmosphere, and at the same time to strive for the soundness of all government institutions, the sensitivity of the entire system from top to bottom, and the close collaboration between all levels of institutions and parallel institutions, so that the government is like a flexible machine, like a healthy human body, not only can the highest authorities formulate the most appropriate national policies based on concrete objective reality and subjective conditions, but also all levels can thoroughly understand and quickly and effectively promote and implement them. We hope that the government will show, not only in form and law, but also from the actual organization, in the actions of every government member, that the government is indeed a strong government, capable of undertaking all the domestic and foreign tasks entrusted to it by the new era, and that it can actually live up to the expectations of the people. Then, although the National Government has not yet been produced through the form of popular election, the closeness of the connection within the government and between the government and the people can be worthy of the governments of contemporary strong countries such as Japan and Germany, and fully represent the interests of all the people of the Republic of China. The government is completely established on the basis of the firm support of all the people. At that time, the government and the people will have a close connection of flesh and blood, sharing weal and woe. The "court" will have the heart of "regarding the people's drowning as one's own drowning," and the "opposition" will have the determination of "national humiliation and the people's death." Then, it will be possible to achieve true "total mobilization" from spirit to matter, and complete the mission of joining the war and building the nation.</p>
<p>What we have said is certainly political theory, but it is also the basic principle shown by the historical facts of past dynasties, and it is the conclusion of the current world war. The initial success of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was because the leaders accepted this iron rule of history, and its failure was the result of the leaders violating this principle. Shi Dakai therefore had the sigh of "My ambition has not been achieved, and the people are already suffering, with cries of sorrow everywhere in the southeast." The success of the Meiji Restoration in Japan and the collapse of the hegemony of Britain and the United States in the Far East are also due to adherence to or violation of the above principles.</p>
<p>We earnestly hope that the government will be cautious at all times and strive to consolidate the foundation it has established among the people, and enhance the government's prestige and respect among the people. To do this, it is necessary to extensively recruit talented people from the public to improve the political organization, to work hard to cultivate cadre talents to strengthen the political institutions, and to strictly implement performance evaluations to improve political efficiency. In order to actively and thoroughly reform the political style and rectify politics, we should at least quickly establish a public opinion organization similar to the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and the Imperial Rule Political Association of Japan, on the one hand to organize the scattered people into a great national force, and on the other hand to enable the national policies to be thoroughly implemented.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the East Asian situation, we cannot continue to let Japan bear the hardships alone and take the credit of Heaven; from the perspective of domestic affairs, we cannot sit idly by as the government separates from the people, causing the people's strength to drift away from the national policy. Today, we are discussing the way to prosperity and decline, and its first essential meaning, we believe, is as such. May the authorities pay close attention to this, then the nation will be fortunate!</p>

<h3 id="e2">Japanese Troops in Northern Henan and Southern Shanxi Achieve Victory; Capture Linxian, Lingchuan, and Linqi; Yu Army Commander Sun Dianying Surrenders with His Troops; Japanese Troops Continue to Advance Northwest of Linzhang <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Beijing, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from the front-line bases in Shanxi, Henan, and Hebei provinces, the Japanese army has been advancing north fiercely for days since starting new operations in Shanxi Province, and has forced the Yu army's "24th Army Group" to the Linxian area. At noon on the 23rd, the Japanese army stormed into Linqi, a major stronghold of the Yu army, and then completely occupied it. The Yu army in that area is in complete disarray, and the Japanese army is now launching a large-scale annihilation campaign in order to completely eliminate it. In this battle, Sun Dianying, the commander of the Yu army's "New 5th Army," unable to withstand the fierce attacks of the Japanese army, surrendered with his troops at 2:50 PM on the 24th to participate in the peace movement. In addition, a Japanese army unit turned from Linhong on the 24th and pursued the Yu army that was retreating northwest of Lijiazhai (8 kilometers west of Linqi), engaging in fierce fighting for about two hours. Over 1,000 Yu soldiers were captured, and 200 bodies were left behind. Furthermore, another Japanese army unit launched a fierce attack southwest of Linhong. On the morning of the 24th, 2,000 soldiers from the Yu army's "New 5th Army" surrendered at Beijiacun and Ziyangzhuang. Currently, all Japanese army units are working closely together to encircle and annihilate the 40,000 Yu soldiers in the Dongyuegou area west of Linqi.</p>
<p>Kaifeng, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain front-line location of the Japanese army in Hebei and Henan provinces, Sun Dianying, the commander of the Yu 24th Army Group's New 5th Army, has been leading his troops to fight in various places over the years, repeatedly encountering fierce attacks from the Japanese army. Recently, in view of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the significance of the Yu side's resistance has been completely lost. Since the National Government joined the war, the goal of national survival has become even clearer. Only under the leadership of Chairman Wang of the National Government can China be revived through joint cooperation with Japan. Therefore, he specifically announced his participation in the peace movement in the army's defense area a few days ago.</p>
<p>Beijing, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from the front line of the Japanese army in the southern Taihang Mountains on the 23rd, Japanese army units launched an attack from the southeastern part of Shanxi Province in order to suppress the Yu army entrenched in the provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan, capturing Lingchuan. On the 21st, they completely occupied Lingchuan, the garrison of the Yu army (27th) under Liu Jin. At the same time, they destroyed the Yu army headquarters in Hengshuizhen and continued to advance. Furthermore, another Japanese army unit that attacked from a certain place in southeastern Shanxi Province also encircled and annihilated the remnants of the Yu army, breaking into the provincial border on the 21st. In addition, Japanese army units that launched operations along the Beijing-Hankou Railway from Henan Province and advanced south from the Linhong Basin fiercely attacked the main force of the Yu (40th) Army, then captured Linxian, and destroyed all important military facilities of the Yu (24th Army Group) headquarters located in Lincun and nearby Taijianzhen and Langjiecun, continuing to advance south. Thus, the three armies advanced in three routes, shrinking the encirclement. The Yu army's 27th and 40th armies in the Linqi area were in a state of confusion, and the Yu New 5th Army was in a hopeless situation. In addition, the Japanese army advancing from southern Henan Province has made contact with the Japanese army units that broke into the provincial border and advanced south, forming a tight encirclement.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from the front line of the Japanese army in the provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan, in order to directly attack the stronghold of the Yu army's 24th Army Group, the Japanese army simultaneously began operations on the Beijing-Hankou Railway line on the night of the 20th. On the 21st, they occupied the forward positions of the Yu 24th Army Group's 40th Army near Madian Shuizhi Town, 14 kilometers west, and continued to pursue. On the 22nd, they advanced to Qiwucun, 28 kilometers southwest of Shuizhi Town, and engaged in fierce mountain warfare with 1,500 Yu soldiers who were stubbornly resisting by relying on the mountains west of the village, finally seizing the Yu army's fortified positions. They are still continuing to pursue. Furthermore, the Japanese army that advanced south from a certain direction broke into Linxian, an important base of the Yu 24th Army Group, at dusk on the 21st, and completely occupied it 45 kilometers west of Shuizhi Town in the provinces of Henan and Shanxi. They continued to attack, now advancing to the Hejianzhen area, echoing the Japanese army that moved north from a certain direction, and have encircled approximately 30,000 soldiers of the Yu 40th Army. In addition, Japanese bomber and fighter formations also responded to the ground forces on the 21st, strafing the main force of the Yu 10th Army and the Yu army positions on the mountains with machine guns, inflicting great damage.</p>
<p>Beijing, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain front-line location in Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan provinces, since the Japanese army units launched a northward offensive on the border of the three provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan, as of today, the Yu army has left behind 645 bodies and 3,129 have been captured. The Japanese army has seized 306 rifles, 17 pistols, 5 automatic rifles, 7 heavy and light machine guns, 5 mortars, 49 hand grenades, and a large number of other bullets.</p>
<p>Beijing, 24th (Central News Agency) - The National Government's Shanxi Communist Suppression Army is now cooperating with the Japanese army in fiercely attacking the Yu side's 24th Army Group near Linqi, Henan Province, in order to demonstrate the true spirit of sharing life and death. The Communist Suppression Army was formed in Shanxi last July and has been actively training, with its strength increasing day by day. This time, under the command of Zhao Sui, the commander of the 1st Division, and Yang Cheng, the commander of the 2nd Division, they cooperated with the Japanese army with the elite of the two divisions and achieved great results. The army has always maintained autonomous operations and is invincible wherever it goes.</p>

When the Chairman heard about this, he specifically issued handwritten instructions to Director Xu Wenguan yesterday, stating in brief: "Last year, on the occasion of Zhaoming's sixtieth birthday, because I did not prepare in advance, it resulted in temporary chaos, with banquets held at Ningyuan Building and birthday gifts going to the Cultural Relics Preservation Committee, causing all kinds of troubles, which was really annoying. This year, I declare in advance that all celebrations are declined. The good intentions of friends will not only not be appreciated, but will also cause resentment. It is better to let things rest and remain peaceful, which is more appropriate." These instructions fully embody the noble intention of practicing strict economy and correcting customs. It is deeply hoped that all parties will understand this.</p>

We must have a new national morality, which can be divided into eight points: (1) We must be courageous to do what is right and accept orders in times of crisis; (2) We must change from "prudent self-preservation" to "prudent national preservation"; (3) We must have a strong spirit of upward mobility; (4) We must cultivate a sense of responsibility; (5) We must be punctual and orderly; (6) We must not be intent on seeking private property, but we must find ways to store property in the country; (7) We must establish a correct outlook on life. Individual lives are very short, but the life of the nation is endless; (8) We must work hard to improve ourselves.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a Sydney report, sources close to General Macworth, the Supreme Commander of the Anti-Axis Southwest Pacific, said that the active preparations of the Japanese army in the Southwest Pacific are a prelude to a large-scale attack on Australia. The Japanese side is also actively improving its air force, and new and fast fighter planes have been frequently discovered there.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from a certain Japanese military base in the south, the enemy army, in order to reverse its decline, has repeatedly and illegally attacked Japanese hospital ships, engaging exclusively in guerrilla tactics and publishing false war results. Recently, the enemy air force has changed its tactics in the Southwest Pacific, blindly bombing innocent villages and residences, disregarding humanitarianism, and repeatedly launching planned attacks on field hospitals. For example, at 11:00 PM on the 8th of this month, five BO246 unified-type aircraft took advantage of the moonlight and flew over a field hospital near a certain Japanese military base, dropping a dozen bombs on the hospital, resulting in a number of deaths and injuries. The enemy planes fled immediately after dropping the bombs. This kind of atrocity is clearly a planned attack by the enemy. Although the enemy planes clearly saw the hospital built on the hill, with a red cross symbol painted on the roof, they still carried out this atrocity, which shows their brutality. Moreover, the enemy planes always bomb at night, so that they can deny it afterwards, claiming that they could not identify the target at night.</p>

According to a report from San Francisco, the Australian side has expressed deep gratitude for the Japanese army's preferential treatment of prisoners of war. Australian citizens have recently received reliable news that Australian prisoners of war in Singapore are well-treated in all aspects, including food, clothing, and shelter. Therefore, the general public has expressed gratitude for the treatment by the Japanese army.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Manpower Shortages in the United States Form Serious Problem; Military Production Cannot Be Expanded; Extreme Panic Also Felt Regarding Food <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 24th (Central News Agency) - Due to manpower shortages, the expansion of military production in the United States has been impossible, and this has already formed a serious problem. Moreover, the army and navy's expansion plans and the rise in product prices have had a significant impact on Roosevelt's war policies. A special correspondent for the Swedish newspaper "Nidung" wrote on the 20th about the serious situation of the current manpower shortage in the United States. The original text stated that the US government deeply feels that it is necessary to obtain seven million workers by the end of 1943, so that two-thirds of them can supplement the conscripted personnel. The Human Resources Committee plans to mobilize two million women workers, one million welfare recipients, and one million young people reaching working age. Currently, there is a high demand in various aspects of the United States to promptly implement mandatory labor. At the same time, some people advocate reducing the conscription age to the minimum of seventeen years old, in order to obtain manpower. This problem has had a significant impact on both the agricultural and military industries. In particular, the lack of rural labor has caused a nationwide food panic in the United States. The US Wartime Information Bureau also warned the public on the 15th that we must realize that in 1942, the United States will experience a panic in food and other necessities of life. In fact, the United States is currently not only experiencing a considerable shortage of food, but also finds it difficult to purchase potatoes. In addition, the rationing system is not perfect, and the distribution system has not yet been implemented, so prices are unusually high. Therefore, the voices of the general public criticizing this situation are growing louder. In addition, the US people's cost of living index is also increasing day by day. The US "Economic Magazine" commented on its recent situation, saying that regarding the shortage of food rationing and production in the United States, we can clearly understand this by looking at the current implementation of the points system and the small amount of rationing. The quantity of meat, dairy, and oil stipulated in it is very small compared to the usual living standards of Americans. Moreover, the allocation of the sixteen kinds of materials under the point system, with the weekly ration per person, is not much more than that of the United Kingdom. From this, it can be seen that the current quantity of milk, eggs, and poultry in the United States is also no longer abundant. Moreover, due to the unreasonableness of the rationing system and the fact that general merchants are using wartime inflation for speculation and hoarding, the food panic problem is becoming more serious. However, rural parliamentarians are using this situation to try to raise agricultural prices and are constantly making demands, even engaging in head-on conflicts with the government, leading to political problems. This is because US Senator Bankhead advocated in his proposal that government subsidies should be removed when stipulating the balanced prices of agricultural products. Although this case was rejected by Roosevelt on April 2nd, the views of rural parliamentarians still believe that raising agricultural prices is enough to stimulate farmers and solve the food panic problem. Therefore, when Congress voted on the (Bankhead Act), they said that if farmers are not given a strong stimulus now, the US food problem will fall into extreme panic, and the result may cause the war to fail. Another main reason for the lack of food in the United States is that, according to the Lend-Lease Act, the United States must ship 25 percent of its domestic food production abroad.</p>

<h3 id="e27">War Diary from the Burma-India Front (1) <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Rangoon, 14th) - The enemy's attempt to recapture Burma has completely vanished as a daytime illusion due to the valiant efforts of the Japanese troops stationed in Burma. However, the enemy's attempt to recapture Akyab was truly a desperate attack. Therefore, overcoming all the harsh conditions of the extraordinary terrain and the scorching climate—a heat that practically burns the earth—and the "primitive" environment teeming with wild elephants, and repelling the enemy, the hardships of the Japanese soldiers in that area were even greater than those on the Southwest Pacific front. The encircling annihilation battle unfolded on the Maungdaw Peninsula was the culmination of this battle. This newspaper's special correspondent Mishima, in order to catch up with the troops participating in this battle, crossed the Maungdaw River, traversed the steep Maungdaw Mountains from near Yua Kyit, and endured hardships for four days, bathing in the enemy's gunfire and bullets, seeking refuge from enemy planes in caves, and eating only one meal a day, finally reaching the destination. The Japanese front-line troops, who were deploying an encirclement chain on the Maungdaw Peninsula, were clearing the jungle, breaking through stubborn enemies along the coastal area, and are now driving the enemy beyond the northern bank of the Naf River and into the national border. The Japanese troops there are currently enduring daily lack of supplies, heat, sleeplessness, and hardships while fighting. Moreover, what is most noteworthy here is that the hardships of the Japanese soldiers have continued completely since the enemy's Lancashire Regiment attempted to advance at the end of last year. We should think about the hardships of the many brave Japanese soldiers who are still continuing their fierce decisive battles in the inaccessible jungles and wild lands and the scorching marshlands! The following is Mr. Mishima's war diary.</p>
<p>(Special Correspondent Mishima's Dispatch from the Maungdaw Front Line on the Southern India-Burma Border, 14th) - If the characteristic of the Southwest Pacific front is said to be a stage of countless islands and dense forests that cover them, where all supply difficulties are endured under the enemy planes' stubbornness, then the Maungdaw River front, under the same conditions, is being called the land-based Southwest Pacific front. The area of operations, centered on the Maungdaw River and spanning Akyab, Rathedaung, and Maungdaw, is crisscrossed by countless rivers and streams, and operations must rely on boats to proceed. The attack from one island to another is also completely like this. Moreover, the rivers and streams here are different from those on the China front, most of them have a river width of more than 300 meters, and enemy gunboats often appear in them, causing many difficulties for the Japanese army's rear transportation. Now that the battle has shifted to the Maungdaw Mountain area, difficult battles are continuing on the steep mountain ridges where the roars of wild elephants are often heard, with manpower being used to transport artillery and supplies. The reporter, having the opportunity to accompany the troops on this front, was able to fully experience the hardships of the soldiers. The following is the record of this troop accompaniment.</p>
<p>March 31st</p>
<p>Our boat, which departed from Akyab at 9:00 PM last night, moved forward in the crisscrossing rivers and streams, relying on starlight, led by the naval engineers. The night was starry, and fireflies appeared on the ground, creating an interesting scene. After 2:00 AM, it reached a shoal and could not move forward. This was during the great ebb tide before moonrise, and it temporarily anchored, waiting for the overwhelming tide to come. It waited for about an hour. During this time, continuous artillery fire was heard from the front, as well as machine gun sounds, indicating that fierce battles were taking place in the front. Soon, it reached the first destination, and it was planned to cross the Maungdaw River and reach the vicinity of the Maungdaw Mountains, but an enemy gunboat was discovered lurking behind the island near the river crossing point. It was said that our troops who had just returned from crossing the river were subjected to tracer projectiles, and they immediately responded with anti-tank guns mounted on the boat, and one of the boats' heavy oil tanks was hit by a tracer projectile and caught fire. In addition, several crew members were also injured. The gunshots that we heard during the temporary anchoring were what happened at that time. The commander of the naval engineer squad, Terai, who had lost many subordinates at once, expressed his voice very tragically. The headquarters of the troops who had already crossed the river wanted to contact them by telephone, but because there was a river in the middle, the telephone could not be heard clearly. It was dangerous to send a signalman to notify them, so it seemed that they were planning to stop moving forward that night. However, everyone was eager to cross the river, and the mountain guns were also brought, and it was believed that the situation might be the same tomorrow night, so it was decided to put the mountain guns on the boat to fire in order to cover the boat, and finally decided to forcibly cross the river. The Maungdaw River is about 2,000 meters wide and takes ten minutes to cross. If it can reach the riverbank on the opposite side without being discovered during these ten minutes, there is no danger. A moment later, it was finally in the Maungdaw River. Suddenly, the leading boat fired three anti-tank guns, knowing that it had been discovered, but the enemy's machine gun sounds were not heard. Our mountain guns also fired two shots, and the heavy machine guns also began to fire. Finally, in an unnatural silence, it entered the riverbank on the opposite side. An enemy gunboat was discovered near the sandbar, and our side took the initiative and immediately fired at it. When it finally reached the landing point, the east was slightly white. From here to the headquarters of the destination troops, it is about two kilometers. If the day is bright, enemy planes will definitely attack. On the way, it encountered enemy bombing planes flying overhead twice, but nothing happened, and it finally arrived at the headquarters of the troops safely. Enemy planes have been constantly attacking these days, and they fly very low, and our side often uses guns to shoot them. It is said that just now, a soldier was discovered while walking, and the soldier continued to shoot at the enemy plane until he was injured and fell to the ground. Therefore, the headquarters of the troops dug horizontal holes on both sides of the dry riverbed to hide in. As soon as we arrived at the headquarters, the enemy's whirlwind fighters also came, flying 100 meters above our heads, and the insignia of the British Air Force could be seen clearly. They soared there for about an hour without leaving.</p>
<p>April 1st</p>
<p>Enemy planes come five or six times a day, so we cannot even think about cooking and eating during the day. Everything is prepared at night, and there are only two meals a day, morning and evening. At dusk, in order to catch up with the 〇〇 unit on the front line, the reporter was introduced by Second Lieutenant Miyake of the headquarters and set off with two guards. The road gradually entered the Maungdaw Mountains, and the slopes were connected and alarming, and it was a dense forest area. We advanced through gaps that even dogs could not pass through. Although the sky was full of stars, it was so dark in the dense forest that we could hardly touch our noses. The danger at our feet was needless to say. In such a difficult situation, the soldiers silently transported supplies and ammunition all night. Because rear transportation was difficult, except for personnel absolutely necessary for combat, no one crossed the river. Therefore, the transportation of supplies and ammunition was generally undertaken by the soldiers on the front line themselves. On the front line, the supplies that were brought earlier were running out, and if this continued, they would have to wait for the planes to drop supplies for relief. However, ammunition and supplies are the most important, and they must be transported even at the cost of death. The soldiers who were transporting were almost without normal meals, their stomachs empty, their legs shaking, carrying heavy ammunition and supplies. The soldiers' hard work cannot be described in words.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports that the British army in the western sector of the Tunisian bridgehead attempted to drive the Axis forces out of the area occupied during Wednesday's counterattack, but the result was ineffective. The British Eighth Army, led by General Montgomery, repeatedly attacked the Axis forces' mountainous positions in the south on Thursday, but it was still difficult to break through due to the strong resistance of the German and Italian armies. The British army, having repeatedly failed to break through the southeastern flank of the Axis forces in the past three days, has now adopted attrition tactics to trap the other side. On Thursday, the British Eighth Army's artillery, under the accurate fire of the Axis motorized artillery and the fierce attacks of the German and Italian air forces, spared no ammunition in order to break through the Axis forces' solid defensive works. Its infantry also charged forward under artillery fire, but were all thwarted by the Axis forces' fierce artillery fire at close range. British and New Zealand troops engaged in hand-to-hand combat with German and Italian troops in many places, but the result was still unable to gain a foothold. All mountain gaps are still in the hands of the Axis forces. In the western sector of the front line, the Axis forces' offensive between Mettejeel Baub and Bu Adala was quite successful, causing the British army to feel that their position was dangerous and had to pay a great price to recapture the lost area. British infantry, assisted by French troops, launched simultaneous attacks in several places after their artillery had bombarded fiercely. The minefield in front of the Axis forces' positions gave the attackers a great blow. Seeing the situation was not good, the British army attempted to bypass the minefield, but unexpectedly fell into the Axis forces' fire net, and casualties increased. This was greatly unexpected by the British army, and the plan to break through the Axis positions failed again. The Anti-Axis forces have suffered great sacrifices in manpower and material resources in the entire battlefield of the Atlas Mountains, but the result has been a complete failure. They have had to admit the superiority of the Axis forces' positions, as the German and Italian armies were able to arrange defenses based on the terrain. Yesterday's communique from General Eisenhower's headquarters stated that the British Eighth Army suffered heavy losses due to the Axis forces' attack on its base on Thursday. According to Anti-Axis sources, the British First Army began an offensive in the Bu Alada area with three infantry groups at around 2:00 AM on Friday. According to a report from General Anders' headquarters, Duphaz was being threatened from the northwest, and French rebel forces were fiercely defending the city's perimeter. The British Eighth Army claimed to have occupied Teckrona, several miles northwest of Enfitville, after the naval battle, and is continuing to advance northwest towards Zaghouan. It is said that Marshal Rommel has built the greatest defensive works in that area, and it is reported that General Montgomery has transferred the Indian 4th Division as the vanguard force to participate in the fierce battle that is about to erupt. At the same time, the German and Italian air forces continue to assist the army in its operations. On Thursday, German bombing aircraft attacked British tanks and motorized transport units. On Thursday, German and Italian fighter planes shot down a total of sixteen British and American aircraft, including seven four-engine bombers.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from the Eastern Front, the German army finally achieved a decisive victory in the battle at the mouth of the Kuban River on the 23rd. After gaining control of the war situation, the German army used tank units as the vanguard and forcefully broke through three Soviet positions. The mechanized units continued to advance, trying to expand the scope of the breakthrough. The main Soviet forces north of Manslenikov, although still resisting hard, have fallen into a crisis of being surrounded and annihilated. It is reported that the Soviet army in the area is collapsing and retreating.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - The German official news agency announced last night that on Thursday, German troops completed their mop-up offensive in the vast area south of the Kuban River and near the front line in the Novorossiysk area. The German army's artillery was also active in the Donets area. At the same time, Soviet aircraft were shot down by the Soviet air force and other Axis troops on the Eastern Front on Thursday, and transportation and supply equipment were bombed. It is said that twelve Soviet aircraft were shot down in the Kuban bridge area, and another twenty-one were shot down by Finnish fighters. Soviet artillery on the Donets front received a large number of reinforcements and launched a fierce bombardment of Soviet positions. In the marsh area south of Lake Ilmen, German engineers and sappers destroyed Soviet positions and repelled Soviet troops who attempted to recapture the positions. On Sunday night, German bomber squadrons concentrated on attacking the Soviet naval base in Poti on the Caucasian Black Sea coast, dropping bombs on the port facilities despite heavy anti-aircraft fire, causing several fires that could be seen even from a distance of 100 kilometers.</p>

<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Helsinki, after US Minister to Finland Schofield returned to Washington, there were various rumors about the relations between the US and Finland. On the 23rd, all members of the US Embassy in Finland flew to Stockholm, Sweden, based on government instructions, and arrived there that day. Only Chargé d'Affaires Councillor Kleintk, a female secretary, and a telephone operator remained. According to a report from Buenos Aires, the US State Department has consistently refused to disclose the truth about the withdrawal of the US Embassy staff in Finland, only saying that there has been no change in the relationship between the US and Finland due to this reduction in staff.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a reporter from the HTT news agency here, the staff of the US Embassy in Finland arrived here by special plane at 4:30 PM yesterday. Yesterday was Good Friday, and the weather was warm, and most diplomats and journalists were visiting the countryside, so the news of their arrival was learned very late in political circles, and therefore no explanation could be obtained from the qualified parties. In any case, the most well-informed sources in Stockholm were also surprised by this matter. The interpretation here is that this is the final preparation for the severance of relations between the US and Finland.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Washington, the US State Department announced yesterday that the transfer of most of the staff of the US Embassy in Finland to Stockholm, Sweden, was an administrative measure and that there were no new developments in US-Finnish relations. US Minister to Finland Schofield returned to Washington several months ago and is still in the US.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Public Discontent After Release of News of American Aircraft's Disastrous Defeat <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Argentine Capital, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since the disastrous defeat at Pearl Harbor, the wartime intelligence bureau and the army and navy departments of the United States have fabricated war reports. Not only is this not believed by people around the world, but it has also been criticized by the people within the country. This time, the US propaganda bombing of Tokyo was another failure by the US wartime intelligence bureau and the military, which aroused dissatisfaction in the media. After Davis, the director of the wartime intelligence bureau, stated that the truth would be revealed on the anniversary of the US aircraft bombing of Tokyo, the US Department of the Army, because it had already issued a fabricated announcement in May 1942, was deeply afraid of exposing flaws after the truth was revealed, and opposed it to the White House. However, after the director of the Japanese Army's reporting department released the details of the US aircraft's attack on Japan, the US wartime intelligence bureau could no longer suppress domestic public opinion, so it had no choice but to announce the situation of the US aircraft's air raid on Tokyo on the 21st. However, this announcement was completely different from the previous announcement by the Department of the Army, which caused unanimous dissatisfaction in the American media. For example, the New York Times stated that the American people and the American news media do not want to hear fabricated news, because it harms the reputation of the American military. Unfortunately, the Department of the Army did not adopt this policy, and this time the announcement of the US aircraft bombing of Tokyo is very misleading and difficult to explain. It is still remembered that when President Roosevelt awarded Doolittle a medal last May, the US military headquarters stated that no American aircraft were shot down during the air raid on Tokyo, or did not return to base due to injuries. However, this announcement stated that no American aircraft returned to base safely, and only one aircraft detained in Siberia was not damaged. Such contradictions are very ridiculous. The Lynchburg Report in Virginia also criticized the same, saying that it is difficult to avoid public dissatisfaction after the Department of the Army releases important news, but the American people have already known that they have been deceived by the authorities in the past after the US aircraft bombing of Tokyo was announced. To this day, Americans will not forget the US aircraft's air raid on Tokyo, and they will also deeply remember that they were deceived by the authorities.</p>

<p>Various countries are studying and improving this method. In the enemy's camp, Britain applied it first, and the United States also obtained this patent last year and began manufacturing. As for our country, we have recently created something more advanced than the British and Americans, and it is deployed at various key points. This method has a great impact on aircraft and submarine warfare.</p>
<p>The progress and improvement of such war materials, whether earlier or later than the enemy, will naturally have a great impact on the transfer of operations and can also influence the war situation. Therefore, scientific technology must make rapid progress in the fields of weaponry, clothing, food, and hygiene. Especially today, the state of war has undergone tremendous changes. In order to establish a unified wartime and production posture and to seize the initiative in the war, the following items must be paid special attention to:</p>
<p>(1) Aircraft: The development of aircraft, in terms of speed and range, and the improvement of armaments and armor, depends on the progress of various other weapons and materials. In the future, it will be a truly major decisive weapon. The ultimate question of aircraft development is another matter. At present, it is extremely important to be one step ahead of the enemy and be superior to the enemy.</p>
<p>(2) Against Airborne Weapons: Due to the development of aircraft, the development of anti-aircraft weapons and air defense materials is naturally also important. If, in addition to using aircraft to deal with aircraft as the primary goal, the firearms that move horizontally on the ground and are fired for the purpose of targeting are reformed in three dimensions, it is not enough to completely rely on their capabilities.</p>
<p>It is rumored that a certain country has recently created a device that can use radio waves to stop the engines of aircraft flying within one or two thousand meters. Although the truth of the matter is unknown, the dream of using radio waves and other methods to wipe out a group of aircraft flying in the sky and cause them to crash will surely become a reality in the short term.</p>
<p>(3) Ships: No matter how much damage ships suffer, it is necessary to build a large number of new ships to make up for the losses in the war, endure the enemy's transportation disruption warfare, and further defeat the enemy's transportation disruption warfare. This is one of the powerful means to end this war. Regarding ships, in addition to the need for rapid and large-scale production technology, it is necessary to complete the task of transporting supplies to the front-line troops under the enemy's air supremacy and on the sea surface watched by submarines, and to undertake the task of transporting production between raw material locations and production locations far apart. Existing ships cannot be competent, and special research must be carried out.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned leap in increasing production to expand combat power already has a solid Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere as its foundation, and due to the improvement and progress of combat materials, it is possible to always seize the initiative in the war situation and defeat the enemy's resistance at any time and place, and further launch an offensive. This has been fully elaborated in the Prime Minister's policy speech. As for "how to destroy the British and American will to war," this is the main point I am talking about today. For all wars, its end is more important than its beginning or its continuation. How to end the war is what those who are in charge of war guidance, and even the entire people, are constantly thinking about. However, ending the war is not something that military operations can do alone. It must rely on the simultaneous advancement of diplomatic and political strategies in all aspects. Once a war begins, its end is by no means something that can be expected in the short term.</p>
<p>We must not forget that the only way to end the war is to use real force to force the enemy into a humiliating surrender. If we, who are standing on the production front, harbor pacifist opinions in our words or in our thoughts, and do not establish a complete plan, it is equivalent to attacking the back of the soldiers on the front line with guns and cannons.</p>
<p>The United States has a bellicose and stubborn people. In this war, which takes the continent and the Pacific Ocean as its arena, even if we fully display the excellence of scientific technology, it will be difficult to destroy their will to war unless we strike the American mainland. The only difficulty in striking the British and American mainland is the distance of the Pacific Ocean. However, this distance is no longer a problem in the face of the great progress of aircraft. Our country has already solved this problem technically, and Germany and Italy are also preparing for an air raid on the American mainland. The day when Japan, Germany, and Italy echo each other from east to west and air raid the American mainland is not far away.</p>
<p>The United States is now widely rumored to be planning an air raid on Japan. They believe that Japan's wooden buildings cannot withstand air raids, so they want to defeat Japan by air raids. The small houses of Japan's wooden buildings are extremely resistant to air raid damage, and are easy to rebuild. The apartments where many families live in the United States, and the skyscrapers that Americans are proud of, are more susceptible to air raid damage. In particular, the high-rise buildings in the United States are extremely dangerous for the concentrated use of certain bombs because there is no consideration for earthquake resistance.</p>
<p>What I am talking about striking the American mainland is not a retaliatory, chronic, immune, and incomplete air raid that the British and Americans exchange with each other. We must have sufficient research and preparation, because once air operations begin, if we want to destroy the enemy's will to fight in one fell swoop, it cannot be achieved overnight.</p>
<p>Since the start of the Greater East Asia War, with the skillful and close coordination of political and strategic strategies, we have achieved great successes in surprise attacks and strong attacks during the extremely difficult initial battles. Finally, we captured strategic bases and important resource areas. The future war guidance will be based on the results of this great initial battle, giving full play to the omnipotence of scientific technology to increase production, improve combat materials, always seize the initiative in the war situation, defeat the enemy's resistance at any time and place, continue the offensive, and finally launch a major attack on the American mainland. The responsibility for this great task rests largely on the field of scientific technology. We earnestly hope that those who are engaged in the field of scientific technology should have the above-mentioned awareness, and be with the soldiers on the front line day and night, in the laboratory, in the factory, or even on the front line, to take on this great responsibility with the determination to die. (Sho: Translated from the April 15th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3 id="e36">The Inevitable Victory Posture of Scientific Warfare <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese army's good planning and brave fighting are unparalleled in the world, which no one doubts. The Japanese people's will to fight and unity are also the same. In this spiritual aspect, Japan's combat power is superior to that of Britain and the United States, which has long been recognized by both enemies and friends. Furthermore, the endurance, which has been regarded as the greatest weakness of Japan's combat power for many years, can now be disregarded because it has gained favorable political and economic positions and enormous resources as a result of the Greater East Asia War. However, the problem is how to send cutting-edge scientific weapons to the front lines in large quantities and quickly, which is the matter of technical production. The British and Americans' will to fight against Japan is based on this and filled with self-confidence. At the same time, what the enlightened people in the country are whispering about is nothing more than this point. Fortunately, the measures to increase the quantity of production capacity have been put on track after the previous parliamentary deliberations, and from the speech given by Director Sato of the Army Affairs Bureau on the 14th at the "Award Ceremony for the Army Technical Achievement Commemorative Medal," we know that the quality and level of Japanese science and technology are surpassing those of the enemy. Therefore, the people can sweep away their worries in all aspects of the total war and strengthen their belief in inevitable victory.</p>
<p>Major General Sato's great speech effectively expressed the grand scale of the war and the military authorities' resolute determination. Among them, he mentioned many confident examples regarding the improvement of weapons and military supplies. For example, "the warning device that uses ultra-short waves to predict enemy submarine or aircraft attacks" has now been developed to be connected to anti-aircraft guns to shoot down invisible aircraft. The British and American forces have repeatedly used this to annoy the Japanese air force generals, but "Japan has recently completed equipment that is far more advanced than the British and Americans" and is being deployed in various key points one after another. "What is there to be afraid of in air raids?" This is the awareness of the Japanese air defense array, and this awareness is born out of a scientific foundation. In addition, the success of special food, effective drugs for malaria, malaria immunization prevention methods, battlefield plastic surgery, etc., has all made Japan victorious in scientific warfare. From this great progress in air defense, food, and hygiene, it can be inferred that the superiority of Japanese science in active offensive weapons is imaginable. Major General Sato's statement about the possibility of air raids on the American mainland is proof of this.</p>
<p>The formidable distance across the Pacific Ocean is no longer a problem in the face of the progress of aircraft. The United States, as a measure to reverse its defeat, seems to be attempting to air raid the Japanese mainland with long-range bombers. We must be prepared for this to come. However, war is mutual. "Japan has already solved this problem technically," and in response to the Allied powers of Germany and Italy, "the day of air raids on the American mainland must not be far away," this is what Major General Sato said. The non-earthquake-resistant high-rise buildings in the United States are extremely dangerous for the "concentrated use of certain bombs." Japan is considering a strategy to completely "destroy the enemy in one fell swoop by joining air operations with all powerful other means." That is not just a hope. The scientific and technical power to realize this thing, which is given to the Japanese people, is far above the enemy, which is more than half evident from the one or two examples mentioned by the Director of the Army Affairs Bureau and the various researches that were commended that day. The attack on Pearl Harbor was indeed a bolt from the blue for them. Similarly, the American mainland will surely encounter this bolt from the blue. In order to make that day come sooner, we must make efforts nationwide, because Britain and the United States are our strong enemies. We must not be misled by the "peace theory of taking shortcuts," but only by using the direct attack method of force to defeat them.</p>
<p>The current war, as Prime Minister Tojo said, is "a daily competition between science and science, technology and technology." The science and technology of Japan, which is carrying out this scientific warfare, already has the confidence to win against Britain and the United States in its quality. However, what they rely on is their mass production capacity. The quantity and speed of Japanese scientific and technological power in weapons production must naturally be proven to be above them as well. We earnestly hope that scientific and technical personnel will rise up and constantly come up with scientific innovations that are one step ahead of the enemy. At the same time, we earnestly hope that the people will cooperate to translate these scientific innovations into actual production and realize them into combat power in large quantities and rapidly. The reason why the whole nation must greatly exert itself to enhance combat power lies in this. Our final victory is undoubtedly, but we must make it rapid and definite through effort and patience. (Ding: Translated from the April 16th Asahi Shimbun Editorial)</p>
<h3 id="e37">Methods for Victory in Scientific Warfare <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Science and technology are extremely important in modern total warfare. In the current stage of decisive battle, the intensification of the war of science and technology is self-evident. Giving full play to the excellence of science and technology not only makes the war situation develop advantageously, but also has the most basic task of causing the other party to lose the will to fight and creating the cause of victory. In this way, the country has issued unlimited demands on scientific and technical personnel, and the supreme command of the decisive battle requires rapid and leapfrog progress in Japanese science and technology. At the Army Technical Research Conference on the 14th, the Army Technical Achievement Medal was awarded to outstanding scientific and technical personnel who have contributed to the scientific front. This kind of national commendation is indeed of great significance.</p>
<p>War is the father of culture and the mother of creation. During this war, military equipment and operational materials have been improved and progressed day by day. Just looking at the commendations this time, such as the mobilization of the army due to the war system, the development of anti-tank weapons, aircraft technology, airborne wireless telephones, small air-cooled engines, high-quality fuels, fuel injection devices, oxygen generators for aviation, ultra-shortwave warning machines, calculations: the progress of aviation weapons, optical weapons, etc., the preparation of communication weapons, special food and beverages, the leap in military hygiene and medicine, veterinary medicine, the construction of hangars and war barracks, and the improvement of mosquito coils, etc., truly show the high level of Japanese military science and technology.</p>
<p>The development of Japan's heavy industry sector was originally relatively backward, so production science was rather slow. Recently, it has begun to leap forward.</p>
<p>In order to achieve final victory in the future, we should give full play to the value of the strategic bases and important resource areas that have already been captured and secured, and make use of the resources of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to increase production capacity. The current urgent task is to establish a winning posture for important industries such as aircraft, ships, aluminum, iron, and coal, so it not only requires individual efforts in production efficiency, but also urgently requests creation and research in the field of production science and technology.</p>
<p>In order to promote the leap in military and production science and technology, in addition to the fundamental basic research of natural science, there must be the cooperation of mental science and technology and a politics based on science. In other words, it is an urgent task to promote scientific and technological policies in scientific politics.</p>
<p>The first of these is to prepare and strengthen the scientific mobilization system. For example, unifying and reorganizing various public and private scientific research institutions, and setting up scientific research institutes, etc.</p>
<p>Second, seek the connection and integration of science and technology and industry, remove contradictions in management, and enable science and technology to make the greatest possible contribution to production enhancement. It is hoped that the technical departments in various control associations will have active activities.</p>
<p>Third, reward inventions and discoveries, promote their industrialization, establish scientific and technological promotion institutions, industrial experiment institutions, and popularize and improve scientific thought and scientific knowledge. Realize the new system of science and technology as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Finally, establish a compensation system for diligent inventors. Give spiritual preferential treatment to scientific and technical personnel. The Technical Achievement Medal and the Diligence Achievement Medal this time can be unified to set up a motion chapter system, and improve the operation of the national commendation system under the principle of rewarding merit and punishing misconduct. (Sho: Translated from the March 16th Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi Editorial)</p>

<p>The Sixth District of the Hongkou Navy is located at the intersection of the Chinese Concession and the Public Concession. Therefore, its household rice is given by the Shanghai Municipal Council according to the population in the Public Concession area. The food rations for residents in the Chinese Concession area are distributed by the district chief Zhao Tankang after being approved by the Food Bureau. The tenth term of household rice has been sold out, and the eleventh term of household rice has begun to be processed. The rice shops have paid and picked up the goods. The household rice for this term is two sheng per person, and the selling price is six yuan. However, the method for obtaining the rice purchase certificate has been slightly changed. Each rice purchase certificate must be stamped with the head of household's seal and the baojia address must be filled in before it is valid to prevent malpractices.</p>

<p>Since the district banquet tax has been taken back and operated by the Municipal Finance Bureau, the collection situation in various districts has been very prosperous, especially the tax revenue in the Nanshi District. Jiang Bingquan, director of the tax collection office, believed that the original staff was insufficient, so he specially requested and approved the Finance Bureau to add twelve employees to engage in supervision and tax collection to avoid evasion. The Finance Bureau has approved the application.</p>

<p>The English Times reported that after weeks of active preparation, the Chinese Children's Welfare Association decided to launch a fundraising campaign of 500,000 yuan today (the 25th), scheduled to end in one month. The association is in charge of two charitable organizations, with more than 400 children.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Distributing Fundraising Booklets <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a member of the association claimed that he believed that millions of residents in Shanghai would generously donate to this fundraising campaign. In the past five days, the fundraising committee has been busy preparing to print and distribute 100,000 letters and booklets for mailing. Major merchants in this port will assist in this campaign, and they will also solicit donations from their relatives and friends.</p>

<p>The letters they sent were quite simple and clear, but the booklets detailed the reasons for launching the fundraising campaign. The member deeply hoped that the public would be generous in their assistance, as the association needed 80,000 yuan per month. He also said that once the campaign was successful, the association would be able to obtain the 460,000 yuan shortage of the 960,000 yuan needed for the whole year from major shops and factories in this port.</p>

<p>In order to stabilize people's livelihood, the food authorities are actively planning and implementing the increase in production, strengthening control, and managing consumption of agricultural products, aquatic products, and animal products. Now, the authorities believe that the organization of the fish markets in Suzhou, Wujiang, Changzhou, Yangzhou, and other places needs to be clarified since their establishment, whether the institutions are sound, whether sales can be balanced, and the organization status of each market, the business situation in the last year, and the promotion situation this year. Yesterday, they specially ordered the aquatic product management authorities to investigate separately, list the reports. It is heard that after receiving the order, the bureau has formulated four types of fish market investigation forms, distributed them to various markets, and ordered them to be truthfully filled out and submitted to the bureau for verification and transfer within a limited time.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Discussion on the Application of the Law of Wealth Preservation (3) <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Buddha said, "If I don't go to hell, who will?" If you want to seek the welfare of the social group, you must first rescue the hellish life of the masses. The opposite of welfare is disaster. Only by ensuring that the masses have no disasters or dependencies can the peace, wealth, and honor of a few people be preserved. It is also said, "If all beings do not become Buddhas, I will not become a Buddha." If the masses are mostly poor and sick, the wealth of a few people will have no happiness to speak of. Therefore, serving society is a duty that everyone should fulfill. In this extraordinary period, welfare undertakings are numerous and complex. They can be broadly divided as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Three Losses to Be Addressed: Loss of education, loss of employment, and loss of love are the sources of social unrest. For example, if young people lose their education, they can easily go astray or fail to become useful talents and attempt to establish themselves. The Shen Bao newspaper's advocacy of scholarships is a very good intention. Unemployment leads to vagrancy and non-production, which affects public order. It is hoped that capitalists will open more factories to accommodate vagrants, and the government will find ways to provide relief, so that people can make the most of their talents and things can be used to their full potential, in order to achieve true peace. Loss of love is the greatest spiritual pain. It is hoped that wise teachers and religious figures will patiently guide and elevate love, which can further revitalize cultural undertakings. For example, Goethe completed a great work due to heartbreak, which is worth emulating.</p>
<p>(B) Three Sufferings to Be Relieved: Old age, sickness, and death are the great sufferings of human life. Nursing homes, hospitals, sanatoriums, material distribution associations, burial teams, and crematoriums have already been actively managed by social charities. Recently, Buddhist lay practitioners and doctors have proposed to establish a Buddhist Friends Sanatorium, which can provide elderly care, medical care, and a Buddhist hall for devout practice. Even at the time of death, they can happily hear the Buddha's name, their minds will not be confused, and they will surely be reborn in the Pure Land. It is hoped that the three sufferings will be universally relieved. The purpose is to admire the Buddha's compassion. Even non-Buddhist patients, regardless of religion, will be treated as friends, and they will be given treatment according to their circumstances, both physically and mentally. This is a grand wish, and it is hoped that great virtues at home and abroad will strongly support it.</p>
<p>(C) Three Abundances to Seek: Abundant blessings, abundant longevity, and abundant sons have been prayed for by people throughout the ages. Blessing is the meaning of great generosity. To enjoy blessings, one must undergo training and cultivation. It is hoped that home economics scholars and learned Confucians will hold more lectures on cultivating blessings, teaching the public to have manners, demeanor, and the qualifications to enjoy blessings. Longevity is the true meaning of health and long life. When celebrating the birthdays of respected elders, health experts should be invited to speak on longevity methods, housewives should be invited to talk about healthy living, and vegetarian food should be used, with the principle of not killing and promoting good deeds as the standard. Abundant sons are even more needed by the world and are the foundation of nationalism. If one suffers from having no children, one should treat other people's children as one's own or donate family wealth to support orphanages and refugee children's education centers. "Adversity strengthens the nation," and it is hoped that "abundant sons will strengthen the nation." In modern times, men and women are equal, and women are the main pillars of the family. To govern a country, one must first regulate one's family. Housewives have the responsibility of educating children and managing wealth, so the three abundances must also start with women. Therefore, to "preserve wealth," one must first "preserve women." "Virtuous women" are the "cause of wealth." Promoting women's self-cultivation is also a cause of public welfare.</p>
<p>In short, seek more "blessings" from yourself to prevent problems before they occur; take righteousness as "profit" and wealth can be preserved for a long time. Today, I respectfully listened to Mr. Zhang Yipeng's golden words, and I am extremely grateful and impressed. It is hoped that the public will introspect and restrain themselves, and strive for the future. I humbly offer my humble opinions, and I hope that the wise men at home and abroad will give more corrections, for which I would be fortunate. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e51">Each Joint Guarantee Designates a Hospital to Provide Free Anti-epidemic Injections; the Methods of the Two Concessions Are Very Similar <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>In addition to providing free cholera vaccinations to the people through various health departments and mobile health teams, the Public Concession's anti-epidemic campaign now designates a hospital in each joint guarantee area to provide injections specifically to residents of that area. Each Baojia chief specifies the time and orders the residents of each household within their jurisdiction to go for injections and obtain a vaccination certificate. No deliberate violations are allowed. However, exceptions are made for those with heart disease, kidney disease, pregnant women, and infants who are formally certified. The French Concession also adopts the same method, but does not designate hospitals. Instead, the health department sends personnel to be stationed and provide injections in each joint guarantee area, and the Baojia chief orders residents to go for injections at the specified time.</p>
<p>This Year's Cholera Epidemic Will Not Spread</p>
<p>According to the Datong News Agency's interviews with personnel from various health departments, the results show that they all believe that the early start and good performance of this year's anti-epidemic work in this city are sufficient to guarantee that the cholera epidemic this summer will not recur as it did last year. They also believe that even if cholera patients are discovered, they can be quickly cured, as the authorities have made perfect preparations for the treatment of cholera patients.</p>
<p>Preventing Other Infectious Diseases</p>
<p>At the same time, according to the Datong News Agency, the health authorities have not only strictly prevented cholera recently, but also actively prevented meningitis, typhoid fever, scarlet fever, malaria, and other diseases. The recent prevalence of meningitis in Chuzhou has attracted considerable attention from the health authorities in this city. In addition to deeply hoping that residents pay attention to health maintenance, they also plan to empty and dry the water in air-raid shelters and place them upside down to prevent the breeding of infectious bacteria.</p>
<p>160,000 People Injected in the Urban Area</p>
<p>The city's health bureau has been actively carrying out this year's anti-epidemic work for some time, such as generously raising funds, recruiting staff, cooperating with public and private medical institutions, organizing anti-epidemic teams, and setting up five general teams and forty-seven sub-teams to serve in Pudong, Nanshi, Shanghai West, Zhabei, and other areas. The news has been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that since the 16th of this month, each team has first implemented mobile injections in the areas where the disease occurred last year and in shantytown slum areas. Since the 20th, they have resumed comprehensive injections at designated locations in various areas. As of the 22nd, according to the weekly injection statistics reports from each general team, the central team injected 34,679 people, the Pudong team 23,791 people, the Nanshi team 33,858 people, the Shanghai West team 46,005 people, and the Shanghai North team 46,776 people, totaling 163,109 people. Various organs and groups in this city have also separately sent letters to schedule injections, and the work is very busy.</p>
<p>Nanshi Will Check Injection Certificates Next Month</p>
<p>Since the launch of comprehensive anti-epidemic work in the entire Nanshi district, the Nanshi Health Office injection teams stationed in the various Fanglian Bao offices have now been completely relocated to the important transportation areas and have begun to forcibly inject passers-by with anti-epidemic injections to ensure the health of citizens. It is reported that more than 60,000 people have been injected in the Nanshi district since the injections began. It is also heard that starting from the first day of next month, inspections will be carried out, and anyone who does not hold a vaccination certificate will be refused entry to Nanshi.</p>
<h3 id="e52">The Ministry of Justice Reaffirms Previous Orders to Urge the Formation of Lawyers' Associations <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Judicial Administration believes that in recent years, the number of lawyers registered to practice their duties in various places has been increasing, but very few have formed associations in accordance with the regulations. According to the revised Lawyers' Regulations, "Lawyers shall not practice their duties unless they join the Lawyers' Association," which is quite inconsistent. In the past, in order to safeguard the rights and interests of lawyers and ensure the discipline of lawyers, the Ministry had already issued orders to courts in various places to promptly urge lawyers in their respective areas to form associations in order to improve the organization and comply with laws and regulations. However, it has been found that the progress in various places has been delayed, which is quite inappropriate and easily leads to abuses. Therefore, the Ministry reiterates its previous orders, urging courts in various places to earnestly supervise the formation of associations in accordance with the law within one month of receiving the document for those that have not yet established lawyers' associations, and not to delay further. After receiving the order, the Shanghai judicial community has already begun to proceed in accordance with it.</p>

<p>The China Tobacco Rationing Association, in view of the fact that some illegal merchants refuse to comply with the price limits for selling rationed cigarettes and resell them at high prices to various cigarette shops in the suburbs of Shanghai in order to obtain huge profits, the Association is deeply indignant about this and, in order to eliminate this illegal phenomenon, has sent personnel to Pudong, Nanhui, Wusong, Gaoqiao, Dachang, and other places within the past few days to discuss cargo distribution procedures. It is expected that cargo distribution will be implemented in the near future. It is also learned that the authorities of the Association are determined to crack down on the black market for cigarettes, so they have dispatched a large number of Chinese and Japanese inspectors in pairs to be on duty all day to strictly implement the work stipulated in the 15 instructions that have been announced in order to prevent merchants from engaging in fraudulent practices. According to the person in charge of the Association, speaking to a Datong News Agency reporter, there should be no more forced bundled purchases of non-rationed cigarettes in the future, because the bundled cigarettes will be more expensive. Now that the Association has fully distributed goods, even non-rationed cigarettes must be sold in accordance with the price limits, otherwise their rationing rights will be revoked. It is also learned that if customers find that stores refuse to sell cigarettes or engage in other illegal activities, they can report them in writing to the Association on Hankou Road, and the Association can send inspectors to investigate thoroughly. However, as of now, no stores have been reported. As for the price limits for some of the unannounced cigarettes, they will be announced when the goods are distributed. In addition, all sectors hope that the parties concerned can control the selling price of the various miscellaneous brands of cigarettes newly produced by the Association on the market.</p>

<h3 id="e58">The Science of Victory (1) <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The reason why Japan achieved great victories in the Greater East Asia War in both the army and navy was not only due to the soldiers' bravery, loyalty, and patriotism, but also to the aircraft, tanks, guns, various excellent scientific weapons, as well as food, medicine, construction materials, etc. supplied to the battlefield. On the army side, the inventors of such winning weapons were awarded the Second Army Technical Merit Medal. The recipients of the medals and the main inventors are introduced below: (Tao: Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, April 17)</p>
<p>Small, Powerful Engine...Technicians Takao Kotani and Kenji Kato. Collaborators (Sumitomo)...</p>
<p>Those who completed the latest small, powerful engine and laid the foundation for the victory of our country's combat air force are Mr. Takao Kotani (38 years old), design section chief of the Nakajima Aircraft Tokyo Manufacturing Plant, and technician Kenji Kato, an experimenter at the plant, along with other collaborators. However, this great invention itself has consumed enormous effort. The main part of modern warfare is air combat, so countries are constantly pursuing the development and progress of aircraft. During wartime, today's weapons must never be used as tomorrow's weapons. Therefore, the time spent starting a new design until its completion is greatly shortened, as aircraft are required to be produced as quickly as possible. That is, the emergence of new aircraft is most urgent. The small, powerful engine recently designed by technician Kotani was completed in just zero months, which can be said to be a great achievement in such a short period of time in the history of manufacturing. Its horsepower is so strong that it is only surpassed by the world's great powers. It particularly improves the performance of the main moving parts around the cylinder, the crankshaft housing, the brake, the lifter, and the carburetor, and also simplifies the driving. Its performance is indeed very excellent in terms of output area and weight compared to what has been produced recently by the world's great powers.</p>
<p>In our country's aviation technology camp, technician Kotani, who has contributed so many elite aircraft to the air force, and technician Kato, who believes that victory over the enemy countries of Britain and the United States must be achieved through science, jointly began the new design of a powerful engine. Because air-cooled engines were previously slightly larger in the front than water-cooled engines and were not suitable for small, high-speed aircraft, they constantly researched the problem. As a result, they completed the work of reducing the frontal area on the negative side and extremely increased the "output" of the unit volume on the positive side. This is how they announced the great success of the epoch-making small, powerful engine. Recently, from the military to the people, everyone has been selflessly assisting in promoting its realization in order to manufacture this type of aircraft. Even Sumitomo and other material companies have provided great assistance. As a result, talented people from the military and civilians have been concentrated. A manufacturing integrated system was established in the factory, so that the design, work, research, experiment, and other departments were organically coordinated and continued production desperately. The cooperating companies broke through the lack of materials and continuously provided the necessary raw materials, and the employees kept working with a spirit of forgetting food and sleep. Thus, the new elite small, powerful engine was quickly delivered in the first batch of production due to the excellent design of technician Kotani, the appropriate experiment of technician Kato, and the integrated production of the plant. Technician Kato, who was responsible for the experiment, completed this work while suffering from illness. One employee's father died, but he did not send out an obituary and did not let outsiders know, and continued working until the great success was achieved. This enthusiasm is truly a touching story that moves heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Technician Kotani said, "No matter how good the design is, it is impossible to achieve results in a short period of time without the help and cooperation of good collaborators. Especially today when time is precious, it is entirely due to the collaborators that it could be completed in such a short period of time. At the same time, all the glory and fame can be said to have been won by all those involved."</p>

<p>The Yongkang Cup small ball league, with forty participating teams, is scheduled to open at Xuhui Middle School at 3:00 PM today. Two exhibition matches are scheduled, with Wang Yongkang performing the opening kick-off, and Zhou Bangjun and Wang Yuzhai giving speeches. At 3:00 PM sharp, Xuhui will face Hequn in the first game. The former has strong strength, with Gao Zhiwen, Wang Wentao, Mai Ersen, Xu Defa, and others. Their battle record is outstanding, repeatedly defeating strong enemies, and their reputation is growing. Hequn is the runner-up in the West Union this year's Group C. They have many fierce generals under their command, such as Xiao Ziwen, Tang Zuowen, Pan Honghai, Zhu Meilong, and Lei Shuhua. At that time, there will be fierce competition with Xuhui. At 4:00 PM, Qinhua will face Nanguo. It is learned that Qinhua has come to Shanghai from Beijing this time to participate in the performance. The lineup is strong, with Yue Renxiao, Wang Cuixing, Hu Hanwen, and He Jiatong defending, and Ma Baozheng and Fei Chunhua attacking. Nanguo is a rising strong team, with former Samsung veterans Dong Jincai, Feng Shoupeng, Wu Shaotai, Yu Zhenyue, and others.</p>

<p>The Zhendan scholarship football charity match was held at the school's stadium yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM with great enthusiasm. Donghua declined after flourishing and lost to Zhendan 4-3. The charity ball auction was won by iron industry tycoon Mr. Shao Yongfang, who automatically bid the highest price of 20,000 yuan, which is commendable for his enthusiasm. Wang Fu, Dai Linjing, Xu Wenkui, Liang Shutang, Zhang Banglun, and others from Donghua did not play yesterday, which greatly weakened their strength. Zhendan relied on the efforts of Sun Jinshun, Fu Si, and Xu Erz to lay the foundation for the victory. Thirty-five minutes after contact, no record was opened. Wang Xisheng swept into the goal after a fierce battle, and Wei Jian Dai Long wo-shot. Not willing to show weakness, Zhendan launched a full attack. Yao Chong was eager and missed, and Sun Jinshun scored, ending the first half. In the sound of re-battle, Zhendan United's Yan Xingxiang touched the ball with his hand and was penalized with a penalty kick. Han Longhai took the penalty and scored. In the fourteenth minute, Donghua's Li Ning asked to perform a "rebellion," and good luck came, and Zhang Zhaopeng fouled. Sun took the penalty and scored. Fu En made his contribution in the midst of thousands of troops and horses, and Zhendan won 4-3.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Economic Circles: Translated Articles: The Departure of Financial Circles' Self-Discipline <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Taking advantage of the opportunity of the hoarding problem, both Chinese and Japanese parties hope that Chinese financial institutions should immediately practice self-discipline. Vice Minister Chen also mentioned this point in his speech on the 22nd, revealing the National Government's determination on this matter. It is expected that after Minister Zhou returns to Beijing, he will convene a meeting of the relevant heads of financial control. It is heard that this meeting will put forward a proposal on the reorganization and merger of banks and money shops. The reason for putting forward this reorganization and merger proposal is that financial practitioners use their capital for hoarding or speculation, or lend it to the business community for the purpose of hoarding. Observing the business content of the banking sector recently, the amount of deposits received by the member banks of the Banking Association is about 1.9 billion yuan, of which the amount of deposits received by 11 banks such as Zhejiang Industrial, Continental, Salt Industry, Jincheng, China, Communications, Central South, and China Reclamation is about 700 to 800 million yuan. The total amount of deposits received by the member money shops of the Money Shop Association is about 600 to 650 million yuan. The total amount of deposits received by both the banking and money shop industries is about 2.5 billion yuan. On the banking side, the amount of loans is about 1.56 billion yuan, and the amount of loans from money shops is about 500 to 550 million yuan. Looking at it in detail, time deposits account for 20% of the total deposits, and demand deposits account for 80%. Before the incident, time deposits accounted for more than 60%, and demand deposits accounted for only less than 40%. Comparing the two periods, it can be seen that the current business is not sound. If it is not rectified, the establishment of a wartime economic system will be hindered, and various measures such as currency, materials, and prices will encounter major difficulties. Due to this unsound organization, hoarding incidents also occur.</p>
<p>In order to concentrate capital on cultivating combat power, Japan implements national financial control. However, the financial circles in Shanghai are the opposite, with no control at all, like a pile of loose sand. Capital is only seeking profits. The National Government cannot tolerate any hesitation and should urgently establish a wartime economic system. The first step should be to reorganize and cooperate the more than 150 banks and 1,000 money shops, trust companies, real estate companies, etc., so that all banks, money shops, and companies comply with the regulations for the crackdown on financial institutions. For example, a financial enterprise with a capital of 1 million yuan is not allowed to use millions of yuan to purchase materials, or obtain funds with this as collateral, and is not allowed to engage in speculation such as purchasing materials. At the same time, banks that provide loans for hoarding and speculation are not allowed to exist. Here are a few concrete measures for reference:</p>
<p>(1) Reorganize and merge various small financial institutions that are harmful and unhelpful.</p>
<p>(2) Set a statutory payment reserve for deposits.</p>
<p>(3) Suppress bad loans.</p>
<p>(4) Implement bank supervision measures, etc.</p>
<p>At the same time, the lower-level organization of the Commercial Coordination Association should be prepared as soon as possible to promote the exchange of materials, open exchanges, absorb spot goods to the market, concentrate floating capital here, and stimulate production. Thus, the national capital flowing into speculation can be guided to the direction of national goals such as developing industries and increasing production.

<p>The Commerce and Trade Council instructed all industry federations to establish themselves before the end of this month. Regarding the Cotton Products Federation, after the responsible persons actively organized it, the major preparations are now complete. Its subordinate institutions are divided into: (1) the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Three Provinces Cotton Products Federation, including yarn mills, cotton cloth businesses, dyeing and weaving businesses, knitting businesses, native cloth businesses, underwear businesses, cotton batting businesses, quilt cover and blanket market businesses, handkerchief businesses, etc.; (2) the Central China Japanese Cotton Products Federation, including Japanese-owned textile businesses, cloth factories, knitting businesses, etc.</p>
<p>Additionally, a Sino-Japanese Council is Formed</p>
<p>In addition to the Sino-Japanese Cotton Products Federations, a Sino-Japanese Council will be organized to decide on various proposed measures and to discuss future actions. Furthermore, an organization for the cotton control association is attached to deal with matters such as the purchase of cotton.</p>
<p>Textile Mills Switching to Other Production</p>
<p>It is also learned that textile mills in this city are facing a severe shortage of cotton recently, causing the number of Japanese-owned textile mills in operation to decrease from 20% to 1.7%. Most Chinese-owned textile mills have already ceased operations, and those still in operation are fewer than the Japanese-owned ones, only 1.5%. As a result, Chinese textile mills are following the lead of Japanese textile mills in adjusting their equipment and switching to other industrial production.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Ten Industry Trade Associations Handling Member Registration <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Economic Bureau has designated the initiators of ten industry trade associations, including cotton, and has set a deadline of the end of this month for their establishment. Except for the industrial oil and new medicine trade associations, which already held their inaugural meetings yesterday (the 24th), the cotton and grain trade association and the cloth shop trade association are scheduled to hold their inaugural meetings separately today (the 25th). The tobacco sales trade association is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting on the 28th of this month. The remaining five industry trade associations, including the coal shop trade association, are expected to be fully organized within the next week. According to the regulations of the Provisional Regulations for Industry and Commerce Trade Associations, all industry and commerce trade associations must have companies and firms that genuinely operate in the respective industries first submit an application for approval and registration before they can join the respective industry trade association as members. Companies and firms that have not been registered and joined the respective industry association as members will be uniformly suspended from operation starting May 1st. It is reported that all industry trade associations require existing members of previous trade associations to re-register their membership.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that industry trade association offices located in the concession still need to register with the Trade Association Section of the Public Security Department of the Public Works Department. A form must be filled out, including (1) the name of the association, (2) the office location, (3) the name of the chairman (and a resume must be filled out), (4) the association's background relations, etc., and other reference points. Failure to register will prevent the association from carrying out its affairs within the concession. Additionally, industry trade associations and other organizations that need to convene general meetings or other meetings must also report to the Trade Association Section of the Public Security Department in advance, complete the application procedures, and wait for the bureau to issue a permit and send personnel to provide guidance.</p>

It is reported that the Money Industry Association has scheduled a fourth bottom internal market meeting for 3:00 PM on April 26th. In addition to publicly deciding on the "internal market quotation," it will also collectively discuss the handling methods for long-term credit loans. It is learned that the issue of long-term credit loans will be handled according to the following methods under the principle of tightening credit: (1) Efforts should be made to recover funds due at the fourth bottom, but those with a good credit history and legitimate uses will be allowed to proceed with flexibility. (2) New credit loans will be handled in accordance with the new measures to restrict loans passed by the silver and money industry association. (3) Applicants for new loans must state their purpose, limited to increasing production in various industries. Loans will only be granted after a qualified review.</p>

Both sides expressed their agreement to this. Finally, on the issue of promptly resolving seat allocation and distribution matters, the entire group expressed a unified opinion. The meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Speech by Vice Chairman Komuro: The work of the Commerce Control Council is the work of both China and Japan. Your council's work is our work. Based on this meaning, we hope to fully cooperate. In the past, those who divided the boundaries between China and Japan and acted independently were not politicians, but industrialists. Now that we bear this heavy responsibility, we do not need to worry about the difficulties and should do work that suits the actual situation. In the future, let us frankly exchange opinions and work together. We are also willing to fully cooperate to gather ideas and proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>Speech by Chairman Tang: It is most appropriate for both sides to open this conversation from the perspective of industrialists. The Chinese and Japanese business communities should take this opportunity to talk. Although Sino-Japanese cooperation has been advocated by all parties, economic cooperation is still in its initial stages. Taking advantage of the establishment of the Commerce Control Council, we must strengthen the content of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. If genuine cooperation can be realized, then national issues can also be resolved. I hold the determination to create a foundation for Sino-Japanese cooperation, and I believe that industrialists from both China and Japan are also engaged in the same attitude.

<p>Since the Municipal Food Bureau supervised the implementation of per capita grain distribution in the urban area, its purpose has been to alleviate the threat to food security in the urban area. However, it has been found that a small number of public rice selling points often fail to comply with the regulations and implement them effectively. Although the Food Bureau has repeatedly warned them, they still do not repent, which is deeply regrettable. In order to strictly rectify this situation, the bureau has specially issued another round of strict military and police warnings. If they violate the regulations again, their qualifications as public rice sellers will be revoked as a warning to others and to promote the rectification of the urban food policy.</p>

It passed the Implementation Outline for Materials Control and held several meetings of executive officers, deciding to establish industry association federations for major goods under the National Commerce Control Council, in order to complete the new system of wartime economic organizations. It is learned that the committee's second review meeting is scheduled to be held in Nanjing on the 26th of this month to discuss future implementation steps for materials control and the Commerce Control Council's proposed six major cases. It is reported that the committee members Tang Shoumin, Shao Shijun, and all executive officers in Shanghai will go to Nanjing to attend the meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Ministry of Food Promulgates Warehouse Regulations <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing News: In order to store rice and grains, the General Administration for Rice and Grain Procurement and Sales of the Ministry of Food has established warehouses in appropriate locations in various provinces and cities. Recognizing that although such facilities existed in the past, they were not perfect, it is learned that the Administration has promulgated the Provisional Organizational Regulations for Warehouses of the General Administration for Rice and Grain Procurement and Sales of the Ministry of Food on the 24th of this month, in order to eliminate past defects, make them more scientific, and facilitate management, so that local warehouses can be organized according to the regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Readers' Forum: A Thorough Solution to the Problem of Commodity Prices (II) <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Miao Zhonghui</p>
<p>( ) Rapid Establishment of Allocation Institutions: After the aforementioned investigation methods can be implemented, the subsequent solution is to nationalize all important materials and rapidly establish allocation institutions, which is the fundamental solution. If low-priced daily necessities can be allocated to the public, then the public's anxiety about life will be eliminated invisibly. The so-called "black market" will disappear without being destroyed. The establishment of this type of institution is urgent during wartime. Referring to the allocation systems in Japan and Manchuria, they are mostly based on households as units, forming the division of towns and districts, using a ship ticket system, and designating special stores to handle the allocation. This method has many advantages, but if used in our country, I am afraid that many abuses will arise. Taking the current allocation of sugar and oil as an example, not only will the entrusted stores cheat, but the baojia heads will also enrich themselves from it, I am afraid. The best way is for the government to establish a General Administration of Daily Necessities, dividing Shanghai into several districts, establishing an appropriate number of distribution offices in each district, and directly allocating goods to the public using a ticket system, without going through the hands of merchants, which can reduce one layer of exploitation. In this way, producers and consumers can join hands directly with the introduction of government agencies, which is beneficial to both the factory and the consumer. Even after full peace, this method of eliminating the middle class, as long as the public is accustomed to it, will not feel inconvenient.</p>
<p>(III) Factory Products Purchased by the Government: Where do the allocated goods come from? One source is confiscated hoarded goods. If the first method can be thoroughly implemented, the quantity of various daily necessities will certainly be considerable. The second source is the factory's products, which are not allowed to be bought and sold privately, but are purchased entirely by the government at a reasonable profit. In this way, speculation using factory orders for trading can be eliminated, and reasonable commodity prices can be adjusted. However, abuses of this method can also arise, that is, the factory can still sell goods privately, resulting in black market prices. Therefore, a monitoring system is needed. The government can instruct the guild to be responsible for supervision or send people to supervise. If there is private sale, the manager and the guild leader should be severely punished.</p>
