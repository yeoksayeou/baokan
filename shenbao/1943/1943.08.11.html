<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">急待倡導的幾件社會福利事業 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>上海租界接收以來，當局正努力準備舉辦一新中外視聽的事業，市民也正期待着新猷展布。遠者大者，輿論已有詳切的獻言，當局也有明確的宣示，今後只待事實的表現。我們今天要提出的，只是社會上急待舉辦的福利事業，如果辦得成功，對於將來本市的市民福利，却有非常重大的裨益。</p>
<p>第一件事，是社會上的喪　習慣之改革。一般市民，狃於舊習，每當人死後，輙舉行無謂的繁禮褥節，消耗去大量金錢與時間，特別是屍體的埋葬，既須衣冠全套，四季完備，殉葬物品，務極豪華，而棺木墳墓，尤須精美，往往富貴之家，所耗數十萬。至於棺木停放之害及公共衛生，墳地浪費之妨及農業生產，對於社會經濟，更屬浪費。即在平時，已常研究改革。在此戰時，國民生活，力求節約，對於棺　舊俗，尤當迅謀改革。攷之近代文明先逃各國，凡人死後，多行火葬，僅以骨灰，葬於公墓，以誌追念。多數大科學家及哲學家，更多預立遺囑，死後以遺體供科學家解剖研究，以為醫學及科學硏究之助。這種犧牲死後軀壳，以益人軍社會的美德，向為大宗敎家大學問家所歌頌讚美，亦為我們今日所常效法。前公共租界工部局原有火葬設備，我們希望當局加以改善擴大，使之平民化，對於貧苦死者，予以免費，移施材費用於火葬需要。並盼社會先進共起倡導。官民協力，改革陋俗，將來成功之後，不僅民問可以節省一筆無謂的消耗，而且纍纍荒塚與遍野墳塲，一變而為農業生產之地，至於國家物資之節約，迷信風氣之改善，更非片言可盡。諺云。。「未能事人，焉能事鬼」，今日我們要為民衆生活而奮鬥，一切關於死屍的消耗，必須完全節約了。</p>
<p>第二件事，是街頭流浪兒童，必須立即肅淸，給以必要的敎養。現在本市街頭，流浪兒童愈見增多，不僅社會觀瞻不佳，而且此輩盈千累萬的兒童前途之淪沒，尤為國家民族無比的損失。前公共租界工部局和前法租界公董局，都有見童保障科之設，專力於馬路流浪兒童，迷路孩童，以及小竊，棄兒，逃亡學徒與婢女等之收容敎養工作，辦理頗著成績。現在市政當局，似乎應該繼承辦理，而且增加其經費，擴充共規模，務求在較短時期內，將本市街頭的流浪兒童，完全獲得正當的去處，一方面使市容整肅淸潔，另一方面，使這些孩子們獲得最低限度的生活，享受兒童應受的國民敎育，學習今後謀生與服務的技能。不過，關於這種流浪兒童的敎養事業之進行，確是今日一大問題。在市政當局，自不便專門為此開設機關，招聘大批管敎人員；而普通慈善機關及學校，亦不適於對此輩流浪兒實施有效的敎養。好在以前兒童保障科，原有此種敎養組織，本市也存在相當的民辦的敎養善團，今後只要擴充改善，便可順利進行。</p>
<p>第三件事，是托兒所之急待普遍創辦。所謂託兒所」，是為使一般男女公民減少對於子女之拖累，俾安心於其事業而設。近世先進各國，託兒所的組織，已極普遍。大都是父母在每晨出發工作之前，將其子女交付於托兒所，至每晚放工時再行領回。子女有托兒所特聘的保姆看護保養，其父母就可安心工作。家庭，社會，與國家，都受其實際利益。也有些托兒所，並長期收養嬰孩，風屬公務人員及勞工的幼年子女，使可長期交托，負責撫育，自哺乳直至幼稚園期滿，而升入小學。此種小孩在托兒所合理化的撫養教育之下，成長起來，在德，智，體，羣各方面，都有正常的發展，其本身之成就，較之在貧苦及富而嬌縱放蕩的家庭所成長者，自屬優秀。我國一切落後，此咱優良制度，尚在萌芽時期，當此一般人民，都在感受生活重壓之時，多數公務人員，教職員的子女，都有無法撫育之苦。嬰兒健康與智育水準之低落，從國家社會前途着想，使人為之不寒而慄！市政當局，如能及明普設托兒所，第一步使中下級公各人員，教職員及勞工子女，得有所托，即至少可望：　行政，敎育及生產效率，因從業員無子女之顧慮而大為增進；　一般家庭婦女，解除了子女的束縛，亦可參加適當的生產工作，可以强化戰時生產效率；　大批幼年兒童，在合理化的撫育敎養下成長起來，可為將來國家社會復興建設及改迭社會的生力軍。</p>
<p>我們認為這三件事，必須立即推動進行。市政當局，須站在指導，扶助與監督的地位，而由對各該事業具有興趣學識與經騐的個人及社團去經辦。特別希望一般宗敎家，佛敎徒，天主敎，基督敎，大家出來，分別主持，因為這種事業，也只有以宗敎家犧牲服務的精神，才能辦理得好；而事業的倡導，行政上的指示，及經濟上的接治，則有待於政府及社會上熱心人士之努力。</p>

<h3 id="c3">田尻公使發表訓話 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>華中之經濟，以上海為中心，而日本對華中之經濟政策，乃在謀國民經濟之復興建設，更造成逐行對英美戰爭之有力兵站基地，易言之，即以謀培養對英美作戰之中日作戰之中日戰力，對英美反擊，予以　滅為目標，此毋庸贅述矣，建　政策決戰對策，此為超越個人利害之偉業，排斥英美式之個人利益，個人享樂，以及所謂猶太式之利殖與金慾，以國民為本位國家為木位，以保衛東亞及謀果亞共榮為目標，此具體方策首須使上海與各地間物資圓滑流通及增强生產，經國府之英斷，業已組成機構，即全國商業統制總會，但運營商統會時，以物資流通，可謂使其形成循環機構，並使其其有價値之血液，而其流通果為如何？機構雖吿成立，而商統會應有之運營，猶感陷於不甚活動之狀態，尤其以最重要物資之妙布，成為投機及囤積之最大對象，一部份投機幫，以承平時代經濟之物價互相比率為基礎，播弄其巧妙議論，企圖抬高一紗布及綿花價格，而此種影響漸以波及共他商品，且使另售業有機可乘，引起一般物價昻騰，漫無止境，苟對此情勢，放任不顧，則阻碍物資生產，　買配給，益　困雖，又使一般人對通貨引起不安，致民生之安定，亦雖祈求，故為達至復與經濟培養戰方之大目標，不得不首先謀取物價對策，而此時數年來上海之紗布存貨，必須加以活用，使其在經濟建設上，發揮其力量，放對國府此次措置，尤應予以諒解，雖然物價對策，並非限於僅僅收買紗布而已，然對紗布之迅予實施，却為要圖，此外必須謀將收買之紗布，以適當價格出售予實需方而，俾安定紗布價格，繼而再謀共他重要物資價格之安定，更宜擴大調查囤積及澈底實行，以與之相輔並進，又必須催收不正常放款，採取維持通貨價値之施策，此數點與收買紗布，同為希望予實施者。其中維持通貨，尤屬重要問題，此次取買紗布，不以鉅額　備劵給付，此表示國府最意之周到，日本望中儲行始　取協力之方針，已為既定事實，由於此次收買時日方所採協力態度而愈益明顯矣。繼收買紗布之後，實施以適當價格圓滑配給及促進一般物資之安定，亦為重大事項，與本施策實施之同時，並期紗布製品以外之各　商品價格趨低，又外問對所謂適當價格頗多種種議論，商人方面，雖每易極向高物價政策，但於世界戰爭中，無論任何國家，均不採取高物價政策，又紗布之收買，決不能使紡結業趨於倒產，並且對原料棉花之　　，為各方面所關懷，關於此點，母須紗布從業者憂心，當局已有實施之準備，又將來對地方之配給，如有投機囤積之魔手伸展至配給紗布，則以嚴　之手段處斷之，上海由學租界收囘，在政治經濟文化等各方面，須有澈底的革新，而其革新根本問題，乃在思想方面，尤其必須經濟思想之革新，上海能否更生，新中國能否建設成功，胥視經濟思想之革新，是否奏效。商統會成立之初，原冀望商民之自治而使其成就，但投機囤積商人，以追隨英美之金錢思想為金科玉律，對商統會運營迭加阻碍，故國府此次對投機囤積商人採取斷然措置。日方對國府之施策，當然予以令面協力，因此日商所有之紗布，亦實施收買，但日方暫時並不使用强制力，希望當事者某於愛國心，率先就範，自動協力，中日關係當局，以斷然之決意與密切之連絡，為完成本施策目的而邁進，而此次收買紗布，以中日亦共同處理之精神而推進，故切望各位紗布從業者，充分認識本施策之重性。　予以協力，以期實施能毫無遺憾云。</p>

<p>廣州十日中央社電　合衆社重慶八日電，承認日軍航空部隊自七月下旬以來，於大陸戰綫所展開之攻勢，乃為防止駐渝美空軍增强實力使其前進基地完全潰滅而實行者。同時並承認日空軍之戰鬥機及轟炸機均極優秀。茲錄該合衆電原文如次：七月二十三日阻碍日美空軍活動已久之惡天氣，復放　朗，日航空部隊當即展開攻勢，　美駐渝空軍前進基地，此次之戰鬥中最偉注意者，厥為美駕駛員報吿參加戰鬥之日機均為最優秀之新銳機，關於此種日機之詳細一切尙未判明。傳其速度等，較過去確極優秀，自此觀之，可知日軍動員新銳機，乃欲防止美空軍增强實力於未然，是日軍決不默視美空軍之加强。</p>

<p>柏林十日中央社電　據海　社軍事記者稱：西四里橋頭堡壘中北段之德義軍，自於上週末將陣經縮短後，正與跟踪而進之英美軍從事激戰，北岸美第七軍左翼所施之壓力大見增加。昨日德軍戰報曾指出敵軍之大舉進犯聖阿迦達（St　Agatr）之一東，美軍出勤堅强之坦克車及步兵，並有軍艦飛機在海空兩方掩護，但北岸及中路敵軍之行動，是否能有重要建樹，現尙不無疑問。現戰事中心，已經由特洛那東移，止於奈勃洛第齊山與埃特那山間之山谷之中·美軍巴頓將軍部下之右翼及加拿大軍，機自北包抄埃特那，經由迦大索實施突破，以抵林倫格洛沙，今能成功　足威脅喀太尼亞以北之德軍陣地，是以在山谷中之軸心軍抵抗殊為激烈。特洛那以南英第入軍左翼之實力加强，蓋係自喀太尼亞抽調而至，該　作戰中心在阿台諾（Aderno）區，軸心軍　行彈性戰　重　瞰軍，喀太尼亞以北沿海之形勢未有變更，英第軍右翼之前鋒僅向城外推進數公里而已。</p>

<h3 id="c16">蘇軍夏季攻勢　分三路進行　人力物力蘇方損失慘重具爾哥洛特區戰事激烈 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>柏林十日中央社電　貝爾哥洛特四區及四南區之戰事，最近益見激烈，範圍亦漸擴大，蘇軍進攻之重心，顯已移至此區。敵軍又由朱古葉夫區進攻，敵軍砲火密集，坦克車亦大舉進攻，德軍應付頗為不易，但實力堅強之後備軍　續　到增援，似有阻正蘇軍推進之希望。蘇軍進攻之第二重心，在奧勒爾迤西之區，勃里昻斯克為敵軍進擊之目標，戰事亦甚激烈，但德軍兵勇着戰，上週末仍能阻止蘇軍之進攻，德軍陣錢完全未被突破。蘇軍推攻之第三重心，在維亞慈瑪迤西一帶，自上週未始，蘇軍開始由維亞慈瑪間四推進。此外蘇軍曾向拉多加湖迤南，唐納資之中部·密烏斯·及庫彭橋頭堡壘等地進攻，但皆係局部之戰事，其動機顯欲分散德軍長官之視綫。總之，此次夏季大戰，仍為重要之物實戰，敵軍步兵數師仍不顧一切犧牲而力戰，但步兵現今已不及坦克車·砲火·及空軍之重要，蘇軍坦克車每日被德軍擊毀者約二百輛，飛機每日損失達一百架，蘇軍坦克車損失之浩大，證實德軍攻已坦克車武器之精良，效力之偉大。最近蘇軍大砲異常猛烈，由此可知蘇聯未盡力發展其工業產量，斯達林顯有命令蘇軍突破德軍東綫之雄圖，至今仍　能加願以償。</p>

<p>我們對於對華新政策的展開，寄以極大的祝福與關心。中國目前正在脫離自雅片戰爭以來買一世紀之久的半殖民地的地位，而逐漸整備自主獨立的體制，於是社會經濟必然地發生全面的改組，民族資本之向生產方面的動員，收購配給機關的合理化，及金融統制等，無論那一種施策，都跟着經濟的變化而來。被稱為半封建的陳舊的經濟基礎與機構，若不加以改革，則不能解決當前的問題—確立自主經濟，增强生產，以安定民生。對於此點，我們深覺因難重重，因而有努力的必要。但中國終究已經着手設立了全國商業統制總會，以發動收購配給的合理化　並在金融方面，集中票據決算於儲備銀行。</p>
<p>這樣，中國經濟的是最適切的捷徑。今後改組，到現在為止，主應百尺竿頭，更進一步要的還是流通部面上的，而移轉其重心於生產間題。從此方而着手，方面。中國當前最切要的是增强生產，安定民生。而要達到這目的，最態注重的自然是農村對策。中國已經着手的農村對策，似乎祗有設立了無錫的農業機具製造所。最近據說以交通銀行為中心組織「農村貸款銀行　」，但尙是紙上計劃。眞正的農村對策，尙有待於今後的推動，記者爰在這裏提倡中日官民應重視此時的合作社運動，並傾注全力加以改組。</p>
<p>華中合作社現狀</p>
<p>中國事變以來，日軍當局為從事治安，宣撫工作起見，發起合作社運　，之後隨着淸鄉工作的進展，非常發達。華中合作社自民國二十七年起開始着手，在二十九年末有五萬戶，三十年末有二十三萬三千戶，三十一年末增至入十萬六千戶，迄最近達百二十萬戶。組織率約當國府統治區域人口的一五％，淸鄉區域約為三五％，而蘚州一帶竟達五力％。這合作社祚最初是安撫人民用物資的配給機關，在今日則經營短期資金的貸放，生活必需品肥料的配給，收買農產物，指導技術等相常廣泛的經濟事業。合作社目前在收購配給方面已植下了穩固的實際勢力。</p>
<p>日方的合作社</p>
<p>但這是所謂「日方的合作社」，初由軍部管轄，自去年四月起移歸大使館，由百二十名日系指導。担任運營，其資金來源仰給於華中農業助成會，由華興商業銀行，日方商社及日方官民　　集者。跟着中日新關係的展開，這合作社亦移交中國方面經營。這是極其當然的措價，但在交替的過渡時期中似乎引起了若干混辭。日系指導員將如何處置，在資金系統的整備上，在收購配給方而，与全國商業統制總會的關係如何，凡此均為當前重要的問題。</p>
<p>日籍指導員的任務</p>
<p>在中國方面，首先必須繼承並發展日方所　勤扶植起來的合作社，而不能不依舊保留日系指導員。運營的主體，當然須在於中國方面今後應活用其實貴的經騐，使之担任經營，技術二方面的指導，不過其地位應略事更動。以前完全由其出面經營，今後則將以顧問的資格担任內部的指導，其次，說到資金系統問題，當然，應漸由日方交替於中國方面，與民族資本相結合。唯那時國民政府必須加以澈底的監督與補助，以免變成高利貸資本的榨取機關。又在收購配給方面，使與商業資本協定各自的分野，給與合作社充分的地位。為了維護農民的利益，那是絕對必要的，合作社在此方面的實際勢力，現此不能加以忽視。所以合作社應賦與全國商業統制總會下層機　的地位，而便利交　物資等的配給。</p>
<p>要之，中國農村對策的重要性此時應更有新的認識，希望關係方面傾其全力以重新組織合作社運動，並加以促進。（翔：　自「東洋經濟新報」第二〇八二號社論）</p>

<p>棉紗　布　政府收買，可謂經濟施　中的一陳甘霖。何謂甘霖？就是大學中的一陳時雨，足使人人　其沛　。</p>
<p>棉紗棉布的强制收贊，的接可以為戰時民衆解決衣的問題，間接可以促使一切其他物價的瀉落。這樣一個緊魚措施，可以使「最近物價　貴，　夢愈演愈熾」的局面，來一個念角度的方向轉變，因為，上海物價的張漲，責以紗布為始作倆者；如今。紗布的囤積投機者，既陷於作　自縛的處堉中、則以其他一切物品為國積投機的對象者，亦皆有兔死狐悲之感·從此可以休矣！</p>
<p>此外·政府所收買的大量紗布，還可以運到其他地區，如滿洲南洋一帶，以作糧食和其他物資的交換。到了各種物世都能夠由此充沛起來，物價不求其平而自平了。</p>
<p>所以，這樣一個急角度方向轉變，足使囤積的物皆，一變而為配給的物資。。軍純性的物資，一變而為分門化的物資；高漲的物價，一變而為低落的物價；不正當投機的邪　，一變而為正當投資的正路其自然的結果，無疑地，當為民生之漸趨安定，經濟之逐步復興。</p>

<p>金融各業市况一致狂跌</p>
<p>國府為調術物價，安定民生起見，對於棉紗棉布實施收買、業經九日最高國防會曦通過，公佈收買棉紗棉布暫行條例及實施要綢，規定所有上海市內現存之棉紗棉布由國府收買，由行政院令飭全國商業統制總會統　辦　，據中央社記者昨向南統會方面探悉，該會對於收買棉紗棉布整個實施方案，進行步驟、已祚硏究擬訂中，日內即可公布發表。</p>
<p>經濟各界擁護　　開於國府實施收買棉紗棉布措置，本市經　各　領</p>
<p>莫不表示　　　護，實為取　囤積安定物價之　底有效政策，　時為戰時體制之下，調節物資之合理方針，蓋過去物資洪應不能平衡。物價日”飛漲，完全受管理之　漫，商民目無法紀，囤積居奇，造成物資恐慌，影響民生，不能安定，且在戰時狀　下·為最大之障碣，此次重要物資棉紗棉布之歸國府收買。統鑄合　之配給，確能澈底肅淸囤積，軍民供需平衡，物價　有合　之準繩，間接可肅淸商民受投　居奇之損害，故全滬各界商民，自常遵守法令，極端擁護國策，共國協力復興正常經濟。</p>
<p>一般金融動態　　最近兩月以來、本市各　市塲均呈蓬勃狂漲之勢，一般　　產業界，鑒於當局調查物資取締囤積之嚴厲</p>
<p>均轉變投機目標，市儈不敢購囤物資，而韓移始赤股票公價等之非法買賣，所有已經　國之物資，則因無法移動脫售，雖有空貶之高價，而無實際交易，昨、（九）日當局公布收買棉紗棉布要綱後，一般擁有大批貨品者，莫不驚惶失措，故十日各業市楊黑市打情，均呈驚人狂跌，棉紗棉布市價　降數中陽之鉅，其他如粭赤跌落兩大關外，股票中有跌至一中關外及三五小關，公債亦一致下跌一小關餘之詎。</p>

<p>國民政府為謀安定物價　進物資交流起見、決實行收買棉紗棉布，業於九日公佈「收買棉紗棉布暫行條例，」並即日實施，友邦日木方面，為協力　府，亦令華中日水貿易聯合會實行收買，因此　日上午十時普，上海各商品行市均因政府之此種斷然措施，而呈空前暴跌，國府政治力量，對上海經濟界之充分發揮其威力，亦由此可見，故今後上海物價之安定，黑市之　淸，及　內地物資交流之同滑等、均將逐漸可以實現。</p>

<p>— 小麟</p>
<p>這該是多麽殘忍的事國　灶披問裏邪個老寡婦的兒子「小陸」，自從被他的娘　薦到××舞廳去　「僕歐」之後，我親眼看他慢慢的向下沉，向下沉……完全變了，我驚駭道環境征服人的力景是那麽的大，才十七歲的孩子啊！</p>
<p>每常我在亭子問黯淡的電燈光之下埋頭寫作時，大概十二點鐘左右吧！弄堂口傳來了術被寂岑的口哨聲，我立刻是習慣地放下　的　桿，靜聽他的脚步聲由遠而近……</p>
<p>「殼脫…效脫…」像一個値夜的巡警似的搬動着他沈重的脚步踱囘來，隨着他的母親便立刻開了灶披間的門迎接他……我望着稿紙微笑一下；今夜地該是倦了？我視福他們有一個甜睡的夜晚，他的母親做手工做得那麽晚，也該足是倦了啊！</p>
<p>「蒲…蒲…蒲…」像一個被監禁了數十年的囚犯一旦釋放後找尋着歸宿似的聲音，口哨也變成深沉的喘氣聲……我知道他准是受了委曲了；舞塲是個甚麼地方啊！生意不好，舞女大班會找舞女及僕歐出氣的，或者甚麼人得罪了舞客也會找到僕歐身上來發洩。</p>
<p>他是受了委曲了進了灶披問，地的一腔寃氣全發洩到他老母身上去了……一會兒孩子已經熱　了，但我聽見有抽　的微聲傳出他的屋子……我　緊地提住筆桿，向漆黑的天空望了一眼。　然的想着……他們　日的幸福，如今是消散了……」</p>
<p>幾天之前吧！口哨傳來了，是那麽輕浮的曲調，脚步聲又是那慶的跟銀蹌蹌時總時斷，時進時退……，不對，這是小陸嗎？那完全是一個醉鬼的聲音喇，我開了窗向底下一望，可怕啊！正是他…一個十七歲的孩子啊！多麽　慘的遭遇，他的環境。我知道早晚　與烟酒一接交上的——舞池喪魍魎的鬼影，朦朧的香烟圈　以迷霧般的簫軍着淡灰的燈光下　浮着　巴黎濃烈剌鼻的香味，肉香，紛香、向每個把　不住意志的靑年人襲擊，「篷尺尺蓬尺尺　　神經的音樂，少女淫蕩的歌聲，水蛇的腰，勾魂的媚眼……追些……這些可怕的魔鬼，我們的年輕的小　又怎能抵抗它听？於是他　要找尋刺激了……不知道是那個　客剩下來的百蘭地，或是舞女吻過的殘杯給他抓到了，飲啊，惡魔興奮地狂呼，今朝有酒今朝醉啊！……</p>
<p>他跌　衝衡，東倒西斜地走到了門口，他母親驚駭地扶他進灶披間，方坐下，他嘔了嘔出了那　贊的水，殘剩的土司白塔……</p>
<p>我聽見他在哭，在笑，在大哭，在大笑……哭！哭這世界的殘酷嗎？笑！笑這世界的醜惡嗎……</p>
<p>啊！我聽見他竟是瘋狂地打着他的母親，那一生有牛世寡居用了二手扶養他長大的慈母呵！我，我忍不住了，立刻急　地走下去踏進他陰暗的灶披間。</p>
<p>「小　！你瘋了嗎？一　拉住了他的手……</p>
<p>一我　了？哈……是你們　了啊！好好酒啊！…女…人…蓬尺…尺尺……</p>
<p>「小　！小陸！你怎麽可以打你的母親呢？」我氣得幾乎要打他了。</p>
<p>嘔……。</p>
<p>「他又喝酒了，又嘔了。孩子、好孩子，你睡下吧！」他的慈母忍住了苦痛反而來勸我了。</p>
<p>「×先生，又吵了你，夜深了，　……」</p>
<p>我只得怏怏地囘房。</p>
<p>睡上了我的床時，已經一十鐘了！遠處　夜點心的聲音在　送過來，底下母親的暗泣與小陸可怕的夢囈聲　伴奏。</p>
<p>漫漫的無邊際的長夜啊！……</p>
<p>已經有幾個夜晚我沒有聽小陸囘家的口哨　與脚步下　了。下午，小陸的母親張着紅腫的老眼告訴我：一小陸他是不要家的了，舞塲裏出來就隨着壞朋友到賭塲裏去，想不到我一個好好的孩子，竟被舞塲害了……唉！」</p>
<p>我想不出用甚麼話來安慰這失去了一生希望所寄託的孩子的老寡婦；</p>
<p>「那麽你趕快叫他不要再去做僕歐好了！</p>
<p>「那不成呀！我們母子的生活如何維持呢？」　　「可以幹別的啊！」</p>
<p>「×先生，這就要怪他父親死得太早了，沒有人能好好地敎育地，使他多這幾年醫，他天性是不　的劇！這也要怪我自己在以前只是一天到晚忙　做手工，既沒有錢供他　資，又不能有閒工夫管敎他……現在別的事他如向能幹呢？再脫又沒有人介紹，×先生，你可有甚麼生意介紹他去嗎？」</p>
<p>「這…老太太，我自己也正失着業呢？……」</p>
<p>無聲地走出她的房問麽…她…正在呆呆地暝想着甚</p>
<p>我們是只能眼看着這個孩子的毀滅了……。</p>
<p>夜我很早就上了　，我怕聽見他的脚步聲，准會帶囘一些哭，笑，嘔，和兒子打着母親的聲音！</p>
<p>但是我失眠了一夜，外面靜悄悄地茲麽聲音也沒有，小陸又沒有囘來，灶披間裏的電燈光也一夜沒有熄滅。</p>
<p>老寡婦在等着他的孩子……。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Several Social Welfare Undertakings Urgently Needed <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai concessions were taken over, the authorities have been working hard to prepare for a new undertaking that will broaden the horizons of both Chinese and foreigners, and the citizens are also looking forward to the unfolding of new initiatives. For those more distant and larger matters, public opinion has already provided detailed suggestions, and the authorities have also made clear pronouncements. From now on, we just have to wait for the facts to speak for themselves. What we want to propose today are the social welfare undertakings that urgently need to be carried out. If they can be done successfully, they will have very significant benefits for the future welfare of the citizens of this city.</p>
<p>The first thing is the reform of funeral customs in society. The general public, adhering to old habits, often holds meaningless and complicated rituals and ceremonies whenever someone dies, consuming a large amount of money and time. In particular, the burial of the corpse requires a complete set of clothing, suitable for all four seasons, and burial objects are extremely luxurious, while coffins and tombs must be exquisite. Often, wealthy families spend hundreds of thousands on these items. The harm of keeping coffins at home, the impact on public health, the waste of land for graves, and the obstruction of agricultural production are even more wasteful for the social economy. Even in normal times, reforms have often been studied. In this time of war, when people's lives are striving for frugality, we should quickly seek to reform old customs related to coffins and funerals. Considering the advanced civilized countries in modern times, after a person dies, cremation is usually performed, and only the ashes are buried in a public cemetery as a memorial. Many great scientists and philosophers even make wills in advance to have their bodies dissected and studied by scientists after death, to aid medical and scientific research. This kind of virtue of sacrificing one's body after death to benefit others and society has always been praised by great religious figures and great scholars, and it is also something we should often emulate today. The former Shanghai Municipal Council had cremation facilities. We hope that the authorities will improve and expand them, making them accessible to the common people and providing free services to the poor who die, using the money saved from coffins for cremation needs. We also hope that social leaders will jointly initiate this. With the cooperation of officials and the people, we can reform bad customs. After success in the future, not only will the people be able to save a sum of unnecessary expenses, but also the countless barren mounds and fields of graves will be transformed into agricultural production land. As for the conservation of national resources and the improvement of superstitious customs, these cannot be fully explained in a few words. As the saying goes, "If you cannot serve the living, how can you serve the ghosts?" Today, we must fight for the lives of the people, and all expenses related to corpses must be completely saved.</p>
<p>The second thing is that street children must be cleared immediately and given the necessary education. Now, the number of street children in this city is increasing. Not only is it bad for social appearances, but also the ruin of the future of these thousands upon thousands of children is an unparalleled loss to the nation. The former Shanghai Municipal Council and the former French Municipal Council both had Child Protection Sections, dedicated to the work of taking in and educating street children, lost children, petty thieves, abandoned children, runaway apprentices, and maids. They achieved remarkable results. Now, the municipal authorities should continue to handle this and increase its funding, expanding its scale, striving to ensure that, within a relatively short period of time, all street children in this city are given proper places to go. On the one hand, this will make the city look cleaner and tidier, and on the other hand, it will ensure that these children obtain the minimum living standards, enjoy the national education that children should receive, and learn the skills to make a living and serve in the future. However, the implementation of this educational undertaking for street children is indeed a major issue today. The municipal authorities should not simply set up special agencies and recruit a large number of educators for this purpose; and ordinary charitable organizations and schools are also not suitable for providing effective education to these street children. Fortunately, the former Child Protection Section already had such educational organizations, and there are also considerable private educational charities in this city. In the future, as long as they are expanded and improved, they can proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>The third thing is the urgent need to establish more nurseries universally. The so-called "nursery" is established to reduce the burden of children for ordinary male and female citizens, so that they can be at ease in their careers. In recent advanced countries, the organization of nurseries has become extremely widespread. Most parents leave their children at the nursery every morning before going to work, and then pick them up again every evening when they get off work. With nannies specially hired by the nursery to take care of and maintain their children, their parents can work with peace of mind. The family, society, and the country all benefit from it in practice. Some nurseries also take in infants for long-term care, especially the young children of civil servants and workers, so that they can be entrusted for a long time and be responsible for raising them, from breastfeeding until the end of kindergarten, and then enter elementary school. Under the rational nurturing and education of this kind of child in the nursery, they grow up with normal development in terms of morality, intelligence, physical fitness, and social skills. Their achievements are better than those who grow up in poor or wealthy, spoiled families. China is lagging behind in everything. This excellent system is still in its infancy. At a time when the general population is feeling the heavy pressure of life, the children of the majority of civil servants and teachers are suffering from the inability to raise them. The decline in the health and intellectual level of infants is chilling when considering the future of the country and society! If the municipal authorities can promptly set up nurseries universally, taking the first step to allow the children of middle and lower-level civil servants, teachers, and workers to have a place to entrust their children, at least it can be hoped that: 1. Administrative, educational, and production efficiency will be greatly improved because employees do not have to worry about their children; 2. The general family women, freed from the constraints of their children, can also participate in appropriate production work, which can strengthen wartime production efficiency; 3. A large number of young children, growing up under rational nurturing and education, can be a new force for the future revival and construction of the country and society.</p>
<p>We believe that these three things must be promoted and carried out immediately. The municipal authorities must stand in the position of guidance, assistance, and supervision, and be managed by individuals and organizations that have interest, knowledge, and experience in these undertakings. In particular, we hope that general religious figures, Buddhists, Catholics, and Christians will come out and preside over them separately, because only with the spirit of sacrifice and service of religious figures can such undertakings be managed well; and the initiation of undertakings, administrative instructions, and economic assistance depend on the efforts of the government and enthusiastic people in the society.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Regarding Measures to Purchase Yarn and Cloth: Japanese Side Holds懇談會, Minister Tajiri Delivers訓詞, Director Okazaki Gives Detailed Instructions <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai - Regarding the implementation of the National Government's purchase of yarn and cloth, the authorities of the Japanese Embassy and Japanese yarn and cloth practitioners held an Economic Policy懇談會 at the embassy office conference room yesterday afternoon. From the embassy side, Minister Tajiri, Director of the Planning Section Masuoka, and from the yarn and cloth practitioners side, Chairman of the China-Japan Cotton Products Federation Honda, Chairman of the Shanghai Japanese Cotton Industry Federation Oyama, Head of the Shanghai Branch of the China-Japan Textile Industry Association Mida, and representatives of 30 other textile and cotton product-related commercial firms attended. In addition, from the army side, Army Minister Nagatsu, Captain of the Military Police Unit Mishita, Lieutenant Colonel Fukuyama, from the navy side, Naval Attaché Oka and Naval Attaché Betsuto, Lieutenant Colonel Fukuchi, and from the Greater East Asia Ministry side, Colonel Tanaka, etc. were present. First, Minister Tajiri delivered訓詞, followed by Director-General Okazaki explaining and giving instructions. In his訓詞, Minister Tajiri first explained the background of the National Government's measures, and then stated that in order to revitalize Shanghai and the new China, it is necessary to reform the economy. Finally, he hoped that Japanese yarn and cloth practitioners would voluntarily cooperate.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Minister Tajiri Delivers訓話 <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>The economy of Central China is centered on Shanghai, and Japan's economic policy towards China is to seek the revival and construction of the national economy, and to create a powerful base of operations for the war against Britain and the United States. In other words, it aims to cultivate the Sino-Japanese combat power against Britain and the United States, and to灭the counterattack of Britain and the United States. There is no need to elaborate on this. Building政决戰 counter-measures, this is a great undertaking that transcends personal interests. It rejects the British and American style of individual interests, personal enjoyment, and the so-called Jewish-style profiting and金慾. It takes the people as the foundation and the country as the木position, with the goal of defending East Asia and seeking the 共榮 of Asia. The first concrete measure is to facilitate the smooth flow of goods between Shanghai and other regions and to increase production. Thanks to the 英断 of the National Government, an organization has been formed, namely the National Commercial Control General Association. However, when operating the Commercial Control Association, the circulation of goods can be said to form a circular mechanism, and make it有價値blood. But what is the circulation? Although the institution was announced, the operation of the Commercial Control Association still feels陷in a state of inactivity. In particular, the most important material妙cloth, has become the biggest target of speculation and hoarding. A group of speculators, based on the price ratio of the peacetime economy, use their ingenious arguments to try to raise the price of纱布 and cotton. This influence is gradually spreading to other commodities, and making另售業 have an opportunity to乘, causing a general price increase, without end. If this situation is allowed to continue, it will hinder the production of goods,買配給, and益困虽. It also makes people generally uneasy about the currency, so the stability of people's livelihoods is虽祈求. Therefore, in order to achieve the great goal of复与经济培养战方, we must first seek物價对策, and at this time, the yarn and cloth inventory in Shanghai for several years must be utilized to exert its strength in economic construction. Therefore, the National Government's measure should be understood. Although物價对策is not limited to just buying yarn and cloth, it is an important plan to implement the purchase of yarn and cloth as soon as possible. In addition, we must seek to sell the purchased yarn and cloth to the actual needs at an appropriate price, so as to stabilize the price of yarn and cloth, and then seek the stability of the price of other important materials. It is also appropriate to expand the investigation of hoarding and thoroughly implement it, in order to complement each other. It is also necessary to urge the collection of abnormal loans and take measures to maintain currency價値. These points are the same as buying yarn and cloth, and are hoped to be implemented. Among them, maintaining currency is an important issue. This purchase of yarn and cloth is not paid with a huge amount備劵. This shows the National Government's most意周到. The Japanese望中儲行has already取 a cooperative approach, which has become a established fact, and is becoming more and more obvious due to the cooperative attitude adopted by the Japanese side during this purchase. Following the purchase of yarn and cloth, the implementation of smooth distribution at appropriate prices and the promotion of stability in general goods are also important matters. At the same time as the implementation of this measure, we expect that the prices of various products other than yarn and cloth will tend to be lower. There are also many kinds of discussions on the so-called appropriate price. Merchants tend to be most prone to高物價 policy. However, in the world war, no country adopts a高物價 policy. In addition, the purchase of yarn and cloth must not cause the spinning industry to tend to倒產, and the原料棉花的,, is a concern of all parties. Regarding this point, yarn and cloth practitioners do not need to worry. The authorities have preparations for implementation. In the future, if the魔hand of speculation and hoarding extends to the distributed yarn and cloth to the local areas, it will be dealt with by嚴. Shanghai's收囘from the 學租界, must have a thorough renovation in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture, and the fundamental issue of its renovation lies in the ideological aspect, especially the economic ideology must be renovated. Whether Shanghai can be新生, whether the new China can be built successfully, depends on whether the renovation of economic ideology is effective. At the beginning of the establishment of the Commercial Control Association, it was originally hoped that the merchants and people would achieve autonomy, but the speculators and hoarders, with the 金錢 thinking of following Britain and the United States as the 金科玉律, repeatedly阻碍 the operation of the Commercial Control Association. Therefore, the National Government has taken decisive measures against speculators and hoarders this time. The Japanese side will of course cooperate with the National Government's measures令. Therefore, the yarn and cloth owned by Japanese merchants will also be purchased. However, the Japanese side will not use coercion for the time being. It is hoped that those concerned will take the lead in愛國心and voluntarily cooperate. The Sino-Japanese relations authorities will advance with decisive determination and close communication to complete the purpose of this measure. And this purchase of yarn and cloth will be promoted in the spirit of common handling between China and Japan. Therefore, it is earnestly hoped that all yarn and cloth practitioners will fully recognize the importance of this measure, cooperate with it, so that the implementation can be without regret.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Matters instructed by Director Okazaki <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese National Government has decided to implement the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth owned by Chinese merchants, in order to suppress物價 in Central China, maintain currency價値, and ensure要物资.

<p>Hankou, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Dispatch Army in Central China announced the comprehensive war results for July on August 10. The combat strength of the 渝共军 was 7,634, the 渝共军 corpses left behind numbered 3,146, and 645 were captured and投順.

At the same time, it also acknowledges that the Japanese air force's fighter planes and bombers are extremely excellent. The original text of the Reuters dispatch is recorded as follows: "On July 23, the bad weather that has long hindered the activities of the U.S. and Japanese air forces放朗, and the Japanese air force immediately launched an offensive. The most noteworthy thing in this battle is that the U.S. pilots reported that the Japanese planes participating in the battle were the best and newest planes. The details of these Japanese planes are not yet clear. It is said that their speed is indeed more excellent than in the past. From this point of view, it can be seen that the Japanese army is mobilizing new and sharp aircraft to prevent the U.S. air force from strengthening its power before it happens.

<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to the military correspondent of the 秺社: The German and Italian troops in the northern section of the Sicilian bridgehead, after shortening their陣經since the end of last weekend, are engaged in fierce battles with the advancing British and American troops. The pressure exerted by the left wing of the U.S. 7th Army on the north shore has greatly increased. Yesterday's German war report pointed out that the enemy's large-scale invasion of one east of St Agata, with strong tanks and infantry deployed by the U.S. troops, and warships and aircraft providing cover from the sea and air. However, whether the actions of the enemy troops on the north shore and in the center can have important achievements is still questionable. The center of the war has already shifted eastward from Trolona,止于the valley between Mount Nebrodiqi and Mount Etna. The right wing of General Patton's troops of the U.S. Army and the Canadian Army, taking the opportunity to bypass Etna from the north, implemented a breakthrough via Qata Su, to抵林伦格洛沙, successfullythreaten the German positions north of Catania, so the resistance of the Axis forces in the valley is particularly fierce. The strength of the left wing of the British第입军 south of Trolona has been strengthened, and it was drawn from Catania. The作戰 center is in the Aderno district. The Axis forces行彈性戰瞰军 重瞰军. The situation along the coast north of Catania has not changed. The vanguard of the right wing of the British第军 has only advanced a few kilometers outside the city.</p>

<p>It is learned that the United States and Abyssinia signed an agreement in Washington yesterday.

<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The fighting in the four districts of Belgorod and the four southern districts has intensified recently, and the area has gradually expanded. The main focus of the Soviet offensive has clearly shifted to this area. The enemy forces are also attacking from the Chuguev area, with intense artillery fire and large-scale tank attacks. It is quite difficult for the German forces to cope, but strong reserve troops are continuing to arrive to reinforce, seemingly offering hope of preventing the Soviet advance. The second main focus of the Soviet offensive is in the area west of Orel, with Bryansk as the target of the enemy's attack. The fighting is also very fierce, but the brave German soldiers were able to stop the Soviet offensive last weekend, and the German front line has not been breached at all. The third main focus of the Soviet offensive is in the area west of Vyazma. Since the end of last week, the Soviet forces have begun to advance from the area around Vyazma. In addition, the Soviet forces have launched offensives south of Lake Ladoga, in the central Donets region, at Mius, and at the Kupiansk bridgehead, but these are all local battles, with the obvious motive of diverting the attention of the German commanders. In summary, this summer battle is still an important material battle. Several divisions of enemy infantry are fighting hard regardless of all sacrifices, but infantry is now less important than tanks, artillery fire, and air power. Approximately two hundred Soviet tanks are destroyed by the German forces every day, and the daily loss of aircraft reaches one hundred. The enormous losses of Soviet tanks prove the excellence of the German anti-tank weapons and their great effectiveness. Recently, the Soviet artillery has been exceptionally fierce, which shows that the Soviet Union has been making every effort to develop its industrial production. Stalin clearly has the ambition to order the Soviet forces to break through the German Eastern Front, but he has not yet been able to achieve his wishes.</p>

<h3 id="e19">Reorganizing the Cooperative Movement <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>We place great hopes and concern on the unfolding of the new policy toward China. China is currently moving away from its century-long status as a semi-colony since the Opium War and gradually preparing an autonomous and independent system. Consequently, the social economy will inevitably undergo a comprehensive reorganization. The mobilization of national capital toward production, the rationalization of purchasing and distribution agencies, and financial controls are all policies that follow economic changes. If the old economic foundations and institutions, which are called semi-feudal, are not reformed, the current problems cannot be solved—establishing an autonomous economy, enhancing production, and stabilizing people's livelihoods. We deeply feel that there are many difficulties in this regard, and therefore it is necessary to make efforts. However, China has finally begun to establish a National Commercial Control Association to launch the rationalization of purchasing and distribution, and in the financial field, to concentrate bill settlements in the Central Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>This is the most appropriate shortcut for the Chinese economy. Future restructuring should build upon the existing foundation and further shift its focus from the distribution aspect to production issues. Starting from this aspect. What China urgently needs now is to enhance production and stabilize people's livelihoods. To achieve this goal, the most important thing to pay attention to is rural policies. The rural policies that China has already started seem to only include the establishment of the Wuxi Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Plant. Recently, it is said that a "Rural Loan Bank" is being organized with the Bank of Communications as the center, but it is still just a plan on paper. True rural policies still need to be promoted in the future. Therefore, the reporter hereby advocates that Chinese and Japanese officials and civilians should pay attention to the cooperative movement at this time and devote all their efforts to reorganize it.</p>
<p>Current Situation of the Central China Cooperative</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the China Incident, the Japanese military authorities launched the cooperative movement for the sake of maintaining public order and carrying out pacification work. Afterwards, it developed very rapidly with the progress of the "cleansing" (or pacification) operations. The Central China Cooperative started in 1938. At the end of 1940, it had 50,000 households, at the end of 1941, it had 233,000 households, and at the end of 1942, it increased to 676,000 households. Recently, it has reached 1.2 million households. The organization rate is about 15% of the population in the areas governed by the National Government, about 35% in the "cleansed" areas, and as high as 50% in the Xuzhou area. Initially, this cooperative was a distribution agency for materials to pacify the people. Today, it operates a wide range of economic activities, such as short-term lending, distribution of daily necessities and fertilizers, purchasing agricultural products, and providing technical guidance. The cooperative has now established a solid practical force in the field of purchasing and distribution.</p>
<p>Japanese Cooperatives</p>
<p>But these are the so-called "Japanese cooperatives." Initially, they were under the jurisdiction of the military department, and since April last year, they have been transferred to the embassy, operated by 120 Japanese instructors. Their funding comes from the Central China Agricultural Promotion Association, raised by the China Development Commercial Bank, Japanese trading companies, and Japanese officials and civilians. With the development of the new Sino-Japanese relationship, these cooperatives are also being handed over to the Chinese side for operation. This is an extremely natural measure, but it seems to have caused some confusion during the transition period. How will the Japanese instructors be handled? How will the funding system be organized? What is the relationship between purchasing and distribution and the National Commercial Control Association? These are all important issues at present.</p>
<p>The Mission of Japanese Instructors</p>
<p>On the Chinese side, it is first necessary to inherit and develop the cooperatives that the Japanese side has diligently fostered, and it is necessary to retain the Japanese instructors. The main body of operation must, of course, be on the Chinese side. In the future, they should make use of their valuable experience to take on the guidance of operation and technology, but their position should be slightly changed. Previously, they were completely responsible for operation, but in the future, they will serve as consultants to provide internal guidance. Secondly, regarding the funding system, of course, it should gradually be transferred from the Japanese side to the Chinese side and combined with national capital. However, at that time, the National Government must carry out thorough supervision and subsidies to prevent it from becoming an exploitative machine of usurious capital. Furthermore, in the area of purchasing and distribution, an agreement should be reached with commercial capital to divide their respective fields, giving the cooperatives a sufficient position. This is absolutely necessary to protect the interests of farmers. Therefore, the cooperatives should be given the status of a lower-level agency under the National Commercial Control Association to facilitate the distribution of goods and materials.</p>
<p>In short, the importance of China's rural policies should be newly recognized at this time. It is hoped that relevant parties will devote all their efforts to reorganize the cooperative movement and promote it. (Xiang: From the editorial of "Toyo Keizai Shinpo" No. 2082)</p>

<p>The local Anti-Tuberculosis Association has recently seen a surge in patients, and its existing hospital is no longer sufficient. Therefore, it has established the Anti-Tuberculosis Association Second Hospital on Hongkou Road near Clark Road to accommodate lung patients. It has also opened the first clinic on July 1st, located at 26 Chihbang Road. The Second Hospital has a good environment. The site was originally the Municipal Council's fourth precinct, covering about 20 mu of land. Last year, the Anti-Tuberculosis Association purchased it from the Municipal Council and began converting it into an anti-tuberculosis hospital. It contains over 40 sickbeds, divided into first, second, third, and free classes.</p>

<p>Sheng Bingji Department Store on Fei Road announces that a customer lost a diamond ring on an afternoon in September of last year. That evening, employee Zhou Houming found it in the dust and handed it over to the store for safekeeping, awaiting its owner. However, after a year, the owner has not claimed it, so the diamond ring has been handed over to this newspaper for public notice. It is hoped that the owner, upon recognizing the item, will voluntarily donate an amount to be used for small loans. If no one claims it within a week, the ring will be sold at market value, as per the store's intention, and the proceeds will be used for small loans, benefiting the owner. The store is fair, honest, enthusiastic in public service, benevolent, and truly a model for department stores.</p>

<p>Nanshi Residents Register for Anti-Smoking: Since the Shanghai Local Anti-Smoking Bureau began processing the registration of smokers, it established an office in the Nanshi Qingzhen Street to process resident smoker registration. In recent days, many Nanshi residents have gone to register and obtain applications. After the smoker registration period expires, officials will be sent to various anti-smoking centers to inspect the smoker registration certificates. This will allow a gradual reduction in the smoking volume of smokers and an early completion of the eradication of accumulated smoking habits.</p>

<h3 id="e37">Consumer Cooperative for Teachers and Staff <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The Xin Zhongguo Bao (New China Daily) of the 8th carried an article by Mr. Jiang Shouting entitled "A Humble Proposal for Establishing a Consumer Cooperative for Teachers and Staff in Shanghai." It proposed that teachers and staff throughout the city voluntarily pool their resources to establish a cooperative to reduce consumption burdens. In recent years, the comparison between the increase rate of price indices and the income of teachers and staff has been like a centipede racing a snail. The latter is far behind, and the burden of life is suffocating. However, their responsibility is to cultivate the most fundamental source of national rejuvenation.</p>
<p>Although the lives of teachers and staff are currently valued by the government and sympathized with by society, it is still impossible to guarantee them. If Mr. Jiang's proposal can be implemented, it would be a good method that lies between increasing income and reducing expenditure, worthy of the collective efforts of teachers and staff. Here, I offer a few humble suggestions.</p>
<p>Although the cooperative is organized by teachers and staff themselves, the education authorities, all sectors of society, especially wealthy students' parents, should express their utmost sympathy and provide economic loans or supply goods at fair prices, because with high prices, the shares of the cooperative members will definitely not be able to support operations.</p>
<p>In the future, with more members, the distribution of goods will be cumbersome. It seems appropriate to make each school a unit, with the main cooperative distributing to these units, who will then redistribute. It is hoped that the school authorities will take on the responsibility of collecting and distributing goods from the main cooperative on time, fulfilling their obligations and providing preferential treatment to the teachers and staff of the school. This can reduce the labor and transportation costs of the main cooperative and directly increase the benefits for the members.</p>
<p>The site of the cooperative should be provided free of charge or with minimal rent by a larger school, and the staff should be borrowed as much as possible to minimize administrative costs.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Municipal Education Association Raises Poverty Alleviation Fund <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Association believes that with the return of the two concessions in this city, educational work urgently needs to be developed. In view of the large number of out-of-school children and the high dropout rate, the future is worrying. Therefore, at the fourth committee meeting of the association, it was proposed to raise a poverty alleviation fund to provide relief. The proposal was approved immediately and passed at the fifth committee meeting. One hundred fundraising committee members were hired to carry out the work. It has been learned that the donation books have been printed and distributed to the fundraising committee members, urging them to benefit poor students and jointly support this righteous cause.</p>
<h3 id="e39">The Charity Basketball Game for the Sports Emergency Relief Fund, Act II, Continues with Zhongbei's Victory Over Paramount Last Night <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>In the emergency relief charity basketball tournament, the game between Zhongbei and Paramount continued for the second time last night at the Zhongqing Gymnasium, with a lively atmosphere. Under the opening ball of Lin Kanghou, the drama troupe of the Interlude Union showed off their polished acting skills, taking the lead in each quarter and defeating Zhongzhu with a score of 35-28. In the first half, the drama troupe also took the lead with a score of 23-15. As the main game began, the atmosphere became even more tense. Paramount, due to the absence of their main players Chen Xianghua, Kong Guangyi, and Lu Zhong'en, looked inferior compared to Zhongbei, whose players grew stronger with each battle. At the same time, Feng Nianhua's old arm injury relapsed after the fierce battle in the preliminary round, leading to another disastrous defeat with a score of 19-53. During the half-time, a racket was auctioned off and purchased by the great philanthropist Zhongguan Lechang for 15,000 yuan.

<h3 id="e42">Commentary: A Sharp Turn in the Economic Sphere <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The government's purchase of cotton yarn and cloth can be described as a timely rain in economic policy. What is a timely rain? It is a welcome rain in the midst of a drought, enough to benefit everyone.</p>
<p>The mandatory purchase of cotton yarn and cloth can directly solve the clothing problem for the people during wartime and indirectly promote the decline of all other prices. Such an urgent measure can bring about a sharp turn in the "recent price increases, and the increasingly fierce speculative frenzy," because the Shanghai price increases are initiated by yarn and cloth. Now, those who hoard and speculate on yarn and cloth are trapped in a self-imposed bind, and those who speculate on other goods as hoarding targets also have a sense of "the rabbit is dead, the fox mourns." From then on, they can rest.</p>
<p>In addition, the large amount of yarn and cloth purchased by the government can also be transported to other areas, such as Manchuria and Southeast Asia, in exchange for grain and other materials. When various materials can thus become abundant, prices will naturally stabilize without seeking to do so.</p>
<p>Therefore, such a sharp turn can transform stockpiled goods into allocated materials, military resources into specialized materials, rising prices into falling prices, and improper speculation into proper investment. The natural result will undoubtedly be the gradual stabilization of people's livelihoods and the progressive recovery of the economy.</p>
<h3 id="e43">The National Government Implements the Purchase of Yarn and Cloth; All Sectors of the Economy Support It <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Financial Sectors See Uniform and Drastic Declines</p>
<p>In order to regulate prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, the National Government has implemented the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth. The Supreme National Defense Council approved the "Provisional Regulations for the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth" on the 9th, stipulating that all existing cotton yarn and cloth in Shanghai will be purchased by the National Government. The Executive Yuan ordered the National Commercial Control Council to uniformly handle the matter. According to the Central News Agency reporter's inquiry with the Southern Control Council, the council is researching and drafting the entire implementation plan and steps for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, which will be announced and published in the coming days.</p>
<p>All Sectors of the Economy Support It: Regarding the National Government's implementation of the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, leaders from all sectors of the economy in the city have expressed their support. This is considered a thorough and effective policy for curbing hoarding and stabilizing prices, as well as a rational approach to regulating materials under the wartime system. In the past, the imbalance of material supply and the daily soaring prices were completely due to the unbridled management, the merchants' disregard for the law, and the hoarding of goods, creating material panic and affecting the people's livelihood and stability, which posed a major obstacle in the wartime situation. This time, the purchase of important materials, cotton yarn and cloth, by the National Government and the unified allocation can thoroughly eliminate hoarding, balance the supply and demand of the military and the people, and provide a fair benchmark for prices. It can indirectly eliminate the damage caused by speculators. Therefore, all merchants and residents in Shanghai will abide by the laws, strongly support the national policy, and work together to revive the normal economy.</p>
<p>General Financial Trends: In the past two months, all markets in the city have shown a vigorous and frenzied upward trend. Generally, the industrial sector, given the authorities' strict investigation of materials and crackdown on hoarding, have shifted their speculative targets. The merchants dare not hoard materials and have turned to illegal trading in stocks and public debt. All the materials that have already entered the country cannot be moved or sold, so although there are empty promises of high prices, there is no actual transaction. Yesterday (9th), after the authorities announced the outline for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, those with large quantities of goods were panicked. Therefore, the black market in various industries saw a shocking plunge on the 10th. The market price of cotton yarn and cloth fell sharply by several middle and lower positions. Other prices, such as the price of rice, fell by two major passes. Stock prices fell by one medium pass and three to five small passes, and public bonds also uniformly fell by one small pass.</p>
<h3 id="e44">After the Implementation of Cotton Yarn and Cloth Purchases, Shanghai Prices Tend to Fall <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>In order to stabilize prices and promote the exchange of materials, the National Government decided to implement the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, and promulgated the "Provisional Regulations for the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth" on the 9th, which was immediately implemented. The Japanese side also ordered the Japanese-Chinese Trade Federation in Central China to implement the purchase. Therefore, at 10 am on the morning of the 10th, all commodity markets in Shanghai showed an unprecedented sharp decline due to this decisive measure by the government. The full exercise of the National Government's political power over Shanghai's economy can be seen from this, so the stability of Shanghai's prices, the elimination of the black market, and the smooth flow of materials in the interior will all be gradually realized in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Various Banks in the City Refuse to Provide Mortgage Loans <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>In order to assist the authorities in cracking down on hoarding and guiding floating capital into normal uses, various money houses and banks in the city have unanimously refused to provide mortgage loans. Anyone holding warehouse receipts for goods will not be accepted for mortgage loans. For loans already made, they will be urged to be repaid. Interbank lending has been tightened by the Central Bank and the United Bankers Association. At the same time, various banks are promoting savings campaigns and increasing savings interest rates. Loans for increasing production and construction businesses, after being verified, will be granted as much as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Stock Market Trends <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks initially experienced a general and sudden plunge. Around noon, investment firms rallied them upward. However, overall sentiment remained nervous, primarily due to the government's fixed-price purchasing of yarn and cloth. Under the strain of tight credit, rumors circulated that all export goods would be subject to unified control. The subsequent surge on July 8th was not unexpected, with prices rising anywhere from one to four times. Trading volume saw a significant increase. A few money shops found it difficult to balance their positions, and firms were unwilling to deal with those they didn't know well. The textile industry was the hardest hit, with Wing On Textiles once plummeting to under 1,500, before rebounding slightly, ultimately closing down over a hundred points.  Sino-British Cotton Mill, Jen Feng, New Feng, National Glory, Friendliness, Hong Sheng, Great China, and other Tianlun and Lunhua stocks also closed lower, ranging from ten to twenty percent below Saturday's prices. In the department store sector, Wing On Company took a major hit, falling by over a hundred points and breaking the 600 mark before rebounding slightly, though still closing significantly lower. Sincere and China National Goods Company each dropped by several dozen points. China Underwear fell to 100. Jingfu Shirt suffered losses, and Jinglun also saw a significant decline. Lane Crawford, however, remained above the 50-point mark. Although New China and New Asia also fell considerably, they stabilized around 100 yuan, with significant buy orders supporting them within the customs area. Five Continents and Sin Yi reported flat performance. Culture, Yue Yongxiang Printing's rights trading saw a solo price increase on its second day, exceeding 75% of face value. Commercial Press fell another 50 points, China Publishing was hovering near the major mark. The World Book Company also reported declines. Jinfeng Paper was flat. Standard Paper Products saw active trading ex-rights, with prices ranging between 40% and 50% higher. In the public utilities sector, Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity and China General Edison each fell by several dozen points. Public Utility Motor continued to drift, but Shanghai Power Company remained stable amidst trading. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco and Great China Match continued to consolidate at lower levels. Industrial stocks such as Jiu An, Xinghua, and Great China all saw declines. New Asia Construction fell several yuan. China Investment and China Overseas Investment also came under selling pressure. New Benefit Land and Development also declined. Standard Monosodium Glutamate, Fumin Dairy, and G.M.C. Foods all looked weak. Kang Yuan Confectionery gained some positive information, though its gain was still small. China Xingye Timber, Great China Animal Husbandry, China Clock Factory, and Shanghai Tricycle all reported weakness.  Hsiang Sheng Motors continued its upward trend and remained stable.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Market Summary <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Gold and Silver: Yesterday, the gold and silver shops in the city saw old jewelry, as well as other items remaining unchanged. There was no market activity for the industry, and prices first plunged before rebounding, with investor sentiment uncertain. Opening outside the 900-mark in the morning, it fell slightly to 850, before rising again to 940 in the afternoon. The result was a decline of half a point. Jewelry and pure silver were each below the 900-mark.</p>
<p>Official Prices: Unified official prices continued to decline in the black market. Grades A, B, and E all fell to the 200-mark, while Grade C hovered around 240, with sluggish trading.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities: Investor sentiment was extremely weak. There were rumors of rationed distribution, and stocks within warehouses could not be retrieved. Those with inventories were extremely panicked and were attempting to sell. However, because there were few buyers, there was a phenomenon of sales with no market. The trend for soap and candles was the same. Only the cigarette market remained strong, with British-American Tobacco brands like 'Da San Da', and 'Si Da Guan' selling for over 4000 yuan, and 'Fairy' and 'Five Flowers' both starting at over 2000 yuan.</p>
<p>Grains: Yesterday, prices generally fell due to the disappearance of hoarders, reduced demand, and loose selling by traders. As a result, oil, rice, beans, and bean cakes all declined.</p>
<p>Rayon &amp; Yarn: After the imposition of fixed-price purchasing of yarn and cloth, the rayon black market was also severely affected. Buyers were restrained, and the market showed supply without demand. Although prices had fallen close to 5000 yuan, there were few buyers to be found.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Brief News <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Franco-Chinese Pharmacy: At an extraordinary general meeting held on July 26th of this year, a resolution was passed to increase the total capital to 45 million yuan. The method for increasing capital is that each old share is entitled to subscribe for half a new share and may subscribe for one new share at a premium price. This capital increase will be used to establish a subsidiary company named China Xingye Co., Ltd. Its business scope will include: 1. Planning and economics of production undertakings; 2. Investment and operation of industrial, commercial, agricultural, mining and other industries; 3. Investment in transportation, warehousing, and real estate. In the future, Franco-Chinese Pharmacy will use the organization of China Xingye as its outer defense, while China Xingye will use the established businesses of Franco-Chinese Pharmacy as its model. This capital increase has been completed as scheduled.</p>
<p>Following the announcement of the closure of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, there have been fluctuations in other newly established banks. The Financial Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank has dispatched personnel to investigate the reasons for the closure of Zhejiang Industrial Bank. It is reported that the collapse of this speculative bank will not affect normal financial operations.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce usually convenes a meeting of member representatives once every year in June or July. This year, most of the industry associations have been reorganized according to the orders of the responsible officials, and some new associations have also been established, resulting in many changes in the membership list of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. Therefore, the date of the meeting has been postponed. It is now reported that the Chamber of Commerce has completed the registration procedures for the associations and will convene a meeting of member representatives within mid-month.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Essential Points of the Yarn and Cloth Purchase Plan <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>In recent months, the price index in various regions has shown an upward trend, which not only affects the lives of the general public but also hinders the implementation of national policies. The fundamental reason for this is speculation by hoarders. The central authorities, recognizing the impact of this phenomenon and its significance, passed the Yarn and Cloth Purchase Plan at the National Defense Council's temporary meeting on the 9th. This plan is of great significance for improving the lives of the people and establishing a wartime system. Since China's participation in the Greater East Asia War, the entire country has been exerting its full efforts to ensure the success of the war. However, some profit-seeking individuals have used speculative hoarding to seek exorbitant profits, causing prices to soar over the past year and the people's livelihoods to suffer. The government, in order to thoroughly rectify this situation, has passed this plan. It is expected that after the plan is implemented, the clarification of hoarding behavior will lead to a reasonable resolution of the price problem. Further improvements in people's livelihoods, economic recovery, and the enhancement of overall war power will also become more concrete as a result. Currently, the purchase locations are limited to Shanghai. The purchase targets are limited to yarn and cloth. However, since the government is determined to crack down on hoarding, and as merchants in other areas are not yet aware that they need to restrain themselves, the purchase area will not be limited to Shanghai. The types of goods included will also be expanded to include anything that can be hoarded. Therefore, it can be asserted that the stabilization of the national financial and textile markets and the clarification of speculative behavior will begin with this.</p>

<h3 id="e51">The Ruin of a Child <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Lin</p>
<p>This is such a cruel thing. Little Lu, the son of that old widow in the kitchen, since being recommended by his mother to be a "waiter" at the ×× dance hall, I have watched him slowly sink, sink... Completely changed. I was shocked at how great the power of the environment is to conquer people. He's only seventeen years old!</p>
<p>Often, when I'm hunched over writing under the dim electric light in the alcove, around twelve o'clock, I hear a melancholy whistle from the mouth of the alley. I immediately habitually put down my pen and quietly listen to his footsteps getting closer...</p>
<p>"Kutuo... Kutuo..." Like a night watchman, he moves his heavy steps back. His mother immediately opens the kitchen door to greet him... I smile at the manuscript paper; he must be tired tonight? I wish them a sweet night's sleep. His mother works so late making handicrafts; she must be tired too!</p>
<p>"Puu... Puu... Puu..." Like a prisoner who has been locked up for decades and is released and looking for a home, the whistle turns into deep panting... I know he must have been wronged. What kind of place is a dance hall? If business is bad, the dance hall manager will vent their anger on the dancers and waiters, or someone will offend a customer and vent it on the waiter.</p>
<p>He has been wronged. Once he enters the kitchen, all his grievances are vented on his old mother... After a while, the child has gotten angry, but I hear the faint sound of sobbing coming from his room... I tightly grip my pen and look at the dark sky. Suddenly, I think... Their past happiness has now dissipated...</p>
<p>A few days ago, the whistle came, it was such a frivolous tune, and the footsteps were light and clinking, sometimes stopping, sometimes advancing, sometimes retreating... Something's wrong, is this Little Lu? It's completely the sound of a drunkard! I open the window and look down. It's terrible! It's him... A seventeen-year-old child! What a tragic experience. His environment. I knew he would come into contact with alcohol and tobacco sooner or later - the ghostly shadows of the dance floor, the hazy cigarette smoke encircling the dim light, floating with the strong and pungent aroma of Paris perfume, flesh, perfume, attacking every young person who can't hold onto their will. "Peng Chi Chi Peng Chi Chi..." The stimulating music, the lewd singing of the girls, the serpentine waists, the soul-snatching flirtatious eyes... These... These terrible demons, how can our young Little Lu resist them? So he wants to seek stimulation... I don't know if he grabbed some brandy left over by a customer, or a half-empty glass kissed by a dancer, and drank it. Ah, the devil cries out excitedly, let's be drunk while we have wine today!</p>
<p>He stumbled, walking crookedly to the door. His mother was shocked and helped him into the kitchen. As soon as he sat down, he vomited out that sour water, the remaining toast...</p>
<p>I heard him crying, laughing, crying loudly, laughing loudly... Crying! Crying about the cruelty of this world? Laughing! Laughing about the ugliness of this world...</p>
<p>Ah! I heard him hitting his mother madly, that kind mother who had been widowed for her entire life and used her hands to raise him. I, I couldn't bear it anymore, so I immediately went downstairs and stepped into his dark kitchen.</p>
<p>"Little Lu! Are you crazy?" I quickly grabbed his hand...</p>
<p>Am I crazy? Ha... You all are crazy! Good wine!... Woman... Peng Chi... Chi Chi..."</p>
<p>"Little Lu! How can you hit your mother?" I was so angry that I almost hit him.</p>
<p>Vomit...</p>
<p>"He drank again, and he vomited again. Child, good child, go to sleep!" His kind mother endured the pain and tried to persuade me instead.</p>
<p>"Mr. ×, I've disturbed you again. It's late, go back and rest..."</p>
<p>I had no choice but to return to my room reluctantly.</p>
<p>It was already eleven o'clock when I got into bed! In the distance, the sound of someone selling late-night snacks was carried over, accompanied by the mother's quiet sobs and Little Lu's terrible sleep-talking.</p>
<p>Oh, the long, endless night!...</p>
<p>For several nights, I haven't heard Little Lu's whistling and footsteps when he comes home. In the afternoon, Little Lu's mother told me with red and swollen old eyes: "Little Lu doesn't want to come home anymore. After leaving the dance hall, he goes to gambling dens with bad friends. I never thought that my good child would be ruined by the dance hall... Alas!"</p>
<p>I couldn't think of any words to comfort the old widow who had lost the child she had placed all her hopes on.</p>
<p>"Then you quickly tell him not to be a waiter anymore!"</p>
<p>"That won't work! How can we maintain our livelihood?"</p>
<p>"He can do something else!"</p>
<p>"Mr. ×, it's all because his father died too early. There was no one to educate him properly, so he only had a few years of schooling. His nature isn't bad! It's also because I was always busy doing handicrafts and didn't have the money to send him to school or the time to discipline him... Now, what else can he do? And no one will introduce him to anything. Mr. ×, do you have any business to recommend him to?"</p>
<p>"This... Old lady, I'm unemployed myself!..."</p>
<p>Silently, I walked out of her room... She... Was blankly thinking...</p>
<p>We can only watch this child's ruin...</p>
<p>I went to bed very early at night. I was afraid to hear his footsteps, which would surely bring back crying, laughing, vomiting, and the sound of a son beating his mother!</p>
<p>But I suffered from insomnia all night. It was quiet outside, with no sound. Little Lu didn't come back, and the electric light in the kitchen didn't go out all night.</p>
<p>The old widow is waiting for her child...</p>

<p>— Wen</p>
<p>The sky is bright with stars, a gentle breeze blows, the soft laughter of people enjoying the cool air along the road, treading a brisk pace, along the locust trees on the road, I walk towards the unknown.</p>
<p>All sounds cease, the surroundings are quiet, the darkness is like a courtyard garden, in the quietness and without...</p>
<p>Silently, lovers interlock their hearts!</p>
<p>Thus, I begin to dream a hazy and distant dream,</p>
<p>In the dream, I am immersed in a happy atmosphere,</p>
<p>Forgetting all the troubles in the world...</p>
<p>To...</p>
<p>From the hands of the postman, you once brought me the bittersweet aftertaste and fleeting sorrow... In the fields of July, the rice stalks should be growing tall?</p>
<p>I am thinking of you! Could you be gazing north from between the fields; The summer wind has swept across the fields of Jiangnan, when it passes your courtyard, has it told you that your old friend is safe and sound!</p>
<h3 id="e53">When the Storm Comes <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Ping Qing</p>
<p>The piercing cold wind howls as the swirling snow covers the earth; this is a frigid winter.</p>
<p>The magnolia tree hides inside the warm glass greenhouse, glancing down at the small grasses on the ground outside the greenhouse, sneeringly laughing and saying, "You're just a lowly thing after all! Look at me!" So, the magnolia tree arrogantly stretches its branches and waist.</p>
<p>The small grasses shrink their bodies, silently not saying a word.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, it's already spring. The spring wind awakens the creatures of the earth; the sunlight shines on everything.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the gardener also opens the skylight of the glass greenhouse, letting the magnolia tree receive some sunlight. The magnolia is already beautifully carrying buds.</p>
<p>The small grasses raise their heads proudly, silently not saying a word.</p>
<p>Summer, the scorching sun is like a fire, baking the world as if it were on a stove.</p>
<p>The gardener uses things to shade the sunlight from the glass greenhouse. The magnolia tree feels very cool, and the magnolia releases its fragrant aroma.</p>
<p>The small grasses grit their teeth, silently not saying a word.</p>
<p>One day, suddenly, a fierce storm comes.</p>
<p>The glass greenhouse is tilted by the gale, and the glass is shattered into pieces. The magnolia's waist is broken. The flowers are scattered all over the ground, only painfully crying.</p>
<p>The small grasses prostrate their bodies on the ground, silently not saying a word.</p>
<p>The gardener becomes angry; what's the use of a broken magnolia tree? He simply chops the magnolia tree into sections and sends it into the kitchen stove as firewood.</p>
<p>The storm is over.</p>
<p>The glass greenhouse is crooked, and the magnolia tree has already turned to ashes.</p>
<p>The small grasses shake off the water from their bodies, still silently not saying a word.</p>
