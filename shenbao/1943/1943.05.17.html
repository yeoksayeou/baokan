<p>社評</p>
<h3>爲華北災民請命</h3>
<p>「省連年農產歉收，去歲尤甚，茲値靑黃不接之時，草根樹皮，掘削殆盡，仰山投環，時有所聞。昨赴東臨道屬視察，地同沙漠，水草不生，目睹慘狀，五內如焚。各地電告慘情，大致相同。」這是本月十日報載山東唐省長籲請急賑的電文。</p>
<p>「查北方今歲災况慘重，民不聊生。米糠麩皮皆爲飢民續命之寳。」這是本月十日報載華北實業總署督辦王蔭泰報告山東河南等省災况中的說明。</p>
<p>「吃喝不厭的珍饌佳釀，聽看不膩的音樂歌舞，遊覽不倦的花園舞池。」這是本月十五日本埠報載某大酒樓的廣告中的文句。</p>
<p>讀者對照了這幾段文字之後，會發生甚麼感想呢？山東河南各地，和上海同爲中國的土地，北方人民與上海人民，都是中華民國的同胞；然而，爲甚麼北方人一草根樹皮，掘削殆盡，」而上海還有「吃喝不厭的珍饌佳釀」呢？在上海「吃喝不厭」，「聽看不膩」，「遊覽不倦」的人們，應不應該稍稍關心到我們北方苦難中的同胞們呢？我們深信，每一位讀者，都會回答，這是「天經地義」，十分「應當」的！不要說魯豫等省的災民，無不是我們同胞，就是外國人，我們也應該繼承我們古聖先賢「人溺已溺，人飢已飢一的敎訓，「胞與爲懷」的精神，盡力捐助的。</p>
<p>據報章的消息，目前政府對於華北各省的空前災情，非常關懷，社會福利部已經準備救濟。我們所望於主持機關者，是在「救災如救火」的前提之下，趕快而且切實的進行救濟工作，一面使災民得食，一面防止疫癘，進一步推行積極的辦法，使流離的災民，各得安身就業之所，使災區不致擴大，使災况日趨减輕，而接近災區地方的政府及有關機關，更應盡力設法收容難民，作有組織有計劃的安揷，救濟，與就業的指導。當然，我們更盼望專家們努力籌謀防止天災的辦法，與政府協力，以防將來的災害。</p>
<p>但是，最急要的，是目前華北豫魯各省廣大災區中數百萬災民的急賑問題，這個問題如果不立即努力共謀解決，受影響的不祗華北，同時不免影響到其他地區。而問題的解決，更不能單靠政府機關，特別是要全國各地人民之急起救濟。現在旅居京滬各地華北同鄉及在野名流，業已商陳社會福利部，自動組織華北急賑會，協助政府辦理籌振及救濟事宜。我們深覺這是最値得積極推動的義舉。不過，華北以外各省同胞，特別是我們上海各界，更應該見義勇爲，爲各地倡。過去全國性的救災事業，上海的慈善團體，各慈善家，各社會領袖，都是站在領導地位。都曾留下光榮的紀錄。當此華北空前鉅災之時，更應該挺身出來，共同協力，分工合作，進行籌募捐款的工作，以補政府力量所不及，以申同胞互助的大義。我們更建議：（一）南京的華北同鄉與團體，應同上海的華北同鄉與團體，取得聯絡，一致進行。（二）上海的華北同鄉團體，應與上海各慈善團體，各市民福利團體，取得聯絡，共商進行。（三）政府主管機關如社會福利部，應與上海市政府，共同領導策進。宣傳，勸募，集款等，均商決一致辦法，以收迅捷之效。</p>
<p>急賑華北災民，最重要的是要求上海市民的自動捐助，現在上海的經濟情况，也許不此從前，但與全國其他各地比較起來，仍不失爲最富裕之區。以上海市民四百萬人計，至少有一百萬人具有月捐十元的能力，那麼，每月一千萬元，應該是最低限度的目標。而實際上力能月捐一千或一萬以上的殷富，還是很多的，我們深信今日的富人，大部份是深明大義，不待勸請，就會自動大量捐助的。本報同人，雖然境遇艱難，也勉强湊集了五千元，稍盡國民義務，並率先倡導。同時，我們願意代收各界捐助華北災民的款項。竭誠盼望讀者發揮同情與惻隱之心，踴躍輸將，將來集數彙交主辦團體。</p>
<p>同時，我們竭誠希望各界領袖與慈善團體，有計劃的進行勸募運動，務求在最短期內，達到一千萬元的最低目標。除了各界自動捐款之外，我們希望各大酒樓，各大餐館，各大遊藝塲，各以一日或數日的利潤的全部或一部，自動的捐助出來。此外，如各商界的義賣，足球義賽，賽馬義賑等，我們也期望各界共同協力。</p>
<p>總之，目前華北災民盈野，每日死亡，以百千計，我們上海市民，誠能人人稍節食用，則不用說一千萬，即更大的數目，也不是難事。而且關於上海同胞的大義，必可激發全國的人心，那麼，同胞互助的效力，必可早日消除災况。對於未來國運，必有極大的意義！</p>

<h3>太行山戰區擴大　日軍向石太綫進攻　峻極關附近包圍綱完成對深山中共軍猛施攻擊</h3>
<p>山西十六日中央社電　日軍各精銳部隊自此次展開太行山作戰後，已屢次發揮驚人之威力，未出旬日，即紛碎渝軍，繼復轉鋒圍攻共軍第十八集團軍司令部及劉伯承所部一百廿九師　幷攻克麻田鎭，陟縣等共軍根據地，茲更兜剿匿跡於峻極關北方叢山中之共軍，完成巧妙之包圍網，猛攻痛擊，現地日軍當局幷於本日正午發表談話謂，日軍刻已擴大太行山作戰區域，於十五日起，開始進攻石太綫以南地區之共軍。</p>
<p>山西十六日中央社電　日軍各精銳部隊於十五日已在太行山脈峻險地帶完成對共軍抗日陣營之包圍後，即開始覆滅共軍組織，刻正逐漸壓縮包圍圈。迄十六日正午止，戰况如次：自陟縣附近北進之日軍各部隊，已於十三日進抵峻極關附近，將該地區一帶渝共軍悉數粉碎，迄十五日止，渝共軍遺屍廿二具，被俘十二人，日軍截獲步槍十七枝，子彈二百十二發，手槍四技，手溜彈十顆，刺刀卅柄，其後復繼續進擊。又自北方進攻之日軍部隊，亦與此相呼應，於十四日下午在昔陽東南擊潰渝第百二十九團所部平漢游擊隊之一部，又於其東方十五公里之塲江特擊續渝軍約百人，俘據廿五人，截獲小槍九枝，子彈百五十發，軍馬廿匹後，繼續南下。又日軍某部隊並分成東西兩路，到處擊潰敗走中之渝軍。同時日軍各部隊及中國剿共軍繼續在黎城，幡龍鎭，洪水鎭附近展開肅淸戰，自十三日起至十五日止，渝共軍遺屍四十六具，被俘四十人，日軍裁獲輕機槍二挺，步槍十三枝，手槍十一枝，及其他彈藥等甚夥，幷徹底覆減共軍工廠。</p>
<h3>湘北日軍擴大戰果　渝軍退路被截斷　日空軍猛炸煖水街</h3>
<p>漢口十六八日中央社電　湖南渝軍主要道路因日軍殲渝第十集團軍後，已遭遮斷。致該處渝軍徬徨於西齊·孟溪寺·公安等三角形內山地。日陸軍航空部隊復應地上進攻部隊爲殲滅被圍渝軍，特於十六日晨大舉出動，在煖水街附近猛炸渡河中之渝軍，並以機槍掃射，將其擊潰。又另一日機隊亦猛炸集結於煖水街西南閘口附近之渝軍大隊，予以重創。渝軍因日軍空陸猛攻，故已完全喪失戰意，預料一二日內，即將全部被殲。溯日軍在洞庭湖畔展開殲滅戰後，迄今尙僅十日，即已澈底粉碎渝第廿九集團軍，第十集團軍共九師約九萬人。在地域方面言，則日軍自洞庭湖南岸沅江北方往安鄉津市北方至宣都附近，已掌握寬二百公里，長八十公里之廣大地域，於此向長沙常德進攻，即可樹立制渝方於死命之勢態，且渝方第六戰區因喪失前鋒最强之兩集團軍後，實力已大爲减低，乃不得不向渝乞援。</p>
<p>漢口十六日中央社電　據湘南前綫十二日來電，湘南北路日軍尾追江南山野之渝軍，向前挺進，勢如破竹，在大中堰·順林饉·孟溪寺·彭家廠附近，經三日之激戰，將渝「第四十三師」「第三百廿七第一百廿八團」及「第五十師第一百十八團」之一部約二千人完全擊潰。是役渝軍遺屍六百五十具，被俘三百卅人，內有將校五人，日軍奪獲迫擊砲二門，重機關槍六挺，輕機關槍十二挺，步槍一百廿挺，擲彈筒五個，手溜彈六百五十枚，馬卅五匹。</p>

<h3>天津山海關間定期實行　保稅及監視運輸</h3>
<p>北京十六日中央社電　自大東亞戰爭着着進展後，中日滿三國間之陸路運輸，亦益見重要，尤其中國北方各省市與滿洲國間，過去因須在山海關辦理中滿關稅事務，故難期貨運之圓滑及運輸量之增加。有關當局有鑒於此，前曾積極研究對策，現已決定在大津山海關間實施保稅運輸及監視運輸制度。並定自六月一日起實行，天津海關監督特發出佈吿謂，由鐵道運輸貨物至天津之保稅運輸，前須在山海關分關請求許可，茲自六月一日起，得於天津海關辦理輸入手續；又運往山海關之監視運輸，前須請求天津海關許可者，自六月一日起，得於天津海關辦理輸出手續。此項辦法實施後，預料不僅山海關方面運貨問題可以消除，且可縮短貨物運輸時間，在邋輸時又可减少事故，並减輕運費，又能使通關事務趨於簡捷，此外在天津方面之貿易統制及滙兌機關，在辦理通關手續時，亦可大爲便利，故裨益於各方面者，實非淺鮮。</p>

<p>東京十六日中央社電　日當局鑒於完遂戰爭，必須先增强國民身心，爲使國民澈底認識此項意旨起見，前曾定五月一日至十日爲全國健民運動强調期間。全國各地，在此期間，莫不舉行各種健民運動，其目的一方固在增進國民之健康，但同時亦爲毅然完遂戰爭而謀國民精神之昂揚。此次健民運動要綱有六：（一）昂揚日本民族精神，（二）亟謀戰爭生活澈底化，（三）增加生產，獎勵結婚，（四）謀母子保健，（五）保護國民身體健康，預防撲滅肺病及性病。抑爲遂行戰爭人口之迅速而繼續增加，實爲必要，蓋戰事愈延長，則戰爭部門亦必愈多，而各部門自皆需人主持，如補充作戰兵力，需要靑年增强軍需生產，則需要產業鬥士，至於從事復興建設，以主鞏固後方之各部門份子，亦悉須具有健强之身心，始克負荷重任，此爲國家發展計，爲完成建設東亞之理想及謀民族永久生存計，皆有其必要，因而日本方面，對於確保人力更生，質量雙方，同時求其充實，故此次之展開健民運動，其主因亦即在於此。日厚生當局，爲期澈底實踐此項運動，故所有國家關係機關，如新聞雜誌無錢電等，及國民組織基本單位，如隣組學校公司工廠等，俱悉在動員之列，肺結核病即所謂「文明病』，世界醫學界曾爲撲滅此病，而作最大努力。日本爲確保人力，增强戰力，刻亦作種種努力。靑年爲軍隊及產業鬥士之重要份子，必需使其避免。肺結核菌檢查，並舉行健民展覽會，獎勵預防肺病，復爲使初期患者，迅速恢復健康起見，召開全國療養所長會議，設置「增健寮」，以利息者，對於應行療養之患者，則强迫其就醫。又兒童原爲國家次代主人翁，爲謀民族之生存及發展，自應力謀增進其健康，因此日厚生當局，復在各地舉行兒童訓練及嬰兒審查會，期使國民對此獲得深切之認識。又爲保護撫肯兒童之母親及產婦起見，乃曾行「母子會」及勤勞母親大會等，褒揚生育較多之勤勞母親，復召開育兒報國大會，以普及育見常識，對於孕婦及產婦之糧食及其他生活必須品，優先配給，以保護母體。此次運動展開後，並普遍實施孕婦免費身體檢查，以期孕婦保健之寓全，同時又爲培養健康之神，故於各地舉行練武會，鍊成會，健步會等，鍛鍊國民身心，以期智能技術及體力之同時增進。此外日本方面，並因民族力之增强，以增加人口爲先決問題。故將乘此次運動展開之便，獎勵健全之結婚及適當之早婚，並規定結婚年齡標準，男子爲廿五歲以上，女子爲廿一歲以上。同時使各團體各隣組斡旋結婚。又日當局因當此戰時戰爭與生活具有密切不可分之關係，但國民生活長此緊張，對於前綫不無影響，因此謀戰時生活之澈底，實屬必要，乃先謀衣食住之改革，以養成刻苦耐勞之精神。另一方面，以保育有勇往邁進之氣慨與簡素剛健之性格爲自標，或實行街頭廣播，體操，或利用空地舉行隣組運動會。日本民族硏究所長高田保馬博士，曾謂「能克服貧困與勞苦之身心，乃爲使民族永遠生存永遠發展之推進力。」今日日本國民之生存，乃以高田氏之此　爲座右銘，而鞏固必勝之決意與自信，以謀戰時生活之澈底與打倒英美。此次健民運動甫吿結束，故未能迅速期其成果，但其精神上影響日本國民者，實決匪淺鮮，良以此次運動雖吿結束，但日本國民仍無日不在前進中，以打倒英美爲目的，繼續鍛鍊身體，現戰爭日趨激烈，日本國民之鍛鍊身心，乃亦愈趨澈底，愈趨充實云。</p>
<h3>英在緬連戰連敗　士兵已無鬥意　布其頓失陷後孟多又告危急</h3>
<p>日溪十六日中央社電　英印軍自緬甸失陷以後，即深感苦悶，故對於奪回日溪企圖，頗爲積極。最近復變更過去驅使印兵於前綫之消極戰法，而由英兵自仟第一綫，其主力部隊，爲英印軍中最精銳之第六旅。但此種企圖，終被日軍巧妙擊破，距離印度二十公里之布其頓，即已被日軍占領。又據路透社加爾各答電傳，緬印國境之孟多，又吿危殆云。倫敦泰晤士報特電，並列舉英印軍進攻日溪之敗因，有下列三點，（一）英國於初戰占優勢後，不能繼續把握戰果。（二）後方之給養不能充分。（三）印度總督府忽視印緬間之陸上運輸等云。其尤竭力指出後方給養之不充分一點，希圖向反軸心軍及印度民衆，搪塞英軍戰敗之責任，但據調查，敵由馬酉山脈西方頓貝庫至孟多，築有相當平坦之汽車路，沿馬酉山脈東側山脚，亦有堅固之驛道。又爲聯絡驟道與軍用汽車道路起見，乃橫斷山脈而在阿涪德南刺（馬酉山脈東方）緬印間，開闢驛道，但此適被日軍利用，作爲進攻之道途。又敵在合巴古丕，建有防禦雨季之兵若野戰醫院，在印典及基滋歐，建有糧秣倉庫。此外復在各要地　設給養機關，觀此種種，可知此次英印軍之戰敗原因，仍須歸咎於英印軍連戰速敗以後，已喪失戰意，而英印軍間歷來醞釀之相互傾軋，至此乃亦臻於表面化。</p>
<h3>日佔領地更名稱　設專門委員會</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日大本營於五月十四日發表中謂，美軍已於阿留申羣島之阿圖島登陸，日軍刻正與其激戰中云，按阿圖島自去年六月八日爲日軍佔領後，即改名爲熱田島。此次大本營發表中所以不用熱田島名稱者，蓋因熱田島一名，原爲現地日軍部隊所起，現尙未正式決定，故於公文中仍用阿圖島舊名。其他如鳴神島，大烏等名，亦均爲現地日軍部隊所　，刻尙未正式決定，關於佔領地名改稱事宜，內閣中設有佔領地名委員會專司其事，現馬來昭南爪加爾達等均爲由該委員會決定後，始正式改稱者。</p>
<h3>婆羅洲當局組織　內地視察隊</h3>
<p>馬辰十六日中央社電　此地日軍政當局，爲視察婆羅洲內地情况，並調查其資源起見，特由資源調查班民政部職員，及當地警察等，組織「婆羅洲內地視察隊。」一行業於日昨由此出發，預料此行對婆羅洲之開發計劃，必有莫大之貢獻云。</p>
<p>北京通訉</p>
<h3>北京的大學校</h3>
<p>— 學子</p>
<p>今年北京的春天特別的短。三星期前一陣春寒還帶走了不少的生命，現在是曰色西裝已經在王府井大街出現了。然而今年的春天却非常的明媚裏公園的丁香開得分外的嬌艷，朱委員長也會興致勃勃的柬請友好，到他私邸去舉行「賞靈大讌」，而朋友某老先生家。的海棠，據說也開得比那一年都香盛，使他不由得笑逐顏開的說：「今年應該要走好運了罷！」</p>
<p>這裏，且一看成爲北京花魂所在的敎育界的幸運如何？</p>
<p>事變以前，北京是中國敎育界的大本營。光就大學論，除了北大·燕京·淸華·師大·輔仁所謂「五大學」之外，還有平大各學院，協和醫學院，中法大學，藝專和中國大學，朝陽大學，東北大學等等，擁有好幾萬的大學生。當然那時候這些大學生偶爾也騷騷嚷嚷，弄得老人家們頭暈目眩，然而却也沒有鬧斷絃歌。現在只剩下了燕京，協和，輔仁和中法，另外在私立大學方面則有中國大學還依樣的存在。後來師大和北大恢復了，又加上一個新民學院，可是「扶得東來西又倒」，中法先就隨着法蘭西的敗戰而停辦了，繼之去的是燕京和協和。</p>
<p>師大和北大的恢復，是在萬分因難情景之下。雖然在沙灘大紅樓背面蓋有十分摩登的北大新校舍，然而建築的輝煌並不能充實內容。圖書館的藏書已不及以前的豐富了。當燕京封閉的時候，各學校曾有一度的熱閙。再由政府的努力，大部份的燕京學生被派到北大各學院去續學，而一部份的燕京敎職員也自然而然的流轉到北大，師大去。然而燕京的人馬畢竟有限，再加上輔仁和中國大學的分配，爲數極微，而大部份的有名敎授又多半退休，事實上並沒有增加多大的力量。</p>
<p>然而輔仁和中國却熱鬧起來了。這居五大學殿軍而尙有落選危險的輔仁，在燕京封閉以後，却忽而站在敎育界的先鋒，至少在一般平民的口氣裏是如此。可是，目下也隨着社會經濟的環境而較遜一籌了。中國大學也够幸運，事變以前無論如何它也振作不起來的學校，現在却是第一等的私立大學了。一部份比較好的燕京敎授居然也被何校長請到這兒來，而學生的數目也就跟着增多。可是因爲基礎未固，經濟困難，下學年之是否還能留得住敎授和學生也就成爲問題了。</p>
<p>這種不景氣的原因，不只是缺乏師資和學科，同時也在於學生數目的低减。這些學生到底那兒失了呢？因爲經濟的壓迫，不得不改行的也很多，但是大部份却是呆在家裏不上課。不上課本來就是一部分年靑人所喜歡的，何况現在還有經濟上的理由呢！</p>
<p>生活担子太重了。米價是從一斤一毛左右漲到三塊多錢。每一個學生的費用每年至少要二千金，而畢業之後就算是找到了高尙的職業，恐怕還得不到這半數的報酬。現在是打算盤的時節，一位女傭每月得花上一百張一元的鈔票。縱使用經濟　辦法，下課時可以到馬路旁邊的排攤上買他一兩個燒餅或窩窩頭之類來應付一下輾轉的飢腸，有時也可以在那兒碰到不再高自標置的師長，四目瞪視，相對而笑，然而總不如閒坐庭園，還可以打掃打掃從戈壁被西北風帶到院子裏的塵沙，泡泡茶，燒燒飯，旣可以節省每年二三千金的學費，又可以省下每月一百張一元鈔票的傭人代價。就是在這種時代的算盤之下，去年輔仁因爲要實行新經濟政策，想靠多招新生來維持校費，居然在一千二百名左右的報名生中錄取了將近一千名左右，一時也與高采烈的自鳴得意，可是不久又在報紙上登載續招新生的廣吿，因爲在一千名左右的錄取新生中，却只有二三百名報到，反之，這一學期却有五百名左右的退學生。</p>
<p>敎授們是整天的奔走衣食，除了到處兼課，獵取飯碗之外，吃够了粉筆灰，挾着書包，耳赤臉紅的和緊追着强求坐車的洋車夫吵鬧了一陣，氣憤憤的走到家門之後，還得自操勞役。學生們是打好書箱回到家裏當跑腿外，還要洗衣服，倒穢土，再也沒有工夫寫情書了。這十餘年來祗見於紙上的所謂「勞工神聖」，在這環境的巨臂之下，算是一聲不響的爬上了實際的生活。於是，當局就出來提倡「生產敎育」。除了在報紙上宣傅以外，還下令各學校在春假期內舉行師生耕作運動。然而引不起正和貧窮格鬥的師生們的興趣，結果，逃工的逃工，敷衍了，事的敷衍了事，在那新開墾而由網球塲改造過來的農塲上，却並沒有長出油綠的嫩芽。</p>
<p>「生產敎育」，不失其爲補救時弊的一種方法，工讀制度也確有把失去了的學生重新拉到講堂上的可能。然而要如何實現，却是一個値得硏究的問題。（五月十日）</p>

<h3>義對地中海諸島　作萬全防禦措置　深信必可粉碎敵軍進攻企圖英美如圖在歐登陸犧牲必大</h3>
<p>羅馬十六日中央社電　義陸次斯奎諾中將，十五日於上院舉行之財政委員會中，盛讚突尼西亞方面義軍作戰之英勇，及義國國民激昂之精神，並言及今後戰局謂，地中海諸島，已在義參謀本部指揮下，作萬全防禦措置。今後以義國陸軍首腦部之雄韜偉略，及義軍將士之英勇，必可粉碎敵軍進攻企圖。海次李加爾弟提督，繼而宣稱，義國海軍，已整備應付任何事態之姿勢，略謂，義海軍於北非作戰中所進行之海上輔給戰，曾與敵方龐大艦隊及空軍不斷激戰，尤以於過去六個月中，敵方集結全部艦艇於狹隘水域中，故當時之作戰，實深困難，當義國參戰伊始，海軍界權威人士，會預言義海軍於各水域上之抵抗能力，力殆難支持數月，但迄今時逾三年，吾人仍予敵軍以重大威脅。末由空次浦吉爾大將發表謂，義空軍自參戰以來，計炸沉敵商船一四五艘，共一〇六〇〇〇噸，又炸沉敵艦艇六七艘，其中有巡洋艦二十艘，驅逐艦二十一艘，潛艇七艘，又擊落敵機計二三四二架其中一九四四架係於空戰中擊落者，此外幷重創敵機約千架，同時義空軍幷會遝輸軍隊六十一萬人，及軍需資料四萬二千噸，供給前綫。</p>
<p>羅馬十六日中央社電　義軍司令部十五日發表戰報，（一）德軍轟炸機隊，曾於十四日晚轟炸波奴港，炸沉油槽船一艘，並炸傷中型貨船一艘。（二）敵機會於十四日空襲巴勒摩及撒丁羣島等，市民略有傷亡，義高射砲隊擊落其十一架。（三）義機曾在撒丁島東岸海面，與敵機發生空戰，擊落敵機二架。</p>
<p>羅馬十六日中央社電　義郵報今日稱，自西法至希土邊界之地中海海岸，暨地中海之最大各島嶼，現均已在軸心掌握中，當第一次世界大戰時，地中海本屬英國勢力範圍，沿岸各地，均被與英聯盟之國家統治，各港口與根據地，祗有英國艦隊可以自由出入，彼時活躍於地中海之德潛艇，祇十艘至十六艘，然仍能給英方以二百五十萬噸之龐大損失，致使英國大部航運，改經好望角繞行。處目下情形下，英國必須愼防地中海義艦或　潛艇曁德輕艦與龐大空軍之威力，決非在第一次世界大戰時之得傲視一切。又論及英美企圖在地中海登陸之計劃，該報謂二年前邱吉爾曾自認克里特島一役，英軍所受之損失，蓋供應不濟，登陸難逞，登陸之軍必須與海中船隻保持密切之聯絡，達達尼爾峽冒險之舉，可謂前車之鑒也云。</p>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　北非戰事結束後，地中海戰局之發展，頗爲一般人士所關心，軸心軍之被迫退出北非，僅爲英美軍進攻歐洲大陸之先聲，故實難左右戰局之大勢，而英美軍圖由北非基地進攻歐洲南部方面者，更不難想像，衆認此事，英美會在加港早已予討論，但英美能否實行此種計劃，尙屬疑問。以言歐洲南側，東起巴爾幹，西至伊伯利亞，海岸綫極爲綿長。自鄧扣克之役以後，德國並未繼之進攻英本土，故英國防備，將慚臻鞏固，依比爲例，則今日奕尼西亞戰爭，旣已結束，英美若不立即在歐洲實行登陸作戰，則其困難，亦必將愈益增多。衆認目下英美大事轟炸班泰雷利亞，西西里，撒丁等各島者，亦爲新作戰之凖備。但此次與去秋北非登陸作戰，情形逈不相同，即須在交戰國之本土登陸，從常識而言，實行此種作戰，須忍受莫大犧牲，美英是否將孤注一擲，以圖完全制霸西西里海峽，抑或於其他地點，實行登陸作戰，尙不能遽下判斷，常自開羅作戰會談舉行後，世人即對巴爾幹方面之動態，密切注視，但　英美之近東軍狀况與土耳其之態度而觀，暫時將來必成爲問題，一方面英美對伊伯利亞半島，亦似進行各種工作，但軸心軍之在突尼西亞奮戰六閱月，足證歐洲大陸南側防備之强固，幷使其能配置大軍，益以科西嘉撒丁西西里克里特羅得等各島，均安然無恙，軸心軍必將藉此死守，以阻英美軍之接近大陸云。</p>
<h3>華盛頓會議中　英美意見紛歧　在太平洋上難有何新行動</h3>
<p>斯德哥爾摩十六日中央社電　現時隱現於此次華盛頓會議之最重大問題，爲修正加薩勃朗加會議之議決，及應否視日本爲反軸心國之最大敵人問題。華維爾元帥，蘇墨維爾上將，貝爾斯元帥，史蒂維爾中將，及奧外長埃瓦特博士等之參與會議，可見會議所討論者，不僅關於歐洲之戰塲，且亦關於東方之戰事。此種見解係根據於下列事實，其一，自本年以來，麥克沃塞將軍總部，輿漢洲政府，曾屢次要求更多之人力及物資，並指出日本之準備在太平洋西南部採更進一步行動。其二，已轉變之孤立份子，已開始大聲疾呼，要求美國專注於太平洋方面之行動，蓋彼等明瞭美國對於歐洲之戰後問題，殊少置喙之餘地，從最近之蘇波爭執中，已可槪見。其三，自經透露日本有充份之船艦，以從事於太平洋上之新冀圖後，美國更爲憂懼日本，在完成穩定大東亞之後，將成爲强不可敵。凡此種種事實，可闈明美國大衆輿論之最近趨向。以下各點，則可表明英國方面之思想。其一，在去年十二月間，「經濟學者報」，尙不重視日本在南洋方面之活動，蓋雖承認日本將該方面地區組織之後，實力必將大有增加，但相信日本缺少充足之商船。其次，倫敦每日電訊於星期四評論華盛頓會議，力言必須在太平洋有新行動，但又力言「英美領袖顯然仍一致以爲彼等之首要任務，爲打倒希特勒，擊破德國之軍隊，關於此點，觀察家之意見，以爲英國希望儘速解决歐洲戰事，而使澳洲印度及其他東方地區，受其影響，此即爲英美意見參差之最大一點。因此預期華盛頓之主要討論，將集中於决定英美應付新局勢之新世界戰略，並解決意見上之基本衝突，但觀察家相信，此項衝突不能完滿解決，蓋未得蘇聯之合作，則英美不能在太平洋有任何新行動，觀察家指出蘇聯並無欲破壞與日本所訂之不侵犯公約之表示，因此反軸心之戰略，似爲分配其一部份之軍力於西方，一部份於東方。</p>
<p>東京十大日中央社電　當茲北非戰局急務直下，反軸心軍盛傳展開歐洲登陸作戰之際，美白宮當局，突於十一日發表英首相邱吉爾偕英陸海空軍首腦訪美，刻與羅斯福總統會談中云，其中關於邱吉爾抵華盛頓之時間，及會談內容，毫未言及，但據英消息靈通方面人士之觀察謂，此次會談之中心，似爲一協議默洲第二戰綫之時間及地點，二修正卡港會談所商方略，三調停蘇波糾紛等事。溯反軸心陣營，雖自突尼西亞作戰開始後，即盛大宣傳，於歐洲展開登陸作戰。其間更由蘇聯之一角呼籲，於是第二戰綫之聲，一時甚　塵上，但英美兩國，則當歐洲戰後經營（按茲即英美蘇三國勢力範圍）尙未劃定以前，彼等決不願犧牲本國而爲蘇聯謀取利益，冒險進攻歐洲，故其時第二戰綫之不能結成，實屬當然。其次，彼等縱對加港會談所商辦法加以修正，但重慶澳洲新西蘭等對英美之歐洲重點主義，始終表示反對，現華府之反軸心聯合作戰本部，與澳洲之西南太平洋反軸心軍司令部之間，意見殊爲分歧，故時至今日，實有修正加港會談之歐洲重點主義之必要。但其先決之問題，乃爲歐洲登陸作戰，但反軸心陣營在歐洲決定之勢力圈，又足以左右歐洲登陸作戰之展開，第一協議調停蘇波紛爭方式，將爲此次羅邱會談之惟一問題，良以自突尼西亞戰局吿結束後，蘇波紛爭已不僅爲蘇波兩國之問題，且爲反軸心陣營之最重要之政治問題，蘇波紛爭，若不先行解決，決定歐洲勢力圈，則歐洲登陸作戰，終難實行。英外長艾登曾爲調伴蘇波紛爭而赴華府，勾留甚長，極力奔走，但終無所獲，而此次邱吉爾不辭勞苦，與羅斯福舉行會談，能否成功，而不可測。</p>
<p>庫壁希夫十六日中央社電　蘇聯報紙，對於英首相邱吉爾與美總統羅斯福現時在華盛頓舉行之會議，至今尙未加以評論。蘇聯報紙僅刊載英國情報局及白宮所發邱吉爾訪華盛頓之宜吿。</p>
<h3>庫班區德突擊隊　奇襲蘇主要陣地　蘇軍陣亡被俘者人數極多列寗格勒區德亦展開攻勢</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十六日中央社電　據前綫消息傳，庫班橋頭堡地區德突擊隊，奇襲蘇軍有力要塞陣地，經激戰後，已將蘇軍重要陣地佔領，是役蘇軍陣亡者一五〇〇人，被俘者大約相等，蘇軍並喪失武器及其他資材甚多。另一方面，德平射砲部隊，於狄姆雷克此方之江口，擊沉滿載兵員，企圖登陸之蘇舟艇二十八艘。傳列寗格勒戰綫之德軍，亦於猛烈砲擊後，展開攻勢。蘇軍機關報「紅星報」，已承認德軍已於某地開始攻勢，並對德軍攻勢，表示憂慮。據德國通訊社消息傳，德突擊隊於唐納資中部地區，及拉多加湖南方地區，亦突入蘇軍陣地，佔領蘇軍堡壘及步兵陣地多處。</p>
<p>赫爾辛基十六日中央社電　斯蒂芬尼社引芬軍高級指揮部，昨日公報稱，在過去二十四小時間，卡累利亞地峽，曾有局部斥堠活動，及砲隊互轟，在同一戰終之西段，蘇軍一隊，會發動攻擊，但被擊退，且受重創，其他戰綫並無重要消息。</p>
<p>百倫十五日中央社電　柏林電訊云，德軍曾進攻庫班橋頭堡之蘇軍陣地，並殲滅敵軍數隊，其他區域繼續沉寂。德軍曾開砲轟擊拉多湖以南及列寗格勒之鐵道及工廠，德羅軍利用戰事靜寂之機會，趕作種種準備，以防蘇軍之大規模攻勢，因蘇軍近日調動頻繁，且由後方運到大批重兵器也。德軍方面曾以轟炸機猛攻蘇方之運輸部隊，砲位機塲及鐵道，蘇軍喉舌斯維斯達報載稱，德軍之春季攻勢，自在意料之中，惟究在何地首先發動，則難預料，德軍在若干區域，已有大批軍隊集中，並在莫斯科以南之奧里爾與庫斯克區域，從事準備，可見德軍有進攻莫斯科之可能，該報又促蘇軍應準備勿怠云。</p>
<h3>叙利亞伊朗等地　土著反英甚烈</h3>
<p>安加拉十六日中央社電　據此間接傳消息，巴力斯坦及叙利亞，依然紛亂，該地之國家主義份子，正對英侵略者反抗。在海法附近之納達尼亞地方之巴力斯坦共黨辦事處，曾被未經認明之人所搗毀所有文件傢具，及列寗與史太林之照片。此等辦事處，乃共黨之大本營，且爲駐於納達尼亞附近英軍中共產主義宣傳之中心。據斯蒂芬尼社引達馬斯加消息，叙利亞之國家主義份子，曾炸燬賽達附近立達尼河上之火車鐵橋，致該路之火車交通，停頓數日。英軍當局已逮捕該處地區之農民一百五十人，冀圖獲得罪犯。又據斯蒂芬尼社另一消息稱，叙利亞之特雅埃爾錫奧高爾地方，奉命收取小麥之徵收吏員，被農民以步槍攻擊，吏昌等即請求英軍協助，向村民開槍，死數人，傷多人，此外英軍並縱火焚燬數處村落，以爲報復。</p>
<p>伊斯坦布爾十六日中央社電　伊朗各地之騷擾事件，頻起層出，雖經反軸心軍一再鎮壓，迄未稍减，據德黑蘭來電，克的斯坦地方，又發生大規模之騷擾事件，大批伊人，分成三隊，襲擊英駐軍，破壞一切設施，搶奪食糧及武器，並殺死英軍數人。伊朗憲兵隊及印軍一大隊，聞訊當即趕到，與伊人發生衝突，聞伊憲兵隊傷亡多人。</p>
<h3>阿根廷以小麥　供給西班牙</h3>
<p>瑪德里十六日中央社電　此間昨日透露，阿根廷現仍依照去年底與西班牙所訂之協定，繼續於每隔一定之時間，以小麥輸至西班牙，所有自阿根廷運至西班牙之小麥，皆係由西船裝載，西班牙貨船蒙特奧斯號，預計不久將自信諾斯愛勒，載有小麥三千六百噸，及大麥五千噸，至西班牙。</p>
<h3>英電台廣播　否認德軍登陸</h3>
<p>里斯本十六日中央社電　近日盛　德軍已在英國沿海若干地點登陸，故英國廣播公司特於昨日播音，正式予以否認，據稱，首相邱吉爾在華盛頓播音，曾提及德軍有侵犯英國可能，致上項謠言復起云。</p>
<h3>美共和黨擬戴　麥克沃塞競選</h3>
<p>阿京十六日中央社電　斯蒂芬尼社轉，據華盛頓消息，參院議員密執安共和黨范敦堡氏，曁其他重要共和黨員，已開始宣傳，擬推麥克沃塞將軍爲共和黨代表，以與羅總統在下屆總統競選時相對抗，衆意麥將軍最受大衆擁戴，且除上次世界大戰外，歷來當選總統，均爲軍人，如華盛頓傑克遜·泰勒·格朗脫等。故麥將軍之當選總統，誠屬意中事云</p>
<h3>玻總統與美總統　發表共同宣言</h3>
<p>阿京十六日中央社電　玻利維亞總統卡斯梯羅抵華府後，即予維總統發聯合宣吿稱，對兩國切身利害問題，已加討論，玻利維亞刻正以錫竭橡皮與奎寗，供給美國，兩國目已締結協約，以加强雙方之合作。</p>
<h3>世界史上的一大悲劇（五）</h3>
<p>— 德富豬一郎</p>
<p>（五）空論亡國</p>
<p>英國政黨政治的流　最爲著明的一種，是並不爲着政見而爭辯，而是爲了議論而爭辯。總括一句話，是空論亡國。英國人本來是常識的國民，是實行的國民；然而從政黨政治成立以來，英國人却成了言論　國民了。言論的國民，寖漸而爲空論的國民，自是必然的趨勢。</p>
<p>摩爾雷曾經說道：</p>
<p>「我們黨人的最大的苦厄，是不管黨派相互間的意見實際上差不多相同，總是硬要把牠說得黑白互殊，不可兩立似的，叫一般人首肯。」</p>
<p>摩爾雷夙有「正直的約翰」（約翰爲摩爾雷的名字）的稱號，是在政黨中人格最爲高卓的一個人，也是以對於愛爾蘭自治論爲格蘭斯頓所倚爲左右手著稱的人。他這樣說，恐怕無論什麼人不會信不過的吧</p>
<p>不管妥協交讓，原是英國人的本色，爲了政黨政治的緣故，非但談不到交讓，併且還要各走極端，勢不兩立似地對待着，在言論上針鋒相對，以圖獲取政權或是保持旣獲的政權。</p>
<p>這樣，自從施行議院政治以來，英國就沒有經世家，政治家，英國議院幾成爲那僅僅能辯，達辯，詭辯，贅辯等等饒舌家逞其無用的辯論的巢窟。於是乎政黨的領袖不消說有爲之士，如其要立身上進，祇有沈浸於議會的辯論，用以獵取政界的高位或最高位。</p>
<p>這恰如中國所有的政治家之概爲能文達筆之士一般，英國的政治家，縱有訥辯，能辯之差，總沒有不會喋舌饒嘴的；否則就不能成爲政治家。因而就是在國家危急的時候，他們所專心致志的，與其說是把其意見端的陳訴於國民之前，還不如說是在於怎樣才能開陳模範的能辯。</p>
<p>第一次世界戰爭的開頭，當時外交部長葛雷等的演說，是怎樣地優妙，簡潔明白，眞率而動人，到現在還被人們嘖嘖稱道。便是在這回第二次世界大戰中像邱吉爾的議會演說或是播音，在英國品評其那麼那麼好或那麼那麽不好，恰像我國的戲　品評戲子菊五郞，吉右衛門的演藝一般。</p>
<p>所以英國的政治家與其說是國家經綸之士，還不如說是嘴巴的藝術家。那麼英國的政治家由律師出身的是怎樣地多，是決不是不可思議的。</p>
<p>彼特（William　Pitt,the　Younger）以後，佔相位最長久的，愛斯葵士（H.H.Asqnite）也是律師。那起初爲愛斯葵士的同僚，嗣爲其屬下，最後取愛斯葵士而代之的勞合喬治，也原是鄉村的下等律師。像現在從自由黨經種種變化而爲大法官的西門，也是律師。</p>
<p>在保守黨，那柏肯黑德（F.E.S.Birkenhead）就是爲平民司密斯的大律師。保守黨反對愛爾蘭目洽案的最後勇將卡爾松，也是法廷上最有力的辯護土之一。律師雖在法廷上是必要的，可是對於國家經綸之業，必須有俟於經國之士。</p>
<p>至於經國之士，不是可以用口才來充數的。像日本大久保甲東，西鄉南洲，除了因有必要而陳述其意見之外，不輕易開口的。在英國也偶而有其例外的——例如基徹納（H.H.Kitchener）將軍。在議會政治達於最高潮的時候，正是英國政治退化到最低潮的時候。</p>
<p>我們且來說，那議院政治最惡劣的一個例子的愛爾蘭自治案吧，愛爾蘭自昔爲英國的癌，現在依然是癌，將來恐怕還是癌吧。看定愛爾蘭是個癌，要施以外科的治療的，是格蘭斯頓。世問很有許多人以爲格蘭斯頓所以和愛爾蘭自治黨握手的，是因爲他要由着自治黨的援助以獲得或保持他的政權的緣故。事實究竟是不是這樣，那可不知道了。</p>
<p>總之，這確實是一個賢明的措置。如果當時允許了愛爾蘭自治，那現在愛爾蘭成爲愛爾國，和英國全然沒有關涉，不至於取着像在英國的咽喉跟頭，刺刺匕首的那樣態度了。然而那從反對這自治案的保守黨跟自由黨分立出來的張伯倫等一派，和保守黨聯合，在統一黨的名義之下，以獨佔政權。到一九〇六年，自由黨方才獲見了曙光。但是，其間自治黨雖曾一時地獲得政權，只是從格蘭斯頓的最後的內閣（一八九二年八月至一八九四年三月）以迄繼承他的羅斯培利（A.P.P.Rosebery）的最　內閣（一八九四年三月—九五年六月），不旋踵而政權仍然復歸於原來的保守黨。</p>
<p>自由黨獲得政權，再行通過愛爾蘭自治案，却又遭遇上院的反對，終於不獲當施。正在千辛萬苦方纔達到目的，行將實施的時候，又値愛德華七世崩駕，喬治五世當政。當其新政之初，依着國王命令，在宮中開兩黨的妥協會議，以國王的周旋，竟還不能合致。方要實行，那爲反對黨的保守黨，不顧議會的決議等，斷然在愛爾蘭輸入武器，徵募兵士，以非自治黨的最硬派卡爾松司密斯爲主將，正要發動內亂的時候，而第一次世界大戰發生了、因此，這問題遂中止下來，經過五年的躭延，正待舊事重提而愛爾蘭已經不同意於原來的自治案，差不多以獨立國的態度對向英國了。</p>
<p>因着這樣的情勢，人心汹汹，暗殺大行，安寗秩序無法維持，英國不得不爲最後的讓步，而愛爾蘭共和國就此成立了。於是愛爾蘭全然和本國隔離，把英國所設置的總督趕走，現在改國號爲愛爾；不管英國和德宣戰，愛爾蘭斷然守着中立，差不多是全然獨立的姿態。其他的殖民地，雖然承諾依着對於英國王的忠誠而爲大英聯邦之一，而愛爾蘭却連矢忠誠的官言尙還加以拒絕。</p>
<p>從自治案以至於獨立，五十年間的英國跟愛爾蘭的歷史關係，不能不說是給政黨政治貽誤國家的重大國是立下證　的一大罪案。從前克倫威爾對於長座議院下解散的命令時，聲言如次：</p>
<p>一六五三年四月二十日，大統師克倫威爾走淮議會，坐在一個椅子上，傾耳聽着。可是終於不能忍耐了，立了起來，說道「給我出去！」「已經儘够了，我希望你們停止　絮聒！……你們那樣還要自稱爲議會，就算是議會，也幹麼。……你們的中間，不是醉漢，就是屁精，……像你們這班傢伙，怎麼能保持上帝的恩寵而爲議會。吁！去吧！我命令着……。」他擎起了爲議會權力的神聖的表章的巨槌，說道：「這宗廢物怎麼收拾好呢？還是把牠摔掉了好吧」</p>
<p>像這樣英國的議會，簡直是個蟬噪蛙鳴的塲所，而他們的長此喋喋饒舌，終像蜩鳴送晚似的，陷英國於衰亡。（丁：譯自五月二日東部每日新聞）</p>

<h3>乘電車無車票　責任問題</h3>
<p>電車賣票揩油陋習，雖經電車公司當局一再取締，迄今並無成效，以致公司收入頗受打擊，昨日電車公司某高級職員稱：關於售票揩油事，當局一再設法彌補缺憾，除增添便衣查票外，唯一辦法，即盼乘客能與當局密切連絡，乘客務須向賣票員取得與所付代價相符之車票，否則可秘密抄錄賣票員之號碼，通知公司，公司當有嚴厲之處罰辦法，該職員又稱：如售票員捺扣乘客之車蔡，而乘客不與交涉，則一旦被查票員發覺，則無車票之責任，須由乘客自負，故乘客爲自身之利益計，亦應密切注意賣票員之揩油也。查賣票揩油，公司理應切實取締，乘客如拒付車資，則無票之責任，應由乘客負之，如已付車資，或賣票故意緩收，或已收而緩付車票，則其責任何在，似應加以分別，在另一方面，賣票之生活問題，似亦可予硏究。</p>

<h3>小民的呼籲</h3>
<p>（一）廢除雜捐　王禎祥</p>
<p>社會物價日日高漲，而捐稅月月　加，　這種捐稅對於政府的收入微乎其微，而人民之負担重之又中。因這種雜捐多屬包辦，將市區的筵席捐一項而論，（現歸市府徵收）包捐者按月呈繳不過三萬元，而其　收超出五十餘萬元，最起碼的陽春麵亦難倖免，飽了少數包捐人之私衰，苦了多數小民，亟望當局設法糾正。</p>
<p>（二）嚴禁拆屋　君拔</p>
<p>南市房屋大半因戰事被焚，瓦礫之塲，每街均有，遂使一輩慣居南市民衆，欲思遷回而苦無房屋，大有求過於供，致房東奇貨可居，高抬頂費，業丰亦以材料昂貴，無力重建。詎知一般喪盡天良之徒，以木材來源不暢，收買房屋，拆卸出售，藉博厚利，不顧當局復與市面之艱難，雖一再命奮嚴禁，而彼輩仍百計追實，依然可拆，致南市房屋，日漸减少，荒地日有增加。敢請當局，即日重申嚴令，切實辦理，協助取締一切尙未拆除，而已訂契約之房屋，再嚴緝行賄私拆，則我南市復興，有厚望焉。</p>
<p>（三）根絕煙賭　燕翼</p>
<p>上海特別市長陳公博氏接任後，　發表談話，謂決心根絕滬市烟賭，可是直到現在，我們所看到的，祗是南市的賭塲烟窟，代替了滬西興起來，其他閘北·虹口等小型的漸漸地蔓延產生着，但是我們相信決不是市政當局不嚴厲執行，也許是由於某種恃有特殊勢力者從中阻梗，以致未克收澈底根除的効果。</p>
<p>俱樂部·戒吸所一類危害人民國家的費疣，全國各地都有滋生着。我們切盼賢明的執政者來淸理根絕一下，決不讓害民危國的賭塲，姻窟再存在，而使和平區眞正能成爲一片明朗樂土。</p>

<h3>勝利的科學（五）</h3>
<p>日本在大東亞戰爭中，陸海軍所以取得大戰果的原因，不僅是將士英勇盡忠報國所致，且也不能不歸功於供給戰塲的飛機，坦克車，槍砲，各種優秀科學兵器，以及糧秣，藥品，建設器材等等。陸軍方面，對於這類勝利兵器的發明家曾頒發過第二次陸軍技術有功獎章，茲把到得獎章者，以及主要發明家介紹於次：（濤：譯自四月十七日東京每日新聞）</p>
<h3>關於光學鏡片製造的研究　…商工省大阪工業試騐所所長松享工科博士…</h3>
<p>高松氏生於久留米市西替一〇號，九州大學應用化學科畢業後，即入該所以迄於今，對於光　鏡片的苦心硏究已有二十餘年，在這次大戰中曾供獻給　空軍一種「索敵眼」。以前關於光學鏡片的製造技術，完全由德國一手包辦。該氏在九州大學讀書時，他認爲前次世界人戰德國在朱特蘭（Jutland）海戰中始終困惱英國的，就是因爲有優秀的測量距離的機器，於是高松氏　決定發奮硏究光學鏡片，以此爲自己的終身事業，且必須　到本國能製造這種器　的地步。有個時期，由於在有一千四百度的高熱爐的硏究室中，攝民寒署表竟達四十多度，完全如在蒸爐中，這樣繼續硏究了兩個星期，專心試騐透視鏡，而發明了不亞於德國品質良好的透視鏡「硼硅王冠」。最　又打破了一屯爐的製造透視一鏡方法而使用二屯爐。其價格要比以前的使宜八成至六成，且其品質優秀，製造容易簡便。</p>
<p>高松　　說：「光學鐿片差不多都由德國蕭特工塲獨占着，其製造方法非常神秘，雖然我們也可以買到這類物品，但　直不知這是　樣製成這樣高超的東西。幸而由於絞腦榨汁，按其裂造蹤跡努力追尋探索，竟達到不亞於德國最高製品的成績。當然這一成功決不是我一人所造成，是本試騐所第六部員共同一致的努力結晶，所以領到的賞金。我願意把牠當作有用的硏究費花掉。德國戰鬥艦畢斯麥號擊沉福特號，我認爲也是測騐距離機的優秀性所致。爲使在大東亞戰爭中獲得勝利，必須具有更更優秀的索敵眼。我決意堅持這種研究。」</p>
<p>穿釘結合法的大厦木造研究…建築技師上尉高山聲以及其他協力者…</p>
<p>因爲沒有鐵，沒有水泥而躊躇不前，這是沒有智慧的話。東鄉元帥常前軍編會議規定五五三海軍比例時說過，「訓練可無限制的吧！」這實在可以說，智慧，努力，堅持是無限制的。例如飛機格納庫，一向都用鋼骨作成，但同樣大小的格納庫竟用木料大量作成，目前使用着不僅沒有什麽不妥當的地方，且收到很大效果，道完全可以說，是　空本都建築技師高山上尉高深硏究的賜輿。</p>
<p>建築技師高山上尉完全克服了鋼鐵之不足現象。而完成了木造大格納庫。該上尉和協力者共同想把過去鋼骨製造的格納庫改良爲木造式，其接端則用釘子。然而這種結合法先從周密的科學分析開始，結果總還是折斷，折斷後再接起來，這樣繼續不斷的研究，終於完成了大厦間的穿釘結合法。現在由於這種結合法，已經建成壯麗的四十所大格納庫，以備陸軍　之使用。</p>
<p>這種建築所需要的鐵。每所比起二三十噸鐵造的來，只不過其一成不足，即十八噸。建築四十所簡直可以省八千五百噸鋼材，費用可省二五十萬圓，這眞是對於鋼鐵之絕大節的。此外還有根據這個觀點把最大四十公尺的鐵造廠房改爲四十二公尺的木造，也已成功，且在建築速度上比鐵造少三成，而費用只需鐵造的百分之六十五，這不能不說是一種奇蹟。</p>
<p>高山上尉等的這一大新發明，是週應軍政當局的要求而產生，同時也給民間以絕大好處。由於建築後三年的成績，向來「Volt」建築學會的戰時規格，也逐漸採用這種新方法。（完）</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>普設農倉的重</h3>
<p>際此非常時期，政府旣以安定民生爲重要國策之一，而安定民生，首貨充裕民食。欲充裕民食，積極的固重增加生產，消極的尤貴救饑備荒。是以普設倉儲，調劑盈虛，亦爲糧政的重要部份。我國在　　以前，各處農倉的設置，已具相當成績，惜近年以來，因時局未靖，多數停頓。最近聞糧食部有廣設農倉的計劃，自爲復興農村，解決民食的良策。</p>
<p>普設農倉，可就兩條途徑進行：第一，積極督促人民團體普遍組設，在未設置完備以前，得先行舉辦簡易農倉，以鄕村公　房屋祠廟或農家燥房屋，作爲糧食倉庫；所儲糧食，得商請當地金融機關，通融資金；伹其進倉出倉，均須受當地政府嚴密監督，以杜私囤營利之弊。務使農倉成爲人民應辦之公益事業，並應由政府予以相當的獎勵。</p>
<p>第二，由地方政府或糧食調節機關將事變前舊有的農倉，趕速設法恢復，並於其他適當地點，酌　增設，辦理糧食的收購，加工，存儲，及運銷等等，藉以調劑盈虧，平衡價格。最好更能調查各地糧食的存儲　和需要量，由糧食有餘的地方，儘量供給不足的地方。並許農民以儲押方法，通融農業生產　資金。庶幾農倉的效用，不　爲靜的儲藏，且爲動的調　。不僅爲消極備荒之需，且爲積極增產之助。所以，普設農倉，富爲當今之急務。</p>
<p>交通銀行</p>
<h3>積極辦理農貸確定　農業金融業務大綱　先就京蘇蘇嘉等地爲農貸重心區</h3>
<p>交通銀行爲發展全國實業之銀行，對於農業放款，原已列爲主要業務之一。該行自奉財實兩部令舉辦農村貸款後，即經先後派員分赴蘇浙皖三省及京滬兩特別市各縣實地調查農村經濟狀况，並根據調查結果，依照政府國策，及參照各國農業銀行經營農業金融業務前例，詳爲硏討，特擬訂辦理農業金融業務及各種貸款具體辦法大綱，爰於日前在總行內添設農業經濟處，專責辦理農業金融業務，茲分誌各情如下：</p>
<p>首次調查農村結果</p>
<p>該行奉令舉辦農村貸款，遵經先後派員分赴蘇浙皖三省及京滬兩特別市各縣，實地調查農村經濟狀况。結果僉以目前農產價格雖高，但各項農用品日用品價格尙高於農產品，一般小戶佃農，缺乏經營資金，情形甚爲普遍，多數無力購買肥斜飼料，影響生產至鉅，値茲大東亞戰爭之時物資生產，實　刻不容緩之舉，農田經營，亟應從粗放改爲集約，故農村需要資金之融通，確屬急切，對於農村貸款，擴大進行，期與政府實雄戰時經濟政策綱領，積極增產之旨，確相適應。</p>
<p>辦理農業業務大綱</p>
<p>該行爲遵照政府意旨，趕速籌辦農貸起見，特於行內添設農業經濟處，並派張恩錦爲處長，梁定蜀，符滌塵爲副處長，專責辦理農業金融業務，然此項業務性質特殊，與普通一般銀行業務不同，因係推進農業經濟政策，及爲完成樹立農村金融新制度與機構之使命，決不以營利爲目的，故該行除已擬訂農業金融業務規程及各種貸款規則，呈請政府核示，並給予特許專辦等權，由政府指導監督進行外，特依照政府國策，及各地實際情形，並參照各國農業銀行經營農業金　業務前例，詳爲研討，確定今後業務大綱：（一）改善農村經濟狀况，（二）增加農業生產量，並協助農業推進與推廣，（三）輔導農民，樹立自有自營自亨之金融制度與金融機構，（四）扶掖樹立自耕農。</p>
<p>農貸重心進行步</p>
<p>該行將於最近期內，即將開始第二次農村經濟確實調查，一俟調查工作完竣後，即根據實地情形，先就南京，蕪湖，蘇州，嘉興等地爲農貸重心區，侯後逐漸擴展四大重心區附近各縣鎭鄉村，其進行步驟，在開始辦理之第一二年內，擬先看重於農村信用及生產合作放款，增加小農戶農田經營資金，以提高每畝生產量及純收益，務使農田經營，由粗放而改爲集的，使農民生活日形充裕，而農村經濟狀況亦因以改善，一二年後俟合作基礎穩固，即進而輔導成立各縣市合作金庫，及協助成立附屬於合作系統之各級農業會庫，使合庫制度，與農倉網圓滑配合。</p>
<h3>日總領館舉行　物資統制連絡會議</h3>
<p>日本總領事館，爲制止日人違反統制行爲起見，經濟課警察已決定，每月舉行一次日人物資統制違反行爲對策連絡會議。曾於本月十四日假該館五樓會議室，舉行第一次會議，商討關於日人有違反行爲者之處罰等問題。</p>
<h3>各業公會動態</h3>
<p>本市各業同業公會，奉令調整機構，以適應戰時體制，各種主要物品之公會，一部份業已先後成立，尙有次要物品之各業公會，亦以奉令籌備，茲將各業公會之動態，彙集如后：</p>
<p>鐵銅公會</p>
<p>鐵銅業同業公會，業經經濟局指定張浩如蔣貴慶等爲發　人，已成立籌　會，開始辦理籌備事宜，並辦理會員登記入會，原有之鐵業鋼條舊織業兩公會，亦經指令合併，上述二公會之會員，亦須加入該會，於今（十七）日起，辦理入會登記手續。</p>
<p>絲綢聯會</p>
<p>又絲繭業聯合會，原奉令於籌備中，茲又奉實部特種商品運銷管理局令，因對絲綢一業之由實部指定發起人選着手籌備，而絲繭性質與絲綢相同，且絲繭聯合會又與新頒法令未盡符合，應即停止籌備，故該會業已停止組織，且合併於絲綢聯會，由蔡聲白等負責籌備，並規定各地區之絲繭絲綢製售產銷各業公會，均須尅日加入該會爲會員，以資統一會務。</p>
<p>橡膠公會</p>
<p>本市橡膠製造業同業公會，業　奉令組織積極籌備，且於今（十七）日起至廿日止，辦理會員登記三天，凡屬本市橡膠製造廠商，均須依法加入，以維業務權益。</p>
<p>電器廠業</p>
<p>本市電器廠業同業公會，已經經濟局指定葉友才等負責籌備，限期於本月廿日前完成具報，故即日起辦理會昌登記，凡本市電機電綫　燈泡無綫電雷筒電木電池小電珠等，一切有關電器業之大小廠商，不論以前曾否入會，均須辦理入會登記，至本月十九日截止。</p>
<h3>滬市上週間金融工商市況</h3>
<p>上海金融與工商市况，上週間疲勢依然存在，人心安定，前途頗抱樂觀，因（一）政府當局對於澈查投機囤積將擴大範圍認眞執行，囤積商大起恐慌，求脫心切，故過去物資被擁資囤儲至市面需求缺乏現象完全消除。（二）銀根吃緊，中央儲備銀行分行爲協助國府取締投機抑平物價，現從事停止同業放款收縮已放舊款，各行莊對往來客戶放款均在緊縮中，因此游資不易流入投機囤積國內。（三）商統會雖在積極促成下部機構組織，但對於物資統制，尤着重於交流圓滑化，同時各行莊有力者嚴重注意於農村放款，使農村經濟之靈活，而增加農產，放在一致樂覜下，金融平定，工商逐漸推展，市價公定者不動，即非公定之黑　買賣價格，亦俱趨平低。</p>
<p>粉糰公會</p>
<p>又前上海市，　業同業公會麵奉命改組爲上海區粉糰業同業公會，並經指定羅海濤等負責籌備，限期成立，凡本市經營之湖北幫粉　商店，均須入會，並辦理麵粉米油糖碱山芋粉等登記。</p>
<p>化學品業</p>
<p>上海特別市化學工粱品業同業公會業經經濟局指定尉邦俊等七人發起籌備組織條後，昨經台開第一次籌備會議即席議決要案：（一）公推周邦俊　籌備主任（二）着手擬訂章程草案（三）聘任人事等要案並聞該會包括業務爲化妝品廠商，油墨廠商，火油廠商均得請求入會，不日將登報公吿辦理會員重行登記。</p>

<h3>我們等待事實表現</h3>
<p>— 盛大源</p>
<p>因了奸商囤積居奇，操縱物價，而處於水深火熱的煎熬中的我們，在五月四日的報上看到國防會議通過的囤積商品治罪條例，眞有在大早中望見雲霓之感。尤其是這次所定罰則之嚴厲，更使我們看出政府的決心。然而在欣喜之餘，又不禁起了憂懼。事實吿訴我們，所定的條例雖然嚴厲，但執行者是人，在執行時所一定會遭遇的困難，是在想像中的。雲霓會不會終於是雲霓而止，不見雨點，或僅僅是幾點無濟於事的小雨呢？我們切望着事實的表現。</p>
<p>不久之前當局雷厲風行的調查銀　賬簿，取締投機，結果是一家早通銀行和一位韓拱北受了處分。當然這是百分之百應該的事，然而令人生了「大魚不捉捉小魚」之想，同時來了無數的傳說。這次國防會議　過的條例是上次調查取締的延續，而且顯然是進了一步，這我們當然欣喜，然而我們更希望有使民衆歡欣的事實做出來，而且愈快愈好，因爲實在受不住了。</p>
<p>五月四日道條例發表後，當日的物價就趨跌了。這證明壓平物價是可能的，只要做。然而優厚的非法利潤之所在，投機囤積者當然會不惜任何手段，想盡方法來逃避法令，或取巧舞弊的。所以在執行這條例的時候，政府實在需要大多數人的協力與監督。日文大陸新報所發表的「强化國府與囤積問題」一文中，已說過「囤積是遂行新經濟政策的最大障碍。我們不惜再三再四的論及，無論如何不會嫌說得太多的。」希望全上海的報紙雜誌，一致對政府執行這一條例，作監督，檢舉，和聲援。使一切囤積者無所遁形，執行者也無從怠忽或循情。這樣，囤積者是末日不遠，而大衆却得救了</p>
<h3>強化國府與囤積問題（六）</h3>
<p>上面已經把民族資本分類述過，又將民族資本與囤積的關係，加以批判，這裏再來檢討一下現在租界各種企業與囤積的關係，目下在租界上有句流行話，叫做：「設廠不如開店，開店不如囤貨」，聽這兩句話，就可透視現在畸形的和界經濟大半情形，不論生產怎樣不振，現在租界上還是現出投資黃金時代，况且上海的現狀之下，投資早失去了木來的正常意義，投機與投資　兩件事，簡直不容易區別，考慮到這種　情，就來批判一下銀行，企業公司，保險公司，各種工廠的活動狀况，從批判之中，提起了國府應該如何取締投機，如何澈查投機，而如何求得加强國府與安定民生之道。</p>
<p>銀行與囤積問題大東亞戰爭以來，小銀行如爾後春筍的開設出來，當發生囤積問題的前後，本報已詳細提出，羣小銀行之整理合併問題，這次阜　銀行雖爲囤積問題被懲，可是幹囤積行爲的斷不止一二銀行，用客觀眼　去觀察，大多數銀行，其設立動機，資金，存款與利益的現狀及其他，直接間接都富有囤積的可疑。</p>
<p>例如三百萬資金的小銀行，假使所有的資本完全去做工業放款乃至農業放軟，恐怕其所得利潤，還不够維持其銀行的開支，再則小銀行縱使吸收巨額存款，然而就現在存款的一般趨勢觀之，可以斷定祗有活期存款占最多數，那末單靠放款，那裏能維持開支營業呢？這是很明白的道理，况且開設小銀行的動機，本夾不當作正常金融機關去開，來做正常金融資本活動的，不過借銀行作幌子，去追求厚利的商業利潤·然而他們體會過事變以來的經騐，知道最大的商業利潤，祇有做囤積才能獲得。</p>
<p>而小銀行自己做囤積，或使別人去做的塲合，憑其少數資金，決計做不了大規模囤積，由於此種實情，小銀行又產生了介於大銀行與囤戶中間調度囤積資金機關的性質，就大銀行力面來說，自從去年公佈取締金融機關的商業行爲命令後，已經不容評明目張胆的去做，假使要想在商業上獲利，倒不得不借重不列於金融機關的商業機關乃至小銀行，於是使銀行皆大囤積，成了囤秋的金融兵站。</p>
<p>企業公司與囤積問題大小企業公司，超過五百餘家，這句話小知說了　多遍，而五百餘家左右的企業公司，多在去年公佈金融機關取　令前後開設出來的，明明是銀行經商的別動機關，一　人者是這樣見解，在企業公司之中，當然也有相當長久歷史的有力企業公司，不是投機果團內的公司，可是嚴裕的來論，可以肯定企業公司是利用人民對它信仰而介在銀行與企業之問幹其投機性質的商業行爲之集團。</p>
<p>在近代工業發展的世界各國，也有托辣斯，企業合同的形態，在近代工業落後的中國，也已結成了托辣斯，企業聯盟，企業合同的形態，不過中國的企業公司與針項組織不同，多數趁着收買工廠，搜購華股，及其他特殊現象而經營投機，它用同一的形式對工廠投資，以集中管理爲目的，所以這也可以斷其有多量投機囤積作用。</p>
<p>然而企業公司的有力者，都由租界第一流財界巨擘來任經理或董事長等要職，且均以有力銀行爲背景，密切合作，其今後的動向奧夫對此之取締乃至使其正當發展，較囤積事件發生後更爲人注目。（雲鵬：續譯大陸新報）</p>

<h3>六年來都市生活的感想</h3>
<p>— 凌祖仁</p>
<p>遠在　省的　　，最近　　來，要我吿訴他一些六年來對於「都市生活」的感想，並且，還說了不少羨慕我的話，弦外之音，似乎對於這國際的大都市—上海，着實的愛戀呢！不　，我却對他這般的說：</p>
<p>……凡是一件鮮明的物象或者事跡，擺在您面前時，起先您總是熱烈的愛好它的，但是，假使它一直的不變更它的形象和素質，而永是保持着它一貫的情調，那末，漸漸的您對於它會厭倦的，生活，何嘗不是如此呢！</p>
<p>當然，在我未來這都市時，我眞也同您現時一般的愛戀它的。但是，經過六年的友誼，我却慚漸的對於這位老朋友，感得平淡無奇了，眞像一顆傍晚的落日那般的，已消失去了它先前强烈光輝的最高潮。</p>
<p>雖然，那些雄偉的廿世紀釣現代建築—高聳的洋樓，和寬坦的街道，還是把這都市，建築在繁華和麗都的基點上，依舊値得禮讚，可是，在我，它給我的印象，已像是冲淡了的一杯咖啡一般。</p>
<p>您暫時或許不會信任我的話，但是，假使您以後有機會，而也來這都市裏生活幾年的話，您就會憶念到我這些話的。</p>
<p>或許像我這樣平凡的一個人，在我現時度着的一種平凡的生活方式裏，是沒有能力可以來獲得「都市生活」優點的蘊藏的。</p>
<p>的確，對於這都市裏的生活上的優點，我是够糢糊的。</p>
<p>或許，那些物質享受的舒適，和聲色犬馬的追求，就是「都市生活」的優點吧！不過，這種優點，却僅是呑沒了不少人的信譽和前途，您或許也理會到這一層的優點吧！所以，您總是担心着我或許也會給它誘惑的。</p>
<p>是的，在這都市裏的一些靑年，誰能够把握住不被誘惑的確定的信念呢？靡靡之音的爵十音樂，軟玉溫香，朱脣白腿的姑娘，媚的眼波，水蛇般的腰肢，是够膩人的呢！麥　閙，台而蒙咖啡，是有着濃烈的香味的呢！</p>
<p>快狐步，華爾滋，福克斯，勃羅斯，…美的旋律呀！這裏，我小想把文字來佈放巧妙的烟幕，而蒙蔽事實，我也會被這種美的旋律支配過的呢！</p>
<p>一年，二年，三年，…六年了，我生活在這些都市的優點裏，論理，我該禮　這「都市生活」的，但是呀！它的優是在那裏；美在那裏？我還不理解的，或許是我太愚蠢了一點。</p>
<p>在短短的幾千個字裏，要我來完詳地說明六年來　於都市生活的感想。那當然是不很可能的，但是，我却給它一個結論：「都市生活」，在我個人方面感得它是平淡的，不是理想的美滿生活。</p>
<p>當然呵！當您讀到我這些話時，也該深　地失望的吧！………</p>
<h3>憶魏金枝先生</h3>
<p>— 張心鵑</p>
<p>憶起了魏金枝先生，我的腦海里便浮起一個髴平頂，蓋小鬍髭，打紹興官話的「魯迅風」人物的影子來。</p>
<p>魏金枝是魯迅先生的私淑弟子，他個人是非常崇拜魯迅先生的，而魯迅光生也贊許他是一位優秀的農民文學作家。他和魯迅先生同鄉，他不但外貌上和魯迅相　，就是文章筆調也刻意揣摩魯迅。魏先生向來只寫小說，作品並不多，編成集子的有「奶媽一」，「白旗手」，「七封書信的自傳」等。</p>
<p>魏先生有過一個很長的時期在麥倫中學担任敎席，那時，筆者正在麥倫肄業，魏先生是我們的國文和歷史敎員。他的性格非常剛强，脾氣爽直，喜歡當面駡人，從不在人後放冷箭說人短長，這是魏先生可愛之處，所以同學都敬畏他。</p>
<p>因爲魏先生是紹興人，說起話來腔調是頗滑稽的，他的音急促而短，因此常引得滿堂鬨笑。同學們老愛摹仿他的口氣——「太監討老婆要殺格拉」，相互打趣。有時候我們和他談　魯迅作品，他搖着頭笑笑道：「你們年靑，還不了解魯迅。魯迅的文章你們還看不懂。」聽他的口氣，彷彿我們看魯迅作品還不够資格。</p>
<p>一九三七年魏先生娶了太太，結婚典禮是在麥倫中學大禮堂舉行的。那天我沒有去觀禮。聽說她也是一位作家，姓甚名誰我都不知道，緣慳一面，她的外表如何，那我更不知道了。</p>
<p>八一三前後，我祗在「魯迅風」上看到他的一篇短篇小說「王太太的掙扎」。之後，一直再不會見過他的作品，聽說他最近用「魏尼庸」的筆名，在社會日報上寫了一篇文言的小說，不知確否。</p>
<p>現在他放棄了敎書的工作，從商去了。他永遠抱定的主張，是不願意在任何塲合里勉强工作，也不願意做任何一件他所不願意做的事。當我草這篇粗淺不通的小文時，他正不知道在哪里奔波呢。</p>
<h3>詩人的悲哀</h3>
<p>— 宋濂</p>
<p>鵠形而細長，曾受了敎育的毒，這年輕人，很少有成功的份兒了。</p>
<p>不錯，文學是毫無能爲的東西，長久附庸的寄生物，一切空動事業的領袖，戰爭的時候是這樣，和平的時　也是道樣，現在是這樣，將來也是這樣。人類的藝術是賺錢，造槍砲，製飛機造瘋人，決不是扭紐揑揑一枝筆幹所能了的事。</p>
<p>然而幹了文學又怎樣呢！他跟別的人類一樣，要吃飯，要娶妻，也畏冷，也得睡，甚致於更忙的時候，甚致於最消極的時候。論成績，在學校的時候，那他是不落後的，然而方出學校，他就喪失了搖搖擺擺的勁兒，被擠在「生」的尾巴上，稍爲用一用力，就會被甩出十萬八千里外的。</p>
<p>他老是不懂他的朋友，恁的他們會這樣安閒。論發表的東西吧，並不多；論努力的程度吧，似乎也不如他。這將是神秘的謎他能不能探一探呢，他能不能學一學呢！嗯！他眞不懂，眞不懂！</p>
<p>牆上纏滿了籐葉，碧油油的一片窗口開的老高，要是白天被太陽一照眩耀的簡直找不出那地方是窗口。爲了要更顯得神秘一點窗玻璃用的是敎會式，黃的，紅的，靑的，橙的，叫人回溯了三四千年前巴比倫城的偉大建築「空中花園」，憧憬着思慕着，却永遠不能明瞭一個確數。</p>
<p>這是×××名詩人的住宅。</p>
<p>詩人當然是無處脫不了詩意的，頭髮蓬鬆是詩意，說話乖巧是詩意，用錢闊綽是詩意，褲子穿的發亮是詩意。而尤其詩意的當然是靈感來的時候，把窗關了，叫陽光透過雜色的玻璃瀉在寫字檯上，我們的詩人掠一掠頭髮，坐下來寫他大作的時候。</p>
<p>這位鵠形的靑年現在就打算來請敎這樣個漂亮的人物，雖然他們是同學，然而靑蛙見了，總小免往田畦裏竄啊！</p>
<p>消瘦的人影開始在漂亮的牆足下徘徊了。月亮吐着凄淡的光，對於這兩個表面上懸殊的人物也顯有不勝感慨系之的神情。</p>
<p>兩對目　終於接　了，一個是煞神似的，一個是幽靈似的，詩人把個亂槽糟的頭塞出窗口：</p>
<p>「誰呀，摸摸索索的該不有好打算吧。」</p>
<p>「不！我，闡明！」</p>
<p>「…………」</p>
<p>詩人在寫詩，把張緋色的信箋上疏疏落落地用綠墨水塡上幾行。旁邊還放着七八張方玻璃傘頭的信封，上面一式地塡着「陶爾斐斯路M新村A字一號胡雲芝小姐」。</p>
<p>詩人趕快收起了信箋，可是有幾行已經洩流了牠們的風光：</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>寒夜—：</p>
<p>我想望着你那星星的眼，</p>
<p>愛神微笑着，</p>
<p>土地直是興嘆：</p>
<p>執拗的人類啊</p>
<p>爲了你，</p>
<p>我擔了多少的寒。</p>
<p>爲了你</p>
<p>我歷盡了幾多茁張你的苦難</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>「詩人，就是這點而已嗎！我還虧你擔得起「民間詩人」的頭銜」。消瘦的人兒這一面勇氣百倍！</p>
<p>詩人的回答是暗示地向臺上信封打一眼，他再緩慢地從抽屜裏抽出來一件東面，展露在來客面前—：</p>
<p>「上月份稿費總結：五十七元！」</p>
<p>把筆桿劃出阻梗塞喉口的話語：「明天在××報上我給你另一份東西看」。</p>
<p>明天，帶着惡油味的報紙上，眞的明淸地印着：</p>
<p>「……………………</p>
<p>寒夜—：</p>
<p>我直望着—</p>
<p>乞兒的眼，</p>
<p>星星冷笑着</p>
<p>土地祗是興嘆：</p>
<p>執拗的人類啊</p>
<p>爲了你</p>
<p>我擔了多少的寒。爲了你，我歷盡了幾多茁張你的苦難。</p>
<p>………………</p>
<p>他這才明白了詩人的悲哀，詩人的費用斷不能單只靠這五十七元，他再計算着自己的進益，唔！皇天究竟不是沒有眼。</p>
<h3>「新」女性素描</h3>
<p>— 金如霆</p>
<p>獻給W</p>
<p>已經十點多鐘了，起先是在窗外張望的陽光，現在大膽地蹓了進來靜靜躺在窗前。樓下高聲響着娘姨們議論小菜的聲音。</p>
<p>梅小姐還披着一件睡衣，在鏡子前捲梳她的頭髮——她那末坐了足足一個鐘頭，然而實際上，與其說她是在梳頭，不如說她是在端詳自己的臉蛋兒，發掘美麗的綫條。</p>
<p>「好漂亮的……」丢下了鉗子，呆望着自己的臉兒，她輕輕呼道，這時候隨着躊躇滿志的欣喜，一種受了奚落的忿怨襲上了她的心頭。——</p>
<p>昨天，爲了她的婚事，家裏謂客；「新郞」是××銀行的張協理，才二十五歲。</p>
<p>「門當戶對結高親，孩子是有出息的，門第又淸高……」晚上客人散去後，父親搖着大肚子，滿意地稱贊。</p>
<p>「是的，那孩子眞所誚文質彬彬，坐得端端正正的，對談起來又極文雅……」母親應和着：「你大槪沒有注意吧？他的一根鼻樑生得筆直的……」這是母親特到的發現。</p>
<p>「總之，福相，有出息！」父親打下了結論，無疑的，他已經同意了這段婚姻。</p>
<p>可是，梅小姐的評價，却和他們正相反，照理，她是一個廿世紀四十年代的摩登小姐，她有着前進的，合潮流的新思想，自然不會和她們迂腐的見解同意的。</p>
<p>「該死的，壽頭碼子！」在她，做夢也不會想到：會有這末一段婚事落在她的身上。首先，她對於「月老說媒，請客介紹」這一套就壓根兒地討厭；「什麽說媒介紹！難道憑我這末摩登的女性，會沒有人愛上我，向我求愛！」並且，照她往日的幻想，「如意郞君」應該是如此和她結合在一起：譬如，春光明媚，百花齊放的時候，她倚着窗口，低唱起甜蜜的戀歌；不知什麼一來，他那宏亮的歌聲高揚了，於是他倆擁抱起來，於是託了終身……其次她以爲她的愛人，將必定會像厄洛爾福林或者劉瓊那樣的魁梧；她常常幻情　着羅曼諦克的圖畫：她的愛人忽然抱緊了她，躍上雄偉的馬，疾馳而去，至於爲什麽要疾馳而去，那她還沒有想到，總之她的愛人決不會，也不應該那樣平淡，穿着長衫，像個小老頭；同時他倆也不會這樣平淡地結合。——一切都不够浪漫。</p>
<p>「他那想配得上我？」她站直了，扔開手中的木梳；臉上浮起譏刺的冷笑：「媽媽他們思想落伍！眼界狹小！」</p>
<p>這樣，對於自己站立着的，美好的姿態欣賞了一會兒，走向窗前的書桌來。照她每天的習慣，梳好頭，就開始給明星的照片著色，——上午就這末完了，相片著角是一種了不得的藝術，所以無論學校裏月考，大考，這門必修的藝術課她是決不間斷的。</p>
<p>今天，她的工作是繼續完成狄愛娜實萍的歌唱照片，蘸了些口紅色，她當心地著上了那張微啟着的小嘴，突然，她若有所悟似地站起了，軍新跑到鏡子前面，徵張開了嘴，揣摹着嬌憨的樣子。</p>
<p>「和竇萍一樣的美好！」感到了滿足，於是安心回到了書桌邊埋頭工作了。</p>
<p>「媽媽叫你吃飯去，姐姐！」弟弟的聲音，他不知是從那個時候起，站立在身旁的。</p>
<p>「知道了，就來！」淡淡地，依舊在嚴肅地工作。</p>
<p>「姐姐，這是預備送給誰的？」</p>
<p>「你別管！」似乎已經不耐煩了。</p>
<p>「給我看看好嗎？」弟弟柔聲地請求，伸過手來。</p>
<p>「別動！」攔住他的手。</p>
<p>「給我看看又有什麽關係？」</p>
<p>「不給你看，怎麽啦！」</p>
<p>「非看不可！」弟弟也不示弱，索性强搶了。</p>
<p>浪漫的女藝術家是不好惹的，她光了火重重捶了他一下：「滾出去，我的房間裏不許你進來！」</p>
<p>「好！你打我！我去吿訴媽！』弟弟使勁撕破了喉嚨，硬聲大哭了，倔强地跑下樓去。</p>
<p>接着，母親在樓下大聲喊道：「梅，你爲什麽打弟弟！媽還沒有死呀！弟弟不對，你可以來吿訴的；他輪不着你打！」</p>
<p>「偏偏要打！」</p>
<p>「啊呀！你怎麼這樣沒有規矩！……我對你說，在媽面前使脾氣是沒有關係的！過兩天，到了張家，依舊是這個性子，人家婆婆是不會原諒你的！」母親愛叨了一大套，領着弟弟上樓來！</p>
<p>「什麼張家！我會要這種男人！」</p>
<p>「什麼？你在說……」母親大驚小怪地。</p>
<p>「沒有什麽！我不要！」</p>
<p>「梅，女孩子不應該這末潑辣！張家的婚事由我做主，沒有你的話！」睡在三樓的父親被閙醒了，他的沈濁的聲音像一塊大石似地壓下來，有着莫大的重量。</p>
<p>「我不要！」父親的駡聲溶解了她那倔强的辯詞，可是，這很快就化成了眼淚，她大哭起來，倒在床上。</p>
<p>「不要！也得要！」父親一點也不憐惜她。</p>
<p>梅小姐哭着，哭着，——除了給明星照片着色，這該是她專門的藝術了！母親曾來勸誘她幾次，然而給這溫柔撫摸的回答，只是不耐煩的喝斥！於是摸得出女兒脾氣的母親索性避開了她！</p>
<p>起先，她不停地詛咒姓張的，父親，母親和弟弟……後來漸漸覺得疲倦了，她長嘆了一聲，擦擦因爲哭泣而張緊着的眼皮；她的全身慢慢鬆弛了。</p>
<p>「這就是所謂對建！」她驀地一驚，接着，不然而然地，她聯想起了蝴蝶夫人裏的陳燕燕；這是封建勢力的犧牲者，這時候，她不禁得意起來；不過，畢竟她和蝴蝶夫人相像的地方太少了，她不是一妓女那先不用說，根本她就沒有劉瓊那末Smart的情人。這未免有點掃興。於是，她想到恨不相逢未嫁時，洞房花燭夜，那兒的女主角都合不上她。</p>
<p>「有了！我是春中的蕙！」最後，她終於抓到了人，喜出望外，大大地興奮了！什麼姓張的，父親斬釘截鐵的駡聲都拋之於九霄雲外了！——自己的命運會和電影裏的人物相同，該是够浪漫的事！</p>
<p>於是，她低唱起滿州姑娘來……</p>
<p>晚上，母親買來了許多糖果，消解她早上所受到的委屈，還延請了隔壁的方姑娘來作伴，她們倆談着，從陳燕燕的婚變談到高占非的來滬，又談到狄愛娜竇萍的結婚……</p>
<p>「我今天才着好一張狄愛娜竇萍的照片，你還沒有看見過！」說到這裏，梅小姐拉開抽屜，拿出那張照片來。</p>
<p>「可惜肉色上得太深了！」那個並不讚賞。</p>
<p>「那不見得……」梅小姐感到微微的惱怒，接着她又指着照片說：「你看這張嘴多美！」心裏期待着的回答是：「別說啦！你的比她更美好！」</p>
<p>「梅，我新近向陳雲裳討了一張親手簽名的照片，眞美呀！」方姑娘又不凑趣，離開了話題，誇耀地說。</p>
<p>「那有什麽希罕！寫封信到自明公寓就得啦！」梅小姐撅起了嘴，也不願意應和她。</p>
<p>「可是，她現在並不住在那兒了！」方姑娘笑了，「並且她現在不肯輕易給影迷照片！」</p>
<p>「誰說，沒有錯的，她還住在那兒！」梅不服氣。</p>
<p>「眞的，她搬了家！」</p>
<p>「瞎說，這是她放的「空氣！』」她尖聲嚷道，像是在爭辯一個嚴重的，切身的問題；心裏輕蔑地說：「無論如何，關於影圈裏的事，我總比你知道得多！」</p>
<p>「這不會是放的「空氣！」」方姑娘笑着說：「梅，這是我昨天買來的。——最新的樣式！」她指着脚下的皮鞋：</p>
<p>「沒有什麽好看！」梅小姐已經全然賭氣了！</p>
<p>談話合不在一起，不到十點鐘，方姑娘回家去了。</p>
<p>「是的，梅！你也可以睡了。別累了身子，明天張協理還要請你看電影呢！」母親送出了方姑娘，笑着勸她。</p>
<p>「不，我不去！」忸怩地。</p>
<p>「孩子！你又不聽話了！」</p>
<p>「我不去，我沒有鞋子！」抓住時機，提出了她的要求。</p>
<p>「前個月才買了一雙皮鞋，又說沒有鞋子了？」母親奇怪地問。</p>
<p>「那雙鞋子的樣子太老了，我要買方姑娘脚上穿的那種！」</p>
<p>「別閙啦！快睡去，過兩天再說！」母親暗暗答應了！</p>
<p>「不過，沒有鞋子，我不去！」她撒着嬌，內心回意地笑着——又多了一雙皮鞋！</p>

<h3>Petitioning for the People Suffering in the North China Famine</h3>
<p>"The province has suffered successive years of poor harvests, with last year being particularly severe. Now, at this time of year when the old grain is gone and the new has not yet arrived, grass roots and tree bark have been almost completely dug up and consumed. Suicides by hanging and jumping into ravines are frequently heard of. Yesterday, I went to inspect the area under the Donglin Circuit and found the land like a desert, with no water or vegetation. Witnessing such a tragic scene, my heart burned with grief. The telegrams from various places reporting the dire situation are largely the same." This is an excerpt from a report on the 10th of this month, quoting Shandong Governor Tang's urgent plea for disaster relief.</p>
<p>"It has been found that the disaster situation in the North this year is severe, and the people are unable to make a living. Rice bran and wheat chaff are treasures that sustain the lives of starving people." This is an explanation in a report from Wang Yintai, Supervisor of the North China Industrial Bureau, on the disaster situation in Shandong, Henan, and other provinces, as reported on the 10th of this month.</p>
<p>"Delicacies and fine wines that one never tires of eating and drinking, music and dances that one never tires of seeing and hearing, gardens and dance floors that one never tires of visiting." This is a sentence from an advertisement for a certain grand restaurant in this city, as reported on the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>What feelings will readers have after comparing these paragraphs? Shandong and Henan, like Shanghai, are both parts of China's land, and the people of the North and the people of Shanghai are all compatriots of the Republic of China. However, why is it that in the North, "grass roots and tree bark have been almost completely dug up and consumed," while Shanghai still has "delicacies and fine wines that one never tires of eating and drinking"? Shouldn't those in Shanghai who "never tire of eating and drinking," "never tire of seeing and hearing," and "never tire of visiting" show some concern for our suffering compatriots in the North? We firmly believe that every reader will answer that this is "a matter of course" and "absolutely right"! Not to mention that the disaster victims in provinces like Shandong and Henan are all our compatriots, even if they were foreigners, we should inherit the teachings of our ancient sages and virtuous men, "treat the drowning as if we were drowning ourselves, and treat the hungry as if we were hungry ourselves," and uphold the spirit of "embracing all people as our brothers and sisters," and do our best to donate aid.</p>
<p>According to news reports, the current government is very concerned about the unprecedented disaster situation in the provinces of North China, and the Ministry of Social Affairs is already preparing relief efforts. What we hope from the authorities in charge is that, under the premise of "disaster relief is like fighting a fire," they will quickly and effectively carry out relief work, on the one hand providing food for the disaster victims, and on the other hand preventing epidemics. They should further promote active measures to enable the displaced disaster victims to find places to settle down and gain employment, to prevent the disaster area from expanding, and to gradually reduce the severity of the disaster. The governments and relevant authorities in areas close to the disaster area should also do their best to provide shelter for refugees, and to provide organized and planned resettlement, relief, and employment guidance. Of course, we also hope that experts will work hard to devise methods to prevent natural disasters, and cooperate with the government to prevent future calamities.</p>
<p>However, the most urgent matter is the immediate relief of millions of disaster victims in the vast disaster areas of Henan and Shandong provinces in North China. If this problem is not immediately addressed through joint efforts, the impact will not only be on North China, but will inevitably affect other regions as well. Furthermore, the solution to the problem cannot rely solely on government agencies, but requires the urgent relief efforts of people across the country. Currently, fellow North China natives residing in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places, as well as prominent figures in the private sector, have already consulted with the Ministry of Social Affairs and are voluntarily organizing a North China Emergency Relief Association to assist the government in handling fundraising and relief matters. We deeply believe that this is a righteous act that deserves active promotion. However, compatriots in provinces other than North China, especially those in all circles of Shanghai, should step forward bravely and advocate for relief efforts everywhere. In the past, Shanghai's charitable organizations, philanthropists, and social leaders have always been in a leading position in national disaster relief efforts. They have all left behind glorious records. At this time of unprecedented disaster in North China, they should step forward again, cooperate, and work together to raise funds, in order to supplement the government's efforts and demonstrate the great righteousness of mutual assistance among compatriots. We further suggest: (1) North China natives and organizations in Nanjing should contact North China natives and organizations in Shanghai to work together. (2) North China native organizations in Shanghai should contact various charitable organizations and civic welfare organizations in Shanghai to discuss joint action. (3) Government agencies in charge, such as the Ministry of Social Affairs, should jointly lead and promote with the Shanghai Municipal Government. Propaganda, fundraising, and collection of funds should all be decided upon in a unified manner to achieve rapid results.</p>
<p>The most important thing for the emergency relief of disaster victims in North China is to ask for the voluntary donations of Shanghai citizens. Shanghai's economic situation may not be as good as before, but compared to other parts of the country, it is still one of the wealthiest regions. Considering that Shanghai has four million citizens, at least one million people have the ability to donate ten yuan per month, so ten million yuan per month should be the minimum target. In reality, there are still many wealthy people who are capable of donating one thousand or even ten thousand or more per month. We firmly believe that most of today's rich people are deeply aware of righteousness and will automatically make large donations without the need for solicitation. Although the colleagues of this newspaper are in difficult circumstances, we have勉强凑集 gathered five thousand yuan to fulfill our national obligations and take the lead in advocating for relief. At the same time, we are willing to collect donations from all walks of life for the disaster victims in North China. We sincerely hope that readers will show compassion and empathy, and generously contribute. We will collect the funds and hand them over to the organizing group.</p>
<p>At the same time, we sincerely hope that leaders from all walks of life and charitable organizations will carry out fundraising campaigns in a planned manner, striving to reach the minimum target of ten million yuan in the shortest possible time. In addition to voluntary donations from all walks of life, we hope that major restaurants, major restaurants, and major entertainment venues will voluntarily donate all or part of their profits for one or several days. In addition, we also hope that all sectors will work together on charity sales in the business community, charity football games, charity horse racing, etc.</p>
<p>In short, at present, disaster victims in North China fill the fields, and hundreds and thousands of people die every day. If we Shanghai citizens can save a little on food, then let alone ten million, even a larger number is not difficult. Moreover, the righteousness of our Shanghai compatriots will surely inspire the hearts of the people throughout the country, so the effectiveness of mutual assistance among compatriots will surely eliminate the disaster situation at an early date. This will have a great significance for the future of the country!</p>

<h3>The Taihang Mountain War Zone Expands: Japanese Troops Advance Towards the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway Line; The Encirclement Net Near Junji Pass is Completed, Launching Fierce Attacks on the Communist Troops in the Deep Mountains</h3>
<p>Taiyuan, Shanxi, 16th (Central News Agency): Since the Japanese army's elite units launched the Taihang Mountain operation, they have repeatedly demonstrated astonishing power. Within less than ten days, they shattered the Chongqing army and then turned their attack to encircle the headquarters of the Communist 18th Group Army and Liu Bocheng's 129th Division. They also captured the communist base areas of Matian Town and Zhi County. Now, they are encircling and suppressing the communist troops hiding in the mountains north of Junji Pass, completing a clever encirclement net and launching fierce attacks. The local Japanese military authorities announced at noon today that the Japanese army has expanded the Taihang Mountain war zone and began attacking communist troops south of the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan railway line starting on the 15th.</p>
<p>Taiyuan, Shanxi, 16th (Central News Agency): After completing the encirclement of the communist anti-Japanese camp in the dangerous areas of the Taihang Mountains on the 15th, the Japanese army's elite units began to destroy the communist organization and are gradually tightening the encirclement. As of noon on the 16th, the battle situation is as follows: Japanese units advancing north from the vicinity of Zhi County reached the vicinity of Junji Pass on the 13th, crushing all the Chongqing and communist troops in the area. By the 15th, 22 bodies of Chongqing and communist troops were found, and 12 people were captured. The Japanese army seized 17 rifles, 212 rounds of ammunition, 4 pistols, 10 hand grenades, and 30 bayonets, and then continued their attack. The Japanese troops advancing from the north echoed this and defeated a part of the Pinghan guerrilla unit under the Chongqing 129th Regiment southeast of Xiyang on the afternoon of the 14th, and then continued to attack about 100 Chongqing troops in Changjiangte, 15 kilometers to the east, capturing 25 people, seizing 9 rifles, 150 rounds of ammunition, and 20 military horses before continuing south.

<h3>Japanese Troops in Northern Hunan Expand Their Gains: The Chongqing Army's Retreat Route is Cut Off; Japanese Air Force Fiercely Bombs Nuanshui Street</h3>
<p>Hankou, 16th (Central News Agency): The main road for the Chongqing army in Hunan has been cut off after the Japanese army annihilated the Chongqing 10th Army Group. As a result, the Chongqing army there is wandering in the mountainous triangle of Xiqi, Mengxi Temple, and Gong'an. The Japanese army's air force, in order to assist the ground offensive troops in annihilating the besieged Chongqing army, launched a large-scale operation on the morning of the 16th, fiercely bombing the Chongqing army crossing the river near Nuanshui Street, and strafing with machine guns, crushing them. Another Japanese air squadron also fiercely bombed a large force of the Chongqing army gathered near the Zhaikou area southwest of Nuanshui Street, inflicting heavy casualties. Because of the fierce air and ground attacks by the Japanese army, the Chongqing army has completely lost its will to fight, and it is expected that it will be completely annihilated within a day or two. Since the Japanese army launched the annihilation battle on the shore of Dongting Lake, it has only been ten days, and it has thoroughly shattered the Chongqing 29th Army Group and the 10th Army Group, totaling about nine divisions and 90,000 people. In terms of area, the Japanese army has controlled a vast area of 200 kilometers wide and 80 kilometers long from the southern shore of Dongting Lake, north of Yuanjiang, north of Anxiang Jinshi, to the vicinity of Xuandu. By advancing towards Changsha and Changde from here, they can establish a situation that puts Chongqing in a deadly position. Moreover, the Chongqing 6th War Zone has greatly reduced its strength after losing the two strongest army groups at the front, and has to ask Chongqing for help.</p>
<p>Hankou, 16th (Central News Agency): According to a telegram from the southern Hunan front line on the 12th, the Japanese army on the northern route of southern Hunan is pursuing the Chongqing army in the mountains and fields of Jiangnan, advancing like a hot knife through butter. After three days of fierce fighting near Dazhongyan, Shunlinjin, Mengxi Temple, and Pengjia Factory, they completely defeated about 2,000 people from the Chongqing "43rd Division," "327th and 128th Regiments," and a part of the "50th Division, 118th Regiment." In this battle, the Chongqing army left behind 650 bodies and 330 people were captured, including five generals and officers. The Japanese army seized 2 mortars, 6 heavy machine guns, 12 light machine guns, 120 rifles, 5 grenade launchers, 650 hand grenades, and 35 horses.</p>
<p>Hankou, 16th (Central News Agency): According to a telegram from the Hunan front line on the 16th, the Japanese army's northward troops encircled the Chongqing "118th Division" in the Jiangnan area. Since the evening of the 13th, they fiercely attacked the retreating Chongqing army at Pengjia Factory (35 kilometers southwest of Gong'an), defeating the headquarters of the Chongqing "118th Division." The division commander, Wang Yan, disguised himself and fled to Dayan (30 kilometers northwest of Feng County).</p>

<h3>Regular Implementation of Bonded and Supervised Transportation between Tianjin and Shanhaiguan</h3>
<p>Beijing, 16th (Central News Agency): Since the Greater East Asia War has progressed steadily, land transportation between China, Japan, and Manchukuo has become increasingly important. In the past, it was difficult to expect smooth freight transportation and increased transportation volume between the northern provinces and cities of China and Manchukuo due to the need to handle Sino-Manchurian customs affairs in Shanhaiguan. In view of this, the relevant authorities have been actively studying countermeasures and have now decided to implement a bonded transportation and supervised transportation system between Dalian, Tianjin, and Shanhaiguan. It is scheduled to be implemented from June 1st. The Tianjin Customs Superintendent issued a notice stating that bonded transportation of goods transported by rail to Tianjin previously required permission from the Shanhaiguan sub-customs. Starting from June 1st, import procedures can be handled at Tianjin Customs. In addition, supervised transportation to Shanhaiguan, which previously required permission from Tianjin Customs, can now be handled with export procedures at Tianjin Customs starting from June 1st. It is expected that the implementation of this method will not only eliminate the problem of freight transportation in Shanhaiguan, but also shorten the transportation time of goods, reduce accidents during transportation, reduce transportation costs, and simplify customs clearance procedures. In addition, trade control and exchange institutions in Tianjin can also greatly facilitate customs clearance procedures, so the benefits to all parties are not small.</p>

<h3>Implementation of National Health Movement in Japan to Strengthen National Physique and Spirit, Aiming to Complete the War</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) – Recognizing that strengthening the national physique and spirit is essential for completing the war, the Japanese authorities previously designated May 1st to 10th as the intensive period for the National Health Movement to thoroughly convey this message to the people. Throughout the country, various health promotion activities were held during this period, with the aim of not only improving the health of the people, but also of vigorously boosting national spirit to resolutely complete the war. The key points of this National Health Movement are six: (1) To elevate the spirit of the Japanese nation, (2) to strive for the thorough implementation of wartime life, (3) to increase production and encourage marriage, (4) to promote maternal and child health, (5) to protect the health of the people and prevent and eliminate tuberculosis and venereal diseases. It is imperative to rapidly and continuously increase the population in order to carry out the war. As the war prolongs, the number of war-related departments will inevitably increase, and each department will need people to manage it. Replenishing combat forces requires young people, increasing military production requires industrial fighters, and those involved in reconstruction and construction to strengthen the rear also need a healthy physique and spirit to shoulder the heavy responsibilities. This is necessary for national development, for achieving the ideal of constructing East Asia, and for the permanent survival of the nation. Therefore, Japan is simultaneously striving to ensure the regeneration of human resources in both quality and quantity. The main reason for launching this National Health Movement is precisely this. The Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan is mobilizing all state-related agencies, such as newspapers, magazines, radio, and television, as well as basic units of national organizations, such as neighborhood associations, schools, companies, and factories, to thoroughly implement this movement. Pulmonary tuberculosis, the so-called "disease of civilization," has been the target of the greatest efforts by the world's medical community to eradicate. Japan is also making various efforts to ensure manpower and enhance war capabilities. Young people, as important members of the military and industrial fighters, must be prevented from contracting the disease. Tuberculosis screening will be conducted, and health exhibitions will be held to encourage the prevention of tuberculosis. In order to quickly restore the health of early-stage patients, a national conference of sanatorium directors will be convened to establish "Health Promotion Residences" to benefit patients. Those who need treatment will be forced to seek medical attention. Furthermore, children are the future masters of the country, and efforts should be made to improve their health for the survival and development of the nation. Therefore, the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan will also hold children's training and infant screening sessions in various places to deepen public awareness. In order to protect mothers and pregnant women raising children, "Mother and Child Associations" and laboring mothers' conferences have been held to commend laboring mothers who have given birth to many children. A conference on childcare for national service will be held to popularize childcare knowledge. Pregnant and postpartum women will be given priority in the allocation of food and other essential supplies to protect the mother's body. After the launch of this movement, free physical examinations for pregnant women will be universally implemented to ensure the health of pregnant women. At the same time, in order to cultivate healthy bodies, martial arts training, exercise sessions, and walking events will be held throughout the country to train the national physique and spirit, with the aim of simultaneously enhancing intelligence, skills, and physical strength. In addition, Japan believes that increasing the population is a prerequisite for enhancing national strength. Therefore, taking advantage of the launch of this movement, sound marriages and appropriate early marriages will be encouraged, and standards for marriage age will be set at 25 years or older for men and 21 years or older for women. At the same time, various groups and neighborhood associations will mediate marriages. Furthermore, the Japanese authorities believe that war and life are closely intertwined during this wartime period, but prolonged tension in national life will inevitably affect the front lines. Therefore, it is necessary to thoroughly reform wartime life, starting with reforms in clothing, food, and housing, to cultivate a spirit of hardship and endurance. On the other hand, the goal is to cultivate courage, advancement, simplicity, and robust character. Street broadcasts and exercises are conducted, and neighborhood sports meetings are held using open spaces. Dr. Takata Yasuma, director of the Japanese National Research Institute, once said, "The ability to overcome poverty and hardship is the driving force for the permanent survival and development of a nation." Today, the survival of the Japanese people is based on this maxim of Dr. Takata, consolidating the determination and confidence to win, thoroughly reforming wartime life, and defeating the United States and Britain. This National Health Movement has just concluded, so it is impossible to expect immediate results, but its spiritual impact on the Japanese people is indeed profound. Although this movement has ended, the Japanese people are still moving forward every day, continuing to train their bodies with the aim of defeating the United States and Britain. As the war intensifies, the Japanese people's training of body and mind is becoming more thorough and fulfilling.</p>
<h3>British Forces Repeatedly Defeated in Burma, Soldiers Have Lost the Will to Fight, Maungdaw Endangered After the Fall of Buthidaung</h3>
<p>Hikkie, 16th (Central News Agency) – Since the fall of Burma, the British Indian Army has been deeply distressed and has been actively trying to recapture Hikkie. Recently, they have changed their past passive strategy of using Indian troops on the front lines and have instead used British troops as the first line of defense. Their main force is the 6th Brigade, the most elite of the British Indian Army. However, this attempt was cleverly defeated by the Japanese army, and Buthidaung, located 20 kilometers from India, has already been occupied by the Japanese army. According to a Reuters dispatch from Calcutta, Maungdaw on the Burma-India border is also in danger. A special dispatch from the London Times lists the reasons for the British Indian Army's defeat in attacking Hikkie as follows: (1) The British failed to capitalize on their initial advantage. (2) The rear supply was inadequate. (3) The Governor-General of India neglected land transport between India and Burma. The article particularly emphasizes the inadequacy of the rear supply, attempting to deflect responsibility for the British military defeat from the anti-Axis forces and the Indian people. However, according to investigations, the enemy has built a relatively flat motor road from Dombek to Maungdaw, west of the Mayu Mountains, and a solid post road along the eastern foot of the Mayu Mountains. In order to connect the rapid road with the military motor road, they have opened a post road across the mountains between Apawdine south (east of the Mayu Mountains) and Burma-India. However, this was conveniently used by the Japanese army as a route of attack. The enemy has built field hospitals to defend against the rainy season in Khabakupe, and food warehouses in Indian and Kizzo. In addition, supply organizations have been set up in various important locations. From all this, it can be seen that the reason for the British Indian Army's defeat is still due to the loss of morale after repeated and rapid defeats, and the long-simmering mutual friction between the British and Indian troops has now surfaced.</p>
<h3>Name Changes in Japanese-Occupied Territories, Special Committee Established</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced on May 14th that American troops had landed on Attu Island in the Aleutian Islands, and that Japanese troops were currently engaged in fierce fighting with them. Attu Island was renamed Hotta Island after being occupied by Japanese troops on June 8th of last year. The reason why the General Headquarters did not use the name Hotta Island in this announcement is that the name Hotta Island was originally given by the local Japanese military unit and has not yet been officially decided. Therefore, the old name Attu Island is still used in official documents. Other names, such as Narukami Island and Daikarasu, were also given by local Japanese military units and have not yet been officially decided. Regarding the renaming of occupied territories, a Committee for the Names of Occupied Territories has been established within the Cabinet to handle the matter. Currently, Malaya, Syonan, Java, Jakarta, etc., have all been officially renamed after being decided by this committee.</p>
<h3>Borneo Authorities Organize Inland Survey Team</h3>
<p>Makassar, 16th (Central News Agency) – In order to inspect the situation in the interior of Borneo and investigate its resources, the Japanese military government authorities here have organized a "Borneo Inland Survey Team" consisting of members of the resource investigation team, civil administration officials, and local police. The team departed from here yesterday, and it is expected that this trip will make a great contribution to the development plan of Borneo.</p>

<h3>Universities in Beijing</h3>
<p>— Student</p>
<p>This year, Beijing's spring is particularly short. Three weeks ago, a cold snap took away many lives, and now, men in light-colored suits are already appearing on Wangfujing Street. However, this year's spring is very bright. The lilacs in the Li Park are blooming exceptionally beautifully, and Chairman Zhu even invited friends to his private residence to hold a "Spirit Appreciation Banquet." The crabapple blossoms at the home of an old friend are said to be more fragrant and abundant than ever before, causing him to say with a smile, "This year should bring good luck!"</p>
<p>Here, let's see how the educational sector, where Beijing's floral spirit resides, is faring.</p>
<p>Before the incident, Beijing was the headquarters of China's education sector. Just in terms of universities, besides the so-called "Big Five Universities"—Peking University, Yenching University, Tsinghua University, Normal University, and Fu Jen Catholic University—there were also Peking Normal University and various colleges, Peking Union Medical College, Sino-French University, the Art College, Chinese University, Chaoyang University, Northeastern University, etc., with tens of thousands of university students. Of course, at that time, these university students occasionally caused a stir, making the elders dizzy, but they never broke the string of songs. Now, only Yenching, Peking Union Medical College, Fu Jen, and Sino-French remain, and in the private university sector, Chinese University still exists as before. Later, Normal University and Peking University were restored, and a New People's College was added, but like trying to prop up the east while the west falls, Sino-French University was the first to close after the defeat of France, followed by Yenching and Peking Union Medical College.</p>
<p>The restoration of Normal University and Peking University took place under extremely difficult circumstances. Although a very modern new Peking University campus was built behind the red building in Sandakan, the splendor of the architecture could not enrich the content. The library's collection is not as rich as before. When Yenching University was closed, there was a brief period of excitement at the various schools. With the efforts of the government, most of the Yenching students were assigned to the various colleges of Peking University to continue their studies, and some of the Yenching faculty naturally transferred to Peking University and Normal University. However, the Yenching personnel were limited, and after the distribution to Fu Jen and Chinese University, the number was extremely small, and most of the famous professors had retired, so it did not actually increase the strength much.</p>
<p>However, Fu Jen and Chinese University became lively. Fu Jen, which was in the rearguard of the Big Five and was in danger of not being selected, suddenly stood at the forefront of the education sector after Yenching University was closed, at least in the opinion of the general public. However, it is now also inferior due to the social and economic environment. Chinese University is also lucky. No matter what it did before the incident, it could not revitalize the school, but now it is a first-class private university. Some of the better Yenching professors were actually invited here by President He, and the number of students increased accordingly. However, because the foundation is not solid and there are economic difficulties, whether it will still be able to retain professors and students next year has become a question.</p>
<p>The reasons for this recession are not only the lack of faculty and subjects, but also the decrease in the number of students. Where did these students go? Due to economic pressure, many have had to change careers, but most are staying at home and not attending classes. Not attending classes is originally something that some young people like, especially now that there is an economic reason!</p>
<p>The burden of life is too heavy. The price of rice has risen from about one mao per catty to more than three yuan. The cost for each student is at least two thousand gold per year, and even if they find a noble profession after graduation, they probably won't get half of that as a reward. This is the time to calculate. A maid costs one hundred one-yuan bills per month. Even if you use economical methods, you can go to the street stalls next to the road after class and buy one or two sesame cakes or corn buns to cope with the rumbling hunger. Sometimes you can also encounter teachers who no longer consider themselves superior, stare at each other, and smile at each other. However, it is never as good as sitting idly in the garden, where you can also sweep away the dust and sand brought to the courtyard from the Gobi Desert by the northwest wind, make tea, and cook food. This can save two to three thousand gold per year in tuition fees and one hundred one-yuan bills per month in maid fees. It is under the calculation of this era that Fu Jen wanted to implement the new economic policy last year, thinking of relying on recruiting more new students to maintain school expenses. It actually admitted nearly one thousand out of about one thousand two hundred applicants, and for a time it proudly proclaimed its success. However, it soon published advertisements in the newspaper to continue recruiting new students, because only two to three hundred of the one thousand or so admitted students reported, and conversely, about five hundred students dropped out this semester.</p>
<p>The professors are running around all day to earn a living. In addition to teaching part-time everywhere to hunt for jobs, they have eaten enough chalk dust, carry their bags, and argue with rickshaw pullers who are closely following and demanding rides, their faces red with anger. After walking angrily to their front doors, they still have to do the labor themselves. The students, after taking their book boxes back home, have to run errands, wash clothes, and dump out the dirt. They no longer have time to write love letters. The so-called "labor is sacred," which has only been seen on paper for more than ten years, has silently climbed into real life under the huge arm of this environment. Therefore, the authorities came out to advocate "production education." In addition to promoting it in newspapers, they also ordered all schools to hold teacher-student farming campaigns during the spring break. However, this did not arouse the interest of teachers and students who were fighting poverty. As a result, those who could escape work escaped, and those who had to do it did it perfunctorily. On that newly cultivated farm, which had been transformed from a tennis court, no oily green shoots grew.</p>
<p>"Production education" is indeed a method to remedy current ills, and the work-study system does have the possibility of pulling lost students back to the lecture hall. However, how to realize it is a problem worth studying. (May 10)</p>

<h3>Italy Takes Full Defense Measures on Mediterranean Islands, Confident of Crushing Enemy Attack Attempts, Heavy Casualties If Britain and the United States Attempt Landing in Europe</h3>
<p>Rome, 16th (Central News Agency) – Italian Lieutenant General Lucis Quino praised the bravery of the Italian forces in Tunisia and the fervent spirit of the Italian people at the Finance Committee held in the Upper House on the 15th. Regarding the future war situation, he said that the Mediterranean islands have been placed under the command of the Italian General Staff and that full defense measures have been taken. In the future, with the great strategy of the Italian Army's leadership and the bravery of the Italian soldiers, the enemy's attack attempts will surely be crushed. Admiral Regal Diti then declared that the Italian Navy has prepared to deal with any situation, saying that the Italian Navy's maritime supply operations in the North African campaign have been in constant fierce battles with the enemy's large fleet and air force. In the past six months, the enemy has concentrated all their ships in narrow waters, making the operations extremely difficult. When Italy first joined the war, naval authorities predicted that the Italian Navy's ability to resist in various waters would be difficult to sustain for several months. However, more than three years have passed, and we still pose a significant threat to the enemy. Finally, General Puji Erda announced that since the Italian Air Force joined the war, it has sunk 145 enemy merchant ships, totaling 1,060,000 tons, and 67 enemy warships, including 20 cruisers, 21 destroyers, and 7 submarines. It has also shot down 2,342 enemy aircraft, of which 1,944 were shot down in aerial combat. In addition, it has severely damaged approximately 1,000 enemy aircraft. At the same time, the Italian Air Force has transported 610,000 troops and 42,000 tons of military supplies to the front lines.</p>
<p>Rome, 16th (Central News Agency) – The Italian military headquarters announced a battle report on the 15th: (1) German bomber squadrons bombed Porto Velo on the night of the 14th, sinking an oil tanker and damaging a medium-sized cargo ship. (2) Enemy aircraft attacked Palermo and the Sardinian Islands on the 14th, causing slight casualties among the citizens. Italian anti-aircraft guns shot down eleven of them. (3) Italian aircraft engaged in aerial combat with enemy aircraft on the east coast of Sardinia, shooting down two enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>Rome, 16th (Central News Agency) – The Italian Post Office said today that the Mediterranean coast from Western France to the Turkish-Greek border and the largest islands in the Mediterranean are now under Axis control. During World War I, the Mediterranean belonged to the British sphere of influence, and the coastal areas were ruled by countries allied with Britain. Only British fleets could freely enter and exit the ports and bases. At that time, only ten to sixteen German submarines were active in the Mediterranean, but they were still able to inflict a huge loss of 2.5 million tons on the British, forcing Britain to reroute most of its shipping around the Cape of Good Hope. Under the current circumstances, Britain must be careful to prevent the power of Italian ships, submarines, German light cruisers, and the large air force in the Mediterranean. It is definitely not as easy as it was during World War I. Regarding the British and American plans to land in the Mediterranean, the report stated that Churchill admitted two years ago that the British suffered heavy losses in the Battle of Crete due to inadequate supplies and difficulty in landing. The landing forces must maintain close contact with ships at sea, and the Dardanelles adventure can be considered a warning.</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) – After the end of the North African campaign, the development of the war situation in the Mediterranean is of great concern to the general public. The forced withdrawal of the Axis forces from North Africa is only the prelude to the British and American forces attacking the European continent, so it is difficult to influence the overall situation of the war. It is not difficult to imagine that the British and American forces intend to attack the southern part of Europe from their bases in North Africa. It is generally believed that this matter was discussed in Canada long ago by the British and Americans, but whether the British and Americans can implement this plan is still in doubt. Speaking of the southern side of Europe, from the Balkans in the east to Iberia in the west, the coastline is extremely long. Since the Battle of Dunkirk, Germany has not continued to attack the British mainland, so British defenses will gradually become consolidated. Taking Iberia as an example, now that the war in Tunisia has ended, if Britain and the United States do not immediately carry out landing operations in Europe, their difficulties will inevitably increase. It is generally believed that the current large-scale bombing of Pantelleria, Sicily, Sardinia, and other islands by the British and Americans is also a preparation for new operations. However, this time is very different from the North African landing operation last autumn, that is, landing on the territory of a belligerent country. From a common sense perspective, carrying out such an operation requires enduring great sacrifices. It is not yet possible to judge whether the United States and Britain will make a desperate bet to completely dominate the Strait of Sicily, or whether they will carry out landing operations in other locations. Ever since the Cairo combat talks were held, the world has been closely watching the situation in the Balkans, but judging from the situation of the British and American forces in the Near East and Turkey's attitude, it will inevitably become a problem in the near future. On the one hand, the British and Americans seem to be carrying out various activities in the Iberian Peninsula, but the Axis forces' fierce fighting in Tunisia for six months proves the solidity of the defenses on the southern side of the European continent and allows them to deploy large forces. Furthermore, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, Crete, Rhodes, and other islands are all safe and sound. The Axis forces will definitely use this to defend to the death and prevent the British and American forces from approaching the mainland.</p>
<h3>Discord in the Washington Conference: Difficult to Have New Actions on the Pacific</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The most significant issue currently emerging at the Washington Conference is the revision of the Casablanca Conference resolutions and whether Japan should be considered the greatest enemy of the Axis powers. The participation of Field Marshal Wavell, Admiral Somerville, Field Marshal Brooke, Lieutenant General Stilwell, and Foreign Minister Evatt indicates that the discussions concern not only the European theater but also the war in the East. This view is based on the following facts: first, since the beginning of this year, General MacArthur's headquarters and the government in China have repeatedly requested more manpower and resources, pointing out that Japan is preparing to take further action in the southwestern Pacific. Second, converted isolationists have begun to loudly demand that the United States focus on actions in the Pacific, as they understand that the United States has little say in the post-war issues of Europe, as can be seen from the recent Polish-Soviet dispute. Third, since it was revealed that Japan has sufficient ships to engage in new ambitions in the Pacific, the United States is even more worried that Japan will become invincible after stabilizing Greater East Asia. All these facts can illustrate the recent trend of American public opinion. The following points can show the British perspective: first, in December of last year, "The Economist" did not attach importance to Japan's activities in the South Seas, believing that although Japan's strength would greatly increase after organizing the region, it lacked sufficient merchant ships. Second, the "Daily Telegraph" of London commented on the Washington Conference on Thursday, strongly advocating for new actions in the Pacific but also emphasizing that "British and American leaders are still united in thinking that their primary task is to defeat Hitler and destroy the German army." Observers believe that Britain hopes to resolve the European war as soon as possible, which will affect Australia, India, and other eastern regions. This is the biggest difference in opinion between Britain and the United States. Therefore, it is expected that the main discussions in Washington will focus on determining a new world strategy for Britain and the United States to deal with the new situation and resolving fundamental conflicts in opinions. However, observers believe that this conflict cannot be fully resolved. Without the cooperation of the Soviet Union, Britain and the United States cannot take any new action in the Pacific. Observers pointed out that the Soviet Union has not indicated any desire to break the non-aggression pact with Japan. Therefore, the anti-Axis strategy seems to be to allocate part of its military force to the West and part to the East.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - As the North African war situation is urgent and the Allied forces are rumored to be launching a landing operation in Europe, the White House suddenly announced on the 11th that British Prime Minister Churchill, accompanied by the heads of the British Army, Navy, and Air Force, was visiting the United States and was currently in talks with President Roosevelt. The announcement did not mention the time of Churchill's arrival in Washington or the content of the talks. However, according to observers with access to British sources, the focus of this meeting seems to be: first, an agreement on the time and place of the Second Front in Europe; second, a revision of the strategies discussed at the Casablanca Conference; and third, mediation of the Polish-Soviet disputes. Tracing back to the Allied camp, since the start of the Tunisian campaign, there has been grand publicity about launching a landing operation in Europe. Furthermore, there were calls from a corner of the Soviet Union, and the voice of the Second Front was temporarily very loud. However, before the postwar management of Europe (i.e., the spheres of influence of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union) had been delineated, Britain and the United States were unwilling to sacrifice their own countries to seek benefits for the Soviet Union and risk attacking Europe. Therefore, it was natural that the Second Front could not be established at that time. Secondly, even if they were to revise the measures discussed at the Casablanca Conference, Chongqing, Australia, New Zealand, and others have always expressed opposition to the Europe-centric policies of Britain and the United States. There are significant differences of opinion between the Allied Joint Operations Headquarters in Washington and the Allied Southwest Pacific Command in Australia. Therefore, today, it is indeed necessary to revise the Europe-centric policies of the Casablanca Conference. However, the prerequisite question is the landing operation in Europe. However, the spheres of influence determined by the Allied camp in Europe are sufficient to influence the unfolding of the landing operation in Europe. The first agreement on the method of mediating the Polish-Soviet disputes will be the only question of the Roosevelt-Churchill talks. Since the end of the Tunisian war, the Polish-Soviet disputes have become not only a problem for the two countries but also the most important political problem for the Allied camp. If the Polish-Soviet disputes are not resolved first, and the spheres of influence in Europe are not determined, then the European landing operation will ultimately be difficult to implement. British Foreign Secretary Eden went to Washington to mediate the Polish-Soviet disputes and stayed for a long time, working hard, but ultimately without success. It is unpredictable whether Churchill's hard work and talks with Roosevelt will be successful.</p>
<p>Kuybyshev, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Soviet newspapers have not yet commented on the meeting between British Prime Minister Churchill and US President Roosevelt currently being held in Washington. Soviet newspapers have only published announcements from the British Information Agency and the White House regarding Churchill's visit to Washington.</p>
<h3>German Assault Teams in Kuban Region Launch Surprise Attack on Major Soviet Positions; Heavy Casualties Among Soviet Troops; Germans Also Launch Offensive in Leningrad Region</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Swedish Capital, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to frontline reports, German assault teams in the Kuban bridgehead region launched a surprise attack on heavily fortified Soviet positions. After fierce fighting, they captured important Soviet positions. In this operation, 1,500 Soviet soldiers were killed, and approximately the same number were captured. The Soviet army also lost many weapons and other materials. On the other hand, German anti-aircraft gun units sank twenty-eight Soviet boats full of soldiers attempting to land at the mouth of the river in the Dimlyuki area. It is reported that German forces on the Leningrad front also launched an offensive after heavy shelling. The Soviet military newspaper "Red Star" has admitted that the German army has begun an offensive in a certain area and expressed concern about the German offensive. According to reports from the German News Agency, German assault teams also broke into Soviet positions in the central Donets region and south of Lake Ladoga, capturing many Soviet fortresses and infantry positions.</p>
<p>Helsinki, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Stefani Agency quoted yesterday's communique from the Finnish High Command as saying that in the past twenty-four hours, there had been local reconnaissance activities and artillery exchanges in the Karelian Isthmus. On the western section of the same battle line, a Soviet unit launched an attack but was repelled and suffered heavy losses. There were no other important news on other fronts.</p>
<p>Bern, 15th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A Berlin dispatch states that German forces attacked Soviet positions in the Kuban bridgehead and annihilated several enemy units. Other areas remained quiet. German forces shelled railways and factories south of Lake Ladoga and in Leningrad. Taking advantage of the lull in the fighting, the German and Romanian armies were rushing to make various preparations to prevent a large-scale Soviet offensive, as the Soviet army has been frequently moving troops and transporting large quantities of heavy weapons from the rear. The German side used bombers to heavily attack Soviet transport units, artillery positions, airfields, and railways. The Soviet mouthpiece "Svesda" reported that the German spring offensive was expected, but it was difficult to predict where it would be launched first. The German army has concentrated a large number of troops in several areas and is making preparations in the Orel and Kursk areas south of Moscow, indicating that the German army may attack Moscow. The newspaper also urged the Soviet army to be prepared without complacency.</p>
<h3>Strong Anti-British Sentiment Among Natives in Syria, Iran, and Other Places</h3>
<p>Ankara, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to indirect reports from here, Palestine and Syria remain turbulent, with nationalists in the region resisting British aggressors. The office of the Palestinian Communist Party in Natanya, near Haifa, was vandalized by unidentified individuals, who destroyed all documents, furniture, and photos of Lenin and Stalin. These offices are the headquarters of the Communist Party and the center of communist propaganda for the British army stationed near Natanya. According to a Stefani Agency report citing Damascus, Syrian nationalists blew up the railway bridge over the Litani River near Sidon, causing train traffic on the line to be suspended for several days. British military authorities have arrested 150 farmers in the area in an attempt to find the perpetrators. Another Stefani Agency report states that in Tya-el-Syio-Gaur, Syria, tax collectors ordered to collect wheat were attacked by farmers with rifles. The tax collectors requested assistance from the British army, who opened fire on the villagers, killing several people and wounding many more. In addition, the British army set fire to several villages in retaliation.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Disturbances occur frequently throughout Iran. Although they have been repeatedly suppressed by the Allied forces, they have not been reduced at all. According to reports from Tehran, a large-scale disturbance occurred in the Kerman region. A large number of Iranians, divided into three teams, attacked British troops, destroying all facilities, looting food and weapons, and killing several British soldiers. The Iranian gendarmerie and a large unit of the Indian army rushed to the scene and clashed with the Iranians. It is reported that many Iranian gendarmes were killed or injured.</p>
<h3>Argentina Supplies Wheat to Spain</h3>
<p>Madrid, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - It was revealed here yesterday that Argentina is still shipping wheat to Spain at regular intervals in accordance with the agreement signed with Spain at the end of last year. All wheat transported from Argentina to Spain is loaded by Spanish ships. The Spanish cargo ship "Monte Os" is expected to soon sail from Buenos Aires, carrying 3,600 tons of wheat and 5,000 tons of barley to Spain.</p>
<h3>British Radio Broadcast Denies German Landings</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - It has recently been rumored that German forces have landed at several locations on the British coast. Therefore, the British Broadcasting Corporation broadcast yesterday to officially deny this. It is said that Prime Minister Churchill mentioned the possibility of a German invasion of Britain in a broadcast in Washington, causing the rumor to resurface.</p>
<h3>US Republican Party Plans to Nominate MacArthur for President</h3>
<p>Akira, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Stefani Agency relayed a Washington report stating that Senator Vandenberg of Michigan and other important Republicans have begun campaigning to nominate General MacArthur as the Republican candidate to compete against President Roosevelt in the next presidential election. It is generally believed that General MacArthur is most supported by the public, and that all presidents elected in the past, except for those in the previous world war, have been military figures, such as Washington, Jackson, Tyler, and Grant. Therefore, General MacArthur's election as president is a matter of course.</p>
<h3>Presidents of Bolivia and US Issue Joint Declaration</h3>
<p>Akira, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - After Bolivian President Castillo arrived in Washington, he and the US president issued a joint statement stating that they had discussed issues of mutual interest. Bolivia is currently supplying the United States with tin, rubber, and quinine, and the two countries have signed an agreement to strengthen cooperation.</p>
<h3>A Great Tragedy in World History (5)</h3>
<p>- Tokutomi Iichiro</p>
<p>(5) A Country Destroyed by Empty Talk</p>
<p>One of the most notable trends in British party politics is that they argue not for the sake of political views, but for the sake of arguing. In a word, it is a country destroyed by empty talk. The British were originally a nation of common sense and a nation of action; however, since the establishment of party politics, the British have become a nation of words. The nation of words gradually becomes the nation of empty talk, which is a natural trend.</p>
<p>Morley once said:</p>
<p>"The greatest hardship for us party members is that no matter how similar the opinions of the parties are in reality, they always insist on saying that they are completely different and irreconcilable, so that the general public can agree."</p>
<p>Morley has always had the reputation of "Honest John" (John is Morley's name), and is one of the most outstanding personalities in the party. He is also known for being Gladstone's right-hand man on the issue of Irish autonomy. If he said this, I'm afraid no one would disbelieve him, right?</p>
<p>Regardless of compromise, it was originally the nature of the British. For the sake of party politics, not only is there no question of compromise, but they also have to go to extremes and treat each other as if they are irreconcilable, confronting each other in words in order to gain power or maintain the power they have already obtained.</p>
<p>In this way, since the implementation of parliamentary politics, Britain has had no economists or politicians. The British parliament has almost become a nest for mere debaters, skilled debaters, sophists, and verbose speakers to display their useless debates. Therefore, the leaders of the parties, not to mention those with ambition, if they want to establish themselves and advance, they can only immerse themselves in parliamentary debates in order to hunt for high or the highest positions in the political world.</p>
<p>This is just like how all politicians in China are generally skilled in writing, British politicians, even with the difference between eloquence and ineloquence, can never be without garrulity; otherwise, they cannot become politicians. Therefore, even in times of national crisis, what they are wholeheartedly focused on is not so much presenting their opinions to the people as it is on how to present model eloquent speeches.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the First World War, how wonderful, concise, clear, sincere, and moving were the speeches of the then Foreign Secretary Grey and others, they are still praised by people today. Even in this Second World War, the parliamentary speeches or broadcasts of people like Churchill are evaluated in Britain as so-and-so good or so-and-so bad, just like how in our country's theaters, people evaluate the performances of actors Kikugoro and Kichiemon.</p>
<p>Therefore, British politicians are not so much national economists as they are artists of the mouth. Then it is by no means inconceivable how many British politicians come from the legal profession.</p>
<p>After Pitt the Younger, the longest-serving prime minister, Asquith (H.H. Asquith) was also a lawyer. Lloyd George, who initially served as Asquith's colleague, then his subordinate, and finally replaced Asquith, was originally a low-ranking rural lawyer. Someone like Simon, who has gone from the Liberal Party through various changes to become the Lord Chancellor, is also a lawyer.</p>
<p>In the Conservative Party, Birkenhead (F.E.S. Birkenhead) was a famous barrister of the common people. Carson, the last brave general of the Conservative Party opposing the Irish Home Rule Act, was also one of the most powerful advocates in the courtroom. Although lawyers are necessary in the courtroom, for the cause of national economy, one must rely on economists.</p>
<p>As for the economists, they cannot be filled by eloquence. People like Okubo Toshimichi and Saigo Takamori of Japan, except when it is necessary to state their opinions, do not easily open their mouths. There are occasional exceptions in Britain as well - for example, General Kitchener (H.H. Kitchener). When parliamentary politics reaches its peak, it is precisely when British politics degenerates to its lowest ebb.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the Irish Home Rule Bill, which is the worst example of parliamentary politics. Ireland has always been Britain's cancer, and it is still a cancer now, and it will probably still be a cancer in the future. Gladstone was the one who determined that Ireland was a cancer and wanted to apply surgical treatment. Many people in the world believe that the reason why Gladstone shook hands with the Irish Home Rule Party was because he wanted to obtain or maintain his power with the assistance of the Home Rule Party. Whether or not the fact is really like this, that I do not know.</p>
<p>In short, this was indeed a wise measure. If Irish autonomy had been allowed at that time, then Ireland would now have become the country of Ireland, and would have nothing to do with Britain at all, and would not have taken the attitude of sticking a dagger in the throat of Britain. However, the Chamberlain faction, which split from the Conservative Party that opposed the Home Rule Bill and the Liberal Party, united with the Conservative Party under the name of the Unionist Party to monopolize power. It was not until 1906 that the Liberal Party finally saw the dawn. However, although the Home Rule Party had temporarily gained power in the meantime, from Gladstone's last cabinet (August 1892 to March 1894) to Rosebery's (A.P.P. Rosebery) most recent cabinet (March 1894 to June 1895), power was soon returned to the original Conservative Party.</p>
<p>When the Liberal Party gained power and re-passed the Irish Home Rule Bill, they encountered the opposition of the House of Lords, and ultimately it was not implemented. Just when they were about to reach their goal after all their hard work and were about to implement it, Edward VII died and George V took office. At the beginning of his new government, a compromise conference between the two parties was opened in the palace by order of the king, but even with the king's mediation, they could not reach an agreement. Just when they were about to implement it, the Conservative Party, which was the opposition party, disregarded the resolution of parliament and resolutely imported weapons into Ireland and recruited soldiers, with the most hardcore Carson-Smith of the non-Home Rule Party as the commander-in-chief, and was about to launch a civil war when the First World War broke out. Therefore, the problem was suspended. After five years of delay, just as it was about to be brought up again, Ireland no longer agreed to the original Home Rule Bill and faced Britain with almost the attitude of an independent country.</p>
<p>Because of this situation, people's hearts were agitated, assassinations were rampant, and Anning's order could not be maintained. Britain had no choice but to make the final concession, and the Republic of Ireland was established. As a result, Ireland was completely separated from the country, drove away the governor-general installed by Britain, and now changed its national title to Eire. Regardless of Britain's declaration of war on Germany, Ireland resolutely maintained neutrality, almost in a completely independent posture. Although the other colonies promised to be part of the British Commonwealth by following their loyalty to the British king, Ireland even refused the official words of loyalty.</p>
<p>From the Home Rule Bill to independence, the historical relationship between Britain and Ireland for fifty years cannot be said to be a major crime of establishing evidence that party politics has misled the important national affairs of the country. When Cromwell issued the order to dissolve the Long Parliament, he declared as follows:</p>
<p>On April 20, 1653, Commander-in-Chief Cromwell walked to the Parliament, sat on a chair, and listened attentively. But finally he could not bear it anymore, stood up and said, "Get out of here!" "It's enough, I hope you stop chattering! ... You still call yourselves a parliament, even if it is a parliament, what are you doing.... Among you, there are either drunkards or butt-fuckers, ... How can you guys maintain God's favor and be a parliament. Ugh! Go! I order..." He raised the giant mallet, which was the sacred symbol of parliamentary power, and said, "How can this piece of trash be cleaned up? Or should I just throw it away?"</p>
<p>Like this, the British parliament is simply a place of cicada chirps and frog croaks, and their long garrulity will eventually send Britain to decline, like the cicadas chirping away the evening. (Ding: Translated from the Eastern Daily News of May 2)</p>

<h3>The Commerce Control Council Will Handle All Material Management; The Authorities Are Actively Undertaking This Matter; Material Movement Certificates Have Begun to be Issued</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources from authoritative circles yesterday, the management of all important or non-important materials will be authorized by the authorities to be handled by the National Commerce Control Council. For example, allocation, control, procurement, permission or non-permission, etc. For this reason, the material control agencies will have a comprehensive innovation. Merchants can obtain unified guidance, and the commercial market can gradually move towards the right track. The authorities are still actively working on this matter.</p>
<p>Spot Check of Yarn Cloth</p>
<p>The supplementary registration of cotton yarn cloth inventory has expired on the day before yesterday (Saturday), according to the National Commerce Control Council. All merchants or individuals who have not fulfilled the registration procedures will not be allowed to enjoy the right to move or sell. In order to crack down on hoarding, the council will send personnel for spot checks. If any unregistered cotton yarn cloth is found, it will be dealt with according to law.</p>
<p>Material Movement</p>
<p>The council has now begun to handle the issuance of permits for the movement of 25 important materials. All merchants can directly apply to the Material Permit Office of the council in the Hamilton Building on Jiangxi Road for a movement permit. However, these goods are only allowed to be transported to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the North China and South China areas (including Guangdong, Shantou, Xiamen, etc.).</p>
<h3>Economic Special High Police: Deadline for Trainees of the Fifth Training Class to Report</h3>
<p>The fourth economic police and special high police training classes of the Central Police Academy will expire on the fourth of next month. The fifth training class should continue to be organized. However, it has been found that the trainees of each previous training class often reported after the deadline, and even after the start of the class, there were still continuous reports, which is very detrimental to the course. Therefore, the Ministry of Interior ordered the police agencies of all provinces and cities one month in advance that all trainees must report according to the deadline of the Ministry of Interior and must not delay in order to show uniformity and avoid delaying their studies.</p>
<h3>Expelling Beggars in the South City</h3>
<p>Recently, prices have skyrocketed, and the livelihood of the common people has become more serious. Street beggars wander around all day long, unable to eat when hungry and unable to drink when thirsty, and their situation is especially pitiful. However, these people often seize food from women and children to satisfy their hunger. It has been found that this act not only harms the appearance of the city but also disturbs local security. This trend must not be allowed to continue. The South City District Baojia Self-Defense Corps, in order to help maintain the safety of pedestrians, under the close connection between the police and Baojia, will expel all beggars in the entire South City from the country and are not allowed to stay. The members of each group have been implementing it universally since yesterday, and in the future, beggars in the entire South City will disappear from the streets.</p>
<h3>Responsibility for Riding the Tram Without a Ticket</h3>
<p>Although the tram company authorities have repeatedly cracked down on the bad habit of ticket sellers skimming profits, it has not been effective so far, resulting in a great impact on the company's revenue. Yesterday, a senior official of the tram company said: Regarding the matter of ticket selling skimming profits, the authorities have repeatedly tried to make up for the shortcomings. In addition to adding plainclothes ticket inspectors, the only way is to hope that passengers can closely contact the authorities. Passengers must obtain tickets from the ticket seller that match the price paid, otherwise they can secretly record the number of the ticket seller and notify the company. The company will have severe penalties. The official also said: If the ticket seller holds back the passenger's ticket money and the passenger does not negotiate, then once the ticket inspector discovers it, the responsibility for not having a ticket must be borne by the passenger himself. Therefore, for the sake of his own interests, the passenger should also pay close attention to the ticket seller's skimming profits. It has been found that the company should effectively crack down on ticket selling skimming profits. If the passenger refuses to pay the fare, then the responsibility for not having a ticket should be borne by the passenger. If the fare has been paid, or the ticket seller deliberately delays collecting it, or has collected it but delays paying the ticket, then where does the responsibility lie? It seems that this should be distinguished. On the other hand, the livelihood problem of ticket sellers can also be studied.</p>
<h3>Second Phase Household Oil Sales End Today</h3>
<p>The second phase of household oil sales citywide, which began on the 7th of this month, has now lasted for ten days. Each resident can purchase four ounces of oil at a price of five yuan and ten cents. It is understood that this phase of cooking oil sales will end today. All retailers will complete their closing procedures today and report the sales situation to the wholesale distributors. At the same time, according to a Datong News Agency reporter, preparations for the third phase of household oil sales are already underway.</p>
<h3>1.8 Sheng of Grain Per Person in West Shanghai</h3>
<p>The West Shanghai District's first and second districts' household rice, consisting of 4,500 bags, has been collected by the first trade allocation meeting of the district's public grain united office. Sales are scheduled to begin simultaneously from 55 public grain distribution points in the district today (the 17th). It is learned that the total amount of grain allocated to the district this time is estimated at 5,300 shi (石) of pure rice. For this phase of grain allocation, the authorities are allocating an average of 1.8 sheng (升) of whole rice per person, priced at five yuan and forty cents, based on the district's population of 282,757 in February of this year. According to the person in charge of the public grain distribution points, some citizens in the district do not collect their rice at the designated public grain distribution points on time, which greatly delays subsequent work. It is hoped that citizens will adhere to the schedule to facilitate public grain distribution and benefit grain administration.</p>
<h3>Millet's Crimes to be Finalized Soon; Consul Court to Announce Verdict, Case Unlikely to Move to Saigon</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency report from Shanghai states that the case of Zhang Jinhai, a young man who tragically died from injuries sustained under torture during interrogation, has reached a conclusion after authorities argued on the basis of reason. However, after the main culprit, Millet, was formally prosecuted by the French Consul Court, a hearing was held, but a formal verdict has not yet been issued. Now, according to a Central News Agency reporter, after further questioning by the French Consul Court, the entire case will be finalized, and Millet will be severely punished. Whether the court has the authority to pronounce Millet's crimes will be instructed by the Saigon authorities, so the announcement of Millet's crimes may not be transferred to Saigon.</p>
<h3>Poor People's Mat Sheds on North Zhejiang Road Urgently Need Donations for Repairs; Over a Thousand Refugees Living in a Swamp; Repair Costs Exceed 100,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organization United Disaster Relief Association yesterday appealed to all sectors for funds to repair shelters. According to the association, the Cilian Nursing Home and Ciji Children's Education Center currently accommodate over a thousand elderly, weak, orphaned, and poor people in approximately one hundred straw sheds built about six years ago at the former Ciyuan Shelter at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Qipu Road. Most of the sheds are damaged, and leaks occur whenever it rains. Hiring craftsmen for repairs is expensive, and the estimated cost is no less than 100,000 yuan. As the rainy season approaches, the matter cannot be delayed any longer. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will extend their compassionate wishes and generously donate to provide shelter for these thousand-plus poor people, whose merits would be boundless.</p>
<h3>Kangxi Dynasty Court Music; Famous Musical Performance</h3>
<p>Mrs. Della Chiesa, wife of the Italian Ambassador to China, will host a concert at the Italian Auditorium, 2001 Jing'an Temple Road, Shanghai, on May 29th. The concert will feature performances by renowned pianist Neri, violinist Bellini, and cellist Bellezza. The program is exceptionally brilliant, including a sonata composed by the Italian musician Father Teodorico Pedrini, who was favored by Emperor Kangxi of the early Qing Dynasty. This work will be performed publicly for the first time in the world using modern instruments – piano and violin. It is said that the original score consisted of twelve pieces, which were lost for two centuries but were recently discovered in the archives in Beiping. Mr. Bellezza has selected one piece and carefully arranged it for the aforementioned instruments. In addition to the performance of Beethoven's beautiful trio, the program will also include Corelli's Adagio, Bach's Italian Concerto, Sammartini's Sonata, and famous pieces by Veracini, Boccherini, MacGrini, and others, interspersed throughout the program. It is anticipated that the concert will be deeply moving and inspire listeners. It is reported that tickets can be purchased from Fowler &amp; Co. at 430 Sichuan Road, the Asia Credit Bureau at 303 Avenue Edward VII, Savoy Restaurant at 316 Avenue Albert, or the Italian Club at 10 Route Ghisi.</p>
<h3>Central China Cotton Control Association Halts Private Cotton Smuggling; Large Quantities of Cotton in Jiangsu and Zhejiang; Association Sends Personnel to Purchase</h3>
<p>The Central China Cotton Control Association, in view of the shortage of raw cotton materials and the high demand for cotton, has noticed that some individuals are secretly smuggling cotton for profit. The association is now taking measures to prevent this. Furthermore, the association is also aware that a large amount of cotton from Jiangbei (north of the Yangtze River) is being transported to Jiangnan (south of the Yangtze River) and is seeking to stop this as well. At the same time, in order to increase cotton production, the association has dispatched technical personnel to various cotton-producing areas to guide fertilization and other work after planting. According to the association's estimates, before the new cotton crop enters the market, there may be a large amount of stored cotton in various cotton-producing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang that can be purchased. Therefore, in order to solve the problem of raw cotton materials in the city, the association has sent personnel to the areas with stored cotton to carry out purchasing work.</p>
<p>National Forum</p>
<h3>A Commoner's Plea</h3>
<p>(1) Abolish Miscellaneous Taxes - Wang Zhengxiang</p>
<p>Social prices are rising daily, and taxes are increasing monthly. These taxes contribute little to government revenue but heavily burden the people. Because these miscellaneous taxes are often contracted out, taking the banquet tax in the urban area as an example (now collected by the municipal government), the contractor remits only 30,000 yuan per month, while the actual collection exceeds 500,000 yuan. Even the most basic plain noodles are not spared, enriching a small number of contractors and harming the majority of common people. It is hoped that the authorities will find a way to correct this.</p>
<p>(2) Strictly Prohibit Demolition of Houses - Jun Ba</p>
<p>Most of the houses in the South City were burned down in the war, leaving rubble-strewn streets. This has made it difficult for the residents who used to live in the South City to move back due to the shortage of houses. Demand far exceeds supply, allowing landlords to hoard properties and demand exorbitant key money. Furthermore, businesses lack the funds to rebuild due to the high cost of materials. It is outrageous that some unscrupulous individuals, due to the shortage of timber, are buying houses, demolishing them, and selling the materials for huge profits, disregarding the authorities' efforts to restore the city. Although the authorities have repeatedly issued strict prohibitions, these individuals continue to find ways to evade them, resulting in a gradual decrease in the number of houses in the South City and an increase in vacant land. I implore the authorities to immediately reiterate the strict orders, effectively implement them, assist in banning the demolition of any remaining houses for which contracts have been signed, and severely punish those who bribe officials and secretly demolish houses. Only then will there be hope for the revitalization of the South City.</p>
<p>(3) Eradicate Opium and Gambling - Yan Yi</p>
<p>After Mr. Chen Gongbo took office as the Special Mayor of Shanghai, he stated that he was determined to eradicate opium and gambling in Shanghai. However, until now, all we have seen is that gambling dens and opium dens in the South City have replaced those in West Shanghai, while smaller ones are gradually spreading in Zhabei and Hongkou. However, we believe that this is not due to the municipal authorities' lack of strict enforcement, but perhaps due to the obstruction of certain individuals with special influence, which has prevented the complete eradication.</p>
<p>Clubs and rehabilitation centers, which are harmful to the people and the nation, are springing up all over the country. We earnestly hope that enlightened rulers will clean them up and eradicate them, and never allow gambling dens and opium dens that harm the people and endanger the country to exist again, so that the peace zone can truly become a bright and happy land.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Stars Hold Friendship Tea Party; China Film Company Hosts Toho's Famous Performers</h3>
<p>The China Film Company held a tea party at the Hui Zhong Hotel on Nanjing Road at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 16th) to entertain Chinese and Japanese opera and film stars and members of the press. Among those present were famous performers from the Toho Opera Company, including Taiko Fukumoto, Tsuruko Shibata, as well as Gong Qiuxia and Hu Rongrong, along with dozens of reporters from various newspapers. They were warmly received by the company's publicity department heads, Kosaka, Aoyagi, and Liu Junsheng, as well as director Hu Xinling. It is said that Taiko Fukumoto is a leading figure in the group and has recently received high praise for singing "China Nights" at the Nanjing Grand Theater. She is very fond of Chinese songs and yesterday, under the guidance of Ms. Gong Qiuxia, practiced the two songs "Dream Lover" and "Don't Forget Tonight." It is said that these activities will continue in the future and that she wishes to teach Japanese dance to Chinese stars to facilitate artistic exchange. It is also learned that they plan to co-star in a film soon to commemorate the occasion. Yesterday was their first meeting and it was very enjoyable.</p>

<h3>Gao Hang District Organizes Anti-Thief Corps; Rotational Night Watch to Stop the Stealing of Agricultural Products</h3>
<p>Recently, as the beans and wheat in the Shanghai suburbs are nearing maturity, theft cases have been occurring frequently. Local ruffians, hooligans, and petty criminals often take advantage of the night to steal agricultural products from the fields and sell them for cash. This not only disrupts public order but also harms the livelihoods of farmers. Therefore, the Gao Hang District, in order to effectively curb theft, has made use of the existing Baojia system to organize a night watch anti-thief corps, drawing on residents to take turns on night watch, helping each other to maintain order and suppress theft.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>Meal Plan Prices: The Shanghai Kitchen Industry Trade Association, in view of the recent inconsistencies in meal plan prices in the city, has decided through public discussion to adjust prices into four categories: Category A at 10 yuan per meal per day, Category B at 9 yuan per meal per day, Category C at 8 yuan per meal per day, and Category D at 7 yuan per meal per day, all calculated per person. These prices were implemented uniformly yesterday. All members of the industry must strictly comply with them and must not compete for business or make unauthorized increases or decreases in prices in order to maintain industry regulations.</p>
<p>Child Welfare Association Fundraising: The China Child Welfare Association's fundraising campaign for the education and care of refugee children has received enthusiastic support from all sectors, with generous donations. The total amount of donations received from all sectors is nearly 200,000 yuan, including 19,000 yuan raised independently by the association's committee member, Mr. Wang Tongyuan. The association's current fundraising campaign will end on the 24th of this month, with only a few days remaining. However, the current fundraising results have only reached two-fifths of the target. The executive department is actively promoting the campaign and hopes that people from all walks of life will continue to donate generously to complete the project, thereby benefiting the refugee children significantly.</p>

<h3>The Science of Victory (5)</h3>
<p>The reason why the Japanese army and navy have achieved great victories in the Greater East Asia War is not only due to the bravery and loyalty of the soldiers who devoted themselves to serving the country, but also to the aircraft, tanks, guns, various excellent scientific weapons, as well as provisions, medicines, construction materials, etc., supplied to the battlefield. The army has awarded the Second Army Technical Merit Medal to inventors of these victorious weapons. The recipients of the medals and the main inventors are introduced below: (Tao: Translated from the April 17th Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Research on the Manufacture of Optical Lenses...Dr. Takashi Matsu, Director of the Osaka Industrial Experiment Station of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry...</h3>
<p>Mr. Matsu was born at 10 Nishiki-cho, Kurume City. After graduating from the Department of Applied Chemistry at Kyushu University, he joined the station and has remained there ever since. He has been diligently researching optical lenses for over twenty years. During this war, he provided the air force with a type of "search eye." Previously, the manufacturing technology of optical lenses was entirely monopolized by Germany. When he was studying at Kyushu University, he believed that the reason why Germany consistently troubled Britain in the Battle of Jutland during the previous World War was because it had excellent range-finding equipment. Therefore, Mr. Matsu decided to devote himself to the study of optical lenses as his lifelong career, and to ensure that his own country could manufacture such equipment. At one point, the temperature in the laboratory, with a high-temperature furnace of 1400 degrees, reached over 40 degrees Celsius, like a steaming oven. He continued his research for two weeks, focusing on testing magnifying glasses, and invented a magnifying glass called "Boron-Silicon Crown" that was no less than German quality. Most recently, he broke the method of manufacturing magnifying glasses using a one-ton furnace and used a two-ton furnace. The price is 60-80% cheaper than before, and the quality is excellent, and the manufacturing is easy and convenient.</p>
<p>Mr. Matsu said, "Almost all optical lenses are monopolized by the Schott factory in Germany, and the manufacturing method is very mysterious. Although we can buy these items, we have never known how they are made so well. Fortunately, by racking our brains and following the traces of their manufacturing, we have achieved results that are no less than the best German products. Of course, this success is not achieved by me alone, but is the result of the joint efforts of all members of the sixth division of this experiment station, so I am willing to spend the prize money as useful research funds. I think the sinking of the Ford by the German battleship Bismarck was also due to the excellence of the range-finding equipment. In order to win the Greater East Asia War, we must have even better search eyes. I am determined to continue this research."</p>
<h3>Research on Large Wooden Buildings Using Nail-Jointing...Architect Captain Takashi Takayama and other collaborators...</h3>
<p>It is unwise to hesitate and stop because there is no iron or cement. Marshal Togo often said at pre-war meetings when the army formulated the 5:5:3 naval ratio, "Training can be unlimited!" It can be said that wisdom, effort, and persistence are unlimited. For example, aircraft hangars have always been made of steel, but hangars of the same size have been made of a large amount of wood, and their use is not only without any problems, but also has achieved great results. It can be said that this is thanks to the in-depth research of Captain Takayama, an architect in the Air Force's main construction division.</p>
<p>Architect Captain Takayama completely overcame the shortage of steel and completed a large wooden hangar. The captain and his collaborators wanted to improve the steel hangars of the past into wooden ones, with the ends connected by nails. However, this connection method started with a thorough scientific analysis, but the result was always breaking. After breaking, they reconnected it. This continued research finally completed the nail-jointing method between large buildings. Now, thanks to this connection method, 40 magnificent large hangars have been built for the use of the army.</p>
<p>The amount of iron required for this construction is only less than 10% of that required for a 20-30 ton steel structure, or 1.8 tons. Building 40 units can save 8,500 tons of steel, and the cost can be reduced by 2.5 million yuan. This is a huge saving of steel. In addition, based on this concept, the largest 40-meter iron factory has been successfully converted into a 42-meter wooden structure, and the construction speed is 30% faster than that of iron, and the cost is only 65% of that of iron. This is nothing short of a miracle.</p>
<p>This great new invention of Captain Takayama and others was produced in response to the demands of the military and political authorities, and also provides great benefits to the private sector. After three years of construction, the "Volt" Architectural Society's wartime specifications have gradually adopted this new method. (The End)</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>The Importance of Universally Establishing Farm Granaries</h3>
<p>At this extraordinary time, the government regards stabilizing people's livelihoods as one of its important national policies. To stabilize people's livelihoods, the first priority is to ensure sufficient food. To ensure sufficient food, the active emphasis is on increasing production, and the passive emphasis is on famine prevention. Therefore, universally establishing granaries and adjusting surpluses and shortages is also an important part of grain administration. Before the war, the establishment of farm granaries in various places in our country had achieved considerable results, but unfortunately, in recent years, due to the unstable situation, most of them have been suspended. Recently, I heard that the Ministry of Food has a plan to widely establish farm granaries, which is naturally a good policy for revitalizing rural areas and solving the people's food problem.</p>
<p>Universally establishing farm granaries can be carried out through two channels: First, actively urge people's organizations to universally establish them. Before the establishment is complete, simple farm granaries can be set up first, using rural public houses, ancestral halls, or farmhouses as grain warehouses. The stored grain can be discussed with local financial institutions to facilitate funding, but its entry and exit must be strictly supervised by the local government to prevent private hoarding and profiteering. Efforts must be made to make farm granaries a public welfare undertaking for the people, and the government should provide appropriate rewards.</p>
<p>Second, the local government or food adjustment agency should quickly find ways to restore the old farm granaries before the war and appropriately increase them in other suitable locations to handle the purchase, processing, storage, and transportation of food in order to adjust surpluses and deficits and balance prices. It would be best if they could also investigate the storage and demand of food in various places and supply the surplus food to places with shortages. Farmers should be allowed to store and mortgage their grain to facilitate agricultural production funds. In this way, the effectiveness of farm granaries will not only be static storage, but also dynamic adjustment. It is not only for passive famine prevention, but also for active production increase. Therefore, universally establishing farm granaries is a matter of urgency today.</p>
<p>Bank of Communications</p>
<h3>Actively Handling Agricultural Loans Confirmed. Outline of Agricultural Financial Operations: Focusing on the Jing, Su, and Sujia Areas for Agricultural Loans.</h3>
<p>The Bank of Communications, as a bank dedicated to developing national industries, has always considered agricultural lending as one of its primary businesses. After receiving orders from both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industries to implement rural loans, the bank successively dispatched personnel to various counties in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, as well as the two special municipalities of Beijing and Shanghai, to conduct on-site investigations into the rural economic conditions. Based on the investigation results, following the government's national policy, and referring to precedents of agricultural banks in various countries engaging in agricultural financial operations, the bank formulated a detailed outline of specific methods for handling agricultural financial operations and various loans. To this end, an Agricultural Economics Department was established within the head office a few days ago, specifically responsible for handling agricultural financial operations. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Initial Investigation Results of Rural Areas</p>
<p>Upon receiving the order to implement rural loans, the bank dispatched personnel to various counties in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, as well as the two special municipalities of Beijing and Shanghai, to conduct on-site investigations into the rural economic conditions. The results indicated that although agricultural product prices are currently high, the prices of various agricultural supplies and daily necessities are even higher than those of agricultural products. The general situation of small tenant farmers lacking operating funds is very common. The majority are unable to purchase fertilizers and feed, which significantly affects production. At a time when the production of materials is urgently needed during the Greater East Asia War, it is imperative to change agricultural land management from extensive to intensive. Therefore, the need for financial support in rural areas is indeed urgent. Expanding rural loans is in line with the government's wartime economic policy guidelines and the aim of actively increasing production.</p>
<p>Outline of Agricultural Business Operations</p>
<p>In order to comply with the government's intentions and expedite the preparation of agricultural loans, the bank has established an Agricultural Economics Department within the bank, appointing Zhang Enjin as the head of the department, and Liang Dingshu and Fu Dichen as deputy heads, specifically responsible for handling agricultural financial operations. However, the nature of this business is special and different from ordinary banking operations. Because it promotes agricultural economic policies and aims to establish a new rural financial system and institution, it is not profit-oriented. Therefore, in addition to drafting agricultural financial business regulations and various loan rules and submitting them to the government for approval and granting of special operating rights, and conducting operations under the guidance and supervision of the government, the bank has carefully studied and determined the following business outline in accordance with the government's national policy, the actual situation in various regions, and the precedents of agricultural banks in various countries engaging in agricultural financial operations: (1) Improve rural economic conditions; (2) Increase agricultural production and assist in agricultural advancement and promotion; (3) Guide farmers to establish a financial system and financial institutions with self-ownership, self-management, and self-enjoyment; (4) Support and establish owner-cultivator farmers.</p>
<p>Steps for Implementing Agricultural Loan Focus</p>
<p>The bank will conduct a second detailed investigation of the rural economy in the near future. Once the investigation is completed, it will, based on the actual situation, first focus on Nanjing, Wuhu, Suzhou, and Jiaxing as the core areas for agricultural loans, and then gradually expand to the surrounding counties, towns, and villages in the four core areas. The implementation steps, in the first two years of operation, will focus on rural credit and production cooperative loans, increasing the operating funds for small farmers' farmland, so as to improve the production and net income per mu, and ensure that farmland management is changed from extensive to intensive, so that farmers' lives become more prosperous and the rural economic situation is improved. After one or two years, when the cooperative foundation is stable, it will further guide the establishment of cooperative treasuries in various counties and cities, and assist in the establishment of agricultural treasuries at all levels affiliated to the cooperative system, so that the cooperative system can be smoothly integrated with the agricultural warehouse network.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consulate General Holds Liaison Meeting on Material Control</h3>
<p>The Japanese Consulate General, in order to prevent Japanese people from violating control measures, the Economic Section police have decided to hold a liaison meeting on countermeasures against Japanese people's violations of material control once a month. The first meeting was held on the 14th of this month in the conference room on the fifth floor of the consulate, to discuss issues such as the punishment of Japanese people who have violated the measures.</p>
<h3>Developments in Trade Associations</h3>
<p>Trade associations in this city have been ordered to adjust their structures to adapt to the wartime system. Some of the trade associations for various major goods have been established one after another, and trade associations for minor goods are also preparing under orders. The developments in the various trade associations are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Iron and Copper Association</p>
<p>The Iron and Copper Trade Association has been designated by the Economic Bureau to have Zhang Haoru, Jiang Guiqing, and others as initiators, and a preparatory committee has been established to begin preparatory work and register members. The original Iron Industry Association and Steel Bar and Old Weaving Industry Association have also been instructed to merge. Members of the above two associations must also join this association and register for membership starting today (17th).</p>
<p>Silk Association</p>
<p>In addition, the Silk Cocoon Industry Federation, which was originally ordered to be in preparation, has now received an order from the Special Commodity Marketing and Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Industries, because the Ministry of Industries has designated initiators to start preparing for the silk industry. Since the nature of silk cocoons is the same as silk, and the Silk Cocoon Industry Federation does not fully comply with the newly promulgated laws and regulations, it should immediately stop preparing. Therefore, the association has stopped organizing and has merged into the Silk Association, which is being prepared by Cai Shengbai and others. It is stipulated that trade associations for silk cocoon, silk, and silk product manufacturing, sales, production, and marketing in various regions must join this association as members as soon as possible in order to unify association affairs.</p>
<p>Rubber Association</p>
<p>The Rubber Manufacturing Trade Association of this city has been ordered to organize and is actively preparing. Membership registration will be conducted for three days from today (17th) to the 20th. All rubber manufacturers in this city must join the association according to law in order to protect their business rights and interests.</p>
<p>Electrical Appliance Industry</p>
<p>The Electrical Appliance Industry Trade Association of this city has been designated by the Economic Bureau to have Ye Youcai and others responsible for preparation, and they are required to complete the report by the 20th of this month. Therefore, membership registration will be handled immediately. All large and small manufacturers related to the electrical appliance industry in this city, including electric motors, electric wires, light bulbs, radios, lightning rods, bakelite batteries, and small light bulbs, regardless of whether they have joined the association before, must register for membership by the 19th of this month.</p>
<h3>Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Market Conditions in Shanghai Last Week</h3>
<p>The weak trend in Shanghai's financial, industrial, and commercial market conditions remained last week. People are stable and quite optimistic about the future, because (1) the government authorities are expanding the scope of investigation and seriously enforcing the law against speculation and hoarding, causing great panic among hoarders who are eager to sell, thus completely eliminating the phenomenon of past hoarding of materials and the resulting lack of market demand; (2) credit is tight, and the branch of the Central Reserve Bank is assisting the National Government in curbing speculation and suppressing prices by stopping interbank lending and shrinking existing loans. Various banks and firms are tightening loans to customers, making it difficult for idle funds to flow into domestic speculation and hoarding; (3) although the Commercial Control Association is actively promoting the organization of subordinate institutions, it is emphasizing the smooth exchange of materials. At the same time, powerful banks and firms are paying serious attention to rural lending, revitalizing the rural economy and increasing agricultural production. Under a consistent optimistic outlook, finance is stabilized, industry and commerce are gradually promoted, and the prices of fixed goods do not move. Even the prices of non-fixed black market transactions are trending lower.</p>
<p>Rice Noodle Association</p>
<p>In addition, the Shanghai Rice Noodle Trade Association was ordered to reorganize into the Shanghai Area Rice Noodle Trade Association, and Luo Haitao and others were designated to be responsible for the preparation, which is required to be completed within a limited time. All Hubei-style rice noodle shops operating in this city must join the association and register their flour, rice, oil, sugar, alkali, and sweet potato flour.</p>
<p>Chemical Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Chemical Industry Trade Association has been designated by the Economic Bureau to have Wei Bangjun and six others initiate the preparation of organizational regulations. Yesterday, the first preparatory meeting was held and the following important resolutions were made: (1) Zhou Bangjun was elected as the director of preparation; (2) Drafting of the articles of association was started; (3) Personnel were appointed, etc. It is heard that the association's business includes cosmetics manufacturers, ink manufacturers, and kerosene manufacturers, who can all apply for membership. A public announcement will be made in the newspaper to re-register members in the near future.</p>

<h3>We Await the Manifestation of Facts</h3>
<p>— Sheng Dayuan</p>
<p>We, who are suffering in the depths of misery due to unscrupulous merchants hoarding and speculating, manipulating prices, felt as if we were seeing a rainbow after a long drought when we saw the regulations on punishing hoarding of commodities passed by the National Defense Council on the 4th of May. Especially the severity of the penalties stipulated this time made us see the government's determination. However, in the midst of joy, we could not help but feel apprehensive. Facts tell us that although the stipulated regulations are strict, those who implement them are human, and the difficulties they will inevitably encounter during implementation are within imagination. Will the rainbow ultimately remain a rainbow and not bring rain, or will it only bring a few drops of insignificant rain? We eagerly await the manifestation of facts.</p>
<p>Not long ago, the authorities vigorously investigated bank account books and cracked down on speculation, resulting in the punishment of a Morningstar Bank and a Han Gongbei. Of course, this was 100% appropriate, but it gave people the impression of "catching small fish instead of big fish" and, at the same time, led to countless rumors. The regulations passed by the National Defense Council this time are a continuation of the previous investigation and crackdown and are obviously a step forward, which we are of course delighted about. However, we hope even more for facts that will delight the public, and the sooner the better, because we really cannot bear it anymore.</p>
<p>After the regulations were announced on May 4th, prices fell on the same day. This proves that it is possible to suppress prices, as long as it is done. However, where there are generous illegal profits, speculators and hoarders will certainly spare no effort to find ways to evade the law or take advantage of loopholes and commit fraud. Therefore, in implementing these regulations, the government really needs the cooperation and supervision of the majority of people. The article "Strengthening the National Government and the Problem of Hoarding" published in the Japanese-language Continental New Report has stated that "Hoarding is the biggest obstacle to the implementation of the new economic policy. We will not hesitate to discuss it again and again, no matter how much we say." We hope that all newspapers and magazines in Shanghai will unanimously supervise, report, and support the government in implementing these regulations, so that all hoarders have nowhere to hide and those who implement the regulations have no way to be negligent or accommodate. In this way, the last days of hoarders are not far away, and the public is saved.</p>
<h3>Strengthening the National Government and the Problem of Hoarding (6)</h3>
<p>Having classified and described national capital above and criticized the relationship between national capital and hoarding, we will now examine the relationship between various enterprises in the concessions and hoarding. At present, there is a popular saying in the concessions: "Setting up a factory is not as good as opening a store, and opening a store is not as good as hoarding goods." Listening to these two sentences, you can see most of the distorted economic situation in the concessions. No matter how depressed production is, the concessions are still showing a golden age of investment. Moreover, under the current situation in Shanghai, investment has long lost its normal significance. Speculation and investment are simply not easy to distinguish. Considering this situation, let's criticize the activities of banks, business companies, insurance companies, and various factories. From the criticism, we raise the question of how the National Government should crack down on speculation, how to thoroughly investigate speculation, and how to seek to strengthen the National Government and stabilize people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>The Problem of Banks and Hoarding Since the Greater East Asia War, small banks have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain. Before and after the occurrence of the hoarding problem, this newspaper has detailed the issue of the reorganization and merger of small banks. Although Fu Feng Bank was punished for the hoarding problem this time, it is not just one or two banks that are engaged in hoarding. Observed objectively, the motivation, capital, deposits, and profit status of most banks, as well as other factors, are directly or indirectly suspicious of hoarding.</p>
<p>For example, a small bank with 3 million yuan of capital, even if all its capital is used for industrial loans or even agricultural loans, its profits may not be enough to maintain the bank's expenses. Furthermore, even if a small bank absorbs a huge amount of deposits, judging from the general trend of current deposits, it can be determined that only demand deposits account for the largest number. Then, how can it maintain expenses and operations by relying solely on loans? This is a very clear principle. Moreover, the motivation for opening a small bank is not to open it as a normal financial institution to carry out normal financial capital activities, but to use the bank as a facade to pursue commercial profits with high interest rates. However, they have learned from the experience since the Incident that the greatest commercial profits can only be obtained through hoarding.</p>
<p>When a small bank engages in hoarding itself or allows others to do so, it cannot engage in large-scale hoarding with its limited capital. Due to this reality, small banks have also developed the nature of institutions that mediate hoarding funds between large banks and hoarders. From the perspective of large banks, since the promulgation of the order prohibiting the commercial activities of financial institutions last year, they have not been allowed to engage in it openly. If they want to profit commercially, they have to rely on commercial institutions or even small banks that are not listed as financial institutions. As a result, all banks have become hoarding financial stations.</p>
<p>The Problem of Business Companies and Hoarding There are more than 500 large and small business companies. This has been said many times. Most of the more than 500 business companies were established around the time the financial institutions' ban was announced last year. It is clear that they are another agency for banks to do business. This is one person's view. Among business companies, there are of course powerful business companies with a long history that are not part of the speculative group. However, strictly speaking, it can be affirmed that business companies are groups that use people's trust in them to engage in speculative commercial activities between banks and enterprises.</p>
<p>In various countries in the world with modern industrial development, there are also forms of trusts and business contracts. In China, which is lagging behind in modern industry, the forms of trusts, business alliances, and business contracts have also been formed. However, Chinese business companies are different from needle organizations. Most of them take advantage of the purchase of factories, the search for Chinese shares, and other special phenomena to engage in speculation. They use the same form to invest in factories for the purpose of centralized management. Therefore, it can also be determined that they have a large amount of speculative hoarding.</p>
<p>However, the powerful people in business companies are all managers or chairmen of top financial giants in the concessions, and they all have powerful banks as their background and cooperate closely. Their future movements and the crackdown on them, as well as their proper development, are more noteworthy than the hoarding incident.

<h3>Thoughts on Six Years of Urban Life</h3>
<p>— Ling Zuren</p>
<p>Someone far away in my province recently asked me to tell him some of my thoughts on "urban life" over the past six years, and also said a lot of admiring things, the underlying meaning seems to be really in love with this international metropolis - Shanghai! But, I said to him like this:</p>
<p>…Whenever a clear object or event is placed before you, you always passionately love it at first, but if it never changes its image and quality and always maintains its consistent tone, then gradually you will tire of it. Is life not like this!</p>
<p>Of course, before I came to this city, I really loved it as you do now. However, after six years of friendship, I gradually feel that this old friend is bland and unremarkable, like a setting sun in the evening that has lost the climax of its previous strong radiance.</p>
<p>Although those magnificent 20th-century modern buildings—towering foreign buildings and wide streets—still build this city on the basis of prosperity and beauty, it is still worthy of praise, but to me, the impression it gives me is like a diluted cup of coffee.</p>
<p>You may not believe my words for the time being, but if you have the opportunity to live in this city for a few years in the future, you will remember these words of mine.</p>
<p>Perhaps someone as ordinary as me is not capable of obtaining the treasures of the advantages of "urban life" in the kind of ordinary life I am living now.</p>
<p>Indeed, I am vague enough about the advantages of life in this city.</p>
<p>Perhaps the comfort of those material enjoyments and the pursuit of sensual pleasures are the advantages of "urban life"! However, this advantage has only swallowed up the reputation and future of many people. Perhaps you also understand this level of advantage! Therefore, you are always worried that I may also be tempted by it.</p>
<p>Yes, in this city, who can grasp the firm belief that they will not be tempted? The soft and sweet jazz music, the soft jade and warm fragrance, the girls with red lips and white legs, charming eyes, and snake-like waists are enough to be tiring! Mai Mian Nao, Tai Er Meng coffee, has a strong fragrance!</p>
<p>Quickstep, waltz, fox trot, blues…beautiful melody! Here, I don't want to use words to lay out a clever smoke screen and obscure the facts, I have also been dominated by this beautiful melody!</p>
<p>One year, two years, three years…six years, I have lived in these urban advantages. In theory, I should praise this "urban life", but, where is its advantage; where is its beauty? I still don't understand, maybe I'm a little too stupid.</p>
<p>In just a few thousand words, it is of course impossible for me to fully explain my thoughts on urban life over the past six years, but I give it a conclusion: "Urban life", on a personal level, I feel that it is bland, not an ideal and fulfilling life.</p>
<p>Of course! When you read these words of mine, you should also be deeply disappointed!………</p>
<h3>Remembering Mr. Wei Jinzhi</h3>
<p>— Zhang Xinju</p>
<p>When I remember Mr. Wei Jinzhi, a figure with a flat top, a small beard, and a "Lu Xun style" who speaks Shaoxing Mandarin emerges in my mind.</p>
<p>Wei Jinzhi was a disciple of Lu Xun. He personally admired Lu Xun very much, and Lu Xun also praised him as an excellent peasant writer. He was from the same hometown as Lu Xun. Not only did he resemble Lu Xun in appearance, but his writing style also deliberately imitated Lu Xun. Mr. Wei always only wrote novels, and there were not many works. The collections include "Nanny One", "White Flag Bearer", "Autobiography of Seven Letters", etc.</p>
<p>Mr. Wei had a very long period of time teaching at McLaren Middle School. At that time, the author was studying at McLaren, and Mr. Wei was our Chinese and history teacher. His personality was very strong, his temper was straightforward, he liked to scold people face to face, and he never fired cold arrows behind people's backs to speak ill of people. This is what made Mr. Wei lovable, so the students respected and feared him.</p>
<p>Because Mr. Wei was from Shaoxing, his accent was quite humorous. His voice was rapid and short, which often caused laughter in the hall. The students always loved to imitate his tone—"Eunuchs are going to kill their wives," teasing each other. Sometimes we talked to him about Lu Xun's works, and he shook his head and smiled: "You are young and you don't understand Lu Xun yet. You can't understand Lu Xun's articles yet." Listening to his tone, it seemed that we were not qualified to read Lu Xun's works.</p>
<p>In 1937, Mr. Wei married his wife. The wedding ceremony was held in the auditorium of McLaren Middle School. I did not go to watch the ceremony that day. I heard that she was also a writer. I don't know her surname or name. I didn't have the chance to meet her. I don't know what she looked like.</p>
<p>Around August 13th, I only saw one of his short stories, "Mrs. Wang's Struggle," in the "Lu Xun Style." After that, I never saw his works again. I heard that he recently wrote a classical Chinese novel in the Society Daily under the pen name "Wei Niyong". I don't know if it is true.</p>
<p>Now he has given up teaching and gone into business. His eternally firm idea is that he is unwilling to work hard in any occasion, and he is unwilling to do anything that he does not want to do. As I am drafting this superficial and incomprehensible article, he does not know where he is running around.</p>
<h3>A Poet's Sorrow</h3>
<p>— Song Lian</p>
<p>Shaped like a swan but thin and long, having suffered the poison of education, this young man has little chance of success.</p>
<p>Indeed, literature is utterly powerless, a parasitic plant of long standing, the leader of all empty movements, so it is in times of war, so it is in times of peace, so it is now, so it will be in the future. Human art is about making money, building guns and cannons, manufacturing airplanes, creating madmen; it is certainly not something that can be accomplished with the twisting and turning of a pen.</p>
<p>However, what happens when one engages in literature! He, like other humans, needs to eat, to marry, fears the cold, needs to sleep, even at his busiest times, even at his most passive moments. Speaking of accomplishments, he was never behind in school, but the moment he leaves school, he loses his swaggering spirit and is squeezed at the tail end of "life," and with the slightest exertion, he will be flung ten thousand eight thousand miles away.</p>
<p>He never understands his friends, how can they be so at ease. Speaking of published works, there aren't many; speaking of the degree of effort, it doesn't seem to be as great as his. This will be a mysterious riddle. Can he explore it? Can he learn from it? Hmm! He really doesn't understand, really doesn't understand!</p>
<p>The wall is covered with vines, the bright green window is wide open, and if the sun shines on it during the day, it is so dazzling that it is almost impossible to find where the window is. To make it seem even more mysterious, the window glass is in the style of a church, yellow, red, blue, orange, making one recall the great architecture of the city of Babylon three or four thousand years ago, the "Hanging Gardens," longing and yearning, but never able to understand the exact number.</p>
<p>This is the residence of the ××× famous poet.</p>
<p>The poet, of course, cannot escape poetic sentiment anywhere; disheveled hair is poetic, clever speech is poetic, extravagant spending is poetic, shiny pants are poetic. And especially poetic, of course, is when inspiration comes, closing the window and letting the sunlight pour through the multicolored glass onto the writing desk, when our poet brushes his hair and sits down to write his masterpiece.</p>
<p>This swan-shaped young man now intends to consult such a handsome figure, although they are classmates, but when a frog sees it, it always can't help but scurry into the paddy field!</p>
<p>A gaunt figure began to wander at the foot of the beautiful wall. The moon emits a bleak light, and seems to show a feeling of being overwhelmed with emotion towards these two superficially disparate figures.</p>
<p>Two pairs of eyes finally met, one like a demon, one like a ghost, the poet poked a messy head out of the window:</p>
<p>"Who is it, groping around, are you planning something bad?"</p>
<p>"No! I, Chanming!"</p>
<p>"............"</p>
<p>The poet is writing poetry, sparsely filling a few lines on a scarlet letter with green ink. Next to it are seven or eight square glass-topped envelopes, all filled in with "No. 1, Village A, New Village, Taierfeisi Road, Miss Hu Yunzhi."</p>
<p>The poet quickly put away the letter, but a few lines had already leaked their scenery:</p>
<p>............</p>
<p>............</p>
<p>Cold Night—:</p>
<p>I want to gaze at your star-like eyes,</p>
<p>The god of love smiles,</p>
<p>The land sighs:</p>
<p>Obstinate humans</p>
<p>For you,</p>
<p>I bear so much cold.</p>
<p>For you</p>
<p>I have endured so much struggle to expand you</p>
<p>............</p>
<p>"Poet, is that all there is to it! I thought you deserved the title of 'Folk Poet'." The gaunt figure is now a hundred times braver!</p>
<p>The poet's answer is to cast a suggestive glance at the envelopes on the table, then slowly pull out something from the drawer and display it in front of the visitor—:</p>
<p>"Summary of royalties for last month: fifty-seven yuan!"</p>
<p>Using the pen to cross out words that are choked in the throat: "Tomorrow I'll give you something else to see in the ×× newspaper."</p>
<p>Tomorrow, on the newspaper with the smell of stale oil, it is clearly printed:</p>
<p>"..................</p>
<p>Cold Night—:</p>
<p>I am gazing directly at—</p>
<p>The beggar's eyes,</p>
<p>The stars sneer</p>
<p>The land only sighs:</p>
<p>Obstinate humans</p>
<p>For you</p>
<p>I bear so much cold. For you, I have endured so much struggle to expand you.</p>
<p>..............."</p>
<p>He then understood the poet's sorrow, the poet's expenses could not possibly rely solely on these fifty-seven yuan, he then calculated his own income, ah! Heaven ultimately does have eyes.</p>
<h3>A Sketch of a "New" Woman</h3>
<p>— Jin Ruting</p>
<p>Dedicated to W</p>
<p>It was already past ten o'clock, the sunlight that had been peeking outside the window at first, now boldly strolled in and lay quietly in front of the window. Downstairs, the voices of the servants discussing groceries were loud.</p>
<p>Miss Mei was still wearing a dressing gown, combing her hair in front of the mirror - she sat like that for a full hour, but in reality, it would be more accurate to say that she was scrutinizing her face, discovering the lines of beauty, rather than combing her hair.</p>
<p>"How beautiful..." She dropped the tongs, stared blankly at her face, and whispered softly. At this moment, along with the complacent joy, a feeling of being ridiculed surged into her heart. —</p>
<p>Yesterday, for her marriage, guests were invited to her home; the "bridegroom" was Associate Manager Zhang of ×× Bank, only twenty-five years old.</p>
<p>"A good match, a high marriage, the child is promising, and the family is noble..." After the guests left in the evening, the father shook his big belly and praised with satisfaction.</p>
<p>"Yes, that child is truly what is called refined and gentle, sits upright, and is extremely elegant in conversation..." The mother echoed: "You probably didn't notice, did you? The bridge of his nose is straight..." This was the mother's special discovery.</p>
<p>"In short, he has a blessed appearance and is promising!" The father drew the conclusion. Undoubtedly, he had already agreed to the marriage.</p>
<p>However, Miss Mei's evaluation was quite the opposite. In principle, she was a modern young lady of the 1940s. She had progressive, trendy new ideas, so naturally she would not agree with their pedantic views.</p>
<p>"Damn, blockhead!" In her dreams, she would never have imagined that such a marriage would fall on her. First of all, she fundamentally disliked the "matchmaker introducing, inviting guests" routine; "What matchmaker introduction! How could it be that a modern woman like me wouldn't have someone fall in love with me and propose to me!" And, according to her past fantasies, her "ideal husband" should be united with her in this way: for example, in the bright spring sunshine, when a hundred flowers are in bloom, she leans against the window and sings a sweet love song; somehow, his loud singing voice rises, and then the two embrace and entrust themselves to each other for life... Secondly, she believed that her lover would definitely be as burly as Errol Flynn or Liu Qiong; she often fantasized about romantic pictures: her lover suddenly hugs her, jumps on a magnificent horse, and gallops away. As for why he had to gallop away, she had not yet thought about it, but in short, her lover would never, and should never, be so bland, wearing a long gown, like a little old man; at the same time, the two of them would not be united in such a bland way. — Everything is not romantic enough.</p>
<p>"Does he think he's worthy of me?" She stood up straight, threw away the comb in her hand; a sarcastic sneer floated on her face: "Mom and Dad are behind the times! Their horizons are narrow!"</p>
<p>Thus, after admiring her standing, beautiful posture for a while, she walked to the desk in front of the window. According to her daily habit, after combing her hair, she would start coloring the photos of celebrities - the morning was spent like this. Coloring photos is an extraordinary art, so no matter the monthly exams or major exams in school, she never interrupted this compulsory art course.</p>
<p>Today, her job was to continue completing Diana Durbin's singing photo. Dipping some lipstick, she carefully applied it to the slightly opened small mouth. Suddenly, she stood up as if she had realized something, ran to the mirror, stretched out her mouth, and tried to imitate a charming look.</p>
<p>"As beautiful as Durbin!" Feeling satisfied, she returned to the desk and buried herself in her work.</p>
<p>"Mom told you to go eat, sister!" Her younger brother's voice, he didn't know when, was standing beside her.</p>
<p>"Got it, I'll be right there!" She said faintly, still working seriously.</p>
<p>"Sister, who is this going to be given to?"</p>
<p>"None of your business!" She seemed to be impatient.</p>
<p>"Can I see it?" The younger brother asked softly, reaching out his hand.</p>
<p>"Don't move!" She stopped his hand.</p>
<p>"What's the matter with letting me see?"</p>
<p>"I won't let you see it, what's wrong!"</p>
<p>"I have to see it!" The younger brother didn't show weakness either, simply snatching it away.</p>
<p>A romantic female artist is not to be trifled with. She flared up and punched him heavily: "Get out, you're not allowed to come into my room!"</p>
<p>"Okay! You hit me! I'm going to tell Mom!" The younger brother tore his throat with all his might, crying loudly, and stubbornly ran downstairs.</p>
<p>Then, the mother shouted loudly downstairs: "Mei, why did you hit your brother! Mom hasn't died yet! If your brother is wrong, you can come and tell me; it's not your turn to hit him!"</p>
<p>"I just want to hit him!"</p>
<p>"Oh dear! How can you be so rude! ... I'm telling you, it doesn't matter if you throw a tantrum in front of Mom! In a few days, when you get to the Zhang family, if you still have this temperament, your mother-in-law won't forgive you!" The mother babbled a lot, leading her younger brother upstairs!</p>
<p>"What Zhang family! I would want this kind of man!"</p>
<p>"What? What are you saying..." The mother was alarmed.</p>
<p>"Nothing! I don't want to!"</p>
<p>"Mei, girls shouldn't be so aggressive! The marriage with the Zhang family is my decision, you have no say!" The father, who was sleeping on the third floor, was awakened by the noise, his deep voice pressing down like a large stone, with great weight.</p>
<p>"I don't want to!" The father's scolding dissolved her stubborn defense, but this quickly turned into tears, and she burst into tears, falling on the bed.</p>
<p>"You have to want to, even if you don't want to!" The father did not pity her at all.</p>
<p>Miss Mei cried and cried - besides coloring celebrity photos, this should be her special art! The mother came to persuade her several times, but the answer to this gentle stroking was only impatient shouting! Thus, the mother, who could figure out her daughter's temper, simply avoided her!</p>
<p>At first, she kept cursing the Zhang family, her father, her mother, and her younger brother... Later, she gradually felt tired, and she sighed long, wiping the taut eyelids from crying; her whole body slowly relaxed.</p>
<p>"This is what is called a good match!" She was suddenly startled, and then, unconsciously, she thought of Chen Yanyan in Butterfly Dream; this was a victim of feudal forces. At this time, she couldn't help but feel complacent; however, after all, she had too few similarities with Butterfly Dream, she wasn't a prostitute, not to mention that she didn't have a Smart lover like Liu Qiong at all. This was inevitably a bit disappointing. So, she thought of "if only we had met before marriage," the heroines in the wedding night didn't match her.</p>
<p>"Got it! I am Hui in Spring!" Finally, she finally caught someone, overjoyed, and greatly excited! What Zhang family, what the father's categorical scolding were all thrown to the back of her mind! — It should be romantic enough for her fate to be the same as the characters in the movie!</p>
<p>So, she sang The Manchurian Girl...</p>
<p>In the evening, the mother bought a lot of sweets to resolve the grievances she had suffered in the morning, and also invited Miss Fang from next door to accompany her. The two of them talked, from Chen Yanyan's marital change to Gao Zhanfei's arrival in Shanghai, and then to Diana Durbin's marriage...</p>
<p>"I just finished coloring a photo of Diana Durbin today, you haven't seen it yet!" Saying this, Miss Mei opened the drawer and took out the photo.</p>
<p>"It's a pity the flesh color is too dark!" That one didn't appreciate it.</p>
<p>"That's not necessarily..." Miss Mei felt a slight annoyance, and then she pointed to the photo and said: "Look how beautiful this mouth is!" The answer she was looking forward to was: "Don't say it! Yours is even more beautiful than hers!"</p>
<p>"Mei, I recently got a personally signed photo from Chen Yunshang, it's really beautiful!" Miss Fang didn't join in the fun again, changing the topic and boasting.</p>
<p>"What's so rare about that! Just write a letter to Ziming Apartment and you'll get it!" Miss Mei pouted, unwilling to echo her.</p>
<p>"But she doesn't live there anymore!" Miss Fang smiled, "And she doesn't easily give photos to fans now!"</p>
<p>"Who said, that's not wrong, she still lives there!" Mei was not convinced.</p>
<p>"Really, she moved!"</p>
<p>"Nonsense, this is the 'air' she's putting out!" She shouted sharply, as if arguing about a serious, personal question; she said contemptuously in her heart: "In any case, I know more about things in the film circle than you do!"</p>
<p>"This can't be 'air'!" Miss Fang said with a smile: "Mei, this is what I bought yesterday. - The latest style!" She pointed to the leather shoes on her feet:</p>
<p>"There's nothing good-looking about them!" Miss Mei was completely sulking!</p>
<p>The conversation didn't mesh, and Miss Fang went home before ten o'clock.</p>
<p>"Yes, Mei! You can sleep too. Don't tire yourself out, Associate Manager Zhang will invite you to see a movie tomorrow!" The mother sent Miss Fang out and advised her with a smile.</p>
<p>"No, I'm not going!" She said coyly.</p>
<p>"Child! You're not being obedient again!"</p>
<p>"I'm not going, I don't have shoes!" Seizing the opportunity, she made her request.</p>
<p>"I just bought a pair of leather shoes last month, and now you say you don't have shoes?" The mother asked strangely.</p>
<p>"The style of those shoes is too old, I want to buy the kind that Miss Fang is wearing on her feet!"</p>
<p>"Don't make a fuss! Go to sleep quickly, we'll talk about it in a few days!" The mother secretly agreed!</p>
<p>"But, without shoes, I'm not going!" She acted spoiled, smiling inwardly - another pair of leather shoes!</p>
