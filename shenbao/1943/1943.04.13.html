<h3>世界戰局之展望</h3>
<p>目前世界戰局的重心，大體上可說是在北非洲突尼斯之戰，敵方以英國的第八軍美國的第五軍和叛離了貝當賴伐爾政府的法軍，所展開的「大規模的進攻」，已經有三個星期之久了。從兵員的數目和武器配備方面說，敵方是佔有絕對的優勢的；而且，據說道幾天又有英國的第一軍也參加了這一戰爭。相反的，軸心軍方面，在羅美爾將軍和亞爾尼姆將軍統率下的兵力，無寗說是相形見絀的。但是，數星期來，由於優異的戰略，和堅强的陣綫，以及西西里等處的聯絡接濟之便捷，能够堅持反擊英美和叛變的法軍，步步阻止其推進，除了突尼斯南部巳經有計劃地縮短防綫之外，在最重要的陣地和地區，始終屹然未動。這種以少數兵力抵抗三面圍攻的艱苦卓絕的防禦戰，可說與東錢進攻史城之役有着同樣重要的意義的。由於德義軍在突尼斯的堅守，至少已經得到如下幾個重要的收獲：第一，吸收着英美法準備反攻的大量兵力，阻滯其夢想中的「第二戰綫」實現；第二，爭取更充分的時間，以完成和嚴密義大利和地中海北岸的防綫，法國西北海岸和北海諸國的反登陸戰的戰備；第三，以最少的兵力，拖住最大的敵兵，而使德義聯軍在東綫作戰毫無西顧之憂；第四，保持世界戰爭的主動性，得以從容準備夏季攻勢之展開。突尼斯一隅德義軍巳經努力完成了道四大任務，目前正在日益接近決戰的階段，最後勝利的保證，就在於地中海上最短的運輸綫—西西里和比塞大間運輸錢的保持，和制空權的掌握。至目前爲止，我們絕對信任德義軍在這兩點的優勝。</p>
<p>由於敵方在北非突尼斯方面的所謂大攻勢的進展，是這樣出乎羅斯福邱吉爾他們意外的迂緩，直接影響到歐洲東綫的戰事之對軸心軍有利。德義方面，可以獲得時間，從容地從歐洲方面調集援軍，並且重新整理戰綫，展開攻勢，爭回冬季暫時失去的主動。在古班區和唐納茲區，這幾個星期來的戰役，已使新春以來的德蘇戰局完全改變了面目，而蘇聯的情報局也不得不承認德蘇戰綫「暫時的沉寂」了。但是，無論如何，這一戰綫依然爲歐洲戰塲上的主要的戰區，在突尼斯的戰爭未獲得結束以前，德義已有充分的時間部署這一戰區的主動與攻勢。未來的形勢，只要看（一）蘇聯對於冬季攻勢所造成的形勢如何處置，兵力如何整理，及新兵補充的程度與其實力；（二）德義在兵員之集結，和空中作戰的主動權之掌握達到如何程度；以及（三）英美再度喧擾着的「第二戰綫」的實際意義是什麼。從目前的實際形勢來看，第二點是德義保有絕對的優勢，第三點直到目前還只是看不見雨點的雷聲而已。至於第一點，我們從零落的電訊和消息中，自然不能作出斷然的結論，不過鑒於這幾天英國軍事團之赴蘇，以及蘇聯答允美國所發起的國際經濟會議等事實來看，雖在蘇聯本身，似乎也還缺乏充分的自信呢。</p>
<p>當然，我們決不能忽視世界戰爭的另一方面，大東亞戰塲這一方面。但是，這一戰塲的形勢，也許什麼人也看得淸楚，友邦日本的大軍，始終保持着戰爭的主動性和必勝的優勢。正面的消息，我們天天可以從報上看到，不必在這裏重複。我們來看反面的文章，在美洲，這幾天新到了澳洲外相愛優特，他是預備經阿根廷而赴華盛頓與美當局協議太平洋問題的，在途中，他就迭連發表了抨擊羅斯福邱吉爾政策的談話，充分表現出澳洲對於日益逼近的日本威脅的憂慮。同樣，逗留在英國的重慶的所謂軍事代表團，也是到處訴苦，恰與宋子文宋美齡在美國的活動相同，他們所得到的只是所謂民間的「熱烈歡迎」，而他們最焦急地要求着的挽救危亡的救援，是遭到了意外的冷淡。至於印度問題，由於英國當局之始終冥頑不化，殘酷地鎭壓着印度民族的獨立要求，情勢日趨嚴重。所有澳渝印的這種新動態，可以看出東亞軸心軍前途的光明。而日華滿和南方諸國的親善關係，也在空前樂觀的氛圍中發展着，連日西南太平洋日軍海空軍的捷報，和印緬邊境的新勝利，將是一九四三年世界戰爭軸心軍勝利的序幕。</p>

<h3>澳門通訉　西北角的靑海　礦產森林等蘊藏豐富　尙未開發的處女地帶</h3>
<p>— 金彥</p>
<p>「靑海黃金遍地」，當我們在這省走了些地方後，更信前人所言之不虛，然而這是全國所未開發的「處女地帶」，實不容長此荒蕪下去了。</p>
<p>就地位上講，靑海是外倚新疆，蒙藏分踞其左右，東北接連甘肅，東南界西康，位居國土之中心，而崇山峻嶺環抱其外圍。論資源則礦產，森林，漁牧，水利無不豐富，所以這更可以說是未來工業發展的理想區域。</p>
<p>記者到靑海，很幸運地有機會赴都蘭，去看茶卡鹽池，由西寗踏過日月山以後的一片大草原，沿着靑海湖的南岸走，歷一日半的行程，中間一夜，我們住在帳幕中過零下十四度的嚴寒，吃的是冷羊肉及利用牛糞舉火所燒的水，却未减少我們看那鹽池的勇氣，在草地上汽車風馳電掣的走，驚動了成羣　野馬和疾馳奔走的黃羊，在夕陽洛山的辰光，我們終於望見了那玉潔冰淸，銀色無垠的茶卡鹽池。</p>
<p>鹽池東西寬七十五里，南北長三十五　，週圍長一百七十五里，這廣大的鹽池，湖內所貯，全是深厚的一層結晶體，蘊藏量雖然這樣鹽富，去年度掏了五萬擔，這倒不是因爲掏鹽的方法，要有什麽技術上的改良，我們看那鹽工，用鐵勺下水一探，放在湖面上再經過一次冲刷，那就是潔白的上鹽，因爲這鹽是屬於冷結晶體，其成分高於海鹽。</p>
<p>鹽池的蘊藏量很難有正確的估計，過去有人按照每一立方公尺所貯的數量，再乘其面積，所得的數量是三萬萬噸，以戰前每年全國用鹽一百五十萬噸計算，足供全國二百年之用，但是鹽池的深度，在正中約有三丈以上，現在掏挖的海口，是靠邊際，其深度不過一丈五尺，其結層不過一尺寬。再下全是水分，這水中鹽的成分亦佔白分之二十五，並未計算在內。而且，這旣然是由海涸而成，則其四週地層內蘊藏量亦不在少數。雨後冲流池內再行結晶，又成鹽層，所以其估計數量，較實際所含的鹽是差相甚多。</p>
<p>更有一點未　探明的，是池內有無鹽岩，如其有之，則眞成了取之不盡，用之不竭的寳藏，否則將來我們工業發達了有如美國，每人一年平均用鹽四十八磅時，仍是有限的資源罷了。</p>
<p>然向就目前講，仍然可以利用這鹽池，把靑海造成工業的重心，因鹽爲工業所不能少的，是鹽鹹更是一切化學工業之母。</p>
<p>鹽靠其取給之多，故成本之低，非他處所能比擬，茶卡鹽池是屬於蒙旗，靑海王的轄區，鹽工全是蒙民，中央每年另給靑海王一筆費用，蒙民掏鹽每石給工資一元，鹽池附近的幾座蒙古包，除了畜牧之外，亦靠掏鹽爲生。</p>
<p>現在產量不多，是由於運輸的困難，今年因爲牛瘟流行，毛牛死亡者太多，擔任運鹽的番民，來者日少，產量更難超過去年。這裏鹽供銷地方本省之外，甚至運至川康邊境與甘省，集散地共五處，爲湼源，西寗，大通，魯沙爾，尙武莊五處，鹽池運到上述幾個集散地，每擔運價六十二元，西寗　七十二元，記者在鹽池所見的，除在鹽工以外，就是成羣駝運鹽的駱駝牛而已。</p>
<p>在記者由西寗赴茶卡鹽池的途中，經過海　草原地帶，在途中遇到的障碍物，是　不過來牛羊骨殖，尤其是臥倒的牛爲數更多，這固然看出今年牛瘟的嚴重，但是這骨殖隨棄於地，是太可惜了。骨殖是製造肥田粉的上好原料，更大的功用是做燐，這又是工業的必需品，也如靑海其他資源一樣，寗放在那裏而無人用。其實靑海境內，單就牲畜說，可以使我們抱無限的希望。皮類的出產品太多了，恐怕大家祇震於黑紫羔的大名，這不過是作奢侈品服用罷了。我們沒有地方取得產量的統計，就過去輸出說，每年亦有數千件，今年七月以前，是被統制的時期，不能自由運銷出省，使得西寗城的皮貨店生意冷落，如今是開放了，每件納稅二百八十元，即可自由運出。</p>
<p>皮革製成品在靑海省內，所見者甚少，這裏可以知道，就資源用途講，似乎還未進入工業的大門。記者除去看見軍被服廠有硝皮部份外，其他製革工廠之類，尙談不到。</p>
<p>就現在情形講，在牲畜身上收下來的資派，仍然是以羊毛佔首位。</p>
<p>靑海羊毛究竟每年產量若干，我們沒有找來一個正確的統計，大約說起來，四五萬擔總是有的，省當局對記者說，毛質尙好，今後不在改良羊種，而在如何繁殖羊隻。其實認眞的說，靑海羊毛過去在國際市塲受歡迎，乃是因爲羊毛織維硬而有光澤，適於織造地毯，如果用來製造呢絨料，成色要差，爲國內銷羊種的改良，亦有其必要。最近的例子說，新疆的綿羊，據說，每年產毛有十斤之多，甘一寗不過三斤，如其毛質相差不多，似乎有就新疆種羊殖繁的必要。</p>
<p>講到牛，靑海有名的是毛牛，（即釐牛）其次是黃牛及蝙牛，毛牛來自西藏，蝙牛係黃牛與毛牛相配而成，耕種與運輸大部份是靠毛牛，今年毛牛成瘟，蔓延甚烈，死亡者據說有一百二十萬頭之多，牛瘟之來，有人說來自都蘭一帶，其實都蘭比較尙好，最嚴重還是一角城，當記者經過湟源縣時，全城已死之毛牛，超過一萬七千頭。</p>
<p>靑海有名的馬和駱駝，都無確切的數字，僅知者，在前方衝鋒陷陣的騎兵所乘的馬匹，大都是靑海產。</p>
<p>論礦產，在西北那一省也難和靑海相比，就過去所知，中國的金礦是以黑龍江居首位，其實靑海的金礦，過去尙少爲人注意，儘管喊着「以法幣換金」，形容人工貴，淘金得不償失，說起來仍是有大批工人每日在工作着。講數量，記者沒有打聽，自不便猜測。</p>
<p>靑海的礦產分佈區，集中在都蘭，通西北到教煌，往西南到柴達木區，這裏包括金·銀·銅·鐵·鉛。硫磺·硼砂等類，不勝枚舉，此外鹼，石油蘊藏亦厚，祗是這些寳藏，不祇沒有開發，而且連初的調查，過去全沒有人　過，祇有祁速山脈日月山東科　的煤層用土法開採，其　量亦不少。</p>
<p>但是不管煤的　　是否有多少，將來的靑海工業發展，可以完全靠着電氣化，記者由蘭州赴都蘭途中所經過的享堂峽，老鴉峽以及扎馬前三處水流湍急，水力都很强，據專家的看法，發幾十萬匹馬力，三處都綽有餘裕，不祇可以造成未來靑海的電氣化，並且可以供給鄰省。現在湟水流域兩岸的水磨，接連的計算不淸，農業的社會究竟尙知道如何來利用動力。</p>
<p>資源的不能開發，受阻於交通的困難，眞的靑海電氣化了，則最好的交通工具，還是電車。講到交通方面，靑海湖不見得不能行船，也是最好的水上飛行塲，靑海廣大無垠的草原，更可以停無數的飛機。</p>
<p>記者祇短短地在靑海躭擱了十二天，已然感到講不淸，說不盡的資源，不容我們荒蕪下去了，靑海的大門需要實業界在各方面協助下前來開發。（三十二年三月十日寄）</p>

<h3>艾登訪美任務分析　露骨顯示英國懷抱的鬼胎</h3>
<p>（斯德哥爾摩二十九日特電）英國外相艾登，在美亘續了二星期間的活動，關於艾登對美協議的內容，爲各種謀略的宣傳所掩蔽，其眞相頗難把握。然而綜合到達這裏的各方面之情報來看，其使命在於防止英美蘇三國關係的破綻，則爲不可動搖的事實。而且關於此事的對策，其協議結果，並未得到何等的成功，也是明顯的事實。哈羅爾得。加林達在二十八日的紐約時報上報吿說：「美國常局所洩露的，其會談不出於探聽的範園，並未達到終局的會談」。這個報吿，可作爲上述事實的證明。但是艾登對美國當局到底作過什麽協議呢？作過什麽商量呢？——這只要把英美蘇三國間現存的基本對立以及彼此的協力關係，作一個正確的硏究，則事態的眞相，自會浮現出來了。以下試綜合各方面的情報而加以檢討：</p>
<p>艾登的主要任務，在於調整美蘇的關係，尤其是想緩和以戰後經營問題爲中心之美蘇的對立，這是難加否定的事實。即蘇聯的戰後方案，是主張恢復波羅的海三國，波蘭的東半，以及比薩拉比亞的舊領土；對之，美國則以大西洋憲章所包容之民族自決主義爲立塲，取着斷乎拒絕的態度，因此而釀成糾紛。處於其間的英國，其態度由前此邱吉兩的廣播及倫敦泰晤士報的社論，已表示得明明白白，乃是不惜犧牲歐洲諸小國而認許蘇聯方面的主張，更爲調停美蘇的那種對立起見，故而有這次艾登的訪美。不過英國所會以把蘇聯的要求一口答應下來，那是隱藏着英國傳統的老獪外交之狡計的，這却不能等閑看過。那狡計便是：</p>
<p>（一）目前問題，要緩和蘇聯對於尙未展開第二戰綫的不滿。</p>
<p>（二）後問題，對於德意志第四帝國勃興的威脅，要使蘇聯自背後擔當牽制的任務。（戰前英國施於歐洲大陸之勢力均衡政策，是使德法兩國互相對立抗爭，現在以法國的崩潰爲轉機，乃變爲專以德蘇對立爲基調之勢力均衡的新政策。）</p>
<p>（三）並且對於蘇聯之赤化世界的威脅，想預先以外交的讓步着先鞭，以圖抑制蘇聯的活動於一定限度。</p>
<p>（四）另一方面，英國於維持其帝國之必要上，極恐美國稱霸世界，尤其是她的伸足歐洲，對之，想和蘇聯握手，以阻止美國的稱覇歐洲。（這和美國在法屬北非擁立達蘭，季勞，對之，英蘇布置共同戰綫，以支持特戈爾，完全是異曲同工的。）</p>
<p>總之，英國所夢想之戰後計畫，無疑是想要和蘇聯協力，平分歐洲大陸，進而抑制蘇聯力勢的無限制擴大，同時儘可能阻止美國的進出於歐洲。一部分的情報則傳英國對於美國，也表示着有把大西洋的西半和太平洋水域的全面，委諸美國的勢力範圍的意思，俾在將來蘇聯的飛躍太過時，基督敎國家的英美，可以聯合起來，從海洋的東西兩端，去對抗蘇聯。那來，這無論如何，可說邸吉爾是在想學諸葛亮，打算着由英美蘇來三分天下，以圖三國之調和。可是美國對於英國的這種意向，却認爲事實上是背叛大西洋憲章，而抱着憤懣的態度。前美國駐巴黎大使威廉·布利特，曾在紐約作過這樣的演說：</p>
<p>「如果反軸心國家的一國，有蹂躪大西洋憲章的事時，則美國將以失望和憤懣，再度回復其孤立主義吧。」</p>
<p>這個演說亦可視爲把羅斯福的對蘇對英的感情，全盤托出來了。</p>
<p>除上所述外，艾登訪美的主要仟務，更有第二戰綫問題。英國由於下列各項原因，取着希望儘早實現第二戰塲的立塲。卽：</p>
<p>（一）恐懼德國進攻英國本土</p>
<p>（二）恐懼有被潛艇扼殺的危險；</p>
<p>（三）希望早些脫離戰爭苦痛</p>
<p>（四）有須一掃蘇聯和國內不滿的急務。</p>
<p>可是要實現第二戰綫，不用說，單靠英國獨力，是不可能的。因此，爲要在蘇聯面前有以交代，關於早速展開第二戰綫的事，乃不得不再去探聽美國的意向。然而對於第二戰綫的問題，美國的立塲，和英國大異其趣；英國是以對德戰爭爲第一主義的，但是美國在事實上，却處於非集中全力於對日戰爭不可的地步，故熱烈地要求着在對德戰爭完了後，英蘇必頻積極參加亞洲戰爭的保證。所以現在美蘇對立之更爲現實的原因，不妨視爲就是關於這種含有代價意味的第二戰綫問題之相互的謀略。前次加薩勃朗加會談，羅斯福的最大目的，是要引誘史太林，使蘇聯參加亞洲問題，作爲在歐洲展開第二戰綫的代價，可是結果完全失敗了。美國對蘇的這種不滿，在其後關於戰後計畫之白晝的幻夢中，暴露得很爲明顯，只要有機會，無時不想把蘇聯拖進亞洲的漩渦；可祭蘇聯則依然以斷乎的態度，尙未把這件事作爲重要的現實問題來看待；而英國，從其要使德蘇兩國全面的爭噬之那樣功利的立塲，對於這件事，也並不表示怎樣高興。現在蘇聯正訴說其獨當德軍的壓力，而美國則以其在太平洋獨當日本的强壓爲詞，徹底要把歐洲第二戰綫作爲亞洲問題的代價。（丁：譯自四月一日讀賣報知）</p>
<h3>僕僕風塵　宋美齡在美受奚落</h3>
<p>（阿根廷京城古田特派員二日發）自重慶軍事使節團熊式輝離去華盛頓以來，由於美國援渝的沒有誠意，美渝之間呈現着一九三八年以來最初的「空白」狀態。本年二月十四日，大吹大擂煊赫地蒞臨華盛頓的宋美齡，她的使命，是想怎樣地打破這僩空白狀態的。她一到該地後，便就會見記者團，赴議會演說，出席演講會，往復飛行於華盛頓紐約，芝加哥，舊金山等各地，運用她所擅長的美國風的英語。對於美國朝野，聲嘶力竭地嚷着「促進强化對渝援助，太平洋戰爭第一主義，」而席不暇暖地忙碌着。最近甚至顧維鈞也繼踪而來，和宋子文，魏道明等，共同栗六於側面工作，以爲她的聲援。但是對於她的這樣熱烈的活動，美國究竟發生着怎麽樣的反應呢？我們在這兒試來收集美國傳來的報道，以作關於宋美齡在美活動的間接報吿。</p>
<p>被玩弄的宋美齡</p>
<p>美國朝野以她爲中心之所有動靜中，最先令人感着的，是她在美國果眞受着衷心誠悃的款接與吾的問題。連日連夜的演說和接連不斷的夜會，終於使她一度昏倒。美國的報紙，雜誌，對於她訪美最大目的之「促進强化對渝援助，太平洋戰爭第一主義，」並不認眞提及，只喋喋於她演說的怎樣好，她儀態的怎樣動人，她衣裳的怎樣漂亮等等，用着給紅舞星，給歌劇名伶們捧塲的口調，胡亂敷衍，而故意避開她所懷抱的政治意圖的眞話。簡直說，這位閉月羞花沉魚落雁的「重慶西太后」，到底不出於給他們玩弄於股掌之上哩！例如三月一日她在紐約的馬奇松斯快爾公園二萬多聽衆之前演說時，時代雜誌載着滔滔達二頁之多的報道，全部是縷述着會塲的情景和這個貴賓的絕代容華；</p>
<p>「在宋美齡的背後幔着灰靑色的幕，慕上大書紅色的兩個漢字『勝利』。她穿着黑色長式的夜會服，戴着綠色的耳環，御着黑手套。她當夜的服裝，正是好萊塢大明星在數月之前創興出來的全世界最新的時行式樣。美國的記者，曾經在『宋美齡』的固有名詞之前，用着嫵媚，溫婉，驚才絕艷等二十多個形容詞：可是當夜的她，也可以加上三十多個如同那樣的形容詞的吧」。</p>
<p>然而關於演說的內容之介紹，和援助重慶等的話，却一句也沒有道及。又二月二十八日，她以第二個外國婦女（第一個是荷蘭女王維爾赫爾密那）的資格，在音樂悠揚之中，步上美國國會的演壇上時，紐約，華盛頓各報，也和時代雜誌同樣，全然當做趣味文章來寫，試舉出一個例子來看。</p>
<p>「在上院議塲，宋美齡穿着黑緞子的中國衣裳蒞臨着。等到那們炯然顯着好奇和贊敷的眼光的副總統華萊斯說守介紹辭後，她輾然地徵笑着，靜靜地向着放音器，作了亘續一點多鐘很是動人的演說，其中最使人銘感難忘的，乃是關於多立托爾將軍部下的一個飛行士的話。那位飛行士在重慶天空，用着降落傘跳下來的時候，向着趕得來的另國人，揮着手，高聲喊出來他所知道的唯一的中國話『美國，美國』的話，我們於此宛然見得了美渝親善的活影像來」。</p>
<p>如上那樣，不過是低調的一例。</p>
<p>宋美齡的生氣</p>
<p>不但是報紙，無論那方面，都是對她始終以這樣的口氣數衍着的。她對於這種低調的奉承話，終於生起氣來，當她繼續在下院演說時，就有着相當反感和辛辣的口調的諷刺，而把在上院的外交辭令，全然捨棄不用。她引用一九二八年寫她母校馬薩諸塞州韋爾斯利大學的同學之信說：</p>
<p>「我雖然是想到美國去，可是如果被認爲是請求美國派造軍隊而來，那是極所不願的。」那樣地把她自己訪美的使命說了一番生氣話之後，接着說道：</p>
<p>「美國國民是有着可以誇耀那輩在世界各地從事，戰鬥之美國兵士的權利的。可是現在的美國兵士，是駐屯於遠隔之地，在那兒和其他的反軸心的兵士們，一天一天地過着單調的生活以等待時機，這個事實却是不可忘記的啊。」</p>
<p>更對於在華的美國空軍之不活潑和太平洋戰綫的守勢，下着痛烈的諷刺，以間接地詰問美國援渝的沒有誠意。接着，父引用「看人挑擔不吃力」的一句中國俗諺，演述重慶獨自對日抗戰的苦悶立塲，對於英美的旁觀態度，作相當直截的詰難。最後她說：</p>
<p>「現在重慶所最需要的是飛機。只消有着飛機的供給，重慶必當成爲反軸心陣營中最有力的一翼，斷然地打給你們看。」</p>
<p>她雖那樣着實地說了一番不客氣的話，然而那時各報的報道，却夷然不以爲意，只有華盛頓郵報這樣說「宋美齡的演說，到底使下院議塲的全部，倏地流露着發窘爲難的神色來，」是個唯一的例外。</p>
<p>利已的犧牲</p>
<p>總之，宋美齡的訪問美國，是負着要爲那立於生死關頭的重慶打出一條路來的，至極深刻之使命的，豈知竟被包圍在那樣過於浮薄的煽情的與味本位的　圍裏，這是不是由於她自身的所謂迷惑的性格使然的呢，還是羅期福一派的狡獪政策所施展出來的呢？雖然是難於判斷，但總不曾和這兩個要素全然脫體的。</p>
<p>上回在白宮會見新聞記者團時，宋美齡在百數十人的新聞記者之前，儘量地運用着外交辭令：同席的羅斯福，據當時的美國報所表現，曾用着像「伯父撫侄兒」一般的態度，擔當着介紹宋美齡給記者團之勞。那時宋美齡對新聞記者委婉地說：「對於援助重慶的急務，是大總統所最爲關懷的，我是什麽都安心着而一惟仰賴於大總統。」她雖以那樣巧妙的表現，督促對渝援助；然而羅期福却這樣說：「萬事一惟上帝之命，」把宋美齡的銳鋒，輕描淡寫地閃過。</p>
<p>話雖如此，揭穿眞相說，美國的傳統政策，一視乎自己的利益。羅斯福爲要空襲日本本土而增强其在華空軍，原是旣定的事實，並不是爲着「援助重慶」，而和宋美齡的活動，也沒有什麽關係。（丁：譯自四月四日東京讀賣報知）</p>
<h3>德機襲美國　可能性極大</h3>
<p>據華盛頓來電，近頃芝加哥講壇報以下之美國報紙，咸舉最近完成之德國新銳長距離轟炸機之威力，介紹於報端，而指出「德國空軍之空襲美國本土，其可能性愈益現實化」，因以促美國人民之警戒。此種敬告是足代衰者，當推美國新聞報（Amerlca　Mercurles）所載亨利泰勒之論文。泰勒於其論文中云：「自法國布爾脫紐海岸至紐約，直綫距離爲五」千四百五十公里，此距離依照確實情報，則適在德國新銳轟炸機之行動半徑內。賽伐斯基以及其他美國之急進空軍論者，無不踴躍倡導轟炸日本本土之舉，使國民之目光，一唯西太平洋之彼岸是向，焉知美國國民，將自背後之大西洋，受到重大威脅。由於歐洲戰局之推移，迄今信爲絕對可避空襲之紐約及華盛頓，巳不能不覺悟其將受相當頻繁之空襲矣。」又據瑞典報紙之倫敦特電，則在英國亦復如此，倫敦之軍事專家輩，亦皆重視德國新銳轟炸機之性能，而指出有轟炸美國本土之可能性，並指出德國由於其潛艇作戰之激化，使英國在物質與精神兩方面，陷於逼迫狀態，目因「歐洲要塞」之完成，將扼殺英國展開第二戰綫之準備，以及其他之蠢動，今春以後，德國將對英國本土實行開戰以來最大規模之空襲，殊有其可能。渠等更謂德機空襲之方法，將爲以攪亂交通綫爲目標之猛烈的集中轟炸，固不待言，且似將同時施行傘兵降落之擾亂工作云。</p>
<p>當美國空軍正在喧嚷冉度空襲日本本土之際，盛傳德國有新銳長距離轟炸機出現，自背後威脅美國本土，乃使美國全土大爲震駭。此種長距離轟炸機，綜合外國電報所傳，爲梅薩斯米特公司所製之二六四型機，其構造及性能等，因嚴守秘密，無從得知，然其航程距離，則知達一萬五千公里，故自法蘭西之德佔領區而至華盛頓，可以從容行動。又東京至舊金山間八千公里，如運用得法，則以此機由東京直接轟炸美國本土，亦屬可能。傳德國軍部方面，最近屢屢以無綫電廣播，預告；「爲報復美機之空襲柏林，德國空軍巳有轟炸美國之準備，」對之，美國方面乃趕聚於其海岸錢上，準備五百餘架之空襲察知裝置，戰戰競兢於德機之襲來。（丁：譯自四月三日讀賣報知）</p>

<h3>崇德老人的嘉言懿行</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>聶雲台先生之太夫人崇德老人，於去年十二月三十日逝世，亨壽九十有一，擇於今日在靜安寺二〇二八號聶宅領帖。崇德老人一生嘉言懿行，足爲當世則效者，不勝枚舉。是篇所述僅摘一二，聊資景仰云爾。</p>
<p>崇德老人聶曾紀芬女士，是淸季一代偉人曾文正公的幼女，在淸咸豐，二年（公元一八五二年）陰歷三月三十日誕生於北京，正是太平軍在廣西起義的時候。自幼秉受文正公的家敎，以後的思想言行，便都順着文正公的傳統，幼時，隨侍文正公轉輾各省，飽經變亂，洞察國家社會的弊害所在，而對一般平民之流離顚沛尤表同情，益以文正公的督敎，所以特別勤儉好學，至二十四歲，歸衡山聶仲芳先生。</p>
<p>崇德老人最可使人效法的，是她的一切努力不只是爲着一身一家的安富尊榮，而處處爲別人家的安樂與榮譽打算，具有「濟人之困」和「與人爲善」的道德。自民國紀元以來，留居上海，漸與耶穌敎中人往來，見其慈善醫藥，服務社會之精神，認爲足以針砭社會上自私忘公的弊習。欣然接受，於民國四年受洗禮，每早晚必跪而　天，微叩其首，至百數十，所祈求者，却是世界各國早復昇平，國家社會多出竇哲，絕不涉及自家私事。試問今日一般知識階級的婦女，有幾個能爲世界國家社會而如此虔誠祈禱的？我們不能不特別敬佩崇德老人，並願我婦女界有志者起而效法。</p>
<p>崇德老人之愛世愛國，濟助他人，決不祇表現在對上帝的叩首祈禱上面，而是切切實實地在實際生活中表現的。試讀她的「廉儉救國說」，他說：「嗜利而以當驕人，爲人類同有之惡根性，世界禍亂，皆由於此，惟我國古聖賢深知其故，故其爲政立敎，推崇德義，而貶抑富豪，孔子言，君子喻義，小人喩利。孟子以孳孳爲利爲盜跖之徒。又述陽虎言，爲富不仁，爲仁不當。又以商賈壟斷市利爲賤丈夫。漢賈誼晁錯爲我國大政治家，深斥當商大賈豪奢之行，妨害民生，敗壞風俗，淆亂禮制，言之痛切。以故數千年來賴禮敎維持，以社會淸議之制裁，成無形之法律，富豪貧宦，稍有忌憚，降至今日，輸入歐風，尤以英國爲最，尊富人曰上等人，稱美豪奢，賤視儉素，學者且從而爲之，風氣爲大讓，而國事不可爲矣。」這幾旬話，使今日一般豪富讀之，能不面紅耳赤，而內心自疚耶！</p>
<p>但是她也決不炎炎大音，沽名釣譽，她自幼就在動儉的家風中長大的。因爲曾文正公赤手空拳，出膺艱鉅，那時朝野酣嬉，習於虛僞，軍事吏治，腐敗已極，無可撥之餉，無可戰之兵。文正公以鄉紳任團練，進而總制各省軍務，總兵至十餘萬，以廉率屬，以儉治家，誓不以軍中一錢寄家用，終能造成風氣，與一時將吏以廉潔相勉，才能和衷共濟，完威中興大業。崇德老人自述她的幼年生活說：「先公常欲維持鄉居生活狀况，平日衣服不准用絲綢，一日客至，予著羽紗襖，綻有闌干，客去而文正公入，以目注視，問母云，滿女（指崇德老人）何華好？母亟答曰：適見客耳…………予等紡紗續麻，縫飪烹調，日有定課，幾無暇刻。」其實，不僅幼時，她在四十餘以至八十一歲高年，尙以一機相伴，以女紅爲樂，從未稍求安逸。現在所謂摩登婦女，恐怕其身份宮貴未及崇德老人甚遠，而早已惟以宴樂爲能，視女紅爲卑賤了。</p>
<p>老人如此勤儉，和她幼時的家敎極有關係，文正公曾爲她規定功課，早飯後，做小菜點心酒醬之類（食事），已午刻，紡花或績麻（衣事），中飯後，做針黹刺綉之類（細工），酉刻（過二更後）做男鞋女鞋或縫衣（粗工），曾家男女，於看，讀，寫，作四字，缺一不可；婦女於衣，食，粗，細，四字缺一不可；每日立定功課，食事每日一騐，衣事三日一騐，細工五日一騐，粗工每月一騐，他們有二句口號「家勤則興，人勤則健」，「能勤能儉，永不貧賤」。但她也很用功研究學問，他自己的年譜中說：「惠敏公長女廣璇，許嫁於合肥李幼仙，其夫家欲其讀書，惠敏因逐日親爲講授綱鑑歷史，的余輒從旁聽焉。其後惠敏無暇多講，乃自行點讀。署中有文正公構造之船廳中貯製造局所作地球儀器極大，徑約六尺，余輩於是粗知地理，粟誠公夙好算學，爰以天元勾股開方卽近世所謂代數幾何者授余，頗能解悟，仲嫂郭夫人亦常相從討論。文史讀書之樂，此時爲最。」老人不僅自幼好學自修，而出嫁後僞是好學不倦。她在自己的年譜中說：「惠，敏夫人自外洋携歸絨織衣袴，綫織衣邊諸物，爲當時所不易見，余叩以製法，略得一二，每於暇時觸類旁通，稍出新樣，旣而與傳蘭雅君之夫人時相過從，傳君即爲製造局編譯新書者，其夫人嫻雅篤厚，與余相得，因悉傳其法，彼時歐西婦女亦深重家庭手工，余感於外國語文與科擊之重要，因命其昌其杰兩兒逐日從傅夫人學。」更爲難能可貴的，是這種好學精神，至老不懈，，日書金剛經不倦，且不以自學爲足，數十年間，隨時以所學轉授他人，以至婢女輩，這種「即知即傳」，「與人爲善」的熱忱，正是我國今日所需要發揚的偉大精神啊？</p>
<p>最後，我們要說明老人爲一般婦女不可及的地方，就是樂善不倦他常常自己刻苦，而對於救助他人，特別是對於社會公益，總是爭先恐後，爲了救助貧病，常不辭勞瘁，深夜親自製藥，這種宗敎家犧牲一己，以爲人羣服務的精神，豈不正是我國今日所最感缺乏的嗎？我們今日爲崇德老人撰文致其崇敬之忱，所以和普通爲人作傳叙誌銘之類最大不同之點，就在於此。我們不想替已死者作溢美之詞，然而像崇德老人這樣努力向學，熱心行善，愛世愛國，即知即行，八十餘年如一日，這種精神與行動，實足以風末世，那麼我們又安得不爲之爲文表揚？今以崇德老人自己的話，給東本文：「顧事林曰：「國家興亡，匹夫有賣」，我則曰「匹婦尤有賣焉。」斥華美之服飾用具，勤儉刻苦，以激厲男子，共造成良好之社會風習，培養國家之元氣，保全世界之安寗，非我女子之實乎？願我女同胞，勿以爲老生常談而忽視之也！」（見「廉儉救國說）</p>

<h3>籌謀改善菜場制度　力求分配制簡易化　疏通來源抑低物價　檢查食物以重衛生</h3>
<p>兩租界各有關當局、對於各菜塲現行制度、有所商榷、據云其原因爲欲抑制菜塲食物價格、及改善分配及檢查辦法、茲將各情錄下、</p>
<p>疏暢來源期抑物價</p>
<p>菜塲物價之抑制、當局雖盡力爲之、但因菜塲食物本身之來源暢滯無定、菜塲食物由鄉間經過運輸商以及批發商、而至零售商正式出售之手續上各項問題較爲複雜、致未見十分有效、但各有關當局、刻已積極設法、以彌補上項缺憾、其辦法大致使分配制簡易化、及來源暢通、</p>
<p>檢查食物防止傳染</p>
<p>同時並爲維持公共衛生、防止傳染病之流行、對於菜塲食物之檢查工作、亦決求求完密妥善、衛生處當局已決定在舉行夏令防疫運動之前、先行實施各菜塲檢查食物新制度、查此項新制度、業由衛生當局擬定、</p>
<h3>地院看守所　稻草堆失愼</h3>

<h3>簡訊</h3>
<p>視察南匯淸鄉　上海特別市聯絡部長泉大佐、於本月十日、率領隨員至南滙淸鄉地區視察、當日完畢返滬、</p>
<p>冒名募捐被捕　近有人假借社會聞人名義、利用慈善機關、分電各界募集捐款、中飽私囊、前日新閘捕房華探在湖北路拘獲是案案犯樊炳坤黃寅生郭文卿金寳淸向伊庭姜友生等六人、昨晨解院、被吿等在界內犯案頗多、候查明再核、</p>
<p>婦女福利會義校　本市婦女福利協會主辦之婦女義務學校第一校於昨（十二）日正式開課、第二校定於十五日開課、兩校均分初高兩級課程、歡迎失學婦女前往報名、</p>
<h3>短評　緊記着走路規則</h3>
<p>昨天是本市第四度舉行防空演習的第一天，全市區內，終日在演習狀態中，參加演習的在事人員，全體出動，一聲警報，立刻依照預定規則，執行職務，寓緊張情緒於沉着應付之中，這是足以稱道的。</p>
<p>可是，我們再看路上的行人們，雖則人行道兩旁，都有繩索圍攔，而許多人還是走路不靠左邊人行道，以及穿梭似的隨處跨越馬路，甚者把攔繩衝斷。這種不守秩序，不守規則的能度，在戰時的今天，實在要不得的。</p>
<p>馬路兩旁攔園繩索，其用意是在束縛行人在行人道上走。本來，我們現代公良應當每個人具備守秩序守法則的善良習慣，根本就用不着形式上的束縛。所以，我們也可以說，這種束縛，是給我們精神上的一種警吿。那來，每個人應該各自知趣的自動的遵守行路規則，爲甚麼一部分人還不能辦到，寗願受這種精神上的警吿呢？</p>
<p>我們盼望甲長和家長，懇切的向本甲和本家每個老幼婦孺解說，必須把這個起碼守法的事做到。緊記着：「走路靠左邊大行道，不隨便穿越馬路。」務使今後演習時馬路兩旁不見攔繩，而人人守法行路。</p>
<h3>虎列拉預防注射　將嚴厲實施</h3>

<p>昨日本報發報時間七點正</p>
<h3>經濟界</h3>
<p>政府爲當局派員開始激查本市囤積投機，審查各銀行　目以來，日來貨價上漲趨勢，已見相當戢止，尤以棉布市一况，趨勢平度，人心下游，昨龍頭細布，四君子嗶嘰，桃花女士林各布，做價均較上　六爲低，且有續疲之象。</p>
<h3>評言　銀錢業與工廠貸款</h3>
<p>嘗考世界各國工業的發展，完全以金融業爲後盾，蓋工業與金融，似輔車　齒的相依，金融界與工業界叫又若昆弟手足之相親，在在應彼此提携合作，以利業務的進行。已往金融界曾有組織工業貸款銀團，爲工廠的後盾。雖以時局多故，迄未實施爲憾。最近銀錢業同業公會，爲防止利用商品擔保通融資金助長囤積居奇起見，隊決商品擔保放款，限於各業公會會員。換言之”今後銀錢業之放欶，以工廠爲主體，擔保品以工廠出品及原料爲對象，此實金融業放款之正常辦法，値得提倡，更値得推行。苟能本此方針，切實做去，則今後工廠在金融上得以周轉靈活，在生產上，可以儘量發展，中國工業之復興，或有實現之希望。信金融業於工廠貸款，應注意於下列三端端：</p>
<p>（一）應注意於工廠術方面，時時派遣技術專家，予各工廠之改進，俾成本减低，出品加速，以達增進效能之目的。</p>
<p>（二）應注意於工廠安全方面，凡房屋之構造，機器之排列，以及原料貨物之安置，當時時注意於安全方面，俾放款可不致蹈於危險之境地。</p>
<p>（三）應注意於工廠原料之來源，與成品之出路，隨時予以資金之融通，或多做抵押放款，或推行承兌櫃票，俾一份資金，可以做多份的營業，此爲扶植工業之最良方法。</p>
<p>同時，希望工業界自身應知今後業務，當完全在本位上努力，不作業外之貿易，不營軌外之囤積，專心在製造上求質的改進，量的加多；在推銷上圡主顧的滿意，與各地販賣商之熱心經銷，俾商譽日增，藉以取得金融家的信任，這是工業家需要自動努力的。</p>

<h3>上月份之呢羢市</h3>
<p>三月份呢羢之市面，回顧往年逐月中，市勢最爲緊俏，初旬不如中旬爲堅，中旬至下旬更硬，良由環境之互異耳。前所申請提增限價一節，在上月十二日當局已正式批準，由同業公會印送新限價單於各會員店號，本廠貨加三成，東貨加三成半，英貨加四成，今庚全國商統會正式成立，呢羢移動毋庸再打運單，同時規定營做批發者，不能兼營零售，零售店家不能帶做批發，乃新店家之加入同業公會者甚夥，同業公會方面，因辦事繁忙，開支增大，月費改爲十元，入會費改爲一千元。至呢羢之市勢，因毛絲紗諸原料枯乏及昂驕，呢羢現貨頗形缺乏，兼可自由車送後，人心驟轉興奮，求過於供，行情節節躍升，迨至月底邊人心更俏，流通籌碼大都軋缺，一般門莊零售商店，依然將貨囤藏，不肯陳列標價出沽，蓋限價雖已加三四成，七八成至一倍餘售出者亦有，是以欲購上身之呢料，非託熱友代辦，不易購得也。</p>

<h3>希望根絕囤積</h3>
<p>國民政府這次特派財政部次長陳之碩，實業部次長袁愈佺兩氏來到上海，澈查全體工商界的投機囤積，一俟兩氏返京，預料即將決定防止囤積的具體政策，着手實行租界經濟界也趁這次的機會，協助國府防止囤積，促進安定民生，復興經濟。同時各方希望國民政府對於這次激查囤積，弗僅作一時的措置而了事，爲繼續推動根絕囤積的政策起見，必須作下列的工作。</p>
<p>（一）在滬設立澈查囤機機關</p>
<p>指導上海工商界的駐滬機關，計有實業部駐滬辦事處，財政部駐滬辦事處，檢查金融機關事務處，保險業監理局等？然而這些機構，都很貧弱，其實力還不够指導參戰後的上海經濟界，尤其是以管理金融爲目的而新設的檢查金融關事務處，將更感困難，爲指導複雜的上海經濟，至少要設立一個由部長階級大員來主持的檢查金融工商機關的機構，假使不如此謀水久之計，今後每逢大囤積事件發生而派財政部，實業部，要員來滬，作短時間的澈查，這種臨時辦法，實不足以防止病入膏宵的上海囤積事件。</p>
<p>（二）囤積處罰令的公佈</p>
<p>據七日公佈的國民政府令開，凡經營投機買賣，操縱市價，擾亂市塲者，一經調查屬實，不論何人，均即呈報最高國防會議，決定特別治罪，其查獲之物資，悉數沒收，但是一般人認爲把治罪法令公佈出來，是防止囤積，安定民心上最要緊的辦法。（雲鵬：譯自四月十二日大陸新聞）</p>
<h3>譯論　國家資本的發展</h3>
<p>訪日的陳特使，十日在帝國飯店會見新聞記者，解答各記者提出的問題，陳氏在答語中，說明參戰後的中國國民運動，以三個根本方針爲目的而推進。這三個根本方針，第一個是從個人主義向國家主義前進，第二個是從自由資本主義轉向到國家資本主義，第三個是從狹義的國家主義發展到國家　團主義。這幾點目標，和去年一月在精衛氏在新國民運動綱要中所述的完全相同。汪氏會說三民主義爲什麼在過去不能完全實現，原因是民族主義忘記了大亞細亞主義，民權主義忽略了民主集權制度，民生主義不能使國家資本發建，在這短短數語之中，有沉痛的自我批判和反省。</p>
<p>我們對於汪精衛，陳公博兩氏的見解，完今同意，尤其是認爲謀國家資本的發展，應該富作今後國府努力的重心。國家資本的發展，孫中山先生早就注意到，想藉此來節制個人的資本，國家資本的發展，不僅有助於社會政策的側面，就是建設新中國，增加生產，也有賴於國家資本的發表，可以說是唯一的終南捷徑，明治維新以後，日本能從速發展經濟的最大原因之一，也是靠了龐大的國家資本，這種事實表現出來的成績，此際應該回顧到的。</p>
<p>國民政府努力動員民族資本，對於其活動，當然應給予充分的保證，同時素洪軍慶利用，對國府報以白眼的舊財閥，不應再抱戀戀不捨的態度，要自謀資本的振作，自已來創造基本產業，採取積極的態度。需要巨大資本的產業，由國家去經營，至少官商合辦，或在創設期中由國家給予保證實施這種辦法？國府方有飛躍發展經濟的希望。而且在中日經濟合作上也是一個最好的基礎。我們希望國府當局放出些勇氣，認眞從事這個問題，以求其實踐。（雲鵬：譯自四月十二日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>保險業經紀人　登記期限展緩　展至六月五日截止</h3>

<h3>雜談環境</h3>
<p>— 茹靈</p>
<p>一個朋友走了，他留下了一封信，說：「環境不好，我決定走了」。另一個朋友，從遼遠的地方寫信來，說那邊環境不好，打算來了。走了，來了，都說環境不好，作怪，環境影響一個人的事業一至於此嗎？</p>
<p>說起環境，總不免使人想起三國紛爭的故事來，魏得天時　，蜀得人和，吳得地利，各有環境，結果還是讓司馬昭佔了便宜，所以直到現在，我始終認爲環境不足以影響人的一生。</p>
<p>說在艱苦的環境中，能卓然自立，努力奮鬥，愈是環境惡劣，愈能使人立得住脚跟，這已是人人會說的老生常談。但是我們仔細地辨別一下，細嚼一遍，平凡的常談畢竟是有穩思的，一切偉大的發明及事業家，未必全是從良好優美的環境裏跑出來的。文人拿筆桿兒的，都知道「文章窮而後工一的話，杜甫在銅駝荊棘裏產出了他偉大的詩篇，我想不必再用這件事來　喩環境和事業的關係，用通俗的說法，瓦特發明蒸汽機，先只靠一隻茶壺，愛迪生少時發明就在一間後院的茅屋，史托華夫人用包裹的黃紙　稿紙，創造了她那篇「湯姆叔的茅屋」的傑作，至今文壇傳爲美話。同樣，大音樂家蕭邦偶然靈感一動，在信封後面寫成「聽，聽！這趣劇」這支名動一時的樂曲。如果說惡劣的環境裏產生不出偉大的事業，上面這些例子更足以反證這種說法。</p>
<p>辛克萊路易斯在他的一篇「情醫」小說裏，挖苦紐約一座基金充足設備堂皇富麗的醫學研究會，說凡是眞正科學家，他不必需要什麼堂皇設備的儀器室，僅把他自已屋頂下的擱樓充做研究所，給他幾根牙籤幾枝玻璃管，他便可以埋頭研究起來。這不是更可以說一聲環境不足以妨碍人的意志與事業嗎？</p>
<p>處於「入表同昏，萬民一慨，」遍地烽火的今日，還是守住自己固定的環境，努力奮鬥，別再徬徨吧！</p>
<h3>趣味與人生</h3>
<p>— 胡若流</p>
<p>「趣味」對於「人生」在畢業方面看來，是成功事業的原動力，無論什麼事，你能避免苦悶，時時刻刻運用趣味於你的事業上，就會努力去工作</p>
<p>但是另一方面看，許多　失敗是沒有趣味，因此對於任何事都得苦悶，無聊，於是把「努力去工作，創造新事業。」這個念頭打消了。</p>
<p>梁啟超氏曾經說過：「中國人見面最歡喜用的一句話：「近來作何消遣，」這一句話我聽着便討厭，好像生活得不耐煩了，勉强找些事來消遣。一個人若生活於這種狀態之下，我勸他不如早日投海，我只嫌二十四點鐘小能擴充到四十八點鐘，不够我享用。我一年到頭，不肯休息，問我忙什麼，忙的是我的趣味。」</p>
<p>梁氏所說的人，就是苦悶息者，結果是一事無成，梁氏自己呢？我覺得值得我們倣傚，因爲他做事完全是用「趣味」去鼓動他的事業，結果是受人敬仰。</p>
<p>但是，有許多人趣味是有的，可是運用不得當，誠如梁氏所說：「賭錢……喝酒……做官……諸如此類，雖短時間內像有趣味，結果會鬧到「沒有趣味一齊來！」所以我們不能承認他是趣味，凡趣味的性質，總要以趣味始，以趣味終，所以能爲趣味之主體者，莫如下列幾項：（二）勞作、游戲（三）藝術（四）學問。」</p>
<p>凡是趣味，我們也應該用在正當的事上，至少對於事業是有幫助的，</p>
<p>所以，我們要明瞭它的眞識；它不自外來的，目而從內心出來的，譬如；食諫果，苦在前，甘在後，一定要不絕的努力，得到相當的成功，趣味自然濃厚了。</p>
<h3>時代的苦悶</h3>
<p>— 川我</p>
<p>有着奔騰澎湃的熱情，像大海波濤般的洶湧偉壯，這是不可忽視的力量，這是靑年活力的源泉；可是現實的社會往往却是一個摧殘靑年，愚弄靑年的塲所，牠竭力抑制靑年熱情的奔放，和撲滅靑年富有活力的火焰；牠不能引導靑年走向奮發之途，更拒絕他們踏上更新之路！處在這環境中，靑年底勇氣在在地被折磨着，减削着，眞所謂「道高一尺，麽高一丈，」然而有着堅持到底的勇氣與毅力，永不爲社會上的魔道所克服的靑年當然是不少的。</p>
<p>一般自命爲「飽經世故」的其實是舊社會的俘虜的長輩，更「諄諄地」「敎誨」着靑年：「學點做人應付的本事呀！」「你這種態度是要在社會上碰壁的呢！」「手段要圓滑點，態度要會應酬點，這才會做人不吃虧。」「……，」諸如此類的話不勝枚舉，但概括地說一句就是命令靑年向社會屈服，向舊勢力低首，根本消險靑年底改進社會的理想和靑年底大我無私赤火一般的偉大精神！他們是靑年底罪人，他們「推己及人，」企圖把自己的懦弱的失敗推到下一代再讓他們去担存；雖然，另一方面也可以說是爲了下一代的「好，」然而這「好」我們是可能接受的嗎？接受了這　好，」無異的成爲無用的「應聲蟲」和仟人宰割的綿羊，接受了這「好」也就無異拋棄了自身對於社會所食的使命。然而不接受嗎？社會的冷酷和人羣的鐵面是足够使你沮喪頽廢的，而且足能使你淪入孤獨無援的境地：眞的，現實對於靑年的無情的打擊是太大了，使他們感到莫大的痛苦，於是逝去的可戀的夢影襲入了沉思中，捉住它吧，也許倒可以得到溫郁而甜蜜的安慰；同時，在失望之餘，呆滯的心也可能被帶向遙遠的將來，在那裏彷彿見到一綫希望的光，朦朧中抱着它小放也未始不可慰藉一下失去了溫暖的心。——但是，這是悲哀的事實，脫離了現實的靑年在嘆息和憧憬中失却了活力。</p>
<p>然而，靑年底意志頽敗能完全歸咎於社會嗎？不，這責任的一半還該由靑年自身去担當！無論怎樣，現實是一個人類强度的試金石，在每個時代的訓練中，强者會毅然直立，弱者却終被淘汰；而且，沒有艱苦時代的洗禮，偉大的人是不會產生出來的，因此，生於今日的靑年，相反可以說是一個時代的幸運兒，我們正應該歡呼雀躍呢！</p>
<h3>經騐的三部曲</h3>
<p>— 百廖</p>
<p>工每天要經過一條路，其實我不必經過這條路，不過因爲人總是喜歡走近路的，所以我每天都要經過它。這條路並不好，如果用平坦，康莊等詞來形空它是不配的；它只可以說是粗陋。和高低不平。</p>
<p>可是我不怕它粗陋和高低不平，單純地走了這條路近。</p>
<p>一天，兩天，三天………</p>
<p>今天，這巳經是將近一個月以後的一天了，我又走過這條路，爲了它的近，爲了我要增加我的脚跡，但是今天我發現這條路異常平坦。</p>
<p>異常平坦，當然不是說平坦得同平滑的柏油路一樣，不過比起起初是平坦得多了。它平坦是爲了我的走，我的脚跡？不因爲有許多人的走許多人的脚跡。</p>
<p>這時我記起魯迅先生的一句話了：</p>
<p>路是人踐踏出來的。雖然我很久之前就曉得這句話，但是到現在我纔體味到這句話。</p>
<p>知曉經騐是可貴的，體騐經騐更爲可貴，實行經騐眞正可貴。</p>
<p>靑年好友！努力知道你的經騐吧，努力從生活中體騐你的經騐吧，更努力在生活的無論那一部分實踐你的經騐吧！</p>
<p>經騐是人生最寶肯學識。</p>
<h3>根</h3>
<p>— 辛波</p>
<p>大根在看着陳列了待沽的竹器　和木器。他在研究牠們，那一種式波樣新鮮好看，那一種製作精工，那久耐用。……</p>
<p>忽然一陣喧鬧，從廟裏直透出來，其中聽得出一，二的是『打呀！……打呀！……』</p>
<p>「又打架了，這倒很好玩，年年如此」。正在賞玩景色的阿五笑嘻喀地說，的確有些幸災樂禍的意思。他說着，順手買了兩申荸薺，一串給了大根，作爲欣賞的寄託。大根接過荸薺，不說話，還在看着那些木器和竹器。但擁進廟裏去的人，却巳有不少。</p>
<p>喧鬧聲愈來愈大了，並且漸漸地由廟裏傳到廟外來了。有許多人先從廟裏擁出來，嘴裏也在喊着着「打！打死這些婊子養！的……」</p>
<p>一羣拉拉扯扯拳足交加的人，從廟門出來了。一出來，　邊的人，都　上去，顯然，他們不是去看熱鬧，是去參加的，於是打架的塲面，便在廟門外擴大了起來。</p>
<p>「哈哈，滇有趣，打得好」阿五在大聲笑着，「最好也奔上去送掉兩下，軋軋鬧熱」</p>
<p>塲面的逐漸擴大，竟將許多來不及奔避的荸薺　，基蔗擔　擔，……打翻了不少。喧嚷的人聲中，還夾着孩子們的哭聲。</p>
<p>一個十五六歲的孩子，在奔出來氣吼吼地喊着，「山北人先動手，山北人先動手！他們要報去年的仇，打山南人，山南人快快上去」！</p>
<p>大根一看，原來是弟虎根，便喊着說：「阿虎，阿虎，不要瞎闖」！</p>
<p>虎根看見了大根，就奔來說：「大哥知阿五哥快快上去，崇文鎭上的人已經破打壞好幾個了」。</p>
<p>「好極了」！阿五一聽見這話，立刻將胸前的鈕子扣上，衣袖一捲，鑽到人堆裏去。</p>
<p>「阿五哥！阿五哥！……」大根在喊着，意思想阻止他，但沒有用。</p>
<p>「大哥也去」！虎根在拉着大根的衣角。（二十九）</p>
<h3>二月份徵文錄取第五名　怎樣讀書，讀甚麼書？</h3>
<p>— 敬安</p>
<p>「行萬里路」，「讀萬卷書」，這種人，我相他的人生經騐一定很豐富，智識學問，一定很淵博。</p>
<p>然而量個人能夠經騐豐富，學問淵博；且在自己智識的進益，永無止境，在社會人羣方面，永遠佔着出類拔萃的地位，眞是談何容易？</p>
<p>古時的人，有許多因迫於家境貧困，無力進修，而「求知慾」又很旺盛時，往往「鑿壁偷光』，「囊螢映雪」，或是借人家的書籍來誦讀抄記等。這樣苦心的去追求學問，是值得我們效法的。但這不過是表面上的行爲，對於「怎樣讀書，讀甚麼書」？這個問題，我們還得要有深切的認識和了解。因爲讀書而沒有方法，又怎能達到「豐富」「淵博」的目的呢</p>
<p>在沒有討論到這個問題之前，我們首先要說明讀書的目的是甚麼？簡單的說，讀書的目的是在「達己達人」「利用厚生」。換句話說：讀書目的是在濟世，在爲社會人羣謀福利。然而，有許多人，在學校時期曾經下過一番廢寢忘食，勤學不倦的死工夫，這站在「名列至上」，「分數第一」的一般學生觀念的一班同學中看來，自然會有佔着優秀位置的資格</p>
<p>可是一踏入了五花八門的社會環境裏，遇事莫知所措，　架，不但從則所用功的「學非所用」；而且到處碰壁，還被人譏爲「百無一用是書生」，或對你嘲諷。那麼，在你個人心腑中的感覺，豈不是有點「前功盡棄」的痛苦嗎？</p>
<p>所以，我認爲像「書蠹「蛀書般夫孜孜力學的精神是很好的；但同時還須要注重實踐與　殿的工夫；方能達到「學以致用」的目的。因爲讀書目標旣在「達己達人」，「利用厚生」，而我們所生存的又是一個「日日新，又日新」的龐大複雜的社會裏，許多事物都不能使我們漠不關心的。因此我們一面要讀書，一面要體騐人生，這樣才可以使自己的智慧充實，而能獲得實際的應用。然則我們讀書的態度和方法究竟應該怎樣？鄙　以爲最重要的大概如下幾點：</p>
<p>（一）要有時代需要的認識。</p>
<p>（二）要有抉擇理解的眼光。</p>
<p>（三）要有剳記批註的毅力。</p>
<p>（四）要有研究討論的精神。</p>
<p>（五）要有體騐考察的閱歷。</p>
<p>讀書的態度旣如上述，然則應該讀甚麼書呢？關於這個問題，記得魯迅先生曾經有過這樣的說法，他說：研究社會科學的人，有機會不妨看看文學藝術，自然科學等其他的書籍；同樣的，研究專門技術的人，有機會也應該看看哲學，文學，心理學，史地，法律等形式上似乎與自己一門無關由要的書籍。這樣，一方面可以調劑你讀書的興趣，一方面可以拿別種學問的優點，來補充自己所學的不足。因爲世界事物旣日新月異，所以我們要從多方面去求知以適應環境需要，這是現時代讀書修身必須有的態度。</p>

<h3>憶兒童節</h3>
<p>可是爹怎麼會這麼狠心？小紅每次看見門口那塊空地上有個小蘆席捲，總要吐上十幾口吐沫。但是，現在，她的弟弟也……</p>
<p>想呀想的，小紅到了公園門口。</p>
<p>這回人更多了，電袁鷹車一部剖裝滿了人開　來，到這里全吐下了；馬路上也全是成羣的學生們，穿淸新衣裳，小皮鞋咭刮咭刋的嚮，有的是大人攙着，一隻手提着一大包糖呀糕呀什麼東西，誰都沒來買小紅的花生和豆。</p>
<p>她提着籃子，跟在兩個剛從三輪車上下來的大人和一個穿洋裝的孩子後面，身不由主地擠進去。</p>
<p>「滾開！小癟三！」鐵欄杆旁嚮起了雷似的聲音。</p>
<p>她嚇了一大跳，幾乎連藍子都翻掉了，她看看那個巡捕的臉，倒抽了一口氣。</p>
<p>「死東西！」——肚子里駡着。</p>
<p>可是那兩個大人和穿洋裝的孩子終於擠進去了，別人也一個一個擠進去了，一大隊一大隊的小學生們也擠進去了，擠不進去的就只有她小紅。</p>
<p>還是回是才的籬笆旁，籃子放面前石頭上。</p>
<p>籬笆里面的草地上，孩子們還在那兒，而且玩着呢！二三十個人坐了一個大圈子，一個穿綠西裝的男孩子在圈子外面中我，一面丟了一條手帕在一個粉紅衣裳的女孩子後面，那女孩子立刻發覺了，拿起手帕在後面追，可是子跑得快，跑了一圈，搶着女孩子的空立子坐了下來。…………</p>
<p>「哈……」二三十個人連兩個女先生都拍着手歡呼起來。</p>
<p>在旁邊着的幾個大人和八九個孩子也笑了。</p>
<p>小紅也忘了自己地笑起來。</p>
<p>可是笑聲忽然變了根弟的急促的聲音：「小紅！……小紅！……不得了！……快回去！金弟被警察踢傷了！……頭摜破…………」</p>
<p>「怎幹的？」小紅提起籃子就跑。</p>
<p>屋子里黑壓壓的全是人，金弟閉起眼睡在媽的懷里，頭上臉上全是鮮紅的血。</p>
<p>「舀點冷水來！」爹的粗暴的聲音。</p>
<p>小紅立刻拿了破面盆，跳到馬路，到對面鐵路旁　池塘去。</p>
<p>舀了水，她抬起頭來，喘了一口氣。</p>
<p>天上飄動着五六隻紙　大概是公園里的孩子們放吧！</p>

<h3>Outlook on the Global War Situation</h3>
<p>The current focus of the global war situation can generally be said to be the battle in Tunis, North Africa. The enemy, with the British Eighth Army, the American Fifth Army, and the French forces who defected from the Pétain-Laval government, launched a "large-scale offensive" which has been ongoing for three weeks. In terms of the number of soldiers and the equipment, the enemy has an absolute advantage; and it is said that in a few days, the British First Army will also join this war. On the contrary, the Axis forces, under the command of General Rommel and General Arnim, are undoubtedly inferior in strength. However, for several weeks, due to excellent strategy, strong defense lines, and the convenience of communication and supply from places like Sicily, they have been able to persist in counterattacking the British, American, and rebel French forces, step by step preventing their advance. Except for the planned shortening of the defense line in southern Tunisia, the most important positions and areas have remained steadfast. This arduous and outstanding defensive war, in which a small number of troops resists a three-sided siege, can be said to have the same important significance as the Eastern Front's defense of Stalingrad. Due to the German and Italian forces holding fast in Tunis, they have at least achieved the following important gains: First, absorbing a large number of troops that the British and Americans are preparing to counterattack, hindering the realization of their dreamed-of "second front"; second, buying more time to complete and strengthen the defense lines of Italy and the northern coast of the Mediterranean, and the preparations for anti-landing operations on the northwest coast of France and the countries of the North Sea; third, tying down the largest enemy force with the smallest number of troops, so that the German and Italian Allied forces can fight on the Eastern Front without any worries about the West; fourth, maintaining the initiative in the world war, so that they can calmly prepare for the launch of the summer offensive. In one corner of Tunis, the German and Italian forces have diligently completed these four major tasks and are now approaching the decisive battle stage. The guarantee of ultimate victory lies in maintaining the shortest transport line in the Mediterranean—the transport line between Sicily and Bizerte—and in controlling the air. Up to now, we absolutely trust in the superiority of the German and Italian forces in these two aspects.</p>
<p>Due to the unexpectedly slow progress of the enemy's so-called major offensive in Tunis, North Africa, the war on the Eastern Front of Europe has been directly affected in a way that favors the Axis powers. The German and Italian side can gain time to calmly gather reinforcements from Europe, reorganize the front lines, launch an offensive, and regain the initiative temporarily lost in winter. In the Kuban and Donets regions, the battles of the past few weeks have completely changed the face of the German-Soviet war situation since the new year, and even the Soviet Information Bureau had to admit to a "temporary lull" on the German-Soviet front. However, in any case, this front remains the main theater of war in Europe. Before the war in Tunis is concluded, the German and Italian forces have ample time to deploy the initiative and offensive in this theater. The future situation depends on (1) how the Soviet Union handles the situation caused by the winter offensive, how it reorganizes its forces, and the extent and strength of new troop replenishment; (2) to what extent Germany and Italy achieve in concentrating troops and mastering the initiative in air operations; and (3) what is the actual significance of the "second front" that the British and Americans are again clamoring about. From the current actual situation, Germany and Italy maintain an absolute advantage in the second point, and the third point is still just thunder without rain so far. As for the first point, we naturally cannot draw a definite conclusion from scattered telegrams and news, but judging from the fact that the British military delegation has gone to the Soviet Union these days, and that the Soviet Union has agreed to the international economic conference initiated by the United States, it seems that even the Soviet Union itself still lacks sufficient confidence.</p>
<p>Of course, we must not ignore the other aspect of the world war, the Greater East Asia battlefield. However, perhaps everyone can see the situation on this battlefield clearly: the armies of our friendly nation, Japan, have always maintained the initiative and a certain advantage of victory. We can see positive news in the newspapers every day, so there is no need to repeat it here. Let's look at the opposite side of the story. In the Americas, the new Australian Foreign Minister Evatt arrived a few days ago. He is preparing to go to Washington via Argentina to discuss Pacific issues with the US authorities. On the way, he repeatedly made speeches criticizing the policies of Roosevelt and Churchill, fully expressing Australia's concern about the increasingly close Japanese threat. Similarly, the so-called military delegation from Chongqing staying in Britain is also complaining everywhere, just like Soong Tzu-wen and Soong Mei-ling's activities in the United States. All they have received is so-called popular "warm welcomes," while the rescue they are anxiously seeking to save them from danger has been unexpectedly met with indifference. As for the India issue, due to the British authorities' persistent obstinacy and brutal suppression of the Indian people's demands for independence, the situation is becoming increasingly serious. All these new developments in Australia, Chongqing, and India show the bright future of the Axis powers in East Asia. The friendly relations between Japan, China, Manchukuo, and the countries of the South are also developing in an unprecedentedly optimistic atmosphere. The daily victories of the Japanese navy and air force in the Southwest Pacific and the new victories on the India-Burma border will be the prelude to the victory of the Axis powers in the 1943 world war.</p>
<h3>Meeting of Two Major German and Italian Leaders to Discuss Joint Operation Plans and Resolve to Exert All Efforts to Strive for Final Victory</h3>
<p>Berlin, November 11 (Central News Agency Telegram) The government announced tonight that Führer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini had met for four days from April 7th to 10th at the Führer's headquarters. This was the seventh meeting of the leaders of the two major Axis powers in Europe since the beginning of the European War. The communique stated that the two sides had discussed in detail the general political situation and all issues related to joint strategy, and had reached complete agreement on the measures to be taken in all aspects. Those who participated in the meeting with the Prime Minister included Italian Army Chief of Staff General Ambrosio, Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Bastianini, and officials from the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Supreme Command. Hitler's entourage included Marshal Göring, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, German Army Commander Keitel, Navy Commander Dönitz, Army Chief of Staff Zeitzler, as well as German Ambassador to Italy Mackensen and Italian Ambassador to Germany Alfieri. "Regarding the communiqué, the two leaders discussed the general political situation and all issues related to joint strategy, and reached complete agreement on the measures to be taken in all aspects. The German Führer and the Italian also reiterated their determination and the determination of the two peoples to mobilize all their forces to fight until final victory, completely eliminating the future dangers threatening Europe and Africa, whether this danger comes from the West or the East. They also reaffirmed the common goal of the Axis powers to defend European culture and guarantee the free development and mutual cooperation of all countries. The victory of the Tripartite Pact countries will ensure peace in Europe, and all nations will cooperate based on their common interests and the fair distribution of world economic resources. The negotiations between the German Führer and the Italian Prime Minister were conducted in the most sincere spirit," it said.</p>
<p>Berlin, November 12 (Central News Agency Telegram) This meeting between the German and Italian leaders was the seventh major meeting since the outbreak of the war. Regarding this meeting, knowledgeable sources expressed their views as follows: This meeting was a review of the overall political situation and joint strategies on the Axis side, and complete consensus was reached on opinions such as striving to complete the war and upholding European civilization. This meeting has decided to fully mobilize the economic power of the Axis powers, and opinions have also been exchanged on the future organization of Europe. In short, the ultimate goal of the Axis forces is to ensure the fair distribution and abundance of the world's resources and to make the standard of living in Europe safer. The anti-Axis camp has repeatedly discussed post-war strategies recently, but their discussions are only to prevent the free development of small countries and nations in order to cater to the Soviet Union. The Axis powers are now presenting a completely new plan for solving various difficulties in world politics and economy, as well as domestic and social issues in various countries. The purpose of the social and international issues discussed this time can be said to be the construction of pan-Europeanism.</p>
<p>Berlin, November 12 (Central News Agency Telegram) The dramatic meeting between the two major German and Italian leaders began last week at the German Führer's headquarters and lasted for four days.

This conversation began immediately after Mr. Mussolini and his party had unpacked their luggage. In this initial meeting, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Bastianini lasted half a day, and the entire Italian delegation attended a banquet hosted by Ribbentrop in the evening.

Those present on the German side were General Göring, General Keitel, Admiral Dönitz, Air Force Chief of Staff Major General Bodenschatz, General Zeitzler, etc. The political meetings were all presided over by Ribbentrop and Bastianini, and German Ambassador to Italy Mackensen and Italian Ambassador to Germany Alfieri also participated in the meeting.

<h3>Macau Correspondence: Qinghai in the Northwest – Rich in Mineral and Forest Resources, An Unexplored Virgin Land</h3>
<p>— Jin Yan</p>
<p>"Gold is everywhere in Qinghai." After traveling through some parts of this province, we are even more convinced that the words of our predecessors are not false. However, this is a "virgin land" that has not been developed throughout the country, and it should not remain barren for long.</p>
<p>In terms of its location, Qinghai relies on Xinjiang to the west, is bordered by Mongolia and Tibet on the left and right, connects to Gansu in the northeast, and borders Xikang in the southeast. It is located in the center of the country, surrounded by high mountains and steep ridges. In terms of resources, it is rich in minerals, forests, fisheries, animal husbandry, and water resources. Therefore, it can be said to be an ideal area for future industrial development.</p>
<p>When the reporter arrived in Qinghai, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to go to Dulan to see the Chaka Salt Lake. After crossing Riyue Mountain from Xining, we traveled along the southern shore of Qinghai Lake across a vast grassland. The journey took one and a half days, and we spent one night in a tent in the severe cold of fourteen degrees below zero, eating cold mutton and drinking water boiled with cow dung as fuel. However, it did not diminish our courage to see the salt lake. On the grassland, the car sped like lightning, startling herds of wild horses and rapidly running Tibetan gazelles. In the twilight of the setting sun, we finally saw the jade-like, crystal-clear, and infinitely silver Chaka Salt Lake.</p>
<p>The salt lake is 75 li wide from east to west, 35 li long from north to south, and 175 li in circumference. This vast salt lake is filled with a thick layer of crystals. Although the reserves are so abundant, only 50,000 dan were extracted last year. This is not because the salt extraction method requires any technological improvements. We saw the salt workers using iron spoons to probe the water, placing it on the lake surface and rinsing it once more, and that was the white, high-quality salt. Because this salt belongs to a cold crystal, its composition is higher than that of sea salt.</p>
<p>It is difficult to have an accurate estimate of the reserves of the salt lake. In the past, some people calculated the amount stored in each cubic meter, then multiplied it by its area, and the resulting amount was 300 million tons. Based on the pre-war national salt consumption of 1.5 million tons per year, it would be enough to supply the country for 200 years. However, the depth of the salt lake is more than three zhang in the center. The current mining ports are on the periphery, with a depth of only one zhang and five chi, and the crystal layer is only one chi wide. Below that is all water, and the salt content in this water accounts for 25%, which is not included in the calculation. Moreover, since it was formed by the drying up of the sea, the reserves in the surrounding strata are also considerable. After rain, the runoff flows into the lake and recrystallizes, forming a salt layer again. Therefore, the estimated quantity is quite different from the actual amount of salt contained.</p>
<p>What is even more unexplored is whether there is rock salt in the lake. If there is, then it will truly become an inexhaustible treasure. Otherwise, if our industry develops in the future, like the United States, where each person uses an average of 48 pounds of salt per year, it will still be a limited resource.</p>
<p>However, as far as the present situation is concerned, we can still use this salt lake to make Qinghai the center of industry, because salt is indispensable for industry, and salt is the mother of all chemical industries.</p>
<p>The cost of salt is lower than other places because of its large supply. The Chaka Salt Lake belongs to the Mongolian banner, the jurisdiction of the King of Qinghai. The salt workers are all Mongolian people, and the central government gives the King of Qinghai a sum of money every year. The Mongolian people are paid one yuan for every shi of salt they extract. The several Mongolian yurts near the salt lake rely on animal husbandry and salt extraction for their livelihood.</p>
<p>The current output is not high due to transportation difficulties. This year, due to the prevalence of cattle plague, too many yaks have died. The number of Tibetan people responsible for transporting salt is decreasing day by day, and it is even more difficult for the output to exceed last year's. The salt is supplied to places within the province and even transported to the borders of Sichuan and Xikang and Gansu Province. There are five distribution centers: Niezhu, Xining, Datong, Lusha'er, and Shangwuzhuang. The transportation cost per dan from the salt lake to the above-mentioned distribution centers is sixty-two yuan to Xining and seventy-two yuan. What the reporter saw at the salt lake, apart from the salt workers, were herds of camels and cattle transporting salt.</p>
<p>On the way from Xining to Chaka Salt Lake, the reporter passed through the Haiyan grassland area. The obstacles encountered along the way were nothing more than cattle and sheep bones, especially the number of lying cattle was even greater. This certainly shows the severity of this year's cattle plague, but it is a pity that these bones are discarded on the ground. Bones are an excellent raw material for making fertilizer, and a greater use is for making phosphorus, which is also a necessity for industry. Like other resources in Qinghai, it is left there unused. In fact, within Qinghai, we can have unlimited hope from livestock alone. There are too many leather products, and I am afraid that everyone is only shocked by the name of black-purple lambskin, which is only used for luxury goods. We do not have statistics on production, but in the past, there were also several thousand pieces exported each year. Before July of this year, it was a period of control, and it was not possible to transport and sell freely out of the province, which made the leather goods stores in Xining City have sluggish business. Now that it is open, a tax of 280 yuan per piece can be freely transported out.</p>
<p>There are very few leather products seen within Qinghai Province. Here we can know that, in terms of resource use, it seems that we have not yet entered the door of industry. Apart from seeing the military uniform factory having a leather tanning section, other leather processing factories are not yet mentioned.</p>
<p>As far as the current situation is concerned, wool still occupies the first place in the assets received from livestock.</p>
<p>We do not have an accurate statistic of how much wool Qinghai produces each year. Roughly speaking, there are always forty to fifty thousand dan. The provincial authorities told reporters that the wool quality is still good, and in the future, we should not improve the breed of sheep, but focus on how to breed sheep. In fact, seriously speaking, Qinghai wool was popular in the international market in the past because the wool fiber is hard and has a luster, which is suitable for weaving carpets. If it is used to manufacture woolen fabrics, the color will be worse. It is also necessary to improve the breed of sheep for domestic sales. A recent example is that the merino sheep in Xinjiang are said to produce as much as ten catties of wool per year, while Gansu and Ningxia only produce three catties. If the wool quality is not much different, it seems necessary to transplant and breed the sheep from Xinjiang.</p>
<p>Speaking of cattle, Qinghai is famous for its yaks (i.e., Bos grunniens), followed by yellow cattle and yak-cattle hybrids. Yaks come from Tibet, and yak-cattle hybrids are formed by mating yellow cattle and yaks. Most of the farming and transportation rely on yaks. This year, the yak plague is very severe, and it is said that more than 1.2 million heads have died. Regarding the arrival of the cattle plague, some people say it comes from the Dulan area. In fact, Dulan is relatively good. The most serious is still Yijiao City. When the reporter passed through Huangyuan County, more than 17,000 yaks had died in the city.</p>
<p>Qinghai's famous horses and camels do not have definite numbers. It is only known that the horses ridden by the cavalry charging at the front are mostly produced in Qinghai.</p>
<p>In terms of minerals, it is difficult for any province in the Northwest to compare with Qinghai. As far as we know, China's gold mines are headed by Heilongjiang. In fact, Qinghai's gold mines have rarely been paid attention to in the past. Despite shouting "exchange gold with legal tender," describing artificial labor as expensive and gold panning as not worth the loss, there are still a large number of workers working every day. Regarding the quantity, the reporter did not inquire and should not speculate.</p>
<p>Qinghai's mineral distribution area is concentrated in Dulan, Tong-Northwest to Dunhuang, and Southwest to the Qaidam Basin. This includes gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, sulfur, borax, and other types, which are too numerous to mention. In addition, the reserves of alkali and petroleum are also thick. It's just that these treasures have not only not been developed, but even the initial investigation has not been done in the past. Only the coal seams of the Qilian Mountains and the east of Riyue Mountain are mined by indigenous methods, and the quantity is also considerable.</p>
<p>But no matter how much the amount of coal is, the future industrial development of Qinghai can completely rely on electrification. The Xiangtang Gorge, Laoya Gorge, and Zhama in the middle that the reporter passed through on the way from Lanzhou to Dulan have rapid water flow and strong water power. According to experts, the three places have more than enough power to generate hundreds of thousands of horsepower, which can not only create the electrification of Qinghai in the future, but also supply neighboring provinces. Now, the water mills on both sides of the Huangshui River are connected one after another, and the agricultural society still knows how to use power.</p>
<p>The inability to develop resources is hindered by the difficulty of transportation. If Qinghai is really electrified, the best means of transportation is still the tram. Speaking of transportation, Qinghai Lake is not necessarily unable to navigate, and it is also the best seaplane field. Qinghai's vast and boundless grasslands can park countless airplanes.</p>
<p>The reporter only stayed in Qinghai for twelve days in a short period of time, and already felt that the countless resources that could not be explained or described should not be wasted. Qinghai's door needs the assistance of the industrial community in all aspects to come and develop. (Sent on March 10, 1943)</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles in Central Tunisia: German-Italian Allied Forces Shorten Their Lines, Withdraw from Sfax and Kairouan</h3>
<p>Rome, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Italian Army Headquarters announced today that the German-Italian Allied Forces intend to adopt new positions in Tunisia and have withdrawn from Sfax and Kairouan. The enemy, covered by tanks, launched a fierce attack on the southern part of the front line, but was repelled. At the same time, the Axis air force destroyed many anti-Axis communication lines, and German fighters also shot down five enemy Spitfires.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Axis forces in Tunisia are now shortening their positions to a strong defense line 400 kilometers long, from Sfax in the north through Kairouan in the west to Cape Serrat, 60 kilometers west of Bizerte. The line has a depth of 50 kilometers and is strong enough to stop the advance of the anti-Axis forces. The fiercest fighting occurred on the central front on the 10th, when the British Eighth Army, advancing north from Sfax, coordinated with the French rebel forces and launched an attack on Kairouan in the west of Kairouan. The battle was extremely fierce all day long, but was repelled by the Axis forces, and 60 tanks were destroyed. According to a report from the United Press, the anti-Axis forces in the Sfax area advanced to La Hencha, 27 kilometers north of the city, on the 10th, but this has not yet been confirmed. In addition, on the northern front, the two armies continue to engage in fierce fighting in the areas of Medjez el Bab and Mateur.</p>
<p>Bern, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Rommel's troops continued to retreat north to new positions yesterday. The powerful Axis forces fought bravely and inflicted heavy losses on the anti-Axis forces in the Pichon area of southern Tunisia. The total number of casualties suffered by the anti-Axis forces while attempting to break through the Axis line in the Magel Bel Abbès valley is currently unknown, but Reuters, citing military sources, said that on the first night of the battle, there were twelve remains of anti-Axis tanks in the valley. After the U.S. forces under General Patton and the British Eighth Army under General Montgomery met, they jointly launched an offensive in the area. The main objective of the anti-Axis attack was to reach the east coast of Tunisia, hoping to isolate the tank force under Wermel stationed further south, preventing it from retreating north and joining forces with the troops under General Arnim. The offensive route taken by the anti-Axis forces was through the Magel Bel Abbès valley, which is a thoroughfare running east-west, with mountains on both the north and south sides, defended by Axis artillery. Before the anti-Axis forces attacked, they bombarded the area with artillery fire in an attempt to shake the Axis artillery positions and bypass the mountains held by the Axis forces, hoping to attack the Axis artillery from the rear. Although the British and American forces far outnumbered the Axis forces, they ultimately failed to break through the German defenses. It is said that elite British troops, French rebel troops, and powerful tank forces assisted the American forces in the attack. According to a Berlin announcement, a U.S. tank force was completely annihilated by the Axis artillery. The attack of the anti-Axis forces was defeated, and they hoped to avoid the battle and reorganize their troops. The Axis air force then attacked, causing great chaos among the anti-Axis forces. At the same time, the main force of the Axis forces continued to retreat north in an orderly manner. Reuters' military correspondent stated today that he believes that Marshal Rommel will not attempt any resistance in Sousse, but will continue to retreat north to the mountainous area of Enfidaville, and after joining forces with the troops under General Arnim, will establish a position along a line from Enfidaville to somewhere west of Bizerte on the northwest coast. The strong positions of the German-Italian forces in this hilly area will be able to offer extremely fierce resistance.</p>
<h3>British Commander-in-Chief in the Near East, Wilson, Visits Ankara; The Soviet Union Expresses Concern</h3>
<p>Ankara, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to sources close to the British Embassy here, General Wilson, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Near East, along with a large number of staff, is expected to arrive here tomorrow to discuss everything with Turkish officials. President İsmet İnönü and Prime Minister Şükrü Saracoğlu will return to Ankara tomorrow.</p>
<p>Ankara, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to Reuters, the Soviet Union here is quite surprised by the upcoming visit of General Wilson, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Middle East, to Ankara for consultations. Soviet Ambassador Vinogradov has not received sufficient information on the future British-Turkish negotiations, and the Soviet Embassy is apparently trying to seek information about General Wilson's visit from other diplomatic representatives in Ankara.</p>
<p>Resumption of Diplomatic Relations Between the Soviet Union and Egypt Seems Unlikely</p>
<p>Ankara, 11th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to Reuters, the new Egyptian Minister to Turkey, Abdurrahim, stated in a conversation with the Iranian Ambassador to Turkey a few days ago that it seems unlikely that Egypt and the Soviet Union will resume diplomatic negotiations. The Egyptian minister pointed out that conservative elements in Egypt, especially the court and orthodox Islamic circles, are strongly opposed to the resumption of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Eastern Front Remains Quiet, with Only Reconnaissance Activities</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 12th (Central News Agency) – The Eastern Front remained quiet yesterday. In recent days, there seems to be no immediate large-scale operation. Reuters' correspondent in Moscow, Mr. King, reported that there is very little news from the domestic front, so Soviet people have paid more attention to the Tunisian campaign. Along the two-thousand-mile Soviet front, there are only reconnaissance and reconnaissance activities to break the silence. At present, the areas of operation are the Kupyansk bridgehead in the south, the Donets River area in the middle to the upper reaches of the river, and the area south of Lake Ilmen, but there are no fierce battles in these three areas.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) – On the Eastern Front, due to warm weather and snow melt, the roads are muddy, and ground operations are extremely difficult. There have only been small-scale local battles in the past two or three weeks, while the German Air Force has been unusually active. The German military authorities issued the following war report on the 10th: The Soviet forces in the Novorossiysk and southern Kupyansk River areas are isolated due to the German attack. At present, the Soviet forces seem to be trying to strengthen their forces and launch a counterattack to reverse the decline. In the middle reaches of the Donets River, the German army surrounded several Soviet units and completely annihilated them, thwarting the enemy's resistance on the west bank of the river. The German Air Force is still active. German bomber squadrons have raided Soviet airfields on both sides of Lake Ladoga, and other squadrons have attacked dense enemy forces in the southern area of Lake Ilmen. The enemy suffered heavy losses in soldiers and military supplies. The German Air Force also attacked important transportation hubs on the Murmansk Railway, destroying several freight cars, and simultaneously launched a fierce attack on important military facilities behind the Soviet lines.</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Bombers Bomb Three Cities</h3>
<p>Rome, 12th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Italian General Headquarters announced today that several squadrons of anti-Axis four-engine bombers attacked Naples, Trapani, and Marsala yesterday. The residential areas suffered the most damage.</p>
<h3>Japanese Local Governors' Conference Held; Prime Minister Tojo Delivers Keynote Address: Officials and People Cooperate to Complete the War</h3>

<h3>An Analysis of Eden's Mission to the U.S.: Nakedly Revealing the Evil Intentions Harbored by Britain</h3>
<p>(Special Telegram from Stockholm, 29th) British Foreign Secretary Eden's activities in the U.S. over the past two weeks have been obscured by various propaganda maneuvers, making it difficult to grasp the truth. However, based on comprehensive information arriving here from various sources, it is an undeniable fact that his mission was to prevent rifts in the relationship between the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union. Moreover, it is also clear that the outcome of the discussions regarding countermeasures for this issue did not achieve any success. Harold Callender reported in the New York Times on the 28th: "According to leaks from U.S. government circles, the talks did not go beyond the realm of exploration and did not reach a final conclusion." This report can serve as proof of the aforementioned fact. But what agreements did Eden actually make with the U.S. authorities? What discussions did he have? - To understand this, one only needs to conduct a correct study of the existing fundamental conflicts and cooperative relationships between the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union, and the truth of the situation will naturally emerge. The following is an attempt to examine the situation by integrating information from various sources:</p>
<p>Eden's main task was to adjust the relations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, especially to alleviate the U.S.-Soviet opposition centered on the issue of post-war management, which is an undeniable fact. That is, the Soviet Union's post-war plan advocated for the restoration of the three Baltic states, the eastern half of Poland, and the old territory of Bessarabia; in response, the United States, based on the principle of national self-determination contained in the Atlantic Charter, took a resolute stance of rejection, thus causing disputes. Britain, situated in the middle, had already made its attitude clear in Churchill's previous broadcast and the editorial of The Times of London, which was to sacrifice the small countries of Europe and recognize the Soviet Union's claims. To mediate the conflict between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, Eden made this visit to the U.S. However, the fact that Britain would readily agree to the Soviet Union's demands conceals the cunning of Britain's traditional, shrewd diplomacy, which cannot be overlooked. That cunning is:</p>
<p>(1) The current issue is to alleviate the Soviet Union's dissatisfaction with the still undeveloped second front.</p>
<p>(2) In the future, regarding the threat of the rise of a Fourth German Reich, the Soviet Union will be tasked with containing it from behind. (Britain's balance of power policy in Europe before the war was to make Germany and France confront and fight against each other. Now, with the collapse of France as a turning point, it has changed into a new policy of balance of power based solely on the opposition between Germany and the Soviet Union.)</p>
<p>(3) Furthermore, regarding the threat of the Soviet Union's communization of the world, it wants to take the lead with diplomatic concessions in advance, in order to restrain the Soviet Union's activities to a certain limit.</p>
<p>(4) On the other hand, for the necessity of maintaining its empire, Britain is extremely afraid of the U.S. dominating the world, especially its extension into Europe. Therefore, it wants to shake hands with the Soviet Union to prevent the U.S. from dominating Europe. (This is completely the same strategy as the U.S. supporting Darlan and Giraud in French North Africa, while Britain and the Soviet Union are setting up a common front to support de Gaulle.)</p>
<p>In short, Britain's post-war plan undoubtedly envisions cooperating with the Soviet Union to divide the European continent, and then to restrain the unlimited expansion of Soviet power, while at the same time preventing the U.S. from entering Europe as much as possible. Some reports say that Britain has also indicated to the U.S. that it is willing to entrust the western half of the Atlantic and the entire Pacific waters to the U.S.'s sphere of influence, so that in the future, when the Soviet Union leaps too far, the Christian countries of Britain and the U.S. can unite and confront the Soviet Union from both ends of the ocean. In that case, it can be said that Churchill is trying to learn from Zhuge Liang, planning to divide the world into three parts with Britain, the U.S., and the Soviet Union, in order to harmonize the three countries. However, the U.S. believes that Britain's intention is in fact a betrayal of the Atlantic Charter and holds a resentful attitude. Former U.S. Ambassador to Paris William Bullitt gave a speech in New York saying:</p>
<p>"If any of the anti-Axis countries tramples on the Atlantic Charter, the U.S. will return to its isolationism again with disappointment and resentment."</p>
<p>This speech can also be seen as revealing Roosevelt's feelings towards the Soviet Union and Britain.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, Eden's main task in visiting the U.S. was also the issue of the second front. Britain takes the position of hoping to realize the second battlefield as soon as possible due to the following reasons:</p>
<p>(1) Fear of Germany attacking the British mainland</p>
<p>(2) Fear of being strangled by submarines;</p>
<p>(3) Hope to get rid of the suffering of war sooner</p>
<p>(4) There is an urgent need to sweep away dissatisfaction in the Soviet Union and at home.</p>
<p>However, needless to say, it is impossible to realize the second front by Britain alone. Therefore, in order to have something to say to the Soviet Union, it has to explore the U.S.'s intentions regarding the early deployment of the second front. However, the U.S.'s position on the second front issue is very different from Britain's; Britain takes the war against Germany as its first principle, but the U.S. is in fact in a position where it must concentrate all its efforts on the war against Japan. Therefore, it eagerly requests a guarantee that Britain and the Soviet Union will actively participate in the Asian war after the war against Germany is over. Therefore, the more realistic reason for the current US-Soviet opposition can be seen as the mutual strategy regarding this second front issue, which contains the meaning of a price. During the previous Casablanca conference, Roosevelt's biggest goal was to lure Stalin to participate in the Asian issue as the price for deploying the second front in Europe, but the result was a complete failure. The U.S.'s dissatisfaction with the Soviet Union was clearly exposed in the daydream about the post-war plan, and it always wanted to drag the Soviet Union into the whirlpool of Asia whenever it had the opportunity; however, the Soviet Union still has not regarded this matter as an important real issue with a firm attitude; and Britain, from its utilitarian position of wanting Germany and the Soviet Union to fight each other comprehensively, does not express any joy about this matter. Now, the Soviet Union is complaining that it is solely bearing the pressure of the German army, and the U.S. is using its sole bearing of the strong pressure from Japan in the Pacific as an excuse to thoroughly use the European second front as the price for the Asian issue.

<h3>Dusty and Weary: Soong Mei-ling Receives Ridicule in the U.S.</h3>
<p>(Dispatch from the Argentinian Capital, Guttet, 2nd) Since the departure of Xiong Shihui of the Chongqing military delegation from Washington, due to the U.S.'s lack of sincerity in assisting Chongqing, a "blank" state, the first since 1938, has emerged between the U.S. and Chongqing. Soong Mei-ling, who arrived in Washington with great fanfare on February 14th of this year, her mission was to break this blank state. As soon as she arrived there, she met with reporters, gave speeches in Congress, attended lectures, and flew back and forth between Washington, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and other places, using her American-style English that she was good at. She was busy without warming her seat, shouting hoarsely to the U.S. government and the public, "Promote and strengthen aid to Chongqing, the Pacific War first,". Recently, even Wellington Koo followed suit and came to work on the sidelines with T.V. Soong, Wei Tao-ming, and others to support her. But what kind of reaction has the U.S. had to her enthusiastic activities? Here, we will try to collect reports from the U.S. to provide an indirect report on Soong Mei-ling's activities in the U.S.</p>
<p>Soong Mei-ling Being Played With</p>
<p>Among all the movements in the U.S. government and the public centered on her, the first thing that makes people feel is the question of whether she is truly receiving heartfelt and sincere hospitality in the U.S. The speeches day and night and the continuous evening parties finally caused her to faint once. American newspapers and magazines did not seriously mention her biggest purpose in visiting the U.S., "Promoting and strengthening aid to Chongqing, Pacific War first," but only talked about how good her speeches were, how moving her demeanor was, how beautiful her clothes were, etc., using the tone of promoting red dancers and famous opera singers, fooling around randomly, and deliberately avoiding the truth of her political intentions. In short, this beautiful "Empress Dowager of Chongqing" is ultimately nothing more than being played with in their palms! For example, when she spoke in front of more than 20,000 audience members in Madison Square Park in New York on March 1st, Time magazine carried a report of more than two pages, all of which described the scene of the meeting and the unparalleled beauty of this VIP:</p>
<p>"Behind Soong Mei-ling was a gray-green curtain with two red Chinese characters 'Victory' written on it. She was wearing a black, long-style evening dress, wearing green earrings, and wearing black gloves. Her outfit that night was exactly the latest fashionable style in the world created by Hollywood superstars a few months ago. American reporters had used more than 20 adjectives such as charming, gentle, and stunning before the proper noun 'Soong Mei-ling': but that night, she could also be added with more than 30 such adjectives."</p>
<p>However, the introduction of the content of the speech and the words about helping Chongqing were not mentioned at all. Also, on February 28th, when she stepped onto the podium of the U.S. Congress as the second foreign woman (the first was Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands) amid the melodious music, the New York and Washington newspapers, like Time magazine, all wrote it as an interesting article. Let's give an example.</p>
<p>"In the Senate chamber, Soong Mei-ling arrived wearing a black satin Chinese dress. After Vice President Wallace, with his sharp, curious, and admiring eyes, made his introductory remarks, she smiled gracefully and quietly spoke into the microphone, giving a very moving speech that lasted more than an hour. The most unforgettable part was about a pilot under General Doolittle. When that pilot jumped out of a parachute in the sky over Chongqing, he waved to the arriving foreigners and shouted the only Chinese words he knew, 'America, America.' We can clearly see a vivid image of the friendship between the U.S. and Chongqing."</p>
<p>As above, it is just a low-key example.</p>
<p>Soong Mei-ling's Anger</p>
<p>Not only newspapers, but in any aspect, they always dealt with her in such a tone. She finally became angry at this kind of low-key flattery. When she continued to speak in the House of Representatives, she used a rather resentful and sarcastic tone of sarcasm, and completely abandoned the diplomatic rhetoric used in the Senate. She quoted a letter written in 1928 by a classmate from her alma mater, Wellesley College in Massachusetts, saying:</p>
<p>"Although I am thinking of going to the United States, I would hate to be seen as asking the United States to send troops." After saying something angry about her mission to the United States, she continued:</p>
<p>"The American people have the right to boast about the American soldiers who are engaged in combat all over the world. But it cannot be forgotten that the current American soldiers are stationed in remote places, where they live a monotonous life day after day with other anti-Axis soldiers, waiting for the opportunity."</p>
<p>She further made a sharp satire of the inactivity of the American Air Force in China and the defensive position of the Pacific front, indirectly questioning the U.S.'s lack of sincerity in aiding Chongqing. Then, the father quoted a Chinese proverb, "It's easy to watch others carry the burden," and described Chongqing's painful position of fighting against Japan alone, and made a fairly direct question of the Anglo-American bystander attitude. Finally, she said:</p>
<p>"What Chongqing needs most now is airplanes. As long as there is a supply of airplanes, Chongqing will definitely become the most powerful wing of the anti-Axis camp and will definitely fight for you to see."</p>
<p>Although she said such harsh words, the reports in the newspapers at that time did not take it seriously at all, with the only exception being the Washington Post, which said, "Soong Mei-ling's speech ultimately caused the entire House of Representatives chamber to suddenly reveal an embarrassed look."</p>
<p>Selfish Sacrifice</p>
<p>In short, Soong Mei-ling's visit to the United States was charged with the extremely profound mission of opening up a path for Chongqing, which was standing at a critical juncture of life and death. How could she have been surrounded by such a superficial, sensational, and taste-oriented atmosphere? Is this due to her own so-called confusing personality, or is it the cunning policy implemented by the Roosevelt faction? Although it is difficult to judge, it is never completely independent of these two elements.</p>
<p>During her meeting with the press corps at the White House last time, Soong Mei-ling made full use of diplomatic rhetoric in front of hundreds of journalists: According to the American newspapers at the time, Roosevelt, who was sitting at the same table, used an attitude like "an uncle comforting his nephew" to take on the task of introducing Soong Mei-ling to the press corps. At that time, Soong Mei-ling said to the journalists in a tactful manner: "The President is most concerned about the urgent matter of aiding Chongqing. I am at ease with everything and rely solely on the President." Although she used such clever expressions to urge aid to Chongqing; however, Roosevelt said: "Everything is up to God's will," and lightly brushed off Soong Mei-ling's sharp edge.</p>
<p>That being said, the truth is that the traditional policy of the United States depends on its own interests. Roosevelt's decision to increase his air force in China in order to bomb the Japanese mainland was an established fact, not for the sake of "aiding Chongqing," and had nothing to do with Soong Mei-ling's activities.

<h3>German Aircraft Attack the U.S.: Extremely High Probability</h3>
<p>According to dispatches from Washington, recently, American newspapers such as the Chicago Tribune have introduced the power of the newly completed German new long-range bomber to the newspapers, and pointed out that "the possibility of the German Air Force's air raid on the U.S. mainland is becoming more and more realistic," thereby urging the American people to be vigilant. This kind of warning is sufficient to replace the decline. It should be said that it is the article by Henry Taylor published in the American News Paper (America Mercurles). Taylor said in his thesis: "From the coast of Brittany, France, to New York, the straight-line distance is five thousand four hundred and fifty kilometers. According to reliable information, this distance is within the radius of action of the new German bomber. Seversky and other radical air force theorists in the United States are all enthusiastically advocating the bombing of the Japanese mainland, so that the eyes of the people are only facing the other side of the western Pacific, and how can they know that the American people will receive a major threat from the Atlantic behind them. Due to the changes in the European war situation, New York and Washington, which were believed to be absolutely immune to air raids, have to realize that they will be subjected to considerable frequent air raids." According to the special telegram from London from the Swedish newspapers, the situation is the same in the United Kingdom. The military experts in London also attach importance to the performance of the new German bomber and point out that there is a possibility of bombing the U.S. mainland, and point out that Germany's intensification of its submarine operations has put Britain in a state of coercion in terms of both material and spiritual aspects. Because of the completion of the "European Fortress," it will strangle Britain's preparations for launching a second front, as well as other reckless actions. After this spring, Germany will carry out the largest air raid on the British mainland since the start of the war, which is very possible. They also said that the method of the German air raid will be a fierce concentrated bombing aimed at disrupting traffic lines. It goes without saying, and it seems that parachute landing disturbances will be carried out at the same time.</p>
<p>While the U.S. Air Force is clamoring to bomb the Japanese mainland again, rumors that Germany has a new long-range bomber that threatens the U.S. mainland from behind have caused a great shock throughout the U.S. According to foreign telegrams, this long-range bomber is the Messerschmitt 264 aircraft, but its structure and performance are unknown due to strict secrecy. However, the range is known to be 15,000 kilometers, so it can travel from the German-occupied area of France to Washington with ease. Also, if used properly, it is possible to directly bomb the U.S. mainland from Tokyo with this aircraft, as the distance between Tokyo and San Francisco is 8,000 kilometers. It is said that the German military has repeatedly broadcast radio broadcasts recently, announcing that "in retaliation for the U.S. air raid on Berlin, the German Air Force is prepared to bomb the U.S." In response, the U.S. rushed to gather on its coast to prepare more than 500 air raid detection devices, trembling in fear of the German aircraft's attack.

<h3>The Virtuous Words and Deeds of the Old Lady Chongde</h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>Madam Chongde, the mother of Mr. Nie Yuntai, passed away on December 30th of last year at the venerable age of 91. The memorial service is being held today at the Nie residence, number 2028 Jing'an Temple Road. Madam Chongde's virtuous words and exemplary deeds throughout her life are worthy of emulation by the present generation, and are too numerous to mention. This article only selects a few, to express admiration.</p>
<p>Madam Nie Zeng Jifen, the Old Lady Chongde, was the youngest daughter of Zeng Wenzheng Gong, a great figure of the late Qing Dynasty. She was born in Beijing on the thirtieth day of the third lunar month in the second year of Xianfeng (1852 AD), just as the Taiping Rebellion was breaking out in Guangxi. From a young age, she received the family education of Zeng Wenzheng Gong, and her subsequent thoughts and actions followed the traditions of Zeng Wenzheng Gong. In her childhood, she followed Zeng Wenzheng Gong as he moved from province to province, experiencing turmoil and gaining insight into the shortcomings of the country and society. She showed particular sympathy for the plight of ordinary people. Moreover, with the supervision of Zeng Wenzheng Gong, she was especially diligent, thrifty, and studious. At the age of twenty-four, she married Mr. Nie Zhongfang of Hengshan.</p>
<p>What makes the Old Lady Chongde most worthy of emulation is that all her efforts were not only for the sake of her own family's peace, wealth, and honor, but she always considered the peace, happiness, and honor of other families, possessing the virtues of "helping others in need" and "doing good to others." Since the founding of the Republic of China, she resided in Shanghai and gradually came into contact with people in the Christian community. Seeing their spirit of charity, medicine, and service to society, she believed that it was enough to correct the selfish and unpatriotic habits prevalent in society. She gladly accepted Christianity and was baptized in the fourth year of the Republic of China. Every morning and evening, she would kneel and pray to God, bowing her head hundreds of times. What she prayed for, however, was the early restoration of peace in all countries of the world, and the emergence of many wise men in the country and society, never involving her own personal affairs. I ask, how many women in the general intellectual class today can pray so devoutly for the world, the country, and society? We cannot help but particularly admire the Old Lady Chongde and hope that ambitious women in our women's community will rise up and emulate her.</p>
<p>The Old Lady Chongde's love for the world and the country, and her assistance to others, were by no means expressed only in kneeling and praying to God, but were truly expressed in practical life. Read her "Theory of Frugality and Thrift to Save the Nation." She said: "Greed for profit and pride in it is a common evil root in human beings. All the disasters in the world are due to this. Only the ancient sages of our country deeply knew the cause. Therefore, in their governance and education, they promoted virtue and righteousness, and degraded the rich and powerful. Confucius said, 'The gentleman understands righteousness, the petty man understands profit.' Mencius regarded those who are constantly pursuing profit as the followers of Robber Zhi. He also quoted Yang Hu's words, 'To be rich is not benevolent, to be benevolent is not wealthy.' He also regarded merchants who monopolize market profits as base men. Jia Yi and Chao Cuo of the Han Dynasty were great politicians of our country. They severely criticized the extravagant behavior of merchants and wealthy people, which harmed people's livelihoods, corrupted customs, and confused the ritual system, speaking with great pain. Therefore, for thousands of years, we have relied on ritual and education to maintain order, and the social criticism system has become an invisible law. The rich and powerful, even the poor officials, have been somewhat restrained. But today, with the import of European customs, especially from England, rich people are respected as superiors, extravagance is praised, and frugality is despised. Scholars even follow suit, the social atmosphere has changed greatly, and the country's affairs cannot be managed." If today's wealthy people read these words, can they not blush and feel ashamed in their hearts?</p>
<p>However, she never made loud noises to fish for fame and praise. She grew up in a thrifty family environment. Because Zeng Wenzheng Gong started with nothing and took on difficult tasks. At that time, the court and the public indulged in revelry and were accustomed to hypocrisy. Military affairs and governance were extremely corrupt. There were no funds to allocate and no soldiers to fight. Zeng Wenzheng Gong served as a local gentry to organize local militias, and then took overall command of military affairs in various provinces, commanding more than ten thousand soldiers. He led his subordinates with integrity and managed his family with thrift, vowing not to send a single penny from the army to his family. He was finally able to create a good atmosphere and encourage the officers and soldiers of the time to be honest and upright, so that they could work together in harmony and complete the great task of national rejuvenation. The Old Lady Chongde described her childhood life, saying: "My father often wanted to maintain the state of rural life. He did not allow us to use silk for our daily clothes. One day, when a guest came, I wore a gauze jacket with embroidery. After the guest left, Wenzheng Gong came in, looked at it, and asked my mother, 'Why is Man Nu (referring to the Old Lady Chongde) so fancy?' My mother quickly replied: 'I just saw a guest...' We spun yarn, weaved hemp, sewed, cooked, and prepared meals. We had a fixed schedule every day, and we had almost no free time." In fact, not only in her childhood, but even in her forties and up to the high age of eighty-one, she was still accompanied by a loom, taking pleasure in needlework, never seeking ease. Today's so-called modern women are probably far less noble than the Old Lady Chongde, but they have long only known how to enjoy banquets and regard needlework as lowly.</p>
<p>The old lady was so diligent and thrifty, which was closely related to her childhood family education. Wenzheng Gong had set a curriculum for her. After breakfast, she would make side dishes, pastries, wine, and sauces (meals). At noon, she would spin cotton or weave hemp (clothing). After lunch, she would do needlework and embroidery (fine work). At dusk (after 10 PM), she would make men's shoes, women's shoes, or sew clothes (rough work). The Zeng family, both men and women, could not lack any of the four characters: reading, writing, and composing; women could not lack any of the four characters: clothing, food, rough, and fine. A curriculum was set every day. Meals were tested every day, clothing was tested every three days, fine work was tested every five days, and rough work was tested every month. They had two slogans: "A diligent family prospers, a diligent person is healthy," "Those who are diligent and thrifty will never be poor." But she also worked hard to study. She said in her own chronicle: "Guangxuan, the eldest daughter of Hui Min Gong, was betrothed to Li Youxian of Hefei. Her husband's family wanted her to study, so Hui Min taught her Outline and Mirror of History every day, and I always listened from the side. Later, Hui Min did not have time to teach more, so I read it on my own. There was a very large globe made by the Manufacturing Bureau in the boat hall built by Wenzheng Gong in the office, about six feet in diameter. Therefore, we roughly knew geography. Su Cheng Gong had always liked mathematics, so he taught me Tianyuan Gougu Kaifang, which is the modern algebra geometry, and I was able to understand it. My sister-in-law, Madam Guo, also often discussed it with me. The joy of reading history at this time was the greatest." The old lady not only loved to learn and study on her own from a young age, but also continued to study diligently after her marriage. She said in her own chronicle: "Madam Hui Min brought back from abroad wool woven clothes and trousers, and thread woven clothes, which were not easy to see at that time. I asked her about the method of making them, and learned a little. Every time I had free time, I would infer from them and create new styles. Later, I often visited Madam Chuan Lan Ya Jun, and Mr. Chuan was the one who compiled and translated new books for the Manufacturing Bureau. His wife was refined and kind, and I got along well with her, so I learned all her methods. At that time, European and American women also valued family handicraft very much. I felt the importance of foreign languages and science, so I ordered my two sons, Qichang and Qijie, to learn from Madam Fu every day." What is even more commendable is that this spirit of learning was tireless until old age. She wrote the Diamond Sutra every day without tiring. And she did not think that self-study was enough. For decades, she always passed on what she had learned to others, even to her maids. This "knowing and passing on immediately," and "doing good to others" enthusiasm, is precisely the great spirit that our country needs to promote today, isn't it?</p>
<p>Finally, we want to explain that the old lady's unreachable place for ordinary women is that she is tireless in doing good. She often lived frugally herself, and when it came to helping others, especially public welfare, she always rushed to the front. In order to help the poor and sick, she often worked tirelessly, making medicine herself late at night. Isn't this the spirit of religious sacrifice of self to serve the crowd, which is most lacking in our country today? The biggest difference between us writing about the Old Lady Chongde today to express our respect for her and writing biographies and inscriptions for ordinary people is that we do not want to write flattering words for the dead. However, the spirit and actions of the Old Lady Chongde, who worked hard to learn, enthusiastically did good deeds, loved the world and the country, knew and acted immediately, and did so for more than eighty years as if it were a day, are truly enough to influence the end of the world. So how can we not write an article to praise her? Now, with the Old Lady Chongde's own words, I give this to the people of the East: "Gu Shilin said, 'The rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of every man.' I say, 'It is especially the responsibility of every woman.'" Rejecting gorgeous clothes and utensils, being diligent, thrifty, and hardworking, in order to encourage men, jointly creating a good social atmosphere, cultivating the vitality of the country, and ensuring the peace of the world, is this not the reality of our women? I hope that my female compatriots will not regard this as a platitude and ignore it! (See "Theory of Frugality and Thrift to Save the Nation")</p>

<h3>Second Phase of Per Capita Sugar Distribution to Begin the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>After the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office was approved by the military allocation authorities to implement per capita sugar control, the first phase ran from March 11th to March 31st. Recently, the second phase of sugar collection certificates has been approved and issued by the Public Works Bureau and the Food Administration Bureau, based on the retailers who re-registered with the cooperative. Therefore, in the future, those holding certificates can purchase sugar nearby. Retailers have completed procedures such as paying sugar payments. It was originally scheduled to start issuing certificates on April 11th, with a valid period until the 30th. It is now known that due to issues with the delivery of sugar in the second phase, it is impossible to clear the sugar on time, so it is bound to be delayed for a few days. It is reported that the nationwide distribution will begin on the 15th, with the quantity specified as half a catty per certificate, priced at two yuan and forty cents. As for the sugar needed for various industries, special allocations will be made according to the previous methods. It is reported that the special allocation of sugar for March has already begun. Those who have been approved for allocation can collect sugar from designated retailers with a sugar purchase certificate. The specific methods for the second phase of per capita sugar distribution will be announced by the cooperative in conjunction with the authorities.</p>
<h3>Ninth Phase of Food Ration in West Shanghai - Distribution to Begin Today</h3>
<p>The ninth phase of household food rations in West Shanghai will be distributed from today (13th) by 55 retail rice shops. The total amount of household rice to be distributed this time is 51,917 bags of whole rice and 453 bags of broken rice, and it will not be sold together with flour and other grains. Each resident can purchase two and two-tenths liters of whole rice and two and a half tenths liters of broken rice with the ninth phase rice purchase certificate, and the selling price is a total of seven yuan, three jiao, and five fen.</p>
<h3>Planning to Improve the Vegetable Market System - Striving to Simplify the Distribution System - Clearing Supply Sources and Suppressing Prices - Inspecting Food for Hygiene</h3>
<p>The relevant authorities of the two concessions are discussing the current system of vegetable markets. It is said that the reason is to suppress the prices of food in the vegetable markets and to improve the distribution and inspection methods. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Clearing Supply Sources to Suppress Prices</p>
<p>Although the authorities have tried their best to suppress the prices of vegetable markets, the sources of food in the vegetable markets themselves are uncertain. The procedures for vegetable market food to be officially sold by retailers after passing through the hands of rural transporters and wholesalers are more complicated, resulting in less effective results. However, the relevant authorities are now actively trying to make up for the above shortcomings. The approach is to simplify the distribution system and clear the sources of supply.</p>
<p>Inspecting Food to Prevent Transmission</p>
<p>At the same time, in order to maintain public health and prevent the spread of infectious diseases, the authorities have also decided to be meticulous and thorough in the inspection of food in vegetable markets. The health authorities have decided to implement a new food inspection system in various vegetable markets before the summer epidemic prevention campaign is held. It is understood that this new system has been formulated by the health authorities.</p>
<h3>Fire in the Straw Pile at the District Court Detention Center</h3>
<p>A large amount of straw piled in front of the detention center of the Shanghai District Court, which was for the cooking needs of all the inmates, suddenly caught fire at around 11 o'clock yesterday morning. For a time, the fire was very fierce and the black smoke filled the sky. The West District Fire Brigade and the French Concession Fire Brigade all drove to the scene to put out the fire before it was extinguished. It was found that the cause of the fire was a cigarette butt left by a family member of an inmate after visiting the inmate, which was blown by the wind to the straw pile. The total loss was 20,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>Inspection of Qingxiang in Nanhui: Colonel Quan, the liaison officer of the Shanghai Special Municipality, led his entourage to inspect the Qingxiang area of Nanhui on the 10th of this month and returned to Shanghai after completing the inspection that day.</p>
<p>Arrested for Posing as a Fundraiser: Recently, someone has been using the names of well-known social figures and charitable organizations to solicit donations from all walks of life by telegram, lining their own pockets. The Chinese detectives of the Xinzha Police Station arrested six suspects, Fan Bingkun, Huang Yinsheng, Guo Wenqing, Jin Baoqing, Xiang Yiting, and Jiang Yousheng, on Hubei Road the day before yesterday and sent them to court yesterday morning. The defendants have committed many crimes within the concession and will be investigated further.</p>
<p>Women's Welfare Association Free School: The first school of the Women's Free School sponsored by the Shanghai Women's Welfare Association officially opened yesterday (12th), and the second school is scheduled to open on the 15th. Both schools are divided into primary and secondary level courses. Uneducated women are welcome to register.</p>
<h3>Short Commentary: Remember the Rules of the Road</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of the fourth air defense exercise in this city. The entire city was in a state of exercise all day. The personnel participating in the exercise were all mobilized. At the sound of the alarm, they immediately performed their duties in accordance with the predetermined rules, with a tense mood in a calm response. This is commendable.</p>
<p>However, when we look at the pedestrians on the road, although there are ropes on both sides of the sidewalk, many people still do not walk on the left side of the sidewalk, and they cross the road everywhere like shuttles, even breaking the ropes. This kind of inability to obey order and rules is really unacceptable in today's wartime.</p>
<p>The purpose of the rope fences on both sides of the road is to restrict pedestrians to walk on the sidewalk. Originally, our modern citizens should have good habits of obeying order and rules, and there is no need for formal restrictions at all. Therefore, we can also say that this restriction is a kind of warning to us in spirit. Therefore, everyone should consciously abide by the rules of the road, but why can't some people do it, and are willing to receive this spiritual warning?</p>
<p>We hope that the heads of the neighborhood and the parents will earnestly explain to every old and young woman and child in their neighborhood and family that they must do this basic thing of abiding by the law. Remember: "Walk on the left side of the sidewalk, and do not cross the road at will." We must ensure that there are no fences on both sides of the road during future exercises, and that everyone obeys the law and walks on the road.</p>
<h3>Cholera Vaccination Will Be Strictly Implemented</h3>
<p>The police stations in various districts of the Public Concession have recently issued implementation measures for preventive vaccination in each Lianbao area: (1) Please ask each Lianbao chief to instruct residents to implement the vaccination in accordance with the provisions of the cholera prevention vaccination notice issued. (2) Please ask each Lianbao chief to distribute residents of each Bao to vaccinate at the designated location from the start of the vaccination date to May 10th. (3) From May 12th, if there are those who do not vaccinate, the Bao chief will copy the list and send it to this police station. (4) From May 20th, if there are those who do not vaccinate, the Bao chief will bring the household's entire citizen certificate and household rice ration coupon to this police station. (5) Each household head is responsible for the above examples.</p>
<h3>Posthumous Calligraphy of Nie's Mother, Madam Zeng</h3>
<p>Nie Zeng Jifen, the daughter of Zeng Wenzheng Gong, the mother of Layman Nie Yuntai, and later known as the Old Lady Chongde, passed away last winter at the age of ninety-one. Today, a memorial service is being held at her Shanghai residence on Jing'an Temple Road. In her later years, the Madam enjoyed calligraphy and never stopped practicing. Her handwritten family motto and couplet of Wenzheng Gong, "A diligent family prospers, a diligent person is healthy, those who are able to move and are healthy will never be poor," is powerful and precious. Now there is a Mr. Zhu who is willing to share this couplet with enthusiasts, print and sell it, and donate 100 yuan to entrust the Social Service Department of this newspaper to handle it.</p>
<h3>Sports: Zhen Dan Scholarship Charity Match - Donghua vs. Zhen Dan</h3>
<p>A charity football match sponsored by the Zhen Dan University Scholarship Committee will be held at 3:00 pm on the 18th, at the school's stadium. Donghua has been invited to play against the Zhen Dan United Team. Tickets are divided into four types: 10 yuan, 20 yuan, and assigned seats for 30 yuan and 50 yuan. Advance sales will begin today at the Zhen Dan gatehouse.</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper broadcast time was 7:00 pm.</p>
<h3>Economic World</h3>
<p>Since the government sent officials to start investigating hoarding and speculation in this city and reviewing the operations of various banks, the rising trend of commodity prices in recent days has been considerably curbed. In particular, the cotton cloth market has shown a trend towards stability, and people are downstream. Yesterday, the prices of leading fine cloths, Four Gentlemen Serge, and Peach Blossom Ladies' Fabrics were all lower than on the sixth, and there was a tendency for them to continue to weaken.</p>
<h3>Commentary: Loans from Silver Money Industry to Factories</h3>
<p>Throughout history, the industrial development of various countries in the world is fully supported by the financial industry. Industry and finance are like the auxiliary wheels and teeth of a car, interdependent. The financial and industrial circles are like brothers and feet, who should support and cooperate with each other to facilitate the progress of business. In the past, the financial community had organized an industrial loan syndicate to support factories. Although it is a pity that it has not been implemented due to many events in the current situation. Recently, the Silver Money Industry Association, in order to prevent the use of commodity guarantees to finance the growth of hoarding and speculation, decided to limit commodity guarantee loans to members of various industry associations. In other words, from now on, loans from the silver money industry will focus on factories, and the guarantees will be the factory's products and raw materials. This is a normal method of lending in the financial industry, and it is worthy of advocacy and promotion. If we can adhere to this policy and implement it earnestly, then factories will be able to operate flexibly in terms of finance, and can develop as much as possible in terms of production. The revival of Chinese industry may have a hope of realization. I believe that the financial industry should pay attention to the following three aspects when lending to factories:</p>
<p>(1) Attention should be paid to the technical aspects of the factory, and technical experts should be dispatched from time to time to improve each factory, so as to reduce costs and speed up production, in order to achieve the goal of increasing efficiency.</p>
<p>(2) Attention should be paid to the safety of the factory. At the time of construction of the house, arrangement of the machines, and placement of raw materials and goods, attention should be paid to safety aspects at all times, so that loans can be avoided from being in danger.</p>
<p>(3) Attention should be paid to the source of raw materials for the factory and the way out for finished products, and funds should be provided at any time. Mortgage loans should be given more, or acceptance bills should be promoted, so that a part of the funds can do multiple businesses. This is the best way to support industry.</p>
<p>At the same time, I hope that the industry itself should know that in the future, business should be completely focused on the main business, without engaging in external trade and hoarding. Focus on quality improvement and quantitative increase in manufacturing; and strive for customer satisfaction in promotion and enthusiastic sales by dealers in various places, so as to increase business reputation and gain the trust of financiers. This is what industrialists need to work hard to achieve automatically.</p>
<h3>Deputy Minister of Finance Chen Zheshuo Summoned Yesterday - Silver Money Industry Leaders Talked - Explaining the Government's Intention to Thoroughly Investigate Hoarders</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Shanghai Dispatch: In order to thoroughly investigate the general speculators and hoarders in Shanghai, the National Government specially dispatched Chen Zheshuo, Deputy Minister of Finance, and Yuan Yuquan, Deputy Minister of Industry, to Shanghai to discuss the methods of thoroughly investigating hoarders with Secretary-General Zhao of the Municipal Government and Supervisor Chen Yunwen of the Business and Statistics Committee. It is learned that the investigation of bank and money shop lending operations has been clarified. If it is determined that there are speculative and hoarding activities based on the account holders of the funds pledged by banks and money shops, they will be punished according to law. According to sources familiar with the matter, Deputy Minister Chen Zheshuo and others also summoned leaders of the silver money industry for an informal conversation yesterday, explaining the government's intention to thoroughly investigate hoarders and the progress of reviewing bank and money shop lending operations, hoping that the money industry would work hard on its main business and focus on lending operations, and that there would be no impact on the financial community. This thorough investigation of speculators, hoarders, and profiteers is completely aimed at stabilizing commodity prices and ensuring the fundamental strategy of stabilizing living. It is reported that Chen, the Minister of Finance, will return to Beijing within days to report to the government authorities on the progress of the thorough investigation of speculators and hoarders in Shanghai, and then submit it to the Supreme National Defense Council for special punishment.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Food Urges Various Associations to Organize a Joint Association</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Shanghai Dispatch: In order to promote the control work and improve the industrial and commercial organization of the food industry to adapt to the wartime system, the Ministry of Food has repeatedly urged the industrial and commercial groups of food and food under its jurisdiction to quickly organize a joint association. Now the Ministry of Food has completed the planning of the scope of organization of various industries, and will first sort out those related to the control of main foods. In addition to rice, which has a separate organization, it is divided into six categories: flour, miscellaneous grains, eggs, livestock, sugar, and edible oil. All the preparation directors of the joint associations have also been appointed. The Ministry of Food's Shanghai staff, in accordance with the Ministry's order, have been consulting with the preparation directors on the direction of progress. Those who have not yet determined the members of the preparation committee are still under negotiation. It is expected that the joint associations will be established one after another soon. In addition, the Ministry of Food's relevant food industries, in addition to the above-mentioned major categories related to control, have already been organized. Tea, fruits and vegetables, seasonings, beverages, canned foods, brewing, and other industries that are generally recognized as food and beverage in daily life will be sorted out in the second step and are currently being planned.</p>
<h3>Municipal Food Bureau Ordered to Take Over Municipal Agriculture</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Shanghai Dispatch: After the Municipal Food Bureau was ordered to reorganize and establish, the Municipal Government decided to assign the Donggou Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Farm and the Donggou Agricultural Improvement Zone, and the Zhenru Agricultural Improvement Zone, which belong to the Municipal Government, to the jurisdiction of the Municipal Food Bureau for the purpose of increasing agricultural production in the urban area and facilitating supervision. According to the reporter's inquiry, the Food Bureau has now received the order from the government and is preparing to take over, and will take over within days to improve agricultural production in the urban area and increase production.</p>

<p>Central News Agency Shanghai Dispatch: Since the establishment of the Shanghai Special Municipality Revitalization Bank two years ago, its business has developed and its reputation has grown. Now, in order to discuss the increase in sales, it held its first annual shareholders' meeting at 2:00 pm yesterday. More than 20 shareholders attended, including Municipal Government representatives Wu Zhefu and Yuan Houzhi, and business shareholders Chen Shaoyu and Sun Yaodong. Wu Zhefu, on behalf of Mayor Chen, served as the temporary chairman, and reported on the business conditions for the 31st year, the general balance sheet, and the allocation of surplus items.

The entire meeting unanimously passed the resolution, and after the revised articles of association for the capital increase were approved by vote, the meeting adjourned at 3:30 pm.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Japanese Egg Merchants in This City Planning to Organize a Joint Venture - This Year's Output is Double That of Last Year</h3>
<p>In order to unify the egg business, Chinese and Japanese egg merchants in this city are currently organizing a joint venture. The Japanese egg merchants are mainly composed of Yangzi Egg Industry, Zhongzhi Egg Industry, and Neiwai Egg Bank. Chinese egg merchants are also planning to carry out this organization. According to an estimate by an egg merchant, about 1,000 cages (about 70 catties per cage) of eggs are imported into this city every day from various places. The total number of imports this year is estimated to reach about 40,000 cages. This number is double that of last year. The reason for the increase is that the egg prices increased significantly last year, and the number of chicken farmers in rural areas increased, so the egg production also increased.</p>
<h3>Registration of Noodle Product Businesses: Membership Reaches Over Two Thousand Households</h3>
<p>The Municipal Noodle Product Industry Association, in order to adjust the membership of each group to avoid duplication and to facilitate the allocation of flour, applied to the authorities to conduct a general registration starting on the sixth of this month. The deadline has now passed. The registered members total 2,735. Among them, the oil-fried and cooked food group has 595 households with flour cards, 34 households without cards, and 97 households with small permits. The pastry and steamed bun group has 195 households with flour cards, 20 households without flour cards, and 30 households with small permits. The pastry, noodle, and fried dough stick group has 314 households with flour cards, 329 households without cards, and 607 households with small permits. The cut noodle group has 331 households with flour cards and 57 households without cards. The special group has 36 households. The special group consists of those who have registered twice in the past and must be adjusted to determine which group they belong to.</p>
<h3>Second Batch of Cigarette Allocation: Available for Distribution This Week</h3>
<p>Many cigarette shops in the city have recently refused to sell cigarettes individually, citing the exhaustion of allocated cigarettes, leading to high expectations for the early implementation of the second batch of cigarette allocation from the China Tobacco Company. It is now learned that the date for the second batch of cigarette allocation is expected to be realized this week, likely to be processed on Thursday (the 15th). As for the varieties, they are all products of Chinese cigarette factories, and the prices are the same as before.</p>
<h3>The Woolen Fabric Market Last Month</h3>
<p>Looking back at the woolen fabric market in March, among all months of previous years, the market was the tightest. The first ten days were not as firm as the middle ten days, and the middle ten days to the last ten days were even firmer, due to different circumstances. The previously applied increase in price limits was officially approved by the authorities on the 12th of last month. The industry association printed and distributed the new price limit list to each member store. The price of goods from local factories increased by 30%, goods from the East increased by 35%, and goods from England increased by 40%. Now that the National Commercial Unification Association has been formally established, there is no need to issue transport permits for woolen fabric movement. At the same time, it is stipulated that those engaged in wholesale cannot also engage in retail, and retail stores cannot engage in wholesale. As a result, many new stores have joined the industry association. Due to busy operations and increased expenses, the industry association has changed the monthly fee to ten yuan and the membership fee to one thousand yuan. As for the woolen fabric market, due to the scarcity and high prices of raw materials such as wool yarn, there is a shortage of woolen fabric in stock. In addition, with the freedom to transport by car, people's minds have suddenly turned enthusiastic, and demand exceeds supply, causing prices to rise steadily. By the end of the month, the market was even tighter, and most of the circulating funds were in short supply. Most retail stores still hoard goods and refuse to display prices for sale. Although the price limits have been increased by 30% to 40%, some are sold for 70% to 80% to over 100% more. Therefore, it is difficult to purchase woolen fabric for clothing unless you ask a close friend to handle it for you.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Publishes Price Limit Table</h3>
<p>The Information Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council announces that many of the price limits for various items approved by the Council have not yet been published. To remedy this, a detailed price limit table should be compiled, including the approved price limits for all items, for public reference. The Price Control Office has now completed the compilation and printing of this price limit table. The first type has already been published, and the second type, including the remaining price limits, will be printed within two weeks. To save paper and in view of the high printing costs, the Council has printed a limited number of price limit tables. Taxpayers who currently receive the Council Gazette on a regular basis and registered industry associations can apply to purchase this table from Office No. 177 of the Council, with a fee of ten yuan per copy.</p>
<h3>Nanking Economic Bureau Rectifies Industry Associations</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - In order to thoroughly stabilize prices and eliminate black market transactions, the Nanking Municipal Economic Bureau is actively investigating various inventories and their sources. It has also begun to rectify various industry associations, which is expected to be completed before May.</p>
<h3>Hoping to Eradicate Hoarding</h3>
<p>The National Government has specially dispatched Chen Zhishuo, Vice Minister of Finance, and Yuan Yuzhen, Vice Minister of Industry and Commerce, to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate speculation and hoarding by the entire industrial and commercial sector. Once the two officials return to Nanjing, it is expected that specific policies to prevent hoarding will be decided and implemented. The economic circles in the concessions are also taking this opportunity to assist the National Government in preventing hoarding, promoting stable livelihoods, and revitalizing the economy. At the same time, all parties hope that the National Government will not only take temporary measures in this intensive investigation of hoarding but will also carry out the following work to continue promoting the policy of eradicating hoarding.</p>
<p>(1) Establish a Thorough Investigation Organ for Hoarding in Shanghai</p>
<p>The resident Shanghai institutions that guide Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles include the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance, the Financial Institutions Inspection Office, and the Insurance Supervisory Bureau. However, these institutions are all weak, and their strength is not enough to guide Shanghai's economic circles after the war, especially the newly established Financial Institutions Inspection Office, which aims to manage finance, will feel even more difficult. To guide the complex Shanghai economy, at least an institution headed by a high-ranking official at the ministerial level should be established to inspect financial and industrial businesses. If such a long-term plan is not made, whenever major hoarding events occur in the future, dispatching officials from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to Shanghai for short-term thorough investigations will not be enough to prevent the deeply rooted hoarding in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(2) Promulgation of the Hoarding Punishment Decree</p>
<p>According to the National Government's decree announced on the 7th, anyone engaged in speculative trading, manipulating market prices, or disrupting the market will be reported to the Supreme National Defense Council for special punishment once the investigation is verified, regardless of who they are. The seized materials will be confiscated. However, the general public believes that promulgating the punishment decree is the most important way to prevent hoarding and stabilize public morale.

<h3>Translated Commentary: The Development of State Capital</h3>
<p>Special Envoy Chen, who is visiting Japan, met with reporters at the Imperial Hotel on the 10th and answered questions raised by the reporters. In his answers, Chen explained that the Chinese national movement after the war is being promoted with three fundamental principles as its goals. The first of these three fundamental principles is to advance from individualism to nationalism, the second is to shift from free capitalism to state capitalism, and the third is to develop from narrow nationalism to national corporatism. These goals are completely the same as those stated by Wang Jingwei in the Outline of the New National Movement in January last year. Wang said that the reason why the Three Principles of the People could not be fully realized in the past was that nationalism forgot Pan-Asianism, democracy neglected the democratic centralism system, and the people's livelihood could not promote the development of state capital. In these few words, there is profound self-criticism and reflection.</p>
<p>We completely agree with the views of Wang Jingwei and Chen Gongbo, especially believing that seeking the development of state capital should be the focus of the National Government's efforts in the future. Dr. Sun Yat-sen had long noticed the development of state capital and wanted to use it to restrain individual capital. The development of state capital not only helps the social policy aspect but also relies on the publication of state capital to build a new China and increase production, which can be said to be the only shortcut to success. One of the biggest reasons why Japan was able to develop its economy rapidly after the Meiji Restoration was also due to the huge state capital. The achievements reflected by this fact should be reviewed at this moment.</p>
<p>The National Government should strive to mobilize national capital and give it full guarantees for its activities. At the same time, it should no longer cherish the old consortia who have been making eyes at the government and instead strive to revitalize their capital, create basic industries by themselves, and adopt a positive attitude. For industries that require huge capital, the state should operate them, or at least operate them jointly with private businesses, or provide guarantees during the start-up period. Only by implementing these measures can the government have the hope of rapid economic development. Moreover, it is also the best foundation for economic cooperation between China and Japan. We hope that the National Government authorities will show some courage and seriously engage in this issue in order to achieve its practice.

<h3>Insurance Broker Registration Deadline Extended to June 5</h3>
<p>Since the Insurance Supervisory Bureau implemented the registration of insurance brokers and notaries, all registration matters have been proceeding smoothly. According to reporters, the bureau's registration matters were originally scheduled to end on the 5th of this month. However, because there are many brokers, some may not be able to complete the registration on time. Therefore, the deadline has been extended by two months to June 5th. It is hoped that insurance brokers and notaries currently engaged in business will no longer hesitate.</p>
<h3>Intensified Takeover of Properties Where Owners are Absent, Deadline for Supplementary Documents</h3>
<p>The Nanshi Office of the Land and Housing Management Committee for Properties Where Owners are Absent in this city has decided to start with sorting out the registration of properties where owners are absent in the entire district in order to effectively rectify them and ensure the rights and interests of the owners in the district. It will use streets as units to intensify the takeover of properties where owners are absent. All insufficient documents must be verified within 15 days; otherwise, the takeover will be carried out immediately so that the property rights of all absent owners can be protected.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Talk about the Environment</h3>
<p>— Ru Ling</p>
<p>A friend left, leaving a letter saying, "The environment is not good, I decided to leave." Another friend, wrote from a faraway place, saying that the environment there is not good, and plans to come here. Leaving, coming, both saying that the environment is not good, is it strange, does the environment affect a person's career to this extent?</p>
<p>Speaking of the environment, one cannot help but think of the story of the Three Kingdoms, Wei had the favor of heaven, Shu had the support of the people, Wu had the advantage of geography, each had their own environment, but in the end, Sima Zhao took advantage of it. So, until now, I always believe that the environment is not enough to affect a person's life.</p>
<p>It is a commonplace to say that in a difficult environment, one can stand on one's own, work hard, and the more adverse the environment, the more one can stand on one's own feet. But if we carefully distinguish and chew it over, the ordinary commonplace has a steady thought after all. Not all great inventions and entrepreneurs come out of good and beautiful environments. Writers who wield pens all know the saying "文章窮而後工" [Wenzhang qiong er hou gong, "Literature is only perfected in poverty"]. Du Fu produced his great poems in the thorns of the Bronze Camel, I think there is no need to use this to compare the relationship between the environment and career. In popular terms, Watt invented the steam engine, first relying only on a teapot, Edison made inventions in a backyard shack when he was young, Mrs. Stowe used wrapped yellow paper as manuscript paper and created her masterpiece "Uncle Tom's Cabin", which is still a beautiful story in the literary world. Similarly, the great musician Chopin suddenly had an inspiration and wrote the well-known song "Listen, Listen! This Burlesque" on the back of an envelope. If it is said that a harsh environment cannot produce a great career, the above examples are enough to refute this statement.</p>
<p>Sinclair Lewis, in his novel "Arrowsmith," satirized a well-funded, well-equipped, and magnificent medical research association in New York, saying that any true scientist does not need any magnificent equipment in the instrument room, he can only use the attic under his own roof as a research institute, give him a few toothpicks and a few glass tubes, and he can immerse himself in research. Doesn't this further prove that the environment is not enough to hinder a person's will and career?</p>
<p>In today's world of "Entering the Table Together in Darkness, Ten Thousand People Lamenting Together," a land of war, let's stick to our fixed environment and work hard, and stop hesitating!</p>
<h3>Interest and Life</h3>
<p>— Hu Ruoliu</p>
<p>From the perspective of graduation, "interest" for "life" is the driving force behind a successful career. No matter what you do, if you can avoid depression and use interest in your career at all times, you will work hard.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, many failures are due to a lack of interest, so you are depressed and bored with everything, and you give up the idea of "working hard to create a new career."</p>
<p>Liang Qichao once said: "The sentence that Chinese people like to use most when they meet is: "What have you been doing for entertainment recently?" I hate hearing this sentence, as if life is unbearable, and I am reluctantly looking for something to pass the time. If a person lives in this state, I advise him to jump into the sea as soon as possible. I only hate that 24 hours a day cannot be expanded to 48 hours, which is not enough for me to enjoy. I never rest all year round. If you ask me what I am busy with, I am busy with my interests."</p>
<p>The person Liang said is a depressed breather, and the result is that nothing is accomplished. What about Liang himself? I think he is worthy of our imitation because he uses "interest" to motivate his career completely, and the result is that he is respected.</p>
<p>However, many people have interests, but they are not used properly. As Liang said: "Gambling...drinking...being an official...and so on, although they seem interesting in the short term, the result will be "no interest comes together!" So we cannot admit that he is interesting. The nature of all interests must start with interest and end with interest, so the following items can be the subject of interest: (2) Labor and games (3) Art (4) Knowledge."</p>
<p>For all interests, we should also use them in the right things, at least they are helpful to our careers.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must understand its true knowledge; it does not come from outside, but from the heart, for example, eating a forbidden fruit, bitter at first, sweet later, we must work hard without stopping, get considerable success, and the interest will naturally be strong.</p>
<h3>The Depression of the Times</h3>
<p>— Chuan Wo</p>
<p>There is a surging passion, as magnificent and magnificent as the waves of the sea, this is a force that cannot be ignored, this is the source of youth's vitality; but the reality of society is often a place to destroy youth and fool youth, it tries its best to suppress the release of youth's passion, and extinguish the fire of youth's vitality; it cannot guide youth to the path of striving, and even refuses them to step on the path of renewal! In this environment, youth's courage is tormented and reduced everywhere. It is really what is called "the higher the Tao, the higher the demon", however, there are certainly many young people who have the courage and perseverance to stick to the end, and will never be overcome by the demons of society.</p>
<p>In general, the elders who call themselves "experienced" are actually prisoners of the old society, and they "teach" the youth "Learn some skills to deal with people!" "Your attitude is going to hit a wall in society!" "Your methods should be more flexible, your attitude should be more sociable, this is how you will not suffer losses." "...," there are countless words like this, but to sum it up in one sentence is to order the youth to surrender to society, to bow their heads to the old forces, and fundamentally eliminate the ideals of the youth to improve society and the great selfless spirit of the youth! They are the sinners of youth, they "push themselves to others," trying to push their own cowardly failures to the next generation and let them bear them; although, on the other hand, it can also be said that it is for the "good" of the next generation, but is this "good" we can accept? Accepting this "good" is no different from becoming a useless "echoing bug" and a sheep to be slaughtered by thousands of people, accepting this "good" is also no different from abandoning one's own mission to society. But if you don't accept it? The coldness of society and the iron face of the crowd are enough to make you depressed and decadent, and enough to make you fall into a state of loneliness and helplessness: really, the ruthless blow of reality to youth is too great, making them feel great pain, so the shadows of the past that can be missed have invaded the contemplation, grab it, maybe you can get a warm and sweet comfort; at the same time, in despair, the stagnant heart may also be taken to the distant future, where you seem to see a glimmer of hope, it is not impossible to comfort the heart that has lost warmth by holding it vaguely. --But, this is a sad fact, the youth who have detached themselves from reality have lost their vitality in sighs and longing.</p>
<p>However, can youth's decadence be entirely blamed on society? No, half of this responsibility should still be borne by the youth themselves! No matter what, reality is a touchstone of human strength, in the training of each era, the strong will stand upright resolutely, while the weak will eventually be eliminated; moreover, without the baptism of difficult times, great people will not be produced. Therefore, the youth who were born today can be said to be a lucky one of the times, we should cheer and jump for joy!</p>
<h3>The Trilogy of Experience</h3>
<p>— Bai Liao</p>
<p>Every day, I have to pass a road, in fact, I don't have to pass this road, but because people always like to take shortcuts, so I have to pass it every day. This road is not good, it is not worthy of being described with words such as flat and Kangzhuang; it can only be said to be rough. And uneven.</p>
<p>But I am not afraid of its roughness and unevenness, I simply took this road because it was close.</p>
<p>One day, two days, three days………</p>
<p>Today, this is already one day nearly a month later, and I walked this road again, for its closeness, for me to increase my footprints, but today I found that this road is unusually flat.</p>
<p>Unusually flat, of course, does not mean that it is as flat as a smooth asphalt road, but it is much flatter than at the beginning. It is flat because of my walking, my footprints? No, because there are many people walking, many people's footprints.</p>
<p>At this time, I remembered a sentence by Mr. Lu Xun:</p>
<p>The road is trampled out by people. Although I knew this sentence a long time ago, I only now realize this sentence.</p>
<p>Knowing experience is valuable, experiencing experience is even more valuable, and practicing experience is truly valuable.</p>
<p>Young friends! Strive to know your experience, strive to experience your experience in life, and strive to practice your experience in every part of life!</p>
<p>Experience is the most precious knowledge in life.</p>
<h3>Roots</h3>
<p>— Xin Bo</p>
<p>Da Gen was watching the bamboo utensils and wooden utensils displayed for sale. He was studying them, which style was new and good-looking, which one was well-made, and which one was durable.……</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a commotion that came straight from the temple. Amongst it, he could hear bits like 'Fight!…… Fight!……'</p>
<p>"Another fight, this is quite fun, it happens every year." A-Wu, who was enjoying the scenery, said with a smile, obviously gloating a little. As he spoke, he casually bought two catties of water chestnuts and gave a string to Da Gen as a token of appreciation. Da Gen took the water chestnuts without saying anything, still looking at the wooden and bamboo utensils. But quite a few people had crowded into the temple.</p>
<p>The commotion grew louder and louder, and gradually spread from inside the temple to outside. Many people first crowded out of the temple, shouting as well, "Fight! Beat these sons of bitches to death!..."</p>
<p>A group of people pulling and shoving each other, punching and kicking, came out of the temple gate. As soon as they came out, the people on the side rushed up, obviously not to watch the fun but to participate. Thus, the scene of the fight expanded outside the temple gate.</p>
<p>"Haha, how interesting, a good fight!" A-Wu was laughing loudly. "It's best to rush up and give them a couple of blows, to join in the fun!"</p>
<p>The gradual expansion of the scene knocked over quite a few water chestnut vendors, sugarcane carriers, and others who didn't have time to run away. Interspersed in the clamorous voices were the cries of children.</p>
<p>A fifteen- or sixteen-year-old boy, running out and shouting angrily, "The people from Shanbei started it first, the people from Shanbei started it first! They want to avenge last year's grudge, they're beating the people from Shannan, the people from Shannan hurry up and go up!"</p>
<p>Da Gen saw that it was his younger brother Hu Gen, and shouted, "A-Hu, A-Hu, don't mess around!"</p>
<p>Hu Gen saw Da Gen and ran over to say, "Brother, tell A-Wu to go up quickly, several people from Chongwen Town have already been beaten badly."</p>
<p>"Excellent!" As soon as A-Wu heard this, he immediately buttoned up the buttons on his chest, rolled up his sleeves, and plunged into the crowd.</p>
<p>"A-Wu brother! A-Wu brother!……" Da Gen was shouting, meaning to stop him, but it was no use.</p>
<p>"Big brother should go too!" Hu Gen was pulling on the corner of Da Gen's clothes. (29)</p>
<h3>Fifth Place Winner of the February Essay Contest: How to Read and What to Read?</h3>
<p>— Jing An</p>
<p>"Travel ten thousand miles" and "read ten thousand books." I believe that people like this must have a very rich life experience, and their knowledge and scholarship must be very profound.</p>
<p>However, how easy is it to become someone with rich experience and profound knowledge, whose intellectual progress is endless, and who always occupies an outstanding position in society?</p>
<p>In ancient times, many people, due to poverty, could not afford to study. When their "desire for knowledge" was very strong, they often "carved a hole in the wall to steal light," "collected fireflies to read by snow," or borrowed books from others to recite and copy. Such painstaking pursuit of knowledge is worth emulating. However, this is only the superficial behavior. Regarding the question of "how to read and what to read," we must have a deep understanding. Because if you read without a method, how can you achieve the goals of "richness" and "profundity"?</p>
<p>Before discussing this question, we must first clarify what the purpose of reading is. Simply put, the purpose of reading is to "benefit oneself and others" and to "utilize resources for the betterment of life." In other words, the purpose of reading is to help the world and seek the welfare of society. However, many people, during their school years, have worked hard, neglecting sleep and meals, and studying diligently. From the perspective of those students who prioritize "high grades" and "first place," they naturally feel qualified to occupy an excellent position.</p>
<p>However, once they step into the colorful social environment, they are at a loss when encountering problems. Not only is their hard-earned "knowledge not applicable," but they also encounter setbacks everywhere and are ridiculed as "bookworms who are useless." Then, in your own heart, wouldn't you feel a bit of the pain of "all previous efforts being wasted"?</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that the spirit of studying diligently like a "bookworm" is good; but at the same time, we must also pay attention to practice and polishing in application, so that we can achieve the goal of "applying what we have learned." Because the goal of reading is to "benefit oneself and others" and "utilize resources for the betterment of life," and we live in a vast and complex society that is "new every day," many things cannot be ignored. Therefore, we must read and experience life at the same time so that we can enrich our wisdom and acquire practical applications. Then, what should our attitude and method of reading be? I believe that the most important points are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Have an understanding of the needs of the times.</p>
<p>(2) Have the vision to choose and understand.</p>
<p>(3) Have the perseverance to take notes and annotations.</p>
<p>(4) Have the spirit of research and discussion.</p>
<p>(5) Have the experience of observation and investigation.</p>
<p>Since the attitude of reading is as described above, then what books should we read? Regarding this question, I remember that Mr. Lu Xun once said that those who study social sciences may wish to read literature, art, natural sciences, and other books when they have the opportunity; similarly, those who study specialized technologies should also read philosophy, literature, psychology, history, geography, law, and other books that seem unrelated to their own field when they have the opportunity. In this way, on the one hand, you can regulate your interest in reading, and on the other hand, you can use the advantages of other subjects to supplement the deficiencies of what you have learned. Because the world is changing rapidly, we must seek knowledge from many aspects to adapt to the needs of the environment. This is the attitude that must be adopted in reading and self-cultivation in the present era.</p>

<h3>Remembering Children's Day</h3>
<p>But how could Dad be so cruel? Every time Xiao Hong saw a small reed mat rolled up on the open space at the door, she would spit on it more than a dozen times. But now, her younger brother is also...</p>
<p>Thinking and thinking, Xiao Hong arrived at the entrance of the park.</p>
<p>There were even more people this time. Electric cars were fully loaded and unloaded their passengers here. The streets were also full of groups of students in fresh clothes and small leather shoes, making crisp sounds. Some were accompanied by adults, carrying large bags of candy, pastries, and other things. No one came to buy Xiao Hong's peanuts and beans.</p>
<p>Carrying her basket, she followed behind two adults and a child in Western clothes who had just gotten out of a rickshaw, involuntarily squeezing in.</p>
<p>"Get out of here, you little beggar!" A thunderous voice rang out from beside the iron railing.</p>
<p>She was startled and almost dropped her basket. She looked at the face of the police officer and took a deep breath.</p>
<p>"Damn it!" -- She cursed in her heart.</p>
<p>But the two adults and the child in Western clothes finally squeezed in. Others also squeezed in one by one. Large groups of elementary school students also squeezed in. The only one who couldn't squeeze in was Xiao Hong.</p>
<p>She returned to the fence and placed the basket on the stone in front of her.</p>
<p>On the lawn inside the fence, the children were still there, and they were playing! Twenty or thirty people sat in a large circle. A boy in a green suit was walking around the outside of the circle, dropping a handkerchief behind a girl in a pink dress. The girl immediately noticed and picked up the handkerchief to chase him, but he ran fast, ran around the circle, and snatched the girl's empty seat to sit down...</p>
<p>"Ha..." Twenty or thirty people, including two female teachers, clapped their hands and cheered.</p>
<p>Several adults and eight or nine children watching nearby also laughed.</p>
<p>Xiao Hong also forgot herself and laughed.</p>
<p>But the laughter suddenly turned into her younger brother's urgent voice: "Xiao Hong! ... Xiao Hong! ... Something terrible! ... Go back quickly! Jin Di was kicked by the police! ... His head is broken..."</p>
<p>"What happened?" Xiao Hong picked up the basket and ran.</p>
<p>The room was dark and crowded with people. Jin Di closed his eyes and slept in his mother's arms, his head and face covered in bright red blood.</p>
<p>"Fetch some cold water!" Her father's rough voice.</p>
<p>Xiao Hong immediately took a broken basin, jumped onto the road, and went to the pond beside the railway opposite.</p>
<p>After scooping up water, she raised her head and took a breath.</p>
<p>Five or six kites floated in the sky, probably released by the children in the park!</p>

<h3>Report on the Solicitation of Winter Clothing Donations by Public and Private Primary and Secondary School Students</h3>
<p>Last autumn, students of Aurora University in Shanghai, in view of the rising cost of living and the difficulties of the poor, launched a winter clothing donation campaign. Led by the male and female departments of the university, they invited Xuhui Middle School, Xiaoming Girls' Middle School, and the Sino-French Academy, Nagela Primary School, Saposai Primary School, Louis Primary School, Potential Virtue Primary School, and Qiude Primary School to donate separately. They also invited the French Cultural Radio Station to report the names of the donors and the amount of donations every day. In addition, alumni Hu Guoqiao and Fei Xizhen, in addition to donating items for sale, also invited famous Peking opera performers for voluntary performances with Hu Fangming, Cao Shiying, Li Yang, Yan Zhi Zhao, Chen Xiangquan, Hu Guopei, and Ms. Wu. The university also performed a drama. A total of 138,647.65 yuan was raised, and 1,854 sets of winter clothing of various sizes were purchased. Together with cash, they were handed over to the male and female departments of the university, the Fujian Fellow Association, the 29 districts of northern Jiangsu, and charitable organizations outside the city for distribution. The campaign lasted three months before it came to an end. It is truly commendable that the students of the university can devote their kind hearts and accomplish this good deed during their spare time. The number and amount of donations, detailed income and expenditure accounts, etc., have all been posted at the university.</p>
<p>The China Amateur Library is located on the seventh floor of the Pudong Fellow Association at the intersection of Edinburgh Road and Chengdu Road. Since the establishment of the board of directors, it has actively adjusted its organizational structure, revised its regulations, and made significant progress in its library affairs. The number of readers has increased dramatically. Recently, it has launched a campaign to solicit books and readers, and the response from all parties has been very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Small Loans: Anonymous Mr. Zhao 500 yuan, Qiu Wenqing 100 yuan, He Hongsheng and Liang Guangai 30 yuan each, Wang Qingyan 20 yuan, and Mr. Zai 15 yuan. A total of 695 yuan was collected in storage coupons, leaving a balance of 9,835 yuan.</p>
<h3>Disabled and Distressed Children Should Be Rescued First</h3>
<p>— Wang Jingyuan</p>
<p>Your newspaper recently launched a children's welfare symposium to discuss issues such as funding and care for distressed children. I cannot help but express my opinion that the "issue of education and care for disabled and distressed children" also needs attention. The creation of distressed children involves countless tragic facts: families broken, people dead, displacement, and extreme suffering. In addition, being disabled, those without arms cannot work; those paralyzed cannot move freely; those who are blind are in a dark hell all day long; those who are deaf and mute cannot hear sounds or speak, and cannot express their sincere intentions, leading to a lifetime of depression and ignorance. How sad! If these disabled people are fortunate enough to have a family or receive the legacy of their fathers and brothers, they can receive appropriate education to compensate for their disabilities. Now that they are both disabled and distressed, and have suffered disasters, there is no more tragic event in the world. Everyone has a heart of compassion. I hope that we healthy people can demonstrate human sympathy and mutual aid to rescue them.</p>
<p>Shen Bao has launched a fundraising campaign of 100,000 yuan to commemorate this year's Children's Day, to be used for the emergency relief of street children. This act of benevolence is admirable. However, it is hoped that disabled street children should be rescued as a priority and distributed to special education and care institutions, where education and care are combined to alleviate their suffering and transform useless disabled people into useful citizens who can benefit the country and society. Today, on behalf of a group of pitiful disabled compatriots, I sincerely pray to Shen Bao and all philanthropists for their success in this endeavor, which will bring boundless merit. The Fuyu School at 33 Huangjiasha Garden Road and the Blind Children's School at 290 Hongqiao Road have a long history and excellent results in running education for the disabled. However, they have recently been greatly affected by prices and are in extreme financial difficulties. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will generously donate to support education for the disabled. For donations, please call 32946, and someone will be sent to collect them."</p>
