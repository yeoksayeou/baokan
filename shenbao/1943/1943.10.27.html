<p>社評</p>
<h3>倡辦驛運</h3>
<p>大東亞戰爭在進入決戰的現階段中，自以爭取勝利為第一義。依照目前趨勢，勝利的基礎雖已奠立，可是最後的完成，仍待各方面努力。現代戰爭稱為總力戰，所謂總力，是包括一切直接間接與戰爭有關的力量，軍事固屬重要，而政治經濟也同樣的重要。我們旣已是參戰國家，必須在總力範圍以內的各部門，各別盡其最大努力，蔚成强大的總力，完成勝利。</p>
<p>交通運輸，負人力物力的流通責任，在戰爭中需要的迫切與廣大，盡人皆知。運輸能力的强弱，為決定戰爭勝負的主要因素之一，也無待鰲述。所以，我們今天在協力友邦日本爭取最後勝利的階段中，對於加强運輸能力一事，無疑是當務之急</p>
<p>其次，就民生經濟的觀點，物資的疏通，供求的調節，也須賴於運輸的流暢，因此，論物價問題者，都以運輸阻滯列為物價高漲的主要因素之一。我們盼望物價回跌，就須設法疏通運輸，這從解決民生問題而言，增强運輸能力，也是當務之急</p>
<p>增强運輸能力，在理論上，固屬刻不容緩的必要之舉。可是，事實上的困難，當然所在多有。主要的是汽油的缺乏，使公路汽車與航運輸舶因燃料問題而無法暢通，其次，汽車輸舶與零件的不足，我們的重工業，造車及造船工業均極落後，往昔大部分仰給國外，自外航中止來源斷絕以後，國內又未能生產，故於現代運輸工具之缺乏情狀，極為可憐。同時，燃料的取給，更為困難。因此，目前的運輸能力，不但不能比較以前增强，也許益見减低，這是極為嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>然而，運輸間題，旣極重要，在情勢上不能不設法補救。因此，我們提出驛運辦法，以為今日環境下解決運輸之一助。驛運制度由來已久，濫觴於周，迨元代而大備。至淸時更趨周密。但歷代郵驛，僅限於傳遞公文，與運輸意義不盡相同。而舉凡驛站之組織管理，經費行程等等，均足以資考據。如何仿照古代驛站制度，利用人力及獸力，因地制宜，按程設站，站站相遞，以收增强運輸能力，允宜首先加以研究規畫者。</p>
<p>驛運之單位較小，遞運之時間較長，其效能自不可與現代交通工具，同日而語。但運輸要旨，不全在於一時一地之快速，並求其經常源源之不斷。因此，具有持續力之運輸，不論其應用之工具為何，要皆為主要之運輸。驛運之精神與價值，即在於持久不斷，川流不息。惟是驛運　作，頭緒繁重，且以動力為主，動力物源之取得，尤以運伕為骨幹，故驛運之進進仃，實以科學管理與動員民衆為前提條件，以科學方法，合理管制，才能馭繁如簡；動員民衆，發動民力，才能克舉實效</p>
<p>我們感於運輸問題之重要，　　事實環境，提出驛運辦法，亟盼政府當局與社會各界注意及之。如何規畫，如何策進，容再文論之。</p>
<h3>臨時議會昨開幕　日皇賜優渥勅語　期億兆一心完成戰勝目的</h3>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　日第八十三屆臨時議會開院典禮，二十六日於日皇陛下親臨下，在貴族院全體會議塲嚴肅奉行。日皇陛下着陸軍軍裝，佩用　章及　章，由百武侍從長及松平宮相等隨同，於上午十時四十五分起駕宮城，十一時駕臨會塲，各議員行最敬禮，日皇陛下當賜以優握勒語，開院典禮告終後，日皇陛下於十一時十五分還駕宮城。</p>

<h3>八三屆議會席上　日首相施政演說　全力遂行決戰重大職責</h3>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　日東條首相於第八十三屆臨時機會之施政演說如次：當此開院典禮，　聖上賜以優遲勒語，誠不勝惶恐感激之至，於此深期與諸君共奉聖旨，舉全力以遂行決戰下之重大職責，俾早日達成戰爭目的，而安聖慮，大束亞戰爭爆發以來，迄今已將二年，皇軍將士克服一切困雖，於聖威之下，摧毀敵人之執拗反攻，戰果已愈擴大　余與諸君對於皇軍將士之善謀　戰、功高勞苦，尤應衷心感謝，同時於此機會願與諸君對殉國勇士謹致　弔之忱，並祈望受傷將士早日痊愈，再起奉公，軍對各遺族衷心表示同情，一方亦令人思及槍　國民諸君，不斷送其弟兄於前綫，專心致力於戰力之增强，使前綫將士無後顯之憂，縱橫發揮其戰力，對於國民諸君功續及勞苦之忱，余顯與睹君共同表示甚深之謝意。</p>
<p>戰力充沛</p>
<p>綜觀現下之戰局，　英。美於睹戰慘敗以來，因大東亞各民族　帝國為中心，團結愈益　密，其豐富寶源之戰力，帝國之戰力已急見充沛，敵人英。美因驚於此種事實，乃決意對帝國實行一大反攻，以謀打倒帝國，於是敵人英。美遂冐一切危險，不擇手段，出以反攻，故戰鬥日趨激烈。當此彼等敢行猛擊之時，帝國亦決心予彼等以猛擊，摧毀敵人戰力，以確保勝利，當此堅迫時機，吾等國民所應盡之責任，亦僅有急增强力之一途，敏速　　　備，堪可摧毀英美之　勝戰戰力，以應前綫之要求，惟　此責任決非易事，如前之所想所行，決不能有所成就，必須全體國民眞正祛除一切惰性，排除一切障碍、傾舉一切力量，方可有成，况戰局之演變，決不許吾人有寸刻之猶頂也，政府前此所以制定「當今情勢下之國政施行要綱」者，即在于此，此次奏請召開議會，而祈審議有關時局之各種緊急議案者，其原因亦在此。此次政府擬刷新國政之實施，其目的在使統帥與國務之關係　形緊密，幷謀推行活潑之戰爭指導方策，實行靈　之對外施策，協力完成戰爭，並加强國內諸般態勢，强化國內態勢之目標，即以不屈不撓　　，急速增强軍需生產，力謀擴充航空戰力，以此為中心，澈底加强帝國之協助態勢。今日為我一億國民全體從事戰鬥配置，官民一致以新生氣魄集中總力於大戰之時期、政府于此種信念下，決心不拘過去當應之傳統，排除一切障碍，施必要之施策，</p>
<p>加强內衛</p>
<p>關於加强國內情勞之具體方策，已有屢次之發衷，其重要者　行政決戰化，擴大國民官員，加强國內防衛態勢，政府為振作民心，統一國力，自應採取萬全措置，以爲實　此等方策之基本措置。政府基於以上旨趣，刻已急速着手實行强化國內態勢之方策，　　行政決戰化之方策，首先決定設置農商省，軍　省，運輸通信省，整備行政機構，大量縮减公務人員，並謀刷新官廳事務，使預算澈度單純化之方針。至國民動員之擴大，則從速實行，停止學生等一般之徵集猶豫，擴大徵時範圍，使之普　化等措置，並已決定關於教育之戰略非常措置。關於國內防衛態勢之加强，為統一國內防衛方策，另設防空總本部，並決定疏散人口及設施等方針，余認今强化國內態勢之是否迅速澈底實行，即亦決定大東亞戰爭之成否，政府有鑒於此，對已決定事項之實行及應着手之幾多事項，決以堅强不斷態度臨之，俾期舉得成果，滿足作戰上之要求。政府於此空前重大戰局下，切望國民諸君衷心協力，帝國為自存自衛，必倔起排除一切陳碍，相信此意義重大，戰爭最後勝利必　我人，囘顧開戰以來之作戰經過，靜觀大東亞之現勢，及彼我攻防戰之大勢，我等必勝之信念愈形堅周，况我一　官民　戰局之現階段為轉機。悉從事戰鬥配置，為天皇陛下集中總力於擊滅英，美一點，今後我等之前途實僅有勝利。</p>
<p>歐洲情勢</p>
<p>再就歐洲之情勢以　，義巴特里奧派，恬不知恥之背叛行為、固為吾等所深為遺憾者，但彼等之行徑，徒使義國民陷於走頭無路，飽受　炭之悲運，而軸心國必勝之態勢，並未　動、且由於希特勒元首所採敏捷而適當之措置，得使　索里尼統帥東山再起，斜合祖國同志，樹立共和政府　與日·德兩國　益同心戳力而向擊滅英。美之目標邁進日·德兩國政府　對　　新共和政府已卽　予以承認，故余　　統帥之東山再起實衷心表示慶祝，同時亞祈　今後勇往奮鬥，於今德國為　應歐洲戰局之新局面在舉國一致之決意下，已準備妥善之　付方策、實行國內大規模總動　　於歐洲樹立穩　之體勢，並在準備新作戰計劃帝國確　盟邦德國將於此新作戰而收獲所期之戰果，且與帝國相携而使英·美屈服之時日近。此外再視東亞之　勢解放多年來為英　野心而塗炭之大東亞各國家。各民族，使脫出殘酷枷鎖之偉大事業，己以堅　之步伐築成穩固之基礎，　　前此緬甸之獨立及今之菲律賓獨立，即可知一般。帝國基於國際之信義，故凡與所約必使其實現，此誠八　一字肇國大理想之表現，亦即帝國之基本理念，如今滿洲國方面國民上下一致，　　　　，與帝國之邦　日益　　，且對帝國自物心兩方面予以協力，於茲帝國對　協力之情深表感謝，同時更盼其前途無量發展。</p>
<h3>改訂中日條約　即將具體化　遂行戰爭意見已一致</h3>
<p>又關於中華民國方面，帝國自本年伊始，即根據既定方針，積極進行交還租界，以暨若干案件之具體擔　，此巳為衆所　知之事實，又關於改訂中·日條約事宜，最近即將具體化。前此國民政府汪主席訪日之時，曾與余晤談，彼此就中·日兩國。同遂行戰爭之遂徑開成交換意見，已完全一致，余對此為達成「中國人之中國」之　想及爲大東亞十億民衆之解放而邁進之氣魄，衷心表示敬意，當此之際，渝方仍在兄弟閱　，不得參與中國更生之雄圖，更不能共同從事大東亞民族共同事業，實表遺憾，但余對淪方治下之民衆，則深具同情之念。</p>
<p>關於泰國</p>
<p>曾將馬來北部四州及　部二州編入泰國領土，現日·泰兩國關係日加敦　，對於泰國之協力，帝國深為感謝，同時帝國為泰國之興隆，亦深願予以全副協力。關於緬甸，該國已於八月一日，宣告獨立，緬甸呻吟於英國之　追下，已非一日，然及大東亞戰爭　發，緬甸乃決然　起，對帝國寄以全幅協力，今則緬甸民衆之　年夙願已　達成，其獨立已終得實現，於此，余與諸君黨新同視緬甸國之獨立及其今後之發展，同時切望其與帝國協力於大桌亞防衛之第一綫繼續奮鬥，帝國為緬甸國之與隆，亦顯竭盡援助之勞。十月十四日，吾人已目</p>
<p>覩菲律賓</p>
<p>共和國之獨立，於茲菲律賓已脫離　四百年之久之異民族支配已由最近四十年來美國之欺瞞壓迫下，獲得解放，　八百萬之菲島民衆，現於洛勒　大　統　導下，在建　「菲島人之菲島」之同時，與帝國協力完遂大東亞戰爭，其於道義以　　大東亞，帝國　於菲律賓國民此種　　，除祈望其權利潤展外，為完成其事業，更願予以一切協力。</p>
<p>再觀印度</p>
<p>四億　衆，現仍於英國壓迫下呻吟，加之最近美國亦伸其侵略印度之魔手，印人痛苦實有不　言狀者，由於英美之　政與英美軍之檔暴，彼等興印人間之衛突，愈　激化，致引起深刻之社會混亂，印度終陷於空前之　荒浩刦中，此等慘狀日趨惡化，英美亦承　此點，印度志士悉被英當局　捕入獄，一般無辜民衆坐以待斃，此　為世界之悲劇，亦為人類所公憤者，斷不容我　持旁觀態度，今秋印度志士　特拉鮑斯氏等，為解放國一致崛起，本年十月廿一日，樹立印度臨時政府，帝國已於廿三日表明承諾該政府，今後帝國　始終支　該政府，以協力態度，完成獨立與斛放，此種決意。得　由本議　明中外，本</p>
<p>不勝欣快</p>
<p>之至，　印度之完全獨立與自由，及其四億民衆永遠之繁榮，乃帝國衷心所希望者，帝國之目的自在獲得大東亞全民族之誠心協力，余更相信此可博得余世界人士贊同，同時印度　放運動與大東亞民族之協力，必可使印獲得獨立自由與繁榮，以上係衷明政府臨此重大時局之信念，甚望諸君諒解政府決意、並予以衷心協力，關於此次政府提出之預算案及法律案，切望　君審議後予以協贊。</p>

<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　蘇軍為於冬季以前，攻破聶伯河防綫，故數日來，德蘇兩軍在聶伯河河套及梅立託波爾附近展開決戰，聶伯河戰局之歸趨，可由是役決定。</p>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　海通社訊：大聶伯河套與克里米亞門戶之爭奪戰，上週杪巳進入新階段。蘇軍復以精銳部隊企圖突入克里受卓與尼普貝特羅夫斯克間之克里伏洛格，並加重其兩　壓力。巳獲渡過聶伯河，在尼怕貝特維夫斯克樹立之新橋頭堡，但戰事重心仍在克里伏洛格，敵以重兵進犯，吾軍即予反攻。德軍在諾蓋斯草原之陣地。仍為蘇軍猛攻之目標·不斷襲擊柴普基東南之德軍陣地工企圖沿聶伯河下海突入尼柯波爾，怛二十三日與二十四日敵軍在柴普魯與與亞索夫海間之進攻，均被吾軍予以重創擊退·基輔區戰事漸見鬆弛，蘇軍進攻斯摩倫斯克明斯克公路，企圖突入奧爾厦，卒因德軍防綫堅强，並未獲逞。</p>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　據此間軍事當局宣稱為實行德軍最高當局之縮短陣綫計劃起見，德軍巳於星期一由尼普貝特羅夫斯克（Dniepropetrovsk在克里曼卓之東南）實行有計　之撤退，當撤退時，德軍並　與敵激·撤退之部隊極有秩序，且巳將一切軍火及軸重運至新陣地，後軍早在眩城作撤退之準備，敵軍縱巳佔領，亦未能芡得其軍事之價值。</p>

<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　德國新聞社訊德步兵隊在猛攻砲與機械化平射砲掩護之下，已順利。成其對戈美爾以南蘇軍外頭部隊之軍事行動，該地域情形特殊，不易偵察，但德軍不顧種種困難，終於在星期日切斷蘇軍與後方之聯絡。並道其侷處於最狹隘之區域。蘇軍高級司令部力圖由外面解救被圍之蘇軍，為德軍堅決之抵抗所阻。斯摩倫斯克至奧爾厦公路兩旁之防禦戰，仍在進行中，公路以北之戰事尤為劇烈，蘇軍進攻雖猛，但德軍所有防綫均在固守中，少數局　缺口經德軍立即反攻後　卽告塡平，就一般之情形而言。德軍在斯摩倫斯克之西可謂巳獲得決定性之重大勝利。</p>
<h3>蘇軍後備兵　集中四焦點</h3>
<p>同時蘇軍巳將其所有可調之後備兵，全數集中四處焦點，蘇軍於數日前尙力圖向各處進攻，以使尋獲德軍兵力薄弱之地點，而今則增調後備兵集合於下列西大據點，即　亞素夫海與聶伯　河套之間　尼普貝特羅夫斯克之西北</p>
<p>戈美爾之南以及　沿斯摩倫斯克至奧爾厦之公路。星期日各該據點仍在進行激戰，紅軍雖以大隊坦克車　砲隊以及其他重砲進攻·但任何一處均未能　破德軍之陣綫·亦未能深入德軍之陣地，敵坦克車數集團攻破德軍陣綫缺口數處　但立即為德軍後備兵所攔截而于以殲滅。東棧南部在克里伏洛格之北，德坦克車隊發動猛烈之反攻，並奪獲敵坦克車不下六十二輛。</p>
<h3>藉濃霧掩護　作渡河企圖</h3>
<p>蘇軍以步兵四師團與坦克車二旅團在梅立托波爾之兩旁進攻，雙方激戰達數小時之久，結　敵坦克車被整毀三十輛，近晚蘇軍突被德軍陣綫一處，使德軍不得不將其陣綫撤退數公里，雙方激戰終晚，至星期日上午戰事仍在進行中。蘇軍在重霧之掩蓋下，在尼普貝特羅夫期克之兩旁建立小規模之橋頭堡二處，但此種橋頭堡並無重要性。克里伏洛格以北之德軍防綫遭功軍進擊甚劇，但敵之進攻均被攻退，蘇軍在該處損失坦克車三十五輛當德軍坦克車隊發動反攻時切斷蘇車一集團並奪獲敵坦克車六十二輛星期日蘇軍共損失坦克車一百九十七輛死傷亦怕當重大。</p>

<h3>伏河北岸德軍　守有利陣地　砲火猛烈擊退攻勢</h3>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：義大利南部過去數日之戰事行動中，德軍在廿巴尼亞平原與亞平青由中三處據點，對英美軍人數優　之進攻，獲得防　上之勝利，同時並實行其預定計劃中縮短陳械之策略。德後　兵所採用之方法，已請明極有效力，彼等不但截阻英美軍之進攻，並且在有力之反攻中擊退之。星期日在此種戰事行動中，敵軍損失戰車十四輛與偵察坦克車八輛，此外其他戰具與人力之損失亦重大。德軍防禦上之勝利甚大，故當德軍在上述據點分遣時，美軍並不追隨。據來自該區戰塲之載告，伏爾托諾河以北之德軍，巳移入斯巴拉尼斯附近山脈上極有利之陣地，此種天然之屏障，使德軍防守順利，英美軍數次猛攻。均不得逞，反而損失一旭門一坦克車九輛與裝甲　察車三輛。星期日下午由擲彈兵　高射砲手所合組而成之德衝鋒軍二隊，由側而發動突襲，擊退美軍　援隊，並竄入若千英美軍集團之後方，結果英美軍急向南退去。沿伏爾托諾河上游德軍後防隊砲兵　　攻行近之美軍縱隊而擊散之，予美軍以極重大之損失，德軍前綫之美軍最後均為　衝鋒隊所掃淸。巴拉尼洛區科倫丹契斯削近德送防隊、與英加軍猛攻隊彼此作戰甚劇烈　敵企圖抵達福查至羅馬之公路未成，而改向側面進攻，及至進入德砲隊之範圍內，即遭德砲之　擊，砲彈如雨而下，於是敵之企圖遂告崩潰。加拿大坦克車與偵察坦克車實行解救之企圖，結果被擊毀」旭門」坦克車五輛與偵察坦克車二輛，加拿大增援軍在德軍反攻中被擊退，結異又有「旭門」坦克車二輛與債察坦克車一輛被擊毀。傍晚敵由戰地將其死傷之兵士曳之而歸，同時德後防隊追隨大隊德軍之後而未遭敵之阻擾。英第八軍仍在繼續整頓共部隊，英　塞隊一隊向　時諾河上橋　一座猛攻，尚未抵達該橋梁之前，即被擊退，戰俘一批落入德軍手中。</p>
<p>高山為屏障拔海二千尺</p>
<p>柏林廿六日中央社電海通社訊：德軍在義南山區內之作戰已佔優勢，敵軍兵力與物資雖優，但作戰行動巳受阻礙，雖調蘇格蘭與加拿大軍隊至山區作戰，，亦未收成效，故上週杪敵軍毫無成就、其局部進展，在戰略上井無意義。美軍向卡浦亞北　山口推進之軍隊，巳於廿三日遭德軍反攻，予以重創擊抵。停留在羅契達典斯巴拉尼斯附近一部份美第五軍，在阿哩夫迤東與比台衆特亦無特殊活動。德軍在拔海二千公尺瑪泰資山所守之陣地，旣能遏阻敵軍之進展，復能控制文契亞托洛。康達魯浦，伊當尼亞之通路，此皆為英第八軍左翼一再　犯之地區。康波契亞洛附近文契亞托洛西南數公里之處，　敵軍之後衛，德軍曾於廿三日向之實施突襲，英軍即在驚惶中潰散。甘波巴索方面敵軍亦改取守勢，共第八軍右　在比　諾與特里格諾略有進展，但幷未術過魯西托蒙泰尼洛一綫。其向特里格諾推進之先頭部隊已遭遇吾軍之堅强抵抗。</p>

<h3>日軍戰况</h3>
<p>陸相報告</p>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　陸日相東於條二兼十六日貴衆兩院之全體會議中報告戰况，其內容如次：前次議會召開時，余曾報吿戰况，茲再就以後戰事一般之推移、報告如下，（第一）</p>
<p>北東方面</p>
<p>關於阿圖島之戰况，余屢次在議塲中曾巳詳細說明，駐守基斯加然不覺，對無人之基斯加島繼續轟炸，幷砲擊者約有二　餘，至八月十五日始在該處登陸。其後敵機又來襲北千島，每次經大本營營表，來襲之敵機前後為數約三十架，其半數巳被日軍擊落，餘者至少有三分之一受創。（第二）</p>
<p>新幾內亞</p>
<p>所羅門方面，新幾內亞方面日軍一部隊，在今春以來，在薩拉摩亞南方地區與優勢之敵軍對峙，迄至六月三十日、敵軍一部在薩拉摩亞東方登陸，又於九月四日及二十二日一部强力敵軍分在拉埃，芬希哈罕附登陸，該方面日陸　軍航空部隊相互協力攻擊之，各方而日軍地上部隊亦同時一致行動，刻正攻擊芬希哈罕方面之敵軍，展開激戰中，又在薩拉摩亞及拉埃附近戰鬥之日軍、予敵以重創、於卞月中旬集合於拉埃北方地區。又孟達南方地區之日軍部隊，自十月上旬以來，與進抵拉姆河上游右岸之敵軍交戰中，該方面之敵航空勢力，在第一綫約有飛機千二百怨，後方約有千八百架，敵軍之戰術，以優勢之空軍不先導，腳踏實地，按步進行作戰，日陸海軍航空部隊於密切協力下，或遠出攻擊敵航空基地，或就近直接協力地上部隊之戰鬥，以掩護日軍　方根據地及運輸船團，統計最近日軍航空戰鬥之戰果，其比例為日機犧牲三架，敵則為數倍，被擊落，或擊毀，日軍航空部隊將士之卓絕戰技與激鬥精神，常在局部戰鬥中獲得赫赫之戰結，日軍地上部隊亦不屈不撓，充分發揮日軍之戰鬥精神。六月以後在新幾內亞方面予敵之損害，曾擊落或擊毀敵機五百架，擊沉或擊毀敵艙十八艘，運輸艙約四十艘，舟艇約五十艘以上，在地上戰鬥中，敵軍之損害至少超過一萬四千名，日軍鹵獲大砲軍械極夥，綜合俘虜所言及其他情報，敵之損害尤以人力消耗量為大。（第三）南方及</p>
<p>緬甸方面</p>
<p>之航空有戰，現巳漸形激烈，本年六月以後，每月來襲敵機數約達一千架之多，迄九月更增加至千六百架，始終繼濟激烈之戰鬥，該方面敵航空實力，推定在第一綫飛機約有千架左右，日陸軍航空部隊刻在緬甸，越南，泰國、馬來方面極廣泛之地域，擔任空防。又在孟加拉　成蘇門答臘，爪哇島南卞海上全域從事巡　任務，並準備伺機攻擊西北澳洲方面。又滇緬邊境日軍，突於十月中句出渝軍之意外，開始進攻，在怒江上游包圍渝軍之强力部隊，伸渝直系軍隊遭受重創，刻正繼續戰鬥中、敵軍迭次高呼反攻緬甸，今其行動已漸成熱，日軍巳强化後方面防衛態勢，準備發動次期作戰。（第四）</p>
<p>中國滿洲</p>
<p>方　莊況，駐渝美空軍推定美　飛機合計約三四百　其中有美空軍之長距離轟炸機、刻止企圖攻擊日本本土，日空軍自本年七月以後，相繼進攻重慶，衡州，零陸，建甌。寳慶。桂林，昆明等地美空軍根據地，予以重創，崔毀其反攻企圖，鞏固防衛日本土之第一綫。本年七月下句以來，該方而日軍航空戰果，計擊落及繫毀敵機約百二十四架，繫沉及擊毀敵船舶十八艘，破壞軍事股施極多，日方損失飛機約四十架。日軍在中國戰綫之地低落，日方對華施策獲進展後，渝重歸順者其數頓增，日軍將繼　活潑行動，以壓迫渝軍，積極摧毀渝　之鬥志。在滿洲方而，情勢靜　，防護態勢安如磐石。</p>
<p>海相報吿</p>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　日島田海相於二十六日下午在　衆兩院之全體會議發表演說、報告自本年六月十五日起至十月二十日止之海眾戰况，茲聽其大會如次：自大東亞戰爭勃發以不。日陸海兩軍即在西太平洋及印度洋上竭共全力從事戰爭，其後日軍在該方面之優越職略態勢，更趨强化，幷展開勇敢之作戰，於各地擊　敵軍，但敵軍執拗反攻，因此通盤戰局遂進入決戰階段，其　形日趨激烈，日本海軍部隊日陸軍部隊　密合作，於廣大地域努力殲，敵軍，就</p>
<p>印度洋方面</p>
<p>而言，海軍部隊為呼應陸軍部隊，在緬甸之作戰，加强佔領地附近之防備外，復派潛水艇及飛機進攻並擾亂敵軍之後方，遠在非洲東岸担任各重　海城之工作，又十月十二日海軍機隊曾長驅急襲錫蘭島及印度東岸馬都拉斯，炸毀敵卞船舶及軍事設施，復又空襲澳洲西北岸，擊落並擊毀敵機共五十九架，並車創其軍事設施。就北</p>
<p>太平洋方面</p>

<h3>游資流滬</h3>
<p>徒手好閒，無所事事的人們，謂之「游民」：通常亦號為「無樂游民」；在同一意　之下，　忽　定，不事生產的寶金　謂之「游資」。游民是無業的　游資也是　樂的，因為游　是未曾歸到正常小事產事的資金，所以也可　為「　業游日」</p>
<p>上海在未曾厲行經　統制以前。游資之充塞，可以說是一時無兩國；由於游資的無由疏散，其結里遂演成，物價的麼綫上漲，以及　機囤積的猖獗不可收拾。迄於最近，由於當局厲在統制經濟；激底取締投機，一般擁右游資者，遂不得不多方打算、改途易轍，以謀游資之出路，因此、大部份的擁資者，逐漸投資於各種生產事業，小部份的擁資老，逐漸歸納於銀行儲蓄一途，所以今年之十底金融，異常穩定，銀根反較以前為鬆。總之、整個的上海游資，已經打開出路，右如浮雲之散去了。</p>
<p>昨傳天津的大量游資，由於奔避無路，正在南流以至上海，這是我們所不致歡迎的、困為天際浮雲甫經消散的時俠，接上又來一陣，誠恐漸見晴空的經濟上海，　復　　影響，因為游資之充　，猶　河水之泛濫，在我們正在在因勢而利導之」的時侯，自然希望河水的不復繼長增高。</p>

<h3>寗波區棉花　亦統制收買</h3>
<p>預計約十二萬担</p>
<p>今年蘇浙皖三省之棉花，決定概歸商統會棉業部統制收買後，關於浙東區寗波方面之收花事宜。是否亦歸商統會棉業部辦理，頗為各方所關心，蓋去年寗波區所產棉花，並不受舊棉花收買機關之統制也，頃悉今年寗波區域之棉花，因浙　行政巳趨統一，故亦受商統會棉業部之統制收買，一切辦法，均與他區相同，　計今年該方面之棉花之產量，約有十二萬担云。</p>

<h3>廣播協會收費後　應如何調整節目</h3>
<p>中國廣播協會最近會公佈凡京　兩地之無綫電　衆，須與該會盯立收聽契約，並按月繳納收聽費十元，作為廣搖事變之用，想各聽衆均在辦理中，惟鄙人對於目前滅地之廣播，不以下二事，揭請常局加以調整之：</p>
<p>廣告問題本市最一近各電台　播之廣告為數甚多，音人偶一開聽收音機後，即可聆到報告員的滔滔不絕之聲，其時間每有連一節目之大部份者，聞之實令人不感興趣，反覺厭惡。按電台接受廣告，始自戰前各商樂電台，但至大東亞戰後，商業性電台已告絕迹，故目前不應再有此種報告廣告之存在，且此類廣告中，不乏一般國戶出籠之貨物，寳有立即取締之必要，或謂各電台收受廣告因限於經濟，則此　廣　栛會巳收取收聽費，各電台可由廣　協會撥款維持之。</p>
<p>飾目間題大東亞戰事發生後，本市以華語為主之電台，僅上海電台家，此外如德國，法國，蘇　呼聲，東亞等電台，皆以外語為主，問有一二節華語飾目，但祗是報告新聞及敎授外語居多，故國人可以聽者僅一家而已，似乎太少，再就節目內容而言，固然有不少交　，敎養，等飾目，然鋇東方面獨多申曲，越劇，滑稽一額低級性節日，開之不免觉得太粗组也，故畢語　節目有詞整　之必要　雷狄</p>
<h3>聞市校敎職員願有感</h3>
<p>— 不平</p>
<p>上海市各私立学校按補助費，　發放有期了，在　一點上，很可看出政府確能　念　職員生活淸苦。力謀安定敎　員生活苦。力謀安定敎職員生活，藉求教育工作效　之糧高，這是使任何人看了都感覺到萬分興絮的。但頃閱報戰，七十二個市立學校的放戰員，卻因所入（每月二百二十元）不足維持個人生活，（每日祇夠購七個大餅願，要求在底薪三十元之上，增加八百元。這一個要求，衛以目前的物價，再此諸事卿前三十元（事實上南北市的教職員均在五十元以上）一月的薪水標準，還是個極低的數目？試想，在事變前，即以三十元的月薪而論，除去五六元之膳費外，尙餘二十五六元之諾，以之事父母，蓄妻孥，是足可過那濟茶淡飯的生活的。現在，即使市府願念敎職員生活清苦，「準如所請」，不過可以維持一夫一妻的小家庭生活罷了。（這是就目前的物價而言，過了一二月後，物價如有增高，這怕區區八百多元之數，連一夫一妻的生活又難維持？，）如果有父母子女　話，勢必舉價度日哩，安定」二字，恐　歸　到呢！</p>
<p>筆者　於敎育工作的不要，同　於小學敎師生活的濟苦，（不，是不夠　個人的肚　不，忍緘默一，特代呼　，希望政府　這批」民族的保姆」，給千最低限度的生活物資（如事變前足　持五六口人膳費的代價），同時更希望一般子女在求學中的家長，為着自己子女的前途，合力來想法濟助敎師，使一敎師安心執敎，自己的子一女拼安心就學，民族前途幸甚，國家前　幸甚！學校不應忽視</p>
<p>學校不應忽視防空求新</p>
<p>整個上海的市民，在一富局和保甲辦事處督促和指導之下，對於防空設備都相當注意，而准照當局　指示者奉行。然而使我一們表示驚奇的。目前上海有甚多學校，對此問題，一却漠不注意。我們定得進一去，看到有的學校，玻璃窗不用紙貼。沙泥，水缸也一些看不到，會想到難這敎育界人，反比其他各界為漠視防空設備嗎？學校為文化機關之一，尤　是讀　的兒童，全是新中國未來的主人翁，家長旣以兒女託付學校，寄以莫大的期望，學校自應負起在校時期。盡力防題學生之貴？庶可放於萬一，而副家長託付之望。否則如有空襲，學校裹面，設備全無，學生的驚惶失措，乃至玻璃震壞，傷及兒童，着火燃燒等事，容或有之。到丁此時，又將如何應付？身為校長及負有責任者，豈可漠然視之，不在心上！</p>
<h3>電車廢票　改作獎券的建議</h3>
<p>— 袁騮先</p>
<p>售票員揩油，直接減少公司收入，間接增加市民負擔，公司當局雖三番五次，籲請市民合作，然終難收效果，考其原因，乃一般趁客皆寬大為懷，只　査票不來，票子之有無，票價之符合與否，持不利己，為國人所深忌者一，甚或於下車時遭售票的一暗算，更不値得。余意有　，即由公司當局獎勵趁　蒐集車票，每月抽　給　者給予票　百倍之代佰將此法之優點略述於後：</p>
<p>趁客執有車票，有中獎之機會，絕不肯付　而不取票。或於下車時將發票交予售票員。再給旁人。　照票價百倍給獎，趁客絕不肯收票價不符之車票。　憑代價券購月季票，公司不必另加支出，然若直接發給月季票，則無第二條之優點。　發票散佈馬路頗不雅觀，設　票票箱或雇人清除，皆須開支，如此則可節省。　趁　自己揩油者亦可減少</p>

<p>他又告訴我兜售花結最好的方法，他說：當他找尋目的物而獲得時，他就趕去揀一朵最適宜於該人身份的花結去別在這位先生的身上，「先生，請你捐買一朵助學結好嗎？我們是靑年會少年部聯靑團佩章－一面指着身上所佩的團章！為申新兩報　　貸學金義賣的助學結，這種結滴於男女衣髮兩用，其實用不着我說完，他就會掏錢問價的，這樣我就完成了使命。」</p>

        <h1>1943.10.27</h1>
<h3>Promotion of Postal Transport</h3>
<p>In the current decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, striving for victory is of paramount importance. According to current trends, while the foundation for victory has been laid, its final completion still requires efforts from all sides. Modern warfare is called total war, and the so-called "total strength" includes all forces directly and indirectly related to the war. Military affairs are certainly important, but politics and economics are equally important. Since we are a participating nation, we must each exert our maximum effort within all sectors of the total strength scope to create a powerful overall strength and achieve victory.</p>
<p>Traffic and transportation bear the responsibility for the flow of human and material resources, and everyone knows the urgency and scope of their need in wartime. The strength or weakness of transportation capacity is one of the main factors determining the outcome of the war, which need not be reiterated. Therefore, as we cooperate with our ally Japan in striving for final victory, strengthening transportation capacity is undoubtedly a pressing matter of immediate concern.</p>
<p>Secondly, from the perspective of people's livelihood and economy, the circulation of materials and the adjustment of supply and demand also depend on the smooth flow of transportation. Therefore, those who discuss the problem of commodity prices list transportation obstruction as one of the main factors for rising prices. If we hope for commodity prices to fall back, we must find ways to clear transportation bottlenecks. From the perspective of solving people's livelihood problems, increasing transportation capacity is also a matter of immediate concern.</p>
<p>In theory, increasing transportation capacity is a matter of utmost urgency. However, in reality, there are of course many difficulties. The main one is the lack of gasoline, which prevents highway automobiles and shipping vessels from operating smoothly due to fuel problems. Secondly, there is a shortage of automobiles, ships, and parts. Our heavy industry and vehicle and shipbuilding industries are extremely backward. In the past, we relied heavily on foreign countries. Since foreign shipping has been suspended and sources have been cut off, domestic production has not been able to keep up. Therefore, the lack of modern transportation tools is extremely pitiful. At the same time, obtaining fuel is even more difficult. Therefore, the current transportation capacity is not only unable to increase compared to before, but may even decrease further, which is an extremely serious problem.</p>
<p>However, since the transportation problem is extremely important, we must find ways to remedy it in terms of the situation. Therefore, we propose a postal transport method as an aid to solving transportation problems in today's environment. The postal transport system has a long history, originating in the Zhou Dynasty and reaching its full development in the Yuan Dynasty. It became even more comprehensive during the Qing Dynasty. However, the postal stations of past dynasties were only limited to delivering official documents, which is not entirely the same as the meaning of transportation. And everything from the organization and management of postal stations, funding, and itineraries, etc., is sufficient for historical reference. How to imitate the ancient postal station system, using human and animal power, adapting to local conditions, setting up stations at regular intervals, with stations relaying to each other, in order to enhance transportation capacity, should be the first thing to research and plan.</p>
<p>The unit of postal transport is smaller, and the time for delivery is longer. Its effectiveness cannot be compared with modern transportation tools. But the essence of transportation does not lie entirely in speed at one time and place, but also in its constant and continuous source. Therefore, transportation with sustained power, regardless of the tools used, is the main transportation. The spirit and value of postal transport lie in its lasting and continuous flow. However, postal transport operations are complex and cumbersome, and take motive power as the main factor. Obtaining motive power and sources, especially using carriers as the backbone, means the advance of postal transport really takes scientific management and mobilizing the masses as a prerequisite. Only through scientific methods and rational management can we handle complexity with simplicity; only by mobilizing the masses and launching human power can we achieve practical results.</p>
<p>Feeling the importance of the transportation problem, and considering the actual environment, we propose the postal transport method, and earnestly hope that the government authorities and all sectors of society will pay attention to it. How to plan and how to promote it will be discussed further in future articles.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Provisional Parliament Opens; The Emperor Bestows a Gracious Rescript, Hoping that the Hundred Million Will Be of One Mind to Achieve the Goal of Victory</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - The opening ceremony of the 83rd Provisional Imperial Diet was solemnly held at the House of Peers in the presence of His Majesty the Emperor on the 26th. His Majesty the Emperor, wearing an army uniform and adorning medals, accompanied by Chief Aide-de-Camp Hyakutake and Grand Chamberlain Matsudaira, departed the Imperial Palace at 10:45 a.m. and arrived at the venue at 11:00 a.m. The Diet members offered their deepest respects, and His Majesty the Emperor bestowed a gracious rescript. The opening ceremony concluded, and His Majesty the Emperor returned to the Imperial Palace at 11:15 a.m.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - The Emperor's rescript at the opening ceremony of the Diet is as follows: We hereby hold the opening ceremony of the Imperial Diet and inform the members of both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives that our expeditionary forces have overcome all difficulties, fought bravely everywhere, displayed military prowess, and the construction of Greater East Asia is progressing day by day, and our alliances with friendly nations are becoming increasingly consolidated, for which We are deeply gratified. The current situation is still critical. The hundred million people should be of one mind, exert their total strength to defeat the enemy's wild ambitions. We trust in the loyalty and bravery of our subjects, and hope for the speedy achievement of the war aims. We order the Ministers of State to submit to the Imperial Diet emergency supplementary budget proposals and legislative bills related to the current situation, and hope that you will understand Our intentions, deliberate harmoniously, and assist Us in governance.</p>
<h3>At the 83rd Session of the Diet; The Prime Minister Delivers a Policy Speech; Fully Performing the Grave Responsibility of the Decisive Battle</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Tojo's policy speech at the 83rd Provisional Imperial Diet is as follows: At this opening ceremony, I am deeply honored and grateful for the gracious rescript bestowed by His Majesty. I hereby deeply hope to share the Imperial will with you all, to exert our full strength to carry out the grave responsibilities under the decisive battle, so as to achieve the war goals at an early date, and ease the Emperor’s mind. It has been almost two years since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Under the Imperial power, the soldiers of the Imperial Army have overcome all kinds of hardships and crushed the stubborn counterattacks of the enemy, and the results of the war have continued to expand. I and you should sincerely thank the officers and men of the Imperial Army for their good planning and fighting, and for their great merits and hard work. At the same time, on this occasion, I would like to express my deepest condolences to the heroic soldiers who died in the line of duty, and I hope that the wounded soldiers will recover soon and rise again to serve the country. I also express my heartfelt sympathy to the families of the fallen. On the other hand, it is also reminiscent of the firearms and the ordinary citizens, who constantly send their brothers to the front line, and concentrate on enhancing their combat power, so that the soldiers at the front do not have to worry about the rear, and can give full play to their combat power. I and you express our deepest gratitude for the continuous contributions and hard work of the citizens.</p>
<p>Abundant Combat Power</p>
<p>Looking at the current war situation as a whole, since the humiliating defeat of the British and American forces, the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia have become more and more united, with the Empire as the center. The combat power of the Empire, with its abundant resource treasures, has been rapidly enriched. The enemy, Britain and America, shocked by this fact, have decided to carry out a major counterattack against the Empire in an attempt to defeat the Empire. As a result, the enemy, Britain and America, took all risks and spared no means to launch a counterattack, so the fighting became increasingly fierce. At this time, when they dare to launch a fierce attack, the Empire is also determined to launch a fierce attack on them, destroy the enemy's combat power, and ensure victory. At this critical moment, the only responsibility that our citizens should fulfill is to rapidly increase our strength, quickly make preparations, and be able to destroy the combat power of Britain and America so as to respond to the needs of the front line. However, this responsibility is by no means easy. What we thought and did before will not achieve anything. All citizens must truly eliminate all inertia, eliminate all obstacles, and devote all their efforts to achieve success. Moreover, the evolution of the war situation does not allow us to hesitate for a moment. The reason why the government previously formulated the "Essential Guidelines for Implementing National Policy Under the Current Situation" is precisely for this purpose. The reason for requesting the convening of the Diet this time and for praying for the deliberation of various emergency bills related to the current situation is also for this purpose. The purpose of the government's plan to reform the implementation of national policy this time is to make the relationship between the command and the state affairs closer, and to promote a lively war guidance policy, implement flexible diplomatic policies, cooperate to complete the war, and strengthen various domestic attitudes. The goal of strengthening the domestic situation is to rapidly increase military production with indomitable determination, and strive to expand air combat power, taking this as the center, and thoroughly strengthen the Empire’s support situation. Today, when all 100 million citizens of our country are engaged in combat deployment, and the officials and the people are of one mind to concentrate their total strength on the great war with a new spirit, the government, under this belief, is determined not to stick to the past traditions, eliminate all obstacles, and implement the necessary policies.</p>
<p>Strengthening Internal Defense</p>
<p>Regarding the specific policies for strengthening the domestic situation, there have been repeated statements, the important ones being the decisive transformation of administration, the expansion of the number of national officials, and the strengthening of the domestic defense situation. The government should adopt comprehensive measures to inspire the people and unify the national strength so as to realize these policies. Based on the above purpose, the government has rapidly begun to implement policies to strengthen the domestic situation. Regarding the policy of decisive transformation of administration, the government has first decided to establish the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, the Ministry of Military Supplies, and the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, and to improve the administrative structure, greatly reduce the number of civil servants, and to reform government affairs so as to simplify the budget thoroughly. As for the expansion of national mobilization, it will be implemented as soon as possible. Measures such as suspending the general conscription deferment for students, expanding the scope of conscription, and making it universal have been taken, and strategic and extraordinary measures regarding education have also been decided. Regarding the strengthening of the domestic defense situation, in order to unify the domestic defense policies, a General Headquarters for Air Defense will be established, and policies such as dispersing the population and facilities have been decided. I believe that whether the strengthening of the domestic situation can be implemented quickly and thoroughly will also determine the success or failure of the Greater East Asia War. The government, in view of this, will approach the implementation of the matters that have been decided and the many matters that should be started with a firm and continuous attitude, so as to achieve results and satisfy the demands of the operation. In this unprecedentedly important war situation, the government earnestly hopes that the citizens will wholeheartedly cooperate, and that the Empire will rise up to eliminate all obstacles for the sake of self-preservation and self-defense. I believe that this significant war will inevitably be won by us. Looking back at the operations since the beginning of the war, observing the current situation in Greater East Asia, and the general trend of the offensive and defensive battles between us, our belief in victory is becoming more and more firm. Moreover, our 100 million officials and people are all engaged in combat deployment in the current stage of the war, which is a turning point. Concentrating all our strength on destroying Britain and the United States for His Majesty the Emperor, the only future for us is victory.</p>
<p>European Situation</p>
<p>Looking at the situation in Europe, the shameless betrayal of the Italian Badoglio faction is deeply regrettable to us. However, their actions only plunged the Italian people into a dead end, suffering the misfortune of charcoal, and the Axis powers' inevitable victory situation has not been shaken. Moreover, thanks to the swift and appropriate measures taken by Führer Hitler, Commander Mussolini was able to make a comeback, unite his patriotic comrades, and establish a republican government to work with Japan and Germany to eliminate Britain and the United States. The governments of Japan and Germany have immediately recognized the new republican government, so I would like to express my heartfelt congratulations on the Commander's comeback and wish them courage to fight in the future. Today, Germany, in order to respond to the new situation in the European theater, has made thorough preparations for coping strategies under the unified determination of the whole country, implemented large-scale national mobilization, and established a stable system in Europe, and is preparing for new combat plans. The Empire is confident that its ally Germany will reap the expected results in this new operation, and that the day when it joins hands with the Empire to subdue Britain and the United States is near. In addition, looking at the East Asian situation, the great cause of liberating the countries and ethnic groups of Greater East Asia, which have been devastated by Britain's ambition for many years, and freeing them from their cruel shackles, has built a solid foundation with firm steps. The independence of Burma before and the independence of the Philippines now can be seen as examples. Based on international integrity, the Empire will ensure that all its agreements are fulfilled. This is a true expression of the great ideals of national founding in the year 8, and is also the Empire's basic philosophy. Now, in Manchuria, the people are united from top to bottom, their friendship with the Empire is growing stronger, and they are cooperating with the Empire in terms of both material and spiritual resources. Here, the Empire expresses its deep gratitude for its cooperation, and at the same time hopes for its limitless development in the future.</p>
<h3>Revision of the Sino-Japanese Treaty to be Embodied; Agreement Reached on Pursuing the War</h3>
<p>Regarding the Republic of China, since the beginning of this year, the Empire has actively proceeded with the concrete implementation of returning concessions, as well as a number of cases, in accordance with its established policy, which is already a well-known fact. Moreover, regarding the revision of the Sino-Japanese Treaty, it will soon be embodied. When Chairman Wang of the National Government visited Japan earlier, he had talks with me. We exchanged views on the path for China and Japan to jointly pursue the war, and we reached a complete agreement. I express my heartfelt respect for his ambition to achieve "China for the Chinese" and his spirit to advance for the liberation of one billion people in Greater East Asia. At this time, the Chongqing side is still engaged in fratricidal strife, unable to participate in the great plan of China's rebirth, and unable to jointly engage in the common cause of the Greater East Asian nations, which is truly regrettable. However, I have deep sympathy for the people under the rule of the Chongqing side.</p>
<p>Regarding Thailand</p>
<p>The four northern states of Malaya and the two states of Shan have been incorporated into Thai territory. Now, the relationship between Japan and Thailand is becoming more and more solid. The Empire is deeply grateful for Thailand's cooperation. At the same time, the Empire sincerely wishes to provide full cooperation for the prosperity of Thailand. Regarding Burma, that country declared its independence on August 1. Burma has been groaning under the persecution of Britain for more than a day. However, when the Greater East Asia War broke out, Burma resolutely rose up and placed its full cooperation on the Empire. Now, the long-cherished wish of the Burmese people has finally been achieved, and their independence has finally been realized. Here, I and you all regard the independence of Burma and its future development with new eyes, and at the same time, we earnestly hope that it will continue to cooperate with the Empire on the front line of the Greater East Asian defense. The Empire will also spare no effort to assist in the prosperity of Burma. On October 14, we have witnessed the</p>
<p>Independence of the Philippines</p>
<p>Republic. Now, the Philippines has broken away from the rule of different ethnic groups for 400 years, and has been liberated from the deception and oppression of the United States in the last 40 years. The 8 million people of the Philippine Islands are now, under the leadership of President Laurel, building a "Philippines for the Filipinos" and cooperating with the Empire to complete the Greater East Asia War. The Empire, based on morality and Greater East Asia, in addition to hoping for the rights of the Philippine people to be developed, is willing to provide all cooperation to complete their cause.</p>
<p>Looking at India</p>
<p>The 400 million people are still groaning under British oppression. In addition, the United States has recently extended its aggressive hand to India. The suffering of the Indian people is indescribable. Due to the tyrannical rule of Britain and the United States and the atrocities of the British and American troops, the conflict between them and the Indian people has become more and more intensified, causing profound social chaos. India has finally fallen into an unprecedented famine. This tragedy is getting worse and worse. Britain and the United States also acknowledge this. Indian patriots have all been arrested and imprisoned by the British authorities, and ordinary innocent people are sitting and waiting to die. This is a world tragedy and a public outrage to mankind, which we cannot stand by and watch. This autumn, Indian patriots, including Subhas Chandra Bose, have risen up for the liberation of their country. On October 21 of this year, they established a provisional government of India. The Empire has stated on the 23rd that it will recognize the government. From now on, the Empire will always support the government with a cooperative attitude to complete independence and liberation. This determination. It is my pleasure to announce this decision publicly through this Diet. The Empire's heartfelt hope is for the complete independence and freedom of India, and the eternal prosperity of its 400 million people. The Empire's goal is to obtain the sincere cooperation of all the nations of Greater East Asia. I believe that this can win the approval of people around the world. At the same time, India's liberation movement and the cooperation of the Greater East Asian nations will surely enable India to achieve independence, freedom and prosperity. The above is an explanation of the government's beliefs in this important situation. I hope you will understand the government's determination and give your heartfelt cooperation. Regarding the budget bill and the legal bill submitted by the government this time, I hope you will deliberate on them and give your support.</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles Between German and Soviet Troops to Seize the Gateway to Crimea; German Troops Withdraw from Important Industrial City in Ukraine</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - In order to break through the Dnieper River defense line before winter, Soviet troops have launched a decisive battle with German troops in the Dnieper River estuary and near Melitopol in recent days. The outcome of the Dnieper River battle will be determined by this battle.</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency reports: The battle for the Greater Dnieper River estuary and the gateway to Crimea entered a new stage at the end of last week. Soviet troops once again used elite troops to attempt to break into Kryvyi Rih between Kryvyi Rih and Dnipropetrovsk, and increased pressure on both sides. They have crossed the Dnieper River and established a new bridgehead in Dnipropetrovsk, but the focus of the battle is still in Kryvyi Rih. The enemy is attacking with heavy troops, and our army is counterattacking. The German army's position on the Nogai steppe is still the target of the Soviet army's fierce attacks. They are constantly attacking the German army's position southeast of Chaplynka, attempting to break into Nikopol along the lower reaches of the Dnieper River. However, the enemy's attacks between Chaplynka and the Sea of Azov on the 23rd and 24th were severely damaged and repelled by our army. The fighting in the Kiev area has gradually eased. Soviet troops attacked the Smolensk-Minsk highway, attempting to break into Orsha, but failed because the German defense line was strong.</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to military authorities here, in order to implement the German High Command's plan to shorten the front line, German troops have carried out a planned withdrawal from Dnipropetrovsk (southeast of Kremenchuk) on Monday. During the withdrawal, German troops did not engage in fierce fighting with the enemy. The withdrawing troops were very orderly and had already transported all military supplies and heavy equipment to the new position. The rear troops had been preparing for the withdrawal in the dazzling city long ago. Even if the enemy occupies it, it will not be able to find its military value.</p>
<p>German Military Report</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - The German Führer's report on the battlefield states that the fighting in the Melitopol area and southeast of Chaplynka in the southern sector of the front line has developed to a particularly fierce degree yesterday. Soviet troops have repeatedly launched attacks and been defeated. The German army has leveled the sunken areas of the position. The fighting in the Dnieper River estuary is still ongoing. The German army has withdrawn from Dnipropetrovsk. Soviet troops have again attacked Kryvyi Rih (southwest of Dnipro) with new troops. There have been fierce battles north of the city for several days, and yesterday was no exception. The German army attacked the enemy from the northeast, greatly reducing the enemy's pressure on the front. The Soviet side launched an offensive from the bridgehead northwest of Kremenchuk with powerful forces, and was repelled in the counterattack. Fierce local battles have occurred north and southeast of Chaplynka and north of Chervonokonsky. Soviet troops were all repelled. Four Soviet rifle divisions attacked a key line of defense near Kryvyi Rih. The German army launched a fierce counterattack, adjusting several places where the enemy had broken through the defense line, and finally drove the enemy back to their original position. There were no fierce battles west of Smolensk and south of Velikiye Luki. The Luftwaffe cooperated with German aircraft in the battle and cooperated well with the ground troops. From the 22nd to the 25th, the Soviet army lost a total of 188 aircraft, while the German army lost only 14.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles Underway on the Upper Reaches of the Dnieper River</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports that German infantry, under the cover of heavy artillery and mechanized anti-aircraft guns, has successfully completed its military operation against the Soviet army's outer troops south of Gomel. The situation in that area is special and difficult to reconnoiter, but the German army, despite all difficulties, finally cut off the Soviet army's connection with the rear on Sunday and encircled it in the narrowest area. The Soviet High Command tried to rescue the besieged Soviet troops from the outside, but was blocked by the German army's resolute resistance. The defensive battles on both sides of the Smolensk-Orsha highway are still ongoing. The fighting north of the highway is particularly fierce. Although the Soviet army's offensive is fierce, all German defense lines are being firmly held. A few local gaps have been filled immediately after the German army's immediate counterattack. Generally speaking, the German army has achieved a decisive and significant victory west of Smolensk.</p>
<h3>Soviet Reserve Troops Concentrated on Four Focal Points</h3>
<p>At the same time, the Soviet army has concentrated all its available reserve troops on four focal points. A few days ago, the Soviet army was still trying to attack in all directions in order to find a weak point in the German army's forces. Now, it has increased the mobilization of reserve troops and gathered them at the following four major strongholds: between the Sea of Azov and the Dnieper River estuary; northwest of Dnipropetrovsk; south of Gomel; and along the Smolensk-Orsha highway. Fierce battles were still taking place at each of these strongholds on Sunday. Although the Red Army attacked with large tank groups, artillery units, and other heavy artillery, it failed to break through the German defense lines at any point or penetrate deep into the German positions. Several groups of enemy tanks broke through gaps in the German defense lines, but were immediately intercepted and annihilated by German reserve troops. In the southern part of the eastern front, north of Kryvyi Rih, German tank units launched a fierce counterattack and captured no less than 62 enemy tanks.</p>
<h3>Under Cover of Dense Fog, Attempt to Cross the River</h3>
<p>The Soviet army, with four infantry divisions and two tank brigades, attacked on both sides of Melitopol. The fierce battle lasted for several hours, resulting in the destruction of 30 enemy tanks. In the late evening, the Soviet army suddenly broke through a point in the German line, forcing the Germans to retreat several kilometers. The fierce battle continued all night, and the fighting was still ongoing on Sunday morning. Under the cover of heavy fog, the Soviet army established two small bridgeheads on both sides of Dnipropetrovsk, but these bridgeheads were not significant. North of Kryvyi Rih, the German defense line was heavily attacked by the Soviet army, but all enemy advances were repelled. The Soviet army lost 35 tanks in that area. When the German tank force launched a counterattack, it cut off a Soviet tank group and captured 62 enemy tanks. On Sunday, the Soviet army lost a total of 197 tanks, and casualties were also considerable.</p>

<h3>German Troops on the North Bank of the Volturno River Hold Advantageous Positions; Fierce Artillery Fire Repels Offensives</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to the German News Agency, in the past few days of combat operations in southern Italy, German forces have achieved defensive victories against numerically superior British and American forces at three strongpoints in the Campania Plain and the Apennines, while also implementing their planned strategy of shortening their lines. The methods employed by the German rearguard have proven extremely effective, not only blocking British and American advances but also repelling them in powerful counterattacks. On Sunday, enemy forces lost 14 tanks and eight reconnaissance tanks in these combat operations, in addition to significant losses in other equipment and manpower. The German defensive victory was so great that the American forces did not pursue the German forces when they dispersed from the aforementioned strongpoints. According to reports from the battlefield in that area, the German forces north of the Volturno River have moved into extremely advantageous positions in the mountains near Sparanise. This natural barrier allows the German forces to defend themselves easily, and repeated American and British attacks have been unsuccessful, instead resulting in the loss of one Churchill tank, nine tanks, and three armored reconnaissance vehicles. On Sunday afternoon, two German assault teams composed of grenadiers and anti-aircraft gunners launched a surprise attack from the side, repelling American reinforcement teams and infiltrating behind several British and American units. As a result, the British and American forces urgently retreated south. Along the upper reaches of the Volturno River, the artillery of the German rearguard attacked and dispersed approaching American columns, inflicting extremely heavy losses on the American forces. The remaining American forces at the German front line were finally cleared by the assault teams. In the area of Baranello, near Colledanchise, German rearguard units and British and Canadian assault teams fought fiercely. The enemy attempted to reach the highway from Foggia to Rome but failed and instead launched a flanking attack. However, as they entered the range of the German artillery, they were subjected to a barrage of artillery fire, and the enemy's attempt collapsed. An attempt by Canadian tanks and reconnaissance tanks to provide relief resulted in the destruction of five Churchill tanks and two reconnaissance tanks. Canadian reinforcements were repelled in a German counterattack, resulting in the destruction of two more Churchill tanks and one reconnaissance tank. In the evening, the enemy dragged their dead and wounded soldiers away from the battlefield, while the German rearguard followed behind the main German force without being hindered by the enemy. The British Eighth Army is still continuing to reorganize its units. A British sapper team launched a fierce attack on a bridge on the Trigno River but was repelled before reaching the bridge. A batch of prisoners of war fell into German hands.</p>
<p>Mountains as Barriers, 2,000 Feet Above Sea Level</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to the Huitong News Agency, German forces have gained an advantage in operations in the mountainous areas of southern Italy. Although the enemy is superior in manpower and materiel, their combat operations have been hindered. Even the deployment of Scottish and Canadian troops to fight in the mountains has not been effective, so the enemy made no progress last week, and their limited advances have no strategic significance. The American troops advancing towards the northern mountain pass of Capua were severely damaged and repulsed by a German counterattack on the 23rd. Part of the American Fifth Army stationed near Rocchetta a Volturno and Sparanise also had no special activities. The positions held by the German forces on Mount Matese, 2,000 meters above sea level, not only prevented the enemy's advance but also controlled the routes to Venafro, Contapullo, and Isernia, which were repeatedly attacked by the left flank of the British Eighth Army. On the 23rd, the German forces launched a surprise attack on the enemy's rearguard a few kilometers southwest of Venafro, near Campochiaro, and the British forces collapsed in panic. On the Campobasso front, the enemy also switched to the defensive. The right flank of the British Eighth Army made some progress in Biferno and Trigno but did not cross the line of Ruscito Montenero. Their vanguard advancing towards Trigno has encountered strong resistance from our army.</p>
<p>Difficult to Cross Minefields on the Highway to Rome</p>
<p>Stockholm, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch) - At the beginning of the Allied landing in Italy, there was a tendency to quickly sweep across all of Italy. However, encountering fierce resistance from the German forces, their progress was not as fast as expected, and now they are stalled in a stalemate. A recent dispatch from Algiers stated that Deputy Commander-in-Chief Alexander of the Allied forces in North Africa, when meeting with reporters on the 24th, spoke about the future difficulties of the Italian campaign, saying that there was no significant progress in the Italian campaign because the German counterattacks had been strengthened and powerful reinforcements had been sent. Future battles will be even more difficult. The first objective of the Allied forces is to occupy Rome. The saying "All roads lead to Rome" is almost a lie because almost all roads to Rome are covered with mines to prevent the Allied advance. To date, the Allied losses in the Italian campaign are approximately 14,000 men, including 8,000 British and 6,000 American, it is said.</p>
<h3>Germany Adopts Military and Political Measures to Pacify the Balkans, Enabling Small Countries to Adapt to Its Interests</h3>

<h3>Italy to Hold Grand Celebration of the March on Rome; Mussolini to Deliver a Speech</h3>

A grand ceremony will be held in Rome on this great day. Fascist Party members will hold their first congress in Milan on that day.</p>

<h3>Czech Foreign Minister Issues an Appeal</h3>

<h3>Unrest in Portugal</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to Huitong News Agency reporter Coester, the lives of Portuguese people are no longer as stable as before, and Portugal is close to war. People who left Portugal a few months ago will have an even stronger impression if they return today. Most notable are the blackout regulations, with train windows painted with gray-black lines. Portuguese newspapers frequently discuss bread rationing, food control, and air raid drills, all of which cause psychological stress among the people. Outside Lisbon, barrage balloons are suspended in the air, and windows in the city are covered with black paper. Air raid drills are frequently held, medical sirens wail, and ambulances are constantly on the move. Some Portuguese friends asked me about the threats of famine blockade imposed on Portugal by Britain and the United States, which is why imports to the country have sharply declined in recent months. What interests me most is that this pro-British country does not agree with the occupation of the Azores. People openly oppose it in restaurants and bars, but they also understand the government's difficulties. I feel that the Portuguese people take the air raid drills and other precautions very seriously. The Azores incident has made the public aware of the need to train for war.</p>

<h3>War Situation of the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Report by the Minister of the Army</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Minister of the Army, Tojo, reported on the war situation at the plenary session of both houses of the Diet on the 26th. The contents are as follows: At the previous Diet session, I reported on the war situation. Now, I will report on the general progress of the war since then. (First)</p>
<p>Northeastern Front</p>
<p>Regarding the battle of Attu Island, I have repeatedly explained in detail in the Diet. The garrison of Kiska Island, without realizing it, continued to bomb and shell the uninhabited Kiska Island about two hundred times. They finally landed there on August 15th. Subsequently, enemy aircraft attacked the northern Kuril Islands again. According to the headquarters' announcement, the number of enemy aircraft that attacked was about thirty in total. Half of them have been shot down by the Japanese army, and at least one-third of the remaining ones were damaged. (Second)</p>
<p>New Guinea</p>
<p>Solomon Islands and New Guinea: Since this spring, a unit of the Japanese army in the New Guinea area has been confronting superior enemy forces in the southern region of Salamaua. On June 30th, part of the enemy army landed east of Salamaua, and on September 4th and 22nd, a strong enemy force landed in Lae and Finschhafen. The Japanese army and air force units in that area are cooperating to attack them. The Japanese ground forces are also acting in unison and are currently attacking the enemy forces in the Finschhafen area, engaging in fierce battles. Furthermore, the Japanese troops fighting near Salamaua and Lae inflicted heavy damage on the enemy and gathered in the northern area of Lae in mid-September. Also, since early October, the Japanese army units in the southern area of Munda have been engaging with enemy forces that have advanced to the right bank of the upper reaches of the Ramu River. The enemy's air power in that area is estimated to have about 1,200 aircraft on the front line and about 1,800 aircraft in the rear. The enemy's tactics involve using superior air power as a vanguard, advancing steadily and methodically. The Japanese army and navy air forces, in close cooperation, either sortie to attack enemy air bases far away or directly cooperate with the ground forces in combat, protecting the Japanese base areas and transport convoys. According to statistics, the recent results of the Japanese air battles show that for every three Japanese aircraft sacrificed, the enemy lost several times that number in aircraft shot down or destroyed. The outstanding combat skills and fighting spirit of the Japanese air force soldiers have consistently achieved remarkable results in local battles. The Japanese ground forces are also unyielding, fully demonstrating the Japanese army's fighting spirit. Since June, the Japanese army in the New Guinea area has inflicted the following damage on the enemy: 500 enemy aircraft shot down or destroyed, 18 enemy transport ships sunk or destroyed, approximately 40 transport ships, and over 50 boats. In ground battles, the enemy's casualties have exceeded at least 14,000. The Japanese army has captured a large number of artillery and military equipment. Combining the statements of prisoners and other intelligence, the enemy's damage is particularly high in terms of manpower consumption. (Third) Southern and</p>
<p>Burma Fronts</p>
<p>The air combat there has gradually intensified. Since June of this year, the number of enemy aircraft attacking each month has reached about 1,000, and in September, it increased to 1,600. Fierce battles have continued throughout. The enemy's air strength in that area is estimated to have about 1,000 aircraft on the front line. The Japanese army air force is currently responsible for air defense in a wide range of areas, including Burma, Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaya. They are also conducting patrol missions throughout the Bay of Bengal, Sumatra, and the southern sea of Java, and are preparing to attack northwestern Australia at an opportune moment. Furthermore, the Japanese army on the Yunnan-Burma border suddenly launched an attack in mid-October, catching the Chongqing army by surprise. They surrounded a strong unit of the Chongqing army in the upper reaches of the Nu River, inflicting heavy damage on the Yunnan direct-line army. Battles are continuing. The enemy has repeatedly called for a counterattack on Burma, and their actions are gradually becoming more heated. The Japanese army has strengthened its rear defense posture, preparing to launch the next phase of operations. (Fourth)</p>
<p>China and Manchuria</p>
<p>Regarding the situation in the Chongqing area, it is estimated that the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing has a total of about 300 to 400 American aircraft, including long-range bombers. They are currently attempting to attack the Japanese mainland. Since July of this year, the Japanese Air Force has successively attacked the U.S. Air Force bases in Chongqing, Hengyang, Lingling, Jian'ou, Baoqing, Guilin, Kunming, and other places, inflicting heavy damage and thwarting their counterattack attempts, thereby consolidating the first line of defense for the Japanese mainland. Since the latter part of July of this year, the Japanese air force in that area has achieved the following results: approximately 124 enemy aircraft shot down and destroyed, 18 enemy ships sunk and destroyed, and extensive damage to military facilities. The Japanese side lost approximately 40 aircraft. The Japanese army's situation on the China front has improved. As Japanese policies toward China have progressed, the number of Chongqing defectors has increased sharply. The Japanese army will continue to take vigorous action to suppress the Chongqing army and actively destroy their fighting spirit. In Manchuria, the situation is quiet, and the defensive posture is as solid as a rock.</p>
<p>Report by the Minister of the Navy</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) - On the afternoon of the 26th, the Minister of the Navy, Shimada, delivered a speech at the plenary session of both houses of the Diet, reporting on the naval war situation from June 15th to October 20th of this year. The gist of his report is as follows: Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army and navy have exerted their full strength in the West Pacific and Indian Oceans. Subsequently, the Japanese army's superior strategic posture in those areas has been further strengthened, and brave operations have been launched, defeating the enemy in various places. However, the enemy has stubbornly counterattacked, and as a result, the overall war situation has entered a decisive phase, and its form is becoming increasingly intense. The Japanese naval forces are cooperating closely with the army to annihilate the enemy in a wide area.</p>
<p>Regarding the Indian Ocean</p>
<p>In order to support the army's operations in Burma, the naval forces have strengthened the defense of the occupied areas and dispatched submarines and aircraft to attack and disrupt the enemy's rear. They have also undertaken the work of various important naval ports far on the east coast of Africa. Furthermore, on October 12th, naval air units launched a long-range surprise attack on Ceylon and Madras on the east coast of India, bombing enemy ships and military facilities. They also raided the northwest coast of Australia, shooting down and destroying a total of 59 enemy aircraft and damaging their military facilities. Regarding the North</p>
<p>Pacific</p>
<p>There was a heroic battle on Attu Island. Subsequently, in late July, the Kiska Island unit skillfully withdrew, without being hindered in any way by the enemy, and retreated to a new position. On September 12th, enemy aircraft attacked the northern Kuril Islands. The Japanese air units immediately scrambled to intercept them, shooting down most of them. Then, on October 14th, Japanese air units launched a surprise attack on Attu Island, bombing enemy military facilities. Thus, in the naval and air battles in the northern defense of Japan, the Japanese naval air force landed on New Georgia Island. The Japanese army and naval landing forces immediately welcomed and studied them, fighting fiercely in various places under the heavy bombing of numerous enemy aircraft, destroying enemy air bases by air strikes, and bombing their ships and landing points, suppressing the enemy air force units. In addition, they also heavily bombed the enemy's rear areas of Vanikoro Island, Funafuti Island, and Canton Island, where the enemy supplies were located. Also during this period, the Japanese water surface combat team repeatedly and forcefully attacked the enemy's southern naval forces in the sea near that area. In summary, in the</p>
<p>Kula Gulf Night Battle</p>
<p>In the naval night battle of Kolombangara Island and several naval battles, six enemy cruisers and destroyers were sunk, and five enemy transport ships and other ships were sunk and destroyed. Since mid-July, the enemy has worked hard to increase its strength, and on August 15th, dispatched a strong force to land on Vella Lavella Island. The Japanese naval forces immediately launched a fierce attack, heavily damaging enemy ships and aircraft. By this point, in the battlefields of the New Georgia Island area, the enemy and our forces were intertwined in fierce battles. Due to the brave fighting of the Japanese army, the enemy suffered severe damage. By early October, the Japanese army units in that area had gathered and retreated to nearby bases, without being hindered in any way by the enemy. The fighting in the eastern New Guinea area was also extremely fierce. On September 4th, when enemy forces attempted to land near Tufi, the Japanese naval air units combined to bombard them fiercely, inflicting heavy damage. On September 12th, the naval air units heavily bombed Morobe Bay, destroying many enemy ships. Also, from October 12th to 15th, they heavily bombed the enemy ships and land military facilities anchored there.</p>
<p>Harvested Great War Results</p>
<p>In particular, on September 22nd, the naval air units on the sea off Cape Cretin, outnumbered and outgunned, fiercely bombed an enemy transport convoy, and engaged in air combat with enemy fighter squadrons that outnumbered the Japanese by six times. As a result, three enemy cruisers, two destroyers, and one transport ship were sunk, and 14 enemy aircraft were shot down. In total, since September, the Japanese naval air units in that area have sunk 18 enemy transport ships, four cruisers, and two destroyers, and bombed 21 enemy transport ships, cruisers, four destroyers, and many other small ships. Regarding the results of the Japanese submarine warfare, from June to October 20th, a total of 20 enemy ships were sunk, totaling approximately 178,000 tons. In addition, on July 21st, an enemy cruiser was sunk south of Espíritu Santo Island. On September 12th, an enemy Class B cruiser was sunk east of the New Hebrides Islands. Also, on October 3rd, two enemy destroyers were sunk in the South Pacific. At the same time, the Japanese naval forces were also in the various seas of Greater East Asia</p>
<p>Clearing Enemy Submarines</p>
<p>From July to April, the actual enemy submarines cleared were 22. Also, the Japanese naval forces from July to October have gained the following results in various places: 10 enemy cruisers sunk, 18 destroyers sunk, 22 submarines (120,000 tons), and 73 other ships. In addition, the number of enemy ships destroyed was also high. As for the Japanese side's losses, there were six destroyers and twelve other ships. Also, the number of enemy aircraft shot down and destroyed was 1,613, while the Japanese side lost 415. The war situation is becoming increasingly fierce, and the Japanese army and naval forces are fully displaying their power in various places to reduce the enemy's forces.</p>

<h3>The 1st and 3rd Shanghai West Police Bureaus will merge next month, to be uniformly called the First Police Bureau</h3>
<p>The Times reports: According to a revelation from a reliable source yesterday, the 1st and 3rd Police Bureaus, as well as the former Shanghai West police force, have already decided to merge on November 1st. The merged police organization will be uniformly called the First Police Bureau.</p>
<p>Other police bureaus will also be reorganized</p>
<p>It is said that the merger of the police organizations in the three districts is a key step in Mayor Chen Gongbo's plan to build a Greater Shanghai. Subsequently, the police bureaus in other districts of the city will also be reorganized. As for the details of the final reorganization, no confirmed information has yet been obtained. In view of the reorganization plan that has not yet been implemented, the First Police Bureau will be the city's police headquarters. Mayor Chen has stated in his Greater Shanghai construction project that there is no need to establish branches in the central districts of the city, the reason being to ensure closer connections in the management of police affairs in various districts.</p>
<p>Original police officers are not expected to be transferred</p>
<p>The merger plan was originally scheduled to be implemented on December 1st. However, the Party Bureau believed that the details of various organizations had already been completed, so it was advanced. At the same time, it is also learned that no ceremony will be held for the merger of the three police bureaus. This is because the various preparatory work has already been completed, and only cooperation is needed for implementation. After the merger, the personnel of the three district police bureaus will not be transferred. However, efforts will be made to unify the uniforms. Given the high prices at present, this is actually difficult, as the number of police officers in the three districts, including those in the police headquarters, is approximately 8,000.</p>
<h3>50th Period Household Rice - Universal Sale Starts Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Coarse rice sells for eight yuan per liter</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of selling the 50th period of household rice, the Public Works Bureau issued Announcement No. 79 yesterday, stating: It is hereby stipulated that within the period from October 28th to November 3rd of the lunar year, each retail rice store and each rice shop of this Bureau will sell food rice with the 50th rice purchase ticket.

<h3>Japanese-Manchukuo Education Delegation Arrives Safely in Osaka</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Manchukuo Education Delegation, led by head Cai Fuling, left the country on the 1st of this month, first going to Japan and then to Manchukuo. It is now learned that the delegation sent a message from Nagasaki, stating that they have arrived safely in Osaka. They have received a warm reception from the local authorities, who are providing them with facilities for their investigations and leading them to visit various schools. The delegation is scheduled to stay in Osaka briefly and then depart for Nara for investigations.</p>
<h3>Coal Retailers Request Improvement in Rationing</h3>
<p>The members of the Shanghai Coal Retailers Association, in view of the fact that the major coal dealers are not distributing coal rations evenly and are seeking undue profits, resulting in a black market, gathered on a certain day, and over five hundred members jointly signed and stamped a petition to Wang Jingwei, the Chairman of the National Government, the Ministry of Industry, the Special Municipal Government, the Japanese Embassy, the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau, the Municipal Economic Bureau, the Coal Association, the National Chambers of Commerce Control Association, the First District Public Works Bureau, the Eighth District Public Works Bureau, the Economic Division of the First District Public Works Bureau, and the Shanghai Special Municipal Chamber of Commerce, as well as government leaders, requesting the cancellation of the illegal coal rationing rights of the major coal dealers, and authorizing the Coal Retailers Association to be responsible for the Qing rationing, and simultaneously dispatching senior officials to thoroughly investigate past instances of embezzlement and corruption, in order to benefit the people's livelihood and maintain business operations.</p>
<h3>Fresh Milk Deposit - Approved in the First District</h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of supplying fresh milk to households, a person in charge told a reporter from the Central News Agency, "This Bureau and the Eighth District Public Works Bureau have already handled the registration of fresh milk consumer households, so that each consumer household does not arbitrarily choose a dairy farm. This measure is intended to match the needs of consumer households with the current production of licensed dairy farms. At the same time, it can ensure that dairy farms must supply milk to any consumer household that holds a milk supply certificate issued by this Bureau or the Eighth District Public Works Bureau. Furthermore, at present, most businesses in this city conduct cash transactions. It is no exception that milk companies supply milk daily. However, at present, each milk company does not charge its regular customers daily, but only collects accounts once a month. In view of this, the Bureau has decided to approve the collection of a deposit from its regular customers by each milk company, the amount of the deposit being equal to the price of fresh milk supplied for one and a half months, in order to maintain the minimum retail price of each grade of fresh milk as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Cases of Carrying Old Currency - Will be Investigated According to Law</h3>
<p>In order to stabilize the post-war finances, and implement a unified currency, the National Government has designated the Central Reserve Bank's issued Central Reserve Notes as the sole legal currency. All kinds of old currencies in the past have long been explicitly prohibited from use by the Ministry of Finance, and various regulations have been promulgated to punish the carrying of such currencies and obstructing the circulation of the new currency, in order to thoroughly adjust the national monetary system. However, although the Central Reserve Bank has, in accordance with the laws and regulations promulgated by the Ministry, made every effort to redeem them, the old currencies scattered among the people have not yet been fully recovered, and there have been repeated cases of people illegally carrying them. The Shanghai Local Police Department, regarding the handling of such cases, has specially submitted a request to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for instructions, because there are no explicit provisions in the criminal law. It has now been learned by a reporter from the Central News Agency that the Ministry has already telegraphed back to the Department, stating that in handling old currency cases, it should immediately refer to the measures for prohibiting the use of old currency and the measures for the handling and rewards for the seizure of use or carrying of old currency, as promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, and refer to the various announcements of the Ministry for handling, and the District Attorney's Office, upon receiving the order, has immediately notified its subordinate prosecutors, etc., to uniformly investigate according to law.</p>
<h3>Military, Police, and Baojia Personnel - Allowed to Pass During Blockades</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Government, in order to comfort the sick, has allowed doctors to pass when there is a blockade or curfew, and traffic is obstructed. The Municipal Baojia Committee has already ordered each district office and self-governing group, etc., to strictly abide by this regulation. In addition to the fact that fire-fighting and ambulance vehicles and Baojia personnel, whether in uniform or plain clothes, should also be allowed to pass, and the approval of the Municipal Government has been obtained for implementation, orders were also issued yesterday to the subordinates to comply with this.</p>
<h3>Supplementary Funds for Private School Teachers and Staff - Distributed Starting Today, Average Allocation of One Hundred Yuan Per Person</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Authorities, expressing their sympathy for the difficult lives of the teachers in this city, especially in private schools, which, due to poor management, have difficulty improving the treatment of teachers and staff, submitted a request to the Municipal Government for financial assistance. The Municipal Government has approved the allocation of large sums of money as supplementary funds for teachers and staff in private schools. The first batch, totaling 800,000 yuan for September and October, has been fully received by the Municipal Education Association and is scheduled to be distributed starting today.</p>
<p>Distribution Procedures Strive for Thoroughness</p>
<p>Yesterday, a leading member of the Municipal Education Association told a reporter from the Shanghai News Agency that, regarding the distribution of these supplementary funds, the procedures are striving for thoroughness, and all matters are the responsibility of the management and distribution committee organized by representatives of the education associations in each district. The committee has already conducted a detailed investigation of the teachers and staff of each private school. The supplementary funds are distributed on an average basis, not in proportion to salary. As for teachers and staff who work concurrently in various schools, they can only receive one share. If there are any cases of repeated or inflated claims, the principal of the school shall be fully responsible once they are discovered.</p>
<p>Establishing a Teachers and Staff Cooperative</p>
<p>The leading member went on to say that, in addition to raising the salaries of teachers and staff, the Education Association is also planning to reduce their financial burdens. The Association will establish a teachers and staff cooperative, so that people in the education sector can enjoy the allocation of low-priced goods. These goods are entirely necessary for daily life. The Association is currently in special agreement with various manufacturers to provide goods at flat prices. The cooperative's funds will be publicly raised, and after it is established in the future, it will be entirely for the purpose of benefiting the education sector, and will not contain the slightest profit-making motive.</p>
<p>Soliciting Loans for Impoverished Students</p>
<p>At the same time, the Association is also providing relief to impoverished students who have dropped out of school. It is currently planning to raise loans for impoverished students, with a target of one million yuan. Approximately 200,000 yuan has already been obtained. The Association believes that this target cannot be achieved without the assistance of enthusiastic people in society, so it will soon launch a large-scale fundraising campaign, inviting financial, industrial, and commercial figures from all walks of life to provide full assistance. In addition to individual solicitations, it will also hold ball games, charity sales, and other methods, in order to raise enough funds as soon as possible, so that students can go to school.</p>
<p>Procedures for Issuing Supplementary Funds</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Association has stipulated the following procedures for issuing government supplementary funds to private school teachers and staff:</p>
<p>This Association has received 300,000 yuan in supplementary funds for September and 500,000 yuan in supplementary funds for October from the Municipal Government, totaling 800,000 yuan. There are approximately 8,000 teachers and staff in private schools throughout the city (Districts 1 to 8), with an average of 100 yuan in national currency issued to each person (any odd amounts remaining will be added to the next distribution).</p>
<p>The teachers and staff supplementary funds will be handed over to the executive secretary and general affairs secretary of each district education association according to the number of schools and education personnel in each district. They will jointly sign and affix their seals, and report to this Association with a list of schools from October 27th onwards for issuance to the schools.</p>
<p>After the education association in each district receives the supplementary funds, it shall issue them to each school within the deadline stipulated by this Association (October 27th to 31st). If they fail to issue all of them within the deadline, they must submit the names of the schools that have not yet received them to this Association.</p>
<p>The supplementary funds issued by this Association to each district education association are in the form of school checks. When the principal of each school receives them from the district education association, they must affix the school seal and the principal's personal seal to the receipt and hand it over to the district education association.</p>
<p>When each school distributes the supplementary funds to the teachers and staff, the teachers and staff must sign their names and affix their seals to the receipts, and collect the receipts and submit them to this Association, and this Association will return the receipts to the school (Districts 1, 2, 5, 6, and 8 may make changes due to inconvenient transportation).</p>
<p>Private school teachers and staff who have not yet registered with this Association or the district education association should register quickly within this month in order to receive supplementary funds.</p>
<h3>New Citizen's Movement Shanghai Association Convenes District Cadre Meeting</h3>
<p>In order to actively promote the municipal area propaganda work and strengthen the organization of youth groups, the New Citizen's Movement Shanghai Association has scheduled to convene this (27th) afternoon at 3:00 PM, the general secretaries of the New Citizen's Movement branch associations of the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Districts, and the youth group specialists and deputy commanders, to discuss issues such as the propaganda and practice of the New Citizen's Movement work in the municipal area in the future.</p>
<h3>Prices of Soap and Matches Under Examination and Determination - Testing of Soap Ingredients for Hygiene</h3>
<p>Regarding the plan to distribute soap and matches to each household in Districts 1-8, it has been decided that it will be implemented in early next month, and the 397 retail stores have also been decided to handle the various procedures separately. As for the distribution prices, it has been learned that the Municipal Authority is concerned about public health, and the necessary inspection of its ingredients is also underway, so the district health department is currently conducting a chemical test, which will be completed soon. The same soap will be used and the prices will be determined, and contracts will be signed with each of the soap manufacturers.</p>
<p>Matches may be unified in production</p>
<p>As for the match problem, the raw materials for the eleven match manufacturers are distributed by the Central China Match Distribution Association. The quantity distributed each month must be processed by each manufacturer, and then the quantity must still be handed over to the Association for redistribution to the various manufacturers for wholesale to the various retailers for distribution. The Municipal Authority is planning for the various manufacturers to cooperate and uniformly produce a brand, and distribute it to the citizens as much as possible. The Authorities are currently studying and discussing this issue.</p>
<h3>Social Welfare Bureau Prepares for Winter Relief - Charity Performance to Raise Funds for Relief Home</h3>
<p>The Social Welfare Bureau, with the cold winter approaching, and the general homeless poor and the old, weak, disabled, and orphans wandering in the streets of this city being pitiful in the cold, has specially planned winter relief measures, such as distributing clothing and porridge and holding cold shelters, etc. It has been decided to set up the relief home belonging to the Bureau, located on Penglai Road in the South City. There are more than three hundred and fifty old, weak, disabled, orphaned children in the home, and recently, due to the lack of food, they are crying for food, which is particularly pitiful. Therefore, Sheng Guan and others have sponsored a charity performance at the Tianchan Stage, and all the proceeds from the ticket sales will be used as the fund for the home. Ticket prices are divided into four types: 1,000 yuan, 500 yuan, 300 yuan, and 200 yuan. No donations will be collected inside the venue.</p>
<h3>The Zhang Brothers: Celebrating Their Mother's Birthday with Educational Assistance - Donating 30,000 Yuan to the Newspaper's Scholarship Fund</h3>

<h3>A Paradise for Street Children: Shanghai Fuyou Institute</h3>
<p>Gongyi Wharf Street in Jiadu, Nanshi, is now buried under piles of rubble. At the end of the street, a narrow path is marked by barbed wire stretching for several *li*, a characteristic sight of wartime. However, within what resembles an ancient fort amidst the desolate ruins, inside an antique residence enclosed by low white walls, the joyous sounds of children can be heard. A vibrant atmosphere is growing amidst the desolation. Past the snow-white walls and the stone-paved storefronts, a white piece of paper informs you that this is the paradise for educating street children – the Shanghai Fuyou Institute.</p>
<p>Difficult Beginnings</p>
<p>Upon entering the gate, one sees several houses under repair and the installation of electric lights, with workers busily engaged. In the halls and classrooms, teachers and students are focused on their lessons, undisturbed by the arrival of visitors. Dean Ding Fubao and administrator Jiang Tianyi, in discussing the situation at Fuyou Institute, revealed that the creation of such a paradise had indeed required the painstaking efforts of many philanthropists.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a metropolis filled with contradictions. On one hand, there are extravagantly wealthy merchants living luxurious lives, while on the other hand, one can see shocking realities such as poverty, homelessness, unemployment, and crime everywhere. It is precisely the extravagant enjoyment of a few that exacerbates the darkness and suffering of the lower classes. What is most disheartening are the street children, the so-called "little angels of the road," who are without clothes, food, or support, dying of illness and neglect, or committing crimes with impunity – a crisis for society and a loss for the nation. Therefore, a most meaningful charitable endeavor was undertaken.</p>
<p>With academic and moral prestige, Mr. Ding Fubao and Mr. Chen Bingkun, highly regarded in all sectors, deeply appreciated the importance of educating street children and volunteered to undertake this arduous task. In January of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), they founded the Shanghai Fuyou Institute, dedicated to providing relief to impoverished children. The target recipients include street beggars, lost and suffering children, or the children of hidden individuals, children of working men and women who are unable to support them, orphans who have nowhere else to go from refugee shelters, and impoverished children previously cared for by the old Public Concession Children's Home and *Shen Bao*’s news office. Initially, limited by manpower and resources, there were only three teaching staff and several dozen children. All funding was sourced by those in charge, who sought support from various relevant parties.</p>
<p>Six months after its founding, the Shanghai Fuyou Institute officially established a board of directors and began fundraising from all sectors. Because people from all walks of life in Shanghai understood the significance of raising and caring for homeless and suffering children for the country and society, and because the directors of the institute were highly respected in society, donations poured in enthusiastically. What was even more commendable was that Dean Ding Fubao, while leading the institute with strenuous efforts, also managed to expand the institute’s work in educating and caring for street children. By the autumn of last year, a dedicated director, Mr. Wang Ren, was hired to strengthen the workforce. Thus, the Fuyou Institute evolved from a rudimentary organization for educating and caring for needy children into a well-established institution. By this spring, the number of orphans and needy children cared for had reached over 200, and the number of staff had increased to 15. The facilities within the institute were also quite comprehensive. At the same time, a second fundraising campaign was launched, aiming to greatly expand the education of these innocent children, building them into talented people for the nation and preparing them for national rejuvenation.

<h3>Spirit Consolation Cup Football Match: Tung Wah Wins Against the Overseas Chinese Team 2-1</h3>
<p>The second match of the Spirit Consolation Football Charity Match, sponsored by the Greater East Asia Buddhist Association, was held at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon at the Jinyuan Stadium. Tung Wah narrowly defeated the Overseas Chinese team 2-1. During the match, an autographed charity ball was auctioned, with Zhu Shunlin purchasing it for 60,000 yuan. Tung Wah's performance yesterday was full of highlights. Although the Overseas Chinese team lost by one goal, they fought with honor. After the opening ceremony, the fierce battle began. In less than three minutes, Fanxiao of the Overseas Chinese team penetrated deep into the opposing territory as if there was no one there, scoring in the corner and giving the Overseas Chinese team an early lead. At 25 minutes, Tung Wah launched a large-scale counterattack. Dai Linjing, with the help of Han Longhai, scored with a long shot, tying the score. Not long after, the first half ended. After switching sides, Tung Wah's offense intensified, with unstoppable momentum. After 14 minutes, Mai Youliang received a pass from Wang Xisheng and scored with a 30-yard long shot. The Overseas Chinese team's goalkeeper, Pan Liman, was momentarily careless, and the ball went into the net, making it 2-1. The battle then became a close-quarters fight. The Overseas Chinese team had several good opportunities, but they were unable to capitalize. As time ran out, Tung Wah secured the victory with a score of 2-1.</p>

<p>Yesterday’s Newspaper Released at 7:20 PM</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Floating Capital Flows into Shanghai</h3>
<p>People who are idle and do nothing are called "vagrants"; they are also commonly known as "idle vagrants." In the same sense, treasure and gold that are erratic and unproductive are called "floating capital." Vagrants are unemployed, and floating capital is also "idle" because floating capital has not been channeled into normal productive activities. Therefore, it can also be called "unemployed gold."</p>
<p>Before Shanghai implemented economic controls, the abundance of floating capital could be said to be unparalleled for a time. Because there was no way to disperse the floating capital, the result was an unmanageable spiral of rising prices and rampant speculation. Recently, however, due to the authorities' strict economic controls and crackdown on speculation, those who possessed floating capital have had to make plans to change their ways and find outlets for their capital. As a result, most owners of floating capital have gradually invested in various productive enterprises, while a small number have gradually turned to bank savings. Therefore, the financial situation in Shanghai in late October is unusually stable, and credit is more relaxed than before. In short, an outlet for the overall floating capital in Shanghai has been opened up, and it has dispersed like floating clouds.</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were reports that large amounts of floating capital from Tianjin, unable to find an outlet, were flowing south to Shanghai. This is not something we would welcome. Just as the floating clouds in the sky were beginning to dissipate, another wave is coming. I am afraid that Shanghai's economy, which is gradually seeing clear skies, will be affected again. The abundance of floating capital is like the flooding of a river. While we are trying to guide it effectively, we naturally hope that the river will not continue to rise.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Professional Committee Actively Promotes Work: Production Statistics of Flour Mills Last Month</h3>
<p>Since the National Federation of Commerce and Industry's Flour and Wheat Professional Committee implemented unified collection and distribution of flour and wheat, the results have been remarkably good. They have been actively promoting the strengthening and adjustment of internal mechanisms and intensifying the work of flour and wheat collection and distribution in order to fully meet the needs of the people for food. It is understood that the association oversees the major regions in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces.</p>
<p>Flour mills:</p>
<p>Including Fufeng, Yixing, Zhunxin, Sanxing, Dongfu, Huafa in Shanghai; Dahe, Dayi, Xinyi, Sanfeng in Suzhou; Guangyi, Zengyi, Shunfeng, Taiyi, Huaxin, Anfeng, Minyi, Huafa in Wuxi; Chengjin, Dingtai, Zhaoji in Changzhou; Youheng, Jinfeng in Nanjing; Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Gaoyou, and Wuhu, Three Yixing, Huafa, Wuhu, and other 28 companies.</p>
<p>Production volume:</p>
<p>Including 905,057 bags of first-class flour, 883,327 bags of second-class flour, 155,826 bags of third-class flour, and 13,815 bags of fourth-class flour, totaling 1,958,025 bags.</p>
<h3>This Year's Huazhong Rice Crop is Abundant</h3>
<p>According to sources in the grain industry, this year's autumn rice harvest in the Central China region is very abundant. The Wuhu area has had a bumper year, while the Kunshan and Changshu areas have also had about 80% of a normal harvest. Only the area near Taicang is slightly deficient. If the purchasing policies are thorough and the adjustments are well-coordinated, the future of the people's food supply should be secure.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Internal Settlement Meeting of the Money Trade Association</h3>
<p>Resolved that the market price will be 7.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Money Trade Association, in view of the upcoming year-end period for various industries in Shanghai, and to ensure that all money shops collect and settle their long-term credit loans, has been contacting the relevant businesses. For those reputable merchants who are unable to settle due to business needs, the money shops have agreed to extend the terms as appropriate.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to determine the internal settlement market price for December to facilitate settlement procedures, a year-end internal settlement meeting was held as usual at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 26th). As a result,</p>
<p>Internal settlement market price:</p>
<p>The agreed-upon price was 7.5 yuan. It is reported that after the internal settlement meeting, the association held a meeting of executive directors and decided that the interest rate for December will be 5 yuan for deposits and 30 yuan for loans. An announcement has been made to all fellow traders to comply. It is also understood that the</p>
<p>settlement situation for various industries</p>
<p>at the end of the year is good. Most companies have agreed to extend the terms. However, the association has decided to handle new credit loans very carefully, and applications for loans that are not legitimately used for productive activities will not be accepted.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Area Cotton is Also Subject to Unified Purchase</h3>
<p>Estimated to be Approximately 120,000 *Dan*</p>
<p>After it was decided that cotton from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces this year would be subject to unified purchase by the Cotton Division of the Chamber of Commerce, there was concern about whether the purchase of cotton in the Ningbo area of eastern Zhejiang would also be handled by the Cotton Division of the Chamber of Commerce. Last year, cotton produced in the Ningbo area was not subject to the control of the old cotton purchasing agencies. It is understood that this year, because Zhejiang's administration has become unified, cotton in the Ningbo area will also be subject to the unified purchase by the Cotton Division of the Chamber of Commerce. All measures will be the same as in other areas. It is estimated that the cotton production in that area this year will be approximately 120,000 *dan*.</p>
<h3>Trend of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks rebounded yesterday, almost erasing the losses from the afternoon. Stocks rose sharply in a straight line from low prices in the morning, then fluctuated in the afternoon but recovered quickly, with a firm footing. As a result, the stock prices were largely the same as at noon the day before, and even higher than the afternoon prices, especially real estate stocks, which were the most active. Transactions were smooth. The stock market situation is summarized below:</p>
<p>Department Stores: Wing On Company opened at a steady price in the morning, then gradually rose amid buying pressure, peaking at noon. It slightly declined in the afternoon. Wing On, Sincere, and China National Goods companies all saw their prices rise. China National Underwear, Guanwai, and Guanghua Department Stores were also stable. Textile: Wing On Textile rose steadily in the morning and remained stable in the afternoon. China Textile Trust, Rongfeng, and Mayar Silk Factory all saw their prices rise. Smaller textile stocks also rebounded accordingly. Xinfeng Printing and Dyeing, Zhenzhong, Guoxin, Tianlun, and Lunhua were all priced higher than the previous day. Jingxu Shirt erased its losses from the previous night, and Jinglun stabilized.</p>
<p>Industry: Da Zhonghua Match rebounded from a low price, Nanyang Brothers Tobacco stabilized, Jiu An Industrial rose slightly, and Xin Ya Construction also rebounded. Datong Business, China, and Guohua shares were all stable. Da Zhonghua Industrial opened 10% higher. Kangyuan Confectionery was in demand in Guanwai, and its price rose again. Guanshengyuan and Standard Food were both on the rise.</p>
<p>New Drugs: Xin Ya Pharmaceutical rose by several yuan, and Zhongfa was also priced higher than the previous day. Zhongxi, Jiufu Pharmaceutical, and Xin Zhong Pharmaceutical rose slightly. Ruixin Pharmaceutical fell slightly, while Wuzhou was unchanged.</p>
<p>Finance: Jincheng and Yeqing opened higher, recovering from the previous day's prices. Continental, Shanghai, and Zhejiang were all unchanged. Zhongyi Trust was slightly lower.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Public Bonds: The market showed another distorted trend yesterday. Because those who had been trading in spot bonds had switched to next-day bonds, which allowed for "mutual offsetting," there were often dozens of accounts involved for a single ten-thousand-yuan bond. Next-day bonds also allowed for one-day rollovers, but commissions had to be paid. For those who insisted on settling the transaction on the same day, the market price could be freely adjusted. The price of C-type bonds was strong at first, but then saw a pullback. Afterward, it gradually rose again. The closing price at noon was slightly higher than the previous day, which was entirely due to the influence of futures. The fact that the other four types of bonds (A, B, D, and E) showed only limited gains is clear evidence of this. The price difference between miscellaneous brands and C-type bonds was very large, and the distorted situation became more and more serious.</p>
<p>Interbank Lending Rate: The Money Trade Association's posted interbank lending rate remained unchanged at 1.2%.</p>
<p>Rice and Grain: There was a shortage of rice and grain arriving by both water and land, and retail sales were slow. Wholesale transactions were lively, and the market trend was upward. Oilseeds were actively sold at retail prices and remained firm. Woolen Fabrics: Standard market prices for woolen fabrics such as riding breeches and camel-hair serge have continued to rise in recent days. The prices of all brands have increased by an average of several tens of dollars per yard. This is because seasonal sales are brisk and orders for coats from mainland customers continue to increase, leading to strong demand. The prices of Zhanghua brand fabrics, which are stocked in all factories and stores, are particularly firm and even higher than listed prices.</p>
<h3>Securities Exchange Sets Business Rules</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange was approved by the Ministries of Finance and Industry to resume operations, the resumption ceremony was held on the 29th of last month. All brokers have now been reviewed and announced, and licenses have been issued by the Ministry of Industry. Brokers have also paid security deposits in accordance with the articles of association. The listed stocks have been reviewed and approved separately, and the layout of the market has been completed. Settlements are to be cleared every Monday. It is also reported that in order to prevent securities speculation, the exchange has formulated "Business Rules," which specify the trading security deposits, brokerage fees, market opening and closing dates, official market prices, and all other matters related to trading.</p>
<h3>Customs Partially Abolishes Import and Export Surcharges, Revises Tax Rates, and Implements Adjustments</h3>
<p>The Chinese Customs has recently made major revisions to various import and export duties and has partially abolished various surcharges from the past. The abolished surcharges include: Export Surcharges: A) Flood Relief Surcharge of 5% (calculated on the tax rate, same below), B) Export Surcharge of 5% and Import Surcharge of 5%. Import Surcharges: A) Flood Relief Surcharge of 5%, B) Import Surcharge of 5%. Other taxes originally collected by the Customs on behalf of other agencies, such as dredging taxes, will still be collected by the Customs.</p>

<h3>How Should the Broadcasting Association Adjust Programs After Collecting Fees?</h3>
<p>The China Broadcasting Association recently announced that all radio listeners in Beijing and Tianjin must sign a listening agreement with the association and pay a monthly listening fee of ten yuan for broadcasting purposes. I think all listeners are processing this, but I would like to bring up the following two points about the current broadcasts for the Bureau to adjust:</p>
<p>Advertising Problem: The number of advertisements broadcast by radio stations in this city recently is very high. Listeners can hear the reporters' eloquent voices as soon as they turn on the radio. The length of these segments often takes up most of the program time, which is uninteresting and even annoying. Radio stations accepted advertisements before the war, originating from commercial radio stations, but commercial radio stations have disappeared since the Greater East Asia War, so there should no longer be this kind of advertising report. Moreover, many of these advertisements are for national products, and they should be immediately banned. Some say that radio stations accept advertisements because of limited finances. Now that the Broadcasting Association has collected listening fees, the radio stations can be maintained by appropriations from the Broadcasting Association.</p>
<p>Program Problems: After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, there was only one radio station in this city with Chinese as the main language, Shanghai Radio Station. In addition, radio stations such as Germany, France, and the Soviet Union mainly used foreign languages, with only one or two Chinese programs, but these mainly reported news and taught foreign languages. Therefore, there seems to be too little for Chinese people to listen to, with only one channel available. In terms of program content, although there are many entertainment and educational programs, there are too many low-level programs, such as Shanghai opera, Yue opera, and comedy. Listening to them is a bit too coarse, so there is a need to adjust the Chinese language programs. - Lei Di</p>
<h3>Reflections on the Municipal School Teachers' Request</h3>
<p>— An Unfairness</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government has already issued subsidies to private schools, demonstrating that the government is indeed mindful of the poor living conditions of teachers and staff. It is striving to stabilize the lives of educational staff and increase the salaries of those engaged in education, which is heartening for everyone to see. However, according to news reports, teachers from seventy-two municipal schools, finding their income (220 yuan per month) insufficient to cover personal living expenses (barely enough to buy seven large pancakes a day), are requesting an increase of 800 yuan on top of their base salary of 30 yuan. Given the current prices and the fact that the standard salary for teachers in both northern and southern municipalities is actually above 50 yuan, is this request still considered too high? Consider that before the Incident, a monthly salary of 30 yuan, after deducting 5 or 6 yuan for meals, still left 25 or 26 yuan, enough to support parents, a wife, and children with a simple, frugal life. Now, even if the municipal government acknowledges the poor living conditions of teachers and "approves the request," it would only be enough to support a small family of husband and wife. (This is considering current prices; if prices increase in the next month or two, this meager 800 yuan might not even be enough to support a husband and wife.) If there are parents and children to support, they will inevitably have to struggle just to survive. Where will "stability" be found?</p>
<p>The author shares the importance of educational work and sympathizes with the hardship of elementary school teachers' lives (no, it's not enough to fill one's stomach), and cannot remain silent. Therefore, I especially speak out on their behalf, hoping that the government will provide these "nurses of the nation" with the bare minimum living materials (such as the cost of meals for five or six people before the Incident). At the same time, I also hope that parents whose children are in school will work together to help teachers for the sake of their children's future, so that teachers can focus on teaching and students can focus on learning. The future of the nation is fortunate, and the future of the country is fortunate! Schools should not neglect</p>
<p>Schools Should Not Neglect Air Defense and Seek Innovation</p>
<p>Under the supervision and guidance of the Municipal Bureau and Baojia offices, citizens throughout Shanghai are paying considerable attention to air defense facilities and are following the instructions of the authorities. However, to our surprise, many schools in Shanghai are currently ignoring this issue. When we investigated further, we found that some schools do not have paper on their windows. Sand, mud, and water tanks are nowhere to be seen. Could it be that those in the education sector are more indifferent to air defense facilities than other sectors? Schools are cultural institutions, especially for reading children, who are all the future masters of the new China. Parents entrust their children to schools, placing great expectations on them. Schools should naturally assume responsibility for protecting students during school hours. Only then can they prepare for any eventuality and live up to parents' expectations. Otherwise, if there is an air raid, and the school is completely unequipped, students will be panic-stricken, glass will shatter, children will be injured, and fires may break out. What will be done then? As principals and those responsible, how can they ignore this and not take it to heart!</p>
<h3>A Suggestion to Turn Discarded Tram Tickets into Lottery Tickets</h3>
<p>— Yuan Liuxian</p>
<p>Ticket sellers skimming fares directly reduces the company's revenue and indirectly increases the burden on citizens. Although the company authorities have repeatedly appealed for public cooperation, it has been difficult to achieve results. The reason is that most passengers are generous and only care if the ticket inspector comes. They are not concerned about whether they have a ticket, whether the fare is correct, or anything else that does not benefit them personally, which is deeply ingrained in the Chinese character. They may even be ambushed by the ticket seller when getting off the tram, which is even more unworthy. My suggestion is that the company authorities should encourage passengers to collect tram tickets and hold monthly drawings, giving prizes worth a hundred times the ticket price to the winners. The advantages of this method are briefly described below:</p>
<p>Passengers holding tram tickets have a chance to win a prize, so they will never pay the fare without taking a ticket or return the ticket to the ticket seller to give to someone else when getting off the tram. With a prize of a hundred times the ticket price, passengers will never accept tram tickets with incorrect fares. The prize vouchers can be used to purchase monthly tickets, so the company does not need to spend extra. However, if monthly tickets are given out directly, there is no advantage of the second point. Discarded tickets scattered on the road are unsightly. Setting up ticket collection boxes or hiring people to clean them up would require expenses. This method can save money. Passengers who skim fares themselves can also be reduced.</p>

<h3>The Youyou Nursery Home Appeals to All Sectors for Needy Children</h3>
<p>The environment is moving in a difficult direction, and hundreds of needy children are a strong force for the future of society. The burden of educating and caring for these needy children has become unprecedentedly difficult, and urgent new efforts and new contributions are needed to continue this sacred task of educating and caring for needy children.</p>
<p>The Youyou Nursery Home has been established for three years, and is currently launching its fourth fundraising campaign. Despite various difficulties, it has resolutely launched this campaign, proposing the huge figure of 800,000 yuan, hoping that kind people in society who love and care for the home will continue to donate with boundless generosity, so that the weak seedlings can receive the nourishment of sweet dew and thrive.</p>
<p>Whenever the environment worsens, kind people in society who care for the home provide further assistance. They treat the education and care of the needy children in the home as their own affair, protecting them with the greatest "love" in the world. The environment can only reduce the number of unfortunate children (the home dismissed some children last year). The environment can only reduce the effectiveness of the donations that have already been raised, but it can never sever the close and warm love that kind people in society have always given to the home. A difficult environment has produced excellent methods to overcome difficult environments, and a difficult environment will bring great help to overcome difficult environments. Today, "relieving needy children" will become the most active cause, and it is breeding a brand-new writing, which will write an immortal page in the history of needy children's relief.</p>
<p>Kind and benevolent people in society, kind and benevolent people who care for the home! The more than 260 innocent and pure children in the home are looking forward to your grand leadership of the "Relief of Needy Children" - generous donations. Your names and your great achievements will be gloriously written forever in the history of needy children and will be eternally engraved in the hearts of all needy children.</p>
<p>Pushan Villa</p>
<h3>Charitable Burial Achievements</h3>
<p>Pushan Villa in this city is a well-known, pragmatic group dedicated to providing burial and covering up exposed bodies. Its founder, Mr. Wang Junsheng, gathered comrades and has been working diligently and unremittingly from the late Qing Dynasty to the present day. It has always been trusted by people in society, and funds have been continuously donated by various sectors, lasting for thirty years without decline. However, due to the excessive surge in the price of lumber in recent years, the financial aspect is still inevitably strained. As it celebrates its 30th anniversary, the villa plans to raise funds widely to enrich its finances, hoping that people from all walks of life will sympathize and be happy to help. The working situation of the villa up to 31 years is briefly recorded as follows: from the 2nd year of the Republic of China to the 31st year, a total of 662,604 large and small corpses and 90,119 skeletons have been collected. 261,522 large and small coffins and 86,404 urns have been provided. The above is based on the villa's annual work report.</p>
<p>Charity Sale to Help Students</p>
<h3>Diary on the Fourth Day</h3>
<p>The second day, Saturday, October 9th, Wang Shouzhong returned from selling flower knots. ××× said that he met the big movie star Mr. × at the Great Light Theater today, "with a very large air." He hurried over to peddle. As a result, not only was he given the cold shoulder, but he was also scolded. He seemed very angry when he said this, so I couldn't help but comfort him. The saying "hard work is unrewarding" is evident here.</p>
<p>He also told me the best way to peddle flower knots. He said: When he finds his target and gets it, he rushes over to pick a flower knot that is most suitable for the person's identity and pins it on this gentleman, "Sir, would you like to donate and buy a student aid knot? We are the Youth Association's Boys' Department and the United Youth Group Badge - pointing to the group badge on his body! It is a student aid knot sold for the Shen Xin Two Newspaper's loan scholarship. This kind of knot is suitable for both men and women's clothes and hair. In fact, before I finish speaking, he will take out money and ask the price, and then I will complete my mission."</p>
<p>The fourth day, Sunday, October 10th, I followed the method taught by ××× to sell student aid knots. Sure enough, the results were better than before. There were exceptions, but they were ultimately in the minority.</p>
<p>××× had a headache today, and ××× said that his foot disease had recurred. This said that he would be scolded for being late, and that said that he would be deducted points by the school authorities for missing class. I comforted them one by one, saying, "This is the last day, everyone, work a little harder, and we will end tonight." They were all very obedient. I was happy for a while, and I was the first to work hard, so that the evening appointment with Pengfang was delayed. This warmth of friendship makes me feel less lonely. When I am alone, I often think that I have already helped many people invisibly. These people are all my friends who I have seen but do not know. I feel that our hard work is not without reward, and spiritual happiness is</p>
<p>Postscript</p>
<p>On Saturday the 16th of this month, everyone was free. Several responsible persons in our group went to the Baxianqiao Youth Association together with the Boys' Department staff and the representative of the Meilun Waterproof Fabric Manufacturing Co., Ltd. to count the boxes. The result was only more than 8,000 yuan, which was unexpected. Everyone was stunned. We estimated that the total would be over 10,000. How could there be only this much? Mr. Gu Haosheng saw what we meant and comforted us, saying, "Although the results of this council are certainly not the best, it's actually quite good for the first time." You only have about four and a half days, and you don't sell every day. The staff is also very clumsy. The time for selling flower knots often conflicts with homework. These are always a few points that limit the results of your fundraising from meeting the initial expectations, but the results cannot be considered unreasonable. Even if we are bad, we should be happy. Our happiness is built on helping others, and you should be happy about this enthusiasm!" After we were enlightened by him, we finally smiled a little.

<p>For Those Selling Houses</p>
<h3>Beware of Scams</h3>
<p>I am selling a friend's house on their behalf. Due to personal matters, I placed an advertisement in the Shen Xin Two Newspapers to sell it at a low price in order to resolve the matter as soon as possible. The next morning, a young man of about 25 or 26 years old, claiming to be surnamed Zhang, came to see the house. After contacting him, he quoted the lowest price for decoration costs. He immediately claimed to be a house broker and also dealt in stocks and real estate. He told me that there was a severe shortage of houses on the market and strongly advised against selling it at a low price. I told him that I was busy with store matters and did not want to profit. He then asked about the Huili Stock Exchange at No. 229 Daquan Building. The telephone number is 90647, but he forgot to bring his card and apologized. He said that the house was insured at a high price and could be sold. After the deal was completed, he asked for a reward. I declined repeatedly, but he refused to leave. Later, the house viewers helped contact him, but no deals were made. He took the opportunity to steal my wife's purse, which contained more than 200 yuan in pocket money and a small diamond ring. I didn't notice it at the time. When I discovered it, I went to the address and telephone number he left, but they were completely fake. That's when I realized I had been scammed. At the time, he was wearing a blue top and dark gray jacket, yellow leather shoes, and a flower. He had long hair, a thin face, a pointed chin, and was very eloquent, speaking in the Shanghai Pudong accent, supposedly from Chuansha, Pudong. I would like to inform everyone that if you are selling a house, please pay attention to this person, or something similar. If you find him, please monitor him closely to avoid being scammed.

<h3>Impurities Analysis of Household Rice</h3>
<p>— Xiaomin</p>
<p>The amount of household rice distributed in this city this month is still only one liter of coarse rice per person, which is far from meeting the minimum food needs of each person. Furthermore, the quality is poor. Last night, I picked out one bowl (approximately equal to four he) of coarse household rice from the 49th period and found the following five kinds of non-brown rice: 118 grains of millet and rotten rice, 420 seeds of ragweed, 76 grains of sand and mud, 4 small insects, and 1 tablespoon of red-picked rice (containing a large amount of sand powder). I think these impurities are not necessarily all mixed in by the rice shop. The authorities should not try to improve.</p>
