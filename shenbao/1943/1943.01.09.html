<p>社評</p>
<h3>論參戰</h3>
<p>據最近消息：國府將決定參戰了。這是民國三十二年第一件大事。</p>
<p>我們站在人民的立塲、在一國的國策未確定以前，人民應該有說話的權利；可是，在國策旣經決定之後，人民除了擁護以外，就沒有話可說。這次國府將決定參戰，至少在我們人民是感到突然的。因此，也就沒有對政府盡我們獻言的機會，現在參戰將成國策了，我們只有擁護國策。</p>
<p>我們爲什麼要在這時參戰，參戰的意義，目的，任務怎樣？參戰以後，我們人民應該怎樣？政府在事前必有充分的研究和準備，而且即日必有明文昭告人民，這裏不必多加推測。</p>
<p>我們人民所最關心的問題是參戰以後如何？謹敢掬誠獻言於當局者兩端：</p>
<p>第一是尊軍民意。參戰是一國的國策，有着戰略上的機密的意義，在事前或許不可能徵取人民的公意。可是，參戰旣確定爲國策了，參戰以後的一切步驟，一切辦法，如何集中人力物力，如何推行戰時體制，如何增進國際協力，諸凡有關國家民族前途和人民大衆生活的，都必需廣徵人民的公意，都必須取得人民充分的了解。我們不嫌重覆地指出：人民是最重要也是最後的決定力量。國策之最後的貫澈，一切政策政令的貫澈與實現，如果沒有得到人民自動的積極的參加和擁護，決不會順利推行，決不會順利完成。如果不願意國策自國策，人民自人民，兩者不協同，那麼，今後一切就必須廣採民意，博徵輿情，尤其是要充分發揚人民的力量。也只有這樣尊重民意，才能實現國策，才能爭取勝利。</p>
<p>第二是維護國力，維護國家民族的元氣。我們知道過去政府主張和平，既是積極意義的和平，其最高目標就在於維持國族的命脈。今日的參戰，既然不是過去和平運動的否定，而是更積極的以求世界新秩序的和平之實現，其最高目標還是維護國族之生存。那麼，對於國力不僅在求充分的發揮；同時，還要充分的培養與愛護。譬如過去在重慶政權之下，舉凡壯丁之抽徵，物資的搜集，無一不擾害社會，危及民命，使國力爲之削弱，民族元氣斵喪，此種現象，希望在參戰以後，決不會在和平區內出現。</p>
<h3>國府決定最高方針　中日協力益强化　兩國關係入新階段　日本政界方面觀測</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　中日協力關係、自國府汪主席此次蒞日訪問後、已益趨强化、預料今年將更有飛躍進展、關於中日關係新階段之動向、據此間政界方面人士談稱、國府汪主席於大東亞戰爭甫越週年、蒞臨我國訪問朝野、此足以表示國民政府當局之最高方針　在以中日兩國結成東亞軸心、於各方面協力完成大東亞戰爭、此事殊值吾人重視、關於各種中日協力具體問題、中日兩國意見似已完全一致、此一觀去歲十二月二十二日汪主席在東京所發表之談話、即可明瞭、吾人認爲國府之毅然採取此種最高方針、於此大東亞戰爭下第二年新春、整個東亞命運、已將決定之重大時期、吾人當然期待國府以某種形式、作新的發展、即汪主席於去歲十二月二十五日、在東京發表告日本國民之廣播演說中、亦曾謂我想明年的一年是貴國把大東亞戰爭以來所繼　得到的偉大戰果、加以確保的一年、也是貴國使大東亞戰爭繼續得到勝利、臻於完遂的一年、此即說明本年是決戰之年、其次又曾披瀝堅固之決意、國民政府推進精神動員及軍事經濟之準備工作、以協助大東亞戰爭之完成、並由同甘共苦而進至同生共死、以整個東亞民族之同志的團結、必可獲得大東亞戰爭之最後勝利、在主席之聲明、明示國民政府已藉大東亞戰爭而由本來之大後方立塲、進至最前綫之立塲、新國民運動、以完成精神總動員體制、藉中央儲備券以確立幣制、又如產業經濟之準備改善、及軍隊之準備充實等、均　視爲實施協力體制之準備工作、而在汪主席一行返國以後、國府上下無不在汪主席領導之下、推進國府最高方針、協力完成大東亞戰爭、吾入對此實深敬佩、如最近上海新中國報於汪主席發表艷　四週年紀念日之社評中、曾指出國府還都爲第一次躍進、中日滿締盟爲第二次躍進、大東亞戰爭爆發與同甘共苦爲第三次躍進、今乃將作第四次之躍進、並謂艷電發表業已四年、吾人業已完成　同甘共苦更進一步之準備工作、以進入大東亞戰爭之最前綫、與友邦同作同生共死之卓絕奮鬥、决準備一切力量、爭取大東亞戰爭之最後勝利、此種第四次飛躍之發展、對於新中國之建設歷史、實具有決定意義云云、此可謂已反映中國民衆之輿論、深望中日協力體制有新的展開云、</p>

<p>醫學常識</p>
<h3>靑年人易犯的毛病　胃酸過多症　不宜妄用鹼性中和藥劑　應使胃腸根本强健起來</h3>
<p>飯後經過二三小時，心口作痛，吞酸嘈雜，但手壓胃部，痛疼便止，又水或食品一到胃內，痛疼自然消去——這樣容態，乃爲胃酸過多的症狀。按醫學統計，胃酸過多症患者，其年紀三十一歲至四十歲者佔全體之三成，二十一歲至三十歲以及四十一歲至五十歲者各佔二成二分要之全數的七成以上，乃由血氣正旺的靑年所佔啦。尤其是　　薪俸階級人的</p>
<p>胃酸過多症，近年有顯著增多的現象，令人最堪憂慮的問題。此外不是他們整天倚案辦公，無暇運動，攝生不宜所致。</p>
<p>此症因沒有劇烈的痛苦，所以往往被人看輕，但專門醫師方面頗注重之，因爲此症往往倒錯，卽形似過酸症，其實減酸症的頗不乏例，而且此症最易俱發胃潰瘍十二和指糖潰瘍由是此症如何複雜，如何危險，可以槪見吧。那麼對此症怎樣調理呢。藥劑方面，從來盛用的重是曹劑此藥因屬鹼性，故有中和胃酸的功効，但在一面，有効果之暫時，易成習慣等等缺點。</p>
<p>在此意味，另欲推獎的是和化學製劑完全不同，効能發揮所謂細胞原形質賦活作用，而對病源有積極救治的功効，所以無論過酸症與減酸症，如服用本劑，則反常中的胃酸分泌機能，便可歸復正常，胃內的酸度自然整頓起來，至於胃潰瘍，則因其潰瘍而新生健全的細胞故症狀自然輕快，如此本劑，旣有溯源治病的偉効又不作任何副作用又連用也不成習慣，故服用最爲安全。</p>

<h3>西北的交通</h3>
<p>一月五日　澳門寄來</p>
<p>川陝公路上有數不盡的各種交通工具終日在奔馳者，路面自然容易損瓖。有幾段路簡直壞得不堪。</p>
<p>山實羯至成都，比較起來四川公路破爛，特別顯著的是從廣元至梓澺，這一段常常發生翻車事件，橋樑亦多失修，車行其上，英不惴惴然。劍閣路上，天下着雨，路面全成了爛黄泥。劍閣是一向聞名的險路，則天晴時，行車亦常肇事。我們的車勉强上了坡，很徼倖的下了坡。剛走下最陡的坡時，看見兩三路工正在舖黄土，乘客們欣喜可以走一段乾路了，那想到他們一面撒土，一面竟澆起水來。雨不停地下着，水不停地酒着，路更難走了。這是怎麽修路？</p>
<p>廣元綿陽兩渡口，設備太簡，內江渡口比較週到。西北交通頻繁，而路面，橋樑，坡，度，渡口，還不能整修改善。</p>
<h3>所羅門談薈</h3>
<p>— 蒼生</p>
<p>十六世紀的中葉，中國正是文物昌盛的大明天下，歐洲西部各國崇奉所謂重商主義，積極向海外尋求殖民地。那時候，有一個西班牙航海家孟大拿，於一五六七年在這日光鼎沸的赤道南邊，發現所羅門羣島，他以爲尋到了耶路撒冷所羅門帝廟黄金的發源地，就定爲今名。這所羅門羣島五字，象微中世紀以後經濟上的重商主義，和數百年來歐洲帝國主義向外發展一段故事。</p>
<p>所羅門羣島，共有九僩大島，十六個小島，東南濱珊湖海，西北角接近新不列顛島，長一千二百七十五英里。南部屬英國版圖已有五十多年。上次歐戰以後，北部又由德國轉讓給於國。各島面積，總計萬四千六百方英里。在日本人佔據以前，住有白人五百，中國人二百，又有頭毛蓬鬆的當地土人，約一萬左右。從前有許多土人，給白人運到附近島嶼充作奴隸，他們氣憤不過，就以燒殺白人，食肉寢皮，當作一種禮式，希望安慰作奴隸者死後的怨魂。</p>
<p>這羣島的東南部，有佛羅里達小島，旁邊有杜拉基一僩很小的島，僅長二英里，因爲有佛羅里達島做屛障，不受熱帶颶風影響，形勢極似英國斯卡巴軍港。上次歐戰時，英國海軍上將詹里科，說是太平洋上最優良的東港，可藏英國全部艦隊。南邊的瓜達爾康納島，北部地勢平坦，可建築飛機塲。北邊的馬來太島，完全是田地，可以掩護杜拉基軍港。</p>
<p>這所羅門羣島給日本佔領以後，最受咸脅的，是美國到歐洲澳洲的航錢。這一條航綫，是保護歐洲的唯一希望，從檀香山到澳洲雪利，約六千七百英里，必須經過新喀里多尼亞島。但該島離杜拉基祇有一千一百英里，極受日本飛機和海軍的威脅。摩勒斯比軍港，（距杜拉基八百九十英里）早就岌岌可危。雪梨，（距杜拉基一千八百英里）達爾文兩處，時刻可受日本海軍和空軍的脅迫。</p>
<p>美國海軍金總司令，八月十日發表公吿說　事進行，十分困難，損失的慘重，自難避免，但此種作戰經騐，將來很有用處。</p>
<p>敵前登陸戰術，日本方面，是司空見慣的。在美國却是大驚小怪的事，全國爭相吿語，如感電觸，似乎是一件天大的難事。</p>
<p>美國的水兵，分爲二個單位，在東岸者，稱爲大西洋水上陸戰隊，司令部在卡邏來納州，在西岸者稱爲太平洋水上陸戰隊，司令部在加利福尼亞州。</p>

<h3>南美福克蘭島　美軍登陸　阿根廷深為震動</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城七日哈瓦斯社電此間政界人士對於美軍在福克闌羣島登陸、俾「與英軍合作共同保衛此一屬地」一項消息、深爲震動、若干報紙載稱、阿根廷對於此舉勢難苟同、良以一此爲對於泛美洲理想之一種特殊觀念」也、按此一羣島、位於阿根廷沿岸、一八三四年爲英人所佔領、南美人自稱之爲馬維那斯　島、其後英人改稱福克蘭　島、但阿根廷仍認為此乃本國領土、對於英人之佔領該羣島、從未予以承認、因此常爲兩國政府間所討論之問題、一九三四年爲英人佔領該羣島百年紀念日、阿根廷曾發行紀念郵票、票面印有全國地圖、仍將福克蘭羣島列人版圖之內云、按該羣島居民僅有二千五百人</p>

<h3>美國空軍戰敗後的更張</h3>
<p>兩個話題</p>
<p>日本陸軍航空本部部員陸軍少佐木下春二郎　譯自三一年十二月「航空文化」</p>
<p>同樣一句話，由於說法的巧拙或表現方法的各異，會產生出極不相同的感覺和意外的結果。</p>
<p>這裏課於筆者的題目，原是「關於美國的空軍」。在這重大的時局之下，若果　使一般的人產生了非筆者所預期的結果，則其責任不能不說是非常重大的。因此，就想把本文的結論先來說一說。</p>
<p>總括一句話，我們應該「見大敵而不懼，見小敵而不驕。這次戰爭，雖然敵人初戰卽敗，然而他們背後的國力，却是相當龐大的，所以我們不應陶醉於初戰的勝利而存着驕敵之心。</p>
<p>不過，對於他們龐大的兵力和生產力，却也不必妄存着恐懼之心。不用說，我們必須確實認識目下的情勢，和必須有着充分對敵的準備。</p>
<p>現在日本人未免過於歡天喜地的在喊着「勝了，勝了」。如其還有抱着戰爭已經越過了難關等等的見解者，那眞是荒謬絕倫。須知戰爭還不過是剛剛開始的當兒，也就是剛剛開始達到了一個階段而已。其次的階段，眞是磨練我們的非常困難的階段哩！</p>
<p>第一，日本雖在喊着「勝了！勝了！」的時候，美　却並不那樣地在認爲「敗了！敗了！」美國有着他們那樣的領土，只失了東亞一隅之地，似乎是不會感到很大的痛癢的。因爲他們直到現在，還來不及於軍備一事。試想美國儘管是怎樣的富有，它能够那樣簡單地除了擔當世界兵器總發行所的重任以外，遝能充分顧到自己的一份嗎？然而從這次羅斯福的大擴軍案逐次實現一事，却可歸結到一九四三年對日反攻也在逐次實現着，就飛機來說，一九四二年度六萬架，一九四三年度十二萬五千架，其數目之大，不愧稱為天文學的數字。這樣鉅大的數字發表之時，他們的議會，在驚駭之餘，羣起喧嚷，拍手不已，據說其中還有一個議員，竟不覺從嘴裏吹出嘯聲來，會使美國人也吃驚起來，則其規模之大，可以想見了。</p>
<p>要之，美國是初次受到酷烈的打擊的，現在好像呈着暫時退下去從容整頓，預備再出的姿態。</p>
<p>這樣說來，似乎美國是很泰然自若的了，然而倒也並不如此。日本人一向抱着「美國是民族雜湊之國，不久其內部就要崩潰」的議論，最近這個議論，已經消聲匿跡，這確是件堪以注目的事。出於希望的觀察，往往容易和預想或預測相混。現在美國據說已經流行着：「勿忘珍珠港」這句話了。珍珠港似乎是他們的一件痛心的事，而其意外流露着的報復之心，却是不能忽視的，何況羅斯福這個大野心家，一定是深知美國人民的弱點和缺點等的。近來福特工廠以下所有的美國汽車工廠，差不多全部改成了飛機工廠，他們的巧妙的手段，雖屬敵人也不能不加以稱贊的。現在美國，據說民用汽車已經一架也不在製造了。開戰當初，羅然强化橡皮使用的限制，那時各方對之，似乎都有怨言，可是到了現在，這種不平之鳴，到處已不再聽見了。現在從他們手裏的橡皮存貨，人造橡皮，再製橡皮以及在南美種植出來的橡皮樹等推想，可以知道他們是確保着相當的必需量的。美國政府和美國國民實是非常認眞的，如其仍舊把Yarkee和Monkey混在一起，正像他們稱我（日未）爲Jap而當作野蠻國家看待一樣。</p>
<p>講到這裏，我便想從最近的報紙裏，提出兩個問題。那就是賽發斯基的論文和開撒的提議。美國發生這兩種議論，是値得注意的。</p>
<p>賽發斯基少校，原是一個出身蘇維埃聯邦的人，他所著「由空軍之力的勝利」一書，爲美國敢近銷行最廣的書。它的內容，總括一句話來說，就是：「美國若不更加大事增强空軍，便不能擊敗日本。」他說：「美國必須改革對於陸海軍及空軍的觀念。儘管把海軍如何擴大，縱令能把日本艦隊擊滅，如其日本空軍依舊存在，則莫說要在日本本土登陸，就是要空襲日本本土也是不可能的。美國應該把擴大軍備預算的大部分，充作製造飛機之用，那麽到了一九四五年，便能採取正式的對日攻勢了。」他又說：「與其建造船隻，不如建造大飛艇和飛機，如以馬丁式的飛艇和道格拉斯BI19的飛機等，巾阿留申出發，空襲東京，往返轟炸，也是極簡單的事。」馬丁PB2M式飛艇和道格拉斯BI19式飛機，據說都具有一萬三千公里的航續距離，所以即使從荷蘭港出發，也可以飛到東京，在那裏來回，大約只有八千公里的路程。然而這計劃要想提早實行，是不可能的。因爲上述二者，都是尙在去年時候方纔試造的，其後不知在什麽地方把其踪跡隱匿下去了。然而此等都是特爲大型機的試騐研究而製造的，從許多關於這事的辯論看來，說不定已經一部分在移入大量製造的工程中了。</p>
<p>賽發斯基的上述議論，雖然並不怎樣新頴，然而他還說到一件令人佩服的事，那就是他指出「美國飛機是列强中最蹩脚的。」這話聽來似乎有點神經過敏，可是在美國人之間，竟有說這樣話的人，而且其所著的書那樣的大受國民購讀。從這點來說，我們也有一加考慮的必要。美國的航空工業及航空技術，一向是被認為和德國並駕齊驅而選到世界最高的水準了的。在事實上也的確保有着可以給人承認的實力。而竟謂「美國的飛機小足道」，這不像是在說瘋話嗎？然而隨着大東亞戰爭的進行，美國飛機在南方各地被日本飛機一架一架擊落下來的一事看來，那　恐怕他們的確是在認眞地作這樣想了。然而反顧日本人民時在作怎樣想呢！那知却已在開始自誇「日本飛機是世界第一」了。這眞是最可使人寒心的一件事。日本的飛機，在性能上確楚相當優良的，然而　不能自誇爲世界第一。飛機的不完備和數量的不足，是靠着我航空部隊的本領來補救的。靠着補救之餘，而把敵人擊敗，這是實在的事實吧。日本的技術家，一向信任美國飛機的性能，常想努力追趕及之。然而這次由鹵獲及由其他原因到手的敵機的性能看來，較諸他們的宣傳，有點不及。他們完全靠着目錄樣本宜傳其飛機的性能，以便賣給他國，看穿了這點，就要後悔莫及。我們的技術家，如其眞的受了他們提示的目錄樣本的　，那麽揭破他們的假面具，而來切切實實製造飛機，決沒有什麽慚愧的。現在如其在這裏就生出自誇之心來，則我國便不能不犯上爲機械而犧牲人命的大誤了。是以我國惟有自認其飛機，遠不及列强，而力求其進步興發逮才是。</p>
<p>這裏就發生了本領的問題，我們現在至少可以公然宣構，我們的空軍精銳，實是一機當千的，而且爲使將來也能在空中集中一機當千的精銳起見，便深深感到自初即須把特具優秀的資質者，吸收到空軍裏去。玉不磨，不能出光，然若原是一塊石頭，則縱怎樣去磨練，也楚磨不出怎麼樣的光澤來的。從這點來說，美國縱能製造出極多的飛機，而其人材則是不能這樣簡單地培養威功的吧。在事實上，他們似乎正在相當地感着質的低下的苦悶。</p>
<p>關於賽發斯基的話，已經講完了。這裏使來開始講開撒的話吧。開撤是一個被稱為美國造船大王的人，他現在已說出了這樣的話：船無論造出多少，總要沉沒，不如放棄造船而來造飛機吧。</p>
<p>如果美國的九大造船廠一齊起來製造飛機，則每年要製造數千，不，數萬架的大型機，是極容易的事。不用船而改用大型輸送機，這對於現在正受軸心國潛艇　擊而船隻喪失非常利審的美國，是一個切實的問題。不過即使能把造船廠一律改成飛機製造廠，却也不能把鐵都變成鋁，由於道個關係，那個著名的提案，似乎就祗好暫時止於年產的五百架之議了。不過照上述的機種來說，其全備的重量爲七十噸，載運兵士一百二十五名，所以其利用價値是可認爲相當巨大的。開撒的這個提案，照例說來，固然是一個類乎過於極端之論，可是對於美國輸送機，却是非常關心的話。照最近的報紙看來，馬丁公司總理格林馬丁，恐怕已在開始大量製造馬JPBM似即較前述PBJM爲小之雙引擎機）新式大型輸送機了。緬甸雖遭封鎖，然而由空中援蔣的路，則並未歐絕。例如從印度汀斯基耶那邊到重慶的往還，是在極確實地進行着。若把汽車和飛機的速度，來作一個比較，則每架裝載十噸的飛機，如有十架在飛行着，那麼：其結果如何，便須請賢明的請君來加以推察了。</p>
<p>以上係就最近美國空軍的傾向略爲論述一二罷了。根據昨今的情報，由印度運到中國的援蔣飛機，尤其是13—14等，似乎已在開始蠢動了。</p>
<p>這裏就得回到最初所述的給論，即「有備無恐」。是以筆者希望一萬萬的國民諸君，對於航空，應該予以深切的關心，理解和擁護。（才繹）</p>

<h3>東亞經濟懇談會紀實（九）</h3>
<p>譯自卅一年十一月下旬「同盟旬報」</p>
<p>第三日　（十一月二十八日）</p>
<p>各關係局長發言要旨</p>
<p>森重—大東亞省勅傷參事官</p>
<p>哈和十一年，樹立了作爲國策的二十年百萬戶移住計劃，但正在實施第二次五年計劃之際，遭遇了火東亞戰爭之勃發。於是，和成爲當前緊急課題的國內增產强化，大和民族在圈內的分散，以及大東亞建設綫上其他的諸問題相關聯，關於旣定方策之執行，有了愼重檢討之必要。但是，考慮了大東亞防衞之北方基地强化，作爲開拓政策幅軸的滿洲之特殊性，民族融和等之後，一方面要推進滿洲開拓義勇隊的工作，同時，旣定方策之遂行，也是我們所期待的。</p>
<p>宇佐美—局長</p>
<p>華北方面，爲確保棉花及食糧增產計，首先，得謀農業生產之資材確保供給，以及農業金融之普及澈底。關於農業用資材，如肥料一項，現在是完全仰給於華中及滿洲的。在華北，窒素肥料工塲正在建設中。他如藥劑，噴霧器，農具器等，現在均由日本方面供給。但像藥劑一項，將來也許可以由南方將原料輸入，然後在華北加工製迭。農業金融，目下是通過中國聯合準備銀行而在施行的，但爲求更低利貸出計，仍有再加研究之必要。</p>
<p>（一）對於棉花收買，配給機構一元化的要求，政府雖然還沒有決定要確立這樣的機構，但配給機構實有是正之必要。這是大家都知道的，所以，關於這一點，目下正在研究中。要之，得按照現地之實情，但成最有效率的機構。</p>
<p>（二）華北一向是期待從蒙疆輸入雜穀的，但所以未能圓滑地遂行者，其原因，或說在於匯兌問題，但根本的，還在蒙疆食糧生產計劃之遲遲未有成績。因此，第一對策，是蒙疆的農業生產力實有急速地加以擴充之必要。</p>
<p>神田—商工省務局長</p>
<p>全共榮圈的產業，必須爲將來的勝戰而盡可能地集中起來，自毋庸議。因此，其重點就得放在鐵，煤，造船，輕金屬等，四大產業之迅速增產振興上，其他產業縱有被其牽制之可能，亦不得不聽其自然。船舶勞力等，也都得從這種觀點加以配置。但爲了以最低度的資材，勞力，輸送力，而圖重點產業之振興計，當地條件也有予以再檢討之必要。例如：關於鐵鑛增產：</p>
<p>（一）大東亞各地域所有的屑鐵，必須全部有組織地提供出來。</p>
<p>（二）鑒於現地鐵鑛石及煤之增產，及輪送關係之困難，在朝鮮，台灣，華北，海南島，馬來各地，均有建設小型熔鑛爐之必要。</p>
<p>（三）內地的熔鑛爐，因資材勞力等關係，能率甚低，操業亦困難，這些，不妨向適常地點予以移植，但這一點欲求立刻實現，恐怕是不可能的。</p>
<p>要之，目下必須脫離一向從用費角度米考慮當地條件的通病，像小型熔鑛爐那樣，用費雖也甚高，但國家旣有需要，我們必須期以最短期內之具體化。</p>
<p>原口—大藏省外資局長</p>
<p>大東亞物價對策之月的，正如在大東亞建設審議會中所决定的那樣，是一方面要互大東亞各地域，期以生產增强，物資交流之圓滑化，勞務之調整等，同時，爲期大東亞共榮圈建設之完成，相應于各地域之實情，民智程度，致力于其生產增强，民生安定，物資交換之圓滑化，固毋庸論，並且，爲求達到物價之健全性計，各地域物價之均衡化，也爲常務之急。但是，對各地域特殊事情加以考慮，按照一地域之不同，而劃成若干時間階段，是十分必要的。日本自中國事變以來，一直維持著所調低物價政策，一方面履行使戰時必要的生產增强，成爲可能的價格形成政策。同時，在財政，金融，產業，運輸，勞動各方面，都須期以萬全。尤其在圈內各地域，必定與日本之低物價政策相呼應，而完成戰事進行上所必要的物資交流，民生安定、絕滅各地　的價格差額，是一件非常困難的事。希望在最近的　來，　從滙兌，交易的兩側面，造成調整機構，將價格差額迅速予以調整</p>
<p>山口—商工省交易局長</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭下的物資交流乃大東亞共榮圈確立施策之一端。因此，交易的面目和性格，是完全不同的。就是說，從地域上言，僅限于東亞共榮圈內，至于其性格，爲要支持大東亞戰到底，必須凝集一切力量，站在最高目的上，轉化爲基于國家意思上之高度約計劃交易。</p>
<p>（一）和南方資源地帶之物資交流，由於諸般關係，欲求立刻完滿地實行，是頗多困難的。因此，中，日，滿，相互間之圓滑的物資交流，以東亞交易爲核心，愈益增大了牠的重要性。爲使其交易按照計劃而圓滑化起見，政府於木年一月間，以貿易統制會之結成爲契機，乃致意于交易關係機關之整頓，手續之簡單，包裝資材之配給等等。在滿，華方面，與此相呼應，也正在謀交易機構之整頓及其他許多措置。</p>
<p>（二）但是，作爲當前的交易促進策，各地域內物資之蒐集，配給，以及交易機構等，仍有改善之必要，特別是基干各地物價水準相異的交易物資之價格調整問題，必須藉統一的方法，急速予以解决才好。還有，在交易數量上，就實績看來，也並不比物資問題好多少。</p>
<p>（三）中，日，滿，各地域，生產力各有各的特色，這些特色，實有加以發揮之必要。東亞交易的前途是非常明朗的，但其航路並不十分平坦，爲求東亞計劃交易之圓滑化，特別希望各地城之積極的協力。</p>

<h3>監獄</h3>
<p>— 明月</p>
<p>坐監，在一般人看來，是倒霉的事，不幸的事　不過古今中外，有不少大人物，都曾坐過監。「囚文王於牖里」，這是大家知道的，便是一例。到了近代，各國革命運動，風起雲湧，於是志士仁人，便一批一批坐監了。因此，有人說，沒有坐過監的人，不能成功政治家。這話似嫌偏激，中庸而客觀地說，政治家坐監的機會的確比較地多，不過政治家不一定個個坐過監：而坐過監的人，也不一定個個能成功政治家。</p>
<p>政治家和監獄的關係，因爲沒有統計可以比較研究，暫且丟開。本文只就監獄本身來談談吧。</p>
<p>坐監，在我國古代稱做徒刑，現在仍稱做徒刑。坐監的痛苦，就是使人失去自由。</p>
<p>讀淸代方苞寫的獄中雜記，使人對監獄　生恐怖。在文網嚴密的淸代，方苞居然敢寫這篇文字，而且能刊布流傳，這可說不是易事，坐監的「坐」，祇要有耐性，似乎還可勉强；所吃不消的，是監獄的本身，表示侷促，汚穢·黑暗·潮濕•冷酷•殘暴的所在。村夫俗子們最怕死務進地獄；其實，何必地獄，就如方苞所寫的人間監獄，其悽慘情况，較之村夫俗子所想像的陰間地獄，有什麼差異？</p>
<p>恕我沒有考古癖，不能判斷方苞以前的監獄，比方苞所寫的，有什麼異同。恕我沒有調查機會，也不能判斷現在的監獄，比方苞所寫的，可有什麼異同。</p>
<p>勢利而狡猾的英美，不肯取消在中國的治外法權，却推托說中國的司法要改良，監獄要改善。我國監獄實况究竟怎樣，我想祇有坐過監的人，才能够知道得詳細。十年或二十年前曾坐過監的人，如果兩度或三度坐監，才能够精確比較：現在的監獄，比從前的監獄，究竟有些什麼異同。</p>
<h3>談「吃苦」與「吃虧」</h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>流光荏苒，轉瞬已三十二年開始矣，值此歲首，本「一年之計在於春」之諺語，似宜於春回大地之時，加倍努力，以奠一年之某礎，筆者不敏，自維無偉大計劃，供獻國家社會。然於此新歲來臨，旣不欲作無聊之吉語，而以上海人之好「吃」，姑談「吃」字，惟處斯動盪之大時代，百事力求刷新，對於「吃」的方面，亦當以特別改良，方足以應付環境，然則予之所謂「吃」，精選二味，而吃法更非普通之吃也，爰分述於次：</p>
<p>（一）吃苦　語云：「吃得苦中苦，方爲人上人」，是以吃苦爲吾人所當忍受的，試觀古往今來之偉人，皆由吃苦始能造就偉大事業，緣苦中含有成功之秘訣，快樂之因素，吾人苟不能吃苦，非惟難以尋求樂境，甚至一事無成！况處此時期，更應吃苦中之苦，凡事苦幹硬幹，努力不懈，而後始能獲得光明，所謂「苦盡甘來」，願與讀者共勉之。</p>
<p>（二）吃虧　吃苦旣如上述，吃虧亦為吾人所應接受，諺有：「吃虧就是便宜」比如吾人今日吃虧，明日吃虧，對方固佔盡便宜，然明眼人自能知之，決不使其吃虧到底，且吾人旣吃虧矣，尤宜研究吃虧之所在，力圖奮發，改善工作之方鍼，糾正本身之行爲，對己對人，了無愧作，縱暫時吃些小虧，其結果或反佔大便宜也</p>
<p>上列二項之吃，其上口之滋味，雖不見佳，特回味　　，如食諫果，請大衆放膽嘗試，必獲其益，最後殿以聯語一則云：「能受苦方爲志士，肯吃虧不是痴人」，望吾儕共同誌之。</p>

<h3>赫胥黎論人類不死問題　—世界著名科學家的書翰之一</h3>
<p>— Lincoln　Schuster　古心　著譯</p>
<p>我很知道，我的朋友中有百分之九十九要稱我爲無神者，耶敎徒，以及其他通常使人難堪的名字。按照我們的法律所取的立塲，如果最下流的賊偷了我的衣服，我的證詞（我的意見雖然人所共知）就不會被接受，而對他有所不利。</p>
<p>但是我管不了這些。有一件事人們是不會公平地來稱呼我的，那就是——一個說謊者。正如你說到你自己那樣，我也覺得我缺少勇氣；不過如果時機居然來到而使我不得不說話時，我是不會使我的孩子蒙羞的。</p>
<p>我現在對你說話，除了我的妻子以外，從未對於個人說得如此坦白與淸楚。</p>
<p>如果你能指出我在前提上或結論上有什麼錯誤，我準備放棄這些話，正如我也會放棄任何其他的學說一樣。不過不論怎樣，你要對我公平，相信我沒有注意到這些問題的重要性，因此還沒有達到結論的地步。</p>
<p>我這封信是格外欣然地寫給你的，因爲我很知道，如果那對於善與惡很有力量的大工具，英國敎會，要得以保存，不至被科學的前進潮流打得粉碎，——這是我很抱憾地要看見的事實，不過像牛津的撒母耳（Samnel　Oxford）那樣的人能够對於她的前途加以指導，這種事實就一定不會發生了——那末，像你那樣的人就必須加以努力，使敎會的實用和科學的精神聯合起來。你要明白，我所熟悉的年輕科學家，都完全和我一樣想法。（我知道在他們意面沒有一個專事嘲弄的人，也沒有一個無宗敎性或者不道德的人，你是他們對於正敎的觀念，正如你對於婆羅門敎一樣。）你要明白，這個新的先知學派是　作出奇跡來的惟一學派，也是能够時常訴諸自然而尋求正確證據的惟一學派，而你也必須想到，要想用敎士的闊邊帽和圍裙來阻磯我們，或者說我們的學說是「駭人聽聞的，」都是無用的。</p>
<p>我不敢承認說，我懂得你自己，毛立斯（Maurice），和你這一派其他諸人的邏輯，不過我曾時常說過，我要藉着你的忠信與誠實起誓，你的努力必定能够獲得善果。然而這事對我愈淸楚，就愈可以見出其必要，必要使你看見科學家所在努力的地方，我的心裏早就要寫這樣的信給你。</p>
<p>如果什麼地方我說得太坦率了，或者太唐突了，請你原諒我，並且請你同樣對我說。</p>
<p>我妻很謝謝你送給她的演講集。——永遠對你很忠誠的。</p>

<p>後果　湯麥司·赫胥黎淸楚而勇敢的發揮，已成了古典的言論，可以看出科學家尋求眞理時的態度，那是趨向自由的詢問和不受拘束的探究的態度。這封信寫了之後，在赫胥黎的家庭中又添了一個兒子，使那個抱喪子之痛的母親得到了一些安慰。（本篇完）</p>
<h3>歷代名瓷展覽</h3>
<p>— 黃肇平</p>
<p>我國瓷器，素在世界藝術史上佔有地位，顧歷代製作，年更歲遠，傳者日少，收藏家偶有所獲，往往珍同瓖寶，不輕示人。梁溪海天屢主戴潤齋氏，研究我國瓷器，垂二十餘年，鑑別精審，收藏豐富，卓然爲一大名家。茲將其生平所藏·晋·唐·宋·元·明·淸歷代名瓷，在靜安寺路九九六號美琪大廈公開展覽一星期，其間頗多稀世珍品，為外間所不易經見者，其藝術公開之精神，良堪嘉佩。</p>
<p>展覽品中，頗多晋代越窰製器。考我國歷代名窰，見於載籍者，實以晋東甌窰為最古，故陳列諸品，極爲名貴。次為陳之昌南，即今馳譽世界之景德鎮窰也。唐代中，當以越窰爲最，邢窰次之。五代除越窰秘色器外，柴窰爲獨著。北宋名窰最多，如定·鈞·東·汝·官·龍泉·哥弟諸窰所製者，古樸精雅，並皆可愛。元代彭窰製器，爲彭均寶於霍州燒製者，效法定器，亦屬佳品。明淸兩代中，則當推鎭窰製器爲獨多。</p>
<p>彩瓷以明淸兩代爲大觀，明永樂所製者，當以半脫胎甜白爲最，花文錐拱之法，實爲始創，祭紅亦爲前所未有，惟終覺鮮紅者爲可貴。宜德之寶石紅及霽靑，正德之回靑拗，並皆著名。嘉靖之礬紅，允推一代特色。萬曆新瓷，色澤濃艷，畫手荒率，似亦頗具自然之致，未可全非。有淸一代，康雍乾三朝御窰製器，美備精良，超邁往古，如康熙朝之臧窰郎窰，雍正之年窰，因其時正當全盛，物力富裕，工事精良，所製並皆美妙。乾降官窰，經唐英督造，其人博學多識，匠心獨運，所製無不精工絕倫，而彩繪之精妙，尤有繼往開來之功，粉彩無異寫生，亦屬獨開生面，大抵三朝名彩，康熙以鮮紅者爲最，而天靑，翠靑，嬌黃，粉黃及吹紅，吹紫，吹青，吹綠，尤美。青花五彩，繼軋明之宣成，更屬有過無不及。琺瑯彩器，雖肇於臧窰，而唐英取藍勝藍，尤爲絕詣。故觀淸瓷者，率以唐英之際，爲官窰發達之全盛時代，良有由也。</p>
<p>此次展覽之歷代名瓷，分列四大室，依時代之演變，工事之精進，作一有系統之介紹，非特發揚先民創作之精神，抑亦表顯歷代文物之演進，意義頗爲深長，各界對於不易一見之稀世珍品，幸勿交臂失之。</p>

<p>威葛特夫人所租給他的是一個小而舒適並且充滿陽光的房間。屋子的本身是難看到不成其爲屋子的。不過這也沒有什麼關係。牠是便利的——這是主要的事情。因爲，如果天氣溫和，他喜歡在一個下午，漫步過去，到運動塲上去看學生們遊戲。他喜歡對學生們笑笑，交談幾句，學生們則對他舉手觸帽作禮。他一定要認識所有的新學生，因此在他們到校的第一學期，他就請他們來喝茶。他時常向村莊上雷台惠（Reddaway）的店裏定製一蒸胡桃糕，上面蓋着粉紅色的冰糖，在下學期，也有鬆脆的烤餅——在火爐前堆成了小小的一堆，用奶油浸着，以致底下的一個就好像放在一個小小的淺池中。他的客人覺得看他弄茶是有趣的事情—從不同的茶罐裏，小心地一匙一匙配合起來。他會問問那些新學生，他們住在那裏，他們和勃洛克菲爾德有沒有親族的關係。他一直留心着，使他們的盒子裏水遠不空，經了一小時之後；一到五點鐘，他就會對鐘看看，然後說：「唔—呃吁—這樣和你們在一起—呃哼—很愉快，可惜—呃哼—你們不能再多留一刻了。…」他會笑笑，和他們在門廊裏握着手，讓他們一面批評着一面奔過大路到學校裏去。「還算好的老孩子，吉普斯。不論怎樣，他給你一頓開心的好茶　，而且你的確知道，什麼時候他要你滾蛋。…」社會服務</p>

<h3>On Participation in the War</h3>
<p>According to recent news: the National Government is about to decide to participate in the war. This is the first major event of the thirty-second year of the Republic.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of the people, before a nation's policy is determined, the people should have the right to speak. However, once the national policy has been decided, the people have nothing to say except to support it. This time, the National Government is about to decide to participate in the war, which at least feels sudden to us, the people. Therefore, we did not have the opportunity to offer advice to the government. Now that participation in the war is about to become national policy, we can only support the national policy.</p>
<p>Why are we participating in the war at this time? What are the meaning, purpose, and tasks of participating in the war? What should we, the people, do after participating in the war? The government must have conducted thorough research and preparations beforehand, and will certainly issue a clear announcement to the people immediately. There is no need for further speculation here.</p>
<p>The issue that we, the people, are most concerned about is what will happen after participating in the war? We dare to sincerely offer two suggestions to those in authority:</p>
<p>First, respect the will of the military and the people. Participating in the war is a national policy, with secret strategic implications. It may not be possible to solicit public opinion beforehand. However, now that participating in the war has been confirmed as national policy, all subsequent steps and measures, how to concentrate human and material resources, how to implement a wartime system, how to enhance international cooperation, all matters related to the future of the country and the nation and the lives of the people, must extensively solicit public opinion and must obtain the full understanding of the people. We do not hesitate to repeat that the people are the most important and ultimate determining force. The ultimate implementation of national policy, the implementation and realization of all policies and decrees, will not be successfully promoted or completed without the people's spontaneous, active participation and support. If you do not want national policy to be separate from the people, the two not in coordination, then everything from now on must widely adopt public opinion, broadly solicit public sentiment, and especially give full play to the power of the people. Only by respecting public opinion in this way can national policy be realized and victory be achieved.</p>
<p>Second, maintain national strength and the vitality of the nation. We know that the government's past advocacy of peace was a peace with positive significance, and its ultimate goal was to maintain the lifeline of the nation. Today's participation in the war, since it is not a negation of the past peace movement, but a more active pursuit of the realization of peace in a new world order, its ultimate goal is still to maintain the survival of the nation. Therefore, we must not only seek to fully develop national strength, but also fully cultivate and cherish it. For example, in the past, under the Chongqing regime, everything from the conscription of able-bodied men to the collection of materials disrupted society and endangered the lives of the people, weakening national strength and depleting national vitality. We hope that this kind of phenomenon will not occur in the peaceful areas after participating in the war.</p>
<h3>National Government Decides on Supreme Policy: Sino-Japanese Cooperation Further Strengthened; Relations Between the Two Countries Enter a New Stage: Observations from Japanese Political Circles</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Sino-Japanese cooperative relations have become increasingly strengthened since the visit to Japan by Chairman Wang of the National Government. It is expected that there will be even more rapid progress this year. Regarding the trends of a new stage in Sino-Japanese relations, according to人士 from political circles here, Chairman Wang of the National Government visited our country shortly after the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, which is sufficient to show the supreme policy of the National Government authorities. It is of great importance to us that China and Japan form an East Asian axis and cooperate in all aspects to complete the Greater East Asia War. On specific issues of Sino-Japanese cooperation, it seems that the opinions of the two countries are completely一致. This point can be clearly seen from Chairman Wang's speech in Tokyo on December 22 of last year. We believe that the National Government's resolute adoption of this supreme policy, in this second year of the Greater East Asia War and at a crucial moment when the fate of the entire East Asia will be determined, we naturally expect the National Government to make new developments in some form. That is, Chairman Wang also said in a broadcast speech to the Japanese people in Tokyo on December 25 of last year, "I think the coming year will be a year for your country to ensure the great achievements gained since the Greater East Asia War, and also a year for your country to continue to win the Greater East Asia War and achieve its completion." This explains that this year is the year of决战. Secondly, he also expressed his firm determination that the National Government will promote spiritual mobilization and military-economic preparations to assist in the completion of the Greater East Asia War, and move from sharing weal and woe to sharing life and death. The comradeship and unity of the entire East Asian nation will surely win the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. In the Chairman's statement, it is clearly stated that the National Government has, through the Greater East Asia War, moved from its original position in the rear to the front line. The New National Movement is to complete the spiritual mobilization system, establish the currency system through central reserve certificates, and also prepare and improve industrial economy, and prepare and replenish the army, all of which are regarded as preparations for implementing the cooperative system. After Chairman Wang and his party returned to China, the National Government, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, promoted the National Government's supreme policy and cooperated to complete the Greater East Asia War. We deeply admire this. For example, the Shanghai New China News recently pointed out in an editorial commemorating the fourth anniversary of Chairman Wang's发表艳, that the National Government's return to the capital was the first leap forward, the alliance between China, Japan, and Manchuria was the second leap forward, the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and the sharing of weal and woe was the third leap forward, and now it is about to make the fourth leap forward. It also stated that four years have passed since the发表艳, and we have completed the preparations for sharing weal and woe and further entered the front line of the Greater East Asia War, and are determined to make an extraordinary struggle with friendly nations to share life and death, and are determined to prepare all forces to win the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. This development of the fourth leap forward is of decisive significance to the construction history of the New China. This can be said to have reflected the public opinion of the Chinese people, and they deeply hope that the Sino-Japanese cooperative system will have new developments.</p>

<h3>Roosevelt's Special Envoy Arrives in Karachi; Food Panic in India; People Fall into Famine</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 8th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Today's news: Philip, President Roosevelt's personal envoy to India, has arrived in Karachi.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - Since the Governor-General of India disregarded the hardships of the people and requisitioned a large amount of food for military use, the entire territory of India has suffered an unprecedented food panic. According to a recent report by the New York Times correspondent in New Delhi, the people in India are currently in famine due to the lack of major food such as wheat, rice, and corn. The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, seeing the seriousness of the situation, has begun to attack the Indian Governor-General's Office. In short, the current food shortage has become the most serious problem for the Indian people. Although the Indian Governor-General's Office has begun to find ways to solve the Indian food panic, it is not easy to solve the situation due to the activities of the National Congress Party. In addition, at a time when the prices of rice, flour, and general food products are rising, not to mention farmers, even general food stores are unwilling to sell, so the situation of having to buy at high prices has occurred. Ordinary food products are also not on the market. According to last year's harvest, except for one place in Bengal, the overall results were quite good, but the supply of sugar was poor in the market due to riots and other reasons in that area. In the past, India's daily rice supply relied on Myanmar and Indochina, importing about one million to one and a half million tons each year. Now that this source has been cut off, it is a major cause of the current food panic in India. In addition, although Indian rice can be harvested at the end of January, wheat cannot be on the market until May. How will the people of India overcome the difficulties in this time of scarcity? It is a serious problem. Also, the London Economic Weekly has also reported from Calcutta about the current food panic in India. It is said that the issue of implementing price controls in India has caused great concern in the Indian economic community, because there are many obstacles to implementing fixed prices for general major food products, which has led to the failure of the Indian Governor-General's Office's policy of implementing price controls. Also, the prices of general high-quality food products have risen greatly and are arbitrarily traded privately, making it very difficult for the general Indian people to obtain the food they are entitled to.</p>
<h3>Population Increase in Syonan Island</h3>
<p>Syonan, 8th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - The population survey of Syonan Island, as of the end of last year, estimated a total of 769,000 people, an increase of about 10,000 people compared to the total population of Singapore before the war (January 30th year of the Republic), which was 760,000.</p>
<h3>Order Stable in Romania</h3>
<p>Budapest, 8th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Romanian Prime Minister General Antonescu met with cabinet members and the Chief of Staff on his name day and delivered a speech stating that Romania's order is stable today, and that the order in Romania is not maintained by bayonets and bullets, but by the rationality of the people. This is enough to prove that the Romanian people are full of responsibility, and everyone should now fulfill their responsibilities to achieve the goal of victory.</p>

<p>Medical Common Sense</p>
<h3>Common Ailments of Young People: Hyperacidity; Not Suitable to Recklessly Use Alkaline Neutralizing Agents; Should Fundamentally Strengthen the Stomach and Intestines</h3>
<p>Two or three hours after a meal, heartburn and acid regurgitation occur. However, pressing the stomach with the hand stops the pain, and water or food entering the stomach naturally eliminates the pain—such symptoms are symptoms of hyperacidity. According to medical statistics, patients with hyperacidity, those aged 31 to 40 account for 30% of the total, those aged 21 to 30 and 41 to 50 each account for 22%. In short, more than 70% of the total are young people with vigorous blood. Especially those薪俸阶级人</p>
<p>The number of hyperacidity cases has increased significantly in recent years, which is a matter of great concern. In addition, it is not because they work at their desks all day, have no time to exercise, and are not suitable for health maintenance.</p>
<p>Because this disease does not cause severe pain, it is often taken lightly. However, specialized doctors pay close attention to it, because this disease is often inverted, that is, it resembles hyperacidity, but in fact there are quite a few cases of hypoacidity, and this disease is most likely to cause gastric ulcers, duodenal ulcers, and diabetes. From this, the complexity and danger of this disease can be generally seen. So how to treat this disease? In terms of medication, the most commonly used is the曹剤. Because this medicine is alkaline, it has the effect of neutralizing stomach acid, but on the one hand, its effect is temporary and it is easy to become a habit.</p>
<p>In this sense, what I would like to recommend is completely different from chemical preparations. Its efficacy exerts what is called the cell protoplasm activation effect, and has a positive therapeutic effect on the source of the disease. Therefore, whether it is hyperacidity or hypoacidity, if you take this medicine, the abnormal gastric acid secretion function can return to normal, and the acidity in the stomach will naturally be regulated. As for gastric ulcers, because it regenerates healthy cells due to its ulceration, the symptoms naturally lighten. This medicine not only has the great effect of treating the disease from its source, but also does not cause any side effects, and it does not become a habit even with continuous use, so it is safest to take.</p>

<h3>German Army Shortens Caucasus Defense Line According to Planned Schedule; Main Force in Southern Stalingrad Makes Contact; Stalemate in Middle Reaches of Don River</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - Military officials here said last night that the German army on the Eastern Front, while resisting the Soviet army's attack, is withdrawing from some forward positions in the eastern Caucasus according to a planned schedule to shorten and strengthen the defense line. This military operation has been quietly carried out for several days, and only now has the Red Army authorities noticed it. The Red Army is taking advantage of the opportunity to launch a fierce attack with a large number of tank units, but all have been contained.</p>
<p>Bern, 8th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - According to消息 from the Eastern Front, there are battles along the railway line of Kotelnikovo-Salsk. The Soviet side said that its troops are advancing, but also admitted that the German army's resistance is extremely strong. The Soviet army in the south of Stalingrad has made contact with the main force of the German army and is engaged in fierce battles.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 8th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - According to消息 from the Eastern Front, the offensive and defensive battles between the German and Soviet armies on the Eastern Front have, since the 6th, rapidly shifted to the vicinity of Kotelnikovo, southwest of Stalingrad, and the areas of Pyatigorsk and Prokhladny in the central Caucasus. The German army is constantly reinforcing the front line with a large number of infantry and tank units and launching offensives everywhere. The Soviet Information Bureau frankly admitted that the German army's defense on this front has been strengthened. Currently, the German army's counterattack is most fierce in the vicinity of Kotelnikovo. It concentrated the main force of mechanized units southeast of the city at dawn on the 6th and launched a continuous fierce attack, engaging in a fierce tank battle with the Soviet mechanized units. It is also reported that the German army in the northwest of Stalingrad has, after a fierce battle, broken into the Soviet army's positions and is advancing all the way forward. In the middle reaches of the Don River, the Soviet army's combat power seems to have been somewhat reduced due to the wind and snow in recent days. Except for the German army's local counterattacks on the entire line, it is in a state of stalemate. In addition, in the central Caucasus, it is reported that the German and Soviet armies are currently engaged in a large-scale encounter battle on a 150-kilometer long front in the areas of Mineralnye Vody, Pyatigorsk, and Prokhladny. The Soviet army is using cavalry units as the main force and launching offensives from the east and west sides of Mineralnye Vody and Nalchik. According to消息 from Moscow, the Soviet army has recovered more than ten villages on the 7th, but according to the German side, the Soviet army's counterattack has been crushed.</p>
<h3>North African War Enters Second Stage; Commander-in-Chief of German Forces in Tunisia Replaced; Battle for Mateur Becomes More Intense</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Military experts here said that the British and American forces failed to achieve their expected goals after fighting in North Africa for two months. Now, Tunisia and Bizerte have become fortresses of the Axis powers. This is the military situation of the North African war entering the second stage. General Arnim has now been appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the German forces in Tunisia. Arnim is now fifty-two years old and has extremely rich combat experience. He repeatedly made outstanding achievements in the Polish campaign.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - According to消息 from the front line, the battle for the high ground west of Mateur in the Tunisian war has now become intense. Both sides are successively increasing their forces and launching a heroic land and air battle with the cooperation of the air force. Currently, the center of the battle is on several high grounds west of Mateur, and the intersection of the highway from Tunisia to Mateur and the highway from southern Tunisia to the western coast. The two armies are currently engaged in a deadly battle for the above strongholds. After reinforcements from the anti-Axis army arrived, the main force of the British infantry units and commando units have been guarding the high ground on both sides of the highway intersections since the 5th. However, the German army still braved British artillery fire and British air force bombing and launched a brave assault, and by the evening of the 6th, they had driven back the British army and occupied the two high grounds. According to消息 from London, the British military authorities also admitted that the anti-Axis army is in an extremely unfavorable state in the Tunisian war.</p>
<p>Bern, 7th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - It has been reported from the央国 and Axis countries that the battles on the Libyan front were slightly more intense yesterday. According to消息 from Rome, the British scout teams are very active in the western雨特区, and their repeated attacks have been repelled.</p>
<h3>Suffering in Libyan Operations Due to Wind, Sand, Mosquitoes, Flies, and Lack of Drinking Water</h3>
<p>Bern, 7th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - A German reporter coming from North Africa said that the German army fighting in the Libyan desert must not only deal with the enemy, but also cope with difficulties such as wind, sandstorms, mosquitoes, flies, and lack of drinking water. Therefore, when it is scorching hot, the "Gibli" follows. The so-called "Gibli" is a hot, sandy wind from the south. It is most violent from November to March every year. Before the sand waves arrive, strange clouds first obscure the setting sun. The color of the sun is often abnormal, changing from bright red to yellow. After the sun sets, the night is calm and uneventful. At dawn the next day, a storm suddenly rises, with flying sand and rocks. The residents' clothes, bread, and various foods in the mobile kitchen are all covered by yellow sand. Residents do not go out unless necessary, and lie quietly in their tents wearing sand goggles. However, there are also those who go out to fight when the "Gibli" occurs. Because the line of sight is unclear, they can only see the person coming within ten yards, so the two sides often fight within ten yards. Those with strong nerves and agile movements often win. This is sufficient to cope with any crisis in the well-trained German army. This kind of wind and sand comes fiercely, and its disappearance also stops abruptly. The metal parts of various objects and the human body are all charged with electricity due to the friction with the sand particles. When a person's hand touches a car door handle or two people shake hands, it often seems like an electric shock and is startled. Less than ten minutes after the wind and sand stop, the cold waves from the northern ocean, the "Gabi", blow the sand back to the desert. Although the "Gabi" can disperse the heat of the sand, the unpleasant feeling it gives people is no less than that of the "Gibli". When the strong wind stops, there is another unpleasant thing, that is, flies gather and fill the air, making people's lives quite unpleasant. In addition, drinking water in the desert is also one of the most important issues. There is no fresh drinking water between Tripoli and Derna, and it must be transported by water collectors and distributed by the military command. Those who waste drinking water, even a drop, will be severely punished. The difficulty of drinking water can be imagined from this.</p>

<h3>格魯再度 警告國人 日本實力未可侮</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Allied News Agency) - Philadelphia, USA dispatch: Former US Ambassador to Japan, Joseph Grew, warned Americans that Japan's national strength is formidable and that we cannot assume we can defeat them with a limited war.  In such a stalemate, Japan will only strengthen its power.  If we believe that Japan can be defeated as easily as smashing rotten wood after Hitler is defeated, this misjudgment plays into Japan's psychological military strategy.  In essence, we must actively attack Japan before they can consolidate their occupied territories by utilizing time, only then can we defeat them.</p>
<h3>Northwest Transportation</h3>
<p>January 5th, Macau dispatch</p>
<p>Countless vehicles travel the Sichuan-Shaanxi highway day and night, naturally damaging the road surface. Some sections are practically impassable.</p>
<p>The Sichuan highway from Shishi to Chengdu is comparatively more dilapidated, especially the section from Guangyuan to Zizi, where accidents frequently occur. Many bridges are also in disrepair, making driving on them frightening. On the Jianmen Pass road, with rain falling, the road surface turned entirely into muddy yellow clay. Jianmen Pass is a notoriously dangerous road, and accidents often happen even when the weather is clear. Our car barely made it up the slope and luckily descended it. Just after descending the steepest slope, we saw two or three road workers spreading yellow earth, and the passengers were delighted to be able to walk on a dry road for a while. However, they started pouring water while spreading the earth. With the rain falling incessantly and the water being poured continuously, the road became even more difficult to travel. What kind of road repair is this?</p>
<p>The ferries at Guangyuan and Mianyang are poorly equipped, while the Neijiang ferry is comparatively better. Northwest transportation is frequent, but the road surface, bridges, slopes, ferries, and fords have not been repaired and improved.</p>
<h3>Random Talks on the Solomon Islands</h3>
<p>— Cangsheng</p>
<p>In the mid-16th century, China was enjoying the prosperous Ming Dynasty. Western European countries adhered to mercantilism, actively seeking overseas colonies. At that time, a Spanish navigator named Mendana discovered the Solomon Islands in the scorching equatorial south in 1567. Believing he had found the origin of the gold from King Solomon's temple in Jerusalem, he gave it the current name. The name "Solomon Islands" symbolizes mercantilism in the economy since the Middle Ages, and a story of European imperialism extending outward for centuries.</p>
<p>The Solomon Islands consist of nine large islands and sixteen small islands, bordering the Coral Sea to the southeast and approaching New Britain Island to the northwest, stretching for 1,275 miles. The southern part has been under British territory for over fifty years. After the last European war, the northern part was transferred from Germany to the United Kingdom. The total area of the islands is 14,600 square miles. Before the Japanese occupation, there were 500 white people, 200 Chinese, and about 10,000 local indigenous people with frizzy hair. Previously, many natives were taken by white people to nearby islands to be used as slaves. They were so angry that they burned, killed, and ate white people's flesh and skin as a ritual, hoping to comfort the souls of those who died as slaves.</p>
<p>In the southeast of these islands is Florida Island, and next to it is Tulagi, a small island only two miles long. Because Florida Island acts as a barrier, it is not affected by tropical hurricanes, and its shape is very similar to the British Scapa Flow naval base. During the last European war, British Admiral Jellicoe said it was the best eastern port in the Pacific Ocean and could hide the entire British fleet. Guadalcanal to the south has flat terrain in the north, which can be used to build airfields. Malaita Island to the north is entirely farmland and can protect the Tulagi naval base.</p>
<p>After the Solomon Islands were occupied by Japan, the most threatened was the route from the United States to Europe and Australia. This route is the only hope for protecting Europe. From Honolulu to Sydney, Australia, it is about 6,700 miles and must pass through New Caledonia. However, that island is only 1,100 miles from Tulagi and is greatly threatened by Japanese planes and naval forces. Port Moresby (890 miles from Tulagi) was already in imminent danger. Sydney (1,800 miles from Tulagi) and Darwin could be threatened by Japanese naval and air forces at any moment.</p>
<p>Admiral King, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy, issued a public statement on August 10 saying that operations were very difficult and heavy losses were inevitable, but such combat experience would be very useful in the future.</p>
<p>Landing tactics in front of the enemy are commonplace for the Japanese. In the United States, it is a great surprise, and the whole country tells each other as if shocked by electricity, as if it were a major difficulty.</p>
<p>The U.S. Marines are divided into two units. Those on the East Coast are called the Atlantic Marine Corps, headquartered in North Carolina, and those on the West Coast are called the Pacific Marine Corps, headquartered in California.</p>
<h3>US Giant Aircraft Bombs Palermo Harbor, Italy Civilians Killed and Wounded Exceed 300</h3>
<p>Rome, 8th (Haitong News Agency) - The Italian Command announced that four-engine US aircraft dropped many bombs on the port and urban area of Palermo yesterday, destroying several houses and causing many civilian casualties. Currently, it is known that 40 people have died and 262 have been injured. Licata was also hit with incendiary bombs, with slight damage to houses and only one resident injured.</p>
<h3>Assassin of Darlan Named Chappelle, a Pro-Gorgul Youth</h3>
<p>Vichy, 8th (Allied News Agency) - After learning the name and identity of Darlan's assassin, the French government will announce it soon. According to well-informed sources, the assassin's name is Chappelle, a student of the Gorgul faction.</p>
<p>Vichy, 8th (Haitong News Agency) - It is learned here that the assassin of Darlan has been revealed. He is Chappelle, the son of a sports editor and reporter for the Alger Republicain in Algeria. This secret was revealed inside the US military camp in Algiers. It is heard that British representative to French North Africa, Macmillan, has protested to US representative Murphy, blaming the US for such negligence. It is learned that the assassin's mother is Jewish. Because she was involved in pro-Gorgul activities, her family was under surveillance by the local police before the American invasion of North Africa. Chappelle was only twenty years old when he was sentenced to death.</p>
<h3>US Troops Land on Falkland Islands, South America, Argentina Deeply Shocked</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 7th (Havas Agency) - Political circles here are deeply shocked by the news of the US troops landing in the Falkland Islands to "cooperate with the British army in jointly defending this territory." Some newspapers stated that Argentina would hardly condone this action, as "this is a special concept of Pan-Americanism." According to reports, this group of islands is located off the coast of Argentina and was occupied by the British in 1834. South Americans call them the Islas Malvinas, while the British later renamed them the Falkland Islands, but Argentina still considers this its territory and has never recognized the British occupation of the islands. Therefore, it is often a matter discussed between the governments of the two countries. In 1934, on the 100th anniversary of the British occupation of the islands, Argentina issued commemorative stamps with a national map on the stamp face, still including the Falkland Islands within its territory. It is said that there are only 2,500 residents on the islands.</p>

<h3>US Air Force Reorganization After Defeat</h3>
<p>Two Topics</p>
<p>By Lieutenant Colonel Kinoshita Shunjiro, Member of the Army Aviation Headquarters, translated from "Aviation Culture", December 1941</p>
<p>The same sentence can produce vastly different feelings and unexpected results depending on the skillfulness of the expression or the different methods of presentation.</p>
<p>The topic assigned to me here is "About the US Air Force." Under these important circumstances, if it causes results that are not expected by the author, the responsibility cannot but be said to be very serious. Therefore, I would like to state the conclusion of this article first.</p>
<p>In a word, we should "not fear a large enemy, and not be arrogant to a small enemy." Although the enemy was defeated in the initial battle of this war, their underlying national strength is quite large, so we should not be intoxicated with the victory of the initial battle and harbor arrogance towards the enemy.</p>
<p>However, we do not need to harbor fear of their vast military strength and productivity. Needless to say, we must accurately recognize the current situation and have full preparation to deal with the enemy.</p>
<p>Currently, the Japanese are excessively overjoyed and shouting "Victory, Victory!" If there are still those who hold the view that the war has already overcome the difficulties, that is truly absurd. It must be understood that the war has only just begun, that is, it has only just begun to reach one stage. The next stage is a very difficult stage of refining us!</p>
<p>First, while Japan is shouting "Victory! Victory!", the United States is not thinking "Defeat! Defeat!" With their territory, the United States losing only one corner of East Asia does not seem to feel much pain. Because they have not had time to prepare for military equipment. Imagine how wealthy the United States may be, can they simply take on the heavy task of being the world's weapons issuing center, while still fully taking care of their own share? However, from the gradual realization of Roosevelt's massive military expansion plan, it can be concluded that the counterattack against Japan in 1943 is also being gradually realized.  Regarding aircraft, 60,000 in 1942 and 125,000 in 1943, the number is so large that it is worthy of being called an astronomical figure. When such a huge number was announced, their parliament, in shock, clamored and applauded. It is said that one of the parliamentarians even whistled from his mouth, which would surprise Americans, so the scale can be imagined.</p>
<p>In short, the United States has suffered its first severe blow and now seems to be retreating temporarily to calmly reorganize and prepare to come out again.</p>
<p>That being said, it seems that the United States is very calm and composed, but that is not the case. The Japanese have always held the argument that "the United States is a country of mixed races, and its interior will soon collapse." Recently, this argument has disappeared, which is indeed something worth noting. Observations based on hope are often confused with assumptions or predictions. Now, it is said that "Remember Pearl Harbor" is popular in the United States. Pearl Harbor seems to be a painful thing for them, and the unexpectedly revealed revenge is not to be ignored, not to mention that Roosevelt, this great ambitious man, must deeply know the weaknesses and shortcomings of the American people. Recently, almost all American automobile factories, including the Ford factory, have been converted into aircraft factories. Their clever methods, even the enemy cannot help but praise. Now, it is said that no civilian cars are being manufactured in the United States. At the beginning of the war, Roosevelt strengthened the restrictions on the use of rubber, and at that time, all parties seemed to have complaints about it, but now, this kind of complaint is no longer heard everywhere. Now, from their rubber reserves, artificial rubber, recycled rubber, and rubber trees planted in South America, it can be known that they are ensuring a considerable necessary amount. The US government and the American people are very serious. If they still mix Yankee and Monkey together, just like they call me (Japan) Jap and treat it as a barbaric country.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I would like to raise two questions from the recent newspapers. That is, Seversky's thesis and Kaiser's proposal. It is worth noting that these two kinds of arguments occurred in the United States.</p>
<p>Major Seversky, originally from the Soviet Union, is the author of "Victory Through Air Power", the most widely sold book in the United States recently. The content of the book, in a nutshell, is: "If the United States does not greatly increase its air force, it cannot defeat Japan." He said, "The United States must reform its concept of the army, navy, and air force. No matter how much the navy is expanded, even if the Japanese fleet can be destroyed, if the Japanese air force still exists, then it is impossible to land on the Japanese mainland, let alone bomb the Japanese mainland. The United States should use most of its military expansion budget to manufacture aircraft, so that by 1945, it will be able to take formal offensive action against Japan." He also said: "Rather than building ships, it is better to build large airships and aircraft. With Martin-style airships and Douglas BI19 aircraft, it is very easy to take off from the Aleutians and bomb Tokyo back and forth." The Martin PB2M airship and the Douglas BI19 aircraft are said to have a range of 13,000 kilometers, so even if they take off from Dutch Harbor, they can fly to Tokyo, where the round trip is only about 8,000 kilometers. However, it is impossible to implement this plan early. Because the above two were only trial-manufactured last year, and then their whereabouts were hidden somewhere. However, these are all manufactured specifically for the experimental research of large aircraft. From many debates about this matter, it is possible that a part of them has already moved into the mass production process.</p>
<p>Although Seversky's above argument is not very novel, he also said something admirable, that is, he pointed out that "American aircraft are the worst among the great powers." This sounds a bit neurotic, but among Americans, there are people who say such things, and their books are so widely purchased by the people. From this point of view, we also need to consider it. American aviation industry and aviation technology have always been considered to be on par with Germany and selected as the highest level in the world. In fact, it does have the strength that can be recognized. But to say that "American aircraft are insignificant" is not like talking nonsense? However, with the progress of the Greater East Asia War, seeing American aircraft being shot down one by one by Japanese aircraft in various places in the south, I am afraid that they are indeed seriously thinking like this. However, looking back at what the Japanese people are thinking! It is known that they have already begun to boast that "Japanese aircraft are the best in the world." This is truly the most chilling thing. Japanese aircraft are indeed quite good in performance, but they cannot boast that they are the best in the world. The imperfection and lack of quantity of aircraft are compensated by the ability of our aviation unit. Relying on the remaining compensation, and defeating the enemy, this is the real fact. Japanese technicians have always trusted the performance of American aircraft and have always wanted to catch up with them. However, judging from the performance of the enemy aircraft obtained from capture and other reasons, it is somewhat inferior to their propaganda. They completely rely on catalog samples to promote the performance of their aircraft in order to sell them to other countries. If you see through this point, you will regret it too late. If our technicians are really fooled by the catalog samples they presented, then there is no shame in exposing their masks and manufacturing aircraft in a down-to-earth manner. Now, if you have a sense of pride here, then our country cannot help but commit the great mistake of sacrificing human life for machines. Therefore, our country only recognizes that its aircraft are far inferior to the great powers, and strives for its progress and development.</p>
<p>Here, the question of ability arises. We can at least publicly declare that our elite air force is truly one aircraft equivalent to a thousand, and in order to concentrate the elite of one aircraft equivalent to a thousand in the air in the future, we deeply feel that we must absorb those with excellent qualifications into the air force from the beginning. Jade cannot emit light if it is not polished, but if it is originally a stone, then no matter how hard you polish it, you cannot polish out any luster. From this point of view, even if the United States can manufacture a large number of aircraft, its talents cannot be cultivated so simply. In fact, they seem to be feeling quite distressed about the decline in quality.</p>
<p>I have finished talking about Seversky's words. Here, let's start talking about Kaiser's words. Kaiser is a person known as the American shipbuilding king. He has now said this: No matter how many ships are built, they will always sink, so it is better to give up shipbuilding and build aircraft.</p>
<p>If the nine major shipyards in the United States start manufacturing aircraft together, it is very easy to manufacture thousands, no, tens of thousands of large aircraft every year. Replacing ships with large transport aircraft is a practical issue for the United States, which is now suffering from the losses of ships attacked by Axis submarines. However, even if all shipyards can be converted into aircraft manufacturing plants, they cannot turn iron into aluminum. Due to this relationship, that famous proposal seems to have to be temporarily limited to the production of 500 units per year. However, according to the aforementioned model, its fully equipped weight is 70 tons and it carries 125 soldiers, so its utilization value can be considered quite huge. Kaiser's proposal, as usual, is indeed a somewhat extreme argument, but it is very concerned about American transport aircraft. According to recent newspapers, Glenn Martin, the president of the Martin Company, is probably already starting to mass-produce the Martin JPBM-like (smaller than the aforementioned PBJM dual-engine aircraft) new large transport aircraft. Although Burma is blocked, the road to aid Chiang Kai-shek from the air has not been cut off. For example, the round trip from Tinsukia in India to Chongqing is being carried out very reliably. If we compare the speed of cars and aircraft, if ten aircraft, each carrying ten tons, are flying, then: what will be the result, please ask the wise gentlemen to speculate.</p>
<p>The above is just a brief discussion of the recent trends of the US Air Force. According to the information from yesterday and today, the aircraft for aiding Chiang Kai-shek transported from India to China, especially 13-14, etc., seem to have begun to stir.</p>
<p>Here, we must return to the conclusion mentioned at the beginning, that is, "preparedness eliminates fear." Therefore, I hope that 100 million citizens should deeply care about, understand, and support aviation. (Talent Translation)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Addresses Congress Opening Day Reviews the War Situation of the Past Year</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 8th (Allied News Agency) - According to Washington sources, President Roosevelt delivered a speech at noon yesterday at the opening of the 78th US Congress, reviewing the war situation of the past year. He solemnly reiterated that the East Asia and South Pacific wars are the most important, and admitted that the Coral Sea, Solomon Islands, and New Guinea campaigns were setbacks for the anti-Axis powers. However, all these wars were defensive battles for the Allies, and part of them were delaying strategies. The President completely ignored Japan's offensive in the first year of the war. He declared, "Our purpose in the Pacific is to force Japan to fight. The military supplies transported by the US by air to Chongqing are actually equal to those transported when the Burma Road was open." The congress attended by the President for his speech opened at noon yesterday. After the senators and representatives were seated, the entire cabinet, led by Secretary of State Hull, entered the hall. The entire panel of judges of the Supreme Court and the ambassadors from various countries then followed. Then the Speaker of the House announced the opening of the meeting and introduced President Roosevelt to address the joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives. When the President mentioned the domestic situation, he said that the distribution of materials was not perfect. He hoped to increase the necessary machinery based on experience, and manage the wartime economy and simplify administrative procedures, so as not to allow monopolists to take the opportunity to manipulate prices. The President said, "With only a few years of preparation and one year of war, we have been able to deal with the entire war. However, we cannot forget that what we have achieved is not more than what the Soviet Union and Britain have achieved, because those two countries have developed their wartime industries while being constantly bombed and in a very difficult situation."</p>
<h3>German and Italian Comments</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Haitong News Agency) - Political figures here commented that Roosevelt's State of the Union address was aimed at his domestic audience, as many Americans were greatly puzzled by Roosevelt's decision to drag the United States into the war without any preparation. Therefore, Roosevelt tried to dispel doubts in his State of the Union address. The military situations he described in the Pacific, North Africa, and the Soviet Union were all inconsistent with the facts. Roosevelt also said that the ratio of losses between the German and American air forces in North Africa was two to one, with the United States having the upper hand. If what he said is true, then why has the United States still failed in North Africa? Is this not self-deception? Berlin is not afraid of Roosevelt's threat to attack Europe this year. The Führer recently said that Germany has sufficient military equipment, and if Britain and the United States launch an air raid from the British Isles, Germany will give a strong counterattack. Roosevelt's claim to concentrate forces on air raids is probably because he has learned a lesson in North Africa. The military equipment production figures Roosevelt mentioned are also aimed at deceiving his people. The war situation cannot be changed by Roosevelt's empty words. One of the most important sections of Roosevelt's State of the Union address is his acknowledgment of the current difficulties, which is unprecedented and therefore worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Haitong News Agency) - After learning about the content of President Roosevelt's speech, German Air Force General Quade told a Haitong News Agency reporter that the speech in Congress and the advantage of numbers do not result in obtaining air superiority. Three years of war have proved the bravery of the soldiers and the superiority of the weapons. Many of the American four-engine bombers were shot down. Currently, the US munitions industry is dispersed in various places and does not feel the threat of the air force. The German Air Force is also not afraid of the enemy's new aircraft and new weapons. The German army has dealt with various new weapons of the enemy, and the German army also has several new weapons that have not yet been used.</p>
<p>Rome, 8th (Central News Agency) - The Italian government expressed its opinion on the content of Roosevelt's address to Congress on the 7th, saying that Roosevelt showed in the address that the anti-Axis forces will have an offensive tone in Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo. This can be said to have completely forgotten the current situation of the war and exhausted the ability of absurdity. Roosevelt's statement that the American people will never isolate the Americas at any time only exposes his imperialist true colors and admits his ambition to dominate the world.</p>
<h3>US Has 1,900 National Ordnance Factories with 3.7 Million Workers Managed by the War Production Board</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Haitong News Agency) - Washington dispatch: The United States' 1,900 ordnance factories, with a total of 3.75 million workers, are now placed under the management of the so-called War Production Board. According to reports, the main work of the committee is to design simplified work methods and consider suggestions to accelerate production.</p>
<h3>Germany's Dedication to Submarine Warfare: Rapid Technological Advancements, Underground Factories Rushing to Manufacture, New Invention of Submersible Oil Tankers</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Haitong News Agency) – The attack rate of German submarines has increased due to technological improvements. The lead-acid batteries used in submarines have been replaced with nickel, reducing their weight by nine to ten tons. The nickel used in German submarines comes from Scandinavian countries.</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Haitong News Agency) – A source claims that Germany has been building a submarine factory inside a cliff near Brest for several weeks. The factory, built by the Speer Group, assembles submarines from parts and can continue operating during air raids.</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Haitong News Agency) – The Morning Post revealed for the first time today that Germany is using oil tanker submarines. The Allied forces previously believed that German submarines appearing in the Indian Ocean must have secret bases on the South African coast or the Azores. However, it has been proven that these bases do not exist. Therefore, submarines must have other ways to obtain supplies. According to German military reporter Silon, these are oil tanker submarines. German shipyards are working day and night to build these submarines, allowing submarine warfare to exert its power.</p>
<p>England Admits Feeling Threatened</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 8th (Haitong News Agency) – A reporter from the "Swedish Social Democratic Newspaper" stationed in London reports that the "Manchester Guardian" published a comment by Labour Party naval expert Winston, who believes that naval warfare is Britain's greatest danger. The threat of German submarines and countermeasures are currently hot topics of discussion in London. The British government has so far made no indication of measures to counter submarine activities. Winston pointed out that the British Navy and Air Force should strive to find excellent submarines to participate in naval warfare. Germany has been able to deploy a large number of submarines for combat, doubling the number of German submarines in August last year compared to the beginning of the war. The British should quickly reflect on this. Winston concluded that Germany has concentrated its efforts on manufacturing submarines and training technicians, while the British authorities seem to have neglected the threat of submarines.</p>
<p>Iceland is Now Different from the Past, Becoming a Transit Center</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 7th (Havas News Agency) – According to news from British and American sources, since German submarines expanded their activities in the Atlantic, British and American ships have been detouring through the North Atlantic for voyages. As a result, Iceland has been transformed into a transit center. At the same time, American troops have also been stationed on the island, and all supplies are requisitioned from the local area as much as possible. Therefore, Iceland's economic situation is becoming increasingly difficult. In addition, the island has a population of only over 120,000 people, and the arable land area is only about one-fourth of one percent of the total island area. Furthermore, imported goods have been reduced to the lowest limit, so the needs of the residents are becoming increasingly strained. It is expected that the parliament will soon pass a price control law to stabilize prices.</p>
<h3>British and American Trade Union Congress to Open on the 18th of This Month</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news from New York, the British and American Trade Union Congress is scheduled to open on the 18th of this month in Miami, Florida. This meeting is convened by the British Trades Union Congress and the American Federation of Labor. The Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) is not formally participating because it has not yet joined the international trade union movement. Recently, the relationship between the British Trades Union Congress and the American Congress of Industrial Organizations has improved, which is an achievement of British trade union leader Turner and others. The British delegation is led by Sir Citrine, Secretary-General of the British Trades Union Congress.</p>
<h3>German and Italian War Reports</h3>
<p>German Supreme Headquarters, 8th (Haitong News Agency) – The German military report this afternoon stated that yesterday, the German forces engaged in fierce battles with Soviet troops in the central Caucasus, the Don River basin, and northwest of Stalingrad, achieving considerable success. Soviet troops southeast of Lake Ilmen repeatedly attacked without success, with fifteen tanks destroyed. German fighter groups shot down thirty-two Soviet aircraft on the central and northern fronts, with no losses on our side. Soviet supply vehicles near Lake Ladoga were bombed by our aircraft. Last night, the city and port of Murmansk were also attacked. In Libya, enemy tanks and military supplies were heavily bombed by German aircraft, suffering heavy losses. Three enemy aircraft were shot down. Two patrol boats in the port of Benghazi were hit and damaged. The airfield in southern Tunisia was severely damaged by bombing. German aircraft sank two merchant ships totaling 16,000 tons and heavily damaged five others. Our submarines sank one warship and one destroyer east of Algiers.</p>
<p>Rome, 8th (Haitong News Agency) – The Italian military headquarters announced this afternoon that German aircraft attacked an enemy convoy off the coast of Algiers, sinking two Allied ships of 8,000 tons and heavily damaging five enemy ships. There was no intense fighting on the western front of Tunisia. Our troops repelled an attack by enemy scouts. Italian aircraft bombed the port of Bona again and jointly attacked enemy motorcades with German aircraft, destroying five vehicles. Five enemy aircraft were shot down in yesterday's air battle.</p>
<h3>Ships Gather in Gibraltar Port</h3>
<p>La Linea, 8th (Haitong News Agency) – There are now over fifty cargo ships gathered in the port of Gibraltar, including ten oil tankers, which will be protected by the battleships "Nelson" and "Rodney", the aircraft carriers "Furious" and "Victorious", as well as two cruisers, twenty-two destroyers, and sixteen gunboats, forming a convoy to sail elsewhere. There are many sailors of different nationalities in the port of Gibraltar.</p>
<h3>Khutuktu Visits Beijing for the First Time</h3>
<p>Beijing, 8th (Haitong News Agency) – Khutuktu, along with ten attendants, visited Beijing and paid a visit to the Japanese military headquarters. Khutuktu is thirteen years old this year. This is his first time traveling south and seeing a train.</p>

<h3>Central China Cigarette Rationing Association: Distribution Method Determined, Registration Limited to 300 Large Businesses, Single-Room Shops and Those Selling Other Goods Disqualified</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Central China Cigarette Rationing Association, the future of cigarette sales in this city, the manner in which they will be conducted, and how the association will distribute goods to cigarette shops of all sizes in this city have been of great concern to all parties. According to inquiries by a reporter from the Commercial News Agency, the internal organization of the Central China Cigarette Rationing Association has been fully organized, and the registration and distribution methods for cigarette and paper shops throughout the city have also been determined. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Distribution Units</p>
<p>The highest authority of the Central China Cigarette Rationing Association, in terms of cigarette business, is carried out jointly by four units. These four units are: (1) Huayuan Company (Japanese), (2) Jiuda Company (Japanese), (3) Yongtaihe (British and American cigarette factory under military management), and (4) China Tobacco Association (Chinese cigarette factories). Huayuan Company specializes in distributing Japanese cigarettes, Yongtaihe distributes British and American cigarettes, and the China Tobacco Association distributes domestic cigarettes. Jiuda Company is solely responsible for handling distribution to other locations. Furthermore, the China Cigarette Association is divided into two subgroups, one consisting of the four major cigarette companies, Huacheng, Nanyang, Dadong, and Fuxin, and the other consisting of twenty-four smaller companies, such as Xinyuan and Dadongnan.</p>
<p>Registration Restrictions</p>
<p>The rationing association is currently conducting surveys of all cigarette shops in this city. Once the survey is completed, registration will begin. Registration stipulates that there will be 300 large businesses throughout the city, with 150 classified as Grade A and 150 as Grade B. Registration will cease after these 300 businesses. Grade A and Grade B cigarette shops must meet the following qualifications: (1) not selling candles, (2) not selling paper products, (3) having a double-front storefront. In short, only large cigarette shops that specialize in selling cigarettes and have a double-front storefront are qualified.</p>
<p>Heavy Penalties for Not Collecting Goods</p>
<p>After the registration procedures for the 300 large businesses are completed, the rationing association can begin distributing goods. However, each large business must pay a deposit of 100,000 yuan before distribution, and all goods must be accepted each time. Failure to collect goods more than once will result in disqualification. As for small businesses, there are over 3,000 of them throughout the city. The distribution of goods to these 3,000 small cigarette shops is the responsibility of the 300 large businesses. Each Grade A cigarette shop is responsible for twelve small businesses, and each Grade B cigarette shop is responsible for eight small businesses.</p>
<p>Free Transportation of Cigarettes</p>
<p>After the cigarette distribution method in this city is determined, foreign cigarette merchants will be under the unified management of Jiuda Company. From then on, the black market for cigarettes can be eliminated, and cigarette prices can be stabilized. Moreover, after the implementation of the rationing system, the transportation of cigarettes within this city and to other locations will be free, without the need to obtain a permit.</p>
<h3>New Director of the Bank of Japan, Mr. Araki, Visits China to Study the Economy</h3>
<p>Mr. Araki, the new director of the Bank of Japan, is well-known in financial circles. He arrived in Shanghai from Tokyo a few days ago. He will visit various places in our country to study the economic situation. Mr. Qian, the Deputy Governor of the Central Reserve Bank, hosted a banquet at the Shanghai branch at noon yesterday (the 8th) and invited more than forty people from the financial community in this city to accompany him. The atmosphere was lively and the guests were happy, and the gathering did not end until around 2:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Submarine Telephone Line Installed Between Gongyi Wharf and Zhangjiabang</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs Port Affairs Department announced yesterday: "A submarine telephone line has been installed between Gongyi Wharf and Zhangjiabang in the upper reaches of this port, crossing the Huangpu River approximately 150 feet above the No. 3 civilian ship buoy. Warning signs are placed at both ends of the line onshore, and lights are hung at night for identification. All shippers and merchants are hereby notified."</p>
<h3>Eight Oil Mills Including Rihua and Rika Obtained Oil Extraction Materials; Extracted Oil Exclusively for Shanghai's Needs</h3>
<p>In order to maintain the supply of edible oil in the Shanghai market in the long term, the Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office will allocate the edible oil supplied by the military administration to Grade A and Grade B retailers for sale at their stores, as well as special allocations for legitimate business needs of various industries. It is reported that Grade B retailers have been asked to sell off the ten days' worth of oil they received within four days, starting from the 7th. After Grade B retailers have sold out, the allocation will be distributed to both Grade A and Grade B retailers for sale. At the same time, in order to smooth the source of edible oil, in addition to ordering edible oil from Qingdao and Dalian, the authorities also plan to supply oil extraction materials to increase local production. A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency learned from the oil pressing industry yesterday that oil extraction materials such as soybeans, rapeseed, and cottonseed have been transported to Shanghai in large quantities and allocated to various oil mills. It is reported that Rihua Oil Manufacturing Co., Ltd.'s Shanghai Factory, Japan Oil and Fat Co., Ltd.'s Shanghai Factory, Chunam Industry Co., Ltd., Kichi Yu Go Oil Factory, Great Japan Oil Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Taishan Oil Mill, Wanguo Oil Manufacturing Factory, and Minhang Oil Mill have all obtained raw materials and started increasing production. The extracted oil will be used to supply the needs of Shanghai citizens. The existing stock of approximately 30,000 dan of oil is expected to be sold out during the Lunar New Year. Future needs will be supplied primarily by oil extracted in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Sugar Allocation Advanced; Application Period for Special Allocations for Various Industries to End Soon</h3>
<p>In view of the increased demand for sugar during the Lunar New Year period, the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office has requested the authorities to increase the January sugar allocation to 50,000 bags, an increase of 20,000 bags compared to the previous month, in order to fully maintain the supply of sugar in the Shanghai market. The authorities have approved this request and the cooperative has obtained a movement permit to transport the allocated sugar from Pudong to its warehouses for storage. At the same time, it is preparing to allocate it to Grade A retailers and registered Grade B users. However, due to the current tight credit situation, Grade A retailers are finding it difficult to raise the funds needed to receive the sugar, so they have agreed with the cooperative to allocate 40,000 bags for the time being. The allocation method is as follows: (1) a total of 35,000 bags will be allocated to Grade A retailers and Grade B users; (2) 5,000 bags will be specially allocated to restaurants, food stores, and other businesses. The types of sugar allocated include Ersi coarse sand, HX car white, HM car white, snow white, Dutch red, Ben Factory ice flower green, winter service green, Ben Factory rock sugar, and TK car sugar. It is reported that the sugar will be allocated in advance on January 15th.</p>
<p>Retail Methods Already Stipulated</p>
<p>Regarding the sales methods, according to reliable information obtained by our reporter from the cooperative, before the implementation of the new system of sugar distribution based on population, sugar will still be purchased based on property tax receipts and citizen certificates for the time being. The date and method of the next sugar sale will be announced on Monday. (1) Those with property tax receipts can still purchase 40 yuan worth of sugar at a time. However, those using property tax receipts to purchase sugar must bring their citizen certificate with an address that matches the receipt in order to be allowed to purchase. (2) Those with public concession citizen certificates and French concession identity cards can purchase up to one yuan worth of sugar per person each time. Retailers selling sugar will be supervised by personnel dispatched by the cooperative to prevent abuses.</p>
<p>Special Allocations Needed for Various Industries</p>
<p>The cooperative announced yesterday that the application period for special allocations will end on Sunday. "Since the implementation of sugar purchases based on property tax receipts and citizen certificates, in order to meet the actual needs of sugar for restaurants, food stores, and other businesses, there have been special allocation regulations. Two months have passed, and it is now widespread. The application period will end on the 11th of this month. Applications received after the deadline will not be accepted. This is hereby announced."</p>
<p>Grade B Sugar Allocation Requires Retail Tax</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office has already completed the distribution of sugar allocated to Grade B industries for business needs and set a deadline for collecting the goods. However, according to a reporter from the Central News Agency, a retail tax of 2% must also be paid for this Grade B allocation of sugar. Shops must also provide their own sugar bags, as the sugar stores do not provide bags. Stores in various industries should take note to avoid problems occurring at the last minute.</p>
<h3>Mayor Chen Gives Broadcast Speech</h3>
<p>The Mayor of Shanghai Special Municipality, Mr. Chen Gongbo, gave a nationwide radio address at the Shanghai Radio Station at 10:10 PM the other day, titled "The New National Movement and Refreshing Politics." The main points of his speech were: (1) He hoped that every citizen would understand the close relationship between themselves and the country, especially during the current wartime period, where the responsibilities of the front and rear lines are equally important, and should not abandon themselves. (2) He urged people to renew themselves, restore their inherent spirit, remain incorruptible, unyielding, and persevere in the work of reconstruction. (3) He called for strengthening creative power, purging accumulated bad habits, and striving for substantive progress in everything, avoiding any reliance on luck or dependence, which would lead to procrastination and mistakes. (4) He emphasized that the 32nd year of the Republic of China is the most important year in Chinese history, the safety and danger of the country rests on this year, and the hope for the future also rests on this year. He hoped that people would make great efforts to promote the glory and strength of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>French Municipal Council Old Bonds: Mandatory Stamping</h3>
<p>Stating Repayment and Interest Payment with Central Reserve Bank Notes</p>
<p>Mr. Dou Ruifu, the Director of the Finance Department of the French Municipal Council, issued an important announcement yesterday regarding the stamping of bonds issued before 1942, stating: "All holders of bonds issued by this council before January 1, 1942, must bring their bonds to the council's bank at 375 Avenue Joffre before February 28, 1943, to complete the bond stamping procedure. This procedure is mandatory and its purpose is to record the calculation and payment of interest and principal for each type of bond in Central Reserve Bank notes, taking into account current currency regulations. The council will not be responsible for any consequences arising from any measures taken in the future regarding bondholders who fail to comply with this procedure within the specified period."</p>
<h3>Public Industry Exchange to Resume Trading Next Month; Speculative Behavior Absolutely Prohibited After Resumption</h3>
<p>Since the Public Industry Exchange has been approved to resume operations under military administration, it is currently considering the preparations. The registration of brokers and listed stocks was closed on December 20th of last year. (1) Listed stocks will primarily be Chinese stocks, with special care taken in the review and selection. Chinese stocks are limited to companies approved and registered by the relevant authorities, and stocks of newly established shell companies will be prohibited from listing and trading. (2) The qualifications of brokers will be strictly reviewed. They must have a well-established reputation and substantial assets, and must also pay a security deposit as a guarantee. In addition, measures are being planned to prevent speculation, block speculative stocks, thoroughly restrict short selling, and select sound stocks for trading. It is reported that the Public Industry Exchange will announce the resumption of trading in February.</p>
<h3>Records of the East Asia Economic Roundtable Conference (9)</h3>
<p>Translated from the "Domei Juho" in late November of the 31st year.</p>
<p>Day 3 (November 28th)</p>
<p>Summary of Statements by Heads of Relevant Bureaus</p>
<p>Mori Shige - Imperial Councilor of the Greater East Asia Ministry</p>
<p>In the 11th year of Kowa, the twenty-year million-household immigration plan was established as a national policy, but it encountered the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War while implementing the second five-year plan. Therefore, in conjunction with the strengthening of domestic production, which has become an urgent task, the dispersal of the Yamato people within the region, and other issues on the construction line of Greater East Asia, it is necessary to carefully review the implementation of established policies. However, considering the strengthening of the northern base for Greater East Asia defense, the uniqueness of Manchuria as the axis of the development policy, ethnic harmony, etc., while promoting the work of the Manchurian Development Volunteer Corps, the execution of established policies is also what we expect.</p>
<p>Usami - Bureau Chief</p>
<p>In North China, in order to ensure the increased production of cotton and food, it is first necessary to secure and supply agricultural production materials and thoroughly popularize agricultural finance. Regarding agricultural materials, such as fertilizer, we are currently completely dependent on Central China and Manchuria. In North China, a nitrogen fertilizer factory is under construction. Other items such as medicines, sprayers, and agricultural implements are currently supplied by Japan. However, for items such as medicines, in the future it may be possible to import raw materials from the South and then process and manufacture them in North China. Agricultural finance is currently being implemented through the United Reserve Bank of China, but further research is needed to achieve lower interest rates.</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the demand for the unification of cotton purchase and allocation agencies, although the government has not yet decided to establish such an agency, it is necessary to correct the allocation agencies. This is well known, so this point is currently being studied. In short, the most efficient agency must be formed according to the actual conditions on the ground.</p>
<p>(2) North China has always expected to import miscellaneous grains from Mengjiang, but the reason why this has not been smoothly executed is said to be due to the exchange rate problem, but fundamentally, it is due to the delayed results of the Mengjiang food production plan. Therefore, the first countermeasure is that it is necessary to rapidly expand the agricultural productivity of Mengjiang.</p>
<p>Kanda - Director of the Business Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry</p>
<p>The industry of the entire Co-Prosperity Sphere must be concentrated as much as possible for the victory in the future war, which goes without saying. Therefore, the focus must be on the rapid increase and revitalization of the four major industries of iron, coal, shipbuilding, and light metals. Even if other industries are likely to be constrained by this, we have no choice but to let it happen naturally. Ships and labor must also be allocated from this perspective. However, in order to promote the key industries with the minimum amount of materials, labor, and transportation, it is necessary to re-examine local conditions. For example, regarding the increased production of iron ore:</p>
<p>(1) All scrap iron in the Greater East Asia region must be systematically provided.</p>
<p>(2) In view of the difficulty of increasing the production of local iron ore and coal, and the difficulties in transportation, it is necessary to build small smelting furnaces in Korea, Taiwan, North China, Hainan Island, and Malaya.</p>
<p>(3) In the mainland, the efficiency of smelting furnaces is very low and operation is difficult due to materials, labor, etc. These can be transplanted to suitable locations, but it is probably impossible to realize this immediately.</p>
<p>In short, we must now break away from the common habit of considering local conditions from the perspective of usage fees. Although usage fees are also very high for small smelting furnaces, if the country needs them, we must aim to materialize them in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Haraguchi - Director of the Foreign Capital Bureau of the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>The purpose of price countermeasures in Greater East Asia, as decided in the Greater East Asia Construction Deliberation Council, is to mutually enhance production, streamline the exchange of goods, and adjust labor in each region of Greater East Asia. At the same time, in order to complete the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, in accordance with the actual conditions and the level of public knowledge in each region, we must strive to enhance production, stabilize people's livelihoods, and streamline the exchange of goods, which goes without saying. In addition, in order to achieve price soundness, the equalization of prices in each region is also a matter of urgency. However, it is necessary to consider the specific circumstances of each region and divide them into several time stages according to the differences in one region. Since the China Incident, Japan has maintained the so-called low-price policy, on the one hand fulfilling the price formation policy that makes it possible to increase production necessary for wartime. At the same time, we must strive for perfection in finance, industry, transportation, and labor. In particular, in each region within the sphere, it is imperative to respond to Japan's low-price policy, complete the exchange of goods necessary for the war effort, stabilize people's livelihoods, and eliminate regional price differences, which is a very difficult task. I hope that in the near future, we will create an adjustment mechanism from both the exchange rate and transaction sides to quickly adjust price differences.</p>
<p>Yamaguchi - Director of the Transaction Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry</p>
<p>The exchange of goods under the Greater East Asia War is one aspect of the establishment policy of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, the face and character of the transaction are completely different. In other words, from a regional perspective, it is limited to within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and in terms of its character, in order to support the Greater East Asia War to the end, it is necessary to concentrate all forces and transform into a highly planned transaction based on the national will, standing on the highest purpose.</p>
<p>(1) The exchange of goods with the Southern resource zone is quite difficult to implement completely immediately due to various reasons. Therefore, the smooth exchange of goods between China, Japan, and Manchuria, with East Asian trade as the core, has increased its importance. In order to streamline this transaction according to plan, the government took the opportunity to form the Trade Control Association in January of this year, and has been paying attention to the reorganization of transaction-related agencies, simplification of procedures, allocation of packaging materials, and so on. In Manchuria and China, in response to this, they are also seeking to reorganize transaction agencies and take many other measures.</p>
<p>(2) However, as a current transaction promotion policy, there is still a need to improve the collection, allocation, and transaction mechanisms of goods within each region. In particular, the issue of price adjustment for transaction goods based on the different price levels in each region must be resolved quickly using a unified method. Also, in terms of transaction volume, judging from the actual results, it is not much better than the goods problem.</p>
<p>(3) China, Japan, and Manchuria each have their own unique characteristics in terms of productivity, and it is necessary to develop these characteristics. The future of East Asian trade is very bright, but its route is not very smooth. In order to streamline East Asian planned transactions, I especially hope for the active cooperation of cities in various regions.</p>

<h3>Seventh Batch of Coal Supply Allocated; Four Thousand Tons Distributed to 376 Businesses; Price Set at 457.63 Yuan Per Ton</h3>
<p>Since the large-scale Yantai white coal supply has been strictly controlled by the authorities and designated to be handled by the Dachung United Coal Company on a periodic basis, the entire coal market in Shanghai has returned to normal. Unfavorable practices such as speculation, hoarding, and monopolies have dissipated. According to the Coal Industry Association, the Dachung United Coal Company has completed the allocation of the seventh batch of coal. This batch of coal supplies consists of a single type of Jiaozuo briquettes, totaling 4,000 tons. The official price per ton is set at 457.63 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates. Prior to the allocation, 376 businesses were designated as eligible to receive coal. It is reported that the Jiaozuo briquettes are of high quality white coal, making them ideal for use in stoves. As for the eighth batch of coal supplies, negotiations are still underway and are expected to be finalized soon. Once all the details are agreed upon, the Dachung United Coal Company will notify the Coal Industry Association, which will then inform the relevant businesses to purchase the allocated quantities.</p>
<p>Black Market Transactions Not Yet Eliminated</p>
<p>The coal market at 405 Tianjin Road, which was ordered to cease operations by the authorities, has recently been reorganized by the Coal Industry Association into a "Transportation Liaison Office for Coal Businesses." However, the sale of coal remains strictly prohibited. Nevertheless, clandestine transactions continue to occur, leading to illegal price increases for various types of coal. It is hoped that the authorities will investigate and crack down on these practices.</p>
<p>Strictly Suppressing Price Gouging for Profit</p>
<p>Investigations reveal that the authorities in both concessions adjusted and limited the prices of various types of Yantai white coal briquettes and chips at the end of last year. These price limits were announced to take effect from January of this year and all coal merchants were required to comply without exception. While many have adhered to the price limits, some have continued to engage in secret transactions. The authorities are now determined to suppress coal prices and increase coal reserves. In addition to continuing to procure and distribute large quantities of coal to Shanghai, those who engage in private transactions for exorbitant profits will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Major Reforms in the Fire Brigade to Cope with Air Raids; Public Cooperation Needed</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Shimizu, the Fire Chief of the Public Works Department, major reforms will be implemented in the Fire Brigade to enable it to handle any firefighting tasks, including those resulting from air raids. He also hopes that all residents of Shanghai, regardless of nationality, will do their best to assist the authorities during air raid alerts.</p>
<p>Serving the Air Defense Effort</p>
<p>Mr. Shimizu stated that it is crucial for Shanghai residents to serve the community at this time. By assisting the authorities, residents are also ensuring their own safety. The Fire Brigade will demonstrate its effectiveness during air raid alerts. Its future plans will rely on the Fire Brigade to serve the air defense effort. He added that he has devised several other ways to assist the Fire Brigade personnel.</p>
<p>Participation Not Limited by Nationality</p>
<p>Regarding the question of whether participation in the Fire Brigade will be restricted by nationality, he stated that firefighting is a public service, not for the benefit of individuals, and therefore, no restrictions will be imposed. To enhance the effectiveness of the Fire Brigade, a large number of people are welcome to join, and there will be no limit on the number of participants.</p>
<h3>Centralized Control of Cotton Production in Three Provinces; Regional Divisions</h3>
<p>The Central China Cotton Control Association will uniformly purchase cotton from the production areas and implement allocation. To increase production, the Ministry of Industry, based on the actual conditions of cotton-producing counties in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, has divided the area into eight zones and established cotton industry management agencies. These agencies will be responsible for managing breeding, promotion, inspection, grading, and improving transportation, as well as enhancing cotton quality. The implementation scope is temporarily limited to the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. Based on actual cotton production conditions, the area is divided into eight zones, including Nanjing, Shanghai, East Zhejiang, Yancheng Reclamation Area, Southern Jiangsu, and Northern Jiangsu. The Yancheng Reclamation Area includes Qidong, Haimen, Nantong, Rugao, Dongtai, Yancheng, Ganyu, and Lianshui counties. Implementation has already begun in Shanghai, Nanjing, and the Yancheng Reclamation Area.</p>
<h3>Manufacturing Narcotics in Cleansing Area; Capital Punishment Imposed</h3>
<p>A notice issued by Chen, concurrently the director of the Shanghai Cleansing Branch, states: "Since the implementation of Cleansing in this Branch, repeated notices have been issued regarding narcotics incidents in the Cleansing area, with strict prohibitions. However, some unscrupulous individuals continue to secretly manufacture or sell narcotics in the Cleansing area, disregarding the law and harming the people. This must be strictly suppressed to achieve the goal of making the Cleansing area a model district. From the date of this notice, anyone found manufacturing morphine, cocaine, heroin, or other compounds, or various colored pills made by combining them, will be subject to capital punishment. Those who sell or carry these substances will be severely punished. No leniency will be shown. This notice is issued."</p>
<h3>Japanese Consular Meeting to Discuss Economic Issues</h3>
<p>A Japanese consular meeting, chaired by the Japanese Minister Mr. Tajiri, will be held on the 11th of this month. The main purpose of this meeting is to discuss issues related to economic cooperation in Shanghai and other parts of Central China. The agenda will include: (1) Stabilizing the value of the Central Reserve Certificates; (2) Rationalizing the purchase and distribution of goods; and (3) Expanding productivity and adjusting trade organizations. The first item is entirely related to China, while the second item will be discussed based on the principle of Sino-Japanese cooperation. The third item will be handled by Japanese national policy companies.</p>
<h3>Money Shops to Offer Loans to Members, Allocated According to Headcount</h3>
<p>The United Reserve Bank of Money Shops has recently notified its members that if a member shop has legitimate business needs, it may apply to the bank for a loan by providing reliable collateral in accordance with the provisional measures for loan matters. After the bank approves the application and assesses the value and discount, the funds will be allocated according to headcount.</p>
<h3>Winter Hygiene Campaign Begins; Authorities Define Hygiene Guidelines; Factories Must Implement Thoroughly</h3>
<p>The Winter Hygiene Campaign is about to begin. The relevant authorities have defined the guidelines for the Winter Hygiene Campaign in factories and distributed them to the relevant trade associations for dissemination to their members for implementation. The main points are as follows: (1) Conduct a winter cleanup. Each factory should organize a comprehensive cleanup during working hours, led by senior staff, to eliminate accumulated dirt and ensure cleanliness throughout the factory. (2) Install air conditioning equipment. During the winter, workplaces often close windows and doors due to the cold, which hinders air circulation and affects the health of workers. Efforts should be made to improve and install air conditioning equipment. (3) Re-vaccinate against smallpox. The danger of smallpox is similar to that of cholera. Crowded factories are particularly susceptible to transmission. Factory owners should encourage workers to be vaccinated against smallpox for prevention. (4) Prepare for hygiene and health facilities. During this extraordinary period, factories find it difficult to maintain operations, and workers face financial difficulties and inadequate nutrition. Cleanliness and hygiene are difficult to maintain, but this has significant long-term impacts. Labor and management should work together and cooperate. They may also jointly establish clinics, public bathhouses, simple canteens, and laundry facilities with nearby factories to benefit workers. (5) Encourage workers to pay attention to food hygiene. Factory managers should encourage workers to pay attention to food hygiene and strictly supervise cooks to ensure cleanliness.</p>
<h3>Flour Product Shops to Implement Food for Flour Exchange Program; Final Allotment Has Begun; Limited to Manufacturing Flatbread, Steamed Buns, Etc.</h3>
<p>Flour product shops in both concessions have not yet formally implemented the exchange and retail measures announced by the Public Works Department at the end of last year. It is now known that the allocation section of the Commodities Control Department of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession issued notices and flour sales orders to shops selling sliced noodles, flatbread, steamed buns, fried dough sticks, etc., yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>New Measures for the Next Allocation</p>
<p>In order to universally increase the flour allotment for residents in both concessions, the Commodities Control Department of the Public Works Department will implement new measures from the next period, allocating the flour originally distributed to flour product shops fairly to households. The shops will then be ordered to sell flour products in exchange for customers' flour certificates instead of cash.</p>
<p>Issuing Final Flour Sales Orders</p>
<p>Due to the reasons mentioned above, the Public Works Department notified all licensed shops selling sliced noodles, flatbread, steamed buns, fried dough sticks, etc., yesterday, ordering them to implement the new measures immediately and issuing the final flour sales orders. This allows these establishments to keep said flour as stock for business needs. It is restricted to the sole purpose of manufacturing sliced noodles, flatbread, steamed buns and youtiao. It cannot be used for other purposes. It is reported that after receiving the notice, the mechanized noodle industry requested the authorities to slightly modify the measures to facilitate their business operations.</p>
<h3>23rd Ration Increased by Half a Sheng of Rice</h3>
<p>Public Works Department has issued notice number 6229 which briefly states that the 22nd coupons for rice and flour certificates are valid until the 9th of this month, after which they will be voided. From the 11th to the 19th of this month, rice shops and the department's rice sales offices will only sell rice and flour based on the 23rd coupons. At that time, rice shops with the registered number noted on the coupons will sell one sheng of brown rice, half a sheng of white rice, and half a sheng of broken rice per coupon, with a total price of five yuan. For each flour certificate coupon, one catty and twelve taels of flour will be sold at a price of three yuan and eighty-five cents. Also, all rice shops and the department's rice sales offices will temporarily suspend sales for one day on the 20th of this month.</p>
<h3>"Skinning Chicken" Active</h3>
<p>As the winter is bitterly cold and woolen goods are skyrocketing in price, a group of criminals are using trickery to lure children to secluded places, stripping them of their woolen shirts and trousers, and pawning them for cash. In light of these illegal actions, parents should pay attention to their children at all times. Ye Yongsheng, the grandson of Ye Yongsheng, the owner of the Yongshun Meat Shop at 146 Ningxing Street in the French Concession, named Shouzhao, only eight years old, was playing outside the door yesterday when he was lured by a bandit to the intersection of Penglai Road and Zhonghua Road in Nanshi. The bandit forcibly stripped the child of his woolen shirt. The child immediately wailed. Fortunately, Zheng Jingxia, a detective from the Municipal Police Department, was patrolling the area. Hearing the cries, he chased after the bandit and apprehended him along with the stolen goods. The bandit, named Cao Junsheng, 18 years old, from Suzhou, residing on the third floor of 387 Avenue Edward VII, (egg business), was reported to Guo Shaoyi, the captain of the general team. The bandit has been escorted to the headquarters and transferred to the local court for punishment.</p>

<h3>Relocation of Remains Kept in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since being ordered to relocate the remains kept in the city, the Guohua Coffin Transport Department has completed 26 shipments, and seven batches of remains belonging to impoverished families have been transported. It is now known that the 27th shipment to Ningbo and the eighth batch of remains belonging to impoverished families, totaling 100 coffins, will be loaded onto the Xinning Shao liner this afternoon (the 9th) at 4:00 PM and transported to Ningbo. It is reported that the Coffin Transport Department plans to transport a large number of remains belonging to people from Jiangsu and Zhejiang before the Lunar New Year. Therefore, families with remains in the city can register at No. 2, Lane 16, Jing'an Temple Road before the end of this month. There is no limit to the number of remains accepted for impoverished families at reduced rates.</p>
<h3>Relief Funds for Teachers and Staff in Private Schools: Distribution Method Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>Regarding the 350,000 yuan in temporary relief funds allocated by the central government for private primary and secondary schools and their staff in the Shanghai Special District, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Finance, and the Shanghai Municipal Government have each sent a representative to form a committee for temporary relief funds for private primary and secondary schools and their staff in the Shanghai Special District to handle the distribution. It is now known that the committee held its second meeting on January 7 (Thursday) from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM in the conference room of the Municipal Bureau of Education. In addition to assigning personnel to various positions in the committee, the principles and specific methods for distributing the relief funds were decided upon. They are now rushing to complete the necessary procedures in order to distribute the funds as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Financial Bureau Stipulates: Noodle, Rice, and Dim Sum Stalls Exempt from Tax</h3>
<p>Since the issuance of the order to levy tax on banquets in the city, the collection of this tax from restaurants and kitchens has been clearly stipulated by the Municipal Finance Bureau. The tax is not limited to full-table banquets; all separately sold stir-fried dishes are subject to tax. It has also been stipulated that noodle dishes are not subject to tax. The Financial Bureau, fearing that restaurants may misinterpret the order, has reiterated that stalls selling only noodles, rice, and dim sum are exempt from tax to alleviate the burden on the people. However, restaurants that handle full-table banquets must collect the tax on noodles and stir-fried dishes included in the banquet. All cold dishes, soups, noodles, rice, and dim sum that are sold at the same time, as well as shops that sell both dishes and rice, must also be taxed together and cannot be excluded separately.</p>

<h3>Chinese Stocks Remain Weak Under Pressure to Liquidate</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market saw little interest from new and old investors, who were constrained by tight credit and discouraged by the eleven-day downward trend. On the contrary, sellers seeking to liquidate continued to lower prices to sell off their holdings. There were some exceptions. The shares of Dachung and Hongxing textile companies, which had been declining for twenty-three days with little interest, were acquired by some buyers, with the final transaction price at 8.75 yuan. Daguangming Textile rose 0.25 yuan to 10.75 yuan. Wing On Spinning Mill rose slightly by 0.15 yuan to 340 yuan. Dasheng No. 1 and No. 3 mills were also oversupplied and declined, with the former at 380 yuan and the latter at 365 yuan. In the department store sector, Wing On traded around 124.6 yuan, while Sincere traded at 137.5 yuan, down 5 yuan. National Goods fell to 71.2 yuan, down 1 to 2.5 yuan. In the cultural sector, World Book Company fell again to 101 yuan, while China traded between 155 and 160 yuan, down 2 yuan. Commercial Press traded at 440 yuan. Transactions were thin and prices were stagnant. New pharmaceutical stocks continued to decline across the board. Minyi continued to be sold off, falling to the 60 yuan level.

Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity remained stable at around 59 yuan. China General Match was trading ex-rights. Investors remained hesitant and the price fell slightly to 130 yuan, down 15 yuan. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco traded below 120 yuan, down 2.5 yuan. Salt Bank traded at 335 yuan and 30 yuan. Most other stocks also declined and trading was thin. The details are listed below.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Have Asking Prices, But No Market</h3>
<p>The government bond market is shrinking, and transactions are decreasing and becoming more chaotic. As the Lunar New Year approaches and investors have not yet settled their accounts, the market is unlikely to recover. It is estimated that it will take two weeks before the market can stabilize. Most transactions yesterday were inquiries over the telephone. Most brokers at the exchange have closed, so transactions were thin. There were some transactions in Class C bonds at a price of 0.80 to 0.05 yuan, but the final price was only 0.06 yuan. The asking price for Class A bonds was around 50 yuan, the asking price for Class B bonds was 49.3 to 49.8 yuan, the asking price for Class D bonds was 48.7 to 49 yuan, and the asking price for Class E bonds was 49.4 yuan. There were asking prices, but no transactions.</p>
<h3>Declining Local Gold Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the listed price for gold jewelry at local silver shops was 3,050 yuan per tael (buying price was about 300 yuan less). The inter-dealer price continued to decline without rebounding, falling below 2,900 yuan. In the morning, the price was 2,910 yuan. The price fell by 80 yuan to 2,830 yuan at noon and was still difficult to sell. The spread was small, only 80 yuan, and trading was thin. The listed price for sterling silver jewelry remained at 16 yuan per tael. The inter-dealer price was 16.79 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the interbank lending rate announced by the Money Shops Association was 0.17 yuan, unchanged.</p>
<h3>Military Notes Firm; Allied Currency Remains Slightly Weak</h3>
<p>The military notes remained firm. The inter-dealer price was 5.5513 yuan. The buying and selling prices at small money shops and banks were 5.555 and 5.545 yuan. The Allied currency was slightly weaker by 0.03 yuan. Traders sold at 3.72 yuan and bought at 3.67 yuan.</p>
<h3>Banks Raise Safe Deposit Box Fees; Seven Money Shops Join the Money Bank</h3>
<p>Several commercial banks in the city have recently increased their fees for providing safe deposit box services to customers due to rising expenses. Some banks have raised the minimum annual rental fee for small safe deposit boxes from 6 yuan or 10 yuan to a minimum of 20 yuan or 25 yuan starting January 1 of this year.</p>
<p>The United Reserve Committee of the Banking Industry of the city notified banks and money shops yesterday that it has approved the application of seven money shops, including Tongda, Dacheng, Taichang, Dayou, Zhenfeng, Guangda, and Defu, to join the bank as members. Starting January 11, 1943, banks and money shops should accept payment instruments from these money shops and entrust the committee to collect them, in accordance with the procedures for other member money shops.</p>
<h3>Weak Demand for Coarse Grains</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for coarse grains saw limited activity due to tight credit. However, prices did not decline significantly. 50 bags of Chongming red sand were sold at 335 yuan. Two carts of Yuanlong soybean cake were sold at 91 yuan and 91.25 yuan. 3,000 pieces of Feizi cake were sold at 90.05 yuan.</p>
<h3>Very Little Cotton Cloth Trading</h3>
<p>The cotton cloth market remained firm yesterday, with very few transactions. Sijunzi flannel was 8.65 yuan, up 0.15 yuan from yesterday's final price. Taohua Ladies' Forest remained at 360 yuan. Qin Liangyu bleached cloth was 230 yuan. White Cat chemical cloth was 194 yuan.</p>
<h3>Maple Meat Plunges Continuously</h3>
<p>The price of maple meat has fallen due to a slight increase in supply and a lack of strong buying interest. The market is currently around 1,000 yuan, and there are few buyers. There are concerns that the price may fall further.</p>
<h3>Small Tangerine Cakes Arrive in Small Quantities</h3>
<p>Small tangerine cakes have not arrived for a long time, and market inventories are low. Recently, a new shipment of a dozen boxes has arrived. The quality of the goods is average and not very popular, resulting in a large gap between the asking price and the offer, and no transactions have been made yet.</p>
<h3>Stable Pepper Market</h3>
<p>The pepper market has been quiet recently, with little buying interest from out-of-town merchants. The market is stable, but sellers are unwilling to lower their prices. For example, sellers are unwilling to sell Number 1 pepper for less than 1,000 yuan, so the market is holding firm. However, due to tight credit conditions within the year, it is unlikely that the price will rise.</p>
<h3>Sesame Candy Uneven in Quality, Sluggish Sales</h3>
<p>Sales of sesame candy of various sizes (from 3 fen to 6 fen) remained sluggish yesterday. The quality of the goods is currently uneven, and inventories are low. Sellers with small quantities of spot goods are holding firm, and standard prices have not fallen due to poor sales. Instead, prices have been boosted by the uneven quality of the goods. Currently, 3 fen sesame candy is selling for 1,500 yuan per box, 4 fen sesame candy is selling for 1,450 yuan per box (these two sizes have been in short supply for a long time), 5 fen sesame candy is offered at 1,300 yuan per box, and 6 fen sesame candy is offered at 1,200 yuan per box. The market price for 3 fen Western sesame candy is around 1,700 yuan.</p>
<h3>Nanhui Peanuts Scarce and Expensive</h3>
<p>Nanhui peanuts are scarce and selling quickly, making the market very expensive. Currently, selected raw peanuts are selling for 720 yuan, ordinary raw peanuts are selling for 680 yuan, and broken-shell peanuts are selling for 630-640 yuan. If supplies remain low, prices are likely to rise further.</p>
<h3>Soap Market Performs Exceptionally Well</h3>
<p>Among daily necessities, soap prices have been rising steadily. Prices for other items remain firm. Phoenix brand matches are 3,000 yuan, Beauty brand are 3,150 yuan, Golden Cauldron brand are 2,800 yuan, miscellaneous brands are 2,100 yuan, Gu Ben soap is 550 yuan, Bai Xiangmao is 510 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap is 450 yuan, Scissors soap is 530 yuan, British Pride wax candles are 510 yuan, and Sengmao candles are 450 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes See No Major Price Fluctuations</h3>
<p>The cigarette market is balanced, so prices are relatively stable. John Player's is selling for 9,600 yuan, Old Knife is 8,550 yuan, Pin Hai is 7,800 yuan, Fairy is 7,600 yuan, Five Flowers is 6,000 yuan, Japanese cigarettes Golden Gun is 2,900 yuan, Golden Mansion is 3,600 yuan, Red Rose is 2,700 yuan, All Six is 1,000 yuan, Nian Zhi is 2,950 yuan, Compass is 2,600 yuan, Chinese cigarettes Pyramid is 6,250 yuan, Beauty is 5,500 yuan, Yu Shu is 3,750 yuan, White Dragon is 3,800 yuan, and Huang Yu Long is 2,600 yuan.</p>

At the same time, the tea company also sold over ten dan of broken black tea at 480 yuan per dan. In addition, Shengtang Tea Company sold three dan of green tea at 750 yuan. These were sold by Zhiji Tea Factory and Dingfeng Tea Firm.</p>

<h3>Prison</h3>
<p>— Bright Moon</p>
<p>Imprisonment, in the eyes of ordinary people, is an unfortunate and unlucky event. However, throughout history, both in China and abroad, many great figures have been imprisoned. "King Wen was imprisoned in Youli," which everyone knows, is one example. In modern times, revolutionary movements in various countries have surged, and thus, groups of patriots and righteous individuals have been imprisoned. Therefore, some say that a person who has not been imprisoned cannot become a successful politician. This statement seems somewhat extreme. To put it moderately and objectively, politicians indeed have a higher chance of being imprisoned. However, not every politician has been imprisoned, and not everyone who has been imprisoned can become a successful politician.</p>
<p>The relationship between politicians and prisons is set aside for now, as there are no statistics for comparative research. This article will only discuss prisons themselves.</p>
<p>Imprisonment was called penal servitude in ancient China, and it is still called penal servitude today. The pain of imprisonment lies in the loss of freedom.</p>
<p>Reading Fang Bao's "Miscellaneous Records from Prison" written during the Qing Dynasty fills one with terror of prisons. In the Qing Dynasty, with its strict literary inquisition, Fang Bao dared to write this piece and have it published and circulated, which was no easy feat. The "sitting" in imprisonment can seemingly be endured with patience. What is unbearable is the prison itself, a place that signifies confinement, filth, darkness, dampness, coldness, and cruelty. Villagers and commoners fear death and going to hell most of all. In reality, why even mention hell? The human prisons described by Fang Bao, with their miserable conditions, what difference is there between them and the underworld hell imagined by villagers and commoners?</p>
<p>Forgive me for not having an antiquarian's obsession, so I cannot judge what differences existed between the prisons before Fang Bao's time and those he described. Forgive me for not having investigative opportunities, so I cannot judge what differences exist between the current prisons and those he described.</p>
<p>The opportunistic and cunning British and Americans refuse to abolish extraterritoriality in China, yet they claim that China's judiciary needs to be improved and its prisons reformed. What is the true state of prisons in our country? I think only those who have been imprisoned can know in detail. Those who were imprisoned ten or twenty years ago, if imprisoned twice or three times, can accurately compare what differences exist between current prisons and those of the past.</p>
<h3>On "Bearing Hardship" and "Suffering Losses"</h3>
<p>— Qiulang</p>
<p>Time flies swiftly, and in the blink of an eye, I am beginning my thirty-second year. At the start of this year, based on the saying, "A year's plan starts in spring," it seems that one should redouble efforts at the time when spring returns to the earth, in order to lay a certain foundation for the year. I, the writer, am not talented and consider myself without grand plans to offer to the country and society. However, with the arrival of this new year, since I do not wish to make idle auspicious remarks, and since the people of Shanghai like to "eat," I will tentatively discuss the word "eat." However, living in this turbulent era, everything is being reformed, and the aspect of "eating" should also be specially improved in order to cope with the environment. Therefore, the "eating" that I speak of involves two carefully selected flavors, and the way of eating is not ordinary. I will elaborate as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Bearing Hardship: As the saying goes, "Only by bearing the bitterest of the bitter can one become the superior of men." Therefore, bearing hardship is something we should endure. Observing the great men of the past and present, all of them began by bearing hardship in order to achieve great undertakings, for bitterness contains the secrets to success and the elements of happiness. If we cannot bear hardship, not only will it be difficult to seek a state of joy, but we may even achieve nothing! Moreover, in this current period, we should bear the bitterest of the bitter, working diligently and persistently in all things, and only then can we obtain brightness. As the saying goes, "After bitterness comes sweetness." I wish to share this with the readers.</p>
<p>(2) Suffering Losses: Just as bearing hardship is described above, suffering losses is also something we should accept. The proverb says, "Suffering a loss is a gain." For example, if we suffer a loss today and a loss tomorrow, the other party may take full advantage, but discerning people will know it and will definitely not allow them to take advantage to the end. Moreover, now that we have suffered a loss, we should especially study where the loss lies, strive to improve, improve the direction of our work, and correct our own behavior, so that we have no shame towards ourselves or others. Even if we suffer some small losses temporarily, the result may be a great gain.</p>
<p>The taste of the above two types of eating may not be excellent, but the aftertaste is like eating admonitory fruit. I urge everyone to boldly try it, and you will surely benefit from it. Finally, I will add a couplet: "One who can bear hardship is a person of high ideals; one who is willing to suffer a loss is not a fool." I hope we will all remember this.</p>
<h3>People in the Same Boat Don't Sympathize with Each Other</h3>
<p>— Jinghuan</p>
<p>Beggar: Young master, young mistress, please give a small amount of money to do a good deed.</p>
<p>Young Master: So young and doesn't do anything to earn a living. Why beg?</p>
<p>Young Mistress: Disgusting thing.</p>
<p>Beggar: I was originally a clerk, but I was laid off due to downsizing, so I had no choice...</p>
<p>Young Master: Get lost! I don't have any small change. You were born to beg.</p>
<p>(The beggar walks away, scolded)</p>
<p>Young Master: (Triumphantly) I've seen plenty of this kind of thing. Always the same routine.</p>
<p>Young Mistress: After the company was dissolved, has the position that you asked Mr. Jin to recommend you for been settled yet?</p>
<p>Young Master: (Frustrated) Hmm...</p>
<h3>Huxley on the Problem of Human Immortality — One of the Letters of World-Renowned Scientists</h3>
<p>— Lincoln Schuster Translated by Guxin</p>
<p>I know very well that ninety-nine percent of my friends will call me an atheist, a Christian, and other normally embarrassing names. According to the position taken by our laws, if the lowest thief stole my clothes, my testimony (even though my opinions are well known) would not be accepted and would be to his disadvantage.</p>
<p>But I can't control these things. One thing people will not fairly call me is—a liar. Just as you said about yourself, I also feel that I lack courage; but if the time ever comes when I have to speak, I will not shame my children.</p>
<p>I am speaking to you now with more frankness and clarity than I have ever spoken to an individual, except for my wife.</p>
<p>If you can point out any errors in my premises or conclusions, I am prepared to abandon these words, just as I would abandon any other theory. But in any case, you must be fair to me and believe that I have not noticed the importance of these issues and have therefore not reached a conclusion.</p>
<p>I am writing this letter with extra pleasure because I know very well that if that great tool of good and evil, the Church of England, is to be preserved and not be shattered by the advancing tide of science—a fact that I would be very sorry to see, but that will certainly not happen if people like Samuel Oxford guide her future—then people like you must make efforts to unite the practicality of the church with the spirit of science. You must understand that the young scientists I know all think exactly like me. (I know that there is not a single mocker among them, nor a single irreligious or immoral person. You are their view of orthodoxy, just as you are of Brahmanism.) You must understand that this new school of prophecy is the only school that can work miracles, and the only school that can constantly appeal to nature and seek correct evidence. And you must also remember that it is useless to try to block us with clerical wide-brimmed hats and aprons, or to say that our doctrines are "horrific."</p>
<p>I dare not admit that I understand the logic of you, Maurice, and others of your ilk, but I have often said that I would swear by your faithfulness and honesty that your efforts must be able to achieve good results. However, the clearer this is to me, the more clearly I can see the necessity, the necessity for you to see where scientists are striving. I have long wanted to write such a letter to you.</p>
<p>If I have said anything too frankly or too abruptly, please forgive me, and please speak to me in the same way.</p>
<p>My wife thanks you very much for the collection of lectures you sent her. —Forever very loyal to you.</p>
<p>T.H. Huxley</p>
<p>September 23, 1860, 14 Waverley Place.</p>
<p>Aftermath: Thomas Huxley's clear and courageous exposition has become a classic statement. It shows the attitude of scientists when seeking truth, which is an attitude of tending towards free inquiry and unconstrained investigation. After this letter was written, a son was added to the Huxley family, giving some comfort to the mother who was grieving the loss of her son. (End of this article)</p>
<h3>Exhibition of Famous Porcelain from Past Dynasties</h3>
<p>— Huang Zhaoping</p>
<p>Chinese porcelain has always occupied a place in the world history of art. However, the creations of past dynasties have become fewer and fewer as the years pass. Collectors who happen to acquire something often treasure it as much as precious gems and do not easily show it to others. Mr. Dai Runzhai of Liangxi Haitain has been studying Chinese porcelain for over twenty years. His appraisal is precise and thorough, and his collection is rich, making him a prominent master. He is now publicly exhibiting his lifelong collection of famous porcelain from the Jin, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties at the Majestic Theater Building, No. 996 Jing'an Temple Road, for one week. Among them are many rare treasures that are not easily seen elsewhere. His spirit of making art public is commendable.</p>
<p>Among the exhibits are many Yue ware pieces from the Jin Dynasty. Examining the famous kilns of past dynasties in our country that are recorded in books, the Eastern Ou kiln of the Jin Dynasty is actually the oldest. Therefore, the items displayed are extremely valuable. The next is Chen's Changnan, which is now the world-renowned Jingdezhen kiln. Among the Tang Dynasty kilns, the Yue kiln was the most important, followed by the Xing kiln. In the Five Dynasties, apart from the Yue kiln's secret-color ware, the Chai kiln was unique. The Northern Song Dynasty had the most famous kilns, such as those made by the Ding, Jun, Dong, Ru, Guan, Longquan, and Ge kilns. They were ancient, simple, refined, and elegant, and all were lovely. The Peng kiln ware of the Yuan Dynasty, made by Peng Junbao in Huozhou, imitated the Ding kiln ware and was also a fine product. Among the Ming and Qing dynasties, the Jingdezhen kiln ware was the most numerous.</p>
<p>The grandest view of colored porcelain is from the Ming and Qing dynasties. Among those made in the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty, the semi-bodiless sweet white ware was the most important. The method of floral pattern engraving was the first of its kind, and the sacrificial red was also unprecedented, but the bright red was ultimately the most valuable. The gemstone red and azure of the Xuande period, and the Muhammadan blue of the Zhengde period were all famous. The iron-red of the Jiajing period can be considered a characteristic of the era. The new porcelain of the Wanli period had rich and bright colors and crude painting, but it also had a natural charm that should not be completely negated. During the Qing Dynasty, the imperial kiln ware of the Kangxi, Yongzheng, and Qianlong reigns was beautiful, exquisite, and superior to those of the past. For example, the Zang kiln and Lang kiln of the Kangxi reign, and the Nian kiln of the Yongzheng reign, were all wonderful because they were made during a time of prosperity, wealth, and excellent craftsmanship. The Qianlong official kiln was supervised by Tang Ying, who was learned and knowledgeable, with a unique and ingenious mind. Everything he made was exquisite and unparalleled, and the exquisite painting had the merit of carrying on the past and opening up the future. The famille rose was like a lifelike sketch and was also a unique creation. Generally speaking, among the famous colors of the three reigns, the Kangxi reign had the most bright red, and the sky blue, emerald green, delicate yellow, powder yellow, and blown red, blown purple, blown blue, and blown green were especially beautiful. The blue and white and wucai continued the tradition of the Xuande and Chenghua periods of the Ming Dynasty and were even more impressive. Although the enameled porcelain originated in the Zang kiln, Tang Ying surpassed it by making the blue even better than the blue. Therefore, those who view Qing porcelain generally consider the Tang Ying era to be the heyday of the development of the official kiln, and there is good reason for this.</p>
<p>The famous porcelain of past dynasties in this exhibition is divided into four major rooms, presenting a systematic introduction according to the evolution of the times and the advancement of craftsmanship. It not only promotes the creative spirit of our ancestors but also expresses the evolution of cultural relics of past dynasties, which is of profound significance. Don't miss the rare treasures that are not easily seen.</p>
<h3>Model Teacher for All Ages</h3>
<p>— James Hilton Translated by Yijin</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>What Mrs. Wilgatt let him was a small, comfortable, and sunny room. The house itself was ugly to the point of being almost non-existent. But that didn’t matter. It was convenient — that was the main thing. Because, if the weather was mild, he liked to stroll over to the playing fields one afternoon and watch the students play. He liked to smile and chat with the students, who would raise their hands to their hats in salute. He wanted to know all the new students, so he invited them for tea in their first semester. He often ordered a steamed walnut cake from Reddaway's shop in the village, covered with pink icing, and in the next semester, there were crispy scones—piled up in a small heap in front of the stove, soaked in cream so that the bottom one looked like it was placed in a small, shallow pool. His guests found it amusing to watch him make tea—carefully matching it spoonful by spoonful from different tea canisters. He would ask the new students where they lived and if they had any relatives with ties to Brookfield. He was always careful to keep their plates full, and after an hour; at five o'clock, he would look at the clock and say, "Um—er—it's been—er hum—very pleasant being with you—er hum—but unfortunately—er hum—you can't stay a moment longer. …" He would smile, shake hands with them in the porch, and let them run across the road to the school, criticizing as they went. "Decent old chap, Chips. Anyway, he gives you a jolly good tea, and you certainly know when he wants you to clear out…" Social service</p>
<h3>Celebrating Longevity and Relieving Poverty</h3>
<p>The weather has been severely cold these past few days, and poor people have no clothes or food. Nothing is more painful than this. The readers of this newspaper have shown compassion and have promoted the Poverty Relief Fund movement, which is gradually becoming widespread. Yesterday, the colleagues of the China Industrial Bank sent a donation of 500 yuan for poverty relief and said in a letter: "The colleagues planned to give a gift to Mr. Chen Yangzuo to celebrate his thirtieth birthday. Mr. Chen firmly refused and instead converted it into 500 yuan of national currency to be used by your newspaper for emergency relief for the hidden poor, to create blessings for Mr. Chen." This act by the bank's colleagues, saving money to relieve poverty, is of profound significance. We sincerely hope that all sectors will emulate this, so that poor and sick compatriots will benefit greatly.</p>
<h3>Report on Poverty Relief Funds</h3>
<p>(1) Xu Shouming, Zhu Wenhua, Gong Yunsheng, Zhu Dongyang, Zhang Wenxi, and others donated 50 yuan each. (2) Tang Zijing donated 40 yuan. (3) Zhou Yingong, Zhang Hou, Chen Fuzhai, Ye Dingru, Zheng Wanlu, and others donated 30 yuan each. (4) Shi Gengsheng, Jiang Botang, Hu Yizhong, and others donated 20 yuan each.</p>
<p>All of the above gentlemen are employees of the China Industrial Bank. They donated a total of 500 yuan, which, together with the previous balance of 9,657 yuan.</p>
<h3>Locations of Congee Distribution Centers in Shanghai</h3>
<p>A survey of charitable organizations in Shanghai that are providing congee distribution services is as follows:</p>

The congee tickets can be used at congee shops in both concessions. For the elderly, weak, and disabled, their family members can collect the tickets on their behalf with proof. Poor people in the Nanshi district can obtain a letter of certification from the neighborhood chief. Certificates can be obtained every day.</p>
