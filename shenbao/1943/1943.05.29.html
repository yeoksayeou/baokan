<p>社評</p>
<h3>「人力交流」</h3>
<p>目前歐洲戰局將臨近決戰階段，軍事上雙方各出全力爭取最後勝利，同時，在政治外交方面，也展開最後角逐的形勢，各期於自身戰局有利。反顧我們東亞戰局，雖經友邦日本業已奠定勝利基礎，但敵人之不甘從此休止，亦爲意想中事，而不可忽略者。所以，今後我們將如何加强太平洋之防務，將如何貢獻一切人力物力於完遂戰爭，都是參戰國家共同的責任。</p>
<p>我們中國正式參加大東亞戰爭，快要五個月了。其間國民政府對於政治經濟的體制與政策，都以參戰爲前提，而作種種建立和實施的整備。同時，日本也積極推行對華新政策，强化國府地位，俾充分發揮和運川權職，而以加强協同作戰的力量爲最終鵠的。關於這一點，我們在對敵決鬭，同生共存的戰綫上，每個同盟國分子；都應當瞭解，而各自對政府所施政策，竭誠遵從與擁護的。</p>
<p>可是，我們試加反省，就以上海一地而言，政府是否對於戰時體制與施策，巳經整備完成。人民是否對於政府施策，已經瞭解而遵從和擁護。我們實在不敢作肯定的答案。僅僅「豪華猶昔」的一點，已足證明上海不像戰時國家的都市，而看不出人民有戰時生活的情緒。這種現象，究竟還是「上行下效」呢？還是「麻木不仁」呢？我們不暇作此淸算，我們必須警惕着當前的決戰形勢，爲爭取勝利，爭取生存，奮起昨死今生的精神，從今而後，上下一體，澈底實踐戰時生活，尤其是在上者率先倡導，以身作則，然後才能眞正的貢獻一切人力物力於國家，才能眞正的協同參戰，才能眞正的取得勝利以後的國家地位。</p>
<p>我們基於上列論斷，更就目前的實際情形而言，中國參戰所能盡的義務，只能及於經濟的一方面。對於軍事方面，還仗日本獨任艱巨。因此，我們對於經濟方面所可貨獻的人力物力，就應盡最大的可能以赴。這裏，我們且舉一個「人力交流」的事例以言：</p>
<p>（一）因充實戰爭必需的物資與工具，而需要增加生產能率，除盡量利用機械以外，同時還須利用人力，以補不足。這種人力，允須具備適富的技能經騐，俾可增加工作效率。例如戰時最感需要的運輸工具，如輪船，火車，汽車，雖大量生產，仍感不够，或因鋼鐵原料不敷，减少產量，於是就須製造木船，木壳車輛以補不足，更因機械動力的不敷，就須以人力補充。</p>
<p>（二）農業方面，如新式農具之使用，種籽之改良，耕作技術之硏究；礦業方面，如探礦，採礦，煉礦；工業方面，如節省動力，增加產量，在在需要科學技術之指導與推行。</p>
<p>對於上舉二例，中國所需要的，是日本所有的技術專家，以及科學研究結晶之方法；而日本所需要的，是中國所有的大批工人，尤其是熟練工人。在這種塲合，於互惠互利條件之下，就需要彼此間的「人力交流」。中國則聘請日本的技術專家，協助發展農礦工業的生產。日本則雇用中國技工，協助增加必需品的生產，而雙方的目的，則又同一是增加戰時資源，爭取戰爭勝利。</p>
<p>至於「人力交流」實施時，爲期進行順利，袪除誤會，應遵守如下的原則：</p>
<p>（一）絕對公開，列明需要人員之技能條件，及給予之待遇，使自動志願參加。</p>
<p>（二）待遇一項，應包括聘用人員本身及其家屬全部生活費用，並應給予確實保障，俾使安心服務。</p>
<p>（三）介紹或招聘事務，應請由當地社會公正團體代辦，或主持辦理，純粹義務性質，不取中間利益，</p>
<p>此外，我們在中國人的立塲而言，「人力交流」問題，縱使不以增强戰爭力量爲目標，僅爲提高國人科學技術的知識，準備未來發展農工業，復興國家，也是極其値得實行的事。近年日本對於工農業方面科學技術之埋頭硏究，精益求精，已爲世人所驚讚，國人如能實地硏習，則於增高木身技能以外，目前可爲大東亞戰爭的出力人員，將來可爲復興中國的產業勇士，誠一舉而數得。同時，我們能延聘日本專家來華，作科學技術之指導，其目標正與去國工作者相同。利己利人，何樂不爲！</p>
<h3>日俄戰役　三十八年前本報之紀載　舊報新抄（九）</h3>
<p>引言</p>
<p>我們認淸今後保衛太平洋，將全是亞洲人的責任，再不容許英美揷足侵略勢力。不過，克盡保衛的任務，端賴强大的海軍力量。友邦日本建立海軍，歷數十年辛勤經營，不斷精進。在三十八年前的日俄戰役中，以寡克衆，初露頭角。此次大東亞戰爭中，更發揮了所向無敵的威力。而目前太平洋整個防務，由友邦海軍獨任艱鉅，我們未能稍爲分勞，殊深愧作。因此，我們今後將如何以友邦海軍爲模範，建立中國新海軍，參加防衛太平洋的任務，實爲國人所應共同急起直追的努力目標。本報爲增進國人海軍知識與興趣，特將三十八年前日俄戰爭時本報紀載，　爲新吵，自廿一日至三十日止以十日爲期，尙祈讀者注意爲幸。</p>

<h3>名將譚心（載本報第一一三九八號光緒三十年十二月初二日西曆一九〇五年一月七日禮拜六）</h3>
<p>昨日中午本館得日本東京友人專電云：華曆十一月三十日淸晨鐘鳴九下，日旅順陸軍總統乃木希典與俄之降將司堵瑟爾會於水師營，（地名非水師屯泊處也）司堵瑟爾以日軍精悍勇敢，深爲贊賞，且稱乃木將軍運籌帷幄，智勇絕倫，不勝欽佩，言次，復致謝代發電音入奏俄皇之雅意，曁日本天皇之厚待降人。乃木希典曆述其子一仁爲中尉，一仕爲陸軍少尉，皆以爲國捐驅。司堵瑟爾揮淚不止曰：此亦爲父母者之光也，將軍眞盛名蓋世哉。譚畢，乃木希典留司堵瑟爾及日俄兩參贊同桌午餐，饌旣撤，司堵瑟爾將所乘之阿臘比亞名馬奉贈，乃木希典一笑却之曰：此亦軍實之一也，義不敢受。司堵瑟爾固請，乃用軍隊之名受之。的以此後當用心愛護，見馬如見故人也。迨午後鐘鳴一下一刻，司堵瑟爾乃握別而歸。</p>

<h3>日大使谷正之在平談　日本對華根本方針　協助國府強化對華澈底協力　課稅權移讓問題積極進行中</h3>
<p>北京二十八日中央社電　日駐中國大使谷正之氏，於二十八日下午五時，在此間接見中外記者團，說明日本對於中國之根本方針，係以協助國府強化爲中心，而對中國國事澈底協力，並表明日方於最近繼交還租界之後，將課稅權交還中國。大意謂：華北在中國國務經濟以及地理上，與日滿兩國關係至切，所居地位，亦極重要，日政府在中國參戰以後，仍以中日互讓爲立塲，並深知必須深切實踐同生共死，始有效果，故日政府根據道義之施策，亦積極付諸實施。前者已經實行交還租界，關於課稅權之移讓問題等，正亦在積極進行中，因欲從速實行，故事先必須愼重將事。日本過去之對中國外交，係以中華民國爲舞臺，其實則以英美爲對象，迨大東亞戰爭以後，因已將英美勢力澈底廓淸，恢復日本與中國之本來立塲，而可進謀努力於大東亞共榮圈之建設。日本能以道義外交，繼續在物資與精神兩方面援助中國，則確信中國國民，必將明瞭根本之眞意，而完成相互協力之目的。</p>
<p>北京二十八日中央社電　日本駐華大使谷正之氏就任後，爲視察華北各地實况，於二十七日來平，二十八日上午九時赴神社及西本願英寺靈奉安所參拜，九時五十分召集使領及全體職員訓示，並聽取各部長報吿現况，十二時訪問華北軍岡村最高指揮官有所商談，又赴華北政委會訪問朱委員長。下午一時朱委員長在政委會設宴招待谷犬使，會後繼至日本大使館海軍武官府滿洲國大使館及德義法各國大使館訪問，五時在旅邸接見中日記者，當晚設宴招待中日滿德義各國各界要人，賓主極爲歡洽，至九時許始散。</p>
<h3>日空軍猛襲牽牛嶺　宜昌日軍展開出岳戰</h3>
<p>漢口二十八日中央社電　據華中日軍某前綫基地電訊，日步兵精銳部隊，自對據守揚子江上游宜昌西南方之渝江防軍三師開始進攻後，刻已將彼等完全包圍，日空軍部隊並協力地上部隊，於二十八日痛炸據守牽牛嶺（宜昌西方的二十公里）山險拚死頑抗之渝軍，並以機槍掃射，使之陷於紊亂，同時並隨地痛擊欲行逃出包圍網之渝軍，使其企圖悉成泡影。是時會發現渝軍大編隊，向長陽西北的十五公里之州家口木橋溪附近集結，乃即痛予轟炸使之殲減，</p>
<p>漢口二十八日中央社電　日軍各部隊，將憑據巴山山脈峻嶮之渝江防軍三師三萬人包圍後，並攻陷宜昌附近之雨臺山羅家壩兩要衝，而完成制壓宜昌峽之態勢，現日軍仍在各地展開山岳戰中，且進攻渝方內地之態勢，亦已準備就緒。緣日軍本準備進攻渝第六戰區根據地常德，但又突然轉攻進抵宜昌前方，發揮機關化部隊作戰之威力，此實出渝軍意外。日軍當即排除渝軍抵抗向前挺進，渝方唯一所恃之天然峻險要隘，在日軍猛攻之前，毫無何等效果，謀地一帶民衆，於日軍開到後，已能安居樂業，此影響渝方治下之民衆者，至深且巨，渝方爲圖挽回頽勢，特出動飛機助戰，但終未能阻止日軍，瞬息之間，日軍即奪取連結長陽漁洋關雨臺山宜昌峽之重要防綫，並加以確保，日軍現正準備猛攻渝方之心腹部分。</p>
<p>漢口廿八日中央社電　據長江流域日軍某地電訊，日軍此次向宜昌方面之渝「第六戰區」展開夏季攻勢以來，巳予渝軍以重大打擊，日海軍部隊，並於宜昌上流，截獲英美所屬船舶多艘後，從容返防，渝方對此，至爲狼狽，此次所截獲之敵方船舶，計有池和沙市湘華等輪，暨小型油槽船躉船客船拖船小火輪水上船渠等，共五十二艘。</p>
<h3>日駐華軍一週戰况</h3>
<p>南京二十八日中央社電日駐華派遣軍，二十八日發表一週戰况稱：日軍自勘定所謂『洞庭湖北岸湖南倉穀地區』之池沼地區後，陸空精銳，更急追殘敵，以期予以徹底之殲滅，同時並展開新行動。漁陽關按該地爲渝第六戰區之第一關門，爲重要供應基地，完全佔領渝第八十六師之據點長陽，刻戰爭芷繼續擴大中。最近渝軍內部，戰力低下，至於不可收拾之狀態，蓋於此次作戰中，即可察知渝軍相互間，毫無速繫，在日軍精銳之猛烈攻擊下，隨時隨地，悉趨潰滅，此足證渝方戰力但下，將士間之厭戰氣氛濃厚。在此次作戰中，得國府鄒平凡軍始終協力，擊潰頑敵，廿二日正午完全佔領渝第一百八十五師之據點宜都。又華北方面會將渝楊友伯部屬一千五百人，完全解除武裝，吳化文將軍部下國府山東方面軍精銳及其他歸順軍隊，悉皆參加，擊碎渝軍之作戰，積極活躍，獲得莫大戰果。華北展開中之今春太行山作戰，已徹底潰滅石太綫以南地區之共產軍，獲得莫大戰果，並於本月廿日停戰終了，陸軍航空部隊連日在各地與地上部隊作緊密之協力，前後二度轟炸衡陽，復專驅急襲建甌之渝方軍事設施。</p>

<h3>三竝貞三少將發表　日航空母艦發展史</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　前日海軍航空部隊司令官三　貞三少將，於二十七日海軍紀念日發表「日本航空母艦發展史」一文，歷史經過足供參考，茲識錄如次：</p>
<p>「以商船改造爲航空母艦」新式航空母艦之產生，尙僅爲三十年前即大正二年（民國二年）之事，當時爲欲進一步利用飛機之偵察力作海上戰鬥，乃開始用商船改造，以之搭載飛機，此爲航空母艦產生之初期。世界各海軍國之着手於空母之研究，始於此時，日本亦係於大正二年首將商船「若宮」改造爲水上機母艦，以之搭較卡基斯克法爾，曼式水上偵察機，翌年之靑島戰役中，此艦即曾參加作戰，發揮威力。當時之飛機總數僅有十二架，驅逐員亦僅十五人，以此與今日之日本海空軍實力相較，誠有不勝今昔之感。</p>
<p>「搭載陸上飛機之研究」飛機之研究，經第一次世界大戰後，已大見進步，即不僅用作偵察，且在攻擊方面亦巳顯示其特具之威力。因此，以輕快而具有强大攻擊之陸上飛機載於艦上，使之於洋中隨時隨地起落一事，已起各國之重大注意，根據此項要求，日本遂亦開始進一步研究水上飛機母艦。及至大正八年十二月，遂開工建造「鳳翔」號，至大正十一年十二月竣工，惟因該艦噸數僅九千五百噸，速力僅二十五海里，且艦長亦僅五十五公尺，寬十五公尺，故飛機在此甲板上起落頗爲困難。其後經二年間之種種實騐及操縱者之精心訓練指導，迨大正十三年，始編入艦隊，至此，日本海軍方正式有航空母艦（改造戰艦爲空母），「赤城」「加賀」兩艦之建造，動工於大正九年十二月，而其改造爲航空母艦，則爲昭和二年三月，其間歷五年四月方始竣工。巡洋艦「加賀」戰艦「赤城」之所以急遽改造爲空母者，實因軍縮會議結果，主力艦遭受限制，而不得不廢棄所致。當時關於空母之建造各國，無不嚴守秘密，潛心研究，故「赤城」「加賀」之改造，亦會屢經改良，且根據「鳳翔」之實戰經騐，重加設計，故所需時日頗久。該兩空母之編入艦隊，乃昭和三年事，此後日本海軍亦始得利用飛機作戰及實行正式訓練。</p>
<p>「日本空母之獨特戰術」　軍縮會議之五五三比率，亦同樣適用於航空母艦，故英。美爲十三萬五千頓，日本爲八萬一千噸，在此限度內，建造新空母，又分爲大型與小型二種，大型者艦數少，小型者艦數多，結果美國採用者爲二萬噸之大型母艦形式，日本採用者則爲一萬噸之小蒼龍型形式，以謀用此對抗美國，從此航空方面之「日月火水木金金」遂亦開始。當時之航空本部技術部長即爲故山本元帥，該部對於母艦與飛機之操縱技術，艦載飛機之製造技術等，亦即在山本元帥之指揮下，竭力精益求精，迄此次開戰以前，我方之技術及訓練，可謂已有最高之水準。</p>
<p>「廢止空母之一段揷話」　當倫敦軍縮會議時，曾一度有廢止空母之提議，惟美國最先即提出反對，窺其用意，不外欲使其較優於日本之空母遠度太平洋，以從事進攻作戰，而仍於被日本空母一舉擊滅其夏威夷主力艦隊者，當非彼等始料所及。</p>
<h3>華盛頓會議結束　邱吉爾回國後將發表詳報　台維斯携斯達林長函返美</h3>
<p>里斯本二十八日中央社電據華盛頓消息，白宮發表關於羅斯福。邱吉爾會議之公報，僅謂已獲得完全一致，故反軸心陣營原冀從該宣告中得覘反軸心將來作戰之動向者，皆感覺失望。白宮之宣告僅云：「最近在華盛頓舉行之聯合僚幕會議業已結束，關於各戰綫之將來作戰，巳獲得完全一致」。羅斯福總統之秘書歐萊昨晚在白宮招待報界，宣讀公報後即謂：「余可以爲諸君吿者，僅此而已」。據路透社稱：羅斯福總統與邱吉爾首相原定共同發表一文吿，但其後又決定以羅斯福之名義發表該簡知之宣吿，該宣吿在發表前曾吾經邱吉爾寓目亦未可知，歐萊稱：反軸心領袖係在昨日最後之一刻始決定此項新辦法。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十八日中央社電　海通社訊，倫敦消息靈通之政界人士昨稱：英相邱吉爾自華盛頓返國後，將發表關於華盛頓會談之群細經過，此後英下院將舉行辯論三日。</p>
<p>莫斯科二十八日中央社電　斯達林二十六日夜將用俄語書寫之致羅斯福長函，手交台維斯特使，台維斯旋即携該函自莫斯科啓程退赴華盛頓。</p>
<h3>山本元帥雖死猶生</h3>
<p>— 德富豬一郎</p>
<p>將星自天而墜，世界上任何人都爲之驚咤。若說是意外，那眞是意外之至。自昭和十六年十二月八日對英美頒發宣戰大詔以來，山本聯合艦隊司令長官實爲日本陸海空軍功臣中的功臣者。自從震驚世界的襲擊眞珠灣以來，其作戰愈來愈妙，其豐功偉績，在古今世界海戰史上，無與倫此。上託大元帥陛下的天威，下頓將士的忠勇，其首腦者即係山本五十六其人。就使說山本五十六是大東亞戰爭中第一的英雄，亦非過　。</p>
<p>現在他不幸而陣亡了。然而他的陣亡，旣不是諸葛孔明的秋風五丈原，亦不是楠公的湊河。如强欲求例，納爾遜在特拉發加爾之役的戰死差可比擬。那就是以死來獲得勝利。而且他不單獲得了勝利，我們相信山本五十六永爲日本的一大軍神，担任了在太平洋的全面衛謹日水國威的新任務。</p>
<p>山本司令長官鬥志昻奮，連身是胆，滿腹珠璣，足智多謀，而一貫之以日本精神。他的先人山水帶刀在北越之軍中曾與河井繼之助力戰苦鬥。雖刀折彈盡，終不屈而從容就義。山本五十六的死，如和他的先人比較起來，更有千百倍的光榮，同時也是有效果的死。像他的死，可稱是死得其所了。</p>
<p>日本海軍中，人才濟濟，喪了一個山本五十六，更有許多的山本五十六。我們決不因無後繼者而苦惱。在一切人類的一生中，沒有人在山本這樣短的時間中，成就了這樣大的戰功。從此點看來，他在九泉之下，亦可瞑目了。他把現實世界的舞台讓之他人，自身則爲幽靈界的鬼雄，爲軍神，爲了日本，他在太平洋上—印度洋亦在內—當守護之神。他賜以殊恩，被列於元帥府，叙一級金鴿勳章，賜國葬，身後哀榮，可謂至矣。如其我們中間有人因他的死而失望沮喪，決不是安慰他的雄魂毅魄所應有的態度。如其我們要對他表示由衷的虔弔之情，我們便應請更熾烈地燃起戰鬥的精神，用以向擊滅英美的道路上邁進。</p>
<p>山本五十六是死了。可是他的死是人的死，如當他是軍神，他還活着。如楠公一樣活着，如東鄉元帥一樣活着。他的英靈，決不會埋葬在海底。我們在新的聯合艦隊司令長官之下，將見到新局面的展開。（翔：驛五　二十三日東京每日新聞）</p>
<h3>日本海海戰與太平洋海戰</h3>
<p>— 富永謙和</p>
<p>（四）給與近代海戰戰術的敎訓</p>
<p>日本海海戰　是最初的近代海戰，其結果所及於近代海戰的影　，極爲重大。</p>
<p>近代戰爭，絕對需要舉國輿　的支持，而帶有總力戰的傾向。這可說以日俄戰爭開其端。</p>
<p>其次，日俄戰爭證實了日本海軍是維持遠東和平之決定的要素。</p>
<p>至於就軍備武裝方面而言，海戰的勝敗，被決定於參加決戰兵員力量的多寡，也於此獲得證明。這成爲以後五·五·三比率之有力的某礎。換句話說，能否進攻，不在於兩國問距離的問題，而以保有量的大小如何爲主。海岸綫的長短和警備範圍的廣狹等，不是決定保有量大小的根據。一國的保有量就等於該國的決戰兵力。</p>
<p>又因此可驚的戰果，巨砲單一主義，在戰後的列强海軍中風　一時對想以主砲進行決戰的傾向更加上一層刺激，而出現了努級艦時代。船體的構造也因此而起變化，重視防禦，增加耐彈性，同時，砲彈加以改良，並延伸砲戰距離，以與之對抗，海戰戰術上產生了一次大變化。</p>
<p>（五）日本海海戰與大東亞海戰</p>
<p>三十八年前的日本海海戰與現在的大東亞海戰比較起來，從其規模和戰塲的大小而言，從兵器之進步的程度，尤以新兵器的活躍而言，從戰術的變化而言，是極困難的問題。有不同點，也有許多共同點類似點。</p>
<p>戰塲的廣大，原可舉爲海戰的特質之一，日本海海戰的塲合，戰塲可說幾局限於日本海方面</p>
<p>敵方的太平洋艦隊，以海參崴或旅順港爲根據地，不過用以威脅軍隊的運輸。即使出動到太平洋，也止於在日本東岸一帶游弋，雖有增援的波羅的海艦隊，其目的也祗在和海參崴的殘餘艦隊併合，所以其行動範園始終未曾越出日本海。</p>
<p>然而此次的作戰海面，東起夏威夷，美　　　　，南至　　東岸，四至馬達伽斯加島，北至阿留申方面，且太平洋，印度洋兩大洋，地球上過半的海面成爲戰塲，從其廣狹之點而書，眞有宵壤之別。</p>
<p>兵器的進步，其相差的程度也無從比較。首先拿艦型的增大來說：旗艦三笠在當時已算是日水最强最大的兵艦了，然排水量不過一萬五千二百噸，主砲是十二吋。現在的三萬五千噸主力艦，首尾綫上搭載十六吋大砲，和以前的比較起來，有如小巫之見大巫。射程的加大，火藥的改良等，也右很大的進步。</p>
<p>造艦，造軍器技術的發達，及通俗兵器，魚雷，機電等，在防禦力及連力方面，都有異常的進步。</p>
<p>而最顯著變化，是新兵器，特別是飛機，潛水艦的發達，以及繼之而來的戰術的立體化。</p>
<p>於是海戰戰術遂有了根本的變說。日俄戰爭中的海戰，經明治三十七年的二次海戰——黃海海戰與蔚山冲海戰，而以日本　　　　　　　一戰。在此次戰爭中，以開戰之初的夏威夷，馬來海戰起，經大小十餘决的諸海戰，迄今日止，已經擊沈了三倍於波羅的海艦隊的總噸數。美國海軍蒙此損失，雖不能說依然健在，但尙未屈服。</p>
<p>至少在第一次世界大戰以前，作爲主要兵器的艦艇，不僅其價値極高，且其建造塡補亦需要許多的資材與時日。一旦在集中全兵力的決戰中敗北，勢難在最短期問挽囘勢力。反之，短期間內可大量補充的航空兵力的登塲，在海上決戰的內容上，賦與了可驚的補給戰的性格，而能夠聯績決戰。</p>
<p>日俄海戰把全部保有兵力量提高至決戰兵力的地位，在現在，保有兵力自然仍有其必要，但在最近的將來，保有兵力亦不能不當作決戰兵力來加以考慮，那限度就是一切部門的國力。</p>
<p>可是從另一方面看來，蟄伏於警備嚴密的港灣內，作爲要塞艦隊，或作爲待機艦隊，以保全其勢力，在以前—例如旅順艦隊—是可能的，但至今日已不可能了。</p>
<p>那就是想解除强求決戰的困難的空中攻擊所及於近代海戰的特質，同時又可以說是速戰速決的矛盾的。</p>
<p>那麼，一舉而決定日本與廢的日本海海戰，將不復見於太平洋海戰嗎？（翔：　自「現代」五　　）</p>

<p>華中烟草配給組合，爲充分配給捲烟，以應正當需要，規定每月派貨三次，爲五日十五日二十五日，依照甲乙丙丁等貨卡，採一·二·四·八·制派貨·所派之貨，限各卸賣商及小賣商，平均分十日發售，絕對禁止國積及拒售情事。頃第六期派貨已於日前通知各卸賣商小賣商繳款提貨，捲烟以軍管理顧中公司及日商中華烟公司居多。規定丁卡貨値的三千元，丙乙甲各下依比例遞增，連日因充分配給及黃霉將屆，以及華中各地次第派貨等關係，轉販者已無利可圖。圍戶因恐發霉而不敢過分團積，以致黑市價格狂跌，而進戶寥寥，市上於供過於未趨勢。所以黑市價格，已與限價相差無幾。一般購買者購買限價烟，已較前爲易。但排隊軋烟之風未戢。至於該組合對（一）中請升級之小賣商，（二）申請登記配給之新烟商，業巳分別派員調査。一俟核准即行辦理。並聞新設之烟行號請求派貨，限五月一日以前登記者爲限，暫時對新請求者已予截止云。</p>

<p>林康侯致詞</p>
<p>澤田大使柳井，公使，中村公使，諸位來賓，今天承主賓及諸位來賓惠臨，深爲榮幸。我們知道澤田大使與重光外相，谷駐華大使，是很密切的知友，同時都是日本外交界的傑出人才。這次偕柳井公使來華視察，我們盼望大使多多觀察和聽取中國民間的意向，並且把這種意向帶回日本去，作爲今後日本進一步對華協力方針的主要根據，這方針才是最切實際的協力方針。上海市民福利協會，是代表上海市民謀求福利的，同時也是市民表示意向的機構。今天開會歡迎的意義，就在乎此。我們聽說澤田大使的令兄，也會出任過大使，昆仲兩大使，已很難得，而昆仲的面貌，又極相似，很容易認誤，國際外交界引爲美談。我們盼望大使於視察回國之後，把中國民間意向，傳達東京當局，中日邦交，從此更進一步。而昆仲大使，更象徵中日兩國，成爲東亞弟兄兩大國，協力擔任同樣的任務，引爲後此歷史上永久的美談，澤田大使，諒必樂於努力的。中村先生，駐華有年，爲中國之友，年來於中日邦交之親善，致力頗多。今榮轉駐芬蘭公使，我們盼望公使雖離中國，而於中日邦交，還繼續關心和協力。我們謹以至誠，於一面歡迎，一面歡送之餘，並祝諸位工作成功，身體健康。旋由澤田大使與張一鵬先生相糧致詞，至六時半散會。</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>提高限價</h3>
<p>來當局對於有幾種商品的限價，已經予以提高，例如黃金限價，已經提高到每兩五千元，報紙限價已經提高到每令九百五十元。一般人對於提高限價的原理，不加研究者，以爲限價旣已提高，則黑市價格，必將繼長增高。但是事實告訴我們，黑市的金價，早經跌進五千元的限價範圍；黑市的紙價，超出限價範圍，亦　渺乎其小。由此，可知提高限價，並不足以促成黑市物價的愈趨高漲；反之，有時倒可以促成黑市物價的低落。</p>
<p>因此，我們認爲提高限價，絕對砂是沒有意義的，因爲限價提高以後，其自然的結果爲：（一）商店　於在利潤上尙不過份吃虧，即不至藏貨不售，（二）購戶鋻於明市有貨可買，即不至求諸黑市，（三）黑市鋻於廳者　　，即不至國積居奇。故自理論上言，提高限價，實覺一學而三得。可是，提高限價，似宜以「適可而止」爲第一原則；所謂「適可而止」的標準，就是在確定黑市中某種某種商品無由居寄的時候，便不當再事提高限價，而却當從事於限價的减低，因爲厲行低物價政策，畢竟是統制經濟的一個主要目標。</p>
<h3>棉業專委會設立後　舊棉花收買機關解散　棉花棉製品概歸專委會統制</h3>
<p>全國商統總會物資統制審議委員會，自決定將棉花等四項主要商品列入編製物品範圍以內之後，對於棉花之編製需要一新的機構，負責辦理，而原由日方組織之「華中棉花編製總會一及棉花收買機構，必須解散，將編製事務，移交與商統會籌備辦理。茲悉商統會關於棉業方面旣已設有專業委員會，故經有關方面協議結果，決將此棉花編製工作，亦交予棉業專業委員會負責進行，期與棉製品之編製工作，打成一片。開關於此事之大體內容如下：</p>
<p>（一）商統會下之棉業專業委員會，爲棉花及棉製品之最高統制</p>
<p>（二）綿業專業委員會之構成份子，爲華商之棉花同業聯合會，蘇浙皖棉製品同業聯合會，及日商之棉製品同業聯合會曁日商棉花同業聯合會。</p>
<p>（三）棉製品部份，由中日雙方同業聯合會設置一協議會，棉花部份亦由中日雙方設置一協議會，以便聯絡。</p>
<p>（四）中日兩棉花同業聯合會，華商方面由紗廠聯合會，棉花同業公會及其他與棉花有關係之公會組成。日商方面由「在華紡績同業會」，「日商棉花局業組合一，曁其他與棉花有關係之同業組合組成。</p>
<h3>準備金存摺　可向中儲貼現</h3>
<p>滬市各匯劃錢莊前以銀根奇緊，週轉不靈，曾請求中央儲備銀行擬以存款準備金存摺抵借現金，中儲滬行以準備金存摺是否可能抵借現款，未敢擅自主張，經向財部請示之後，茲悉業經財部准予通融辦理，規定辦法：（一）以業經繳存之準備金百分之八十數額可出具本票，請求貼現。（二）票貼現期間以七天爲限。（三）貼現利率定爲每千元每月十二元計算，聞此種辦法即以貼現方式按八折抵押。</p>
<h3>本市地產激漲　地產公司設立頗多</h3>
<p>近來本市地產價格，因當局之嚴厲取締囤積投機，以致過　遊資，一時難獲出路，即向地產方面侵入，因此地產買賣，日趨繁忙，地產價格，亦不斷高漲。</p>
<h3>解體公會　須從速繳銷圖記</h3>

<p>棉布　棉紗市况，交易極爲淸淡，僅二十支略有成交，餘均少有問津，價殊平疲。棉布趨勢堅穩，晨初開時，浮多方面尙有　求，行朮步步上升，後因供方不弱，各布終比上日軋升。</p>

<h3>大公司練習生的透視</h3>
<p>— 正白</p>
<p>『練習生』，看這名字就比『學徒』來得『高雅』，何况是公司裏的？更何况是大公司裏的</p>
<p>我門終日在高房大厦內工作，（雖然晚上睡在自出租費的擱樓上）穿的是『整齊劃一』的制服，工作是寫字間的鐘點，還有外人想像中『輕　的工作』，『優厚的待遇』……這些這些，眞是太好了，你看提到大公司，誰人不羨慕？名氣之響，直透雲霄。然而有名者未必有實，這虛有的美名，外表，正不知引誘了多少靑年，去謀這只飯碗，而終於走上了狹窄的路。</p>
<p>你們不相信瑪？　！我們的制服費就是在我們薪津內扣去的。說到薪津，更是可憐，筆者『練習』已有二年，到現在每月才有二十餘元，還是幾次加薪二元的結果。我們公司內不供住宿，不供早勝，所以一月所得，每天喝一碗豆腐漿，也感不夠，邊論其也了。我們每天早晨先至公司內『　掃『橱』，然庭後搬出貨物，以待開市。以後我們就只聽見東也按鈴，西也按鈴，奔走疾　，忙得不亦樂乎。只恨自己不能化作千萬身，以免受責貨員們的白眼。我們也常要把笨重的貨物從四樓搬到地面，我們一　內已有人在患吐血了。打烊後把貨物再搬到指定的地方，然後播地，抺桌，揩玻璃……瑣碎的事情，我們也都得幹。一天辛苦夠了，晚間該讓我們有一點自修的機會。公司方面眞體貼，替我們組織了免費稱習班——『强迫補習』，和家長督促子弟一樣，可是內容只有英文，只教英文生字——都是些專鬥名詞，來路貨名。至於文法，曾話，都歸入『需要不殷』而『暫緩講解』了。我們每天要上一小時所謂『英文課』，這無異於要我們荒廢一小時。</p>
<p>我們的工作，生活，好像很苦了。然而我們並沒有諸說，我們總希望有出頭的日子。可是公司規定練習生至多升至賣貨員爲止，再上去就沒份兒了。賣貨員的待遇，和練習生相差不過數倍。要是不靠另做生意，也是很難維持生活的。這樣一來，店員不能安心工作，效率减少，公司損失也就可觀了。</p>
<p>儘管我們的飯碗不是『金飯碗』，『銀飯碗』。然而來搶奪的，可也不在少數。因此我們就常行被公司『另請高就』的可能，這問題就嚴重了。小商店裏的練習生，被老板解職後，已經獲得若千經騐。故天涯海角，總可設法有身。唯有我們這一羣，允其是浮酒，西服，等華貴　子裏的一羣，被解職後，只能在本地設法，若至小城市，就算你『練習』得爐火純靑，也是『英雄無用武之地』。因爲內地誰照顧得起你這高貴的生意呢？所以只好再從『學徒』做起，那未數年來的光陰，他就荒廢得不明不白了。</p>

<h3>面子的利害問題</h3>
<p>— 川我</p>
<p>『面子』人人要顧，是不可諱言的：儘管有些人背着別人幹下無恥的勾當，但也照樣在人油把『面子』掩飾得漂亮而完整，也許是比他人更爲講究，更爲『要』。是的，這未始不是一件『美德』，『差惡之心，人皆有之』，這『要面子』豈非不合於『差惡之心』歟？</p>
<p>有人說：『中國的社會秩序尙能在這動　的時候維持良好，實在因爲我們究竟是一個『禮義之邦』的緣故。』同時我確又時常聽見：『啊…面子關係…』，『唉…面子總不能…』由此我恍然悟到『面子』在中國社會上竟是人倫風紀的『保護老』了。不是嗎，爲了『要面子』，窮人就裝做有錢，於是社會上窮人就『少』了；爲了「要面子』，大家都在待人接物時極盡『禮讓』之能事，於是社會上便『一團和氣』，『熙熙樂樂』了；爲了『要面子』，便『哈…馬馬虎虎…』，『嘿囉，大家方便……』，於是天下事便『無往而不利』，而天下也就『太平』了。然而不幸是『有共利必有其弊』，因爲要『要面子』，大家面上便都無形地敷上了一層粉，久之便失知了天眞的本性而成爲一張張善於媚笑，善於奉迎，善裝威嚴，善戴假面……的怪臉了。我想，多數孩子的害怕生人，也評正因是入世未深看不慣這種『奇　』的緣故吧？</p>
<p>有人在責備一些人不該不顧人家的面子，而使人家太覺難堪，這固然可以給某些盛氣凌人的人一點指正，但却沒有料到有些外面擠着堂皇的『面子』而暗中無惡不作的人正是社會進展的最大障礙物，人類虛僞形成的最大罪犯呢！在我，假如有人當面指出我的錯誤，拉下我的假面子，給我『丢臉』，我倒樂於接受，而假使一味對我『講面子』，滿臉僞裝，到不禁要引起我的憤恨的：這是『　』，而不容於『禮儀社會』中也是必無疑的。</p>
<p>其實，祇要不是　　，不是意氣用事，而是正確的敎訓或指斥，　子——這紙轉的嗣人的中四——扯破了有什麽要緊？相反，爲了顥金對方的『面子』而不指責他的錯　，也假裝一副『面子』去迎合他，博他的高興，倒無異被壞了對我兩方的良心與人格！因此，與其活裝『面子』，死要『面子』，還不如丢掉了它，大家坦白地站出來說點眞話的好！否則，『禮讓』還未講完，社會早已是岌岌乎危哉的了</p>
<h3>現實理想和幽默</h3>
<p>— 淵谷</p>
<p>林語堂曾經說過，『幽默能使理想主義者不致把頭撞在現實的石壁上而受到了嚴厲的打擊，又使那些暴躁的熱心份子的緊張情緒緩和下來，使他活得長久些，』他的意思就是說現實確可支持崇高的智慧或思想。然而，幽默也是調整理想和實的工具，使他們得到適當的結合。</p>
<p>的確，一個專重實的人的地位是很穩固的，祇要他能了解他目前的一切而加以適當的努力，無論如何總不會遭到失敗的，不過這種生活是太單調了，太機械了，正　一個漁人的祇會釣魚一樣，一條竿子，一隻籠子就代表了他的一切，整天祇是呆坐在河旁，當然，籠內的魚是足夠他生活的，不過，他不知道現代新式的捕魚機在一分一刻之間就能捕得他幾天的魚，而所費的代價不足他的一半。</p>
<p>另一方面，一個理想派的人物決不會像前者的安定了，他們每天總是計劃着許多超越現實的題材，幻想着未來的一切，尤其是　於物質上的享受和精神上的愉快，抱若極大的希求和奢望；要知道這種希求和奢是　蓄着禍害的根苗的，以個人而論，這種過份的　望使他們從遭痛苦，廣而言之，假使民族也染有這種企望，那末整個社會就要動搖了</p>
<p>人生就是現實和理想的一種多型的混合物，假使混合得準確，適當，那未人生　有意思，而準確和適當是全靠幽默來調整的，正像一個工作了八小時的工人需要睡眠一樣，它能壓低你不必要的幻想，而把握現實；有時候會培養你的理想，而使你的現實獲得休息。</p>
<h3>出征（三）</h3>
<p>— 海軍報道班員　濱本浩著</p>
<p>五　俠客精神</p>
<p>『黑金號水雷艇的人們若是上了岸，即是中國城市裏愛哭的小叫化，據說也要悄悄地躱到床底下去。』</p>
<p>『也許沒有那樣厲害，但如果是胆小的兵卒，據說常常給讓路的。』</p>
<p>一聽到這樣談話，原來在粗　貨船上長大的江戶貫太耶，可以想像得到自己將來服務的水雷艇『黑金』號是具有何種性格的艦艇。</p>
<p>『喂，　；在沒有服務那艘艇以前，要替他爭氣的，』松前少尉這樣笑着觀，報道班員們總是替『黑金』號的性格，多少加上了些誇張的話。</p>
<p>『第一，那個艇長眞是一位怪人。艇長是南昌市空　難的有名樓木少校的同班和同年，後來轉到艦艇上來的。這一點我雖然不敢肯定其爲眞假，但我很知道他崇拜淸水决耶長，否則不會把他的像片掛在自己的臥室裏。』</p>
<p>『那究竟怎樣不敢說，但近來在練兵塲，他常用可怕的祖暴敎練法訓練兵士。你在傍邊站着看，也總會感覺出是黑金號的人。艇長往往突然由背後出現，而給大家講演。一切訓練，單純體裁好是不夠的。即使結果作得少微好，而精神如果沒有，那在戰塲中也是淺　。訓練並非是工作，而是精神，於是他就把祟拜的俠客淸水次　長一類的話，以及决郞長的軼事等講給大家聽。有時把軍需官招呼　，說兵士流汗過多，把咖啡倒入水桶讓他們喝吧！』『在南洋任何地方，都不會看到那種喝咖啡的方法。』有人這樣笑着說。</p>
<p>『也許沒有。然而結果，與其說是咖徘，莫如說是水。而兵士却被這位艇長的精神所感動。」</p>
<p>『聽說那位艇長只有兩個號令。』</p>
<p>『發見敵機時，就命令向上開火，發見敵人潛水艇時，就命令放水雷。』有人這樣說着，但說到向上開火和放水雷時還要　做發號令的神氣。</p>
<p>『然後就是指示砲手和水雷手到適常地方去，因爲總是得到戰果，所以他了不起！』</p>
<p>『這個話有點奇怪！』松前少尉突然提出抗議這樣說。</p>
<p>『然而因爲是小艦艇，在正式戰爭的條件上是談不到什麼的，』松前少尉又肯定了這樣一句。</p>
<p>『報道班員是否有乘過黑金號的呢？』南條這樣發問了一句</p>
<p>『我雖然沒乘過，忸和他們這一家人認識的很多。其中有先任將校大政，機關中尉小政等人。大政是劍道二段，小政是柔道四段，合起來是六段，他們常引此自豪。此外還有稱作夜中朝太耶者，據說他在海兵團是角力的選手。他是其中和人最親熱的。近來也！』</p>
<p>秃頭把腿伸直這樣說了。這批報道班員特別崇拜黑金號一家人這件事，從談話的最初也可以知道，</p>
<p>這是禿頭報道班員伸直腿講的『黑會一家』故事。</p>
<p>是一個月亮團圓的夜裏，該報這班員曾經到過山的中段赴宴會去過。</p>
<p>宴會塲在山背面的中部，距離艦艇碼頭有二公里的地方。香　四溢的淡紅色印度素馨花，以及八層瓣的馬蹄花，在晚上看也同樣美麗，而在窗邊盛開着。來到此處的士官們，稱這個可以遠眺全港的地方爲南洋的湼維斯山（英國最高山Ben　Nevis。士官室用作宴請登陸者與出征者的地方，往往搬來很多啤酒和罐頭食物，坐在日本內地式的蓆上，大吃大嚼。</p>
<p>『報道班員請來一下！』</p>
<p>一聽見被叫的聲音，望外一看，原來是『黑金號一家』的英雄豪傑們包圍着的自己艇長，大家的而孔上都露着怒容。</p>
<p>一面驚訝着說：『這究竟是怎麽一囘事呵？』一面不待屁股落在椅子上就說：『現在也正在讀一通報吿，是我的老前　，更詳細一點說，是我以前服務的驅逐艦的艦長。請原諒，不能發表姓名，是某部隊長的最後報吿，，大家聽者！』。突然表現出非常欽佩的神情，開始用脆快的聲音朗誦。</p>
<p>『由於敵軍砲火熾烈，我方陣地逐漸突破，我軍健兒不斷用衝鋒肉彈戰法反攻，雖然給與敵人巨大損失，但我方……』</p>
<p>莊重的低音中，並非故意帶着一點悲哀。</p>
<p>『同顧交戰四十餘日以來，不論軍人爽軍屬，各都盡其　盡的任務，非常感謝近來上司的指導，航空部隊的協力，以及陸軍的配合作戰。遙祝皇國的興盛與諸官之武運長久。完。』</p>
<p>閉着眼時朗誦的艇長，在兩頰上流着兩行熱淚。先任將校之大政以下，一時並未發聲，過了一個時候，機關長附小政中尉突然在灰白的面頰上顫動着，站起來說：『復仇，復仇！』</p>
<p>『不要着急！」</p>
<p>艇長在申斥他們這樣說。遂即問報道員說：『怎麼樣？沒有想出文章來麼？』</p>
<p>特意把報道班員們叫來，誦讀前輩的遺囑（現在已成爲遺囑）聽，一方面還可以從靠筆吃飯的報道班員處聽到各種感想，也許爲了證明自己的批判並沒有錯誤。</p>
<p>但富於情感的報道班員，從起初就很生氣地聽着，在內心裏從未想到文章的好壞。至於討論和批評，他們反覺是不應該的事</p>
<p>正在這個時候，指揮所突然發出警報聲音來。也許乘月夜，敵國偵察機來偵察。聽到警報後，一般說來，到敵機飛臨市空還有三十分鐘的時問。</p>
<p>雖然是這樣，但慌張的艇長，踢着蓆子表示說：『快點去！』</p>
<p>『還早，不着慌也可以吧！』</p>
<p>報道班員一面笑着這樣勸說。於是傍面站着的大政可憐的樣子在瞪着眼睛，而用力地說：</p>
<p>『我們不是躱警報，是囘到艇上準備迎擊。今天晚上，一架飛機也不讓他同去，都要打下來。』</p>
<p>這個話還未說完時，英雄豪傑們的影子，早已在屋子裏看不見了。（濤：譯自朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>日本海軍異聞錄（五）</h3>
<p>— 大下宇陀兒</p>
<p>明治三十八年五月二十七日午後一時五十五分，旗艦三笠號上高高地揭着一面全世聞名的信號旗：『　　的興慶在此一戰，各員更進一步富勵、努力呀！』</p>
<p>雖很簡短，但像這樣充滿着力的切實而雄潭的語句是　罕見的。無論在出事或戰鬥的塲合，各種各樣的命令都由此而出。</p>
<p>珊瑚島海戰中，以薩拉吐加，的克鎭二航空母艦爲中心，加上了戰艦北卡洛列那型和加利福尼亞型以英戰艦華斯拜特的敵方大機動部隊，被包圍於我艦隊及飛機的包圍鐵環中，不久，等到預定的決戰時機成熟時，〇〇　上的號長通過傳聲管對全部船員作如决的訓示：</p>
<p>『諸位！你們皆從訓練中鍛鍊成世界唯一的臂膊。現在諸位的訓練結實了。那臂　要顯顏色的時快了。幹！懷着自　幹！祇要如此，勝利是我們的！』，</p>
<p>艦長的語氣，堅强而着實，力的含蓄中，有一種如父親曉喩兒子般親切的聲氣。各員被那聲氣感動了，精神振奮起來，歡愉起來，勇氣如火般旺盛起來了。於是砲手向砲祈禱着，魚雷上灑上神酒，充滿着一發必中的自信，各就木位，完成了完全的戰鬥配置。</p>
<p>爪哇島科拉貢的北方洋上，擊沉英國甲級巡洋艦愛克賽泰號的時候，在尙沒有認清敵艦之前，〇〇驅逐艦的艦長，即已計算彼我的距離，知道在正午前後就要和敵艦接觸，於是想趁這時候使全體船員先行飽餐。遂發出。</p>
<p>『會員！　　！』</p>
<p>的命令。這就是這次戰鬥中的第一個命令。敵方是英國自誇的最新銳甲級巡洋艦，而且有驅逐艦隨從着。而我方祇有二艘　逐艦，竟敢向其挑戰，並瞬即把敵人擊沉於爪哇海的海底，愛克賽泰號是在南美　得維地洋上襲學德國袖珍戰艦格拉夫·斯此號的英國巡洋艦羣中之一，日本海軍中的一艘小驅逐艦，替盟邦報了仇。在開戰之初，我海軍飛機在馬來洋面又擊沉了威爾斯親王號，替德國戰艦俾斯麥號報仇。斯比上將號的艦長，及俾斯麥號殉國的德海軍勇士，他們的英魂，大概也在微笑罷！這是悲壯而美麗的海的揷語。</p>
<p>軍人與偉大的思想家，雄辯家，文學家不同，他們不擅長這些事件。軍人只知道勇往直前，只知道武人的天職，因而出了很多名將。</p>
<p>日俄戰爭的某海戰中，某艦長自始向全部船員沒有說過一句話。</p>
<p>後來終究開口了。只有一句語：</p>
<p>『諸位！好極了！趕上去！』</p>
<p>『好極了』是一句賞讚與激勵的話。從　稱頌吟詩的時候使用的。現在在軍事學校中，也常可以聽到這句語。（異：譯自西部朝日新聞。）</p>

<p>— 叔平</p>
<p>國語曰：『民生於三，事之如一，父生之，君食之，師敎之』。禮記言：『事君，事父，事師，皆當服勤致死』，是師與君父並尊，乃我國古訓。假使爲民，而不受政府之命令，則爲叛，爲子而不聽父母的束，則爲逆，爲學生而違抗；敎師之責罰，不與叛逆同類乎！</p>
<p>夫扑作敎刑，視於尙書，夏楚收威，見於禮記，即本市各學校，因學生品行惡劣，功課荒廢，而加以責罰者，亦恒有之事也，惟爲學生之家長者，溺愛子弟，毆辱敎師，致教師怨憤自殺，此則駭人聽聞之事也。</p>

<h3>"Human Resources Exchange"</h3>
<p>Currently, the European war situation is approaching the decisive stage. Militarily, both sides are exerting all their strength to strive for the final victory. At the same time, in terms of politics and diplomacy, they are also launching a final competition, each hoping it will be beneficial to their own war situation. Looking back at our East Asian war situation, although our friendly nation Japan has already laid the foundation for victory, it is expected that the enemy will not be willing to stop there, and this cannot be ignored. Therefore, how we will strengthen the defense of the Pacific in the future, and how we will contribute all our human and material resources to the completion of the war, are the common responsibilities of the participating countries.</p>
<p>It has been almost five months since China formally joined the Greater East Asia War. During this period, the National Government has taken participation in the war as a prerequisite for the establishment and implementation of various political and economic systems and policies. At the same time, Japan is also actively promoting its new policy towards China, strengthening the position of the National Government so that it can fully exert its rights and responsibilities, with the ultimate goal of strengthening the power of coordinated operations. Regarding this point, every member of the alliance on the front line of fighting the enemy and coexisting should understand it, and sincerely abide by and support the policies implemented by their respective governments.</p>
<p>However, let us reflect on whether the government has completed the preparations for the wartime system and policies in Shanghai alone. Whether the people have understood, obeyed, and supported the government's policies. We dare not give a definite answer. The mere fact that "luxury remains as before" is enough to prove that Shanghai is not like a wartime national city, and it is impossible to see that the people have the mood of wartime life. Is this phenomenon ultimately "what the superiors do, the subordinates follow"? Or is it "numbness"? We have no time to make this reckoning. We must be vigilant about the current decisive battle situation. To strive for victory and survival, we must arouse the spirit of regarding yesterday as death and today as life. From now on, we must unite from top to bottom and thoroughly practice wartime life. Especially those in power should take the lead in advocating and setting an example so that they can truly contribute all their human and material resources to the country, truly participate in coordinated operations, and truly obtain national status after victory.</p>
<p>Based on the above arguments, and considering the current actual situation, the obligations that China can fulfill by participating in the war can only extend to the economic aspect. In terms of military affairs, Japan still has to bear the arduous task alone. Therefore, we should do our best to contribute the human and material resources that we can offer in the economic aspect. Here, let us take an example of "human resources exchange" to illustrate:</p>
<p>(1) In order to enrich the materials and tools necessary for the war, it is necessary to increase production efficiency. In addition to making full use of machinery, it is also necessary to use human resources to make up for the deficiencies. This kind of human resources must have appropriate skills and experience to increase work efficiency. For example, transportation tools, such as ships, trains, and automobiles, which are most needed during wartime, are still not enough even with mass production, or the output is reduced due to insufficient steel raw materials. Therefore, wooden boats and wooden-shell vehicles must be manufactured to make up for the deficiencies, and human power must be used to supplement the insufficient mechanical power.</p>
<p>(2) In agriculture, such as the use of new agricultural tools, the improvement of seeds, and the research of cultivation techniques; in mining, such as prospecting, mining, and smelting; in industry, such as saving power and increasing output, scientific and technological guidance and promotion are needed everywhere.</p>
<p>For the above two examples, what China needs is the technical experts that Japan has, as well as the methods of scientific research crystallization; and what Japan needs is the large number of workers that China has, especially skilled workers. In this situation, under the conditions of mutual benefit, "human resources exchange" is needed between each other. China will hire Japanese technical experts to help develop the production of agriculture, mining, and industry. Japan will hire Chinese technicians to help increase the production of essential goods, and the purpose of both parties is the same: to increase wartime resources and strive for victory in the war.</p>
<p>As for the implementation of "human resources exchange", in order to ensure smooth progress and eliminate misunderstandings, the following principles should be observed:</p>
<p>(1) Absolute openness, clearly stating the skill requirements of the personnel needed and the treatment given, so that they can participate voluntarily.</p>
<p>(2) The treatment should include all living expenses of the hired personnel themselves and their families, and should be given real guarantees to ensure that they can serve with peace of mind.</p>
<p>(3) The introduction or recruitment affairs should be handled or presided over by local social justice organizations, which are purely obligatory in nature and do not take intermediary benefits.</p>
<p>In addition, from the standpoint of the Chinese, the "human resources exchange" problem, even if it is not aimed at strengthening the war effort, but only at improving the scientific and technological knowledge of the Chinese people and preparing for the future development of agriculture, industry, and the revitalization of the country, is also extremely worthy of implementation. In recent years, Japan's dedication to scientific and technological research in industry and agriculture, and its pursuit of excellence, have been praised by the world. If the Chinese people can study on the spot, in addition to increasing their skills, they can currently be contributors to the Greater East Asia War, and in the future, they can be industrial warriors to revitalize China. It is truly a win-win situation. At the same time, we can hire Japanese experts to come to China to provide scientific and technological guidance, and its goal is the same as those who go abroad to work. Benefiting oneself and others, why not do it!</p>
<h3>The Russo-Japanese War - A Record from This Newspaper Thirty-Eight Years Ago - Old Newspaper Re-transcribed (9)</h3>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>We recognize that defending the Pacific in the future will be the responsibility of all Asians, and that British and American interference and aggression will no longer be allowed. However, completing the task of defense depends on a strong naval force. Our friendly nation Japan has established a navy through decades of hard work and continuous improvement. In the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago, it showed its strength by defeating the many with the few. In the current Greater East Asia War, it has demonstrated its invincible power. Currently, the entire defense of the Pacific is the sole responsibility of the friendly navy, and we are deeply ashamed that we have not been able to share the burden. Therefore, how we will take the friendly navy as a model, establish a new Chinese navy, and participate in the task of defending the Pacific is a goal that the Chinese people should strive to achieve together. In order to increase the Chinese people's naval knowledge and interest, this newspaper will re-transcribe the records of the Russo-Japanese War from thirty-eight years ago, from the 21st to the 30th, for a period of ten days. Readers are kindly requested to pay attention.</p>
<h3>Documents on the Surrender of Russian Troops and the Acceptance of Surrender by Japanese Troops (Published in This Newspaper No. 11401, the Fifth Day of the Twelfth Lunar Month of the 30th Year of Guangxu, January 10, 1905 in the Western Calendar, Tuesday)</h3>
<p>This newspaper has repeatedly reported on the surrender of the Russian army in Lushun to the Japanese. Now, a friend residing in Tokyo, Japan, has sent a letter saying: On the night of the first day of the first month of Meiji 38, a certain commander of the Lushun political group sent a telegram to the headquarters, mainly stating that at 5 p.m. on this day, a certain Russian military officer submitted a document to a certain commander of the first battalion of our army south of the Shuishiying, and at 9 p.m., it was forwarded to the commander Nogi Maresuke, roughly stating that Your Excellency is well aware of everything that has happened in the area of conflict. Our commander anticipates that further contention with your army in Lushunkou will only damage our military prestige and will be of no benefit. Therefore, we are willing to open our gates and arrange a date for surrender. We believe that Your Excellency shares this view. The specific details of the surrender should be negotiated by designated personnel from our side and personnel sent by your side at a selected location. The situation has reached this point, and there is no other choice. Respectfully submitted, with best regards, from Russian Lieutenant General Stössel to Baron Nogi, Commander of the Besieging Army. The following day, at dawn, Japanese commander Nogi wrote a reply, stating: January 2, 1905, Lushunkou Besieging Army Headquarters, Nogi Maresuke, replies to General Stössel, stating that I agree with Your Excellency on the matter of the surrender of your army and the mutual negotiation of all procedures, and I also feel honored. I am now sending the Chief of Staff of the Lushunkou Besieging Army, Ijichi Kosuke. Please follow the instructions and bring several staff members and attendants to meet with the personnel sent by your army at Shuishiying at noon on January 2, 1905, to negotiate the procedures. The seal will serve as proof of good faith, submitted for approval, and granted full authority to jointly discuss this matter. Respectfully replied, with best regards. This to His Excellency General Stössel, Commander of the Kwantung Fortress.</p>
<h3>Famous General Tan Xin (Published in This Newspaper No. 11398, the Second Day of the Twelfth Lunar Month of the 30th Year of Guangxu, January 7, 1905 in the Western Calendar, Saturday)</h3>
<p>Yesterday at noon, this newspaper received a special telegram from a friend in Tokyo, Japan, stating: At 9 a.m. on the 30th day of the 11th lunar month, Nogi Maresuke, the commander of the Japanese Lushun Army, met with Stössel, the surrendered Russian general, at Shuishiying (the place name is not a naval base). Stössel praised the Japanese army for its精悍bravery and courage, and admired General Nogi's extraordinary wisdom and courage, expressing his utmost respect. He also thanked Nogi for forwarding a telegram to the Russian Emperor and for the Japanese Emperor's generous treatment of the surrendered soldiers. Nogi Maresuke recounted that his son Kazuhito was a lieutenant and his son Ishi was a second lieutenant in the army, and both had sacrificed their lives for the country. Stössel could not stop shedding tears, saying: "This is also the glory of parents. General, your reputation is truly world-renowned." After the conversation, Nogi Maresuke invited Stössel and the Japanese and Russian counselors to have lunch at the same table. After the meal, Stössel presented his Arabian horse as a gift, but Nogi Maresuke smiled and declined, saying: "This is also part of the military strength, and I dare not accept it." Stössel insisted, so Nogi accepted it in the name of the army, stating that he would take good care of it in the future and treat the horse as if he were seeing an old friend. At one quarter past one in the afternoon, Stössel bid farewell and returned.</p>
<h3>A Translated Compilation of Victorious Telegrams from the Japanese Navy (Published in This Newspaper No. 11536, the 28th Day of the Fourth Lunar Month of the 31st Year of Guangxu, May 31, 1905 in the Western Calendar, Wednesday)</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Daily reported from Tokyo on the 26th that six Russian battleships and five warships were sunk by the Japanese army. Two more battleships, two cruisers, and two other warships were seized. Russian Third Fleet Commander Vice Admiral Nebogatov was also captured by the Japanese army. Another telegram stated that the Russian ships sunk by the Japanese army included two battleships, seven cruisers, one armored cruiser, and three torpedo boats. In addition to Admiral Nebogatov, the Japanese army captured 2,000 prisoners. Another telegram from London stated that the British Political Department received a telegram from the Japanese government stating that the Japanese navy had engaged the Russian army in the Korea Strait and had confined the Russian fleet within the strait. Another telegram from Washington stated that two Russian battleships, three cruisers, and one repair ship were sunk by the Japanese army. Another telegram from Shanghai stated that the Japanese government issued Admiral Togo's communiqué today, as follows: On the morning of the 24th, the Russian fleet was encountered at Tsushima Island. Both sides fought fiercely until the afternoon. At night, the Japanese army also used torpedo boats to attack, which was very effective. Yesterday, the Japanese army continued to fight and drove the Russian ships towards Korea. Two Russian battleships surrendered, and one cruiser was escorted away. The Japanese navy suffered significant damage. According to the prisoners, two Russian battleships, one cruiser, and three other warships were sunk by the Japanese army on the 24th. The Japanese army captured 2,000 Russian prisoners, including Admiral Nebogatov. According to other sources, a total of thirteen Russian ships were sunk and six were seized. It is not known whether the three ships sunk as reported by the prisoners are included in this number. The above prisoners said that there were also 1,000 soldiers captured by the Japanese army. Another telegram from Tokyo stated that the news of the Japanese navy's victory this afternoon shocked everyone. They were also happy to hear that Japan suffered very little damage. This was an unexpected victory and a special blessing from heaven. The speed of the Japanese ships was superior to that of the Russian ships, and the starlight at night helped the torpedo boats to attack. This morning, the Japanese army continued to pursue the Russian ships. The Russian prisoners captured by the Japanese have landed in Incheon, and some have landed in other parts of Japan in batches. It is said that when the Russian ships approached Vladivostok, they feared that the entire army would be annihilated by the Japanese. The Russian ships participating in this battle numbered 26. Tonight, the price of Japanese national bonds rose sharply, so sales were temporarily suspended. The Times reported from Tokyo on the 25th that it was heard that several thousand people had died in the Russo-Japanese naval battle, and neither side was willing to give in. A telegram from Tokyo on the 26th stated that the government announced that Admiral Togo had destroyed the Russian fleet. Another telegram stated that 19 Russian ships, including battleships, coastal defense ships (i.e., old-style warships), and cruisers, were sunk or captured by Admiral Togo. Another telegram stated that Admiral Togo sank two Russian battleships, two coastal defense ships, and five cruisers. Another telegram stated that the Japanese army seized two battleships, two coastal defense ships, one special transport ship, and one torpedo boat. Another telegram stated that Admiral Togo reported that the Japanese fleet suffered significant damage. Another telegram stated that the Russian Vice Admiral, the commander of the Third Baltic Fleet, and 3,000 sailors surrendered to the Japanese army. Another telegram stated that the Russian fleet was able to enter the Japanese navy's battle line, but was driven away by Togo, so the second half of the battle was a fierce pursuit. Another telegram stated that the Japanese navy department had announced that all seas west of Japan are now navigable and there is no danger, which suggests that the main force of the Russian navy has been annihilated.</p>
<p>A telegram from London on the 27th stated that two Russian battleships, two armored cruisers, four second-class cruisers, and two repair ships were sunk by the Japanese army. Three battleships and two cruisers were also seized. The Russian admiral's flagship was severely damaged. Five torpedo boats were also sunk by the Japanese army, and one torpedo boat was seized. The two armies fought for two consecutive days (i.e., the 24th and 25th). No Japanese ships were damaged. The Russian admiral seemed to have escaped, and the Japanese army was still pursuing. Vice Admiral Nebogatov and 3,000 sailors were captured by the Japanese army. Another telegram stated that the price of Japanese national bonds rose sharply, and overall market conditions were better than before. Another telegram stated that when the news of Japan's great victory reached London, the British were very satisfied, saying that the hope of a peace settlement was better than before.</p>

<h3>Japanese Ambassador Tani Masayuki Talks in Peking - Japan's Fundamental Policy Towards China - Assisting the National Government to Strengthen Thorough Cooperation with China - The Issue of Transferring Taxation Rights is in Active Progress</h3>
<p>Peking, 28th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Tani Masayuki, met with a group of Chinese and foreign reporters here at 5 p.m. on the 28th to explain Japan's fundamental policy towards China, which is centered on assisting the National Government to strengthen its power and thoroughly cooperate with China's national affairs. He also stated that Japan will return taxation rights to China following the recent return of concessions. He said that North China has very close relations with Japan and Manchuria in terms of Chinese national affairs, economy, and geography, and its position is also extremely important. After China's participation in the war, the Japanese government still takes mutual concession between China and Japan as its stance, and deeply knows that it must deeply practice living and dying together to be effective. Therefore, the Japanese government is also actively implementing policies based on morality. It has already implemented the return of concessions, and the issue of transferring taxation rights is also in active progress. In order to implement it as soon as possible, things must be carefully considered in advance. Japan's past diplomacy towards China took the Republic of China as the stage, but in fact, it targeted Britain and the United States. After the Greater East Asia War, the influence of Britain and the United States has been thoroughly cleared, restoring the original position of Japan and China, and efforts can be made to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. If Japan can continue to assist China in both material and spiritual aspects with moral diplomacy, it is certain that the Chinese people will understand the true meaning of the foundation and complete the goal of mutual cooperation.</p>
<p>Peking, 28th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Tani Masayuki, came to Peking on the 27th to inspect the actual situation in various parts of North China after taking office. At 9 a.m. on the 28th, he went to the Shrine and the Rei-Ansho of the Nishi Hongwanji Temple to pay homage. At 9:50 a.m., he summoned and instructed the ambassadors, consuls, and all staff, and listened to the reports of the heads of various departments on the current situation. At 12:00 p.m., he visited Mr. Okamura, the Supreme Commander of the North China Army, for discussions. He also visited Chairman Zhu of the North China Political Affairs Committee. At 1:00 p.m., Chairman Zhu hosted a banquet at the Political Affairs Committee to entertain Ambassador Tani. After the meeting, he continued to visit the Japanese Embassy, the Naval Attaché's Office, the Manchurian Embassy, and the embassies of Germany, Italy, and France. At 5:00 p.m., he met with Chinese and Japanese reporters at the hotel. That evening, he hosted a banquet to entertain important figures from all walks of life in China, Japan, Manchuria, Germany, and Italy. The guests and hosts were extremely happy, and the banquet did not end until about 9:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Air Force Fiercely Attacks Qianniuling - The Japanese Army in Yichang Launches the Battle to Exit the Mountain</h3>
<p>Hankow, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from a certain frontline base of the Japanese army in Central China, after the elite troops of the Japanese infantry began to attack the three divisions of the Chongqing River Defense Army stationed southwest of Yichang on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, they have now completely surrounded them. The Japanese air force also cooperated with the ground troops and bombed the Chongqing army, which was stubbornly resisting by holding Qianniuling (20 kilometers west of Yichang), on the 28th, and used machine guns to sweep them, causing them to fall into chaos. At the same time, they also attacked the Chongqing army that was trying to escape the encirclement, making their attempts futile. At that time, a large formation of the Chongqing army was found gathering near Zhoujiakou Muqiaoxi, 15 kilometers northwest of Changyang. They were immediately bombed to annihilation.</p>
<p>Hankow, 28th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese army surrounded the 30,000 soldiers of the three divisions of the Chongqing River Defense Army, who were relying on the steep mountains of the Bashan Mountains, and captured Yutaishan and Luojiaba, two key points near Yichang, they completed the posture of controlling the Yichang Gorge. The Japanese army is still engaged in mountain warfare in various places, and the posture of attacking the interior of Chongqing is also ready. Originally, the Japanese army was preparing to attack Changde, the base of the Sixth War Zone of Chongqing, but it suddenly turned to attack the front of Yichang, exerting the power of mechanized unit operations. This was unexpected by the Chongqing army. The Japanese army immediately eliminated the resistance of the Chongqing army and advanced forward. The only natural and steep passes that the Chongqing army relied on had no effect in the face of the Japanese army's fierce attack. The people in the Mou area have been able to live and work in peace since the arrival of the Japanese army, which has a profound impact on the people under the rule of Chongqing. In order to reverse the decline, Chongqing dispatched aircraft to assist in the battle, but in the end, it failed to stop the Japanese army. In an instant, the Japanese army seized the important defense line connecting Changyang, Yuyangguan, Yutaishan, and Yichang Gorge and secured it. The Japanese army is now preparing to launch a fierce attack on the heart of Chongqing.</p>
<p>Hankow, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from a certain area of the Japanese army in the Yangtze River Basin, since the Japanese army launched a summer offensive against the "Sixth War Zone" of Chongqing in the Yichang area, it has dealt a major blow to the Chongqing army. The Japanese naval forces also intercepted many British and American ships in the upper reaches of Yichang and then returned to defense leisurely. Chongqing was very embarrassed by this. The enemy ships intercepted this time included Chihe, Shashi, Xianghua and other ships, as well as small oil tanker barges, passenger ships, tugboats, small steamers, and floating docks, totaling 52 ships.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army in China's Weekly War Situation</h3>
<p>Nanking, 28th (Central News Agency) The Japanese Expeditionary Army in China issued a weekly war situation report on the 28th, stating: After the Japanese army determined the so-called "Hunan Grain Area on the North Bank of Dongting Lake," the elite troops of the land and air forces urgently pursued the remnants of the enemy in order to completely annihilate them, and at the same time launched new actions. Yuyangguan, according to the local area, is the first gateway of the Sixth War Zone of Chongqing and an important supply base. It has completely occupied Changyang, the stronghold of the 86th Division of Chongqing. The war is continuing to expand. Recently, the internal combat power of the Chongqing army has been so low that it cannot be recovered. It can be seen from this operation that there is no quick connection between the Chongqing armies. Under the fierce attack of the Japanese elite troops, they collapse everywhere and at any time. This proves that the Chongqing army's combat power is declining and the anti-war atmosphere among the soldiers is strong. In this operation, Zou Pingfan's army of the National Government has always cooperated and defeated the stubborn enemy. At noon on the 22nd, it completely occupied Yidu, the stronghold of the 185th Division of Chongqing. In North China, 1,500 members of Yang Youbo's troops were completely disarmed. General Wu Huawen's elite troops of the Shandong Army of the National Government and other returning troops all participated and actively played a role in crushing the Chongqing army's operations, achieving great results. The Taihang Mountain operation in North China this spring has completely annihilated the communist army in the area south of the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway, achieving great results. It was ended on the 20th of this month. The army aviation unit has closely cooperated with the ground troops in various places for many days, and has bombed Hengyang twice and raided the Chongqing military facilities in Jianou.</p>

<h3>The Restoration of the Yuyao Salt Field</h3>
<p>The Yuyao Purge Work has made significant progress. The procurement agencies for Yuyao salt have also been unified, thus sealing off the smuggling routes to Chongqing. Since the start of the Purge Work, the salt extraction policy and the work to stabilize people's livelihoods have been actively promoted, so the salt administration has been unified to achieve the goal. Recently, the Guohua Salt Industry Company took over the business agencies of the former Dacheng Salt Industry Company (Ningbo, Yuyao, Jinhua, Cixi) and will set up sales offices in Xiaoshan and Shaoxing. In addition, decisions have been made on the purchase price, storage methods, and removal methods. For the sake of benefiting the salt workers, it has been decided to increase the purchase price. The original price was eight yuan, but it will be doubled in the future (i.e., sixteen yuan per dan). The salt workers and Baozhang will transfer it to the Zhejiang East Salt Affairs Administration, and then the storage price will be determined. The total production in the area is 3 million dan, which is sufficient for the needs of the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. Yuyao was originally one of the three major salt fields in China. (May 28, Dalu News)</p>

<h3>Intense Land and Air Battles Resume in the Small Strip of Land on the Eastern Wing of the Kuban. The German Army Repels a Large-Scale Soviet Offensive. Fierce Fighting Also Occurs on the Central and Northern Fronts.</h3>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 28th (Central News Agency) – After a quiet spring on the Eastern Front, the first major battle occurred yesterday in the Kuban River area. At that time, more than ten Soviet divisions, covered by aircraft and tanks, launched a major offensive against the German troops near Krymskaya. According to the German war report, the Red Army's offensive was resisted after fierce fighting. The tactics used in this battle were similar to those used in the last World War, with the German troops holding their positions in trenches and the Red Army bombarding them with artillery before attacking. The German troops then retreated to their rear positions, the first line of which was only defended by machine guns and</p>
<p>artillery. As the Soviet infantry rushed in, they fell into this network of fire. Although the German side stated that this offensive had been broken, the Red Army still had the appearance of repeating, and the German war report did not mention the number of Red Army casualties, indicating that the battle was still ongoing. There were no battles in other areas, and both sides were still actively arranging their positions.</p>

<h3>Japanese Government Decides to Request Convening of Extraordinary Diet; Session to Begin on June 15th and Last Three Days</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 0:30 PM on the 28th that the Japanese government held a cabinet meeting on the 28th and decided to request the convening of an extraordinary session of the Diet. The session will begin on June 15th and last for three days. The purpose is to request support for special urgent budget proposals and legal bills related to the current situation. At the same time, the government will take this opportunity to clarify its belief in promoting national policy at home and abroad. The cases scheduled to be submitted are as follows: (1) Budget proposals: A. Proposal to increase the purchase price of rice; B. Proposal for emergency food production increase; C. Proposal for enterprise consolidation. (2) Legal bills: A. Bond Act related to the budget proposal; B. Special Accounting Act related to the budget proposal; C. Revised National Regeneration Fund Act; D. Legal bill on enterprise consolidation funding measures. For the cases submitted to the extraordinary Diet, it was decided to consolidate the outline of enterprise consolidation on June 4th and consolidate the budget proposal and legal bills on June 11th.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) – Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, in order to establish a decisive situation internally and externally, the Japanese government has urgently sought to promote the domestic situation centered on the five major ultra-priority industries, and externally promote cooperative relations with China, Manchukuo, and Thailand, and promote the construction of Myanmar, the Philippines, and other military and political regions within the Co-Prosperity Sphere. All these measures have been successful in the past. In order to achieve a rapid increase in war materials, it has decided to strengthen the domestic production mechanism and provide emergency consolidation to various enterprises. Regarding these points to be consolidated, the Planning Board has previously formulated relevant legal bills and budget proposals, separately by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Ministry of Finance, and other relevant ministries. Now they are largely completed. In order to request the support of the Japanese Diet, it has been decided to convene an extraordinary session of the Diet on June 13th, with a three-day agenda, to review the cases. The characteristics of this extraordinary Diet can be roughly divided into two. First, in order to smoothly promote the eight major national plans for the 18th year of Showa that were previously decided (especially to ensure the increased production of iron, coal, aircraft, ships, and light metals, the five major ultra-priority industries), the enterprise facilities that are not particularly related to the enhancement of combat capabilities will be shifted to these priority industries in order to form a broad decisive production mechanism. Second, in order to ensure the main food supply for the nation during wartime, on the other hand, the government will take this opportunity to declare its belief in national policy at home and abroad. Therefore, the Prime Minister Tojo's speech at that time is worth noting. This extraordinary Diet, in form, is to submit the legal bills for consolidating the domestic system to the Diet for deliberation, but the government's major statements on domestic and foreign policies are indeed worthy of expectation.</p>
<h3>Rear Admiral Sanbei Sadamitsu Publishes History of Japanese Aircraft Carrier Development</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) – Former Commander of the Naval Air Force, Rear Admiral Sadamitsu Sanbei, published an article on Naval Memorial Day on the 27th entitled "History of Japanese Aircraft Carrier Development." The historical process is worth referring to. The following is a record:</p>
<p>"Converting Merchant Ships into Aircraft Carriers" - The creation of new aircraft carriers was only 30 years ago, in Taisho 2 (1913). At that time, in order to further utilize the reconnaissance power of aircraft for naval combat, it was started to convert merchant ships to carry aircraft, which was the initial stage of the creation of aircraft carriers. Various naval powers in the world began to study aircraft carriers at this time. Japan also first converted the merchant ship "Wakamiya" into a seaplane carrier in Taisho 2 to carry Curtiss and Farman seaplane reconnaissance aircraft. The ship participated in the Qingdao battle in the following year and exerted its power. At that time, the total number of aircraft was only twelve, and the number of crew members was only fifteen. Comparing this with the strength of the Japanese naval air force today, there is a great sense of difference between the past and the present.</p>
<p>"Research on Carrying Land-Based Aircraft" - Research on aircraft has made great progress after World War I. It is not only used for reconnaissance, but also shows its unique power in attack. Therefore, the idea of ​​carrying fast and powerful land-based aircraft on ships so that they can take off and land anytime and anywhere in the ocean has attracted the attention of various countries. Based on this requirement, Japan also began to further study seaplane carriers. In December of Taisho 8, construction of the "Hosho" was started, and it was completed in December of Taisho 11. However, because the ship's tonnage was only 9,500 tons, its speed was only 25 knots, and the ship was only 55 meters long and 15 meters wide, it was quite difficult for aircraft to take off and land on this deck. After two years of various experiments and careful training and guidance of operators, it was incorporated into the fleet in Taisho 13. At this point, the Japanese Navy officially had an aircraft carrier (converting battleships into aircraft carriers). The construction of the "Akagi" and "Kaga" began in December of Taisho 9, and their conversion into aircraft carriers was in March of Showa 2, which took five years and four months to complete. The reason why the cruiser "Kaga" and the battleship "Akagi" were quickly converted into aircraft carriers was because the main battleships were restricted as a result of the arms reduction conference and had to be abandoned. At that time, countries were secretly researching the construction of aircraft carriers and carefully studied them. Therefore, the conversion of the "Akagi" and "Kaga" was repeatedly improved and redesigned based on the actual combat experience of the "Hosho," so it took a long time. The two aircraft carriers were incorporated into the fleet in Showa 3. Since then, the Japanese Navy has also been able to use aircraft for combat and conduct formal training.</p>
<p>"Unique Tactics of Japanese Aircraft Carriers" - The 5:5:3 ratio of the arms reduction conference also applied to aircraft carriers. Therefore, the British and American aircraft carriers had 135,000 tons, and Japan had 81,000 tons. Within this limit, new aircraft carriers were built and divided into two types: large and small. Large ones had fewer ships, and small ones had more ships. As a result, the United States adopted the large aircraft carrier form of 20,000 tons, and Japan adopted the small Soryu-type form of 10,000 tons in order to use this to confront the United States. From then on, the "Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday" of aviation began. The technical director of the Aviation Headquarters at that time was the late Admiral Yamamoto. The department also worked hard to improve the handling technology of aircraft carriers and aircraft, and the manufacturing technology of carrier-based aircraft under the command of Admiral Yamamoto. Before the start of this war, our technology and training can be said to have reached the highest level.</p>
<p>"Anecdote About Abolishing Aircraft Carriers" - During the London arms reduction conference, there was once a proposal to abolish aircraft carriers. However, the United States was the first to object. Its intention was nothing more than to allow its aircraft carriers, which were superior to Japan's, to go far into the Pacific Ocean to engage in offensive operations, but they did not expect that they would be wiped out by the Japanese aircraft carriers in one fell swoop.</p>
<h3>Washington Conference Concludes; Churchill Will Issue Detailed Report After Returning Home; Davies Carries Stalin's Long Letter Back to the United States</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to Washington sources, the White House issued a communique regarding the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting, stating only that complete agreement had been reached. Therefore, those in the Allied camp who had hoped to glean the future course of Allied operations from the announcement were disappointed. The White House announcement said only: "The joint chiefs of staff meeting recently held in Washington has ended, and complete agreement has been reached on future operations on all fronts." President Roosevelt's secretary, O'Reilly, told the press last night at the White House after reading the communique: "I can only tell you this much." According to Reuters, President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill had originally planned to jointly issue a statement, but later decided to issue the brief announcement in Roosevelt's name. It is not known whether Churchill had seen the announcement before it was released. O'Reilly said: The Allied leaders decided on this new approach at the last minute yesterday.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 28th (Haitong News Agency) – Well-informed political figures in London said yesterday that after returning home from Washington, British Prime Minister Churchill will issue a detailed account of the Washington talks. The British House of Commons will then hold a three-day debate.</p>
<p>Moscow, 28th (Central News Agency) – Stalin handed a long letter to Roosevelt, written in Russian, to Ambassador Davies on the night of the 26th. Davies then departed from Moscow and headed back to Washington with the letter.</p>
<h3>Admiral Yamamoto, Though Dead, Still Lives</h3>
<p>— Tokutomi Iichiro</p>
<p>When a general star falls from the sky, everyone in the world is shocked. If you say it's an accident, then it's a real accident. Since the issuance of the declaration of war against Britain and the United States on December 8th of Showa 16, Commander-in-Chief Yamamoto of the Combined Fleet has been the most meritorious among the heroes of the Japanese army, navy, and air force. Since the world-shocking attack on Pearl Harbor, his operations have become more and more brilliant, and his great achievements are unparalleled in the history of naval warfare in the world, ancient and modern. Relying on the heavenly power of His Majesty the Emperor and the loyalty and bravery of the soldiers, the leader was Yamamoto Isoroku himself. Even if you say that Yamamoto Isoroku is the number one hero in the Greater East Asia War, it is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Now he has unfortunately died in battle. However, his death in battle is neither Zhuge Kongming's Autumn Wind Wuzhangyuan, nor Kusunoki Masashige's Minatogawa. If you want to find an example, Nelson's death in the Battle of Trafalgar is comparable. That is to gain victory with death. Moreover, he not only gained victory, but we believe that Yamamoto Isoroku will forever be a great military god of Japan, taking on the new task of comprehensively guarding the prestige of the Japanese nation in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Commander Yamamoto was full of fighting spirit, courageous, full of pearls, resourceful, and consistently upheld the Japanese spirit. His ancestor Yamakawa took a sword in the army of Kitaetsu and fought hard with the help of Kawai Tsugunosuke. Although his sword was broken and his ammunition was exhausted, he finally remained unyielding and died calmly. Compared with his ancestor, Yamamoto Isoroku's death is a thousand times more glorious and also an effective death. His death can be said to be dying in the right place.</p>
<p>In the Japanese Navy, there are many talented people. With the loss of one Yamamoto Isoroku, there are many more Yamamoto Isoroku. We will never suffer because there is no successor. In the life of all mankind, no one has accomplished such great feats in such a short time as Yamamoto. From this point of view, he can also close his eyes in peace in the underworld. He left the stage of the real world to others, and he himself became a hero in the ghost world, a military god. For the sake of Japan, he is the guardian god in the Pacific Ocean—including the Indian Ocean. He was given special grace, listed in the Marshal's Mansion, awarded the First Class Golden Kite Medal, and given a state funeral. His posthumous glory can be described as the utmost. If some of us are disappointed and frustrated by his death, it is definitely not the attitude we should have to comfort his heroic spirit. If we want to express our sincere condolences to him, we should ignite the spirit of battle even more fiercely and move forward on the road to defeating Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Yamamoto Isoroku is dead. But his death is the death of a man. If he is a military god, he is still alive. He lives like Kusunoki Masashige, like Marshal Togo. His spirit will never be buried in the sea. Under the new commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet, we will see the unfolding of a new situation. (Sho: Eki 5, Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Sea Battle of Japan and Pacific Naval Warfare</h3>
<p>— Kento Tominaga</p>
<p>(4) Lessons for Modern Naval Warfare Tactics</p>
<p>The Sea Battle of Japan was the first modern naval battle, and its influence on modern naval warfare was extremely significant.</p>
<p>Modern warfare absolutely requires the support of the entire nation and tends towards total war. It can be said that the Russo-Japanese War initiated this.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Russo-Japanese War proved that the Japanese Navy was a decisive factor in maintaining peace in the Far East.</p>
<p>In terms of armaments and weaponry, the success or failure of a naval battle is determined by the size of the forces participating in the decisive battle, which was also proven in this war. This became a strong foundation for the later 5:5:3 ratio. In other words, whether or not an attack can be launched does not depend on the distance between the two countries, but rather on the size of the possessions. The length of the coastline and the breadth of the security area are not the basis for determining the size of the possessions. A nation's holdings are equal to its decisive battle force.</p>
<p>Furthermore, due to this astonishing victory, the single-minded focus on giant guns became fashionable among the naval powers after the war, further stimulating the tendency to engage in decisive battles with main guns, resulting in the era of the "Dreadnought" class battleships. The structure of the ships also changed accordingly, with emphasis on defense and increased bullet resistance. At the same time, shells were improved, and the range of artillery battles was extended to counter them, resulting in a major change in naval warfare tactics.</p>
<p>(5) The Sea Battle of Japan and the Greater East Asia Naval Warfare</p>
<p>Comparing the Sea Battle of Japan thirty-eight years ago with the current Greater East Asia Naval Warfare, it is extremely difficult to compare them in terms of scale and size of the battlefield, the degree of advancement of weapons, especially the active role of new weapons, and the changes in tactics. There are differences, and also many common points and similarities.</p>
<p>The vastness of the battlefield is one of the characteristics of naval warfare. In the case of the Sea Battle of Japan, the battlefield can be said to be almost limited to the Sea of Japan.</p>
<p>The enemy's Pacific Fleet, with Vladivostok or Port Arthur as its base, was only used to threaten the transport of troops. Even if they moved to the Pacific, they only cruised around the east coast of Japan. Although there was reinforcement from the Baltic Fleet, its purpose was only to merge with the remaining fleet in Vladivostok, so its operational range never exceeded the Sea of Japan.</p>
<p>However, this time the operational sea extends from Hawaii in the east, and the American continents, to the east coast, south to Madagascar Island, and north to the Aleutian Islands. Moreover, the Pacific and Indian Oceans, more than half of the earth's sea surface, have become battlefields. From the point of view of the extent, there is a real difference like heaven and earth.</p>
<p>The degree of difference in the advancement of weapons is also incomparable. First, take the increase in ship type as an example: the flagship Mikasa was already considered the strongest and largest warship in the Japanese Navy at the time, but its displacement was only 15,200 tons, and its main gun was 12 inches. The current 35,000-ton capital ships carry 16-inch guns on the bow and stern lines, which is like a pygmy seeing a giant when compared to the past. The increase in range and the improvement of gunpowder also represent significant progress.</p>
<p>The development of shipbuilding and armament technology, as well as popular weapons such as torpedoes and electric machinery, has resulted in extraordinary progress in defensive and offensive capabilities.</p>
<p>The most significant change is the development of new weapons, especially aircraft and submarines, and the resulting three-dimensionalization of tactics.</p>
<p>As a result, naval warfare tactics have undergone a fundamental transformation. The naval battles in the Russo-Japanese War, after the two naval battles of the Meiji 37th year—the Yellow Sea Battle and the Battle of Ulsan—were fought in one battle in Japan. In this war, starting with the naval battles of Hawaii and Malaysia at the beginning of the war, through more than a dozen large and small decisive naval battles, the total tonnage sunk has already tripled that of the Baltic Fleet. Although the US Navy has suffered such losses, it cannot be said that it is still intact, but it has not yet been subdued.</p>
<p>At least before World War I, naval vessels, as the main weapons, were not only extremely valuable, but their construction and replenishment also required a lot of materials and time. Once defeated in a decisive battle involving the concentration of all forces, it would be difficult to recover the strength in the shortest period of time. On the contrary, the emergence of air power, which can be replenished in large quantities in a short period of time, has endowed the content of naval decisive battles with the character of an astonishing supply battle, enabling continuous decisive battles.</p>
<p>The Russo-Japanese Naval Battle elevated the entire possession of military strength to the position of decisive battle strength. Now, the possession of military strength is naturally still necessary, but in the near future, the possession of military strength must also be considered as decisive battle strength. That limit is the national power of all departments.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, it is now impossible to lie dormant in heavily guarded ports as fortress fleets or standby fleets to preserve their strength, as was possible in the past—for example, the Port Arthur Fleet.</p>
<p>That is the characteristic of modern naval warfare that seeks to resolve the difficulty of forced decisive battles by air attacks, and at the same time, it can be said to be the contradiction of a quick battle and a quick decision.</p>
<p>So, will the Sea Battle of Japan, which decisively determined Japan's fate in one fell swoop, not be seen in the Pacific Naval Warfare? (翔: From "Modern" May)</p>

<h3>Actual Transactions in North and Central China are Settled in Three Ways</h3>
<p>(1) Reserve Note Exchange (2) Special Yen Exchange and (3) Imports and Exports Without Exchange</p>
<p>According to sources, actual transactions between North and Central China will be implemented as soon as the authorities' consultations are completed. The settlement of transactions is divided into three types: Reserve Note Exchange, Special Yen Exchange, and No Exchange. (1) Reserve Note Exchange (presumably 18 Federal Reserve Notes equal 100 Reserve Notes). The export items from North China are coal, asbestos, iron, salt, alkali, lime, gypsum, walnuts, charcoal, anhydrous sesame, sodium nitrate, sodium sulfide, and glass plates. The import items are wheat, sulfurized river ammonia, gauze, etc. (2) Special Yen Exchange. The export items include (A) exports exchanged for reserve notes, (B) iron sulfide ore, heavy nitrate, refractory bricks, refractory mortar, pottery, various rubber products, peanuts, raw oil, sesame, kidney beans, soybeans, eggs, salt, and dried fish. (C) Soap, raw lacquer, and other commodities deemed not directly related to export. The import items are soybean cake, thin paper, sugar, cloth rolls, flannel, silk, cotton cloth machines, mechanical equipment parts, alum, zinc oxide, dyes, paints, industrial chemicals, buffalo hides, printing ink, cloth products, silk fabrics, rayon fabrics, plush, wool fabrics, tea, stationery, automobiles, and spare parts. (3) The export items without exchange are the same as those for special yen exchange. The import items include (A) imports exchanged for reserve notes. (B) From soybean cake to printing ink in the imports exchanged for special yen. (C) Luxury goods and other items unsuitable for import.</p>
<h3>Newly Revised Timetable for the Two Routes in Southern Sichuan</h3>
<p>The management offices of the Upper Sichuan and Upper Southern routes, together with the Shanghai Special Municipality Ferry Company, have revised the old timetable to facilitate passengers and facilitate connections. It is reported that it will be implemented from June 1st. At the same time, the management offices of the two routes have also moved up and delayed the morning and evening departures on the Upper Southern route due to the summer season and longer days, in order to provide passengers with full convenience. The implementation date is also set to begin on June 1st. The departing trips from Qingningsi are three times a day: 9:45 am, 2:00 pm, and 6:20 pm. The departing trips from Jiangzhen are three times a day: 7:00 am, 11:55 am, and 4:05 pm.</p>

<p>Fare and Passenger Limit for Rowing Boats</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Utility Bureau has recently observed that rowing boats and sampans carrying passengers to and from various docks on the Huangpu River often do not comply with regulations regarding fares and the number of passengers, which has been criticized by travelers, especially at the Qingningsi to Guangxin Road dock. Because the last train on the Upper Sichuan Railway arrives at Qingningsi Station when the last ferry has already departed, passengers have to take sampans or rowing boats across the river. Generally, cunning boatmen take advantage of this opportunity to demand exorbitant fares and disregard passenger safety by carrying more passengers than allowed. It is deemed necessary to take action to address this issue. Therefore, it is hereby announced that the fare for sampans and rowing boats between Guangxin Pier and Qingningsi is two yuan per person, and the number of passengers shall not exceed five for sampans and eight for rowing boats. Water inspectors will be dispatched to Qingningsi and various docks at any time to inspect, manage, and ensure safety.</p>
<h3>Central China Tobacco Distribution, Sixth Phase Begins Picking Up Goods, Eliminate Black Market and Prevent Resale, Yellow Plum Season Approaching Affects Stockpiling</h3>
<p>The Central China Tobacco Distribution Association, in order to fully distribute cigarettes to meet legitimate needs, stipulates that goods will be dispatched three times a month, on the 5th, 15th, and 25th, according to A, B, C, and D cargo cards, using a 1-2-4-8 system for dispatching goods. The goods dispatched are limited to wholesale and retail merchants, who must sell them equally in ten days, and hoarding and refusal to sell are absolutely prohibited. Recently, the sixth phase of cargo dispatch has notified wholesale and retail merchants to pay and pick up goods. Most of the cigarettes are from the military-managed Gu Zhong Company and the Japanese-owned China Tobacco Company. It is stipulated that the value of D cargo cards is 3,000 yuan, and the values of C, B, and A increase proportionally. In recent days, due to full distribution and the upcoming yellow plum season, as well as the successive dispatch of goods in various parts of Central China, reselling is no longer profitable. Households are afraid of mold and dare not hoard too much, resulting in a sharp drop in black market prices, and few entrants. The market is trending towards oversupply. Therefore, the black market price is almost the same as the limited price. It is easier for general buyers to buy limited-price cigarettes than before. However, the trend of queuing up for cigarettes has not been curbed. As for (1) retail merchants applying for upgrades, and (2) new tobacco merchants applying for registration and distribution, the association has dispatched personnel to investigate separately. Once approved, they will be processed. It is also reported that the deadline for new tobacco firms requesting cargo distribution is May 1st, and new requests have been temporarily closed.</p>
<h3>The Newspaper Prepares for Next Term Scholarship</h3>
<p>The newspaper's scholarship has been supported by donations from all walks of life in the past, enabling poor students to have the opportunity to continue their studies, which has greatly enhanced the glory of education in Shanghai. Now that the summer vacation is approaching, the scholarship matters for the next semester should be prepared in advance. We are grateful for the daily assistance from all parties, but the tuition fees for the next semester, in terms of the current standard of living, are very different from the past, and a large amount of money will be needed. We dare to ask enthusiastic people in the community to think of the situation of these diligent young people, generously donate, so that they can barely overcome the difficulties, which is also the blessing of society.</p>
<h3>Scholarship Donor Titles</h3>
<p>The scholarship received yesterday included 500 yuan from Jinshengchang Company, 500 yuan from Jin Jiqiu, 100 yuan from Qian Yintang, 40 yuan from Zhu Gengliang, 30 yuan from Mr. Li, and 10 yuan each from Zheng Shencheng, Zhu Zhenhuan, and Pu Qiting (in memory of Su Yizhi, a female teacher at Shengxin Elementary School). A total of 1,200 yuan in reserve notes was received. The remaining balance is 362,805 yuan and 59 cents.</p>
<h3>The City Tightens Security for Tomorrow's May 30th Anniversary</h3>
<p>Tomorrow (30th) is the local anniversary of the city. The Municipal Police Bureau and the police authorities of the two concessions have begun to tighten security this morning, dispatching all police officers to work in shifts. Patrol teams and security teams are dispatched to patrol the secluded areas within their respective jurisdictions, and search pedestrians. Those with suspicious appearances must be strictly interrogated and their citizen certificates or residence permits must be checked. Therefore, citizens must carry their citizen certificates with them when going out for inspection. The Japanese military authorities also assisted the police authorities in searching public places such as hotels.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Welfare Association Welcomes Ambassador Sawada</h3>
<p>Former Ambassador Sawada to France, accompanied by Minister Yui, flew from Tokyo to Shanghai on the 25th, and will go to Hankou, Nanjing, and then north to inspect. In order to express welcome, the Municipal Welfare Association, at the same time, because Counselor Nakamura of the embassy was recently honorably transferred to the position of Minister to Finland, and will return to the country to take office soon, the association expressed farewell, and held a tea party at the Kangle Hotel at 4:30 pm yesterday (28th), and invited people from the city's industrial, commercial, and journalistic circles to participate. The guests included Ambassador Sawada, Minister Yui, Minister Nakamura, and on the side of the guest country, Embassy General Manager Okazaki, Secretary-General Honno, Consul Nakata, Consul Iwai, Tatsichiro Iwata, Kiyoshi Iwamoto, and Masao Kawasaki, etc. On the Chinese side, Zhang Yipeng, Wu Kaisheng, Chen Shao-wei, Ding Fubao, Xiang Kangyuan, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Su Xiwu, Wang Boyuan, Chen Qiushi, Tan Shuzhan, Yu Zhongxian, Xu Shihua, Cheng Zhongquan, and Shen Guanzhun, Tang Jusheng, etc., were chaired by Lin Kanghou.</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou's Speech</p>
<p>Ambassador Sawada, Minister Yui, Minister Nakamura, distinguished guests, we are deeply honored to have the presence of the guests of honor and distinguished guests today. We know that Ambassador Sawada, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, and Ambassador Tani to China are very close friends, and they are all outstanding talents in the Japanese diplomatic circle. This time, accompanying Minister Yui to China for inspection, we hope that the ambassador will observe and listen to the intentions of the Chinese people, and bring this intention back to Japan, as the main basis for Japan's future policy of cooperation with China. This policy is the most practical cooperation policy. The Shanghai Municipal Welfare Association represents the Shanghai citizens in seeking welfare, and it is also an institution for citizens to express their intentions. The significance of today's meeting is just this. We have heard that Ambassador Sawada's elder brother has also served as an ambassador, and it is very rare for both brothers to be ambassadors, and the faces of the brothers are very similar, and it is easy to be mistaken, which is a beautiful story in the international diplomatic circle. We hope that after the ambassador returns to China after the inspection, he will convey the intentions of the Chinese people to the Tokyo authorities, and the friendly relations between China and Japan will be further advanced from now on. And the brothers' ambassadors more symbolize that China and Japan become the two major countries of brothers in East Asia, and cooperate to undertake the same mission, which will be regarded as a permanent beautiful story in later history, and Ambassador Sawada will surely be happy to work hard. Mr. Nakamura has been stationed in China for many years, and he is a friend of China. In recent years, he has devoted much effort to the friendship between China and Japan. Now that he has been honorably transferred to the position of Minister to Finland, we hope that even though the Minister is away from China, he will continue to care about and cooperate with the friendly relations between China and Japan. We sincerely welcome and bid farewell, and wish you all success in your work and good health. Then Ambassador Sawada and Mr. Zhang Yipeng delivered speeches, and the meeting was adjourned at 6:30 pm.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Circles Collectively Solicit Donations to Relieve the Disaster in North China, Calligraphers and Collectors Promote Charity Sales to Help Relieve Disaster</h3>
<p>Since the mobilization of donations for disaster relief in North China, the response from all parties has been increasingly enthusiastic. Various groups and schools have launched collective fundraising, accumulating small amounts into large amounts, which is exemplary. It is hoped that industry leaders will rise to the occasion and join in the good deeds. The newspaper's donation collection has now reached more than 200,000 yuan, but the disaster area is vast and the needs are huge. A drop in the bucket is difficult to solve the problem. I dare to ask all sectors to assist as soon as possible. The workers and other employees of various factories, in accordance with the duty of mutual assistance among human beings, are requested to collect and submit the information to the newspaper for collection and disclosure. Yesterday, we received a letter from the workers of Yufeng Yarn Factory, saying that Shanghai is not lacking in wealthy magnates, and it seems that they have not fully responded to the newspaper's call. Otherwise, with a simple effort, it would not be difficult to collect a huge amount of money, etc. We are deeply disturbed by this. Now, North China is in desperate need of rescue. I believe that the magnates in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles will be able to make a high call and appeal for the people in distress.</p>
<p>Military Amateur Team Comes to Shanghai for Charity Matches</p>
<p>The Nanjing Military Amateur Basketball Team, in order to seek relief for the disaster-stricken compatriots in North China, has specially organized a team to come to Shanghai to conduct friendly matches with Shanghai's strong teams, Xingren, Hualian, and Xilian. The dates are set for three days, June 5th, 6th, and 7th. All ticket income will be used to relieve the urgent disaster in North China in order to fulfill the meaning of disaster relief. It is reported that this move has been negotiated and organized by the city's Education Bureau.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhongyuan's Fan Surface Helps Disaster Relief</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received a letter from calligrapher Zhang Zhongyuan, which roughly stated that in view of the severity of the disaster in North China, starting from today, he will specially order Luoyang fans, each single-sided fan for 100 yuan, and double-sided fan for 200 yuan, temporarily limited to 500 fans (public collection of pieces for seven days). The fees and the names of the consigners will be sent to the newspaper for transfer to the North China Disaster Relief Association (the donation receipt will be given to the consigner separately). Collection points: (1) Dahuaxu Company, 2nd Floor, 7 The Bund, (2) Zhang Wanli Wood Company, 77 Zhili Road, (3) Haiyuan Daguan Art Garden, Haige Road. Mr. Zhang is righteous and public-spirited, which is a model to be emulated.</p>
<p>Charity Sale of Han Qi's Relics</p>
<p>Mr. Meng Wangqu of the Southeast Trust Company, 34 Aiduya Road, wrote: "Recently, I found a painting by Six Boat Monk, Song Dynasty, a hall in Lingyan Temple, with inscriptions by various people from the Jiaqing and Daoguang periods. After investigation, this cliff has been missing for a long time, and the Six Boat rubbings have long become orphans in the country. Now, I have set an initial value of 5,000 yuan for charity sales, and all the proceeds will be used to relieve the disaster, so as to fulfill my wish to help." The enthusiastic good deeds are worthy of admiration. I still hope that philanthropists and lovers of antiquities will go to negotiate directly.</p>

<h3>Count Kuroda Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Count Kuroda Kiyoshi of Japan, a prominent figure in the Japanese cultural world and currently the managing director of the Japan International Culture Promotion Association, recently visited our country, traveling to various places in Beiping and Nanjing, and had cordial talks with the cultural circles. The impression was very satisfactory. He arrived in Shanghai from Beijing at 7:20 am yesterday. He will stay in Shanghai for about ten days. The Japan International Culture Promotion Association is an organization in Japan that promotes cultural exchanges around the world. The books and magazines it has published in the past have been sold in Europe and the United States. For the academic essay collection commemorating the 2,600th anniversary of the Japanese Era, scholars and celebrities from various countries were invited to write articles, and Zhou Zuoren and Qian Daosun also participated in the mourning, such as the article "Re-Understanding Japan". It is reported that the cultural circles of the city will hold a grand welcome for Count Kuroda's visit. Recently, the International Culture Promotion Association plans to hold an exhibition of famous Japanese paintings in the city.</p>
<h3>Liu Haisu Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Liu Haisu, president of Shanghai Art College and a master of contemporary art, left Shanghai in the 29th year of the Republic of China and went to Hong Kong, Java, Singapore, and other places to hold art exhibitions, which were well-received in Southeast Asia. During this period, he stayed in Batavia, Java, for the longest time. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, he was still residing in Batavia. It is reported that he has now safely arrived in Shanghai after traveling tens of thousands of miles.</p>
<h3>Su Yizhi's Teacher's Corpse is Dissected for Autopsy</h3>
<p>Su Yizhi, a female teacher at Shengxin Elementary School, 393 Pingliang Road, was punishing a student, Liu Zhijun, for violating school rules. Liu's mother, a woman from Anhui named Liu Wang, insulted Su, and Su died as a result. The police sent Liu Wang to the First Special Court and requested her detention, and sent Su's body to the coroner's office. After the prosecutor of the First Special Court and forensic doctor Hou Guangdi examined the body, Hou conducted a re-autopsy on the 28th of the month, and took out Su's internal organs, etc., and sent them to the Public Works Department's Health Office for chemical examination. Because the procedure for this chemical examination is complicated, the results of the chemical examination will not be clear until a week later.</p>
<h3>Dongye Chuanqi, Yuan Sheng Feng Ji Guan, Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Dongye Chuanqi, specially appointed by the National Government as the Yuan Sheng Feng Si Guan (Official in Charge of Sacrifices to Confucius), arrived in Shanghai after completing his official duties in Nanjing. He has been warmly welcomed by various circles in China and Japan in recent days. Accompanying him were Jiang Kanghu, President of the Examination Yuan; Zhou Lingshu, a member of the Cultural Relics Preservation Committee; fellow Shandong natives residing in Shanghai; and local celebrities, all of whom hosted banquets in succession. Cultural figures from friendly nations, such as Director Sato of the Institute of Natural Sciences, Chief Fuzaki of the East Asia Research Institute, and Professor Ozawa of the Tongwen Academy University, extended particularly warm hospitality, unanimously stating that respecting the way of the sage is a necessary and urgent task for the revival of East Asia. Japan has grown strong by adhering to Confucianism, and the revival of our motherland, as well as the cultural development of Greater East Asia, should also be based on it. It is said that Mr. Dongye's visit is for sightseeing and visiting local literati, and he will return to his residence in Qufu on June 1st to preside over the upper and lower sacrificial ceremonies of the fifth month of the lunar calendar.</p>
<h3>Stevedores at Qiujiang Wharf Embezzle Huge Sums, Ordered to Mediate</h3>
<p>Lin Qingyuan, the nephew of former Jiangsu High Court President Lin Biao, recently contracted for the loading and unloading of imported goods at the Hongkou Qiujiang Wharf. The workers were hired by Lin through Fang Derong, Zhang Zhaorong, Zhang Guilin, Chen Yuanhong, etc., who served as foremen, supervisors, translators, etc., handling the hiring, moving, loading, and unloading of goods. Fang and others colluded with each other to commit fraud, embezzling a huge sum of over 180,000 yuan. This was discovered by Lin, who then hired lawyer Lin Yingqing and filed a private prosecution against Fang and others in the Special First Court. After the judge opened the court for trial, he ordered the defendants to quickly go out and mediate to avoid severe criminal punishment, and then ordered a postponement for further hearing.</p>

<p>Economic Circle - Commentary</p>
<h3>Raising Price Ceilings</h3>
<p>The authorities have already raised the price ceilings for several commodities. For example, the price ceiling for gold has been raised to 5,000 yuan per tael, and the price ceiling for newsprint has been raised to 950 yuan per ream. Those who do not study the principles of raising price ceilings generally believe that once the price ceiling is raised, the black market price will inevitably continue to rise. However, the facts tell us that the black market price of gold has already fallen within the 5,000 yuan price ceiling range; the black market price of paper, which exceeds the price ceiling range, is also insignificant. From this, it can be seen that raising the price ceiling is not enough to promote the increasing rise of black market prices; on the contrary, sometimes it can promote the decline of black market prices.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that raising the price ceiling is absolutely not meaningless, because after the price ceiling is raised, the natural results are: (1) Stores are not excessively at a loss in terms of profits, so they will not hoard goods and not sell them; (2) Buyers see that there are goods available in the open market, so they will not seek them in the black market; (3) Black markets see that there are auditors, so they will not hoard and speculate. Therefore, from a theoretical point of view, raising the price ceiling actually achieves three benefits with one action. However, raising the price ceiling should adhere to the first principle of "just enough"; the standard of "just enough" is that when it is determined that there is no way to hoard certain commodities in the black market, then the price ceiling should no longer be raised, but should instead be reduced, because implementing a low-price policy is, after all, a major goal of a controlled economy.</p>
<h3>After the Establishment of the Cotton Industry Special Committee, the Old Cotton Purchase Agency is Dissolved. All Cotton and Cotton Products are Under the Control of the Special Committee.</h3>
<p>Since the Materials Control Review Committee of the National General Chamber of Commerce decided to include four major commodities, including cotton, into the scope of compilation items, a new organization is needed for the compilation of cotton to be responsible for handling it. The "China Central China Cotton Compilation General Association" and the cotton purchase agency, originally organized by the Japanese side, must be dissolved, and the compilation affairs are transferred to the Chamber of Commerce to prepare for handling. It is now known that the Chamber of Commerce has a professional committee for the cotton industry, so after consultation with relevant parties, it was decided to hand over the cotton compilation work to the cotton industry professional committee to be responsible for carrying it out, with the hope of integrating it with the compilation work of cotton products. The main content of this matter is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Cotton Industry Professional Committee under the Chamber of Commerce is the highest control of cotton and cotton products.</p>
<p>(2) The constituent members of the Cotton Industry Professional Committee are the Chinese Cotton Industry Federation, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Cotton Products Industry Federation, and the Japanese Cotton Products Industry Federation and the Japanese Cotton Industry Federation.</p>
<p>(3) The cotton products part will be set up by a council by the Chinese and Japanese industry federations, and the cotton part will also be set up by a council by the Chinese and Japanese sides to facilitate contact.</p>
<p>(4) The Chinese and Japanese cotton industry federations, on the Chinese side, are composed of the Yarn Factory Federation, the Cotton Industry Association, and other associations related to cotton. The Japanese side is composed of the "China Spinning Industry Association," the "Japanese Cotton Bureau Industry Association," and other industry associations related to cotton.</p>
<h3>Reserve Deposit Passbooks Can Be Discounted at the Central Bank</h3>
<p>Qianzhuang banks in Shanghai have previously requested the Central Reserve Bank to borrow cash against deposit reserve passbooks due to tight money and inflexible turnover. The Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank did not dare to make its own decisions on whether the reserve deposit passbooks could be borrowed for cash. After requesting instructions from the Ministry of Finance, it is now known that the Ministry of Finance has approved the accommodation, and the regulations stipulate: (1) A promissory note can be issued for 80% of the amount of the reserve fund that has been deposited to request a discount. (2) The discount period is limited to seven days. (3) The discount rate is set at 12 yuan per thousand yuan per month. It is heard that this method is to mortgage at 80% by means of discounting.</p>
<h3>Real Estate Prices in This City Soar, Many Real Estate Companies are Established</h3>
<p>Recently, the price of real estate in this city has been soaring due to the authorities' strict crackdown on hoarding and speculation, resulting in excessive speculative funds that are difficult to find an outlet for a while, and thus infiltrating into the real estate sector. As a result, real estate transactions are becoming increasingly busy, and real estate prices are also constantly rising.</p>
<h3>Dissolved Guilds Must Immediately Return Seals</h3>
<p>The Municipal Grain Bureau has already implemented organizational adjustments to the various industry guilds engaged in grain business. Some have already been formally established, and the original industry guilds included in the established guilds have been ordered to dissolve, and the Ministry's order to return and cancel the original guild seals has been issued. However, the guild addresses are mostly in the two concessions, so the bureau sent a letter to the authorities of the two concessions to assist in handling the matter, and all the original seals of the guilds were transferred to the bureau with truncated corners for return and cancellation.</p>

<h3>A Perspective on Trainees in Large Companies</h3>
<p>— Zheng Bai</p>
<p>"Trainee" sounds more "elegant" than "apprentice," especially in a company? Even more so in a large company.</p>
<p>We work in high-rise buildings all day long (although we sleep in rented lofts at night), wear "uniform" uniforms, work the hours of the writing room, and have the "easy work" and "generous treatment" that outsiders imagine... These are all so good. Look, who doesn't envy mentioning a large company? The fame is so loud that it penetrates the clouds. However, the famous may not have the real. This illusory reputation and appearance do not know how many young people are lured to seek this job, and finally embark on a narrow road.</p>
<p>Don't you believe it? Our uniform fee is deducted from our salary. Speaking of salary, it is even more pitiful. I have been "training" for two years, and now I only have more than 20 yuan a month, which is the result of several salary increases of two yuan. Our company does not provide accommodation or breakfast, so a month's income is not enough to drink a bowl of soy milk every day, let alone talk about the rest. Every morning, we first go to the company to clean the "cabinet," and then move out the goods to wait for the market to open. After that, we only hear the east ringing the bell and the west ringing the bell, running around quickly, and we are very busy. I only hate that I can't turn into thousands of bodies to avoid the contempt of the cargo officers. We also often have to move heavy goods from the fourth floor to the ground floor. Someone in our group has already suffered from spitting blood. After closing, we move the goods back to the designated place, then sweep the floor, wipe the tables, and wipe the glass... We have to do all the trivial things. After a hard day, we should have a little time for self-study. The company is very considerate and organized a free training class for us - "forced tutoring," just like parents urging their children, but the content is only English, only teaching English words - all of which are professional nouns and imported goods names. As for grammar, past talks, they are all classified as "unnecessary" and "postponed for explanation." We have to take an hour of so-called "English class" every day, which is tantamount to wasting an hour of our time.</p>
<p>Our work and life seem to be very hard. However, we do not complain, and we always hope to have a day to stand out. However, the company stipulates that trainees can only be promoted to salespersons at most, and there is no further opportunity. The treatment of salespersons is only a few times higher than that of trainees. If you don't rely on doing other business, it is also difficult to maintain life. In this way, the store clerk cannot work with peace of mind, the efficiency is reduced, and the company's losses are also considerable.</p>
<p>Even though our job is not a "golden rice bowl" or a "silver rice bowl," there are still quite a few people who come to snatch it. Therefore, we are often at risk of being "invited by the company to take up another position," and this problem becomes serious. After the trainees in small shops are dismissed by the boss, they have already gained some experience. Therefore, they can always find a way to make a living anywhere in the world. Only our group, especially the group in the luxurious houses such as floating wine and suits, can only find a way to make a living locally after being dismissed. If you go to a small city, even if you have "trained" to perfection, you will be "a hero without a place to use your skills." Because who in the mainland can afford your noble business? So you have to start as an "apprentice" again, and then the time of several years will be wasted unclearly.</p>

<h3>The Advantages and Disadvantages of Face</h3>
<p>— Chuan Wo</p>
<p>It is undeniable that everyone wants to save "face": even if some people do shameless things behind others' backs, they still use oil to disguise their "face" beautifully and completely, perhaps even more meticulously and "want" it than others. Yes, this is not necessarily a "virtue," "Everyone has the heart to be evil," isn't this "wanting face" in line with "the heart to be evil"?</p>
<p>Some people say: "The social order of China can still be maintained well in this dynamic time, really because we are after all a 'land of propriety and righteousness'." At the same time, I often hear: "Ah... it's about face..." "Alas... face can't..." From this, I suddenly realized that "face" is actually the "guardian" of human ethics and customs in Chinese society. Isn't it true that in order to "want face," the poor pretend to be rich, so there are "fewer" poor people in society; in order to "want face," everyone does their best to be "courteous" when dealing with people, so there is "harmony" and "happiness" in society; in order to "want face," they say "Ha... so-so..." "Hey, everyone is convenient...", so everything in the world is "always beneficial," and the world is "peaceful." However, unfortunately, "where there is a common benefit, there must be its drawbacks," because in order to "want face," everyone unconsciously applies a layer of powder to their faces, and over time, they lose their innocent nature and become strange faces that are good at flattering, good at welcoming, good at pretending to be majestic, and good at wearing masks... I think that the reason why most children are afraid of strangers is probably because they have not seen the world deeply and are not used to this kind of "strange" relationship, right?</p>
<p>Some people are blaming some people for not caring about other people's face and making them feel too embarrassed. This can certainly give some correction to some arrogant people, but they did not expect that some people who squeeze out a dignified "face" on the outside but do all kinds of evil in secret are the biggest obstacles to social progress and the biggest criminals in the formation of human hypocrisy! In my opinion, if someone points out my mistakes in person, pulls down my mask, and makes me "lose face," I would be happy to accept it. But if someone always "gives me face," puts on a full face of disguise, I can't help but feel angry: this is "vulgar," and it is undoubtedly unacceptable in a "ceremonial society."</p>
<p>In fact, as long as it is not deliberate, not emotional, but correct teaching or rebuke, what does it matter if the "face" - the paper that inherits people's thoughts - is torn? On the contrary, in order to show respect for the other party's "face" without pointing out their mistakes, and pretending to be a "face" to cater to them and win their favor, is no different from ruining the conscience and personality of both of us! Therefore, instead of pretending to have "face" and desperately wanting "face," it is better to lose it and have everyone stand up frankly and say something true! Otherwise, before the "courtesy" is finished, the society will already be in danger!</p>
<h3>Reality, Ideals, and Humor</h3>
<p>— Yuan Gu</p>
<p>Lin Yutang once said, "Humor can prevent idealists from hitting their heads against the stone wall of reality and being severely hit, and it can also ease the tension of those irritable enthusiasts and make them live longer." His meaning is that reality can indeed support lofty wisdom or thoughts. However, humor is also a tool for adjusting ideals and reality, so that they can be properly combined.</p>
<p>Indeed, the position of a person who specializes in reality is very stable. As long as he can understand everything he has at present and make appropriate efforts, he will never fail. However, this kind of life is too monotonous and too mechanical. It's like a fisherman who can only fish. A pole and a cage represent everything he has. He just sits by the river all day long. Of course, the fish in the cage are enough for him to live on. However, he does not know that modern new fishing machines can catch his fish for several days in a matter of minutes and moments, and the cost is less than half of his.</p>
<p>On the other hand, an idealist will never be as stable as the former. They always plan many themes that transcend reality every day, and fantasize about everything in the future, especially in terms of material enjoyment and spiritual pleasure, holding great hopes and extravagance; you must know that these hopes and extravagance are accumulating the roots of harm. On a personal level, this excessive hope makes them suffer. Broadly speaking, if a nation also has this kind of desire, then the whole society will be shaken.</p>
<p>Life is a polymorphic mixture of reality and ideals. If the mixture is accurate and appropriate, then life is interesting, and accuracy and appropriateness depend entirely on humor to adjust. It's like a worker who has worked for eight hours needs sleep, it can reduce your unnecessary fantasies and grasp reality; sometimes it can cultivate your ideals and give your reality a rest.</p>
<h3>Dispatch from the Front Lines (3)</h3>
<p>— Written by Mr. Hamamoto of the Naval Reporting Team</p>
<p>5. The Spirit of the Chivalrous Warrior</p>
<p>"If the men of the 'Kurogane' torpedo boat were to go ashore, even the tearful little beggars in Chinese cities would reportedly hide under the beds."</p>
<p>"Perhaps not that extreme, but if they were timid soldiers, they would reportedly often give way."</p>
<p>Upon hearing such talk, Edo Kantarō, who grew up on a crude freighter, could imagine what kind of character the 'Kurogane' torpedo boat he would be serving on would have.</p>
<p>"Hey, before you serve on that boat, you have to stand up for it," Lieutenant Matsumae said with a smile. The members of the reporting team always added some exaggeration to the 'Kurogane's' character.</p>
<p>"First of all, that boat's captain is a real eccentric. The captain is a classmate and contemporary of Major Kōmoto of Nanchang, who died in a plane crash, and later transferred to the fleet. I can't say for sure if this is true, but I know he admires Leader Shimizu no Jirochō; otherwise, he wouldn't hang his picture in his bedroom."</p>
<p>"I can't say for sure, but lately, on the training ground, he has been using a terrible, violent training method to train the soldiers. Even if you just stand by and watch, you can always tell they are from the 'Kurogane.' The captain often appears suddenly from behind and gives everyone a lecture. All training is not enough to have a simple style. Even if the result is a little bit good, if there is no spirit, it is shallow in the battlefield. Training is not work, but spirit, so he tells everyone about the chivalrous warrior Shimizu no Jirochō, whom he admires, and the anecdotes of Leader Ketsurō. Sometimes, he calls the quartermaster and says, 'The soldiers are sweating too much, pour coffee into the buckets and let them drink!' 'You won't see that kind of coffee-drinking method anywhere in the South Seas,'" someone said with a laugh.</p>
<p>"Perhaps not. However, in the end, it's more like water than coffee. But the soldiers are moved by the spirit of this captain."</p>
<p>"I heard that captain only has two orders."</p>
<p>"When enemy planes are spotted, he orders to fire upwards, and when enemy submarines are spotted, he orders to launch torpedoes." Someone said, making a commanding gesture when saying "fire upwards" and "launch torpedoes."</p>
<p>"Then he just instructs the gunners and torpedo men to go to the appropriate places, and because he always gets results, he's amazing!"</p>
<p>"That's a bit strange!" Lieutenant Matsumae suddenly protested.</p>
<p>"However, because it's a small ship, you can't really talk about it in terms of formal warfare conditions," Lieutenant Matsumae added, confirming that statement.</p>
<p>"Has anyone on the reporting team ever been on the 'Kurogane'?" Nanjō asked.</p>
<p>"Although I haven't been on it, I know a lot of people in their 'family.' Among them are the executive officer, Ōmasa, and the engineering lieutenant, Komasa. Ōmasa is a second-dan in kendo, and Komasa is a fourth-dan in judo, which adds up to six dan, and they often boast about it. There's also someone called Yonaka Asata, who was reportedly a sumo wrestler in the naval corps. He's the friendliest of them all. Lately!"</p>
<p>The bald reporter stretched out his legs and said that. The fact that this group of reporters particularly admired the 'Kurogane family' was evident from the beginning of the conversation.</p>
<p>This is the story of the "Kurogane Family" told by the bald reporter stretching out his legs.</p>
<p>It was on a night when the moon was full that this group of reporters went to a banquet halfway up the mountain.</p>
<p>The banquet hall was in the middle of the back of the mountain, two kilometers from the ship's pier. The fragrant, pale red Indian frangipani and the eight-petaled calla lilies were just as beautiful at night, blooming by the windows. The officers who came here called this place, which had a panoramic view of the entire port, the Ben Nevis of the South Seas (the highest mountain in the United Kingdom). The officers' room was used for banquets for those coming ashore and those going to war, and they often brought a lot of beer and canned food, sitting on tatami mats in the Japanese style and feasting.</p>
<p>"Reporting team, come over here!"</p>
<p>Upon hearing the call, they looked over and saw their own captain, surrounded by the heroes and brave men of the "Kurogane Family," all with angry expressions on their faces.</p>
<p>Surprised, they said, "What's going on?" and before their butt could even land on the chair, they said, "I'm currently reading a report, from my old senior, or rather, the captain of the destroyer I used to serve on. Please forgive me for not revealing the name, it's the final report of a certain unit commander, everyone listen!" Suddenly showing a look of great admiration, they began to recite in a crisp voice.</p>
<p>"Due to intense enemy fire, our positions are gradually being breached, and our brave soldiers are constantly counterattacking with suicide attacks, inflicting great losses on the enemy, but our side..."</p>
<p>In a solemn low voice, not intentionally tinged with a little sadness.</p>
<p>"For more than forty days of engagement with the enemy, regardless of military personnel or civilian staff, everyone has done their utmost to fulfill their duties. I am very grateful for the guidance of my superiors, the cooperation of the air force, and the combined operations of the army. I wish for the prosperity of the Imperial Nation and the long-lasting good fortune of all officers. The End."</p>
<p>The captain, who had been reciting with his eyes closed, had two lines of hot tears streaming down his cheeks. The executive officer, Ōmasa, and the others did not say a word for a while. After a moment, Lieutenant Komasa, the chief engineer, suddenly trembled on his pale face and stood up, saying, "Revenge, revenge!"</p>
<p>"Don't be impatient!"</p>
<p>The captain scolded them, saying that. Then he asked the reporter, "How is it? Haven't you thought of an article yet?"</p>
<p>They specially called the reporting team to read the will of their predecessor (which has now become a will), and also to hear various thoughts from the reporters who make a living by writing, perhaps to prove that their own criticism was not wrong.</p>
<p>But the emotional members of the reporting team had been listening angrily from the beginning, and never thought about the quality of the article in their hearts. As for discussion and criticism, they felt that it was something that should not be done.</p>
<p>At this moment, the command post suddenly sounded an alarm. Perhaps an enemy reconnaissance plane had come to scout under the moonlight. After hearing the alarm, generally speaking, there was still thirty minutes before the enemy plane flew over the city.</p>
<p>Even so, the flustered captain kicked the tatami mat, indicating, "Hurry up and go!"</p>
<p>"It's still early, there's no need to panic!"</p>
<p>The reporters said with a laugh. Then Ōmasa, who was standing nearby, stared with a pitiful look and said forcefully:</p>
<p>"We are not avoiding the alarm, we are going back to the boat to prepare for an attack. Tonight, we won't let a single plane go, we will shoot them all down."</p>
<p>Before these words were finished, the shadows of the heroes and brave men had already disappeared from the room. (Tō: Translated from Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of the Japanese Navy (5)</h3>
<p>— Ōshita Udaer</p>
<p>At 1:55 PM on May 27, 1905, on the flagship Mikasa, a signal flag known throughout the world was raised high: "The fate of the Empire rests on this battle, all officers and men must strive harder!"</p>
<p>Although very brief, such a powerful, sincere, and heroic statement is rare. Whether in the event of an incident or in battle, all kinds of orders emanate from this.</p>
<p>In the Battle of Coral Sea, the enemy's large mobile force, centered on the aircraft carriers Saratoga and Yorktown, plus the battleships North Carolina class and California class, and the British battleship Warspite, was surrounded by our fleet and aircraft. Soon, when the time for the planned decisive battle was ripe, the 〇〇 captain on board the 〇〇 gave the following instructions to the entire crew through the speaking tube:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen! You have all been trained into the world's only arms. Now your training has come to fruition. The time is near when those arms will show their colors! Do it! Do it with confidence! As long as we do that, victory is ours!"</p>
<p>The captain's tone was firm and sincere, and in the power of his words, there was a kind of affectionate tone like a father instructing his son. The crew were moved by that tone, their spirits were uplifted, they became joyful, and their courage flared up like fire. So the gunners prayed to the guns, sprinkled sake on the torpedoes, filled with confidence that every shot would hit, each took their place, and completed the perfect battle configuration.</p>
<p>In the northern waters of Kolagong, Java, when the British first-class cruiser Exeter was sunk, before the enemy ship had been identified, the captain of the 〇〇 destroyer had already calculated the distance between the two sides, and knew that they would come into contact with the enemy ship around noon, so he wanted to take this opportunity to have the entire crew eat a hearty meal first. Therefore, he issued the command:</p>
<p>"Members! Eat!"</p>
<p>That was the first order in this battle. The enemy was the latest and most advanced first-class cruiser that Britain boasted of, and it was accompanied by destroyers. But our side had only two destroyers, yet they dared to challenge it and immediately sank the enemy into the seabed of the Java Sea. The Exeter was one of the British cruiser groups that attacked the German pocket battleship Graf Spee in the South American River Plate. A small Japanese destroyer avenged the allied nations. At the beginning of the war, our naval aircraft also sank the Prince of Wales off the coast of Malaya, avenging the German battleship Bismarck. The spirit of Admiral Spee and the German naval heroes who died on the Bismarck are probably smiling! This is a tragic and beautiful marine interlude.</p>
<p>Soldiers are different from great thinkers, orators, and writers; they are not good at these things. Soldiers only know how to move forward bravely, only know the warrior's duty, and thus many famous generals have emerged.</p>
<p>In a certain naval battle of the Russo-Japanese War, a certain captain did not say a word to the entire crew from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Later, he finally spoke. Only one sentence:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen! Excellent! Catch up!"</p>
<p>"Excellent" is a word of praise and encouragement. It was originally used when praising and reciting poetry. Now, in military schools, this phrase can often be heard. (Different: Translated from Western Asahi Shimbun.)</p>

<h3>Female Teacher Dies After Being Beaten and Humiliated; All Circles Donate Condolence Money</h3>
<p>The case of Su Yizhi, a female teacher at Sacred Heart Elementary School in Hongkou, who died after being beaten and humiliated by Liu Wangshi, a student's family member, has aroused public outrage in educational and women's circles, and they have successively advocated punishing the murderer and providing compensation to the family. Yesterday, this newspaper received five hundred yuan from the colleagues of E Shun Chang firm on behalf of Su Yizhi's family, one hundred yuan each from Shen Suicheng, Ye Yipei, and Chen Bi, fifty yuan from Zhang Tinggui, and twenty yuan each from Xu Jiajun, Gu Kuilin, Sun Jinyuan, and Bao Dafang, totaling nine hundred and thirty yuan.</p>
<h3>On Liu Wangshi's Beating and Humiliating Su Yizhi</h3>
<p>— Shuping</p>
<p>The "Guoyu" says: "People are born from three, treat them as one: the father gives birth to them, the ruler feeds them, and the teacher teaches them." The "Book of Rites" says: "Serving the ruler, serving the father, and serving the teacher all require diligent service to the point of death." This means that teachers are respected equally with rulers and fathers, which is an ancient teaching of our country. If a person is a citizen but does not obey the government's orders, he is a rebel; if a child does not listen to his parents' instructions, he is a rebel; is not a student who disobeys a teacher's punishment in the same category as a rebel?</p>
<p>Punishment as a form of education is mentioned in the "Shangshu," and the use of rods to maintain discipline is seen in the "Book of Rites." Even in schools in this city, it often happens that students are punished for poor character or neglected studies. However, it is shocking and unheard of for a student's parents to dote on their children, beat and humiliate teachers, causing them to commit suicide out of resentment.</p>
<p>Let us ask, what was Su Yizhi's intention in punishing Liu Zhijun? It was nothing more than wanting Liu Zhijun not to neglect his studies and to be able to pass his grades. Is it not also fair to say that she was fulfilling her duties to the best of her ability? School authorities are always happy to have talented people, and students should never complain. Parents should always be grateful for the teachers' enthusiastic teaching. Yet, Liu Wangshi not only did not thank Su Yizhi but hated her like an enemy and beat and humiliated her. If such an ignorant and悍婦 is not severely punished, then the trend of students disobeying instruction will inevitably worsen day by day, and teachers will all be terrified and fearful. Then who will be willing to fulfill their duties to the best of their ability and enthusiastically teach their students? Is this not a blow to the education community? If we still hope for the efforts of teachers and the cultivation of talent under these circumstances, are we not trying to prevent them from entering? Therefore, if we want teachers to work hard and cultivate talent, we must severely punish Liu Wangshi. In this way, the grievances of the deceased can be somewhat relieved, and the arrogance of the ignorant 悍婦 in the world who only know how to spoil their children and despise teachers can also be curbed.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Educational Association Gives Preferential Treatment to Teachers</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhou 　ren, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Educational Association, wrote to inform us that the Shenbao is admired for its noble spirit of seeking welfare for impoverished primary and secondary school teachers and staff. The Association is currently issuing membership cards to teachers and staff members of various schools. In order to identify current primary and secondary school teachers who are ill, please use this card to apply to the Shenbao for free treatment. A sample of the card is enclosed for your reference and verification. (It is noted that teachers' salaries are the most meager. This newspaper has initiated a medical aid fund. Members of the Association who are ill can come to this newspaper with their membership cards to obtain application forms, which will be approved as appropriate, as a small expression of respect for teachers.)</p>
<p>Seeking Apprentices: A certain needle factory on Xiaoshadu Road in this city is seeking three apprentices. Those who are excellent, have a junior high school education, and are physically strong will be qualified. Room and board will be provided, and a monthly living allowance of fifty yuan will be given. Those who are interested should submit their applications to this office within two days. If suitable, they will be contacted.</p>
