<p>社評</p>
<h3>談青年運動</h3>
<p>靑年是朝陽·是春　·是怒濤·有着無限的光輝·溫暖·生機和前途，這是從靑年本身說的。靑年是國家的命脈，社會的柱石，未來人類命運的主宰者，這是從靑年在國家社會和人類的地位說的。因爲靑年有着這些特點，所以靑年時代，是可歌可泣，可聖可狂的時代。別國且不去說，單就我國來說，古往今來，不知有多少靑年，爲着國家，爲着社會，爲着全人　的命運，光榮的奮鬥，使天下多少中年人爲之慚愧，老年人爲之感嘆。</p>
<p>目前中國是處在一個新的時代，在這一個新時代裏，能不能沒有靑年人參加呢？不，不能的。能不能在離開現實而空談靑年運動呢？不，不能的。目前是需要重振靑年運動的時代。然而，第一個問題是希望誰來領導靑年運動？我們認爲靑年運動的領導者，一定要自己的心身純潔無瑕，一定要言行完全合一而可做靑年人的規模，一定要有着高尙純潔的人格，一定要具有正確的思想，而且能澈底了解現代中國靑年人的心理與志趣，能够爲滿足現代中國靑年那些正常的欲求而奮鬥的人。</p>
<p>其次，鑒於目前時代的艱苦，鑒於戰爭的長期化，政府當局對於靑年運動應有整個的政策，這個政策必須針對中國的歷史，中國的社會實情和中國靑年的共同的心理；否則，一味抄襲外國的靑運制度，一味模仿外國的靑運方針，結果就一定只是「吃力不討好」。重慶政權六年來的靑年運動的慘敗，正因爲不顧國情，一味抄襲外國。這裏尤其値得一提的，要絕對一反重慶政權所實行的葬送靑年運動的特務制度，這種特務制度，不知犧牲了多少千萬無辜的純潔的靑年，不知戕喪了國家社會多少千萬可親可愛有作有爲的靑年幹部。同時，也就是替共產黨製造機會。再次，當局對於靑年，要存慈愛扶育的心，視每一個靑年都是自己的子弟，縱使子弟走錯了路，或是由於愛國家愛社會的動機而不幸走錯了路，應該用勸導說服的方法，用慈愛忠實的態度，去感化他，去感動他，我們可以說，決沒有一個不可以眞誠感化的頑劣不肖的。在靑年本身方面，在目前新時代中，首先應該反對對於國家民族及靑年運動悲觀失望的情緒，應該反對一般做太平百姓和失去戰時應有態度的言行，更應該反對消沉腐敗。「羣居終日，言不及　」的風氣，因爲靑年人這種情緒，態度和風氣，才正是當前最危險的現象。這裏，一方面希望當局以光風霽月的態度，以慈愛溫和的方法，盡力消除靑年人面前的暗雲；一方面更希望靑年人本身認淸現實，把握住正確的人生觀，加緊　　，求學做人，不稍鬆懈。</p>

<p>柏林二十六日海通社電　德軍在斯達林格勒區之英勇抵抗、此間昨晚各報一致加以譽揚、並透露德第六軍與羅馬尼亞軍隊二師在斯達林格勒區已陷入嚴重之境地中、德軍目前所取之防禦戰略、其目的乃在遏阻蘇軍之進展、東綫各段今以斯達林格勒所受壓力爲最大、彼處德軍將士之英勇抵抗、厥功最偉、不但為今人所稱讚、亦將永垂後世、</p>

<h3>羅美爾抵馬勒斯城　集中軍隊設防固守　奧塞爾蒂亞流域曾有激戰　德佔領傑倍波達波斯山脈</h3>
<p>柏林二十五日哈瓦斯社電</p>
<p>間軍界人士頃談稱、羅美爾將軍部下、在里比亞與突尼西亞交界處、雖遭英國機羣不斷轟炸、但已避免與敵軍接觸、損失甚微、並已越過突尼西亞邊界、所有摩托化部　及步　均已安然無恙、羅美爾將軍刻正在馬勒斯城（與突尼西亞邊界　去七十英里）集中部隊、按馬　城在戰前業由法方設防、頗爲彙、預料德軍扼守該地、常　持久、</p>
<p>柏林二十六日海通社電　羅美爾將軍在突尼西亞所指揮之軸心軍、今已不受敵軍之阻力、此在蒙特戈姆萊亦所承認、當一月二十四日與二十五日、德義聯軍向西北撤退之　、蒙特戈姆萊未自南面襲擊德　聯軍之側翼、實已坐失良機、且蒙特戈姆萊　　襲擊軸心軍側冀、已有三星期之久、今則未獲實現、由此可知英軍作戰之未能指揮如意、今英軍之陣地攻勢亦已受頓挫、前日英軍前鋒與軸心軍曾發生接觸、但亦遭失敗、日前英方似先須調整其供應根據地、整理其軍隊、然後再可言戰、且軸心軍得地形之利、可以坐收以逸待勞、同時軸心軍在突尼西亞之兵力、日見雄厚、供應問題亦已獲解決、且突尼西亞之要衝、均在軸心軍控制中、故敵軍常不致再能獲逞、</p>
<p>羅馬二十六日海通社電　今午義軍戰報稱、一月十九日至二十四日間、軸心軍在突尼西亞俘獲敵兵四千名、奪獲或擊毀敵坦克車十三輛、砲七十尊、汽車約二百輛、機關槍約一百挺及其他戰具無數、特利波里西部、昨僅有斥堠戰、突尼西亞敵軍來犯被擊退、毀其裝甲車八輛、德議機擊落敵機四架、高射砲擊落敵機一架、於一月二十二日晚在巴齊諾被擊落之英機一架、茲經查明已擊落於海中、敵機襲阿伏拉及阿瑪比里瑪、地面損失輕微、地中海內義潛艇擊沉敵艦保護下之一八〇〇〇噸運輸艦一艘、</p>
<p>瑞士京城廿五日哈瓦社電頃據軸心國與英·美方面消息、突尼西亞奧塞爾蒂亞流域、昨日激戰未已、北非洲協約國聯軍總司令部發表戰報稱、德軍在該處所採取之攻勢、業已停止、但德軍業已佔領傑倍波達波斯山脈、英美　羣、昨日轟炸比塞大港、法國分裂派司令部亦發表戰報稱、勒克萊爾將軍部下、自乍特湖北開、已抵傑倍梅福　山脈、法軍並在突尼西亞南　加夫　區作戰、良以突　西亞南部益見重要、將爲軸心軍左右兩冀取得聯絡之處故也、但據柏林羅馬消息、昨日　有局部戰爭、結果軸心軍稍獲成就、鹵獲俘虜多名、並佔領軍略要　數處、德國機羣賡續轟炸協約國交通綫及阿爾及里亞沿岸之航運、</p>
<p>瑞典京城廿六日海通社電倫敦電訊、英京政界人士對突尼西亞戰局發展之遲鈍及英第八軍追擊德義聯軍失敗等情、頗表失望、報章輿論亦然、「每日電聞報」軍事訪員著稱、倘謂羅美爾將軍兵力單薄、不能扼守所謂瑪勒塞防綫、則屬大謬不然、英著名軍事評論家哈特亦在「每日郵報」稱、蒙特戈姆萊未能切斷羅美爾將軍之軍隊、英國陸軍部亦不應辭其咎、倘英國能及時運用受有訓練之傘兵及運輸飛機、則蒙特戈姆萊當能設法在德·義聯軍之後方登陸、將德·義軍隊加以包圍、證諸北非所得之經騐、吾人殊難將戰事轉移至西歐、</p>
<h3>美糧食生產減少　將嚴格實行配給　普通物價指數均見增加</h3>

<h3>芬政界領袖　訪問瑞典</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十六日海通社電</p>
<p>此間報紙對芬蘭內閣閣員與芬蘭社會民主黨領袖於週末訪問瑞典、持保留態度、關於此次訪問之呂的、除謠傳外、並無透露、瑞典人民對芬蘭之命運甚爲關心、尤於最近數　內更甚、此間對美國與芬蘭間之復交極爲注意、關於芬蘭下屆總統之選舉、亦爲此間討論之目標、瑞典方面對東綫之局勢亦甚重視、蓋蘇聯對芬蘭之壓力加重、則瑞典自東方之威脅亦有增加、</p>
<h3>北非僵局下之英美　企圖在巴爾幹再蠢動　挽回目前北非之頹勢</h3>
<p>英美所喧嚷之北非作戰，其勢已不如當初之盛，登陸迄今二月有餘，一方面遭受軸心軍隊之猛烈還擊，爲之兩頓挫。同時本身　綫內，則有達蘭之被暗殺，季勞與特戈爾之對立，自相暗鬥，醜態畢露。英美爲彌補此次之失敗。不得不力謀振作，並圖挽回頹勢於其他地域，乃在東地中海及西亞方面另覓新戰塲，而呈其蠢動之兆。其眞相如何，當為世人所渴念。本報特以國際長途電話，微詢特　員榎本君，聽取其報吿。榎本君駐土耳其已有年餘，最近考察巴爾幹新情勢而至柏林。</p>
<p>本報　據最近外國電報，盛傳美軍在基普羅斯島登陸，伊朗發生暴動，西亞一帶人民對英美軍隊感情惡化，英美蘇環繞於土耳其之外交非常活躍，德軍加強克里特島與愛琴海諸島之防務，以及繼德羅首腦會談後保加利亞陸長之訪德等，此類西亞與東地中海方面之風雲，均予人以不可捉摸之感。於比種種，頗願得一總括報吿，茲請先就西亞方面之動態述之。</p>
<p>榎本　最近之西亞情勢，最堪注目奢，厥爲美國之軍事進出益趨積極化，現在自巴力斯坦以至叙利亞，伊拉克，伊朗各地，美軍之實力，估計約有六萬至八萬，飛機約有四百架。聞美國方面已擬具計劃，預定至本年三月底，增强其兵力至二十五萬。此外尙有英國及其與國波蘭，希臘，南斯拉夫等之軍隊，故現在英美方面在西亞之全部兵力，估計共有二十萬至二十五萬。若美國之增强計劃能照預定實現，則至三月底時，英美方面之全部兵力，當達到四十萬。現在基普羅斯島上集中美國之空軍轟炸隊，以及英國之奇襲部隊，希臘軍隊等，正作反攻東南歐作戰之準備。英美方面之計劃，似可認爲預期於三四月時，陰謀於巴爾幹諸國，策動罷工及暴動，以圖搗亂軸心方面之巴爾幹戰綫後方，一方面由集結於西亞方面之軍隊，先行襲擊基普羅斯以及多得卡呢斯諸島，以相呼應，繼援前次大戰之例，圖在爾羅尼加登陸作戰。而在土耳其方面，英美亦對土耳其與叙利亞國境以及愛琴海沿岸地方色雷西亞半島一帶，開入多數之英，美，澳洲，紐西蘭等軍隊，從事於飛機塲，塹壕，兵營，道路等之建設。</p>
<p>本報　盛傳伊朗有糧食暴動等事，可見伊朗國民，對於英美軍隊之感情，似已相當惡化。</p>
<p>榎本　關於伊朗糧食暴動之情報，計有二　。英美蘇方面雖故意誇張伊朗之糧食恐慌，然據實地視察伊朗近况之旅客情報，伊朗之糧食狀態，並未如是惡化，糧食暴動之說，母寗爲英美蘇假伊朗國內不靖之名，以圖據大其佔領地帶之一種策略的宣傳。已與軸心宣戰之伊拉克，此次參戰之舉，似爲努里·薩伊德傀儡政權之攝政阿萻茲爾·伊勒，　去年十二月底訪問開羅，與亞力山大以下西亞美軍有腦協讓之結果。聞伊拉克方面提出之參戰條件，爲參加大西洋憲章，戰後保障獨立，並在戰後握有發言權：然自英美方面觀之，則其主要目的，在於先召集伊拉克軍约三師，充當西亞英美軍隊之苦力，並完全佔領伊拉克之軍事根據地。參戰結果，遂使伊拉克國民之反英感情，爲之強化。（丁：譯自一月十九日東京每日新聞）</p>

<h3>華府連日會議　討論應付戰局　歐洲區協約軍統帥　或將由馬歇爾担任　並擬設應付潛艇戰術部</h3>
<p>里期本二十六日同盟社電</p>
<p>據倫敦訊、英國各報昨日紛紛猜測美國陸車參謀總長馬歇爾將軍或將被任爲歐洲戰區協約軍總司令、倫敦每日郵報華盛頓訪電稱、據華盛頓若干「深刻觀察家」之意見、馬歇爾將軍將被任歐洲協約軍之統帥、倫敦新聞記事報亦載未證實華盛頓消息、　艾森霍威爾將軍或將由馬歇爾將軍繼任、按北非法傀儡政權成立後、艾森霍威爾將軍與美國務院代表墨斐·即遭美英公衆之　議、衆信艾森霍威爾擇前法內長貝魯東爲阿爾及耳總督、乃一己之主意、致遭非難、墨斐過於干涉法屬北非政局亦被美國一部份報紙責爲謬誤、</p>
<p>里斯本二十六日同盟社電</p>

<p>瑞典京城二十六日海通社電</p>
<p>瑞典報紙駐英京特派員電稱、英政界人士對華盛頓會議頗多猜測、前傳會議後將由英美渝蘇組織協約國軍事會議之說、已經倫敦方面予以否認、彼等認爲蘇聯之外交政策不變、此一軍事會議即無成立之可能、華盛頓會議中所討論者、以北非問題爲主、故亦不妨逕稱之爲英·美會議、英·美更鑒於潛艇戰之危險、或擬另設應付潛艇戰術部、由諾貝爾海軍上將負責指揮、</p>
<p>季勞與特戈爾將簽軍事協定</p>
<p>瑞典京城廿六日海通社電</p>
<p>瑞典報紙息、倫敦關於華盛頓會議之官方文吿尙未發表、「新總彙日報」稱、英國人民自英國報紙駐美代表之報告中、皆知華盛頓會議之事實、倫敦消息靈通方面對協約國將來之合作表示樂觀、據倫敦「每日電聞報」稱、包括英·美·蘇與渝方代表之協約國軍事委員會、於數星期內將有重要之決定、該委員會與其他協約國保持密切之合作、討論軍事上政治上之重大事件、其中最先解决者爲北非問題、季勞與特戈爾將簽訂軍事協定、規定參加北非政治之各方人選、此外協約軍在地中海區域之最高司令問題、亦將由該委員會加以解決、美國陸軍參謀長馬歇爾有担任此職可能、</p>
<p>柏林二十六日海通社電　德外部根據報紙記載及私人來電、信邱吉爾現正在美國進行談話、惟渠是否將於歸途中赴莫斯科一行、以報吿在美談話之結果、則頗成問題、德外部認邱吉爾之再度赴美、其目的在求解決北非政局之紊亂、蓋英·美間對北非事件之齟齬達於極點、非邱吉爾親自赴美、與華盛頓方面傾心相談不可、故邱吉爾赴美之行、爲寬弛北非緊張局勢之措施、貝魯東被任爲阿爾及利亞新總督後、英·美在北非之不洽更爲加深、據德國外交界方面之意見、認邱吉爾與羅斯福所討論之另一問顯、爲英·蘇與美、蘇間之關係、　英外部最近對蘇聯之態度甚爲不安、良以蘇聯對協約國勝利後之計劃、默無一言、因此英·美當決定對蘇政策之共同方針、邇來協約國方面關於德國潛艇之威脅與協約國船隻之沉失、備極焦慮、故羅斯福邱吉爾之會談中、顯將論及應付德國潛艇之對策、此外英·美對南美洲國家政策之差異、亦在華盛頓會議討論之範圍內、德外部認邱吉兩企圖自美國獲得保證、使華盛頓在南美洲之勢力止於某種程度、惟以上所論之使命邱吉爾甚難達到其目的、</p>
<h3>突尼西亞西部　行政長官遇剌</h3>

<h3>德科學室發明　醫療凍斃方法</h3>

<h3>挪威海岸防務週密　英軍圖登陸未成　事後擗報英艇兩艘擊沉</h3>

<h3>德經濟部長　芬克演說</h3>
<p>柏林二十六日海通社電　德國經濟部長兼國家銀行總裁芬克、昨在德國學院發表演說、其題目爲「德國戰時經濟在精神上與物質上之基礎」、大意謂、德國尙有大量人力可供使用、極權國家之生產效率、非自由資本主義之國家所能望其項背、國社主義之戰時經濟所控制下之生產力、當視其中央之計劃與管理而定、德國若干工廠之合併與停閉、即依照此方針而進行、運輸與勞力之爲用、當以國家之利益爲前提、此可使德國在戰時生產之範疇內始終勝過敵方、德國與義國領導歐洲之經濟組織、已形成歐洲「生產力之集團」、德·義兩國間經濟之提携、其目的即在增加軸心國之經濟力、將來並擴而大之成爲世界貿易之基礎、歐洲命運之決定、並不在於德國與西歐之戰事、而在德國與蘇聯間之戰事、至與美洲則關係較淺、若德國與其同盟國不爲生存而作戰、殊難阻止歐洲之赤化、即美洲對此亦難忍受、但美國之猶太資本家與蘇聯之猶太共產黨竟沆瀣一氣、以相同之精神與目的、從事於此次世界戰事、</p>

<p>川省已有一百三十九縣市成立臨時參議會，合計參議　三千五百三十二人、其中男性佔三千三百九十八人，女性一百三十四人。</p>
<h3>日本修正內閣管制　加強首相職權</h3>
<p>日本內閣制度之缺陷，已成歷代內閣之通病，其缺陷之主要原因，厥爲閣僚之平等主義·因內閣總理大臣之地位，不過形式上爲內閣之首領，實際上並無權力指揮閣員，而保持國政之統一。根據憲法第五十五條第一款，總理大臣處於輔弼之立塲，在本質上與國務大臣不同。根據內閣官制第二條，第三條，雖有特別之地位與權限，然不能認爲得指揮或命令其他大臣。此點一向成爲未決之問題。自從政黨內閣結束，成爲舉國一體內閣之後，爲統一國政計，一致主張加强總理大臣之權限。</p>
<p>如修正內閣官制，加强內閣總理大臣之地位權限，以國務大臣之資格指揮命令其他大臣時，則與憲法上有抵　，但內閣總理大臣在行政大臣之立塲上，則地位優越於各省大臣，加以指示亦無不可。故立法上可以承認內閣總理大臣在行政方面，地位高於各省大臣。</p>
<p>昭和十四年阿部內閣時代，曾有：「統轄行使國家總動員法等項」之勅令，此舉即將關於國家總動員法之施行，集權於內閣總理大臣。規定舉凡國家總動員法之施行，各省大臣先須請示內閣總理大臣；內閣總理大臣關於施行國家總動員法，得直接指示各省大臣。上項勅令，即爲加强內閣總理大臣在行政方面權限之先例。今次戰時職權特例，亦可認爲因襲前例。主要問題，即爲首相能指示各省大臣，所調指示者，在法律上未可認爲有何適從，不過共有相當之拘束性。在目前即可認爲係承認總理大臣之指導地位。（任：譯自一月十丸日東京每日新聞。）</p>

<p>本埠大中聯煤公司迭向國內各產煤區大量辦貨、源源運滬、按期派給各同業應市、但該公司所派給各同業之烟白煤斤、均於事前呈准當局、訂定標準限價、故凡任何同業、如獲得該項派貨、槪須按照限價買賣、不得暗中越價、謀取牟利、因各同業所得派貨、均已給以台法之豐厚利潤、據昨日煤業方面消息、關於第八批煤斤派貨、本擬於日內正式配給、刻因各項手續、尙未完全辦妥、或將展延至農曆新年實行、至於此次所派煤斤種類、即爲焦作小子一種、適用於各大餅油條攤之燃燒、總計</p>

<h3>保富法（六）</h3>
<p>— 聶雲臺</p>
<p>天道是什麽？易經說的，一陰一陽之謂道。這陰陽不是虛玄的，一一都有事實可按。有日必有夜，有寒必有暑，有春夏就有秋冬，有潮漲就有潮落。山這些自然界的現象來觀察，一一都是一盈一虛，一消一長。從此推及人事，亦是如此。一盛一衰，一苦一樂，一憂一喜，一治一亂。但是天時的陰陽，有一定的標準，萬古不變；人事的盛衰，則隨人心的動向，變化無常。這種無常的變化，仍依着天道一陰一陽有定的標準發動出來。試說明如下：如人喜驕傲，定有忽然倒架子的時候到來。人喜懶惰安逸，定有極困苦的日子到來。人喜慳吝貪錢，定有嫖賭浪費之子孫替他破敗。人喜機巧計算，定有糊塗愚笨的子孫被人欺騙。這些變幻的人事，有智　的眼光的人自然能留心看得出來，曉得正是與日月起落寒暑往來一樣。天道是個太極圖，一半白一半黑中間有一個界限，過了這個界限，陰陽失去了平均，就要起變化叫做陽極則陰生，陰極則陽生。換句話說盛極必衰，消極必長，古來大聖哲的人洞明此理，所以敎人常須自己立在吃虧的地位，就是謙卑退讓，捨財不貧，克己利人，凡俗無見識的人，斷不肯做這種的吃虧的事。在新學家　要譏笑說，這是消極道德。不知道世界歷史一切偉大積極的事業，都是從這種消極道　的人做出來的。因爲消極克己，才能積極利人；捨財不貪，方能舉辦公衆利益；謙卑退護，格外令人尊敬欽佩，做事格外順利，容易成功。第一步似乎吃虧，第二步仍是得大便宜。淺見無識的人，止能看見一切事物的表面，不能看見對面。響如下棋一樣，止看得一着，看不到第二三着，不知世間事都是下棋，我動一着，對方就要應我一着，馬上就有第二三着跟着來。佛法說明一因一果感應之理，實係世界最高的科哲學。我把下棋來做醫喩，我們出一言，作一事，都是對人動了一着棋。我們出言做事時心中起的念頭，打的主意，就是對天公動了一着棋，一切人，一切生物，都是我們下棋的對手，我們對一隻狗表示好意，狗會對我搖搖尾親熱，若是惡聲對他，他就拖下尾巴走開。對人更不用說了，我謙和寬厚，人就感謝，驕傲刻薄，人就懷恨，這還是小對手。若是我們欺凌無能力的人物，或陰心　人，或用巧妙的手段佔便宜，使他們受了損害還不覺得，或藉着特別的地位，例如做官，做公司經理等職，暗中謀私人的利益。或是目已富厚，對於災難不肯救濟，自己家裏却是享用舒服。這些事衆人所無可奈何，法律也辦他不到，他算是棋贏了，他的對方棋都輸了，天道却不許他贏，會代替衆人做他的大對手，輕輕的動一着，叫他滿盤棋子都呆了，到底使他一敗塗地，這叫做人有千算，天止一算。我們日日係對人下棋，實　上係對天下棋，對人愈贏得大，就會對天輸得更利害。反過來講，若是對人肯讓鬆些，還處處幫他一着，使他們免得輸，我自己的棋也不會大輸，反而要對天贏一盤很大的棋。上述的范文正公是個最顯明的例，他本來極窮，做了將相幾十年，到死還沒有私人田產園宅，若從俗人看起來，他算是白忙了一世，然而對天卻贏了一大盤棋，子子孫孫貴盛賢才。其餘的耶律文正，林文忠，會文正幾位，都是肯輪棋，到後都贏了天公一盤大棋。那些會贏棋的許多人，發了幾十萬，幾百萬，幾千萬，幾萬萬，却是後來被天動一着就輸完了。古人說的：「人定勝天，天定亦能勝人」天定就是一定的天理。陰陽的定律是要平均，人們做的事過了分，就是失了平均。由於我們的心光達反陰陽的中和，所以起了反應，受到陰陽定律制裁，使還歸到平均的狀態。天公下棋不動心亦不動手，人們就自然幟了。譬如對墻壁拋皮球，球自然　拋過來，拋的力越大，球　的力亦更大，墻壁亦並未動手費力。所以書經說：「天作孽，猶可遠，自作孽，不可　。」孟子說。「出乎爾者，反乎爾者也。」意思就是自作業目受報，與佛經所說，自造因自結果，正是一樣。人定勝天，也不是眞疋勝了天，是說人照天的定理存心做事，究竟得　來的勝利，本來窮　，後得亨通，本來憂患，後得安　。這樣的勝利，仍是天理的勝利。我雖說善人對天贏　棋，實際也是天贏了，須知天道永不會輸的。</p>

<h3>日軍事發言人談　反攻緬甸問題　協約軍可自路進攻　惟意見紛岐難成實</h3>
<p>盟社本埠訊、日軍事發言人昨在招待報界席上、批評重慶加緊宣傳協約國攻勢、以圖收復緬甸事　、在印度之渝車或印軍、均無能力反攻緬甸日軍、協約軍取攻勢、除地理上之困難因素外、更須顧及在印之渝英美司令、對於進攻何方及何人擔任攻擊、意見　異發言人復形容重慶之希冀收復緬甸　路爲僅成夢幻、並詳述協約軍攻入緬甸之困難、及緬印邊陲之種種障碍、據稱、協約軍希望攻人緬甸有三條可能之路綫、一爲從印　經印緬邊陲進攻、二爲從雲南進攻、三爲出動大隊海軍攻擊緬甸西南部海岸、然緬印邊區對於協約軍有絕大困難、渝軍前從緬甸撤退時、必　備嘗天氣與地理上之艱難、茲渝軍苟欲再度入緬、必將復遇此等地理上之艱難、况雨季來臨、將使情況更爲惡劣、在印之渝軍實力計步兵三師、砲兵一旅、輜重兵一團、騎兵一營交　兵一旅及工兵　營、重慶極盼英軍從西方採取攻　、英美方面則願重慶從雲南進攻三軍司令對此點意見未能一致、雖迭次討論、尙無決定、此顯為該三盟國之主要問題、渝軍固無能力從雲南發動攻勢、反認日軍在緬甸之小規模肅淸戰、爲日軍進攻雲南之先聲云、</p>

<p>法租界霞飛等區、曾因各住戶店家內老鼠猖獗、由當局分發捕鼠籠子、發起捕鼠運動、頃自警方獲得消息、略謂此項捕鼠遝動、純屬欲鼓起居民對戶內老鼠加以注意、盡可能予以捕捉、前傳當局限定各戶每晚至少捕獲一隻、否則即將處以罰鍰之說、殊爲失實、蓋現時法租界衛生當局、雖竭力鼓動居民捕鼠、惟並未苛定每晚必須捕捉之數量云、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>談儉</h3>
<p>— 客觀</p>
<p>近來，大家都談節約。節約就是「儉」。我國人素以「儉」爲美德，聖賢經傳，常以此勉人。如巢查「格言聯璧」之類的書，關於「儉」的「嘉言」，可說「美不勝收」。</p>
<p>就我所讀過的關於談儉的文字，　算司馬光的「訓儉示康一一文，最令人滿意。根據他的淵博學識，他列舉喊史上偉人的節儉故事和因奢侈賈禍的人，而最値得記誦的一段，是：　「張文節爲相，自奉養如爲河陽掌書記時。所親或規之曰：「公今受俸不少，而自奉若此；公雖自信淸約，外人頗有公孫布被之譏。公宜少從衆。公嘆曰：「吾今日之俸，雖舉家錦衣玉食，何患患不能？顧人之常情，由儉入奢易，山奢入儉難。吾今日之俸，豈能常有？身豈能常存；一且異於今日，家人習奢已久，不能頓儉，必致失所。豈若吾居位，去位，身在，身亡常如一日乎？」嗚呼，大賢之深謀遠慮，豈庸人所及哉—」</p>
<p>接着，司馬光闡發「儉」的美德和「侈」的罪惡。他說：　「御孫曰：『儉，德之共也：侈，惡之大也。共，同也言有德者皆由儉來也，夫儉則寡欲；君子寡欲，則不役於物，可以直道而行；小人寡欲，則能謹身，節用，遠罪，豐家。故曰：儉，德之共也。侈則多欲：君子多欲，則貪慕富貴，枉道，速禍；小人多欲，則多求，妄用，喪身，敗家；是以居官必賄，居鄉必盜。故曰：侈，惡之大也。司馬光對子孫以儉爲訓，並非空口說白話，而是身體力行。不過，他的力行，並非沽名釣譽。所以他說：</p>
<p>「平生衣取蔽寒，食取充腹；亦不敢服垢敝以矯俗干名。但順吾性而已！</p>
<p>侈，固然要不得；但是，如果作僞，像「官塲現形記」所描寫的那樣，共僞儉」之惡，跟「侈」是半斤八兩了。</p>
<p>司馬光是反對王安石新政最力之一人。兩人政見儘管不同，可是道兩位偉人，都能以「儉」自持，都有其淸白的操守，純潔而崇高的人格。所以，在歷史上，兩人仍「各有千秋。」</p>
<h3>徵文錄取第三名　我今年約計劃</h3>
<p>— 袁鷹</p>
<p>在時代的磨錬裏訓練自己</p>
<p>提起計劃，使我慚愧，使我惶恐，也使我戰慄。</p>
<p>是去年的除夕，一位老敎師在我的紀念冊上寫着：「過去的一年過去了；你將如何度過下一年底短促的但也是悠長的歲月呢？「於是，爲了不辜負他底翻懷的好意，並且也替自己定下一條路，我，在今年的元且之晨，定下了一個計劃</p>
<p>可是，一年來，人事的栗碌，冷却了我底鼓舞了希望的熱烈的心，環境的動盪，更粉碎了我底所有的美滿約計劃；我不由自主地過着我所不願過的生活，讓道一年「短促的但也是悠長」的日子悄然地溜走。如果老敎師再來問我：「你如何度過這一年的呢？「我將不知如何回答，實在的，我自己也不知道怎樣在生活着。</p>
<p>目前，過去的讓它過去吧！我將如何利用這新的一年呢？正深深地打量着。</p>
<p>今年，—這新的一年，將是我的生命史上的一個段落，今年秋天，我將在生命史上開始寫出新的一頁。可是，爲了現行敎育制度的不良和腐敗，以及歷年來對於它的不斷增加的憎恨和不斷增加的厭倦，我不願意再將我的靑春的歲月和心血消耗在我所憎恨所厭倦的地方，而且，誰都知道，現在旣不是能够好好地讀書的時候，也不是能够好好地讀書的地方！爲什麽我還要將父親的血汗化費在沒有用處的地方呢？</p>
<p>「踏進社會去！」是我今年主要約計劃，雖然，這僅僅是希望而已。在目前的中國裏，社會和學校完全隔離在兩個世界裏，這中問沒有橋樑，沒有連繫，學校裏的一切，除了一張文慿以外，在社會上絲毫用不着，而社會上的一切，在學校裏又一些學不到，我爲什麼要消耗了無數的時間和金錢去死讀那些毫無實際用處的東西呢？我是活人，我要讀活的書籍，學活的知識！而社會就是我們眞正的學校，這學校裏正埋藏着無數的豐富的書籍和知識，我應當踏進這學校去。</p>
<p>自然，我也知道，這社會並不是一個良好的社會，正如個汚水池，充滿着無數的黑曙，無數的罪惡。我也知道，找尋這門戶是如何地困難，需要吹噓，需要虛僞，需要……，但這一切決不能阻礙我的步伐，我不逃避，也不畏縮，我將鼓舞起所有的勇氣，堅定了我的信心，大踏步地踏進社會去。</p>
<p>社會，有人說它是洪爐，有人說它是試金石，也有人說它是罪惡的淵藪：但無論是什麽，我總得要投身在它的角落裏，去觀察，去學習，甚至去暴露。</p>
<p>而從另一方面說起來，也是替生活重擔重重壓迫下的父親分一部份的担子。</p>
<p>另一個主要約計劃，就是更加努力地爲義校而工作，在上一年的下半年，這工作曾費去我大部份的時間和精力：可是，也只有這工作能鼓舞起我的熱情，能消除我的苦悶。雖然，工作是艱苦的；風雨的晚上，挾着一大堆的本子，在泥濘的路上蹣跚地移動着疲乏的脚步：西北風搖撼着窗門的夜裏，爲了批改卷子，常工作到夜深人靜的時候；……但道一切都只有增加我的愉快，我的安慰，在這動盪的時代裏？我究竟已替社會盡一點些微的義務，獻出一些些微的力量；和某一部份人比起來，我該値得驕傲的！</p>
<p>因此，在今年，只要學校能繼續下去，我也仍將繼續地獻出我的些微的力量，爲了孩子，爲了社會，爲了祖國，也爲了人類！</p>
<p>暑假裏，如果沒有特別的事發生，我將繼續將我底第一個創作寫下去，直到完成它。</p>
<p>爲了許多好的題材和許多典型人物深刻的印象在腦海裏活動了好久，我也計劃着再寫幾個短篇，通過形象化的藝術手法，將這些熟悉的人物和事物直立起來。</p>
<p>如果要統括地說一句：我今年約計劃，就是：學習！工作！寫作！—但主要的還是學習和工作。</p>
<p>這時代是偉大的磨鍊，這社會也是偉大的熔爐，今年，我將開始投入這熔爐的深處，在時代的磨鍊裏訓練自己，充實自己，堅强自己。</p>
<p>穆勒說：『與其不能完全照自己約計劃做而灰心，不如因爲看見約計劃有一小部分能够實現，而心裏喜歡？而勇氣百倍。」</p>
<p>我知道，今年的歲月，將依舊在忽忽裏消失了它的影子，只有「短促」，不會「悠長」，且待今年的除夕之夜，人們在忙着想明年的新計劃的時候，讓我再來檢討自己如何度過道一年底短促的歲月　！　（按袁鷹君年十八歲，南光中學高中三年級肄業，任揚光義務學校敎員。）</p>
<h3>傻人傻事</h3>
<p>— 陳碧芸</p>
<p>好久不見的雪華，忽然像一陣風般，吹到了我的家裏，我熱烈地歡迎着她。我說，湯小姐，你成名了，是不是要緊趕到上海來看看那些登載着你的大作的刋物？</p>
<p>她面孔一扳，怪我爲什麼這樣客氣。接着她說，來看看上海的刋物，的確也是此來的目的之一，然而最大的目的，卻是聽了一個傻人的傻事，也想來同傻一下。她這樣說，我當然弄得不懂，要緊問其究竟。</p>
<p>據雪華說，她是到愚園路「集英」中小學來當敎員的。她一說起「集英」，我運忙跳起來說，那就是我的三個孩子讀書的學校，我曾去過，你能來敎書，那就再好也沒有了。但不知你所說的傻，傻在那裏。</p>
<p>她說，該校的方校長，便是傻人，她做了一些傻事。她不願意安坐着當少奶奶，一定要找事情做。她又不願意做賺錢的事情，例如囤貨或從事其他的生意，却要開學校。開了學校，她更不想賺一個錢，所收進的學雜費，旣然特別少，並不有一些剝削，甚至還可以免掉或减少，而所付出的薪資及其他費用，卻又不打一些七折八扣的算盤，應付的總是付。因此她不但賺不到錢，並且在半年之內，賠上了一萬五千元。道些錢都是她去向朋友借來的，有的朋友固然相當贊成她，有的却就　她爲傻人，稱她的辦學校爲傻事。…</p>
<p>我聽了這些話，不免脫口說，眞的麽？因爲半年以來，我只注意着孩子們功課的進步，該校共他的事情，我早已不去注意了。</p>
<p>雪華一本正經　說，要不眞是，如此，她還來麽！她在鄕間不安靜些，何必來這烟塵漲天的上海討生活，何况她的身體又不好！</p>
<p>我說，校址倒是很淸幽的，大槪只會與你的健康有益，不會有害。她說，對的，這樣，才不至將她那多病的身體，傻得過了度。她又吿訴我，校舍問題巳完全解決，可以多開幾個敎室，所有的新舊同事，幾乎全是優秀的女敎師，和她很合得來，所以她想，她的傻，老遠的跑來，並不爲了別的，只想也能够做一些直接有益於社會的事情，總算也獲得了相當的安慰。</p>
<p>雪華去了以後，我的確爲了她的話，發生了好些感想。社會上究竟有多少傻人傻事呢？大家都傻，各事都傻，將要成爲一個怎樣的社會？反過來，什麼都不傻，都取巧，都自私圖利，又將成爲一個怎樣的社會？…</p>
<p>我有些想不下去，只好寫出來請大家想想。（酬移助學金）</p>
<h3>萬世師表</h3>
<p>— James　Hiltno著　依今譯</p>
<p>（九）</p>
<p>不管他對於布爾人怎樣地別有所見，他對於勞合喬治（Lloyd　George）和那著名的「預算」，却和別人一樣，有着正統的觀念。他並不注意這二者之一。若干年後，勞合·喬治在勃洛克菲爾德演講日（Spcech　Day）來作貴賓，吉普斯被引見，那時候，他對他說：『勞合·喬治先生，我差不多老透了—呃哼—還記得你年輕的樣子，並且—呃哼—我承認，在我看來，你似乎—呃哼—已經進步了—呃哼—許多。」校長立在他們旁邊，很有些愕然；可是勞合·喬治熱誠地笑着，在接着舉行的儀式中，，對吉斯比對了任何別人都談得多。</p>
<p>『恰正像吉普斯，」後來有人批評着。「他可以行所無事。我想，到了這樣年齡，不論你對誰說什麼話，都是對的……』</p>
<p>繼威澤培的校長之任的是老美爾德倫（Meldum），他做了三十年校長，在一九〇林年，突因肺炎而逝世；在繼任者被委任出來的以前，吉普斯成了勃洛克菲爾德的代理校長。只有些微的機會，校董們也許會將他的暫時代理改爲永久委任；但是當校董們委任一個三十七歲的年輕人來時，吉普斯並不眞正失望，此人身上的獎章發着光彩，只要將眉毛彈一彈，就可以使大堂裏肅靜起來，其爲人如何，可見一斑。吉普斯不能和這種人競爭；他從來沒有，也永不會和這種人競爭，這是他知道的。他徹頭徹尾是一個較爲溫和而不大兇很的動物。</p>
<p>他是在一九一三年辭職的，在辭職以前的那些年中，充滿了記憶得很淸楚的圖畫（二二）社會服務</p>

<h3>On the Youth Movement</h3>
<p>Youth is the morning sun, is spring, is the roaring tide, possessing boundless radiance, warmth, vitality, and future prospects. This is speaking from the perspective of youth itself. Youth is the lifeblood of the nation, the pillars of society, and the masters of the future destiny of mankind. This is speaking from the perspective of youth's position in the nation, society, and among mankind. Because youth has these characteristics, the era of youth is an era worth singing about, worth weeping for, worth revering, and worth going mad for. Other countries aside, just speaking of our own country, from ancient times to the present, countless youths have gloriously struggled for the sake of the nation, for the sake of society, and for the destiny of all mankind, causing many middle-aged people to feel ashamed and older people to sigh with admiration.</p>
<p>Presently, China is situated in a new era. In this new era, can it do without the participation of young people? No, it cannot. Can we engage in empty talk about the youth movement while being detached from reality? No, we cannot. The present is an era that requires the revitalization of the youth movement. However, the first question is, who do we hope will lead the youth movement? We believe that the leaders of the youth movement must have their own minds and bodies that are pure and flawless, must have words and actions that are completely consistent and can serve as a model for young people, must possess a noble and pure character, must have correct thoughts, and must be able to thoroughly understand the psychology and aspirations of modern Chinese youth, and be people who can strive to satisfy the normal desires of modern Chinese youth.</p>
<p>Secondly, given the arduousness of the current era and the protracted nature of the war, the government authorities should have a comprehensive policy for the youth movement. This policy must be tailored to China's history, China's social realities, and the common psychology of Chinese youth; otherwise, blindly copying foreign youth movement systems and blindly imitating foreign youth movement policies will inevitably result in "exerting effort without gaining favor." The disastrous failure of the youth movement in Chongqing over the past six years is precisely because it disregarded the national conditions and blindly copied foreign models. It is especially worth mentioning here that we must absolutely reverse the special agent system implemented by the Chongqing regime, which has ruined the youth movement. This special agent system has sacrificed countless innocent and pure youths and has destroyed countless amiable, lovable, promising, and capable young cadres for the nation and society. At the same time, it has also created opportunities for the Communist Party. Again, the authorities should treat the youth with a compassionate and nurturing heart, viewing each youth as their own children. Even if the children go down the wrong path, or unfortunately go down the wrong path due to motives of loving the country and loving society, they should use methods of persuasion and guidance, and use a compassionate and faithful attitude, to influence them, to move them. We can say that there is absolutely no incorrigible and unfilial person who cannot be sincerely moved. On the part of the youth themselves, in the current new era, first of all, they should oppose pessimistic and disappointed sentiments toward the nation, the ethnicity, and the youth movement. They should oppose the words and actions of generally wanting to be peaceful civilians and losing the attitude that they should have in wartime. They should even more oppose being dejected and corrupt. The atmosphere of "gathering together all day long, without speaking of righteousness" is precisely the most dangerous phenomenon currently. Here, on the one hand, we hope that the authorities will use an open and magnanimous attitude and a compassionate and gentle method to do their best to dispel the dark clouds in front of the youth; on the other hand, we even more hope that the youth themselves will recognize reality, grasp the correct outlook on life, and intensify their studies and self-cultivation without the slightest relaxation.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Continues in the Don Region, German Forces Continue to Batter Stalingrad, Combat Situation is Quite Intense</h3>
<p>German Headquarters, 26th, Havas News Agency - This afternoon, the German military bulletin stated that fighting with Soviet troops in many parts of Eastern Europe has intensified. Although German troops are outnumbered, the enemy still has no opportunity to exploit. In Stalingrad, a small unit of Croatian troops, along with German troops, are concentrated in the central and southern parts of the city. German aircraft are assisting in the battle, and the combat situation is extremely difficult. In the Kupensk and Manik areas, Soviet troops were repelled after fierce fighting. To shorten the front lines, German troops withdrew to predetermined positions. German armored and mechanized units in the Manik area continued their offensive and were quite successful. The enemy forces retreated to the northeast. Fierce fighting continues in the Don region. Enemy forces southwest of Voronezh launched another attack and were mostly repelled, suffering considerable losses and heavy casualties. Soviet forces southwest of Rzhev and Velikiye Luki attempted an attack but were unsuccessful. Although the Soviet offensive south of Lake Ladoga was covered by tanks, it still did not achieve its desired outcome.</p>
<p>Moscow, 26th, Reuter - Last night's special communique from the Soviet Information Bureau stated that Soviet troops have recaptured the city of Voronezh on the upper Don River.</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th, Havas News Agency - Although the Soviet offensive south of Lake Ilmen is fierce, it has not achieved any major breakthroughs. Fighting in the central sector of the Eastern Front is also only of a local nature. However, the fighting between Voronezh and the Black Sea is the most intense, and it is impossible to predict when it will weaken. The German counter-offensive and the harsh weather have thwarted the Soviet offensive, but the Soviet forces are still trying to attack, hoping to break through the German lines. The German forces are now adopting a strategy of shortening the front lines and conducting mobile warfare. One week ago, the southern sector of the Eastern Front held by German troops extended from Voronezh in the north to the Terek River in the south. In order to concentrate their forces and avoid the risk of being attacked on the flanks, the German forces began to shorten the front lines. The fighting between the Donets and Don rivers is now concentrated in a few key strongholds. Soviet forces once penetrated the German lines but were immediately annihilated by our troops. Soviet forces are also very active in the lower Don River, and their motorized units were advancing westward when they were cut off by German troops. Some were destroyed by German troops, and some were forced to retreat. German troops are making progress in operations in the Manych Steppe. German troops in the Kupensk area were shifting their positions westward, but the Soviet forces still did not dare to advance lightly. In the mountainous areas of the western Caucasus, the Soviet forces recently concentrated five divisions, attempting to break through our lines, but were defeated by a fierce resistance from the German and Slovak allied forces. Although the Soviet forces have penetrated the German lines in several places in the Stalingrad area, and although German supplies are difficult, the morale of the soldiers remains as firm as ever.</p>
<p>General Dittmar Broadcasts Praise for the German Sixth Army</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th, Havas News Agency - General Dittmar gave a radio broadcast here, stating that the German Sixth Army is bravely fighting in Stalingrad and has a major impact on the Soviet offensive in the southern sector of the Eastern Front. If General Paulus were to abandon Stalingrad, the Soviet forces would use the transportation lines leading southwest and west through Stalingrad. The German defense of Stalingrad prevents the Soviet forces from attacking Rostov from the lower Don River, thereby cutting off the connection between Ukraine and the Caucasus. The heroic resistance of the German troops has given the German command ample time to plan countermeasures. Although the Soviet forces have occupied some territory, their economic position is still not secure. The Soviet forces will likely continue their offensive, but the opportunities for the German troops have already increased.</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th, Havas News Agency - The German newspapers here unanimously praised the heroic resistance of the German troops in the Stalingrad area last night and revealed that the German Sixth Army and two Romanian divisions in the Stalingrad area are in a serious situation. The current defensive strategy adopted by the German troops is aimed at containing the progress of the Soviet forces. The pressure on Stalingrad is the greatest in all sectors of the Eastern Front today. The heroic resistance of the German soldiers there is the greatest achievement, which will not only be praised by contemporaries, but will also be immortalized in future generations.</p>

<h3>Military Preparations of the National Government Over the Past Three Years: A General Overview</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th, Domei News Agency - The current issue of the "Weekly Official Gazette" published an article released by the Japanese Army Press Department, revealing that the Nanjing National Government has built a large army and fleet in the past three years, including 16 warships, 36 gunboats, and 6 survey ships. The army includes 42 divisions, 5 independent brigades, and 12 independent corps. There are 12 group armies and 8 corps in North China, all with modern equipment, fully assisting the Japanese army in suppressing bandits and maintaining order. A total of 20 divisions, 6 independent brigades, and 3 independent corps, totaling over 200,000 men, of Chongqing's troops have defected to the National Government, as well as over 50,000 men in North China. The entire army has recently been reorganized, with one-third of the independent brigades forming security forces, and other restructuring measures have been implemented simultaneously. In the aviation field, an aviation school has been established in Changzhou to rebuild the army air force as much as possible.</p>

<h3>Rommel Arrives in Mareth, Concentrates Troops to Establish Defenses and Hold Firm, Fierce Fighting Reported in the Ossetia River Basin, Germans Occupy Jebel Boudabbous Mountains</h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th, Havas News Agency -</p>
<p>Military sources have recently stated that General Rommel's troops, although subjected to continuous bombing by British aircraft in the area bordering Libya and Tunisia, have avoided contact with enemy forces with minimal losses and have crossed the Tunisian border. All motorized units and infantry are safe and sound. General Rommel is currently concentrating his forces in Mareth (70 miles from the Tunisian border). It is expected that the German forces will hold this area and maintain it for a long time.</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th, Havas News Agency - Rommel's Axis forces in Tunisia are now free from enemy resistance, as Montgomery himself admits. When the German-Italian allied forces withdrew to the northwest on January 24 and 25, Montgomery missed the opportunity to attack the flanks of the German-Italian allied forces from the south. Montgomery's attacks on the flanks of the Axis forces have been ongoing for three weeks, but have not been realized. This shows that the British military operations have not been commanded as desired. The British offensive has also been thwarted. The British vanguard had contact with the Axis forces some time ago, but failed. It seems that the British must first adjust their supply bases, reorganize their troops, and then talk about war again. The Axis forces have the advantage of terrain and can wait for the enemy to exhaust themselves. At the same time, the strength of the Axis forces in Tunisia is growing daily, the supply problem has also been solved, and the key points of Tunisia are under the control of the Axis forces, so the enemy forces will not be able to succeed again.</p>
<p>Rome, 26th, Havas News Agency - This afternoon's Italian military bulletin stated that between January 19 and 24, the Axis forces in Tunisia captured 4,000 enemy soldiers, seized or destroyed 13 enemy tanks, 70 cannons, approximately 200 vehicles, approximately 100 machine guns, and countless other war materials. West of Tripoli, there were only skirmishes yesterday. Enemy troops attacking Tunisia were repelled and eight armored vehicles were destroyed. German aircraft shot down four enemy aircraft, and anti-aircraft guns shot down one enemy aircraft. A British aircraft shot down in Bacinono on the evening of January 22 has been found to have crashed into the sea. Enemy aircraft attacked Avola and Amabiliema, causing minor ground damage. In the Mediterranean, an Italian submarine sank an 18,000-ton transport ship under enemy escort.</p>
<p>Swiss Capital, 25th, Havas News Agency - According to sources from the Axis and British-American sides, fierce fighting continued in the Ossetia River basin in Tunisia yesterday. The Allied Headquarters in North Africa issued a war report stating that the German offensive in the area has stopped, but the German forces have occupied the Jebel Boudabbous Mountains. British and American aircraft bombed the port of Bizerte yesterday. The French Dissident Headquarters also issued a war report stating that General Leclerc's troops, starting from north of Lake Chad, have reached the Jebel Mefou Mountains. French troops are also fighting in the Gafsa area in southern Tunisia, which is becoming increasingly important as it will be the place where the Axis forces will link up their left and right flanks. However, according to news from Berlin and Rome, there were only local battles yesterday, and the Axis forces achieved some success, capturing many prisoners and occupying several strategically important locations. German aircraft continued to bomb Allied communication lines and shipping along the coast of Algeria.</p>
<p>Swedish Capital, 26th, Havas News Agency - London dispatches report that political figures in the British capital are quite disappointed with the slow progress of the Tunisian war and the failure of the British Eighth Army to pursue the German-Italian allied forces. Newspapers are also critical. The military correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph" wrote that it is a mistake to say that General Rommel's forces are weak and cannot hold the so-called Mareth Line. The well-known British military commentator Liddell Hart also stated in the "Daily Mail" that Montgomery's failure to cut off General Rommel's troops should not be excused by the British War Office. If Britain could have used trained paratroopers and transport aircraft in time, Montgomery could have found a way to land behind the German and Italian forces and surround them. Based on the experience gained in North Africa, it is difficult for us to transfer the war to Western Europe.</p>
<h3>US Food Production Declines, Strict Rationing to be Implemented, General Price Index All Increase</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 26th, Central News Agency - According to dispatches from Washington, US Food Commissioner Wickard and Manpower Commissioner McNutt jointly met with reporters on the 25th and issued a warning on the issue of rural labor supply. They stated that there are still three million people in the United States engaged in unnecessary work, and these personnel must be sent to rural areas before the agricultural season this summer. The food problem is extremely serious, and if the rural labor supply fails this year, a major crisis will occur in the future.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 25th, Havas News Agency -</p>
<p>Washington dispatches report that, according to the Department of Agriculture, the United States will strictly implement food rationing in the near future, and that food production in 1942 decreased by approximately 13 percent compared to the previous year. In addition, food must be provided to Britain and other Allied countries, so the food situation is not optimistic.</p>
<p>Argentine Capital, 26th, Havas News Agency - Washington dispatches report that US Agriculture Secretary Wickard declared in his annual report that the United States will take stricter measures to restrict food in the near future, even if the 1943 harvest is bountiful, this measure may not be avoided. The US government needs 50 percent of the food in 1943 to supply the military and transport it to countries where the United States provides food under the Lend-Lease Act.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 25th, Havas News Agency -</p>
<p>According to news from New York, US prices increased by an average of 10 percent last year, but food increased by 20 percent. The general price index increased from 93.2 to 101 between December of the previous year and December of last year, while the food price index increased from 92.6 to 108.3. This has once again sparked discussions about the crisis of inflation in the United States.</p>

<h3>Indian Residents Everywhere Gather to Commemorate Declaration of Independence</h3>

Chairman Bose delivered a speech, saying that the Indian independence movement has reached its final stage. Although our noble leaders such as Acharya and Nehru have been imprisoned by the British, tens of thousands of our patriots have risen to participate in the struggle against Britain.

The meeting was hosted by the Yokohama branch of the Indian Independence League.</p>
<h3>Finnish Political Leaders Visit Sweden</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 26th (Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>Local newspapers hold a reserved attitude towards the visit of Finnish cabinet members and leaders of the Finnish Social Democratic Party to Sweden over the weekend. Apart from rumors, nothing has been revealed about the purpose of this visit. The Swedish people are very concerned about the fate of Finland, especially in recent times. Great attention is being paid here to the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Finland. The upcoming Finnish presidential election is also a topic of discussion here. Sweden also attaches great importance to the situation on the Eastern Front, as increased Soviet pressure on Finland also increases the threat to Sweden from the East.</p>
<h3>The US and Britain, Under the Deadlock in North Africa, Attempt to Stir Up Trouble Again in the Balkans to Reverse the Current Declining Trend in North Africa</h3>
<p>The North African campaign, which the United States and Britain have been clamoring about, is no longer as powerful as it once was. More than two months have passed since the landings, and on the one hand, it has suffered fierce counterattacks from the Axis forces, causing two major setbacks. At the same time, within their own line, there was the assassination of Darlan, and the antagonism between Giraud and de Gaulle, fighting each other, revealing their ugly state. In order to make up for this failure, the United States and Britain have had to work hard to reinvigorate themselves and attempt to reverse the declining trend in other areas, so they are seeking new battlefields in the Eastern Mediterranean and West Asia, and presenting signs of their stirrings. What is the truth? It is something the world is eager to know. This newspaper has made a special international long-distance call to inquire about Special Correspondent Enomoto, to hear his report. Mr. Enomoto has been stationed in Turkey for many years and has recently traveled to Berlin to investigate the new situation in the Balkans.</p>
<p>This newspaper reports that according to recent foreign telegrams, it is widely rumored that US troops have landed on Cyprus, that riots have occurred in Iran, that the feelings of the people in West Asia towards the British and American forces have deteriorated, that British, American and Soviet diplomacy surrounding Turkey is very active, that the German army is strengthening the defenses of Crete and the Aegean Islands, and that the Bulgarian Army Chief's visit to Germany following the De Ro summit, and other events in West Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean, give people a sense of unpredictability. Regarding these various matters, we would like to have a comprehensive report, and now we ask you to first describe the dynamics in West Asia.</p>
<p>Enomoto: The most noteworthy aspect of the recent situation in West Asia is the increasingly active military advance of the United States. Currently, from Palestine to Syria, Iraq, and Iran, the strength of the US military is estimated to be around 60,000 to 80,000, with approximately 400 aircraft. It is reported that the US side has drafted a plan to increase its forces to 250,000 by the end of March this year. In addition, there are also British and allied Polish, Greek, and Yugoslav troops, so the total strength of the British and American forces in West Asia is currently estimated to be between 200,000 and 250,000. If the US reinforcement plan can be realized as scheduled, then by the end of March, the total strength of the British and American forces will reach 400,000. Currently, US air force bomber squadrons, British commando units, and Greek troops are concentrated on Cyprus, preparing for a counter-offensive in Southeast Europe. The British and American plan seems to be aimed at instigating strikes and riots in the Balkan countries in March and April, in order to disrupt the Axis's rear lines in the Balkans, while the troops gathered in West Asia will first attack Cyprus and the Dodecanese Islands in coordination, following the example of the previous Great War, to attempt a landing operation in Thessaloniki. In Turkey, the British and Americans have also opened up many of the borders between Turkey and Syria, as well as the Aegean coast of Thrace, and have introduced many British, American, Australian, and New Zealand troops, engaging in the construction of airfields, trenches, barracks, and roads.</p>
<p>This newspaper: It is widely rumored that there are food riots in Iran, which shows that the feelings of the Iranian people towards the British and American forces seem to have deteriorated considerably.</p>
<p>Enomoto: There are two accounts regarding the food riots in Iran. Although the British, Americans, and Soviets deliberately exaggerated the food panic in Iran, according to information from travelers who have actually inspected the recent situation in Iran, the food situation in Iran is not as bad as they claim. The story of the food riots is nothing more than a strategic propaganda by the British, Americans, and Soviets using the name of internal unrest in Iran to expand their occupied territories. Iraq, which has already declared war on the Axis powers, seems to have joined the war as a result of the regent of the Nuri al-Said puppet regime, Abdul-Ilah, visiting Cairo at the end of December last year and reaching an agreement with the American forces in West Asia under Alexander. It is reported that the conditions for Iraq's participation in the war are to join the Atlantic Charter, guarantee independence after the war, and have a say in the postwar period. However, from the British and American perspective, the main purpose is to first summon approximately three Iraqi divisions to serve as coolies for the British and American forces in West Asia and to completely occupy Iraq's military bases. As a result of the participation in the war, the anti-British sentiment of the Iraqi people has been strengthened. (Ding: Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, January 19)</p>

It is said that the Chongqing authorities have stipulated that all students of conscription age must be called up for service. According to the "Conscription Office," students who are 18 years old should be enlisted immediately and that starting from January of the 32nd year of the Republic, lots will be drawn and those selected will be conscripted in order of selection. Service assignments will be based on their level of education. As for the method of conscription, the principle is that students are conscripted based on their place of origin. However, if their families have permanently moved to another location, they will be conscripted there. After students draw lots, those who have completed elementary school or junior high school will not be conscripted. Those who have completed senior high school, vocational school, or university and are less than one year away from graduation will be allowed to postpone their enlistment until after graduation. Regarding the length of student service, it is stipulated that those who have served for two years will be allowed to return to school. Those who have obtained the qualifications of reserve sergeants will have their service reduced to one year and six months, and those who have obtained the qualifications of reserve officer candidates will have their service reduced to one year. It is planned that the length of service will not be extended during wartime. To encourage teachers, it is planned to reduce the length of service for normal school students to one year. After students are conscripted, they will be assigned to officer corps, army and air force academies, training teams, student teams, model teams, mechanized units, military police regiments, artillery and engineering units, communications units, etc., or serve in military political, administrative, transportation, and military medical work, depending on their level of education and aspirations.</p>
<h3>Washington Holds Consecutive Meetings to Discuss Dealing with the War Situation. General Marshall May be Appointed Commander of the Allied Forces in the European Theater. A Department to Deal with Submarine Tactics is Also Planned.</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>According to reports from London, British newspapers yesterday speculated that U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall might be appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Allied forces in the European theater. The Washington dispatch of the London Daily Mail said that according to the opinions of some "deep observers" in Washington, General Marshall will be appointed as the commander of the Allied forces in Europe. The London News Chronicle also carried unconfirmed news from Washington that General Eisenhower might be replaced by General Marshall. After the establishment of the North African puppet regime, General Eisenhower and Murphey, the representative of the U.S. State Department, were criticized by the American and British public. The public believed that Eisenhower's choice of the former French Interior Minister Peton as the governor of Algiers was his own idea, and was therefore criticized. Some American newspapers also criticized Murphey for interfering too much in the political situation in French North Africa as a mistake.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>According to reports from Washington, representatives from the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing are holding daily meetings there to discuss ways to deal with the two major threats. The so-called two major threats are the Axis submarine warfare and the internal strife in the political situation in French North Africa. Sources close to the U.S. government said that, according to estimates by experts in Washington, the submarine threat causes the Allied side to lose one million tons of ships per month. How to concentrate ships to supply each war zone and how to step up shipbuilding are being discussed. The second issue proves that the North African campaign has exposed the fragility of the Allied diplomatic and political relations beyond expectations. U.S. Secretary of State Hull recently declined to comment on whether there has been any progress in the dispute between de Gaulle and Giraud, which shows that this matter occupies an important position in international negotiations. According to Macmillan, the situation in North Africa is a version of other similar situations, which can occur at any time and urgently needs to be fundamentally resolved.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>According to news from Washington, the U.S. Secretary of State said yesterday at an intelligence conference that the Allied countries are currently considering unifying the Allied war strategy. Political circles believe that the Allied countries will appoint a commander in charge of the Mediterranean war, or will merge the headquarters of General Eisenhower, the commander of the Allied forces in North Africa, and General Alexander, the commander of the British forces in the Near East.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 26th (Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>A correspondent from Swedish newspapers stationed in London reported that British politicians have many speculations about the Washington Conference. The previous rumor that the Allied countries would form an Allied military conference composed of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing after the conference has been denied by London. They believe that without a change in Soviet foreign policy, it is impossible for this military conference to be established. The main topic discussed at the Washington Conference was the North African issue, so it might as well be called the British-American Conference. The United States and Britain, in view of the danger of submarine warfare, may also set up a department to deal with submarine tactics, under the command of Admiral Nobel.</p>
<p>Giraud and de Gaulle Will Sign Military Agreement</p>
<p>Stockholm, 26th (Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>Swedish newspapers report that the official communique of the London Washington Conference has not yet been released. The "New General Daily" said that the British people know the facts of the Washington Conference from the reports of British newspaper representatives stationed in the United States. Informed sources in London are optimistic about the future cooperation of the Allied countries. According to the London "Daily Telegraph," the Allied Military Committee, including representatives from Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing, will make important decisions within a few weeks. The committee maintains close cooperation with other Allied countries and discusses major military and political events. The first issue to be resolved is the North African issue. Giraud and de Gaulle will sign a military agreement stipulating the candidates to participate in North African politics. In addition, the issue of the supreme commander of the Allied forces in the Mediterranean region will also be resolved by the committee. U.S. Army Chief of Staff Marshall may take this position.</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Haitong News Agency) The German Foreign Ministry, based on newspaper reports and private telegrams, believes that Churchill is currently holding talks in the United States. However, whether he will go to Moscow on his way back to report the results of the talks in the United States is questionable. The German Foreign Ministry believes that Churchill's second trip to the United States is aimed at resolving the chaos in the North African political situation. The discord between Britain and the United States over the North African issue has reached its extreme, and it is necessary for Churchill to go to the United States in person to have a heart-to-heart talk with Washington. Therefore, Churchill's trip to the United States is a measure to ease the tense situation in North Africa. After Peton was appointed as the new Governor of Algeria, the discord between Britain and the United States in North Africa was further deepened. According to the opinion of German diplomatic circles, another issue discussed by Churchill and Roosevelt is the relationship between Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States, and the Soviet Union. The British Foreign Ministry has recently been very uneasy about the Soviet Union's attitude, because the Soviet Union has not said a word about the plan after the Allied victory. Therefore, Britain and the United States should decide on a common policy towards the Soviet Union. Recently, the Allied countries have been extremely anxious about the threat of German submarines and the sinking of Allied ships. Therefore, the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting will obviously discuss countermeasures to deal with German submarines. In addition, the differences between British and American policies towards South American countries are also within the scope of the Washington Conference's discussions. The German Foreign Ministry believes that Churchill is trying to obtain guarantees from the United States to limit Washington's power in South America to a certain extent. However, it is very difficult for Churchill to achieve his goals with the above-mentioned missions.</p>
<h3>Administrative Governor of Western Tunisia Assassinated</h3>
<p>Rome, 26th (Haitong News Agency) It has been learned here that Gadaore, who previously had considerable influence in western Tunisia, was appointed as the administrative governor of western Tunisia by General Eisenhower, but has now been assassinated by Arab nationalist activists. Gadaore was considered a traitor in the eyes of the people of western Tunisia.</p>
<h3>German Scientific Laboratory Discovers Method for Treating Freezing Deaths</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Haitong News Agency) A German scientific laboratory has recently discovered a method to prevent freezing deaths. The results obtained from animal experiments are very satisfactory. In the past, it was not clear what caused death from severe cold. Now, after German scientists have experimented, it is known that the cause of freezing death is lack of oxygen at low temperatures, which causes the blood pigment in the body to stiffen. Therefore, the old method of using hot water to revive frozen people can now be replaced with short-wave therapy, which is more effective. Germany is now adopting this new treatment method, which has been very effective. The mortality rate has been reduced from 78% to 35%.</p>
<h3>Norwegian Coastal Defenses Are Well-Prepared, British Troops Attempt to Land Without Success. Afterwards, Reports Claim Two British Vessels Sunk.</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Haitong News Agency) Haitong News Agency learned from responsible sources here last night that seven British motor torpedo boats attempted to break through the Norwegian coast on Saturday night in order to land their demolition troops near the town of Reinvik. However, the British ships were repelled by the German coastal defense forces and patrol boats before reaching the Norwegian coast. At that time, the results of the battle could not be observed due to poor visibility. However, according to a subsequent report from the aircraft, only five British ships returned to their country. From this, it can be seen that one British torpedo boat has been sacrificed in this battle.</p>
<h3>German Economic Minister Funk Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Haitong News Agency) German Economic Minister and National Bank President Funk delivered a speech at the German Academy yesterday, entitled "The Spiritual and Material Foundations of the German Wartime Economy." The main idea was that Germany still has a large amount of manpower available for use, and that the production efficiency of totalitarian countries cannot be compared with that of free capitalist countries. The productivity under the control of the National Socialist wartime economy depends on its central planning and management. The merger and closure of some German factories is carried out in accordance with this policy. The use of transportation and labor must be based on the interests of the country. This can enable Germany to always outperform the enemy in the scope of wartime production. Germany and Italy's leadership of the European economic organization has formed a European "productivity group." The economic cooperation between Germany and Italy is aimed at increasing the economic power of the Axis countries and will be expanded into the basis of world trade in the future. The decision of Europe's fate does not lie in the war between Germany and Western Europe, but in the war between Germany and the Soviet Union, which has little to do with the Americas. If Germany and its allies do not fight for survival, it will be difficult to prevent the communization of Europe, which is also difficult for the Americas to tolerate. However, the Jewish capitalists of the United States and the Jewish Communists of the Soviet Union have colluded with each other, engaging in this world war with the same spirit and purpose.</p>
<h3>Australian Wartime Cabinet Continues to Meet</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from Canberra, the Australian government convened a wartime cabinet meeting on the 25th under the personal supervision of Prime Minister Curtin to hold important consultations on domestic and foreign policies. The content of the cabinet meeting is highly confidential and has not been released. The meeting continued on the 26th, and all cabinet members attended. After the cabinet meeting, Curtin delivered a broadcast speech to Australia, Britain, and the United States. The Australian Parliament is scheduled to meet on the 27th, and there are many important proposals to be discussed, such as supplementary budget proposals, which urgently need to be resolved. The Labor Party internally opposes Curtin's war policies, so it is expected that the current cabinet has encountered a major crisis. In addition, the Labor Party also held a party congress on the 26th, and other opposition parties held congresses at the same time to increase their momentum.</p>
<h3>New Building of Japanese Embassy in Germany Completed, German Deputy Foreign Minister Transfers Building</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency Berlin, 26th The new building of the Japanese Embassy in Germany was handed over to Japanese Ambassador General Oshima yesterday afternoon. The building is located in the center of the Berlin embassy district on Tiergartenstrasse and was designed by famous German architects. It is made of marble and good wood, and the interior decoration is very exquisite. At the handover ceremony yesterday, the German representative told Ambassador Oshima that the German side had exhausted its efforts in the construction of the building to make the residence of friendly Japan comfortable. German Deputy Foreign Minister Hullmann, representing Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, handed over the golden key of the building to the Japanese ambassador yesterday. Ambassador Oshima replied, saying that the new building is a symbol of the friendship between Japan and Germany and a guarantee of the victory of the Axis countries. After Japan uses the building, the cooperation between Japan and Germany will become closer.</p>
<h3>Chilean Military Preparations</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 26th (Central News Agency) The Chilean government, unable to withstand the high pressure from the US government, has finally severed diplomatic relations with the Axis countries. According to reports from Santiago, the current military situation in Chile is roughly as follows: (Army) The current army has four divisions, approximately 80,000 men, with excellent equipment and well-trained, the best in Central and South America.

<h3>Overseas Chinese in Vietnam Will Establish Federation</h3>

<h3>Chengdu Miscellany January 20 (Transmitted from Macau)</h3>
<p>Li Guangpu, the director of the Xikang Finance Department, came to Chengdu from Kangding. It is said that since Xikang Province was established in the 28th year of the Republic, the provincial-level financial revenue has increased from more than 900,000 yuan to more than 13 million yuan. The county-level self-governance finance is currently being reorganized. It is expected that the county-level self-governance financial income of the entire Xikang Province can reach more than 30 million yuan when the reorganization is completed.</p>
<p>One hundred and thirty-nine counties and cities in Sichuan Province have established temporary parliamentary assemblies, with a total of 3,532 councilors, of which 3,398 are male and 134 are female.</p>
<h3>Japanese Revised Cabinet Control Strengthening Prime Minister's Authority</h3>
<p>The defects of the Japanese cabinet system have become a common ailment of successive cabinets. The main reason for these defects is the egalitarianism of cabinet members. The position of the Prime Minister is merely the nominal head of the cabinet, and he actually has no power to direct cabinet members and maintain the unity of national policy. According to Article 55, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution, the Prime Minister is in a position to assist and advise, and is essentially different from the Minister of State. According to Articles 2 and 3 of the Cabinet Official System, although he has special status and authority, he cannot be considered to have the power to direct or order other ministers. This point has always been an unresolved issue. Since the end of the party cabinet and the formation of a unified national cabinet, there has been a unanimous call to strengthen the authority of the Prime Minister for the sake of unifying national policy.</p>
<p>If the Cabinet Official System is revised to strengthen the position and authority of the Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister uses the qualification of Minister of State to direct and order other ministers, it would conflict with the Constitution. However, in the position of administrative minister, the Prime Minister's position is superior to that of the ministers of each province, and it is not impossible to give instructions. Therefore, it can be legislatively recognized that the position of the Prime Minister is higher than that of the ministers of each province in administrative matters.</p>
<p>During the Abe Cabinet era in Showa 14 (1939), there was an imperial edict stating: "Overall control over the exercise of the National General Mobilization Law, etc." This measure centralized the implementation of the National General Mobilization Law to the Prime Minister. It stipulates that all provincial ministers must first consult with the Prime Minister regarding the implementation of the National General Mobilization Law; the Prime Minister may directly instruct the provincial ministers regarding the implementation of the National General Mobilization Law. The above-mentioned imperial edict is a precedent for strengthening the Prime Minister's authority in administrative matters. This wartime authority special case can also be regarded as following the previous example. The main issue is that the Prime Minister can instruct the ministers of each province. The so-called instruction is not legally considered to have any compliance, but it has considerable binding force. At present, it can be considered as recognizing the guiding position of the Prime Minister. (Transcribed by Ren from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, January 10th.)</p>

<h3>Approved by the Military Distribution Authority, Sugar and Oil Will Be Distributed According to Population, Based on the Household Registers of Baojia, Various Procedures Are Being Planned and Prepared</h3>
<p>In order to maintain the legitimate needs of Shanghai residents for sugar and oil, the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office and the Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office have adopted a rationing method and handed it over to registered retailers to sell in accordance with the prescribed methods. Recently, in order to prevent reselling for profit and eliminate malpractices, a special request was submitted to the military distribution authority for approval to implement the distribution of sugar and oil according to population. Regarding the method of distribution according to population, the cooperative and the wholesale office have completed drafting and have separately issued notices to all retailers for re-registration. All preparations are in order, and the implementation will be announced publicly after consultation with the relevant authorities. A reporter from this newspaper learned from the sugar and oil offices yesterday that: (1) The distribution of sugar according to population has been determined to be piloted in the Nanshi area starting from the fourth phase. Distribution will be based on the household registers compiled by the Nanshi Baojia, and will be distributed according to population with the assistance of the Baojia organizations. The amount distributed will be based on the total amount approved by the military distribution authority and distributed evenly. The price will be calculated in accordance with the prescribed price limit. As for the remaining areas, starting from the fourth phase, sales will temporarily be based on house tax receipts, with each receipt allowing the purchase of 50 yuan of sugar. If the pilot project in Nanshi is effective, it will be implemented citywide starting from the fifth phase. (2) The distribution of oil according to population was first piloted by the wholesale office in cooperation with the Baojia districts. The results were quite good after households purchased oil with oil purchase certificates, and the activities of the oil squeezing gangs in the past have been slightly curbed. Currently, preparations are being actively made to implement the distribution of oil according to population in the near future, based on the household registers of the Baojia, and all methods are similar to the distribution of sugar according to population.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Authorities Release Statement Explaining the Honest Attitude to Hold in the "War of Ideas"</h3>
<p>From the Dōmei News Agency in Shanghai, a Japanese military spokesperson declared yesterday at the regular meeting for news reporters that the large number of Chongqing troops defecting to the Nanjing peace camp is the most powerful evidence that Chongqing's view in China has been weakened since the Nanjing government officially entered the war. Nanjing's declaration of war clearly indicates that the National Government has decided to cooperate with Japan to defeat the common enemy and establish a new order in East Asia. The strongest point of the Nanjing policy lies in this, which has a great impact on weakening Chongqing's anti-Japanese ideas. This can be proven by the increasing number of Chongqing troops surrendering voluntarily recently. Since Nanjing's entry into the war, there have been repeated discussions on strengthening China's industrial power to assist Japan, and strengthening military power to consolidate peace and order within the Nanjing jurisdiction. The spokesperson reiterated the contradictions in Chongqing's thinking, stating that on the one hand, Chongqing has decided to fight to the end to protect China's independence, and is led by Chiang Kai-shek to drive the people to achieve this goal. On the other hand, Chongqing must continue to rely on assistance from other countries, which shows that Chongqing's position is self-contradictory and holds the opposite view to Nanjing's policy. In this "war of ideas," Nanjing is indeed holding an honest attitude.</p>
<h3>China and Jiaotong Banks Prepare to Provide Agricultural Loans</h3>
<p>Since the reorganization and resumption of business of the China and Jiaotong Banks in September of last year, they have been operating general commercial banking businesses in accordance with the regulations of the two banks promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, focusing on developing trade, supporting industry and commerce, promoting production and industry, handling investment and lending businesses for industry and commerce, and adjusting industrial and commercial economy with the cooperation of the Central Reserve Bank. Currently, the steps for resuming business in various branch offices are actively underway. In addition to the resumption of business in the branch offices in Hankou and Nantong, the branch offices in Wuxi, Suzhou, Bengbu, Wuhu, and other places can be resumed gradually after the Lunar New Year. It is understood that the two banks are preparing to handle rural lending businesses in the mainland in order to adjust rural capital and revitalize the economy. Currently, Jiaotong Bank has sent personnel to various townships to investigate the actual situation in rural areas. Those areas with abundant rural products and a definite need for funds will be given as much lending as possible.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Chu Returns to Nanjing After Completing Official Duties</h3>
<p>Chu Minyi, member of the National Government and Minister of Foreign Affairs, returned to Nanjing by train yesterday afternoon after spending a week in Shanghai since his arrival on the 19th of this month. Minister Chu's visit to Shanghai was the first since the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States. Therefore, in addition to attending the establishment ceremony of the National Diplomacy Promotion Association on the 20th, he specifically visited the envoys of various friendly countries, the heads of the army and navy, and other leaders to express his gratitude. He also met with leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai for cordial talks, which were very harmonious. The preparations for the takeover of the concessions and negotiations with various parties were also very satisfactory. It is said that Minister Chu will visit Shanghai again soon.</p>
<h3>Grain Bureau Sets Deadline for Reporting Changes in Household Registration in Each District</h3>
<p>The Municipal Grain Administration believes that the meticulousness of the distribution of grain according to population is of great importance to the changes in household registration in each district. In order to prevent any omissions in the distribution of food rations to citizens in the urban area, it specifically ordered the district offices in each district and the fang offices in Nanshi to report the changes in household registration in their respective districts in detail to the bureau before the end of each month. This will ensure that the distribution of food becomes more meticulous.</p>

<h3>Public Holiday for Major Japanese Festivals Being Considered by Shanghai Municipal Council</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council is currently considering a proposal to take public holidays for major Japanese festivals, which is generally expected to be approved, as the French Concession has already decided to adopt this measure.

<h3>Finance Bureau Urges Payment of Fines</h3>
<p>In order to effectively rectify the financial affairs of the city, the Municipal Finance Bureau recently issued a notice to all tax collection offices under its jurisdiction, stating that all fines and taxes of various kinds for the 31st year should have been paid in full. However, it has been found that a few tax collection offices have not yet reported and paid, which is very inappropriate. Therefore, it is specifically ordered that all tax collection offices must quickly report and pay the full amount immediately and without delay, so as not to incur penalties.</p>
<h3>Difficulty Finding Housing Near the End of the Year, Temporary Sheds and Stalls to Be Demolished Later</h3>
<p>The authorities previously issued a notice through the Putuo District Baojia Association, ordering the parties concerned in the factories in the district to demolish all the temporary sheds and stalls in western Shanghai before the end of this month in order to avoid fires and prevent the spread of diseases, otherwise they would be strictly investigated. According to sources, after learning about this regulation from the authorities, the residents of the temporary sheds, because the end of the year is approaching and it has become more difficult to find housing since the implementation of the Baojia system in this city, have jointly requested the authorities to postpone the demolition. In consideration of the hardships of the poor residents of the temporary sheds, the authorities have extended the deadline for demolition to the end of April.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consuls-General of Three Provinces Hold Meeting to Decide on Economic Strategies for Central China Promoting the Initiative of Chinese People to Develop Construction Power Abolishing Regionalism and Implementing Comprehensive Development</h3>
<p>The meeting of the Japanese Consuls-General and Consuls of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces was held at the Shanghai Office of the Embassy on the 23rd of this month.

(2) Correcting the regional groupism of each region and implementing comprehensive and unified economic countermeasures. (3) Opposing the complete application of the Japanese-style controlled economic system in China, but carefully considering the actual situation in Central China and adopting practical and feasible measures. (4) Comprehensively reorganizing various control organizations. (5) Actively developing surface and underground resources to enrich economic power.</p>
<h3>The Eighth Batch of Coal Distribution Postponed to Lunar New Year The Coal Distributed is a Type of Jiaozuo Coal Briquettes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Dazhong Coal Company has been purchasing goods in large quantities from various coal-producing areas in China and transporting them to Shanghai in a steady stream, distributing them to various counterparts in the industry on schedule. However, the bituminous coal distributed by the company to its counterparts is all submitted to the authorities in advance, and standard price limits are set. Therefore, any counterpart who obtains the goods must buy and sell according to the price limit and must not secretly increase the price to seek profits, because all counterparts who obtain the goods have been given generous profits under the law. According to news from the coal industry yesterday, the eighth batch of coal distribution was originally planned to be officially distributed in the near future, but because various procedures have not been fully completed, it may be postponed to the Lunar New Year. As for the type of coal distributed this time, it is a type of Jiaozuo coal briquettes, which is suitable for burning in major pancake and fried dough stick stalls. The total is</p>
<p>Three thousand five hundred tons</p>
<p>a decrease of 500 tons compared to the previous period, but the market price per ton has not yet been revealed. However, all counterparts in the industry have prepaid half of the payment to the Dazhong Coal Company, and the remaining half will be paid in full when the goods are shipped. It is understood that the amount of bituminous coal shipped to Shanghai recently has not decreased slightly compared to the past, which has greatly benefited the inventory. Due to the frugality of various circles, the demand for bituminous coal has sharply decreased. In the face of this situation of oversupply, the supply of spot chips has not increased, so the entire coal market situation is very stable.</p>
<h3>Central China Tobacco Distribution Association Bans Black Market and Implements Price Limits Cigarette Shops Must Register by January 31 Those Who Violate the Rules Will Have Their Distribution Stopped</h3>

<p>The Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance is rectifying the tax system and changing the cigarette unified tax to ad valorem collection. It was originally scheduled to be implemented on the 20th of this month, but according to the request of Chinese and Japanese tobacco manufacturers, it was postponed to yesterday (the 26th) to implement the new tax system. For the first level of ex-factory prices of 7,500 yuan or more, the ad valorem tax rate is 55%; for the second level of ex-factory prices of 5,501 yuan to 7,500 yuan, the ad valorem tax rate is 50%; for the third level of ex-factory prices of 3,501 yuan to 5,500 yuan, the ad valorem tax rate is 45%; for the fourth level of ex-factory prices of 1,501 yuan to 3,500 yuan, the ad valorem tax rate is 40%; for the fifth level of ex-factory prices of 1,500 yuan or more, the ad valorem tax rate is 35%.

It is heard that in the future, the tax will be levied uniformly according to the prices stipulated by the Central China Tobacco Distribution Association.</p>
<h3>Distribution of Flour by Population in Western Shanghai Three-Part Coupons Distributed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of this year's distribution of grain by population in western Shanghai, the first phase of rice distribution has been completed and the second phase will be actively organized. With the assistance of the Grain Administration, the district authorities have completed the compilation of the flour purchase coupons for this year and handed them over to the Baojia heads of each fang, who began distributing them to citizens within the boundary yesterday. The monthly coupons are divided into three phases, and the distribution of flour in the first phase can also begin within the next few days. Those who have not received the flour distribution certificate can obtain it from the Baojia heads of each fang.</p>
<h3>The Way to Preserve Wealth (6)</h3>
<p>— Nie Yuntai</p>
<p>What is the way of Heaven? The Book of Changes says that the alternation of Yin and Yang is the way. This Yin and Yang is not illusory; everything has facts to follow. Where there is day, there must be night; where there is cold, there must be heat; where there is spring and summer, there must be autumn and winter; where there is high tide, there must be low tide. Observing these natural phenomena of mountains and rivers, everything is a cycle of waxing and waning, increase and decrease. From this, we can extend it to human affairs, which are also like this: prosperity and decline, joy and sorrow, worry and happiness, order and chaos. However, the Yin and Yang of heavenly timing have certain standards that remain unchanged for all time; the prosperity and decline of human affairs change constantly with the movement of people's hearts. This kind of impermanent change still originates from the fixed standards of the way of Heaven, which is a cycle of Yin and Yang. Let me explain this as follows: If people like to be arrogant, there will definitely be a time when they suddenly lose their footing. If people like to be lazy and comfortable, there will definitely be extremely difficult days to come. If people like to be stingy and greedy for money, there will definitely be sons and grandsons who indulge in gambling and extravagance to ruin the family fortune. If people like to be cunning and calculating, there will definitely be foolish and stupid sons and grandsons who are deceived by others. Those with wisdom can naturally pay attention to and see these changing human affairs, knowing that they are exactly the same as the rising and setting of the sun and moon and the coming and going of cold and heat. The way of Heaven is like a Taijitu, half white and half black, with a boundary in between. If Yin and Yang lose their balance beyond this boundary, changes will occur, which is called Yin arising from the extreme of Yang and Yang arising from the extreme of Yin. In other words, extreme prosperity must decline, and extreme decline must lead to growth. The great sages of ancient times understood this principle, so they taught people to always put themselves in a disadvantaged position, that is, to be humble and yielding, to give away wealth without becoming poor, and to restrain oneself and benefit others. Common and ignorant people are absolutely unwilling to do such disadvantageous things. Modern scholars will scoff and say that this is passive morality. They do not know that all the great and active undertakings in world history have been done by people who follow this passive morality. Because being passive and self-restrained leads to actively benefiting others; giving away wealth without being greedy leads to managing public interests; and being humble and yielding makes people respect and admire us, making it easier to do things smoothly and succeed. The first step seems like a loss, but the second step is still a great advantage. Shallow and ignorant people can only see the surface of everything and cannot see the opposite. It's like playing chess, only seeing one move and not seeing the second or third move, not knowing that worldly affairs are all like playing chess. When I make a move, the opponent must respond to my move, and immediately there will be a second or third move following. Buddhism explains the principle of cause and effect, which is actually the highest science and philosophy in the world. I use playing chess as an analogy: every word we say and every deed we do is a move we make against others. The thoughts and intentions we have in mind when we speak and act are a move we make against Heaven. All people and all living things are our opponents in chess. If we show kindness to a dog, the dog will wag its tail and be friendly to us. If we speak harshly to it, it will drag its tail and walk away. The same is true for people. If I am humble and generous, people will be grateful. If I am arrogant and mean, people will resent me. These are still small opponents. If we bully those who are incapable, or secretly harm people, or use clever means to take advantage of them, causing them to suffer losses without even realizing it, or use our special position, such as being an official or the manager of a company, to secretly seek personal gain, or if we are already wealthy and do not want to help those in disaster while enjoying comfort in our own homes, these things are beyond the control of the public and the law cannot do anything about them. He considers himself to have won the chess game, and his opponents have all lost. However, the way of Heaven does not allow him to win and will act as his great opponent on behalf of the public, making a gentle move that leaves all his chess pieces in a stalemate, ultimately leading to his utter defeat. This is called "Man has a thousand calculations, but Heaven has only one." We are playing chess with people every day, but in reality, we are playing chess with Heaven. The more we win against people, the more seriously we will lose against Heaven. Conversely, if we are willing to be more lenient with people and help them at every turn, preventing them from losing, we will not lose too much ourselves, and we may even win a big game of chess against Heaven. The aforementioned Fan Zhongyan is the most obvious example. He was extremely poor to begin with, but after being a general and prime minister for decades, he still had no private land or mansions when he died. From the perspective of ordinary people, he was busy for nothing in his life. However, he won a big game of chess against Heaven, and his sons and grandsons were all noble, prosperous, and talented. The other ones such as Yerü Wenzheng, Lin Wenzhong, and Zeng Wenzheng were all willing to lose chess pieces, and in the end, they all won a big game of chess against Heaven. Those who could win chess pieces, made tens of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, but later lost everything when Heaven made a move. The ancients said, "Man can conquer Heaven, but Heaven can also conquer man." Heaven's decree is the unchanging principle of Heaven. The law of Yin and Yang requires balance. When people do things excessively, they lose that balance. Because our heart light reaches and counters the moderation of Yin and Yang, reactions occur and we are subject to the constraints of the laws of Yin and Yang, causing us to return to a state of equilibrium. Heaven plays chess without moving its heart or hands, and people are naturally defeated. For example, when we throw a ball against a wall, the ball will naturally bounce back. The greater the force of the throw, the greater the force of the rebound. The wall does not move its hands or exert any effort. Therefore, the Book of Documents says, "Calamities sent by Heaven may be avoided, but calamities brought on by oneself cannot be escaped." Mencius said, "What comes out of you will return to you." This means that self-made karma will receive its due reward, which is exactly the same as what the Buddhist scriptures say: "self-created cause, self-reaped result." Man conquering Heaven is not really conquering Heaven, it means that people act according to the principles of Heaven, and the victory they ultimately obtain is actually a victory of heavenly principles. Originally poor and lowly, later prosperous and successful; originally worried and troubled, later peaceful and happy. Such a victory is still a victory of heavenly principles. Although I say that virtuous people win a game of chess against Heaven, in reality, Heaven also wins. It must be known that the way of Heaven will never lose.</p>

<h3>Money and Banking Industries Well Prepared to Begin Year-End Closing Four-Day Holiday Scheduled from February 5th to 8th</h3>
<p>Following the decision by the money industry to set the year-end closing date for the 31st year of the Republic of China as February 4th, all industries will follow suit and handle their year-end closings accordingly, with a four-day holiday scheduled from February 5th to 8th, and trading resuming on February 9th. According to news from the money and banking industries yesterday:</p>
<p>Notifications for Closing of Overdraft Accounts</p>
<p>(1) Due to the busy collections and payments related to the year-end closings of various banks and industries, the money shops have begun to handle their closings. All overdraft accounts, unless otherwise stipulated in a contract, have been separately notified to return all outstanding balances and interest before the year-end closing, calculated at 5 yuan. Interest owed up to January 30th will be calculated, and interest owed will be calculated at 28 yuan up to the year-end closing date. The time for receiving and returning checks for the lunar New Year's Eve by various banks and money shops, as well as the exchange time for notes by the money and banking industry exchange, will be discussed by the money industry clearing house and the joint bank reserve association. The daily upper and lower interbank lending rates in the money market have been formally announced yesterday and will be open until February 3rd, with interbank lending rates resuming on February 9th.</p>
<p>Dispatching Personnel to Collect Outstanding Debts</p>
<p>(2) In addition to handling year-end closings, various companies, factories, and firms have separately dispatched personnel to collect outstanding debts from previous periods. Except for this period, lending transactions will be suspended, and all transactions will be based on cash. Each will also carefully manage their financial position and repay outstanding overdraft accounts to the money shops in order to maintain the inherent commercial credit. Due to the year-end closings, the money market has scheduled shutdowns to close accounts, and trading will resume on the market after February 9th. Since the Central Reserve Bank and the money and banking industry reserve clearing house handled interbank lending for money shops, liquidity has remained stable, which is a normal phenomenon before the year-end closings. Therefore, all industries are determined to safely pass this year-end closing period.</p>
<h3>Changes to License Fees for Marriage, Funeral, and Coffin Transportation</h3>
<p>According to reporter investigations, the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Headquarters Traffic and Air Defense Section's proposal to change the license fees for marriage, funeral, and coffin transportation has been approved by the authorities and will be implemented today (the 27th). The fee schedule is: (1) Marriage procession license fee: 10 yuan per license; (2) Funeral procession license fee: 5 yuan per license; (3) Coffin transportation fee: 3 yuan per coffin.</p>
<h3>Ueno Taichu Succeeds as Head of the Education Department</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office announced that Mr. Ueno Taichu has been appointed as the head of the Education Department of this bureau from the 23rd of this month to fill the vacancy left by the former head, Mr. Hawkes Pugh.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Spokesperson Discusses the Counteroffensive in Burma: Allied Forces Can Advance by Land, but Conflicting Opinions Make Implementation Difficult</h3>
<p>A Reuter dispatch from Shanghai: Yesterday, a Japanese military spokesperson, at a reception for the press, criticized Chongqing's intensified propaganda regarding Allied offensives aimed at retaking Burma. The spokesperson stated that neither the Chongqing troops in India nor the Indian army possess the capability to counterattack Japanese forces in Burma. The spokesperson further noted that in addition to geographical difficulties, the Allied forces face disagreements among the Chongqing, British, and American commanders in India regarding the direction of attack and who should lead the assault. The spokesperson described Chongqing's hopes of recovering Burma by land as mere fantasies, elaborating on the difficulties the Allied forces would encounter in entering Burma and various obstacles along the Indo-Burmese border. Reportedly, the Allied forces have three possible routes for invading Burma: firstly, advancing from India through the Indo-Burmese border; secondly, attacking from Yunnan; and thirdly, launching a large-scale naval assault on the southwestern coast of Burma. However, the Indo-Burmese border presents immense challenges for the Allied forces. When the Chongqing troops retreated from Burma, they undoubtedly experienced the hardships of weather and terrain. If the Chongqing troops attempt to re-enter Burma, they will inevitably face the same geographical difficulties. Moreover, the approaching rainy season will worsen the situation. The strength of the Chongqing troops in India is estimated at three infantry divisions, one artillery brigade, one supply transport regiment, one cavalry battalion, one signals brigade, and one engineer battalion. Chongqing strongly desires the British to launch an offensive from the west, while the British and Americans prefer Chongqing to attack from Yunnan. The three commanders have failed to reach a consensus on this point despite repeated discussions, highlighting a major issue among the three Allied nations. The Chongqing troops are certainly incapable of launching an offensive from Yunnan and even believe the Japanese army's small-scale mopping-up operations in Burma are a prelude to a Japanese invasion of Yunnan.</p>
<h3>Abolition of the Chinese Inquiry Office After the Establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry</h3>
<p>A Reuter dispatch from Shanghai: News last night indicated that following the establishment of Japan's Greater East Asia Ministry, the Chinese Inquiry Office, which the former Asia Development Board established on Jiaxing Road in Shanghai in March 194*, will be abolished on Thursday. Hereafter, all applications and notifications from Chinese citizens to various Japanese government agencies should be handled by the Second Section of the General Affairs Department of the Japanese Embassy here. Civil disputes between Chinese and Japanese residents should be handled by the Judicial Affairs Department of the Japanese Consulate-General, and other issues should be addressed by the Chinese courts.</p>
<h3>French Concession Police Hope for Resident Cooperation in Rat Catching: The Claim of Catching One Rat Per Night is Incorrect</h3>
<p>The French Concession's Avenue Joffre and other districts had previously distributed rat traps to households and businesses due to rampant rat infestations, initiating a rat-catching campaign. News recently obtained from the police clarified that the purpose of this campaign was solely to encourage residents to pay attention to rats within their homes and capture them as much as possible. The previous rumor that the authorities required each household to catch at least one rat per night, otherwise fines would be imposed, is entirely inaccurate. While the French Concession health authorities are actively encouraging residents to catch rats, they have not mandated a specific nightly quota.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Schedules Distribution of Butter Permits</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council issued Notice No. 6243, scheduling the distribution of butter permits at the distribution office located at 234 Route Ma Ho on the 28th and 29th of this month and the 2nd and 2nd (sic) of February. Registered butter users can bring their police identification cards to collect their permits at that time. Those who fail to collect their permits within the specified dates will have their registration revoked immediately.</p>
<h3>Tap Water Contains a Salty Taste: A Natural Phenomenon Every Year; Lower Water Levels in the Huangpu River Cause Seawater to Enter the Pipes, Containing Salt, but it is Absolutely Harmless to Health</h3>
<p>Recently, the tap water in the International Settlement has contained a strong salty taste and appears turbid, raising concerns about drinking water hygiene and causing public anxiety. A reporter from this newspaper specifically interviewed the chief engineer of the water company, who stated that this is a natural phenomenon that occurs every year in the twelfth month of the lunar calendar. This is because the water level in the Huangpu River is significantly reduced at this time, and the high tide outside the Wusong Estuary rushes into the Huangpu River. The Yangshupu water source in the International Settlement is located close to the Wusong Estuary, so seawater may enter the water pipes, causing the water to taste salty and become turbid. This is beyond human control. However, the chief engineer assured that the presence of salt in the tap water is absolutely harmless to health. The situation is expected to return to normal in about two months, after the water level in the Huangpu River rises. The French Concession, with its water source located in the area of the 16th Dock, further from the sea, has not experienced the same phenomenon.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Congee Kitchen Distributes Congee Application Forms</h3>
<p>The Shanghai West Congee Kitchen, sponsored by the Shanghai 31st Year Winter Relief Office, is issuing congee application forms in advance of the congee distribution to estimate the number of recipients. It is reported that the demand for these application forms is extremely high, indicating that there are many impoverished people in this city in need of relief. This city is not lacking in charitable individuals, and we hope that they will generously contribute to this worthy cause.</p>
<h3>Overview of Important Administrative Matters of the Shanghai Municipal Council for the Past Year (Yesterday) (To be continued)</h3>
<p>Regarding the Currency System</p>
<p>Regarding the currency system, the Council received a letter from Mayor Chen of the Municipal Government, stating that the National Government, considering the declining value of the old legal tender and to stabilize the financial situation, decided to abolish the equal value of the Central Reserve Bank notes and the old legal tender, effective May 31st. To implement this plan, the Government decided to exchange old legal tender for Central Reserve Bank notes at a rate of two to one in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as in the cities of Shanghai and Nanjing. Furthermore, all debts and obligations denominated in old legal tender should be converted to Central Reserve Bank notes at the same rate. The purpose of this measure is to enhance the position of the Central Reserve Bank notes as the sole legal tender in China and to protect the people from the effects of the old legal tender inflation. Mayor Chen hoped that the Council would fully cooperate in this matter and assist in reducing the prices of daily necessities. The Council immediately replied, stating that it had already taken steps to adjust all income and expenses to be denominated in Central Reserve Bank notes and guaranteed to cooperate fully with the Municipal Government to jointly suppress prices, at least to the extent possible.</p>
<p>On February 14th of the previous year, the Council published a notice stating that, effective that day, all payments of new and old accounts to the Council in cash would only be accepted in Central Reserve Bank notes. Subsequently, on June 9th, another notice was issued, declaring that, effective June 19th, all payments to the Council should be made by cashiers' checks from the Central Reserve Bank of China or banknotes issued by that bank. On June 12th, the Council issued another notice, stating that all security deposits previously paid to the Council would be deemed to have been converted to Central Reserve Bank notes at a rate of two to one. After the National Government promulgated the regulations prohibiting the circulation of the old legal tender, the Council issued a notice on June 24th stipulating (1) that the use of the old legal tender would not be permitted in the International Settlement from June 25th; from that day forward, Central Reserve Bank notes would be the sole legal tender; (2) unless otherwise notified, subsidiary currency notes with a face value of five jiao or less issued by the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and China &amp; South Sea Bank could be used within the Settlement at a rate of two to one; (3) anyone found to be in violation of this notice would be prosecuted according to the law. The Council informed Mayor Chen that all cases of violations of the rules prohibiting the use of the old currency would be investigated, and if the evidence was conclusive, the violators would be prosecuted in the Chinese courts.</p>
<p>The Newspaper's Broadcasting Time Yesterday Was 7:30 PM</p>
<h3>"Helping Students is the Greatest Good, Doing Good is the Greatest Joy": Middle School Group to be Selected Today; Applications for University and Business/Trade Groups Have Closed; Over 30,000 Yuan Received in Donations from All Sectors Yesterday</h3>
<p>"Helping students is the greatest good," and "Doing good is the greatest joy." After receiving over 30,000 yuan in donations from all sectors for student aid yesterday, and encouraged by the donors with these words, the staff of this newspaper feels both grateful and humbled. We respectfully dedicate these words to all the gentlemen who generously donated to support education. The details of the donations received yesterday and the middle school group's examination today are as follows:</p>
<p>Middle School Group Selection Set for Today</p>
<p>The middle school group's selection examination will be held today, both morning and afternoon, at the Shanghai YMCA Middle School on Sichuan Road. The high school grades 1-3 will be tested from 9:30 AM to 11:30 AM, the junior high grade 1 from 1:30 PM to 3:00 PM, and the junior high grades 2-3 from 3:30 PM to 5:00 PM. In addition to the exam papers provided by this newspaper, students are requested to bring all necessary supplies and arrive on time for the examination.</p>
<p>University and Business/Trade Applications Closed</p>
<p>Applications for student aid from the university group and the business/trade supplementary school group closed last night. Over 400 application forms were received. The selection, investigation, and review of the university group will be conducted after the list of approved student aid recipients for the elementary school group is announced and the investigation of the middle school group is largely completed. The exam and vacation start dates for the various schools, including elementary, middle, and university, vary considerably. Therefore, the application registration, selection, and investigation procedures must be completed in order, according to the closing date and the sequence of examinations. The student aid office staff will strive to manage the time efficiently within the meticulous procedures to alleviate the students' longing.</p>
<p>Yu Kee and Yick Kee Generously Donate Large Sums</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Mr. Yu Kee and Mr. Yick Kee, who generously donated large sums, personally visited the newspaper office to offer encouragement for the student aid project. Mr. Yu Kee and Mr. Yick Kee were especially concerned that the number of elementary school applicants reached over 800 and feared that limited aid funds would not be enough to cover everyone, resulting in many elementary school students unfortunately dropping out of school. Mr. Yu Kee and Mr. Yick Kee have been reading this newspaper daily and felt deeply disturbed. They personally donated over 20,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes and instructed that the funds should be allocated to the elementary school applicants as much as possible. Their benevolent words were deeply moving. The newspaper's student aid committee will properly manage these funds with the compassion of Mr. Yu Kee and Mr. Yick Kee for the children, aiming not to disappoint their expectations.</p>
<p>Donations Received Yesterday</p>
<p>The student aid funds received yesterday included 10,000 yuan from Yu Kee, 10,000 yuan from Yick Kee, 2,000 yuan from Xing Shao Er Zi, 1,000 yuan each from Wang Wen Yuan (gifts from friends and relatives celebrating his son's full-month), Yu Kee, and the Yan Wu Family Tian An Trust, 500 yuan each from Qin Run Sheng, Wu Kee, and the Mei Chong De Hall, 800 yuan from Mr. Li, 300 yuan each from Yong Kee and Hao Kee, 200 yuan each from Mr. Tian and Ren Kee, 180 yuan from Jun Sheng, 100 yuan each from Yao Kee and Hu Yun E, 50 yuan each from Sheng Kee, Fan Wen Jiang, Gao De Yong, Chen Guan Kee, and Zhong Shan Kee, 30 yuan combined from Mr. Yuan and Mr. Xia, 20 yuan each from Xie Yin Chu, Mr. Lu, Zuo Gen Fa, Ling Zhuan Zhen, Yang Da Wen, and Yang Tian Zhang, 10 yuan each from Gao Gen Hui and Bi Wu Zhong, 8 yuan from Da Ding Lu, 5 yuan each from Hui Ji Hui Zhao and Liu Qing Nan, and 4 yuan and 8 jiao from Zhu Yuan Kang (found). The total amount received was 30,125 yuan and 8 jiao in Central Reserve Bank notes. The previous balance was 144,351 yuan, 8 jiao and 5 fen, bringing the total balance to 174,477 yuan, 6 jiao and 5 fen.</p>
<p>Wang and Qin Donate Wedding Gifts to Student Aid</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received letters from (1) Mr. Wang Wen Yuan of Da Feng Industrial Company, stating: "As we celebrate the full month of my son Geng Nong, we have received generous gifts from friends and relatives. While I cannot decline them, I believe that during these extraordinary times, we should be thrifty. Therefore, I am contributing the funds originally intended for the banquet, rounded up to a whole number, to your newspaper's student aid fund, totaling 1,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. Please accept it." (2) Mr. Qin Run Sheng of the China Pottery Bank stated, "As my son Xing Yuan is getting married, we are grateful for the gifts from friends and relatives during these difficult times. We have decided to donate the cash value of these gifts separately to various charitable organizations to provide relief. A portion of these gifts, totaling 500 yuan in national currency, is being donated to your organization to benefit friends and relatives."</p>
<p>More Donations, Fewer Dropouts</p>
<p>The total number of students applying for student aid in the university, middle, elementary, and business/trade groups this year has reached over 3,000. Thanks to the generous donations from all sectors in recent days, each additional day of donations translates into fewer young people dropping out of school. Reading the donation reports every day is like witnessing the righteous rescuing impoverished students from fire and water, helping them reach the other shore. The donations received yesterday mean that at least 200 elementary school students will be able to carry their schoolbags back to school. This scene fills us with joy amidst the sorrow as we see students on the verge of dropping out of school break into smiles. We earnestly hope that all sectors, recognizing the large number of students requesting assistance and upholding the principle that "helping students is the greatest good and doing good is the greatest joy," will continue to donate. Once we have collected enough funds to provide assistance, we will inform everyone.</p>
<p>Various Schools Set Up Free Tuition Slots</p>
<p>This newspaper yesterday received letters from various schools offering free tuition: (1) A letter from Shanghai Jian Cheng Middle School stated, "After reading your newspaper's articles appealing for help for impoverished students and the long queues of those requesting student aid, anyone with a heart will be moved. Our school, as an educational institution, is limited by its finances and unable to broadly assist the impoverished. We feel ashamed at our inability to do more. We are now offering ten free tuition slots each for the first year of high school and junior high, specifically for your newspaper to select and recommend deserving candidates. If we exceed this quota, we can first transfer the free tuition slots donated to our school by Mr. Hua, Mr. Shen, and Mr. Shao, to jointly assist outstanding impoverished young people. There should be no boundaries between us." (2) A letter from Ms. Wu Yi Zhi, Principal of Shanghai Women's Middle School, stated, "Your organization's student aid fund for impoverished children, benefiting the needy, is truly commendable. Our school, advocating for education, dares not lag behind. We have established five free tuition slots in the senior year 2 and senior year 3 classes. We hope your organization will select and recommend excellent candidates, and we will waive all tuition and miscellaneous fees to do our part." (3) A letter from the Fourth Vocational Supplementary School stated, "Recently, prices have risen sharply, and most schools have appropriately increased tuition fees to maintain operations. However, ordinary impoverished children find it difficult to afford education. In light of this, our school has established regulations for free tuition slots. We have always admired your organization's efforts in supporting the younger generation, sparing no effort. Therefore, we are specifically writing to inform you and request that you recommend students from your organization's student aid supplementary school group to our school for supplementary studies, with a quota of ten students, limited to one subject, as a small token of our appreciation."</p>
<p>Mr. Pu Ji Ting Donates an Overcoat</p>
<p>This newspaper received a letter from Mr. Pu Ji Ting, offering a pair of riding breeches overcoat as a commemorative gift to anyone who donates 2,000 yuan. We are grateful for Mr. Pu's kindness. The overcoat will be temporarily stored here. His original letter stated, "I am sending a used pair of riding breeches overcoat, which is of high quality and in perfect condition. During this difficult autumn, I cannot bear to wear it. I am specifically presenting it to your newspaper and hope that you will appeal to all benevolent individuals that anyone who donates 3,000 yuan or more to the student aid fund for impoverished children will receive this overcoat as a commemorative gift. It is a small token of my appreciation, hoping to inspire others. I hope that they will generously contribute to benefit the young people and perform a great deed."</p>
<p>Crowded Scene of Applying for Student Aid</p>
<p>Few funds, many students, insufficient distribution, hoping that all sectors will donate more. Tian Ming Zuo</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Reports on the Situation of Public Utility Companies Last Year</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th of the previous year, the various public utility companies in the Settlement were taken over by the Japanese army, placed under military administration, and entrusted to Japanese trading companies for management and normal operation. The status of each company's operations last year is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Shanghai Electric Tramways Co.</p>
<p>Last year, the operating expenses of the Shanghai Electric Tramways Co. increased dramatically. In order to make up for this, the Council approved an increase in tram fares from June 5th, to be collected in Central Reserve Bank notes. At the same time, the Council approved the restoration of full-line service on Lines 5 and 8 and the conversion of all tramcars (except trailers) to first class, effective June 5th.</p>
<p>(2) Shanghai Waterworks Co., Shanghai Power Co., Shanghai Telephone Co., Shanghai Water Co.</p>
<p>Last year, at the request of the Japanese authorities managing the above four companies, forwarded by the Japanese Consulate-General, the Council agreed to revise the tariff rates of these companies and to collect them in Central Reserve Bank notes, effective May 20th from the end date of the user's period.</p>
<p>(3) China General Omnibus Co.</p>
<p>Due to a lack of fuel, the China General Omnibus Co. suspended all bus services, causing transportation difficulties between the Settlement and the West Shanghai area. In order to remedy this, the Council, with the understanding of the French Concession Public Works Department and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, approved the application of the Hua Zhong Urban Omnibus Co., the custodian of the China General Omnibus Co., on November 27th to resume some routes in the Settlement and the West Shanghai area, running buses powered by charcoal and coal. As of the end of last year, the bus lines in operation were as follows: Route 25, from Jiangwan Road Shanghai Shrine, via Dixi Road, Wusong Road, Haining Road, North Sichuan Road, Sichuan Road, to Avenue Edward VII; Route 26, from the Great World, via Avenue Edward VII, Avenue Foch, Avenue du President, Columbia Road, to Avenue Haig; Route 27, from Jing'an Temple, via Avenue du President, Route Frelaut, Columbia Road, to Chenjiaqiao Town.</p>

<h3>All-Shanghai Open Basketball League: Xingren Wins Group A Championship; Red Team Finishes Second with Nine Wins and One Loss</h3>
<p>The All-Shanghai Open Basketball League held its most exciting finale last night, starting at 7:00 PM at the Chinese YMCA. In the women's division, the You Team overcame Lingsheng with a score of 16 to 14, winning the women's championship. In the second game, Xingren defeated Beifeng with a score of 40 to 31, completing a perfect ten-win, zero-loss season and winning the Group A championship. In the final game, the Red Team defeated Lianxing with a score of 32 to 26, finishing second with nine wins and one loss. There is one final game tonight between the Mengnuoke and Bing Teams. Group A will then have been successfully completed. The Meng Team is extraordinary and had great hopes for the championship, but after suffering a treacherous blow from a teammate, they were repeatedly defeated last night, although their performance was still commendable. If they can defeat the Bing Team tonight, they will share third place with Lianxing and Huanan. If they lose, they will share fifth place with the Giant Team. Currently, the Group A championship has been won by Xingren, with the Red Team finishing second with nine wins and one loss. Lianxing, Huanan, and Mengnuoke follow. The Giant Team is in sixth place. Beifeng, Hualian, and the Tongren Three-in-One team are tied for seventh place. The Bing and Yihai Naval teams are in last place with ten losses. The You Team in the women's division secured first place with four wins and zero losses. The Lingsheng Wildcats are in second place with one win and three losses.</p>

<h3>Chinese Stocks Continue to Advance, Especially Department Stores</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market continued to be dominated by buying sentiment, with various stocks rapidly advancing to new highs. Credit conditions eased, and although a few holders sold shares for cash, they were absorbed by wealthy investors. The department store sector, in particular, continued to rise. Wing On Company broke through the 140 yuan level, surging from 138 yuan to 143.5 yuan, a gain of 5.5 yuan. The National Goods Company rose even more sharply, soaring to 83.5 yuan, a gain of 3.5 yuan. Sincere Co. was in high demand at 152.5 yuan, rising 5 yuan. Lai Wah Company was sought after at 390 yuan, a jump of more than 10 yuan. The cultural sector also saw strong growth. The Commercial Press rose another 10 yuan, reaching 485 yuan. Chung Hwa rose 5 yuan to around 185 yuan. The World Book Co. approached the 120 yuan level, also rising 2 yuan. Longmen Bookstore was priced between 13.5 yuan and 14 yuan. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco rose 3 yuan to 136-7 yuan. Da Zhonghua Match highest 322.5 yuan, later came back a little, also rose 2 yuan New drug industry also generally rose, Sino-French saw 28.25 yuan, New Asia 25.25 yuan, afternoon slightly back, still see squeeze up, Min Yee over 61 yuan, also slightly straight, Shin Yee 250 yuan, Five Continents do 665 yuan, China 445 yuan, are noon price, each up 2.5 yuan, New Asia Enzymes 22 yuan had a transaction. In the textile industry, Wing On Textile Mills rose to 355 yuan, a gain of 7.5 yuan. Meiya (New) reached a high of 34.75 yuan. The small denomination China Textile Printing and Weaving once again approached the 10 yuan level. Great Brightness had buyers at 12 yuan. Yowsheng and Kwok Kwong Dyeing and Weaving were still in a buying position at above 12 yuan. The situation at San Fung Printing and Dyeing was stable, while the situation at Shinfu was slightly less favorable. Among food stocks, Amoy Canning saw a high price of 380 yuan under the double benefit of generous interest payments, but there were still no sellers. Wah Feng Enamel rose from 76.5 yuan to 80 yuan. There were still few buyers for financial stocks. It was heard that buyers for the Zhejiang Industrial Bank had bid as high as 900 yuan. In the utilities sector, Zhabei Water and Electricity saw 66.5 yuan, while China Electricity highest 46 yuan, at noon each back half a yuan, still squeeze up one yuan to five corners, all parties are determined, and transactions become more frequent.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds in High Demand, All Exceeding the 50 Yuan Level</h3>
<p>The public bond market saw further increases yesterday, with sellers becoming even scarcer, creating a situation of high demand. It is likely that credit conditions have eased for all banks, and some now have surplus funds. Since the environment has improved, people are gradually becoming more optimistic. Buying dear and selling cheap is the common rule of the cycle. Yesterday, Class C bonds initially traded at 7 yuan, then saw 7.5 yuan and 8 yuan. After that, they slowly rose, with the highest bid reaching 9.5 yuan before any actual bonds were sold. Finally, the market retraced to 7.5 to 6 yuan, but it was still a yuan better than the previous day. Class A bonds traded at 7.3 to 4 yuan, Class B at 7.1 to 2 yuan, Class D at 54.7 to 8 yuan, and Class E at 5.6 to 7 yuan. All of them broke through the 50 yuan level. However, the volume of transactions was extremely low.</p>
<h3>Small Rebound in Military Notes and Joint Notes</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Shanghai Money Exchange Association's call loan interest rate remained at 17%, unchanged.</p>
<p>Yesterday, military notes rebounded slightly. Interbank trading was priced at 5.5524 yuan. Small money shops and bank branches traded at 5.55 and 5.56 yuan. Joint Reserve Bank of China notes had rebounded slightly by one jiao. Dealers were buying at 3.85 yuan and selling at 3.90 yuan.</p>
<h3>Soybean Cakes: Profitable Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market conditions for miscellaneous grains saw only soybean cakes being traded somewhat. Due to profit-takers selling, prices immediately fell back. Specifically, Kaiyuan Long soybean cakes were traded at 160.5 to 160 yuan for four cartloads; Feizi soybean cakes were traded at 105 to 105.5 yuan per cartload. February futures of Yuan Long cakes were priced at 107 yuan per cartload.</p>
<h3>Fine Cloth Rises by Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market started strong but weakened later. Fine cloth, etc., rose by two yuan. Sijunzi serge rose from 11.10 yuan to 11.30 yuan, then fell to a low of 10.50 yuan, and was at 10.90 yuan at noon, relatively stable.</p>
<h3>Woolen Cloth Trading: First Discussing Shipping Documents</h3>
<p>There is a shortage of both domestic and imported woolen cloth. Standard prices continue to rise. Many have already reached the price limit, and some have exceeded it. Buyers are gradually losing interest. Also, with the Lunar New Year approaching, brokerage houses' overdrafts must be repaid. Therefore, actual transactions are not as numerous as last week. Even shops with ample cash will first discuss the issue of shipping documents when they find suitable goods. Only if they can obtain shipping documents, deliver the goods, and then receive payment will they consider the deal. Otherwise, they will not trade if they are asked to pay first and then receive the shipping documents and goods, or if the goods are delivered privately without shipping documents. This is because there is no fixed date for issuing shipping documents, and goods without shipping documents cannot be recorded in the account books or issued with sales receipts. This demonstrates the importance of shipping documents for woolen cloth these days.</p>
<h3>Persimmon Cakes Continue to Arrive: Opening Price Forty Yuan Lower Than Before</h3>
<p>Recently, several more cartloads of persimmon cakes have arrived, bringing supply and demand into balance, so the trend is easing. Yesterday, one cartload was sold, with a price forty yuan lower than before. Previous inventories have been cleared, so although a price decline is observed, it is unlikely to fall too low.</p>
<h3>Price of Secondary Wood Ear Fungus is Relatively Favorable</h3>
<p>Some ordinary quality black wood ear fungus has been shipped in by merchants from outside the region. The quality varies, and some contain impurities and debris. Therefore, the opening price is relatively favorable. A batch was traded at 3,200 yuan. Even after rescreening, the cost remains high, so there has been little change in market prices.</p>
<h3>Shipments Halted: Prices of British and American Cigarettes Rise Again</h3>
<p>Due to the Hua Zhong Tobacco Association still handling registration of businesses in the same trade, shipments of British and American goods have essentially stopped. Overall, procedures for allocation and shipment are unlikely to be completed within the Lunar New Year. As a result, prices are rising due to market expectations. The price of Great Britain brand is 12,400 yuan; Old Knife brand is 10,400 yuan; Pin Hai brand is 7,700 yuan; Wu Hua brand is 6,850 yuan; and Fairy brand is 8,100 yuan, all one to two hundred yuan higher than the previous day. Japanese cigarettes Jin Paipi are 3,000 yuan; Jin Da Lou is 3,750 yuan; Red Rose is 2,700 yuan; All Luck brand is 3,500 yuan; Nian Zhi is 3,050 yuan; and Compass brand is 2,850 yuan, all remaining stable. Domestic cigarettes Pyramid is 6,450 yuan; Beauty brand is 5,900 yuan; Gold Rat brand is 4,100 yuan; White Gold Dragon is 4,200 yuan; and Golden Dragon is 4,200 yuan, showing only a slight price increase.</p>
<h3>Match Prices Resume Surge</h3>
<p>In the market for daily necessities, prices for various goods continue to rise, especially match prices which are trending upward again. Soap prices are mixed, with some steady and others rising. Candles remain calm and unchanged. Phoenix brand is 4,050 yuan; Beauty brand is 4,200 yuan; Golden Tripod brand is 3,400 yuan; and Miscellaneous brands are 2,250 yuan, an increase of one to two hundred yuan compared to the previous day. Gu Ben soap is 800 yuan; Bai Xiang Mao is 725 yuan; Huang Xiang Mao is 660 yuan; Scissors soap is 750 yuan; White Riley candles are 560 yuan; Monk's Cap brand is 480 yuan; and Miscellaneous brands are 340 yuan.</p>
<h3>Daily Medicines: Speculators Still Involved</h3>
<p>The market price of medicines is rising due to extensive involvement by speculators. The market is showing brisk activity. Headache powder is 38 yuan; Universal Oil is 49 yuan; Bagua pills are 44.5 yuan; Partridge vegetables are 70 yuan; and Longhu Rendan is 40 yuan, all showing an increase compared to the previous day's prices.</p>
<h3>Cabbage and Winter Bamboo Shoots Sell Especially Well on the Streets</h3>
<p>In addition to cabbage from Chongming, Jiangbei, Jiaozhou, and Tanggu being shipped to Shanghai, recently, cabbage from Tianjin has also arrived in Shanghai. With the Lunar New Year approaching, many citizens are buying it, and street sales are especially strong. However, the supply is not large, so prices have risen repeatedly. Cabbage from Chongming and Jiangbei, which was around 50-60 yuan per dan at the beginning of the month, with vendors retailing it for 80-90 cents per jin, has now risen to 120-130 yuan per dan, with vendors retailing it for 1.80-2 yuan per jin. Cabbage from Jiaozhou is currently priced at 170-180 yuan per dan, with retail prices ranging from 2.20 to 2.50 yuan per jin. Cabbage from Tanggu is priced at 2.40-2.50 yuan per jin, and cabbage from Tianjin is priced at 2.50-3 yuan per jin.</p>
<p>Winter bamboo shoots from Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, have been on the market for a while, but the supply is limited. With peak sales season upon us, supply is insufficient. Vendors at the Hongsha Ni Bamboo Shoot Market are now selling them for 13-14 yuan per jin, up from 10 yuan. South goods stores are selling them for around 12.5 yuan per jin. Ordinary bamboo shoots from Longyou are selling for 10.5-12 yuan per jin, and small bamboo shoots are selling for 8-9 yuan per jin.</p>
<h3>In the Depth of Winter, Firewood and Charcoal Sales are Active</h3>
<p>Firewood: In the depth of winter, the weather is frigid. In addition to coal, firewood is also used for starting fires, so the demand for firewood is high. Residents use it to ignite coal stoves, so sales have been exceptionally active recently. However, the supply of firewood is not smooth, and the inventory of packing case firewood is dwindling. Therefore, the price is rising frequently. Currently, top-grade chestnut firewood is priced at 50-60 yuan per dan, and medium-grade is 54-55 yuan per dan. Small sections of wood used for vehicle fuel are even more brisk, with each dan rising to over 70 yuan and still hard to find. Large, dry pine firewood is 58-59 yuan per dan, and medium-grade is 55-56 yuan per dan. Due to the shortage of packing case firewood, retail prices have also risen to 1 yuan per jin. Miscellaneous tree root firewood is 70-80 cents per jin.</p>
<p>Charcoal: With the end of the Lunar Year approaching, the need for charcoal among residents has increased significantly. It is used for starting stoves and is in high demand in restaurants for heating hot pots, so prices remain firm. Currently, coal shops are selling pine charcoal at around 200 yuan per dan. After sifting out the debris, the retail price at the store is 2.5 yuan per jin. Pieces that are slightly more uniform are sold at 3.4-3.5 yuan per jin. Stream Jiang charcoal costs 41-42 yuan to 53-54 yuan per basket, medium baskets cost 32 yuan to 35-36 yuan, and small baskets cost 25-26 yuan to 30 yuan.</p>

<h3>On Thrift</h3>
<p>— Objective</p>
<p>Recently, everyone is talking about thrift. Thrift is "frugality." The Chinese have always regarded "frugality" as a virtue, and sages and classic texts often use it to encourage people. In books like Chao Zha's "Gems of Wisdom," the "good words" about "frugality" can be said to be "inexhaustible."</p>
<p>Of all the writings I've read on thrift, Sima Guang's "Instructing Jian to Observe Frugality" is the most satisfying. Based on his extensive knowledge, he lists stories of frugality among historical figures and of people who brought misfortune upon themselves through extravagance. The most memorable passage is: "When Zhang Wenzie was prime minister, his personal lifestyle was the same as when he was a clerk in Heyang. His relatives advised him, 'Your Excellency now receives a considerable salary, yet you live like this; although you are confident in your frugality, outsiders criticize you for being as poor as Gongsun Hong wearing a cloth quilt. You should conform to others a little.' Zhang sighed and said, 'Although my current salary is enough to clothe and feed my whole family in luxury, what am I worried about? I am worried about the common human tendency that it is easy to go from frugality to extravagance, but difficult to go from extravagance to frugality. Can my current salary always be available? Can I live forever? If things change tomorrow, my family, accustomed to extravagance, will not be able to suddenly be frugal and will inevitably be lost. How can I, whether in or out of office, alive or dead, always be the same?' Alas, the deep foresight and long-term planning of a great sage is beyond the reach of ordinary people!"</p>
<p>Next, Sima Guang expounds on the virtues of "frugality" and the evils of "extravagance." He says: "Yushi said: 'Frugality is the shared characteristic of virtue; extravagance is the greatest of evils. "Shared" means common; it means that those who have virtue all come from frugality. Frugality leads to few desires; a gentleman with few desires is not controlled by material possessions and can act in accordance with the right path; a common person with few desires can be careful in his conduct, moderate in his spending, stay away from crime, and enrich his family. Therefore, it is said: Frugality is the shared characteristic of virtue. Extravagance leads to many desires; a gentleman with many desires becomes greedy for wealth and status, distorts the right path, and hastens disaster; a common person with many desires becomes demanding, wasteful, loses himself, and ruins his family; therefore, officials inevitably take bribes, and villagers inevitably steal. Therefore, it is said: Extravagance is the greatest of evils.'" Sima Guang instructed his descendants on frugality not just with empty words but also by practicing it himself. However, his practice was not for the sake of seeking fame and reputation. Therefore, he says:</p>
<p>"Throughout my life, I have dressed to keep warm and eaten to fill my stomach; I do not dare to wear dirty and tattered clothes to deceive the public and seek fame. I am simply following my nature!"</p>
<p>Extravagance is certainly undesirable; but if one is hypocritical, like what is described in "Officialdom Unmasked," the evil of "hypocritical frugality" is just as bad as "extravagance."</p>
<p>Sima Guang was one of the most forceful opponents of Wang Anshi's New Policies. Although their political views differed, both great men were able to maintain "frugality" and had clean integrity and pure and noble character. Therefore, in history, they "each have their own merits."</p>
<h3>Third Place Winning Essay: My Plans for This Year</h3>
<p>— Yuan Ying</p>
<p>Training Myself in the Forging of the Times</p>
<p>The mention of plans makes me feel ashamed, apprehensive, and fearful.</p>
<p>Last New Year's Eve, an old teacher wrote in my yearbook: "The past year has passed; how will you spend the next year, that brief but also long period?" So, in order not to fail his kind intentions and to set a path for myself, I made a plan on the morning of this year's New Year's Day.</p>
<p>However, throughout the year, the busyness of events cooled my enthusiastic heart, which had been encouraged and hopeful, and the instability of the environment shattered all my wonderful plans; I involuntarily lived a life I did not want to live, letting the "brief but also long" days of the year quietly slip away. If the old teacher were to ask me again, "How did you spend this year?" I would not know how to answer; in reality, I myself do not know how I have been living.</p>
<p>For now, let the past be past! I am deeply considering how I will use this new year.</p>
<p>This year—this new year—will be a segment in my life's history. This autumn, I will begin to write a new page in my life's history. But because of the ills and corruption of the current education system, and the ever-increasing hatred and weariness I have felt for it over the years, I am unwilling to continue spending my youthful years and energy in a place I hate and am weary of. Moreover, everyone knows that now is neither a good time nor a good place to study properly! Why should I continue to have my father's hard-earned money spent on useless things?</p>
<p>"Step into society!" is my main plan for this year, although this is only a hope. In present-day China, society and school are completely isolated in two different worlds; there is no bridge between them, no connection. Everything in school, except for a diploma, is of no use in society, and everything in society cannot be learned in school. Why should I waste countless time and money studying useless things? I am a living person, I want to read living books, learn living knowledge! And society is our real school, a school that is burying countless rich books and knowledge. I should step into this school.</p>
<p>Of course, I also know that this society is not a good society; it is like a cesspool, full of countless darknesses, countless evils. I also know how difficult it is to find a door, needing boasting, needing hypocrisy, needing... But all of this cannot stop my steps. I do not escape, nor do I flinch. I will muster all my courage, strengthen my belief, and step into society with big strides.</p>
<p>Society, some say it is a furnace, some say it is a touchstone, and some say it is a den of evil. But whatever it is, I have to throw myself into its corner, to observe, to learn, and even to expose myself.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is also to share some of the burden of life that weighs heavily on my father.</p>
<p>Another major plan is to work even harder for the free school. In the second half of last year, this work took up most of my time and energy; but only this work can inspire my passion and eliminate my depression. Although the work is hard; on rainy nights, carrying a large pile of notebooks, I hobble along the muddy road with weary steps; on nights when the northwest wind shakes the windows, I often work late into the night to grade papers;... but all of this only increases my joy, my comfort. In this turbulent era, I have at least fulfilled some small obligations to society and contributed some small amount of strength; compared to some people, I should be proud!</p>
<p>Therefore, this year, as long as the school can continue, I will continue to offer my small amount of strength, for the children, for the society, for the motherland, and for humanity!</p>
<p>During the summer vacation, if nothing special happens, I will continue to write my first creation until I finish it.</p>
<p>Because many good themes and deep impressions of many typical characters have been active in my mind for a long time, I also plan to write a few more short stories, and use image-based artistic techniques to erect these familiar people and things.</p>
<p>If I want to summarize it in one sentence: my plan for this year is: study! Work! Writing!—but the main things are studying and working.</p>
<p>This era is a great forging, this society is also a great furnace. This year, I will begin to throw myself into the depths of this furnace, and train myself, enrich myself, and strengthen myself in the forging of the times.</p>
<p>Müller said: "Rather than being discouraged by not being able to fully carry out one's plans, it is better to feel happy and have a hundredfold of courage when you see that a small part of the plan can be realized."</p>
<p>I know that the years of this year will still disappear swiftly, only "brief," not "long." Wait until New Year's Eve this year, when people are busy thinking about new plans for next year, let me review how I spent that brief year! (Note: Yuan Ying is 18 years old, a senior in high school at Nanguang High School, and a teacher at Yangguang Free School.)</p>
<h3>The Idiot and His Idiotic Deeds</h3>
<p>— Chen Bi Yun</p>
<p>Xuehua, whom I hadn't seen for a long time, suddenly blew into my house like a gust of wind. I warmly welcomed her. I said, "Miss Tang, you've become famous. Are you rushing to Shanghai to see the publications that have printed your great works?"</p>
<p>She pulled a face and blamed me for being so polite. Then she said that coming to see the Shanghai publications was indeed one of the purposes of her visit, but the biggest purpose was that she had heard about an idiot and his idiotic deeds and wanted to be idiotic too. When she said that, I naturally didn't understand and urgently asked for the details.</p>
<p>According to Xuehua, she had come to be a teacher at "Jiying" Elementary and Middle School on Yu Garden Road. As soon as she mentioned "Jiying," I immediately jumped up and said, "That's the school where my three children study. I've been there. It would be great if you could teach there. But I don't know what you mean by idiot and idiotic."</p>
<p>She said that the school's principal, Fang, was the idiot, and that she had done some idiotic things. She didn't want to sit comfortably as a young mistress but insisted on finding something to do. She also didn't want to do anything that would make money, such as hoarding goods or engaging in other businesses, but wanted to open a school. Having opened a school, she didn't want to earn a single penny. The tuition and miscellaneous fees collected were particularly low, with no exploitation. She would even waive or reduce them, but the salaries and other expenses she paid were not discounted, and she always paid what was due. As a result, she not only didn't make any money but also lost 15,000 yuan in half a year. The money was all borrowed from friends. Some friends certainly approved of her, but others regarded her as an idiot, calling her school an idiotic deed...</p>
<p>After hearing these words, I couldn't help but exclaim, "Really?" Because for the past six months, I had only paid attention to the progress of my children's studies, and I hadn't paid attention to anything else at the school.</p>
<p>Xuehua said in all seriousness, "If it weren't true, would I be here? Wouldn't she be quieter in the countryside? Why would she come to Shanghai, where the air is thick with smoke, to make a living, especially since her health isn't good?"</p>
<p>I said that the school was in a very quiet location, which would probably only be good for her health and not harmful. She said that was right, otherwise it would cause her poor health to become overly idiotic. She also told me that the school building problem had been completely solved and that several more classrooms could be opened. Almost all of the new and old colleagues were excellent female teachers, and she got along with them very well. So, she thought that her idiocy in running so far wasn't for anything else but only to be able to do some things that would directly benefit society, and she had gained considerable comfort from that.</p>
<p>After Xuehua left, her words did cause me to have some thoughts. How many idiots and idiotic deeds are there in society? If everyone is an idiot and everything is idiotic, what kind of society will it become? Conversely, if nothing is idiotic, everyone is opportunistic, and everyone is selfish and seeks profit, what kind of society will it become?...</p>
<p>I couldn't think any further, so I had to write it out and ask everyone to think about it. (Proceeds donated to the scholarship fund)</p>
<h3>A Teacher for All Ages</h3>
<p>— By James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>(9)</p>
<p>Regardless of his particular views on the Boers, he held orthodox views, like everyone else, on Lloyd George and that famous "budget." He did not pay attention to either one. Several years later, when Lloyd George came as a guest to the Brookfield Speech Day, Chips was introduced, at which time he said to him: "Mr. Lloyd George, I'm almost old enough—ahem—to remember you as a young man, and—ahem—I confess that in my view you seem to have—ahem—improved—ahem—a good deal." The headmaster stood beside them, somewhat stunned; but Lloyd George laughed heartily, and in the ensuing ceremony, talked to Chips more than anyone else.</p>
<p>"Just like Chips," someone later commented. "He could get away with anything. I suppose at his age it was all right to say what you pleased to anybody…"</p>
<p>The successor to Wetherby's headmastership was old Meldrum, who had been headmaster for thirty years, and in 1900, suddenly died of pneumonia; before a successor was appointed, Chips became the acting headmaster of Brookfield. There was only a slight chance that the school board might change his temporary acting appointment to a permanent one; but when the school board appointed a young man of thirty-seven, whose medals shone brightly and who could silence the hall by simply twitching an eyebrow, Chips was not really disappointed. Chips could not compete with such a man; he never had, and never would, compete with such a man, and he knew it. He was, through and through, a gentler and less fierce animal.</p>
<p>He resigned in 1913. Those years before his resignation were filled with clearly remembered pictures.(22) Social Services</p>
<h3>Mr. Zhang Yipeng Discusses the Purpose of the Anti-Anglo-American Association Scholarship</h3>
<p>The general situation of the Anglo-American Association's scholarship has been published in yesterday's local edition of this newspaper. The reporter further sought clarification by interviewing Mr. Zhang Yipeng, the person in charge. According to him, the effectiveness of scholarships in helping poor students is obvious to all. There have been many such events held in various places, but with the sharp increase in tuition and miscellaneous fees along with the cost of living this year, it cannot be popularized without subsidies from various organizations. Since the Anti-Anglo-American Association has this great aspiration and has repeatedly entrusted us with full authority, based on our long-standing desire to serve the people and reward rising talents, Mr. Shen Siliang, Pan Yangyao, Lu Gaoyi, Huang Jingwan, and I feel obligated to do so. However, the spring semester is about to begin, and we must intensify our work. We sincerely hope that all sectors of society will supervise and guide us from time to time so that we can achieve a successful completion. Those who wish to obtain this scholarship and believe they meet the conditions are also encouraged to apply early. Please do not apply if you have already obtained scholarships or loans from other sources. The association's brief rules are excerpted as follows:</p>

<p>(2) Deadline - 4:00 PM on January 31.</p>
<p>(3) Address - Room 613, Hamilton Building, Jiang Road.</p>

<h3>Letter from Tian Anshang: Saving Money to Help the Poor and Support Education</h3>
<p>(Above omitted) Your newspaper continues to protect education, which is highly commendable. If it can further encourage scholars with the virtues of loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and cleanness, it will show a greater determination to improve customs and morals. My annual income, after economizing on expenses, can have more than two thousand yuan in surplus.
