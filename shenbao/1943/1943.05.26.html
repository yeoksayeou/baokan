<p>社評</p>
<h3>申論兩種親日派</h3>
<p>吉田東祐先生昨天爲本報特撰專論「兩種親日派」，他推譽第一種「犧牲比生命更重要的名譽，而求國家存亡之出路」的親日派，也就是中國眞正的愛國份子。他抨擊第二種「自始就沒有可犧牲的名舉，爲了金錢什麼都想幹一下」的親日派，也就是爲一般中國人民所切齒痛恨的「漢奸」。吉田先生這篇專論，是給中國讀者看的，我們從這裏可以看出一個眞正站在平等友誼立塲上的日本人的摯誠的意見。我們深信，懷着和吉田先生同樣愛日本並愛中國的擊誠，和懷着推崇第一種親日派痛惡第二種親日派那種心情的日本朋友，一定是很多的。站在增進中國友誼的立塲上，我們還有進一步加以申論的必要。</p>
<p>親日派遣個名詞之盛行，已經有了幾十年的歷史。在日本方面，是否眞正有認識，却一向是一個疑問。往往爲了某一時期政策上的需要，或是一時直覺地認爲某一份子對日本有利，便稱之爲親日派，而加以信任，或盡力加以扶助，使其在中國各方面的地位崇高起來，而不問其根底，不問其眞意，這弁最近二三十年來的中日關係史上，似乎是最普遍的情形。過去關於袁世凱，張作霖以及其他人等所謂親日派的故事，曾經如何徒然增進兩國民間的誤會，以及徒然造成雙方不幸的事件。在這種痛苦的回憶中，我們相信，現在日本當局中具有如吉田先生那種認識的人物應該是很多了。實際上親日應該只有一種，那是眞正愛護中國，同時又認識日本，而希望由中日協力以排擊兩國共同敵人的那一種人。因爲連自己的國家也不愛的人，其親日的動機便極可疑，其不會有利於日本可想而知。或者雖然有了愛本國和親日本的高尚動機，而實際上對日本毫無認識，如吉田先生所謂只是「多少懂得一點日本話」，「投日本人之所好」，那麼，結果同樣必不會有利於日本。所以眞正的親日派，應該是眞正的愛國志士，他的言行智慮，應該愛護本國，同時又顧到日本，具有如孫中山先生那樣以亞細亞人全體利益爲着眼的遠大的眼光，而有不顧其一己私名私利堅强奮鬥的決心者，否則凡是存着一時利用心理，而只在表面上修飾得像樣的，都不會有好的結果。孔子說過：「視其所以，觀有所由，察其所安，人焉廋哉，人焉瘦哉！」這是我們所望於日本人士對於所謂親日派應行警戒者。</p>
<p>在中國方面，如吉田先生所稱譽的第一種親日派，固然也不少，這不但在日本的立塲値得慶幸，就是站在中國的立塲，也是非常可喜的。不過，實際上所謂第二種親日派，那些抱着個人利祿的企岡，而搖身一變成爲親日派，不但在事變初期，而且在目前，還是很多的。這種人的外表或言詞如何，並不値得重視，主要的有如莊子所說：「開其言，而視其行。」在冷靜的觀察之下，就可以發見其眞相，正因爲他的行爲是自私自利，他的親日，實際上是利用日人勢力，不會對日本有什麼同甘共苦的了解與決心，同時對內更不會眞誠替國家人民盡力，相反的是藉着日人勢力來魚肉同胞，他們爲着自私自利，旣可什麼都幹一下，當然對於中日團結最後勝利毫無信念，形成我們所曾指斥過的失敗主義者。因此，他們的行動，便有形無形的造成了對東亞對中日都不利的因素。這種人亦日本人眼光中是「騙子」，在中國人民眼光中便是所謂「漢奸」，在世界的前途着眼，則爲東亞的罪人，在大東亞戰爭決勝過程和在大東亞建設過程中，我們應該盡力檢舉和肅淸這種份子，尤其是要用宣傳啓蒙運動，鼓勵人民檢舉，並督促此種份子的自覺。</p>
<p>在反對第二種僞親日派的過程中，同時必能使盲目的抗戰派所造成的民間之錯覺，他們根據對日本所作不正確的估計與判斷，把日本人列爲中國民族的唯一敵人，而把眞正的敵人掩蔽起來，他們同樣把一切主張聯合日本共同爭取東亞民族之獨立解放的份子，統稱之爲親日派，造成「親日即是漢奸」的口號，深入到民間去，這樣增加了中日兩國民間的誤會，阻碍了兩大民族之聯合奮鬥。我們今日把虛僞的親日派和眞正的親日派嚴格的分別開來，不只是出於聖人春秋正名的大義，而且是爲着中日戰時及戰後合作的永遠前途，我們一定要消滅第二種的僞親日派，我們一定要讓深愛本國兼愛日本共愛東亞的眞正的親日派，在一切事實上來掃除盲目抗日派留在民間心理上的陰影，只有這樣，我們才能更有效和更迅速的對內强化國民政府，對外鞏固中日團結，完成東亞民族解放的大業。</p>
<h3>重要更正</h3>
<p>昨日專論「兩種親日派」文內第五行：「的確很是危險」一句，誤排爲「的確並不是危險的」，請讀者注意。</p>
<h3>史太林的苦肉計</h3>
<p>共產國際執行委員會於五月廿二日向各國共產黨提出結束組織的建議，於是曾經被各國目爲洪水猛獸的國際組織，從此不再存在了。在二十世紀的上半世紀，似乎是一件値得注意的大事。</p>
<p>目前在「世界形勢之新需要」的理由之下，莫斯料發出了結束共產國際並解除各國共產黨對國際所負的責任與義務，其意義就無異是消除了各國共產黨的首腦和連絡關係，至少在表面上，對於各國的共產活動，是一個打擊。不過今日的實際意義，是因爲過去各國當局始終認爲共產國際是蘇聯共產黨和政府的一種御用機關，爲赤化世界的大本營，所以他成爲蘇聯與各國間一切衝突的根本因素。特別是從第二次世界大戰爆發，尤其是德蘇戰爭爆發以後，所謂反軸心國在這幾年來所以彼此矛盾衝突，互相牽制，推究其根源，主要的是在於芙美對蘇的衝突，而英美蘇衝突之根源，又正是莫斯科這個共產國際——赤化世界的大本營之存在。英美自戰爭以來，從未停止反蘇運動，甚至如英國工黨最近亦宣言如與共產併合，無異自絕其前途，也無非爲此。實際上歐洲及其他各地的國家，對蘇聯所最畏懼的也元非是這個組織之存在。</p>
<p>在羅斯福邱吉爾進行所謂兩洋戰略會議期中，在所謂「第二戰綫」到了密鑼緊鼓的時期之中，莫斯科之突然宣布結束共產國際，無論如何，都不能不說蘇聯對英美當局的驚人的讓步，蘇聯當局何爲而願意作如此讓步。雖然未明其底蘊，但最直接的原因與企圖是很明顯的。第一，蘇聯目前遭遇着最大的顧慮，是歐洲的和平運動，英美對軸心一旦和平以後所給予蘇聯的打擊，將是致命的，那時所謂共產國際自然更無存在餘地了。第二，英美對於「第二戰綫」不開闢的口實，是造成蘇聯赤化歐洲的機會，但蘇聯如不得「第二戰綫」之助，顯然不能操持勝算，當我們從這兩點着眼之時，也許讀者都可明瞭史太林何以出此苦肉計了。因爲這個苦肉計實行之後，第一，歐洲的和平運動失去了根據，第二，英美再沒有第二個理由置身於戰爭幕後了。因此，在歐洲，英美所將表演的什麼，可以拭目以待了。</p>
<p>當然共產國際組織之結束，還可能引起其他副作用，首先如若干中立國家，特別是土耳其，西班牙，瑞士，瑞典等，其中立的原因之一是反對蘇聯「世界革命」的計劃，現在會不會再徬徨呢？其次如歐洲許多小國，如芬蘭，挪威，荷蘭，比利時以及巴爾幹諸國，反軸心國必將乘機有所策動，其動向也極堪注目。至於軸心國家，無容諱言，進行這次戰爭的動機之一是反對世界赤化計劃，在表面上這個戰爭的對象似乎已經消滅，在淺見的人們看來，也許這正是軸心國精神上一大勝利。但是根據德方的指示，蘇聯此舉，顯係「故弄虛玄」。「羅斯福惟藉此可以維持其親近史太林政策，並使蘇聯可自由向歐洲發展」。所以實質上，不僅不能以爲共產國際之結束，便是赤化世界計劃之取消，相反的，也可說是赤化活動之新的發展，誠如德國外部發言人所指出的：「史太林解散第三國際，但同時已建立第四國際。史太林前曾稱：將劃波蘭，立陶宛，愛沙尼亞，拉特維亞，芬蘭，挪威，瑞典等國歸其勢力範圍，今日此舉，更堅固此種政策之野心，即將此等國家內分別樹立形式不同之蘇維埃政權」，這一點應該是對於軸心國人士最有價値的警告。</p>
<p>史太林的苦肉計，已使史羅邱三頭會議奠定基礎，同時亦使世界戰爭更推向嚴重之階段，其未來之演變，値得我們注視與警戒。</p>
<h3>日俄戰役　三十八年前本報之紀載　舊報新抄　（六）</h3>
<p>與客論日本所購春日日進軍艦（載本報第一一一一三號光緒三十年二月十二日西歷一九〇四年三月二十八日禮拜一）</p>
<p>有客問於執筆人曰：日人之向捱眞丁國貲購「春日」「日進」二軍艦，蓋以備與俄鏖戰於海天浩森中也，今者戰事初開，二艦已鼓輪而至，宜若可編入艦隊，馳赴軍前矣，何以竟絕未聞作何舉動，豈二艦皆窳敗脆薄，不足用以抵强俄歟？抑恐偶遭挫衂，枉自將巨金付之東流歟？是何　情？子其明以告我。執筆人曰：此二艦也，易虞其窳敗脆薄，不足用哉？考捱眞丁，徐氏瀛寰志略謂之拉巴拉他，亦曰巴他峨拿，（拉巴拉他握京大河名）徐氏以之名其國，蓋誤也。國於亞美利加洲南境，其地一百十有二萬五千八百餘英方里，由衆小國聯合而成，舊爲秘魯之一隅，西歷一千八百零十年，即中國嘉慶十五年，民人咸思崛起，自成一國，迨西歷一千八百二十二年，即中國道光四年，始得叛秘獨立。同治時約合巴西與巴拉圭戰而不勝，自是堅忍圖治，百廢俱興，國勢遂蒸蒸日上，政敎一仿美國，人口二百九十四萬二千有奇，入款歲得九兆七十萬磅左右，出款祇九兆四十萬餘磅，雷綫袤延一萬五千餘英里，鐵路綿長三千三百餘英里，壤地雖甚褊小，而其富强之效，已漸著於美洲。茲之以二艦售與日人，蓋新自英廠製成，其價多至英金一百五十萬磅，砲械機關，悉皆新式，說者謂以擬英國最巨最新之軍艦，無人能判低昂。俄雖稱爲大陸之獅，亦且望而却步，夫安有窳敗脆薄之虞哉？抑兩軍相見，敗者固不堪收拾，勝者亦米必一無所傷。日本自與俄人海上搆兵，俄艦之損壞已多。日前有西友道出長崎，目見左近有三戰艦皆損，夫此所損諸艦，何者非購以巨金，旣全無吝惜之心，何獨惜此春日日進二艦，而深藏不露，不使用以奏海上之奇功，坐令一百五十萬金磅，無異　之於櫝，我知日人斷不至於若是之愚也。客曰：我聞萬國通例，兩國一經開虎，局外之國，即下得以軍裝軍艦濟之，俄殆以此義責捱眞丁，故日人不能用以出戰乎？曰：是亦不然。此次仁川旅順在西歷二月七八號搆兵，日廷於十一號宣戰，俄人如欲扣留二艦，則當日廷宣戰之頃，即應明告英人，而乃遇事濡遲，坐使二艦於十六號安然而抵東瀛交付日人之手，至是而英已全無干繫，一切皆當聽之日人。日人席詎肯遵從强敵之言，而不以二艦列入艦隊乎哉，然則曷爲而不見其出戰？曰：我意二艦甫抵橫須賀港中，砲火尚未配置齊全，將士尚未分派妥帖，鍋爐機舵尚未試騐得宜。夫是以審顧遲回未肯輕使衝鋒陷陣，雖然我竊訝各日報之何以絕無一字提及也。意者其中別有秘密之謀慮，必期一戰而捷，摧敵燄而振國威，此時尚在軍港蟄居，一旦鼓浪直前，幾訝飛將軍自天而下。兵志曰：守如處女，出如狡兎，其春日日進二艦之謂歟，我與子且少安母躁，靜以俟之可也。客曰：子言亦未嘗無見，乃揖執筆人而退。</p>

<h3>交還鼓浪嶼公共租界　法西瑞丹均表同意　租界行政權即可全部收回　外宣兩部昨發表共同公報</h3>
<p>南京二十五日中央社電　外交部宣傳部於五月二十五日下午二時發表共同公報如下：厦門鼓浪嶼公共租界行政權之交還，承友邦日本首先倡導，其中日本關係之一部，已於本年三月三十日國府還都三週年紀念日，由我國接收，此後與其他關係各國，如法國西班牙瑞典丹麥等國交涉之結果，業已先後同意，故該租界行政權之收回即可全部實施。</p>
<p>南京二十五日中央社電　外交宣傳兩部，於五月二十五日發表共同公報，關於厦門鼓浪嶼公共租界之行政權，法西丹瑞等國，均已同意，交還即可實施，値得吾人注目者，即爲向以保守中立之瑞典，對此亦深表同意，於此可知中瑞兩國，刻正恢復正常外交關係，於國府還都後，承認我政府以及恢復外交關係者，已達十四國之多，我政府在國際間之地位，顯已益見增高。</p>
<p>褚外長發表談話</p>
<p>南京廿五日中央社電　關於收回厦門鼓浪嶼公共租界行政權，自經我政府與關係各國如法西瑞丹等國交涉之結果，業經先後同意，即可全部實施。褚部長頃對此發表談話如下：厦門鼓浪嶼本爲自開商埠後，由於英美之蓄意侵略，卒成立公共租界，迄今已四十餘年，與上海公共租界遙相呼應，成爲英美在我國南方之侵略據點，其阻碍我國之自主發展者甚大。我國久欲收回，終因關係複雜，無由着手，故厦門英租界雖經收回，但鼓浪嶼公共租界則維持舊狀，至於今日。迨本年我國參戰後，友邦日本本道義之精神，與我國立即簽訂交還租界及撤廢治外法權之協定。關於日本之專管租界，已於本年三月三十日全部交還，關於鼓浪嶼公共租界行政權，日本關係之一部，亦已於還都紀念日與各地日本租界，同時由我國接收，至其他關係各國如法國西班牙瑞典丹麥等國，經交涉之結果，亦認識東亞之情態，瞭解我國收回之決意，而先後表示同意，因此該租界行政權即可全部實施收回。鼓浪嶼公共租界之交還，承友邦日本率先倡導得順利進展，並獲合理的實施，我國對日本政府之此種熱誠援助，及其他關係國家之善意協助，衷心感謝。我國之有公共租界爲鼓浪嶼與上海兩地，其土地章程及行政條律，雖微有不同，但爲列强尤其英美在華之侵略據點則一。我國爲求自主發展，並謀積極完成東亞新秩序之建設起見，實不容再有此種特殊狀態繼續存在。今因關係各國對東亞之新事態多有深切之認識，先後承認我國之收回，使英美侵略東亞之歷史上的據點，即該地租界，終得完全由我國接收，實具有深長之意義。今茲收回之後，對於友好國家在該地之權益，自當力予尊重，對其商民尤當悉心保護，並謀增進其福祉。</p>
<h3>視察華中前綫返京　畑總司令發表談話</h3>
<p>南京廿五中央社電　日駐華派遣軍報道部五月廿五日發表：畑總司令視察華中前綫，已於廿四日歸返南京，　總司令關於此次視察經過，特發表談話，其要旨如下：余此次赴華中前綫視察日軍作戰狀况，目睹部隊長及將士之戰意，極爲旺盛，實不勝慶欣，此次作戰，先於洞庭湖畔殲滅渝軍四師，復於公安西方地區，粉碎渝軍五師，獲得莫大戰果，此悉賴各將士之奮勇作戰所致。作戰地域，多爲大河湖沼山岳地帶，故日軍將士，確能克服一切地形上之困難，實表現其平素訓練之成功，幷足證明日軍鬥志之激昂。關於作戰日機隊之協力，充份發揮陸空呼應之效力，以致對戰果貢獻極大。又對海軍之密切協力，殊深感謝，此次作戰中，國府方面之軍隊，幷能多所協助作戰，實堪同慶。日派造軍在華北方面本年春太行山作戰收獲赫赫戰果，華中方面幷因此次夏季進攻作戰，而予渝軍以鉅創。總之，渝軍戰意極爲低下，此因日軍屢獲莫大戰果，及渝方俘虜之激增一點，足可證明。余深感渝軍戰力較余三年前抵任之時，已顯著减低。最近龐炳勛率部來歸，民衆幷深能體仰日軍誠意，在各方面協助日軍，如此事實均可謂渝方抗戰地勢，日趨崩潰，此次華北及華中日軍予渝軍之痛擊，確信使重慶抗戰陣營，更加動搖。日前視察鎭江及江北地區之淸鄉工作，幷見收獲莫大成果，最近淸鄉工作機構，力幷改革，此鑒於二年間之經騐，余以爲此係至當之處置，但日軍於作戰警備上，今後仍將積極加以協力者，固不待言。</p>

<p>沙市二十五日中央社電　日海軍長江部隊之開啓宜昌水路作戰，已於二十四日結束，日海軍旗艦，即於二十五日駛入此間。日華中艦隊慕僚，頃於旗艦上談此次作戰經過，大意謂：此次長江作戰，係爲擊破渝方江上之防禦作戰，以掃除通至沙市約一百八十里長江本流之機雷，及其他水中障　物，而開啓水路作戰。是役日軍不僅確保江上運輸交通，且在進攻渝方內地第一階段上，亦予以重創。掃除渝方所敷設之機雷工作，雖極困難，但日軍將士，無不全力以赴，如涉足於濁流中，暗中搜索，予以淸除，決不使共殘留一顆，是以工作非愼重將事不可，日軍將士冒渝軍之頑抗反攻，克服一切艱難，忍受一切犧牲，竭力從事，其努力實深可令人感激。查渝軍過去，即深恐日軍自江上進攻，故在城陵磯上流之要地，敷設大批機雷，堆置障礙物，幷派兵守衛江岸，嚴重監視。同時以民船裝載數百機雷，在江岸各地待命，以便隨時隨地敷設機雷，但最近因日陸軍部隊在沔陽及長江南岸展開作戰後，湘北三角地帶，及該處長江南岸一帶之渝軍，已被肅淸，其大批未敷設之機雷，均被日軍截獲。同時日海軍亦呼應陸軍作戰，克服一切困難，一舉開啓通至沙市之水路，並使沙市宜昌間之水路工作，易於進行，能於必要時，從速予以開啓。凡此均足證明日軍之進攻，將直至潰滅渝軍根據地而後已，故自信有防禦能力之渝方，對此深爲焦慮。溯自中國國民政府布告參戰以後，渝蔣之依賴英美立塲，更趨危險，故乃大事宣傳，不曰日本在南太平洋印度緬甸等地，兵力業已消耗，即曰日本戰力已告大减，且作豪語謂：反軸心陣營必可獲得最後勝利，凡此實無異痴人說夢。日本無論前方後方，均綽有餘裕，日軍在大東亞各戰塲，已獲得光輝之戰果，且佔領地建設工作進行之順利，與戰備之充實，敵方均不得不予公認，尤以在華日軍之活動，已更趨熾烈，而渝方軍心之動搖，亦難以掩飾，因此日軍開啓長江水路，亦宛如匕首之直指渝方心臟。且通至沙市之長江水路開啓，與確保以後湘鄂兩省物資之流通，更趨圓滑，此對中國之復興，與民衆之生活，貢獻甚多，且已有大批民船，開始裝運物資，一般民衆，在日軍保護之下，已均能安居樂業。總之，此次作戰意義，極爲重大，而足以鞏固將來進攻重慶之立足地，此在日本處理渝方問題上，亦具有莫大之關係。</p>
<p>沙市廿五日中央社電　長江日艦隊於此次作戰中，業已溯江而進抵達沙市。長江日海軍部隊最高指揮官搭乘某旗艦，於廿五日十時至沙市海軍碼頭登陸，會見陸軍方面部隊長，致謝此次作戰中陸軍所予之協力。陸軍方面並稱頌海軍部隊之戰果，歡談約一小時餘，始返回艦上。</p>

<h3>廣州灣使用中儲劵</h3>
<p>廣州二十五日中央社電　廣州灣於日軍進駐以後，市面尚有銀幣及以舊法幣爲單位之敵性通貨流通，日軍當局有鑒於此，爲協助中儲券流通起見，此次決定根據日越共同防備旨趣，在該地區內以中儲券代替軍票，此事並已於二十五日發出佈告，俾衆週知。此中儲券在華中華南和平地區，已成爲唯一之基本通貨，信用與日俱增，流通區域，亦日趨擴大。且自本年四月一日以來，軍票停發新鈔後，中儲券地位更趨鞏固，各地已普遍流通，故乃有此次在當地代替軍票之舉。</p>

<h3>宿務島美最高指揮　哈哥薩冷已投降　理解東務首相渡菲意義　願積極協力建設新菲島</h3>
<p>宿務二十五日中央社電　比薩牙地區因日軍之積極肅淸及宣撫得宜，其治安已日趨良好，美殘軍「南部地區最高指揮官」哈哥薩冷中校，已於十日率其子及甥拜爾南法少尉，無綫電技師羅薩洛少尉等幹部九人，向從事討伐中之現地日軍某部隊投降，按戰爭爆發後，該中校因惑於敵方之反宣傳，從事抵抗，日軍自去年九月以來，更以宿務島西南　帶爲中心，以C無綫電臺與比薩牙各島取得聯絡，繼續蠢動，今則山於日軍之澈底掃蕩，該無綫電臺已被完全接收，彼等之遊擊戰術並因而破減。又該校中投降日軍後，頗受優待日軍且正爲其治療所受之槍傷，故該中校感恩之餘，已覺悟抗戰之非計，決定於傷愈後重爲新菲島之建設努力，以答謝日軍之好意。</p>
<p>宿務二十五日中央社電　敵方宿務島最高指揮官哈哥薩冷中校，本月十日投降日軍，現於某某陸軍醫院受日軍之好意治療，極表感謝，以下即該中校誓願建設新菲島之筆證。「余衷心充滿無限感謝，今得保全性命，並得與長男喬耶爾共寢共食，且受日軍溫情看護，實非初料所及。近聞日東條首相躬親視察菲島，不勝感激之至，日本以此種熱意，積極協力建設新菲島之時，菲人爲美國之反宣傳所惑，違反祖國，回顧過去一切，實深漸愧。吾人所最期望者，已經東條首相加以確認，吾人過去雖曾盲目繼續抗戰，然今已理解東條首相之渡菲意義，目前須使一般民衆認識日本之眞意，本人負有解除民困之責，爲達成此任務，決於日本指導下，挺身建設新菲島」。</p>

<h3>谷荻報道部長　在橫濱發表演說</h3>
<p>東京二十五日中央社電　據橫濱電話，日大本營陸軍報道部長谷荻少將，二十五日七時在橫濱市公會發表演說，題爲「英·美雖不足恐但亦未可侮」，茲錄大意如次：美國爲敵方陣營之中堅份子，英國·重慶均依賴美國而繼續實行其前途極爲暗淡之作戰。美國前曾宣傳謂，生產力，人力及時間爲勝利之三要素，余現擬檢討此三點，以說明「英·美雖不足恐但亦未可侮」之理由及軸心方面必可獲得最後勝利之原因。美國擁有世界之資源及最優秀之生產機構，此爲世人所週知，因此美國以天文學之數字，誇示其軍火生產力者，亦爲事實，然其實際生產僅及其所誇示數量之六成，此因某種物資之不足及分配運輸尙欠圓滑所致。先以橡皮不足而言，美國橡皮向有九成係仰給於大東亞中我國佔領地者，現在美國橡皮之存底，約有四十萬噸左右，其取之於中南美非洲等地者，至多僅有數萬噸，至國內重製之橡皮，約爲二十萬噸，英國每年須要量，約須八十萬噸，故現存橡皮，僅可供一兩年之用，因此美國目下以每年生產人造橡皮即合成橡皮四十萬噸爲目的，努力從事，但其工作並未能如意進行。他如鐵·錫·錳·鋁·銳·水銀·雲母等礦物資源，亦均深感不足，於此余顧附加說明者，即美國金鷄納霜之獲得尤感困難，爪哇之萬隆附近，以產金鷄納霜著稱，其產量佔世界之百分之九十八，自該地被我軍佔領後，美英即無從取得金鷄納霜，致國內瘧疾猖獗，無法防止，而演成一嚴重問題，現美國在所羅門，新幾內亞方而之遠征軍，亦多患瘧疾，因無藥醫療斃命者頗夥。溯自大東亞戰爭發生以來，美國竭力擴充軍火生產，較戰前約增三倍，因此非增加工人不可，然熟練工人之是否能迅速增加三四倍，實屬疑問，抑其生產之軍火資材，除供給各地百餘部隊使用外，尙須根據武器貸與法接濟英國，况美及蘇聯而欲完成其所謂「民主國家兵工廠」之任務，是以其生產之兵器並非完全用以對付日本，而用以對付日本者，僅估其少數。又美國欲完全將其用以對付日本，則須安全且確實運至大東亞戰塲發給前綫各部隊，並須用於戰術上，而其空間上，時間上，戰術上之關係，實爲日本所欲利用者，夫英·美缺乏訓練之將士，被驅從事毫無日標之戰爭，而屢以滿足其好奇心，冒險心及英雄主義之戰鬥自炫者，亦惡劣已極，是以美國無數將兵被我軍之殲滅，亦爲應得之報應。次言人力，去年美軍參謀總長馬歇爾及人力動員委員會委員長麥克諾特，曾謂，美國陸軍約爲九百萬人，按現在全美人口共計一億四千萬人，若男女各佔一半，則九百萬人恰佔美國男子全數之百分之一，而九百萬人之數目，在美國亦屬不少，况每　　一兵士背後，又需要有關之軍需勞工及農人。據第一次歐戰時美國之統計，則爲一與十之比，照此比例而觀，欲　軍隊九百萬人，則一般勞力爲九千萬人，此適爲美國生產年齡人口之全部，故後方生產即使已澈底能率化及機化，亦非易事。（未完）</p>

<h3>海軍魂（二）　海鷹</h3>
<p>— 淸水良雄</p>
<p>我們雖然不輕易談祟高的海軍魂，但我願規規矩矩地請一位很可尊敬的一位海鷹。「並非是飛機的優劣問題，而是精神上有差別。當突入眩目照耀的彈林中時的心境，對於生死都早已置之度外，似無論誰，只要一慣這種情形，誰都可能如此」，我一面看看他手脚上的寬大繃帶，而一面安慰他的負傷。且祝福他的武功，但他說：『唉。眞慚愧，尙未得到武功，也未建立甚　成績，眞是一個不中用的人　。</p>
<p>他的純潔，勇敢，謹慎，以及那種彬彬有禮的態度，當我每次遇見他時，總叫我自然而然地，五體投地地尊敬他。</p>
<p>一般人只是到了七十或八十歲時，才開始達觀，但他二十歲就已經非常有涵養。想念到他來到該處以前的身心訓練，簡直使我必須正襟念坐，尤然而生一種敬意。（濤：　自期日新聞）</p>
<h3>日本海海戰與太平洋海戰（一）</h3>
<p>— 富永謙和</p>
<p>（一）Z旗下</p>
<p>第三十八屆海軍紀念日，在大東亞戰爭中第二度又快降臨了。高揭於旗艦三笠號槛項的Z旗，再又在太平洋上隨風飄盪着。</p>
<p>日本海海戰之偉大的戰果，與三月十日的奉天會戰之決　的勝利，同偉結束日俄戰爭的終止符號，是日本人之歷史的追憶的源泉，同時與在地戰局對比起來，其意義更爲重人。</p>
<p>日俄戰爭是西歐白種人侵略世界之史的潮流中在最後階段上所加的猛烈反攻。阻止了西歐白種人的野心，使世界史開始倒流，是對白人的侵略提出正當抗議的勝利紀錄。</p>
<p>日俄戰爭又　近代史上有色人種對白人之最初的勝利記錄。　世紀以來　由於壓迫與虐待而被殖民　化奴隸化的亞細亞民族，因日俄戰爭的影響而達到了解放的黎明了。並使全世界有色人種全面的覺醞起來。</p>
<p>二十世紀開頭，在近代世界史上劃出一大轉變期的是日俄戰爭。</p>
<p>日俄戰爭把從來以歐美爲中心的戰爭加以根本的改革，並又全面的修正了西歐的戰略思想。</p>
<p>日本海海戰使質量俱優的敵艦隊全軍覆沒，在世界海戰史上可稱空前的勝利。</p>
<p>因此「戰」日本乃毅然敢與以海上權力史論的美國資本主義的帝國主義挑戰，日美之宿命的對立，在這一戰役中已埋下種子了。</p>
<p>（二）列强世界政策的衝突</p>
<p>日俄戰爭實是日淸職爭列强大平徉政策的必然結果，所以這戰爭不能祇說是日本與俄羅斯的衝突。</p>
<p>當時德法二國視俄羅斯爲友邦，而英美二國則支持日本。而這二國的所以支援日本，並不是想使日本獲得絕對的勝利以屈服俄國，也祗在有利於本國利益擴張的範圍內，始援助日本。</p>
<p>日淸戰爭後不過十年，日本在日俄戰爭中發揮了出於世界列强意料之外的實力，獲得了光榮的勝利。可是在奉天會戰的大勝戰爭的問題，蓋二十世紀的戰爭，在本質上可稱是澈底的消耗戰將轉移爲不堪負担的消耗戰。</p>
<p>在此期間，戰費的籌措，煞費苦心，國力行將消耗盡凈，而戰爭則仍有不能不繼續之勢。於是孤注一擲的日本海海戰因之而起，以求決一勝負。因此一戰，波羅的海艦隊完全潰滅，而夜郎自大的俄國政府，遂完全喪失了太平洋制海權的自信與希望。</p>
<p>這樣，遂因美國大總統的斡旋，而舉行撲資茅斯和議。</p>
<p>（三）下一次戰爭的張本</p>
<p>在這裏，最堪注目者，開國之來極爲友好，在戰爭中且也繼續抱親日態度的美國，不支持日本了。那是因爲美國不希望日俄二國中有一個國家强大起來。我們不必把羅斯福當作恩人般看待，也不必抱怨他的老謀深算的態度。那不過是國際問的常識罷了</p>
<p>日俄戰爭不單是日俄二國的利害關係，而是所有堅持世界政策的列强之利害關係的反映。列强對太平徉政策的衝突，決不僅是以太平洋爲中心的利書關係。這一點，過去如此，現在亦如此，即將來亦不會變更。</p>
<p>日俄戰爭吿終，而美國在中國的進出漸形露骨，因之日俄戰爭的勝利者新興日本的前途，乃充滿了荊棘。從日俄戰爭的歷史中，早已見到了日俄戰爭的太平洋問題，將爲戰爭的勝利者與調停者之問的問題。</p>
<p>歷史的事實明白地吿訴我們。羅斯福表面上似出於人道主義而提議日俄媾和，而實際上却是爲了開闢美國在中國進出的道路</p>
<p>在太平洋問題上，日美關係的將來，決定於日本海海戰的勝利。在那年之末，日本民衆即已認清下一次戰爭的準備，應向那一方面走，同時，美國也已清楚地認識了二國的關係了。</p>

<p>關於外傳購買戶口糧，須憑防疫證一事，頃據大通社記者向兩租界及滬西各區分別查悉，並不確實。據云當局對防疫注射，確在努力進行，並鼓勵居民實施，但迄今並未規定領購口糧時須憑防疫證醫，因事實上，每戶居民，領購口糧，常派一人爲代表，若須繳閱防疫證書，則於手續旣屬不便，在事實上，亦並不足以證明所呈示之防疫證，究竟是否確爲該領糧者所有也。</p>

<h3>日俄海戰曾建奇勳　出雲艦巡禮</h3>
<p>— 漢儒</p>
<p>昨天（二十五日）下午三時正，外灘日本海軍武官府會議窒內，展開了上海新聞界同仁大集合的畫面，各大報社記者坐滿了一堂，準備出發參觀出雲艦。</p>
<p>鹽田中尉致詞</p>
<p>鹽田海軍中尉，穿着整齊的夏季白色軍服，代表海軍當局向全體報人致詞，從他的口中，我們得知出雲的歷史，和她作戰的勛績，出雲是日本海軍中的老英雄，她上過三十幾次戰綫，僅在日俄戰役中受過敵人十二英吋砲彈兩只的襲擊，作戰士兵僅死三人，此外，則絲毫未受着損害，一直到現在，它仍然英勇地保持着三十八年前的武勳，浮於黃浦江上，司令長官旗在五月的微風中高揚於桅頂，有似守護長江之神。在上次歐戰時，它曾駛入地中海。建立不朽的功勳。其間又一度訪問英京倫敦，參加船賽，榮獲優勝獎狀。</p>
<p>艦上巡禮一周</p>
<p>在艦上會見了恂恂儒雅的艦長，村山淸六海軍大佐。他是出雲艦的第四十九任艦長。第一任艦長是井上敏夫海軍大佐。村山艦長殷懃地招待着參觀人員，態度是誠懇中帶着瀟灑。</p>
<p>另一位長官告訴參觀人員，關於艦員的起居作息狀况：上午六時起身，由艦長率領向宮城遙拜，之後，拭洗甲板，進早餐，八時一刻至九時半打掃內部，九時三刻至十一時半受敎練，十一時三刻午餐，一時體操，開始午后敎練至三時半止，三時三刻至六時訓練劍道·柔道等日本國術，晚餐後休息，八時一刻開始整頓內部，八時半副艦長巡視全艦，至此一日作息告終。</p>
<p>參觀團分成三部，分途參觀全艦，艦員指揮士兵表演者砲彈射擊，主力砲的運用，講述全艦設置，極爲詳盡。</p>
<p>在某處的食桌上，我們見到一部份兵士正在進餐，食品僅白米飯一盅鹽漬菜兩三種與蔬菜一種，茶湯一盌而已，殊爲淸淡。</p>
<p>士官休憇室內佈置得很雅潔，收音機內正放送着由岸上播來的歌聲。</p>
<p>操練室內，展開了日本海軍基本訓練的畫面，劍道·相撲·正在分組操練，士兵們在長官領導之下，認眞地受訓，日本海軍就憑着這樣不斷地猛訓練，擊潰了舊俄艦隊，摧毀了英美太平洋艦隊，成爲東太平洋的干城。</p>
<p>故東鄉元帥手書訓語「忠節·禮儀·武勇·信義。」懸於艙內，這是日本海軍精神訓練的最高標的。</p>
<p>羅馬的造成，並非一日，日本堅强海軍的長成，亦非一朝，我們願中國的海軍從速迎頭趕上去，要克盡協同友邦保衛東亞的責任。</p>
<p>卅八年前海戰</p>
<p>出雲艦是一萬噸級的巡洋艦，於明治卅四年（四三年前，即一九〇〇年）進水。日俄戰役在日本海海戰（一九〇四—一九〇五年）中，爲第二艦隊旗艦，活躍海上。明治三十八年五月二十七日至二十八日的日本海海戰，建立了自有海戰史以來最光榮勝利的金字塔，打破了帝俄的野心，完成了東亞的保衛，築就了今日建設大東亞共榮圈的基礎，是歷史的大海戰。在這次海戰中，一舉而決定這海戰的勝負者，實由於聯合艦隊司令長官東鄉元帥的「敵前方向廻轉」的命令，充分發揮了「割肉切骨」的日本武士道精神的眞髓。東鄉司令長官的這種作戰決斷，使全世界軍事專門家爲之驚嘆。</p>
<p>五月二十七日拂曉，哨戒艇信濃丸打電報給旗艦三笠報告，發見波羅的海艦隊。於是聯合艦隊通知大本營：「接到發見敵艦的警報後，聯合艦隊立即出動，擬擊減敵艦。本日天氣晴朗，但波浪汹湧，以必勝的信念，肅默地自鎭海灣根據地出發，得悉敵波羅的海艦隊在左舷南方約一萬米之處，急將針路轉向西南反航。日本艦隊的速力是十五海浬，波羅的海艦隊的速力十海浬，兩艦隊以每分鐘八百米的比率，漸漸的進達決戰塲。</p>
<p>敵前方向轉廻</p>
<p>午後二時五分，日俄艦隊的距離，縮至八千米，接近十二時砲的有效射程。此時日聯合艦隊司令長官東鄉大將（後爲元帥）在旗艦三笠號的艦橋上，同幕僚們在一起，鎭靜逾恒，默測戰機的成熟，突然舉起右手，向左劃一個半圓形，參謀長加藤少將莞爾微笑，頷首同意。這就是開從來海戰之先例的敵前九十度方向迴轉，即丁字形的新戰術。任何海戰中，在敵前作急角度的方向轉換，是使我艦隊處於最危險的一着，給與敵人砲擊的良好目標，因而古今提督不予採用。然東鄉司令長官雖在眼前見了在質上優於我方的敵方大艦隊的巨砲，但仍毅然實施大胆的轉變針路戰術，更壓迫敵第一艦於東方，揭開了猛烈且準確的砲門，博得了世界海戰史上永垂不朽的大勝利。</p>
<p>因此，這深謀遠慮的戰術，終非紙上談兵的戰術家所能想像。世界軍事專門家稱此次作戰爲東鄉轉迴，潛心研究這戰術，實在很應該的。</p>
<p>第二艦隊旗艦</p>
<p>在這展開東亞運命的日本海海戰中，以第二艦隊旗艦參加的軍艦出雲，其司令長官是當時以勇敢著稱的上村彥之丞中將（後爲大將，）艦長是以謀略著稱的伊知地季玲大佐（後爲中將）。在進擊時，是聯合艦隊的第七號艦。</p>
<p>當迫近這優勢之敵約達一，六〇〇米的近距離時，在砲戰中，出雲艦被敵擊中十二吋砲彈二枚，死者三名，重傷者七名，輕傷者十一名。在這樣大規模的砲戰中，僅有這一點犧牲，可說若有神助。二枚十二吋砲彈中，一枚中士官室，引起火災，立即被將士們撲滅，繼續戰鬥。另一枚洞穿右舷舷側，飛入煤庫，因未爆發，損害尚輕。第二艦隊司令長官上村中將，在戰鬥方酣中，正在羅針艦橋上指揮所屬艦隊時，敵方的跳彈（落下水後，因物理的作用，重又跳起的砲彈）掠過中將的頭上，砲戰之烈可見。</p>
<p>日本海海戰中，戰鬥如此激烈，而所受的損害如此輕微，於是日本國民之間，都似乎相信出雲艦隨時有出雲神社守護着，而譽之謂「萬年不沉之艦」。</p>

<h3>望屋興嘆</h3>
<p>— 小民</p>
<p>說來慚愧，生於期，長於斯，生活於斯，堂堂中華民過的國民，竟然遠不及流徙來滬的白俄逃道，又比不上被逐到滬的猶太難民，他們是沒有國籍的，都是被驅逐出來的流亡者，可是他們當初來滬的時候，還有着以前的租界執政當局的英美人，顧念那些流亡者同是黃髮碧眼高鼻子，惟恐有碍他們白種人的體面，所以特別代爲籌劃，給予居住，加以安挿，於是那些流亡者憑藉着英美人的潛勢力，得以從事種種囤積投機，操縱市塲，居然搖身一變，成爲趾高氣揚的海上寓公了。囘顧我們這些十足道地的主人翁，欲求一席安歇地而不可得者，何止數千百人！</p>
<p>一年多前，兩租界雖有房屋租賃條例的規定，房屋糾紛調解委員會的設置，當時確甚震嚇過那些投機性實的二房東，收過一些小效，可是事過境遷，日久玩生，形式上的糾紛確是由减少而以至於看不見了，可是骨子裏二房東榨取和壓迫三房容的手段愈益變幻丁。</p>
<p>記得某次在報上分類廣吿裏看到千篇一例的徵求「高尚同居，祗限夫婦二人，致兩某某信箱，合則約期面談」等語，於是存着姑且一試的心思，寫信去了，隔了幾天，「音訊」房然來了，「約期面談」，於是按址前往，當由二房東太太接見，一見之下，她就說丁許許多多關於出租的原因和條件，主要的原因是覺得「冷靜」，想找份房客，「做做伴」，順便「貼補貼補」，我的聲明：一本人係正當從業員，不做投機；二是要常期租住的，因爲在這年頭覓屋搬塲，大不容易，她囘說決不會的。榮幸得很，在各種條件具備之下，我們夫婦倆終算做了入屋之賓，以爲從此可以安居樂業，至少可以住上一年和二載。可是世界的潮流日日是在轉變的，二房東的心理也何嘗不是呢？我們住不上幾個月，那位二房東太太便藉詞「收囘自用」，叫我們另去找屋，她又說上許多關於這家頂費多少，那家頂費多少，前房客又怎樣幫她做了幾筆小小投機生意等話，言外之音，可想而知。爲了時勢的艱難，我們爲了衣食住行，二人終日奔波，已經煞費心血，還有那來餘留精神，供人使喚，所以答應她自動加租之外，憑着當切的兩點聲明，婉言謝絕了。我們初來的時侯，她是竭力的表示歡迎和熱誠，現在呢她盡量的表示憎惡和計厭，最近她竟變本加厲，三日兩日的跑來纏個不休。承她的情在鄰近替我們看到一間小小的房，既容納不下二人的傢具，房租尤非我們的力量所能担負，逼着硬要搬塲，在她的意思只要我們搬出了她的門口，死活也可不管。我們因着她的日日催逼，也只有日日多方請託親友，轉報介紹，暮獲一蔭之庇，每晨又在報上召租欄裏找些綫索，一有相當的房屋，便去按址尋防，僅僅一間或二間不是，需素幾個月小租，便得要頂費甚或美其名曰手續費數千以至一二萬不等，還祗好住得上一年半載吧。如欲租頂全幢，普　的里　房屋，就非四五萬不可，且不過戶，以免大房東的干涉，類似這種變相的要索，雖有皇　禁令，奈何神痛廣大的二房東的毫髮呢。在於三房客方南，欲租房屋？只好咬緊牙關忍痛租住下來。可是像我這樣薪水階級的從業員，那有這些閒錢來頂屋呢！照理在這非常時期，業主或二房東不得藉口「收囘自用」，「領服麻煩」而囘絕房客，房客也可拒絕遷讓，但是在同一門口，早晚進出相見，見到二房東太太的那副不快尊容，使人見了很覺害怕，又加上三日兩頭的惡聲辣氣，使人聽了怪覺難受，很想早日遷地爲良，因此在這最近的兩三個月來，每早一路上寫字間，和傍晚一路囘來的時候，一路看到那些形形式式，高高矮矮大大小小的房屋，總要佇立翹首，徘徊多時，最後才嘆着氣，厚　　着臉，帶着虛心，拖着沉重的脚步囘來，進門時惟恐碰見二房東太太的尊容，祗好躡着雙足，偷偷的溜上了樓才算。事實是放在眼前，一方面房屋找不到，一方面二房東太太的惡聲催逼，弄得束手無策，現在的處境竟然遠不如白俄與猶太人！</p>

<h3>日本海軍異聞錄　（三）</h3>
<p>— 大下宇陀兒</p>
<p>（四）六號艇</p>
<p>與飛機比較起來，潛水艦方面的歷史更來得長遠一點。日野大尉的初次乘格拉台式飛機飛行，在開治四十三年之秋，但在同年春四月，已先有那佐久間涎長的故事。現在安置於潛水學校的當時的六號艇，在明治三十七年十一月動工於神戶遺船所，迄三十九年四月竣工。在此之先，日本海軍已有幾艘外圍製的潛航艇。</p>
<p>可是這些當然都是幼稚的潛水艇。直至明洽四十三年，方才開始用酸素熔接的技術。是年白瀨中尉乘開南九赴南極探險。上村彥之丞中將進昇爲大將，夏日漱石被上博士的名位，田中穗積，上杉慎吉二氏同時授爲博士。但那時候雖有潛水艇，不過尙未參加實際戰事，當時法國的潛水艇據說一小時可有八浬的速度。日本報上鄭重其事的加以報道，其性能亦可推知大槪，關於此，尚有一段很有興味的故事。</p>
<p>日俄戰爭時，在旅順港洋面，瑪卡洛夫中將所乘的旗艦彼特洛夫洛司克號，被水雷擊中轟沈，中將以次全部幕僚溺死。這時候船上的乘員想不到這是水雷，更想不到日本海軍中有潛航艇，還以爲是漂浮於海面的奇怪的東西，對之射撃，遂肇成那樣的結果。在這事件之後，俄國的波羅的海艦隊遼遠地從歐洲繞道向東洋航行而來時，司令長官羅奇恩斯脫溫司基中將的面色，神經質牠變得蒼白起來。這所得的情報，日本海軍的潛水艇已經參加實戰，據虛報引起了很大的担心。</p>
<p>在第一次歐洲大戰中，德國的潛水艦的活動極著勳績。</p>
<p>於是日本經了許多研究與犧牲之後，埋首苦幹，加以改良，一面並努力於乘員的鍊成。</p>

<h3>出征（一）</h3>
<p>— 海軍報道班員濱本浩著</p>
<p>一　花草道路</p>
<p>預備中尉江戶貫太郎受命服務的水雷艇，終於在前些日子也拜領到司令官的感謝獎狀，而是有武功的艦艇，江戶興奮地遠遠跑到南大平洋前綫根據地來看她時。但這艘重要的艦艇偏巧出征而未在港。心中覺得非常悵惘，但又無其他辦法。只好在司令部院內的臨時宿合內，等候這艘艇的歸來。</p>
<p>恰好當地的雨季已經過去，是一年當中最天朗氣晴的爽快時節。然而他是突然由內地的嚴冬中跳出來，而此處却又碰到汗流浹背的暑天。</p>
<p>在院內寬闊的草訑上橫穿着花洞。在道路的兩傍，各種的花草點綴得非常合適。有深紅的單瓣花，也有紛紅色的八瓣花。其中夾雜很珍貴的風鈴花，她是一年刹頭總開的。</p>
<p>江戶預備中尉在這個花草道路上偶然碰到了中學的同學松前忠行。</p>
<p>江戶是剛剛到任，穿着雪白的軍裝，而松前則穿着帶有預備少尉領章的整齊陸戰服，手把着皮革包攏着的軍刀，大搖大擺地走來。無論是在紅的眼睛裏，也無論是在日光晒黑了的面頰上，都充滿着戰地的氣味。</p>
<p>「呵！」</p>
<p>松前由於這種偶然的奇逢，不由大聲喊出。</p>
<p>「你也在此地麼？」</p>
<p>江戶甚至以前不知道松前在海軍裏服務。儘管兩個人是非常意外的相會，但兩個人的客套就此而終止了。</p>
<p>江戶因爲是高等商船學校畢業的二等舵手，所以本來他就有預備士官的資格，但松前因爲是帝國大學法律系畢業，而自動志願充當海軍預備學生，所以他僅僅是預備少尉。在海軍中的所謂預備軍官，是從求受過兵學校或機關學校內正式軍官敎育的，正如江戶和松前這類的軍官。預備軍官在帽證和領章上並沒有櫻花，而只是帶着羅盤的徽章。</p>
<p>草地的一角上有一堆帶着黃花的灌木。再前面，可以看得見紅頂的平房。與共稱作平房，倒莫如稱作像床高的兵舍，　爲洽當。</p>
<p>松前目視着那邊問：「你還記得南條松五郎麼？」</p>
<p>「我記得，但他也在此麼？」</p>
<p>是一位同鄕，在中學時代是高兩班的同學。聽說最近在東京當新聞記者。</p>
<p>「是以報道班員的資格駐在此地。現在是這方面的老前輩，且聲望頗不壞，那就是報道班的宿舍。現在去看他，他一定在。」</p>
<p>一聽到這個消息，江戶因爲是剛到。而沒有什麼熟人。所以便想看優，於是說：「領我去吧！」</p>
<p>但松前並不允許地囘答說：「幕僚正在叫我。你一個人去，嚇他一跳吧！」松前走了兩三步後，突然囘頭問說：「你的部隊在什麼地方？」</p>
<p>就在這個期間，天空中隆隆作響的本國轟炸機，大羣排列着在頭上飛翔，似乎眩目般地向天空望着，松前說：「你看，還能聽到內地的軍艦進行曲呢？」二踏上征途</p>
<p>「眞怪！什麼時候來的？」</p>
<p>報道班員南條松五郎還穿着短褲在凉台上的凳上坐着乘凉，但很親熱和藹地這樣間。把頭項上圍着烏黑手巾拿下來，很慇懃地歡迎說：「呵，請坐吧！你把上身衣裳脫下來好麼？」</p>
<p>在同樣凳上還坐着三四個人，只穿一條短褲的靑年也有，以及穿避暑汗衫而面孔現着痛苦表情的人們也有，他們的視綫都集中到江戶身上來。因爲在他的袖章上染着靑地紅圖案似的一個「報」字，所以大家都認爲一定是南條約同事報道班員。</p>
<p>似乎是開什麼會的情形，所以江戶預備中尉有點發拘，便客氣地說：「也許打攪你吧！若是你有空、我再來。因爲很近，我就在對面的宿舍住」。但他好像不想坐下的樣子。</p>
<p>「不要緊，不要緊！坐坐吧」！爲人非常好的南條，把他拖住，說：「這位快要出發作戰去了，所以大家都在此地替他祝福。正好，江戶君你也參加這個歡送會吧！好麼」？和其他人商量了一下，就把同鄕老朋友的漢史介紹給火家了。</p>
<p>「當然歡迎，請坐吧」！</p>
<p>其中也有站起來讓坐位的，所以江戶預備中尉也就坐在大家裏了。</p>
<p>快要出發作戰的這個男人，先拿名片來致意。在名片上印着海軍報道班員，另外在角上還小小地印着跟南條服務的報館不同的報館名。</p>
<p>南條因爲自己的老朋友參加作客了，所以少微心中有些過意不去的樣子，便慇懃地來囘給大家斟水。他一面從凉台一角處摩托都都作響的高貴電氣冰箱裏拿冰鎭啤酒，一面笑着解釋：「這個冰箱決不是奢侈品。因爲是攝影班的必需品，我們就暫借公用器具裝裝啤酒和罐頭等物」。</p>
<p>江戶問出發作戰的班員說：「你到那兒去」？</p>
<p>梳着分髮戴着眼睛的對方說「到瓜達爾克那爾方面去」，接着很輕快地也囘答說也到麟近去。</p>
<p>瓜達爾克那爾，在相當久以前就成爲敵我血戰的海島，目前仍然是繼續着死鬭的最前綫。</p>
<p>江戶很欽佩地說：「報導班諸位先生也很辛苦呵」！</p>
<p>對方一面努力給江戶斟啤酒，一面輕輕囘答：「不敢當，不敢當，作不出什麼成績來」。</p>
<p>正在這時候，囘到自已位置來的南條，便問江戶說：「說起瓜達爾克那爾，但你碰到松前君了麼」？</p>
<p>江戶很感興味地說：「你住的地方還是松前吿訢我的，但瓜島與松前有什麼關係麼」？</p>
<p>南條用手指着傍面肥頭大耳的禿子說：「呵，大有關係。松前在瓜島森林中曾發揮過武俠般的史傳。你問他吧！他因爲當時曾在塲」。</p>
<p>「正談得興高采烈，眞對不起，我要失陪了，因爲巳經到時間了」。</p>
<p>即將出發作戰的班員，說着便把身傍滿裝東西的旅行背囊輕輕地放在肩上，而動身走了。</p>
<p>三殺向敵人</p>
<p>把向所羅門出發的同事迭到門口的剩留報導班員，高聲談話着並非吉祥話的勉勵詞句，對方也忙於這種囘答，在一片笑聲裏，禿頭將囘原處的樣子，而對江戶中尉說：「那末，我給你講講松前少尉的武俠傳吧。」</p>
<p>江戶非常高興地說：「一定要請敎的。」（濤：議自東京朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>改進資材分配</h3>
<p>在現階段上，所謂增强戰力這句括的根本性格，就在於發揮現有總力的最高能率。在極有限的勞力與資材情况下，當然不容再有一點虛耗。各種資材，副資材的配給，切忌不適當而造成許多生產停頓，可是造船與產業的大部份，都有這種障碍，這眞是遺憾極了。資材的適當分配，應求之於生產計劃化。要求生產充沛均衡，那末須要有可以完全推動計劃生產的措置，這可說是先決條件。同時在配給方面，暫時可充分利用統制會，這是解決此項問題的比校簡易有效的方法。</p>
<p>統制會本身的使命，是在對於會員同業，作分配適時適量的資材，設法提高生產能率，這是它最重要的任務。</p>
<p>但是現在對於資材與製品的購買和分配，應該由統制會本身來辦呢？還是交給統一的配給機關來辦呢？把採辦資材與分配製品個別考慮呢，還是一起包括在經濟行爲之內呢？這些問題，都値得研究。總之，現在統制會的資材分配比率方法，實在尚不够完善，希望當局積極考慮，設法改進。（雲鵬譯自五月廿三日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>金融業註册截止後　財部無新核准</h3>
<p>關於金融機關註册開業事件，自上年八月二十日財政部公佈管理金融機關暫行辦法後，截止本年五月十五日爲止，所有銀行銀號銀公司錢莊等金融機關，經財部核准註冊給照者。</p>

<h3>糧食局　推進農產工作　調查農塲禁宰耕牛</h3>
<p>糧食局自接管本市兩農業改進區，及農林試騐塲以來，對於改進農業，增加食糧生產各項工作，刻已着手推動，查該農塲塲地，散在各處，事變後被人佔據甚多，糧食局現已令飭所屬，積極調查收回，以利增產，又該局因本市肉價高漲，一般無識農民，往往私宰耕牛，以謀厚利，致四鄉耕牛銳减，若不加以禁止，其於農業生產影響至鉅，該局有鑒於此，已經佈告四鄉，嚴禁宰殺</p>
<h3>經濟局繼續指定　三同業公會召集人</h3>

<h3>商統會與市商會之關係及其任務</h3>
<p>全國商統會之最下層機構新同業公會，定於五月底以前一律成立就緒，故刻正趕辦籌組事宜中。同時數十年來執華甲工商界牛耳之上海市商會，其任務已完全變化，今後之活動方針，頗爲各方所矚目，結果商統會與市商會之關係，宛如形影相連，預料市商會將以商工社會運動之地位而維持其組織。據最近之調查稱：上海市舊局業公會數達三百五十種之多，其中之重要者已全部作爲商統會之下層機構而重新組織竣事，凡與物資統制無關係之公會，並不列入商統會內，茲舉其證例若干如下：</p>
<p>（一）商統會外之同業公會不列入商統會機構下之同業公會，大多與工商業不生關係，至少，有極多數與工業無關係之公會，例如書店同業公會，文具業同業公會，典當業同業公會，三輪車出租業同業公會，人力車同業公會，旅館業同業公會，醫師業同業公會，理髮業同業公會等等具有商統會下層機構性質而新近誕生之主要商品同業公會，與不列入商統會機構下之各該公會相比校，則市商會今後所有之任務，其界限不　窺見。</p>
<p>（二）銀錢業公會與商統會市商會之關係　過去在市商會全盛時代，其所屬公會中，具有決定的支配力者，不用說得就是銀行公會，錢業公會，但商統會係以主要商品同業公會爲基礎，乃自治統制機關，如銀錢兩業金融關係公會，當然不直接加入其機構下，但商統會之理事長爲交通銀行總理唐壽民氏，理事爲華北金融界領袖周作民，中國銀行吳震修，銀行公會秘書長林康侯，大陸銀行葉扶霄，中國工業銀行許冠羣，華僑銀行陳水鯉，同潤錢莊裴雲卿諸氏，就其人事上觀之，顯見商統會與金融界已保持密切關係，聞商統會爲使此次關係更具體化起見，故考慮設一金融部門，因之，衆認銀錢業公會今後將由市商會中之主角地位，而轉爲商統會內之主角地位。</p>
<p>（三）市商會今後之活動　觀之上述所說，則市商會之今後情形，巳可想見。市商豐所有之任務，即爲工商社會團體性質之工作。例如喚起各同業公會之華北急賑運動等，並非商統會之任務，可謂係市商會之任務，結果市商會將成爲工商社會福利運動之中心。</p>
<p>關於市商會問題，租界工商界之見解，大體如下：</p>
<p>市商會之任務，必然變化，但不能認爲市商會之傳統消滅。新組織之商統會，亦可認爲是統制經濟時代之新市商會，蓋市商會爲商統會之母胎，故能作此說。民國以來工商業之發展及中國革命之推進上，　不有市商會之功績存在，推前思後，則統制經濟發展下所產生之商統會，確信其必能完成　大使命。（雲鵬：譯自五月二十五日大陸新報）</p>

        <h1>1943.05.26</h1>
<h3>A Discussion on Two Types of Pro-Japanese Factions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Tosuke Yoshida specially wrote a commentary for this newspaper titled "Two Types of Pro-Japanese Factions." He praised the first type of pro-Japanese faction, those who "sacrifice honor, which is more important than life, to seek a way out for the survival of the nation," whom he considers to be true Chinese patriots. He criticized the second type of pro-Japanese faction, those who "never had any honor to sacrifice from the beginning and are willing to do anything for money," who are the "traitors" bitterly hated by the general Chinese population. Mr. Yoshida's commentary is intended for Chinese readers, and from it, we can see the sincere opinions of a Japanese person who truly stands on a position of equality and friendship. We firmly believe that there are many Japanese friends who share Mr. Yoshida's love for both Japan and China, and who share his sentiments of admiring the first type of pro-Japanese faction and hating the second type. Standing on the position of promoting Chinese friendship, we find it necessary to further elaborate on this topic.</p>
<p>The prevalence of the term "pro-Japanese faction" has been around for decades. Whether the Japanese side truly understands it has always been a question. Often, due to policy needs at a certain time or a temporary gut feeling that a certain group is beneficial to Japan, they are labeled as a pro-Japanese faction and trusted, or efforts are made to elevate their status in various aspects of China without questioning their background or their true intentions. This seems to be the most common situation in the history of Sino-Japanese relations in the last two or three decades. The stories of Yuan Shikai, Zhang Zuolin, and others in the past, who were considered pro-Japanese factions, only served to increase misunderstandings between the two peoples and create unfortunate events for both sides. Amid these painful memories, we believe that there should be many people in the current Japanese authorities with the same understanding as Mr. Yoshida. In reality, there should only be one type of pro-Japanese, and that is the kind of person who truly loves China, understands Japan, and hopes to use Sino-Japanese cooperation to repel the common enemies of both countries. Because the motives of those who do not even love their own country are highly suspect, and it is foreseeable that they will not benefit Japan. Or even if they have the noble motives of loving their own country and being pro-Japanese, but in reality, they have no understanding of Japan, as Mr. Yoshida said, they only "know a little Japanese" and "cater to the preferences of the Japanese," then the result will certainly not be beneficial to Japan. Therefore, a true pro-Japanese person should be a true patriotic person, whose words, actions, wisdom, and consideration should protect their own country while also considering Japan, and who has the grand vision like Mr. Sun Yat-sen, who takes the overall interests of all Asians into account, and has the determination to struggle firmly regardless of their own personal fame and gain. Otherwise, all those who harbor temporary utilitarian psychology and only superficially embellish themselves will not have good results. Confucius said, "Observe what a man is aiming at, scrutinize his motives, take note of what brings him enjoyment. How then can he conceal what he really is, how then can he conceal what he really is!" This is what we hope Japanese people will be wary of regarding the so-called pro-Japanese factions.</p>
<p>On the Chinese side, there are certainly many of the first type of pro-Japanese faction that Mr. Yoshida praised. This is not only something to be congratulated on from Japan's perspective, but also something very gratifying from China's perspective. However, in reality, there are still many of the so-called second type of pro-Japanese faction, those who harbor personal gain and transform themselves into pro-Japanese factions, not only in the early stages of the incident but also at present. The appearance or words of such people are not worth paying attention to. What is important is what Zhuangzi said: "Listen to his words and observe his actions." Under calm observation, one can discover the truth. Precisely because their behavior is selfish and self-serving, their pro-Japanism is actually taking advantage of Japanese power, and they will not have any understanding or determination to share weal and woe with Japan. At the same time, they will not sincerely do their best for the country and the people domestically. On the contrary, they will take advantage of Japanese power to exploit their compatriots. Because they can do anything for their own selfish interests, they will certainly have no belief in the ultimate victory of Sino-Japanese unity, forming the defeatists we have criticized before. Therefore, their actions have tangibly and intangibly created unfavorable factors for East Asia and Sino-Japanese relations. Such people are "liars" in the eyes of the Japanese, so-called "traitors" in the eyes of the Chinese people, and criminals of East Asia from the perspective of the future of the world. In the decisive process of the Greater East Asia War and in the construction process of Greater East Asia, we should do our best to expose and eliminate such elements, especially by using propaganda and enlightenment movements to encourage people to expose them and urge these elements to become self-aware.</p>
<p>In the process of opposing the second type of pseudo-pro-Japanese faction, we will also be able to eliminate the misconceptions among the people caused by the blindly anti-Japanese faction. Based on their incorrect estimates and judgments of Japan, they regard the Japanese as the only enemy of the Chinese nation and conceal the real enemies. They also lump all those who advocate uniting with Japan to jointly strive for the independence and liberation of East Asian nations under the name of pro-Japanese faction, creating the slogan "pro-Japanese is a traitor" that has penetrated into the minds of the people. This has increased the misunderstanding between the Chinese and Japanese peoples and hindered the joint struggle of the two major nations. Today, we strictly distinguish between the false pro-Japanese faction and the true pro-Japanese faction, not only out of the great righteousness of the Spring and Autumn Annals of the Sages, but also for the eternal future of Sino-Japanese cooperation during and after the war. We must eliminate the second type of false pro-Japanese faction, and we must allow the true pro-Japanese faction who deeply loves their own country, Japan, and East Asia as a whole to eliminate the shadows left in the minds of the people by the blindly anti-Japanese faction with all the facts. Only in this way can we more effectively and more quickly strengthen the National Government internally, consolidate Sino-Japanese unity externally, and complete the great cause of East Asian national liberation.</p>
<h3>Important Correction</h3>
<p>In yesterday's commentary, "Two Types of Pro-Japanese Factions," in the fifth line, the sentence "is indeed very dangerous" was mistakenly printed as "is indeed not dangerous." Readers, please take note.</p>
<h3>Stalin's Feigned Injury Strategy</h3>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Communist International submitted a proposal to communist parties of all countries on May 22 to end the organization. Thus, an international organization once seen as a monstrous flood by countries around the world will cease to exist. In the first half of the twentieth century, this seems to be a noteworthy event.</p>
<p>Currently, under the rationale of the "new needs of the world situation," Moscow has issued the termination of the Communist International and relieved communist parties of all countries of their responsibilities and obligations to the International. The significance of this is tantamount to eliminating the leadership and connections of communist parties in various countries, and at least on the surface, it is a blow to communist activities in various countries. However, the practical significance today is that authorities in various countries have always considered the Communist International to be a tool of the Soviet Communist Party and government, and a base camp for the Reddening of the world, so it has become a fundamental factor in all conflicts between the Soviet Union and other countries. Especially since the outbreak of the Second World War, and especially since the outbreak of the German-Soviet War, the reason why the so-called anti-Axis countries have been contradictory, conflicting, and mutually restraining each other in recent years is mainly due to the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union, and the root of the conflict between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is precisely the existence of the Communist International in Moscow—the base camp for the Reddening of the world. Since the war began, Britain and the United States have never stopped anti-Soviet movements. Even the British Labor Party recently declared that merging with the communists would be tantamount to cutting off their future, which is nothing more than that. In reality, the thing that countries in Europe and other places fear most about the Soviet Union is the existence of this organization.</p>
<p>During the so-called two-ocean strategy conference conducted by Roosevelt and Churchill, in the period when the so-called "Second Front" was reaching a fever pitch, Moscow's sudden announcement of the end of the Communist International, in any case, must be said to be an astonishing concession by the Soviet Union to the British and American authorities. Why is the Soviet authorities willing to make such concessions? Although the underlying reasons are not clear, the most direct reasons and intentions are very obvious. First, the Soviet Union is currently facing the greatest concern, which is the peace movement in Europe. Once Britain and the United States make peace with the Axis powers, the blow to the Soviet Union will be fatal, and at that time, the so-called Communist International will naturally have no room for existence. Second, the excuse for Britain and the United States not to open a "Second Front" is that it would create an opportunity for the Soviet Union to Redden Europe. However, if the Soviet Union does not get the help of the "Second Front," it obviously cannot hold the winning hand. When we look at these two points, perhaps readers can understand why Stalin came up with this feigned injury strategy. Because after this feigned injury strategy is implemented, first, the peace movement in Europe loses its basis; second, Britain and the United States have no second reason to stay behind the scenes of the war. Therefore, what Britain and the United States will perform in Europe can be anticipated.</p>
<p>Of course, the end of the Communist International organization may also cause other side effects. First, will some neutral countries, especially Turkey, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, etc., whose reason for neutrality is opposition to the Soviet Union's "world revolution" plan, hesitate again? Second, many small countries in Europe, such as Finland, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the Balkan countries, the anti-Axis countries will inevitably take the opportunity to instigate, and their movements are also extremely noteworthy. As for the Axis countries, there is no denying that one of the motives for carrying out this war is to oppose the world Reddening plan. On the surface, the target of this war seems to have disappeared. In the eyes of people with shallow opinions, perhaps this is a great spiritual victory for the Axis countries. However, according to the German instructions, this move by the Soviet Union is obviously "deliberately mystifying." "Roosevelt can only maintain his policy of getting close to Stalin by this, and allow the Soviet Union to develop freely towards Europe." Therefore, in essence, it cannot be assumed that the end of the Communist International is the cancellation of the world Reddening plan. On the contrary, it can also be said to be a new development of Reddening activities, as the German foreign spokesman pointed out: "Stalin dissolved the Third International, but at the same time, he has established the Fourth International. Stalin once said that he would劃Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Finland, Norway, Sweden, etc., into its sphere of influence. Today, this move has further consolidated the ambition of this policy, that is, to establish Soviet regimes with different forms in these countries separately." This point should be the most valuable warning for the people of the Axis countries.</p>
<p>Stalin's feigned injury strategy has laid the foundation for the Stalin-Roosevelt-Churchill tripartite meeting, and at the same time, it has pushed the world war to a more serious stage. Its future evolution is worthy of our attention and vigilance.</p>
<h3>The Russo-Japanese War - Records from This Newspaper 38 Years Ago - Re-copied from Old Newspapers (6)</h3>
<p>Discussing with Guests the Japanese Purchase of the Kasuga and Nisshin Warships (From This Newspaper No. 1113, Guangxu 30th Year, Second Month, Twelfth Day, Western Calendar March 28, 1904, Monday)</p>
<p>A guest asked the writer: "The Japanese purchased the 'Kasuga' and 'Nisshin' warships from Argentina to prepare for a fierce battle with Russia in the vast sea. Now that the war has just begun, the two ships have already arrived with their wheels spinning. It seems that they can be incorporated into the fleet and rushed to the front. Why haven't we heard of any actions? Could it be that the two ships are worn out and fragile, not enough to resist the powerful Russia? Or are they afraid of suffering a setback and wasting a lot of money? What is the situation? Please explain it to me." The writer said: "These two ships, how could you easily suspect that they are worn out and fragile, not enough to be used? Examining Argentina, Xu Jiyu's Yinghuan Zhilüe calls it La Plata, also called Plata-e-ona (La Plata is the name of a major river). Xu Jiyu mistakenly used it to name the country. The country is located in the southern border of the Americas, with an area of 1,125,800 square miles, formed by the union of many small countries. It used to be a corner of Peru. In the Western calendar 1810, which is the 15th year of Jiaqing in China, the people all wanted to rise up and form their own country. It was not until the Western calendar 1822, which is the 4th year of Daoguang in China, that they were able to revolt and become independent from Peru. During the Tongzhi period, it fought with Brazil and Paraguay and lost. Since then, it has persevered in governing and all neglected matters have been revived. The national power has gradually increased. The government and education are modeled after the United States. The population is over 2,942,000. Annual revenue is about 9,070,000 pounds, and expenditure is only 9,040,000 pounds. Telegraph lines extend for 15,000 miles, and railways stretch for 3,300 miles. Although the territory is very small, its effects of wealth and power have gradually become apparent in the Americas. These two ships were sold to the Japanese. They were newly manufactured in British factories and cost as much as 1,500,000 pounds in British gold. The artillery, machinery, and equipment are all new. It is said that if you compare them with the largest and newest warships in Britain, no one can judge the price difference. Although Russia is called the lion of the continent, it will also retreat in the face of these ships. How can there be any worries about being worn out and fragile? Moreover, when the two armies meet, the loser is certainly in an irreparable state, and the winner is not necessarily unscathed. Since Japan has been at war with Russia at sea, many Russian ships have been damaged. The other day, a friend from Xiyou came out of Nagasaki and saw three battleships nearby that were damaged. All of these damaged ships, which one was not purchased with a lot of money? Since there is no reluctance to spend money, why are they alone reluctant to use the Kasuga and Nisshin ships and hide them deeply, not using them to perform maritime feats, letting 1,500,000 gold pounds be no different from treasures in a box? I know that the Japanese would never be so foolish." The guest said: "I have heard that according to international practice, once two countries start a war, neutral countries are not allowed to provide them with military equipment or warships. Does Russia accuse Argentina of this, so the Japanese cannot use them to fight?" The writer said: "That's not the case either. This time, the fighting in Incheon and Lushun took place on February 7th and 8th in the Western calendar. The Japanese court declared war on the 11th. If the Russians wanted to detain the two ships, they should have clearly informed the British when the Japanese court declared war. But they were slow to act and allowed the two ships to safely arrive in Japan on the 16th and be handed over to the Japanese. By this time, the British had no involvement at all, and everything should be up to the Japanese. How could the Japanese court be willing to obey the words of a powerful enemy and not include the two ships in the fleet? Then why haven't we seen them go to battle?" The writer said: "In my opinion, the two ships have just arrived in Yokosuka port. The artillery has not yet been fully deployed, the soldiers have not yet been properly assigned, and the boilers and rudders have not been tested properly. Therefore, they are cautiously delaying and are not willing to use them lightly to charge into battle. Although I am surprised why there is not a single word mentioned in the various daily newspapers. I think there must be some secret considerations, aiming for a victory in one battle, destroying the enemy's flames and boosting the national prestige. At this time, they are still hibernating in the military port. Once they advance straight ahead with the waves, people will be surprised like a flying general descending from the sky. The art of war says: 'Defend like a virgin, attack like a fleeing rabbit.' Is that what the Kasuga and Nisshin ships are about? You and I should be patient and wait quietly." The guest said: "Your words are not without insight." Then he bowed to the writer and left.</p>

<h3>Return of the Kulangsu International Settlement - France, Spain, Sweden and Denmark All Express Agreement - Administrative Rights of the Settlement Can Be Fully Recovered - Joint Communiqué Issued Yesterday by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Publicity</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Publicity issued a joint communiqué at 2:00 PM on May 25th as follows: The return of the administrative rights of the Kulangsu International Settlement, which was first advocated by our friendly nation of Japan, a portion relating to Japan having been received by our nation on March 30th of this year, the third anniversary of the return of the National Government to the capital. As a result of subsequent negotiations with related nations, such as France, Spain, Sweden, and Denmark, agreement has been reached with them. The recovery of the administrative rights of this settlement can therefore be fully implemented.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Publicity issued a joint communiqué on May 25th stating that regarding the administrative rights of the Kulangsu International Settlement, France, Spain, Denmark, Sweden, and other countries have all agreed, and the return can be implemented. What is worthy of our attention is that even Sweden, which has always been conservative and neutral, has expressed its deep agreement to this. From this, it can be seen that the normal diplomatic relations between China and Sweden are being restored. After the return of the National Government to the capital, the number of countries that have recognized our government and restored diplomatic relations has reached as many as fourteen. The position of our government in the international community has clearly become increasingly elevated.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Chu Issues Statement</p>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the recovery of the administrative rights of the Kulangsu International Settlement, as a result of negotiations between our government and related countries such as France, Spain, Sweden, and Denmark, agreement has been reached, and full implementation is imminent. Minister Chu issued the following statement on this matter: Kulangsu, after the opening of commercial ports, was due to the intentional aggression of Britain and the United States, resulting in the establishment of an international settlement, which has lasted for more than forty years. It echoes the Shanghai International Settlement from afar, becoming a stronghold of British and American aggression in southern China, greatly hindering our nation's autonomous development. Our nation has long wanted to recover it, but due to the complexity of the relationships, there has been no way to start. Therefore, although the British concession in Xiamen has been recovered, the Kulangsu International Settlement has maintained its old state until today. After our nation entered the war this year, our friendly nation of Japan, in the spirit of righteousness, immediately signed an agreement with our nation to return the settlements and abolish extraterritorial rights. Regarding the exclusive Japanese settlements, all of them were returned on March 30th of this year. Regarding the administrative rights of the Kulangsu International Settlement, a portion related to Japan was also received by our nation on the anniversary of the return to the capital, along with the Japanese settlements in various places. As for other related countries, such as France, Spain, Sweden, and Denmark, as a result of negotiations, they also recognized the situation in East Asia and understood our nation's determination to recover it, and have expressed their agreement one after another. Therefore, the administrative rights of this settlement can be fully implemented and recovered. The return of the Kulangsu International Settlement has progressed smoothly thanks to the lead taken by our friendly nation Japan, and has achieved reasonable implementation. Our nation expresses heartfelt gratitude for this kind of enthusiastic assistance from the Japanese government and the goodwill assistance of other related countries. Our nation has international settlements in Kulangsu and Shanghai. Although the land regulations and administrative rules are slightly different, they are both strongholds of aggression by the powers, especially Britain and the United States, in China. In order to achieve autonomous development and actively complete the construction of a new order in East Asia, our nation cannot allow this kind of special state to continue to exist. Now, because the related countries have a deep understanding of the new situation in East Asia, they have recognized our nation's recovery one after another, so that the historical stronghold of British and American aggression in East Asia, that is, the settlement, can finally be completely received by our nation, which has profound significance. After this recovery, the rights and interests of friendly countries in that area will naturally be respected, their merchants will be carefully protected, and their well-being will be improved.</p>
<h3>Commander-in-Chief Hata Returns to Nanjing After Inspecting the Central China Front Lines - Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Military Dispatch in China Press Office announced on May 25th: Commander-in-Chief Hata, after inspecting the central China front lines, returned to Nanjing on the 24th. The Commander-in-Chief issued a statement regarding the progress of this inspection, the gist of which is as follows: I went to the central China front lines to inspect the combat situation of the Japanese army. I witnessed the strong fighting spirit of the unit commanders and soldiers, and I was extremely gratified. In this operation, four divisions of the Chongqing army were first annihilated on the shores of Dongting Lake, and five divisions of the Chongqing army were crushed in the area west of Gongan, achieving great results. This was all due to the brave fighting of the soldiers. The operational area is mostly a zone of large rivers, lakes, swamps, and mountains. Therefore, the Japanese army soldiers were able to overcome all topographical difficulties, which truly demonstrated the success of their usual training and was sufficient proof of the high morale of the Japanese army. Regarding the cooperation of the operational air squadron, it fully exerted the effect of land-air coordination, which greatly contributed to the results of the battle. I am also deeply grateful for the close cooperation of the navy. In this operation, the troops on the side of the National Government were able to assist in the operation in many ways, which is also worthy of celebration. The Japanese forces in North China have reaped remarkable achievements in the Taihang Mountain operation this spring. In Central China, this summer offensive operation has inflicted a heavy blow on the Chongqing army. In short, the fighting spirit of the Chongqing army is extremely low. This is evidenced by the repeated great results of the Japanese army and the surge in the number of Chongqing prisoners. I deeply feel that the combat strength of the Chongqing army has significantly decreased compared to when I took office three years ago. Recently, Pang Bingxun led his troops to surrender, and the people are deeply able to understand the sincerity of the Japanese army, and they assist the Japanese army in all aspects. Such facts can all be said to indicate that the anti-Japanese situation in Chongqing is trending towards collapse. The heavy blows inflicted on the Chongqing army by the Japanese army in North China and Central China are certain to further shake the Chongqing anti-Japanese camp. I recently inspected the rural pacification work in Zhenjiang and the Jiangbei area, and saw that great results have been achieved. Recently, the rural pacification work mechanism has been reformed with great effort. In view of the experience of the past two years, I believe that this is a very appropriate measure. However, it goes without saying that the Japanese army will continue to actively cooperate in operations and security in the future.</p>
<h3>Successful Opening of the Yangtze River Waterway: Japanese Flagship Arrives at Shashi, Ensuring River Transport and Traffic</h3>
<p>Shashi, 25th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Navy Yangtze River Unit's operation to open the Yichang waterway concluded on the 24th, and the Japanese Navy flagship sailed into this area on the 25th. A staff member of the Japanese Central China Fleet, speaking on the flagship, described the operation, stating that it was aimed at breaking through the Chongqing side's river defenses to clear mines and other underwater obstacles from the approximately 180-li stretch of the Yangtze River mainstream leading to Shashi, and to open the waterway. This operation not only secured river transport and traffic for the Japanese military but also inflicted a heavy blow on the first stage of the offensive against Chongqing's interior. The work of clearing mines laid by the Chongqing forces was extremely difficult, but all Japanese soldiers exerted their utmost efforts, wading through the turbid currents, secretly searching, and clearing them, determined not to leave a single one behind. This required utmost caution. Despite the Chongqing forces' stubborn counterattacks, the Japanese soldiers overcame all difficulties, endured all sacrifices, and worked diligently, their efforts truly deserving of gratitude. Previously, the Chongqing forces, deeply fearing a Japanese offensive from the river, laid a large number of mines and obstacles in key areas upstream of Chenglingji and stationed troops to guard the riverbanks and maintain strict surveillance. They also loaded hundreds of mines onto civilian ships stationed at various locations along the riverbank, ready to lay them at any time. However, recently, as Japanese army units launched operations in Mianyang and on the south bank of the Yangtze River, the Chongqing forces in the Xiangbei triangle area and the area along the south bank of the Yangtze River had been cleared, and a large number of unlaid mines were captured by the Japanese military. At the same time, the Japanese Navy, in coordination with the army's operations, overcame all difficulties and opened the waterway to Shashi in one fell swoop, making it easier to carry out waterway work between Shashi and Yichang and enabling it to be opened quickly when necessary. All of this demonstrates that the Japanese military's offensive will continue until the Chongqing forces' base is completely destroyed. Therefore, the Chongqing side, confident in its defensive capabilities, is deeply anxious about this. Since the Chinese National Government announced its entry into the war, Chongqing's reliance on the British and American position has become even more dangerous. Therefore, it has engaged in extensive propaganda, claiming that Japan's military strength in the South Pacific, India, and Burma has been depleted and that Japan's fighting power has been greatly reduced, and making boastful claims that the anti-Axis alliance will surely achieve final victory, all of which is nothing more than wishful thinking. Japan has ample resources both at the front and in the rear. The Japanese military has achieved brilliant victories in various theaters of war in Greater East Asia, and the construction work in the occupied territories is proceeding smoothly, with war preparations fully underway, which even the enemy must acknowledge. In particular, the activities of the Japanese military in China have become more intense, and the wavering of the Chongqing forces' morale is difficult to conceal. Therefore, the opening of the Yangtze River waterway by the Japanese military is like a dagger pointing directly at the heart of the Chongqing forces. Moreover, the opening of the Yangtze River waterway to Shashi will further facilitate the flow of materials in Hunan and Hubei provinces, which will contribute greatly to China's revival and the people's livelihood. A large number of civilian ships have already begun to transport materials, and the general public, under the protection of the Japanese military, is able to live and work in peace. In short, the significance of this operation is extremely important, and it is sufficient to consolidate the foothold for the future offensive against Chongqing. This is also of great importance in Japan's handling of the Chongqing issue.</p>
<p>Shashi, 25th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Yangtze River Fleet has advanced upstream and arrived at Shashi during this operation. The supreme commander of the Japanese Navy Yangtze River Unit, aboard a certain flagship, landed at the Shashi naval pier at 10:00 a.m. on the 25th to meet with the commander of the army unit and express gratitude for the army's cooperation in this operation. The army side also praised the navy unit's achievements. They conversed for about an hour before returning to the ship.</p>

<p>Hankou, 25th (Central News Agency) – The Hunan military front-line authorities announced that the Japanese military had occupied Mianyang, the base of the Chongqing 86th Army, at noon on the 24th (30 kilometers south of Yichang). Shanghai News from Central News Agency – The Japanese Central China Fleet Press Department announced at 2:00 p.m. on the 25th that the Japanese naval unit, in close cooperation with the army unit, had continued to carry out the operation to open the Yichang waterway since April 15th, and had quickly opened the 177-li waterway between Yuezhou and Shashi on May 24th with very few casualties. In addition to ensuring its safety, the following results were achieved: 186 mines and 146 landmines were disposed of, 13 machine guns and 975 rifles were captured, and 135 rounds of various ammunition were seized. The Japanese side suffered only one small boat sunk, three soldiers killed, and nine soldiers wounded.</p>

<h3>Guangzhou Bay Uses Central Reserve Bank Notes</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 25th (Central News Agency) – After the Japanese military entered Guangzhou Bay, silver coins and enemy currency denominated in old legal tender continued to circulate in the market. The Japanese military authorities, in view of this, decided to replace military scrip with Central Reserve Bank notes in the area, in order to assist the circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes, based on the spirit of joint defense between Japan and Vietnam. This matter was announced on the 25th for public awareness. These Central Reserve Bank notes have become the only basic currency in the Central China and South China peace areas, with their credit increasing daily and their circulation area expanding daily. Since April 1st of this year, after the issuance of new military scrip was suspended, the status of Central Reserve Bank notes has become even more consolidated, and they have been widely circulated in various places. Therefore, the action of replacing military scrip with them in the area has taken place.</p>

<h3>US Supreme Commander of Cebu Island, Hachisaka, Has Surrendered; Understanding the Meaning of Prime Minister Tojo's Visit to the Philippines; Willing to Actively Cooperate in Building a New Philippine Island</h3>
<p>Cebu, 25th (Central News Agency) – The security in the Visayas region has improved due to the Japanese military's active suppression and pacification efforts. Lieutenant Colonel Hachisaka, "Supreme Commander of the Southern Region" of the US remnants, surrendered to a certain unit of the local Japanese military engaged in suppression on the 10th, along with his son and nephew, Second Lieutenant Bayernan Farfa, radio technician Second Lieutenant Rosario, and nine other officers. After the outbreak of the war, the lieutenant colonel engaged in resistance due to being misled by enemy counter-propaganda. Since September of last year, the Japanese military has used the southwestern part of Cebu Island as a center, contacted various islands in the Visayas region via Radio C station, and continued to stir up trouble. Now, due to the Japanese military's thorough sweep, the radio station has been completely taken over, and their guerrilla tactics have been broken. Moreover, after the lieutenant colonel surrendered to the Japanese military, he was well treated. The Japanese military is currently treating his gunshot wounds. Out of gratitude, the lieutenant colonel has realized the futility of resistance and decided to work hard to build a new Philippine Island after he recovers from his injuries, in order to repay the Japanese military's kindness.</p>
<p>Cebu, 25th (Central News Agency) – Enemy Cebu Island Supreme Commander Lieutenant Colonel Hachisaka surrendered to the Japanese military on the 10th of this month and is currently receiving kind treatment at a certain army hospital. He expressed his deep gratitude. The following is Lieutenant Colonel Hachisaka's written oath to build a new Philippine Island: "My heart is filled with infinite gratitude. I am now able to preserve my life, share food and lodging with my eldest son, Joiru, and receive the kind care of the Japanese military, which was far beyond my initial expectations. I was extremely grateful to hear that Prime Minister Tojo himself inspected the Philippines. At a time when Japan is actively cooperating in building a new Philippine Island with such enthusiasm, Filipinos, misled by American counter-propaganda, have betrayed their motherland. Looking back on everything in the past, I am deeply ashamed. What we most hope for has been confirmed by Prime Minister Tojo. Although we blindly continued to resist in the past, we now understand the meaning of Prime Minister Tojo's visit to the Philippines. At present, we must make the general public aware of Japan's true intentions. I have the responsibility to alleviate the people's suffering. To achieve this mission, I am determined to stand up and build a new Philippine Island under Japanese guidance."</p>

<h3>Director of the Valley of the River News Department Delivers Speech in Yokohama</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) – According to Yokohama telephone, Major General Tanioki, Director of the Army Press Department of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, delivered a speech at the Yokohama Public Hall at 7:00 p.m. on the 25th, entitled "The United States and Britain Are Not To Be Feared But Not To Be Despised Either." The following is a summary of the main points: The United States is the backbone of the enemy camp, and Britain and Chongqing rely on the United States to continue their extremely bleak operations. The United States once promoted that productivity, manpower, and time are the three elements of victory. I now intend to review these three points to explain the reason why "the United States and Britain are not to be feared but not to be despised either" and why the Axis powers can surely achieve final victory. It is well known that the United States possesses the world's resources and the most excellent production facilities. Therefore, it is also a fact that the United States boasts its military production capacity with astronomical figures. However, its actual production is only 60% of the quantity it boasts, due to the shortage of certain materials and the lack of smooth distribution and transportation. Taking the shortage of rubber as an example, 90% of the rubber in the United States has always been supplied by the occupied territories of our country in Greater East Asia. The current rubber reserves in the United States are about 400,000 tons. The amount obtained from Central and South America and Africa is at most only tens of thousands of tons, and the domestically remanufactured rubber is about 200,000 tons. The annual demand in Britain is about 800,000 tons. Therefore, the existing rubber can only be used for one or two years. Therefore, the United States is currently working hard with the goal of producing 400,000 tons of synthetic rubber annually, but its work has not progressed as desired. Mineral resources such as iron, tin, manganese, aluminum, sharp, mercury, and mica are also in short supply. In addition, I would like to add that the United States is finding it particularly difficult to obtain quinine. The area near Bandung, Java, is famous for producing quinine, accounting for 98% of the world's production. Since the area was occupied by our army, the United States and Britain have been unable to obtain quinine, resulting in rampant malaria in the country, which cannot be prevented, and has developed into a serious problem. Currently, many soldiers in the American expeditionary forces in Solomon and New Guinea are also suffering from malaria, and many have died from lack of medicine. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the United States has been working hard to expand military production, increasing it by about three times compared to before the war. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the number of workers, but it is doubtful whether skilled workers can quickly increase three or four times. Moreover, the military supplies produced, in addition to being used by hundreds of troops in various places, must also be supplied to Britain according to the Lend-Lease Act. Moreover, the United States and the Soviet Union want to complete their so-called "arsenal of democracy" mission. Therefore, the weapons they produce are not entirely used to deal with Japan, and only a small number of them are used to deal with Japan. Moreover, if the United States wants to completely use it to deal with Japan, it must be safely and reliably transported to the Greater East Asia theater and distributed to the front-line troops, and it must be used tactically. The spatial, temporal, and tactical relationship is what Japan wants to use. The British and American soldiers, lacking training, are driven to engage in a war with no daily goals, and they often boast of battles that satisfy their curiosity, adventurousness, and heroism. This is extremely bad. Therefore, the annihilation of countless American soldiers by our army is also a deserved retribution. Secondly, regarding manpower, last year, U.S. Army Chief of Staff Marshall and Chairman McNutt of the Manpower Mobilization Committee said that the U.S. Army is about 9 million people. According to the current total population of the United States of 140 million people, if men and women each account for half, then 9 million people account for exactly 1% of the total number of American men. The number of 9 million people is also not small in the United States. Moreover, behind each soldier, there are related military workers and farmers. According to the U.S. statistics during the First World War, the ratio was one to ten. According to this ratio, if you want to support 9 million troops, then the general labor force is 90 million people, which happens to be the entire working-age population of the United States. Therefore, even if the rear production is completely rationalized and mechanized, it is not an easy task. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Navy Soul (2): Sea Eagle</h3>
<p>— Yoshio Shimizu</p>
<p>Although we don't easily talk about the lofty Navy soul, I would like to respectfully ask a very respectable Sea Eagle. "It's not a question of the superiority of the aircraft, but of the difference in spirit. The state of mind when rushing into the dazzling barrage of bullets, putting life and death out of the question, seems that anyone, as long as they are used to this situation, can do it." I looked at the large bandages on his hands and feet and comforted him for his injuries, and wished him martial prowess, but he said: "Alas. I'm really ashamed. I haven't gained martial prowess, nor have I established any achievements. I'm really a useless person."</p>
<p>His purity, bravery, caution, and that courteous attitude always made me naturally and wholeheartedly respect him every time I met him.</p>
<p>Most people only begin to reach a state of detachment at the age of seventy or eighty, but he was already very cultivated at the age of twenty. Thinking of the physical and mental training he underwent before coming to this place made me have to sit up straight and feel a sense of respect. (Taotao: from Daily News)</p>
<h3>The Naval Battle of the Sea of Japan and the Pacific Naval Battle (1)</h3>
<p>— Tominaga Kenwa</p>
<p>(I) Under the Z Flag</p>
<p>The 38th Naval Memorial Day, the second one during the Greater East Asia War, is fast approaching. The Z flag, prominently displayed on the flagship Mikasa, is once again fluttering in the Pacific winds.</p>
<p>The great victory of the Naval Battle of the Sea of Japan, along with the decisive victory of the Fengtian Battle on March 10th, together served as the conclusive end to the Russo-Japanese War. It is a wellspring of historical memories for the Japanese people, and its significance is even greater when compared to the current war situation.</p>
<p>The Russo-Japanese War was a fierce counterattack in the final stage of the tide of Western European white people invading the world. It stopped the ambition of Western European white people, caused world history to begin to reverse, and was a victorious record of a just protest against white aggression.</p>
<p>The Russo-Japanese War was also the first victory record in modern history of colored people against white people. For centuries, the Asian peoples, who had been colonized and enslaved through oppression and abuse, reached the dawn of liberation due to the influence of the Russo-Japanese War. It also caused a comprehensive awakening of colored people around the world.</p>
<p>The Russo-Japanese War, at the beginning of the 20th century, marked a major turning point in modern world history.</p>
<p>The Russo-Japanese War fundamentally reformed wars that had always been centered on Europe and the United States, and also comprehensively revised Western European strategic thinking.</p>
<p>The Naval Battle of the Sea of Japan resulted in the complete annihilation of an enemy fleet superior in both quality and quantity, and can be called an unprecedented victory in the history of world naval battles.</p>
<p>Therefore, Japan dared to challenge American capitalist imperialism, which had a history of maritime power, and the seeds of the fated opposition between Japan and the United States were sown in this battle.</p>
<p>(II) The Conflict of World Policies Among the Great Powers</p>
<p>The Russo-Japanese War was in fact the inevitable result of the great powers' Pacific policies after the Sino-Japanese War, so this war cannot be said to be merely a conflict between Japan and Russia.</p>
<p>At that time, Germany and France regarded Russia as a friendly nation, while Britain and the United States supported Japan. The reason these two countries supported Japan was not to make Japan win an absolute victory in order to subdue Russia, but only to assist Japan within the scope that was beneficial to the expansion of their own interests.</p>
<p>Only ten years after the Sino-Japanese War, Japan demonstrated strength in the Russo-Japanese War that exceeded the expectations of the world's great powers and achieved a glorious victory. However, in the great victory of the Fengtian Battle, the problem of war was that 20th-century warfare, which was essentially a thorough war of attrition, would shift to an unsustainable war of attrition.</p>
<p>During this period, the raising of war funds was extremely difficult, national power was about to be exhausted, and the war still had to be continued. Therefore, the all-or-nothing Naval Battle of the Sea of Japan arose in order to determine a victory or defeat. As a result of this battle, the Baltic Fleet was completely destroyed, and the arrogant Russian government completely lost its confidence and hope in controlling the sea in the Pacific.</p>
<p>In this way, the Portsmouth Treaty was held through the mediation of the President of the United States.</p>
<p>(III) The Source of the Next War</p>
<p>Here, what is most noteworthy is that the United States, which had been extremely friendly since its founding and continued to maintain a pro-Japanese attitude during the war, did not support Japan. This was because the United States did not want either Japan or Russia to become too powerful. We do not need to treat Roosevelt as a benefactor, nor do we need to complain about his cunning attitude. That is just common sense in the international community.</p>
<p>The Russo-Japanese War was not merely a matter of the interests of Japan and Russia, but a reflection of the interests of all the great powers that insisted on world policies. The conflict of the great powers over Pacific policies is by no means limited to interests centered on the Pacific. This has been the case in the past, it is the case now, and it will not change in the future.</p>
<p>The Russo-Japanese War ended, and the entry of the United States into China gradually became blatant. As a result, the future of the emerging Japan, the victor of the Russo-Japanese War, was filled with thorns. From the history of the Russo-Japanese War, it was already seen that the Pacific issue of the Russo-Japanese War would be a problem between the victor and the mediator of the war.</p>
<p>Historical facts clearly tell us that Roosevelt appeared to propose a Russo-Japanese peace out of humanitarianism, but in reality, it was to open up the way for the United States to enter China.</p>
<p>On the Pacific issue, the future of the relationship between Japan and the United States is determined by the victory of the Naval Battle of the Sea of Japan. At the end of that year, the Japanese people had already recognized which direction the preparation for the next war should take, and at the same time, the United States had also clearly recognized the relationship between the two countries.</p>
<p>The Open Door Policy is essentially a weapon for invading East Asia, and its ambition is specifically aimed at Japan. Is this something that people should deeply consider? (Sho: Translated from "Modern" No. 5)</p>

<h3>All Flour Mills Preparing to Operate Fully; Flour and Wheat Special Committee Purchases Wheat for Centralized Distribution to Mills as Raw Material</h3>
<p>The Flour and Wheat Special Committee of the National General Association for Commercial Control, in view of the fact that wheat is beginning to appear on the market in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, has, for the sake of unified purchase and centralized distribution, borrowed huge sums of money from Chinese and Japanese banks, such as China, Jiaotong, Shanghai, Jin Cheng, Zhong Fu, etc., as well as Japanese merchants Zhengjin, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, etc., to purchase wheat. The Japan Flour Milling Federation, China Flour Industry Federation, and Grain Industry (Wheat Group) Federation, which belong to the committee, purchase wheat in different regions according to the assessed prices of wheat in various production areas. The wheat obtained is centrally distributed to various flour mills for flour production. It is reported that wheat harvests in various places this year have been abundant, and the quality of the harvest is rare in recent years. Recently, Shanghai Fu Feng, Fu Xin, Hua Feng, as well as Wuxi Tai Feng, Guang Feng, Qishu Yan Cheng Yu, Nanjing You Heng, and San Xing, Mitsubishi, Zhenjiang, Dong Fu, Tai He, Mitsui, Hua You, etc., are about to fully resume operations to produce flour to meet the needs of the entire people's food supply. It is also reported that the Special Committee has specially established a Wheat Section to handle the collection, purchase, and distribution; a Transportation Section to handle transportation and warehousing; an Improvement Section to handle inspection and research; a Factory Section to handle engineering and material supervision; and a Flour Bran Section to handle sales and other matters.</p>

<h3>Self-Defense Corps Substitute Duty Must Apply to Jia Head; No Hiring Allowed Without Bao Head Approval</h3>
<p>It has been investigated that the hiring of substitutes for duty by the Self-Defense Corps has long been prohibited by the Baojia authorities. However, recently there are still some citizens who knowingly violate this rule. The Baojia authorities yesterday specially posted notices again in various Baojia districts, reiterating the previous order. Anyone who wants to hire someone to substitute for duty must apply to the Jia head in advance, provide legitimate reasons, and the person requested must be a Self-Defense Corps member of the same Baojia and qualified age as the applicant, and the applicant must not give any monetary reward to the substitute. The Jia head must submit the application to the Bao head for approval and provide appropriate proof, so as not to violate the law. If anyone privately hires someone with money to substitute for duty, once found out, both the hirer and the hired will be subject to the punishment of having their citizen certificates revoked.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents Commemorate Navy Day With Grand Program Today and Tomorrow; Group Tomb Sweeping and Labor Service Today; National Defense Contribution Public Assembly Tomorrow</h3>

In addition, about 3,500 students from the first and second higher girls' schools and girls' commercial schools will carry out labor services and cleaning operations. Also, because tomorrow is the Navy Day, related societies and organizations are actively preparing for tomorrow's grand program today. There are many celebration programs. Starting in the early morning, the Shanghai Women's Association will solicit donations on the streets to be used for national defense purposes. About 5,500 fifth-grade students from each national school will visit the Izumo warship to see the lives of the soldiers on the ship.

<h3>Municipal Schools Adjust School Names, Cancel "Special Zone" Label</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Education Bureau took over the Municipal Special Zone Normal School and the Municipal Special Zone He'an and Feihong primary schools, as well as the Municipal Special Zone various People's Schools, which were organized by the former Education Committee, in order to standardize the names of municipal schools, the words "Special Zone" in the names of the schools are no longer applicable and are all uniformly cancelled. The names of all relevant schools in the city have been adjusted, and the original Shanghai South District Normal School has been changed to the Municipal First Normal School, and the Special Zone Normal School has been changed to the Municipal Second Normal School. In addition, the original municipal First People's School to Eighth People's School in the old urban area are merged with the Special Zone First People's School to Twentieth People's School and changed to the Municipal Ninth People's School to the Municipal Twenty-eighth People's School in order to connect them and avoid confusion, and this method has been reported to the Municipal Government for record.</p>
<h3>Filial Piety and Sincerity Movement</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Baojia Youth Corps, in order to promote the inherent Chinese virtues, has recently launched the "Filial Piety and Sincerity Movement". The basic principles of this movement will be widely publicized by the personnel of the Youth Corps. Last Sunday, the group held short speeches in various theaters in the city. At the same time, it is also learned that students from middle schools in the Public Concession will also be invited to participate in this publicity and will set an example in order to promote the meaning of filial piety and sincerity.</p>
<h3>Residents Purchasing Household Rations Do Not Need Epidemic Prevention Certificate</h3>
<p>Regarding the rumor that it is necessary to have an epidemic prevention certificate to purchase household rations, the Datong News Agency reporter recently learned from inquiries in the two concessions and the western districts of Shanghai that this is not true. It is said that the authorities are indeed working hard to carry out epidemic prevention injections and encourage residents to implement them, but so far, it has not been stipulated that an epidemic prevention certificate is required when purchasing rations. In fact, residents of each household often send one person as a representative to purchase rations. If it is necessary to submit an epidemic prevention certificate for inspection, the procedures will be inconvenient, and in fact, it is not enough to prove whether the presented epidemic prevention certificate is indeed owned by the ration purchaser.</p>
<h3>Scientific Crime-Solving Charts to be Applied in Police Stations</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department Police Department, in order to make it easier to investigate and solve all crimes, will apply a new type of scientific chart format, specializing in detailed facial drawings, including face, eyes, ears, nose, lips, eyebrows, forehead, hair, etc. These charts were completed only yesterday and will be distributed to police stations for application starting next week. According to its statement, after the application of these charts, it can help solve crimes that occur in this city.</p>
<h3>Rice and Grain Joint Venture Has Been Organized; Free Trade is Pure Nonsense</h3>
<p>Recently, the saying that various rice shops will freely sell rice after the cancellation of household rice has been raging. According to the Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry with the Rice and Grain Distribution Office, the above rumor is not true. Moreover, since the implementation of household rice, the results have been excellent. Starting from today, the seventh phase of household rice will be handled. Each rice shop will pay the Public Works Department to receive a purchase order, which will be announced soon. In addition, the Shanghai Rice and Grain Joint Venture, which is being prepared by Lu Wenshao, has been organized and is located at 606 Pudong Building. It is now starting to collect membership fees. It is said that the collection of membership fees is based on capital. Those with capital of 20,000 yuan or more pay 200 yuan, those with 50,000 yuan pay 400 yuan, and those with more than 50,000 yuan pay 600 yuan. There are more than 3,000 rice shops in the two concessions.</p>
<h3>The City's Press Corps Visited the Izumo Warship Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tomorrow (the 27th) is the Japanese Navy Memorial Day. The City Press Federation specially launched a joint press visit to the Izumo warship yesterday (the 25th) afternoon at 3:00 PM, sponsored by the Japanese Navy Fleet Reporting Department. At 2:40 PM, the entire group gathered in the conference room on the third floor of the Fleet Reporting Department on the Bund. More than 100 people, including responsible persons, editors, and reporters from the Central News Agency and various newspapers, attended. First, Lieutenant Shiotani explained the history of the Izumo warship and the visiting procedure, and set off to visit at 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>Captain Murayama Gave a Welcome Speech</p>
<p>Arriving on the ship, everyone suddenly felt refreshed. The captain of the ship, Colonel Murayama, delivered a speech, roughly saying: "I am very happy to welcome you to visit this ship. You rarely have the opportunity to visit warships. Today, please take a detailed look at it. There will also be a demonstration of the use of artillery and a performance of various Japanese martial arts. Now, please start your visit."</p>
<p>Visit Artillery Practice and Equipment</p>
<p>The press corps was divided into three classes, led by officers of the ship. First, they visited the artillery practice. For a time, the sound of bugles and orders shook their eardrums. There are a total of ten cannons on the ship, including two main cannons in the front and rear, and three auxiliary cannons on the left and right. Each cannon is controlled by electricity and is quite sophisticated. The reporters followed the leaders in turn and visited the spiritual instruction sign, shrine, captain's room, dining hall, kitchen, medical room, sick room, living room, small workshop, etc. They had a clear view of the Japanese navy's hard living and rigorous training.</p>
<p>Daily Life and Martial Arts Performance</p>
<p>Daily life consists of worshiping at the shrine at 6:00 AM, scrubbing the deck, having breakfast, resting for an hour, sweeping the inside of the ship at 8:15 AM, training from 9:45 AM to 11:45 AM, gymnastics at 1:00 PM, training from 1:15 PM to 3:30 PM, Japanese martial arts for one hour at 3:45 PM, tidying up the inside of the ship at 8:15 PM, and the deputy captain inspects at 8:45 PM, after which the whole body goes to sleep. The reporter group then went to the land barracks to watch the performance of Japanese martial arts, including wrestling, bayonet fighting, etc., with shouts of killing, vivid and colorful, and the performance was realistic. They saw the energetic, full-bodied and strong-bodied Japanese naval soldiers. After the visit, they returned to the ship for rest and refreshments.</p>
<p>Press Representative Gives a Thank You Speech</p>
<p>Finally, Xu Liqiu, the acting president of Zhonghua Daily, represented the whole group and gave a thank you speech, saying: "Today, I am deeply honored to be invited to visit the Izumo warship of the Japanese invincible navy. I have witnessed the ship's comprehensive equipment, sophisticated weapons, serious training, and the hard work and endurance of the officers and soldiers. I am even more impressed in my heart. From the Russo-Japanese War to the current Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Navy has been able to annihilate the enemy in one fell swoop and achieve victory, which is by no means accidental. I still remember that during the Russo-Japanese War, when Japan defeated Imperial Russia, the Father of the Nation was in Europe and personally saw the shock of the European countries when they heard the news of Japan's victory. At that time, Britain and Japan were allies. When they heard that the allied countries had won, they should have felt excited. However, at that time, London only shook their heads and frowned. Today, the Greater East Asia War has broken out, and we have embarked on the broad road of practicing the great work of revitalizing East Asia. Since the war, the friendly navy has exerted its invincible power and has achieved unprecedented victories known to the world. We, standing in the position of journalists, must work hard and responsibly to awaken the people to take the friendly navy as a model and work hard to complete the war. We are able to see the prestige of the Japanese Navy two days before the Japanese Navy Memorial Day, and we are honored to be invited. On behalf of the colleagues in the press, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Captain Murayama, Lieutenant Shiotani, and all the officers of the Izumo warship." After the speech, the reporter group said goodbye and went ashore to return.</p>

<h3>Elementary School Student's Parent Rude; Teacher Dies of Anger</h3>
<p>According to a letter from Sacred Heart Elementary School at 393 Pingliang Road, the school hired female teacher Su Yizhi as the homeroom teacher this semester. She was very popular with the children on weekdays. On the 19th of this month, during a calligraphy lesson, more than ten students in the whole class were punished by the teacher (Su Yizhi) for not being attentive. However, one student, Liu Zhijun, whose father's name is Liu Runsheng, was dissatisfied with the punishment and reported it to his mother after returning home. Unexpectedly, his mother, Mrs. Liu, ran to the school, without asking the facts, scolded the teacher, and slapped her twice in the face. Miss Su was a weak woman, so she had to swallow her anger and dare not argue with her. Mrs. Liu took an inch and went to the school to make trouble and scold her again a few days ago. Teacher Su was repeatedly humiliated while performing her teaching duties and was extremely angry. The next morning, she died of anger. Now, Su's family has reported to the Yulin Road police station. The police station sent the deceased to the mortuary for examination and arrested and questioned the student's mother, Mrs. Liu. Miss Su has no parents and is a lonely woman.</p>
<h3>Robbery of Anhe Wheel Case; One Bandit Boat Intercepted</h3>
<p>On the 18th of this month, the Anhe Wheel, which sailed from Xingang to Shanghai, was forced to stop by more than 30 bandits carrying weapons near Wuxu Port at 11:30 AM. Passengers were robbed and part of the cargo was unloaded into a small boat prepared by the bandits. The Japanese shipowner was kidnapped and the bandits planned to flee. The special service squadron of the Huainan Self-Defense Corps stationed in Xinshiqiao heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, engaging in a fierce battle with the bandits. The bandits were defeated and abandoned their ship, fleeing. One bandit was killed on the spot, and one bandit boat was intercepted. The captain of the ship was able to escape danger. The Huainan Corps is now strictly ordering its subordinates to search for the remaining bandits.</p>

In the second game, Fire Youth defeated Olympic with a score of 2-0. In the last game of Group A, French Concession Police played against the Soviet Union. The battle between the two sides was extremely tense and full of highlights. The Soviet Union worked hard and took the first set with a score of 23-21. The French Concession Police were unwilling to give in and quickly caught up. They unexpectedly won the next two sets with scores of 21-17 and 21-18 under a losing trend, and finally defeated the Soviet Union with a score of 2-1, reversing the defeat. They won the Group A championship with a record of four wins, and Donghua ranked second with three wins and one loss.</p>

<h3>Izumo Cruiser Inspection: A Record of Distinguished Service in the Russo-Japanese Naval Battle</h3>
<p>— Han Ru</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 25th) at precisely 3:00 PM, a large gathering of colleagues from the Shanghai press unfolded within the conference room of the Japanese Naval Attaché’s Office on the Bund. Reporters from major newspapers filled the hall, preparing to depart for an inspection of the Izumo cruiser.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Shiota's Speech</p>
<p>Lieutenant Shiota of the Navy, dressed in a neat summer white uniform, delivered a speech on behalf of the naval authorities to all the reporters. From his words, we learned about the history of the Izumo and its distinguished war record. The Izumo is an old hero of the Japanese Navy. It has served on the front lines over thirty times and was only struck by two twelve-inch shells from the enemy during the Russo-Japanese War, with only three soldiers killed. Otherwise, it remained completely undamaged. To this day, it still bravely maintains the military achievements of thirty-eight years ago, floating on the Huangpu River, with the commander's flag flying high at the masthead in the May breeze, like a guardian of the Yangtze River. During the last European war, it sailed into the Mediterranean, establishing immortal feats. In between, it also visited London, the capital of England, to participate in a regatta, winning a championship certificate.</p>
<p>A Tour Around the Ship</p>
<p>On board the ship, we met the courteous and refined Captain Murayama Kiyoroku, a Navy Captain. He is the forty-ninth captain of the Izumo. The first captain was Navy Captain Inoue Toshio. Captain Murayama warmly welcomed the visitors with an attitude of sincerity and elegance.</p>
<p>Another officer told the visitors about the daily life and routine of the crew: They rise at 6:00 AM, and the captain leads them in a remote worship of the Imperial Palace. After that, they wipe and wash the deck, have breakfast, and clean the interior from 8:15 to 9:30 AM. From 9:45 to 11:30 AM, they receive training. At 11:30 AM, they have lunch. At 1:00 PM, they do exercises and begin afternoon training until 3:30 PM. From 3:45 to 6:00 PM, they train in Kendo, Judo, and other Japanese martial arts. After dinner, they rest. At 8:15 PM, they begin tidying up the interior. At 8:30 PM, the executive officer inspects the entire ship, and with that, the day's routine ends.</p>
<p>The tour group was divided into three groups, and they toured the entire ship separately. The crew directed the soldiers in a demonstration of shell firing, the operation of the main guns, and explained the entire ship's layout in great detail.</p>
<p>At a certain dining table, we saw a group of soldiers eating. The food consisted only of a bowl of white rice, two or three kinds of salted vegetables, and one kind of vegetable, with a bowl of tea soup. It was very simple.</p>
<p>The officers' lounge was decorated elegantly. A radio was broadcasting songs from the shore.</p>
<p>In the training room, a scene of basic Japanese naval training unfolded. Kendo and Sumo were being practiced in groups. The soldiers were earnestly training under the leadership of their officers. It is with this kind of continuous and intense training that the Japanese Navy defeated the old Russian fleet, destroyed the British and American Pacific fleets, and became the guardian of the Eastern Pacific.</p>
<p>The late Admiral Togo's handwritten instructions, "Loyalty, Courtesy, Valor, Integrity," are hung in the cabin. This is the highest goal of Japanese naval spiritual training.</p>
<p>Rome was not built in a day, and the formation of the strong Japanese Navy was not achieved overnight. We hope that the Chinese Navy will catch up as soon as possible to fulfill its responsibility of jointly protecting East Asia with allied nations.</p>
<p>Naval Battle Thirty-Eight Years Ago</p>
<p>The Izumo is a 10,000-ton cruiser that was launched in the 34th year of Meiji (43 years ago, i.e., 1900). In the Russo-Japanese War, it was the flagship of the Second Fleet in the Battle of the Sea of Japan (1904-1905), actively participating at sea. The Battle of the Sea of Japan, from May 27th to 28th, 38th year of Meiji, established the most glorious pyramid of victory in naval warfare history, shattered the ambitions of Tsarist Russia, completed the defense of East Asia, and laid the foundation for today's construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. It was a great historical naval battle. In this naval battle, the one who decisively determined the victory or defeat was none other than Admiral Togo, the commander of the Combined Fleet, whose order for "turning towards the enemy" fully demonstrated the essence of the Japanese Bushido spirit of "cutting flesh and severing bones." Admiral Togo's operational decision astonished military experts worldwide.</p>
<p>At dawn on May 27th, the patrol boat Shinano Maru telegraphed the flagship Mikasa, reporting the discovery of the Baltic Fleet. The Combined Fleet then notified the headquarters: "Upon receiving the alert of the enemy fleet's discovery, the Combined Fleet immediately set out, intending to reduce the enemy fleet. The weather is clear today, but the waves are rough. With unwavering faith in victory, we silently departed from the Chinhae Bay base. Learning that the enemy Baltic Fleet was about 10,000 meters south of the port side, we urgently turned the course to the southwest in the opposite direction. The speed of the Japanese fleet was fifteen knots, and the speed of the Baltic Fleet was ten knots. The two fleets gradually approached the battlefield at a rate of 800 meters per minute.</p>
<p>Turning Towards the Enemy</p>
<p>At 2:05 PM, the distance between the Japanese and Russian fleets was reduced to 8,000 meters, approaching the effective firing range of twelve-inch guns. At this time, Admiral Togo (later Marshal), the commander of the Japanese Combined Fleet, was on the bridge of the flagship Mikasa, calmly assessing the opportune moment for battle with his staff. He suddenly raised his right hand and drew a semicircle to the left. Rear Admiral Kato, the chief of staff, smiled slightly and nodded in agreement. This was the unprecedented ninety-degree turn in front of the enemy, the new T-shaped battle tactic. In any naval battle, making a sharp turn in front of the enemy is the most dangerous move for our fleet, providing the enemy with a good target for artillery fire. Therefore, admirals of ancient and modern times have avoided using it. However, Admiral Togo, despite seeing the enemy's large fleet with superior guns in front of him, still resolutely implemented the bold tactic of changing course, further pressing the enemy's first fleet to the east, unleashing a fierce and accurate barrage of gunfire, and winning a great victory that will be forever immortalized in the history of world naval warfare.</p>
<p>Therefore, this well-thought-out tactic is ultimately unimaginable for armchair strategists. Military experts around the world call this operation the Togo Turn and are studying this tactic in depth, which is indeed very worthwhile.</p>
<p>Second Fleet Flagship</p>
<p>In this Battle of the Sea of Japan, which unfolded the fate of East Asia, the warship Izumo, participating as the flagship of the Second Fleet, had Vice Admiral (later Admiral) Kamimura Hikonojo, known for his bravery, as its commander, and Captain (later Vice Admiral) Ichiji Kiharu, known for his strategy, as its captain. During the attack, it was the seventh ship of the Combined Fleet.</p>
<p>When approaching this superior enemy at a close range of about 1,600 meters, in the artillery battle, the Izumo was struck by two twelve-inch shells from the enemy, resulting in three deaths, seven serious injuries, and eleven minor injuries. In such a large-scale artillery battle, having only this amount of sacrifice can be said to be divinely aided. One of the two twelve-inch shells hit the officers' quarters, causing a fire, which was immediately extinguished by the officers and soldiers, and they continued to fight. The other penetrated the starboard side and flew into the coal bunker. Because it did not explode, the damage was still minor. The commander of the Second Fleet, Vice Admiral Kamimura, was directing the fleet on the compass bridge when an enemy ricochet (a shell that bounces up again after falling into the water due to physics) passed over the vice admiral's head, showing the intensity of the artillery battle.</p>
<p>In the Battle of the Sea of Japan, the fighting was so fierce, yet the damage sustained was so minor. As a result, the Japanese people seemed to believe that the Izumo was always protected by the Izumo Shrine and praised it as the "unsinkable ship."</p>

<h3>Sighing at the Sight of a House</h3>
<p>— Xiao Min</p>
<p>It is embarrassing to say that I was born here, grew up here, and live here, a citizen of the Republic of China, yet I am far inferior to the White Russian refugees who have wandered to Shanghai, and not even comparable to the Jewish refugees who have been expelled to Shanghai. They have no nationality, and they are all exiles who have been driven out. However, when they first came to Shanghai, the British and Americans of the former concession authorities, mindful that these exiles were also fair-haired, blue-eyed, and high-nosed, fearing that it would undermine the dignity of their white race, specially planned and provided them with residences and accommodations. As a result, these exiles, relying on the latent power of the British and Americans, were able to engage in various hoarding and speculation, manipulating the market, and miraculously transformed into arrogant expatriates on the sea. Looking back at us, the genuine owners of this land, there are more than just thousands who cannot even find a place to rest!</p>
<p>More than a year ago, although the two concessions had regulations on housing rentals and established housing dispute mediation committees, it did indeed shock those speculative second landlords and had some small effects. However, as time passed and things became stagnant, the formal disputes did decrease to the point of becoming invisible, but in essence, the means by which the second landlords squeezed and oppressed the third tenants became increasingly varied.</p>
<p>I remember once seeing in the classified ads in the newspaper the repetitive request for "elegant co-tenancy, limited to two married couples, address inquiries to a certain mailbox, will arrange an interview if suitable," etc. So, with a mind to give it a try, I wrote a letter. After a few days, there was a "response," an "arranged interview." So I went to the address. I was received by the second landlord's wife. Upon meeting, she said many things about the reasons and conditions for renting out the room, the main reason being that she felt "lonely" and wanted to find a tenant to "keep her company" and incidentally "supplement" her income. I made two declarations: first, I am a legitimate employee and do not engage in speculation; second, I want to rent for a long term because it is not easy to find a house and move around in this day and age. She replied that it would definitely not be a problem. Fortunately, with all the conditions met, my wife and I were finally welcomed as guests, thinking that we could settle down and live in peace from then on, or at least live for a year or two. However, the trends of the world are changing daily, and the mentality of the second landlord is no exception. After we had lived there for only a few months, the second landlord's wife used the excuse of "taking it back for her own use" and asked us to find another house. She also mentioned how much the key money was for this house, how much the key money was for that house, and how the previous tenant had helped her with some small speculative deals, etc. The unspoken meaning was obvious. Because of the difficulties of the times, we were already spending a lot of effort and energy running around all day for food, clothing, housing, and transportation. How could we have any remaining energy to be at someone else's beck and call? Therefore, in addition to agreeing to automatically increase the rent, we politely declined her offer, relying on the two declarations we had made. When we first came, she was doing her best to express her welcome and enthusiasm, but now she was doing her best to express her hatred and dislike. Recently, she has even become more aggressive, running over every two or three days to pester us incessantly. She had been kind enough to find us a small room nearby, but it could not accommodate our furniture, and the rent was beyond our means. She forced us to move out, thinking that as long as we moved out of her door, she would not care whether we lived or died. Because of her daily urging, we could only repeatedly ask relatives and friends for help, forwarding introductions, and searching for clues in the rental columns of the newspaper every morning. If there was a suitable house, we would go to the address to look for it. Only one or two of them were not available. It took a few months to find a small room for rent, but we had to pay key money, or even a handling fee, of several thousand to as much as one or two million, and we could only live there for a year or two. If we wanted to rent the entire building, a common house in the French Concession, it would cost no less than forty or fifty thousand, and there would be no transfer of ownership, so as to avoid interference from the main landlord. Similar disguised demands, although there are imperial prohibitions, how can they affect the slightest hair of the powerful second landlords? As for the third tenants, if they want to rent a house, they can only grit their teeth and bear the pain to rent it. But how can an employee in a salaried class like me have this idle money to pay key money! Logically, in this extraordinary period, the owner or second landlord should not refuse the tenant by pretexting "taking it back for their own use" or "inconvenience of serving," and the tenant can also refuse to move out. But in the same doorway, seeing each other morning and evening, seeing the unpleasant look on the second landlord's wife's face makes one feel very afraid, and hearing her harsh words every two or three days makes one feel very uncomfortable, wanting to move to a better place as soon as possible. Therefore, in these recent two or three months, every morning on the way to the office and every evening on the way back, seeing those various, tall, short, large, and small houses, I always stop and look up, hesitating for a long time before sighing, thickening my face, humbling myself, and dragging my heavy steps back. When entering the door, I am afraid of meeting the face of the second landlord's wife, so I can only tiptoe up the stairs before I feel relieved. The fact is in front of my eyes. On the one hand, I cannot find a house, and on the other hand, the second landlord's wife is urging me with harsh words, leaving me helpless. My current situation is even far worse than that of the White Russians and Jews!</p>

<h3>Anecdotes of the Japanese Navy (3)</h3>
<p>— Oshita Uda'er</p>
<p>(4) Submarine No. 6</p>
<p>Compared to airplanes, the history of submarines is longer. Lieutenant Hino's first flight in a Grade Monoplane was in the autumn of the forty-third year of the Meiji era, but in April of the same year, there was already the story of Sakuma Tsugunaga. The submarine No. 6, which is now located at the submarine school, began construction at the Kobe Shipyard in November of the thirty-seventh year of the Meiji era and was completed in April of the thirty-ninth year. Prior to this, the Japanese Navy had several foreign-made submersible boats.</p>
<p>But these were, of course, rudimentary submarines. It was not until the forty-third year of the Meiji era that oxygen welding technology was first used. In that year, Lieutenant Shirase took the Kainan Maru to explore Antarctica. Vice Admiral Kamimura Hikonojo was promoted to Admiral, Natsume Soseki was awarded a doctorate, and Tanaka Hozumi and Uesugi Shinkichi were simultaneously awarded doctorates. But at that time, although there were submarines, they had not yet participated in actual combat. It was said that French submarines could reach a speed of eight knots per hour. The Japanese newspapers solemnly reported on it, and its performance could be roughly inferred. There is also a very interesting story about this.</p>
<p>During the Russo-Japanese War, in the waters of Port Arthur, the flagship Petropavlovsk, carrying Vice Admiral Makarov, was sunk by a mine, and the vice admiral and all his staff drowned. At that time, the crew on board did not think it was a mine, let alone that the Japanese Navy had submarines, and thought it was a strange object floating on the sea, so they fired at it, resulting in such a result. After this incident, when the Russian Baltic Fleet sailed all the way from Europe to the East, the commander-in-chief, Vice Admiral Rozhestvensky, became nervously pale. The information he received was that Japanese submarines had already participated in actual combat, which caused great concern due to false reports.</p>
<p>In the First European War, the activities of German submarines were extremely meritorious.</p>
<p>As a result, Japan, after much research and sacrifice, buried itself in hard work and made improvements, while also striving to train the crew.</p>
<p>People in the Navy regard the spirit of the late Commander Sakuma as the representative of submarines and their crews. At the same time, submarines are also progressing day by day, with specialized scientists pouring out all their knowledge. Even outsiders often have groundbreaking fantasies.</p>
<p>Submarines discover enemies and attack them.</p>
<p>Using a periscope to glimpse the entire situation, before being discovered by the enemy, they launch torpedoes at it.</p>
<p>This is truly not the work of humans, but the work of gods. In order to make miracles a reality, training must be carried out. How amazing it would be if, without using a periscope, one could accurately understand the enemy ship's situation in hundreds of feet of water! As for its secrecy, it also increases significantly with the increase in diving depth. If a powerful submarine could be built that could dive to a depth of 2,000 meters below the surface, the face of naval warfare would probably turn into a guerrilla war.

<h3>Dispatch (1)</h3>
<p>— By Navy Reporting Unit Member, Hiroshi Hamamoto</p>
<p>1. Flowers and Roads</p>
<p>Lieutenant Junior Grade Kantaro Eto, assigned to the torpedo boat, finally received the commendation from the commander a few days ago. As a ship with military achievements, Eto excitedly rushed to the front-line base in the South Pacific to see her. However, the important ship had unfortunately sailed and was not in port. He felt very disappointed, but there was nothing else he could do. He had to wait for the return of the boat in the temporary accommodation in the headquarters compound.</p>
<p>The local rainy season had just passed, and it was the most pleasant time of the year with clear skies and sunshine. However, he had suddenly jumped out of the severe winter in the mainland, and here he was encountering the sweltering heat where he was sweating profusely.</p>
<p>A flower bed crossed the wide lawn in the courtyard. Along both sides of the road, various flowers and plants were appropriately placed. There were deep red single-petal flowers, and also pinkish-red eight-petal flowers. Mixed among them were very precious bellflowers, which bloom throughout the year.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Junior Grade Eto happened to meet his middle school classmate, Tadayuki Matsumae, on this flower-lined road.</p>
<p>Eto had just arrived and was wearing a snow-white uniform, while Matsumae was wearing a neat marine uniform with the insignia of a second lieutenant in the reserves, holding a leather-covered military sword, and swaggering along. Whether in his red eyes or on his sunburnt cheeks, he was full of the atmosphere of the battlefield.</p>
<p>"Ah!"</p>
<p>Matsumae couldn't help but shout out due to this chance encounter.</p>
<p>"Are you here too?"</p>
<p>Eto didn't even know that Matsumae was serving in the navy before. Although the two had met unexpectedly, their pleasantries ended there.</p>
<p>Because Eto was a second mate graduate of a higher merchant marine school, he originally had the qualifications of a reserve officer, but Matsumae, because he graduated from the law department of the Imperial University, voluntarily applied to be a naval reserve student, so he was only a reserve second lieutenant. The so-called reserve officers in the navy were those who had received formal officer education at a military academy or engineering school, such as Eto and Matsumae. Reserve officers did not have cherry blossoms on their cap badges and collar badges, but only a compass emblem.</p>
<p>In a corner of the lawn was a pile of shrubs with yellow flowers. Further ahead, you could see red-roofed bungalows. Instead of calling them bungalows, it would be more appropriate to call them barracks, as high as a bed.</p>
<p>Matsumae looked at that side and asked, "Do you still remember Matsugoro Nanjo?"</p>
<p>"I remember, but is he here too?"</p>
<p>He was a fellow townsman and a classmate two grades above him in middle school. He heard that he was a news reporter in Tokyo recently.</p>
<p>"He is stationed here as a member of the reporting unit. He is now a senior veteran in this field and has a good reputation. That is the dormitory of the reporting unit. If you go to see him now, he will definitely be there."</p>
<p>Upon hearing this news, Eto, being new and without any acquaintances, wanted to visit, so he said, "Take me there!"</p>
<p>But Matsumae refused and replied, "The staff are calling me. Go by yourself and give him a surprise!" After taking two or three steps, Matsumae suddenly turned around and asked, "Where is your unit?"</p>
<p>During this time, the rumbling of domestic bombers resounded in the sky. Watching them fly overhead in large formations, as if dazzled by the sky, Matsumae said, "Look, can you still hear the naval march from the mainland?" He embarked on the journey.</p>
<p>"That's strange! When did they come?"</p>
<p>Reporting unit member Matsugoro Nanjo was still sitting on a stool on the veranda in shorts, enjoying the cool, but he asked in a very friendly and amiable manner. He took off the dark scarf wrapped around his head and welcomed him very courteously, saying, "Oh, please sit down! Would you like to take off your upper garment?"</p>
<p>There were three or four other people sitting on the same stool, some were young men wearing only shorts, and some were wearing summer shirts with painful expressions on their faces. Their eyes were all focused on Eto. Because his sleeve badge was dyed with a blue background and a red pattern like the character "report," everyone thought he must be a colleague of Nanjo's in the reporting unit.</p>
<p>It seemed like a meeting was going on, so Lieutenant Junior Grade Eto was a little restrained and said politely, "Maybe I'm disturbing you! If you have time, I'll come again. I live in the dormitory across the street because it's very close." But he didn't seem to want to sit down.</p>
<p>"It's okay, it's okay! Sit down!" The very kind Nanjo grabbed him and said, "This man is about to leave for battle, so everyone is here to bless him. It's perfect, Eto-kun, you also participate in this farewell party! Okay?" After discussing with the others, he introduced his old friend from his hometown to everyone.</p>
<p>"Of course, welcome, please sit down!"</p>
<p>Some even stood up to offer their seats, so Lieutenant Junior Grade Eto sat down with everyone.</p>
<p>The man who was about to leave for battle first presented his business card as a greeting. The business card was printed with "Navy Reporting Unit Member," and in the corner was printed the name of a newspaper different from the one Nanjo served for.</p>
<p>Because his old friend from his hometown was visiting, Nanjo seemed a little embarrassed, so he poured water for everyone back and forth very diligently. While taking out ice-cold beer from the expensive electric refrigerator, which made a motor sound, from a corner of the veranda, he explained with a smile, "This refrigerator is by no means a luxury item. Because it is a necessity for the photography unit, we temporarily borrow public equipment to store beer and canned goods, etc."</p>
<p>Eto asked the departing unit member, "Where are you going?"</p>
<p>The other party, who had a side parting and wore glasses, said, "Going to the Guadalcanal area," and then replied briskly that he was also going to the neighboring area.</p>
<p>Guadalcanal, which had become an island of bloody battle between enemies and allies a long time ago, is still the front line where the death struggle continues.</p>
<p>Eto said admiringly, "The gentlemen of the reporting unit are also working hard!"</p>
<p>While trying to pour beer for Eto, the other party replied softly, "Not at all, not at all, we can't produce any results."</p>
<p>Just then, Nanjo, who had returned to his position, asked Eto, "Speaking of Guadalcanal, but did you meet Matsumae-kun?"</p>
<p>Eto said with great interest, "Matsumae told me where you lived, but what is the relationship between Guadalcanal and Matsumae?"</p>
<p>Nanjo pointed to the fat-headed, big-eared baldy beside him and said, "Oh, there is a big relationship. Matsumae has displayed martial arts-like legends in the forests of Guadalcanal. Ask him! He was there at the time."</p>
<p>"I am very sorry to excuse myself, because the time has already arrived."</p>
<p>The unit member who was about to depart for battle said as he lightly put the fully packed travel bag on his shoulder and left.</p>
<p>3. Killing Towards the Enemy</p>
<p>The remaining reporting unit members, who had seen off their colleague who was heading to the Solomon Islands, spoke loudly and encouraged them with non-auspicious words, and the other party was busy with this kind of reply. Amidst the laughter, the baldy turned back to his original place and said to Lieutenant Junior Grade Eto, "Well, then I will tell you about Lieutenant Matsumae's martial arts legend."</p>
<p>Eto said very happily, "I must ask for instruction." (Tao: Discussed from Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<h3>Longevity Celebration Helps the Distressed</h3>
<p>Luo Yingjun wrote in a letter: "Now that my late father is celebrating his 80th birthday, relatives and friends have sent gifts. In addition to returning a portion, there are still 300 yuan in gift money that cannot be returned. At this time of world change, with displacement on the road, I respectfully follow my father's wishes and donate the money to support orphaned children. I believe that my relatives and friends love me, so they will extend their kindness to my children. With such a small contribution, I dare to hope it can become a fur coat. I am somewhat hesitant. How can I celebrate a person's life like celebrating the life of the world?" (Note: The money has been received and will be distributed to Fuyou Orphanage, Youyou Jiaoyang Chu, and Children's Welfare Association, 100 yuan each. Thank you.)</p>

<h3>Improving the Allocation of Resources</h3>
<p>At the current stage, the fundamental nature of the phrase "strengthening combat power" lies in maximizing the efficiency of existing total power. Under extremely limited labor and resources, there is naturally no room for further waste. The allocation of various materials and auxiliary materials should avoid being inappropriate and causing many production stoppages. However, most of shipbuilding and industry have this obstacle, which is extremely regrettable. The appropriate allocation of resources should be sought through production planning. To demand sufficient and balanced production, there must be measures that can fully promote planned production, which can be said to be a prerequisite. At the same time, in terms of allocation, the control association can be fully utilized temporarily, which is a relatively simple and effective method of solving this problem.</p>
<p>The mission of the control association itself is to allocate timely and appropriate materials to member companies, and to find ways to improve production efficiency. This is its most important task.</p>
<p>But now, should the purchase and allocation of materials and products be handled by the control association itself? Or should it be handed over to a unified allocation agency? Should the procurement of materials and the distribution of products be considered separately, or should they be included together in economic activities? These issues are worth studying. In short, the current material allocation ratio method of the control association is not perfect. It is hoped that the authorities will actively consider and find ways to improve it.

<h3>No New Approvals from the Ministry of Finance After the Deadline for Financial Industry Registration</h3>
<p>Regarding the registration and opening of financial institutions, since the Ministry of Finance promulgated the Interim Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions on August 20th of last year, the deadline was May 15th of this year. All financial institutions such as banks, silver firms, silver companies, and money shops that were approved by the Ministry of Finance for registration and licensing were:</p>
<p>267 in Shanghai and 161 in other places, totaling 428. As for the financial institutions in North China, since the North China Political Affairs Committee promulgated the Rules for the Management of Financial Institutions in December of the 30th year, as of December of last year, there were 85 in the city of Beiping and 230 in the city of Tianjin.</p>
<p>There were a total of 315 in Pingjin. However, the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Hubei are vast and Nanjing is the capital. Shanghai is the financial center. The total number of financial institutions in other places is only over 400, which is not many. Looking back to December 18th of the 31st year, the Ministry of Finance issued a statement restricting the establishment of new financial institutions in Shanghai, stating that except for those specially approved due to special circumstances, no new establishments would be allowed. Therefore, after December 18th of last year, those in Shanghai who newly applied to the Ministry of Finance for registration were generally rejected, and there were no new financial institutions specially approved for establishment. However, those who had applied to the Ministry of Finance for registration before the aforementioned deadline, because their proposed articles of association and all procedures were still lacking, were still under review, and were subsequently approved for registration after being supplemented and corrected according to the approval, resulting in a later opening. In addition, there were some money shops that were originally partnerships and had been operating for many years, but had never applied for registration and licensing. It was not until August of last year that the Ministry of Finance approved the extension of the deadline to reorganize as companies, and they gradually reported the reorganization. However, due to the time required to convene shareholder meetings, change the articles of association, and increase capital, the approval registration has not yet been completed. However, Shanghai newspapers occasionally publish advertisements for various financial institutions that have received ministerial licenses and officially opened on schedule. Outsiders who are not aware of the content are easily misled. In fact, the aforementioned financial institutions were not newly established after being approved by the ministry after the registration deadline.</p>
<h3>Shanghai District Collection Bureau of Income Tax Compiles a Register of Merchants</h3>
<p>In order to rectify tax collection, the Shanghai District Collection Bureau of the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance was ordered to compile a register of income tax merchants. Collection offices were instructed to send personnel to factories, merchants, and companies in their respective districts to investigate their business status, capital situation, and whether they were paying income tax in accordance with regulations. The investigation was limited to be completed before the end of June of this year. In the future, the register of merchants compiled will be used as the basis for collecting income tax. After the investigation, the bureau will issue an income tax investigation certificate for the merchants to keep for future reference. The items to be filled in for the income tax merchant register are: (1) Compilation number (2) Commercial brand name (3) Address and house number (4) Manager (5) Capital amount (6) Date of establishment (7) Number of employees and salaries, etc.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Determines the Standard Price of Spring Cocoons</h3>
<p>The fresh spring cocoons of this year's spring season in the production areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have already entered the market one after another. The purchase standard price of all spring cocoons has been determined by the Ministry of Industry convening a meeting of sericulture stakeholders. The reeling ratio of 380 catties is determined as 1,829 yuan per dan (market scale), 2,253 yuan per dan (Sima scale). The reeling ratio of 402 catties is determined as 1,654 yuan per dan (market scale), 2,038 yuan per dan (Sima scale). The reeling ratio of 450 catties is determined as 1,544 yuan per dan (market scale), 1,902 yuan per dan (Sima scale). It is learned that the newly established China Silk Industry Co., Ltd. in the city has sent personnel to Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Wuxing, and other places in Zhejiang Province to purchase fresh cocoons in accordance with the official price. As for the spring cocoons in various production areas of Jiangsu Province, such as Wuxi, the company also plans to send personnel to purchase them in the near future.</p>
<h3>Food Bureau Promotes Agricultural Production Work and Investigates Farms Banning the Slaughter of Ploughing Cattle</h3>
<p>Since taking over the city's two agricultural improvement zones and the agricultural and forestry experimental farm, the Food Bureau has begun to promote various tasks to improve agriculture and increase food production. After investigation, it was found that the farm land was scattered in various places and was occupied by many people after the incident. The Food Bureau has now ordered its subordinates to actively investigate and recover it to facilitate increased production. In addition, due to the high meat prices in the city, ignorant farmers often slaughter ploughing cattle privately in order to seek huge profits, resulting in a sharp decrease in ploughing cattle in the four townships. If this is not prohibited, it will have a huge impact on agricultural production. In view of this, the bureau has issued a notice to the four townships strictly prohibiting slaughter.</p>
<h3>Economic Bureau Continues to Appoint Conveners of Three Trade Associations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Economic Bureau has reportedly finalized the initiators for the city's three trade associations, including glass factories. The list of conveners is as follows: (1) Zhou Wenmei, Glass Factory Trade Association, (2) Zhang Lianfang, Hardware Store Trade Association, (3) Zhang Jiaxiang, Metal Wire and Silk Trade Association.</p>
<h3>The Relationship Between the Commercial Control Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and its Tasks</h3>
<p>The lowest-level organization of the National Commercial Control Association, the new trade association, is scheduled to be established by the end of May. Therefore, preparations are being rushed. At the same time, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which has been the leader of the Chinese industrial and commercial circles for decades, has completely changed its mission. Its future course of action is attracting much attention. As a result, the relationship between the Commercial Control Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is like a shadow, and it is expected that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will maintain its organization in the position of industrial and commercial social movement. According to a recent survey, there are as many as 350 old trade associations in Shanghai. The important ones have all been reorganized as lower-level organizations of the Commercial Control Association. All associations that are not related to material control are not included in the Commercial Control Association. Here are some examples:</p>
<p>(1) Trade associations outside the Commercial Control Association Most of the trade associations not included in the Commercial Control Association are not related to industry and commerce, or at least a large number are not related to industry. For example, the Bookstore Trade Association, the Stationery Trade Association, the Pawnshop Trade Association, the Tricycle Rental Trade Association, the Rickshaw Trade Association, the Hotel Trade Association, the Physician Trade Association, the Barber Trade Association, etc. Compared with the main commodity trade associations with the nature of lower-level organizations of the Commercial Control Association and newly established, the scope of all the tasks of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in the future can be glimpsed.</p>
<p>(2) The relationship between the Silver and Money Industry Association and the Commercial Control Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce In the past, during the heyday of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the associations under its jurisdiction that had decisive control were, needless to say, the Banking Association and the Money Industry Association. However, the Commercial Control Association is based on major commodity trade associations and is an autonomous control organization. Therefore, the financial-related associations such as the Silver and Money Industry Association will not directly join its organization. However, the chairman of the Commercial Control Association is Tang Shoumin, General Manager of the Bank of Communications, and the directors are Zhou Zuomin, leader of the financial circles in North China, Wu Zhenxiu of the Bank of China, Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Banking Association, Ye Fuxiao of the Continental Bank, Xu Guanqun of the China Industrial Bank, Chen Shuilu of the Overseas Chinese Bank, and Pei Yunqing of the Tongrun Money Shop. Judging from the personnel, it is clear that the Commercial Control Association has maintained close relations with the financial circles. It is heard that the Commercial Control Association is considering establishing a financial sector in order to make this relationship more concrete. Therefore, it is generally believed that the Silver and Money Industry Association will transform from the protagonist in the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to the protagonist in the Commercial Control Association in the future.</p>
<p>(3) Future activities of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Judging from the above, the future situation of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce can be imagined. The task of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is the work of an industrial and commercial social group. For example, calling on various trade associations for the North China Relief Movement is not the task of the Commercial Control Association, but can be said to be the task of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. As a result, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will become the center of industrial and commercial social welfare movements.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the views of the industrial and commercial circles in the concession are generally as follows:</p>
<p>The mission of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will inevitably change, but it cannot be considered that the tradition of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has been eliminated. The newly organized Commercial Control Association can also be considered a new Municipal Chamber of Commerce in the era of controlled economy. Because the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is the mother of the Commercial Control Association, it can be said that there is no small contribution from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in the development of industry and commerce and the promotion of the Chinese revolution since the Republic of China. Looking forward and backward, it is firmly believed that the Commercial Control Association, which is produced under the development of the controlled economy, will be able to complete its great mission.
