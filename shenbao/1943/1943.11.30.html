<h3 id="c1">論日本新聞事業的發達 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>「公理之筆，與正義之劍，共同為祖國與東亞而戰鬥！」這是日本今日報業之基本立傷。</p>
<p>日本的新聞從業人員，數年來無時不在犧牲奮鬥之中，而且是在統一團結的奮鬥之中。我們為着新聞業前途的進展，有硏究日本及學習日本新聞事業的必要。</p>
<p>日本新聞事業的歷史，正是日本由維新至强盛時代的一面鏡子，而且這面鏡子，永遠是與日本之維新與强盛分裂不開的。</p>
<p>日本之有近代化的報紙，遠在明治以前的文久二年（一八六二年），首先是翻譯來自爪哇方面的荷蘭語報紙而由西書商人萬屋兵四郞發行的「巴達維亞新聞」。至於創作的日本報紙，則首推明治元年（一八六八年）二月明治新政府最初的官報「大政官日誌」（京都），及幕臣柳河春三等主辦的「中外新聞」（江戶），翻閱當時日本史，可知日本的報紙，是在國內不安達於絕點而維新運動在全國發動之際誕生的。從此以後，日本新聞事業逐漸在國家人民共同要求之下為維新與文明而奮鬥，初期報紙中最著名的便是明治三年十二月在橫濱誕生的日本第一張日報「橫濱每日新聞」，（為「東京每日」之前身），明治五年五月誕生的「新聞雜誌」，和明治五年誕生的「東京日日」。「日新眞事誌」。「郵便報知」等。這五種報紙報為日本初期五大報，最初都有御用新聞之目，直到後來因征韓論而發生國論分裂，參議西鄕隆盛·板垣退助等連袂下野，與報界合力，督策政府，報紙乃呈畸形發達狀態，以致出現所謂「言論恐怖時代」。直到明治十四年政變之時，日本報紙除了「時事新報」一家以外，大都變為大小政黨的機關報，如「朝野新聞」·「自由新聞」·「立憲政黨新聞」等屬於自由黨系，郵便報知新聞」·「東京橫濱每日新聞」屬於改進黨系，「東京日日新聞」·「明洽日報」·「東洋新報」·「大東日報」屬於帝政黨系等，甚至後來各黨內部發生不同政見，各自發行「小新聞」為其喉舌，此種情形，後來在我國民初，也有同樣情形。然而也可看出日本初期報紙，巳經是在鬥爭的環境中成長的。日本憲法公布煎後，各報對於自己的責任毫不放鬆，不畏威屈，不為利誘，為人民作喉舌，向政府進諍言，而政府亦絕對尊重奧論界的地位。所以日本新聞事業日有發達，二十餘年之間，已可證明以下變個傾向，第一是為國為民主義與言論尊重主義，成為束京新聞界之傳統，每一張報紙都為其政治主張而奮鬥，雖然主張各不相同，然而無不以國民福利為第一義，因此深為政府及民間一致尊重；第二是非營利主義，不問為官辦民辦，都以辦報是為國家為人羣福利而努力，絕非為營利。（以下轉入第四版）</p>
<h3 id="c2">蒞滬視察民情畢汪主席昨日返京　並於行前發表重要談話 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>中央社滬訉汪主席二十六日蒞滬，二十九日旋駕首都，此行　為視察中日同盟條約及大東亞共同宣言後上海之民情，　為分別召見商統會各部門負資人，各大學校長，及金融實業敎育文化各界人士，聽取意見，垂詢現况。並就肅正思想，增加生產，保陣治安，促進統一，完遂戰爭各點，指示策進之方針。　為應中國靑少年團上海特別市團部，及中國靑年模範團第四聯隊之謂，訓示靑年對時局劃期進展應有之認識與努力。二十六七八各日，先後接見各界人士，除分別談話外，並舉行叙談，叙談時，並有陳院長公博，周部長佛海，棕部長思平，陳部長君恕，李部長聖五，林部長柏生，周委員化人，劉主任仰山，周秘書長隆庠，陳委員昌祖，李委貝浩駒等分別參加。</p>
<p>訓示靑年</p>
<p>昨（二十九日）上午十時蒞臨震旦大學訓話，除模範團各級隊長外，上大·交大。震旦·商學院·學醫院·聖約翰·二中·一師·二師·中法等大學及高級中學，及一區保甲靑年，海軍地區保甲靑年，均選派代表隊參加聆訓，統計一千五百餘人，是晨並由上海電台轉播，其他不及參加集中聆訓之靑少年及市民，亦均依時開機恭聽。（訓詞另餘）聆訓之長官，有陳中委，林部長柏生，陳部長君　，李部長聖五，周秘書長隆庠，陳委員昌祖，周委員化人，劉主任仰山，陳市長公博，暨市府秘書長，各局長處長等。領袖對全體剴切訓話，以靑年對中日同盟條約及大東亞宣言應有之認識為要旨，訓示靑年對目前時局劉期進展之光明方向應有之努力。語多勗勉，滔滔不絕，約歷一小時始畢·全體正襟危坐恭聆訓話，空氣莊嚴肅穆。全體聆訓後，莫不感奮異常，最後國民呼，末全體高呼領袖萬歲散會。</p>
<p>發表談話</p>
<p>本月三十日為中日盟約締結後之第1月，又為中日基本關係條約，及中日滿共同宣言三周年之期，汪主席適於此時親蒞上海，視察民情，並對靑年訓話，意義實至為重大。主席旋駕首都，特發表談話，茲恭錄於後：「上月三十日中日同盟條約簽字後，余曾發表文吿，對於由中日基本關係條約到中日同盟條約之經過，所有說明。並鄭重指示，　人今後應有之努力。昨日復曾對上海靑年演講，就於此點，再三致意。要之吾人對於劉時期的中日同盟條約，應該鼓起責任心，並增加負担力，以期其實施。中日同盟條約所規定的，是兩國互相尊重獨立自主，及　求共存共榮的最高原則，這正是束方道義精神的結晶品，與西方功利主義斤斤於計較利害，衡量權利義務的觀念不同。猶之一家之內，父子兄弟夫婦各盡其力，以謀家事之有條理，家業之興隆，以一國相親相愛之精神，各依本分做去，既不計較智識之優劣，亦不計較才力之長短，更無報酬可言。大東亞猶之家庭，中日兩國，同在此家處之內，同甘共苦，同生共死，乃是極天然而又極當然的事。惟相親然後能相信，亦惟相信然後能相親，道義精神，非空言，乃實行，必深味此意，身體而力行之，始能得中日同盟條約之眞諦也」「至於中日滿共同宣言，為中日滿三國敦睦邦交之基點，為東亞大陸建立軸心之礎石，亦為大東亞各國團結合作之張本。今則更進而有大東亞共同宣言之發表，兩奢精神意志，完全相同。而東亞各國相依相扶，共存共榮之基本原則，更見光明，共榮圈之範圍更為擴大。自茲以往，惟當一面根據中日滿共同宣言，一面本諸大東亞共同宜言，以求東亞軸心之强因，而謀大東亞戰爭之完遂，與大東亞共榮建設之實現。此又吾人今日對於中日滿共同宣言，及大東亞共同宣言之意義，所當深切認識身體而力行之者也。」</p>
<h3 id="c3">中日滿共同宣言　今三週年紀今　三國長官發表談話 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>褚外長</p>
<p>南京廿九日中央社電今（卅日）為中日滿發表共同宣言三還年紀念日，國府褚外長特發表談話如下：民國廿九年十一月卅日，中日滿三國發表共問宣言從此東亞柚心奠定基礎，大東亞共榮　之建設迅速展開。今日適逢共同宜言三屬年紀念之期。我人衷心感奮，實非言語所能形容於萬一。</p>
<p>東亞民族原為一個整體，而中日滿三國尤為東亞民族之中堅。東亞任何民族，均負有　東亞於繁榮昌盛之使命。中日滿三國尤須精誠團結，時刻匯勉努力，以求無負於此　大之使命。中日滿共同宣言中首稱，希望三國互相尊重其本然之特質，於束亞建設，以道義為基礎之新秩序之共同理想下，互為　　，緊密提携，俾形成東亞永久和平之軸心。並希望以此為核心，而　獻於世界全體之和平，此實為天經地義，歷萬代而不滅之原則。中日滿三國所應邁進之坦這，於此巳確切顯示。</p>
<p>東亞之復興　惟有待於東亞民族之緊密提携，勞力建設。同時對於英美之侵略，必須予以消減。　自數世紀以來，英美對於東亞恣意侵略，我束亞諸民族以往所以未克　密團結，力謀建設者，要乃英美挑撥離間，肆行侵略之所致。幸自大東亞戰爭發生之後，英美在東亞之侵略勢力，巳歸肅清，大東亞諸民族遂得於大束亞戰爭勝利之光榮中，向大東亞共榮　建設之大道邁進。</p>
<p>盟邦日本，對於束亞諸國家及諸民族，又復熱忱支援，我國自本年一月九日參戰之後，盟邦日本立即施行對華新政策，我國遂得收囘租界，撤廢冶外法權，完成多年宿望之獨立自主。近復締結中日同盟條約，蔚為中日外交史上最光榮之一頁。共他為緬甸及菲律賓，巳先後獨立，印度亦巳成立臨時政府。最迸中日滿泰非緬等六國，舉行大束亞會議於東京，發表大東亞宣言，對大東亞之建設，樹立歷史上得未曾有之宏謨，而為未來萬載之規範。</p>
<p>我人囘顧三年來大東亞光榮局勞之展開，實與中甘滿三國共同宣言有共密切不可分之關係。今後大東亞共榮　建股之完成，尙有待於東亞軸心之中日滿三國戰力同心，　發蹈勵，此為我人於今日紀念三國共同宣言深感慶幸之餘，所應愈益奮勉努力</p>
<p>谷大使</p>
<p>南京廿九日中央社社電日駐華谷大使，以三十日為中日滿三國發表共同宣言三週年紀念日，特於二十九日發表談話，其大意謂，中日滿三國共同宣言巳　三週年，其意義實極深長。蓋中日滿三國巳藉本宣言，　明互相尊重其主權及領土，並本平等互惠之精神，維持友好關係，同時中華民國並承認滿洲國，中滿關係於此確立。最迸因大東亞共同宣言之發表，建設大東亞共榮　之基礎，已完全確立。中日滿三國共同宣言，實為建設大東亞之一大基石，又中日兩國發表此宣言之同時所締結之中日基本條約，今因中甘盟約之締結而被取消。但本宣言依然有效。大東亞戰爭今益趨激烈，中日滿三國待此相倚相助，為貫澈此戰爭而努力，巳使世人對中日滿三國共同宣言之意義與使命，一新其認識</p>
<p>呂大使</p>
<p>南京廿九日中央社電中日滿自共同發表宣言以來，巳屆三年。滿洲國駐華大使呂榮　特發表感想大旨如下；</p>
<p>過去三年間，吾東亞雖遭逢震動天地之空煎變局，而始終持以堅强之態度，貫澈到底，實踐　人之共問理想，並收到偉大之成績。前此於東京宣布之大東亞宣言，洵足證明此共同理想之一大　進，因此中日滿三國共同宣言，乃使中滿兩國及大東亞諸民族，恢復其本然姿態，並進而為確立共榮圈最初之宣言，誠屬東亞外交史上具有劃時代的重要性之宣言也。</p>
<p>吾人於此時期，得歡迎意議深長之紀念日，不禁發生無限之感慨。方今東亞大局，由於日本陸海軍之忠勇奮戰，及雄　的政治力之推展，所有英美在東亞之侵略勢力，悉被肅淸，樹立必勝不敗之體勢。</p>
<h3 id="c4">林部長談話　紀念中日締約三週年 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>甫京二十九日中央社電本月三十日為中日同盟條約締結後之第一月，又為中日基本關係條約中H滿共同宜言三週年之期，宣傳部林部長特發表談話如次：</p>
<p>本月三十日為中日同盟條約締結後之第一月，又為中甘基本關係條約及中”滿共同宣言三周年之期。再過1星期，即將開始大東亞戰爭最光渾之第二年。中日同盟條約及大東亞共同宣言，不僅為中日關係，且為東亞歷史，及世界歷史劃時期之發展。主席在對上海各大學各高中靑年團訓話及談話中，巳　切訓示，吾人囘顧時局之進展，應知三年之前，苟無基本關係條約之訂立，則三年來中日兩方各自之努力與共同之協力，皆無從着手。無中日滿共同宜言，則東亞軸心之基礎無從樹立。無大東亞戰爭，則百年來侵略東亞之惡勢力，無從　淸，束亞解故，從而東亞各國獨立自主之機運，無從獲致。無同盟條約與共同宣言，則今後東亞各國互　互助，共存共榮之新時代，亦無從劃一界碑。</p>
<p>從觀大局，軍事上我方巳立於必勝不敗之基礎，姑不具論。即就政略上言之，英美蘇方面，無論其為三强會議，四强會　，不外　　共對於「再分割世界」上相互間之利害衝突。因經濟上之矛盾，發生政略上之紛歧，再影響及戰略上之失調。即令其所謂「均勢」政策，得到暫時的「平衡」，然侵略主義者，再分割世界之任何分　圖案，決非求自存，求共存之民族所能接受，尤非我東亞民族所能忍受之者。</p>
<p>自同盟條約及共同宣言發表以後，全國民衆對於國家及東亞前途之認識，固為之一新，然如何把握此時局之發展，策進將來，實有賴於舉國上下，尤共靑年民衆，毀力同心，共濟艱鉅。</p>
<p>主席昭吿吾人：「光明之方向巳山徬惶而到遠堅定，由糢糊而到淸楚。」今甘以前，在滿目瘡瘐之途程中，賴同志同胞以深切之反省。　起共深刻之責任心，用能扳荊新棘獲得進步。今日以後，在光明的前途愈益接迸之際，吾人尤當堅定促進和平統一，爭取決戰勝利之信念，以更深切之反省，負更重大之責任吾人不必間途租上之艱苦如何。唯當間吾人之努力如何，努力所得到之進步如何。能努力必能有進步！有進步當更努力，過去如此，今後尤　如此。主席詩句有云：「山川重秀非無策，共　丹心不使灰，」題我靑年我同胞深長思之也。</p>

<p>十月三十日所簽訂的中甘同盟條約，十一月六日所發衷的大東亞宣言，無疑的是一件劃等期的事實，如今將這　義，說明如下：</p>
<p>各位都是靑年，大　靑年心中、對於國家社會的現狀、都是不滿的尤其在此存亡危急的時代，靑年的心境，較不滿二字，更不知超過看千倍。</p>
<p>不滿心境分析</p>
<p>如今先將這些不　的心境，加以分析、先把因為自己的生活壓迫而對國家社會不滿的心事除去，那麽賸下的，只是純粹　於國家社會現狀的不滿了。這種分析是重要的，前者實有私心，後奢則純出於公</p>
<p>再將對於國家社會現狀的不滿，加以分析，先把　　的心事除去，那麼賸下的只是純粹由於憂心與愛念而發生的不滿了。這種分析，更是重要的，鄙薄是根本看自己國家社會不起，至於因憂之深愛之切，而太息痛恨自已的國家社會不如人、這正是對於國家社會之忠誠。</p>
<p>靑年心中有一種對於自己國家社會的不滿，這不滿是由於公與忠誠而起，那麼這種不滿，毋當說是國家社會所需要．因為不滿足，故求進步，求進步，故肯努力，如果認定了一個光明方向而過往煎進，則必能接近於光明，不滿的心理。艇而為求進步的心理。　然成功未知何時，但進步即是成功的過程，固然在此過程中，有許多障碍，許多曲折，但方向不誤，即這種過程，每個靑年都能忍受困難，克服困難，而進步不巳．以底於成功。</p>
<p>由此說來，靑年所需要的，是一個光明的方向，有了一個光明的方向，則靑年的心力，有了用慮，由不滿而努力，由進步而成功。</p>
<p>剛纔所說劃時期的意義，在那裏呢？數十年來，所調光明的方向，由彷徨而到達了堅定，由糢糊而到達了淸楚</p>
<p>我為甚麼說這話呢？</p>
<p>民元前後方向</p>
<p>民元以前．靑年所認定的方面，是民族全義，那時候，一般靑年，既痛心於國際形勢的險惡，瓜分共管，迫於眉睫，又痛心於前浩政府的腐敗，由於這種的不滿，便不期而然的，把心力集緊在民族主義方面，雖然當時也　入些民權民生的成分，但是稀薄得很，遠不及民族主義的濃厚。當時的民族主義，其主要目的，對內想做到國內民族，一律平等，對外想做到中國民族獨立自主．辛亥之役。國內民族，在政治上地位平等，已經做到，而對外則重重障礙，未能達到目的，直到如今，反省起來，當時的民族主義，實在忽咯了一個電要因素，民族主義，應該以大亞洲主義為核心，中國自己想得到獨立自主，同時亞洲有詳多民族，也想到獨立自主，以大亞洲主義，互相團結，共同協力，力量方纔弘厚，方總能將壓制剝奪亞洲諸民族使不能得到獨立自主的共同敵人英美帝國、王義者打倒。無如當時忽略了這一點，和亞洲其他民族，沒有團結，甚至於互相磨擦，互相衝突，如此，不但力量分散，甚至於為英美帝國主義者所利用，挑撥離間，使之走向互相殘殺的這途，於是獨立自主之目的，愈離愈遠，論到這種責住，無論中國是獨　，是分擔，都不能不承認。</p>
<p>國際共產主義</p>
<p>以上是民元前後的事實，至於民十前後，却又換了一番局面了。一般青年，見民族主義不能達到目的，認為這個方向，是不對的，於是發生了另外尋找方向的企圖，於是國際主義及共產主義，代之而起。兩種主義，過然不同，却有其相同的一點，便是反對民族主義，國際主義，以為民族主義太狹隘了，應該着眼於全世界全人類，共產主義以為民族主義是不必要的，應談着眼於階級。這兩種主義，風行的結果，民族主義，幾為之窒息，國際主義者，有一大毒，他口口說世界，似平比亞洲主義大，比一國的民族主義更大，其實他忘記了這世界是誰的，自從上次　戰結束以來，世界覇權，操諸英美之手，除了蘇聯埋頭於試騐共產主義，日本埋頭於準備，暫時緘默之外，世界上祗有兩種動態，其一是；追隨英美之後，略分　餘，如法國等是，其二是：淪於次殖民地的地位，不能自拔，世界大部分未能得到獨立自主的國家與失了自由的民族皆是。試問在這樣局面之下，所謂世界，從何說起，國際主義者忽略了這一點，共結果遂成為大亞洲主義及民族主義的離散者，同時成為英美帝國主義的擁議者。至於共產主義者的大毒，在只認階級，不認國家民族，自民十四五年以來，國民黨與共產黨的爭特，就在這一點，國民黨對於經濟現狀，認為現在產業並未發達，階級對立，並不題著，全國資富，雖參差不齊，在國際上比較起來，都可謂之小　，遭可以發達國家資本施行計劃經濟來解決的，不必講階級鬥爭，共產黨不然，硬將這參差不齊的小貧，分成無數階級，挑撥一階級，對於其他階級，從事鬥爭，其結果，造成空煎的民族間自相殘殺，不但國家的　華，民族的元氣，為之摧毀，而在階級觀念之下．民族主義，大亞洲主義，也為之拋棄無餘了。最可慨的，毛澤東煎年在重慶沉說，中國社會是橄欖核形，兩頭小，中間大，所謂兩頭小，是上沒有大資產階級，下沒有無產　級，所謂中間大，是中小產業的人最多，中國今日為生存而奮鬥，應當國結這些中小產業者云云，這正所謂既有今日′何必當初，早知如此，何苦造成空煎的民族問自相殘殺，把國家斷送到選地步呢？</p>
<p>鄙薄國家民族</p>
<p>國際主義者與共產主義者，還有一相同之點，便是鄙薄自己的國家民族，國際主義者，羨慕英美的繁業，拿中國來比較，覺得事事都不如人，於是對自巳國家民族。起了鄙薄，連自巳的祖宗，也說是「罪華深重禍延後裔，」這樣一來，所有愛國心，優剷除凈盡了，民族主義，便無所附　了，可是自巳國家民族可以鄙薄，自巳個人却要高自位置的，於是不知不　走向個人主義方面去，既然一切事物，都是英美的好，自然自巳個人一切享受，都是英美的好，所以上海租界內，洋房多，起居　食考　，至於公共事業，國防事端，則無人顧問，反之　在日本的都市，所見的人民，所住依然是矮矮的木　，所食依然淡薄的　物，而公共事業，尤其是國防事業，却極度的發達，這便是一個極朋著的例。共產主義者的行逕，雖與國際主義者相反，但因為有了鄙薄自己國家民族長的觀念，覺得自巳國家民族樣樣都要不得，絕不有所留戀，絕不有所愛惜，所以一意破壞，以盡為度，總而言之，國際全義共產主義得勢，則民族主義倒　，民族主義的核心大亞洲主義也　無從提起。因為中國不如英美，整個亞洲也不如英美。</p>
<p>中國在鄙薄之列，亞洲也在鄙薄之列，這是自然的結論，陳獨秀與胡適之討論整個國放我：「這是想從糞堆中找香水」，不錯，胡適之以能從　堆中我得一點香水自誇，陳獨秀以為香水何必從糞堆中找，兩個人議論不同，而將中國文化看成業堆的立脚點，則實乎不同，既然自己國家民族和糞堆一磁那還愛他做什麽？（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c25">評言　棉花之增加生產 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>在棉花統制委員會成立之前一日，我們曾論產業經濟政策，認為如何使食　增產？如何使棉　增產？藉使戰時人民的衣食都不至於發生問題，實為今日最迫切最重要，最値得研究討論以至於付諸實施的問題，翌日（十一月二十七日）棉統會成立大會中，盟邦日本田尻公使致詞，亦言「在華中物資方面，當以棉花與食米為重要…本人希望棉統會此後應注憲如何增加生產。」</p>
<p>棉花之增加生產正如那天蘇實業部長代表行政院汪院長所說的，一則可以協力大東亞戰事，一則可以谿國利民。因為棉花一項，是中國主要農產品之一，又為工業原料上重要物資之一，其關係民生之重大，自不待言：即令政府所收買之棉紗布實行配給了，假若不能繼績努力於棉紗布之製造，那末，紗布配給的前途經是渺茫的。因此、棉花之增加生產·乃為貫澈紗布配給方案的基本問題。</p>
<p>欲求棉花之增加生產，其最先決的問題即為獎勵其生產與再生產，而最有效的方法就是：　提高收買棉花的價格，使農民今後樂於從事棉花之生產，　係證收買資金之眞正入於棉花生產的農民手中，使其再生產之資本無處缺乏。　儘量以都市中之棉花製成品低價普遍配給於農民，使其直接瞭解棉花增產之意義，以及棉花對於農民的切　關係。基於以上三個方法，—都是並行不背的—棉花之增產希望，殆無問題。深知棉統會的力量，絕非棉薄，當可本此方針，達成增產目的。</p>

<h3 id="c35">代論（自第版轉來） <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>第三，後來不偏不黨的傾向，遂漸在黨派主義傳統中出現了，並且獲得民間一致的擁護與愛好，這是明治二十三年第一次議曾以後的事，隨着民主憲政運動的高潮，過去所謂「大新聞」的政黨機關報聲價大跌，時事·朝日·日本·國民等不偏不黨的報紙取得全國的信任，漸成以後日本報紙一種新趨勢。第四是國粹主義即反歐化主義的傾向，以上述一日本」及「國民」二報開始造成二大新興勢力，主張對內保存傳統的優點，創造日本獨得的文化，對外伸張國權，使全亞洲從白人支配下獲得獨立。可說是大東亞戰爭的思想上的淵源。</p>
<p>日俄戰爭使日本報紙有了更進一步的發展，正如這次戰爭之使日本奠定世界第一等强國的地位一樣。而這一時代，日本新聞界最値得注目的傾向是對於經營與技術上的改善。由於戰爭的發展，開始有戰地記者的派遣和戰事新聞的報道，以應全國人民的要求，更由於戰時軍事秘密及通信困難，展開了技術與經營競爭。自日俄戰爭以後，日本新聞事業乃開始成為資本主義的企業，開始內部企業性的組識，開始注意廣吿與發行，開始注力於設備及編輯技能之改善，同時，夕刋（晚報）及地方版也開始普遍發展：而更可注意的是通　事業之發達。日本新聞事業從此奠定其在世界新聞事業上的重要地位。</p>
<p>然而　日本報紙更進一步而擔負起民族的歷史的使命？，無疑的還是從第一次世界大戰至第二次世界大戰的時代，第一次歐洲大戰爆發後，日本報道機關即隨戰爭而躍進，日本新聞事業亦隨經濟界的景氣而發達，當時　　新聞乃成為報界競爭的中心，全國各界英不密切關件着，因為歐戰的動靜，與日本經濟乃至國力的發展，有着最密切的關係。第一次歐洲大戰以後，日本　論機關更與公開外交同時躍進，即以巴黎和會而論，當時日本主席全權代表為元老西園寺公望，及駐英法意諸國大使，　主要報社派出的特派員及地方報的囑託特派員竟有五十名之多！連絡會議代表　國內與論，為國家支持外交！其後如第一次國際勞工會議，如華府會議，如軍縮會議，都曾協力外交，表現日本與論的力量，而且和英美各國新聞業者展開熱烈的競爭。一九二七年八月，國際聯盟召開「國際新聞專家會議」，日本代表尤為活躍，力謀通過其提案，鞏固日本新聞事業在全世界的地位。</p>
<p>最近十年間日本新聞事業又踏進一新時期，大體上可說是統制時代的初期。其間主要的是「新聞聯合社」之誕生。自從日本新聞業奠定了國際的地位之後，即進而展開國際的活動。日本的國際新聞，一向受路透社的支配，至此乃力謀擺脫，第一步於一允二西年與路透社立約，保持日本國際新聞的自主權，其後國際通信社更為强化自主權而由該社社長岩永斤親赴莫斯科，與蘇聯國營的洛斯泰通信社（即今日之塔斯通信社）交涉，順利成立對等通信契約。更經倫敦到紐約，與合衆社創立者曼兩維爾·史托恩氏會見，探悉其歷史，組織及運營大要以為本國取法。歸國後即與「朝日」，「每日」，「中外」，「報知一，「國民」，「時事」等各大報的幹部協商，消弭無謂的競爭，結成有力的新聞陣綫，經過不斷的努力，終於一九二六年一月，由國際通信社與報知，東日，東朝，中外，國民，時事，大朝，大每八大報，倣效美國合衆社的組織機構，成立「日小新聞聯合社」。迨一九三一年十月，合併「聯合」及「電通」兩社，成立日本最初之國家的代表通信社「社團法人同盟通信社」。</p>
<p>我們檢討日本五十年來新聞的發展史，至少可以認識如下幾點，即第一，日本新聞事業是與國家之强盛發展有密切關聯的，作為國家與人民的事業而經營，以國家社會為前提的。第二，日本新聞界在經營組織，備，技術及人才之吸收方而是互相競爭的，然而對於國家民族及社會事業的貢獻，是一致的·第三，日本新聞事業經營者及從業員，不得兼任政府官吏及經營新聞以外其他事業，同時政府官吏及新聞以外各界人員，亦不得經營報紙及其他新聞有關事業，因此，日本新聞事業得有健全的發展，而發揮其與論的力量。第四，日本的新聞事業雖然作為資本主義企業　經營的，其間也曾有營利主義的成分，然而在國策之下，特別是在戰時，絕對在「國家至上」「公益優先」的目標之下，犧牲奮鬥，對一切有害於國家及公益者斷然拒絕，反之，對一切有利於國家及公益者，則雖使報社經濟上受些損失亦必為之。第五，我們必須特別指出日本當局對於「言論的尊重」，和「新聞扶導政策」，消極方面只要無不利於國家與公益，決無濫行禁制及輕易妨碍新聞事業的言行，積極方面更盡力扶助及指導，使新聞事業有健全與正當的發展，無論在人力技術以及材料（如紙張）配給方面，都很合理而普遍，因為只有為國家的報紙，只有為人民的報紙，沒有政府某派系或某個人的報紙，所以，雖在戰時，而日本新聞事業，依然呈現進步狀態，得以負起歷史的使命！</p>
<p>「公理之筆，與正義之劍，共同為祖國與東亞而戰鬥！」我們對日木新聞界先進之犧牲奮鬥表示無限的敬愛，我們更不能不對本國新聞界發生熱烈的期待。</p>

<h3 id="e1">On the Development of the Japanese Newspaper Industry <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>"The pen of justice and the sword of righteousness fight together for the motherland and East Asia!" This is the fundamental stance of the Japanese newspaper industry today.</p>
<p>Japanese journalists have been sacrificing and striving tirelessly for years, and they have been doing so in unified solidarity. For the sake of the progress of the newspaper industry, it is necessary for us to study Japan and learn from the Japanese newspaper industry.</p>
<p>The history of the Japanese newspaper industry is a mirror reflecting Japan's transition from the Meiji Restoration to its era of strength, and this mirror is forever inseparable from Japan's Restoration and its path to strength.</p>
<p>Japan's modern newspapers emerged as early as the second year of Bunkyu (1862), before the Meiji era. The first was the "Batavia Shimbun," a translation of Dutch newspapers from Java, published by the Western bookseller Binya Heishiro. As for original Japanese newspapers, the earliest included the "Daijokan Nisshi" (Kyoto), the initial official gazette of the Meiji government in February of the first year of Meiji (1868), and the "Chugai Shimbun" (Edo), sponsored by Bakufu retainer Yanagawa Shunsan and others. Consulting Japanese history from that time, it can be seen that Japanese newspapers were born when domestic unrest reached its peak and the Restoration movement was launched nationwide. From then on, the Japanese newspaper industry gradually struggled for Restoration and civilization under the common demand of the nation and its people. Among the most famous early newspapers were the "Yokohama Mainichi Shimbun," Japan's first daily newspaper, born in Yokohama in December of the third year of Meiji (the predecessor of the "Tokyo Mainichi"), the "Shimbun Zasshi," which emerged in May of the fifth year of Meiji, and the "Tokyo Nichinichi," "Nisshin Shinji-shi," and "Yubin Hochi" which also emerged in the fifth year of Meiji. These five newspapers were known as the five major newspapers of early Japan. Initially, they all had the character of newspapers serving the government, until later, due to the debate over the invasion of Korea, national opinion split, and Councillors Saigo Takamori, Itagaki Taisuke, and others jointly resigned, joining forces with the press to urge the government. The newspapers then developed abnormally, leading to the so-called "era of speech terror." By the time of the political upheaval in the fourteenth year of Meiji, except for the "Jiji Shinpo," most Japanese newspapers had become organs of various large and small political parties. For example, the "Choya Shimbun," "Jiyu Shimbun," and "Rikken Seito Shimbun" belonged to the Liberal Party faction, the "Yubin Hochi Shimbun" and "Tokyo Yokohama Mainichi Shimbun" belonged to the Progressive Party faction, and the "Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun," "Meiji Nippo," "Toyo Shinpo," and "Daito Nippo" belonged to the Imperial Party faction. Later, when internal disagreements arose within each party, they even issued their own "small newspapers" as their mouthpieces, a situation that also occurred in our country in the early years of the Republic of China. However, it can also be seen that Japanese newspapers in their early stages grew up in an environment of struggle. After the promulgation of the Japanese Constitution, each newspaper did not relax its responsibility in the slightest, not fearing power, not being tempted by profit, acting as a mouthpiece for the people, offering advice to the government, and the government absolutely respected the position of public opinion. Therefore, the Japanese newspaper industry developed rapidly. In the past twenty years or so, the following trends have been proven: first, nationalism and democracy, and the respect for freedom of speech, have become the traditions of the Tokyo press. Every newspaper fights for its political views, although the views may differ, they all consider the welfare of the people as the top priority, and are therefore deeply respected by the government and the public; second, the spirit of non-profit, whether government-run or privately-run, they all strive to run newspapers for the benefit of the country and the people, and not for profit.

In addition to the leaders of all levels of the Model Corps, representatives from Shanghai University, Jiaotong University, Aurora University, Business School, Medical School, St. John's University, No. 2 Middle School, No. 1 Normal School, No. 2 Normal School, Sino-French University and other universities and senior high schools, as well as youths from the Baojia system in the First District and the Baojia system in the naval district, were selected to participate in the listening session, totaling more than 1,500 people. That morning, it was also broadcast by Shanghai Radio. Other youths and citizens who could not participate in the centralized listening session also turned on their radios on time to listen respectfully. (The full text of the instructions is printed separately.)

Everyone sat upright and listened respectfully to the instructions in a solemn and respectful atmosphere. After listening to the instructions, everyone was deeply moved. Finally, they shouted "Long live the nation!" and the entire group shouted "Long live the leader!" before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Statement Released</p>
<p>This month, the 30th, marks the first month after the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, and also the third anniversary of the Basic Treaty of Sino-Japanese Relations and the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration. It is extremely significant that Chairman Wang personally came to Shanghai at this time to inspect public sentiment and give instructions to the youth. Before returning to the capital, the Chairman released a statement, which is respectfully recorded below: "After the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty on the 30th of last month, I issued a document explaining the process from the Basic Treaty of Sino-Japanese Relations to the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty. I also solemnly instructed everyone on the efforts that should be made in the future. Yesterday, I gave a speech to the Shanghai youth, reiterating this point. In short, we should be responsible for the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty in the current era, and increase our ability to bear the burdens so as to achieve its implementation. The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty stipulates the highest principles of mutual respect for independence and autonomy between the two countries, and the pursuit of coexistence and co-prosperity, which is a crystallization of the spirit of Eastern morality, and differs from the Western utilitarian concept of calculating gains and losses and weighing rights and obligations. Just as within a family, fathers, sons, brothers, and husbands each do their best to manage the family affairs in an orderly manner and to prosper the family business, with a spirit of love and affection between countries, each does what is proper, without regard to the superiority or inferiority of knowledge, or the length or shortness of talent and strength, and there is no reward to speak of. Greater East Asia is like a family, and China and Japan are both in this family, sharing weal and woe, and living and dying together, which is extremely natural and extremely proper. Only by being close to each other can we believe in each other, and only by believing in each other can we be close to each other. The spirit of morality is not empty talk, but practice. We must deeply understand this meaning, practice it with our bodies, and then we can understand the true meaning of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty." "As for the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration, it is the basis for harmonious relations between China, Japan, and Manchukuo, the cornerstone for establishing an axis on the East Asian continent, and the basis for the unity and cooperation of various countries in Greater East Asia. Now, we have further advanced with the issuance of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, and our spiritual will is completely the same. The basic principles of mutual dependence, mutual assistance, coexistence, and co-prosperity among the countries of East Asia have become even clearer, and the scope of the co-prosperity sphere has been further expanded. From now on, we should, on the one hand, base ourselves on the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration, and on the other hand, adhere to the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, to seek the strengthening of the East Asian axis, to plan for the completion of the Greater East Asia War, and the realization of the construction of Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This is also what we should deeply understand, embody, and strive to practice today regarding the meaning of the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration."</p>
<h3 id="e3">Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration Commemorates its Third Anniversary Today – Officials from the Three Countries Issue Statements <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Minister Chu</p>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) – Today (the 30th) is the third anniversary of the issuance of the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration. Foreign Minister Chu of the National Government has issued the following statement: On November 30th, the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration was issued, and from then on, the axis of East Asia was established, and the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere rapidly unfolded. Today, as we commemorate the third anniversary of the Joint Declaration, our sincere excitement cannot be fully expressed in words.</p>
<p>The East Asian nations were originally a single entity, and China, Japan, and Manchukuo are the backbone of the East Asian nations. Every East Asian nation bears the mission of leading East Asia to prosperity. China, Japan, and Manchukuo must be sincerely united, constantly encourage each other, and strive to be worthy of this great mission. The Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration states that the three countries hope to respect each other's inherent characteristics, to cooperate closely under the common ideal of building a new order in East Asia based on morality, and to form an axis of permanent peace in East Asia. It also hopes to use this as a core to contribute to the peace of the entire world. This is a principle that is as natural and righteous as the laws of heaven and earth, and will not perish for ten thousand generations. The path that China, Japan, and Manchukuo should take has been clearly shown here.</p>
<p>The revival of East Asia can only be achieved through the close cooperation and industrious construction of the East Asian nations. At the same time, the aggression of Britain and the United States must be eliminated. For centuries, Britain and the United States have wantonly invaded East Asia. The reason why our East Asian nations have not been able to unite closely in the past to strive for construction is due to the instigation and aggression of Britain and the United States. Fortunately, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia have been eliminated, and the nations of Greater East Asia have been able to advance towards the path of building a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in the glory of victory in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Our ally Japan has been enthusiastically supporting the countries and nations of East Asia. After our country joined the war on January 9th of this year, our ally Japan immediately implemented a new policy towards China, and our country was able to recover the concessions, abolish extraterritorial rights, and achieve the independence and autonomy that it had long desired. Recently, the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was concluded, becoming one of the most glorious pages in the history of Sino-Japanese diplomacy. Furthermore, Burma and the Philippines have already become independent, and India has also established a provisional government. Most recently, China, Japan, Manchukuo, Thailand, the Philippines, and Burma held the Greater East Asia Conference in Tokyo, and issued the Greater East Asia Declaration, establishing a grand plan for the construction of Greater East Asia that has never been seen in history, and setting a standard for the future for ten thousand years.</p>
<p>When we look back at the glorious development of Greater East Asia over the past three years, it is closely and inextricably linked to the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration. In the future, the completion of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere still depends on the joint efforts of the war capabilities of China, Japan, and Manchukuo, the axis of East Asia. This is what we should strive to do all the more, in addition to being deeply gratified by commemorating the three-nation Joint Declaration today.</p>
<p>Ambassador Tani</p>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) – Ambassador Tani of Japan to China, on the occasion of the third anniversary of the issuance of the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration on the 30th, issued a statement on the 29th, saying that the significance of the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration is extremely profound. China, Japan, and Manchukuo have, by means of this declaration, made it clear that they respect each other's sovereignty and territory, and maintain friendly relations based on the spirit of equality and mutual benefit. At the same time, the Republic of China recognizes Manchukuo, and the relations between China and Manchukuo are thus established. Most recently, with the issuance of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, the foundation for building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has been completely established. The Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration is a major cornerstone for the construction of Greater East Asia. In addition, the Basic Treaty of Sino-Japanese Relations, which was concluded at the same time as the issuance of this declaration by China and Japan, has now been cancelled due to the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty. However, this declaration remains valid. The Greater East Asia War is now becoming more and more intense, and China, Japan, and Manchukuo are relying on each other and helping each other in order to strive for the completion of this war, which has given the world a new understanding of the meaning and mission of the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration.</p>
<p>Ambassador Lu</p>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) – Three years have passed since China, Japan, and Manchukuo jointly issued a declaration. Ambassador Lu Ronghuan of Manchukuo to China has issued the following statement of feelings:</p>
<p>Over the past three years, although our East Asia has encountered earth-shattering changes, we have always maintained a strong attitude, carried through to the end, put into practice our common ideals, and achieved great results. The Greater East Asia Declaration, which was announced previously in Tokyo, is sufficient to prove a major advancement of this common ideal. Therefore, the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration has enabled China, Manchukuo, and the nations of Greater East Asia to restore their original posture, and has also become the first declaration to establish the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and is truly a declaration of epoch-making importance in the diplomatic history of East Asia.</p>
<p>At this time, we welcome this commemorative day with profound significance, and cannot help but feel boundless emotion. At present, the situation in East Asia is such that, due to the loyal and courageous fighting of the Japanese army and navy, and the promotion of majestic political power, all the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia have been eliminated, and a system of certain victory and invincibility has been established.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Minister Lin's Speech Commemorates the Third Anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Treaty <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) – This month, the 30th, marks the first month after the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, and also the third anniversary of the Basic Treaty of Sino-Japanese Relations and the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration. Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department has issued the following statement:</p>
<p>This month, the 30th, marks the first month after the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, and also the third anniversary of the Basic Treaty of Sino-Japanese Relations and the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration. In another week, the most glorious second year of the Greater East Asia War will begin. The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration are not only developments that mark an era in Sino-Japanese relations, but also in the history of East Asia and the history of the world. In his instructions and speech to the youth groups of various universities and high schools in Shanghai, the Chairman has given clear instructions. When we look back at the progress of the current situation, we should know that without the establishment of the Basic Treaty of Relations three years ago, the efforts of both China and Japan over the past three years, and their joint cooperation, could not have been started. Without the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration, the foundation of the East Asian axis could not have been established. Without the Greater East Asia War, the evil forces that have been invading East Asia for a century could not have been eliminated, and the opportunity for East Asian nations to achieve independence and autonomy could not have been obtained. Without the Alliance Treaty and the Joint Declaration, the new era in which East Asian countries support each other, help each other, coexist, and co-prosper could not have been marked with a milestone.</p>
<p>Looking at the overall situation, militarily, our side has already established a foundation of certain victory and invincibility, which need not be discussed in detail. Even in terms of political strategy, the three-power conference or four-power conference of the British, American, and Soviet sides is nothing more than competing for their conflicting interests in the "re-division of the world." Due to economic contradictions, political disagreements arise, which then affect strategic imbalances. Even if their so-called "balance of power" policy achieves temporary "equilibrium," any division plan of the re-division of the world by the aggressors will never be accepted by nations seeking self-preservation and coexistence, and especially not by our East Asian nations.</p>
<p>Since the issuance of the Alliance Treaty and the Joint Declaration, the national public's understanding of the future of the country and East Asia has certainly been renewed, but how to grasp the development of this current situation and promote the future depends on the people of the whole country, especially the youth public, working together with all their might to overcome difficulties together.</p>
<p>The Chairman has announced to us: "The direction of light has gone from hesitant and distant to firm, from vague to clear." Before today, in the process of full of wounds, we relied on comrades and compatriots to deeply reflect and raise a deep sense of responsibility in order to overcome difficulties and make progress. After today, as the bright future approaches, we should firmly believe in promoting peace and unity, and strive for a decisive victory, with deeper reflection and greater responsibility. We do not need to ask how difficult the path is. We only need to ask how hard we have worked, and how much progress we have made through our efforts. If we work hard, we will definitely make progress! If we make progress, we should work even harder. This was the case in the past, and it should be even more so in the future. The Chairman's poem says: "Mountains and rivers are beautiful again, not without a plan, and a common loyalty will not let the heart be disheartened." Let my young people and my compatriots think deeply about this.</p>

<h3 id="e5">Japanese General Headquarters Announced Yesterday the War Results on the Gilbert Islands – A Total of Eight Enemy Ships Were Sunk and Destroyed <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 29th the war situation in the Gilbert Islands as follows: On the morning of the 25th, an Imperial submarine attacked an enemy aircraft carrier in the waters west of Makin Island, inflicting heavy damage (or it may have sunk). On the evening of the 26th, units of the Imperial Navy Air Force attacked an enemy mobile force in the waters west of the Gilbert Islands, sinking two enemy aircraft carriers. One of our aircraft did not return to base. (Note) This air battle is called the Second Air Battle of the Gilbert Islands. On the evening of the 27th, units of the Imperial Navy Air Force attacked an attacking enemy mobile force in the waters west of the Gilbert Islands, sinking two enemy aircraft carriers, including one large aircraft carrier, sinking two cruisers, and destroying an enemy cruiser (or battleship) (heavily damaged and on fire). Five of our aircraft did not return to base. (Note) This air battle is called the Third Air Battle of the Gilbert Islands. Regarding the war situation on Tarawa and Makin Islands, because contact with the garrison on the island has been lost, there is no detailed report. However, fierce fighting seems to be continuing on Tarawa. Our naval air force is continuously bombing the enemy's positions on the island. (Appendix) The air battle on the 22nd in the waters west of the Gilbert Islands, which was announced earlier, is called the First Air Battle of the Gilbert Islands.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) – According to front-line news, Major General Smith, commander of the US Second Marine Division, recently discussed the valiant fighting of the Japanese army in the Gilbert Islands, saying that the Japanese army's heroic resistance in the Gilbert Islands, was unprecedented, was truly rare. The number of American deaths was enormous, and we were only able to secure a bridgehead. Such a battle is truly something that I have never seen in my life. The major general has participated in jungle warfare in the Pacific before, and his words are sincere.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Brave and Valiant American Officers Amazed</p>
<p>Argentine Journalist</p>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) – In order to cover up its repeated defeats on Bougainville Island, the US military has launched an amphibious operation from the Gilbert Islands, using all its naval and air power. However, the Japanese garrison is brave and skilled in combat, which makes the American people feel the difficulty of fighting against Japan. Lieutenant Colonel James Roosevelt, son of President Roosevelt, recently returned to Hawaii from the Makin front. On the 27th, he met with a group of reporters and spoke of the Japanese soldiers' fighting spirit, saying that when the Japanese soldiers on Makin Island saw that they were outnumbered, four officers, dressed in formal military uniforms and wearing medals, led hundreds of soldiers to attack the American positions, fighting to the last man. Their spirit is truly admirable. Lieutenant Colonel Carlson, who also participated in the Guadalcanal campaign, also praised the Japanese soldiers' courage on the 27th, saying: I participated in the Guadalcanal campaign, and was shocked by the fierce fighting, but compared to the landing operation on Tarawa Island, it pales in comparison. The Japanese Marine Corps held Tarawa Island, which is only two and a half miles long and eight hundred yards wide, and resisted heroically to the end. Although they were outnumbered, the seriously wounded soldiers all died heroically, and the remaining soldiers still held their ground. When the American Navy landed one battalion on the north side of the main island of the Tarawa Island atoll, the Japanese army was not alarmed, but calmly responded to the battle, without any sign of surrender or retreat.</p>

<p>Argentine Journalist</p>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) – The US military suffered heavy casualties when it launched a landing operation on Betio Island (the main island surrounding Tarawa Island). Major General Smith, commander of the US Second Marine Division, called this battle an unprecedented fierce battle. According to news from the front lines from American special correspondents: Mines were laid all over Betio Island, and barbed wire crisscrossed everywhere. Machine guns were densely lined up on the coast like serrated teeth. When the navy approached the coast, bullets rained down. In addition, the Japanese army hid in boats parked in the lagoon and fired from behind. It was difficult for the US fleet to concentrate artillery fire from the sea to launch a fierce attack, but the Japanese army held its ground, using machine guns and mortars to counterattack, causing heavy casualties to the American troops who gradually landed after crossing the lagoon. Furthermore, according to a report on the 29th by Mr. Johnstone, who represented various American newspapers and news agencies to participate in this American landing operation: It was truly an unusual miracle that the US military was able to land on Tarawa Island. Although the exact figures of the US military's losses have not yet been determined, this battle was truly an unprecedented bloody tragedy in American military history. The number of deaths is generally considered to be very large. Japanese machine gun nests are scattered all over the coast, one every five feet. In addition, large cannons are placed every twenty-five yards at locations five fortifications behind. Barbed wire surrounds the coast a few feet away. Up to now, bodies are still lying all over the place at the landing point of the US military, making passage extremely difficult. The Japanese army also fired fiercely with cannons with a caliber of seventy-seven millimeters, causing all the landing boats to be destroyed. The naval units then rushed towards the coast through the water, but were swept by Japanese machine guns. At this point, they had to crawl around the barbed wire while attacking. More than one hundred American naval soldiers died while cutting a section of barbed wire.</p>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced that the Japanese Navy had achieved great results in the Gilbert Islands. When the news came, the German people expressed their deep welcome. In addition to publishing the war results with large headlines, various evening newspapers praised the Japanese Navy's bravery.</p>

<h3 id="e8">Instructions from Minister Aoki <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing, 29th: Vice Minister Yamamoto of the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry read out Minister Aoki's instructions at the Japanese diplomatic and consular conference in China, which opened on the 29th. The main points are as follows: The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration and the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty have already been concluded and announced by the relevant countries of Greater East Asia and by China and Japan. There is no need to elaborate on the content of these declarations and treaties. In order to realize these two major missions, it is not enough to simply announce the declarations and treaties. These two major missions can only be given their true value after concrete efforts are made to implement them. You are all the backbone of promoting national policy, and you should abandon petty personal interests, make concerted efforts from a broad perspective, and complete our mission. The current situation is entering a decisive phase, and our country is proceeding with our courageous and noble ideals in both political and military aspects, as well as in national policy. Most importantly, all working comrades should promote and encourage a sense of responsibility and make even greater efforts. In addition to working hard to implement concrete policies towards China, adjust established facts, abolish extraterritorial rights, and fulfill the established policies of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, working comrades should also cooperate with the National Government to strengthen its political power, or fully cooperate with China in various aspects such as production of food and commodity prices. At the same time, in order to expand the results of new policies towards China, the fundamental spirit of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration and the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty should be given top priority. Without distinguishing between public and private matters, this spirit should be infused into the lives of overseas Chinese in China, so that Sino-Japanese cooperation can be steadily realized. In particular, the production increase movement to promote combat power through Sino-Japanese cooperation is most important, and I deeply hope that everyone will provide more cooperation to ensure thorough success.</p>

<p>A Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing, 29th: Japanese Ambassador to China Tani gave instructions at the diplomatic and consular conference on the morning of the 29th. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Two years have passed since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The war is becoming more and more intense, and our gains are also increasing. Therefore, it is necessary to unite the total national strength to meet the needs. Therefore, we must first reform the embassy structure to simplify affairs. This is the direction of gradual improvement in the future. The concept of total national strength arising from the center of humanity is most important. In order to win the war, everyone should understand the meaning of the Greater East Asia War, rise up with a sense of mission and patriotic enthusiasm, and engage in [unclear].</p>
<p>Recalling the past war, our country's soldiers fought bravely and have gradually achieved their goals. At the same time, after the implementation of the new policies towards China, Sino-Japanese relations have made new leaps forward. With the conclusion of this alliance treaty between China and Japan, and then with the expression of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, the meaning and mission of the Greater East Asia War are gradually being implemented. Regarding the issue of China's construction, the Japanese side should provide full cooperation, and I hope that everyone will work hard on this.</p>
<p>At the same time, because the actions of the residents are the actions of the Japanese nation, in view of the meaning and mission of the Greater East Asia War, the residents should not neglect their self-awareness. I hope that the residents will pay attention to self-love in the stage of implementing Japanese policy.</p>

<p>The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty signed on October 30th and the Greater East Asia Declaration expressed on November 6th are undoubtedly epoch-making facts. Now, I will explain the meaning of this:</p>
<p>Everyone is young. The young people in general are dissatisfied with the current situation of the country and society. Especially in this era of survival crisis, the mood of young people exceeds the word "dissatisfaction" by thousands of times.</p>
<p>Analysis of Dissatisfaction</p>
<p>Now, let's analyze these dissatisfied moods first. Let's remove the mood of dissatisfaction with the country and society due to the oppression of one's own life. Then, what remains is purely dissatisfaction with the current state of the country and society. This analysis is important. The former has selfish motives, while the latter is purely for the public good.</p>
<p>Then, let's analyze the dissatisfaction with the current state of the country and society. Let's first remove the [unclear] mood. Then, what remains is purely dissatisfaction arising from concern and love. This analysis is even more important. Contempt is fundamentally looking down on one's own country and society. As for being too sad and loving too deeply, and sighing and hating that one's own country and society are not as good as others, this is precisely loyalty to the country and society.</p>
<p>If there is a kind of dissatisfaction in the hearts of young people with their own country and society, and this dissatisfaction arises from public service and loyalty, then this dissatisfaction should be said to be needed by the country and society. Because of dissatisfaction, we seek progress. Because we seek progress, we are willing to work hard. If we identify a bright direction and move forward, we will be able to approach the light. The psychology of dissatisfaction is turned into a psychology of seeking progress. However, it is unknown when success will come, but progress is the process of success. Of course, there are many obstacles and many twists and turns in this process, but if the direction is not wrong, then in this process, every young person can endure difficulties, overcome difficulties, and continue to progress until success.</p>
<p>From this point of view, what young people need is a bright direction. With a bright direction, the mental strength of young people has a purpose. From dissatisfaction to hard work, from progress to success.</p>
<p>Where is the epoch-making significance that I just mentioned? In the past few decades, the so-called bright direction has gone from hesitation to firmness, from vagueness to clarity.</p>
<p>Why do I say this?</p>
<p>Direction Before and After the Founding of the Republic</p>
<p>Before the founding of the Republic, the direction that young people identified was ethnic [unclear]. At that time, young people in general were both pained by the perilous international situation, the partition of powers imminent, and pained by the corruption of the previous government. Due to this kind of dissatisfaction, they unknowingly focused their mental strength on ethnic [unclear]. Although some elements of civil rights and people's livelihood were also incorporated at that time, they were very thin, far less than the strong ethnic [unclear]. The main purpose of ethnic [unclear] at that time was to achieve equality among all ethnic groups within the country internally, and to achieve independence and autonomy of the Chinese nation externally. The Revolution of 1911 achieved equality among ethnic groups within the country in terms of political status, but externally, there were many obstacles and the goal could not be achieved. Looking back now, the ethnic [unclear] at that time really ignored an electric [unclear] factor. Ethnic [unclear] should take pan-Asianism as its core. China itself wants to achieve independence and autonomy, and at the same time, many ethnic groups in Asia also want to achieve independence and autonomy. With pan-Asianism, mutual unity and joint cooperation, the strength is more abundant, and the common enemies of British and American imperialism, who suppress and plunder the Asian nations and prevent them from achieving independence and autonomy, can be defeated. However, at that time, this point was ignored, and there was no unity with other ethnic groups in Asia, and even friction and conflict with each other. In this way, not only was the strength dispersed, but even the British and American imperialists took advantage of it to sow discord and make them go down the path of mutual slaughter. As a result, the goal of independence and autonomy became farther and farther away. As for this kind of responsibility, whether China is alone or shares it, it cannot but be admitted.</p>
<p>International Communism</p>
<p>The above is the fact before and after the founding of the Republic. As for the period around the tenth year of the Republic, the situation changed again. Young people in general, seeing that ethnic [unclear] could not achieve its purpose, believed that this direction was wrong. As a result, there was an attempt to find another direction. As a result, internationalism and communism took its place. Although the two doctrines are different, they have one thing in common, which is to oppose ethnic [unclear]. Internationalism believes that ethnic [unclear] is too narrow, and we should focus on the whole world and all mankind. Communism believes that ethnic [unclear] is unnecessary, and we should talk about class. As a result of the prevalence of these two doctrines, ethnic [unclear] was almost suffocated. Internationalists have a major [unclear]. He talked about the world, which seemed to be bigger than Asianism, bigger than the ethnic [unclear] of a country. In fact, he forgot whose world this is. Since the end of the last [unclear] war, world hegemony has been in the hands of Britain and the United States. Except for the Soviet Union, which was immersed in experimenting with communism, and Japan, which was immersed in preparations, temporarily silenced, there were only two trends in the world. One is: to follow Britain and the United States and slightly share the rest, such as France, etc. The second is: to be reduced to the status of a semi-colony and unable to extricate itself. Most of the countries that have failed to achieve independence and autonomy and the nations that have lost their freedom are. May I ask, in such a situation, what is the so-called world? Internationalists ignore this point, and as a result, they become the diaspora of pan-Asianism and ethnic [unclear], and at the same time become the proponents of British and American imperialism. As for the major [unclear] of communists, in only recognizing class and not recognizing the nation and nationality, the special struggles between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party since the fourteenth and fifteenth years of the Republic are precisely on this point. The Kuomintang believes that in the current economic situation, the industry has not yet developed, and the class opposition is not significant. Although the national wealth is uneven, compared internationally, it can be called small [unclear], which can be solved by developing national capital and implementing planned economy, without talking about class struggle. The Communist Party is not like this. They forcibly divide this uneven small poverty into countless classes, inciting one class to fight against other classes. As a result, the national self-destruction of the empty prison is created. Not only is the [unclear] of the country and the vitality of the nation destroyed, but under the concept of class, ethnic [unclear] and pan-Asianism are also abandoned. What is most regrettable is that Mao Zedong said in Chongqing in the past few years that Chinese society is in the shape of an olive core, with two small ends and a large middle. The so-called two small ends are that there is no large bourgeoisie at the top and no proletariat [unclear] at the bottom. The so-called large middle is that there are the most people in small and medium-sized industries. China should unite these small and medium-sized industrialists to fight for survival today. This is exactly what is called "Why bother in the first place?" If you had known this earlier, why bother causing national self-destruction of the empty prison and ruining the country to this point?</p>
<p>Despising the Nation and Nationality</p>
<p>Internationalists and communists have one thing in common, which is despising their own country and nationality. Internationalists admire the prosperity of Britain and the United States. Comparing China, they feel that everything is not as good as others. As a result, they despise their own country and nationality. Even their own ancestors are said to be "deeply guilty and harmed their descendants." In this way, all patriotism has been eradicated, and ethnic [unclear] has no attachment [unclear]. However, one's own country and nationality can be despised, but one's own personal position must be high. As a result, one unknowingly goes towards individualism. Since everything is good in Britain and the United States, it is natural that all personal enjoyment is good in Britain and the United States. Therefore, there are many foreign houses in the Shanghai Concession, and the daily life [unclear] is considered [unclear]. As for public undertakings and national defense incidents, no one asks. On the contrary, [unclear] in Japanese cities, the people seen still live in short wooden [unclear], and the food is still light [unclear], but public undertakings, especially national defense undertakings, are extremely developed. This is a very clear example. Although the behavior of communists is the opposite of that of internationalists, because they have the concept of despising their own country and nationality, they feel that everything in their own country and nationality is not good, and they will never have any nostalgia and will never cherish them. Therefore, they are bent on destruction, as far as possible. In short, if the internationalists and communists gain power, then ethnic [unclear] will be reversed, and the core pan-Asianism of ethnic [unclear] will also be impossible to mention. Because China is not as good as Britain and the United States, the entire Asia is not as good as Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>China is in the list of contempt, and Asia is also in the list of contempt. This is a natural conclusion. Chen Duxiu and Hu Shi discussed the entire national liberation: "This is trying to find perfume from the dung heap." That's right, Hu Shi boasted that he could find a little perfume from the [unclear] heap. Chen Duxiu thought that perfume did not have to be found from the dung heap. The two people had different opinions, but the starting point of regarding Chinese culture as an industry heap was really different. Since one's own country and nationality are the same as the dung heap, then why love him? (To be continued)</p>

<p>The Second Police General Bureau believes that raising poultry is a sideline production for farmers, and since it is not included in the scope of control, its transport should be free to increase the rural economy. However, it has been found that checkpoints along the way are not aware of this and have sometimes hindered and extorted, which is very inappropriate. In addition to ordering all its subordinate branch bureaus not to hinder in their respective jurisdictions, and to be subject to punishment if they do so, it has also ordered the Inspection Department of the Bureau to send officers at any time to railway stations, ports, and along the way to conduct strict inspections to alleviate merchants' difficulties.</p>

<h3 id="e27">Commentary: Increased Production of Cotton <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The day before the establishment of the Cotton Control Committee, we discussed industrial and economic policies, believing that how to increase the production of food and how to increase the production of cotton, so that the people's clothing and food during the war would not be a problem, is the most urgent, most important, and most worthy of research, discussion, and implementation today. The next day (November 27), at the inaugural meeting of the Cotton Control Committee, Allied Minister Tajiri of Japan also said, "In terms of materials in Central China, cotton and rice are the most important... I hope that the Cotton Control Committee will pay attention to how to increase production in the future."</p>
<p>The increased production of cotton, as Minister Su of Industry said on behalf of Executive Yuan President Wang that day, can both help the Greater East Asia War and benefit the country and the people. Because cotton is one of China's main agricultural products and an important material for industrial raw materials, its importance to people's livelihood is self-evident. Even if the government buys cotton yarn and cloth for distribution, if it cannot continue to work hard to manufacture cotton yarn and cloth, then the future of yarn and cloth distribution is bleak. Therefore, the increased production of cotton is the basic problem to implement the yarn and cloth distribution plan.</p>
<p>To seek increased cotton production, the most preliminary problem is to encourage its production and reproduction, and the most effective methods are: raise the price of buying cotton, so that farmers will be happy to engage in cotton production in the future; certify that the purchase funds truly enter the hands of farmers who produce cotton, so that their capital for reproduction is not lacking; and distribute cotton products from cities to farmers at low prices as much as possible, so that they can directly understand the meaning of increased cotton production and the close relationship between cotton and farmers. Based on the above three methods—all of which are parallel and not contradictory—the hope of increased cotton production is almost no problem. It is well known that the power of the Cotton Control Committee is by no means weak and that it can achieve the goal of increased production based on this policy.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Municipal Public Works Bureau Formulates Measures for Charging Rickshaw Fares <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that since the popularity of three-wheeled rickshaws in the city, various rental rickshaw companies have been established, and business is booming. The prices have all been approved by the authorities, and all rickshaw pullers' tips have also been included. However, in fact, rickshaw pullers often overcharge customers for tips. Although the bureau has repeatedly prohibited this, this bad habit has not been eradicated. In view of this, the Municipal Public Works Bureau has specially formulated measures for three-wheeled business rickshaws to charge fares and three types of rickshaw tickets, A, B, and C, and ordered all rickshaw companies to implement them uniformly starting next month, in order to effectively crack down on rickshaw pullers' extra demands. The measures are as follows:</p>
<p>Measures for Shanghai Special Municipality Three-Wheeled Business Human-Powered Rickshaws to Charge Fares and Tips: All three-wheeled business companies and all drivers shall abide by these measures when collecting fares. All companies shall prepare the following three types of tickets. Type A (the style is to be determined separately) consists of five or ten tickets per booklet. Passengers can directly obtain them from the companies. Each ticket is for thirty minutes. The fares and tips for double military personnel are clearly stated. If passengers travel to their destination and do not exceed the time on the ticket, they are not allowed to give any more money, and drivers are not allowed to demand any more tips. Type B (the style is to be determined separately) is for vehicles hired by passengers by telephone from the company. The driver will bring the fare and tips collection. Passengers should note the time of boarding and arrival, and should explain the time to the driver. The driver will write down the time and how much to charge, and give the first copy to the passenger for receipt, and the second copy to the company for settlement. If there are overcharges or extortion, passengers can report directly to the company. After receiving the passenger's report, the company shall not only double the amount of the extra extortion, but also punish the driver according to the military. Type C (the style is to be determined separately) is for when passengers pay the driver with Type A tickets, but the time exceeds the limit of the ticket. The driver will still bring and collect the fare and tips for the excess time. The driver should also write down how much the time has been exceeded and how much to charge, and still give the first copy to the passenger for receipt, and the second copy to the company for settlement. Passengers who go to the company to take a ride should first purchase a Type A ticket and hand it to the driver upon arrival. If the time is exceeded, they will collect it with a Type C ticket. If passengers pay the driver to collect the fare and tips, and the driver does not give a Type C ticket or a Type B ticket, the passenger may refuse to pay. If the company protects the driver and is found by the bureau, in addition to being fined, the license will also be revoked.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Hua Stock Trends <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The Securities Exchange officially opened yesterday. The market was lively and trading increased greatly. The stock market moved from high to low. The whole reason was that real accounts were forced to sell for cash at the end of the month. There was no shortage of large accounts supporting the market in the morning, so the decline was still small. In the afternoon, the supply was greater than the demand, and the decline was rapid. The decline in the various small-denomination stocks was still small. The old stocks were mostly small. However, Meiya Gangchang was uniquely prosperous due to the increase in silk prices. The sharpness of the rise was unexpected, and the number of transactions was especially huge. People's hearts were in a daze, and the future turned into a spin.</p>
<p>Textile Meiya Silk Factory initially saw a high price, and at one time there was a shortage of supply. Not long after, the buying frenzy rose, and the price rose sharply at noon. There was a daily level of rise. In the afternoon, it was initially flat. At the close, it rose even more, up a few cents from the previous day. Yong'an Textile was the opposite. The market was small, a few yuan. Zhongfang slowed down. Xinhe saw a slight decline. Wuhe, Huafeng, Xinfeng, and Meilun each fell about one yuan. Xinyi rose slightly. Dagong, Tianyuan, and Dazhong Textile were about the same price as the previous day. Jingfu Shirt was flat. The volume was slightly lower. The Chinese silk industry followed Meiya Silk Factory, and there was no shortage of sellers.</p>
<p>Department Stores Yong'an was down a small fraction. Xinxin and Guohuo were both down several yuan. Underwear was also down about one yuan. Guanghua Department Store was the same price. A lot of things did not hold and fell slightly.</p>
<p>New Medicine Zhongfa was closed and entered. The small state-owned Cheng was squeezed. Xinya also approached one yuan. Xinyi and Xinxing fell slightly. Zhongxi was the only one that rose. Wuzhou stayed flat.</p>
<p>Culture Zhonghua Book Company saw a high price again. The Commercial Press was flat. There were few sellers. The world saw a decline. Yongxiang Standard Paper Products were both held up. China Film circled to a flat price.</p>
<p>Public Utility Zhabei Water and Electricity and Huashang Electricity both opened at the customs port. Transportation Enterprises, Long Motor was flat. Public Utility Motor declined more vigorously.</p>
<p>Real Estate Linhua, Xin'yi, and Yonghe were each down about half a percent.</p>
<p>Other Nanyang Tobacco Company was uniquely strong. Dazhong Firecrackers returned low. Kangyuan also fell. Standard MSG was still flat. Jiu'an, Xinzhong, and Dahua Industrial were all being squeezed. Xinya Construction was flat in the morning and declined very little in the afternoon. Guohua Investment was also down half a percent. The global enterprise circled to a final flat price. Xinyihang had a rights issue. China Bricks and Tiles, Bao'an Glass, and Dahua all rose to a flat price after being exhausted.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Brief News <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>

<h3 id="e36">Various Problems in the Second Stage of the Commercial Control Committee's Work <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Insufficient Cooperation from Businesspeople</p>
<p>The second problem is that the Commercial Control Committee, which is supposed to be supported by businesspeople, is responsible for the movement of goods and the approval of removals, the collection, and the allocation of goods. However, some people in the business community have the wrong idea that a free economy will reappear, and they do not fully assist this policy, thus becoming a cause of speculation and hoarding. This is against the national capital and the assurance of production increase, and they specialize in collecting materials and turning them into "accumulated capital," which is completely contrary to the purpose. In order to break this situation, the Commercial Control Committee seems to reform its internal mechanisms internally and strengthen its ties with the national government externally. The reorganization of the Commercial Control Committee into the Executive Yuan means that it indirectly shifts non-cooperative capital into a cooperative direction, such as the forced collection of cotton yarn and cloth.</p>
<p>Relationship with Various Authorities</p>
<p>The reorganization of the Commercial Control Committee into the Executive Yuan is only a partial countermeasure. If the Commercial Control Committee can fully function, how should it proceed and how should it be resolved? This is today's theme. Regarding this point, the opinions of the powerful are as follows: 1. It seems that there is a tendency for the implementation of all material control operations by an autonomous-character agency to proceed smoothly. 2. Establish a system in which national capital guides national capital through the Commercial Control Committee. 3. Economic measures lack comprehensive planning. The following is a separate review: (From the Continental New Daily) To be continued</p>

<h3 id="e37">General Discussion (Continued from the Previous Page) <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Third, a tendency toward impartiality and non-partisanship gradually emerged within the tradition of party-based journalism, and gained unanimous support and affection from the public. This occurred after the first Diet session in Meiji 23 (1890). Along with the high tide of the democratic constitutional movement, the once so-called "major newspaper" party organs saw a sharp decline in their reputation. Newspapers such as *Jiji Shinpō*, *Asahi Shimbun*, *Nihon Shimbun*, and *Kokumin Shimbun*, which were impartial and non-partisan, gained the trust of the entire country and gradually became a new trend in Japanese newspapers. Fourth, there was a tendency towards national essence-ism, that is, anti-Westernization. The aforementioned *Nihon Shimbun* and *Kokumin Shimbun* newspapers began to create two major emerging forces, advocating internally to preserve traditional virtues and create a uniquely Japanese culture, and externally to assert national rights, so that all of Asia could gain independence from white domination. It can be said to be the ideological origin of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>The Russo-Japanese War led to further development of Japanese newspapers, just as this war laid the foundation for Japan's position as a first-class world power. The most noteworthy trend in the Japanese press during this era was the improvement in management and technology. Due to the development of the war, the dispatch of war correspondents and the reporting of war news began to meet the demands of the people across the country. Furthermore, due to wartime military secrets and communication difficulties, technological and management competition unfolded. Since the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese newspaper industry began to become a capitalist enterprise, began internal corporate organization, began to pay attention to advertising and distribution, and began to focus on improving equipment and editing skills. At the same time, evening editions and local editions also began to develop widely. More noteworthy was the development of communications enterprises. From then on, the Japanese newspaper industry established its important position in the world newspaper industry.</p>
<p>However, when did Japanese newspapers further take on the historical mission of the nation? Undoubtedly, it was from the era of World War I to World War II. After the outbreak of the First European War, Japanese news organizations advanced with the war, and the Japanese newspaper industry also developed with the prosperity of the economic world. At that time, news became the center of competition in the press, and people from all walks of life across the country paid close attention to it, because the movements of the European War had the closest relationship with the development of the Japanese economy and even national power. After the First European War, Japanese public opinion organs advanced simultaneously with open diplomacy. Taking the Paris Peace Conference as an example, the chief plenipotentiary representative of Japan at that time was Elder Kinmochi Saionji, as well as ambassadors stationed in Britain, France, Italy, and other countries. The special correspondents dispatched by major newspapers and the commissioned special correspondents from local newspapers numbered as many as fifty! They contacted the conference representatives and domestic public opinion to support the country's diplomacy! Later, such as the First International Labor Conference, the Washington Conference, and the Disarmament Conference, they all cooperated with diplomacy, demonstrating the power of Japanese public opinion, and展开 (zhǎn kāi -展开)展開熱烈 (rè liè -熱烈)的 (de -的)競賽 (jìng sài -競賽)熱烈的 competition with newspaper operators from Britain and the United States. In August 1927, the League of Nations convened the "International Conference of News Experts," and Japanese representatives were particularly active, striving to pass their proposals and consolidate the position of the Japanese newspaper industry in the world.</p>
<p>In the past ten years, the Japanese newspaper industry has entered a new era, which can generally be said to be the early stage of the controlled era. The main thing during this period was the birth of the "News Agency." Since the Japanese newspaper industry established its international position, it has since展开 (zhǎn kāi -展開)國際 (guó jì -國際)的 (de -的)活動 (huó dòng -活動)展開ed international activities. Japan's international news had always been dominated by Reuters. At this point, it sought to break free. The first step was to sign a contract with Reuters in 1922 to maintain Japan's autonomy in international news. Later, the International News Agency further strengthened its autonomy, and its president, Iwanaga Yanosuke, personally went to Moscow to negotiate with the Soviet state-run Rosta News Agency (now TASS News Agency) and successfully established an equal communication contract. He then went to London and New York to meet with Melville Stone, the founder of the Associated Press, to learn about its history, organization, and operation for the purpose of emulation in his own country. After returning to China, he consulted with the executives of major newspapers such as *Asahi*, *Mainichi*, *Chugai*, *Hochi*, *Kokumin*, and *Jiji Shinpō* to eliminate unnecessary competition and form a powerful news front. After continuous efforts, in January 1926, the International News Agency and the eight major newspapers, *Hochi*, *Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun*, *Tokyo Asahi Shimbun*, *Chugai*, *Kokumin*, *Jiji Shinpō*, *Osaka Asahi Shimbun*, and *Osaka Mainichi Shimbun*, emulated the organizational structure of the American Associated Press and established the "Japan Small Newspaper Union." In October 1931, it merged "Rengo" and "Dentsu" to establish Japan's first national representative news agency, "Corporate Juridical Person Domei News Agency."</p>
<p>When we review the history of the development of newspapers in Japan over the past fifty years, we can at least recognize the following points: First, the Japanese newspaper industry is closely related to the strength and development of the country, and is operated as an enterprise for the country and the people, based on the premise of the country and society. Second, the Japanese press competes with each other in terms of management organization, equipment, technology, and talent recruitment, but they are consistent in their contributions to the country, nation, and social undertakings. Third, Japanese newspaper operators and employees must not simultaneously hold government official positions or operate other businesses other than newspapers. At the same time, government officials and people from all walks of life other than newspapers must not operate newspapers or other news-related businesses. Therefore, the Japanese newspaper industry has had sound development and can exert its power of public opinion. Fourth, although the Japanese newspaper industry is operated as a capitalist enterprise and has had elements of profit-seeking, under the national policy, especially during wartime, it absolutely sacrifices and struggles under the goal of "national supremacy" and "public interest first," resolutely rejecting everything that is harmful to the country and public interest. Conversely, for everything that is beneficial to the country and public interest, it will do it even if the newspaper suffers some economic losses. Fifth, we must especially point out the Japanese authorities' "respect for freedom of speech" and "newspaper guidance policy." In a passive sense, as long as it is not detrimental to the country and public interest, there will be no arbitrary prohibitions or easy interference with the words and deeds of the newspaper industry. In an active sense, it will do its best to support and guide it, so that the newspaper industry has sound and proper development. Whether in terms of human resources, technology, or material (such as paper) allocation, it is very reasonable and universal, because there are only newspapers for the country and only newspapers for the people, and no newspapers for a certain faction or individual of the government. Therefore, even during wartime, the Japanese newspaper industry still presents a state of progress and can shoulder the historical mission!</p>
<p>"The pen of justice and the sword of righteousness, together fighting for the motherland and East Asia!" We express our infinite admiration for the sacrifices and struggles of the Japanese press seniors, and we cannot help but have ardent expectations for the domestic press.</p>
