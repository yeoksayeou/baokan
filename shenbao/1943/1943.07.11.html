<h3 id="c1">留學制度之檢討與商榷 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 章超</p>
<p>據中央社消息，日本駐華大使谷正之氏於六月二十六日會見記者時，曾談到確立中國青年赴日留學制度之問題。就這一點來說，可知日本目前所推行之對華新政策，不僅偏重在政治經濟方面，同時亦顧到文化教育。願藉此劃時代的機會，將過去及未來的留學制度之一股，加以檢討和商榷，以供我國敎育界之參考，亦所以答謝友邦之雅意</p>
<p>過去留學制度之檢討　當我國海通之初，先知先覺之士盱衡時勢審度國情，深知科學及技術之重要，非急起直追，不足以自立立人，而完成我國所應負之國際使命。因此有遺派留學生之舉，以期截長補短借助他山，法至善而意至深。無如當時之交通工具尙未發達，遠涉重洋，人皆視爲畏途而裏足不前。於是對於大選方面難求嚴格。甚或不問其年齡品學是否適合，採用誘掖方法凑集名額。在此創辦時期中，留學歸國之人數甚少，而成績亦高下不齊。其中雖不無俊俊者，實學致用，然多數不免虛有其名。一得留學名銜，極易廁身官階，故覬覦豔羡者，頗不乏人。由此風氣丕變，視留學爲顯貴之捷徑。縉紳之家，不復問其子弟之智愚，必以資送留學爲畢生之宏顧。不待官費之頒給，寗傾私囊，且有不待其子弟體力與智力之成熟，竟以十七八歲之中學生遺令留學。其迫不及待之情緒，可憫亦復可笑。而留學之弊端，亦即根伏於此。從此留學生之人數，與日俱增。淺見之流，論量不論質，根據統計之數字，慶幸中國敎育之進步，初不知留學生之程度，正因此而每况愈下。幸國人不乏識高見遠之士，鑒此危機，力謀矯正，於是官費公費之考送，固須力求嚴格，即私費生亦有向敎育部申請領取留學證書之規定，意在經過審查，可加限制。奈推行不力，成效不彰。狡黠之輩，根本規避，亦從未聞因此而受取締者，徒多一番手續，政府自損尊嚴。嚴格言之，以往固無所謂留學生制度，惟其遺送過濫，故在國外求學之情形，亦復錯綜復雜，年齡較長根底較深者，志趣亦較堅定，讀書亦較切實，但如鳳毛麟角，不可多覩。其次則渾渾噩噩敷衍塞責，以學位爲目的，以留學爲形式者，爲數最多。下焉者，荒嬉學業，習尙浮華，甚者自命倜儻，羣相誇競，近墨則黑，相習成風，凡留學生俱能道其詳，無煩贅述。雖曾有委派大員就地監督之議，祇以推行未遍，實施未周，亦無成效可言。此外，因遺送過濫，歸國致用之情形，亦復漫無統系，官費生公費生歸國以後，每不知從何着手以供獻其所學，私費生更無論矣。眞才實學之士，有遭擯斥而潦倒以終。徒盜虛聲之輩反居要津。遺派留學生之動機，欲其救國，而留學生之一般昭示於吾人之影象適得其反。數十年來，留學生制度未經確立，實有以致之。</p>
<p>對於留學制度之商榷　在談留學制度之前，應先具備兩項必要之條件、（甲）國內之敎育健全。（乙）執行留學制度者之修養高超。就甲項言之，各國敎育必各有其一貫之政策而各具特色。若以留學爲大學畢業後升學之途徑，或以留學而代替國內之大學敎育，皆非辦理敎育之正軌，更不能據此而確立留學制度。就乙項言之，任何制度之效果，緊於施行制度之人，人存政舉，人亡政息，自占皆然。倘施行留學制度者不明其自身責職之重大，而利用其地位壟斷營私，則制度雖經確立，亦無以見其成效。在此甲乙兩項條件之下，就管見所及，擬具留學制度之大綱如次：一、設立留學生管理處，舉凡一切甄　遣送督察考核推荐調查統計等事項，皆集中於此。於必要時，由處特派留學專員，就地負照料協助以及指導監督之責。二、無論官費公費或自費生，均以國內大學畢業，三育健全，並曾在相當機關連續服務三年以上，爲最低之資格（有特殊天才或貢獻者，不在此例。）三、凡政府機籣或私人企業需要特殊人才時，應先向管理處申請調用，倘無以供應，然後由處公開招選，錄取合於最低資格者若干人，是爲初選。初選合格，再須從事於兩項畢備工作：（甲）熟諳所需要之外國語，（乙）將出國後所指定研究之問題，儘量在國內加以探討，並須於指定之時間內完成。管理處就初選及格之人數中依據此甲乙兩項之成績。擇尤選定所需要派送之人數，是爲復選。私費留學亦須經初選之手續，並須呈騐合於複選之成績，惟研定之問題得自由選擇。四、遺派留學生不必預爲規定期限，視需要而定。名額亦不以機關或學科爲單位。費用亦不固定多寡，以有伸縮性爲原則，以期留學之效率，不受經濟之牽掣。至於留學時間之久暫，事前雖預爲估計，但有增減之餘地。一切處置均由管理處負責籌劃進行，而駐在國之專員竭力協助，使無缺憾。自費生自籌之費用須有保證，且須分期繳存管理處，代爲支配發給，與官費公費初無二致。務使在國外留學之青年，旣不必分心於經濟上及生活上之籌慮，更不致因過於優俗而墮落。凡　青年皆國家命脈之所繫，不得因其自費生而歧視。五、官費或公費生學成歸國，即服務於所需要之機關，自費生則須先向管理處登記，遇有適當機關，儘先推荐。至於施行時之細則規程，固可根據上列之大綱，加以釐訂，然非本文範圍所能詳論。留學生除研究所規定之問題，以貢於國內之各界外，同時負有國際間文化交流之使命，是亦值得吾人注意者。</p>

<p>東京十日中央社電　本月五日在新　治亞及可倫班加拉西島之白晝戰與庫拉灣夜戰中，日水軍戰隊所屬驅逐艦數艘。暨該地日陸海軍守備隊等，曾擊沉敵艦三艘，巡洋艦一艘重創巡洋艦一艘。此巳由日大本營於七日發表，茲擾日大本營十日發表所稱。依據其後之說報，是役除獲得以上戰果外，並已證實又普擊沉敵特務艦一艘，至該受傷起火之乙級巡洋艦，亦巳沉沒，蓋根據其後所者，七月四日曾擊沉，最近就役之新銳艦聖大非型乙級巡洋艦一艘。斯　倫古型大型巡洋艦一艘，艦型不詳者一艘，而是日夜戰中日水軍戰隊。復曾斷然向敵軍實施肉搏攻擊，以魚雷擊沉敵乙級巡洋艦赫勒拿號，視此次戰鬥經過，可敿敵艦隊確曾因日驅逐艦隊之活躍。而曾陷於恐懼，欲圖逃避，但當其確認日艦隊僅爲驅逐艦時，乃復又充滿自信，於是夜屬驅逐艦之奮勇作戰，深入敵艦隊陣內，故結果乃復獲得如此所發表之戰果，而經此一戰，敵艦隊當已經知日水軍戰隊之勇猛可畏。</p>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日　　軍各部隊，自上月三十日美軍開始反攻倫特巴島新佐治亞島方面　　　，經本月四五兩日之庫拉灣海戰以迄七日敵軍攻擊魯比亞納島止，　　　歷八日，總計所獲戰果，根據日大本營之發表，可統計如下：擊沉者有乙級巡洋艦四艘，大型驅逐艦五艘，驅逐艦一艘，特務艦一艘，魚雷艇一艘，艦型不詳者一艘，運輸船十二艘，擊燬者有乙級巡洋艦一艘，驅逐艦一艘，魚雷艇一艘，前後共計擊沉擊毀敵艦船廿八艘，此外擊沉敵舟艇甚　，又擊落敵　一五九架以上。</p>
<p>里斯本十日中央社電　墨爾　錄自反軸心軍南太平洋總司令部公布稱，強大之日戰鬥機編隊，於日昨猛襲倫特巴島，該官報又謂，日轟炸機襲擊新幾內亞東部之反軸心地，至所受之損失，則並未提及云。</p>
<h3 id="c3">庫斯克德裝甲部隊突破蘇軍陣地　雙方運用大量砲隊飛機作空前大規模劇烈戰鬥 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>斯德哥爾摩十日中央社電　蘇軍之坦克隊，雖殊死作戰，　阻遏德軍之楔形進入庫斯克南之蘇軍陣地，但傳備軍之突破蘇軍陣線，巳更爲推廣。海通社昨晚柏林消息稱，庫斯克之戰，昨日巳達第五日，其性質與星期四相較，並無變動，大批最新式之坦克車，如德方之虎形坦克車及改良之蘇方T-34式坦克車，在貝爾哥洛特及庫斯克間，暨由勒爾以南之地區博戰，蘇軍戰略，係欲以坦克車攻擊。繼之以步兵進攻，以企圖截斷德軍之部隊，結果遂發生劇烈戰鬥。但據柏林方面傳，德軍達到其目的，蘇方曾集中大量之砲隊及排砲於兩處焦點，德方亦以砲隊作空前大規模之戰鬥，故現進雙方砲戰之激烈。爲此次戰爭中所創見。溫通社　事記者昨晚評論稱。此次雙方所運用之大量坦克車砲隊及飛機，巳可仗庫斯克之戰役，爲整修戰事中之最大戰鬥，雙方皆不斷增派生力軍作戰。柏林方面稱，昨日被毀之蘇方坦克車及飛機，巳超出一千之數，但據信在貝爾哥洛特地區指揮之洛科索夫斯基將軍尚有更多之坦克車準備，以供其調遣，　通社指出德軍指揮部對坦克車作戰，巳採取新戰術。裝甲部隊之前鋒突破梯形之蘇軍陣線後，並不忽促深入內部，而從事推廣其決口，並編配陣地。海通社稱，德軍裝甲部隊，自貝爾哥洛特北向庫斯克六十公里處突破後，又以一陣坦克車，擊破貝爾哥洛特之蘇軍東部防線，將德軍之楔形向諾維奧斯科爾方面推廣，蘇軍對抗德軍突破之　一方法。爲攻擊德軍之側　，但德軍指揮部，　　計及此項可能，無論如何，洛科索夫斯基將軍所部坦克車隊，巳遭遇德方因驅逐機及戰鬥機協助之強大裝甲後備隊，　軍之空軍優勢，亦爲蘇方之作戰計劃，無由實現，路透社駐莫斯科記者昨晚承認謂，蘇方之危險地區爲貝爾哥洛物庫斯克間之某處地區。該處之備裝甲部隊，巳擊破蘇軍之防線云。蘇官方尚未宣布戰區之　確地位，但擾悉德軍之主要進攻，係尚貝爾哥洛特至庫斯克之主要路線，或係與該路線平行云。</p>
<h3 id="c4">日報著論評述　庫斯克戰事 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　名古屋中部日本新聞十日社論，曾以德蘇攻防戰之性格爲題，評述庫斯克地區戰事之將來性格稱，東線德蘇兩軍，本月五日拂曉，以南部戰線北端庫斯克突出部爲中心，開始冬有戰　終了以來最大之攻防戰，據前線消息，兩軍兵力均在百萬，動員戰車及飛機均達千數以上，其規模之宏大，實與去年秋之中丹林格勒大攻防戰不相上下。當此次作戰開始時，德軍當局曾宣稱，係　蘇軍先發動攻勢，而蘇聯情報局則謂，係　德軍先發動攻勢，因雙方之完全相違，故其真相，難於明瞭。然德蘇兩軍利用過去百日間之膠著時期，於該方面續增強兵力，窺俟機會，以圖進攻，此實至爲顯明。故德蘇兩軍保方先發動攻勢，並不足重視，其主要者乃在於何方能首先獲得戰局之主導性。而後始繼續攻擊者，據目下之戰況判斷，戰局之主導性，握於德軍之手。蘇聯方面對此似亦　承認。關於機甲力及空軍力，空軍均佔絕對之優勢，以此而論，則戰局之大勢，巳行決定矣。關於現在之作戰，是否即德軍之夏季攻勢，議論亦屬紛紜，吾吾人試觀地圖，即可知庫斯克西文蘇軍陣地，有突出的達三百公里之形態，由來突出陣地，居於備動，故其配置之兵力，較被動方面爲少，德軍爲前補此缺陷，乃必須將庫斯克地勢之突出戰線敉平，而使之成爲直線，此次之德軍作戰，自以上所言者視之，係採取局部之陣地強化戰，似無實行大規模全面攻擊戰之意向。此據德軍當局數次所言明者，即可明瞭。總之反軸心軍使入歐洲作戰，能否實現，尚屬疑問，然其朝廷準備，巳屬事實，德軍決不能仍如去年夏傾全力於東線作攻勢，使其兵力僅集結於東線，予反軸心軍登陸之機會，故如去年夏季間之攻勢，本年度或不能實現，但庫斯克突出部分之作戰，今後必角繼續展開，故本年夏季之德軍攻勢，縱與去年夏季攻勢於性質規模上均完全不同。然其爲夏季攻勢則未改變云。</p>
<h3 id="c5">西西里島發生登陸戰　軸心軍猛烈抵抗　敵遭受慘重損失 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>羅馬十日中央社電　美軍司令部於十日發表戰報，　反軸心軍於九日在海軍艦艇及空軍之掩護下，令傘兵部隊降陸，開始進攻西西里島。　軸心軍竭力抵抗敵軍，刻在西西里島東　沿岸與敵軍激戰中，　九日反軸心機空擊西西里島時，被宙心軍地上砲火擊落二十二架，其中十五架係在埃貝特克被擊落者，又德戰鬥機隊擊落敵機十一架。　義空軍雷擊繼曾在突尼西亞沿岸水哉轟炸敵方商船三艘，予以重創。</p>
<p>里斯本十日中央社電　海通社錄自倫敦之華生報，反軸心軍已於今晨，開始在西西里島登陸，該項登陸軍隊，內有英美及加拿大軍，均由北非反軸心軍總司令美人艾森霍華將軍指揮。</p>
<p>柏林十日中央社電　此間軍界人士，頃宣稱，在西西里島東南海岸登陸之反軸心軍，經軸心防禦軍奮勇作戰後，遭受極慘重之損失，軸心軍海防砲壘與轟炸機，曾予敵滿載軍隊之登陸船舶及運輸　以重創。</p>
<p>柏林十日中央社電　德國新聞社特派員柏拉納著論稱，英美巳彼此分配其在地中海所擔任之任務。俱係　由英國擔任自地中海東部向歐洲進攻，而美國則從地中海之醅開始活動。反軸心指揮部在極力掩飾其軍隊之行動。從反軸心之新聞及宣傳政策中，巳可顯見此項事實據云。在過云數星期間，反軸心指揮部，曾大事調動軍隊，有許多部隊，巳自突尼西亞東部，轉移至地中海東部，此舉一方面係　耱供與分配之便利，一方面係　在軸心轟炸範圍以外之地區，補充其業巳疲乏之隊伍，而最重要者，斟爲減少英美之磨擦云。</p>
<p>（英人急盼實現攻歐）</p>

<p>— 德富豬一郎（二）</p>
<p>至愛德華七世時代，猶太的勢力更接近宮庭。愛德華七世至七十歲時尚是皇太子，他的周圍聚集著各種各樣的化合物。其中有賭徒，有投機者，有金融業者，有騎師，不遑一一枚舉，就中有薩，阿納斯特，卡塞爾者，可稱爲他的密友。他是猶太的金融業者，在英國是著名的富豪，曾有人說後太子的機密費用，恐有若干也是他所支付的。因而自受德華七世踐祚後，當然仍在他的身邊爲一有勢力者。日俄戰爭時，日本募集公債，他與紐約的猶金融業者希夫昆，洛勃等互相響應，應募公債，出力不少，這自然是出於愛德華七世的授意，我們不必妄費臆測。</p>
<p>皮過來看宮廷以外的猶太的勢力，英國二大政黨保黨與自由黨，其若干黨費均賴猶太人支付，這是不容置疑的。雖巧爲掩飾，然於馬可尼無綫電報事件，一時曾爲震撼英國政界的大事，英國自由黨內閣幾因此崩潰。今不必在這里詳述始末的必受。極簡單地說來，一九一二年三月七日，當時的遞信大臣薩繆爾，曾對馬可尼公司　付無綫電報的公事。薩繆爾自然是猶太系的政治家，即在日本，亦曾在著他的同族薩繆爾石油公司的支店。</p>
<p>而且那馬可尼公司的總經理果特佛萊，伊薩克斯，也是猶太系的英人，他的兄弟魯非斯，伊薩克斯，當時是自由黨阿司奪斯內閣的檢察長，是內閣的法律大顧問。受遞信大臣吩咐的總經理果特佛萊，伊薩克斯，啣命赴美，懷著美國馬可尼公司的十萬股票而歸，出管於倫敦市塲。在此以前，他曾與其兄弟哈利及當時的檢察長魯非斯秘密會見，諮問他的二個兄弟擬以每股一鎊十六先令的價格分配之。哈利在這里取五萬六千股，而魯非斯再從哈利那里以每股二磅的價格收買一萬股。然而當時的財政大臣勞合、喬治、即以其資金提供遞信大臣薩繆爾，而由勞合、喬治及財政部的議會次官保管之作自由學的秘密費。愛理彭當時也參與此事。</p>
<p>一九一二年四月，此咱股票以三磅五先令的價格公開於市塲。因之，總經理果特佛萊、哈利、伊薩克斯兄弟及勞合、知治、愛理彭等大家都出賣那各股票，而得到了不少的利益。愛理彭不僅是自己的財産，且使用了自由黨的秘密費，而又得到了更多的利益，於是在一九一二年七月遞信大臣薩繆爾與馬可尼公司總經理果特佛萊、伊薩克斯之間的約束的承認案，提出於下院，問題就在這里起來了。此後的紛擾，不及詳述、勞合、喬治第一時毫不知悉，致無法可想，其調查委員選定後，檢察長魯非斯、伊薩克斯秘密與委員會面，明白告知不僅自身，即北閣僚亦與此事有關係。說勞合、喬治如其勢指此事，毋寧爲一種損失。並甚至把妻子的貯金賬也公開於法庭，當英國從事南非蒲亞之役時，張伯倫一家爲軍火公司的大股東而獲得不當利益，那里勞合、喬治也曾在下院提出彈劾的動議。所謂昨是而今非者，大約就是指這種事而言吧！不久也就虎頭蛇尾，烟花消雲散。這自然是英國政府大事化小事，小事化無事的成功。</p>
<p>魯非斯、伊薩克斯是他一家兄弟三人中的最小一個，當初曾盤桓股票市塲當經紀人之類的東西，曾經引起了有關刑事問題的事件，而意外地消除了，於是遂立志爲法律家，做律師，入議院，漸獲成功，竟一帆風順的做到印度總督，封萊琴格侯爵，比狄斯瑞利之爲伯爵比起來，更陞了一級。他最後成爲英國高等法院的民事部長，凡是一個政黨黨員所應得的，他巳完全具備了，而且占了政黨以外的超然官職，而保持至放後。他所以至此地步者，他的才力自然不必說，然而比此更甚的，我們不要忘記，那就是他的猶太的本能。（翔譯自六月二十四日醅每日新聞）</p>

<p>小倉團長答詞　經濟使節團長小倉答詞稱，本人等一行此次來華原承上　聯誼會及東亞經濟懇談會華中本部同志之熱誠執行，殊深欣怏，且藉此獲得與各位經濟界權威相聚一堂坦白交換意見尤當引以怏慰，比聆聞蘭亭先生及陳紹嬀先生兩位之歡迎詞，實表深厚之謝意，大東亞戰爭發生後，中日兩國巳站於同一戰線共謀東亞　秩序之建設，惟欲澈底建設東亞新秩序。則首先須完　戰爭，而完　戰爭，更須先行確立戰時經濟體制始能達到目的，中日兩國，因而必須在經濟上緊密提携合作共同努力而完成此偉大使命，此次本人等來華之最大目的，亦即打算與中國經濟界人士開誠布公交換意見，並從事討論覓取中日經濟提携之　體解決方案，本人等來華後，巳先後與貴團經濟界人士接觸，並曾數　會談，獲知上海方面亟待解決之經濟問題殊多，故本人常盡最大努力協助解決此種問題，並當向石渡　　徵詢意見，至中日經濟界合作提携之實現，正如聞氏所云「精誠所至金石爲開」如能下最大決心任何難題均能迎刃而解。猶　中國故事有李廣射石之證，可知一下決心，頑石爲開，　可爲我人借鏡也，最後並歡迎中國經濟界人士亦能組織考察團赴日考察，俾互相瞭解澈底合作云浮。</p>
<p>中日會員演詞　工商聯誼會副理事長小室　健夫因病，由常務理事藤野氏，代表日方會員致詞，略謂日本經濟使節團此次來華出席，今日之聯歡會，與在　中日經濟人之精神打成一片殊堪熱制導，上海工商聯誼會係中日經濟界人士互相合作的集會，此次小倉團長等一行來華同人等無不引爲感謝，中日兩國爲敢接近之國家。如能推誠合作，必能爲東亞發揚光大，故今日除實行聯歡外，　　重大之責任，我人當作更進一步之認識加緊努力達成最後目的。</p>
<p>張一鵬演說詞　繼由張一鵬氏代表中國會員，致詞謂今天歡迎日本使節團，聽　小倉團長坦白趨勢的表示，使我們非常的興奮，從經濟立志上觀察，像中日兩國的天時地力物力，可以得最最適宜於合作的天然條件，倡經濟合作，必須具備兩個要件。一曰誠意，一方出於勉強，表面難似合作，內容必有衝突，一旦互惠，倘然此方要多佔便宜，處方必然缺望，亦不發生合作的効力。就巳過事實來講。日本到中國以後，上海及附近的大都市，工廠很多，當時多盼望日本人來合作，可是合作的方法，規定中國人佔醬總額百分之四幹群，日本人佔百分之五十一。而且日本人把代管費用修理費用開出單子來，無不多不出一文。可以得到百分之五十一，這是經濟合作的一大障礙，等到將近成功時候，中國工廠，第一需要的是日本技術人才，至於監督管理人才，還在其次。烹結果，派到工廠的，多是屬於監督管理方面，而　於技術的反寥寥無幾，所以很感到撚，這是經濟的又一障礙。此次各位費了許多精神和光陰，當然要得到圓滿的解決。前車之覆，後車之鑒，纔敢不避忌諱，牽直奉告，以備參考。</p>
<p>陳日平氏演說　旋工商聯誼會兼東亞經濟懇談會會員陳日平氏亦起立致詞，深盼經濟使節團能改善調　中日之經濟，並努力除云浮中國之障礙，以期獲得圓滿之結果云浮。</p>
<p>石渡顧問演詞　略謂：戰時經濟政策，無論在中日兩國政府，如無民間經濟界之協力決無良好成就，今日集中日民間經濟界領袖人士於一堂，常能有良好之收穫　　政府，目前中國之最嚴重問題，當爲「物價問題」，尤其是上海物價問題，本人前與周財長視察各地，即如漢口情形，較上海爲佳，任何戰時國家物價高漲，固然難免，但中國物價情形，更爲嚴重。因物價之暴漲，商人以爲　獲相當利益，須知其他物價亦漲，結果並不能獲得若何利益，爲一時小我之利，而忽視整修大局，實爲至愚。但解決此項「物價問題」，最重要者還在民間之協力，如日本之民間物價協力會議，業巳與政府合作，而在抑低物價上獲致良好之成果，亞洲國亦有類此之民間協辦，工商聯誼會係上海工商界最有力之組織，如能協力政府解決嚴重之「物價問題」相信必能有偉大之貢獻，且對中日兩國之民生問題亦有莫大之稗益，而將來工商聯誼會對政府提供意見，亦必能爲政府當局採納云浮云浮。</p>
<p>全團赴京懇談　日本經濟使節團定於十二日赴京，拜見汪主席，　總司令官，谷大使後，將與實業、財政、糧食、各部部長，全國經委會委員，及各團係要人懇談經濟，與外交、教育、兩部長懇談文化問題，並與石渡顧問交換意見，參拜雨花台中山陵。</p>
<p>明石談新經濟　日本經濟使節團來華後，各方酬酢頗繁，開誠懇談經濟問題之解決方策，各方對會談之結果與內容，期待甚殷。頃據使節團員東京銀行集合所會長明土政策照男氏稱：新經濟政策之本義，在於保護扶助中國民族資本積極提携，亦未盡保護扶助中國民族資本之資，今後爲使扶育中國民族資本，日本之資本，必須提供於足使華方可能活動之新經濟分野上。職是之故，我經擔負金融意中人工作者，關於此點，願與中國金融巨擘開誠懇談，準備排隊妨礙民族資本成長之點。金融合作成功後，其他經濟意中人之問題，亦能解決矣。</p>

<p>昨日下午上海工商聯誼會，東亞經濟懇談會華中本部聯合茶會招待日本經濟使節團，國府最高經濟顧問石渡莊太郎氏蒞會參加，並發表演說。我們對於石渡氏的卓見，表示與同意。</p>
<p>石渡顧問演詞的主要點：　戰時經濟如果沒有民間經濟界充分協力，不會得厔預期效果的。　中國經濟問題中最嚴重的是物價問題，尤其是上海的物價問題，即如漢口情形當較上海爲佳。戰時國家的物價高漲，固然難免，但中國的物價情形則更爲嚴重。　日本與滿洲國均有民間組織以協力政府抑平物價而收效，上海工商聯誼會爲最有力的民間經濟團體，應積極負起此種責任。</p>
<p>關於這三點也是我們一貫的主張，第一點不但經濟方面如此，即政治方面也非得人民協力，不能強化，第二點我們曾屢次強調指出上海物價問題有呼應關繋，我們十分贊成石渡顧問的意見，而不希望工商聯誼會祇以「聯誼」爲事，舉行招待會歡迎會，即算盡其使命。我們希望該會負起協力抑平物價的責任，發揮民間團體的積極性能。不勝翹首以待。</p>

<h3 id="c43">「適當機關」 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>工商局物資統制成處長稻垣登氏前日向新聞記者稱：「本埠缺乏適當執行權力之機關，以懿付一般不法牟利之奸商。」並據指稱：「爲救濟本埠一般平民，對團積　利者之取締，其懲罰稅則亦需要予以整理。」</p>
<p>由於前一節的表示，我們可以想見上海物資編制工作，雖巳辦理有時，雖有工部局啓政當局的支持，仍然感覺不能應付囤積的猖獗和物價的暴漲；由於後一節的表示，我們可以覺到取締囤積，非但執行的職權，未能統一和發揮，並且懲罰的規則，亦覺不夠嚴厲。</p>
<p>我們深切同情於稻垣登氏意見之餘，希望在公共租界與法租界收囘以後，由於警　統一的事實關係，益以力量表現的精神作用，纔能夠組織一個適當機關出來，切實執行取締囤積的職權，並且嚴厲整理懲罰囤積的規則。所謂「有治法，無治人」的缺憾，必須予以彌補；所謂「治亂國，用重刑」的原則，必須予以資行。</p>

<p>本市各金融機關，爲符合財政當局強化戰時經濟機構之決意，在本年七月一日以後之六個月限期內，實行增資或合併，規定股份有限公司或股份兩合公司組織之銀行，包括錢莊銀號銀公司及借託公司，其資本總額至少須達六百萬元。再按公司法規定先收二分之一計三百萬元，即可營業。查過去規定資本額爲五十萬元，因此各金融機關紛紛按照新軍增資，頃據上海社記者調查在過去一星期內，錢莊增資者遠較銀行爲多，因小銀行等大抵已在五六兩月份內先後增資，而錢莊較遲，自七月一日以來，錢莊奉財部令改爲股份有限公司組織，增資至三百萬元或三百萬元以上者，巳有多家，而正在進行召集股東會商議增資者亦不在少，　如新銀行或新錢莊亦有設立，其資本按照新規定，至少收足最低額之半數，始准營業。以言合併一事，原則上雖能成立，惟以各金融機關有其個別之特殊性，實行合併困難殊多，故以後顯將以增資爲惟一途徑。查金融機關修正之最低資本額，　股份有限或兩合公司組織者六百萬元，　無限公司組織者二百萬元，　普通商業銀行兼營信託業務者五百萬元，（內銀行即資本三百萬元信託部資本二百萬元）。</p>

<h3 id="c50">復興絲業與安定民生 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— 天達</p>
<p>吾華本以農業立國，農産品除食糧而外，以絲蘭爲最着，且爲輸出大宗。以吾國統計材料缺乏，對於歷年蠶絲之産量，迄無凖確數字，據民國十八年海關報告，輸出生絲有十八萬九千餘担，以現值每担六萬元計，約值國幣一百餘萬萬元，國內綢廠㹉用，及土絲制品尚不內，若併入計算，數值之龐大，必更篤入。</p>
<p>軍興以還，各種工廠毀損甚巨，絲廠當然亦難倖免。至殘存未毀之廠基，其在蘇浙滬三地者，自二十七年起，爲友邦華中蠶絲公司獨佔營業，計江蘇省十四廠，（無錫二十蘇州二）浙江省七廠，（杭州二長安二嘉興二硤石一）上海市二廠，總計二十三廠，絲車七千四百七十六部，每月生絲生産最約三千担之譜，自三十年起，營業情形，漸見減退，現在繼續開工中者，蘇浙滬三處，僅餘六廠，絲車兩千餘部矣。</p>
<p>在同一期間，上海租界新興絲廠，有二十八所，以原料採集困難，如曇花一現，不久即盡行停閉。至散佈內地之小型製絲，達三百餘家，以無錫爲最多，但資本短拙，設備簡陋，且倐設倐拆，隨時而變，不過適應非常環境下之一種變態手工企業，聊博蠅頭，苟延殘喘而巳。</p>
<p>查蠶絲爲吾國國粹，又爲吾國農民數千年來唯一之副業，廼降及今茲每況愈下，國計民生，影響至巨。今庚春蘭收穫量，據報載江蘇省約幹蘭五萬餘担，浙省尚無此數，但歷年浙省産蘭，向較蘇省爲多，故浙省近年蘭産之減少，較蘇省爲尤甚，考今春滿産至洗減少之原因，係由於蠶種缺乏所致，大好桑葉，委葉於地，殊覺可惜，惟歷年因絲價不穩定，蘭價一再壓低，蠶農虧累之餘，對育蠶興趣大爲減退，相率刈改植，故蠶蘭産量，年有急劇縮減之勢。</p>
<p>在此各物飛躍上升之餘，各種制品較戰前所漲巨，而蠶絲獨低。農民以低價出售農産，而以高價購進日常用品，此種不平等之交換，使農民日益窮困，將其僅有之農業資本而失去，循至無從維持其生活，吾國全國人民中百分之八十爲農民，苟農民生活困苦，整修社會，何能寗靜，故欲安定民生，必先讓農民生活充裕，欲使農民生活充裕，必先發展生産，苟欲發展生産則復與蠶絲業最爲有利，因吾國土地適於植桑，氣候宜於育蠶，製絲又屬輕他工業，一經改良。發展可期，所謂有事半而可功倍者。</p>
<p>最近華中蠶絲公司因營業縮減，將一部份鷦中之絲廠機械，從事拆缷，此於吾國蠶絲業復粉前途，頗多障礙。吾人對友邦之先後發遐各種軍管工廠，俾吾國能從事經濟復興，深致感謝，同時我國歷史上享有成名之蠶絲事業，更希望友邦能以工業先進國資格，與以維護，予以提挈，使其能充分發展，爲整修大東亞努力生産。適應戰時之高度需要。華中蠶絲早經兩國當局決定予以調整，吾人希望其能即日實現，更望我國蠶絲界同人，能抛開個人私利觀念，以整修國民經濟以及大東亞全部人民之福利爲前提，在賢明當局監督指導之下，與友邦先進、取得協調，以謀蠶絲事業合理之發展。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Review and Discussion of the Study Abroad System <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Chao</p>
<p>According to a Central News Agency dispatch, Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Tani Masayuki, when meeting with reporters on June 26th, spoke about the issue of establishing a system for Chinese youth to study in Japan. From this, it can be seen that Japan's current new policies towards China not only focus on politics and economics, but also take into account culture and education. I would like to take advantage of this epoch-making opportunity to review and discuss the past and future of the study abroad system, to provide a reference for China's education circles, and also to thank the friendly country for its kindness.</p>
<p>Review of the Past Study Abroad System When China first opened up to the world, insightful individuals, assessing the situation and considering the national conditions, deeply understood the importance of science and technology. They knew that unless we caught up quickly, we would not be able to stand on our own feet and fulfill our international mission. Therefore, there was the initiative to send students abroad, with the aim of learning from others' strengths to make up for our weaknesses, adopting the best practices, and with the deepest intentions. However, at that time, transportation was not yet developed, and people regarded traveling across the ocean as a daunting and frightening prospect, and hesitated to move forward. Therefore, it was difficult to be strict in the selection process. In some cases, regardless of whether age and academic qualifications were suitable, methods of encouragement were used to gather the required number of candidates. During this initial period, the number of students returning from abroad was small, and their achievements varied. Although there were some outstanding individuals who applied their knowledge to practical use, most were merely nominally qualified. Once they obtained the title of "returned student," it was easy to enter the ranks of officials, so there were many who coveted and envied this. As a result, the trend changed drastically, with study abroad being seen as a shortcut to wealth and status. Wealthy families no longer questioned their children's intelligence and invariably considered sending them abroad as a lifelong ambition. Without waiting for government funding, they were willing to empty their own pockets, and some even sent their middle school students, aged seventeen or eighteen, abroad without waiting for their physical and intellectual maturity. Their eagerness was both pitiable and laughable. The drawbacks of studying abroad were thus rooted in this. From then on, the number of students studying abroad increased day by day. Those with limited vision valued quantity over quality, and based on statistical figures, celebrated the progress of Chinese education, not knowing that the level of returned students was deteriorating as a result. Fortunately, there were many insightful people in the country who, recognizing this crisis, strived to correct it. Therefore, the selection process for government-funded and public-funded students had to be made as strict as possible, and private-funded students were also required to apply to the Ministry of Education for study abroad certificates, with the intention of adding restrictions through review. However, due to weak implementation, the results were not significant. Cunning individuals evaded the regulations altogether, and no one was ever heard of being punished as a result. It only added another procedure, and the government undermined its own dignity. Strictly speaking, there was no so-called study abroad system in the past, but because the sending of students was excessive, the situation of studying abroad was also complicated. Those who were older and had a deeper foundation had more steadfast aspirations and studied more diligently, but they were as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns and could not be seen often. The next group were those who were muddleheaded and perfunctory, taking the degree as the goal and study abroad as a formality, and they were the most numerous. The worst were those who neglected their studies, were accustomed to extravagance, and even claimed to be unconventional, competing with each other. Close to ink, they were stained black, and the habit became a trend. All returned students could describe this in detail, so there is no need to elaborate. Although there were proposals to send senior officials to supervise on the spot, they were not effective because they were not widely implemented and the implementation was not thorough. In addition, due to excessive sending of students, the situation of applying what they learned after returning to the country was also disorganized. Government-funded and public-funded students often did not know where to start after returning to the country to contribute what they had learned, let alone private-funded students. Talented and knowledgeable individuals were rejected and ended up in poverty, while those who only stole a false reputation held important positions. The motive for sending students abroad was to save the country, but the general image of returned students presented to us was the opposite. The failure to establish a study abroad system for decades was due to this.</p>
<p>Discussion on the Study Abroad System Before discussing the study abroad system, two necessary conditions should be met: (A) The domestic education system is sound. (B) Those who implement the study abroad system have high moral character. Regarding point A, the education systems of various countries must each have their own consistent policies and characteristics. If study abroad is used as a path for further study after graduating from university, or if study abroad is used to replace domestic university education, it is not the right way to run education, and it cannot be used to establish a study abroad system. Regarding point B, the effectiveness of any system depends on the people who implement the system. When people are capable, policies are successful; when people are incapable, policies fail. This is true in all ages. If those who implement the study abroad system do not understand the importance of their own responsibilities and use their position to monopolize and seek personal gain, then even if the system is established, it will not be effective. Under these two conditions, A and B, based on my limited understanding, I propose the following outline for the study abroad system: 1. Establish a Study Abroad Management Office, which will centralize all matters related to selection, sending, supervision, assessment, recommendation, investigation, and statistics. When necessary, the office will appoint special study abroad commissioners to take responsibility for care, assistance, guidance, and supervision on the spot. 2. Whether government-funded, public-funded, or self-funded, the minimum qualification is graduation from a domestic university, good health in all three areas (intellectual, physical, and moral), and continuous service in a relevant organization for at least three years (those with special talents or contributions are not subject to this requirement). 3. When government agencies or private enterprises need special talents, they should first apply to the management office for deployment. If the office cannot supply the required personnel, then the office will publicly recruit and select a certain number of candidates who meet the minimum qualifications. This is the preliminary selection. Those who pass the preliminary selection must then engage in two preparatory tasks: (A) Become proficient in the required foreign language. (B) Research the designated research problem as much as possible in China and complete it within the specified time. The management office will select the required number of candidates from those who pass the preliminary selection based on the results of these two tasks, A and B. This is the final selection. Self-funded students must also go through the preliminary selection process and submit proof of meeting the requirements for the final selection, but they are free to choose the research problem. 4. The duration of study abroad does not need to be predetermined and should be determined based on needs. The number of candidates should not be based on the agency or discipline. The cost should also not be fixed and should be flexible, so that the efficiency of study abroad is not constrained by economic factors. As for the length of study abroad, although it is estimated in advance, there is room for increase or decrease. All arrangements will be the responsibility of the management office, and the commissioner in the host country will do their best to assist, so that there are no shortcomings. Self-funded students must have a guarantee for the funds they raise themselves and must deposit them in installments with the management office, which will distribute them on their behalf, with no difference from government-funded or public-funded students. The aim is to ensure that young people studying abroad do not have to be distracted by economic and livelihood concerns, and also do not become depraved due to excessive indulgence. All young people are the lifeblood of the country and should not be discriminated against because they are self-funded. 5. Government-funded or public-funded students will serve in the required agencies upon returning to the country. Self-funded students must first register with the management office, which will recommend them to suitable agencies as a priority. As for the detailed rules and regulations for implementation, they can be revised based on the above outline, but they are beyond the scope of this article. In addition to contributing to various sectors in China with the research problems specified by the research institute, returned students also have the mission of cultural exchange between countries, which is also worth our attention.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Night Battle of Kula Gulf: Japan Achieves Remarkable Results; 28 Enemy Ships Damaged or Destroyed in Eight Days; Over 159 Aircraft Shot Down <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) In the daylight battles off New Georgia and Kolombangara Island and the night battle of Kula Gulf on the 5th of this month, several destroyers of the Japanese naval squadron and the Japanese army and navy garrison units stationed there sank three enemy warships, severely damaged one cruiser, and heavily damaged another cruiser. This was announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 7th. The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 10th that, according to later reports, in addition to the above results, it has been confirmed that one enemy special service ship was sunk. The Class B cruiser that was damaged and caught fire has also sunk. According to later reports, on July 4th, one newly commissioned Saint Louis-class Class B cruiser, one Brooklyn-class large cruiser, and one warship of unknown type were sunk. In the night battle on that day, the Japanese naval squadron resolutely engaged in close combat with the enemy, sinking the enemy Class B cruiser Helena with torpedoes. From the course of this battle, it can be inferred that the enemy fleet was indeed frightened by the activity of the Japanese destroyer squadron and tried to escape. However, when it confirmed that the Japanese fleet was only a destroyer squadron, it regained its confidence. Therefore, the courageous operation of the destroyers at night, penetrating deep into the enemy fleet's formation, resulted in the announced victory. After this battle, the enemy fleet must have learned that the Japanese naval squadron is brave and formidable.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) From the 30th of last month, when the American forces began their counteroffensive in the areas of Rendova Island and New Georgia Island, through the naval battle of Kula Gulf on the 4th and 5th of this month, to the 7th, when enemy forces attacked Rubiana Island, over eight days, the total results achieved, according to the announcement of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, can be summarized as follows: Sunk: Four Class B cruisers, five large destroyers, one destroyer, one special service ship, one torpedo boat, one warship of unknown type, and twelve transport ships. Damaged: One Class B cruiser, one destroyer, and one torpedo boat. In total, 28 enemy warships were sunk or destroyed. In addition, many enemy boats were sunk, and over 159 enemy aircraft were shot down.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) Reuter reported from the headquarters of the Allied forces in the South Pacific that a strong formation of Japanese fighter planes fiercely attacked Rendova Island yesterday. The official report also stated that Japanese bombers attacked Allied bases in eastern New Guinea, but did not mention the losses suffered.</p>
<h3 id="e3">German Armored Forces Break Through Soviet Lines: Both Sides Employ Large Numbers of Artillery and Aircraft in Unprecedented Large-Scale Fierce Battle <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, 10th (Central News Agency) Although Soviet tank units fought to the death to block the German wedge from entering the Soviet lines south of Kursk, the breakthrough by the German reserve forces was further expanded. A DPA dispatch from Berlin last night stated that the Battle of Kursk had reached its fifth day yesterday, and its nature was unchanged compared to Thursday. Large numbers of the latest tanks, such as the German Tiger tanks and the improved Soviet T-34 tanks, were engaged in battle between Belgorod and Kursk, and in the area south of Orel. The Soviet strategy was to use tank attacks, followed by infantry attacks, in an attempt to cut off the German forces, resulting in fierce battles. However, according to reports from Berlin, the German forces achieved their objective. The Soviet forces concentrated large numbers of artillery and rocket launchers at two focal points, and the German forces also employed artillery in an unprecedented large-scale battle. Therefore, the intensity of the artillery battle between the two sides is unprecedented in this war. A Reuter correspondent commented last night that the large number of tanks, artillery, and aircraft employed by both sides in the Battle of Kursk made it the largest battle of the entire war. Both sides are constantly sending in reinforcements. Berlin reported that the number of Soviet tanks and aircraft destroyed yesterday exceeded one thousand, but it is believed that General Rokossovsky, commanding the forces in the Belgorod area, still has more tanks in reserve for his deployment. DPA pointed out that the German command has adopted new tactics for tank warfare. After the vanguard of the armored forces breaks through the echeloned Soviet lines, it does not hastily penetrate deep inside, but instead expands its breach and consolidates its positions. DPA reported that after the German armored forces broke through 60 kilometers north of Belgorod towards Kursk, they used another formation of tanks to break through the eastern Soviet defense line of Belgorod, expanding the German wedge towards Novy Oskol. The Soviet countermeasure to the German breakthrough was to attack the flanks of the German forces, but the German command had taken this possibility into account. In any case, General Rokossovsky's tank units encountered strong German armored reserves assisted by fighter and ground-attack aircraft. The German air superiority also prevented the Soviet operational plan from being realized. A Reuter correspondent in Moscow admitted last night that the dangerous area for the Soviet forces was somewhere between Belgorod and Kursk, where the German armored forces had broken through the Soviet lines. The Soviet authorities have not yet announced the exact location of the battle zone, but it is understood that the main German offensive is along the main route from Belgorod to Kursk, or parallel to that route.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Japanese Newspaper Editorial Discusses the Battle of Kursk <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) The Nagoya Chubu Nippon Shimbun editorial on the 10th, entitled "The Nature of the German-Soviet Offensive and Defensive War," commented on the future nature of the fighting in the Kursk region, stating that on the eastern front, the German and Soviet forces, at dawn on the 5th of this month, began the largest offensive and defensive war since the end of the winter campaign, centered on the Kursk salient at the northern end of the southern front. According to frontline reports, both sides had forces of one million men, and mobilized tanks and aircraft in the thousands, with a scale comparable to the large-scale offensive and defensive war in Stalingrad last fall. When this operation began, the German authorities claimed that the Soviet forces had launched the offensive first, while the Soviet Information Bureau said that the German forces had launched the offensive first. Because the two sides were completely contradictory, the truth is difficult to discern. However, it is clear that both the German and Soviet forces used the stalemate period of the past hundred days to continue to strengthen their forces in that area, waiting for an opportunity to attack. Therefore, it is not important who launched the offensive first; the main thing is who can first gain the initiative in the battle and then continue to attack. Judging from the current situation, the initiative in the battle is in the hands of the German forces. The Soviet side seems to have admitted this. Regarding armored forces and air power, the air force has an absolute advantage. In this regard, the overall situation of the battle has already been decided. There is also much discussion about whether the current operation is the German summer offensive. If we look at the map, we can see that the Soviet lines west of Kursk have a salient that extends 300 kilometers. By its nature, a salient is in a passive position, so the forces deployed there are fewer than on the defensive side. In order to remedy this defect, the German forces must flatten the salient lines in the Kursk area and make them a straight line. From the above, the current German operation seems to be a localized position-strengthening battle, with no intention of carrying out a large-scale full-scale offensive. This is clear from what the German authorities have stated several times. In short, whether the Allied forces can launch an invasion of Europe is still questionable, but their preparations are a fact. The German forces cannot repeat last summer's all-out offensive on the eastern front, concentrating their forces only on the eastern front and giving the Allied forces an opportunity to land. Therefore, an offensive like last summer's may not be possible this year, but the operation in the Kursk salient will continue to unfold. Therefore, although the German summer offensive this year is completely different in nature and scale from last summer's offensive, it is still a summer offensive.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Landing Battle Occurs on Sicily: Axis Forces Resisting Fiercely; Enemy Suffers Heavy Losses <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Rome, 10th (Central News Agency) The American High Command issued a communiqué on the 10th stating that Allied forces, under the cover of naval vessels and air forces, landed paratroopers on the 9th and began to attack Sicily. The Axis forces are resisting the enemy forces with all their might and are currently engaged in fierce battles with the enemy on the eastern coast of Sicily. When Allied aircraft attacked Sicily on the 9th, 22 aircraft were shot down by Axis ground fire, 15 of which were shot down over Gela. In addition, German fighter squadrons shot down 11 enemy aircraft. The Italian air force also severely damaged three enemy merchant ships in a torpedo attack off the coast of Tunisia.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) Reuter, citing the London Daily Mail, reported that Allied forces began landing on Sicily this morning. The landing forces included British, American, and Canadian troops, all under the command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the commander-in-chief of the Allied forces in North Africa.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) Military sources here recently stated that the Allied forces landing on the southeastern coast of Sicily suffered extremely heavy losses after the Axis defense forces fought bravely. Axis coastal batteries and bombers inflicted heavy damage on enemy landing craft and transports filled with troops.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) Plana, a special correspondent for the German News Agency, wrote that Britain and the United States have divided their tasks in the Mediterranean. Britain is responsible for attacking Europe from the eastern Mediterranean, while the United States is starting operations from the western Mediterranean. The Allied command is trying to hide its troop movements. This fact is evident from the Allied news and propaganda policy, it is said. In the past few weeks, the Allied command has been making major troop movements. Many units have been transferred from eastern Tunisia to the eastern Mediterranean. This is partly to facilitate supply and distribution, and partly to replenish its exhausted units in areas outside the range of Axis bombers, and most importantly, to reduce friction between Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>(British Eagerly Await the Invasion of Europe)</p>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) According to Reuter, a Swiss radio correspondent in London reported that as the Battle of Kursk intensifies, the emotions of the British people are also becoming tense. They are asking whether the Allied forces can invade Europe at this time. Churchill announced that he would invade Europe in the autumn, when the leaves fall, but the British clearly want this to happen immediately. The London Observer paid close attention to the Soviet report that German air forces from the Channel and the Mediterranean had been transferred to the eastern front to assist armored units, believing that the time for the Allied invasion of Europe had matured. Military sources in London believed that German forces had been transferred from Eastern Europe to the Balkans and the Mediterranean. By the time of Kursk, the strength of the German forces was so great that it was also felt. The British general public acknowledged that the time for the invasion of Europe was approaching. The magazine "Time and Tide" said that the raid on Crete and the intensified activities of the Allied air forces were a prelude to the invasion of the Italian islands.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Japanese Forces Complete Comprehensive Blockade: Chongqing's Difficult Situation Deepens <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Argentine City, 10th A special dispatch from the New York Times in Chongqing states that since Chongqing was completely blockaded by the Japanese army, its difficult situation has deepened. The Japanese army's blockade operation against Chongqing has not only weakened Chongqing's military strength, but has also paralyzed its economic power. Since the Yunnan-Burma Road was cut off, it has only been able to rely on small-scale air transport from the Soviet Union, which is difficult to meet its needs. Moreover, the Soviet Union is focusing all its efforts on the eastern front and has no time to spare, so the assistance to Chongqing is almost non-existent. Therefore, Chongqing's poverty has become imminent. Under such circumstances, it is illusory for the Chongqing army to launch a counteroffensive against Japan. As far as Chongqing's transportation situation is concerned, we all know that the number of railways still retained by Chongqing is very small, and its water transport volume is only about 100,000 tons per year. Currently, Chongqing has a total of 7,600 kilometers of railways, of which 6,000 kilometers were built after this year. The number of vehicles, including military vehicles, is less than 20,000, and most of them use alcohol or charcoal gas, so their transport capacity is extremely low. At the same time, since 1937, prices have risen a hundredfold, so the people's lives are becoming increasingly difficult, and the economic situation is becoming increasingly dire. Chongqing, in such a situation, still dreams of final victory, which is pathetic.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) The Central Reserve Bank, previously entrusted by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Food, issued the Grade B Grain Storage Bonds of the Republic of China in 1942, with a total value of 100 million yuan, to build grain storage warehouses. It has been learned that the Ministry of Food is now actively carrying out this work, adjusting existing warehouses in various places to make them scientific, and setting up warehouses in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Yangzhou, Gaoyou, Baoying, Taizhou, Lishui, Xintai, Xinghua, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Huzhou, Wuhu, Anqing, and Dangtu. The grain distribution warehouses in various rice-producing areas are all required to be completed before the autumn harvest. Regarding the management of the warehouses, once the Central Grain Storage Bureau is established, it will be managed by the bureau in order to implement the established policy of storing grain for famine prevention.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) Since its establishment, the Ministry of Food has been actively promoting grain storage. It has formulated the Rice Grain Storage Law, the Wheat Flour Prevention Law, the Rice Grain Storage Outline, and the Warehouse Destruction Law, which have been distributed to various warehouses and agricultural improvement experimental zones for reference. The various methods proposed are all practical and meet the needs.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Washington, President Roosevelt declared yesterday at an executive press conference that the United States would not recognize any French government as long as 95% of the French people are still under German rule. The President's brief remarks have attracted great attention from political circles in the area. The President did not want to make any announcement regarding his meeting with Mr. Giraud, except to say that only military issues were discussed. However, Mr. Giraud told the press yesterday about the White House meeting, saying that he had reached a complete agreement with President Roosevelt. He said that President Roosevelt had stated that he was prepared to deploy 300,000 French troops for offensive operations. According to news from well-informed sources in Washington via the Haitong News Agency, more attention is now being paid to the development of Mr. Giraud's trip. It is gradually believed that Mr. Giraud's trip will lead to a political decision. The opinion prevailing in Washington, D.C., is that President Roosevelt's statement that he would not recognize any French government was directed specifically at Petain. Those who have contacted Petain do not support the anti-Axis military goals, but focus their efforts on strengthening their political position after the war. On the contrary, others believe that it is an expression of the French spirit of fighting against Germany. Washington correspondents for American newspapers have reported for the first time that Petain's attitude has aroused suspicion in Washington.</p>

<h3 id="e24">German Commentator Analyzes Axis Production Situation, Believes that Labor Can Be Fully Supplied in This War <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) - The famous German commentator Mr. Long Lingboff recently published an article in the Berlin People's Prosecutor's Daily entitled "Nine to Eleven," in which he elaborated on the recent speeches by German Minister of Armaments Speer and Labor Organization Officer Zaker, focusing on the situation of production. The main points are as follows: German Minister of Armaments Speer previously reported to the German people on the status of German armaments production. Now, Mr. Zaker, the Labor Organization Officer who is fully responsible for the deployment of labor in Germany, has also explained the vast labor force provided to the Axis side, outlining the situation. Mr. Chai made a report on the current state of the two camps during the First World War and this war, publishing comparative figures, which is very gratifying to us. According to this, during the last World War, the manpower of Germany and its allies was only in a ratio of 10 to 1 with the United Nations. On the contrary, in this war, this situation has undergone fundamental changes. The ratio between the enemy and us is currently 9 to 11. Mr. Chai said that if we had the strength to hold on until the last five minutes at that time, we might have won the last World War. Mr. Chai has made it clear in this statement that, in terms of the current state of manpower on both sides, we now have an absolute advantage. Therefore, the outcome of this war for the Axis powers can also be answered here. At present, the total number of laborers we have is 380 million, while the enemy has 555 million. However, the labor force possessed by the Axis side is actually deployed, and is in fact the labor force that can be deployed in the future. On the contrary, although the enemy's labor force is numerically superior to ours, they may not be able to fully mobilize all of them. This is because the above numbers are the total number of laborers scattered around the world, and the enemy is restricted by climate and natural conditions, so some labor cannot be mobilized to engage in armaments production. For example, Indian farmers and black laborers on American farms. As for the labor force possessed by the Axis side, it is distributed in Europe, Japan, and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Japan today has fully demonstrated its organization, not to mention its great economic power in this war, which is beyond the dreams of the United States. Moreover, since the establishment of Manchuria, although not long ago, the domestic economy has been exceptionally developed. China, which is on the road to recovery, has also achieved great results in terms of labor distribution, with no room for doubt. At present, the 190 million labor force possessed by the two major co-prosperity spheres in the East and West can do their best, and strive to increase production in closely connected regions. The production sites on the European continent are particularly concentrated. We have now appropriately allocated the necessary labor to this concentrated production site, and the areas we control are linked together, unlike the enemy, which is scattered in various places. Therefore, we can actively implement production plans, which is far beyond the reach of the enemy. However, we not only make appropriate use of all the vast labor force, but also seek to improve its efficiency, and have achieved results. The great situation of the results obtained by the total force in the two major co-prosperity spheres in the East and West is fully evident from the results achieved by Japan, Germany, and Italy in East Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>— Tokutomi Iichiro (2)</p>
<p>By the time of Edward VII, Jewish power was even closer to the court. Edward VII was still the Prince of Wales at the age of seventy, and various kinds of mixed elements gathered around him. Among them were gamblers, speculators, financiers, and jockeys, too numerous to mention individually. Among them, Sassoon, Arnstein, and Cassel can be called his close friends. He was a Jewish financier, a famous wealthy man in England. It was said that some of the secret expenses of the Crown Prince were paid by him. Therefore, after Edward VII ascended the throne, he naturally remained a powerful figure by his side. During the Russo-Japanese War, Japan raised public bonds. He and Jewish financiers in New York, such as Schiff and Loeb, responded to each other, subscribing to public bonds and contributing a lot. This was naturally at the suggestion of Edward VII, and we need not speculate wildly.</p>
<p>Looking at Jewish power outside the court, there is no doubt that some of the party expenses of the two major political parties in England, the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party, are paid by Jews. Although cleverly concealed, the Marconi wireless telegraph incident was a major event that once shook British politics. The British Liberal Party cabinet almost collapsed as a result. Now there is no need to describe the beginning and end in detail here. To put it simply, on March 7, 1912, Samuel, the then Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, paid the Marconi Company for wireless telegraph affairs. Samuel was naturally a Jewish politician. Even in Japan, there was a branch of his compatriot Samuel Petroleum Company.</p>
<p>Moreover, the general manager of the Marconi Company, Godfrey Isaacs, was also a British Jew. His brother, Rufus Isaacs, was then the Attorney General of the Liberal Party Asquith cabinet and the chief legal advisor to the cabinet. Godfrey Isaacs, the general manager who was instructed by the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, went to the United States with 100,000 shares of the American Marconi Company and returned to the London market. Prior to this, he had secretly met with his brother Harry and the then Attorney General Rufus to consult his two brothers and propose to distribute them at a price of one pound and sixteen shillings per share. Harry took 56,000 shares here, and Rufus then bought 10,000 shares from Harry at a price of two pounds per share. However, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer Lloyd George provided the funds to the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs Samuel, and Lloyd George and the Parliamentary Secretary of the Treasury kept it as a secret expense for Liberal studies. Airey-Punt also participated in this matter at that time.</p>
<p>In April 1912, these stocks were offered to the market at a price of three pounds and five shillings. As a result, General Manager Godfrey, Harry, the Isaacs brothers, and Lloyd George, Airey-Punt, etc., all sold those stocks and gained considerable profits. Airey-Punt not only used his own property, but also used the secret expenses of the Liberal Party, and gained even more benefits. Therefore, in July 1912, the approval case for the contract between Minister of Posts and Telegraphs Samuel and Marconi Company General Manager Godfrey Isaacs was submitted to the House of Commons, and the problem arose here. The subsequent disturbances are not described in detail. Lloyd George was unaware of it at first, so there was nothing he could do. After the investigation committee was selected, Attorney General Rufus Isaacs secretly met with the committee and made it clear that not only himself, but also North Pavilion officials were involved in the matter. Saying that if Lloyd George pointed out this matter, it would be a loss. He even made his wife's savings account public in court. When England engaged in the South African Boer War, the Chamberlain family was a major shareholder in an arms company and obtained undue profits, and Lloyd George had also proposed a motion for impeachment in the House of Commons. The so-called yesterday is right and today is wrong is probably referring to this kind of thing! Soon it ended anticlimactically and vanished like smoke. This is naturally the success of the British government in turning big things into small things and small things into nothing.</p>
<p>Rufus Isaacs was the youngest of the three brothers in his family. He initially lingered in the stock market as a broker and the like. He once caused an event related to criminal issues, but it was unexpectedly eliminated. Therefore, he aspired to become a jurist, a lawyer, entered Parliament, and gradually succeeded. He smoothly became the Governor-General of India and was conferred the title of Marquess of Reading, which was a higher rank than Disraeli's earldom. He eventually became the Master of the Rolls in the English High Court. He had completely fulfilled everything a party member should have, and he occupied a transcendent official position outside the party, maintaining it until after his release. He reached this point, and his talent need not be said, but even more than this, we must not forget that it is his Jewish instinct.

<p>List of Economic Mission Members: Under the leadership of Ogura Masatsune, the head of the Japanese Economic Mission, members entered the venue in succession around 5:00 PM amidst applause.

Head Ogura wore formal attire with a red flower on his lapel, appearing to be in good spirits. After all members were seated, Highest Advisor Ishiwata and Consul General Nakata also arrived at the venue, and everyone stood up to welcome them.</p>
<p>Welcome Speech by Wen Lantao: Chairman Wen Lantao, President of the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association, after announcing the opening of the meeting, delivered a welcome speech, stating: "Distinguished members of the economic mission, esteemed gentlemen: Today, I, on behalf of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association, extend a warm welcome to the 'Sino-Japanese Goodwill Private Economic Mission' led by His Excellency Ogura. I feel exceptionally gratified and hold unlimited hopes. From any perspective, mutual assistance and cooperation between China and Japan are a matter of course, and there is no need to repeatedly emphasize this point. Recent measures between the two governments have been moving in this direction. Various sectors of the two countries should uphold the will of the government authorities, strengthen mutual assistance and cooperation, cherish each other's country, love their neighbors, and build a Greater East Asia of co-existence and co-prosperity. The gentlemen of the economic mission are all elites from friendly private sectors and leaders in the economic community. This visit to China to inspect the economy will surely yield satisfactory results beyond expectations. 'Where sincerity resides, even metal and stone will yield.' The two great nations of China and Japan, placing their hearts on the table and treating each other with sincerity, sharing a determination to share weal and woe, will surely achieve the goal of co-existence and co-prosperity. Finally, I wish the gentlemen of the economic mission good health and success in completing their mission."</p>
<p>Speech by Mr. Chen Shao: According to a speech by Mr. Chen Shao, representing the China Central China Headquarters of the East Asia Economic Roundtable, expressed a sincere welcome to the economic mission and hoped that the mission would carry out its great mandate to complete the war between China and Japan and achieve the goal of building the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>Response by Mission Head Ogura: Economic mission head Ogura responded that the mission's visit to China was due to the enthusiastic execution of the Liaison Association and the China Central China Headquarters of the East Asia Economic Roundtable, for which he was deeply grateful. He also expressed contentment at being able to gather with economic authorities and frankly exchange opinions. He deeply thanked Mr. Wen Lantao and Mr. Chen Shao for their welcome speeches. Since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, China and Japan have stood on the same front to jointly seek the construction of a new order in East Asia. However, to thoroughly construct a new order in East Asia, it is first necessary to complete the war, and to complete the war, it is even more necessary to first establish a wartime economic system in order to achieve the goal. Therefore, China and Japan must cooperate closely in the economy and work together to complete this great mandate. The main purpose of the mission's visit to China was to frankly exchange opinions with people in the Chinese economic community and to discuss and find concrete solutions for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. Since arriving in China, the mission has contacted and held several meetings with economic figures from your group, learning that there are many economic problems in Shanghai that urgently need to be resolved. Therefore, he will do his best to help solve these problems and will consult Mr. Ishiwata. Regarding the realization of economic cooperation between China and Japan, as Mr. Wen said, "Where sincerity resides, even metal and stone will yield." If we can make the greatest determination, any difficult problem can be solved easily. Furthermore, there is the Chinese story of Li Guang shooting the stone, which proves that with determination, even stubborn stones can be opened, which can serve as a mirror for us. Finally, he welcomed Chinese economic figures to organize observation missions to Japan to thoroughly understand and cooperate with each other.</p>
<p>Speeches by Chinese and Japanese Members: Vice President of the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association, Takeo Komuro, was ill, so Executive Director Mr. Fujino, on behalf of the Japanese members, delivered a speech, stating that the presence of the Japanese economic mission at today's friendship meeting and the unity of spirit among the Chinese and Japanese economic figures present were highly commendable. The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association is an assembly for mutual cooperation between Chinese and Japanese economic figures. The members were grateful for the visit of Head Ogura and his delegation. China and Japan are geographically close countries. If they can cooperate sincerely, they will surely be able to promote East Asia. Therefore, in addition to implementing friendship today, they have a heavy responsibility. We must make further progress in understanding and work hard to achieve the final goal.</p>
<p>Speech by Zhang Yipeng: Then, Mr. Zhang Yipeng, representing the Chinese members, delivered a speech stating that today, welcoming the Japanese mission and hearing Head Ogura's frank and trending statements made us very excited. From an economic perspective, the natural conditions, geographical advantages, and material resources of China and Japan can provide the most suitable natural conditions for cooperation. Economic cooperation must have two essential elements: First, sincerity. If one party is reluctant, the surface may resemble cooperation, but the content will inevitably conflict. Once there is mutual benefit, if one party wants to take more advantage, the other party will inevitably be disappointed, and cooperation will not be effective. Looking at past facts, after the Japanese came to China, there were many factories in Shanghai and nearby major cities. At that time, many hoped that the Japanese would come to cooperate, but the method of cooperation stipulated that Chinese people would account for 49% of the total amount, while Japanese people would account for 51%. Moreover, the Japanese issued bills for custody fees and repair fees, without making a single exception. They could get 51%, which is a major obstacle to economic cooperation. When the project was about to succeed, the first need of the Chinese factory was Japanese technical talent, while supervisory management talent was secondary. As a result, those sent to the factory were mostly in the supervisory management area, and those in the technical field were few, so they felt very anxious, which is another economic obstacle. This time, everyone has spent a lot of effort and time, so of course they want to get a satisfactory solution. Learning from the mistakes of the past, I dare not avoid taboos and frankly tell you this for your reference.</p>
<p>Speech by Chen Riping: Soon, Mr. Chen Riping, a member of both the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association and the East Asia Economic Roundtable, also stood up to speak, deeply hoping that the economic mission could improve and coordinate the economy of China and Japan, and strive to eliminate obstacles in China in order to obtain satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Speech by Advisor Ishiwata: Stating: "Wartime economic policies, whether in the Chinese or Japanese governments, cannot achieve good results without the cooperation of the private economic sector. Today, gathering the leaders of the Chinese and Japanese private economic sectors in one place can often have good gains. For the government, the most serious problem in China today is the 'price problem,' especially the price problem in Shanghai. I previously inspected various places with Minister Zhou, and the situation in Hankou was better than that in Shanghai. Although rising prices are inevitable in any wartime country, the price situation in China is even more serious. Because of the soaring prices, merchants think they have gained considerable benefits, but they must know that other prices are also rising, and as a result, they cannot obtain any benefits. Ignoring the overall situation for the sake of temporary personal gain is extremely foolish. However, the most important thing to solve this 'price problem' is the cooperation of the private sector. For example, the Japanese private sector price cooperation conference has already cooperated with the government and achieved good results in suppressing prices. Asian countries also have similar private sector cooperatives. The Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association is the most powerful organization in the Shanghai industrial and commercial community. If it can cooperate with the government to solve the serious 'price problem,' I believe it will make a great contribution and will also greatly benefit the livelihoods of the people of China and Japan. In the future, the opinions provided by the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association to the government will surely be adopted by the government authorities."</p>
<p>The Entire Mission Will Go to Beijing for Discussions: The Japanese economic mission is scheduled to go to Beijing on the 12th to meet with Chairman Wang, Commander-in-Chief, and Ambassador Tani. After that, they will hold economic discussions with the ministers of Industry, Finance, and Food, members of the National Economic Commission, and key figures from various groups. They will also discuss cultural issues with the ministers of Foreign Affairs and Education, exchange opinions with Advisor Ishiwata, and visit Yuhuatai and Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum.</p>
<p>Akashi Discusses the New Economy: After the Japanese economic mission came to China, various parties held frequent banquets and sincerely discussed strategies for solving economic problems. All parties have high expectations for the results and content of the talks. According to Mr. Akio Akashi, a member of the mission and chairman of the Tokyo Bank Collection Association, the essence of the new economic policy lies in protecting and supporting Chinese national capital and actively cooperating with it. It is not enough to simply protect and support Chinese national capital. In the future, in order to nurture Chinese national capital, Japanese capital must be provided to new economic fields that allow the Chinese side to operate. Therefore, those of us who are responsible for the financial sector are willing to frankly discuss this point with Chinese financial giants and prepare to eliminate obstacles to the growth of national capital. Once financial cooperation is successful, problems in other economic sectors can also be solved.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association and the China Central China Headquarters of the East Asia Economic Roundtable jointly held a tea party to entertain the Japanese Economic Mission. Mr. Shotaro Ishiwata, the highest economic advisor to the National Government, attended the meeting and gave a speech. We express our agreement with Mr. Ishiwata's insightful views.</p>
<p>The main points of Advisor Ishiwata's speech: Wartime economics will not achieve the desired results without the full cooperation of the private economic sector. The most serious economic problem in China is the price problem, especially the price problem in Shanghai. The situation in Hankou is better than that in Shanghai. Rising prices are inevitable in wartime countries, but the price situation in China is even more serious. Japan and Manchuria both have private organizations that cooperate with the government to suppress prices and have achieved results. The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association is the most powerful private economic organization and should actively assume this responsibility.</p>
<p>Regarding these three points, they are also our consistent views. The first point is not only true for the economic aspect, but also for the political aspect. It cannot be strengthened without the cooperation of the people. We have repeatedly emphasized the relationship between the Shanghai price problem. We fully agree with the views of Advisor Ishiwata and do not hope that the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association only "befriends" and holds receptions and welcomes, considering that it has fulfilled its mission. We hope that the association will assume the responsibility of cooperating to suppress prices and give full play to the active performance of private organizations. We look forward to it.</p>

<p>The inaugural Rain Qi Cup basketball league, sponsored by the Huizhong Bank, kicked off yesterday afternoon at 5 o'clock at the Paramount ballroom, with a crowded audience. Mr. Pan Sansheng presided over the opening ceremony. First, Zhou Bangjun and Huang Yuqi delivered opening speeches, and finally, the general manager Chen Zhong reported on the preparations. An autographed basketball was auctioned, and Chen Chunhua purchased it at a high price of 10,000 yuan, designated for the Shaoxing Middle School Scholarship Fund. The women's performance started first. The referee was Yu Juju. The Upper Girls' team was unable to field their main player, Zhang Zhen, due to illness, and Huang Mingyuan also mistakenly missed the time, resulting in the team lacking a leader. In addition, Shi Mei of the White Goose team had remarkably accurate shots, scoring almost every time. As a result, the White Goose team greatly defeated the Upper Girls' team by 31 to 9. The first half ended with the White Goose team leading 20 to 4. As the final match began, Lu Guyuan of the Mixed team made a long shot, opening the scoring. The Northern team refused to be outdone, and Shen Jingong scored, bringing the score back to a tie. The Mixed team then went on a scoring spree, but the Northern team called a timeout to reduce their momentum. Li Zhenzhong made a jump shot, and Li Baozhong scored from long range, resulting in three ties. The first half ended with the Northern team leading 21 to 18. In the second half, the Northern team's offense was strong, and the excellent shots of Li Baozhong and Shen Yu Gong seemed divinely inspired, pushing the score upwards. The Mixed team's advantage was not good, and they bravely resisted, with close defense, resulting in a fierce, yet somewhat relaxed, situation. In the end, the Northern team overcame the Mixed team by 51 to 41.</p>

<h3 id="e43">"Appropriate Authority" <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Inagaki Noboru, Director of the Materials Control Office of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, told reporters the other day: "This port lacks an appropriate authority to deal with unscrupulous merchants who seek illegal profits." It was also pointed out that "In order to relieve the general public in this port, the suppression of hoarding and profiteering, and the penalty tax rules, need to be reorganized."</p>
<p>From the preceding statement, we can imagine that although the material organization work in Shanghai has been carried out for some time, and although it has the support of the Public Works Department and the local authorities, it still feels unable to cope with the rampant hoarding and soaring prices. From the latter statement, we can feel that the crackdown on hoarding is not only lacking in unified and effective executive authority, but also the penalty rules are not strict enough.</p>
<p>While deeply sympathizing with Mr. Inagaki Noboru's views, we hope that after the recovery of the Public Concession and the French Concession, due to the unified police authority, and the manifestation of strength, an appropriate authority can be organized to effectively enforce the crackdown on hoarding, and to strictly reorganize the rules for punishing hoarding. The defect of "having laws but no one to enforce them" must be remedied, and the principle of "using severe punishments to govern a chaotic country" must be implemented.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Following Ministerial Standards: Financial Institutions Increase Capital According to Regulations; Native Banks Transformed into Limited Companies <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>In order to comply with the financial authorities' determination to strengthen wartime economic institutions, financial institutions in this city are required to increase capital or merge within a six-month deadline after July 1 this year. It is stipulated that banks organized as limited companies or joint-stock limited companies, including native banks, silver shops, silver companies, and trust companies, must have a total capital of at least 6 million yuan. According to the Company Law, half of the capital, or 3 million yuan, must be paid up first before business can commence. In the past, the stipulated capital amount was 500,000 yuan, so financial institutions have been increasing capital in accordance with the new regulations. According to a survey by a Shanghai News reporter, in the past week, more native banks have increased capital than regular banks, because small banks mostly increased capital successively in May and June. Native banks were slower, and since July 1, after the Ministry of Finance ordered them to be reorganized as limited companies, several have increased their capital to 3 million yuan or more. Many others are in the process of convening shareholders' meetings to discuss capital increases. New banks or native banks are also being established, and their capital must be at least half of the minimum amount before they are allowed to operate. Regarding mergers, although they are possible in principle, the unique circumstances of each financial institution make them difficult to implement, so capital increase will be the only way forward. The revised minimum capital amount for financial institutions is 6 million yuan for limited companies or joint-stock limited companies, 2 million yuan for unlimited companies, and 5 million yuan for general commercial banks engaged in trust business (including 3 million yuan for the bank's capital and 2 million yuan for the trust department's capital).</p>

<h3 id="e50">Reviving the Silk Industry and Stabilizing People's Livelihood <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Da</p>
<p>China has always been based on agriculture, and among agricultural products, silk and ramie are the most important, and are major exports. Due to the lack of statistical data in our country, there are no accurate figures for the annual production of silk. According to the Customs report in 1929, the export of raw silk was more than 189,000 dan, which, at the current value of 60,000 yuan per dan, is worth more than 100 million yuan in national currency. This does not include the domestic consumption of silk factories and local silk products. If these are included in the calculation, the amount will be even larger.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, many factories have been severely damaged, and silk factories have certainly not been spared. The remaining factories in the three regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai have been exclusively operated by the Allied Sino-Japanese Silk Company since 1938. This includes 14 factories in Jiangsu Province (Wuxi 12, Suzhou 2), 7 factories in Zhejiang Province (Hangzhou 2, Chang'an 2, Jiaxing 2, Xiashi 1), and 2 factories in Shanghai, totaling 23 factories with 7,476 silk looms. The monthly production of raw silk is about 3,000 dan. Since 1941, the business situation has gradually declined. Currently, only 6 factories are still operating in the three regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, with just over 2,000 silk looms.</p>
<p>During the same period, 28 new silk factories emerged in the Shanghai Concession. Due to the difficulty in collecting raw materials, they disappeared like a flash in the pan and soon closed down. There are more than 300 small silk-making factories scattered throughout the interior, with Wuxi having the most. However, they are short of capital, have simple equipment, and are set up and dismantled quickly, changing with the times. They are merely a kind of abnormal handicraft enterprise adapting to the extraordinary environment, earning a small profit and barely surviving.</p>
<p>Silk is the national quintessence of China and the only sideline occupation of Chinese farmers for thousands of years. However, it has declined to the point where it is now, and the impact on the national economy and people's livelihood is enormous. According to reports, the harvest of spring cocoons this year in Jiangsu Province is about 50,000 dan, and there is no such figure for Zhejiang Province. However, Zhejiang Province has historically produced more cocoons than Jiangsu Province, so the reduction in cocoon production in Zhejiang Province in recent years is even greater than in Jiangsu Province. The reason for the reduction in cocoon production this spring is due to the lack of silkworm eggs. It is a pity that good mulberry leaves are left to rot on the ground. However, due to the unstable silk prices and the repeated price reductions of cocoons over the years, farmers have lost interest in silkworm breeding after suffering losses, and have switched to other crops, resulting in a sharp decline in cocoon production year after year.</p>
<p>In addition to the soaring prices of various commodities, various products have risen greatly compared with before the war, but silk alone is low. Farmers sell agricultural products at low prices and buy daily necessities at high prices. This unequal exchange makes farmers increasingly impoverished and loses their only agricultural capital, eventually making it impossible to maintain their lives. Eighty percent of the people in China are farmers. If farmers live in poverty, how can the entire society be peaceful? Therefore, to stabilize people's livelihood, we must first make farmers prosperous. To make farmers prosperous, we must first develop production. If we want to develop production, then the revival of the silk industry is the most beneficial, because China's land is suitable for planting mulberry trees, the climate is suitable for raising silkworms, and silk making is a light industry. Once improved, development can be expected, which means that with half the effort, twice the result can be achieved.</p>
<p>Recently, the Sino-Japanese Silk Company has reduced its operations and dismantled some of the silk factory machinery, which poses many obstacles to the revival and development of the silk industry in our country. We deeply appreciate the Allied countries' prior delivery of various military-managed factories, so that our country can engage in economic revival. At the same time, we hope that the Allied countries, as an industrially advanced country, will maintain and support the silk industry, which has enjoyed fame in Chinese history, so that it can be fully developed to strive for production in East Asia and meet the high needs of wartime. The Sino-Japanese Silk Company has already been decided by the authorities of the two countries to be adjusted. We hope that this can be realized as soon as possible. We also hope that people in the silk industry in our country can abandon their individual self-interest and take the welfare of the national economy and all the people of East Asia as the premise, and coordinate with the advanced forces of the Allied countries under the supervision and guidance of the wise authorities to seek the rational development of the silk industry.</p>
