<p>社評</p>
<h3>提高戰時農業生產</h3>
<p>豐富的農產，是支持戰爭的物質條件之一。我們如果要求能支持目前長期的第二次世界大戰而爭取大東亞戰爭的最後勝利，除了政治上的團結與修明以外，就不能忽視經濟上的條件，尤其是豐富之農產的補充。</p>
<p>中國是東亞最大的農業國家，農業經濟是中國主要的國民經濟形態。但是，說到農產，我們却並不能「高枕無憂」，相反的，中國農村的動態，還值得有最大的心力去注意他。由於歷史上悠久的封建關係的壓榨，由於近百年來英美的侵略，中國的農村經濟，已經疲敝不堪了。長期的貧困侵襲，農民已經喪失其改良生產的力量了。大家都是在掙扎着，都是在靠天吃飯。這幾年來，由於重慶的拖戰，「農輟於野」已是最普遍的現象。在和平區內，經過二年多之時日，似乎依然可以耕種了，但是，因爲糧食和其他農作物的漲價的影響，使農村的分化益加劇烈，而談不到提高農民的一般的生產力。江甫本是產米之區，而糧食問題的嚴重，竟仍出人意外地劇烈，雖然最重要的原因不在生產，但生產不足顯然也是一大原因。現在國民政府宣布參戰了，由於中日兩國戰時的需要，於是，提高農業生產，應爲目前重要的任務。</p>
<p>爲了提高農業生產，目前就應該擴大農作物，而爲了保證農產之經常收穫，還應該發動難民進行荒地的開墾工作。同時，努力於水利和植林的工作，努力於誘導農民從事於種籽與土壤的改良。不過，社曾經濟的關係如果不加改善，則一切科學技術就無法採用到實際生產中去的。因爲墾荒不是農民個人赤手空拳所能幹得了的，水利與植林不是農民少數人所能爲力的，改良種籽與土壤，也不是一貧如洗的農民所能進行的。</p>
<p>所以，爲了眞正提高農業生產，必須在經濟上給廣大農業以援助。第一件是推廣農業貸款。不過，這裏應該避免重慶政權舉辦農貸的失敗的原因。重慶在這幾年來，盛行農貸，但實際上需要資金的眞正的農民是貸不到款，有些貸到款的農民，不是把資金用於生產，而用於納租納稅還債還息。而另一方面，却有利用特殊地位借得大批資金的土豪劣紳，用來放高利貸去了。重慶政權下各省的農村中，百分之八十的信用合作社，共實際的作用，還不是變相的高利貸機關嗎？這樣，不是提高農產，而是盤剝農民，破壞農村經濟，那裏談得到農業增產？今天和平區內要行農貸，必須建立合理的信用合作，寬鬆担保的條件，使農民能借到資金，必須减低過去的利息，使農民的負担减輕。</p>
<p>不過，單單實行農貸，解決了農業生產的資金問題，這是不夠的，因爲積年的負担，這是重重地壓在農民甚上，決不能安心努力於農產的增進。所以，其次，這必須减輕農民的各種不合理的不公平的負担。首先是對於個農，實行减租；同時，對於佃農及小地主，實行減少或免除不合理的捐稅，以舒展中小農民的力量。否則，一方面實行農貸款，一方面仍舊保留農民身上的苛稅，甚至還因戰爭的理由，而增加新式的應時的捐稅，則實際上不是增裕國家收入，却是阻止農業增產，違反了參戰的意思的。</p>
<p>近年來上海及共他大城市的游資，有一部份流入各地農村，有人說這是發展農村的好氣象，這是知其一不知其二的說法。本來，游資投入農村生產，是應該鼓勵的，不過，實際上一查游資流入鄉村的情形，便有大謬不然者。因爲主要的表現，不是農村生產獲得資金的興奮，而相反的是田地的所有權的轉移，尤其是表現了土地所有權的集中化，自耕農和小地主的數目劇烈的减少，而少數游資的擁有者却成爲廣大農村的新的主人翁，新的大地主。地主史動了，佃農就跟着轉動，如果要不喪失耕地，那就要忍受增租的痛苦。針對這種現象，就應該設法保障佃農的佃租權，禁止不合理的加租，以使農民能安心生產，同時禁止大量土地的荒蕪，不事生產，使游資流入鄉村者不是進行土地投機，而是眞正扶助生產。</p>
<p>此外，還應該合理改善佃農與中小農民對於田賦及戰時捐稅的負担。禁止大地主轉嫁其負担於佃農，自耕農及小地主。這種弊端淸除之後，再努力於推廣農村於運銷合作事業，以避免商業資本的剝削。</p>
<p>爲了參戰的實際需要，必須切實施行上述辦法以提高農業生產。這不祇是技術上的問題，而是要從土地政策，糧食政策，財政政策等多方面的改善努力；否則，一切好聽的口號與好看的政策，決不會發生實際的效力。</p>

<h3>日情報局發言人　招待外籍記者　分析英美對渝態度</h3>
<p>東京十三日同盟社電　情報局發言人堀氏今日招待外籍新聞記者時聲稱、美英兩國因日本迅速決定撤廢其在華治外法權與租界、頗爲惶慮、乃於一月十一日對渝締結協定、允放棄其根據一九〇一年拳亂議定書而享有之特權、（駐兵華北、治外法權、暨有關通商口岸、內地續航、與沿海貿易之特權等）、又允交還北京使館區、上海與鼓浪嶼之公告租界及英租界之行政權、此舉就表面觀之、似已將大量之權利歸還重慶、然捨冗言而外實空無一物、緣交還租界行政權、僅施於五區、即上海與鼓浪嶼之公共租界、北京使館區、天津與廣州之英租界顧此等區域、現已被日軍佔據、英人已不能談此等區域之保留或交還事矣、關於英美允棄其關於通商口岸、內地航行與沿海貿易之特權、亦不過一種空洞之姿勢、若在戰前、英美仍有貿易關係、並能派船航行於沿海與長江時、出此舉動、則尚有若干意義、然在今日、英美勢力已被完全逐出東亞、其貿易與內地航行亦不復存在、則此舉已毫無意義、茲英美華北駐兵已盡成俘虜、故放棄其華北駐兵權、徒使整個協定、添一「笑料」而已、</p>
<h3>杭新運分會　正式成立</h3>
<p>杭州十三日中央社電　新運促進委會杭市分會、現已籌備完竣、今（十三日）正式成立、所有人選亦均發表、即將展開杭市新運推進工作、</p>
<h3>傅秉常被任　渝駐蘇使</h3>

<h3>華盛頓通訉　關於美國的選舉　民主黨勉強保持優勢　共和黨則已大見抬頭　一月十日澳門轉來</h3>
<p>美國議會與州長的選舉，結果已於十一月四日揭曉，民主黨仍保持控制的優勢，共和黨經一九四〇年總選頓挫以後，在本屆選舉中，形勢大見抬頭，這一點頗堪注意。這次美國選舉的舉行，競選運動，雖不能引起熱烈的興趣，但是美國四年一度的大選，在兩年以後，即將舉行，屆時世界大戰，能否結束，尚難預言，而羅斯福於三任以後，勢必退避，又在人人的意中。所以這次的選舉，在平淡進行之中，仍涵孕着相當的未來意義。</p>
<p>按照美國政治的制度，參議員的任期爲六年，每兩年改選三分之一，衆院的任期爲兩年，期滿全體改選，州長的任期，則因各州的法制不同，有兩年和四年的兩種規定，其選舉與議會同時舉行。在目前的選舉當中，應選出州長三十二人，參議員三十五人，與衆議員四百三十二人，緬因州則因成例，已於九月間選出共和黨州長一人，參議員一人與衆議員三人，據現時所接到的未證實的選舉結果，共和黨在參院占三八席，民主黨占五八席，共和黨在衆院獲二〇八席，民主黨則獲二二〇席。州長的選舉，尚無報道。試看前兩屆選舉之結果！</p>
<p>一九三八年選舉（第七六屆議會）</p>
<p>參院　衆院</p>
<p>民主黨　六九　二六二</p>
<p>共和黨　二三　一七〇</p>
<p>其他　四　三</p>
<p>一九四〇年選舉（第七七屆會議）</p>
<p>民主黨　六五　二五八</p>
<p>共和黨　二九　一六五</p>
<p>其他　二　一二</p>
<p>我們即不能明瞭這次共和黨選舉結果的抬頭，是一種顯著的現象，倘使在平時發生，野黨對於政府的措施，可以隨時掣肘，必將產生不利的影響，這種現象，在胡佛總統任內的後期，非常顯著。</p>
<p>倘使這次的世界大戰，在一九四四年十一月美國下屆大選前結束，就目前選舉的結果來推測，將發生什麽可能的影響？按照美國政黨史的往例，民主黨的執政，多在盤根錯節的時期，在威爾遜和羅斯福的肩頭，先後分担了兩次大戰的重責，而共和黨的執政，多在安享和平的時期，這種事例，也許是出於巧合，不足懸爲定則，但觀察美國人民好動的民族性，這次大戰的善後責任，落在共和黨的肩上，并是不沒有可能。現前美國兩大政黨的政綱，並無顯明的分別，他們的對外政權的遞嬗，並沒有予以重大關切的理由，我們所感到興趣的，毋寗是執政者的人選問題。</p>

<p>中國已經到了三十二年，婦女解放運動的提出，也不會少於這年數的，第一個參加本身解放運動的婦女，也許已經是老太太，而老太太的命運　不比她的母親强了多少，依然是一在家靠父母，出門靠丈夫。」</p>
<p>解放運動的沒有成就，有人以爲是男子的壓力太大：不錯，沒有一個丈夫不不望他的太太能够做一個賢明的主婦，安心於家政，寗可有一個溫暖的家庭，不必要一個會賺錢的太太，從這種心理所生的行爲當然不利於婦女解放運動的第一步—尋求職業，爭取經濟地位的平等。更由種心理把社會　境形成反動　輿　開始懷疑，和男孩子受過同樣學校敎育的，　姐們是不是好妻子？自命爲敎育家的認爲女子還是應該受特殊敎育家事是不可或缺的必修功課，更有人大聲疾呼敎婦女趕快同到家庭裏去，根本不要再去求甚麼經濟地位平等。表面上看，這些全是男子在壓迫婦女，但是仔細想一想，這些是不是　單地因爲男子的蠻橫無理。</p>
<p>也有人以爲婦女運動沒有結果應該歸之於婦女自己不爭氣，嫁了丈夫，便像有了靠山似的關在家裏再不想甚麼平等解放了。而事實上，眞是寃枉了不少智　婦女、除了沒有智識，不曾受過敎育的婦女也許自甘墮落，不求上進以外，有智識的婦女沒有不希望自己能够和丈夫，和所有的男子一樣從事於社會工作的。祇是家庭的瑣務不允許她們離開家門一步。許多少奶奶在咕嚕了：一敎我們能在搖籃　做　分嗎？能在灶頭上實騐分晰化學嗎？先補補阿囡的長衫呢，還是先看看莎士比亞的名著」？在家庭裏自修尚且如此多阻，能說她們自　不願意走向十字街頭去嗎？</p>
<p>這些觀察，全犯了膚淺的毛病，倘使再追究下去，男子爲甚麼要把婦女關在家庭裏？婦女爲甚麼自願放棄爭取平等？就可以找出一個很明顯的相同點，就是因爲有家庭存；爲了瑣屑的家事使男子强迫，或是女子自願的留在家庭裏的。而，使家事變得這樣繁複的，是那些孩子們　有孩子的家庭是少不了一個隨時注意　的主婦，沒有孩子在家裏，一　就簡單了。</p>
<p>所以，婦女要　取解　，先要謀經濟地位平等，要謀經濟地位平等，先要安置小寶寶解決安置小寶寶的問題，而且托兒所是專責和專門的保育機關，在孩子方面也可以减少許多的小幸事件，可是，小規模的，貴族化的，私有的托兒所，限於人力物力的經　條件決不能够普遍設立。這是需要賢明的政治家能够明瞭保育制度的重要，用政府的力量爲人民設置普遍的的托兒所！</p>
<p>請不必爲你個人的成功欣幸，找着了職業的太太們！你們走錯了路，與　說是成功，母寗說是失敗；雖不能斷定諸位每人家事全用着娘姨，丫頭，大姐，然而必定是有的多，這樣，祇不過是奴使別人來幸福自己，能不使人對解放運動寒心嗎？</p>

<h3>加強共榮圈運輸力　爪哇建造大型木船</h3>
<p>擔負南方共榮圈內物資交換的重要職務之日本第一木造船，新近成爲新春的禮物而登場，於運輸陣營中加入了新的威力。</p>
<p>日本軍政當局爲在造船當地樹立自給政策起見，注目於全島無盡藏的森林資源，早已進行着大型木造船的建造計畫。近頃其　一艘的船體已告完成，在〇〇造船廠，於岡崎軍政監及以下有關官員等蒞塲之下，舉行了盛大的準水典禮。爪哇的建造木造船，向來只建造二三十噸，至多也不過一百噸的沿岸用之小型船而已。像此次所造那樣的大型船，實爲爪哇破天荒的第一次，殊堪注目。</p>
<p>船體全部用耐水性極强的麻栗樹造成，具有堅靸的耐久力和凌波性，其性能的優美。比諸普通汽船亦無遜色，誠爲世界無匹的絕對優秀的木造船。</p>
<p>該船於去年十月二十日裝就龍骨後，僅經七十日之短時日而告進水，此實爲建造之時，由早藤廠長指揮下之日本指導團不屈不撓的努力，和覺悟共榮大道理的馬來船匠不眠不休的協力結果。那樣的造船速力，比諸設備完善的日本內地造船廠，亦可說是破紀錄的。該船最近正在船體的裝潢中，預定於二月上旬將作莊嚴的處女航。今後將陸續建造第二船，第三船，作爲南方的交易船，航行於南方各島與大陸之間，成爲繫結大東亞弁榮圈島國之大動脈，固不待言。更將遠越海洋，載運南方的士產而來日本內地，故其將來的活躍，大可期待。</p>

<h3>想起了蘇秦</h3>
<p>— 賈新生</p>
<p>戰國策和史記裏，對於蘇秦，都有紀載。文字雖間有出入，內容郤是相仿。</p>
<p>當蘇秦說秦王書十上而說不行，落魄歸來的時候，戰國策這樣描寫：</p>
<p>「……羸　履　，負書担囊，形容枯槁，面目黎黑，狀有愧色。歸至家，妻不下帷，嫂不爲炊，父母不與言。蘇秦喟然歎曰：『妻不以我爲夫，嫂不以我爲叔，父母不以我爲子，是皆秦之罪也！』」</p>
<p>後來，蘇秦發憤讀書，說趙王威功，受相印，大大得意。戰國策又這樣描寫：</p>
<p>「……將說楚王，路過洛陽，父母聞之，淸宮除道，張樂設飲，郊迎三十里。妻側目而視，傾耳而聽。嫂蛇行匍伏，四拜•自跪而謝。蘇秦曰：「嫂何前倨而後恭也？」嫂曰：「以季子之位尊而多金。」蘇秦曰：『嗟乎！貧家則父母不子，富貴則親戚畏懼。人生世上，勢位富厚，蓋可忽乎哉？』」</p>
<p>蘇秦之爲人，展史早有定論，毋庸我們翻案。我們覺得這兩段文字，對比得太妙了：司馬遷看見戰國策裏有這樣妙文，當然不肯輕輕放過，藉此大發牢騷，澆胸中塊壘。就是寫戰國策的人，繪聲繪影，也可說是借題發揮，有感而發。再進一層說，這篇文字，能够傳誦到今日，而大家讀了，還能「有動於中」「擊節贊嘆」，也因爲我們的社會，人情，跟蘇秦那時，沒有什麼截然不同呀！</p>
<p>一般憂世之士，常常慨歎，說「人心不古」。像蘇秦和他的妻，他的嫂，終可算做古人了。可是，這幾顆古心，未見得比今高明多少！</p>
<p>蘇秦和他的妻•他的嫂，軀殼早已腐朽了。但是，像這種型的人，郤世世不絕。所以，「誰謂古今人不相及也」</p>
<h3>「魯男子」觀後感</h3>
<p>— 芒刺</p>
<p>曾孟樸的「魯男子」，是一部悲歡離合的言情小說，民初會風行一時，但時至今日，再來讀牠，就不免因牠的幼稚陳腐而失笑。廣告譽之爲「媲美紅樓夢，遠勝西廂記，」此廣告之所以爲廣告也。「紅樓夢」里許多人物，我們現在想起來，還是栩栩如生的，但是，「魯男子」現在有誰還記得牠呢？羅明先生在序言中說：「魯男子給我的印象最深，我有時候覺得我好像就是魯男子，」到現在再來說這樣的話的，恐怕只有羅明先生一人吧！誠然，魯男子在當時曾經創過出版記錄，若以銷路多寡來判斷優劣的話，未始不能說牠是一部「佳作」。但「魯男子」而有改編上演的價值，「廣陵潮」，一九尾龜」……等，不是都可以改編上演了麼？</p>
<p>上面說過，「魯男子」是民國初年，剛接觸到西歐新文藝時一部「小脚放大式」的所謂「新小說」。不料羅明先生百分之百地「忠實」於原著，使原作固有的對話，人物，情節……都原封不動地保存了下來。這决演出，倘還有一看的價值的話，那就是把牠當成我們孩童時代一幀蠢態可掬的照片，看了笑一笑而已。對話完全是「笑舞臺」風的。橫一句「心愛的哥哥呀，」豎一句「我的好妹子呀，」肉麻當有趣，聞之令人作嘔吧。</p>
<p>站在嚴格的近代話劇立塲上，「魯男子」　劇方面，沒有伏錢，沒有高潮。開頭側重魯男子，入後魯男子不見提起，反而側重「副主題」的孫景路去了。就是說，「大主題」與「副主題」沒有交錯地發展，首尾不能呼應。劇情平淡而又平淡，完全是叙述故事式的。就連故事也叙述得笨不可言。舉例明之，如第二幕第二景，魯男子失戀後躺在凉亭里做夢，燈光一黑，轉成陰凄凄的陰府，判官審問他何以如此負心，他大呼寃枉，緊要關頭燈光又是一黑，又恢復到原來的凉亭，魯男子仍在大呼寃枉。看到這里，觀衆沒有不失笑的。試問，這算是什麼戲呢？此外，魯男子出門跌一交，臉上鮮血直流，朱小雄爬樹被毒蛇咬傷……笑話不一而足。無論什麼藝衛，妙處就在「提得輕打得重」，然而看了羅明先生的大作，令人覺得：劇作者在使盡吃奶的力氣，觀衆却還是一個「莫明其妙。」</p>
<p>說到導演，許多塲面都採用的是「二二交替制」（恕我杜撰這個名詞）。這就是說：兩個演員站在臺中央，左一右，站得太久了，右面的換到左面，左面的就換到右面，如此而已。</p>
<p>演技呢，還是孫景路值得一看，允以臨終一塲演得最爲動人。冷山的魯男子，楞頭楞腦，毫無眉淸目秀的書生氣。吳景平尚稱職。立里唸臺辭，始終是她一貫哀怨的調子，殊少變化。馬笑儂，沙漠，費茵，動作都太近代化，與劇本很不調和。吳純眞每决演戲都給人笑柄，說話已經怪聲怪氣，有時還要加上鼻子的牽動，嘴吧的歪扭，似乎不很雅觀的。</p>
<h3>從「有眼與無眼」説起</h3>
<p>— 盾</p>
<p>「有眼與無眼」。這是一本所謂「童話」，便是專門寫給小朋友讀的小書。三十多年前無錫孫毓修先生譯爲漢文，在上海出版，他之介紹西洋童話；倒不是因爲猶有童心，而是見到道種工作實在需要。他翻譯了二十三種童話，其中屬於「有眼無眼」類的總也有這麼七八種，最可以，最受歡迎的，據說還是「大母指」「無貓國」這一類幻想的童話。</p>
<p>這一件事，似乎並不稀奇，然而未始也不可以誇張一下，說是可以「看出重大的意義來，」例如歸源於「中國人之缺乏科學頭腦。」因爲「有眼與無眼」這種小書，正是以自然科學常識爲內客的一本讀物，什麼「中國人缺乏科學頭腦。」這句話，我是不相信的，許多科學上的基本原理不是先由中國發明的麼？不過「中國缺乏科學敎育」則是事實。</p>
<p>好讀「見童文學」的先生們，不大會看得起「有眼與無眼」的。因爲這不是安徒生或格林兄弟的著作。但是我們似乎不應該有這種偏見了。兒童心理學者雖然從科學立塲來說明見童心理發展，首先須經過「野蠻期」與「原人期」，但是，倘以爲因此須說鬼！必須九天仙女與冬瓜成親，才能滿足，小野蠻的兒童們之好奇心與幻想欲，則未必似乎合於科學的罷，每一民族的口頭文墨中，誠然有不少這樣怪誕奇幻的東西，而且歷來以之作爲幼小者的最初的「精神食糧」的，但是，似乎亦應該視爲「蠻性的遺留」，而謚以「不合敎育原理」罷，</p>
<p>這些話，也許是無的放矢，因爲眼前我們似乎連「大母指」與「無貓國」也沒有，這裏的兒童們一長了齒就開始　　他父母所必須的　，然而，正因爲如此倒留下了一塊好讓關心兒童讀物的人們一試身手的好園地。</p>
<p>「有眼與無眼」在今日也該歸入落伍隊中了罷！這本小書雖然方法是對的，而早是這一類兒童讀敎的前輩，使材料之不免於稍嫌陳舊，是必然的。因爲在最近八十年來，生物學之進步，已經值得動植物學的有些頗有歷史的理論，不得不加以修正，而居禮夫婦的偉大貢獻，尤其使所有自然科學各部門，都提出了新問題，增加了新的「假定」，所以從前之「有眼」，今或不免爲「無眼」，其不留於書林，或者也是不足惜的，好在有新的眼；更巨的眼，已在我們左近。</p>
<p>在此萬方多難之頃，拉拉扯扯談這「不急之務」可謂迂闊，但是我們相信科學知識是一切知識中之最基本的，尤其對於小朋友們。（酬移濟貧金）</p>

<p>他們倆都那樣熱心地計劃着將來的共同生活；不過他對於這件事，不免有些看得嚴重，甚至還有些畏懼。當然，她到勃洛克菲爾德來是很好的；其他的舍監都已經結過婚。她又告訴過他，她喜歡兒童，也會在他們裏面過着好好的生活。『喔，吉普斯，你就是這樣的你，我是何等地高興呀。我正怕你是一個律師，或一個股票掮客，或一個牙醫，或一個在曼徹斯德（Manchester）有極大棉業的商人。這是說我初决遇見你的時候。學校敎師就很不同了，很重要了，你想是麼，那些孩子是在長大起來，並且對於世界是有關係的，現在要去誘導他們……」（十一）</p>

<h3>Enhancing Agricultural Production in Wartime</h3>
<p>Abundant agricultural production is one of the material conditions supporting the war. If we hope to sustain the current long-term Second World War and strive for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War, in addition to political unity and enlightenment, we cannot ignore economic conditions, especially the replenishment of abundant agricultural products.</p>
<p>China is the largest agricultural country in East Asia, and the agricultural economy is the main form of the Chinese national economy. However, when it comes to agricultural production, we cannot be "carefree." On the contrary, the dynamics of Chinese rural areas deserve our greatest attention. Due to the exploitation of long-standing feudal relationships and the invasion of Britain and the United States over the past century, China's rural economy has been exhausted. Long-term poverty has eroded farmers' ability to improve production. Everyone is struggling and relying on the weather. In recent years, due to Chongqing's protracted war, "abandoned fields" have become the most common phenomenon. Within the peace zones, after more than two years, it seems that cultivation is still possible. However, due to the impact of rising prices of grain and other crops, the differentiation of rural areas has intensified, and there is no talk of improving the general productivity of farmers. Jiangpu was originally a rice-producing area, but the seriousness of the food problem is still unexpectedly severe. Although the most important reason is not production, insufficient production is clearly a major factor. Now that the National Government has declared war, due to the wartime needs of both China and Japan, increasing agricultural production should be an important task at present.</p>
<p>In order to increase agricultural production, we should expand crops immediately. To ensure the regular harvest of agricultural products, we should also mobilize refugees to reclaim wasteland. At the same time, we should work hard on water conservancy and afforestation, and strive to guide farmers to improve seeds and soil. However, if socio-economic relations are not improved, all scientific and technological means cannot be applied to actual production. Because reclaiming wasteland is not something that farmers can do with their bare hands, water conservancy and afforestation are not within the power of a few farmers, and improving seeds and soil is not something that impoverished farmers can undertake.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to truly increase agricultural production, we must provide economic assistance to the vast agricultural sector. The first thing is to promote agricultural loans. However, we should avoid the reasons for the failure of agricultural loans by the Chongqing government. In recent years, agricultural loans have been popular in Chongqing, but the true farmers who need funds cannot obtain loans. Some farmers who obtain loans do not use the funds for production but for paying rent, taxes, and debts. On the other hand, local bullies and evil gentry use their special status to borrow large amounts of funds and use them to lend at high interest rates. In the rural areas of various provinces under the Chongqing regime, aren't 80 percent of the credit cooperatives actually disguised usury institutions? This is not increasing agricultural production, but exploiting farmers and destroying the rural economy. How can we talk about increasing agricultural production? Today, to implement agricultural loans in the peace zones, we must establish reasonable credit cooperatives, relax guarantee conditions so that farmers can borrow funds, and reduce past interest rates to alleviate the burden on farmers.</p>
<p>However, it is not enough to simply implement agricultural loans and solve the funding problem for agricultural production. The accumulated burdens are heavily pressing on farmers, and they cannot work hard to increase agricultural production with peace of mind. Therefore, secondly, we must reduce the various unreasonable and unfair burdens on farmers. The first is to implement rent reduction for individual farmers. At the same time, reduce or eliminate unreasonable donations and taxes for tenant farmers and small landowners to relieve the strength of small and medium-sized farmers. Otherwise, while implementing agricultural loans, if we still retain the harsh taxes on farmers, and even increase new-style and seasonal donations and taxes for war reasons, we are not actually increasing national income, but preventing agricultural production, which violates the meaning of participating in the war.</p>
<p>In recent years, some of the floating capital in Shanghai and other major cities has flowed into rural areas. Some people say that this is a good sign for the development of rural areas. This is a one-sided view. Originally, investment of floating capital in rural production should be encouraged. However, in reality, when we investigate the situation of floating capital flowing into rural areas, we find that it is greatly mistaken. Because the main manifestation is not the excitement of rural production gaining funds, but the transfer of land ownership. In particular, it shows the centralization of land ownership. The number of owner-farmers and small landlords is drastically reduced, while a small number of floating capital owners become the new masters and new landlords of vast rural areas. When landlords move, tenant farmers follow suit. If they do not want to lose their cultivated land, they have to endure the pain of increased rent. In response to this phenomenon, we should find ways to protect tenant farmers' tenancy rights, prohibit unreasonable rent increases so that farmers can produce with peace of mind, and prohibit the large-scale abandonment of land and non-production, so that those who inject floating capital into rural areas are not engaged in land speculation, but truly support production.</p>
<p>In addition, we should also reasonably improve the burden of land taxes and wartime donations and taxes on tenant farmers and small and medium-sized farmers, and prohibit landlords from passing on their burdens to tenant farmers, owner-farmers, and small landlords. After these malpractices are eliminated, we should strive to promote rural transportation and marketing cooperative businesses to avoid the exploitation of commercial capital.</p>
<p>For the actual needs of participating in the war, we must earnestly implement the above measures to increase agricultural production. This is not only a technical issue, but requires efforts to improve land policy, food policy, financial policy, and other aspects. Otherwise, all fine-sounding slogans and good-looking policies will not have any practical effect.</p>
<h3>Supreme National Defense Council Held Its First Meeting Yesterday, Approved the General Budget of National Revenue and Expenditure, and Resolved to Reorganize Administrative Institutions</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Supreme National Defense Council held its first meeting yesterday (the 13th). (A) Reporting matters: (1) Reading the minutes of the temporary meeting of the Central Political Committee on January 9, 1943; (2) Chairman's report: According to the outline of the organization of the Supreme National Defense Council, Chen Gongbo, a standing member of the Military Affairs Commission, has been designated as a member of the Council. (B) Matters for discussion: (1) The chairman submitted a draft of the organizational regulations of the Supreme National Defense Council for public decision (attached regulations). Resolved to pass and send to the National Government. (2) The chairman submitted a draft of the organizational regulations of the secretariat of the Supreme National Defense Council for public decision. Resolved to pass. (3) The chairman submitted a report from the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance on the preparation of the general budget of national revenue and expenditure for the first half of the 32nd year for approval. Resolved to pass and send to the National Government for compliance and to the Legislative Yuan for record. (4) The chairman submitted a report from the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance on the proposal to change the consolidated tobacco tax and temporary special tax to ad valorem taxation, with an attached revised tax rate schedule for approval. Resolved to pass and to instruct the Ministry of Finance through the Executive Yuan to draft a revised draft of the relevant provisions of the Tobacco Consolidation Tax Regulations for approval and to submit it to the Legislative Yuan for record. The date of implementation shall be determined by order of the Ministry of Finance. (5) The chairman submitted a proposal on reforming administrative institutions, with the original proposal attached. Resolved to pass and send to the National Government and the Legislative Yuan for record. (6) The chairman submitted a proposal to elect Cen Degong and Chen Jicheng as members of the National Government, Chen Junhui as Minister of Construction, Gu Baoheng as Minister of Food, and Ding Mocun as Minister of Social Welfare for public decision. Resolved to pass and send to the National Government.</p>
<p>Measures for Reforming Administrative Institutions</p>
<p>(A) Principles of reorganization: (1) The organs of the Executive Yuan shall adopt a single system in principle to clarify responsibilities and achieve agility. (2) The number of members in each ministry shall vary according to their duties and need not be uniform. For those changed from committees to ministries, the number of members used shall not exceed the number at the time of the committee. This does not apply if the duties are increased compared to the past. (3) In the executive organs, vigorously correct the malpractice of overstaffing, reduce the current number, and set up consultation organs to attract talents. (B) Institutional adjustments: (1) It is proposed to change the National Economic Commission currently under the Executive Yuan to be under the National Government to achieve the practical effect of promoting national economic construction and improving the lives of the people. (2) The New People's Movement is the foundation for the revival of China and the preservation of East Asia. In order to ensure that all the people of the country adhere to it, it is proposed to change the New People's Movement Promotion Committee, which is currently under the Executive Yuan, to be under the National Government. (3) Personnel administration is closely related. It is more reasonable for the Ministry of Personnel Affairs to belong to the Executive Yuan than to the Examination Yuan, because examination and personnel affairs are actually two separate matters. For the Ministry of Personnel Affairs belonging to the Examination Yuan, the Examination Yuan has not seen its connection, while the Executive Yuan has many barriers. It is proposed to change the Ministry of Personnel Affairs currently under the Examination Yuan to be under the Executive Yuan. (4) Since the Central Political Committee re-established the principles for guiding people's organizations, the duties of the Social Movement Guidance Committee have changed. It is proposed to merge the committee with the Relief Commission into a Department of Social Welfare to manage social welfare planning and charitable affairs. The original political guidance for social movements shall also be under its management. The original administrative systems of the two committees in various provinces and cities shall be changed to Social Welfare Bureaus to handle all social welfare matters under the command of the Minister of Social Welfare. In the future, matters related to social welfare shall be transferred by the provincial and municipal governments to the responsible departments for handling by the bureau to unify the authority. (5) It is proposed to change the Food Management Committee into a Department of Food to comprehensively manage national food production, allocation, and management. The existing food institutions in various provinces and cities shall remain as before, handling food affairs in their respective provinces and cities under the command of the Minister of Food, striving for no waste of funds and real benefits for the people. (6) The situation in the border areas is special. All administrative affairs cannot be compared with the provinces in the interior. Therefore, there is a Border Affairs Committee. However, in these times of trouble, the committee has been extremely idle. It is proposed to abolish the Border Affairs Committee currently under the Executive Yuan and establish a Border Affairs Bureau directly under the Ministry of Interior to supervise border affairs and improve border politics under the command of the Minister of Interior. The existing liaison office in Nanjing shall continue to be set up to communicate information. (7) The emigration and protection of overseas Chinese originally belonged to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. However, these matters are closely related to diplomacy. It is proposed to abolish the commission and establish an Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau directly under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The bureau shall have a director, changed to a simple appointment, to handle all matters related to overseas Chinese under the command of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The original offices stationed in various places shall be instructed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to draft adjustment measures for approval and compliance. (8) Water conservancy and transportation are both major parts of construction. It is proposed to merge the Water Conservancy Commission into the Ministry of Transportation and change it to a Department of Construction to manage water conservancy, transportation, and urban construction affairs to unify authority. (9) In order to improve administrative efficiency, the internal organization of the Executive Yuan should be simplified. The three organs of the Secretariat, the Office of Counselors, and the Legal Bureau shall be merged into one with a Secretary-General to comprehensively manage affairs, assisted by two Deputy Secretaries-General. (10) Each existing ministry has a Political Vice Minister and an Administrative Vice Minister. The authority is hampered and causes trouble. It is proposed to abolish the Political Vice Minister and the Administrative Vice Minister of each ministry and establish one Vice Minister in each ministry to assist the minister in handling ministry affairs to increase efficiency. (C) Personnel arrangements: (1) Each ministry may establish a committee as an advisory and recommendation body, with three to five members, simply appointed, without setting up an office or secretaries. (2) The remaining personnel below the recommendation level shall be organized into an inquiry committee, with the Vice Ministers of each ministry as members and the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan as the chairman, to seriously inquire about the talents, character, and qualifications of the remaining personnel. If they are still competent, they shall be assigned to various departments and bureaus at the original level. Those who are old and frail or have been ineffective in their work shall be dismissed uniformly. Dismissal measures shall be determined separately. (3) The civil servants of the existing organs shall undergo a temporary performance appraisal by their respective supervisors within one month after the approval and implementation of these measures and submit them for approval. (4) The number of personnel below the section chief of each existing department shall be clearly stipulated and submitted for approval and compliance. Unnecessary and ineffective personnel shall be dismissed immediately. (5) The number of personnel in newly established organs shall be reduced as much as possible and the number shall be submitted for approval and compliance in advance. (D) Revision of laws and regulations and others: (1) For each Yuan and department whose organization has been changed, the responsible supervisor shall revise the relevant laws and regulations and submit them for approval and handling. (2) For each newly established organ approved, the responsible supervisor shall draft them quickly and submit them for approval and handling. (3) For the organizational law and other relevant laws and regulations of each abolished organ, which have been announced by the National Government, the Secretariat of the Central Political Committee shall be requested to list them and submit them to the National Government for explicit abolition. (4) The budgets of newly established, merged, or reorganized organs shall be drafted by the responsible supervisor as soon as possible according to the following standards: (1) For two organs merged into one, the budget of the new organ shall not exceed 80% of the total budget of the original two organs. (2) For a committee reduced to a bureau, the budget shall not exceed 70% of the original committee's budget. (3) For a committee changed to a department, the budget shall not exceed the original committee's budget. (4) If the original organs need to increase funding to accommodate dismissed personnel, it shall be paid from the funds saved by the merged or reorganized organs, but the total amount shall not exceed 80% of the total savings. For merged or reorganized organs, funding shall be issued according to the original budget for January and according to the new budget from February. (5) For each abolished organ, the responsible supervisor shall send the inventory of assets to the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan for inventory and safekeeping and submit it for reallocation to emphasize public property. (6) For each abolished organ, all surplus funds from previous years shall be submitted by the responsible supervisor to the national treasury for a receipt and reported to the Executive Yuan for record. No requests shall be made for use without reason to emphasize public funds. (7) For organs merged, the staff shall be limited to those from the original two organs. No new personnel shall be hired in addition to the original personnel. However, transferred personnel are not subject to this restriction.</p>
<p>Organizational Regulations of the National Defense Council</p>
<p>Organizational Regulations of the Supreme National Defense Council: (1) The Central Political Committee shall establish the Supreme National Defense Council in wartime to decide on important matters concerning national defense. (2) In wartime, the Central Political Committee shall make emergency decisions when the situation requires it. It may suspend the effect of existing laws, and for legal bills, it may omit legal procedures when necessary and send them directly to the National Government for promulgation and to the Legislative Yuan for record. (3) The Central Political Committee shall meet once a month in wartime. During the recess, its powers shall be exercised by the Supreme National Defense Council. (4) The Supreme National Defense Council shall meet once a week and may hold temporary meetings when necessary. Matters decided by the Supreme National Defense Council shall be reported when the Central Political Committee meets. (5) The Chairman of the Central Political Committee shall be the Chairman of the Supreme National Defense Council. (6) The members of the Supreme National Defense Council shall be: the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission and one standing member, the President and Vice President of the Executive Yuan, the Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Committee, the Chief of General Staff, the Minister of the Army, the Minister of the Navy, the Ministers of Interior, Foreign Affairs, Finance, Industry, and Propaganda, and the Central and local military and political leaders. When necessary, the Chairman of the Supreme National Defense Council may order them to attend or attend as observers. (7) The Supreme National Defense Council shall have one Secretary-General, who shall be the Secretary-General of the Central Political Committee, and two Deputy Secretaries-General, who shall be the Deputy Secretaries-General of the Central Political Committee, as well as the Secretary-General of the Economic Commission, the Political Vice Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Director-General of the General Affairs Office of the Industry Committee, with the treatment of Deputy Secretary-General.</p>

<p>Main Points of the Leader's Instructions</p>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - The first meeting of the New People's Movement Promotion Association was held in Nanjing on the 13th of this month, presided over by Chairman Wang, who gave earnest instructions. The main points are as follows: (1) Last year was the preparation period for the theory and holding of the New People's Movement, and this year is the implementation period of the New People's Movement. (2) After China's participation in the Greater East Asia War, the New People's Movement has its practical focus. The leader specifically clarified the true motives and great significance of the total participation in the war, and pointed out the erroneous thinking of the general public on the issue of participation in the war, pointing out that in the era of national groups and the era of war, there is absolutely no possibility of isolating oneself from the war to recuperate and develop. China's participation in the war is a necessary step to achieve the revival of China and defend East Asia, and explained that China's participation in the war is purely in a spirit of initiative, based on a determination of life and death. The leader further stated that the war from now on will be a long-term war and a total war. The most important thing in this is the unity of the 1 billion people of East Asia, sharing weal and woe, and living and dying together, which will be enough to defeat the evil forces of the new order. Our total participation in the war is based on the determination made since the peace movement in the subjective sense, and in the objective sense, it is based on the expectation of sincere unity of the East Asian nations by friendly Japan, and it is an act of solemnity. (3) The comrades of the New People's Movement work, standing in the position of leaders of the people of the whole country, should pay attention to arousing the spirit of sacrifice, the spirit of unity, and the spirit of training among the people in their future work, and make them organized and disciplined actions. (4) The practice of the New People's Movement lies in making the awareness of participation in the war universal and profound, and with regard to increasing production and ensuring public security, one must also lead by example and take the spirit of hard work as the first. For the general youth and the general national organization training, each should work hard in their own positions. (5) In the implementation of the New People's Movement, attention must be paid to breaking down individualism, eliminating the bad habits of factionalism, breaking down bureaucracy, and eliminating the bad habits of superficiality, so as to create a new social atmosphere. (6) In conclusion, the leader encouraged all to bear the responsibility of the Greater East Asia War with the spirit of the New People's Movement, and to achieve China's freedom and equality and the co-existence and co-prosperity of East Asia with the victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Resolution to Follow Instructions</p>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - The New People's Movement Promotion Meeting followed the leader's instructions in the following resolution:</p>
<p>The New People's Movement Promotion Meeting was held in the capital on January 13, 1943. We respectfully heard the leader personally preside over the meeting and give instructions on the future plan, with earnest instruction and encouragement. All the attendees of the meeting were greatly excited upon hearing it, and deeply felt the bright future of reviving China and defending East Asia. We are more aware of the importance of total mobilization to assist friendly countries in fulfilling the responsibilities of the war. As the New People's Movement has entered the stage of concrete practice from the stage of propaganda, we vow to follow the leader's instructions and implement the resolutions of the conference, and strive to realize the following items in the General Mobilization of National Spirit: (1) The people of the whole country deeply realize the common destiny of China and Japan, and the safety of China and the safety of East Asia are inseparable. Completing the Greater East Asia War is a step to realize the Father of the Nation's Pan-Asianism, and it is also the only way to build a new China and build a new East Asia. (2) Train the youth, organize the masses, eliminate personal opinions, eliminate factions, and concentrate spiritual unity under the leadership of the leader to establish a central force for reviving China and defending East Asia. (3) Promote diligence among young people, and organize and train young people at the same time. In terms of spiritual education and ideological training, make the meaning of total participation in the war universal and profound. In terms of labor service and various activities, do our best and work hard in our own positions to engage in increasing production, cooperate in ensuring public security, develop people's strength, enrich national strength, and contribute everything to the country. (4) Support and guide young people, and use young people to lead young people, so that they can be actively and spontaneously active under organized leadership, cultivate a solemn spirit of democratic centralism, and eradicate the bad habits of individualism and laissez-faireism of the past youth. (5) Popularize the correct awareness of national groupism and strictly prevent the negative tendencies of narrow nationalism. (6) Complete the basic national organization under the wartime system. (7) Realize the eight major guidelines of the New People's Movement. This resolution is hereby made, and we respectfully pay our greatest respect to the leader.</p>

<h3>Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee Opens This Morning in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Fifth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party is scheduled to open this morning (the 14th) in Nanjing. Members of the Central Committee from various regions have arrived in Nanjing one after another. At 9:00 AM, all Central Committee members will respectfully pay their respects at the Mausoleum of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and hold the opening ceremony of the Fifth Plenary Session in the memorial hall.

<h3>Japanese Information Bureau Spokesman Receives Foreign Journalists to Analyze British and American Attitudes Toward Chongqing</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - Mr. Hori, spokesman for the Information Bureau, stated today while receiving foreign journalists that the United States and Britain were quite apprehensive about Japan's swift decision to abolish extraterritorial rights and concessions in China. Therefore, on January 11th, they concluded an agreement with Chongqing, promising to renounce the special privileges they enjoyed under the Boxer Protocol of 1901 (including the right to station troops in North China, extraterritorial rights, and privileges related to treaty ports, inland navigation, and coastal trade). They also promised to return the administrative rights to the Peking Legation Quarter and the Shanghai and Kulangsu International Settlements, as well as the British concessions. On the surface, this action appears to return a large number of rights to Chongqing, but in reality, it is all empty words. The return of administrative rights to the concessions only applies to five areas: the Shanghai and Kulangsu International Settlements, the Peking Legation Quarter, and the British concessions in Tianjin and Guangzhou. However, these areas are currently occupied by the Japanese army, and the British cannot discuss retaining or returning them. Regarding the British and American promise to renounce their privileges concerning treaty ports, inland navigation, and coastal trade, this is nothing more than an empty gesture. Before the war, when Britain and the United States still had trade relations and could send ships to navigate the coast and the Yangtze River, this move would have had some significance. However, today, British and American forces have been completely driven out of East Asia, and their trade and inland navigation no longer exist, so this move is meaningless. Now that the British and American troops stationed in North China have all become prisoners, renouncing the right to station troops in North China only adds a "laughingstock" to the entire agreement.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou New Life Movement Branch Officially Established</h3>
<p>Hangzhou, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Hangzhou branch of the New Life Movement Promotion Committee is now fully prepared and was officially established today (the 13th). All personnel appointments have also been announced, and the work of promoting the New Life Movement in Hangzhou will soon be launched.</p>
<h3>Fu Bingchang Appointed Chongqing Envoy to the Soviet Union</h3>

Mr. Fu succeeds Shao Lizi, who recently resigned and returned to Chongqing.</p>
<h3>Washington Dispatch: Regarding the American Election - The Democratic Party Barely Maintains Its Advantage, While the Republican Party Has Made Significant Gains - Transmitted from Macau on January 10th</h3>
<p>The results of the American congressional and gubernatorial elections were announced on November 4th. The Democratic Party still maintains a controlling advantage, but the Republican Party, after its setbacks in the 1940 general election, has shown significant gains in this election, which is noteworthy. Although the election campaign this time did not arouse great enthusiasm, the American presidential election, held every four years, is about to take place in two years. It is difficult to predict whether the World War will be over by then, and everyone expects Roosevelt to step down after his third term. Therefore, this election, while proceeding calmly, still contains considerable future significance.</p>
<p>According to the American political system, the term of senators is six years, with one-third of the seats being re-elected every two years. The term of representatives in the House is two years, and all seats are re-elected at the end of the term. The term of governors varies depending on the laws of each state, with two-year and four-year terms. Their elections are held concurrently with the congressional elections. In the current election, thirty-two governors, thirty-five senators, and four hundred and thirty-two representatives are to be elected. Maine, according to precedent, already elected one Republican governor, one senator, and three representatives in September. According to the unconfirmed election results received so far, the Republican Party holds 38 seats in the Senate, the Democratic Party holds 58 seats, the Republican Party has won 208 seats in the House, and the Democratic Party has won 220 seats. No reports have been received on the gubernatorial elections. Let's look at the results of the previous two elections!</p>
<p>1938 Election (76th Congress)</p>
<p>Senate House</p>
<p>Democrats 69 262</p>
<p>Republicans 23 170</p>
<p>Other 4 3</p>
<p>1940 Election (77th Congress)</p>
<p>Democrats 65 258</p>
<p>Republicans 29 165</p>
<p>Other 2 12</p>
<p>We can clearly see that the Republican Party's gains in this election are a significant phenomenon. If this had occurred during peacetime, the opposition party could have hindered the government's measures at any time, which would have had an unfavorable impact. This phenomenon was very pronounced during the later period of President Hoover's administration.</p>
<p>If the current World War ends before the next American presidential election in November 1944, what possible impact will result based on the results of the current election? According to the past precedents of American party history, the Democratic Party has often been in power during periods of complexity and crisis. Wilson and Roosevelt successively shouldered the heavy responsibility of two world wars, while the Republican Party has often been in power during times of peace. This may be a coincidence and not a fixed rule, but observing the active nature of the American people, it is not impossible for the responsibility of post-war reconstruction to fall on the shoulders of the Republican Party. Currently, the platforms of the two major American parties do not have obvious differences. Their alternation of power in foreign policy does not give cause for major concern. What we are interested in is the question of who will be the officeholders.</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Authorities Protect Prisoners of War, Providing Them with Air Raid Shelters to Avoid Bombing by Their Own Country</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 17th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese military authorities are now providing air raid shelters to prisoners of war detained here to protect them from indiscriminate bombing by their own aircraft. This move is deeply appreciated by the British prisoners of war. The enemy, however, has not stopped its acts of violence against innocent people, such as the British aircraft bombing a Japanese medical ship in the port of Rangoon on January 5th, and indiscriminately bombing temples and civilian houses in Rangoon on December 12th last year, as well as bombing a hospital in Lashio, causing many civilian casualties in Burma and India.</p>

<h3>British and American Ambassadors to Turkey Confer Repeatedly to Adjust Activities Towards Turkey</h3>
<p>Istanbul, Turkey (Havas News Agency dispatch) - Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador to Turkey, and Steinhardt, the American Ambassador to Turkey, met several times last week.

<h3>U.S. Acknowledges Naval Losses, Intended to Pass Budget; Japanese Spokesman Explains U.S. President's Motives</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - Hori, a spokesman for the Information Bureau, stated today while receiving foreign journalists that the U.S. Navy finally admitted yesterday to losing the 19,900-ton aircraft carrier Wasp and ten other warships in the Solomon Islands because the Roosevelt administration needed some alarming news to urge Congress to pass a war budget of $100 billion. The losses admitted by the United States this time are greater than the losses it has admitted in the past, but the U.S. Navy authorities have still not disclosed the most important part of their losses, namely one battleship and two aircraft carriers. On December 16th last year, the Japanese General Headquarters announced that the total losses of the U.S. Navy in that naval battle in the South Pacific were one battleship, three aircraft carriers, another aircraft carrier of unknown type that was also sunk, and three other warships of unknown type that were also severely damaged.</p>
<h3>Grew Writes a Book Warning His Countrymen That Japanese Strength Should Not Be Underestimated</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Former U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Joseph Grew, repeatedly warned his countrymen of their insufficient understanding of Japan after returning to the United States. He also wrote a book entitled "Report from Tokyo," which was published on December 7th last year. The main points are summarized as follows: On December 7, 1941, the day of the Pearl Harbor attack, many questions arose in our minds. I will address and answer two points. (1) Why did Japan go to war with Britain and the United States? The Japanese have always regarded the British and American people as inferior and weak, while regarding themselves as a strong and excellent nation. This view seems very reasonable and has a basis. Most Japanese believe that being able to endure a difficult life is culture, that they are tireless in diligence and war, and that Oriental culture is completely opposed to the luxurious enjoyment of Europe and America. Although I do not want to praise the enemy, I cannot help but point out the following: (A) Internal unity: In addition to respecting the sacredness of the Emperor, the Japanese people unanimously support the government. In Japan, no individual or group is dissatisfied with the government. (B) Training: Whether Japanese armaments are excellent or not is another matter. In short, they are very willing to abide by the rules, and training is very widespread throughout the country. They firmly believe that once Japanese men enlist in the army, they can fight against the armies of Britain and the United States. (C) Excellent quality: It is no exaggeration to say that the Japanese have built prosperity on poverty. (D) The Japanese firmly believe that in war, they should trust the government and all national policies. (2) Why are the Japanese so confident in victory? The Japanese believe that Britain and the United States underestimate Japan, and the internal divisions within Britain and the United States during wartime and before the war have further increased the Japanese people's belief in victory. The greatest reason for the Japanese army's victory is the strength of its morale. Many British and Americans believe that the Japanese army is useless due to the stalemate in the Sino-Japanese War, but they do not know that they are preparing resources for an even greater war.</p>

<h3>Compulsory Purchase of Rice Stockpiled Around Shanghai; Grain Administration to Be Implemented Within the Blockade Line; Rationed Rice for Households Will Be Increased</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the major commodity rationing system adopted by the authorities to stabilize people's livelihoods, whether it is rice, grains, cooking oil, sugar, soap, matches, or tobacco, regardless of the differences in the form of implementation, the principle is the same, because their highest governing bodies have the same origin. In order to rectify the efficiency of rationing, it is stipulated that all rationed goods must strictly abide by the following regulations when sold: (1) Not violate the official price; (2) Not mix in impurities; (3) Not have insufficient quantity; (4) Rationed goods must not be hoarded; (5) Must not exceed the sales limit; (6) Must not violate the public notices posted inside and outside the store. Anyone who violates the above regulations will have their rationing suspended in minor cases and their rationing qualifications permanently revoked in serious cases.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Have Fallen in the Suburbs of Shanghai</h3>
<p>Domei News Agency Shanghai Dispatch: After the Japanese authorities and the Municipal Government announced on Tuesday a ban on the private transport of important food grains from the "cleared areas" into the Shanghai area, rice prices in Songjiang, Qingpu, Jiaxing, and Pinghu around Shanghai fell sharply. The routes for the private transport of rice and other food grains between the "cleared areas" and Shanghai have now been completely cut off. The standard rice prices in the rural areas are now decoupled from the black market rice prices in Shanghai. Observers believe that grain prices will continue to fall in the coming days and cannot return to normal levels. The local authorities will now be able to purchase more food grains at lower prices for the citizens of Shanghai.</p>
<p>French Concession Suppressing Black Market</p>
<p>The French Concession authorities stated yesterday their determination to cooperate with the Japanese side and the Public Concession authorities to jointly suppress all speculation and black market activities in order to stabilize the livelihoods of civilians. They solemnly declared that they would take severe measures against all violators. The French authorities also expressed their willingness to unite with the residents of the French Concession and said that they would not stop taking punitive steps until they had achieved their goal of ensuring that residents obtained the main foods they needed. Finally, the French authorities also informed the public that they would continue to cooperate with the Japanese military authorities and fully adopt parallel measures regarding the notice published in the newspapers by the Japanese military authorities prohibiting the private sale of major food grains, including rice, corn, wheat, beans, and products made from the above food grains.</p>
<p>Compulsory Purchase of Stockpiled Rice</p>
<p>The reason why the authorities of all parties issued the order to prohibit the transportation of major food grains without permission this time is that although the rice harvest last autumn was said to be not bad, rice prices in the vicinity of Shanghai were still very high. This was probably due to hoarding, manipulation, and private smuggling abroad. Now that the authorities have issued an order prohibiting movement, the next step is to forcibly purchase stockpiled rice in Shanghai and the "cleared areas." As for the rice in the rice-producing areas, it will be purchased uniformly by the Grain Management Committee. The system of rationing rice according to population has been quite effective since it was implemented on July 6th last year. In order to fully supply the population with rationed grain, measures will be taken to increase the amount of rationed rice in Shanghai to meet the legitimate needs of poor households.</p>
<p>Rationed Rice for Households to Be Increased in the Next Period</p>
<p>It is reported that the contracted rice shops in the Public Concession and the French Concession have been notified by the Rice and Grain Office to collect the purchase orders for the twenty-fourth period at 10:00 a.m. today and pay and pick up the goods within the specified date. Sales will begin on the 21st of this month based on rice purchase certificates and flour purchase certificates. According to a reporter from Shanghai News Agency, who inquired with the rice industry yesterday, the amount of rationed rice for the twenty-fourth period will be increased to two sheng per person, and flour will be increased to two jin. It is also rumored that the rice is pure white rice, and there are plans to gradually increase it to four sheng per person per period. The exact amount will only be clear after the purchase orders are collected today.</p>
<p>Population Checks in the Blockade Area</p>
<p>After the implementation of grain rationing according to population in various districts within the blockade line of this city, whether the grain distribution in each district is accurate and fair is closely related to the population of each district. Therefore, the Municipal Grain Management Bureau has implemented random checks of household registration in various districts on specific days to prevent malfeasance and fraudulent claims of rations, and has revised the measures for checking household registration and submitted them to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. The areas for random checks are temporarily limited to the districts within the blockade line. This work will be carried out continuously without a fixed deadline. The number of households randomly checked in each district each month must be at least 2% of the total number. Except for the Nanshi area, which is directly handled by the Bureau, other districts will be handled by personnel dispatched by the Bureau in consultation with the district offices. If necessary, the Grain Bureau may directly dispatch personnel to conduct random checks to facilitate the increasingly thorough promotion of the Municipal Government's established grain policy. At the same time, in order to prevent malfeasance and extortion, all inspection personnel will be issued armbands by the Grain Bureau to show identification. When the inspection personnel are performing their duties, they should maintain close contact with the relevant Lianbao chiefs and local police officers. If it is found during the inspection that the household registration has changed for more than one month and has not yet been registered, the Lianbao chiefs concerned should be dealt with separately. If there is indeed malfeasance, once the responsible party is identified, they will be punished in the following ways: (1) Households: In minor cases, their right to purchase rice will be suspended for one or two times; in serious cases, their right to purchase rice will be suspended for one month. (2) Public granaries: In minor cases, a fine will be imposed; in serious cases, their qualifications to sell public rationed rice will be revoked. (3) The Lianbao chief will report to the Municipal Government for investigation and punishment in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Charitable Organizations' Purchase Has Been Agreed To</p>
<p>Regarding the problem of the rice and grain needed by charitable organizations such as soup kitchens and shelters, Ling Xianwen, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, told reporters from the Central News Agency yesterday that the Municipal Government is doing its best to find ways to consult with friendly agencies to dredge the situation. In general, friendly agencies have agreed to allow monthly purchases.</p>
<h3>With the Full Cooperation of Various Authorities, Rationing of Cooking Oil According to Population Will Be Implemented Immediately, With the Same Implementation Method as Rationing Grain According to Population</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cooking Oil Industry Wholesale Office, in order to universally supply cooking oil, adapt to the environment, eliminate the illegal activities of oil pressing gangs, and benefit the needs of citizens, with the approval of the military distribution authorities, implemented a new method of rationing oil according to population. Letters were sent to all registered retailers to solicit their opinions on undertaking the rationing of oil, but those who undertake the rationing of oil must have the ability to advance oil payments and guarantee money. The users of various retailers have registered to handle the rationing of oil according to population, and registration was closed on the 12th of this month. A reporter from this newspaper interviewed a person in charge yesterday, who said that preparations for rationing oil according to population have been actively underway and are inevitable. It has now been decided that with the full cooperation of the military distribution authorities, the Japanese Embassy Office, the Municipal Government, the Public Concession Works Department, the French Concession Directorate, and the Cooking Oil Industry Wholesale Office, it will be implemented in the near future. All implementation details have been submitted to the relevant authorities for thorough research and will be officially implemented by the authorities. As for the implementation method, it is roughly the same as the method of rationing grain according to population, which is based on the Baodjia household registration books, and oil purchase certificates are issued to households according to the population, and oil is purchased from designated oil retail stores. At present, the issuance of oil purchase certificates by each Lianbao district to households is only a temporary expedient measure. Regarding the rationing of oil according to population, the Wholesale Office has obtained the consent of the Municipal Police Bureau to assist, and it has been decided to conduct a pilot project in Nanshi. The Fangbaojia chiefs are responsible for filling in the household registration lists and reporting them within a time limit. The pre-determined method is to adopt grain rationing according to population, three periods per month, half a jin per person per period, and one and a half jin of oil per month is enough to meet the needs of one person.</p>
<p>Category A Oil Stores to Sell Today</p>
<p>Since the authorities ordered the wholesale office to divide the oil stores that sell at the door into Categories A, B, and C to sell oil in rotation, the phenomenon of crowding has been slightly reduced. Category B oil stores have stopped selling for some time, but because the procedures have not been completed, they will continue to sell oil for four days from today until 4:00 p.m. on the 17th. The method is to assist the Baojia chiefs in each district to issue oil purchase certificates to households, and residents can purchase oil with the certificates, so it is hoped that there will be no crowding in the oil stores.</p>
<h3>Notification from the Japanese Military Police Commander: Urging Registration of Radios, Deadline on the 18th, Strict Penalties for Late Registration, Inquiries Can Be Made by Telephone to the Broadcasting Supervision Office</h3>
<p>Regarding the prohibition of wireless radios, detailed measures were announced by both Chinese and Japanese authorities on December 18th of last year for the registration of prohibited radios, with a registration deadline set for the 18th of this month. It is now known that the commander of the Japanese military police in Shanghai issued a notification yesterday (the 13th) at 3:00 PM, stating: "Based on military necessity, the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army and Navy has previously announced and the military authorities have issued statements regarding the prohibition of advanced wireless radios in Central and Southern China. Recently, relevant agencies have implemented prohibition measures in accordance with regulations, with a planned deadline of the 18th of this month. However, it is understood that there are still many who have not completed the required procedures. This officer will take strict measures against those who violate the regulations, regardless of their nationality. It is earnestly hoped that those who have not completed the procedures will do so promptly before the deadline." In addition, in order to make the registration procedures clearer to citizens who own radios, the relevant authorities have listed the following points again and hope that they will be noted:</p>
<p>Points to Note for Radio Owners:</p>
<p>(1) Many errors were made during last summer's registration. Therefore, radio owners are urged to take their radios to the nearest radio shop or designated modification location for inspection as soon as possible. (2) If, during registration, it was stated that the radio had six or fewer tubes or did not have shortwave capability, but it actually has seven or more tubes or has shortwave capability, the registration certificate should be exchanged at the Broadcasting Supervision Office (316 Hardoon Building, Nanjing Road) or a designated modification location, and the required procedures should be completed. (3) If, during registration, it was stated that the radio had seven or more tubes but it actually has six or fewer tubes, or it was stated that it had shortwave capability but it actually does not, the same procedures as in item 2 should be followed. (4) Advanced radios with seven or more tubes should be registered at the application office without being modified first. Japanese people register at the consulate and police station. Others register at the Broadcasting Supervision Office, Room 316, Hardoon Building, Nanjing Road, outside of the concessions, but those in the city should register at the Municipal Police Bureau. (5) Radios with six or fewer tubes that can receive shortwave should be modified immediately. It is more convenient to do this at a designated location, as a certificate of inspection must be issued after modification. Therefore, those who modify at a non-designated location will still need to take it to a designated modification location. All designated locations have a sign that reads "Designated Modification Location of the China Broadcasting Association." (6) The use, possession, manufacture, or transfer of prohibited radios is absolutely not permitted for individuals, except for those who are required to do so for their duties. Japanese people apply to the consulate, police station, and others to the Municipal Police Bureau, the Works Department, and the Public Works Bureau. (7) All prohibited radios owned by radio shops, second-hand shops, pawnshops, etc., must also be registered. They are not allowed to be sold without certification from the military authorities. (8) Companies or organizations other than radio shops that have 30 or more modified radios will have their radios inspected by personnel dispatched by the China Broadcasting Association. A separate inspection fee will be charged, and an inspection and verification certificate will be issued. (9) Applications submitted in the form of letters, postcards, or telephone calls without completing the required forms will not be accepted. (10) Anyone attempting to evade this registration, such as temporarily hiding a radio or using the name of another person, will be punished according to military law as a violator of the proclamation. (11) Those who voluntarily offer to donate their radios will have them accepted by the Army and Navy Information Department. (12) If there are any unclear points regarding the handling of prohibited radios, Japanese people can inquire at the Shanghai Radio Station (telephone 46294), and others can inquire at the Broadcasting Supervision Office (telephone 19871). Those who wish to donate or sell to the military authorities should notify the Army and Navy Information Department. (13) Regardless of whether they are Chinese, Japanese, or foreigners, anyone who fails to complete the above procedures before the 18th will be severely punished.</p>

<h3>New Restrictions on Imported Goods Starting Next Fiscal Year: Items That Can Be Self-Supplied Will Not Be Imported; Allowable Imports Will Be Limited to Needed Quantities</h3>
<p>In order to adjust import trade, the relevant authorities previously commissioned the China Import Association to investigate various related information. This has now been completed satisfactorily. It has been decided that strict restrictions will be imposed on goods imported from Japan starting in the next fiscal year. The purpose of these import restrictions is to encourage and promote the development of industry in Central China. It is understood that according to the decision: (1) Goods that Chinese industry can self-supply will not be imported from Japan. (2) For goods that China absolutely needs from Japan, imports will be limited to the minimum amount. (3) For goods that have always been imported from Japan to China, if Japan cannot continue to produce them and prohibits exports, then these necessities must be produced in China. (4) If Japan has a surplus of certain goods and is allowed to ship them to China, the quantity will be limited to what China needs.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents' Association Forms Air Defense Team: Approximately 1,000 Members, Subjected to Air Defense Training</h3>

<h3>On the Movement for Women's Liberation</h3>
<p>— Ji Xin</p>
<p>Unless men are not prepared to marry, or there are no daughters in the family, separating men and women into two societies, who can say that the women's liberation movement is only a matter for women themselves?</p>
<p>China has reached its 32nd year [of the Republic], and the proposal for the women's liberation movement is no less than that number of years. The first woman to participate in her own liberation movement may already be an old lady, and the fate of the old lady is not much better than that of her mother, still "relying on her parents at home, and relying on her husband when she goes out."</p>
<p>The failure of the liberation movement, some people think, is due to the excessive pressure from men: it is true that there is no husband who does not hope that his wife can be a virtuous housewife, settling down with housework, rather having a warm family, not necessarily needing a wife who can earn money. The behavior arising from this psychology is certainly not conducive to the first step of the women's liberation movement - seeking employment, striving for equal economic status. This kind of psychology puts social environment into a reactionary public opinion, beginning to doubt, are the elder sisters who have received the same school education as the boys good wives? Those who consider themselves educators believe that women should still receive special education, and household chores are indispensable compulsory subjects. Even more, someone loudly calls for women to quickly return to the family, and not to seek any economic equality at all. On the surface, these are all men oppressing women, but thinking carefully, are these simply because of men's brutality and unreasonableness?</p>
<p>Some people also think that the reason why the women's movement has no results should be attributed to women themselves not being ambitious, marrying husbands, and like having a backer, locking themselves in the home and no longer thinking about any equality and liberation. But in fact, many wise women are truly wronged. Except for women without knowledge who have not been educated, perhaps willingly degenerate and do not seek to improve themselves, there is no knowledgeable woman who does not hope that she can engage in social work like her husband and all men. It is just that the trivial matters of the family do not allow them to leave home even a step. Many mistresses grumble: "Can we be a scholar in the cradle? Can we experiment with analytical chemistry on the stove? Should we mend our daughter's long gown first, or read Shakespeare's masterpieces first?" It is so difficult to study on your own at home, can you say that they voluntarily do not want to go to the crossroads?</p>
<p>These observations are all superficial mistakes. If you pursue it further, why do men want to lock women in the family? Why do women voluntarily give up fighting for equality? You can find a very obvious common point, which is because there is a family; for the trivial housework, men are forced, or women voluntarily stay in the family. The thing that makes housework so complicated are those children. A family with children cannot do without a housewife who pays attention at all times. Without children at home, everything is simple.</p>
<p>Therefore, if women want to obtain liberation, they must first seek equal economic status. If they want to seek equal economic status, they must first settle the little baby. Solving the problem of settling the little baby, and the nursery is a dedicated and specialized childcare institution, which can also reduce many small incidents in terms of the child, but small-scale, aristocratic, private nurseries are limited to manpower and material resources. The conditions for operation are definitely not enough to establish universally. This requires wise politicians to understand the importance of the childcare system and use the power of the government to set up universal nurseries for the people!</p>
<p>Please don't be happy for your personal success, wives who have found a job! You are on the wrong path, and instead of saying it is success, it is better to say it is a failure; although it cannot be determined that every one of you uses servants, maids, and big sisters for all the housework, there must be many who do, in this way, it is just enslaving others to make yourself happy, can it not make people feel chilled about the liberation movement?</p>

<p>Since the launch of the newspaper's fourth scholarship fund, inquiries from all walks of life have been received by letter and telegram yesterday in an endless stream. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Donations Can Be Notified by Telephone</p>
<p>Yesterday, donations were received from all sectors, totaling one thousand five hundred yuan. Among them, Hua Ji generously donated one thousand yuan, considering that it is difficult for poor students to study during this difficult time. (Detailed amounts are listed in the newspaper's social service section.) Considering that those who generously donate to scholarships may be too busy with public or private matters to come to the office in person, the newspaper has decided that, starting today, please notify the newspaper's scholarship staff of the amount of the donation at any time by telephone, and they will bring the official receipt to collect the money, in order to save you the trouble of trekking through the cold.</p>
<p>Applicants Should Come to the Office in Person</p>
<p>Since the newspaper published the announcement that scholarship applications would begin on the 15th, dozens of poor students from various schools have sent letters requesting registration forms every day. However, upon reviewing the application procedures, it is required to attach the previous semester's transcript or certificate of study. Simply requesting by letter is not serious enough. Therefore, students applying for scholarships should come to the office in person to receive the registration form and complete the registration in accordance with all the required procedures. All registration requests by letter will not be issued. Please pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Rebuttal of the U.S. White Paper by Information Minister Hirota</h3>
<p>The Japanese Embassy in this city invites the Chinese press corps of this city every Wednesday. Yesterday (the 13th) afternoon, it was held, and more than a dozen reporters from various newspapers attended. Information Minister Hirota, accompanied by Consul Fukama, attended on time. During the meeting, the Minister strictly refuted the exaggerated content of the white paper recently released by U.S. President Roosevelt. According to him, the white paper released by U.S. President Roosevelt this time includes the entire diplomatic situation of the United States for ten years from 1931 to 1941, and the conclusions are completely deceiving to the domestic people. To know that the formation of the Axis powers by Japan, Germany, and Italy is to build a true new world order, so the culprit for the outbreak of this war should be the United States and Britain who provoked it from the middle. This is very obvious proof. According to the content of the white paper, it is completely a dictatorial policy of Roosevelt, that is, a new doctrine of difficulty. We can estimate its original text, which is to expose the current situation of the United States as scattered and dreaming of gathering popular support to support this war. Since Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, the United States has suffered heavy losses in the major naval battles in the South Pacific, so it has created the atmosphere and made these pointless propaganda.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Authorities Return Factories: Shenxin No. 7 and Eight Others, Ceremony Scheduled for Today</h3>
<p>Allied News Agency, Shanghai: In order to promote the economic recovery of China, the Japanese military authorities have scheduled a ceremony in Shanghai today (Thursday) to return eight factories in Shanghai and Ningbo, such as Shenxin No. 7 Factory, to Chinese factory owners. To date, out of the 140 Chinese-owned factories managed by the Japanese military authorities, 104 have been returned. The remaining 36 will also be returned soon.</p>
<h3>Meeting of Japanese Consuls in Three Provinces Postponed</h3>
<p>The meeting of Japanese consuls in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, presided over by Minister Tianjiri of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, was originally scheduled to be held in Shanghai on the 11th of this month. It was planned to closely coordinate the consular offices under the jurisdiction of the embassy and instruct the future administrative policies of the consular offices in various places, and to consult on matters such as upgrading the consular offices. Due to various procedures and related matters not being completed in time, it has been postponed for about ten days, and will be convened again.</p>
<h3>Municipal Party Headquarters and Others Convene Meeting: Strengthening Belief in Participation in the War</h3>
<p>In order to awaken the public's understanding of the significance of participating in the war and strengthen their belief, the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters has scheduled a citywide party affairs meeting on the 18th of this month. It is heard that the central authorities will also send personnel to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Shaokui, director of the East Asia Economic Roundtable Conference's Central China headquarters, sent a respectful telegram to the chairman yesterday (the 13th) to express his sincere support for the National Government's policy of participating in the war.</p>
<p>The Global Overseas Chinese Federation held a conference yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the International Hotel to support the National Government's participation in the war to liberate overseas Chinese. A respectful telegram to the chairman was immediately decided upon.</p>
<h3>Clearance Area in Shanghai: Baojia Compilation Completed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Clearance Committee regards the Baojia system as the foundation of local autonomy and the main undertaking of the Clearance work. Therefore, after the start of the Shanghai Clearance, it immediately focused all its efforts on the compilation of Baojia and the investigation of household registration. Now the Baojia compilation and household registration investigation in each district have been fully completed separately. The Shanghai Clearance Committee's First Division has also strictly supervised and handled the registration of population changes and the management of new households. Therefore, petty thieves have disappeared in the Clearance area, and security has been established.</p>
<h3>The Self-Police Youth Department of Baojia Restates Its Purpose</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Self-Police Youth Department of Baojia in the Shanghai Public Concession, there have been many misunderstandings about the purpose of the department from the outside world, thinking that the department is an agency for the Concession to collect Ding money. In fact, the purpose has already been explained clearly, which is to gather outstanding youth from the city, give them moral, intellectual, physical, and group training, and then serve the society. It is purely an intelligent mass organization. This kind of organization is very common in countries around the world, but it is still the first time in this city, and it is a pilot project. During the department's previous selection, there were more than one thousand five hundred youths who took the exam, but only six hundred were admitted. The existing members of the department are not enough to share the work, so it is scheduled to conduct another selection in the middle of this month.</p>
<h3>Welcoming Director Shinoki</h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Business and Industry Association believes that Director Shinoki of the Bank of Japan's visit to various parts of our country to inspect the economic situation will make many contributions to the improvement of our country's economy. In order to express their welcome, they have specifically scheduled a welcome meeting for all directors at the Jinmen Hotel on the afternoon of the 15th of this month, and invited leaders from all financial and industrial circles to participate in the grand event.</p>
<h3>Louis Smoll Auction House Taken Over by Da Jiangnan Nanyang Company</h3>
<p>Louis Smoll Auction and Notary Company was originally operated by a British person. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, all British and American industries in China have become enemy property and have been taken over separately by the Japanese military authorities. Now Louis Smoll was also designated by the Japanese military authorities to be taken over and operated by Da Jiangnan Nanyang Company the other day, and to reorganize the internal affairs.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Open Basketball Tournament: Tongren Surprisingly Defeats Monocle; Xingren Leads the Pack in Recent Performance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Open Basketball Tournament was held at 7:00 PM last night (the 12th) at the YMCA gymnasium on Baxianqiao. In the Class A games, Tongren surprisingly defeated Monocle with a score of 25 to 24. Xingren also easily defeated the Italian Navy with a score of 41 to 10.

At the start of the contest, Monocle's Qian Na opened the scoring. Bo Tuo added icing on the cake and returned with credit. Tongren was slow to respond. In the first half, Monocle occupied an absolute advantage with a score of 14 to 3. In the second half, the situation changed dramatically. Monocle was negligent for a while, wasting opportunities. Tongren's Jiang Shuliang and Xuan Tong took advantage of the opportunity to counterattack, and they were indeed successful. The score rose rapidly. In the last two minutes, they reversed the defeat with a score of 25 to 24, thus laying the foundation for victory.</p>
<h3>Chinese-Western Amateur Boxing Match: Dong Zhenting Wins</h3>
<p>The Chinese-Western Amateur Boxing Match organized by the Chinese Youth Sports Department was held on the evening of the 9th at the YMCA gymnasium on Sichuan Road. The most exciting programs were Dong Zhenting vs. Ginsberg and Bo Tuo vs. Fei Zheng. The contest between Dong and Jin was particularly noteworthy. Dong was quick in his strikes, heavy in his punches, and exceptionally calm, so Ginsberg could not adopt an offensive strategy.</p>

<h3>Public Utility Stocks Are the Strongest; Hua Securities Stocks Already Have Buyers</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Hua stock market situation was stable and firm. However, new and old investors were not as active as the previous day. Although there is a possibility of rising in the future, it is feared that there will be a slight roundabout for the time being. Hua Electric of the public utility industry once rose from 40 yuan to 41 yuan and 25 cents. At noon, it was one yuan, father rose 5 cents. Zhabei Water and Electricity was stagnant at around 60 yuan and 06 cents. China Bookstore of the cultural industry was between 160 yuan and 65 yuan, up 2 yuan and a half. Business Bookstore had a buy at 445 yuan. World Bookstore was 106 yuan and 7 yuan and a half, the price of entry and exit, and rose one yuan. The National Goods Company of the department store industry rose from 75 yuan to 7 yuan. At noon, it was 6 yuan, up 1 yuan and a half. Yong'an was difficult to sell at 130 yuan. Xinxin rose to 140 yuan, then fell back to 38 yuan, both slightly lower. Yong'an Yarn Factory of the textile industry rose to 340 yuan. Dasheng No. 1 Factory had transactions at 380 yuan. Meiya Silk Factory opened new shares from 31 yuan and retreated to 29 yuan. Small denomination tickets Daguanming Weaving suddenly rose to 11 yuan and a half. Hongsheng and Dachina Weaving stocks were both flat. Nanyang Tobacco was around 120 yuan. Dachina Match was 325 yuan, both with little change. Only Wuzhou Pharmacy of the new pharmaceutical industry made a small five yuan, at 665 yuan. Xin Asia rose 5 cents to reach 24 yuan 75 cents. Minyi has been sucked up by a certain household and once lifted to 65 yuan, then 63 yuan, rebounding 3 yuan. China and West Pharmacy was 440 yuan. Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory was 250 yuan. Sino-French Pharmacy was 26 yuan and 75 cents, all of which were noon prices, and leveled out. China United Film saw a high price of 33 yuan, then 2 yuan, and then rose 1 yuan. The company was strongly pulling up. Hua Securities at 127 yuan and a half already had sellers. The rise and fall of other stocks were also small. Today's table is published in the newspaper.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Are Trending Upward, Slowly Rising</h3>
<p>The government bond market is gradually becoming firmer. One reason is that the silver roots of each gang have been leveled, and the Joint Reserve Association of Banks and the Joint Reserve Association of Money Shops have cooperated in lending government securities to fellow villagers, allowing a 30% discount. People's hearts have therefore changed from the previous turbulence to stability. Therefore, the goods that have been sold out gradually had buybacks, and the price rose slowly. Class C rose from 49 yuan and 20 cents to 50 yuan and 08 cents, and finally there were still 056 cents. Class A was 50 yuan with change. Class B was 9 yuan and 50 cents. Class D was 8 yuan and 12 cents. Class E was 8 yuan 50 cents to 70 cents. The trend and people's hearts have changed, and there is still a possibility of continuing to improve, at least returning to above 50 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grain Transactions Are Quiet</h3>
<p>Bean Industry Applies for More Soybeans</p>
<p>Yesterday's grain market situation, beans and other types of products lacked transactions due to movement restrictions. Only bean cakes rose slightly from 12 yuan and a half to 92 yuan and 7 corners. Three cars of Fei-character bean cakes were priced at 92 yuan and a half to 93 yuan and 7 corners. 500 pieces of Changji bean cake were priced at 91 yuan and 7 corners.</p>
<p>Also, yesterday, the Grain Group began to distribute broad beans, selling them at 46 yuan and a half per dan (unit of weight), distributing more than 1,500 bags to retail stores throughout the city throughout the day.</p>
<p>Recently, in order to adjust people's food, the authorities have implemented a ban on the movement of food, resulting in the disappearance of black markets for soybeans and other products. The tofu industry in this city, because the Grain Group's distribution of goods is nowhere in sight, and the black market is cut off, is about to be forced to close down completely. Emergency meetings have been held for days, but there has been no proper solution. Yesterday, they sent letters to the Works Department's Materials Control Council and the Military Distribution Authority, listing the difficulties and requesting relief. It is said that there are 320 companies in the industry throughout the city. Each company needs at least 24 bags of beans, requiring approximately 7,680 bags per month, equivalent to 153,600 city pounds. But since September, the number received by the industry has been far from enough, then in the future, thousands of workers will be at risk of unemployment, and at the same time, it will also have a significant impact on the lives of civilians.</p>
<h3>Every Liang (Unit of Weight) of Gold Can Not Exceed 3,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai: The authorities have set the price limit for gold at 3,000 yuan per liang and will strictly enforce it without exceeding it, and will send personnel to gold shops and Dasing Bank to closely monitor and absolutely prohibit price increases. The rise and fall of gold has a significant impact on the entire financial industry, and even all industries and all goods. The goldsmith industry and Dasing Bank had previously (the 12th) posted a price of 3,050 yuan per liang. After being found out by the authorities, they were immediately ordered to post a small price to settle the situation at the 3,000 yuan mark.</p>
<h3>Joint Banknotes Are Down Slightly by 2 Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the interbank lending rate of the Money Shops Association was still posted at 1 point and 7 cents.</p>
<p>The Japanese military ticket rose to 5 yuan 5 corners and 5 cents 4 li (unit of currency) among fellow traders, and soon fell back to 13 li. Small money houses and bank outlets were priced at 5 yuan 5 corners and 4 and a half cents and 5 and a half cents for entry and exit. Joint banknote dealers sold at 3 yuan 7 corners and a half and collected at 3 yuan 7 corners, down slightly by 2 cents.</p>
<h3>Fujian Lu Sun Dried Bamboo Shoots Arrive More, Market Loosens</h3>
<p>Fujian Lu sun dried bamboo shoots, recently due to more arrivals, market prices have repeatedly weakened. Yesterday, there was a batch of goods, the identity and quality were commendable, but the extra costs were high and the cost was not low, but the traders' asking price was harsh. Soon, the deal was pulled off at 1,160 yuan, and all the money was opened up, totaling more than 300 pieces.</p>
<h3>Hardware Market Is Quite Quiet; Few Industrial Raw Materials Are Traded</h3>
<p>The hardware market is quite quiet due to the impact of sluggish sales in all directions. The biggest reason is that the varieties of hardware products in Shanghai are incomplete, and buyers have a sigh of wanting but not being able to get them. In addition, the visiting traders' sales are sluggish, and factories in this street and other places have limited sales of their products, so it is difficult to see enthusiasm in the collection of raw materials. Therefore, the entire market atmosphere is extraordinarily quiet, but the hearts of those holding goods are high and low. Due to sluggish transactions and tight silver roots, some are willing to sell at low prices, but some are reluctant to let go easily due to the idea that their inventory is weak. Therefore, it is difficult for the market to have a fixed standard. However, most still call for the limited price. It is also a fact that the varieties of each goods are lacking and it is difficult to search for them.</p>
<p>Industrial raw materials, with very thin inventory, transactions are quiet, and there is no official market. Slightly traded ones are priced at any time. The market prices are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Moon Brand Small Baking Soda 50 Buckets 1,200 yuan</p>
<p>Kilogram Bag 1,200 yuan</p>
<p>East Goods Bleaching Powder Essence 3,600 yuan</p>
<p>Italy's Ideng You Club 4,000 yuan</p>
<p>American Bleaching Powder Pound 17 yuan</p>
<p>Tung Oil Dan (unit of weight) 2,500 yuan</p>
<p>Butter Dan 2,400 yuan</p>
<p>Belgian White Oil Pound 23 yuan</p>
<p>M Rosin Bucket Dan 950 yuan</p>
<p>This Bucket 880 yuan</p>
<p>Mobil Van Huang Pound 9 yuan and 5 corners</p>
<p>Shilin White Pound 24 yuan</p>
<p>Borax Bag 1,600 yuan</p>
<p>Callery Resin Ton 3,200 yuan</p>
<p>(Note) The club is equal to one hundred and twelve pounds</p>
<h3>Ri Xin Tai Did Not Purchase Red or Green Tea Stalks</h3>
<p>We have received a letter from the Ri Xin Tai Tea Company stating: "We recently read in the thirteenth-day commercial news of your newspaper that Ri Xin Tai Tea Company purchased four loads of green tea stalks from Tong Feng Tea Firm at a price of two hundred yuan per load, and also purchased five boxes of black tea at a price of five hundred and seventy yuan per load. This is inconsistent with the facts. Our company has not purchased any recently. We believe this is a misunderstanding of information. We hope you will correct this."</p>
<h3>Strengthening the Transportation Capacity of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere: Java Builds Large Wooden Ships</h3>
<p>The first Japanese wooden ship, bearing the important task of exchanging materials within the Southern Co-Prosperity Sphere, has recently appeared as a New Year's gift, adding new power to the transportation fleet.</p>
<p>For the purpose of establishing a self-sufficiency policy in shipbuilding, the Japanese military administration has focused on the inexhaustible forest resources of the island and has long been carrying out plans to build large wooden ships. Recently, the hull of one of these ships has been completed. A grand launching ceremony was held at the 〇〇 shipyard, attended by Military Administrator Okazaki and other relevant officials. In the past, Java had only built small ships for coastal use, with a capacity of only twenty or thirty tons, and at most one hundred tons. The large ship built this time is truly the first of its kind in Java and is worthy of attention.</p>
<p>The entire hull is made of Malit wood, which is highly water-resistant, has strong durability, and excellent wave-piercing performance. Its performance is no less than that of ordinary steamers, and it is truly an absolutely excellent wooden ship unparalleled in the world.</p>
<p>The keel of the ship was laid on October 20th of last year, and it was launched in just seventy days. This was the result of the unyielding efforts of the Japanese guidance team under the command of factory director Zao Teng during construction, and the tireless cooperation of the Malay shipwrights who were aware of the great principles of co-prosperity. Such a shipbuilding speed can be said to be record-breaking, even compared to well-equipped shipyards in mainland Japan. The ship is currently being decorated and is scheduled to make its solemn maiden voyage in early February. In the future, the second and third ships will be built successively and will sail between the southern islands and the mainland as trade ships in the south, becoming the main artery connecting the island nations of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Moreover, it will travel far across the ocean to transport the special products of the South to mainland Japan, so its future activity is highly anticipated.</p>

<h3>Reminded of Su Qin</h3>
<p>— Jia Xinsheng</p>
<p>Both the "Intrigues of the Warring States" and the "Records of the Grand Historian" contain accounts of Su Qin. Although the wording differs slightly, the content is similar.</p>
<p>When Su Qin presented his ten proposals to the King of Qin, but they were not adopted, and he returned home in disgrace, the "Intrigues of the Warring States" describes it this way:</p>
<p>"...worn-out shoes, carrying books and a bag, his appearance withered, his face dark, and his expression ashamed. When he returned home, his wife did not come down from her loom, his sister-in-law did not cook for him, and his parents did not speak to him. Su Qin sighed and said, 'My wife does not regard me as her husband, my sister-in-law does not regard me as her brother-in-law, and my parents do not regard me as their son. This is all the fault of Qin!'"</p>
<p>Later, Su Qin studied hard, persuaded the King of Zhao with his great merit, and received the seal of the prime minister, becoming greatly successful. The "Intrigues of the Warring States" describes it this way:</p>
<p>"...When he was about to persuade the King of Chu, he passed through Luoyang. His parents heard of it, cleared the palace, cleaned the road, set up music and drinks, and welcomed him thirty li outside the city. His wife glanced at him sideways and listened intently. His sister-in-law crawled on her hands and knees, kowtowed four times, and apologized on her knees. Su Qin said, 'Why were you so arrogant before and so respectful now?' His sister-in-law said, 'Because of your honorable position and great wealth.' Su Qin said, 'Alas! In poor families, parents do not regard their sons as sons, but in rich and noble families, relatives are afraid and respectful. In this world, can power, position, and wealth be ignored?'"</p>
<p>Su Qin's character has long been determined in history, and we need not overturn it. We find these two passages to be wonderfully contrasted: Sima Qian, seeing such wonderful writing in the "Intrigues of the Warring States," certainly would not let it go lightly, using it to vent his grievances and express his dissatisfaction. The author of the "Intrigues of the Warring States" can also be said to be using the subject to develop his own ideas, expressing his own feelings with vivid details. Furthermore, the reason why this passage can be recited to this day, and why everyone can "feel something in their hearts" and "applaud with admiration" after reading it, is because our society and human nature are not so different from Su Qin's time!</p>
<p>General people who are concerned about the world often lament, saying that "people's hearts are not as they used to be." Su Qin and his wife and sister-in-law can certainly be considered people of the past. However, these ancient hearts are not necessarily much wiser than those of today!</p>
<p>Su Qin and his wife and sister-in-law's bodies have long since decayed. However, people of this type continue to exist in every generation. Therefore, "who says that people of ancient and modern times are not related to each other?"</p>
<h3>Thoughts After Seeing "The Man of Lu"</h3>
<p>— Mangci</p>
<p>Zeng Mengpu's "The Man of Lu" is a romance novel of joys and sorrows that was popular in the early years of the Republic of China, but reading it today, one cannot help but laugh at its childishness and staleness. The advertisement praises it as "comparable to 'Dream of the Red Chamber' and far superior to 'Romance of the West Chamber.'" This is why the advertisement is an advertisement. Many characters in "Dream of the Red Chamber" are still vivid in our minds, but who remembers "The Man of Lu" now? Mr. Luo Ming said in the preface: "The Man of Lu has made the deepest impression on me. Sometimes I feel like I am the Man of Lu." I am afraid that only Mr. Luo Ming would say such a thing now! Indeed, "The Man of Lu" once broke publishing records at the time. If we judge its merits based on the number of copies sold, we might as well say that it is a "masterpiece." But if "The Man of Lu" has the value of being adapted for performance, then "Guangling Tide," "Nineteen Turtle"... etc., could also be adapted for performance, right?</p>
<p>As mentioned above, "The Man of Lu" is a so-called "new novel" in the early years of the Republic of China, which was a "small-footed enlargement" of Western European new literature. Unexpectedly, Mr. Luo Ming is 100% "faithful" to the original, preserving the original dialogues, characters, and plots... intact. If this decision to perform it still has any value, it is to treat it as a cute photo of our childhood and laugh at it. The dialogues are completely in the style of "laughing on stage." Phrases like "My beloved brother!" and "My good sister!" are considered interesting when they are actually disgusting.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of strict modern drama, "The Man of Lu" lacks foreshadowing and climax in terms of drama. In the beginning, it focuses on the Man of Lu, but later the Man of Lu is not mentioned, and the focus shifts to the "secondary theme" of Sun Jinglu. That is to say, the "main theme" and the "secondary theme" do not develop in an intertwined manner, and the beginning and end cannot echo each other. The plot is plain and simple, completely in the style of narrating a story. Even the story is narrated clumsily. To illustrate this, in the second scene of the second act, the Man of Lu lies in a pavilion after being heartbroken and dreams. The lights go out, and it turns into a gloomy underworld. The judge asks him why he is so heartless. He cries out for justice. At the crucial moment, the lights go out again, and it returns to the original pavilion. The Man of Lu is still crying out for justice. There is no audience member who does not laugh at this point. What kind of play is this? In addition, the Man of Lu falls and bleeds from his face, Zhu Xiaoxiong is bitten by a poisonous snake while climbing a tree... The jokes are endless. In any art, the key is to "touch lightly and strike heavily," but after reading Mr. Luo Ming's work, it makes people feel that the playwright is exerting all his strength, but the audience is still "completely confused."</p>
<p>Speaking of the director, many scenes adopt the "two-two exchange system" (pardon my invention of this term). This means that two actors stand in the center of the stage, one on the left and one on the right. After standing for too long, the one on the right switches to the left, and the one on the left switches to the right. That's all.</p>
<p>As for acting, Sun Jinglu is still worth seeing, and the scene at the end of her life is the most moving. The cold mountain's Man of Lu is dull and stupid, with no handsome scholar's air. Wu Jingping is fairly competent. Li Li's recitation of lines is always her consistent mournful tone, with little variation. Ma Xiaonong, Shamo, and Fei Yin all have actions that are too modern and do not harmonize with the script. Wu Chunzhen's performances always give people something to laugh about. Her speech is already strange, and sometimes she adds twitches of her nose and distortions of her mouth, which does not seem very elegant.</p>
<h3>Starting from "With Eyes and Without Eyes"</h3>
<p>— Shield</p>
<p>"With Eyes and Without Eyes." This is a so-called "fairy tale," that is, a small book written specifically for children to read. More than thirty years ago, Mr. Sun Yuxiu of Wuxi translated it into Chinese and published it in Shanghai. He introduced Western fairy tales not because he still had a childlike heart, but because he saw that this kind of work was really needed. He translated twenty-three kinds of fairy tales, among which there were about seven or eight kinds belonging to the "With Eyes and Without Eyes" category. It is said that the most popular and well-received ones were still fantasy fairy tales such as "Little Thumb" and "The Country Without Cats."</p>
<p>This matter does not seem strange, but it can also be exaggerated a bit, saying that it can "reveal a major significance," such as tracing its source to "the Chinese people's lack of scientific minds." Because the little book "With Eyes and Without Eyes" is a reading material with common sense of natural science as its content. I don't believe the saying that "the Chinese people lack scientific minds." Didn't many basic principles of science first come from China? However, "China lacks scientific education" is a fact.</p>
<p>Gentlemen who like to read "fairy tale literature" will not think highly of "With Eyes and Without Eyes." Because this is not a work by Andersen or the Brothers Grimm. But it seems that we should not have this prejudice. Although child psychologists explain the development of child psychology from a scientific standpoint, it must first go through the "barbaric stage" and the "primitive human stage." However, if we think that we must tell ghost stories because of this! It is necessary for the Nine Heavens Fairy to marry a winter melon in order to satisfy the curiosity and fantasy desires of the little savage children. That may not seem to be in line with science. There are indeed many bizarre and fantastic things in the oral literature of every nation, and they have always been used as the initial "spiritual food" for young children. However, it seems that they should also be regarded as "the remnants of barbarism" and given the epithet "not in line with educational principles."</p>
<p>These words may be shooting arrows at random, because at present we don't even seem to have "Little Thumb" and "The Country Without Cats." Children here start to ________ their parents as soon as their teeth grow, however, precisely because of this, a good garden has been left for people who care about children's reading to try their hand.</p>
<p>"With Eyes and Without Eyes" should also be classified into the outdated team today! Although the method of this small book is correct, and it was an early predecessor of this type of children's reading education, it is inevitable that the material will be a bit outdated. Because in the past eighty years, the progress of biology has already made some rather historical theories of botany and zoology have to be revised. In particular, the great contribution of the Curies has caused all departments of natural science to raise new questions and add new "hypotheses." Therefore, what was "with eyes" in the past may now be "without eyes." It may not be a pity that it does not remain in the book forest. Fortunately, there are new eyes; even bigger eyes, are already near us.</p>
<p>At this time of great difficulties, it can be said to be pedantic to talk about this "non-urgent matter," but we believe that scientific knowledge is the most basic of all knowledge, especially for children. (Remuneration transferred to poverty relief fund)</p>
<h3>The Model Teacher of All Ages</h3>
<p>— Written by James Hilton, translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>She first liked him because he was so attentive and wanted to know everything, because he had a gentle and quiet demeanor, because his views came from so far away, far away from the absolutely impossible seventies, eighties, and even further - but all this did not count, he was so honest; and because - because his eyes were brown, and his face was moving when he smiled. "Of course, I'm also going to call you Chips," she said, knowing that this was his nickname at school.</p>
<p>Within a week, they had completely fallen in love; before Chips was able to walk without a cane, they thought they were engaged; a week before the fall term began, they were married in London.</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>Chips dreamed for hours and hours in Mrs. Wiggat's house, recalling those days, at which time he would always look down at his feet, not quite sure which foot had done him such an extraordinary service. This was the small cause of many major accidents, and he could not remember all the details. But he saw again the overlapping peaks of Great Gable (from which he had never visited the Lake District again), the mouse-grey depths of Wastwater beneath the Screes; he could smell again the washed-out air after the heavy rain, and follow the edge of the mountain path again to Sty Head. That dizzyingly happy time, the evening walks by the water, her clear voice and joyful laughter, were so clearly etched in his mind. She really was, often was, a very happy person.</p>
<p>They both planned their future life together so enthusiastically; but he could not help but take this matter somewhat seriously, even with some fear. Of course, it was very good for her to come to Brookfield; the other housemasters were already married. She had also told him that she liked children and would live a good life among them. "Oh, Chips, you are just the way you are, I am so glad. I was afraid you were a lawyer, or a stockbroker, or a dentist, or a businessman with a huge cotton business in Manchester. That's what I mean when I first decided to meet you. School teachers are very different, very important, don't you think, those children are growing up, and are related to the world, and now they have to be guided..." (11)</p>
<h3>Art Scene</h3>
<p>— Lilai</p>
<p>After the Jin Cheng Grand Theater was converted to perform Peking Opera, the Jin Du Grand Theater will also be converted to perform spoken drama. The "Golden Voice" Zhou Xuan, who has been in retirement for a long time, will also meet us on stage.</p>
<p>Li Pingqian's new work "Peach and Plum Compete for Spring" is said to be an adaptation of Bette Davis's "The Old Maid" and will be staged during the lunar New Year.</p>
<p>Shangguan Yunzhu, Han Fei, He Bin and others from the Shanghai Film Artists Troupe have toured North China and Northeast China. According to He Bin's letter to friends in Shanghai, they may return to Shanghai in the spring.</p>
<p>Ding Zhilu and Shan once left "Shanghai Art" and there was news that Shan had joined China United Film Company. Now it is known that both of them have returned.</p>
<p>In Tong Zhiling's "Spinning Cotton," there is a spoken drama performance at the end. A cry of "Oh my god" sounds exactly like Tang Ruoqing's tone. I don't know who designed it.</p>
<p>Li Jianwu's "Clouds of Xia" has been adapted into a movie, starring Wang Xichun, and renamed "A Generation of Famous Actresses."</p>
<p>The knowledgeable young amateur actor Chen Da　 traveled from Shanghai to Peiping last month and was warmly received by celebrities and amateur actors in the old capital. Mr. Chen's conversation is elegant and he has the true nature of a scholar. Also, the famous Pingju critic Fan Shiren has also arrived in Peiping.</p>

<h3>Speedily Relief for Refugees</h3>
<p>— Chun Gao</p>
<p>The weather has been so cold lately, and things are so expensive. The temperature has dropped below freezing point, and water freezes as soon as it drips. The poor people on the streets are suffering from hunger and cold, especially the poor children who have frozen to death. How pitiful this is! Now I am giving the five jiao from the scholarship I received from Gu Bo Primary School last semester, and I have asked my father to give me four yuan and five jiao, for a total of five yuan, and sending it to your newspaper's poverty relief fund. I hope everyone will donate generously with compassion and quickly relieve those compatriots who are hungry and waiting for food.</p>
