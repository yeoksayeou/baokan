<p>社評</p>
<h3>歡迎友邦「中國經濟考察團」</h3>
<p>日本東亞經濟　談會所組織之「中國經濟考察團」，已於昨日抵滬。該團考察使命，前已由團長小倉氏等本月三日在東京加以說明，其主旨爲「與中國財界巨頭，及國府方面，對兩國經濟提携作具體懇談，充分接受中國人士之意見，不僅採取團體行動，並擬作私人月靈談，瓷缸意見。對於中國經濟問題，如物價·金融·貿易及糧食等，均應作充分研究之問題，期對兩國產業經濟之共存共榮，有所裨益。　我們對於該團能於團體行動之外，多作私人懇談，交換意見，而充分接受中國人士之意見各點，認爲是該團　察使命的特色，也可以說是該團能適應時代環境的地方；同時，我們更可以預言，　團將來　成功，必定是得力於這些特色。我們願以中國人民的地位，率先提供意見數點，以貢獻於團員諸君，俾於中國當前經濟問題，有一個輪廓的認識。</p>
<p>（一）物價問題　年來中國人民最感痛苦的，莫過於物價高漲，生活重壓。形成物價高漲的因素很多，若干點固然是戰時現象中不可避免的，如物資减少等，也是各國共通的。但是，若干點是中國所獨有的，如大囤積等；若干點是中國比較別國程度嚴重的，如貨幣　買力减低，交通運輸不暢等。物價高漲的速度，必定使友邦人士引爲　奇。中國人民也懂得戰時生活刻苦是分內的事，物價高漲是必需是現象，可是超過刻苦而成爲痛苦，不僅高漲而成爲飛漲，畢竟是忍受不了的。這是一。</p>
<p>（二）糧食問題　糧食即是民食，民食是民生問題中最主要的一種。我們坦白的說，中國人民中最大多　的農民，一般的觀念，人生爲的是「食」，全部生命寄託於「食」上面，所以，不談安定民生則已，談到安定民生，說非把民食問題解决不可。中國農民一向重視現實，而最不慣聽中號，尤其是嘴巴裏說「天」而做出來的事實是「地」。這是中國人民引爲最失信譽，最不痛快的事。民食問題更其如此。這是二。</p>
<p>（三）增加生產問題　增加生產，就是增益物資，物資　豐富，對外足以增强總車戰，從速完遂大東亞戰爭；對內足以平抑物價，减少人民生活重壓。早經國民政府在戰時經濟政策綱領中明確規定。我們認爲實施方面幷未能全力以上。即以上海區域的工業而言，不但未曾增產，且有减少產量的，其原因如電力限制，原料無着，運輸難等等。我們希望政策的決定與事實的履行，完全表裏一致。一方面盛言增加生產，而一方面却不高法消除陰礙生產的原因。甚至無意地戰成阻礙生產的原因，這種種都應該注意矯正的。這是三。</p>
<p>（四）物資交流問題　華中華北華南的和平區域之聞，物資交流，各以所餘，以易所無，這與物價問題民生問題，都有非常重要的關係。在實施交流時，最感切要的就是運輸　限制的問題，我們認爲物資交流，其重要性並不亞於其他經濟問題，值得重視面設法盡量疏暢。這是四。</p>
<p>（五）貨幣問題　通貨與一切經濟以及人民日常生活發生密切關係，其重要性不待解說。目前中儲　　華中華南唯一通貨，基　堅穩，凖備充實，固已　政府當局所屢屢聲明者，惟是　買力的一再低落，無論在國家財源以及人民信仰，均爲必須講求之道。這是五。</p>
<p>最後，我們對於中日經濟提携，在平　互惠原則下，竭誠期待加緊强化。老實說，依照目前的事實環境，中國經濟問題，如果得不到日本的充分協助，是不可能收獲調整　利的效果。換言之，一切經濟問題，中國本身自當極力振奪，同時，友邦也必須積極的澈底的幫助。譬如今年三月，友邦以華中經濟統制權交還中國，即予中國人士以良好印象。我們雖則辦得並不如預期的順利，不過這是人事問題，我們當然　圖調整；同時，盼望友邦當局的進一步熱烈的策勵與指正，以期底於成功。我們絕對的接受友邦熱意的贊助與指示，同時，我們也期待友邦聽取我們大多人民的意見與建議，惟有如此推誠相與，才可以取得濟上真正的提携。同時，友邦必須以改善中國經濟問題，爲中日協力最主要之對象，否則是爲協力過　中之累贅。</p>
<p>上面所說的，是我們報吿自己的病狀，當然是直覺的，倒是真切的，我們需求高明的醫生考慮我們所述的病狀，再加以各部分的診察，然後運用他的高超的學識和豐富的經騐，予以正確的診斷與對診的藥劑，使病者服了，當然痊愈。這一位高明的醫生是誰呢？就是已經蒞華友邦日本的「中國經濟考察團」，我們很幸運的在病中得到這位高明醫生的蒞臨，我們的病相信必能因此　然。在這樣的情緒之下，謹以萬分至誠歡迎友邦考察團諸君，並祝前途順利，身體健康！</p>

<h3>一年間中國方面　日軍作戰槪况</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　蘆溝橋事變發生迄今，瞬已六載。日大水營當茲六周年紀念日，特於六日發表自去年七月以來之一年間日軍在中國方面所獲之綜合戰果，計渝軍遺屍約四五七八〇〇，被俘約一四九〇〇〇，投誠者約九六〇〇〇，且於最近期一間，各戰綫渝軍之被俘及投誠者，遠較陣亡者爲多。如以比例言之，定其遣一屍數爲一百，則其前年度之俘虜數當爲四五，去年度則增至六七，及至本年度內，渝軍之被俘及投誠數，已超過其遺屍數而成一〇〇對一三八之比，又渝方將領幹部參加和運者，最近復紛至沓來，其中最著者如華北方面渝蔣唯一直系部隊第廿四集團軍軍長厭炳動將軍，於最近率部七萬參加和運，足證渝軍之抗戰意識，已日益低下。及至國府參戰，日政府對中國採取新政策後，渝方之抗戰意義，因而完全喪失。同時日本爲謀中華民族之發展之眞意，刻已漸次深刻滲入於渝方之內部，茲將過去一年問日軍與中國各次作戰之意義，及所獲戰果分誌於次：（一）浙贛作戰，（自民國三十一年五月中旬至同年九月中旬止華中之渝第三戰區）日軍爲期覆滅英美兩國在中國大陸東南部所恃爲結成第二戰雜之唯一據點，展開此次作戰，其規模稍次於武漢攻略作戰。渝（第三戰區）崩潰後，其反攻企圖，自亦悉吿粉碎，是役所獲戰果，計湔軍棄　約四二〇〇〇，被俘約一一〇〇，（二）從化作戰，（自民國三十一年五月下旬至同年九月上旬止華南之渝第七戰區）爲呼應華中浙贛作戰，乃對渝（第七戰區）展開此次作戰，因日軍先發制人、故予渝軍以重創。（三）第二次平北肅淸作戰，（自民國三十一年七月初旬至三卞一年九月中旬於華北平北地區（日軍爲期徹底剿減在平北一帶山岳地區盤據之共匪與滿洲國軍協力下而開始此次作戰，結果予渝軍以極大打擊。（四）太行山南部作戰，（自民國三十一年六月中旬迄三十一年七月下旬於華北）此乃繼續晋冀省境作戰之第三期作戰，以渝（第二十一軍）及（第二十四軍）集團軍之一部爲目標，在嶮峻之太行山脈中，展開此次作戰，結果將渝軍徹底覆滅。（五）第二次魯中作戰（自民國三十一年八月中旬迄三十一年九月初旬在華北山東省）八月初旬以來，山東干學忠軍內部即發生兵變，日軍爲將之殲滅，乃展開此次作戰，由於巧妙戰術，收獲赫赫戰果，是役渝軍棄屍三〇〇〇具，被俘一〇〇〇人。（六）東手湖西方地區肅淸作戰，（自民國三十一年九月下旬迄三十一年十月初旬於華北）日軍爲徹底撈減　西舊黃灑附近殘喘之共軍，乃構成嚴密之包圍網，逐次壓縮，予以大打擊，共軍棄屍一三〇〇具，被俘一三〇〇人。（七）秋季肅淸作戰，（自民國三十一年十月下旬迄三十一年十一月下旬於華北山西省）爲覆滅盤據於太行山南部之共軍而開始此次作戰，更擴大戰果及於山西省全域，實行徹底之肅淸戰。（八）蘇淮作戰，（自民國三十二年二月中旬迄三十二年三月中旬在華中江蘇省）對盤據於江蘇省蘇淮地區之渝（第八十九軍）及共軍（新四軍）在國府軍協力下，將其根據地覆滅，封鎖渝方對日軍佔據地內之策動，渝共軍共棄屍一八〇〇具，設俘七〇〇〇人。（九）江北殲滅作戰，（自民國三十二年二月初旬迄三十二年三月末於華中湖北省）於洞庭湖北方地區，圍剿渝（江北挺進軍）及（第一一八師）與王勁哉軍，將其殲滅、該地區治安已吿恢復，是役渝軍棄屍八六〇〇具，被俘約二三二〇〇人。（十）太行春季作戰（自民國三十二年四月中旬迄三十二年五月末在華北山西河南兩省，對蟠据於山西河南省境之渝第二十四集團軍及在山西察哈爾河北省境蠢動中之共軍，開始猛攻，將冀察戰區渝共軍勢力完全肅淸，渝二十四專團軍總司令龐炳勳及新編第五軍長孫殷英等參加和運，予渝方極大打擊，渝軍棄屍一一五〇〇具，被俘及投誠者七五〇〇〇人。（十）（一）江南進攻作戰，（自民國三十二年五月初迄三十二年六月中旬在華中中洞庭湖北方及宜昌對岸地區）對蠢動於渝方穀倉地帶洞庭湖北岸地區之渝（第二十九第十兩集團軍，）實行奇襲戰。連續奪取渝要衝，終於將湖南穀倉佔領，歸於國府統治，是役渝軍棄屍四五七〇〇具，被俘的六四〇〇人。中國日本派遣軍於此期間作戰逸十一次之多，其中於蘇淮作戰，渝軍被俘者之　爲凍屍數之三倍弱。於江北殲滅作戰爲二倍半弱，太行山春季作戰則爲六倍半弱，此足證渝方抗戰力已顯著低下。</p>
<h3>中國駐日大使蔡培　向國內作廣播　介紹戰時體制下之日本</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　中國駐日大使蔡培氏，於六日下午三時，假此間中央廣播電台，以介紹戰時體制下之日本爲題，向中國國內同胞發表廣播，列舉戰時下日本國民生活的合理化，國民本位的有認機及努力增　與日本靑少年訓練狀况等四點，最後並指出中日國今後同仇敵愾，殺敵致果之決意。</p>
<h3>旅泰華僑闡明　決與日本協力</h3>
<p>盤谷七日中央社電　盤谷中華總商會及旅泰華僑各團體等，以七七事變爆發迄今，業巳六年，特於七日發表告同胞書、表明協立大東亞戰爭之決意。茲誌其大意如次。囘顧自民國廿六年以來。蔣介石受英美操縱，與共黨結合，使四億中華人民，飽受塗炭之苦，迄已六年於茲，今則因友邦日本，已一掃東亞之英美勢力，而渝方亦已被迫侷處重慶。日趨沒落。中國幸在在主席領導下，正努力推進建設，且國府之向英美宣戰，更予渝方將士以極大刺激，相繼擁護國府，又關於恢復中國主權，前已於中日條約中，確認本年一月九日，國府參戰之時，日方又決定交還在中國各專管親界，並撤廢治外法權，及其他特權等，並即着着實行，吾等爲東亞民族將來之繁榮、今後必須更充實實力，向打倒英美之最終目的邁進，吾等旅泰華僑，爲獲得勝利，爲建設大東亞共榮圈，決盡其最大之努力云。</p>

<p>馬尼拉七日中央社電　菲島華僑協會，以七日爲中日事變六週紀念日，故特以全菲華僑之總意，通電渝方，促其反省，茲錄共電文大意如次，蘆溝橋事變發生，迄已六載，其間渝方始終期望英美援助，以抗日本，然事實所謂英美之援助、日趨减少，而抗戰區之團營則日益加甚，徒使無辜民衆，慘遭機牲，而無補於國家民族，今日本自實施對中國新政策後，百餘年來東縛中國之不平等條約，已得相繼取消，在中國之各國租界，亦已先後收囘、凡此事實。皆可證明日水與中國已眞誠合作，緊密提携，互爲東亞民族之解放與東亞共榮團之建設而協力，由此而觀，渝方實已喪失其抗戰之意義，至於抗戰之目標之消滅，亦更不待言，吾等旅菲十萬華僑，深望抗戰地區之同胞諸君，迅速停止此毫無意義之抗戰，起而參加建設新東亞之工作，蓋惟使大東亞共榮圈之早日實現，始爲吾人至上之使命云。</p>

<h3>糧部勸導民衆　節省米穀多用雜糧　充實儲糧適應戰時體制</h3>
<p>南京七日中央社電　糧食部鑒於吾國來穀產量衡諸過去需共狀况，向感不足，近來和平區城人口激增，米穀之消費更鉅。揆其原因巾於國人多狃於南人食米之習慣，致其餘農產物如麥苣苞米高粱番薯等、各地每年雖有大宗出產，除一部份平民以爲主要食糧外大都以之充作副食品，屬諸消耗者居多，與戰時節約原則，殊不相宣。今茲大東亞戰爭正在進行時期，我政府協力參　，對於民食之安定，軍需之確保，責任綦　，必需有充分之食糧，長期儲備，始克有濟。査食糧之儲藏，以米穀爲最富持久性，宜於收儲，故食米節約，尤爲當務之急。致以雜糧爲主要食品，即所以節約米穀，米榖之消費减低，即國家之儲糧增多，所望全體國民移轉觀念，今後兼以雜糧爲代用食糧。節省米榖之消耗，此項主張　已由該部咨請各省市政府及全國商業統制總會迅予佈吿民衆，剴切勸導。至近時各地雜糧價格或有越過米價趨勢，並請設法　以限制，仍保持與米價一與點七之比例，俾資獎誘。</p>
<h3>貝爾哥洛特地區　德攻勢有進展</h3>
<p>斯德哥爾摩七日中央社電　據此問昨晚所獲消息、蘇聯總指揮部錐稱德軍發動攻勢，並承認德軍在貝爾哥洛特方面之若干地方，稍有進展，惟昨晚柏林軍界人士，則謂反軸心國所傳德軍在奧萊爾，庫斯克，及貝爾哥洛特採取攻勢之說，悉屬無稽，並稱反軸心方面所稱，此次德軍發動之目標，係在佔領莫斯科云云，亦係一種宣傳策略，蓋可於德軍不實行此項計劃時，即可揚言其失敗也。至於英方所傳德方損折坦克車數百輛之說，則更絕對爲造謠矣。據海通社軍事訪員宜稱，目前庫斯克之戰事，係由於蘇軍，深感其陣綫突出不利，遲早間總將引起德方之攻擊，故欲先發制人耳。中段前綫之蘇軍司令官。對於上週末德軍之局部衝攻，似屬誤解其用意，認爲係德軍對庫斯克之大規模攻勢，並以爲欲使庫斯克之突出點，免遭切斷，唯有自動採取攻勢之一法，因此誤會之結果，遂自星期一日起，以貝爾哥洛特與奥萊爾之南爲中心，發動戰事，此項情形、正與去年五月相同，亦係蘇軍進攻，當時丁莫森柯元帥，欲在南段前綫，着德軍攻勢之先鞭，故以春問由伊齊永區域調集之衝鋒部隊，大舉進攻，同時更在卡柯夫以北。採取攻勢，以爲聲援，其目的在包圍卡柯夫之德軍，並突破尼伯河之一綫。丁氏以重大代價而所獲有限，旋即證明此爲其最大軍略上失敗之開端，蓋德軍嚴密包圍其先頭部隊，致蘇軍南戰綫之衝鋒部隊，全部覆沒，自本年五月以來，德方偵察所得，發見蘇軍不斷集中於庫斯克成一半圓形，該方面突出點之弦部，計長約二百六十公里，南面之貝爾哥洛特，則作庫斯克以南一白四十公里爲此突出點之蘇軍中心點，北面之奥萊爾位於庫斯克以北一百二十公里，去冬蘇軍曾血戰數月，企圖奪囘該地而未果。蘇軍指揮部似已充分明了其陣地之暴露，並鑒於了莫森柯之覆轍，祗在奥萊爾或貝爾哥洛特採取攻勢，以改進其軍略上不利之地位。目前德軍在貝爾哥洛特之局部進攻，已使蘇軍指揮部放棄其保守政策，而下令進攻矣，於　此段前綫之戰事，乃行發動，此後數日中，將可判定蘇軍之攻勢，是否與去年五月間丁莫森柯之攻勢相同，將一敗而不可收拾，同時貝爾哥洛特區，自星期一日以來，即發生激戰，蘇軍力圖規敗其星期日所失去之高地時，以生力師團及坦克車旅團，加入作戰，仰攻該高地及其附近區域，蘇方大隊空軍亦協助作戰，蘇軍在該區集中大批軍隊，德方指揮部亦得不不抽調大批預者，反攻蘇方之坦克車隊。目前關於德方勝利之訉，尙不可得，因戰事正在激烈進行中。惟據最初所得之前綫情報而觀，蘇軍已損失大批坦克車，殆無可疑，德國之現代防守武器，在奥萊爾以南之廣大戰綫上，曾殲滅蘇軍甚多，其始蘇軍在該區似有獲勝模樣，但蘇軍進抵德軍主要戰綫前，即遭德砲火之猛烈轟擊，德步兵乘機反攻，將蘇軍逐退，至其原陣地之外，戰事現仍在進行，雙方均繼續抽調以備隊應戰。據德國新聞社訊，星期一日之戰况可繼述如下，（一）各段之德陣地均在　守中，蘇軍在任何地方均未能予以突破。（二）德坦克車部隊尙未大規模應用。（三）德平射砲已擊毀蘇坦克車甚多目前陸地既有激戰，德空軍亦極爲活躍，聞蘇機星期一日共損失一百二十二架。又據昨晚路透社莫斯科通訊內稱，德坦克車已在二三地點侵入蘇軍隊綫，其中一隊曾攻佔村鎭兩處，蘇聯情報局昨日午夜發表公報，謂七月六日蘇軍在奥萊爾庫斯克及貝爾哥洛特三區，繼續與德方之强大坦克車及步兵隊作戰云。</p>
<h3>西西里上空　發生大空戰　反軸心飛行堡壘　受攔截損失慘重</h3>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　據海通社訊美國廣播公司特別訪員蒲迪德昨晚發表消息，敘述地中海上空之戰事，爲爭取空中霸權之戰事，渠稱在地中海戰區空襲軸心國目標之飛行堡壘，常遭軸心國防空部隊堅強之囘擊，如星期一美機三十架，空襲西西里時，遭遇德義飛機一百架之接戰，協約國飛機又於星期日某一戰役中，被軸心國飛機五十架之攔截，星期一空戰之激烈，開從來所未有之前例，軸心國飛機，猛攻飛行堡壘，宛如一羣黃蜂云。</p>
<p>羅馬七日中央社電　據斯蒂芬尼社訉，反軸心空軍，於星期日在西西里上空，與軸心飛機猛烈交戰三次。共被擊落二十五架，最劇烈之一役，係發生於喀坦尼亞平地之上空，當時有大隊之四引擎美森炸機，以戰鬥機護送，　圖飛越該地區之目標，但遭義空軍截擊，美機確被擊落者九十八架，另有五架，大致亦已被毀，又有九十五架受傷頗重。已塞洛角之南，亦曾發生空戰，反軸心機一大隊，被擊散，是役擊落敵機五架，另有兩架，大致亦被毀，又有十架被擊傷。另有一隊義戰鬥機，截擊由多數戰鬥機保護之反軸心雙引擎轟炸機三十架，擊落敵戰鬥機兩架，並擊傷轟炸機一架，及戰鬥機一架。</p>

<h3>四十一期戶口糧　將恢復爲二升　蘇米二萬石明運滬其他各地陸續裝運</h3>

<p>市糧局長發表談話　近數日來本市食米，因黑市上升，市民莫不關注。中央社記浙昨晨特訪市糧食局長張顯之於官邸，叩以本市食米情况，當承發表談話，略謂：「本市米糧之採購運輸，自改移上海區米糧聯營社負責辦理後，値此新舊交替之際，黑市米價突然發生空前漲風，顯然爲米奸作祟，再度施展其搜購囤積枝兩，罔　民生，良深痛心。査本市食米供應，　對無處匱乏，市民儘可安心，外傳種種，純係無稽流言，事實固勝於雄辯，食米供應供不致洧所中斷，蘇州方而食米十萬包，揚州二萬包，湖州三萬包，即可分別運滬。上　區米糧聯運社現正積極從事趕速裝運中。頃接蘇州來電，食米一萬六千包，計共二萬石，已定於今日（八日）出米，九日即可起運抵滬。蘇她餘米八萬四千包，亦將賡續運滬，是以食米之源源抵達，市區民食無足祀憂」云</p>

<h3>統一推進慈善事業的感想　上海市貧病救濟協會聞蘭亭林康侯袁履全登　（三）慈善事業的理想</h3>
<p>根據上述關於統一推進慈善事業的幾個問題與若干因難。蘭亭等交換觀感，咸認爲統一推進、確爲今後慈善事業必循的途徑，而且愈速實行，愈爲私益。不過爲求統一推進不只是一句口號，要求其切實發生功效，使由慈善事業之統一推進，順利發展，塡平人類缺陷，消滅社會不幸，眞正實現一人不獨親其親，子其子」的理想，使將來新社會上，再也用不到慈善事業。下列各點，爲蘭事等共同之理想，竊願就止於有道。並期彼此共勉：</p>
<p>第一，慈善事業之統一推進，不在於政府當局之法律命令，而有賴於普遍的與深入的宣傳的解釋。因此，對於這一運動。似宜以上海爲首倡，漸次推行至全國，尤盼各大報章輿論機關，廣爲闡揚勸勉，同時，各慈善團體經營者，各界熱心人士，對於這一運動，或舉行座談。或個別硏究，或在報章發表意見，或對關係方而提供意見，務使在最短期內，動員輿論，展開熱烈的檢討、集中各方面的結論，求得最正確最完善的具體辦法，我們相信，這樣作成的方案，一定比較由少數人在家裏枯思苦索出來的要更切實更有力得多。而在這公開討論的過程中，上述若干問題與困難，也可以在無形中解消了。</p>
<p>第二，爲統一推巡慈善事業，組織方面，自然需要一個中心機稱。這個中心機構，是今後統一推行慈善事業的調査，設計，指導，推動，審核，監督的總機關，因此，首先，他必須集中人材，不但應該羅致現在經營慈善事業的優秀的指導者與工作者，並且要羅致從前辦有成績及富有經騐諸　同時，更在慈善事業以外羅致調査，統計，設計，及其他各種專門家，集思廣益，羣策羣力。其次，這個中心機構，應該得到政府及關係常局有力的協助，但同時，政府除了在原則上的指導與實施工作上給予種種必要的方便之外，對於人事及內務，應勿加以干涉，使能充分發揮其效能。至於原有各慈善團體及其事業，自常在統一推進的必要並合理發展的必要而加以適當的調査，應該擴大者擴大之，宜於縮小者縮小之，必須合併者合併之，務使今後的慈善事業，意志集中，力量集中，無一分人力，物力，財力不發生十分的效力。</p>
<p>第三，在統一推進慈善事業的實際工作方面，基本原則，在使保持各該慈善團體的原有工作成績，進而發揚若干慈善團體特殊優良的工作方式與方法，使所有慈善團體一致實行，以提高工作效能，同時，接受各慈善團體數十年及百年來辦理善業的經騐與敎訓，確立今後推進慈善事業的工作方針與具體方法，而對於若干社團的錯誤與缺陷，及事業失敗的原因，亦須平心靜氣，進行檢討、俾今後工作中知可避忌，人事方面，自宜保持各慈善團體原制，力避任何干涉及更動,以期收穫統一推行協助各善團的實際效力。尤當特別提出的是今後的慈善事業，必須是積極性的事業。因此，在工作上，必須與教育機關、文化機關以至各企業部門，密切協力，分工合作，不再限於孤立的和消極的救濟工作</p>
<p>最後，關於募款方面，在統一推行以後，自然要一變過去各自爲政的方式，在統一的整個的計劃之下，作有組織的籌募。例如：一方面依據實際需要而確定勸募目標，一方面針對國民的實力而採取適宜的方案，在原則上是「有錢出錢，有力出力」，務求每一次勸募，沒有一個國民不出錢或出力。先進各國的慈善勸募辦法。實在値得我們效法。對個人勸募方面在求普遍，無一人不參加，而互以未出錢未出力爲恥，在對社團公司，工廠勸募方面，更可採用所得累進比率捐款辦法，規定每一廠商在每年凈利中依累進此率提出千分之一作爲慈善事業的固定捐款。在統一的有計畫的勸募之下，今後慈善事業，經費問題，縱不能立臻寬裕，常亦不致如目前這樣嚴重。</p>
<p>以上是團　等對於本報　　「慈善事業急須統一進進文　相交換觀感的要點，現在竭誠提供於有　緒君子，尙望各方展開討論，不吝賜教，使今後慈善事業能創造出更偉大的成績與更光榮的紀錄。（完）</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>工業精神</h3>
<p>辦理工業，應有不求近利，尤其是不求暴利之目光，與腳踏實地，尤其是滴聽環境之步驟，繼有成功之希望，吾人認爲目前辦理工廠。應有下列四種精神：</p>
<p>（一）創造精神　辦工業不宜因　。更不宜墨守舊法、要有創造性，能自己運用心思，才力、求出新的式　興新的方法，以求取勝他人，不致落後。</p>
<p>（二）科學精神　一切組織　備技術，應力求合理化，尤其要有科學管理的精神，事事應合於科學方法，纔能使工業現代化。</p>
<p>（三）法治精神　辦工業應力求法治。要有法治的精神，破除個人喜惡之心，與親戚故舊的情面，倘膽顧情面，不依法紀，便要破壞公共的法規，與共同依循的紀律。</p>
<p>（四）進取精神辦工業要有不斷的努力，不可因循苟且，自趨落伍，蓋工業之經營，不進則退，倘無勇往精進之精神，以求業務之發展，必受淘汰無疑、</p>
<p>此爲今日工業家共同應有之精神，戰時中國工業之復興在此，戰後中國工業之發展亦在此。</p>
<h3>日經濟使節團　昨由東京乘機抵滬　國長小倉正恒氏發表談話</h3>
<p>中日交歡民間經濟使節團小倉正恒氏等一行，業於昨（七）日下午四時五十分，由東京乘機抵滬，旋即前赴大塲鎭表忠塔，八絃園及上海神社參拜後，驅車往華懋飯店下榻處。當晚八時，由出席百老匯大厦之田尻公使歡迎晚餐會，該團團長小倉氏，在華懋飯店會見記者團，發表談話如次：</p>
<p>吾等素有以民間經濟界人資格，訪問中國與諸位親切懇談，並考察經濟界現况之宿願，至今日時機成熟，得了却多年願望，實感欣快之至。顯中日兩國國民相處近隣，且亦</p>
<p>同文同種　之民族，自古交往頻繁，自至近代亞洲民族高呼抵抗西歐諸國侵略，以復興亞洲以來，中日兩國之提携，已有其必然性。此固爲兩國先　者所倡言者，而兩國獨具隻眼之有識人士，其努力目標，亦無不向此處着眼，惟以各種情形尙未至成功，却反而引起不幸事件，思之不勝遣憾。尙幸日本後即闡明日本之東亞政策，係以建設根據道義精神之大東亞秩新序爲目標，與中國以防共協定，善憐友好，經濟提携之近衛三原則爲根本方針，而在中國嗣有汪主席閣下以下有識之士，起而響應，脫走重慶，表明協力日本，拯救中國，向建設大東亞邁進之決意，更於今年一月，對英美宣戰，與日本</p>
<p>同生共死　參加大東亞戰爭，其能如此，余不禁爲兩國爲大東亞十萬萬民族額手稱慶。如此中日兩國以事實解決，久成懸案之中日提携，但兩國能一致協力共禦外敵，此事在中日國交史上，尙屬創見，然此空前之事實，決非人爲的，而是歷史之必然趨囘。且日本乘此中國參戰機會，實行撤廢中國百年來桎梏之治外法權，並交還租界，兩國在東亞之互相協力，更進一步。如是中日兩國，現在全東亞一致協力下向遂行大東亞戰爭，建設大東亞共榮圈邁進，但自現在世界戰爭之性格而言，如大東亞戰爭不勝，則大東亞共榮圈之建設當屬不可能，而大東亞共榮圈不能建設，則大東亞民族永無福耻可求，然無論戰爭或建設，於經濟上所負責任，殊甚重大，此毋庸吾人贅述，因此吾等至今必須充分認識時代的事實，以民間經濟人之資格，在經濟上</p>
<p>協力提携　是爲最感緊要者。但無論如何高呼提携，若心中漠然置之，則所謂提携努力之結果，成爲一句口頭禪而已。是以欲得融和，務須交必敬，行必信，否則終不能獲得效果也，吾等組織民間使節團來此目的，不外乎對中國收同租界，得以脫離百年來所受英美桎桔，囘復新中國面目，表示慶賀，並以民問經濟人資格，與中國政府當局，及民間經濟界，實行交懽，使中日提携，更形鞏固，尙祈諸位賜予援助云云。</p>

<p>揭貼佈告　並於密告箱旁揭貼佈告云：「敬啓者，木會遵照常局意旨，及謀同業福利，根據本會章程，設立評價委員會，開始以還，迭經召開會議，評訂限價，送謂當局核准，轉發各會員商號一體進照在案，査邇日物價漲勢又趨猖熾，本會聞訊，殊感不安，惟爲一秉初衷，不得不採取有效措置，除樂於接受各界善意貢獻外，並望格外協助，俾資於成，同時尤盼我會員同業恪守定章，勿自蹈法綱，諸希鑒諒。</p>

<h3>罵</h3>
<p>— 歐陽夢藟</p>
<p>破口大「駡」，暗暗的「駡」，含淚的「駡」，藏刀的「駡」，……「罵」聲到處皆是，我幾乎要疑惑這是一個「駡人」的世界了。遇到甚麼不如意的事便「駡」、就好像大聲的呼呌：「我來了，怏讓路」，因爲他們不議，於是你就「駡」了。</p>
<p>也於是就越「駡」越糟。而越糟你也就越「駡」得厲害丁。</p>
<p>也許有時侯你自己忽然感覺到各式各樣的「罵」並不能幫助你甚麼，而自已反而「駡」得很吃力，於是你是這樣想，也這樣說：「我不駡人了」，「我寬恕一切了」……</p>
<p>你說：「我不駡人了」，意思就是說：「他們仍是値得駡而我不高興駡就是了」，你又說：「我寬恕一切了」，意思也就是說：「錯的是別人、而我自己是對的」，所以你就恕了他們……這是多麼可笑的事，你把審判官的嘴移裝到自己的嘴上，又戴上了主觀的眼睛，無怪乎一切要受你的「恕」了，</p>
<p>那麼怎樣才可以正確地避免不中肯的「駡」呢？</p>
<p>我們應該要時時仔細的這樣想：</p>
<p>「那些被我用各種方式駡的人們，我可曾認識他們？了解他們？懂得他們？他們所以不　道的原因是什麼？他們的困難是甚麼？他們的缺點是甚麼？他們如何爲自己「解釋」？……」想完了再不妨「設身處地」。於是你便可以發現他們與我。</p>
<h3>眞正快樂的人</h3>
<p>— 寄塵</p>
<p>「怏樂」有直覺的，所以普通一般人「好像」很了解什麼是「快樂」。但，這種直覺的「快樂」是否都是眞正的「快樂」，却甚可疑。其中有一部份僅不過是片刻的「刺激」罷丁。</p>
<p>尋花問柳，是否快樂？沉迷賭窟，是否快樂？投機囤積，是否快樂？高歌酣舞，揮霍千金無吝色……是眞正的「快樂」　　才不呢！我以爲這些都不是眞正的快樂，都是「色情狂」，「歛財狂」，「貪得狂」……所致的結果。這些都祇是片刻的刺激，刺激……把他們的腦神經練得「麻木不仁」吧了。這種舉勸所得結果、不外乎是毀滅，把自已推進無底的深　去，</p>
<p>爲什麼一般人「自甘墮落」，甘心情願同減亡的邊緣跑去呢？因爲他們不了解什麼是眞正的「快樂」。</p>
<p>眞正「快樂」的人，一定先使他人「快樂」；那麼當他心舒神泰　覺「快樂」的時候，不會被內心的歉仄所驚醒而破壞了他一剎那問的愉快。因爲凡是將他人苦痛作自己「快樂」基礎的人決不會得到眞正的「快樂」。</p>
<p>眞正的「快樂」。是從內心所表現出來的，決不是外表刺激得到的所可比擬。有許多人出入汽車代步，居住高樓人厦、吃的是山珍海味……一切都是極盡奢侈之能事；其外裏可確是優游「快樂」了但，我們也不難想像他們內心的苦痛呢！所以，眞正「快樂」的人決不是一天到晚想如何享樂者的，反之，却是努力工作，盡心盡力於社會福利事業者。</p>
<h3>星火</h3>
<p>— 良月</p>
<p>人往往不注意「小」的地方；其實，一件大事、是由一件「小」事醞釀而成的；反之若要辦人事，須先從「小」處着手。「燎原始自星火」，別忘了這句話。</p>

<p>— 沈沈</p>
<p>「張參謀，你帶他們到外邊去，會同那個通匪的人，從嚴的拷問，今天晚上）定要交出檢械，供出匪黨，聽候我處辦」，×司令向着站在旁邊的一個穿灰布衣的說着。</p>
<p>「李鎭長，我們到外邊去吧！不要再打擾司令了」，張參謀邊說邊向、李鎭長等揮着手。於是三個人向×司令鞠了九十度的躬退出司令室、張參謀在前頭走。外邊的勤務兵瞥目他們三個人出來，就凑上去，前低聲地對李鎭長說：「怎麼啦！了結了嗎？我明天上午到你家裏。有話同你說」。李鎭長點點頭，跟着張參謀，走進另一間暗而低的好像柴房似的地方站定了。過去屋角裏，就是阿坤反綁的地方。</p>
<p>「李鎭長！你過於憤激了，剛才你向司令說的話，太沒趣了。我們都是自己人。不肯連累你的」。張參謀似乎是一個好人，以照顧的口吻，向李鎭長說。</p>
<p>「張參謀！這件事實在太尷尬了！姓吳的——就指阿坤，的確窮得飯都不周全，石子裏榨不出油來，人又是挺老實的，我們實在也硬不起心來辦這件事。我想還是請張參謀幫幫忙」。陸甲長也忍不住先挿嘴着說。</p>
<p>眞的！張參謀！你是本區裏的人，雖然是遠鄰。總算同鄉。我這兩年做了這個斷命的鎭長、傷良心的事，也不知幹了幾囘了，今天這個部隊開拔。要什麼什麼，明大那個部隊開到。要什麼，什麼，賠了時間，貼了錢不算，還有挨駡的份．你聽剛才司令的話，好像我們也在通同匪類。構說交出，豎說交出。我這個罪，也夠受了，再不要幹這勞什子的鎭長了。我已活了五十多歲，馬上就死已不算短壽了」！李鎭長剛才挨過駡，想起往事，憤慨地發了一陣牢騷。</p>
<p>「李鎭長的怨氣，的確受得夠了。不過這囘子的事，總得要了結的。張參謀！你是同鄉人，請你特別疏通疏通，要不然，弄僵了大家沒趣，而且說不定急出人命來，也是不好的」！陸甲長也有點不耐煩，從心底裏冒出了不平之火的說着。</p>
<p>「我很明白，這種事情我也不大贊成。不過，我實在沒有辦法講句公平話。要不幹，那就沒有別的事情做，要幹，那就肚子脹煞，老實說，你們兩位當了鎭長，受的累還不算多，我在隊部裏混了幾個月、眼睛看見的，經手了結的，造孽事情正多哩！今天不是發牢騷的時候，我們有機會改天談吧，不過，今天那個人——指着屋角裏的阿坤——的事。我看還是了結的好，要不然他要受苦的。看他好像有病的樣子。也吃不起苦的，你們以爲怎樣」？張參謀似乎有點潔身自好，而莫可自拔的口氣，很黯然的說出上面一段話。（六）</p>

<h3>Welcoming Our Friendly Nation's "China Economic Investigation Group"</h3>
<p>The "China Economic Investigation Group," organized by the Japanese East Asia Economic Roundtable Association, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The mission of the group was previously explained by the group leader, Mr. Ogura, and others in Tokyo on the 3rd of this month. Its main purpose is to "engage in concrete discussions with Chinese financial giants and the National Government regarding economic cooperation between the two countries, fully accept the opinions of Chinese personnel, and not only take collective action but also conduct private, in-depth talks to gather opinions. Sufficient research should be conducted on Chinese economic issues, such as prices, finance, trade, and food, to benefit the co-existence and co-prosperity of the industries and economies of both countries." We believe that the group's ability to engage in private discussions in addition to collective action, exchange opinions, and fully accept the opinions of Chinese personnel is a characteristic of the group's investigation mission, and it can also be said that this is where the group can adapt to the times. At the same time, we can predict that the group's future success will surely be due to these characteristics. We, in the position of the Chinese people, are willing to take the lead in providing a few points of advice to contribute to the members of the group, so that they may have an outline of understanding of China's current economic problems.</p>
<p>(1) The Price Problem: In recent years, the most painful thing for the Chinese people has been the high prices and the heavy pressure on life. There are many factors that contribute to high prices. Some points are unavoidable in the wartime phenomenon, such as the reduction of supplies, which is common to all countries. However, some points are unique to China, such as large-scale hoarding; some points are more serious in China than in other countries, such as the decrease in currency purchasing power and poor transportation. The speed of rising prices must be considered a miracle by friendly nations. The Chinese people also understand that a hard life during wartime is within their duty, and that rising prices are a necessary phenomenon, but it is unbearable when it exceeds hardship and becomes pain, and when it not only rises but soars. This is one.</p>
<p>(2) The Food Problem: Food is the people's food, and the people's food is the most important part of the people's livelihood. Frankly speaking, the largest number of Chinese people, the farmers, generally believe that life is for "food," and their entire lives are entrusted to "food." Therefore, it is useless to talk about stabilizing the people's livelihood without solving the food problem. Chinese farmers have always valued reality and are most unaccustomed to hearing empty words, especially when people talk about "heaven" but do "earth." This is what the Chinese people find the most discredited and unpleasant. The food problem is even more so. This is two.</p>
<p>(3) The Problem of Increasing Production: Increasing production means increasing supplies. Abundant supplies can strengthen the overall war effort externally and quickly complete the Greater East Asia War; internally, it can stabilize prices and reduce the pressure on people's lives. The National Government has clearly stipulated this in the wartime economic policy program. We believe that the implementation has not been done with all our strength. Taking the industry in the Shanghai area as an example, not only has there been no increase in production, but there has also been a decrease in production. The reasons for this include power restrictions, lack of raw materials, and transportation difficulties. We hope that the policy decisions and the implementation of the facts are completely consistent. On the one hand, we are vigorously increasing production, but on the other hand, we are not actively eliminating the causes that hinder production. Even unintentionally creating causes that hinder production, all of these should be paid attention to and corrected. This is three.</p>
<p>(4) The Problem of Material Exchange: Material exchanges between the peaceful areas of Central China, North China, and South China, each with what they have in excess to exchange for what they lack, are very important to the price problem and the people's livelihood problem. In the implementation of exchanges, the most urgent issue is the limitation of transportation. We believe that the importance of material exchange is no less than other economic issues, and it is worth paying attention to and trying to smooth it out as much as possible. This is four.</p>
<p>(5) The Currency Problem: Currency is closely related to all economic activities and the daily life of the people, and its importance needs no explanation. At present, the Central Reserve Bank is the only currency in Central China and South China. Its foundation is stable and its reserves are abundant, as the government authorities have repeatedly stated. However, the continuous decline in purchasing power is a matter that must be addressed, both in terms of national financial resources and people's faith. This is five.</p>
<p>Finally, we sincerely look forward to intensifying and strengthening Sino-Japanese economic cooperation under the principle of equality and mutual benefit. To be honest, according to the current factual environment, it is impossible to achieve satisfactory results in adjusting China's economic problems without the full assistance of Japan. In other words, China itself should do its best to revitalize all economic issues, and at the same time, friendly nations must actively and thoroughly help. For example, in March of this year, our friendly nation returned the economic control rights of Central China to China, which gave the Chinese people a good impression. Although we have not done as well as expected, this is a personnel issue, and we will of course try to adjust it. At the same time, we hope that the authorities of friendly nations will further encourage and correct us enthusiastically so that we can succeed. We absolutely accept the enthusiastic support and instructions of friendly nations, and at the same time, we also expect friendly nations to listen to the opinions and suggestions of most of our people. Only in this way can we achieve true cooperation. At the same time, friendly nations must take the improvement of China's economic problems as the most important object of Sino-Japanese cooperation; otherwise, it will be a burden in the process of cooperation.</p>
<p>What we have said above is our report on our own condition. Of course, it is intuitive, but it is sincere. We ask the brilliant doctor to consider the condition we have described, then add to it by examining each part, and then use his superb knowledge and rich experience to give an accurate diagnosis and the right medicine, so that the patient can take it and of course recover. Who is this brilliant doctor? It is the "China Economic Investigation Group" of our friendly nation, Japan, which has already come to China. We are very fortunate to have this brilliant doctor come to visit us during our illness, and we believe that our illness will surely be cured because of this. In this mood, we sincerely welcome the members of the friendly nation's investigation group and wish them a smooth future and good health!</p>

<h3>Kula Gulf, New Georgia Island: Japanese Naval and Air Forces Display Power, Sinking Three Enemy Ships and Downing Ten Enemy Planes</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency): The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 7th that: (1) In the Solomon Islands area, after the enemy forces landed on Rentoba Island on the 30th of last month, they are now trying to advance on New Georgia Island, and have landed at several locations on the island. Japanese troops are currently continuing to fight the enemy in various parts of the island. (2) The situation in the Kula Gulf area of northwestern New Georgia Island is as follows: The Japanese naval garrison on the island and the Japanese mine warfare squadron fighting in the area sank three enemy ships at dawn on the 5th. The type of ships is unknown. (2) On the morning of the 5th, the Japanese air force engaged in combat with enemy aircraft over Kula Gulf and shot down ten enemy planes. (3) Several destroyers belonging to the Japanese mine warfare squadron attacked the enemy at midnight on the 5th. A strong fleet composed of more than ten enemy cruisers and destroyers was attacked, sinking one enemy cruiser, destroying and burning another, and causing the rest to flee in disarray.</p>
<p>Argentina, Jingcheng, 7th (Central News Agency): According to a dispatch from New Jinshan, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Military Headquarters announced yesterday that Japanese air squadrons bombed Rentoba Island again on the 5th, and US fighter planes engaged in aerial combat with the excellent Japanese air force.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency): According to news from Washington, the United States Navy Department issued a public statement yesterday announcing that the American destroyer "Strong" has been lost in the southwestern Pacific. It is said that the ship was sunk by a Japanese submarine with a torpedo on the evening of July 4 in the Solomon Islands waters. At the same time, the public statement also admitted that the American fleet suffered slight damage during a battle in the Solomon Sea yesterday.</p>
<p>The Situation on Rentoba Island</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency): Since June 30, the enemy forces have launched a very tenacious and fierce counter-offensive in the Solomon Islands area. The Japanese army units in various areas have also dispatched air, sea, and land forces to bravely counterattack. The two sides are currently engaged in combat day and night in the vicinity of New Georgia Island and the surrounding islands, which are close to the enemy's base on Guadalcanal. The battle situation is recorded as follows: First, at dawn on June 30, the enemy forces, divided into ten (sea trucks) and landing boats, and protected by a fleet of dozens of military transport ships, escorted by a large number of protective aircraft and ships, landed at several locations around Rentoba Port on the north coast of Rentoba Island, near the southwest coast of New Georgia Island. Fierce fighting immediately broke out with the Japanese army. On the same day, the enemy forces landed at several locations on the southeast and northwest coasts of New Georgia Island. Until dawn on the 5th, the Chetsu Army again attempted to land with a large number of boats at several key points on the island facing Kura Qian. However, the Japanese mine warfare squadron had anticipated this, so it immediately attacked the enemy escort fleet. Under the waning moon, it directly approached the dark enemy ships and launched the traditional Japanese naval night attack, sinking three enemy ships in an instant. At that time, the Japanese field artillery positions also fiercely bombarded, responding to the friendly ships, controlling the enemy fleet, and recording great achievements. The fierce fighting on land also continued. The Japanese land and naval garrison fought fiercely with the enemy landing forces in several locations, and finally repelled a part of the enemy forces. After this fierce battle, the sky had cleared, and the Japanese warships again fired artillery at the enemy landing forces. At this time, the Crystal Army air force also flew to the top of the Junla Qian, where the enemy was patrolling, and immediately engaged in a large air battle with 40 enemy aircraft. The fierce battle was very fierce, and ten enemy aircraft were hit by bullets and emitted black smoke, forming an arc in the air, and then crashed into the sea or forest one after another, turning into a ball of fire. Until after sunset, the fierce fighting on land did not stop. That night, the enemy forces again attempted to land reinforcements, and a fleet of more than a dozen enemy ships, including cruisers and destroyers, appeared in the sea area near Kangla, thus becoming the good bait for the Japanese mine warfare squadron. Several Japanese destroyers immediately carried out operations, forcing to the closest distance to the enemy camp, and fiercely bombarded the enemy ships with torpedoes and secondary guns. When an enemy cruiser seemed to explode suddenly after a red line of fire gushed out, and an enemy cruiser was also hit by bullets and caught fire. The land battle is still continuing.</p>
<p>War Results of Japanese Troops on Both Islands</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency): From June 30 to July 5, the Japanese army, navy air force, and naval fleet severely attacked the US forces that landed on Rentoba Island and New Georgia Island, inflicting heavy damage. The war results are summarized as follows: (A) Rentoba Island area (1) War results obtained by the air force: On June 30, the Japanese naval air force sank two enemy large destroyers, one destroyer, three transport ships, one destroyer-class destroyer, three transport ships, and shot down more than 50 enemy aircraft. On July 1, the Japanese air force sank one enemy Class B cruiser, one large destroyer, and shot down more than 20 enemy aircraft. On July 2, the Japanese army and navy air force sank many enemy boats, destroyed one transport ship, shot down nine enemy aircraft, and bombed various enemy landing points, all of which were damaged and caught fire. On July 3, the Japanese military air force shot down nine enemy aircraft. On July 4, the army air force sank five enemy transport ships, more than ten boats, shot down more than 23 enemy aircraft, and bombed the enemy's military supply accumulation points, all of which were set on fire. (2) War results obtained by the destroyers: On July 2, one enemy torpedo boat each was sunk and destroyed. New Georgia Island area (1) War results obtained by the air force: On July 5, the Japanese naval air force shot down ten enemy aircraft. (2) War results obtained by the destroyers belonging to the mine warfare squadron: One enemy cruiser was sunk and one was destroyed, and both were hit by bullets and caught fire. (3) War results obtained by the land and naval garrison and the ships belonging to the naval water supply squadron: Three enemy ships were sunk, the type of ships is unknown.</p>
<h3>Chen Junhui Goes to Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency): Chen Junhui, Minister of Construction of the National Government, flew to Japan at 7:00 AM on the 7th to inspect the current construction situation in Japan under the decisive battle and to discuss with relevant parties. He was accompanied by Xu Gongding, Deputy Director of the Water Conservancy Department of the Ministry of Construction, and four others. After passing through Shanghai and Fukuoka, they arrived in Tokyo at 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Overview of Japanese Military Operations in China in One Year</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency): Six years have passed in an instant since the Lugouqiao Incident. On the occasion of the 6th anniversary, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters specially announced on the 6th the comprehensive war results obtained by the Japanese army in China in the past year since last July. It is estimated that about 457,800 corpses of the Yu army were abandoned, about 149,000 were captured, and about 96,000 surrendered. In the most recent period, the number of Yu army captured and surrendered on each front was far greater than the number of dead. As a ratio, if the number of corpses is set to 100, then the number of prisoners in the previous year was 45, and it increased to 67 in the past year. By this year, the number of Yu army captured and surrendered has exceeded the number of abandoned corpses, with a ratio of 100 to 138. In addition, Yu Fang's generals and cadres have recently come one after another to participate in the peace movement. The most notable among them is General Yan Bingdong, commander of the 24th Army Group, the only direct line unit of Yu Jiang in North China, who recently led 70,000 troops to participate in the peace movement, which proves that the Yu army's awareness of resistance has become increasingly low. After the National Government participated in the war, the Japanese government adopted a new policy toward China, and the Yu Fang's significance in the war was completely lost. At the same time, Japan's true intention to seek the development of the Chinese nation has gradually and deeply penetrated into the Yu Fang's interior. The significance and war results of the Japanese army's various battles with China in the past year are divided into the following: (1) Zhe-Gan Operation (from mid-May to mid-September of the 31st year of the Republic of China in the third war zone of Yu in Central China) The Japanese army launched this operation in order to destroy the only stronghold in southeastern mainland China that the United Kingdom and the United States relied on to form a second war. Its scale was slightly smaller than the Wuhan raid. After the collapse of Yu (third war zone), its counter-offensive attempt was also completely crushed. The war results are estimated to be about 42,000 Yu army abandoned corpses and about 11,000 captured. (2) Conghua Operation (from the end of May to the beginning of September of the 31st year of the Republic of China in the seventh war zone of Yu in South China) In order to respond to the Zhe-Gan Operation in Central China, this operation was launched against Yu (seventh war zone). Because the Japanese army made the first move, it inflicted heavy damage on the Yu army. (3) Second Northern Hebei Suppression Operation (from the beginning of July to the middle of September of the 31st year of the Republic of China in the Northern Hebei region of North China) The Japanese army started this operation in cooperation with the Manchurian army in order to completely suppress the communist bandits entrenched in the mountainous areas of Northern Hebei. As a result, it dealt a great blow to the Yu army. (4) Southern Taihang Mountain Operation (from mid-June to the end of July of the 31st year of the Republic of China in North China) This was the third phase of the operation continuing the Jin-Ji provincial border operation, targeting a part of the Yu (21st Army) and (24th Army) Army Group, and launching this operation in the steep Taihang Mountains. As a result, the Yu army was completely destroyed. (5) Second Central Shandong Operation (from mid-August to the beginning of September of the 31st year of the Republic of China in Shandong Province, North China) Since the beginning of August, a mutiny occurred in the army of Shandong Gan Xuezhong. The Japanese army launched this operation to annihilate it. Due to skillful tactics, it achieved remarkable war results. In this battle, the Yu army abandoned 3,000 corpses and 1,000 people were captured. (6) Eastern Shouhu Western Region Suppression Operation (from late September to early October of the 31st year of the Republic of China in North China) In order to completely annihilate the remnants of the communist army near the old Huang Ze of Xi, the Japanese army formed a tight encirclement and gradually compressed it, giving it a major blow. The communist army abandoned 1,300 corpses and 1,300 people were captured. (7) Autumn Suppression Operation (from late October to late November of the 31st year of the Republic of China in Shanxi Province, North China) This operation was launched to destroy the communist army entrenched in the southern part of the Taihang Mountains. The war results were further expanded to the entire territory of Shanxi Province, and a thorough suppression war was carried out. (8) Su-Huai Operation (from mid-February to mid-March of the 32nd year of the Republic of China in Jiangsu Province, Central China) Under the cooperation of the National Government army, Yu (89th Army) and the communist army (New Fourth Army) entrenched in the Su-Huai area of Jiangsu Province had their base destroyed, blocking Yu Fang's activities within the Japanese-occupied area. The total number of corpses abandoned by the Yu-Communist army was 1,800, and 7,000 people were captured. (9) Jiangbei Annihilation Operation (from early February to the end of March of the 32nd year of the Republic of China in Hubei Province, Central China) In the northern area of Dongting Lake, Yu (Jiangbei Advance Army) and (118th Division) and Wang Jincai's army were surrounded and suppressed and annihilated. The public security in the area has been restored. In this battle, the Yu army abandoned 8,600 corpses and about 23,200 people were captured. (10) Taihang Spring Operation (from mid-April to the end of May of the 32nd year of the Republic of China in Shanxi and Henan provinces, North China) A fierce attack was launched on the Yu 24th Army Group entrenched in the border area between Shanxi and Henan provinces and the communist army which was acting in the border area between Shanxi, Chahar and Hebei provinces, completely suppressing the Yu-Communist forces in the Ji-Cha war zone. Pang Bingxun, commander of the 24th Army Group of Yu, and Sun Yinying, commander of the newly formed Fifth Army, etc. participated in the peace movement, giving a major blow to Yu Fang. The Yu army abandoned 11,500 corpses, and 75,000 people were captured and surrendered. (11) Jiangnan Offensive Operation (from the beginning of May to the middle of June of the 32nd year of the Republic of China in the northern part of Dongting Lake in Central China and the area opposite Yichang) A surprise attack was launched on the Yu (29th and 10th Army Groups) acting in the Dongting Lake northern shore area, the Yu Fang's granary area. Yu's key points were continuously seized, and finally Hunan's granary was occupied and placed under the rule of the National Government. In this battle, the Yu army abandoned 45,700 corpses, and 6,400 people were captured. The Chinese Japanese Expeditionary Force fought 11 times during this period, among which, in the Su-Huai Operation, the number of Yu army captured was nearly three times the number of frozen corpses. In the Jiangbei Annihilation Operation, it was nearly two and a half times, and in the Taihang Mountain Spring Operation, it was nearly six and a half times. This proves that Yu Fang's resistance has been significantly reduced.</p>
<h3>Chinese Ambassador to Japan, Cai Peizhen, Broadcasts to the Country, Introducing Japan Under the Wartime System</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency): Chinese Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Cai Peizhen, gave a broadcast to his compatriots in China at 3:00 PM on the 6th at the Central Broadcasting Station here, introducing Japan under the wartime system. He listed four points: the rationalization of Japanese people's lives during wartime, the recognition of the national position, the efforts to increase production, and the training situation of Japanese teenagers. Finally, he pointed out the determination of China and Japan to fight the enemy together and kill the enemy.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Thailand Explain Their Determination to Cooperate with Japan</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 7th (Central News Agency): The Bangkok Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and various overseas Chinese organizations in Thailand stated that six years have passed since the outbreak of the July 7 Incident. They specially issued a letter to their compatriots on the 7th, expressing their determination to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. The main points are as follows: Looking back since 1937, Chiang Kai-shek, manipulated by the United Kingdom and the United States, combined with the Communist Party, causing the 400 million Chinese people to suffer misery, which has lasted for six years. Now, because friendly Japan has swept away the British and American forces in East Asia, Yu Fang has also been forced to retreat to Chongqing and is declining. Fortunately, China is working hard to promote construction under the leadership of Chairman Wang, and the National Government's declaration of war on the United Kingdom and the United States has given the Yu Fang generals and soldiers great stimulation, and they have successively supported the National Government. In addition, regarding the restoration of Chinese sovereignty, it has been confirmed in the Sino-Japanese Treaty. On January 9 of this year, when the National Government participated in the war, Japan decided to return all special concessions in China, abolish extraterritorial rights, and other privileges, and will immediately implement them. For the future prosperity of the East Asian nation, we must further strengthen our strength and move toward the ultimate goal of defeating the United Kingdom and the United States. We, the overseas Chinese in Thailand, will make our greatest efforts to achieve victory and build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in the Philippines Issue a Circular Telegram</p>
<p>Manila, 7th (Central News Agency): The Philippine Overseas Chinese Association issued a circular telegram to Yu Fang on the 7th, the sixth anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Incident, urging it to reflect, based on the general will of all overseas Chinese in the Philippines. The main points of the telegram are as follows: Six years have passed since the outbreak of the Lugouqiao Incident. During this period, Yu Fang always hoped for British and American assistance to resist Japan. However, in fact, the so-called British and American assistance has been decreasing, and the hardship of the anti-Japanese war zone has been increasing, only making innocent people suffer sacrifice, which does not help the country and the nation. Now that Japan has implemented a new policy toward China, the unequal treaties that have bound China for more than a hundred years have been cancelled one after another, and the concessions of various countries in China have been successively taken back. All these facts prove that Japan and China have sincerely cooperated, closely cooperated, and cooperated to liberate the East Asian nation and build the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. From this point of view, Yu Fang has lost its significance in the anti-Japanese war, and the elimination of the anti-Japanese war goal is even more self-evident. We, the 100,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines, deeply hope that our compatriots in the anti-Japanese war zone will quickly stop this meaningless anti-Japanese war and rise up to participate in the work of building a new East Asia, because only the early realization of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is our supreme mission.</p>
<h3>Trainees of Two Battalion Training Camps Receive Food Expenses from Chairman Wang</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency): Chairman Wang specially awarded each trainee of the two public servant and youth group training camps a daily food subsidy of two yuan per person, and designated it for purchasing nutritious vegetables, such as tofu. The two camp trainees were extremely excited and grateful for the leader's care.</p>
<h3>North China Communist Suppression Committee Holds a Plenary Meeting; Wang Kemin Succeeds as Chairman</h3>
<p>Beijing, 7th (Central News Agency): The North China Communist Suppression Committee held a plenary meeting on the 6th because the previous chairman, Zhu Shen, passed away on the 2nd. Qi Binyuan and Zhang Zhongzhi attended the meeting to hold the inauguration ceremony of the new chairman, Wang Kemin.</p>
<h3>North China Development Company: Recent Business Overview - Total Investment Exceeds 540 Million Yuan, Loans Exceed 820 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Beijing, 7th (Central News Agency) - The North China Development Company has made significant contributions to the revitalization and development of important industries in North China. Its total investment has reached 544.5 million yuan, and its total loans have reached 822.6 million yuan, for a combined total of 1.3671 billion yuan.

<h3>Ministry of Food Urges Public to Save Rice and Use More Coarse Grains to Replenish Grain Reserves and Adapt to Wartime System</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - In view of the fact that the grain output of our country has been insufficient in the past, the Ministry of Food believes that the population in the peaceful regions has increased sharply recently, and the consumption of rice has increased even more. The reason is that most Chinese people are accustomed to the habit of southerners eating rice, so that other agricultural products such as wheat, sorghum, corn, and sweet potatoes, although a large amount are produced every year in various places, are mostly used as staple foods by some civilians, and most of them are used as non-staple foods, which are mostly consumed and are not suitable for the wartime principle of frugality. Now that the Greater East Asia War is underway, our government is cooperating in ensuring the stability of the people's food and the security of military needs. It is necessary to have sufficient food and long-term reserves to be effective. The storage of food is most durable with rice, which is suitable for storage, so saving rice is the most urgent task. Using coarse grains as the main food can save rice. Reducing the consumption of rice means more grain reserves for the country. It is hoped that the entire nation will change its concept and use coarse grains as substitute food in the future. Saving rice consumption, this proposal has been sent by the Ministry to the provincial and municipal governments and the National Commercial Control Association to quickly announce to the public and earnestly persuade them. Recently, the prices of coarse grains in various places have exceeded the price of rice. Please also find a way to limit it, and still maintain the ratio of one to one point seven with the price of rice, in order to encourage it.</p>
<h3>German Offensive Advances in Belgorod Area</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to news received here last night, the Soviet Supreme Command stated that the German army launched an offensive and admitted that the German army had made some progress in some areas of Belgorod. However, Berlin military personnel said last night that the Axis powers claimed that the German army had launched an offensive in Orel, Kursk, and Belgorod. The claim that the goal of the German army's offensive was to occupy Moscow was also a propaganda tactic, which could be used to claim its failure if the German army did not implement this plan. As for the British claim that the German army lost hundreds of tanks, it is absolutely a rumor. According to the military interviewer of Haitong News Agency, the current battle of Kursk is due to the fact that the Soviet army feels that its protruding front is unfavorable and will inevitably cause a German attack sooner or later, so it wants to strike first. The commander of the Soviet army on the central front seemed to misunderstand the intentions of the German army's local attacks last weekend, believing that it was a large-scale German offensive against Kursk, and that the only way to prevent the Kursk salient from being cut off was to take the initiative. As a result of this misunderstanding, the war was launched from the first day of the week, centered on the south of Belgorod and Orel. This situation is the same as in May of last year, when the Soviet army attacked. At that time, Marshal Timoshenko wanted to take the lead in the German offensive on the southern front, so he launched a large-scale offensive with the assault troops transferred from the Izyum area in the spring, and at the same time launched an offensive north of Kharkov to support it. The purpose was to encircle the German army in Kharkov and break through the line of the Dnieper River. The limited gains made by Ding氏 at a heavy price soon proved to be the beginning of his greatest strategic failure. The German army strictly surrounded its vanguard, causing the entire Soviet Southern Front assault force to be wiped out. Since May of this year, German reconnaissance has found that the Soviet army has been constantly concentrating on Kursk in a semi-circular shape, with the string of the salient point measuring approximately 260 kilometers. Belgorod in the south is located 140 kilometers south of Kursk and is the center of the Soviet army at this salient point. Orel in the north is located 120 kilometers north of Kursk. Last winter, the Soviet army fought bloody battles for several months in an attempt to retake the area without success. The Soviet Command seems to have fully understood the exposure of its position, and in view of the failure of the Morsenko, it only launched offensives in Orel or Belgorod to improve its unfavorable strategic position. The current local German offensive in Belgorod has forced the Soviet Command to abandon its conservative policy and order an offensive. At this time, the war on this front has begun. In the next few days, it will be possible to determine whether the Soviet offensive is the same as the Morsenko offensive in May of last year, and will be defeated and impossible to recover. At the same time, fierce battles have been taking place in the Belgorod area since the first day of the week. When the Soviet army tried to defeat the highlands it lost on Sunday, it added new divisions and tank brigades to the battle, attacking the highlands and surrounding areas. The Soviet air force also assisted in the battle. The Soviet army concentrated a large number of troops in the area, and the German Command had to draw a large number of reserves to counterattack the Soviet tank force. At present, news about the German victory is still unavailable because the war is still in full swing. However, judging from the initial front-line information, the Soviet army has undoubtedly lost a large number of tanks. German modern defensive weapons have annihilated many Soviet troops on the vast front south of Orel. At first, the Soviet army seemed to have a winning appearance in the area, but before the Soviet army reached the main German line, it was subjected to a fierce bombardment by German artillery, and the German infantry took the opportunity to counterattack and drive the Soviet army back to its original position. The battle is still in progress, and both sides continue to draw reserves to respond. According to a report from the German News Agency, the battle situation on the first day of the week can be described as follows: (1) The German positions on all sections are being defended, and the Soviet army has failed to break through anywhere. (2) German tank forces have not been used on a large scale. (3) German flat-firing guns have destroyed many Soviet tanks. Currently, while there are fierce battles on the ground, the German air force is also extremely active. It is reported that the Soviet aircraft lost a total of 122 aircraft on the first day of the week. According to last night's Reuters Moscow dispatch, German tanks have penetrated the Soviet line in two or three locations. One of them occupied two villages. The Soviet Information Bureau issued a communiqué at midnight yesterday, saying that on July 6, the Soviet army continued to fight against the strong German tank and infantry forces in the three areas of Orel, Kursk, and Belgorod.</p>
<h3>Large Air Battle Over Sicily - Allied Flying Fortresses Intercepted and Suffered Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Haitong News Agency, American Broadcasting Corporation special correspondent Budidet released a message last night, describing the battle over the Mediterranean Sea as a battle for air supremacy. He said that the Flying Fortresses that raided Axis targets in the Mediterranean theater often encountered strong counterattacks from Axis air defense forces. For example, when 30 American aircraft raided Sicily on Monday, they encountered 100 German and Italian aircraft in battle. Allied aircraft were also intercepted by 50 Axis aircraft in a battle on Sunday. The intensity of the air battle on Monday was unprecedented. Axis aircraft attacked Flying Fortresses fiercely, like a swarm of wasps.</p>
<p>Rome, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Stefani News Agency, the Allied Air Force fiercely engaged Axis aircraft three times over Sicily on Sunday. A total of 25 aircraft were shot down. The most intense battle occurred over the Catania plain, when a large number of four-engine American bombers, escorted by fighter planes, attempted to fly over the target in the area, but were intercepted by the Italian Air Force. 98 American aircraft were indeed shot down, and another five were largely destroyed, and 95 were heavily damaged. An air battle also occurred south of Cape Cesaro. A large number of Allied aircraft were dispersed. Five enemy aircraft were shot down in this battle, and another two were largely destroyed, and ten were damaged. Another team of Italian fighter planes intercepted 30 Allied twin-engine bombers protected by a large number of fighter planes, shooting down two enemy fighter planes and damaging one bomber and one fighter plane.</p>

<h3>Return of the French Concession in Shanghai - Authorities Conduct Negotiations - Chinese and French Officials Met Yesterday, Mayor Chen Spoke Cordially with Minister Chu</h3>
<p>Regarding the implementation terms and understandings of Japan's return of the Shanghai International Settlement, relevant Chinese and Japanese officials presided over the signing of the return agreement in the capital on June 20, and the National Government will implement the return on August 1. Foreign Minister Chu Minyi came to Shanghai from Beijing with Chen Guofeng, Director of the General Affairs Department, to inspect the situation in Shanghai, and it is reported that he also negotiated with the French side on the return of the Shanghai French Concession. Mayor Chen specially visited Minister Chu in the morning at nine o'clock for a cordial discussion. It is reported that they discussed the return of the French Concession and various issues related to the implementation of administration after the International Settlement was taken over for a long time.</p>
<p>Chinese and French authorities met once - Since Foreign Minister Chu Minyi arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the day before, the French Ambassador to China and the Consul-General in Shanghai also arrived in Shanghai on the same day. Foreign Minister Chu met with the French Ambassador once at 4:00 PM yesterday to negotiate the takeover of the French Concession.</p>
<p>Ling Xianwen's Broadcast Speech</p>
<p>Director of the Municipal Party Department Shen Yiwen broadcast on the Shanghai Broadcasting Station the day before, titled "After the Shanghai Settlements Are Recovered." He said in brief: "The Shanghai International Settlement will be recovered on August 1 this year with the help of our friendly nation Japan. Although the date for the recovery of the Shanghai French Concession has not yet been determined, our determination must be carried out, and we believe that it will be recovered in the shortest possible time. From now on, there will be no settlements in our country, and the century-old shame will be washed away in one day. However, there is still much work to be done and our responsibilities are exceptionally heavy, because Shanghai is not only an important commercial port in the country, but also a major city in East Asia, occupying a very important position politically, economically, and culturally. We must continue to work hard and actively, so as not to betray the meaning of recovering the settlements."</p>
<h3>The 41st Ration of Household Rice Will Be Restored to Two Sheng - 20,000 Stones of Suzhou Rice Will Be Shipped to Shanghai Soon, and Other Locations Will Continue to Ship</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Datong News Agency reporter: The Rice Distribution Office of the Public Works Department of the two settlements has decided to restore the 41st household rice ration to two sheng. Once the rice from outside the port is shipped to Shanghai, the deficit will still be supplemented. As for household flour, it will continue to be sold as usual from the 11th.</p>
<p>The Director of the Municipal Grain Bureau issued a statement - In recent days, the city's rice has risen in the black market, and all citizens are concerned. The Central News Agency reporter specially visited Zhang Xianzhi, Director of the Municipal Grain Bureau, at his official residence yesterday morning, and asked about the city's rice situation. He gave a statement, saying in brief: "Since the city's rice procurement and transportation were transferred to the Shanghai District Rice Joint Venture, the black market price of rice suddenly experienced an unprecedented surge during this transition, which is obviously the result of rice merchants making trouble and once again using their collection and hoarding branches to ignore people's livelihood, which is deeply distressing. An inspection of the city's rice supply shows that there is no shortage anywhere, and citizens can rest assured. All rumors are purely unfounded. The fact is stronger than rhetoric, and the rice supply will not be interrupted. 100,000 bags of rice from Suzhou, 20,000 bags from Yangzhou, and 30,000 bags from Huzhou will be shipped to Shanghai separately. The Shanghai District Rice Joint Venture is now actively engaged in expedited shipping. A telegram from Suzhou was recently received, stating that 16,000 bags of rice, totaling 20,000 stones, have been scheduled to be shipped today (8th) and can be shipped to Shanghai on the 9th. The remaining 84,000 bags of rice from Suzhou will also be shipped to Shanghai continuously, so there is no need to worry about the people's food in the urban area as the source of rice arrives."</p>
<p>Procurement procedures are gradually becoming smoother - A Commercial News Agency reporter quoted the person in charge of the Joint Venture as saying: "The first batch of rice, about 150,000 bags, is expected to be shipped to Shanghai today or tomorrow. The personnel sent by the company to purchase the rice departed separately on the 3rd of this month, and the main locations were Suzhou, Huzhou, Yangzhou, and other places. The rice could have been shipped to Shanghai earlier, but because the rice in various places was scattered in the suburbs, it took a lot of time to concentrate it, and it was also difficult to collect a huge amount of sacks for a while, and all the work was a first attempt, so it was delayed for four or five days. Now, the various procedures are gradually becoming smoother, and part of the rice has already been loaded on the ship and departed. It is estimated that the quantity is about 150,000 bags, which can arrive in Shanghai in the next two days.</p>
<p>It is also learned that 20,000 bags of rice from Yangzhou to Shanghai, of which 7,000 bags, according to a telegram from Yangzhou, have already been shipped.</p>
<p>Wheat purchase actively promoted - The reporter also learned from the Wheat Professional Committee that the association's work of buying wheat is also being actively promoted. According to the estimation that this year's wheat harvest is very good, and the new wheat in various places in Jiangnan has already been harvested, the estimated output of wheat flour in various places, in addition to local consumption, may be as follows (in thousands of dan): Suzhou 100, Wuxi 200, Changzhou 200, Zhenjiang 200, Nanjing 200, Anting 100, Danyang 100, Kunshan 100, Taicang 100, Jiading 100, totaling 1,400. In addition, the possible shipping volume from various places in Jiangbei is 3,000, totaling 5 million dan that can be imported from Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Investigate House Subletting Based on Baojia Household Registration</h3>
<p>The subletting licenses for the first half of this year in the two settlements expired at the end of June. All second landlords should renew these licenses for half a year and must obtain a renewal application form from the Public Works Department or the French Public Bureau before the end of June. It is learned that about 50,000 licenses were issued in the first half of the year, but the number of applications issued now is less than the above amount, so the authorities will send officers to investigate. The method is to record the names and housing locations of the second landlords who have not renewed their licenses, and then go to the Baojia office in that area to investigate whether their attached households have been canceled. If they have not been canceled and the renewal is delayed, they will be punished according to the Regulations on Subletting Licenses.</p>
<h3>Temporary Suspension of Moving Applications During Household Registration Period</h3>
<p>The Baojia authorities in the International Settlement have ordered all Lianbao to order all Baojia to re-fill the original household registration investigation form and send it out within a week. It is reported that the Changju Bureau in Xinzha and other districts has informed the Baojia chiefs that after reviewing the household registration, it is required to compile a new household registration book, but during the period of整理 this household registration book, applications for household migration will be temporarily suspended. After the整理 is completed, the collection will be resumed. However, this sorting period will last at most one or two days.</p>
<h3>Fourth Period of Cooking Oil Will Be Sold in Mid-Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cooking Oil Wholesale Office has already sold out the fourth round of cooking oil purchase with housing tax tickets for the three districts of Nanshi, Huxi, and Pudong at the end of last month. The two settlements and Zhabei and other districts have delayed in the handling of the goods, and the sales could not be carried out at the same time. According to the person in charge of the office, most of the cooking oil has been taken out of the warehouses and distributed to the oil shops for retail sale. There is still a part of it that is being processed, and it can be sold generally around the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3>Shen Bao Cup Charity Donation Set to End Today</h3>

<h3>Thoughts on Unifying and Promoting Charitable Undertakings - Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Lüquan of the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association (3) The Ideal of Charitable Undertakings</h3>
<p>Based on the above-mentioned several issues and certain difficulties regarding the unified promotion of charitable undertakings, Lanting and others exchanged views and generally believed that unified promotion is indeed the path that charitable undertakings must follow in the future, and the sooner it is implemented, the more beneficial it will be to private interests. However, in order for unified promotion to be more than just a slogan, it is necessary to ensure that it effectively produces results, so that the unified promotion of charitable undertakings can develop smoothly, fill in the gaps in humanity, eliminate social misfortunes, and truly realize the ideal of "not only loving one's own parents and children," so that in the new society of the future, charitable undertakings will no longer be needed. The following points are the common ideals of Lanting and others, and they are willing to share them with those who have the Tao. They also hope that they can encourage each other:</p>
<p>First, the unified promotion of charitable undertakings does not depend on the laws and orders of the government authorities, but relies on widespread and in-depth publicity and explanation. Therefore, for this movement, it seems appropriate to start with Shanghai and gradually promote it to the whole country. In particular, it is hoped that major newspapers and opinion organizations will widely promote and encourage it. At the same time, those who operate charitable organizations and enthusiastic people from all walks of life should hold seminars on this movement, conduct individual research, publish opinions in newspapers, or provide opinions to relevant parties, so as to mobilize public opinion in the shortest possible time, launch a heated review, concentrate conclusions from all aspects, and seek the most accurate and perfect specific methods. We believe that the plans created in this way will definitely be more practical and powerful than those that a few people come up with at home through arduous thought. In this open discussion process, the above-mentioned issues and difficulties can also be resolved invisibly.</p>
<p>Second, for the unified promotion of charitable undertakings, the organizational aspect naturally requires a central organization. This central organization is the general authority for investigation, design, guidance, promotion, review, and supervision for the unified promotion of charitable undertakings in the future. Therefore, first of all, it must concentrate talent. It should not only recruit outstanding leaders and workers who are currently running charitable undertakings, but also recruit those who have previously achieved success and are rich in experience. At the same time, it should also recruit experts in investigation, statistics, design, and other fields from outside of charitable undertakings, so as to gather wisdom and pool efforts. Secondly, this central organization should receive strong assistance from the government and relevant authorities, but at the same time, the government should not interfere with personnel and internal affairs, except for providing necessary convenience in principle guidance and implementation work, so that it can fully exert its effectiveness. As for the original charitable organizations and their undertakings, they should be properly investigated to ensure that they are necessary for unified promotion and reasonable development. Those that should be expanded should be expanded, those that should be reduced should be reduced, and those that must be merged should be merged, so that the will of charitable undertakings in the future is concentrated, the power is concentrated, and no manpower, material resources, or financial resources will fail to exert their full effectiveness.</p>
<p>Third, in the practical work of unified promotion of charitable undertakings, the basic principle is to maintain the original work achievements of each charitable organization, and then promote certain particularly good working methods and methods of some charitable organizations, so that all charitable organizations uniformly implement them to improve work efficiency. At the same time, accept the experience and lessons of various charitable organizations that have been running charitable businesses for decades or even centuries, and establish the working guidelines and specific methods for promoting charitable undertakings in the future. It is also necessary to calmly review the errors and shortcomings of certain social organizations and the reasons for the failure of their undertakings, so that we can know what to avoid in future work. In terms of personnel, the original system of each charitable organization should be maintained, and any interference or changes should be avoided as much as possible, in order to achieve the practical effect of assisting various charitable organizations through unified promotion. What should be particularly emphasized is that charitable undertakings in the future must be proactive. Therefore, in terms of work, it is necessary to closely cooperate and cooperate with educational institutions, cultural institutions, and even various business sectors, no longer limited to isolated and passive relief work.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding fundraising, after unified promotion, it is natural to change the past practice of each going its own way and conduct organized fundraising under a unified and comprehensive plan. For example, on the one hand, determine fundraising targets based on actual needs, and on the other hand, adopt appropriate plans based on the strength of the people. In principle, it is "those who have money give money, and those who have strength give strength," so that in every fundraising event, no one does not give money or strength. The charitable fundraising methods of advanced countries are indeed worth emulating. In terms of individual fundraising, it is necessary to be universal, with no one not participating, and to be ashamed of not giving money or strength. In terms of fundraising for social organizations, companies, and factories, a progressive ratio donation method can be adopted, stipulating that each manufacturer should contribute one-thousandth of its annual net profit as a fixed donation for charitable undertakings based on the progressive ratio. Under unified and planned fundraising, the funding problem of charitable undertakings in the future, even if it cannot be immediately improved, will often not be as serious as it is now.</p>
<p>The above are the key points of the exchange of views between Tuan and others on this newspaper's "Charitable Undertakings Urgently Need Unified Promotion." Now we sincerely provide them to gentlemen of understanding, and we hope that all parties will launch discussions and generously give advice, so that charitable undertakings in the future can create greater achievements and more glorious records.

<p>Economic Circle Commentary</p>
<h3>Industrial Spirit</h3>
<p>Running an industry should have a vision that does not seek immediate profits, especially not seek exorbitant profits, and a down-to-earth step, especially listening to the environment. Then there is hope of success. We believe that running a factory today should have the following four spirits:</p>
<p>(1) Creative Spirit: It is not appropriate to imitate others in running an industry. It is even more inappropriate to stick to old methods. It is necessary to be creative, be able to use one's own mind and ability to seek new styles and new methods in order to surpass others and avoid falling behind.</p>
<p>(2) Scientific Spirit: All organizations, equipment, and technologies should strive for rationalization. In particular, there should be a spirit of scientific management. Everything should conform to scientific methods in order to modernize industry.</p>
<p>(3) Rule of Law Spirit: Running an industry should strive for the rule of law. There should be a spirit of the rule of law, eliminating personal likes and dislikes and the sentiment of relatives and old friends. If one is concerned about sentiment and does not follow the law, one will destroy public rules and regulations and jointly followed discipline.</p>
<p>(4) Enterprising Spirit: Running an industry should require constant efforts. One should not be complacent and fall behind. The operation of industry will retreat if it does not advance. If there is no spirit of courage and advancement to seek the development of business, one will undoubtedly be eliminated.</p>
<p>This is the spirit that industrialists today should have in common. The revival of Chinese industry during the war depends on this, and the development of Chinese industry after the war also depends on this.</p>
<h3>Japanese Economic Delegation Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday by Plane; Mr. Ogura Masatsune, the Head of the Delegation, Gave a Speech</h3>
<p>Mr. Ogura Masatsune and his party, members of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Economic Delegation, arrived in Shanghai by plane at 4:50 PM yesterday (the 7th). They immediately went to the Biao Zhong Pagoda in Dachaang Town, the Bahsien Garden, and the Shanghai Shrine to pay their respects. Then, they drove to the Cathay Hotel, where they were staying. At 8:00 PM that evening, Minister Tianji hosted a welcome dinner at the Broadway Mansions. Mr. Ogura, the head of the delegation, met with the press corps at the Cathay Hotel and gave the following speech:</p>
<p>We have long had the desire, as members of the non-governmental economic community, to visit China, have friendly talks with everyone, and investigate the current state of the economy. Today, the opportunity has matured, and we have fulfilled our long-cherished wish, which is a great pleasure. It is clear that the Chinese and Japanese people are neighbors and also of the same culture. Since ancient times, exchanges have been frequent. Since the modern era, Asian nations have called for resistance to the aggression of Western European countries in order to revive Asia. The cooperation between China and Japan has been inevitable. This has been advocated by the pioneers of the two countries, and the goal of those with unique vision in both countries has been to focus on this. However, due to various circumstances, it has not been successful, but has instead caused unfortunate events, which is deeply regrettable. Fortunately, Japan later clarified that its East Asian policy aims to build a new order in Greater East Asia based on the spirit of morality, with the three principles of anti-communism, friendship, and economic cooperation with China as the fundamental guidelines. In China, people of insight, led by Chairman Wang Jingwei, rose up and responded, defecting from Chongqing, expressing their determination to cooperate with Japan, save China, and move towards building Greater East Asia. Furthermore, in January of this year, they declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States, participating in the Greater East Asia War with Japan, sharing life and death. I cannot help but celebrate for the two countries and the hundreds of millions of people of Greater East Asia. In this way, China and Japan have resolved the long-pending issue of Sino-Japanese cooperation with facts. However, it is unprecedented in the history of Sino-Japanese relations that the two countries can cooperate to resist foreign enemies. However, this unprecedented fact is by no means artificial, but is the inevitable trend of history. Moreover, Japan took the opportunity of China's participation in the war to abolish the extraterritorial rights that had shackled China for a century and return the concessions. The mutual cooperation between the two countries in East Asia has taken a further step. As such, China and Japan are now working together with all of East Asia to carry out the Greater East Asia War and build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. However, judging from the nature of the current world war, if the Greater East Asia War is not won, then the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will be impossible, and if the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere cannot be built, then the people of Greater East Asia will never have any hope of happiness. However, whether it is war or construction, the economic responsibilities are very heavy, which is unnecessary for us to elaborate on. Therefore, we must fully recognize the facts of the times and cooperate economically as members of the non-governmental economic community, which is the most important thing. However, no matter how loudly we call for cooperation, if we ignore it in our hearts, then the result of the so-called cooperation efforts will become just lip service. Therefore, in order to achieve harmony, it is necessary to be respectful in communication and trustworthy in action, otherwise it will never be effective. The purpose of our organization of the non-governmental delegation here is nothing more than to express our congratulations to China on recovering the concessions, being able to break away from the British and American shackles that it has suffered for a century, and restoring the face of a new China, and to implement exchanges with the Chinese government authorities and the non-governmental economic community as members of the non-governmental economic community, so that Sino-Japanese cooperation will be further consolidated. We hope that you will give us assistance.</p>
<p>List of Economic Delegation Members</p>
<p>Head of Delegation: Ogura Masatsune; Members: Akashi Teruo, Nango Saburo, Kodera Gengo, Yoshida Seiji, Nakanishi Toshihiro; Staff: Fukuda Mikiyo, Izumiyama Sanko, Hamano Kyohei, Akutsu Kan'ichiro, Sekiguchi Takeo, Takagi Sotofu.</p>
<h3>Speech by President Tang of the General Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency): Tang Shoumin, President of the National General Chamber of Commerce and member of the Materials Control Review Committee, came to Nanjing to attend the fourth regular meeting of the Materials Control Review Committee. The reporter took this opportunity to visit Mr. Tang. He answered the various questions asked. The main points of his answers are as follows. Since the establishment of the National General Chamber of Commerce, the main commodity trade associations of the lower-level organizations in Beijing and Shanghai have been established one after another. There are currently 69 types that have been completed and reported to the association for record. Currently, the General Chamber of Commerce is working to popularize the control policy throughout the country. The establishment of the Wuhan Branch and the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Branch has been discussed in detail at today's meeting. In the future, the central and local control organizations will be complete, and the application will be more perfect. The office in the capital will be established within this month and is actively planning. As for the collection of wheat by the General Chamber of Commerce, there are currently 29 offices, which will be gradually expanded in the future so that large quantities can be absorbed. The loans for buying wheat have now reached 100 million yuan, so there is no need to worry about large-scale purchases. Furthermore, some trade associations have not yet been able to achieve perfection and exert their strength. This is because the establishment period was short, and although it has been three months, it is not easy to contact and negotiate. One of the reasons for this is that the person in charge lacks experience, but it is hoped that people from all walks of life will provide guidance from time to time, so that things can be done with half the effort and achieve results. Currently, the General Chamber of Commerce is subordinate to the Executive Yuan, and its organizational regulations are currently being revised. In the future, the organization will be strengthened. Regarding the issue of material exchange between Central China and North China, there is already a complete plan, but it is still under research, and a satisfactory method will be realized in the future.</p>
<h3>Research by Various Industry Evaluation Committees: New Countermeasures to Stabilize Prices; Strengthening the Organization and Hiring Experts as Committee Members</h3>
<p>The evaluation committees of the various industry trade associations in this city recently convened temporary committee meetings to resolutely implement the previously set price limits without any leniency. However, in order to increase the stock of goods in retail stores, they appealed to the authorities to allocate more materials for sale at limited prices. Currently, the evaluation committees of various industries, in view of the heavy workload in recent times and the urgent need to thoroughly investigate the sales situation of member stores, have strengthened their organizations, hired powerful people in the industry to serve as committee members or consultants, and sent letters to member companies to provide opinions for reference.</p>
<p>Setting up a Secret Complaint Box: According to a reporter from the Shanghai News Agency, the evaluation committees of various industries have, after careful consideration, implemented the evaluation work in accordance with the established steps and dispatched personnel to investigate the buying and selling situation and limited price lists of various member companies. However, it is inevitable that there will be shortcomings. In order to strive for smoothness and achieve effective results, secret complaint boxes have been set up at the entrances of various trade associations, allowing anyone to report violations. Any member of the association who sells goods without following the limited price or has other illegal activities can report the facts directly into the box. Once the investigation confirms that there is such a thing, the person in charge of the company will be summoned to publicly discuss the punishment.</p>
<p>Posting Notices: A notice is posted next to the secret complaint box, which reads: "To whom it may concern, This association, in accordance with the instructions of the authorities and for the welfare of the industry, has established an evaluation committee in accordance with the association's constitution. Since its inception, meetings have been held to evaluate and set price limits, which have been sent to the authorities for approval and forwarded to all member companies for unified compliance. It has been found that the price increase trend has become rampant again recently. This association is deeply disturbed by the news. However, in order to adhere to our original intention, we have to take effective measures. In addition to being happy to accept the goodwill contributions of all parties, we also hope for extra assistance in order to achieve success. At the same time, we especially hope that our member companies will abide by the regulations and not violate the law. We hope you will understand."</p>
<h3>Organizational Structure of the Cotton Industry Special Committee</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Cotton Industry Special Committee of the National General Chamber of Commerce has been devoted to the discussion of specific aspects of the cotton industry. Its internal organization includes a secretariat, three departments: the General Affairs Department, the Review and Investigation Statistics Department, and the Supervision Department, and two departments: the Cotton Department, which takes over the former Central China Cotton Control Association, and the Cotton Textile Products Department. A committee has been established to focus on researching, designing, purchasing, allocating, and increasing production, including the Cotton Committee, the Cotton Cloth Committee, the Cotton Yarn Committee, the Cotton Textile Committee, and the Processing Committee.</p>
<h3>Powder &amp; Wheat Special Committee Registers Certificates in Beijing</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Nanjing Office of the Powder &amp; Wheat Special Committee of the National Commercial Control Association completed the registration of applications for commissioned merchants from wheat businesses in various locations on the 7th, and will no longer accept applications. A total of seven applications for commissioned merchant registration were received and have been forwarded to Shanghai for approval. As for wheat businesses and sellers in the Beijing area, the Cereal Industry Association will compile and submit applications to the Nanjing Office for certificate issuance.</p>
<h3>200,000 Bags of Wheat to be Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Wheat, a staple food, has been purchased from various production areas since the new harvest, as the authorities recognize the importance of food during wartime. The Powder &amp; Wheat Special Committee, organized by Chinese and Japanese merchants, is responsible for the procurement and is provided with various forms of assistance. It is reported that the procurement work has achieved considerable success, with 200,000 bags of new wheat currently being collected in the production areas, awaiting shipment to Shanghai. The transportation permit is still pending approval. Meanwhile, flour mills in the city, such as Fuxin, Fufeng, and Huafeng, are actively preparing to resume operations as the new wheat is expected to arrive in Shanghai soon.</p>
<h3>Merchants of Various Industries Apply for Permits</h3>
<p>The National Commercial Control Association, in order to strictly control and prevent the outflow of important materials, previously issued a public notice stipulating that for 25 categories of goods, including automobiles and their parts, hemp and its products, sugar, cotton yarn, and cloth, those intending to transport them from the Yangtze River downstream areas to South China, North China, Mengjiang, Nanchang, Hankou, Jiujiang, and other places, must apply to the association for a transportation permit in advance. It is reported that merchants are now complying with this regulation and obtaining certification from their respective trade associations as members of the association. The transportation of these materials to the aforementioned areas remains brisk. However, the Material Movement Permit Office of the Commercial Control Association, upon receiving applications and supporting documents from merchants, will conduct a thorough review and issue permits only to those deemed qualified. No separate letters will be sent for notification. Instead, the permit numbers for the materials will be posted at the office entrance. Applicants can claim the permit by following the prescribed procedures if the numbers match the ones they have obtained in advance. Furthermore, the transportation permits must be returned after the materials have been transported and cannot be deliberately concealed or used as an excuse for other purposes.</p>
<h3>Four Banks Including Siming to Convene Board Meetings to Determine Restructuring Steps</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen financial institutions, the National Government promulgated guidelines on the 26th of last month to reorganize the four banks, "Siming, China General Chamber of Commerce, China Industrial, and China National Products", removing the Chongqing faction's influence and transforming them into purely commercial banks. Simultaneously, chairpersons, directors, and supervisors for the four banks were appointed separately, ordering them to proceed with the restructuring immediately. The registered capital of each bank was set at four million yuan. The original official shares held by the Chongqing faction will be taken over by the Central Reserve Bank and may be sold to merchants. It is reported that the first batch of directors and supervisors have been actively preparing for the restructuring after receiving the order. The China General Chamber of Commerce Bank and China Industrial Bank already convened their first board meetings on the 5th and 6th respectively, to determine the restructuring steps and appoint internal managers and assistant managers. Siming and National Products banks will hold board meetings today and tomorrow to proceed with the restructuring. It is said that the banks' operations will continue as usual during the restructuring period.</p>
<h3>Stock Market Trends</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks continued to plummet. Investors' confidence was already weak, and the gold price decreased, causing commodity prices to fall as well. New and old investors halted their activities, leading to a sharp decline in stock prices. Some buying activity occurred at the noon break, suggesting a potential stabilization. The department store sector experienced the largest decline, with Wing On, Sincere, China National Products, and Neiliansheng all closing near their lowest prices. Kwong Wah Department Store was relatively stable, while King Lun Shirts and Socks stood alone, rising nearly a yuan. King Fook was slightly depressed.

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Scolding</h3>
<p>— Ouyang Menglei</p>
<p>Openly "scolding", secretly "scolding", tearfully "scolding", with hidden daggers "scolding"... "Scolding" is everywhere, I almost suspect this is a world of "scolding people". "Scolding" when you encounter something unsatisfactory is like shouting loudly: "I'm coming, make way", because they don't discuss, so you "scold".</p>
<p>And so the more you "scold" the worse it gets. And the worse it gets, the more fiercely you "scold".</p>
<p>Perhaps sometimes you suddenly feel that all kinds of "scolding" don't help you much, and you yourself are "scolding" very hard. So you think like this, and say like this: "I won't scold people anymore", "I forgive everything"...</p>
<p>When you say: "I won't scold people anymore", it means: "They are still worth scolding, but I'm not happy to scold, that's all". When you say: "I forgive everything", it also means: "Others are wrong, and I am right", so you forgive them... How ridiculous it is, you moved the judge's mouth onto your own mouth, and put on subjective eyes, no wonder everything has to be "forgiven" by you.</p>
<p>So how can we correctly avoid inappropriate "scolding"?</p>
<p>We should always carefully think like this:</p>
<p>"Those people who are scolded by me in various ways, have I ever known them? Understood them? Comprehended them? What are the reasons why they are not reasonable? What are their difficulties? What are their shortcomings? How do they 'explain' themselves?" After thinking, it's worth trying to "put yourself in their shoes". Then you can discover them and me.</p>
<h3>Truly Happy People</h3>
<p>— Ji Chen</p>
<p>"Happiness" is intuitive, so ordinary people "seem" to understand what "happiness" is. However, it is very doubtful whether this intuitive "happiness" is truly "happiness". Part of it is just a momentary "stimulation".</p>
<p>Is seeking pleasure in brothels happiness? Is being addicted to gambling happiness? Is speculating and hoarding happiness? Is singing, dancing, and lavishly spending thousands of gold coins without being stingy... is that truly "happiness"? Of course not! I think these are not truly happy, they are the results of "sex maniacs", "money-grabbing maniacs", and "greedy maniacs"... These are just momentary stimuli, stimuli... that make their brains "numb". The result of this kind of behavior is nothing more than destruction, pushing oneself into a bottomless abyss.</p>
<p>Why do people "willingly degenerate", willingly run to the edge of destruction? Because they don't understand what true "happiness" is.</p>
<p>A truly "happy" person must first make others "happy"; then, when he feels comfortable and relaxed, he won't be awakened by the pangs of conscience and ruin his moment of pleasure. Because whoever bases his "happiness" on the suffering of others will never get true "happiness".</p>
<p>True "happiness" is expressed from the heart, and cannot be compared to external stimuli. Many people travel by car, live in high-rise buildings, and eat delicacies... everything is as luxurious as possible; outwardly they may seem leisurely and "happy", but we can also easily imagine their inner pain! Therefore, a truly "happy" person is definitely not one who thinks about how to enjoy themselves all day long; on the contrary, they are the ones who work hard and devote themselves to the welfare of society.</p>
<h3>Spark</h3>
<p>— Liang Yue</p>
<p>People often don't pay attention to the "small" things; in fact, a major event is brewed from a "small" thing; conversely, if you want to handle affairs, you must start with the "small" things. "A prairie fire starts from a single spark", don't forget this sentence.</p>
<h3>Chicken</h3>
<p>— Shen Shen</p>
<p>"Staff Officer Zhang, take them outside and, together with that person who colluded with the bandits, interrogate him severely. Tonight, you must turn over the weapons and reveal the bandit party, and await my disposal," Commander X said to a person in gray cloth standing next to him.</p>
<p>"Town Chief Li, let's go outside! Don't disturb the Commander anymore," Staff Officer Zhang said as he waved his hand to Town Chief Li and the others. So the three of them bowed ninety degrees to Commander X and exited the Commander's office. Staff Officer Zhang walked in front. The orderly outside glanced at the three of them coming out, and leaned over, whispering to Town Chief Li: "What's the matter? Is it settled? I'll come to your house tomorrow morning. I have something to tell you." Town Chief Li nodded, followed Staff Officer Zhang, and stood in another dark and low place that looked like a firewood room. In the corner of the room, Ah Kun was tied up with his hands behind his back.</p>
<p>"Town Chief Li! You were too agitated. What you said to the Commander just now was too boring. We are all on the same side. I don't want to implicate you." Staff Officer Zhang seemed like a good person, speaking to Town Chief Li in a caring tone.</p>
<p>"Staff Officer Zhang! This matter is really too embarrassing! The one surnamed Wu—referring to Ah Kun—is indeed so poor that he can't even get enough food, you can't squeeze oil out of a stone, and he's quite honest. We really can't bring ourselves to deal with this matter. I think it's better to ask Staff Officer Zhang to help us." Chief Lu couldn't help but interject first.</p>
<p>"Really! Staff Officer Zhang! You are from this area, even though we are distant neighbors. We are still fellow villagers. I have done so many unconscionable things in the past two years as this cursed town chief, I don't know how many times. Today this unit is leaving. They want this and that, tomorrow that unit will arrive. They want this and that. Wasting time and spending money doesn't count, and I still get scolded. Listen to what the Commander said just now, it's as if we are also colluding with bandits. They insist on handing over this, they insist on handing over that. This sin is enough for me. I don't want to be this damned town chief anymore. I've lived for more than fifty years, dying now isn't considered short-lived!" Town Chief Li had just been scolded, and remembering the past, he vented a burst of resentment.</p>
<p>"Town Chief Li's grievances are indeed enough to bear. But this time, the matter must be settled. Staff Officer Zhang! You are a fellow villager, please smooth things over, otherwise, if things get stiff, it won't be fun for anyone, and it might lead to someone's death, which wouldn't be good!" Chief Lu also felt a little impatient, and a fire of injustice burst out from the bottom of his heart.</p>
<p>"I understand very well. I don't really approve of this kind of thing either. But, I really have no way to say a fair word. If you don't do it, then there is nothing else to do; if you do it, then you will be fed up. To be honest, you two are not suffering too much as town chiefs. I have been in the team for a few months, and what I have seen and handled are too many evil things! Today is not the time to complain, we will have the opportunity to talk another day. However, today that person—pointing to Ah Kun in the corner of the room—I think it is better to settle the matter, otherwise he will suffer. He seems to be sick. And he can't bear hardship. What do you think?" Staff Officer Zhang seemed to be a bit self-righteous and unable to extricate himself, saying the above paragraph of words very sadly. (6)</p>

<h3>Sympathizing with Cheng Keguang's Family, Master Kuqi Generously Donates Relief Money</h3>
<p>Master Kuqi wrote yesterday saying, "I read in your newspaper that the artist Cheng Keguang was tragically killed four years ago, leaving his wife without support. She was overwhelmed with grief, and because of the family's poverty, she could not fulfill her responsibilities to her elders and children, and had no choice but to attempt suicide several times. Fortunately, she was rescued each time. This news is truly heartbreaking. As a fellow human being, I cannot bear to stand idly by. Therefore, starting from July of this year, I will donate one thousand yuan per month until June of next year, temporarily for one year, or possibly continue. I am sending a relief certificate to the Cheng family, please forward it. In the future, they can withdraw funds directly from the designated location. This small amount is just a token of my sincerity." Master Kuqi's generosity and righteousness are truly admirable. The relief certificate will be temporarily kept here. Please have the Cheng family provide a guarantor with a seal and a citizen's certificate to collect it from this office, to show our seriousness.</p>

<h3>Medical Guidance</h3>
<p>The weather is unpredictable, with frequent sunshine and rain, so people with colds and those with lung diseases often cough and spit blood.

The association will provide free service. The extremely poor can receive medicine. Clinic hours are limited to 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM. The location is the association on Shengmuyuan Road.
