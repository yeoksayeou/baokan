<p>社評</p>
<h3>民意與國是</h3>
<p>中國乃至東亞各國的最高政治理想，就是反乎歐美制覇意想的王道，而王道的具體表現，則必須是由『天視自醫民視，天聽自吾民聽』爲出發點，我閱古代歷史上堯舜之治，固然未能論定，然而文王八十里而治天下，延社八百餘年，一時國運昌隆文化發皇，推究其原因，要不外由於文武周公等創業的明君賢臣，一反殷紂及並世諾覇所爲，宣揚王道維新，換一句現代的術語，就是能够歟閱察民意的向背，以定其國是，於是兆憶婦心，陰勢昌盛。由此可知民意輿國是關係之密切，雖然在時間上有今昔之異，但是這種基本原則却是永遠不變的。爲此，我們曾經一再籲請當局尊重民意，創立吳意機構，以輔佐政府，推進國是，鞏固國家民族復興的基礎。可是，也許有一部份人，望文生義，認爲民意機關之創立，有重蹈英美所謂民民主主義政治的覆轍之慮，在這反英美戰鬥已經逼近決戰階段的今日，似乎不合時宜？這就是要不要民意機關的問題，至今還是存在着，首先値得加以研究。</p>
<p>誠然，英美式的所謂資本主義的民主政治，在二十世紀，已經走到末路窮途，破綻迭出，我們要謀政治修明，決不能再走這條冤枉路了，這一點，中山先生早曾昭示過。可是，同時要知道這是以民主爲軀壳以覇道爲靈魂的英美政治的失敗，絕對不能與尊重民意發揚民氣的王道政治混爲一談。相反的，我們正因爲反對英美式虛偽的，覇道的政治，更必須集中民意，團結民力，才能取得最後的勝利。在學理上，中山先生的民權主義以至整部三民主義，固然早曾替我們奠定理論的基礎，不僅國民黨員對於樹立民意機構，如常常默誦的遺囑中所示「必須於最短期間，促其實現」，就是其他人士，也都有相同的願望，似乎再不用螯述了。就從軸心國家全體主義的政理論與實踐而言，所謂「全體」，是「政治力之集中的表現」，正與我園「萬民歸心」的王道政　相合，至於實踐方面，爲了實現全體主義，首先就必須通過各種各樣的民衆組織與民意機構，一方面傳達政府的政令法令，一方面反映民衆的志願，然後才能集結民衆的精神與物質力量在政府的周圍，舉國一致，向勝利之途邁進。否則，空空洞洞的呼喊全體主義，正是反對全體主義的另一種形式而已。實際上，今日實行全體主義政治的各國，莫不有名符其實的民意機關，無論日本與德義，者把國是建立在民意之上，所以國家可以不必分心於嬰民心的防範，有如美國之對付罷工運動及英國之對付印度等處的叛亂。我們後此等事實去研究，可以更加堅定的說，爲了集中民意與團結民力，以鞏固政府，推行國是，只有大胆地樹立起爲各方久所期待的眞正民意機關。</p>
<p>接着要發生的問題，也就是今日我們所必須愼重研究的問題，是我們需要怎樣的民意機關？研究及解答這個問題，必須浴意幾個基本條件：第一，必須是優合中國的國情，三十多年來，我們嘗試過好幾盃苦藥，首先的十年，我們吃過試行歐美式議會政治的苦頭。第二的十年，我們更曾吃過「蘇維埃政治」的苦頭。第三的十年，我們還吃過一黨專政以至獨夫政漢苦頭。總而言之，三十年間的苦頭，是產生於不問國靑盲目嘗試內一點上！痛定思痛，我們再不能重複過去三十年的錯誤了！我們一定要針對自己的國情，採取最適當的辦法。第二，是必須顧全事實，這一點，也和上述情形相異，過去三十年我們又吃了徒騖理想不顧現實的苦頭，即以民意機關說吧，在學歐美的時期，只重形式，東拉西凑，結成國會，合成內閣，以國是爲兒戲。在模仿蘇聯的降代，以不管中國的工人階級發願到甚麼程度，也不間農民本身有無革命請要，依樣畫葫蘆的結成「工農兵蘇組埃」，同樣是不顧現實，以國是爲兒戲。至於後來的一黨專政獨夫政治，只知拾人牙慧，僞造民意，以萬禺爲奴馬，更令人痛心了。</p>
<p>現在我們要建立眞正的民意機關，就必須針對過去所以失敗之原因，適應國情。重視現實。最主要的是：第一，目前事實上不可能召開國民大會或國民會議，就絕對不發出這種政治支票，以重政府的信譽。第二，目前中國國情複雜，各階層的利害不盡相同，而政治上也確有各種黨派存在，因此，就不必空喊「一黨專政」，喊也無益，徒增紛擾，不如通過民意機構以吸收各方人才，在政府一元的領導之下推行國是。</p>
<p>因此，我們今日所需要的民意機關，必須是適合國情適合現實的，第一，它在職權上不是執行實際政治事務的機關，而是集中民意團結民力以輔助政府及監督政府推行國是的機關。第二，同時，我們所需要的民意機關，決不能是點綴政治形式的贅疣組織，也不能是單純供政府諮詢的顧問機關，而必須可以認眞反映民意，發揮民力，以便改善國是的機關。第三，右組織成份上，爲了實現上述兩點，就必須確實考慮以下幾點：（一）必須切實吸收來自民間，且爲民衆所信仰的各方面的人才，不能妄存門戶派系的偏狹心理；（二）現任官吏不能挿足於民意機關，同時，在朝黨的黨員人數也不能在民意機關中超過三分之一以上，使不失去民意機關的眞實性與純潔性。（三）民意機關的成員的選舉標準，應注重其在社會之資望，尤其是注重一般人民對他的信仰心，即是重視其過去的德業，其次才是政治上的學識能力等等，年齡，性別，以及過去的思想等，應不佔重要地位。</p>
<p>或許有人懷疑，在這樣的民意機關建立起來以後，會不會被少數野心家或異黨份子所操縱，因而掣肘政府的行政呢？我們可以明白的說，凡是眞正健全的政府或在朝黨，決不會發生這種疑慮的。因爲健全的政府與在朝黨，他們所害怕的，是在與人民中沒有聯系，是在人民對於政府的一切漠不關心，不是所謂野心家與異黨份子之作惡，而政府所迫切以求的，是能夠隨時明瞭民衆的疾苦所在，隨時明瞭民衆的意願所在，隨時聽到民衆對政府的意見與批評，隨時獲得民衆對於政府一切政策的關心與協力，及對於若干流弊與錯誤的指摘，因爲只有如此，政治墳有改進，而民意才會集中，國力才能團結，國是才得貫澈，只有眞正的民意機關，可以鞏固政府與民衆之聯系，少數野心家在這裏縱有陰謀，也不會發生作用，目前我們對外要協力友邦以爭取大東亞戰爭的最後勝利，對內要從速完成全面和平的實現。政府惟恐民間協力之不足，則建立眞正的民意機關以推行國是，實是當前刻不容緩的一件大事。我們不僅希望政府愼重考盧，早付實現，更祈望社會上各方面的先進，共爲政府籌思研究，使在未來新中國的歷史上展開最光明的一頁。</p>

<h3>泰國革命紀念日　駐泰日使發表談話</h3>
<p>盤谷廿三日中央社電廿四日爲泰國革命紀念日，日駐泰坪上大使，今特對此發表談話，大意謂，無論何事，欲有特別成就，即必須具有決心，以實力斷然行之。一國政體之重要改革，允非易事，非有誓死之覺悟，即不能期其有成。十一年前，於安南亞洲一角，貪圖苟安之暹羅，近則已以近代國家之姿態，而出現於世人之前，其於重整國家形態之餘，邇來無日不力謀內政之改革，或充實軍備，或促進文化向上，或擴張領土，其發展實可謂日新月異，一日千里。泰國於過去十一年間之發展，實其民族千年歷史上未有之事宜。十一年前之前月十四日，泰國靑年志士，難抑止其愛國熱情，乃毅然崛起，同志等幾越死綫，歷盡艱苦，終於獲得今日之光榮。此後在此等靑年政治家領導下之泰國國民，亦會重賭其國運，此即泰越戰爭及此次之大東亞戰爭，蓋大東亞戰爭之抑果，非勝利即爲潰滅，在此次戰爭，泰國國民，又得重賭其國運也。現在日本正與泰國共同爲解脫英美之壓迫賭國運而戰，此戰爭勝利，東亞各民族當能享受無窮之自由與繁榮，如萬一失敗，不但將再回到未撤廢治外法權前之黑暗時代，最少於五百年間，不得不成爲盎格魯薩克遜之奴隸，故謂東亞民族之運命，厥在此一戰耳，無論任何民族，欲興隆即須冒危險，無勇氣冒危險之民族，乃亡國之民族，實不足成其大事，於此吾人除對於十一年來在畢本首相領導下樹立偉大業績之泰國國民，表示敬意外，幷期泰國國民以其過去之勇氣，努力完成此大東亞戰爭云。</p>

<h3>美底特律城　黑人發生大暴動　軍隊出動彈壓千餘人被捕　礦工罷工仍未有解決之望</h3>
<p>里斯本二十三日中央社電　據昨晚此間所接消息，美國汽車業中心底特律城，經過去三十六小時之浴血衝突後，已於昨日在軍隊彈壓之下，恢復常態，是役共死二十三人，內二十人係黑人，激烈暴動份子之被捕者一千三百人，其中百分之八十五係屬黑人，昨日有戴鋼盔之聯邦軍隊，持來復槍與機關槍，乘卡車巡邏全市，重要戰時工廠區域，宣布戒嚴，其面積約佔三鎭，共有人口逾二百萬人，聞在暴動中受傷者，共的七百人，被軍警逮捕之一千三百人。根據密切根州長所宜布之底特律戒嚴條例，悉將嚴行懲處，因其會參加開槍及非法携帶武器。此項種族暴動，以昨晨達到頂點，當時軍隊會便用衝鋒隊多人，進攻黑人所佔領之建築一處，因黑人已將該屋化成堡壘，黑人數十名，均携有自動手槍，來復槍，與其他武器，拒絕向軍隊投降，並開槍抵抗，歷數小時之久。軍隊則以手溜彈與催淚彈進攻，後子彈告罄，始行屈服。在軍隊開到前，此項黑人，吿伏於獨有障碍物之窗口，見有白人，即行射擊，軍隊攻下此屋時，死黑人二，並有多名受傷，因暴動之關係，福利通用，及克雷斯勒各汽車工廠工人，昨晨多未赴廠工作，各廠之黑人工人，則全體缺席。統率軍隊之根塞少將，會警吿暴動份子，謂彼尙有兵士作爲後備，一有紛擾再起之微兆，即隨時可以趕來彈壓云。</p>

<h3>德蘇展開陣地戰　坦克車集團出動全綫空氣緊張　德軍會攻入唐納資東岸蘇陣地</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十三日中央社電　德蘇戰爭，自二十二日起，已進入第三年新階段，東部全綫各地，仍在展開激烈之陣地攻防戰，是乃夏季決戰之先兆。故全綫空氣頗爲緊張，茲綜合此間所接消息稱，德蘇兩軍於列寗格勒東部窩爾霍夫地區，斯摩稜斯克東南方七十公里之基洛夫地區，東北方之庫爾斯克，西南一百三十公里之斯姆伊與比厄哥羅特東北方等各地區，不斷展開坦軍集團與機械化部隊這大規模遭遇戰，此外巴拉克內亞與伊鳩地區，德蘇兩軍亦曾展開空戰及陸戰，德軍經長時間之進攻後，已進抵唐納資東岸，攻入蘇軍主力陣地，對此蘇情報局二十二日則發表公報稱：（重創德軍後，已將其擊退）。此外別無確息，又據德國通訊社消息，窩爾霍夫地區德軍戰鬥轟炸機編隊，對蘇軍補給綫全面大施轟炸，時興邀擊之蘇軍戰鬥機隊展開空戰，已擊落蘇機二十九架，此外並日夜痛炸伏爾加河上游各地之蘇聯重工業地區云。</p>

<h3>德國戰時企業的姿態</h3>
<p>— 飯島正義　（二）</p>
<p>資材配給合理化</p>
<p>其次，如何分配材料呢？在過去，陸資動　計劃而受配給的機關常主張自己的使用權利，而想取得優先權，於是產生了競爭。自實施國家　理以來，研究適當的處置方法，在柏林設立軍需銀行，由四年計劃的次官開爾納，軍需大臣斯倍耶，及米爾希元帥三人，採合議制加以指導。陸海空三軍不用說，其他依物資動員計劃而取得使用權配給權者，皆須存款於這軍需銀行。各軍在軍需銀行存有存款者，給能向企業者方面發出軍需品的文件。受到這文件的企業視文件所需要軍需品的數量，向發文者要求所需要資材的數量。據此要求，各軍　軍需銀行通告討出自己的存款。受到付出通知書的軍需銀行，依其通告從存款簿上取出，而給予企業者以所需材料的購買證明書。如其軍需銀行規定發行購買證明書的期限，　收受亞講買證明書可完全獲得所需要的物資。關於交付購買證明書的時期，係由四年計劃長官指導之。這種態勞，使材料配給順利，因而重點企業得以有效地運營。</p>
<p>工作機械的活用法</p>
<p>就工作機械而言，德國對國內的不在運轉中的工作機械之調查，最爲注意，在各經濟地區，設有稱爲工業委員會的工作機械的調查機關。這是對工作機械的加工有非常能力的技術者組成的，不絕地輪流視察自己管轄下的各製造所。澈底的調查沒有不完活動着機械嗎？沒有儘量使用可以高度利用的機械嗎？這　種不盡妥善的場合。而把其結果報告於超然在陸海空三軍之外的軍需監管點。他　，在生產指導者的屬下，設屬「購買工作機械許可所」，同時在指導軍需品生產者的屬下設置「需要審查所」，極力防止工作機械的新創需要。第一，在企業者方面，如需要工作機械，向指導該產業的生產指導者申請購入機械。此時，需要審查所則審查有無不使用那種機械也可以達到目的的方法嗎？第二，使轉承包於其他有空閑機械設備的場所，審查防止機械的需要的方法。同時，軍需要監督廳調查具有空閑機械的工場，如有必要，得微用之，並命令其轉受保管。如除此一切場合之外，無法將空閑機械改裝而必須新的工作　　者。如　　　　。</p>
<p>如此，各企業始可向工作機械的生產指導員　下的購買許可所，申請購入。購買許可所如以爲與某　會社訂立契約購入認爲適宜者，予以承認。在指導工作機械的製造會社的指導員之下設　購買許可所者，即在禁止全體製造工作機械的企業任意生產機械。即爲購入工作機械而需要配給材料的憑單，不真　交付付於機械製造業者之手，工作機械指導委員交付購買證明書以交換這配給憑單，使兩者間依此而締結買賣契約的指導委員本身，以此　集的材料，再考慮將來的需要，對各機械製造業者指定製造的種類及數量，而配給材料。此時生的種類可以減少很多，可能範圍內減少同一製造所的品種，而增加生產數量。因此，德國工作機械的品種，減少約四分之一，戰前四千幾百種變成一千種左右。漸次減少類似的工作機械種類，而企業增加同一機械的生產品種。</p>
<p>勞務動員與能率維持策</p>
<p>至於勞力問題，如放任各企業自由，則其所需要的人員也勞必　無限制。因此，在每個經濟地區設置勞力使用監視委員會，適切的指導監督勞力問題。這委員會也由機械加工的技術者組成，視察調查屬下的全體製造所，澈底的調查空閑勞力或熱練工的實態，並如何適切的配　男女工員，而報告於各地方的勞動局。地方勞動局則依軍部的要求，召集被　　需要的男工。或在新說，擴充的工場中，命令被認爲不　要的熟練工改變職務。撤換熟練工。男工之後，配置　用工，女工，外人勞動者，及俘　等。所以雖國的全從業員數，戰前和今日曾無很大的差別，但在　業上則低下了。</p>
<p>用這　的低下的從業員來維持生產能率，各製造所的生產技術自然不會向上。生產技師因此苦心研究，分解工作，而移轉於罩能的作業，研究即使外行也能使用的單能工具或機械。使生產能率不致低下。極端的例，如部分品，製品的測定，檢查等精密工作，盲人也可以担任。或者使盲人也可以駛轉旋盤。（翔：譯自二〇七四號「束洋經濟」）</p>
<h3>德重轟炸機編隊　猛襲比塞大港</h3>
<p>柏林甘三日中央社電　德空軍強力重轟炸機編隊，甘日夜曾大舉空襲比塞大港，猛炸反軸心船舶，重創其驅艦二艘，商船六艘，（三萬五千噸），詳細戰果，迄今雖尙未判明，然據推定敵被毀之商船中，已有三艘沉沒，其他亦陷於長期間不能使用狀態。德國通訊社空軍記者弗萊太格少校，對此曾報道如次，德空軍此閃空襲比塞大港，因天氣良好，故均能迫近攻擊之目標，反覆施以澈底轟炸。最初有敵船二艘，中彈起火，并有六千噸級船三艘，亦中直擊彈據推定已沉沒，又七千噸級商船一艘，發生大爆炸，或已沉沒，此外四千噸級商船中彈後，即左右旋轉，似已受重創，此外並痛炸驅逐艦二艘，然因此塞大港內停泊艦船甚多，故德空軍之實際戰果，或較此更大云。</p>

<h3>德國對蘇作戰方策的轉變</h3>
<p>日本朝日新聞二十一日戰柏林專電，檢討現階段之德蘇戰局，已由中央社東京電轉錄大意，載昨日本報第三版。茲以原文比較詳盡，特爲全譯補刋，以窺全豹，尙幸讀者注意。－編者附注</p>
<p>（柏林守山特派員十九日發）六月已經過去半月了，在東部戰綫，兩軍嚴陣對峙，並無展開大規模攻勢的意向。雙方僅宣傳「敵方的大攻勢迫近了」，這宣傳說明雙方或許互相都在等待對方開始攻擊，或另有對峙的原因，德軍所視爲拿手的機動戰，自五月初旬以來，原可發動，但現已坐視這一個半月的貴重的「時間」過去，而無所作爲。</p>
<p>去年開始攻擊克爾赤半殲滅戰，塞伐斯托波爾的攻略戰。這二戰役告終後，南方主要戰綫開始真正的大攻擊的日子是六月三十日。今年或今後預料中的德國大攻勢，或將要等到那時候。這是判斷與去年不同的歐洲戰局外根本的變化正在微妙地起着作用的資料。這軍事的見地來看，去年僅爲東面戰綫的一面作戰，自是可能，但今年因自突尼西亞撤退的歐洲要塞，須隊備英美大軍的登陸，故形成了二面作戰。這時候，德國調集其全部力量至東部戰綫是否有利，殊難斷言。</p>
<p>一月卅日　第六軍在斯達林格勒遭遇全軍覆沒的悲境時，戈林元帥用充滿着憤怒的語調宣稱德軍的「夏季大攻勢」。但今日的情勢，北非已滿佈英美軍準備進攻，與當時比較起來，已有了相當的變化。除此軍事的情勢之變化外。另一極重要的現象，即德對蘇作戰方針，在政治方面正漸漸地在轉變中。那就是說，德國已重又開始從最初的出發點檢討「蘇聯所具的資源力」的限度，即蘇聯所有的土地，資源，人力，及其精神力的總和。以前僅擬用軍事力未解決東方問題，茲又從新的角度而摻入了濃厚的政治性。當此德蘇開戰第三年的紀念日，實爲極堪注意的問題。</p>
<p>德國所得的教訓</p>
<p>一九四一年六月二十二日，德軍突然開始攻擊蘇聯，當初其目標不單在打倒共產注義，並想根本的並永久的剷除大斯拉夫民族對歐洲的威脅，如其進攻幾個月後首都莫斯科即告陷落，則蘇聯內部到處將發生反政府的革命，預料赤色政權一舉即可自行崩潰。德國在一九四一年秋用最大的總攻擊以期佔領莫斯科，以及和一次夏季攻擊後立即準備實行東部占領地的政治組織，並把龐大的占領地編入德國版圖，這些事實，即爲其意　的表現。</p>
<p>然而經二年來反覆的夏冬攻防戰，以至今日，德國在如次諸點上，必須重行認識東部戰綫的事態即</p>
<p>第一，對於像蘇聯這樣持有龐大的戰力的敵人，使用閃電戰頗爲困難。</p>
<p>第二，因共產黨組織意外強固，德國雖獲得了極大的戰果，但蘇聯內部之政治的崩潰，仍不可期。</p>
<p>第三，占領龐大的地域，損失了大量的兵力，兵器，確爲蘇聯所受的相當的打擊，但不能以此即視爲蘇聯的抗戰力已趨低下</p>
<p>第四，蘇聯的共產主義之獨裁組織，對個人的生命財產並不加以何等考慮，爲澈底進行凄慘的近代總力戰，蘇聯實長最適宜的國家組織。</p>
<p>第五，斯拉夫民族所具的亞洲的性格，與歐洲不同，且這新的蘇聯民族的性格，與俄羅斯固有的愛國心結合起來，於是紅軍將士遂具有歐洲人所難以理解的不可異議的戰鬥精神。</p>
<p>從過去二年的經騐中，獲得了上述的教訓，自然促使德國反省，今後德國對蘇作戰的新方針，無論在軍事上，政治上，當然都由於這反省而來。關雅趣此事，國社黨機關報「國民日報」曾於六月四日發表一篇題爲「轉換」的論文，這篇文章是東部戰綫的某從軍記者匿名所寫，率直地指出以前德國人對蘇觀念的錯誤，並暗示德國對蘇政策的轉變。其要點如下：</p>
<p>從軍事到政治</p>
<p>一九四一年六月，我們開始進攻蘇聯時，我們德國人用非歐洲的驚訝來揣摩在那裏所見到的土地，人，及其生活的一切。是以當時所到接踵而來的勝利報道「俘虜敵人數百萬，破壞敵戰車，飛機數萵架」時，任何人都不以爲這是左右歐洲運命，決生死存亡之凄苦的戰爭。我們的兵士也相信經閃電的進攻後，立即可以進入列寧格勒或莫斯科，但我們現在知道要統治這東方的大地域，如不有十二分的把握俄國的人，則完全是不可能的。　蘇聯兵士的作戰，遠逾我們所學習的關於戰爭的約束與習慣。有時，蘇聯某軍團開放二異，佈成無謀的陣形。向我方進擊，有時在完全被包團的情勢下拒絕投降，他們自己切斷自己的生命。有時，某負重的蘇聯兵士，盡其最後的力射殺。援救他的德國看護兵。</p>
<p>一九四二年夏　第二次攻勢開始時，德軍陸　占領塞伐斯　托波爾，羅斯托夫，高加縈，斯達林格勒諸都市，德國的後方，因這捷報而大爲興奮，我們東部戰綫的兵士們，因這時業已民占領敵的都事，而想到不能不進行以俄羅斯人爲對象的戰爭。俱在第二次攻勢中，所俘虜的敵人數量，與所占領的地域之廣大比較起來，極爲微少。斯達林把俄羅斯居民間根深蒂固的頑強性格，提高至「祖國愛的戰爭」。我們所到的地方。依然如狂般頑強抵抗。因此，紅軍在德國的第二次攻勢中，並示受到甚麼決定的致命傷，反因美國援助的武器及鳥拉爾。西柏利亞地方急增的軍需工業力的補充而取冬季攻勢。東部戰綫二年來的經過，我們不能不回顧到當時德國人對俄羅斯人的人性知道得太少了。但現在我們知道了俄羅斯人是怎樣的人，沒有表情，在俄羅斯人之堅固的面具後面，我們不要看那隱藏着的細織的感受性及豐富的人間性，這人間性超越於支配者及政治形態之上，任何時不變面不殘剩着，爲俄羅斯大自然的一部分，我們在此二年間，習得了應該用俄羅斯的尺度曾估計俄羅斯。中國的農民，雖去幾度被異種民族所支配，但仍超然存在，即其一例。所以我們的俄國觀將有很大的變化，但這變化是從過去的經騐而來，我們德國人必然地學得的解決東方問題之鍵。是否能使用這解決的關鍵而踏上東方建設的大道，這是我們德國將士所負的使命。</p>
<p>讚美日本政策</p>
<p>德報上載之文，一致以爲其背景是三月十六日以蘇聯降將鳥拉索夫大將爲領袖的「組織俄羅斯解放國民軍」的運動。德國新東方政策，因上次冬季戰的機會而加上了政治性。烏拉索夫將軍的運動，是否會發展到像中國國民政府的存在，全視今後的情勢以爲斷，但今日絕對不放棄反共產主義戰綫的德國人，如上所述，從政治力與軍事力二方面，在對蘇戰上，尋求新的解決方法。而我們日本人所深感興味者，以前德國人對於日本解決滿洲事變的方法，處理中國事變的方針，並此次日本所採的南方佔領地諸對策，從未不加注意，最近德國則非常關心而開始研究。尤以此次臨時議會開幕日東條首相的菲島獨立宣言，引起了德國言論界意料之外的反審，見到「日本的占領　統治方針」，深致鑽　，德國在東部占領地開始採用的諸政策，例如解消蘇聯式的強制功動，集團農業，承認土地私有，對投顧的蘇聯俘　準備授予土地，對蘇聯傷兵保障其生活，用德國國費重建破壞的都市村落計劃，解放受蘇聯政局所判決的犯罪者等等，都是德國對蘇新方針的實施。</p>
<p>總之，德國對蘇作戰方針，第一年在殲滅紅國野戰軍主力，第二年在佔領蘇聯的土地資源，在第三年度，共特徵在發動政治力。前途困難尙多的對蘇戰上，見到了新的方法。（翼譯：自六月二十一日西部期日是新聞）</p>

<h3>申報助學運動急進　毋社會熱望　各校函告獲助諸生成績特優　本屆亟待各界捐輸策勵</h3>
<p>第五屆申報助學金籌辦以來，承各界多方協助，漸趨進展，關於申請章則，除於七月一日開始申請時，發給助學金章程處，所有各項手續，隨時在本報揭布，希各生注意。</p>
<p>本屆助學情極迫切</p>
<p>歷屆本報助學金，承委員會陳青士·沈嗣良·陸高誼·聶靈瑜·趙宗預·諸先生之指示，辦理甄審考試手續，賴社會之贊助，幸未隕越。本屆辦理之初，適值各校暑期卒業及升學考試忙迫之際，故本屆委員會擬俟諸委員校務略告就緒之時，即行定期舉行，以本屆待助學生之眾多與迫切，而現時助金之不敷支配，除　請各界繼續捐輸，以期清寒子弟無失學之痛，優秀學子有造就之機外，所有本屆調查考試各事宜，俟委員會決定辦法，再行公告。</p>
<p>各生成績尚堪告慰</p>
<p>所可告慰於各界歷屆捐輸諸君者，即本屆各大中小學畢業生中，據受助學生各校函告，其成績特著優異者十分之七均屬清寒子弟，十分之三四係由本報撥付助金而得完成其階段之學業，本報於此（一）對於本屆大學畢業各受助學生，謹　請社會予以適當之工作。各生可即日書明略歷，及擅長何項工作，逕函接洽。（二）本屆中小學畢業受助各生，本報當儘先助其升學，撥發助金，以宏造就。</p>
<p>各業策勉印象深刻</p>
<p>四屆以來，贊助本報助學運動者普及於各階層，各界領袖，工商先進，乃至學徒工友小販慵婦，均慷慨捐助，或輸鉅款，或移壽婚，彌月交際宴飲之資，或提盈餘，或以書畫金石義賣，或節　菓，或　撲滿，或以狐裘及珍品親送來館，此種至高無上之德行，在各界原屬行其心之所安，在受助學子則所得之印象自益深刻，蓋優秀學生之刻苦習學，所受各界義舉之感動鞭策，或有甚於父兄之督責，較之富家子弟游蕩荒廢，父兄以朴作教刑兩不知　改者，其效果相去遠矣。</p>
<h3>本報答覆三事</h3>
<p>昨接受助學生多人來函，囑本報（一）體念時難，對請助學生從寬核准。（二）對各大學請助學生提早撥助，以便注冊預定座位，並囑本報以標語宣偉，顯請助金。本報茲謹爲答復如次：（一）從冠寬核准一點，清寒界限及其品行必須嚴格，歷屆成績優良，本屆偶以事故成績較次者，家境十分清寒者，父母亡故或未能接濟者，學校負責人認爲確堪造就者，自當從寬核准優給學雜費·（二）對大學生注冊定座，本報亦甚同情，蓋繳費遲到座位落後，顯然課堂之之瑕上富有在前，清寒在後，此種行列予純潔無青年精神痛苦自亦不少，往往前座學生估優等地位，反多心不在學，而切磋孜孜者，列入後座聽講，則受相當阻碍，依照各校注冊現行手續，本報當儘可能提早核撥助金，然此種缺點，同時希望實行此種注冊辦法之各校設法改良，勿以繳款先後爲標準，本報亦甚願富有子弟之材堪造就者，仍得列座前排，此中調整，惟各校衡酌情理爲之。至於呼顯助金，在各生深恐粥少僧多，難期普及，在本報則確信讀者於助學金文字之關心，一字一句或即可代表學子之點滴血淚，連日本報社論及紀述，均曾多方呼顯，此後仍當繼續爲之，幸而本報信譽得永爲各界所推許，則諸生求學之願，終可獲遂，蓋本報助金總額擴展之期待，良心之督責，更較諸生個人之希望爲廣泛，爲熱切好。</p>
<h3>停雲樓</h3>
<p>— 義賣盛况</p>
<p>停雲樓主辦之畫　扇面助學義會展覽會，自二十二日起至二十四日止，在大新公司四樓大新畫廳展覽三天，開幕後，因會中陳列書畫胥屬精品　故選購之人十分眾多，前日在忽忽兩小時間，已售出十餘萬元，下午參觀之人，尤形擁擠，倫社正誼社各携四萬元往定，本報陳社長亦定購多件，以示提倡。總計第一日共售得二十萬元以上，昨日更形熱烈，可見各界人士，對於助學情緒之蓬勃，及期望寒優秀子弟求學之迫切，俾異日得爲國家社會服務，免如今日有人材缺乏之憾，而諸名家不易求得之精品書畫，今可在會中任意選購，是以風雅之士，尢稱便利，茲出品人如唐雲·沈子丞·鄭石橋·周鍊霞·吳青霞·丁輔之·高野侯·董天野等，尤興奮萬狀，復趕繪若干頁，以補充售出之缺檔，且使後來者免向隅，會期祇有今日，仍望本報讀者踴躍往購，俾「助學運動」，卒底於成。</p>
<h3>金剛公司</h3>
<p>— 義舉</p>
<p>昨接金剛公司函云：『敝公司秉服務社會之旨，訂二十三日起，義賣三天，七月一日起義賣三天，均不除成本開支，提營業總數百分之十，捐充申報新聞報助學金，查敝公司此舉，尚是初創，意在抛磚引玉，喚使各　　聞風興起。』奮該公司此舉，足爲本埠各商號助學模楷，本報深致感佩，各公司行號不乏明遠，聞風興起，受惠學子豈淺鮮哉。</p>
<p>熱心捐輸</p>
<p>上海乳品廠利用完善設備，煉製安健兒及金獅牌國貨全脂奶粉，久著聲譽，該廠總經理朱海初高夢飛兪柏榮等，對於　善事業，贊助素力，最近除已捐助華北急賑四千元，交由本報轉致外，茲又慨捐本報助學金二千元，爲善不倦，謹爲伸謝。</p>
<p>昨收助金</p>

<h3>糧食政策新課題</h3>
<p>關於華中主要食糧米麥雜彀等搜買，其新機構漸見完備，預料不久的將來，　能見到效率。糧食問題的本身，至爲複雜，隨時有新的困難發生，茲指陳其實際問題，或可供當局者施策的參考。</p>
<p>我人第一須注意者，現今糧食價格，日日騰貴·米價不必說，即小麥，豆類等，亦莫不昂貴萬分·其原因雖多，而資金流入都市，泛濫活動，實爲主要之一種，未可忽視·</p>
<p>其次，由於資金流入都市之多，一般小銀行及錢莊等，都有設立收買獎產品新機構的想頭，例如嘉興，蘇州，無錫，常州，等地，不乏此種收入買機關，收買對象，大半爲食糧及土產品，此很易爲投機者所獨占，實非杞憂之論，如何加以限制，另立完備之收買新機構，爲必要之事。</p>
<p>再次，食糧收集，亦爲重要之物資問題，應求都市興農村交流之圓滑化，即農產品應提供爲工業生產品之原料，工業品以供農村之需求，相互爲用，才是最有效果的方法以，如果僅僅注意於消極的限止，成效一定不大的。</p>
<p>以上幾項，均爲糧食政策上之重要問題，未可等閒視之，最近商統會決定之小麥統買方案，內容完善，如規定同業者收買數量之登記，及禁止同業者之轉賣等，均爲良善的方法，很多參考的價值，今後物資交流金融強化實現，一般糧食問題，定將更多好轉，希望商統會聯營社及糧食政策之當事者，作進一層積極的努力。（節釋六月二十一日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>中儲釐訂華商銀行　交換票據清算辦法</h3>
<p>中央儲備銀行上海分行爲強化金融統制，於本月一日起被告接管本市銀聯會票據交換所辦理交換銀行之同業存款及會員銀行間之現鈔票據交換差額轉賑事宜，現已釐訂辦理華商交換銀行清算事務，及代收票據等詳細手續，規定辦法，分函各交換銀行查照辦理。茲將其辦法探誌如下：</p>
<p>中儲銀行辦理　華商交換銀行清算事務及代收票據等詳細手續規定辦法甲開立「交換清算戶」，（一）各交換銀行自六月一日起須在本行開立「交換清算戶」，由本行發給送款簿撥款單及同存支票，一送款簿專爲各交換銀行存入「交換清算戶」款項之用，二撥款單專爲各交換銀行支付「交換清算戶」款項之用，三同存支票專爲各交換銀行銷撥款單及返還退票金額之用。（二）各交換銀行自六月一日起發出之票據，對於現鈔及匯　不必再加區別以資統一。（三）各交換銀行開立之「交換清算戶」利率，按遍息二厘計算。乙收款（一）各交換銀行每日收入各項票據應分別處理如左：A交換銀行撥款單及本行本票應直接存入本行收入各該行「交換清算戶」賬，在每日下午五時前及週六中午十二時前均可照收，暈有特殊情形不及於規定時間內辦理者，得臨時商洽通融辦理，其於交換時間內并得持往交換所提出交換。B代理交換銀行撥款單，除仍舊持往交換所向銀聯會提出交換外，在交換時間內并可直接存入本行，代向銀聯會轉賑。交換銀行票據（撥款單除外）應在交換所提出交換，不可直接存入本行。代理交換銀行及往來銀行票據，應送往銀聯會委託代收，由該會製給臨時回單，此項回單應於每日營業終了時，秉送本行掉換正式回單，憑單列金額收入各該行「交換清算戶」賑，其因時間關係，當日不及辦理者，須於次日上午十一時前辦理完畢，收入次日賑內，仍照當日起息，逾時則與次日所收款項合併辦理，照次日起息，但此種票據在每日上午十二時前並可委託本行代收，直接存入各該行「交換清算戶」賑。三會員錢莊票據除照舊委託銀聯會代收外，並可於每日上午十二時前直接存入各該行「交換清算戶」賑由本行代收。（未完）</p>
<h3>商統會徵詢　各業產銷情形</h3>
<p>全國商業統制總會，爲求確切明瞭各業產銷情形，故特向各業加以徵詢，大致爲：（一）每日生產量。（二）成本及價格分：（甲）成本計算，（乙）擬訂合理之利潤，（丙）公定價格定　論理，（丁）有無其他辦法，（戊）現在市　之調查。（三）配給情形分：（甲）以前供求配給情形，（乙）配給標準及手續，（丙）應否改善配給之方案。（四）建議物資登記辦理方案。（五）需要商總會協助事項等。其餘項目，隨各業之情形增加之，是項徵詢表，已分發各同業聯合會及公會，據實照填呈報，以便審核。</p>
<h3>嚴格管理棉紗　商業登記月底辦竣</h3>
<p>紗號業同業公會，奉令限期辦理會員登記，以便管理而予統制，各業前往登記者甚踴躍，而不明登記手續者亦不少。茲經濟局已限於月底前登記竣事，該會昨再度通告各會員，迅即辦理登記，現登記表式與前略有變更，已填送之會員應重行填寫，亲填送之會員應迅速辦理，如會員不詳悉登記情形者，可逕往該會詢閱登記規程，又該公會憶訂定登記費及公費如左：（一）登記費照資本額每萬元（二元），書表費十二元。（無論資本大小）。（二）公費全四種，一·資本額在十萬元以下及十萬元者二百元，二·資本額超過十萬元以上。四十萬元以下五百元，三·資本額四十萬元以上。一百萬元以下一千元，四·資本額自一千萬元或以上者一千五百元。</p>
<h3>華股趨勢</h3>
<p>昨華股登峯直上，多已創新價，各方人心緊定，因金價等上升賞爲主要因素。又國紗市關係，紡織業之買風尤爲蓬勃，永安紡織·大生一三兩廠·榮豐等均向高峰挺進，信和紗廠買風已告平息，國信織造登場照票面竟升起五成，大中華織造忽爲買戶垂青，新豐·國光印染等均求過於供。百貨業永安挺升頗巨，新新·國貨·內衣及景福衫襪各見上升，景綸獨平。文化業中華又越一重大關，商務世界跟踵抬上，漲度殊難料及。新藥業買風亦起，中法新亞均各進展，五洲與中西亦挺。此外大中華火柴與南洋烟公司。閘北水雷與華商電氣無不昂騰。康元製罐買氣日濃，久安實業亦叩近大關</p>
<h3>簡訉</h3>
<p>金屬業同業聯合會，本令組織業已簿備就緒，於昨（二十三）日下午二時在上海香港路五〇號召開成立大會，出席代表九十六人，商統會代表兪期西，實部代表孫祖基等出席指導，討論會軍·推選理監事，計當　者理事長周仲慶，常務理事張蓮舫張浩如等廿一人，鄭良娥等監事十一人。</p>
<p>中央儲備銀行上海西區辦事處（靜安寺路地豐路）於三十一年六月二十四日開幕，一年以來，業務甚爲繁榮，且該行對同業及工廠金融之調劑，促進生產之復興，盡相當之努力，成績卓著，該行於今日召集全體員生，舉行一週紀念式，聞屆時錢副　裁等特親自蒞臨訓話，用以　勉</p>
<p>國華地產公司，資本收足五百萬元，日前開創立會，選舉寶麟庭爲董事長，李伯涵等爲常務董事，許冠羣等爲董事，張新初帶爲監察，聘徐昌　爲總經理·靜秋魏少庭爲副理，趙培堃徐淵等爲喪理，即日開始營業。</p>
<p>本市點心館業同業公會，自奉令籌組以來積極辦理同業登記入會事宜，同業前往登記入會者頗爲踴躍。惟有一部份同業不明實情，間有向酒菜館業申請登記者，實屬錯誤，該會已通告同業加以糾正，以免錯入公會而喪失應得權益。一面呈請主管當局　飭酒菜業公會，勿得濫收他業會員云，又悉：該會已定於明（二十五）日假座虞洽　路舉行成立大會。（未完）</p>
<h3>商統會與中日經濟關係　（二）</h3>
<p>— 栗本寅洽</p>
<p>商統會成立以　，中日人士之間，對於上面所解釋的商統會之業務，恐尙未準備積極協助，因爲各人的看法不同，所以心思不一，在日本方面的一部　人士，認爲商統會誕生後，我們在華日僑的所有業務，將不得已而後退，存着這種恐懼的心理。因之，就有所謂預先想法子，研究競爭辦法等的一種對抗意議，這真是叫人莫明共妙的怪事。</p>
<p>中國人方面也以爲趁商統會成立的機會，想把日本人所有的正當經濟關係業務，以好像收回國權的心理——爲各個的利害打算——居然想從日人手裏奪取日方的正當經濟關係業務。抱這種對峙態度者，商業界大有人在。前後兩種心理，都叫人不愉快。前者，日本人的場合，祇要他們認清事態的時候，這種偏見是容易糾正的，但是，後者，就是中國人的場合，提起此言，　於中國的有識者，深覺失禮。——可是這種意識，恐怕是出發於中國的國民性，我們提出此點，無非希望中國當道要留心善處。想到唐理事長的嚴明訓辭，可以認爲華方已經明白此點。這一點願意華方慎重將事，萬一稱有差誤，無異給予商統會前途一個障碍，牽連到將來的禍根，那是更不堪設想了。但願此說成爲杞人之憂，則彼此皆有厚幸焉。</p>

<p>這是一部悲劇，以藝苑中事作題材，所以曾一度題名爲「藝苑血淚」，後來才改名「囘春曲」。</p>
<p>這是一部叙述三個從藝男女喲一段三角戀愛曲折動人的故事，我飾演的，也就是這三角中的一角，劇本的構成「我認爲是目前影片題材中比較可以令人滿意的一部，因爲一般戀愛劇，大都俗氣得很。而「囘春曲」的叙述一段三角戀愛史，似乎不同凡響，値得鄭重提出的一點，是囘春曲裏的二個男和一個女的戀愛，彼此都是築在事業上，這點，的確是最可取的地方。</p>
<p>我想，「囘春曲」的劇本很好，導演劉瓊先生是那麼的努力用心，「囘春曲」也許還可以看看吧。</p>
<h3>評「紅顏鐵血」</h3>
<p>— 陸光</p>
<p>「紅顏鐵血」是張石川導演，周曼華黃河合演的影片，劇情叙述軍閥時代軍閥政客欺侮女性的事實，有正義的靑年，有機警的偵探，有緊張的情節，有恐怖的塲面，最後軍閥惡貫滿盈，血案破獲，眞相太白，完成大快人心的結束，全片始終抓住觀衆們的緊張的情緒。是一部迎合一般觀衆的影片。</p>
<p>張石川導演的影片，詳細介紹故事的經過，是他的特長，「紅顏鐵血」保持他的作風，明明白白的把故事在緊凑的分幕中告訴觀衆，衣二小時的映演中，觀衆可以知這一個曲折離異的故事。</p>
<p>「柳暗花明又一邨」的句子，可以用到「紅顏鐵血」，編劇金鑑，把故事寫成一步緊一步，一節緊一節，當偵探倪寳昌責駡喬良材的時候，一定以爲劇情告一段落了，可是「柳暗花明又一邨」等到去找尋奚綠菊急轉直下，偏偏人影不見，展開又一幕曲折的故事，這個驚人之筆、是「紅顏鐵血」最大的收穫點。</p>
<p>周曼華飾奚綠菊限於劇情，很少演戲機會，不過在演出的塲而中，演技有控制劇中人個性的方量。被逼不屈時憤怒的反抗情緒，有深切的刻劃，最後在案情明白後大聲的痛罵喬良材，一言一語，發揮急昂的表情，是她在全劇中最成功的演出。</p>
<p>黃河飾奚義方，完全俠客姿態，正義之氣，活躍衣優秀的演技中，開打塲面，英勇之至！飾局長的用起，演出公務人員的個性，恰到好處。飾喬良材的徐莘園。軍閥典型，全部暴露。飾倪寳昌的歐輝與飾馮守常的許午演技甚佳。</p>
<h3>影訊點滴</h3>
<p>「萬紫千紅」舞蹈部份，己於本月中句拍完結束，此　專拍戲的部份，大約下月初旬，即可與觀衆相與，東寳演員理正參加各方送別歡宴，甚爲忙碌，聞將與合作演華北賬災劇後，放洋東渡，嗣後。在國內欲覩陽春艷舞者，祗有衣「萬紫千紅」中得窺其驚鴻遊龍之翩翩姿態矣！</p>
<p>黃梅時節，天氣陰晴不定，「漁家女」蘇錫外景因之稽延。卜萬蒼在製片部命令第一廠將內景悉數拍完，再出外景。</p>
<p>岳楓之「黨人魂」因塲面偉大，服裝，佈景，這具，考據需時，現衣空擋中，先拍「天羅地網」，由高占非，　美雲余演，片中演述法律與人情間衝突之點甚多，且以華北旱災爲背景，藉以喚醒國人注意華北災情之嚴重生！</p>
<p>引新作「千量哀鴻」，由嚴俊，王元龍，白光主演，劇本現已提出，並擬赴蘇北拍攝，堤河工程以爲背景，片中描寫堤岸崩潰冲毀魚　，驚天動地之危險，現正聘請工程師設計，積極籌備開拍。</p>
<p>方沛霖是青波人，衣攝影塲指揮工作時，常常嘩啦嘩啦。有一天在收「萬紫千紅」魷福歌時，李麗華忽向衆人說：「正式收音了，阿方哥不要嘩啦嘩啦」，其時方沛霖並未出聲，乖乖的坐衣李麗華的背後。</p>
<p>韓蘭根在第一廠與東寳演員拍照相，東一張，西一張，不憚其煩，王引批評他的攝影藝術，是猢猻本色，像煞有介事。</p>
<p>東寳劇團歌舞教練矢田茂他最佩服李麗華的天才演技，十二日晚假座蘭心大戲院拍舞臺塲面時，攸竟雙膝拜倒李麗華舞衣之下，當時，把李麗華嚇了一跳，還以爲他是當衆求婚呢。</p>
<h3>高梨痕加入華影</h3>
<p>由港來滬之名導演高梨痕，業已正式加入華影，開始導演工作，其第一部新作爲「新生」男女全角黃河王丹鳳，內在徐家匯三角街四廠開拍。</p>
<h3>回春曲導演竣事</h3>
<p>有人曾這樣的批評過：劉瓊今日的地位，與戰前金燄的地位是一樣的，這話說得非常的中肯。</p>
<p>現在他是導演了，「囘春曲」一片，在自編自導自演的局面下，認眞地工作了兩個多月，他對每一塲戲，每一個鏡頭，每一個人物，均予以愼密的處理。</p>
<p>雖然在拍攝的過程中，全部工作人員曾接連工作了五六個通宵，可是大家却沒有一句怨言，精神不感到疲倦，反而意幹愈起勁。</p>
<p>「同春曲」就在這樣的工作情形下已全部攝竣，剩下的只是幾個零零碎碎的補戲鏡頭了。</p>
<h3>從滿洲到上海（三）</h3>
<p>— 橋本關霖</p>
<p>索回國寶</p>
<p>是早在二十年以郁的事。常我旅屠巴黎的時候，法國政府想向英國索取羅丹生前寄　與倫教市的加萊市民的鑄像，返還於巴黎。那事情後來怎樣，直至我囘國之前，似尙朱解決。</p>
<p>這是僅隔着一海峽的倫敦輿巴黎的問題。一個國家，怎樣對其本魚的翳術持右深切的關心。當時，遠非與藝術國相隔離的日本人所能想像。最近德國奉還了峻峨天皇的御影，這雖不單是藝術上的問題，但總是一件愉快的事。</p>
<p>一天，和中國飯店中熟議的中國人筆談那種事。我以爲在美國雖尙未見，但在英國，法國及其他各國的高昌吐魯蕃等的珍品，游來極應該返還亞洲。我並曾在僑日華人間所發行的會報之類的刊物中寫了一篇文章，談及此事。那時，聽說昭陸—玄宗皇帝的葬所—右名的八駿石刻，被想拿到美國去的時候，很右些中國人驚異而表示反對。後來雖即交還，但拿去了多久，拿去了多少，這都是傳說。吐魯蕃和墩煌的東四，不用說，是未經允許而蒙失敬的東西。</p>
<p>據在北京開商店的某骨董商的話，散佈於龍門或天門的石像大概都被中國軍隊　　　　　了。那買的人很冠冕，說是爲了軍隊的給養，那軍隊爲表示感謝起見，幷遣兵士護衛至安全地點。那大多是共陸黨系的軍隊，及如馮玉祥等軍閥的軍隊，因此，有很多東四裝載到外國去了。</p>
<p>我到歐洲去之前，關於日本的古代美術運出至外國的事，因　聞未博所以不敢揣想。我在紀行文中寫着那種事，並說：「一國的美術、須得在產生共藝術的環境中去咀嚼。去玩味一藝術是與其國土不可分的東西，衣海外見到日本的美術、似賣淫女般凄凉。」德國的問倫所藏的費煦的蒐藏品，以日本的佛像爲主。那時，勢佛像深盛興趣的我，特意在開倫下軍去欣賞。費煦的蒐藏品，在日本時即已聽到，頗爲有名，因是外國人所搜集的東西，故所見到的不能不祇是一部份。</p>
<p>中國人之間，此後並未再說起「亞細亞的東西復返於亞細亞」的話。事變前不多時，那種運動似曾一度興起，我這裏也有從中國方面送來的宣傳書。日本當局也時常發表日本沒有領土的野心。亞細亞的東西返還亞細亞，我想提議我們應該與中國提携，督促政府把被拿到英美去的許多古代美術品，用國民的力量收囘來。這不止是我個人的私願。</p>
<p>在上海快要囘國的前幾天、某中佐請我吃茶，從華懋飯店樓上以下面時，眼前正是十二月八日午前五時二十分擊沉英艦淸脫雷爾號的塲所。聽中佐的叙述，追憶當時，不禁熱血沸騰起來。一切畫題，存在於何處，事先是不會知道的。即在同一塲所，從自己的立脚點來看，隨着視覺的不同，景魚會有塋化的。譬如在自己的庭院中，因爲拔去了一顆樹，那時的樣子看起來就完全變了。翌日，我獲得許可而寫了一幅大略的寫生畫，第一我所看見的，衣那靠近露台最近的塲所月潘脫雷爾號沉沒的塲所之右，是屋頂有大鐘的建築物。衣各天午前五時的情形，四周還很模糊。我立刻魷想，那大鐘的指針應請明確地記住，那正是午前五時二十分。（異：譯自每日新聞）（完）</p>

<h3>Public Opinion and National Policy</h3>
<p>The highest political ideal of China, and indeed of all East Asian nations, is the "Kingly Way," which stands in opposition to the hegemonic intentions of Europe and America. The concrete manifestation of the "Kingly Way" must originate from the principle that "Heaven sees as the people see; Heaven hears as the people hear." While we cannot definitively assert the reality of the rule of Yao and Shun in ancient history, King Wen's governance of the realm from eighty square miles, which extended for over eight hundred years, marked a period of national prosperity and cultural flourishing. The reason for this, upon investigation, is none other than the enlightened monarchs and virtuous ministers like King Wu and the Duke of Zhou, who, in contrast to the actions of the tyrant Zhou of Yin and the hegemons of his time, promoted the "Kingly Way" and reform. In modern terms, this means being able to discern the support or opposition of the people in order to determine national policy. Thus, the hearts of the masses were won, and the nation flourished. From this, we can see the close relationship between public opinion and national policy. Although there are differences between past and present in terms of time, this fundamental principle remains eternally unchanged. For this reason, we have repeatedly urged the authorities to respect public opinion, establish institutions of public opinion to assist the government, advance national policy, and consolidate the foundation for national and ethnic revival. However, perhaps some people, taking the words literally, believe that the establishment of public opinion organs risks repeating the mistakes of so-called democratic politics in Britain and America, which seems inappropriate today, as the battle against Britain and America is approaching a decisive stage? The question of whether or not to have public opinion organs still exists and deserves to be studied first.</p>
<p>Indeed, the so-called capitalist democracy of the British and American type has reached a dead end in the twentieth century, with flaws emerging one after another. If we want to achieve political enlightenment, we must not repeat this misguided path. Mr. Sun Yat-sen had already clearly indicated this. However, at the same time, we must recognize that it is the failure of British and American politics, which has democracy as its shell and hegemony as its soul, that absolutely cannot be confused with the "Kingly Way" politics of respecting public opinion and promoting national spirit. On the contrary, precisely because we oppose the hypocritical and hegemonic politics of the British and Americans, we must concentrate public opinion and unite national strength in order to achieve ultimate victory. In terms of academic theory, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of Democracy, and indeed the entire Three Principles of the People, had already laid the theoretical foundation for us. Not only do members of the Kuomintang have to establish public opinion organs, as indicated in the oft-recited will that "it must be realized in the shortest possible time," but other people also have the same desire, so it seems there is no need to elaborate further. From the perspective of the political theory and practice of totalitarianism in the Axis countries, the so-called "totality" is "the concentrated expression of political power," which is in harmony with our country's "hearts of all people returning" in the "Kingly Way" politics. As for the practical aspect, in order to realize totalitarianism, it is first necessary to pass through various mass organizations and public opinion organs. On the one hand, they convey the government's policies and decrees, and on the other hand, they reflect the people's aspirations. Only then can the spiritual and material strength of the masses be gathered around the government, and the whole country can move towards the path of victory as one. Otherwise, empty slogans of totalitarianism are just another form of opposing totalitarianism. In fact, all countries that practice totalitarian politics today have genuine public opinion organs. Whether it is Japan or Germany and Italy, they build national policy on public opinion, so the state does not have to be distracted by preventing infant people, as the United States does in dealing with the strike movement and Britain in dealing with rebellions in India and elsewhere. After studying these facts, we can say more firmly that in order to concentrate public opinion and unite national strength to consolidate the government and promote national policy, we can only boldly establish a true public opinion organ that has long been expected by all parties.</p>
<p>The next question that arises, and the one that we must carefully study today, is what kind of public opinion organ do we need? Researching and answering this question requires attention to several basic conditions: First, it must be in harmony with China's national conditions. For more than thirty years, we have tried several bitter medicines. In the first ten years, we suffered the consequences of trying out European and American parliamentary politics. In the second ten years, we suffered even more from "Soviet politics." In the third ten years, we also suffered from one-party dictatorship and even tyrannical rule. In short, the suffering of the past thirty years has arisen from blindly trying things without regard to the national conditions! Having learned our lesson, we can no longer repeat the mistakes of the past thirty years! We must adopt the most appropriate method for our own national conditions. Second, we must take into account the facts. This is also different from the situation mentioned above. In the past thirty years, we have also suffered from pursuing ideals without regard to reality. Even with public opinion organs, in the period of imitating Europe and America, we only emphasized form, piecing together a parliament and forming a cabinet, treating national policy as child's play. In the era of imitating the Soviet Union, regardless of the extent to which the Chinese working class was willing to advocate revolution, or whether the peasants themselves had revolutionary demands, we formed "Workers', Peasants', and Soldiers' Soviets" in the same way, again disregarding reality and treating national policy as child's play. As for the later one-party dictatorship and tyrannical politics, they only knew how to pick up on what others had said, fabricate public opinion, and enslave the people, which was even more heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Now, if we want to establish a true public opinion organ, we must address the reasons for past failures, adapt to national conditions, and value reality. The most important thing is: First, it is currently impossible to convene a National Assembly or a National Conference, so we must never issue such political checks in order to maintain the government's credibility. Second, the current national conditions in China are complex, the interests of various classes are not entirely the same, and there are indeed various political parties in existence. Therefore, there is no need to shout empty slogans of "one-party dictatorship." Shouting will be of no use and will only increase turmoil. It is better to absorb talents from all parties through public opinion organs and promote national policy under the unified leadership of the government.</p>
<p>Therefore, the public opinion organ we need today must be suitable for national conditions and reality. First, in terms of its functions, it is not an organ for performing actual political affairs, but an organ for concentrating public opinion and uniting national strength to assist the government and supervise the government's implementation of national policy. Second, at the same time, the public opinion organ we need must not be a redundant organization that decorates political form, nor can it be a simple advisory body for government consultation. It must be able to genuinely reflect public opinion and exert national strength in order to improve national policy. Third, in terms of organizational composition, in order to achieve the above two points, we must carefully consider the following points: (1) We must earnestly absorb talents from all aspects who come from the people and are trusted by the masses, and we must not harbor narrow-minded sectarian prejudices; (2) Incumbent officials must not intervene in public opinion organs. At the same time, the number of members of the ruling party must not exceed one-third in the public opinion organs, so as not to lose the authenticity and purity of the public opinion organs; (3) The selection criteria for members of public opinion organs should focus on their prestige in society, especially the general public's trust in them, that is, emphasizing their past virtues and achievements, followed by political knowledge and ability, etc. Age, gender, and past thoughts should not occupy an important position.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people doubt that after such a public opinion organ is established, it will be manipulated by a few ambitious people or dissidents, thereby hindering the government's administration? We can clearly say that any truly sound government or ruling party will not have such concerns. Because what a sound government and ruling party fear is not having contact with the people, it is the people's indifference to everything the government does, not the evil deeds of so-called ambitious people and dissidents. What the government urgently seeks is to be able to understand the people's hardships at any time, to understand the people's wishes at any time, to hear the people's opinions and criticisms of the government at any time, to obtain the people's concern and cooperation with all the government's policies at any time, and to point out certain malpractices and errors. Because only in this way can political affairs be improved, public opinion concentrated, national strength united, and national policy implemented. Only a true public opinion organ can consolidate the government's connection with the people. Even if a few ambitious people have conspiracies here, they will not have an effect. At present, we must cooperate with friendly countries to win the final victory of the Greater East Asia War externally, and we must complete the realization of comprehensive peace as soon as possible internally. The government is only afraid that the people's cooperation is insufficient, so establishing a true public opinion organ to promote national policy is a major event that brooks no delay. We not only hope that the government will carefully consider it and implement it as soon as possible, but we also hope that advanced people from all walks of life in society will jointly plan and research for the government, so that the brightest page can be unfolded in the history of the new China in the future.</p>

<h3>Ambassador Gu Visited Chairman Wang Yesterday to Explain in Detail the Results of His Discussions with Various Authorities in Japan. The Return of the Shanghai International Settlement Will Commence Immediately.</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) Japanese Ambassador to China Gu Zhengzhi returned to his post on the 22nd and immediately paid a visit to Chairman Wang on the afternoon of the 23rd to explain in detail the discussions he had with government authorities during his recent return to Japan. He departed at approximately 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) Japanese Ambassador to China Gu Zhengzhi returned to Japan earlier this month for official business, where he discussed various important issues with Prime Minister Tojo, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, and other key government figures. After more than ten days, he safely returned to his post in the capital via Shanghai on the 22nd. He received reporters at his official residence at 2:00 PM on the 23rd. He made the following remarks regarding the revision of the Sino-Japanese Treaty and other issues: "My recent return to Japan for discussions with Prime Minister Tojo and relevant ministers was highly satisfactory, enabling me to accomplish the major objectives of this trip. The Japanese government's new policy towards China, the Central Authorities' views, and the opinions of all parties are now in complete alignment. Going forward, we will commence the implementation of various measures based on this correct and unwavering principle. The first issue to be addressed will be the return of the Shanghai International Settlement. The Shanghai French Concession will also naturally be included as part of this issue. This will allow the political power of the National Government to permeate the entire Greater Shanghai area. The issue of abolishing taxation rights within extraterritorial rights will be resolved by accelerating the abolition as much as possible in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty on the Exercise of Jurisdiction. The issues of consular jurisdiction and police power are also under study. The reorganization of Japanese policy companies will be implemented sequentially, with due consideration for the various relationships involved. Prime Minister Tojo's statement during the recent Diet session regarding a fundamental revision of the existing Sino-Japanese Treaty is stronger and more forceful than previous statements, and its significance is self-evident. As for the timing and content of the revised treaty, since it has not yet been formally discussed with the National Government authorities, it will not be announced for the time being. However, I am confident that these facts will be realized concretely in the near future. The existing treaties between China and Japan, as well as those concluded by Britain and the United States in an attempt to maintain their influence in East Asia, will undergo a transformation as a result. In particular, it should be emphasized that Prime Minister Tojo's special emphasis on the fundamental revision of the treaty as the centerpiece of this statement demonstrates that Japan's new policy towards China will advance even further, and the epoch-making progress in Sino-Japanese relations can be foreseen.</p>

<h3>The Japanese Military Authorities in North China Express Support for the North China Food Policy</h3>
<p>The North China Political Affairs Commission recently issued a public notice, stipulating that new grain will be purchased at the new price limit starting from June 21st. The Japanese garrison authorities in North China, recognizing the importance of solving the North China food problem, issued a statement at 3:00 PM on the 21st, expressing support for the North China food policy and clarifying the North China Japanese military's concern for the North China food problem. They also stated that anyone who violates the Chinese side's policies will be punished according to military law. The North China Japanese Military's statement and the attitude of the Embassy authorities' North China Price Cooperation Conference are both concrete manifestations of the Japanese side's active cooperation with the Chinese side's policies, which is noteworthy.</p>
<p>Statement by the Japanese Military Authorities in North China (Issued at 15:00 on the 21st) The North China Political Affairs Commission has made painstaking efforts to solve the increasingly serious food problem in North China, and fortunately, it has gradually achieved results, which is deeply gratifying. We particularly admire the enthusiasm of Chairman Zhu and all the others. On May 5th, the North China Price Handling Committee issued a public notice, stipulating that all those who possess grain must apply for registration and sell it at an appropriate price. On June 6th, the North China Political Affairs Commission issued a clear order to purchase according to the new price. All these measures show the authorities' determination to solve the North China food problem, and they are being gradually implemented. The Beijing Office of the Japanese Imperial Embassy in China also issued a statement in response to the Chinese side's policy, hoping that Japanese residents would cooperate as one. The Japanese military authorities in North China also believe that the current food problem is an urgent task to stabilize the livelihood of the people in North China, and the food problem has a great impact on the Japanese military's mission and the security of North China. Therefore, we are deeply concerned about its trends. Regarding the Chinese authorities' various food policies, we will not hesitate to give full support, and we will also provide as much assistance as possible in terms of procurement and transportation. At the same time, those who violate the Chinese side's policies or attempt to sabotage them, regardless of Chinese or Japanese nationality, will be severely punished according to military law.

<h3>After Premier Tojo Expounded His Beliefs, the Prime Minister of Thailand Sent a Letter of Thanks, Resolving to Complete the War and Strive for Final Victory So That East Asian Nations May Achieve Independence and Glory</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) Premier Tojo of Japan, in his policy speech at the 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Diet, stated that Japan would provide further cooperation to its ally, Thailand, to help it develop, and expounded the beliefs of the Japanese government. The Thai government and people were deeply grateful for this. Premier Phibunsongkhram of Thailand decided to represent the people and express his gratitude to Premier Tojo of Japan for his speech. On the afternoon of the 22nd, Thai Ambassador to Japan Direk Jayanama visited Premier Tojo at his official residence and presented him with a letter from Premier Phibunsongkhram.

The content of Premier Phibunsongkhram's letter and Premier Tojo's words of thanks are as follows.</p>
<p>Content of Premier Phibunsongkhram's Letter</p>
<p>I respectfully represent the people of Thailand in expressing my deep gratitude for the general policy speech that Your Excellency made at the Imperial Diet, which is in line with the current situation. If we Asian nations are still subject to the rule of foreign nations as in the past, then the development of Asia standing on the position of a civilized continent cannot be completed, and we have long hoped to ensure the independence and integrity of national sovereignty. Now, Your Excellency and the Japanese people have enabled the nations of Asia to achieve the glory of national independence, which is deeply appreciated by all Asian nations. As Your Excellency knows, we have been devoting all our efforts to cooperate with Your Excellency and the Japanese people in all aspects, and there is no doubt about this. I would like to take this opportunity to clarify to Your Excellency that the point in Your Excellency's speech regarding</p>
<p>is the point that the Thai people are most grateful for. The sovereignty and independence of the nation, and the future of the nation, are what we are most concerned about. The achievements of today are the foundation of the achievements of tomorrow. Now that Your Excellency has clarified the resolution to further assist Thailand's development, I am very optimistic and full of joy about the future development of the Thai people. We are also firmly determined to complete the war until final victory is achieved, so as to contribute to Your Excellency and the Japanese people.</p>
<p>Main Points of Premier Tojo's Reply</p>
<p>The Japanese government respects the sovereignty and dignity of Thailand, which is an unshakeable direction. We will continue to adhere to this policy to promote Japan-Thailand relations, which goes without saying. The purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to restore the original face of the nations of Greater East Asia. This is Japan's consistent and unchanging purpose, which is the same as the understanding that your country has gained based on my speech in the Diet this time. This objective will gradually become a concrete reality as the war progresses. The Japanese government appreciates Thailand's sincere cooperation with Japan and Thailand's long-cherished aspirations, so we have made clear our determination to provide further cooperation to Thailand this time, and we will gradually strive to make it a concrete reality.</p>
<h3>Thailand Revolution Memorial Day: Speech by Japanese Ambassador to Thailand</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 23rd (Central News Agency) - On the occasion of Thailand's Revolution Memorial Day on the 24th, the Japanese Ambassador to Thailand, Mr. Taira, delivered a speech, the gist of which is: For anything to achieve extraordinary success, it must have determination and be carried out decisively with strength. A major reform of a country's political system is no easy task; it cannot be expected to succeed without the resolve to die for it. Eleven years ago, Siam, in a corner of Asia, sought only to maintain the status quo, but now it has emerged before the world as a modern nation. In addition to reorganizing its national structure, it has been striving daily to reform its internal affairs, strengthen its military, promote cultural advancement, and expand its territory. Its development can be described as rapid and ever-changing. The development of Thailand in the past eleven years is unprecedented in its thousand-year history. On June 24th, eleven years ago, young Thai patriots, unable to suppress their patriotic fervor, rose up resolutely. Their comrades crossed the line of death, endured hardships, and finally achieved today's glory. Since then, the Thai people, under the leadership of these young statesmen, have also re-bet their national destiny. This includes the Thai-Vietnamese War and the current Greater East Asia War. The outcome of the Greater East Asia War is either victory or destruction. In this war, the Thai people must again re-bet their national destiny. Now, Japan and Thailand are fighting together to liberate themselves from the oppression of Britain and the United States, betting their national destiny. If this war is victorious, all the peoples of East Asia will be able to enjoy infinite freedom and prosperity. If it fails, not only will they return to the dark ages before the abolition of extraterritoriality, but they will also become slaves of the Anglo-Saxons for at least five hundred years. Therefore, the fate of the East Asian peoples rests on this one battle. Any nation that wishes to prosper must take risks. A nation that does not have the courage to take risks is a nation doomed to perish and is not capable of accomplishing great things. Therefore, we not only express our respect to the Thai people, who have established great achievements under the leadership of Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram for the past eleven years, but also hope that the Thai people will use their past courage to strive to complete this Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Australian MP Proposes Vote of No Confidence</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Canberra, at the beginning of the Australian Lower House meeting on the 22nd, Mr. Nance, a member of the United Australia Party (Opposition Party), proposed a motion of no confidence in the government. Subsequently, Mr. Fadden, the leader of the United Australia Party, also severely criticized the government for "neglecting national affairs and engaging in politics" and demanded a vote on the motion of no confidence in the government. The main points of Fadden's attack are as follows: (1) Lack of administrative power due to insufficient ability and experience; (2) Unnecessary interference by the cabinet in the industrial sector, while neglecting strikes and other slowdowns in important military industrial sectors regarding constructive control; (3) Major failure in increasing food production; (4) Shortage of essential commodities; The current cabinet's improper policies have led to the precarious state of Australia's economic structure, and no clear direction has been established for post-war reconstruction. From the above points of attack, it can be seen that almost all aspects of the current cabinet's policies are inappropriate. However, this motion of no confidence in the government has not yet been put to a vote. The case has been discussed for twenty hours in the past and is scheduled to continue for another twenty hours.</p>
<h3>Bose Broadcasts to Germany and Italy, Vows to Cooperate with the Axis Powers to Defeat Britain and the United States and Strive for Indian Independence</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Indian patriot Subhas Chandra Bose, speaking from the Central Broadcasting Station here on the 23rd, broadcast appeals to the German and Italian people in their respective languages. The main points of his speech are as follows: (1) Main points of the broadcast to Germany: When I was in Germany, I had talks with President Hitler and other German government leaders, and therefore I was able to deeply understand that Germany is very concerned about the Indian issue and has deep sympathy for Indian independence. Germany is fighting against Britain, the traditional enemy of our Indian people. I know that the entire German people, even if they have to make any sacrifices, will strive to win the final victory in this war. No matter how much the enemy threatens and attacks Germany, they can never shake the firm determination of the German people. Japan, Germany, and Italy are currently maintaining a close relationship of complete coordination. There is no disagreement among the three countries regarding war objectives, as falsely speculated by the anti-Axis camp. Japan still possesses vast human resources, and its economic situation and food situation are very good. The abundant resources previously controlled by the anti-Axis side before the war are now being rapidly developed after being occupied by Japan. It is difficult for me to understand why the United States and Britain are still dreaming of victory. Finally, I sincerely extend my greetings to my fellow Indians residing in Germany and other European countries. The final victory and the freedom of the Indian people are as certain as the coming of daylight after the end of the night. It is about to arrive, there is no doubt. (2) Main points of the broadcast to Italy: This war is a struggle between two major groups of countries in the world, one maintaining the old order and the other building a new order. We are joining hands with energetic young people to move towards overthrowing imperialist countries. All the people of India have a duty to take up arms in this war to defeat British and American imperialism. I am convinced that the time has come for all the people of India to fulfill this duty. The spirit of the immortal Marshal Yamamoto is alive in the hearts of the Japanese people, which is the most reliable proof of achieving final victory. Here I would like to reiterate that all the people of India are determined to cooperate with the Axis powers to fight until the final victory is won.</p>
<h3>Son of Premier Ba Maw to Study in Japan</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Since Japanese Prime Minister Tojo made his statement, the gratitude of the Burmese people has reached its peak. Mr. Charlie (one of six siblings), the eldest son of Premier Ba Maw, who bears the heavy responsibility of Burma, has long aspired to study mechanical engineering. He will go to Japan to study aircraft manufacturing technology. After receiving permission from his parents, Premier Ba Maw is currently considering which school he will attend in Japan and will decide before his departure. The reporter visited Mr. Charlie at Premier Ba Maw's residence on the 22nd, and he said, "I am very pleased that my hope of studying in Japan has now been realized. This time, I plan to enter an industrial school to become an aviation technician to strengthen Burma's air defenses. I decided after discussing the situation in Japan with my father and hope to go to Japan to study as soon as possible."</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Attack Guadalcanal</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from San Francisco, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Command announced on the 22nd that Japanese air forces launched several attacks on the American positions on Guadalcanal Island on the 20th and 21st.</p>
<h3>Major Race Riot Erupts in Detroit, USA; Troops Deployed, Over a Thousand Arrested; Miners' Strike Still Unresolved</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to news received here last night, Detroit, the center of the American automobile industry, returned to normal yesterday under military suppression after 36 hours of bloody conflict. A total of 23 people died in the riot, 20 of whom were black. 1,300 rioters were arrested, 85% of whom were black. Yesterday, federal troops wearing helmets and carrying rifles and machine guns patrolled the city in trucks. Martial law was declared in the important wartime factory area, which covers about three towns with a population of over two million. It is reported that a total of 700 people were injured in the riot, and 1,300 people were arrested by the military and police. According to the martial law declared by the Governor of Michigan, those who participated in shooting and illegally carrying weapons will be severely punished. This racial riot reached its peak yesterday morning when troops used multiple platoons to attack a building occupied by blacks. The blacks had turned the building into a fortress, and dozens of them, armed with automatic pistols, rifles, and other weapons, refused to surrender to the troops and opened fire in resistance for several hours. The troops attacked with hand grenades and tear gas, and only surrendered after running out of ammunition. Before the troops arrived, these blacks ambushed at windows with unique obstacles and shot at any white people they saw. When the troops took the building, two blacks were killed and several were injured. Due to the riot, many workers at the welfare general, and Chrysler automobile factories did not go to work yesterday morning, and all black workers at each factory were absent. Brigadier General Ganse, who commands the troops, warned the rioters that he still has soldiers as reserves and can come to suppress them at any time if there is any sign of unrest.</p>

<h3>German and Soviet Forces Engage in Positional Warfare; Tank Groups Deployed, Tensions High Along the Entire Line; German Forces Attack Soviet Positions on the East Bank of the Donets River</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The German-Soviet War entered its third year on the 22nd, and fierce positional warfare is still ongoing along the entire Eastern Front, a prelude to the summer decisive battle. As such, tensions are high along the entire line. According to reports received here, German and Soviet forces have been continuously engaged in large-scale tank group and mechanized unit encounters in the Volkhov area east of Leningrad, the Kirov area 70 kilometers southeast of Smolensk, Kursk in the northeast, and the areas 130 kilometers southwest of Smui and northeast of Belgorod. In addition, air and land battles have also taken place between German and Soviet forces in the Balakleya and Izyum areas. After a long period of offensive, German forces have reached the east bank of the Donets River and attacked the main Soviet positions. In response, the Soviet Information Bureau issued a communiqué on the 22nd stating: (After severely damaging the German forces, they have been repelled). There has been no further confirmation. Furthermore, according to German news agencies, German combat bomber formations in the Volkhov area have launched a full-scale bombing campaign on Soviet supply lines. Soviet fighter squadrons have intercepted them, shooting down 29 Soviet aircraft. In addition, they have been intensely bombing Soviet heavy industrial areas in the upper reaches of the Volga River day and night.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Reuters reports: A British reporter who stayed in the Soviet Union for fifteen months told the London Daily Express yesterday that the equipment of the Soviet army is now better than before, and there is no need to fear German attacks. However, the Soviet Union's manpower is not inexhaustible. He believes that since the beginning of the war, the Soviet side has lost a total of 30 million people. This number includes men and women who have died, been injured, gone missing, been captured, or been sent to Germany to work, as well as those who have died from disease. The rations for soldiers are very meager, only two pounds of bread and ordinary vegetable soup. Soldiers hope to get better clothing, books, movies, and vacations in the future.</p>
<h3>Giraud Appointed Commander-in-Chief of French Forces in North Africa</h3>

At the same time, Tegor has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the French Forces in "other" territories. It is said that people from the Tegor faction are very disappointed that French North Africa is under the command of Giraud. The committee has not answered questions regarding who will command the navy, as well as who will govern Syria, French Equatorial Africa, French Upper Volta, and Madagascar.</p>
<h3>The Posture of German Wartime Enterprises</h3>
<p>— Masayoshi Iijima (II)</p>
<p>Rationalization of Material Allocation</p>
<p>Next, how are materials allocated? In the past, organizations that planned and were allocated materials often asserted their rights of use and wanted to obtain priority, which led to competition. Since the implementation of national management, appropriate disposal methods have been studied. A Military Supplies Bank was established in Berlin, guided by a consensus system involving Deputy Director Keilner of the Four-Year Plan, Minister of Munitions Speer, and Marshal Milch. Needless to say, the Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as others who have obtained the right to use and allocate materials according to the Material Mobilization Plan, must deposit funds in this Military Supplies Bank. Each military branch that has deposits in the Military Supplies Bank can issue documents for military supplies to businesses. Businesses that receive these documents request the necessary materials from the issuer based on the quantity of military supplies required in the documents. Based on this request, each military branch notifies the Military Supplies Bank to withdraw its deposit. The Military Supplies Bank, upon receiving the payment notice, withdraws from the deposit book and provides the business with a purchase certificate for the required materials. If the Military Supplies Bank stipulates a deadline for issuing the purchase certificate, the business can fully obtain the required materials upon receiving the purchase certificate. The timing of issuing purchase certificates is guided by the director of the Four-Year Plan. This attitude ensures the smooth allocation of materials, thereby enabling key enterprises to operate effectively.</p>
<p>Utilization of Machine Tools</p>
<p>Regarding machine tools, Germany pays close attention to investigating machine tools that are not in operation domestically. In each economic region, there are survey agencies for machine tools called Industrial Committees. These are composed of technicians with a high level of expertise in machine tool processing who constantly inspect each manufacturing facility under their jurisdiction in rotation. They thoroughly investigate whether there are any machines that are not fully active, and whether machines that can be highly utilized are being used to their full extent. In cases where there are imperfections, the results are reported to a military supervision point that is separate from the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Furthermore, under the production leaders, there is a "Purchase Permit Office for Machine Tools," and a "Need Review Office" is set up under those who guide the production of military supplies, making every effort to prevent the need for new machine tools. First, if a business needs a machine tool, it applies to the production leader who guides that industry to purchase the machine. At this time, the Need Review Office reviews whether there are ways to achieve the purpose without using that machine. Second, they review methods to prevent the need for machines by subcontracting to other places with idle machine equipment. At the same time, the Military Supplies Supervision Office investigates factories with idle machinery, and if necessary, it can requisition them and order them to be kept in custody. If, apart from all these cases, it is impossible to modify the idle machinery and new work is required, then. . . .</p>
<p>In this way, each enterprise can apply to the Purchase Permit Office under the machine tool production leader to purchase the machine. If the Purchase Permit Office considers it appropriate to enter into a contract with a certain company to purchase, it grants approval. The establishment of a Purchase Permit Office under the supervisors who guide machine tool manufacturing companies prohibits all machine tool manufacturing companies from producing machines arbitrarily. That is, in order to purchase machine tools, the vouchers for allocating materials are not truly delivered to the hands of machine tool manufacturers. The machine tool guidance committee delivers a purchase certificate in exchange for these allocation vouchers, and the guiding committee itself uses this to conclude a sales contract between the two parties. Based on the materials collected, it then considers future needs, designates the types and quantities to be manufactured by each machine tool manufacturer, and allocates materials. At this time, the types of materials produced can be reduced significantly, and the variety of products in the same manufacturing facility can be reduced to the greatest extent possible, while increasing the quantity of production. As a result, the variety of German machine tools has been reduced by about a quarter, from several thousand types before the war to about a thousand types. The types of similar machine tools are gradually reduced, and companies increase the production variety of the same machine.</p>
<p>Labor Mobilization and Efficiency Maintenance Measures</p>
<p>As for the labor problem, if each enterprise is left to its own devices, the number of personnel it requires will inevitably be unlimited. Therefore, Labor Use Monitoring Committees are established in each economic region to provide appropriate guidance and supervision on labor issues. These committees are also composed of machine tool technicians who inspect and investigate all manufacturing facilities under their jurisdiction. They thoroughly investigate the actual situation of idle labor or skilled workers and report how to properly allocate male and female workers to the local labor bureau. The local labor bureau, in accordance with the requirements of the military, summons male workers who are deemed necessary. Or, in newly built or expanded factories, it orders skilled workers who are considered unnecessary to change jobs or replaces skilled workers. After the male workers, it assigns apprentices, female workers, foreign laborers, and prisoners of war. Therefore, although the total number of employees in the country has not changed much from before the war to today, it has decreased in.</p>
<p>Using this decline in employees to maintain production efficiency, the production technology of each manufacturing facility will naturally not improve. Therefore, production technicians painstakingly study, break down work, and transfer it to skilled operations, and research single-skill tools or machines that even amateurs can use, so that production efficiency does not decline. In extreme cases, precision work such as the measurement and inspection of parts and products can be done by blind people. Or, blind people can be made to operate lathes.

<h3>German Heavy Bomber Formations Fiercely Attack the Port of Bizerte</h3>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Strong formations of German Air Force heavy bombers carried out a large-scale air raid on the port of Bizerte on the day, fiercely bombing anti-Axis ships, severely damaging two destroyers and six merchant ships (35,000 tons). Although the detailed results of the battle have not yet been determined, it is estimated that three of the enemy's destroyed merchant ships have sunk, and others are in a state where they cannot be used for a long time. Air Force Reporter Major Freitag of the German News Agency reported on this as follows: The German Air Force's blitz air raid on the port of Bizerte was carried out in good weather, so it was able to approach the target of the attack and repeatedly carry out thorough bombing. Initially, two enemy ships were hit and caught fire, and three 6,000-ton ships were also hit directly, and it is estimated that they have sunk. A 7,000-ton merchant ship also had a large explosion and may have sunk. In addition, a 4,000-ton merchant ship was hit and rotated from side to side, appearing to have been severely damaged. In addition, two destroyers were also bombed, but because there were many ships anchored in the port of Bizerte, the actual results of the German Air Force may be even greater.</p>

<h3>Tokyo Changes to Metropolitan System, to be Implemented Next Month</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Since deciding to change Tokyo City to a metropolitan system, Japan has started preparations and has now completed them all. It will begin implementation on July 1st. As such, the Japanese capital, the largest city in Greater East Asia, will reappear with the new appearance of Tokyo Metropolis. The appointment of the Governor of Tokyo Metropolis has been carefully considered by the Japanese government. Recently, Prime Minister Tojo approved the appointment of Mr. Tatsuo Ota, former Vice Minister of Home Affairs and current Mayor of the Special City of Syonan, as the Governor of Tokyo Metropolis. It is planned to announce the appointment at the same time as the implementation of the metropolitan system on July 1st. Before the announcement, he will be assigned to prepare for the establishment of Tokyo Metropolis.</p>
<h3>Change in German Strategy for War Against the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>A special dispatch from Berlin by the Japanese Asahi Shimbun on the 21st, reviewing the current state of the German-Soviet war, has been relayed in summary by the Central News Agency's Tokyo telegram and published on page three of this newspaper yesterday. Now, for the sake of a more complete understanding, we provide a full translation of the original text, hoping to attract the attention of our readers. - Editor's Note</p>
<p>(Berlin Correspondent, Shoushan, 19th) Half a month has passed in June, and on the Eastern Front, the two armies are facing each other, showing no intention of launching a large-scale offensive. Both sides are merely proclaiming that "the enemy's major offensive is imminent." This suggests that both sides may be waiting for the other to begin the attack, or that there are other reasons for the stalemate. The German army's favored mobile warfare, which could have been launched since early May, has now been allowed to pass through this valuable "time" of a month and a half without any action.</p>
<p>Last year, the attack on the Kerch Peninsula and the battle for Sevastopol were launched. After these two battles concluded, the day the main southern front began its real major offensive was June 30th. This year, or in the foreseeable future, the German major offensive may have to wait until that time. This is evidence that a fundamental change, different from last year's European war situation, is subtly taking place. From a military standpoint, it was possible to fight on only one side of the Eastern Front last year, but this year, due to the evacuation from Tunisia and the European fortress, preparations must be made for the landing of the British and American armies, thus forming a two-front war. At this time, it is difficult to say whether it is beneficial for Germany to concentrate all its forces on the Eastern Front.</p>
<p>On January 30th, when the Sixth Army suffered complete annihilation in Stalingrad, Marshal Goering declared in an angry tone the German "summer offensive." However, the situation today, with North Africa full of British and American troops preparing to attack, has changed considerably compared to that time. In addition to this change in the military situation, another extremely important phenomenon is that Germany's operational policy towards the Soviet Union is gradually changing politically. That is to say, Germany has begun to re-examine the limits of the "resourcefulness of the Soviet Union" from the initial starting point, that is, the sum of all Soviet land, resources, manpower, and its spiritual strength. Previously, it was only intended to use military force to solve the Eastern problem, but now a strong political element has been incorporated from a new perspective. The anniversary of the third year of the German-Soviet war is a matter of great concern.</p>
<p>Lessons Learned by Germany</p>
<p>On June 22, 1941, the German army suddenly began to attack the Soviet Union. Initially, its goal was not only to defeat communism, but also to fundamentally and permanently eliminate the threat of the Great Slavic nation to Europe. If the capital Moscow had fallen within a few months of its invasion, anti-government revolutions would have occurred everywhere inside the Soviet Union, and it was expected that the Red regime would collapse on its own. Germany launched its largest general offensive in the autumn of 1941 in an attempt to occupy Moscow, and immediately after a summer offensive, prepared to implement the political organization of the eastern occupied territories and incorporate the vast occupied territories into German territory. These facts are a manifestation of its intent.</p>
<p>However, after two years of repeated summer and winter offensives and defenses, Germany must now re-recognize the state of affairs on the Eastern Front in the following respects:</p>
<p>First, it is quite difficult to use blitzkrieg tactics against an enemy like the Soviet Union that possesses enormous combat power.</p>
<p>Second, because the Communist Party's organization is unexpectedly strong, although Germany has achieved great victories, the political collapse of the Soviet Union internally is still not to be expected.</p>
<p>Third, occupying a vast territory and losing a large number of troops and weapons is indeed a considerable blow to the Soviet Union, but this cannot be regarded as a decline in the Soviet Union's resistance.</p>
<p>Fourth, the Soviet Union's communist dictatorship does not take into account the lives and property of individuals in any way, and the Soviet Union is in fact the most suitable national organization for thoroughly conducting a tragic modern total war.</p>
<p>Fifth, the Asian character of the Slavic nation is different from that of Europe, and this new Soviet national character, combined with the inherent patriotism of Russia, has resulted in the Red Army soldiers having an indisputable fighting spirit that is difficult for Europeans to understand.</p>
<p>The lessons learned from the past two years have naturally prompted Germany to reflect on its new policy for war against the Soviet Union. Whether in military or political terms, it naturally comes from this reflection. Regarding this matter, the National Socialist Party's newspaper, "Völkischer Beobachter," published an essay entitled "Transformation" on June 4th. This article was written anonymously by a former military correspondent on the Eastern Front. It frankly pointed out the errors of the previous German view of the Soviet Union and hinted at a change in Germany's policy towards the Soviet Union. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>From Military to Political</p>
<p>When we began to invade the Soviet Union in June 1941, we Germans used non-European astonishment to speculate on everything we saw there: the land, the people, and their lives. Therefore, when the victory reports "millions of enemies captured, tens of thousands of enemy tanks and aircraft destroyed" came one after another at that time, no one thought that this was a bitter war that would determine the fate of Europe and decide life and death. Our soldiers also believed that after a lightning attack, they could immediately enter Leningrad or Moscow, but we now know that to rule this vast Eastern region, it is completely impossible without a twelve-point grasp of the Russian people. The combat of Soviet soldiers far exceeds the constraints and habits of warfare that we have learned. Sometimes, a certain Soviet corps opens up different formations and arranges a reckless formation, attacking our side. Sometimes, they refuse to surrender in a completely surrounded situation, cutting off their own lives. Sometimes, a heavily burdened Soviet soldier exerts his last strength to shoot the German orderly who rescues him.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1942, when the second offensive began, the German army successively occupied the cities of Sevastopol, Rostov, the Caucasus, and Stalingrad. The German rear was greatly excited by these victories. Our soldiers on the Eastern Front, because they had already occupied the enemy's capital, thought that they had to wage a war against the Russian people. Compared with the vastness of the territory occupied, the number of enemies captured in the second offensive was extremely small. Stalin elevated the stubborn character deeply rooted among the Russian residents to the "War of Patriotic Love." Wherever we went, there was still a frantic stubborn resistance. Therefore, the Red Army did not suffer any decisive fatal injuries in the second German offensive, but instead took the winter offensive due to the supplementation of weapons aided by the United States and the rapidly increasing military industrial power in the Ural and Siberian regions. After two years on the Eastern Front, we cannot but look back and see that the German people at that time knew too little about the humanity of the Russian people. But now we know what kind of people Russians are. Without expression, behind the firm mask of the Russians, we should not see the hidden delicate sensibility and rich humanity. This humanity transcends the rulers and political forms, and remains unchanged at any time, remaining as part of the great Russian nature. In these two years, we have learned that we should use the Russian scale to estimate Russia. Chinese peasants, although repeatedly dominated by different ethnic groups, still exist aloof, as an example. Therefore, our view of Russia will have a great change, but this change comes from past experience, and we Germans will inevitably learn the key to solving the Eastern problem. Whether we can use this key to embark on the road of Eastern construction is the mission of our German soldiers.</p>
<p>Praise for Japanese Policy</p>
<p>The articles published in German newspapers unanimously believe that the background is the movement of "Organizing the Russian Liberation Army" led by Soviet defector General Vlasov on March 16. Germany's new Eastern policy has added a political element due to the opportunity of the last winter war. Whether the movement of General Vlasov will develop into the existence of the Chinese National Government depends entirely on the future situation. However, today, the Germans, who absolutely do not give up the anti-communist front, as mentioned above, are seeking new solutions in the war against the Soviet Union from both political and military forces. What we Japanese find deeply interesting is that in the past, the Germans have always paid attention to Japan's methods of resolving the Manchurian Incident, its policies for dealing with the China Incident, and the various measures taken by Japan in the southern occupied territories this time. Recently, Germany has become very concerned and has begun to study them. In particular, Prime Minister Tojo's declaration of Philippine independence on the opening day of the recent special session of parliament caused unexpected repercussions in German journalistic circles. Seeing "Japan's occupation and governing policies," they deeply scrutinized them. The various policies that Germany has begun to adopt in the Eastern occupied territories, such as eliminating Soviet-style forced labor, collective agriculture, recognizing private land ownership, preparing to grant land to surrendered Soviet prisoners, guaranteeing the lives of Soviet wounded soldiers, planning to rebuild destroyed cities and villages with German state funds, and liberating criminals sentenced by the Soviet regime, are all implementations of Germany's new policy towards the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>In short, Germany's policy for war against the Soviet Union was to annihilate the main force of the Red Army in the first year, to occupy the land and resources of the Soviet Union in the second year, and in the third year, the characteristic is to launch political power. There are still many difficulties in the future war against the Soviet Union, and a new method has been seen. (Translated by Yi: The Western Period News is from June 21st)</p>

<h3>Su Yizhi Case; Hearing Held Yesterday Without Verdict</h3>
<p>The case of Su Yizhi, a female teacher at the Sacred Heart Elementary School, who was beaten to death by Liu Wangshi, the mother of student Liu Zhijun, was re-examined yesterday morning by the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The original defendants and witnesses made their statements. The police lawyer stated that the deceased had taken several tablets of gastric acid before the incident, which is noteworthy. It has now been chemically tested and no poison was found in the stomach. It is heard that the police believe that the circumstances of this case are serious and there are still several points that need to be investigated, so they requested a postponement. The court yesterday ordered Liu Wangshi to be detained and re-examined in seven days. The forensic examination report of Hou Guangdi has been disclosed, which considers that the rupture and bleeding of the left eardrum is proof of cerebral hemorrhage, and that death was indeed caused by the injury.

<h3>Reconstructing Caohujing Prison</h3>
<p>The Caohujing Prison in the western suburbs of Shanghai was large in scale before the incident, accommodating more than 2,000 inmates. The internal factory facilities and management were particularly strict, and it was known as a model prison. Unfortunately, since the incident, it was destroyed in a military mutiny. At that time, local order was not restored, and the timber doors and windows were all stolen, so it became desolate. The Ministry of Judicial Administration now intends to restore the prison. The Jiangsu High Court instructed the Shanghai Local Court to conduct a detailed investigation of the current situation of the prison, and draw a map of the four sites, and submit it to the court for transfer to the ministry for reference and preparation for restoration.</p>
<h3>Sanyou Sells Hangzhou Factory; Shareholders File Criminal Lawsuit</h3>
<p>The Sanyou Industrial Society of this city is a joint-stock limited company, founded in the first year of the Republic of China. Since the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, it has established a textile and dyeing factory in Gongchen Bridge, Hangzhou. The factory base occupies an area of 118 mu, and has purchased more than 20,000 spinning spindles, 750 wide and narrow looms, and 220 motors, totaling 1,500 horsepower. In addition, there are various machines for dyeing, finishing, sizing, and preparation. Before the war, the cost was 1.808 million yuan. Calculated at the current market value, it is huge. On November 19th of last year, Wang Yunfu and others, as directors of the company, sold the factory to Guohua Industrial Investment Company at a price of 3.8 million yuan in the name of the board of directors. Now, shareholders such as Shen Jiucheng have filed a criminal lawsuit. The trial was held at the First Special Court at 11:00 yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Wang Cheng. The plaintiff Shen Jiucheng, accompanied by lawyer Zhang Feixiong, and the defendants Wang Yunfu, Wang Jiazhen, Chen Wanyun, Zhang Wenkui, Jin Zongcheng, etc., and defense lawyer Wu Linkun, etc., were all present to be interrogated. First, the plaintiff's lawyer submitted evidence related to the case and stated the course of the case.

<h3>French Concession Has Held Zonal Drills; Summer Lighting Control</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that it is now summer, residents often like to open their windows wide to enjoy the cool, so the lights are fully exposed at night, which is contrary to the purpose of lighting control. The police authorities of the French Concession have decided that in late this month, the baojia in each district will, according to the order of the police station in each district, implement passive air defense lighting control in the form of joint guarantee units, especially focusing on arranging various tools to cover the lights to prevent emergencies.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>I have read the news in your newspaper on the 23rd about Wu Wenkui and others beating up market police officers, which involves our organization and is inconsistent with the facts. The market and the organization are originally one family, and there is no reason for the organization's personnel to beat up market police officers. Moreover, after searching our organization's membership roster, there are no such persons as Wu Wenkui and Xu Miaogen, which is obviously a false rumor. I am specially writing to request a correction, and I hope that the reasons will be published. Sincerely, Shanghai Special City Central Market Local Fruit Distribution Association, June 23rd.</p>

Xuhui's strength far surpassed that of Guangshi, and in a one-sided match, they defeated Guangshi by a score of six to one. The one goal conceded by Xuhui was due to a momentary lapse of attention by the goalkeeper, who inadvertently directed the ball into his own net. With a score of three to one in the first half, Xuhui ultimately secured the championship. Guangshi, with a record of seven wins, one draw, and one loss, will continue to battle with Zhongfa to determine the runner-up, with the match scheduled for 5:00 PM this Friday.</p>

<h3>The Shen Bao's Scholarship Program Advances Rapidly; Fulfills Society's Expectations; Various Schools Report Outstanding Academic Performance of Scholarship Recipients; This Year, Earnest Appeals are Made to All Sectors for Donations and Encouragement</h3>
<p>Since the launch of the fifth Shen Bao Scholarship Fund, it has received multifaceted assistance from all sectors, making gradual progress. Regarding the application regulations, in addition to distributing the scholarship regulations from July 1st, all procedures will be announced in this newspaper from time to time, and students are advised to pay attention.</p>
<p>The Urgency of This Year's Scholarship Situation</p>
<p>In past years, the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund, under the guidance of committee members Chen Qingshi, Shen Siliang, Lu Gaoyi, Nie Lingyu, and Zhao Zongyu, has handled the procedures for qualification review and examinations. Thanks to the support of society, it has fortunately not fallen short. At the beginning of this year's program, it coincided with the busy graduation and entrance examinations of various schools during the summer vacation. Therefore, the committee plans to hold the examinations at a set time when the committee members' school affairs are slightly more settled. Given the large number of students awaiting assistance this year and the urgent need, and the current insufficient funds for distribution, we earnestly request continued donations from all sectors so that impoverished children do not suffer the pain of dropping out of school, and outstanding students have the opportunity for achievement. All matters related to the investigation and examination for this year will be announced after the committee decides on a plan.</p>
<p>Academic Performance of Students is Still Gratifying</p>
<p>What is gratifying to those who have donated in the past is that among this year's graduates from major primary, secondary, and tertiary institutions, according to reports from the schools of the scholarship recipients, 70% of those with outstanding academic performance are impoverished children. Thirty to forty percent were able to complete their phase of study because of the scholarship money allocated by this newspaper. In this regard, (1) for the university graduates receiving scholarships this year, we respectfully request society to provide suitable employment opportunities. The students can immediately write a brief resume stating their expertise and send it for contact. (2) For the primary and secondary school graduates receiving scholarships this year, this newspaper will prioritize assisting them in continuing their education and allocating scholarship money to promote their development.</p>
<p>Impressions of Encouragement from Various Industries are Profound</p>
<p>Over the past four sessions, supporters of the Shen Bao scholarship program have come from all walks of life. Leaders from various sectors, pioneers in industry and commerce, and even apprentices, workers, vendors, and housewives have generously donated, either contributing large sums of money, or transferring funds intended for birthday, wedding, or baby full-moon celebrations, or offering profits, or selling calligraphy and paintings or antique seals, or saving fruit or piggy bank savings, or personally sending fox fur coats and valuable items to the newspaper. Such supreme virtue, for the various sectors, stems from their peace of mind, and for the scholarship recipients, the impressions they receive are even more profound. The diligent study of outstanding students and the inspiration and encouragement from the charitable actions of various sectors may even surpass the supervision of fathers and elder brothers. Compared to the wandering and wasteful habits of wealthy children, where fathers and elder brothers are ignorant of both gentle persuasion and strict discipline, the effects are vastly different.</p>
<h3>This Newspaper's Response to Three Matters</h3>
<p>Yesterday, we received letters from many students seeking assistance, requesting that this newspaper (1) consider the difficulties of the times and liberally approve applications for assistance from students; (2) provide assistance to students applying to universities earlier so they can register and reserve seats, and urging the newspaper to use slogans to highlight and promote the scholarship fund. This newspaper hereby responds as follows: (1) Regarding the point of liberal approval, the boundaries of poverty and their character must be strictly observed. Those with excellent grades in the past who have temporarily had lower grades due to accidents this year, those whose families are extremely poor, those whose parents have passed away or are unable to provide support, and those who the school authorities believe are truly worth developing will naturally be liberally approved for tuition and fees. (2) This newspaper also sympathizes with university students registering and reserving seats. After all, late payment and backward seating clearly imply that the wealthy are ahead and the impoverished are behind. Such a lineup inflicts considerable pain on pure and youthful spirits. Often, students in the front seats, who supposedly have superior grades, are more likely to be inattentive in class, while those who are diligently studying are placed in the back seats, facing considerable obstruction. According to the current registration procedures of various schools, this newspaper will do its best to allocate scholarship money earlier. However, we also hope that schools implementing this registration method will find ways to improve this shortcoming and not use payment priority as the standard. This newspaper also hopes that wealthy children who are talented and worth developing can still be seated in the front row. The adjustment of this matter is up to the schools to consider reasonably. As for calling for prominent donations, students are deeply concerned that there will not be enough to go around, making widespread assistance difficult. This newspaper firmly believes that readers' concern for scholarship fund wording, one word or one sentence, can represent the students' drops of blood and tears. Even the editorials and narratives of this newspaper have repeatedly called for prominent donations. We will continue to do so in the future. Fortunately, the reputation of this newspaper has always been trusted by all sectors, and the students' desire to study will ultimately be fulfilled. After all, the expansion of the total amount of the scholarship fund that this newspaper is expecting, and the conscience-driven supervision, are more extensive and fervent than the personal hopes of the students.</p>
<h3>Tingyun Pavilion</h3>
<p>— Grand Situation of the Charity Sale</p>
<p>The Painting and Fan Charity Exhibition hosted by Tingyun Pavilion, from the 22nd to the 24th, was held at the Daxin Painting Gallery on the fourth floor of the Daxin Company for three days. After the opening, because the calligraphy and paintings displayed were all exquisite, many people selected and purchased them. In just two short hours the day before, more than 100,000 yuan had already been sold. In the afternoon, the number of visitors was particularly crowded. The Lun Society and Zhengyi Society each brought 40,000 yuan to place orders. Chen, the president of this newspaper, also placed orders for multiple items to show his support. In total, more than 200,000 yuan was sold on the first day. Yesterday was even more enthusiastic, showing the vigorous enthusiasm of people from all walks of life for assisting education, and the urgent expectation of impoverished outstanding children to study, so that they can serve the country and society in the future, avoiding the regret of a lack of talent today. Furthermore, exquisite calligraphy and paintings by famous artists that are not easily obtained can now be selected and purchased at will at the exhibition, which is especially convenient for people of refined taste. The exhibitors, such as Tang Yun, Shen Zicheng, Zheng Shiqiao, Zhou Lianxia, Wu Qingxia, Ding Fuzhi, Gao Yehou, and Dong Tianye, are particularly excited and have repainted several pages to replenish the sold-out inventory, so that later visitors will not be disappointed. The exhibition period is only today, and we still hope that readers of this newspaper will actively visit and purchase, so that the "education assistance movement" can ultimately succeed.</p>
<h3>King Kong Company</h3>
<p>— Righteous Act</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received a letter from King Kong Company saying: "Our company upholds the purpose of serving society and has decided to hold a charity sale for three days starting on the 23rd, and for three days starting on July 1st. We will not deduct cost expenses and will donate 10% of the total sales to the Shen Bao News Scholarship Fund. We believe that our company's actions are just a beginning, intended to inspire others and encourage various industries to follow suit." The actions of this company are a model for local businesses to assist education, and this newspaper expresses its deep admiration. Many companies are discerning and farsighted, and if they follow suit, the students who benefit will be numerous.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Donation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Dairy Factory uses advanced equipment to produce Anjianer and Golden Lion brand national full-fat milk powder, which has long enjoyed a reputation. The factory's general managers, Zhu Haichu, Gao Mengfei, and Yu Bairong, have always supported charity causes. In addition to recently donating 4,000 yuan to the North China Emergency Relief Fund, which was transferred by this newspaper, they have now generously donated 2,000 yuan to the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund, tirelessly doing good deeds. We extend our sincere thanks.</p>
<p>Scholarships Received Yesterday</p>
<p>The list of scholarships received by this newspaper yesterday is as follows: Shanghai Dairy Factory, 2,000 yuan; Liu Dingxian (birthday celebration for mother, congratulations from friends and relatives), 500 yuan; Mrs. Li (sent by Pu Qiting), 250 yuan; Li Guipin, 200 yuan; Dahua and Rong Zhuhe, 50 yuan each; Zhang Qianfang, 25 yuan; Li Pinzhi and Li Yunchen (in memory of deceased brother), 20 yuan. Total received: paper money, 3,095 yuan. Remaining balance: 461,286.59 yuan.</p>
<p>Economic Circles - Course Discussion</p>
<h3>New Subject of Food Policy</h3>
<p>Regarding the collection of major food staples such as rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains in Central China, the new institutions are gradually being perfected, and it is expected that efficiency will be seen soon. The food problem itself is extremely complex, with new difficulties arising at any time. We now point out the actual problems, which may provide a reference for the authorities' policy implementation.</p>
<p>The first thing we must pay attention to is that the current food prices are rising daily. Not to mention the price of rice, even wheat, beans, and other categories are extremely expensive. Although there are many reasons, the influx of funds into cities and their rampant activities is indeed one of the main factors, which cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Secondly, due to the large influx of funds into cities, general small banks and money shops have the idea of establishing new institutions for purchasing agricultural products as incentives. For example, in Jiaxing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and other places, there are no lack of such income-buying agencies. The purchase targets are mostly food and local products, which are easily monopolized by speculators. It is not an alarmist theory. How to limit this and establish a complete new purchase mechanism is a necessary matter.</p>
<p>Thirdly, food collection is also an important material issue, and we should seek to streamline the exchange between urban and rural areas. That is, agricultural products should be provided as raw materials for industrial products, and industrial products should be used to meet the needs of rural areas. Using each other is the most effective method. If we only focus on passive restrictions, the effect will certainly not be great.</p>
<p>The above are all important issues in food policy, which cannot be taken lightly. The wheat unified purchase plan recently decided by the Commercial Control Commission has perfect content. For example, the regulations on the registration of the purchase quantity of the same industry and the prohibition of resale by the same industry are all good methods and have a lot of reference value. In the future, the realization of material exchange and financial strengthening will definitely improve the general food problem. It is hoped that the parties involved in the Commercial Control Commission Joint Association and food policy will make further active efforts. (Excerpt from the Continental News on June 21)</p>
<h3>Central Bank of China Devises Measures for Clearing Exchange Bank Notes for Chinese Banks</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen financial control, the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank of China took over the handling of interbank deposits of the Exchange Bank and the transfer of the exchange difference of cash notes between member banks by the Note Exchange Center of the Shanghai Banking Association from the 1st of this month. Detailed procedures have now been developed for handling the clearing affairs of the Exchange Bank for Chinese Banks and collecting notes on behalf of others, and the measures have been sent to each Exchange Bank for reference. The detailed procedures are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Detailed Procedures for the Central Reserve Bank to Handle the Clearing Affairs of the Exchange Bank for Chinese Banks and Collect Notes on Behalf of Others</p>
<p>A. Opening of "Exchange Clearing Account":</p>
<p>(1) Each Exchange Bank must open an "Exchange Clearing Account" in this Bank from June 1st, and this Bank will issue remittance books, allocation orders, and co-deposit checks. One remittance book is specially used by each Exchange Bank to deposit funds into the "Exchange Clearing Account". Two allocation orders are specially used by each Exchange Bank to pay funds from the "Exchange Clearing Account". Three co-deposit checks are specially used by each Exchange Bank to cancel allocation orders and return the amount of returned notes.</p>
<p>(2) The notes issued by each Exchange Bank from June 1st do not need to be distinguished between cash and remittances for unification.</p>
<p>(3) The interest rate for the "Exchange Clearing Account" opened by each Exchange Bank is calculated at 2% per annum.</p>
<p>B. Collection</p>
<p>(1) Each Exchange Bank should handle various notes received daily separately as follows:</p>
<p>A. Allocation orders of the Exchange Bank and this Bank's notes should be directly deposited into this Bank and credited to the "Exchange Clearing Account" of each bank. They can be collected before 5:00 PM every day and before 12:00 noon on Saturdays. If there are special circumstances that prevent the processing within the prescribed time, temporary consultations can be made to handle it. During the exchange time, they can also be brought to the Exchange for exchange.</p>
<p>B. Allocation orders of the proxy Exchange Bank, in addition to still being brought to the Exchange for exchange with the Banking Association, can also be directly deposited into this Bank during the exchange time and transferred to the Banking Association on behalf of the bank. Notes of the Exchange Bank (except for allocation orders) should be presented for exchange at the Exchange and cannot be directly deposited into this Bank. Notes of the proxy Exchange Bank and the correspondent bank should be sent to the Banking Association for entrusted collection. The Banking Association will issue a temporary receipt, which should be sent to this Bank at the end of each business day to exchange for a formal receipt, and the amount listed on the receipt will be credited to the "Exchange Clearing Account" of each bank. If it cannot be processed on the same day due to time constraints, it must be completed before 11:00 AM the next morning and credited to the next day's accounts, with interest still starting from the current day. If it is overdue, it will be processed together with the funds received the next day, with interest starting from the next day. However, these notes can also be entrusted to this Bank for collection before 12:00 noon every day and directly deposited into the "Exchange Clearing Account" of each bank.</p>
<p>(3) Notes of member money shops, in addition to being entrusted to the Banking Association for collection as before, can also be directly deposited into the "Exchange Clearing Account" of each bank before 12:00 noon every day and collected by this Bank. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Commercial Control Commission Seeks Information on the Production and Sales of Various Industries</h3>
<p>In order to accurately understand the production and sales situation of various industries, the National Commercial Control Commission specifically seeks information from various industries, which generally includes: (1) Daily production volume; (2) Cost and price breakdown: (A) Cost calculation, (B) Proposed reasonable profit, (C) Determination of official price rationale, (D) Whether there are other methods, (E) Investigation of the current market situation; (3) Distribution situation breakdown: (A) Previous supply and demand distribution situation, (B) Distribution standards and procedures, (C) Whether to improve the distribution plan; (4) Proposed plan for material registration; (5) Matters requiring the assistance of the General Chamber of Commerce, etc. Other items will be added according to the situation of each industry. This inquiry form has been distributed to various trade associations and guilds, which are required to fill it out truthfully and submit it for review.</p>
<h3>Strict Management of Cotton Yarn; Commercial Registration to be Completed by the End of the Month</h3>
<p>The Yarn Industry Association was ordered to handle the registration of members within a time limit in order to manage and control them. Many businesses went to register enthusiastically, but many also did not understand the registration procedures. Now, the Bureau of Economic Affairs has set a deadline for registration by the end of the month. The Association yesterday re-announced to its members to quickly complete the registration. The current registration form has been slightly changed from the previous one. Members who have already filled it out should re-fill it out, and members who have not yet filled it out should do so quickly. If members are not familiar with the registration situation, they can go to the Association to inquire about the registration rules. The Association also remembers the registration fee and public fee as follows: (1) Registration fee is 2 yuan per 10,000 yuan of capital, and the form fee is 12 yuan (regardless of capital size). (2) There are four types of public fees: 1. 200 yuan for capital under or equal to 100,000 yuan, 2. 500 yuan for capital over 100,000 yuan and under 400,000 yuan, 3. 1,000 yuan for capital over 400,000 yuan and under 1 million yuan, 4. 1,500 yuan for capital of 1 million yuan or more.</p>
<h3>Hua Stock Trends</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Hua stocks rose sharply and many have innovated prices. People from all sides are tight with confidence, because the rise in gold prices and other rewards is the main factor. The relationship in the national yarn market has made the buying style of the textile industry especially exuberant, and Yong'an Textile, Dasheng first, third and second factories, and Rongfeng have all advanced to the peak. The buying style of Xinnuo Yarn Factory has calmed down, and Guoxin Weaving's debut has risen by 50% of the face value. Da Zhonghua Weaving suddenly favored by buyers, and Xinfeng and Guoguang Printing and Dyeing are all in short supply. In the department store industry, Yong'an has risen quite a bit, and Xinxin, Guohuo, underwear and Jingfu shirts and socks have all seen rises, while Jinglun is alone. In the cultural industry, Zhonghua has crossed another major barrier, and Commerce and World followed suit, and the increase is difficult to predict. The buying style of the new pharmaceutical industry has also risen, and Zhongfa and Xinya have made progress, and Wuzhou and Zhongxi have also risen. In addition, Da Zhonghua Matches and Nanyang Tobacco Company. Zhabei Underwater Thunder and Huashang Electric are all expensive. The buying interest in Kangyuan Canned Food is growing day by day, and Jiu'an Industrial is also approaching a major pass.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>The Metal Industry Association, which was organized under the order of the Ministry, has been prepared, and convened an establishment conference at 50 Hong Kong Road, Shanghai at 2:00 pm yesterday (23rd). Ninety-six representatives attended, and Commercial Control Commission representative Yu Qixi, Ministry of Industry representative Sun Zuji and others attended and guided the discussions, elected directors and supervisors, including Chairman Zhou Zhongqing, Standing Director Zhang Lianfang, Zhang Haoru and other twenty-one people, and Zheng Liang'e and other eleven supervisors.</p>
<p>The Shanghai West District Office (Jing'an Temple Road Difeng Road) of the Central Reserve Bank opened on June 24, 31st year of the Republic of China. For the past year, business has been very prosperous, and the bank has made considerable efforts to adjust the finances of peers and factories, promote the recovery of production, and have achieved remarkable results. The bank will convene all its staff today to hold a one-week commemorative ceremony. It is heard that Vice-President Qian and others will personally attend to instruct and encourage.</p>
<p>Guohua Real Estate Company, with a capital of 5 million yuan, recently held an founding meeting and elected Bao Linting as chairman, Li Bohan and others as standing directors, Xu Guanqun and others as directors, Zhang Xinchu as supervisor, and hired Xu Changzhi as general manager, Jingqiu Wei Shaoting as deputy manager, and Zhao Peikun and Xu Yuan as funeral managers, and started business immediately.</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Dim Sum Restaurant Industry Association was ordered to prepare for the organization, it has been actively handling the registration of peers to join the association. Peers have enthusiastically gone to register and join the association. However, some peers do not understand the real situation, and some have applied to the wine and vegetable restaurant industry, which is a mistake. The Association has notified its peers to correct this to avoid mistakenly joining the association and losing their due rights. On the one hand, it has requested the competent authorities to order the wine and vegetable industry association not to indiscriminately accept members of other industries. It is also heard that the Association has scheduled to hold its founding conference at Yuqia Road tomorrow (25th). (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Commercial Control Commission and Sino-Japanese Economic Relations (2)</h3>
<p>— Kurimoto Tora</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Commercial Control Commission, Chinese and Japanese people may not yet be ready to actively assist in the business of the Commercial Control Commission explained above, because people have different views, so their thoughts are different. Some Japanese people believe that after the birth of the Commercial Control Commission, all the businesses of our Japanese expatriates in China will have to retreat, with this kind of fear in mind. Therefore, there is a so-called pre-thinking of ways to study competition methods and other adversarial ideas, which is really a strange thing that makes people feel inexplicable.</p>
<p>The Chinese also thought that taking advantage of the opportunity of the establishment of the Commercial Control Commission, they wanted to take all the legitimate economic relations businesses of the Japanese people with a mentality of recovering national rights - for the sake of their own interests - and actually wanted to seize the legitimate economic relations businesses of the Japanese from the hands of the Japanese. There are many people in the business world who hold this confrontational attitude. Both of these mentalities are unpleasant. In the former case, the prejudice of the Japanese is easy to correct as long as they recognize the situation, but in the latter case, that is, in the case of the Chinese, mentioning this is considered rude by the enlightened people of China. - However, this kind of consciousness is probably derived from the Chinese national character. We put forward this point in the hope that the Chinese authorities will pay attention to handling it well. Thinking of Director-General Tang's strict teachings, it can be considered that the Chinese side has understood this point. This point is willing to be cautious in doing things. If there is any error, it is tantamount to giving the future of the Commercial Control Commission an obstacle, involving the root of future troubles, which is even more unthinkable. I hope that this statement will become a worry, then both sides will be very fortunate.</p>

<p>Film Industry</p>
<h3>I Act in "Song of Rejuvenation"</h3>
<p>— Hu Feng</p>
<p>"Song of Rejuvenation" is being produced very smoothly and is now two-thirds completed.</p>
<p>This is a tragedy, with the affairs of the art world as the theme, so it was once titled "Tears of Blood in the Art World", and later changed to "Song of Rejuvenation".</p>
<p>This is a story about a tortuous and moving love triangle between three men and women in the arts. The role I play is one of the corners of this triangle. The structure of the script "I think is a more satisfactory one in the current film themes, because most love dramas are very vulgar. However, the narration of "Song of Rejuvenation" about a love triangle seems extraordinary. One point worth mentioning is that the love between the two men and one woman in "Song of Rejuvenation" is built on their careers. This point is indeed the most commendable.</p>
<p>I think the script of "Song of Rejuvenation" is very good, and director Liu Qiong is so hardworking and dedicated, "Song of Rejuvenation" may still be worth watching.</p>
<h3>Review of "Beauty's Iron Blood"</h3>
<p>— Lu Guang</p>
<p>"Beauty's Iron Blood" is a film directed by Zhang Shichuan, starring Zhou Manhua and Huang He. The plot narrates the facts of warlords and politicians bullying women in the warlord era. There are righteous young people, witty detectives, tense plots, and terrifying scenes. In the end, the warlord's evil deeds are full, the blood case is solved, the truth is revealed, and a satisfying ending is completed. The whole film always grabs the tense emotions of the audience. It is a film that caters to the general audience.</p>
<p>Director Zhang Shichuan's film, detailed introduction of the story's process, is his specialty. "Beauty's Iron Blood" maintains his style, clearly telling the audience the story in tight sub-scenes. In the two-hour screening, the audience can know this tortuous and bizarre story.</p>
<p>The sentence "The willows are dark and the flowers are bright, another village" can be used in "Beauty's Iron Blood". Screenwriter Jin Jian wrote the story step by step and section by section. When detective Ni Baochang scolded Qiao Liangcai, he must have thought that the plot had come to an end, but "the willows are dark and the flowers are bright, another village" until he went to find Xi Luju took a sharp turn, but the figure was nowhere to be seen, unfolding another tortuous story. This amazing stroke is the biggest harvest point of "Beauty's Iron Blood".</p>
<p>Zhou Manhua's Xi Luju is limited by the plot and has few opportunities to act, but in the scenes she performs, her acting skills have the weight to control the personality of the characters in the play. The angry resistance when forced to be unyielding has a deep portrayal. Finally, after the case is clear, she scolds Qiao Liangcai loudly. Her words and expressions express her eagerness. It is her most successful performance in the whole play.</p>
<p>Huang He's Xi Yifang is completely in the state of a knight, and the spirit of justice is active in his excellent acting skills. The opening fighting scene is extremely heroic! Yong Qi, who plays the director, perfectly portrays the personality of a public official. Xu Xinyuan, who plays Qiao Liangcai, fully exposes the typical warlord. Ou Hui, who plays Ni Baochang, and Xu Wu, who plays Feng Shouchang, have excellent acting skills.</p>
<h3>Movie News Snippets</h3>
<p>The dance sequences for "Wan Zi Qian Hong" (Ten Thousand Purples and a Thousand Reds) were completed in the middle of this month. The part specifically for the movie will likely meet the audience around the beginning of next month. Dongbao actors are busy attending farewell banquets from various parties. It is said that after collaborating on a drama about the disaster in North China, they will travel eastward across the ocean. Afterward, those in the country who wish to see her vibrant dances will only be able to glimpse her stunning and graceful movements in "Wan Zi Qian Hong"!</p>
<p>During the plum rain season, the weather is unpredictable, causing delays in the location shooting for "Fisher Girl" in Suzhou and Wuxi. Bu Wancang, under orders from the production department, has instructed the First Studio to complete all indoor scenes before resuming outdoor shooting.</p>
<p>Yue Feng's "Dang Ren Hun" (Soul of the Party Member) requires a grand scale, with elaborate costumes, sets, and props, necessitating considerable research time. Currently, during this downtime, "Tian Luo Di Wang" (Heaven and Earth Net) is being filmed, starring Gao Zhanfei, Mei Yun, and Yu. The film depicts the conflicts between law and human sentiment, set against the backdrop of the North China drought, aiming to awaken the nation's awareness of the severity of the disaster in North China.</p>
<p>Yin's new work, "Qian Liang Ai Hong" (A Thousand Distressed Geese), starring Yan Jun, Wang Yuanlong, and Bai Guang, is currently in the script stage. It is planned to be filmed in northern Jiangsu, using the levee project as its backdrop. The film depicts the catastrophic danger of a levee collapsing and destroying fishing villages. Engineers are currently being hired to design the scenes, and preparations for filming are actively underway.</p>
<p>Fang Peilin, a native of Qingbo, often makes a lot of noise when directing work on the film set. One day, during the sound recording of You Fu's song for "Wan Zi Qian Hong," Li Lihua suddenly said to everyone, "We're officially recording now, Ah Fang-ge, please don't make so much noise." At that moment, Fang Peilin was not making any noise, sitting obediently behind Li Lihua.</p>
<p>Han Langen took many photos of the Dongbao actors at the First Studio, one after another, tirelessly. Wang Yin criticized his photographic art as being like a monkey, acting as if it were a serious matter.</p>
<p>Yada Shigeru, the dance coach of the Dongbao Troupe, most admired Li Lihua's genius acting. On the evening of the 12th, while filming a stage scene at the Lyceum Theatre, he actually knelt down at Li Lihua's feet during her dance. At that moment, Li Lihua was startled, thinking he was proposing marriage in public.</p>
<h3>Gao Lihen Joins Huaying</h3>
<p>Gao Lihen, a famous director from Hong Kong who came to Shanghai, has officially joined Huaying and begun directing work. His first new film is "Xinsheng" (New Life), starring Huang He and Wang Danfeng. Filming has started at the No. 4 Studio in the Xujiahui Triangle Street area.</p>
<h3>"Huichun Qu" Director Completes Work</h3>
<p>Someone once criticized: Liu Qiong's current position is the same as Jin Yan's before the war. This statement is very pertinent.</p>
<p>Now he is a director. He directed the film "Huichun Qu" (Song of Returning Spring) under the circumstances of writing, directing, and acting himself. He worked diligently for more than two months. He carefully handled every scene, every shot, and every character.</p>
<p>Although the entire crew worked for five or six consecutive nights during the filming process, no one complained. Instead of feeling tired, their spirits were even more invigorated.</p>
<p>"Huichun Qu" has been completely filmed under these working conditions. What remains are just a few scattered reshoots.</p>
<h3>From Manchuria to Shanghai (3)</h3>
<p>— Hashimoto Kanrin</p>
<p>Retrieving National Treasures</p>
<p>This happened as early as twenty years ago. When I was traveling in Paris, the French government wanted to ask the British government to return Rodin's bronze statue of the Burghers of Calais, which had been sent to the City of London during his lifetime, to Paris. I don't know what happened to that matter, but it seemed to be unresolved until I returned home.</p>
<p>This is a problem between London and Paris, which are only separated by a strait. It shows how deeply a country cares about its own art. At that time, it was unimaginable for the Japanese, who were far removed from art countries. Recently, Germany returned the Emperor Jun'e's imperial portrait, which, although not solely an artistic issue, is still a pleasant thing.</p>
<p>One day, I discussed such matters with a Chinese person I knew well in a Chinese restaurant through writing. I believed that although it had not yet been seen in the United States, the treasures of Gaochang, Turpan, and other places in the United Kingdom, France, and other countries should be returned to Asia. I even wrote an article on this matter in a journal published among overseas Chinese in Japan. At that time, I heard that when the famous stone carvings of the Eight Horses of Zhaoling—the burial place of Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty—were to be taken to the United States, some Chinese people were surprised and expressed their opposition. Although they were returned immediately afterward, how long they were taken and how many were taken are all legends. The things from Turpan and Dunhuang, needless to say, were taken disrespectfully without permission.</p>
<p>According to a certain antique dealer who runs a shop in Beijing, the stone statues scattered in Longmen or Tianmen were probably taken by the Chinese army. The people who bought them were very grandiose, saying it was for the military's provisions, and the military, in gratitude, sent soldiers to escort them to a safe location. Most of these were troops from the Communist Party system or warlords like Feng Yuxiang. Therefore, many things were loaded onto ships and taken abroad.</p>
<p>Before I went to Europe, I dared not speculate about the export of Japanese ancient art to foreign countries because my knowledge was limited. I wrote about such things in my travelogue and said: "The art of a country must be savored and appreciated in the environment where that art was produced. Art is inseparable from its land. Seeing Japanese art overseas is as desolate as a prostitute." The Ferscht collection in Germany's Cologne Museum is mainly composed of Japanese Buddhist statues. At that time, I, who was deeply interested in Buddhist statues, made a special trip to Cologne to admire them. I had heard of the Ferscht collection in Japan, which was quite famous, but because it was collected by foreigners, what I saw could only be a part of it.</p>
<p>The Chinese people have not mentioned "returning Asian things to Asia" since then. Not long before the Incident, that kind of movement seemed to have risen once. I also received promotional books from China. The Japanese authorities also often stated that Japan had no territorial ambitions. I think we should cooperate with China to urge the government to use the power of the people to recover many ancient art objects taken to the United Kingdom and the United States. This is not only my personal wish.</p>
<p>A few days before I was about to return home from Shanghai, a certain lieutenant colonel invited me to tea. When I went downstairs from the Cathay Hotel, what I saw was the scene of the sinking of the British warship HMS Prince of Wales at 5:20 AM on December 8th. Listening to the lieutenant colonel's description and recalling the scene, I couldn't help but feel my blood boiling. One cannot know where all the subjects of painting exist beforehand. Even in the same place, depending on one's perspective, the scenery can change. For example, in one's own garden, because a tree has been removed, the appearance looks completely different. The next day, I obtained permission and wrote a rough sketch. The first thing I saw, to the right of the place closest to the balcony where the HMS Prince of Wales sank, was a building with a large clock on the roof. The surrounding area was still blurry at 5 AM each day. I immediately thought that the hands of the large clock should be clearly remembered, as it was exactly 5:20 AM.

<h3>First Special District Prosecutor's Office: Public Notice for Unclaimed Male and Female Corpses</h3>
<p>(Letter Received) To Whom It May Concern: Dying away from home, without family knowing, the dead buried in mass graves, the living relying on inquiries and looking forward in vain—this is the most tragic event in the world. The Shanghai Municipal Police Department reports many cases of deaths every day. If there is an ID card, the family can still be investigated. All those whose names are unknown are collectively referred to as "unnamed male" and "unnamed female." Those with belongings are stored in the hospital and posted for public notice for a period of six months, but there is ultimately no way to reach the ears of the deceased's family. It is now planned to send the more important cases of inspection and public notice to your newspaper for publication, so that the relatives and friends of the deceased can know the news as soon as possible, which is beneficial for both the living and the dead. Sincerely, the First Special District Prosecutor's Office.</p>
<p>(1) Tang Deng Qianwen, on August 20 of last year, followed her husband, Mr. Tang, a native of Hangzhou, to stay at the Continental Hotel. She committed suicide by poisoning the next night. Her husband has not returned. The police reported the death as an unnamed female. After investigation, her name was found. She left behind books, clothing, and a diploma from Guanghua University. The deceased appears to be someone from academic circles. She must have relatives and friends in Shanghai and Hangzhou.</p>
<p>(2) Unnamed male child, about 14 years old, resembling a student, was found dead on April 19 of this year outside Anyi Village on Alabast Road. He was wearing a long dark robe, grey trousers, brown socks, cotton shoes, and a woolen hat. He was sent for inspection on the 21st. The corpse was mutilated. He left behind a bundle of rubber bands and a child's hat, which are stored in the warehouse for public notice.</p>
<p>(3) Unnamed female, about 40 years old, fell ill and was lying on the sidewalk near Sichuan Road and Qiujiang Road on the afternoon of May 17 of this year. She was sent to the hospital and died. Her name and address are unknown. She left behind stored value certificates worth 124 yuan, 6.1 Japanese cents, a rice purchase certificate No. 396 from the Rice Store, and certificates for miscellaneous grains, flour, oil, and sugar, which are stored in the warehouse for public notice.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of the Disaster in Chao-Shan</h3>
<p>— Xiao Kangshi</p>
<p>Here is another report from my friend Mr. Lin Wenyi on the recent situation of the disaster in Chao-Shan, recorded below: (1) In Heping Township, Chao-Yang, there is a Biao River that flows into the sea, half a li wide. The river flows faster than the Huangyong River. Dozens of disaster victims from neighboring townships who are hungry and desperate come here to commit suicide by jumping into the river every day. (2) As the weather gets hotter, countless people die of heatstroke due to hunger. They are all buried with straw mats, and the charity halls are also helpless. (3) Some families cannot bear the hunger and commit suicide by poisoning. (4) More than 1,000 children abandoned by passing refugees in Yiying Township, Chaoyang, are left without relief. Dozens of them must starve to death every day. (5) Food prices are skyrocketing. The poorest people fill their stomachs with tree bark and grass roots. One jin of yam medicine costs about three yuan.</p>
