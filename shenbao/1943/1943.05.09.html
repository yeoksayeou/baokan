<p>社評</p>
<h3>如何完成大東亞戰爭</h3>
<p>大東亞戰爭的完成，就是大東亞現階段中的一個唯一的最高目標。然而，要完成這個唯一的最高目標，對外必須在大東亞圈內肅淸英美帝國主義的侵略勢力，對內必須建立大東亞圈內各民族和各國家的自由平等。這是不能缺少之絕對條件。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭，是大東亞十萬萬人民的共同戰爭，決不是僅限於某一國或某一民族的戰爭。如果僅限於某一國或某一民族的戰爭，那末，結果縱使達到肅淸英美帝國主義的侵略勢力，也不能建立大東亞圈內各民族和各國家的自由平等。所以，凡是大東亞圈內之每一個人民，都不能忽略此種認識，而且必須根據此種認識以負起完成大東亞戰爭的共同使命。</p>
<p>我們曾指出，大東亞戰爭業已從軍事作戰的階段，進入政治，經濟，外交，軍事等綜合性的作戰階段。因此，在目前階段中，要完成大東亞戰爭，最主要的，是實現全面和平和聯合大東亞圈內各民族和各國家共同協力。換句話說，實現全面和平和聯合大東亞圈內各民族和各國家，就是完成大東亞戰爭的前提條件。</p>
<p>那末，如何才能實現全面和平呢！首先政府要重視和平區內人民的要求，改善人民生活，使堅定和平信念，衷心擁護政府，然後政府地位强化，政治走上軌道，使重慶統治下的人民，相率自動趨歸。</p>
<p>至於强化國民政府地位，是最近友邦日本關於對華問題中最主要的問題，可是，强化國民政府，必不是把政府和人民分離，而促進政治力量，更不是造成人民與政府間政治上的矛盾，於人民頭上加上一種精神上的重壓。這是言强化國民政府的，不能忘却之基本條件。如果强化國民政府的結果，是把政府和人民分離，促進政治力量的結果，是造成人民與政府間政治上的矛盾，那末，非但國家不能復興，也不能負担完成大東亞戰爭的重任。</p>
<p>其次，大東亞圈內十萬萬人民，包含着十幾個民族和國家，要把這複雜的民族和國家聯合起來，必須去調整各民族和各國家的利害關係。要調整各民族和各國家的利害關係，必須站在互相尊重互相諒解的自由平等的精神上面。關於此點，我們相信友邦日本方面早已定爲基本國策。因爲最近對中國發還租界取消治外法權交還敵產等等，這些都可以證明日本的對華新政策的轉變。因此，我們期待大東亞圈內各民族，明白上面所說的……大東亞戰爭是我們東亞人的共同戰爭，一定要負起這個共同的責任，才有主張自由平等的權利。</p>
<p>我們既已認淸必先完成上面所述的兩個前提條件，才可以完成大東亞戰爭。那末，所謂實現全國和平與聯合各民族等等，雖然要靠我們東亞人各個的警覺自己的責任和互相尊重協力以外，還不能忽視世界局勢給我們的影響。因爲現在一切的問題、都和國際情勢不能分離而有息息相關的作用。因此，要如何配合着世界局勢去推進一切，再進一步，要如何去牽動世界局勢使牠成爲有利我們的條件，都是非常重要的問題。可是，這些問題主要的推動力，其重心母寗說是在日本方面者爲多，因爲日本在現階段中是東亞的最强國家，日本的舉止才有牽動世界局勢的可能。因此，我們非常重視重光外相的外交新措施。我們期望重光外相的外交能幫助德國消滅英美的勢力，建設歐洲新秩序。同時，更期望重光外相能在不久之將來促使太平洋新憲章的實現，能使蘇聯也共同擔負建設東亞新秩序的責任。</p>

<h3>寄新駐華大使</h3>
<p>日本的對華政策，以國府參戰而全面的飛躍展開之後，駐華大使的責務更加重要。一部分專管租界雖巳交還國府，但撤廢治外法權尙在準備　衝中，國策會社的調整，及其他經濟關係諸懸案，堆如山積，亟待處理。又對華政策的躍進，一般以爲全出意外，所以聽說僑華日人之中，迄今尙有不明其眞相而抱不安之念者。假使所傳屬實，則不能不從速闡明，俾燡羣　　。治外法權撤廢後，僑華日人之安全的確保，福利的增進，更須妥爲硏究而折衝。</p>
<p>參戰後國府的强化及其生產的增進，爲所課於國府自身的緊要任務，目前國府的實力，僅靠本身的力量尙不能完成此任務，依然需要日方之全面的支援。而介紹日方的支援，立於日本與國府之間，使密切地聯繫起來者，自然是駐華大使。重光前大使之任爲駐華大使，極爲適宜，在轉變對華政策的前後，其苦心與努力，實有很大的貢獻，茲因上次的內閣改組而轉任外相，由谷前外相爲駐華大使，繼其後任。</p>
<p>谷新大使爲外交官的識見手腕與力量，早有定評，母庸贅述。唯駐華大使的責務，如上所述，旣如此重大，我們謹乘此機會，希望新大使對此有充分認識，盡其最大努力，使對華新政策有圓滿開展。（翔：譯自四月二十九日東京每日新聞）</p>

<h3>湘北日軍　攻佔安鄉縣城　日軍續向東南挺進渝王纘緒部陷重圍</h3>
<p>南京八日中央社電　日軍於八日攻陷渝軍第七十七師之牙城安鄉後，即繼續追擊王纘緒所部敗軍，當日九時半即進抵洞庭湖西北岸要衝白埠口，（安鄉東南十六公里）又沿藕池運河西岸南下之日軍，已遮斷欲由安鄉地區逸退之渝軍退路，至已繼續繞向安鄉南方進攻。又沿九都運河西岸南下向南縣進攻之日軍八日十時半已突破南縣城西北八公里之浪泊河。渝軍百六十一師主要據點之南縣城，巳遙遙在望。陷落僅爲時間問題。又由華容方面向西南推進之渝所編第五師經過激烈之山岳戰後，已於八日進抵南山山脈要衝大乘寺，在該方面尤作頑强抵抗之渝軍，已漸趨崩潰。又沿長江南下之日軍舟艇機動部隊曾在圓山寺六步庵附近擊潰渝軍約二千，現仍繼追向湘洇廟（安鄉南廿公里）殘敗之渝軍。總之現在之戰况，已入於追擊機動戰階段，王纘緒四個師約四萬人之命脈，已如風前之燭。</p>
<p>湖南前綫某地八日中央社電日軍各精銳都隊爲殲滅湖南平原繼續蠢動之渝軍，（第二十九集團軍）軍長王纘緒部約四萬名，乃自五日午夜與航空部隊協力，自各方面一齊出動，進至高何塲）藕池口東南方二公里），上三島河（藕池口南方二公里），南山（華容南方十公里）一帶，八日上午四時三十五分突入渝軍最主要據點安鄉。同時日軍另一部隊與此相呼應，繼續進攻，迫至距南縣僅若干公里之地點，如斯漸次形成連結官澢，安鄉，南縣之一大包圍圈。渝軍（第二十九集團軍）所部第十五，第百六十二，暫編第五，第七十七四師四萬名，現徬徨於包圍圈內，其命運已迫在旦夕。又日航空部隊呼應地上部隊，連日活躍異常。五日拂曉發現渝軍第百六十二師於砂口（藕池口西方十二公里）之湖沼地帶頑强抵抗，當即施以猛烈轟炸，掩護地上部隊壓迫渝軍向南方潰走。六日未明，探知渝軍圖脫出包圍網，正於安鄉北方之藕池運河下流集結輸送船，當即以大編隊出動，對於該運河北岸航行中之渝軍舟艇約五十艘，投下直擊彈炸，毀十數艘，幷重創其他廿餘艘。繼於安鄉南方十公里之白埠口附近，發現滿載渝軍之五百噸大型輸送船，即對之加以猛炸，使之大破。如斯渝軍之脫圍企圖完全受挫。又日機大編隊曾於安鄉上空以機槍掃射移動中之渝軍地上部隊。</p>
<h3>晉南日軍　攻佔麻田鎭</h3>
<p>南京八日中央社電　日軍部隊自對共系「第十八集團軍」據點陟縣盆地猛攻以來，七日晚已在該縣共產軍陣地一帶展開肉搏戰，今日起更展開陸空之立體的猛攻。此外日軍於太岳山脈沁源及岳陽周圍進攻共軍陳賡所部「獨立第一師，」「太岳縱隊」約三千名，今日晨已於沁源一帶將共軍主力完全包圍，並與山西剿共軍連合，壓縮包圍網加以猛攻。</p>

<p>東京八日中央社電　據南部太行山前綫八日來電，渝政權因此次「第二十四集團軍」作戰失敗，全軍悉遭殲滅，而華北殘存之唯一抗戰據點亦已喪失，渝方一方面對此次敗戰之責任者「冀察戰區總司令」蔣鼎文嚴加追問，同時並爲掩飾抗戰陣營崩潰之眞相，乃竭力宣傳稱，渝軍有力部隊刻已渡過黃河，向普省方面挺進，從事擾亂日軍後方云云。但事實上渡黃河沿岸來攻之渝軍，均係小規模之部隊，隨時爲日軍華北警備隊擊滅。蓋上月二十九日渝「第一戰區」所部「第四十九軍」約八百名，曾侵至晋南垣曲縣楊木灣附近一舉，經日軍發覺後，當即將其團團包圍，激戰結果，斃四十名，俘虜三十名。又有盤據晋南黃河沿岸平陸西方十二公里附近之渝「第七戰區」「第一獨立縱隊」約三百名，欲渡黃河，日軍俟其渡過後，乃將渡河點封鎖，悉數將其包圍殲滅，渝軍遺屍一二二具，被俘第二支隊長上校以下二十二名，又於本月三四兩日，日軍部隊　剿滅盤據於中條山脈橫水嶺附近之渝系貢眞一匪團，乃澈底施以痛擊，斃渝軍一百三十名，俘虜五十名。</p>

<p>前年十二月八日大東亞戰爭發動之始，國民政府根據中日基本關係條約之精神，聲明決與友邦日本同甘共苦。自是以來，著手新國民運動，從事保障治安，改善民生，期於增進國力，協助大東亞戰爭之完遂。乃英美等國仍沿用其百年以來分裂東亞之政策，且變本加厲，竟勾引渝方分子，參加所謂英美戰綫，出兵緬印，以東亞人殘殺東亞人，最近因其暴力已次第爲友邦日本陸海空軍所擊破，侵略東亞之根據地亦已喪失，乃益逞狡謀。且嫉視國民政府統治區域之和平發展，嗾使渝方分子不斷侵擾，以阻撓各種建設之進行，並逕以自國飛機，藉渝方爲根據，向我武漢廣州等處，屢施轟炸，殘害平民，在渝方分子，甘受英美驅使，躬爲東亞叛逆，固屬可恥；而英美對於束亞處心積慮，盡其挑撥離間之能事，以圖途其最後併呑之欲，尤爲東亞民族所當同仇敵愾。國民政府爲此宣告，自今日起，對英美處於戰爭狀態，當悉其全力，與友邦日本協力，一掃英美之殘暴，以謀中國之復興，東亞之解放。滿泰兩國，夙敦友好，對於東亞共榮，尤具同心，今後當益謀提携，以期共同建設以道義爲基礎之束亞新秩序。德義諸友邦，數年以來，在西方與英美勢力周旋，迭獲勝利之光榮，我國今茲參加大東亞戰爭，當相與呼應，以期對於世界全體之公正的新秩序有所貢獻，凡我國民，當知此爲實現國父大亞洲主義之唯一時會，中華民國之復興，大東亞共榮建設之實現，世界全體正義和平之獲得，胥繫於此。其一德一心，戮力始終，以貫徹此偉大時代之偉大使命！</p>

<h3>日以一億圓　貸與蒙疆銀行</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　大東亞共榮圈內建設金融圈之計劃，自去年五月以來，已根據大東亞經濟建設之基本方針，節節付諸實現。日本銀行此次復以一億圓借與蒙疆銀行，作爲信用借款，並於本日下午十一時，假此間日本銀行總行，由日本銀行總裁結城氏，及蒙疆銀行總裁宗像氏間已正式簽字。蓋此次借款，乃自去年一月與蒙疆銀行間所訂立之票據借款交易額增加至九千萬元，同時並新成立五千萬元之信用借款。按日本銀行自昭和十六年（民國三十年）與國民政府間成立一二億圓之借款後，繼於去年三月與中央儲備銀行成立一億圓信用借款，本年三月復以二億圓借款與中國聯合準備銀行，今又成立此次信用借款，可謂大東亞金融之建設已節節獲得成功，同時在强化以日本爲中心之大東亞經濟連繫上，亦深具重大意義云。</p>

<h3>突境海岸地帶爭奪戰　進達最猛烈階段　比賽大撤退突尼斯在巷戰中</h3>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　德軍司令部當局七日夜就突尼西亞戰綫戰况官稱，反軸　軍雖巳突破軸心軍防地，但軸心軍現正向敵軍側面進行反攻，刻正激戰中，現戰事中心巳移至海岸地帶，軸心軍陣地之外衛綫與內衛綫之間因軸心軍進行巧妙機動之作戰，巳有進展。軸心軍現正力抗優勢敵軍，死守陣地，以抵禦反軸心軍所展開之扇形攻勢。在軸心軍防禦部隊進行機動作戰之下，予敵軍損害甚鉅。</p>
<p>羅馬八日中央社電　義軍司令部於八日發表公報稱，軸心軍在突尼斯及比塞大之抵抗，已吿失敗云。</p>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　德軍發言人，於八日正午，說明突尼西亞戰况稱，軸心軍巳於破壞軍事設施後，自比塞大撤退，但突尼斯仍有激烈之卷戰，且突尼西亞大部地方仍由軸心軍掌握，反軸心軍而於七日又以優勢之機械化部隊，繼續進攻，軸心軍當即迎擊，使反軸心軍之包圍企圖遭受挫折，反軸心在人力物力上均蒙莫大損害，軸心軍亦有相當損失云。</p>
<p>柏林八日中央社電德軍司令部七日正午官稱，突尼西亞戰綫之軸心軍，以十對一之劣勢，巳撤至新陣地，又法國通信社引用路透電稱，反軸心軍司令部七日夜發表，反軸心軍已將突尼斯及比塞大兩港完全佔領。</p>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　據德國新聞社由軍界方面獲悉，敵軍在突尼西亞前綫北部與中部重加整頓與部署後，於星期四發動新大規模之攻擊，換言之，即突尼西亞前綫各焦點最劇之爭鬥，前因軸心軍之頑强抵抗而屢吿展期者，現巳終於開始矣。控制戰區各重嬰公路之軸心砲臺，以猛烈之砲火迎擊敵軍之進攻，敵軍於遭受重大之損失後，方始稍有進展，此役中軸心軍展開蝟形陣地，向人數較多之敵軍，奮勇抵禦。中部陣地內外圈之間靠近沿海一帶，激戰正在進行，敵軍不顧奇重之損失，弁坦克車與飛機掩護之下，連續進攻，但軸心軍發動反攻，目下仍在進展中，敵軍利用空軍部隊抵禦軸心軍之行動，但軸心軍憑藉巧妙之戰術，已於星期四將整個戰區裂分爲數段。</p>
<p>德在地中海沿岸構築南方齊格菲</p>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　德總統大本營鑒於突尼西亞戰事之推移，爲樹立周密之作戰，特以西西里島及撒丁島爲　衛，在　中海岸構築南方齊格菲防綫，完成鐵桶般之防禦，故當茲突尼西亞戰事大轉變之際，此問各報仍稱，「德軍毫未　露動搖之色，突尼西亞戰綫之使命，業已終了」，其中柏林交易報曾刊稱，「反軸心於去歲十一月侵入北非時，彼等曾謂於數日間，即能將該地區收爲己有，然由於軸心軍之勇敢奮戰，遂將彼等之企圖完全粉粹，並迪使反軸心軍撤至阿爾及利亞國境，倘反軸心軍若欲再度攻擊，則必須增援大軍以供犧牲，據現在情勢視之，固可謂反軸心已達所期之目的，然不能忘記者，其已耗時六閱月，反軸心軍在突尼西亞戰綫所遭之損傷，恐將水遠爲被等作戰之陣碍」。又德國民衆報亦曾刋稱，突尼西亞軸心利用過去六個月之奮戰，遂使反軸心軍未能應蘇聯之冬季攻勢，於歐洲大陸展開第二戰綫，軸心軍利用該期間構築大西洋岸鐵壁之防禦陣，此因機密關係，現暫不能發表，總之軸心軍已完成萬全措置，故自戰局大勢視之，突尼西亞地方之得失，完全不能成其問題云。</p>
<h3>瑞典外長重申　維持中立政策</h3>
<p>期德哥爾姆八日中央社電瑞典外長根塞，昨晚在艾西克爾斯托那工業區，發表演說，瑞典在肚次戰爭中之中立，　不能謂爲具有十分把握，但吾人確信中立爲有用之外交政策，根氏之演辭甚長，大部份係述及瑞典中立之法律基礎，及該國在日前戰事中外交政策之歷史，據稱此次戰爭及瑞典外交政策，可分爲四個階段，（一）自歐戰發生至挪威戰役時止，其時瑞典曾竭力維持其對外貿易。（二）自一九四〇年四月九日戰爭逼近瑞典炎門戶時起，瑞典當時不得不採取新態度，乃根據海牙公約，禁止各國假道。（三）挪威完全被佔後，瑞典即受德蘇之包圍，瑞典政府深信此種現狀，將　續相當時期，是　對外貿易之關係，不得不大事轉變。瑞典陷於各交載國封鎖綫內，自須與德英變方締結協定，充許休　德　及戰具之假道，同時先以封鎖綫外之瑞典商船六十萬　，和於英國，以後瑞典護航隊之得出入於哥特堡，實賴此項中立政策。（四）起於德蘇戰爭之爆發，其時瑞典允德軍一師團經過瑞典開往芬蘭。此雖違反中立原則，但祗以一次爲限，自開戰以來，時有外國飛機及軍艦，侵入瑞典領空與領海，尤以未　蘇潛艇爲　甚，倘使瑞典不採取此項中立政策，則今日之　　必大不相同，須知每一中立國家必須有其自己之政策，中立　對雙方交戰國之關係，如欲其完全均衡，自不可能，瑞典迫於環境，爲欲獲得必需之物　計，故不得不給予他國以代價，而給予德國者，自較給予歐西各國爲鉅大，此　出無可奈何也，深望全國民衆，不爲謠言所惑，繼續信賴政府之中立政策云。</p>

<h3>建設經濟上海　完成中日共興</h3>
<p>— 武內文彬</p>
<p>武內文彬先生，爲友邦日本的名經濟學者，現任上海日本工商會譏所常務理事，熟悉中國經濟情形。是文原題爲中日的「御一新」，按「御一新」之意思，即維新之義。結論爲建設經濟上海，進而完成中日經濟共興。立意公允，論列精闢。　本年一月九日起，日本對華政策轉變後，這裏的情勢，顯示　複雜微妙的動向。其具體的影響，在思想分野上也有，經濟社會分野上也有，約而言之，其影響有明暗兩種。一種人感覺愉快，樂觀；一種人則表示焦燥，沉痛，不安的難色。此種影響，又可分爲中日兩種形色，概括的說，當前的事態，日本方面是焦燥，沉痛，不安；中國方面是愉快，樂觀。</p>
<p>這可以認爲是今次轉變政策的眞正成功麽？</p>
<p>這次澈底轉變政策，經濟政策的眞正目的，就是在獲得中日的木來面目，在求我人的目光中小要再存彼　之別，做到中日如一家的地步。目的旣然如此，那麼中日之間斷不容分什麽明暗，我認爲目前的一些明暗之分，不過是爲求糾正不平開闢中日如一家之境　過渡風浪。</p>
<p>看到中日本然的關係，就不得不如此，但是不切合現實，甲論　駁，弄得莫衷一是，這是要不得的。而現地日僑倒還有此種現象，政府施策的眞意，至今還未完全了解，現地的施策，也不見得十分普及於大衆，這類現象，似乎和決戰時期不甚合適。</p>
<p>我有二點，願獻言彷徨的：人們第一，從幻夢中去求眞。第二，無夢的人生，爲求開拓混亂如麻的中日關係，也須一個富有浩氣的夢。這個夢越大越好，要曉得波濤萬丈，爲了確立千載不渝的中日關係，希望大家要有勇敢的精神，犧牲的決心，耐苦的修養。最黑暗的時候，就是接近最明朗的時候，設爲一時盪動現象而迷惑，豈能得到最善最大的成就</p>
<p>我在此複雜微妙的環境中，想起了一件往事：逆水行舟，革古鼎新的明洽維新的印象</p>
<p>明治維新與大化的革新，建武中興同爲日本歷史上劃紀元的大革新，明治維新，第一件得到民心的，就是王政復古，尊王攘夷的兩句標語。</p>
<p>首先倡言廢刀論，在敎會聖堂結婚的森有禮，他還有過一種怪論調，主張把英語作爲新興日本的國語，而號召天下，或曰廢除日本服裝，全國應穿西服，燒毀東京全巿，改爲　洋建築，這種怪論，自與衆意違背。現在日不奈良猿澤池畔，有座華路的寳塔，當初僅由民間捐資十圓興建，可是要拆毀它倒還要一筆巨款，因爲得不償失，所以得免去拆毀的厄運。</p>
<p>這種異想天開的指導原理，就是風靡一時的「御一新」</p>
<p>此次日對華政策大轉變，實在就是中日「御一新」與東亞「御一新」的別語。如其果然如此，則在那崇高的精神上，在革古鼎新上，不能不覺悟到明治時代「御一新」的波瀾重疊，悲喜交集，將復見於今日。</p>
<p>中日新協定撤廢了把中國殖民地化的治外法權與交還租界，使中國掙脫了百年的桎梏，完成了一個完全主權的國家。如其這不能說是「御一新」尙有何物可說是中國國際史上的，且爲中日關係史上的「御一新」呢？</p>
<p>波瀾與犧牲自然是早巳料到的。箭巳經離弦了，躊躇，卑屈與退縮足以敗事。一切的鄙陋與傍觀的態度應加以拂除。向國策所指示的大道前進的精神，才是死裏求生的方法。如此，中日外交轉變之煊爛的鐵塔，始能够創立起來。</p>
<p>其次，我們的筆鋒，將涉及經濟分野。此次的轉　中，最難而又爲衆矢之的者，是這經濟的分野，而中日在明暗間淸楚地顯出對立的狀態，亦是這經濟的領域。這經濟的合作能否成功，實爲決定此次外交轉變的功罪的法庭。我們現在舉幾個例來看：</p>
<p>第一，三月十六日起創立了全國商業統　總會，作爲實施收買配給的一元的指導統制機關。第二，揚子江下游地帶蘇浙皖三省物資移動之劃時期的緩和。第三，與這二者，尤其與全國商業統制會有表裏一體之關聯的華中貿易統制機關，最近即將創立。第四，握全中國經濟復興建設之鍵的建設「經濟上海」的問題。第五，用全上海所積存的大量存貨推動全中國經濟，如其這利用存貨的辦法能够決定，則轉變後新經濟政策的規模，始具備了圓滿的綜合體制。</p>
<p>上　（三）（四）（五）三者，其本體尙未實現，（一）（二）兩者的令貌，巳略見端倪。卽全國商業統制總會與物資移動限制的暖和，事變以來，連做夢也不曾想到的，已經有如下述那樣偉大的性質上的變化。</p>

<p>法當局昨發表公告</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>農村貸款</h3>
<p>在「戰時經濟政策網領」限定行莊放款，以扶助生產事業爲對象的一個重要原則之下，我們對於農村貸款，早就再四提偶，無非因爲農產出品的减少，實足以造成整個國家社會的經濟恐慌。所以，在生產事業各部門的貸放中，農貸實當佔居首要地位。</p>
<p>財政部當局，爲謀復興農村，增强生產起見，曾責成交通銀行辦理復興農村放款事宜：該行因去年所組織的農村調査團，派赴蘇浙皖直省各地農村實地調査，業巳吿一段落，刻正硏究農業貸款的方式。</p>
<p>關於此點，我們願意以第三者的立塲，發表一點意見。以我們所知道的，當局爲着協助農村生產事業的復興，對於農村貸付資金的利率，聞將竭力予以抑低，這當然是切要的。可是，我們認爲自貸款的方式而言，其原則不僅在於抑低貸款利率，而尤在於貸款的普遍化與其直接性。爲什麼須要普遍化？因爲我國的農民，什九都是貧農；他們的生活，最爲艱難，需款最爲迫切，而這般大多數的貧農，乃正是推進農業生產的原動力；所以我們所要接濟的，扶助的，使其安居而樂業，便是這般大多數的貧農。其次，爲什麽須有直接性？因爲各地農村中，無處不有歹徒惡棍，混跡其中，居間作祟；貸款最易流入這一般人的手中，以遂其高利轉貸和田地投機的行爲。那末，眞正的農民，那裏能够得到農村貸款的利益？所以，貸款方式的設計，注意普及貸放而外，還須以直接貸付爲前提。</p>
<p>總之一句話，復興農村生產，自然以農貸爲惟一無二法門，而辦理農貸成績，還要看貸款的方式，手續，步驟，與實施，是否處處合於理想。</p>
<h3>實業糧食兩部　分別指定統制商品　責由商統會辦理</h3>
<p>全國商業統制總會辦理物資之主要商品品目，巳由實業部糧食部分別以命令定之，茲將實業部糧食部之主管統制商品列後：</p>
<p>實業部</p>
<p>主管統制商品指定者：（一）棉花，（二）棉紗，（三棉製品（包括布疋及針織品）（四）化學工業品（包括原料西藥顏料染料及酒精）（五）毛織物及毛製品，（六）繭，（七）絲及絲製品，（八）工業油脂，（九）臘燭，（十）肥皂，（十一）火柴，（十二）塊煤及煤球，（十三）捲烟及烟葉，（十四）橡膠（包括原料及製品）（十五）五金（包括鐵鋼白鐵及非鐵金屬之原料及製品），（十六）玻璃（包括原料及製品），（十七）電氣器具（包括原料及製品），（十八）皮革。（包括原料及製品）</p>
<p>糧食部</p>

<h3>糧食業　滬會組織完成</h3>
<p>全國商業統制工作，在實業糧食兩部監督指導之下，早巳開始進行組織統制工作，最高機關全國商業統制總會已將各項糧食物資之統制計劃周全，共分千　部門，商統會內部有一部鬥，外間即有一聯合會聯合會之下再有各地同業公會各聯合會及上海市區之同業公會，由實業部糧食兩部駐滬辦事處分別督促進行，　中層機機聯合會與下層機構之各地區同業公會一朝組織完成，與上層之全國商業統制總會合爲一體，則整個物資統制之巨輪即可開始轉動，屆時不惟各業正當商人獲得保障，而一般之物價自必趨於平穩，故此項統制機構之早日完成，實爲政府與民衆當前所共同期待者，其影響於戰爭之前途，尤爲重鉅。糧食部顧部長因本部應進行督促組織之中下二層機構開始絞遲，深恐有誤整個統制工作之進行，爰嚴飭駐　負責人員加緊工作，限期完成，經陳市長之指示及商統會以及各方面之熱誠協助，所有糧部主管之食糧物資除米穀另有　法外，計麵粉雜糧　產蛋類，食用油糖等六部門之中下二層組織，於日內即可全部完成。</p>
<h3>財部准各行莊　暫繳解活存準備金　定存準備金不能以代用品繳解</h3>
<p>財政部金融檢査車務處前照「管理金融機關暫行條例」之規定，着本埠各銀行錢莊將活期定期存款之準備金，繳解至中央儲備銀行，各行莊對定期存款應繳之準備金額，業巳如數繳解，惟活期存款之準備金，則因種種關係，尙未依法繳解。銀錢兩業公會對於此事，曾呈請金融檢査事處，提出四點請予照准，計（一）活期存款之準備金暫緩繳納。（二）業已繳付之準備金，利息請予提高。（二）凡屬往來透支項下之活期存款，請勿列入活期存款之內。（四）定期存款之準備金，請亦以四成現款，六成代用品繳解，金融檢查事務處據呈後，即轉呈財政部請示，茲悉財政部當局對於本巿銀錢業所提出之四項請求，巳逐一加以批覆如下：</p>
<p>（一）各行莊應繳之活期存款準備金，准予暫緩兩月繳解。（即自六月一日起繳解）。</p>
<p>（二）業巳繳解之準備金，不便冉予提高利息。</p>
<p>（三）凡屬於往來透支科目項下之活期存款，准以每月之末日存數爲準，繳解準備金。</p>
<p>（四）活期存款之準備金准以一部份代用品繳解，原爲通融辦法，故定期存款之準備金，未便據例。</p>
<h3>市經濟局賡續指定　六業公會發起人</h3>
<p>上海特別巿經濟局爲通令調整本巿工商業同業公會，業經於上月指定棉花業等十業同業公會先後組織完成，日前又指定藥廠業，酒精廠業，火柴廠業等工業同業公會發起人，限期召集組織成立外，昨又賡續指定本市化學工業品業六業同業公會發起人限期組織完成，茲將各該業發起人名單錄誌如下：</p>

<h3>評價委員會　執行標準限價　違者査出公斷議處</h3>
<p>本巿各業同業公會，爲協助當局抑平百物售價，前曾分別組設各該業公會「評價委員會」，除負責評訂物品標準限價外，一面並進行調査配給等　宜。茲悉現各該公會評價委員會，鑒於各會員商店將物品售價暗中抬高，冀獲非分利潤，有失評價初衷，爰經決定，除次第開會審査過往所訂限價是否適合標準，並暗中派員，分赴各會員商號門市部密切調査，倘有發現其標價有抬高者，或不將貨品照限出售等者，即由該調査員將其店號地址，物品名等分別抄送到會，然後待評價委員會議商處罰辦法。又悉嗣後將由各業公會或其直屬一組負責辦理配給及採辦事宜，故公會責任巳較過失爲繁。</p>
<h3>各業聯合會動態</h3>
<p>麵粉業　全國麵粉業同業公會聯合會，經糧部指定孫仲立等爲籌備主任，積極着手籌備，茲巳就緖，定於明（十）日下午三時在江西路四三號二樓召開成立大食，各區均須推派代表出席，以資完成機構，又該會包括上海江蘇蘇北南京杭州嘉湖皖北皖南浙東等九區，均巳如期派員來滬向該會報到。</p>

<h3>華股趨勢</h3>
<p>華股寗靜，良因週六關係，人心呆平，僅新藥業中之新亞藥廠股求多供少，有顯著之進展，中法藥房價巳回小。文化業世界書局又有於本月十五日還廠消息，成交不弱，商務及中華書局均平。百貨業新新公司稍見做低，國貨公司略升，永安公司成交價與上日彷彿，永安紗廠及美亞綢廠均交稀價呆，公用業閘北水電略升，華商電氣乏人問津，南洋烟草及大中華火柴微升，久安實業及新益地產呆定。</p>
<h3>購買絨線須　向公會申請　申請人限成年女性核准後向商店領貨</h3>
<p>本巿毛綸業公會，鑒於市上絨綫存底稀薄，爲防止奸商囤積漁利，並爲節省戰時物資起見，特訂限制購買辦法，業已付諸實施，凡絨綫店一律停止門市交易，如市民欲購買絨綫，確係自用而必不可缺者，可向該會領取購買絨綫申請書，申請人限於成年女性，須出示市民證，未成年女性及男性一概不准，申請書塡就後，交該會審査，如係合格，該會在申請書上批明核准數量及發售商店之名稱，一面並通知該店，申請人可憑已核准之申請書，向指定之商店，繳款領貨。</p>

<h3>How to Accomplish the Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>The accomplishment of the Greater East Asia War is the sole and highest objective in the current stage of Greater East Asia. However, to achieve this sole and highest objective, it is absolutely necessary to eliminate the aggressive forces of British and American imperialism within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere externally, and to establish freedom and equality for all nations and countries within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere internally. These are indispensable conditions.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War is a common war for the one billion people of Greater East Asia, and it is by no means limited to a war of a single country or a single ethnicity. If it were limited to a war of a single country or a single ethnicity, then even if the aggressive forces of British and American imperialism were eliminated as a result, freedom and equality for all nations and countries within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere could not be established. Therefore, every single person within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere cannot ignore this understanding, and must, based on this understanding, assume the common mission of completing the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>We have pointed out that the Greater East Asia War has already transitioned from a stage of military operations to a comprehensive stage of operations encompassing politics, economics, diplomacy, and military affairs. Therefore, in the current stage, to complete the Greater East Asia War, the most important thing is to achieve comprehensive peace and unite all nations and countries within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere for joint cooperation. In other words, achieving comprehensive peace and uniting all nations and countries within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere are the preconditions for completing the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>So, how can we achieve comprehensive peace? First, the government must value the demands of the people within the peace zone, improve people's lives, strengthen their belief in peace, and sincerely support the government. Then, the government's position will be strengthened, politics will be on track, and the people under Chongqing's rule will be drawn to return automatically.</p>
<p>As for strengthening the position of the National Government, it is the most important issue in the recent policy of our friendly nation Japan regarding China. However, strengthening the National Government must not separate the government from the people, and promoting political strength must not create political contradictions between the people and the government, adding a spiritual burden to the people. These are basic conditions that cannot be forgotten when speaking of strengthening the National Government. If the result of strengthening the National Government is to separate the government from the people, and the result of promoting political strength is to create political contradictions between the people and the government, then not only will the nation not be able to revive, but it will also not be able to shoulder the heavy responsibility of completing the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Secondly, the one billion people within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere encompass more than a dozen ethnic groups and countries. To unite these complex ethnic groups and countries, we must adjust the interests of each ethnic group and country. To adjust the interests of each ethnic group and country, we must stand on the spirit of mutual respect, mutual understanding, freedom, and equality. Regarding this point, we believe that our friendly nation Japan has already established it as a basic national policy. Because the recent return of concessions to China, the abolition of extraterritorial rights, the return of enemy property, etc., all prove the change in Japan's new policy toward China. Therefore, we expect all ethnic groups within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to understand what was said above... The Greater East Asia War is a common war for us East Asians. We must take on this common responsibility in order to have the right to claim freedom and equality.</p>
<p>We have already recognized that the two preconditions mentioned above must be completed before the Greater East Asia War can be completed. Then, the so-called achievement of national peace and the union of all nations, etc., although it depends on each of us East Asians being aware of our own responsibilities and mutual respect and cooperation, we cannot ignore the impact of the world situation on us. Because all current issues are inseparable from the international situation and have a closely related effect. Therefore, how to coordinate with the world situation to promote everything, and further, how to influence the world situation to make it a condition favorable to us, are very important issues. However, the main driving force for these issues, its center, must be said to be mostly on the Japanese side, because Japan is the strongest country in East Asia in the current stage, and Japan's actions have the possibility of influencing the world situation. Therefore, we attach great importance to Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's new diplomatic measures. We hope that Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's diplomacy can help Germany eliminate the power of Britain and the United States and build a new European order. At the same time, we also hope that Foreign Minister Shigemitsu can promote the realization of a new Pacific Charter in the near future, and enable the Soviet Union to jointly assume the responsibility of building a new order in East Asia.</p>

<h3>To the New Ambassador to China</h3>
<p>After the all-out and dramatic unfolding of Japan's policy towards China with the National Government's participation in the war, the duties of the ambassador to China have become even more important. Although some of the concessions under exclusive control have already been returned to the National Government, the abolishment of extraterritorial rights is still in preparation. The adjustment of national policy companies and other pending economic relations issues are piled up like mountains, awaiting urgent handling. Furthermore, the advancement of the policy towards China is generally considered to be completely unexpected, so it is said that among the Japanese people residing in China, there are still those who do not understand the truth and hold feelings of unease. If what is being said is true, then it must be clarified as soon as possible to appease the masses. After the abolition of extraterritorial rights, ensuring the safety and enhancing the welfare of the Japanese people residing in China must be carefully studied and negotiated.</p>
<p>Strengthening the National Government and increasing its production after joining the war are crucial tasks assigned to the National Government itself. Currently, the National Government's strength is not sufficient to complete this task relying solely on its own power; it still needs comprehensive support from the Japanese side. And the person who introduces the Japanese side's support, stands between Japan and the National Government, and closely connects them is naturally the ambassador to China. Former Ambassador Shigemitsu's appointment as ambassador to China was extremely appropriate. Before and after the transition of the policy towards China, his painstaking efforts made great contributions. Due to the recent cabinet reshuffle, he was transferred to the position of Foreign Minister, and former Foreign Minister Tani was appointed as ambassador to China to succeed him.</p>
<p>The knowledge, skills, and power of the new Ambassador Tani as a diplomat have long been established and need no further elaboration. However, the duties of the ambassador to China are so significant, as mentioned above. We take this opportunity to express our hope that the new ambassador will fully recognize this and exert his best efforts to ensure the smooth development of the new policy towards China.

<h3>Prime Minister Tojo Returns to Fukuoka after Completing His Mission to the Philippines, Expressing Pleasure at the Military and Political State of the Region and Deeply Believing That the Completion of Reconstruction Is Not Far Away</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister and concurrently Minister of the Army, Tojo, completed his mission of visiting the Philippines this time and arrived safely in Fukuoka at 2:50 PM today. He also issued a statement, the gist of which is as follows: "During this inspection of various regions in the South, I had the opportunity to visit the Philippines first, to inspect the military and the military and political state of the region. The officers and civilians who are active in this area, and the key figures of the Philippine Executive Government held sincere talks. I witnessed the close cooperation between Japan and the Philippines in moving towards the completion of the Greater East Asia War and striving to build a new Philippines. I am very pleased to see the real situation. The activity of the Japanese soldiers in the Philippines is beyond what we imagined in the country. They not only overcome various difficulties in the heat and concentrate on carrying out the war, but also ensure security and diligently continue training. Furthermore, the military administration of the Philippines is also overcoming various obstacles and progressing smoothly. Whether Japanese or Filipinos, military officers or civilians, they can fully understand the meaning of this operation and the mission of the Philippines. Everyone is making the best efforts in their duties. After seeing this situation, I have more than doubled my determination, especially since the Filipino people understand the true intentions of Japan and actively cooperate with the military administration, and Director Vargas and others are devoting all their efforts to rebuilding the Philippines and striving to complete the construction of Greater East Asia at all times. This is not only a celebration for the regeneration of the Philippines, but also a celebration for the entire Greater East Asia. Because the United States' policies towards the Philippines have always been for its own sake, it superficially used the beautiful forms of material civilization to dazzle the eyes of the Filipino people, while actually deliberately failing to promote the robust and enterprising national spirit necessary for creating a nation, and even more failing to cultivate the economic power necessary for independence. Everywhere, it implemented policies that would benefit the United States itself, turning it into a colony. The Filipino people, unknowingly, have been intoxicated by its poisonous wine for many years. Fortunately, the progress of the Greater East Asia War has now completely awakened the Filipino people. Furthermore, if this kind of understanding and effort by the Filipino people is further strengthened, then I firmly believe that the day of completing the construction of a new Philippines is not far away. The views I have gained in the Philippines this time, combined with the recollection of the gradual development of Manchuria and Mongolia and the progress of the new Burma construction, are all observed together. I deeply express my gratitude to the boundless grace of our Emperor and believe that the construction of Greater East Asia will definitely progress step by step. Furthermore, when thinking of our distant future, our belief in victory becomes even stronger."</p>

<h3>Japanese Army in Northern Hunan Occupies Anxiang County Seat; Japanese Army Continues Southeast Advance; Wang Zanxu's Troops Surrounded</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese army captured Anxiang, the stronghold of the 77th Division of the Chongqing Army, on the 8th, it continued to pursue the defeated troops of Wang Zanxu's command. At 9:30 AM on the same day, they advanced to Baibukou, an important point on the northwest bank of Dongting Lake (16 kilometers southeast of Anxiang). The Japanese army, moving south along the west bank of the Ouchi Canal, has cut off the retreat route for the Chongqing army attempting to escape from the Anxiang area, and has continued to move around to the south of Anxiang. The Japanese army, advancing south along the west bank of the Jiudu Canal towards Nanxian, broke through Langbo River, 8 kilometers northwest of Nanxian City, at 10:30 AM on the 8th. Nanxian City, the main stronghold of the 161st Division of the Chongqing Army, is now looming in sight. Its fall is only a matter of time. Furthermore, the 5th Division, compiled by Chongqing and advancing southwest from the Huarong area, after a fierce mountain battle, advanced to Dacheng Temple, an important point in the Nanshan Mountains, on the 8th. The Chongqing army, which made a stubborn resistance in that area, has gradually collapsed. In addition, the motorized unit of the Japanese army's boats advancing south along the Yangtze River defeated about 2,000 of the Chongqing army near Yuanshan Temple and Liubuan, and is still continuing to pursue the remnants of the defeated Chongqing army towards Xiangyin Temple (20 kilometers south of Anxiang). In short, the current war situation has entered the stage of pursuit and maneuver warfare. The lifeline of Wang Zanxu's four divisions, about 40,000 men, is like a candle in the wind.</p>
<p>A Certain Place on the Hunan Front Line, 8th (Central News Agency) - The elite troops of the Japanese army, in order to annihilate the Chongqing army (29th Army Group), led by Wang Zanxu, with approximately 40,000 men, which continues to move in the Hunan Plain, cooperated with the air force and launched a simultaneous offensive from all directions, advancing to Gao Hecheng (2 kilometers southeast of Ouchikou), Kami Sando River (2 kilometers south of Ouchikou), Nanshan (10 kilometers south of Huarong), and other areas, breaking into Anxiang, the most important stronghold of the Chongqing army, at 4:35 AM on the 8th. At the same time, another unit of the Japanese army responded to this and continued to advance, forcing its way to a location only a few kilometers away from Nanxian, gradually forming a large encirclement circle linking Guanlang, Anxiang, and Nanxian. The four divisions, 15th, 162nd, Provisional 5th, and 77th, with approximately 40,000 men, of the Chongqing army (29th Army Group) are now wandering within the encirclement circle, and their fate is imminent. Furthermore, the Japanese air force, responding to the ground troops, has been unusually active for days. On the dawn of the 5th, it discovered the 162nd Division of the Chongqing army putting up a stubborn resistance in the marshland area of Shaqiao (12 kilometers west of Ouchikou), and immediately carried out a fierce bombing, covering the ground troops and forcing the Chongqing army to collapse southward. Early on the 6th, it was detected that the Chongqing army was trying to escape the encirclement and was gathering transport ships in the lower reaches of the Ouchi Canal north of Anxiang. Large formations were immediately dispatched, dropping direct hit bombs on about 50 Chongqing army boats sailing on the north bank of the canal, destroying more than a dozen ships and severely damaging more than 20 others. Then, near Baibukou, 10 kilometers south of Anxiang, a large 500-ton transport ship full of Chongqing troops was discovered, and it was heavily bombed, causing it to be severely damaged. In this way, the Chongqing army's attempts to break out of the encirclement were completely frustrated. Furthermore, large formations of Japanese aircraft strafed the Chongqing army ground troops moving in the sky above Anxiang.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Southern Shanxi Occupies Matian Town</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) - Since the Japanese army units launched a fierce attack on the Shixian Basin, the stronghold of the Communist "18th Army Group," on the 7th, a fierce hand-to-hand combat was launched in the area of the Communist army's positions in the county. From today onwards, a three-dimensional fierce attack by land and air was launched. In addition, the Japanese army attacked approximately 3,000 troops of Chen Geng's "Independent First Division" and "Taiyue Column" of the Communist army surrounding Qinyuan and Yueyang in the Taiyue Mountains. This morning, the main force of the Communist army was completely surrounded in the Qinyuan area, and in conjunction with the Shanxi anti-Communist army, the encirclement was compressed and a fierce attack was launched.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) - A certain advancing detachment of the Japanese army completely occupied Matian Town, the location of the headquarters of the Communist "18th Army Group" (an important point on the border of Shanxi and Henan Province), at 10:00 AM today. This area is the central area of the Communist army, where the main military, political, and party organs are clustered, and it is the source of the Communist bandits in North China. Centered on this area, there are multiple arsenals, ammunition factories, textile factories, and other factories in the surrounding area.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from the front line of the southern Taihang Mountains on the 8th, the Chongqing regime, due to the failure of the "24th Army Group" operation, the entire army was annihilated, and the only anti-Japanese stronghold remaining in North China was also lost. On the one hand, the Chongqing side severely questioned Jiang Dingwen, the "Commander-in-Chief of the Ji-Cha War Zone," who was responsible for the defeat. At the same time, in order to cover up the truth of the collapse of the anti-Japanese camp, it tried its best to publicize that powerful units of the Chongqing army had crossed the Yellow River and advanced towards the Pu Province area, engaging in disrupting the rear of the Japanese army. However, in fact, the Chongqing army attacking along the Yellow River bank was all small-scale units, which were annihilated by the Japanese army's North China garrison at any time. On the 29th of last month, the "49th Army" of the "First War Zone" of Chongqing, with approximately 800 men, invaded near Yangmu Bay, Yuanqu County, southern Shanxi. After being discovered by the Japanese army, it was immediately surrounded. As a result of the fierce battle, 40 men were killed and 30 men were captured. Furthermore, approximately 300 men of the "First Independent Column" of the "Seventh War Zone" of Chongqing, stationed near 12 kilometers west of Pinglu, on the banks of the Yellow River in southern Shanxi, attempted to cross the Yellow River. After the Japanese army waited for them to cross the river, it sealed off the crossing point and completely annihilated them. The Chongqing army left 122 corpses and 22 prisoners, including the commander of the Second Detachment, a colonel. Furthermore, on the 3rd and 4th of this month, the Japanese army thoroughly attacked and wiped out a bandit gang of Gong Zhenyi of the Chongqing faction stationed near Hengshui Ridge in the Zhongtiao Mountains, killing 130 Chongqing troops and capturing 50 prisoners.</p>
<p>Hankou, 8th (Central News Agency) - During the battle in Nanboyu, Zhanghezhuang, and Houhezhuang, south of Shennanzhen, western Hebei, on the 6th, the Japanese army units destroyed many Chongqing army warehouses and armories, and captured a large number of items. The results of the battle were as follows: 37 Chongqing army corpses were abandoned, 4 prisoners were captured, 35 rifles, 2 automatic rifles, and many other items were captured.</p>
<h3>Proclamation of War Against Britain and America by the National Government</h3>
<p>On December 8th of the previous year, at the start of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government, based on the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty, declared its determination to share weal and woe with friendly nation Japan. Since then, it has embarked on the New National Movement, engaged in safeguarding public order, and improving people's livelihoods, aiming to enhance national strength and assist in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, countries like Britain and America continue to employ their centuries-old policy of dividing East Asia, and have intensified their efforts, even luring elements from Chongqing to participate in the so-called British and American front, sending troops to Burma and India, to have East Asians slaughter each other. Recently, as their violent forces have been gradually defeated by the friendly nation Japan's army, navy, and air force, and their bases for aggression in East Asia have been lost, they have become even more cunning. Moreover, they are jealous of the peaceful development of the areas governed by the National Government, instigating elements from Chongqing to constantly harass us, in order to hinder the progress of various construction projects, and even directly using their own aircraft, using Chongqing as a base, to repeatedly bomb places like Wuhan and Guangzhou, harming civilians. As for the elements from Chongqing, willingly accepting the manipulation of Britain and America, and acting as traitors to East Asia, they are indeed shameful. However, the fact that Britain and America are scheming against East Asia, exhausting their ability to sow discord, in order to achieve their ultimate desire for annexation, is even more something that East Asian nations should unite against with common hatred. The National Government hereby declares that, from today onwards, it is at war with Britain and America, and will devote its full strength to cooperate with friendly nation Japan, to sweep away the brutality of Britain and America, in order to seek the revival of China, and the liberation of East Asia. The two nations of Manchukuo and Thailand have long maintained friendly relations, and are particularly united in their desire for East Asian co-prosperity. From now on, they should further strive to cooperate, in order to jointly build a new order in East Asia based on morality. The friendly nations of Germany and Italy have, for several years, been confronting British and American forces in the West, and have repeatedly won glorious victories. Our nation now joins the Greater East Asia War, and should echo them, in order to contribute to a just new order for the entire world. All our citizens should know that this is the only opportunity to realize the Great Asianism of our founding father, and that the revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the construction of Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity, and the attainment of justice and peace for the entire world, all depend on this. May we be of one heart and one mind, and exert our efforts from beginning to end, in order to carry out this great mission of this great era!</p>

<p>Nanjing, 8th - Central News Agency Dispatch: Mr. Matsumura, the Vice Minister of the Economic Department of the Mongolian United Autonomous Government, recently issued a statement on the establishment of the credit loan between the Bank of Japan and the Mengjiang Bank, saying that the Bank of Japan's lending of a large amount of credit to Mengjiang, based on the intentions of the Japanese government, fully demonstrates that the Japanese government and the public have thoroughly recognized the sincerity of the officials and people of Mengjiang in fulfilling their special mission and the development of politics and the strengthening of economic power. The government feels satisfied with this and expresses its full gratitude to the Japanese government and the Bank of Japan authorities. Under the Greater East Asia War, the mission undertaken by Mengjiang is becoming more and more important. The government's basic economic construction policy for this year is to increase food production, supply North China with the development of underground resources, enhance the Greater East Asia war effort, rapidly prepare a self-sufficient system for daily necessities, and stabilize people's livelihoods. At present, our officials and people are unanimously gathering all their strength to seek the steady realization of these measures. The establishment of this international credit loan will undoubtedly further stabilize the financial system and provide a great impetus to the construction of Mengjiang. It is believed that the value of the Mengjiang currency will be absolutely stable. It is hoped that officials and people will work together, trust Japan, increase production, save consumption, increase savings, and strive to prosper the paradise.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th - Central News Agency Dispatch: The contract for the 100 million yen credit loan between the Bank of Japan and the Mengjiang Bank has been signed by both parties. The main points of the contract are as follows: Credit Loan Contract, (1) The Mengjiang Bank may borrow 50 million yen in local currency from the Bank of Japan within five years from the date of this contract. (2) The amount borrowed by the Mengjiang Bank may be repaid in one lump sum or in installments at any time within five years from the date of this contract. (3) The repayment period of this loan may be extended after consultation between the two banks.

<p>Rome, 8th - Central News Agency Dispatch: Stefani News Agency reports that a news report published here yesterday detailed the fortifications along the French Mediterranean coast, from Toulon to Menton, and the situation of the Italian Air Force undertaking defense tasks. Toulon is now full of Italian soldiers. There are strong and well-concealed artillery positions near the port, and many defensive positions are scattered everywhere. Similar to the Atlantic coast, every inch of land has the strongest arrangements and is guarded by specially trained elite troops. The beautiful scenery of the Azari coast is world-renowned. After the war, it will be able to restore its original appearance, but at present, the area has become a zone as strong as steel, capable of withstanding any fierce attack.</p>

<h3>Struggle for the Coastal Area of Tunisia Reaches its Fiercest Stage. Axis Forces in Tunisia Retreat in a Fighting Withdrawal, Street Battles in Tunis.</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th - Central News Agency Dispatch: The German High Command officially stated on the evening of the 7th regarding the situation on the Tunisian front that, although the Allied forces had broken through the Axis defenses, the Axis forces were now launching a counterattack on the flanks of the enemy, and fierce fighting was underway. The center of the battle has now shifted to the coastal area. Due to the Axis forces' skillful maneuver warfare, progress has been made between the outer and inner defense lines of the Axis positions. The Axis forces are now resisting the superior enemy forces, holding their positions to the death, to resist the fan-shaped offensive launched by the Allied forces. Under the mobile operations of the Axis defense forces, the enemy has suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>Rome, 8th - Central News Agency Dispatch: The Italian High Command issued a communiqué on the 8th, stating that the resistance of the Axis forces in Tunis and Bizerte has failed.</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th - Central News Agency Dispatch: A German spokesman, at noon on the 8th, explained the situation in Tunisia, stating that the Axis forces had withdrawn from Bizerte after destroying military facilities, but fierce battles were still taking place in Tunis, and most of Tunisia was still under the control of the Axis forces. On the 7th, the Allied forces continued their offensive with superior mechanized units, but the Axis forces immediately counterattacked, frustrating the Allied forces' encirclement attempt. The Allied forces suffered heavy losses in manpower and material resources, and the Axis forces also suffered considerable losses.</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th - Central News Agency Dispatch: The German High Command officially stated at noon on the 7th that the Axis forces on the Tunisian front, with a disadvantage of ten to one, had withdrawn to new positions. Furthermore, the French News Agency quoted Reuters as saying that the Allied High Command announced on the evening of the 7th that the Allied forces had completely occupied the two ports of Tunis and Bizerte.</p>
<p>Berlin, 7th - Central News Agency Dispatch: According to German news agencies from military circles, after the enemy reorganized and redeployed its forces on the northern and central fronts of Tunisia, it launched a new large-scale attack on Thursday. In other words, the most intense struggles at the focal points of the Tunisian front, which had been repeatedly postponed due to the Axis forces' stubborn resistance, have finally begun. The Axis artillery positions controlling the key roads in the war zone met the enemy's advance with fierce artillery fire. The enemy only made slight progress after suffering heavy losses. In this battle, the Axis forces deployed hedgehog formations, bravely resisting the larger enemy force. Fierce fighting is taking place near the coast between the inner and outer circles of the central positions. Disregarding heavy losses, the enemy continues to attack under the cover of tanks and aircraft, but the Axis forces launched a counterattack, which is still in progress. The enemy is using air force units to resist the Axis forces' actions, but the Axis forces, relying on skillful tactics, have divided the entire war zone into several sections on Thursday.</p>
<p>Germany Constructs the Southern Siegfried Line on the Mediterranean Coast</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th - Central News Agency Dispatch: In view of the developments in the Tunisian war, the German Presidential Headquarters is establishing a thorough battle plan, with Sicily and Sardinia as the outer defenses. The Southern Siegfried Line will be constructed on the Mediterranean coast, completing an iron-barrel-like defense. Therefore, as the Tunisian war undergoes a major turning point, the newspapers here are still saying, "The German army has not revealed any signs of wavering, and the mission of the Tunisian front has already ended." Among them, the Berlin Trade News once published, "When the Allies invaded North Africa last November, they said that they would be able to recover the area within a few days. However, due to the Axis forces' courageous fighting, their attempt was completely shattered, and the Allied forces were forced to withdraw to the Algerian border. If the Allied forces want to attack again, they must reinforce a large army for sacrifice. According to the current situation, it can be said that the Allies have reached their intended goal, but it must not be forgotten that it has taken six months. The damage suffered by the Allied forces on the Tunisian front will probably be an obstacle to their operations forever." The German People's News also published that the Axis forces used the past six months of fighting in Tunisia to prevent the Allied forces from launching a second front on the European continent in response to the Soviet winter offensive. The Axis forces used this period to construct an iron wall of defense on the Atlantic coast. This cannot be published for the time being due to confidential reasons. In short, the Axis forces have completed all necessary measures. Therefore, from the overall situation of the war, the gains and losses in Tunisia are completely irrelevant.</p>
<h3>Swedish Foreign Minister Reaffirms Policy of Maintaining Neutrality</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 8th - Central News Agency Dispatch: Swedish Foreign Minister Gunther gave a speech in the Eskilstuna industrial area last night. Sweden's neutrality in the two world wars cannot be said to be fully guaranteed, but we are convinced that neutrality is a useful foreign policy. Gunther's speech was very long, mostly about the legal basis of Swedish neutrality and the history of the country's foreign policy in the recent war. It is said that this war and Swedish foreign policy can be divided into four stages: (1) From the outbreak of the European war to the Norwegian campaign, Sweden tried its best to maintain its foreign trade. (2) From April 9, 1940, when the war approached Sweden's front door, Sweden had to adopt a new attitude, prohibiting countries from passing through, according to the Hague Convention. (3) After Norway was completely occupied, Sweden was surrounded by Germany and the Soviet Union. The Swedish government believed that this situation would last for a considerable period of time, so the relationship with foreign trade had to be greatly changed. Sweden was trapped within the blockade lines of various belligerent countries, so it had to conclude agreements with Germany and the United Kingdom, allowing the passage of German troops and war materials. At the same time, 600,000 tons of Swedish merchant ships outside the blockade line were first chartered to the United Kingdom. Afterwards, the Swedish escort fleet was able to enter and exit Gothenburg, relying on this neutrality policy. (4) Beginning with the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, Sweden allowed a German division to pass through Sweden to Finland. Although this violated the principle of neutrality, it was only limited to once. Since the outbreak of the war, foreign aircraft and warships have often invaded Swedish airspace and territorial waters, especially Soviet submarines. If Sweden did not adopt this neutrality policy, today's situation would be very different. It must be known that every neutral country must have its own policies. If neutrality is to be completely balanced in the relationship between the two belligerent countries, it is naturally impossible. Sweden was forced by circumstances to give other countries a price in order to obtain necessary materials. The price given to Germany was greater than that given to Western European countries, which was unavoidable. It is hoped that the national public will not be misled by rumors and will continue to trust the government's neutrality policy.</p>

<h3>Building Economic Shanghai: Completing Sino-Japanese Co-prosperity</h3>
<p>— Takenouchi Fumin</p>
<p>Mr. Takenouchi Fumin is a renowned economic scholar from the friendly nation of Japan and currently serves as the managing director of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Shanghai. He is familiar with the Chinese economic situation. This article was originally titled "Royal Restoration" for Sino-Japanese relations. The meaning of "Royal Restoration" is akin to the Meiji Restoration. The conclusion calls for building economic Shanghai and ultimately achieving Sino-Japanese economic co-prosperity. His intentions are fair, and his arguments are insightful. Since the shift in Japanese policy towards China on January 9th of this year, the situation here has shown complex and subtle trends. Its concrete impact is seen in both ideological and socio-economic divisions. Roughly speaking, the impact is twofold: one group feels pleased and optimistic, while the other expresses anxiety, grief, and unease. This impact can be further divided into Chinese and Japanese perspectives. Generally speaking, the current situation finds the Japanese side anxious, grieving, and uneasy, while the Chinese side is pleased and optimistic.</p>
<p>Can this be considered the true success of this policy shift?</p>
<p>The true purpose of this thorough policy shift, especially in economic policy, lies in achieving a new Sino-Japanese relationship. It seeks to eliminate the distinction between "us" and "them" in people's minds, aiming for a state of unity between China and Japan. Given this objective, no distinction between light and dark is permissible between China and Japan. I believe the current distinctions are merely transitional turbulence in the pursuit of correcting imbalances and creating a unified Sino-Japanese state.</p>
<p>Seeing the natural relationship between China and Japan necessitates such a view. However, impractical and conflicting theories leading to confusion are unacceptable. Unfortunately, such phenomena still exist among Japanese residents. The true intentions of the government's policies are not yet fully understood, and the implementation of these policies on the ground is not entirely widespread. This situation seems ill-suited for the decisive period ahead.</p>
<p>I have two suggestions to offer to those feeling lost: First, seek truth by escaping from illusions. Second, even in a dreamless life, a grand dream is needed to navigate the tangled Sino-Japanese relations. The bigger the dream, the better. Realizing the vastness of the waves, everyone should have the courage, the willingness to sacrifice, and the perseverance to establish an enduring Sino-Japanese relationship. The darkest hour is nearest the dawn. Being misled by temporary fluctuations would prevent the attainment of the best and greatest achievements.</p>
<p>In this complex and subtle environment, I am reminded of a past event: rowing against the current and the impression of the innovative Meiji Restoration.</p>
<p>The Meiji Restoration, along with the Taika Reform and the Kemmu Restoration, marked major turning points in Japanese history. The first thing that won popular support during the Meiji Restoration was the slogan "Royal Restoration and Expel the Barbarians."</p>
<p>Mori Arinori, who first advocated abolishing swords and marrying in church, also had a peculiar theory: he proposed adopting English as the national language of the new Japan and calling upon the world to do so. Some even suggested abolishing Japanese clothing, requiring everyone to wear Western attire, burning down the entire city of Tokyo, and rebuilding it with Western architecture. Naturally, such strange theories clashed with public opinion. Today, there is a magnificent pagoda by Sawaike Pond in Nara, built solely through ten yen of private donations. However, demolishing it would require a huge sum, so demolition was avoided due to the cost-benefit analysis.</p>
<p>Such unconventional guiding principles were part of the popular "Royal Restoration."</p>
<p>This major shift in Japan's policy towards China is essentially another expression of the Sino-Japanese "Royal Restoration" and the East Asian "Royal Restoration." If that is truly the case, we must realize that the overlapping waves, the joys and sorrows of the "Royal Restoration" of the Meiji era will reappear today, guided by that lofty spirit and the call for innovative change.</p>
<p>The new Sino-Japanese agreement abolished extraterritorial rights and returned concessions that had colonized China, freeing China from a century of shackles and completing the nation's full sovereignty. If this cannot be called a "Royal Restoration," what else could be considered a "Royal Restoration" in China's international history and in the history of Sino-Japanese relations?</p>
<p>Waves and sacrifices are naturally anticipated. The arrow has already left the bow; hesitation, subservience, and retreat will lead to failure. All meanness and bystander attitudes should be cast aside. The spirit of advancing on the path indicated by national policy is the way to survive. Only then can the brilliant iron tower of the Sino-Japanese diplomatic transformation be erected.</p>
<p>Next, our discussion will focus on the economic sphere. The most difficult and contentious aspect of this transformation lies in the economic sphere, where the opposing positions of China and Japan are most evident. Whether or not this economic cooperation succeeds will be the deciding factor in judging the merits of this diplomatic transformation. Let's look at some examples:</p>
<p>First, the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association on March 16th as a unified guiding and controlling body for implementing purchase and distribution. Second, the gradual easing of restrictions on the movement of goods in the Yangtze River Delta region, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. Third, the imminent establishment of the Central China Trade Control Agency, which is closely linked to the National Commercial Control Association. Fourth, the issue of building "Economic Shanghai," which holds the key to the economic revival and construction of all of China. Fifth, using the massive inventory accumulated in Shanghai to stimulate the economy of all of China. Only when this method of utilizing inventory is determined can the scale of the new economic policy after the transformation possess a complete and comprehensive system.</p>
<p>Of the above (3), (4), and (5), the main bodies have not yet been realized. The forms of (1) and (2) have already begun to emerge. Namely, the National Commercial Control Association and the warming of restrictions on the movement of goods, something that could not have been dreamed of since the incident, have already undergone a great change in nature as described below.</p>

<h3>Hua Detectives Involved in the Zhang Jinhai Case Sent to Court for Severe Punishment; French Consular Tribunal Judge Decides to Charge Millet with "Intentional Injury Resulting in Death"</h3>
<p>The case of Qingnian Zhang Jinhai, who was brutally murdered by police officers in the French Concession, has prompted serious protests from the Second Special District Court and the Shanghai Special City Government. Yesterday morning, Luo Junqiang, Minister of Judicial Administration, and Chen Bingjun, President of the Second Special District Court, issued separate statements. The main culprit in the murder of Zhang Jinhai, French Inspector Millet, has been formally indicted after an investigation by the French Concession Consular Tribunal. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Minister Luo's Statement</p>
<p>Minister Luo Junqiang made a special trip to Shanghai to closely monitor the development of the case. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency visited Minister Luo, who graciously received him and issued a statement saying: "The central government attaches great importance to the case of Zhang Jinhai, who was brutally murdered as a result of the abuse of illegal torture by police officers in the French Concession. After arriving in Shanghai, in addition to listening to reports from all parties regarding the case's beginning and end, I immediately ordered my subordinates to argue based on legal grounds to seek a reasonable and fair resolution. This case is a legal issue, not simply a diplomatic one. The French Inspector Millet, the main culprit, is currently being interrogated by the French Consular Tribunal. I will naturally monitor the progress of the case at all times. As for the thousand or so Chinese detectives who participated in the beating to death, they should be transferred to the competent court for severe punishment in accordance with the agreement, so that the deceased's grievances can be redressed and the national law upheld."</p>
<p>President Chen's Statement</p>
<p>Chen Bingjun, President of the Second Special District Court in the French Concession, returned to Shanghai yesterday after a special trip to Beijing to seek instructions on the Zhang case. He also issued a solemn statement to reporters: "The details of the case have been reported in various newspapers. Our court has already reported the autopsy results to the Ministry. Before going to Beijing, I had already lodged a serious protest with the judicial advisor of the French Concession Administration based on the facts. Such brutal behavior is intolerable in terms of law, reason, and human feelings. Our court is determined to adhere to the central government's intentions, argue strictly based on legal grounds, urge the punishment of the murderers, and handle the case impartially to redress the grievances and satisfy public expectations. We will also do our best to persuade the French Concession Administration to improve its measures in the future to ensure the mission of protecting human rights is not disgraced."</p>
<p>Consular Tribunal Investigation Concluded</p>
<p>The group of Chinese and French criminals involved in the murder of Zhang Jinhai have been suspended from their duties by the French Concession Police Department. The French Consular Tribunal has held hearings to investigate. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the French Consular Tribunal summoned the criminals again to continue the investigation. The investigation has been concluded, and French Inspector (the main culprit in the tragedy) Millet has been deemed guilty and formally charged under French criminal law. The other Chinese detectives, including Zhu Songcheng, who participated in the beating of Zhang Jinhai to death, have been transferred to the Second Special District Court for punishment according to law. According to the French side, the group of Chinese criminals were sent to the Second Special District Court yesterday morning before 9:00 AM for preliminary hearing.</p>
<p>Announcement Issued by the French Authorities Yesterday</p>
<p>After the French Consular Tribunal announced the conclusion of the investigation yesterday morning, the French Police Department officially issued a public notice at around 1:00 PM, saying: "The President of the French Consular Tribunal, under the order of the French Consul General and the request of the Police Superintendent, after many days of investigation, has determined that Inspector Millet violated orders and appears to have inflicted violence on Zhang Jinhai. Therefore, this morning (the 8th), the Tribunal judge decided to charge Millet with the crime of 'intentionally injuring Zhang Jinhai in Shanghai on April 29, 1943, although without intending to kill him, but resulting in his death,' under Article 309 of the French Criminal Code." The defendant Millet was formally detained by the French Police Department yesterday to await judgment.</p>
<p>Our National Officials Discuss in Detail</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Special City Government lodged a serious protest with French Consul General Magre earlier, there has been no official statement so far. After the Procuratorate of the Second Special District Court of the French Concession sent a protest letter to French Police Superintendent Fabre, Fabre personally went to the Second Special District Court yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM to meet with Chief Prosecutor Shen Wenjie and made a reply. After Fabre left, Shen went to the City Government to discuss the matter in detail with Mayor Chen and Secretary-General Zhao. At the same time, in order to achieve consistency in our national officials' external steps, he also copied the case's proceedings and the autopsy report of the corpse and sent them to the City Government for reference.</p>
<p>Hearing Postponed</p>
<p>The Chinese detectives, including Zhu Songcheng, who participated in the beating of Zhang Jinhai to death, were transferred from the French Police Department to the Procuratorate of the Second Special District Court yesterday morning at 9:00 AM for investigation. However, due to the simultaneous opening of the French Consular Tribunal, the hearing was postponed.</p>
<p>Family Petition</p>
<p>Zhang Jinhai, an apprentice at the Lafeichengji Sock and Shirt Factory on Caishi Road, was tragically tortured to death by the French Concession Police Department. Zhang's family has been petitioning various authorities and organizations in the city for days to redress the grievances of the deceased, asking for continued assistance and upholding justice. They also express deep gratitude for the strong support for the deceased. Yesterday afternoon, Zhang's family first went to the Journalists Association, where a general membership meeting was being held, to express their gratitude to the city's reporters. Then, they went to the Social Welfare Bureau. The City Party Headquarters, the China Daily, and the Shanghai branch of the Central News Agency were also petitioned. Director Sun Wuqi, Secretary-General Chen, Chief Editor Chu, and Directors Wu and Yang received them separately. It is said that the family will continue to petition various newspapers and agencies in the city today.</p>
<p>Mr. Wen Lantin is seventy-four years old this year. He usually devotes himself to social undertakings and is getting stronger as he gets older, which is deeply admired. However, due to overwork, he fell ill at the end of last year. His energy has not yet recovered after the illness. We are deeply distressed by the fact that Mr. Lan's evening social engagements and conversations are time-consuming and exhausting. Therefore, we advise him to decline evening banquets and rest early to increase his energy and use it for social undertakings, which will benefit both sides. Mr. Lan quite agrees. Therefore, we respectfully inform Mr. Lan's relatives, friends, and old acquaintances that from now on, please do not invite him to evening banquets or visit him in the evening. We hope you will understand.</p>

<h3>35th Period Household Grain: Two Sheng of White Rice or Brown Rice; Announcement of Flour Distribution Method to Be Issued Separately</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department recently issued Public Notice No. 6344, stating that from May 11th to 19th, all rice shops and the Public Works Department's rice sales offices will only issue government rice upon presentation of Coupon No. 35 of the rice purchase certificate.

The matter of issuing flour with Flour Certificate No. 35 will be announced separately. Rice shops and the Public Works Department's rice sales offices will be temporarily closed on May 20th.</p>
<h3>Rumor That Flour Rationing Will Be Conducted by District</h3>
<p>According to the Commercial News Agency, the flour supply for residents in the city has been managed simultaneously by the Public Works Department and the French Concession Public Works Bureau under the per capita food distribution system. It is reported that within the next few days, the authorities will establish a new institution for rationing flour. The organizational system of this new institution will be announced soon. The quantity of flour rationed in the future will be greater than in the past. It is reported that after the establishment of this new flour rationing institution, the entire Shanghai will be divided into sixteen districts. In each district, a designated flour shop or a number of "cooperative sales offices" will be established to handle the rationing. The names and locations of these rationing shops or cooperative sales offices will also be officially announced in the short term. Therefore, the flour needed by Shanghai residents in the future will be more abundant.</p>
<h3>Various Organizations Send Telegrams to the National Government</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai Branch of the East Asia League, the Chinese National Anti-British and Anti-American Association, the East Asia Anti-Communist League, the Chinese Hongmen United Association, the Chinese Construction Youth Corps, the Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association, the Zhenjiang Fellow Provincials Association in Shanghai, and other mass organizations sent telegrams to the National Government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, saying: "Chairman of the National Government in Your Presence, Minister Chu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government in Your Presence, We have found that the case of Zhang Jinhai, an apprentice at the Chengji Sock and Shirt Factory, who was brutally tortured to death by the police station in the French Concession of the city, has aroused public outrage. Foreigners have long relied on extraterritorial rights and concession relations to abuse their powers and disregard human life, which is a great sin. Our associations cannot stand idly by in order to protect human rights and safeguard national dignity. Moreover, the National Government is now working with its friendly nation of Japan to build a new order in East Asia. Shanghai, in a corner, is a place where all people pay attention. It is not allowed to have such an inhuman event that insults the national image. Therefore, we jointly request that Your Excellency immediately lodge a serious protest with the French Concession authorities in Shanghai and demand the fulfillment of the following conditions: (1) All murderers shall be handed over to the Chinese courts for trial. (2) The families of the deceased and the wounded shall be compensated. (3) The French authorities shall apologize to our government. (4) Guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again. In addition to the above four conditions requiring the French Concession to strictly implement them in order to calm public anger, it should also speed up the process of returning the concessions so that the lives and properties of all citizens in the city can be effectively guaranteed. Then all the citizens will be fortunate, and the country will be fortunate. Shanghai Branch of the East Asia League China General Association, Chinese National Anti-British and Anti-American Association, East Asia Anti-Communist League, Chinese Hongmen United Association, Chinese Construction Youth Corps, Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association, Zhenjiang Fellow Provincials Association in Shanghai, etc. salute." At the same time, a statement was also submitted to Mayor Chen of the City Government, making the same appeal.</p>

<p>2.  Regarding the letter from Huang Shiqian and others, tenants of the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank Building, requesting negotiations to exempt them from relocation: Due to the urgency of time, a formal letter in the name of Secretary-General Zheng Ti was sent to the military authorities for direct consultation. The result is that the stores on the ground floor and the two locations at the northern end of Carter Road and west of Jing'an Temple Road will not be requisitioned for the time being.</p>
<p>3.  Regarding the letter from Huang Shiqian, Shi Cheng Sun, Qian Qi Peng, and others of the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank Building, requesting separate letters to the Ministry of the Army and the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, stating that the house will be returned one day and requesting to retain the lease: The letter was forwarded to the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, and it seemed unnecessary to send one to the Ministry of the Army.

<p>(2) Discussion Items</p>
<p>1.  Regarding the Zhang Jinhai wrongful killing case, numerous requests for relief have been received. How should the case be handled?</p>
<p>Resolution: There are special laws for murderers, and the punishment for public officials committing crimes should be even more severe. Since the victim has filed a lawsuit according to law, we should wait quietly for the court's judgment. However, according to reports in various newspapers and letters from the Zhenjiang Association in Shanghai and the victim's father, there is evidence that the French Concession police used private torture. It should be suggested to the French Concession police authorities to immediately abolish such torture to emphasize humanity, etc., and separate letters should be sent. (Rest omitted)</p>

<p>Economic Circle - Commentary</p>
<h3>Rural Loans</h3>
<p>Under the important principle of the "Wartime Economic Policy Outline" that loans should be limited to support production enterprises, we have repeatedly mentioned rural loans, precisely because the reduction in agricultural output is enough to cause economic panic throughout the country and society. Therefore, among the loan sectors of production enterprises, agricultural loans should occupy a primary position.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, in order to revive the countryside and enhance production, has instructed the Bank of Communications to handle rural revival loans. The Bank's rural survey team, organized last year, has completed its on-the-ground survey of rural areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Zhili provinces and is currently studying the methods of agricultural loans.</p>
<p>Regarding this point, we would like to express some opinions from a third-party standpoint. As far as we know, the authorities, in order to assist in the revival of rural production enterprises, will strive to lower the interest rate on rural loans, which is certainly essential. However, we believe that in terms of loan methods, the principle lies not only in lowering the loan interest rate but also in the universalization and directness of the loans. Why is universalization necessary? Because the vast majority of farmers in our country are poor farmers; their lives are the most difficult, and their need for funds is the most urgent. And this vast majority of poor farmers is precisely the driving force for promoting agricultural production; therefore, what we want to assist and support, to make them live in peace and work happily, is this vast majority of poor farmers. Secondly, why is directness necessary? Because in rural areas everywhere, there are always villains and scoundrels mixed in, causing trouble in the middle; loans are most likely to flow into the hands of these people, to carry out their high-interest lending and land speculation activities. In that case, how can genuine farmers obtain the benefits of rural loans? Therefore, the design of loan methods, in addition to paying attention to the universality of loans, must also take direct lending as a prerequisite.</p>
<p>In short, reviving rural production naturally requires agricultural loans as the only means, and the success of agricultural loans still depends on whether the methods, procedures, steps, and implementation of the loans are ideal in every aspect.</p>
<h3>Ministries of Industry and Food Separately Designate Controlled Commodities, Assigned to the General Chamber of Commerce to Handle</h3>
<p>The main commodities handled by the National General Chamber of Commerce under the supervision and guidance of the Ministries of Industry and Food have been determined by orders from the Ministries of Industry and Food. The controlled commodities under the jurisdiction of the Ministries of Industry and Food are listed below:</p>
<p>Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>Designated Controlled Commodities: (1) Cotton, (2) Cotton Yarn, (3) Cotton Products (including cloth and knitwear), (4) Chemical Industrial Products (including raw materials, Western medicines, pigments, dyes, and alcohol), (5) Wool Fabrics and Wool Products, (6) Cocoons, (7) Silk and Silk Products, (8) Industrial Oils and Fats, (9) Candles, (10) Soap, (11) Matches, (12) Lump Coal and Coal Balls, (13) Cigarettes and Tobacco Leaves, (14) Rubber (including raw materials and products), (15) Hardware (including raw materials and products of iron, steel, white iron, and non-ferrous metals), (16) Glass (including raw materials and products), (17) Electrical Appliances (including raw materials and products), (18) Leather (including raw materials and products).</p>
<p>Ministry of Food</p>
<p>Designated Controlled Commodities: (1) Flour, (2) Grains (including wheat, naked barley, barley, corn, peanuts, soybeans, broad beans), (3) Livestock Products (including cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, ducks, and lard), (4) Eggs (including chicken eggs and duck eggs), (5) Sugar (including brown sugar and white sugar), (6) Edible Oil (including peanut oil, rapeseed oil, and cottonseed oil).</p>
<h3>Food Industry - Shanghai Association Organization Completed</h3>
<p>The national commercial control work, under the supervision and guidance of the Ministries of Industry and Food, has already begun to organize control work. The highest authority, the National General Chamber of Commerce, has comprehensively planned the control of various food materials, divided into thousands of departments. There is a department within the General Chamber of Commerce, and externally there is a Federation. Under the Federation, there are local trade associations. The Federations and trade associations in the Shanghai urban area are separately supervised and promoted by the Shanghai offices of the Ministries of Industry and Food. Once the middle-level organization Federation and the lower-level organization local trade associations are completed and integrated with the upper-level National General Chamber of Commerce, the giant wheel of overall material control can begin to turn. At that time, not only will legitimate merchants in various industries be protected, but the general price level will inevitably tend to stabilize. Therefore, the early completion of this control mechanism is what the government and the people are currently jointly looking forward to, and its impact on the future of the war is particularly significant. Minister Gu of the Ministry of Food, due to the slow start of the organization of the middle and lower-level organizations that the Ministry should supervise and promote, is deeply concerned that it will delay the entire control work, so he strictly ordered the responsible personnel stationed in Shanghai to intensify their work and complete it within a time limit. With the instructions of Mayor Chen and the enthusiastic assistance of the General Chamber of Commerce and various parties, all food materials under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Food, except for rice which has separate regulations, including flour, grains, livestock products, eggs, edible oil, and sugar, will have their middle and lower-level organizations fully completed within days.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves Temporary Payment of Current Deposit Reserve Funds by Banks and Pawnshops; Fixed Deposit Reserve Funds Cannot Be Paid with Substitutes</h3>
<p>The Financial Inspection Office of the Ministry of Finance previously instructed, in accordance with the "Provisional Regulations for the Management of Financial Institutions," that banks and pawnshops in this city should pay their current and fixed deposit reserve funds to the Central Reserve Bank. The banks and pawnshops have already paid the reserve amount for fixed deposits in full, but the reserve funds for current deposits have not been paid in accordance with the law due to various reasons. The Banking and Pawnshop Association has submitted four requests to the Financial Inspection Office for approval, including: (1) Temporarily postpone the payment of current deposit reserve funds. (2) Please increase the interest on the reserve funds that have already been paid. (3) Please do not include current deposits under overdraft accounts in the current deposit calculation. (4) Please also allow the payment of fixed deposit reserve funds with 40% cash and 60% substitutes. After receiving the submission, the Financial Inspection Office forwarded it to the Ministry of Finance for instructions. It is now understood that the Ministry of Finance has replied to the four requests made by the banking and pawnshop industry in this city one by one as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The current deposit reserve funds that each bank and pawnshop should pay are allowed to be temporarily postponed for two months (i.e., payment will begin on June 1).</p>
<p>(2) It is inconvenient to increase the interest on the reserve funds that have already been paid.</p>
<p>(3) For current deposits under overdraft accounts, the reserve funds can be paid based on the month-end deposit balance.</p>
<p>(4) Allowing the payment of current deposit reserve funds with a portion of substitutes was originally an accommodation measure, so it is not appropriate to follow suit for fixed deposit reserve funds.</p>
<h3>Municipal Economic Bureau Continues to Designate Promoters for Six Industry Associations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Economic Bureau, in order to adjust the industry associations of industrial and commercial enterprises in this city, has already designated the cotton industry and other ten industry associations to complete their organizations one after another last month. A few days ago, it designated promoters for the pharmaceutical factory industry, alcohol factory industry, match factory industry, and other industrial associations, requiring them to convene and establish organizations within a time limit. Yesterday, it continued to designate promoters for the chemical industrial products industry and six other industry associations in this city, requiring them to complete their organizations within a time limit. The list of promoters for each industry is recorded below:</p>

<h3>Evaluation Committee Implements Standard Price Limits; Violators Will Be Investigated and Dealt with Publicly</h3>
<p>The industry associations in this city, in order to assist the authorities in suppressing the selling prices of all goods, previously established "Evaluation Committees" in their respective industry associations. In addition to being responsible for evaluating and setting standard price limits, they also conducted investigations and distribution matters. It is now understood that the Evaluation Committees of the various associations, in view of the fact that member stores are secretly raising the prices of goods in order to obtain undue profits, which is contrary to the original intention of the evaluation, have decided to convene meetings one after another to review whether the previously set price limits meet the standards, and secretly send personnel to the front offices of various member stores to conduct close investigations. If it is found that the marked prices are raised, or if the goods are not sold according to the limits, the investigators will copy down the store number, address, item name, etc., and send them to the association. Then, the Evaluation Committee will discuss the punishment methods. It is also understood that in the future, the distribution and procurement matters will be handled by the industry associations or a group directly under them, so the responsibility of the associations has become more complicated than in the past.</p>
<h3>Dynamics of Various Industry Federations</h3>
<p>Flour Industry: The National Federation of Flour Industry Associations, with Sun Zhongli and others designated by the Ministry of Food as preparation directors, is actively preparing. It is now ready and will convene a founding meeting at 3 p.m. tomorrow (10th) on the second floor of 43 Jiangxi Road. All districts must send representatives to attend in order to complete the organization. The association includes nine districts: Shanghai, Jiangsu, Northern Jiangsu, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Jiahu, Northern Anhui, Southern Anhui, and Eastern Zhejiang, all of which have sent personnel to Shanghai to report to the association as scheduled.</p>
<p>Commercial and Industrial Products Industry: The National Federation of Commercial and Industrial Products Industry Associations, with Xie Meisheng and Liu Bin designated by the Ministry of Food to be responsible for preparations, has been ready and will hold a founding meeting at 2 p.m. on the 12th of this month in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and elect the first board of directors and supervisors to be responsible for promoting association affairs. The industry associations in Jintai, Tongzhou, Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, Jindan, Nanjing, Bengbu, Anqing, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Suxi, Changtai, and other districts must send personnel to Shanghai on time in accordance with the newly promulgated Provisional Regulations for Industrial and Commercial Industry Associations and the Organizational Rules for the Food Industry Association to maintain the rights and interests of the industry.</p>
<p>Department Store Industry: Li Ze, who is in charge of preparing the Department Store Industry Federation, convened the first preparatory meeting on the 6th of this month to ensure the early establishment of the association after receiving the order from the Ministry of Industry. In addition to the attendance of the preparatory committee members, Supervisor Chen Zhong and Guo Shun, Supervisor of the National General Chamber of Commerce, and Lu Fengjiu, Deputy Director, also attended the meeting for guidance. Li Ze, Zheng Zhaobin, Li Kangnian, Ba Lingyun, Zhang Wenkui and other five people were appointed to be responsible for drafting the articles of association, and the second preparatory meeting was scheduled to be held on the 13th of this month. The Huuanqiu Goods Industry Association on the fourth floor of Wing On Department Store on Nanjing Road is temporarily used as the temporary preparatory office.</p>
<p>Fresh Pork Industry: After the Shanghai Fresh Pork Industry Association was ordered to reorganize, it convened a general meeting of all members at 3 p.m. yesterday at the Ningbo Road Fresh Meat Industry Association, and publicly elected Chu Jiasheng as chairman, and instructed industry members to register with the Shanghai Municipal Food Bureau on schedule. Then, the meeting discussed the revision of the association's charter, and re-elected Sun Bingquan, Chu Jiasheng and other fourteen people as directors. It is reported that fresh pork vendors from various provinces, cities, districts and counties who are stationed in Shanghai must also join as new members, and should complete the membership procedures as soon as possible, obtain a member registration certificate, and then follow the registration of the Food Bureau and apply for registration within a time limit, and then obtain formal membership.</p>
<h3>Hua Share Trend</h3>
<p>Hua shares were quiet, mainly because it was Saturday, and people were holding steady. Only Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory shares in the new pharmaceutical industry were in high demand and short supply, with significant progress. The price of Sino-French Pharmacy shares has returned to small. The World Book Company in the cultural industry also has news of returning to the factory on the 15th of this month, and the transaction was not weak. Commercial Press and China Bookstore were both flat. Xinxin Company in the department store industry saw a slight decrease, Guohuo Company rose slightly, and the transaction price of Wing On Company was similar to the previous day. Wing On Textile Factory and Meya Silk Factory were both traded sparsely and the prices were stagnant. In the public utilities industry, Zhabei Water and Electricity rose slightly, and no one cared about China Electric. Nanyang Tobacco and Great China Matches rose slightly, and Jiu'an Industrial and Xin'yi Real Estate were stagnant.</p>
<h3>Purchase of Wool Yarn Requires Application to the Association; Applicants Limited to Adult Women; Goods Will Be Collected from Stores After Approval</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Wool Yarn Industry Association, in view of the scarcity of wool yarn inventory in the market, in order to prevent unscrupulous merchants from hoarding and profiteering, and in order to save wartime materials, has specially formulated restrictions on purchase methods, which have already been implemented. All wool yarn stores have uniformly stopped over-the-counter transactions. If citizens want to purchase wool yarn and it is indeed for their own use and indispensable, they can obtain a wool yarn purchase application form from the association. Applicants are limited to adult women and must show a citizen's certificate. Underage women and men are not allowed. After filling out the application form, submit it to the association for review. If it is qualified, the association will indicate the approved quantity and the name of the issuing store on the application form, and also notify the store. The applicant can go to the designated store with the approved application form to pay and collect the goods.</p>
