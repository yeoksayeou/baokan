<h3 id="c1">民力動員與民衆教育 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>戰時一切政策的中心，在於國力的集中，作有計劃有組織的運用，所以物力和財力的動員，便爲政府當局所重視，從戰時經濟政策綱領到一切物資統制，物價限制等等，都不外爲使國力作更有效的運用，而求國策的貫澈。但我們始終認爲一國國力中最基本的力量，還是人力，尤其是大多數人民的覺醒力。凡是現代賢明的政府，都注意到「喚起民衆」的工作，尤其在戰時，特別重視人民的覺醒力。</p>
<p>「喚起民衆」的重要性旣如此，但喚起民衆這件工作却並不容易，尤其不能僥倖成功。因爲要「喚起民衆」，就必須面向民衆，深入民間，認眞的去體察民間的疾苦，解決人民的困難，在適當的敎育和訓練中，纔能把民衆眞正的喚起，而組織起來。而且，眞正要喚起與組織民衆，決不能像重慶政權那樣把許多人的辮髮結在一起，使其不得隨便散去的辦法，也不僅是一篇宜言和幾句口號所能成功的。但看日本所以能够打敗英美，當然要歸功於軍隊，　是軍隊要歸功於誰呢，豈不是數十年來軍國民敎育的收穫嗎？而且很顯然的，日本的戰勝英美，還表現在對於一般國民的敎育，訓練和組織上面，只有深入民衆，啟迪民智，才能眞正喚起民衆，動員民力，而完成總力戰的態勢。</p>
<p>我們要爭取大東亞戰爭的最後勝利，我們還要經過更艱難困苦的奮鬥階段，目前我們所感受的困苦，還差得很違。並且，這是對於我們這個有五千年歷史的古老的中國，確是很好的　練。因此，我們現在必須充分的準備，廣大的人力，一定要澈底的動員起來，凡是對勝利存着僥倖的心理，對困苦存着茍免的心理；那麼，都會使前途的困苦增加，而遭遇到我們想像不到的現象。</p>
<p>怎樣能養成人民的健全的戰降意識，怎樣喚起民衆，組織民衆，以達到動員民力，完成國策的任務呢？根本的對症下藥，自然要從改善和推進國民敎育與民衆敎育着手：第一，要發展國民識字運動，澈底消除文盲。我國文盲，佔全人口百分之八十以上，這樣多的人民，連本國的文字也不認識，對於國家社會和世界大勢，自然更談不到了。不知不覺無知無識的人民，在平時已為政策推行的障礙，在戰時更不能發揮國家的力量，這是必須由政府明白確立對策，限時限地的實現，肅清文盲運動，庶與肅清疫病和盜匪同等的重視。第二，普通發展職業與補習教育。前者在於對一切有志人士，不分性別，搜以戰時生產各部門的基礎知識與技能，在短時間內，培養成大批生產的戰士。後者是對一般有職業的人員或失學成人與靑年，授以新時代國民的基礎知識，使對國家社會及世界大勢，有明白的認識，對於自己的地位和責任有正確的了解。第三，政治，軍事，警察，民衆運動，經濟，文化敎育各部門展開幹部訓練運動。舉凡上述各部門的各級工作人員，都應參加適當的各種幹部訓練班，經過一定時期的訓練，合格後才能確保其職位，或調遷其適人適地的新職。爲了不妨礙原有工作，自可採用輪流的受訓制度。同時，今後各部門需用新人，都需從幹部訓練班吸收人才。至於訓練的內容，一是各部門的業務，知識，及技能；二是國際知識與戰時法令等；三是服務道德。</p>
<p>一切動員計劃的實施，總力參戰的實踐，唯一的主要因素是人力。喚起民衆是今日最緊要的政治任務，而推進民衆敎育却是實踐這一政治任務的前提。我們爲此特別提出這一點，深願有關各方面展開討論和共策進行。</p>

<p>德元首行營十九日海通社電　據德軍司令都宣稱、德機在東綫唐納資河流域、卡科夫、奧萊爾及伊爾門湖區域等處甚爲活躍、髙加索西部及庫班河下流解凍後、僅有小接觸、德軍在諾伏洛西斯克以南繼續推進、蘇軍在唐納資河流域及卡科夫區域進攻、均於劇戰後被擊退蘇軍在奧萊爾東南進攻多次、均被擊退、且損失坦克車數輛、德機轟炸敵軍、甚爲得手、蘇軍在伊爾門湖東南繼續猛攻、損失慘重、蘇軍雖有坦克車及飛機助戰、但在各處進攻德軍陣地時、均被擊退、蘇軍在拉多加湖以甫及列寗格勒區進攻、亦被擊退、傷亡甚多、蘇軍一隊被擊潰、西班牙志願兵作戰甚爲得手、茂曼斯克市區及海港、均遭轟炸、</p>
<p>柏林十九日海通社電　城市中之巷戰、往往使守軍遭受極重大之犧牲、蘇軍基於傳統之習慣、喜爲卷戰、而德軍爲珍惜人力起見、實不屑爲之、卡科夫之撤退、動機　在於此、今自該城撤退之德軍、已可調往廣大戰區從事較有流動性之戰爭、所獲得之軍事上的效果、自必遠較困守城中爲大、今之卡科夫迤西一帶、激戰尙在進行中、敵軍正向波爾塔瓦一帶推進、敵方在卡科夫之軍隊似已有一部份撤至他處、擬在唐納資盆地及尼泊河河套一帶作戰、此固東戰塲南路最重要之地區也、塔干洛格灣以北及唐納資盆地西部之德軍方按已定計劃撤退、庫班區及塔曼半島一帶、形勢亦正如是、</p>

<p>教訓震醒　歐人迷夢</p>
<p>吾人此時不應追根尋源、再作無謂之討論、今日之功過當留待後人加以論斷、時不待人、吾人　立即採取迅速而澈底之行動矣、斯達林格勒之戰、實已爲德國人民最大之警吿、此次冬季戰爭之敎訓、當已震醒歐洲人民之迷夢、布爾希維克之執政者、以其嚴密之手段、掩飾其國　、致開戰之初、吾人對其作戰潛力、未能作準確之估計、時至今日、其作戰力量之龐大乃透　於外、故吾人今非以全國之力量與之周旋不可、德國與歐洲所受布爾希維克之威脅已深不亞於東　德國當　所應注意　、　為下述三點、（一）倘德軍未　征服　危機、德國與歐洲將先後受布爾希維克主義之蹂躪、（二）但德軍與德國今與友邦駢肩作戰、確有爲歐洲挽還此殆局之力量、（三）今危機已迫、故吾人須認淸現實、以有效方法對付之、德國倘被赤化、則知識階級及領袖階級必先被肅淸、並將勞工階級驅之爲布爾希維克猶太人之奴隸、全歐其他各國亦將繼之受其荼毒、</p>
<p>團結始能　抵禦危機</p>
<p>布爾希維克能止於吾人疆界之前、不再蔓延、無人能信之、克林姆宮與英美諾言之保證、全不可靠、吾人均已認識現實之危機、德國人民決不甘願受此迫害、　不願乞憐於人、倘世間兵力最强之德國尙不能征服此赤禍、問世間再有何國能負此艱鉅？歐洲目前之中立國、均無稍事抵抗之力量、蘇聯之機械化部隊、能在數日之內、至各國蹂躪、倘歐洲眞落於蘇聯之手中、　英美亦將無能爲力矣、且屆時倫敦能保其止於歐洲間不再渡越海峽吾？職是之故、歐洲決不能再容共分裂、須在新秩序與軸心國領導之下、團結一致、然後始能以軍事力量抵禦蘇聯、侵入歐洲、今日之德國人人均不作妥協之想、全國人民均已抱定堅苦作戰之意志、但尙望全歐注意及此、今日之危機非德國一國所受、全歐均身受之、布爾希維克利用國際猶太人在歐洲滋擾、德國洞燭其奸、故揭竿而起、不惜與之作戰、誓必加以撲滅、決不中途屈服、此乃國社主義所應盡之義務、今戰事已發展至最髙峯德國決小動搖鬥志、必以勝利結束此次戰爭、</p>
<p>抑低生活　加强力量</p>
<p>郭培爾權謂、戰前聯聯從事重大軍事準備、蘇聯人民二十五年來所受之痛苦、即係由此造成、如欲克服布爾希維克危險、祇有利用蘇聯之方法以打擊蘇聯之一法、德國民族、今已遭逢此次戰爭中最嚴重之問題、必須冒極大之危險、以保護其所有並取得將來之所需、吾人不惜再事抑低生活程度、以加强吾人之防禦力量、今全面戰爭之時期業已到來、吾人低估危險之程度、故未曾使用全力應戰、今則必須全力以赴矣、我國及吾人支配下歐洲之資源、必須澈底予以開發、德國人民、以血肉之軀爲保障歐洲而犧牲、歐洲自亦應以勞力爲交換、今日歐人中有尙未明瞭吾人作戰之用意者、他日必將長跽於吾人之前、謝過不遠、吾人使用之方法、母庸論共優劣、而應論其是否成功、凡屬德人、務須供獻最積極之援助、不論貧富上下、均應從事同一之工作、爲獲得最後勝利、當盡更大努力、以全力供獻元首、使其得在春夏來臨之日、再度發動攻勢、一舉而毀滅布爾維克、</p>
<p>奢侈設備　均予停閉</p>
<p>德國人民僅應以戰爭爲念、不應思及其他、如此方可使戰爭縮短、最廣大而最積極之戰爭、亦爲最短期之戰爭、全面動員之際、一切奢侈設備、均當予以停閉、惟電影院、音樂廳等、爲調節工人精神所必需、自當繼續存在、當前之急務、在使前綫兵士、一心從事戰爭、軍火工廠工人、一心從事生產、目前之措施、乃爲戰爭時期之緊念措施、中等階級、雖將因此最蒙不利、但一至戰後、即可恢復、爲應付東歐及英美之威脅起見、此固不得不然之計、英·美如敢試作登陸企圖、定必遭逢迎頭之痛擊、德國人民不顧湯火之險、願供元首指揮、日·義·友邦、迭予敵方以打擊、吾人取信最後勝利非我莫屬、一至春季到來、敵人即可知吾人之進攻力量、已發揮至如何程度矣、</p>
<p>德國民族　表明態度</p>
<p>最後郭培爾提出各種問題、若諸位深信必獲最後勝利乎、決赴湯蹈火、追隨元首乎、決以全力在前後方繼續準備作戰乎、元首如要求每日工作十四至十六小時、願意服從乎、對元首之信仰、較往日愈爲堅定乎、贊成取締偷閒取巧之徒乎、同意於不論貧富上下、享同一權利、盡同一義務之原則乎等、每發一問、聽衆均報以歡呼、郭培爾即稱、所問各則、諸位均已置答、諸君　德國人民之一部份、整個德國民族之態度、已可由此見之、吾人工作之際、已可不受阻碍矣、吾人謹允以全國之力量供獻元首及前敵將士、深信最後勝利必屬於我、國家之興、必遇風暴、此吾人之座右銘也、</p>

<p>（朝日新聞守山特派員十一日柏林電）德國參謀本部，料定被　於史達林城之第六軍無望出險，乃下決心撤退高加索之德軍，撤退之際，得力於第六軍之英勇抵抗，阻止蘇方髙加索部隊之進擊，故髙加索之德軍，約有三分之二順利退出，未受若何損害，其時德軍之作戰目標，旨在羅斯多夫，伏洛希洛夫城，庫爾斯克一帶築成鞏固防綫，以阻紅軍，無意於他處，故願放棄髙加索及頓河一帶之曲折地段，全綫蘇軍在過在二個半　中，備嘗艱困，整頓攻勢，但結果未能償願。北部方面之庫爾斯克陣地先遭危機，南部方面頓河口之要　羅斯多夫亦受德方　中攻擊，衆認德軍參謀本部曾在其時下最大決心，可見於德當局九日之說明：</p>
<p>「德軍爲戰略上關係，決定放棄去夏獲得之髙加索及頓河地域，刻正開始有計劃之移轉中。」</p>
<p>去年開始攻勢之地點，自亞速海岸之達琅洛格北上，連接史達里諾，卡爾科夫之一帶，今次德軍將回向去年之出發綫退下，或將爲獲得冬季防綫之立足點而移轉陣地至西方，德軍之目前方針，暫時冷靜，以待紅車之軍火不濟，將士疲應而無力進取，而　方則保持今春第三次攻勢之立足點。德國之前鋒將七與後方國民，莫不含悲忍淚，臥薪嘗胆，舉國動員趕造大量新型武器，以備今春殲滅紅軍之抵抗力量。在戰塲之氣候，約在三月中旬起厚雪可溶，機械化部隊方能進擊，距今尙有五週。</p>
<p>目下之氣候，髙加索方面零度左右，自羅斯多去至羅堀夫一帶之中部方面，氣候最寒，平均在零下十八度半至二十三度，北部之列寗格勒稍溫，約在零下七度左右。</p>
<p>刻在激戰之羅斯多夫至庫爾斯克一帶，在冬戰塲中爲天時氣候最不利於德軍之戰塲，速日在冰天雪地中浴血作戰。最近德方之印刷品中，有一頗有興趣者，即硏究在　　　德軍對蘇戰，認冬戰塲之氣候，夏天適宜於德軍進攻，冬天適宜於蘇軍進攻，德軍熟讀此法，認爲千古不移之名言。按去夏之作戰，蘇軍採取退避戰法保全實力，以備冬季攻勢。當初在第一次攻勢中，痛擊蘇方野戰軍，德方雖殲紅軍數百萬，但未防敵方之重振抵抗力量，在第二次攻勢中，僅佔其廣大土地，未能破壞其戰鬥力量，故德軍已覺悟今後繼續對蘇作戰時，應避免以土地爲目標之戰略，必須如第一次攻勢之努力擊滅穌聯野戰軍主力。預料今夏德軍之第三次攻勢目標，亦必注重於此點。（任：譯自二月十三日朝日新聞）</p>

<p>（ＯＯ基地高原海軍報道班員十三日發）企圖反攻所羅門　島而出動的美國主力艦隊，終於不是日本海軍機的對手。由戰艦，巡洋艦，驅逐艦組成的敵軍大艦隊，一月二十九日，三十日，在稜湼爾島洋面，受到致命的慘敗，而散潰遁走。帝國海軍部隊之光榮的傳統的閃擊，在夏威夷，馬來洋面，珊瑚海，所羅門海，南太平洋諸海戰之外，又加上了新的勝利之一頁。敵戰艦二艘，輕巡洋艦三艘，被擊沉於太平洋的海底。稜湼爾島洋面海戰中榮獲勝利的是日本海軍航空機。這次海戰進行中的洋面，即係去秋日本戰艦最後被挫的附近，今由海軍航空隊勝利而得以復仇。此次攻擊中實施的薄暮閃擊，尙爲開戰以來的第一次，果敢無比的日本海軍機，克服了所有的一切困難，而獲得成功，在大東亞戰史此尙爲新的記錄。今由當地的航空部隊獲悉該海戰的詳報如次：</p>
<p>日本索敵機，連日在南太平洋作嚴密的哨戒飛行，於二十九日晨發見敵主力部隊，在所羅門羣島南端的桑克里斯特貝爾島南方洋面集合北上聲中，於是立卽發出了「敵主力部隊發見！」的第一報。美軍備置了得意的輪型陣，前後左右配以騙逐艦嚴密警戒，戰艦三　艘前行，後隨甲級巡洋艦三艘，及乙級巡洋艦數艘，洋面上殘留着白色的航跡，向前進攻中。索敵機不住的打電報告其行蹤，基地得到這報告後，空氣立即緊張起來，全軍聚精會神，注意敵艦隊的行動，等候出擊的命令。敵主力部隊不知其是否獲悉我方的注意，仍一路向西北繼續航行中，連絡　乃踴躍向敵陣起飛，基地發出了轟學的命令，飛行員拚死的面色，溢於言表，氣候順適無礙，準備片刻，推進機即開始怒吼，於部隊長的「祝諸君成功」聲中。Ｎ少佐Ｈ少佐各率一隊？相繼自基地起飛，旋擬利用運暮的時機，攻其無備，一舉而加以擊滅。</p>
<p>ＯＯ島附近氣候黯暈，雲陣低佈〇百公尺的天空，薄暮的夕陽，掩蓋着洋面，視綫狹近，轟炸機隊乃降落雲層之下，搜索敵人，似鷹準　矚視海面，編隊向預定發見敵的地點一意進發，指揮官並向連絡機報告「預定於〇〇時〇分開始攻擊。」</p>
<p>當此一刹那，似有神助，灰唁的海面上，有數條航跡，可藉以辨認，距中尉用望遠鏡向遼遠的彼方眺望時，發見了黑點，於是振翼而前，想看淸所發見的東西，指揮官機也同時發見航跡，立即整隊向該航跡追蹤，髙度漸漸降低，在夜幕的籠罩下，稀疏的航跡愈增其灰白的顏色，在白色航跡的盡頭浮沉着艟艟黑影。各機發見敵艦後，感奮地立即準備了攻擊的姿態，時在日落後的〇〇分，天還沒有全黑，尙在西方殘留着朦朧的畫色，轟炸機隊的背後，恰有暗雲掩護，這還不算是絕好的攻擊機會，敵尙不知自身的末日已追於眉睫，防禦砲火完全沒有’出擊的凖備Ｎ大尉的一隊抓住這千載一時的良機，對敵主力艦突加猛製，轟炸機在〇〇公尺髙度，越過敵驅逐艦的上空前進，敵至此尙未還擊。敵的巨艦爲本隊的目標，用全速力進飛，向敵艦艦首瞄準，發射必中的魚雷，這時候，敵始倉皇打開防空砲火的砲門。夜色已深了，海面上一面散佈着血紅的火花。Ｎ大尉的魚雷，準確地命中敵艦的致命處，在Ｎ大尉這一隊的前後，Ｎ少佐，Ｔ中尉等幾隊，也都向敵艦列突進，以敵的巨艦爲目標，從驅逐艦·巡洋艦·戰艦所還擊的防禦砲火，反成爲　著的指示，從砲火交織的烈焰　中鑚進，眼前出現了漆黑似一座小山般的戰艦，魚雷似冰雹般擲落。有幾枚魚雷，向二號艦射擊，那恰是敵的旗艦。Ｏ中尉這一隊則選擇　護衛此二號艦的甲級巡洋艦爲其目標，熟練的魚雷，正確地命中甲級巡洋艦，頃刻間艦首上昇，下沉於黑暗的海底。各機任務完成後，在熾烈的敵防禦砲火中退避。敵艦的艦橋飛向天空，殘剩的艦　及驅逐艦，另外又組成了殘缺不全的艦列。</p>
<p>當轟炸機隊橫過敵艦列而退避時，敵艦的集中砲火傾注，Ｍ二飛曹頭部中彈粉碎，在機上壯烈戰死，Ｎ少佐的臀部，似覺痺麻而痛。有一彈貫穿電信機，更貫穿座席而傷少佐的臀部。從防禦砲火的綱中脫出而完成避退時，夜幕已經降下了。在黑暗中，繼這一編隊而續來　Ｈ少佐隊又殺到，以敵艦的火燄爲目標，魚雷集中於燃燒中的敵二號艦，指揮官機奮不顧身，期以必中，而在敵前反復旋回，投擲魚雷，所以在擲下魚雷的一霎那，機體被敵彈命中而起火，Ｈ少佐機早知有此，乃壯烈地與機同時降落自爆，敵二號艦經此猛攻，全艦起火，終於化爲海底的藻屑。</p>
<p>在黑闇中，盲目向基地飛還，機尾的所發出燈光，被基地瞥見，遂射出探照燈照耀於飛機塲，機隊遂得以相次降陸。指揮官報吿部隊長的聲音，低闇猶如死去復活的人的聲音。Ｎ少佐被傷的敵彈，被指揮官機發現，那是細長的鋼鐵彈，這一次攻擊，日方的犧牲，連Ｈ少佐機在內，共〇架。翌晨（三十日）出動的索敵機，又發見負傷的敵艦一艘，與曳航的巡洋艦。ＯＯ基地待機中的航空部隊，接到轟炸的命令，命其捕捉瓜達卡納兒島南方，由克拉曼戰鬥機守護的，以速力四·五海浬，漏夜南下中的敵戰艦。〇〇時〇分轟炸機隊開始突擊，負傷的戰艦，向右傾斜，全艦被掩於火而沉沒。巡洋艦亦同樣化爲火海，艦尾浸水，沒入海底。而掩護　克拉曼戰鬥機亦在空戰中擊墜三架，樹立了南海光榮的勝利記錄。這天未歸還機有〇架，與前天合計，犧牲於此戰績中的合計十架。（翔：譯自二月十四日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<p>食油停售　黑市俏漲</p>
<p>對於此項傳說、官方於昨日並未予以證實或吾認、雖然若輩承認現在之糖油紛亂現象、若由市政當局辦理計口授給制、即可予以消除、據云木埠大多數居民、對於食油一項配給、極感需要、因自最近二週來之斷檔大衆所受痛苦、殊爲重大、溯於舊曆新正以來、食油停止出售、致使黑市價格趨最髙峯、雖然本月初上海食油同業批發處、發出若干關於計口授給制之通吿、惟終未成爲事實、</p>
<p>食糖配給　可能實現</p>
<p>法租界外僑於最近已獲得第三次之配給食糖、凡執有麵包證者、可領購食糖四磅、至於其他市政區域居民、則自一月底憑捐票購糖以來、迄未獲得另一次之配給、據云食糖雖未如食油之重要、但市政當局之辦理計口授給事宜、於不久期間、確有實現可能、據云若干時期以前、市政當局曾籌劃一配給食糖辦法、依照需要程度而規定分配量云、</p>
<p>本年食糖　充沛無虞</p>
<p>本市食糖供應、經糖商合作營業處統籌配給以來、事變後華商食糖存底、已逐漸吿竭、一月份因廢歷年關關係、社會需糖殷切、是以該處曾發配五萬包、藉資應付、本月份之供應數量則僅二萬包左右、糖之存底僅餘八九萬包、至多維持至本年五六月間、將有中斷之處、該糖商合作營業處爲充裕本市食糖存底計、已向友邦方面設法購取十萬包、遂使本年食糖可無處匱之、蓋總計食糖約在二十萬包左右云、</p>

<p>銀業自稱　代人受過</p>
<p>據某一代表吿記者、此次銀樓業因酌提飾金售價、而遭當局嚴厲之處分、實際上堪稱無辜、蓋以金業公會及銀樓業公會、對各該業行情市價、每日均各據實呈報工部局公會課、以資查核、銀樓業櫃售飾金價格、旣係根據市塲合法之賣買而定、自非銀樓業本身所可壟斷操縱、甚盼當局對條金市價、能予盡力敉平、此後各銀樓當可不致代人受過云、</p>
<p>提高限價　未蒙批准</p>
<p>記者昨特向工部局當局探詢、對於各銀樓要求寬放掛牌每兩赤烚三千元限價事、據悉工部局調査物價執行委員會、昨日下午二時、並舉行常會、對違反限價、嚴厲懲處政策、賡續執行、不准變史限價、其他各業所定限價、依然嚴厲執行、如有違抗超越限價、仍當斷然處置、決不寬貸、按烚赤漲勢動輒有數千元之鉅、如不嚴厲限制、則影響百物漲風、難以抑制云、</p>

<p>座談會記錄</p>
<p>昨日交通當局公佈改善北站進口秩序辦法以後，本報即代旅衆表示感謝。同時，更盼望當局不斷謀求改進，達到最理想的境地：並盼望旅衆繼被報吿改善後之旅况，隨時建議切實辦法，提供當局參攷。</p>
<p>但在本月十六日，本報以僅憑着讀者報吿，對於事實之佐證，尙嫌不足。深覺有實地視察之必要，曾發信邀請關心社會問題之中日人士，準備於昨日下午出發北車站視察，恰於先一日當局發表改進辦法，同人：覺得前此擬議之實地視察計劃，其目的與任務，可謂已達到一大部份，遂臨時中止，改爲座談會，承蒙友邦日本方面吉田（反英美協會），平尾（朝日新聞），板谷（新申報），大塲（讀賣新聞）諸先生，及張一矚，李權時，陸髙誼諸先生，親自參加曁本報記者三人，交換意見，歸納結論，有如下列：</p>
<p>期望於交通當局者</p>
<p>（一）車站應多設出入口處所，並應分道。</p>
<p>（二）檢査行李處，應多派憲警執行，檢査處所，應在站屋外，設置矮櫃台，上裝雨棚，檢査物件，切勿放置地上，愛護旅客行李，應與愛護自己行李，同樣心情。</p>
<p>（三）售票窗口，儘量多設，除大部份規定時間啟閉外，應再指定兩處，分售頭二等及三四等客票，自天明至深夜，隨時售票。</p>
<p>（四）每一售票窗口外面，應將値班售票人員之號數，姓名，用白底黑字，在小木牌上標明。</p>
<p>（五）乘客與起票行李，應分道入月台。</p>
<p>（六）在市內適中地點，分設售票處，或委託旅行社，大旅社等代辦。</p>
<p>（七）設置旅客意見報吿箱。</p>
<p>（八）不時舉行茶會，邀集各界代表，提供改良意見。</p>
<p>（九）編輯鐵路旅行須知，多多印發，並在報上披露，使旅衆明瞭旅行概要。</p>
<p>（十）各髙級當局，不妨常常便服混入旅衆，體騐一切。</p>
<p>（十一）鐵路職工，應視旅客爲顧主，待以禮貌，即有乞丐購買四等票搭車，亦應同樣以禮貌相待，旅客如有不明秩序之處，亦應善爲指導。</p>
<p>（十二）嚴禁脚夫索取額外小費（如嚮導費及規定搬運費以外之小費等）。</p>
<p>期望於旅客大衆者</p>
<p>（一）出入口，勿爭先恐後，自相推擁；並讓老弱婦孺先行。</p>
<p>（二）儘量少携行李，節省檢査時間。</p>
<p>（三不利用週身夾帶販賣物件，（例如某次有來自常州之婦女一批，腹部陸起，詢之均稱有孕，但事實上均藏猪肉數斤，販賣圖利，不免影響眞正旅客）。</p>
<p>（四）遵守鐵路公布之一切規章，並服從鐵路職工之善意指導。</p>

<p>一學期又巳屆滿，瞻望來茲，其困苦當更甚於今日。我掙扎於飢餓綫上之敎育同志，又將如何以善其後，庶免於凍餒，而得稍盡其心力於所事。增加學費，提髙待遇，當爲不移之論。然學費之增收，在開學之初，或覺已可，迨乎數月以後，又覺不數甚巨矣。</p>
<p>我人目前最感困難者，厥爲生活必需品之匱乏，戶口米麵當不敷甚多，油糖亦然，即其他日用品如肥皂，毛巾，鞋襪等，無一能爲我人力所能及，極爲顯然，是故特種分配，實屬迫要。就目前上海情形而論，服務於兩租界及市區等機關之從粱員，皆有額外之分配，此所以使其服務安心，效能始有提髙之望。即松江蘇州等處，及共他淸鄉地區，亦有合作社之組織，凡屬社員，皆得享受類似額外分配之權，實行以來，成效卓著。是故上海市敎育事業從業員，有自行組織合作社，向當局請求特種額外分配之必要與可能：明達之當局，定能予以考量，加以有力之援助，使此福利事業卒底於成。</p>
<p>所謂特種額外分配，米麵當屬首要，油糖肥皂等日用所需，亦在其列。如是則除數量之增加外，價格亦可不受黑市操縱之累，嘉惠於敎育從業員者，實匪淺鮮。其影響所及，不僅敎育從業員生活之安定，敎育效能之無形提髙，社會之不寗，可逐趨穩定也。惟茲事體大，決非敎育從業員一部門之力所能及，必須合數種助力，始能早觀厥成。上海市敎育協會，兩租界及市區等處之敎育指導機關，皆應加以領導，而我敎育從業員本身，更應加倍努力，救自身，即所以救社會。</p>

<h3 id="c61">菲律賓的今昔 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— 選民</p>
<p>政治與財政金融</p>
<p>美國自一九八年，從西班牙人手中奪取菲律濱的全權以後，就派總督駐在馬尼拉，統治全菲，實爲變相的殖民地政權。後來因爲爲了促進本國經濟繁榮，爲了相當滿足菲島人民的需要，於一九三四年允許菲島在短時期內獨立，通過議案，規定在一九三六年完成憲法，呈報美總統批准，在菲島獨立政府成立後十年，美國完全放棄對菲的任何政權。到了一九三五年，即已通過新憲法，選舉奎松爲第一任總統，建立獨立政府。大總統掌理立法，行政，司法三權。</p>
<p>（一）立法權係依憲法規定，歸屬於國民議會，國民議會採一院制，由任期三年的一百二十名公選議員組成。每年舉行常會一次，審議法律案及預算案，但一切依照美國議會制，國民議會得派議員一人爲駐美委員，在美國議會中占一席位，以菲律濱代表之資格而賦與發言權。地方議會計有馬尼拉，盤基，宿務，怡如，納那，三寳顏大六都市的市參事會，其他各州有州參事會，各村有村參事會。</p>
<p>（二）行政方面，獨立自治政府設內務，敎育，財務，司法，國防，勞工，農商，土木，交通等八部及大總統直屬的會計檢査股和文官任用局。各部設部長，直屬機關設院長及局長。尙有副總統，亦依大總統法，由民衆選舉，在總統不在國時代行其職務，並兼敎育部長。地方行政則設六市市長，四十九州州長，市長由大總統任命，州長除特例外，都由州民公選。而首都馬尼拉市長，常爲最有腕力的政治家，有爲未來候選總統的希望。</p>
<p>（三）司法方面，設有大審院，控訴院，初審裁判所，治安裁判所及馬尼拉市裁判所，所有長官都經國民議會推薦而由大總統任命。</p>
<p>此外，尙有代表美國政府駐在菲島的菲律濱髙等辦事官署，其畏官由美總統任命，長駐馬尼拉。爲美菲兩國政府的連絡機關，實爲菲烏行政的最髙監督。</p>
<p>菲島財政，向由各部部長向財政部長提出各部預算，財長加以全面的檢齊後，編成政府預算，提出閣議。如得閣議通過，即由大總統簽署，提請國民議會通過。從前菲島財政，尙稱應付裕如，近年來因爲獨立問題，整備國防及調整經濟等，支出增加，至一九四〇年，已不得不實行增稅，以資挹注。</p>
<p>菲島財政制度，一向建立在完全目主的基礎上，政府一切費用，完全由全菲納稅人負担。第二次歐洲大戰以後，政府收支即見减少，試看一九四一年度政府預算，與一九四〇年度之比較如下：</p>
<p>特入的主要部份的租稅收人爲稅許及營業稅，輪入稅，消費，所得稅等。</p>
<p>菲島的金融大權，一向操在美人手中，一九〇三年三月二日新幣制，以二比索　一美元的比率，確立金匯兌制，貨幣及兌換劵的發行權屬於財政部，但菲律濱國立銀行，菲律濱羣島銀行有少額的發行權。一九四〇年三月通貨流通狀况如下：（單位一比索）</p>
<p>一比索銀幣　四、一九八、〇七三</p>
<p>二分之一比索銀幣　三、九七九、九六七</p>
<p>輔幣　一〇、四八七、八四二</p>
<p>白銅及銅幣　四、〇六五、七四一</p>
<p>國庫兌換劵　一五七、五七三、三七八</p>
<p>菲律濱羣島銀行券　一、七五一、三八五</p>
<p>菲律濱國立銀行券　三、四五九、八五三</p>
<p>一九四〇年三月二十一日計　一八五、五二三、二三九</p>
<p>一九三九年三月三十一日計　一八九、四二一、四六四</p>
<p>國庫兌換劵以銀幣一五、四五九、九一一比索對存美美金七一、二三八、八〇三·五〇元的百分率價凖備。</p>
<p>金融機關亦以銀行業爲中心，實力都在外國銀行，從一九三九年起，爲謀協助獨立，努力强化金融機關，設立農工銀行及準備市銀行，並設立農業信用合作機構。至大東亞戰前，本國銀行計有菲律濱國立銀行（總行設馬尼拉，爲中央銀行，資本一千萬比索），菲律濱羣島銀行（總行設馬尼拉，爲菲島歷史最久之銀行，西班牙時代的遺物，資本六百七十七萬比索），中興銀行（總行馬尼拉，華僑出資，資本一千萬比索）此外尙有菲律濱信託公司，儲蓄銀行，農工銀行，準備市銀行等。外國銀行有紐約國家銀行，香港上海銀行，喳打銀行，橫濱正金銀行，中國交通銀行等。特殊金融機關有農民信用合作社，郵政儲落銀行及卡「西奇」（一種髙利貸，年利從百分之二十五至二百五百不等。）</p>
<p>大東亞戰前的經濟情勢</p>
<p>菲律賓的經濟，全靠對外貿易，貿易環境一變，經濟就受打擊，而輸出貿易的百分之七，八十爲對美貿易，所以，只要美菲貿易正常，那麼菲島經濟就不會發生問題。例如前次大戰後，世界農業恐慌的巨浪猛襲之際，菲島輸出之大宗的砂糖，椰子乾，椰子油，馬尼拉麻，烟草等農產品生產，由於美菲自由貿易人爲的保護，使菲島得以避免恐慌安然渡過。不過，當第二次世界大戰爆發，及大東亞戰爭以前之時，菲律賓經濟遭到不易解救的危機。</p>
<p>歐洲戰爭，使菲律賓失去了歐洲的市塲，更由於世界對立的尖銳化，日美危機的激化。菲律賓的亞洲市塲，也瀕於喪失，即成爲菲島經濟生命錢的對美貿易，也因爲運費及保險費的激增而遭遇空前的困難。到了一九四一年七月，美國更因大西洋方面的迫切需要而徵用大批艦船，使這種困難更趨激化。更由於一九四一年五月二十八日之菲島輸出統制令及七月二十六日對中日資產凍結令，菲島不僅失去以日本爲始的東亞市塲，而且由於不能利用日本船舶而使貿易危機更加深刻化了。</p>
<p>菲律賓自己的船舶，本感不足，（遠洋船舶爲七萬七千噸），對外貿易，一切仰仗外國船舶。由於歐戰英國船舶先後離菲，資產凍結又使日船不能利用，船隻不足的情勢十分嚴重。試觀菲島貿易中各國配船狀况之變遷（百分比）。</p>

<h3 id="c66">設法根絕投機　—昨日大陸新報之評論— <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>二月十九日大陸新報之評論云：在過去二，三個月以來，物價稍回，但本月初旬　，重見奔騰在漲，使當局之抑平物價政策，不能收效。物價騰貴，爲民衆之最大痛苦，亦即經濟建設之一天障碍，是以平價問題，爲不　鬆弛之　前急務。回觀之過去之物價政策，實太寬縱，而爲消極之辦法，物價問題之重心，在於增加生產，不　僅用取締之方式，在中國之目前環境中，必須考慮一切特殊條件，同時增强生產，嚴格取締兼價行　。</p>
<p>使上海物價昂貴之最大原因，厥爲投　性　之囤積所造成，對於此類情形，如能施以有效辦法，則上海之物價目平。事變以還，民族資金失去正當出路後，專門從事於投機方面，如滙兌，標金，棉紗，棉布一路之投機買賣，但最近因取締投機雷厲風行，龐大資金，無法利用，致又造成囤積居奇之風，刺激物價上漲。再從另一方面觀察，投機交易雖經當局取締而减少，然尙未完全絕跡。標金之買空賣空，外幣之秘密交易仍在暗中活動，如再作更進一步之觀察，如囤貨居奇等類之目標，全在投機，如此種現象繼續存在，則抑平物價政策，將無法收效。</p>
<p>目下上海之存貨數量雖無法探悉，但估計有百分之七，八十被投機份子扒去，囤積不脫，此爲毫無疑問之事實。殘存於市上者不過百分之二，三十，但猶因游資過剩而被競相搜購。如市上之現貨减少，則囤戶之存貨價格自髙。市面之物資愈竭，囤貨之黑市愈昂，活躍於黑市塲之資本家遂能坐享厚利。吾人固先凝視此種事實，同時尙須考慮因投機囤貨而造成之一種社會心理。蓋囤貨之座右銘爲物稀則貴，如此方能利市百倍，故投機商之心理，希望生產低落，物資稀少，增發通貨，更不願國際情勢好轉。普通人所認爲悲觀者，彼等則認爲樂觀。國民所喜者，彼等引爲痛苦。彼等必須於內外情勢惡化之時，方能獲得巨利。此種思想，當爲普通人所料想不及者。目下中國之資本家，大半不作反省，整日祗知投機，囤積，居奇。吾人亟盼中日當局下一最大決心，取締投機，同時希望取締投機辦法，勿僅限於表面工作，更須切實施行，勒令停止一切以投機爲目標之經濟活動，特別爲取締投機性質之囤積。</p>
<p>經濟評言</p>
<h3 id="c67">游資移動與各地物價 <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>獻歲以來，物價上漲頗烈。據熟稔銀錢業　　者言：目前本市各銀行存款，已呈减退現象。　　爲商品投機重燃之反映；吾人未敢茍同。如係商品投機重燃，只　促進各銀行間存款移動，不會造成各銀行存款一般的下降。最近各銀行存款一般的减退，當係本市資金移出內地的結果。</p>
<p>去年七月以來，本市物價推移，大體上已由激漲狀態變爲漸進狀態。如七月份指數二九三〇分，八月份二九九六分，九月份三〇三五分，十月份三〇四二分。十一。二兩月份指數尙未見，依當時市塲情况而論，大致亦不脫徐進現象。但自本年一月以來，情形不變，而以糧價狂漲爲先導；次之爲證劵價格。在廢曆紅盤裏，這種漲風，才波及到一般商品界；而今尤烈。</p>
<p>拿上海物價此次上漲過程，跟內地比較，很有値得注意的地方。姑以南京的物價代表內地商品市塲吧，去年七月份爲二七五三分，八九兩月份呈銳降之狀；九月份是二三三七分。但十月份起，又呈反動。十月份激增爲二七二一分，十一月份更增爲三二四五分；十二月份以來指數未見。但以昨日本報所載一月份淸鄕區物價激漲之烈，可見內地物價上漲程度之烈，實較上海同時之物價爲大。</p>
<p>過去，上海物價常領導內地物價而上漲，從上面的情形來看，可以說現已變成內地物價在領導上海的物價，亦無不可。那末本市資金移出內地的性格，實有嚴格注意的必要。</p>
<p>游資積集滬上，人人爲之不安：因爲牠不事生產，而成投機的後備軍之故；各界乃熱望其移出外埠，投資內地。這種熱望，現在　說已部份的成爲事實，結果却出現了內地物價支配上海物價的局面，可見內地並未合理的吸收這筆游資，反而也在惡性的使用。由此可見處理游資問題，注意其運用較諸調整其地域，尤爲重要。</p>

<p>二月十九日大陸新報載稱：據中央儲備銀行三十一年度上半期之辦理滙款統計，自一月份起，逐有增加，此種現象，可證明物資溝通之進步，內地經濟力之復興，預料今後上海對內地之經濟聯繫，益將密切，聞滙款收付之總額約達十五萬萬元，總行分行之數兵比率，以上海爲最多，約占總額百分之八十五。</p>

<p>本市當局，近來爲取締投機，壓平物價，對各種買賣一經越出軌道，即予嚴厲處置。華股交易本不在禁止範圍以內，但因自舊曆新年以來，各股漲風再接再厲，故昨日華股市塲，依照當局意志，暫時停業，本市各股票公司，亦均隨之停止交易。復業之期尙未決定。</p>

<p>華北紗布供需狀况，尙乏可靠資料。但就全中國而言，則有政府之調査數字，其內容如次（紗以梱計，布以平方碼計）</p>
<p>棉紗供給量　二、〇二七、五　〇</p>
<p>國內產量　二、〇〇〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>國外輸入　二七、五〇〇</p>
<p>棉布供給量　一、〇四二百萬</p>
<p>國內產量　一、〇〇〇百萬</p>
<p>國外輸入　四二〇百萬</p>
<p>棉紗需要量　二、〇二七、五〇〇</p>
<p>國內消費　一、九七六、三〇〇</p>
<p>輸往外國　五、二〇〇</p>
<p>棉面需要量　一、四二〇百萬</p>
<p>國內消費　九二〇〇百萬</p>
<p>輸往國外　五〇〇百萬</p>
<p>就棉紗而言，上述之國內消費量三百萬梱中，十萬梱係用以製綫及其他，一百九十萬梱則用於織布，計量可織成土布二十三億平方碼，與上述之棉布國內消費量合計，爲三十三億平方碼。中國人口約爲四億，平均每人約需八平方碼。另加一部走私品，平均每人當在十平方碼左右（此數與政府對國聯之報吿數字九·五平方碼比，相差無幾）。華北人口約一億，按以上比率計之，每年富需棉布十億平方碼。</p>

<p>三、股東之表決權公司法爲限制大股束操縱公司起見，第一二九條規定：「公司各股東，每股有一表決權，一股東而有十一股以上者，應以章程限制其表決權……。」是一股東持有十一股以上之股份者，章程中應訂明其十一股以上股份之股權應打一折扣，即按幾折計算，其不滿一權者，可以不計。普通則打九折八折或五折爲最多。再每股東之表決權及其代理他股東行使之表決權，合計不得超過全體股東表決權五分之一，亦爲公司法第一二九條所規定。開創立會或股東會時，應隨時加以注意。</p>
<p>四、股東當選董事監察人之資格，一般創業人士訂立公司章程時，對於董事監察人被選之持有股份限制，往往規定太髙，其用意以爲資格提髙，當選不易，，則產生之董監，可以不致人選過濫，造成主張龐雜之現象。惟公司法施行法第二十一條規定：「凡以股數爲標準規定董事監察人被選資格時，在董事，其股銀不得超過資本總額千分之三，在監察人，不得超過千分之一。」法律旣有此限制，故公司章程規定董監被選之股份資格，不得超越上述之百分數。假定公司資本五十萬元，分爲五萬股，則最多規定一百五十股以上之股東有被選爲董事之資格，五十股以上之股東有被選爲監察人之資格，方爲合法；如超過此數，即爲違法矣。倘較規定之數額爲低，如董事被選資格少於千分之三，監察人小於千分之一，或竟規定所有股東均有被選爲董監之資格，法律上俱在所不禁也。</p>

<h3 id="c78">華中通貨工作底發展（二） <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>地位提髙底原因：</p>
<p>現在我們可能找出軍票地位這樣蒸蒸日上的各種原因來。</p>
<p>第一，不能不歸功於軍票回收工作底圓滑進行。現在華中軍票回收工作方面，有物資交換所和同業聯合會，但在華中和平區內分配的大部商品，多半都經同業聯合會手，而一段一段地轉入內地。這爲防止物資流入戰區，軍票就起着很大的作用。這種聯合會物品底結賬，在軍隊當局監視下，是專用軍票來進行的。大東亞戰爭開始後，軍票底保證準備物資，因爲由日本輸入困難，所以聯合會也已開始用鄕村當地村料充作保證準備物資了。旣如此，軍票地位底提髙，不能不歸功於華中聯合會底活躍。想使軍票有充分保證準備物資，則完善的分配機構就是軍票發展底唯一有力支柱。</p>
<p>第二，舊法幣底通貨膨脹，也曾盡了提髙軍票地位底效能。即使舊法幣現在仍然在中國人民間保持着信用，但由於濫發，而舊法幣背後的生產力，總不會永遠支持它的。從本質方面看，前年八月自頒佈資產凍結令後，舊法幣不能自由兌換外幣，大東亞戰爭開始後，舊法幣對外幣底調換可能性，已成爲有名無實的古董。過去一向用儲鈔軍票聯鈔等購得舊法幣後，才能買到歐美底商品，但現在倒不用如此客氣，而可以直接進攻舊法幣了：因爲業已成爲無用之長物，所以就不必再維持新舊法幣底等價，進而收回舊法幣以及禁止在主要地區內流通。在大東亞戰爭爆發前，舊法稱底發行額爲一百數十萬萬元，現在恐怕已超過二百萬萬元，這不僅走向惡性通貨脹膨，且在質上，即在其用途上，已走向沒落底命運，而軍票與儲鈔底活躍運用，却蒸蒸日上。</p>
<p>第三，客觀形勢也歡迎軍票增加。上述資產凍結令頒佈不久後，即爆發大東亞戰爭，因而收回上海租界，逐出歐美勢力，以致向來通過租界而輸入的歐美商品也絕跡於中國。然而日本商品正如上述，通過聯合會及物資交換所，只用軍票來往交易，如無軍票則不能得到日常用品。這就是一般人認爲最難侵入的地區農村，軍票也大步邁進，其理由是因日常用品須用軍票買到，而就不得不把自己底土產品掉換軍票</p>
<p>發展軍票工作底前途，目前仍不能樂觀。雖然車票巳如上述深入農村，但收買內地土產品，大部份仍然非用舊法幣不可。若想把中國底民族資本整個換上軍票外衣，這眞是夢囈，因爲軍票底發行額比起龐大的舊法幣來，眞是滄海中底一粟。（季譯自一月二十七日束京經濟學者崛新一原著）</p>

<p>— 柳坡</p>
<p>馬路上的乞丐，癟三，站在粥店或麵　前面，只希望能够吃一碗薄粥或陽春麵；可是他們沒有錢；吃不到：心裏覺得很痛苦。</p>
<p>住在擱樓或灶披裏的窮苦人，渾身是債。他們希望能够把債還淸；可是他們常常寅吃卯糧，沒有多餘錢還債；心裏覺得很痛苦。</p>
<p>住在前樓或統樓裏的人，薪水所入，勉强够開支，平平而過。他們希望稍微有些儲蓄，可是常不能如？，心裏覺得很痛苦。</p>
<p>住整幢　弄房子的人，有些積蓄。在事變前，只有幾千元：事變後，跟着大投機分子，做些囤貨·買賣烚赤·紗布·股票的勾當，　蓄的數字，變成幾萬幾十萬了。可是他們眼見一批白手大發「戰時財」的人，又羨又妬，心裏覺得不滿足，覺得很痛苦。</p>
<p>住大洋房的人，在事變前，財產已有幾十萬，幾百萬。事變將發生，他們已狡兎樣地把財產變成外匯，美票，烚赤了。事變延長，他們　機興風作浪，一會兒買棉紗，一會兒囤貨，一會兒買賣外股，一會兒買賣華股。他們忙碌，他們焦慮。他們內心很痛苦，不是爲的生活、而是爲的財產。有時候，他們對窮朋友嘆氣，說：「還是沒有錢的人舒服，有錢眞痛苦！」</p>
<p>總而言之，統而言之，沒有錢的人，生活不下去、爲生活而痛苦。錢少的人，爲希望錢多而痛苦。富人財主，患得患失，完全爲了財產而痛苦。</p>
<p>因生活不下去而痛苦的人，佔社會上的大多數；他們是最可憐的，他們的痛苦是必須解除的。至於那些爲了財產患得患失而痛苦的人，其痛苦是自討的，無足憐惜的。</p>
<p>假如有什麼妥善方法，使無法生活的人，可以勉强生活；使財產超過生活所必須的人，散出過剩的一部爲社會謀福利；叫人心因錢過少或過多所生的痛苦，都可减除不少。這是大慈大悲救苦救難功德無量的不世之業。</p>
<p>舉行什麽慈善跳舞，或演劇助賑，偶一爲之，未可厚非。如果再三再四，就令人啼笑皆非了。在目前，比較有　效的，似乎還是一面統制物價，取締種種變相投機；一面徵收所得稅，過分利得稅，造產稅吧。</p>

<p>據聞美國奧亥俄州當局，現止設法撲滅霍　　山谷附近煤礦中歷時五十餘年之火患，擬以滅火氣及化學方法，使其終止燃燒。按該　煤磺起火燃燒，已歷五十八年之久，　一八八四年時，有罷工之礦工數名，在奧亥俄州某礦蹤火、不意竟成燎原，　成巨　，　至目前止，焚去之煤斤，約二千八百萬噸之多，迄無撲滅之方。而附近居民，亦於無可奈何之中，聽其自然，迨火勢將燃至地面時，威以遷地爲良，以避其鋒。最近該地附近某校，即因地面熱不可當，而作喬遷之計，據地質學家調查，地下火燄距地面僅六碼，是以該地氣候特別溫暖，每値陰雨，常見熱氣彌漫，浸入住戶門窗之內，夜間亦遙見燐火之光，又因氣候溫暖，故植物極易生長，惟一朝火勢迫至地面？則地上種植立即枯萎。以往雖竭力灌救，惟迄未奏效，雖在四週築以水泥之牆壁，以阻火勢之蔓延，惟因火力太猛，泥牆傾圯，火燄仍越牆而過，直至最近，始改由科學家負責進行撲滅，預料以最新方法，當可以戢止地下火燄之蔓延。查歐洲亦有煤礦燃燒事件，足爲今日美國工程師之借鏡，例如一八六〇年，法國薩格蘇尼亦有煤礦焚燒，聞火之起源，尙遠在十六世紀，英國之「暖廳」，亦其一例。英人利用地而之熱力，種植熱帶植物，更利用熱力最大之地方煮水，惟不數年後，地下之火燄，改道他往，而「暖廳亦失其熱力，熱帶花草，隨即枯萎，而暖廳」亦失其名矣。（哈瓦斯世界電訊社十七日維希電）</p>
<h3 id="c91">關於「兩代女性」 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— 屈江</p>
<p>最近似乎有人在竭力排薦「兩代女性」。假使是普通的幾句捧塲話。老實說，一向少看電影的我，是不會去湊熱鬧的。但看到「文藝性濃厚」，「低級趣味的觀衆不容易接受」等字樣，我心里立刻湧起一種崇高的感情。一方面爲貧弱的中國電影界慶幸，一方面就很情願的買了一張大光明的入塲券。這倒不是故意要附席風雅，做一個髙級觀衆」，實在是翻滾在生活的煎熬中，我們需要藝術的陶冶，像需要空氣一樣的急迫呵！</p>
<p>我知道一般的中國電影是些什麼。我希望「兩代女性」能打破我的偏見，但是……</p>
<p>我願意把看後的感觸和印象寫在下面。請推薦該片的先生們不要以爲我是故意和他抬槓，並進一步予以指正則幸甚</p>
<p>（一）對話　我同意那位先生說：「中國影片中對白最多的只怕此片要算第一」但由此即推斷此片爲佳作，我是不能同意的。西施倘有麻子的話，難道凡有麻子者都是西施了麼？當然，文藝片是必得有對話的但有對話者不一定就是文藝片</p>
<p>口說無憑，但又沒有買特刊，只得就記憶所及，把對話中我所覺得欠通的，記幾個在下面：</p>
<p>蒙納（飾母親）自稱「我老人家」，雖然她在片中是一個威嚴無比的婆婆，但總不至語無倫次到這步田地吧。</p>
<p>也許所謂「文藝性濃厚」者，指的是這：</p>
<p>蒙納，我不是屬于這個時代的人。……一個神聖的事業在地面上消失了……那就是做母親的事業，……</p>
<p>假使不特別注明這是「兩代女性」中的台辭，諸位能相信這是年屆古稀一個燒香老太婆說的話麽？</p>
<p>（二）導演導演和劇本關係甚密切。劇本不好，導演無法使它好。但個別的塲面，導演還是應該負責的。</p>
<p>例如「兩代女性」中看照片的一塲戲，假使有好導演的話，我想大槪會很精彩的。記得美國片「人獸關頭」中有一塲戲和這很相像。一個野性的女孩，農塲小老闆的妻，（記得是菩蒂斐兒特飾），背人想赴情夫約會，公公管著她，不許她出去。這里沒有多餘的對話。我們但見菩蒂斐兒特臉部的特寫，屋子里每樣東西都靜悄悄的，只有時鐘的「滴答」打破這難堪的沉寂。……這是多麼有力的描寫。</p>
<p>（三）人物性格根據第一點，對話如此之不近人情，蒙納這個角色還談得到什麽「性格」？片中似以蒙納的戲最重。蒙納尙且如此，餘者更不値一顧。</p>
<p>（四）畫面「畫面」應該是導演對人物地位給予適當的處理，使整個構圖成爲一幅「畫面」之謂。這，在「兩代女性」中是找不到的。有人說：古色古香的佈置啦，曲折的走廊啦，美妙的自然風景啦，……我以爲並不就是電影中所謂的「畫面」。假使我們所求的是這些；爲什麽不爽爽快快去買一套西湖十景呢？</p>
<p>最後，我得招認：這張片子我並沒有看完它。只看到顧蘭君爬在梅熹身上，說：「爲什麼不讓我們睡在一房」？然後眼睛眯細，手搭在梅熹背上，脚踮起來，「吻我？吻我！……」的喊着，我就走了。說我衛追者也罷，這樣的「富有社會意義的「髙級文藝片」，我總覺得有些刺眼。</p>

<p>— 斯亦爲</p>
<p>（一）對於生活方面　敎　原是淸苦的事，在平時已是如此，這特殊的時代裏更不用說了。我所任敎的學校，比較的說，待遇還不算十分菲薄。可是物價的髙漲，渺無止境，所得僅僅顧到幾張口嘴。因此一切都得因陋就簡了。開源是無法的，翁敎爲學校所不許，抑亦爲事實所不能，所以祇得處處撙節，素菜淡飯，麵疙瘩，苞米羹，却覺別有滋味，電車本來坐的是三等，現在仍舊坐三等，亦無所謂其升降榮辱。家中一切工作，如能勝任，都自動手，電燈自來水壞了自修，器具什物壞了自補。非至毫無辦法，決不請人來做，衣服補補翻翻，只求整潔，不計時樣，現在我所用的一個書包，還是我的祖父傳下來的，邊緣已破碎得要漏出鉛筆來，早想賣給收舊貨的人，現在修了一修，早出晚歸，不特課卷書本置於此，有時連乾糧食物亦在其中，我又視爲珍物了。陸放翁詩云「貧窮原非學者羞」古今都是如此。</p>
<p>（二）對於涵養方面　我一生最感痛苦的，是我的健康問題，爲了身體的多病，不知吃盡了多少的虧！事變以還，生活日苦一日，如果一病再病，醫藥之費，將無所出！所以我決計與病魔相奮鬥。三年前我開始學習太極拳，我體會生理的作用與運動的原理，黎明即赴公園，除非雨雪，冬夏一日不敢間斷，三年來覺得身體進步不少，從前因爲多病，什麽却抱悲觀，什麽却感覺不滿，戰事却成爲我一個轉捩之點。現在我只求盡我的力，只求萬事問心無愧，只求能耐一家飢寒，富貴利綠均置度外，我不吃烟不喝酒，麻將更不進我的門，電影非特大家說好，難得一看，舞塲迄今未曾涉足，課卷倦後，或隨便翻木詩選看看，或就屋隅窗沿盆栽一點花草，星期日天晴，總與一家在公園散步，我愛好自然，下午參加禮拜或聽名人演講，使靈性上也得有所修養，愈忙苦，我覺得對自己的涵養愈重要。</p>
<p>（三）對於職務方面　對於我的職務，自持惟一誠字，一星期二十幾個鐘點已够力竭聲嘶空下來的時間，批閱考卷，來來往往，還得在車中費上一二個鐘頭，所以忙苦是不必說了！敎靑本來沒有標準不看卷也可給學生分數，誰也不會察覺！不預備也可踏上講臺，隨意扯上一二點鐘，學生也很少有敢責問的，可憐目下生活的重荷，迫得使多少敎育界的同仁們，一星期擔任四五十個鐘點，東奔西走疲於應付，不得不走這一條不該走的路，言之痛心，我雖也忙得够苦，但對這點工作，却始終不敢草草敷衍，對於不及格的幾個卷子，更得多看上一二遍，以期有所補救，並不使受寃枉，對待學生，在敎室裏，我素從嚴緊，在敎室外，我却主和藹，我喜歡他們課後隨便的談談。在實騐室裏，讓他們學習自動要他們注意準確：除非路上有意外阻碍，我始終不敢遲一二分鐘進敎室，我不喜歡拿着書本講授，處處我希望能說得生動一點，對於不能回答的問題，我就老實說不能回答，我勸他們不能完全信任先生，也不可完全信賴書本，都得帶點懷疑態度，去審愼思考，我很當心自己的言行，免得被他們作爲話柄，因而失却對我的信仰，我總覺得誠懇力行，是最好的方法，不特以之可動人，萬一或者有點錯悞，也易得他們的諒解</p>
<p>信筆寫來，已超過了數字的限制，所說的不過是我個人生活的一番檢點，至於應嘆的苦楚，則在目下上起大學敎授，下至幼穉園敎師，沒有幾個不是同病相憐，社會裏也沒有一個不知道敎書，是窮的勾常，在此不擬一一細說了！不過我總覺得在此窮苦生活裏，敎育自有其偉大的使命，對這一般莘莘學子，實在負着無窮的責任，我國社會上的黑晤腐敗，諸如賄賂，欺騙，貪吝，自私等等，大都是敎育不良的後果，我們只能站在自己的崗位上努力，盡目己的木份，我們只能看看學生好學上進的精神，作爲我們療飢止渴的食糧，當然我們極希望社會能設法安定我們的生活，我們也得格外發揮我們的師道。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Mobilizing People's Strength and Public Education <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The core of all wartime policies lies in the concentration of national strength, employing it in a planned and organized manner. Therefore, the mobilization of material and financial resources is valued by the government. From the wartime economic policy guidelines to all material controls and price restrictions, everything aims to utilize national strength more effectively to ensure the thorough implementation of national policies. However, we consistently believe that the most fundamental strength of a nation lies in its human resources, especially the awakened power of the majority of the people. All enlightened modern governments pay attention to the work of "awakening the masses," especially during wartime, when they particularly value the awakened power of the people.</p>
<p>Given the importance of "awakening the masses," this task is not easy and cannot be achieved by chance. To "awaken the masses," it is necessary to face the people, delve into their lives, genuinely understand their hardships, and solve their problems. Only through appropriate education and training can the masses be truly awakened and organized. Moreover, truly awakening and organizing the masses cannot be achieved by tying people's queues together like the Chongqing regime, preventing them from dispersing at will, nor can it be accomplished merely with a declaration or a few slogans. Consider how Japan was able to defeat Britain and the United States; this is certainly attributed to the military, but to whom should the military be credited? Isn't it the result of decades of military national education? Moreover, it is evident that Japan's victory over Britain and the United States is also reflected in the education, training, and organization of its general populace. Only by delving into the masses, enlightening their minds, can we truly awaken the people, mobilize their strength, and achieve a state of total war.</p>
<p>We must strive for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War, and we must go through an even more arduous and difficult struggle. The hardships we currently experience are far from over. Furthermore, this is an excellent test for our ancient China with its 5,000-year history. Therefore, we must now fully prepare, and the vast human resources must be thoroughly mobilized. Anyone who harbors a侥幸心理 (jiǎoxìng xīnlǐ, a mentality of侥幸 or "leaving things to chance") towards victory or a 苟免心理 (gǒumiǎn xīnlǐ, a mentality of "seeking temporary ease") towards hardship will only increase the difficulties ahead and encounter unexpected phenomena.</p>
<p>How can we cultivate a sound fighting consciousness among the people, how can we awaken and organize the masses to achieve the task of mobilizing people's strength and fulfilling national policies? The fundamental and targeted solution naturally starts with improving and promoting national education and public education: First, we must develop a national literacy movement to completely eliminate illiteracy. Illiterates account for more than 80% of the total population in our country. So many people do not even know their own national characters, let alone understand the state of the nation, society, and the world. Ignorant and uneducated people are an obstacle to policy implementation in peacetime, and they cannot exert the nation's strength in wartime. The government must clearly establish countermeasures, implement them within a limited time and space, and regard the eradication of illiteracy with the same importance as eradicating epidemics and bandits. Second, we must universally develop vocational and supplementary education. The former aims to provide all aspiring individuals, regardless of gender, with the basic knowledge and skills for various wartime production sectors, cultivating a large number of production soldiers in a short period. The latter aims to provide general occupational personnel or out-of-school adults and youths with the basic knowledge of citizens in the new era, enabling them to have a clear understanding of the state of the nation, society, and the world, and a correct understanding of their own positions and responsibilities. Third, political, military, police, public movement, economic, cultural, and educational departments should launch cadre training movements. All levels of staff in the above departments should participate in appropriate cadre training courses. After a certain period of training and qualification, they can secure their positions or be transferred to new positions that are suitable for them. In order not to interfere with their original work, a rotational training system can be adopted. At the same time, new personnel needed by various departments in the future should be recruited from cadre training courses. As for the content of the training, one is the business, knowledge, and skills of various departments; the second is international knowledge and wartime laws; and the third is service ethics.</p>
<p>The implementation of all mobilization plans and the practice of total participation in the war depend solely on human resources. Awakening the masses is the most urgent political task today, and promoting public education is a prerequisite for practicing this political task. We specially put forward this point, and we sincerely hope that all relevant parties will launch discussions and jointly formulate plans for implementation.</p>

People along the road cheered and saw them off until the Haiyan plane was far away before they returned in formation. In summary, although the Chairman's visit to Xuzhou lasted only a day, the enthusiastic atmosphere from all sides was unprecedented, demonstrating the deep influence of the Chairman's great personality. Administrative Commissioner Hao Peng expressed his gratitude for the Chairman's personal inspection of Xuzhou amidst his busy schedule and said that he would resolutely advance bravely, implement the central government's policies, and strive for local work to live up to the Chairman's expectations.</p>
<p>Xuzhou, 18th (Central News Agency) The Administrative Commissioner's Office of the Suhuai Special Zone has been established for a year. In this year, the political achievements in the Suhuai area have developed rapidly. Chairman Wang of the National Government, in order to inspect the local political and social conditions, took a special train from the capital at 1:00 PM on the 18th. Those accompanying him included Vice President Zhou of the Executive Yuan, Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department, Military Attaché Hao of the Military Commission, Vice Minister Zhou of the Foreign Affairs Department, Secretary Chen of the Executive Yuan, Dean Luo of the Central Hospital, Director Zhong of the Propaganda Department, and Lieutenant General Matsui, military adviser, and Rear Admiral Teraoka, naval adviser. The special train arrived in Xuzhou at 8:27 PM on the same day. Administrative Commissioner Hao of the Suhuai Administrative Commissioner's Office, Mayor Zhou of the Municipal Government, and other civil and military officials, as well as representatives from the Japanese side, all respectfully went to the station to meet them in advance. When the special train entered the station, music was played loudly. Although the Chairman had been traveling for a long time, he was still spirited and energetic. He stepped off the train to the sound of music, nodded to the welcoming personnel as a courtesy, and then changed to a specially prepared car and returned to his residence to rest. Along the way, civilians, soldiers, police, students, and Japanese residents held various lanterns, slogans, and cheered enthusiastically. The Chairman was very pleased to see the neatness of urban construction and the vitality of the people. The car arrived at the residence at 8:40 PM, and he listened to reports until about 1:00 AM before resting.</p>
<p>Attending the Anniversary Ceremony and Giving Instructions</p>
<p>Xuzhou, 19th (Central News Agency) At 10:00 AM today, the Chairman gave instructions at the anniversary ceremony of the establishment of the Suhuai Special Zone. The main points were as follows: (1) He highly praised the spirit of the people, security teams, and youth in the Suhuai Special Zone, as well as the achievements in reconstruction and construction. Twelve years ago, he had visited Xuzhou many times. At that time, the Executive Yuan worked on the train for a month. This time, although he only stayed in Xuzhou for one day, he could not say that he had fully engaged all five senses (body, heart, hand, eye, and mouth), but in just one day, the situation he had personally experienced and heard had greatly improved compared to twelve years ago. This improvement was achieved after the war, especially in the last two or three years. This was all the result of the concerted efforts of the officials and people in the special zone and the cooperation of friendly nations, which he was very grateful for. (2) He gave earnest instructions on the three points put forward at the beginning of this year: popularizing the spirit and training of the New Citizen Movement, ensuring public security, and increasing production. He stated that the organization and training of the youth corps and the promotion of the East Asia League Movement had made considerable progress. He expressed his gratification that the security of the Suhuai Special Zone was gradually established, the bandits were gradually disappearing, and there was no fear of food shortages. He pointed out that they should go further, strive to implement the National Spiritual Mobilization and total participation in the war, strive for the complete establishment of public security, and make the production of the Suhuai Special Zone more advanced, and make up for the insufficient. He also said that they should seek convenience in transportation and study the methods of linking needs to make the economy of the Suhuai Special Zone closely connected with the whole country. The chairman concluded this paragraph by saying that promoting the New Citizen Movement, ensuring public security, and increasing production were already very important. After the war, it became even more important. (3) In the past year, the foundation for the victory of the Greater East Asia War had been laid. This year would be the year to ensure the results of the war. He was very optimistic about the bright future of the Greater East Asia War. He then discussed the overall situation of the European war, pointing out the optimism of the future from the political, military, and economic aspects. The future of China, facing the bright future of the war, depended entirely on its own sincerity and efforts. He encouraged all staff and the public to make the greatest efforts to strengthen the country and develop the people's strength, and to cooperate with friendly nations with the greatest sincerity. (4) Regarding the unity of national politics, economy, and military affairs, he pointed out that the 21 districts under the Suhuai Special Zone were divided from Jiangsu and Anhui. Although the political regions had changed, the national politics, economy, and military affairs were unified. This unity did not change due to changes in political regions. As long as we understood this point and continued to work hard, we could contribute the most to the local area and the country while considering the local situation and enhancing national unity. Moreover, we would make the greatest contribution to East Asia with the overall strength of the country. In the afternoon, he spoke to people, students, and Japanese residents from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Meeting with Reporters and Giving a Speech</p>
<p>Xuzhou, 19th (Central News Agency) At 9:40 AM on the 19th, Chairman Wang of the National Government met with Chinese and foreign journalists at his residence and gave a speech, saying that he had been here twelve years ago. He had returned yesterday and saw that the general public was very energetic. When he inspected the security team today, he felt that their spirit was also very good, especially the young people who were particularly lively and lovely. As for the construction of streets and bridges, there had also been progress. He was very gratified by this situation. It had been five years since the Incident, Administrative Commissioner Hao had been in charge here for two years, and the Administrative Commissioner's Office of the Suhuai Special Zone had been established for a year. Looking back on the past and seeing the present, he could feel gratified. The Suhuai Special Zone has a total of 21 counties and 1 city. According to Administrative Commissioner Hao, there was no fear of food shortages. He was gratified for the people of Suhuai. At the beginning of this year, he had proposed three points: to popularize the spirit and training of the New Citizen Movement, to ensure public security, and to increase production. These three things must be achieved this year. Especially after the National Government joined the war, the whole country must work hard towards these three points. Xuzhou was the same. He hoped that all officials and the public in the Suhuai Special Zone would bravely advance and achieve the above three things, and cooperate with friendly nations to complete the Greater East Asia War in order to complete the mission of reviving China and defending East Asia.</p>

Important strongholds of the Chongqing army, such as Fenggu Village, Cheqiao Town, and Caodian, have been destroyed. The main force of the Chongqing army has been completely surrounded in the eastern area of Huai'an. A thorough sweep is underway, and a detachment is advancing north to destroy the main force of the New Fourth Army's Third Division in the western area of Funing.

<p>Japanese Army Announces One Week of War Situation</p>
<p>Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) The Press Department of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China announced on February 19th that the spring offensive operation launched by the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China since February 13th is expanding its war results for the purpose of annihilating the Chongqing army. Especially in Central China, a large-scale new operation has been launched in two aspects. One is the attack on the main force of the Lu-Su War Zone (80th Army) on the 13th. This is an annihilation battle against the Chongqing army that disrupted the rear of the Japanese army. It is being gradually reduced under the cooperation of the Japanese aircraft and thoroughly cleared. Powerful troops of the National Government army also enthusiastically assisted in this battle. In Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan, the Japanese army began to attack from Shashi and Nanchang on the 15th, and the mobile units on the river closely cooperated with the Japanese army and quickly launched new actions. A bloody battle is currently underway on the shore of Bailuhu Lake in Hubei Province. Also, the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China inspected the situation of the Japanese army on the front line in the Jinhua area this week. Therefore, the Chongqing side will feel more threatened by the development of the war situation in the future.</p>
<p>Overview of Operations of the Japanese Army in North China</p>
<p>Beijing, 19th (Central News Agency) After the National Government joined the war, the elite troops of China and Japan joined forces to severely suppress the remaining Chongqing Communist army, demonstrating the true spirit of cooperation between the two countries. The North China Japanese Army Headquarters announced an overview of the army's operations in January on the 18th. It is estimated that in early January, it went to suppress about 4,000 men of the 15th Security Brigade of the Chiang faction, who were active north of the Guangji Line in Shandong Province, and went to suppress about 2,500 men of the Li Xianshou Department of the 92nd Army of the Chiang faction, who attempted to cross the Yellow River from Henan Province and go north, inflicting heavy damage on them. Also, the Chiang faction army in Shanxi Province, which was planning to be active in the Hongdong County area, was dealt a major blow, and its counterattack attempts were completely crushed. Other elite troops, with the enthusiastic cooperation of Chinese military officers and civilians, launched attacks everywhere against the Communist army. In mid-January, they launched a painful suppression against the Nie Rongzhen Group Communist Army in various parts of the Taihang Mountains, completely destroying their last base. Also, in Shandong Province, they launched fierce attacks on the Shandong Column and the Jicha-Lu Border First Military Sub-District (east of Dexian), the Second Military Sub-District, and the Border Region Military Commander, who were active in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. Xu Shangwu, the commander of the Second Military Sub-District, had been killed. The army abandoned more than 2,000 bodies and fled. Also, various units composed of Japanese army security forces, county police, and anti-Communist commando teams in all parts of North China launched attacks on the Chongqing Communist army, which was planning to be active in January last year, and their attempts have all been in vain. Also, General Wu Huawen, commander of the newly compiled 4th Division of the Yu Xuezhong Department of the Chongqing-Lu-Su War Zone, and General Yu Huaian, commander of the newly compiled 1st Division, led their troops to join the peace camp, causing great confusion in the Chongqing army in the Lu-Su War Zone, and its anti-Japanese consciousness was greatly frustrated.</p>

<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 19th (Domei News Agency) According to a report from Washington, Ms. Chiang Soong Mei-ling delivered a speech at the US House of Representatives yesterday afternoon, with the main points as follows: "Our opponents are quite likely to be underestimated. The general opinion is to first focus on Adolf Hitler, believing that defeating Japan is a relatively secondary matter. Continuing to allow Japan to be not only a major potential threat, but also a future hidden danger, is not what the United States wants. We must not forget that Japan now has greater resources in its occupied territories than Germany. We must not forget that the longer Japan possesses these resources without hindrance, the stronger its country will become.

<p>Guangzhou, 19th (Central News Agency) – According to Chongqing dispatches, the recent military conference in New Delhi between former British Indian Army Commander Wavell and Chongqing Chief of General Staff He Yingqin resulted in the following decided counter-offensive strategy for Burma: (1) Initiate attacks with small-scale offensives; (2) Utilize air power to attack Japanese transportation lines and their bases, airfields, etc. It is also stated that the anti-Axis military headquarters deemed the climate unsuitable for military action, thus not attacking Burma, and also cited the presence of a 70-mile-wide dense forest area as unsuitable for large troop movements. Additionally, the repeated failures of British forces on the India-Burma border were attributed to the Japanese occupying advantageous terrain and defending with large forces, in an attempt to justify the situation.</p>

<h3 id="e13">German Air Force Active on Eastern Front, Fierce Fighting West of Kharkov, Part of Soviet Forces Withdrawing Elsewhere, Seemingly Preparing to Fight in the Dnieper Bend <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Fuhrer Headquarters, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – According to German commanders, German aircraft are very active in the eastern front regions of the Donets River basin, Kharkov, Orel, and Lake Ilmen. Following the thaw in western Caucasus and the lower Kuban River, there are only minor engagements. German forces continue to advance south of Novorossiysk. Soviet forces attacking in the Donets River basin and Kharkov region were repelled after fierce fighting. Soviet forces launched multiple attacks southeast of Orel, but were repelled and lost several tanks. German aircraft bombed enemy forces with great success. Soviet forces continued their fierce attacks southeast of Lake Ilmen, suffering heavy losses. Although Soviet forces were aided by tanks and aircraft, they were repelled in all attacks against German positions. Soviet attacks in the area between Lake Ladoga and Leningrad were also repelled, with many casualties. A Soviet unit was routed, and Spanish volunteers fought with great success. The city and port of Murmansk were bombed.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – Street fighting in cities often causes extremely heavy casualties for the defending forces. The Soviet army, based on traditional habits, enjoys being embroiled in such fighting, but the German army, in order to cherish manpower, actually disdains to do so. The motive for the retreat from Kharkov lies in this. Now the German forces that have retreated from that city can be transferred to a wider theater of war to engage in more mobile warfare. The military effect obtained will naturally be far greater than being trapped in the city. Fierce fighting is still ongoing in the area west of Kharkov. The enemy forces are advancing towards the Poltava area. Part of the enemy's forces in Kharkov seems to have withdrawn to other places, intending to fight in the Donets Basin and the Dnieper River bend. This is indeed the most important area in the southern part of the Eastern Front. German forces north of Taganrog Bay and in the western part of the Donets Basin are retreating according to a set plan. The situation in the Kuban region and the Taman Peninsula is also the same.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 19th (Central News Agency) – According to front-line news, on the 18th, German forces destroyed all military facilities in the city of Kharkov and then withdrew from the city. The German garrison annihilated the majority of the attacking Soviet vanguard units in the southern suburbs of the city, while still holding the Poltava railway stronghold. German forces also launched counter-offensives in the areas of Raojiangbo and Godogov, 40 kilometers northwest of the city, in order to contain the Soviet offensive against Poltava. In addition, Soviet forces in the Donets Basin are advancing towards Mariupol, attempting to cut off the German rear, and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with German forces. In the Starino border area, Soviet forces have made no progress. Furthermore, in the Donets Basin to the Kharkov area, the weather has suddenly changed drastically in recent days, with temperatures reaching around 10 degrees in the morning, so the area has turned into mud, greatly hindering the operations of both armies.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – Responsible sources stated last night that Soviet forces landing in the coastal strip near Novorossiysk continued to be repelled by German forces. The Soviet side attempted to reinforce with motorboats, but to no avail, and two motorboats were sunk.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Concentrating Forces, Attempting to Attack Poltava</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 19th (Havas News Agency) – In the past 24 hours, although fierce fighting has continued on the Eastern Front, no major events have occurred. The battle situation in each area is recorded as follows: (1) Kuban Region: According to Soviet war reports, the Red Army has made slight progress near the city of Krasnodar. However, the bridgehead on the Kuban River has been reduced according to the planned schedule, and the troops garrisoning the area have been transferred elsewhere to fight. The German army seems to be still adopting a "flexible defensive strategy." (2) From the city of Rostov to the city of Taganrog, the Red Army originally advanced along the Sea of Azov coast, but today the Soviet war reports did not mention any progress by the Red Army, apparently encountering strong German resistance, causing the Red Army to change its direction of advance to the north and occupy the town of Ergan. (3) The battle situation in the Donets River basin is chaotic. The Red Army has suffered heavy losses in manpower and material resources, but has still failed to make progress. Soviet radio also admitted that the Red Army encountered fierce German attacks near the city of Kramatorskaya and is still engaged in fierce fighting. (4) Donets - Dnepr District, according to military observers, the war situation in this area is dominated by the railway problem. The Red Army has concentrated all its forces, attempting to attack the city of Poltava from the city of Lozovaya, but has encountered strong resistance. The Red Army General Headquarters has concentrated troops in the area of Gravron, Pogoduhov, Yameyev, and Alekseevka, attaching great importance to the city of Poltava, which is regarded as a major center in military strategy. According to the history, when Russia and Sweden went to war in 1709, Peter the Great won a great victory in the vicinity of the city, defeating Sweden. If the Red Army wins in the city of Poltava, then the Soviet propaganda machine will take the opportunity to compare Stalin with Peter the Great. In short, the Red Army General Headquarters, regardless of the losses suffered by the Red Army, will continue to adopt an offensive, during which time the weather is really favorable to the Red Army, because the mild climate has caused the ground to partially melt, making the German motorized units useless, while the Soviet cavalry can move freely. In addition, the 23rd of this month is the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Red Army, so the Soviet Union has been publicizing it to all parties.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Goebbels Delivers Important Speech, Informing the German People of the Truth of the Situation <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – German Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered an important speech last night in the sports hall, informing the people of the truth of the situation and the German leaders' painstaking efforts, and encouraging the people to work together to strive for victory. Thousands of people responded with enthusiastic cheers, an unprecedented scene, rare since the National Socialist Party came to power on January 30, 1933. About 10,000 people attended, including the Japanese and Italian ambassadors, important officials, soldiers, wounded soldiers, and male and female workers from various factories. When Goebbels shouted slogans, the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. The full text of Goebbels' speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Lessons Awaken Europeans from Their Dreams</p>
<p>We should not trace the roots at this time and make unnecessary discussions. Today's merits and demerits should be left to future generations to judge. Time waits for no one. We must immediately take swift and thorough action. The Battle of Stalingrad is the greatest warning to the German people. The lessons of this winter war should have awakened the European people from their dreams. The rulers of Bolshevism, with their strict methods, conceal their country, so that at the beginning of the war, we failed to make an accurate estimate of their combat potential. Today, the vastness of their combat power is fully revealed, so we must now deal with them with the strength of the whole country. The threat of Bolshevism to Germany and Europe is no less serious than that to the East. Germany should pay attention to the following three points: (1) If the German army does not conquer the crisis, Germany and Europe will be ravaged by Bolshevism one after another. (2) But the German army and Germany are now fighting side by side with friendly countries, and they do have the strength to save Europe from this predicament. (3) Now that the crisis is imminent, we must recognize reality and deal with it effectively. If Germany is reddened, the intellectual class and the leadership class must first be purged, and the working class will be driven to become slaves of Bolshevik Jews, and all other countries in Europe will be poisoned one after another.</p>
<p>Unity is the Only Way to Resist the Crisis</p>
<p>No one can believe that Bolshevism can stop before our borders and no longer spread. The promises of the Kremlin and the guarantees of the British and Americans are all unreliable. We have all recognized the real crisis. The German people will never be willing to suffer this persecution, and they do not want to beg for mercy from others. If Germany, the strongest military power in the world, cannot conquer this red scourge, then what country in the world can bear this arduous task? The neutral countries in Europe at present have no power to resist even slightly. The Soviet mechanized units can ravage the countries in a few days. If Europe really falls into the hands of the Soviet Union, will Britain and the United States be able to stop it from crossing the strait? Therefore, Europe must no longer be divided, but must be united under the leadership of the new order and the Axis powers, and then it can use military power to resist the Soviet Union from invading Europe. Today, no one in Germany wants to compromise. The people of the whole country have made up their minds to fight hard, but they still hope that the whole of Europe will pay attention to this. Today's crisis is not only suffered by Germany, but the whole of Europe is suffering from it. Bolshevism uses international Jews to cause trouble in Europe. Germany has seen through its treachery, so it has risen up and is willing to fight against it, vowing to wipe it out and never give in halfway. This is the duty that National Socialism should fulfill. Now that the war has developed to its highest point, Germany will not waver its fighting spirit and will end this war with victory.</p>
<p>Lower Living Standards, Strengthen Strength</p>
<p>Goebbels said that the Allies were engaged in major military preparations before the war. The suffering suffered by the Soviet people for the past 25 years was caused by this. If you want to overcome the Bolshevik danger, there is only one way to use the Soviet method to strike the Soviet Union. The German nation has now encountered the most serious problem in this war, and must take great risks to protect all it has and obtain what it needs in the future. We will not hesitate to lower our living standards again to strengthen our defense forces. Now the period of total war has arrived. We underestimated the degree of danger, so we did not use all our strength to fight. Now we must go all out. The resources of our country and Europe under our control must be thoroughly developed. The German people are sacrificing their flesh and blood to protect Europe, and Europe should also exchange labor for it. Today, there are some Europeans who do not understand the purpose of our war. In the future, they will kneel before us and apologize not far away. The method we use should not be judged on its merits or demerits, but on whether it is successful. All Germans must contribute the most active assistance, regardless of poverty or wealth, they should all engage in the same work. In order to achieve the final victory, we must make greater efforts to fully contribute to the Fuhrer, so that he can launch another offensive in the spring and destroy Bolshevism in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Luxury Equipment Should Be Shut Down</p>
<p>The German people should only think of war, and should not think of anything else. Only in this way can the war be shortened. The largest and most active war is also the shortest war. In the event of total mobilization, all luxury equipment should be shut down. However, cinemas, concert halls, etc., which are necessary to regulate the workers' spirits, should continue to exist. The immediate priority is to make the soldiers on the front line concentrate on war, and the workers in the arms factories concentrate on production. The current measures are tight measures for the war period. The middle class will be most disadvantaged by this, but it can be restored after the war. In order to cope with the threat of Eastern Europe and Britain and the United States, this is the only way. If Britain and the United States dare to try to land, they will definitely be hit head-on. The German people are willing to be commanded by the Fuhrer, regardless of the danger. Japan, Italy, and friendly countries have repeatedly given blows to the enemy. We believe that the final victory is ours. When spring comes, the enemy will know how much our offensive power has been exerted.</p>
<p>The German Nation States Its Attitude</p>
<p>Finally, Goebbels asked various questions, such as whether you deeply believe that the final victory will be won, whether you are willing to follow the Fuhrer through fire and water, whether you are determined to continue preparing for war with all your strength in the front and rear, whether you are willing to obey if the Fuhrer requires you to work 14 to 16 hours a day, whether your faith in the Fuhrer is stronger than in the past, whether you agree to crack down on those who loaf and take shortcuts, and whether you agree with the principle of enjoying the same rights and fulfilling the same obligations regardless of poverty or wealth. Every time a question was asked, the audience responded with cheers. Goebbels said that the questions asked have all been answered by you. You are a part of the German people, and the attitude of the entire German nation can be seen from this. We can work without hindrance. We are willing to contribute to the Fuhrer and the soldiers on the front line with the strength of the whole country, and we deeply believe that the final victory must belong to us. The rise of the country must encounter storms. This is our motto.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Stalin's New National Policy: Preparing to Rename the "Red Army" as the "Russian Army": Intelligence Obtained by Berlin <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – According to intelligence obtained here, Stalin is preparing to change the name of the Red Army to the "Russian Army," and at the same time, he plans to adopt the usual European conventions for the status and titles of Soviet military officers. The purpose of this measure is to enhance the spirit of Soviet military officers. All of these belong to the new national policy held by Stalin. Stalin's policy was planned before the outbreak of the Eastern European war, and now he is using the war period to promote it vigorously, and even using the former Russian Emperor Peter the Great and the Russian generals Suvorov and Kutuzov in the Napoleonic era as examples for the people. These people were once regarded by the Soviet Union as representatives of capitalism, but now they have reversed their previous arguments. This is not surprising. The Soviet propagandist Ehrenburg recently published an article in "Pravda," changing the terms "Soviet people" and "Soviet Union," which he had always used, to "Russians" and "Russia." This matter is contrary to the principles of Bolshevism. If it had happened before 1933, it would have been regarded as treason, but today it is done publicly. The purpose of the Soviet propaganda machine is to make the people understand that this war is being fought for patriotism. In addition, the implementation of the titles of the Imperial Russian era for Soviet military officers, the establishment of the garrison army, the use of high-ranking military officer gold thread badges, and the order that political commissars in the army be appointed as formal military officers are all measures for the same purpose. Because Soviet farmers have little interest in the war, Stalin has to implement his new national cause quickly in order to boost the morale of the people.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Germany Prepares for Spring Offensive <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>(Asahi Shimbun's Moriyama Special Correspondent, Berlin, 11th) The German General Staff, anticipating that the Sixth Army trapped in Stalingrad has no hope of escaping danger, made the decision to withdraw the German forces from the Caucasus. During the withdrawal, the heroic resistance of the Sixth Army prevented the advance of the Soviet Caucasus forces, so about two-thirds of the German forces in the Caucasus were able to withdraw smoothly without suffering any damage. At that time, the German forces' operational goal was to build a solid defense line in the Rostov, Voroshilovgrad, and Kursk areas to block the Red Army, and they had no intention of occupying other places. Therefore, they were willing to abandon the winding sections of the Caucasus and the Don River area. The entire Soviet army had been struggling for the past two and a half months, reorganizing their offensive, but the result failed to meet their wishes. The Kursk position in the north first faced a crisis, and the key point of Rostov at the mouth of the Don River in the south was also under attack by the German army. The public believed that the German General Staff had made a major decision at that time, which can be seen in the German authorities' explanation on the 9th:</p>
<p>"The German army, for strategic reasons, has decided to abandon the Caucasus and Don River areas acquired last summer and is now beginning a planned transfer."</p>
<p>The starting point of last year's offensive, from Taganrog on the Sea of Azov northward, connecting the area of ​​Stalino and Kharkov, this time the German army will retreat back to last year's starting line, or will transfer its position to the west in order to obtain a foothold in the winter defense line. The current policy of the German army is to remain calm for the time being, waiting for the Red Army's ammunition to run out, and the soldiers to be tired and unable to advance, while the other side maintains the foothold for the third offensive this spring. The German vanguard generals and the rear citizens all endured their grief and lay on firewood to taste the bitterness, and the whole country was mobilized to rush to build a large number of new weapons in preparation for eliminating the Red Army's resistance forces this spring. In terms of weather in the battlefield, the thick snow will melt around mid-March, and mechanized units will be able to attack, which is still five weeks away.</p>
<p>At present, the weather is around zero degrees in the Caucasus, and the weather is coldest in the central area from Rostov to Lozovaya, with an average of minus 18.5 degrees to 23 degrees. Leningrad in the north is slightly warmer, around minus 7 degrees.</p>
<p>The area currently under fierce fighting from Rostov to Kursk is the most unfavorable battlefield for the German army in terms of weather and climate in the winter battlefield, and the soldiers are fighting bloodily in the ice and snow every day. Recently, there is a very interesting publication in the German side, which studies the German-Soviet war in the winter, recognizing that the climate of the winter battlefield is suitable for the German army to attack in the summer and suitable for the Soviet army to attack in the winter. The German army is well versed in this method, recognizing it as a famous saying that will never change. According to the operation last summer, the Soviet army adopted a retreat strategy to preserve its strength in preparation for the winter offensive. In the first offensive, the German army severely attacked the Soviet field army. Although the German army eliminated millions of Red Army soldiers, it did not prevent the enemy's resurgence of resistance. In the second offensive, it only occupied its vast territory and failed to destroy its combat power. Therefore, the German army has realized that when continuing to fight against the Soviet Union in the future, it should avoid strategies aimed at territory and must strive to annihilate the main force of the Soviet field army like the first offensive. It is expected that the target of the German army's third offensive this summer will also focus on this point. (Translator: Translated from Asahi Shimbun on February 13th)</p>

<h3 id="e24">Japan and the United States Have Different Objectives in the War; Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, Mr. Sato, Explains in the Japanese House of Representatives <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – Mr. Sato, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Army Ministry, pointed out today in the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives the differences in the war aims of Japan and the United States. The main points of his speech are recorded below: Although Britain and the United States initially claimed to uphold democracy, they have combined with communism, the enemy of democracy. Therefore, their so-called upholding of democracy and liberalism cannot inspire the war spirit of their people. Last April, Roosevelt also said that this war was a war for survival, but the American people were not moved by it. By July, Secretary of State Hull also said that this war can be called a war for survival, but the American people did not believe that the United States could not survive without fighting Japan. Therefore, the Undersecretary of State was extremely distressed by the incompleteness of the war objectives, and wanted to find a way to actively explain the war objectives of the United States. Broadly speaking, there is no significance to war. However, Japan's war objectives have been clearly stated in the declaration of war, which is natural in view of the course of the war, that is, to establish self-existence and self-defense, and then to ensure the stability of East Asia in order to contribute to world peace. This is our country's traditional national policy. The United States threatened our self-existence and self-defense militarily and economically. If we continued to endure, Japan would have no way to survive, and was forced to this desperate situation, and had to rise up for self-existence, self-defense and survival. We first established this self-existence and self-defense. However, if we only established Japan's self-existence and self-defense, it would still be insufficient. Japan's current position is to ensure the stability of East Asia and to move forward in the natural way of a war that implements national policy. This is to fight to implement national policy, to rise up to establish self-existence and self-defense. This is the posture of Japan in the war, and the great purpose of the war. Prime Minister Tojo also clearly stated the guiding principles of this war in his policy speeches at the 79th Diet and the current Diet. The entire guidance of our country's war is based on this great purpose. However, they started a war with Japan without any need. Judging from the course of events, it is all Roosevelt's ambition. Japan-U.S. negotiations entered the right track in April of Showa 16 (1941), but after our army advanced into southern Vietnam, Japan-U.S. negotiations completely stalled, and by the time funds were frozen, we entered a stage where we had to fight. However, thanks to Prime Minister Konoe's documents, Japan-U.S. negotiations were able to reopen. At the beginning of Japan-U.S. negotiations, the first issue was the China issue. If Roosevelt had properly considered the China issue and sought a solution based on justice, it could have been expected to pass smoothly. However, he had been completely fooled by Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda. Secondly, although Secretary of State Hull had always insisted on principles, he was unable to restrain the hawkish arguments of the young bureaucrats in his State Department and the hawkish arguments of some within the Navy. The politics of the United States is not dominated by affairs, but by the affairs that dominate, resulting in this great war. Looking back at the situation at the time, only Japan and the United States could have saved this world from being plunged into great chaos. From the point of view of Japanese diplomacy, our side believes that the Japan-U.S. war will gradually expand the current world war, and there is a risk that it will destroy all of human culture. Therefore, Japan and the United States should cooperate with each other to save the world from disaster. If the United States speaks from the justice and humanity it advocates, it should be able to save the world war. However, due to their various mistakes, they formed a reversal of direction. We would like to clarify this point to the whole world, that is, their war objectives are contradictory, and they launched a war without a reason for war, which is their biggest mistake. There is no need to embellish this, nor is there any need to exaggerate it, but it is appropriate to announce the facts to the whole world.</p>

<p>Berlin, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – Reliable sources here announced this morning that six British planes were shot down by German anti-aircraft guns during the large-scale British air raid on the German coast. Enemy planes dropped many bombs on residential areas, causing considerable damage to residents and destroying many houses.</p>
<p>Geneva, 18th (Havas) – According to news from London, British planes bombed the railway in Tours, France, and the power plant in Aubervilliers, Normandy, today. Belgium was also bombed.</p>

<p>Rome, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – The Italian General Headquarters announced in a war bulletin today that Gafsa and Sbeitla in central Tunisia have been occupied. The German and Italian air forces made outstanding contributions in this battle. The squadrons dropped bombs on enemy troops at low altitude and strafed them with machine guns. In this battle, 2,876 enemy prisoners, 169 tanks, 95 armored vehicles and a large number of spoils were captured, and six enemy planes were destroyed or captured. The offensive of the enemy forces in the north has been repulsed. Tripoli and Benghazi have been bombed by our forces.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – The heavy blow given by the German mobile units to the US Fifth Army in central Tunisia at the beginning of this week is becoming increasingly apparent. Our army has now advanced to the vicinity of the Algerian border, the area west of Nefta. After Sbeitla in the north fell into our hands, we completed the occupation of Feriana and Kasserine yesterday morning. The enemy troops are still retreating, moving towards Tebessa. Central Tunisia is completely under the control of the Axis forces. At the same time, the railway network in central Tunisia is entirely in the hands of the Axis forces. The convenience of transporting troops is self-evident for the Axis forces. However, it is inevitable that the enemy troops will take the opportunity to mobilize and regain the initiative. Therefore, the major battles in Tunisia in the coming days are just beginning.</p>
<p>Geneva, 18th (Havas) – According to news from the Axis countries and Britain and the United States, local battles are currently taking place in Tunisia. The British side claimed that General Montgomery launched an offensive on a broad front with his Eighth Army on the 17th of this month, but according to the latest communiqué, it admitted that the British army's advance had come to a halt.</p>
<p>US Secretary of War Admits Defeat</p>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – Washington dispatch: Secretary of War Stimson said at an intelligence meeting yesterday that the defeat of the US forces in central Tunisia was a local defeat and should not be ignored or overemphasized. Many of our tanks were destroyed in this battle, and the equipment and personnel losses were also considerable. However, this result was not entirely unexpected. As the British Eighth Army was reorganizing and the First Army was trapped in the mud, Rommel was able to concentrate his forces to attack the US positions. The strength of the German tank forces was stronger than ours, and it was expected that they would suffer a small setback in a large-scale invasion offensive. It is expected that when the British Eighth Army launches its offensive, the pressure on the German army can be reduced.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 19th (Haitong News Agency) – London dispatch: The "Daily Mail" admits that the war situation in Tunisia is critical, and that the Axis offensive in central Tunisia will threaten the position of the British First Army in the northern part of the country. Therefore, the British army has had to withdraw to the Algerian border. Military observers also said that the Allied forces, except for the British Eighth Army, may be forced to withdraw from Tunisia.</p>
<h3 id="e27">A Record of the Naval Battle off Rennell Island <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>(Sent from the Plateau Naval Reporting Unit, OO Base, 13th) The American main fleet, which attempted to counterattack the Solomon Islands, was ultimately no match for the Japanese Navy aircraft. The enemy's large fleet, composed of battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, suffered a devastating defeat off Rennell Island on January 29th and 30th, and scattered and fled. The glorious and traditional blitz of the Imperial Navy has added a new page of victory to the naval battles in Hawaii, the Malay Sea, the Coral Sea, the Solomon Sea, and the South Pacific. Two enemy battleships and three light cruisers were sunk to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. Victorious in the naval battle off Rennell Island were Japanese naval aircraft. The sea area where this naval battle took place was near where Japanese battleships were last defeated in the autumn. Now, the Naval Air Force has avenged the defeat with a victory. The twilight blitz implemented in this attack was the first since the start of the war. The daring Japanese naval aircraft overcame all difficulties and achieved success. This is a new record in the history of the Greater East Asia War. The detailed report of the naval battle is as follows, learned from the local air force unit:</p>
<p>Japanese reconnaissance planes had been conducting strict patrol flights in the South Pacific for days. On the morning of the 29th, they discovered the enemy's main force gathering and moving north in the sea area south of San Cristobal Island at the southern end of the Solomon Islands. They immediately issued the first report: "Enemy main force discovered!" The U.S. military had set up their favorite wheel-shaped formation, with destroyers deployed tightly to the front, back, left, and right as a close guard. Three battleships were advancing in front, followed by three Class A cruisers and several Class B cruisers. White trails remained on the sea as they advanced. The reconnaissance planes constantly sent telegraphic reports of their movements. The base received the reports and the atmosphere immediately tensed. The entire force concentrated its attention on the enemy fleet's movements, waiting for the order to attack. The enemy main force, not knowing whether it had been notified of our attention, continued to sail northwestward. The liaison planes eagerly took off towards the enemy's position. The base issued the command to bomb. The pilots' faces were filled with a desperate look. The weather was favorable and unobstructed. After a moment of preparation, the propellers began to roar, and with the squadron leader's words of "Good luck to you all," Lieutenant Commander N and Lieutenant Commander H each led a squadron and took off from the base one after another, intending to take advantage of the twilight to attack them unprepared and destroy them in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>The weather near OO Island was gloomy, with clouds covering the sky at a height of ○○ meters. The twilight sun was covering the sea, and the visibility was limited. The bomber squadrons descended below the cloud layer to search for the enemy, gazing at the sea like eagles eyeing their prey, and the formation moved forward towards the area where the enemy was expected to be found. The commander also reported to the liaison plane: "Attack scheduled to begin at ○○ hours ○○ minutes."</p>
<p>At that moment, as if by divine help, several trails could be identified on the gray-green sea. When Lieutenant Commander used binoculars to look at the distant horizon, he discovered black dots. He flapped his wings and moved forward, wanting to see clearly what he had found. The commander's plane also discovered the trails at the same time and immediately straightened the formation to follow the trails, gradually lowering altitude. Under the cover of night, the sparse trails became increasingly gray-white in color. At the end of the white trails, the dark shadows of ships floated. After each plane discovered the enemy fleet, they prepared for attack with excitement. The time was ○○ minutes after sunset. The sky was not yet completely dark, and there was still a hazy color remaining in the west. The bomber squadrons were protected by dark clouds behind them. This was still not considered an excellent opportunity to attack. The enemy was not yet aware that their own doom was imminent. The defensive fire was completely unprepared to "attack." Captain N's squadron seized this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to launch a sudden attack on the enemy's main fleet. The bombers advanced at a height of ○○ meters, passing over the enemy destroyers. The enemy had not yet retaliated at this point. The enemy's giant ships were the target of this squadron, and they flew forward at full speed, aiming at the bow of the enemy ship and launching a torpedo that was sure to hit. At this time, the enemy began to frantically open the gun doors of their anti-aircraft fire. The night was already deep, and the sea was scattered with blood-red sparks. Captain N's torpedo accurately hit the enemy ship's vital point. Before and after Captain N's squadron, several squadrons, including Lieutenant Commander N and Lieutenant T, also broke through towards the enemy fleet, targeting the enemy's giant ships. The defensive fire retaliated from the destroyers, cruisers, and battleships became a clear "beacon," piercing through the flames woven from the fire. A pitch-black battleship appeared before their eyes, like a small mountain. Torpedoes fell like hailstones. Several torpedoes were fired at the number two ship, which happened to be the enemy's flagship. Lieutenant Commander O's squadron selected the Class A cruiser protecting this number two ship as their target. The skilled torpedo accurately hit the Class A cruiser. In an instant, the bow of the ship rose and sank to the dark seabed. After each plane completed its mission, it retreated amidst the intense enemy defensive fire. The bridge of the enemy ship flew into the sky, and the remaining hulls and destroyers formed another incomplete fleet.</p>
<p>As the bomber squadrons crossed the enemy fleet and retreated, concentrated fire from the enemy ships poured down. Petty Officer 2nd Class M was hit in the head and shattered, dying heroically on board the plane. Lieutenant Commander N felt numbness and pain in his buttocks. A bullet pierced the telegraph machine, then pierced the seat and wounded the lieutenant commander's buttocks. When they escaped from the net of defensive fire and completed the retreat, night had already fallen. In the darkness, Lieutenant Commander H's squadron, following this squadron, arrived and used the flames of the enemy ships as their target, concentrating their torpedoes on the burning enemy number two ship. The commander's plane recklessly circled repeatedly in front of the enemy, throwing torpedoes, so that at the moment the torpedoes were dropped, the plane was hit by an enemy bullet and caught fire. Lieutenant Commander H's plane knew this early on, and heroically crashed and exploded at the same time as the plane. The enemy number two ship caught fire all over the ship after this fierce attack, and finally turned into seaweed at the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>In the darkness, they blindly flew back to the base. The lights emitted from the tail of the plane were spotted by the base, and they shot out searchlights to illuminate the airfield, and the squadrons were able to land one after another. The voice of the commander reporting to the squadron leader was low and dark, like the voice of a person who had been resurrected from the dead. The enemy bullet that wounded Lieutenant Commander N was discovered by the commander's plane. It was a slender steel bullet. In this attack, the Japanese side's sacrifices, including Lieutenant Commander H's plane, totaled ○○ planes. The next morning (30th), a reconnaissance plane that took off again discovered a wounded enemy ship and a towed cruiser. The air force unit waiting at OO base received the order to bomb, ordering them to capture an enemy battleship south of Guadalcanal Island, guarded by Klamath fighters, and moving south at a speed of 4.5 knots overnight. At ○○ hours ○○ minutes, the bomber squadrons began their attack. The wounded battleship tilted to the right and was completely covered in fire and sank. The cruiser also turned into a sea of fire, with its stern flooded and submerged in the sea. The Klamath fighters that were guarding them were also shot down three in air combat, establishing a glorious victory record in the South Sea. ○○ planes did not return that day. Combined with the previous day, a total of ten planes were sacrificed in this battle. (翔: Translated from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, February 14th)</p>

<h3 id="e28">The Shanghai Municipal Council Regularly Issues Oil and Sugar Certificates; Still Based on Winter House Tax Receipts; Metered Distribution of Oil and Sugar Not Confirmed; Total Sugar Stockpile Estimated at Approximately 200,000 Bags <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office announced that the Council has issued Notice No. 6265, which stipulates that the eighth batch of rice and flour purchase certificates and the first batch of additional grain certificates, the first batch of cooking oil certificates, and the first batch of food certificates will be distributed starting from Monday, the 22nd of this month. The distribution period and quantity of the three types of certificates for miscellaneous grains, cooking oil, and sugar will be announced separately according to the method of rice and flour certificates. The eighth batch of rice and flour certificates will still be in four coupons, and the first batch of miscellaneous grain and cooking oil certificates will be in two coupons, with two slips numbered first and second. As for the sugar certificates, there will be one slip numbered first. Taxpayers within the boundary can bring the house tax receipt with the date clearly marked on the back to the certificate issuing office in their residential area to collect the respective certificates. Recently, there have been frequent incidents of stealing house tax receipts to fraudulently obtain rice tickets. If the house tax receipts are lost, they should be reported immediately to the certificate issuing office or to Office No. 703 of the Council. In addition, rice and flour certificates are also often stolen. Hereafter, if they are stolen, they will not be reissued. Taxpayers or residents who have doubts about the certificate collection date should inquire at the certificate issuing office in person from 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM every day, except on Saturdays and Sundays. Furthermore, the office hours of the certificate issuing offices in each district are from 9:00 AM to noon and from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM every day, and the office is closed on Saturdays and Sundays.</p>
<p>Pilot Program for Metered Sugar Distribution in Nanshi</p>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Times," while the Sugar Merchants Cooperative is planning to pilot a metered sugar distribution program in Nanshi starting tomorrow (20th), business circles in Shanghai were widely rumored yesterday that a metered distribution system for sugar and oil will soon be implemented by the municipal authorities in the International Settlement, the French Concession, Western Shanghai, and Zhabei.</p>
<p>Suspension of Cooking Oil Sales; Black Market Prices Rise Sharply</p>
<p>The authorities did not confirm or deny this rumor yesterday, although they acknowledged that the current chaotic situation with sugar and oil could be eliminated if the municipal authorities implemented a metered distribution system. It is said that most residents of Shanghai are in dire need of cooking oil, as the suffering caused by the recent two-week supply shortage has been significant. Since the Lunar New Year, the suspension of cooking oil sales has caused black market prices to reach their peak. Although the Shanghai Cooking Oil Trade Association Wholesale Office issued several announcements regarding a metered distribution system at the beginning of this month, it ultimately did not materialize.</p>
<p>Sugar Rationing May Be Realized</p>
<p>Foreigners in the French Concession recently received their third allocation of sugar. Anyone with a bread certificate can purchase four pounds of sugar. As for residents of other municipal areas, they have not received another allocation since purchasing sugar with tax receipts at the end of January. Although sugar is not as important as cooking oil, it is said that the municipal authorities may indeed implement metered distribution soon. It is said that some time ago, the municipal authorities planned a sugar distribution method that would determine the allocation amount based on the degree of need.</p>
<p>Ample Sugar Supply Expected This Year</p>
<p>Since the Sugar Merchants Cooperative took charge of the overall distribution of sugar in Shanghai, the sugar reserves of Chinese merchants after the incident have gradually been depleted. In January, due to the Lunar New Year holiday, social demand for sugar was high, so the cooperative distributed 50,000 bags to cope with the situation. The supply quantity for this month is only about 20,000 bags. The remaining sugar stockpile is only 80,000 to 90,000 bags, which can only be maintained until May or June of this year, when there will be a shortage. In order to enrich the city's sugar reserves, the Sugar Merchants Cooperative has sought to purchase 100,000 bags from friendly countries, thus ensuring that there will be no shortage of sugar this year, with a total sugar stock of about 200,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Silver Trade Requests Easing of Price Limits - Authorities Have Not Yet Approved - Jewelry Trading Still Stalled - Silverware Guild Continues Petitioning <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the new year, the city's commodity prices have skyrocketed, increasingly impacting society and causing extreme public unease. Recognizing this, the Shanghai Municipal Council's (SMC) Commodities Control Department secretly dispatched personnel to investigate retail prices in various industries. They discovered that the four major silverware stores, Fang Jiuxia, Qiu Tianbao, Lao Fengxiang, and Xin Fengxiang, as well as major yarn shops such as Yuanchangyong, Jude, Dakangyong, Xiachenggong, Yili, Baohua, Xiongjuji, Qinfeng, Suitai, and Fengji, had violated regulations by exceeding the price limits set on January 23. Consequently, strict enforcement measures were taken, including sealing up premises and imposing fines, while requiring them to continue operating within the price limits, in the hope of thoroughly suppressing the price surge.</p>
<p>Silverware Guild Continues Petition</p>
<p>Following the strict penalties of closure imposed on the four major silverware stores by the authorities, the stores, through the Silverware Guild, dispatched representatives such as Feng Qing'an to petition the SMC. The outcome was a revised penalty of 408,200 yuan and permission to reopen. However, the price limit of 3,000 yuan was to be maintained. The silverware stores argued that the black market price of gold had already risen to over 38,000 yuan per ten taels, making it impossible to maintain the 3,000 yuan limit. To avoid incurring substantial losses, they have placed a halt on jewelry trading, their main business. According to reporter's sources, the Silverware Guild dispatched representatives, including Feng Qing'an, to petition the SMC's Commodities Control Department today, requesting an increase in the price limit to sustain their businesses, but no results have been achieved yet.</p>
<p>Authorities Giving Careful Consideration</p>
<p>Regarding the Silverware Guild's request to raise the price limit on jewelry, the matter is currently under careful consideration by the authorities in the SMC's Price Control Department. The ability to find an appropriate solution to this issue has a significant impact on the business prospects of dozens of large and small silverware stores in the city. Therefore, the Silverware Guild is hoping that the authorities can make a fair and reasonable decision in the near future.</p>
<p>Jewelry Trading Remains Stalled</p>
<p>According to a follow-up report from a reporter yesterday, although the large and small silverware stores within the two concessions have marked their jewelry prices at the SMC's price limit of 3,000 yuan, they are still adhering to their voluntary halt in jewelry trading. While some silverware stores are selling some gold jewelry to meet the urgent needs of customers, they are only selling pieces with extremely low gold content in order to maintain capital, and are only slightly increasing labor costs to compensate for the losses. This situation is difficult for customers to accept. However, given the potential loss of capital for the silverware stores, this situation is unlikely to improve until the request to raise the jewelry price limit is approved by the authorities.</p>
<p>Silverware Dealers Form Petition Group</p>
<p>According to reporter's interviews, a petition group was formed consisting of two representatives from the "Da Tong Hang" (major dealers), one representative from the "Xin Tong Hang" (new dealers), and one representative from the "Di San Tong Hang" (third dealers, i.e., smaller dealers). In recent days, in addition to repeatedly meeting with officials from the SMC's Guild Section, explaining the industry's plight in detail, and requesting a reasonable solution, they were also received by Mr. Inagaki, the head of the SMC's Commodities Control Department, on the afternoon of the 18th.</p>
<p>Mr. Inagaki Expresses Sympathy</p>
<p>It is reported that Mr. Inagaki expressed considerable understanding of the difficulties currently faced by the silverware industry, as related by the representatives. In addition to promising to give favorable consideration to the request to raise the jewelry price limit, he also expressed sympathy for the industry's recent voluntary halt in jewelry sales in order to maintain capital. Therefore, the Silverware Guild deeply appreciates Mr. Inagaki's ability to understand the merchants' difficulties.</p>
<p>Silver Industry Claims to Be Taking the Blame for Others</p>
<p>According to one representative, the silverware industry has been unfairly penalized by the authorities for moderately raising jewelry prices. Both the Gold Guild and the Silverware Guild truthfully report market prices to the SMC's Guild Section every day for verification. The prices of jewelry sold at the silverware stores are determined based on legitimate market transactions and cannot be monopolized or manipulated by the silverware industry itself. It is hoped that the authorities can make every effort to stabilize gold prices so that silverware stores will not have to take the blame for others in the future.</p>
<p>Increase in Price Limits Not Approved</p>
<p>A reporter made a special inquiry to the SMC authorities yesterday regarding the request by the silverware stores to ease the price limit of 3,000 yuan per tael of red gold. It is reported that the SMC's Price Investigation and Enforcement Committee held a regular meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday and will continue to strictly enforce the policy of severely punishing violations of price limits. It will not permit changes to price limits, and the price limits set for other industries will also be strictly enforced. Violations of price limits will continue to be dealt with decisively and without leniency. It is noted that fluctuations in red gold prices can easily amount to several thousand yuan, and if not strictly controlled, they will affect the price increases of all commodities, making it difficult to suppress them.</p>

<p>The fourth ration of rice for the month in West Shanghai has been distributed. The West Shanghai District Office has instructed over sixty rice shops in the three sub-districts within the district to begin distributing the rations yesterday. Each person is entitled to two "sheng" of whole rice at a price of five yuan in national currency. Residents within the district can obtain the rations from designated rice shops by presenting their fourth-period rice purchase certificates.

<h3 id="e32">Allocation of Goods Now Able to Be Transacted at Listed Prices - Coal Market Black Market Gradually Subsiding - Non-Rationed Coal Prices Still Hovering at Peaks <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Various coal trade associations in this city have now taken unified action to strictly supervise the sale of coal. According to sources, the coal merchants are now able to transact allocated goods at listed prices. Therefore, the illegal coal market seems to be gradually subsiding. However, non-rationed coal prices are still hovering at peak levels. It is reported that this is due to the demand from various factories. Coal merchants with stock are taking advantage of the increased demand for spot goods by hoarding them, causing public anxiety and slightly impacting market conditions. The continued occurrence of these events is extremely detrimental to the entire fuel problem in Shanghai. The authorities concerned are paying close attention and are determined to strictly prevent it. If it is found to be true after investigation, it will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Eighth Batch of Allocated Goods Still Uncertain</p>
<p>Regarding the eighth batch of coal allocation, totaling 4,500 tons, handled by the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company, although the amount has been fixed, the implementation has been delayed due to delays. As of yesterday, there is still no definite date. Yesterday, sources in the coal industry revealed that the price per ton has not yet been determined. However, as merchants are in dire need of goods, they are hoping for an early resolution, otherwise, it will affect the operations of the various coal companies. It is reported that the eighth batch of coal allocation has no confirmed date and must await an announcement from the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company.</p>
<p>Cooked Water Coal Awaits Fair Sale</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cooked Water Shop Guild, in response to the request of all its members, has resumed the sale of cooked water at parity prices. It has appealed to the SMC's Guild Section, expressing the plight of its members and suggesting that the ashes from the Yangshupu Water and Electricity Plant be authorized for distribution by the guild to avoid profiteering by contractors. Since the dispatch of the document, no response has been received, so the guild is very anxious, hoping for an early sale of cooked water at parity prices to reduce costs, otherwise, they will be forced to close down.</p>

<p>A Shanghai dispatch from the Tong Meng News Agency reports that Mr. Matsuda, the Japanese Army Deputy Spokesman, announced at yesterday's press conference that the Japanese army has transferred troops from Guadalcanal Island to other locations in order to consolidate its positions in the South Pacific. The enemy was unaware of the transfer until it was completed and the Tokyo government issued a communique. In the future, Japan will launch a major air raid on the island. The announcement by the General Headquarters on Wednesday was the beginning. The American troops are isolated there, lacking food, weapons, and supplies, and are in a living hell.</p>

<p>A Shanghai dispatch from the Tong Meng News Agency reports that Mr. Hirota, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, pointed out at yesterday's press conference that the report in the "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" on February 17, claiming that he predicted that Stalingrad would soon be captured by the Germans, was a misrepresentation. He stated that he has never predicted the fall of Stalingrad in past speeches. On February 16, a reporter asked Mr. Hirota if he still held the same opinion regarding Stalingrad, which led to the misunderstanding. Yesterday, he solemnly stated to foreign reporters that what he specifically mentioned on August 4 was, "If Stalingrad falls, it would be a blow to the Soviet Union." On the 16th, in response to the reporter's question, he only said that he was not a prophet and could not say whether Stalingrad would fall.</p>

<p>In order to comply with the authorities' material rationing policy and to facilitate business among members of the same industry, various industry associations in this city have established "Rationing Groups," which have been approved by the relevant senior authorities. Rationed items are temporarily limited to daily necessities for the people. Rationing to various industries is also limited to items directly related to the industry and must not exceed the scope. It is reported that the associations that have already established "Rationing Groups" include the local cotton cloth, leather, and leather shoe industries. These "Rationing Groups" are similar to unlimited liability companies. Once formally established, the following steps will be implemented: (1) Control of the source of goods to ensure a constant supply of finished products and raw materials without interruption; (2) Registration of inventory to prevent hoarding and refusal to sell; (3) Regular and fair allocation of appropriate quantities of goods to shops participating in the rationing group; (4) Negotiation with the authorities to facilitate the transportation of goods and jointly expand out-of-town business; (5) Establishment of a price evaluation committee to assess prices in accordance with the authorities' established policies and instruct members of the same industry to comply, with penalties of suspension of rationing for those who violate the rules.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Scholarship Funds Barely Adequate - Reduce Introduction of Free Students - Supplement Remaining Funds for Needy Students in Various Schools <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The 4th Shanghai Newspaper Readers' Scholarship Fund has previously received letters from various schools donating free and half-fee places to support young people. Apart from introducing students for enrollment based on applications, this newspaper, thanks to the generous donations from various sectors, has found that the scholarship fund is barely adequate. Therefore, enrollment checks have been issued and efforts have been made to reduce the introduction of free places. Considering the sincere enthusiasm of various schools in supporting education, it is proposed that schools be allowed to grant free or reduced fees to needy students from their own student body to make up for the shortfall in this newspaper's scholarship fund. Schools are better informed about the true circumstances of students than this newspaper. This is the reflection that this newspaper wishes to contribute after the various schools have generously donated free places.</p>
<p>Extending Consideration to Others - Scholarship for Tuition</p>
<p>This newspaper received a letter from Wang Zuquan, a second-year student at Fu Ren Middle School, stating that he received a special scholarship from the school authorities this semester, exempting him from tuition for one semester. Feeling uneasy about this, he will donate the tuition fee of 300 yuan (150 yuan each from your newspaper and the News Daily) to your newspaper's needy student scholarship fund to express his gratitude. He hopes to receive your guidance and acceptance.</p>
<p>A major bank wrote, stating that they have 280 notebooks. Currently, paper prices are very high, and it is not easy for poor students to buy notebooks. They are sending the remaining notebooks and respectfully request your newspaper to collect and distribute them. (This newspaper will comply and distribute them by name when visiting the students.)</p>

<p>Mr. Hayashi Fusao, a master of Japanese literature, recently arrived in Shanghai from Beijing. To express welcome and promote cultural exchange between China and Japan, Chen Dongbai and others jointly organized a tea party reception at the Jinmen Hotel on the 8th floor yesterday, the 19th, at 3:00 PM. Prominent figures from the city's news and culture sectors were invited to accompany, totaling more than 30 people, including Wang Ping.

<p>Although the deadline for exchanging standard water ladles for cooked water shops in the city was the 15th of this month, it was learned yesterday that the association, considering that the owners of various cooked water shops have limited knowledge and are not familiar with the procedures, has decided to extend the deadline to the end of this month to take care of the welfare of the industry. However, exchanges must be carried out promptly during this period, and no leniency will be shown if they continue to wait. Not only will the exchange date not be extended further, but the matter will be reported to the authorities for punishment in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Measures to Improve Traffic Order at the North Railway Station <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Record of Discussion</p>
<p>After the traffic authorities announced the measures to improve the order of entry at the North Railway Station yesterday, this newspaper expressed its gratitude on behalf of the travelers. At the same time, we hope that the authorities will continue to seek improvements to achieve the most ideal situation. We also hope that travelers will continue to report on travel conditions after the improvements and provide practical suggestions for the authorities to consider.</p>
<p>However, on the 16th of this month, this newspaper felt that relying solely on readers' reports was insufficient to substantiate the facts. Realizing the necessity of on-site inspection, letters were sent inviting Chinese and Japanese individuals concerned about social issues to set off for the North Railway Station for inspection yesterday afternoon. Coincidentally, the authorities announced the improvement measures the day before. The colleagues felt that the purpose and mission of the previous plan for on-site inspection had been largely achieved, so it was temporarily suspended and changed to a discussion meeting. Mr. Yoshida (Anti-British and American Association), Mr. Hirao (Asahi Shimbun), Mr. Itagaki (New Shanghai Newspaper), Mr. Oba (Yomiuri Shimbun) from the friendly Japanese side, as well as Mr. Zhang Yizhu, Mr. Li Quanshi, and Mr. Lu Gaoyi, personally participated, along with three reporters from this newspaper, to exchange views and draw conclusions, which are as follows:</p>
<p>Expectations of the Traffic Authorities</p>
<p>(1) More entrances and exits should be set up at the station and should be separated.</p>
<p>(2) More police officers should be assigned to the baggage inspection area. The inspection area should be located outside the station building and set up with low counters with awnings. Objects being inspected should not be placed on the ground. Care for passengers' luggage should be treated with the same care as one's own luggage.</p>
<p>(3) As many ticket windows as possible should be set up. In addition to the regular opening and closing times for most windows, two more should be designated to sell first and second-class and third and fourth-class tickets separately, with ticket sales available at any time from dawn to late night.</p>
<p>(4) Outside each ticket window, the number and name of the ticket seller on duty should be marked on a small wooden sign with white lettering on a black background.</p>
<p>(5) Passengers and checked baggage should enter the platform separately.</p>
<p>(6) Ticket offices should be set up in suitable locations in the city, or travel agencies and major hotels should be entrusted to handle ticket sales.</p>
<p>(7) A passenger opinion report box should be set up.</p>
<p>(8) Tea parties should be held from time to time, inviting representatives from all walks of life to provide improvement suggestions.</p>
<p>(9) A railway travel guide should be edited and distributed widely, and disclosed in the newspaper to inform travelers of the travel outline.</p>
<p>(10) Senior officials may as well often wear casual clothes and mingle with travelers to experience everything.</p>
<p>(11) Railway staff should treat passengers as customers and treat them with courtesy. Even if beggars buy fourth-class tickets, they should be treated with the same courtesy. If passengers are unclear about the order, they should be given guidance.</p>
<p>(12) Couriers are strictly prohibited from soliciting extra tips (such as guide fees and tips other than the stipulated handling fees).</p>
<p>Expectations of the General Public of Passengers</p>
<p>(1) Do not rush in and out of entrances and exits, and push each other; and let the elderly, weak, women, and children go first.</p>
<p>(2) Carry as little luggage as possible to save inspection time.</p>
<p>(3) Do not use the body to carry and sell objects (for example, on one occasion, a group of women from Changzhou, whose abdomens were bulging, all claimed to be pregnant, but in fact, they were all hiding several pounds of pork to sell for profit, which inevitably affects genuine passengers).</p>
<p>(4) Abide by all regulations promulgated by the railway and follow the good-intentioned guidance of railway staff.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Banks and Financial Institutions Assist in Suppressing and Stabilizing Prices - Undertake Loans for Production Businesses - Stipulate Mortgage and Credit Loan Methods - Strictly Review to Avoid Promoting Speculation <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>In order to prevent the use of loan funds to promote hoarding and speculation, and to assist the authorities in suppressing and stabilizing prices, banks and financial institutions have decided to limit all loans to production businesses. Applicants must explain the legitimate purpose and must be approved after strict review before loans are granted. According to sources in the banking and financial industries, the regulations for mortgage and credit loans are: (A) Mortgage loans with commodities as collateral are limited to factories, shops, and firms that are members of the relevant industry association, and the term shall not exceed three months. The bank or financial institution accepting the mortgage shall report to the association and forward it to the authorities for record. (1) The name of the borrower's factory, shop, or firm and the names of other representatives; (2) the amount and term of the loan; (3) the name and quantity of the collateral; (4) the location where the collateral is stored; (5) the registration certificate number of the borrower's factory, shop, or firm and the certificate of the affiliated industry association; (B) For overdrafts and credit loans, each bank or financial institution shall stipulate the total amount of the overdraft and must have a reliable guarantor guarantee that it will be completely cleared before the end of the annual closing period. Interest rates are calculated according to the deposit and loan interest rate market published by the association at the end of each month. The term for credit loans is six months, with the annual due dates being the end of April and the end of October. Short-term loans, i.e., those less than six months, are approved by the lending bank or financial institution based on the credit of each industry and the silver supply on the market. The standards for loans are to increase production in various industries, such as purchasing agricultural products and ordering necessary raw materials.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Committee for Reorganizing Old Currency - Handles Termination <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The Committee for Reorganizing Old Currency was ordered to handle the recovery of old currency issued by the Central, China, and Communications Banks. It was established on June 8th of last year and branch offices were set up within the branch offices of the Central Reserve Bank in various places. Old currency was redeemed at a rate of two to one with new legal tender. It has been more than eight months since then. The committee has now completed the final exchange of old currency in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces and Shanghai and Nanjing special municipalities at the end of November last year. The final exchange in the Guangzhou area was completed on January 25th of this year. The final exchange in Wuhan was also completed on the 15th of this month. The work of reorganizing and redeeming old currency has now been completed, and old currency has been banned from circulation. Therefore, it has been ordered to begin the termination procedures and to send a telegram to branch offices in various places to complete the termination procedures within this month and report to the Ministry of Finance for verification.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Noodle Product Industry - Flour Not Yet Distributed - Bread Flour Rationing as Usual - Consideration Being Given to Cut Noodles, etc. <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The matter of the noodle product industry in this city requesting the SMC to resume flour rationing has not yet been satisfactorily resolved. It is learned that the SMC's Commodities Control Department has continued to ration flour to bread manufacturers as usual, but has not yet resumed rationing for various products such as cut noodles, cooked noodles, "wa pian bing" (thin, crispy pancakes), steamed buns, large flatbreads, crispy flatbreads, and fried dough sticks, which are regarded by the public as economical and convenient food. Although the rice flour rationing office has adopted a joint rationing method for raw cut noodles and cooked noodles, the quantity is limited and insufficient for the industry to distribute. Therefore, they are still petitioning for improved measures. The cake and bun industry association believes that the association has a long history and that the term "cake and bun" includes various economical flour-based foods, such as "wa pian bing," which are economical, filling, and the main food for the poor. Therefore, four representatives, including Zhang Guanshou, Zai Guisheng, Zhang Jinsheng, and Tang Miaoquan, were dispatched to petition the Guild Section and the Commodities Control Department for early allocation of flour for production and sales. It is now learned that it is under consideration.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Assisting the Authorities in Curbing Price Hikes: Various Industries Expand Price Appraisal Organizations; Agreed-Upon Price Limits for Managed Goods; No Leniency Granted to Those Already Making a Legal Profit <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the city's overall price issue, since the municipal authorities have successively taken effective measures to strictly curb the rising prices of goods, the situation has gradually changed. Currently, the authorities have decided to jointly continue to severely punish illegal merchants.</p>
<p>Separate Organizations of Price Appraisal Committees</p>
<p>Various trade associations in the city, in order to assist the authorities in thoroughly suppressing prices and to standardize the business environment, have been responsible for appraising the standard price limits for goods managed by their respective member businesses. However, their procedures are very meticulous. First, all member businesses are notified to submit the type, price, origin, and amount of inventory of the goods to the association. Then, a price appraisal committee is convened to publicly discuss and agree on standard price limits. After the appraisal is completed, the association prepares a document with a table attached and forwards it to the relevant authorities for review. After their approval, the association officially prints a price list and distributes it to all member businesses for compliance. Those who violate the regulations and secretly sell goods above the price limit will be subject to public discussion and punishment, either by revoking their membership or by suspending their various rights for a considerable period.</p>
<p>Inviting Experts to Participate in Price Appraisal</p>
<p>Currently, those in charge of the various associations, recognizing that if price increases are not stopped in time, it will not only affect social order but also increase the daily burden on the common people, consider curbing rising prices as a top priority. However, in order to deliberate on effective measures and speed up progress, they have separately strengthened the organizational structure of the price appraisal committees. On the one hand, they have sent letters to specialized talents in the industry, asking them to attend meetings on time to participate in the appraisal and carefully study concrete and effective methods to expand the appraisal work. However, all industries, considering that the price limits set in the past have already provided legal profits, have decided not to grant leniency in the future in order to achieve the purpose of the appraisal. If costs increase, they must apply to the association and must not increase prices without authorization.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Shanghai Old Age Home Broadcasts Fundraising Appeal, Hoping for Enthusiastic Response from Citizens <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Havas World News Agency, local news. The Shanghai Old Age Home, located at No. 29, Jichang Street, Nanshi, has been established for 38 years. It specializes in accepting helpless elderly men and women. Anyone close to 60 years old can be admitted to live out their lives. The annual expenses of the home have always been provided by foreign charitable organizations. However, after the war, the number of admitted people has surged, the cost of living has increased, and the supply of provisions has been interrupted. As a last resort, the nuns of the home have been begging all day long to maintain a minimal existence. Recently, the home received the consent of the director of the French Cultural Radio Station in the city to broadcast a fundraising appeal. They have also been fortunate to have the China Boy Scout Corps of Aurora University in the city volunteer to manage the collection of donations. It has started broadcasting every evening from 6:00 PM to 6:50 PM since the 15th of this month. Many enthusiastic charitable people from all walks of life have responded, and a large number of donations have been received. In the past four days, the total amount raised has exceeded ten thousand yuan, so the station staff and all the boy scouts are overwhelmed. However, in order to raise more funds and expand publicity, special programs will be broadcast on Saturday and Sunday, from 2:00 PM every day. On Saturday, a charity performance of Peking Opera will be given by famous opera singers, and on Sunday, a singing contest will be held. It is reported that the singer Yao Li is also enthusiastically joining as a guest performer. All are welcome to request songs and donate. Frequency: 1400. Telephone: 80567.</p>

<p>Since the Municipal Grain Administration was ordered to handle the registration of rice merchants, rice businesses and shops in the city and the two settlements have enthusiastically applied for registration. As a result, the original deadline of the 15th of this month could not be met. The administration has specially extended the deadline by 20 days to March 7th. At that time, there will be no further extensions. As this matter concerns the rights and interests of the industry itself, it is hoped that unregistered rice businesses and shops will not wait and see, lest they bring trouble upon themselves.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Organizing a Cooperative for Education Workers <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Daofu</p>
<p>Another semester has come to an end. Looking ahead, the hardship will be even greater than today. How can we, education comrades struggling on the line of hunger, do our best to improve the situation, so as to avoid freezing and starvation, and to devote our efforts to our work? Increasing tuition fees and raising salaries are undoubtedly important. However, the increase in tuition fees may seem sufficient at the beginning of the semester, but after a few months, it will not seem like much.</p>
<p>What we are currently facing the most difficulty with is the scarcity of daily necessities. The amount of rice and flour per household is far from enough, and the same goes for oil and sugar. Even other daily necessities such as soap, towels, and socks are beyond our reach. It is therefore imperative to have special allocations. Currently, in Shanghai, those working for agencies in the two settlements and the city have extra allocations, which is why they can work with peace of mind, and their efficiency can be improved. Even in Songjiang, Suzhou, and other rural areas, there are cooperative organizations, and all members can enjoy similar extra allocations. Since its implementation, the results have been remarkable. Therefore, it is necessary and possible for education workers in Shanghai to organize their own cooperative and request special extra allocations from the authorities. The enlightened authorities will certainly consider this and provide strong support to make this welfare undertaking a success.</p>
<p>Among the special extra allocations, rice and flour should be the top priority, followed by daily necessities such as oil, sugar, and soap. In this way, in addition to increasing the quantity, the price can also be free from the manipulation of the black market, which will greatly benefit education workers. The impact will not only stabilize the lives of education workers and invisibly improve the effectiveness of education, but also gradually stabilize the instability of society. However, this matter is of great importance and cannot be accomplished by the efforts of one department of education workers alone. It requires the combined efforts of several forces to achieve success soon. The Shanghai Education Association and the education guidance agencies in the two settlements and the city should all provide leadership, and we education workers ourselves should make even greater efforts to save ourselves, which is to save society.</p>

<p>Hiring Workers to Repair Dilapidated Roads</p>
<p>According to reporter inquiries, some roads in the Public Settlement and the French Settlement have shown signs of cracking and unevenness due to years of disrepair. Therefore, investigators dispatched by the authorities have surveyed the sections of streets that need to be repaired, reported them to the authorities, and the authorities have hired workers to repair them in order to maintain traffic.</p>
<p>Adding as Many Tram Platforms as Possible</p>
<p>At the same time, in order to ensure the safety of tram passengers waiting for vehicles, the authorities will add waiting platforms next to the main stations starting tomorrow to avoid dangers caused by excessive crowding. According to reporter inquiries, these added platforms are currently being built by the authorities. Within the realm of possibility, they will be added as much as possible at the necessary locations.</p>
<p>Hoping Residents Will Not Litter</p>
<p>As for street garbage, fruit peels, and other scattered litter, they often cause people to slip and cause accidents.

<p>In order to effectively maintain public health in the city and ensure the health of the people, the Municipal Police Bureau has issued a notice banning unhygienic habits, stating that the public in the city has not fully understood the common sense of hygiene and often dumps garbage on the side of the road, urinates everywhere, and spits arbitrarily on the streets.

It is therefore urgent to strictly ban these habits in order to emphasize hygiene. In addition to ordering its subordinates to strictly ban these habits, it is hereby announced to the public that anyone who deliberately violates these rules will be punished without leniency.

<h3 id="e61">The Philippines: Past and Present <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Elector</p>
<p>Politics, Finance, and Banking</p>
<p>Since 1908, when the United States seized full power over the Philippines from the Spanish, it has stationed a governor in Manila to rule the entire Philippines, which is essentially a disguised colonial regime. Later, in order to promote the economic prosperity of the United States and to reasonably satisfy the needs of the Philippine people, in 1934, the United States allowed the Philippines to become independent in a short period of time, passing a bill stipulating that the constitution should be completed in 1936, submitted to the US President for approval, and after the establishment of the independent government in the Philippines, the United States would completely abandon any political power over the Philippines after ten years. By 1935, the new constitution had been passed, and Quezon was elected as the first president, establishing an independent government. The president is in charge of the legislative, executive, and judicial powers.</p>
<p>(1) Legislative power, according to the constitution, belongs to the National Assembly. The National Assembly adopts a unicameral system, composed of 120 publicly elected members with a term of three years. It holds a regular session once a year to review laws and budgets, but everything follows the American parliamentary system. The National Assembly may send one member as a resident commissioner to the United States, occupying a seat in the US Congress and being granted the right to speak as a representative of the Philippines. Local councils include the city councils of the six major cities of Manila, Panqi, Cebu, Yiru, Nana, and Sanbaoyan, the state councils of other states, and the village councils of various villages.</p>
<p>(2) In terms of administration, the independent autonomous government has eight departments, including the Department of Interior, Education, Finance, Justice, National Defense, Labor, Agriculture and Commerce, Public Works, and Transportation, as well as the Accounting Inspection Section and the Civil Service Bureau directly under the President. Each department has a minister, and the directly affiliated agencies have directors and bureau chiefs. There is also a vice president, who is also elected by the people in accordance with the presidential law, and exercises his functions in the president's absence, and also serves as the Minister of Education. Local administration includes the mayors of six cities and the governors of forty-nine states. Mayors are appointed by the President, and governors are publicly elected by the state's residents, except in special cases. The mayor of the capital, Manila, is often the most powerful politician, with the hope of becoming a presidential candidate in the future.</p>
<p>(3) In terms of the judiciary, there are the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, the Court of First Instance, the Court of the Peace, and the Manila City Court. All officials are nominated by the National Assembly and appointed by the President.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also the Philippine High Commissioner's Office, representing the US government and stationed in the Philippines. Its officials are appointed by the US President and stationed in Manila. It is the liaison agency between the US and Philippine governments and the highest supervisor of Philippine administration.</p>
<p>The Philippine finance has always been based on complete self-determination. All government expenses are entirely borne by Philippine taxpayers. Since the Second European War, government revenue and expenditure have decreased. Looking at the comparison of the government budget for 1941 with that of 1940:</p>
<p>The main part of the special revenue is the tax revenue from licenses and business tax, import tax, consumption, and income tax.</p>
<p>The financial power of the Philippines has always been in the hands of the Americans. On March 2, 1903, the new currency system established the gold exchange standard with a rate of two pesos to one US dollar. The right to issue currency and exchange coupons belongs to the Ministry of Finance, but the Philippine National Bank and the Bank of the Philippine Islands have a small amount of issuance rights. The currency circulation situation in March 1940 was as follows (unit: one peso):</p>
<p>One peso silver coins: 4,198,073</p>
<p>One-half peso silver coins: 3,979,967</p>
<p>Subsidiary coins: 10,487,842</p>
<p>White bronze and copper coins: 4,065,741</p>
<p>Treasury exchange coupons: 157,573,378</p>
<p>Bank of the Philippine Islands coupons: 1,751,385</p>
<p>Philippine National Bank coupons: 3,459,853</p>
<p>Total on March 21, 1940: 185,523,239</p>
<p>Total on March 31, 1939: 189,421,464</p>
<p>Treasury exchange coupons are prepared at a percentage rate of 15,459,911 pesos in silver coins against 71,238,803.50 US dollars deposited in the United States.</p>
<p>Financial institutions are also centered on the banking industry, and the strength lies in foreign banks. Since 1939, in order to help independence, efforts have been made to strengthen financial institutions, establish agricultural and industrial banks and prepare for city banks, and establish agricultural credit cooperative organizations. Before the Greater East Asia War, there were national banks including the Philippine National Bank (head office in Manila, central bank, capital of 10 million pesos), the Bank of the Philippine Islands (head office in Manila, the oldest bank in the Philippines, a legacy of the Spanish era, capital of 6.77 million pesos), and the Central China Bank (head office in Manila, funded by overseas Chinese, capital of 10 million pesos). In addition, there are the Philippine Trust Company, Savings Bank, Agricultural and Industrial Bank, and Preparation City Bank. Foreign banks include the National Bank of New York, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Chartered Bank, Yokohama Specie Bank, and the Bank of Communications of China. Special financial institutions include farmers' credit cooperatives, postal savings banks, and "Kasiki" (a type of usury with annual interest rates ranging from 25% to 2500%).</p>
<p>Economic Situation Before the Greater East Asia War</p>
<p>The Philippine economy relies entirely on foreign trade. If the trade environment changes, the economy will be hit. Seventy to eighty percent of export trade is with the United States. Therefore, as long as US-Philippine trade is normal, there will be no problems with the Philippine economy. For example, during the huge wave of the world agricultural panic after the previous war, the production of major agricultural products such as sugar, coconut dried, coconut oil, Manila hemp, and tobacco was able to avoid the panic and pass safely due to the artificial protection of US-Philippine free trade. However, when the Second World War broke out and before the Greater East Asia War, the Philippine economy faced a crisis that was not easy to solve.</p>
<p>The European war caused the Philippines to lose the European market, and the intensification of world opposition exacerbated the crisis between Japan and the United States. The Philippine Asian market was also on the verge of being lost. Even US-Philippine trade, which was the lifeblood of the Philippine economy, encountered unprecedented difficulties due to the surge in freight and insurance costs. In July 1941, the United States requisitioned a large number of ships due to the urgent needs of the Atlantic, which further intensified these difficulties. Furthermore, due to the Philippine Export Control Order of May 28, 1941, and the Asset Freeze Order against China and Japan on July 26, the Philippines not only lost the East Asian market starting with Japan, but also deepened the trade crisis due to the inability to use Japanese ships.</p>
<p>The Philippines itself felt that its own ships were insufficient (77,000 tons of ocean-going ships), and all foreign trade relied on foreign ships. Due to the British ships leaving the Philippines one after another during the European war, and the asset freeze making Japanese ships unusable, the shortage of ships was very serious. Take a look at the changes in the ship allocation status of various countries in Philippine trade (percentage).</p>

<h3 id="e66">Finding Ways to Eradicate Speculation - Yesterday's Commentary from the Continental News <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The Continental News' commentary on February 19th stated: "In the past two or three months, prices have slightly receded, but at the beginning of this month, prices were seen to surge again, rendering the authorities' policy of suppressing and stabilizing prices ineffective. High prices are the greatest suffering for the people and a major obstacle to economic construction. Therefore, the issue of price stabilization is an urgent matter that must not be relaxed. Looking back at past price policies, they have been too lenient and passive. The key to the price problem lies in increasing production, not just in using suppression methods. In China's current environment, it is necessary to consider all special conditions, while simultaneously enhancing production and strictly curbing speculative behavior."</p>
<p>"The biggest reason for high prices in Shanghai is hoarding caused by speculative [activities]. If effective measures can be taken against such situations, Shanghai's prices can be stabilized. Since the [Sino-Japanese] Incident, after national capital lost its legitimate outlets, it has been dedicated to speculation, such as speculative buying and selling in foreign exchange, margin trading, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth. However, recently, due to the rigorous crackdown on speculation, large amounts of capital have been unable to be utilized, leading to a resurgence of hoarding and driving up prices. Furthermore, from another perspective, although speculative transactions have been reduced by the authorities' crackdown, they have not been completely eradicated. Margin trading and secret trading of foreign currencies are still active in the shadows. Upon further observation, targets such as hoarding are all for speculation. If this phenomenon continues, the policy of suppressing and stabilizing prices will be ineffective."</p>
<p>"Although the current inventory levels in Shanghai cannot be ascertained, it is estimated that 70-80% have been seized by speculators and hoarded without being released. There is no doubt about this fact. Only 20-30% remains on the market, but even this is being competitively purchased due to the excess of floating capital. If the spot goods on the market decrease, the price of the hoarders' inventory will naturally be high. The more exhausted the market's resources, the more expensive the black market prices for hoarded goods, allowing capitalists active in the black market to reap huge profits. We must first focus on this fact, while also considering the social psychology created by speculative hoarding. The motto of hoarders is that scarcity equals high prices, which leads to manifold profits. Therefore, the mentality of speculators is that they hope for low production, scarce resources, and increased currency issuance, and they do not want the international situation to improve. What ordinary people consider pessimistic, they consider optimistic. What the people are happy about, they take as painful. They must profit greatly when internal and external situations deteriorate. This kind of thinking is unimaginable to ordinary people. Most of China's capitalists today do not reflect on their actions and only know speculation, hoarding, and profiteering. We urgently hope that the Chinese and Japanese authorities will make a major decision to crack down on speculation, and at the same time, hope that the crackdown on speculation will not be limited to superficial work, but will be implemented effectively, ordering the cessation of all economic activities aimed at speculation, especially the crackdown on hoarding of a speculative nature."</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e67">Floating Capital Movements and Prices in Various Regions <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the year, prices have risen sharply. According to those familiar with the banking industry: "Current deposits in various banks in this city have shown a decline." This is said to be a reflection of the resurgence of commodity speculation; we dare not agree. If it were a resurgence of commodity speculation, it would only promote the movement of deposits between banks, and would not cause a general decline in deposits across all banks. The recent general decline in deposits in various banks should be the result of capital moving from this city to the interior.</p>
<p>Since July of last year, the movement of prices in this city has generally changed from a state of sharp increases to a state of gradual progress. For example, the index in July was 2930 points, August 2996 points, September 3035 points, and October 3042 points. The indices for November and December have not yet been seen. Based on the market situation at that time, the general trend was still a gradual increase. However, since January of this year, the situation has changed, with a sharp rise in grain prices leading the way, followed by securities prices. During the red market of the Lunar New Year, this rising trend spread to the general commodity market, and is now even more intense.</p>
<p>Comparing the current rising price trend in Shanghai with that in the interior, there are some noteworthy differences. Let's take Nanjing's prices to represent the commodity market in the interior. In July of last year, it was 2753 points. In August and September, it showed a sharp decline, with September at 2337 points. However, starting in October, it rebounded. In October, it increased sharply to 2721 points, and in November it increased even further to 3245 points. Indices since December have not been seen, but based on the sharp rise in prices in the Qingxiang District in January as reported in yesterday's newspaper, it can be seen that the extent of price increases in the interior is actually greater than that in Shanghai at the same time.</p>
<p>In the past, Shanghai's prices often led to price increases in the interior. Looking at the situation above, it can be said that interior prices are now leading Shanghai's prices, which is not impossible. Therefore, the nature of capital moving from this city to the interior needs to be strictly observed.</p>
<p>The accumulation of floating capital in Shanghai makes everyone uneasy, because it does not engage in production and becomes a reserve force for speculation. Therefore, all sectors are eager for it to move out of the city and invest in the interior. This aspiration can now be said to be partially becoming a reality, but the result has been a situation where interior prices dominate Shanghai prices. This shows that the interior has not rationally absorbed this floating capital, but is also using it maliciously. This shows that in dealing with the problem of floating capital, paying attention to its use is more important than adjusting its location.</p>

<p>The Continental News of February 19th reported: "According to the Central Reserve Bank's statistics on remittances handled in the first half of the 31st year [of the Republic], there has been a gradual increase since January. This phenomenon proves the progress of material communication and the revival of inland economic power. It is expected that economic ties between Shanghai and the interior will become closer in the future. It is reported that the total amount of remittances received and paid is approximately 150 billion yuan, and the ratio of the head office to branches is the highest in Shanghai, accounting for approximately 85% of the total."</p>

<p>Recently, local authorities in this city, in order to curb speculation and stabilize prices, have taken strict action against various transactions that have gone off track. Although trading in Chinese stocks is not within the scope of the prohibition, due to the repeated surge in stock prices since the Lunar New Year, the Chinese stock market was temporarily closed yesterday in accordance with the authorities' wishes. All stock companies in this city have also suspended trading accordingly. The date of resumption has not yet been decided.</p>

<p>In order to increase production, the Su-Huai authorities have decided to vigorously promote rural production this year. It is planned to establish a production promotion office with an expenditure of 100,000 yuan to handle production-related matters, and agricultural warehouses will be prepared in various counties to facilitate agricultural production.

<p>Yesterday's public bond market saw mostly flat conditions at first. Only Category C bonds rose sharply due to short covering. Other categories also rose accordingly. Later, Category C even saw new prices. As a result, all categories rebounded by a few jiao to two jiao. For example, Category C bonds initially traded at 79 yuan, a sharp drop of more than one yuan from the previous day. Afterwards, due to short covering, it rose steadily, eventually reaching a new high of 82.67 yuan. As for Category A at 8.5 yuan, Category B at 7 yuan to 7.5 yuan, Category D at 4.5 yuan to 6.5 yuan, and Category E at 5.5 yuan to 8.5 yuan, all were stable.</p>

<p>Reliable data on the supply and demand situation of yarn and cloth in North China is lacking. However, for the whole of China, there are government survey figures, the content of which is as follows (yarn in bales, cloth in square yards):</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Supply 2,027,500</p>
<p>Domestic Production 2,000,000</p>
<p>Foreign Imports 27,500</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Supply 1,420 million</p>
<p>Domestic Production 1,000 million</p>
<p>Foreign Imports 420 million</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Demand 2,027,500</p>
<p>Domestic Consumption 1,976,300</p>
<p>Exports to Foreign Countries 5,200</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Demand 1,420 million</p>
<p>Domestic Consumption 920 million</p>
<p>Exports to Foreign Countries 500 million</p>
<p>In terms of cotton yarn, of the aforementioned domestic consumption of 3 million bales, 100,000 bales are used for making thread and other items, and 1.9 million bales are used for weaving cloth, which is estimated to weave 2.3 billion square yards of native cloth. Combined with the aforementioned domestic consumption of cotton cloth, it totals 3.3 billion square yards. China's population is approximately 400 million, averaging approximately 8 square yards per person. Adding in some smuggled goods, the average per person is around 10 square yards (this number is not much different from the government's report to the League of Nations of 9.5 square yards). North China's population is approximately 100 million. At this rate, it needs 1 billion square yards of cotton cloth annually.</p>

Company Announcements Companies must undergo public announcement procedures for opening, commencing operations, and convening shareholder meetings, etc. According to Article 88 of the Company Law: "The method for a company to make public announcements shall be specified in the articles of association." This means that the law allows the parties of the company to specify the method of public announcement in the articles of association themselves. Whether using only circulars or newspaper announcements, both will be effective. The law does not impose any mandatory requirements. According to current practice, most companies' articles of association specify that "company announcements shall be made by circular or by publishing in a widely circulated daily newspaper."</p>
<p>3. Shareholder Voting Rights In order to restrict large shareholders from manipulating the company, Article 129 of the Company Law stipulates: "Each shareholder of the company shall have one vote per share. A shareholder with more than eleven shares shall have their voting rights restricted in the articles of association..." This means that shareholders holding more than eleven shares must have their voting rights discounted in the articles of association, that is, calculated at a certain discount rate. Those less than one right may not be counted. The common practice is to discount by 90%, 80%, or at most 50%. Furthermore, the total number of votes that each shareholder can exercise, including those exercised by proxy for other shareholders, shall not exceed one-fifth of the total voting rights of all shareholders, as stipulated in Article 129 of the Company Law. This should be noted at any time when holding establishment meetings or shareholder meetings.</p>
<p>4. Qualifications for Shareholders to be Elected as Directors and Supervisors When drafting the company's articles of association, entrepreneurial individuals often set excessively high restrictions on the number of shares required for directors and supervisors to be elected, intending to make it difficult to be elected, so that the directors and supervisors produced will not be excessively numerous and cause a chaotic situation. However, Article 21 of the Implementation Law of the Company Law stipulates: "When the number of shares is used as the standard to stipulate the qualifications for directors and supervisors to be elected, the value of the shares shall not exceed three-thousandths of the total capital for directors, and shall not exceed one-thousandth for supervisors." Since the law has this restriction, the articles of association of the company shall not stipulate the qualification of shares for the election of directors and supervisors beyond the aforementioned percentage. Assuming the company has a capital of 500,000 yuan, divided into 50,000 shares, then at most it can be stipulated that shareholders with more than 150 shares are qualified to be elected as directors, and shareholders with more than 50 shares are qualified to be elected as supervisors to be legal; exceeding this number is illegal. If the number is lower than the prescribed amount, such as the qualification for election as a director being less than three-thousandths, the supervisor being less than one-thousandth, or even stipulating that all shareholders are qualified to be elected as directors and supervisors, the law does not prohibit this.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Development of Currency Work in Central China (II) <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Reasons for the Improvement of its Position:</p>
<p>Now we may be able to find various reasons for the rising position of military scrip.</p>
<p>First, it cannot be denied that it is due to the smooth implementation of the military scrip recovery work. Currently, there are material exchange offices and trade associations in Central China for military scrip recovery work, but most of the commodities distributed in the Central China peace zone are handled by trade associations and transferred to the interior in stages. This is where military scrip plays a significant role in preventing materials from flowing into the war zone. The settlement of accounts for these associations' items is carried out exclusively with military scrip under the supervision of the military authorities. After the start of the Greater East Asia War, the guaranteed reserves of military scrip became difficult to import from Japan, so the associations have also begun to use local rural materials as guaranteed reserves. Given this, the improved position of military scrip cannot be denied as attributable to the activity of the Central China Trade Association. To ensure that military scrip has sufficient guaranteed reserves, a well-functioning distribution mechanism is the only powerful pillar for the development of military scrip.</p>
<p>Second, the inflation of the old legal tender has also contributed to the improved position of military scrip. Even if the old legal tender still maintains its credibility among the Chinese people, its over-issuance and the productivity behind it will not support it forever. From a fundamental perspective, since the promulgation of the asset freeze order in August of last year, the old legal tender cannot be freely exchanged for foreign currencies. After the start of the Greater East Asia War, the possibility of exchanging the old legal tender for foreign currencies has become a nominal antique. In the past, it was necessary to purchase old legal tender with savings scrip, military scrip, and Lianhe scrip before being able to buy European and American goods, but now there is no need to be so polite, and the old legal tender can be directly attacked: because it has become a useless long object, there is no need to maintain the equivalence of new and old legal tender, and further recover the old legal tender and prohibit its circulation in major areas. Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the amount of old legal tender issued was one hundred and several tens of billions of yuan, and now it is probably more than two hundred billion yuan, which not only leads to malignant inflation, but also in terms of its nature, that is, in its use, it is heading for a declining fate, while the active use of military scrip and savings scrip is flourishing.</p>
<p>Third, the objective situation also welcomes the increase in military scrip. Shortly after the promulgation of the aforementioned asset freeze order, the Greater East Asia War broke out, resulting in the recovery of the Shanghai Concession and the expulsion of European and American forces, so that European and American goods that had always been imported through the Concession also disappeared from China. However, as mentioned above, Japanese goods are traded through the Trade Association and material exchange offices, using only military scrip. Without military scrip, daily necessities cannot be obtained. This is why military scrip has made great strides even into the most difficult-to-penetrate rural areas: because daily necessities must be bought with military scrip, it is necessary to exchange one's own local products for military scrip.</p>
<p>The future of developing military scrip work is still not optimistic at present. Although military scrip has penetrated the countryside as mentioned above, most of the purchase of inland local products still cannot be done without the old legal tender. To completely replace China's national capital with a military scrip coat is truly a pipe dream, because the amount of military scrip issued is truly a drop in the ocean compared to the huge amount of old legal tender.

<p>Yesterday, bean cake transactions in the miscellaneous grain market saw a slight decline. The market trend turned slightly weak, because the military allocation group transferred 50,000 pieces of cheap bean cakes to the miscellaneous grain group, which the group sold out in the market. This resulted in a sudden increase in chips and a gradual decline in buying interest. Kaiyuanlong bean cakes: two carloads, price 121.5 yuan. Yingfei and Lizi bean cakes, March delivery: 3,000 pieces, price 122.5 yuan to 121 yuan. Shanghai factory bean cakes, March delivery: 4,000 pieces, price 122 yuan to 121 yuan.</p>

<p>Hong Kong, February 18th, Domei News Agency: Hong Kong Governor Rensuke Isogai stated at a press conference held at the Hong Kong Government House on the first anniversary of its establishment on February 20th: "Hong Kong is still handling repatriation matters, providing various conveniences as much as possible. Those who reside in Hong Kong in the future should be people with professions and jobs. As for Hong Kong's economic position, it is a relay port, so all facilities and production should be based on this point. For example, shipbuilding is currently in progress, so as to be able to transport oil and various other materials from the southern region. Several of these ships have been launched, and more ships will be completed this year, which will enhance Hong Kong's economic position. As for industry, factories under military management will be transferred to private management as soon as possible, and Chinese-run businesses will be encouraged."</p>

Among the 20 types, only Wing On Company of the department store industry increased its shares by 500,000 shares in mid-March, but because the increase was very small (one-third of the total capital), it is still included. Apart from this, all other stocks have share prices at a time when the number of shares and capital have not been changed within one year. As for stocks such as National Goods Company, China Bookstore, World Bookstore, Kangyuan Canning, and Sino-British Dispensary, all have either changed their face value or increased capital within one year, and their year-end stock prices cannot be compared with other stocks. For example, National Goods only increased by 1.25 times throughout the year; China three times; and World 2.5 times; this is because the face value has changed.</p>

<p>Havas World News Agency, Lisbon, 18th: According to a report from Washington, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture and War Food Administrator Wickard stated to the press this month that the U.S. market is full of profiteering merchants and black market traders, the number of whom is alarmingly large. All kinds of goods have black markets, which will endanger the government's rationing plan, especially in the area of meat. This phenomenon is most obvious. In addition, it is also understood that Secretary Wickard has requested the military authorities to allow thousands of soldiers to go home on leave to engage in agricultural work, but this plan has been opposed by General of the Army Marshall, so the manpower panic in the U.S. agricultural sector is still very serious.</p>

<p>— Liu Po</p>
<p>Beggars and vagrants on the street, standing in front of porridge shops or noodle stands, only hope to be able to eat a bowl of thin porridge or plain noodles; but they have no money and cannot eat, so they feel very painful.</p>
<p>Poor people living in attics or kitchen sheds are heavily in debt. They hope to be able to pay off their debts, but they often spend tomorrow's income today, and have no extra money to pay off their debts, so they feel very painful.</p>
<p>People living in front buildings or shared tenement buildings have just enough salary to cover their expenses and live a mediocre life. They hope to save a little, but often cannot, so they feel very painful.</p>
<p>People living in entire lane houses have some savings. Before the incident, they only had a few thousand dollars. After the incident, following big speculators, they engaged in hoarding, buying and selling shellac, cloth, and stocks. The amount of savings has become tens or hundreds of thousands. However, seeing a group of people who made a fortune from "wartime wealth" from scratch, they are envious and jealous, feeling unsatisfied and very painful.</p>
<p>People living in large Western-style houses had hundreds of thousands or millions in property before the incident. When the incident was about to happen, they cleverly turned their property into foreign exchange, US dollars, and shellac like cunning rabbits. As the incident prolonged, they seized opportunities to stir up trouble, buying cotton yarn one moment, hoarding goods the next, trading foreign stocks one moment, and trading Chinese stocks the next. They are busy, they are anxious. Their hearts are very painful, not for life, but for property. Sometimes, they sigh to poor friends, saying: "It is better to be a person without money, it is really painful to have money!"</p>
<p>In short, to sum it up, people without money cannot survive and suffer for survival. People with little money suffer from the desire for more money. The rich and wealthy suffer from fear of loss, entirely for the sake of property.</p>
<p>People who suffer from not being able to survive make up the majority of society; they are the most pitiful, and their suffering must be relieved. As for those who suffer from fear of loss for the sake of property, their suffering is self-inflicted and not worthy of pity.</p>
<p>If there is any proper way to allow people who cannot make a living to barely survive; to allow people whose property exceeds what is necessary for life to distribute the excess portion for the benefit of society; to reduce the pain caused by too little or too much money, this would be a great act of compassion and saving people from suffering, an unparalleled undertaking.</p>
<p>Holding charity dances or putting on plays to help with disaster relief occasionally is understandable. If it is done again and again, it becomes ridiculous. At present, what seems more effective is to control prices and ban various forms of speculation on the one hand, and to levy income tax, excessive profit tax, and property tax on the other.</p>
<h3 id="e90">World's Largest Fire Hazard; Impossible to Extinguish After 58 Years <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>It is reported that the authorities of Ohio in the United States are currently trying to extinguish a fire that has been burning for more than 50 years in a coal mine near Hocking Hills, intending to use fire-extinguishing gas and chemical methods to stop it from burning. According to reports, the coal mine has been on fire for as long as 58 years. In 1884, several striking miners set fire to a mine in Ohio, unexpectedly causing a prairie fire, turning into a huge disaster. To date, approximately 28 million tons of coal have been burned, and there is still no way to put it out. Nearby residents have also helplessly let it run its course, and when the fire threatens to reach the ground, they advise moving to a better location to avoid its sharp edge. Recently, a school near the area planned to relocate because the ground was unbearably hot. According to geological surveys, the underground flames are only six yards from the surface, so the climate is particularly warm. Whenever it is cloudy and rainy, hot air is often seen permeating and entering the doors and windows of households, and phosphorus fire can be seen from afar at night. Also, because the climate is warm, plants grow very easily, but if the fire approaches the surface, the plants growing on the ground will immediately wither. In the past, although efforts were made to extinguish the fire, they were unsuccessful. Although concrete walls were built around the fire to prevent its spread, the firepower was too strong, the mud walls collapsed, and the flames still crossed the walls. Only recently have scientists been put in charge of extinguishing the fire, and it is expected that the latest methods can stop the spread of underground flames. Investigations reveal that there have also been coal mine fires in Europe, which can serve as a lesson for American engineers today. For example, in 1860, a coal mine in Saguessou in France also burned. It is said that the origin of the fire dates back to the 16th century. The "Warm Hall" in England is another example. The British used the heat of the ground to grow tropical plants and used the hottest places to boil water, but after only a few years, the underground flames changed course and the "Warm Hall" lost its heat, and the tropical flowers and plants withered, and the "Warm Hall" lost its name.

<h3 id="e91">About "Two Generations of Women" <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Qu Jiang</p>
<p>Recently, it seems that someone is trying hard to promote "Two Generations of Women." If it were just a few ordinary compliments, honestly speaking, I, who rarely watch movies, would not join in the fun. But when I saw words like "strong artistic nature" and "not easily accepted by low-brow audiences," a lofty feeling immediately surged in my heart. On the one hand, I rejoiced for the weak Chinese film industry, and on the other hand, I was very willing to buy a ticket to the Great Light Cinema. This is not deliberately trying to be elegant and be a "high-level audience," but because we, who are struggling in the torments of life, need the edification of art, as urgently as we need air!</p>
<p>I know what ordinary Chinese movies are like. I hope "Two Generations of Women" can break my prejudice, but...</p>
<p>I would like to write down my feelings and impressions after watching it. Please do not think that I am deliberately arguing with the gentlemen who recommended the film, and I would be grateful for further corrections.</p>
<p>(1) Dialogue I agree with that gentleman's statement: "This film probably has the most dialogue in Chinese films." But I cannot agree that this alone makes it a good film. If Xi Shi had pockmarks, does that mean that everyone with pockmarks is Xi Shi? Of course, art films must have dialogue, but having dialogue does not necessarily make it an art film.</p>
<p>It is impossible to prove with words alone, but I did not buy a special issue, so I have to rely on my memory to record a few of the dialogues that I found to be lacking in sense:</p>
<p>Meng Na (who plays the mother) refers to herself as "this old woman." Although she is an incomparably dignified mother-in-law in the film, she should not be so incoherent as to say that.</p>
<p>Perhaps what is called "strong artistic nature" refers to this:</p>
<p>Meng Na: I do not belong to this era... A sacred cause has disappeared from the earth... That is the cause of being a mother...</p>
<p>If it were not specifically noted that this is a line from "Two Generations of Women," would you believe that these are the words of a incense-burning old lady in her seventies?</p>
<p>(2) Director The director is closely related to the script. If the script is not good, the director cannot make it good. But the director should still be responsible for individual scenes.</p>
<p>For example, the scene of looking at photos in "Two Generations of Women." If there were a good director, I think it would be very exciting. I remember a scene in the American film "The Animal Kingdom" that is very similar. A wild girl, the wife of a small farm owner (played by Betty Field, I remember), secretly wants to meet her lover. Her father-in-law is in charge of her and does not allow her to go out. There is no extra dialogue here. We only see a close-up of Betty Field's face. Everything in the room is quiet. Only the "tick-tock" of the clock breaks this unbearable silence... This is such a powerful description.</p>
<p>(3) Character According to the first point, the dialogue is so unreasonable. How can we talk about the "character" of Meng Na? In the film, Meng Na seems to have the most scenes. Meng Na is already like this, so the others are not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>(4) Picture "Picture" should mean that the director gives appropriate treatment to the characters' positions, making the entire composition a "picture." This cannot be found in "Two Generations of Women." Some people say: antique decorations, winding corridors, beautiful natural scenery... I think these are not what is meant by "picture" in film. If these are what we are looking for, why not just go and buy a set of the Ten Scenes of West Lake?</p>
<p>Finally, I have to admit that I did not finish watching this film. I only saw Gu Lanjun climbing on Mei Xi, saying, "Why don't you let us sleep in one room?" Then, her eyes narrowed, her hand rested on Mei Xi's back, her feet tiptoed, and she shouted, "Kiss me? Kiss me!..." and I left. Call me a defender of morality if you will, but such a "high-level art film" that is "rich in social significance" feels a bit dazzling to me.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Third Place in the January Essay Contest My Life as a Teacher (Part 2) <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Si Yiwei</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the aspect of life Teaching has always been a hard work. This is the case in normal times, let alone in this special era. The school where I teach, comparatively speaking, does not have very meager treatment. However, the rise in prices is endless, and the income is only enough to take care of a few mouths. Therefore, everything has to be done in a simple and crude way. There is no way to increase income. Private tutoring is not allowed by the school, nor is it possible in reality, so I have to economize everywhere. Simple vegetarian meals, flour dumplings, and corn porridge are surprisingly delicious. I used to take third-class in the tram, and now I still take third-class. There is nothing to be said about its rise and fall in status. All the work at home, if I can handle it, I do it myself. I repair the electric lights and running water if they are broken, and I repair the tools and utensils if they are broken. I never ask someone to do it unless there is absolutely no way to do it. The clothes are patched and turned over, only seeking to be neat and tidy, not counting the style. The briefcase I am using now was passed down from my grandfather. The edges are so broken that the pencil is about to leak out. I wanted to sell it to the junk collector for a long time. Now I have repaired it, and I go out early and return late. Not only do I put textbooks in it, but sometimes even dry food is in it, and I regard it as a treasure. Lu Fangweng said in a poem, "Poverty is not a shame for scholars." This has been the case in ancient and modern times.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the aspect of self-cultivation The most painful thing in my life is my health problem. Because of my many illnesses, I don't know how much I have suffered! Since the incident, life has become more and more difficult. If I get sick again, I will have no money for medical expenses! So I decided to fight against the disease. Three years ago, I started learning Tai Chi. I understood the physiological effects and the principles of exercise. I go to the park at dawn, unless it rains or snows. I dare not stop for a day in winter or summer. In the past three years, I feel that my body has improved a lot. In the past, because I was often sick, I was pessimistic about everything and felt dissatisfied with everything. The war has become a turning point for me. Now I only seek to do my best, only seek to have a clear conscience in everything, only seek to be able to endure hunger and cold for my family, and put wealth and fame out of my mind. I don't smoke or drink, and mahjong never enters my door. I rarely watch movies unless everyone says they are good. I have never set foot in dance halls. After being tired of grading papers, I either casually flip through selections of classical poems or plant some flowers and plants in pots on the corner of the window. On sunny Sundays, I always take my family for a walk in the park. I love nature. In the afternoon, I attend worship or listen to famous speakers, so that my spirituality can also be cultivated. The busier and more difficult it is, the more important I feel that self-cultivation is for myself.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the aspect of duties For my duties, I only hold one word, sincerity. Twenty-some hours a week are enough to exhaust my energy and hoarse my voice. In the time I have, I grade test papers, coming and going, and I have to spend one or two hours in the car. So it goes without saying that I am busy and bitter! Teaching originally has no standards. You can give students grades without looking at the papers, and no one will notice! You can step onto the podium without preparing, and talk casually for one or two hours, and few students dare to question it. Sadly, the heavy burden of life forces many colleagues in the education field to take on forty or fifty hours a week, running around and struggling to cope, and they have to take this path that they should not take. It is painful to say. Although I am also busy and suffering enough, I have never dared to deal with this work sloppily. For the few papers that fail, I have to read them one or two more times in order to make up for it and not make them suffer injustice. When treating students, in the classroom, I have always been strict, but outside the classroom, I advocate amiability. I like them to chat casually after class. In the laboratory, I let them learn to be automatic and ask them to pay attention to accuracy. Unless there is an unexpected obstacle on the road, I never dare to be one or two minutes late to enter the classroom. I don't like to lecture with a textbook. Everywhere, I hope to speak vividly. For questions I can't answer, I honestly say I can't answer them. I advise them not to completely trust the teacher, nor can they completely rely on the book. They must all have a bit of skepticism and think carefully. I am very careful about my words and deeds, so as not to be used as a handle by them, thus losing their faith in me. I always feel that sincerity and diligence are the best methods. Not only can it move people, but if there is a mistake, it is easy to get their understanding.</p>
<p>Writing casually, I have exceeded the number limit. What I said is just a review of my personal life. As for the sorrows that should be sighed, there are few from university professors to kindergarten teachers who do not sympathize with each other. No one in society does not know that teaching is a poor job. I don't intend to go into details here! However, I always feel that in this poor life, education has its own great mission, and we are really responsible for these many students. The darkness and corruption in our society, such as bribery, deception, greed, and selfishness, are mostly the result of poor education. We can only stand on our own positions and work hard to do our part. We can only look at the students' enthusiasm for learning and progress as food to quench our thirst. Of course, we very much hope that society can find a way to stabilize our lives, and we must also give full play to our teaching principles.</p>

<p>— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>When Chips entered this chaotic center, everyone immediately quieted down, followed by bursts of continuous cheers: everyone stared at him with eager, shining eyes, as if staring at a symbol of victory. He walked to a higher section of the dining hall, as if he was going to speak; they were silent for him, but after a while, he shook his head, smiled, and walked away.</p>
<p>It was a damp and foggy day, and he shivered as he walked across the quadrangle to the dining hall. The next day, he developed bronchitis, did not get out of bed, and spent Christmas in bed. However, after going to the dining hall on the evening of November 11, he had already submitted his resignation to the school board.</p>
<p>When the school reopened after the holidays, he returned to Mrs. Wickett's house. At his own request, no farewell party or gifts were given to him. Nothing more than a handshake with his successor and crossing out the word "acting" on the official documents. "The term is over."</p>
<p>(Sixteen)</p>
<p>Now, fifteen years later, he can look back on everything in the past with peace of mind. He is certainly not sick - but from time to time there is some fatigue, and in the winter, breathing is not very smooth. He does not want to go abroad - he tried it once, and as soon as he arrived at the Riviera, he just happened to catch a cold snap, an unknown cold snap. "I would rather - um - be cold in my own country - ahem -" he would say that after this incident. When the east wind blows, he must be careful, but the autumn and winter seasons are not really that bad; there is a warm fire, books, and you can look forward to summer. Of course; he likes summer the most, the summer weather suits him, in addition; there are constant visits from old students. At the end of each week, some old students will take a car to Brookfield to visit him. Sometimes too many people come at once, which will tire him; but he doesn't really care; he can often rest and sleep. He likes their visits - more than anything else in the world that still pleases him. (Forty-one)</p>

<h3 id="e94">Relieving the Poor and Sick; Notre Dame Calls on All Sectors to Donate Funds to the Hospital <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The Catholic Society for the Salvation of Souls, founded by the nuns of the Yangjingbang in Shanghai, has been in operation for seventy years. It specializes in educating children and relieving the poor and sick. The schools under its jurisdiction have 4,000 students, and the clinics under its jurisdiction provide free or semi-fee treatment to the poor, reaching more than 112,000 people a year. For poor families, they try to provide work or accommodate their children, providing food and lodging. The poor who come to ask for help every day are given food and clothing or a small amount of money. However, in recent years, with the high cost of living, it has become difficult to maintain the business. The hospital has no choice but to appeal to all sectors, asking all benefactors to donate generously. No matter how much or little the gold or material is, it can be contacted directly with the hospital.</p>

<p>— Ding Fubao</p>
<p>When I was young, I was often sick and physically weak. When I was in my twenties, I weighed less than ninety pounds. So I was determined to transform my weak body and adopted various health care methods such as quietness, sunlight, air, exercise, deep breathing, and vegetables, fruits, and milk. I also used meditation methods that concentrated the mind on the acupuncture point of the mysterious gate and methods for transforming destiny. Later, my sick body was indeed cured. At the age of forty, I was stronger than at thirty, at fifty I was stronger than at forty, and at sixty I was stronger than at fifty. Now that I am seventy, my physical strength and spirit are even stronger than when I was sixty. I have gained some experience in the art of conditioning my body. In order to serve society, I plan to contribute various methods of curing diseases, recuperation, health, and longevity that I have personally experimented with to those who are physically weak, anemic, dyspeptic, neurasthenic, or have excessive lust in their youth or middle age, or those who have high blood pressure, hardening of the arteries, excessive obesity, or diseases of the kidneys, heart, or liver, as well as those with chronic diseases who have taken medicine and acupuncture for years without seeing results. Regardless of gender, age, or age, they can all learn to see small results in three months and big results in six months. If they can be determined and unwavering, they will surely be able to achieve the goal of curing diseases and prolonging life without a doubt.</p>
<p>(Mr. Ding is now scheduled to lecture every Sunday morning from 10:00 to 11:00 at the China Health Care Company in the Meiqi Building, No. 996 Jing'an Temple Road. All sectors are welcome to join the society and attend the lectures. The company can be contacted for the regulations.)</p>
