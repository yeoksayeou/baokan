<p>社評</p>
<h3>自期期人</h3>
<p>就正於宣傳會議與同業諸君子</p>
<p>宣傳部為檢討全國　傳工作，加强戰時宣傳體制，召集關係機關團體代表，舉行第二屆全國宣傳會議，於今日開始在首都揭幕，會期凡三日。</p>
<p>最近時期，會議頗盛，以大東亞為範圍者，有大東亞會議，國民大會，新大會，靑少年指導者大會，體育大會　等。就國內言，有內政部的警政會議，實業部的地方經濟聯絡會議，衛生署的衛生行政會議，以及今日的宣傳會議。會議之目的，在於集思廣益，為元成共同目標而商討一　步驟。當然，這些都是求進步的好現象。</p>
<p>在國內外歷次會議中，我們輒就觀感所及，貢其」得之見，但於今日的宣傳會議，特別覺得一面興奮，一面警暢。因為報紙是宜傳中的一部門，宣傳會議討論的範圍，決定的方針，都與報紙有直接關係。興奮者，新聞事業的使命將益見重要；警惕者，新聞事業的責任將愈感艱鉅。因為使命重要，必須認淸目標，努力完成，因為責任艱鉅，必須不辭困難，奮勇肩負。我們今天的話，並非獻言於人，而是督，以自期期人：</p>
<p>第一，發動一種宣傳，必定有一個目實一宣傳的背後，一定要有事實佐證，那末，這個宣傳才有效，才能達到目標。所謂「事實」，不論正面反面，它的內容必定與宣傳的內容相一致的。譬如政治上軌道，經濟合理化，宣傳背後有了這種事實，那末，理直氣壯地發揮宣傳的能事，就容易取得大衆的信仟了。</p>
<p>第二，宣傳的技巧，是在時間或空間的比較上才能　出其高低的分野，背後無事實的宣傳，縱是運用技巧，仍屬費力多　而成效少的。其次好的技巧，不一定是恭維，不一定是歌功頌德；反之，一味歌頌的，却是拙劣的　傳技巧。技巧的要點，在於「適可」，在於對大衆，使一般人看了聽了，很易會心的信任，這是時間上得到技巧的成功。不但個人信任，同時推己及人，相互傳播，迅速普遍，這是空間上得到技巧的成功。</p>
<p>第三，目前的中央電訊社，事實上是發佈新聞的唯一機，在人事組織設備各方面，均須强化，使能負起責任。就報紙立塲，現在最困難者，為國內電訊之太少」與「太慢」，「太少」，則有時看不到國內新聞。有時量雖不少，而究其實質，仍嫌太少。「太慢」，則影　報紙之褊排草率，發行遲悮。電訊傳播，以敏捷為第一義，在時間上雖一分一秒也必竭力爭取。通訊社對於若干電訊，時間上許可提早發出者，更不應姗姗其遲。譬如南京在上午有會議消息，中央在拍發電訊到達各分社，分社褊送各報，論理至遲不會超過下午四時，俾各地晚報即可發表。如此，在報紙並非苛求，而在通訊社則為應該做到的起　條件。可是，就我們目前日常接觸的事實，則南京在上午發生的消息，上海各報往往至午夜二時左右，方始援到，有時甚至遲至四時以後，到時又連篇累幅，報紙為期不　誤發行時間，無法從容編排，遂難免草率脫漏之弊。通訊社與報紙在工作　形成如此各不相干的現象。尤其在目前中央電訊社為唯一的消息來源之情形下，此種現象，對於新聞事業的進步上，宜傳的成效上，當然有其嚴重的影響。我們盼望宜傳當局於中央社首先在人事方面調整，提高待遇，課以責任。其次，設備方面，設法充實；機構方面，合理强化。我們敢說，通訊機構與報業之間，工作上之脫節如此，而期望與督責新聞事業之進步，宜傳之强化，則不免流於高調。一方面，我們着眼於整個新聞事業的進步，當然不願諉過塞責，我們報紙立塲，自當盡力與通訊社取得聯絡，盡力謀本身工作的改進。</p>
<p>汪主席甘在三十年六月一日第一次全國宜傳會議時頒訂「宣傳工作人員訓條」十二項，共中第九項說「要說老實話，負責任」。確是宣傳工作者的座右銘。我們上面提供的三點，其重要意義實已包含在這一項裹，今天特再鄭重提出，願以之自期，並期之與會代表與同業諸君子。</p>
<h3>侵襲布加島敵機被擊落四十八架　南太平洋日空軍發揮威力</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　據南太平洋日軍某基地電：敵機百數十架曾於十七日來襲波根維爾島北方之布加島，日海軍機隊常即對之邀擊，擊落敵機四十八架，日方被害極輕微。</p>

<h3>波島大捷與　今後戰局動向</h3>
<p>美國企圖進行艦隊決戰</p>
<p>自波根維爾島特羅基那岬方面登陸以來，敵方的反攻·極為熾烈，不僅波根　兩島·並欲連新不列顛島亦欲於此時一氣攻下。這次出擊誠然是空前的。阻止敵方這一出擊行動的日本海軍航空部隊並水上艦艇之實·作戰，將永垂靑史？我們對此次珍珠灣以來的大戰果，一而表示無限感謝，同時，也絲毫不敢偷安，因為對方實在不能不說是可怖的敵人。這戰果誠極偉大，唯今如冷靜地觀察因這戰鬥所引起的諸情並推移時，不能徒然沉醉於戰果的美夢中。在南太平洋戰局上值得注目者：第一·這次戰鬥是因敵方出擊而發生的·自敵人受到很大的損害。第二·敵方的基地航空部隊今日依然力量雄厚，擁有　多戰鬥機，轟炸機·此後將陸續以多數的大編隊來襲擊我航空基地。第三·綜合外電及其他諸情報，敵方的就役空母並戰艦殘存尙多。</p>
<p>除這三點之外，敵方的出擊企圖亦甚堅決，所以不用說，今後敵人還要猛烈前來反攻。以波根維爾島，新幾內亞島為左右手的新不列顛島賴蒲爾之存在，是日本的戰略要點。同時，在敵方看來。又是在他們的進攻作戰上最大的障礙。他們在對日進攻作戰上，由於活用大量的航空兵力，在制空權下進行艙隊決戰，是眞正的且唯一的戰法。這看法大概不會錯吧！何况新不列顛有着實行這戰法最必要的條件。新不列穎有很多廣大而適於開　航空基地的地方。他們機展開所有的大量航空兵力，攻略此地。</p>
<p>新不列顛地位重要</p>
<p>大量航空兵力如其能夠在本在新幾內亞島威沃克，馬當方面的陸上部隊，其補充路綫亦有被截斷而孤立化之處。如此，敵人從新幾內亞進攻菲律賓，欲切斷日本和南方資源地帶的企圖，和從新幾尼亞方面直衝資源地帶的企圖，達到了第一階段的結果。</p>
<p>如此說來，新不列顛的存在，因為在戰略上極為重要，所以敵人當然用堅張的決心前來出擊。在這裏，任何犧牲在所不惜。且敵方擬製造一個攻略賴蒲爾的立脚點，遣兵在玻根維爾島登陸，直指新不列顛，意欲一鼓作氣來攻。可是現在遇到了一大暗礁。而且玻根維爾島上尙殘存着他們的登陸部隊，他們特意殘留於此，任其殲滅，而對我航空基地開始航空戰，耗費了很多的犧牲，這大作戰盡歸鳥有。美國與論對此犧牲多而無實效的舉動，猛加攻擊。這或許成為戰局韓機的導火綫，反引起日水轉取攻勢的機會。如其說人是因多量出血而要致死的，那麼他們就在想到處動手，即使自己也要大量出血，但叫我們更大量的出血，在自己在敵人的企圖，我們冷靜地觀察到敵人這種拚命的狀態，現在我們所使用的武器，似通不能使他們倒下。要之，敵人絕對不能就這樣拖延下去。將用更强大的兵力前來出擊。在對付這一着上，我們第一反而應該先在敵所最希望的　　爾基地上展開大航空兵力。這增產，補充的賣務。是直接有賴於我們的努力。第一棧的將士可以成為神兵，在第二綫的我們，不會不成為增產，補充的神兵。（翔譯自十一月十三日東京期日新聞）</p>

<h3>首都民衆昨舉行　歡迎鮑斯氏大會　汪主席親蒞會塲致歡迎詞</h3>
<p>南京十九日中央社電　東亞十億民族正緊密協力，齊向建設東亞解放束亞之大逍邁進之際，而於出席大東亞會議完畢後之印度臨時政府鮑斯主席。特專程來華，訪問我國。此不僅表示中印關係之緊密團結，更足顯示中印兩民族於此大東亞解放戰中巳有同心協力之決意，其意義至堪重視，舉國　野，對此靡不寄予热烈之期待，首都各界民眾特於十九日上上午十一時在靑年館舉行歡迎自由印度臨時政府爾斯主席大會，並恭請鮑斯主席蒞臨演講，到有黨員公務員靑少年團義勇警察各大中學校學生商民勞動服務隊黨政軍警學農工商各界民亲代表約萬餘人，中樞各院部及各機關長官到有江亢虎，陳璧君，溥侗，禇民誼，任接道，陳春　，陳君　，林柏生，周　庠，夏奇峰等，外賓方面日滿德各國駐華使館亦派代表參加。</p>
<p>汪主席致詞</p>
<p>南京十九日中央社電　首都民眾歡迎自由印度臨主席致歡迎詞如下：</p>
<p>我們今天得在這裏歡迎自由印度臨時政府主席鮑斯先生，實在歡喜無量。</p>
<p>我們廳到自由印度館時政府成立的消息，我們歡躍的心情，和辛亥那年德到中華民國臨時政府成立於南　的消息差不了多少，因爲中印兩大民族境過太相同了，感情也就一致，我們盼望中國有自由的一天，同時也盼望印度有自由的一天。</p>
<p>我們今天看到自由印度臨時政府的主席鮑斯先生，我們歡躍的心情，不是什麽可以比擬，如果要比擬的話，當我們聽到甘地先生被捕，和甘堆先生絕食消息，我們如何的憤激，如何的悲痛，便可知遒我們聽到鮑斯先生挺身出來領導自由印度臨時政府，我們是如何的歡喜如何的興奮。</p>
<p>說到這裹，我們深深感謝盟邦日本热烈的同情，和遠大的眼光。這次自由印度臨時政府的成立。是日本予以絕大的援助，並且對於其將來的發展，還要不斷的予以援助。道樣的爲正義爲人道爲大東亞共存共榮而出於　樣光明俊偉的舉動，凡屬人類，應常同聲感謝。</p>
<p>常常聽到人說「英國人是愛自由的」不錯，英國人是愛自由，英國人尤其愛吃人血的自由，他在印度所以施行侵略政策，無非要擴張其吃人血的自由，他在印度所以防制革命，縛束革命蕪人無微不至，無非要保持其吃人血的自由的權利。</p>
<p>事實擺在面前，一個英團拿播甘地先生及其同志監禁在獄中，一個日本授助鮑斯先生出來成立自由印度臨時政府，這個是順人心合天理，那個是反乎人心逆乎天理，不待言而自明了。</p>
<p>我如今問問渝方的舊時伙伴蔣介石先生，張溥泉，　季陶　先生，你們從前是不是和我們一樣看得印度革命和中國革命同樣的　切，你們是不是曾經為印度革命的志士和我們一同　過同情的淚，一同湧起熱血，要與被壓迫的民族共同奮鬥，可是如隨英美屠戶之後推及於自由萌芽之印度！</p>
<p>現在大東亞戰爭，節節勝利，大東亞共榮建設，由於大東亞會議，大東亞宣言已顯示出光明燦爛之前途，値茲自由印度臨時政府主席鮑斯先生蒞臨中國之際，我們中國民索得接近着印度民眾之偉大救星、眞乃爲印度慶，爲大東亞　，謹述數語，以丧歡泖　之热忱。</p>
<p>打倒英國霸權同情印度自由</p>
<p>中華民國　國父孫先生在民國六年所著中國存亡間題裏指出，若要重新創造一個合平正式的世界，首先要打倒大英帝國的霸權，若要打倒大英帝國的霸權，首先要做到中國和印度的獨立自主，所以的印也固是然東是亞印乃度至亞洲的自由，也即是世界的自由。</p>
<p>我們痛心得很，我們雖然有對於自由印度的同情心，可是我們現在還不」能如日木之能予自由印度以有力的援助。我們只有顆同情心，只有一顆热烈而跳躍着的同情心，我份望這同情心能夠鍛鍊起來，多少發出一點援助的力量。</p>

<p>斯丹埠十九日中央社電　印度孟買地方之餓一殍引起自殺者甚多，有私運貨物進入孟買者，即遭警察槍殺或被捕，於雙方衝突中，受傷者多名。英當局雖謂缺乏運輪工具，以致阻碍救濟物品之運輪，而賽馬及以馬作運輸之用者，全印均在進行。孟買救濟委員會秘嘗最近發表：謂十一月及十二月兩個月饑謹之狀况，猶更緊張，居民全賴進口之食品，以侯十二月之收獲，倘依過去之經騐，孟買仍　繼不獲得該項之進口食物，則該處將成無人之境城，因大多數之印人均將成餓殍矣。</p>

<h3>德精銳調赴前綫　擊破蘇鉗形戰術　柯洛斯頓區劇戰進行中</h3>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電　據海通社訊：蘇軍在東綫齊托密爾區域企圖突破德托軍林陣綫，遭受挫敗後，德回齊托密爾聶伯河套一綫之蘇軍側面，繼續增加壓力，德軍自南面向北反攻頗有進展。德軍發言人並不否認德軍以精銳預備隊在該處自戰，渠申示德軍司令部於防禦戰中，保留精銳之預備隊，僅於敵軍大規模進攻時調用，此項戰略頗為健全。蘇軍在柯洛斯頓方面以大軍進攻，刻在劇戰中，該處及齊托密爾之戰事係鉗形戰術性質，而齊托密爾之一鉗業已殘廢矣。戈美爾方面蘇軍對勒　　繼續使用壓力，　在劇戰中。斯摩倫斯克以西之蘇軍，於前日向奧爾　進攻德軍冒雨肉搏，在二十四小時內毀蘇軍坦克車十四輛，。蘇軍自尼維爾西南，以生力軍向東南及南面進攻，戰局無變化。聶伯河套方面蘇軍在尼普貝特羅夫斯克西南及克里伏洛格以北進攻，並無進展。兩日來蘇軍在東綫投失坦克車四五四輛。</p>
<h3>渝美空軍紀律蕩然　民衆怨憤益甚　屢發生美空軍失踪事件</h3>
<p>中央社滬訉　據最近由桂林歸抵上海之陳君談稱、駐逾英美空軍俸給之高，與一般誠有天壤之別，因此彼等得以極盡奢慾之能事，且彼等尚可由本國供給若干生活用品，者一旦金盡，將其出售，又可獲得多數金錢、因之美空軍生活之優裕，誠非」思料可及。且因　有最高權力與金錢關係，遂目空一切，傍若無人，動輒侵入民家，脅迫婦女，民眾怨恨，日見深刻。各少壯軍人及官吏等無不恨之刺骨，尤以一般民眾常乘當局未予注意之隊，對彼等採取報復行爲，致屢有美空軍兵員失踪事件發生。傳美空軍長官斯蒂維爾鑒於事態之嚴重、曾向蔣介石提出嚴重交涉，要求今後對美空軍倘有稍加侮辱者，應不問情節　重，一作處以死刑，渝方無法反抗，卒於最近頒發布告，現定仇視美空軍者，漑須以間諜或妨碍國　罪處以死刑。然民眾對美空軍之怨恨，非獨不見減低，並有益趨深刻之勢。</p>

<h3>唐納資盆地　十年內難復舊觀</h3>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電　據此間軍界人士稱：泰晤士報之報告謂，唐納資盆地全部被燬之損失程度，巳使蘇聯至少於十年內無法利用該處，此說顯已明示一切。架普魯基水問炸毀後，所埋之地雷，未被大水沖去，因地下水準繼續增高，巳沉沼水中。各打水站所需之電力，因發電廠被毁，巳告中斷。</p>

<h3>第一警局規定　戰時違警罰法　遵照國府頒布違警罰法辦理</h3>

<h3>日陸軍發言人談　緬甸戰事近况　英美無力發動反攻</h3>
<p>中央社釩　日陸軍報道部發首人，昨午在陸海外聯合報迸常會席上，發表在華緬國境之英美軍企圖進攻愴形，氏首謂，最近中日同盟後，隨有大東亞會議及印度臨時政府主席扛特拉鮑斯之訪華，此實爲世界歷史未有之偉大事實，在找人眼廉躍見，於茲足見東亞各民族巳打成一片，且巳建設一切新的希望，是我人之理想目的，不久即可實現？業巳尤滿新的信念，故我人對此巨大之意義，更需加之强訓。且同時如英美之在西南太平洋之反攻，及企圖會囘緬旬，以及在渝方之發動攻勢，均爲日軍從容擊破，故確信最後勝利，已毫無疑義。</p>
<p>美渝空軍損害綦重</p>
<p>發言人又述美在渝空軍，爲第十四航空隊，在今三月間所組織之，其目的乃爲作空襲日本土之舉，然經日在華之陸軍有力部隊，屢予渝方攻擊，彼輩損失　重，不能振作，至今巳成完全消減之象，而美國方面，猶擬設法補充，以圖　補在渝空軍之損害，雖冉增加，亦告徒然。而其補充情形，相當濃厚，曾有最新型之P五一型戰門機，在最近會空襲香港，經日本航空　隊密布强大火細，予以擊被使之無法進行，故日軍對敵軍任何最新型之武器，均不足畏　而從容擊祐，最近又據外國通訉，彼鹽猶擬加强力量，以組繳所謂美渝混成飛行隊，其目的不外爲增張今後力量，此美渝之混成飛行隊長，即前十四航空隊琴諾特所兼任。我人觀此情形，其表面以求合理之指揮渝空軍，實際乃堂握支配渝空軍，雖美口頭聲言爲統一指揮，實則充分暴露對渝之野心，今後渝空軍非特將被美在渝空軍之指揮，更以渝所需之物資，如機油材料等等，亦將爲混成飛行隊可獲得優先雚。</p>
<p>駐緬日軍節節勝利</p>
<p>再觀渝緬之總反攻，企圖奪囘糆甸，前會言一待雨季過後，即有作發動攻勢，當時聲勢兌兇，但　過相當時期，亦不過爾爾，而其陸海之聯合進攻，於雨季過後，初無積極行動，更無戰果可言，尤以印緬邊境之　動，均爲日軍隨時予以擊破，目前更無重大變化，最近日車爲先發制人計，在緬甸進攻，粉碎彼輩企圖，同時在緬日派遗軍，爲控制彼等行動，特先發制人迎攻滇省，攻擊渝派緬之連征軍陳緘部隊，自發動攻勢等，節節勝利，且將怒江各重要據點，完全佔領，並將殘兵予以掃瀉，日軍所得戰果頗大，而渝派緬之遠征軍已處漬減狀熊之中，故反軸心今後擬奪同緬旬之企圖，根本粉碎，此外英在印之遠征軍，奧慶萊克於上月發表演說，謂印緬情形毫無變化，惟須發動進攻，必須獲得後援始可，故在印緬情形，足以證明彼輩毫無進展。</p>
<p>倫敦承認反攻無力</p>
<p>最近又據偷敦路透電訉，對此次反攻公開聲明，已言絕對不可能，其理由約有二點：　無對日空襲根據地，　輩特巴登之發動有效攻勢，須有更大之準備，而結論並言日軍在華势力龐大，如要在華作根據地，須在中國浙江方面建立，並須將進緬公路開通，以强化渝方武備，使渝在浙江獲得基地，始能完成根據地之計劃。</p>
<p>發言人又十　蒙特巴頓之指概統一問題，曾在新德里先筏舉行二次會議，至今尚未　到最後階段，故此一問題之不決，更違談反攻及作戰。</p>
<p>後述日在華派遗軍自十月底起，在湖北湖南第六戰區發動作職，以呼應　南日軍之進攻，此在作戰上頗具意義，第六區方面進行頗爲順利，爲時不久，巳攻取渝方嘰略上要點頗多，計有南縣，安鄉、松滋、列家橋、枝扛、宜都、子良坪、新安、石門等之重要地點。渝方受此打擊，頗爲狼狽，且渝方此次作戰軍殲，因以前未曾受日軍之猛烈攻擊，故此次進攻、不經日軍一擊、即巳憤不成軍，表面上雖自鎮靜，但亦自知心　部已受攻擊。關於此次戰事，目前尚無具體詳細報告，深僧不久當有偉大戰果，在此點須予加以認織者，此次戰事爲確立束亞共榮圈建設東亞而戰，期以擊一阻碍建設東亞其榮顧之渝軍、亦可謂係發展大東亞戰爭。</p>

<h3>煤球供應未普遍　盼澈底改善　柴炭節節升騰殊堪注意</h3>
<p>本市煤球業同業公會，為普遍供售現貨煤球起見，乃於本月十六日起開始辦理零售商配給事宜，汔今巳屆五日，大部份零售商均巳分別領得『准講證』，向指定製造廠次第出貨應市，惟煤球供應市况，仍未轉作，市民無法向就近零售商購燃，同時市價參差不一，故全市居民一致殷盼主管當局予以尅日澈底改善，以安民生。惟市民因不易購得煤球，　榦購柴炭替代，以致柴炭市價日趨暴漲，較諸一個月前，上升三分之一有奇。際斯各常局甫在大規模抑平物價之時，獨柴炭售價反一苒高升，其中不無有人作宗，或圃積居奇。惟昨據熟諳榮炭市况者告稱，柴炭來滬並未中斷，目前僅因用途見增，但前途供應，決無匱乏之處，然市價之節節高升，乃係受投機者作祟所致，聞常局巳寄予密切注意。</p>
<h3>鮑斯訪華　意義深長　廣田課長發表談話</h3>
<p>中央社訉　日本大使館廣田情報課長，於昨午在陸海外聯合報道常會席上，就印臨時政府主席江特拉鮑斯此行訪華，特發表談話。</p>
<p>偉大歷史</p>
<p>廣田課長首謂：印臨時政府主席江特拉鮑斯此次參加大東亞會議後，途徑南京，專程訪華，向國府領袖交換意見，密切懇談，是以江氏對國府表示繫密協力外，且更理解對大東亞各民族之共同理想，本人於此特對江氏表示十二分之敬意。</p>
<p>關於印獨立運動自十九世紀以來，於今繼續展開，印臨時獨立政府之成立，爲前所未有，且爲大東亞共榮圈之一環，故其意義殊爲深長，按照政治觀點，在歷史上爲　時代之新紀元。此次大東亞各民族一致聯合於十一月六日發表共同宣言，挆用該日爲大東亞共同宣言之紀念日，在大東亞民族歷史上實爲永久傾得紀念且不能磨減之偉大紀念日。</p>
<p>奠定基礎</p>
<p>大東亞共同宣言，爲確保大東亞建締協定，其內容在中日條約第二條中明白規定，是大東亞各國在此宣言上，爲共同努力建設大東亞，且建設大東亞共榮圈乃各民族間深所祈頣者，故在歷史上言，大東亞各民族之階級，巳寄於十一爲六日該日爲出發點·亦可謂爲大東亞民族階級之基礎磬石巳奠定，惟建設之內容，則將待今後之努力而決定之。</p>
<p>關於建設綱領，舉凡成立五條，其中實現者同前共計二條，其餘三絛，一部份雖能予實現，大部份則須寄置於今後之建股，例如以第二條而言，該條規定大東亞各國相互尊重自主獨立，並確定總親和，在此內容而觀，其第一項之大東亞各國相互尊重獨立，是爲各國之相互約束。在印度方面，因印之獨立尚未完成，故決定於總親和，而在中國方面，則因中國國内戰爭狀態尚未中止，亦未能實現此第二項之規定。</p>
<p>世界進運</p>
<p>乃　其他各條一條之規定建設，以　　為基礎秩序，第三條之發揚文化，第四條之發展經濟，第五條之貢獻世界之進運，關於該點，廣田課長特加以說明，貢獻世界進運，集世界各國萬邦，廢隊人稳差別，以交流文化，開拓世界資源，以貢獻世界之進運，故該點亦須於今後之努力建設，爲逮到此偉大之目的，放大東亞十億民族，各國政府歡叙一　，彼此意見完全一致，異常密切。</p>
<p>在同一目標下，相互團結，爲歷史上得未曾有之盛舉，尤以此次印臨時玫府主席江特拉鮑斯之訪華，在大東亞共榮圈爲最重要之一員，中國與印度兩國緊密提携，從茲更爲密切，乃歷史上値得大書特嘗之一頁。</p>
<p>迥溯印獨立運動之歷史，印度因受暴英壓制下謀解放而鬥爭，印自得大東亞戰爭之良機，再舉獨立義旗，不伹在英壓制下獲得解放，且與大東亞自由各民族相聚一堂，掃脫制　世界之英美桎梏，爭取共同獨立，此實爲一新的階段，故印度此次獨立还動之內容全貌，與前略有不同。</p>
<p>擊滅英美</p>
<p>故印度目前之立塲，興非律濱之立塲，則相逈異，菲律賓歷年因受美國之壓制，諜斛放爲目標，故印菲兩國同慘受英灸兩國之際制，含辛茹苦多年：蓋英美之金回資本主義　政，以印菲兩國作爲壓　東亞民族之出發點，故印菲及東亞各民族，均應認識相互共同之命運，且印葬兩國亦以擊诚英美而與東亞各民族相結合。</p>
<p>江特拉鮑斯氏，在印獨立運動史上，向抱負顯著立傷，當在靑年時氏挺身努力印獨立運動爲印國民會議派主要幹部，曾在一九三七年一九三八年兩年中，被選連任議長，故扛氏爲國民會議派中最激進之人才，當時英國方面，對氏頗爲注意，曾將其逮捕入獄，嗣後氏出走印度，於歐戰發生後，在德柏林露面，今春氏赴東京，未幾又赴昭南烏，力主武力解放印度爲目標，展開獨立運動</p>
<p>按印度具有數千年之悠久歷史，且維持數千年來之文化，惜於最近三百年問，深受英壓制之痛苦，此次在江特拉鮑斯氏領導下奮鬥努力，爭取自主獨立，我人斷言，印巳在獨立完成之前夕，同時印臨時政府軍隊，擊破英國軍隊，以佔領英國領土，將爲期不遠，我人將拭目以待，而日本軍隊仍繼續授助印度，完成印度盡量努力以擊減英國而奮鬥，故印度擊破英美制霸世界之爲期巳不遠，不久當將爲之實現。</p>

<p>改正消費節約用煤</p>
<p>中央社訊頃據關係當局發表，最近有以煤斤缺乏，發現黑市，歸咎於大中聯煤號者，當局現正澈査其宜傳之來源，至煤斤供求狀態，關係當局憂處之可言。惟在決戰體制下，浪費物資在所不許，况煤斤係數百萬噸之大量物資，非有火車輪船等輪送機關負擔輸運不可，今番大戰，亦可稱為輸送戰爭，換言之，使輸送繼關減輕負擔，亦非節約消費不可。凡認為不必要或不急需者，或用代用品者，以及一切節約所餘部分中，節約下來，使大量改正消費方針，易於實施。</p>

<h3>Self-Expectation and Expectation of Others</h3>
<p>Submitting for Correction to the Propaganda Conference and Fellow Professionals</p>
<p>The Propaganda Department, in order to review national propaganda work and strengthen the wartime propaganda system, convened representatives from relevant agencies and organizations to hold the Second National Propaganda Conference, which opened today in the capital and will last for three days.</p>
<p>Recently, conferences have been quite frequent. Those with the Greater East Asia as their scope include the Greater East Asia Conference, the National Assembly, the New Assembly, the Youth Leaders Conference, and the Sports Conference, etc. Domestically, there have been the Police Conference of the Ministry of Interior, the Local Economic Liaison Conference of the Ministry of Industry, the Health Administration Conference of the Ministry of Health, and today's Propaganda Conference. The purpose of the conferences is to gather ideas and seek common ground, and to discuss concrete steps towards achieving common goals. Of course, these are all good signs of progress.</p>
<p>In various conferences at home and abroad, we have always contributed our humble opinions based on our observations. However, at today's Propaganda Conference, we feel particularly excited and, at the same time, alert. Because newspapers are a part of propaganda, the scope of discussion and the policies decided at the Propaganda Conference are directly related to newspapers. We are excited because the mission of the newspaper industry will become even more important; we are alert because the responsibility of the newspaper industry will feel increasingly arduous. Because the mission is important, it is necessary to clearly identify the goals and strive to complete them. Because the responsibility is arduous, it is necessary to overcome difficulties and bravely shoulder it. Our words today are not advice to others, but self-encouragement, so as to expect of oneself and to expect of others:</p>
<p>First, a propaganda campaign must have a clear objective. Behind the propaganda, there must be facts to support it. Only then will the propaganda be effective and achieve its goal. The so-called "facts," whether positive or negative, must be consistent with the content of the propaganda. For example, if politics are on track and the economy is rationalized, and the propaganda is supported by such facts, then it will be easier to gain public trust by righteously and vigorously exercising the power of propaganda.</p>
<p>Second, the skill of propaganda can only be seen in the comparison of time and space. Propaganda without factual support, even if skillfully applied, is still a waste of effort with little effect. Furthermore, good skill is not necessarily flattery or praise; on the contrary, indiscriminate praise is a clumsy propaganda technique. The key to skill lies in "appropriateness," in making it easy for the public to understand and trust what they see and hear. This is the success of skill in terms of time. Not only individuals trust it, but they also extend it to others, spreading it to each other quickly and widely. This is the success of skill in terms of space.</p>
<p>Third, the current Central News Agency is, in fact, the only institution for issuing news. In terms of personnel, organization, and equipment, it must be strengthened to be able to assume its responsibilities. From the newspaper's perspective, the greatest difficulties now are the "too few" and "too slow" domestic telegrams. "Too few" means that domestic news is sometimes unavailable, or even if the quantity is not small, the substance is still lacking. "Too slow" affects the hasty editing and publication of newspapers and delays their distribution. Telegraphic communication prioritizes speed above all else, and every minute and second must be fought for. The news agency should not delay the dispatch of certain telegrams if time permits. For example, if there is news from a conference in Nanjing in the morning, the Central News Agency should send a telegram to its branches, and the branches should forward it to the newspapers, which should, in principle, not exceed 4:00 PM at the latest, so that the evening papers in various places can publish it. This is not a demanding request from the newspapers, but a basic condition that the news agency should meet. However, based on our daily experiences, news from Nanjing in the morning often does not reach the Shanghai newspapers until around 2:00 AM, or even after 4:00 AM. By then, it is often lengthy and repetitive, making it difficult for the newspapers to edit in a relaxed manner due to time constraints, and thus inevitably leading to hasty omissions. Such a disconnect in the work between the news agency and the newspapers is especially detrimental to the progress of the newspaper industry and the effectiveness of propaganda, especially when the Central News Agency is the sole source of news. We hope that the propaganda authorities will first adjust the personnel of the Central News Agency, increase salaries, and assign responsibilities. Secondly, they should find ways to enrich the equipment and reasonably strengthen the organization. We dare say that expecting and urging the progress of the newspaper industry and the strengthening of propaganda while the communication mechanism and the newspaper industry are so disconnected in their work is simply paying lip service. On the one hand, we are focusing on the progress of the entire newspaper industry and, of course, do not want to shirk responsibility. From the perspective of the newspapers, we should do our best to liaise with the news agency and strive to improve our own work.</p>
<p>Chairman Wang [Jingwei] promulgated twelve "Instructions for Propaganda Workers" at the First National Propaganda Conference on June 1, 1941, among which the ninth item says "Speak honestly and take responsibility." This is indeed the motto of propaganda workers. The three points we have provided above contain the important meaning of this item. Today, we solemnly propose them again, wishing to expect them of ourselves and of the representatives and fellow professionals at the conference.</p>
<h3>48 Enemy Planes Invading Bougainville Island Shot Down:  Japanese Air Force Displays Power in South Pacific</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a certain Japanese base in the South Pacific: On the 17th, over a hundred enemy planes attacked Buka Island, north of Bougainville Island. The Japanese naval air force immediately engaged them, shooting down 48 enemy planes, with very light damage to the Japanese side.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a certain Japanese base in the South Pacific: On the 18th, three enemy B-24 type planes attacked the Gilbert Islands. The Japanese naval air force engaged them, shooting down two enemy planes, with no damage to the Japanese side.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a certain Japanese base in the South Pacific: On the night of the 17th to the early morning of the 18th, the Japanese naval air force in the area bombed a position on Mono Island, causing a large fire. All Japanese planes returned safely to base.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a certain Japanese base in the South Pacific: On the 17th and 18th, the Japanese naval air force repeatedly attacked the port near Torokina and the small island at the mouth of the Torokina River, destroying enemy land facilities and sinking three large enemy motorboats. All Japanese planes returned safely.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 19th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Washington: The US government remains silent about the significant damage suffered by the US fleet in the naval and air battles off Bougainville Island. On the 18th, the US Navy finally made its first announcement, stating that the US cruiser "Northampton" was recently lost in the battle of Bougainville. This means that the US Navy has lost over eighty ships in the Bougainville area, but is now only admitting the loss of one cruiser, continuing its usual tactic of releasing information piecemeal. The cruiser "Northampton" is of the same type as the cruisers "Augusta," "Houston," and "Chicago," which were previously sunk by the Japanese Navy. It is 150 tons and was completed in 1929.</p>
<h3>Communist Suppression Campaign Launched in the Guangzhou-Kowloon and Pearl River Areas:  Japanese and Chinese Armies Cooperate in Combat</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a certain Japanese base on the South China front, the communist suppression campaign launched by the Japanese army along the [Guangzhou-Kowloon] railway has now achieved its objective. The elite Japanese troops have now launched the third phase of operations, launching a new communist suppression campaign against the communist bandit troops between the railway and the Pearl River since the 16th. This area, centered on Bao'an County, is the communist area in South China.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 19th (Central News Agency) - Recently, the Japanese army launched an operation to suppress the communist bandits in the area between the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and the Pearl River. Our Peacebuilding Army also participated in the operation. Under the banner of the Sino-Japanese alliance, the two armies launched a joint operation on the South China front. A certain commander of the Japanese army in South China held a combat meeting in Humen on the 16th with Generals Xu Ting, commander of the 30th Division of our army, and Luo Xiuli, commander of the 6th Army, to decide on a strategy to suppress the communist bandits. After the meeting, Commander Xu stated that our army has received assistance and guidance from the Japanese army since it was stationed in the area, and has successfully accomplished its mission. This time, in the operation along the Guangzhou-Kowloon line, we have cooperated with the Japanese army and have achieved considerable results. We will do our best to complete the tasks assigned to us, he said.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Captures Daheidu in Western Yunnan</p>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Chongqing, the Chongqing Military Council announced on the 18th that the Japanese army in the west bank of the Nujiang River in western Yunnan, after starting operations in Pinggao Street, southeast of Longling, had occupied Daheidu to the east of that place on the 16th.</p>

<h3>Victory at Bougainville Island and Future Trends in the War Situation</h3>
<p>The United States Attempts to Conduct a Fleet Decisive Battle</p>
<p>Since landing at Cape Torokina on Bougainville Island, the enemy's counterattack has been extremely fierce. Not only Bougainville Island, but also New Britain Island, they want to capture at once. This attack is indeed unprecedented. The Japanese naval air force and surface ships that prevented this attack will be forever remembered. We express our infinite gratitude for this major victory since Pearl Harbor. At the same time, we dare not be complacent, because the enemy is truly formidable. This victory is indeed great, but now, as we calmly observe the situation caused by this battle, we cannot simply revel in the dream of victory. In the South Pacific war situation, it is worth noting: First, this battle occurred because of the enemy's attack, and the enemy suffered great damage. Second, the enemy's base air force is still powerful today, possessing many fighters and bombers. In the future, they will continue to attack our air bases with large formations. Third, based on foreign dispatches and other intelligence, there are still many surviving enemy aircraft carriers and battleships in service.</p>
<p>In addition to these three points, the enemy's attack plans are also very firm, so it goes without saying that the enemy will continue to launch fierce counterattacks. The existence of Rabaul on New Britain Island, with Bougainville Island and New Guinea as its left and right hands, is a strategic key point for Japan. At the same time, in the eyes of the enemy, it is the biggest obstacle to their offensive operations. In their offensive operations against Japan, the true and only way is to utilize a large number of air forces to conduct a decisive fleet battle under air supremacy. This view is probably correct! Moreover, New Britain has the most necessary conditions for implementing this tactic. New Britain has many large areas suitable for opening up air bases. They deploy all their massive air power to conquer this place.</p>
<p>The Importance of New Britain's Position</p>
<p>If massive air power can isolate the land units of the New Guinea Island, Wewak, and Madang, the supply routes of the New Guinea Island, Wewak, and Madang, which were originally there, can also be cut off. In this way, the enemy's attempt to advance from New Guinea to the Philippines and cut off Japan's and the Southern resource zone, and the attempt to attack the resource zone directly from New Guinea, have reached the first stage of results.</p>
<p>That being the case, the existence of New Britain is strategically important, so the enemy will naturally launch an attack with unwavering determination. Here, no sacrifice will be spared. The enemy intends to create a foothold for conquering Rabaul, sending troops to land on Bougainville Island, directly targeting New Britain, intending to attack in one fell swoop. But now they have encountered a major reef. Moreover, their landing forces are still remaining on Bougainville Island. They deliberately remain here, letting it be annihilated, and start an air war against our air base, spending a lot of sacrifices, this big operation is all gone in vain. The American argument strongly attacks this action of great sacrifice but no practical effect. This may become the fuse of the war situation, on the contrary causing Japan to take the offensive opportunity to gain. If people are going to die because of a lot of bleeding, then they will start everywhere even if they have to bleed a lot themselves, but let us bleed even more. We calmly observe this desperate state of the enemy, now the weapons we are using seem to fail to make them fall. In short, the enemy absolutely cannot delay like this, and will use even more powerful forces to attack. To deal with this, we should instead first expand the large air force at the [Rabaul] base that the enemy most hopes for. This increase in production and supply is directly dependent on our efforts. The soldiers of the First line can become divine soldiers, and we on the Second line will not fail to become divine soldiers of increased production and supply.

<h3>Capital Citizens Hold a Grand Meeting Yesterday to Welcome Mr. Bose: Chairman Wang [Jingwei] Personally Attends the Meeting and Delivers a Welcome Speech</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) - As the billion people of East Asia are closely cooperating and advancing towards the great goal of building and liberating East Asia, Chairman Bose of the Provisional Government of India, after attending the Greater East Asia Conference, made a special trip to China to visit our country. This not only demonstrates the close unity of Sino-Indian relations, but also shows that the two nations of China and India have the determination to cooperate in this great war of liberation in East Asia. The significance of this is extremely important, and the whole country is full of fervent expectations. People from all walks of life in the capital held a grand meeting at the Youth Hall at 11:00 AM on the 19th to welcome Chairman Bose of the Provisional Government of Free India, and respectfully invited Chairman Bose to give a speech. More than 10,000 people attended, including party members, civil servants, youth corps, volunteer police, students from major middle schools, business people, labor service teams, and representatives from all walks of life in the party, government, military, police, academic, agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors. Senior officials from the central government's departments and agencies who attended included Jiang Kanghu, Chen Bijun, Pu Dong, Chu Minyi, Ren Yuetao, Chen Chunpu, Chen Junpu, Lin Bosheng, Zhou Zixiang, and Xia Qifeng. On the foreign guest side, representatives from the embassies of Japan, Manchukuo, and Germany in China also attended.</p>
<p>Chairman Wang [Jingwei]'s Speech</p>
<p>Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) - The capital's citizens welcomed the following welcome speech by the chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India:</p>
<p>We are extremely happy to be able to welcome Mr. Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, here today.</p>
<p>When we heard the news of the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India, our joyful mood was not much different from when we heard the news that the Provisional Government of the Republic of China was established in Nanjing in the year of Xinhai [1911]. Because the circumstances of the two major nations of China and India are too similar, our feelings are also consistent. We hope that China will have a day of freedom, and at the same time, we also hope that India will have a day of freedom.</p>
<p>Today, seeing Mr. Bose, the chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, our joyful mood cannot be compared to anything. If we were to compare it, when we heard the news that Mr. Gandhi was arrested and that Mr. Gandhi was on a hunger strike, how angry and sad we were, then we would know how happy and excited we were when we heard that Mr. Bose stood up to lead the Provisional Government of Free India.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, we deeply thank our ally Japan for its fervent sympathy and great vision. The establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India this time was given great assistance by Japan, and it will continue to provide assistance for its future development. For justice, for humanity, and for the common prosperity of Greater East Asia, such a bright and outstanding act should be constantly thanked by all mankind.</p>
<p>We often hear people say that "the British love freedom." That's right, the British love freedom, especially the freedom to eat human blood. The reason why they implement a policy of aggression in India is nothing more than to expand their freedom to eat human blood. The reason why they prevent revolution in India and bind revolutionary people in every possible way is nothing more than to maintain their right to eat human blood.</p>
<p>The facts are in front of us. One British person imprisoned Mr. Gandhi and his comrades in prison. One Japanese person assisted Mr. Bose in establishing the Provisional Government of Free India. This is in accordance with the will of the people and the principles of heaven, while the other is against the will of the people and the principles of heaven. This is self-evident.</p>
<p>Now I ask Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, Mr. Zhang Puquan, and Mr. Dai Jitao, old partners from the Chongqing side, did you not used to see the Indian revolution and the Chinese revolution as equally important as we did? Did you not once shed tears of sympathy and surge with enthusiasm together with us for the revolutionary heroes of India, wanting to fight alongside the oppressed nations? But how can you follow the English and American butchers and extend this to India, where the sprouts of freedom are emerging!</p>
<p>Now, the Greater East Asia War is winning victory after victory, and the construction of Greater East Asia is showing a bright and brilliant future thanks to the Greater East Asia Conference and the Greater East Asia Declaration. As Chairman Bose of the Provisional Government of Free India comes to China, we, the Chinese people, have the opportunity to be close to the great savior of the Indian people. This is truly a celebration for India and a celebration for Greater East Asia. I would like to say a few words to express our warm enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Down with British Hegemony, Sympathy for Indian Freedom</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the Republic of China, pointed out in his book "The Question of China's Survival" in 1917 that if we want to recreate a peaceful and formal world, we must first overthrow the hegemony of the British Empire. If we want to overthrow the hegemony of the British Empire, we must first achieve the independence and autonomy of China and India. Therefore, the India of independent is the freedom of Asia.</p>
<p>We are very heartbroken that although we have sympathy for Free India, we are still unable to provide strong assistance to Free India as Japan can. We only have a heart of sympathy, only a heart of enthusiasm and throbbing, I hope that this heart of sympathy can be tempered, and we can provide a little help.</p>

<h3>Starving People Fill the Streets of Mumbai, India Due to British Misrule</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 19th (Central News Agency) - The starvation of people in Mumbai, India has led to many suicides. Those who privately transport goods into Mumbai are shot or arrested by the police, and many people are injured in the clashes between the two sides. Although the British authorities claim that the lack of transportation tools has hindered the transportation of relief supplies, horse racing and the use of horses for transportation are still ongoing throughout India. The secretary of the Mumbai Relief Committee recently announced that the famine situation in November and December will be even more tense, and residents are entirely dependent on imported food to wait for the harvest in December. If past experience is followed, Mumbai will still not be able to obtain the imported food, and the place will become a deserted city, because most of the Indians will starve to death.</p>

<p>Full Text of Declaration Elucidates Mission</p>
<p>News representatives and comrades from various regions of Greater East Asia gather here to discuss the news mission of completing the Greater East Asia War and contributing to the construction of Greater East Asia. Looking back, Asia has groaned under the tyranny of the enemies, Britain and the United States, for hundreds of years, subjected to their propaganda plots and rampant behavior, and their economic exploitation. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War to realize the Great Way of universal co-prosperity, the heroic operations of the Japanese Army and Navy, combined with the great belief of the one billion people of Greater East Asia that "Asia is One," have achieved unprecedented great victories. As a result, the political and economic shackles of Britain and the United States have been cut off, and the agencies for plotting and propaganda have been completely crushed. Asia has been restored as Asia for Asians, and all ideological warfare functions have been completely restored to the natural system of Asia. Although the stubborn counterattacks of Britain and the United States and their cunning propaganda plots cannot be ignored, our determination to complete the Great East Asia War and build Greater East Asia is even stronger. At this time, Germany and its allied groups in Europe are rising up resolutely with the same ideals as us, and are jointly fighting to destroy the ambitions of our enemies, Britain and the United States, under the banner of building a new world order. We express our deepest respect for their wise strategies and courageous battles. The representatives of the Greater East Asian countries gathered in Tokyo and announced to China and foreign countries the five major principles of East Asian co-existence and co-prosperity, independent autonomy, promoting East Asian culture, economic cooperation and prosperity, and contributing to the progress of the world. This is truly the embodiment of the spirit of Great Asia. Moreover, in order to establish complete world peace, and to thoroughly elucidate and clarify this great charter, the significance is immense. The responsibility borne by us journalists, we hold fast to the official media front, establish ideological warfare, and strive to work together with all our strength to defeat the fraudulent tactics and plots of Britain and the United States, to achieve the revitalization of Asia, and to accomplish the great mission of establishing world peace. This is solemnly declared.</p>

<h3>German Elite Units Transferred to the Front Lines: Breaking the Soviet Pincer Tactics; Fierce Battles Underway in the Korosten Area</h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency): According to the Datong News Agency: After the Soviet forces in the Zhytomyr area on the Eastern Front attempted to break through the German defense line and were defeated, the German forces continued to increase pressure on the flanks of the Soviet forces in the Zhytomyr-Dnieper River loop, and the German counterattack from the south to the north made considerable progress. A German spokesman did not deny that the German army was fighting with elite reserves in that area, and he stated that the German command retained elite reserves in the defensive battle, and only mobilized them when the enemy launched a large-scale attack. This strategy is quite sound. The Soviet army is attacking with large forces in the Korosten area, and is currently engaged in fierce battles. The battles in that area and Zhytomyr are pincer tactics in nature, and one pincer of Zhytomyr has already been crippled. In the Gomel area, the Soviet army continues to exert pressure on [city name unclear], and is engaged in fierce battles. The Soviet army west of Smolensk launched an attack on [city name unclear] the day before yesterday. German troops engaged in hand-to-hand combat in the rain, destroying 14 Soviet tanks in 24 hours. The Soviet army is attacking from the southwest of Nevel, with fresh troops advancing southeast and south, and the battle situation has not changed. In the Dnieper River loop, the Soviet army attacked southwest of Dnepropetrovsk and north of Krivoy Rog, but made no progress. In the past two days, the Soviet army has lost 454 tanks on the Eastern Front.</p>
<h3>Chongqing-U.S. Air Force Discipline Nonexistent: Public Resentment Increasing: U.S. Air Force Personnel Disappearances Occurring Frequently</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai: According to Mr. Chen, who recently returned to Shanghai from Guilin, the salaries of the British and American air forces stationed in Chongqing are vastly different from those of ordinary people, so they can indulge in extravagance to the extreme. Moreover, they can also be supplied with some daily necessities from their own country, and once their money runs out, they can sell them and get more money. Therefore, the comfortable life of the U.S. Air Force is truly beyond imagination. Moreover, because they have the highest power and money, they look down on everyone and act as if no one is there. They often break into people's homes and coerce women. Public resentment is becoming increasingly deep. All young military officers and officials hate them to the bone. In particular, ordinary people often take retaliatory actions against them when the authorities do not pay attention, resulting in frequent disappearances of U.S. Air Force personnel. It is said that the U.S. Air Force Commander Stilwell, in view of the seriousness of the situation, made a serious representation to Chiang Kai-shek, demanding that anyone who insults the U.S. Air Force in the future should be sentenced to death regardless of the circumstances. Chongqing was unable to resist, and finally issued a notice recently, stipulating that those who are hostile to the U.S. Air Force must be sentenced to death for espionage or obstructing national [unclear]. However, the public's resentment towards the U.S. Air Force has not only not decreased, but has become increasingly deep.</p>
<h3>Military Affairs Commission Establishes: North China Committee</h3>
<p>Beiping, 19th (Central News Agency): Lieutenant General Hu Yukun, the National Government Military Affairs Commission's North China Committee member, made a statement on the 18th, the gist of which is as follows: In order to adapt to the current situation and to command the National Army in North China, the National Government has decided to establish a resident committee in North China and appoint me to this position. In the future, I will follow the instructions of Chairman Wang and adjust the National Army in North China and supply food, ammunition, and other matters.</p>
<h3>Donets Basin: Difficult to Restore Original Appearance Within Ten Years</h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency): According to military sources here: The Times' report that the extent of the damage in the Donets Basin has made it impossible for the Soviet Union to use the area for at least ten years clearly shows everything. After the dam on the [river name unclear] was destroyed, the landmines buried were not washed away by the flood, because the groundwater level continued to rise and had sunk into the swamp. The power required by the pumping stations has been interrupted due to the destruction of the power plant.</p>
<h3>German War Spending in the First Four Years: Exceeding 360 Billion Marks</h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency): According to the Datong News Agency: Germany's wartime expenditures in the first four years of the war totaled 367,000,000,000 marks, of which 124,000,000,000 marks were from tax revenue, 193,000,000,000 marks were from loans, about 50,000,000,000 marks were from special income, and about 75,000,000,000 marks were spent on the people, that is, on the families and relatives of the soldiers on the front lines. The actual war expenditure was about 292,000,000,000 marks.</p>

<h3>First Police Precinct Stipulates: Wartime Violation Penalties: Handled in Accordance with the Violation Penalty Law Promulgated by the National Government</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The First Police Precinct of this city has handled the Violation Penalty Law in accordance with the Violation Penalty Law promulgated by the National Government. It has also formulated general regulations for wartime sentencing of police penalties, which have been announced and implemented. The method is excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>Wartime Violation Penalty Measures</p>
<p>The provisions of this method shall apply to fines imposed in wartime in accordance with the current Violation Penalty Law: The maximum amount of fines specified in each article of the Violation Penalty Law shall be increased fivefold, and the minimum amount shall be one yuan or more. The conversion standard for commuting detention specified in Article 15 of the Violation Penalty Law shall be one to three yuan per day. The conversion standard for commuting detention in the preceding paragraph shall still be one yuan per day if the amount of the fine imposed is less than the original amount stipulated in the Violation Penalty Law. If the total amount of the fine is converted to a number of days exceeding fifteen days, the total amount of the fine shall be proportional to the number of days of fifteen days. The remaining amount of less than one day shall not be counted. The provisions of the Violation Penalty Law regarding fines that are not inconsistent with this method shall still apply. This method shall be implemented from the date of promulgation. This method shall be suspended by order when the state of war ends.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Spokesman Talks About: Recent Developments in the Burma Campaign: Britain and the United States are Unable to Launch a Counterattack</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The spokesman for the Japanese Army Press Department, at the meeting of the United Overseas Chinese Newspaper Association yesterday afternoon, spoke about the attempts of the British and American troops in the Chinese-Burmese border area to launch an offensive. He first stated that, recently, after the Chinese-Japanese alliance, followed by the Greater East Asia Conference and the visit of Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Indian Provisional Government, this is truly a great and unprecedented fact in world history. It is clear to us that the various ethnic groups in East Asia have united as one, and have established new hope for everything. Our ideal goals will soon be realized? We have already felt a new belief, so we need to strengthen this great significance. At the same time, the counterattacks of Britain and the United States in the Southwest Pacific, their attempts to retake Burma, and their offensives launched in Chongqing have all been calmly defeated by the Japanese army, so we are convinced that the final victory is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>Severe Damage to Chongqing-U.S. Air Force</p>
<p>The spokesman also stated that the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing is the Fourteenth Air Force, which was organized in March of this year, and its purpose was to launch air raids on Japan. However, after the powerful units of the Japanese Army in China repeatedly attacked Chongqing, they suffered heavy losses and could not recover. To this day, it has completely disappeared. Although the United States plans to find ways to replenish it in order to make up for the damage to the Air Force in Chongqing, even if it increases, it will be in vain. Moreover, its replenishment situation is quite strong. The latest P-51 fighter plane recently raided Hong Kong, but was densely covered by powerful fire by the Japanese Air Force and was shot down, making it unable to proceed. Therefore, the Japanese army is not afraid of any of the enemy's latest weapons, and can calmly shoot them down. Recently, according to foreign communications, they are still planning to strengthen their forces to organize the so-called U.S.-Chongqing Mixed Flying Team. The purpose is nothing more than to increase their strength in the future. The commander of this U.S.-Chongqing mixed flying team is Qin Nuote, the former commander of the Fourteenth Air Force. When we observe this situation, it seems reasonable on the surface to seek command of the Chongqing Air Force, but in reality, it is to grasp the command and control of the Chongqing Air Force. Although the United States verbally claims to unify the command, it fully exposes its ambitions toward Chongqing. In the future, not only will the Chongqing Air Force be under the command of the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing, but also the supplies needed by Chongqing, such as engine oil, materials, etc., will be given priority by the mixed flying team.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops in Burma Winning Victories</p>
<p>Looking at the overall counter-offensive in Chongqing and Burma, in an attempt to retake Burma, it was previously said that as soon as the rainy season was over, an offensive would be launched. At that time, the momentum was fierce, but after a considerable period of time, it was nothing more than that. However, its joint land and sea offensive, after the rainy season, had no positive action and no results to speak of. Especially the [unclear] movements on the Indian-Burmese border were promptly defeated by the Japanese army. There are no major changes at present. Recently, in order to take the initiative, the Japanese army launched an offensive in Burma to crush their attempts. At the same time, in order to control their actions, the Japanese dispatch army in Burma took the initiative to attack Yunnan Province, attacking the Chongqing-sent Burma expeditionary force, Chen [unclear] troops. Since launching the offensive, they have won victories and completely occupied the important strongholds of the Nujiang River, and have wiped out the remnants of the troops. The Japanese army has gained considerable results, and the Chongqing-sent Burma expeditionary force is in a state of reduction. Therefore, the Axis Powers' attempt to retake Burma in the future has been completely crushed. In addition, the British expeditionary force in India, [name unclear], gave a speech last month, saying that the situation in India and Burma has not changed, but in order to launch an offensive, they must obtain rear support. Therefore, the situation in India and Burma is sufficient to prove that they have made no progress.</p>
<p>London Admits Counterattack is Weak</p>
<p>Recently, according to a Reuters report from London, they openly declared that this counterattack is absolutely impossible. The reasons are approximately two points: 1. No air raid base against Japan; 2. [Name unclear]'s launch of an effective offensive requires greater preparation. The conclusion is that the Japanese army in China has a large force. If you want to establish a base in China, you must establish it in Zhejiang, China, and you must open up the road to Burma to strengthen Chongqing's armament so that Chongqing can obtain a base in Zhejiang before the base plan can be completed.</p>
<p>The spokesman also pointed out that [Name unclear]'s general unification problem was held twice at the first meeting in New Delhi, and has not yet reached the final stage. Therefore, the undecided nature of this problem makes it even harder to talk about counterattacks and operations.</p>
<p>Later, it was stated that the Japanese dispatch army in China has been launching offensives in the sixth theater of Hubei and Hunan since the end of October in order to respond to the offensive of the [unclear] Japanese army. This is very meaningful in terms of combat. The progress on the sixth theater is progressing smoothly. Soon, many of Chongqing's strategic key points were captured, including important locations such as Nanxian, Anxiang, Songzi, Liejiaqiao, Zhijiang, Yidu, Ziliangping, Xin'an, and Shimen. Chongqing was quite embarrassed by this blow, and the Chongqing army was wiped out in this battle because it had never been subjected to a fierce attack by the Japanese army before. Therefore, this attack disintegrated the army without a single blow from the Japanese army. Although it is outwardly calm, it also knows that its heart has been attacked. Regarding this battle, there is no specific and detailed report at present. I deeply hope that there will be great results soon. On this point, it must be recognized that this battle is fought to establish the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere and to strike a blow to the Chongqing army that is hindering the construction of the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere, which can also be said to be the development of the Greater East Asia War.</p>

<h3>Coal Briquette Supply Not Widespread, Hope for Thorough Improvement, Rising Firewood and Charcoal Prices Deserve Attention</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Coal Briquette Industry Association, in order to widely supply spot coal briquettes, began handling the distribution of retailers starting from the 16th of this month. It has been five days since then. Most retailers have already obtained "permit certificates" and are successively taking delivery from designated manufacturers to meet market demand. However, the supply situation of coal briquettes has not yet improved. Citizens are unable to purchase fuel from nearby retailers, and the market prices vary greatly. Therefore, all residents of the city sincerely hope that the competent authorities will thoroughly improve the situation as soon as possible to stabilize people's livelihoods. However, because citizens cannot easily purchase coal briquettes, they have switched to purchasing firewood and charcoal as alternatives, resulting in a sharp rise in the market prices of firewood and charcoal, exceeding one-third compared to a month ago. At a time when various administrations are making large-scale efforts to suppress commodity prices, the selling price of firewood and charcoal alone is rising sharply, indicating that some people are speculating or hoarding goods. However, according to those familiar with the Rong charcoal market, the supply of firewood and charcoal to Shanghai has not been interrupted. Currently, it is only due to increased usage, but there will be no shortage of supply in the future. The continuous rise in market prices is caused by speculators. It is reported that the authorities have paid close attention to this matter.</p>
<h3>Bauss' Visit to China - Profound Significance, Section Chief Hirota Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch - Mr. Hirota, the Information Section Chief of the Japanese Embassy, delivered a speech yesterday afternoon at the Overseas United News Conference regarding the visit of Mr. Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, to China.</p>
<p>Great History</p>
<p>Section Chief Hirota first stated: Chairman Chandra Bose of the Provisional Government of India is visiting Nanjing after attending the Greater East Asia Conference for the express purpose of exchanging opinions and having close discussions with the leaders of the National Government. This shows Mr. Bose's close cooperation with the National Government and a deeper understanding of the common ideals of the various nations of Greater East Asia. I would like to express my utmost respect to Mr. Bose here.</p>
<p>Regarding the Indian independence movement, which has been ongoing since the 19th century, the establishment of the Provisional Government of India is unprecedented and is a part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, so its significance is particularly profound. From a political point of view, it is a new era in history. The unified declaration of the Greater East Asian nations on November 6th, adopting that day as the memorial day for the Greater East Asia Common Declaration, is truly a great memorial day in the history of the Greater East Asian nations that will forever be remembered and cannot be erased.</p>
<p>Laying the Foundation</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia Common Declaration is to ensure the establishment of the Greater East Asia Treaty, the content of which is clearly stipulated in Article 2 of the Sino-Japanese Treaty. The countries of Greater East Asia are making a joint effort to build Greater East Asia based on this declaration, and the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is deeply desired by all nations. Therefore, historically speaking, the Greater East Asian nations have regarded November 6th as a starting point, and it can also be said that the cornerstone of the Greater East Asian nations has been laid. However, the content of the construction will be determined by future efforts.</p>
<p>Regarding the construction program, there are five articles in total, and two have already been realized. A portion of the remaining three articles may be realized, but the majority must be placed in future construction. For example, regarding the second article, which stipulates that Greater East Asian countries respect each other's independence and autonomy and establish total amity, the first item, that Greater East Asian countries respect each other's independence, is a mutual restraint among the countries. In the case of India, since India's independence has not yet been completed, it has been decided to establish total amity. In the case of China, since the state of civil war within China has not yet ended, it has not been possible to realize this second item.</p>
<p>World Progress</p>
<p>Regarding the regulations of the other articles, construction is based on order, the third article is to promote culture, the fourth article is to develop the economy, and the fifth article is to contribute to the progress of the world. Section Chief Hirota specifically explained that contributing to the progress of the world means gathering all countries and nations in the world, abolishing human prejudice, exchanging cultures, and developing world resources to contribute to the progress of the world. Therefore, this point also requires future efforts in construction. To achieve this great goal, the governments of the ten billion people of Greater East Asia are enthusiastically gathered together, and their opinions are completely consistent and extremely close.</p>
<p>Uniting with each other under the same goal is an unprecedented grand event in history. In particular, the visit of Chairman Chandra Bose of the Provisional Government of India is the most important member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The close cooperation between China and India will become even closer from now on, which is a page in history worth writing about in detail.</p>
<p>Looking back at the history of the Indian independence movement, India has been struggling for liberation under the oppression of violent Britain. India seized the opportunity of the Greater East Asia War to raise the banner of independence again. Not only did it gain liberation from British oppression, but it also gathered with the free nations of Greater East Asia, sweeping away the shackles of British and American dominance over the world and striving for common independence. This is truly a new stage. Therefore, the overall content of India's independence movement this time is slightly different from before.</p>
<p>Destroying Britain and America</p>
<p>Therefore, India's current position is very different from that of the Philippines. The Philippines has been aiming for liberation because of the oppression of the United States over the years. Therefore, both India and the Philippines have suffered miserably under the control of Britain and the United States for many years. The gold-backed capitalism of Britain and America took India and the Philippines as the starting point for oppressing the nations of East Asia. Therefore, India, the Philippines, and the nations of East Asia should all recognize their common destiny, and both India and the Philippines should unite with the nations of East Asia to destroy Britain and America.</p>
<p>Mr. Chandra Bose has always held a prominent position in the history of the Indian independence movement. When he was young, he stepped forward and worked hard for the Indian independence movement as a major cadre of the Indian National Congress. He was elected and re-elected as Chairman for two years in 1937 and 1938. Therefore, Mr. Bose is the most radical talent in the National Congress. At that time, the British side paid close attention to him and arrested him and put him in prison. Afterwards, Mr. Bose left India and appeared in Berlin, Germany, after the outbreak of the European War. This spring, he went to Tokyo, and soon went to Shonan U, advocating the goal of liberating India by force and launching an independence movement.</p>
<p>India has a long history of thousands of years and has maintained its culture for thousands of years. Unfortunately, in the last three hundred years, it has suffered deeply from British oppression. This time, under the leadership of Mr. Chandra Bose, it is struggling to achieve autonomy and independence. We assert that India is on the eve of completing its independence. At the same time, the troops of the Provisional Government of India will defeat the British army and occupy British territory, which will not be far off. We will wait and see. The Japanese army will continue to assist India in completing India's efforts to reduce Britain and fight. Therefore, the destruction of Britain and America's domination of the world is not far off and will soon be realized.</p>
<h3>All City Company Employees to Undergo Joint Training</h3>
<p>Mr. Kiyoshi Tomono, Director of the Secretariat of the Central China Industrial Harmony Federation, stated that the employees of the 121 companies, etc., trained in the past were all Sino-Japanese joint ventures, factories, foreign firms, stores, etc. In order to expand the scope, the employees of all companies, stores, and factories operated by Chinese in Shanghai will also be included in the training. He is currently in contact with the Ministry of Social Welfare to discuss the methods, and it is planned that each company will send two senior employees each month to the Yokohama Bridge Youth Center on North Sichuan Road for training. It is also reported that the Federation Secretariat will begin the fifth session of the Chinese training seminar on November 23, with a duration of five days. Women serving in various companies will also be summoned for training. The training captain will still be Mr. Hu Yizang, Counselor of the Central China Railway and President of the Railway College, and two graduates from the fourth session will be selected to assist in everything.</p>
<p>Correcting Coal Consumption Savings</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that according to the authorities concerned, recently, the lack of coal and the discovery of the black market were attributed to the Great China United Coal Company. The authorities are currently thoroughly investigating the source of its propaganda. As for the supply and demand of coal, the authorities are concerned about the situation. However, under the wartime system, wasting materials is not allowed. Moreover, coal is a massive material of millions of tons, which cannot be transported without the burden of transportation agencies such as trains and ships. The current war can also be called a transportation war. In other words, it is imperative to reduce the burden on transportation agencies and save on consumption. Those that are deemed unnecessary or not urgently needed, or those that use substitutes, as well as all savings, should be saved down and a large amount of reformed consumption guidelines should be easily implemented.</p>
<h3>Scholarship Collection Report</h3>
<p>The following scholarships were received from our newspaper readers yesterday: Brother Jia (submitted by Pu Jiting, recovering health) five yuan, Weng Changshou five hundred yuan, Na Jinghu one hundred yuan, totaling one thousand one hundred yuan in national currency, with a balance of one million ninety-five thousand three hundred and forty-one yuan.</p>
<h3>Meat and Vegetable Side Dishes Should Be Sold According to Limited Prices</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Central Market has separately set limited prices for vegetables and meat, which have been successively announced and implemented. Therefore, all operators or vendors must sell according to these limited prices and must not deliberately increase prices. Otherwise, they will not be allowed to trade, or their broker qualifications will be revoked.</p>

<h3>Today's First Division Football Match: Tung Wah vs. Jewish, 3:30 PM at Jiaozhou Park</h3>

Tan Fuzhen has returned to the team yesterday and will serve as the center back. Ah Dai will still serve as the center forward, and the front line can be considered well-organized, and the middle line is particularly ideal. However, the strength of the Jewish team should not be underestimated. Although Fafan Gan has left, Greenberg has returned, and the lineup is quite complete. When the two teams meet, it is expected to be exciting.</p>

<p>How to Make Enterprises Prosper and Grow? Economic Commentary.</p>
<p>Yesterday's discussion focused on how to improve the performance of the banking industry, emphasizing that the key lies in rationalizing operations and investing in production industries. The same holds true for enterprises. To achieve prosperity and growth, creating a wartime economic boom, it is essential to first focus on rationalizing operations and management, and secondly, invest in industries crucial to the current situation. What constitutes rationalized operations and management? It means that an enterprise's operations and management must be established on a scientific basis, free from outdated ideas, and that the recruitment, training, and cultivation of various technical talents are the most important priorities for today's business community. What constitutes industries crucial to the current situation? That is, all production industries that contribute to the needs of the country during wartime and provide assistance to the lives of the people during wartime should be vigorously promoted. In short, on the one hand, research and increase production, from raw materials to finished products, with detailed, thorough, and practical rational methods in all departments and details. At the same time, broadly gather social capital to ensure that it is used appropriately for the wartime economy.</p>
<p>According to statistics on capital increases in Shanghai's business community for August and September this year, capital increases by financial institutions in the city took the lead, with 147 companies increasing capital in those two months, totaling over 100 million yuan. Due to the Ministry of Finance's order for banks to increase their capital to the newly stipulated standards, other types of enterprises also followed suit in increasing capital, resulting in the aforementioned achievements. This type of capital increase under normal economic prosperity is indeed a good phenomenon in the wartime economic sector, needless to say. However, the business direction and methods after the capital increase need to be constantly studied in light of the wartime economic environment, with a deep and clear understanding.</p>
<p>Department Stores: Wing On, Sincere, and National Products companies all saw small volume; underwear decreased slightly; Sincere Department Store opened higher, completing half the transaction.</p>
<p>Textiles: Wing On Textile's volume was small, half of it blocked; China Textiles returned within the customs, shrinking the most; Xinhe and Mayer were flat; Rongfeng advanced upwards, Wuhe's bid rose; small denominations were listed; Dagong, Tianlun, and other stocks were all pushed up by buyers; Zhenfeng Cotton Textiles also held firm; Jingfu Shirt Factory's transactions were made outside the customs; Jinglun saw new prices again; Yuan Yuan Dyeing and Printing's transactions were not quiet.</p>
<p>New Leaf and New Asia Pharmaceutical factories continued to rise; Sino-French initially weakened, but eventually rebounded; New Star Pharmaceutical factory was also firm; the rest were flat.</p>
<p>Finance: Zhejiang Xing had transactions; Continental, Jin Cheng, etc., remained flat.</p>
<p>Culture: Commercial Press and China Bookstore's asking price was the same as the previous day, with few sales; World Bookstore rose significantly; Standard Paper Products has already been favored by investors.</p>
<p>Public Utilities: Zhabei Water and Electricity was slightly weak; China Merchants Electric was firmly reversed; Xiang Sheng Tricycle was also pushed up; Jinlong Electric's upgrades did not stop.</p>

<p>Chinese Stock Exchange Strengthening Trading Mechanisms to Prevent Speculation, Buying Short, and Selling Short.</p>
<p>After the Chinese Stock Exchange opened on the 8th of the month, the installation of market telephones and other equipment has now been completed. The market opens at 9:30 AM every day and closes at 12:00 PM. More than 160 approved brokers have each sent an agent to the floor for trading. The listed Chinese stocks are temporarily 108 companies, specializing in trading spot Chinese stocks, limited to next-day settlement. During this period, the commission charged by the exchange to brokers is 0.0625%, which will be changed to 0.125% after a certain period of time. As for the commissions charged by brokers to customers, both buyers and sellers are charged 0.5%, and the transaction tax for sellers is 0.06%. According to reporters, for the sake of facilitating settlement for brokers, the possibility of weekly settlement is being seriously considered. At the same time, efforts are being made to prevent speculative manipulation and illegal activities such as buying short and selling short. Before proper solutions are obtained, next-day settlement will be the principle. Regarding the crackdown on off-exchange transactions, the exchange has already consulted with relevant authorities to strictly enforce it, as off-exchange transactions are not permitted by law. Moreover, the exchange's regulations stipulate that similar exchanges cannot be established within the same area. Subsequently, the opening and closing prices of Chinese stocks in the market have been coordinated with the relevant authorities to be announced by the exchange on a daily basis to prevent abuses. It is also reported that the exchange is currently seeking to strengthen and improve the trading mechanism. Furthermore, for the purpose of continuing to promote futures trading, the exchange is actively planning to open 7-day settlement business. It is reported that preparations are nearing completion, and it is planned to test the waters with approximately 30 stocks that are more liquid. It is expected that concrete measures will be decided by the end of the month.</p>
<p>One Thousand Tons of Soybeans to be Shipped from Xuzhou to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Relevant authorities in the city are making every effort to collect raw materials for oil extraction. In addition to offering prices for purchase, they are also using surplus materials from the local area to exchange for various oil grains with North China. It is reported that one thousand tons of soybeans will be shipped from Xuzhou to Shanghai, and are expected to arrive by the end of this month or the beginning of next month. The authorities will distribute these soybeans to various oil extraction plants to step up production.</p>
<p>Trends in Chinese Stocks.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks showed mixed gains and losses, with new and old stocks presenting a divergent picture. Investors, seeing that old stocks such as Wing On Department Store and Wing On Textile have already exceeded other stocks, shifted their focus to new stocks with small denominations, such as Guohua Investment, Jingfu Shirt Factory, Jinglun Shirt Factory, China Film, Standard Flavor Essence, Xin Yi and Yong Xing Real Estate, etc. Amidst a wave of acquisitions and pushes, the magnitude of the rise was unexpected. The mood on all sides was still in a state of uncertainty, and trading was quite active. Today's stock performance is recorded below.</p>
<p>Summary of Market Conditions.</p>
<p>Government Bonds: Yesterday, the market continued to weaken, and sentiment was relatively weak. Prices generally trended downward. Each listing faced fierce competition, and sellers appeared as soon as there was strength. A sale would immediately cause a small drop, making it easy to trigger a downward trend. However, it was also quite easy to rebound after the selling stopped, so it did not escape consolidation. Yesterday, Category C bonds were initially pushed up in price against each other, but after opening, there were more sellers, making it difficult to enter and easy to exit. The market price gradually declined, falling straight down to the lowest price of the day at noon. Categories A, B, D, and E all fell, but D was higher than B, because there has been some recent absorption of Category D for collection.</p>
<p>Interbank Lending Rate: Yesterday morning, the interbank lending rate announced by the Money Industry Association was 1.7%, with no changes.</p>
<p>Grain: Yesterday, the market resumed its downward trend. The reason was that the Rice and Grain Association had achieved considerable success in handling rice, and shipments were about to arrive in Shanghai, leading to a relaxation in sentiment. Cargo owners were willing to sell at lower prices. Oil and grain were also facing active preparations for purchasing work, and buying sentiment was still difficult to boost, causing prices to trend towards flatness.</p>
<p>Rayon: After consecutive days of gains, some profit-takers suddenly began selling yesterday, and buyers also decreased, causing prices to fall sharply.</p>
<p>Northern Goods: Due to the continuous arrival of goods and cautious observation by buyers, the market showed a trend of stagnation. In recent days, except for red dates, which saw a small number of transactions, the rest were weak and without buyers.</p>

<p>Unfortunate Families of Women and Children - China Women and Children Relief Association.</p>
<p>The main characteristic of their lives is the word "frugality". Uniformly dressed in blue cotton cheongsams and short cloth shoes, they only have one meal and one bowl of porridge each day, eating rice at 10:30 AM and porridge at 5:30 PM, a very difficult life. However, because they emphasize cleanliness and hygiene, they all look like women from middle-class families, completely different from the poor children in the men's and children's homes. In addition to nursing books, learning, and work, their daily lives also include appropriate physical education and exercise. Aside from 20% of their work income being deducted by the institution for public expenses, the rest is entirely at their disposal to cover clothing and daily necessities. Among them, those with special knowledge and skills can often be introduced by the association to factories and private homes for work. When the girls reach marriageable age, the association is responsible for selecting husbands for them. If an applicant is found to be qualified after investigation by the association and the woman is willing, the wedding can be held according to the prescribed procedures. The man only needs to have a proper occupation and a sound personality (including mental, moral, and physical health) without having to pay any fees. This is an equal, harmonious, and meaningful new life.</p>
<p>Implementing a Work-Study System.</p>
<p>Distressed women who have suffered hardships enter the China Women and Children Relief Association's Rest Home, which is like stepping from a dark hell into a bright paradise, from a desolate desert to a warm and happy family. Although they have received considerable security in their lives, in order to maintain their future livelihoods and prevent them from becoming long-term parasites of society, they must be given the necessary basic education and essential skills for survival. Therefore, in recent years, the Women and Children Relief Association has been working hard on positive education in addition to passively providing care.</p>
<p>The distressed women come from different places and have different backgrounds, so there are various difficulties in education, which are different from ordinary girls' schools and technical training classes. On the one hand, they need to break their incorrect superstitious beliefs and prejudices, reduce their past bad habits and unhealthy, unprincipled psychology, and on the other hand, they need to be given positive education. They are divided into student and refugee groups according to age and physical condition. Elderly or disabled women are mostly assigned to the refugee group, and the institution provides them with the necessary food and clothing, except for those who can be repatriated. Work is assigned according to each person's physical strength and age. Those with existing shallow skills are introduced to occupations to support themselves. If they wish to stay in the institution for work, they can also be assigned suitable work. The rest, from the age of fourteen to twenty or thirty, are assigned to the student group and implement a work-study system, providing them with the necessary knowledge and skills so that they can become useful members of society.</p>
<p>At 8:00 AM, it is already time for class. The women, large and small, happily enter their respective classrooms. It is said that there are now five levels from the first grade of primary school to the fifth grade of upper primary school. The curriculum is similar to that of ordinary primary schools, with the main subjects being Chinese, arithmetic, general knowledge, physical education, music, and calligraphy (for the first four grades), and history, geography, and composition (added in the upper grades). If particularly outstanding students are found in academic subjects, they will also receive additional special instruction so that they can continue their studies and seek deeper knowledge. However, the majority only seek to provide the basic knowledge necessary for life. Many female students are busy doing their own work after class at 10:30 AM, because they can earn rewards for their work.</p>
<p>The afternoon is the scheduled work time, guided by specialized teachers, and carried out in groups, including: Sewing (including machine sewing and hand sewing), Knitting (mainly net bags), Embroidery (both coarse and fine work), Shoemaking, and Cooking. The system of combining work and learning is implemented. Although it is said to be afternoon work, the sound of sewing machines can already be heard in the downstairs sewing room in the morning. Most of the work is commissioned by private individuals and factories. The work is more detailed than that done outside, and the wages are lower, so it is very popular. The knitted net bags are also ordered by several merchants. The embroidery department upstairs has [unclear number] sets of embroidery frames, with two female students diligently embroidering on each frame, creating a beautiful sight with both large and small pieces, coarse and fine work. Downstairs is the hand-sewing group for sewing edges and buttons. There are also people busy making shoes. In addition, the cooking class stipulates that students rotate and learn each term, ensuring that students acquire household knowledge.</p>
<p>In the midst of combining work and study, the lives of distressed women become more fulfilling. If they have good results in the association, they will become healthy female citizens when they leave the association and return to their own families or to society.</p>
<p>Social Service: Widows and Orphans. Frugality to Aid Those in Distress.</p>
<p>Having Experienced the Hardships of the World.</p>
<p>Ji Sheng is a person who came from a poor background, so he knows the loneliness and helplessness of widows and orphans, with no one to turn to, and the various inhuman lives they lead. Especially like Ji Sheng and his mother, who are honest and kind by nature, the suffering of being oppressed by the environment and being unreasonably bullied is truly indescribable. Therefore, after deep reflection, he is determined to remember it in his heart and uses the 500 yuan of savings he has saved to help a truly distressed compatriot, doing his duty as a human being to the best of his ability. Signed, A Distressed Successor, Song Jisheng.</p>
