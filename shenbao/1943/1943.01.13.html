<p>社評</p>
<h3>戰時生產與中小工業</h3>
<p>戰時工業生產的目標是增加物資，適應參戰的需要，同時滿足老百姓的生活必需的要求，以安定大東亞戰爭後方的秩序，而取得戰爭最後勝利。</p>
<p>增加戰時生產的方法，必需適應本國經濟的實際情形，連日社評，迭有說明，有人主張採取重點主義，着重於太企業的生產，這種主張，在某種意義上，自然是對的。大規模的工廠和礦山，如果能够乘機發展，可以使中國落後的產業，走上現代化的大路，這一層是很重要的。但是以當前的戰爭局面和國民一般最迫切的需要而言，如果單靠國營的工業和礦業，單靠一部份比較大的民營工業，或是單靠日本在華的大工業，大礦業，實際上是很不够的。爲了戰時中日政府和國民生活的迫切需要，必須努力於中小工業生產之經營和推進。</p>
<p>因爲中國是一個中小資產占優勢的國家，因此，也是一個以中小工業生產佔優勢的國家，小規模的　品生產，佔着極大的比重。一百多年來，在英美賓本的打擊之下，這些小規模的商品經濟，固然已是百孔千瘡但是，他們仍然在極困難的情况下掙扎下去。中日事變以來，因爲英美商品來源斷絕，各地新式工業的產量不足，奄奄一息的小手工業和農村小工業，便有小小的發展機會，這種小生產，他們是分散的，沒有計劃地自然甦生的。可是，總合起來計劃，它們對於整個國民經濟却有極大的貢獻。以棉紗來說，手搖機的生產，可以給大工廠生產以補充；以鋼鐵來說，土法煉成的灰口鐵，可以作爲大工業煉鋼的主要原料。而這種手搖機和土法鍊鐵的土爐，疏疏落落地散佈在各小城市各小鄕村。可是，爲着過去幾年來中日雙方當局都沒有注意他們對於國民經濟的重要性，都沒有加意扶助，聽其自生自減，這是很可惜的。</p>
<p>爲了增加物資，今後必須注意中小工業生產。第一，要在金融上盡力給中小工業生產者以資金上的幫助。不過，這裏必須注意避免重慶政權所謂「工貸的缺陷，因爲重慶的工業貸款，只有一部份較大的企業才能借得到，中小工業是無法享受的。因爲要貸金，必須有固定資本作抵押，或作爲借款的標準。可是，一個手工業者有什麼可以作抵押呢？他們沒有物質上的信用，他們人事上也不够資格。所以，如果抄襲重慶的工貸辦法，中小工業資金困難無法解決，如何　得到發展生產？最好是把分散的中小工業和手工業者，組成一個集體，銀行對這集體組織作爲放款的對象，而這中小工業集體也可以在政府領導和本身自治的形式之中，努力於生產建設。</p>
<p>共次，是原料問題，中小工業的原料，一般說，都是土產，本來是不成問題的，但是，因爲交通運輸的困難，以及其他種種原因，使中小工業的原料極感缺乏。例如他們買不到棉紗，中小紡織業就不得不停工。還有雖然可以買到原料，但是這些原料旣是通過五關十卡，成本浩大，也足以减少中小工業生產者從業的勇氣。所以，不　發展生產則已，否則，那種　制中小工業生產的辦法—特別是在人事方面—必須澈底改變。</p>
<p>此外，一方面是要减輕中小工業者的負担，除去一些不應存在的捐稅，提高他們的生產情緒，增强他們的生產能力。另一方面還得因勢利導，改良中小工業的生產技衛，提高其生產效率，在產品的樣式上亦不斷的革新，達到標準化的程度。而最重要的，在於給予中小工業生產以自由發展的機會，一方面除去一切不合理的人爲的阻礙，一方面切實給予各項幫助。如果把對付獨佔資本的辦法來對待他們，那就成爲殺鷄使用牛刀了。其實，這把牛刀是不合用的。</p>
<p>總而言之，要發展戰時工業生產，不能不振興中小工業生產。要振興中小工業生產，就不能不在金融上給以便利，在捐稅上力求减輕，在技術上研究改良，並保障他們能獲得便宜的原料，尤其是不能不給他們以自由發展的機會，並且在各地切實推廣合作事業。特別要提出的，爲了鞏固戰時國民經濟，爲了補充大東亞戰爭的物資的需要，對於中小工業生產，對於工礦各業的生產，都必須從如何發展方面着眼。古人說：「百姓足，君孰與不足？」這句名言，也可以引用到今日發展戰時工業問題上來。當然，今日談增進生產，並不能忘却緊縮通貨和嚴禁囤積居奇，吾則，一切努力還不免受到影響。</p>

<h3>桂林廠商的難題　原料不足·資金困難　運輸阻遲·勞工缺乏</h3>
<p>五年以前，那片還是荒蕪的平原、到如今經過千百個工人的開墾，耕耘，灌溉，那礫石中已長出了壯麗的新芽，一個新的工業區在長成中。這百十個大小機械鐵工廠的長成，直接間接貢獻不少力量。他們在這艱苦過程中，有着他們一段奮鬥的歷史，到今日，他們知道了當前的晦暗，給與他們若干困難。這些困苦都是嚴重的現實問題。</p>
<p>艱苦過程</p>
<p>他們都來自濱海沿岸，各個爲了保全自己的資產，爲了發展工業，不惜輾轉流徙，或將機件千里內移，或到此新起爐灶，他們堅定自己的信念，始終能站在生產綫上，從事發展。衹看他數年來的成績，就愧死了那些動搖的資本家，或囤積居奇的商人。他們的精力，集中在研究和試騐各種工業上的代用品，如沈宜甲氏的內燃問題之研究，曾發現無烟煤代替汽油，有烟煤自造電石，及提煉烟煤自造汽油等，解決了不少油料供給問題。而無烟煤氣機的製造，及中國動力機製造廠的動力機製造等，亦解決了部份的動力問題。他如機器的改造，如各廠從事於汽車改裝木炭機酒精車，亦解決了一部份的運輸困難，再如君武機廠對於農具的設計改造，如打稻機，玉蜀黍脫粒機，離心機（即製白糖機），榨蔗機，羊式犁，中耕器，磨粉機，切蔓機，木質抽水機等，這多是利用少數原料和簡單機械製成而增加了農業生產的工作效率，這些貢獻，都不在少。</p>
<p>他們雖有原料來源困難之苦，但並不因此稍爲氣餒，他們設法搜集原料，利用廢物，節省使用。他們說：「比如銅最缺少的話，那我們不拘泥於過去的成規，一定非銅不成的老例，在可能範圍內可以減用，而以比較好的鐵來代替。這種做法，雖然機器的壽命比較短，如果用銅製的機器可用十年，而用鐵製的衹能用五年，其壽命雖然相差一半，但是這些機器，我們也衹需要使用五年，因爲五年後，銅鐵生產與各種情勢都改變了，到那時我們再用全銅的來製造過。」</p>
<p>很多事情，可以知道在過去廠家們的那種想壓倒他人生產，「同行如敵國」的獨佔觀念，已有了進步的改變，這在他們的工作中之互相合作，原料的互相調劑借用等事實，都有能表現出來。他們深深地感覺到，在今日個人力量是單薄的，非用集體力量不能解決問題，現在擺在他們面前需要解決而又不是他們的能力所能克服的困難，還多着呢。</p>
<p>鋼鐵問題</p>
<p>鋼鐵是工業的主要原料，而目前那百十個工廠，也就正在愁眉苦臉地籌劃着，如何得到這些原料，他們衹是苦愁，據他們所知道的鋼鐵生產是那樣缺乏，鍊鋼鍊鐵工業，還沒有大規模的成績，但維持現狀是不成問題的。</p>
<p>在××鍊鋼廠每月雖有百餘噸生產，而湘桂沿綫工廠，月需三百噸以上，私營的工廠，難望其能分潤。因此，很多工廠都自行設法。中國動力機製造廠，目前正從事於原料自給自足，該廠廠長湯仲平氏說：「目前自己能想辦法的，還是自己打算好，希望常會使人落空。現在有一個不好的現象，就是一方面工廠急需鋼鐵使用，另方面則沒有人珍惜這些原料，浪費遺棄的現象，常可看到，很多公家的東西，情願儘其遺棄路上，而不願意需要的人取來使用。」</p>
<p>桂市民用工廠所需的鋼鐵，本來可以向湖南××的鋼鐵廠自由購買，但有三種困難：（一）訂貨時得先付足貨價；（二）定貨與交貨時間要距離六個月以上；（三）運輸困難。這三種困難，不但難了民營的小工廠，就是資本雄厚的廠商，也覺束手。以第一·二項困難來說，定貨時要付足現價，而交了錢後，還要隔半年才有貨交。資本短少的工廠不用說，就算有相當資本的，也未必能彀辦到，何況還有最大的難關——運輸，更難於解決呢！所以赴湘購辦原料，差不多可以稱爲此路不通。</p>
<p>急需動力</p>
<p>他們對於動力的供給問題，也和需要原料一樣重要，同時也和原料一樣的得不到什麽幫助。××工廠區的工廠所需的動力，多是取給於湘桂路電廠，規模較大的廠就自己發電，大家都感到不彀使用，而認爲一個相當嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>在有供給電力責任的廣西電廠方面，當然也有他們供不應求的困難，但據說電廠方面，還有兩架配給木炭爐的柴油機，沒有開動。此外湘桂路局有新電廠的增設，其目的就在供給若干工廠動力的使用，該廠現在尚未發電，而要求預定供給用電的人，所需要的數量，已經超過了那點擊所能供給的數量的一倍以上了。這足見目前桂市工廠需要動力的迫切了。今後桂市的電力使用，如何限制其浪費，如何的合理分配給各需要動力的工廠，如何的增強電力設備，都是一般民用工廠的期望，也是電力廠當局極應注意的問題。</p>
<p>資金困難</p>
<p>民營工廠的流動資金漸感不靈，正因爲購買原料的不易和運輸困難，物價高漲種種的影響，一位常具有三十萬元流動資金的廠主，他很感慨的說：「戰前我們在無錫開廠，有上三四萬的流動資金，就足夠周轉了。現在就相差得太遠了，目前就常有三四十萬現金作爲周轉的，也非易事。比如要到湖南去定購一批貨，不說多，鐵買十餘噸吧，平均就得先付價款十餘萬元。煤也買到四五千元一頓，一次買四五十噸就要二十餘萬元。那三四十萬的現金，也　能預定一次貨款之用。其他的動用就不易周轉了。且訂一次貨，就要半年時間，纔能到手，而再要從事生產後，始能換回現金」有三十萬流動資金的廠家，尚有如此困難，其他更可想而知了。向銀行請求貸款嗎？第一，不容易借到手；第二，銀行根本對於發展工業，不發生興趣。</p>
<p>運輸工人</p>
<p>運輸問題，除了車輛難找到外，還有檢查關卡的留難。據沈宜甲氏說：他廠裏除了需用鋼鐵外，因爲還要從事於集中研究實騐工作，需用若干化學藥品，而這些多是洋貨，有時得到別處購買，然而買到貨後，找到車子，還是空的，因爲在運輸途中，沿途的檢查關卡，不是說物資倒流，就是說工業原料「向外」運出，檢騐扣留，便有難上加難之苦。</p>
<p>其次技工的缺乏，在戰後雖增加了不少技術工人，然工業生產範圍亦增減擴大，到處增加新廠，需要工人。而一個工人至少要有四五年的工作經騐，才算熟練。新廠增加的比率，比工人的供量要快，變成了廠多工人少的現象。那些新廠找不到工人就同舊廠找，大家互相標價明拉暗搶，弄得那些工人常常發生動搖。這種不安定的生活，對於工人效率無法提高，無形中影響生產的減少。</p>
<p>這次港九　國技工本來很多，但是參加到民營工廠工作的並不多，其中有些因爲此地的工廠設備不全，生活苦，工價低，不能安於工作而離去的很多。（三一年十二月十五日寄）</p>

<h3>嗜好與人生</h3>
<p>— 海麟</p>
<p>讀到本刋「社會病的一種——打麻將」之後，的確，這是一種不良的「嗜好」，要設法救治也眞是一件不容易的事，「禁賭」固然是一種積極的方法，但「賭博」這件事，人們會千方百計去犯它，雖然，他們從不曾聽見某人是「因賭起家的」，可是「賭」，想贏錢的尚是其次要目的，主要的還是人們空閒之後便追求嗜好，於是意志不堅強的便養成賭的嗜好。</p>
<p>研究到這一層便可以發現，每一個人都有它的嗜好，而且都當作第二生命似的看重，於是在這裏面便分出良好的嗜好和不良的嗜好。</p>
<p>社會中有許多青年人，不能賺錢便先學會抽香烟，甚至於跑跑跳舞塲，賭塲……漸漸走上墮落的道路。雖然開設這些紙醉金迷塲所的唯利是圖的老闆要負起大部份責任，但一方面的責任是要自己負起的。有些人被「逢場作戲」所害，以爲「偶一爲之」不見得會有什麽危險，但是那一個不是「一失足成千古恨」的呢？</p>
<p>有些青年人大聲叫着「苦悶」，是的，每一個人在年青時是感覺到苦悶，但並不能拿它當作冠冕堂皇的原因去尋求刺激的安慰，而且結果總是越陷越深，所以我們應當相反地利用有益的嗜好，打破這苦悶。不能任性去走上滅亡之途。</p>
<p>環境不能使我們滿足我們的智識慾，這是青年人很好的熱血的表現，旣然如次，那麼我們應當拿出自己的力量去追求合理的喜愛的一方面，而這方面所得到的往往是最寶貴的有價值的一部份。</p>
<p>青年人應有良好的嗜好多得很，例如喜歡研究書本上學問的，可以常常到圖書館去，裏面是智識的寶庫，正怕你不去利用，記得孫總理在年青時，貧困得一籌莫展，幸而許多革命同志在華僑同胞處募集一筆不小的款子去顧念孫總理的生活，可是那知道他竟一錢不留全數去買書看，結果，生活還是困苦非凡，這種好讀書的嗜好確是令人敬佩，可見一個人的成功，和他的嗜好也有很大關係的。總理的偉著三民主義還不是他多讀書的收穫嗎？</p>
<p>現代人的智識是應該多方面的，我們應找尋與自己前途與愛好有關的嗜好作終身伴侶，它可以解決你的煩悶，增長你的智識，幫助你的事業。</p>
<h3>印藏邊境（下）</h3>
<p>— 家源</p>
<p>長夜月下弦而頗明亮，隨沈氏步至山頭，遙視西北高空，雲端之上，露出光閃雪白之處，即喜馬拉雅山之最高峯。山頂積雪，終年不化，峯名英人稱之爲Kang　ChenGunga，其海拔高度爲二萬四千英尺。據書中所載，喜馬拉雅山之高峯爲埃佛斯峯，高度爲二萬九千零二十二尺。不悉是否即爲此峯，抑另有高於此者，尚待考正。</p>
<p>其時，雲淡風輕，但見西北一片蜿蜒而下，微露出一座雪白山頭，有凸有凹，呈現於白雲之間，長空萬里，仰視有頃，待白雲全部遮蔽之際，乃返室就寢。</p>
<p>次晨，沈校長起床繪畫之際，記者亦隨其往昨夜仰視之處，繼續憑眺山景，是時東方紅日漸升，陽光返照喜馬拉雅山高峯之白雪，金光礫礫，峯形如金字塔之式樣，惟相隔遙遠，　數層山巒所阻，僅可見其上半截，但山峯明暗之處，尚能加以辨別，尤其兩側圍繞之較小山峯相襯，成爲衆山拱峙，特立之壯。是時白雲上升，山峯忽隱忽現，尤予人以快感。</p>
<p>沈校長　　寫生，於山峯起變化之際，幾覺爲難。衹有以濃厚之油墨不斷塗抹。直至八時許山峯爲濃雲所遮，喜馬拉雅山之眞面即隱蔽不復再見矣。至此，主任黎氏携来茶點牛奶，沈校長並爲我介紹，招待甚殷，直至九時許，始告辭而出。</p>
<p>錫金·不丹·尼泊爾</p>
<p>噶倫堡，雖有人口兩萬，但大都商民，以及窮苦之苦力，文化水準不高，故新聞紙尚屬缺少。如全市只有月刋藏文報一紙，主編人爲塔青巴布（Tharchin）。用石印印刷，發行三百份，多數銷行西藏各地，及尼泊爾，不丹，錫金等三小國、</p>
<p>承沈校長陪伴於十九日晨，往訪該報，該社亦在半山之上，設備簡陋。塔青巴布，因久居斯土，對尼泊爾，不丹，錫金等三小國知之甚祥。記者抵印後，本有訪問該三小國之意，因尼，不兩國保守性甚深，對外籍人士入境，阻礙甚烈，故過去國人除黃慕松曾入不丹訪問外，其他尚未有入。在加爾各答時，據「駐印專員公署」秘書劉達人所談，尼，不兩國在德里均駐有領事，若正式前往交涉，或有可能，惟手續太繁，聞蔣建白有入尼，不兩國訪問之意，不悉有無結果。</p>
<p>記者將尼泊爾，不丹，錫金三國之內幕，請教於塔青巴布時，彼因怱促之間，很多問題因事前未加預備，亦難以解答。茲僅記其所談錄誌於次：</p>
<p>「三小國中，除錫金（哲孟雄）係英國之保護國，地面狹小，爲通藏之要道，所轄之大吉嶺，噶倫堡，已置於印度政府範圍以內不計外，現僅存剛都，爲國王居住之區，國內一切政治，軍事，外交均由英國辦理。」</p>
<p>置於尼泊爾，不丹，情形則略異，英政府每月照常給予津貼，其數字不詳。按照過去爲十萬羅比，現在有無加增，亦不大明悉。</p>
<p>尼泊爾位於北部，國土面積長約一千三百哩，闊約五百餘哩，不丹位於南部，與印之阿薩密接壤，闊圍凡二千五百餘里。至兩國之政體，同爲專制政體，國內政治不受英國干涉。尼泊爾人民，素性強悍，（即所謂廓爾喀種）國內人口達三百萬，且對外繁殖力甚強，故於印度阿薩密及克什米爾均由其僑民。國內除自練軍隊外，並以多數壯丁服務於英國軍中。</p>
<p>不丹人口較少，約一百五十萬人。無軍隊組織，因其處於大山之　，無外來侵略，亦不需要軍隊。</p>
<p>兩國均處於豐腴之地，人民生活甚優，出產有五穀，雜糧，蔬菜，白　，果木之類，惟對外交通均甚不便，全　象及騾馬等畜力，值此　地烽火之際，該國等置身事外，確如「世外桃源」。</p>
<p>記者按：上述三國原爲我國藩屬，朝貢之國，除哲孟雄屬英之保護，我國予以承認外，而尼，不兩國雖未正式承認，但已與我國無絲毫外交關係矣。（酬移濟貧金）</p>
<h3>禁止隨地吐痰的小貢獻</h3>
<p>— 冰</p>
<p>讀了「禁止隨地吐痰的建議」一文。據汪君的建議，是以自警亭爲標準，或每一，或隔一的設立痰盂，固然說得有理。但是全上海有多少自警亭呢？那一筆買痰盂的費用，要多大呢？而且吐痰時難免有吐在外面或吐在痰盂蓋上，那麼爲了預防病菌的傳染，而設置痰盂的目的不是失其本意嗎？或有人說：「用水沖」但不是有許多地方取水不便，這不覺很麻煩嗎？</p>
<p>以我個人意見，最好是將馬路邊的陰溝作爲痰盂，陰溝在一個短距離內即有一個，較自警亭多，可以足夠所需，決不會感到缺乏的。再者衛生局令清道夫常常用水沖陰溝，不使吐在外面痰留在蓋上，病菌的傳染亦無從而起了。</p>
<p>所以旣不用費去偌大一筆的款子，又可減去病菌的傳染，這不是自己方便大家方便的事嗎？</p>
<h3>不要怕！</h3>
<p>— 小麟</p>
<p>不要怕「工作，」沒有一個人因工作要死，只有人因怕工作的艱難憂慮而死，担心是憂慮的根源，見了工作便先担心，使你產生不合理的思想，使你對於工作失去了平衡和努力幹一下的精神，於是見一件怕一件，於是一事無成，躊蹰而了却可貴的一生。</p>
<p>不要怕「愛」，人生沒有愛便不知道快樂是甚麼東西，健康的精神需要愛的培植，健全的人生需要愛的鼓勵，天下可愛的東西多得很，靠了慈母的愛，孩子才能長成，靠了偉大的愛，生活才會前進，要愛必須要有一個條件；那就是先把你自己弄成「可愛」。</p>
<p>不要怕「苦」，苦是人生鍛鍊要素，苦的後面才有甜，苦了才有成功，天下沒有一個不嘗到苦的成功人。</p>
<p>不要怕「死」，「死」沒有人能避免，最要緊的還是準備怎樣「死」才有價值，不要使自己一死便完全消滅，應當把精神與靈魂留在世上再「死」。</p>
<h3>萬世師表</h3>
<p>— James　Hilton著　依今譚</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>她的名字是加德鄰·布里治斯（Catherine　Bridges）：她二十五歲——年輕到足以作吉普斯的女兒。她有藍色的閃光的眼睛，生雀斑的面頰，和光滑而微黃的頭髮。她也住在一個農家，和一個女友同度着假期，她以爲她對於吉普斯的意外是應該負責的，所以就每日騎了腳踏車，沿着湖，到這個安靜的，中年的，道貌岸然的人所躺着的屋子裏來。</p>
<p>這就是她最初所想到的他的情形。而他呢，則因爲她會騎了腳踏車，毫無畏懼地來探訪一個獨居在農舍起坐室中的男子，總有些弄不明白，這世界究竟在變到什麽地步。他的挫傷只好依賴她的仁慈，並且不久，事情就明白起來，他是何等需要着那種慈悲。她是一個失業的家庭女教師，有一些錢積蓄着；她讀過易卜生的作品，很崇拜他；她甚至想，她們應該有選舉權。在政治上，她是一個急進者，她的觀點正傾向着像蕭伯納和毛里斯（William　Monis）諸人。在華斯台爾·海德·每一個暑天的下午，她將她所有的觀念與見解，都向吉普斯傾筐倒篋的說了出來；而他呢，因爲他並不很會說話，所以起初他想，這不值得去和她爭辯。她的朋友走了，但是她仍舊留着；吉普斯又想，對於這樣一個人，你能夠做些什麽呢？他時常扶了杖，一拐一拐地沿着一條小徑到那小小的禮拜堂去：在那邊牆上有一塊石板，坐在上面很舒服，一方面對着陽光和大山頂的鬱鬱蒼蒼，一方面聽着一個—唔，似的，吉普斯不得不承認——很美麗的姑娘，喋喋地談着話。</p>
<p>從來沒有過到過像她這樣的任何人。他曾時常想，現代派，這種「新婦女」的事情，一定會使他不敢接近；而現在呢，她就是這樣的人，却使他可以用確定的眼光，看她坐了腳踏車，安全地繞着湖疾駛。而她呢，也從來沒有遇到過像他這樣的任何人。她也時常想，中年的男子，讀着「泰晤士」報，否定着一切現代的東西，總是可怕的厭物；可是，現在呢，他就是這樣的人，却比了和她同齡的青年男子，更會引起她的興趣與注意。（十）</p>

<p>（一）黃玉麟劉清康問：患遺精二年服「英德蒙」，「普勒生固精片」，有效否？無效則服何藥？腦漏服何藥有效？（除開刀外）？答：所詢治遺精二藥，服亦無妨，效否不能保證。最要者爲原因治療，如向犯手淫者，即當禁絕等是。思想亦須純靜，同時注重全身發育健康，專靠服藥，而原因未去，仍難見效。所謂腦漏，究指何病，腦豈可漏乎？如經醫師診斷必須開刀，仍以開刀爲宜，不然則注重全身營養，如能身體健康或可望抵抗力之增加，而免該病之繼續惡化。</p>
<p>（二）鎭海吳翔生，問：與患疥瘡之親戚同住，致被傳染，全身各部發生奇癢，抓之起紅色微粒，且時有生膿之瘡生於手足等處，甚痛，曾注射日藥六〇六，未見效。請教治法。答：患爲疥瘡合併膿痂疹，因疥瘡後由化膿菌傳染所致。若求速愈，必同時撲滅疥虫及化膿菌。六〇六非本病特效藥，故無確效。本病非不可愈，乃因從復傳染而復發，故必須與染者隔離，或同時治療，衣服被褥須每日更換，煮沸消毒，庶免傳染再發。治療之法，外用單純疥瘡藥，可以百分之二十硫磺軟膏，用力塗擦，塗擦愈力，則治効愈速，合併膿痂疹時，因用藥複雜，另附方配用，同時內服，百膿清，或消治龍等同類藥品，或注射該藥亦可。</p>

<h3>Wartime Production and Small and Medium Industries</h3>
<p>The goal of wartime industrial production is to increase supplies, adapt to the needs of the war effort, and simultaneously satisfy the essential needs of the people, in order to stabilize the rear of the Greater East Asia War and achieve final victory in the war.</p>
<p>The method of increasing wartime production must be adapted to the actual economic situation of the country. This newspaper has repeatedly commented on this matter. Some people advocate adopting a focus on key industries, emphasizing the production of large enterprises. This view is naturally correct in a certain sense. If large-scale factories and mines can take the opportunity to develop, it can lead China's backward industries onto the path of modernization, which is very important. However, considering the current war situation and the most pressing needs of the general public, it is actually insufficient to rely solely on state-owned industries and mines, a portion of relatively large private industries, or large-scale Japanese industries and mining in China. For the urgent needs of the Chinese and Japanese governments and people during the war, efforts must be made to operate and promote the production of small and medium-sized industries.</p>
<p>Because China is a country dominated by small and medium-sized assets, it is also a country dominated by small and medium-sized industrial production, with small-scale commodity production accounting for a very large proportion. For more than a hundred years, under the impact of British and American businesses, these small-scale commodity economies have been riddled with holes. However, they are still struggling in extremely difficult circumstances. Since the Sino-Japanese War, because the source of British and American goods has been cut off and the output of new industries in various places is insufficient, small handicrafts and rural small industries that are on the verge of dying have a small opportunity for development. This type of small production is decentralized, spontaneously reviving without planning. However, when planned and combined, they make a great contribution to the overall national economy. Taking cotton yarn as an example, the production of hand-cranked machines can supplement the production of large factories. Taking steel as an example, the gray cast iron smelted by local methods can be used as the main raw material for large-scale industrial steelmaking. And these hand-cranked machines and earthen furnaces for local iron smelting are sparsely distributed in small cities and small villages. However, it is a pity that neither the Chinese nor the Japanese authorities have paid attention to their importance to the national economy in the past few years, and they have not intentionally supported them, allowing them to develop or decline on their own.</p>
<p>In order to increase supplies, we must pay attention to the production of small and medium-sized industries in the future. First, we must do our best to provide financial assistance to small and medium-sized industrial producers. However, we must pay attention to avoiding the so-called "defects of industrial loans" of the Chongqing regime, because only a part of the larger enterprises can obtain industrial loans in Chongqing, and small and medium-sized industries cannot enjoy them. Because to obtain a loan, there must be fixed assets as collateral or as a standard for borrowing. But what can a craftsman mortgage? They have no material credit, and they are not qualified in terms of personnel. Therefore, if we copy Chongqing's industrial loan methods, the financial difficulties of small and medium-sized industries cannot be solved. How can we achieve development and production? It is best to form the dispersed small and medium-sized industries and craftsmen into a collective, and the bank will use this collective organization as the target of loans. This small and medium-sized industrial collective can also strive for production and construction under the leadership of the government and in the form of its own autonomy.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the issue of raw materials. Generally speaking, the raw materials for small and medium-sized industries are all local products, which was not a problem in the first place. However, due to difficulties in transportation and other reasons, the raw materials for small and medium-sized industries are in extreme shortage. For example, if they cannot buy cotton yarn, small and medium-sized textile industries will have to stop work. Also, even if raw materials can be purchased, these raw materials pass through many checkpoints, and the cost is huge, which is enough to reduce the courage of small and medium-sized industrial producers to engage in production. Therefore, unless we do not want to develop production, otherwise, the methods that restrict the production of small and medium-sized industries—especially in terms of personnel—must be thoroughly changed.</p>
<p>In addition, on the one hand, it is necessary to reduce the burden on small and medium-sized industrialists, eliminate some unnecessary taxes and fees, improve their production morale, and enhance their production capacity. On the other hand, it is also necessary to guide them according to the situation, improve the production technology of small and medium-sized industries, improve their production efficiency, and continuously innovate the design of products to reach the level of standardization. Most importantly, it lies in giving small and medium-sized industrial production the opportunity to develop freely, on the one hand, removing all unreasonable artificial obstacles, and on the other hand, providing practical assistance in various aspects. If we treat them with the methods used to deal with monopoly capital, it will be like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. In fact, this sledgehammer is not suitable.</p>
<p>In short, to develop wartime industrial production, we must revitalize the production of small and medium-sized industries. To revitalize the production of small and medium-sized industries, we must provide convenience in finance, strive to reduce taxes and fees, study and improve technology, and ensure that they can obtain cheap raw materials. In particular, we must give them the opportunity to develop freely, and vigorously promote cooperative undertakings in various places. What needs to be emphasized in particular is that in order to consolidate the wartime national economy and to supplement the material needs of the Greater East Asia War, the production of small and medium-sized industries and the production of various industrial and mining industries must be viewed from the perspective of how to develop them. The ancients said, "If the people are well-off, with whom will the ruler be lacking?" This famous saying can also be applied to the issue of developing wartime industries today. Of course, today we cannot forget to tighten the money supply and strictly prohibit hoarding when talking about increasing production, otherwise all efforts will inevitably be affected.</p>
<h3>The Greater East Asia Ministry of Japan Discusses China Policy; Meeting Held This Afternoon; Seeking to Strengthen Cooperation with Vietnam and Thailand</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Domei News Agency) After the Nanjing National Government declared war on Britain and the United States, the Greater East Asia Ministry will hold a meeting at the official residence of the Greater East Asia Minister at 4 p.m. tomorrow to discuss Japan's China policy. Various incidents related to Japan, French Indochina and Thailand will also be discussed. Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam Yoshizawa and Ambassador to Thailand Tsubokami have returned to Japan, and Japan will definitely carry out further cooperation with these countries.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) The Greater East Asia Ministry of Japan held an important consultation on the 11th. Those present were Greater East Asia Minister Aoki, Vice Minister Yamamoto, Director-General Takeuchi, Director-General Usami of the China Affairs Bureau, and various chiefs of the ministry. They jointly discussed the items to be proposed when the parliament reconvenes. In addition, various new situations have occurred after the National Government's participation in the war. It is expected that the ministry will more actively cooperate with the National Government. At the same time, in the future, the Greater East Asia Ministry will not only strengthen its China policy, but also actively promote its overall policies related to the Greater East Asia. Regarding the ministry's budget proposal currently under review, it is generally believed that it includes the Greater East Asia Ministry's own policies. In addition, the ministry has decided to convene all members of the Greater East Asia Ministry and the ministry's leaders at the official residence of the Greater East Asia Minister again on the afternoon of the 13th to discuss the ministry's budget proposal to be submitted to the parliament.</p>
<h3>Negotiations on the Transportation of Vietnamese Supplies to Japan Are Proceeding Smoothly</h3>
<p>Saigon, 12th (Central News Agency) Kuriyama, the chief secretary of the Japanese Embassy in Vietnam, met with Governor-General Decoux at 5 p.m. yesterday for one and a half hours to discuss the implementation agreement for the third year of the Japan-Vietnam economy and general issues. Both sides have reached a consensus on the point that rice and corn are the main commodities transported from Vietnam to Japan in the implementation agreement. Kuriyama told reporters this morning that negotiations on the implementation agreement for the third year of the Japan-Vietnam economy are proceeding smoothly. Among them, on the biggest issues such as rice and corn, except for a small part of technical issues, opinions on various principles have been completely consistent. As for the quantity and value of rice and corn transported to Japan, it is not convenient to explain at this time. It is believed that it will make a great contribution to the food problem in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. As for other issues between Japan and Vietnam, they are all under smooth negotiation. Governor-General Decoux is scheduled to return to Hanoi on the 26th of this month, and subsequent negotiations will be conducted in Hanoi.</p>

The name of the Supreme Court Procuratorate should be changed to the Supreme Procuratorate, and procuratorates should be established in the Higher and Local Courts of each province, such as the Higher Local Procuratorate of a certain province. The original title of Chief Procurator should be changed to Procurator-General. The budget estimates should be independent and distributed by the Ministry of Justice and Administration based on the original funds. As for the salary grade of the Procurator-General, it should be handled in accordance with the newly revised official grade and salary table. All provincial prisons should be changed to supervised by the Procuratorial Corps. The original case should be sent to the Ministry of Justice and Administration, submitted to the Executive Yuan and forwarded to the Central Political Conference for approval, and then submitted to the Legislative Yuan for revision of the articles of the Court Organization Law. (2) Regarding the issue of county magistrates concurrently managing justice, it was resolved that the judicial office and the system of concurrently managing justice should be abolished. (3) Regarding the issue of formulating various special laws in extraordinary times, it was resolved that the case submitted by the Ministry of Justice and Administration should be handled. The Ministry should organize a drafting committee, and the Ministry should issue an order to its subordinate courts at all levels to organize economic law research associations and submit the research results within a time limit.

<h3>Xiao Shuxuan Talks About the Mission of the Chinese New Army; The Current Work Is to Protect the Rear of the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Haitong News Agency) Xiao Shuxuan, President of the Military Council, told Haitong News Agency reporter Trentel yesterday that the current task of the Chinese New Army, which began to be reorganized in October of last year, is to protect the rear of the Japanese army. After this task is completed, China will further participate in actual battles, but there is no precise plan to announce at present, because the military negotiations between China and Japan have not yet concluded. China has unlimited manpower, which is not only a source of troops, but can also be mobilized for industrial development. When Xiao was asked whether China's coast had been strengthened to defend against possible attacks, he replied yes, and said that the recent addition of several warships should be regarded as having strengthened the defense of China's coast and estuaries. As for the strength of our country's air force, it is not strong at present, but there is a plan to expand it, such as striving to train air force personnel as one of the plans.</p>

<h3>Between the Caucasus and the Don River, German Counterpressure Continues to Increase; Unprecedented Fierce Fighting in Stalingrad; Gaps in German Lines Have Been Successfully Filled</h3>
<p>German Headquarters, 12th (Haitong News Agency) Today's German war report stated that the Soviet offensive on the Eastern Front yesterday was still unsuccessful, with heavy losses in manpower and materials. A total of 87 tanks were destroyed. The Soviet army on the southern route of the Eastern Front was annihilated by about one division, and more than a thousand were captured by the German army. Since December 6 of last year, the German army has destroyed a total of 511 Soviet tanks in the Great Don River Bend. Enemy troops attacked the Don River Hungarian army positions and were severely damaged and repulsed. There were only local battles on the middle route. The Soviet army's attack southeast of Lake Ilmen was also unsuccessful, with 24 tanks lost. Traffic on the Murmansk route continued to be bombed by German aircraft.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Haitong News Agency) Military personnel said that the fierce fighting between the Caucasus and the Don River has not yet ended, and the counterpressure exerted by the German army on the enemy is continuing to increase. The Soviet offensive launched on Stalingrad on Sunday was the most fierce ever seen there. The Soviet army had no less than 16 divisions, including 6 tank brigades. Under the fierce attack, only one place in the German line was broken through, but it was immediately filled by the German army. The enemy suffered extremely heavy losses. The Soviet offensive between the Volga River and the Don River continued without progress. The German army continued to occupy several villages downstream of the Don River. In northern Caucasus, the Soviet army once窜into the rear of the German army, but was immediately driven back by the German mechanized troops.</p>
<p>Berne, Switzerland, 12th (Havas) Berlin Radio Station issued a message this morning stating that after German reinforcements arrived in the besieged city of Rzhev, the strength of the German garrison in that area has been enhanced. The Soviet side claimed that the Red Army continued to advance in northern Caucasus and recovered several strongholds. The Red Army is advancing downstream of the Don River, and the German army is resisting fiercely. The Red Army also recovered several strongholds in Zinovievski. Southwest of Rzhev, the Red Army and the German army fought fiercely. According to Berlin news, fierce fighting is currently underway in the Don River Basin, the Caucasus, Stalingrad, and the Don River Bend. The Red Army's winter offensive this year has suffered heavy losses in soldiers and materials, which is no different from previous years. From the 1st to the 10th of this month, the Red Army lost 624 tanks and a large number of aircraft. The Red Army launched an offensive in Stalingrad, and the intensity was unprecedented. After a period of time, 60 tanks were lost. The Red Army used 6 infantry divisions and 6 tank brigades in the offensive. Although several places in the German line were broken through, the gaps were filled after a counterattack. The Red Army suffered heavy losses, the entire army collapsed, and fled in panic. Between the Don River and the Volga River, the Red Army launched repeated offensives with the help of tanks, but was repulsed by the German army. The German army continued to advance and occupied several positions. On the Don River Bend, the German army made progress. The surrounded Red Army broke a gap in the German line, but this army is now in danger of being annihilated.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Haitong News Agency) According to the latest information from the front line, the German army continued to win in the final stage of the major offensive on the southern route of the Eastern Front. In the first ten days of January, German ground forces destroyed 624 Soviet tanks, which shows the intensity of the fighting. Most of the destroyed tanks were made in the Soviet Union, and the number of tanks made in Britain and the United States was very small. The center of the fierce fighting is still in the Caucasus and Don River regions. On Sunday, the Soviet army launched an offensive with the assistance of tanks, but was repulsed in all places. As a result of the German infantry and tank columns launching counterattacks in many places, they must have gained some territory and annihilated several Soviet teams. The German side believes that the German army has defended well in the war on the central route of the Eastern Front. The Soviet army continues to attack the Rzhev base with large forces, but the German defense line has not been shaken so far. There are also fierce battles southeast of Lake Ilmen. German infantry and tank columns have destroyed 450 enemy armored vehicles in that area in the past six weeks. The Soviet army's reserve strength after the offensive at various points is quite strong, but the Soviet army often uses its old tactics, that is, launching an offensive with elite troops and leaving the more secondary troops as reserves.</p>
<h3>Tunisian Heavy Rains Turn Plains into Swamps; Only Fighting in the Foothills of the Atlas Mountains; Military Operations Elsewhere Obstructed</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency from the German Headquarters, 12th: This afternoon, the German war report stated that German and Italian aircraft were extremely active on the Libyan front. In Tunisia, enemy troops launched local attacks on our outposts, and fighting is still ongoing. Enemy artillery positions and concentrated trucks in northern Tunisia were bombed by our aircraft, and five enemy aircraft were shot down.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency from Berne, 11th: Heavy rains have continued on the Tunisian front today, and the plains have turned into swamps, like ponds, making it difficult for mechanized units to move. Except for fierce fighting in the foothills of the Atlas Mountains, where both armies continue fighting despite the muddy roads, military operations in other areas have been obstructed. Currently, the Axis forces' positions extend from Cape Negro west of Bizerte, passing 15 miles west of Mateur, and west of Medjez el Bab, crossing the Medjerda River, then circling westward to reach Bou Arada, and then turning south to reach the Hammamet area. Important coastal ports such as Bizerte, Sousse, and Sfax, as well as the fertile land of the Medjerda River valley, are mostly under the control of the Axis forces. This area is economically crucial, not only suitable for animal husbandry but also rich in fruit trees. In the vicinity of Tunis alone, there are one million olive trees.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency from Lisbon, 12th: According to the New York Affairs Weekly, the Allies have not yet decided on a strategy. Senior military authorities are likely discussing this issue, and a decision may be made within a few months. The United States will not take large-scale action before a strategic decision is made. The army and navy do not want to establish a separate air force to avoid handing over army and navy aircraft.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency from Berlin, 12th: Responsible parties also stated that German and British aircraft engaged in aerial combat on the Tunisian border on Sunday afternoon. German aircraft shot down one British fighter and one bomber each. German aircraft attacked the machinery depot of a train station in southern Tunisia, achieving significant results.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency from Berlin, 12th: On Sunday, German aircraft launched a surprise attack on British motorcades and tank convoys near Sedes on the Libyan front, destroying many British vehicles. British aircraft intercepted the attack, and two were shot down by German aircraft.</p>
<h3>Sweden's New Parliament Holds Its First Session; The King Reaffirms His Determination to Maintain Neutrality</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency from Stockholm, 12th: Today, King Gustaf of Sweden addressed the first session of the 1943 Parliament, stating that Sweden is determined to maintain neutrality. Although the international situation is becoming increasingly dangerous, Sweden's position remains unchanged. Sweden maintains friendly relations with foreign countries, but as long as the war continues, Sweden will continue to defend against all crises. Therefore, in recent months, necessary military measures have continued to be taken. It is hoped that the Swedish people will be cautious in their words and deeds and not give outsiders any doubt about Sweden's determination to maintain neutrality. Only by uniting can the nation's security be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency from Stockholm, 12th: During the first session of the new parliament today, Swedish Prime Minister Hansson declared to Social Democratic Party members that people from all walks of life in Sweden do not seem enthusiastic about the National Unity Association. However, this can still be considered an important part of Swiss political life during the New Year. People should consider post-war issues, but at present, maintaining Sweden's security is most important.</p>
<h3>The British Empire Will Eventually Become a Thing of the Past</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency from Rome, 11th: According to news from London, British Home Secretary Morrison stated in a speech in Newcastle that, regardless of the outcome of the current war, the British Empire will eventually become a thing of the past. He also said that Britain is prepared to pay a very high price for the aid from the US and Soviet allies.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Submits Budget Message to Congress; Military Spending Will Increase Sharply Next Year; Manpower Mobilization Will Become More Difficult</h3>
<p>Allied News Agency from Lisbon, 12th: According to news from Washington, President Roosevelt yesterday submitted a budget proposal for the next fiscal year to Congress, with total expenditures reaching ten billion US dollars, of which 1.6 billion dollars must be raised through increased taxes and savings. As Americans must make sacrifices in all aspects, President Roosevelt, after explaining the war expenses in detail, spoke about the manpower mobilization situation, saying that the U.S. manpower mobilization has now entered a more difficult stage. Most of the manpower needed next year will be taken from secondary jobs and those who have not yet been employed. As for the food problem, due to the needs of the U.S. and Allied forces, certain foods will inevitably be in short supply. The variety on the American menu must be further reduced, and the average per capita consumption of ordinary people will be limited to 500 yuan per year, which is about 25% less than in 1941.</p>
<p>One Hundred Billion Yuan for War</p>
<p>Central News Agency from Buenos Aires, 12th: According to a dispatch from Washington, President Roosevelt attended a joint session of the House and Senate at 1:00 PM on the 11th, submitting a budget message for the fiscal year 1943-1944, roughly as follows: (1) The budget proposal for 1943 represents the maximum scale of war effort, so the total expenditure is 109 billion US dollars, of which 100 billion US dollars is specifically for war purposes. As for the treasury's income, it is expected to increase by 16 billion US dollars through increased taxes or forced savings. Since the Pearl Harbor attack, the United States' monthly war expenses have reached 2 billion US dollars. Recently, it has exceeded 6 billion US dollars per month, so in the new fiscal year, it will reach 8 billion US dollars per month. (2) In order to carry out combat operations and in view of the reduction in unemployment, expenditures on relief efforts and other public works will be reduced. (3) In 1943, the military and munitions production sectors must mobilize another 6 million people. The government has put forward various opinions regarding the prices of agricultural products, so it is requested that the House and Senate remain united and form a national group.</p>
<p>U.S. Will Issue Large Amounts of Government Bonds</p>
<p>Central News Agency from Buenos Aires, 12th: According to a dispatch from Washington, President Roosevelt submitted to the House and Senate on the 11th that the total U.S. budget for the fiscal year 1943-1944 is 109 billion US dollars, of which 100 billion US dollars is for military expenditures. Compared with the total budget of President Roosevelt's budget message last year requesting the fiscal year 1943-1944, it is clear that military expenditures have increased sharply. This is an unprecedentedly large budget in American history. It is also estimated that the budget for the next fiscal year will be borne by the American people at 140 billion US dollars, accounting for 75% of the total, with an average burden of 819 US dollars per citizen. Therefore, the lives of the American people will be under even greater pressure. Roosevelt also explained that he would increase revenue by 16 billion US dollars through increased taxes and forced savings, but this would inevitably lead to a large increase in government bonds. The current total amount of U.S. government bonds is 113 billion US dollars, and it is expected that it will exceed 200 billion US dollars by the end of 1943. Although Roosevelt avoided explaining the use of military expenditures, informed sources speculate that the army's budget is about 62 billion US dollars and the navy's budget is about 22 billion US dollars.</p>
<p>Observations of Japanese Diplomatic Circles</p>
<p>Central News Agency from Tokyo, 12th: Regarding President Roosevelt's budget message to Congress on the 11th, people here generally do not pay much attention to it, thinking that any large budget proposal is not surprising. Their determination to defeat Britain and the United States has not been shaken by this. Diplomatic circles here made the following observations on Roosevelt's message: The amount of Roosevelt's budget this time is quite large, reaching three-quarters of the entire national income of the United States. We believe that there are many contradictions in it. Roosevelt boasted in the message about the increase in U.S. military production while warning of future difficulties in material and human resources. This proves that the unique method he adopted is to bluff. He also emphasized the meaning of the national war, which is a clear attempt by the U.S. government to further lower the living standards of its citizens. There are many people in the U.S. Congress who oppose Roosevelt's dictatorship. They also believe that many expenses in this huge budget should be thoroughly reviewed, which is a very interesting issue. He also explained that as a result of the implementation of this huge budget in the United States, government bonds will exceed 200 billion US dollars in 1944. They believe that this trend will inevitably bring about a crisis of inflation in the American economy. He repeatedly emphasized price controls in the message, ignoring the opposition of rural congressmen, which is quite puzzling. In previous messages, Roosevelt repeatedly emphasized the necessity of offense to the American people. Now, he emphasizes the necessity of increasing taxes. However, I wonder how the American people will bear the heavy pressure under this wartime situation. This is what we should pay attention to.</p>
<h3>Britain, America, and Chongqing Sign Agreements Separately, Renouncing Concessions and Extraterritorial Rights</h3>
<p>Allied News Agency from Berne, 12th: Britain and the United States also signed agreements with the Chongqing government yesterday, renouncing concessions and extraterritorial rights in China. The British-Chongqing treaty was signed in Chongqing by Song Ziwen, Foreign Minister of the Chongqing government, and Sir Horace James Seymour, the British Ambassador. The British Dominions signed agreements with the Chongqing authorities separately. The U.S.-Chongqing treaty was signed in Washington with the same content, stipulating that friendly, commercial, and navigation treaties will be negotiated within six months after the end of the war. It also declared the abandonment of the right to station troops in several places and establish a consular guard in Beijing granted by the Boxer Protocol, as well as the abandonment of the Shanghai International Settlement and the Amoy Kulangsu International Settlement.</p>
<p>Japan's Return of Concessions Makes Britain and America Deeply Uneasy</p>
<p>Central News Agency from Tokyo, 12th: According to a dispatch from the Allied News Agency's correspondent in Berne, Britain and the United States feel deeply uneasy about the signing of agreements between the Chinese and Japanese governments for the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. Therefore, on the 11th, they also announced the conclusion of an agreement with Chongqing to abolish extraterritorial rights. However, in reality, their forces have been completely driven out of the Greater East Asia region, so there is no object to abolish. The party with which they signed the agreement, Chongqing, is only a local government located in a remote border area. The so-called agreements of the British and American governments are actually of no value. Although the British government still insists that this agreement has considerable significance and that British-Chongqing relations have been redeveloped on an equal footing, the new agreement makes no mention of the return of concessions and Hong Kong. It is only a legalistic argument. Therefore, it is not difficult to infer from this that the British government is unwilling to treat Chongqing equally.</p>
<p>British, Soviet, and Chongqing Ambassadors</p>
<p>Meet with Hull for a Long Talk</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency from Lisbon, 12th: Washington: The British, Soviet, and Chongqing ambassadors to the United States held a lengthy meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Hull yesterday to discuss post-war reconstruction work. However, the content of their discussion was general in nature, only discussing major issues.</p>

<h3>New Movement Promotion Conference Opens in Nanjing Today</h3>

<h3>Japanese Hospital Ship Anchored in Yangon Harbor Bombed</h3>
<p>Central News Agency from Syonan, 12th: Three enemy aircraft bombed a Japanese hospital ship anchored in Yangon Harbor on the afternoon of the 4th of this month. At that time, the weather was extremely clear, and the ship was painted white in accordance with international law and had correct markings. Even from a long distance, it could be identified as a hospital ship. The aircraft dared to deliberately drop bombs on it. This kind of behavior violates international law and is intolerable by heaven. It is the same as the enemy submarine's illegal attack on a Japanese hospital ship in the South China Sea last January. This proves the true face of the United Kingdom and the United States, which advocate humanitarianism. Unimpeded navigation, no passenger deaths.</p>

<h3>The Difficulties of Guilin Manufacturers: Insufficient Raw Materials, Financial Difficulties, Delayed Transportation, and Labor Shortage</h3>
<p>Five years ago, that area was still a barren plain, but now, after the cultivation, tilling, and irrigation by thousands of workers, magnificent new shoots have sprouted from the gravel, and a new industrial zone is growing. The establishment of these hundreds of large and small mechanical iron factories has directly and indirectly contributed a lot of strength. They have a history of struggle in this arduous process. Today, they are aware of the current darkness and are facing some difficulties. These hardships are all serious practical problems.</p>
<p>Arduous Process</p>
<p>They all came from the coastal areas, each willing to move around to preserve their assets and develop industry, either relocating machinery for thousands of miles or starting anew here. They were firm in their beliefs and always able to stand on the production line and engage in development. Just looking at their achievements in recent years shames those wavering capitalists or merchants who hoard goods for speculation. Their energy is focused on researching and experimenting with various industrial substitutes. For example, Mr. Shen Yijia's research on internal combustion problems has discovered that anthracite can replace gasoline, bituminous coal can be used to make calcium carbide, and bituminous coal can be refined to make gasoline, solving many fuel supply problems. The manufacture of anthracite gas engines and the power engines manufactured by the China Power Engine Manufacturing Factory have also solved part of the power problem. Other examples include the改造 of machines, such as various factories engaging in the conversion of cars to charcoal engines and alcohol vehicles, which has also solved some transportation difficulties. Furthermore, the Junwu Machine Factory has designed and改造 agricultural tools, such as rice threshers, corn shellers, centrifuges (i.e., sugar making machines), sugarcane presses, Yang-style plows, cultivators, flour mills, vine cutters, and wooden water pumps. These are mostly made using a few raw materials and simple machinery, which has increased the work efficiency of agricultural production. These contributions are not small.</p>
<p>Although they suffer from the difficulty of obtaining raw materials, they are not discouraged by this. They try to collect raw materials, utilize waste materials, and use them sparingly. They say: "For example, if copper is the most scarce, then we will not stick to the old rules of the past that it must be copper. Within the possible range, we can reduce the use of copper and replace it with better iron. Although this method shortens the life of the machine, if a copper machine can be used for ten years, while an iron machine can only be used for five years, the lifespan is only half as long. However, we only need to use these machines for five years, because after five years, copper and iron production and various situations will change. At that time, we will use all-copper to制造 again."</p>
<p>Many things show that the monopolistic concept of "competitors are enemies" that factories used to want to overwhelm other people's production has made progress and changed. This can be seen in their work of mutual cooperation and mutual adjustment and borrowing of raw materials. They deeply feel that individual strength is weak today, and problems cannot be solved without collective strength. There are still many difficulties that need to be solved in front of them, but they are beyond their ability to overcome.</p>
<p>Steel Problem</p>
<p>Steel is the main raw material for industry, and the hundreds of factories are currently frowning and planning how to obtain these raw materials. They are just worried. According to what they know, steel production is so scarce, and the steelmaking and ironmaking industry has not yet achieved large-scale results, but maintaining the status quo is not a problem.</p>
<p>Although the ×× Steel Plant has a monthly production of more than 100 tons, the factories along the Xiang-Gui line need more than 300 tons per month, and private factories cannot expect to share the benefits. Therefore, many factories are trying to find their own ways. The China Power Engine Manufacturing Factory is currently engaged in self-sufficiency in raw materials. Mr. Tang Zhongping, the factory director, said: "Currently, we still need to plan for what we can do ourselves. Hoping often disappoints people. Now there is a bad phenomenon, that is, on the one hand, factories urgently need steel, but on the other hand, no one cherishes these raw materials. The phenomenon of waste and abandonment can often be seen. Many public things would rather be abandoned on the road than be taken and used by those who need them."</p>
<p>The steel needed by civilian factories in Guilin can originally be purchased freely from the Hunan ×× Steel Plant, but there are three difficulties: (1) The full price must be paid in advance when ordering; (2) There must be a gap of more than six months between the time of ordering and the time of delivery; (3) Transportation is difficult. These three difficulties not only make it difficult for small private factories, but also make well-funded manufacturers feel helpless. Taking the first and second difficulties as an example, the current price must be paid in full when ordering, and the goods will not be delivered until half a year after the money is paid. Needless to say, factories with a shortage of capital, even those with considerable capital, may not be able to do it, not to mention the biggest difficulty - transportation, which is even more difficult to solve! Therefore, going to Hunan to purchase raw materials can almost be said to be a dead end.</p>
<p>Urgent Need for Power</p>
<p>The problem of power supply is as important to them as the need for raw materials, and at the same time, they cannot get any help as with raw materials. The power required by the factories in the ×× industrial zone is mostly supplied by the Xiang-Gui Railway Power Plant, and the larger factories generate their own electricity. Everyone feels that it is not enough and considers it a rather serious problem.</p>
<p>The Guangxi Power Plant, which is responsible for supplying electricity, naturally also has its own difficulties in meeting the demand, but it is said that the power plant still has two diesel engines equipped with charcoal stoves that have not been started. In addition, the Xiang-Gui Railway Bureau has added a new power plant, the purpose of which is to supply power to a number of factories. The plant has not yet generated electricity, and the amount requested by people who want to pre-order electricity has already exceeded the amount that the click can supply by more than double. This shows the urgent need for power in Guilin's factories. In the future, how to limit the waste of electricity use in Guilin, how to rationally allocate it to various factories that need power, and how to strengthen power equipment are all the expectations of general civilian factories and also the problems that the power plant authorities should pay close attention to.</p>
<p>Financial Difficulties</p>
<p>The working capital of private factories is gradually becoming sluggish, precisely because of the difficulty of purchasing raw materials and the difficulty of transportation, the impact of rising prices, etc. A factory owner who often has 300,000 yuan of working capital said with great emotion: "Before the war, we opened a factory in Wuxi, and 30,000 to 40,000 yuan of working capital was enough to turn around. Now it is too different. At present, it is often not easy to have 300,000 to 400,000 yuan in cash as turnover. For example, if you want to go to Hunan to order a batch of goods, let's not say much, buy more than ten tons of iron, on average, you have to pay more than 100,000 yuan in advance. Coal also costs 4,000 to 5,000 yuan per ton, and buying 40 to 50 tons at a time costs more than 200,000 yuan. The 300,000 to 400,000 yuan in cash can only be used to pre-order one payment for goods. It is not easy to turn around for other uses. And it takes half a year to order once before it can be obtained, and then it can be exchanged for cash after engaging in production." A factory with 300,000 yuan of working capital has such difficulties, and it is even more conceivable for others. Applying for a loan from a bank? First, it is not easy to get it; second, banks are not interested in developing industry at all.</p>
<p>Transportation Workers</p>
<p>In addition to the difficulty in finding vehicles, there are also difficulties in the inspections at checkpoints. According to Mr. Shen Yijia: In addition to the need for steel in his factory, because he also has to engage in centralized research and experimentation, he needs some chemical drugs, and these are mostly foreign goods. Sometimes he has to buy them elsewhere. However, after buying the goods and finding a car, it is still empty, because on the way, the inspection checkpoints along the way either say that materials are flowing back or that industrial raw materials are being transported "outward", and the inspection and detention are even more difficult.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is a shortage of technicians. Although the number of skilled workers has increased a lot after the war, the scope of industrial production has also increased and expanded, and new factories are being added everywhere, needing workers. And a worker needs at least four or five years of work experience to be considered skilled. The rate of increase in new factories is faster than the supply of workers, which has become a phenomenon of many factories and few workers. Those new factories that cannot find workers will find them from old factories. Everyone bids against each other in the open and snatches in the dark, causing those workers to waver often. This unstable life makes it impossible to improve the efficiency of workers, which invisibly affects the reduction of production.</p>
<p>There were originally many Hong Kong and Kowloon　national technicians, but not many participated in the work of private factories. Some of them left because the factory equipment here was incomplete, life was hard, and wages were low, and they could not settle down. (Sent on December 15, 1942)</p>

<h3>Increasing Number of Corpses on the Frozen Roads due to Cold Weather, Winter Relief Scope Urgently Needs to be Expanded, Municipal Government Prepares 2 Million Yuan for Relief, Relief Committee Distributes 3,000 Sets of Winter Clothing</h3>
<p>For the 31st Winter Relief in Shanghai Special Municipality, the Municipal Government authorities decided to expand the event, with a planned relief fund of 2 million yuan. The Municipal Government allocated 500,000 yuan, and the remaining 1.5 million yuan needs to be raised from all walks of life in Shanghai. However, the amount is very large and needs to be raised from various sources. Ling Xianwen, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, told the Central News Agency reporter yesterday that the draft preparation plan has been formulated, and the fundraising methods are divided into three categories: (1) Group donations, with various trade associations in the city donating separately; (2) Individual donations, with the Shanghai Special Municipality 31st Annual Winter Relief Fundraising Committee organized by the Municipal Government issuing letters to solicit donations from well-known philanthropists in society;</p>
<p>Charitable Fundraising</p>
<p>(3) Holding charitable competitions to raise funds: (A) Horse Racing Grand Champagne, entrusted to the Horse Racing General Association to organize. The Grand Champagne competition will be held on the 30th of this month. Ten percent of the fees collected will be used for the Horse Racing Hall's expenses, 80% will be used as prize money, and the remaining amount will be divided into three parts for the 工部局 charitable donations, friendly countries' charitable organization expenses, and winter relief; (B) A charitable football match will be held on the 17th of this month, inviting the Chinese and Western Leagues to compete at Jiaozhou Park; (C) Peking Opera charitable performances will be held for three days from the 25th to the 27th of this month, taking turns on the Tianchan Stage, the Grand Stage, and the Renewal Stage, inviting famous performers from all over Shanghai to perform voluntary plays. Tickets are divided into several types: 100 yuan, 50 yuan, 20 yuan, 15 yuan, and 10 yuan. All income, except for expenses, will be used for winter relief funds; (D) Fundraising through broadcasting, inviting famous artists from all over Shanghai in Shenqu Opera, Cantonese Opera, Yue Opera, and comedy. The radio station and time are still under negotiation; (E) Fundraising through storytelling, inviting storytellers and commentators from all over Shanghai to perform together, and using the ticket income to supplement the relief funds. However, the time and venue are also under negotiation.</p>
<p>Distributing Relief Clothing</p>
<p>Currently, winter relief work in Shanghai is booming. Under this freezing weather, the Shanghai Branch of the Central Relief Committee's expenses for this winter relief are set at 450,000 yuan. In addition to subsidizing groups and self-run porridge factories and shelters, it has now also decided to start clothing relief.</p>
<p>Distribution Date and Location</p>
<p>On the 15th, 16th, and 17th of this month, from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm, the branch will distribute cotton clothing at 1361 Xinzha Road. Staff will be sent in advance to carry clothing tickets and distribute them to homeless beggars on the roads, ordering them to go to the branch on time to receive the clothing. When issuing tickets, pay special attention to beggars with thin and tattered clothes, record their names, genders, ages, origins, and whether they have addresses. When they come to receive the clothing on time, the supervisors will carefully verify and distribute it. If there is anything suspicious, it will be deducted. It is reported that the branch will distribute about 3,000 sets of clothing this time. In view of the dense population of urban poor, the distribution is concentrated, so that a part of the extremely poor who call for being frozen to death on the streets can have clothes and feel the　gratitude, and a letter is sent to the Shanghai Special Municipal Government to send personnel to supervise the distribution at the branch at that time.</p>
<p>Three Routes for Distributing Tickets, Authorities Supervise Distribution</p>
<p>The detailed clothing distribution methods are as follows: (1) Distribution method: distribute tickets in advance and receive clothing within a time limit; (2) Ticket distribution routes: divided into three routes. The first route starts from Xiaoshadu Road to Robison Road, turns onto Putuo Road, passes through McGonagall Road, and folds into Wuding Road. The second route starts from Xinzha Road, turns onto Hart Road, folds into Hager Road to Hongqiao, then turns to Xujiahui and returns from Fuli Road via Albert Road. The third route starts from Nicheng Bridge, passes through Yu Qiaqing Road, the Great World, to Nanyang Bridge, and then to Huanghe Road; (3) Each route has one staff member and one worker; (4) A letter is sent to the Shanghai Special Municipal Government to send personnel to supervise the distribution at the meeting at that time, and a letter is sent to the Jing'an Temple Police Station to send arresters to maintain order on a daily basis during the clothing distribution period.</p>
<p>Countless Frozen Corpses, Too Horrible to Bear</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 11th), the weather in the city was extremely cold, with temperatures below freezing, which was rare in recent years. The piercing wind and freezing water caused the poor who were stranded and sleeping on the streets to freeze to death everywhere, which was truly unbearable to see. According to inquiries made by the Central News Agency reporter to various corpse collection charities, the Tongren Fuyuan Hall collected 13 large corpses and 15 children's corpses in the South City. The French Concession branch collected 24 large corpses and more than 20 small corpses. A hundred people died in one night of piercing wind, which is truly a tragic situation in the world. According to the person in charge of Tongren Fuyuan Hall, "The rumor that the corpses were wrapped in straw nests due to the depletion of wooden boards for transporting corpses is unfounded. The current stock of wooden boards is still sufficient, but it is true that two nameless corpses are placed in one coffin. At the same time, the funds of various charities are currently in short supply, and it is hoped that all sectors of society will contribute and help each other."</p>
<h3>Warehouse Industry Will Increase Warehouse Rent, Goods Expiring in the Future Must Be Cleared Out, Fees Will Be Doubled for Extension</h3>
<p>The city's various warehouses, storage facilities, and cold storage facilities, after an agreement with the industry investigation agency the other day (the 11th), decided to increase storage fees, and also give a considerable increase to the porter's carrying fees. At the same time, it was also decided that goods that have expired must be cleared out on schedule. If an extension is required, the fees will be doubled.</p>
<h3>Authorities Reconsidering Flour Exchange for Wheat Products</h3>
<p>After the Noodles Industry and Cookie, Noodle and Fried Dough Stick Industry Associations submitted five opinions to the 工部局 authorities, requesting a change in the method of exchanging flour for wheat products, a senior official of the 工部局 has already investigated and expressed that he will submit it to the 工部局's board meeting on Thursday for discussion. According to the two industries, since the two industry associations notified members to implement the method of exchanging flour for wheat products, the business of various wheat product stores has plummeted. If this continues, the future of the two industries will be unimaginable. Therefore, the Noodles Industry sent Wang Fuxin and others as representatives to the flour stock again yesterday to make requests, asking for normal allocations.</p>
<h3>After the Implementation of the New Grain Control Measures, Household Rice Will Be Increased Again, Ensuring that It Meets the Quantity Needed by Each Person</h3>
<p>In order to regulate the people's food and coordinate the distribution of grain, the authorities implemented new control measures. Starting from the 13th, it was announced that the transportation of major food grains without official permission is strictly prohibited, and hoarding and black market transactions will be cracked down on. Violators will be severely punished. Yesterday, it was learned from the rice industry that after the authorities adopted the new control measures, they have negotiated a cooperative method for regulating the food of Shanghai residents. In addition to being responsible for dredging the source, a sufficient allocation will be given to meet legitimate needs. Regarding the quantity of grain allocated per capita in this period, it was decided to increase it to 2.5 to 3 liters, and flour will continue to be allocated. The contracted rice shops in the 界内 have been approved to receive purchase orders from the Grain Office on the 14th, pay and pick up the goods. The actual allocation quantity will be clear at that time.</p>
<p>French Concession Adopts the Same Steps</p>
<p>The French Concession authorities urge the public to pay attention to the announcement issued by the Japanese Army and Navy authorities on January 12 regarding the prohibition of secret transactions of major food grains. Now the French authorities are fully cooperating with the Japanese authorities and have decided to take various effective measures to prevent the secret transactions of these food grains and ensure the fairness of their distribution. The authorities firmly believe that in the current situation, they will be able to obtain the full cooperation of the public to facilitate the　implementation of various measures taken in the future and achieve the goal of distributing the people's food in the best possible condition. Those who do not respect the various measures announced thereafter will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Nanhui District Commissioner Replaced by City Government Appointee, Zhang Baotang Resigns, Li Bingyi Succeeds</h3>
<p>Zhang Baotang, Commissioner of the Nanhui Special District Office, has submitted his resignation due to illness and has been approved. The vacancy has been filled by Li Bingyi, appointed by the Municipal Government, to handle the handover in the short term.</p>
<h3>The Newspaper's Fourth Scholarship Program Receives Encouragement from All Sectors, The Society's Expectations are High, and Colleagues Dare Not Fail</h3>
<p>Applications for the fourth Shen Bao Reader Scholarship will begin on the 15th. After the news was announced, the newspaper received letters from readers yesterday, offering much encouragement, and Mr. Yin and Chuneng Middle School donated free places. Details of each situation are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Unnamed Elderly</p>
<p>The unnamed elderly person is enthusiastic about helping students. He donated a large amount of money when the newspaper's reader scholarship was founded, and has continued to donate and raise funds in successive sessions, amounting to more than 10,000 yuan. Yesterday, the Dehua Primary School sent a letter stating that the school had recently been instructed by the unnamed elderly person to set up two free places and four half-fee places, and asked the newspaper's reader scholarship association to introduce outstanding students from poor families to the school. The elderly person once wrote to the newspaper,　"I am nearly sixty years old and entering my twilight years. I run a small business and my ability is weak.　I am willing to do my best and make a small contribution." His sincerity and enthusiasm are worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>Chuneng Middle School</p>
<p>Yesterday, Chuneng Middle School, a private school in Shanghai located at 770 Lane, Niuzhuang Road, sent a letter saying, "Your newspaper's scholarship program benefits poor students and is deeply admired. Our school is willing to donate three high school and three junior high school places, waiving tuition and miscellaneous fees, to express our support." The school will hold a new student exam on the 24th. The school's consideration for poor students and its willingness to help students is worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>Guidance from Educational Pioneers in the Previous Scholarship</p>
<p>When the previous scholarship was held, it was during the oppressive heat of summer. The newspaper's colleagues served under the guidance of various sectors and the scholarship committee, which was their duty. The committee members, such as Mr. Shen Siliang, President of St. John's University, Mr. Chen Qingshi of the 工部局 Chinese Education Department, Mr. Lu Gaoyi, General Manager of the World Book Company, Ms. Nie Lingyu, Principal of the 工部局 Girls' School, and Mr. Zhao Zongyu, Principal of the Second Chinese Vocational School, were all pioneers in the education field and have long been respected by society. They came to the newspaper in the scorching heat to attend meetings and instruct the progress of the work, so that colleagues could avoid failure. The gentlemen's benefits to the scholars were commendable. In addition, Mr. Ding Guangxun and Ms. Xu Xuehai of the YMCA hosted the previous exam, working tirelessly, so that the newspaper could live up to the trust of the donors. This is what colleagues want to tell the donors in addition to gratitude.</p>
<p>The Enthusiasm of the Donors in Previous Sessions is Exemplary</p>
<p>Since the three sessions, all sectors have enthusiastically donated hundreds of thousands of dollars. Although the donations vary in amount, the enthusiasm　is the same. As the fourth scholarship begins, we would like to recall it, hoping to make the students who receive help more vigilant about their studies. Due to space limitations, only those who can be used as models are mentioned below. Please understand if there are any omissions. (1) The Lun Society has donated a total of more than 40,000 yuan; (2) The unnamed elderly person has continued to donate in each session; (3) The owner of Kuzhai donated 5,000 yuan of a paper mill's remuneration; (4) A society transferred its foundation income and donated 8,000 yuan; (5) Mr. Ding Fubao transferred his birthday gifts to help students; (6) Mrs. Yao Zhao's will instructed to save funeral expenses to help students; (7) Chen Yanyitang generously donated 15,000 yuan; (8) Mr. Wang Juerong donated regularly; (9) The servant Mr. Shen Fengbiao donated monthly. All of these are examples for society. There are many other donations from all sectors. The newspaper is currently editing them to provide credit.</p>
<h3>City Area Prohibited Radios Must be Registered Again, Apply to the Police Station in Charge, Deadline is the 18th of this Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government has been actively handling the radio registration matters since last year. Now that the regulations on banning prohibited radios have been announced by the government and implemented by the Municipal Government's announcement, the Municipal Government is urging again. The methods are as follows: (1) All radios with more than seven tubes, regardless of whether they have shortwave, are regarded as prohibited machines. Citizens must report again, regardless of whether they have previously registered with the Municipal Government　Police Station. From now until the 18th of this month, they must go to the police station in charge, fill in the registration according to the prescribed form. After the deadline, the police and military authorities will investigate. Those who have not registered will be punished by military law once discovered. It is hoped that citizens will pay close attention to avoid　criminal punishment; (2) If radios with seven or fewer tubes have shortwave, they should follow the Municipal Government's Shanghai Municipal Order No. 51685 and go to the designated store to remove the shortwave part; (3) If institutions in the city area must use prohibited radios, they must go to the fifth section of the Municipal Government to fill in the application for use and wait for approval; (4) Those who have applied to the fifth section of the Municipal Government to retain the use of prohibited radios are not allowed to use the shortwave part before obtaining permission.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government and Concession Authorities Set Up Vagrant Work Training Center, Xin Puyu Hall in the South City Agrees to Lend Part of the Remaining Houses</h3>
<p>The standard of living is increasing day by day, so that the beggars on the streets are everywhere, which is unbearable to see. The Municipal Government and the two Concession authorities, in view of this, could not bear to stand idly by. Therefore, after several negotiations, 3 million yuan of funds were raised, which was divided and borne by the three authorities, and entrusted to Li Sihao, who is in charge of the Shanghai Branch of the World Red Swastika Society of China, to set up a vagrant work training center, collect vagrants, and teach them work, with the expectation of learning skills and becoming self-reliant. The issue of the location was once shelved. Now it has been agreed that Xin Puyu Hall in the South City agrees to lend part of the houses as a shelter, so everything is ready and can start operating from today.</p>

<h3>Intensifying the Handling of Enemy Property, Application Period Extended to February 9th</h3>
<p>Most of the enemy properties in the city are actually owned by Chinese people. In the past, general real estate merchants and industrial and commercial entrepreneurs in Shanghai often liked to hang foreign business signs. After the outbreak of the Pacific War and the change in the situation in the Concession, these Chinese properties with foreign business signs were　sealed with　British and American property. After sealing, if the owner can provide formal evidence or a considerable contract to prove that it is not? property, he can request the authorities to unseal it. However, since last year, only one-fifth of the Chinese properties in the city that have requested the lifting of the enemy property disposal have been unsealed. It is known that after the country joined the war, the enemy property issue needs to be resolved urgently. Therefore, the authorities have issued another notice stating that all enemy properties that need to apply for lifting must complete the request before February 9th, and there will be no further extension.</p>
<h3>Various Cultural Groups Support the War</h3>
<p>Anti-British and American Association Issues an Appeal to the People</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-British and American Association, since the National Government issued its declaration of war against Britain and America on the 9th of this month, immediately expressed its determination to lead the people in continuing its efforts against Britain and America. The association's directors, Yuan Lvdeng, Wen Lanting, and others, sent a telegram to Chairman Wang, expressing their support for the war. They also followed the Propaganda Department's instructions, printing and distributing slogans throughout the city in support of the government's entry into the war, and issuing an appeal to the people, elaborating on the significance of the declaration of war against Britain and America. The main points of the association's appeal to the people are as follows: "For over a hundred years, China has suffered countless acts of aggression from Britain and America. Now that the National Government has officially declared war on Britain and America, China can not only pursue internal rejuvenation but also enhance its international standing. The ultimate goal of entering the war is to share weal and woe with friendly nations and fight shoulder to shoulder. Our association has been engaged in the anti-British and American movement on behalf of the Chinese people for more than a year. Now, under the call to join the war, we are determined to mobilize the people with all our strength and work diligently. We sincerely hope that all compatriots will recognize that the enemies of East Asia, the British and American imperialists, must be overthrown with all our strength to complete China's rejuvenation and the liberation of the Asian nations."</p>
<p>Cultural Circles Hold a Symposium on Supporting the War</p>
<p>The Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office convened a symposium of cultural circles yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at its premises. Several dozen people from Shanghai's cultural circles, including Xu Liqiu and Liu Yu, attended. Secretary Ma Zongyao and Jiang Ke presided over the meeting. During the session, sincere support was expressed for the government's resolute entry into the war, and opinions were expressed on the future mission of the cultural circles. The general consensus was that cultural figures should adopt a frontline spirit, take up their pens, take on the responsibility of correcting people's erroneous thinking, and explain the sacred significance of the war to the people. Furthermore, they could use plays to expose the ambitions of the British and Americans and their oppression of East Asian nations. The mission of cultural figures is in fact even more important than that of soldiers on the front lines, etc. Later, it was resolved to send a telegram to Chairman Wang to express respect and support for the war. The telegram read: "To Chairman Wang of the National Government: After prolonged oppression, the nations of East Asia are bound to rise again. The Greater East Asia War is a historical turning point for the liberation of East Asia and the revival of China. Your Excellency, with insightful foresight, has resolutely led us into the war. We pledge our utmost sincerity to support the government, and under the guidance of the sole leader, to exert our utmost loyalty, to promote national policies, and to inspire the people to unite in their hatred of the enemy, so as to fulfill the responsibility of every citizen to save the nation. We are determined to work together to achieve the final victory of the Co-Prosperity Sphere and to implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism, thereby laying the foundation for the peace and prosperity of hundreds of millions of people of the same race. We send this telegram with the highest respect and earnest prayers. The Shanghai Cultural Circles Symposium in support of the government's entry into the war bows in reverence."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Qingxiang Branch Strictly Prohibits Troops from Demanding Supplies</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Qingxiang Branch has previously instructed all teams in the Qingxiang areas not to demand any supplies from the local population. However, according to confidential reports, some unscrupulous elements, abusing their authority, are still demanding supplies from local areas, such as hiring boats and vehicles, procuring food, etc. Furthermore, if their demands are not met, they even arrest and severely flog people. Military personnel are supposed to defend the local area and protect the peace and security of the people, yet they dare to disregard the law, which is utterly deplorable. Therefore, we hereby reiterate the previous order: if any teams in the Qingxiang areas dare to disobey the order again and demand supplies from local areas, once verified or reported by victims, they will be strictly dealt with according to the law, as a warning to others.</p>
<h3>Publication Announcement of the Revived Monthly Magazine</h3>

<h3>Strengthening Financial Strategies After Joining the War</h3>
<h3>Adjustments to Financial Measures are Crucial</h3>
<h3>Economic Policies in Central China are Poised for Reform</h3>
<p>Authoritative sources reveal that now that our country's participation in the war has become a reality, the highest authorities are further studying how to strengthen the financial foundation. If the financial foundation cannot be strengthened, political power cannot be exercised. In terms of stabilizing finances and strengthening the gold standard, the authorities will make every effort to implement the following points in the future:</p>
<p>Ensuring Currency Value and Increasing Supply</p>
<p>(1) Regarding currency, the authorities' future policy for reserve certificates will be to increase their value, expand circulation, strengthen their financial network, and prevent their inflation. (2) Regarding price policy, local conditions should be taken into account to strengthen Chinese activities, and to establish relevant connections between resource procurement and distribution control agencies. (3) Developing above-ground and underground resources to ensure the supply of materials, with cotton, rice, and miscellaneous grains being the main agricultural products of Central China. The authorities will strive to increase the supply of these agricultural products. At the same time, it is necessary to promote the exchange of materials between Shanghai and various peaceful areas, and to strive for the revival of light industry. (4) Regarding trade, confirm the independence of Central China and seek to rationalize trade between Central China and Japan, North China, South China, and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Central China's Economy is Bound to Change</p>
<p>Furthermore, after China's entry into the war, the current economic policies in Central China must be comprehensively changed. (1) The current restrictions on the transfer of materials in Shanghai and various peaceful areas are implemented due to military needs and other factors. Now that the times have changed, these restrictions must be eased. (2) The inland economy should be guided towards self-sufficiency. (3) It has long been advocated that Chinese should be appointed as much as possible to the procurement agencies for distribution. Now that the time has come, it should be put into practice. (4) The connection between procurement and distribution agencies has always lacked organization, and this should be corrected in the future. (5) Since the Pacific War, the distribution of tobacco, matches, and candles to various peaceful areas has been limited. In the future, efforts should be made to rationalize the distribution.</p>

<h3>Regulations on Interbank Lending Set Maximum Amounts</h3>
<h3>Evaluation Discounts for Collateral</h3>
<h3>Banks Have Settled Accounts and Resumed Mortgage Lending</h3>
<p>The date for the general year-end closing for all businesses in the 31st year of the Republic of China has been decided as February 5th to 8th. Various businesses have been preparing accordingly, such as collecting outstanding customer accounts and transferring funds to repay overdrafts from various money houses. During this closing period, all transactions are limited to cash. Money houses have notified all their customers that previous overdrafts must be fully repaid before the end of the closing period. The methods for handling business before and after the general closing period will be submitted to the next standing committee meeting of the association for resolution. The time for the exchange of bills and all collection and return of bills will be decided by the Bank Joint Reserve Association and the Money Industry Joint Reserve.</p>
<p>Interbank Lending</p>
<p>After the Bank United Reserve Association established cooperation for interbank lending with member banks and money houses, it was stipulated that if banks and money houses need it for internal business, they may provide collateral to apply for interbank lending from the Bank United Association and the Money Reserve. The amount of interbank lending shall not exceed the total amount of the bank or money house's paid-up capital and public reserve. It is also stipulated that the evaluation discount for interbank lending collateral shall be 70% for government securities, 60% for Chinese commercial company bonds, 70% for Chinese commercial company stocks, but the evaluation amount shall not exceed the face value. Real estate in the concessions is discounted to 50% of the evaluation, and goods are discounted to 60% of the evaluation. However, the selection of goods is extremely cautious to avoid fueling speculation and hoarding.</p>
<p>Accommodating Loans</p>
<p>Since the banks and money houses have obtained interbank lending from the preparatory agencies, their own foundations have become more solid. In order to support the proper development of various industries, they are allowed to accommodate outstanding overdrafts for various customers. If reliable collateral such as goods is provided, mortgage loans may be granted, and credit loans may be granted at the discretion of each industry's credit. At the same time, now that the banks' annual closing period has passed, they have all resumed accepting mortgage loans from various industries.</p>
<h3>Passengers Traveling to Ningbo Must Present Citizen ID Cards to Purchase Tickets, Implemented on the 10th</h3>
<p>Now that the Lunar New Year is approaching, the number of passengers traveling to Ningbo from this port is increasing daily, especially those taking the Ningshao and Mingdou No. 2 liners. It is reported that the ticket offices of these two liners, in order to avoid crowding when passengers purchase tickets, will, starting from the 10th of this month, require all passengers to first present their citizen ID cards or travel permits to reserve ship dates. After the company issues a reserved ship date certificate, stating the payment date, only after payment on that date can they exchange it for a ticket. Those without the above-mentioned documents will not be allowed to purchase tickets.</p>
<h3>French Consul General Stipulates Holidays for Japanese Festivals</h3>
<p>French Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Mary, issued an order stipulating that the French Municipal Council will henceforth take holidays to celebrate all important Japanese festivals. This fact opens a new era in the history of the French Concession. It is understood that the Japanese festivals stipulated for holidays include: (1) February 11, Japanese National Foundation Day; (2) April 29, the Emperor's Birthday; (3) The Emperor Meiji's Birthday, Tencho-setsu. In addition, holidays will still be observed for Chinese festivals as usual. Catholic memorial festivals such as June 4 and November 1 will also be observed as holidays.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese National Policy Companies to Be Adjusted Soon, President of the Revitalization Company to Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since the National Government's entry into the war, in order to respond to the development of the new situation, based on the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty, the Sino-Japanese joint national policy companies will be adjusted. President Kodama of the Revitalization Company will come to Shanghai on the 15th to discuss this issue. The relevant companies of the Revitalization Company are also preparing. The direct targets of the adjustment are the Central China Silk, Central China Salt Industry, Central China Urban Automobile, and Central China Water Companies. The fundamental principles of the specific adjustment are roughly as follows: (1) The targets of adjustment, except for companies related to vehicle affairs, will be carried out gradually for general companies related to people's needs. (2) Increase the shares of the Chinese side in joint venture companies, increase Chinese staff, and concretely manage the company's operations. (3) The adjustment of national policy companies is not only aimed at the type of occupation, but also considers other conditions and adjustments based on other regional distinctions.</p>

<h3>Government Bonds Show Signs of Recovery</h3>
<p>The government bond market yesterday was still confusing. The market situation was weak first and then strong. Generally, the positions of various bondholders are gradually being settled, so selling is not as urgent as before. The situation has eased and the trend may gradually resolve upward. The price of the inner type was only 8 yuan at the beginning, and then gradually rose to 8 yuan and 89 cents.

<p>The cotton fabric market has temporarily come to a standstill since the authorities arrested black market merchants the other day. All parties are also rushing to close their accounts at the end of the old lunar year, so there have been no openings. Mill order prices have all fallen, but spot goods remain firm. As for cotton fabric movement certificates, it is heard that the procedures for applying for them have begun.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics Trade Rarely</h3>
<p>Woolen fabric transactions are rare, partly because the inventory is gradually thinning, making it difficult to replenish sold items, and sellers are unwilling to sell; partly because shipping is not smooth, making delivery inconvenient; partly because scarcity makes things expensive, and prices continue to rise along with surcharges; and partly because actual sales are weakening and the end of the year is approaching, reducing buyers. Yesterday, Golden Bear brand rainproof cloth was quoted at 27 yuan per yard, Great Ming brand at 24 yuan, Ape Man Tarzan at 22 yuan, 470 French style lining was sold for 6.5 yuan, Taiji Map gray soft lining was 7.8 yuan, Mingfeng soft lining was 7.5 yuan, 401 yuan horse pants were 290 yuan, 1 to 28 grassy green horse pants were 350 yuan, 456 spring flower was 150 yuan, and 135 was 225 yuan.</p>
<h3>Amidst Control Rumors, Grains Are Mostly Sold for Cash</h3>
<p>Yesterday, grain trading was still good, but the market still lacked luster. Due to rumors of control, retail investors all wanted to sell their goods for cash, so prices were slightly soft. It is calculated that 40 bags of Chongming sandy yellow beans were priced at 342 yuan to 340 yuan, and substandard goods were 325 yuan. Also, 20 bags of new sandy red beans were priced at 338 yuan.

It is heard that the production price of miscellaneous road goods has risen slightly, and the number of arrivals is not large. The Shanghai market is also slightly tight.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Road Yuan Prices Trend</h3>
<p>The price of large-style miscellaneous road "yuan" coins has slightly loosened as the recent quoted prices are slightly loose, but the market prices have not insisted. Yesterday, the market fell slightly again, and there are still many goods in the hands of non-industry players, so it is not easy to recover for the time being, and the trend is smooth and soft.</p>
<h3>Superior Dried Longan Continues to Loosen</h3>
<p>Superior dried longan, it is found that there are still many goods in the hands of non-industry players, and there have been new openings recently, and the price has been gradually loosening.

<h3>Few Transactions in Red and Green Tea</h3>
<p>Tea market transactions are sporadic, and market prices are stagnant as always.

At the same time, the tea company also purchased 5 boxes of black tea, with a price of 570 yuan per load, all sold by a tea shop.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Market Prices Fall</h3>
<p>The cigarette market has softened in momentum, as general hoarders lack special news, resulting in stillness and inaction.

<h3>A New Outlet for Medicinal Gorgon Fruit</h3>
<p>The production price of medicinal gorgon fruit is still high, and the difference between the production area and Shanghai is still inverted, so industry players lack trial runs. It is found that the old goods here, with Cantonese sales stagnant and the market depressed, but this item can be used as a grain, and the inland makes gorgon fruit cakes with it, which taste good, so the local porridge factory has tried a batch, the price is smaller than Zhanglu, and it is boiled with porridge, which is very delicious and very cost-effective.</p>
<h3>Soap Prices Are Repeatedly Seen High</h3>
<p>In the daily necessities market, the prices of soap have been rumored to have price limits and rationing, but buyers are still willing to buy, and prices have repeatedly hit new highs, so very few transactions have been concluded.

<h3>Hobbies and Life</h3>
<p>—Hai Lin</p>
<p>After reading "A Type of Social Illness - Playing Mahjong" in this publication, indeed, this is a bad "hobby," and trying to cure it is not an easy task. "Prohibition of gambling" is certainly a positive method, but people will try every means to commit "gambling," although they have never heard of someone "starting a family by gambling," but "gambling," wanting to win money is still a secondary purpose. The main purpose is that people pursue hobbies after they are free, so those with weak will develop a gambling habit.</p>
<p>Researching this level can find that everyone has its hobbies, and all are regarded as a second life-like attention, so here is divided into good hobbies and bad hobbies.</p>
<p>There are many young people in society who learn to smoke before they can make money, and even run to dance halls, gambling halls... gradually embarking on the road of depravity. Although the profit-only bosses who open these paper-drunk gold fans places have to bear most of the responsibility, one aspect of the responsibility has to be borne by themselves. Some people are harmed by "playing along," thinking that "doing it occasionally" will not have any danger, but which one is not "a false step will cause eternal regret?"</p>
<p>Some young people loudly shout "boredom," yes, everyone feels bored when they are young, but they cannot take it as a plausible reason to seek comfort in stimulation, and the result is always getting deeper and deeper, so we should conversely use beneficial hobbies to break this boredom. Do not willfully embark on the path of destruction.</p>
<p>The environment cannot satisfy our desire for knowledge, which is a very good expression of young people's enthusiasm. Since this is the case, then we should use our own strength to pursue a rational and favorite aspect, and what we get in this aspect is often the most valuable and valuable part.</p>
<p>Young people should have good hobbies, for example, those who like to study books can often go to the library, which is a treasure house of knowledge, and I am afraid that you will not use it. I remember that when Sun Yat-sen was young, he was so poor that he was at a loss. Fortunately, many revolutionary comrades raised a considerable amount of money from overseas Chinese to take care of Sun Yat-sen's life, but who knew that he did not leave a penny and spent it all on buying books to read. As a result, life was still extraordinarily difficult. This hobby of reading is indeed admirable. It can be seen that a person's success is also greatly related to his hobbies. Is Sun Yat-sen's great work, the Three Principles of the People, not the harvest of his reading so much?</p>
<p>The knowledge of modern people should be multifaceted, and we should find hobbies related to our future and love as lifelong partners. It can solve your worries, increase your knowledge, and help your career.</p>
<h3>India-Tibet Border (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Jia Yuan</p>
<p>Under the crescent moon of a long night, which was quite bright, I followed Mr. Shen to the hilltop. Gazing into the northwestern sky, above the clouds, a sparkling white expanse emerged, which was the highest peak of the Himalayas. The mountain's summit, perpetually covered in snow, is known to the English as Kangchenjunga, with an altitude of 24,000 feet. According to books, the highest peak of the Himalayas is Mount Everest, at 29,022 feet. I am unsure whether that is this peak, or if there is another higher than this, which remains to be verified.</p>
<p>At that time, the clouds were light and the breeze was gentle. I could only see a winding stretch descending from the northwest, faintly revealing a snow-white mountain peak, with protrusions and depressions, appearing amidst the white clouds. In the vast expanse of the sky, after gazing upwards for a while, I returned to my room to sleep when the white clouds completely obscured it.</p>
<p>The next morning, as Principal Shen got up to paint, I followed him to the place we had looked up at the previous night to continue contemplating the mountain scenery. At this time, the red sun gradually rose in the east, and the sunlight reflected off the white snow of the high peaks of the Himalayas, glittering with golden light. The shape of the peak resembled a pyramid. However, due to the distance and the obstruction of several layers of mountains, only the upper half could be seen, but the bright and dark areas of the mountain peak could still be distinguished, especially with the surrounding smaller peaks, forming a majestic scene of mountains encircling and standing out. At this moment, the white clouds rose, and the mountain peaks appeared and disappeared intermittently, giving people a sense of pleasure.</p>
<p>Principal Shen was sketching, and as the mountain peaks changed, he found it quite difficult. He could only continuously apply thick ink. Until about eight o'clock, when the mountain peaks were obscured by thick clouds, the true face of the Himalayas was hidden and no longer visible. At this point, Director Li brought tea and milk. Principal Shen introduced me to him, and he was very hospitable, until about nine o'clock, when I bid farewell and left.</p>
<p>Sikkim · Bhutan · Nepal</p>
<p>Although Kalimpong has a population of 20,000, most are merchants and poor laborers, with a low level of education, so newspapers are scarce. The city has only one Tibetan monthly newspaper, edited by Tarching Babu. It is printed by lithography, with a circulation of 300 copies, mostly sold in various parts of Tibet, as well as the three small countries of Nepal, Bhutan, and Sikkim.</p>
<p>Accompanied by Principal Shen on the morning of the 19th, I visited the newspaper. The office was also located on a hillside, with simple facilities. Tarching Babu, having lived here for a long time, knew the three small countries of Nepal, Bhutan, and Sikkim very well. After I arrived in India, I originally intended to visit these three small countries. However, Nepal and Bhutan are very conservative and severely restrict the entry of foreigners. Therefore, in the past, except for Huang Musong, who had visited Bhutan, no other Chinese had entered. When I was in Calcutta, according to Liu Darun, secretary of the "Commissioner's Office in India," Nepal and Bhutan both have consulates in Delhi. If one were to formally negotiate, it might be possible, but the procedures are too complicated. I heard that Jiang Jianbai intended to visit Nepal and Bhutan, but I do not know if there were any results.</p>
<p>When I inquired about the inside stories of Nepal, Bhutan, and Sikkim from Tarching Babu, due to the haste, many questions were difficult to answer because he had not prepared in advance. What he said is recorded below:</p>
<p>"Among the three small countries, only Sikkim (Demojong) is a British protectorate, with a small area, and is an important route to Tibet. Darjeeling and Kalimpong, which are under its jurisdiction, have already been placed within the scope of the Indian government. Now only Gangtok remains, the area where the king resides. All domestic politics, military affairs, and diplomacy are handled by the British."</p>
<p>As for Nepal and Bhutan, the situation is slightly different. The British government regularly provides subsidies, the amount of which is unknown. In the past, it was 100,000 rupees, but whether it has increased now is not very clear.</p>
<p>Nepal is located in the north, with a land area of about 1,300 miles long and 500 miles wide. Bhutan is located in the south, bordering Assam in India, with a width of about 2,500 miles. As for the political systems of the two countries, both are autocratic, and the British government does not interfere in domestic politics. The people of Nepal are naturally fierce (the so-called Gurkha people). The domestic population reaches 3 million, and their reproductive capacity is very strong, so there are many immigrants in Assam and Kashmir in India. In addition to their own trained army, many strong men serve in the British army.</p>
<p>Bhutan has a smaller population, about 1.5 million. It has no army organization because it is located in the deep mountains and there is no foreign invasion, so there is no need for an army.</p>
<p>Both countries are located in fertile land, and the people live very well. They produce grains, miscellaneous grains, vegetables, white hemp, fruits, and the like. However, transportation to the outside world is very inconvenient, relying entirely on elephants and mules. At this time of war, these countries are living apart from the world, indeed like "Shangri-La."</p>
<p>Editor's note: The above three countries were originally tributary states of our country. Except for Demojong, which is under British protection and recognized by our country, Nepal and Bhutan, although not formally recognized, have no diplomatic relations with our country.

<h3>A Small Contribution to Prohibiting Spitting Everywhere</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>I read the article "Suggestions for Prohibiting Spitting Everywhere." According to Mr. Wang's suggestion, using police booths as the standard, setting up spittoons at every booth or every other booth is certainly reasonable. But how many police booths are there in all of Shanghai? How much would it cost to buy all those spittoons? And when spitting, it is inevitable that some will be spat outside or on the lid of the spittoon, so wouldn't the purpose of setting up spittoons to prevent the spread of germs be defeated? Or some might say, "Rinse with water," but aren't there many places where it is inconvenient to get water, wouldn't that be very troublesome?</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, it would be best to use the gutters along the roads as spittoons. Gutters are available at short intervals, more than police booths, which can be sufficient for needs and there will definitely be no shortage. Furthermore, the sanitation bureau orders cleaners to frequently rinse the gutters with water, so that the sputum spit outside does not remain on the lid, and the spread of germs will not occur.</p>
<p>So, without spending a large sum of money and reducing the spread of germs, isn't this something that is convenient for everyone?</p>
<h3>Don't Be Afraid!</h3>
<p>— Xiao Lin</p>
<p>Don't be afraid of "work." No one has ever died from work. People only die from fearing the difficulties of work and worrying. Worry is the root of anxiety. If you worry when you see work, it will make you have unreasonable thoughts, make you lose balance and the spirit to work hard. So you fear one thing after another, and you accomplish nothing, hesitating and ending a precious life.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid of "love." If there is no love in life, you will not know what happiness is. A healthy spirit needs the cultivation of love, and a sound life needs the encouragement of love. There are many lovely things in the world. With the love of a kind mother, a child can grow up. With great love, life will move forward. To love, you must have a condition: that is, first make yourself "lovable."</p>
<p>Don't be afraid of "suffering." Suffering is an essential element of life's training. There is sweetness after suffering, and success after suffering. There is no successful person in the world who has not tasted suffering.</p>
<p>Don't be afraid of "death." No one can avoid "death." The most important thing is to prepare how to "die" with value. Don't let yourself disappear completely after death. You should leave your spirit and soul in the world before "dying."</p>
<h3>The Teacher of All Ages</h3>
<p>— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin Tan</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Her name was Catherine Bridges: she was twenty-five—young enough to be Chips's daughter. She had blue, sparkling eyes, freckled cheeks, and smooth, slightly yellowish hair. She also lived on a farm, spending a vacation with a girlfriend. She thought she should be responsible for Chips's accident, so she rode her bicycle every day, along the lake, to the house where this quiet, middle-aged, and respectable man was lying.</p>
<p>That's what she initially thought of him. As for him, because she would ride her bicycle, without fear, to visit a man living alone in a farmhouse living room, he couldn't quite understand what the world was changing into. His bruising could only rely on her kindness, and soon it became clear how much he needed that kindness. She was an unemployed governess, with some money saved; she had read Ibsen's works and admired him very much; she even thought they should have the right to vote. Politically, she was a radical, and her views were leaning towards people like Shaw and William Morris. Every summer afternoon in Wasdale Head, she poured out all her ideas and opinions to Chips; and he, because he wasn't very good at talking, initially thought it wasn't worth arguing with her. Her friend left, but she still stayed; Chips thought again, what can you do with such a person? He often leaned on a cane, limping along a path to the small chapel: on the wall there was a stone slab, which was comfortable to sit on, facing the sun and the lush greenery of the mountain top, while listening to a—well, yes, Chips had to admit—very beautiful girl chattering away.</p>
<p>He had never met anyone like her before. He had often thought that the modernists, this "new woman" thing, would definitely make him afraid to approach; but now, she was that kind of person, but it made him look with certainty as she rode her bicycle, safely speeding around the lake. And she had never met anyone like him before. She had also often thought that middle-aged men, reading "The Times" and denying everything modern, were always terrible pests; but now, he was that kind of person, but he aroused her interest and attention more than young men her age.

<p>Health Guidance</p>
<p>Answers by Dr. Yan Minqing</p>
<p>(1) Huang Yulin and Liu Qingkang ask: Is it effective to take "Engdemont" and "Pulesheng Solid Essence Tablets" for two years of spermatorrhea? If not, what medicine should be taken? What medicine is effective for brain leakage (excluding surgery)? Answer: It is okay to take the two medicines you mentioned for treating spermatorrhea, but I cannot guarantee their effectiveness. The most important thing is to treat the cause, such as stopping masturbation. Thoughts must also be pure and quiet, and attention should be paid to overall development and health. It is difficult to see results by relying solely on medication without removing the cause. As for the so-called brain leakage, what disease are you referring to? How can the brain leak? If a doctor diagnoses that surgery is necessary, it is still best to have surgery. Otherwise, pay attention to overall nutrition. If you can be healthy, you may be able to increase your resistance and avoid the continued deterioration of the disease.</p>
<p>(2) Wu Xiangsheng of Zhenhai asks: Living with relatives who have scabies, I was infected. I developed severe itching all over my body. When I scratch, red particles appear, and pus-filled sores often appear on my hands and feet, which are very painful. I have injected the Japanese drug 606, but it has not been effective. Please advise on a treatment method. Answer: You have scabies combined with impetigo, caused by a staphylococcus infection after scabies. For a quick recovery, you must simultaneously eliminate the scabies mites and the staphylococcus. 606 is not a specific drug for this disease, so it is not effective. This disease is not incurable, but it recurs due to repeated infection, so you must be isolated from those who are infected or treated at the same time. Clothes and bedding must be changed and disinfected by boiling every day to avoid repeated infection. The treatment method is to use a simple scabicide, such as 20% sulfur ointment, and rub it vigorously. The more vigorously you rub, the faster the treatment will be. When combined with impetigo, due to the complexity of the medication, a separate prescription is provided for use, and at the same time, take drugs such as Bainongqing or Xiaozhilong internally, or inject the drug.</p>
