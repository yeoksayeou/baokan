<h3>中日關係再檢討</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>前言</p>
<p>日本「中央公論」五月號內，載有「中國問題的新焦點與日本的態度」一文，係岡本淸一，信夫淸三郞，田中香苗，杉村廣藏，石濱知行等共同意見，集體發表，其綱日爲（一）前此的中國問題與今後的中國問題。（二）重慶爲什麼繼續抗戰？（三）美蘇爲何高興？（四）關於物資與物價。（五）中日經濟建　的新途徑。（六）在華的日本人問題。（七）中日文化應走的道路。（八）大東亞戰爭時代的中國問題。（九）怎樣獲得中國靑年的心理，等等。頗足供吾人閱讀研討，爰經譯成中文，並徵集關心中日問題之國人意見，先後收到（一）何子恒先生之　中日利平的回顧與可瞻」。（二）周越然先生之「中日文化的融和」。（三）柳雨生先生之「微思」。（四）楊光政先生之「大戰現階段的中日問題」。（五）李權時先生之「中日問題管見」。（六）潘文安先生之「自主自尊的生存要求」。（七）魯風先生之「對華新政策」。（八）陳孚木先生之「日本當前的課題」等八篇，彙成特輯，速同　文刊載申報月刋六月號（不日出版），藉作答覆。另山彬龢撰成一中日關係再檢討」一文，發表於此，以代本日星期評論。</p>
<p>日本「中央公論」五月號發表作家罔本淸一·信夫淸三郎·田中香苗·杉村廣藏·石濱知行諸氏關於「中國問題的新焦點與日本的態度」一文，以客觀興公正的態度，就中日關係諸實際問題，加以檢討，分析的建議，實在値得中日兩國人民的細心研究。律者以中國一記者的立塲，以於諸氏所提出的問題與意見，深有所感，竊就日常接觸的中國民間的心理，略加抒述，以供關心於此一間題的兩國志士之參考。</p>
<p>首先，信夫先生在「前此的中國問題與今後的中國問題」這個總題之下，就中日兩國經濟的結構，中國民挨資本之發展諸關係，作虛心的研討，實至難得。我們彼此實在不應多算舊帳，特別是在這大東亞戰爭時代，而目將來東亞新秩序正待中日兩國協力法建設，兩國人民都應有不咎旣往的雅量，才能融洽無間，肩負起歷史的重任。這是我們處理中日間任何關係的前提，否則一切都談不到。不過，檢討已往關系之癓結，從而防制未來合作之障碍，這也是十分應該的。從經濟結構（包括生產力與生產關係）來說，自最近六十年來，日本一步步去效法歐美，踏上工業化的大道，同時也承襲了資本主義的傳統。因此，宿命似地，需要殖民地，需要銷貨市塲和投資市塲以擴充其勢力。這是事實，不應該諱飾，也絕對諱飾不了。至於中國，是經濟落後的農業國，生產力的發展，內則受抑於封建制度的生產關係，外則受制於列强資本主義的侵略，一百年來，成爲半封建半殖民地的國家。可是，自從最近四五十年來，內有康梁以至國共的革命運動，外受日本維新及蘇聯革命的影響，人民的醒覺日有進步，一切情勢已非甲午或辛亥前後可比了。中日兩大隣國，在此國情懸殊的實情之下，互相殘殺則兩敗俱傷，互相合作則足以謀東亞之解放與發展。當代列强，以英美爲首，從其自國的利害着眼，惟恐中日之合作，危及其在太平洋上的非法權利與覇業因此在歐美倡「黃禍」之說，造成鄙棄及仇恨中日民族的心理，對中日則以英日同盟及美國援華等狡計，從事挑撥離間，製造事變，使相火併，終致不幸演出繼續六年的血戰。我們痛定思痛，希望雙方有志人士，尤其是雙方的實力派，澈底放棄彼此疑懼防範之心力，回復本來的態勢，也只有這樣才能呆證東亞解放之眞正的勝利。最近日本對華新政策之實施，以及中國之參戰，可說是初步的表現，今後還須進一步的作更密切的協力。信夫先生設：「過去中國問題的困難，是由日本本身對於指導日益覺醒的中華民挨之條件尙未充分成熟所致，藉日本自身經濟構成的高度化，而對華可以有眞正先進國的解放東亞實力時，則中國問題即迎刃而解」。我們覺得，在日本人自勉的塲合，這也許是必要；不過，我們無論如何可，得相信，任何片面的努力，或一方面實力之發展，決不能解決國際問題，這已有歷曆替我們註解。所以，我們要補充信夫先生的結論，就是除了日本以外，更應該幫助中國民族覺醒與強大，在中日合力之下，才能安定和繁榮東亞，也才能眞正解決今後的中日問題。以同意這種解釋。不過，同時我們必須指出，田中先生認爲重慶之繼續抗戰的原因之一，是由於蔣介石一派誤認中日不能兩立，並以此欺騙中國民衆而堅持「抗戰」。這與事實不符。實際上，蔣介石一派根本就不關心於中日能否並存，能否合作及戰爭勝敗如何，他們只是用抗戰來維持其統治地位，並　得更多的國外的接濟而已。當抗戰有利於這種目的時，就「堅持抗戰」，當一旦和平有利於這種目的時，又何嘗不會痛駡抗戰？把蔣政權估計得太高，是不符事實的。此應了解者一。次之，「堅持抗戰」的理論，並不是由中日不兩立論出發，而是由所謂「反抗日本帝國主義」這一點出發的，因此，在抗戰區內，並不特別强調反對日本人；相反的，同在抗戰陣營內，至今還有不少是眞正的知日派與親日派。這更是不能不了解者二。此外，英美對渝的欺騙，共產黨的活躍，固然也是重慶繼續抗戰的因素之一，但絕不是決定的因素。因爲，如果民衆心理上了解抗戰之非計，重慶政權憑什麼可以繼續抗戰呢？所以我們認爲，重慶政權抗戰六年而在最近才漸有將校不斷反正，其間決不單純由於政治的欺騙或壓迫，還要估計到民衆心理的方向。如果只以興數將校高級人員來看做人民方向，顯然會謬於毫釐，差於千里的。至於抗戰派方面對於倚仗英美以敵日本的心理，確實有的，重慶政權把一切寄托在英美身上，以及重慶各方面之期待美日戰事爆發等等的夢想，也有了好幾年；但是，同時，我們決不能說支持了六年的抗戰，就只靠這種期待與幻想。杭戰派所以繼續抗戰的，是另一種根據，這種根據就是一般人民對於日本的不了解，。是對於日本不能支持長期戰爭的錯誤的判斷，是對於「自力更生」的堅强的迷信，抗戰中每經過了一年，不是對於抗戰失敗的懊悔，　是以又挨過了一年了來互相慶祝。我們要認淸，支持抗戰的眞正的力量是在這裏，阻碍中日合作完成大東亞解放戰的根源就在這裏，我們必須從這裏去找對策，才是眞正有效的政策。</p>
<p>第三，石濱先生從另一角度，純從中國當前的民衆生活問題與戰時經濟問題，以專家的考察與研究，來分析中國間題，可說是最有意義的了。石濱先生正確地提出物資與物價問題，提出通貨應該防制　脹的閱題，提出物資必須加强生產的問題，特別指出當前經濟危機中的投機囤積，不是經濟危機的原因，而只是經濟不健全發展的結果之一。這是一針見血之論，也正是我們所一向不畏忠言直這以向當局呼籲的。我們始終認爲，中國問題不解決，中日關係決不能恢復本來態勢，以共同完成東亞解放的大業。而中國問題之癥結，是在爭取民心以傾覆重慶政權的持久拖戰方略；爭取民心（絕對不應該是收買民心）這個問題的焦點，就在於和平區內經濟問題的解決，就在於和平區內民生之改善與向上，特別是物資增產之完成及物價政策之實現，人民眞正達到了安居樂業之後，文王五十里而建八百年一統之天下，何況今日和平區已佔全國最富僥之區？「在華日本人問題」，確實也是悠關中日關係順逆之一大因素。石濱先生在這裏所說的，雖然側重其對於日本人的希望，但也可見日本人士對於新政策之誠意，他坦白的說出：「特權或權益在未驅逐範圍內，即使不依靠軍隊保護也能居住和營業，所以，要淸楚地瞭解政策轉變的整個性，然後可以活動。」我們應特別注意石濱先生這種對日方人士的忠吿，可是，同時，我們也應喚起國人對於日人之信仰與如手如足之互愛互助的責任心。</p>
<p>除了經濟以外，我們認定解決中日間題的鎖鑰，就只有文化工作，岡本先生的「中日文化應走的路」，極其客觀和坦率地分析中國文化與日本文化的歷史的關係及其不可强同的現實，正確地指出：「對於文化交流，一面是如是的共同基礎，另一面的條件，又必須是相互不同的文化。假如二者不是異質的文化，那末沒有相互交流的力量。所以我們想到中日文化的將來時，首先必須發展其異質性（個性），要確保相互存在的理由，不可侵犯對方毫厘。只有承認和保證這種異質性，才能期待文化交流與相互發展。這可說是中日交化工作者永恒的檄文，誓詞與工作綱領</p>
<p>「大東亞戰爭時代的中國問題」，問題的焦點只是「把握民心」四個字，杉村先生所見，一點不錯。不過「把握民心，決不同於「牧買民心」，因此，消極的說：「用日本的巨款，收買中國民衆的心，如果認爲人民雖然在抗日煽動下，但一有滿足其口腹之慾的機會與便宜時，即對政府歌功頌德，」當然，這不是把握民心，把握的只是極少數機會主義者，一旦這種機會不再存在，他們也就望望然去之了。而且把握了機會主義者，則一定更遠離眞正的長心，這是必然的道理。可是，重慶政權是否走的這條絕路呢？杉村先生說：「抗日政府不斷地努力於刺激人民的利慾心。同時，，英美等國交還自已的權益以收買人心，目想種種機會，對中國人民，擬慷日本權益之慨，不斷地迎合抗日政府。這就是產生中國事變，爆發大東亞戰爭的原因」。關於這一節，英美之利誘抗日政權，以及抗日政權之　利用機會，這是百分之百的事實。不過，如其說抗日政府對人民收買，「不斷刺激人民的利慾心一，我們應認清，不是事實，除了數分子吃抗戰飯發國難財以外，大多數人民—在抗日政權下的人民，也只有受到種種實際的痛苦犧牲，而決不會有人以爲抗戰是一種獲利事業。以追求利慾來解釋中國一部份人民之支持抗戰，是會得到完全錯誤的結論的。因此，同樣的，以一刺激人民利慾心」來勸誘和平區人民對日本合作，也不會收到眞正有利於兩國的效果的。杉村先生說大東亞戰爭後，中國問題，「眞正的解決者只有與日本協力的國民政府，在此我們可以說得出如何把握民心的焦點來」。但是，我們還應該對這一結論加以補充，即這是以國民政府來對重慶政權說的，把握民心自然要離開重慶政權而以國民政府爲對象，但國民政府是不是就是中國民心的集中點呢，顯然，還有待於國民政府與民間領袖之共同努力呢！</p>
<p>岡本先生的「文化運動」理論以及杉村先生的「把握民心」兩者中，其中最重要的一個節目是「怎樣獲得中國靑年的心理？」這一點，岡本先生又替我們提出了極正確的理論，指出了最坦蕩的大路。岡本先生對於中國問題，不是從表面的與局部的現象而是從內部的與全面的內容加以觀察，所以把握住的就一定是一切問題的核心。他明確地指出：「我想，在他們—指中國靑年—那種拋棄近代都市文明精神而作窮鄉僻壤生活精神當中，看看幾十年後的中國。因爲我深信他們將是未來中國文化及政治的負責者。假如幾年後，東亞恢復了和平，和我們交游，且在文化領域內和我們競爭的對手，只有他們。這一點我們必須深刻記住。」我們今日言把握民心，固然不全是這一輩人，但確實，從達大的背景來看，就得承認這一輩靑年之所以會產生及堅持其所志，這是中華民族的精神之最高的表現，也正是中國民心之最眞實的表現。我們要談「把握民心」，眞應該從此着手，才是根本的正確的方向。至於把握的方法，重慶政府失敗了，因爲，誠如岡本先生所說：「對於担負民族命運與面對着切實人生者看來，你無論怎樣把握之技巧好，但都引不起他們的一顧」，「用手腕而感動人心的事例，在人類歷史上我們還未聽見過」。因此，我們也衷誠地發出岡本先生的心聲：「假如一個政策行動和言詞，在我們歷史民族和時代相同的日本人的心坎中如不能起反應，而也不能使中國靑年人感動者，那就是因爲民族與歷史傳統的不同，且又因爲是戰爭中的對方。關於這一點，我們必須深深考慮，在這六年戰爭當中，是否有何成就？」「假如在最近的將來，日本能把握住中國靑年人的心理，那只有爲個人及國家，甚至爲全人類，而用博愛博大，謙虛的精神，我們艱苦奮鬥的眞諦，感動了中國人民的靈魂之時，才能寳現，只有在那時候，很自然地，將消逝大陸上的火藥氣味」。</p>
<p>我們認爲，中日關係或所謂中國問題之解決，不要按着預懸的理想政策，口號而去找求結論，這樣，結果必然是要全盤錯誤的。所以必須從對方的實際情形，即是要有面對現實的勇氣，不怕觀察對方眞正的面目與心肝及與行動的眞意，加以解剖研究，然後才會得到眞正的結論，而只有道種結論，才會有力地推進政策，而實現我們雙方的理想，這也許就可說是岡本先生所說的「新良心的歷史精神」，謝謝中央公論刋載這幾篇文章，使我們知道在日本，「正在較腦汁的誠實人，現在到處都有」但是。我們中國呢，這樣肯認眞觀察校腦汁的人何其少啊！</p>

<p>代表諸君：東亞廣播聯絡會議在今天舉行第二次會犧，全東亞思想戰最前綫的鬥士，經日本·滿洲國·以及華北華南各地不速千里而來，相聚敝國首都南京，參加此次會議的宣傳及廣播機關，共有三十五個單位，出席的代表，則有七十餘人。我們在今天看到代表諸君，在嚴肅的態度之中，充滿着一種精誠團結的氣象，這樣子站在保衛東亞的整個崗位上，披瀝誠意，檢討今後的廣播戰略。我相信對於整個戰局最後勝利之決定，以及在戰後新秩序的着着進行，都可以發生最大的力量，即此一端巳經使我的衷心感到無限的興奮了。想到在大東亞戰爭的持續中間，也就是在大東亞建設展開中間，友邦一方面不斷的努力獲取光榮的戰果，一方面對於國民政府寄予極大的期待，給予極大的協助，於此尤其不能不表示深切的謝意。廣播事業在思想建設上，在平時已經重要萬分，在戰爭的時候更加是加倍的重要。一切戰爭意義之普及，戰爭情緒之提高，以及戰爭狀態之報道，無不需要以電波來傳達這一切，來達到戰爭的最後目的。在每個國家的宣傳政策上，固然不能不把廣播放在最重要的一環，在國家的集團中間，在協力戰爭一點上，更是要以一致的精神互相密切的配合起來，形成一個保衛國家集團的電波戰錢。怎樣才能使彼此發生密切的連繫怎樣才能鞏固這一條電波戰綫。這一點，正是我們今天舉行廣播聯絡會議的最大意義，必須竭誠商討的，而我們在商討和聯絡中間所需要特別注意的，不只是技術方面的，並且在廣播的內容上必須取得一致的意見。本人的私見，認爲我們爲達到上面所說目的起見，爲注意廣播所收的効果，似乎應該在節目的內容上各就其環境的需要，適應一般民衆的心理，從廣播的興趣着手，才能爭取到大多數的聽衆，接收我們的宣傳。自從大東亞戰爭發生以後，我們已經知道，這是一次東亞民族的解放戰爭，每一個東亞的國家，爲了自己的生存，都不能不舉所有人力物力，盡其應盡的責任，因爲現代的戰爭是總力的戰爭，我們在具有軍事必備的實力以外，還要有國民全體的精神，作爲戰爭勝利的最大把握。今後東亞的廣播，應該針對這一點，爲喚起東亞民族意識，動員東亞的民族精神共同的努力，不斷的努力，這是這次會議的第二個重要的意義。中國方面最近以最高國防會議通過，由國民政府頒布了戰時文化宣傳政策大綱，這是決定整個中國戰時文化路向的，而廣播事業的强化，也在道個根本的政綱下面，佔據很重要的一個部門。今後的中國廣播事業，自然是遵循這個基本的政策大綱所指示的去前進。各友邦宣傳工作人員，廣播工作人員，希望對於這個思想戰爭的綱領及其發展，時刻予以協助，使能迅速達到中國新的文化宣傳事業，建設之完成。謹以至誠祝各位的健康及前途無量，祝東亞廣播事業的前途無量。</p>
<h3>龐炳勳發表　參加和運經過</h3>
<p>南京十九日中央社電　中央社記者於日昨往訪龔炳勳將軍，叩詢此次晋京觀感，承發表談話如下：本人願以十二分的熱誠，發表此次參加和運的經過與感想。本人獻身黨國，從事軍旅已二十餘年，只知有國家，不知有個人，但能有利於祖國者，任何犧牲，在所不辭。七七事變後，認爲非抗戰不能救國，於是轉戰滄州。台兒莊？豫東。晋南各戰塲，大小戰役凡數百次。民國二十九年，奉命北渡，掃蕩共產，在太行山在無糧無彈之艱苦環境中，苦撑三年有半。余所領導之忠勇袍澤與共匪鬥爭之情形，極爲悲壯，亦國人共知者。即以三十一年度在河北省與共匪殘殺之高級幹部却有三十一人之多，共產黨爲中國之內串，亦爲東亞之禍害，英美爲中日之公敵，亦新秩序之公敵，本人因此主張安內攘外，唯此爲中國及東亞自救之路。因之中日兩國，必須親密合作，同舟共濟，外攘英美，內滅共匪，否則前途不堪設想。自從國府還都以後，在在主席領導之下，一切建設均呈蓬蓬勃勃新國家之氣象。友邦對於國民政府積極援助，如撤廢治外法權，交還租界等，即爲誠意與事實之明證。本人旋認定和平爲救國唯一途徑的信念，故決心爲和平剿共盡最大之努力，日前晋京得晋謁主席聆訓，益增感奮，而後唯有誓矢忠誠，爲祖國貢獻一切。然本人能力有限，恐有負同胞之之熱望，尙期各界同志多加指導，來京時諸蒙各長官各友好及新聞界諸位親切招待，彌感不安，並謹借此機會表示謝意。</p>

<h3>印領袖鮑斯略歷</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　印度獨立運動巨頭江特拉鮑斯之略歷如次：一八九七年生於加爾各答附近，一九二〇年在劍橋大學修業。在劍橋大學畢業後，這參加甘地翁之不合作運動，邃歸國當被選任國民會議派執行委員。一九二三年山國民會議派組急進派，一九二四年任加爾各答市議會會長。一九二七年被捕拘禁於瓦城後，因病被釋。一九三〇年任加爾各答市長，一九三一年於市長任中，因指揮遊行，被警憲毆打，受重傷，且被逮捕監禁，一九三三年，一度被釋放，不久復被逮捕，此際民衆示威運動，已漸熾烈，一九三三年，以出國遊歷這條件，復被釋放當赴維也納。一九三六年，不顧政府之警吿，竟歸國，乃抵孟買即被逮捕。一九九三七年於拘禁中，復因病而得釋放，其後二個月間，曾赴歐洲，作短期旅行，證明英政府之對印政策，並無變史。一九三八年被選任印度國民會議派議長。一九三九年因得衆望，復被選這議長，但因受會議派之攻擊，不得已而辭職。此後即於會議　內組成前衛派，宣言反對英妥協，及準備武力抵抗。一九四〇年四月，率前衛派開始不合作運動，七月被捕入，獄中被選這中央立法會議員，一九四一年因要求釋放，實行斷食，旋即被釋。同年一月廿六日，即吿失踪，一九四二年新嘉坡被日軍攻陷後，彼秘密中突以無綫雷對印度民衆廣播，謂今已這與日本以及軸心各國提携，打倒英國，完成完全獨立之秋云。</p>

<h3>倫敦正式任命　華維爾爲印督　所遺印度總司令一缺　由歐慶萊克將軍繼任</h3>
<p>里斯本十九日中央社電　昨晚倫敦正式公布，陸軍上將華維爾爵士，巳被任這印度總督，以繼林列資戈勳爵，華氏所遺印度總司令一缺，則由歐欽萊克將軍繼之。英國民衆與政府人士，年餘以來，所討論之問題，至此始吿解決。現任印督之林列資戈，係一九三六年四月就任，本應於一九四〇年滿任，惟鑒於戰事爆發，與印度之緊張局勢，乃一再展期，以至於今。林氏在印之治績，會屢受嚴格之批評，尤以本年下院之抨擊這最甚，責其無能力促成印度政府與印度人民間之諒解。當克里浦斯爵士，與印度大會黨，及全印回敎同盟各領袖舉行談判之時，林氏所持態度亦受倫敦方面之嚴峻批評，實則林氏之最堅決反對者，係屬大會黨之各著名領袖。至於歐欽萊克之繼華氏，指揮印度反軸心軍隊，據倫敦方面之解釋，不過這開復一免職將軍之職位，因去年八月間，英相邱吉爾，以西里那加戰敗之責任，加諸歐氏，而免去其中東英軍總司令之職務也。華維爾就職日期，尙未見發表，此次之任命，倫敦人士，並不引以爲奇，蓋華氏被任印督之呼聲，早已盛傳也。</p>

<h3>特戈爾季勞間　關係未臻完善</h3>
<p>里斯木十九日中央社電　據海通社訊，阿爾及爾之政局，並未若路透社之所傳，巳獲解決，反之，自特戈爾季勞之法國民族解決委員會召開首次會議後，局勢似較前更這複雜。此間法人，指謂陰謀活動者，仍在幕後活躍，故危險之環境，迄未消滅，據悉該處將有「中心黨」之成立，合衆社謂共任務，在特戈爾與季勞之間，擔任居間工作，其成立之初步工作，已於昨日解放委員會首次會議復開始，足以影響特季兩人政策之賈德魯，莫奈及馬西格里，有任該黨中堅之說。衆料解委會大部份人員，不論與特季兩人之私人關係如何，均將隸屬該黨，又悉解放委員會定今日續開會議，以討論基於民主原則，改組法國軍隊之問題。</p>

<h3>日本木造船業概況</h3>
<p>大東亞戰爭勃發以來的木造船建造熱，如火如茶，但對於目前木造船的超重點性，一般人未必均已充分認識。世間尙有不少人以這太造船是無濟於事的。和鋼鐵質的船雙比較起來，木造船確實是貧弱而老杇，世人之任意加以蔑視，並非毫無理由。事實上款把二者比較起來，在速力，積載力，耐久性耐波性上，木造船終究比不上鋼船。</p>
<p>不用說，把目前的木造船建造問題，從匕述能率及經濟性的觀點看來，顯然不是焦點的所在，但是木造船間題，究竟具有節約鐵材的意義，在這一點上，木造船和　船可予以同等價値。而且如其廢止小型鋼船的建造，而把這鋼鐵材料用於太造船（即大型木鐵交造船、，在國策上是有利的。</p>
<p>建造木造船所使用的鋼鐵材料不及鋼船的三分之一，所以建造一艘鋼船的鋼質可用以建造同噸型的木鐵交造船三艘。無論如何，目前木造船的超重點性，具有上述積極的意義。</p>
<p>因此，當局對於建造這種使命朮大的木造船大這努力，自是常然的。政府首先把木造船的戰時標準型從七〇噸至三〇〇噸分這六種，其後作這加緊建造的目的者限定於二五〇噸型，一五〇噸型，　〇〇噸型三種，同時這了節的資材，排除熟練性，使生產簡易化起見，用箱型設計來着手船型。於是、能率之點也具備了，又百噸級的小型就航船在某程度量的上也已有充分的關係了，指導其盡量建造大型的二五〇噸級木造船。不僅如此。最近且在試造三〇〇噸，五〇〇噸的木鐵交造船。</p>
<p>與此同時，木造船業的統制也正在着着進行。關於此點寺島遞相在第八十一屆議會上所說的最這要的。他說：</p>
<p>「木造船廠全國雖有幾千所，但均規模甚小，僱用工人百人以上的極少。大多數僅有工人十名以下。遞信省視這這幾千所應統合而集的爲幾百所，又在建造標準船時，這個別的造船所亦嫌過小，所以把另星的組合地結集起來設立全國聯合會，置於一元的管理下，並使此木造船全國聯合會爲造船聯合會的構成員之一，參副造船計劃」。</p>
<p>依遞信相的說明，可知以前建造木船的規模極爲零星細小，如其集的起來而使之高度生產，頗這困難。這一點，在許多鎮工塲所生產的引擎部面上亦有同樣情形。政府對建造木造船的分野，勸令探用大規模的方式。這響應政府，許多有力的企業會社，如日本郵船。大阪商船，山下汽船，三井物產，川崎汽船，栗林商船，函館船渠，王子製紙，松下電氣會社等，均新設木造船建造會社，下面是幾家新創的大規模的會社：</p>
<p>三井物產株式會社設立附屬的三井木造船株式會社（資本金一千萬元），塲計有岩手縣、三重縣、香川縣，島根縣，靑森縣，大分縣，鳥取縣等九所。日本郵船會社則與當地的業者相聯合，在和歌山，鹿兒島，大分，長崎，廣島，德島等六縣另外設立有明造船，海瀉造船，中國造船，南　造船等會社。栗林商船會社則聯合王子製紙會社，函館船渠會社設立東日本造船株式會社，（資本金一千萬元）喝在釧路市建設工塲。大阪商船會社則另外設立報國造船株式會社（資本金五百萬元），在石川縣從事建造。山下汽船會社在山口縣新設株式會社下松造船所（資本金五百萬元），又川崎汽船會社則新設宮城木造船株式會社（資本金一千萬元），又原是電器業者的松下電氣會社，亦設立松下造船所（一千萬元），在秋田及大阪建殷工塲，頗可注目。</p>
<p>依據這大規模的進行，日本今後最急要的大型木造船，木鐵交造船的大量生產，即將實現。同時、這種新方式的採用，對上述中小業者之固執陳舊方式，亦將與以新鮮的剌激。大企業者，尤其是財閥，以這建造木造船事業對其造船部門在企業上並無多大的貫獻。然而有力者之積極的參加，在這時候是非常必要的，且又爲日本造船界在既往所無的特異的戰時色彩，頗饒興味。（翔：譯自「東洋經濟新報」第二〇七五號）</p>

<h3>社會福利部丁部長　談「節約」與「救災」　對本報節宴公約表示贊成</h3>
<p>中央社訊　社會福利部丁部長已來滬，中央社記者特往訪問，楊談節的與救災，丁部長談話如下：</p>
<p>「節約我是向來提倡的，因這節的，就是儉，儉是一種美德，所謂儉以　德，我主張非特物質方面要節的，同時如時間精神以及慾望名利都要節的·非特在戰時物質缺乏情形下要節約，即在平時也應當節的，非特一般民衆要節的，尤其公務人員更應當節的，所謂廉介之風，都由節的養成，中國古人都有儉樸之風，遠的例子不必舉，即以大家熟知的近代人曾文正公而言，他對節的非常重視。且身體力行，他說「官廚少一雙之箸，民間寬一分之力」，足證官吏能儉，可以安民，又說「欲學廉介，必先知足，觀於谷處難民遍地餓莩，則吾輩之安居良食，已屬至幸，尙何奢望哉，尙何暴殄哉，」這一般話與最近周佛海先生在「四遊北平雜感」一文中說及「華北的糧食間題非常嚴重，我常想自己沒有甚麼特別享受，不過是日食三餐，夜眠一榻，現在想起來已經是得天獨厚了，日有三餐可食，用不着去吃草根樹葉，夜有一榻可眠，用不着去睡水門汀，這不是特別享受是甚麼，在特別享受之中，萬萬不可忘記民間疾苦，」以上所述都値得大家特別警惕的，所以我個人對節的很重視，常以之自勉，並勉勵同人的。」</p>
<p>「實節辦法很多，我總以這最要緊的大家先養成一種節約的風氣才好，最近申報上提出的許多意見，我都很贊成，尤其對節省宴費公約的辦法，更這需要，如李贊侯袁履登聞蘭亭唐壽民諸位先生，都已參加，我想一定能普遍的提倡起來，主座汪先生對宴客早已實行節單化，且禁止公務人員以處宴款客，我個人招待賓客，大部份都由家廚煮調，菜肴甚少，一切簡陋」，「按現在一般的現象，在主人方面　得非富肴盛宴不足以表示誠意，有些淺俗之輩，亦以豐肴盛宴這「派頭大」，這種心理，實欠高妙，亟應改變，要養成以「簡單樸實這榮，奢侈虛靡這辱」，的新風氣，人人如此，久而久之，就可普遍了」。談到這裏，我又要引曾文正公這例，他說「凡多欲者不能儉，好動者不能儉，多欲如好衣好食好聲好色書畫古玩之類，皆可浪費被家」，但文正公自己說，向無癖嗜之好，而頗有好動之弊，今日思作某事，明日思訪某客，所費日增，而不覺後來講求儉約，曾戒好動而不輕出門不輕舉事，不特不作無益之事，即修理橋棵道路寺觀善堂亦不輕作舉動，其次他說「僕從宜少，所謂食之者寡也，　情宜减，所謂用之者舒也，否則今日不儉，異日必多欠債，既負債於觀友，亦貽書於子孫」。故我們如能戒除多欲好動，即可實行簡約」。</p>
<p>最後關於購災方面丁先生也提出意見說</p>
<p>「此次上海各界對於華北賬災捐　非常熱烈，實　感佩，希　上海富有者多多解　，惟自贏不暇者自可不必勉强，其次，更希望富有者參加節約運動，减少一切日常浪　，俾積少成多，　爲鉅飲，以之救災，寶屬一舉兩得」。</p>

<h3>吉田東祐昨講演　中日事變解決之可能性</h3>
<p>本市中國建設靑年隊昨（十九日）下午三時，假座康樂酒店舉行中日問題購演座談會。邀請研究中日同題有素之日本學者吉田束祐氏出席演講「中日事變解決之可能性」，到隊員及各大學學生暨來賓等五十餘人、隊長周怕甘主席，報吿舉打座談　演會之意義，旋介紹吉田氏講演。</p>
<p>演詞要旨</p>
<p>吉田演詞要旨大意謂：「美名記者約翰根室於其所著「亞細亞內幕」內嘗謂，中日問題無解決可能性，其理由有三：（一）日本有擴展領土心，（二）中國無力趕出日本軍隊，（三）日本與歐洲各國銜突事件極多。因此結論謂「中日將成永久戰綫」，依現階段情况觀之，約翰之言不幸而中。兩國有戰之士。同抱遺憾。當一九三六年間，中國「抗日」之民氣激昻，上海方面的救國會派。共產黨。英美等國更從中播動。邃爆發中日事變，斯時各黨派在「統一」口號之下，無法反蔣以謀取木身利益，祗有藉抗日之名作反蔣企圖，蔣政府一時不能控制民情，而又不肯犧牲政　。邃不計後果。貿然與日銜突。迨後，京滬淪陷，蔣政權駐守武漢，已認淸中日不應長戰，圖謀　決方式，組織三民主義靑年團，思領導人民趨向事變解決之途，延至今日，中日全而和平仍未能實現者，其原因實在英美之從中阻梗與共產黨之挑撥拖戰。節年十二月八日大東亞戰爭爆發，日本屢次聲明對華之眞正意旨，一面並實行放棄在華已得之各種權益，希望中日兩國眞正合作，打倒英美，此種措置，現在且已漸漸引起蔣政權統治下各方面之注意。據此而觀，中日事變全面解決之可能性，已非遙遠人吉田氏末更鄭重謂，解決中日事變問題之重心，乃在兩國國民能否完全彼此瞭解，如兩國民衆觀念意向不一致，雖渝政權能接受日方合作誠意，將來衝突，仍難泯滅。反之，如兩國國民能眞誠親善，縱渝政權與英美及共產黨從中作梗，全面解決仍很可能。因此，吾人對解決事變之努力途徑，宜循此而急進，俾束亞和平臻於永久圓滿之境。講詞歷一句鐘之久，聽衆極這感動。</p>
<p>未由出席各學生提出問題多種，吉田氏分別予以詳細置答，直至五時許始散會。</p>

<p>討論範團：</p>
<p>全國商業統制總會這經濟集體自治之惟一機構，直至最近，內部機構始稱初吿完成，但以社會公衆尙多未能明瞭商統會內部機構之各種聯繫，以及在施行統制經濟工作上之各實際情形，應採取何種方式，俾使商統會一切內容，均得公開於社會公衆之前。</p>
<p>決定辦法：</p>
<p>（一）關於統制工作之有特殊報吿價値者，如最近之「小麥統買」一類問題，由本報經濟界提出訪問，由商統會負責解釋。（二）關於工商同業公會聯合會一類問題，由本報經濟界隨時分別邀請各聯合會方面負責人參加座談，由商統會方面負責人同時列席。（三）關於商統會在統制工作上之一般情報，由商統會在最近期間，發行一種不定期刋物，但在每次未發行以前，得先行擇允交由本報經濟界預這披露。</p>
<p>以上三種辦法，旨在顯示商統會方面一切工作，均這絕對公開。因商統會在政府監督指導之下，必須努力完成其集體自治之機構，允期母悖其集體自治之精神。</p>

<h3>我所知之高翰卿先生</h3>
<p>— 張炳若</p>
<p>丙寅秋，余就業五洲藥房，始獲識公司畫事高翰卿先生，先生與已故　公粹芳同這我國大出版家，蓋即四十六年前商務書館之創始人也。</p>
<p>己巳春，余銜總經理項公松茂命，入廠受讀，項公延先生主講「靑年成功之路」，先生以節儉力行四字這諸生勉，恂恂有儒者風，時人譽這今之憂平仲，先生固當之無愧也。</p>
<p>淞滬變起，項公殉難，五洲事業，頓呈羣龍無首狀態。先生時年大十有九，吿退已五年，卒徇全體股東推舉，出任艱巨，繼項公未竟之業。先生治事精神，以不變應萬變，指揮若定，十年如一日。五洲聲譽賴以延續不墜者，先生之力這多。</p>
<p>癸酉仲　，欣逢先生占稀攬揆之辰，友人林君虎贊，主編五洲月刊，撰先生訪問記數千言，先生曾自述其身世綦詳。先生自賺這鏡花水月，一夢黃梁，海上報章雜誌競相轉載，資所矜式。</p>
<p>先生老友虞和欽先生，用苟子語「美意延年」四字這先生壽，足徵先生克享大年之有自也。</p>
<p>甲戌冬，五洲增設廣州分店，余佐方慶成先生主其事，瀕行，先生錢之以詞曰：嶺南，固余之舊遊地也，君等此行，應驚其大者遠者，盧心求進，切毋妄自菲薄。　者我國閉關自封，中原文化，流布南方，海通以還，新智輸入，改由南來，醫藥衛生，爲民族健康所繫，允宜取長彌短，期以自樹，君等職責重大，逐利猶其次焉。長者殷殷之望，亦可見眼光之遠大，與市儈自是不同。</p>
<p>丙子雙十節，五洲新廈落成，余奉召旋滬，依先生治理文案，朝夕親炙，有如家人父子。慨余幼年失學，業餘謀所以自修之道，先生每惠以典籍，復不厭詳這講劃，循循然若嚴師之臨其徒焉。</p>
<p>先生篤信基督敎，終身奉守不渝，遇週末，假松茂紀念堂延諸辛生牧師這同人講道，濁世中啓人醜覺不少。余嘗侍先生赴靑年會廣學會宴聚，先生云三十年前即聯合謝洪賚，兪國楨，李恒春，宋耀如，鄔挺生，鮑成昌，黃家　諸同志，首創中國基督徒會，植我國敎會自立之初基，今日中國牧師完全不受差會贊助津貼者，先生之功，實不可沒。</p>
<p>丁丑難作，滬埠淪這孤易，百物踊貴，民不聊生，工潮迭起，風　全市，五洲同人組織聯誼會，要求當局改善待遇，余被推爲同人代表之一，屢與當局折衝。某次，先生坐南窗前，這言世事愁苦，忽愴然涕下，代表胥感泣，卒依先生一言以這決。先生引王荊公言戒於衆曰：「賢者不得其道，不肖者得行無道，　者不得行禮，貴者得行無禮。」仁者之言，可謂代弱小者鳴不平也　。</p>
<p>嗣余去五洲就南洋藥房聘，十五年賓主，一朝云別，不禁　然神傷。比歲以還，先生移居靑年會宿舍，遵卷時晦，不問外事。余每趨謁，先生輒致　　之詞，長厚多情，可感孰甚。六月二十日恭逢先生八秩杖朝之年，先生悲天憫人，懇辭稱祝，捐廉萬金救濟華北災黎，所謂壽人者適以自壽，以先生之康强善飯推之，由此至於期頭，至於無量福壽，可預慶焉。</p>

<h3>Re-examining Sino-Japanese Relations</h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>Preface</p>
<p>The May issue of the Japanese "Chuo Koron" features an article titled "New Focus of the China Problem and Japan's Attitude," a collective opinion jointly expressed by Okamoto Seiichi, Nobu Kiyosaburo, Tanaka Kanae, Sugimura Hiroshi, Ishihama Tomoyuki, and others. Its outline is as follows: (1) The China problem before and after this point; (2) Why does Chongqing continue to resist? (3) Why are the US and the Soviet Union pleased? (4) Regarding goods and prices; (5) New paths for Sino-Japanese economic construction; (6) The problem of Japanese people in China; (7) The path that Sino-Japanese culture should take; (8) The China problem in the era of the Greater East Asia War; (9) How to win the hearts of Chinese youth, etc. It is worthy of our reading and discussion. Therefore, it has been translated into Chinese, and opinions from Chinese people concerned about Sino-Japanese relations have been solicited. We have successively received: (1) Mr. He Ziheng's "Review and Prospects of Sino-Japanese Equality"; (2) Mr. Zhou Yueran's "Fusion of Sino-Japanese Cultures"; (3) Mr. Liu Yusheng's "Reflections"; (4) Mr. Yang Guangzheng's "Sino-Japanese Problems at the Current Stage of the War"; (5) Mr. Li Quanshi's "Personal Views on Sino-Japanese Problems"; (6) Mr. Pan Wen'an's "Demand for Autonomous and Self-Respecting Survival"; (7) Mr. Lu Feng's "New Policy Towards China"; (8) Mr. Chen Fumu's "Current Issues Facing Japan." These eight articles are compiled into a special issue and will be published in the June issue of the Shen Bao Monthly (to be published soon) as a response. In addition, Chen Binhe has written an article titled "Re-examining Sino-Japanese Relations," published here to replace the weekly commentary.</p>
<p>The May issue of the Japanese "Chuo Koron" published an article on the "New Focus of the China Problem and Japan's Attitude" by writers Okamoto Seiichi, Nobu Kiyosaburo, Tanaka Kanae, Sugimura Hiroshi, and Ishihama Tomoyuki. With an objective and impartial attitude, they examined, analyzed, and suggested practical issues in Sino-Japanese relations, which are indeed worthy of careful study by the people of both countries. As a Chinese journalist, I feel deeply about the issues and opinions raised by these gentlemen. I will briefly express my views on the psychology of the Chinese people that I come into contact with daily, for the reference of patriots in both countries who are concerned about this issue.</p>
<p>First of all, it is commendable that Mr. Nobu sincerely discussed the economic structure of China and Japan and the development of Chinese private capital under the general topic of "The China Problem Before and After This Point." We should not dwell on old scores, especially in this era of the Greater East Asia War, and as the new order in East Asia awaits the joint efforts of China and Japan to build it, the people of both countries should have the magnanimity to forgive the past so that they can be in complete harmony and shoulder the heavy responsibility of history. This is the premise for us to handle any relationship between China and Japan; otherwise, nothing can be discussed. However, it is also very important to examine the knots of past relations in order to prevent future obstacles to cooperation. From the perspective of economic structure (including productivity and production relations), Japan has been emulating Europe and the United States step by step in the last sixty years, embarking on the road of industrialization, and at the same time inheriting the tradition of capitalism. Therefore, it fatefully needs colonies, markets for sales, and markets for investment to expand its power. This is a fact, which should not be concealed and absolutely cannot be concealed. As for China, it is an economically backward agricultural country. The development of its productivity is internally suppressed by feudal production relations and externally restricted by the aggression of capitalist powers, becoming a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country for a hundred years. However, in the last four or fifty years, internally, there have been revolutionary movements from Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao to the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and externally, there have been influences from the Japanese Meiji Restoration and the Soviet Revolution. The awakening of the people has progressed day by day, and the situation is no longer comparable to that before the Sino-Japanese War or the 1911 Revolution. Under the reality of such a vast difference in the national conditions of China and Japan, two major neighboring countries, mutual killing will result in mutual loss, while mutual cooperation is enough to seek the liberation and development of East Asia. Contemporary powers, led by Britain and the United States, only fear the cooperation between China and Japan, which would endanger their illegal rights and hegemony in the Pacific Ocean, from the perspective of their own interests. Therefore, they advocate the "Yellow Peril" theory in Europe and the United States, creating a mentality of contempt and hatred towards the Chinese and Japanese nations, and using cunning plans such as the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and American aid to China to instigate discord, create incidents, and make them fight each other, eventually leading to the unfortunate performance of a six-year bloody war. We painfully reflect on this and hope that people of insight on both sides, especially the power groups on both sides, will completely abandon their mutual suspicion and defense, and restore their original attitude. Only in this way can we ensure the true victory of East Asian liberation. The recent implementation of Japan's new policy towards China and China's participation in the war can be said to be preliminary manifestations. In the future, we must further cooperate more closely. Mr. Nobu said: "The difficulty of the China problem in the past was due to the fact that Japan itself was not fully mature in guiding the increasingly awakened Chinese nation. When Japan itself has the power to truly liberate East Asia as an advanced country due to the sophistication of its economic structure, the China problem will be solved easily." We feel that this may be necessary for Japanese self-encouragement; however, we must believe that any one-sided effort or the development of one side's strength cannot solve international problems. History has already given us clear explanations. Therefore, we want to supplement Mr. Nobu's conclusion, that is, in addition to Japan, we should also help the Chinese nation to awaken and become strong. Under the joint efforts of China and Japan, we can stabilize and prosper East Asia, and truly solve the Sino-Japanese problem in the future. Agree with this interpretation. However, at the same time, we must point out that Mr. Tanaka believes that one of the reasons for Chongqing's continued resistance is that the Chiang Kai-shek faction mistakenly believes that China and Japan cannot coexist, and uses this to deceive the Chinese people and insist on "resistance." This is not in accordance with the facts. In fact, the Chiang Kai-shek faction simply does not care whether China and Japan can coexist, whether they can cooperate, or how the war will be won or lost. They only use resistance to maintain their ruling position and obtain more foreign assistance. When resistance is beneficial to this purpose, they "insist on resistance," and when peace is beneficial to this purpose, why wouldn't they denounce resistance? It is not in accordance with the facts to overestimate the Chiang regime. This should be understood first. Secondly, the theory of "insisting on resistance" does not start from the theory that China and Japan cannot coexist, but from the so-called "resisting Japanese imperialism." Therefore, in the resistance areas, there is no particular emphasis on opposing the Japanese; on the contrary, even within the resistance camp, there are still many who are truly knowledgeable about Japan and pro-Japanese. This is something that must be understood second. In addition, the deception of Chongqing by Britain and the United States, and the activity of the Communist Party, are certainly factors in Chongqing's continued resistance, but they are by no means decisive factors. Because, if the people psychologically understand that resistance is not a good plan, what can the Chongqing regime rely on to continue resistance? Therefore, we believe that Chongqing's regime has been resisting for six years, and only recently have generals been constantly defecting. The reason for this is not simply political deception or oppression, but also the direction of the people's psychology must be taken into account. If we only look at the direction of the people from the perspective of a few generals and senior officials, we will obviously be wrong by a hair's breadth and miss by a thousand miles. As for the resistance faction's psychology of relying on Britain and the United States to fight Japan, it does exist. The Chongqing regime has placed all its hopes on Britain and the United States, and Chongqing has been dreaming of the outbreak of war between the United States and Japan for several years; however, at the same time, we must not say that the six-year resistance has only been supported by this kind of expectation and fantasy. The reason why the resistance faction continues to resist is based on another kind of foundation, which is the general people's lack of understanding of Japan, the erroneous judgment that Japan cannot support a long-term war, and the firm belief in "self-reliance." Every year that passes during the resistance is not a regret for the failure of the resistance, but a celebration of having survived another year. We must clearly recognize that the true power supporting the resistance is here, and the root cause hindering the completion of the Greater East Asia Liberation War through Sino-Japanese cooperation is here. We must find countermeasures from here, which are the only truly effective policies.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Mr. Ishihama analyzed the China problem from another perspective, purely from the current issues of the people's livelihood and the wartime economy in China, with expert investigation and research, which can be said to be the most meaningful. Mr. Ishihama correctly raised the issue of goods and prices, the issue that currency should be prevented from inflating, and the issue that the production of goods must be strengthened, especially pointing out that speculation and hoarding in the current economic crisis are not the cause of the economic crisis, but only one of the results of unsound economic development. This is a penetrating argument, and it is exactly what we have always been willing to speak frankly and directly to the authorities. We have always believed that if the China problem is not solved, the Sino-Japanese relationship will never return to its original state, so as to jointly complete the great cause of East Asian liberation. The crux of the China problem lies in winning the hearts of the people to overthrow the Chongqing regime's long-term strategy of attrition warfare; the focus of the problem of winning the hearts of the people (which should absolutely not be buying the hearts of the people) lies in the solution of economic problems in the peace zones, in the improvement and upward mobility of the people's livelihood in the peace zones, especially in the completion of the increased production of goods and the realization of price policies. After the people have truly achieved a peaceful and prosperous life, King Wen of Zhou established an empire that lasted for eight hundred years with only fifty miles of territory. How much more so is it today, when the peace zones have occupied the richest areas of the country? The "problem of Japanese people in China" is indeed a major factor that affects the success or failure of Sino-Japanese relations. Although Mr. Ishihama's words here focus on his hopes for the Japanese people, it can also be seen that the Japanese people are sincere about the new policy. He frankly said: "Even without relying on military protection, they can live and do business as long as privileges or rights and interests are not within the scope of expulsion. Therefore, it is necessary to clearly understand the whole nature of the policy change before activities can be carried out." We should pay special attention to Mr. Ishihama's advice to the Japanese people; however, at the same time, we should also awaken the Chinese people's belief in the Japanese and their sense of responsibility for mutual love and mutual assistance like hands and feet.</p>
<p>In addition to economy, we believe that the key to solving the Sino-Japanese problem lies only in cultural work. Mr. Okamoto's "The Path That Sino-Japanese Culture Should Take" analyzes the historical relationship between Chinese culture and Japanese culture and the reality that they cannot be forcibly unified in an extremely objective and frank manner, and correctly points out: "For cultural exchange, on the one hand, there is such a common foundation, and on the other hand, the condition must be mutually different cultures. If the two are not heterogeneous cultures, then there is no power for mutual exchange. Therefore, when we think about the future of Sino-Japanese culture, we must first develop its heterogeneity (personality), ensure the reason for mutual existence, and not infringe on the other side by a hair's breadth. Only by recognizing and guaranteeing this heterogeneity can we expect cultural exchange and mutual development." This can be said to be the eternal manifesto, oath, and work program of Sino-Japanese cultural workers.</p>
<p>The focus of the "China Problem in the Era of the Greater East Asia War" is only the four words "winning the hearts of the people." Mr. Sugimura's view is correct. However, "winning the hearts of the people" is definitely not the same as "buying the hearts of the people." Therefore, negatively speaking, "using Japan's huge sums of money to buy the hearts of the Chinese people, if it is believed that the people, although incited by anti-Japanese propaganda, will praise the government as soon as there is an opportunity or cheap way to satisfy their appetite," of course, this is not winning the hearts of the people, but only winning the hearts of a very small number of opportunists. Once this opportunity no longer exists, they will also leave in disappointment. Moreover, grasping the opportunists will certainly further alienate the true and long-lasting hearts, which is an inevitable principle. However, is the Chongqing regime taking this dead end? Mr. Sugimura said: "The anti-Japanese government is constantly working to stimulate the people's desire for profit. At the same time, Britain and the United States are returning their own rights and interests to buy people's hearts, thinking about all kinds of opportunities, and intending to be generous with Japan's rights and interests for the Chinese people, and constantly catering to the anti-Japanese government. This is the reason for the China Incident and the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War." Regarding this section, the fact that Britain and the United States lured the anti-Japanese government, and that the anti-Japanese government took advantage of the opportunity, is 100% true. However, if it is said that the anti-Japanese government is buying the people and "constantly stimulating the people's desire for profit," we should recognize that it is not true. Except for a few people who eat anti-Japanese food and make money from the national crisis, the majority of the people—the people under the anti-Japanese regime—only suffer all kinds of actual pain and sacrifice, and no one will think that resistance is a profitable business. It is a completely wrong conclusion to explain the support of a part of the Chinese people for resistance by pursuing their desire for profit. Therefore, in the same way, using "stimulating the people's desire for profit" to persuade the people in the peace zones to cooperate with Japan will not achieve a truly beneficial effect for both countries. Mr. Sugimura said that after the Greater East Asia War, the "true solution" to the China problem "is only the national government that cooperates with Japan, and here we can say how to grasp the focus of the people's hearts." However, we should also add to this conclusion, that is, this is said from the perspective of the national government to the Chongqing regime. To grasp the hearts of the people, it is natural to leave the Chongqing regime and take the national government as the target, but is the national government the focus of the Chinese people's hearts? Obviously, it still awaits the joint efforts of the national government and the folk leaders!</p>
<p>Among Mr. Okamoto's theory of "cultural movement" and Mr. Sugimura's "winning the hearts of the people," one of the most important items is "how to win the hearts of Chinese youth?" On this point, Mr. Okamoto has provided us with an extremely correct theory and pointed out the most open path. Mr. Okamoto observed the China problem not from the superficial and partial phenomena, but from the internal and comprehensive content, so what he grasped must be the core of all problems. He clearly pointed out: "I think, in their—referring to Chinese youth—spirit of abandoning the spirit of modern urban civilization and living in poor rural areas, we can see China decades later. Because I firmly believe that they will be the responsible persons for the future Chinese culture and politics. If, a few years later, East Asia restores peace, and the opponents who associate with us and compete with us in the cultural field are only them. We must deeply remember this." Today, when we talk about winning the hearts of the people, it is certainly not all this generation, but indeed, from a broader perspective, we have to admit that the reason why this generation of young people has emerged and persisted in their aspirations is the highest manifestation of the spirit of the Chinese nation, and it is the truest manifestation of the Chinese people's hearts. If we want to talk about "winning the hearts of the people," we should truly start from this point, which is the fundamentally correct direction. As for the method of grasping, the Chongqing government failed, because, as Mr. Okamoto said: "For those who bear the fate of the nation and face a realistic life, no matter how good your skills are, you will not attract their attention," "we have never heard of an example in human history of moving people's hearts with tricks." Therefore, we also sincerely express Mr. Okamoto's heartfelt voice: "If a policy, action, and words cannot resonate in the hearts of Japanese people who have the same history, nation, and era as us, and cannot move Chinese youth, it is because of the difference in national and historical traditions, and also because they are the opponents in the war. We must deeply consider this point. What achievements have been made in these six years of war?" "If Japan can grasp the hearts of Chinese youth in the near future, it can only be realized when we use a spirit of universal love, generosity, and humility for the individual and the country, and even for all mankind, and our true meaning of hard struggle moves the soul of the Chinese people, and only then will the smell of gunpowder that has disappeared on the mainland naturally."</p>
<p>We believe that the solution to Sino-Japanese relations or the so-called China problem should not seek conclusions based on preconceived ideal policies and slogans, because the result will inevitably be completely wrong. Therefore, we must start from the actual situation of the other party, that is, have the courage to face reality, not be afraid to observe the other party's true face, heart and liver, and the true meaning of their actions, and then dissect and study them. Only then will we reach a true conclusion, and only that kind of conclusion will powerfully promote policy and realize the ideals of both of us. Perhaps this can be said to be Mr. Okamoto's "historical spirit of new conscience." Thank you to Chuo Koron for publishing these articles, which let us know that in Japan, "there are honest people who are racking their brains everywhere now," but in China, how few are the people who are willing to seriously observe and rack their brains!</p>

<h3>Deng Ziyu and Others Swore in Yesterday; Jiangxi Provincial Government Established in Jiujiang; National Government Representative Xu Suzhong Gave Instructions; Governor Deng Announced Policy Guidelines</h3>
<p>Jiujiang, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Jiangxi Provincial Government held its establishment ceremony at 9:00 AM on the 17th in the Provincial Government Auditorium. Attendees included Governor Deng Ziyu, mayors and county chiefs, and representatives of the army and navy. After the meeting began, the governor led the directors of various departments and bureaus in taking an oath. National Government Representative Xu Wenguan, Suzhong, gave an instructional speech, followed by speeches from guests and a response from the governor. The meeting concluded at 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>Jiujiang, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Jiangxi Provincial Government held its establishment ceremony in Jiujiang today. The ceremony was very grand. In addition to addressing the public at the celebration meeting, Governor Deng also gave an inaugural speech. The Jiangxi Provincial Government also issued a declaration of establishment. The main points of Governor Deng's inaugural speech and address to the public celebration meeting are recorded below:</p>
<p>Main points of Governor Deng's inaugural speech: In promoting provincial affairs, I will base my efforts on local needs and financial resources, striving to achieve results as opportunities arise. In the future, special attention should be paid to the following points: (1) To establish security and protect the people's livelihood, it is necessary to strictly implement the Baojia system. A thorough household registration should be conducted to ensure that criminals have no place to hide, so that the people of Jiangxi can live and work in peace. (2) The exchange of goods within the province is not smooth, resulting in a shortage of goods. On the positive side, we must develop transportation, regulate finance, and facilitate the flow of goods. On the negative side, we must crack down on unscrupulous merchants hoarding goods and register goods for distribution. (3) In the past, the distribution of salt in the province was unreasonable. In the future, the government plans to manage it uniformly and distribute it equally according to Baojia. As for the recent shortage of rice in the province, we should actively seek remedies, on the one hand, reclaiming wasteland to increase production, and on the other hand, saving consumption and distributing reasonably. To facilitate the supply and demand of salt and rice, it is also planned to establish cooperative enterprises, setting up more cooperative societies in counties, districts, townships, and towns, to eliminate the current bad situation. (4) The province has suffered from the incident, not only has the provincial government been neglected, but also many farms, factories, and businesses have gone bankrupt. In the future, restoring the countryside and revitalizing the market will be essential plans. Reorganizing taxes and abolishing exorbitant levies are also key points for revitalizing industry, and we should urge their implementation. (5) In the future, the province's education must be vigorously restored to cultivate talents for use. (6) It is heard that the habits of smoking and gambling are rampant in the province, which is shocking. In the future, they must be strictly prohibited and eliminated. As for the harm caused by prostitution, we should also strictly prevent it. (7) To this day, some people in Jiangxi may still blindly believe in resistance, or have always been particularly devoted, but cannot temporarily escape the control of the Chongqing side. Continuing to be obsessed and follow the old ways is not only misleading the country, but also misleading themselves. We hope that they will realize this as soon as possible, quickly return, and jointly participate in the great cause of restoring China and defending East Asia. (8) To quickly achieve the purpose of restoring China and defending East Asia, it is necessary to practice the New National Movement. I am willing to take the New National Movement Outline as the only way to restore governance and rule the people. At the same time, I hope that all compatriots in the province will deeply understand the New National Movement Outline and practice it in their own lives. As weapons, we are willing to work hard to promote them and implement them in an orderly manner. In short, we should all be loyal and diligent under the leadership of the highest leader and chairman in all matters that benefit the country and the people.</p>
<p>Main points of Governor Deng's address to the public celebration meeting: At the public celebration meeting, Governor Deng gave a sincere address, using the three points of realizing comprehensive peace, cooperating in the Greater East Asia War, and implementing the New National Movement to encourage the public to restore China and defend East Asia.</p>

The full text of Minister Lin's speech on the 18th is recorded below:</p>
<p>Minister Lin's Speech</p>
<p>Fellow Delegates: The East Asia Broadcasting Liaison Conference is holding its second meeting today. The front-line fighters of the entire East Asia ideological war, having traveled great distances from Japan, Manchukuo, and various parts of North and South China, have gathered in our nation's capital, Nanjing. There are a total of 35 units of propaganda and broadcasting organizations participating in this conference, with more than 70 delegates in attendance. Today, we see among you, delegates, a spirit of sincere unity within a serious attitude. Standing on the overall position of defending East Asia, you are expressing your sincerity and reviewing the future broadcasting strategies. I believe that this will have a great impact on the final victory of the entire war and the steady progress of the new post-war order, which has already filled my heart with infinite excitement. Thinking that during the continuation of the Greater East Asia War, which is also during the unfolding of Greater East Asia construction, our friendly nations are not only constantly striving to obtain glorious war results, but also placing great expectations on the National Government and providing great assistance, for which I cannot help but express my deepest gratitude. Broadcasting is extremely important in ideological construction in peacetime, and it is even more important in wartime. The popularization of the meaning of the war, the raising of war emotions, and the reporting of the war situation all require the use of radio waves to convey all of this to achieve the final goal of the war. In the propaganda policy of each country, broadcasting must be placed in the most important link. Among national groups, in terms of cooperation in the war, it is even more necessary to cooperate closely with a consistent spirit to form a radio wave defense line for protecting the national group. How can we establish close connections with each other, and how can we consolidate this radio wave front? This is the greatest significance of holding today's Broadcasting Liaison Conference, which must be discussed sincerely. In our discussions and liaison, we need to pay special attention not only to technical aspects, but also to reaching a consensus on the content of the broadcasts. In my personal opinion, in order to achieve the above-mentioned goals and to pay attention to the effectiveness of the broadcasts, it seems that we should tailor the content of the programs to the needs of each environment, adapt to the psychology of the general public, and start with the interests of broadcasting in order to win over the majority of listeners and receive our propaganda. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, we have already known that this is a war of liberation for the East Asian peoples. Each East Asian country must contribute all its human and material resources and fulfill its due responsibilities for its own survival, because modern warfare is a war of total strength. In addition to having the necessary military strength, we must also have the spirit of the entire nation as the greatest guarantee for the victory of the war. In the future, East Asian broadcasting should focus on this point, striving to awaken East Asian national consciousness and mobilize the East Asian national spirit together and constantly. This is the second important significance of this conference. Recently, the Chinese side, through the Supreme National Defense Council, promulgated the Outline of Wartime Cultural Propaganda Policy by the National Government, which determines the entire direction of Chinese wartime culture, and the strengthening of the broadcasting industry also occupies a very important part under this fundamental policy outline. In the future, the Chinese broadcasting industry will naturally advance according to the instructions of this basic policy outline. It is hoped that propaganda workers and broadcasting workers from friendly nations will constantly assist in this ideological war program and its development, so that the construction of China's new cultural propaganda industry can be completed quickly. I sincerely wish you all good health and unlimited future, and I wish the East Asian broadcasting industry an unlimited future.</p>
<h3>Pang Bingxun Announces His Participation in the Peace Movement</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – A Central News Agency reporter visited General Gong Bingxun yesterday to inquire about his impressions of this trip to Nanjing. He graciously gave the following statement: I am willing to express with twelve points of enthusiasm my experience and feelings about participating in this peace movement. I have devoted myself to the Party and the country and have been in the military for more than twenty years. I only know the country and do not know the individual. I will spare no sacrifice as long as it benefits the motherland. After the July 7th Incident, I believed that the country could not be saved without resistance, so I fought in Cangzhou, Taierzhuang, eastern Henan, and southern Shanxi battlefields, in hundreds of battles, both large and small. In 1940, I was ordered to cross north and suppress the Communists. I struggled for three and a half years in the Taihang Mountains in a difficult environment without food or ammunition. The situation in which the loyal comrades I led fought against the communist bandits was extremely tragic, which is well known to the people of the country. In 1942 alone, there were as many as thirty-one senior cadres killed by the communist bandits in Hebei Province. The Communist Party is an internal threat to China and a disaster to East Asia. Britain and the United States are the common enemies of China and Japan and the common enemies of the new order. Therefore, I advocate internal pacification and external resistance, as this is the only way for China and East Asia to save themselves. Therefore, China and Japan must cooperate closely and share weal and woe, resist Britain and the United States externally, and eliminate the communist bandits internally, otherwise the future is unimaginable. Since the National Government returned to its capital, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, all constructions have presented a vigorous and new national atmosphere. The positive assistance of friendly nations to the National Government, such as the abolition of extraterritorial rights and the return of concessions, is clear evidence of sincerity and facts. I have since determined that peace is the only way to save the country, so I am determined to make the greatest effort for peace and the suppression of the Communists. I was greatly encouraged after visiting Chairman Wang and receiving instructions, and I can only pledge allegiance and contribute everything to the motherland. However, my ability is limited, and I am afraid that I will fail to meet the ardent expectations of my compatriots. I hope that comrades from all walks of life will give me more guidance. I am deeply uneasy about the kind reception I received from various leaders, friends, and journalists when I came to Nanjing, and I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Expeditionary Force Announces the War Situation for One Week</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese Expeditionary Force in China announced the war situation for the week on the 18th as follows: The Japanese army's summer offensive has achieved great results. After achieving its goals, it continued to implement a reversal operation to destroy the Chongqing side's magnetic tactics. The Chongqing side judged that the Japanese army's operation was an offensive into the Chongqing side's hinterland, so it felt quite distressed; however, unexpectedly, the Japanese army suddenly reversed, and thus became active again. It seems that it is now working hard to exaggerate its propaganda. However, according to the Chongqing side's broadcast on the 7th of this month, it was said that the Chongqing army felt the inferiority of its quality in this operation. Also, according to those who recently returned from the Chongqing side's hinterland, the Sichuan army in the hinterland is extremely dissatisfied because various treatments are worse than the central army, and an unstable phenomenon has appeared. Also, a part of the Sichuan system (50th) army in Zhejiang Province has also been shaken due to the same situation. It is said that the Chongqing side is mistreating and discriminating against these local armies and oppressing them. Now, the unstable conditions in various places are emerging one after another, which may affect Jiang's leadership.</p>
<p>Hankou, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – After the start of the Japanese army's summer offensive operation, the Chongqing Fifth War Zone wanted to contain the Japanese army's offensive from the side, so the Chongqing army's 22nd Army Group (the 3rd Division) invaded the vicinity north of Wangcheng. After learning of this, the Japanese army immediately launched an attack at dawn on the 2nd, inflicting heavy damage on the Chongqing army, and then reversed to its original location. When the Chongqing army took another stupid move, the Japanese army started to move again on the 13th, and completed the encirclement net at Renhedian on the afternoon of the 14th, crushing the main force of the Chongqing army's one division. In this battle, the Chongqing army lost 856 dead and 857 captured, and seized 3 mortars and 8 heavy and light machine guns.</p>
<h3>General Situation of the Recent Progress of the National Youth Movement</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – On the third anniversary of the National Government's return to its capital, the National Government formed the China Youth League and the China Youth Model League respectively. The China Youth Movement has joined forces with the youth leagues of Japan and Manchukuo to actively prepare for a surprise attack in order to strive to complete the war to liberate East Asia. On New Year's Day last year, Chairman Wang instructed the people of the country that the government was determined to work hard to ensure public security and improve people's livelihood, and at the same time hoped that the people would rise up and work together to complete the Greater East Asia War and promote the New National Movement. Subsequently, in mid-June last year, the New National Movement Promotion Committee was officially established. Under the personal leadership of Chairman Wang, it has been actively active, and the spirit of unity among the people has become increasingly high. At the same time, the people's determination to complete the war has also been strengthened. At that time, Chairman Wang deeply felt that the rapid and strong progress of the New National Movement depended on the young people who are the masters of the new China. Therefore, he changed his past laissez-faire attitude towards the youth movement and placed the China Youth League and the China Boy Scouts directly under the New National Movement Promotion Committee, and reorganized them to strengthen their lineup. On January 9th of this year, when the National Government resolutely rose up to participate in the war, it felt that promoting the New Movement was an urgent task. Therefore, after participating in the war, it immediately established the Central Youth Cadre School in Nanjing to train leaders for young people. In order to merge the China Youth League and the Boy Scouts to enhance the consolidated unity and promotion, it was decided to organize the China Youth League with the students of various schools as the main body, and to organize the China Youth Model League with hard-working young people as the center, as a group to practice the New Movement. After this policy was decided, 5,248 elementary schools, 345 middle schools, 19 normal schools, 4 universities, and 5 independent colleges in various places immediately mobilized the students to form youth teams or juvenile teams. On March 30th, the third anniversary of the National Government's return to its capital, 15,000 outstanding youth representatives from all over the country gathered at the Xiaoying Training Ground in Nanjing to hold the founding ceremony of the China Youth League and the China Youth Model League, and Chairman Wang awarded the league flags separately. On the same day, youth representatives from Japan and Manchukuo also participated in the grand ceremony. At this point, the China Youth Movement launched a groundbreaking activity under the new organization. Subsequently, Chairman Wang personally attended the first general review after the establishment of the Youth League. That night, youth representatives from China, Japan, and Manchukuo held a conference to decide to form the East Asia Youth League with the youth leagues of the three countries as the main body, so that the youth leagues of all East Asia would become one. The National Government also set May 5th as Youth Day to launch the Youth Movement to awaken the youth of the country. On this day, the National Youth League held sports meets in various places, showing the vigorous spirit of the Chinese youth everywhere. The spirit of all the youth in the new China was thus uplifted, and they are now, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, marching forward in an orderly manner and unanimously towards the road of completing the liberation of East Asia and defeating Britain and the United States.</p>

<h3>Indian Leader Bose Arrives in Tokyo; Asks Japan for Cooperation in Liberating India; Firmly Believes Indian People Will Resort to Armed Resistance When Necessary; Expresses Gratitude to Prime Minister Tojo for Concern About Indian Independence</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Indian independence movement leader Chandra Bose met with the press corps at the Imperial Hotel here at 2:00 p.m. on the 19th and issued a statement explaining the purpose of his visit to Japan and his belief in seeking Indian independence. He also answered various questions raised by the press corps. Bose has decided to deliver enthusiastic radio speeches to the 400 million people of India and Germany. He is scheduled to broadcast to India in English, Hindi, and Bengali on the 21st, and to Germany in Hindi and German on the 22nd. On the 23rd, he will give a speech entitled "Motherland India" at the Japan Imperial Rule Assistance Political Society, asking the Japanese political community to understand and cooperate in the Indian liberation movement.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The main points of the question-and-answer session between Chandra Bose and the press corps are as follows: (Q) What are the strategies for Indian independence? (A) Although there are strategies, I cannot say for sure at this time. The Indian people will never adopt a non-resistance policy forever. I firmly believe that they will resort to armed resistance when necessary. Indians residing abroad will maintain strong organizations to assist organizations within India. (Q) Does India need foreign assistance to achieve independence? (A) Given Britain's strength and the collusion of the United States, and Churchill's repeated requests for assistance from Roosevelt, it is natural for India to accept external assistance in order to seek independence. (Q) How will Myanmar's independence affect India? (A) Myanmar's independence has had a tremendous impact on India. I firmly believe that this is at least the most effective answer to the anti-Axis propaganda strategy towards India. (Q) What is the motive for this visit to Japan? (A) I believe that strengthening various independent movements outside of India is necessary for the internal independent movement of India to proceed rapidly. Although I am incapable, I am willing to do my best. (Q) What is your impression of the meeting with Prime Minister Tojo? (A) Prime Minister Tojo is extremely concerned about Indian independence and is determined to provide the greatest assistance possible within his means, for which I am extremely grateful. (Q) How will the state of Indian independence be formed? (A) This will all be achieved through India's own efforts and sacrifices. The Indian people are launching a struggle with power from the bottom of their hearts, and I am extremely optimistic about this. Regarding the people, my personal feeling is that they are determined to push the independent movement to the end, and the power of the current military action will inevitably be extremely strong.</p>
<p>Manila, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Salini, the leader of the Manila Indian Independence League, was extremely pleased to hear of Chandra Bose's arrival in Japan and issued a statement saying in essence that Chandra Bose's trip to Japan was a great blow to Britain, but on the contrary, it was a great boon to the Indian people fighting for independence. The fact that he arrived in Japan under the reverence and anticipation of the entire Indian nation is not only exciting to the Indians in East Asia, but also to the Indians living around the world. He can be said to be the only successor to Gandhi. His return to East Asia will make the Indians who are fighting for liberation under the tyrannical politics of Britain redouble their efforts. Moreover, he was born in Bengal, the birthplace of the Indian independence movement, so this trip will make the Indians in Bengal even more confident of gaining freedom. It is expected that the day when India gains independence is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Yangon, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) – After learning that Chandra Bose had arrived in Japan, the Myanmar Regional Committee of the Indian Independence League immediately convened a cadre meeting and unanimously adopted a telegram of congratulations, the text of which is as follows: The Indians stationed in Myanmar, having learned that you have arrived safely in Japan, are delighted and eagerly hope to strive for the great goal of liberating India under your leadership.</p>
<h3>Biography of Indian Leader Bose</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – A brief biography of Jiantela Bose, a major figure in the Indian independence movement, is as follows: Born near Calcutta in 1897, he studied at Cambridge University in 1920. After graduating from Cambridge, he participated in Gandhi's non-cooperation movement and returned to his country, where he was elected as a member of the executive committee of the National Congress Party. In 1923, he formed a radical faction within the National Congress Party, and in 1924, he served as the president of the Calcutta Municipal Council. In 1927, he was arrested and detained in Varanasi, but was released due to illness. In 1930, he served as the Mayor of Calcutta. In 1931, while still serving as mayor, he was severely injured and arrested and imprisoned for leading a parade and being beaten by police. In 1933, he was released once, but soon arrested again. At this time, public demonstrations gradually intensified. In 1933, he was released again on the condition of traveling abroad and went to Vienna. In 1936, disregarding government warnings, he returned to his country and was immediately arrested upon arriving in Mumbai. In 1937, while still in custody, he was released again due to illness. In the following two months, he traveled to Europe for a short period, proving that the British government's policy toward India had not changed. In 1938, he was elected as the president of the Indian National Congress Party. In 1939, due to popular support, he was re-elected as president, but was forced to resign due to attacks from within the Congress Party. After that, he formed the Forward Bloc within the Congress Party, declaring opposition to compromise with the British and preparing for armed resistance. In April 1940, he led the Forward Bloc to begin a non-cooperation movement, and was arrested in July. While in prison, he was elected as a member of the Central Legislative Assembly. In 1941, he went on a hunger strike to demand his release and was soon released. On January 26 of the same year, he was reported missing. In 1942, after Singapore was captured by the Japanese army, he suddenly broadcast a radio message to the Indian people in secret, saying that he had now joined forces with Japan and the Axis powers to overthrow the British and achieve complete independence.</p>
<h3>German Foreign Minister Sends Congratulations to Bose</h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop issued the following telegram to Jiantela Bose, who is currently staying in Japan: I am pleased to hear of your arrival in Japan. When you left Germany, you sent sincere telegrams to President Hitler and myself. I am grateful for your belief in vowing to cooperate with Germany and advance towards fighting our common enemy. We are even more convinced that you will continue to strive for the liberation of the Indian people and believe that you will surely succeed.</p>
<h3>London Officially Appoints Wavell as Viceroy of India, General Auchinleck Succeeds Him as Commander-in-Chief of India</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency) – Last night, London officially announced that General Sir Archibald Wavell has been appointed as the Viceroy of India, succeeding Lord Linlithgow. General Auchinleck will succeed Wavell as Commander-in-Chief of India. The issue that has been discussed by the British public and government officials for over a year has finally been resolved. The current Viceroy of India, Lord Linlithgow, took office in April 1936 and was originally scheduled to complete his term in 1940. However, in view of the outbreak of war and the tense situation in India, his term was repeatedly extended until now. Linlithgow's administration in India has been subject to strict criticism, especially the criticism in the House of Commons this year, accusing him of being incapable of promoting understanding between the Indian government and the Indian people. When Sir Stafford Cripps held negotiations with the leaders of the Indian National Congress and the All-India Muslim League, Linlithgow's attitude was also severely criticized by London. In fact, Linlithgow's most staunch opponents were the prominent leaders of the Congress Party. As for Auchinleck's succession to Wavell in commanding the Indian anti-Axis forces, according to London's explanation, it is merely the restoration of a dismissed general's position, because in August last year, British Prime Minister Churchill blamed Auchinleck for the defeat at Srinagar and removed him from his position as Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in the Middle East. The date of Wavell's inauguration has not yet been announced. This appointment does not surprise Londoners, as rumors of Wavell being appointed as the Viceroy of India have been widespread for a long time.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency) – Last night, London officially announced that the newly appointed Viceroy of India, Wavell, is currently in Britain and will return to India this autumn to take office. General Auchinleck will immediately succeed him as the Commander-in-Chief of India. According to further news from London, the British authorities announced yesterday that Britain will establish an independent military command in East Asia for the specific purpose of conducting war against Japan. The newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of India, Auchinleck, will be relieved of his responsibility for the war against Japan.</p>
<h3>Italian Prime Minister Announces Domestic War Zone</h3>
<p>Rome, 19th (Central News Agency) – According to Stefani News Agency, the official gazette here published yesterday a notice issued by the Italian Prime Minister in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Army, stating that the following areas are included in the war zone: including Focchiabarri, Brindisi, Lecce, Taranto, Cosenza, Crotone, and parts of La Calabria and Molise.</p>
<h3>British King Travels from North Africa to Gibraltar for Inspection</h3>
<p>Madrid, 19th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Larini, the British King has arrived in Gibraltar by plane from North Africa. Governor and Commander-in-Chief General MacFarlane and others all arrived to greet him. After the British King arrived, he immediately began to inspect the fortresses and the garrisons of the soldiers. The British King conducted a thorough inspection with strict security. It is expected that the British King will return to Britain directly from Gibraltar.</p>
<p>Madrid, 19th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Reuters citing Agence Havas, British rescue ship No. 6 arrived in Gibraltar yesterday morning. At the same time, two Swedish cargo ships from the Atlantic Ocean anchored there. In addition, the port currently has two British aircraft carriers, two British battleships, twelve British destroyers, and three American destroyers, all of the latest models. Two British transport ships, which appear to be heading to North Africa, are also currently docked in the port. Yesterday morning, a plane of unknown nationality flew over the port of Gibraltar from south to north. Anti-aircraft guns on the shore and warships immediately fired at it, but missed. The plane soon escaped. Several British fighter planes also took off in pursuit, but soon returned without finding any trace of the foreign plane.</p>
<p>Madrid, 19th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency Larini reported that British King George VI, accompanied by British Secretary of State for War Sir Grigge, inspected the fortresses of Gibraltar and reviewed the exercises yesterday afternoon and has departed from Gibraltar.</p>
<h3>Relations Between de Gaulle and Giraud Not Yet Perfect</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters, the political situation in Algiers has not been resolved as reported by Reuters. On the contrary, since the French National Liberation Committee of de Gaulle and Giraud held its first meeting, the situation seems to be more complicated than before. Local French people claim that conspirators are still active behind the scenes, so the dangerous environment has not yet disappeared. It is reported that a "Center Party" will be established there. United Press International said that its task is to serve as an intermediary between de Gaulle and Giraud. The preliminary work for its establishment has already begun at the first meeting of the Liberation Committee yesterday. It is said that Jardel, Monet, and Massigli, who can influence the policies of de Gaulle and Giraud, will be the backbone of the party. It is expected that most members of the Liberation Committee, regardless of their personal relationship with de Gaulle and Giraud, will belong to the party. It is also learned that the Liberation Committee is scheduled to hold another meeting today to discuss the issue of reorganizing the French army based on democratic principles.</p>
<h3>German-Turkish Friendship Treaty</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 19th (Central News Agency) – According to the German News Agency, Ankara Radio's broadcast on the German-Turkish Friendship Treaty stated that the friendship between Germany and Turkey is based on a long-standing tradition. Germany helped Turkey after the Balkan War, so this friendship treaty that meets the needs of both parties was established.</p>
<h3>Overview of Japan's Wooden Shipbuilding Industry</h3>
<p>The enthusiasm for wooden shipbuilding since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War has been like wildfire, but the general public may not fully realize the ultra-importance of wooden ships at present. There are still many people in the world who think that building wooden ships is of no use. Compared with steel ships, wooden ships are indeed weak and old, and it is not without reason that people arbitrarily despise them. In fact, when the two are compared, wooden ships are ultimately inferior to steel ships in terms of speed, carrying capacity, durability, and seaworthiness.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the current wooden shipbuilding problem, from the perspective of efficiency and economy, is obviously not the focus. However, the wooden ship problem does have the significance of saving iron materials. In this regard, wooden ships and steel ships can be given equal value. Moreover, if the construction of small steel ships is abolished and the steel materials are used for building large wooden-steel hybrid ships, it is beneficial to the national policy.</p>
<p>The steel materials used to build wooden ships are less than one-third of those used to build steel ships, so the steel used to build one steel ship can be used to build three wooden-steel hybrid ships of the same tonnage. In any case, the current ultra-importance of wooden ships has the above-mentioned positive significance.</p>
<p>Therefore, the authorities are naturally making great efforts to build this type of wooden ship with a major mission. The government first divided the wartime standard types of wooden ships from 70 tons to 300 tons into six types. After that, in order to accelerate the construction, it limited them to three types: 250-ton type, 150-ton type, and 100-ton type. At the same time, in order to save materials, eliminate skill requirements, and simplify production, it started to design the hull using a box-shaped design. Thus, efficiency has also been achieved, and the relationship between small 100-ton-class coastal vessels is also sufficient to a certain extent, guiding them to build as many large 250-ton-class wooden ships as possible. Not only that, but recently, wooden-steel hybrid ships of 300 tons and 500 tons are being tested.</p>
<p>At the same time, the control of the wooden shipbuilding industry is also progressing steadily. Terajima, the Minister of Communications, said the most important thing at the 81st Diet session regarding this point:</p>
<p>"Although there are thousands of wooden shipyards across the country, they are all small in scale, and very few employ more than 100 workers. Most only have less than 10 workers. The Ministry of Communications intends to integrate these thousands of shipyards into hundreds of shipyards. Also, when building standard ships, each individual shipyard is too small, so it will gather separate combinations to establish a national federation, place it under unified management, and make this National Wooden Shipbuilding Federation a member of the Shipbuilding Federation, participating in shipbuilding plans."</p>
<p>According to the explanation of the Minister of Communications, the scale of wooden shipbuilding was extremely fragmented and small in the past, and it is quite difficult to bring them together and make them highly productive. This is also the case with engine parts produced in many town factories. The government is advising the field of wooden shipbuilding to adopt a large-scale approach. Responding to the government, many powerful enterprises and companies, such as Nippon Yusen, Osaka Shosen, Yamashita Kisen, Mitsui Bussan, Kawasaki Kisen, Kuribayashi Shosen, Hakodate Dock, Oji Paper, and Panasonic Electric, have newly established wooden shipbuilding companies. Below are a few of the newly established large-scale companies:</p>
<p>Mitsui Bussan Co., Ltd. established the affiliated Mitsui Wooden Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. (capital of 10 million yen), with a total of nine yards in Iwate Prefecture, Mie Prefecture, Kagawa Prefecture, Shimane Prefecture, Aomori Prefecture, Oita Prefecture, Tottori Prefecture, etc. Nippon Yusen Co., Ltd. has jointly established Ariake Shipbuilding, Kaisen Shipbuilding, Chugoku Shipbuilding, and Nankai Shipbuilding with local operators in Wakayama, Kagoshima, Oita, Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Tokushima, and other six prefectures. Kuribayashi Shosen Co., Ltd. has jointly established East Japan Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. (capital of 10 million yen) with Oji Paper Co., Ltd. and Hakodate Dock Co., Ltd., and is building a factory in Kushiro City. Osaka Shosen Co., Ltd. has separately established Hōkoku Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. (capital of 5 million yen) and is engaged in construction in Ishikawa Prefecture. Yamashita Kisen Co., Ltd. has newly established K.K. Kudamatsu Shipyard (capital of 5 million yen) in Yamaguchi Prefecture, and Kawasaki Kisen Co., Ltd. has newly established Miyagi Wooden Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. (capital of 10 million yen). Furthermore, Panasonic Electric Co., Ltd., which was originally an electrical appliance company, has also established Panasonic Shipyard (10 million yen) and is building factories in Akita and Osaka, which is quite noteworthy.</p>
<p>According to this large-scale progress, Japan's most urgent mass production of large wooden ships and wooden-steel hybrid ships will be realized in the future. At the same time, the adoption of this new method will also provide fresh stimulation to the above-mentioned small and medium-sized enterprises' stubborn and outdated methods. Large enterprises, especially zaibatsu, do not contribute much to their shipbuilding departments in terms of enterprise by building wooden ships. However, the active participation of powerful people is very necessary at this time, and it is a unique wartime color that has never been seen in the Japanese shipbuilding industry in the past, which is quite interesting.

<h3>Minister Ding of the Ministry of Social Welfare Discusses "Thrift" and "Disaster Relief," Expresses Support for This Newspaper's Frugal Banquet Covenant</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) Minister Ding of the Ministry of Social Welfare has arrived in Shanghai. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially went to interview him. Yang talked about frugality and disaster relief. Minister Ding's speech is as follows:</p>
<p>"I have always advocated thrift, because thrift is frugality, and frugality is a virtue. So-called frugality to cultivate virtue, I advocate that not only should we be frugal in terms of material things, but also in terms of time, energy, and desires and fame and wealth. We should be frugal not only in times of war when there is a shortage of material things, but also in peacetime. Not only should the general public be frugal, but especially public officials should be frugal. The so-called honest and upright customs are all cultivated by frugality. The ancient Chinese all had a frugal style. There is no need to cite distant examples. Even Zeng Wenzhenggong, a modern person familiar to everyone, attached great importance to frugality and practiced it himself. He said, 'If the official kitchen has one less pair of chopsticks, the people will have one more point of strength.' This proves that officials who can be frugal can pacify the people. He also said, 'If you want to learn honesty and integrity, you must first know contentment. Seeing the famine victims everywhere, we should feel fortunate to live in peace and have good food. Why should we be extravagant? Why should we waste?' These words are in line with what Mr. Zhou Fohai recently said in his 'Miscellaneous Feelings on Four Visits to Beiping': 'The food problem in North China is very serious. I often think that I have no special enjoyment, but I eat three meals a day and sleep on a bed at night. Now that I think about it, I am already blessed by God. Having three meals a day means I don't have to eat grass roots and tree leaves. Having a bed to sleep on at night means I don't have to sleep on cement. Isn't this special enjoyment? In special enjoyment, we must never forget the suffering of the people.' The above is worth everyone's special vigilance. Therefore, I personally attach great importance to frugality and often use it to encourage myself and my colleagues."</p>
<p>"There are many ways to practice thrift. I always think that the most important thing is for everyone to first cultivate a spirit of thrift. I very much agree with the many opinions put forward in the Shen Bao recently, especially the method of the covenant to save banquet expenses. It is even more necessary. People like Li Zanhhou, Yuan Ludeng, Wen Lanting, and Tang Shoumin have all participated. I think it will definitely be widely promoted. Chairman Wang has already implemented simple banquets and prohibited public officials from entertaining guests with public funds. When I personally entertain guests, most of the food is cooked by the family cook, and there are very few dishes. Everything is simple and crude." "According to the general phenomenon now, on the part of the host, it is considered that rich dishes and grand banquets are not enough to express sincerity, and some vulgar people also regard rich dishes and grand banquets as 'showing off'. This kind of mentality is really not very clever and should be changed urgently. We must cultivate a new spirit of 'taking simplicity and frugality as honor and extravagance and waste as shame'. If everyone does this, it can be popularized over time." Speaking of this, I want to cite Zeng Wenzhenggong as an example again. He said, "Those who are greedy cannot be frugal, and those who are restless cannot be frugal. Greed such as good clothes, good food, good sounds, good colors, calligraphy, paintings, antiques, etc., can all waste the family." But Wenzhenggong himself said that he has never had any hobbies, but he has the drawback of being restless. Today he thinks of doing something, and tomorrow he thinks of visiting a guest, so the expenses increase day by day without realizing it. Later, he emphasized thrift and frugality, and warned himself to not be restless and not go out easily, not start things easily, and not only not do useless things, but also not easily take action to repair bridges, roads, temples, Taoist temples, and charities. Secondly, he said, "Servants should be few, so that those who eat will be few. Affection should be reduced, so that those who use will be comfortable. Otherwise, if we are not frugal today, we will inevitably owe more debts in the future. We will not only owe debts to friends, but also leave debts to our children and grandchildren." Therefore, if we can get rid of greed and restlessness, we can practice simplicity."</p>
<p>Finally, regarding disaster relief, Mr. Ding also put forward his opinions, saying,</p>
<p>"This time, all sectors of Shanghai have been very enthusiastic about donating to the disaster relief in North China, which is really admirable. I hope that the wealthy people in Shanghai will contribute more generously, but those who are too busy to make a profit can not be forced to do so. Secondly, I hope that the wealthy people will participate in the thrift movement, reduce all daily waste, and accumulate little by little to make a huge drink to help disaster relief, which is a win-win situation."</p>
<h3>Price of Household Rice Rises, Two Liters of Rice Now Sold for Nine Yuan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued Notice No. 6393, stating that Rice and Flour Certificate No. 38 will be valid until the 19th of this month and will be invalid after the expiration date. From the 22nd to the 29th of this month, rice shops and the Council's rice sales offices will only sell rice and flour upon presentation of Rice and Flour Certificate No. 39. At that time, rice shops with registered numbers on the certificates will sell one and a half liters of white rice or half-coarse rice, plus half a liter of broken rice or brown rice (totaling two liters), for nine yuan per rice certificate. In addition, twelve taels of No. 2 flour and four taels of No. 3 flour will be sold for four yuan and eight jiao per flour certificate. Furthermore, rice shops and the Council's rice sales offices will be temporarily closed for two days on the 21st and 30th of this month.</p>
<h3>Record of Donations for Longevity Celebrations</h3>
<p>Today is the eightieth birthday of Mr. Gao Hanqing. Mr. Gao is a firm believer in Christian doctrines. His accomplishments in life are too numerous to recount. He has lived in Hongkou for generations, and his family was poor. In his childhood, he experienced many hardships. At the age of eleven, he entered the Qingxin Free School in Nanmen, studying while working part-time, focusing on the art of printing. This later became the foundation for his dedication to society and the promotion of Chinese culture. After reaching adulthood, he left school and joined the Meihua Library, where he was in charge of printing. At the age of thirty-four, he co-founded the Commercial Press with Mr. Xia Cuifang, Mr. Bao Xian'en, Mr. Bao Xianchang, and others, serving as General Manager and Supervisor. He still serves as a director today. The starting point of the library was minimal, but with the help of Mr. Zhang Jusheng, Mr. Gao Mengdan, Mr. Li Bake, and others, it developed rapidly. In over forty years, it has become a leading publishing house in the country, occupying an important page in the modern cultural history of China. In 1932, Mr. Xiang Songmao of Wuzhou Pharmacy met with misfortune. Mr. Gao, remembering his old friend, strongly supported Mr. Xiang's son in continuing the old business, serving as Managing Director of the pharmacy. He personally went to work every day, not deterred by his old age. On Fuzhou Road, one could often see the old man walking slowly and leisurely. Mr. Gao is kind-hearted and determined to help orphans and the poor. Therefore, forty years ago, he co-founded the Shanghai Orphanage with Mr. Li Pingshu and Mr. Shen Manyun. Before the Incident, there were more than seven hundred male and female students, occupying more than one hundred acres of land. The talents cultivated in the orphanage are all able to support themselves in society, achieving remarkable results. Today marks Mr. Gao's eightieth birthday. Considering the chaos of the world, he does not wish to celebrate his birthday. His friends jointly initiated a public celebration at 2:00 PM today on the ninth floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. Mr. Gao, being humble, will not accept any gifts and has donated 10,000 yuan to help the disaster victims in the North, which has been sent to the Chinese Christian Association, transferred to the Xinhua Bank for collection. All congratulatory gifts from various circles will also be donated to disaster relief, using the funds for birthday wishes for disaster relief. This is truly a beautiful act of extending longevity to others. It is expected that those who participate in the public celebration will witness a grand occasion.</p>
<h3>Yoshida Toyu's Lecture Yesterday: The Possibility of Resolving the Sino-Japanese Incident</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 19th) at 3:00 PM, the Shanghai Chinese Construction Youth Corps held a symposium on Sino-Japanese issues at the KangLe Hotel. They invited Mr. Yoshida Toyu, a Japanese scholar who has studied Sino-Japanese issues for a long time, to give a lecture on "The Possibility of Resolving the Sino-Japanese Incident." More than fifty people attended, including team members, university students, and guests. Team leader Zhou Paigan presided over the meeting, reporting on the significance of holding the symposium and introducing Mr. Yoshida's lecture.</p>
<p>Summary of the Speech</p>
<p>The main points of Yoshida's speech were: "The famous journalist John Gunther once said in his book 'Inside Asia' that there is no possibility of resolving the Sino-Japanese issue. His reasons are threefold: (1) Japan has a desire to expand its territory, (2) China is unable to drive out the Japanese army, and (3) Japan has many conflicts with European countries. Therefore, he concluded that 'China and Japan will form a permanent war front.' Judging from the current situation, Gunther's words have unfortunately come true. Soldiers of both countries share regrets. During 1936, the 'anti-Japanese' sentiment in China was激昂. The Shanghai National Salvation Association factions, the Communist Party, and the United States and Britain further instigated the Sino-Japanese Incident. At that time, all factions, under the banner of 'unity,' could not oppose Chiang to seek personal benefits. They could only use the name of resisting Japan to attempt to oppose Chiang. The Chiang government could not control the public sentiment for a time, and was unwilling to sacrifice political power. Therefore, it rashly clashed with Japan without considering the consequences. Later, after the fall of Nanjing and Shanghai, the Chiang regime was stationed in Wuhan and had realized that China and Japan should not have a long war. They attempted to find a resolution and organized the Three Principles of the People Youth League, thinking of leading the people towards resolving the incident. The reason why a comprehensive peace between China and Japan has not been achieved to this day is actually due to the obstruction of the United States and Britain and the provocation of the Communist Party. On December 8 of the year, the Greater East Asia War broke out. Japan repeatedly declared its true intentions towards China, and at the same time implemented the abandonment of various rights and interests it had obtained in China, hoping that China and Japan could truly cooperate to defeat the United States and Britain. This measure is now gradually attracting the attention of various parties under the rule of the Chiang regime. Based on this, the possibility of a comprehensive resolution of the Sino-Japanese Incident is no longer remote. Yoshida also solemnly stated that the core of resolving the Sino-Japanese Incident lies in whether the people of the two countries can fully understand each other. If the ideas and intentions of the people of the two countries are inconsistent, even if the Chongqing government can accept the Japanese side's sincerity in cooperation, future conflicts will still be difficult to eliminate. Conversely, if the people of the two countries can be truly friendly, even if the Chongqing government and the United States and Britain and the Communist Party obstruct them, a comprehensive resolution is still very possible. Therefore, our efforts to resolve the incident should proceed rapidly along this path, so that peace in East Asia can reach a permanent and satisfactory state." The lecture lasted for an hour, and the audience was very moved.</p>
<p>Many students who attended raised various questions, and Mr. Yoshida answered them in detail until the meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Recruitment by the Baojia Youth Division</h3>

<p>Economic Circle</p>
<h3>This Newspaper's Economic Circle Symposium</h3>
<p>Date: June 19th, 4:00 PM</p>
<p>Location: KangLe Hotel, Jing'an Temple Road</p>
<p>Attendees: From the Commercial Control Association:</p>
<p>Zhang Peishen (Secretary General of the National Commercial Control Association)</p>
<p>Luo Nazhai (Director of the Materials Department of the Commercial Control Association)</p>
<p>Wu Huanru (Secretary of the Commercial Control Association)</p>
<p>Yu Langxi (Secretary of the Commercial Control Association)</p>
<p>From This Newspaper's Economic Circle:</p>
<p>Li Quan, Shi Pan Yang, Yao Liu Yunfang</p>
<p>Scope of Discussion:</p>
<p>The National Commercial Control Association is the only organization for economic collective autonomy. Until recently, its internal structure was finally completed. However, since the public still does not fully understand the various connections within the internal structure of the Commercial Control Association, as well as the actual situation in the implementation of controlled economic work, what methods should be adopted to ensure that all the contents of the Commercial Control Association are made public?</p>
<p>Decided Methods:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding special reporting value for control work, such as the recent "Wheat Unified Purchase" issue, this newspaper's economic circle will propose an interview, and the Commercial Control Association will be responsible for explaining. (2) Regarding issues such as the Federation of Industry and Commerce Guilds, this newspaper's economic circle will invite responsible persons from various federations to participate in the symposium at any time, and responsible persons from the Commercial Control Association will attend at the same time. (3) Regarding general information on the Commercial Control Association's control work, the Commercial Control Association will issue an irregular publication in the near future, but before each issue, it may first choose to allow this newspaper's economic circle to preview and disclose it.</p>
<p>The above three methods are aimed at showing that all work on the side of the Commercial Control Association is absolutely public. Because the Commercial Control Association, under the supervision and guidance of the government, must strive to complete its collective autonomy mechanism and allow the mother period to be contrary to the spirit of its collective autonomy.</p>
<h3>Materials Investigation Committee Held Inaugural Meeting Yesterday; Approved Office Regulations and Materials Investigators</h3>

<h3>Japanese Industrial and Commercial Organizations in Central China Planning to Establish an Autonomous Control Mechanism</h3>
<p>A total of forty Japanese industrial and commercial organizations in Central China are now jointly planning to establish a non-governmental autonomous control mechanism, whose status is parallel to the Chinese Commercial Control Association. This new trade organization includes authoritative figures from the Japanese business community in the Central China region. The work in the future lies in the official guidance. Cooperate to form a base for wartime economic control, and all enterprise steps such as the production, transportation, sales, and distribution of materials will be within its power. The initiators of this new organization are forty people. A meeting was held at the Japanese Embassy office at 10:00 AM on the 18th of this month, at which Mr. Okazaki, the Director of General Affairs of the Embassy, explained the determination to establish a new organization. And hope that all stakeholders will work together, followed by Mr. Masuoka, the Planning Minister, who gave various instructions on the preparatory procedures for the establishment. Komuro (Mitsui &amp; Co.), Nakamura (Shirokiya), Doi (Yangtze Egg Industry), Fujino (Mitsubishi Corporation), and Hayakawa (Tomen) were selected as five preparatory committee members to carry out preparations.</p>
<h3>Rice and Grain Cooperative Association's Directors and Supervisors Took Office Yesterday; First Handle Rice and Grain Transportation and Distribution</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai District Rice and Grain Cooperative Association was established on the 2nd of this month, the list of directors and supervisors has been submitted to the Flour and Food Department for approval. It has now been approved by the Ministry. There are seven directors and three supervisors. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the elected directors and supervisors held a swearing-in ceremony on the sixth floor of the Pudong Building. The first batch of directors were elected by the Food Department yesterday - Wen Shao, (also Chairman of the Board) Shen Linqing, Chen Shaolian, Huang Zhihe, Xia Tongfu, Yan Jiyun, Gong Mansong. Supervisors Zhu Zhaoqi, Huang Ruyuan, Gu Yisheng. Senior officials present included Director Ji Hua of the Food Department's Shanghai Office, Grain Bureau Representative Wang Daoming, and more than one hundred industry representatives. Director Ji said in his speech, "The directors and supervisors of the Rice and Grain Cooperative Association have now taken office, but when it can start working has not yet been determined. Only after sufficient preparation for the transportation, distribution, people and goods can the Ministry entrust you to start work. At that time, the Central China Rice and Grain Distribution Office will naturally be relieved of its responsibility. The main task of the cooperative association is to prevent speculation, manipulation, and hoarding. In the future, all grain merchants who do not join the cooperative association will not be allowed to participate in buying and selling rice and grain. In other aspects of handling, the cooperative association must also assist in handling with the local administrative organs. As for the relationship between the office and the cooperative association, it is nothing more than (1) guidance (2) supervision (3) assistance (4) support, etc."</p>
<h3>Various Bank Loans to Purchase Wheat for Centralized Distribution</h3>
<p>In order to centralize wheat procurement and improve wheat purchase performance, the National Commercial Control Association has formulated ten articles of the Interim Plan for Unified Wheat Purchase. From now on, the Yam Powder Wheat Professional Committee will intensify its efforts in accordance with the established plan and purchase a large amount of wheat from various parts of Central China.</p>
<p>Unified Purchase of Bumper Wheat Harvest</p>
<p>The wheat in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui has already entered the market this year, and all have reported bumper harvests. China's Communications, Jiaotong, Jin Cheng, Shanghai Zhongfu, Continental, and Zhejiang Xing banks have lent huge amounts of money. The Flour and Wheat Professional Committee has designated areas and sent personnel to various producing areas such as northern Jiangsu, Xuzhou, Wuhu, eastern Zhejiang, and along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, to purchase a large amount of wheat uniformly, and then distribute it centrally. It is expected that the results will be excellent.</p>
<p>Flour Mills in Various Places Will Soon Start Work</p>
<p>It is reported that flour mills in Shanghai, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Hangzhou and other regions, such as Fuxin, Fufeng, Sanxing, Dongfu, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Guangfeng, etc., will fully resume work as soon as the wheat is fully distributed. It is estimated that the wheat in Central China is sufficient for the needs of various flour mills, so the daily output of various flour mills in the future will be considerable, and the food for the entire people can be guaranteed without worry.</p>
<h3>Market Trends for Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Chinese stocks opened weak yesterday morning, but surged strongly upwards near noon. Among the stocks, textiles continued to lead the rise, with Wing On Textiles notably breaking through a significant level. Da Sheng Factories No. 1, 3, Sino-Japanese Textile Mill, and Rong Feng Textiles also showed significant gains. Smaller denomination stocks, such as Xin Feng and Da Zhong Hua Weaving, were also favored by investors. Wing On, Sincere, and China Emporium all showed increased activity, and innerwear also rose. The cultural sector had a surprising surge, with Commercial Press, China Book Co., and World Book Co. rising significantly, and supply was limited. Among public utilities, Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity and China General Edison continued to be favored by buyers. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company reached a new peak after breaking through a significant level, and Da Zhong Hua Match followed suit. In the new pharmaceuticals sector, New Asia remained stable, while Sino-French and others showed slight progress. Kang Yuan Biscuit's price has now firmly established itself outside the customs barrier. Trading volume was low for the remaining stocks.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Call Loan Rate: The Shanghai Bankers Association call loan rate remained unchanged at 20%.</p>
<p>Government Bonds: In the gray market, Government Bonds A, B, C, D, and E all increased.</p>
<p>Gold and Silver: Local silver merchants, including Taishing and its counterparts in the jewelry sector, continued to exchange gold at the limited price, but charged a handling fee. Internal and external trading was active and stronger than before. The official silver price remained unchanged, but internal and external trading prices still exceeded the limited price.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth: Yarn and cloth trading was thin due to the weekend, but those holding goods were speculative, creating a situation where demand exceeded supply. The price of various yarn types continued to rise. The cloth market trend remained firm. After opening higher in the morning, the price of various cloths slightly weakened due to selling by floating holders. As a result, premium fine cloths like "Four Gentlemen," "Peach Blossom," "Miss," "Lin Bai Mao" flower cloth, "Kiwi," and others all showed squeezes upwards.</p>
<h3>What I Know About Mr. Gao Hanqing</h3>
<p>— Zhang Bingruo</p>
<p>In the autumn of Bingyin (1926), when I began working at Wuzhou Pharmacy, I first met Mr. Gao Hanqing, who was in charge of the company's paintings and calligraphy. Mr. Gao, together with the late Mr. Tong Cuifang, was a great publisher in our country, one of the founders of the Commercial Press forty-six years ago.</p>
<p>In the spring of Jishe (1929), upon the order of General Manager Mr. Xiang Songmao, I entered the factory to study. Mr. Xiang invited Mr. Gao to lecture on "The Path to Success for Young People." Mr. Gao encouraged the students with the four words "frugality and diligent practice," displaying the demeanor of a Confucian scholar. At the time, people praised him as the "Yu Pingzhong of today," a title Mr. Gao undoubtedly deserved.</p>
<p>When the Battle of Shanghai broke out, Mr. Xiang died in the line of duty, and the Wuzhou enterprise suddenly fell into a state of leaderlessness. Mr. Gao, who was already in his late sixties and had retired five years prior, was eventually elected by all the shareholders to take on the difficult task of continuing Mr. Xiang's unfinished business. Mr. Gao's work ethic was to "respond to all changes with constancy," directing affairs with composure, day after day for ten years. The fact that Wuzhou's reputation was able to continue and not decline was largely due to Mr. Gao's efforts.</p>
<p>In the mid-autumn of Guiyou (1933), we were delighted to celebrate Mr. Gao's seventieth birthday. My friend Mr. Lin Huzan edited the Wuzhou Monthly and wrote a lengthy interview with Mr. Gao, in which Mr. Gao recounted his life in great detail. Mr. Gao's self-description as being "like a flower in a mirror, the moon in the water, a dream of grandeur" was widely reprinted in Shanghai newspapers and magazines and regarded as a valuable example.</p>
<p>Mr. Gao's old friend, Mr. Yu Heqin, used the words of Xunzi, "May good intentions prolong your life," to congratulate Mr. Gao on his birthday, which fully demonstrated that Mr. Gao's ability to enjoy a long life was due to his own merits.</p>
<p>In the winter of Jiaxu (1934), Wuzhou established a branch store in Guangzhou. I assisted Mr. Fang Qingcheng in managing it. Before my departure, Mr. Gao instructed me, saying: "Lingnan (Guangdong), is indeed a place I have traveled before. On this trip, you should be amazed by its greatness and vastness, humbly seek progress, and never underestimate yourselves. In the past, our country was closed off, and the culture of the Central Plains spread to the south. Since the opening of trade, new knowledge has been imported, mainly from the south. Medicine and hygiene are related to the health of the nation, so it is appropriate to learn from each other's strengths and compensate for weaknesses, aiming to stand on your own. Your responsibilities are great, and the pursuit of profit is secondary." The elder's earnest expectations also reveal his foresight, which is different from that of a petty merchant.</p>
<p>On the Double Ten Festival of Bingzi (1936), Wuzhou's new building was completed. I was summoned back to Shanghai to assist Mr. Gao with administrative work, and I was able to be close to him day and night, like a son to his father. Lamenting my lack of education in my youth, I sought ways to self-study in my spare time. Mr. Gao always provided me with classical books and patiently explained them to me in detail, just like a strict teacher instructing his students.</p>
<p>Mr. Gao was a devout Christian and remained steadfast in his faith throughout his life. Every weekend, he invited Pastor Xin Sheng to the Songmao Memorial Hall to preach to his colleagues, awakening people's consciousness in this turbulent world. I once accompanied Mr. Gao to banquets at the YMCA and the China Christian Educational Association. Mr. Gao said that thirty years ago, he and Xie Honglai, Yu Guozhen, Li Hengchun, Song Yaoru, Wu Tingsheng, Bao Chengchang, Huang Jia, and other comrades jointly founded the Chinese Christian Association, laying the initial foundation for the self-reliance of our country's churches. Mr. Gao's contribution to the fact that Chinese pastors today are completely independent of mission support and subsidies is truly undeniable.</p>
<p>During the Difficult Year of Dingchou (1937), Shanghai was reduced to an isolated island, and the prices of all goods soared, making life difficult for the people. Labor strikes arose one after another, disrupting the entire city. Wuzhou colleagues organized a fellowship association to demand that the authorities improve their treatment, and I was elected as one of the colleagues' representatives, repeatedly negotiating with the authorities. On one occasion, Mr. Gao, sitting in front of the south window, spoke of the suffering of the world and suddenly burst into tears. The representatives were all moved to tears and ultimately decided to resolve the matter according to Mr. Gao's words. Mr. Gao quoted Wang Anshi's words to warn the crowd: "If the virtuous cannot find their way, the wicked will have their way; if the righteous cannot perform rituals, the powerful will behave rudely." The words of the benevolent can be said to speak out against injustice on behalf of the weak.</p>
<p>Later, I left Wuzhou to accept a position at Nanyang Pharmacy. After fifteen years of serving as a guest, the separation was sudden, and I could not help but feel sad. In recent years, Mr. Gao has moved to the YMCA dormitory, following the principle of concealing his talents and not interfering in external affairs. Whenever I visited him, Mr. Gao always expressed words of comfort and concern, which were deeply moving. On June 20th, we respectfully celebrated Mr. Gao's eightieth birthday. Mr. Gao, compassionate and concerned about the world, declined the celebration and instead donated 10,000 yuan from his savings to help the victims of the disaster in North China. It can be said that he who prolongs the life of others is in fact prolonging his own life. Judging from Mr. Gao's good health and appetite, we can anticipate his reaching the age of great longevity and immeasurable blessings.</p>
