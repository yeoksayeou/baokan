<h3 id="c1">重慶之命運（下）——重慶國民黨分裂之必然性 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>結論——大東亞戰爭之進步性</p>
<p>中共利用國民黨的期間，國民黨則只有向中國的資產階級民主革命的方向前進。只在這種範圍內，中共利用國民黨，也許有人說，這對於促使中國走向近代化的一點上說，也未必不是一椿好事。中國資產階級民主革命的主要對象，並非單純反對封建殘餘，同時也反對帝國主義。因為在中國完全握有軍事及政治力量的帝國主義，就是保存中國全部上層建築軍閥官僚這類封建殘餘的力量。所以如不驅逐帝國主義出中國，則不能肅淸中國內部的封建殘餘。只耍國民黨和異族帝國主義作鬥爭時，中共則加以利用，而當國民黨停止和異族作鬥爭時，中共則把它丟掉，這還不是應當的麼？這乍看起來，的確是振振有詞。然而國民黨應當高興被中共利用麼？這正如螳螂，雄者一面交尾，而一面高興被雌者吃掉。這樣雄螳螂的國民黨，當完成所課與的歷史任務後，就應當被中共吃掉麽？我們現在不能不回答這一點。</p>
<p>無論是國民黨，也無論是中國共產黨，諸位都是否曾考慮過：完成世界史現階段上的中國一個國家之資產階級民主革命，究竟是什麼意思？不待言，墨西哥是經過資產階級民主革命的一個國家。假設對於墨西哥發生或多或少的疑問的話，那末，好，我們暫且不談，但總該承認南美的ABC國家，即阿根廷（Argentina），巴西（Brazil），智利（Chile）等，是經過資產階級民主革命的國家吧！這些國家的確有民主式的議會，有近代化的產業，在農業上實行着資木主義的經營。在表面上看，眞是三個堂哉皇哉的「獨立自主」國家。然而這三個國家，現在是用「獨立自主」的主權來決定自己的政策麼？當然用不着申說，誰都會曉得，這些國家的一舉一動，都是唯華雨街的命令是從。（關於阿根廷，雖然不能和其他二者說是半斤與八兩的關係，但現在該國能多少有一點自由空氣者，這不過是該國民族資本家尙能利用華爾街代理人和唐奪街代理人間不一致的微妙關係而巳）。</p>
<p>如果說，中國民主革命的目標，是在於成為第二個墨西哥，第二個巴西，那末，當然無話可說。凡經濟落後的亞洲各國，縱然能完成資產階級民主革命，但如認為那樣就可以擺脫英美資本主義的世界統制，那終不免對於時代有認識不足之嫌。因此，關於抗戰中國的宣傳部所大吹大擂的戰後「世界四大强國」這句話，還有一談的必要。關於銑鐵的每年產量，美國為三千一百五十二萬七千噸，英國為九百四十一萬三千噸（包括印度），蘇聯為一千四百三十九萬五千噸（以上全是根據一九三六年度的統計），而中國幾乎沒有一個可對人言的銑鐵產額數字，諸如此類的不大雅觀之數字，眞是不勝枚舉。總之，銅鑛產額，馬達（Mortor）使用量等，凡近代工業所必要的物資，一切都和英美蘇三國不成比例的中國，有什麽根據，可以自稱是「世界四大强國」呢？（轉入第四版）</p>

<p>南京二十五日中央社電　中·日同盟條約締結及大束亞共同宜言之發表，中·日兩國關係更趨入　期躍進之階段，日本駐華大使谷正之，二十五日下午四時特在官邸接見首都新聞界，對各記者所提問題逐一答復，各報社記者到十餘人，岸情報部長墍淸水，松平兩書記官亦均出席，茲錄谷大使答記者問如下：</p>
<p>政策重點</p>
<p>問，中·日盟約簽訂後，復有大東亞共同宣言之發表，敢問貴國對華政策之開展，以與盟約與宣言為契機，其重點何在？答，大東亞共同宣言之發表及中·日同盟條約之締結，此兩事形式雖屬不同，但精神却一貫，蓋日本之理想，在大東亞各國各得其所，各自完成自主獨立，密切聯絡互相協力，謀本國之繁榮，故日本對華政策首要目的即在協助中國完成自主獨立，而與束亞各國相互密切協力，謀大東亞共榮圈之建設，大東亞政策之開展，即日本對華新施策之起端。自開始以來，巳逐步進展，最近如兩國同盟條約締結，以迄於大東亞共同宣言之發表，即為日本對華新施策進展之政策，至如何建設大東亞共榮圈，在大東亞宣言中巳有明白說明，其目的即在大東亞各國家自主獨立，各得其所，相互協力，密切合作，共謀大東亞之繁榮，如文化方面，則尊重各國傳統之觀念，故各國應謀大束亞文化之發展，此次大東亞宣言之內容，完全與西洋之功利主義不同，如宣言中關於撤廢人種差別一點，其主旨即係東亞各國協力合作，建殷大東亞共榮圈，進而普及於全世界，故吾人綜觀宜言之實質，中·日兩國關係不僅恢復本來面目，此後更應進一步繫密協力，共謀大東亞之建設。</p>
<p>全面和平</p>
<p>問，中·日應如何協力，　通盟約之實踐及戰爭之完遂，進而達到全面和平之早日實現，答，大東亞共榮圈之建設，重要者實為中·日兩國，故兩國今後之重要目標，即以共同努力建設大東亞共榮同為主要使命，以期確保東亞和平及世界和平，至如何實踐盟約之精神，予認為中，日兩國官民應先瞭解盟約及大東亞宣言之眞諦，而後共同覺悟相互理解，則盟約必能實踐，宣言必能執行，進而並能達到完遂戰爭之目的。抑以中·日兩國為大東亞之樞紐，如兩國能領導東亞各國努力奮鬥，吾人深信不但可達到完遂戰爭建設大東亞之目的，並可進而促成全面和平之早日實現。希望中國國民以理智頭腦及自主獨立立塲加以判斷。如認為參加大東亞戰爭為光明大這，則應即　起，努力大東亞共榮建設，完成中國統一，則全面和平之實現指日可待。</p>
<p>兩國靑年</p>
<p>問，大使最近由本國返任，能否將貴國最近情况見告一二？答，本人上次返國，目睹日本國內一般國民情况，頗多感想，蓋日本國民對大東亞戰爭之目的，意義，使命，均有澈底之瞭解成，認為戰爭之勝利，為建設大東亞之關鍵，尤其一般靑年男女，均瞭解大東亞戰爭之意義，故一般靑年學子成願棄學投軍，志切報國，而貴族階級之名門閨媛，尤多捨棄裏華之享樂生活，而努力於艱苦之戰塲工作，其効忠國家之赤忠與精神，誠使吾人感佩之至。總之，日本一億國民，巳堅定必勝不敗之決心與信念，此次返國，使余最惑動者，即在此，最後予對中國靑年，亦寄予莫大之熱望與期待。中．日雨國靑年，應相互理解，緊密合作共同建設大東亞，進而領導全世界，努力確保世界永久和平。</p>
<h3 id="c3">鮑斯返昭南巴莫抵仰光 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>昭南二十五日中央社電　江特拉鮑斯前於東京列席大東亞會議後，曾赴華訪問，南返途中又往菲列賓及西貢等地，茲巳於今日下午返抵此間。</p>
<p>仰光二十五日中央社電　出席大東亞會議之緬甸代表巴莫，於返國途次，曾道經馬尼刺北婆羅州，巳於昨日傍晚抵此。</p>
<p>西貫十二五日中央社電　江特拉鮑斯，廿四日來西貢，今晨九時半離此他往。行前接見記者團，發表談話稱：基於大東亞會議，亞洲十俄民衆之前途愈益光明，而本人對今後所當採取之態度，亦得有堅決之自信。故歸國途中，特在南京對渝方廣播，想渝方對余之言論，亦當無任何非議也。印度在中日事變當時，亦曾有一部缺乏認識抱有誤解者同情渝方，但大束亞戰爭勃發後，渝軍與英勾結侵入印度，印度完全被人出賣，於是印度民衆對日感情一變，尤其自日本扶持緬菲等獨立，承認印度臨時政府後，更認淸印度不得日本支援不能獨立，故印度對日態度，遂由尊敬轉為信賴。刻英美方面雖對我臨時政府之成立，彷彿漠不關心，但我臨時政府對印度民衆，則有莫大影響。余有日本之支援，曁在外印僑之擁議，決將祖國之印人自英美桎梏中解放，余對進軍印度事，抱有充分之力量與準備。</p>

<p>馬尼剌二十五日中央社電，菲律賓獨立後，其第一屆國會，二十五日十時開會，阿基諾議長首宣吿開會，因出席議員已足法定人數，議會遂吿成立，乃將此報吿大總統洛勒爾，大總統即偕全體閣　於十時十五分到會，旋即開始施政演說，洛勒爾首先報告大東亞會議之經過，逐條宣讀大東亞宣言，且予解說後，復言及日本邁進大東亞戰爭之決意及努力，謂無日本之勝利，即無大東亞共榮圈，亦無菲律賓之獨立。最後乃提出以下數案，要求議會通過，計　增加食糧及生活必需物資生產案，　增加藥類生產案，　確保治安案，　改着運輸方法案，　增稅及確保新財源以及設立中央銀行案，　改廢合併行政機構及設立經濟部案，　擴充救濟事業案等。</p>

<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>此次因出席大束亞新聞大會之便，赴日觀光，自十一月十一日啓程，二十五日返滬，凡十四日，在東京勾留十二日，除參加會議外，與日本朝野人士頗多接觸，略誌觀感如次：</p>
<p>大東亞新聞大會，舉行於大東亞會議發表共同宣言以後，能以共同宣言為基點，討論如何發揮新聞力量，喚起大東亞十億民族澈底瞭解其精義所在。俾團結一致，爭取共同勝利。這次會議，就時間上言，最為消切的。</p>
<p>大會凡三日，圓滿閉幕。會塲佈置之嚴密，會外招待之週到，誠有賓至如歸之概。這是應向日本新聞會賭先生特別表示感謝的。</p>
<p>不過，就個人感想，大會也不無缺點。討論的範圍，並未包含新聞事業的技術問題。比如菲律賓過去受美國麻醉已久，緬甸受英國毒素很深，思想上影響頗大。中國的新聞事業雖巳有數十年歷史，究諸內客，仍極幼稚，無論在設備，技術與人村培養方面都極落後，凡此種種實際情形，如不設法先予調整，對於宣揚大東亞共同宣言的精義，在效率上自不能期望太高。所以，我們一方面固然要克盡新聞事業的使命，品揚大東亞理想；然而，一方面就不得不充實新聞事業的力量，使能肩荷此重任。這是大東亞各國新聞從業者，於瞭解使命以外，尤須注意於實際的技術進步之一點。</p>
<p>在日本都市，社會安定，一如平日，似乎看不出戰時現象，可是，這與我們國內都市的看不出戰時現象，截然不同的。而日本朝野人民的內心，却是一致的充滿着戰時情緒，以保衛國家與解放大東亞為埋頭奮鬥的目標。這些絕不是抽象的說法，隨處可有事實佐證。最值得感動的。是最近日本××萬大學靑年的服兵役，齊赴前錢。我們承認他們是為保衛祖國，可是，也不能否認他們更為解放大東亞。在鐵路各車站常常看到同學歡送出發，悄緒之熱烈，令人興激昂慷慨之感。日本實年頗服膺「忠」與「孝」，慷慨從戎，是為忠；赴前錢之前，一定辭拜祖墳，是盡孝。某晚，我應改造社山本社長招宴，並舉行懇談，是日，恰巧他的大公子要同鹿兒為家鄉，拜辭祖墳，準備入伍。此種情景，在中國人的家庭裏，或許因兒女情長，依依憎別。但是山本夫婦，殷勤招呼，絕無惜別之意，而以子弟送給國家，服務戰役，引為愉快。其次，靑年服兵役，絕無階級之分或企圖逃避，如西園寺公之孫，於十一月十二日入伍，即女子服勞役亦然，雖東條首相之兩女公子，亦與平民女子同樣義務服役。</p>
<p>日本朝野對於中國問題之關心，極為普邇而熱切，宴會聚談，輒以中國眞相相詢。使我最感慚愧而無法答覆者有二點：其一，中國在參戰以後，朝野戰時情緒之熱烈如何？其二，自從日本實踐對華新政策以後，中國和平區內人民，對於日本的親密如何？</p>
<p>日本朝野對於中國，的確有眞誠好意的表現，我們中國人民自從事變以後，不免懷有成見，對於日本朝野的好意，一時未能瞭解，朱盡信任，因此，我們要求兩國朝野的親密，必先放棄成見，辨別善惡，善者自善，惡者自惡，不因成見而善者亦以為惡，方為兩國前途之福。據我所知的兩件事，實為之感動。其一，東京市有日人七里先生者，為中國留學生義務服務巳達二十五年之久，諸如指導學業，協助解決困難問題，完全發於自動之眞誠，絕未接受中國使館津貼，或受日本政府委託。其二，京都地方有中　先生者，辦理學生宿舍一所　雇有女管事一位，專為中國學生服務，她最近同鄕送兒子往前棧去後，仍囘京都，繼續為中國學生服務。這種事例很多，雖似瑣細，但眞心誠意的表現　自也不能熟視無睹的。</p>
<p>日本國內物價低廉，如與我國比較，誠令人呆住。日本在中日事變前之物價與今日比較，約漲百分之五十。衣料價約漲百分之三十。近二年來日常用品均採配給制度，物價並無變化。如以簡單家庭為例，每月收入約為一百七十元，則支出方面，夫婦兩人（中上生活）生活費用八十元，公債貯金三十五元，尙有餘款五十五元。公務員及工人之收入，均在二百元以上。於此可見生活安定之一斑。</p>
<p>日本社會機構嚴密，統制適當，配給合理，一般生活，平均平等，有錢者雖欲享受，亦難非分取得。應吃糧米大家吃。應吃肉時也大家吃，平民如此，首相大臣亦然；貧者如此，富者亦然。節衣縮食，普遍實踐，非無物資，而是節約物資以實獻於完遂戰爭上。</p>
<p>總之，「人盡其材，物盡其用」，在日本國內的確巳充分做到。那末，「取人之長，補我之短」，實為我們全體同胞應從速猛醒，急起直追的。</p>

<p>中央社訊　日大東亞省山本次官，為視察中日新條約締結後之華中新情勢起見，於二十四日偕同堂脇中國事務局總務課長，藤原調査官抵滬，上午訪問日陸海軍各部隊及陸海軍醫院，下午赴大使館事務所，總領事館，分別致訓，五時招待記者團，發表感想，略謂：關於全面和平，頗為人所注目，然日本決非僅為顧慮眼前事態，而希望獲致全面和平，由大東亞新事態及日本所採取之公正坦道而觀，深信必可促進中國之統一。印度自由政府主席鮑斯氏之向重慶廣播，實亦具有此種意義，同為東亞人，對於東亞之解決，決無人願意加以拒絕，此種事實，觀於日前大東亞會議舉行當時各代表之滿腔熱忱，即可證明。大東亞會議決非僅為日本之宜傳，乃為東亞人精誠之團結，越南在東亞之地位，頗為奧妙，然目前越南之指導階級，均巳覺悟，非與日本合作，無以圖存。同時南洋華僑在戰前亦多失策，然目前均巳一致覺醒，誓願協力建設大東亞。滿洲國之躍進，當與日本一心一德協力之結果，實為一良好榜樣。由目前事態而觀，或有人以為滿洲國之政策，似有變更，實非正確，蓋目前滿洲國之建設國策，與十年前不獨亳無更動，且為適應新事態起見，益將擴充强化，實現日滿一體化云。</p>

<p>菲律賓獨立以後，即積極推進國內諸般產業經濟政策；日昨菲農商部長曾就生活必需物資之增產對策一點答復中央社記者，其所說明之各項計劃中第一為食糧增奮五年計劃，第二為一般農業，水產業。林業，畜牧業等之增產，並擬擴充及整飭製造業，家庭手工業之合理增產，第三為解決推進此等政策基礎之價格問題及增設農事試騐塲，並擬增產生活必需物資，俾違成菲律賓經濟自給之目的。概括言之，這便是菲律賓正在積極推進中的產業經濟政策。</p>
<p>以增加生產為中心對集的「戰時經濟政策綱鎭」，就是我國的產業經濟政策。我們感覺在釐訂與實施各項計劃中，藉資進應國內的環境，殊有取法於菲律賓之必要，因為菲律賓猶如中國，也是一個幾業國家，所以於其推行產業經濟政策之中，不得不特別注重於農業增產，其次則及家庭手工業，又其次，則為機製品之增產，蓋所以適應國內之現實環境，其步驟固當如此。我們感覺在農工生產並重之呼聲下，為求避免r捨本逐末」的一個生產趨勢，實當由國家從速製訂大規模的鼓勵慶業生產計劃，作為戰時經濟政策中心對象之中心。最近各方協力推進產村貸款工作，而本市大量游資投入農林畜牧事業者，兩月中將達一萬萬元，自為產業經濟界的一片佳音，因為。如何使食糧增產？如何使棉植增產？如何使戰時人民的衣食都不至於發生問題？實為今日最迫切，最重要，最值得研究討論，以至於付諸實施的問題。</p>

<h3 id="c63">代論　（自第一版轉來） <a href="#c63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>凡眞正關懷中國命運的人們，決不以這樣「夢想」而趾高氣揚的吧！站在中國的立塲上說，不，站在亞洲各民族的立塲上說，當前最重大的問題，乃是首先製造繁榮亞洲的物質基礎。這就是說，先從英美的血手裹奪回繫榮亞洲的物質基礎。如辦不到這一點，縱然費盡腦汁所爭取的「資產階級民主」，也終不免是空中樓閣的幻想。亞洲各民族，雖然建立各自所好的政體，是自己的事；但亞洲各民族相互屠殺，以繁榮亞洲的共同物質基礎，委諸英美之手，則為不可饒恕的亞洲叛徒。現在的時代，如不把亞洲組成一個「大地域」國家羣，則決不可能對抗英美那樣「大地域」國家羣。（蘇聯單獨一國之所以繁榮，就是因為它本身是一個版圖廣大的國家）。在目前這一個時代，亞洲各國各自高唱「獨立自主」，而不關懷亞洲全體的命遵，則亞洲將永渝為半殖民地的水深火熱裏，不得翻身。在目前這一個時代，中國當前迫切的課題，並不僅是「完成資產階級民主革命」，而是如何獻身地完成亞洲「大地域」國家羣。關於這一點，中國人對於大東亞戰爭進步性的觀察角度，應當有所改變。中國共產黨站在自己的立塲上，曾和帝國主義者死拚二十二年了；國民黨自從民國肇始以來，也和帝國主義者肉搏三十二年了。然而單純以他們自巳的武力，能够像日本軍隊在二年大東亞戰爭內，驅逐英美那樣，把英美驅逐出亞洲麽？諸位無論在口頭上怎樣主張，但諸位在內心裏却很清楚地知道，大家都沒有一九四一年轟炸威爾斯親王號戰艦的武器和技術。有了日本的武力，才能奪回繁榮亞洲的物質基礎。於是便有了觀察大東亞戰爭進步性的一個角度。諸位無論在口頭上怎樣主張，然而諸位在內心裏却在想念，如沒有大東亞戰爭，一九四三年菲律賓和緬甸的獨立是不可能的。或許諸位對於這個問題，要有所聲辯。諸位也許要說，日本所給與菲律賓和緬甸的獨立，只是形式上的獨立。好，我們退一萬步來假定諸位所說的「形式上的獨立」，是正確的。然而諸位不能不承認，就是「形式上的獨立」，也有促成實質上的獨立之事實。諸位都知道，民國元年的中國政府，會是「形式上的民主政府」，但却不能不承認這個形式上的民主政府，總比滿淸專制政府，促進了中國的民主主義强得多了。</p>
<p>回想中日事變，在一九三七年至一九四三年的過程當中，不能說本質上，沒有發生大的變化。尤其是以一九四一年十二月八日為轉捩點，曾發生了根本的變化。大東亞戰爭的進步性，就是基礎於當時所爆發的世界局面之變化上。中國的命運，實在是決定於中國為政者是否能把握得住這一大東亞戰爭本質的變化，以及是否能適應這一變化。假如國民黨不能理解這一點，則重慶的當前問題即如下：</p>
<p>現在的世界形勢，在訊速地使中國抗戰陣營內的國共兩黨勢力關係變化着。現在中共在各地的政治活動上，甚至對國民黨開始攻勢了。假如蘇聯在默洲取得勝利，那末中共的勢力就成為金城湯池之固了。</p>
<p>與此同時，由於對共產黨之恐懼，逐漸在國民黨的內部擴大着，而反共和平派的勢力也愈益成長着。他們與中共閒的鬥爭，雖然業已公開，但其傾向，今後將愈益露骨，那時蔣介石也就不可能再保持過去那樣對這一鬥爭的超然態度了。</p>
<p>最後結局，國民黨將實行分裂，一部跑到日本去，一部則與中國共產黨駢肩繼續抗戰，——即將分成道兩個陣營。然而與中國共產黨駢肩繼續作戰者，那時則不能不服從中共的抗戰領導權。（這種現象，在國共衝突最嚴重的地帶上，業巳實現了）。</p>
<p>上述便是迫近決定的重慶「最後之命運」。然而，重慶的命運無論在那種情形下，當然都不能說，是反日戰爭的「最後勝利」。（季譯）（全文完）</p>

<p>嚴酷的冬天已降臨了。各人的身上都一層層的厚起來了。這時，母親對於自己孩子的飲食起居當然比平常時候更關心，可是，有些做母親的因為太關心了而甚至害了她們的孩子，以下幾點是冬天主婦們所應特別注意的：</p>
<p>有許多主婦們在冬天都將煤爐放在房中，這樣一方面可以取暖，一方面又便利。但，這是極不好的舉動，因為冬天的門窗都不十分開，已經使空氣變得很混濁，如果再放一隻煤爐在房中，那是更有些烟霧騰騰了。雖然不至有中煤毒的危險，可是對於孩子們的腦神經是有相當害處的。</p>
<p>令孩子們不要蒙被和穿了很厚的衣服睡覺。我們應該知道蒙被睡覺是形成感冒的最大原因，而穿了厚衣服睡覺是養成畏縮習慣的主要原素。</p>
<p>做母親的怕孩子們冷，所以在每餐的時候呌孩子吃得飽飽的，但孩子却不知叫他們吃飽些是為了禦寒，他們照樣跑跳，這樣冷倒沒有防，大病却巳上身了。（程起鵬）</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Fate of Chongqing (Continued) - The Inevitability of the Kuomintang's Split in Chongqing <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Toyosuke Yoshida</p>
<p>Conclusion – The Progressiveness of the Greater East Asia War</p>
<p>During the period when the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) utilized the Kuomintang (KMT), the KMT only moved in the direction of a bourgeois democratic revolution in China. Perhaps some would say that, within this scope, the CCP's use of the KMT wasn't necessarily a bad thing, as it promoted China's modernization to some extent. The main targets of China's bourgeois democratic revolution were not only the remnants of feudalism but also imperialism. Because imperialism, with its complete military and political power in China, preserved the power of feudal remnants like warlord bureaucrats within China's entire superstructure. Therefore, if imperialism wasn't expelled from China, the remnants of feudalism within China couldn't be completely eliminated. Isn't it right for the CCP to utilize the KMT when it fights against foreign imperialism, and to discard it when it stops fighting against foreign powers? This seems logical at first glance. However, should the KMT be happy to be used by the CCP? It's like a praying mantis, where the male is happy to be eaten by the female during mating. Should the KMT, like a male praying mantis, be eaten by the CCP after completing its assigned historical mission? We must now answer this point.</p>
<p>Whether it's the KMT or the CCP, have you ever considered what it really means for China, as a nation, to complete its bourgeois democratic revolution at this current stage of world history? Needless to say, Mexico is a country that has undergone a bourgeois democratic revolution. If there are doubts about Mexico, then let's not talk about it for now. But surely we can acknowledge that the ABC countries of South America, namely Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, are countries that have undergone bourgeois democratic revolutions! These countries indeed have democratic parliaments, modernized industries, and capitalist management in agriculture. On the surface, they appear to be three grand and imposing "independent and autonomous" nations. However, do these three countries now use their "independent and autonomous" sovereignty to determine their own policies? Of course, it goes without saying that everyone knows that these countries act solely on the orders of Wall Street. (Regarding Argentina, although it cannot be said to be exactly the same as the other two, the fact that the country has a little freedom now is merely because its national capitalists are able to exploit the subtle inconsistencies between Wall Street agents and Threadneedle Street agents.)</p>
<p>If the goal of China's democratic revolution is to become a second Mexico or a second Brazil, then, of course, there's nothing more to say. Even if economically backward Asian countries can complete bourgeois democratic revolutions, believing that they can escape the global domination of Anglo-American capitalism is ultimately a sign of insufficient understanding of the times. Therefore, there's a need to discuss the post-war "Four Great Powers" that the Anti-Japanese War propaganda department boasted about. Regarding the annual production of pig iron, the United States produces 31,527,000 tons, the United Kingdom produces 9,413,000 tons (including India), and the Soviet Union produces 14,395,000 tons (all based on 1936 statistics). China has almost no decent figure to speak of for pig iron production. Unflattering figures like these are too numerous to list. In short, with copper ore production, motor usage, and all materials necessary for modern industry being disproportionately small compared to the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, on what basis can China claim to be one of the "Four Great Powers"?

<h3 id="e2">Ambassador Tani Discusses Close Cooperation Between China and Japan for the Construction of Greater East Asia in a Press Conference in Nanjing <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) – With the conclusion of the China-Japan Alliance Treaty and the publication of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, relations between China and Japan are moving towards a stage of great progress. Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani Masazane, held a press conference at his official residence at 4 PM on the 25th to answer questions from the capital's press corps. More than a dozen reporters from various newspapers attended. Director of Intelligence Kishi, and Secretaries Shimizu and Matsudaira were also present. The following is a record of Ambassador Tani's answers to the reporters' questions:</p>
<p>Policy Focus</p>
<p>Question: Following the signing of the China-Japan Alliance Treaty and the publication of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, may I ask what the focus of your country's policy development towards China will be, taking the treaty and declaration as a starting point? Answer: The publication of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration and the conclusion of the China-Japan Alliance Treaty, while different in form, are consistent in spirit. Japan's ideal is that each country in Greater East Asia finds its place, achieves its own independence and autonomy, and closely cooperates to seek the prosperity of its own country. Therefore, the primary objective of Japan's policy towards China is to assist China in achieving its own independence and autonomy, and to closely cooperate with other East Asian countries to construct the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The development of the Greater East Asia policy is the beginning of Japan's new measures towards China. Since its inception, it has been steadily progressing. Recently, the conclusion of the two countries' alliance treaty, as well as the publication of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, represent the progress of Japan's policy towards China. The Greater East Asia Declaration clearly explains how to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Its purpose is to ensure that each country in Greater East Asia is independent and autonomous, finds its place, cooperates closely, and jointly seeks the prosperity of Greater East Asia. In terms of culture, we respect the traditional concepts of each country. Therefore, each country should seek the development of Greater East Asian culture. The content of this Greater East Asia Declaration is completely different from Western utilitarianism. For example, the point about abolishing racial discrimination in the declaration's main purpose is to have each East Asian country cooperate to build a prosperous Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, which will then be extended to the whole world. Therefore, looking at the substance of the declaration, the relationship between China and Japan will not only restore its original form but will also further strengthen close cooperation to jointly build Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Peace</p>
<p>Question: How should China and Japan cooperate to implement the alliance treaty and complete the war, in order to achieve a comprehensive peace as soon as possible? Answer: The construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is of great importance to both China and Japan. Therefore, the important goal for both countries in the future is to jointly strive to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere as the main mission, in order to ensure peace in East Asia and world peace. As for how to implement the spirit of the alliance treaty, I believe that the officials and people of China and Japan should first understand the true meaning of the alliance treaty and the Greater East Asia Declaration, and then jointly awaken and understand each other, then the alliance treaty will surely be implemented, the declaration will surely be executed, and the goal of completing the war will be achieved. Since China and Japan are the pivot of Greater East Asia, if the two countries can lead the East Asian countries to strive hard, we firmly believe that not only can we achieve the goal of completing the war and building Greater East Asia, but we can also further promote the early realization of comprehensive peace. I hope that the Chinese people will make a rational judgment based on an independent and autonomous position. If they believe that participating in the Greater East Asia War is the bright road, then they should rise up and strive for the construction of Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity, and complete the unification of China, then the realization of comprehensive peace will be just around the corner.</p>
<p>Youth of Both Countries</p>
<p>Question: Your Excellency recently returned from your country to your post, could you tell us something about the recent situation in your country? Answer: When I returned to my country last time, I witnessed the situation of the general public in Japan, and I had many thoughts. The Japanese people have a thorough understanding of the purpose, meaning, and mission of the Greater East Asia War, and believe that victory in the war is the key to building Greater East Asia. In particular, the general youth understand the meaning of the Greater East Asia War, so the general young students are willing to drop out of school to join the army, and are eager to serve the country, and the noble ladies of the aristocracy, even more give up the enjoyment of luxury life, and work hard in the difficult war, their loyalty to the country and spirit, is really admirable. In short, 100 million Japanese people have firmly determined the determination and belief of certain victory and invincibility, this return to the country, which makes me the most confused, is this, finally, I to the Chinese youth, also places the enormous warmth expectation and anticipation. The youth of China and Japan should understand each other, cooperate closely, jointly build Greater East Asia, and then lead the world, and strive to ensure lasting world peace.</p>

<p>Syonan, 25th (Central News Agency) – Subhas Chandra Bose, after attending the Greater East Asia Conference in Tokyo, visited China and then returned south, stopping in the Philippines and Saigon. He arrived here this afternoon.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 25th (Central News Agency) – Burmese representative Ba Maw, who attended the Greater East Asia Conference, passed through Manila and North Borneo on his way back to his country, and arrived here yesterday evening.</p>
<p>Saigon, 25th (Central News Agency) – Subhas Chandra Bose arrived in Saigon on the 24th and left for other destinations at 9:30 this morning. Before leaving, he met with a group of reporters and stated that, based on the Greater East Asia Conference, the future of the people of ten Russian nations in Asia is becoming brighter, and that he has gained firm confidence in the attitude he should take in the future. Therefore, on the way home, he broadcast to Chongqing in Nanjing, and he believes that Chongqing will not have any criticism of his remarks. At the time of the Sino-Japanese Incident, some people in India, lacking understanding and harboring misunderstandings, sympathized with Chongqing, but after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Chongqing army colluded with the British and invaded India, and India was completely betrayed. As a result, the Indian people's feelings towards Japan changed, especially since Japan supported the independence of Burma, the Philippines, etc., and recognized the Provisional Government of India, it became clear that India could not be independent without Japanese support, so India's attitude towards Japan changed from respect to trust. Although the British and Americans seem indifferent to the establishment of our Provisional Government, our Provisional Government has a great influence on the Indian people. With the support of Japan and the support of overseas Indian nationals, I am determined to liberate the people of India from the shackles of the British and Americans. I have full strength and preparation for advancing into India.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) – The Greater East Asia War is approaching its second anniversary.

<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) – Since the US military landed on Mono Island on October 27, until the fifth Bougainville sea and air battle on November 17, the damage it has suffered has been gradually announced by the Imperial Headquarters. However, because the US authorities are concealing the damage suffered in these battles, Information Officer Iguchi of the Japanese Information Bureau previously criticized the deceptive means of the US authorities at a meeting with the foreign press corps, and pointed out at a meeting with the foreign press corps on the 22nd that the enemy's losses were at least 24,000 personnel, and the construction cost of the sunken warships totaled 630 million yuan. Generally speaking, the loss rate of those who were sunk immediately is 80% to 100%, while the loss rate of those who sank later is 30% to 40%. The wounded are also about 10%.

After considerable progress has been achieved, the issuance of new Allied Reserve Bank notes will be discontinued in this region. Subsequently, in line with administrative progress, a full-scale exchange with Central Reserve Bank notes will be implemented. From December 1, all taxes and fees for public services such as railways in this region may be paid with Central Reserve Bank notes, and the use of Central Reserve Bank notes will be encouraged to gradually strengthen the joint use measures. The prices of various goods will also be marked in both currencies. At the same time, travelers traveling south from this area will be allowed to carry Central Reserve Bank notes from this area out of the territory within a certain limit. Furthermore, travelers arriving from the south may bring 1,000 yuan per person without having to exchange it at the station, which is extremely convenient for travelers. The aforementioned rate of 100 Central Reserve Bank notes to 18 Allied Reserve Bank notes applies to all occasions where joint use is in effect, and the authorities will seek to ensure foolproof measures for its implementation. There will also be unlimited exchange for the two currencies, as needed. As for the joint use by merchants and civilians in this region, it will not hinder transactions. Furthermore, when the joint use measures are first implemented in this region, no measures will be taken to convert Allied Reserve Bank notes into Central Reserve Bank notes for the time being. Except as mentioned above, the currency exchange system for travelers between North and Central China will remain as it is. In addition, the methods of material acquisition by material acquisition organizations in this region and the regulations for exporting materials to Central and North China will not be changed. The main points of these measures are roughly as described above. The authorities are extremely cautious regarding policies for the economic development and promotion of trade in this region. Allied authorities are also deeply assisting with these measures. It is hoped that merchants and civilians will fully understand the authorities' intentions and assist in the completion of these measures.</p>

<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) German Minister of Propaganda Goebbels and Capital Garrison Commander Gorlitz delivered short speeches to the residents of the German capital yesterday, saying that the German people's determination to win cannot be shaken by air raids. Goebbels commented that the recent British terror bombing only attempted to destroy residential areas and cultural buildings, but could not damage the slightest of Germany's war production. The enemy is using despicable means to achieve its goals that it cannot succeed on the battlefield, namely, to make the German resistance force diminish. It is a fallacy for the enemy to think that the spirit of the people of the German capital is weaker than that of other cities. Although the people and their residences have been damaged, the difficulties of the German people will disappear. He expressed special thanks for the trained spirit of the Germans in the air raids and believed that the Germans would all fulfill their responsibilities and a new, more beautiful Berlin would be reborn after victory.</p>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a Reuters dispatch: It is learned here that the British planes lost 52 bombers and approximately 400 pilots in two night raids on Berlin. This is the number of enemy aircraft shot down. The number of aircraft damaged by gunfire on the way home has not yet been included. British planes, disregarding the infamous name of barbaric warfare, are air raiding Berlin, showing that Britain has repeatedly suffered setbacks in the military field and has to make up for it with air raids. German officials say: If the enemy wants to use air raids to demoralize the German people, then the people of Berlin will also show the tenacious spirit of other German cities that have suffered air raids.</p>

<h3 id="e30">Impressions of a Trip to the East — Wishing to Sincerely Advise My Fellow Countrymen — <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>This time, taking advantage of attending the Greater East Asia News Conference, I went to Japan for sightseeing. I departed on November 11th and returned to Shanghai on the 25th, a total of fourteen days. I stayed in Tokyo for twelve days. Besides attending the conference, I had quite a bit of contact with people from various sectors of Japanese society. I will briefly record my impressions as follows:</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia News Conference was held after the Greater East Asia Conference issued a joint declaration. It could use the joint declaration as a foundation to discuss how to leverage the power of news to awaken the ten hundred million people of Greater East Asia to thoroughly understand its essence, so that they can unite and strive for common victory. This conference was most urgent in terms of timing.</p>
<p>The conference lasted for three days and concluded successfully. The meticulous arrangement of the venue and the attentive hospitality outside the venue truly gave the feeling of being at home. Special thanks should be expressed to Mr. [Name] of the Japan Newspaper Association.</p>
<p>However, from a personal perspective, the conference was not without its shortcomings. The scope of discussion did not include the technical problems of the news industry. For example, the Philippines has been anesthetized by the United States for a long time, and Myanmar has been deeply poisoned by the United Kingdom, resulting in a great impact on their thinking. Although China's news industry has several decades of history, its content is still extremely immature. Whether in terms of equipment, technology, or talent cultivation, it is very backward. If these kinds of practical situations are not addressed and adjusted first, the efficiency of promoting the essence of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration cannot be expected to be too high. Therefore, on the one hand, we must do our utmost to fulfill the mission of the news industry and promote the ideals of Greater East Asia; on the other hand, we must strengthen the power of the news industry so that it can shoulder this important task. This is something that news practitioners in various countries of Greater East Asia, in addition to understanding their mission, must pay particular attention to: actual technological progress.</p>
<p>In Japanese cities, society is stable and normal, and one hardly sees wartime phenomena. However, this is completely different from the lack of wartime phenomena in our domestic cities. The people of Japan, from the government to the common people, are consistently filled with wartime emotions, with the goal of protecting the country and liberating Greater East Asia as the focus of their efforts. These are by no means abstract statements, and there is evidence everywhere to support them. What is most moving is the recent conscription of tens of thousands of university students in Japan, who are going to the front lines. We acknowledge that they are doing so to protect their motherland, but we cannot deny that they are also doing so to liberate Greater East Asia. At railway stations, one often sees classmates sending off those departing, and the enthusiasm of the sentiments is inspiring. The Japanese truly revere "loyalty" and "filial piety." Generously enlisting in the army is loyalty; paying respects to ancestral graves before going to the front lines is fulfilling filial piety. One evening, I was invited to a banquet by Mr. Yamamoto, the president of Kaizo-sha, and a discussion was held. On that day, his eldest son happened to be returning to his hometown of Kagoshima to pay respects to the ancestral graves in preparation for joining the army. In Chinese families, perhaps due to parental love, there would be reluctance and affectionate farewells. However, Mr. and Mrs. Yamamoto extended their hospitality and showed no reluctance, but rather took pleasure in sending their son to the nation to serve in the war. Furthermore, there is no distinction of class or attempts to evade military service among young people who enlist. For example, the grandson of Prince Saionji enlisted on November 12th. The same is true for women performing labor service. Even the two daughters of Prime Minister Tojo perform the same obligatory service as ordinary women.</p>
<p>The Japanese government and people are extremely widespread and enthusiastic in their concern for the China issue. At banquets and discussions, they always inquire about the true situation in China. What I find most embarrassing and unable to answer are two points: first, how enthusiastic are the wartime emotions of the government and people of China after joining the war? Second, since Japan implemented its new policy toward China, how close are the people in the peaceful areas of China to Japan?</p>
<p>The Japanese government and people do indeed show sincere goodwill toward China. Since the incident, our Chinese people inevitably harbor prejudices and have not been able to understand or fully trust the goodwill of the Japanese government and people. Therefore, if we want the governments and people of the two countries to be close, we must first abandon prejudices, distinguish between good and evil, recognize good as good, and recognize evil as evil, and not consider good as evil because of prejudice. This is the blessing for the future of both countries. Two things I know have truly moved me. First, there is a Mr. Shichiri in Tokyo who has been providing voluntary service to Chinese students for twenty-five years, such as guiding their studies and helping them solve difficult problems. This is completely based on his own sincerity and he has never accepted subsidies from the Chinese embassy or been entrusted by the Japanese government. Second, there is a Mr. Zhong [Name] in Kyoto who runs a student dormitory and employs a female caretaker who is dedicated to serving Chinese students. After sending her son to the front lines recently, she returned to Kyoto to continue serving Chinese students. There are many such examples. Although they seem trivial, the expression of sincerity and good intentions cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Domestic prices in Japan are low, which is astonishing compared to our country. Compared to the prices before the Sino-Japanese War, prices in Japan today have risen by about 50%. Clothing prices have risen by about 30%. In the past two years, daily necessities have been subject to a rationing system, and prices have not changed. For example, for a simple family, the monthly income is about 170 yuan, then the expenditure would be 80 yuan for living expenses for the couple (middle to upper class), 35 yuan for government bond savings, and there would be a surplus of 55 yuan. The income of civil servants and workers is over 200 yuan. From this, one can see a glimpse of the stability of life.</p>
<p>Japan's social institutions are strict, the control is appropriate, the rationing is reasonable, and the general life is average and equal. Even if the rich want to enjoy themselves, it is difficult to obtain more than their fair share. Everyone eats rice when they should eat rice. Everyone eats meat when they should eat meat. The common people are like this, and so are the prime minister and ministers; the poor are like this, and so are the rich. Saving on clothing and food is universally practiced. It is not that there are no materials, but that materials are saved to dedicate them to the completion of the war.</p>
<p>In short, "everyone uses their talents to the fullest, and everything is used to its fullest" has indeed been fully achieved in Japan. Therefore, "take the strengths of others to make up for our weaknesses" is something that all of our compatriots should quickly awaken to and strive to catch up with.</p>

<h3 id="e31">The Rice Rationing Association's Procurement Is Quite Smooth; Large Quantities of Rice Will Be Shipped to Shanghai to Help the People's Food Supply <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Since the Rice Rationing Committee took charge of the unified purchase and distribution of rice, it has been actively engaged in organizing lower-level institutions. Preparatory committees of procurement associations in various regions and offices in various regions have been established one after another. According to the association, considering that the people's food supply is a major issue, in order to achieve good success in the procurement work, it focused on the selection of excellent rice merchants at the beginning of its establishment, in order to maximize the efficiency of the unified purchase and distribution mechanism. At the same time, the Japanese side also actively assisted in this, so the promotion of the procurement work was very smooth. It is reported that the rice collected by procurement merchants in various regions of the association has reached a considerable amount and will soon be shipped to Shanghai in large quantities to help the people's food supply.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Vice Minister Yamamoto Inspects the New Situation in Central China; Arrives in Shanghai and Expresses Impressions to the Press Corps <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Vice Minister Yamamoto of the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry, in order to inspect the new situation in Central China after the conclusion of the new Sino-Japanese treaty, arrived in Shanghai on the 24th, accompanied by Mr. Dowa, the chief of the General Affairs Section of the China Affairs Bureau, and Investigator Fujiwara. In the morning, he visited the various units of the Japanese Army and Navy and the Army and Navy hospitals. In the afternoon, he went to the embassy office and the consulate general to give instructions. At 5 o'clock, he received the press corps and expressed his impressions, saying: "The overall peace is quite noteworthy, but Japan is by no means merely considering the current situation and hoping to achieve overall peace. From the new situation in Greater East Asia and the fair and honest path taken by Japan, I firmly believe that it will promote the unification of China. The broadcast to Chongqing by Chairman Bose of the Free India government also has this meaning. As fellow East Asians, no one is willing to refuse the solution of East Asia. This fact can be proven by the enthusiasm of the representatives at the Greater East Asia Conference held the other day. The Greater East Asia Conference is by no means merely a propaganda for Japan, but a sincere unity of East Asians. Vietnam's position in East Asia is quite subtle, but the current leaders of Vietnam are all aware that there is no way to survive without cooperating with Japan. At the same time, many overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia made mistakes before the war, but now they are all awakened and vowed to cooperate in building Greater East Asia. The leap forward of Manchuria should be the result of the cooperation between Japan and Manchuria with one heart and one mind, which is a good example. From the current situation, some people may think that the policies of Manchuria seem to have changed, which is not correct. The national construction policy of Manchuria is not only not changed from ten years ago, but also expanded and strengthened to adapt to the new situation and realize the integration of Japan and Manchuria."</p>

<p>After the Oil and Grain Professional Committee unified the purchase of edible oil raw materials and allocated them to various oil mills for centralized distribution, the distribution of household oil in Shanghai has been transferred from the Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office to the committee. A reporter from the Shanghai Social Work Association learned from relevant sources yesterday that, in order to strengthen the edible oil distribution mechanism, the Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office has been changed to the "Shanghai District Edible Oil Industry Joint Trust Office," which has a distribution department to handle household oil distribution matters. The distribution system will be improved, and the past system of receiving oil with household registration certificates will be abolished and changed to a coupon-based system, similar to the allocation of rice, flour, sugar, matches, and soap by population. It is reported that the first and second coupons of the oil purchase certificate for the 1st and 8th districts have been issued to the residents within the jurisdiction by the former Public Works Department (1st district) and the Public Works Bureau (8th district). Certificate holders are requested to keep them safe and not lose them, so as not to give up their right to edible oil distribution.

<h3 id="e44">Reporting Minister Matsushima Criticizes the US for Covering Up Defeat as Victory; Fabricating News to Conceal the Situation <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency: After the US suffered a series of disastrous defeats in the Bougainville Island and Gilbert Islands areas, the severity of the damage can be seen from the announcements of the Japanese General Headquarters and the urgent convening of emergency meetings by the US leaders to seek remedies. However, the US authorities are deeply afraid that the truth will cause public unrest once it is published, so they have always tried to conceal the extent of the damage, or even fabricate favorable news to divert attention. Mr. Matsushima, the reporting minister of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, when meeting with the press corps on the 24th, specifically criticized this point, saying: "The announcement made by US Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz is extremely contradictory and ridiculous. He claimed that there were no Japanese fleets in the vicinity of Bougainville and the Gilbert Islands, which was the result of the complete destruction of the Japanese fleet by the Laffey Air Battle. This statement is extremely naive and laughable. It must be known that the fleet battle on which the fate of the country depends is by no means comparable to a child's fight, and there is no reason to show people an opportunity lightly. The operations of the Japanese Navy are majestic and special, which cannot be followed by them. Nimitz also claimed that the US Air Force is very excellent, but the only problem is that the number of aircraft and materials is too small. This proves that the damage to US aircraft is significant. He also claimed that in order to carry out longer-range operations, the number of fleets is too small. From this, it can also be proved that the damage to its fleet is significant. The extravagant words he boasted before the Battle of Mona Island are like a world away from his confession today three weeks later. However, the American newspaper reporters were able to express satisfaction with this announcement, and their understanding of naval tactics is truly blind."</p>

<h3 id="e59">Commentary: Industrial Economic Policy <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Since the independence of the Philippines, it has actively promoted various domestic industrial and economic policies. Recently, the Philippine Minister of Agriculture and Commerce answered questions from a Central News Agency reporter regarding countermeasures to increase the production of essential living materials. Among the plans he explained, the first is a five-year plan to increase food production, the second is to increase the production of general agriculture, fisheries, forestry, animal husbandry, etc., and plans to expand and rectify the rational increase in manufacturing and domestic handicrafts. The third is to solve the price problem that is the basis for promoting these policies and to increase the number of agricultural experiment stations, and plans to increase the production of essential living materials, so as to achieve the goal of Philippine economic self-sufficiency. In general, this is the industrial and economic policy that the Philippines is actively promoting.</p>
<p>The "Wartime Economic Policy Outline" centered on increasing production is our country's industrial and economic policy. We feel that in formulating and implementing various plans, it is necessary to learn from the Philippines to adapt to the domestic environment. Because the Philippines, like China, is also an agricultural country, so in the implementation of its industrial and economic policies, it is necessary to pay special attention to agricultural production, followed by domestic handicrafts, and then the increase in manufactured goods, which is to adapt to the domestic reality, and the steps should be so. We feel that under the call for equal emphasis on agricultural and industrial production, in order to avoid a production trend of "abandoning the fundamental and pursuing the trivial," the country should promptly formulate a large-scale plan to encourage agricultural production as the central target of the wartime economic policy. Recently, all parties have cooperated to promote rural loan work, and a large amount of floating capital in this city has been invested in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, which will reach 10 million yuan in two months, which is a good sign for the industrial and economic circles. Because how to increase food production? How to increase cotton production? How to ensure that the people's food, clothing, and shelter during the war will not be a problem? This is the most urgent, most important, and most worthy of research and discussion today, and even to be put into practice.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Alternative Argument (Transferred from the First Page) <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Those who truly care about the fate of China will never be arrogant because of such "dreams"! From the standpoint of China, no, from the standpoint of the Asian nations, the most important issue at present is to first create the material basis for the prosperity of Asia. That is to say, first seize back the material basis for the prosperity of Asia from the bloody hands of Britain and the United States. If this cannot be done, even if we exhaust our brains to fight for "bourgeois democracy," it will inevitably be a fantasy in the air. Although it is the business of the Asian nations to establish their own preferred political systems, it is unforgivable Asian traitors for the Asian nations to kill each other, and to entrust the common material basis for the prosperity of Asia to the hands of Britain and the United States. In the present era, if Asia is not organized into a "large regional" group of countries, it will never be possible to confront "large regional" groups of countries like Britain and the United States. (The reason why the Soviet Union is prosperous alone is because it is itself a country with a vast territory). In the present era, if Asian countries each sing the praises of "independence and autonomy" without caring about the fate of the entire Asia, then Asia will forever be in the abyss of semi-colonialism and will not be able to turn over. In the present era, the urgent task of China is not only to "complete the bourgeois democratic revolution," but how to dedicate itself to completing the Asian "large regional" group of countries. Regarding this point, the Chinese people's perspective on observing the progressiveness of the Greater East Asia War should be changed. The Chinese Communist Party, standing on its own position, has fought to the death with the imperialists for twenty-two years; the Kuomintang, since the beginning of the Republic of China, has also fought with the imperialists for thirty-two years. However, can they, with their own military force alone, drive Britain and the United States out of Asia like the Japanese army drove out Britain and the United States in the two years of the Greater East Asia War? No matter how you advocate verbally, you know very clearly in your heart that you do not have the weapons and technology to bomb the Prince of Wales battleship in 1941. With the military force of Japan, we can seize back the material basis for the prosperity of Asia. Thus, there is an angle to observe the progressiveness of the Greater East Asia War. No matter how you advocate verbally, you are thinking in your heart that without the Greater East Asia War, the independence of the Philippines and Myanmar in 1943 would be impossible. Perhaps you have some arguments about this issue. You may say that the independence that Japan gave to the Philippines and Myanmar is only formal independence. Okay, let's take a step back and assume that what you said about "formal independence" is correct. However, you cannot but admit that even "formal independence" has the fact of promoting substantive independence. You all know that the Chinese government in the first year of the Republic of China was a "formal democratic government," but you cannot but admit that this formal democratic government promoted Chinese democracy much more than the Manchu Qing autocratic government.</p>
<p>Looking back at the Sino-Japanese Incident, we cannot say that there were no major changes in essence during the process from 1937 to 1943. Especially with December 8, 1941 as the turning point, a fundamental change occurred. The progressiveness of the Greater East Asia War is based on the changes in the world situation that broke out at that time. The fate of China is really determined by whether the Chinese rulers can grasp the essential changes in this Greater East Asia War and whether they can adapt to these changes. If the Kuomintang cannot understand this point, then the current problem in Chongqing is as follows:</p>
<p>The current world situation is rapidly changing the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in the Chinese anti-Japanese war camp. Now the CCP has even begun an offensive against the Kuomintang in its political activities in various places. If the Soviet Union wins in Manchuria, then the CCP's power will be as solid as a rock.</p>
<p>At the same time, due to the fear of the Communist Party, it is gradually expanding within the Kuomintang, and the power of the anti-Communist peace faction is also growing. Although their struggle with the CCP has already been made public, its tendency will become more and more blatant in the future. At that time, Chiang Kai-shek will no longer be able to maintain the same detached attitude towards this struggle as in the past.</p>
<p>In the end, the Kuomintang will split, one part will run to Japan, and the other part will continue to fight the anti-Japanese war shoulder to shoulder with the Chinese Communist Party, that is, it will be divided into two camps. However, those who continue to fight shoulder to shoulder with the Chinese Communist Party will have to obey the CCP's leadership in the anti-Japanese war at that time. (This phenomenon has already been realized in the areas where the Kuomintang-Communist conflict is the most serious).</p>
<p>The above is the "final fate" of Chongqing that is approaching decision. However, under any circumstances, Chongqing's fate cannot be said to be the "final victory" of the anti-Japanese war. (Translated by Ji) (End of full text)</p>

<h3 id="e64">Winter Household Hygiene Tips <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Harsh winter has arrived. Everyone is wearing layers and layers of thick clothes. At this time, mothers are naturally more concerned about their children's diet and daily life than usual, but some mothers even harm their children because they are too concerned. The following are a few points that housewives should pay special attention to in winter:</p>
<p>Many housewives put coal stoves in the room in winter, which is convenient for both heating and convenience. However, this is a very bad move, because the doors and windows in winter are not very open, which has already made the air very turbid. If you put a coal stove in the room again, it will be even more smoky. Although there is no risk of coal poisoning, it is quite harmful to children's brain nerves.</p>
<p>Do not let children sleep with their heads covered and wear very thick clothes. We should know that sleeping with your head covered is the biggest cause of colds, and wearing thick clothes to sleep is the main element in developing a timid habit.</p>
<p>Mothers are afraid that their children will be cold, so they call them to eat their fill at every meal, but the children do not know that they are asked to eat their fill in order to keep out the cold. They still run and jump as usual, so they do not prevent the cold, but a serious illness has already taken hold. (Cheng Qipeng)</p>
