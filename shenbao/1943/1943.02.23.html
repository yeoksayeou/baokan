<p>社評</p>
<h3>在論全面現價及實施辦法</h3>
<p>一咋論及「加強統制物價問題」之後，深覺問題的重大性，尚有加以申論的必要。我們始終認爲目前的物價問題，不是局部或一地的問題，因此不能由局部的或某一地區加以解決，而必須謀水全面的對策。所以，我們一方面贊同以本市及其他各大城市的物價統制爲模範而首先實施，但另方面則認定還必須儘速展開全面的統制與限價。</p>
<p>所謂全面限價的主要內容：第一，應該規定各省市縣對於所轄區域內重要市塲的物價運價和工資，一雜定期實施合理的限價，而不僅以食糧·食油·燃料·糖鹽·花紗·布疋·紙張等人民生活必須品爲限價的對象。因爲物價也如有機體，牽一髮而全身動，不僅原料價格和製成品價格，供給價格和市塲價格間的關係，非常密切，而相輔物。品相競物品或競用生產原素物品的價格，彼此間也常互相影響，即廠價·躉售價·零售價又復互相聯繫。所以，若限價只及於某特定的幾種，而對其餘物價放任自由發展，則特定的幾種仍不免受到其他物價上漲的牽連。所以限價的範圍，必須包括全部。第二，限價還須普及於各地重要市塲。因爲仟何市塲上物價的變動，都足以影響整個限價法令的執行，所以，即使是窮鄉僻壤，也不能忽視其市塲性而加以管制。貨物一定是隨物價高下而流動，若僅選擇若干重要城市爲管制的據點，而放任其餘市集於不管，則檢查雖嚴，而貨物之逃避，仍必不免，城市的鄉村間的貨物不能作適當與必要的交換，限價政策也就不能貫澈了。</p>
<p>如果實行全面統制，全面限價，則情形就完全不同了。因爲全面限價實施之後，勞工將不致因生活費的增加，而要求提高工資，人民的貨幣所得，雖因加稅和儲蓄等而减少，然其實際所得，將不致如現在的因物價上漲而縮减，且其儲蓄也可獲得保障，不致因物價高漲而貶值。廠商的物價，雖經限制，定其成本，可因保證而固定。若物價繼續飛漲，則貨幣利益雖大，而以實物計算的資產實已减少。這種情形，相信廠商方面了解得很淸楚的，所以，全面限價，實爲維護戰時經濟社會秩序的先決條件。而且，全面限價，還有助於稀少物品的公平分配。假使不實行全面限價，則若干稀少物品將爲特殊有勢者及有錢者所獨占。還有若干供給不足的生活必需品，欲使實現各取所需，可不依其出價能力的大小以爲分配，則也全靠全面限價之切實施行。</p>
<p>然而全面限價，並不是輕而易舉的事，在實施過程中，一般工商業者不免受到一些損失或遭遇多少不便，因此，阻力是不能倖免的。同時，若干自私自利之徒，利用時機與其他關係，操縱·囤積·逃避·居奇·不售·擾亂市塲，多方破壞，種種不良現象也會隨之發生。爲此，在實施中，當局有不能不雷勵風行，嚴予取締。在各地管制機關力量不足時，除由上級管制機關扶助外，並應組織經濟檢查隊，協助管制機關，嚴行取締囤積·逃避與黑市交易，檢舉一般不法行爲，並獎　人民檢舉，由人民機關監督限價的實行。這種政治上力量的運用，在機構組織上未臻周全，管制技術還欠妥善之時，自然不容易充分發揮其效能。所以，一方面執行中必須絕對遵依法律，對於拘捕罰款等，允須絕對依據法律，以使工商界心悅誠服，避免引起市塲混亂，蕭條與社會驚疑之外，同時還有賴於經濟力量的輔助，各物資機關應準備多量的物資供應市塲，經過相當時期的調整，管制漸趨嚴密，市塲交易恢復正常狀態後，此項措施可以逐漸减少，人心也可因限價的實行漸趨安定，利潤有限制，望風上漲之風减殺，則限價政策也可以顺利推進了。</p>
<p>在全面限價政策實施之時，尚須加强管制市塲物資的產購運銷，疏導各地物資，調劑市塲供需，以實施限價政策能持久實行。但是先決條件，必須各種物資管制能够配合限價政策普遍於各地區實施。在現狀下，中央及各省市所設置的各種管制物資機關，或者不能直轄統籌，也需要分工合作，取得密切的聯繫：工作範圍可以劃分，辦法步驟必須一致，以免彼此割裂牽制與衝突，有礙「貨暢其流之原則其决，在目前各種條件不够情况之下，實施全面限價，還必須採用逐步推進的原則；而同時還須注意到各方面許多根本平價措施不易　實增進和不易阻遏物價上漲的現實情形，過分嚴格的實施限價政策，結果不免發生困商病民的流弊。生產者不願多生產，商人也不願努力營運，自私自利之徒更乘　偷漏逃匿，不肯的執行人員，或不免上下其手而毀法營私，這樣，雖可强制限價於一時，殊難期其持久，獲得平價的實效。所以在實施中尚須予各種限價以適當的調整，並隨時考察市塲情形，經過相當時期，繼加調整，這種調整步驟，如果是一般限價物品，必須各地區配合一致，調整的時期不能太短。在未調整限價以前，如果重要的貨品成本確實超過限價，或毫無利潤者，可經當地管制機關的核准，予以單獨的調整，以鼓勵生產，增進營運。</p>
<p>總之，我們實施限制政策，無當是適應現狀，首先制止物價不合理的的上漲，多方控制，逐步調整，漸進地穩定各地物價，務使限價政策，在初期實行時能夠收到相當的效果，避免不良的反作用，進而澈底實行。只有這樣才能改善人民生活，鞏固社會秩序，而貫徹政府戰時國策。如果徒求速成，拔苗助長，眩於理論，漠視現實，則困商病民，阻礙生產，擾亂市場，未見其利，先受其禍，必非質明之當局所願也。</p>

<h3>美海軍的敗北</h3>
<p>美國海軍為了要死守喀達爾加納頗一島，極力頑抗，但是　戰皆北，去年八日以後，該處的幾次海戰，美方完全失敗。先後被告擊沉沒的艦艇有九十二艘，受傷的有三十八艘，喪失了飛機一千三百十一架。如果再把夏威夷海以還的損害併計在內，美國已經喪失了十分之七的戰艦，航空母艦的損失尤多，巡洋艦也不在少數。美方不情重大犧牲固守喀達爾加納爾，希圖不讓不本有寸尺進步。</p>
<p>去春起，軸心國方面的潛水艇，發揮威力，據德軍司令部最近的發表稱：單是用潛水艇擊沉的敵方艦船，平均每月有二十萬噸，從開戰到現在，總計有三千一百餘萬噸。同時日本的潛水艇，最近也相當活躍，衝進澳洲東岸的美澳兵站綫，從一月中旬至二月上旬爲止，雖然爲時不久，可是已經擊沉了滿載軍火物資的敵方輸送船六艘。</p>
<p>上决曾經有人質問過邱吉爾，關於應付潛水艇的問題，邱吉爾的解釋是，遭潛水艇襲擊的損害，已有漸决减輕的傾向，他這種掩飾是非，縱使屬實，也沒有法子可以沮止袖心潛艇花大西洋上活躍。最近其有力報紙也斥責邱氏的言論，認爲仟憑邱吉爾如何詭辯，終難一手蔽天。英美船舶的被害，超過了他們的新造船舶。英國泰曙士報也曾透露過悲觀論調，自認大西洋上的損害慘重，唯有等待美國海軍的護航，美國報紙也有此說。所以今後美國無論建艦多少，總有一部份要喪失在大西洋，這是情勢使然，無可强求的。再退一步說，就算是建艦成功，補充了過去的一切消耗，足以配備東西兩洋，然而他們已經喪失了二萬有餘飽經訓練的海軍，物力即使無虞，可是這種人力怎能一朝一夕補充呢？它的大破綻不是依然沒有補好嗎？</p>
<p>日海軍在太平洋一戰，不單可以決定太平洋的戰局，而且能在另一方面阻止美海軍進擊歐洲，助長德義潛水艇的活躍，這個貢獻是不小的。</p>
<p>在這裏就發生了東西戰局的連帶關係，祇要互相協力來運用這個速帶關係，我們軸心國的最後勝利，必然成功無疑的了！（雲鵬：譯自二月十五日東京讀賣報知）</p>

<h3>汪主席日前徐　對官民訓話要旨</h3>
<p>（中央社京訊）國民政府在主席於十九日下午一時蒞臨徐州公會堂、對當地機關團體民衆學生及日本居留民訓話、其大要如决、</p>
<p>各位同胞、友邦居留民團各位先生、兄弟此次到徐州、有兩個感想、第一、徐州一帶爲中國歷史名地、漢唐宋明四個統一時代、有二個時代是在這一帶創基立業的、一個是漢高祖、一個是明太粗、徐州一帶人民自昔風俗淳樸、英氣蓬勃、深信各位同胞定能將歷史上傳說的愛國心擴大起來、担負起救國興亞的大任、昨晚沿途看見歡迎的民衆、朝氣煥發、今晨父看見侏安隊及靑少年團活潑勇敢、使我不禁想起這歷史名地的徐州同胞、過去有此風俗、有此英氣、今日仍保存着這風俗這英氣、快慰之情、匪可言宜、第二、五年前中日事變曾在此地發生惡戰、如今想來猶覺痛心、自和平遝動發動以來、我們一本國父大亞洲主義的遺敎、在滿佈荊棘的途程中、邁力前進、期使　去之創痕歸於平復、進而建立善鄰友好的基礎、頃聞郝長官報告、徐州有一萬三千友邦居留民、這一萬三千友邦居留民與我們徐州同胞朝夕相歲、各愛其國、互愛其鄰、共愛東亞、由這種純潔的親愛心、終能使創巨痛深之地、一變而爲融洽祥和之區、這種勇敢的精神、能不令我感佩、</p>
<p>以上所說來徐州的感想、一是千餘年歷史的往蹟、個是近年來具體事實、如今打算就大東亞戰爭的形勢、歐洲　局、中國參戰的意義、及我們應有的努力、扼要的說幾句話、</p>
<p>先說大東亞戰爭之形勢及歐洲戰局、自從友邦發動大東亞戰爭以來、半年之內、席捲南洋、滕利基礎、業已奠定、爲什麽說滕利基礎業已奠定呢、因為此次的作戰、是渡海作戰、友邦由去年所獲得的戰果、睦海空軍滿佈太平洋各根據地、就中以空軍根據地允爲重要、就此次大東亞戰爭及歐洲戰爭所得到的經騐、渡海作戰、先要制空、才能制海、友邦旣已在太平洋上建立了無數的空軍根據地、空軍根據地的威力、絕不是任何航空母艦所可比擬的、在此情勢之下、英美想以渡海作戰、來實行反攻、其困難可想而見、反而言之、去年戰果之確保、及今後戰果之拓展、就是有絕對的把握、大東亞戰爭、前途之光明也就不言而喻了、至於歐洲戰局、無論德蘇戰爭、或德國對英美的戰爭、照軍事專家可靠的計算、（此處有關軍事作戰之說明從略）軸心國家早已處在必勝之優勞、冬季之後、繼之以春季攻勢、勝負之數可計日而待、其前途又是樂觀而光明的、决就中國參戰之意義來說、去年我到東京、東條首相會對我鄭重的說過一句話「東亞有十萬萬人團結起來、　界上仟何集團國家都沒有這樣偉大的力量「、大東亞戰爭勝利的根本在此、大東亞共榮圈建設的根本亦在於此、怎樣才能使十萬萬東亞人團結起來呢、簡單一句話、就是要各愛其國、互愛其鄰、共愛東亞、人人能够將這三種愛的心來打成一片、便能够團結、團結便是力量、中國有四萬萬五千萬人中國是東亞的一部份、對於保衛東亞的戰爭、對於建設東亞的大業、有應盡的義務、有應有的權利、這便是中國參戰最大的意義、</p>
<p>最後說到參戰後應有之努力、今年元旦我曾提出三個工作的重點、普及新國民運動的精神和訓練、以此精神、以此訓練、協力大東亞戰爭、一是確立治安、一是增加生產、這三種工作、本來已是很重要的、參戰後更爲重要、關於這三點我平日已說過很多話、如今只補充幾句、今晨我看見靑少年團的團旗、遵照新國民遝動促進委員會的規定、中間是靑天白日滿地紅的國徽國、徽之下團結着三枝箭、這是很有意義的、從前有一段故事、一矢易折、衆矢難摧、一個父親臨終時候、叫三個兒子各給一箭、一折便斷了、敎他們合在一起、便折不斷、這就是說一個人無論有多少能力、各自爲謀是無用的、團結才有力量、三枝箭涵義甚多、而團結最爲重要、所以用三象徵中日滿三個兄弟之邦、所以用箭表示勇猛精進、刻苦耐勞之精神、我們令日爲興復中華保衛東亞、就中國言是言之、要團結四萬萬五千萬中國同胞、就東亞言之、要團結十萬萬東亞同胞、團結是復興的基礎、是決戰必勝的基礎、也就是共存共榮的基礎、至於靑天白日滿地紅國旗是國父首倡革命時所決定、當乙未年第一次首義的時候、因爲首義計劃爲淸廷所偵知、未能大舉、革命同志不得已退出廣州、陸皓東同志爲保護此旗不使落於敵人之手、復返城中、遂致殉難、國父想及陸先烈的犧牲、從此更堅決以此旗爲　立民國的國旗、靑天白日意義明顯不必說、滿地紅即漢代之紅旗、又爲陸皓東及革命諸先烈之鮮血所染成、靑少年團團旗以國徽團結三箭、允具有深長之意義、總而言之、新國民運動第一要每一個人業於中國及東亞之前途有明確之認識、對於大東亞戰爭之必勝有堅定之信念、尤其要使每一個人都在嚴格的訓練、嚴密的組織之中、得到團結的精神、說到確立治安、不　是要靠保安隊、同時也要靠民衆協力、蘇淮地區治安逐步確立盼望更進一步以民衆的協力、謀民衆的自衛、如此地方治安、才能做到全部的確立、至於增加生產和　的消費、有密切關係、須知道在戰爭時期沒有一國不是在困苦中搘拄的、不但交戰國如此、中立國也如此、不但戰敗國如此、戰勝國也如此、怎樣才能在困苦中搘拄的、一方面固然要增加生產、一方面又要節的消費、去年十一月二十一日我到日本、在飛機上看見束京一座座的工廠、烟突直聳雲霄、烟霧蔽天、足見友邦在戰爭中不斷的前進、工業不斷的增加生產、</p>
<p>到了東京訪問東條首相的時候、却知道首相官邸內還不生火、只首相室內略具一點、一方面黑烟蔽犬大量的用煤、以盡　生產、一方面連首都官邸在冬季嚴寒也不生火、以盡力節的、兩相對照、眞令人感慨無量、　此可見我們今日不只是要增加生產、並且要節的消費、使有用之物力、無一些無謂的消耗、一點一滴、都用之於有效的增產、必這樣節的消費才有意義、必這樣增加生產　有成就、以上三點是今年工作的重點、尤其是參戰後我們應加倍努力之所在、雖然這三點是我當常說的、但旣然是今日工作的重要、我無論到什麼地方、也不能不爲同胞們反覆說明、共相策勵、以徐州同胞淳樸的風俗、勇敢的英氣、我確信徐州同胞定能够做得到、不僅徐州同胞、整個蘇淮特區的同胞也做得到、全國同胞爲着救中國、保東亞、也一定都做得到的、中國的命運怎樣、東亞的命運怎樣、全靠我們今後的努力、中國的命運與東亞的命運不可分、中國獨立自由才能分担東亞的責任、而中國獨立自由之獲得、有待於東亞之解放、大東亞戰爭勝利之後、也卽是中國獨立自由之時、盼望各位同胞抱定勇猛精進刻苦耐勞的精神、團結全國同胞、團結束亞民族、努力前進、以爭取大東亞戰爭之勝利、東亞前途是光明的，世界前途是光明的、中國前途是光明的、</p>

<h3>印度人士　奮鬥精神　日寄以深切同情　崛情報部長談話</h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電　日崛報情報局第三部長今日就因甘地翁之悲壯絕食　爭所引起之印度危局、對記者團　表談話如次、甘地翁現狀頗為危險、因翁之健康問題、印度仍頗有發生騷動可能、翁以偉大毅力忍受肉體之痛苦、現仍爲印度之獨立而繼續其崇高雄壯之鬥爭、印度四億民衆在此悲壯之塲面前、亦已提出即時釋放聖雄甘地及實現印度獨立與自由之要求、然英政府對此僅以冷然處之、仍不改其蔑視與蹂躪印度民衆之故態、但吾人對於英政府此種態度毫不驚奇、蓋思及前次大戰後英當局對付印度之故事、其理甚明、當前次大戰時、英政府曾有許可印度獨立之誓約、然大戰結束後、英政府不但未履行其與印度之誓約、且更頒布較前尤奇之路拉特法權、以壓制印度民衆之正當言論、而所謂阿姆利則慘案、尤爲印度壓迫史上不能滌除之血腥一頁、然英　對此則坦然處之、其於甘地翁之生死與印度國民之神聖要求、毫不加以考慮、反之、我日本帝國之對印態度、東條首相於一月二十八日議會之演說中、已加闡明、印度民衆臨此重大危機、對我方之態度應有深切之認識與信賴、東條首相曾云、帝國爲新印度之建設、除對其國內國外含辛茹苦之印度指導階級及民衆、寄與最大之同情外、並期待其偉大事業迅速成功、如此帝國決不吝予以全面之協力云、親諸我國之方針、吾人對於刻下印度情勢之轉移、現正以最大之同情與理解而注視其演化、且確僧印度民衆必獲得　後之勝利、聚雄甘她在英帝國主義之桎梏下、或終不免於絕命、且更將有其他多數之印度領袖犧牲於英國之壓迫下、亦未可知、但吾人確信印度四億民衆獲取獨立之精神、無論遭　　　　迷之英國政府如何彈壓、亦絕不　　　云、</p>
<h3>澳門通訉　桂林市裏的奢華者　揮金如土氣概萬千</h3>
<p>今年的桂林，似乎特別景氣，千數百元一瓶的白蘭地，三數百元一聽的香烟，據說也頗有人購爲禮品。大家說，桂林變成「小上海」或「小香港」了：　我們細看這社會的底層，有多少家庭在焦愁？高物價平常便把許多人壓得喘不了氣，這幾天肉類蔬菜無一不漲價，債主臨門，子女啼泣的正不知凡幾。</p>
<p>今年因爲物價飛躍騰漲，許多公務員及薪水階級的生活更苦，中國因爲物產豐富，最低限度，吃的問題，還沒有歐洲各國那麽嚴重問題是苦樂太不公平。尤其是那些發國難財的，揮金如土，氣概萬千，他們不僅造成了物價的上漲，而且也擾亂了地方的秩序，冲淡了社會緊張的情緒。王船山曾謂，「賈人者，汚吏所亟進而寵之者也；汚吏非賈人，無以供其不急之求；假之以顏色而聽其輝煌，復何忌哉。賈人之富也，貧人以自富者也。牟利易，則用財也輕；志小而不知裁，智昏而不恤其安，欺貧懦以矜夸，而國安得不貧」。這正是今日後方的寫照。</p>
<p>漢高祖定天下，第一道命令，　嚴禁賈人衣錦綺，操兵乘馬。因爲他對於楚漢相爭時那些「發國難財」的商人，實在深惡痛絕到極點了。所以嚴定這精神制裁的辦法。現在我們對於這些投機商人，自然不能用這種嚴厲的辦法來制裁，而且已有許多商人，盡了本位的責職，他們和投機商人間很難有顯明辨別的辦法；假使一體制裁，那決非事理之平。但在積極方面，對於善良商人，尊重表揚，使他們精神上獲得相當安慰，却也千該萬該。但究竟社會對於他們表示了多少尊敬？「祗認衣衫不認人」的陋習，依然很普遍；而一般說來，今日　社會上高視闊步的，還是那些投機發國難財的商人這種不平現象，實　應該痛加改革。（三十一年十二月二十日寄）</p>

<h3>廣播協會成立二週年　林理事長廣播詞</h3>
<p>南京二界二日中央社電　昨（二十二）日爲中國廣播事業協會成立二周年紀念日、該會理事長林柏生氏、特於二十二日晚八時至八時二十分、在中央廣播演講、茲錄原詞如下、</p>
<p>今天是中國廣播事業建設協會成立二周年紀念、兩年以來、賴政府當局之指導、友邦關係方面之協助、以及全國聽衆之共同愛護、本會同人之一致奮勉、使中國廣播事業於極短的時期之中、得以確立了基礎、同時也在這個時期之中、我們適應着國內外情勢的發展、使廣播事業對於國民政府整個國策之推進、對於大東亞戰爭之宣傳報道、與東亞共榮圈之建設、均有其本位之貢獻、把文化事業與政治宣傳打成一片、使文化工作者對於國家民族盡其應盡的責任、這本來是全體主義的國家文化政策之路綫、而中國廣播事業之建設、於兩年以來、也充分的證明我們正在這一條途徑上共同努力、</p>
<p>回顧本會成立之初正値國民政還都以後的一年、東亞聯盟運動繼中日基本條約與中日滿共同宣言積極展開的時候、前年今天、本會正式成立於南京、同時在南京設立中央電臺、在上海漢口、杭州蘇州、寗波、相繼設立電臺、我們遵循中央已定國策、加強宣傳的機構、隨着大時代的洪流勇往邁進、</p>
<p>從國內來說、我們對於國民政府的淸鄉工作、經濟的復興建設奧新國民運動、從國際上說、我們從友邦首先發動的大東亞戰爭、一直到本年一月國府之總力參戰、我們都鄭重的視爲整個工作的重點、曾經以最大的努力、於本位工作有極高度的發　、這都是可以拿兩年以來的事實加以覆按的、</p>
<p>關於本會過去和今後工作方針、於此有幾點必須提出和全國聽衆共同商討的、</p>
<p>第一、廣播事業在今天已經不是一種個人娛樂的工具了、它實在是一種傳播思想、溝通民情、補助敎育、引導生活的文化宣傳機構、尤其在戰火瀰漫的現在、沒有一個國家不把思想鬥爭的使命加之於廣播事業的身上、自從本年一月九日國府參戰以後、我們已經和英美等國家正式人於戰爭狀態、因此我們必須更進一步的强化我們的廣播事業、以實行總力參戰、同生共死的誓言、關於這一點、光是靠本會的單獨努力是不够的、必須和全國聽衆緊密的携手、我們在今天誠意的期待全國的聽衆、給我們更大的協助、第二、中國廣播事業發達較遲過去的廣播電台政府方面也缺乏合理化的管理、大都任其自由發展、以商業方式來經營、本會成立以後、竭力矯正這種傾向、一方面糾正管理的電台、一方面取締違禁的收音機、我們知道現在各國對於短波無綫電、都是禁止使用的、這本來是戰時的必要處置、我們於國家參戰以後、即着手與軍警當局聯絡、取締違禁的收音機、以肅淸英美侵略者在思想文化上的殘餘勢力、在積極方面我們更努力於無綫電收音之普及工作、雖然物資的短少、在今天已成爲普遍的現象、但是對於一般人民所最適用的收音機、我們竭力加緊的製作、務使全國同胞能普遍得到接收這種精神　糧的機會、</p>
<p>第三、關於廣播節目方面、我們爲適應戰時的需要、提高人民智識水準、對於一切頽廢的享樂的娛樂節目、要儘量的减少、而於嚴肅的灌輸戰時必需要的敎育播音之中、對於正當的遊藝節目、加以適當的調和、以增加聽衆對於廣播的興趣、而引導生活之向上、總之、我們在廣播事業的範圍以內、是應該充分做到同甘共苦這句口號、我們爲打倒英美侵略者及其鷹犬、必須與友邦日本及東西的軸心國家共同携手、號召全國同胞袪除個人自由主義者享樂的心理、刻苦耐勞勇猛精進、本會同人自當竭其棉力、共同策勵、在廣播實施上、我們決定在本年以內、完成强力電波、計劃使中國廣播事業在東亞在國際成爲有力的一環、加緊思想鬥爭、完成建設新中國、建設新東亞的使命</p>
<h3>如何煮食糙米</h3>
<p>— 美代子夫人日記</p>
<p>鑒於時局的艱難，日本一億國民，都以糙米為國民食糧。東條首相全家首先實踐以糙米為食糧，作為後方民衆的榜樣。首相的長孫正城（三歲）—首相子輝雄氏長男—初因輝雄氏夫人美代子母乳不足，消化及營養皆不良，疾病綿延，體氣虛弱。自食糙米後，據相川大政翼贊會實踐局長的鑑定書，發育極爲壯强。正城之强壯的發育，皆由於去年二月以來食糙米後，美代子細心照拂所致。茲介紹夫人的實踐日記如次：</p>
<p>二月</p>
<p>正城出生後，已經八個月了。誕生的時候，母乳即感不足，至第五個月時，即同時　以母乳及牛乳。自第六月起，因飲量增多，全部用牛乳替代。但因牛乳與體質不適，開始下痢，迄今已有三月。體氣衰弱，發育不良，精神不振。舅氏東條首相）至爲担心，來信試以糙米煮食。此時適當斷乳期，得舅氏的獎勵之力，開始餵食糙米。　　　　　　　　　始，費許多工夫，參考種種如何食糙米的書籍，先將糙米浸入水中一夜，用磨研碎，和以牛乳一滿杯用文火調成糊狀，約煮二十分鐘即成。我們擔心或許因消化不良而有黑色的糙米殼從大便　流出，但却沒有，自開始食糙米乳以來，二三日間，頑周的下痢　恍然若失，大便正常。向二木謙三博士訊問時，稱糙米效爲有效的　　，並無妨害，於是遂覺安心。</p>
<p>五月</p>
<p>食糙米乳已有三月，並無不適，大便良好。最近血色轉佳，回憶三個月前蒼白的面色時，恨不及早餵以糙米乳。因爲體軀發肥，精神活潑，於是於本月起從糙米乳進一步至糙米粥。仔細觀察最初二三日的狀况，似極喜食，並無妨害腸胃的現象，實際上可說已完全斷乳。最初，用煮白米粥的方法，一度失敗，比白米大概須多加六倍的水。俟水沸騰，加糙米待其煮開，即從火上取下置於一　，特其彭眼，再用文火炊燉，頃刻即成粥狀。用煮二次的方法實行時至爲容易。正城的腸胃，自此愈趨正常，日見肥碩。</p>
<p>八月</p>
<p>因正城的狀態，有了自信，於是　家遂實行以糙米爲食。與煮粥同樣也須炊二次，最初以爲若炊二次，手續旣繁，時間亦長，消耗燃料或許很多。但習慣後比炊白米飯更爲容易。晚膳準備完畢後，利用空閒的火力先炊一次，至翌晨再加强火稍悶即成，燃料旣經濟，又可節省朝晨忙碌的時間，大有助於我等伺候主人之從早出勤。水的加减，約以二倍爲標準，米若多時，可用更簡易的方法。水的加减，與白米不同，不必仔細考慮。水若過多，可於炊煮的中途减少，　　　少，可於中途加注，絕對不會炊僵。舅氏曾有信來，說他們（首相夫婦）業巳自六月起開始食糙米，情形良好。我所患的討厭的便秘，也治好了。丈夫也很喜食糙米說：在咀嚼時有甘味。</p>
<p>十月</p>
<p>正城前因患病不能食飯，自上月起，也與我們同食糙米飯了。忙碌的丈夫，每至夏季即食欲减退，面容消瘦，今年則旣不疲倦，也不瘦弱了。我也克服了　夏症，往年夏天被困於不眠症，今年則睡得很好。這都出於食糙米之賜。女備本不慣於車舟，有暈車暈舟之苦，此次歸里，乘坐車船來回於知多半島並無暈眩的感覺因以大喜。前幾日至東京時，舅氏誇讚說：「正城的血色很好，　　　　　　　　　」</p>
<p>十一月</p>
<p>已屆樹木皆枯，寒冷的季節了。去年今日，正城，我夫婦，時感風邪，醫藥不絕，現在則失眠症霍然而愈，大家都酣睡至天明。結果，調整胃腸，營養良好，也不再喜食脂肪成分多的副食物。正城則體氣充沛，日見肥壯，比附近同時誕生的孩子們發育更佳。</p>
<p>十二月</p>
<p>食糙米因咀嚼時有甘味，故咀嚼自然成爲習慣。女傭說：「近來食量漸趨减少｛」最近因米的不足而感到困苦，此後不致再發生了。食糙米的直接動機，爲了節米，如此，或許可以早日達到目的。舅氏也都因此而自本月起全家以糙米爲食糧了。（翔：課自二月十　　　　　　　）</p>

<h3>維護校舍問題　望業主能够諒解</h3>
<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>目前上海兩租界的私立學校，正遭遇到一個嚴重問題，就是若干業主，已向法院申請將出租的校舍收回。因此，各個私立學校聯合起來，正在作維護校舍的運動。這問題已鬧得相當久，而到目前爲止，還沒有解决的方法。</p>
<p>在這裏，我們站在敎育的立塲上，希望一般的業主，能够早日諒解，勿再堅持。要知任何私立學校，一旦校舍被收回了，非惟在今日的情形之下，另覓其他的校舍，一時不易，即使覓到，因爲各校的學生，以通學者佔居多數，如果學校遷移較遠，大部分學生，或將因往返不便而轉入他校。所以一個學生相當發達的學校，如果被迫過甚，不得已而遷移他處，學生準會大量减少，甚至不能維持。這就是學校本身，交還所賃校舍的難題。</p>
<p>而且問題的嚴重，更不僅在此。兩和界的私立學校，十分之九校舍向人租借，如果合同期滿，業主逐一堅持收回，那麽七八百所學校裏面，所有兩三萬以上學生，將無地求學，而一萬以上的敎師，也將被　滾進了失業的旋渦裏面，無瞰飯之地了。</p>
<p>因此，業主無論爲維護敎育事業，同情敎師的失業，靑年的失學諸問題，對於所出租的校舍，不能和普通的房屋一樣看待，應誠意的使學校方面，繼續承租下去，才是明於大義。</p>
<p>就我們所知道的，一般的私立學校，為了校舍向人租借得來，每年的經費，在房租方面，支出是相當鉅大，此種　大的支出，影響到學校的設備，敎師的薪給。　校對於業主，旣履行　最大的義務，而業主對於校舍，還是要堅持着收回，於情於理，似乎可以再加考慮吧。</p>
<p>現在當局方面，已一再表示，對此問題，將盡　最大努力，設法處理，務使不會惡化下去，這在敎育界方面，果然可稍得安慰。但另一面，我們所切盼的，在業主方面，巳提出收回校舍要求的，能勿再堅持，而未有此見思者，能勿步前一種業主的後塵。大家要顧到有益社會的敎育事業，任何人應加以維護而不宜摧殘，把私人的利益放在社會福利的後面才好呢！賢明的業主，諒不河　斯言。</p>
<h3>實業部梅部長　昨招待日工商界　闡述戰時經濟政策要旨　盡量吸收物資以供需要</h3>
<p>實業部梅部長於前（二十一日）日下午五時、假座華懋飯店舉行茶會、到有本埠實業界領袖一百三十餘人、闡明政府參戰後對於戰時經濟政策之意旨、各　　誌昨報、茲悉梅部長、袁次長復於昨（二十二）日下午五時、仍假華懋飯店舉行茶會、招待友邦日本在滬工商各界鉅子　由該部在滬各局局長項峋·孫祖基·陳中·章駿等分別招待、席間梅部長闡述　府戰時經濟綱要、旋由上海日本工商會議所主席靑木節代表全體日商來賓致答謝詞、至六時半始盡歡而散、茲將各　分誌如次、</p>

<p>致詞</p>
<p>首由實業部梅部長闡述國府戰時經濟綱要之大意、略謂「國府參戰後、最重大之責任爲謀國內鏗濟之復興、俾增加生產、而以物資供給戰爭、過去五年中國之生產量如蠶絲·棉花等、均巳大見减退、究其原因、由於經濟制度之不善商業方法之不良、今後急應改善經濟機構、一切以戰爭爲第一、儘量吸收物資以供需要、勝利乃能有望、至吸收物資方式日商力大者山日商担任、華商力大者由華商扣任、雙方合作後力大者由　　担任、要不外乎、此三種方式而已、希望在華日本經濟界領袖一致協力、以達目的、不特中國有益、日本亦有利焉、今日招待不週、殊深抱歉、希望在座諸君、多多發表宏論，以供國府參考」、</p>
<p>答詞</p>

<h3>南市押當　查封數十家</h3>

<h3>南市衛生所舉辦　免費佈種牛痘</h3>

<h3>減低市立小學收費</h3>
<p>— 章蘋</p>
<p>小學生者，國家未來之主　　也，故小學敎育之良　，有關國家前途之興衰强弱，至深且鉅，市府當局，爲普及小敎，嘉惠淸寒起見，事變後即設小學多處，不收　費，市區同胞，同深感戴。</p>
<p>肄業於市立小學校者，初僅繳納書籍費數角，後以物價高昂，略有增加。筆者有子女三人，修業於　立浙興小學二三四年各級，詎本學期開學，各領得國定小學敎科書國語，常識，算術三冊，總　不逾三元，而應繳書費，竟一躍而至每人三十元之多，旣不分別程度，亦不塡給　據繼悉隣兒之肄業於同一市立之虹鎭小學者，納　又屬不同，計年級十七元，二年級十九元，三年級二十二元，四年　二十四元，各給收據爲憑。竊思私立學校，或有多收費用之舉，本不足怪；　市立小學之增收齋費，諒必另有原因。惟在多數貧寒子弟之立塲，對此數十元之書籍　，仍有其不勝負擔之苦楚。設若子女稍多，勢必因而輟學，未免有悖普及敎育之初旨。近見報戰，陳市長方以巨款捐充淸寒貸學金，故深望　賢明之　敎育當局，亦能本市長推愛學子之精神，將下列數點付諸實行，則裨益　年曷其有極！</p>
<p>（一）酌量减低書籍費，最好能照價實付。</p>
<p>（二）通令所屬各小學一律收費，以免參差，並在收費時發給收據，以資憑　。</p>
<p>（三）某書兄姊已經讀過，仍可作爲弟妹之課本用者，予以通融，免購新書，以節物資。</p>
<h3>南洋各地特輯之三　菲律賓的今昔（五）</h3>
<p>— 選民</p>
<p>日軍對菲島的軍政財政，採取「現地自活」方針，也就是就地取給方針，在舊有的臨時軍事費特別會計以外，特設「軍政會計」，將有關軍政的會計，全部包括在內，而軍政監部部的會計，則按特別會計，另行處理。菲島行政府的預算，也作爲一種特別會計，而包括在軍政會計之中。軍政會計的財源，在於修改舊有法規，　輸出物資，以一種類似關稅的形式，賦課新稅，不足之數，則對軍管理工塲之利潤，以對日軍繳付金形式徵稅以爲　補，因此二大財源，軍政財政從臨時軍事費特別會計中完全獨立。</p>
<p>金融方面，一向由美元支持的菲幣比索，由於與美元之關係之切斷而有崩潰之危，因　實行比索與軍票等價，維持其價値，便利共流通，使新舊貨幣，渾然一體化。至於當地的金融機關，對於馬尼拉的七家敵性銀行，已實行整理淸算，一掃英美色彩：日系銀行三家，和菲島系銀行四家，則已復業，自七月起，南方開發金庫菲島分庫開業，與前述各行　同對開發關係各企業實行貸款及吸收游資。於　戰後混亂的金融已呈安定。</p>
<p>經濟方面·菲島的國民經濟，完全奠基於農：而農產物輸出總額的八成爲輸　美國的，這種澈底對美依存的經濟組織，實爲大　亞　榮圈內最不易應付的事業，現在正由日軍當局　軍政監部協力改善。經濟建設的要點，在於對日本提供維持戰爭遂行所必要的資　，首在鑛產資源之取得與繼續，並督促棉　苧麻等栽植。在鑛業方面，轉變採金中心爲以採銅及錳爲中心，現在對銅、錳、鉻、鐵等的採掘，已經開始，其他也力謀恢復中。同時，一部份糖蔗耕地，巳改　棉化。十月底，呂宋島耕地面積的十分之六已開始植棉，其次爲在岷大拿峨島植麻。此外椰子、馬尼拉麻，　業也爲供應日本內地及共榮圈內的需要開繼續生產。又爲確保糧食計，於去年初展開糧介增產　動，實行閑地耕地化，移入日本米改良種，及代用糧食農產物之增產等、都已先後實施。</p>
<p>爲了調節菲島物資的需給，一面有計劃地生產物資，一面統制各配給部門。成立了菲島生活必需物資配給統　組合，軍　理米穀會社，液體燃料配給統　組合，糧食統制組合等等，各主要物資，都巳各別地成立各種配給物資的統制機關。對於米及其他食糧品，火柴，衣料，肥皂等日用品及各種主要物資，一切都已有計劃地實行票劵制和配給制，規定適當的價格，在日軍嚴重的監視之下進行。又在物資之開發，收　與運輸，先後組織鑛由塲議會、棉　栽培協會、椰子收買組合、木材統制組合等，作爲日軍的指定機關，排斥中間收買者，對生產者直接收買一切物資，通過上述各組織，交付於菲島輸出入物資處理組合，經過日軍之手，向日本內地及共榮圈內各地輸出。</p>
<p>交通方面，陸方交通已排斥過去汽車中心主義，改取鐵路方針，同時在河道及沿海等利用船舶運輸，以增進收取資源的效果。菲律賓羣島內相互連絡，最重要的是海上交通，主要的是動員所有起卸貨船及民間小型機器帆船，並且利用豐富的木材資源而在當地建造大量的木船。</p>
<p>文化方面，注重在（一）美國文化之淸算，（二）爲創造在東洋文化而促進對日本文化的理解，（三）復興菲島固有文化三點。具體的對策，在軍報道部的領導之下進行，而新菲島音樂協會，新菲島美術協會等，都已先後成立。菲島的文化工作，現在由軍報道部直接指導與監督，統制報紙廣播，電影，雜誌，音樂各部門，占領當時殆已閉塞的文化機關，也漸形復活了。現在報紙方面，除英文的特利賓，西班牙文的拉班加爾蒂雅，及日本人經營的日文馬尼拉日日新聞及英文星期新聞獰得許可之外，已全部停　。不過軍宣傳班廣泛地推進壁報等運動，展開新東亞的新聞事業。廣播方面，日軍接收KZRH電臺，作為對民衆敎化，啟蒙，宣傳的重點。電影方面，爲安定人心，新設中央配給機關，早於去年二月一日開放馬尼拉八大電影院，其他地方電影院也次第開放，過去美國電影，均經軍報道　檢閱，並提供軍報道部所作的菲律賓新聞片及日本新聞片，以外並爲補電影片之不足而在電影院演出戲劇，音樂等。</p>
<p>敎育方面，宣佈新敎育万針，要點爲加强日菲親善，排除歐美依存思想，排斥物質偏重，涵養　義普及日語，廢除英語；普及初等教育，振興實業教育；鼓吹勤勞精神等。而恢復學校的順序，係由初等至高等，由公立至私立，由職業敎育至普通敎育。現在再開及預定再開的公立學校有四百所，學生五萬四百十六名，私校二百八十所，學生二萬二千名。大體都是幼稚園，小學及高小，中學校在準備中。爲了建設菲島經濟，特別車視職業敎育，公立農業學已恢復開學，中等學校亦置重點於職業敎育。在敎育中，最大特點爲規定日本語敎育，實現「日語公用化」。</p>
<p>菲律賓的民族運動</p>
<p>西班牙統治菲島的最後五十年，即公公元一八五〇—一九〇〇年間，是菲島「進步與革命時代」，也是菲島民族獨立運動的發剏時代。隨着歐洲產業革命的勝利，自由主義和人道及人文主義的思想，一切進步的思想，風靡到太平洋上，而菲島也沐浴在此歐風美雨之中，英國在一八三四年向亞洲活動，馬拉尼開港，成爲菲島產業發展之重大的契機，促發菲島以地主商業資本家爲中心的新興資產階級的產生和發展，於是，對於衰退的西班牙的封建的支配，不斷的推進了革命的叛亂，光榮地寫出了民族獨立運動的初期歷史。倘使當時這種民族運動獲得成功，那麼，菲島的政治經濟文化，一定爲另外的一個姿態了。可是美西戰爭的結果，菲島的政治權由西班牙人轉入美帝國主義之手，這裏還有着二千萬美元「金彈」的恥辱史，有着民族運動領袖之叛變和受欺的痛史，尤其是有着美帝國主義對菲島民族運動之收買，分化和血腥的武裝鎭壓的血史。菲島的民族運動，復於在美國侵略者之僞「獨立」　欺騙和武裝鎭壓之下失敗了。美國一方面有意地拖延實現「獨立」的時期，一面加緊促進菲島經濟對美依存的過程。這裏，菲島支配階級之墮落，民族領袖的叛變，和美帝國主義者的奸惡，都是絞殺菲島民族解放運動的劊子手。</p>
<p>但是，這是過去的事了。現在，菲島又到了新的時代，到了自主自救的新時代了。出於過去菲島經濟有形無形的受着美國的支配，至於無由自立，一切仰仗美國一旦把美國倚靠者的關係斷絕了，一旦美國的鎖鏈掙斷了，一時的混亂，這是必然的現象。現在菲島人民和菲島　悠久的友人與同居者華僑面前的問題，就是如何在這混亂中認淸自己澈底解放的前途，堅靱的奮鬥，作爲東亞民族最先解放的模範民族！</p>

<p>經濟評言</p>
<h3>促進內物資交流</h3>
<p>最近國民政府公布之戰時經濟政策綱領，特別注意於增加生產，尤其是要使工業之原料燃料，能得最便利之供給，並在適當的物價政策之下，保障農工生產者之收益，以獎勵其再生產，尤其對於農產品之購買，特別注意於農民之再生產，及農產品與日用工業品之交換。此種政策，確爲中國經濟復蘇之唯一命脈。已往內外物資之阻遏，交通機構之濡滯，已足使農工生計，日瀕困蹙而影響及於國家與民間之富力，實爲中國經濟上極大之隱憂。</p>
<p>我人欲挽救此項危機，惟有從促進內外物資交流人手，務使省與省間，縣與縣間，甲都市與乙都市間，各各實行『以其所有，易其所無』之辦法。靈活其懋遷，迅捷其交流，打破任何一切的困難，以促進全國一致生產爲目標。此爲我國今後經濟政策惟一之途徑。本市商會近向當局所提物資統制三原則：（一）統制不可趨於劃一化，須按各種物資重要程度之不同與其緩急之不一，予以合理統制。（二）上　與各地間之物資統制，現已陷於畸形之狀態，因而各地物價參差甚巨，各地域之物資交流，亦隨之甚受障礙。此後統制上海與各地間之物資交流，務須注意均衡與調和。（二）官一統制，希望减免，自主統制，希望提倡。所謂自主統制，當盡量利用舊有之同業公會而加强之，至中日商人　方提携合作，亦當保持彼此經濟能力之均衡，俾獨佔之弊無自而生。此爲促進內外物資交流之絕大貢獻。苟能如此，則上海廠商所渴望之原料，與內地人民急需之日用品，均可迎刃而解，各得其所矣，凡屬賢明當局，無不樂予接受願意實行。以昭蘇此垂困之民生。本月十五日國府最倚經濟顧問石渡莊太郞氏過滬，發表談話謂：「國府方面，正就力之所及，努力增强生產爲方針，目下擬採用內地生產之物資爲原料，復活上海方面之停工工廠，以促進上海與內地之物資交流，同時並促進華北華中間之物資交流。」云。就各地農產之原料，儘量供給各工廠之生產，同時以各工廠之機製品，儘量供給各地農村日用之所需。既足圓滑各地之物資，更足融通內外之經濟，苟能如此進行，即上海停工减工之工廠，至此亦以原料之取給有着，頓使無數工廠之烟囱，有繼續發烟之機會。生產旣速，貨物自多，至此雖不談抑制物價，而物價自有低落之可能矣。</p>
<h3>各地製絲工廠　大都改業</h3>
<p>近據華中蠶絲公司之地方視察團調查，華中各產蠶地區之原有小規模製絲工廠，最近大都改業或廢業。改業部分多將其原有製絲設備移往地方都市，改營他種產業。製絲工業前途之更將趨於黯淡，由此亦可窺見矣。</p>
<h3>日用品價格之漲風與其對策</h3>
<p>— 人沅</p>
<p>日用品價格的漲風近來大有不可遏止之勢，自滬地食糧計口授給後，米糧巳調得一公　的價格，人民生計得以維持。日用品如火柴，皂燭其需用數量雖不若米糧之巨，但均屬我人不可或缺之必需品，頻頻漲價，一方面影響個人與家庭之　算，一方面與衛生及其他方面有關；醫如肥皂的價格高貴，使一般人常無塵垢與蚤蟲爲伍：所以日用品雖均爲零星小物，然其重要性實不亞於米糧，全社會對米價漲落　以極大關心，而對日用品的價格則頗多忽視，實爲一大錯誤。</p>
<p>日用品價格的飛漲，可於數字中見之。民三十一年一月十五日市價爲：美麗牌火柴一千七百元，固本皂八十八元，白禮氏洋燭六十八元（均屬舊幣），不期祇隔一年　火柴漲起三倍，肥皂漲起十二倍，洋燭漲起十三倍，照近日情勢，洋燭市價似已入盤旋局面，但火柴肥皂漲勢仍漫無止境，觀下表可見其漲落大</p>
<p>照經濟學原理而言，供需的關係是價格的決定點，現在正在戰爭期中，原料來源的不易，存底的稀薄，部是不能掩飾的事實，這些事實都是使供給减少的因素因但在需求方面則因人民的麕集與囤積的盛行，因之大量增加。而能間接影響供需關係者，乃是投機者的操縱。</p>
<p>投機　與正常消　者有着二種不同的心理，前者囤積居奇的目標常是品質較高牌子較老的商品，而後者　因購買力漸漸薄弱，祇得退而求其次，所以要是沒有投機者的從中作祟，「久貨」的銷路一定必「高貨」活。照日用品價格的漲風看來，洋燭因爲上海不是牠的市塲，價格呆定，而肥皂火柴「高貨」的漲風遠較「次貨」爲烈，日用品市塲中，投機商人的掀風作浪，儘　扒購，情形非常　著。</p>
<p>要抑制日用品價格的漲風，治本的方法自然是設法增加生產，運輸暢便，這是技術問題，不在本文論述的範疇之內；這裏提出的是幾種治標的方法，而這幾種方法有的市政當局已經實行而收效不宏有的正想實和行而問題孔多，致使投機商趁此夕陽無限　的機會，造成了日用品價格的瘋狂上漲。</p>
<p>日用品價格瘋狂上漲的對策是：</p>
<p>一，限價限價是抑平物價一種取普通的方法，然而效力也是最不顯著。第一困難的是限價評定的不易，定得太高有失限價的本意，太低了，商人利潤减少，　易造成「有價無貨」的局面：第二困難的是執行的不易，因爲需求的不相應，難免黑市與「後門交易」的產生，消費者往往因爲無貨可買，寗願在黑市中向店戶商量，這樣一來，限價自然而然被破壞了。據一月十一日報載，五洲固本廠等訂定固本皂之限價爲每連軍票八十錢，黃祥茂爲每連七十三錢，廠家雖照此價格配給零售商，但消者要買限價却比登犬爲難，這種情形的產生有一種原因，一是配給不够走銷，二是中　人即批發商與零售商的剝削一個月前法租界各烟紙店因爲　賣　價香烟利潤不多，而又　於當局執行過嚴，以致門市相率停售，而將配給得米的香烟偷運釗公共租界在黑市中賣去，這樣限價不嚴或限價　嚴都使限價不易有顯著的成效。</p>
<p>二，檢查存底與取締投機檢查　底除貨品持有人自動聲請登記外，尙包括限制搬運等，這在需求關係上說，不失爲一種比較良善的方法，但聲請登記是否確實，檢查仔底是否普翻，這　都是有待商榷的問題，而限制搬運也常爲商人的欺朦取巧所破壞，因爲全剖禁止搬運旣不能，定出了定限制的數量，商人可以將整箱整包的物品拆開來，或改頭換面使檢查者辨別不易，甚至與檢查者勾通，在一定時期中大量偷運。至於取締投機，當局也曾實行過種種方法，如逮捕投機商，在市塲中監視買賣與封閉市塲等，然而投機商的逮捕終難一網打盡，在市塲監視，監視者每處耳目難周，而　閉市塲，則使投機商在街頭作「游擊式」的買賣，所以這些方法祗能求效於一時要謀久安之計，非重　考量不可。</p>
<p>三，計口授給　計口授給是　除中間商剝削，使物價安定最好的方法，據二月十六日報載，當局爲抑平物價，決狗於日用必需之品如肥皂，火柴，洋燭等，亦擬實行配給制度，假如這個消息實現，日用品價格的漲風將自然的遏止。（不要實現，就是一經傳出，一日之間各種火柴已回跌百元之巨，可見計口授給實是投機商人的致命傷。）</p>
<p>不過日用品的計口授給非完全沒有問題，第一，日用品的產量與存底究有多少？授給數量太多，產銷是否相應？太少，市民不够應用，勢必東搜西購，黑市仍難消滅。第二，日用品雖與米糧同屬市民必需品，但需用之數量有彈性，不若米糧之固定，計口授給制度實行後，市民不分階級，不論貧富，均有配給憑證可得，貧苦市民需用不多，且鑒於社會需要殷繁，勢必將憑證高價出賣，以期增加收入，如是貧苦階級的享受其衛生狀况每况愈下，而交易上非法現象仍難完全消滅。計口授給制度實行後，日川品價格的漲風可以遏止，但欲求其授給的合理化，決非貿然從事可以解決。</p>
<p>以上種種問　想市政當局早已考慮及此，更願海內宏達相互商討乃之。</p>
<h3>呢絨門市　生意大盛</h3>
<p>呢絨因種種環境關係，躉售市價，頗形高昂，日少成交。而門莊零剪生意，殊爲盛極一時。桃盤街一般呢絨店舖，每日門莊，大半俱售到二三元以至五六萬元。拆貨幫各家，亦可做達一二萬元以至三四萬元。　有人聞知不日價將上漲，故皆紛紛預購衣料。中西裝男女呢絨，銷路驟盛。情狀與昔大减價時不相上下。但店主因剪去越多，犧牲越大，故多露不安之狀。</p>
<h3>戰時經濟政策綱領釋要</h3>
<p>— 依人</p>
<p>—昨日泰晤士報之論文—</p>
<p>昨日（二月二十二日）泰晤士報載有論文一篇，扼要闡論本年二月十三日最　國防會議所通過之戰時經濟政策綱領，並加以理想的註釋。查論文中所列舉及註釋之各條款，係作者心理中所認爲戰時經濟政策綱領中的幾個要點。茲爲便利讀者參攷起見，爰於譯文中每一條款之下，用括弧註明其所論列者,係屬於戰時經濟政策綱領第幾條第幾款。</p>
<p>國府爲建樹戰時經濟基礎起見，特明定戰時經濟政策綱領，舉凡關於增加生產，調劑物價，節約消費，以及改組整個經濟機構諸端，無不備列。吾人對於此一經濟政策之藍本，不可不有充分之認識，爰舉戰時經濟政策綱領中　要點，加以註釋如左：</p>
<p>（一）增加農業生產，乃所以增加戰時的一切必需物品，如米、棉花，產油之種子，鷄禽　鷄蛋，猪牛羊一切牲畜。技術方面，尤須改進。（參　戰時經濟綱領第條（甲）款）</p>
<p>（二）開拓礦臧資源、乃爲供給軍須之必要條件。舉凡煤·鐵·銅錫之類，皆當盡量開採，若再益以日本方面之技術協助，收效必宏。（參看戰時經濟綱領第一條（乙）款）</p>
<p>（三）保障農工生產者之收益，乃爲最微妙，最重要之問題。保障之道，在於採取公平價格政策，藉以担保其收益。倘對於生產者所付價格過低，則生產者惟有將其產物作最大量之儲藏，最額之銷售矣。（參看戰時經濟綱領第一條（丁）款）</p>
<p>（四）改善運輸機構，必須注重於物資分配方面之改進。鐵路　內河運輸而外，尤須注意於海運。木船一項，在增進運輸效率方面，關係甚巨。至於運輸界之黑市運價，尤娘澈底剷除—此爲一件最困難之事。（參看戰時經濟政策第條（）款（五）調劑各種物價，當然有賴於投機與居奇之取締，以及居問者不當利益之免除，要知居問者亦有其本身責任，即貨物之包運　到是也。倘無居間者介平生產者與消費者之間，則政府對於配給貨物之效能，必須特別加以增進。（參看戰時經濟綱領第二條、丁（款）</p>
<p>（六）節約消費方面，最富注意於一切物資的浪費。一切高貴品與奢侈品尤須限制使用。消費者之需要物品，倘與戰時工業發生抵觸時，叫當以其他代替物品供給之。（參看戰時經濟綱領第三條（乙）款）</p>
<p>（七）調劑鄉融方面，最須設法使資金流入農村，而農村信用貸款機關，亦即於此可以恢復。此外如所得稅制度之調整，亦爲整進國家收莽之途徑。至於獎勵人民儲蓄，固爲調劑金融之良圖，然必須幣制經過長時間之穩定，人民方始樂於儲蓄，否則人民心理將終視貨物爲重於金錢矣。（參看戰經濟綱領第四條（丙）（戊）兩時款）</p>

<p>一、發起人會或　備會股份有限公司，至少有發起人七人，依現行習慣，常有發起人會或籌備會之舉行（法律上並無規定）此項會議之任務，通常爲：（一）議定公司名稱及股本總額，（二）議訂招股簡章，（三）推定籌備人員及代收股軟機關，（四）議定籌備處地址。關於資本額度，公司法並無規定；惟銀行，錢莊，保險公司及信託公司之敢低額，均爲五十萬元；企業公司，實業公司及工廠，無定額。其每股金額，依公司法第一一一條：「不得少於二十圓；但一次全繳者，得以十圓爲一股。董事名額，至少五人，監察人至少一人。公司之招股章程，以簡明爲主，與公司章程不同，不必過於詳明冗長。公司法第八十八條規定，應載明下列各款事項，簽名蓋章：一（一）公司名稱，（二）所營事業，（三）股份總額及每股金額，（四）本店，支店及其所在地，（五）公告之方法，（六）董事或監察人當選之資格，（七）發起人之姓名住所」等。招股簡章之首，常有冠「以緣起」者，將發起公司之動機及營業目標，撰文闡明，更有附列營業概算之數字者，將營業收入營業支出及資金運用辦法，分別列明，以引起投資者之興趣。二、籌備期內之工作主要之籌備工作如下：（一）依公司法施行第二十三條呈請主管官署備案：呈文內應附具，一·營業計劃書，二·發起人姓名，經歷及認股數目淸册，三·招股章程，由全體發起人具名．俟奉到批文核後，方得開始招股；但發起人認足股份總額者，得免除第，三·項附什。（二）印刷招股簡章，認股書及股款收據。（三）接治代收股款機關。</p>
<p>公司法第一一四條規定：「公司非經設立登肥後，不得發行股票。」故籌備期內收到股款時，僅能掣給股款收據，將來憑股款收據掉換正式股票。惟穩健之　行，代收新設公司之股款時，往往將該款另立一代收股款戶，須俟新設公司收回股款收據彙繳銀行後，方可將全部股款　入新設公司之往來戶內，准由公司提用。此種步驟，在銀行之立塲言，爲减輕自身對繳股人之責任，同時保障繳股人之權利，不能謂無理由。惟收受股款，距發打正式股票，往往需時數月，在此期間內，公司難免有需用款項之處，而銀行暫時不准提用股軟，則頗感不便。爲補救此種困難起見，可請代收股款機關於代收股款時，掣給臨時收據，再由繳股人持向新公司籌備處換領股款收據；如此，則股款收到後，公司即可將銀行所出之臨時收據繳還銀行，銀行則將已繳還收據之股款，轉入公司之存款帳，供其支用。此項辦法，茶統分明，各方均能顧到，惟手續較繁耳。</p>
<h3>歐洲股市鳥瞰</h3>
<p>海通社柏林二十一日電：上週柏林股市穩定，數種略見上漲。荷蘭股市不振，購者寥寥。布魯塞兩股票買戶雖多，但頗難獲得。巴黎市塲有劇烈上落，至週末均趨下游。瑞典股市　週初殊爲搖動，至週未交易莊盛，局勢趨於隱定。</p>
<h3>芝加哥管家婦在黑市中　每週費用百萬金元</h3>
<p>二月二十一日里斯本電：美國芝加哥城中管家之主婦每一星期中消耗於黑市塲中之用費，約達美金一百萬元。因此，美國政府當局對於全國各處黑市活動之猖獗情形，極表驚訝。美國較大之城市中，黑市活動尤烈，例如畢資勃城中之肉類，平均每十磅中，僅有三磅可以購自官家屠塲。此種情勢在美國各處工業中心區，尤爲嚴重，以致主管配給之政府當局，大有窮於應付之慨。又據同日里斯本電稱：華盛頓巳成立一「配給委員會」，專門從事於食品之分配，該委員會成立時之布吿中，宣稱國內食品之需要日增，而食品之供給日少，勢必權衡人民由請時情勢之　輕，以定配給標準。無論如何，對於食品之統制，從此必須愈加嚴厲云。</p>
<h3>改善華中棉業　增植優良種子</h3>
<p>華中棉產改進會，爲期確保優良棉種起見，本年度決定擴大旣設採種圃，同時在恢復治安之主要棉產區，添設採種圃，增植優良棉種，以謀改良華中之棉種（二月二廿日大陸新報。</p>
<h3>日軍票堅定　聯鈔又小五分</h3>
<p>昨晨錢業公會拆息，掛一角八分，仍未更。</p>
<p>日軍票略趨堅定，同業互做價五元五角五分四六厘，小錢莊與銀號門市出入價五元五角四分半及六分。聯銀券再做小五分，經營者售出三元八角，收進三元七角五分。</p>
<h3>浮多擁擠　債市突起波瀾</h3>
<p>公債行市，昨初　人氣之高昂，繼續上漲甚猛。丙種由八元五角高至九元三角，但過高招賣戶，多日來浮多已見十分擁擠，適環境情形亦稍有轉變，當即見賣戶稍多，小價見六元七角，最後亦祇七元，波瀾之鉅，人心之恍惚，亦可想見。甲約為五元五角左右，乙種約為四元五角左右，丁種一時因現貨奇缺，曾一度見五元五角高價，但祇曇花一現，直瀉至二元六角，戊種爲三元五角左右，但亦一度見過六元，大上大落，前途必尙有大變化也。亦浮多太多自然之現象也。</p>
<h3>平賣黃豆派貨</h3>
<p>最近軍配當局，交予雜糧組之平賣黃豆六千包，該組巳於昨日開始派貨。分配辦法，規定：豆腐業每家七包，雜糧零賣商六包，醬園五包，炒貨業，豆芽業，豆製業等均四包，豆腐漿店一包。每担售軍票四十八元，比上次配給價猛提十二元。</p>
<h3>豆餅漸覺不支</h3>
<p>據有關方面消息，目下大宗豆餅，均積集滬上，成爲投機對象，而一般農民，反以價高，無力購買施肥，影響農作至鉅。聞當局將以九十五元至一百元之價，予以收買，實施合理支配。於是人心皆懷顧忌，多方支持，漸感乏力，市勢趨向疲途。計開：肥字豆餅一車，價一百十九元，又一禮拜交二車，價一百二十元，元隆豆餅五車，價一百十九元至一百十八元。甡記豆餅三月上交二千片，價一百二十一元七角半至一百十八元。上海廠餅二月底交一千五百片，價一百十七元至一百十九元。</p>
<h3>固本皂近千元</h3>
<p>日用品市面，賣價仍堅，勢難望下，昨市續見有漲無跌。計：鳳凰牌火柴五千四百元，美麗牌五千五百元，金鼎牌四千三百元，雜牌三千元。固本皂相近十元，昨為九百九十元新高價，白祥茂九百十元，黃祥茂八百七十元，剪刀皂九百五十元，白禮氏洋燭六百元，僧帽牌五百四十元，雜脾三百八十元。</p>
<h3>南洋派貨　行盤煙價提漲</h3>
<p>香烟市面，英美貨近來倐高倏低，頗呈盤旋之態，昨日做價均較前回升二三百元之譜。日烟漲跌絕鮮，而吿穩靜。國烟南洋昨忽派貨，行盤連從價稅較前提漲，故市勢堅穩。計：大英牌一萬三千二百元，老刀牌一萬零七百元，品海牌八千三百元，五華牌七千二百元，仙女牌八千三百五十元，日烟金槍牌三千四百元，金大樓四千三百元，紅玫瑰三千八百元，全祿牌四千元，二十枝三千五百元，指南牌三千四百元，國烟金字塔八千元，美麗牌七千三百元，金鼠牌四千四百元，白金龍四千八百元。</p>
<h3>苦杏逐步上展</h3>
<p>苦杏因到存不多，而產價劃申步緊，與日俱升，故申市亦逐步上展；兼之去冬價位尙宜，更易提高，連日藥幫頗有吸收，漲起二三成之譜　如來源無繼，尙須看緊。</p>

<h3>儲蓄</h3>
<p>— 史吿明</p>
<p>據生活學家的硏究，松鼠在夏秋的時候，常採集許多果子，分別貯藏在幾個樹洞裏，作爲過冬的食糧。到了冬天，松鼠就吃所貯藏的果子。不過有時會忘郤果子貯藏的所在，因此所貯藏的果子，有一部分爲別的松鼠偷吃了，有一部分霉爛了。</p>
<p>松鼠知道儲蓄」，防禦寒冬，在人們看來，是一種「好習慣」或「美德」。蟬和蝴蝶，在夏季只知唱歌跳舞；到了冬</p>
<p>第一，儲蓄是將目前可以節省下來的錢，留存起來，作爲他日緩急時應用。其目的，是爲「生活」，而不是爲了「發財」。這基本觀念，必須弄淸楚；否則，就會漸漸走上「守財奴」的路上去。</p>
<p>第二，如果有餘款儲蓄，注意安全第一。不可放重利，尤不可做擾亂社會的投機生意。</p>
<p>第三，儲蓄的錢，如果爲數極鉅，已超過自己和家庭合理的需要之外，應該自動撥出一部來，做些爲社會謀福利的事。</p>
<p>假如只知爲金錢而儲蓄，假如爲增加自己儲蓄的數字而剝削別人；這種儲蓄，就失其本意了。</p>
<p>人類的知慧，至少比松鼠爲高。如果不知儲蓄，那就愧不及松鼠。如果不自儲蓄，而偷吃別人的儲蓄；或自己儲蓄了而不善加利用；那眞可以和松鼠「相視而笑，莫逆於心」了。</p>
<h3>冒險的信仰</h3>
<p>— 遠濤</p>
<p>請不要：想我是在談高深的哲理，在寫「大而無當」的文章。相反的，我是在引證一種宗敎的理論，來評價當今社會上的一椿實事。</p>
<p>耶敎的聖經上有兩句名言：「信仰是所望之事的實底，是未見之事的確據」——讓筆者把它們借過來，來說明最近个樁社會性的實事所以成功之原動力。</p>
<p>大凡一種有益於人羣社會的事業或運動，當其成立之初總不免是勢孤力單，困難重重的：——旁觀者的嘲笑和懷疑，事業經費之異常短絀，以及各方響應者之寥若晨星，這些都是熱心於公益事業者認爲「家常便飯」的。但他們所以能茹苦含辛，以百折不撓之精神完遂其最初目標，使多數處於困境的同胞實受其賜——這種堅毅偉大的精神，究竟靠什麽做後盾呢？一言以蔽之：信仰，堅定不移的信仰——賴信自已的目標旣然純正，動機又是利他的，縱然在草創時代不免多所困難，然而公道目在人心，其成功之到來，以及「所望之事」之達致，是可以操券以待的。這成功和「所望之事」，都是所謂「未見之事」，但因爲有着「信仰」，終於得到了完遂的担保和「確據」。</p>
<p>前不多時，筆者偶爾同一位朋友談起「申報助學金」的辦法，承他推誠相吿：「這筆助學金的餘款祗剩下十一萬有餘，而所需的是三十幾萬，相差至少二十萬，還沒有着落……「不過，凡是一種有益於社會的事，無論經費够不够，都是非辦不可的。冒一點險，吃一點苦，終日爲社會奔走，呼號，甚至懇求，有什麼要緊呢？……這個險總得要冒的，即使沒有錢，我們也不管，也必把它辦下去……這幾句，筆者當時靜靜的聽了，並不曾引起深刻的印象，反以爲這是幾句門面話。但是日子一天天的過去，「顏色」便一點點的顯出來了，進來的捐款繼續不絕，同情的音訊如雪片飛來，在那短短的二十天中（截至筆者寫本篇的時候爲止），捐款的總數已超過四十萬了。</p>
<p>這不是「信仰」嗎？的確是，爲了他們相信：「好的事情雖無錢也得辦」；「公道自在人心」；「錢是捐得到的，祇要我們知道怎樣去推動」！</p>
<p>不過，這事情已發動得非常熱烈，捐不到錢又怎麼辦呢？於是乎他們一面「信仰」，一面「冒險」，（這是我的朋友自已說的）形成一種其堅如鐵的信仰——冒險的信仰」！這信仰，終於給了他們以豐富的收穫。</p>
<p>這是不折不扣的事實，不是吹什麽牛；這是信仰試騐的成功，不是空中樓閣。末了，我得替自己聲明一句：我不是申報的職員，也不曾受到他們的付託。我是信宗敎的，我有社會的良心，我不能不說！</p>
<h3>談醫德</h3>
<p>— 棄疾</p>
<p>行醫是最神聖的一種職業。一個醫生對於他的病人，負有極大的責任。病人未學醫道，處處地方惟醫生之言是聽，醫生說是綦種病，須用某種治法，病人絕對　信仰。所以醫生在開方投藥時，都格外謹愼，一定先要用種種方法，使診斷確切，然後下藥。如果自己不能決定病根何在，或者遇到疑難之症，深恐自己的學識不足以應付，那末寗可老實說明，請病家再請別的醫生會同診治，必定要硏究明白，然後決定該打針，或者該動手術，以及種種的治法。在這種地方，尤其是名醫要特別的小心，因爲盛名之下，一方面病家的信仰愈堅，一方面然有一點錯誤，就不免累及盛名。所以從前著名的醫生，往往有因爲醫不好病人而竟致悲傷流涕者，下面是一個例：</p>
<p>在張大復的梅花草堂筆談中有一段題目名爲「發王」的記事：</p>
<p>「城有何繼充，遂令城內外無餘舍，水次無餘塢，老少婦女無餘閒，興無停晷，爨無停薪，手無停批，口無停答，殆駸駸在世醫王山中宰相矣。繼充診人不活，淚蘇蘇自落。」</p>
<p>還有一段記事，也述及這位醫王何繼充：「……何繼充多用人參，略與繆慕臺等，而二公名滿江南，活人無算……」</p>
<p>旣稱醫王，又活人無算，這種醫生，眞可以自豪了。然而他絕對沒有一點名醫的習氣，但知道一心一意的爲病家解除痛苦，好像病家的痛苦，就是他自己的痛苦。所以遇到診人不活，竟致情不自禁，淚蘇蘇自落，雖然明明知道有許多不治之症，醫生是無能爲力的，然而他一片惻隱之心，油然而生。終覺得自己沒有盡力，這種精神眞可直貫千古。如果醫生在　壺問世的時候，都抱這一種精神，那末我們不愁醫德沒有發揚光大的一天了。</p>

<h3>理想與欲望的分野</h3>
<p>— 程巨蓀</p>
<p>無論幹什麽事，人們對它總有一種目的—有的是理想的，有的是欲望的。</p>
<p>初經世故的靑年們，往往是理想勝過欲望，因爲剛離開家庭襁褓的學子，血氣方剛的靑年，對於社會的黑幕還不曾看淸楚，祇憑着他們合理的想像力，推測一切事物，循規蹈矩地實幹，來達到他們理想的目的，因爲理想是有現實的目標的，並不是憑空無據的口號，並且理路又是直截的，爽快的。惟有理想的生活才會給人們帶來光明和快樂的前途，所以他們成功的希望也十分有把握了。</p>
<p>可是當物質引誘得過甚的時候，意志不堅定的靑年，就會感覺自己享受的不足，而趨向到奢望的一方面。合理的想像遂變成了欲望的幻夢，爲了想達到這欲望的目的，他們就不得不挖空心思地到處搜求他們的需要，可是欲望祇不過是一種縹渺的妄想，它好像是一條崎嶇的山路，到處使他們遇着刺人的荊棘，使他們墮落在迷茫的幻夢中，生存在煩惱而憂勞的生活裏，因此成功的希望便如「空中樓閣」一樣地不可能了。</p>
<p>靑年們啊！世界上的欲望是無窮的，可是人的精力究竟有限，以有限的精力取無窮的欲望，則物之勝人，不管千萬，怎麽不使自己墮落到苦惱的深淵裏去呢，與其到那時受苦，還不如及早回頭，沈潛住自身的意志，站在本分的位置上，把握著「現實的想像力」，以百折不撓的精神實幹，那麼理想的成功不久就會降臨在你的眼前了。</p>
<h3>晒臺一角</h3>
<p>— 林李秀蓉</p>
<p>看到黃振榮先生的刊於本刊庭園改植蔬菜二文，我想起了我的晒台。我生性愛好田園氣息，可是在上海住在鴿子棚似的房子中，連向市塲買來的菜蔬都已小是新鮮的了，幸而還有一個見天日的晒台可以利用來過過田園癮。</p>
<p>晒台是公用的，上下三層的人家都要晒衣服，所以幾隻泥盆泥箱只能堆放在角隅。豆腐干一塊小地方，再加上不是泥地，不敢奢望會有什麽收穫，只望瞧瞧各式各樣的發芽開花結果。</p>
<p>石榴樹是買現成的，其餘南瓜，毛豆，豇豆，豆莢，荷蘭豆，蕃茄和辣椒都是自己下的種子，經過幾個月的施肥灌溉和捉蟲，就有了成績然一着是事實，却速自己也似乎不敢相信，居然每樣都有了收穫，豇豆最多，毛豆僅七八顆，南瓜有半斤重，而且只有一隻。果實雖然少，但是地方也小，一眼望過去，倒也是離離盛貌，心中的喜悅眞小是筆墨所能形容的。</p>
<p>這些收穫少得固然不足一嘗，毛豆收穫七八顆，下種還不止此數呢，但是至少有帶來的教育價值。幾個孩子，或在高中初中，或在小學，他們對葉子顏色的變化，雄蕊雌蕊的異同和結果以及蜜蜂的傳花粉都很注意，偶爾帶了同學來家，必引上晒臺，亦能娓娓敘述各種生長情形。我播種時只顧及自己的田園癮，後來方才注意到這相當有意思的活課本。</p>
<p>又是近下種的時候了，有了去年的經騐，今年的收成想必可以更好！</p>

<h3>On Thorough Current Price and Implementation Methods</h3>
<p>After briefly discussing "Strengthening the Control of Commodity Prices," I deeply feel the importance of the issue and that further elaboration is necessary. We have always believed that the current price problem is not a local or regional issue, and therefore cannot be solved by local or regional means, but must seek a comprehensive solution. Therefore, we, on the one hand, agree with the implementation of price controls in this city and other major cities as a model, but on the other hand, we also believe that comprehensive controls and price limits must be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The main content of the so-called comprehensive price limit is: Firstly, each province, city, and county should stipulate reasonable price limits for the prices, freight rates, and wages of important markets within its jurisdiction on a regular basis, and not only limit the prices of necessities such as food, cooking oil, fuel, sugar, salt, cotton yarn, cloth, and paper. Because commodity prices are like an organism, one hair can affect the whole body. Not only is the relationship between raw material prices and finished product prices, supply prices, and market prices very close, but also complementary. The prices of mutually competitive goods or production factor goods often affect each other, and factory prices, wholesale prices, and retail prices are also interconnected. Therefore, if the price limit only applies to certain specific types of goods, and the remaining prices are allowed to develop freely, then the specific types of goods will inevitably be affected by the price increases of other goods. Therefore, the scope of the price limit must include all goods. Secondly, the price limit must also be extended to all important markets. Because any change in commodity prices in any market is enough to affect the implementation of the entire price limit decree. Therefore, even remote areas cannot ignore their marketability and must be controlled. Goods must flow according to the price level. If only a few important cities are selected as control bases and the remaining markets are left unattended, then even if the inspection is strict, the escape of goods will still be inevitable. The proper and necessary exchange of goods between urban and rural areas cannot be made, and the price limit policy cannot be thoroughly implemented.</p>
<p>If comprehensive control and comprehensive price limits are implemented, then the situation will be completely different. Because after the implementation of comprehensive price limits, workers will not demand higher wages due to the increase in living expenses, and people's monetary income, although reduced due to increased taxes and savings, their actual income will not be reduced as it is now due to rising prices, and their savings can also be guaranteed, and will not be devalued due to high prices. Although the prices of manufacturers are limited, their costs can be fixed by guarantees. If prices continue to soar, then although monetary profits are high, the assets calculated in real terms have actually decreased. Manufacturers are believed to be very clear about this situation, so comprehensive price limits are a prerequisite for maintaining wartime economic and social order. Moreover, comprehensive price limits also help to fairly distribute scarce goods. If comprehensive price limits are not implemented, then some scarce goods will be monopolized by special and powerful people and wealthy people. In addition, to achieve the goal of each person getting what they need for some necessities of life that are in short supply, regardless of their ability to pay, we also rely entirely on the effective implementation of comprehensive price limits.</p>
<p>However, comprehensive price limits are not easy to implement. During the implementation process, general industrial and commercial operators will inevitably suffer some losses or encounter some inconveniences. Therefore, resistance is inevitable. At the same time, some selfish and self-interested people will take advantage of opportunities and other relationships to manipulate, hoard, evade, speculate, refuse to sell, and disrupt the market, and various bad phenomena will also occur. For this reason, during the implementation process, the authorities must act decisively and strictly crack down on these behaviors. When the power of the control agencies in various places is insufficient, in addition to assistance from the higher-level control agencies, economic inspection teams should also be organized to assist the control agencies in strictly cracking down on hoarding, evasion, and black market transactions, exposing general illegal activities, and rewarding people for reporting illegal activities, and the people's agencies should supervise the implementation of price limits. The use of this kind of political power is naturally not easy to give full play to its effectiveness when the organizational structure is not perfect and the control technology is still inadequate. Therefore, on the one hand, the implementation must absolutely comply with the law, and all arrests and fines must be absolutely based on the law, so that the industrial and commercial circles are convinced and avoid causing market chaos, depression, and social panic. On the other hand, it also relies on the assistance of economic power. The various material agencies should prepare a large amount of materials to supply the market. After a considerable period of adjustment, the control gradually becomes strict, and the market transactions return to normal. This measure can be gradually reduced, and people's hearts can gradually stabilize due to the implementation of price limits, the profit is limited, and the trend of skyrocketing prices is reduced, then the price limit policy can also be smoothly promoted.</p>
<p>When the comprehensive price limit policy is implemented, it is also necessary to strengthen the control of the production, purchase, transportation, and sales of market materials, dredge materials from various places, and regulate market supply and demand, so that the implementation of the price limit policy can be sustained. However, the prerequisite is that various material controls must be coordinated with the price limit policy and implemented universally in various regions. Under the current situation, the various controlled material agencies set up by the central government and various provinces and cities may not be able to directly manage and coordinate, and they also need to divide the work and cooperate to obtain close contact: the scope of work can be divided, and the methods and steps must be consistent, so as to avoid mutual division, restriction, and conflict, which will hinder the "principle of free flow of goods." In the current situation where various conditions are insufficient, the implementation of comprehensive price limits must also adopt the principle of gradual advancement; at the same time, we must also pay attention to the reality that many fundamental price measures in various aspects are not easy to increase and not easy to curb price increases. Overly strict implementation of the price limit policy will inevitably lead to the malpractice of harming businesses and harming the people. Producers are unwilling to produce more, and merchants are unwilling to work hard to operate. Selfish and self-interested people take the opportunity to steal and evade, and are unwilling to implement them. Or, enforcers may abuse their power and undermine the law for personal gain. In this way, although the price limit can be forced for a while, it is difficult to expect it to last and obtain the actual effect of price equalization. Therefore, in the implementation process, we must give appropriate adjustments to various price limits, and always inspect the market situation. After a considerable period of time, continue to adjust. If this adjustment step is a general price limit item, various regions must coordinate and be consistent, and the adjustment period cannot be too short. Before the price limit is adjusted, if the cost of important goods actually exceeds the price limit, or there is no profit, it can be approved by the local control agency to give a separate adjustment to encourage production and increase operations.</p>
<p>In short, the implementation of the restriction policy should be to adapt to the current situation, first stop the unreasonable rise in commodity prices, control in many ways, gradually adjust, and gradually stabilize commodity prices in various places, so that the price limit policy can achieve considerable results in the initial implementation stage, avoid adverse side effects, and then thoroughly implement it. Only in this way can we improve people's lives, consolidate social order, and implement the government's wartime national policy. If we only seek quick success, pull up seedlings to help them grow, be dazzled by theory, and ignore reality, then harming businesses and harming the people, hindering production, and disrupting the market will not see its benefits before suffering its misfortunes, and it will certainly not be what the wise authorities want.</p>

<h3>Defeat of the US Navy</h3>
<p>The US Navy tried its best to defend Guadalcanal Island, but it was defeated in every battle. Since August of last year, the US side has completely failed in several naval battles there. A total of 92 ships have been sunk or damaged, 38 have been injured, and 1,311 aircraft have been lost. If the damage since the Hawaiian Sea is included, the United States has lost 70% of its battleships, and the loss of aircraft carriers is even greater, and cruisers are also not a few. The US side insisted on defending Guadalcanal at a great sacrifice, hoping not to allow Japan to make any progress.</p>
<p>Since last spring, the submarines of the Axis powers have exerted their power. According to the latest announcement from the German High Command, the enemy ships sunk by submarines alone average 200,000 tons per month, and the total has been more than 31 million tons from the beginning of the war to the present. At the same time, Japanese submarines have also been quite active recently, rushing into the US-Australian supply line on the east coast of Australia. Although it has not been long from mid-January to early February, they have sunk six enemy transport ships full of military supplies.</p>
<p>Someone once questioned Churchill about dealing with the submarine problem. Churchill's explanation was that the damage caused by submarine attacks had a tendency to gradually decrease. Even if his disguise was true, there was no way to stop the Axis submarines from being active in the Atlantic. Recently, its powerful newspapers also criticized Churchill's remarks, believing that no matter how Churchill quibbled, it would be difficult to hide the truth. The damage to British and American ships has exceeded their new shipbuilding. The British Times also revealed a pessimistic tone, admitting that the damage in the Atlantic was heavy, and only waiting for the escort of the US Navy, and the American newspapers also said this. Therefore, no matter how many ships the United States builds in the future, a part will always be lost in the Atlantic. This is the trend of the situation and cannot be forced. Taking a step back, even if shipbuilding is successful and all past consumption is replenished, it is enough to equip the east and west oceans, but they have already lost more than 20,000 well-trained navies. Even if material resources are not a concern, how can this kind of human resources be replenished overnight? Isn't its major flaw still not repaired?</p>
<p>The Japanese Navy's battle in the Pacific can not only determine the situation in the Pacific, but also prevent the US Navy from attacking Europe, and boost the activities of German and Italian submarines. This contribution is not small.</p>
<p>Here, the connection between the Eastern and Western battlefields occurs. As long as we cooperate with each other to use this fast connection, our Axis powers will undoubtedly succeed in the final victory! (Yunpeng: Translated from the Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi on February 15)</p>
<h3>With the Understanding of the French Government, Japanese Troops Enter Guangzhou Bay, Japanese Troops Occupy Leizhou County Seat, Continue to Pursue Remnants of the Defeated Chongqing Army</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 5:00 pm on the 22nd that the Imperial Army and Navy troops had entered the French concession of Guangzhou Bay on February 211th with the understanding of the French government.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) The Japanese Army had not sent troops to the French concession of Guangzhou Bay. However, recently, due to the enemy's, especially Chongqing's, actions in Guangzhou Bay, which were quite obvious, the Japanese Army and Navy, in order to prevent problems before they occur, and based on the Japan-Vietnam Joint Defense Agreement and with the understanding of the French side, sent troops to Guangzhou Bay. Prior to this, on the morning of February 16th, with the cooperation of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, the Japanese Army carried out a surprise landing in the eastern part of Leizhou County on the Leizhou Peninsula, breaking through about 1,500 meters of muddy wetlands, and occupied the Leizhou County seat at 10:30 am, and continued to pursue the remnants of the defeated Chongqing Army. At 2:00 pm on the 21st, they entered the French concession of Guangzhou Bay to secure the area and its surrounding areas. Also, the entry of the Japanese Army this time is completely different from the illegal invasion of the French-owned Madagascar Island by the British Army. The Japanese Army entered the area with the understanding of the French government, and took responsibility for the defense of the area in close cooperation with the Vietnamese army.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 22nd (Central News Agency) The Japanese Southern China Army announced on the 22nd that the elite troops of the Japanese Southern China Army, in close cooperation with the naval and air force units, had successfully carried out a surprise landing on the east coast of the Leizhou Peninsula at dawn on the 16th of this month, and occupied the Leizhou County seat at 10:30 am that morning, and continued to sweep the surrounding areas of the remnants of the defeated Chongqing Army. At 5:00 pm on the 19th, they completely occupied Suixi, a stronghold of the Chongqing Army, and immediately concluded a local agreement with the authorities of the French concession of Guangzhou Bay. At 2:00 pm on the 21st, the Japanese Army and Navy simultaneously entered the area.</p>
<p>Chikan, Guangzhou Bay, 22nd (Central News Agency) The Japanese Southern China Army and Navy triumphantly entered the French concession on the afternoon of the 21st with the welcome of the citizens of Chikan. That evening, the Japanese Army entered Xiying Port. Guangzhou Bay after the entry of the Japanese Army, with the appropriate cooperation of the French authorities, is in excellent security, and the market situation is as constant as usual.</p>
<p>Cunjin Bridge, 22nd (Central News Agency) After the Japanese Army occupied Suixi on the 19th, they launched a clearing war against the remnants of the Chongqing Army in the area on the morning of the 20th. Another Japanese Army unit attacked Menggong on the Suixi-Zhanggong Road for 25 kilometers, and arrived at Cunjin Bridge at 3:10 pm that afternoon. According to the location, this place is the contact point with the French concession of Guangzhou Bay. Since landing in Leizhou, the Japanese Army has overcome all the difficulties in marching and has advanced 160 kilometers.</p>
<p>Location of Guangzhou Bay</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 22nd (Central News Agency) The French concession of Guangzhou is located in the eastern part of the Leizhou Peninsula in Guangdong, facing Guangzhou Bay, and includes the two islands of Donghai and Lao Zhou in the bay, with an area of 1,000 square kilometers. Most of the residents are Chinese. The area was leased to France for operation by the Qing government in 1898 (the 24th year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty). At first, it only occupied a corner of the eastern part of the peninsula, and then leased two islands the following year, forming the Guangzhou Bay area of the French-owned Vietnamese Federation today. At that time, France's purpose of leasing the area was to create a larger economic base than Hong Kong, so it designated Chikan Xiying as a commercial area, and Xiying also built a wharf, which is a free trade port. However, due to various reasons, it never achieved its intended purpose. After the Sino-Japanese Incident, the importance of the area suddenly increased, and trade gradually became active. After the aid route to Chongqing through Vietnam was cut off in June 1940, the aid route to Chongqing in Guangzhou Bay was also strictly sealed off. A Japanese monitoring office was also set up in the suburbs of Xiying. To this day, Xiying to Chikan is 18 li, and Chikan is a city located between the Chongqing area and the French concession.</p>
<h3>Main Points of Chairman Wang's Address to Officials and People in Xuzhou Some Days Ago</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing) The National Government Chairman visited the Xuzhou Public Assembly Hall at 1:00 pm on the 19th and gave a speech to local organizations, people, students, and Japanese residents. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow countrymen, friends from foreign resident groups, ladies and gentlemen, brothers, I have two feelings about this trip to Xuzhou. First, the Xuzhou area is a famous historical site in China. In the four unified eras of the Han, Tang, Song, and Ming dynasties, two eras were founded in this area, one was Emperor Gaozu of the Han Dynasty, and the other was Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty. The people in the Xuzhou area have always had simple customs and vigorous heroic spirit. I firmly believe that all of you fellow countrymen will be able to expand the patriotism passed down in history and take on the great task of saving the country and promoting Asia. Last night, I saw the welcoming people along the way, full of vitality. This morning, my father saw the lively and brave Zhu'an team and youth groups, which made me think of the fellow countrymen in Xuzhou, a famous historical site, who used to have these customs and this heroic spirit. Today, they still preserve these customs and this heroic spirit. I cannot express my joy. Second, the Sino-Japanese Incident five years ago had a fierce battle in this area. Thinking about it now, I still feel heartbroken. Since the launch of the peace movement, we have been striving forward on a thorny path, following the teachings of Sun Yat-sen's Greater Asianism, in order to heal the wounds of the past and build a good-neighborly and friendly foundation. I have heard from Chief Hao that there are 13,000 foreign residents in Xuzhou. These 13,000 foreign residents and our Xuzhou fellow countrymen live together day and night, love their own countries, love their neighbors, and love East Asia together. With this pure and loving heart, we can finally transform the place of great pain into a harmonious and peaceful area. How can I not admire this brave spirit?</p>
<p>The above are my feelings about coming to Xuzhou, one is the past events of thousands of years of history, and the other is the specific facts in recent years. Now I plan to say a few words in a nutshell about the situation of the Greater East Asia War, the European situation, the significance of China's participation in the war, and our efforts.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the situation of the Greater East Asia War and the European war. Since our ally launched the Greater East Asia War, within half a year, it swept across Southeast Asia and established a solid foundation. Why do we say that a solid foundation has been established? Because this operation is an amphibious operation. Our ally has obtained the battle results of last year, and the air and sea forces are all over the Pacific bases. Among them, the air force base is the most important. Based on the experience gained from the Greater East Asia War and the European War, for an amphibious operation, we must first control the air before we can control the sea. Our ally has already established countless air force bases in the Pacific. The power of the air force base is by no means comparable to any aircraft carrier. Under this situation, it is conceivable that it will be difficult for Britain and the United States to carry out a counterattack with an amphibious operation. On the contrary, the safeguarding of last year's battle results and the expansion of future battle results are absolutely guaranteed. The bright future of the Greater East Asia War is self-evident. As for the European war, whether it is the German-Soviet war or the German war against Britain and the United States, according to reliable calculations by military experts (the explanation about military operations here is omitted), the Axis countries have long been in a superior position to win. After winter, it will be followed by a spring offensive, and the number of victories and defeats can be counted on the day. Its future is also optimistic and bright. Let's talk about the significance of China's participation in the war. Last year, when I went to Tokyo, Prime Minister Tojo solemnly said to me, "If 1 billion people in East Asia unite, no group of countries in the world has such a great power." The root of the victory in the Greater East Asia War lies in this, and the root of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere also lies in this. How can we unite 1 billion East Asians? In a simple sentence, we must love our own country, love our neighbors, and love East Asia together. Everyone can unite these three kinds of love into one, and then we can unite. Unity is strength. China has 450 million people. China is a part of East Asia. It has the obligation and the right to defend East Asia and build the great cause of East Asia. This is the greatest significance of China's participation in the war.</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about the efforts that should be made after participating in the war. On New Year's Day this year, I proposed three key tasks: to popularize the spirit and training of the New National Movement, to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War with this spirit and this training, to establish social order, and to increase production. These three tasks were already very important. They are even more important after participating in the war. I have said a lot about these three points in the past. Now I will only add a few words. This morning, I saw the flag of the youth group. In accordance with the regulations of the New National Movement Promotion Committee, the national emblem of the blue sky, white sun, and red earth is in the middle, and three arrows are united under the emblem. This is very meaningful. There used to be a story. One arrow is easy to break, but many arrows are hard to destroy. When a father was dying, he asked his three sons to each give an arrow. One arrow was easily broken. He taught them to put them together, and they could not break them. This means that no matter how much ability a person has, it is useless to work separately. Unity is strength. The three arrows have many meanings, and unity is the most important. Therefore, the three arrows symbolize the three brotherly countries of China, Japan, and Manchukuo. Therefore, arrows are used to express the spirit of bravery, diligence, and hard work. We are working hard today for the revitalization of China and the defense of East Asia. Speaking of China, we must unite the 450 million Chinese people. Speaking of East Asia, we must unite 1 billion East Asians. Unity is the foundation of revival, the foundation of certain victory in the decisive battle, and the foundation of coexistence and co-prosperity. As for the blue sky, white sun, and red earth flag, it was decided by Sun Yat-sen when he first launched the revolution. When the first uprising was launched in the year of Yihai, because the uprising plan was detected by the Qing court, it could not be carried out on a large scale. The revolutionary comrades had no choice but to withdraw from Guangzhou. Comrade Lu Haodong returned to the city to protect this flag from falling into the hands of the enemy, and was martyred. When Sun Yat-sen thought of the sacrifice of the late Lu Haodong, he was even more determined to use this flag as the national flag of the founding of the Republic of China. The meaning of the blue sky and white sun is obvious and needless to say. The red earth is the red flag of the Han Dynasty, and it is also dyed with the blood of Lu Haodong and the revolutionary martyrs. The youth group's flag uses the national emblem to unite the three arrows, which has a profound meaning. In short, the first requirement of the New National Movement is that everyone has a clear understanding of the future of China and East Asia, and has a firm belief in the victory of the Greater East Asia War, especially to enable everyone to obtain the spirit of unity in strict training and strict organization. Speaking of establishing social order, we must not only rely on the security team, but also on the cooperation of the people. The security of the Suhuai area is gradually being established. I hope that we can further rely on the cooperation of the people to seek the self-defense of the people, so that the local security can be fully established. As for increasing production and economizing consumption, there is a close relationship. We must know that no country is not struggling in hardship during wartime. This is true not only for belligerent countries, but also for neutral countries, and not only for defeated countries, but also for victorious countries. How can we struggle in hardship? On the one hand, we must increase production, and on the other hand, we must economize consumption. Last November 21, when I went to Japan, I saw factories in Tokyo, with chimneys towering into the clouds and smoke covering the sky, which showed that our ally was constantly advancing and increasing production in the war.</p>
<p>When I visited Prime Minister Tojo in Tokyo, I learned that the Prime Minister's residence was not heated, only the Prime Minister's office was slightly heated. On the one hand, black smoke covered the dog and a large amount of coal was used to increase production. On the other hand, even the capital's official residence was not heated in the severe winter to economize as much as possible. Comparing the two, I was really filled with emotion. From this, it can be seen that today we must not only increase production, but also economize consumption, so that useful material resources will not be wasted at all, and every bit will be used for effective production increase. Only in this way will economizing consumption be meaningful, and only in this way will increasing production be successful. The above three points are the key points of this year's work, especially the areas where we should redouble our efforts after participating in the war. Although I often say these three points, since they are important for today's work, I cannot help but repeatedly explain them to my fellow countrymen wherever I go, and encourage each other. With the simple customs and brave spirit of the people of Xuzhou, I am sure that the people of Xuzhou will be able to do it. Not only the people of Xuzhou, but also the people of the entire Suhuai Special Zone can do it. The people of the whole country must also be able to do it for the sake of saving China and protecting East Asia. What will be the fate of China? What will be the fate of East Asia? It all depends on our efforts in the future. The fate of China and the fate of East Asia are inseparable. China's independence and freedom can share the responsibility of East Asia, and China's independence and freedom depends on the liberation of East Asia. After the victory in the Greater East Asia War, it will be the time of China's independence and freedom. I hope that all of you fellow countrymen will embrace the spirit of bravery, diligence, hard work, and endurance, unite the people of the whole country, unite the Asian nations, and strive forward to win the victory in the Greater East Asia War. The future of East Asia is bright, the future of the world is bright, and the future of China is bright.</p>
<h3>Air Battle Ends on the India-Burma Border, Three Enemy Aircraft Shot Down</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 22nd (Central News Agency) The Japanese air force on the India-Burma border continues to suppress the enemy air force. The Japanese fighter squadron encountered three enemy Hurricane-type aircraft in the sky over the Arakan area on the India-Burma border on the afternoon of the 20th, and immediately attacked them fiercely, shooting them all down. The Japanese side suffered no damage, it is said.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Allied News Agency) According to the announcement of the Allied Forces Headquarters in the Southwest Pacific, the Japanese aircraft twice attacked two Allied Forces bases in New Guinea.</p>

<h3>The German Army's Fierce Offensive Breaches the Tunisian Border, Occupying the Key Pass of Kasserine. Elite British Forces Advance to the Front Lines as Reinforcements. U.S. Troops Face Hardships in Battle and Hastily Retreat Westward.</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Allied News Agency) - According to a broadcast from the Algiers radio station last night, German forces in southern Tunisia continue to advance and have occupied a pass in the Kasserine region.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Allied News Agency) - The Allied Headquarters in North Africa announced yesterday, "On the morning of the 10th of this month, enemy forces launched a major offensive northwest of Kasserine, achieving local progress." Furthermore, while British troops have reportedly arrived to reinforce the area, according to Reuters, the Kasserine Pass within the new Allied defense line has already been occupied by German forces. There are as yet no reports on the combat situation after the British troops advanced to the front lines. It is only known that the German offensive in the Sbiba area has made contact with British forces. The climate there is harsh, with minimal air activity, making land warfare particularly difficult. Troop movements, sustenance, and combat are all taking place in rain-soaked mountains. The fields are deeply muddy, making it extremely difficult for supply convoys to move. In the southern sector of Tunisia, the British Eighth Army launched an offensive against the outpost line before the Mareth Line last Saturday. Although there were strong sandstorms at the time, the German forces were able to detect it in time, allowing them to withdraw the sentries before the British troops arrived, thus avoiding encirclement.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Haitong News Agency) - U.S. forces in southern Tunisia are now unable to hold their positions east of the Atlas Mountains. Three key mountain passes southeast of Tébessa are now in the hands of the Axis forces, with the Kasserine Pass being one of them. The road leading to Tébessa is also under the control of the Axis forces. The Sbiba Pass is currently still held by Allied forces, and it is reported that the British have dispatched elite troops there to cover the retreat of the U.S. forces. Since today, German forces have made contact with them, and the British are putting up fierce resistance, but are only able to slightly slow down the Axis forces' advance. On another front, German forces are clearing out remaining U.S. troops in the newly occupied territories, seizing a large amount of war materiel. The U.S. troops fled in disarray, failing to move or destroy all supplies and fuel. The Germans welcome this, especially as it coincides with unfavorable weather conditions and transportation difficulties. Although the British have assembled a large force on the Mareth front, only minor skirmishes have occurred so far.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 21st (Havas News Agency) - Fierce fighting is still ongoing in Tunisia. Berlin has announced that after Axis forces occupied the U.S. positions in Gafsa and Pichon, they are now pursuing the enemy forces. According to a communique issued by the Allied Headquarters in North Africa, U.S. forces are now deployed along the line of Piveteau Tessa, which is about one hundred miles southwest of Tunis. (Note: Pichon is thirty miles west of Kairouan). The U.S. First Army in northern Tunisia has conducted reconnaissance activities, and there have been minor clashes between the two sides west of Pont du Fahs. Furthermore, the Italian High Command issued a battle report stating that there was a tank battle in southern Tunisia, where their armored vehicles, under the cover of aircraft, forced the U.S. troops to retreat westward.</p>
<h3>Battles in the Donets Basin Temporarily Reach a Stalemate. Renowned German Divisions Transferred to the Eastern Front Launch a Strong Counteroffensive in the Orel Region.</h3>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Haitong News Agency) - The fighting in the Donets Basin has now temporarily reached a stalemate. The enemy's offensive strength from north to south has weakened. Although Soviet forces are still attacking our positions on various fronts, they have been severely damaged and repulsed by the defending forces. Whether the current stagnation of the Soviet offensive is due to heavy casualties in manpower and materiel, or whether it is a reorganization of forces to make new plans, remains to be seen in future developments. A Soviet cavalry group recently annihilated by our forces yielded a large amount of war materiel, including hundreds of tanks, over a thousand horses, eighteen artillery pieces, and a large number of hand grenades. Several hundred prisoners were also captured. German forces launched successful counteroffensives in the mountainous area west of Slavyansk and in the Orel region. The ice and snow around the Kopen bridgehead are melting, greatly affecting operations. Local Soviet attacks there have been unsuccessful. German aircraft have been very effective in assisting ground operations.</p>
<p>Near the Soviet Border, 22nd (Havas News Agency) - According to German sources, the Red Army has been launching offensives for a long time and is feeling fatigued. Eastern Front sources say that the Red Army's offensive in the Donets River basin has been blocked by German forces. The fighting is currently stalemated, with no major changes. The German Air Force is actively participating in the battle, inflicting heavy casualties on the Red Army. Therefore, some observers believe that the heavy losses suffered by the Red Army in this offensive are the main reason for the cessation of the offensive. Other observers believe that the Red Army is currently reorganizing and redeploying its troops. Therefore, in some war zones, especially near the city of Lozovaya and in the Orel region, German forces have launched counteroffensives and made slight progress. A summary of the war situation in each area is as follows: (1) Orel Region: The Red Army launched a fierce offensive but encountered staunch German resistance. The Red Army attempted to occupy the salient east of the city of Orel in order to attack the city of Orel itself. However, the German defenses are solid, with a "hedgehog defense" system in place, making it difficult for the Red Army to succeed. The Moscow radio station announced today that elite German units have been defeated by the Red Army on this battlefield. It is reported that this unit is the renowned "Count Regiment," composed entirely of people from East Prussia, which had never fought on the Eastern Front before, but has now been transferred to the Eastern Front to launch a desperate counteroffensive. When their soldiers are captured, they still struggle fiercely. (2) Kursk Region: There are no major changes to report, as the focus of the war remains concentrated on the southern front. Red Army battle reports claim that the Red Army's offensive against the city of Sumy has reached the city of Gotnya (on the Lreliansk-Kharkov railway). In addition, the Red Army operating along the Kharkov-Poltava railway line has also made progress. According to general observers, the Red Army clearly wants to reach the eastern end of the Dnieper River bend before the ice melts, as once the thaw sets in, it will constitute the greatest obstacle to the Red Army's advance. However, given the current situation, with the weather already very mild and the German forces putting up staunch resistance, the Red Army will not be able to achieve its goal. (3) Southern Front: The Red Army attempted to capture the port of Taganrog on the coast of the Sea of Azov, but repeated attacks were repulsed by German forces.</p>
<h3>Maisky Urges the Opening of a Second Front. The Soviet Union Officially Denies Sending a Delegation to the United States.</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd (Haitong News Agency) - London reports that a rally celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Red Army was held in Liverpool yesterday. The Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Maisky, reiterated the demand for the opening of a second front at the meeting. In addition to requesting that the United Kingdom and the United States launch an offensive against Germany from Western Europe as soon as possible, he also stated that the Soviet Union is now considering immediately implementing the resolutions of the Casablanca Conference.</p>
<p>Moscow, 22nd (Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>Rumors that General Timoshenko has led a military delegation to the United States, or perhaps to South America, were officially denied yesterday by the Soviet authorities.</p>
<h3>New Inspector General of German Armored Forces Reports Directly to the Führer</h3>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Haitong News Agency) - The German Führer's headquarters announced that the German Führer, Hitler, has appointed General Guderian as the Inspector General of the German Armored Forces, reporting directly to the German Führer.</p>
<p>Guderian's Brief Biography</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Haitong News Agency) - The German Führer, Hitler, appointed General Guderian as the Inspector General of Armored Forces yesterday. Guderian's motto is "Armored forces fight independently." He believes that "armored forces are the standard offensive weapons." Guderian is 54 years old. When the German army was limited to 100,000 men, he served as the chief of staff of the motorcycle training department. Guderian made significant contributions to the reorganization of the 24 motorcycle units. When the armored forces were established in 1935, Guderian served as chief of staff. He fought in the Polish and French campaigns. Later, he served as the commander of the armored forces in the central sector of the Eastern Front. He left office due to illness in November 1941, but has now recovered his health and is serving as the Inspector General of Armored Forces.</p>
<h3>Turkish Prime Minister Reaffirms Neutral Policy Unchanged. Determined Not to Accept Secret Obligations. Willing to Maintain Friendly Relations with All Countries.</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 22nd (Haitong News Agency) - Turkish Prime Minister Saracoğlu gave a speech yesterday, solemnly declaring that Turkey will never accept any secret obligations. Turkey's policy has been subjected to rigorous tests, so its neutral policy will definitely remain unchanged, and he believes that a firm will will surely overcome the difficulties.</p>
<p>Ankara, 22nd (Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>After the Adana talks, the Turkish government's foreign policy has attracted great attention. Prime Minister Saracoğlu explained Turkey's neutral policy in parliament on the 21st, stating that the Turkish government's foreign policy is solely to maintain friendly relations with all countries. This policy has been very successful and will continue to overcome all trials and adhere to that policy. Even the relationship between Germany and Turkey will continue to advance based on the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression. Recently, a loan agreement of 100 million marks was concluded, under which Germany will supply Turkey with essential military materials. The relationship between the United Kingdom and Turkey is based on the Treaty of Alliance, and the friendly relations between the two countries were reaffirmed at the Adana talks. Relations with the Soviet Union are also becoming increasingly close. At the same time, the United States is also supplying Turkey with various military supplies under the Lend-Lease Act.</p>

<h3>Gandhi's Health Worsens, Now at a Critical Juncture. All Sectors in India Rise Up to Rescue the Mahatma. British and American Authorities Confer on How to Deal with the Indian Situation.</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 2nd (Allied News Agency) - According to reports from Pune, the Bombay government announced today that Gandhi's condition has been deteriorating since he began his fast and has now reached a critical juncture.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>According to reports from Bombay, Mahatma Gandhi, the 73-year-old holy man, has been fasting for twenty-one days, and today is the twelfth day. The Bombay government issued a communique today signed by six doctors stating that Gandhi experienced a day of restlessness and entered a crisis at 4:00 p.m. today, with severe nausea, almost fainting, and a weak pulse. He then regained the ability to drink water mixed with fruit juice and slept for five and a half hours. Today is Gandhi's day of silence. Although his heart is weak, he feels more comfortable and is in slightly better spirits.</p>
<p>Istanbul, Turkey, 21st (Havas News Agency) - According to reports from India, Gandhi's health is extremely serious. The authorities issued a report from six doctors today, stating: "Gandhi was restless yesterday, sleeping only four and a half hours during the night, and was dazed during the day. His heart is weak, his pulse is faint, and his physical strength is extremely poor. Even drinking water is difficult, although his intake is still the same as usual: 40 ounces of water plus 2 ounces of lemon juice. His weight was measured once on the 19th of this month and was 14 pounds less than before. He is now too weak to be weighed. If he does not stop fasting in the very short term, his life will be in danger and it will be impossible to save him."</p>
<p>Istanbul, 22nd (Allied News Agency) - According to reports from New Delhi, Viceroy Linlithgow's response to the resolution passed by the Indian all-parties conference for the immediate release of Gandhi was extremely vague. He said that Gandhi should bear full responsibility for his fast, and that it should be up to him to decide whether to stop fasting, and that it had nothing to do with the government. The various parties then convened another plenary meeting on the 21st, chaired by Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, head of the Liberal Federation. After four hours of discussion, they unanimously agreed to send a telegram to the British Prime Minister demanding the immediate release of Gandhi.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd (Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>According to reports from London, nineteen representatives of various Indian religions and parties called on Sir Homi Mody, the Indian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, today to urge the British government to pay attention to Gandhi's serious situation and demand his immediate release.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>Indian and British Indian groups in India and the United Kingdom have been demanding Gandhi's unconditional release, but the British government seems unmoved. Temples, mosques, and Christian churches throughout India prayed for Gandhi yesterday, Sunday. More than 500 students held a prayer meeting in the gardens of the University of Bombay on Saturday night. Indian residents in London convened a meeting yesterday and decided to send representatives to petition Prime Minister Churchill, and to write to the Secretary of State for India, Amery, the Minister of Aircraft Production, Cripps, and the ambassadors of the United States, Chongqing, the Soviet Union, Turkey, and Egypt to the United Kingdom, demanding Gandhi's immediate release.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd (Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>Regarding the trends in the Indian question after Gandhi's fast, there seems to be considerable dissatisfaction within the United Kingdom with the policies of Churchill and the Viceroy's office. When Gandhi first began his fast, the British press pretended to be unconcerned. On the 21st, British newspapers began to review the Indian question one after another, pointing out the seriousness of the situation. At the same time, U.S. Secretary of State Hull also held a long meeting with the British Ambassador to the United States, Halifax, who has considerable experience with the Indian question. It is rumored that the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States are currently negotiating the Indian situation. According to well-informed sources, Roosevelt may consider the impact of the issue on the anti-Axis camp and ask the British government to take appropriate measures.</p>
<h3>Japanese Express Deep Sympathy for the Fighting Spirit of the Indian People. Remarks by the Chief of the Information Bureau.</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The third chief of the Japanese Information Bureau, Hori, made the following remarks to a group of reporters today regarding the Indian crisis caused by Gandhi's tragic fast: Gandhi's current condition is quite dangerous. Due to the issue of Gandhi's health, there is still a possibility of unrest in India. Gandhi is enduring physical pain with great perseverance and is still continuing his noble and magnificent struggle for India's independence. The 400 million people of India, faced with this tragic scene, have also put forward the demand for the immediate release of Mahatma Gandhi and the realization of India's independence and freedom. However, the British government is treating this with indifference, and has not changed its attitude of contempt and trampling on the Indian people. However, we are not surprised by this attitude of the British government, as the story of how the British authorities dealt with India after the last war is very clear. During the last war, the British government had promised to permit India's independence. However, after the end of the war, the British government not only did not fulfill its promise to India, but also promulgated the even more severe Rowlatt Acts to suppress the legitimate speech of the Indian people. The so-called Amritsar Massacre is an indelible bloody page in the history of Indian oppression. But the British are treating this with equanimity, and are not considering Gandhi's life or death or the sacred demands of the Indian people. On the contrary, our Japanese Empire's attitude towards India has been clarified by Prime Minister Tojo in his speech to the Diet on January 28. At this critical moment for the Indian people, they should have a deep understanding and trust in our attitude. Prime Minister Tojo said that the Empire, for the construction of a new India, in addition to extending the greatest sympathy to the Indian leadership and people who are suffering both at home and abroad, also expects the rapid success of their great cause. The Empire will not hesitate to provide full cooperation. Given the direction of our country's policies, we are now watching the changes in the current Indian situation with the greatest sympathy and understanding. And the conviction is that the Indian people will definitely achieve the final victory. Mahatma Gandhi may inevitably die under the shackles of British imperialism, and there may be many other Indian leaders who will be sacrificed to British oppression. But we are convinced that the spirit of the 400 million Indian people to achieve independence, no matter how [illegible] the bewildered British government suppresses, will never [illegible].</p>
<h3>Macau Correspondence: The Extravagant Ones in Guilin City. Spending Money Like Dirt, Magnificent in Demeanor.</h3>
<p>This year, Guilin seems to be particularly prosperous. Brandy costing thousands of dollars per bottle and cigarettes costing hundreds of dollars per tin are said to be purchased as gifts. Everyone says that Guilin has become "Little Shanghai" or "Little Hong Kong." But when we look closely at the bottom of this society, how many families are in agony? High prices usually make it difficult for many people to breathe. In recent days, the prices of meat and vegetables have risen, and there are countless families where creditors are at the door and children are crying.</p>
<p>This year, because of the soaring prices, the lives of many civil servants and salaried workers are even more difficult. China is rich in natural resources, so at the very least, the problem of food is not as serious as in European countries. The problem is that the joy and suffering are too unfairly distributed. Especially those who make fortunes from national disasters spend money like dirt, magnificent in demeanor. They not only caused the rise in prices, but also disturbed the local order and diluted the tense emotions of society. Wang Chuanshan once said, "Merchants are those whom corrupt officials are eager to promote and favor; without merchants, corrupt officials cannot satisfy their unnecessary demands. Giving them honor and listening to their bragging, what do they have to fear? The wealth of merchants is at the expense of the poor. When profiting is easy, the use of wealth is frivolous; with petty ambitions and ignorance of restraint, with clouded minds and disregard for their own safety, they bully the poor and weak with ostentation, how can the country not be poor?" This is a true reflection of the rear areas today.</p>
<p>Emperor Gaozu of Han, after establishing the dynasty, issued his first order, strictly prohibiting merchants from wearing brocade and silk, and from carrying weapons and riding horses. This was because he deeply resented the merchants who "made fortunes from national disasters" during the Chu-Han Contention. Therefore, he strictly established this method of moral sanction. Now, we cannot use such harsh methods to punish these speculative merchants, and many merchants have fulfilled their responsibilities, and it is difficult to clearly distinguish between them and speculative merchants; if they were all punished together, it would be unfair. However, in the positive aspect, respecting and praising good merchants to give them spiritual comfort is very much needed. But how much respect has society shown them? The old habit of "judging people by their clothes" is still very common; and generally speaking, those who strut around in society today are still those speculative merchants who make fortunes from national disasters. This unfair phenomenon should be thoroughly reformed. (Posted on December 20, 1942)</p>

A battle of annihilation is currently underway. In this campaign, various Japanese units advanced eastward in two routes, north and south, on the evening of the 20th. On the afternoon of the 21st, they chased the Yü army to the Longwang Temple area near the bend of the old Yellow River estuary (about six kilometers from the bank of the Yellow River). Another Japanese army landed at the Yellow River estuary with a maritime mobile force, completely cutting off the Yü army's retreat. At this point, the Japanese army launched a three-pronged attack on the remnants of the New Fourth Army. Another Japanese unit, after occupying Dongkan Town (about 35 kilometers north of Funing), continued to maneuver and attack. On the morning of the 21st, they swept away the remnants of the Yü army on one hand and pursued northward on the other, forcing the New Fourth Army in that area to the old Yellow River estuary. Furthermore, the Japanese Army Air Force was also extremely active in cooperating with the ground forces, repeatedly dropping large bombs on the Yü army surrounded by the Japanese army, inflicting heavy blows.</p>

<h3>Chairman Lin's Broadcast Speech on the Second Anniversary of the Broadcasting Association</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Nanjing, 22nd: Yesterday (the 22nd) was the second anniversary of the establishment of the Chinese Broadcasting Association. Chairman Lin Baisheng gave a special speech on the Central Broadcasting Station from 8:00 PM to 8:20 PM on the 22nd. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Today is the second anniversary of the establishment of the Chinese Broadcasting Development Association. Over the past two years, thanks to the guidance of the government authorities, the assistance of friendly countries, and the common care of listeners across the country, and the concerted efforts of our colleagues in the association, the Chinese broadcasting industry has been able to establish a foundation in a very short period of time. At the same time, during this period, we have adapted to the development of the domestic and international situation, so that the broadcasting industry has made its due contribution to the promotion of the National Government's entire national policy, to the propaganda and reporting of the Greater East Asia War, and to the construction of the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. Integrating cultural undertakings with political propaganda, so that cultural workers can fulfill their due responsibilities to the country and the nation, this is originally the path of the cultural policy of a totalitarian state, and the construction of the Chinese broadcasting industry has fully proved over the past two years that we are working together on this path.</p>
<p>Looking back, the beginning of the establishment of our association coincided with the year after the National Government returned to the capital, when the East Asia League movement was actively launched following the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty and the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration. On this day two years ago, our association was formally established in Nanjing, and at the same time, the Central Radio Station was established in Nanjing, and radio stations were successively established in Shanghai, Hankou, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Ningbo. We followed the established national policy of the central government, strengthened the propaganda mechanism, and bravely moved forward with the torrent of the great era.</p>
<p>Domestically, we have focused on the Qingxiang work of the National Government, the economic revival and construction, and the New National Movement. Internationally, we have solemnly regarded the Greater East Asia War initiated by friendly countries, and the National Government's total participation in the war in January of this year, as the focus of our entire work, and have made the greatest efforts to make highly developed contributions in our own work. These are all facts that can be reviewed over the past two years.</p>
<p>Regarding the past and future work policies of our association, there are several points that must be raised for discussion with listeners across the country:</p>
<p>First, the broadcasting industry is no longer a tool for personal entertainment today. It is indeed a cultural propaganda organization that disseminates ideas, communicates public sentiment, assists education, and guides life. Especially in the current war-torn world, no country does not add the mission of ideological struggle to the broadcasting industry. Since the National Government's participation in the war on January 9th of this year, we have been formally at war with countries such as Britain and the United States. Therefore, we must further strengthen our broadcasting industry to implement the oath of total participation in the war and sharing life and death. On this point, relying solely on the independent efforts of our association is not enough, we must work closely with listeners across the country. Today, we sincerely expect listeners across the country to give us greater assistance. Second, the development of the Chinese broadcasting industry is relatively late, and the government has lacked rational management of the broadcasting stations in the past, mostly allowing them to develop freely and operate in a commercial manner. Since the establishment of our association, we have been striving to correct this tendency, on the one hand, correcting the management of radio stations, and on the other hand, cracking down on prohibited radios. We know that all countries prohibit the use of shortwave radios. This is originally a necessary measure in wartime. After our country participated in the war, we immediately began to contact the military and police authorities to crack down on prohibited radios in order to eliminate the remaining influence of Anglo-American aggressors in ideology and culture. On the active side, we are working harder to popularize wireless radio reception. Although the shortage of materials has become a common phenomenon today, we are working hard to step up the production of radios that are most suitable for the general public, so that compatriots across the country can universally receive this opportunity of spiritual food.</p>
<p>Third, regarding broadcasting programs, in order to adapt to the needs of wartime and improve the intellectual level of the people, we should minimize all decadent and pleasurable entertainment programs, and appropriately coordinate between solemn broadcasts that instill education necessary for wartime and legitimate recreational programs, in order to increase listeners' interest in broadcasting and guide life to improve. In short, within the scope of the broadcasting industry, we should fully achieve the slogan of sharing weal and woe. In order to defeat the Anglo-American aggressors and their henchmen, we must work together with friendly Japan and the axis countries in the East and West, calling on compatriots across the country to remove the individualistic and hedonistic mentality, endure hardship, be hardworking, brave, and diligent. The members of our association will do their best to work together to encourage and encourage each other. In terms of broadcasting implementation, we have decided to complete a strong-wave plan this year to make the Chinese broadcasting industry a powerful link in East Asia and internationally, intensify the ideological struggle, and complete the mission of building a new China and a new East Asia.</p>
<h3>How to Cook Brown Rice</h3>
<p>— Mrs. Miyako's Diary</p>
<p>In view of the difficulties of the current situation, 100 million Japanese people are using brown rice as their national food ration. Prime Minister Tojo's entire family took the lead in practicing eating brown rice as a model for the people in the rear. Prime Minister's eldest grandson, Masashige (three years old) - the eldest son of Prime Minister Teruo - initially suffered from poor digestion and nutrition due to Mrs. Miyako's insufficient breast milk, resulting in prolonged illness and weak physical condition. After eating brown rice, according to the appraisal report of Mr. Aikawa, Director of the Implementation Bureau of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, his development was extremely strong. Masashige's robust development is all due to Miyako's careful care after eating brown rice since February last year. The following introduces Mrs. Miyako's practice diary:</p>
<p>February</p>
<p>It has been eight months since Masashige was born. At the time of birth, breast milk was felt to be insufficient, and by the fifth month, breast milk and cow's milk were fed simultaneously. From the sixth month, due to the increase in consumption, all cow's milk was used as a substitute. However, because cow's milk was not suitable for the constitution, diarrhea began, which has lasted for three months. The body is weak, the development is poor, and the spirit is depressed. The uncle (Prime Minister Tojo) was very worried and wrote to try cooking brown rice. At this time, it was the appropriate weaning period, and with the encouragement of the uncle, brown rice feeding was started. At first, a lot of effort was spent, referring to various books on how to eat brown rice. First, the brown rice was soaked in water overnight, ground, mixed with a full cup of cow's milk, and simmered into a paste, which took about 20 minutes to cook. We were worried that undigested black brown rice hulls might flow out from the stool, but they did not. Since we started eating brown rice milk, the stubborn diarrhea disappeared in two or three days, and the stool was normal. When asked to Dr. Nikihumi Kensaburo, he said that brown rice was effective and harmless, so he felt relieved.</p>
<p>May</p>
<p>It has been three months since eating brown rice milk, and there is no discomfort, and the bowel movements are good. Recently, the complexion has improved. Recalling the pale complexion three months ago, I regret not feeding brown rice milk earlier. Because the body has gained weight and the spirit is lively, from this month, we moved from brown rice milk to brown rice porridge. Carefully observe the condition of the first two or three days. He seems to like it very much, and there is no phenomenon of harming the stomach. In fact, it can be said that he has been completely weaned. At first, the method of cooking white rice porridge was used, and it failed once. It probably requires six times more water than white rice. After the water boils, add brown rice and wait for it to boil, then take it off the heat and put it in a, especially with its swollen eyes, and then simmer over a low heat, and it will soon become porridge. It is very easy to implement when using the method of cooking twice. Since then, Masashige's stomach has become more and more normal and fatter every day.</p>
<p>August</p>
<p>Because of Masashige's condition, I had confidence, so the family started to eat brown rice. Like cooking porridge, it also needs to be cooked twice. At first, I thought that if it was cooked twice, the procedure would be complicated, the time would be long, and the fuel consumption might be high. But after getting used to it, it is easier than cooking white rice. After preparing dinner, use the idle heat to cook it once first, and then strengthen the heat and simmer it slightly the next morning, which is economical in fuel and saves the busy time in the morning, which is very helpful for us to serve the master's early departure. The adjustment of water is about twice as standard. If there is more rice, a simpler method can be used. The adjustment of water is different from that of white rice, and there is no need to consider it carefully. If there is too much water, it can be reduced during the cooking process, and if there is too little, it can be added during the process, and it will never be stiff. The uncle once wrote and said that they (the Prime Minister and his wife) have started eating brown rice since June, and the situation is good. The annoying constipation I suffered from has also been cured. The husband also likes to eat brown rice and said: It has a sweet taste when chewing.</p>
<p>October</p>
<p>Masashige could not eat rice because of illness before. Since last month, he has been eating brown rice with us. The busy husband's appetite decreases every summer, and his face is thin. This year, he is neither tired nor weak. I also overcame summer symptoms. In previous years, I was trapped in insomnia in the summer, but this year I slept very well. This is all due to eating brown rice. Ms. B, who is not used to cars and boats, suffers from motion sickness and seasickness. This time she returned to her hometown, and she did not feel dizzy when she took cars and boats back and forth on the Chita Peninsula. When I went to Tokyo a few days ago, my uncle praised him and said: "Masashige's complexion is very good."</p>
<p>November</p>
<p>It is already the cold season when the trees are withering. Last year today, Masashige, my husband and I often felt wind evil, and medicine was endless. Now, insomnia has healed suddenly, and everyone sleeps soundly until dawn. As a result, the stomach and intestines are adjusted, the nutrition is good, and they no longer like to eat side dishes with a lot of fat. Masashige is full of energy and grows fat every day. He is better developed than the children born at the same time nearby.</p>
<p>December</p>
<p>Eating brown rice has a sweet taste when chewed, so chewing naturally becomes a habit. The maid said: "Recently, the amount of food has gradually decreased." Recently, I have felt distressed due to the shortage of rice, but this will not happen again in the future. The direct motive for eating brown rice is to save rice. In this way, perhaps the goal can be achieved earlier. The uncle has also started to use brown rice as the staple food for the whole family since this month. (Xing: Class since February 10th)</p>
<h3>From March 1st, French Traffic Resumes Freedom; Boundary Between Occupied and Unoccupied Zones Abolished; German Generosity, French Great Comfort</h3>
<p>Havas Dispatch from Vichy, 22nd: French Prime Minister Laval told the press yesterday that the German authorities have decided to abolish the boundary stipulated in the Armistice Agreement from March 1st. Postal traffic throughout the country will return to normal, traffic between France and the two northern provinces will be free, and the authority to collect customs duties and examine passengers on the Franco-Belgian border will also be transferred to the French authorities. The authorities will continue to manage the old boundary lines stipulated in the Armistice Agreement. The travel permits issued by the German authorities will be invalidated from March 1st. The French people can travel freely within the country without restrictions, but Jews and undesirable elements will still be subject to restrictions when passing through the old border. Traffic between the French provinces of Calais and Nord and other places will return to normal, but the military zone in the two provinces has not yet been lifted.</p>
<p>Havas Dispatch from Paris, 22nd: After French Prime Minister Laval issued a communique announcing that the boundary between the occupied and unoccupied zones of France would be abolished, people here expressed great welcome. Political figures believe that this decision by the German occupying authorities will promote understanding between the people of Germany and France, and will also enhance the position of the French government and Laval himself. The previously isolated occupied zone of France accounts for approximately the area of ​​French territory.</p>
<p>Havas Dispatch from Vichy, 22nd: The French people expressed their appreciation for the German authorities' generosity in removing restrictions on traffic within France, because this benefits every Frenchman. After free communication between the north and south of France is permitted, the family life of the French people can be restored. This is even more important for commerce. The communication between the headquarters and branches of some companies can now proceed unimpeded. In terms of justice, the restoration of free traffic can allow cases that have been accumulating for three years to continue to be heard. Therefore, the German authorities' decision this time is.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Grains and Cooking Oil Purchase Certificates; Regularly Reissued Universally; Sugar Purchase Certificates Issued Starting Yesterday; Miscellaneous Grains Mostly Beans</h3>
<p>The planned supply of miscellaneous grains and sugar is now officially being implemented. The Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office and the Cooking Oil Trade Wholesale Office have consulted with the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, the Commodity Distribution Association for Military Yen Exchange in Central China, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, and the French Municipal Council of the French Concession on specific measures for the per capita distribution. Sugar purchase certificates for residents of the Public Concession were issued yesterday by the Shanghai Municipal Council's rice purchase certificate distribution offices as an attachment. The same is true for the French Concession. Cooking oil certificates and miscellaneous grain certificates have not yet been printed, and will not be issued until the 26th. The Datong News Agency reporter believes that this measure by the authorities has been longed for by citizens for a long time. In order to be cautious, they personally went to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Commodity Control Office and recorded the facts as follows:</p>
<p>Sugar Purchase Certificates Issued Yesterday</p>
<p>All Public Concession rice purchase certificate issuing offices began issuing sugar purchase certificates yesterday. The certificate is distributed together with the eighth batch of rice flour purchase certificates. The paper for the sugar purchase certificate is the same size as the rice purchase certificate and is light red in color. The first line on the certificate is printed with "To Retailer No. XX", and the second line is printed with "Sugar Purchase Certificate" in large font. In the center is the Shanghai Municipal Council's circular emblem. On the left end, under the "No. 1 mark", the words "Approved" are printed as a hidden mark, with each sheet as a unit.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Certificates Re-Scheduled</p>
<p>The reason why only sugar purchase certificates were issued yesterday is that the cooking oil certificates and miscellaneous grain certificates have not yet been printed and will be issued on the 26th. According to the Datong News Agency reporter, the miscellaneous grain certificates and cooking oil certificates are each in two-part form, so they are printed on eleven sheets. Their form is exactly the same as the sugar purchase certificate, except that the cooking oil certificate specifies "to purchase from Retailer No. XX", while the miscellaneous grain certificate specifies "to purchase from Retail Rice Store".</p>
<p>Same Handling at Each Office</p>
<p>There are ten rice purchase certificate issuing offices in the Public Concession and Hongkou, and their locations are as follows: (1) 234 Ma Huo Road (for taxpayers in the Central District to collect), (2) 234 Ma Huo Road (for taxpayers in the Western District to collect), (3) 110 Gordon Road (same as above), (4) 788 Seymour Road (same as above), (5) 753 Gordon Road (same as above), (6) 456 Elgin Road (for taxpayers in the Northern District to collect), (7) 130 Haining Road (same as above), (8) 80 Tongzhou Road (for taxpayers in the Eastern District to collect), (9) 29 Ward Road (same as above), (10) 558 Qiwupu Road (same as above). There are six locations in the French Concession: (1) Xiaodongmen Police Station, (2) Wooden shed in front of the Meilan Police Station, (3) 235 Avenue Joffre, (4) Yiyuan, 5) 1307 Avenue Joffre, (6) Yuandang Police Station, Route Fulu.</p>
<p>Re-Collection Dates Have Been Scheduled</p>
<p>Due to printing reasons, the miscellaneous grain certificates and cooking oil certificates could not be issued together yesterday. The Commodity Control Office has stipulated the dates for taxpayers who have collected rice flour certificates and sugar certificates to re-collect miscellaneous grain certificates and cooking oil certificates: (A) Those designated to collect rice flour certificates and sugar certificates at the Ma Huo Road Racecourse on the 22nd (yesterday) and 23rd (today) should go to re-collect miscellaneous grain certificates and cooking oil certificates on the day of March. Those who collect rice flour certificates and sugar certificates on the 24th and 25th should go to re-collect miscellaneous grain certificates and cooking oil certificates on the day of March.</p>
<p>Issued Together Starting on the 26th</p>
<p>Those designated to collect rice flour certificates and sugar certificates at issuing offices other than the Racecourse on the 22nd (yesterday) should go to re-collect miscellaneous grain certificates and cooking oil certificates on the 27th of this month. Those whose date is the 23rd should go to re-collect miscellaneous grain certificates and sugar certificates on the 6th of March. Those whose dates are the 24th and 25th should go to re-collect miscellaneous grain certificates and cooking oil certificates on the 10th of March. All taxpayers should pay attention. Starting on the 26th, they can all be issued together.</p>
<p>Issued Miscellaneous Grains May Be Beans</p>
<p>Finally, according to the Datong News Agency reporter, residents of the two concessions can collect cooking oil twice, miscellaneous grains twice, and sugar once starting in March. However, the quantity and re-purchase dates for each collection are stipulated by the Shanghai Municipal Council. According to general observation, the amount of oil and sugar is between half a catty per person per month. The miscellaneous grains are generally beans.</p>
<h3>New Method for Distributing and Selling Sugar</h3>
<p>After the sugar merchant association's business office had its "sugar rationing by population" plan approved and implemented by the military allocation authorities, it is now permitted to re-register all Category A retailers starting tomorrow, filling out a "Application for Sugar for Rationed Households" form. After review, they will be numbered and designated as shops selling sugar for rationed households. At the same time, specific measures for handling sugar for rationed households will be decided. It is reported that the Public Concession (including Hongkou) and the French Concession are also implementing sugar rationing, and the authorities have now decided to implement it soon. The following points are stipulated for Category A retailers within the two concessions:</p>
<p>Deadline for Accepting House Tax Receipts</p>
<p>(1) Shops currently selling sugar with Phase Four house tax receipts should accept those dated until March 6th for single-day receipts, and until March 7th for all-day receipts. No receipts will be accepted after these dates. (2) Each shop should stop selling sugar after the specified date. Any remaining sugar must be properly sealed and stored, pending inspection.</p>
<p>Preservation of Allocated Sugar by Each Shop</p>
<p>(3) The sugar allocated for February is for household rationing. Each shop should properly store it after receiving it, and wait for the issuance of sugar purchase permits to sell the sugar. (4) The sugar rationed for Category A retailers in the Public Concession and French Concession will be allocated by this office and the authorities according to the quantity, without the need for prior application. The application method should be abolished starting this month.</p>
<p>Zhabei and Western Shanghai to Temporarily Follow the Old Rules</p>
<p>Category A retailers in Western Shanghai and Zhabei will temporarily apply as before, still submitting house tax receipts to this office for review, and selling sugar according to the original scheduled dates. For Section A, those in the Western Shanghai area will only accept autumn house tax receipts from Western Shanghai. For Section B, those in the Zhabei area will only accept autumn house tax receipts from Zhabei. The above two areas are each limited to accepting house tax receipts from their own area, and should not mix them.</p>
<p>Nanshi to Pilot Rationing</p>
<p>Regarding the per capita rationing of sugar in the Nanshi district, according to a Shanghai News Agency reporter who inquired with the cooperation office, the registration of Category A retailers in District 7 of Nanshi has been completed. Registration certificate numbers have been assigned, and wooden signs indicating that they are selling sugar for rationed households have been issued. It has been decided to implement per capita rationing based on the baojia system starting in March, with purchases made with sugar purchase permits. The quantity and price will be the same as in the two concessions to ensure uniformity. Sugar required by various businesses (i.e., Category B users) for business needs will continue to be allocated. Regarding Category B users who have been registered and approved previously, applications for purchases starting in March should be processed from today.</p>
<h3>French Concession Water and Electricity Company Workers' Rice and Food Subsidies are Currently Being Discussed in Detail by All Parties. The Employer Agrees to Lend Wages.</h3>
<p>Workers at the French Concession Water and Electricity Company, due to the recent soaring prices of all goods and the difficulty of maintaining a livelihood, sent representatives to the company authorities to request improved treatment. Yesterday, from 1:00 PM to 3:45 PM, they temporarily stopped operations. Labor and management continued negotiations and are currently in serious discussions.</p>
<p>Last Year's Request</p>
<p>On November 19th of last year, the labor union convened a joint meeting of the board of directors and group leaders to discuss the issue of wage increases in order to address the livelihood needs of all workers and improve their treatment. It was resolved that the company authorities should be requested to increase wages by at least 50%. Labor representatives then contacted management several times. As a result, management agreed to increase wages by 10%, temporarily settling the matter. Later, at the end of last year, they requested rice and food subsidies and appealed to the French Police Department's political affairs department for assistance. Three rounds of negotiations were held between the two sides, but no results were achieved.</p>
<p>Two Meetings</p>
<p>At 10:30 AM on the 20th of this month, the Social Movement Guidance Committee appointed Guidance Committee member Wang Zhenglin as a representative to discuss labor-management coordination with the French manager and Secretary Kaimeisi (transliteration) of the French Concession Water and Electricity Company. The French second-in-command, Lataidata (transliteration), received them. At 12:00 PM on the 21st, the French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' Union also sent standing committee members Shi Quanfu and Zhang Jinqi as representatives to the company to make the same request for a wage increase for the fourth time. They were still received by the second-in-command, and no progress was made.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Situation</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, labor and management continued negotiations. Laborers temporarily stopped operations from 1:00 PM to 3:45 PM. As a result, the manager agreed to lend each person wages equivalent to twelve days in the long term. Regarding the subsidy issue, management stated that it needed to be discussed in detail by all parties. Labor, concerned about the livelihood of all workers, requested the Water and Electricity Workers' Union to discuss the issue of increasing rice subsidies. The union issued a meeting notice yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Police Department to Recover Licensed Handguns, Application for Consideration Permitted for Those with Necessary Need to Carry</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Police Department is currently planning to recover all licensed handguns. Most of the current handgun licenses were issued two or three years ago. At that time, the situation was unstable, and bandits were rampant. For safety reasons, many residents of the city obtained handgun licenses from the Police Department. Now that the baojia system has been established and crime has decreased, residents no longer need to equip themselves with handguns. Therefore, all firearms should be returned to the police authorities. After the firearms are recovered, residents who have a genuine need to equip themselves with handguns can apply for consideration and be issued new licenses.</p>
<h3>Tuition Fees Unpaid, Livelihood Precarious, Overseas Chinese Students Approved for Assistance. This Newspaper Calls Students to the Office for Detailed Investigation, and Principals of Each School to Provide Personal Certification.</h3>
<p>The scholarship office of this newspaper has repeatedly received letters from students of various schools stating that their parents reside overseas, and communication is difficult. Not only are tuition fees unpaid, but their livelihoods are also precarious, and their situation is difficult. They appeal for re-examination of their cases. The scholarship office of this newspaper has sent letters to the students to come to the office for detailed investigation, and this newspaper has asked the principals of each school to personally certify that they are indeed children of overseas Chinese merchants. The staff deeply sympathizes with these students, who have studied for many years and are about to graduate, and should be given assistance to complete their studies. The re-examination process has now been completed, and the approved list is published below.</p>

<h3>The Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association: Two Years of Work</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association has been established for over two years. It has been actively promoting the coordination and communication of cultural work between the two countries. Yesterday, a reporter visited Mr. Wang Tianmu, a permanent staff member of the association, to inquire about the recent situation of the association. He gave the following statement:</p>
<p>Academic Lectures</p>
<p>Since the official opening of this branch on April 17th, 1941, it has been warmly supported by cultural figures from both China and Japan, enabling the association's work to progress and become increasingly comprehensive. In addition to the internal organization, which has gradually become perfect, in terms of business, such as academic lectures, seven have been held. The speakers are all well-known figures from China and Japan, with profound knowledge and lively discussions. Therefore, the audience is moved, and it is of great benefit to the history of integrating the cultures of the two countries. Six academic symposiums have been held, such as those for writers, Western painters, and opera performers. The speakers are all first-class masters from China and Japan. Three art and learning conferences have been held to test the Japanese language studies of students in Chinese primary and secondary schools in this city in order to arouse their interest. Participants are very enthusiastic, and there are many listeners.</p>
<p>Communication of Culture</p>
<p>Since the purpose of this association is to communicate culture, cultural promotion is essential. In addition to publishing the "Sino-Japanese Cultural Weekly" in 1941, starting in April of last year, the association's dynamic activities have been compiled into monthly work reports and sent to the "Sino-Japanese Culture" monthly magazine published by the General Association to be published as the association's work report for publicity. To enable Japanese people to practice Southern painting and study Chinese poetry, Southern painting classes and Chinese poetry classes are held. To introduce Chinese people to practicing Japanese flower arrangement and studying Japanese prints, flower arrangement classes and printmaking classes are held. The Japanese language supplementary school has been held for four sessions. To enable Chinese youth in the concession to become proficient in Japanese, it is sponsored by the association and taught free of charge. The fourth class of students has now completed their studies and is being completed. The Chinese language research class has also been opened, and most of the people are Japanese residents in Western Shanghai, which is very convenient.</p>
<p>Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition</p>
<p>In terms of painting and calligraphy exhibitions, the Chinese painting exhibition and the Japanese painting exhibition have been held eleven times, the calligraphy exhibition has been held eight times, the Western painting exhibition has been held seven times, and the woodcut exhibition has been held three times. Most of them are carefully crafted masterpieces, so the visitors to each exhibition are very enthusiastic and have won countless praises. In order to enable the Chinese people to understand the situation of the Greater East Asia War, when the friendly countries captured famous cities such as Singapore, this branch held a photography exhibition, and the former Xingya Yuan submitted 114 photos related to the war in the Malay Peninsula for display. The audience was crowded.</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese Sports</p>
<p>Land sports such as the Sino-Japanese sports send-off meeting and the Sino-Japanese and Three-Nation Games were held to participate in the Xinjing East Asian Games. The Greater East Asia Friendship Sports Conference was participated in by this branch. The momentum was strong, and the grand occasion was unprecedented. Other sports such as table tennis have been held twice at the YMCA on Jing'an Temple Road. It is the first time that Chinese and Japanese people have competed at the YMCA, so the audience is particularly crowded. The soft tennis competition was held once in 1941. For the sake of promotion, Japanese people had friendship competitions with Chinese people who were interested in this sport by the Shanghai Soft Tennis League players to introduce it to Chinese people.</p>
<p>Film Screening</p>
<p>The films screened have been provided by twelve China Film Companies. In addition to inviting people from all walks of life to visit, two children's educational films have been screened, and a circulating news film has been screened once by the company's circulating screening team. Each time, the audience ranges from five or six hundred to more than two thousand people. Concerts have been held three times, with audiences often reaching thousands. Weiqi and Xiangqi competitions have been held three times, and the participants are all masters from China and Japan. When the Japanese Go Institute's visiting Go players arrived in Shanghai, this branch specially invited Mr. Segoshi, the 8th dan, and Mr. Wu Qingyuan, the 8th dan, to give public lectures on playing methods. They explained in detail, and the audience was very enthusiastic. On December 8, 1942, before the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, in order to arouse the Chinese people, a reward was offered for soliciting commemorative cartoons and slogans. Hundreds of people responded, and after the examination, the cartoons were given to 12 people including Huang Yifei, and the slogans were given to 16 people including Zhu Ziyong, and prizes were awarded.</p>
<p>Drama Library</p>
<p>In order to enable Chinese and Japanese drama lovers to study each other, we have collected Chinese and Japanese dramas, lyrics, and stories to establish a drama library for research. In June of last year, a Kunqu opera performance was held to entertain Japanese people, and more than 500 visitors saw the large number of people who loved Chinese drama. Since the establishment of this library, the benefits have been substantial.</p>
<p>Cordial Talks and Hospitality</p>
<p>This branch also holds various cordial talks and tea parties in order to promote friendly relations and connect feelings. Such as Mr. Hirodo Nakayama, the leading Japanese swordsman, Mr. Chūhei Nanbu, the famous Japanese athlete, Mr. Akihiumi Terukuni, the two grand sumo wrestlers, the inspection team of leading Japanese magazine companies, the Japanese news and magazine circles, the Chinese and Japanese athletes in China, Mr. Fujii, the cultural director of the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry, Japanese Western painters, and the Japanese cadres of the Western Painting Section and Drama Section of this branch. This branch sincerely entertained and banqueted them, or accompanied them to visit Peking Opera to introduce Chinese opera, or specially invited them to perform techniques for learning. Cultural exchanges will naturally benefit more. As for the undertakings that should be undertaken in the future, they are currently being gradually planned and will be promoted and implemented separately in accordance with the original plan.</p>

The Chinese and Japanese commanders arrived one after another at about 9:00 in the morning.

<p>Chairman Wang's Three Admonitions</p>
<p>The opening ceremony began at 10:00 in the morning. The auditorium was well-arranged, with a huge national flag and a portrait of Sun Yat-sen hanging in the center. After the ceremony, Naval Minister Ren Yuandao, on behalf of Chairman Wang of the Military Commission, delivered a speech, stating, "The opening ceremony of the second naval senior cadre training class is being held. I am instructed by Chairman Wang to convey his instructions." Chairman Wang's instructions included three points: (1) Love your country; (2) Love your neighbors; (3) Love East Asia together. The language is simple and concise. I hope that all students will faithfully and strictly abide by these principles. After completing the training, they must work practically and express them at any time. Since I have been serving in the Navy for three years, the consistent purpose has been to build a new navy. To investigate the responsibility and goals of building a new navy, all students should strive to promote and fully develop themselves in their respective positions, without regard to regional boundaries, unite as one, and follow the three points indicated by Chairman Wang to complete the mission of building a new navy. At this point, Jiang Xiyuan, the principal of the Naval Academy and director of the senior cadre training class, stood up to give instructions, followed by a congratulatory speech by Major General Teraoka, and a reply speech by the student representative. The ceremony was completed.</p>
<p>A Total of 20 Trainee Students</p>
<p>There are a total of 20 students in the second senior cadre training class, who are assembled from various places in China, including Naval Ministry Section Chief Xie Weiliang, Hai Xiang warship training officer Xie Gaichen, Central Naval Academy Education Director Zhang Baoying, Guangzhou Port Battalion Commander Huang Rongjian, Weihaiwei Training Camp Deputy Chief Li Zhizhong, Minhang Base Team Captain Liu Jing, Nanjing Base Team Deputy Chief Lin Kangfan, Jiangyin Base Team Deputy Chief Wei Yifu, Weihaiwei Port Adjutant Wang Jinxiu, Nanjing Port Staff Officer Yin Rusheng, Central Navy Training Center Brigade Commander Zhao Wenrong, Naval Ministry Service Wu Jixian, Naval Ministry Service Member Xu Rushen, Naval Ministry Clerk Cheng Fakan, Central Naval Academy Instructor Jiang Fengzhu, Guangzhou Training Camp Chief Instructor Wu Chaowan, Guangzhou Port Staff Officer Xu Yaozhen, Guangzhou Port Adjutant Kong Xianqiang, Guangzhou Port Staff Officer Feng Shaoping, and Central Navy Training Center Squadron Leader Zhu Bangben.</p>
<h3>Gold Ornament Price Limits Cause Business Difficulties. Goldsmiths Petitioned Yesterday, Requesting the Issuance of Future Business Standards to Facilitate Compliance and Avoid Transgressions.</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Municipal Council's Material Control Department strictly implemented the price limits on gold ornaments, Dahang and Xinhang goldsmiths have resumed price listings at the limit of 3,000 yuan per tael. The Goldsmiths' Association sent a delegation of 30 representatives, including Feng Qing'an, to petition Inagaki Noboru, the head of the Material Control Department, yesterday morning. They explained the business difficulties of the association members and stated that the price of gold ornaments is determined by the supply and demand of the "Hefa" company's market, and the association reports the market situation to the authorities for record every day. Gold ornament sales are threatened by rising prices, making sales at the limited price difficult to cover costs and making business difficult. They requested consideration of the difficulties of merchants, fair handling of the fines for the four goldsmiths, and the issuance of business standards for the goldsmith industry in the future to facilitate compliance and ensure commercial stability. It is reported that Minister Inagaki Noboru expressed great sympathy for the industry's statement and promised to consider the issues such as the gold ornament price limits.</p>

<h3>To Crack Down on Illegal Transactions by Cloth Merchants, Spot Distribution and Sale of Cotton Cloth is Implemented. The Municipal Authorities Ordered the Trade Association to Set the Maximum Price Limit and Submit the Cost and Profit for Review by the 28th.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in order to formulate the highest price limit for processed cotton cloth, specifically ordered the relevant trade associations of the city's wooden loom cloth industry, cotton cloth industry, and machine dyeing and weaving industry to submit their cases for review within a time limit. The original text says, "The highest price limit for the second phase of cotton cloth has been stipulated by this bureau and announced. However, the highest price limit for processed cotton cloth has not yet been determined. In order to obtain accurate and detailed information, this bureau requests that the association list the raw material costs, labor costs, and legal profits of various cotton cloths separately and submit them for review. The maximum price limit should be drafted by the association and submitted for review before February 28th. Please comply and follow accordingly."</p>
<p>Cloth Inventory is Very Substantial</p>
<p>A Shanghai News Agency reporter asked the person in charge of the Cotton Industry Association and various cloth trade associations about the city's cotton yarn inventory and its production status. The answer was as follows: Although there are no accurate statistics on the city's cotton yarn inventory, according to the authorities concerned, the cotton yarn stored in the city is sufficient for the needs of Central China for more than a dozen years. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the future supply. As for the production aspect, although there cannot be significant progress, each of the cotton yarn factories has gradually expanded its production scope, which will also benefit the future supply of cotton yarn.</p>
<p>Actively Seek Fair Distribution</p>
<p>The reporter also learned from another source that the above-mentioned industry associations are all aware that although the inventory is said to be substantial, and spot goods are strictly controlled by the authorities concerned, in order to stabilize the market situation, curb rising prices, and eliminate illegal transactions, they are now actively seeking to implement a distribution system in the shortest possible time to ensure fairness. At that time, all bulk spot goods required by the members of the trade association will be distributed by the trade association. Distribution groups have been set up separately to draft regulations and submit them for approval, so that they can be promoted smoothly.</p>
<p>Transportation Must Apply for Certificates</p>
<p>At the same time, the above-mentioned trade associations are all helping the authorities to eliminate illegal transactions and prevent the evil winds of large quantities of spot cotton yarn being smuggled out of the country, or manipulated and monopolized. Therefore, it has been stipulated that if an industry member intends to sell off spot goods and transport the spot goods from location A to location B, or from the warehouse to the store for sale, the goods holder must apply to the relevant trade association for a transportation permit. The certificate must specify the name of the goods, the quantity, the place of departure, the place of delivery, the name of the store, and the name of the manager.</p>
<h3>Reporter Group Tours Clear Countryside Zone - Yesterday's Departure - Shanghai Branch Various Departments - Commissioner's Representative Meets</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Clear Countryside Zone initiated the "Clear Countryside" campaign last year, six months have passed. The first phase of the "Clear Countryside" work in the Shanghai, Nanhui, Fengxian, and Northern districts is nearing completion, and the second phase is about to begin. The Shanghai branch of the Clear Countryside Committee hopes to rely on the cooperation of the people and assistance from all sides so that the security of the Clear Countryside areas can be established. In order to report on the progress and actual effects of the work, starting from yesterday (the 22nd), it invited news reporters from this city to form a tour group to visit the Clear Countryside Zone, so as to convey and report to the public. The details of the first day's reception are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Organization</p>
<p>The Shanghai Reporter Clear Countryside Zone Tour Group was established at 2:00 PM yesterday (the 22nd) at the Shanghai office of the Propaganda Department on Jiangxi Road.

<h3>Matsunaga Watch Store Robbery and Murder Case - Yu Yincai Confesses to the Crime - Police Lawyer Requests the Death Penalty - Yu Claims No Intention to Kill - Sentencing on the 27th</h3>
<p>Yu Yincai from Ningbo, on the last day of the lunar year last year, robbed 49 watches worth 55,000 yuan from the Matsunaga Watch Company, a Japanese business located at 1287 North Sichuan Road, and killed the store owner, Japanese national Matsunaga Araki, his wife Koniya, and a Chinese maid, Li Feng. The case was investigated by the Chinese detective of the Criminal Division of the Public Concession Police, and Yu was arrested. The details have been reported in this newspaper. This morning, the case was brought to trial by the Special First Court. The police representative prosecuted Yu under Article 332 of the Criminal Law for robbery and murder.</p>
<p>Drinking Strong Liquor to Fortify Courage</p>
<p>It is claimed that before committing the crime, he drank strong liquor to fortify his courage, and wore work clothes over his own clothes so that he could take them off after committing the crime to avoid attention. He also wore gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints. At the same time, he carried a biscuit tin to hold the stolen goods, and a pair of pliers in his pocket for use in the crime. The above points are sufficient to prove that Yu deliberately committed robbery and murder before committing the crime. Therefore, it is requested that he be sentenced to death according to law. As for all the stolen goods, except for the 15 pieces that Yu had already pawned, the rest were at home and have now been seized by the detectives. The pawned items have also been recovered. In addition, 500 yuan in bank notes were seized, which was the remaining amount from the pawned items. The work clothes, gloves, pliers, and biscuit tin worn during the crime were also seized.</p>
<p>Stealing Heart Arising from Gambling Debts</p>
<p>Yu Yincai confessed, "I passed by the Matsunaga Watch Company every day and often saw only a Japanese woman in the store. Because of gambling debts, I had the idea of stealing. That morning, I went to steal and entered through the back door. The store owner's wife happened to be in the toilet defecating. When she saw me, she stood up from the toilet and slowly shouted in Chinese." I was afraid of being caught, and saw a hammer nearby, so I hit her head several times until she fell to the ground. At that time, the maid was outside, opened the sliding door and entered. Seeing this, she threw a washbasin at me, so I did the same and knocked her down. Just then, the store owner came downstairs from upstairs and asked me who I was. I replied that I was there for repairs. He asked what I was repairing, but I did not answer. I hit him with the hammer. He fled upstairs, shouting "robbery." I chased him upstairs, and he fell because the mat was slippery. I then hit him twice in the head with the hammer. My arm was strong, and the hammer was made of iron. They were not made of iron, so I killed them."</p>
<p>Confusion Lead to This Disaster</p>
<p>"But my initial intention was only to steal, and I had no intention of killing. At the time, I was confused, which led to this disaster. Afterwards, I went to gambling dens in Haining, Xinzha, and Lübao, and always lost. So I pawned the watches as gambling capital. The work clothes and gloves were things I usually wore, and not specially worn temporarily for the crime." After the court verified the confession and appointed a lawyer for the defense, it announced the end of the debate and set the date for sentencing next week.</p>
<h3>As Winter Ends and Spring Arrives, Police Officers Should Step Out of Police Booths</h3>
<p>According to the Baojia authorities, the self-defense corps in the two concessions of this port have been managed quite well. However, due to the severe winter season, most self-defense corps members often stay in the police booths to avoid the northwest wind. The authorities often take this into consideration. But now that spring has arrived and the weather is getting warmer, if self-defense corps members still deliberately sit in the police booths to shirk responsibility, the authorities will issue appropriate reprimands.</p>
<h3>City Police Bureau Holds Meeting - Reports on the Significance of Clearing the Countryside</h3>

<h3>Maintaining School Buildings - Hoping Property Owners Can Understand</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>Private schools in the two concessions of Shanghai are currently facing a serious problem: some property owners have applied to the court to reclaim the rented school buildings. Therefore, various private schools have united and are conducting a campaign to maintain school buildings. This problem has been going on for quite some time, and so far, there is no solution.</p>
<p>Here, from the perspective of education, we hope that property owners in general can understand and not insist anymore. It should be known that any private school, once its school building is reclaimed, not only is it not easy to find another school building in today's situation, but even if it is found, because most of the students in each school are commuters, if the school moves far away, most students may transfer to other schools due to inconvenience of traveling back and forth. Therefore, a school with a considerable number of students, if forced too much and has to move elsewhere, the number of students will definitely decrease significantly, even to the point of not being able to maintain itself. This is the difficulty for the school itself in returning the rented school building.</p>
<p>Moreover, the seriousness of the problem is not limited to this. Nine out of ten private schools in the two concessions rent school buildings from others. If the contracts expire and the property owners insist on reclaiming them one by one, then among the seven or eight hundred schools, all the twenty or thirty thousand or more students will have nowhere to study, and the ten thousand or more teachers will be rolled into the whirlpool of unemployment, with nowhere to find food.</p>
<p>Therefore, property owners, whether for the sake of maintaining the education cause, sympathizing with the unemployment of teachers, and the problems of young people being unable to study, should not treat the rented school buildings the same as ordinary houses, and should sincerely allow the schools to continue to rent them, which is being clear about the greater good.</p>
<p>As far as we know, for general private schools, because school buildings are rented from others, the annual expenses on rent are quite large. This kind of large expenditure affects the school's equipment and teachers' salaries. The school has fulfilled its greatest obligation to the property owner, but the property owner still insists on reclaiming the school building. It seems that this can be reconsidered.</p>
<p>The authorities have repeatedly stated that they will do their best to deal with this problem and prevent it from worsening. This is indeed somewhat comforting to the education community. But on the other hand, what we earnestly hope for is that property owners who have already proposed to reclaim school buildings will not insist anymore, and those who have not had this idea will not follow in the footsteps of the former type of property owners. Everyone should consider the beneficial education cause of society, which anyone should maintain and not destroy, and put personal interests behind social welfare! Wise property owners will surely not reject these words.</p>
<h3>Minister Mei of the Ministry of Industry - Yesterday Hosted Business and Industry Leaders from Japan - Elucidating the Key Points of Wartime Economic Policy - Absorbing Materials as Much as Possible to Meet Needs</h3>
<p>Minister Mei of the Ministry of Industry held a tea party at the Cathay Hotel at 5:00 PM on the day before yesterday (the 21st). More than 130 leaders from the business and industry sectors in this port attended, clarifying the government's wartime economic policy after entering the war. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that Minister Mei and Vice Minister Yuan held another tea party at the Cathay Hotel at 5:00 PM yesterday (the 22nd), hosting major figures from the business and industry sectors of friendly nation Japan in Shanghai. The directors of the Ministry's various bureaus in Shanghai, including Xiang Xun, Sun Zuji, Chen Zhong, and Zhang Jun, were responsible for the reception. During the tea party, Minister Mei elaborated on the government's wartime economic outline. Then, Aoki Setsu, chairman of the Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of all the Japanese business guests. The party ended happily at 6:30 PM. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Guests</p>
<p>The leaders of the business and industry sectors in Shanghai included: Aoki Setsu, chairman of the Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry; Horie, standing director of the Huazhong Hydroelectric Company; Kobayashi Mamoru, standing director of the Huazhong Silk Company; Taguchi, standing director of the Huazhong Aquatic Products Company; Takeo Komuro of Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd.; Masataka Maeda of the China Tobacco Co., Ltd.; Fujine Kizuka of Mitsui Bussan Kaisha; Shinzo Ito of Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Insurance Co., Ltd.; Michio Yabe of the Continental Heavy Industries Co., Ltd.; Zenji Murakawa of the Asia Silk Industry Co., Ltd.; Toyosuke Tamaki, president of Eirei Gakuen Kogyo Co., Ltd.; Kenkichi Kawaguchi of the Sumitomo Shanghai Office; Tatsuo Oyama of Sanko Co., Ltd.; Hatsugoro Sakayori of Masumoto Yoko; Tsutomu Katsuta of Dai Nippon Boseki, and more than 60 others.</p>
<p>Speech</p>
<p>First, Minister Mei of the Ministry of Industry elaborated on the general outline of the National Government's wartime economic policy, stating: "The most important responsibility of the National Government after entering the war is to seek the revival of the domestic economy, so as to increase production and supply materials for the war. In the past five years, China's production volume of silk, cotton, etc. has greatly declined. The reason is due to the imperfections of the economic system and the poor commercial methods. In the future, we should urgently improve the economic structure, prioritize everything for the war, and absorb materials as much as possible to meet needs. Only then can victory be hoped for. As for the method of absorbing materials, those with great power among Japanese merchants should be responsible for it. Those with great power among Chinese merchants should be responsible for it. After both parties cooperate, those with great power will be responsible. There are only these three methods. I hope that the leaders of the Japanese economic community in China will work together to achieve the goal. This will not only benefit China, but also benefit Japan. I am deeply sorry for the inadequate reception today. I hope that everyone present will express their great views for the National Government's reference."</p>
<p>Response</p>
<p>Then, Aoki Setsu, chairman of the Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of all the Japanese business guests, stating: "This time, the National Government's participation in the war is a major responsibility for the victory of the Greater East Asia War, for the Chinese and Japanese people. For the victory of the Greater East Asia War, it is necessary to adjust the East Asian economic structure, increase production, and enrich materials. It is even more necessary for us, China and Japan, to cooperate fully. The Chinese and Japanese governments should be in contact politically, and the Chinese and Japanese economic circles should also work hand in hand in industry and commerce. The Japanese economic circles in China will naturally respond to the requirements of the National Government. I hope that the Chinese and Japanese economic circles will meet frequently in the future so as to work together." Finally, Mr. Kuriki of Eikai Yoko expressed his views, and the guests and hosts parted happily.</p>
<h3>Dozens of Pawnshops in Nanshi Sealed Off</h3>
<p>The City Social Bureau issued an order a long time ago requiring pawnshops within the boundary to register and obtain licenses to operate according to law. However, dozens of pawnshops in the Nanshi district disregard the law, neither fulfilling registration procedures nor obtaining licenses, which is clearly a slippery nature. The authorities notified the City Police Bureau on the 5th of this month to seal off the illegal pawnshops and further ordered the pawnshops to complete the registration procedures within a limited time. However, it is necessary to investigate whether the funds are legal. After review, dozens of pawnshops, including Dalu, Zifeng, Fuli, and Yufeng, were still illegal, so they were officially sealed off starting yesterday and are not allowed to operate. However, the pledged items must be redeemed by the borrowers within 15 days. Violators will be severely investigated.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Health Center Holds Free Smallpox Vaccination</h3>
<p>The Nanshi District Health Office of the City Health Bureau, due to the gradually warming weather, in order to actively promote smallpox vaccination and prevent the spread of smallpox, has assigned personnel to reside in the Nanshi fang offices from January 22nd to 25th, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM every day (Penglai Road in the first fang, Xiaopi Alley on Anren Street in the second fang, Minli Street in the third fang, Xinqiao Road in the fourth fang, and Pingyin Bridge West on Xietu Road in the fifth fang) waiting for citizens to receive free vaccination. In addition to notifying the fang offices to inform the Baojia chiefs and persuade residents, the office hopes that citizens will go to receive the vaccination automatically by the deadline. The office's clinic will still provide vaccinations as usual.</p>
<h3>Reduce Fees for Municipal Elementary Schools</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ping</p>
<p>Elementary school students are the future masters of the country. Therefore, the quality of elementary school education is deeply and greatly related to the rise and fall, strength and weakness of the country's future. The city government authorities, in order to popularize elementary education and benefit the poor, established many elementary schools after the incident without charging fees, for which the compatriots in the urban area are deeply grateful.</p>
<p>Students studying at municipal elementary schools initially only paid a few jiao for textbooks. Later, due to high prices, there was a slight increase. The author has three children studying in the second, third, and fourth grades of the Zhexing Elementary School. Unexpectedly, at the beginning of this semester, each of them received three volumes of national elementary school textbooks, Chinese, Common Sense, and Arithmetic, totaling no more than three yuan, but the textbook fee to be paid jumped to as much as thirty yuan per person, without distinguishing levels or providing receipts. It was then learned that the tuition paid by neighboring children studying at the Hongzhen Elementary School, which is also municipal, was different, namely seventeen yuan for the first grade, nineteen yuan for the second grade, twenty-two yuan for the third grade, and twenty-four yuan for the fourth grade, with receipts given as proof. I think that it is not surprising that private schools may have more fees. The increase in textbook fees for municipal elementary schools must have other reasons. However, from the standpoint of most poor children, these dozens of yuan in textbook fees are still an unbearable burden. If there are more children, they will inevitably drop out of school as a result, which would be contrary to the original purpose of popularizing education. Recently, I saw in the newspaper that Mayor Chen had donated a large sum of money to create a loan fund for poor students, so I deeply hope that the wise education authorities can also implement the following points in the spirit of the mayor's love for students, which will benefit the young people immensely!</p>
<p>(1) Consider reducing textbook fees, and it is best to pay the actual price.</p>
<p>(2) Issue a notice to all affiliated elementary schools to charge the same fees to avoid differences, and issue receipts when collecting fees as evidence.</p>
<p>(3) If a brother or sister has already read a book, and it can still be used as a textbook for younger siblings, allow it to be reused and exempt the purchase of a new book to save materials.</p>
<h3>Special Compilation on Various Places in Nanyang, Part 3: The Philippines, Past and Present (5)</h3>
<p>— Voter</p>
<p>The Japanese military implemented a "local self-sufficiency" policy for military, government, and finance in the Philippines, which meant obtaining supplies locally. In addition to the existing special account for temporary military expenses, a special "military government account" was established, encompassing all accounting related to military and government affairs. The accounting for the military government supervisory department was handled separately according to a special account. The budget of the Philippine Executive Commission was also included in the military government account as a type of special account. The financial resources for the military government account came from revising existing laws and regulations, exporting materials, levying new taxes in a manner similar to tariffs, and supplementing any shortfall by taxing the profits of military-managed factories in the form of payments to the Japanese military. Therefore, these two major sources of revenue allowed the military government finance to become completely independent from the special account for temporary military expenses.</p>
<p>In the financial sector, the Philippine peso, which had always been supported by the US dollar, faced the danger of collapse due to the severance of its relationship with the dollar. Therefore, the peso was implemented at par with military scrip to maintain its value and facilitate its common circulation, thereby integrating the old and new currencies. As for local financial institutions, the seven enemy banks in Manila were reorganized and liquidated to eliminate Anglo-American influence. The three Japanese-affiliated banks and four Philippine-affiliated banks have resumed operations. Since July, the Southern Development Gold Vault Philippine branch has opened, and together with the aforementioned banks, it provides loans and absorbs floating capital for various development-related enterprises. The financial situation, which was chaotic after the war, has now stabilized.</p>
<p>In the economic sphere, the national economy of the Philippines is entirely based on agriculture, with 80% of agricultural exports going to the United States. This completely US-dependent economic structure is the most difficult undertaking within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and is currently being improved with the cooperation of the Japanese military authorities and the military government supervisory department. The key point of economic construction is to provide Japan with the resources necessary to sustain the war effort. The priority is to obtain and continue mining mineral resources, and to promote the cultivation of cotton, ramie, and other crops. In the mining sector, the focus is shifting from gold mining to copper and manganese mining. The extraction of copper, manganese, chromium, iron, and other minerals has already begun, and efforts are being made to restore other mining operations. At the same time, a portion of sugarcane fields has been converted to cotton cultivation. By the end of October, 60% of the arable land in Luzon had begun planting cotton, followed by Manila hemp planting on Mindanao Island. In addition, the coconut and Manila hemp industries continue production to meet the needs of mainland Japan and the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Furthermore, to ensure food security, a food production increase movement was launched at the beginning of last year, implementing the cultivation of idle land, importing improved varieties of Japanese rice, and increasing the production of alternative food crops.</p>
<p>In order to adjust the supply and demand of materials in the Philippines, materials are produced in a planned manner while various distribution departments are controlled. The Philippine Essential Commodities Distribution Control Association, the military-managed Rice Grain Company, the Liquid Fuel Distribution Control Association, the Food Control Association, and other organizations were established. Various control mechanisms for the distribution of essential commodities have been established for each major material. A voucher system and rationing system are implemented in a planned manner for rice and other foodstuffs, matches, clothing, soap, daily necessities, and various major materials, with appropriate prices set and under the strict supervision of the Japanese military. In the development, collection, and transportation of materials, the Mining Field Council, Cotton Cultivation Association, Coconut Purchasing Cooperative, and Timber Control Association were successively organized as designated agencies of the Japanese military. They exclude intermediary buyers and directly purchase all materials from producers, delivering them to the Philippine Import and Export Materials Processing Association, which then exports them to mainland Japan and other areas within the Co-Prosperity Sphere through the hands of the Japanese military.</p>
<p>In terms of transportation, land transportation has rejected the past focus on automobiles and adopted a railway-based approach. At the same time, shipping is used on rivers and along the coast to enhance the effectiveness of resource extraction. The most important aspect of communication within the Philippine archipelago is maritime transport. The main focus is on mobilizing all loading and unloading cargo ships and small-scale civilian motorized sailboats, and utilizing abundant timber resources to build a large number of wooden ships locally.</p>
<p>In cultural affairs, emphasis is placed on (1) purging American culture, (2) promoting understanding of Japanese culture to create culture in East Asia, and (3) reviving the inherent culture of the Philippines. Concrete measures are being implemented under the leadership of the military press department, and the New Philippines Music Association, the New Philippines Art Association, and other organizations have been established. Cultural work in the Philippines is now directly guided and supervised by the military press department, which controls newspapers, radio broadcasts, movies, magazines, and music departments. Cultural institutions, which were almost closed at the time of the occupation, are gradually being revived. Currently, in the newspaper sector, only the English-language *Tribune*, the Spanish-language *La Vanguardia*, and the Japanese-language *Manila Daily News* and English-language *Sunday News*, operated by Japanese, are permitted. However, military propaganda units are widely promoting wall newspapers and other movements, developing new East Asian news businesses. In radio broadcasting, the Japanese military took over KZRH radio station, using it as a key platform for popular education, enlightenment, and propaganda. In the film industry, a new central distribution organization was established to stabilize public sentiment. Eight major movie theaters in Manila were opened as early as February 1 of last year, and other local movie theaters were also opened successively. Past American films are reviewed by the military press department, and Philippine newsreels and Japanese newsreels made by the military press department are provided. In addition, theatrical performances and music are performed in movie theaters to supplement the shortage of films.</p>
<p>In education, a new educational policy was announced, with key points including strengthening Japanese-Philippine friendship, eliminating Euro-American dependent thinking, rejecting materialism, cultivating loyalty, popularizing Japanese, abolishing English, popularizing elementary education, promoting vocational education, and advocating a spirit of hard work. The order of school restoration is from elementary to higher education, from public to private schools, and from vocational to general education. Currently, there are 400 public schools reopened or planned to reopen, with 50,416 students, and 280 private schools, with 22,000 students. They are generally kindergartens, elementary schools, and higher elementary schools, with middle schools in preparation. In order to build the Philippine economy, special attention is given to vocational education, and public agricultural schools have resumed classes. Middle schools also place emphasis on vocational education. The most distinctive feature of education is the implementation of Japanese language education, realizing the "public use of Japanese."</p>
<p>The Philippine National Movement</p>
<p>The last fifty years of Spanish rule in the Philippines, from 1850 to 1900 AD, was the "era of progress and revolution" in the Philippines, and also the founding era of the Philippine national independence movement. With the victory of the European Industrial Revolution, the ideas of liberalism, humanism, and all progressive ideas swept across the Pacific Ocean, and the Philippines also bathed in this European and American wind and rain. Britain's activities in Asia in 1834, and the opening of the port of Manila, became a major opportunity for the development of Philippine industry, prompting the emergence and development of a new bourgeoisie centered on landlords and commercial capitalists. Thus, against the declining feudal rule of Spain, revolutionary rebellions were continuously promoted, gloriously writing the early history of the national independence movement. If this national movement had succeeded at that time, then the political, economic, and cultural landscape of the Philippines would have certainly been different. However, as a result of the Spanish-American War, the political power of the Philippines passed from the Spanish to the hands of American imperialism. Here, there is also a shameful history of $20 million "golden bullets," a painful history of betrayal and deception by leaders of the national movement, and especially a bloody history of American imperialism's buying off, dividing, and bloody armed suppression of the Philippine national movement. The Philippine national movement failed again under the deception and armed suppression of American aggressors' false "independence." The United States deliberately delayed the realization of "independence" while intensifying the process of Philippine economic dependence on the United States. Here, the degeneration of the Philippine ruling class, the betrayal of national leaders, and the treachery of American imperialists were all executioners of the Philippine national liberation movement.</p>
<p>However, that is the past. Now, the Philippines has arrived at a new era, an era of self-reliance and self-rescue. Because in the past, the Philippine economy was visibly and invisibly dominated by the United States, to the point of being unable to stand on its own. Everything relied on the United States. Once the relationship with the United States, upon which it relied, was severed, once the chains of the United States were broken, temporary chaos was an inevitable phenomenon. The question now facing the people of the Philippines and the overseas Chinese, who are long-time friends and co-residents of the Philippines, is how to recognize their own completely liberated future in this chaos, persevere in their struggle, and serve as a model of the first liberated nation in East Asia!</p>

<h3>French Concession Police Criminal Division Solve Old Case</h3>
<p>On April 12th of the 28th year of the Republic of China, at around 10:00 PM, Chinese policeman No. 340 stationed at the intersection of Route Foch and Route Coubert was shot and killed by bandits. Several years have passed, and the murderer is still at large. On the evening of the 20th, at around 7:00 PM, Inspector Guan Baoquan of the Criminal Division of the French Concession Police received a tip that the perpetrator of this case was hiding at No. 31, Lane 240, Route Paul Henry. He led Inspectors Qin Youyu, Detective Weng Huanzhang, Zhang Dongcheng, and Xiao Pei to the address. Near the intersection of Route Dufour, the suspect came face to face. They arrested him and took him to the police station. According to his confession, his name is Yan Songnan, 20 years old, from Shaoxing. At the time, after robbing the policeman's official handgun, he planned to rob elsewhere. Unexpectedly, the policeman resisted, so he preemptively fired three shots, hitting vital points and killing him. He also said that there were two accomplices involved in the robbery. The French Concession Police are currently searching for the escaped accomplices to bring them to justice.</p>

The association has long followed the instructions of the authorities to announce the handling of the matter. Currently, the number of applicants registered with the association has been very enthusiastic. Now, due to the need to organize the procedures, registration is temporarily closed. Once the various procedures are completed, a decision will be made on whether to reopen.</p>

<h3>Western Association Soccer Second Round Robin, Friendship Meets Righteous Navy on Saturday, Donghua Replays Portuguese Merchants on Sunday, First Round Saints Francis Beat Portuguese Merchants in Group A</h3>
<p>The Western Association soccer schedule for this week was announced yesterday by the association's secretariat. On Saturday (the 27th), four Group A second-round matches will be held. Friendship will meet Righteous Navy for the second time. The two teams met in the first round at Jiaozhou Park at 3:45 PM. The Righteous Navy took a two-goal lead, but Friendship managed to tie the game 2-2 in the last minute. In the Scatto Cup preliminary round, Friendship won a penalty kick opportunity and eliminated the Righteous Navy 1-0. Therefore, the strengths of the two sides are comparable. However, Friendship has recently lost Wu Qixiang and Zheng Yingquan is injured. The central defender and forward lines are feeling the lack of manpower, and the lineup is relatively weak. The Righteous Navy's skills have also declined. Except for McNitty, Villadi and Banna on the wings are no longer as fierce as before. The new central defender Stephen is weak and incompetent, and defender Rossier is not as active as he once was. Therefore, it is difficult to predict who will win. On the same day, there will be three matches in the Group B division. On Sunday (the 28th), Group A second round, Donghua will replay Portuguese Merchants, with the match at Jiaozhou Park at 3:45 PM. The two teams tied 1-1 in the first round, but the Portuguese Merchants' lineup is not very good. Although veteran Victor sits in the back, Oliveira guards the midfield, and Gain V. Suo and others serve as forwards, the whole team is still slightly inferior to Donghua. Moreover, Donghua performed exceptionally well in the match against Righteous Navy last week, so their chances of winning are very high. On the same day, there will be four matches, all belonging to the Group B and C divisions. The day before yesterday (the 21st), in the last match of the Group A first round, Portuguese Merchants defeated Saints Francis 3-1. In the Group, Anhua defeated the beginner's association 4-2. According to the announcement of the Western Association secretariat, the Sino-Portuguese charitable match organized by the association has been postponed repeatedly due to rain. The date of the match is yet to be decided. Those who have pre-purchased tickets for the match and wish to refund them can go to the Western Association branch office on the second floor, No. 3 Yong'an Street, from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM daily to refund the money with the tickets. The schedule for this week is recorded below.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the newspaper's broadcast time was 7:10 PM.</p>
<h3>To Promote Farmers' Production, Soybean Cake is Controlled and Purchased</h3>
<p>Recently, the authorities, in order to stabilize the people's livelihood, have decided to control various commodity prices, especially for food. Rice, flour, oil, sugar, and other items have already been implemented with a per capita allocation system, which is progressing smoothly. Although miscellaneous grains and beans have been allocated, it is still difficult to achieve universal coverage. Improvements will be made soon. There are also large quantities of soybean cakes stored in Shanghai, which are affected by hoarders raising prices too high. Farmers are unable to afford to purchase them in Shanghai, which has a significant impact on agricultural production. Therefore, the authorities believe that it is necessary to pay attention to this issue. They have planned to purchase and allocate soybean cakes to reduce the cost of agricultural products and benefit the promotion of increased production.</p>
<h3>Central University Adds Special Lectures</h3>
<p>Professor Chen Renhe, in addition to his political duties, does not neglect writing and especially enjoys studying Japanese history, with many unique insights. Nanjing Central University has invited Chen to teach a special lecture on Japanese history at the school, scheduled to begin in mid-May. It is said that the content will temporarily focus on the late shogunate period up to the Meiji Restoration to the present. Many specialized books have already been written on this topic, and many people are already familiar with it, so Chen will not cover that period.</p>

<h3>To be Cautious, the Silver Union Association Formulates a Bill Review Method to Prevent Forgery and Eliminate Malpractices</h3>
<p>The Bankers' Joint Reserve Association has formulated a bill review method to be cautious and eliminate malpractices. It stipulates that all checks issued by its members to the Association, after being paid by the Association, must be sent to the issuing banks before the start of business hours the next day. Upon receiving the returned payment checks from the Association, each bank should immediately conduct a detailed review. If any forgery is discovered, the Association should be notified promptly for the return of the original receiving bank. The deadline for sending returned bills to the Association is 12:00 noon. Late submissions will not be accepted. If any disputes arise as a result, they should be resolved directly between the issuing bank and the receiving bank, and the Association will not be responsible. At the same time, it stipulates: (1) In the future, all transfer requests for the Association's checks issued by each bank should be signed and sealed by two staff members. (2) Each bank should designate important staff members to manage the storage of blank Association checks.</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Promoting the Exchange of Internal Goods</h3>
<p>The recent wartime economic policy guidelines announced by the National Government pay special attention to increasing production, especially ensuring the most convenient supply of industrial raw materials and fuel. Under an appropriate pricing policy, the income of agricultural and industrial producers should be guaranteed to encourage their reproduction. Especially for the purchase of agricultural products, special attention should be paid to the reproduction of farmers and the exchange of agricultural products and daily industrial products. This policy is indeed the only lifeline for China's economic recovery. The past obstruction of internal and external goods and the stagnation of transportation mechanisms have already made agricultural and industrial livelihoods increasingly difficult and affected the wealth of the country and the people. This is a major hidden danger in the Chinese economy.</p>
<p>If we want to save this crisis, we can only start by promoting the exchange of internal and external goods, making sure that each province and province, county and county, city A and city B, all implement the method of "exchanging what they have for what they lack." Make their trade flexible, their exchanges swift, and break down any and all difficulties to promote unified national production as the goal. This is the only path for China's economic policy in the future. The three principles of commodity control recently proposed by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to the authorities are: (1) Control should not tend to be uniform. It should be reasonably controlled according to the different levels of importance and urgency of various commodities. (2) The commodity control between Shanghai and other places has now fallen into an abnormal state, resulting in huge price differences in various places, and the exchange of goods in each region is also greatly hindered. In the future, the control of commodity exchange between Shanghai and other places must pay attention to balance and harmony. (3) It is hoped that official control will be reduced, and autonomous control will be promoted. The so-called autonomous control should make full use of the existing trade associations and strengthen them. As for the cooperation between Chinese and Japanese businessmen, it should also maintain the balance of each other's economic capabilities so that the drawbacks of monopoly do not arise. This is a great contribution to promoting the exchange of internal and external goods. If this can be done, then the raw materials that Shanghai manufacturers desire and the daily necessities that people in the interior urgently need can be easily resolved, and each can get what they need. All wise authorities will be happy to accept and willing to implement this in order to revive this dying people's livelihood. On the 15th of this month, Zhuang Taro Ishiwata, the economic advisor most relied on by the National Government, passed through Shanghai and made a statement saying: "The National Government is working hard to increase production as a policy within its capabilities. It is currently planning to use materials produced in the interior as raw materials to revive the Shanghai factories that have been suspended to promote the exchange of goods between Shanghai and the interior. At the same time, it will also promote the exchange of goods between North China and Central China." He said. Supply as much as possible the raw materials of agricultural products from various places for the production of various factories, and at the same time supply as much as possible the daily necessities of the factories' machine-made products to the rural areas of various places. This will not only smooth the goods in various places, but also facilitate the economy at home and abroad. If this can be done, even the factories in Shanghai that have suspended or reduced production will have the opportunity to continue to emit smoke because the raw materials are available. Since production is fast, there will be more goods. At this point, even if we don't talk about suppressing prices, prices will naturally be able to fall.</p>
<h3>Most Silk Factories in Various Places Have Changed Their Business</h3>
<p>According to a recent survey by the local inspection team of the China Central Silk Company, most of the original small-scale silk factories in the silk-producing areas of Central China have recently changed their business or closed down. Most of the companies that have changed their business have moved their original silk-making equipment to local cities and changed to other industries. The future of the silk industry will become even bleaker, which can also be seen from this.</p>
<h3>The Rising Prices of Daily Necessities and Countermeasures</h3>
<p>— Ren Yuan</p>
<p>The rising prices of daily necessities have become an unstoppable trend recently. Since the implementation of rationed food distribution in Shanghai, rice prices have been adjusted to a level that allows people to sustain their livelihoods. Although the demand for daily necessities such as matches and soap is not as large as that for rice, they are essential items that people cannot live without. Frequent price increases affect personal and household budgets, as well as hygiene and other aspects. For example, the high price of soap makes it common for people to live with dirt and fleas. Therefore, although daily necessities are small and scattered items, their importance is no less than that of rice. The whole society pays great attention to fluctuations in rice prices, but often overlooks the prices of daily necessities, which is a major mistake.</p>
<p>The soaring prices of daily necessities can be seen in the figures. On January 15th of the 31st year of the Republic (1942), the market prices were: Beauty brand matches 1,700 yuan, Gu Ben soap 88 yuan, and Price's candles 68 yuan (all old currency). Unexpectedly, in just one year, match prices tripled, soap prices increased twelvefold, and candle prices increased thirteenfold. According to the current situation, candle prices seem to have entered a plateau, but the rising prices of matches and soap are still endless. The following table shows the magnitude of the fluctuations:</p>
<p>According to economic principles, the relationship between supply and demand determines prices. Currently, we are in a time of war, and the difficulty in sourcing raw materials and the depletion of inventories are undeniable facts. These facts are factors that reduce supply. However, on the demand side, the concentration of people and the prevalence of hoarding have led to a large increase in demand. Those who can indirectly influence the relationship between supply and demand are speculators.</p>
<p>Speculators and normal consumers have two different mentalities. The former's goal in hoarding is usually higher quality and older brand products, while the latter, due to gradually weakening purchasing power, have to settle for second best. Therefore, if there were no speculators meddling, "older goods" would definitely sell better than "high-end goods." Looking at the rising prices of daily necessities, candles have stable prices because Shanghai is not their main market, while the price increases for "high-end" soaps and matches are far more severe than for "lower-end" products. In the daily necessities market, speculators are stirring up trouble and grabbing as much as they can, which is very obvious.</p>
<p>To curb the rising prices of daily necessities, the fundamental solution is naturally to find ways to increase production and facilitate transportation. This is a technical issue and not within the scope of this article. This article proposes several stopgap measures, some of which the municipal authorities have already implemented but with little effect, and others that they are planning to implement but with many problems. This allows speculators to seize the opportunity of "the infinitely beautiful sunset" and cause a crazy rise in the prices of daily necessities.</p>
<p>Countermeasures to the crazy rise in the prices of daily necessities are:</p>
<p>1. Price controls: Price controls are a common method to suppress prices, but their effectiveness is also the least significant. The first difficulty is the difficulty in determining the price limit. Setting it too high defeats the original intention of price control, and setting it too low reduces merchants' profits and easily creates a situation of "having a price but no goods." The second difficulty is the difficulty in enforcement because the demand is not consistent, inevitably leading to the emergence of black markets and "backdoor deals." Consumers often prefer to negotiate with stores in the black market because there are no goods to buy. In this way, price controls are naturally broken. According to a report on January 11th, Wuzhou Gu Ben Factory and others set the price limit for Gu Ben soap at 80 qian per bar of military currency, and Huang Xiangmao at 73 qian per bar. Although the manufacturers allocate to retailers at this price, it is more difficult for consumers to buy at the price limit than to climb to heaven. One reason for this is that the allocation is not enough to sell, and the other is the exploitation by middlemen, namely wholesalers and retailers. A month ago, the cigarette and paper shops in the French Concession stopped selling cigarettes because the profit from selling cigarettes at the limited price was not high, and the authorities' enforcement was too strict. As a result, they secretly transported the rationed cigarettes to the Public Concession and sold them on the black market. This shows that whether price controls are not strict or too strict, they are difficult to achieve significant results.</p>
<p>2. Inspecting inventories and cracking down on speculation: Inspecting inventories includes not only the automatic registration of goods by the holders but also restrictions on transportation. In terms of the relationship between supply and demand, this is a relatively good method. However, whether the application for registration is accurate and whether the inventory inspection is thorough are all issues that need to be discussed. Restrictions on transportation are often undermined by merchants' deception and trickery because a complete ban on transportation is impossible. The limited quantity that is set allows merchants to disassemble entire boxes and packages of goods, or change their appearance to make it difficult for inspectors to identify them, or even collude with inspectors to smuggle large quantities of goods in a certain period. As for cracking down on speculation, the authorities have also implemented various methods, such as arresting speculators, monitoring buying and selling in the market, and closing the market. However, it is difficult to catch all speculators in one fell swoop. In the market, monitors cannot keep an eye on everything. Closing the market allows speculators to conduct "guerrilla-style" buying and selling on the streets. Therefore, these methods can only be effective for a short time, and a long-term solution requires serious consideration.</p>
<p>3. Rationing: Rationing is the best way to eliminate exploitation by middlemen and stabilize prices. According to a report on February 16th, in order to suppress prices, the authorities decided to implement a rationing system for daily necessities such as soap, matches, and candles. If this news is realized, the rising prices of daily necessities will naturally be curbed. (Before it is realized, just the news alone caused the prices of various matches to fall by hundreds of yuan in one day, which shows that rationing is a fatal blow to speculators.)</p>
<p>However, rationing daily necessities is not without problems. First, what are the production and inventory levels of daily necessities? If the allocated quantity is too large, will production and sales correspond? If it is too small, citizens will not have enough to use, and they will inevitably search and purchase everywhere, making it difficult to eliminate the black market. Second, although daily necessities are as essential to citizens as rice, the quantity required is elastic, unlike the fixed amount of rice. After the implementation of the rationing system, citizens, regardless of class or wealth, will have ration coupons. Poor citizens do not need much and, considering the social need, will inevitably sell their coupons at high prices in order to increase their income. If this is the case, the hygiene of the poor will continue to deteriorate, and illegal phenomena in transactions will still be difficult to completely eliminate. After the implementation of the rationing system, the rising prices of daily necessities can be curbed, but to achieve rational allocation, it cannot be done hastily.</p>
<p>The municipal authorities have already considered the above-mentioned issues, and we hope that people at home and abroad will discuss them together.</p>
<h3>Thriving Business in Wool Fabric Retail Shops</h3>
<p>Due to various environmental factors, the wholesale market price of wool fabric is quite high, and transactions are rare. However, the retail business in shops is extremely prosperous. In general wool fabric shops on Tao Pan Street, daily retail sales mostly reach 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, or even 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. The sales of various distributors can also reach 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, or even 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Some people, hearing that prices will rise soon, are rushing to buy clothing materials. The sales of Chinese and Western-style men's and women's wool fabrics have suddenly become prosperous, a situation similar to that during the previous major price reduction. However, shop owners show signs of unease because the more they cut and sell, the greater the sacrifice.</p>
<h3>Explanation of the Outline of Wartime Economic Policy</h3>
<p>— Yi Ren</p>
<p>— A The Times Article Yesterday —</p>
<p>Yesterday (February 22nd), The Times published an article that succinctly elaborated on the Outline of Wartime Economic Policy passed by the Supreme National Defense Council on February 13th of this year and provided ideal annotations. The clauses listed and annotated in the article are the author's perception of the key points in the Outline of Wartime Economic Policy. For the convenience of readers' reference, each clause in the translation is annotated in parentheses to indicate which article and clause of the Outline of Wartime Economic Policy it belongs to.</p>
<p>In order to establish the foundation of the wartime economy, the National Government has specifically formulated the Outline of Wartime Economic Policy, which includes everything related to increasing production, regulating prices, conserving consumption, and reorganizing the entire economic structure. We must have a full understanding of this blueprint for economic policy. Therefore, we have selected the key points in the Outline of Wartime Economic Policy and annotated them as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Increasing agricultural production is to increase all essential wartime materials, such as rice, cotton, oil-producing seeds, poultry, eggs, and all livestock such as pigs, cattle, and sheep. Technical aspects, in particular, must be improved. (See Article 1 (A) of the Outline of Wartime Economic Policy)</p>
<p>(2) Developing mineral resources is a necessary condition for supplying military needs. All kinds of coal, iron, copper, and tin should be exploited as much as possible. If further technical assistance is provided by Japan, the effect will be significant. (See Article 1 (B) of the Outline of Wartime Economic Policy)</p>
<p>(3) Guaranteeing the income of agricultural and industrial producers is the most delicate and important issue. The way to guarantee this is to adopt a fair price policy to ensure their income. If the price paid to producers is too low, the producers will only store their products in the largest possible quantities and sell them at the highest possible prices. (See Article 1 (D) of the Outline of Wartime Economic Policy)</p>
<p>(4) Improving the transportation mechanism must focus on improving the distribution of materials. In addition to railways and inland river transportation, attention must also be paid to maritime transportation. Wooden boats are very important in increasing transportation efficiency. As for the black market freight rates in the transportation industry, they must be completely eradicated—this is a very difficult task. (See Article 1 (E) of the Outline of Wartime Economic Policy)</p>
<p>(5) Regulating various prices naturally depends on cracking down on speculation and hoarding, and eliminating improper profits for those in between. It should be known that those in between also have their own responsibilities, namely the packing and transportation of goods. If there are no intermediaries between producers and consumers, the government must particularly increase the effectiveness of distributing goods. (See Article 2, D of the Outline of Wartime Economic Policy)</p>
<p>(6) In terms of conserving consumption, the most attention should be paid to the waste of all materials. The use of all luxury goods and luxuries must be restricted. If consumers' needs conflict with wartime industry, they should be supplied with other substitute goods. (See Article 3 (B) of the Outline of Wartime Economic Policy)</p>
<p>(7) In terms of regulating rural finance, it is most necessary to find ways to channel funds into rural areas, and rural credit loan institutions can be restored accordingly. In addition, the adjustment of the income tax system is also a way to improve national revenue. As for encouraging people to save, it is a good way to regulate finance, but only after the currency system has been stable for a long time will people be willing to save. Otherwise, people's psychology will always regard goods as more important than money. (See Article 4 (C) and (E) of the Outline of Wartime Economic Policy)</p>

<h3>Points to Note for the Establishment of a Limited Company (4)</h3>
<p>B. The Practicalities of Establishing a Company</p>
<p>I. Founders' Meeting or Preparatory Meeting A limited company must have at least seven founders. According to current practice, founders' meetings or preparatory meetings are often held (although not required by law). The tasks of this meeting usually include: (1) Deciding on the company name and total share capital, (2) Drafting the prospectus, (3) Appointing preparatory personnel and institutions for collecting share subscriptions, and (4) Deciding on the address of the preparatory office. There are no regulations regarding the amount of capital in the Company Law; however, the minimum amount for banks, money houses, insurance companies, and trust companies is 500,000 yuan; there is no fixed amount for enterprise companies, industrial companies, and factories. According to Article 111 of the Company Law, the amount of each share "shall not be less than twenty yuan; but if it is fully paid in one lump sum, it may be ten yuan per share." The number of directors shall be at least five, and the number of supervisors shall be at least one. The company's prospectus should be simple and clear and different from the company's articles of association. It does not need to be too detailed or lengthy. Article 88 of the Company Law stipulates that the following items should be stated, signed, and sealed: 1. (1) Company name, (2) Business scope, (3) Total number of shares and the amount of each share, (4) Head office, branch offices, and their locations, (5) Method of announcement, (6) Qualifications for the election of directors or supervisors, (7) Names and addresses of the founders, etc. At the beginning of the prospectus, there is often a section titled "Origin," which explains the motivation and business goals of the founding company. Some even include the figures of the operating budget, listing the operating income, operating expenses, and methods of capital use separately to arouse investors' interest. 2. Work during the Preparatory Period The main preparatory work is as follows: (1) Applying to the competent authorities for registration in accordance with Article 23 of the Company Law Enforcement Regulations: The application should be accompanied by: 1. Business plan, 2. Roster of founders' names, experiences, and share subscription numbers, 3. Prospectus, signed by all founders. After receiving the approval, share subscriptions can begin; however, if the founders subscribe for the total amount of shares, the third item may be exempted. (2) Printing prospectuses, subscription forms, and share payment receipts. (3) Connecting with the share subscription collection agency.</p>
<p>Article 114 of the Company Law stipulates: "A company may not issue shares unless it is registered for establishment." Therefore, when share payments are received during the preparatory period, only share payment receipts can be issued, and formal shares will be exchanged for the share payment receipts in the future. However, when a stable bank collects share payments for a newly established company, it often establishes a separate account for collecting share payments. Only after the newly established company has recovered the share payment receipts and submitted them to the bank can the entire amount of share payments be transferred to the newly established company's current account for withdrawal by the company. From the bank's perspective, this step is to reduce its own responsibility to the share subscribers and protect the rights of the share subscribers. It cannot be said that there is no reason. However, it often takes several months from the receipt of share payments to the issuance of formal shares. During this period, the company inevitably needs funds, but the bank temporarily does not allow the withdrawal of share subscriptions, which is quite inconvenient. To remedy this difficulty, the share subscription collection agency can be requested to issue temporary receipts when collecting share payments, and then the share subscribers can take the temporary receipts to the new company's preparatory office to exchange for share payment receipts. In this way, after the share payments are received, the company can return the temporary receipts issued by the bank to the bank, and the bank will transfer the share payments of the returned receipts to the company's deposit account for its use. This method is clear, and all parties can be taken care of, but the procedures are more complicated.</p>
<h3>An Overview of European Stock Markets</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 21st: Last week, the Berlin stock market was stable, with some stocks slightly rising. The Dutch stock market was weak, with few buyers. There were many buyers in Brussels, but stocks were difficult to obtain. The Paris market fluctuated violently, but trended downwards towards the weekend. The Swedish stock market was particularly volatile at the beginning of the week, but trading was strong towards the weekend, and the situation tended to stabilize.</p>
<h3>Chicago Housewives Spend Millions of Dollars Weekly in the Black Market</h3>
<p>Lisbon, February 21st: The housewives of Chicago, USA, spend approximately one million US dollars in the black market every week. As a result, the US government authorities are extremely surprised at the rampant black market activities throughout the country. Black market activities are particularly intense in larger US cities. For example, in Pittsburgh, only three pounds out of every ten pounds of meat can be purchased from official slaughterhouses. This situation is particularly serious in industrial centers throughout the United States, so much so that government authorities in charge of rationing are overwhelmed. According to the same day's Lisbon telegram, a "Rationing Committee" has been established in Washington to specialize in the distribution of food. The announcement of the establishment of the committee stated that the domestic need for food is increasing daily, while the supply of food is decreasing, so it is necessary to weigh the circumstances when people apply to determine the rationing standards. In any case, the control of food must be more stringent from now on.</p>
<h3>Improving Cotton Industry in Central China: Increasing the Planting of Superior Seeds</h3>
<p>The Central China Cotton Production Improvement Association has decided to expand the existing seed farms this year in order to ensure superior cotton seeds. At the same time, seed farms will be added in the main cotton-producing areas where security has been restored, and superior cotton seeds will be planted to improve the cotton seeds in Central China (Continental News, February 22nd).</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Notes Firm, Allied Notes Down Another Five Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Shanghai Money Dealers Association quoted an interbank interest rate of 18%, unchanged.</p>
<p>Japanese military notes trended slightly firmer, with interbank trading at 5.5546 yuan. The buying and selling prices at small money houses and bank counters were 5.545 and 5.56 yuan. Allied notes fell another five points, with dealers selling at 3.80 yuan and buying at 3.75 yuan.</p>
<h3>Overcrowding of Floating Positions: The Bond Market Suddenly Experiences Turbulence</h3>
<p>The public bond market initially saw high enthusiasm yesterday, with prices continuing to rise sharply. Type C bonds rose from 8.50 yuan to a high of 9.30 yuan, but the high price attracted sellers. The floating positions have been very crowded for many days. As the situation changed slightly, more sellers appeared, with a low price of 6.70 yuan. The final price was only 7 yuan. The magnitude of the turbulence and the anxiety of the people can be imagined. Type A bonds were around 5.50 yuan, Type B bonds were around 4.50 yuan, and Type D bonds temporarily reached a high of 5.50 yuan due to a severe shortage of spot goods, but it was only a fleeting moment, and the price plunged to 2.60 yuan. Type E bonds were around 3.50 yuan, but they also once reached 6 yuan. With such large ups and downs, there will definitely be major changes in the future. This is a natural phenomenon of too many floating positions.</p>
<h3>Flat-Price Sale of Soybeans</h3>
<p>The military allocation authorities recently handed over 6,000 bags of flat-price soybeans to the Miscellaneous Grains Group, which began distributing the goods yesterday. The distribution method stipulates: 7 bags per tofu shop, 6 bags per miscellaneous grain retailer, 5 bags per sauce garden, and 4 bags for fried goods, bean sprout, and bean product businesses. Tofu and soy milk shops received 1 bag. The price was 48 yuan per dan of military currency, a sharp increase of 12 yuan compared to the previous allocation price.</p>
<h3>Soybean Cake Gradually Feels Unsupported</h3>
<p>According to sources, large quantities of soybean cake are currently accumulated in Shanghai, becoming a target for speculation. Farmers, on the other hand, are unable to afford to buy fertilizer due to the high price, which has a significant impact on agricultural production. It is said that the authorities will buy it at a price of 95 to 100 yuan for reasonable distribution. As a result, people are apprehensive, and support from various parties is gradually becoming weak. The market trend is towards exhaustion. The following are the prices: Fei Zi soybean cake, 119 yuan per vehicle, with another two vehicles to be delivered in one week at 120 yuan. Yuanlong soybean cake, five vehicles at 119 to 118 yuan. Sheng Ji soybean cake, 2,000 pieces to be delivered in March at 121.75 to 118 yuan. Shanghai factory cake, 1,500 pieces to be delivered by the end of February at 117 to 119 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gu Ben Soap Nears 1,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The market for daily necessities remains firm, and prices are unlikely to fall. The market continued to see rises but no falls yesterday. The prices were: Phoenix matches, 5,400 yuan; Beauty matches, 5,500 yuan; Gold Tripod matches, 4,300 yuan; Miscellaneous brand matches, 3,000 yuan. Gu Ben soap was close to ten yuan, with a new high price of 990 yuan yesterday. Bai Xiangmao was 910 yuan, Huang Xiangmao was 870 yuan, Scissors soap was 950 yuan, Price's candles were 600 yuan, Monk Hat brand candles were 540 yuan, and miscellaneous brand candles were 380 yuan.</p>
<h3>Nanyang Distributes Goods: The Price of Licensed Cigarettes Increases</h3>
<p>In the cigarette market, British and American goods have recently fluctuated, showing a state of hovering. The prices yesterday were 200 to 300 yuan higher than before. Japanese cigarettes have rarely risen or fallen, remaining stable. Nanyang, a domestic cigarette company, suddenly distributed goods yesterday, and the price of licensed cigarettes increased compared to before, so the market trend was firm. The prices were: Great Britain brand, 13,200 yuan; Old Knife brand, 10,700 yuan; Pin Hai brand, 8,300 yuan; Five Flowers brand, 7,200 yuan; Fairy brand, 8,350 yuan; Japanese cigarettes: Gold Gun brand, 3,400 yuan; Gold Building, 4,300 yuan; Red Rose, 3,800 yuan; Quan Lu brand, 4,000 yuan; Twenty Branch, 3,500 yuan; Compass brand, 3,400 yuan; Domestic cigarettes: Pyramid, 8,000 yuan; Beauty brand, 7,300 yuan; Gold Mouse brand, 4,400 yuan; White Gold Dragon, 4,800 yuan.</p>
<h3>Bitter Apricot Gradually Rises</h3>
<p>Due to the small amount of bitter apricot in stock and the tight prices in the producing areas, the Shanghai market is also gradually rising. In addition, the price level last winter was still suitable, making it easier to raise the price. Pharmaceutical dealers have been absorbing it in recent days, and prices have risen by 20% to 30%. If the supply is not sustained, it will still need to be watched closely.</p>
<h3>China Industrial Monthly Published</h3>
<p>The China Industrial Monthly, sponsored by the China Industrial Bank, is a publication for communication between factories and banks. The inaugural issue is scheduled to be published at the end of February. The content includes papers by Xu Guanqun, Zhu Boquan, Zhu Sihuang, Zhou Qibang, Wang Jianshi, Liu Yunfang, Chen Derong, Wang Yutong, Zhu Binyuan, etc., as well as other news reports and statistics. Subscriptions have already begun. The price is 30 yuan per year and 16 yuan per half year (with postage added for outside areas).

<h3>Strengthening the Wartime Economic System: Establishing an Economic Investigation Office</h3>
<p>Since taking office, the government has spared no effort to strengthen the wartime economic system. According to news obtained from relevant parties, the National Government, when convening the Supreme National Defense Council a few days ago, decided to establish an Economic Investigation Office as soon as possible, specializing in this matter, in view of the urgent need to investigate the wartime economy at present. This investigation office, together with the Ministry of Industry, Construction, Food, Finance, and Social Welfare, as well as the suggestions of the North China Political Affairs Commission, the industry and finance departments, is engaged in organizing. As for the National Economic Commission, which is about to be established, it will specialize in deliberation.</p>

<h3>Savings</h3>
<p>— Shi Gao Ming</p>
<p>According to the study of life scientists, squirrels often collect many fruits in summer and autumn and store them separately in several tree holes as food for the winter. In winter, squirrels eat the stored fruits. However, sometimes they forget where the fruits are stored, so some of the stored fruits are stolen by other squirrels, and some become moldy.</p>
<p>Squirrels know how to save and defend against the cold winter. In the eyes of people, this is a "good habit" or "virtue." Cicadas and butterflies only know how to sing and dance in the summer; when winter comes,</p>
<p>First, saving is to save the money that can be saved now and keep it for use in times of emergency in the future. The purpose is for "life," not for "getting rich." This basic concept must be clarified; otherwise, you will gradually embark on the path of a "miser."</p>
<p>Second, if there is surplus money to save, safety comes first. Do not lend at high interest rates, and especially do not engage in speculative businesses that disrupt society.</p>
<p>Third, if the amount of saved money is extremely large and exceeds your own and your family's reasonable needs, you should automatically allocate a portion to do things that benefit society.</p>
<p>If you only know how to save for money, if you exploit others to increase the number of your savings; this kind of saving loses its original meaning.</p>
<p>Human wisdom is at least higher than that of squirrels. If you do not know how to save, then you are ashamed to be compared to a squirrel. If you do not save and steal other people's savings; or if you save but do not use it well; then you can truly "look at each other and smile, and have no disagreement in your hearts" with squirrels.</p>
<h3>The Faith of Taking Risks</h3>
<p>— Yuan Tao</p>
<p>Please don't: think that I am discussing profound philosophies or writing an "impractical" article. On the contrary, I am using a religious theory to evaluate a real event in today's society.</p>
<p>There are two famous sayings in the Christian Bible: "Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." Let me borrow them to explain the driving force behind the recent success of a social event.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, a cause or movement that benefits society and the people is inevitably isolated and fraught with difficulties at its inception: the ridicule and doubt of onlookers, the extreme shortage of funds, and the scarcity of supporters are all considered "common occurrences" by those enthusiastic about public welfare. But what supports their ability to endure hardships and complete their initial goals with unwavering spirit, benefiting the majority of their compatriots in distress? In a word: faith, unwavering faith—relying on the belief that their goals are pure and their motives are altruistic. Even though there may be many difficulties in the initial stages, public opinion rests in the hearts of the people, and the arrival of success and the achievement of "things hoped for" can be expected with certainty. This success and the "things hoped for" are what are called "things not seen," but because of "faith," a guarantee of completion and "evidence" are finally obtained.</p>
<p>Not long ago, I happened to be talking to a friend about the "Shen Bao Student Aid Fund," and he sincerely told me: "The remaining amount of this student aid fund is only a little over 110,000, while the amount needed is more than 300,000, a difference of at least 200,000, which has not yet been secured... However, anything that benefits society must be done, regardless of whether there is enough money or not. What does it matter to take a little risk, endure a little hardship, and run around for society all day, appealing and even begging?... This risk must be taken, even if we don't have the money, we don't care, we must do it..." I listened quietly to these words at the time and did not have a deep impression, thinking they were just platitudes. But as the days passed, the "color" gradually became apparent: donations continued to come in, and messages of sympathy flew in like snowflakes. In those short twenty days (up to the time I wrote this article), the total amount of donations had exceeded 400,000.</p>
<p>Isn't this "faith"? Indeed, it is, because they believed: "Good things must be done even without money"; "Justice resides in the hearts of the people"; "Money can be donated, as long as we know how to promote it"!</p>
<p>However, what if this matter has been launched very enthusiastically, but money cannot be raised? Therefore, they "believed" on the one hand, and "took risks" on the other (as my friend said himself), forming a kind of faith as firm as iron—"the faith of taking risks"! This faith finally gave them abundant harvests.</p>
<p>This is an undeniable fact, not bragging; this is the success of a faith test, not a castle in the air. Finally, I must declare for myself: I am not an employee of the Shen Bao, nor have I been entrusted by them. I believe in religion, I have a social conscience, I cannot but speak!</p>
<h3>On Medical Ethics</h3>
<p>— Qiji</p>
<p>Practicing medicine is the most sacred profession. A doctor has a great responsibility to his patients. Patients have not studied medicine and listen to the doctor's words in every way. The doctor says it is a certain disease and a certain treatment is needed, and the patient absolutely believes it. Therefore, doctors are extra cautious when prescribing medicine, and they must first use various methods to make the diagnosis accurate before prescribing medicine. If they cannot determine the root cause of the disease themselves, or encounter difficult symptoms, fearing that their knowledge is insufficient to cope with it, then they should honestly explain the situation and ask the patient to invite another doctor to consult together. They must study it thoroughly before deciding whether to give an injection, perform surgery, or use other treatments. In this area, famous doctors especially need to be careful, because with a great reputation, the patient's faith is stronger on the one hand, and on the other hand, even a small mistake will inevitably affect their reputation. Therefore, famous doctors in the past often became sad and tearful because they could not cure their patients. Here is an example:</p>
<p>In Zhang Dafu's "Notes from the Plum Blossom Thatched Cottage," there is a section titled "King Fa":</p>
<p>"He Jichong in the city made it so that there were no vacant houses inside and outside the city, no vacant docks by the water, no leisure for old and young women, work without stopping, cooking without stopping fuel, hands without stopping writing, and mouths without stopping answering, almost becoming a worldly medical king and mountain prime minister. Jichong diagnosed someone who did not survive, and tears fell."</p>
<p>There is also an account that mentions this medical king He Jichong: "...He Jichong used ginseng a lot, roughly the same as Miao Mutai, and the two of them were famous throughout Jiangnan, saving countless people..."</p>
<p>Being called a medical king and saving countless people, this kind of doctor can truly be proud. However, he absolutely did not have the habits of a famous doctor, but only knew how to wholeheartedly relieve the patient's pain, as if the patient's pain was his own pain. Therefore, when he encountered someone who did not survive, he could not help but shed tears. Although he clearly knew that there were many incurable diseases, and the doctor was powerless, his compassionate heart arose spontaneously. He always felt that he had not done his best. This spirit can truly last for thousands of years. If doctors all embraced this spirit when they entered the world, then we would not worry about the day when medical ethics would be promoted and developed.</p>
<h3>Who Doesn't Have Children, How Can They Bear to See Them Trampled?</h3>
<p>— Tianming</p>
<h3>The Division Between Ideals and Desires</h3>
<p>— Cheng Jusun</p>
<p>No matter what people do, they always have a purpose for it—some are ideal, and some are desire.</p>
<p>Young people who have just experienced the world often have ideals that outweigh desires, because young students who have just left their families' embrace, and are full of vigor, have not yet clearly seen the darkness of society, and only rely on their reasonable imagination to speculate on everything, and work diligently and step by step to achieve their ideal goals, because ideals have realistic goals, and are not empty slogans, and the reasoning is straightforward and clear. Only an ideal life can bring people a bright and happy future, so their hope of success is also very certain.</p>
<p>However, when material temptations become excessive, young people with wavering wills will feel that their enjoyment is insufficient and tend towards extravagant desires. Reasonable imagination then turns into the illusionary dreams of desire. In order to achieve this desired goal, they have to rack their brains to search everywhere for their needs. However, desire is only a缥缈 delusion. It is like a rugged mountain road, causing them to encounter stinging thorns everywhere, making them fall into a迷茫 illusion, and living in a life of烦恼 and worry. Therefore, the hope of success is as impossible as a "castle in the air."</p>
<p>Young people! The desires of the world are endless, but people's energy is ultimately limited. If you use limited energy to pursue endless desires, then things will overcome people thousands of times. How can you not fall into the deep abyss of suffering? Rather than suffer at that time, it is better to turn back as soon as possible, submerge your own will, stand in your proper position, grasp "realistic imagination," and work diligently with an indomitable spirit. Then the ideal success will soon come before your eyes.</p>
<h3>A Corner of the Balcony</h3>
<p>— Lin Lixiu Rong</p>
<p>Seeing Mr. Huang Zhenrong's two articles on replanting vegetables in the garden published in this journal, I thought of my balcony. I have a natural love for the rural atmosphere, but living in a pigeon coop-like house in Shanghai, even the vegetables bought from the market are no longer fresh. Fortunately, there is still a sun-drenched balcony that can be used to indulge in rural hobbies.</p>
<p>The balcony is for public use, and the families on the three floors above and below all need to dry clothes, so only a few mud pots and mud boxes can be piled in the corner. In such a small place, and not being soil, I dare not expect any harvest, only hoping to see various kinds of germination, flowering, and fruiting.</p>
<p>The pomegranate tree was bought ready-made. The rest of the pumpkins, edamame, cowpeas, beans, Dutch beans, tomatoes, and peppers were all sown by myself. After a few months of fertilization, irrigation, and insect catching, there were results. It was indeed a fact, but even I myself seemed to dare not believe it. Surprisingly, everything had a harvest. There were the most cowpeas, only seven or eight edamame, and the pumpkin weighed half a catty and there was only one. Although there were few fruits, the place was also small. Looking at it, it was a lush scene, and the joy in my heart was truly indescribable.</p>
<p>These harvests are certainly too small to taste. Only seven or eight edamame were harvested, and more than that were sown. But at least there is the educational value it brings. Several children, either in high school, junior high school, or elementary school, pay close attention to the changes in the color of the leaves, the differences between stamens and pistils, the results, and the pollination of bees. Occasionally, when bringing classmates home, they must be led to the balcony and can also娓娓叙述 various growth conditions. When I was sowing, I only cared about my own rural hobby, and later I noticed that this was a rather interesting living textbook.</p>
<p>It is almost time for sowing again. With last year's experience, this year's harvest will surely be better!</p>
<h3>Teacher for All Ages</h3>
<p>— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>After 1929, Chipping did not leave Brookfield – not even for the "Old Boys" dinner in London. He was afraid of catching a cold, and late nights made him uncomfortable. However, on fine days he still came to the school: in his room, he continued to entertain guests extensively. His talents were not lost in the slightest, and he had no personal troubles. His income exceeded what he needed to spend, and his small capital, invested in first-class stocks, was not affected when stock prices generally plummeted. He gave a lot of money to those who came to him to talk about poverty and suffering, to various donations to the school, and to the Brookfield Church. In 1930, he made his will. In addition to gifts to the church and Mrs. Wickett, he donated all his money to the school as a public scholarship.</p>
<p>1931… 1932.</p>
<p>"What is your opinion of Hoover, sir?"</p>
<p>"Do you think we will return to gold?"</p>
<p>"How do you feel about things in general, sir? Do you see a glimmer of light in the dark future?"</p>
<p>"When will the tide turn, Chipping, old boy? With all your experience, you should know."</p>
<p>Everyone asked him questions as if he were some mixture of prophet and encyclopedia – even beyond that, because they liked the answers they got, always accompanied by a joke. He would say:—</p>
<p>"Well, Henderson, when I was – er – a very young man – there would always be someone who would come out – um – promising people ninepence for fourpence. I don't know if anyone – er – ever got it, but – er – our current rulers seem – um – to be solving the problem: how to take out – er – fourpence to exchange for ninepence."</p>
<p>Great laughter. (44) Social Services</p>
<h3>Ningbo Elementary School Teacher Respect Movement Seven Hundred New Year's Money Donated to Medical Aid Fund</h3>
<p>(Letter) During the winter vacation, we saw your newspaper's organization of the "Elementary School Teacher Medical Aid Fund," which we greatly admired! At the same time, seeing the enthusiastic response from all parties made us even more moved!</p>
<p>Everyone understands the poverty and great responsibility of elementary school teachers, especially we, the group being taught, deeply understand the teacher's situation. Only because we are young and weak, in addition to being grateful in our hearts and comforting in words, we simply cannot talk about material rewards. This cannot help but make us feel infinite惆怅 and shame.</p>
<p>Recently, taking advantage of the opportunity to receive New Year's money during the Lunar New Year, everyone automatically launched the "Teacher Respect Movement," dedicating all the New Year's money as much as possible to your newspaper's "Elementary School Teacher Medical Aid Fund." Now this movement has temporarily come to an end, totaling seven hundred yuan. We specially send representatives to offer the full amount. And we sincerely hope that all students in Shanghai will actively promote this movement in any way.</p>
<p>Finally, we must solemnly declare: our actions are not ordinary relief donations, but a small token of respect from the bottom of our hearts for accepting the teacher's谆谆 teaching—Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association First Elementary School All Students Qǐ.</p>
