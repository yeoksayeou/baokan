<p>社評</p>
<h3>中日曆史上光榮一頁　敬謝東條首相訪華</h3>
<p>日本東條首相訪華，是中華民國歷史上最光榮的一頁，是中日兩國眞正平等，密切提携由理論到實踐的開始，我們中國人民將永遠記憶這一盛事—決不是平常的敬謝所能表達的。我們以中國人民的立塲，對於這件中日歷史上的大事，自有深刻的印象與表示摯誠的意念的必要。</p>
<p>友邦日本的首相向不輕出國門，特別是在戰時，東條首相身總萬機，統攬大局，訪問吾邦，其意義之重大，其眞誠之可感，決不是筆墨所能形容的。同時，自我中華民國建立以來，友邦政府的首長親臨訪問，也以東條首相爲第一人。特別値得紀念的，是首相之訪問，正是友邦宣佈撤廢對華治外法權，交還租界，移交敵產之後，也正是中日兩國開始站在完全平等與友好立塲之時。</p>
<p>在這種意義之下，我們深信首相這次訪華，一定能够更增進兩國友好合作的關係，而至於無疆的久遠。同時，亦必能使中日乃至東亞各國人民，深信由於東亞兩大國之友好合作，必能永保東亞各國的共存共榮，這是我們深刻感想的第一點。</p>
<p>首相訪華，正當我國參戰以來的第三個月，正當我國政治，軍事，經濟，文化各方面轉向戰時體制的時候，也正是我國各方面都迫切期待着友邦首相之指導與扶助的時候。因此，我們對於首相此行，懷有殷切的期待。同時中國人民也必須準備擔負起新的任務，和艱鉕的責任。現代的戰爭將是長期戰中取得迅速而全面的勝利，必須付出相當的代價。在過去，由於我國處在特殊的情形，大東亞戰爭是由友邦獨力進行着的，也就是由友邦獨力爲東亞各民族的解放而支付代價。可是，在我國業巳參戰，而中日完全站在平等地位的今日，我們決不能繼續由日本片面的作戰與單方的支付未來幸福的代價，我們要有挺身的勇氣與犧牲奮鬥的決心，這是我們敢向首相和友邦朝野摯誠披瀝的第二點。</p>
<p>我們對於首相訪華，最感到不安和痛心的，就是我國還有一部分國土之內，在英美帝國主義的愚弄和控制之下，繼續站在與友邦敵對的立塲而作不幸的戰事。但是我們可以坦白地指出，凡是我們中國人民都已在此新時代開始覺醒了，英美帝國主義最近對渝所宣佈的欺騙性的廢除不平等條約之舉，及其實際上援助之瀕於斷絕，而徒然要求以我國國土作戰塲，以我國人民充砲灰，這種惡毒的狡計，必然更將激起我西南西北各省同胞的反抗·全中國同胞站在東亞被壓迫民族大團結的旗幟之下，特別是站在中日兩大民族團結合作的旅幟之下，以最後擊潰英美帝國主義侵略東亞的惡勢力的日子，是會迅速來臨的。這是我們於敬謝首相訪問之餘，所敢鄭重說明的第三點。</p>
<p>這次首相之訪問我邦，對於兩國當局及國策的親密協合，必然有劃時代的成功。同時，我們更密切期待着，不久的明天，就有友邦民間的代表團與我國民間的代表團互相訪問，因爲我們深信，兩國民間的互相了解與協力，是兩國共同政策貫澈的前提，也是兩國共同理想與信念能够迅速實現的最大的保證。</p>

<p>整備擴充會之組織，以精銳會員之實踐力，使成爲會之運動的中核，同時，靑少年特加訓練，使繼承，體察滿洲之建國精神。（翔：譯自三月八日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<p>吾國物資統制工作、原由友邦各機關辦理、現在友邦當局本諸協力合作之精神、以極大熱忱、萬分決心、將統制物資一事、交還我國自辦、仍尤隨時協助、促其成功、政府則以由政府主辦、恐與商情隔閡、轉交由經濟自治集團主持辦理、政府除頒布法規、仍處於監督指導地位、兩國當局顧念民生、無微不至之盛意、凡屬人民、均應萬分感謝、論本會性質、係屬同業公會之集團機構、按照組織程序、本應先從下層做起、現以時間關係、一面由政府指定人員組織總會、一面健全同業機構、使物資統制工作不致影響中斷、原屬一時權宜之計、但總會會員、仍係同業公會份子、辦法雖屬變通、精神依然存在、不過本人仍希望按照原定組織程序健全各地同業公會、使總會之成立、得以符合集體自治之眞正精神、俾統制工作之進行、愈見圓滑順利、統制辦法、在我國尙屬創舉、一切條件、多未具備、參考資料、尙付闕如、施行時之種種困難、自在　中、其最感困難者、厥爲統制政策與自由經濟政策性質完全相反、而自由經濟政策在中國又早已根深蒂固、一旦轉移政策、不但商業方面感覺不便、即消費者方面亦不無遇事動受束縛限制之感想、不過吾人須認淸統制辦法、第一爲世界潮流所親、第二爲國家政策所在、在此民生關頭亟待解決之際、舍此更無途徑、祗有羣策羣力、拋除小我之見、共謀國策之推進、以達到大我之目的、此次組設總會、時間極爲忽促、被指定諸人、因義無可辭、出而担任、對于本會之組織如何可使更臻健全、恐尙須有長時間之硏究考慮、幷根據實際經騐、逐步加以改善、在草創時期、定多難滿人意之處、即本人亦有同樣感想、希望政府長官、友邦當局、以及中日雙方各界人士、在諒解之下、寄以同情、多方指導協助、尤其希望友邦各機關長官、以及由上而下之各級機關、本協力合作之精神、予以重大之協助、其次則希望友邦各商業團體、本兩國當局商定之平等原則、切實合作、將來或許因施行法令有所不能切合各個商業願望之處、在此種塲合之下、務請加以特別諒解、</p>

<p>最後、仍願重複鄭重聲明者、即本會倉卒成立、同人對於物資統制工作、均少研究經騐、辦理之不能完養、早在預料之中、希望各界人士、萬萬不可多存奢望、本會同人、亦自當在公正坦自廉潔信條之下、努力前進、以求不負社會對於本會之屬望、務請政府畏官·友邦當局，雙方商業團發·以及各界人士、隨時予以匡正指導、本會同人、願以十分熱誠、敬謹接受」、</p>

<p>評言</p>
<h3>獻給全國商業統制總會</h3>
<p>全國商業統制總會成立以後，將如何努力工作，以副政府之期望，與友邦之善意，昨已略有論列，茲再貢獻一言：</p>
<p>（一）在事人員，應打破私人利益念頭，凡僅使少數人獲有利益而使多數人感受困難者，宜竭力避免。</p>
<p>（二）安定物價，最好使黑市價値無從產生，目下官定之物品價格，應核算其成本，用科學方法，予以提高，俾擁有物資者，不致藏匿不賣，此爲初步方法。</p>
<p>（三）辦事手續，以簡單迅捷爲貴，望一洗已往官塲惡習唇　留難。</p>
<p>（四）最宜取得交通，稅收，軍警各方面之協力合作，一致盡力於事務之推進。</p>
<p>（五）似應網羅各業領袖各同業公會之主幹，擔任顧問，統盤籌畫最公允之支配與收購。</p>
<p>（六）蘇浙皖三省京滬兩市，卽為試辦區域，則此三省二市之都市商埠，均應指定地方公正人負責主持，洗禮推動。</p>
<p>總之，　鉅兩字，足以形容該會之工作狀態。主持者誠宜縝密計畫，以副政府加緊戰時生產之主旨，尤宜具有毅力與決心，任勞任怨，不避艱阻，破除情面，用十二萬分之大無畏精卿，以制勝此艱難偉大之工作。</p>
<h3>棉花統制會　收買棉花新計劃</h3>

<h3>中日事業銀行　擴展營業添設分行</h3>
<p>本市北四川路六九三號中日實業銀行，爲中日金融界鉅子合資創設，於去年九月間開業，對於中日工商業之資金調劑，頗爲認眞服務，致業務日臻發達，各種存款，數字激增，放款部份，則遵照政府規定法令，審愼辦理，通匯業務，亦稱不惡，茲悉該行爲擴展業務便利商民起見，將自下月起將總行行址栘設江西路三百七十一號，（前江蘇銀行）辦理業務，原有北四川路六九三號行址，則改爲分行。聞該行因擴充營業，行員不敷應用，特於月前招考行員，現經審査及格錄取四十餘名，均已到行服務。</p>
<h3>杭州新茶瞬將上市</h3>
<p>成本高昂產量難豐</p>
<p>茶葉本爲我國特產品之一，而本埠向爲華茶外銷之重要口岸。但自事變以來，因外銷停頓，產地貨物，又不能暢達上海，故本埠茶市，已一落千丈。最近一年來均不過本街銷塲及新藥業略有需要而已。至於茶葉之來源則僅仰給於杭州一地，寗波方面亦偶有運來，但爲數殊微。茲奢淸明時屆，杭州茶葉，又至萌芽時期，新茶瞬將上市，頃自茶商方面探悉，今年茶業產量，因年來地方不靖，生活高漲，製茶成本，又不斷高漲，故出產難豐價格，亦難望平定。</p>

<p>譯論</p>
<h3>對於全國商業統制總會之觀感</h3>
<p>昨日泰晤士報對於全國商業統制總會之成立，作如下之觀感：「全國商業統制總會給於民間商業團體以較大之活動範圍，參加華中一帶之經濟與工商方面活動。無論自任何一個角度觀察，此一機構之成立，可以復興華中之經濟繁榮，强化南京政府在和平區域以內之施政權力。</p>
<p>「依照此次新的條例，所有揚子下遊流域之物資移動，以前概由日本陸軍當局發給許可證者，今後統由商業統制總會發給。祇須取得總會之許可，工商界即得以條例中所指定之物資，由上海地區移運至其他和平區內，或由其他和平區內移運至上海地區。如此，上海工商業必可蒙其惠益，因而促成上海以及鄰近區域之工業復興。</p>
<p>「南京政府現正籌設名省市經濟局，直接受實業部之整督，專司登記，監理，指導各種工商組織，並以促進工商事業之改良，經濟市塲之復興，與一切物價之調整爲其任務。關於此類事宜，悉由經濟局興全國商業統制總會通力合作辦理。</p>
<p>「由此足見商業統制總會之活動範圍，實普及於工商實業各部門，並足成爲南京政府與民間經濟界之中間聯絡機構。此舉誠足稱爲復興中國經濟之必要措施，而中國銀行界興工商界領袖人物之推誠合作，尤足成爲此項計劃前途成功之左券。今後物資之購買，原料之配給，既均統制有人，南京政府自可目睹國家生活之趨於安定，蓋不能有安定之國家生活，亦卽不能有健余之經濟發展。</p>
<p>今後中國金融界與實業界領袖之責任，因其旣經參加全國商業統制總會以後，勢必格外加重。無論如何，今後中日兩國與兩國人民間的合作基礎，由此可吿奠定。</p>
<h3>市區對無證市民　拒絕通行</h3>

<h3>第三十期口糧　全部配給整米</h3>
<p>公共租界雙法租界各立約米店、昨起向工部局米粉配給　價取第三十期戶口糧買單、是項目買單係由來業同業公會　得後、轉發給各會員立約米店、今日起、各米店依照買單規定、向工部局繳付貨款、憑提單同指定之棧房出貨、准本月二十一日起、憑買米證麵粉證發售、其有效時期至三月三十日爲止、</p>
<p>數量售價</p>
<p>本報記者昨向米業探悉、第三十期買寫上所規定之米爲整米一種、並無碎米之搭配、且大都爲白米、糙米佔少數、惟麵粉為二號紛及三號紛二種、其整米與麵粉之數量及各米店之領取價格與本期相同、所以預料下期戶口糧數、大致並無變更、即食米二升半、計六元三角、麵粉二號三號合計一斤十二兩、計三元八角半，惟確實搭配數量及價格、須以工部局之正式公吿爲準、</p>

<h3>人欲橫流</h3>
<p>— 黃同</p>
<p>有一個朋友，很幽默地對我說：「麻將和姨太太，是上海多數里弄的特色。」這位朋友，並無統計的根據，僅隨便說說罷了。但是，如果我們有閒情逸致，到多數里弄去訪問，準可聽見劈劈拍拍的麻將聲音。如果你在一個里弄住久了，仔細一打聽，就將驚異上海姨太太之多。</p>
<p>打麻將和討姨太太，是我國嚴重的病態，這是無可諱言，也不必諱言的。有些男子，一心想發「寫意財：」發了財，整天打麻將消遣，討姨太太作樂，有些女子，只有打麻將的本領，貪吃懶做，心服情願地做姨太太。人欲橫流，請問家庭怎麽會健全？國家，社會怎麽會富强？</p>
<p>正心，誠意，修身，齊家，治國，平天下，這一套功夫，並非儒家的迂闊之詞。要國家民族不腐化，不受淘汰，這一套功夫是絕對少不了的。</p>
<p>用法律禁賭，並不予姨太太以法律保障，確有相當功效。治本方法，還在：普及敎育，發展工商業，和提倡正當娛樂。政府官吏和社會上有地位的人士，以及大學敎授，中小學敎師，如果都以身作則，一定能够移風易俗，革除積弊。</p>
<h3>論廣義的讀者</h3>
<p>— 江浪</p>
<p>提起讀書，有很多人以爲這是一座象牙之塔，不得其門而入；有許多人以爲這是迷路的十字街口，找不到目前的方向。但這可以說，都是胡亂的鑲了一二本不適於自己，誠得半途而廢，覺得生硬乏味的書的反應。結果，非但增不起對書的與趣，反乎添了對書的望洋興嘆，其實，讀書並不是啃着一本綫裝或精裝的紙本，從第一句讀到末一句，這是狹義的讀法，只適宜於初學的人。</p>
<p>然，讀書並不是爲了讀集紙而成的害，而是爲了生活，要從那裏面去探索點我們生活的途徑，解決我們生活的難題。但每一個人的途徑是不同的，著書的人也不能寫出一本適宜於人人可以適應的書，而每一個人在人生道上所遇到的難題，也絕非魚魯相似，所以著作者只能粗陋的供給一些參考罷了，因爲這個緣故，讀書就不可一味的仰書本鼻息，而得向環繞着你的大自然中去開拓，去發展，這就是所謂廣義的讀書了。</p>
<p>大自然就是一部沒字的百科全書，世界各民族國家的組織情形，不就是一部現成的經濟，政治社會的參考書麽，山川河澤，林木花鳥，魚蟲走獸，不是一部包羅萬象的生物書麽？蘋果墜地，鐵會生銹的道理，不就是一部理化的敎科書麽？所以我們隨時隨地可以獲得書本上所講述的事物，更可以得着不少得之於己的補充材料，足够你一生的應用了。</p>
<p>從上面幾點看來，讀書無疑的是爲要充實知識。知識本身好像太陽的光，全世界的人都能享受得到，除了有些自暴自棄的人，寗願不見天日，那就一輩子只弄得個貧血的弱者，結果旣無從解決生活的難題，也萬難做個社會上的完人。</p>
<p>求知的機會，旣然到處都有，我們應該要想幾個方法，不使它們逃過，我們要儘量的握住，儘量的利用，那就得依賴着下面幾項法則做去：</p>
<p>（甲）精密的親察——我們要將一種知識技能學習得好，必須要加以詳細的觀察，尋出它的眞理之所在，「心不在焉，視而不見，聽而不聞，食而不知其味。」可見無論對於什麽事物，非平心靜氣的精密的加以觀察，是難以奏效的，所以當你在公園裏徘徊的時候，你該利用你的眼光，去觀察動植物的生活形態。參觀工廠的時候，大可以觀察一下機械的權能，懷疑那僅出發在一處的力，怎會使全部的機械都發生動力而工作起來。所以瓦特也曾說過一句話：「我的成功，不過是去觀察一切新發現的東西罷了。」</p>
<p>（乙）筆録——有人說：「思想像一隻小鳥，不即刻捉住，倐忽便飛去了，」我們從觀察得到的知識，要靠着記憶力去保存，那是最浪費腦力與時間的事。所以，必須隨時隨地捉住自己的心得，筆錄下來。這有兩層好處：一以擴大自己知識的領域，使它漸漸因境界的擴大而有新的發現；一以取得佐證，使自己的意見可以與見到的事物相引證，而研究兩方面是否確切與精當。美國的小說家霍桑，據說他無論走在街上，坐在車裏，或往各處去遊歷的時候，身邊總帶着一本小冊子，只要思想一浮現，便立刻記下來。（這點我們到很可以效法的。）</p>
<p>（丙）談話——現在的求知，是集團的，不是從前一個人靜居古寺或獨坐書齋讀那四書五經的時代了，而是聚集了幾個同志的朋友，談談各人的心得，這是最有益於知識的，把値得保存的，便筆錄起來，以爲將來的參考。不値得保存的，便放棄它，這樣自然會使自已的知識趣於正確了。</p>
<p>我的所謂廣義的讀書，便是如此，遺漏的地方當然還很多。但若能打好書本上的基礎，再放棄利用書本（也不是絕對的）而從事於大自然的觀察，觀察心得的筆錄，與佐證心得和觀念的談話，這樣，也可以增加一個人的知識。</p>
<h3>木造機帆船</h3>
<p>— 龍漁夫</p>
<p>報載：香港建設槪况，其中記着：『…關於船舶之建造與修理，進行極爲順利，木造機帆船之建造，成績尤佳。爲增强香港運輸能力，此種木造機帆船，現已使用於香港與南方間之物資運輸，且已利用木造機帆船以爲當地運輸之一大補助…』</p>
<p>當此物價飛漲，船隻缺少的目前，木造機帆船的建造，實為目前急不緩待的一椿大事！我們應該利用這種船隻作爲目前唯一的交通工具！如疏散過剩人口歸鄕，前往越泰國等處運送糧食……都可利用。</p>
<p>據說：道種木造機船，是添置木造機器，用人力使它轉動，不需要燃料，非常便利。如果上海有了這種木造機帆船那末，天津，靑島，厦門，汕頭，香港，以及長江流域，都可以利用它作爲輸送物資的唯一工具了。</p>
<h3>天才謎</h3>
<p>— 莎蕾</p>
<p>三歲能詩，七歲成章，被尊爲這是有天才的，愛迪生在電學上的造就，也稱做天才的發明家。天才，天才，多少人像謎一樣的崇拜。</p>
<p>然而也有人根本否認世界上有天才存在，說這不過是不努力者卸除自己肩頭應負責任的話。</p>
<p>設若承認世間眞有天才。以同有音樂天才的兩兒童，一關置深山荒剎中，不使同外界接觸，不使調管弄弦；另一個呢？使他天天沉浸在音樂的氛圍中，督促之，敎育之，結果，不難使我們想到他們之間的差異，前者成了蠢漢，而後者在音樂上有了成就。那末，我們是否說前者沒有天才，祗承認後者才有天才呢？</p>
<p>這樣說來，先天的天才根本不足憑持——彷彿一株嫩弱的樹苗，不經陽光雨露的滋潤，不去壅肥栽培，即使幸而不失了生機，也必定生長得纖纖弱弱，毫不受人注意。所以參天古木，是有成其高與大的條件。一個有天才的兒童，後天的環境與敎養，獎勵與誘掖，他自身的努力，才能發揚蹈勵</p>
<p>愛迪生說：「一分天才，九分努力」，我覺得這才是天才適當的註解。</p>
<h3>根</h3>
<p>— 辛波</p>
<p>寫了一會，他忽然停住筆，回過頭，對坑床上問着說：『到底作價多少呢？』</p>
<p>『不是說大洋五十四元麽？』楊子傑回答</p>
<p>『不通，不過，』根明連忙接着說：『五十四元實在不够用，還請黃老爺多添不些。』他說得很淸楚，很安定。</p>
<p>『老根，你不要不知足，』黃崇菴板了面孔說：『我要不是爲了三個月以前，在你家住過幾天，我還不要你的田呢！你去打聽打聽看，現在的時世，還有誰肯將現款放出去買田的！』</p>
<p>『對呀！也是我再三說了，黃老爺才加給你四元錢。現在，……』楊子傑的話。</p>
<p>他們在說着價目的多少，兪篤周的筆就一直停着，不寫下去。</p>
<p>根明還是不表示同意，只在「不過不週」地聲說着。</p>
<p>『如果你眞的要多用幾元錢，』楊子傑下了坑床，走到賬桌邊來，『那末就不如將活契改作死契。』他那啞澀的聲音，為了有些急，格外啞澀了。</p>
<p>『這個我不能，』根明也站了起來，似乎怕兪篤周果然寫成了死契，要想預先攔住，『我退有五個兒子呢！』</p>
<p>他們又是一番爭論。根明到了這嚴重的關頭，完全沒有長怯。他說黃崇菴那一年不買進幾百畝田，區區一畝幾分，多給幾元田價，也不要緊，又說，黃崇菴如果在他這樣急難之中挽他一把，他總感激於心，將來一定要力圖報答，不必說三四個月以前住在他家的那一個情份。（十二）社會服務</p>

<h3>A Glorious Page in Sino-Japanese History: Respectfully Thanking Prime Minister Tojo for Visiting China</h3>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo's visit to China is the most glorious page in the history of the Republic of China, the beginning of true equality and close cooperation between China and Japan from theory to practice. We, the Chinese people, will forever remember this grand event—an expression of gratitude that ordinary respect cannot convey. Standing from the position of the Chinese people, towards this major event in Sino-Japanese history, we naturally have a profound impression and a need to express our sincere thoughts.</p>
<p>The prime ministers of friendly nation Japan do not lightly travel abroad, especially during wartime. Prime Minister Tojo, overseeing all aspects of the nation and commanding the overall situation, visiting our country, the significance of which is great, the sincerity of which is touching, cannot be described by words. At the same time, since the establishment of the Republic of China, the head of a friendly government visiting in person, Prime Minister Tojo is the first. Especially worthy of commemoration is that the Prime Minister's visit coincides with the friendly nation's declaration to abolish extraterritorial rights in China, return concessions, and transfer enemy property, and it is when China and Japan begin to stand on a completely equal and friendly footing.</p>
<p>Under this significance, we deeply believe that the Prime Minister's visit to China will certainly further enhance the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries, extending to an immeasurable and enduring future. At the same time, it will also enable the people of China, Japan, and even all countries in East Asia to deeply believe that the friendly cooperation between the two major powers of East Asia will certainly ensure the co-existence and co-prosperity of all countries in East Asia. This is the first point of our profound feelings.</p>
<p>Prime Minister's visit to China, is just in the third month since our country joined the war, is when our country's politics, military, economic, cultural, and other aspects are shifting to a wartime system, and is also when all aspects of our country are urgently looking forward to the guidance and assistance of the Prime Minister of the friendly nation. Therefore, we have earnest expectations for the Prime Minister's visit. At the same time, the Chinese people must also prepare to undertake new tasks and arduous responsibilities. Modern warfare will achieve rapid and comprehensive victory in a long-term war, and a considerable price must be paid. In the past, due to our country's special circumstances, the Greater East Asia War was being carried out independently by the friendly nation, that is, the friendly nation alone was paying the price for the liberation of all ethnic groups in East Asia. However, now that our country has already joined the war, and China and Japan are standing on an equal footing, we must not continue to allow Japan to unilaterally fight and unilaterally pay the price for future happiness. We must have the courage to stand up and the determination to sacrifice and fight. This is the second point that we dare to sincerely reveal to the Prime Minister and friendly nation.</p>
<p>What we feel most uneasy and heartbroken about regarding the Prime Minister's visit to China is that within a part of our country's territory, under the deception and control of British and American imperialism, it continues to stand in opposition to the friendly nation and wage unfortunate warfare. However, we can frankly point out that all of us Chinese people have already awakened with the beginning of this new era. The deceptive abolition of unequal treaties recently announced by British and American imperialism towards Chongqing, and their actual aid on the verge of being cut off, while merely demanding to use our country's territory as a battlefield and our country's people as cannon fodder, this insidious cunning plan will inevitably further arouse the resistance of our compatriots in the southwest and northwest provinces. All Chinese compatriots standing under the banner of the great unity of the oppressed ethnic groups in East Asia, especially standing under the banner of unity and cooperation between the two major ethnic groups of China and Japan, the day when the evil forces of British and American imperialism invading East Asia will be finally defeated will come quickly. This is the third point that we dare to solemnly explain in addition to respectfully thanking the Prime Minister for visiting.</p>
<p>This time, the Prime Minister's visit to our country will surely have epoch-making success in the close coordination between the authorities and national policies of the two countries. At the same time, we more closely expect that in the near future, delegations of friendly nation’s civilians and delegations of our country’s civilians will visit each other because we deeply believe that the mutual understanding and cooperation between the two countries' civilians is the prerequisite for the implementation of the two countries' common policies, and also the greatest guarantee that the two countries' common ideals and beliefs can be quickly realized.</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Tojo's Return Visit to China: Expressing Respect for the National Government's Participation in the War: Sino-Japanese Relations Will Become More Harmonious</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th, Central News Agency telegram: The Propaganda Department of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy in China, on March 15th, at 12:00 noon, jointly announced: Prime Minister Tojo of the Japanese Empire visited Chairman Wang in Nanjing on the 13th of this month, to thank Chairman's visit to Japan last December and to express respect for China's participation in the war, and had frank talks with the Chinese authorities on completing the joint war against Britain and the United States. He went to Shanghai on the 14th and returned to Japan today.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 15th, Central News Agency telegram: The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 11:04 AM on the 15th: "Prime Minister and Minister of the Army Tojo, in response to the visit of the Chairman of the Republic of China government to our country at the end of last year, and to personally express respect for the Republic of China's declaration of war against Britain and the United States, and the heads of the National Government held frank talks on completing the joint war plan, and inspected the Japanese agencies stationed in China, departed from Tokyo on March 12th to visit Nanjing, passing through Shanghai, and has now returned to the country on the 15th.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 15th, Central News Agency telegram: General Tojo Hideki, Prime Minister of the Japanese Empire's cabinet, in response to Chairman's visit to Japan last December, and to express respect for China's participation in the war, and regarding completing the joint war against Britain and the United States, came to Nanjing by plane from Japan on the 13th of this month to have cordial talks with our country's authorities. After arriving in Nanjing, he paid respects to Chairman Wang and conveyed his greetings. Subsequently, the Chairman, in his capacity as Premier of the Executive Yuan, had frank talks with Prime Minister Tojo. Both sides' opinions on various issues regarding completing the common goal were extremely harmonious. Minister Tojo went to Shanghai on the 14th and returned safely to Japan on the 15th. Our entire country, from top to bottom, deeply feels inspired by Prime Minister Tojo taking the time to visit during this great era of the Greater East Asia War. According to Japan, this is the first time that a sitting prime minister has visited a foreign country, and it fully demonstrates the intimacy of Sino-Japanese relations. People here generally believe that Prime Minister Tojo's visit will further increase the friendship between China and Japan, and as a new development in Sino-Japanese relations since the return of the National Government to the capital, this will be used as an opportunity to make a leap forward in various measures for the two countries to complete the common goal. Furthermore, Japan is about to return its exclusive concessions in our country and abolish extraterritorial rights. This kind of sincere assistance to our country in completing its independence and autonomy, and the friendly expression of Prime Minister Tojo's visit, have the same significance. Therefore, our people's belief in sharing weal and woe, living and dying together with Japan, is strengthened, and it is believed that Prime Minister Tojo's visit will further brighten the future of building a new order in East Asia.</p>
<h3>Chairman Wang Personally Arrived at the Airport to Greet Him: Hosted a Banquet in the National Government Auditorium: More Than a Hundred Sino-Japanese Dignitaries Were Invited to Accompany</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th, Central News Agency telegram: Prime Minister Tojo of Japan arrived in Nanjing by plane on the afternoon of the 13th. The day was sunny and clear, with a gentle breeze. At 1:27 PM, an airplane appeared in the sky above Zijin Mountain. After the plane landed, Chairman Wang and the heads of various ministries and commissions of the National Government, General Commander Hata of the Japanese side, Ambassador Shigemitsu, and others all came to the airport to welcome him. Prime Minister Tojo first shook hands with Chairman Wang and exchanged greetings, and then shook hands with each of the other welcoming personnel. He then went to the VIP room at the airport to rest. Prime Minister Tojo was in military uniform, with heroic and dashing spirit. His eyebrows and eyes were filled with fortitude and affection. He chatted happily with the welcomers in the VIP room for a while, and then took a specially prepared car to the headquarters of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China to listen to General Commander Hata's military report and held important talks for two hours. At 4:30 PM, Foreign Minister Chu went to welcome him to the Yingbin (Guest) House to rest. At 4:50 PM, Ambassador Shigemitsu and members of the embassy went to the Yingbin House to visit Prime Minister Tojo and report on the general situation for about 30 minutes. Then, the Prime Minister returned to the inner room to rest. At 5:30 PM, Ambassador Shigemitsu led Prime Minister Tojo to Chairman Wang's residence to pay respects to the Chairman and had a pleasant conversation for about 30 minutes before leaving and returning to the Yingbin House. At 6:10 PM, Ambassador Lu Ronghuan of Manchuria to China and Counselor Sekiya went to visit Prime Minister Tojo and left after about 50 minutes. In the evening at 7:40 PM, Chairman Wang specially hosted a banquet in the National Government Auditorium. The ministers and officials of the National Government all attended the reception. General Commander Hata, Ambassador Shigemitsu, and General Okamura, the highest commander of the Japanese army in North China, were all invited to accompany the guests. More than a hundred guests and hosts were present, gathering together in a grand scene. After the banquet began, Chairman Wang immediately delivered a welcome speech, expressing the determination and enthusiasm of China from top to bottom to cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War, and mutually wished the entire audience the victory of the Greater East Asia War. Prime Minister Tojo also sincerely delivered a reply speech, stating his respect for China's participation in the war and wishing prosperity to the Sino-Japanese national fortunes. Then, the meal began, and the guests and hosts talked very happily until 10:15 PM when this grand and historic feast began to end. After the banquet, Prime Minister Tojo returned to the Yingbin House to rest. The next day, the 14th, Prime Minister Tojo got up at dawn. Although he had a long journey and many social engagements, he was full of energy and did not show any fatigue. At 9:20 AM, Ambassador Shigemitsu specially went to pay his respects. At 9:30 AM, Chairman Wang specially accompanied Chen Gongbo, President of the Legislative Yuan, and Zhou Fohai, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, to visit the Yingbin House in return.

<h3>Summary of Chairman Wang's Speech</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th, Central News Agency telegram: Chairman Wang's speech at the banquet in honor of Prime Minister Tojo was as follows: In the great era of the Greater East Asia War, Prime Minister Tojo bears extremely heavy responsibilities and is truly busy day and night. However, he took the time to visit us in person, which is deeply comforting in terms of Sino-Japanese friendly relations, especially in terms of the Sino-Japanese relationship of sharing weal and woe, living and dying together in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Recalling my visit to Tokyo in December last year, I received various clear instructions from Prime Minister Tojo regarding the future of the Greater East Asia War. He also understood and provided great assistance to the enthusiasm and determination of the Chinese National Government and the people to participate in the Greater East Asia War, which gave the National Government and the people boundless courage. The measures taken on January 9 this year to return the concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights fulfilled the long-cherished wish of the Chinese people, both in and out of government, for decades. It fulfilled Japan's promise to assist China in completing the conditions necessary to become an independent country. This great assistance is not only unforgettable to China, but also opened a new epoch in East Asia. All East Asian compatriots will never forget it.</p>
<p>Since participating in the Greater East Asia War, China has increasingly encouraged itself in its determination and increasingly sought to exert its ability to share the responsibilities that it should bear. However, while having this firm determination and position, we also deeply feel the inadequacy of our national strength and people's strength, fearing that we cannot contribute to the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, we only seek to make rapid progress, and in these two months and more, we have worked diligently and dared not slacken in the slightest. Thanks to the various good intentions and assistance of the ambassadors and generals of friendly nations, we have fortunately gained a foundation for progress. Today, Prime Minister Tojo has graced us with his presence, and we hope that he will not hesitate to give us guidance. Now, I would like to offer a toast with all sincerity, wishing Prime Minister Tojo good health and the ultimate victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Summary of Prime Minister Tojo's Reply Speech</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th, Central News Agency telegram: After Chairman Wang delivered a welcome speech at the banquet in honor of Prime Minister Tojo, Prime Minister Tojo immediately delivered a reply speech, which roughly stated: This visit to your country is to return the visit of Chairman Wang to our country at the end of last year, and to express respect for your country's resolute declaration of war against the common enemy of Greater East Asia, Britain and the United States, on January 9 this year. Also, to have frank talks with Chairman Wang and various dignitaries of your country on the strategies to complete the common war. Although my stay in your country is extremely short, I have witnessed that under the leadership of Chairman Wang, your country, from top to bottom, is working together in unity and has already reaped great results, which is deeply touching. I express my utmost respect for the concerted efforts of your country. Your country has made great progress since declaring war, and at the same time has contributed greatly to the Greater East Asia War, which is sincerely appreciated by our country. Therefore, our country, based on the fundamental spirit of cooperation between our two countries, has worked hard to establish a relationship between our two countries that is adapted to the new era, and is determined to re-consider according to the spirit of the established agreements in order to adapt to the future development of the relationship between our two countries. Today, our country's troops have completely destroyed the bases of Britain, America, and Holland in various parts of Greater East Asia, and laid the foundation for certain victory and invincibility. We will continue to carry out vigorous operations. At the same time, the development of Manchuria is steadily progressing, and the connection between China, Japan, and Manchuria is also becoming closer. Your country has made great contributions to completing the war, and Burma is about to obtain the honor of independence based on mutual assistance. At the same time, Germany and Italy, our allies in Europe, are also increasingly high-spirited and are preparing to launch large-scale offensives in the future. It is deeply gratifying that the allied countries are cooperating with each other and that the future is infinitely bright, working hard to overcome difficulties and defeat Britain and the United States. Here, I would like to reiterate our country's determination, that is, our country is determined to work closely with the allied countries to strengthen our combat power, severely attack Britain and the United States, strive for final victory, build a new Greater East Asia, and contribute to the construction of a new world order. At the same time, I would like to express my respect for your country's great efforts under the leadership of Chairman Wang to work together and complete the Greater East Asia War. I wish Chairman Wang good health and your country prosperous national fortunes.</p>

<h3>Hosting a Japanese Military and Civilian Discussion: Earnestly Emphasizing the Importance of Shanghai's Current Status: Making it a True Sino-Japanese Cooperation Zone</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Shanghai News: Prime Minister Tojo of Japan arrived in Shanghai at 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 14th. At 7:30 PM on the afternoon of the 14th, he invited Shimomura, the highest commander of the Japanese army in the Shanghai area, Nagatsu, the commander of the Shanghai army, Minister Tajiri, and many other military officers and civilians to a certain mansion for a discussion. Prime Minister Tojo's speech was roughly as follows:</p>
<p>I am very grateful to be able to take this opportunity to invite you and all the military officers and civilian dignitaries, who have all attended. I am deeply grateful for your tireless efforts here day and night. I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks. The purpose of my visit to China this time is to thank Chairman for visiting the Empire at the end of last year, and at the same time to personally express my respect to the Republic of China for resolutely declaring war against Britain and the United States, the common enemy of Greater East Asia, on January 9 this year. In order to complete the common war, I have had frank talks with the dignitaries of the National Government, and I have also investigated the actual situation of the army, navy, and other agencies in China and personally rewarded their hard work. At the same time, I inspected the implementation of the fundamental policy towards China decided by His Majesty the Emperor some time ago. In Nanjing, I held cordial talks with Chairman and other dignitaries. As a result, we reached a complete consensus on the strategies for completing the common war. The cooperation and coordination between the two countries in military, political, and economic matters are becoming closer, which is extremely gratifying.</p>
<p>Although my stay this time is temporary, I am deeply impressed by the way you and everyone have fully overcome various difficulties and worked hard to complete your tasks. Regarding the policy towards China this time, Shanghai's status is extremely important. All the handling of local affairs is attracting the attention of everyone. I firmly believe that we must quickly wipe out the colors of Britain and the United States and build a true Sino-Japanese cooperation zone here. This is the most urgent thing now. I believe that we must fully respect the responsibility and creativity of the Chinese side at any time and in any place to handle the above-mentioned issues in order to ensure true cooperation in the war, especially in the economic aspect. Only after the national policy is changed can we seek to realize it concretely, and we hope for the cooperation of the people. This turning point in national policy has a profound impact on the people standing on the front line, and there is a tendency to put them in a difficult position. The government, at the time of this major shift in policy towards China, also deeply sympathizes with the position of the overseas Chinese residing in China and is fully considering its follow-up measures.</p>
<p>However, if there are those who have oppressed and exploited the Chinese side based on personal desires in the past, they must be resolutely rectified, otherwise, the results of this fundamental policy cannot be expected. The government will consistently adhere to its original intention from beginning to end regarding the purpose and implementation of this fundamental policy and is determined to achieve its goals. However, the realization of the national policy must depend on the strength of you and everyone. We earnestly hope that the military and civilians will cooperate and work together in the future.</p>

<h3>Prime Minister Tojo Returns Home: Chairman Wang Issues Statement, Comprehensively Answering Questions from Chinese and Foreign Journalists</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) – Chairman Wang met with Chinese and foreign journalists today, comprehensively answering questions raised by the reporters. The main points of the conversation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo's return visit to China this time, including two meetings, has brought immense joy. I have just received a telegram informing me that he safely arrived back in Fukuoka today. Prime Minister Tojo bears the major responsibility of strategizing and commanding the Greater East Asia War. I am extremely grateful that he took the time to visit China amidst his busy schedule.</p>
<p>Last December, I met with Prime Minister Tojo in Tokyo. Prime Minister Tojo expressed a firm and clear vision for the future of the Greater East Asia War. Every word and sentence was deeply imprinted in my mind. Two months later, the development of the war situation has become even clearer, and Prime Minister Tojo's repeated statements have become even more detailed. I deeply admire Prime Minister Tojo's belief in the inevitable victory in the Greater East Asia War and his great enthusiasm for the construction of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and the independence and liberation of India, Burma, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, China has constantly been torn between two feelings. On the one hand, we are keenly aware of our weak national strength and fear that we cannot contribute to the Greater East Asia War. On the other hand, we deeply believe in the righteousness of the cause and feel that we cannot fulfill our responsibility as a member of East Asia without participating in the war. These two feelings have been understood by the governments and people of friendly nations, who have not hesitated to provide assistance. Having understood China's position and determination and agreeing to our participation in the war, they have clearly recognized China's current situation and needs, and have helped us strengthen our political, economic, and military capabilities. Since our participation in the war on January 9th, we have repeatedly received various forms of assistance from friendly nations. This time, Prime Minister Tojo personally visited China and treated us with sincerity. I firmly believe that the Chinese people will be even more united for China, for Sino-Japanese relations, and for the collective unity of East Asia. Our belief in the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War will be even more steadfast, and our efforts in participating in the war will be even more vigorous.</p>
<p>Some of you reporters have asked about the wartime system and our policies towards Chongqing. After participating in the war, the National Government immediately established the Supreme National Defense Council, reformed the central and local administrative organizations, and successively held various national conferences, such as the National Conference of Local Chiefs, the National Judicial Administration Conference, the New National Movement Promotion Conference, the National Military Conference, the National Economic Conference, the National Education Administration Conference, and the plenary session of the Chinese Nationalist Party. All of these were aimed at establishing a wartime system, concentrating national spirit and strength, and contributing even more to total war participation. As for the policies towards Chongqing, I believe that the most important thing is to grasp the hearts of the people. We have a firm belief in this. Since the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, we have followed the teachings of the Founding Father on Pan-Asianism and have taken preventative measures regarding Sino-Japanese relations before the incident, striving to prevent the incident from happening. After the incident, we have taken remedial measures, and even if the incident unfortunately occurred, we must seize the opportunity and quickly seek reconciliation. This is our fundamental view on the Sino-Japanese Incident. As for the Greater East Asia War, we believe that it is a necessary struggle for China's freedom and equality and for the liberation of East Asia, and it is also the original goal of the National Revolution. In this, China has no choice but to stand on the same front as our friendly nation, Japan, and advance towards the great path of Pan-Asianism without hesitation. Chiang Kai-shek's views are completely the opposite. Pan-Asianism has long been forgotten. He advocates resistance to the end against Japan and willingly serves as a detachment for the United Kingdom and the United States. Sino-Japanese cooperation has been sabotaged, and the nation's vitality has been devastated. Since our views are fundamentally opposed, the people's support will naturally be determined as facts progress. Therefore, the National Government's policies today are not directed at Chongqing but at the hearts of the people. I know that all the people of the country hope for an early end to the war and an early realization of peace. Those who hesitate are only concerned about whether peace can be achieved. If the peace proposals can be gradually realized, if the Sino-Japanese cooperation policy is implemented one by one, and if China's freedom and equality and East Asia's co-existence and co-prosperity can be truly achieved, then the people in Chongqing will definitely oppose resistance and lean towards peace. It can be asserted that the collapse of Chongqing can be awaited once the people's support is determined. The people's hearts may seem invisible, but they are actually tangible and can be seen everywhere. For example, on the tenth of this month, the anniversary of the Japanese Army, the troops of our friendly nation held a defense exercise. Students from the Central Military Academy enthusiastically participated. On that day, tens of thousands of people from the capital came out to watch, filling the mountains and valleys with enthusiastic emotions, far surpassing the past when people would hide at home at the sound of gunfire. From this, it can be seen that since our participation in the war, the general public has universally recognized the significance of the Greater East Asia War and has deeply understood Sino-Japanese relations. Their enthusiasm for the progress of the current situation is shared. It can also be seen that the spirit of the two countries, China and Japan, moving from sharing joys and sorrows to sharing life and death in the Greater East Asia War has been gradually popularized through your publicity efforts. A movement is only concerned that the spirit of the people has not yet been awakened, and there is nothing to start with. Once the spirit of the people has been awakened, it will inevitably generate a powerful force. I have silently observed the progress of the peace movement and the current sentiments of the Chinese people, and I am deeply optimistic about the future of Sino-Japanese cooperation and the Greater East Asia War. Today, on the day that Prime Minister Tojo, who has made a historically significant return visit, safely returns to our friendly nation, I meet with you all and wish you the greatest congratulations and encouragement for our common future.</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Tojo Returns to Fukuoka, Issues Important Statement: Honest Talks Held with Key Figures of the National Government, China and Japan Moving Forward in Unified Step</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – Prime Minister Tojo, accompanied by Military Affairs Bureau Chief Sato and other staff members, departed from Tokyo on the 12th to visit Nanjing, the capital of China, and after meeting with Chairman Wang of the National Government, returned to Fukuoka by plane at noon on the 15th. The Cabinet Information Bureau issued the following statement regarding this matter:</p>
<p>"Prime Minister Tojo, concurrently serving as Minister of the Army, made a return visit to Chairman Wang of the Chinese National Government in response to his visit to Japan at the end of last year. He also expressed his respect for the Republic of China's declaration of war against the United Kingdom and the United States. Furthermore, he held frank discussions with the leaders of the National Government regarding the completion of the common war and inspected various institutions. He departed from Tokyo on March 12th, visited Nanjing, and then traveled to Shanghai before returning home on the 15th."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – According to a Fukuoka telephone report, Prime Minister Tojo issued a statement upon his return from his visit to China, stating in essence that he had long desired to visit the Republic of China. This visit was to reciprocate the visit of Chairman Wang of the National Government to Japan at the end of last year and to express respect for the National Government's participation in the war. He also held honest talks with the leaders of national defense regarding strategies for completing the common war. Although the duration was extremely short, he was deeply gratified to have fulfilled this long-cherished wish. Since the Republic of China declared war against the United Kingdom and the United States, it has been developing steadily towards autonomy and independence as one of the nations of Greater East Asia. The Empire sincerely hopes that the National Government's efforts will contribute to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, to adapt to the new situation, a new direction has been decided to establish Sino-Japanese relations, namely, to return all exclusive concessions managed by the Empire in China, to recognize China's recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession, the Xiamen Public Concession, and the Beijing Legation Quarter, and to abolish extraterritorial rights. In addition, various benevolent measures will be taken to handle enemy property in China. All of this work is currently being carried out continuously. In the future, the Empire will further adapt to the development of Sino-Japanese relations and will resolve to reconsider existing treaties based on the same spirit. During this visit to the Republic of China, I personally witnessed the reality of China's participation in the war and held frank discussions with key figures of the National Government. It goes without saying that Chairman Wang and other leaders of the National Government, as well as the general Chinese people, unanimously resonated with the sincerity of the Empire. Therefore, their determination to share joys and sorrows and share life and death with the Empire in the capacity of a fellow nation of Greater East Asia is extremely firm. I am deeply excited by the current situation in which China and Japan treat each other with sincerity. Moreover, the Empire has always been a nation of good faith. Now, at a time of great transformation in the world, the Empire's fundamental policy towards China, which has been decided for the construction of a new Greater East Asia, will be realized one after another as the war situation progresses. The Empire has established a solid foundation for inevitable victory and invincibility. The war situation is progressing in a situation favorable to us, and the ultimate victory will be obtained without a doubt. I am confident that the Chinese people, understanding the new state of Sino-Japanese relations, will gladly move forward in unified step with us under the leadership of Chairman Wang. Furthermore, I am deeply grateful for the valiant and courageous fighting of the Japanese army in China, and I hereby express my gratitude. I express my respect for the hard work of the imperial military, government officials, and civilians in China. As for the Japanese expatriates in China, I cannot help but deeply sympathize with them due to the various complexities and difficulties involved in the implementation of the new policies. We will, of course, make the most complete consideration for aftercare in the future.</p>

<h3>Chairman Wang Hosts a Banquet for Ambassador Arita</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) – Mr. Kenkichi Arita, the Japanese Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Vietnam, arrived in Nanjing at 2:20 p.m. on the 14th and immediately visited Ambassador Shigemitsu and others for discussions.

<h3>Japanese Youth Delegation Established to Visit China</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Youth Corps has decided to send representatives to Nanjing to participate in the celebration of the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, in order to promote cooperation between Chinese and Japanese youth. The selection of representatives, consisting of twenty male and female representatives from various prefectures throughout Japan, has already been completed. Today, at 12:30 p.m., a ceremony was held at the Japan Youth Hall here to establish the "Youth Corps China Celebration Delegation." Training will be conducted at the headquarters from the 16th to the 21st of this month, and the delegation is scheduled to arrive in Nanjing before the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital on the 30th of this month.</p>
<h3>Air Battle Occurs on the India-Burma Border</h3>
<p>Japanese Air Force Base in Burma, 15th (Domei News Agency) – Yesterday afternoon, Japanese army aircraft engaged ten enemy fighters and three bombers in the skies over Maungdaw on the India-Burma border. Four enemy fighters and one bomber were shot down. There were no losses on the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>U.S. Air Forces in Chongqing and India Become Independent</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 15th (Central News Agency) – In order to reorganize the command system and alleviate internal conflicts, the U.S. Air Force authorities have separated the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing and the U.S. Air Force stationed in India, allowing them to operate independently. According to a New Delhi dispatch, when Major General Bissell, commander of the U.S. Air Force in India, met with reporters on the 13th, he answered questions regarding the independence of the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing, stating that the Tenth Air Force unit under his command in India would do its utmost to cooperate with the Fourteenth Air Force unit and would maintain unified cooperative operations under the command of General Stilwell. However, he avoided mentioning any discord between him and Major General Chennault, commander of the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing, and only stated that the Tenth Air Force unit had been working hard for the anti-Axis coalition since its deployment in India and had made great contributions to the transportation of the Chongqing-India route. Because his remarks made no mention of the activities of the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing, it sparked another dispute. The Chongqing Ta Kung Pao published a commentary on the 13th stating in essence that the separation and independence of the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing and the U.S. Air Force in India was a concrete measure taken by Roosevelt to emphasize the East Asian front and to strictly order direct attacks on Japan. Therefore, this measure is of great significance for the defense of Chongqing and the counterattack against Japan. The newspaper also emphasized the need for the Chongqing Air Force to obtain close cooperation with the U.S. Air Force and subtly satirized the past lack of cooperation between the two sides, saying that the U.S. Air Force would surely exert more effort in the future.</p>
<h3>U.S. Plans to Establish Information Branch in Moscow</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 15th (Domei News Agency) – According to a Washington dispatch, the U.S. government is planning to establish a wartime information bureau branch in Moscow and is currently negotiating with the Soviet government. However, the Soviet government has not yet set a precedent for allowing other countries to establish propaganda organizations within its territory.</p>
<h3>Regulations on Rice Transportation and Sales in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces to be Followed According to Proclamation by Japanese Military Authorities</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) – The "Provisional Regulations for the Control of Wartime Material Movement" previously promulgated by the National Government will be implemented from the 16th of this month. All old laws and regulations previously implemented in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces will be abolished. In order to avoid obstacles in the purchase of rice, the National Government promulgated the "Provisional Regulations for the Management of Rice Transportation and Sales in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces" on the 12th, stipulating that it would be implemented immediately. The General Headquarters of the Japanese Expeditionary Force to China, the Headquarters of the Japanese Fleet in China, and the Japanese Embassy in China also issued a joint proclamation on the 15th for the purpose of comprehensive cooperation, clarifying that the movement of rice in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions should be handled in accordance with the "Provisional Regulations for the Management of Rice Transportation and Sales in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces" promulgated by the National Government on March 12th.</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Tojo's Visit to China Has Great Significance</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) – Since Chairman Wang of the National Government visited Japan last December, Prime Minister Tojo's return visit to China this time, within a period of less than three months, is a major turning point with epoch-making progress in the history of Sino-Japanese relations. During this period, Japan's policy towards China has undergone new developments. Due to our country's participation in the war, both China and Japan have successively implemented many highly important policies. China and Japan have become completely unified in order to achieve the supreme common goal of completing the Greater East Asia War, preparing to destroy the United Kingdom and the United States in an invincible posture. Today, Prime Minister Tojo personally returned a visit to our nation's capital and paid respects to Chairman Wang, strengthening the determination to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This has great significance in the joint completion of the war. In the future, China will strengthen the National Government with Japan's unchanging attitude as its background and will advance towards the path of self-improvement with even greater efforts. Looking back, since Japan and the National Government established an eternally unchanging relationship with the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty as the cornerstone, the relationship between the two countries has gradually progressed. Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government's policy goals were peace and nation-building, but the influence of the United Kingdom and the United States had not been completely eliminated, and the goal of cooperative warfare was inevitably somewhat vague. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, our country's war goals have become clear. In particular, since the visit of the three special envoys, Japan's Hiranuma, Arita, and Nagai, to our country last September, there has been a tremendous impact on promoting a high degree of cooperation between the two countries. At that time, the National Government expressed unofficially its intention to voluntarily participate in the war and presented active opinions on the specific tasks that should be undertaken and how they should be practiced in the construction of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The National Government's sincerity in embracing cooperative warfare was conveyed to the Japanese side by the special envoys. In order to actively promote construction policies in the entire East Asian region, Japan established the Ministry of Greater East Asia last November. The importance of Japan's policy towards China has been emphasized by all parties. As a result, a broad policy was decided on implementing the outline of policies towards China. In December, a conference of Japanese ambassadors and consuls in China was convened to implement the policies of the Japanese central government. At this time, the National Government also reorganized its domestic institutions to adapt to the development of this new situation. Prime Minister Tojo of Japan, responding to the wishes of both parties, had the intention of visiting China last December, but ultimately could not realize it due to his busy political affairs. Subsequently, there was Chairman Wang's visit to Japan. Due to Chairman Wang's visit to Japan, the progress of Japan's policy towards China became concrete. On January 9th of this year, the National Government announced its participation in the war, and Sino-Japanese relations entered a new stage. The National Government's wartime Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration clearly clarified the integrated relationship between the two countries to both domestic and foreign audiences. Based on this national policy, Japan also returned concessions, abolished extraterritorial rights, and transferred enemy property. With our country as the main entity, it established economic control institutions and made great efforts in various aspects to strengthen the cooperative National Government. We are deeply grateful for Japan's friendly measures and are determined to cooperate with Japan to destroy the United Kingdom and the United States. In preparation for the wartime system, we first implemented a comprehensive reform of administrative institutions, followed by preparations in military and economic aspects for the wartime system. Up to today, Japan's wartime parliament has naturally adjourned. Prime Minister Tojo of Japan has made this special return visit to Chairman Wang in order to resolve pending issues between the two countries at once. Our country is deeply grateful for Japan's ethical diplomacy and deeply feels that the responsibility that China bears in completing the Greater East Asia War has become increasingly important. We are determined to reciprocate Japan's sincere attitude. As the third anniversary of the return to the capital approaches, the National Government is showing a surging momentum. In the future, the attitude of China and Japan completing the war as one entity will be further strengthened by Prime Minister Tojo's visit, and concrete progress can be expected.</p>
<h3>Ukraine's Door Closed: German Forces Reoccupy Kharkov City, Soviet Forces on Central Front Continuously Increase Pressure</h3>
<p>German Supreme Headquarters, 15th (Haitong News Agency) – The German Supreme Headquarters issued a special war report last night stating that the German counteroffensive on the southern front has driven the Soviet forces across the Donets River. After weeks of fierce fighting, an important victory has been achieved today. German advancing troops, with the assistance of the Air Force, encircled Kharkov from the northeast and reoccupied the city. The enemy lost countless soldiers and war materiel.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Haitong News Agency) – Responsible sources here stated that German forces and Waffen-SS troops, led by General Hoth, are continuing their offensive in the Kharkov region. Soviet forces are using fresh troops west of Belgorod in an attempt to stop the German advance, but they have been repulsed.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 15th (Haitong News Agency) – According to recent reports, when German forces attacked Kharkov, a large number of aircraft provided air support. At that time, two Soviet artillery positions were guarding the two main roads leading to the city center. One hundred German dive bombers first thoroughly destroyed the enemy's artillery, and the infantry, losing the cover of artillery, had to quickly retreat.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Haitong News Agency) – A Haitong News Agency military correspondent stated that the German occupation of Kharkov is the prelude to a large-scale German counteroffensive on the southern front of the Eastern Front. About a month ago, German forces withdrew from Kharkov according to plan, and Soviet forces entered the city. At that time, the Soviet headquarters said that the door to Ukraine had now been opened. Now that German forces have reoccupied the city, they have closed this door again. Kharkov is an important transportation center between the Donets Basin and the Orel region. The strategic importance of the German forces reoccupying the city is self-evident.</p>
<p>Soviet border area, 15th (Havas News Agency) – The most noteworthy event on the Eastern Front today is the battle for Kharkov City. Over the past 24 hours, German and Soviet forces have engaged in the most intense battle near Kharkov City, especially in the northern part of the city. Although the Soviet Union has not acknowledged the German occupation of Kharkov City, it has not denied it either, only stating that "the enemy forces are numerous, far exceeding the Red Army, and our army is currently fighting hard to resist the strong enemy." According to Soviet official statements, German infantry, under the cover of 100 tanks, has broken through the Red Army's defense line in the southern suburbs of Kharkov City. The success of this German offensive should be attributed to the German Air Force. The weather in the front line is clear and favorable for air operations, and German aircraft groups have the advantage in both quantity and strategy. The German occupation of the city is quite important. German forces are currently advancing along the Kharkov-Kursk railway towards Belgorod, cutting off General Golikov's forces. However, the Red Army on the central front continues to apply pressure. General Timoshenko's forces, which departed from Vyazma, have reached the upper reaches of the Dnieper River near Dorogobuzh. Another Red Army force, led by General Shakhurin, is advancing along the Vyazma-Bryansk railway and continues to make progress. It is reported to have occupied Milietinon. In addition, in the Orel area, the Red Army is continuing to attack the city and attempting to advance into Bryansk, but it is being blocked by German forces.</p>

Secretary of State Hull will also participate in the talks after returning from vacation.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Domei News Agency) – According to a Washington dispatch, British Foreign Secretary Eden visited President Roosevelt at the White House on the evening of the 13th for dinner and discussions. Eden also met separately with the ambassadors of Australia, New Zealand, and the South African Union to the United States in the afternoon.

<p>Zurich, 14th (Havas News Agency) – London attaches great importance to British Foreign Secretary Eden's trip to Washington. It is said that Foreign Secretary Eden will try to resolve some important issues between the United Kingdom and the United States. First, Eden will declare to the U.S. government that the British government finds it difficult to agree with the proposal by some people in Washington to establish an international committee to manage the administration of all colonies. In other words, any suggestion that conflicts with Britain's sovereignty over its territories and occupied territories during the war will be difficult to accept. Second, on the Indian issue, Eden will have the U.S. authorities accept the tough policies adopted by the British government. Third, the Chongqing government will require Britain to return Hong Kong. This request may have been backed by the United States, but it has not yet been approved by the British cabinet. Fourth, the dispute between the French rebel generals Giraud and de Gaulle, which is still unresolved, will also be discussed. Fifth, the Soviet Union's territorial demands in Europe are the most important. It is said that the United States has a rather lenient attitude towards them, while the United Kingdom is strongly opposed.</p>

He stated, "Our reason for urging the immediate opening of a second battlefield is not entirely to help the Soviet Union, but actually to implement policies related to the safety of the British people. There is currently a movement aimed at making the British people believe that the Soviet Union is capable of winning alone, but it is also a fact that the Soviet Union cannot win for Britain." After Hall's speech, the assembly unanimously resolved to demand the immediate opening of a second battlefield.</p>

<h3>National Chamber of Commerce Control Association Held Inaugural Meeting Yesterday; Over 300 Chinese and Japanese Business Guests Attended; Minister Mei and Mayor Chen Personally Delivered Admonitory Speeches</h3>
<p>The National Chamber of Commerce Control Association held its inaugural meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 15th) on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel. In addition to all the directors and supervisors, a total of over 300 Chinese and Japanese officials and guests from the Chinese and Japanese financial and business communities attended. After performing the rituals, Chairman Shoumin delivered the opening remarks, followed by admonitory speeches by Minister Mei of the Ministry of Industry, Mayor Chen, and Xiangdai. Guests included Xu Jianping, Chinese Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Aoki, Chairman of the Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who delivered congratulatory speeches. Finally, Wen Lantian, Director of the Salt Affairs, delivered a thank-you speech. The ceremony concluded around 7:00 PM. The ceremony was simple and solemn. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Guests</p>
<p>The guests attending the meeting included Mayor Chen Gongbo on the Chinese side, Wang Zhigang, Director of the Economic Bureau, Yuan Houzhi, Lu Ying, Pan Da, and the heads of various bureaus of the municipal government, Feng Jie, the director of the Propaganda Department's Shanghai office, and representatives from the financial and business communities, including Qi Runxiang, Pei Yunqing, Wang Boyuan, Huang Jiangquan, Jin Zongcheng, Hu Guigeng, Zhu Miaosheng, and Tang Xinghai. On the side of Allied nations, the guests included Minister Horiuchi, Minister Tajiri, Aoki Setsu, Kurimoto Toraji, Komuro Takeo, Kawaguchi Ken, Yamamoto Takeo, Tei Ko, Kimura Masutaro, and Fukuda Kou, Inagaki Noboru, the Director of the Material Control Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Guo Hong, Chen Zhong, Xiang Xun, Sun Zuji, and Zhang Jun, the directors of various bureaus of the Ministry of Industry, all attended the meeting. Minister Mei of the Ministry of Industry personally attended the meeting to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Speech by Director Tang</p>
<p>Tang Shoumin, the director of the National Chamber of Commerce Control Association, delivered the opening remarks, saying, "Material control is extremely important for people's livelihood, especially during wartime when production is insufficient. If we want to stabilize people's lives and maintain social order, material control is absolutely necessary. Japan and Germany were the first countries to implement material control, and their methods are the most complete. The effectiveness of their systems has long been recognized by the world and does not need to be elaborated upon.</p>
<p>Hoping for Sincere Cooperation from All Parties</p>
<p>Our country's material control work was originally handled by various agencies of Allied nations. Now, the authorities of Allied nations, in the spirit of cooperation, and with great enthusiasm and determination, have returned the task of material control to our country to handle ourselves, while still providing assistance at any time to promote its success. The government, fearing that having the government handle it directly would create a disconnect with commercial realities, transferred the responsibility to an economically autonomous group to manage, with the government maintaining a supervisory and guidance role while promulgating laws and regulations. The thoughtfulness of the authorities of both countries regarding the people's livelihood is appreciated by all the people. Considering the nature of this association, it belongs to a group organization of trade associations. According to the organizational procedure, we should have started from the lower levels. However, due to time constraints, we are simultaneously having the government appoint personnel to organize the general association and strengthen trade organizations to ensure that material control work is not disrupted. This was originally a temporary expedient measure, but the members of the general association are still members of trade associations. Although the method is a variation, the spirit remains. However, I still hope that we can strengthen the trade associations in various regions according to the original organizational procedure, so that the establishment of the general association can conform to the true spirit of collective autonomy, and the progress of control work can become smoother and more efficient. Control methods are still a pioneering effort in our country. Many conditions are not yet in place, and reference materials are still lacking. The various difficulties in implementation are inherent. The most difficult of these is that the nature of control policies is completely opposite to that of free economic policies, and free economic policies have long been deeply rooted in China. Once the policy is shifted, not only will the commercial sector feel inconvenience, but consumers will also inevitably feel constrained and restricted. However, we must recognize that control methods are, first, favored by the world trend, and second, are the basis of national policy. At this critical juncture for people's livelihood that needs to be resolved urgently, there is no other way but to pool our efforts, abandon selfish views, and jointly promote national policy to achieve the goal of the greater good. The organization of this general association was extremely hasty. Those who were appointed had no choice but to step forward and take on the responsibility. How to make the organization of this association more sound still requires a long period of research and consideration, and gradual improvement based on practical experience. In the early stages, there will inevitably be many unsatisfactory aspects. Even I have the same feeling. I hope that government officials, Allied authorities, and people from all walks of life in China and Japan will understand, sympathize, provide guidance and assistance, especially hoping that the heads of various agencies of Allied nations, and agencies at all levels from top to bottom, will provide significant assistance in the spirit of cooperation. Secondly, I hope that various commercial organizations of Allied nations will cooperate sincerely according to the principle of equality agreed upon by the authorities of both countries. In the future, there may be situations where the implementation of laws and regulations may not fully meet the wishes of individual businesses. In such cases, please give special understanding.</p>
<p>Assuming Responsibility for the Greater Good</p>
<p>As for Shoumin personally, I am a businessman. This time, in the capacity of a trade association, I have been appointed by the government to take on this difficult and pioneering work. I originally did not dare to accept. Moreover, I have little research on control issues, lack knowledge, and even less experience. I am in no way qualified to undertake this task. The inadequacy of my spirit, the outdatedness of my thinking, and the inability to divide myself from my own business are even more secondary matters. However, because I believe that implementing autonomous control is related to national policy, and that the current problem of people's livelihood is serious and needs to be resolved rationally, and because the government officials have earnestly encouraged me and charged me with the greater good, I have no choice but to forget my inadequacies and temporarily assume responsibility, waiting for the government officials to calmly seek out virtuous and capable individuals. I hope that the government officials will fulfill this promise and find other capable individuals as soon as possible, so as not to delay the advancement of the country's major policies and to prevent myself from incurring blame. However, since I am a member of the trade association, I will never stand idly by, and I will still contribute my opinions at any time for the government and this association to consider and adopt.</p>
<p>Increase Production and Stabilize Currency</p>
<p>Moreover, I am naturally straightforward. I always seek to be practical in everything I undertake and will never do things perfunctorily. I will do what I can, and if I cannot do it, I will immediately resign. I have no other strengths, but I am courageous in advancing and retreating. Being courageous in advancing means wanting to fulfill my responsibilities, and being courageous in retreating means not wanting to be a mere figurehead. I always encourage myself to be honest and upright. This is what I want to frankly report to you today. This association is a commercial and autonomous collective organization. If we want to complete our mission, we must fully develop the spirit of autonomy. How to develop the spirit of autonomy depends entirely on the unity and cooperation of leaders in various industries. It cannot be accomplished by one person alone. How to promote perfection depends even more on the government having detailed regulations to facilitate implementation. If the association has any opinions, it will contribute them at any time, and I hope that the government will consider and adopt them to comply with public sentiment. Controlled purchase and distribution are only one part of the control work. The important key still lies in increasing production, and increasing production depends even more on financial regulation and currency stability. I hope that government officials will pay special attention to these points to coordinate with the work of this association.</p>
<p>Finally, I would still like to repeat and solemnly declare that since this association was established in a hurry, my colleagues have little research and experience in material control work. It is expected that the handling will not be perfect. I hope that people from all walks of life will not have excessive expectations. My colleagues and I will also strive to move forward under the principles of fairness, frankness, integrity, and credibility, so as not to fail the expectations of society for this association. Please ask government officials, Allied authorities, business groups of both sides, and people from all walks of life to correct and guide us at any time. My colleagues and I are willing to accept it with great enthusiasm and respect."</p>
<p>Speech by Minister Mei</p>
<p>Minister Mei Siping of the Ministry of Industry stood up and delivered an admonitory speech on behalf of the government, saying that the National Chamber of Commerce Control Association was prepared and established in a short period of time. From the government's point of view, there are three reasons why this was necessary: (1) Although the candidates for the directors and supervisors of this Chamber of Commerce Control Association were appointed by the government, the standards for appointment were extremely objective. Those who serve as directors and supervisors have knowledge, experience, prestige, and ability. I am confident that the central organization is sufficient to meet the needs. As for the representatives of various industrial and commercial firms, because the investigation has not been completed, they could not be selected immediately. After the investigation is clear in the future, they will be gradually supplemented. This is due to the urgency of time, and I hope that the people in the industrial and commercial circles who participated in the inaugural meeting today will forgive us. (2) The government hopes that the establishment of the Chamber of Commerce Control Association will become the highest control organization in the national commerce, which can take into account both military needs at the front and people's livelihood in the rear. Military needs and people's livelihood are closely related. If people's livelihood in the rear is not prosperous, then the military needs at the front are in danger. If the military needs at the front are scarce, then people's livelihood in the rear will also be difficult to guarantee. As for the method of taking into account both military needs and people's livelihood, the first is to increase production and stabilize prices. I hope that the Chamber of Commerce Control Association can assist the government in implementing the policy of price management in the future, so that the two major problems of military needs and people's livelihood can be solved easily. (3) The organization of the Chamber of Commerce Control Association is an innovation in China and is also emerging in other countries. Whether it can implement its mission and promote control work in the future depends on the strength of the organization. However, control work relies solely on the strength of the government, which is really insufficient. We must concentrate the economic strength of the country to achieve the goal. At the same time, the control organization itself should give full play to the spirit of autonomy and integrate the strength of all aspects, so that the organization can be sound and the work can be successful. I am very honored to attend the establishment of the Chamber of Commerce Control Association today. The above three points are the government's policy, and I have to take this opportunity to tell you."</p>
<p>Speech by Mayor Chen</p>
<p>Mayor Chen said, "The establishment of the National Chamber of Commerce Control Association is something that we have been eagerly expecting to come true in our minds. This matter has been achieved through the efforts and promotion of both officials and businessmen. The directors and supervisors who have been honorably appointed have known each other for a long time, and they must have a thorough and full understanding of the significance of the association. Regarding future plans, it is not about what methods to use, but how to do it, because the methods already exist, and it is about how to do it and how to implement it. In the past, all parties complained about the control affairs because of their complexity and triviality. Due to my duties, I often summarized the opinions of various parties and conveyed them to Japanese officials and people from all walks of life. Although they all believe that the control work should be handled by the Chinese themselves, there are also concerns that the Chinese side may not have enough ability, and it is easy to cause abuses in the future. I believe that this kind of opinion of the Japanese side cannot be said to be completely unfounded, but I dare to guarantee that after the control affairs are handled by the Chinese themselves, the situation will not be worse than it is now. Now that the matter of self-handling of material control has been realized, it is indeed gratifying. What I fear is not being unable to do things, but having too many opinions, avoiding difficulties, and lacking a sense of responsibility. The situation in the past was like this. I hope that this kind of inferiority can be eliminated in the future, not being afraid of others' criticism, not being afraid of difficulties and hardships, and doing things practically. Now that free trade has been changed to a controlled economy, the people's psychology also needs to be corrected. The rise in prices is due to the "looking high" mentality. I hope to control others and let myself go, but since I have let myself go, how can I control others? The economic level is high if it is all high, and low if it is all low. There is no reason for this high and that low, this low and that high. Therefore, the people must eliminate the past "looking high" mentality. The price of goods should be based on cost and a reasonable profit should be determined. In the past, the citizens have criticized the municipal government for not thinking of a way, but in fact, there is no way to do it. Now that there is a National Chamber of Commerce Control Association, we must take the people's livelihood as the premise. If we can do it, we must do it. If we cannot do it, we must still do it. If we can only do it, then we do it. If we cannot do it, then we don't do it. I ask, who will do it? There is no easy task in the world, it is about measuring yourself. Doing things only seeks to be honest. It is fine to criticize or scold. On the day of the establishment of this Chamber of Commerce, I would like to encourage you with this word." Speech by Ambassador Horiuchi</p>
<p>Then, Minister Horiuchi gave a speech on behalf of Ambassador Eizo. Mr. Horiuchi came to Shanghai from Nanjing to attend the meeting. The summary of his speech is as follows: "The National Chamber of Commerce Control Association was established today. I came to Shanghai from Nanjing to attend the meeting and am very pleased. China and Japan share the basic spirit of national relations, sharing weal and woe. Sharing woe today will enable us to share weal in the future, and the economy can also have a solid position. Since the National Government participated in the war, Japan has decided to conduct the Greater East Asia War with the Chinese people. In order to respect China's sovereignty, Japan is determined to abolish extraterritoriality and return the concessions. The two countries have already agreed to formally implement this matter by the end of this month. I believe that the two major tasks of economic recovery and stabilizing people's livelihood, although directly related to China, are also of great concern to Japan. This matter is difficult to achieve without the operation of a formal control agency. China has always advocated a free economy, which is deeply rooted. Therefore, we must overcome various difficulties in the future in order to succeed. The control work was originally handled by the Japanese side, and now it is returned to China for self-defense. Some people may suspect that Japan will be happy to see China fail after handing over this matter to China, and will only fear its success. In fact, China and Japan are brotherly countries. The brother entrusts the matter to the younger brother, and they will naturally share weal and woe, and care about each other at all times. If it succeeds, they will be happy, and if it fails, they will be worried. Japanese officials all feel the same way. I hope that the Chamber of Commerce Control Association will work hard from now on. Ambassador Eizo was overjoyed after hearing about this matter and specially asked me to come to Shanghai to participate in the grand ceremony and give a speech on behalf of him. Please understand."</p>
<p>Summary of Speech by Minister Tajiri</p>
<p>Minister Tajiri said, "Today, the Japanese Chamber of Commerce Control Association held its inaugural ceremony. I am very happy to participate in this event. In the past, the economy of Shanghai and Central China had to be controlled due to military relations, so foreign trade was also virtually stagnated, and Shanghai became a consumer city. The establishment of the Chamber of Commerce Control Association will undoubtedly make a significant contribution to the economy of China, Japan, and Greater East Asia. Recently, China and Japan have had further cooperation. Today, the Japanese have two major feelings: (1) The establishment of the Chamber of Commerce Control Association is the prelude to the entire economic control. Now that the National Government has already participated in the war, it is even more urgent to control the economy. Japan will be able to provide the greatest possible assistance within the possible range. (2) In order to revitalize China's economy and welcome the current economic trend, the establishment of the Chamber of Commerce Control Association is extremely important. I hope that the parties concerned can work hard to achieve the ideal goal."</p>
<p>Thank-you Speech by Supervisor Wen</p>
<p>Finally, Xie Wenlan, the director of the Supervisory Committee of the General Assembly, delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of all the directors and supervisors, saying, "We are very grateful to the heads of the national government and the heads of allied countries for attending the meeting today. In the future, this association will work hard under the leadership of the heads of government, in accordance with the established policies, to complete the important mission."</p>

<h3>Japan's Wartime Insurance Law May Be Applicable to Central China</h3>
<p>Japan's Wartime Insurance Law (Note: Japan's Wartime Insurance Law stipulates that wartime insurance undertaken by various insurance companies, such as air raid risks and artillery fire risks, can apply for reinsurance from the state) has recently been learned to be possibly applicable to Central China. The Japanese Embassy Office has ordered the Shanghai Japanese Non-Life Insurance Association to submit an application. After receiving the order, the association conducted various investigations and is now drafting a submission, which will be submitted to the embassy in the next few days. The content of the submission is roughly that the assets of Japanese people in China and the assets of Chinese, Japanese, and Taiwanese consortiums can be protected by the Wartime Insurance Law.</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Dedicated to the National Chamber of Commerce Control Association</h3>
<p>After the establishment of the National Chamber of Commerce Control Association, how it will work hard to live up to the expectations of the government and the goodwill of allied nations has been briefly discussed yesterday. Here is another suggestion:</p>
<p>(1) Personnel should break the idea of ​​personal interests. Anything that only benefits a few people and makes it difficult for most people should be avoided as much as possible.</p>
<p>(2) To stabilize prices, it is best to make it impossible for black market prices to arise. The current official prices of goods should be calculated based on their cost, and scientifically increased, so that those who own materials will not hide them and not sell them. This is the initial method.</p>
<p>(3) The procedure for handling affairs should be simple and fast. It is hoped that the bad habits of the past officialdom will be washed away.</p>
<p>(4) It is best to obtain the cooperation of transportation, taxation, military, and police departments, and work together to promote the progress of affairs.</p>
<p>(5) It seems that the leaders of various industries and the mainstays of various trade associations should be recruited to serve as consultants, and to plan the most fair distribution and purchase as a whole.</p>
<p>(6) The three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, are the pilot areas. The urban commercial ports of these three provinces and two cities should designate local impartial persons to be responsible for presiding over and promoting the work.</p>
<p>In short, the two words "huge and difficult" are enough to describe the working state of the association. The hosts should carefully plan to live up to the government's main purpose of stepping up wartime production. They should also have perseverance and determination, endure hard work and complaints, avoid difficulties, break through emotions, and use the courage of 120,000 points to overcome this difficult and great task.</p>
<h3>Cotton Control Association: New Plan for Buying Cotton</h3>
<p>In order to promote the purchase of cotton, the authorities have formulated a new plan as follows: (1) When the local buying associations under the jurisdiction of the Central China Cotton Control Association buy cotton from cotton farmers, in addition to paying the price in cash, they will also issue exchange coupons for cotton yarn and other daily necessities according to the amount of cotton provided by each cotton farmer. (2) Cotton farmers who must obtain rations of daily necessities and hold the above-mentioned exchange coupons can purchase their required materials at the designated locations at the official prices. (3) In the first three months of implementing this plan, the materials allocated to cotton farmers will be limited to cotton yarn. After this period, it will be extended to cigarettes, firecrackers, candles, sugar, and other daily necessities.</p>

<h3>Sino-Japanese Business Bank Expands Operations and Adds Branches</h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Business Bank, located at 693 North Sichuan Road in this city, is a joint venture established by prominent figures in the Chinese and Japanese financial communities. It opened in September of last year and has been diligently serving the financial needs of Sino-Japanese industry and commerce. As a result, its business has flourished, with deposits increasing significantly. The bank handles loans cautiously, in accordance with government regulations and laws. Its remittance business is also quite good. It has been learned that, in order to expand its business and facilitate commerce for the public, the bank will move its head office to 371 Jiangxi Road (formerly the Jiangsu Bank) starting next month to conduct its business. The original location at 693 North Sichuan Road will be converted into a branch. It is reported that the bank, due to its expanded operations, lacks sufficient staff and therefore recruited more employees last month. After careful review, over forty individuals were deemed qualified and hired, and they have already begun working at the bank.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou New Tea Soon to Be on the Market</h3>
<p>High Costs and Difficulties in Achieving Abundant Production</p>
<p>Tea is one of China's special products, and this port has always been an important outlet for Chinese tea exports. However, since the incident [likely refers to the outbreak of war], exports have been halted, and goods from the production areas cannot easily reach Shanghai, resulting in a sharp decline in the local tea market. In the past year, demand has only come from local retail shops and a slight need from new pharmaceutical businesses. The source of tea has been primarily limited to Hangzhou, with occasional shipments from Ningbo, but in very small quantities. As Qingming Festival approaches, Hangzhou tea is entering the budding season, and new tea will soon be on the market. According to inquiries with tea merchants, tea production this year will be limited due to years of local unrest, rising living costs, and continuously increasing tea production costs. Therefore, abundant production is unlikely, and prices are not expected to stabilize.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Observations on the National Commercial Control Association</h3>
<p>Yesterday, The Times made the following observations on the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association: "The National Commercial Control Association provides civilian commercial organizations with a greater scope of activity to participate in the economic and industrial activities of the Central China region. From any perspective, the establishment of this organization can revive the economic prosperity of Central China and strengthen the Nanjing government's administrative power within the peaceful regions.</p>
<p>"According to the new regulations, the movement of goods in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which previously required permits issued by the Japanese military authorities, will now be issued by the Commercial Control Association. With the permission of the Association, the industrial and commercial sectors can move goods specified in the regulations from the Shanghai area to other peaceful areas, or from other peaceful areas to the Shanghai area. In this way, Shanghai's industry and commerce will surely benefit, thereby promoting the industrial revival of Shanghai and its neighboring areas.</p>
<p>"The Nanjing government is currently planning to establish economic bureaus in various provinces and cities, directly under the supervision of the Ministry of Industry, to be responsible for registering, supervising, and guiding various industrial and commercial organizations, and to promote the improvement of industrial and commercial enterprises, the revival of economic markets, and the adjustment of all commodity prices. These matters will be handled through the joint cooperation of the Economic Bureau and the National Commercial Control Association.</p>
<p>"From this, it can be seen that the scope of activity of the Commercial Control Association extends to all sectors of industry and commerce, and can serve as an intermediary liaison between the Nanjing government and the civilian economic sector. This measure can be truly called a necessary step to revive the Chinese economy, and the sincere cooperation of leaders in the Chinese banking and industrial and commercial sectors can become the guarantee of success for this plan. In the future, with the purchase of materials and the allocation of raw materials being controlled, the Nanjing government can witness the stability of national life, because without a stable national life, there can be no healthy economic development.</p>
<p>In the future, the responsibilities of leaders in the Chinese financial and industrial sectors will inevitably increase as they participate in the National Commercial Control Association. In any case, the foundation for cooperation between China and Japan and their people can now be established."</p>
<h3>Refusal of Passage for Uncertified Citizens in the City</h3>
<p>Regarding the period during which residents of the city are applying for residence certificates, after the Shanghai Municipal Police extended the deadline to the end of this month for the city center and the district police extended it to the end of June, citizens applying for certificates in the city center have been extremely crowded in recent days. To encourage citizens to quickly apply for certificates, the police sub-bureaus in Nanshi have been strictly checking at the borders of the French and Chinese concessions. All uncertified citizens are prohibited from passing for one hour, as a warning against negligence. It is reported that after the expiration of the period in the city center, the police will strictly enforce the refusal of passage for uncertified citizens. This matter concerns the vital interests of citizens, so please do not delay and cause obstacles to passage in the future, so that petty criminals can be prevented from mingling in, and the security of the city center can be further consolidated.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Group Matters Under the Jurisdiction of the Economic Bureau</h3>
<p>Industrial and commercial group matters in this city have always been under the jurisdiction of the Social Movement Committee of this city. Now that the Economic Bureau of this city has been established, in accordance with organizational regulations, matters relating to industrial and commercial groups should be under the jurisdiction of the Economic Bureau. The municipal government has already instructed the Economic Bureau and the Social Welfare Bureau to conduct the handover.</p>
<h3>Thirtieth Ration of Food Allotted Entirely as Whole Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, rice shops under contract with the Public Concession and the French Concession began to collect the purchase orders for the 30th ration of household food from the Municipal Council's rice and flour allocation office. These purchase orders were obtained by the rice industry association and then distributed to the contracted rice shops. Starting today, each rice shop will pay the Municipal Council according to the purchase order, and present the bill of lading to pick up the goods from the designated warehouse. The rice and flour will be sold starting from the 21st of this month, based on the rice and flour certificates. The effective period is until March 30th.</p>
<p>Quantity and Price</p>
<p>Yesterday, this reporter inquired with the rice industry and learned that the rice specified on the 30th purchase order is a single variety of whole rice, without the combination of broken rice, and is mostly white rice, with a small amount of brown rice. The flour is of two types: No. 2 flour and No. 3 flour. The quantity of whole rice and flour and the purchase price for each rice shop are the same as the previous period, so it is expected that the household ration for the next period will not change significantly, that is, 2.5 liters of rice, costing 6 yuan and 3 jiao, and a total of 1 jin and 12 liang of No. 2 and No. 3 flour, costing 3 yuan and 8 jiao and a half. However, the exact allocation quantity and price are subject to the official announcement of the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Delayed Distribution of Coarse Grains</p>
<p>As for the distribution of coarse grains, although it was scheduled to be distributed along with the 30th ration of household food, the purchase orders collected by the rice shops yesterday did not include coarse grains. It is feared that it may not be realized. The exact distribution date is subject to the announcement.</p>
<p>Rice Pickup Warehouses</p>
<p>The warehouses designated for rice pickup this period are (1) Yaxing Warehouse at 131 Suzhou Road, (2) Jardine Matheson Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession, (3) Mitsubishi Jiangxi Wharf at 65 the Bund in the French Concession. The warehouses designated for flour pickup are (1) China Industrial Warehouse at 1014 North Suzhou Road, (2) Bank of China Warehouse at 1040 North Suzhou Road. Each rice shop can pick up the goods before the 18th.</p>
<p>Restrictions on Transportation Permits</p>
<p>To prevent abuses, the Municipal Council's rice and flour allocation office has specified the following important items regarding the transportation permits issued to rice shops: "This permit is only valid for one use. If it is used twice, or used to transport rice that is not authorized by this permit, the Bureau will confiscate all the rice being transported without compensation."</p>
<h3>Celebration Tea Party at the Manchukuo Consulate General in Shanghai</h3>
<p>To celebrate the 11th anniversary of the founding of Manchukuo, the Manchukuo Consulate General in Shanghai held a tea party at the ballroom of the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road yesterday (the 15th) at 4 PM. Mayor Chen Gongbo, Secretary-General Zhao Zenyue, Director Ye Xuesong, and others from the municipal government attended.

The film program began with current affairs films, followed by "Defending the North," and ended with "The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." The event ended at 7 PM.</p>
<h3>Trade Associations Secretly Investigate Inventory: No Protection for Those Who Conceal</h3>
<p>In order to effectively suppress the sales prices of their respective members, the trade associations in the two concessions have been strictly investigating the inventory of their members recently. According to information obtained by a Datong News Agency reporter, the trade association authorities believe that members often intentionally underreport the quantity of their inventory, transferring part of the goods for private sale on the black market. Therefore, in order to prevent this malpractice, the investigation work has been intensified. Recently, secret investigations have been implemented. If any goods obtained from wholesalers are found to be hidden in secret locations, they will be confiscated in full. In addition to implementing secret investigations, each trade association has also issued a clear warning to its members in order to understand their inventory, stating that if any member is found to have deceived the authorities, the trade association will not provide protection, and will cancel their membership status and suspend the allocation of goods.</p>
<h3>Zhang Hongsheng's Appeal: Sentence Changed to Death Penalty; Jiang Yilong's Imprisonment for Fifteen Years</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the murder of Hua Liying, a star dancer at the MGM Ballroom, who was strangled to death on the night of November 12th last year at her residence at 74 Hengmao Lane, Baxianqiao, the Second Special Court prosecuted Zhang Hongsheng for the crimes of robbery and murder, sentencing him to 15 years of imprisonment for the crimes of murder and theft, and depriving him of his civil rights for 10 years. Jiang Yilong was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment for the same crimes, and deprived of his civil rights for 8 years. Subsequently, because the prosecutor and the French Concession authorities believed that the sentencing in the first instance was inappropriate, they appealed to the Third High Court. Zhang and Jiang also appealed at the same time. The case was heard by the High Court Collegial Panel on the 8th of this month. At that time, the French Concession authorities objected to the prosecutor's appeal as violating the agreement and not complying with the litigation procedure, and requested that it be rejected. The court ruled to reject the prosecutor's appeal and proceeded with the hearing. The French Concession authorities and the Zhang and Jiang appeals were declared closed, awaiting judgment. The judgment was announced yesterday afternoon, and the original judgment was revoked. Zhang Hongsheng was sentenced to death for joint robbery and intentional homicide, and deprived of his civil rights for life. Jiang Yilong was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment for the same crime, and deprived of his civil rights for 10 years. Zhang's defense lawyer declared in court that he was dissatisfied and would file a third appeal, which the court granted.</p>
<h3>New Director of the Shanghai Qingxiang Branch Issues Letter to the Public</h3>

<h3>The Purpose of the New Child Protection Section in the French Concession</h3>
<p>Since the French Municipal Council Health Department established the Child Protection Section on the 9th of this month, it has begun to handle matters related to the welfare of children in the French Concession. The nature of the section is exactly the same as the Child Protection Section of the Public Concession Municipal Council. Its most important work is to take in homeless children and wait for their parents to claim them. The French Concession Child Protection Section has also recently drafted measures to hold official publicity campaigns, similar to the "Children's Welfare Week" held by the Public Concession not long ago. The purpose of the publicity is to make residents of the French Concession understand the significance of the establishment of the section, and to inform parents of the educational knowledge they should have for their children.</p>
<h3>The Trend of Grave Robbing Has Resurfaced in the Suburbs of Shanghai; Local Authorities Strictly Pursue Perpetrators</h3>
<p>After the war, incidents of tomb robbery and corpse desecration occurred repeatedly. Since the municipal authorities effectively investigated and prohibited them, this trend has been suppressed. Unexpectedly, the trend of grave robbing has resurfaced recently in Jiading and other districts in the suburbs of Shanghai. Many graves have been dug up in various villages, with corpses scattered everywhere, exposing the wilderness. The tragic situation is unbearable to witness. The Shanghai Garrison Headquarters reported that, in order to effectively prevent the continued occurrence of this type of incident, in addition to offering a reward of 3,000 yuan for the arrest of grave robbers, it has also ordered its subordinates to assist in the arrest in order to maintain the law.</p>
<h3>The Practice of Purchasing New Goods with Old Goods Will Gradually Be Implemented</h3>
<p>In order to conserve resources in Shanghai, there is a growing trend towards gradually implementing the practice of purchasing new goods with old goods for various daily necessities. Currently, this practice has already begun for rubber overshoes and light bulbs. According to information obtained by a Datong News Agency reporter, in the near future, canned food, tin cans, or carton cigarettes, as well as various leather shoes, cloth shoes, and bottled ink, etc., may also implement this practice.</p>
<h3>Business Profit Tax: The Amount of Tax Payable Is Still Awaiting Verification; Old-Style Account Books Must Be Reviewed and Inspected</h3>
<p>The Shanghai District Collection Bureau of the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance has stipulated that the business profit tax for the 31st year of the Republic should be collected from all industries, businesses, banks, and money shops in this city starting this month, and has issued a general order to all industries to comply and complete the procedures for paying overdue taxes. The remittance shops affiliated with the Money Industry Association have already filled out the forms in detail, reporting their profits for last year. The association has collected them and submitted them to the bureau for review. Once the amount of tax payable has been reviewed and determined, each shop will pay the tax to the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank. The banking industry association is also actively working on it and will submit it to the bureau as soon as possible for review and tax payment. As for industrial, commercial, and company firms, those who keep new-style books have been rushing to file their returns, or have already completed and submitted them to the bureau. However, for those with old-style account books, the settlement and reporting procedures do not seem to be completed quickly. Even for those who have rushed to complete the work, the bureau will inevitably review the account books to verify the exact amount, and the work procedures will take some time before the tax payable can be determined. It is estimated that the business profit tax matters for various industries can be completed before June of this year.</p>
<h3>The Inaugural Meeting of the Local Security Association Held; The Meeting Place Is Temporarily Set in Nanshi; Mayor Chen Addressed the Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen the existing security associations in various districts and ensure local security, the municipal government of this city has organized a security association committee, which has been prepared and was officially established yesterday morning at 10:00 AM on the second floor of the municipal government. Secretary-General Zhao of the municipal government, as well as Director Lu Ying of the committee, and more than ten committee members including Pan Da, Tan Shuqian, Zhang Yicheng, Bu Lifu, Jin Shaofu, Lu Tieying, Ding Chao, and Xu Shaoxiu attended the meeting.</p>
<p>Hoping for Accurate Household Registration</p>
<p>After Chairman Lu Ying performed the necessary rituals, Mayor Chen delivered an address, mainly: (1) The security association is the foundation of self-government, and it is necessary to make the people understand the importance of the security association and complete the mission of the security association organization. However, the general public often disregards various important policies such as self-defense, education, and transportation, and refuses to fulfill their duties. This kind of mistaken concept should be corrected. (2) In terms of security association administration, it is hoped that the household registration will be accurate, so that the household registration of the security association is mutually consistent with the household registration of the police station and the district government. Subsequently, Director Lu made inquiries, stating that he would follow the guidelines instructed by the mayor, and hoped that the committee members would provide more suggestions at any time. The meeting concluded at 11:30 AM. It is understood that the association has appointed Zhang Yicheng as the director of the first section, Zhan Ximan as the director of the second section, and Zhu Yunsheng as the director of the third section. It has been decided that the association's office will be temporarily located in Nanshi.</p>

<h3>The Overflow of Human Desires</h3>
<p>-- Huang Tong</p>
<p>A friend humorously said to me: "Mahjong and concubines are the characteristics of most lanes in Shanghai." This friend had no statistical basis, just said it casually. However, if we have the leisure to visit most lanes, we will surely hear the sounds of mahjong clattering. If you live in a lane for a long time, after careful inquiry, you will be surprised by the number of concubines in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Playing mahjong and taking concubines are serious pathologies in our country. This is undeniable and does not need to be denied. Some men are focused on making "easy money." After making money, they spend their days playing mahjong and enjoying themselves, and taking concubines for pleasure. Some women only have the skill of playing mahjong, are greedy and lazy, and willingly become concubines. Human desires overflow. How can the family be healthy? How can the country and society become wealthy and strong?</p>
<p>Rectifying the mind, being sincere in intention, cultivating oneself, managing the family, governing the country, and bringing peace to the world - this set of skills is not the pedantry of Confucianism. If the country and nation are not to be corrupted and eliminated, this set of skills is absolutely indispensable.</p>
<p>Banning gambling by law and not giving concubines legal protection does have considerable effect. The fundamental solution still lies in: popularizing education, developing industry and commerce, and promoting wholesome entertainment. If government officials and people with status in society, as well as university professors, middle and primary school teachers, all lead by example, they will surely be able to change customs and eliminate long-standing malpractices.</p>
<h3>On the Broad Sense of Reading</h3>
<p>— Jiang Lang</p>
<p>Speaking of reading, many people think of it as an ivory tower, inaccessible; many people think of it as a confusing crossroads, unable to find the direction forward. But it can be said that these are all reactions to randomly picking up one or two books that are not suitable for oneself, resulting in giving up halfway, feeling stiff and boring. As a result, not only does it not increase one's interest in books, but it adds to the feeling of being overwhelmed by them. In fact, reading is not about gnawing on a bound or hardcover book, reading from the first sentence to the last. This is a narrow way of reading, only suitable for beginners.</p>
<p>However, reading is not for the sake of reading paper-bound books, but for the sake of life, to explore from them the paths of our lives and solve the problems of our lives. But everyone's path is different, and the author cannot write a book that is suitable for everyone. The difficulties that each person encounters on the road of life are by no means identical, so the author can only crudely provide some references. For this reason, reading should not blindly follow the book, but should be developed in the nature surrounding you. This is what is called reading in the broad sense.</p>
<p>Nature is a wordless encyclopedia. Are not the organizational situations of various nations and countries in the world ready-made reference books on economics, politics, and society? Are not mountains, rivers, forests, flowers, birds, fish, insects, and animals all-encompassing biology books? Is not the principle of apples falling and iron rusting a textbook of physics and chemistry? Therefore, we can obtain things described in books anytime and anywhere, and we can also get a lot of supplementary materials that we get from ourselves, enough for a lifetime of use.</p>
<p>From the above points, reading is undoubtedly to enrich knowledge. Knowledge itself is like the light of the sun, which everyone in the world can enjoy, except for some self-abandoned people who would rather not see the light of day. Then they will only end up as anemic weaklings for the rest of their lives, and as a result, they will not be able to solve the difficulties of life, nor will they be able to become complete people in society.</p>
<p>Since the opportunity to seek knowledge is everywhere, we should think of some ways not to let them escape, we must grasp them as much as possible and use them as much as possible, and then we must rely on the following rules to do it:</p>
<p>(A) Precise observation—If we want to learn a kind of knowledge and skills well, we must observe it in detail and find out where its truth lies. "Absent-minded, seeing without seeing, hearing without hearing, eating without knowing the taste." It can be seen that no matter what it is, it is difficult to be effective if it is not observed carefully and calmly. Therefore, when you are wandering in the park, you should use your eyes to observe the life forms of plants and animals. When visiting a factory, you can observe the power of the machines and doubt how the force originating in only one place can make all the machines generate power and work. So Watt also said a sentence: "My success is nothing more than observing all the new discoveries."</p>
<p>(B) Recording—Some people say: "Thoughts are like a bird. If you don't catch it immediately, it will fly away in an instant." To preserve the knowledge we get from observation by relying on memory is the most wasteful thing of brain power and time. Therefore, we must catch our own insights and record them at any time and anywhere. This has two advantages: one is to expand the realm of one's own knowledge, so that it gradually has new discoveries due to the expansion of the realm; the other is to obtain corroboration, so that one's own opinions can be cited with the things seen, and to study whether the two aspects are accurate and appropriate. It is said that the American novelist Hawthorne always carried a small notebook with him, whether he was walking on the street, sitting in the car, or traveling to various places, and he immediately wrote down whatever thoughts emerged. (We can imitate this.)</p>
<p>(C) Conversation—The pursuit of knowledge now is collective, not the era when one person lived quietly in an ancient temple or sat alone in a study and read the Four Books and Five Classics. Instead, it is the era of gathering a few like-minded friends to talk about each other's insights, which is the most beneficial to knowledge. Preserve what is worth preserving and record it for future reference. Discard what is not worth preserving, so that one's own knowledge will naturally become correct.</p>
<p>This is my so-called broad sense of reading, and there are certainly many omissions. But if you can lay a good foundation in books, and then give up using books (not absolutely) and engage in the observation of nature, the recording of observation insights, and the conversation of corroborating insights and ideas, this can also increase a person's knowledge.</p>
<h3>Wooden Motor Sailing Ship</h3>
<p>— Long Fisherman</p>
<p>The newspaper reported: Hong Kong's construction overview, which mentioned: "...Regarding the construction and repair of ships, the progress is very smooth, and the construction of wooden motor sailing ships has achieved particularly good results. In order to enhance Hong Kong's transportation capacity, this type of wooden motor sailing ship has now been used for the transportation of materials between Hong Kong and the south, and wooden motor sailing ships have been used as a major supplement to local transportation..."</p>
<p>At a time when prices are soaring and ships are scarce, the construction of wooden motor sailing ships is indeed a major event that cannot be delayed! We should use this type of ship as the only means of transportation at present! Such as evacuating the surplus population to their hometowns, transporting food to Vietnam, Thailand, etc... can all be used.</p>
<p>It is said that the Daozhong wooden motor ship is equipped with wooden machines, which are rotated by manpower and do not require fuel, which is very convenient. If Shanghai has this kind of wooden motor sailing ship, then Tianjin, Qingdao, Xiamen, Shantou, Hong Kong, and the Yangtze River Basin can all use it as the only tool for transporting materials.</p>
<h3>Genius Mystery</h3>
<p>— Sha Lei</p>
<p>Being able to write poetry at the age of three and compose prose at the age of seven is respected as a genius. Edison's achievements in electricity are also called the invention of a genius. Genius, genius, how many people admire it like a mystery.</p>
<p>However, there are also people who fundamentally deny the existence of genius in the world, saying that this is nothing more than the words of those who do not work hard to shirk the responsibilities they should bear.</p>
<p>Suppose we admit that there is indeed genius in the world. Comparing two children with the same musical genius, one is placed in a remote mountain temple, not allowed to contact the outside world, not allowed to tune the pipes and play the strings; what about the other? Let him immerse himself in the atmosphere of music every day, supervise him, educate him, and as a result, it is not difficult for us to think of the differences between them. The former becomes a fool, while the latter has achievements in music. Then, should we say that the former has no genius, and only admit that the latter has genius?</p>
<p>In this way, innate genius is not enough to rely on at all - it is like a tender sapling, without the nourishment of sunlight and rain, without fertilization and cultivation, even if it is lucky enough not to lose its vitality, it will definitely grow weak and inconspicuous. Therefore, a towering ancient tree has the conditions for its height and size. A child with genius, the acquired environment and upbringing, rewards and inducements, and his own efforts, can promote and encourage</p>
<p>Edison said: "One point of genius, nine points of effort." I think this is the appropriate interpretation of genius.</p>
<h3>Root</h3>
<p>— Xin Bo</p>
<p>After writing for a while, he suddenly stopped writing, turned his head, and asked the person on the earthen bed, "What is the price?"</p>
<p>"Didn't you say fifty-four yuan?" Yang Zijie replied.</p>
<p>"No, no," Genming hurriedly continued, "Fifty-four yuan is really not enough. Please, Mr. Huang, add some more." He said it very clearly and calmly.</p>
<p>"Old Gen, don't be insatiable," Huang Chong'an said with a straight face, "If it weren't for staying at your house for a few days three months ago, I wouldn't even want your field! Go and find out, in today's world, who is willing to put out cash to buy fields!"</p>
<p>"Yes! That's also because I said it again and again that Mr. Huang added four yuan to you. Now,..." Yang Zijie's words.</p>
<p>While they were talking about the amount of the price, Yu Duzhou's pen kept stopping, not writing down.</p>
<p>Genming still did not express his agreement, only saying "not enough, not enough" in a low voice.</p>
<p>"If you really want to use a few more yuan," Yang Zijie got off the earthen bed and walked to the account table, "then it is better to change the living contract to a dead contract." His hoarse voice was even more hoarse because he was a little anxious.</p>
<p>"I can't do this," Genming also stood up, seemingly afraid that Yu Duzhou would really write a dead contract, and wanted to stop it in advance, "I still have five sons!"</p>
<p>They had another argument. Genming had no timidity at all at this critical moment. He said that Huang Chong'an bought hundreds of acres of land every year, and it didn't matter to give a few more yuan for the price of one acre, and he also said that if Huang Chong'an helped him in his urgent need, he would always be grateful and would definitely try to repay him in the future, not to mention the kindness of staying at his house three or four months ago.

<h3>Second Report on Small Loan Program</h3>
<p>Our small loan program has always relied on donations from all walks of life. However, it has been found that donations have been scarce in the past two months, while the number of applicants has been increasing, resulting in weak deposits. Therefore, we have had to temporarily limit each person to a loan of fifty yuan. At a time when prices are high and rising, how can one make a living with a mere fifty yuan? For this reason, our office is appealing to enthusiastic people from all walks of life again, hoping for a steady stream of assistance so that the loan amount can be slightly increased, so that poor compatriots can maintain their livelihoods and alleviate the pain of living under pressure. As of March 15th, a total of 9,150.00 yuan has been received in donations, 1,260.00 yuan has been loaned out, and 7,890.00 yuan remains.</p>
<p>Preferential Treatment for Teachers in Group Weddings. The Da Lai Group Wedding has been held for 15 sessions, with a fee of only 120 yuan.
