<p>社評</p>
<h3>商充會各級機構厲行自肅</h3>
<p>全國商業統制總會，是爲謀物資之合理供應與分配，以安定民生而成立。從消費者方面言，無一人不熱烈期待着商統會工作的成功。照吾人理想，就是商人方面，假使是眼光遠大的話，也應該同樣的希望商統會工作的成功。因爲我國傳統觀念，一向是鄙視商人的。此次政府毅然將統制物資的職權交與商人自治團體去辦理，可說是中國有史以來的創舉。由於商統會之成功與吾，可以測騐吾國商人究竟有無自治能力，國家和人民是否可以將此一肩重擔，就此交與商人去辦理，這不但關係商人在目前的命運，還關係商人在未來社會之地位。其次，商人不能脫離整個社會而獨存，要是消費者被榨取到都無購買能力的地步，商人縱有大批存貨，也將向何處去銷售。要是社會秩序因多數人民之受不住生活高壓而不能寗靖，則少數擁有盜財者又豈能安享。老子云：「多藏必厚亡。」古有云：「千夫所指，無疾而死。」今日商人之智識程度，已遠非數　十年數百年前可比，對於切身利害，當早己了然胸中，故吾人認爲商人對商統會工作成功之期待，決不在一般消費者之下。</p>
<p>但數月以來，事實恰與理想相反。商統會雖爲商人集體自治機構，而商人之行動，則適與商統會工作原則相背馳，以物價而言，舉其大者，如棉紗棉布兩項，目前棉紗價格，已超越商統會成立時百分之一百以以，棉布亦超越百分之九十以上，此項紗布皆屬製成已久之品，絕無成本關係，紗布准許移動，爲日無幾，輸市不多，更非供求問題。那末，所以造成如此之暴漲者，爲少數不顧大局的商人投機操縱已彰彰明甚。外間傳說紗布上漲之原因，由於紗布聯營社成立，以黑市大量收購紗布，而紗布聯營社之股東，又均爲商統會下層機構之各同業公會會員，於是無論業內業外，紛紛揣測，以爲抬價之舉，乃商統會所默認，因之競爭搜購，逐漸　成紗布今日之高價。假使所傳不虛，我們對於見利忘義之商人，實堪切齒；尢其對於商統會，更表示遺憾。商統會之各級下層機構，如聯合會，如同業公會，大部分組織成立，商統會對於所屬之下層機構，是有權監督指揮的，何以對於所屬下層機構之追求私利的行爲，竟予容忍。退一步說，就使聯營社無以黑市收購紗布的行爲，但紗布價格，如此暴漲，從責任方面言，紗布同業公會也不能不對商統會負責，而商統會就不能不對人民負責。</p>
<p>商統會當局對於其所統制物資之暴漲，是否已有適應之緊急措置，外間無從得知，但吾們不能無疑者，即商統會對於所屬會員，祗有監督指揮之權，而無實施制裁之權，在此少數商人唯利是圖，不顧一切之際，商統會果將以何術挽此在瀾於既倒，蓋如取締而適得相反之結果，則威信之損失愈大。日本人士以商統會之成敗，爲吾國統制自主與日本對華新政策之試金石，日本在滬輿論界曾於社評中反覆提示，實足以代表其國家人民對於吾國物資統制之密切注視。商統會於此應感覺其使命何等重大，政府與人民於此，應如何督策與支持，以期該會完成使命，實爲當前重要問題。</p>
<p>統制工作，是對於人民經濟活動的干涉限制或管理，除了人民已有高深的程度，和能夠深切認識時代。認淸環境，是不容易得到了解的。換言之，就是想每個人民根本拋棄自私自利的主張，以造福人羣與社會，是一件極不容易做到的事，尤其是在被英美私利主義薰染過的上海，更是不易做到。以極不易做到的事，在極不易做的地方，而肩負此項使命者，又恰爲無干涉權力之商人團體，其使命之完成，加倍困難，然而統制物資既爲時代所必要，統制自主，又爲我們以往朝夕所期望之理想，一旦實現，自唯有上下一致，以生死不渝的精神，竭力促成之。</p>
<p>從政府方面言，第一，決不可因爲已將統制之權畀之商統會，便可以從此不聞不問，如果達到干涉之自的，最要緊的還離不了强制的權力。政府並未曾以此稱權力畀之商統會，則遇有必須行使此種權力的塲合，政府當然必須以全力做商統會的接盾。第二，政府查辦投機囤積之命令墨瀋未乾，而物價暴漲第二度之在潮又起，爲政府威信計，似　不能不加以嚴切注意。第三，中國的經濟問題，關係到大東亞經濟問題，日本人士已經說過物資統制自主，是日本對華新政策的試金石，政府對此似不能不特加重視。一個國家在戰爭時期，政府對於安定人民生活，維持社會秩序，本可行使特別權力，何况關於處置囤積，安定物價的種種法令，政府早已先後頒佈，祇須令出法隨，或者進一步照工部局物資統制處長稻垣氏的建議，將一兩個罪大惡極者，從嚴處辦，施以極刑，我們相信若輩固然重視金錢，但是同時也未嘗不重視生命，決不敢再像以往的猖獗。一般物價縱使不能像我們想像的跌落，至少不至像最近半月來的暴漲。</p>
<p>從人民方面言，實施物資統制，原應該由政府來主持，因爲統制這一件事，必須生產者與消費者兼顧，唯有政府纔可以處於兩者兼顧之地位，商統會祇能代表生產者，販賣者，無論其態度如何公正，已有不能兼顧消費者意見之危險，何况自商統會成立以來，所給予我們的印象，都有一種不能顧到消費者利益的傾向，生活對於一般人的壓迫，已　重到如此地步，我們對於本身生存的問題，自然不能保持緘默。我們所倚賴的是政府，我們請求政府，督策商統會實行同業自肅的方法，按照同業公會組織條例，凡經營某業之商號必須加入該同業公會爲會員，依照爲施行物資統制而規定之現行組織，同業公會必爲聯合會之會員；而聯合會又必爲商統會之會員。假使商統會的下層機構，　能層層負責，厲行自肅，則業外之少數囤槓者，當亦無所施其伎倆，即放任之，亦決不至影響市面。</p>
<p>大陸新報社評曾曰：「不幸最近商統會的內部，不能理解其本身的重要任務，發生了促使商統會成爲肆無忌憚追求私利的機關之危險傾向。」其所據之理由，爲傳聞商統會不允棉紗棉布運往內地，事實上承認黑市，希圖不法利潤。從此可以看出日本在滬人士對於商統會的工作，是何等的重視，物價暴漲，對於商統會所留下的印象，是何等的惡劣。所以我們深切希望商統會能從速糾正既往，注意未來，以免引起更嚴重之後果，那纔算不辜辜負政府與人民的熱烈期望。</p>

<h3>汪主席接見日記者　暢論大東亞共榮圈　各獨立國家應團結一致互相依賴　東亞聯盟綱要爲建立共榮圈基礎</h3>
<p>南京廿七日中央社電　中國朝野前决獲悉日東條首相在議會發表之演說，莫不深爲歡迎。日本同盟通訊社記者於廿六日下午晋謁國府汪主席致敬時，並叩詢主席對大東亞建設之意見，當承主席親予賜見，並蒙發表談話。汪主席對日本東條首相演說中所指出之日本建設大東亞共榮圈，極爲贊揚。並力言東亞聯盟綱要四條，及新國民運動之重要性。茲謹誌主席談話大意如次：</p>
<p>（一）中日關係之現在與將來：中日倏約將從根本上予以改訂者，完全爲日本之好感，故中國俟日本具體開示後，始陳述其自己之意見者，乃屬常禮。惟在此事未實現以前，自應根據旣存條約，盡遵守之義務。據余（主席自稱）個人見解，認爲中日間各種倏的，因締結當時之情形，大致可分爲二種：一爲規定中日永久之友好提携之關係者，此雖在今日以及今後亦不需絲毫改訂，二則爲當時考慮中日兩國間有英美等敵性國存在而締結者，此自應適應現在及將來之客觀的時代變化，而作適當之改訂。則中日兩國關係必能因此而恢復其本然之姿態，而能同生共死。日東條首相過去曾屢次言及此事，余及國府高級人員亦會研究，等待時機到來，於日本表明此種好意時，能立即呼應。爲適應此種事態，自應竭力以赴也。關於大東亞建設之雄渾構想，及緬甸菲島獨立之約定，緬甸及菲島開聽之餘，其歡樂情形，吾人不雖想像。即其他各民族對將來亦必充滿無限之希望。而余所最爲關懷者，厥爲所謂大東亞獨立之特異性格。夫大東亞各獨立國係根據共存共榮之理念而團結者，故彼此不應發生對立與傾軋，應根據互相依賴之關係而團結一致。然此事雖僅在理想上能予理解，但若不視爲一實際問題，而確立彼此適當之關係，則共榮圈難於實現，此即爲余以前所以成立東亞聯盟而親自指導之理由。</p>
<p>（二）東亞聯盟揚示四項要綱以爲主張，余認爲此項要網適用於大東亞圈內各獨立國家間之基本關係上者，甚爲有望。現將此四項要綱略作說明如次：（甲）政治獨立，此點自不待言，爲民族自治權之確認，關於內政自應根據各民族各國家之責任及創意，自行治　此事。日本早已主張，現且巳鄭重付諸實行。（乙）軍事同盟，此在具體上乃共同防衛而言，使各自武裝經常担任共同之任務，防衛其間有處於指導地位之國家，與處於協助地位之國家者，乃爲當然，但此並非對立。共同防衛在使各國之槍口常置於同一方向，則各國之對立自能解消。（丙）經濟提携，各國家間若在經濟上感覺隔膜，則各國家間之關係難見完滿，故應使獨立國家間之經濟提携合理而緊密，以除去經濟上之對立。（丁）文化溝通，其重要性並不少於上述三事，余深信中國文化，實足與日本文化爲積極的協力，以蘄致全東文化之向上，英美等之東亞政策，係殖民政策，故其對於原住民採取愚民政策，但愚民之結集體，實難以繁榮，而成爲强有力之共榮圈。且苦無文化之交流，則共榮圈內各國家頗難互相理解，並難團結一致。余曾於三十二年前旅行於南洋各地，當時目睹原住民受統治者之壓迫，苦不堪言，自是以來，余確信溝通文化，實爲團結束亞各民族及解　東亞之要素。此四項綱領，若能實現，則東亞之不平不滿必能解除，同時對立抗爭之原因，亦必能由此而除去，則東亞各國必將打成一片，與指導國家日本共存共榮。故余願提出此東亞聯盟四項要綱，充分與日本之興亞運動協力，互相提携以奠立大東亞共榮圈，但此事尚未正式與日本興亞同盟總本部一談，惟望日本充分予以考慮。</p>
<p>（三）新國民運動亦爲大東亞建設之基木條件，其重要性並不少於上述四項應以指導國民，尤其靑少年階級爲對象，展開物質心理兩方面之新國民運動。蓋此次戰事並非爲所謂利害衝突之局部戰事，乃爲人類世界之一大革命，又爲人類生活之變革，因鑒於此故，故應造就將來眞正能肩負新大東亞之大東亞人。現中日滿泰等國均已竭力推進國民運動，惟以目下情形而觀，均係個別推進，將來實有彼此提携推進之必要。大東亞各國各民族均應一致參加此種運動，藉推進此種運動以確立彼此之友好關係。余常力言各愛其國，互愛其鄰，共愛東亞三個標語，以爲現在國民政府推進新國民運動之指　精神，蓋愛國若專在利己，則並非爲眞正之愛國，惟有愛鄰愛東亞，始爲眞正之愛國。此種精神與日本家族主義的道義關係之確立，以及八纮一字之精神，完全相印合。</p>
<h3>出席全經會議華北代表　王蔭泰等婧感想</h3>
<p>中央社京　訊全國經濟委員會第二次全體委員會議業已圓滿閉幕。會議雖僅一日，收獲殊匪淺鮮。對今後戰時經濟施策及整個經濟復興建設方案，均己有具體決議。中央社記者昨特分訪王蔭泰，殷汝耕，鄒泉蓀，及何庭流等，叩詢出席此次會議之感想，及個人對經濟建設之抱負，茲分誌如下：</p>
<p>王蔭泰</p>
<p>本屆會議討論果，至爲圓滿。所有全部決議案並頗切符實際，深信今後經濟建設工作，定能因此次之決議而得以順利完成。尤以本人所提關於華北方面各問題，均獲圓滿通過，更爲欣慰。日內並將轉道赴滬一行，與全國商統會當局洽商關於物資交流問題，以期兩地物資得以圓滑暢通。最後談及華北災情，據謂現華北政委會當局已有具體辦法決定，計分治本與治標兩辦法進行。本季麥作收成預料較上年爲豐，當亦可稍解食糧之恐慌。至對中央方面關懷華北災情之殷切，深爲感謝。</p>
<p>殷汝耕</p>
<p>華北爲急謀燃料之增產，特開發山西一帶煤藏。現在中日合辦之山西煤礦公司組織下合併過去保晋·建昌·壽湯等公司股本，中日合資各佔二分之一，內部負責人員亦爲中日之富有經騐者。現有礦工約二萬人，每年產量已達一百五十萬噸。預計四年後每年可增至四百萬噸。至南運問題首宜解決運輸工具，若用火車則太不經濟，故將來擬利用保定至石家莊之運河運輸，再由大運河運至華中一帶。至保定石家莊間之運河，刻正在疏濬中，已完成二分之一以上，一年以後當可工竣。</p>
<p>何廷流</p>
<p>本人原屬在京供職，而現寓居北京。此次來京參與大會，深感異常圓滿。預計今後華中華北對於物資交流圓滑，當不難逐步實現。華北災情現因政委會當局正籌救濟政策，加以中央方面復謀急振，不久當可解決。且今年麥季莊稼甚爲豐稔，預料收穫以後，不難全部解決。至於以後食糧，當局已有整個計劃，將來除加强統制外，擬再向華北中滿蒙方面儘力購買，以彌袖不足。</p>
<p>鄒泉蓀</p>
<p>此次會議收穫殊大，各項議案均經縝密討論，今後實施時，祗須製成具體推行計劃，定能澈底實行。本人現爲華北商業聯合會會長，在商業立塲言，則本年度華北商業情况，已較往年爲遜。對解決目前災荒問題，除積極增加生產之治本辦法外，更宜加强統制配給制度，以求平衡合理，故不久華北統制配給機構，即將重加調整强化。本人日內並擬隨王殷兩常委赴滬一行，參觀全國商業統制總會之組織，以資借鏡。</p>
<h3>華北政治經濟　進展情況</h3>
<p>北京廿七日中央社電　華北自中日關係進入新階段後之進展情况，略誌如次：（一）物價糧食燃料問題，國府華北政務委員會前於物價物資統制委員會之下，設立糧食監理局，並於各省及各特別市設立糧食採運社，更於本月五日，頒發關於限制糧價之條例，於二十日起實施公定價格制，因此糧價自本月六日以來，即日益跌下，目前已下降至與本年三月間之價格相同。（二）防共問題自過去之滅共委員會作發展的解消後，即另於國府華北政務委員會之下，重新設立剿共委員會，由政委會及新民會協力，以擔任今後剿共之重大使命。並於各縣設立剿共委員會支部，對中共之政治攻勢，開始作猛烈之鬥爭。同時山西省內之民衆自衛紙織，已編成靑年隊，完成防共壁壘。（三）勞工問題於開發晋北晋西一帶之煤鐵石灰等重要資源所需之勞力，因中國北部地域素以擁有廣大之人力資源著稱於世，故毫無若何困難，即如大同煤礦於中日工人共同努力之下，展開增產運動後，刻已突破預定產額，而使運輸方面有應接不暇之勢。（四）治安情形，自渝第二十四集團軍軍長龐炳動及孫殿英兩將軍參加和運後，昔以太行山脈爲根據地之渝軍即吿完全崩潰，同時冀東晋北晋南各地之共軍，亦被覆滅，故治安情形已日趨鞏固。</p>
<h3>田中領事等將來滬　主持興亞翼贊會議</h3>
<p>南京二十七日中央社電　日本於華中華南之興亞翼贊會定於下月一日在上海舉行開會式，並將於大使館所在地設立多數支部，南京方面並將籌組是項興亞翼贊會，惟須俟匕海方面指令到達後始可決定。又上海七月一日舉行之開會式南京將由田中總領事，神谷副領事等前往主持。</p>
<h3>新運會暑期集訓　今日入營</h3>
<p>南京二十七日中央社電　新國民運動促進委員會暑期集訓第一屆學員及靑少年團兩營各項準備均已就緒，定於二十八日上午八時十二時下午一時至六時爲入營時間，入營手續分註冊及體格檢騐兩項，所有人員如均能於本日入營，人數即爲六百十四人。</p>
<p>南京二十七中央社電　新國民靑少年運動之領導老林柏生氏曁以下新運幹部，二十六日於宣傳部會議窒協議暑期集訓之一切準備事宜，林氏等爲表率靑年實踐新運，均剃成光髮，作爲暑期集訓躬親指導之首步表現。此種勵行精神，意義殊爲深遠。</p>
<h3>褚民誼招待外賓　遊覽鎭江名勝</h3>
<p>南京二十七日中央社電　外交部部長褚民誼於二十七日招待在京外交團人員赴鎭遊覽金焦二山及甘露寺等名勝，被邀參加者有日大使谷正之，滿大使呂榮寰，義大使戴良誼，及各大使館高級館員等共約三十餘人，由京於上午乘急行車赴鎭。</p>

<h3>維里基魯基附近　蘇軍進攻受創而退　戰況久寂後大戰有早日爆發可能</h3>
<p>斯德哥爾摩二十七日中央社電　據海通社消息星期五日維里基魯基附近，戰事較前數日更爲活躍，蘇軍會在該區屢决進攻，均受重創而退。據英國駐蘇軍總部訪員電稱，英斯科方面，似預料東綫沉靜之後，大戰有早日爆發可能，此項電訊中，暗示蘇軍現正積極鞏固其防禦陣地，及各根據地，紅軍喉舌斯維斯達報，曾著有長篇社論，警吿蘇聯人民，愼勿低估德軍戰鬥力量，東綫局勢，隨時可發生急遽之變化云。</p>
<p>柏林二十七日中央社電　東部戰綫，除維里基魯基方面外，殆無大規模戰鬥。德軍於開始夏季攻勢前，仍保持沉默，據德軍常局於二十六日說明東綫自十九日至二十五日間之戰局，謂德蘇戰事。迄本月二十二日，已進入第三年。關於德蘇戰局之展望，尙不容預測。但過去二年間，德軍已極度挫折蘇軍之戰鬥力，實毫無可疑。蘇聯之主要農業工業地帶，亦已被德軍佔領。東部戰綫，自十九日至二十五日間，並無特別可述之戰鬥。預料一俟夏季來臨。全綫即將展開空前劇戰。蘇軍於過去二年間，已蒙鉅創，因而喪失作戰之主動地位。蘇軍亦承認德軍確占質的優勢，即在數量上，德軍現亦有可與蘇軍匹敵之勢。德軍對塞爾維亞遊擊軍之掃蕩戰，刻正順利進展中。上週內該遊擊隊員，已戰死萬人，反軸心空軍最近雖加强濫炸德國各都市，但敵空軍轟炸機之喪失極鉅。如上週一日間，分被德空軍一舉擊落七十架。又某日則喪失飛機九十架，故反軸心空軍，縱實力極强，尙須認識此項事態，其間德空軍之損害極爲輕微。由此足證德空軍人員素質技術之高越云。</p>
<h3>對於第二戰綫開闢　反軸心仍夜長夢多　英美民衆對此事前途疑懼與日俱增　侵犯歐陸能否成軾亦毫無把握可言</h3>
<p>阿姆斯達丹中央社二十六日電　據華盛頓消息，羅斯福德統於星期五日宜稱，渠對於開闢第二戰綫之願望，迫切之情，不下於蘇聯云。</p>
<p>斯德哥爾摩廿七日中央社電　據海通社引路透社駐莫斯科特派記者金氏稱，莫斯科報紙，現正特別登載英美準備加速開設第二戰綫之消息，該記者認爲蘇報之特別記載此項消息，即可表明蘇聯民衆之渴望設立第二戰綫，俾德軍發動攻勢時，蘇軍不必單獨遭受德軍之打擊云。</p>
<p>里斯本廿七日中央社電　海通社訊，反軸心國侵犯歐洲一事，雖仍爲英美兩系之主要討論資料，但雙方對於此事前途之觀察，疑懼之心理與日俱增。英美民衆，現開始引爲疑問者，不僅爲實施侵犯之時間與地點，且及於此項侵犯之是否屬可能，及有無成功之機會。據里斯本所接外交及私人方面之消息，均以反軸心國之力量，是否足以在歐登陸及在莫斯科所擬未來勢力範圍之外展開眞正之攻勢爲問，另一問題，爲一般人之常加提及者，爲反軸心軍即使登陸成功，其軍隊亦必將喪失過半。果爾，則此項慘重損失，是否不致削弱英美之戰鬥能力，及國內之民氣，此項估計，係出諸英軍事專家，自非毫無根據者可比。最後問題，爲英美在歐洲某地登陸後，是否眞能救蘇聯之急，關於此點，尙包括是否眞有充分船舶與空軍，可於同時在數地作登陸企圖之疑問。英美顯亦慮及當反軸心軍冒險登陸時，蘇聯是否將履行其在東綫發動攻勢之諾言，此外又因反軸心方面所獲消息，皆盛稱過去十八個月中，德方在歐洲沿海岸所建之堅强防禦工事，故紛紛懷疑此項侵犯，是否能在本年中實現。目前反軸心國有一事可斷定者，即歐洲海岸砲位之力量，業已數度領略矣。英美軍事評論家亦警吿國人，勿以爲德國遭受空襲及東綫戰事，已使其軍事力量削弱，而可輕易完成登陸企圖。英蘇兩國，對南歐之將來命運，似彼此懷有意見，美國對此，現尙無左袒任何一方之表示。關于西班牙方面，英報紙及無綫電台，對於弗朗哥常有不滿之論調，英美對葡萄牙，聞已要求其闡明態度矣。同時又據北非及西非傳來消息，皆謂美國現正恒於在該處擴充勢力云。</p>
<p>義國防衛固若金湯</p>
<p>羅馬廿七日中央社電　羅馬民報廿六日載文，論地中海戰况與展開歐洲第二戰綫之可能性，表明義國之防衛，已固若金湯，大意謂，義國戰綫，爲目下歐洲之最主要戰塲，但英美軍如欲企圖侵略義國，則彼等必將遭遇開戰以來之最大困難，義軍對於防守歐洲之前哨防衛綫，即義本國領土及領海，巳有萬全之準備，英美軍之集中其最精銳兵力於對義作戰，蓋即爲此，即使反軸心軍萬一在義國本土設立橋頭堡，暫獲成功，但欲繼續補充兵力，或擴大區域，則相差遠甚。</p>
<p>傳德派軍防義北部</p>
<p>阿根廷京城二十七日中央社電　據華盛頓消息，傳德軍數師團，爲防備反軸心軍進行歐洲登陸作戰，已調往義國北部，担任警備通往累納山隘之進路云。</p>
<h3>巴西與玻里維亞　擬簽訂互助公約　又兩國商約不久即將簽字</h3>
<p>倍諾斯愛勒二十七日中央社電　據海通社訊，巴西陸軍部長杜特拉將軍，昨日在巴西步兵總部，宴請玻里維亞總統瑪納蘭達時宣稱，巴西意欲與玻里維亞締結互助公的，玻外長埃里奧當時亦在席，表示希望兩國更密切合作。同時據玻里維亞駐巴大使宜稱，玻巴商約，不久即將簽訂，該的將規定，兩國互相輸出食物等各以生產之便利，巴西銀行將在拉巴斯設立分行。</p>
<h3>智外長將出席議會　發表外交演說</h3>
<p>倍諾斯愛勒廿七日中央社電　海通社引聖地亞哥消息，智利外長費南狄斯將，於星期三議會之不公開會議中，講述智利之外交政策，並將特別討論玻里維亞之要求割讓亞里加海港。關於此點，此間政界方面指出，巴西之聖多斯海港，已作爲自由港，任由玻里維亞使用，該港距玻里維亞邊境一千公里，因此玻里維亞僅能偶然使用云。</p>
<h3>德國美術展覽會　在慕尼黑開幕　宣傳部長戈培爾出席演說</h3>
<p>慕尼黑廿七日中央社電　德國美術展覽會，於廿六日在此開舉行開幕典禮，德宣傳部長郭培爾，曾出席演說，力言德義兩國爲傳統文化之擁護者，並指責反軸心空軍之轟炸德國都市，實爲破壞歐洲文化，其大意謂英美兩國，自稱爲人類文化發揚者，並向世人高呼「吾人爲世界文化之擁護者」，但英美兩國對於文化之毫無貢獻，乃爲昭然之事實。惟德國及其盟國，始爲人類文化之眞正擁護者，良以興登堡慕尼黑佛羅倫斯及威尼斯等地，皆爲西洋文化之發祥地，美洲大陸，在文化方面，完全不値一談。美國民亦不能漠視音樂家斐多溫瓦格那及米開蘭捷羅堡達文提等所遺留之偉業，英美入屢言「吾入不與軸心國文化而戰，係與其機構而戰，」但英美空軍竟轟炸德國及義國之文化都市。炸毀責重之藝術品，是以吾人在此次戰爭中，不僅考慮物質方面，即知識之生活，亦應加以考慮，蓋藝術實爲知識活動之產物，但英美空軍盲目轟炸我藝術都市，實欲殲滅德國國民知識之能力，英美此非人道之暴行，惟有增加德國國民敵愾之心而已。</p>
<h3>德本年穀物收成　可希望豐收</h3>
<p>柏林二十七日中央社電　海通社訊，德國本年之穀類收成，將頗滿意，由於天氣之優良，收成將較去年早三四星期開始。有數處地方之大麥及裸麥，在最近之將來，即可收成。消息靈通方面指出，如全賴氣候，則收成必大佳，但本年夏季，已屬戰爭之第四年，故肥料及其他物品如機車等，自感缺少，農人等曾受鼓勵，於脂肪之生產，牛奶之供應，雖巳不斷增加，乳油之產量，亦由一九三九年之四二五，〇〇〇噸，增至一九四二年之七〇〇，〇〇〇噸，但相信仍可增加，現時並已頒行新法規，規定農人須以一定數目之肥豕，供應食物市塲，農業專家指出，專備桶植油質果木之地區，較戰前巳增加百分之一百，計現有一，二〇〇，〇〇〇英畝，且在本年內更將推廣。</p>
<h3>柏林政界重視　季勞赴美之舉</h3>
<p>柏林二十七日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，羅期福總統邀請季勞赴華盛頓一事，已引起柏林政界之相當注意，認爲此乃羅氏重對北非事務，感覺興趣之象徵，並信美國於最近英王視察北非之後，頗有增加其在該方面勢力之可能。</p>
<p>反軸心飛機　轟炸義城市</p>
<p>羅馬二十七日中央社電　昨日義大利總司令部宣稱，星期五日反軸心飛機，轟炸義國各城市之結，共死九十三人，傷九十九人，計米西納死八十一人，傷八十五人，巴里死傷各十人，維齋尼死二人傷四人。</p>
<h3>英航空大臣　飛換鞋上羅陀</h3>
<p>馬德里二十七日中央社電　據此間接獲拉里尼消息，英航空大臣辛克萊，昨日乘飛機抵達直布羅陀，此行目的，及將逗留多久，未曾透露。</p>
<p>馬德里二十七日中央社電　據此間所接消息，英海軍之若干巨艦，昨日駛抵直布羅陀。除驅逐艦二十一號，三十號，六十四號與T六十三號以及星期五日巳發表者外，目前停泊該港者，計有英航空母艦與巡洋艦各二艘，驅逐艦多艘，及法驅逐艦二艘，與波蘭驅逐艦一艘，直布羅陀之海軍砲位，昨日繼續舉行演習。</p>
<h3>土對反軸心國　態度已趨冷落</h3>
<p>巴斯勒二十七日中央社電　海通社訊，巴斯勒新聞報駐倫敦記者稱，土耳其對英美之態度，近來巳有轉變。土國雖一再申明願參加反軸心國之戰後和會於前，近以英美之居心巳漸明瞭，故態度巳趨冷落。同時對於軸心國之態度，則有接近之兆。此可由土軍事團赴德時之盛大歡送典禮，及土報章之言論見之。烏魯斯報社評作者埃斯末，近亦謂反軸心國際，對軸心國作神經戰外，顯然無眞正在歐登陸之適當準備，豈土國對反軸心國之勝利，巳覺懷疑乎。抑以英蘇要求開放韃靼尼爾海峽所允給之代價，似嫌未足乎，此則有待於今後事實之證明矣。</p>
<h3>鮑斯出現東京　英方頗感不安</h3>
<p>軍斯本二十六日中央社電　倫敦泰晤士報，近曾以「江特拉鮑斯在東京」爲題，記載鮑斯東渡事，字裏行間，頗有不安之色，大意謂全印國民會議派前議長江特拉鮑斯氏之出現東京，軸心國報紙對渠今後活動，均極期待。</p>
<h3>日潛水艦揚威南太平洋</h3>
<p>（〇〇基地　平手特派員發）自在所羅門殲　敵艦隊後，以澳洲附近爲舞台而展開的日本通商破壞戰，現又在所羅門，新幾內亞挑戰，威脅美澳兵站戰的陣勢。敵方運輸綫的恐怖情緒愈見高漲。英勇的日本鐵鯨，以雪尼爲中心，在敵方的交通網中神出鬼沒，屢次避過敵方飛機，驅逐艦的耳目，在若干天的短期間內，獲得了擊沉滿載軍需品的運輸船六般，五萬四千噸的大戰果。某月某日，又突入有驅逐艦二艘保護若的大運輸船團，同時，使二艘滿載軍需物資的貨物船二艘埋於海底，充分發揮我冠絕世界的潛水艦之威力，這裏所應該銘記的，即是深入敵陣，克服長時間潛航的惡劣空氣，不分畫夜，在敵方的制海制空圈下，待機襲擊敵船的潛水艦船員的勞苦。敵商船現在亦已具有大砲及炸彈的攻擊力，與昔日完全改觀，破壞通商和襲艦艇同樣不是輕易可致的。突破一切的辛酸與危險，忘却一切而一心邁進的船員之奮鬥精神。實爲日本海軍之花，擊滅英美的先驅。下而所叙，是某潛水艦的實戰記。</p>
<p>一路南下至澳洲沿岸，探照燈的光芒到處在海面活躍，這季節的澳洲，白晝的時間非常長，每天的日程，晝夜顚倒，黃昏四時半早餐，午夜十二時半午膳，朝晨四時半晚餐，白天因在長期間的潛航中，故空氣極爲惡濁。白天不値勤的船員，乘此機會作充分的睡眠，以備夜間的活躍。待艦身浮上水面，艦長因已習於夜視，親自在艦橋鼓勵瞭望員，繼續索敵，片刻不懈。某月某日夜，首先進入視野的是八千噸級的貨船，在月明之下，悠然前進。於是向敵船發射魚雷。命中敵船中央部，機艙爆炸，突然揚起。猛烈的水柱，立即消失於白色的烟幕中。敵船淸晰地發出求救的信號，捷足先逃的船員，袖珍電燈應約顯現，爭上小船，但小船的左舷亦意外地被魚雷命中，向右厲害的傾側，不久，右甲板浸水，而漸漸沒入水中。</p>
<p>翌日，再向敵地前進，遭遇八千噸級的油槽船，魚雷命中船尾，又激　猛烈的霧蒸氣，船尾開始下沉，數分鐘後敵人投下魚雷，一見我艦浮上水面，船首之火砲立即開火，作最後的掙扎。但敵船漸次船首向上，船尾下沉。側立沒入海中。</p>
<p>突入敵方警戒網</p>
<p>在這附近擊沉了一艘以後，敵的警戒常然愈趨嚴密。尤以此地離澳洲沿岸頗近，爲欲突被敵機的哨戒，向某某方面轉航，首先遇到敵驅逐艦，於是再向某某方向進航，重又發見　逐艦，但我艦不顧一切，闖入敵的水洩不通的警戒中。</p>
<p>這種眼與眼的鬥爭，其勝利是絕對屬於我方的。因爲我方平日訓練有素的關係，早已發見敵艦。巧妙地隱蔽我　的所在，但敵人則尙在盲目搜索。</p>
<p>翌日一早，就老遠聽見蓬蓬的魚雷爆炸聲，船員的臉上，顯出了會心的微笑，那夜又碰到敵驅逐艦，轉進時又遇到二艘。上而在月光如畫的天空中，敵機在巡迥哨戒。也我艦卒未被發見。</p>
<p>如其浮上水面，一定要遇到躯逐艦，海而雖廣，但我們却突入了幾無容身之地的狹隘水面，白從突入防禦至嚴的敵方哨戒綱之後的襲擊，明知這是決死的冒險，但全艦精神振奮，以待其次的機會，艦長屝息凝神，緊張萬分。艦身在白天即巳浮上很久，在怒濤衝浪中，雖明知不敵，但船員仍交替作日光浴，以養蓄新的攻擊力。　日黃昏。沛然大雨如注：覆於海面，驟然間有一萬噸級的貨船一艘出現於大雨中。若無其事地悠然航行着。待至日暮，加以襲擊。侖中機械室，機械立即停止，用商船電波發出SOS急救的信號以明其位置。因一時間尙不容易下沉，乃再接再厲繼續向其發射，終於船首上翹。船尾漸次向下，巨體沉沒於海底。</p>
<p>捕獲大運輸船團</p>
<p>此後，因無好機會，乃繼續在洋面游弋，某月某日夜，捉獲了從墨爾鉢恩方而組成的輸運船大隊向雪尼前進。有八千噸級的貨物船十艘，另有驅逐艦二艘護衛。並不知悉我方前去奇襲。在烟霧溟濛中迫近時，因視綫惡劣，襲擊甚爲困難。如等至天明，恐有變故，乃毅然突破這驅逐艦的警戒陣，此時如有神助，船團上空的雲陣突見晴朗，獵戶座三星美麗地在天空閃耀着。這許多船反映在我潛望鏡中成爲一團，於是開始攻擊，這眞可說是奇蹟，相繼發射的魚雷同時命中二艘敵船，一艘立即發生大火，映紅了半　天空及海面，火光中另一艘則正在向右傾斜而沉沒中。朦朧中因此巨變而驚愕的船　，瞬即隊形混亂，四散遁走，這種同時擊沉二艘的偉大的戰果，唯賴我潛水艦長的　越技倆，始能獲此勝利。</p>
<p>繼於某日晚上，一萬二千噸級貨物船又落入我方所張的網中來了，沒有月亮，伸手不辨五指的漆黑中，發見了這巨船，途繞出其前面，等待拂曉，向其機械室的後部瞄準其烟囪的下面發射魚雷，祇聽得轟然爆發的巨聲，那龐大的船　也向　裏沉下去了。發射後不久，敵卞飛行艇不久飛臨出事地點，降落水面、開始從事援救。</p>
<p>不久，我們從司令部接到祝電，慶祝擊沉敵船六艘五萬四千噸的大戰果。電文說：「祝某某潛水艦在短期間收獲了偉大的戰果。」艦上船員們的士氣，愈加昂奮起來了。（翔：譯自六月十五日西部每日新聞）</p>

<h3>積極疏通來源　維持本市油糖供應</h3>

<p>訂購臺糖運滬接濟</p>
<p>食糖按期由合作處呈請軍配當局核准，辦理計口授糖，及特種配給。關於食糖存底，雖較前减少，惟已由當局向台灣訂購，裝輪運滬接濟，所以此後決能持久維持。關於第四期戶口糖，已於前日起，由各零售商普遍發售，至七月五日爲止。惟市區原定二十一日起至三十日止，頃以出貨遲緩，不及如期開始，已由糧食局佈吿，展延至七月三日爲止，至於各業業務上需要之特種配給，巳於日前憑核准通知書，向合作處繳淸貨款，向指定乙種零售商領取，惟規定祗准自用，不准轉售，違者永久停止配給，此外對於經銷食油食糖之零售商，已予嚴格管理，以杜流弊云。</p>

<h3>市區嚴查公共塲所</h3>

<h3>申報杯籃球賽　中青十五對十二加勝西青　今晚最後決鬥　提早於七時半開賽　拍賣義球行給獎禮</h3>
<p>中靑與本報聯合主辦之申報盃華北賑災慈善籃球賽，於前晚揭開戰幕，中靑賴將士用命，以廿一比十八旗開得勝。昨晚八時賡續舉行第二幕，中靑再度與西靑會師。</p>
<p>昨日觀衆更形擁擠</p>
<p>觀衆擁擠內擠得水洩不通，約計在千人以上。開賽時，西靑陶勃林基與凱齊密洛夫遲到，上半時僅成偏師應戰，遂深陷於不景氣氛圍，惟經激烈搏戰，結果終能追至極接近局面。中靑於後半時，僅獲一分，亦足見戰局過程之緊張，及西靑實力之並非平凡，惜因前半損失過多，西靑終以三分之差，以十二比十五又遭失敗。</p>

<p>前半中青虎躍龍騰</p>
<p>裁判劉荷生嗚笛開賽，大戰爆發，西靑因主將之缺陣，遂不得不以偏師應戰。中靑方面，虎躍龍騰，林維聰旣開紀錄，張錦璇余邭子接連命中，稍隔些時，小林又吿成功，紀分板上，已高掛八分。西靑奮力苦戰，始由耶龍勉中一鹄，打破鴨蛋。然未幾錦璇再渡劉郎，重遊舊地，比數增至十比二後，陶勃林基郎凱齊密洛夫始姍姍來臨，即參戰陣，陶勃林基罰中一鵠後，終因陣脚未固，唐學聲余邭子又連中兩元，迨佛尼克建勛，前半已吿結束，中靑以十四比五佔得，無上優勢。</p>
<p>下半西青加急反攻</p>
<p>西戰聲起，西青以最標準陣容作戰，鬥力逾見活躍。勃脫既先探驪，凱齊亦中一罰，沙司金又吿成功，一剎那間，已連中五分，其時西靑攻勢鼎盛。中靑屢射失鹄，惟西靑因操之過急，以致亦每擲俱虛。戰局雖見緊張，收獲則兩無所獲。迨至最後兩分半鐘。余邭子因勃脫之犯規，罰中一鹄。中靑獲此寳貴之一分後，即改取緩攻戰略，以保勝局。西靑由沙司金探得一籃，終因時不我待，以十二比十五慘敗，中靑宣吿連勝。並悉中靑管理談星波君，爲祝捷起見，今晚將設宴犒師。</p>
<p>今是兩隊最後決戰</p>
<p>今晚爲最後一幕，提早於七時半開賽。西靑被挫折之餘，勢挽須力狂瀾，其緊張情形，當可預卜。今晚仍將拍賣義球，並舉行給獎典禮。</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>如何補救生產事業的缺陷</h3>
<p>最近社會上發現不良之現象，爲失業人數之日增，雖原因不止一端，而工廠生產率之減少，實爲巨因，以致停工減工者日多一日，不但新工人無由挿足，且併原有工人亦次第淘汰，此爲最堪隱憂之一事。推究工廠生產率之減低，一爲運輸機　之不健全，二爲電力之限制，三爲機械與技術之落後，爰就所見，約略述之：</p>
<p>（一）自商統會成立以後，物資交流之口號，尙未見諸事實，以故物物交換，僅屬空言；機製品旣未克暢銷內地，而內地之農產品，亦即工業上重要之原料，亦不易輪入。雖此中阻碍重重，困雞百出，惟交通運輸機構之不健全，與人事配合之不相稱，實爲最大原因。如何整飭精神，排除阻力，淸除弊　，俾少數分子把持之私利，摧陷廓淸？此爲商統會今日唯一之責任，不宜稍自諉卸。</p>
<p>（二）上海之存煤，據調查所得，足敷長時間之需用，且來源亦不虞缺乏；所有公家限制電力之規定，祇可施諸於消費機關，如娛樂塲所，飲食店館。不宜用諸於生產工廠，使之工作減少，發生工人失業之恐慌，此在商會商統會，與各同業公會聯合會方面，應速與當局切實磋商，分別辦理，俾增進工廠之生產率。</p>
<p>（三）技術之精研，與機械之改進，亦爲增進工廠生產率之要圖。希望各廠當局對於技術人才，不惜重紡，早早羅致，而於機械方面，更當推陳出新，不可蹈常　舊，故步自封，以阻遏本身業務之進展，此爲工廠當局急應覺悟之點，亦爲今日增進生產，減少失業之要圖。</p>
<h3>中交兩行組織　收購小麥貸款銀團</h3>
<p>全國商業統制總會，爲實行統二收買小麥，業經飭山粉麥專業委員會，擬訂小麥統買暫行方案，並經召開理監事聯席會議通過，粉麥專業委員會即根據方案規定，在蘇皖兩省主要產麥區內設立分辦事處九所，支辦事處廿所，實施辦理收買小麥工作，現正進行各地小麥行商資格登記手續，下月起即實施收買小麥，關於收買小麥資金問題，該會巳與中央儲備銀行，訂立協約，指定中國交通兩行貸款十萬萬元，以爲六七兩月份中收買小麥資金之需要。此項貸款，以承兌匯票方式行之，由粉麥專業委員會開發票據，授以各製粉廠，特由委託商及販買商而集中麥行，轉向產區收購小麥。貨主售得小麥款項之票據，可持向中國交通兩行貼現，中交兩行，則轉向中儲請求重貼現，至利息問題，目前正在洽商，日內即可具體決定。聞中交兩行，已組織收購小麥貸款銀團，並准予其他大陸，金城，浙江興業，浙江實業，上海商業，　業，中孚，國華，中南，華興等十餘家商業銀行，參加小麥貸款云。</p>
<h3>四明等四行　下月實行改組　中儲已準備接收官股</h3>
<p>國民政府爲健全華中金融機構起見，對於整理四明，中國通商，中國實業，中國國貨四行，使其完全滌除渝方色彩，業已派山財政部駐滬辦事處，及中央儲備銀行檢查金融事務處，會同檢查四行帳目完竣，呈經核准，予以改組，並決定四行處理要綱，及指派第一任董事監察人，幷指定中國國貨銀行董事長爲　扶霄，中國通商銀行董事長爲張文煥，四明商業儲蓄銀行董事長爲李思浩，中國實業銀行董事畏爲朱陳泉，該四行資本總額，各定爲四百萬元，全數收足，所有以前官股，由中央儲備銀行接收後，得出售與商民，使其成爲純粹商業銀行，並取銷其以前發行兌換　特權，茲悉該四行決定下月起，依法實行改組，按該四行除國貨外，本有小三行之稱，在過去握有發行權，範圍不少，派別各異，均由周轉困難，得前政府之協助改組，幷由前政府規定之國家銀行，分別負責管理，以收分工合作之效。其分配爲　中央管四明，中國管通商，交通管中實，上下各成一單位，稱爲姊妹行，其以小三行稱者，即係對大三行而言云。</p>
<h3>滬市上週　金融工商市况</h3>
<p>滬市上週間金融，與工商市况，因受一般流言之煽惑，投機商從中操縱囤積，突呈高漲之勢。週二週三週四情勢，扶搖直上，旋經有關各當局嚴密調查抑止，漲風始戢，各種市况，緊後轉鬆，因游資羣向投入農村，銀根較之益緊，惟以當局以及金融機關調劑有方，金融始終安定如恒。</p>
<h3>各業公會派員　密查抬價商號</h3>
<p>本市各業同業公會，均已分別組設「物品評價委員會」，從事評價工作，前後議定各該同業所經營之物品標準限價，均經當局核准施行在案，最近各業公會評價會根據各方報吿，以該業公會所屬之會員商號，並不按照限價出售物品，竟擅自將限價超越，冀獲非法利潤。如此非特違背該業公會評價規章，抑目有失評價宗旨，要求遣員密查眞相，嚴厲處罰，藉儆效尤，而安商市。今悉各業評價會有鑒及此，並爲一秉初衷起見，除樂於接受各界忠實檢舉外，一面已遣派人員密查眞相，如經查覺有違章買賣者，均將其牌號，地址，抄錄送會，由會公議處罰云。</p>
<h3>各業公會動態</h3>

<p>舊貨業　上海市舊貨業公會，自呈請主管當局，織組以來，現正積極辦即同業登記，凡經營舊貨買賣之商店，均得入會。查該業以廢物利用爲營業宗旨，完全適合戰時體制，該會父鑒於市上小押當，亦有兼營舊貨賣買者，故特訂定取締規則十條，嚴自約束云。</p>
<p>棉花業聯合會　棉花業同業聯合會，經會同商業統制總會，指定童侶靑等二十五人限期迅速籌備就緒，定於七月三日下午二時，假座華商紗布交易所舉行成立大會，屆時蘇浙皖三省及上海南京兩特別市地區內之棉花業，飛花業，及端花業，均須推派代表出席討論會章，推選首屆理監事云。</p>
<p>大衆生活</p>
<h3>書局職員的生活</h3>
<p>— 冠龍</p>
<p>我是一家規模很小的書局職員，過去店中的營業時問是從上午八時半至下午九時。足足十二小時半的工作，近來爲了電氣節約，及商塲普遍習慣，已將營業時間，縮短不少改爲上午九時至下午六時；早晚空閒的時間既這樣多，一班店員學徒，既各有各的事做了；我在繁忙的時候。每抽暇閱讀書報，現在更予我較充分的時間。來補充我的智識慾。店員的地位，雖是低微，但確是商業上直接的　動者。每日將和藹的態度誠懇的言語，所換得的，是買客的刁難，麻煩，和店主的無理譴責吧了。三餐一宿，是當然的酬勞，所得薪水，每月三十元，拿每日一元計算，輪到月份落在手背節骨的高峯上，就不到此數了。每當歲盡年凋的時候，照例是人們期待歡樂來臨的時期，而店家所給予勞力一年的店員酬金，僅相常平常的三倍强，這是我個人實際所獲，可不能與五金，呢絨，烟紙，行號的店員去比較，因爲少數行業，在崎形發展下，所獲暴利，當可提出千萬分之幾，給予店員。我們店中，規定早晚吃粥，中餐方吃米飯、或麵塊，在這樣艱危的時候。不能談到營養，只顧裝鮑肚子。雖然同事面部，多少帶　病態，但從無胃病發見，這也是差堪自慰的事。我們的　既無固定床位，更不論何種床墊，如玻　櫃面，長凳爲冬季良好臥室；暑季則多以水門汀爲　臺，舒適凉爽，爲一年中尋得好夢的時會。至於三十元的入款要使住人吃以外的事，支部得滿意，那是很難的，現在要求支配恰當，也就煞　心機了。爲了要保持外表整潔，理髮，整容爲必要之支出，服裝是無法添置的，爲了汚垢足以捐壞衣料的原故，只好勤加洗濯，　襪的折舊率，也就相當浩大交際。費捐款更不能逃避，因這是集體行動，我能一個人不參加嗎。我們以年終分紅爲最大收入，可是一年不如一年了，現在所入。較往年略有增加，但所換得的物質，反而减少了，譬如預計若干元，可購布質長衫一件，待領得紅金，布價却上漲了，我們無力囤積一件布質衣料，與貧苦之人，不能趁糧食低廉時購儲一些，是同病相憐的。我們的敎育程度，是顯然的不同，也是本國文字，多少都認識一些，因爲職業上的便利，只要不是過份的懶惰，和頭腦的低劣，做過三年學徒。總可以寫寫算算了。如果勤奮的人，也有擠身廣吿，畫家，與助理編輯之門的，爲了尋求知識，便應努力自修，爭取未來的光明。</p>

<h3>內容與形式－文藝寫作雜譚</h3>
<p>— 趙驤</p>
<p>形成一篇作品的是內容與形式。</p>
<p>什麼是內容呢？從生活經騐的歷練，在客觀現實的沃原中，揀選作品的素材——稱爲素材，是因爲還沒有經過作者剪裁，塑成一件藝術品的緣故。善通也稱之爲材料或題材，等到通過作者的主塑作用，加以適當的整理，精巧的概括，統一，再用文字具象的表現出來，　就稱　一篇作品的內容，也就成爲表現這作品的主題。</p>
<p>什麼是形式呢？是構成一篇作品聽整個創作過程的結果，是一個作者的藝術的表現能力，處理整個題材的手法，包括語言，結構，描寫，修辭等技巧。</p>
<p>作品的內容與形式，究竟應該何者重要？內容重於形式，抑形式重於內容，這　　來被熱烈的爭論着。有人以爲內容比較重要，內容充實，即使形式粗糙，也並不礙事，因爲內容彷佛血肉，我們所要吸收的就是那復面的滋養料；而形式不地是一個外表，外表粗糙，不會妨礙牠本質的精湛，若是徒具　煌的形式，而內容空處，明不是成了「架空」嗎？要是內容腐化，則被炫眼的形式誘惑，正足以服之中毒。但也有人以爲形式應該重於內容。他們的理由是：藝術作品是要適過作者主觀的溶躊，藉具體的形像來反映，要是作者沒有洗煉的技巧，豐富的字　，則很可能的，不能提煉出現實本實的精髓，明顯的將主題凸出，由於這種拙劣的技巧，貧乏的語　，即使有豐富的生活經騐本來是積極化的內容，也會晦澀而黯淡，瑣　的廢物雜然並存，正像三分金　被包於一天筐砂土中，這不是糟塌了題材嗎？反之有了精煉的技巧，即令平凡的題材，也會被作者渲染得出色，所以形式　重於內容。</p>
<p>以上兩種論點，不能說沒有相當的理由，但我覺得，不免都犯了只見對方而忘了自己的錯誤，都是片面的爲一方　　，一味強調內容而忽略形式，總　美中不足，一味注重形式而根本忽視內容，未免有「藝術至上主義」之嫌。我覺得內容與形式之間絕對不應有排他性，分離性，應該有機的聯　起來，統一起來。</p>
<p>由於這一原則的確立，一件藝術作品的成爲不朽與偉大，不僅在通過作者對現實認識的正確性的主觀作用，具象的表現客觀與實的作品主題的積極性，同時也是通過整個創作過程的結果而造成形式的完整與優美，藝術表現能力的強度，讀者的盛受性與教育效果如何，換句話就是作品的藝術價值。同一以農村爲題材的作品，　可因爲藝術表現能力的強弱，　出優劣之分，這可以用一個警喻說明：一塊精緻的美玉，一　技巧的彫刻家可以刻成一件偉大的藝術品，但落在一個粗　的石匠手裏，至多被造成一件普通的玩具。再說作者若沒有親身的經歷，實地的考察，深切的體味。沒有遠大銳利的目光，沒有豐富的幻想，生活拘　於一個狹小的圈子裏，即令在寫作的技巧上是達到圖熟的地步，但所抓取的題材的狹窄，不親切，也終於寫不出偉大的作品，正像拾起一塊朽木，妄想成衡世的珍品，也到底難外語爲力。</p>
<p>作品的內容與開工的關係是如此緊密。但事實上往往爲客觀環境自　能力等限制很難兩全，不是內容充實而形式粗糙，便是形式完整而內容平淡，　現象特別顯現於初學寫作的青年作品中是當然的，就是許多老作家也並不能毫無困難的將內容易與形式輕易調整統一。哥　克的過程中，不知遭遇了多少的波折，收集題材上的困難，技巧上的不愜，修辭的不　　，常常爲此而焦慮苦思，改正，重作，十多年後才告脫稿，計算各種草稿却堆有五六百頁之多，由此可知偉大作品固然在內容的生動精彩，揚溢着時代感，但形式的完事與精湛也是加增作品本身輝煌的江芒所不可少的。</p>
<h3>我的老師</h3>
<p>— 培基</p>
<p>大約是二年前吧！一個　秋的下午，北風括得正猛，老天又下着濛濛細雨，我趕緊吃了中飯，馬上挾了書包，提了一把雨伞，就向門外一溜，因爲下午一點半校中就要上課。</p>
<p>從家裏到學校約有半句鐘的步行距離，看了看錶，一點將　了。心中着了急，厲風又無情的把我的雨伞向左有</p>
<p>前後不停的吹動　。長　的下半截　都被雨水打濕了，又沒有直接的電車可搭，在無可奪回中，只好借助於人力車了，好容易以二塊錢的代價僱了一輛，教他向菜市路底拉去。</p>
<p>上了車，車夫吊上了擋兩布，只留了上面頭可向外面張望，雨水打不到了，連度又增加不少，渾身打個噤，覺得很是舒適，車夫不發一言，提起車把毫不猶豫的向前提起腿來就跑。雨點打在車篷上潑出淅淅瀝瀝單調的聲音，我身上向後躺着，聽日車輪作潺潺的激烈水聲，如道車夫跑得很快，老天　是黑壓壓的一片，柏油馬路洗得透明如鏡。向街上四面　去，每一樣東西——商店的招牌，　頂，汽車，電線，電車，人行道，雨伞等——都水光閃閃，濕得淋流漓難堪，</p>
<p>「黃包車！」每一個弄口，每一個街角，都傳出這粗燥的喚聲，扣人心弦。</p>
<p>轉瞬間，車子到了西門路口，在一個轉角上忽然我的視線捉住了前面一團模糊的背影，我的心不自主的跳動起來，仔細一看，他不是我們的英文教師姚先生嗎？下午第一課就是他來上課，他穿着破舊發油光的藏青　　西　，腳上穿着一雙大得不相　的橡皮套鞋，右手握着一布伞，左手挾了幾本書，他走着，踏着競走的步伐，頭也不回的向前走，風吹得緊時，他蹣　地把　斜的雨傘重表握正，那被雨點打濕了的褲腳管　貼　的　養他笨重的雙腿。</p>
<p>他在我的前面趕着，不停地揮動那巨大的橡皮套鞋；我們　距離漸漸的縮　了。我心跳　得更快，我　得不自在，不知怎樣地好，胸口裏無端地起了陣辛酸，我低着頭恐怕被他看見了。</p>
<p>「在這樣累人的天氣裏面，他爲什麼不僱一輛人力車？他不是有很厲害的胃病嗎？飯後激烈的步行，對他是有害無益的。他爲什麼不備一部人力車？」我自己不佳的忖慶着。</p>
<p>「嗚嗚！嗚嗚！」後而突然來了一輛流型線自備汽車，我的車夫來不及避讓，它已經以　人的速度，穿梭般的開到我的前頭，這設馬路積了些水，汽車胎立刻滾起了白茫茫的浪花，撲到我的車翼　上。</p>
<p>「他媽的！」泥濘的浪花沾濕了車夫的腰部，他放緩了腳步，狠狠地詛咒着。</p>
<p>啊！汽車的浪花撲到我的英文教師的褲腳上，他吃驚地要轉身避　。但已經滿腳污水涔　，他望了望二腳　，又蹣　着一聲不響地趕着路。汽車開得很遠了。四　還是濺着一大片　　白的水花，我憤怒着，咬牙切　　惟恨一切。我想讓給姚先生坐又不能我只得俯下了頭。閉着眼睛，不願回外再看。</p>
<p>我的車子逐漸追過了姚先生，不過他好像還是在後面毫不延擱地趕着。趕着……</p>
<p>學校到了，雨下得更大，我付了車資，回頭只見一片茫茫，看不見姚先生的一　半影，他落後了，他還在遠處趕影，進了課堂，已是一點二十五分，大部份同學都已到了，一般潮氣夾着人氣，撲鼻難受，室內喧嘩嘈雜，有的引吭高誦　文，有的問談着。</p>
<p>「姚先生又要遲到了！」</p>
<p>「恐怕他的胃氣痛又發作了吧！」</p>
<p>「今天的功課我沒有準備好，最好他能不來。」</p>
<p>我怔忡地　着，盤旋在我腦際的就是一第姚先生在路上和風雨掙扎的畫面；姚先生近來的確和從前不同這都是現生活的影響，雖然他還不到四十歲光景，已蒼老得像五十多歲的人了，從前他只教一隻中學英文，生活已過得去，現在要教三　日校和一隻夜樓，但每月還是入不敷出，每星期的教書鐘點超過四十個，自朝半晚，不得休息，精神委靡不堪，姚師母還得淘米洗菜，一切都親自下手，從前姚先生上課時，總是立在講台上，從不坐在上面，每天總是早到遲退，並且聲音洪亮，　　清楚，現在不　了，一切都和從前相反，他又有很重的胃疾，生活過不去時，　　時常復發作怪，在這種情形下，　他　　，太難辦了。</p>
<p>上課鐘敲過了五分鐘，還不見姚先生進來，大家等得不耐煩。有幾個同學開始離開教室。</p>
<p>忽然一陣沉重的腳步聲從室外傳來，大家斷定是姚先生來了，室內立刻　一得片肅靜，忽忽忙忙進來的正是我路上　見的姚先生。他在墻角上放了　濡的雨傘，關上了門，滿身濕得落湯　一般，面色慘白，呼吸急促，好像是一個賽跑選手到了長距離　走的終點似的，教室內靜默了約三分鐘模樣，沒人開口，姚先生在講台上向大家望了望，好像要開口說什麼似的，後來他　着教科書。</p>
<p>「今天要講的是"What　Career"一　。」他很　　的樣子。</p>
<p>「在沒有開始讀這篇的時候，我……有幾句話……要對你們說：」「他顫聲着，但顯得十分　決「這篇東西教你們將來揀……和你們興趣相合的……職業，但……不要上它的當，工作的酬報比興趣更重要。鈔票的力量最大……」　　「……我奉勸諸位……將來什麼事都可做，惟有教員不可當……我　緊了腰包餓肚來上課，沒有人來同情，家裏大哭小號，沒有人來理　……」他十分　　地說着，聲音響　。</p>
<p>「……你們看好莫不好笑，我當教書的却不能出錢使我的兒子受教育……」</p>
<p>「現在這　是……」他開始了今日的功課。</p>
<p>我看了看錶，離下課只有十分鐘了。</p>
<h3>都市裏的流亡羣</h3>
<p>— 宋濂</p>
<p>從廣東，從湖北，從北平，從南京，一羣羣遭受着同樣命運的人羣被毒索樣的交通綫綰連起來，無可遠抗地被擲進都市的黑烟囪裏！</p>
<p>趕着，趕着，一路被趕着，紅的太陽落下了，白的太陽又起來。青山綠水，黃瓦，白粟，一切都留在後面。草，木，花，蝶看來就本來祇是蒼茫的路傍的一些點綴，看看玩玩罷了。</p>
<p>到了，這是人生旅途上的一個小站，我們從蛇吐子裏攢出來，看着一些吐着迎接親人的期望的眼光，我們的心療傷了，簡直被搗成了粉末，思想　細碎的砂子，就向這粉末講明傾倒進去，凍結的水泥似的，我們忘記了一切，木然地站着！</p>
<p>火車都的開了，回向那可怕的洞穴裏去了吧！我們掉回了我們眼光，憎恨地注視着這一條黑莽蛇——</p>
<p>——啐，吃血的東西，遺棄我們的冷血蟲啊！</p>
<p>周遭是死樣地沈寂下來了。於是拖着鈴樣重的身子走出月臺，漫無目的地；單這彳亍的鞋音，佈一些凄苦的自然音韻，在這陌生的空氣裏。</p>
<p>在中國，流浪者是沒有俄羅斯人偉大的軀幹，圓臂膀，絡腮鬍子，和巨大的體憊的，他們祇能在街頭閒薄着，在一些大戶人家的後門口要一些食物，喂喂孩子還不夠哩！要是你想另謀發展吧，「吃那一路水啊」的霸道的聲音，就會像要吞食你整個身子——當然連討來的東西也在內——一他冒過來一面還很有路道地望望你們，指頭間揑出格格的聲音來。</p>
<p>做工吧！誰要你呢？憑你有牛樣的賤力，機器還不如你嗎。嘻！真是起碼人哩！人賤物貴，可是人是不吃人肉的啊，隨你賤到豬肉以下幾多倍也好。</p>
<p>進難民所去！每天在一些沒底的弄子裏打幾個轉，是地不下去的哪，一些孩子們還鬧的那麼的起勁。</p>
<p>報名，幾乎還像是要介紹哩。忍耐着，審問囚犯似的，過了個難關。生活着來能安定了吧！不！花像還多哩……熟識的人眼，看來又少了可是又怎樣呢，不吃飽該被餓死好多了。</p>
<p>兇惡的朋友，掛着漫長的「恩人」臉蛋地毫伏進走出，監視着一切。放心得了，我們是沒有家的，你們可也沒有貴重的東西啊可是恩人，一副恩相的恩人，又奈之何呢。</p>
<p>『揍他的，媽媽！你不是還靠着咱們這一羣活着的嗎，福氣活現的氣　，也該有個滿足的期限啊。』這傢伙遭打了我們這把拖出了，每人吐一口氣，憤火在燒啊！燒死了這傢伙！燒去這破碎的屋子！燒毀一切，連我們自已！</p>
<p>可是，像出了氣似的，人的氣憤是有限的，有人在勸了也，就完了這傢伙可沒被揍死。我們却受了虧了。</p>
<p>我們又被須安定的生活趕裏出來。墻邊，屋角，都有了我們的踪跡。我們也有富人的骨肉的，雖然這自然的酷　，比上爲的不週到一點兒。</p>
<p>再進難民所去吧，死了父母的孩子，死了孩子的父母，難民一天天多於一天了，流亡者啊？你們究竟有怎樣惡的命運呢，在流亡的生命線上每一個能同情你的人，却拿不出力量來啊！</p>
<p>人愈多，就愈亂啦，你的父親配了我的孩子，我的丈夫配了你的妻子，有空的時候再理吧，現在是顧不到這一切的，噯！外邊不是在捉流亡者的風聲嗎。沒有職業的，一串串被縛着，是羊？是牛？誰就不認識啦！反正就是沒有用的東西，下賤的東西，沒有漲價希望的東西，不能屯積的東西就是啦！</p>
<p>風聲更緊了，真有些拔出倒海，或者勞似破骨竹似的，一串串，一串串，一串串……</p>
<p>貴散，也就很把不的遺散了啦！就遺散了吧！</p>
<p>滬寗路上，天天，天天，擠滿着人，哭喪着臉，較來的時候苦多啦！</p>
<p>我們也被送上了車站，執了兩張很輕的鈔票。看看我們的服裝，看看我們的周遭，衣裳磨的更破舊啦，周圍的熟人又少啦；死了呢？還是在地球的另一個角落裏？誰也不能說，誰也不能說啊！</p>
<p>黑蟒蛇又來啦！這一回在太陽裏，更兇惡啦！可是也老了！</p>
<p>然而它的『老』是沒碍得的啊，幾百年後，當他死了的時候，他的屍首仍然可以在人的掌握下復活起來的啊，可是我們的親人呢。</p>
<p>我們又抓進它的肚子裏，像強投進沒有愛情的愛人的懷裏。都的一聲，可又去啦。</p>
<p>明天還不知後天，明年還不知後年，我將死了，戀人把我殺死的，不能說死得是冤枉的，因爲他還不是帶着我走的嗎。</p>
<p>又到了站頭，仍然從肚子裏鑽出來，仍然是爲看熱鬧而興奮的眼睛，仍然是迎接親人的熱望的眼光，我們的心是創傷了，可是一次又一次，這終是變的很　淡的了。</p>
<h3>黑暗中的前進</h3>
<p>— 胡明揚</p>
<p>啊！</p>
<p>這周遭怎麼是漆黑的一片，用盡了我們的目光，也看不見什麼。</p>
<p>怎的！</p>
<p>這道路是這般的崎嶇，</p>
<p>我們摸索着前進，</p>
<p>也免不了傾跌的危險。</p>
<p>聽！</p>
<p>海潮在洶湧。</p>
<p>那前面不是海嗎？</p>
<p>聽！</p>
<p>猛獸在咆哮。</p>
<p>那前面不是　野嗎？</p>
<p>聽！</p>
<p>還有那梟鳥的　呌，</p>
<p>魔鬼的笑聲。</p>
<p>這一切，使我們心寒膽戰，</p>
<p>使我們在前進的路上躊躇了。可是，親愛的別怕！</p>
<p>努力向前進，走過了這崎嶇的道路，</p>
<p>那邊是我們渴望着的世界，有幻想般地美麗，足使我們忘了酸辛。</p>

<h3>Commercial Control Council's Various Levels of Organizations Strictly Practice Self-Discipline</h3>
<p>The National General Association of Commercial Control was established to seek the reasonable supply and distribution of materials, so as to stabilize the people's livelihood. From the perspective of consumers, everyone is eagerly looking forward to the success of the Commercial Control Council's work. According to our ideal, even merchants, if they have a long-term vision, should also hope for the success of the Commercial Control Council's work. Because our traditional concept has always been to despise merchants. This time, the government resolutely handed over the power to control materials to merchants' autonomous organizations, which can be said to be an unprecedented initiative in Chinese history. The success of the Commercial Control Council can test whether our country's merchants have the ability to self-govern, and whether the country and the people can hand over this heavy burden to merchants to handle. This not only concerns the current fate of merchants, but also their position in future society. Secondly, merchants cannot exist independently from the entire society. If consumers are exploited to the point where they have no purchasing power, where will merchants sell their large inventories? If social order is disrupted because the majority of the people cannot withstand the high pressure of life, how can the minority who possess stolen wealth enjoy it peacefully? Lao Tzu said, "Excessive accumulation will inevitably lead to great loss." There is an ancient saying: "When a thousand fingers point, one dies without illness." Today's merchants' level of knowledge is far beyond what it was decades or hundreds of years ago. They should already be aware of their own interests. Therefore, we believe that merchants' expectations for the success of the Commercial Control Council's work are definitely no less than those of ordinary consumers.</p>
<p>However, in recent months, the reality has been the opposite of the ideal. Although the Commercial Control Council is a collective autonomous organization of merchants, the actions of merchants are contrary to the working principles of the Commercial Control Council. Taking the two major items of cotton yarn and cotton cloth as examples, the current price of cotton yarn has exceeded 100% of the price when the Commercial Control Council was established, and cotton cloth has also exceeded 90%. These yarns and cloths are all products that have been produced for a long time and have no cost relationship. It has only been a few days since yarn and cloth were allowed to move, and the amount of imports to the market is not large, let alone a supply and demand issue. Then, the reason for such a surge is obviously the speculation and manipulation by a small number of merchants who disregard the overall situation. Outside rumors say that the reason for the rise in yarn and cloth is due to the establishment of the Yarn and Cloth Joint Venture, which purchased a large amount of yarn and cloth on the black market. The shareholders of the Yarn and Cloth Joint Venture are all members of various trade associations under the Commercial Control Council's lower-level organizations. Therefore, whether inside or outside the industry, people speculate that the price increase is tacitly approved by the Commercial Control Council, and thus compete to search and purchase, gradually forming today's high price of yarn and cloth. If the rumors are true, we are really disgusted with merchants who forget righteousness for profit; especially for the Commercial Control Council, we express regret. The various lower-level organizations of the Commercial Control Council, such as the Federation and trade associations, are mostly established organizations. The Commercial Control Council has the right to supervise and direct its lower-level organizations. Why does it tolerate the pursuit of private interests by its lower-level organizations? Taking a step back, even if the Joint Venture did not purchase yarn and cloth on the black market, the price of yarn and cloth has risen so sharply. In terms of responsibility, the Yarn and Cloth Trade Association cannot but be responsible to the Commercial Control Council, and the Commercial Control Council cannot but be responsible to the people.</p>
<p>The authorities of the Commercial Control Council, whether they have appropriate emergency measures for the soaring prices of the materials they control, is unknown to the outside world, but what we cannot help but doubt is that the Commercial Control Council only has the power to supervise and direct its members, but no power to implement sanctions. At this time when a small number of merchants are profit-oriented and disregard everything, what means will the Commercial Control Council use to save this situation from collapsing? If the crackdown leads to the opposite result, the loss of prestige will be even greater. Japanese people regard the success or failure of the Commercial Control Council as a touchstone for our country's independent control and Japan's new policy towards China. The Japanese public opinion circles in Shanghai have repeatedly pointed out this in editorials, which is enough to represent their country's and people's close attention to our country's material control. The Commercial Control Council should feel how heavy its mission is, and how the government and the people should supervise and support it, so that the association can complete its mission. This is an important issue at present.</p>
<p>Control work is interference, restriction or management of people's economic activities. It is not easy to get understanding unless the people have a high degree of knowledge and can deeply understand the times and recognize the environment. In other words, it is extremely difficult to get every person to fundamentally abandon the idea of selfishness and benefit others and society, especially in Shanghai, which has been influenced by Anglo-American private interests. It is even more difficult to do so. For something that is extremely difficult to do, in a place that is extremely difficult to do, and the merchant group bearing this mission has no power to intervene, the completion of its mission is doubly difficult. However, since the control of materials is necessary for the times, and independent control is the ideal we have been expecting day and night, once it is realized, we can only unite from top to bottom, and do our best to promote it with a spirit that will never change until death.</p>
<p>From the government's point of view, first, it must not be the case that because the power of control has been given to the Commercial Control Council, it can be left alone from now on. If the goal of intervention is achieved, the most important thing is that it cannot be separated from coercive power. The government has never given this power to the Commercial Control Council, so when it is necessary to exercise this power, the government must of course use all its strength to shield the Commercial Control Council. Second, the government's order to investigate and deal with speculative hoarding has not yet dried, and the second wave of price surges has risen again. For the sake of the government's prestige, it seems that we must pay close attention to it. Third, China's economic problems are related to the economic problems of Greater East Asia. Japanese people have already said that independent material control is the touchstone of Japan's new policy towards China. The government seems to have to pay special attention to this. In wartime, the government can exercise special powers to stabilize the people's lives and maintain social order. What's more, the government has already promulgated various laws and regulations on dealing with hoarding and stabilizing prices. It only needs to follow the law, or further follow the suggestion of Mr. Inagaki, the chief of the Industrial Bureau's Material Control Department, and severely punish one or two of the most heinous criminals with extreme penalties. We believe that although these people value money, they also value life. They will never dare to be as rampant as they have been in the past. Even if the general price level cannot fall to the level we imagine, at least it will not surge as it has in the past half month.</p>
<p>From the people's point of view, the implementation of material control should have been led by the government, because control must take into account both producers and consumers. Only the government can be in a position to take both into account. The Commercial Control Council can only represent producers and sellers. No matter how fair its attitude is, there is a danger that it cannot take into account the opinions of consumers. What's more, since the establishment of the Commercial Control Council, the impression it has given us has been a tendency to not be able to take into account the interests of consumers. The pressure of life on ordinary people has already reached such a heavy point, and we naturally cannot remain silent on the issue of our own survival. What we rely on is the government. We ask the government to supervise and urge the Commercial Control Council to implement the method of self-discipline in the same industry. According to the regulations on the organization of trade associations, merchants engaged in a certain industry must join the trade association as members. According to the current organization stipulated for the implementation of material control, the trade association must be a member of the Federation; and the Federation must be a member of the Commercial Control Council. If the lower-level organizations of the Commercial Control Council can be responsible at each level and strictly practice self-discipline, then a small number of hoarders outside the industry will have no way to use their tricks, even if they are allowed to do so, they will not affect the market.</p>
<p>The editorial of the Continental News once said: "Unfortunately, recently, the internal members of the Commercial Control Council cannot understand the importance of their own tasks, and a dangerous tendency has occurred to promote the Commercial Control Council to become an organ that pursues private interests unscrupulously." The reason it cited was that it was rumored that the Commercial Control Council did not allow cotton yarn and cotton cloth to be transported to the inland, and in fact recognized the black market, hoping for illegal profits. From this, we can see how much the Japanese people in Shanghai value the work of the Commercial Control Council, and how bad the impression that soaring prices have left on the Commercial Control Council. Therefore, we deeply hope that the Commercial Control Council can quickly correct the past and pay attention to the future, so as not to cause more serious consequences, and that is not disappointing the ardent expectations of the government and the people.</p>

<h3>Chairman Wang Meets with Japanese Reporters Discusses the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere Each Independent Country Should Unite and Rely on Each Other Outline of the East Asia Alliance as the Basis for Establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Chinese government and the public have been deeply welcomed by the speech delivered by Japanese Prime Minister Tojo in the parliament. When reporters from the Japanese Allied Press Association visited President Wang of the National Government on the afternoon of the 26th to pay their respects, they also inquired about the President's views on the construction of Greater East Asia. The President granted them an audience and published a speech. President Wang praised the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere pointed out by Japanese Prime Minister Tojo in his speech. He also emphasized the importance of the four articles of the East Asia Alliance Outline and the New National Movement. The main points of the President's speech are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The present and future of Sino-Japanese relations: The fundamental revision of the Sino-Japanese Treaty is entirely due to Japan's goodwill, so China's waiting for Japan to specifically reveal its own views before stating its own views is a matter of etiquette. However, before this matter is realized, it should abide by the obligations of the existing treaty. According to my personal opinion (President's self-proclaimed), the various Sino-Japanese treaties can be roughly divided into two types due to the situation at the time of conclusion: one is to stipulate the relationship of permanent friendship and cooperation between China and Japan, which does not need to be revised in the slightest even today and in the future, and the other is to be concluded at the time when there were enemy countries such as Britain and the United States between China and Japan, which should be appropriately revised according to the objective changes of the times at present and in the future. Then the relationship between China and Japan will be able to restore its original posture, and be able to live and die together. Japanese Prime Minister Tojo has repeatedly mentioned this matter in the past, and I and senior officials of the National Government have also studied it, waiting for the opportunity to come, so that we can immediately respond when Japan expresses this goodwill. In order to adapt to this situation, we should do our best. As for the magnificent vision of the construction of Greater East Asia, and the agreement on the independence of Myanmar and the Philippines, we cannot imagine the joy of Myanmar and the Philippines. Other ethnic groups must also be full of infinite hope for the future. What I am most concerned about is the unique character of the so-called independence of Greater East Asia. The independent countries of Greater East Asia are united based on the concept of coexistence and co-prosperity, so there should be no confrontation and infighting between them. They should unite and unite based on the relationship of mutual dependence. However, although this matter can only be understood in theory, if we do not regard it as a practical problem and establish appropriate relationships with each other, it is difficult to realize the co-prosperity sphere. This is the reason why I previously established the East Asia Alliance and personally guided it.</p>
<p>(2) The East Asia Alliance advocates the four outlines as its proposition. I believe that these four outlines are very promising for application to the basic relations between the independent countries in the Greater East Asia sphere. The four outlines are briefly explained as follows: (A) Political independence, which goes without saying, is the confirmation of ethnic autonomy. Regarding internal affairs, we should govern ourselves according to the responsibilities and creativity of each ethnic group and each country. Japan has long advocated this, and has now solemnly put it into practice. (B) Military alliance, which is in concrete terms common defense. Each armed force often undertakes common tasks. It is natural that there are countries in a guiding position and countries in an assisting position, but this is not confrontation. Common defense is to make the guns of each country always point in the same direction, and the opposition of each country can be resolved. (C) Economic cooperation, if there is a sense of estrangement between countries in the economy, it is difficult to see the perfection of the relationship between countries, so the economic cooperation between independent countries should be reasonable and close, so as to remove economic opposition. (D) Cultural communication, its importance is no less than the above three things. I deeply believe that Chinese culture is sufficient to actively cooperate with Japanese culture to achieve the improvement of the entire Eastern culture. The East Asia policy of Britain and the United States is a colonial policy, so they adopt a fool policy for the indigenous people, but the gathering of fools is difficult to prosper and become a strong co-prosperity sphere. If there is no cultural exchange, it is difficult for countries in the co-prosperity sphere to understand each other and unite. I traveled to various parts of Southeast Asia thirty-two years ago. At that time, I witnessed the oppression of the indigenous people by the rulers, and they were miserable. Since then, I have been convinced that cultural communication is the element of uniting the ethnic groups of East Asia and solving East Asia. If these four outlines can be realized, the inequalities and dissatisfaction in East Asia will be resolved, and at the same time, the causes of opposition and struggle will be eliminated, and the countries of East Asia will be united and coexist and prosper with Japan, the guiding country. Therefore, I would like to propose these four outlines of the East Asia Alliance, fully cooperate with Japan's Asia-revival movement, and cooperate with each other to lay the foundation for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, but this matter has not been formally discussed with the General Headquarters of the Japan Asia-revival Alliance, but I hope that Japan will fully consider it.</p>
<p>(3) The New National Movement is also the basic condition for the construction of Greater East Asia, and its importance is no less than the above four items. We should guide the people, especially the young people, to carry out the New National Movement in both material and psychological aspects. This war is not a local war for the so-called conflict of interests, but a major revolution in the human world and a change in human life. In view of this, we should create a true Greater East Asian person who can shoulder the new Greater East Asia in the future. Currently, countries such as China, Japan, Manchuria, and Thailand are making every effort to promote the national movement, but judging from the current situation, they are all promoting it individually. In the future, it is necessary to promote it in cooperation with each other. All countries and ethnic groups in Greater East Asia should participate in this movement together, and promote this movement to establish friendly relations with each other. I often emphasize the three slogans of loving our country, loving our neighbors, and loving East Asia together, as the guiding spirit for the current National Government to promote the New National Movement. If patriotism is only for self-interest, it is not true patriotism. Only by loving our neighbors and loving East Asia can we be truly patriotic. This spirit is in full agreement with the establishment of Japan's family-style moral relationship and the spirit of universal brotherhood.</p>
<h3>Impressions of North China Representatives Attending the National Economic Conference Wang Yintai and Others</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Beijing – The second plenary meeting of the National Economic Commission has come to a successful conclusion. Although the meeting was only one day, the gains were quite substantial. Concrete decisions have been made on wartime economic policies and the entire economic reconstruction plan in the future. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Wang Yintai, Yin Rugeng, Zou Quansun, and He Tingliu to inquire about their impressions of attending the meeting and their personal aspirations for economic construction. The interviews are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Wang Yintai</p>
<p>The discussions at this meeting were very successful. All the resolutions are quite practical, and I firmly believe that economic construction in the future will be completed smoothly thanks to the resolutions of this meeting. I am especially pleased that the various issues related to North China that I raised have been successfully passed. I will also travel to Shanghai in the next few days to negotiate with the National General Association of Commercial Control on the issue of material exchange, so as to ensure the smooth flow of materials between the two places. Finally, when talking about the disaster situation in North China, it was said that the current authorities of the North China Political Affairs Commission have concrete measures to be decided, which are divided into two methods: fundamental treatment and symptomatic treatment. The wheat harvest this season is expected to be more abundant than last year, which can also slightly alleviate the panic of food shortages. I am deeply grateful for the central government's keen concern for the disaster situation in North China.</p>
<p>Yin Rugeng</p>
<p>North China is urgently seeking to increase fuel production, and is specifically developing coal deposits in Shanxi. Under the organization of the Shanxi Coal Mine Company, which is currently jointly operated by China and Japan, the capital of companies such as Baojin, Jianchang, and Shoutang in the past is merged. China and Japan each account for one-half of the joint venture, and the internal responsible personnel are also experienced people from China and Japan. There are currently about 20,000 miners, and the annual output has reached 1.5 million tons. It is expected that the annual output will increase to 4 million tons in four years. As for the issue of transport to the south, the first thing to solve is the means of transportation. If trains are used, it is too uneconomical, so in the future, it is planned to use the canal from Baoding to Shijiazhuang for transportation, and then transport it to the Central China area via the Grand Canal. The canal between Baoding and Shijiazhuang is currently being dredged, and more than one-half has been completed. It can be completed in one year.</p>

<p>I originally worked in Beijing, but now I live in Beijing. I feel very satisfied to participate in the conference in Beijing this time. It is expected that the smooth flow of material exchanges between North China and Central China in the future will not be difficult to gradually realize. Because the authorities of the North China Political Affairs Commission are currently planning relief policies, and the central government is also planning to revive the area urgently, the disaster situation in North China can be resolved soon. Moreover, the wheat crops this year are very abundant. It is expected that all the problems will be solved after the harvest. As for the food in the future, the authorities have an overall plan. In addition to strengthening control, they plan to do their best to purchase from North China, Manchuria, and Mongolia to make up for the shortfall.</p>
<p>Zou Quansun</p>
<p>This meeting has been very rewarding. All the proposals have been carefully discussed. In the future, when they are implemented, we only need to develop concrete implementation plans, and they will definitely be thoroughly implemented. I am currently the chairman of the North China Commercial Federation. From a commercial standpoint, the commercial situation in North China this year is worse than in previous years. In order to solve the current disaster problem, in addition to actively increasing production as a fundamental solution, it is also necessary to strengthen the control and rationing system in order to achieve a reasonable balance. Therefore, the North China control and rationing agency will be reorganized and strengthened soon. I also plan to travel to Shanghai with the two standing committee members Wang and Yin in the next few days to visit the organization of the National General Association of Commercial Control for reference.</p>
<h3>Progress of Political Economy in North China</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Beijing, 27th – The progress of North China since the entry of Sino-Japanese relations into a new stage is recorded as follows: (1) Price, food, and fuel issues. The North China Political Affairs Commission of the National Government previously established a Grain Supervision Bureau under the Price and Material Control Committee, and established Grain Procurement and Transportation Companies in various provinces and special cities. On the 5th of this month, it promulgated the regulations on limiting grain prices, and implemented a public pricing system from the 20th. As a result, grain prices have been falling day by day since the 6th of this month, and have now fallen to the same price as in March of this year. (2) Anti-communism issue. After the Communist Elimination Committee was resolved in a developmental way, a Communist Elimination Committee was re-established under the North China Political Affairs Commission of the National Government. The Political Affairs Commission and the New People's Association cooperated to take on the important mission of eliminating the Communists in the future. Communist Elimination Committee branches were established in various counties to launch a fierce struggle against the political offensive of the Chinese Communists. At the same time, the civilian self-defense paper weaving in Shanxi Province has been formed into a youth team, completing the anti-communist barricade. (3) Labor issues. The labor force required for the development of important resources such as coal, iron, and lime in northern Shanxi and western Shanxi is not difficult because northern China has always been known for its vast human resources. For example, under the joint efforts of Chinese and Japanese workers, the Datong Coal Mine has launched an increase production campaign, and has now broken through the scheduled output, causing the transportation sector to be unable to keep up. (4) Security situation. After General Pang Bingdong, commander of the 24th Group Army of the Chongqing government, and Generals Sun Dianying joined the peace movement, the Chongqing army, which used the Taihang Mountains as its base, completely collapsed. At the same time, the communist armies in eastern Hebei, northern Shanxi, and southern Shanxi were also destroyed, so the security situation has become increasingly consolidated.</p>

<h3>Myanmar Delegation to Japan to Depart Japan Today and Return South</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th – The Myanmar Delegation to Japan has been in Japan for half a month.

They exchanged opinions frankly during the meeting and had a very pleasant conversation. Group leader U Ba also spoke freely about his aspirations, saying that the brilliant literature of ancient Myanmar was suppressed under the tyrannical rule of the British and was difficult to develop. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it has been revived and gradually sprouted and developed. As if granting Myanmar independence, Myanmar's literature also gained independence. We are very willing to develop the independent Myanmar literature and hope that Japanese writers will give us their sincere cooperation, etc. The meeting ended at 2 p.m. Another group is scheduled to take a train west from here at 10 a.m. on the 28th to inspect the Kansai area.</p>
<h3>Appreciation from People in Various Parts of India for Japanese Assistance</h3>

<h3>Near Velikiye Luki, Soviet Troops Retreat after Suffering Losses in Attacks; Large-Scale War May Break Out Soon After a Long Period of Inactivity</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 27th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: According to a report from the Huitong News Agency, on Friday, fighting near Velikiye Luki was more active than in previous days. Soviet troops launched repeated attacks in the area, but retreated after suffering heavy losses. According to a telegram from a British correspondent at the Soviet General Headquarters, the British side seems to expect that a large-scale war may break out soon after the quiet on the Eastern Front. This telegram implies that the Soviet army is now actively consolidating its defensive positions and bases. The Red Army mouthpiece "Soviet Star" newspaper published a lengthy editorial warning the Soviet people not to underestimate the German military power, saying that the situation on the Eastern Front could change dramatically at any time.</p>
<p>Berlin, 27th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: Except for the area near Velikiye Luki, there are almost no large-scale battles on the Eastern Front. The German army remains silent before the start of the summer offensive. According to a statement by the German military authorities on the 26th, the war situation on the Eastern Front from the 19th to the 25th was described, stating that the German-Soviet war has entered its third year on the 22nd of this month. A forecast of the German-Soviet war situation is still not allowed. However, there is no doubt that the German army has greatly frustrated the Soviet military's combat effectiveness in the past two years. The main agricultural and industrial areas of the Soviet Union have also been occupied by the German army. There were no particularly noteworthy battles on the Eastern Front from the 19th to the 25th. It is expected that an unprecedented fierce battle will begin on the entire front as soon as summer arrives. The Soviet army has suffered heavy losses in the past two years, thus losing the initiative in the war. The Soviet army also admits that the German army does have a qualitative advantage. Even in terms of quantity, the German army now has the potential to match the Soviet army. The German army's mopping-up operations against Serbian guerrillas are progressing smoothly. In the past week, 10,000 guerrillas have been killed in battle. Although the anti-Axis air force has recently stepped up its indiscriminate bombing of German cities, the loss of enemy air force bombers is extremely huge. For example, on one day last week, the German air force shot down 70 aircraft in one fell swoop. On another day, 90 aircraft were lost. Therefore, even if the anti-Axis air force is extremely strong, it must recognize this situation. The damage to the German air force is extremely minor. This proves the high quality and technology of German air force personnel.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Powers Still Dreaming of Opening a Second Front; Anxiety Among British and American People About the Prospects of This Matter Is Increasing Day by Day; There Is No Confidence That an Invasion of the European Continent Can Succeed</h3>
<p>Amsterdam Central News Agency, 26th Electric Dispatch: According to a Washington report, President Roosevelt declared on Friday that his desire to open a second front is no less urgent than that of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 27th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: According to Huitong News Agency quoting Reuters' Moscow correspondent Jin, Moscow newspapers are now particularly publishing news that the British and Americans are preparing to accelerate the establishment of a second front. The reporter believes that the special record of this news in the Soviet newspapers shows the Soviet people's desire to establish a second front, so that the Soviet army does not have to suffer the German army's attacks alone when the German army launches an offensive.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 27th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: Huitong News Agency reported that although the anti-Axis powers' invasion of Europe is still the main topic of discussion in both the British and American systems, the anxiety about the prospects of this matter is increasing day by day. The British and American people are now beginning to ask questions, not only about the time and place of the invasion, but also about whether the invasion is possible and whether there is a chance of success. According to news from diplomatic and private sources in Lisbon, the question is whether the strength of the anti-Axis countries is sufficient to land in Europe and launch a real offensive outside the future sphere of influence planned in Moscow. Another question that is often mentioned is that even if the anti-Axis forces land successfully, their troops will lose more than half. If so, will this heavy loss not weaken the combat capability and domestic morale of the British and Americans? This estimate comes from British military experts and is by no means comparable to baseless ones. The final question is whether the British and Americans can really save the Soviet Union after landing somewhere in Europe. This includes the question of whether there are really enough ships and air force to attempt landings in several places at the same time. The British and Americans are also worried about whether the Soviet Union will fulfill its promise to launch an offensive on the Eastern Front when the anti-Axis forces risk landing. In addition, because the anti-Axis side has received news that the German side has built strong defenses on the European coastline in the past 18 months, they are skeptical whether this invasion can be realized this year. At present, one thing that the anti-Axis countries can be sure of is that they have experienced the strength of the European coastal artillery positions several times. British and American military commentators also warn their people not to think that the German military strength has been weakened by air raids and the Eastern Front war, and that a landing attempt can be easily completed. The British and Soviets seem to have different opinions on the future fate of Southern Europe, and the United States has not yet expressed any support for either side. Regarding Spain, British newspapers and radio stations often have dissatisfied comments about Franco. It is said that the British and Americans have asked Portugal to clarify its attitude. At the same time, news from North Africa and West Africa all say that the United States is now constantly expanding its influence there.</p>
<p>Italian Defense Is Impenetrable</p>
<p>Rome, 27th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: The Roman People's Daily published an article on the 26th discussing the situation in the Mediterranean and the possibility of launching a second front in Europe, stating that Italy's defense is impenetrable, meaning that the Italian front is the most important battlefield in Europe at present, but if the British and American forces attempt to invade Italy, they will encounter the greatest difficulties since the start of the war. The Italian army has made complete preparations for defending the outpost defense line of Europe, namely its own territory and territorial waters. The concentration of the most elite forces by the British and American forces to fight against Italy is for this reason. Even if the anti-Axis forces manage to establish a bridgehead on the Italian mainland and temporarily succeed, it will be far more difficult to continue to replenish their forces or expand the area.</p>
<p>Rumor Has It That German Troops Are Stationed in Northern Italy to Defend</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 27th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: According to a Washington report, it is rumored that several German divisions have been transferred to northern Italy to defend the passes leading to the Reiner Mountains in order to prepare for the anti-Axis forces' landing operation in Europe.</p>
<h3>Brazil and Bolivia Plan to Sign a Mutual Assistance Pact; A Trade Agreement Between the Two Countries Will Also Be Signed Soon</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 27th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: According to a report from the Huitong News Agency, Brazilian Army Minister General Dutra declared yesterday at the Brazilian Infantry Headquarters when he hosted a banquet for Bolivian President Manaranda that Brazil intends to conclude a mutual assistance treaty with Bolivia. Bolivian Foreign Minister Elio was also present at the meeting and expressed the hope that the two countries would cooperate more closely. At the same time, according to a statement by the Bolivian Ambassador to Brazil, a Bolivian-Brazilian trade agreement will be signed soon. The agreement will stipulate that the two countries will mutually export food and other products to facilitate production. A Brazilian bank will establish a branch in La Paz.</p>
<h3>Chilean Foreign Minister to Attend Parliament and Deliver a Foreign Policy Speech</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 27th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: Huitong News Agency quoted a Santiago report that Chilean Foreign Minister Fernandez will speak on Chile's foreign policy at a closed meeting of Parliament on Wednesday, and will specifically discuss Bolivia's request to cede the port of Arica. Regarding this point, political circles here pointed out that the Brazilian port of Santos has been used as a free port for Bolivia's use. The port is 1,000 kilometers away from the Bolivian border, so Bolivia can only use it occasionally.</p>
<h3>German Art Exhibition Opens in Munich; Propaganda Minister Goebbels Attends and Delivers a Speech</h3>
<p>Munich, 27th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: The German Art Exhibition was held here on the 26th. German Propaganda Minister Goebbels attended and delivered a speech, strongly arguing that Germany and Italy are defenders of traditional culture, and accusing the anti-Axis air force of bombing German cities, which is actually destroying European culture. He said that the United Kingdom and the United States claim to be promoters of human culture and loudly shout to the world, "We are the defenders of world culture," but the fact that the United Kingdom and the United States have made no contribution to culture is obvious. Only Germany and its allies are the true defenders of human culture. Hindenburg, Munich, Florence, and Venice are all the birthplaces of Western culture. The American continent is completely unworthy of mention in terms of culture. The American people cannot ignore the great achievements left by musicians Fedo Win Wagner and Michelangelo Borda Vinti. British and American people often say, "We are not fighting the culture of the Axis countries, but their institutions," but the British and American air forces are bombing cultural cities in Germany and Italy, destroying important works of art. Therefore, in this war, we should not only consider the material aspects, but also the life of knowledge, because art is the product of intellectual activity, but the British and American air forces are blindly bombing our art cities, and they actually want to destroy the German people's ability to gain knowledge. This inhumane atrocity by the British and Americans will only increase the German people's hatred of the enemy.</p>
<h3>This Year's German Grain Harvest May Be Expected to Be Abundant</h3>
<p>Berlin, 27th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: Huitong News Agency reported that this year's German grain harvest will be quite satisfactory. Due to the good weather, the harvest will begin three or four weeks earlier than last year. Barley and rye in several places will be harvested in the near future. Well-informed sources pointed out that if it depends entirely on the climate, the harvest will be excellent, but this summer is already the fourth year of the war, so there is a shortage of fertilizers and other items such as locomotives. Farmers have been encouraged to continuously increase the production of fat and the supply of milk. The production of cream has also increased from 425,000 tons in 1939 to 700,000 tons in 1942, but it is believed that it can still be increased. New regulations have now been promulgated, stipulating that farmers must supply a certain number of fattened pigs to the food market. Agricultural experts pointed out that the area dedicated to growing oil-bearing fruit trees has increased by 100% compared with before the war, with a total of 1.2 million acres, and will be further expanded this year.</p>
<h3>Berlin Political Circles Attach Importance to Gill's Visit to the United States</h3>
<p>Berlin, 27th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: German News Agency reported that President Rocheford's invitation to Gill to visit Washington has aroused considerable attention in Berlin political circles, who believe that this is a symbol of Roche's renewed interest in North African affairs, and believe that the United States may increase its influence in that area after the recent British king's inspection of North Africa.</p>
<p>Anti-Axis Aircraft Bomb Italian Cities</p>
<p>Rome, 27th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: Yesterday, the Italian General Headquarters announced that on Friday, anti-Axis aircraft bombed various Italian cities, resulting in 93 deaths and 99 injuries. 81 people died and 85 were injured in Messina, 10 people died and were injured in Bari, and 2 people died and 4 were injured in Vizaini.</p>
<h3>British Air Minister Flies to Gibraltar to Change Shoes</h3>
<p>Madrid, 27th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: According to news received here from Rari, British Air Minister Sinclair arrived in Gibraltar by plane yesterday. The purpose of this trip and how long he will stay have not been revealed.</p>
<p>Madrid, 27th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: According to news received here, several British naval warships arrived in Gibraltar yesterday. In addition to destroyers No. 21, No. 30, No. 64, and T63, and those announced on Friday, the current ships moored in the port include two British aircraft carriers and cruisers, multiple destroyers, two French destroyers, and one Polish destroyer. The naval artillery positions in Gibraltar continued to hold exercises yesterday.</p>
<h3>Turkey's Attitude Towards the Anti-Axis Powers Has Become Cold</h3>
<p>Basel, 27th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: Huitong News Agency reported that the Basel News reporter in London said that Turkey's attitude towards the United Kingdom and the United States has changed recently. Turkey has repeatedly stated that it is willing to participate in the anti-Axis powers' post-war peace conference, but recently, as the intentions of the United Kingdom and the United States have gradually become clear, its attitude has become cold. At the same time, its attitude towards the Axis powers has shown signs of rapprochement. This can be seen from the grand farewell ceremony for the Turkish military delegation to Germany and the remarks in Turkish newspapers. Esmo, a commentator for the Urus newspaper, recently said that in addition to waging a war of nerves against the Axis powers, the anti-Axis international powers obviously have no proper preparation for a real landing in Europe. Does Turkey feel skeptical about the victory of the anti-Axis powers? Or is it that the price offered by the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union for opening the Dardanelles Strait seems insufficient? This will have to be proven by future facts.</p>
<h3>British Side Quite Uneasy About Bose's Appearance in Tokyo</h3>
<p>Gunsben, 26th, Central News Agency Electric Dispatch: The London Times recently published an article entitled "Jiangtela Bose in Tokyo," and the lines were quite uneasy. The general idea was that the Axis newspapers were very expectant of the future activities of Mr. Jiangtela Bose, the former speaker of the All-India National Congress.</p>
<h3>Japanese Submarines Show Their Power in the South Pacific</h3>
<p>(○○ Base, Special Correspondent Hirate Dispatches) After annihilating the enemy fleet in the Solomon Islands, the Japanese commerce destruction war, which unfolded with the vicinity of Australia as its stage, is now challenging in the Solomons and New Guinea, threatening the US-Australian supply base war. The enemy's transportation line's sense of terror is rising. The brave Japanese iron whales, with Sydney as the center, appear and disappear mysteriously in the enemy's transportation network, repeatedly avoiding the enemy's aircraft and destroyer eyes and ears, and in a short period of several days, achieved the great achievement of sinking six general transport ships fully loaded with military supplies, 54,000 tons. On a certain day of a certain month, they again broke into a large transport convoy protected by two destroyers, and at the same time, buried two cargo ships fully loaded with military supplies on the seabed, fully displaying the power of our world-class submarines. What should be remembered here is the hardship of the submarine crew members who penetrated deep into the enemy's陣, overcame the bad air of long-term submarine navigation, and waited day and night under the enemy's sea and air control sphere to attack enemy ships. Enemy merchant ships now also have the offensive power of cannons and bombs, which is completely different from the past. Destroying commerce and attacking warships is not easy to achieve. The fighting spirit of the crew members who broke through all the hardships and dangers and forgot everything and moved forward wholeheartedly is truly the flower of the Japanese Navy and the pioneer in destroying the United Kingdom and the United States. The following is a record of the actual combat of a certain submarine.</p>
<p>Heading south along the coast of Australia, the glare of searchlights was active everywhere on the surface of the sea. Australia in this season has very long daylight hours, and the daily schedule is reversed day and night. Breakfast is at 4:30 in the afternoon, lunch is at 12:30 in the middle of the night, and dinner is at 4:30 in the morning. During the day, the air is extremely turbid due to long-term submarine navigation. Crew members who are not on duty during the day take this opportunity to get plenty of sleep in preparation for their nighttime activities. When the hull floats to the surface of the water, the captain, having become accustomed to night vision, personally encourages the lookouts on the bridge to continue searching for the enemy without懈懈. On a certain night of a certain month, the first thing to enter the field of view was a cargo ship of the 8,000-ton class, advancing leisurely under the moonlight. So we launched a torpedo at the enemy ship. It hit the central part of the enemy ship, and the engine room exploded, suddenly rising. The violent water column immediately disappeared into the white smoke screen. The enemy ship clearly issued a distress signal, and the fast-footed crew members appeared with miniature lamps in response, vying to board the small boat, but the port side of the small boat was also unexpectedly hit by a torpedo, tilted sharply to the right, and soon the starboard deck was flooded and gradually submerged in the water.</p>
<p>The next day, we advanced to the enemy land again and encountered an 8,000-ton-class oil tanker. A torpedo hit the stern, and a fierce fog of steam was ejected. The stern began to sink. A few minutes later, the enemy dropped a torpedo. Upon seeing our ship floating to the surface of the water, the cannons on the bow immediately opened fire, making a final struggle. But the enemy ship gradually tilted its bow upward and its stern downward, and sank sideways into the sea.</p>
<p>Breaking into the Enemy's Alert Network</p>
<p>After sinking a ship in this vicinity, the enemy's vigilance naturally became more stringent. Especially since this place is quite close to the Australian coast, in order to break through the enemy plane's哨戒, we turned to a certain direction, and first encountered an enemy destroyer, so we advanced again in a certain direction, and again discovered a逐艦, but our ship disregarded everything and broke into the enemy's tight防禦圈.</p>
<p>This eye-to-eye struggle, its victory, is absolutely ours. Because we are well-trained on weekdays, we have already discovered the enemy ship. We skillfully concealed our 所在, but the enemy is still blindly searching.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, we heard the sound of torpedo explosions from afar, and the crew members' faces showed knowing smiles. That night, we encountered an enemy destroyer again, and when we turned around, we encountered two more. Above, in the picturesque moonlight sky, enemy aircraft were巡迥哨戒. But our ship was not discovered after all.</p>
<p>If we floated to the surface of the water, we would definitely encounter a躯逐艦. Although the sea is wide, we broke into a narrow surface of water where there was almost no room to stand. After attacking after breaking into the enemy's heavily guarded哨戒綱, knowing that this was a desperate adventure, the entire ship was invigorated, waiting for the next opportunity. The captain屝息凝神 was extremely nervous. The hull had been floating for a long time during the day. In the raging waves, although we knew we were no match, the crew members still took turns sunbathing to nourish their new offensive power. That日 at dusk. A heavy rain poured: covering the sea, and suddenly a 10,000-ton-class cargo ship appeared in the rain. It was sailing leisurely as if nothing had happened. We waited until nightfall to attack. Lun's machine room, the machine stopped immediately, and used merchant ship radio waves to send an SOS rescue signal to show its location. Because it was not easy to sink for a while, we continued to launch torpedoes at it, and finally the bow was upturned. The stern gradually went down, and the giant body sank to the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>Capturing a Large Transportation Convoy</p>
<p>After this, because there was no good opportunity, we continued to patrol the ocean. On a certain night of a certain month, we caught a large transport convoy formed from Melbourne heading to Sydney. There were ten 8,000-ton-class cargo ships and two destroyers escorting them. They did not know that we were going to launch a surprise attack. When approaching in the misty smoke, the attack was very difficult due to poor visibility. If we waited until dawn, there might be changes, so we resolutely broke through the alert line of this destroyer. At this time, as if aided by a god, the cloud formation above the convoy suddenly cleared, and Orion's three stars were beautifully shining in the sky. These many ships reflected in our periscope became a团, and then the attack began. This can truly be said to be a miracle. The torpedoes launched one after another hit two enemy ships at the same time. One immediately caught fire, illuminating half of the sky and the sea. In the fire, the other was tilting to the right and sinking. The ships, bewildered by this sudden change in the朦朧, instantly became confused and scattered, fleeing. This great achievement of sinking two ships at the same time was only possible because of the 　越 skills of our submarine captain.</p>
<p>Continuing on a certain evening, a 12,000-ton-class cargo ship fell into the net we set up. There was no moon, and in the pitch blackness where you could not see your fingers, we discovered this giant ship. We went around to its front, waited for dawn, aimed at the rear of its machine room, and fired a torpedo below its chimney. We only heard a loud explosion. The huge boat also sank into the裏. Not long after the launch, the enemy卞飛行艇 soon flew to the scene of the incident, landed on the water, and began to rescue.</p>
<p>Soon, we received a congratulatory telegram from the headquarters, congratulating us on the great achievement of sinking six enemy ships, 54,000 tons. The telegram said: "Congratulations to a certain submarine for achieving a great achievement in a short period." The morale of the crew members on the ship became even more invigorated.

<h3>Actively Dredging Sources to Maintain the Supply of Oil and Sugar in the City</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Edible Oil Trade Wholesale Office and the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office, in order to maintain the proper need for oil and sugar, handle the distribution by population and the special allocation required for various industries. Yesterday, a Shanghai News reporter learned the details from relevant parties as follows:</p>
<p>Today's Oil Sales in West Shanghai and Other Areas</p>
<p>In addition to edible oil being ordered by the military authorities from Dalian and other places, raw materials such as soybeans, rapeseed, peanut cotton seeds, etc., are also supplied to various oil mills in Shanghai. The oil pressed by each factory is purchased and handed over to the edible oil wholesale office for allocation. The fourth phase of edible oil is scheduled to begin today, and purchases can be made with housing donation tickets and household registration certificates. Each person is limited to four taels, based on the number of rice recipients behind the housing donation ticket or the number of people listed in the household registration. The number of people in each household should be purchased all at once and distributed evenly, and no deduction is allowed. This time, Nanshi, West Shanghai, and Pudong districts will start selling first today until July 7th. The other districts of the Public Concession, French Concession, Hongkou, and Zhabei will be delayed for a few days before sales begin because the delivery procedures cannot be rushed.</p>
<p>Ordering Taiwan Sugar to be Shipped to Shanghai for Relief</p>
<p>Sugar is submitted to the military authorities by the cooperative on a regular basis for approval to handle sugar distribution by population and special allocations. Although the sugar reserves are less than before, the authorities have ordered sugar from Taiwan to be shipped to Shanghai for relief, so it will be possible to maintain it for a long time. The fourth phase of household sugar has been widely sold by retailers since the day before yesterday until July 5th. However, the urban area was originally scheduled from the 21st to the 30th. Due to the slow delivery and inability to start as scheduled, the Food Bureau has announced an extension to July 3rd. As for the special allocation required for the business of various industries, the payment has been cleared to the cooperative with the approved notification letter a few days ago, and it can be collected from the designated B-type retailers, but it is stipulated that it is only for personal use and not for resale. Violators will be permanently suspended from allocation. In addition, retailers who sell edible oil and sugar have been strictly managed to prevent malpractices.</p>
<h3>Japanese Language Teacher Training Class Closing Ceremony, Mayor Chen Attends and Delivers Instructions</h3>
<p>The first Japanese language teacher training class for primary and secondary schools, organized by the Municipal Education Bureau, began on May 1st of this year and has now reached the end of its two-month term. The closing ceremony was held at 11:00 AM on the 27th in the auditorium of the Municipal Government. Director Lin presided over everything in his capacity as chairman of the association. In addition to the 80 trainees, Mayor Chen, Section Chief Arita of the Japanese Embassy, the chairman of the Japanese Language Research Association, and representatives from the Japanese Navy Reporting Office, and dozens of others attended. First, Mayor Chen gave instructions, followed by a speech by Director Lin, who also served as chairman, and then a congratulatory speech by guest Section Chief Arita. Finally, trainee representative Tang Fuxiang gave a reply, and the ceremony ended. After the photo, everyone had a lunch party. In the afternoon, a tea party for teachers and students was held, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Total Coal Reserves in the City Exceed 500,000 Tons</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a Shanghai News reporter learned from reliable sources that there is no shortage of fuel supply for factories, restaurants, and residents in the city. The total amount of coal stored in warehouses in Pudong, Hongkou, West Shanghai, and the French Concession is about 500,000 tons. Based on the current usage, this amount of coal is enough to meet the city's needs for half a year. Moreover, industrial, livelihood, and household users are fully allocated by the authorities on a regular basis, and there is no need to purchase additional coal at high prices. The recent difficulty in purchasing coal briquettes is a temporary phenomenon and will soon return to normal because the manufacturing plants are repairing machinery and reducing production. At the same time, the authorities will strictly and effectively implement the standard price limit for coal briquettes. If there are any overcharges, residents can report directly to the authorities for investigation and prosecution in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Strict Inspection of Public Places in the City</h3>
<p>The city authorities believe that Shanghai is a mixed city of Chinese and foreigners, and the quality of people varies. Criminals are inevitably hidden in public places. They have ordered the responsible parties to organize patrol teams and plainclothes teams to be dispatched day and night. Anyone who is suspected will be detained for interrogation, but no deliberate delays or solicitations for bribes are allowed. Those who dare to violate will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Director Feng of the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office Broadcasts a Speech Yesterday</h3>
<p>Feng, Director of the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office, was invited by the Shanghai Anti-British and American Association to deliver a broadcast speech at the Shanghai Broadcasting Station from 9:30 PM to 10:00 PM yesterday (the 27th). The topic of his speech was "The Mission of the Film Industry in the Future." Excerpts from his speech are as follows: "The future film industry should move towards the following goals: First, establish a Chinese-oriented film. Film is culture, a culture with its own unique characteristics in a country. The Chinese film industry should fully express the characteristics of Chinese films. We have our own style, we have thousands of years of cultural history, and there is no need to be Westernized to be modern or progressive. Therefore, Chinese films in the future should no longer be prisoners of Britain and the United States, but should be free and liberated. Modern culture is a common civilization of the world, and we can accept it. Modern tools for food, clothing, housing, and transportation can be used, but the gestures, movements, and thoughts must absolutely eliminate the toxins of Britain and the United States. Our film industry is determined to be Chinese and completely wash away this shame. Second, create films that educate the public. The film industry should strive to contribute to the sacred mission of the country and the current situation, not to provide the public with cheap entertainment to relieve boredom. It should increase the public's knowledge and improve the public's cultivation. The general audience should respect the sacred mission of the film industry and accept its education, and should not expect low-level interests from the film. Our film industry is also determined to carry out its sacred mission in the future and provide the public with the right path in life."</p>
<h3>Expansion of the Hobby Exhibition to Collect Rare Treasures, to be Held in Mid-July</h3>
<p>Celebrities in the city, Wen Yunting, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Ding Fubao, etc., in order to inspire contemplation, cultivate sentiment, and provide for archaeology and appreciation, have launched a major expansion of the hobby exhibition. They are currently collecting rare treasures from all dynasties collected by hobbyists, such as currency, models, curios, ancient coins, banknotes, photographs, bonsai, religion, oil paintings, documents, stamps, ancient and modern calligraphy and paintings, exquisite decorations, and transformed birds and beasts. Preparations are currently underway. The official exhibition date is set for mid-July. If there are any collections that you are willing to exhibit publicly, please contact the preparatory office of the Shanghai East Commune at No. 514 Fuzhou Road. It is said that this hobby exhibition will be expanded, and the exhibits, though as large as bells and tripods and as small as millet grains, will be fully equipped, and a number of items will be designated for charity sales to raise donations for the urgent needs of North China.</p>
<h3>Simplification of Clothing Movement, Chinese People Will Also Launch</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Continental News, since the Japanese residents in Shanghai decided to launch a clothing simplification movement in response to the decisive battle clothing life movement in their home country, the General Mobilization National Salvation Association decided that men's summer clothing should be collared shirts and shorts, and no long socks should be worn, etc. After the news spread, the Chinese side also took similar measures to launch a clothing simplification movement as part of the New National Movement. Because in the current state of high prices, it is impossible and extremely inappropriate for Chinese people to wear new clothes from head to toe. Now that the foreign residents of Shanghai have launched a clothing simplification movement, our compatriots should reflect on it in time and learn from the foreign residents to launch a clothing simplification movement as one of the guiding principles of the New National Movement.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Magazine Federation to Hold Inaugural Meeting Today</h3>
<p>Responsible persons of various magazines in the city believe that the periodical industry is an important part of a country's culture.

Preparations have now been completed, and the inaugural meeting will be held at 2:30 PM today at the Qingye Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road. Officials from the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office of the Municipal Government, the Embassy, the Army Reporting Department, and the Navy Reporting Department will be invited to attend and provide guidance, and people from the cultural and news circles of the city and related parties will be invited to attend.</p>

It is learned that the Jiaxing Police Section has been fully prepared and officially started serving a few days ago. Chen Guozhang has been appointed as the section chief.</p>
<h3>Vendors Carrying Heavy Objects are Not Allowed on Trams</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tram Company has repeatedly tried to improve the crowded conditions of running vehicles in the past. According to reporters, the company believes that the congestion of passengers is mostly caused by vendors carrying objects. It has now been decided to strictly prohibit vendors from carrying objects on the tram. Since yesterday, each tram conductor has been individually responsible for not allowing vendors to carry heavy objects on the tram, especially strictly prohibiting the carriage of heavy objects such as rice oil, cotton yarn, and beans, as well as controlled items.</p>
<h3>Taxi Licenses for the First Half of the Year Still Valid Until the End of July</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department recently issued Announcement No. 6403, stating that the validity period of all private rickshaw licenses for the first half of this year will be extended to July 31.</p>
<h3>Hu Jiabao Appointed as Lawyer Representative of the Public Works Department's Legal Department</h3>
<p>Since the Chinese lawyers Li Tanshan and Fang Fushu successively resigned from the Legal Department of the Public Concession Public Works Department, the original lawyers felt that the division of labor was insufficient in performing their duties. The bureau has now promoted Hu Jiabao, a secretary of the Legal Department, to be the department's representative lawyer. Hu graduated from the Law Department of Dongwu University and has officially taken office.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Security Gets Criminals, to be Transferred to New Detention Center</h3>
<p>The new detention center of the Municipal Security Department has long been completed, but there are no suitable office premises in the detention center's building. Therefore, it has been determined to convert the houses of Jinkangli on Zhonghua Road into offices. It is learned that all the residents in the houses have expressed their willingness to move out automatically within two weeks. Once the residents have moved out, construction will begin immediately so that all detainees can be transferred to the new detention center within a short period of time.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>Youth Association College Advancement Lecture: The Youth Association of this city will hold a week-long college advancement guidance lecture starting today.

<h3>40th Phase of Household Rice, Rice Shops Will Receive Purchase Orders Today, Outstanding Payments from the Previous Phase Will Be Paid at the Same Time</h3>
<p>The implementation of the distribution of food by population in the Public Concession and the French Concession has been quite effective. In the future, we will continue to handle it with the original intention to maintain people's food. Regarding the price issue, after two adjustments by the authorities, the 39th phase was changed to 450 yuan per stone, but the purchase price of the rice shops at all locations remained the same temporarily because the preparation of the procedures was not timely. For the 40th phase of household food, sales will be allowed from July 2nd to the 9th, and the purchase price of the rice shops is stipulated to be 450 yuan per bag. However, the outstanding payments from the previous phase, as notified by the Allocation Office, will be paid when the 40th phase is paid, so the rumor that the purchase price of rice shops will increase is actually a mistake of paying the outstanding payments. As for the purchase orders for the 40th phase of household food, they will be allowed to be collected today (the 28th), and the payment must be paid within a time limit to pick up the goods from the designated warehouse in order to sell them on time in accordance with the methods announced by the authorities. However, the matching number of rice flour in the next phase and the selling price are still subject to the official announcement of the authorities.</p>
<p>The Spread of Leprosy: According to the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association, the total number of leprosy patients in the city is about 3,000.

The deadline is set for the end of this month.</p>
<p>Pude Association Raises Funds for Disaster Relief: The Shanghai Pude Association, in view of the serious disaster situation in North China, believes that human beings should have mutual assistance obligations. The directors of the association have made separate appeals to relatives and friends, and have raised more than 14,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. The association has raised 20,000 yuan in total and will send all the money to the Buddhist Benevolent Association immediately, and the association will directly send personnel to carry out the relief work on the ground.</p>

<h3>Shen Bao Cup Basketball Tournament, Zhong Qing Beats Xi Qing 15 to 12, Tonight's Final Duel, Early Start at 7:30 PM, Auction of Charity Balls and Award Ceremony</h3>
<p>The Shen Bao Cup North China Disaster Relief Charity Basketball Tournament, co-sponsored by Zhong Qing and this newspaper, opened the curtain the night before yesterday. Zhong Qing relied on the soldiers to use their lives and won the first battle with a score of 21 to 18. The second act continued at 8:00 PM last night, and Zhong Qing once again met Xi Qing.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Audience Was Even More Crowded</p>
<p>The audience was so crowded that it was impenetrable, with an estimated number of more than a thousand people. At the start of the game, Tao Bolinji and Kai Qimi Luofu of Xi Qing were late, and only a partial force was able to fight in the first half, so they were deeply immersed in a depressed atmosphere. However, after a fierce battle, they were finally able to catch up to a very close situation. Zhong Qing only scored one point in the second half, which also shows the tension of the battle process and the extraordinary strength of Xi Qing. Unfortunately, due to too many losses in the first half, Xi Qing suffered another defeat with a difference of three points, with a score of 12 to 15.</p>
<p>Basketball Auction Sets New Record</p>
<p>During the break, a charity ball auction was held, hosted by Chen Bin. The bidding for the charity ball was enthusiastic, and Wen Lanting finally won the bid for 32,000 yuan through the Jimude Hall and was collected by representative Gu Gongmo. It set a new record for the highest price in the basketball charity sale. The enthusiasm is truly rare.</p>
<p>Zhong Qing Leapfrogs in the First Half</p>
<p>Referee Liu Hesheng blew the whistle to start the game, and the war broke out. Due to the absence of the main generals, Xi Qing had to fight with a partial force. On the Zhong Qing side, Lin Weicong took the lead in scoring, and Zhang Jinshuan and Yu Ziyu followed up one after another. After a while, Xiaolin also succeeded, and the scoreboard already hung high with eight points. Xi Qing fought hard and finally broke the duck egg with Ye Long's success. However, before long, Jin Xuan revisited the old place and the score increased to 10 to 2. Tao Bolinji and Kai Qimi Luofu arrived late and joined the battle. After Tao Bolinji made a penalty shot, the first half ended because the position was not solid, and Tang Xuesheng and Yu Ziyu scored two more points, with Zhong Qing taking an unparalleled advantage with a score of 14 to 5.</p>
<p>Xi Qing Intensifies Counterattack in the Second Half</p>
<p>The sound of the Western War rose, and Xi Qing fought with the most standard lineup, and the fighting power became more active. Bo Tuo took the lead, Kai Qi also made a penalty shot, and Sa Sijin also succeeded. In a flash, he scored five points in a row. At that time, Xi Qing's offensive was at its peak. Zhong Qing repeatedly missed the target, but because Xi Qing was too hasty, every throw was in vain. Although the battle was tense, the harvest was fruitless. Until the last two and a half minutes, Yu Ziyu made a penalty shot due to Bo Tuo's foul. After Zhong Qing won this precious point, it changed to a slow offensive strategy to maintain the victory. Xi Qing was explored by Sa Sijin, but because time was running out, he was defeated with a score of 12 to 15. Zhong Qing announced a winning streak. It is also learned that Tan Xingbo, the manager of Zhong Qing, will host a banquet tonight to reward the division in order to celebrate the victory.</p>
<p>Tonight is the Final Battle Between the Two Teams</p>
<p>Tonight is the last act, and the game will start early at 7:30 PM. After being frustrated, Xi Qing must try to turn the tide, and the tense situation can be predicted. The charity ball will still be auctioned tonight, and an award ceremony will be held.</p>

<p>Economic Circle Commentary</p>
<h3>How to Remedy the Defects of Production Enterprises</h3>
<p>Recently, a bad phenomenon has been discovered in society, which is the increasing number of unemployed people. Although the reasons are not limited to one end, the reduction of factory productivity is a major cause, resulting in more and more shutdowns and wage reductions. Not only can new workers not get a foothold, but also the original workers are gradually eliminated. This is one of the most worrying things. The reasons for the reduction of factory productivity are: first, the unsoundness of the transportation mechanism, second, the limitation of electricity, and third, the backwardness of machinery and technology. Therefore, I will briefly describe what I have seen:</p>
<p>(1) Since the establishment of the Commercial Control Council, the slogan of material exchange has not been seen in practice. Therefore, the exchange of goods is only empty words. Machine products have not been sold smoothly in the inland, and agricultural products in the inland, which are also important raw materials for industry, are not easy to import. Although there are many obstacles and difficulties in this, the unsoundness of the transportation mechanism and the inconsistency of personnel cooperation are the biggest reasons. How to rectify the spirit, eliminate resistance, eliminate malpractices, and destroy and eliminate the self-interest of the minority? This is the only responsibility of the Commercial Control Council today, and it should not be shirked slightly.</p>
<p>(2) According to the survey, the coal reserves in Shanghai are sufficient for a long time, and there is no shortage of sources. All the regulations on the public restriction of electricity can only be applied to consumer institutions, such as entertainment venues and restaurants. It should not be used in production factories to reduce their work and cause the panic of workers' unemployment. The Chamber of Commerce, the Commercial Control Council, and the Joint Association of various trade associations should quickly consult with the authorities, handle them separately, and increase the productivity of factories.</p>
<p>(3) The refinement of technology and the improvement of machinery are also important ways to increase the productivity of factories. It is hoped that the factory authorities will not hesitate to spend heavily on technical talents and recruit them as soon as possible. In terms of machinery, they should also promote the new and eliminate the old, and should not follow the old ways and be content with the status quo, so as to prevent the progress of their own business. This is what the factory authorities should realize urgently, and it is also an important way to increase production and reduce unemployment today.</p>
<h3>China Communications and China Banks Organize Syndicate for Purchasing Wheat Loans</h3>
<p>In order to implement the unified purchase of wheat, the National Commercial Control Council has ordered the Shanfen Wheat Professional Committee to formulate a temporary plan for the unified purchase of wheat, and it has been approved by the joint meeting of directors and supervisors. The Fenmai Professional Committee will establish nine branch offices and 20 branch offices in the main wheat-producing areas of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces according to the provisions of the plan to implement the purchase of wheat. The registration procedures for wheat merchants in various places are currently being carried out, and the purchase of wheat will be implemented from next month. Regarding the issue of funds for purchasing wheat, the association has signed an agreement with the Central Reserve Bank, designating China Communications and China Banks to lend 100 million yuan to meet the needs of funds for purchasing wheat in June and July. This loan is carried out in the form of acceptance drafts. The Fenmai Professional Committee develops drafts and authorizes them to various flour mills, and entrusts them to merchants and traders to concentrate wheat merchants to purchase wheat in the producing areas. The owners of the wheat obtain the drafts of the wheat purchase funds, which can be discounted to China Communications and China Banks, and China Communications and China Banks will request rediscount from the Central Reserve Bank. As for the interest issue, it is currently being negotiated, and a concrete decision will be made soon. It is said that China Communications and China Banks have organized a wheat purchase loan syndicate and approved more than ten commercial banks such as other Mainland, Jincheng, Zhejiang Xingye, Zhejiang Shiye, Shanghai Commercial, Juye, Zhongfu, Guohua, Zhongnan, and Huaxing to participate in the wheat loan.</p>
<h3>Siming and Other Four Banks to be Reorganized Next Month, Central Reserve Bank Has Prepared to Take Over Official Shares</h3>
<p>In order to improve the financial institutions in Central China, the National Government has reorganized the Siming, China General Commerce, China Industrial, and China National Products Banks to completely eliminate the Chongqing color. The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance and the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank have been sent to jointly check the accounts of the four banks. After being approved, they will be reorganized and the main points for handling the four banks will be determined, and the first directors and supervisors will be appointed. The chairman of China National Products Bank is designated as Pu Fuxiao, the chairman of China General Commerce Bank is Zhang Wenhuan, the chairman of Siming Commercial Savings Bank is Li Sihao, and the chairman of China Industrial Bank is Zhu Chenquan. The total capital of the four banks is set at 4 million yuan each, and all the funds are fully collected. All the previous official shares will be taken over by the Central Reserve Bank and sold to merchants and civilians to make them pure commercial banks and cancel their previous issuance and exchange privileges. It is learned that the four banks have decided to implement the reorganization in accordance with the law from next month. In addition to the national products, the four banks were originally called the small three banks. In the past, they held the right of issuance and the scope was not small. The factions were different. They were all reorganized with the assistance of the previous government due to difficulties in turnover, and the state banks stipulated by the previous government were responsible for management respectively to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation. The distribution is that the Central Bank manages Siming, China manages General Commerce, and Communications manages China Industrial, and each unit is called sister banks, which is what is called the small three banks compared to the big three banks.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Market Last Week Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Due to the instigation of general rumors and the manipulation and hoarding by speculators, the financial, industrial, and commercial market conditions in Shanghai last week suddenly showed an upward trend. The situation on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday soared, and after the relevant authorities conducted a thorough investigation and suppressed it, the rise subsided, and the various market conditions turned loose immediately. Because the floating funds were invested in the countryside, the silver roots became tighter. However, due to the well-organized adjustment by the authorities and financial institutions, the financial situation remained stable as always.</p>
<h3>Various Trade Associations Dispatch Agents to Secretly Investigate Price-Gouging Businesses</h3>
<p>The various trade associations in this city have separately established "Commodity Evaluation Committees" to carry out evaluation work. They have successively negotiated and determined the standard price limits for commodities managed by their respective trades, and these have been approved and implemented by the authorities. Recently, the evaluation committees of the various trade associations, based on reports from various sources, have found that member businesses of the trade associations are not selling goods according to the price limits, but are arbitrarily exceeding the price limits in the hope of obtaining illegal profits. This not only violates the evaluation regulations of the trade association, but also runs counter to the purpose of the evaluation. They have requested that agents be secretly dispatched to investigate the truth, and that severe penalties be imposed to serve as a warning and to stabilize the business market. It is now known that the various evaluation committees, in view of this and to uphold their original intentions, are not only happy to accept sincere reports from all sectors, but have also dispatched personnel to secretly investigate the truth. If any violations of regulations are found, their brand names and addresses will be recorded and sent to the association for public discussion and punishment.</p>
<h3>Trade Association Activities</h3>
<p>Cotton Cloth Industry: After being ordered to merge the sailcloth industry, hand-woven cloth industry, wooden loom cloth industry, and waterproof rubberized cloth industry, the Cotton Cloth Trade Association, recently, the yarn, sock, and dyeing industries have also voluntarily joined. The association has already completed preparations, and yesterday (the 27th) at 2:00 PM held an inaugural meeting in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on North Suzhou Road. More than 130 member representatives attended, and senior officials from various agencies attended to supervise and guide. Thirty-one articles of association were passed on the spot, and twenty-five directors, including Pan Xusheng and Qiang Xilin, and seven supervisors, including Cui Fuzhuang and Yao Yizhang, were elected immediately.</p>
<p>Secondhand Goods Industry: Since the Shanghai Secondhand Goods Trade Association submitted its application to the competent authorities for organization, it is now actively registering members. All shops engaged in the buying and selling of secondhand goods are eligible to join. It is understood that the industry's business purpose is to utilize waste materials, which is perfectly suited to the wartime system. The association, in view of the fact that small pawnshops in the city also engage in the buying and selling of secondhand goods, has specifically formulated ten rules to strictly regulate themselves.</p>
<p>Cotton Industry Federation: The Cotton Industry Federation, in conjunction with the Commercial Control Headquarters, has appointed Tong Lüqing and twenty-four others to prepare quickly for the inaugural meeting, which is scheduled to be held at 2:00 PM on July 3rd at the Chinese Cotton Cloth Exchange. At that time, cotton, flying flower, and end flower industries within the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two special municipalities of Shanghai and Nanjing, must send representatives to attend to discuss the articles of association and elect the first board of directors and supervisors.</p>
<p>Public Life</p>
<h3>The Life of a Bookstore Clerk</h3>
<p>— Guan Long</p>
<p>I am a clerk in a very small bookstore. In the past, the store's business hours were from 8:30 AM to 9:00 PM, a full twelve and a half hours of work. Recently, due to electricity conservation and the general habits of the business community, the business hours have been shortened considerably to 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM; now that there is so much more free time in the morning and evening, the clerks and apprentices each have their own things to do; during busy times, I would take the time to read newspapers and magazines, and now I have more than enough time to satisfy my thirst for knowledge. Although the position of a clerk is humble, they are indeed direct laborers in commerce. What they get in exchange for their amiable attitude and sincere words every day is the buyer's nitpicking, trouble, and the shop owner's unreasonable condemnation. Three meals and a place to sleep are the standard rewards, and the salary is thirty yuan a month. Taking one yuan a day as a calculation, when the month falls on the high point of the back of the hand, it is less than that. Every year at the end of the year, it is traditionally a time when people expect joy to come, but the year-end bonus given by the shopkeeper to the clerk who has worked hard for a year is only about three times the normal amount. This is what I actually get personally, and it cannot be compared with the clerks in the hardware, woolen, and cigarette paper businesses, because a small number of industries, under distorted development, make huge profits, and can afford to give a tiny fraction of that to the clerks. In our store, it is customary to eat porridge in the morning and evening, and only rice or noodles for lunch. In these difficult times, we cannot talk about nutrition, only about filling our stomachs. Although the faces of our colleagues show signs of illness, no one has ever been found to have stomach problems, which is something to be thankful for. We have no fixed beds, let alone any mattresses. The glass counter or a long bench is a good bedroom in winter; in summer, the cement floor is the best place to sleep, cool and comfortable, providing a good night's sleep for the year. As for making the thirty yuan cover everything besides food and housing, that is very difficult, and it takes a lot of thought to manage it properly. To maintain a clean appearance, haircuts and grooming are necessary expenses. It is impossible to buy new clothes. Because dirt can damage clothing, we have to wash them frequently, and the depreciation rate of socks is quite high. Social expenses and donations cannot be avoided, because this is a collective action, and I cannot not participate. We regard the year-end bonus as our biggest income, but it is getting worse every year. What we earn now has increased slightly compared to previous years, but the materials we can buy have decreased. For example, we expect to be able to buy a cloth long gown with a certain amount of money, but by the time we receive the bonus, the price of cloth has gone up. We cannot afford to hoard a piece of cloth clothing, and we sympathize with the poor who cannot afford to buy and store some food when the price is low. Our educational level is obviously different. We all know some Chinese characters, because of the convenience of the job. As long as we are not too lazy or stupid, we can write and calculate after being an apprentice for three years. If we are diligent, we can also squeeze into the advertising, artist, and assistant editor fields. To seek knowledge, we should study hard and strive for a bright future.</p>

<h3>Content and Form – Miscellaneous Notes on Literary Writing</h3>
<p>— Zhao Xiang</p>
<p>What forms a work is content and form.</p>
<p>What is content? It is selecting the material for a work from the tempering of life experiences, in the fertile field of objective reality—called material because it has not yet been tailored by the author into a work of art. Some also call it matter or subject matter. Once it has been subjected to the author's molding, appropriately organized, skillfully summarized, unified, and then expressed concretely in words, it becomes the content of a work, and also becomes the theme expressing the work.</p>
<p>What is form? It is the result of the entire creative process of composing a work, it is an author's artistic expression ability, the technique of handling the entire subject matter, including language, structure, description, rhetorical techniques, and so on.</p>
<p>Which should be more important in a work, content or form? Content over form, or form over content, this has been hotly debated. Some believe that content is more important, that if the content is rich, even if the form is rough, it does not matter, because the content is like flesh and blood, and what we want to absorb is the nutrition within; while form is just an appearance, and a rough appearance will not hinder the essence of its nature. If there is only a glittering form, and the content is empty, isn't that "empty"? If the content is corrupt, then being seduced by the dazzling form is enough to be poisoned by it. But some people think that form should be more important than content. Their reasoning is: artistic works must be reflected through the author's subjective fusion, using concrete images, and if the author does not have refined skills and rich language, it is very likely that they will not be able to extract the essence of reality, and clearly highlight the theme. Due to this clumsy skill and poor language, even if there is rich life experience that is originally positive content, it will be obscure and dim, with trivial waste mixed in, just like three points of gold are wrapped in a basket of sand. Isn't this wasting the subject matter? On the contrary, with refined skills, even ordinary subject matter can be rendered brilliantly by the author, so form is more important than content.</p>
<p>The above two arguments cannot be said to have no considerable reason, but I feel that they both inevitably commit the mistake of seeing only the other side and forgetting themselves, and are both one-sided. Simply emphasizing content while ignoring form is always somewhat lacking. Simply focusing on form while fundamentally ignoring content has a "art for art's sake" flavor. I feel that there should be absolutely no exclusivity or separation between content and form, they should be organically linked and unified.</p>
<p>Due to the establishment of this principle, the becoming of an artistic work as immortal and great lies not only in the author's subjective role in the correctness of their understanding of reality, and the positivity of the work's theme concretely expressing the objective and real, but also in the completeness and beauty of the form created by the result of the entire creative process, the intensity of artistic expression ability, and the reader's receptivity and educational effect, which is the artistic value of the work. Works with the same rural theme can be superior or inferior due to the strength of artistic expression ability. This can be illustrated with a parable: a piece of exquisite jade, a skilled sculptor can carve into a great work of art, but in the hands of a rough stonemason, it will at most be made into an ordinary toy. Furthermore, if the author does not have personal experience, on-the-spot investigation, deep understanding, far-sighted and sharp vision, and rich imagination, and if life is confined to a narrow circle, even if their writing skills have reached the level of proficiency, the narrowness and unfamiliarity of the subject matter will ultimately prevent them from writing great works, just like picking up a piece of rotten wood and vainly hoping to make it into a treasure for the ages, it will ultimately be beyond their ability.</p>
<p>The relationship between the content and opening of a work is so close. But in fact, it is often difficult to have both due to objective environmental limitations and self-ability. It is often the case that the content is rich but the form is rough, or the form is complete but the content is bland. This phenomenon is particularly evident in the works of young beginners, which is natural, and even many experienced writers cannot easily adjust and unify content and form without difficulty. In the process of Gorky, I don't know how many twists and turns he encountered, the difficulty in collecting subject matter, the unsatisfactoriness of techniques, the incompleteness of rhetoric, and often worried and thought hard about this, correcting and redoing, and it was not until more than ten years later that the manuscript was completed, and the various drafts were calculated to be stacked up to five or six hundred pages. From this, it can be seen that great works are certainly vivid and exciting in content, and overflow with a sense of the times, but the completeness and sophistication of the form are also indispensable for adding to the brilliance of the work itself.</p>
<h3>My Teacher</h3>
<p>— Pei Ji</p>
<p>It was about two years ago! One late autumn afternoon, the north wind was blowing fiercely, and the sky was drizzling. I quickly ate lunch, grabbed my schoolbag, and picked up an umbrella, and slipped out the door, because class started at school at 1:30 PM.</p>
<p>It was about half an hour's walk from home to school. Looking at my watch, it was almost one o'clock. I was anxious, and the sharp wind relentlessly blew my umbrella back and forth to the left. The lower half of my pants was wet with rain, and there was no direct tram to take. In desperation, I had to resort to a rickshaw. With difficulty, I hired one for two yuan, and told him to pull it to the end of Vegetable Market Road.</p>
<p>Once in the car, the rickshaw driver pulled up the fender, leaving only the top where my head could look out. The rain could not hit me, and the speed increased a lot. I shivered, feeling very comfortable. The rickshaw driver did not say a word, lifted the rickshaw handles, and unhesitatingly lifted his legs and ran forward. Raindrops hit the hood, splashing out a monotonous, rustling sound. I leaned back in the car, listening to the rickshaw wheels making a gurgling, fierce splashing sound. Even though the rickshaw driver was running very fast, the sky was still dark and gloomy, and the asphalt road was washed as clear as a mirror. Looking around on the street, everything—the shop signs, roofs, cars, telephone wires, trams, sidewalks, umbrellas, etc.—was shiny with water, wet and dripping.</p>
<p>"Rickshaw!" This rough cry echoed from every alley entrance and every street corner, tugging at the heartstrings.</p>
<p>In a flash, the rickshaw arrived at the West Gate intersection. On a corner, my gaze suddenly caught a blurry figure in front of me. My heart began to beat uncontrollably. Looking closely, wasn't it our English teacher, Mr. Yao? He was teaching the first class in the afternoon. He was wearing a worn, greasy dark blue Chinese-style suit, oversized rubber galoshes on his feet, holding a cloth umbrella in his right hand, and several books tucked under his left arm. He was walking, striding forward, not turning his head. When the wind blew hard, he stumbled and straightened the tilted umbrella. The pant legs, wet with raindrops, clung tightly to his heavy legs.</p>
<p>He was hurrying in front of me, constantly swinging those huge rubber galoshes; the distance between us gradually shortened. My heart beat faster, and I felt uncomfortable, not knowing what to do. A pang of sorrow inexplicably rose in my chest. I lowered my head, afraid of being seen by him.</p>
<p>"Why doesn't he hire a rickshaw in this exhausting weather? Doesn't he have a severe stomach ailment? Strenuous walking after a meal is harmful to him. Why doesn't he have a rickshaw?" I thought to myself uneasily.</p>
<p>"Woo woo! Woo woo!" A streamlined private car suddenly came from behind. My rickshaw driver did not have time to avoid it, and it had already passed me like a shuttle at a frightening speed. Since the road was covered with some water, the car tires immediately rolled up white, misty waves that splashed onto the side of my rickshaw.</p>
<p>"Damn it!" Muddy waves soaked the rickshaw driver's waist. He slowed his pace and cursed fiercely.</p>
<p>Ah! The car's waves splashed onto the pant legs of my English teacher. He was startled and tried to turn away, but his feet were already covered in sewage. He looked at his feet, stumbled, and hurried on without saying a word. The car drove far away. Everywhere, a large swath of white water was splashed. I was angry, gritting my teeth and hating everything. I wanted to offer Mr. Yao a seat but I couldn't, so I lowered my head, closed my eyes, and didn't want to look again.</p>
<p>My rickshaw gradually passed Mr. Yao, but he still seemed to be hurrying along without delay. Hurrying along...</p>
<p>The school had arrived, and it was raining even harder. I paid the fare and looked back, only to see a vast expanse, unable to see even half of Mr. Yao's shadow. He was lagging behind. He was still hurrying in the distance. Entering the classroom, it was already 1:25 PM. Most of the students had arrived. A general dampness mixed with human odors was unpleasant. The room was noisy and chaotic. Some were loudly reciting English texts, and some were chatting.</p>
<p>"Mr. Yao is going to be late again!"</p>
<p>"His stomach pain is probably acting up again!"</p>
<p>"I haven't prepared today's homework. It would be best if he didn't come."</p>
<p>I was stunned, and the scene of Mr. Yao struggling with the wind and rain on the road swirled in my mind; Mr. Yao had indeed changed recently from what he had been like before. This was all due to the influence of the current life. Although he was not yet forty years old, he looked as old as someone in his fifties. In the past, he only taught at one middle school and lived a decent life. Now he had to teach at three day schools and one night school, but he still couldn't make ends meet every month. His teaching hours exceeded forty per week, from morning to evening, with no rest. He was mentally exhausted. Mrs. Yao still had to wash the rice and vegetables, doing everything herself. In the past, Mr. Yao always stood on the podium when he taught, never sitting down. He always arrived early and left late, and his voice was loud and clear, but now it was different. Everything was the opposite of what it had been before. He also had a very serious stomach ailment. When life was difficult, it often recurred and caused trouble. Under these circumstances, it was too difficult for him.</p>
<p>The bell rang five minutes past the hour, but Mr. Yao had not yet come in. Everyone was getting impatient waiting. A few students began to leave the classroom.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a heavy footstep sound came from outside. Everyone was sure that it was Mr. Yao who had arrived. The room immediately became silent. The person who hurried in was indeed Mr. Yao, whom I had seen on the road. He placed his soaked umbrella in the corner, closed the door, his whole body drenched like a drowned rat, his face pale, and his breathing rapid, as if he were a runner who had reached the end of a long-distance race. The classroom was silent for about three minutes. No one spoke. Mr. Yao looked at everyone on the podium, as if he wanted to say something, but then he picked up the textbook.</p>
<p>"Today we will be discussing the article 'What Career'." He seemed very tired.</p>
<p>"Before we start reading this article... I... have a few words... to say to you:" he said in a trembling voice, but he seemed very determined. "This article will teach you to choose... a career that suits your interests in the future, but... don't be fooled by it. The rewards of work are more important than interests. The power of money is the greatest..." "I advise you... you can do anything in the future, but you must not become a teacher... I tighten my belt and come to class hungry, but no one sympathizes with me. There is loud crying at home, but no one pays attention..." he said very sincerely, his voice loud.</p>
<p>"...You see, isn't it funny? I am a teacher, but I can't afford to educate my son..."</p>
<p>"Now this is..." he started today's lesson.</p>
<p>I looked at my watch, there were only ten minutes left before class ended.</p>
<h3>The Exiled Crowd in the City</h3>
<p>— Song Lian</p>
<p>From Guangdong, from Hubei, from Beiping, from Nanjing, groups of people suffering the same fate were connected by poisonous traffic lines, and were irresistibly thrown into the black chimneys of the city!</p>
<p>Rushing, rushing, being rushed all the way, the red sun set, and the white sun rose again. Green mountains and clear waters, yellow tiles, white millet, everything was left behind. Grass, trees, flowers, and butterflies seemed to be just some embellishments on the vast road, just to look at and play with.</p>
<p>Arrived, this is a small station on the journey of life, we emerged from the snake's belly, looking at some eyes spitting out the expectations of welcoming relatives, our hearts were healed, simply crushed into powder, and thought turned into fine sand, pouring into this powder, like freezing cement, we forgot everything, standing there numbly!</p>
<p>The train had already left, returning to that terrible cave! We turned our eyes back, glaring at this black python——</p>
<p>——Pah, blood-sucking thing, cold-blooded insect that abandoned us!</p>
<p>The surroundings became dead silent. So dragging our bell-heavy bodies out of the platform, aimlessly; only the hesitant sound of shoes, composing some mournful natural rhymes, in this unfamiliar air.</p>
<p>In China, wanderers do not have the great torsos, round arms, beards, and enormous bodies of Russians, they can only wander aimlessly in the streets, begging for some food at the back doors of some wealthy families, not even enough to feed their children! If you want to seek another development, the domineering voice of "which way are you eating?" will seem to swallow your whole body——of course, including the things you begged for——he'll come over and look at you in a very knowing way, pinching his fingers together to make a rattling sound.</p>
<p>Looking for work! Who wants you? Even if you have the cheap labor of an ox, isn't the machine better than you? Hee! It's really the base person! People are cheap and things are expensive, but people don't eat human flesh, no matter how many times cheaper than pork you are.</p>
<p>Go to the refugee camp! Every day spinning around in some bottomless alleys, is not going to work, some children are still making such a fuss.</p>
<p>Signing up, almost as if you are being introduced. Enduring, interrogated like a prisoner, you passed a difficult hurdle. Living here will be stable now! No! There's more to it than that... familiar faces seem to be fewer, but what does it matter, it's better to be fed than to starve to death.</p>
<p>Vicious friends, hanging long "benefactor" faces, prowling in and out, monitoring everything. You can rest assured, we don't have a home, but you don't have any valuables either, but what can you do to the benefactor, the benefactor with the benefactor's face?</p>
<p>"Beat him, Mom! Aren't you still relying on us to live, the good fortune living now, should also have a limit." When this guy was beaten, we dragged him out, each spitting out a mouthful of air, the fire of anger was burning! Burn this guy to death! Burn down this broken house! Destroy everything, even ourselves!</p>
<p>But, like letting out a breath, a person's anger is limited, someone is persuading us, and it's over, this guy wasn't beaten to death. But we suffered a loss.</p>
<p>We were rushed out of a life that needed to be stable. Our traces can be found by walls and in corners of houses. We also have the flesh and blood of the rich, although this natural cruelty is less considerate than that above.</p>
<p>Let's go to the refugee camp again, children whose parents have died, parents whose children have died, refugees are becoming more and more numerous every day, exiles, what kind of evil fate do you ultimately have, everyone who can sympathize with you on the exile's line of life, but cannot produce the strength to help!</p>
<p>The more people there are, the more chaotic it becomes, your father is matched with my child, my husband is matched with your wife, we'll take care of it when we have time, we can't take care of all this now, hey! Isn't there talk outside about catching exiles. Those without occupations, tied up in strings, are they sheep? Are they cattle? Who doesn't recognize them! Anyway, they are useless things, lowly things, things that have no hope of rising in price, things that cannot be stockpiled, that's all!</p>
<p>The talk is getting tighter, really like pulling out the sea, or laboring like breaking bones of bamboo, in strings, in strings, in strings...</p>
<p>Dispersing wealth, it's very much like dispersing what cannot be dispersed! So let it be dispersed!</p>
<p>Every day, every day, Hu Ning Road is crowded with people, crying faces, more bitter than when they came!</p>
<p>We were also sent to the station, holding two very light bills. Look at our clothes, look at our surroundings, the clothes are worn more tattered, and there are fewer familiar faces around; have they died? Or are they in another corner of the earth? No one can say, no one can say!</p>
<p>The black python has come again! This time in the sun, it's even more vicious! But it's also old!</p>
<p>However, its "old" is not a hindrance, after hundreds of years, when it dies, its corpse can still be resurrected under human control, but what about our relatives.</p>
<p>We are caught in its belly again, like being forcibly thrown into the arms of a lover without love. With a "du" sound, we are off again.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I don't know about the day after tomorrow, next year, I don't know about the year after next, I will die, being killed by a lover, I can't say that my death is unjust, because isn't it still taking me away?</p>
<p>We arrived at the station again, still crawling out from its belly, still the eyes that are excited to see the excitement, still the eyes with the passionate hope of welcoming relatives, our hearts are scarred, but again and again, this is always becoming very light.</p>
<h3>Progress in the Dark</h3>
<p>— Hu Mingyang</p>
<p>Ah!</p>
<p>Why is it so dark all around, we can't see anything even with all our might.</p>
<p>What!</p>
<p>This road is so rugged,</p>
<p>We grope forward,</p>
<p>Also unavoidable the danger of tumbling.</p>
<p>Listen!</p>
<p>The sea tide is surging.</p>
<p>Isn't that the sea ahead?</p>
<p>Listen!</p>
<p>The wild beasts are roaring.</p>
<p>Isn't that the wilderness ahead?</p>
<p>Listen!</p>
<p>And also the hooting of the owl,</p>
<p>The laughter of the devil.</p>
<p>All of this makes us shudder,</p>
<p>Makes us hesitate on the path forward.</p>
<p>But, dear ones, don't be afraid!</p>
<p>Strive forward, pass through this rugged road,</p>
<p>Over there is the world we yearn for, as beautiful as a fantasy, enough to make us forget the bitterness.</p>
