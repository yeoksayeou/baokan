<h3 id="c1">再談提高戰時生產 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>昨論「穩定市塲與增加生產」，略陳穩定幣値與提高生產爲增進限價效能，解決物價問題，實現戰時經濟政策綱領的兩大主要因素。如果不從這兩點着眼而積極努力，則一切經濟政策都不免落空，至多也只能做到「事倍功半」；尤其是提高生產更爲當前及今後要策，我們認爲還有進一步就具體方法上加以商榷的必要。</p>
<p>第一，必須調整國營企業，日本在華經營的與中日官方合營的企業，必須改善其機構，提高其效率，使完全適合於戰時與戰後的實際需要，而實現大東亞經濟共榮的理想。特別是我國國營企業，以及今後接收管理的敵產，應該充分利用其生產設備，及原有人力。凡是專門的技術人材，應保障其職務，俾盡其所長；凡是閒員，即應另調他職，要知在目前情形下，如果虛設幾個工廠，實際上只是安插幾個人員，對於提高生產是沒有補益的。</p>
<p>第二，對於私人企業，不問為國人經營的，抑為友邦人士的，都應做到一律平等待遇。而政府對於國人私營企業，就應盡量資助，目前國營及日營企業的生產品，在供應量所佔的百分比，還遠不及私人企業生產量之多。在私人企業中，現代工業所生產的日用品，尤有重要的價值。如果充分發展我國中小生產事業，則在食糧上的碾米業，在衣料上的花紗棉布，在日用品上的火柴肥皂等等，其生產數量，將來決非國營事業生產力所能趕及。為了發展生產，必須看清這個局勢，必須取消一切人為的障礙，特別是在準備及實施全面管制物資的今天，更須顧全及扶助民間中小生產，那些妨礙生產，阻滯運輸，甚至助長囤積的現象，應迅速加以清算。</p>
<p>第三，在今後的稅制上，對工礦與商業應有區別，應該征收南業稅而優待生產。如實行產業的過分利得稅，所得稅，即應以個人所得及利得為對象，而不以產業組織為對象。間接稅之增加，也應謹慎，假如關卡林立，重複征稅，只在加重貨運之負担，對於平抑物價是極端有妨害的。</p>
<p>第四，國家的金融機關，必須切實負責供應工礦業的短期流動資金，加强辦理貼現，抵押放款，代辦發行公司債，優先股，保息股等業務，必要時政府可以貸放長期款項。同時，對於商業放款之限制，對於遊資之利用，也要進一步作有效的處置，在金融上造成提高生產的有利條件。</p>
<p>第五，有關當局，必須扶助工礦生產業，解決某些技術人材及原料器材缺乏的問題，以誘導掖輔的態度，鼓勵公私企業，製造那些缺乏而急需的物資。在現有的技術條件物質條件之下，我們深信和平區的生產之發展，具有遠大的前途的。只要政府在誘導扶助上多出一點力，那末生產事業必可飛躍發展的。</p>
<p>此外，我們不能忽視的，一方面要改善工人的工作條件，同時加强工作强度，加多輪班次數，實行全天生產，（即廢除晝夜之分），這是沂代科學發達各國提高生產的主要辦法。另一方面，我們針對中國經濟結構與社會組織的特點，更應努力獎勵手工業，農村副產業及家庭工業，發展市鎭鄕村的生產，也是增進戰時軍需民用物資的重要辦法。而這兩方面的措施，同時還可以改善工人，農民及一般平民的生活，在政治上社會上也有極重大的意義。</p>
<p>提高戰時生產效率，同時也就是鞏固戰後新中國建設的基礎。我們昨今兩天所提的主要原則與具體辦法，決不是輕率立言，而是就我國國勢與民情，爲中國獨立與東共榮而縝密硏究的結論，希望有關方面注意參考，或進而硏究實施，那麼眞是中國之幸，東亞之福。</p>

<h3 id="c2">倫敦的活劇 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>英美接連上演的活劇，層出不窮。在最近的壓台戲加薩勃朗加會談中，英美關於北菲問題的糾葛，美國用舊驅遂艦五十艘，藉租借九十九年的形式而奪取了英國在西半球的十餘處根據地，如再供給五十艘，則便完全成爲美國的領土，美國方面的議論，大爲起勁。此次蘇聯與波蘭之間的糾紛，亦煩英美搬上舞台串演，全世界觀衆欣賞了現時最罕見的活劇。</p>
<p>在此次世界大戰的序幕中，僅一個月後即吿覆滅的波蘭亡命政府，從倫敦向蘇聯要求收復失地，蘇聯加以拒絕。英美以爲蘇聯的行爲簡直在向大西洋憲章挑戰，而一幕幽靈劇遂告閉幕，但同樣亡命於倫敦的捷克政府首領貝納許等，則同情蘇聯，對抗波蘭，所以該幕戲劇的說明書極爲複雜。</p>
<p>蘇聯向大西洋憲章的那一部分挑戰呢？當指第二項中，修正領土的塲合，當地居民的自由意志，應加以最大的注意，與第三項中，應尊重各國人民及居民的主權與自治二點而言。那麼，蘇聯不是不願意被英美的維持現狀的憲章之類所束縛嗎？在英美看來，假使承認蘇聯的行爲，則將失却諸幽靈政府的信望，那麽，如其蘇聯堅持現在的態度，英美又將怎樣對付呢，這是本劇與味的中心點。</p>
<p>幽靈政府把蘇聯當作對手，這在蘇聯看來是一件奇事，實際上，波蘭和捷克的獨立，已經滅亡，不是一個常熊的國家，在幽靈界而欲與現世保持連絡，且欲繼續活動，豈不是一件不可思議的事。在現世已經不睦的兩個國家，成爲幽靈之後，依然互相咆哮，豈非又是一件不可思議的事？英美把這樣兩個幽靈緊抱懷中，作爲同盟國，更是件不可思議的奇事。（翔：譯自三月六日西部每日新聞）</p>

<p>定皇國興基之奉天會戰，距今凡卅八年，三月十日，欣逢此光榮不朽之陸軍紀念日，時值決戰時期，兆億國民，倍感與奮。當初日本鑒於俄羅斯調兵遣將增强遠東之軍備，在此種武力壓迫之下，如稍鬆懈，即有被迫於絕境之危，可謂肇　以來之空前國難。</p>
<p>彼時俄國陸軍，擊破席捲歐洲天地之拿破崙大軍後，誇稱當世無敵之强盛，在兵力上超過吾人十餘倍，擁有優良銳利之武器。雖得天運神助之日本，亦非尋常可操勝利，實爲堪慮之强敵。</p>
<p>當二月四日召開閣議決定日俄開戰之際，桂　相曾經發表文吿，喚起國民之決心，略謂：「吾人雖無必勝之把握，但亦必憑傳統之精神，決一死戰，」在舉國一致，前仆後繼之勇戰下，終於超出世界之預料，使强俄屈服，克服空前　難。今日日本所遭遇之嚴重事態，究無日俄戰爭當時之嚴重。開戰以還，銳不可擋之皇軍，屢獲煊赫戰續，雄戚冠蓋世界，北自雪滿山河之阿留地安羣島，南至瘴癘爲患之南太平洋各島，舉凡要衝悉在掌握，已奠堅固不拔之戰略形勢。但敵方猶在積極反攻。</p>
<p>羅斯福曾經誇稱：「爲使日本最後失敗起見，將逐一攻擊分散於太平洋上之各島，費時耗力在所不計。」故未可貿斷美國之對日反攻爲紙上談兵，或爲搗亂佔領區之丑劇。事實上，美國刻正注力於擴充軍需生產，同時具體加强援渝，增加在渝空軍，强化澳洲防務與南太平洋各島之根據地，步步準備對日反攻，其圖逞之野心，誠未可輕視。</p>
<p>未來之美國反攻，必爲有計劃與有組織之反攻，此即日美最後決戰之階段。衆認此最大決戰，已迫眉睫，日軍業已鞏固共榮圈之外圍屛障，兵力充足，隨時隨地均有擊滅敵方反攻之力量。</p>
<p>另一方面，日本駐華派遣軍，佔頓中國全土十分之四，北自蒙疆鄂爾多斯，南至粤省海南島方面，近又爲預防渝軍之蠢動，進駐雷州半島之法國租借地廣州灣，戰綫擴展至七千公里，將最高壓力不斷加諸重慶。國府參戰後，調派三十萬精軍分佈於中國戰線，成固若金湯之形勢，使渝美合作反攻之企圖，無隙可乘，駐華日軍之戰力，愈見充實，士氣，旺盛，隨時隨地可予重慶各戰區實施積極攻勢。</p>
<p>日軍在大陸之勝勢，固不待論，即共榮國各地，亦均確立絕對不敗之戰略形勢，確信最後勝利必麗吾人。但世界戰局，愈趨嚴重，在此一年，亦可謂目前，每日之激戰，均為決定成敗之戰爭，亦為決定　國興亡之嚴重階段，故今日之決戰，吾兆億國民必須發揮總力，抱定捨私奉公，共赴國難之決心，吾人須將擊破强敵俄軍之光輝傳統，重　於今日之戰爭，値此決戰時期，欣逢此偉大之陸軍紀念節日，其意義殊爲深長也。（雲鵬：譯自三月十日大陸新報）</p>

<h3 id="c23">鋼鐵工業　日本重要概況（四） <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>隨着中國事變的進展，美國對日本取毬種壓迫手段，其中之一便是在昭和十五年十二月全面的禁止銑鐵及鋼材輸出至日本，當時日本的鋼鐵界，在屑鐵，鋼材等方面依存於海外的供給者很多，所以美國之威嚇性的禁止輸出，不容否定對於日本有相當的打擊。然而反過來說，日本的鋼鐵業，却因此而脫却了向來的海外依存性，給與日本進向鋼鐵自給的一個轉機。在這種鋼鐵情况的背景，於是遂因昭和十六年四月重要產業團體令的頒佈而誕生了鋼鐵統制會。該統制會鑒於其設立的經過，爲謀大東亞共榮圈自主的鋼鐵業之確立，故揭　計劃鋼鐵業之綜合的運營爲第一目的，以期完成國防國家體制。其後，因重要產業團體令的施行，而加以改組，推進鋼鐵自給的大目標，同時，爲應付大東亞戰爭勃發前後情勢的變遷，常立於鋼鐵業界的指導地位。</p>
<p>就鋼鐵統制會的會員來看，日本鋼鐵界的現勢，總數共有四十九社，其內容計生產會社三十八，原料及販賣會社四，滿洲國方面參加者有七社。生產會社中從事一貫的鋼鐵作業者爲日鐵，日本鋼管，中山製鋼，小倉製鋼，尼崎製鐵五家。他如神戶製鋼，川崎重工，尼崎製鋼，住友金屬工業，吾嬬製鋼，口亞製鋼，大同製鋼，三菱製鋼，日本特殊鋼管，壽重工業等，這幾家沒有從鑛石製成銑鐵的高爐設備，祇用平爐生產鋼材及特殊鋼。鋼鐵生產會社中，日鐵，日本鋼管所占的地位極爲重要，可以算是日本的二大代表會社，尤其是日鐵，具有半國策會社性，設備，規模，均極偉大，占日本的鋼鐵製產量半數以上。日本鋼管採托瑪斯製鋼法，爲日本唯一的製鐵會社，這方法用以處理低品質的鑛石，極爲有利，故日鐵於去年十二月亦加採用。</p>
<p>原料及販賣關係會社之中的鋼鐵原料統制會社及鋼鐵販賣統制會社，完全由鋼鐵統制會出資，統制會職員兼任社長，是純粹的內含機關。即先由鋼鐵統制會一元的收買銑鐵，半製品，鐵鑛石，鐵屑及製鐵用煤等之後，經鋼鐵原料統制會社，視各鋼鐵業者的生產比率而加以適當的配給。各鋼鐵業者所生產的東西，由鋼鐵販賣統制會一元的收買，依照鋼鐵統制會的指示，經由各零售商而銷售於消費者。因此，鋼鐵業從生產到配給消費，都在一貫的計劃下實施。</p>
<p>滿洲國方面參加的生產會社有昭和製鋼，木溪湖煤鐵公司，鞍山鋼材，滿洲羅爾，滿洲住友金屬工業，日滿鋼管六家，其中經營銑鋼一貫作業者爲昭和製鋼，設立於昭和四年，爲最初從事在滿洲經營的會社，現在加入滿洲重工業會社，其製鐵設備及生產量，僅次於日鐵，每年輸出的銑鐵及鋼材很多，日本深資倚賴，十七年度，預計可以向日本輸出的銑鐵數量，業已輸送終了，至於鋼材，預計的數量聞亦已確實輸出。</p>
<p>去年十二月，華北新設的華北製鐵會社，業已舉行創立總會，該社的工塲尙在建設中，該社開始工作之際，即爲向確立日華滿鐵自給自足體制的大目標更踏進了一步。對於昭和製鋼，華北製鐵二會社的期望，今後愈趨重視。</p>
<p>因戰爭的進展，鋼鐵生產顯然　有緊急性的狀態。假使作戰範圍擴大，則製造兵器資材的鐵的需要自然增加。在他方面，假使作戰的海面擴大，則因運輸及種種關係，鐵的生產，發生了許多的困難。目前製鐵當事者的使命，端在如何克服這矛盾而確保生產。去年十二月，鋼鐵統制會在評議員會中，特別提出國內鐵鑛石的非常增產，提高鑛石品質，鐵屑的收回及利用，利用國內粉鑛石，原料石炭之地域的自給自足，克服劣煤品質的低下，原料及製品之陸上聯述及運輸能率的增進，從速設置小型熔鑛爐於鐵鑛資源地帶，促進滿洲鋼鐵輸入量的增加等種種對策，以期達到去年下半期預計的生產量。</p>
<p>但是國內鑛石的自給强化之後的結果，因鑛石品質的低下，恐將减少鋼鐵的生產，爲彌補此缺憾，乃增加屑鐵的配合率。因此，屑鐵的盡量收回，遂成必要。關於金屬的收回，在去年六月，設立了金屬收回統制會社，吸收日本鐵屑統制會社，舊鋼統制會社，及戰時物資活用協會，合併成爲一元的實行機關，從工塲，事業塲及一般家庭收回舊金屬，今年起，更爲了徹底整備平時產業，故切望民問自動的獻呈廢金屬碎屑。在本屆議會中，政府又鄭重聲稱將組織新的收回機構。至於運輸問題，考慮建設高爐及小型熔鑛爐等製鐵設備於鐵源地，尤以小型熔鑛爐，建設資材旣簡便，又毋須很多的時間，所以成爲當面的問題，業已由日鐵，日本鋼管，壽重工業各社計劃中，建設地域，除本國外，更將遍及於滿洲，華北，台灣等地。</p>
<p>爲這緊迫的鋼鐵生產的情勢，對於鋼鐵的統制，也因一月二十七日的工塲事業塲管理令的實施及鋼鐵統制令的改訂而有顯著的進展。政府對全國的主要製鐵工塲實行管理，其目的在克服鋼鐵生產上的許多惡劣條件，謀確保所需要的生產數量，工塲管理的意義，特別注重次述的三點：</p>
<p>（一）經國家管理之後，一般亦將深切認識指定工塲的重要性，而與之協力。</p>
<p>（二）管理工塲，使勞働的徵用成爲可能，同時，原來的勞働管理，亦可更爲澈底，解決了製鐵上的勞働問題。</p>
<p>（三）爲使計劃生產的徹底，依照物資動員計劃而實施具體的生產計劃過程上，必須要求製品的格式，大小符合需要，政府對工塲加以管理之後，在種類及時間上，政府的需要與生產可以完全一致。</p>
<p>製鐵工塲的管理實施之後，商工省派遣監督官於管理工塲，監督官與原由統制會派遣的駐在員之間的關係，駐在員從屬於監督官的指揮之下，與監督官協力指導，二者成爲一體，以進行生產計劃。去年十二月，鋼鐵絲制會的首任會長平生釗三郞及理事長小日山直登二氏辭職，選任日鐵社長豐田貞次郞氏爲繼任會長，華北製鐵社長渡邊義介氏爲繼任理事長，豐田會長以日鐵社長現職兼任，打破了統制會長專任的原職。鋼鐵統制會成立於重要產業團體會的實施之前，當時適爲近向日華滿的鋼鐵自給之轉變時期，爲完成這大目標，鋼鐵統制會必須在鋼鐵工業界上占有强力的指導地位，目前日本的鋼鐵情勢，現在的一噸鐵，較將來的十噸鐵更値得重視，因而當統制之衝者，必須洞察統制的實情，而漸次實施必要的對策。此即爲鋼鐵統制會會長由日鐵社長兼任制實現的理由。</p>
<p>覽田會長就任之初，關於統制會的營運方針，把原來的企劃尊重主義，轉變到生產計劉實踐第一主義，把企劃部併入生產部，謀生產與計劃的統一，同時，今後統制會機能的發　，將集中其重心於此大生產部，傾其全力於實踐的方面，（完）（翔：譯自三月四日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<p>旅德頗久</p>
<p>日本大使館眞鍋書記官、於西暦一九三三年至一九三六年間德元首希特勒氏執政時、在德荔浦大學任日語敎授、對德國情况頗有硏究、經濟情形更為瞭解透切、眞鍋氏曾譯德元首希特勒氏著作「我的奮鬥」備受日本國內朝野所欽仰、昨日眞鍋氏對於德國戰時力量強盛之原因、闡明頗詳、略謂、德對戰時經濟、已於此次歐戰前、早有準備、自一九三九年五月發生迄今、每載皆捷、無攻不克、戰前於一九三三年、從事於農業生產、翌年即統制糧食、不再仰求國外供給、而能自供自給、一九三五年乃實施物價統制、一九三六年開始配給制度、至一九三八年對外貿易輸出物、即達最高程度、於是第二次歐洲大戰乃於一九三九年爆發、</p>
<p>德國經濟</p>
<p>當歐戰　始前、英國對德國之觀測全　錯誤、竟以對德之經濟封鎖、而　可制德之崩潰、　在歐戰初起、假設公司之組織企圖、在歐洲東南方面收賣糧食及各種原料等物資、以為控制德國經濟之策略、然實際上毫無效果、德之攻佔波蘭·挪威·荷蘭·比利時·法國·希臘等土地、已足能運用各項龐大豐富之物資、煤蘊藏豐富、且有寗利其亞之產量、鐵鑛問題、戰後初有　倫斯波蘭之鐵鑛、繼而烏克蘭、瑞典等鐵鑛均吿鹵獲、並佔領波蘭·比利時·盧森堡法蘭西等之完　之鍊鐵工廠、以是德國鐵鋼產量、已與美國不分上下、鋁錳本身產量頗多、銅亦足自給、並在健壯挪威及南斯拉夫已得確保供給、關於亞鉛、德亦蘊藏豐富、德國煤油問題、在羅馬尼亞每年可產　七百萬噸、茄利西亞年產一百萬噸、德本身可年產五十萬噸、並有意法·愛沙尼亞三國、以　學方法、在煤石煉取之油礦尤多、</p>
<p>總動員令</p>
<p>德國今公布國民總動員令、　極生產軍事物資、普通工廠限令停止、俾集中總力此項簽定、男子自十六歲至六十五歲、婦女自十七歲至四十五歲、均令動員、餘如不重要商店及飲食銷等、限令停止、職工轉入軍事工廠服務、最後眞鍋書記官並言、如柏林之地下鐵道　車公共汽車等公用事業、從業員、經總動員令實施後、已都復員、兵役及入軍工廠工作、由女子庖代服務、此項辦法、在英美早已施行、惟在德國方於此次總動員起始、並有佔領區之工人七百萬赴德、代德人工作、故德國人力之資源亦無恐慌、人民破壞戰事物資統制、均受嚴　之處罰云、</p>

<h3 id="c47">澈底改善　公務員的生活 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— 張永定</p>
<p>廉潔政治四個字，自從民國以來，很多謀國憂時的智識之士提議過，但是到了現在，還不能做到弊絕風淸，還不能達到完全廉明的目的。這是什麼緣故呢？經我硏究起來，終不外是下列二個主要因素：</p>
<p>（一）是國家定了法，而沒有澈底的執行。</p>
<p>（二）是一般國民的生活習慣沒有合理的調整和改善。</p>
<p>關於第一點，我以為在承平的時候，當然是易於施行；而且是毫無問題的，不過在目前戰事狀態的非常時期中，還有加以考慮的地方。因為待遇低微，生活高漲，一般公務員中，即有甘冒不韙、也是出於生活迫使的，實在要佔其一半。正如最近報載，本市滬西警察局局長潘達，勗勉警察要廉潔自重，有如下的一段話：「近來本人聽到警察中，有在暗中叫苦的，說我們做警察的，每月拿九十三元的俸給，獨身的，勉強可以過去，有家眷的，很難維持生活。」不差，拿九十三元一月警餉的警士，平心而論，實在是沒法叫他養廉的。無怪杭州某機關公務員孫某，因不堪生活壓迫，竟縣樑自殺了。（詳見本月六日新申報夜報）管子說得好：「衣食足，而後知榮辱；倉麋實，而後知禮節。」話雖這樣說，不過現在政府正値參戰時期內，凡為公務員者，大家應該共體時艱，用刻苦耐勞的精神，來度過這個難關。</p>
<p>不過我以為自殺是最愚笨，最懦弱的人所幹的下策，我今以十二萬分的誠意，來敬懇大家，這種觀念，是萬萬不應該有的。我們要知道，天無絕人之路，每一個人，衹要具有淸醒的頭腦，強健的體格，是不會餓死的。曾文正說：「處此亂世，雖大富大貴，亦靠不住，惟勤儉二字，可以持久。身體雖弱，若能風霜磨練，自足堅筋骨，而長見識。」所以我們要抱定環境愈惡劣，生活愈艱難，愈應該來與這個惡劣的環境奮鬥，這樣方始不愧為做一個人的道理。現在請大家要記牢下面二句樂觀式的山歌，就是「日難過，日難過，日難過，日日過，人難做，人難做，人愈難做，愈應做。」</p>
<p>本月三日申報的社評裏，有一篇關於改善公務員生活的文章，眞可以稱之是一服切合實情謀國救時的良劑。大意是說：「全體公務員的俸給，都是不足以維持其最低限度的生活。上焉者，只足以糊口，欲言贍家，已感困難。中而下之，即本身之生活，亦不能維持，更談不到贍養家屬，敎育子女，物質之生活已苦，精神之安慰全無，雖賢如顏回，恐亦不能不改其樂。於是大都抱五日京兆之心，不復專心於政務。希望政府立即改善其待遇，重定各級公務員俸給與津貼數額，以各地物價指數為標準，至少限度務使都能贍養家屬，敎育子女，同時在精神上，提高其自尊心，使感覺國家託付之重，人人奮勉，專心奉公。」又說：「只要廉潔奉公，便應特別獎勵，公開宣揚，作為模範公務員。同時在物質上，保障其足夠的生活，這是我們主張改善和保障公務員生活的原則。」筆者以為我們政府，倘能採納上述的辦法，在國家財力可能範圍以內，統盤籌劃的來逐步加以改善，我相信，不久的將來，我們的國內，一定可以做到弊絕風淸，朝氣蓬勃的現象。所以我們要澈底推行廉潔政治，一方面固然要治之以法，一方面還是要衡之以情，使其待遇提高，生活安定，知所報效。</p>
<p>講到第二點，是容易推行，因為個人的生活過於浪費荒唐，就是日進千金，也是不夠揮霍的，何况在目下百物騰貴的時候，倘然自己不嚴格的把各項支出，來節制一下，到後來，一定會弄得入不敷出，於是不得不利用職權，敢行非法，這也是必然的趨勢，尤其是現在我們政府正在推行新運的時候，我們要刷新政治，軍事，敎育，以及一切的一切，都有朝氣，似非將一般國民（公務　此員即國民）的生活習慣，有以合理的調整和改善的必要。古人說：「習俗移人，賢者不免，」可是我們國民的生活習慣，有許多地方，實在是太不合理了。政府的公務員因生活不安，習於因循，不肯為國盡忠，為民服務。社會上的人民，習於逸樂，爾詐我欺，靑年的墮落放縱，成年的腐敗昏庸，富者則繁瑣浮華，貧者則卑汚投機囤積，希冀乘時發財。至於一般庸俗農夫，他們因為智識較低，祇知習於迷信，坐待天命，那是更加不必去談他了。試問舉國上下，大家祇知偷安僥倖，國家怎會不弱，社會怎能安寗，所以要繁衍我們羣衆的生命，保障我們社會的安寗，發展我們國民的生計，祇有從速將上述各種不良的習慣，一掃而廓淸之，並易之以合理的正常生活不為功。然而我國的傳統，總是不談廉潔問題則已，否則必然要求自政府官吏做起，因為官吏能以身作則，導之於前，示範人民，則人民自能內心悅服，相率改正，我寫到這裏，忽然想起了一件使我最痛心而又感到非常慚愧的事來，就是數年以前，我記得東亞同文醫院大學敎授小竹文氏，在日本報章上，曾經發表過一篇警吿日本國人勿為中國人所誘惑的文章，他說：「中國人興盛的原因，都因了中國歷朝　代的貪汚政治之所致。日本人一至了中國，凡意志不堅定的，大都被中國人所誘惑，而染成貪汚的習慣。」（其文意就筆者記憶所及大致如此）的確，中國過去的政治腐敗情形，原是不能掩飾的事實，以致失去了人民的信仰，及國際間的瞧不起。移至造成衰落不振的現象，所以要使一個國家能夠興盛，一定要做到政治淸明，社會喪飭，然後國內人心不會思亂。就是國外的人士，也會引起欽佩的觀念，孟子說：「夫人必自侮，然後人侮之：家必自殺，而後人毀之；國必自伐，而後人伐之。」也就是說明一個人，一個家，或者一個國家，都要自己好好的去努力，然後才能興盛的意思。</p>
<p>黨國先進陳公博先生，是提倡廉潔政治最力的一位，我記得他在國府還都以後，曾在南京發表過一篇論說，題是：「廉潔政治就是和平建國的基本條件，」文裏說：「自事變以後，重慶許多人們，借　統制的美名，發了許多國難財，人們談到了這些不肖的官吏，和不肖的商人，無不痛心切齒。可是我們，旣不忍重慶方面的人們，在那裏大發其國難財，我們就難道忍心袖手看着國民政府治下的人們，在那裏大發其和平財麼。我不禁大聲疾呼喚起我們有心和有志的人士注意。」還有上海市政府秘書長趙尊嶽先生，於本年元旦，在上海半月刋上，也發表過一篇很有意義的文章，他說：「上海多數人士，強梁者輒薄視法律，輕言公德，其次亦僅圖個人的享樂，而不注意整個之安寗，再次則惟利自圖，但博多金，便為能事，功利之毒，實深中於人心。凡此種種，小而言之，已不合目前之潮流，而徒自陷於痛苦之途；大而言之，其貽害於個人者尚小，貽害於國家者實多。」我們看完了陳趙兩先生的上面這二段話，我想凡是有志氣的中國靑年看了，一定會發生一種極大的感想吧！</p>
<p>所以我以為要使得國內政治廉明，一切的經濟，建設，軍事，敎育，都走上軌道，確非有請求政府，在國家財力可能範圍以內，儘量的來改善各級公務員的待遇，和合理的調整公務員之生活習慣不可，但是要改善公務員合理的生活，尤非先從速厲行節約運動不可，因為「儉」是「廉」的對象，不能尚儉的，根本就無法去叫他養廉。古人說：「勤能補拙，儉以養廉」。譬如一個天資極愚的人，不想方法，拿勤字來補救。或者一個奢習成性的窮人，不想拿儉字來糾正，到後來，一定會弄到更愚更窮的一天。現在中國的經濟狀况，正好像一個奢習成性的窮人一樣，一方輛啼飢號寒，連飯都沒有吃，而另一方面，還是窮者極慾的來過他繁華之夢。眞所謂一面花天酒地，一面飢寒交迫，這種畸形的現象，倘然不想方法，把他從事的挽救過來，我想我們整個的民族劣根性，一定會養成有不堪設想的地步。「節約」本來是我們中國固有的美德，可是自從英美的物質享受，和揮金如土的浪漫生活習慣，跟着侵略勢力，帶到中國以後，這種道德，便漸漸的消滅，而變成沒有了。現在我把這種沒人要，久遭着社會遺棄的優良美德「節約」重新拾起來，拿來提倡，當初雖然有一部份人會說，我思想落伍，但是也有一部份人，來同情我的主張。不但是同情，而且還蒙他們紛紛的用函電來勉勵督促，多要求我從速的來成立一個永久性的節約團體，不過我自己，總是始終不懈的來奉行，來愛戴，在現在英美尚未擊滅，大東亞戰爭尚未完成的時候，即照目前處境，雖竭力節約，恐已難圖茍且生存，不節約，則不久之將來的生活，更有不可思議之一日。節約運動之在現處境下，他給予人們需要程度之迫切，確是人同此心，心同此理的了。不過節約運動，第一要重實踐，決不是徒託空言，應先由本身做起，然後再求之於他人，先就可能範圍，並在不費時，不費錢之事做起，然後再行之於其他。能如此，方始不失提倡節約的眞義。大學有云：「修身而後家齊，家齊而後國治，國治而後天下平」。也就是這個意思。</p>

<p>— 青蓮</p>
<p>（九）文化生活</p>
<p>「七級浮屠」所象徵的緬甸文化，由公元一千零四十四年緬甸帝王中第一個偉人阿諾烏拉泰王定都派干，輸入佛敎文明，獎勵文物藝術之時開始昌盛的。常時建立的請寺院，與派千地方的織物，漆器工藝品等，都是表現緬甸文化的著名遺跡，派干朝消滅以後，東古，曼德勒王朝的歷史有了轉變，然而保持着派干文化充滿雄大的生氣的精神，誰說不曾遞嬗流傳在今日每一個緬甸民衆的血管裏呢？</p>
<p>英法勢力東漸，緬甸終於化爲殖民地戰塲，一千八百二十八年，英國以微細的藉口而對緬甸宣戰，占領了仰光，馬潼斑，達佛伊，庇古等地。經過一八五五年二次戰爭，至一八八五年第三次戰爭之後，緬甸完全淪亡，而從此開始了緬甸的黑暗時代。遠征阿薩密，馬尼哥和暹羅曾經威震東方的緬甸人的英美氣槪，在英國狡猾的懷柔政策下而日漸泯滅，而竟沉湎在怠惰逸樂的氛圍中。但是，這僅僅是些緬甸上流社會人士而已，大部分的緬甸人，如上面所述，他們不斷地淮行着反英獨立運動，民族文化運動，在廣大的中下層階級中萌芽而滋長起來，成爲民族解放運動中有力的主流！流不盡革命的熱血，正在灌漑緬甸民族文化的自由之花。</p>
<p>日本對緬甸文化政策的根本方針，首先在打破緬甸人「怠情的風氣」，而由日本人以身作則，爲東亞民族勤儉忠實的模範，排斥五十年來醞釀成熟的英國式的實利主義，重振東洋式的道義精神，爲此利用一切宣傳機關，而以介紹日本文化爲第一要旨；在各重要市鎭村落，遍設日語學校，努力於介紹日本現狀，發揚日本精神，推行日本文化。</p>
<p>宗敎在緬甸具有極大的影響，對於最大多數人民的僧侶及佛敎徒，固然不適於宣傳政治，但是日本決不放棄指導之責，早在去年七月，就號召緬甸僧侶組織「緬甸佛教聯盟」對他們灌溉關於建設東亞新秩序及緬人應負任務等政治常識</p>
<p>對於文化界，日水當局也力謀吸收，去年八月，即已羅致緬甸文化人，成立「緬甸又文化聯盟」，使努力於日本文化藝術之輸入，同時，指導行政府要人，報紙雜誌等的從業員，組織「日本文化研究所」，以便將日本文化的眞髓，導入緬甸人的生活中。</p>
<p>以「沒有文盲」出名的緬甸，初等敎育向由僧侶擔任，此外還有三數千家國立國民學校。軍政監部早曾努力於去年十二月八日開戰一周年紀念全部開校，並適應新事態而選定敎科書。</p>
<p>爲着推進敎育，爲對小中大學校敎育實行調訓計劃組織强力的機關，第一次於十月二十五日，調集敎師約一千人在仰光，授以新的敎育方針以適應大東亞戰爭及共榮圈建設。</p>
<p>緬甸在戰前原有仰光和瓦城兩大廣播無綫電台，日軍佔領後，即努力加以修復仰光廣播電臺於七月十五日開始播音，對國內特別對印度，作有計劃的廣廣播。</p>
<p>報章雜誌方面，戰前以首都仰光開始，以至瓦城等處，到處都有報紙雜誌，大都充滿自由主義的論調。大東亞戰爭發展到緬甸後即相繼停刊。現在仰光計有緬文報二種，印度文報三棟，和華文報一種，完全在日軍情報部的指導之下，展開建設新緬甸的輿論戰綫，兩種緬文報，爲遵奉日本的方針，最近預備合併。</p>
<p>緬甸在今日，無論在政治上，軍事上，及經濟上，都居於大東亞戰爭的第一綫。緬甸的動態，緬甸人的民族解放鬥爭，無疑的將爲全世界所注自的。緬甸決不會辜負東亞各民族和全世界被壓迫民族之期待的。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c63">建立決戰體制加強政治力量　華北政務委員會新措施 <a href="#c63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>中國參戰，是歷史上的轉換，趁這個機會，把華北政務委員會對國民政府的關係，予以調整和加强，同時華北政委會的本身，也努力加强，在這個基礎上，推進一切適應中日新關係的施策。自從國府參戰之後，北京和南京之問，有了不少的革新事件：決定了華北政務委員會及各總署各廳的組織條例，華北方面參加策劃全國經濟委員會和新運促進會，汪主席就任新民會的名譽會長，確立了舉國一致的參戰體制，廢除代替國旗的五色旗等，也都逐步實現，蘇淮地區的問題，因爲要調整一般法令，所以還有若干問題未決。但是華中，華北間的一切政治上懸案，統已解決，進一步的加强了國府和華北政務委員會的聯繫</p>
<p>同時華北政務委員會，實行改組，由朱深氏繼任委員長，刷新陣容，整頓戰時體制，加强政委會的政治力量。日本方面根據旣定國策，不借予以全面協力，以求造成中國人的中國，達到中日協力的眞正目標。</p>
<p>在國府參戰後的一個月，日本方面卽在二月八日實行對五十九家工廠解除軍管理關係，華北日軍爲求國府治下的民生安定，所以再度把對於民生有關的棉布，麥粉，紡織，電業等五十四家工廠，解除軍管理，又爲了加强參戰後的國府戰力，表示同生共死的精神起見，所以把軍管理的全部工廠，實行第三次解除軍管理關係，明確表示了尊重國府主權的原則。二月九日，將大東亞戰爭關係的新敵產七百四十九件，移交中國方面，英美等敵國在華北所有的莫大權益，也都移交中國方面。</p>
<p>事變之後，爲了處理中日雙方的一般事務而設立的特務機關，自三月一日起先把日僑事宜和物資移動關係事務，移交總領事館辦理，同時決定凡是涉及中國行政的事項，也將移交中國方面管理，今後省縣的政治，經濟，文化等項，完全歸中國方面單獨負責批進。</p>
<p>還有一點較大的變更，就是一向由日本軍担任的維持治安事宜，也讓給中國方面担任，這樣一來，日本軍可以專心致力於作戰，警備方面，從側面來支持新中國的建設，這種措置和加强華方國防體制，有速帶的關係，性質非常重要。</p>
<p>這次實施新政策後，有劃時代轉變的，就是新民會的性格問題，新民會是中國事變後成立的，實踐中日合作的民衆組織，內部的日本人，除了日籍副會長以外，還有許多日籍職員參加工作，自從　會長安藤紀三郞辭職後，改取最高顧問制度，推進工作，不遺餘力，貢獻於建設華北者極大，但是大東亞戰爭發生後，很多人以爲爲了適應新事態，加緊會務起見，必須更進一步來表明新民會的性格，但是也有人不贊成此議，主張堅持常初的性格，雖然會內有見仁見智的不同觀念，可是原則上都是爲了整個發展的善意。</p>
<p>後來軍部方面就下一個明確的定義，掃除了外界對於新民會性格的懷疑觀念，這一點對於未來的工作，有着莫大的貢獻。又爲表明名符其實是中國人的新民會起見，所以約有二千之多的日籍職員，大部份退出，祗留了顧問立塲或者技術指導地位的少數，會務的責任所在，已由事實表現得非常明確。</p>
<p>在華北方面轉換政策後的各項施政，相繼實行。此外治外法權撒廢後的最重要部份，就是經濟方面的調整，目下正在硏究辦法之中，日本轉換對華政策之後，一切建設新中國事宜，完全讓中國方面自己來負責裁決進行，確立了華北政委會的政治力基礎，今後中國方面的各項施策，如何來具體化的推進中日提携，這是必須要切實的幹去，上次的改組，也是爲了這一點着想。</p>
<p>在這個新局面下，荷起重任毅然登壇的朱深委員長，在他的就職宣言裏說：</p>
<p>目前最年要的問題，就是開發產業，民食問題更其是一個燃眉之急的問題。吾人以全責來處理物價問題，運輸問題，以及其他種種，希望盟邦日本多予協助。」在上面的幾句話裏，表明了强化政治力的前提。</p>
<p>有某一個熟稔日本的要人，他批評這次政策的轉換，非常巧妙。把中日關係的現狀，比喻爲一個寒熱厲害的病人，他說：</p>
<p>「譬如三十九度的寒熱，這次的措置，祇有减低一度寒熱的効果，但是抱着三十八度的平熱爲了要造成日俄戰爭之後那樣密切的中日親善關係，第一脫不了安定民生，亦就是把大乘的施策用小乘來實施，最最要緊。」以上的譬語，恐怕是中國方面對於轉換政策的一般見解。因爲現在華北的最重要問題，在於解決物價和食糧問題，生活指數高漲，物價奔騰，一部份的投機行爲，也是助長漲風原因之一。</p>
<p>物價如此的在漲，當然是投機心理，囤積收藏所造成的，不但刺激了食糧飛漲，同時還妨碍了一般物資的暢通，對於這種傾向，中日雙方正在從物資，通貸兩方面着手妥籌辦法，爲了此事，華北政務委員會，特地改組物價調整委員會及物資處理委員會，新設華北物資物價處理委員會，把食糧管理局和物資平衡資金運用委員會，附設在這裏，以謀物資物價的統一處理。</p>
<p>在目下的決戰時期，爲了克服困難，促進華北建設，達到大衆需求的使命，發　轉換政策後的成績起見，前途的種種荊棘猶多，戰爭時期的華北最大使命，就是要維持治安，增加重要資源的生產。憑交戰國一份子的地位來貢獻於增强擊滅英美的戰力，關於這一點，朱委員長在就任之初就力言要中日協力來發揮綜合戰力，表明應付嚴重局面的決心。今後使華化民衆了解在戰時下的國民意識，用斷然的決心和實踐力來打開這些難關，發揮華北政務委員會的最高政治力，推動一切施策，堅持中日同生共死的意義到底。（雲鵬：譯自三月十日大陸新報北京特電）</p>

<p>阿根廷國在舉世擾攘之中，鮮受戰爭影響，惟最近其農工業，亦已難免狂瀾之波及。蓋自美國宜佈不再派遣船隻駛往阿國之後，阿京佈埃諾斯港某日一晝夜間，竟無船隻出入，此爲百年來所未有。查截至目前爲止，阿國素以原料供給各交戰國，故獨享戰事繁榮，尤以運往英國之貨品爲最多。運英貨品，以肉類，小麥，皮貨等爲大宗，在歐戰爆發以前，阿根廷肉食出口約四十五萬噸，每年屠宰之牛，不下六百萬隻之多，而運往英國之小麥，每年亦達六百萬鎊之鉅，英國欲與阿國維持貿易關係，自無疑問。惟阿國運英貨品，多笨重之物，需要廣大之噸位，加以大西洋中，時有潛艇出沒，故英阿貿易大受影響。至美阿經濟關係，則不若英阿關係之重要，美國運阿之貨物，雖佔阿國進口之第二位，但美國購買阿國貨物，則極有限，遠在歐洲各國之下。蓋美國農業產品，多與阿國雷同故也。阿國與美國經濟關係，在牛時雖不甚重要，但年來則中立因關係，多少亦獲一部份利益，直至最近海洋貿易斷絕之後，始不得不調整本國經濟機構，以期適應新局勢。阿國政府鑒於美國燃油不能進口，乃竭力開發克英多洛里伐達維亞區之油田，去年該區石油生產，計一千五百萬桶，惟仍不足國內消費，乃決定提煉亞蔴子油，以資替代，適値亞蔴子近年無法出口，以之煉油，不管廢物利用。此外並於目前與玻利維亞成立協定，規定阿國以小麥交換玻國之油，近更與巴西進行商務談判，希望能自巴西輸入棉花，以代替美棉。不寗唯是，阿國政府自將商船收歸國有後，更積極從事造船，以圖發展海洋運輸。賈斯蒂洛總統更擬擴張工業，以圖自給，惟機器向依賴英德兩國供給，近因來源斷絕，其建設計劃，白不免遭受若干影響耳。總之，阿國因受戰事影響，海外貿易一落十丈，乃不得不與南美各國，尤其是昆鄰各國，進行談判，以期互通有無，促進經濟之發展云。（哈瓦斯九日里斯本電）</p>

<p>一昨支那情報有紀載上海市游資出路之檢討一文，略謂『本市游資充斥，已不待言。在茲統制日趨强化之今日，游資將向何處覓求出路，頗値硏究，茲言其大要於次：（一）食糧衣料等重要生活必需品，多爲定有公價之物資。投於此方面之資金，將來勢必有一部竄往非統制品之部門。（二）華股市價，因各廠棧存貨品之昂騰與機械設備評論之提高，故日見上昇。目前已有大量資金，流入股市。（三）土地建築物爲最安全之投資對象。房租雖受限制，而買賣則甚自由。敵性名義解除完了後，地產買賣勢必較前旺盛。故以買賣房地產爲主要業務之信託公司，最近已甚見增加。（四）今日上海投資對象，已不如以前之廣。觀此情形，將來將有更多之資金，流往內地』。</p>
<p>此一段文字，確有檢討之價値，而爲目前企業家値得注意之一點。第一，統制品有公定之價格，目逐漸行配給之制度，今後當然未可經營。即使欲經營物資之買賣，亦不得不集中視綫於非統制品之部門。第二，華商工廠，以房屋生財機器以及成品原料連鎖漲價，其資產之增値，爲必然之事實，故華股之價値，隨之上昇，自亦悄理以內之事實，如果依據法令，正式登記之工廠，其經營復爲合理化者，則其價格之增高，亦屬應有之結果，惟望各股票公司組織正式市塲，經營正常交易，與合法買賣，而一切行動當受制於同業公會，則社會上未始不能利用此項交易，以幫助工業之進展，旣爲正當之營業，自有合法之保護。第三，房地產爲投資最大之出路。巳往經營房地產者，過於冒險，或不能普遍，且操縱於少數地產商之手中。今後倘以合法之企業公司或信託公司出而主持，則土地及其建築物。原爲最安全之投資對象。確爲游資之一大歸宿。第四爲內地農村事業經營。凡小型工業手工業以及農村副產等等，無一不可投資與管理，俾農村於自給自足之外，復能將土貨土產輸出外埠，以換取日常必需之品，如是，則資金流入內地以後，仍得回歸都市。此均利用游資之最良方法，値得吾人之提倡。</p>

<h3 id="c81">所得稅在國家稅收上之重要性 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— 陳澤</p>
<p>所得稅爲國家之良稅，早爲舉世所公認。考之我國舉辦所得稅之建議，遠在遜淸末年，但距今已三十餘年，未迄實行。中間雖經過數度之議定及頒布，然直至民國二十四年七月，以財部因稅收短絀，國庫收入稅减，方始決定開徵所得稅，以資彌補。於是先後於民國二十五年七月，八月頒布「所得稅暫行條例」，及「所得稅暫行條例施行細則。」至此，我國財政稅收上，方有所謂所得稅之微收。旋因中日事變發生，所得稅之施行，復又無形停頓。故事實上，所得稅在我國稅收上所佔之地位甚少。</p>
<p>自國府還都以後，因力謀財政上之刷新，遂有徵收所得稅辦法之公佈。預料不久以後，所得稅便將成爲我國最重要之稅收。惟一般社會人士，恐仍有不明所得稅所當提倡之理由，故有輿論提倡解釋之必要，以期能普遍明瞭。</p>
<p>所得稅，簡言之，爲根據個人或公司之所得。而課徵之稅。其所以被推爲良好之稅制，不外下列幾種理由：</p>
<p>（一）負担普及——納稅為人民應蓋之義務。所得稅乃就所得之大小，分別課稅。任何人除其所得不及納稅標準外，均在徵稅之列。故所得稅不若其他各種直接稅之多限於局部，（如田稅祗及於農民），而不能普及。</p>
<p>負担公允——各種簡接稅，如統稅，印花稅，鹽稅均爲比例稅。故從貧富兩種階級之納稅能力言，富者負担較輕，而貧者負担反重，殊爲不均至於所得稅則不同，因其稅率乃爲以累進計算，所得愈大，則稅率愈高，故各人之納稅負担，係以其納稅能力比例爲增减，故合於賦稅公平之原則。</p>
<p>（三）富有伸縮性——國家量出爲入，其歲入之富有伸縮性者，歲出始可隨意增减。現代國際關係複雜，歲出之增减，常因戰事或其他原因，發生極大之變動。故賦稅之收入，貴有伸縮性。所得稅率，伸縮最便，其稅收之伸縮性亦最强，故國家得視財政上之需要，以高下其稅率。</p>
<p>（四）稅源充足——所得稅爲</p>
<p>普及徵課之國稅，其稅收之來源，乃爲來自全體人民之所得者，故稅收之充足，最不待言</p>
<p>（五）稅收確定——國家之賦稅，除稅源充足外，旨在稅收之確定。歲入倘無確定，則預算困難。所得稅爲直接稅，乃來自全體人民之所得，故卽有事變，其收入亦決不致若其他稅收之一無把握。</p>
<p>（六）適合非常時期之財政稅收——政府在非常時期中，其歲出必爲激增，除發行公債及利用通貨膨脹等等以籌措戰費外，增加稅率，亦爲一必然之法。惟租稅之增加，有直接及簡接兩種。簡接稅係採比例稅率，增加簡接稅，不但有違賦稅之公平原則，且得因戰事延長，而造成人民租稅負担之不均。反之，所得稅爲直接稅，其稅率爲採累進率制者，此外更有極良好之伸縮性，故當然極爲適合非常時期之採用。</p>
<p>綜觀上述各點，所得稅之爲良好稅制，當屬無疑。考之各國，所得稅之收入，無不佔全國國稅之大部份。根據調查所得，所得稅在美國佔國稅百分之五〇·七，在英國佔百分之四三·三，在法國佔百分之三〇·一，在日本佔百分之一〇·二，在意國佔百分之一四·二，在德國估百分之二三·六，反觀我國，過去之稅收，多以關稅，鹽稅，統稅等簡接稅爲主要稅收，而所得稅之開徵，則尙爲最近之措施。凡吾國民，允宜通力合作，更望政府當局，能以最大之努力，注意於所得稅之調查及監督，並設法促進會計之健全制度。</p>

<p>在中外古今的歷史上，不知有多少科學家·革命家·政治家·醫學家……，爲了要解除大衆的痛苦，謀人　的永遠幸福起見，把自己的生命犧牲了。</p>
<p>林肯爲了黑奴的自由，作不斷的奮鬭，愛迪生爲了人類的幸福，鎭日在實騐室中埋頭苦幹；威爾遜爲了世界的和平，到處的呼籲奔走。他們的胸懷是寬大的，他們的眼光是遠大的，他們不以一己的幸福爲生活目的。他們能爲千萬人着想，時時不忘周圍許多受着痛苦的人們；他們有着正義·熱血·同情，他們更有捨己爲羣的精神！</p>
<p>世界上快樂的人少而痛苦的人多。有不少人因着種種的壓迫，過着牛馬般的生活；他們失去了自由，沒有了應有的享受權利；他們的生命，永遠斷送在黑暗苦痛的深淵中。但，他們要有幸福！要有自由！他們渴望着正義的人們的救助和同情。</p>
<p>年靑的朋友們，我們不該有自私自利的小我觀念，我們的生命是屬於大衆的；我們應爲大衆而苦幹，我們要有捨己爲羣的精神，盡自己所有的力量，使一般受着痛苦的人們獲得解放！</p>
<h3 id="c89">尼采贈書瓦格湼（上） <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Lincoln　Schuster著　古心譯</p>
<p>—世界著名藝術家的書翰之一</p>
<p>前因　尼采（FriedriehNietzsche）還是一個年輕人的時候，和瓦格湼（Richard　Wagner）做了朋友，那時瓦格湼比他大三十歲，正是德國文化的中心人物。尼采，這位年輕的不可一世的哲學家，那時正在製作着鋼琴上彈奏的樂曲，對於瓦格湼的成就，眞是佩服得五體投地。他曾說過，「沒有了音樂，人生就是一個錯誤。」</p>
<p>瓦格湼在尼采的一生中發生了極大的影響。他們初次相遇的時候，瓦格涅正住在靠近巴塞爾（Basel）的地方，尼采則在巴塞爾的大學裏敎授着古典哲學。他們在一八六九年同度了耶穌聖誕，瓦格湼作了主人和敎師，尼采則作了他的鬥徒。</p>
<p>尼采受了瓦格湼的鼓勵，開始著作他的第一本書「由音樂精神中產生出來的悲劇」。他寂居在阿爾卑斯山麓的屋子裏，靜靜地思考着，形成了他的思想的核心，終於將這核心發展成爲他全部哲學的主題：「我第一次覺得，人生最有力最高尙的意志，並不能在苦苦爭取生存這事上表現出來，却在對於戰爭的意志，對於武力的意志，對於征服的意志這些事項上表現出來。」</p>
<p>尼采稱讚瓦格湼是「另外一個厄斯啟拉（Aeschyius），恢復了神話與　徵，又在酒神帶奧尼細阿（Dionysius）的在歡中，聯合了香樂與鼓聲…一個栖格夫里（Siegfried）），從來不懂得什麽叫作畏懼。……」他對於拜壘特（Bayreuth）的歌劇節，虔誠地致敬着，以爲是「出征時充滿着朝氣的表徵。」</p>
<p>不過，不久，這位年輕的英雄崇拜者，就變得喜歡批評，凡事尋根究底，以致逐漸改變了他的觀念。那時瓦格涅作成了「霧童族的戒指」（The　Ring．of　the　Nibelungs）獲得了「最高勝利，」世界上的王公大臣，都向他敬拜，而尼采則藉着天啟的目光，直看到舞臺的幕後者：他爲了他的所見，受到了震動與恐怖。他想，栖格夫里那樣的遊俠騎士，已經成爲巴息發爾（Pa　sifal）那樣的高等祭司；而他旣不願意再當一個小沙彌，又在哲學方面已經完全成熟，因此，他就不肯再燒香。但是瓦格湼却公然傲慢地要求他燒香。於是，尼采與瓦格湼的著名爭論，就此開始，此後意見愈鬧愈深，終於兩個老朋友絕了交。</p>
<p>最後，尼采悄悄地放棄了他的神與英雄，宣言說，他「深切地厭惡着一切婦人氣質和胡亂發在的事悄，這些事情是存在於浪漫主義，理想的說謊，人類良心的變軟這些事項上的，這些事項，曾使最勇敢的人中某一個人屈服過。」</p>
<p>這種學養上的不和，現在是不能調和的了。現在瓦格湼住在蘇倫多（Sorrento），從事那以巴息發爾爲主角的歌劇，尼采正和他作了鄰居，他們倆甚至不交一言。那位一度曾爲附庸的年輕人，現在是一個不妥洽的哲學家了，對於這位風糜一時的音樂大家，一毫沒有同情。他以爲瓦格涅是走江湖的騙子，只知稱頌着「憐憫，沒有皮慾的愛，耶穌的傻勁。「這話實際上就是尼采對那新歌劇的極端自我在發生衝突的原因——用門根（H．L．Menchen）的話來說，這話「好久以來，就成爲一個主題，發生出種種含胡的謠言和曖昧的耳語。」</p>
<p>在尼采寫下列這信之前不久，瓦格湼曾將新出版的巴息發爾歌劇，取出一本來，題了名字，送給尼采，作爲和好的表示，這時尼采則正在寫着「有人性，一切太有人性」這書，將他最近的藝術學說，寫在裏面，直接反對着瓦格湼的學說。那筆禮物送到的時候，尼采大受感動，據他的姊姊說，他想「瓦格湼一派的人，讀到了他所寫的那本書，要吃到何等大的驚嚇」，因此他就決定，將那本書用隱名的方法出版，而同時則寫這封信給瓦格湼，單獨地告訴他道本書的著作者是誰，「而對於他自己的思想獨立，則一些也沒有屈服。「這信並沒有注出日子，大約總是在一八七八至一八八〇年之間寫成的吧。</p>

<p>— 周夢雲</p>
<p>俗諺：「十個敎員九個窮。」自昔已然。負擔綦　的吾，當然更不例外。可是，十四年來的敎員生活，並不厭惡，而相反的却有相當的好感：因此對於友好們的美意推薦，改業商塲，與家人等的勸吿良圖，終於付諸心領，僅表感謝而已。所謂：「人不堪其憂，回也不改其樂。」而渺小的我，也算樂在其中矣。</p>
<p>托爾斯泰說：生活並不是享樂，而是很辛苦的工作。」左拉在晚年回憶他從前的苦况：「那時候我有了麵包，和馬鈴薯，便足以充飢，偶而弄到一支臘燭，能　夜書，便有升天似的快樂。」本來越是辛苦工作，淸苦生活，意志越是堅强，生存愈有價値。精神有寄托，即是享受差些，便無所謂痛苦。孔子云：「飯蔬食，飲水，曲肱而枕之，樂亦在其中矣。不義而富且實，於吾如浮雲。」雖然不敢比擬聖賢豪傑，却很願　這徵文機會，寫些日常生活，希冀多加敎正。</p>
<p>（甲）進修問題　我的進修功夫，終覺不够，朱免躭心，因爲敎育是跟着時代而革新，而前進的，應與社會現實相適合；所以對於課本的內容探討，與敎授法的硏求改進，應富不斷的充分進修，才有成效，才能問心無愧。尤其我並不是正途出身的敎員，根底淺薄，更爲需要。換句話說：便是不當敎員，也應多讀書籍，培養知識：因爲光有道德良心，而沒有知識，還是不够條件。近年來因爲種種問題，致進修時間，比較往昔短少三分之二，吾想從今天起，設法彌補。</p>
<p>（乙）衣着問題　我對於衣飾，素來隨便；尤其近三年來的冬季，始終夾袍，單褲。習慣成自然，倒也並不覺得怎樣。獨有「皮鞋」却是我的恩物；因爲跑路痛快，確爲「布鞋」所不及。我的「皮鞋」都從各處的舊貨攤上購來。的確價廉。鞋頭·鞋跟·每部份都加鐵釘，更見經濟實惠。</p>
<p>（丙）伙食問題　因爲兼課太散漫，中膳不便返家；但是難得上飯館。自知超等飯量，佐餐祇得靑菜·豆腐。其餘隨便買些乾點充飢。家庭方面，吾是排定日程：逢一·三·五日。「戶口米拚煮苞米粥。」二·四·六日。「拌碎米粉，外加黄豆芽。」（或靑菜菠菜）七·八·九日「靑菜（或菠菜·條黄豆芽·或小交菜。）下麵或。逢十日，「戶口米煮赤豆飯」（小菜由內人主辦）這樣搭配，行之已久。關於伙食問題，似乎並不感覺十分嚴重；而且七口之家，個個手脚輕健。</p>
<p>（丁）住屋問題　衣·食不計好壞，住屋却是不肯將就，這是我的一貫政策。三層寬大統樓，終算舒適。前樓面南，陽光充足。闢爲硏究室，個別敎課室，同時也作我個人臥室；因爲素來喜歡睡「硬松板」，來得痛快。近頃越發激底，借重「地板」，更見自由。後樓妻兒住宿，因爲家具簡單，尙能整潔。美中不足，便是二房東囑我電燈自理，至今尙未裝置分表。起初燃點「洋燭」，委實負担不起。而今改用豆油，燈草生活」，勉强支持。我很欽佩本屆四位　課學員，第一位是某大學經濟系李君，第二位是河南路新泰號袁君，第三四位是東方化學工業社顧鍾二君。每夜在這設備不全的「豆油燈下聚精會神，研習學科；並且額外自動津貼油費。這種好學態度，和互助精神，値得欽佩。</p>
<p>我的生活，雖然淸苦，尙能自得其樂。總之「學問·能力，要看勝如吾的，待遇享受，要看不如我的。」自然心安理得。長男今年二十歲，去年錄取於某大書店總管理處，多蒙經理提携，擢升會計，略能補助家用。可是，我每次通信裏面，終有這樣一套，好像例行公文。</p>

<p>量大福大！早上担憂夜頭的米，半飢半餓，牛馬似的終日拖磨着天賦的生命，爲着社會安寗也不敢違章犯法，這種人的大量已經不能再大了。</p>
<p>利用院子種菜可以幫助民生經濟。一間方丈的亭子間，父母妻子八個人，身也翻不過來。這樣處境的人，上海何止十分之八？住宅有空地的人，花木比菜更要緊了！</p>

<p>『別人還好，』二個眉頭突然鬥了　來，『就是大根不好，已經病了一個月多些了！』</p>
<p>『今天你是—』說到這裏，她忽然回頭對她的父親說，『爹爹，你總還記得三個月之前躲在他家的情形吧！爹爹，你總要多多應酬些。』</p>
<p>『不，三小姐』，根明連忙說，『我不是來借錢的，是來賣田的。』</p>
<p>『賣田？賣了那裏有得種？』詫異的神色。</p>
<p>『三小姐你不懂，』兪篤問代爲解釋，『賣了也有得種的，不過要還租罷了。』</p>
<p>「能够不賣麽？」她的問話表面上是對根明而發的，但她那明亮的眼光，在問這句話時，却向她的父親掃射了一下。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Further Discussion on Enhancing Wartime Production <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's discussion, "Stabilizing the Market and Increasing Production," briefly outlined that stabilizing currency value and enhancing production are the two major factors in improving the effectiveness of price controls, resolving commodity price issues, and realizing the guiding principles of wartime economic policy. If we do not actively strive from these two perspectives, all economic policies will inevitably fail, achieving at most "twice the effort for half the results." In particular, enhancing production is an even more crucial policy for the present and future. We believe it is necessary to further deliberate on specific methods.</p>
<p>First, state-owned enterprises, enterprises operated by the Japanese in China, and Sino-Japanese jointly operated enterprises must be adjusted. Their structures must be improved, and their efficiency enhanced to fully meet the actual needs of wartime and post-war, and to realize the ideal of the Greater East Asia Economic Co-prosperity Sphere. In particular, our country's state-owned enterprises, and the enemy assets to be taken over and managed in the future, should make full use of their production equipment and existing manpower. All specialized technical personnel should be guaranteed their positions, so they can make the most of their abilities. All idle personnel should be transferred to other positions. We must recognize that in the current situation, if several factories are nominally established, but in reality only serve to accommodate some personnel, it will not benefit the enhancement of production.</p>
<p>Second, all private enterprises, whether operated by Chinese or by people from friendly nations, should be treated equally. The government should provide as much assistance as possible to private enterprises operated by Chinese. Currently, the percentage of production volume accounted for by state-owned and Japanese-operated enterprises is still far less than that of private enterprises. Among private enterprises, daily necessities produced by modern industry are of particularly important value. If we fully develop small and medium-sized production enterprises in our country, then the production quantities of rice milling in food, cotton yarn and cloth in clothing materials, and matches and soap in daily necessities will certainly not be matched by the production capacity of state-owned enterprises in the future. In order to develop production, we must see this situation clearly and remove all artificial obstacles. Especially today, as we prepare and implement comprehensive control of materials, we must take care of and support private small and medium-sized production. Phenomena that hinder production, impede transportation, and even contribute to hoarding should be quickly liquidated.</p>
<p>Third, in future tax systems, there should be a distinction between industry and commerce. We should levy commercial taxes and give preferential treatment to production. If an excessive profits tax or income tax is implemented on industry, the object should be individual income and profits, not industrial organizations. Increases in indirect taxes should also be handled with caution. If there are numerous checkpoints and repeated taxation, it will only increase the burden of freight transport, which is extremely detrimental to stabilizing commodity prices.</p>
<p>Fourth, national financial institutions must conscientiously take responsibility for supplying short-term working capital for industry and mining, strengthen the handling of discounting, mortgage loans, and acting as agents for issuing corporate bonds, preferred stocks, and guaranteed interest stocks. When necessary, the government can provide long-term loans. At the same time, restrictions on commercial loans and the use of idle funds must also be further effectively addressed, creating favorable conditions for increasing production in finance.</p>
<p>Fifth, the relevant authorities must support industrial and mining production enterprises and solve the problems of a lack of certain technical personnel and raw materials and equipment. With a guiding and supportive attitude, they should encourage public and private enterprises to manufacture those scarce and urgently needed materials. Under the existing technical and material conditions, we firmly believe that the development of production in the peaceful areas has a promising future. As long as the government puts in a little more effort in guidance and support, the production industry will surely develop rapidly.</p>
<p>In addition, we cannot ignore that, on the one hand, we must improve the working conditions of workers, and at the same time strengthen work intensity, increase the number of shifts, and implement full-day production (i.e., abolishing the distinction between day and night). This is the main method used by various countries with advanced modern science to increase production. On the other hand, in view of the characteristics of China's economic structure and social organization, we should also strive to encourage handicrafts, rural sideline industries, and home industries, and develop production in towns and villages, which is also an important way to increase military and civilian supplies during wartime. These two measures can also improve the lives of workers, farmers, and ordinary people, and have extremely significant political and social implications.</p>
<p>Improving wartime production efficiency is also consolidating the foundation for the construction of a new China after the war. The main principles and specific methods we have proposed in the past two days are by no means rash statements, but rather the conclusions of careful research based on our country's national conditions and the sentiments of the people, for the independence of China and East Asian co-prosperity. We hope that relevant parties will pay attention to and refer to them, or even further research and implement them. This would truly be the fortune of China and the blessing of East Asia.</p>

<h3 id="e2">A Farce in London <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>The farces staged by Britain and the United States one after another are endless. In the most recent highlight, the Casablanca talks, Anglo-American entanglements over North Africa occurred. The United States used fifty old destroyers to seize more than a dozen British bases in the Western Hemisphere in the form of a ninety-nine-year lease. If another fifty ships are supplied, they will become completely American territory, and the American side is very enthusiastic about this. This time, the dispute between the Soviet Union and Poland was also brought to the stage by Britain and the United States, and audiences around the world appreciated the rarest farce of the moment.</p>
<p>In the prelude to this World War, the Polish government-in-exile, which collapsed just a month later, demanded the recovery of lost territories from the Soviet Union from London, which the Soviet Union refused. Britain and the United States believed that the Soviet Union's behavior was simply challenging the Atlantic Charter, and a ghost drama came to a close. However, Czech government leaders such as Beneš, who were also exiled in London, sympathized with the Soviet Union and opposed Poland, so the program notes for this play are extremely complicated.</p>
<p>Which part of the Atlantic Charter did the Soviet Union challenge? It should be referring to the second item, in which the free will of the local residents should be given the greatest attention when modifying territories, and the third item, in which the sovereignty and autonomy of all peoples and residents should be respected. So, is the Soviet Union unwilling to be bound by the status quo-maintaining charter of Britain and the United States? In the eyes of Britain and the United States, if they acknowledge the Soviet Union's behavior, they will lose the trust of the ghost governments. So, if the Soviet Union insists on its current attitude, how will Britain and the United States deal with it? This is the central point of interest in this play.</p>
<p>The ghost government regards the Soviet Union as an opponent, which is a strange thing in the eyes of the Soviet Union. In fact, the independence of Poland and the Czech Republic has already perished, and they are not normal countries. Is it not an incredible thing to want to maintain contact with the real world in the ghost world and to continue to be active? Is it not another incredible thing that two countries that were already at odds in the real world continue to roar at each other after becoming ghosts? It is even more incredible that Britain and the United States hold these two ghosts tightly in their arms as allies. (Xiang: Translated from the Western Daily News, March 6)</p>

<h3 id="e5">Chief of the Press Department of the Japanese General Headquarters, Major General Yagihagi, Gives a Speech, Acknowledging the Great Significance of the Russo-Japanese War <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency): Major General Yagihagi, Chief of the Press Department of the Army of the Japanese General Headquarters, gave a speech at the Kyouritsu Auditorium here today, stating that the Russo-Japanese War was the first step in building a new order in East Asia. The Manchurian Incident, the Sino-Japanese War, and the Greater East Asia War can be said to be the continuation and development of the Russo-Japanese War. After the Russo-Japanese War, Japan leaped to become one of the world's great powers, and its great significance in world history lies in the fact that Japan, an East Asian nation, effectively struck at Western imperialism, which was invading East Asia. Reviewing the late 19th century, after Da Gama sailed around the Cape of Good Hope and raised the Portuguese flag in India, most of East Asia was effectively under the control of the two oceans. However, Japan, a small island nation in East Asia that was despised by them, defeated Russia, which they considered the strongest of the Western powers, and suddenly made the East Asian nations realize that the idea of Western superiority was wrong, and promoted the establishment of a constitutional system similar to Japan and the construction of independent and self-reliant new countries. The main reason why revolutionary movements to overthrow autocratic regimes occurred in countries such as China, India, Persia, and Turkey was also this. The Russo-Japanese War can be called the prelude to the holy war of East Asian nations against Western domination of the world and the liberation of East Asia, said Major General Yagihagi. Major General Yagihagi then recounted the course of the Russo-Japanese War, saying that the Japanese army fought with a small number of troops and in an inferior position. He then expressed his determination to defeat Britain and the United States in this war, stating that the Russo-Japanese War was caused by Russia's unprovoked act of aggression. The Russian army launched an expedition outside its borders, traveling thousands of miles. It was repeatedly defeated on land and sea. After the war began, a revolution broke out in Russia, and the people's hearts became increasingly shaken. Later, the President of the United States mediated a ceasefire. However, in this Greater East Asia War, Japan's national strength is stronger than before, and the scale of the war is even larger. The complexity of the current international situation and the significance of the war are no longer comparable to those of the past. As President Hitler said, the outcome of this war will not be as simple as in the past, with just a victor and a loser. Only the victor can survive in the world, and the loser will perish. We can only rely on the movement of the nation to strive for the final victory, he said. During the Russo-Japanese War, the United States came forward to mediate, and Britain concluded an alliance with Japan, which was of some help to Japan. However, this kind of assistance was not out of sincerity. Their purpose was to use Japan to thwart Russia's momentum and to sacrifice Japan to consolidate their rights and interests in East Asia. Therefore, they were not pleased that Japan won and established a solid position in East Asia. After the end of the Russo-Japanese War, Britain and the United States adopted a policy of preventing Japan from developing towards the continent. The outbreak of World War I caused them to temporarily adopt a passive attitude towards this kind of prevention policy. However, after defeating Germany, they exposed their ambition to invade East Asia, oppress Japan, and sow discord between China and Japan, in an attempt to reap the benefits. In order to realize the great ideal of Hakko Ichiu, Japan must eliminate the evil forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia, otherwise it will be difficult to build a new order in East Asia. If the ambition of Britain and the United States is not stopped, East Asia will never have a day of peace and happiness. On this 38th Army Memorial Day, our people vow to serve bravely, defeat Britain and the United States, and keep the Holy Emperor safe.</p>

Here, I swear to Chairman Wang that I am determined to support the national policy and cooperate in the Greater East Asia War.</p>

<h3 id="e15">Moscow Military Newspaper Announces Soviet Army Withdraws from Seven Cities Intense Fighting Southwest of Kharkov German Threat to Donets Basin Eliminated <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Angara, 10th (Haitong News Agency) - According to a military report published in Moscow today, Soviet forces have withdrawn from seven cities, including Krasnograd, Rossosh, Krasarmeysk, Kramatorsk, Pervomaisk, Slavyansk, and Lisichansk. Intense fighting is ongoing southwest of Kharkov. This is the first time the Soviet military authorities have released these place names. As such, the German army's 100-kilometer position in the Donets Basin is no longer in danger of being invaded by Soviet forces, and a large number of troops in the southern sector will not be cut off, it is said.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 10th (Havas News Agency) - Yesterday, German forces launched several counter-attacks west of Rostov. The offensive against Kharkov continues to make progress. Soviet troops are continuing to increase pressure in the central Vyazma area. The German army has occupied Valki and Lyubotin near Kharkov, and several railways leading to Kharkov have been cut off by German forces. Only the Kharkov-Akhtyrka railway line is still being resisted by the Red Army. However, according to Berlin reports, the Red Army there has also been defeated. In addition, recent German war reports state that although the central Red Army continues to attack, they are being strongly resisted and contained by German rearguard units. The main German forces are able to withdraw according to the planned schedule. Moscow sources say the central Red Army's offensive is mainly aimed at Vyazma, which is a barrier to Smolensk. The main Red Army forces are now attacking in two directions: one from Sychevka (less than 25 miles from Vyazma) along the railway line, and the other from Moscow along the railway line. According to the most recent Moscow reports, the Red Army has reached Serhiy Ivanovsky, 20 miles east of Vyazma.</p>
<p>German Army Withdraws from Baer City Romanian Army Repels Landing Soviet Forces</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Allied News Agency) - The German High Command announced today that the German army has successfully withdrawn from Bely (southwest of Rzhev and 75 miles northwest of Smolensk). Before withdrawing, the German army destroyed all defensive installations and transported away all movable war equipment.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Haitong News Agency) - Soviet troops landed in Tsemes Bay, north of Novorossiysk, and were severely attacked by the Romanian army, suffering approximately 4,000 casualties and losing a large amount of military supplies. The Romanian army repelled the invading enemy forces several times.</p>
<p>German Army Shortens Central Battle Lines According to Planned Schedule</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Allied News Agency) - Official circles here claimed last night that the German army launched a fierce counter-attack in the Kharkov area, the former capital of Ukraine, and after occupying Lyubotin and Valki, repelled the Soviet reinforcements on Monday and advanced about 25 kilometers. Valki is located about 50 miles southwest of Kharkov. German troops, working closely with German Air Force dive bombers, continued to press the Soviet positions west and southwest of Kharkov, and cut off several highways and railways, including the railway between Kharkov and Poltava. After fierce fighting, the German army annihilated a Soviet infantry division and destroyed 23 tanks. To the north, the Soviet army launched large-scale offensives northwest and southwest of Kursk and Orel, as well as south of Lake Ilmen near Staraya Russa. On Monday, the German army acted according to a pre-determined plan aimed at shortening its central front line south of Rzhev and west of Gzhatsk. In the Kursk-Orel area, the Soviet army deployed fresh troops and repeatedly attacked the German defense line. However, the slight advances made by the Soviet army in this area in the previous weeks did not compensate for the heavy losses in manpower and material resources. South of Lake Ilmen, the Soviet army also launched repeated attacks in the Staraya Russa area. The German army, after withdrawing from Demyansk, held its ground. The Red Army deployed fresh troops for combat on Monday, but made no progress. On the Mius River front north of Taganrog, and in the Kuban region of northwestern Caucasus, there were only minor engagements on Monday. The German army defeated several small Soviet units and held Novorossiysk on the Black Sea coast. North of Ilmen, on the Leningrad and Lake Ladoga front, there were no major incidents. However, German heavy artillery resumed shelling the factories and railway facilities of Leningrad and Schlisselburg.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a cable from San Francisco, a spokesman for General MacArthur, commander-in-chief of the anti-Axis forces in the Southwest Pacific, issued a statement on the 9th, warning Australians about the threat of Japanese air power. The statement said that the Japanese air force units in the northern waters of Australia still pose a formidable threat. Although the anti-Axis forces have inflicted damage on the Japanese air force in the past, the Japanese military is now actively strengthening its forces. Japanese air force pilots are highly skilled, and Japanese aircraft performance is also surprising. Therefore, we should not underestimate the threat of Japanese attacks on Australia, it said.</p>

<h3 id="e21">Stanley's Speech Not Authorized by U.S. Government Undersecretary of State Declares No Responsibility for This Willkie Deeply Concerned About Causing Doubt <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Havas News Agency) - According to news from Washington, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Admiral Stanley, and U.S. Vice President Wallace, have recently made speeches on U.S.-Soviet relations, causing surprise across the United States. Ambassador Stanley declared at a press conference in Moscow that Soviet authorities are trying to create the impression, both domestically and abroad, that they are fighting alone, and deliberately conceal the assistance they receive from the Allied countries, especially the United States. When asked about these remarks to Undersecretary of State Welles, Welles stated that the government could not be held responsible. It is claimed that everything Ambassador Stanley said was not referred to the U.S. government beforehand, nor was it authorized by the government. He has cabled the ambassador asking for the contents of his speech, but has not yet received a reply. Republican leader Willkie believes that it is too radical and reckless for U.S. government officials to publicly make such remarks on U.S.-Soviet relations. He hopes that "everything Stanley said will not cause doubt in the existing understanding between the Allied countries." As for Vice President Wallace's remarks, Willkie criticized, "One representative of the government (referring to Wallace) implied that we might sell out the Soviet Union after the war, while another (referring to Stanley) claimed that the Soviet government is currently insincere to us. From my point of view, the United States has done its utmost to assist the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union should trust us more. As for the second front, the Soviet side wants us to fulfill our duties soon and immediately open a second front in Europe. Because of the difficulties of the Red Army on the Eastern Front, they believe that this is the best strategy for the Allied countries today, but our military authorities do not think so. History will reveal who is right or wrong in the future. Because news and propaganda are subject to censorship today, all countries want to convince their people of their actions, so there is no possibility of obtaining an accurate judgment." In addition, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Bloom, believes that Stanley's remarks are a very unfortunate incident. He claims that he has read all the Soviet newspapers subscribed to by the State Department and found that these newspapers have published as much news as possible about the assistance given to the Soviet Union by the United States. In addition, the New York Times stated that some believe that Stanley's remarks are sufficient to promote the passage of the Lend-Lease Act amendment in order to control shipments to the Soviet Union. This is the private view of some members of Congress. If American envoys cannot gain trust in the country where they are stationed, especially in a country that receives significant American aid and becomes the biggest burden on American taxpayers, then such a statement will surely arouse the emotions of the American Congress. As for Wallace's remarks about Soviet betrayal, it is actually dangerous. It is not that there will be an armed conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union, but that cooperation between the two sides will fail. Moreover, the border issues in Eastern Europe will cause all kinds of difficulties, so one must be careful.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Firm Belief in Destroying Britain and America For Army Day <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The Battle of Mukden, which established the foundation of the imperial country, was 38 years ago. March 10th marks the glorious and immortal Army Day, and during this time of decisive battle, hundreds of millions of citizens feel all the more invigorated. At the time, Japan, in view of Russia's deployment of troops and strengthening of its Far East military preparations, felt that if it relaxed in the slightest under such military pressure, it would be forced into a desperate situation, which could be described as an unprecedented national crisis since the founding of the country.</p>
<p>At that time, the Russian army, after defeating Napoleon's army that swept across Europe, boasted of its invincible strength in the world, exceeding us by more than ten times in terms of military strength, and possessing excellent and sharp weapons. Although Japan was blessed by heaven and divine assistance, it was not an enemy that could be easily defeated, and it was indeed a formidable foe.</p>
<p>When the cabinet meeting was convened on February 4 to decide on the opening of the Russo-Japanese War, Prime Minister Katsura issued a message to arouse the determination of the people, stating that: "Although we do not have the certainty of victory, we must also rely on the traditional spirit to fight to the death." Under the unanimous courage of the whole country, advancing one after another, the country finally exceeded the world's expectations, causing the strong Russia to yield and overcoming an unprecedented national crisis. The serious situation Japan is encountering today is not as serious as the Russo-Japanese War at that time. Since the beginning of the war, the irresistible imperial army has repeatedly achieved brilliant victories, and its majesty has spread throughout the world. From the snow-covered Aleutian Islands in the north to the malaria-ridden islands of the South Pacific in the south, all key points are in our grasp, and a solid and unshakeable strategic situation has been established. However, the enemy is still actively counterattacking.</p>
<p>Roosevelt once boasted: "In order to ensure Japan's final defeat, we will attack each of the islands scattered across the Pacific one by one, no matter how time-consuming and laborious it may be." Therefore, it is not possible to rashly conclude that the United States' counterattack against Japan is just talk on paper, or a farce to disrupt the occupied territories. In fact, the United States is currently focusing on expanding military production, while also specifically strengthening aid to Chongqing, increasing the air force in Chongqing, strengthening the defense of Australia and the bases on the islands of the South Pacific, and preparing step by step for a counterattack against Japan. Its ambition to achieve its goals should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>The future American counterattack will be a planned and organized counterattack, which is the stage of the final decisive battle between Japan and the United States. It is generally believed that this greatest decisive battle is imminent. The Japanese army has already consolidated the outer defenses of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, with sufficient military strength, and has the power to destroy the enemy's counterattack anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Japanese army stationed in China occupies four-tenths of the entire Chinese territory, from Mongolia and Ordos in the north to Guangdong Province and Hainan Island in the south. Recently, in order to prevent the movements of the Chongqing army, it has advanced into Guangzhou Bay, the French leased territory on the Leizhou Peninsula. The battle line has been extended to 7,000 kilometers, and the highest pressure is constantly being exerted on Chongqing. After the National Government joined the war, 300,000 elite troops were deployed on the Chinese front, forming a solid as gold soup situation, making the Chongqing-U.S. cooperation plan for a counterattack impossible. The combat power of the Japanese army stationed in China is becoming more and more substantial, the morale is high, and it can launch positive offensives against various war zones in Chongqing anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>The Japanese army's victory on the mainland is beyond doubt, and in various parts of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, an absolutely invincible strategic situation has been established, and we are convinced that the final victory will belong to us. However, the world war situation is becoming more and more serious. In this year, it can be said that the fierce battles every day are decisive for success or failure, and are a serious stage for determining the rise and fall of the country. Therefore, in today's decisive battle, we hundreds of millions of citizens must exert all our strength, be determined to sacrifice private interests for the public good, and go to the national crisis together. We must carry on the glorious tradition of defeating the strong enemy Russia to today's war. At this time of decisive battle, we are pleased to celebrate this great Army Day, the significance of which is profound. (Yunpeng: Translated from the March 10th Dalian News)</p>

<p>On the front lines, after days and nights of continuous fighting, not a drop of water enters the mouth. At this time, the soldiers are all dreaming of water. In their dreams, they are drinking the gurgling, clear water flowing in the river. Waking up from the dream, if it were in their home country, they would never drink water from rivers like these.</p>
<p>The soldiers' thirst for water deeply moves us. Without a drop of water to moisten the throat, gritting their teeth, and fighting with all their heart, this spirit is truly the posture of a god.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Steel Industry: Important Overview of Japan (4) <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>With the progression of the China Incident, the United States adopted various means of pressure against Japan, one of which was the comprehensive ban on the export of pig iron and steel materials to Japan in December of Showa 15 (1940). At that time, the Japanese steel industry relied heavily on overseas suppliers for scrap iron and steel materials. Therefore, the United States' intimidating export ban undeniably dealt a considerable blow to Japan. However, conversely, the Japanese steel industry was thus able to break away from its traditional dependence on overseas sources, providing Japan with an opportunity to move towards self-sufficiency in steel. Against the backdrop of this steel situation, the Iron and Steel Control Association was established with the promulgation of the Important Industries Association Order in April of Showa 16 (1941). Given the circumstances of its establishment, the Control Association aimed to establish an autonomous steel industry within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, with the primary objective of comprehensively managing the steel industry to complete the national defense system. Subsequently, it was reorganized in accordance with the implementation of the Important Industries Association Order to promote the grand goal of steel self-sufficiency. At the same time, it constantly held a leading position in the steel industry to cope with the changing circumstances before and after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Looking at the members of the Iron and Steel Control Association, the current state of the Japanese steel industry includes a total of forty-nine companies, comprising thirty-eight production companies, four raw material and sales companies, and seven participants from Manchuria. Among the production companies, Nippon Steel Corporation (Nittetsu), Nippon Kokan, Nakayama Steel Works, Kokura Steel, and Amagasaki Iron &amp; Steel are engaged in integrated steel operations. Other companies, such as Kobe Steel, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Amagasaki Steel, Sumitomo Metal Industries, Azuma Steel, Koa Steel, Daido Steel, Mitsubishi Steel, Japan Special Steel Tube, and Kotobuki Heavy Industries, do not have blast furnace facilities for producing pig iron from ore, but only use open-hearth furnaces to produce steel materials and specialty steel. Among the steel production companies, Nittetsu and Nippon Kokan hold extremely important positions and can be regarded as Japan's two major representative companies. Nittetsu, in particular, has a semi-national policy company nature, with equipment and scale of great magnitude, accounting for more than half of Japan's steel production volume. Nippon Kokan adopts the Thomas steelmaking process, making it Japan's only iron manufacturing company using this method, which is extremely advantageous for processing low-quality ore. Therefore, Nittetsu also adopted it last December.</p>
<p>Among the raw material and sales-related companies, the Iron and Steel Raw Material Control Company and the Iron and Steel Sales Control Company are wholly funded by the Iron and Steel Control Association, with Control Association staff concurrently serving as presidents, making them purely internal organizations. First, the Iron and Steel Control Association centrally purchases pig iron, semi-finished products, iron ore, scrap iron, and coal for ironmaking, etc. Then, the Iron and Steel Raw Material Control Company appropriately allocates them according to the production ratios of the various steel companies. The products produced by each steel company are centrally purchased by the Iron and Steel Sales Control Company and sold to consumers through various retailers in accordance with the instructions of the Iron and Steel Control Association. Therefore, the steel industry, from production to distribution and consumption, is implemented under a consistent plan.</p>
<p>The production companies participating from Manchuria include Showa Steel Works, Moye Coal &amp; Iron Company, Anshan Steel, Manshu Ruhr, Manshu Sumitomo Metal Industries, and Nichiman Steel Pipe, a total of six companies. Among them, Showa Steel Works is engaged in integrated pig iron and steel operations, established in Showa 4 (1929), and was the first company to engage in operations in Manchuria. Currently, it has joined the Manchurian Heavy Industries Development Company, and its ironmaking equipment and production volume are second only to Nittetsu. It exports a large amount of pig iron and steel materials every year, which Japan relies on heavily. For the year Showa 17 (1942), the planned amount of pig iron that could be exported to Japan has already been transported, and it is said that the planned amount of steel materials has also been reliably exported.</p>
<p>Last December, the North China Iron &amp; Steel Company, newly established in North China, held its inaugural general meeting. The company's factory is still under construction. When the company begins operations, it will be a further step towards establishing a self-sufficient system of Japan, China, and Manchuria. The expectations for Showa Steel Works and North China Iron &amp; Steel will become increasingly important in the future.</p>
<p>Due to the progression of the war, steel production is clearly in an emergency state. If the scope of operations expands, the demand for iron to manufacture weaponry and materials will naturally increase. On the other hand, if the sea area of operations expands, the production of iron will face many difficulties due to transportation and various other factors. Currently, the mission of those involved in iron manufacturing is to overcome this contradiction and ensure production. Last December, the Iron and Steel Control Association, in its council meeting, specifically proposed various countermeasures such as dramatically increasing domestic iron ore production, improving ore quality, recovering and utilizing scrap iron, utilizing domestic powdered ore, regional self-sufficiency of raw material coal, overcoming the decline in the quality of inferior coal, increasing the efficiency of overland connection and transportation of raw materials and products, promptly establishing small-scale smelting furnaces in iron ore resource areas, and promoting the increase in steel imports from Manchuria, in order to achieve the planned production volume for the second half of last year.</p>
<p>However, after strengthening domestic ore self-sufficiency, the decline in ore quality may reduce steel production. To compensate for this deficiency, the blending ratio of scrap iron is increased. Therefore, the maximum recovery of scrap iron becomes necessary. Regarding the recovery of metals, the Metal Recovery Control Company was established in June of last year, absorbing the Japan Scrap Iron Control Company, the former Steel Control Company, and the Wartime Materials Utilization Association, merging them into a unified implementation organization to recover old metals from factories, businesses, and general households. Starting this year, in order to thoroughly improve peacetime industries, it is hoped that the public will voluntarily offer waste metal scraps. In this session of the Diet, the government also solemnly declared that it would organize a new recovery organization. Regarding transportation issues, consideration is being given to constructing ironmaking facilities such as blast furnaces and small-scale smelting furnaces in iron ore source areas. Small-scale smelting furnaces, in particular, require simple construction materials and do not take much time, so they have become an immediate issue and are already being planned by Nittetsu, Nippon Kokan, Kotobuki Heavy Industries, and other companies. The construction areas will extend beyond Japan to Manchuria, North China, Taiwan, and other places.</p>
<p>Due to this urgent situation in steel production, the control of steel has also made significant progress with the implementation of the Factory and Business Management Order and the revision of the Steel Control Order on January 27. The government is implementing management of major ironmaking factories throughout the country. The purpose is to overcome the many adverse conditions in steel production and ensure the required production quantity. The significance of factory management particularly emphasizes the following three points:</p>
<p>(1) After being managed by the state, the importance of designated factories will be deeply recognized, and cooperation will be given.</p>
<p>(2) Managing factories makes the conscription of labor possible, and at the same time, original labor management can be more thorough, solving the labor problems in ironmaking.</p>
<p>(3) To ensure the thoroughness of planned production, the product formats and sizes must meet the needs in the process of implementing concrete production plans according to the material mobilization plan. After the government manages the factories, the government's needs and production can be completely consistent in terms of type and time.</p>
<p>After the implementation of the management of ironmaking factories, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry dispatches supervisory officials to the managed factories. The relationship between the supervisory officials and the resident staff dispatched by the Control Association is that the resident staff are under the command of the supervisory officials and cooperate with the supervisory officials to guide them. The two become one to carry out the production plan. Last December, the first president of the Iron and Steel Wire Control Association, Mr. Shozaburo Hira-o, and the chairman of the board, Mr. Naoto Kobisawa, resigned. The president of Nittetsu, Mr. Teiji Toyota, was elected as the successor president, and the president of North China Iron &amp; Steel, Mr. Yoshisuke Watanabe, was elected as the successor chairman. President Toyota concurrently holds the position of president of Nittetsu, breaking the original practice of the Control Association president being a full-time position. The Iron and Steel Control Association was established before the implementation of the Important Industries Association, at a time when the transition to steel self-sufficiency for Japan, China, and Manchuria was imminent. To achieve this great goal, the Iron and Steel Control Association must occupy a strong leading position in the steel industry. In the current steel situation in Japan, one ton of iron now is more valuable than ten tons of iron in the future. Therefore, those who are in charge of control must understand the actual situation of control and gradually implement the necessary countermeasures. This is the reason why the position of president of the Iron and Steel Control Association is held concurrently by the president of Nittetsu.</p>
<p>At the beginning of President Toyota's inauguration, regarding the operating policy of the Control Association, the original emphasis on planning was shifted to the principle of prioritizing the practice of production plans. The Planning Department was merged into the Production Department to unify production and planning. At the same time, the future development of the Control Association's function will concentrate its focus on this large Production Department, dedicating its full efforts to practical aspects.

<p>Berlin, 10th (Haito News Agency): There is no war in southern Tunisia. The German forces did not launch a large-scale offensive against the British Eighth Army last Sunday. The German forces attacked the Mareth Line, breaking into positions in the southwestern section of the line. The motive was to disrupt General Montgomery's preparations for the offensive and to test the enemy's deployment. If successful, the Axis forces encountered weak resistance from the enemy at the beginning of the advance. However, after advancing about twenty kilometers, they discovered a strong British position with many artillery pieces. The Axis vanguard reconnoitered the enemy's position and then automatically withdrew to their original defenses with minimal losses. The reports in the British and American newspapers about this contact are quite different from the truth. It is unknown where the claim that the Axis forces suffered heavy losses came from. General Zappalerni has not depleted his forces and still maintains his full strength to fight. The American forces in central Tunisia have entered the area vacated by the Axis forces according to the planned withdrawal. An attempt by the American vanguard to move east was thwarted by the Axis rearguard. The Axis forces in northern Tunisia remain in an active position and have advanced west and southwest of Cape Serrat. The British First Army has suffered considerable losses in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Domei News Agency): The land battle in the Tunisian war zone returned to slumber on Monday. The German forces under General Rommel in southern Tunisia launched a surprise attack on the British Eighth Army on Saturday, inflicting heavy damage before withdrawing behind the Mareth Line. In the coastal area west of Cape Serrat in northern Tunisia, the German forces have again temporarily suspended their land operations. American forces have recently appeared for the first time in the northern district of Tunisia to reinforce the British forces under General Anderson. American forces have also entered the Ousselitia area in central Tunisia to reinforce the British forces. Although the land battle in the north has quieted down, the German air force attacked British targets in the Djebel Aboid area. On Monday, the Axis forces in central Tunisia withdrew from the area they had occupied in mid-February. The advancing American vanguard made contact near the Pichon area. These American units have been repelled. There have been no new developments since the German forces in southern Tunisia attacked the British Eighth Army on Saturday.

<h3 id="e26">Anti-Axis Camp Discusses Post-War World Issues; Different Dreams, Divergent War Aims <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 10th (Central News Agency): Since the Soviet Union launched its winter offensive, the countries of the anti-Axis camp have regarded the issue of post-war world management as an urgent task and have engaged in discussions. Although US Vice President Wallace did not explicitly express the issue of world management in his speech on the 8th, focusing on post-war discussions, in reality, as a result of the conflicting positions and war aims of the anti-Axis camp, they have had to raise this issue in order to continue the war. At the beginning of this World War, the anti-Axis camp only adopted a defensive posture and had no need to establish war aims. Subsequently, with the development of the war situation, they adopted the Atlantic Charter of August 1941 as their guiding principle, with the war aims of protecting exiled countries and restoring pre-war freedoms. However, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the US government, with its ambitions of new imperialism, attempted to inherit the legacy of Britain. At the same time, the Soviet government, having single-handedly shouldered the heavy responsibility of the war, declared its intention to dominate Eastern Europe in the future. This fully exposes the ugly face and the different dreams within the anti-Axis camp. The London correspondent of the Aftonbladet on the 8th commented on the Polish government-in-exile's request to restore lost territories, saying, "The Soviet government's strong attitude is sufficient to indicate its determination to pursue its own policies in the future. British political circles are very concerned about this. This issue has caused anxiety in both the government and the opposition in Britain." However, the disputes among the anti-Axis camp are not limited to this and are very numerous. The most important are: (1) The US government, citing the implementation of aid under the Lend-Lease Act as the main reason, openly used the excuse that Britain's policy of governing India and other colonies violated the Atlantic Charter to seize British territories in West Asia and Africa. At the same time, it attempted to seize British islands and military bases in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans under the pretext of transferring old destroyers. Regarding this US ambition, the British Ambassador to the US, Halifax, recently published an article in an American magazine, strongly arguing that Britain had made substantial counter-payments for US aid under the Lend-Lease Act. The British Colonial Secretary, Stanley, also strongly attacked the US government's aggressive policies in a speech at Oxford University. (2) The Soviet Union, based on its military and ethnic considerations, spied on Eastern European countries and expressed strong opposition to the demands of the Polish government-in-exile and other countries to return their original territories. Currently, the arguments between the Soviet Union and Poland regarding the Ukrainian region and other aspects are brewing intensely in secret. US Undersecretary of State Welles and the New Zealand Minister to the US, Nash, both advocate for an immediate review of post-war political and economic issues and the establishment of a supreme conference of anti-Axis countries to manage the post-war world. Although this is only a fantasy that ignores the current state of the war, it can be seen as their urgent request to carry out the entire war, given the reality of the anti-Axis camp. The London Economic Weekly magazine, published on the 5th, commented on the above issues, saying, "The British government has always taken the initiative in dealing with the political issues of the anti-Axis camp, but in the future, it will have a special mission. Regarding the dispute between the Soviet Union and Poland, it should warn them not to be taken advantage of by the Axis powers." It is undeniable that the Axis camp is a group of countries with different political systems, including the extremely left-leaning and the extremely right-leaning, as well as all other political colors. Because the war aims are also different, this is the reason why the anti-Axis camp is currently in a crisis of division. Even if they can hold a conference of anti-Axis countries as President Roosevelt recently mentioned, it is doubtful whether they can form a completely unified front. It is evident that the different dreams of the anti-Axis camp have been completely exposed.</p>

<p>Geneva, 10th (German News Agency): According to the "Journal de Genève," which obtained information from Calcutta, there is no hope of releasing Gandhi and other parliamentary party members in the coming months.

<h3 id="e36">Citywide Distribution of Rationed Sugar Begins Today. Adjustment of Sugar Distribution Agencies in the City. Category A Retailers Must Open for Business Promptly Every Day. <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office, with the approval of the military authorities, has prepared for the citywide distribution of rationed sugar. The sugar purchase permits for the two concessions have been issued by the Public Works Department and the French Municipal Council respectively. The districts of Nanshi, Zhabei, Huxi, the city center, and Pudong have also been issued permits by the Municipal Grain Management Bureau when the sixth-term household rice was sold to each household. The style is similar to the rice purchase permit, and purchases are made at designated Category A sugar retail stores with the permit. The designated store numbers and addresses are printed on the back of the sugar purchase permit. The various methods, quantities, and prices have been announced by the Cooperative Business Office, and have also been published in various newspapers. Citizens must follow the procedures to purchase sugar from today until the end of this month. During this stipulated period, all Category A sugar retail stores must open for business every day and must not use the sugar purchase as an excuse to sell other goods. The amount must be absolutely accurate and there must be no adulteration. Violators will be severely punished.</p>
<p>City Center Adjustment: Supply Agencies</p>
<p>In order to alleviate the threat to the sugar supply in the city center, the Municipal Grain Management Bureau has prepared for the completion of the household sugar rationing. All household sugar rationing permits have been printed and stamped by the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office. In recent days, the Bureau has distributed the permits to households in Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, and the city center, based on the current population of each district. In the Huxi district, sugar permits also began to be distributed yesterday. It is stipulated that each person will be rationed half a catty of sugar per month, priced at 2.35 yuan in Central Reserve Notes. The sale of sugar will be implemented simultaneously with the two concessions from today (the 11th) to the end of this month and will be widely distributed. From April onwards, the sugar supply agencies in the city center will be completely adjusted by the Grain Management Bureau.</p>
<p>Retail Profits: Equally Distributed</p>
<p>In order to strictly manage the Category A retailers who sell household rationed sugar, the Cooperative Business Office has completed the re-registration of all retailers. The breakdown is as follows: (1) 138 in the Public Concession, (2) 111 in the French Concession, (3) 61 in Nanshi, (4) 65 in Huxi, (5) 65 in Zhabei, (6) Pudong and the city center are entrusted to the Grain Management Bureau for distribution. After review and verification, all unqualified households have been canceled, and qualified ones have been merged. However, the legitimate profits that retailers should receive will be distributed equally among the merged stores, and the Cooperative Business Office will issue registration numbers for them to hang up for identification.</p>
<p>Business Needs: Application Dates</p>
<p>All retailers selling household rationed sugar must strictly abide by the various rules promulgated by the authorities: (1) Sugar must be sold based on the price announced by the Cooperative Business Office, and there must be no unauthorized price increases. (2) There must be no deduction of quantity or adulteration. If there is a violation of the above regulations, citizens are allowed to report to the Cooperative Business Office or the nearest police station for investigation. For the sugar needed for various business purposes after the implementation of household rationing, the Cooperative Business Office will provide special allocations, but only to those who have been approved for registration. The application period is from the 23rd to the 25th of each month. After review and approval, sugar permits will be issued for payment and pickup.</p>
<p>Main Food Retail Rules</p>
<p>In order to maintain the supply of major foodstuffs, the authorities of the two concessions have been rationing rice and flour since July 7th of last year. Miscellaneous grains, cooking oil, and sugar will also be sold on a rationed basis. The respective retail stores have been designated, and the required purchase permits have been issued by the permit-issuing offices. The sale of sugar has been scheduled to start today. However, the retail stores must comply with the regulations in buying and selling, and must not intentionally violate them, otherwise they will be severely punished according to regulations.</p>
<p>Sold in Stages According to Combined Tickets</p>
<p>A Shanghai News Agency reporter learned yesterday that all retail stores must comply with the regulations in buying and selling: (1) Miscellaneous grains, cooking oil, and sugar can only be sold to those who present a combined purchase ticket issued by the Public Concession or the French Concession, and the quantity is limited to what is stated on the combined ticket submitted by the purchaser. (2) Each retail store must only sell if the purchase permit has the store's registration number. (3) In the first phase, retailers can only sell to those with the first combined ticket, and so on for the rest.</p>

<p>(4) Each combined ticket can only be used in the period indicated by the number on the ticket. If a combined ticket is not used within the period, it will be considered invalid. (5) Each retailer must submit a report of the previous period's sales to the relevant parties on the last day of each period. This report must be submitted together with the returned combined tickets.

<p>Violations of Regulations Will Be Strictly Investigated</p>

<h3 id="e42">Japanese Embassy Secretary Mr. Manabe Talks <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Embassy Office in Shanghai held its routine meeting with the Shanghai Chinese Journalists' Association at the Hua Mao Building on the eighth floor at 3:00 pm yesterday (10th). More than ten reporters from various newspapers attended. Mr. Manabe, the secretary of the embassy, and Deputy Consul Fukuma attended on behalf of the embassy. Mr. Manabe explained the reasons for the strength of Germany's wartime power.</p>
<p>Long Stay in Germany</p>
<p>Mr. Manabe, the secretary of the Japanese Embassy, ​​served as a Japanese language professor at Leipzig University in Germany from 1933 to 1936 during the reign of German leader Hitler. He has a good understanding of the situation in Germany, especially the economic situation. Mr. Manabe translated German leader Hitler's book "Mein Kampf", which was admired by the Japanese government and the public. Yesterday, Mr. Manabe explained in detail the reasons for the strength of Germany's wartime power, stating that Germany had already prepared for the wartime economy before this European war. Since it broke out in May 1939, it has been victorious every year and invincible in every attack. Before the war, in 1933, it engaged in agricultural production, and the following year it controlled food and no longer relied on foreign supplies, but was able to supply itself. In 1935, it implemented price controls, and in 1936, it began a rationing system. By 1938, its foreign trade exports had reached the highest level. Then the Second European War broke out in 1939.</p>
<p>German Economy</p>
<p>When the European war first started, Britain's observation of Germany was completely wrong. It thought that it could cause Germany to collapse by economically blockading it. In the early days of the European war, it assumed the organization of companies and attempted to buy up food and various raw materials in Southeast Europe as a strategy to control the German economy, but it had no effect in reality. Germany's occupation of Poland, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Greece, etc. is enough to use various huge and rich materials. The coal reserves are abundant, and there is the output of Ninglizia. As for the iron ore problem, at the beginning of the war, there were iron ore mines in France and Poland, and then iron ore mines in Ukraine, Sweden, etc. were captured, and the complete iron-making factories of Poland, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France were occupied. As a result, Germany's iron and steel production is comparable to that of the United States. The production of aluminum and manganese itself is quite high, and copper is also self-sufficient. The supply has also been secured in healthy Norway and Yugoslavia. Germany also has abundant zinc reserves. As for Germany's petroleum problem, Romania can produce 7 million tons annually, Galicia produces 1 million tons annually, and Germany itself can produce 500,000 tons annually. There are also three countries, France, Italy and Estonia, which use scientific methods to extract oil from coal.</p>
<p>Total Mobilization Order</p>
<p>Germany has now announced a national mobilization order to vigorously produce military materials. Ordinary factories are ordered to stop production in order to concentrate all efforts on this item. Men from the age of sixteen to sixty-five and women from the age of seventeen to forty-five are all ordered to mobilize. The remaining unimportant shops and food sales are ordered to stop, and employees are transferred to military factories to serve. Finally, Secretary Manabe also said that after the implementation of the total mobilization order, employees of public utilities such as the Berlin subway, street cars, and buses have all been demobilized and entered military service or work in military factories, and women serve as substitutes. This method has already been implemented in Britain and the United States, but in Germany it is only starting with this total mobilization, and 7 million workers from the occupied areas have gone to Germany to work for the Germans, so there is no panic about Germany's manpower resources. People who destroy war materials and control are subject to severe punishment.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Thoroughly Improve the Lives of Civil Servants <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yongding</p>
<p>The four characters of "incorruptible politics" have been proposed by many knowledgeable people concerned about the country and its future since the Republic of China. However, until now, we still cannot achieve the elimination of malpractices and maintain a clean and honest government, nor can we achieve complete integrity. What is the reason for this? After my research, it is ultimately due to the following two main factors:</p>
<p>(1) The country has established laws, but they have not been thoroughly implemented.</p>
<p>(2) The lifestyle habits of the general public have not been reasonably adjusted and improved.</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, I believe that it is naturally easier to implement during peacetime, and there is no problem. However, in the current extraordinary period of war, there are still considerations to be made. Because of low salaries and high living costs, some civil servants take risks and do things they shouldn't, but it is truly out of necessity to survive, accounting for half of them. As recently reported, Pan Da, the director of the Shanghai West Police Bureau, encouraged the police to be honest and self-respecting, saying: "Recently, I heard that some police officers are secretly complaining, saying that we police officers receive a monthly salary of ninety-three yuan. If you are single, you can barely get by, but if you have a family, it is very difficult to maintain a living." Indeed, it is really impossible to expect a police officer who earns ninety-three yuan a month to remain incorruptible. No wonder a civil servant surnamed Sun in a certain Hangzhou agency hanged himself because he could not bear the pressure of life. (See the Xin Shen Bao Evening News of the 6th of this month for details.) Guanzi said it well: "Only when clothing and food are sufficient can people know honor and disgrace; only when the granary is full can people know etiquette." Although this is the case, the government is currently in a time of war, and all civil servants should share the difficulties together and use a spirit of hard work to overcome this difficulty.</p>
<p>However, I believe that suicide is the worst and most cowardly option. I sincerely implore everyone with twelve thousand points of sincerity that this kind of thinking should never exist. We must know that there is always a way out. Anyone with a clear mind and a strong physique will not starve to death. Zeng Wenzheng said, "In this chaotic world, even great wealth and high status cannot be relied upon. Only diligence and thrift can last. Although the body is weak, if it can be tempered by wind and frost, it will naturally strengthen bones and broaden knowledge." Therefore, we must be determined that the worse the environment and the more difficult the life, the more we should fight against this bad environment. Only in this way can we be worthy of being a person. Now, please remember the following two optimistic mountain songs, which are "Days are hard to get through, days are hard to get through, days are hard to get through, days pass by day by day. People are hard to be, people are hard to be, the harder people are to be, the more they should be."</p>
<p>In the editorial of the Shen Bao on the 3rd of this month, there is an article about improving the lives of civil servants, which can truly be called a good remedy that is practical and aims to save the country. The general idea is: "The salaries of all civil servants are insufficient to maintain their minimum living standards. The best can only make ends meet, and it is difficult to support a family. For those in the middle and lower ranks, even their own lives cannot be maintained, let alone supporting their families and educating their children. Material life is already difficult, and there is no spiritual comfort. Even if one is as virtuous as Yan Hui, one would probably have to change one's enjoyment. Therefore, most people hold the mentality of 'five-day magistrate of the capital' and no longer focus on government affairs. I hope that the government will immediately improve their treatment, re-determine the salary and allowance amounts for civil servants at all levels, and use the price index of various places as the standard, so that at least they can all support their families and educate their children. At the same time, in terms of spirit, enhance their self-esteem, make them feel the importance of the country's entrustment, and encourage everyone to work hard and dedicate themselves to public service." It also said: "As long as they are honest and dedicated to public service, they should be specially rewarded and publicly promoted as model civil servants. At the same time, in terms of material things, ensure that they have enough to live on. This is our principle of advocating improving and guaranteeing the lives of civil servants." The author believes that if our government can adopt the above-mentioned methods and gradually improve them in a comprehensive plan within the scope of the country's financial resources, I believe that in the near future, our country will definitely be able to achieve a clean and honest government and a vibrant phenomenon. Therefore, to thoroughly promote incorruptible politics, on the one hand, we must govern by law, and on the other hand, we must consider the circumstances, so that their treatment is improved, their lives are stable, and they know how to repay the country.</p>
<p>Speaking of the second point, it is easy to promote, because if a person's life is too wasteful and absurd, even earning a thousand gold a day is not enough to squander. Moreover, at a time when everything is expensive, if one does not strictly control various expenses, one will inevitably end up in a situation where income does not meet expenditure, and thus have to use one's power and dare to act illegally. This is also an inevitable trend. Especially now that our government is promoting the New Movement, we want to revitalize politics, military affairs, education, and everything else. It seems necessary to reasonably adjust and improve the lifestyle habits of the general public (civil servants are also the public). The ancients said: "Customs change people, even the virtuous cannot avoid it." However, there are many aspects of our people's lifestyle habits that are really unreasonable. Government civil servants are accustomed to following the old ways because of their insecure lives and are unwilling to be loyal to the country and serve the people. The people in society are accustomed to pleasure, deceiving each other. Young people are depraved and indulgent, and adults are corrupt and mediocre. The rich are extravagant and frivolous, while the poor are despicable and opportunistic, hoarding and speculating, hoping to make a fortune in times of crisis. As for the general vulgar farmers, because they have less knowledge, they only know how to be superstitious and wait for fate, which is even more unnecessary to talk about. I ask, if everyone in the country only knows how to seek comfort and good fortune, how can the country not be weak and how can society be stable? Therefore, to multiply the lives of our people, protect the stability of our society, and develop the livelihoods of our people, we must quickly sweep away all the above-mentioned bad habits and replace them with reasonable and normal lives. However, in our country's tradition, we either don't talk about integrity, or we must start with government officials, because officials can set an example and guide the people, then the people will naturally be convinced and follow suit. As I write this, I suddenly remembered something that made me feel the most heartbroken and ashamed, that is, several years ago, I remember that Mr. Ozawa Fumio, a professor at the East Asia Dobun Hospital, once published an article in a Japanese newspaper warning the Japanese people not to be seduced by the Chinese, saying: "The reason why the Chinese are prosperous is due to the corrupt politics of the Chinese dynasties. When Japanese people come to China, those who are not determined are mostly seduced by the Chinese and become accustomed to corruption." (The meaning of his article is roughly as I remember it.) Indeed, the corrupt state of Chinese politics in the past was an undeniable fact, which led to the loss of people's faith and the contempt of the international community. This led to a phenomenon of decline and stagnation. Therefore, to make a country prosperous, we must achieve political clarity and social order, so that people in the country will not think of chaos. Even people from foreign countries will have a sense of admiration. Mencius said: "People must insult themselves, then others will insult them; families must kill themselves, then others will destroy them; countries must attack themselves, then others will attack them." This also explains that a person, a family, or a country must work hard to prosper.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Gongbo, a senior member of the party and state, is one of the most vigorous advocates of incorruptible politics. I remember that after the national government returned to Nanjing, he published an essay entitled: "Incorruptible Politics is the Basic Condition for Peaceful Nation-Building." The article said: "Since the incident, many people in Chongqing have made a lot of money from the national crisis in the name of unified control. People are heartbroken when they talk about these unfilial officials and unfilial merchants. But we can't bear to see the people in Chongqing making money from the national crisis, so how can we bear to stand idly by and watch the people under the rule of the National Government making money from peace? I can't help but loudly call on those who have a heart and ambition to pay attention." In addition, Mr. Zhao Zunyue, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government, also published a very meaningful article in the Shanghai Bi-Monthly this year on New Year's Day. He said: "Most people in Shanghai, the strong often despise the law, and lightly talk about public morality. The second is to only seek personal enjoyment, without paying attention to the stability of the whole. The third is to only seek self-interest, but to make more money. The poison of utilitarianism is deeply rooted in people's hearts. All of this, in a small way, is not in line with the current trend and only leads to pain. In a large way, the harm to individuals is small, but the harm to the country is great." After reading the above two paragraphs from Mr. Chen and Mr. Zhao, I think any ambitious Chinese youth will have a great feeling!</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that in order to make domestic politics clean and honest, and to put all economic, construction, military, and education affairs on track, it is essential to request the government to improve the treatment of civil servants at all levels as much as possible within the scope of the country's financial resources, and to reasonably adjust the lifestyle habits of civil servants. However, to improve the reasonable lives of civil servants, it is even more essential to quickly implement a thrift campaign, because "thrift" is the opposite of "corruption." Those who cannot value thrift cannot be asked to remain incorruptible. The ancients said: "Diligence can make up for clumsiness, and thrift can support integrity." For example, a person who is extremely stupid by nature does not want to find a way to make up for it with diligence. Or a poor person who is accustomed to luxury does not want to use thrift to correct it. In the end, they will definitely end up being more stupid and poorer. China's economic situation now is like a poor person who is accustomed to luxury. On the one hand, they are crying from hunger and cold, and they don't even have food to eat. On the other hand, the poor still desperately want to live their luxurious dreams. It can be said that on the one hand, they are living extravagantly, and on the other hand, they are suffering from hunger and cold. If we don't find a way to save this deformed phenomenon, I think our entire nation's inferior traits will develop to an unimaginable level. "Thrift" was originally our inherent Chinese virtue, but since the material enjoyment of the British and Americans and the lavish lifestyle of spending money like water were brought to China along with the forces of aggression, this morality has gradually disappeared and become non-existent. Now I pick up this excellent virtue of "thrift" that no one wants and has been abandoned by society for a long time and advocate it. Although some people will say that my thinking is outdated, some people will sympathize with my views. Not only sympathize, but also encourage and urge me with letters and telegrams, and ask me to quickly establish a permanent thrift organization. However, I have always tirelessly practiced and cherished it. Now, when the British and Americans have not yet been defeated and the Greater East Asia War has not yet been completed, even if we try our best to save, I am afraid it will be difficult to survive. If we don't save, the future life will be even more unimaginable. The urgency of the need for a thrift campaign in the current situation is indeed the same for everyone. However, the first thing in a thrift campaign is to emphasize practice. It is definitely not just empty talk. We should start with ourselves and then seek it from others. We should start with what is possible and does not take time or money, and then implement it in other aspects. Only in this way can we not lose the true meaning of advocating thrift. The Great Learning says: "Cultivate oneself and then regulate the family, regulate the family and then govern the country, govern the country and then pacify the world." This is the meaning.</p>

<p>The Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance previously required merchants dealing in the six special tax goods of sugar, cosmetics, tung oil, tea, bristles, and poultry feathers to apply for registration in accordance with the regulations. They had set a deadline for collecting forms and applying for registration at No. 6 Bund, the office of the Taxation Department. Later, considering that there were still a few merchants who had not followed the procedure after the deadline, an extension was granted until the 15th of this month as a gesture of consideration. Now that the extension period is only a few days away, it is about to expire and will not be extended again. All merchants who have not yet completed the registration procedures should fill out the form and register within the deadline, otherwise, if the department finds out after the deadline, they will be severely investigated and punished.</p>

<p>— Qinglian</p>
<p>(9) Cultural Life</p>
<p>The Burmese culture, symbolized by the "Seven-Story Pagoda," began to flourish in 1044 AD when King Anawrahta, the first great man among the Burmese emperors, established his capital in Pagan, introduced Buddhist civilization, and encouraged cultural and artistic achievements. The temples built at that time, as well as the textiles and lacquerware handicrafts in the Pagan area, are all famous relics that express Burmese culture. After the demise of the Pagan Dynasty, the history of the Tungu and Mandalay Dynasties underwent changes, but the spirit of maintaining the magnificent vitality of Pagan culture, who says it has not been passed down in the blood of every Burmese today?</p>
<p>As the forces of England and France gradually expanded eastward, Burma eventually became a colonial battlefield. In 1828, England declared war on Burma on a trivial pretext and occupied Yangon, Ma Tongban, Dat Phoi, Bigu, and other places. After the Second War in 1855 and the Third War in 1885, Burma was completely lost, and from then on, the dark age of Burma began. The Anglo-American spirit of the Burmese who had once shocked the East by conquering Assam, Manipur, and Siam was gradually diminished under the cunning appeasement policy of the British, and they indulged in an atmosphere of laziness and ease. However, this was only the case for some members of the Burmese upper class. As mentioned above, most Burmese people continuously carried out anti-British independence movements and national cultural movements, which sprouted and grew in the vast middle and lower classes, becoming a powerful mainstream in the national liberation movement! The unceasing flow of revolutionary blood is irrigating the free flower of Burmese national culture.</p>
<p>The fundamental policy of Japan towards Burmese culture is to first break the "lazy atmosphere" of the Burmese people, and to set an example for East Asian nations to be diligent, thrifty, loyal, and honest. They reject the British-style pragmatism that has been brewing for fifty years and revive the spirit of Oriental morality. For this purpose, they use all propaganda organs and introduce Japanese culture as the first priority. They establish Japanese language schools in all important cities, towns, and villages, striving to introduce the current situation of Japan, promote the Japanese spirit, and promote Japanese culture.</p>
<p>Religion has a great influence in Burma. For the vast majority of people, the monks and Buddhists, it is certainly not suitable to promote politics, but Japan will never give up its responsibility to guide them. As early as July last year, it called on Burmese monks to organize the "Burmese Buddhist Alliance" and instill in them political common sense about building the New East Asian Order and the tasks that Burmese people should shoulder.</p>
<p>The Japanese authorities also strive to absorb the cultural circles. In August last year, they recruited Burmese cultural figures and established the "Burmese Cultural Alliance" to strive for the import of Japanese culture and art. At the same time, they guide key government officials, newspaper and magazine employees, and organize the "Japanese Cultural Research Institute" to introduce the essence of Japanese culture into the lives of Burmese people.</p>
<p>Burma, famous for "no illiteracy," has been educating primary schools by monks, and there are also several thousand national primary schools. The military government worked hard to open all schools on the anniversary of the outbreak of the war on December 8 last year and selected textbooks to adapt to the new situation.</p>
<p>In order to promote education, in order to implement a training plan for elementary, middle and university education, a strong agency was organized. For the first time on October 25, about 1,000 teachers were gathered in Yangon and taught new educational policies to adapt to the Great East Asia War and the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>Before the war, Burma had two major broadcasting stations, Yangon and Mandalay. After the Japanese army occupied them, they worked hard to repair them. The Yangon broadcasting station started broadcasting on July 15, making planned broadcasts to the country, especially to India.</p>
<p>In terms of newspapers and magazines, before the war, there were newspapers and magazines everywhere from the capital Yangon to Mandalay, all of which were full of liberal views. After the Great East Asia War developed to Burma, they were successively suspended. Now there are two Burmese newspapers, three Indian newspapers, and one Chinese newspaper in Yangon, all under the guidance of the Japanese military intelligence department, launching a public opinion front to build a new Burma. The two Burmese newspapers are preparing to merge recently in accordance with Japanese policies.</p>
<p>In Myanmar today, whether in politics, military affairs, or economy, it is at the forefront of the Great East Asia War. The movements of Myanmar and the national liberation struggle of the Burmese people will undoubtedly be the focus of attention around the world. Myanmar will not disappoint the expectations of the East Asian nations and the oppressed nations of the world. (The End)</p>

<p>The Ministry of Interior stated that when Chinese and Western medical practitioners apply for ministry certificates, if the qualification documents were lost due to accidents and could not be submitted for certification, two variable certification methods were previously formulated to remedy the situation. Now, the ministry believes that since the return to the capital, it has been three years and all politics have entered the right track. The aforementioned variable measures are no longer applicable. It was ordered to be abolished on March 1 to prevent abuses. The municipal government has approved the consultation order and instructed the Health Bureau to comply.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Yarn Industry Speculation: Authorities Advocate Severe Punishment, Appeal Against Commutation of Imprisonment to Fines – Even Imprisonment Would Be Just Deserved <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council, determined to crack down on speculative activities, had issued repeated orders and strict prohibitions. However, it was later discovered that Lianzhong Yarn Shop, Fengda Yarn Shop, Tianyuan Yarn Shop, Fengji Yarn Shop, Yuhua Yarn Shop, Hesheng Yarn Shop, Hu Heji Proof Shop, etc., did not comply with the council's orders and continued to engage in speculation. Therefore, the council, based on the crime of gambling, filed a lawsuit with the Special First Court against the responsible persons of each shop, including Wang Jiazhi, Hu Henian, Wang Xiwen, Chen Shanfen, Yuan Zongzhou, Zhang Yunkang, Zheng Zhongren, Luo Jingxian, Sun Zhenlin, Xia Wenda, and Yan Zhaotang.</p>
<p>Sentences of Imprisonment and Fines Imposed</p>
<p>After investigation and trial, Wang Jiazhi and Hu Henian were each sentenced to six months imprisonment and fined 1,500 yuan. Wang Xiwen and Chen Shanfen were each sentenced to five months imprisonment and fined 1,200 yuan. Yuan Zongzhou, Zhang Yunkang, Zheng Zhongren, and Luo Jingxian were each sentenced to four months imprisonment and fined 1,000 yuan. Sun Zhenlin, Xia Wenda, and Yan Zhaotang were each sentenced to two months imprisonment and fined 800 yuan. If the execution of the imprisonment proved difficult, it would be commuted to a fine at the rate of three yuan per day. After the judgment, except for Wang Jiazhi, Sun Zhenlin, Zheng Zhongren, and Luo Jingxian, who expressed dissatisfaction and filed an appeal, the remaining judgments were final and executed according to law.</p>
<p>Commutation Approved, Authorities Appeal</p>
<p>The defendants all submitted statements stating their difficulties, requesting that the imprisonment be commuted to fines. The court approved these requests. However, the legal department of the Shanghai Municipal Council argued that the defendants' involvement in speculative activities had a significant and profound impact on the people's livelihood. The council had repeatedly advised them to stabilize prices, but the defendants only sought profit and turned a deaf ear. If they were not punished with imprisonment, it would be insufficient to deter future offenders. Now, the defendants merely submitted statements claiming difficulties and were immediately granted commutation. It should be known that the defendants' profession is harmful to society, and they have already obtained huge profits. Even if they were imprisoned, their families would not be significantly affected. Therefore, their claims of various difficulties related to family and profession are insufficient to be accepted. The department appealed against the ruling to allow the commutation of imprisonment to fines.</p>
<p>Yarn Industry Leader Answers Inquiries</p>
<p>As for the appeal case of Wang Jiazhi and the other four, the criminal division chief of the Second High Court held a collegiate panel yesterday to hear the case. The court ordered the summoning of Tang Zhiliang, chairman of the Yarn Industry Association, as a witness to inquire about the sale and purchase of yarn and cloth by various yarn shops. Tang replied that according to the association's articles of association, transactions among fellow traders were limited to spot goods. He also answered the court's inquiry about the location of trading among fellow traders after the closure of the exchange, saying that because fellow traders lacked a place to meet after the exchange closed, the association had opened a space for meetings, but the settlement of transactions took place in the shops of each fellow trader. The court then briefly questioned the appellants, ordered the start of arguments, and the lawyer representing the Shanghai Municipal Council advocated for strict investigation. The court then announced the end of the arguments and scheduled a date for the pronouncement of the verdict.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Postal Administration has been making every effort to restore remittances to various places, remittances have been restored to Tunxi, Yixian, Hankou, Jiujiang, and other places. However, the maximum remittance amount is limited to 50 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the restoration of remittances in the commercial area of Zhejiang is still being planned, although efforts are being made to do so. It is understood that the only place in the Zhejiang postal area currently offering remittances is Ningbo in eastern Zhejiang, where each remittance order can be for 100 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes, with a limit of five orders at a time. The neighboring counties of Yuyao, Zhenhai, Cixi, and Fenghua do not offer remittances.</p>

<p>The Chinese Education Morality Society on Tongfu Road has established an orphanage to help orphans who have lost their parents. Due to the high cost of living in Shanghai, the society has surveyed a site of more than 50 mu at the old site of Zhiyuan in Dongyaowan, Wuxi, as the location for the orphanage. Construction and repairs are currently underway, and once completed, the orphanage will begin accepting orphans. The society has also purchased 100 mu of public land, the proceeds of which will be used as operating expenses. However, as it is just starting, funds are urgently needed, and the society appeals for donations from all sectors. The society also recognizes the suffering of the poor and has not yet alleviated it. Therefore, it continues to carry out spring relief work, distribute porridge, and operate mobile soup kitchens, providing relief to more than 1,000 poor people every day. Other charitable acts, such as providing Chinese and Western medical treatment, dispensing medicine, and providing small loans to the poor, are still being actively carried out.</p>

<p>In this city, the cost of living has been rising daily in recent years, leading many poor citizens to become beggars. As a result, beggars are visible everywhere in the city, which is not only related to the appearance of the city but is also truly pitiful.</p>
<p>Providing Simple Handicraft Industry</p>
<p>According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the authorities of the two concessions, recognizing the seriousness of the beggar problem on the streets, are currently working on establishing a vagrant skills training center. The location is planned for Caohejing in the suburbs. The center plans to first provide simple handicrafts, such as straw rope weaving, so that beggars can start producing as soon as they enter the center.</p>
<p>Specifically Accepting Adult Beggars</p>
<p>It is heard that the preparatory work is being planned by the Shanghai Municipal Council, the French Municipal Council, and other relevant authorities, including the reception and management of beggars, which may be handled by the Red Swastika Society. The Shanghai Municipal Council already has a reception center located on Hardoon Road, but currently, it only accepts child beggars and lost children. There is a lack of reception facilities for older beggars. It is expected that after the establishment of the reception center, the number of beggars on the streets of this city will gradually decrease.</p>
<p>Opening of the YMCA Solicitation Campaign</p>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA is purely a social service organization that has a proven track record of undertaking social welfare projects.

Today, the 43rd solicitation campaign was launched at noon on the ninth floor of the YMCA building in the Eight Immortals Bridge. More than 300 guests were present. Sun Ruihuang served as chairman. After the meal, he reported on the opening of the meeting. Yan Huiqing and Lin Kanghou then gave speeches in succession, which were earnest and encouraging. Qu Yaokang gave a reply on behalf of the guests. The meeting adjourned at about 2 p.m. The total target of this solicitation campaign is 300,000 yuan, plus 100,000 yuan in donations, divided into 100 teams, with each team aiming for 3,000 yuan. The first announcement will be held on the 12th, and the closing ceremony will be held on April 2.

<h3 id="e64">Establishing a Decisive Battle System and Strengthening Political Power: New Measures by the North China Political Affairs Commission <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>China's participation in the war is a historical transformation. Taking this opportunity, the relationship between the North China Political Affairs Commission and the National Government will be adjusted and strengthened. At the same time, the North China Political Affairs Commission itself will also work hard to strengthen itself. On this basis, it will promote all policies that adapt to the new Sino-Japanese relationship. Since the National Government's participation in the war, there have been many innovative events between Beijing and Nanjing: the organizational regulations of the North China Political Affairs Commission and various general departments and bureaus have been determined, North China has participated in planning the National Economic Commission and the New Movement Promotion Association, Chairman Wang has assumed the position of honorary chairman of the New People's Society, and the establishment of a unified national war system and the abolition of the five-color flag that replaced the national flag have also been gradually realized. The problem of the Suhuai area has some problems unresolved because it is necessary to adjust general laws. However, all political issues pending between Central China and North China have been resolved, further strengthening the connection between the National Government and the North China Political Affairs Commission.</p>
<p>At the same time, the North China Political Affairs Commission implemented a reorganization, with Zhu Shen succeeding as chairman, refreshing the lineup, reorganizing the wartime system, and strengthening the political power of the Political Affairs Commission. Japan, based on its established national policy, is lending full cooperation to create a China for the Chinese people and achieve the true goal of Sino-Japanese cooperation.</p>
<p>One month after the National Government's participation in the war, Japan implemented the lifting of military management relations for 59 factories on February 8. In order to stabilize the people's livelihood under the National Government's rule, the Japanese army in North China again lifted military management for 54 factories related to people's livelihood, such as cotton cloth, wheat flour, textiles, and electricity. In order to strengthen the National Government's war capabilities after participating in the war and to show the spirit of living and dying together, it implemented the third lifting of military management relations for all factories under military management, clearly expressing the principle of respecting the National Government's sovereignty. On February 9, 749 new enemy properties related to the Greater East Asia War were transferred to the Chinese side, and all the enormous rights and interests of enemy countries such as Britain and the United States in North China were also transferred to the Chinese side.</p>
<p>The special agencies established after the incident to handle general affairs between China and Japan transferred matters related to Japanese residents and the movement of materials to the Consulate General for handling from March 1. At the same time, it was decided that all matters involving Chinese administration would also be transferred to the Chinese side for management. In the future, the political, economic, and cultural aspects of the provinces and counties will be solely responsible for approval and progress by the Chinese side.</p>
<p>Another major change is that the maintenance of public order, which has always been the responsibility of the Japanese army, will also be handed over to the Chinese side. In this way, the Japanese army can concentrate on combat, and the police force can support the construction of the new China from the sidelines. This measure is closely related to strengthening the Chinese side's national defense system and is of great importance.</p>
<p>After the implementation of the new policy, the problem of the nature of the New People's Society has undergone an epoch-making transformation. The New People's Society was established after the China Incident and is a popular organization that practices Sino-Japanese cooperation. In addition to the Japanese vice chairman, there are many Japanese employees participating in the work. Since Chairman Ando Kisaburo resigned, the supreme advisor system has been adopted to promote work, spare no effort, and contribute greatly to the construction of North China. However, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, many people believed that in order to adapt to the new situation and accelerate the society's affairs, it was necessary to further clarify the nature of the New People's Society. However, some people disagreed with this proposal, arguing that the original nature should be maintained. Although there were different opinions within the society, in principle, they were all for the good of the overall development.</p>
<p>Later, the military department gave a clear definition, eliminating the outside world's doubts about the nature of the New People's Society, which has a great contribution to future work. In order to show that it is a New People's Society that is truly Chinese, about 2,000 Japanese employees have mostly withdrawn, leaving only a few in the position of advisors or technical guidance. The responsibility for the society's affairs has been very clearly demonstrated in fact.</p>
<p>After the policy shift in North China, various policies have been implemented successively. In addition, the most important part after the abolition of extraterritoriality is the economic adjustment, and the method is currently being studied. After Japan's shift in policy towards China, all matters concerning the construction of a new China will be entirely decided and carried out by the Chinese side, establishing the foundation of the political power of the North China Political Affairs Commission. How the Chinese side will concretely promote Sino-Japanese cooperation in various policies in the future is what must be done earnestly. The recent reorganization was also for this purpose.</p>
<p>Under this new situation, Chairman Zhu Shen, who resolutely took office with heavy responsibility, said in his inaugural declaration:</p>
<p>"The most important issue at present is the development of industry, and the food problem is even more urgent. We will take full responsibility for handling the price problem, the transportation problem, and various other problems, and hope that our ally Japan will provide more assistance." The above words show the premise of strengthening political power.</p>
<p>A certain person who is familiar with Japan criticized this policy shift as being very clever. He compared the current state of Sino-Japanese relations to a patient with severe chills and fever, saying:</p>
<p>"For example, with chills and fever of 39 degrees, this measure has only the effect of reducing the chills and fever by one degree. But holding the normal temperature of 38 degrees, in order to create a close Sino-Japanese friendly relationship like after the Russo-Japanese War, the first thing is to get rid of stable people's livelihood, that is, to implement the Mahayana policy using the Hinayana. It is most important." The above analogy is probably the general view of the Chinese side on the policy shift. Because the most important issue in North China now is to solve the price and food problems. The cost of living is rising, prices are soaring, and some speculative behavior is also one of the reasons for fueling the rising wind.</p>
<p>The reason why prices are rising so much is, of course, speculative psychology and hoarding. It not only stimulates the soaring of food prices, but also hinders the smooth flow of general materials. For this trend, China and Japan are working together from the aspects of materials and circulation of currency to properly prepare measures. For this reason, the North China Political Affairs Commission specially reorganized the Price Adjustment Committee and the Materials Processing Committee, and newly established the North China Materials and Price Processing Committee, attaching the Food Administration Bureau and the Materials Balance Fund Operation Committee here to seek unified processing of materials and prices.</p>
<p>In the current decisive battle period, in order to overcome difficulties, promote the construction of North China, and achieve the mission of meeting the needs of the public, it is necessary to see the results of the conversion policy. There are still many thorns ahead. The biggest mission of North China in the war period is to maintain public order and increase the production of important resources. Contributing to enhancing the combat power to destroy Britain and the United States in the position of a belligerent, Chairman Zhu said at the beginning of his inauguration that China and Japan should cooperate to exert comprehensive combat power, showing the determination to deal with the serious situation. In the future, it is necessary to make the Chinese people understand the national consciousness in wartime, use resolute determination and practical strength to overcome these difficulties, exert the highest political power of the North China Political Affairs Commission, promote all policies, and adhere to the meaning of Sino-Japanese living and dying together to the end.

<h3 id="e68">After the Severing of Ocean Trade, Argentina Will Regulate Economic Institutions <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Argentina has been little affected by the war amidst global turmoil, but recently its agricultural and industrial sectors have inevitably been affected by the waves. Since the United States announced that it would no longer send ships to Argentina, there was no ship entering or leaving the port of Buenos Aires for a day and night, which is unprecedented in a century. It is understood that Argentina has always been a supplier of raw materials to various warring countries, so it has uniquely enjoyed wartime prosperity, especially the goods shipped to the United Kingdom. The goods shipped to the United Kingdom are mainly meat, wheat, and fur. Before the outbreak of the European War, Argentina's meat exports were about 450,000 tons, and no less than 6 million cattle were slaughtered each year, and the wheat shipped to the United Kingdom also reached 6 million pounds per year. There is no doubt that the United Kingdom wants to maintain trade relations with Argentina. However, Argentina's goods shipped to the United Kingdom are mostly bulky items, requiring large tonnage, and there are submarines lurking in the Atlantic Ocean from time to time, so British-Argentine trade is greatly affected. The economic relationship between the United States and Argentina is not as important as the relationship between the United Kingdom and Argentina. Although the goods that the United States ships to Argentina rank second in Argentina's imports, the United States purchases very limited goods from Argentina, far below those of various European countries. This is because the agricultural products of the United States are mostly the same as those of Argentina. The economic relationship between Argentina and the United States was not very important in the past, but in recent years, due to neutral relations, it has also gained some benefits until recently, after the severing of ocean trade, it had to adjust its domestic economic institutions to adapt to the new situation. The Argentine government, in view of the fact that American fuel oil cannot be imported, is trying its best to develop the oil fields in the Keringto Rolivaldavia region. Last year, the oil production in the region was 15 million barrels, but it is still not enough for domestic consumption, so it was decided to refine linseed oil to replace it. It happened that linseed has been unable to be exported in recent years, so refining it into oil can be regarded as waste utilization. In addition, an agreement has recently been established with Bolivia, stipulating that Argentina will exchange wheat for Bolivian oil, and it is currently conducting business negotiations with Brazil, hoping to import cotton from Brazil to replace American cotton. Not only that, after the Argentine government nationalized its merchant ships, it is actively engaged in shipbuilding to develop ocean transportation. President Castillio intends to expand industry to achieve self-sufficiency, but the machinery depends on the supply from the United Kingdom and Germany. Recently, due to the interruption of sources, its construction plan will inevitably be affected to some extent. In short, due to the impact of the war, Argentina's overseas trade has plummeted, so it has to conduct negotiations with South American countries, especially neighboring countries, in order to exchange what they have for what they need and promote economic development.

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e69">Commentary on Speculative Capital <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the China Intelligence Department published an article reviewing the outlet of speculative capital in Shanghai, which roughly stated, "It goes without saying that speculative capital is rampant in this city. Today, with the increasing strengthening of control, where will speculative capital seek an outlet, which is worth studying. Here are the main points: (1) Important daily necessities such as food and clothing are mostly materials with fixed public prices. Funds invested in this area will inevitably flow to the non-controlled sector in the future. (2) The prices of Chinese stocks are rising daily due to the rising prices of goods stored in various factories and the improvement of machinery and equipment evaluations. Currently, a large amount of capital is flowing into the stock market. (3) Land and buildings are the safest investment targets. Although rents are restricted, buying and selling is very free. After the removal of enemy nationality, real estate transactions will inevitably be more prosperous than before. Therefore, trust companies whose main business is buying and selling real estate have recently seen a significant increase. (4) Today, the investment targets in Shanghai are not as wide as before. In view of this situation, more funds will flow to the inland in the future."</p>
<p>This passage is indeed worthy of review and is a point worthy of attention by current entrepreneurs. First, controlled products have publicly determined prices, and the rationing system is gradually being implemented, so it is certainly impossible to operate in the future. Even if you want to operate the buying and selling of materials, you have to focus your sights on the non-controlled sector. Second, Chinese factories are increasing in value in a chain reaction with rising house, property, machinery, raw materials, and assets, and their asset value is increasing, which is an inevitable fact. Therefore, the value of Chinese stocks is increasing accordingly, which is also an internal fact of Qiao Li. If the factory is officially registered in accordance with laws and regulations and its operation is rationalized, then the increase in its price is also an appropriate result. It is hoped that each stock company will organize a formal market, operate normal transactions, and legal transactions, and all actions should be subject to the trade association, then society may not be able to use this transaction to help the progress of industry. As it is a legitimate business, it has legitimate protection. Third, real estate is the biggest outlet for investment. In the past, real estate operators were too adventurous, or could not be universal, and were manipulated by a few real estate developers. If legitimate business companies or trust companies come forward to preside over in the future, then land and its buildings were the safest investment target. It is indeed a major destination for speculative capital. Fourth, it is the operation of inland rural undertakings. All small-scale industries, handicrafts, and rural by-products can be invested in and managed, so that in addition to self-sufficiency, the rural areas can also export local products to other ports in exchange for daily necessities. If this is the case, then after the funds flow into the inland, they will still have to return to the city. These are all the best ways to use speculative capital and are worthy of our advocacy.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 10th, Central News Agency) The Joint Reserve Bank of China in North China has reached its fifth anniversary. On this anniversary, Minister Zhou of the National Government's Ministry of Finance delivered a special speech, expressing gratitude and expectations regarding the government's re-signing of the Joint Reserve Bank loan agreement with allied banking groups. His speech is as follows: "Looking back, the Joint Reserve Bank of China has now been in operation for five years. Its business has grown daily, and its credit has become increasingly apparent. The banknotes it issues are trusted by the general public. This is due to the sound organization and dedicated service of the bank, and the various forms of assistance from allied nations have also been a major factor in its development. For the sake of economic recovery, our government especially hopes that the bank will serve as an important financial center in the North. During this period of the Greater East Asia War, the bank's position in the Northern financial sector is becoming increasingly important. The views held by the allied nations are exactly the same as those of our government. Therefore, the 100 million yuan loan originally contracted with allied banking groups at the time of the bank's establishment has now matured. Another 100 million yuan has been added, forming a loan of 200 million yuan. The government and allied banking groups have re-signed the agreement to provide for the development of the bank's business. With this huge amount of capital, the circulation of its banknotes and the credit of its finance will inevitably become more developed, and the foundation of its parity with the Japanese yen will also become increasingly firm. The mission that the government expects of the bank will surely be accomplished. Today, on the occasion of the bank's fifth anniversary, I am making the above speech and expressing my sincere gratitude to the allied nations for their assistance."</p>

<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai) In order to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, the Ministry of Finance recently issued three articles of restrictive lending measures, ordering all banking and financial industries to comply, in order to completely eliminate the rampant lending business of banking and financial industries and prevent the trend of hoarding and speculation. Minister Zhou also made a statement to reporters regarding the restriction of lending by the banking and financial industries, stating that if the Banking and Financial Industries Association cannot effectively restrict its fellow traders through self-governance, the government will take necessary measures to order the Financial Affairs Inspection Office to conduct a review of various loans. It is understood that after receiving the order, the Banking and Financial Industries Association has issued a circular to all firms in the name of the Banking and Financial Industries Joint Committee to comply.</p>

<p>In order to crack down on securities speculation, the authorities have stipulated that anyone engaged in the securities business must obtain permission and a business license, and be allowed to operate under the supervision of the authorities. All stock companies that have not been authorized have been temporarily closed and their operations suspended. Recently, in order to comply with laws and regulations, companies and firms engaged in stock trading have united their fellow traders, organized sound institutions, and are preparing to organize a trade association, and register with the regulatory authorities in accordance with the law. The authorities will establish a Chinese Stock Review Committee to review the stocks listed on the market. In the future, all stock companies will operate their businesses in full compliance with the "Chinese Stock Trading Restriction Rules" promulgated by the government.</p>

<p>There are 81 insurance companies in the city, 24 of which were established before December 8th of the previous year, with a total capital of 16,065,000 yuan. The other 57 companies were established after December 8th, with a total capital of 52,362,500 yuan, totaling 68,427,500 yuan. The total number of companies is 81, but the total capital is only more than 60 million yuan, which is not healthy. Previously, because most insurance companies reinsured with British and American insurance companies, if a major compensation event occurred, the Chinese insurance industry would not be seriously affected. Now that British and American companies have closed down, applying for reinsurance is not as convenient as before. Therefore, if a huge compensation event occurs, small-scale insurance companies are in danger of collapsing. Powerful insurance companies in this city, in view of this, have specially jointly organized a Chinese Joint Insurance Company to take over reinsurance as its main business. This is a move by the Chinese insurance industry to seek independence, which is very noteworthy.</p>

In addition, the China Economic Research Association was also established in the winter of last year. Zhou Zuomin, chairman of Jin Cheng Bank, and others enriched the research work and expanded the scope of research, making it necessary to merge the organizations. After several exchanges of opinions, and on the 9th, both parties held a meeting to discuss and decide to merge the organizations, calling it the China Economic Research Association. Zhou Zuomin was elected as the chairman of the board of directors, Li Shengbo and Wu Zhenxiu were elected as standing directors, and Yao Qingsan was elected as the director of the secretariat. Part of the China Economic Research Institute was transformed into the research department of the association, and Li Quanshi was still hired as the director. It started working on the same day.

<p>Since the autumn of last year, a large number of new banks and financial institutions have been established in this city. The authorities, in view of this phenomenon, considered it to be a morbid development in the financial industry. Therefore, they once considered merging some of the newly established banks. All parties are extremely concerned about this matter. Recently, the authorities have formulated detailed measures for adjusting the finances of this city and cracking down on hoarding and speculation, and for restricting the lending of banks and financial institutions, so that merchants engaged in hoarding goods cannot use the funds of banks and financial institutions. Once this method is implemented, the trend of hoarding in this city can be eliminated. Therefore, the merger of newly established banks can be temporarily postponed.</p>

<p>In order to suppress prices, the authorities have repeatedly ordered various banks and financial institutions to recall all loans that do not involve production, in order to tighten the money supply in the market, so that speculators cannot mobilize funds and no longer interfere with the market. The authorities, in view of the fact that several large trust companies in this port also have bank shares and are engaged in lending business to merchants in various industries, believe that this type of business clearly exceeds the normal scope of trust company business and that it is necessary to crack down on it. Therefore, in addition to strictly ordering the company to comply with the "Regulations on the Management of Financial Institutions" promulgated by the government, they also ordered each company to automatically revoke its banking department business from today and to recover the loans that have been issued as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Hangzhou City Government Prevents Soaring Prices <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>In the past two months, prices in Hangzhou have been soaring, especially the price of daily necessities, which has risen dramatically, with some rising several times, which has greatly affected people's livelihoods. The reason for this? Although the source is scarce, the hoarding and speculation of unscrupulous merchants and holding goods at high prices is also a major reason. Because the foreign companies that distribute goods in this city only distribute to a few wholesale merchants, and the wholesale merchants arbitrarily raise prices and engage in the black market privately after obtaining the goods. Retailers have to purchase goods from the black market in order to maintain their business, and sell them on the black market. The sufferers are the general public. Therefore, to suppress prices, it is necessary to implement a universal distribution system, and it should be done immediately, without delay. It is now known that the Hangzhou City Government, in view of the rising prices in recent days and the anxiety of the public, believes that if it is not strictly controlled, the impact will be significant. It has specially dispatched price investigation teams to investigate. If there are any stores hoarding and speculating, the goods will be reported and dealt with. It has been working strictly in recent days and has already found several stores.</p>

<h3 id="e82">The Importance of Income Tax in National Tax Revenue <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Ze</p>
<p>Income tax is a good tax for the country, which has long been recognized by the world. Looking at the proposal to implement income tax in our country, it dates back to the end of the Qing Dynasty, but it has been more than 30 years since then, and it has not been implemented. Although it has been discussed and promulgated several times in the middle, it was not until July of the 24th year of the Republic of China that the Ministry of Finance decided to levy income tax to make up for the shortfall in tax revenue and the reduction in national treasury revenue. Therefore, in July and August of the 25th year of the Republic of China, the "Provisional Income Tax Regulations" and "Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations" were promulgated successively. At this point, there was a small amount of income tax revenue in the financial tax revenue of our country. Soon after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, the implementation of income tax was once again suspended invisibly. Therefore, in fact, the position of income tax in our country's tax revenue is very small.</p>
<p>Since the National Government returned to the capital, it has strived to reform finance, and the announcement of the method of levying income tax has been made. It is expected that soon, income tax will become the most important tax revenue in our country. However, the general public is afraid that there are still reasons for not understanding the income tax that should be promoted. Therefore, it is necessary to promote and explain the public opinion, so as to achieve universal understanding.</p>
<p>Income tax, in short, is a tax levied based on the income of individuals or companies. The reason why it is promoted as a good tax system is nothing more than the following reasons:</p>
<p>(1) Universal burden - Tax payment is the obligation of the people. Income tax is levied on the basis of the size of income. Anyone, except those whose income does not meet the tax standard, is subject to taxation. Therefore, income tax is not as limited to local areas as other direct taxes (such as land tax only applies to farmers), and cannot be universal.</p>
<p>Fair burden - Various indirect taxes, such as unified tax, stamp tax, and salt tax, are all proportional taxes. Therefore, from the perspective of the tax-paying ability of the rich and poor classes, the rich bear less burden, while the poor bear more burden, which is very unfair. As for income tax, it is different, because its tax rate is calculated progressively. The larger the income, the higher the tax rate. Therefore, each person's tax burden is increased or decreased in proportion to their tax-paying ability, so it is in line with the principle of tax fairness.</p>
<p>(3) Elasticity - The state determines its expenditure based on its income. Only when the revenue is elastic can the expenditure be increased or decreased at will. Modern international relations are complex, and changes in expenditure often undergo great changes due to wars or other reasons. Therefore, the revenue of taxes should be elastic. The income tax rate is the most convenient to adjust, and the elasticity of its tax revenue is also the strongest. Therefore, the state can increase or decrease its tax rate according to its financial needs.</p>
<p>(4) Sufficient tax source - Income tax is</p>
<p>a national tax levied universally. The source of its tax revenue comes from the income of all the people. Therefore, it goes without saying that the tax revenue is sufficient.</p>
<p>(5) Tax revenue is certain - In addition to a sufficient tax source, the purpose of national taxation is to ensure the certainty of tax revenue. If there is no certainty in the revenue, the budget is difficult to make. Income tax is a direct tax, which comes from the income of all the people. Therefore, even if there is an emergency, its revenue will not be as uncertain as other tax revenues.</p>
<p>(6) Suitable for financial tax revenue in extraordinary times - In extraordinary times, the government's expenditure will inevitably increase sharply. In addition to issuing public bonds and using inflation to raise war funds, increasing the tax rate is also an inevitable method. However, there are two types of tax increases: direct and indirect. Indirect taxes are levied at proportional tax rates. Increasing indirect taxes not only violates the principle of tax fairness, but also causes an uneven tax burden on the people due to the prolongation of the war. On the contrary, income tax is a direct tax, and its tax rate is a progressive rate system. In addition, it has very good elasticity, so it is of course very suitable for use in extraordinary times.</p>
<p>Taking into account the above points, there is no doubt that income tax is a good tax system. Looking at various countries, the income from income tax accounts for a large part of the national tax revenue. According to the survey, income tax accounts for 50.7% of the national tax revenue in the United States, 43.3% in the United Kingdom, 30.1% in France, 10.2% in Japan, 14.2% in Italy, and 23.6% in Germany. Looking back at our country, the main tax revenues in the past were indirect taxes such as customs duties, salt tax, and unified tax, while the levying of income tax is still a recent measure. All our people should work together, and we hope that the government authorities can pay the greatest attention to the investigation and supervision of income tax and find ways to promote a sound accounting system.</p>

<p>Berlin, March 9th, Haitong News Agency - Italy's wartime economic resistance is quite strong. The supply of food, clothing, and even coal and iron to the people has not been interrupted. In the industrial sector, there is a constant lack of raw materials. For example, Italy needs 14 million tons of coal every year, but now it can only supply 5 million tons by itself. For example, it needs 2.5 million tons of steel every year, but only two-thirds of this amount can be supplied by itself. But the shortage can be supplied by Germany.</p>

<p>— Hong Ying</p>
<p>Throughout the history of China and foreign countries, there have been countless scientists, revolutionaries, politicians, doctors..., who sacrificed their lives in order to relieve the suffering of the masses and seek the eternal happiness of mankind.</p>
<p>Lincoln fought tirelessly for the freedom of black slaves, Edison buried himself in the laboratory all day long for the happiness of mankind; Wilson appealed and traveled everywhere for world peace. Their hearts are broad, their vision is far-sighted, and they do not take their own happiness as the purpose of life. They can think of millions of people, always remember the many people around them who are suffering; they have justice, blood, sympathy, and they have the spirit of self-sacrifice for the group!</p>
<p>There are fewer happy people and more suffering people in the world. Many people are living like beasts of burden due to various oppressions; they have lost their freedom and do not have the rights they should enjoy; their lives are forever lost in the abyss of darkness and pain. But, they want happiness! They want freedom! They yearn for the help and sympathy of righteous people.</p>
<p>Young friends, we should not have the selfish and self-interested concept of the individual self. Our lives belong to the masses; we should work hard for the masses, we should have the spirit of self-sacrifice for the group, and do our best to liberate the suffering people!</p>
<h3 id="e90">Nietzsche's Gift to Wagner (Part 1) <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— By Lincoln Schuster, Translated by Gu Xin</p>
<p>—One of the Letters of World-Renowned Artists</p>
<p>Foreword: When Friedrich Nietzsche was a young man, he became friends with Richard Wagner, who was thirty years his senior and a central figure in German culture. Nietzsche, the young and arrogant philosopher, was then composing music on the piano and deeply admired Wagner's achievements. He once said, "Without music, life is a mistake."</p>
<p>Wagner had a tremendous influence on Nietzsche's life. They first met when Wagner was living near Basel, and Nietzsche was teaching classical philosophy at the University of Basel. They spent Christmas together in 1869, with Wagner as the host and teacher, and Nietzsche as his disciple.</p>
<p>Encouraged by Wagner, Nietzsche began writing his first book, "The Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of Music." He secluded himself in a house at the foot of the Alps, quietly contemplating, forming the core of his thought, which eventually developed into the theme of his entire philosophy: "For the first time, I felt that the most powerful and noble will in life is not manifested in struggling for survival, but in the will to war, the will to power, and the will to conquer."</p>
<p>Nietzsche praised Wagner as "another Aeschylus, restoring mythology and symbols, and uniting the joy of incense and drums in the Dionysian ecstasy… a Siegfried who never knew what fear meant…" He paid devout homage to the Bayreuth opera festival, regarding it as "a sign of vigor full of vigor for the expedition."</p>
<p>However, soon, this young hero worshiper became fond of criticism, delving into everything, which gradually changed his views. At that time, Wagner completed "The Ring of the Nibelungs," achieving "supreme victory," and kings and ministers from all over the world paid homage to him, while Nietzsche, with his apocalyptic vision, saw directly behind the stage: he was shaken and horrified by what he saw. He thought that a knight-errant like Siegfried had become a high priest like Parsifal; and since he was unwilling to be a novice anymore and had fully matured in philosophy, he refused to burn incense. But Wagner openly and arrogantly demanded that he burn incense. Thus, the famous dispute between Nietzsche and Wagner began, and their opinions grew deeper and deeper until the two old friends broke off relations.</p>
<p>Finally, Nietzsche quietly abandoned his gods and heroes, declaring that he "deeply loathed all feminine qualities and random actions, which exist in romanticism, ideal lies, and the softening of human conscience, which had succumbed to someone among the bravest people."</p>
<p>This scholarly discord was now irreconcilable. Now Wagner lived in Sorrento, working on an opera starring Parsifal, and Nietzsche lived next door to him; they did not even exchange a word. The young man who was once a vassal was now a discordant philosopher, without any sympathy for the once-popular musical master. He thought Wagner was a traveling charlatan, only praising "pity, sexless love, Jesus's foolishness." This statement was actually the cause of Nietzsche's extreme conflict with the new opera—in H.L. Mencken's words, this statement "has long been a theme, giving rise to various vague rumors and ambiguous whispers."</p>
<p>Shortly before Nietzsche wrote the following letter, Wagner had taken a newly published opera of Parsifal, inscribed his name, and sent it to Nietzsche as a token of reconciliation. At this time, Nietzsche was writing "Human, All Too Human," in which he wrote his recent art doctrines, directly opposing Wagner's doctrines. When the gift arrived, Nietzsche was greatly moved. According to his sister, he thought "what a great shock the Wagnerians would get when they read the book he wrote," so he decided to publish the book anonymously, and at the same time write this letter to Wagner, telling him alone who the author of the book was, "and he did not succumb in the slightest to his own intellectual independence." The letter was not dated, but was probably written between 1878 and 1880.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Tenth Place in the January Essay Contest: My Life <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Mengyun</p>
<p>A proverb says, "Nine out of ten teachers are poor." This has always been the case. As one with a heavy burden, I am of course no exception. However, I do not dislike my fourteen years of teaching life, but on the contrary, I have considerable fondness for it. Therefore, the good intentions of my friends' recommendations to change careers to business, and the good plans of my family's advice, have finally been acknowledged with appreciation, and only expressed gratitude. As the saying goes, "People cannot bear its sorrow, but Hui does not change his joy." And I, insignificant as I am, can be considered to be enjoying it.</p>
<p>Tolstoy said, "Life is not about enjoyment, but about hard work." Zola recalled his past hardships in his later years: "At that time, if I had bread and potatoes, it would be enough to fill my stomach, and if I occasionally got a candle, I would have the joy of ascending to heaven if I could read at night." The more hard work and simple life, the stronger the will, and the more valuable survival. When the spirit has a place to rest, even if the enjoyment is less, there is no such thing as suffering. Confucius said, "Eating coarse rice and drinking water, and bending one's arm for a pillow, joy is also within it. Wealth and honor obtained unrighteously are to me like floating clouds." Although I dare not compare myself to sages and heroes, I am very willing to take this essay opportunity to write about my daily life, hoping to add more instruction.</p>
<p>(A) Continuing Education Issues: I always feel that my continuing education is not enough, and I am always worried, because education is constantly innovating and advancing with the times, and should be in line with social reality; therefore, the content of textbooks should be explored, and the research and improvement of teaching methods should be constantly and fully improved in order to be effective and to be able to face oneself without shame. Especially since I am not a teacher from the regular path, and my foundation is shallow, it is even more necessary. In other words, even if I am not a teacher, I should read more books and cultivate knowledge: because having morality and conscience alone without knowledge is still not enough. In recent years, due to various problems, the time for continuing education has been reduced by two-thirds compared to the past. I want to find a way to make up for it from today.</p>
<p>(B) Clothing Issues: I have always been casual about clothing; especially in the past three years of winter, I have always worn a padded gown and single pants. Habit becomes nature, and I don't feel anything. Only "leather shoes" are my benefactor; because they are comfortable to run in, they are indeed not as good as "cloth shoes." My "leather shoes" are all bought from old goods stalls everywhere. They are indeed cheap. The shoe head and heel are each nailed with iron nails, which is more economical and practical.</p>
<p>(C) Food Issues: Because part-time teaching is too scattered, it is inconvenient to return home for lunch; but it is difficult to go to restaurants. I know that I have a super-sized appetite, so I can only have vegetables and tofu for meals. The rest I just buy some dry snacks to fill my stomach. In terms of family, I have a set schedule: on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th days, "the family's rice is cooked into corn porridge." On the 2nd, 4th, and 6th days, "mix broken rice noodles with soybean sprouts." (or green vegetables and spinach) On the 7th, 8th, and 9th days, "vegetables (or spinach, strips of soybean sprouts, or small shepherd's purse.) noodles." On the 10th day, "the family's rice is cooked with red bean rice" (the side dishes are mainly prepared by my wife). This combination has been practiced for a long time. Regarding the food issue, it does not seem to be very serious; and each of the seven members of the family is healthy and agile.</p>
<p>(D) Housing Issues: I don't care about the quality of clothing and food, but I refuse to make do with housing. This is my consistent policy. The three-story wide unified building is considered comfortable after all. The front building faces south with plenty of sunshine. It is used as a study room, individual teaching room, and also as my personal bedroom; because I have always liked to sleep on "hard pine boards," which is refreshing. Recently, I have become even more radical, borrowing the "floor," which is even more free. The rear building is where my wife and children live, and because the furniture is simple, it is still tidy. The only drawback is that the second landlord asked me to take care of the electricity myself, and I have not yet installed a separate meter. At first, burning "foreign candles" was really unaffordable. Now I use bean oil, "lamp grass life," to barely support myself. I admire the four students in this class, the first being Mr. Li of the Department of Economics of a certain university, the second being Mr. Yuan of Xintaihao on Henan Road, and the third and fourth being Mr. Gu and Mr. Zhong of Oriental Chemical Industrial Company. Every night, under this ill-equipped "bean oil lamp, they concentrate on studying their subjects; and they also voluntarily subsidize the oil costs. This kind of studious attitude and mutual assistance spirit is admirable.</p>
<p>Although my life is simple, I can still enjoy it. In short, "When it comes to knowledge and ability, look at those who are better than me; when it comes to treatment and enjoyment, look at those who are not as good as me." Naturally, I feel at ease and justified. My eldest son is twenty years old this year. Last year, he was hired by the general management office of a large bookstore. Thanks to the manager's promotion, he was promoted to accountant and can slightly help with household expenses. However, in each of my letters, there is always such a set, like a routine official document.</p>

<p>— Shi Xin</p>
<p>It's better not to be rich than to be rich! We can see that in this society, there are quite a few people who don't want to be rich but naturally become rich. There are also many people who can choose not to be rich. But there are more people who want to be rich but cannot be rich, and people who cannot help but want to be rich.</p>
<p>Great tolerance brings great blessings! Worrying about rice for the night in the morning, half-hungry and half-starved, toiling like a beast of burden all day long, risking their God-given life, not daring to violate the law for the sake of social tranquility, the numbers of these people cannot be greater.</p>
<p>Using the yard to grow vegetables can help the people's livelihood and economy. In a room the size of a monk's cell, parents, wife and eight people cannot even turn around. How many people in Shanghai are in this situation? More than eight out of ten? For those who have empty land in their residences, flowers and plants are more important than vegetables!</p>
<p>These words are all right. But changing the perspective, they are not necessarily all right!</p>

<p>When Yang Zijie finished speaking, he gave a barely visible smile, made a barely audible laugh, and stopped talking. It wasn't that he had nothing to say, nor was it that he was convinced by her words; seeing her solemn and confident attitude, he dared not recklessly comment on her.</p>

<p>"Has Uncle Wang just arrived?" she said, and then stood up and walked over, stopping in front of Gen Ming, "How is Aunt? Is everything well at home?"</p>
<p>"Everyone else is fine," his eyebrows suddenly furrowed, "but Da Gen is not well, he has been sick for more than a month!"</p>
<p>"Today you are—" As she said this, she suddenly turned to her father and said, "Father, you still remember the situation three months ago when we took refuge in his house! Father, you must socialize more."</p>
<p>"No, Third Miss," Gen Ming said quickly, "I'm not here to borrow money, I'm here to sell land."</p>
<p>"Sell land? Where will you have land to plant?" A look of surprise.</p>
<p>"Third Miss, you don't understand," Yu Du asked, explaining for him, "Even if you sell it, you can still plant it, but you have to pay rent."</p>
<p>"Can't you avoid selling it?" Her question was ostensibly directed at Gen Ming, but her bright eyes swept towards her father as she asked this question.</p>
<p>Her father didn't say anything. After waiting for a while, Gen Ming said in a pained voice, "Where will the money come from if I don't sell it!" (9) Social Services</p>
<h3 id="e94">Thousands of Dollars for a Baby's One-Month Celebration Donated to This Newspaper's Small Loan Fund, Hoping for a Response from All Sectors <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>This newspaper, in response to the needs of the times, has established a small loan fund and medical aid for elementary school teachers, which has been enthusiastically supported by all sectors, contributing what they can, contributing money if they have it, strength if they have it. Strength is not divided into big or small, and money is not counted in large or small amounts, only that each does their best to help each other. Yesterday, Mr. Zhang Liangyu of Shende Qianzhuang donated 1,000 yuan of congratulatory gifts from relatives and friends for his son's one-month celebration, as well as savings from frugal meals, to this newspaper's small loan fund. His benevolent wind and virtuous conduct are truly admirable. Mr. Zhang's move not only helps the poor, but also sets an example for others. I sincerely hope that the general public in society can enthusiastically promote and continuously support, benefiting poor compatriots, with boundless virtue.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Aurora Women's University Establishes a Simple Junior High School Class <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Tang</p>
<p>Aurora Women's University recently established a simple junior high school class, giving more out-of-school female students an opportunity to study. The class time is from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM every Monday to Friday. There are not a few female students who are out of school after graduating from Shanghai High School. Some are due to family circumstances, while others are due to economic problems. The school not only has short class hours every day, but also includes the main courses that should be learned in general ordinary junior high schools, such as Chinese, foreign language, mathematics, science, social sciences, and natural sciences, which are taught by specialized teachers, which is very suitable for the needs of part-time students. Because Aurora Women's University has a Department of Education, the teaching aspect of the simple junior high school class also adopts newer and more effective methods. At the same time, in order to alleviate the economic difficulties of poor students, the school has set up scholarship places. Those with excellent academic performance and poor family backgrounds can apply for free tuition. As for the tuition fees, miscellaneous fees, and book fees stipulated by the class, each semester is only 100 yuan. I think this is really a good opportunity for out-of-school women in general. Those who are ambitious to study are urged to go to Aurora Women's College of Arts and Sciences at 181 Rue Bourgeois, French Concession to register. I heard that there are still many places left.</p>
