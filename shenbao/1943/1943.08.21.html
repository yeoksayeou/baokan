<p>社評</p>
<h3>強化中日合作——歡迎靑木大臣</h3>
<p>靑木大臣離華以來，瞬已十閱月，在此十個月間，東亞之地位，日趨重要。特別是友邦日本對華新政策之實施，南洋諸邦在日本提携下之發展，配合着大東亞戰爭的勝利，使東亞共榮圈建設前途，頓呈光明。我們今日在此新事態之下，歡迎靑木大臣之蒞臨訪問，充滿着欣慰的熱情，實有非筆墨所能形容於萬一者。</p>
<p>據昨日報載消息，靑木大臣此次蒞臨我國，一爲與我當局進行懇談，二爲視察對華新政策實行以來的情况，三爲考察日本在華機關之活動狀况，四爲與友邦在華陸海軍常局交換意見。總之一句話，是在謀强化中日協力，以完遂大柬亞戰爭。我們知道，靑木大臣自就任以來，未及一年，而對華新政策之實施，盡力之多，推進之力，成功之大，已有意外之收穫。而不久之前，靑木大臣更親臨南洋，巡行各地，一本大東亞共榮共存的精神，指導及協助久在英美帝國主義壓迫下的束亞諸邦自强獨立，今泰國方慶收復失地，完遂夙願；緬甸的獨立，繼在友邦協助指導之下宜吿成功，而爪哇土民之參加政治，非律賓之獨立亦在積極準備中，大東亞民族之解放事業，已漸見光明，太平洋大憲童已爲無明文的實踐，這雖不是靑木大臣一人之力，但是「勞苦功高」，每一個東亞人民，常未有不瞭然的，特別是我們中國人民，回想靑木大臣從前任國府顧間時之功績，以及年來對華新政策之推動，於感謝之餘，自顧對於大東亞戰爭，所盡力量，未符實際需要，不能不感到惶　。</p>
<p>現在國際局勢，日趨嚴重，迫切需要東亞民族尤其是需要於中日兩國以大無畏的精神，由爭取大東亞戰爭最後的勝利進而　定世界新秩序。我們必須加倍努力，提高民族戰鬥精神，實　國民戰時生活，增加戰時生產運動，集中全國人力物力，以期協力友邦完遂戰爭。我們更必須加强中日兩國民間的了解，加强中日兩國合作的力量，進而團結東亞十憶民衆，以建立東亞共榮圈民富國强自由互助的新秩序。我們在這裏希望上下一致在友邦新政策基礎上努力，我們摯誠地祝望靑木大臣政躬健康與此行的成功。</p>
<p>改善敎職員生活的具體辦法</p>
<p>自蔣　同君發表了「創設上海市敎職員消費合作社芻議」一文以來，頗引起社會人士的注意，現在上海市民福利會敎宵委員會首先起而響應，尤予贊助（見今日本報第四版專文）。我們希望市民福利會此次登高一呼，能够引起各方面的特別重視，出而贊助推動，使本市敎職員消費合作社早日創辦成功。</p>
<p>我們新聞工作者，與一般大中小學敎師接觸的機會較多，對於一般敎職員生活上與心理上的痛苦，所知較詳，將濤同君所說：「一個大學敎授的收人已不及一個黃包車天，一個小學敎員的月薪已在娘姨阿媽之下」敎育界這種慘象，不僅全爲事實，也許在身爲敎師者看來，還有未足以形容共痛苦之感。蓋黃包車夫之得失，限於一身一家，多賺幾文，少賺幾文，只是一身一家的　樂。，娘姨阿媽，除了工錢之外，尙有額外收入，而其工作，亦限於服侍一身一家。可是爲敎師者，不僅須化大本錢（師範及專科敎育費）及國家多年的培植，師資得之非易，實可說是國家民衆的「至實」。其次，他們工作的責任，與國家民族前途有密切的關係。地位之重要如此，責仟之艱鉅又如此，而使日夜爲生活費用之高漲所困阨，此實爲國家社會嚴重無比的損失，而敎職員消費合作社之創辦，至少可以部分地緩和敎職員之困苦。</p>
<p>從敎職員消費合作社之具體辦法說，蔣君一文既係築敎育工作者數次研究熟商的產物，而市民福利會敎育委員會又有實貴的建議，我們今日只有以下幾點希望：第一，本市各校敎職員迅速推舉代表，定期召集籌備會議，商討一切進行事宜。第二，有關常局予以最大的贊助。第三，各界然心人士繼起響應，予以協助。</p>
<p>敎職員消費合作社是今日言改善敎育及改善敎職員生活的最具體的辦法，如果這一件事尙不能協助其成功，則任何政策與計劃，如何能獲得「萬民之師」所信任　擁護呢。</p>

<h3>對日泰締約事　國府當局談話</h3>
<p>南京二十日中央社電　日·泰兩國調整領土移讓馬來撣部地方與泰國之事發表後，中央社記者特往訪政府發言人，承以談話方式表明政府所見如下：「本日日泰兩國於泰都締結調整領土條約，就條約原文與經過事實觀之，友邦日本對於東亞民族之解放，東亞新秩序之建設，不僅有高邁之理想與遠大之抱負，爲實現此理想，且　有堅强之決心，與充足之力量　對所有約束均志在必行。日泰領土締約爲其一例。此外如對我國交還　界，　廢治外法權及實現緬甸獨立，援助菲島獨立，協力印度革命，均足以表現其高大之道義精神，與對東亞　民族解放諾言之實踐。此點固爲道義國家應有之精神，竟亦適足以證明此次戰爭旨趣之所在，復足以反映英美行不踐言之劣行，其影響所及，東亞民族必　如融和親睦，協力團結　　　同生共死之精神，　　　於全東亞，</p>
<h3>東綫德軍集中　正準備反攻　夏季蘇機被毀二千架</h3>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電海通社軍事特派　塞爾托裏亞斯訉。東綫之主要戰役，仍在員爾格勒及卡科夫區進行，蘇軍在該區增加使用後備部隊，而在米沃斯河區內伊齊姆區蘇軍，亦作突進，但兩處企圖均歸失敗。在卡科夫之東兩，蘇軍進攻特別堅　，獲有不重要之戰略成功，但不能擴展爲主要之進展，此因德軍防禦優良有以致之。在卡科夫之北而及在貝爾格勒四面，蘇軍亦增加壓力，同時德軍之反壓力亦見增强，在德軍之坦克車大戰中，將有顯著之成功、而　斷蘇軍之突出部隊。在奧勒爾之西面蘇軍於德軍較弱之陣地作偵察活動，且集中大量之軍隊，有準備再向白里安斯克進攻之姿態。在莫斯科至斯摩倫斯克鐵路綫之兩側蘚軍進攻無效，受創而退，戰事現在膠着狀態中，在伊爾門湖之進攻亦告不逞，德現正集中軍隊，準備反攻，其成效可以預見也。</p>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電　德空軍方面昨日宜稱，自夏季戰爭發生以來，蘇機總共被擊落二千架。</p>
<h3>土耳其總統接見日大使</h3>

<h3>赫爾艾登參加奎貝克會議</h3>
<p>里斯本二十日中央社電　羅斯福邱吉爾艾登三人，繼續於昨日進行談話。赫爾昨夜抵奎貝克，偕來者有國務院政治顧問鄧氏。聞羅邱艾三人曾就大西洋憲章討論擬予補充之各　，又　於接受游聯之要求一點，大約亦可於會議中決定，惟詳細情形，若疆界之決定等，則須於戰後始能解決。至於軍事問題，亦當於會議中握出討論，聞空中侵略之計劃，須先得羅斯福邱吉爾之同意，然後再由艾登赴莫斯科與蘇洽商。衆信攻歐之不事行動，將由英將領任總司令，而艾森　　仍將負責地中海方面戰事</p>
<p>軍略政略縝密討論</p>
<p>阿根廷京城二十日中央社電　英外相艾登十八日與邱吉爾羅斯福會談至深夜，十九日上午又與二人重作協議歷數小時，會談題目據云為反軸心軍之攻略問題。路透社特派員透露此次會談之結果或係闡明下列之事項：　關於維持大四洋憲章之新聲明。　關於聲明戰時以及將來之美英蘇三國關係</p>
<p>奎貝克二十日中央社電　據海通社訉：英外相艾登偕同情報大臣白蘭根抵此後，立即訪問邱吉爾開始會議，發電時尙未完學。艾登與悄報大臣同行，愈益增加此次會議政治性質多於軍事性質之印象，艾白奪氏之隨員不甚發表言論，顯示此次會議之軍事性質。且到逮此間之英美外交人員甚少，不致有重大之政治決定，然一般人士以爲政治問題亦甚迫切，英美領袖亦不能忽視，義國宣在羅馬爲不設防城市問題，承認特戈爾季勞委員會問題等項均曾提及。</p>
<h3>英軍事代表　將赴太年洋視察</h3>

<p>里斯本二十日中央社電　新德里　息：戴維遜少將已就化美駐印第十空軍命令職，前任司令畢　爾少將已返華盛頓，將改任他職，戴維遜現年五十三歲。</p>
<h3>德機猛襲比塞大港　毀敵船十萬噸</h3>
<p>西西里島軍事設施德軍予以澈底破壞</p>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電　據海通社訉：德轟炸機隊於星期三晚再襲比塞大港集中之船隻，至少有船十二艘直接中彈。又關於星期二晚德機縣該處之詳情，茲經探悉如下：德機係分批於傍晚及夜間月光之下進襲目標，敵防禦砲火甚爲猛烈，敵方且擬以人造霧掩蔽海港，同時攻襲目標亦多有氣球阻隔，探照燈亦殊活躍，結果德機仍能擊傷中型船隻三十七艘，約計一〇〇〇〇〇噸，使西西里之敵軍供應大受打擊。</p>
<p>日內瓦二十日中央社電　據約克日報特派員稱：軸心軍對西西里之軍事設施，加以徹底破壞，此足阻止反軸心軍之順利前進。有目睹破壞之區域者　即有埃特那山剛行燥發之感焉。</p>
<h3>法國一寡婦　將受榮典</h3>
<p>維希二十日中央社電　法國某寡婦於第一次世界大戰時喪失其夫，而在一九三九至一九四〇之役時　其子亦遭戰死，該婦人將受特別榮典，貝當元首決定時與特製之胸口針一枚以誌紀念。</p>
<h3>軸心各國加緊聯繫　英美大肆狡猾宣傳　次期作戰計劃成為畫餅</h3>
<p>歐洲戰塲的現况，在政治，軍事兩方面，軸心國均不甚順利。蘇聯軍在中部戰綫業已收復奧萊爾，迫近卡科夫。在西西里戰綫，軸心軍已全島撤退。在這現狀下，英美用大事狡猾宣傳，以擾亂軸心國的後方，而昂揚木國人民的民氣。我們應該知道，英美這種宣傳的目的，第一，刺激德義民衆的反政府感情；第二，離間軸心國間之堅强的聯繫。</p>
<p>自從加薩勃朗加會談之後，英美的宣傳似乎巳到了最高峯下面我們來介紹一個例子：</p>
<p>英美方而最近每日報道義國國內的不安情况，說在米闌　特里諾，熱諾亞等義國北部地方，義國民衆的反新政府運動，風起靈湧。又據十日的紐約電報，義國勞働總同盟及社曾主義黨發動總罷工，罷工者求立即停止戰爭，且向英美二國聲訴要求尊重義國人民的權利。</p>
<p>對於上述英美方面的煽惑性宣傳，於九日從羅馬乘機還囘巴　　納的西班牙駐　馬外交官曾闡述義國內部的眞相說：</p>
<p>「義　民衆，上下一心，服從巴陀里奧元一軸的統率」</p>
<p>從上面的言論中，　　　白義國人民業巳捨棄了　人的根性，而充滿着熟忱的愛國心，英美的宜傳，盡屬子虛。又據柏林的報道，米蘭。特里諾。熱諾亞等地，雖曾貼滿了實行總罷工的標語，但並未泰效。最近外電的報這，以上三都市，既無罷工，又無促進和平的示威運動，可見英美方而播送的消息完全是虛構。</p>
<p>這　，英美因爲對義的宣傳無效，乃掉　鎗鋒，轉向德國。十日的倫敦情報說：</p>
<p>「希特勒業已失却了者日的萬能的地步，武力革命現在是勢所必至的。」</p>
<p>可是這報道的後面又附有並未確認希待勒失落政權說的流傳的但書，而說希特勒在德國依然佔有穩固的地位。又十日的倫敦消息稱：</p>
<p>「瑞典停止德軍假道國境，這是對德國武力之大胆的挑戰。同時又表示瑞典早已不對德國望風披靡了。」</p>
<p>又說：「在南歐洲並巴爾幹諸國正表示想急於脫離戰爭之匈牙利。羅馬尼亞。保加利亞的指導者，正想互相締結某種協定，使他們可以順利地脫離戰爭的漩渦。」這種英美方面的宣傳，每天在反軸心國及中立國的報紙上運篇累贖地記載着。德義在這種濫調的宣傳中，對於英美的第二步作戰，毫不放鬆，加以嚴密注視。德國之所以從德蘇戰綫撤退者，乃在準備戰綫以應付歐洲的新情勢，關於英美軍的次期作戰，大體可舉出如次三地點：</p>
<p>義大利本士－－英美軍似將直衝義大利本土，但在沒有佔領撒丁島及科西嘉島以前，是否將實行這一着，成爲疑問。</p>
<p>希臘－－英美預定在西西里戰局告終後，即率大軍侵入希臘，但這時候他們不能不在克里特島登陸。</p>
<p>法國南部海岸，有人觀測英美軍或許將擇法國南部某地海岸登陸。反軸心軍是否敢於巧妙地作這種大胆的敵前登陸作戰。實成問題。德義軍當局早已秘密地準備一切，以應付未來的英美軍登陸戰。</p>
<p>舉例來說，關於巴爾幹防軍司令羅美兩元帥，有下述消息：</p>
<p>在他的下面。增派了四個新銳師團的戰車隊，並積極建設空軍基地，以備即將坩强的空軍之需。又據最近巴爾幹方面來的報近，德國排除一切困難，以確保希臘，並其他巴爾幹做域。</p>
<p>而在另一力面，莫斯料要求第二戰錢的呼聲，日趨激烈。英美即使照例用猜忌的眼看着蘇聯，至此也不能不另　某種對策以爲應付了</p>
<p>歐洲的戰局，率直地說來，德義現在遭遇了不利的情勢，而站於防禦的立塲。可是英美對蘇聯之微妙的相互關係，在英美方面視爲是頭痛的原因。這種情勢，我們不能斷言英美在最後不會受致很大的蹉跌。所以日德義三國人民應依粮三國之密切的合作，不要使敵方離間的宣傳有機可乘。軸心各國的協調，及各國堅持其國內戰綫、實是從這世界戰爭中獲得勝利的唯一方法。（翔：　自八月十四日朿京朝日新聞）。</p>

<h3>日陸軍發言人　昨談話</h3>
<p>中央社滬訉　上海日陸軍部發言人，昨（廿）日會見記者團時，就渝方抗戰陣綫之理論不統一，申述如次：</p>
<p>谷萩大本營陸軍報道部長，曾於十九日引述中央日報及大公報對羅邱魁北克會議之社論，一語道破英美對重慶抗戰六年之報酬，並非武器而是滅亡，於茲本人再以中央日報大公報該常社論所暴露之渝方抗戰陣綫內，對世界戰局意見之紛岐輿對立，附出說明。十七日出版之該兩報社論，均係對羅斯福邱吉爾魁北克會談表明渝方意見之觀測性論文，中央日報對史太林不參加魁北克會議，企圖曲加辯護，但大公報則始終步英美宣傳之後驅，而著　立論，中央日報社論中有言曰：「蘇聯代表之不參加會議，　因該會議被目爲專討論東亞問題者，但日蘇兩國尙未進入交戰狀態故也」云云，對史太林立塲詳加釋明，力言本會議討論中心，在於東亞戰局，率直披　渝國民黨方面之希望，但大公報認爲該會議之主要議　乃在處理墨索里尼下野後之義大利，或在討論西西里陷落後之歐洲登陸作戰，亦即開闢歐洲第二戰綫問題，並下警吿稱：東亞問題，亦不能輕視，但結果仍特歐洲第一主義的結論。該兩報見解之紛岐，從兩報之性格上而觀，吾人更深感一其重要性、尤右一點更値車視者，此亦爲國共兩黨即重慶與延安間，對世界戰局之意見對立也。</p>
<p>最近重慶方面，主張太平洋作戰第一主義，以打倒日本為先記條件，並力言中國大陸為對日反攻基地之重要性，以及必須對重慶援助軍需物資，但延安方面依然以蘇聯之主張爲根據，主張歐洲第一主義，對開闢第二戰綫，尤竭力主張，此在中共中央之七七宣言中，亦可明白認出，如上述渝方抗戰陣綫之內部，國各黨各派之立場不同，各處對立地位，且此種分歧，並非僅對於世界戰局而已，對於各般問題，莫不如是。</p>

<h3>收回租界如何建設新上海在分務員靑少年團暑訓營演講</h3>
<p>— 陳公博</p>
<p>現在上海兩個租界都收囘了，上海行政可以統一了，似平建設理想的新火上海，可以着手而且可以順利進行了，可是上海還右許多不自然的事實存收，譬如拿區域來說罷，上海還右三個區城，第一個區域是上海特別區，那就是寶山·嘉定·　資·南匯·川沙·北橋·崇明，這些區域都是以前江蘇省的各縣，按照市區擴展的定例來說，市區的發展，應當按照工商業的發達而擴大，照我觀察，一百年以後，工商業還發展不到這些地方，將來上海一般情形安定以後，我們要把這些特別區，歸還江蘇省的。第二個區城是第二區至第七區，這些是普通區，就是以前我們所稱市中心，滬北，撫西，浦東北區，沛東南區，和南市、這是我們預料工南業不久要繁榮到這些地方，而要改爲區公所，直轄於市府各局行政的。第三個區域是第一區和第八區，那就是以前的公共租界和法租界，目前雖然叫做普通區、而囚爲組織龐大，縮改不易，不能不暫維現狀，使之慢慢統一的。</p>
<p>一八兩區先行合併</p>
<p>關於名區的統一計劃，打算先從第一和第八區着手，因爲這兩區的設施，大致柑同，因此擬於六個月內，先將第一和第八區合伊。但　一和第八區所謂相同者，也不過指施設而言，其中不同之點，還有許多。就制度言，從前公共租界最高決定權在公董局，工部局祗是執行機關，公　局很像國會，而工部局很像內閣，而從前法租界則大權在於法國總領事，而公董局類於一個諮詢機關。其次公共租界的警察，是屬於工部局管轄的，而法租界的警察，是獨立於丁部局以外。而受法總領事指揮的。就人民的負擔言，公共租界和法租界很多不相同地方，捐稅的種類　右互異，至從前兩租界職員的待遇也右不同，很顯明的外國人在法租界的薪俸比公共租界高，而中國人的　　比公共租界低，法界職員　右退職金而沒有年　，而公共租界則有　種類於文官制度的規定，所以要統一上海行政，先須從統一第一第八兩區制度始，因此今日猶有一八兩區，井且還有第一第二和第三警察局三局，就是這個原故。我們希望於三個月內，先合倂第一和第三警察局。六個月內合倂第一第八兩區，至於要完全統一上海，恐怕　要相常時期，看看工商業的發展，和人民擔負的能力爲　。不增加各區人民的負擔，那麼在一個區內，右輕重之分，若增加人民負擔，又恐人民負擔不起。這都是常局者計劃時候頓慮之點。</p>
<p>工程進展毋庸憂慮</p>
<p>行政大要旣巳說過要說到工程問題了。都市　要緊是工程，所以外　許多小城市都以工程師做市長，因為都市建築不好，道路不固，電力自來水不良，電車電話及其他交通工具不便，公共衛生設備不全，無論市政怎樣好法，也是假話。上海各種設備，具有規模，　有市府的兩租界之分，不能統一，限於界　，不能進步，今後工商業繼續繁榮，對於工程進展是毋庸憂慮的。</p>
<p>在今日的上海，我以為市政是沒有多大問題，我最引為憂慮的，是上海的人心和風俗。我今天想對諸位說的，右幾個我引爲非改革不可的問題。（未完）</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>市典</h3>
<p>本市針脅福利局，以市區押當利息過重，直接間接均足以影響社會經濟，以是呈准市府、設立市與，以期普遍調　平民經濟，而南市市典，且已定期正式開業。這樣一個小小措施，確是社會福利問題所繫。因爲平民經濟，由此得到周轉，而生活負擔，不致過於加重，是來始非解決平民生計之一道。我們大家都如道，自從物價不斷的高漲以來，不但一般平民。不能不特與質以維生活，即藉水階級中人，亦大都不能憑恃右限制之收入，應付無限制之物價，因此，衣物之典質與變賣，乃成爲今日上海普通家庭中的惟一挹注辦決。，這樣個現象，差不多是一普遍的，說來亦至可憐。</p>
<p>今之社會福利問題莫大於減輕　平民生活負擔，而其方法則是多端的。例如，市與之設立而外，遼須有市秤之規定；以今日空前昂貴之物價，再加以不合標準的所謂「時秤」。從中剝削，吾民苦矣！本欄前曾申請標準度量衡器之重要，亦即盼望市政當局予以切實嚴厲的執行，藉以减輕人民日常生活之負擔</p>
<h3>物資調查委員會　昨開第三次會議</h3>

<p>報吿調查</p>
<p>全市倉庫物資經過情形，並查獲囤積商戶請大會決定適當之處置，旋即討論通過，　事務所組織規程，　調查官及調查員服務規則，　擴充調查員名額，並嚴厲審查調查資格，最後臨時動議，以自汲高國防會議通過收買棉紗棉布條例及實施要綱後，紗布暫行即將開始實施收買，因而市價日形降落，其他股票等價格均趨下跌，唯一般食用物品價格，則反見狂漲，關係民生影響甚鉅。</p>
<p>討論結果</p>
<p>決即日起開始調查肉類（豬肉，牛肉，鷄，及其他等）及蛋類（雞蛋，鴨蛋。皮蛋）等市價高漲原因，並請由政府嚴厲執行取締，柏聞該會一俟棉紗布調查工作全部完竣後，即將擴充調查其他主要物資云。</p>

<h3>贊成創辦敎織員合作社　並貢獻幾點意見</h3>
<p>— 上海市民福利會敎育委員會</p>
<p>到十九日申報國民論　　蔣　同君關於創辦敎織員消費合作社的建議和辦法，我們認為當局和社會上部應予以熱烈和切實的贊助。茲就我們所見抒述數飾，以俄　攷。</p>
<p>關於創辦敎織員消　合作社之迫切需要與意義，蔣君已有明瞭的解釋，據我們所知現在小學敎員的收入，約在四百元左右，大學敎授亦不過千元以上，從目前生活指數來看，即使維持其本身的生活，已經非常勉强，欲謀贍養家屬，實有岌岌共難之　。生活之重累至此，而欲求其安心敎育他人子女，培育國家人材，衡以常織，實有不忍設想者。今日國家社會對於敎育事業之需要發展，日後迫急，而敎育工作者方掙扎於生死綫上，此為保等可痛心之事。然國家之救濟，旣不能求日夕實現，則社會人士之互助，實有迫切之需要，此吾人所以必須　　贊　蔣君之文議促敎識員消費合作社之實現。</p>
<p>敎織員消費合作社的主要意義，在集資自辦日用必須物品，以合理之平價分配於和敎織員，避免了中間　人的利潤，　　經敎織員　　上的負担，如此則其工作亦可以安心，而敎育的效率心　　之提高。但這裏有待　　局及社會各界之協助者極大。第一，在合作社資金方面，照蔣群所擬辦法，自　妥善，然敎職員本身所織，為敎有限，故希望社會熟主人士及金融界方面給予協助，俾能籌集相當數量的款項。</p>
<p>第二，在消費品之　辦方面，自當以生活必需品為主，此種物品，大致已經實行配給制度，所以合作社的採買工作，在以關於敎織員正確的調查統計，提供主持物資配給的當局，　時　　當局鑒於維持敎育事業之重要意義，特別授予優先權利。就過去若干合作社的經驗而言，合作社的主持人，自須推經驗豊當及有社會上有聲響有才幹之人物，而其職權，則須明確規定，且社員得依法監督之。至於工作人員，亦宜愼重選擇，務使集中人才，集中力量。關於此點，尤盼倡導者充分汁意，勿稍輕忽</p>
<p>第三，進貨方面違反戰時生活與個人健康的消耗品如烟酒等絕對不辦。在分配方面，務求人平合理及訊速。在社員家况調查方面，延腮認眞　　　以決定其　　需要數字，而使公平分配，分配手續，更可採用學樣單位制，以該校社員若干，家屬若干，公共應配若干，由該校　領，並可依地區實行各校聯領辦法，以　省人力及時間。</p>
<p>以上組綫的意見，或早為倡導者所汁憲，聊供參考，以表贊助而已，我們提摯誠，期望有關當局及社會領導人物，以及學生家長。共同協助，使敎職員消費合作社能早日成立，敎育事業前途，必將放射無限的光明！</p>
<p>社會服務</p>
<h3>新上海應行舉辦的　社會福利事業</h3>
<p>上海人口達五百萬，其中薪給階級有勞工佔大部份，際此物價飛　之時，生活艱困已成普通之現象。租界收囘後，百端待興，有待推進之事業固多，以舉辦平民福利畫業為最緊要，本處黃驚頑主任有鑒於斯，特為倡導，深望社會各界人士，予以襄助，並分別進行，共負此重大之責任。茲將擬行舉辦之事，分別列後：</p>
<p>本小貨金處　職業指導所　街童敎養院　兒童公園　巡　圖書車　安老院　永安公墓　平民食堂　經濟喪葬處　民衆運動塲　　平民義務學校　　日用品產銷合作社　　各業職工聯歡社　　人事諮詢所　　施診所　　游民習藝所　　保健醫院　　經濟禮堂　　托兒所　　姻綠信託社　　　代筆處　　　勞工洗浴理髪堂。</p>
<p>以上祇舉犖犖大者，個人經濟精力有限，非傾社會全力創辦，不足為功，亟盼各界人士，本已飢已溺之心，為平民謀福利，使以上事業，逐步實現，則幸甚矣。</p>
<h3>鑽戒復得　失主慨捐千元</h3>
<p>盛炳記百貨店交來顧客遺失於該店之鑽戒，託為招領，已詳本報。昨有第一區公署衛生處職員高昭君，前來本館，說明當時情形及該戒式樣，確認該戒係其夫人原物。當即備保查核無誤，由荘領囘，並捐助儲券千元，充本報社會服務處潛資金，以誌謝意，並為該店及周姓職員造福。</p>
<h3>義校招生</h3>
<p>愛女義路派克路四平和里四四號壬午義務學校，招二至六年級新生，學雜費免收，即日起下午二至五時報名，八月二十三日下午二時考試。二十四日開學。</p>
<p>義務夜校定九月一日考試，五日開學，報名即日起，自小學至初中，每晚七時至九時，學校全免，酌收保證金十元，校址愛多亞路均樂邨七號光中小學內。</p>
<h3>揭發新賊</h3>
<p>據讀者某來函:有一侍者，到一敎鋼琴者處，問何時有空，其女主人欲學琴。先生坐在沙發上低者頭在看課程表，此人站在琴旁，忽云肚痛，乃引其至後面，久不出來、再去一看，已從後門走了。囘到客室發現一隻小金表和幾個學生付　的信壳不見了！友中數人均遇此類事，可見此賊專找音樂家的，會講洋涇浜。敎琴者請予注意。</p>

<h3>洋涇浜聖母院參觀記（三）</h3>
<p>婦孺救濟工作</p>
<p>聖母院善業的主要對象是婦女和孤兒。自從戰事爆發以後，無家可歸游乞於上海的，無慮千萬。其中情况最慘者，自然要算那些拖男帶女走投無路的婦女。當時洋涇浜聖母院的姆姆們，院長姆姆沐雅蒙氏，和徐姆姆潘姆姆等，目擊心傷，本着天主愛人之義，組織「雖婦救濟處」，收容難婦。一方面供給最低限度的衣食，一面敎她們一些淺技薄術，做做粗工，給一些零用。對於難婦的子女，也設法分別安挿，其中有較優秀的便送往適當學校，代付一切費用。上海局而稍定後，由於經費困難，凡有去處的，盡力資遺囘鄕，一部分留在永安街婦女部，一部分在虹橋弄育嬰堂。主持其事的潘姆姆，熱烈地講述她們救濟婦孺的工作，眞是有聲有色。</p>
<p>她說：滬戰後，上海各地難民　集、哭聲幾乎成為上海高出一切的聲浪。其中尤以受難嬰兒，無人顧惜，拋棄道側，號哭待斃，最為慘痛。聖母院主持的上海洋涇浜公敎進行會，因即請得法領事的許可，在城內難民區設立育嬰堂。二年餘以後，因為收容的嬰孩日增一日，所有房屋不敷應用，才遷至城內，租屋六幛，改名為「天主敎仁善育嬰堂」。現在城內虹橋衖內，在四面殘破的民房，瓦礫堆與曠塲上，時立的雙層磗房，便是幾經奮　才在愚難中成長的育嬰堂，他與貧孤兒童敎養院，同為洋涇浜聖母院敎養兒童的事業。負責該堂事業的潘姆姆撫着幾十隻小鐵牀裏的瘦弱的孤嬰，似乎有無限的感　。記者見每個孩子都有號碼，已到一千四百五十餘號，據說自創辦以來，經過該堂睡容轉送，死亡及領出的，共逹四千數百名。這一千四百餘名，完全是由該院撫養的人數。現在因為經費困難，收容數量，限於數十名。但沒有牛奶，沒有奶粉，只吃米湯，雖然細心看護，也不能保其健全發育啊！該堂還附設貧民小學、敎養召苦失學的子女。還有無家可歸的出獄女犯，以及迷涂流浪婦孺，也加以收容，代為謀求出路。因此虹橋弄的天主敎仁善堂，又成無告者的學校與逆旅了。</p>

<h3>Strengthening Sino-Japanese Cooperation – Welcoming Minister Aoki</h3>
<p>It has been ten months since Minister Aoki left China. During these ten months, the status of East Asia has become increasingly important. In particular, the implementation of the friendly nation Japan's new policy towards China and the development of Southeast Asian nations under Japan's leadership, coupled with the victory of the Greater East Asia War, have brought a bright future to the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Under these new circumstances today, we welcome Minister Aoki's visit with heartfelt joy and enthusiasm, which cannot be fully expressed in words.</p>
<p>According to yesterday's news reports, Minister Aoki's visit to our country is for four purposes: first, to hold sincere talks with our authorities; second, to inspect the implementation of the new policy towards China; third, to examine the activities of Japanese organizations in China; and fourth, to exchange views with friendly forces' army and navy authorities stationed in China. In short, it is to strengthen Sino-Japanese cooperation in order to complete the Greater East Asia War. We know that since Minister Aoki took office, in less than a year, he has devoted much effort, promoted with great strength, and achieved great success in the implementation of the new policy towards China, yielding unexpected results. Not long ago, Minister Aoki personally visited Southeast Asia, traveling to various places, guiding and assisting the East Asian nations, long oppressed by British and American imperialism, to become self-reliant and independent in the spirit of Greater East Asia co-prosperity and co-existence. Thailand is now celebrating the recovery of its lost territories and fulfilling its long-cherished wish; Burma's independence is about to be successfully declared with the assistance and guidance of friendly nations; and the participation of Javanese natives in politics and the independence of the Philippines are also being actively prepared. The liberation cause of the Greater East Asia nations has gradually seen the light, and the Greater East Asia Charter is being practiced implicitly. Although this is not solely due to Minister Aoki's efforts, his "hard work and high merit" are clear to every East Asian person. In particular, we, the Chinese people, recalling Minister Aoki's past contributions as an advisor to the National Government and his promotion of the new policy towards China in recent years, feel gratitude and self-reproach for not having contributed enough to the Greater East Asia War to meet the actual needs, causing us to feel apprehensive.</p>
<p>Currently, the international situation is becoming increasingly serious, urgently requiring the East Asian nations, especially China and Japan, to display a spirit of great fearlessness, and to advance from striving for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War to establishing a new world order. We must redouble our efforts, enhance the national fighting spirit, implement wartime living for the people, increase wartime production, and concentrate the nation's human and material resources in order to cooperate with friendly nations to complete the war. We must also strengthen the understanding between the Chinese and Japanese people, strengthen the cooperation between the two countries, and further unite the one billion people of East Asia to establish a new order of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere that is prosperous, strong, free, and mutually supportive. Here, we hope that everyone will work together based on the new policy of friendly nations. We sincerely wish Minister Aoki good health and success in this trip.</p>
<p>Specific Measures to Improve the Lives of Teachers and Staff</p>
<p>Since Mr. Jiang Tao-tong published his article "A Preliminary Proposal for Establishing a Teachers and Staff Consumer Cooperative in Shanghai," it has attracted considerable attention from the public. Now, the Education Committee of the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association has taken the lead in responding and supporting it (see the special article on page four of today's newspaper). We hope that this call from the Citizens' Welfare Association will attract special attention from all parties and prompt them to support and promote it, so that the establishment of a teachers and staff consumer cooperative in this city can be successful as soon as possible.</p>
<p>We news reporters have more opportunities to interact with teachers in general primary, middle, and high schools, and we know more about the sufferings of teachers and staff in their lives and in their minds. As Mr. Jiang Tao-tong said, "The income of a university professor is less than that of a rickshaw puller, and the monthly salary of an elementary school teacher is lower than that of a nanny." This tragic situation in the education field is not only entirely true, but perhaps teachers themselves feel that it does not fully describe their suffering. The gains and losses of a rickshaw puller are limited to himself and his family. Earning a few more coins or a few fewer coins only affects himself and his family. Nannies, in addition to their wages, also have extra income, and their work is limited to serving one person or one family. However, teachers not only have to invest a lot of money (in normal school and specialized education fees) and receive years of cultivation from the state, but teachers are not easily obtained and can truly be said to be the "essence" of the state and the people. Secondly, their work is closely related to the future of the nation and the people. Their position is so important and their responsibilities are so arduous, yet they are constantly困窘 by the high cost of living. This is a serious loss to the country and society. The establishment of a teachers and staff consumer cooperative can at least partially alleviate the difficulties of teachers and staff.</p>
<p>Speaking from the specific measures of the teachers and staff consumer cooperative, Mr. Jiang's article is the product of several studies and discussions by education workers, and the Education Committee of the Citizens' Welfare Association has valuable suggestions. Today, we only have the following hopes: first, the teachers and staff of each school in this city should quickly elect representatives and convene a preparatory meeting on a regular basis to discuss all matters to be carried out; second, the relevant authorities should provide the greatest support; and third, people from all walks of life should respond and assist.</p>
<p>A teachers and staff consumer cooperative is the most concrete way to improve education and improve the lives of teachers and staff today. If this matter cannot be assisted to succeed, how can any policy or plan gain the trust and support of the "teachers of all people"?</p>

<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain place in the southern Japanese military, the Japanese hospital ship Buenos Aires was illegally bombed by enemy planes in the Pacific Ocean at 5:17 a.m. on August 17. The weather was clear and visibility was good at the time. The enemy, knowing it was a hospital ship, still deliberately carried out this inhumane act. The attacking enemy aircraft were of the unified type, with the entire fuselage painted black and no markings. After dropping four bombs, they also strafed from an altitude of about 1,000 meters. This kind of tyrannical behavior by the enemy has occurred 12 times since the beginning of this year. It is reported that the hospital ship was attacked by an enemy submarine with torpedoes in the South China Sea on April 25.

I personally wish to take office immediately, but since I have been serving as the Minister of Finance since independence, I am currently working on the new budget. In view of the current economic and financial situation of Burma, the establishment of a national bank is also an urgent task at hand, so I will be able to take office at the end of September after these two urgent tasks are completed. I am willing to work hard for the cooperation between the two countries based on the spirit of the Burmese nation-building Japanese-Burmese alliance.</p>
<p>Yangon, 20th (Central News Agency) – After Burmese Finance Minister Dai Ying Mo was transferred to be the Ambassador to Japan, his vacancy was decided to be filled by the Mayor of Yangon and Advisor to the Privy Council, Shima Kizi.</p>
<h3>Japan and Thailand Sign Treaty; Four States of Malaya and Two States of Shan Ceded to Thai Territory</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 11:50 a.m. on August 20th: Between the governments of Japan and Thailand, following the meeting between the Minister of Cabinet Affairs Tojo and the Prime Minister of Thailand Phibunsongkhram on July 4th of this year, negotiations were conducted on the matter of concluding a treaty between Japan and Thailand regarding the territory of Thailand in the Malaya and Shan regions. The text of the treaty has now been drafted, and it has been signed by Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Tsubokami Hyakuji and the Prime Minister of Thailand and Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs, Marshal Phibunsongkhram.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 20th (Central News Agency) – The treaty between Japan and Thailand regarding the incorporation of northern Malaya and the Shan region into Thai territory was completed at 8:00 a.m. (Thai time) on the 20th at the residence of the Thai Prime Minister in Bangkok. Ambassador Tsubokami of Japan and Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram of Thailand signed and sealed the treaty.

Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram immediately shook hands with Ambassador Tsubokami and entered the hall together. Then, each signed and sealed one copy of the treaty in Japanese and Thai. After that, Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram gave a thank-you speech, and Ambassador Tsubokami gave a reply. The solemn signing ceremony was then successfully concluded.</p>
<p>Speech by the Prime Minister of Thailand</p>
<p>Bangkok, 20th (Central News Agency) – Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram of Thailand and Ambassador Tsubokami of Japan gave speeches at the signing ceremony of the territory transfer treaty, as follows:</p>
<p>Your Excellency Ambassador, this time, the signing of the territory transfer treaty between Japan and Thailand will add a new chapter of glory to the centuries-old friendly relations between the two countries. The friendship between the two countries is very close, and it has been growing year by year. Moreover, under the principle of mutual respect for independence, the Japan-Thailand Alliance Treaty was concluded. In the spirit of this treaty, we will cooperate and strive to build a new order in Greater East Asia together. According to the treaty signed this time, the four states of Malaya and the three states of Shan, which were forcibly occupied by the United Kingdom thirty-three years ago, will be re-incorporated into Thai territory. In addition to the joy of Thailand and its people, we deeply feel the great friendship of Japan. However, I always remember that these four states of Malaya incorporated into Thai territory were obtained by the Japanese army with blood. On this point, I feel particularly grateful.</p>
<p>Reply by the Japanese Ambassador</p>
<p>Your Excellency Prime Minister, the relationship between Japan and Thailand has always been based on trust and gratitude, without regard to interests. However, this time, the transfer of territory to Thailand is purely an expression of friendship, and it is a rare precedent in the history of world diplomacy. The friendly relations between the two countries have developed to such an extent, which is due to the absolute心 right to do so held by the peoples of both countries. Recently, Japan and the countries in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere have successively established friendship treaties. Therefore, the construction of our Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere can be put on the right track. The people of Japan have always respected the concept of acting before speaking, so the meaning of the so-called Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is deemed unnecessary to be explained in detail, and the various important policies implemented in the past and the mutual practices from now on are better than all explanations. Today, the peoples of Japan and Thailand stand on the same front. As a result of hard苦, we have exchanged for great battle achievements. However, in order to make this great battle achievement our own forever, we must bravely advance with unremitting efforts. However, in order to keep this battle achievement in our hands permanently, victory is most important. Therefore, for the sake of winning the war, the peoples of Japan and Thailand must sacrifice their personal interests and dedicate themselves to the country, overcome all the hardships, and devote all their efforts to achieve the common goal. This is the key to victory. I am very fortunate to be here today. In addition to expressing my heartfelt joy, I would also like to take this opportunity to renew my determination to win the ultimate victory.</p>
<h3>Thai Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Express Gratitude to Japan; Bangkok Celebrates Enthusiastically</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 20th (Central News Agency) – After Japan and Thailand signed the treaty on transferring the Malaya "Shan" area to Thailand, Thai Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram sent telegrams of thanks to Japanese Prime Minister Tojo and Supreme Commander Terauchi in the names of the Thai Prime Minister and the Supreme Commander of National Defense, respectively.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 20th (Central News Agency) – Thai Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram issued a statement today saying that it is truly worthy of celebration that the four states of Malaya and the two states of Shan have been formally incorporated into Thai territory. Thailand has recovered its lost territories twice since the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, and both times it has received the kind support of friendly Japan. This is beyond gratitude. The Thai military has now implemented military administration in the two Shan states. According to the treaty, Japan's administration in the four states of Malaya will end within sixty days. Thailand is currently making various preparations for the takeover. It is planned to implement military administration in these areas temporarily. Neighboring Burma is now independent, and the independence of the Philippines is also imminent. Now that Japan is assisting Thailand in expanding its territory, I believe that these facts are a manifestation of Japan's true intentions.</p>
<p>Xinjing, 20th (Central News Agency) – Thai Foreign Minister Vaddhayang, who is staying here, recently gave a statement regarding the treaty signed between Japan and Thailand on the 20th regarding the cession of six states, including Malaya and Shan, to Thai territory, saying: Thailand's long-desired land has now been fulfilled, and Thailand is beyond gratitude for Japan's kindness. This land was obtained by the Japanese army with blood and flesh, and now it is owned by Thailand, entirely out of Japan's kindness. Today, the national flags of Japan and Thailand are hoisted all over Thailand, and the masses are celebrating enthusiastically. Although I am currently residing in Manchuria, I am deeply pleased for the joy and glory of my motherland and for the two countries, Japan and Thailand.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 20th (Central News Agency) – After the signing of the Japan-Thailand territory transfer treaty on the 20th, the Thai government and various agencies, companies, and schools launched expanded celebrations. In addition, the national flags of Japan and Thailand were flown from door to door throughout the country. The public and the Thai army held a victory parade on Victory Street. At 4:00 p.m., Thai Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram hosted a dinner party for Japanese-Thai related personnel and Axis diplomats at the Prime Minister's official residence. Celebrations were also held separately throughout the country. After this, the cooperation between Japan and Thailand will be further strengthened, and the determination to complete the Greater East Asia War will also be strengthened.</p>
<p>Overview of the Six States</p>
<p>Bangkok, 20th (Central News Agency) – An overview of the four Malayan states and two Shan states that have been newly incorporated into Thailand is as follows: The two Shan states are currently under the rule of the Thai National Defense Forces, so there will be no changes in the nature of the states after the treaty is signed. The four northern Malayan states have been under the political control of the Japanese army. Based on this treaty, although these four states have been incorporated into Thai territory, in order to avoid sudden changes, it was decided to gradually transfer administrative power to Thailand within sixty days. The specific matters can be agreed upon by the Thai officials. The four northern Malayan states, namely Ding Runu, Ji Lengdan, Jida, and Borlis, were formerly Thai territories. In 1909, due to the violent oppression of the United Kingdom, Thailand abandoned the sovereignty of the four states. Most of the residents of these places are Thai, with a total population of 820,000, namely 150,000 in Dinggalu, 300,000 in Ji Lengdan, 340,000 in Jida, and more than 30,000 in Borlis. The total area of the four states is about 18,000 square miles. The residents are very happy and grateful to return to their homeland. Jingdong and Mengban states have close political and economic relations with Thailand. Jingdong state is adjacent to Yunnan, Myanmar, Vietnam, and other places in China, with an area of 12,000 square miles and a population of 220,000. Mengban state is south of Jingdong state, with an area of 2,800 square miles and a population of 22,000. The residents are all Tribe people, and are now under the administration of the Thai National Defense Forces. There are temporary state governors, judicial organs, and so on, and various administrations have been very good.</p>
<h3>Full Text of the Japan-Thailand Treaty</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – The full text of the Japan-Thailand Treaty is as follows: Treaty between the Empire of Japan and the Kingdom of Thailand regarding the territory of Thailand in Malaya and the Shan region. The Government of the Empire of Japan and the Government of the Kingdom of Thailand, with a firm determination to closely cooperate in completing the joint war against Britain and the United States and building a Greater East Asia based on morality, conclude the treaty as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1 The Empire of Japan recognizes that Thailand incorporates the states of Gi Lengdan, Dinggalu, Gida, and Borlis and their affiliated islands into its territory.</p>
<p>Article 2 The Empire of Japan recognizes that Thailand incorporates the two states of Jingdong and Mengban in the Shan region into its territory.</p>
<p>Article 3 The Empire of Japan shall cease its current activities in the areas prescribed in the previous two articles within sixty days from the date of implementation of this treaty.</p>
<p>Article 4 The areas prescribed in Article 1 and Article 2 shall be based on the state borders on the date of signature of this treaty.</p>
<p>Article 5 The steps necessary to implement this treaty shall be determined by consultation between the competent authorities of the two countries.</p>
<p>Article 6 This treaty shall be implemented from the date of signing.</p>
<h3>Statement by the National Government Authorities Regarding the Conclusion of the Japan-Thailand Treaty</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) – After the announcement of the agreement between Japan and Thailand to transfer the Malaya Shan region to Thailand, a reporter from the Central News Agency visited a government spokesperson and received the following statement of the government's views in the form of a conversation: "Today, Japan and Thailand concluded a treaty on territorial adjustment in the capital of Thailand. Judging from the original text of the treaty and the facts of the process, the friendly nation Japan has not only lofty ideals and far-reaching ambitions for the liberation of the East Asian nations and the construction of a new order in East Asia, but also a firm determination and sufficient strength to realize these ideals and is determined to implement all commitments. The Japan-Thailand territorial treaty is one example. In addition, such actions as returning [Concession locations] to our country, abandoning extraterritorial rights, realizing the independence of Burma, assisting the independence of the Philippines, and assisting the Indian revolution, are all sufficient to demonstrate its lofty moral spirit and the practice of its promise to liberate the East Asian nations. This point is not only the spirit that a moral country should have, but it also happens to prove the purpose of this war, and it also reflects the inferior behavior of Britain and the United States, who do not keep their promises. Its influence must be that the East Asian nations are harmonious and friendly, cooperating and united, 同生共死 in the spirit of 共死全东亚,</p>
<h3>German Forces Concentrated on Eastern Front, Preparing Counteroffensive; 2,000 Soviet Planes Destroyed in Summer</h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - A Hai Tong News Agency military dispatch from Seltorius reports that the main battles on the Eastern Front are still taking place in the areas of Voronezh and Kharkov. Soviet forces have increased the use of reserve units in this area. Soviet forces in the Izium area, within the Donets River region, have also attempted breakthroughs, but both attempts have failed. East of Kharkov, Soviet attacks have been particularly fierce, achieving some minor strategic successes, but they have not been able to develop into major advances due to the excellent German defenses. North of Kharkov and around Belgorod, Soviet forces have also increased pressure, while German counter-pressure has also intensified. Significant successes are expected in the major tank battles with German forces, cutting off the protruding Soviet units. West of Orel, Soviet forces are conducting reconnaissance activities against weaker German positions and concentrating a large number of troops, preparing to attack Bryansk again. On both sides of the Moscow-Smolensk railway line, Soviet attacks have been ineffective, suffering losses and retreating. The fighting is now in a stalemate. The offensive at Lake Ilmen has also failed. German forces are now concentrating, preparing for a counteroffensive, the effectiveness of which can be foreseen.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - The German Air Force announced yesterday that a total of 2,000 Soviet planes have been shot down since the start of the summer campaign.</p>

<h3>Hull and Eden Participate in Quebec Conference</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) - Roosevelt, Churchill, and Eden continued their talks yesterday. Hull arrived in Quebec last night, accompanied by State Department political advisor Mr. Dunn. It is reported that Roosevelt, Churchill, and Eden discussed proposed supplements to the Atlantic Charter. It is also expected that a decision will be made at the conference regarding the acceptance of Yugoslavia's demands, but detailed matters, such as border determinations, will have to be resolved after the war. Military issues will also be discussed at the conference. It is reported that the plan for aerial invasion must first be agreed upon by Roosevelt and Churchill, and then Eden will go to Moscow to consult with the Soviets. It is believed that the Allied offensive in Europe will be commanded by a British general, while Eisenhower will remain responsible for operations in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Discussion of Military and Political Strategies</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 20th (Central News Agency) - British Foreign Secretary Eden met with Churchill and Roosevelt until late into the night on the 18th, and then again on the morning of the 19th for several hours of further discussions. It is said that the topic of discussion was the strategy against the Axis powers. A Reuters correspondent revealed that the outcome of this meeting may clarify the following matters: A new declaration regarding the maintenance of the Atlantic Charter; A statement regarding the wartime and future relationship between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Quebec, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a Hai Tong News Agency dispatch: British Foreign Secretary Eden, accompanied by Minister of Information Bracken, immediately visited Churchill upon arrival and began the conference, which was still in progress at the time of the dispatch. The fact that Eden was accompanied by the Minister of Information further increases the impression that this conference is more political than military in nature. The members of Eden and Bracken's entourage are not making many statements, indicating the military nature of the conference. Furthermore, there are very few British and American diplomats who have arrived here, suggesting that there will not be major political decisions. However, some people believe that political issues are also very pressing and that the British and American leaders cannot ignore them. Issues such as the declaration of Rome as an undefended city and the recognition of the Tergortiau Committee have been mentioned.</p>

<h3>German Planes Vigorously Attack Bizerte Harbor, Destroying 100,000 Tons of Enemy Shipping</h3>
<p>German Forces Completely Destroy Military Facilities on Sicily</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a Hai Tong News Agency dispatch: German bomber squadrons again attacked ships concentrated in the port of Bizerte on Wednesday evening, with at least twelve ships hit directly. Regarding the details of the German air raid there on Tuesday evening, the following has been learned: German planes attacked the targets in waves in the evening and under the moonlight. Enemy anti-aircraft fire was very intense, and the enemy also attempted to use artificial fog to conceal the harbor. At the same time, there were many barrage balloons blocking the targets, and searchlights were also very active. As a result, German planes were still able to damage 37 medium-sized ships, estimated at 100,000 tons, severely disrupting the enemy's supply to Sicily.</p>
<p>Geneva, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a correspondent for the York Daily Mail: The Axis forces thoroughly destroyed the military facilities on Sicily, preventing the Allied forces from advancing smoothly.

<h3>Axis Nations Intensify Connections; Britain and the United States Engage in Extensive and Cunning Propaganda; Next Stage of Operations Becomes Pie in the Sky</h3>
<p>In the current state of the European war theater, the Axis countries are not faring well in either political or military terms. Soviet forces have recovered Orel on the central front and are approaching Kharkov. On the Sicilian front, Axis forces have retreated from the entire island. In this situation, Britain and the United States are engaging in extensive and cunning propaganda to disrupt the Axis rear areas and boost the morale of their own people. We should be aware that the purpose of this British and American propaganda is, first, to incite anti-government sentiment among the German and Italian people; and second, to undermine the strong ties between the Axis countries.</p>
<p>Since the Casablanca Conference, British and American propaganda seems to have reached its peak. Let us introduce an example:</p>
<p>The British and American side has recently been reporting daily on the unrest in Italy, saying that anti-government movements by the Italian people are surging in northern Italian cities such as Milan, Turin, and Genoa. According to a New York telegram on the 10th, the Italian General Confederation of Labor and the Socialist Party launched a general strike, with strikers demanding an immediate end to the war and appealing to Britain and the United States to respect the rights of the Italian people.</p>
<p>Regarding the above-mentioned inflammatory propaganda from the British and American side, a Spanish diplomat stationed in Rome, who returned to Barcelona by plane on the 9th, elucidated the truth about the internal situation in Italy, saying:</p>
<p>"The Italian people, from top to bottom, are united and obedient to the leadership of Marshal Badoglio."</p>
<p>From the above remarks, it is clear that the Italian people have abandoned their individualistic tendencies and are filled with fervent patriotism. The British and American propaganda is entirely fictitious. According to reports from Berlin, although posters calling for a general strike were plastered all over Milan, Turin, and Genoa, they had no effect. Recent foreign dispatches reported that there were neither strikes nor pro-peace demonstrations in the above three cities, showing that the news broadcast by the British and American side is completely fabricated.</p>
<p>Now that their propaganda against Italy has been ineffective, Britain and the United States have turned their guns towards Germany. A London report on the 10th said:</p>
<p>"Hitler has already lost his former omnipotence. A violent revolution is now inevitable."</p>
<p>However, this report was followed by a caveat stating that the rumor that Hitler had lost power had not been confirmed, and that Hitler still held a firm position in Germany. A London dispatch on the 10th also stated:</p>
<p>"Sweden's halting of German troops from passing through its territory is a bold challenge to German power. It also shows that Sweden has long ceased to be subservient to Germany."</p>
<p>It also said: "In Southern Europe and the Balkan countries, the leaders of Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, who are eager to withdraw from the war, are trying to conclude some kind of agreement with each other so that they can smoothly escape the vortex of war." This kind of British and American propaganda is recorded repeatedly in the anti-Axis and neutral newspapers every day. Germany and Italy, amidst this stereotypical propaganda, are not relaxing their vigilance against the second stage of British and American operations, and are paying close attention to them. The reason why Germany is retreating from the German-Soviet front is to prepare the front line to cope with the new situation in Europe. Regarding the next stage of operations by the British and American forces, the following three locations can be generally mentioned:</p>
<p>The Italian mainland - British and American forces seem likely to directly attack the Italian mainland, but whether they will implement this move before occupying Sardinia and Corsica is questionable.</p>
<p>Greece - The British and Americans plan to invade Greece with a large army after the end of the Sicilian campaign, but at this time they cannot but land on Crete.</p>
<p>Southern coast of France - Some observers believe that the British and American forces may choose to land on a certain coastal area in southern France. Whether the Allied forces dare to skillfully carry out such a bold amphibious assault is a real question. The German and Italian military authorities have already secretly prepared everything to cope with the future British and American landings.</p>
<p>For example, regarding Field Marshal Rommel, the commander of the Balkan defense forces, there is the following news:</p>
<p>Under his command, four new and elite tank divisions have been added, and air bases are being actively constructed to prepare for the imminent strengthening of the air force. According to recent reports from the Balkans, Germany is overcoming all difficulties to secure Greece and other Balkan regions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Moscow's call for a second front is becoming increasingly intense. Even if Britain and the United States look at the Soviet Union with suspicion as usual, they cannot but formulate some kind of countermeasure to deal with it.</p>
<p>To be frank, the situation in Europe is that Germany and Italy are currently encountering unfavorable circumstances and are standing on the defensive. However, the subtle mutual relationship between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union is a headache for the British and American side. In this situation, we cannot say that Britain and the United States will not suffer major setbacks in the end. Therefore, the people of Japan, Germany, and Italy should rely on the close cooperation of the three countries and not allow the enemy's divisive propaganda to find an opportunity. The coordination of the Axis countries and each country's adherence to its domestic front are the only ways to win this world war. (From the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, August 14th).</p>

<p>The Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy held its routine press conference for the Chinese journalists of the city at 3:00 PM yesterday on the fifth floor of the Astor House Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road. The Embassy was represented by General Affairs Minister Okazaki and Vice Consul Fukuma, among others. Minister Okazaki explained the Guomindang government's purchase of cotton yarn and cloth as follows: Minister Okazaki first stated that "Many Chinese and Japanese merchants in Shanghai have registered with the General Chamber of Commerce for this purchase of cotton yarn and cloth by the Guomindang government, and it is said that there are still one-fifth who have not registered. The monthly production of cotton cloth in Shanghai is currently estimated to be about 110,000 to 200,000 bales." He then said that, according to statistics, the average amount of cotton cloth needed by the general public in Shanghai is about 10 yards per person per year, and the period for distribution will not be far off. Mr. Okazaki continued that, although there are no statistics on the cotton yarn and cloth inventory in the five provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and the two cities of Shanghai and Nanjing, it is said that the quantity is 800,000 to 1,000,000 bales. Finally, Mr. Okazaki provided a detailed explanation of the currency issue. As Mr. Okazaki is a famous Japanese economist who has studied world economics for a long time, he made many grand pronouncements on economic issues during the session yesterday.</p>

<h3>Spokesperson for the Japanese Army Speaks Yesterday</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai - The spokesperson for the Shanghai Japanese Army stated the following when meeting with the press corps yesterday (20th) regarding the lack of unity in the Chongqing anti-Japanese front:</p>
<p>Army Press Director Guqi of the General Headquarters quoted the editorials of the Central Daily News and Ta Kung Pao on the Roosevelt-Churchill Quebec Conference on the 19th, and pointed out that the reward for Britain and the United States for Chongqing's six years of resistance was not weapons but destruction. Now, I will further explain the divisions and oppositions in opinions on the world war situation within the Chongqing anti-Japanese front that are exposed in the aforementioned editorials of the Central Daily News and Ta Kung Pao. The editorials of the two newspapers published on the 17th were both speculative essays expressing Chongqing's views on the Roosevelt-Churchill Quebec Conference. The Central Daily News attempted to defend Stalin's non-participation in the Quebec Conference, but Ta Kung Pao always followed the lead of British and American propaganda and wrote--- In the editorials of the Central Daily News, there was a saying: "The reason why the Soviet representative did not participate in the meeting is because the meeting was regarded as one dedicated to discussing East Asian issues, but Japan and the Soviet Union have not yet entered a state of war." Detailed explanation was given to Stalin's position, and the hope of the Chongqing Kuomintang side was frankly revealed that the focus of the meeting was on the East Asian war situation. However, Ta Kung Pao believed that the main agenda of the meeting was to deal with Italy after Mussolini stepped down, or to discuss the European landing operation after the fall of Sicily, that is, to open a second European front, and issued a warning saying: East Asian issues cannot be taken lightly, but the result is still a conclusion of Europe First. The division of views between the two newspapers is more important when viewed from the perspective of the two newspapers' characteristics. One point is even more worthy of attention, and this is also the opposition between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, that is, between Chongqing and Yan'an, on the world war situation.</p>
<p>Recently, Chongqing has advocated the Pacific War First policy, making the defeat of Japan a prerequisite, and emphasizing the importance of the Chinese mainland as a base for counter-offensive against Japan, as well as the need to provide Chongqing with military supplies. However, Yan'an still bases itself on the Soviet Union's position, advocating the Europe First policy, and making every effort to advocate opening a second front. This can also be clearly seen in the "July 7th Declaration" of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. As mentioned above, within the Chongqing anti-Japanese front, the positions of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are different, and they are in opposition to each other. Moreover, this kind of divergence is not only on the world war situation, but also on all kinds of issues.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Press Friendship Gathering Today</h3>

<h3>How to Construct the New Shanghai After Taking Back the Concessions: A Speech at the Youth Corps Summer Training Camp</h3>
<p>— Chen Gongbo</p>
<p>Now that the two concessions in Shanghai have been taken back, the administration of Shanghai can be unified. It seems that the ideal construction of the new Shanghai can be started and carried out smoothly. However, there are still many unnatural facts existing in Shanghai. For example, taking the area as an example, Shanghai still has three regions. The first region is the Shanghai Special Region, which includes Baoshan, Jiading, , Nanhui, Chuansha, Beiqiao, and Chongming. These areas were formerly counties of Jiangsu Province. According to the established practice of urban expansion, the development of the urban area should expand according to the development of industry and commerce. In my observation, industry and commerce will not develop to these places even after a hundred years. In the future, after the general situation in Shanghai is stable, we will return these special regions to Jiangsu Province. The second region is the second to seventh districts. These are ordinary districts, which are what we used to call the city center, Hubei, Fuxi, Pudong North District, Pudong South District, and Nanshi. We expect that industry and commerce will soon prosper in these places, and they will be changed to district offices, directly under the administration of the various bureaus of the municipal government. The third region is the first and eighth districts, which were formerly the Public Concession and the French Concession. Although they are currently called ordinary districts, because of their huge organizations, it is not easy to shrink them. We have to temporarily maintain the status quo to unify them slowly.</p>
<p>First Merge Districts One and Eight</p>
<p>Regarding the unified plan for the famous districts, we plan to start with the first and eighth districts first, because the facilities in these two districts are roughly the same. Therefore, it is planned to merge the first and eighth districts within six months. However, the so-called similarity between the first and eighth districts only refers to the facilities. There are still many differences between them. In terms of system, the highest decision-making power in the former Public Concession was in the hands of the Municipal Council, and the Public Works Department was only an executive agency. The Municipal Council was like a parliament, and the Public Works Department was like a cabinet. In the former French Concession, the power was in the hands of the French Consul General, and the Municipal Council was like an advisory body. Secondly, the police in the Public Concession were under the jurisdiction of the Public Works Department, while the police in the French Concession were independent of the Public Works Department and were under the command of the French Consul General. In terms of the burden on the people, the Public Concession and the French Concession had many differences. The types of taxes were different. Even the treatment of the employees of the two concessions was different in the past. It is obvious that foreigners in the French Concession had higher salaries than those in the Public Concession, while the Chinese had lower . French employees had retirement benefits but no annual , while the Public Concession had regulations similar to the civil service system. Therefore, to unify Shanghai's administration, we must first start with unifying the systems of the first and eighth districts. Therefore, today there are still districts one and eight, and there are also three police stations, the first, second, and third, which is the reason for this. We hope to merge the first and third police stations within three months and merge the first and eighth districts within six months. As for completely unifying Shanghai, I am afraid it will take a considerable period of time, depending on the development of industry and commerce and the ability of the people to bear the burden. Without increasing the burden on the people in each district, there will be a distinction between light and heavy within a district. If the burden on the people is increased, it is feared that the people will not be able to bear it. These are all points to consider when planning.</p>
<p>No Need to Worry About the Progress of the Project</p>
<p>Now that the main points of administration have been discussed, it is time to talk about engineering issues. The most important thing in a city is engineering. Therefore, many small cities in foreign countries have engineers as mayors, because if the city buildings are not good, the roads are not solid, the electricity and water supply are not good, the trams, telephones, and other transportation tools are inconvenient, and the public health facilities are not complete, no matter how good the municipal administration is, it is a lie. Shanghai's various facilities are large-scale. However, due to the division between the municipal government and the two concessions, they cannot be unified and are limited by the boundaries, so they cannot progress. In the future, with the continued prosperity of industry and commerce, there is no need to worry about the progress of the project.</p>
<p>In today's Shanghai, I think there are not many problems with municipal administration. What I am most worried about is the people's hearts and customs in Shanghai. Today, I want to tell you about a few issues that I think must be reformed. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Replacement of the Japanese Naval Attaché in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mr. Oka Shin Transfers to an Important Position; Mr. Kondo Taiichiro Succeeds Him</p>
<p>Mr. Oka Shin, the Japanese Naval Attaché in Shanghai, has been honorably transferred to an important position, and Mr. Kondo Taiichiro from a certain field has been appointed to fill his vacancy. Mr. Oka Shin recently issued a departure speech stating: I have been ordered to transfer to another position today and will leave Shanghai internally. During my tenure of one year and nine months, I have successively experienced the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army's entry into the concessions, China's participation in the war, and the return of the concessions. None of these were not epoch-making events in history. Looking back on the past, I am deeply moved. During my tenure, I have been able to complete my mission without making mistakes, thanks to the encouragement and cooperation of officials and civilians of both China and Japan. I am extremely grateful for this. However, as the situation becomes more complex, I hope that the people of China and Japan will share the spirit of living and dying together to complete the mission of the Greater East Asia War.</p>

<p>Comments from the Economic Circle</p>
<h3>Municipal Pawnshop</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Welfare Bureau of this city believes that the interest rates on pawnshops in the urban area are too high, which directly and indirectly affects the social economy. Therefore, it has presented a request to the municipal government to establish a municipal pawnshop in order to universally regulate the economy of the common people. The Municipal Pawnshop in Nanshi has been officially opened on a scheduled basis. Such a small measure is indeed related to social welfare issues. Because the economy of the common people can be circulated from this, and the burden of life will not be overly increased, it is still a way to solve the livelihood of the common people. We all know that since the continuous rise in prices, not only the general public cannot but maintain their lives through pledging, but even people in the water class cannot rely on their limited income to cope with unlimited prices. Therefore, the pledging and sale of clothing have become the only source of revenue in ordinary families in Shanghai today. This phenomenon is almost universal, and it is quite pitiful to say.</p>
<p>Today's social welfare issue is nothing more than reducing the living burden of the common people, and the methods are diverse. For example, in addition to the establishment of municipal pawnshops, there must be regulations for municipal scales; with today's unprecedentedly high prices, coupled with the substandard so-called "time scales," the people suffer from exploitation! This column has previously applied for the importance of standard weights and measures, and also hopes that the municipal authorities will implement them in a practical and strict manner in order to reduce the burden of daily life for the people.</p>
<h3>Materials Investigation Committee Held its Third Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Materials Investigation Committee held its third committee meeting at 3:00 pm yesterday (20th) at its office.</p>
<p>Attending Committee Members</p>
<p>Mayor Chen Gongbo, Secretary-General Zhao Yue, Business Supervision Director Chen Yunwen, Economic Bureau Director Wang Zhigang, Police Bureau Director Lu Ying, Japanese committee members Minister Tajiri, Consul General Yano, Inagaki Noboru, Yamazaki Naokichi, Fukuchi Shigeo, etc. Attendees included Office Director Mei Xunan, Secretary Director Zhu Zhifang, Investigation Officer Feng Yixian, Captain Anan, etc. Chairman Mayor Chen, after reporting the significance of this meeting, the investigation officer</p>
<p>Reported on the Investigation</p>
<p>The general situation of materials in warehouses throughout the city and the disposal of hoarding merchants found were requested to be decided by the general assembly, and the organizational regulations of the office, the service regulations for investigation officers and investigators, the expansion of the number of investigators, and the strict review of investigation qualifications were discussed and passed. Finally, a temporary motion was made that since the High National Defense Conference passed the regulations on the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth and the outline for implementation, the temporary purchase of yarn and cloth will soon begin to be implemented, so the market price is falling daily, and the prices of other stocks are also trending downward. However, the prices of general food items have increased drastically, which is of great importance to the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Discussion Results</p>
<p>It was decided that an investigation into the reasons for the high market prices of meat (pork, beef, chicken, and others) and eggs (chicken eggs, duck eggs, preserved eggs, etc.) will be launched from today, and the government will be requested to strictly enforce the crackdown. It is rumored that the association will expand the investigation of other major materials after the investigation of cotton yarn and cloth is completed.</p>
<h3>Special Business Tax on Shredded Paper Has Been Officially Levied</h3>
<p>Special Business Tax on Paper in this City.</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Finance Bureau presented the request to the Municipal Government for approval to levy the tax, tax revenue has been strong. It is learned that Mr. Zhou Zhihuan, the director of the collection office, recently received an order to levy a special business tax on shredded paper, which has been levied since the 4th of this month. However, at the beginning of the levy, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no incidents of tax evasion and resistance from shredded paper merchants. Therefore, the Municipal Finance Bureau yesterday sent a special letter to the Second Police Bureau of the city to assist in order to facilitate the process and enrich the treasury.</p>
<h3>After the Establishment of Various Industry Associations, They Actively Develop Association Affairs</h3>
<p>The city's major and minor trade associations have all reorganized and established themselves one after another in accordance with the orders of the competent authorities. Since April of this year, a total of about 200 associations have been reorganized. It is learned that since the establishment of each association, they have spared no effort in developing association affairs. At present, the organizational aspects of all work have been completed. In the future, association affairs will gradually become concrete and will be promoted step by step according to the following points, giving full play to the functions of the association:</p>
<p>Request the relevant authorities to fully allocate raw materials and finished products and approve the issuance of movement permits to facilitate transportation. Establish an evaluation committee as soon as possible for those who have not yet established one, and strengthen its organization to engage in evaluating the prices of members' products and reviewing the quality of their products. Investigate whether the association's daily operations are normal and legal. Study how to improve and promote members' products. Mediate misunderstandings and disputes between members so that each member is closely linked and work together in harmony. Request protection of the normal rights and interests of members from relevant parties. Obtain the fuel necessary for members to manufacture goods and distribute it evenly. Handle members' welfare undertakings, such as setting up schools, clinics, etc.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Office of the Materials Control Review Committee Will Be Established</h3>
<p>The Materials Control Review Committee, in order to facilitate materials control review affairs and contact the National Commercial Control Association, has decided to establish a Shanghai office and appointed Shen Liangzhao as the director of the office and Chen Guangzhong as the deputy director. Since actively preparing, it was originally scheduled to be officially established in the middle of this month. However, due to the fact that the site had not yet been completed and preparations were not complete, it was postponed until now. According to inquiries, after urging preparations, the office has been basically completed and will be announced for establishment next week.</p>
<h3>Trend of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks were in a falling trend. In the morning, they showed a different downward trend. By noon, the falling trend subsided, and the ground suddenly became solid. This was because each stock had fallen too much, and those with real strength absorbed the full amount. The long-weakened people's hearts were greatly stabilized. The textile industry is still weak. Yong'an Textile was closed down again. Dasheng One, Two, and Three Factories each fell sharply. Meyer's entry into the major market is still in the process of dumping. Xinhuo Communications is approaching half of the market, and Wuhuo, Guoguang, Lunhua, Hongsheng, and Dachunghua Weaving are even less popular. In the department store industry, Yong'an fell by more than , and there were no buyers for domestic goods. Jinglun shirts and socks were trading at the market price. Jinglun fell inside the market, and it was not easy to sell. In the new medicine industry, Zhongfa and Qin H.S.I. each retreated, and Wuzhou also approached the edge of the major market. Xin Xing and Xin had limited declines and were relatively stable. Dachunghua Match and Nanyang Tobacco Company each fell ××. In the public utility industry, Zhabei Water and Electricity. China Merchants Electric Public Electric Motor, etc., had the smallest decline. In the cultural industry, the World Book Company alone saw a steady half, and the Commercial Press. China saw setbacks. Yongxiang Printing, Jingfeng Paper, and Standard Paper Products all lacked transactions. Kangyuan Canned Food fell into the fire market, Standard MSG was flat and tired, and Jiuan Industry. Xinya Construction fell in many markets. China and Guohua Investment both lacked interest. The real estate industry saw lower prices and there were still buyers, which is why the industry is uniquely in a good development phase and is not restricted. Although it also declined, the number was not large. Other miscellaneous stocks had few transactions. Prices were generally lower, and each stock had recovered slightly in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Non-Major Commodity Associations Are Permitted to Temporarily Maintain the Status Quo</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Food believes that in order to facilitate both national policy and commercial sentiment in the control of food and the organization of non-major commodity industry associations, it has telegraphed the food bureaus of each province and city to allow them to maintain the current status of their existing associations. All internal organizations shall be supervised and ordered to adjust by the relevant bureaus at any time in accordance with current laws and regulations.</p>

<h3>Supporting the Establishment of a Teachers and Staff Cooperative and Contributing Some Opinions</h3>
<p>— Education Committee of the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association</p>
<p>Upon reading Mr. Jiang Tong's suggestion and methods regarding the establishment of a teachers and staff consumer cooperative in the "National Forum" of the Shen Bao on the 19th, we believe that the authorities and the upper class of society should give it enthusiastic and practical support. Now, we will express some of our views for your consideration.</p>
<p>Regarding the urgent need and significance of establishing a consumer cooperative for teachers and staff, Mr. Jiang has already given a clear explanation. According to our knowledge, the income of primary school teachers is about 400 yuan, and even university professors are no more than 1,000 yuan. Judging from the current cost of living index, it is already very difficult to maintain their own lives, let alone support their families. The heavy burden of life is so great that if we want them to educate other people's children and cultivate national talents with peace of mind, it is unbearable to think about it from the perspective of common sense. Today, the need for the development of education in the country and society is becoming increasingly urgent, while educators are struggling on the line of life and death. This is something that everyone should find distressing. However, since national relief cannot be realized overnight, mutual assistance from people in society is urgently needed. This is why we must support Mr. Jiang's article and promote the realization of the teachers and staff consumer cooperative.</p>
<p>The main significance of the teachers and staff consumer cooperative lies in raising funds to run daily necessities by themselves and distributing them to teachers and staff at reasonable prices, avoiding the profits of middlemen and easing the burden of teachers and staff on . In this way, they can also work with peace of mind, and the efficiency of education will be improved. However, here, the assistance of the authorities and all sectors of society is extremely important. First, in terms of cooperative funding, Mr. Jiang's proposed method is appropriate, but the amount provided by the teachers and staff themselves is limited. Therefore, we hope that social celebrities and financial circles will provide assistance so that a considerable amount of funds can be raised.</p>
<p>Second, in terms of the of consumer goods, it should be based on daily necessities. These items have been generally implemented with the rationing system. Therefore, the purchasing work of the cooperative should be based on accurate investigation and statistics of the teachers and staff, and provide them to the authorities in charge of material distribution. The authorities, in view of the important significance of maintaining education, shall grant preferential rights. Judging from the experience of some cooperatives in the past, the principals of the cooperative must promote people with abundant experience and social prestige and talent, and their powers must be clearly stipulated, and the members must supervise them according to law. As for the staff, they should also be selected carefully so that they can concentrate talents and strength. Regarding this point, we especially hope that the promoters will pay full attention to it and not take it lightly.</p>
<p>Third, in terms of imports, do not handle consumables that violate wartime life and personal health, such as tobacco and alcohol. In terms of distribution, strive for equality, rationality, and speed. In terms of the investigation of the members' family situation, seriously investigate to determine the required numbers for equitable distribution. The distribution procedure can also adopt the school unit system, with each school being responsible for the number of members, the number of family members, and the number of public allocations.</p>
<p>The above suggestions for organization may have been anticipated by the promoters, and are provided for reference only to express support. We sincerely hope that the relevant authorities, social leaders, and students' parents will work together to assist so that the teachers and staff consumer cooperative can be established as soon as possible, and the future of education will surely radiate infinite light!</p>

<h3>Social Welfare Undertakings to Be Undertaken in the New Shanghai</h3>
<p>Shanghai has a population of 5 million, of which wage earners and laborers account for the majority. At a time when prices are soaring, the hardship of life has become a common phenomenon. After the recovery of the concessions, everything is waiting to be done, and there are many undertakings waiting to be promoted, with the undertaking of common people's welfare projects being the most important. Mr. Huang Jingwan, director of this office, in view of this, especially advocates, and deeply hopes that people from all walks of life will provide assistance and proceed separately to share this important responsibility. The proposed undertakings are listed separately as follows:</p>
<p>Petty Loan Office Vocational Guidance Center Street Children's Home Children's Park Patrol Library Car Nursing Home Yong'an Public Cemetery Common People's Cafeteria Economic Funeral Service Public Sports Ground Common People's Compulsory School Daily Necessities Production and Sales Cooperative Joint Staff Association for Various Industries Personnel Consultation Office Clinic Vagrant Skills Training Center Health Care Hospital Economic Auditorium Day Care Center Marriage Trust Company Agency Labor Bathing and Hairdressing Hall.</p>
<p>The above are only a few of the major items. Individual economic power and energy are limited. Without the full power of society to establish them, it is not enough to achieve success. It is urgently hoped that people from all walks of life will, with the heart of being hungry and drowning, seek welfare for the common people and gradually realize the above undertakings. This is fortunate.</p>

<h3>New Thief Exposed</h3>
<p>According to a letter from a reader: There is a waiter who went to a piano teacher's place, asking when the teacher was available, saying that his mistress wanted to learn piano. The teacher was sitting on the sofa, looking down at the schedule. This person stood beside the piano and suddenly said he had a stomach ache, and was led to the back, but did not come out for a long time. When checked, he had left through the back door. Upon returning to the living room, a small gold watch and several envelopes of tuition fees paid by students were missing! Several friends have encountered similar incidents.

<h3>A Visit to the Yangjingbang Sacred Heart Convent (3)</h3>
<p>Relief Work for Women and Children</p>
<p>The main beneficiaries of the Sacred Heart Convent's charitable work are women and orphans. Since the outbreak of the war, countless people have become homeless beggars in Shanghai. Among them, the most tragic situation is naturally those women who, dragging their sons and daughters along, have no way to go. At that time, the nuns of the Yangjingbang Sacred Heart Convent, including Mother Superior Mu Yameng, Sister Xu, and Sister Pan, witnessed this with heartache. Based on the Catholic principle of loving one's neighbor, they organized the "Refugee Women's Relief Center" to take in refugee women. On the one hand, they provided the bare minimum of food and clothing, and on the other hand, they taught them some basic skills and handicrafts, providing them with some pocket money. For the children of the refugee women, they also tried to arrange separate accommodations, sending the more promising ones to appropriate schools and paying all expenses. After the situation in Shanghai stabilized somewhat, due to financial difficulties, they did their best to help those who had a place to go return to their hometowns, with some remaining in the women's department on Yong'an Street and some in the nursery on Hongqiao Lane. Sister Pan, who was in charge, enthusiastically recounted their work in rescuing women and children, which was truly moving.</p>
<p>She said: After the Shanghai battle, refugees gathered everywhere in Shanghai, and the sound of crying almost became the loudest sound in Shanghai. Among them, the most tragic was the sight of suffering infants, uncared for, abandoned by the roadside, crying and awaiting death. The Shanghai Yangjingbang Catholic Action Association, which was run by the Sacred Heart Convent, immediately obtained permission from the French Consul to establish a nursery in the refugee area in the city. After more than two years, because the number of babies being taken in increased day by day, all the buildings were insufficient, so they moved to the city, renting six buildings and renaming it "Catholic Benevolent Nursery." Now, in the city's Hongqiao Lane, among the dilapidated houses, rubble piles, and open spaces, the two-story brick building that stands tall is the nursery that has grown amidst hardship after many struggles. Together with the orphanage for poor and orphaned children, it is part of the Yangjingbang Sacred Heart Convent's work in educating and caring for children. Sister Pan, who is in charge of the nursery, stroked the frail orphans in the dozens of small iron beds, seemingly filled with infinite emotion. The reporter saw that each child had a number, already exceeding 1,450. It is said that since its establishment, the nursery has cared for, transferred, seen die, and had adopted out a total of over 4,000 children. These 1,400-plus children are the total number currently being cared for by the convent. Currently, due to financial difficulties, the number of children taken in is limited to several dozen. But without milk and without milk powder, they only eat rice porridge. Although they are carefully cared for, their healthy development cannot be guaranteed! The nursery also has an attached elementary school for poor children, educating the children of those who have suffered and lost their education. It also takes in female ex-convicts without homes and lost and wandering women and children, helping them find a way out. Therefore, the Catholic Benevolent Hall in Hongqiao Lane has also become a school and inn for the helpless.</p>
