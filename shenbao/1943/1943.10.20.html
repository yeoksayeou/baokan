<p>社評</p>
<h3>積極推進流浪兒童敎養工作</h3>
<p>本市各街道，流浪兒童，觸目皆是。此輩既失敎養，强者流爲小竊，弱者淪爲乞兒。且遍體骯髒，　躅街頭，頗礙市容觀瞻·本市慈幼福幼等慈善團體，爲數頗多，而僅於貧苦兒童之收養，未及於流浪兒童的收容敎養，但格於人力物力，或絀於經責，未能大規模肅淸。即各團體之間，彼此缺乏聯繫，對於整個收容敎養的效率，未能充分發揮。</p>
<p>自從八月一日租界接收以還，瞬逾兩月，上海市之內容與外觀，異於往日而足以稱道者，實尙未多觀。僅以街頭流浪兒童一事而言，收容敎養，寓有培養民族的積極意義，姑置不談；即於有礙市容一點，市政常局亦應設法收容，不能任其自然。况天時漸寒，此輩流浪兒露宿街頭，無衣無食，凍餒交煎，即木於惻隱之心，亦應設法收容。因此，深切盼望市政當局爲整頓市容，從速籌策收容街頭流浪兒童，視爲接收租界以後第一件德政，亦不爲過。</p>
<p>上海市民福利協會，係民圖團體，以謀市民福利爲宗旨，報載該會於十六日冬季會員大會時，建議　會同慈善團體籌款，收容街頭流浪兒童」，常即成立「流浪兒童敎養委員會」專責進行。我們即於十七日社評中竭力聲援，盼望該會積極推進，並貢獻意見三點。頃悉流浪兒童敎養委員會已於昨日舉行首次籌備會議，商決進行辦法數點。（均見本日報載）我們對於該會注意此事而迅速舉辦，表示十分欽佩，即就商決各點，略申管見如次：</p>
<p>（一）流浪兒童，是巳經失去父母之愛，失去父母保護的無辜者，而其天眞智慧，與一般兒童絕無區別。同樣的可以培養成人，爲未來社會的構成分子。所以，此輩流浪見童的敎養責任，應由社會擔負。目前原有的慈幼福幼團體，綜合的力量，尙不足以負此重任，則另籌更具力量的團體，肩此全部責任，自極需要，但原有團體辦理巳有經騐，並爲彼此工作避免重複浪費，應聯絡進行。至於收留以後之敎養地點，我們主張以鄕村區域爲宜。第一，膳宿及一般物價低廉。第二，風俗淳厚，環境優美。第三，空氣新鮮，與兒童健康有益。目前雖因材料困難，未能大規模建築房屋，但可利用鄕村廟宇等空屋，亦較上海覔屋爲易。上海僅爲收留時暫時過渡，待鄕村區域佈置妥當，即行移入。</p>
<p>（二）上海究竟有多少流浪兒童，不易得正確數字，惟收容兒童的年齡，應與成人有適當區別與限制，成人乞丐大部分有其自暴自棄的原因，不能與無辜的兒童比擬。該會假定收容五千人，分爲若干批，第一批一千人，當然五千人的數目是假定，事實上或不止此數，但能辦理確有成績，則經費籌集自易，可以分批繼續辦理，直至肅淸爲止。</p>
<p>（三）在開始辦理時，最成問題者，　爲經費之籌集，該會假定半年經費八百萬元，向社會各界籌募三百萬元，希望政府協助五百萬元。對此數日，不能不說相當龐大，但就前者而言，以目前社會的經濟能力，三百萬元常非難事，惟共焦點，在乎社會人士對此舉的認識如何？熱心如何？就後者而言，當然無大問題，惟其焦點，亦在於當局對此舉的認識如何？決心如何？如果社會有認識有熱心，當局有認識有決心，則不但目前的經費易集，而其結果必能達到圓滿的成績。我們盼望社會人士本於愛護自己子女之心情，顧念此輩流浪兒童之天眞無辜，指望將來成爲國家社會的中堅，各盡力量，慷慨輸將，俾達收容與敎養目的</p>
<p>（四）主持社會福利之政府機關，中央有社會福利部，上海市有社會福利局，對此收容與敎養流浪兒黨，爲職務範圍內之事，原應居於領導地位，早籌辦理，今上海市民福利協會既以民間團體自動肩此重任，積極策進，則政府機關之充分協助，增强推進力量，自屬義不容辭，不待請求而始可。我們盼望有關常局重視敎養流浪兒童的積極意義與自身的責任，對於該會將來經費給予充分協助，對於該會將來工作予以嚴格指導。</p>
<p>最後，我們認爲學齡兒童不但失畢，而且失養，是現代文明國家所罕有的現象。我們上海市又是全國最大都市之一，也是具有國際性的都市之一，市容的整飭與否，關　於國際與國內人士的觀瞻至鉅，况當租界接收之後，全市行政，完全操之於國人掌握，市容之整飭，進步與退步，更關繫於國人整個體面，因此，純爲整頓市容設想，市政當局，尤應積極重視，力促其成。况且，敎養兒童，尙有培植未來國家命脈的意義呢。</p>

<h3>日澈底改革官制閣議中正式決定將中央權利委讓於地方廳</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電日政麻為强化國內體制，實現決戰期之行政起見，巳將中央行政機構大行改革，同時將中央官廳之權利及事務澈底委讓於地方廳藉期行政之迅速，且經內閣積極擬定具體方策，茲已獲有成案，於十八日舉行地方行政協　會議中徽詢意見後。即於十九日循例閣議中將地方行政機構少整頓强化措置各項提出討論，經交換意見　。即正式決定，此項內容，巳由情報局於是日下午五時發表，中央官廳之權力及行政事務，將大部份委讓於地方行政協議會長，地方長官及協議會地方廳。地方行政之顯著擴充與中央行政之簡素，强化決戰行政之迅速，實可期待。又農商省官制案，巳由　制局　定成案，於十九日閣議中提付審議，又內閣及外務，內務人藏各省之提案　內務省設立之防空　水部官制，亦於昨日閣議中提付審議，日政府即將一併諮詢樞密院，又閣於軍　省，運　通信省改革官制　機構，亦巳諮詢樞密院，故日政府之改革官制，巳經全部決定。</p>
<h3>菲律賓着手擴充新政府內部機構同時增強對日經濟協力</h3>
<p>馬尼刺十九日巾中社電菲律賓政府為整飭建國後之內外行政機棣，乃自十八日起召開特別國會，首先創設企劃院，俾强力實行國內各項企劃。並著手擴充强化政府機構，現擬進行者除　立外交部外、並將設置二三咸單獨部、以資促進戰時行政。推行圓滑，同時並將斷行加强各部之陣容，新政府之內部機構，大約如次：菲律賓獨立　之行政機構，概分六部，惟獨立改稱共和國後、預料其至低將擴充至九部或十部。首就內政部而言。內政部是否將設立國防部不得而知，惟因現在菲律賓國軍尙未編成，故預料國防部於短期內或未必設置，關於防衛國土維持國內治安等項事宜，在國防部未設立前，將暫置於內政部管轄下，因此內政部機權內，定將强化警務方面之陣容。再關於一般行政方面，亦必將大加充實陣容，俾强化政府之行政力，內政部乃政府機構內規模最大之組織，故預料類有添設二名次長，分管一般行政與警務方而事務，以輔佐內政部長之必要。又　亦曾擬設國防部。在國軍未編成前，　內政部長兼攝部長。並置內政國防次長各一人，內政掌理一般一行政，國防專司警務，俾　國防軍易於編成。次預料將改組者為去這農商部與敎育厚生部，農商部使分為農林，商工二都，敎育厚生部使分為敎育與勞動厚生兩部，因農林部及開發天然資源，而商工部亦有妥　確立自給經濟之重要任務，故有各　為部之必要。又國敎育部亦因雖者培植東亞精神，以為獨立國家所是有這基礎，而應單設為部，此外關於其他各部，預料恐與獨立前之　政機權無太差別。</p>
<p>企劃院　組織及工作</p>
<p>馬尼刺十九日中央社電菲總統洛勒爾於一十八日召閉之議會中，首一先聲明設置企劃院為擴充非行政機構之一項，並決根　當日行政令第一號進行組織，據該行政令規定，菲律資企　院之性格，完全為一以經濟行政為中心，而進行設計之母體，其機能　如下列規定：　開發及利用經濟資源，再建經濟自給體制，並樹立確保新政府財源各對策。　輔佐大總統調整重　國策或修　事宜、檢討各部態行立審之各項計劃或諸般事業，並予調整或修正。按此機關設立之初，暫稱為經濟審議會，其主要目的乃　重於第一項，利用及開發經濟資源之綜合計劃及立案，企劃院總裁於必要時方召　部長局長以及　他政府機關之代表者，提供　或提出情報之權限，大總統頃切通令各行　機　該予援助，企劃院總裁一職，刻暫由農　部部長亞兩　兼任，副總裁則由洛哈斯充任，該氏，曾任財政部長，事松政府時代曾任國民經濟委會總裁，而為計劃組成現在菲律賓國家主義經濟機　者，委員方面有財長阿朗斯，土大交通專家竇斯以及菲律賓經濟界各權威者，類有經濟參謀部之伸景。在企劃院機能發揮之　，菲律習之國家經濟機構，定將顯著改善，預料不僅自給之經濟體制得以　備，同時對日之經濟協力，亦將顯著增强。來栖大使</p>
<h3>來大使　作公開演講</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電日本特命　機大使來極三耶，於十九日下午在東京帝國大學舉行公開演　。　題為十抨終英美之戰爭目的」。指摘英美之戰爭目的，決非引起此　戰爭之矛盾混　狀態，　欲再强制世界恢復戰前之秩序，以遂其制覇世界之野心，並揭破英美之陰謀，「英美為掩飾此種野心，故諱　戰爭目的，徒事　論空虛之戰後問題」。又就　之戰後經營論加以分別檢討，說明大東亞共榮　之大理想，純為立脚於大東亞諸民族歷史之　互倚　的結合，而為順應環境要求之合理的秩序。最後更鄭重聲稱，「我人所負之使命，在違成解敎東亞之目的與東亞　民族同心戮力建設東亞共榮　，更進而使我人之幸福，非由東亞民族獨占，擴之於全世界，期共同建設眞正之世界和平」。泰國慶祝接收新領土相邸舉行盛宴</p>

<h3>中國方面　日空軍戰果　美駐渝空軍受重大損失</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日大本營十九日下午三時卅份發表帝國陸軍航空部隊轟炸駐渝敵航空勢力，尤其攻擊美空軍某地，幷炸毀敵軍事設　及船舶奪，或　　來襲之敵機，　仍到處擊碎其　動企圖。自七月下旬至十月上旬之綜合戰果如次：　（敵方損害）墜毀敵機一二四架，內有廿四架不確。炸毀敵　　及軍事設施十七處，共計轟炸五十三次。炸沉敵船七艘，炸毀十一艘。　（我方損害）飛機自炸四十架。陸軍機隊戰果一斑　東京十九日中央社電據此間軍事專　　：日陸軍際隊在中國前終活　情形稱，美駐渝空軍與渝方空軍，　第一綫擁有飛機三百數十架。最近為呼　敵方西南太平洋在戰，及奪囘緬旬作戰，乃不斷轟炸日軍佔領地，擾亂後方，並想空戰日本本上，同時整備內地某地禺及建　遂川吉安等前綫基地。但日陸軍機隊早巳先發制人，自七月下旬起至十月上旬止，層屢猛炸敵軍基地，炸毀　塲設施及地上停放之飛機。並地敵機展開激烈之空戰，　落其戰鬥機多架，復又擊退前來空襲之敵　。予　重創。在此　問，日機共　毀敵機一二四架，（內有二四架尙未證實。）炸毀敵方機塲軍事設施十七處，前後轟炸數達五十三次。炸沉　　毀敵船艇十八的。巳完全粉碎敵機之企圖，而完成防衛日本本土之省任，茲誌其戰果內容如次：（擊落敵機）　機B/24犁十二架，B2/5型一架（未證實）戰鬥機（P38）型二集，（內有一架尙未證實，）（P40。）型九十四架，（內有十九架尙未體實），（P43）型五架，（內有一架尙朱　實），及機型不明者一架，共一一五架，擊毀轟炸機（B24）型八架，（P41）型一架，共計九架。炸毀主要機塲及軍事設施，轟炸建甌十二次，　陽九次，桂林四次。零陵三次，寶雞芷江梧州南一雄遂川各二次·重慶·雲南·贛州·南寗·及吉安各一次。（炸毀埠頭一設施）轟炸巴東西次。萬縣及三斗坪各三次。（炸沉船艇一炸沉一千噸級者三艘，五百　級者叫艘，炸毀一千噸級乾三妙。五百噸級者二艘。油槽船二艘，及其他小艇多　。</p>
<p>東京十九日中央社電據日軍某基地電美駐渝空軍之覬覦日本本十已非一日故除於昆明　根本地點、於　林重慶設中間某地外，並在其他各地設有前進基地，以圖乘機空襲日本本土，及極　日軍兩方斯援路。但入七月以來，因日陸　機之連續出學其基地，故其企圖巳被粉碎。同時因其拍失大量飛機及航空員，其實力亦因此而消滅。因之近傳斯蒂維爾等首腦部飛往新德里事。或係與東南亞反軸心軍司令部協議，改編美駐渝空軍及補充人員器材之　。</p>
<p>美國空軍單獨作戰</p>
<p>又渝方目睹美駐渝空軍此種慘敗　　，對之更形失望，對於抗戰　途、乃益形悲觀。按渝方對美國之希望，六為供給嘛機與器材碼重建渝空軍。但美國則未應渝方此種要求，軍派本國空軍駐於浦方，藉以掌握渝方空權。自是渝軍只負資建　基地、擔任地上勤務等工作至於作載等則由美軍獨執，亦不與渝方軍委會　絡，如此渝方稱為獨力抗戰之面目全失。蓋美空軍進駐時。渝方頗表歡迎。並供給美空車一切　戰之便宜。如建設基地通訊　測氣象等，地上勤務無不　渝軍擔當，各地軍民　全體出動、設　款待。以　好感。但結里美空軍　決不與渝軍聯絡，致使渝方大失所望。查其　因，並非美空軍之秘密作戰生義。而係不以渝軍為眞正友軍之　善王義。蓋迄今美空軍從不與渝軍共同作戰，對於渝軍更無援助。如七月未日，日機進攻　麼時，美空軍即棄渝空軍於不顧，自行遁去諸如此等獨善行為。於其日常生活中，尤為　然，故巳形成各地渝方軍民憤慨之目的。</p>
<p>人力補充大感不足</p>
<p>蓋當此　方各地極感食糧不是之時，美空軍雖以多數運輸機由印度運來食物烟酒等，但均供自享。又當桂林一帶虎疫流行時，駐柱林之美空軍亦僅顧自己之安全。對於渝方軍民則始終未嘗一顧。又因駐渝美空軍之驕矜構暴。其軍紀故益紊亂，如桂林昆明　地之娼妓，殆巳為美空軍兵士　獨店。彼等之橫　實非筆墨所能形容。近因彼等屢吃敗仗，人力大盛不足，乃使曾在美受訓之中國航空員加入隊內。然此等措置。更顯露共獨善主義之馬脚矣。蓋中國航空員之勤務時問，遠較美人為長，而薪給則僅有美人五分之一。食宿一切殆無不遜於美人，故中國人對彼　之反感，已日益加　。</p>
<p>中薗中將壯烈陣亡</p>

<p>違警罰余增為力倍</p>
<p>南京十九日中央社電查違警罰法之運用，原與刑法息息相關，其所定之罰法，與刑法規定之刑具同一之作用。現在關於刑法罰金巳　為五倍，而違警罰金則仍為一角以上十五元以下。不僅與刑法失聯繫之旨。在現時生活程度之下，此輕微數額亦難收懲戒之效，此亟應改訂者一也。違警罰法規定罰金一元，易處拘留一日。而刑法易服勞役，以一元以上三元以下折算一日，兩相比較，顯不平衡，此亟應改訂者二也。各警察機關拘留人犯之口糧、在違　罰金收入項下動用，近來糧價日漲，所以不數開支，此亟應改訂三者也。此次內政部警政會議，各省市提出議案，對於上項問題，　　援照戰時科處罰金辦法，將違警罰金增為五倍。以廳現時需要。內政部基上述理由，特探訂戰時判處違　罰金暫行辦法，提出行政院會議公決，今晨第一八三次會議句業巳通過。</p>
<p>合作委會組織規程</p>
<p>南京十九日中夾社電我國合作事業向稱落後。事變以還，友邦日本在我華中各地，曾設中國合作社，從事生活必需品之簾價配給，及生產用資材如耕牛肥料種籽苗　等之配給，農產物之合理　銷，及貸欽存款，　棉花稻麥養　　等增產之推廣，成立以來，成績　然。本年七月底，友邦已約該項合作社全部移交我國府接辦、今後在國府直接指導之下，合作事業定有更大之發展曦蓋際此國家加緊實施國防經濟之際，合作社實負有完成統制一經濟，公定人民生活之重大使命，故策進推動，均屬不容或緩，十九日行政院舉行第一八三次會議巾，決議設置合作事業委員會，商隸於行政院，負責今後合作事業之推進監查。及合作技術之指導，合作社職員之訓練　事宜，　以促進全國合作事業之發展，所有全體委員亦　派定，均為有開各部長官及各方專家。並指定由實業部長陳君　兼任委員長，由委員鐘任壽兼在秘習長。至該會組織規程亦　通過，茲　原文如下。</p>

<h3>米糧採銷總處　結束一切業務　糧食部負責人談話</h3>
<p>南京十八日中　社電米糧統制委員會一切工作。現雖在積極推進中，惟全而收買工作之展開因內部機構尙未全部確立，故尙有待少許時日。而糧食部米糧採銷總管理處之藥務，則至太月二十日即行截止。是以各方對此過渡期問，關於各方配給工作，是否或將因此有中斷之處，殊為　切。中央社記者為此特於日昨往訪糧食部負責人　詢，在一此過渡期問，部方對各方配給之處置方針。據云：來糧統制委員會原　約定自十月份起，各方配給即由議會負責，嗣以手續繁重，迄今尙未　備齊金，迭請本部繼續維持。兼以各方關心，堅　暫維現狀，本部為顧全大局計，　將配景準備決予配給，業經則攬者：　軍警米至十二月。　京滬市民食米可維持至十一月。　各會市淸鄉部隊至十月。　各官邸及公務員人員米至十一月。本部之所以如此　量配給者，藉使米統會可得從容之時問，作充分之準備。惟現以原有業務　關均經結束，深望米統會從　開始收買，接續　　配給　宜，俾民食軍糧不致間斷。</p>
<h3>美財長抵北非　將視察戰塲</h3>
<p>阿　斯特丹十九日中央社電華盛頓訊。美財長摩根韜偕其財政專家數人，現正作戰塲訪開之舉，摩氏已於十五日偕同其私人秘書史密斯　幣制專家　五愛脫抵阿爾及　。</p>
<p>里斯本十九日中央社電美人之反對財長摩根韜所　增稅　者繼　增震，產氏巳偕財部幣制專家韋特及摩氏之機要幫辦史密斯乘飛機赴戰綫視察。據悉一行三人巳於上星期三抵達阿爾及　，預　將遊歷數星期。同時華盛頓方面之全國製造商協會亦已參加反對摩氏之增稅計劃，該會謂摩氏之計劃不健全不切實，且可謂為幻想，如必須增稅，則宜增加零售稅云，但羅斯福總統夫人則謂，渠始終反對零售稅制度，蓋其影響者將為入息低微之輩云。</p>
<h3>德裝置噴火砲空戰獲重大勝利</h3>
<p>瑞與京城十九日中央社電　與空軍轟炸德國斯溫福特一役、喪失矗炸機百四十架左右。實予美國人民以莫大衝動。據華盛頓來電，美軍航空隊司令阿諾爾多中將十八日曾宣稱：「美空軍轟作德國斯溫福特之際，德軍先以單發動戰　機　戰，繼則出動有噴火砲裝置之雙發動戰　　，　藍是役德軍乃以新兵器收獲如此之戰也。</p>
<h3>聶伯河流域　攻防戰劇烈　克里曼卓德軍仍堅守陣地</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　柏林電·東綫蘇軍之進攻、巳　滯於　伯河流域，數週間戰局變動。但十五日以來，蘇軍又於克里曼卓方面開始猛攻，戰局遂又告緊張。其攻勢之猛烈，據德軍當局十六日稱述，實為蘇軍此次夏季攻勢以來未曾有者。攻舉巳歷三日之久，非特勢不稍　，且　益熾烈，職局之推移實堪注目。按蘇軍攻擊之　點，乃在契尼極夫四北斯摩倫斯充四方維里基魯基南方克里曼卓東南方等地，尤以克里曼卓方面之攻勢最為猛烈。刻蘇軍正自　伯　右岸之橋頭堡陸續出勤，多數坦克車及機械化部隊欲突破德軍陣地，但據德軍當局宣稱，其戰略的突破作戰實未成功。　之現勞，萬一蘇軍自克里曼卓方面繞　伯河灣曲部之後方南犯，則不只南方孟斯坦元帥　下德軍將紹於且當兩苦之境地，至於克里米亞半島之德軍陣地亦將感受威脅。但德軍當局對該方戰局演進，以為尙未到發表意見之期，故刻持極平錚態度。蓋　氣候而言，現巳至十月中旬，東綫各處巳陸臨落雨，然此並非正式之冬季來臨，蘇軍之攻勢自不能為此所阻也。</p>
<h3>義境戰事重心　移中部山區　德拖延戰略效</h3>
<p>羅馬十九日中央社電　據海通社訊：昨悉貝　格立里軍隊，繼續開拔赴南部戰綫。</p>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電　德國新聞社地中海區特派員稱：英美在義大利南部之軍事行動，現正集中於對付亞平靑山脈之德軍戰綫，星期日沿海兩翼之戰事活動漸减，顯然因敵在該區遭遇運輸上極大困難之故。德軍在過去數星期之戰術，已使英美軍實際上無法利用由北通南之公路，此等公路　乎完全被地雷或其他　炸物所破壞而不適於用，因此反軸心軍無法向前疾進。此　戰略之特性，可於星期日卡普亞東北。亞平宿山入口處一役中見之。該處英美軍尤其在加斯德兩迪　索附近，屢作突被之企圖，均被阻未逞，敵損失重大。德平射砲與高射砲隊擊毀英裝甲偵察東四輛與坦克車三輛，同時英加軍力圖打開由福查通往羅馬之公路亦為德軍所阻，敵難奪　亞平　高山中貝拉諾之一部份，但　德軍由貝拉諾附近據高臨下之山，頭陣地實行二次最勇敢之猛攻時，敵即大敗，英加軍若干隊被切斷而被俘，同時敵傷兵若干名亦在該地被擒。</p>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電　海通社軍事訪員塞托里斯稱：上週杪義南觀事之特徵、並無變化。德軍仍以拖延戰略，由少數軍隊抵抗進攻之敵軍，兵力雖少，但常能予敵眾以有力之打擊，卡普亞東北日而敵軍即在德軍此種戰略之下·遭受重創傷，德軍使用長射程大砲亦予有功焉。數日來密　之砲火，卒使伏爾托諾河北岸之敵軍未群佈就陣址。據十七日德軍戰報稱、德軍後衛巳自伏爾托諾與亞平寗山區撤退，　　文契亞托洛與甘波巴素、分向西北與北面撤退。英美軍在上述二區之進展，僅數公里而巳、而所受之損失極重。協約軍現仍遭遇吾軍迷離之戰略，無法窺知凱賽林將軍將在何感與工作主力戰。週杪敵軍仍在大事補充其兵力，美穿五軍巳將文契亞托洛兩翼之軍隊調走，致力於西進，但因沿途交通巳遭破壞，故其搬運重軍器極感困難，故英美軍之兩翼與中翼未衝過伏兩托諾河口，即卡耶柴塞勒托·文契亞托洛·甘波巴素一綫，東翼戰事仍無變化。</p>
<h3>德在巴爾幹掃蕩順利</h3>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電　擴德國新聞社訊：過去數日間。在多瑙河南部之巴爾幹區德軍之兩大掃蕩作戰巳順利進行，而獲得成功。此次之行動係以追蹤法拉斯加山區之游匪為目的，而個薩克志願兵　游匪施以猛烈之攻擊後，巳將之驅散，俘獲游匪八百名。於戰地上亦消滅同數之匪徒於其他戰利品甚多。據報告謂，匪徒等多有自相殘殺者，先力克斯黨徒與共產黨徒常生　突，此可見英人受莫斯科之壓迫對塞爾維亞之國家漸不感興趣。斯洛伐區之　絡山間其他之掃蕩行動　亦在繼續中德軍與當地之衛隊合作，殲滅工作，多於夜間進口，一所滿住匪徒之醫院及其他滿戰軍火之秘密軍火庫亦被佔領。某一　游匪曾乘夜色之掩獲　遺屍二百三十具·向山問逃去，且帶同受傷之匪徒同　·戰塲上陳屍三百及俘虜一千八百名，多受重僇者，其接潛匪黨之車輛，亦均被俘獲。</p>
<h3>英印政府　通過新法律</h3>
<p>阿姆斯特丹十九日中央社電　新德里報告稱：星期一英印政府曾通過新法律二種·背信者　　　防者　敵通情報者及阻礙軍隊行動者均規定一律處死　。</p>
<h3>德英交換俘虜</h3>
<p>柏　十九日中央社電　　月來德外交部　進行談判、與英交換俘虜中重傷之德兵衛生工作人員及有病之德商輪水手、故於最近之將來，德兵五千餘名將返德，而被俘之英傷兵及衛生工作人員亦將返英，其交換日期為十月十八十月十九及二十六，而其地點則在北非哥德波克及百色明拉等處。</p>
<h3>保加利亞領土　首次遭空襲</h3>
<p>菲亞十九日　社電　今日此間官方所發表之報告稱：保加利亞　領土自一九四一年四月以來，於昨日首次遭敵　之襲擊。據保國總參謀部宣稱：敵機多架於十月十八日飛越保境，並擲下炸彈多枚　復以機槍掃射，在斯柯波　近郊有平民多人傷亡。</p>
<h3>艾登赫爾抵蘇　會議昨開始　傳英美訂新協定</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十九日中央社電　據莫斯科報告稱：在莫斯科舉行之三國外長會議，即將於星期二下午開始舉行，英外相艾登美國務卿赫爾　蘇外交委員長莫洛托夫巳於星期一晚晤談。</p>
<p>日內瓦十九日中央社電據倫敦消息：星期二日即莫斯科會議之前夕，將在倫教簽訂一協定，規定增加　蘇聯之供應。同時英美蘇租借協定展期一年之草案亦將簽字。</p>
<h3>波根維爾島　空戰愈烈　襲新幾內亞美機受挫</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社一電南太平洋某基地十九一日電，日，美兩軍在所羅門海城之空巾決戰，愈演愈烈。美空軍十八日上午以戰鬥轟炸機主力八架，連合大編隊來襲彼根排爾島東端，日軍地上部隊即以砲火迎擊，擊落敵轟炸機四架、另有三架冒出　烟、餘機即被完全擊退，巳方之損害極輕，又敵機P34　二十架，復於是日下午來襲該地。日海軍航空隊，即昇空迎擊，雙方展開織烈空戰，擊落敵機八架，是役日　未返者五架。</p>
<p>東京十九日中央社電南太平洋日軍某基地十九日電，十七日曾有敵機綢隊來襲新幾內亞日陣地，當由日軍機隊及地上部隊邀學，由空戰擊落敵Bz5型機三架。P38型　一架，以高射砲擊毀敵　25型機數架，而將其擊退，日機未歸還者三架，陸上略受損傷。</p>

<p>田尻公使代表奧田參事官致詞云：今天代表大使館與諸位說幾句話，確保軍需民食之要點為米糧之積極收買。中日雙方政府付予商統會組織「米糧統制委員會」。從前收買米糧結果，成績欠佳，此次糧統會負責打破收買困難。有仰中日雙方努力合作，想必對於收買米糧工作，定有良好結果，本人並希望米糧統制機構，能領導其他統制機構，此為本人今天希望之要點。</p>
<p>木下中將　期待糧會</p>
<p>登部隊長木下中將致詞云：蘇浙皖三省之產　，不論供給軍需及民間所需其總量充足，已為一般所確認，華中之食糧問題，決非係產米量之不足。而係過去收買運輸辦理不善　致，此點巳由各界　指出。因之糧食問題解決之成否，全繫於收買運輸任務之完成。軍方各人之期待於糧統會者在此。過去米穀收買能率之被阻碍，乃係中間商人之超過和潤·與抑低價格，致使農民有不願出售之傾向，今次糧統會　接向農民瞞買至配給價格為止，均有公正之決定，農民商人　費者　，確定公平適當之分配，是今後之絕大決意。</p>
<p>太田少將　發表希望</p>

<p>上海地區主要商品搬出入申請許可一覽表</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>增產的先決條件</h3>
<p>昨　努力於事業之進步，生產之增加，期毋負投資者的期望，乃是工業界的責任。可是，欲謀生產之增加，必須解決工廠生產之原料；工嚴生產之原料，大都為農產品。近年百物昻貴，農民耕種成本，隨之增高。今年農產品的成本，據最近中國經濟硏究會的估計，較諸上年，有增高至三倍之多。農民生計，全恃農產品收入以資挹注，假令對於農產品之收買，過分壓低，必致農民感受損失，因而不願力於耕種。昔時「穀賤傷農」之說，可為明證。故欲增進生產，必先獎勵農產品的增加。</p>
<p>獎勵農產品最為有效的方法，莫如提高收買價格。棉花糧食之類，昔以定價過低，收買頗感困難，近頃當局有鑒於此，巳將收買棉花糧食的價格，逐漸增高，一方體恤農民，一方便利收買，此種養育政策，最為得當。</p>
<p>此外，尙有二事可以直接推動農產品的增進，其一為農貸，由各銀行組織銀團，為農貸之工作。舉凡改良種子，購買肥料，以及改善農村生活，均藉農貸來推進；其次為墾荒，由政府去策動，並且隨時隨地擴大其範圍，例如最近建部在太湖畔分區墾植耕田一舉，可以說是一個最好的施政方針。對於增產運動，是有直接補助的。</p>
<h3>本市各業公會　積極展開會務　改組整理工作均已就緒</h3>
<p>本市各主要及次要同業公會，自本年四月份起，經關係主管官署加以改組，旨在使公會適應戰時體制，公全整理工作開始迄今，巳違半年，各主要公會早巳改組就緒，即次要公會，亦十九改　　事，查本市各業公會約有三百家左右，現各公會正積極展開會務。</p>
<p>强化機構</p>
<p>各業公會所設立評價委員會，專事對於該業各項商品價格之評定工作，各公會為使該項機構强化起見，該委會之人選，除由公會理監事擔任外，並將延聘該業專家，考察各項商品之原料，及成本等項，而定一公平之限價，為輔助評價委員會所訂之限價起見，並成立調查組，派遣幹員至各商店門市部密查其有無不遵限價情事。</p>
<p>收買原料</p>
<p>各業所需之原料，向由各商號個別自行向產區採辦，但邇來物資移動之統制甚嚴，採購不但困難重重，且各項運費，亦頗鉅大，一部份公會有鑒於斯，故對於其會員所需之原料，將由公會申請當局協助，至產區大量收買運滬後，分別配予各會員。</p>
<h3>顏料係主要商品同業應入公會</h3>
<p>上海特別市商會，近據粗細顏料雜貨業同業公會呈稱，顏料自奉令在三省兩市內搬運無須許可證，而雜貨又不在統制之列，是以少數無須在本埠移動物資之同業，有視公會加入與否，無關得失，延不入會者，應如何糾正，　函請商統會核復，頃據記者探悉，顏料一項，包　在化學工業品內，巳經　業部規定列入主要商品，按照工商同業公會暫行條例第十三條二項之規定，經營主要商品之公司行號，非經加入同業公會，不得營業，同業公會對於未入會之同業行號，應依法指導，或根據同條第一項規定，報請主管官署令其加入同業公會，商統會已將此意函復市商會轉知辨理云。</p>
<h3>本市蛋類供求　將設新機構　予以嚴密統制</h3>
<p>本市蛋類價格，前曾一度猛漲、考其原因，實由於奸商之壟斷所致，查本市關係當局，對於蛋類之統制，曾設有專門機校，但一切未臻十　密分，故不肖之蛋商，仍有活動餘地，當局以蛋價之上漲，攸關民生至鉅，故寄予密切注意，並設法予以抑平，日前第一區公署，巳訂立各種蛋類之限價，零售商絕對不得超過限價，否則決予嚴懲，頃悉當局對於蛋類，不但規定其價格，且對於供求方面，亦將予以嚴密統制。</p>
<p>統制賣買</p>
<p>關於當局為使統制工作臻效起見，將成立一新統制機構，一切俱在關係人士考慮硏究中，此機構對於蛋業之進口及市上賣買，均將實施合理妥善之統制，以後凡蛋類之移動，無論為搬出或搬入，均須憑當局所核發蛋類運輸許可證。</p>
<p>分配比率</p>
<p>本市蛋類需要量甚大，每月輸入　目極為可觀，關於蛋類之輸入及分配事宜，由日華雙方共同担任，担任之機關，日方為日商蛋業聯合會，我方為全國各地區蛋業聯合會及上海區蛋業公會。關於蛋類之分配，日華雙方亦將遵照一合理之比率，鷄蛋大約日方佔百分之六十，我方佔百分之四十，鴨蛋則我方佔百分之六十，日方佔百分四十</p>

<p>譯論</p>
<h3>水稻品評與食糧增產</h3>
<p>在和平地區、食糧增產為一重要問題。雖然在　社會狀况之下，收買問題·亦　重要，不過其基本總在增加生產。農業生產優良　食糧問題，才可有根本的解決。</p>
<p>最近傳聞蘇州清鄕合作社及中國合作社指導委員會，為獎勵稻作增產起見，召集水稻增產品許會，此實為有意義之舉，其成果頗　期待。</p>
<p>當然，食糧增產問題，決不是僅僅品評會所能解決，其基本尙須有大規模計劃實踐的必要，品評會的主要意思，在增產政策上是屬於品種改良問題，有了優良品種，固然可以增加收穫效果，同時，肥料問題，亦極重要，不能忽視。</p>
<p>據一般人的硏究結果，華中水稻悄形頗多　日水類似之處，今後華中水稱增產政策，可參照過去日本的經騐作為一種基本改進的方針。</p>
<p>現在台灣的稻作，　常豐盛，他們採取兩項方策，一是秈米改種粳米，二是實施化學肥料，根據他們的經騐，秈米施肥，效果甚少，粳米則最為適宜，所幸　中淸鄕地區一帶，均為粳米區域，不必要更換品種，卽可實施肥料政策，當有圓滿成績。</p>
<p>此外南京方面尙有　大生產設備的化學工塲以及附近的硫化鐵礦·均為絕好條件，不用說，關係方面·當盡量予以協助開展，使化學肥料政策，得以實施，因而米穀能飛　的增產，不僅糧食問題可解決，廣大的農民層，亦可有所把握，對於農民政策。當然也可順行推進了。（　　十月十六日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>東綫德軍　採用消耗戰術</h3>
<p>目前德軍正在束部，戰綫實行決絕而當於暗示的歷史性的撤退作戰。共作戰正面，自斯摩倫斯克北方的德米特夫起，沿特聶伯河以迄亞素失海，綿延一千三百公里。關於三個月來憑特聶怕河天險而行的撤退作戰，是否行將告終，德軍當局既不作預言，蘇聯方而亦持愼重態度。要之，兩軍對於特聶伯河戰役之勝負，皆未能由現戰局得到肯定或否定的結論，殆為目前眞相。</p>
<p>事實上，紅軍之特大隊據守的橋頭堡，更聶伯渡河作戰，戰况之　於軍事要衝柴普絡傑（烈，可謂空前，蓋紅軍Zapozoje），特聶普堅欲於基輔附近作成突　洛彼德洛夫斯克（Dm破口。但德軍一面撤退ieproperuk）等地堅，一面擊退紅軍的攻勢　守　深數公軍的陣地，，在該河束岸各地遺留　沿河作成九曲十八灣的曲折戰綫·　佔　　米亞半　戰略　準的紅軍，以鑲軍的橋頭堡為員標，自九月二十八日以來，不斷展開激戰。據傳舉在乍普洛傑方面，紅軍已先後增援七個步兵萬關之衆。</p>
<p>蘇聯糧食不足</p>
<p>繼　直次德蘇戰爭，我們首先可以發現得，便是所謂蘇聯慣作冬季攻勢德軍特　夏季作戰的公式　完全打破了，因爲蘇聯已在夏天開始全面的攻勢。這第一由於蘇　加欲解決食糧問題，　囘烏克蘭實屬必要，第二則因恐　隨戰爭的拖延時日，紅軍的武器生產將不及德軍生產之速，所以一待英美登陸四四里的良機降臨，即　發動悽方壯烈的決戰。不論怎樣，蘇聯那種不惜人命物質而傾其全力作戰，的確使　友雙方不得不同聲驚歎。</p>
<p>現在·從翼斯科方面已可聽到，一今日還是馬鈴薯湯？「的呼聲，據說由於麵包的不足，蘇聯勞働者已漸有疲勞衰弱的現象。經過歷次召集，工塲幾乎成為娘子軍的世界。不僅此也，連前綫也有受過一年訓練的女子航空聯隊出現了。</p>
<p>在　　大本營的發表上，今日雖仍暗示　　人德　源及物的　源之　富，以促言論界再檢討其非歐洲性戰爭的性格；可是，紅軍作戰指導作一百八十度迥轉的微次夏季攻勢，倘著是由巳頻涸竭　的蘇聯戰爭潛在力展開的，那末「束部戰綫已臨重要　頭」的判斷，未必沒有可能</p>
<p>德軍節省實力</p>
<p>莫斯科發表，因泥濘期巳屆，由戈蕯克兵及四伯利亞　騎兵之精銳合種戰車部隊編成的特殊中間軍團巳和夏季攻略車交代。紅軍目前的優勢，固是無可否認的事實，出對德軍因受其壓力而退却的　解，則連英美方面也不相信。所以我們壓首肯德方有計書撤退之　。况且如果慮及次期的作戰，　防止人與物的投失，實屬必要。</p>
<p>這就是說，一方面考慮到　防止爲爭奪尺　寸土而流血的輕率作戰，另一方面　最對付蘇聯遊擊戰的手段，蓋史本材對於爲蘇重戰略特別致力，化甚至如對蘇聯的遊擊隊今日已完權脫却從來別動隊的規模　成為機動奇襲部隊了。例如在德軍背後構成點合綫，擁有飛機，大砲，戰車一應俱全的一軍，出沒自在，展開大規模後方攪亂戰是。</p>
<p>則，與上述相關，縮　戰綫，加以整理，一面加厚防禦綫，一面和戰略後備軍取得密切聯絡，以固戰略上有利的地位。也很必要。本　戰咯思想以　戰局，我們不得不承認德軍決戰上的聰明。戰爭在年內如果不能終結，則在完畢次期作戰的各種準備上，以得一時」爲必要，實屬當然。何況對於有計畫的撤退作戰，蘇聯每如過去的進擊作戰一般、輒遭德國機　部隊的大包圍殲滅戰，據紅軍俘虜說，德軍像羽毛般遣下的殿後部隊，反而對紅軍巧妙展開多次的包圍戰，因此而給予蘇聯的損失，據說紅軍傷亡合計二百萬，喪失戰軍二萬輛，飛機約萬架，這與德軍夏季攻勢中紅軍所受的損失比較，當然不算多，但由現在的戰力看，其對蘇聯的比重決不劣於過去二年，再看德軍的損失。以戰車一項言，祗合蘇聯的一成，由此可以測知德軍在這次作戰中。共目的是在何處了。（吉：譯自十月九日每日新聞）</p>
<p>國民論壇</p>
<h3>對於教師補助金的意見　其一</h3>
<p>這次市政當局為體恤敎師生活淸苦　見。決定以每月五十萬的鉅數，補助私立中小學的教職員。此舉當然為德政之一。而當筆者爲本文時在早報上已看到補助金將自月之二十日起開始發放了。　照我個人的見解，對於這次補助金的分發，站在敎師的立塲上。還有一些意見、買獻給當局。</p>
<p>如何取締兼傾者這次補助金的分發，不間中小學敎師、以一人為一份、兼踝的不得兼領兩人以上應得的補助金。辦法原很公允，不過敎師之中，兼課者很多，內中說不定有人用巧妙的方法，如一人向兩個名字　兼兩個學校的課程者，或許連學校方面也不知底細。而當局的查明，自亦非易。關於這點，我希望就在我們敎師的一羣中，作嚴密的調查和監視，一經發覺，那怕友好，也要不客氣的舉發　因為這次的五十萬補助金，以人數多少為攤派標準，有人多領了一份，便使其他的人每個都少拿了些，換句話說，他是兼領在衆人頭上，不容我們不舉發的。同時，更望當局明令公佈，對於不忠實而兼領兩人以上補助金的教師，一經查明，予以永久停發其補助金的處分</p>
<p>校長不應在補助之內　所謂補助金，是指補助私校的教職員，所以在名稱上，校長就是不擔任教職，也是職員之一，可得到補助。但上海多數私校校長，過去幾年，已發了大財、是用不到補助的了。所以我以為凡是做校長者，不應再補助。因為以往兩次救濟費，據筆者所知，有若干發財的校長，也不客氣的分了一部去，而且分得比敎師多。</p>
<p>不送名單責任誰負</p>
<p>這次分發補金的辦法是先由各校將教職長的名單繕送當局，並限十五日為截止期，過期不送，作為放棄論。然後再由當局締計所呈報的名單，作分配標準，微聞除多數學校，遵令如期呈送外，有少數學校。漠視教職員利益，名單並未送出，使敎職員應得的補助金，分攤在別人頭上。這貴任應由誰負？我以為非請校長如數補償於敎職員不可，照每月發放之期發給，否則這　失是太無謂了。</p>
<p>中途難職理應退還私立學校的一般敎職員，中途離職的很多，九其是近幾年來特別多。遇到呈報時在校、隔不一兩月離職的漱職員，有人承替的，他所應得的補助金、當然應由後來的領取　而有時他的職務教課　不請新人，由校中同人兼去乾，應得的補助金，我以為須退同。由當局暫為保管、支配在下學期的補助金內，否則必由校長拿去、於理不公　於情不該呢！</p>
<p>總之，這次五十萬補助金，以全市敎員數字之多。分配結果，每人所得有限，杯水車薪，雖談不上救濟，但分配方法，應以至公，所以上述幾點，也是應當注意的。　（求新）</p>
<p>其二</p>
<p>上海市敎育行政當局為救濟全市敎員之生活並見，內定每月撥五十萬元以為補助，當局撥給教員救濟金，重視敎育，培植國本，意義深長，毋庸贅述。然世問往往有一善作者不必善成、善始者不以善終」之事。結果與動機背道而馳者有之，結果受不良影饗乾有之。如事　。之航空建設獎券，提倡航空，鞏固國防，用意等美。然影響所及，助長人民僥倖心理，雖國防設固，亦得不償失矣。</p>
<p>本市敎員救濟金以前　有先例。當時敎靑界的確略受惠澤，異常感奮。但優劣不一，多寡懸殊，及其他種種弊端，致使口出怨言者亦有之。故筆者願乘救濟金尙未撥發以前，提出若千問題以供當局參考：</p>
<p>救濟金之分配應以敎員確數為標準，不應以學校範圍為依據。</p>
<p>已大中小學應普遍分配，務求均勻，不宜異同。藍小學救員工作比其他各級敎員繁重，而待遇則適得其反。故大中小學之等級應打破。</p>
<p>各校敎職負則平均分配，不宜因職務不同而有所多寡。上次救濟金會石基校敎導主任得八百元。敎員僅得二百元左右者，實非笑話。</p>
<p>校役是否在救濟範國之內？照理校役為學校之下層工作者，其有功於敎育初無二致，生活之淸苦或有甚於教員，亦應在救濟範圍之內。惟現今學校家庭化者甚多，往往僕役四五人，而眞正服務於學校者，僅一二人而巳。故校役救濟時應就眞正服務於學校者施予之，切不可濫發。過去曾有某校校長之母親煮飯（恐娘姨揩油糟塌）及娘姨，車夫，皆分得敘濟金，其有背於國家救濟教職員之初旨，殊進痛斥。</p>
<p>校長及若干浮職不得均沾。因校長生活較裕，浮職無功受祿，皆有疚於內心，即當局無此規定，亦應自動放棄。（如校長夫人自任會計，即可視為浮職）。</p>
<p>以上係就救濟金分配之本身而言。茲再有若干因教濟金而發生之附帶問題，因更有關於教有前途，故願略爲申述：</p>
<p>救濟金係改善教員生活之消極辦法，所謂權宜之計，不得巳之謀也。况員額衆多，所分得杯水軍薪。其有補於高度之生活，能有幾希？故筆者不辭大聲疾呼：嚴格的建立學校經濟公開制度，如各校當局不自動實行，應由行政當局强迫行之。至於如何使經濟公開，因非本文範圍，故不贅述。</p>
<p>救濟金撥發之目的，當然希望敎育界能安於敎學，提高效率，然其結果是否均能如吾人所預期，殊難保證。故筆者以為應於教濟金中抽出一部分－最好另行籌款，作為敎育獎勵金。依照戰前江蘇教育廳辦法，電調課卷，以考敎員教學之勤惰。舉行各項競賽及會考，以別各校成績之優劣。隨時派督學視察學校，以明各校實施之狀况。其勤者，優者及實　完善者，給予獎金及其他名譽獎勵；反之則予以適當之懲誡。此所謂鼓之舞之，較之單繩之救濟金，當能　更宏速之效率。（張啓揚）</p>

<h3>Actively Promote the Education and Care of Homeless Children</h3>
<p>In this city, homeless children are a sight that meets the eye everywhere. Because these children are deprived of education and care, the strong among them become petty thieves, and the weak become beggars. Moreover, they are covered in filth, wandering the streets, which greatly affects the appearance of the city. There are many charitable organizations in this city, such as those for nurturing infants and caring for the young, but they only focus on the adoption of poor children and have not extended to the accommodation and education of homeless children. However, due to limited manpower and resources, or insufficient funds, they have been unable to carry out large-scale clean-up operations. In addition, the lack of communication between the various organizations has prevented them from fully maximizing the efficiency of the overall accommodation and education efforts.</p>
<p>Since the handover of the concessions on August 1st, more than two months have passed. There are not many things about the inside and outside of Shanghai that have changed from the past and are worthy of praise. Taking the matter of homeless children on the streets as an example, the accommodation and education of these children has the positive significance of cultivating the nation, not to mention the fact that the municipal authorities should also find ways to accommodate them, rather than letting them fend for themselves, simply because they obstruct the appearance of the city. Moreover, as the weather gradually turns cold, these homeless children are sleeping on the streets, without clothes or food, suffering from both cold and hunger. Even out of compassion, we should find ways to accommodate them. Therefore, it is our deep hope that the municipal authorities will, for the sake of tidying up the city's appearance, quickly plan to accommodate homeless children on the streets, and regard it as the first act of good governance after the takeover of the concessions, which is not an overstatement.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association is a non-governmental organization dedicated to promoting the welfare of citizens. According to reports, at its winter members' meeting on the 16th, the association suggested "joining hands with charitable organizations to raise funds to accommodate homeless children on the streets," and immediately established a "Homeless Children Education and Care Committee" to take charge of the work. We immediately voiced our strong support in the editorial on the 17th, hoping that the association would actively promote this work, and offered three suggestions. We have learned that the Homeless Children Education and Care Committee held its first preparatory meeting yesterday and decided on several implementation methods. (All can be found in today's newspaper.) We express our deep admiration for the association's attention to this matter and its rapid action. Regarding the various points discussed and decided, we would like to express our humble opinions as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Homeless children are innocent people who have lost the love and protection of their parents, but their innocence and intelligence are no different from those of ordinary children. They can be nurtured into adults and become members of the future society. Therefore, the responsibility for educating and caring for these homeless children should be borne by society. At present, the combined strength of the existing infant-nurturing and youth-caring organizations is not enough to shoulder this heavy responsibility. Therefore, it is extremely necessary to establish another organization with greater strength to shoulder this entire responsibility. However, the original organizations have experience in handling these matters, and in order to avoid duplication and waste of work, they should be contacted to work together. As for the location for education and care after accommodation, we suggest that rural areas are more suitable. Firstly, the cost of food, lodging, and general goods is low. Secondly, the customs are simple and honest, and the environment is beautiful. Thirdly, the air is fresh, which is beneficial to the children's health. Although it is difficult to build houses on a large scale due to the current material difficulties, vacant houses such as temples in rural areas can be used, which is easier than finding houses in Shanghai. Shanghai is only a temporary transition for accommodation. Once the rural areas are properly arranged, the children can be moved in.</p>
<p>(2) It is not easy to obtain accurate figures on how many homeless children there are in Shanghai. However, the age of the children to be accommodated should have appropriate distinctions and restrictions from adults. Most adult beggars have reasons for giving up on themselves and cannot be compared with innocent children. The association assumes that 5,000 people will be accommodated, divided into several batches. The first batch is 1,000 people. Of course, the number of 5,000 people is an assumption. In fact, there may be more than this number. However, if the handling is indeed successful, it will be easy to raise funds, and it can be handled in batches until the cleanup is completed.</p>
<p>(3) At the beginning of the operation, the most problematic issue is the raising of funds. The association assumes that the expenses for half a year will be 8 million yuan, raising 3 million yuan from all sectors of society, and hoping that the government will assist with 5 million yuan. Regarding this number, one cannot say that it is quite large, but in terms of the former, with the current economic capacity of the society, 3 million yuan is not difficult, but the focus lies in how society recognizes this initiative? How enthusiastic are they? In terms of the latter, of course, there is no major problem, but the focus also lies in how the authorities recognize this initiative? How determined are they? If society has awareness and enthusiasm, and the authorities have awareness and determination, then not only will it be easy to raise the current funds, but the results will definitely achieve satisfactory results. We hope that people from all walks of life will, based on the feelings of loving their own children, consider the innocence of these homeless children, look forward to them becoming the backbone of the country and society in the future, and do their best to contribute generously, so as to achieve the purpose of accommodation and education.</p>
<p>(4) Government agencies in charge of social welfare include the Ministry of Social Welfare at the central level and the Bureau of Social Welfare in Shanghai. It is within their scope of duty to accommodate and educate homeless children, and they should have taken the lead in planning and handling this matter long ago. Now that the Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association has taken on this heavy responsibility and actively promoted it as a non-governmental organization, it is the government agencies' undeniable duty to fully assist and enhance the momentum of this initiative, without waiting for a request to do so. We hope that the relevant authorities will attach importance to the positive significance of educating and caring for homeless children and their own responsibilities, provide full assistance to the association's future funding, and provide strict guidance to the association's future work.</p>
<p>Finally, we believe that school-age children not only missing education but also missing care is a rare phenomenon in modern civilized countries. Our Shanghai is one of the largest cities in the country and also an international city. Whether the city's appearance is tidy or not is of great concern to international and domestic people. Moreover, after the takeover of the concessions, the city's administration is entirely in the hands of the Chinese people. The improvement or deterioration of the city's appearance is even more related to the entire face of the Chinese people. Therefore, purely for the sake of tidying up the city's appearance, the municipal authorities should pay active attention to this matter and strive for its success. Moreover, educating and caring for children also has the significance of cultivating the future lifeline of the country.</p>

<h3>Cabinet Officially Decides to Delegate Central Authority to Local Governments in a Thorough Reform of the Official System</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) In order to strengthen the domestic system and realize the administration of the decisive battle period, the Japanese government has carried out a major reform of the central administrative organs, and at the same time thoroughly delegated the powers and affairs of the central government offices to the local governments, in order to speed up administration. The Cabinet has actively formulated concrete plans, and has now achieved a consensus. After soliciting opinions at the Local Administration Cooperation Conference held on the 18th, the Cabinet formally decided on the 19th to submit various measures for streamlining and strengthening the local administrative organs for discussion at the regular Cabinet meeting, after exchanging opinions. The content of this matter has been released by the Information Bureau at 5 p.m. The significant expansion of local administration and the simplification of central administration, strengthening the speed of decisive battle administration, can be expected. In addition, the draft official system of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce has been finalized by the Legislative Bureau and submitted to the Cabinet meeting on the 19th for review. In addition, the proposals of the Cabinet and the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Internal Affairs, and Finance, as well as the official system of the Air Defense and Water Department to be established by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, were also submitted to the Cabinet meeting yesterday for review. The Japanese government will consult the Privy Council on all of these matters. In addition, the Cabinet has also consulted the Privy Council on the reform of the official system and organs of the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Ministry of Communications. Therefore, the Japanese government's reform of the official system has been completely decided.</p>
<h3>The Philippines Begins to Expand the Internal Structure of the New Government While Strengthening Economic Cooperation with Japan</h3>
<p>Manila, 19th (Central News Agency) In order to reorganize the internal and external administrative organs after the founding of the country, the Philippine government convened a special congress on the 18th, first creating a Planning Institute to strongly implement various domestic plans. It is also starting to expand and strengthen government organs. In addition to establishing a Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it is also planning to set up two or three separate ministries to promote wartime administration and promote smooth operations. At the same time, it will also decisively strengthen the lineup of various ministries. The internal structure of the new government is roughly as follows: The administrative organs of the independent Philippines were generally divided into six ministries, but after independence was renamed the Republic, it is expected that it will expand to at least nine or ten ministries. First, in terms of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it is not known whether the Ministry of National Defense will be established. However, because the Philippine National Army has not yet been formed, it is expected that the Ministry of National Defense may not be established in the short term. Matters such as defending the country and maintaining domestic security will be temporarily placed under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs before the Ministry of National Defense is established. Therefore, within the powers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the police force will definitely be strengthened. Furthermore, in terms of general administration, the lineup must also be greatly strengthened to strengthen the government's administrative power. The Ministry of Internal Affairs is the largest organization within the government, so it is expected that two vice ministers will be added to manage general administration and police affairs, in order to assist the Minister of Internal Affairs. It was also once proposed to establish a Ministry of National Defense. Before the National Army is formed, the Minister of Internal Affairs will concurrently serve as the minister, and one vice minister of Internal Affairs and one vice minister of National Defense will be appointed, with the former in charge of general administration and the latter in charge of police affairs, so that the National Defense Army can be easily formed. Next, it is expected that the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce and the Ministry of Education and Welfare will be reorganized. The Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce will be divided into two departments: Agriculture and Forestry, and Commerce and Industry. The Ministry of Education and Welfare will be divided into two departments: Education and Labor Welfare. Because the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has the important task of developing natural resources, and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry also has the important task of properly establishing a self-sufficient economy, it is necessary to have each as a ministry. In addition, the Ministry of Education also needs to be established as a separate ministry in order to cultivate the spirit of East Asia and serve as the foundation of an independent country. In addition, with regard to other ministries, it is expected that there will not be much difference from the administrative powers before independence.</p>
<p>Organization and Work of the Planning Institute</p>
<p>Manila, 19th (Central News Agency) At the parliament convened by Philippine President Laurel on the 18th, he first declared that the establishment of the Planning Institute was one of the ways to expand non-administrative organs, and decided to organize it in accordance with Administrative Order No. 1 of the same day. According to the administrative order, the nature of the Philippine Planning Institute is entirely an economic administrative center and a mother body for design, and its functions are as follows: Develop and utilize economic resources, rebuild the economic self-sufficiency system, and establish countermeasures to ensure the financial resources of the new government. Assist the President in adjusting important national policies or amending matters, reviewing various plans or various undertakings of the executive and legislative branches, and adjusting or correcting them. At the beginning of the establishment of this institution, it was temporarily called the Economic Review Council, and its main purpose was to focus on the first item, the comprehensive planning and establishment of the utilization and development of economic resources. The President of the Planning Institute may, when necessary, convene ministers, directors, and representatives of other government agencies to provide or submit information, and the President has issued a close order to various executive agencies to provide assistance. The position of President of the Planning Institute is currently temporarily held concurrently by the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, while the Vice President is filled by Roxas. He once served as Minister of Finance and was the President of the National Economic Committee during the Matsu government, and was the planner of the current Philippine nationalist economic mechanism. On the committee side are Minister of Finance Aranas, civil engineering transportation expert Dou Si, and various authorities in the Philippine economic community, with the appearance of an economic staff headquarters. With the functioning of the Planning Institute, the Philippine national economic mechanism will definitely be significantly improved, and it is expected that not only the self-sufficient economic system will be prepared, but also economic cooperation with Japan will be significantly enhanced. Ambassador Kurusu</p>
<h3>Ambassador Kurusu Delivers a Public Speech</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) Japanese Ambassador Kurusu Saburo gave a public speech at Tokyo Imperial University on the afternoon of the 19th. The topic was "Criticizing the War Aims of Britain and the United States." He pointed out that the war aims of Britain and the United States were by no means to resolve the contradictions and chaotic state that caused this war, but to forcibly restore the pre-war order to the world in order to fulfill their ambition to dominate the world. He also exposed the conspiracy of Britain and the United States, "In order to cover up this ambition, Britain and the United States evaded the war aims and only engaged in empty talk about post-war issues." He then separately reviewed the post-war management theories of various countries, explaining that the great ideal of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is purely based on the historical interdependence of the various nations of Greater East Asia, and is a rational order that meets the requirements of the environment. Finally, he solemnly stated, "The mission we bear is to achieve the goal of liberating East Asia and the East Asian nations working together to build the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and to further extend our happiness beyond the exclusive possession of the East Asian nations to the whole world, with the aim of jointly building a truly world peace."

In addition, the administrative decision of Tapan is subordinate to the Supreme Commander of the Thai Army, and is temporarily implemented by the Tapan Administrative Office. As for judicial administration, it is under the jurisdiction of the Kien court.</p>

(Our Damage) 40 planes self-destructed. A Glimpse of the Army Air Force's War Results Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) According to military experts here: The situation of the Japanese Army Air Force operating on the Chinese front is that the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing and the Chongqing Air Force have 300+ aircraft on the front line. Recently, in order to echo the enemy's war in the southwest Pacific and the operation to retake Burma, they have been constantly bombing Japanese-occupied areas, disrupting the rear, and wanting to conduct air raids on Japan itself. At the same time, they have been preparing a certain base in the interior and building frontline bases such as Suichuan and Ji'an. However, the Japanese Army Air Force had already taken the initiative and repeatedly bombed the enemy's bases from late July to early October, destroying airport facilities and aircraft parked on the ground. They also engaged in fierce air combat with enemy aircraft, shooting down many of their fighters and repelling enemy aircraft that came to conduct air raids, inflicting heavy damage. During this period, Japanese aircraft destroyed a total of 124 enemy aircraft (24 of which have not been confirmed), destroyed 17 enemy airport military facilities, and bombed 53 times in total. Sunk and destroyed 18 enemy ships, completely crushing the enemy's attempt and completing the provincial task of defending the Japanese mainland. The content of its war results is recorded as follows: (Enemy Aircraft Shot Down) 12 B/24 bombers, 1 B2/5 (unconfirmed) fighter (P38) type 2 aircraft (1 of which is unconfirmed), (P40) type 94 aircraft (19 of which are unconfirmed), (P43) type 5 aircraft (1 of which is unconfirmed), and 1 aircraft of unknown type, a total of 115 aircraft. Destroyed Bombers (B24) type 8 aircraft, (P41) type 1 aircraft, a total of 9 aircraft. Destroyed Main Airports and Military Facilities, bombed Jian'ou 12 times, Hengyang 9 times, Guilin 4 times. Lingling 3 times, Baoji, Zhijiang, Wuzhou, Nanyixiong, Suichuan each 2 times, Chongqing, Yunnan, Ganzhou, Nanning, and Ji'an each 1 time. (Destroyed Wharf Facilities) Bombed Badong 2 times. Wanxian and Sandouping each 3 times. (Sunk and Destroyed Ships) Sunk 3 ships of 1,000 tons, 4 ships of 500 tons, destroyed 3 ships of 1,000 tons, 2 ships of 500 tons. 2 tanker ships, and many other small boats.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) According to a certain Japanese military base, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing has been coveting Japan for more than a day, so in addition to Kunming as its base, it has also established intermediate bases in Guilin and Chongqing, and has also established forward bases in other places in an attempt to take the opportunity to raid the Japanese mainland and cut off the Japanese army's support routes. However, since July, their attempt has been crushed due to the continuous attacks on their bases by the Japanese Army Air Force. At the same time, due to the loss of a large number of aircraft and airmen, their strength has also been eliminated. Therefore, it has recently been reported that Stilwell and other leaders have flown to New Delhi, or are consulting with the Southeast Asian anti-Axis military command to reorganize the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing and replenish personnel and equipment.</p>
<p>The U.S. Air Force Operates Independently</p>
<p>Moreover, Chongqing has witnessed the U.S. Air Force's disastrous defeat and is even more disappointed with it. They are increasingly pessimistic about the future of the war of resistance. According to Chongqing's hopes for the United States, the sixth is to supply aircraft and equipment to rebuild the Chongqing Air Force. However, the United States did not respond to Chongqing's request and sent its own air force to station in Chongqing, thereby seizing Chongqing's air power. Since then, the Chongqing army has only been responsible for building bases and performing ground service work, while the U.S. military has exclusively handled the operations and has not contacted the Chongqing Military Commission. In this way, Chongqing's face of independent resistance has been completely lost. When the U.S. Air Force first arrived, Chongqing expressed its welcome and provided the U.S. air force with all the conveniences for combat, such as building bases, communication facilities, and meteorological observation, with the Chongqing army undertaking all ground services, and military and civilians from all over the country mobilizing to provide thoughtful hospitality in order to establish goodwill. However, as a result, the U.S. Air Force never contacted the Chongqing army, which greatly disappointed Chongqing. The reason for this is not the secret operations of the U.S. Air Force, but the fact that they do not regard the Chongqing army as a true ally. To this day, the U.S. Air Force has never jointly operated with the Chongqing army and has not provided any assistance to the Chongqing army. For example, when Japanese aircraft attacked Guilin at the end of July, the U.S. Air Force abandoned the Chongqing Air Force and fled on its own. Such selfish behavior is even more obvious in their daily lives, so it has formed a target of resentment among military and civilians from all over Chongqing.</p>
<p>Severe Lack of Manpower Replacements</p>
<p>When various places in Chongqing are feeling the lack of food, the U.S. Air Force uses a large number of transport planes to transport food, cigarettes, and alcohol from India, but all of these are for their own enjoyment. When the plague was prevalent around Guilin, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Guilin only cared about its own safety and never cared about the Chongqing military and civilians. In addition, due to the arrogance and violence of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, its military discipline has become even more chaotic. The prostitutes in Guilin, Kunming, and other places are almost exclusively patronized by U.S. Air Force soldiers. Their tyranny cannot be described in words. Recently, because they have repeatedly suffered defeats and there is a severe shortage of manpower, they have made Chinese airmen who have been trained in the United States join the team. However, these measures have further revealed their selfish nature. The working hours of Chinese airmen are much longer than those of Americans, but their salaries are only one-fifth of those of Americans. All aspects of food and accommodation are inferior to those of Americans, so the Chinese people's antipathy towards them has been increasing.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Nakazono Dies Heroically</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) The Japanese Ministry of the Army announced on the 19th that Lieutenant General Nakazono Moritaka has been serving as the commander of the front-line air force since June of last year, commanding the Japanese Air Force stationed in Chongqing, curbing the U.S. and Chongqing Air Force's rash actions, crushing the enemy's ambition to conduct air raids on the Japanese mainland, and establishing special merits. Lieutenant General Nakazono died heroically in early September while fighting enemy aircraft in South China. In addition, the staff officers of the corps, Lieutenant Colonel Miyazawa Hiroya and Major Takada Masami, also died because they were on the same plane as the lieutenant general.</p>

<p>Fines for Police Violations Increased Fivefold</p>
<p>Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The application of the Law on Penalties for Violations of Police Regulations is originally closely related to the Criminal Law. The penalties stipulated therein serve the same function as the penalties prescribed by the Criminal Law. Currently, the fines stipulated in the Criminal Law have already been increased fivefold, while the fines for violations of police regulations remain at one cent or more and fifteen yuan or less. This not only violates the principle of consistency with the Criminal Law, but also, under the current standard of living, this minor amount is difficult to achieve the effect of punishment. This is the first point that urgently needs to be revised. The Law on Penalties for Violations of Police Regulations stipulates that a fine of one yuan can be commuted to one day of detention, while the Criminal Law stipulates that one yuan or more and three yuan or less can be converted into one day of labor. A comparison of the two shows a clear imbalance. This is the second point that urgently needs to be revised. The food rations for detainees in various police agencies are used under the item of fines for violations of police regulations. Recently, the price of grain has risen daily, resulting in insufficient expenditures. This is the third point that urgently needs to be revised. At this police administration meeting of the Ministry of Interior Affairs, various provinces and cities raised proposals to increase the fines for violations of police regulations by five times in accordance with the wartime sentencing of fines, in order to meet the current needs. Based on the above reasons, the Ministry of Interior Affairs has specifically drafted temporary measures for wartime sentencing of fines for police violations and submitted them to the Executive Yuan meeting for decision. The 183rd meeting this morning has already approved them.</p>
<p>Organizational Regulations of the Cooperation Affairs Committee</p>
<p>Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - China's cooperative enterprises have always been considered backward.

<h3>The General Office for Rice and Grain Purchasing and Sales Terminates All Operations; Interview with Responsible Person of the Ministry of Food</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) - All work of the Rice and Grain Control Committee is currently being actively promoted. However, the full-scale purchasing work has yet to be fully established due to the internal organization, so it still needs a little time. The pharmaceutical affairs of the General Office for Rice and Grain Purchasing and Sales of the Ministry of Food will be terminated by the 20th of this month. Therefore, all parties are particularly concerned about whether the distribution work of all parties will be interrupted during this transition period. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically visited the responsible person of the Ministry of Food yesterday to inquire about the Ministry's policy on the distribution of all parties during this transition period. According to him: The original agreement with the Rice and Grain Control Committee was that the conference would be responsible for the distribution of all parties starting in October. However, due to the cumbersome procedures, the preparations have not yet been completed, and the Ministry has been repeatedly requested to continue to maintain it. In addition, all parties are concerned and firmly advocate temporarily maintaining the status quo. For the sake of the overall situation, the Ministry will make preparations for the allocation and distribution, which has already been approved. The quantities include: Military and police rice until December; Rice for the citizens of Nanjing and Shanghai can be maintained until November; Each meeting city clearing unit to October; Rice for official residences and civil servants until November. The reason why the Ministry is allocating and distributing such quantities is to allow the Rice Control Committee to have ample time to make full preparations. However, since the original business closures have ended, we sincerely hope that the Rice Control Committee will start purchasing and continue the distribution as soon as possible to ensure that the food and military rations of the people are not interrupted.</p>
<h3>U.S. Treasury Secretary Arrives in North Africa; Will Inspect the Battlefield</h3>
<p>Amsterdam, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Washington report: U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and several of his financial experts are currently on a battlefield visit. Morgenthau, along with his private secretary Smith and currency expert Weitz, arrived in Algiers on the 15th.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - American opposition to Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's proposed tax increases continues to intensify. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and his financial experts Weitz and Smith flew to the front lines for inspection. It is reported that the three arrived in Algiers last Wednesday and are expected to travel for several weeks. At the same time, the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington has also joined the opposition to Morgenthau's tax increase plan. The association said that Morgenthau's plan is unsound, impractical, and can be described as fantasy. If taxes must be increased, it is advisable to increase retail sales tax. However, First Lady Roosevelt said that she has always opposed the retail sales tax system because it will affect those with low incomes.</p>
<h3>Germany Achieves Major Victory in Air Combat with Flame-Throwing Cannons</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - In the battle between the Allied Air Force and German-held Schweinfurt, approximately 140 bombers were lost, causing great shock to the American people.

The German forces achieved such a victory in this battle with new weapons."</p>
<h3>Intense Battles in the Dnieper River Basin; German Troops Still Firmly Defend Positions in Kremenets</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Berlin dispatch: The Soviet offensive on the Eastern Front has stagnated in the Dnieper River basin, and the war situation has changed in recent weeks. However, since the 15th, the Soviet army has launched a fierce attack in the Kremenets area, and the war situation has become tense again. According to the German authorities on the 16th, the intensity of the offensive has been unprecedented since the Soviet summer offensive. The offensive has lasted for three days, not only has it not weakened slightly, but it has become even more intense, and the progress of the situation deserves attention. According to the Soviet military's attack point, it is located in the area north of Chernihiv, the area south of Smolensk, and the area southeast of Velikiye Luki, especially the offensive in the Kremenets area is the most intense. At the moment, the Soviet army is continuously moving out of the bridgehead on the right bank of the Dnieper, and a large number of tanks and mechanized units are trying to break through the German positions, but according to the German authorities, their strategic breakthrough operation has not been successful. The current labor is, in the event that the Soviet army bypasses the rear south from the Kremenets area after the bend of the Dnieper River Bay, not only will the German army under Marshal Manstein in the south be caught in a difficult situation, but the German positions in the Crimean Peninsula will also be threatened. However, the German authorities believe that it is not yet time to express their opinions on the evolution of the battle situation in that area, so they are currently taking a very calm attitude. As far as the climate is concerned, it is now mid-October, and rain has been falling everywhere on the Eastern Front, but this is not the official arrival of winter, and the Soviet offensive cannot be stopped by this.</p>
<h3>Focus of Italian Theater Shifts to Central Mountain Region; German Delaying Tactics Effective</h3>
<p>Rome, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Havas report: It was learned yesterday that the Berengeri troops continued to move to the southern front.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A special correspondent for the German News Agency in the Mediterranean region said: The British and American military operations in southern Italy are now focused on dealing with the German front in the Apennine Mountains. The war activities on the two wings of the coast have gradually decreased on Sunday, apparently due to the extremely difficult transportation encountered by the enemy in this area. The German military's tactics in the past few weeks have made it virtually impossible for the British and American forces to use the north-south highway. These highways are almost completely damaged by mines or other explosives and are unsuitable for use, so the anti-Axis forces cannot advance rapidly. The characteristics of this strategy can be seen in the battle northeast of Capua at the entrance to the Apennine Mountains on Sunday. There, the British and American forces, especially near Gaster, tried to break through repeatedly, but were blocked, and the enemy suffered heavy losses. The German flat-shooting artillery and anti-aircraft artillery destroyed four British armored reconnaissance vehicles and three tanks. At the same time, the British and Canadian forces tried to open the highway from Fucha to Rome, but were also blocked by the German army. It was difficult for the enemy to seize a part of Bellano in the Apennine Mountains. However, when the German army carried out the bravest attack from the mountain head positions overlooking from near Bellano, the enemy was defeated, and several British and Canadian troops were cut off and captured. At the same time, several wounded enemy soldiers were also captured in the area.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Havas military visitor Settoris said: The characteristics of the southern Italian events at the end of last week have not changed. The German army is still resisting the advancing enemy army with a delaying strategy with a small number of troops. Although the troops are small, they can often give the enemy a powerful blow. Northeast of Capua The enemy suffered heavy injuries under the German army's strategy. The German army's use of long-range artillery also contributed. The intensive artillery fire for several days finally prevented the enemy from deploying on the northern bank of the Volturno River. According to the German war report on the 17th, the German rearguard had withdrawn from the Volturno and Apennine Mountains, The troops withdrew northwest and north to Qunqia Tuolo and Ganpobasu. The progress of the British and American troops in the above two districts was only a few kilometers, and the losses were extremely heavy. The Allies are still encountering our army's confusing strategy and cannot see where General Kesselring will feel and where the main force will work. At the end of the week, the enemy was still greatly replenishing its troops. The US 5th Army had removed the troops on both wings of Qunqia Tuolo and devoted itself to the westward advance. However, since the transportation along the way had been destroyed, it was extremely difficult to transport heavy military equipment. Therefore, the British and American forces The two wings and the middle wing did not cross the mouth of the Fuliang Tuonuo River, namely the line of Kayer Caisailueto, Qunqia Tuolo, and Ganpobasu, and the war on the eastern wing remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>German Sweep in the Balkans Proceeds Smoothly</h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Expanded German News Agency: In the past few days. The two major sweeping operations by the German army in the Balkan region south of the Danube River have proceeded smoothly and successfully. The purpose of this operation was to track down the guerrillas in the Farasgar Mountains. After the Cossack volunteers launched a fierce attack on the guerrillas, they had been driven away and 800 guerrillas were captured. On the battlefield, an equal number of bandits were also eliminated and many other war trophies were captured. According to reports, many of the bandits killed each other, and the Party and communists often had conflicts. This shows that the British are becoming less interested in Serbia as a country under the pressure of Moscow. Other sweeping operations in the Saluo Mountains of Slovakia are also continuing. The German army is working with the local guards to eliminate the enemy. The work is mostly imported at night. A hospital full of bandits and other secret armories full of military supplies have also been occupied. One bandit has taken advantage of the darkness to go unnoticed. In the search for the remains of 230 people, we escaped to the mountains and took the wounded bandits with them. There were 300 bodies on the battlefield and 1,800 prisoners, most of whom were seriously injured. The vehicles used to secretly transport party members were also captured.</p>

Finally, preparatory committee members from various regions, including Nanjing, delivered responses. After the meeting, a plenary session of the preparatory committee was held for informal discussions, where Chairman Yuan provided detailed instructions on future business directions. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese and Japanese Officials Attend and Provide Guidance</p>
<p>The leading officials from various agencies who attended included Chen Guangzhong, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Chinese Materials Control Review Committee, representing Zhou Fohai, Chairman of the Committee; Xu Shaoxiu, representing Mayor Chen; Sun , Director of the Social Welfare Bureau; Chen Riping, Director of the Economic Department of the First District Administration; Shao Xilian, Director of the Zhejiang Province Food Bureau; Chen Siming of the Zhejiang Province Blockade Management Office; Okazaki, Counselor of the Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office, representing Minister Tajiri; Kinoshita Isamu of the Deng Unit; Iwai Noboru, representing the Shanghai Army Unit; Yoshida, representing the Director of the Shanghai Special Municipality Liaison Department; Wangcun and , representing the Director of the Zhejiang Province Liaison Department; and Yoshida, Naval Attaché in Shanghai.

<p>Chairman's Address: Collective Effort</p>
<p>Respected officials, representatives, guests, and preparatory committee members: Today marks the meeting of the preparatory committee for the regional purchasing merchant associations of this committee. I am deeply grateful for the presence of all the officials, leaders of various agencies and organizations, and representatives from all sides, which demonstrates their enthusiasm for our committee. I am also pleased that all the preparatory committee members from the regional purchasing merchant associations, regardless of distance, have also attended, which demonstrates their commitment to their work. Since the beginning of preparations for this committee, four or five weeks have passed. During this time, we have received guidance from various parties and assistance from friendly officials and people from all walks of life. In particular, I am grateful for the presence of friendly officials who have traveled from afar. Furthermore, through the efforts of all the staff of this committee, the various important internal operations have finally begun to take shape. Most of the preparatory committee members of the regional purchasing merchant associations have undergone legal reviews and guarantee procedures and have been recognized as qualified by this committee. From now on, they will proceed according to the business accumulation stipulated by this committee. Therefore, we have specifically convened the regional preparatory committee members of this committee to gather, so that everyone can exchange opinions, connect with each other, and at the same time ask all the officials and representatives for guidance. Rice and grain are the source of life for the people, and as the saying goes, "Food is the people's heaven." Its importance is self-evident, especially at a time when the Greater East Asia War is actively unfolding. "Sufficient food and sufficient troops" are important conditions for establishing and protecting the country. This committee is entrusted by the central government and expected by the people of the whole country. On the one hand, it bears the responsibility of maintaining the people's food supply, and on the other hand, it has the responsibility of adapting to the wartime system. This dual responsibility is of utmost importance. I am of ordinary talent and shallow experience, and I am deeply afraid that I will not be able to fulfill this task. I hope that Chinese and foreign officials, leaders from all walks of life, and people from all sectors of society will provide long-term guidance and assistance. At the same time, I hope that all the preparatory committee members in the region will work together to share the responsibility of this committee. The first step is to "fulfill our duties," and the second step is to strive for excellent results, so as not to disappoint the government and the people. I sincerely look forward to the early success of this committee and the regional preparatory committees with a passionate heart.</p>
<p>Mayor's Instruction: Solve the People's Food Problem</p>
<p>Xu Shaoxiu, representing Mayor Chen, delivered instructions, saying: Today, the Grain Control Committee is convening a general meeting of the preparatory committee for regional purchasing trade associations. I am honored to represent Mayor Chen in attending and meeting with everyone. In view of the sound organization of past rice and grain purchases, the National Government has strengthened the procurement organization and established the Grain Control Committee to handle purchasing work. I believe that the people's food is the most important issue, and I hope that all preparatory committee members will work together under the assistance of the government, the Grain Control Committee, and friendly forces to achieve satisfactory results and solve the problem of military supplies and people's food. This is my hope for this conference.</p>
<p>Minister Tajiri Hopes for Cooperation</p>
<p>Okazaki, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy, representing Minister Tajiri, delivered a speech, saying: Today, I represent the Embassy to say a few words to you. The key to ensuring military and civilian food is the active purchase of rice and grain. The Chinese and Japanese governments have entrusted the Chamber of Commerce Control Committee to organize the "Rice and Grain Control Committee." The previous results of rice and grain purchases were not satisfactory. This time, the Grain Control Committee is responsible for breaking through the difficulties in purchasing. I hope that the Chinese and Japanese sides will work together to achieve good results in the purchase of rice and grain. I also hope that the rice and grain control mechanism can lead other control mechanisms. This is the main point of my hope today.</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Kinoshita Awaits the Grain Association</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Kinoshita, Commander of the Deng Unit, delivered a speech, saying: The total amount of production in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces is sufficient to supply both military and civilian needs, which has been generally confirmed. The food problem in Central China is definitely not due to insufficient rice production, but rather due to the poor management of past purchases and transportation, as pointed out by various sectors. Therefore, the success of solving the food problem depends entirely on the completion of the purchase and transportation tasks. This is what the military expects from the Grain Control Committee. The impediment to the efficiency of past rice purchases was the excess and profit of intermediaries, and the suppression of prices, which caused farmers to be unwilling to sell. This time, the Grain Control Committee will directly purchase from farmers and decide on fair prices for distribution. The fair and appropriate distribution to farmers, merchants, and consumers is a major determination for the future.</p>
<p>Major General Ota Expresses Hope</p>
<p>Major General Ota delivered a speech, saying: I hope that the staff of the Grain Control Committee and everyone will support this great work with morality. The military will provide as much assistance as possible. If difficulties arise, I hope that you will contact the military to complete the mission.</p>
<p>Speech by Unit Commander Takagi</p>
<p>The main points of the speech by Unit Commander Takagi: I am very pleased that the Rice and Grain Control Committee has been fully established and that procurement has begun under Chinese-Japanese cooperation. Since ancient times, there has been a saying that "when clothing and food are sufficient, people will know etiquette." Ensuring rice and grain is not only crucial for the stability of people's livelihoods and the progress of culture, but also an important undertaking to achieve the victory of the Greater East Asia War for lasting world peace. The complete solution to this problem is the greatest responsibility and the most honorable undertaking of the Rice Control Committee. Since this committee is established through Chinese-Japanese cooperation, its success will demonstrate the achievements of Chinese-Japanese cooperation and shared hardships. It is hoped that in the same region, both Chinese and Japanese parties will procure simultaneously and cooperate to overcome various difficulties and achieve the greatest results. In order to complete the rice procurement, it is necessary to obtain the assistance and cooperation of all relevant Chinese and Japanese agencies and units and to maintain close contact. Chinese and Japanese merchants should unite strongly and work hard under the guidance of the highly respected Chairman and Vice Chairman to complete the mission, so as to ensure the sound development of the Committee.</p>
<p>Director Chen Riping of the Economic Department Speaks</p>
<p>Chen Riping, Director of the Economic Department of the First District Administration, said: Today, officials from various agencies, friendly forces, members of the Grain Control Committee, and preparatory committee members from various exploration offices are all present. I am honored to be present at this meeting. Due to time constraints, I will not elaborate. My only hope is that everyone will step up their work, strive to purchase, and receive the assistance of friendly forces and military police to achieve a bright future.</p>
<p>Representative Thanks and Urges Continuous Supervision</p>
<p>Xiao Yicheng, representing the preparatory committee members from various regions, replied: Today, the preparatory committee members from the regional purchasing trade associations are holding a meeting in the main hall of this committee. We are honored to have officials and friendly guests present to provide guidance and give instructions. We are deeply moved by your words. In the future, we will follow the instructions of the officials and strive to implement them. However, the work of rice and grain purchasing is very heavy, and our strength is very weak. We hope that the officials will supervise us at any time and provide guidance so as to avoid failures.</p>

<h3>Teachers and Staff of 72 Municipal Elementary Schools Petition</h3>
<p>In the past, the teachers and staff of the 72 municipal elementary schools in this city had extremely low salaries and high living expenses, making it difficult to maintain their livelihoods. They had previously requested assistance from the Municipal Education Bureau.

At the beginning of this month, the Bureau received an order from the Municipal Government to increase the salary of teachers in various municipal elementary schools to 330 yuan, and the salaries of directors and principals were also increased accordingly. However, after only a few months, the cost of living has soared, making it still ineffective. Therefore, Director Lin of the Municipal Education Bureau is actively planning to improve the treatment of teachers and staff in various schools. The teachers and staff of the 72 elementary schools, who are already under pressure from their livelihoods, jointly dispatched a representative from the principals and a representative from the teachers and staff, a total of more than 100 people, and submitted a petition to the Education Bureau for assistance, requesting an increase in the treatment of teachers and staff and office expenses. Director Lin Jiongan of the Municipal Education Bureau received them at 9:00 AM yesterday, offered many words of comfort, and promised to forward the request to the Municipal Government and enact laws to improve treatment in order to maintain education.</p>

<h3>Controlled vs. Non-Controlled Commodities Chamber of Commerce Releases Distinguishing Names A Total of 26 Main Controlled Commodities</h3>

However, some citizens are not very clear about what are controlled commodities and what are non-controlled commodities, and how to transport them. For this reason, the reporter specially went to the Chamber of Commerce for inquiries. According to the person in charge of the association, the main commodities currently controlled by the association total 26 items. Within the Shanghai area, except for cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and cotton, which cannot be moved temporarily, the rest can be moved freely within the city.

<h3>Prerequisites for Increased Production</h3>
<p>Yesterday, it is the responsibility of the industrial sector to strive for the advancement of business and the increase of production, so as not to disappoint the expectations of investors. However, to seek an increase in production, it is necessary to solve the problem of raw materials for factory production; the raw materials for factory production are mostly agricultural products. In recent years, prices of all commodities have risen, and the cost of farming for farmers has also increased accordingly. The cost of agricultural products this year, according to the recent estimates of the China Economic Research Association, has increased up to three times more than last year. The livelihood of farmers depends entirely on the income from agricultural products for support. If the purchase price of agricultural products is excessively lowered, it will inevitably cause losses to farmers, thereby discouraging them from engaging in farming. The old saying "cheap grain hurts farmers" serves as clear evidence. Therefore, to increase production, it is necessary to first encourage the increase of agricultural products.</p>
<p>The most effective way to encourage agricultural production is to raise purchase prices. For commodities such as cotton and grain, procurement was once difficult due to excessively low prices. Recently, the authorities, recognizing this, have gradually increased the purchase prices of cotton and grain, both to show consideration for farmers and to facilitate procurement. This kind of nurturing policy is most appropriate.</p>
<p>In addition, there are two other things that can directly promote the increase of agricultural products. One is agricultural loans, with various banks organizing syndicates to carry out agricultural loan work. All aspects, such as improving seeds, purchasing fertilizers, and improving rural life, are promoted through agricultural loans. The second is land reclamation, which is promoted by the government and expanded in scope at any time and any place. For example, the recent initiative by the Construction Department to divide and cultivate farmland along the shores of Taihu Lake can be said to be an excellent policy direction. It provides direct assistance to the production increase movement.</p>
<h3>Various Trade Associations in the City Actively Develop Association Affairs; Reorganization and Consolidation Work is Ready</h3>

It is estimated that there are about 300 trade associations in this city, and each association is now actively developing its affairs.</p>

<p>The evaluation committees established by various trade associations are dedicated to evaluating the prices of various commodities in their respective industries. In order to strengthen these institutions, the associations will not only have directors and supervisors of the associations serve on the committees, but will also invite experts in the industry to investigate the raw materials and costs of various commodities, and set fair price limits. To assist the evaluation committees in setting price limits, investigative teams will also be established, dispatching staff to secretly investigate whether stores and retail departments are complying with the price limits.</p>
<p>Purchasing Raw Materials</p>
<p>The raw materials needed by various industries were previously procured individually by each business from the producing areas. However, the control of material movement has been very strict recently, making procurement not only difficult but also causing substantial freight costs. Recognizing this, some associations will apply for assistance from the authorities to purchase raw materials in bulk from the producing areas for their members, transport them to Shanghai, and then distribute them to the individual members.</p>
<h3>Paint is a Major Commodity; Businesses Should Join the Trade Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Chamber of Commerce recently received a report from the Coarse and Fine Paint and Sundry Goods Trade Association stating that since paints have been exempted from requiring permits for transportation within the three provinces and two cities, and sundry goods are not subject to control, a small number of businesses that do not need to move materials within the city believe that whether or not to join the association is irrelevant to their interests and are delaying joining. It asked how to correct this. The Chamber of Commerce for Trade and Industry sent a letter to the Commercial Control Council for a reply. According to a reporter's investigation, paints are included in chemical industrial products and have been classified as major commodities by the Ministry of Industry. According to Article 13, Paragraph 2 of the Provisional Regulations for Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations, companies and firms engaged in major commodities may not operate without joining the trade association. Trade associations should guide non-member businesses to join the association in accordance with the law, or report to the competent authority to order them to join the trade association in accordance with Paragraph 1 of the same article. The Commercial Control Council has sent this intention to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for handling.</p>
<h3>Egg Supply and Demand in this City; New Institutions Will Be Established; Strict Control Will Be Implemented</h3>
<p>The price of eggs in this city once soared sharply. Upon investigation, the reason was actually due to the monopolization by unscrupulous merchants. It was found that the relevant authorities in this city had established specialized agencies for the control of eggs, but all aspects were not sufficiently strict. Therefore, unscrupulous egg merchants still had room to operate. The authorities believe that the rise in egg prices is of great concern to people's livelihoods, so they are paying close attention and are trying to suppress it. Recently, the First District Public Office has set price limits for various types of eggs, and retailers are absolutely not allowed to exceed the price limits, otherwise they will be severely punished. It is now learned that the authorities will not only regulate the price of eggs but will also strictly control the supply and demand aspects.</p>
<p>Controlling Buying and Selling</p>
<p>In order to make the control work effective, the authorities will establish a new control institution. Everything is still under consideration and research by the relevant people. This institution will implement reasonable and proper control over the import and market trading of eggs. In the future, all movement of eggs, whether moving them in or out, will require an egg transportation permit issued by the authorities.</p>
<p>Distribution Ratio</p>
<p>The demand for eggs in this city is very large, and the monthly import volume is very considerable. The import and distribution of eggs will be jointly undertaken by the Japanese and Chinese sides. The Japanese agency in charge is the Japanese Egg Industry Federation, and the Chinese agencies are the National Egg Industry Federation and the Shanghai Egg Industry Association. Regarding the distribution of eggs, the Japanese and Chinese sides will also follow a reasonable ratio. The Japanese side will account for about 60% of chicken eggs, and the Chinese side will account for 40%. For duck eggs, the Chinese side will account for 60%, and the Japanese side will account for 40%.</p>

<p>Translated Commentary</p>
<h3>Rice Appraisal and Food Production Increase</h3>
<p>In peaceful areas, increasing food production is an important issue. Although the purchasing problem is also important under social conditions, the fundamental goal is to increase production. Only with excellent agricultural production can the food problem be fundamentally solved.</p>
<p>It was recently rumored that the Suzhou Rural Clearing Cooperative and the China Cooperative Guidance Committee convened a Rice Production Increase Appraisal Conference to encourage rice production increases. This is indeed a meaningful move, and its results are highly anticipated.</p>
<p>Of course, the problem of increasing food production cannot be solved by appraisal conferences alone. The fundamental requirement is the necessity of large-scale planned practice. The main purpose of the appraisal conference is to address the issue of variety improvement in the production increase policy. While improved varieties can certainly increase harvest yields, the fertilizer problem is also extremely important and cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>According to the research results of ordinary people, the characteristics of rice in Central China are quite similar to those in Japan. In the future, the rice production increase policy in Central China can refer to Japan's past experience as a basic direction for improvement.</p>
<p>Rice cultivation in Taiwan is currently very abundant. They have adopted two strategies: one is to switch from indica rice to japonica rice, and the other is to implement chemical fertilizers. According to their experience, fertilization has little effect on indica rice, while it is most suitable for japonica rice. Fortunately, the Qingxiang area in Central China is mostly a japonica rice area, so there is no need to change varieties, and the fertilizer policy can be implemented directly, which should achieve satisfactory results.</p>
<p>In addition, Nanjing has a large-scale chemical plant with production equipment and nearby pyrite mines, which are excellent conditions. Needless to say, the relevant parties should provide as much assistance as possible to develop them, so that the chemical fertilizer policy can be implemented. As a result, rice can increase dramatically, not only solving the food problem but also providing a solid foundation for the vast farming population. The agricultural policy can naturally be promoted smoothly. (From the Dalu Xinbao, October 16)</p>

<h3>German Army on the Eastern Front Adopts a War of Attrition</h3>
<p>Currently, the German army is implementing a decisive and implicitly historical retreat operation on the Eastern Front. The operational front extends 1,300 kilometers from Dmitriev, north of Smolensk, along the Dnieper River to the Sea of Azov. Regarding whether the retreat operation, which has relied on the natural barrier of the Dnieper River for three months, is coming to an end, the German authorities are not making predictions, and the Soviet side is also taking a cautious attitude. In short, both armies have not been able to obtain a positive or negative conclusion on the outcome of the Dnieper River campaign from the current war situation, which is probably the current truth.</p>
<p>In fact, the battle situation of the Red Army's extra-large bridgeheads and the Dnieper River crossing operation is unprecedented in strategic locations such as Zaporozhye. The Red Army is determined to make a breakthrough near Kiev. However, while retreating, the German army repelled the Red Army's offensive, leaving deep trenches in various places on the east bank of the river, forming a tortuous battle line like a winding river. The Red Army, which occupied the strategic position of the , used the Red Army's bridgehead as a target and has been constantly waging fierce battles since September 28. It is rumored that the Red Army has successively reinforced seven infantry divisions in the Zaporozhye area.</p>
<p>Soviet Food Shortage</p>
<p>Following the German-Soviet war, we can first find that the so-called Soviet winter offensive and German summer operation formula has been completely broken, because the Soviet Union has already launched a full-scale offensive in the summer. This is primarily because the Soviet Union is eager to solve the food problem, and regaining Ukraine is essential. Secondly, it is feared that the Red Army's weapon production will not keep up with the speed of German production as the war drags on, so as soon as the good opportunity for the British and American landing arrives, it will launch a tragic decisive battle. In any case, the Soviet Union's approach of sparing no lives or materials and launching an all-out war has indeed surprised both friend and foe alike.</p>
<p>Now, from the Yelsk area, one can already hear the cry of, "Is it still potato soup today?" It is said that due to the shortage of bread, Soviet workers are gradually showing signs of fatigue and weakness. After repeated conscriptions, the factories have almost become a world of women. Not only that, even the front lines have seen the emergence of women's aviation regiments that have undergone one year of training.</p>
<p>Although the headquarters still implies today that German and German resources and resources are abundant, to encourage the world of public opinion to re-examine the nature of its non-European war, the Red Army's 180-degree turn in the summer offensive, if launched by the Soviet Union's already depleted war potential, then the judgment that the Eastern Front is facing an important milestone is not necessarily impossible.</p>
<p>German Army Saves Strength</p>
<p>Moscow announced that, because the muddy period has arrived, a special intermediate corps composed of the elite of the Cossack soldiers and the Siberian cavalry combined tank unit has handed over to the summer assault vehicle. The Red Army's current advantage is indeed an undeniable fact, but even the British and Americans do not believe the interpretation of the German army retreating under pressure. Therefore, we acknowledge that the German side has a planned retreat. Moreover, if the next stage of operations is considered, it is necessary to prevent the loss of people and materials.</p>
<p>That is to say, on the one hand, it is considered to prevent reckless operations of bloodshed for every inch of land, and on the other hand, it is the most effective means to deal with the Soviet guerrilla war. Gai Shibencai is particularly committed to the special strategy for the Soviet Union, and even the Soviet guerrilla team has now completely abandoned the scale of the previous special detachment and has become a mobile surprise force. For example, a military force that forms a connection line behind the German army, and has aircraft, artillery, and tanks is free to come and go, and launches a large-scale rear disruption war.</p>
<p>Then, related to the above, shrinking the battle line, reorganizing it, and at the same time thickening the defensive line, and maintaining close contact with the strategic reserve force, is also very necessary to consolidate a strategically advantageous position. Regarding this strategic thinking and war situation, we must admit the German army's cleverness in decisive battles. If the war cannot end within the year, it is certainly necessary to complete various preparations for the next stage of operations and gain time. What's more, for planned retreat operations, the Soviet Union often encounters large-scale encirclement and annihilation battles by German mechanized units, just like past offensive operations. According to Red Army prisoners, the German rearguard units, which were sent down like feathers, cleverly launched multiple encirclement battles against the Red Army. Therefore, the losses given to the Soviet Union are said to be a total of 2 million casualties, a loss of 20,000 tanks, and approximately 10,000 aircraft. Compared with the losses suffered by the Red Army in the German summer offensive, this is certainly not much, but looking at the current combat power, its proportion to the Soviet Union is definitely not inferior to the past two years. Looking at the German army's losses, taking tanks as an example, it is only 10% of the Soviet Union's. From this, one can measure where the German army's purpose in this operation lies.

<h3>Opinions on Teacher Subsidies, Part 1</h3>
<p>This time, the municipal authorities, in order to sympathize with the difficult lives of teachers, decided to allocate a huge sum of 500,000 [currency unit] per month to subsidize the faculty and staff of private primary and secondary schools. This measure is, of course, one of good governance. As I was writing this article, I saw in the morning newspaper that the subsidies would begin to be distributed starting on the 20th of this month. From my personal point of view, regarding the distribution of this subsidy, and standing in the teachers' position, I have some opinions and suggestions for the authorities.</p>
<p>How to Deal with Those Holding Concurrent Positions? The distribution of this subsidy does not distinguish between primary and secondary school teachers; each person receives one share, and those holding concurrent positions are not allowed to receive more than two shares of the subsidy they deserve. The method is originally very fair, but there are many teachers who hold concurrent positions. It is possible that some people use clever methods, such as one person using two names to hold courses in two schools, and perhaps even the schools are unaware of the details. It is naturally not easy for the authorities to investigate. Regarding this point, I hope that within our group of teachers, we will conduct strict investigations and surveillance. Once discovered, even if it is a friend, we must report them without hesitation. Because this subsidy of 500,000 [currency unit] is allocated based on the number of people, if someone receives an extra share, it will cause everyone else to receive less. In other words, they are concurrently receiving what belongs to everyone, so we cannot tolerate not reporting them. At the same time, I hope the authorities will issue a clear announcement that any teacher who is dishonest and concurrently receives subsidies for more than two positions will, once verified, be permanently suspended from receiving the subsidy.</p>
<p>Principals Should Not Be Included in the Subsidy. The so-called subsidy refers to subsidizing the faculty and staff of private schools. Therefore, in name, even if the principal does not hold a teaching position, they are still one of the staff members and can receive the subsidy. However, most private school principals in Shanghai have made a fortune in the past few years and do not need the subsidy. Therefore, I believe that anyone who is a principal should not receive the subsidy. Because in the past two relief efforts, as I know, some wealthy principals also took a share without hesitation, and even took more than the teachers.</p>
<p>Who is Responsible for Not Submitting the List?</p>
<p>The method for distributing the subsidy this time is that each school first submits a list of faculty and staff to the authorities, with a deadline of the 15th. If the list is not submitted by the deadline, it will be considered a waiver. Then, the authorities will calculate the reported lists and use them as the distribution standard. I have heard that in addition to most schools complying with the order and submitting on time, a few schools disregarded the interests of faculty and staff, and the list was not submitted, causing the subsidies that the faculty and staff should have received to be shared among others. Who should be responsible for this? I believe that the principal should be required to compensate the faculty and staff in full and issue it according to the monthly payment schedule; otherwise, this loss is too meaningless.</p>
<p>Mid-Term Resignations Should Be Returned. Many faculty and staff of private schools resign mid-term, especially in recent years. When encountering faculty and staff who are in school at the time of reporting but resign in one or two months, if someone replaces them, the subsidy they should have received should naturally be received by the replacement. However, sometimes their position (teaching) does not involve hiring a new person and is covered by colleagues in the school. I believe the subsidy that should have been received must be returned. It should be temporarily kept and allocated by the authorities for the subsidy in the next semester; otherwise, the principal will definitely take it, which is unreasonable and inappropriate!</p>
<p>In short, with the large number of teachers in the city, the result of distributing this 500,000 [currency unit] subsidy is that each person receives a limited amount, a drop in the bucket. Although it cannot be called relief, the distribution method should be fair, so the above points should also be noted. (Seeking Innovation)</p>
<p>Part 2</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Administration, in order to relieve the lives of teachers throughout the city, has decided to allocate 500,000 [currency unit] per month as a subsidy. The authorities' allocation of relief funds to teachers is of great significance for valuing education and cultivating the foundation of the country, which need not be elaborated on. However, there are often things in the world where "a good author does not necessarily make a good ending, and a good beginning does not necessarily have a good ending." There are cases where the result and the motive go against each other, and there are cases where the result is affected by negative influences. For example, the aviation construction lottery, which promoted aviation and consolidated national defense, had good intentions. However, the impact was to promote the people's mentality of luck, and although national defense was strengthened, it was still a loss.</p>
<p>There was a precedent for teacher relief funds in this city before. At that time, the education community did receive some benefits and was very excited. However, there were differences in quality, disparities in the amount, and other kinds of drawbacks, which caused some people to complain. Therefore, I would like to raise some questions for the authorities to consider before the relief funds are allocated:</p>
<p>The distribution of relief funds should be based on the exact number of teachers, not on the scope of the school.</p>
<p>Primary, middle, and high schools should be distributed universally, striving for uniformity, and should not be different. The work of primary school teachers is more burdensome than that of teachers at other levels, while the treatment is the opposite. Therefore, the levels of primary, middle, and high schools should be broken down.</p>
<p>The distribution should be evenly distributed among the faculty and staff of each school, and there should be no differences based on different positions. Last time, the director of education at a certain elementary school received 800 [currency unit], while the teachers only received about 200 [currency unit], which is really a joke.</p>
<p>Are school staff included in the scope of relief? In principle, school staff are lower-level workers in the school, and their contribution to education is no different. Their lives are perhaps even more difficult than those of teachers, so they should also be included in the scope of relief. However, there are many schools that are becoming like families, often with four or five servants, while only one or two are truly serving the school. Therefore, when providing relief to school staff, it should be given to those who truly serve the school, and should not be issued indiscriminately. In the past, the mother of a certain school principal cooked (for fear that the nanny would waste food) and the nanny and driver all received relief funds, which ran counter to the original intention of the country to provide relief to faculty and staff, and should be severely criticized.</p>
<p>Principals and some superfluous positions should not share the benefits. Because principals have more affluent lives and superfluous positions receive rewards without merit, they should all feel guilty in their hearts, and even if the authorities do not have this regulation, they should voluntarily give up the benefits. (For example, if the principal's wife serves as the accountant, she can be regarded as a superfluous position).</p>
<p>The above is about the distribution of relief funds itself. Now there are some additional problems that arise because of the relief funds, which are even more related to the future of education, so I would like to elaborate on them:</p>
<p>Relief funds are a passive way to improve the lives of teachers, a so-called expedient measure, a last resort. Moreover, with so many people, the amount allocated is a drop in the bucket. How much can it help with the high cost of living? Therefore, I must loudly appeal: strictly establish a public school economic system. If the authorities of each school do not implement it voluntarily, it should be enforced by the administrative authorities. As for how to make the economy public, it is not within the scope of this article, so I will not elaborate.</p>
<p>The purpose of allocating relief funds is, of course, to hope that the education community can settle down in teaching and improve efficiency, but it is difficult to guarantee whether the results will be as we expect. Therefore, I believe that a portion of the relief funds should be extracted—or it is best to raise funds separately—to be used as education incentive funds. According to the methods of the Jiangsu Education Department before the war, telegrams should be sent to adjust course papers to test the diligence of teachers' teaching. Various competitions and joint examinations should be held to distinguish the merits of each school's performance. Supervisors should be sent to inspect schools at any time to clarify the implementation of each school's situation. Those who are diligent, excellent, and well-implemented should be given bonuses and other honorary rewards; conversely, they should be given appropriate punishments. This is called encouraging and inspiring them, which can achieve more rapid efficiency than simply providing relief funds. (Zhang Qiyang)</p>
<h3>Social Service Shanghai YWCA Fundraising Rally Opens</h3>
<p>In the past year, the Shanghai YWCA, in order to adapt to the needs of the environment, has paid special attention to constructive and educational social relief undertakings in addition to its regular work, such as nurseries, voluntary education for female workers, student relief, voluntary schools for girls, and the donation of winter clothes to the poor. Recently, it has also taken over the Children's Home (i.e., the children's shelter), which specializes in accepting stray, lost, evicted, and runaway children. In addition to improving them, it also focuses on cleanliness, hygiene, moral education, and vocational education, hoping to transform each child into a normal and useful child from the psychological and physical transformation, benefiting Shanghai. In order to continue to promote various undertakings, a fundraising rally was held, with a target of one million [currency unit]. It opened at the Bank Club at 4:00 p.m. yesterday. It is said that this fundraising is being promoted by 100 enthusiastic social workers. It is thought that with everyone's help, the goal will definitely be reached.</p>
<h3>Illness Caused by Eating Sand Another Fact</h3>
<p>I read in your newspaper's service column about the impurities in Mr. Chen's rice affecting his health, which is alarming. My two-year-old son suffered from abdominal pain on the 9th of this month and died on the afternoon of the 10th. His illness was indeed an acute gastrointestinal disease. Because I always thought that children's illnesses were mostly caused by fright, I did not diagnose it correctly and delayed seeking medical treatment, ultimately leading to his death. Tracing the cause, it was also caused by the black fine stones in the broken rice that caused his death. However, the deceased is gone. I hope that the grain administration authorities will, in the future, most importantly remove the black fine stones from the broken rice to protect the people's lives, which would be a great merit. On the one hand, I also hope that most rice merchants will consider ethics and benefit future generations. (Shen Shigui)</p>
<h3>Sympathizing with Impoverished Teachers Donations and Charity Sales</h3>
<p>I read the article "Teacher's Appeal" in your newspaper's social service column and deeply sympathized with him. I immediately went to Mr. Fan Mingxing's residence to investigate. The situation in the room was shocking, and the emaciated appearance of his couple and young children was extremely impoverished. It is already a problem to make ends meet, let alone the huge cost of medical treatment. In addition to paying for miscellaneous expenses, I have now obtained the consent of my friend Dr. Sun Dingyuan to provide voluntary check-ups. (Mr. Sun is a doctor at Guangci Hospital, and I have introduced him with a letter.) After confirmation, treatment will be carried out immediately. In addition to my own commitment to cover part of the medical expenses, Dr. Sun is also enthusiastic and willing to bear the remaining expenses. This enthusiasm is commendable and rare. Although Mr. Fan's medical expenses have been resolved, his family's daily expenses still need assistance from enthusiastic people in society so that Mr. Fan can focus on seeking medical treatment. (Yu Wo)</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw the article "Teacher's Appeal" in the social service section. After reading it, I deeply sympathized with Mr. Fan. I also have a fellow villager and friend, Mr. Yu, who is also a middle school teacher. His body is weak, and he has been ill in bed for more than a month. His family is destitute, and his five family members are starving all day long. Not to mention the cost of medical treatment, his sad situation is no less than Mr. Fan's. Although I do not know Mr. Fan, my heart of sympathy and compassion is the same. Now I am willing to donate a Qing Dynasty Yunsi "Ma" [currency unit] worth 8,000 [currency unit] for charity sale, with 2,000 [currency unit] of the proceeds to be given to Mr. Fan to express my meager sincerity, and the remaining 6,000 [currency unit] to be given to my fellow villager and friend Mr. Yu for his living and medical expenses. The size of the [item] is extremely large and rarely seen on the market. It is quite magnificent and is very grand as a gift for high-ranking officials. There is no shortage of charitable gentlemen in Shanghai. If you sympathize and help to complete this good deed, I will also feel the same.
