<h3>從華北災賑說到辦賑的先決條件</h3>
<p>— 張一鵬</p>
<p>這一回華北四省災情嚴重，待賑孔亟，以國民政府軫恤的殷勞，上海民衆援助的然烈，給我們十分深切的感動。雖然，我們現在亦正因爲物價層漲，糧食奇缺，有朝不保夕的過慮，可是比較華北災民，還在天堂之上。倘再專顧自己，漢不關心，不要說因果報應的迷信話，就照孟子所說披髮繼冠的道理，也不能無動於中。所以，這一回軟的成績，必有可觀，但是有了款項，就要辦賑，這辦賑却不是一件容易的事。從前上海著名的辦賑家，前有施（子英），盛（杏蓀），後有馮（夢花），朱（子橋），施朱兩　，辦賑的經過，散在筆記，一時難以聚覽。盛馮兩氏，多有文稿行世，我想搜集些材料，供給這一回辦賑的參攷。</p>
<p>賑有三大類，一曰春賑，二曰冬賑，三曰急賑。春賑重在施放種籽；冬賑重在施放衣粥；急賑必須購齊糧食，刻期運到災地，故非先有墊款之人不可。捐款收集，往往參差不齊，稍一遲延，農民坐以待斃，必然勞而無　。而且次年因無人種出，必然繼續吿災，辦急賑頂有名的莫過於盛氏，他就是用墊借的方法，像他掌管的電報局，招商局，中國通商銀行，多是他的外府。就是度支部的大淸銀行，郵傳部的鐵路局，常常奏明政府，分頭轉撥（愚齋存稿初刊）。固然，盛氏當時的地位魄力，說得到做得到，可是籌擬調度的心血，亦費了不少呢！然而，這種急賑籌款的辦法，還有缺點，數額太大，墊借的人不放心；數額太小，放賑的地方不殼普遍。此其一。銀行必需利息，無形中打了折扣。此其二。捐款還債，少則無人負賣。此其三。要避免種種麻煩，莫善於發行公倩，公債總額，不妨稍大，定爲分期發行，假定一萬萬元的債額，可分爲四期：第一期四千萬，第二第三第四期，則爲二千萬，看辦「的程度需要而爲伸縮。有人說，公債印票編號，費時過多，緩不濟急，不知發行公債，先給收據，在一定期內，憑據換票，從前早有成案。且承銷必委托銀行錢莊，分散出據，尤非難事。又有人說，公債必有擔保，政府將多一筆支出，不知民爲邦本，旣未能防患未然，又不能全力救濟，道担保的責任，似乎不便推諉。况擔保款項，可以指定一種稅源，即創立一種附加稅，只要大公無私，自亦不傷政體。持有公款的買戶，可以同其他有價證券，流通市面，並可作防止通貨膨脹的效用，一舉而數善備，或者也是千慮一得的方策。</p>
<p>辦賑最難的，莫如查放，查是調查戶口，放是按戶給放。查放不得其人，不但效果毫無，甚至無從收拾。查放的人，大致可分首要及次要兩種：首要必須廉潔公正，廉潔不獨不要錢，不舞弊，就是別人一樣用一個錢，我却比他多用些，亦不算數，吾鄉馮林一（桂芬）先生親筆書聯，懸於各善堂，聯語是「揮霍公財，天誅地減；」「侵呑善款，男盜女娼。」他會說過侵吞善款，鄉黨自好者不爲，至於揮霍公財，人人不免。譬如公家的信紙信封，用以寫私人的函件，也就是揮霍。這是何等的嚴格。公正尤其是最要的條件，施子英氏在寳坻縣查賑，有許多孤兒寡婦，包　索賑，施氏查有數家，藏諸糧米，確非亟貧，但彼輩宣鬧不已，施氏即當衆說道：「若調孤兒寡婦皆須吃賑，則當今皇上皇太后亦要吃賑耶？」（光緒初年事故云）所以我拿廉潔公正希望賑務首要的各位。至於次要的人，是要能吃苦，能服從，這種人雖在全部進行中，居次要的地位，若論賑務的完成，卻全靠他們負起力量。他們要曉行夜宿，他們要挨饑受餓，他們要在貧民窟裏遊行，他們要肩挑背負一家一家的分送，如果不能吃苦，如何做得到呢？聽說朱子橋氏在陝西親自放賑，卻被半路上的飢民，把一担饅頭，盡行搶光，　撕破了衣服，抓破了手指，這多是常有的事。還有施放口糧，必須遵從隊長的指揮，否則影響全部工作，非常重大。</p>
<p>說了半天，還是說到本題，華北災賑，當然是急賑。倘十天半月之內，慕到相當的數目，那是最好，但是公債的事，也情願備而不用，况且要替他們豫備籽種，豫備工賑，甚至還要豫備冬賑，用錢的地方多得狠呢！至於查放，亦應該早早設計，依我的愚見，似乎應該在首都組織一賑濟總所，在冀北，魯東，晋南，豫北各組織一分所，每一分所，設正副主任各一人，即就該省官紳各選一人充之，尤須訪求從前辦賑經騐的人，搜羅廣普，使分頭隨查隨放，以期早日觀成。</p>
<h3>日俄戰役　三十八年前本報之紀載　舊報新抄　（三）</h3>
<p>引言</p>
<p>我們認淸今後保衛太平洋，將全是亞洲人的責任，再不容許英美揷足侵略勢力。不過，克盡保衛的任務，端賴强大的海軍力量。友邦日本建立海軍，歷數十年辛勤經營，不斷精進。在三十八年前的日俄戰役中，以寡克衆，初露頭角。此次大東亞戰爭中，更發揮了所向無敵的威力。而目前太平洋整個防務，由友邦海軍獨任艱鉅，我們未能稍爲分勞，殊深愧怍。因此，我們今後將如何以友邦海軍爲模範，建立中國新海軍，參加防衛太平洋的任務，實爲國人所應共同急起直追的努力目標。本報爲增進國人海軍知識與興趣，特將三十八年前日俄戰爭時本報紀載，摘爲新抄，自廿一日至三十日止以十日爲期，尙祈讀者注意爲幸。</p>
<h3>中國不能堅守局外中立之例說　（載本報第一一〇八二號光緒三十年正月十一日西曆一九〇四年二月二十六日禮拜五）</h3>
<p>凡甲國與乙國兵釁旣開，爲鄰邦者，旣不助甲，亦不助乙，若是者謂之守局外中立之例。公法家亦謂之非敵。從前歐洲如瑞士，比利時，塞爾非亞，呂桑堡等國，皆遵此例。蓋因瑞士地居要隘，法·德·奧·義四面壤地相接，其境內江河又皆由瑞士山嶺發源，扼守邊要，殊非易事。瑞之遵守局外甚關大局，若不守之，亦難免自危也。比利時左法右德，歷來爲諸國戰塲，至一千八百卅一年倫敦之約，各國令其恒守局外，以期永免戰爭。塞爾非亞之守局外，自一千八百五十六年巴黎之約始。呂桑堡則由一千八百六十七年倫教之約始。要之，所以守局外之故，蓋有二端：一由自行揆情而甘爲之；一因鄰邦關係甚鉅，由鄰邦立約，令其遵守。惟旣經申明爲局外中立之意，必須確守其局外中立之規，斯爲合於公理，否則即難免爲敵國輕視，而自失其利權。今者日俄兩國，旣以干戈相見，互啟兵端，歐洲各國，大半守中立主義，中國亦已明降諭旨，謂日俄均係友邦，應按照局外中立之例辦理。夫以勢力相敵之國，而遇爭戰方劇之時，自顧兵備未能雄强，自不能不置身局外。惟欲守此例，亦非易事，其大要有二：一不可自棄戰；一不可或有偏倚。按丁氏所譯公法會通第七百四十三章云：局外者，不必先以戰權相推謝。解者謂：邦國間有恒守局外，而仍不棄其戰權者，無戰權，則無以衛法而自護；無以自護，即失其爲自主之國矣。第七百四十八章云：局外恐戰國犯其疆界，恒有設兵防堵，謂之持兵旁觀。解者謂：調兵防堵等情，不得作爲預戰論，蓋意在保守其局外之權利而巳。邦國不能執兵自護者，即難免戰國之乘機侵犯。觀此二節，可知中立之國，雖不與聞其戰事，實不可自棄其戰權。當日俄未開戰之先，中國政府或主聯俄，或主聯日，意見旣各不同，議論因之而異。迨夫兩國釁端旣啟，政府雖自表中立，宣吿各邦，然窺其意旨，畏俄之心，較畏日之心爲尤甚。邇者因俄國滿洲兵艦停泊滬江，上海道旣援據公法迫令於二十四點鐘內離開中國所轄海面，而俄使藉口保護俄國官商之語，商准外務部，竟允停泊江心。夫兩國旣經開戰，無論何國兵艦，均不得駛人局外之國口內停泊，此公法所應爾也。如謂官商恐遭不測，則保護之責，自在中國，何可遽允俄艦停泊其間，若敵國之在境內募兵與夫華民之私行接濟，凡一切關係軍情之舉，利於此國而損於彼國者，萬一不及覺察貿然爲之，彼此責言之來，庸詛能免。然則局外中立之策，行之亦豈易事哉？倘當事者恃有成約在先，不復於此中留心措置，吾恐禍患之來，在於眉睫，而中立之局，仍將不能長恃矣。</p>
<h3>日報述旅順史書臺形勢　（載本報第一一一一〇號光緒三十年二月初九日西曆一九〇四年三月二十五日禮拜五）</h3>
<p>日本大阪某日報云：不論何國，凡扼要關隘，皆禁人用攝影法映照形勢，以故砲臺所在，外人不得而知，獨俄人軍律不嚴，將士疏懈，以致旅順砲臺圖式，得入我日本軍士手中。中有數臺，明係華人所築，後經俄軍葺治，煥然一新。總計各處砲臺，約有三十座。其在老虎尾半島者，名曰威遠。此外，如心雞頭，如高山，如蠻子營，如饅頭山，如城頭山，共得六座。老虎尾威遠一臺，面臨大海，由是迤　達西南之老鐵山，綿綿不斷。老鐵山砲臺在旅順尖角處，老虎山之麓。黃金山一臺爲諸砲臺中最大者，其地處老街之南，與老虎尾對峙。旅順口門有一角突出，迤東南及正西，各有砲臺二座。正西各臺總稱黃金山砲臺，猶之老鐵山諸裏總稱老鐵山砲臺也。黃金山之東，牧猪礁砲臺，分建營壘二。牧猪礁東北則爲崎峍嘴砲臺。以上諸臺，皆面臨大海。此外，新街之後椅子山，松樹山，二龍山，亦有砲臺圍護，以防敵人自背後來攻。椅子山分築鞍子山望臺二砲臺，藉以控制東方。松樹山砲臺，則又在椅子山之東，又東則爲二龍山砲臺，又東則爲雞冠山，太波山，蟠桃山緒砲臺。此皆用以防敵人自新街之東暗襲者。新街之西，則爲楊家屯，太家屯，其地在鳩灣附近，亦新築砲臺，但未吿竣。其已成及繕修完備者，是計二十六臺，至業已度定地形，方在鳩工庀村者，亦復不少。當日軍第四次進攻旅順時，毀於砲火者，即威遠及蠻子營二臺，蓋因老虎尾半島直對海洋，以致臺旣傾　，砲座亦皆欹側也。</p>

<p>東京二十二日中央社電　日政府決定國葬山本元帥後，其國葬費決自許通會計第二預備金項下支出。日閣議二十一日通過支出國葬費九萬五千元，經由大藏省支配。</p>
<p>東京廿二日中央社電　日山本元帥之壯烈殉國，日本全國產業戰士，無不深爲悲痛，決心益加努力，各就本位，繼續爲國服務，以慰故元帥在天之靈。同時日本一億國民之必勝信念，亦愈趨堅强，尤以直接從事軍火生產之工人，更爲悲憤，愈認欲慰故元帥之英靈，惟有竭力增加生產，日產業報國會，現有鑒於此，爲發揮產業戰士之決意，擬舉行各種提高戰意行事，決定於故元帥國葬之日，全體工人，將一日所得，捐獻海軍省，其具體辦法，最近即將通知全國各產業報國團體，以使實行。據小畑產業報國會理事長談稱，山本提督此次於南方最前綫，躬親嚼戰，不幸壯烈殉國，實足證此次戰爭之熾烈，同時吾人更應一新作戰決意，俾慰故元帥英靈，因此更應提高戰意，努力打倒英美，產業報國會擬於此際籲請全國軍火工人，努力增產飛機，以期提高戰爭精神，其具體方案，正在研究中，目下全國產業戰士，敵愾同仇之心，實已更趨高昂。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城廿二日中央社電　據紐約來電，前美聯社東京特派員巴布談，日山本元帥陣亡事，謂日同盟社廣播中，謂日本聯合艦隊司令長官山本提督陣亡，因山本提督之死，日海軍已喪失一最有能力之指導者。山本提督思慮周密，剛毅磊落，於此次大戰中，斷然採用新戰術，故實爲日海軍界之傑出人才，攻擊珍珠灣之計劃，諒即山本提督所擬定，山本提督爲日本認海空兩軍有一體協力必要之第一着，其於世界上，或亦爲最初之人物，渠使海空兩軍充分發揮協力效果，渠藉攻擊珍珠灣及馬來海戰，已使日海軍制壓自西太平洋以迄印度洋之廣汎地域。吾人雖不明山本提督死後日海軍受何等影響，但日海軍指導部組織之有如機械，實非其他國家作戰部所能及，山本大將雖極偉大，然於日海軍全體，實無甚影響。</p>

<p>短評</p>
<h3>敬悼山本元帥</h3>
<p>前日本聯合艦隊司令長官山本大將，在最前綫的戰役中，壯烈殉職。噩耗傳來，全亞洲震悼。不但日本全國人民，因景仰山本元帥生前的功勳，而致衷心痛悼。就是我們中國人民因爲山本元帥是防衛太平洋，解放亞洲人的自由，一旦失了領導者，也同樣的衷心痛悼。</p>
<p>古人云：「人固有一死，死有重於泰山，或輕於鴻毛。」今山本元帥爲盡忠國家，保衛東亞，以身殉職，可謂重於泰山之死。軍人原有「視死如歸」之氣槪，殉身疆塲，引爲光榮。所以在元帥本人，已是「功成身殉，俯仰無怍」了。</p>
<p>日本海軍中，固多傑出將才，以爲過去及今後海軍史上創造光榮業績。可是，我們更覺得日本海軍「經歷數十年不斷磨練，已培養成萬衆一心的傳統精神，成爲整個海軍堡壘。」這是日本海軍特色的地方。所以，山本元帥殉職，日本海軍界固然失一傑出將才，而於整個海軍力量，決不因之見遜。相反的，足以激起日本海軍全體將士更高的「同仇敵愾」心理，而加緊擊滅敵人，以繼山本元帥之遺志。我們敬以萬分同情，哀悼山本元帥之殉職；更以萬分熱情，期待日本海軍之勝利。</p>

<h3>阿圖島日軍士氣旺盛　反擊美軍予以重創　東岸上陸部隊已遭完全擊滅　北岸美軍增調兵力企圖南犯</h3>
<p>東京廿二日中央社電　美軍於本月十二日，在阿圖島上陸後，邇來該島日守備隊士氣愈趨旺盛，刻正不分晝夜，實行猛烈反擊。美於東岸上陸被擊滅後，現該方面已無敵影，然美軍現亟逐次向該島增强兵力，日守備隊正於東部地區陣地，繼續猛烈反攻中。美方關於阿圖島方面戰况之發表，常以日方發表爲轉移，觀十八日美海長諾克斯會見記者時所談，可知於阿爾茲灣（北岸）及馬薩加灣（南岸）上陸之美軍部隊，現在企圖會師，然遭日軍猛烈反擊，已受創。敵方消息幷盛傳日守備隊勇猛反擊，該方面美軍將兵，因此次上陸作戰所受犧牲，實較南太平洋戰綫方面，尤爲慘重。</p>
<p>東京廿二日中央社電　大本營谷萩報道部長，本日就阿圖島方面戰况發表談話如次，（一）於阿圖島南岸上陸者，似爲敵軍主力，其兵力漸次增强，五月十六日以後，有坦克車及重軍需品搬運上陸。（二）於北岸上陸之敵軍，逐日增强兵力，刻正向南方進犯，圖與由南岸上陸部隊取得連絡。（三）東岸方面，因五月二十二日我軍勇敢逆襲，將敵上陸部隊擊滅，故該方面已無敵影。（四）敵兵力約爲一個師團，由有力之艦隊及航空部隊護衛，並備有坦克車及重砲，我守備隊於五月十六日夜撤退前哨部隊，據守該島東部地區陣地，於敵軍猛烈砲擊下，以寡兵對抗優勢敵軍，對之加以反擊，予以極大損害。據自該方面所得報吿，我部隊長以次將兵，士氣極旺盛，大有凌雲之概，世界精銳無比之日軍眞精神，已充分表現無遺云。</p>

<h3>制空與海上戰局　（一）</h3>
<p>— 佐藤喜一郎　譯自改造五月號</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰開始時，飛機的任務完全是偵察敵情的，德軍開戰時企圖突破比利時的列日要塞而向法國領土進攻，最早發現這企圖的，是法軍的飛機。</p>
<p>「德軍約十軍已侵入比利時，向列日急進中。」</p>
<p>以當時的飛機而言，這是極有價値的報吿，但法軍總司令霞飛絕對不相信。因爲他不但不顧一切地直進，將德軍的實力佔量過小，而且祇相信十萬騎兵的偵察。可是這騎兵隊，那時還全然沒有探知德軍的侵入比利時。—這是戰爭開始時法軍敗退的主要原因。</p>
<p>至八月下旬（一九一四年），英軍飛機發現德軍第二軍自不魯塞爾向格拉門前進中，九月上旬又偵察德第一軍在馬爾魯會戰的行動，將各種重要的情報供給本部。霞飛鑑於前次列日的陷落，這時就相信飛機的報吿而爲指導作戰之基礎。</p>
<p>相反地，因相信航空偵察而使戰局有利的例子，是馬爾魯會戰後立刻發生的莫爾太紐作戰。加斯台爾諾率領的法第二軍正面的德軍，因爲留下極少的兵力而將主力移動於主力戰方面，所以第二軍飛機探索敵軍已退却四十公里至五十公里，根據這報吿，加斯台爾諾於三十分鐘後發前進命令，獲得了莫爾大紐的勝利。</p>
<p>那時的飛機，雖然器械不完全，駛駕技術紡稚，可是已有了不可蔑視的功績；但正因爲飛機專主於偵察，所以在戰爭初期，戰鬥和轟炸還沒有作爲戰術而出現。待至後來戰綫固定，兩軍據戰壕而相對峙，飛機的拽索就全無需要，至多也不過以砲兵的觀測射程爲主要任務。</p>
<p>轟炸隊的出現，是一九一五年五月，以負轟炸德國軍需工廠之使命而產生的法軍四個大隊爲　矢，勃柴型飛機十八架空襲羅特維斯哈芬的工廠，震駭了德意志全國。這最初的轟炸，法軍不過因發動機發生障碍，而失掉一架飛機？</p>
<p>繼續轟炸加爾斯羅漢，又得到了意外收獲，四個轟炸大隊歸一個指揮官統制，計劃專在法國領土以外活躍，法國空軍正要達到滿足的頂點時，不料急轉直下，竟至迫不得已陷入絕望的極底裏了。德空軍突然出現了戰鬥機。如果遇到速度很快，操縱性柔軟而又輕快的戰鬥機。最後法軍飛機從頭起就要中機關槍彈。以單機出動時，在大隊中落伍時，或經過航空路綫時，法軍一定不能飛囘。遠距離飛行對於法國空軍似乎需要可怕的代價的。那年八月轟炸柴爾勃留克，瞬息間被擊落轟炸機九架。</p>
<p>一時在空中高視闊步的法國空軍的轟炸機，這樣地不得不逐漸沒落了。於是德軍戰鬥機代之而起，榮耀地振揮機翼君臨於彼此之上空。這是世界戰爭史上最初的掌握制空權。</p>
<p>不待言，法國空軍也立即創設戰鬥飛行隊對抗。然而，不久開始的威爾坦會戰，更決定了德空軍的制空權。德軍在威爾坦的正面集結優勢的航空兵力，一見法機，就派戰鬥機逐之於戰綫外，並在飛機塲動員砲兵，使其不能降下。</p>
<p>德空軍雖制威爾坦之空而得意攝楊，但在接着發生的聖摩會戰，爲新近整備的法軍獨立驅逐飛行隊奪囘了制空權。在德軍的聖摩會戰戰鬥報吿的一節中，有這梯的話：</p>
<p>「聖摩會戰的當初數星期間，痛切地感到我軍空戰中戰鬥兵力的劣勢。敵機實行遠距離偵察，有一切的自由，又賴其觀測偵察，敵砲兵完全壓倒我砲兵。」</p>
<p>制空權的獲得，不但決定飛機對飛機的優劣，而且給與她上全軍作戰以重大的影響，這是近來兩軍所互認的；衆認保持有力戰鬥飛行隊，是作戰上不可缺少的要素。同時戰鬥飛行隊的職任顯然有二：一是妨害敵飛行隊行動的攻勢上任務，一是保障我偵察機關自由防禦上的任務。</p>
<p>但至一九一七年，以愛露會戰爲契機制空權又歸於德軍之手。德軍極力改良飛機的質，增强飛機的量，可以說，法國空軍的行動幾被阻止。目覩着氣球連日爲德戰鬥機燒燬，法空軍無法可施，只在近距離的高空和低空中編隊飛行，設定沒有把握的安全地帶，辛辛苦苦地使飛機在其中活動着而已。</p>
<p>不但如此，對於勢衰命乖的法國空軍，也可以說是晴天霹靂的事件，是德軍在夜間使用轟炸機起來了。在以前，轟炸機是搭載力很小的複座機，夜間出動也只限於明月當空的晚上。最可怕的，是一九一七年夏季，德國新轟炸機以搭載量達六百公斤的雙發機，闇夜泰然實行空襲。黑暗的夜半，法國飛機塲，兵營，火車站及工廠等，到處遭森炸，所受的損害，竟是遂日增大。</p>
<p>其結果，法軍迫不得已分散飛機塲，改造並整備轟炸隊，至一九一八年，才能逐漸恢復制空權。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰時的制空權，在某個區域的某個期間內，被德軍所掌握；又在某個區域的某個期間內，被聯軍所掌握。地上的戰况，也隨之而繼續一進一退，但制空權不像現在這樣的左右了整個戰局。不消說，這是因爲飛機的威力不能和今日相比，數量少，就是在用兵這點上，也還沒有超脫初步的境界。</p>
<p>其後西班牙內亂時，德義蘇法英等國的飛機，也互相戰爭，但這戰爭，恰如各國飛機的實地試騐，不是國術館裏的躀跤的意識，就不會眞正參加空軍，這是當然的。</p>
<p>於是爆發這次大戰。</p>
<p>關於這次大戰一開始，德軍就在波蘭發動閃電戰，繼而衝進比利時·荷蘭，席捲法蘭西，佔領挪威，遜擊巴爾幹半島等戰役的空軍戰果，這裏不必詳細叙說吧。只是在次序上，要簡單地一瞥德國空軍在這些作戰中的活動，而且提及制空權對於本文主題的海軍作戰的意義。</p>
<p>德國空軍於一九三九年九月一日二日這兩天間，急速降下，集中轟炸波蘭飛機塲三十五處至三十處，消滅了波蘭所有的航空兵力的四五％（據法國計算爲二〇％）。總而言之，開戰第一日早已獲得了制空權。</p>
<p>接着進駐荷蘭·比利時·法國北部之時，也和波蘭作戰採取同一戰法，在地上部隊之先，迅速出動轟炸機，只在三日間，給英法空軍以致命的打擊，把握了西部戰綫的制空權。現在將德國空軍的作戰行動同顯起來：</p>
<p>一，賴空戰或攻擊航空根據地而獲得了制空權；其次，賴空運軍隊及降落傘部隊，而佔據了飛機塲及其他戰略要地。局時轟炸航空工廠及防空設施。</p>
<p>二，炸燬鐵路，汽車等地上運輸機關，及船舶，港灣設施等，以妨害英法兩軍的移動和集中。</p>
<p>三，掩護機械化部隊，和地上部隊密切聯絡，而轟炸要塞，裝甲車部隊，地上部隊的駐囤地點，司令部所在地等，範圍極廣，重砲不能攻擊時，越益發揮轟炸機的威力。</p>
<p>四，爲要防護聯軍轟炸友軍的集結地區和司令部，講求一切方法。</p>
<p>五，賴遠距離轟炸而轟炸產業中心地，人口稠密地等，企圖動搖敵方國民的精神。</p>
<p>進攻第一日的五月十日（一九四〇年），一日炸燬飛機塲一百處，截至開始進攻巴黎的六月五日爲止，敵機之被擊落或擊破者，在飛機塲有二千一百架，空戰有一千二百五十架，這時，德機對於一處飛機塲大致以十五架至十八架襲擊之，以投五十公斤的炸彈爲主。</p>
<p>對於這樣輝煌的德國空軍的活躍，英法空軍做了些什麼呢？英法空軍雖不得不有下面的這些行動，却無一是做得很滿意的。</p>
<p>一，保持空軍活動力；</p>
<p>一，連絡在戰綫中的地上友軍；</p>
<p>一，和地上防空陣合作；</p>
<p>一，妨害敵方的鐵路及公路交通；</p>
<p>一，轟炸敵方的軍需工業地及軍事設施。</p>
<p>而且全軍的組織力有缺點，喪失綜合的敏捷行動性，只有一部分部隊，實施了上面所說的一兩個任務。</p>
<p>開戰第一日，還在熟睡中的英法將士，到傍晚爲止，損失精銳飛機一千架，士氣完全沮喪了。這是西部戰綫失敗的原因之一；對於德軍是證明閃電戰的成功。但是英國空軍不想攻擊德國降落傘部隊，却忙於轟炸直接無關戰局的運輪機關。十二日只襲擊了華爾哈培飛機塲的運輸機五十架，和離向伊亞北方十二公里的飛機塲的空運部隊。一方面，法國空軍第一日已失掉蹶起的務望，剩下的零落不全的舊式轟炸機，又遭德國空軍襲擊，在地上三百架，在空戰七十架，都被擊落或擊破了。戰爭開始時掌握制空權，怎樣可以支配整個戰局呢？這是一個極好的實例。</p>

<p>短評</p>
<h3>歡迎谷大使</h3>
<p>日本駐華大使谷正之氏，於蒞任以後，即遄程來滬，昨日並由田尻公使招待本市各界奧谷大使相見，我們於歡迎之餘，並誠摯的貢獻三事，以代表中國人民致贈谷大使的敬禮。</p>
<p>（一）日本開始實施對華新政業時，谷大使正任外相，對於新政策的決定與推行無疑是致力獨多。今復出使中國，對於促進此後兩國間的協力，更無疑是將盡最大努力。這是値得慶慰的事。但是，我們更覺得新時代外交方向，必須聽取駐在國民衆的呼聲，以爲措施的根據。自從中日事變以還，和平區內民衆靜默了多年，直到日本轉變對華政策以後，民衆才漸漸透露了心坎裏的呼聲。願谷大使多多聽取這種呼聲，也就是接近中國民衆的最好機會。</p>
<p>（二）目前中日之間，尤其是中日人民之間的情感，已有顯著的好轉。不過，我們也不能忽視。足以阻滯進一步好轉的障碍，尙未完全消滅，尤其是易被忽略的「小節」。嘗聞很多的中日人士說：「大政策已經轉變了，小節是無關宏指的」。然而，我們的主張，適得其反，「大政業」與「小阻碍」，要平行調整，「小的不留神，號誤了大的」。這是最不幸的事，願谷大使重視此點。</p>
<p>（三）中國華北各省目前災荒嚴軍，待賑殷切，我們已經連日提出在急賑進行中，有待日本駐華各當局的給予充分便利協助之處甚多。願谷大使格外寄予同情，除轉請各地日本當局給予賑務上便利以外，更盼倡導日本僑華人士，慷慨惠賜捐助，使華北千萬災民，深深感念谷大使以及日本僑華人士的恩惠。</p>

<p>經濟界　經濟界歡迎</p>
<h3>商統會改隸行政院</h3>
<p>商統會改隸行政院後，滬經濟界極表歡迎，僉以爲過去不特商統會之行動，受實業部糧食部及其他機關之指揮監督，而新同業公會，亦歸兩部直接組織，因有此種繁複之指導監督機機，以致商統會成爲中間機構，自聯合會公會紛紛成立後，亟須調整，明定監督系統，俾得完成商統會之使命，商統會理監事會鑒於此情，亦曾呈請國府改善此點，商統會之意見，即可代表上海整個財界之意見，故國府准其所請，實行調整，將商統會改隸行政院，本市經濟界對此一致支持。商統會旣歸行政院節制，預料其理監事會等，亦將俟機改選，調整內部組織。</p>
<p>相信商統會之今後自主組織工作，將適應現實而行，如組織方針與現實不符，則對於推進新統制工作上，反有弊害，在原則上絕對有改革之必要，但不能操之過急，必須循序而進，總之，此次之改隸行政院，已將商統會組織工作上之障碍掃除，必有飛躍發展之可能。（雲鵬：譯自五月二十二日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>銀業業各行荘　內移游資復興農村</h3>
<p>銀錢業各行莊鑒於自全國商統會成立後，各地物資之搬運，除規定主要各物資須領搬移出入證外，凡未統制之物資，得自由運輸，茲爲促進上海與內地資金交流之活潑起見，進行下列各事：</p>
<p>調整匯率</p>
<p>調整國內匯兌率力求簡便，儘量承做，俾直接便利各地資金之調撥，匯率减低，旨在减輕人民及商業機關之匯款負担，同時並謀取華中經濟之健全發展。蓋目前中儲券之流通，已深入各地，而金融基礎之鞏固，爲導引上海游資入內地復興農村經濟，所以國內匯兌設法予以種種便利。最近因江浙春繭已上市，鉅額資金由上海流入內地，充收買春繭之用，同時內地小麥之登塲，爲期不遠，資金之內流勢必增加，並聞鉅額匯兌，須說明正當用途，如收購農產品等，目的爲防止內地資金之壅塞。</p>
<p>存款激增</p>
<p>自銀聯會通吿緊縮同業拆放，勸會員行莊保持實力，以策萬全後，各行莊均已充實本身準備穩健經營，對於一切貸放，不論抵押信用往來透支等，極端審愼，因此銀聯會會員同業存款愈見充厚。以本年三月而言，爲八〇五·七四三·一七二·五三元，三十一年同月五四五·八三三·八九一·四六元，三十年同月一九〇·八七五·〇七六·〇五元，二十九年同月七六·八八三·九一一·九〇元，二十八年局月八六·八九四·三二四·四二元，二十七年同月五九·三一八·四六二·五六元，二十六年同月九六·一九二·四〇一·一三元，二十五年同月一〇三·〇九九·六九四·七〇元，（按三十一年六月以前係以舊幣爲本位，以後係以中儲券爲本位。）</p>
<h3>華中電氣公司　第七屆股東會</h3>
<p>華中電氣通信公司，於二十一日下午二時，舉行第七次股東大會，全體股本與中日關係官方，該公司理監事準時出席，席間提出下列三項議案：（一）營業報吿及決算，（二）分配紅利，（三）監事二人任期已滿，關於其改選問題。第一議案，全塲一致通過，第二議案決定股息六歷，監事王建民，油谷恭一仍連任。（廿二日大陸新報</p>
<h3>棉花蔴類羊毛皮革　列入統制品中</h3>
<p>商統總會之物資統制審議委員會幹事會，於前日（二十）開會時，鑒於小麥麵粉雜糧油脂原料棉紗布牲畜肥皂洋燭火柴砂糖烟草等十一項物資之統制機構，業已組織完成，但棉花·蔴類·羊毛·皮革四項，因過去尙未列入統制品範圖以內，故議決請商統會追加列入，同時並由商統會從速籌組上列四項物資之統制機構。</p>
<h3>粉麥專業委員會　積極組織內部機構　組織油糧專委會尙在考慮中</h3>
<p>商統會粉麥專業委員會，於日前成立後，頃悉該會刻下正積極籌設內部之各項組織，其組織人員，大致係中日雙方之粉麥商人，而以華商爲主，日商爲副，聞該會之組織規章，即將草擬完竣。</p>
<p>華商粉廠準備復業</p>
<p>又悉，華商製粉廠停頓已久，此次次步入新經濟階段後，各製粉廠亦因華商粉麥商可參與蒐購小麥工作，故亦擬準備開工製粉，茲悉目下已經在籌劃復業者有筆豐製粉廠云。</p>
<p>油糧專會尙在考慮</p>
<p>此外前日各報載商統會擬設油糧委員會，組織系統大致已吿決定之新聞，頃據該會所云：商統會對油糧業是否需要組織專業委員會，尙在考慮之中，因專業委員會之設置，必須經商統會之核定，上項消息，並非誤會發表。</p>
<h3>華股趨勢</h3>
<p>昨華股跌勢漸勁，在一片賣出聲中，各股市價一致銳落。百貨業仍最虛軟，永安公司已跌入關內。新新與國貨成交不多，價亦挫落較微。紡織業永安紡織亦入大關，美亞綢廠稍低；內衣供過於求。亦見低落。大中華火柴起回風下挫，兩日來之買風消散。南洋及華成兩綢公司喊價都低。商務，中華，世界三書局少成交，賣戶亦稀，所跌尙徵。閘北水電與華商電氣亦見隨落。久安實業平疲。新益地產軋小頗巨。中聯電影有供無求。小票面之紡織業，亦在低落中。惟獨甫登塲之景福衫機廠與通易信託二新股，成交價尤比前日爲高，成交亦旺，至中紡，信和兩股票，聞即將在華股市塲正式開做。</p>
<h3>各業公會動態</h3>
<p>百貨業　百貨業聯合會，現已籌備就緒定本月廿八日飯新都飯店七樓舉行成立大會。</p>
<p>菸業　菸業聯合，定於本月卅一日下午三時在大西洋菜社召集全體曾員舉行成立大會，分函蘇浙皖區各地同業公會屆時推派代表一人至五人來滬出席，參加選舉理事，據記者向商統會方面探悉，各該同業聯合會組織機構完成後，即進行統制同業物資收買配給之任務云。</p>
<p>化學工業　化學工業同業聯合會，根據工商同業工會組織暫行條例通則，業已擬定其組織，定於二十五日下午二時假四馬路五洲藥房舉行成立大會，和平區各地所屬同業公會，將分派代表一人至五人來滬出席，該聯合會之單位同業公會，有左列六種，其組織工作，大體就緒：（一）化學工業原料廠業同業公會，（二）化學工業原料號業同業公會，（三）化學工業品業同業公會，（四）藥廠業同業公會，（五）新藥業同業公會，（六）顏料業同業公會。</p>
<p>橡膠業　上海特別市橡膠品號業同業公會，昨經召集人王靖東召開第一次籌備會議，並定五月二十九日假市商會召開成立大會，聞該會包括業務爲經營橡膠品鞋類·車胎·零件之商號，均應於五月二十六日前聲請入會。</p>
<p>綢緞業　本市綢緞號業同業公會亦經籌備就緒，定明廿四日假市商會舉行成立大會，討綸會章及選舉理監事。</p>
<h3>肥皂原料有繼</h3>
<p>本市肥皂價格，前因操縱，價格高出限價甚鉅，市民大感不便，後因製造肥皂之原料如椰子油等來源有繼後，各肥皂廠亦即復工生產，大量製造出品，致市上之肥皂價格，漲風頓吿抑止。最近實施新經濟政策後，製造肥皂原斜之來源，益爲便利，肥皂之產量，亦可更趨豐富，致連日肥皂之零售價格，亦在連續下跌中。</p>
<h3>銀行行員的生活</h3>
<p>— 紀小裳</p>
<p>在以前，銀行行員這一種職業是被人們目爲「銀飯碗」的優越的職位，有不少人羨慕着，有不少行將畢業的靑年學生想望着要獲得它；然而，在今日之下，銀行行員欲以其全部的薪水和津貼來養家活口，是絕不可能的事了。今昔相較，使人浩嘆。</p>
<p>筆者在一家歷史悠久規模宏大的商業銀行中服務，月薪六十元（月薪六十元的同人佔全行辦事員的大多數），連津貼一起，每月總收人共計九百元，午膳則由行方免費供給。筆者家中共有三人，不用娘姨，每月最省的開支亦需一千五百元，入不敷出的情形是顯而易見的。</p>
<p>這一千五百元的開支，包括房租，水電費，車費，糧食，煤球，食油，糖，鹽，肥皂，草紙等等，以及親友間婚喪時的「人情」，我們沒有娛樂費用，也不添置衣服鞋襪，也不購買書籍雜誌，祗是每天買一份申報閱看而已。偶有傷風暖嗽，頭痛發熱等小病，也不求醫診，最多買幾粒阿司匹靈或金鷄納霜丸服用。我們自己覺得，已經儘量節省了，但是，入不敷出的事實却是無可諱言，無法避免的。</p>
<p>筆者除服務於銀行外，並不兼任其他職務，所以沒有其他收人。公餘的消遣是：讀書，寫稿，洗衣服，訪親友，在馬路上散步，僅此而已，也沒有虛耗什麼金錢。每月理髮兩次，我想也不能再省了吧！</p>
<p>同事中亦有兼做生意，或買賣股票等賺些「外快」的；但是，筆者却沒有這種「外快」可賺。其原因：第一是沒有本錢，我家中的經濟狀况是很淸貧的；第二是不願做投機囤積這種事。</p>
<p>對於日用品，如肥皂草紙，油糖鹽，煤球等，都是到需用時方始購買，從未預先購置好一個月或幾個月所需用的數額。一方面固然因爲預先購置不免促成囤藏之風，另一面，筆者是希望物價漸漸低落。不料物價初不因當軸的宣吿嚴勵壓低而降落，却反日漸上漲起來。看看同事中有買好幾個月的日用品的，都省了好些錢，心中便覺得懊悔起來，回家後還受老母埋怨說：「叫你稍爲多買一些，你不聽，你看，現在又漲了！」我覺得：做人實在不易，做一個奉公守法，安份守已的人更難！</p>

<h3>Discussing Disaster Relief in North China and the Prerequisites for Organizing Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yipeng</p>
<p>The disaster in the four provinces of North China this time is severe, and relief is urgently needed. The deep concern of the National Government and the fervent support of the Shanghai people have deeply moved us. Although we are currently facing anxieties due to rising prices and severe food shortages, comparatively, we are still in paradise compared to the disaster victims of North China. If we only care about ourselves and remain indifferent, not to mention superstitious notions of karma, even according to Mencius's principle of "continuing to wear the hat while disheveled," we cannot remain unmoved. Therefore, the results of this soft approach will be remarkable. However, once funds are available, relief efforts must be organized, which is not an easy task. In the past, Shanghai had famous relief organizers, first Shi (Ziying) and Sheng (Xingsun), then Feng (Menghua) and Zhu (Ziqiao). The processes of Shi and Zhu's relief efforts are scattered in notes and difficult to gather at once. Sheng and Feng have many published manuscripts. I want to collect some materials to provide references for this relief effort.</p>
<p>There are three major types of relief: spring relief, winter relief, and emergency relief. Spring relief focuses on distributing seeds; winter relief focuses on distributing clothing and porridge; emergency relief requires purchasing and transporting food to disaster areas on a strict schedule, so it is essential to have someone willing to advance funds. Fundraising often proceeds unevenly, and any delay will leave farmers waiting to die, inevitably leading to fruitless efforts. Moreover, if no one plants the following year, disaster will inevitably continue. The most famous emergency relief organizer was Sheng, who used methods of advance borrowing. The telegraph bureau, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and Commercial Bank of China under his management were all his external treasuries. Even the Daqing Bank of the Ministry of Finance and the Railway Bureau of the Ministry of Posts and Communications often reported to the government and allocated funds separately (Yuzhai Collected Manuscripts, first edition). Of course, Sheng's position and influence at the time allowed him to say and do things, but the mental effort of planning and coordinating was considerable! However, this method of emergency relief fundraising also has shortcomings: the amount is too large, and those who advance the money are uneasy; the amount is too small, and the relief efforts are not widespread. This is one. Banks require interest, effectively discounting the funds. This is two. If the donation is too small for debt repayment, no one will be willing to take on the responsibility. This is three. To avoid various troubles, the best approach is to issue public bonds. The total amount of the bonds can be slightly larger, and they can be issued in installments. Assuming a bond amount of 100 million yuan, it can be divided into four installments: 40 million in the first installment, and 20 million in the second, third, and fourth installments, with adjustments made according to the needs of the "degree" of the relief effort. Some people say that printing and numbering public bond certificates takes too much time and is too slow to meet the urgent need. However, issuing public bonds with receipts first, which can be exchanged for certificates within a certain period, has been done before. Furthermore, underwriting should be entrusted to banks and money houses, which can issue receipts separately, making it even easier. Some people also say that public bonds require guarantees, which will increase the government's expenses. However, since the people are the foundation of the nation, if we cannot prevent disasters in advance and cannot fully provide relief, the responsibility for providing guarantees seems difficult to shirk. Moreover, the guarantee funds can be designated from a specific tax source or by creating a new surtax. As long as it is fair and selfless, it will not harm the political system. Holders of public bonds can circulate them on the market like other securities and can also help prevent inflation, achieving multiple benefits in one stroke. Perhaps this is a worthwhile strategy.</p>
<p>The most difficult part of organizing relief is investigation and distribution, where investigation means surveying households, and distribution means providing relief according to the household. If the investigation and distribution are not done properly, not only will there be no effect, but it will even be impossible to clean up the mess. Those involved in investigation and distribution can be divided into two main categories: primary and secondary. Primary personnel must be honest and impartial. Honesty means not only not taking money or engaging in corruption but also ensuring that one does not spend more than others, even if it is just a small amount. Mr. Feng Linyi (Guifen) of my hometown personally wrote a couplet and hung it in various charity halls: "Squandering public funds will be punished by Heaven and reduced by Earth;" "Embezzling charitable donations will lead to sons becoming thieves and daughters becoming prostitutes." He once said that embezzling charitable donations would not be done by those who cherish their reputation in the village, but squandering public funds is something everyone is prone to do. For example, using official stationery and envelopes to write personal letters is also a form of squandering. This is how strict it is. Impartiality is an especially important condition. When Shi Ziying was investigating relief in Baodi County, many orphans and widows clamored for relief, demanding more. Shi found that several families were hiding grain and rice and were not truly impoverished. However, they continued to make noise. Shi then publicly said, "If all orphans and widows must receive relief, then should the current Emperor and Empress Dowager also receive relief?" (Incident from the early years of the Guangxu reign). Therefore, I hope that the leaders of the relief efforts will be honest and impartial. As for the secondary personnel, they must be able to endure hardship and be obedient. Although they occupy a secondary position in the overall process, the completion of the relief effort depends entirely on their efforts. They must travel day and night, endure hunger and thirst, walk through slums, and carry supplies from house to house. If they cannot endure hardship, how can they accomplish this? It is said that Zhu Ziqiao personally distributed relief in Shaanxi but had his load of steamed buns completely looted by starving people on the road. His clothes were torn, and his fingers were scratched, which was a common occurrence. Furthermore, the distribution of rations must follow the commander's instructions, otherwise, it will significantly affect the entire operation.</p>
<p>After all this talk, we are still back to the main topic. The disaster relief in North China is, of course, an emergency relief effort. It would be best if a considerable amount of money could be raised within ten days to half a month. However, the matter of public bonds is also something we should prepare for, even if we don't end up using them. Moreover, we must prepare seeds and employment relief for them, and even prepare for winter relief. There are many places where money is needed! As for investigation and distribution, it should be designed early. In my humble opinion, it seems that a general relief office should be established in the capital, and branch offices should be established in North Hebei, East Shandong, South Shanxi, and North Henan. Each branch office should have one director and one deputy director, chosen from officials and gentry in the respective provinces. It is also necessary to seek out people with experience in previous relief efforts and widely recruit them to investigate and distribute relief separately, in order to achieve early success.</p>
<h3>The Russo-Japanese War: Records from This Newspaper Thirty-Eight Years Ago - Old News Newly Copied (3)</h3>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>We recognize that defending the Pacific from now on will be entirely the responsibility of Asians, and we will no longer allow Anglo-American forces to interfere and invade. However, fulfilling the task of defense depends on a strong naval force. Our friendly nation, Japan, has built up its navy through decades of diligent effort and continuous improvement. In the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago, they showed their strength by defeating the outnumbered. In the Great East Asia War, they further demonstrated their invincible power. Currently, the entire defense of the Pacific is solely shouldered by the navy of our friendly nation, and we are deeply ashamed that we have not been able to share the burden. Therefore, how we will emulate the navy of our friendly nation to build a new Chinese navy and participate in the task of defending the Pacific is a goal that all Chinese people should strive to achieve urgently. To increase the Chinese people's naval knowledge and interest, this newspaper will extract and re-copy the records of this newspaper during the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago, from the 21st to the 30th, for a period of ten days. We hope readers will pay attention.</p>
<h3>Examples of Why China Cannot Firmly Adhere to Neutrality (Published in This Newspaper, No. 11082, Guangxu Year 30, Month 1, Day 11, Western Calendar February 26, 1904, Friday)</h3>
<p>When Country A and Country B have started hostilities, the neighboring country neither helps Country A nor helps Country B. This is called adhering to neutrality. International law experts also call it non-enemy status. In the past, European countries such as Switzerland, Belgium, Serbia, and Luxembourg all followed this example. This is because Switzerland is located in a strategic location, bordering France, Germany, Austria, and Italy. The rivers and streams within its borders all originate from the Swiss mountains, making it difficult to defend the borders. Switzerland's adherence to neutrality is crucial to the overall situation, and if it does not adhere to it, it will be difficult to avoid endangering itself. Belgium is located between France and Germany and has historically been a battlefield for various countries. According to the Treaty of London in 1831, various countries ordered it to maintain neutrality permanently in order to avoid war forever. Serbia's adherence to neutrality began with the Treaty of Paris in 1856. Luxembourg's adherence to neutrality began with the Treaty of London in 1867. In short, there are two reasons for adhering to neutrality: one is that it is voluntarily done based on one's own assessment of the situation; the other is that it is imposed by neighboring countries through treaties due to significant relationships with neighboring countries. However, once the intention to maintain neutrality has been declared, one must strictly adhere to the rules of neutrality in order to comply with international law. Otherwise, it will be difficult to avoid being despised by the enemy and losing one's own rights and interests. Now that Russia and Japan have met with weapons and started hostilities, most European countries are adhering to neutrality, and China has also clearly issued an edict stating that both Russia and Japan are friendly countries and should be dealt with in accordance with the principle of neutrality. When facing countries with comparable strength and during fierce battles, it is only natural to remain neutral if one's own military preparedness is not strong enough. However, adhering to this principle is not easy, and there are two main requirements: one is not to abandon the right to wage war; the other is not to show bias. According to Ding's translation of International Law, Chapter 743, a neutral country does not have to renounce its right to wage war in advance. The explanation is: some countries always adhere to neutrality but still do not abandon their right to wage war. Without the right to wage war, there is no way to defend the law and protect oneself; without the ability to protect oneself, one loses the status of an autonomous country. Chapter 748 states: a neutral country, fearing that the warring country will violate its borders, often sets up troops to defend and block, which is called holding troops to observe. The explanation is: deploying troops for defense and blockage should not be regarded as an act of war, but rather as an intention to preserve one's neutrality. A country that cannot protect itself with arms will inevitably be subject to opportunistic encroachment by warring countries. From these two sections, it can be seen that although a neutral country does not participate in the war, it must not abandon its right to wage war. Before the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War, the Chinese government either advocated alliance with Russia or alliance with Japan, and opinions differed, leading to different arguments. After the outbreak of hostilities, although the government declared neutrality and announced it to various countries, its intentions revealed a greater fear of Russia than of Japan. Recently, because Russian warships were anchored in the Shanghai River, the Shanghai Daotai cited international law to force them to leave China's waters within 24 hours. However, the Russian minister, citing the protection of Russian officials and merchants, consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and actually allowed them to anchor in the center of the river. Now that the two countries are at war, warships of either country should not be allowed to enter and anchor in the ports of a neutral country. This is what international law requires. If it is said that officials and merchants fear being caught in the crossfire, then the responsibility for protection lies with China. Why should we immediately allow Russian warships to anchor there? If enemy countries recruit troops within our borders or Chinese people privately provide assistance, all actions related to military intelligence that benefit one country and harm the other, if not detected and acted upon rashly, how can we avoid mutual accusations? Therefore, the policy of neutrality is not easy to implement. If those in charge rely on existing treaties and fail to pay attention to these measures, I fear that disaster is imminent, and the state of neutrality will not last long.</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper Describes the Topography of the Lushun Forts (Published in This Newspaper, No. 11110, Guangxu Year 30, Month 2, Day 9, Western Calendar March 25, 1904, Friday)</h3>
<p>A certain newspaper in Osaka, Japan, said: In any country, all important passes are prohibited from using photography to map out the terrain, so the location of the forts is unknown to foreigners. However, the Russian military laws are not strict, and the soldiers are lax, so the plans of the Lushun forts were obtained by Japanese soldiers. Among them, several were clearly built by Chinese people, and later renovated by the Russian army, making them look brand new. In total, there are about 30 forts in various places. The one on the Tiger Tail Peninsula is called Wei Yuan. In addition, there are six forts, such as Xinjitou, Gaoshan, Manziying, Mantoushan, and Chengtoushan. The Wei Yuan fort on Tiger Tail faces the sea and extends southwest to Laotieshan, continuously. The Laotieshan fort is located at the tip of Lushun, at the foot of Laotieshan. Huangjinshan Fort is the largest of all the forts, located south of the old city and facing Tiger Tail. There is a protruding corner at the entrance of Lushun, with two forts to the southeast and due west. The forts due west are collectively called Huangjinshan Fort, just as the forts in Laotieshan are collectively called Laotieshan Fort. To the east of Huangjinshan is Muzhu Reef Fort, with two built-up camps. To the northeast of Muzhu Reef is Qizizuijiao Fort. All of the above forts face the sea. In addition, behind Xinjie, there are also forts protecting Yizishan, Songshushan, and Erlongshan, to prevent the enemy from attacking from behind. Yizishan has two forts, Anzishan and Wangtai Fort, to control the east. Songshushan Fort is east of Yizishan, and further east is Erlongshan Fort, and further east are Jiguan, Taboshan, and Pantao Mountain forts. These are all used to prevent the enemy from attacking from the east of Xinjie. To the west of Xinjie are Yangjiatun and Taijiatun, located near Jiuwan, where new forts are also being built, but not completed. In total, there are 26 forts that have been completed or renovated, and there are also many that have been surveyed and are under construction. When the Japanese army attacked Lushun for the fourth time, Wei Yuan and Manziying forts were destroyed by artillery fire. This is because the Tiger Tail Peninsula directly faces the ocean, causing the forts to collapse and the gun emplacements to tilt.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The valiant sacrifice of Japanese Admiral Yamamoto has deeply saddened all industrial warriors in Japan. They are determined to work harder in their respective positions to continue to serve the country, to comfort the soul of the late Admiral in heaven. At the same time, the belief in certain victory of the 100 million Japanese people is becoming stronger and stronger. Especially the workers directly engaged in the production of munitions are even more grief-stricken, and they believe that the only way to comfort the spirit of the late Admiral is to strive to increase production. The Japan Industrial Patriotic Association, in view of this, plans to hold various events to enhance the fighting spirit of industrial warriors. It has decided that on the day of the late Admiral's state funeral, all workers will donate one day's income to the Ministry of the Navy. The specific measures will be notified to national industrial patriotic organizations soon to enable implementation. According to the president of the Obata Industrial Patriotic Association, Kobata, Admiral Yamamoto bravely fought on the front line in the South and unfortunately died valiantly, which is enough to prove the intensity of this war. At the same time, we should make a new combat resolution to comfort the spirit of the late Admiral. Therefore, we should further enhance the fighting spirit and strive to defeat the Anglo-Americans. The Industrial Patriotic Association plans to appeal to all munitions workers across the country to strive to increase the production of aircraft in order to improve the spirit of war. The specific plan is being studied. At present, the national industrial warriors have a higher sense of hatred and unity.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Capital of Argentina, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to a report from New York, former Tokyo correspondent of the Associated Press, Bob, said regarding the death of Japanese Admiral Yamamoto: The Japanese Allied News Agency broadcast that Admiral Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet, had died in battle. With the death of Admiral Yamamoto, the Japanese Navy has lost its most capable leader. Admiral Yamamoto was thoughtful, resolute, and upright. During this war, he resolutely adopted new tactics, so he was indeed an outstanding talent in the Japanese Navy. The plan to attack Pearl Harbor was probably drafted by Admiral Yamamoto. Admiral Yamamoto was the first person in Japan to recognize the need for the army and the navy to cooperate as a whole. Perhaps he was also the first person in the world to recognize this need. He made the army and navy fully exert the effect of cooperation. By attacking Pearl Harbor and the Battle of Malaya, he enabled the Japanese Navy to control the vast region from the Western Pacific to the Indian Ocean. Although we do not know what impact the death of Admiral Yamamoto will have on the Japanese Navy, the organization of the Japanese Navy's leadership is like a machine, which no other country's combat unit can match. Although Admiral Yamamoto was extremely great, he did not have much impact on the entire Japanese Navy.</p>

Later, in order to thoroughly destroy the Chongqing army in that area, the Japanese army began attacking the Chongqing 10th Army Group in the western area of Gongan. The Japanese army overcame mountain dangers, implemented mobile warfare, and received close cooperation from the air force, so the progress was extremely rapid.

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>In Deep Mourning for Admiral Yamamoto</h3>
<p>Former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet, Admiral Yamamoto, died valiantly in battle on the front line. The sad news shocked all of Asia. Not only the people of Japan, out of admiration for Admiral Yamamoto's achievements during his lifetime, expressed their heartfelt mourning. Even the Chinese people, because Admiral Yamamoto was defending the Pacific and liberating the freedom of Asians, also expressed their heartfelt mourning because they had lost a leader.</p>
<p>The ancients said: "People are bound to die, and death can be heavier than Mount Tai or lighter than a feather." Today, Admiral Yamamoto sacrificed his life to fulfill his loyalty to the country and defend East Asia, which can be said to be a death heavier than Mount Tai. Soldiers originally have the spirit of "regarding death as returning home," and sacrificing their lives on the battlefield is considered glory. Therefore, for the Admiral himself, he has "completed his achievements and sacrificed his life, and has no regrets looking up or down."</p>
<p>There are indeed many outstanding generals in the Japanese Navy who have created glorious achievements in the past and future naval history. However, we feel even more that the Japanese Navy "has been continuously tempered for decades and has cultivated a united spirit, becoming an entire naval fortress." This is the characteristic of the Japanese Navy. Therefore, although Admiral Yamamoto's death has deprived the Japanese Navy of an outstanding general, it will not diminish the overall naval power. On the contrary, it will be enough to arouse a higher sense of "common hatred of the enemy" among all the officers and soldiers of the Japanese Navy, and accelerate the destruction of the enemy in order to continue Admiral Yamamoto's legacy. We respectfully express our sympathy and mourn the death of Admiral Yamamoto; and we expect the victory of the Japanese Navy with great enthusiasm.</p>

<h3>Ambassador Tani Discusses the Direction of New Policy Towards China</h3>
<p>The Japanese Asahi Shimbun published on May 18th the main points of Ambassador Tani's first meeting with Chinese and Japanese journalists in Nanjing on the 17th, which are clearer and more concrete than those previously published by various newspapers. Therefore, we have translated them as follows. —Editor's Note</p>
<p>Ambassador Tani held his first meeting with a group of Chinese and Japanese journalists at the embassy on the 17th and gave a speech, hinting at the specific progress sequence of the new policy towards China in the future as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Remaining issues of the new policy towards China in the future include the return of the Shanghai International Settlement, the abolition of extraterritorial rights, the adjustment of national policy companies, the transfer of new enemy properties, and foreign trade institutions. In terms of sequence, it is planned to start with the abolition of taxation rights in extraterritorial rights first.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the abolition of taxation rights, the second special committee will be held on the 17th, and a specific decision will be made. Formal negotiations with China will begin next month.</p>
<p>(3) The return of the Shanghai International Settlement will proceed in parallel with the abolition of extraterritorial rights, and preparations will be made under the policy of realizing them one by one after the Chinese side has completed preparations.</p>
<p>(4) The adjustment of national policy companies is the principle policy already decided by the Greater East Asia Ministry. President Takashima, after taking office last time, thoroughly investigated the local situation and is currently returning to Beijing to select a specific adjustment plan. After Takashima and his colleagues take office, they will first start adjusting the two companies related to people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>(5) The second transfer of new enemy properties, foreign trade institutions, etc., will be implemented quickly from the perspective of enhancing production and promoting trade, fully considering the wishes of the Chinese side under the basic policy of Sino-Japanese cooperation.</p>

Ambassador Tani plans to visit the major embassy offices in Shanghai, Beijing, and Zhangjiakou this month to thoroughly inspect the local situation. Ambassador Tani will see lively developments after returning to Nanjing from his inspection in mid-June or July. (Xiang: Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun, May 18)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops on Attu Island Have Strong Morale, Counterattack American Forces Inflicting Heavy Casualties, Landing Troops on East Coast Completely Annihilated, American Forces on North Coast Reinforcing and Attempting to Advance South</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - After the American forces landed on Attu Island on the 12th of this month, the morale of the Japanese garrison on the island has been increasing, and they are currently conducting fierce counterattacks day and night. After the Americans landing on the east coast were annihilated, there are no enemy shadows in that area. However, the American forces are now gradually reinforcing the island. The Japanese garrison is continuing its fierce counterattacks in the eastern area positions. The American side's announcements regarding the battle situation on Attu Island are often based on Japanese announcements. According to what the American Secretary of the Navy Knox said when meeting with reporters on the 18th, the American forces landing at Holtz Bay (North Coast) and Massacre Bay (South Coast) are now attempting to converge, but they have suffered heavy casualties due to the fierce counterattacks by the Japanese forces. Enemy sources also widely circulated that the Japanese garrison's courageous counterattacks have resulted in heavier casualties for the American troops in this landing operation than on the South Pacific front.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Major General Tanihagi, head of the Imperial Headquarters' press department, made the following statement today regarding the battle situation on Attu Island: (1) The main force of the enemy seems to have landed on the south coast of Attu Island, and its strength is gradually increasing. Since May 16th, tanks and heavy military supplies have been transported ashore. (2) The enemy forces landing on the north coast are increasing their strength daily and are currently advancing south, attempting to contact the forces landing on the south coast. (3) On the east coast, due to our army's brave counterattack on May 22nd, the enemy landing troops were annihilated, so there are no enemy shadows in that area. (4) The enemy's strength is about one division, guarded by a powerful fleet and air force, and equipped with tanks and heavy artillery. Our garrison withdrew its forward troops on the night of May 16th and defended the positions in the eastern area of the island, resisting the superior enemy with a small number of troops under fierce enemy artillery fire, counterattacking them and inflicting great damage.

<h3>Possible Resumption of Diplomatic Relations between Soviet Union and Poland, New Polish Regime Reported to Appear, Sikorski's Political Enemies Now Emerging, Moscow May Fully Exploit Polish Communist Party</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to London news received by Swedish newspapers, the belief that a new Polish puppet government will be established is becoming more widespread, as Ms. Wassilewska, a political enemy of the Sikorski government, is gradually emerging. Minister of Information Kott, under the government led by Sikorski, recently criticized Ms. Wassilewska's personality, saying that she is a Polish Communist and has never engaged in any important activities in Poland. She only became active on the political stage because she married the journalist Konatczyk, who succeeded Molotov as Soviet Foreign Minister. Konatczyk is currently the Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union and has assisted her in establishing the purely communist "Polish Patriotic Alliance." Ms. Wassilewska is now an honorary colonel in the newly established Polish Second Army Corps. The leader of this corps, Colonel Berling, was awarded military rank when he stayed in Moscow to negotiate with the Communist Party. Berling is also a well-known Polish Communist, and his opposition to the London Polish government is no less than that of Ms. Wassilewska. According to the Svenska Dagbladet, since the publication of Kott's remarks, it has attracted the attention of people in London, who believe that if the Polish government does not reach an understanding with the Soviet Union, Moscow will fully exploit the Polish Communist Party. Sikorski is deeply afraid that the Soviet Union will establish a new Polish regime with Ms. Wassilewska as its leader, and is now exhausting his abilities to resolve the Soviet-Polish dispute satisfactorily.</p>
<h3>Both Britain and the United States Await Stalin's Reply</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) - President Roosevelt said yesterday at a reception for newspaper reporters at the White House that the content of his letter to Stalin was not even known to Ambassador Davies, who delivered the letter. Only Roosevelt's personal secretary, Mr. O'Leary, knew the content of the letter. After reading the letter, Stalin seemed to be discussing its contents with Davies. Davies will return home immediately to report as soon as the discussion is over. At the same time, according to another report from Washington, Roosevelt and Churchill are continuing to meet to discuss the East Asian war situation. Observers generally believe that this shows that discussions on the European war cannot continue until the Soviet Union's attitude towards the smaller countries of Europe is clarified. According to reports, since Churchill gave a speech in the U.S. Congress, discussions on the East Asian issue have progressed more smoothly, as Churchill has agreed to the U.S. policy to strengthen the complex relationship between Britain and the United States. There are also rumors in Washington that Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov, who recently returned home, may be replaced by someone else.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 21st (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reported that Soviet newspapers have remained completely silent regarding Churchill's speech in the U.S. Congress and Roosevelt's personal representative Davies' visit to Moscow. Political figures in Berlin believe this is a noteworthy sign, and they point out that Stalin is apparently attempting to force Churchill and Roosevelt to make even greater concessions to the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3>Fierce Artillery Battles Occur in the Donets River Region</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to front-line news, there has been no significant fighting between the German and Soviet armies for several weeks on the 510-mile Donets River front. Fierce artillery battles have suddenly broken out. According to a report in the Soviet newspaper Izvestia on the 21st, the two armies have launched preliminary battles to seize the Donets bridgehead in Izyum, Krasny Liman, Lisichansk, and other places. Air battles are also extremely fierce. According to German authorities, all Soviet offensives have been repulsed, especially with heavy losses of tanks. In addition, fierce artillery battles have also broken out in the Novorossiysk area. Also, large-scale naval and air battles were launched on the 21st in the waters along the Black Sea coast, but the Soviet army did not launch an offensive on land, so the two armies remain in a state of confrontation. According to the German News Agency, the Soviet army is continuing to concentrate its forces towards the east of Orel and the west of Kursk, attempting to move south in one fell swoop to recapture Kharkov, but the Soviet Red Star newspaper commented in an editorial on the 21st that the Soviet army should still adopt a defensive war in the summer campaign. If the Soviet army can stop the German offensive this summer, then victory will surely belong to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The German Führer Headquarters released a battle situation communique on the 21st as follows: (1) There was small-scale fighting on the Eastern Front, with no significant changes. (2) The German Navy sank two Soviet transport ships in the waters off the Caucasus coast. (3) The German Air Force launched a fierce attack on the port of Bejaia on the Algerian coast.

<h3>Air Supremacy and the Maritime War Situation (1)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Kiichiro Sato from Kaizo, May Issue</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>At the start of World War I, the mission of aircraft was solely to scout enemy positions. When the German army attempted to break through the Liege fortress in Belgium to invade French territory at the beginning of the war, it was French aircraft that first discovered this attempt.</p>
<p>"Approximately ten German corps have invaded Belgium and are advancing rapidly towards Liege."</p>
<p>For the aircraft of that time, this was an extremely valuable report, but French Commander-in-Chief Joffre absolutely did not believe it. This was because he not only advanced directly without regard for the circumstances, underestimating the strength of the German army, but also only trusted the reconnaissance of 100,000 cavalrymen. However, at that time, this cavalry unit had not yet detected the German invasion of Belgium. This was the main reason for the French army's retreat at the beginning of the war.</p>
<p>By late August (1914), British aircraft discovered the German Second Army advancing from Brussels towards Grammont. In early September, they also scouted the movements of the German First Army in the Battle of the Marne, providing various important intelligence to headquarters. Learning from the previous fall of Liege, Joffre now believed the aircraft reports and used them as the basis for directing operations.</p>
<p>Conversely, an example of a situation where believing in aerial reconnaissance led to a favorable war situation was the Mortain counterattack, which occurred immediately after the Battle of the Marne. The German army facing the French Second Army led by Castelnau had moved its main force to the main battle front, leaving only a small number of troops. Therefore, Second Army aircraft scouted and discovered that the enemy had retreated 40 to 50 kilometers. Based on this report, Castelnau issued an advance order thirty minutes later, achieving victory at Mortain.</p>
<p>Although the equipment of aircraft at that time was incomplete and piloting techniques were still immature, they had already made undeniable contributions. However, precisely because aircraft were mainly focused on reconnaissance, combat and bombing did not appear as tactics in the early stages of the war. Later, when the battle lines became fixed and the two armies faced each other in trenches, aircraft reconnaissance became unnecessary, with artillery observation being the main task at most.</p>
<p>The emergence of bomber squadrons occurred in May 1915. As a flagship, four French battalions were created with the mission of bombing German military supply factories. Eighteen Voisin aircraft raided the Rottweil harbor factory, shocking the whole of Germany. In this initial bombing, the French army only lost one aircraft due to engine trouble.</p>
<p>Continuing to bomb Karlsruhe also yielded unexpected gains. The four bomber battalions were placed under the command of a single officer, and plans were made to operate exclusively outside French territory. Just as the French Air Force was about to reach the pinnacle of satisfaction, a sudden reversal occurred, and they were forced to fall into the depths of despair. German fighter planes suddenly appeared. When encountering fighter planes that were very fast, maneuverable, and nimble, French aircraft would immediately be hit by machine gun fire. When flying alone, falling behind in a squadron, or traversing air routes, the French army could not fly back. Long-distance flights seemed to require a terrible price for the French Air Force. In August of that year, nine bombers were shot down instantly during the bombing of Saarbrücken.</p>
<p>The bombers of the French Air Force, which had strutted about in the air, gradually declined in this way. Then, German fighter planes took their place, proudly waving their wings and reigning supreme over the skies. This was the first time in the history of world warfare that air supremacy had been seized.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the French Air Force immediately established fighter squadrons to counter this. However, the Battle of Verdun, which soon began, further cemented the German Air Force's air supremacy. The German army concentrated superior air power on the Verdun front. Upon seeing French aircraft, they dispatched fighter planes to drive them away from the battle lines, and mobilized artillery at the airfields to prevent them from landing.</p>
<p>Although the German Air Force was proud of its control of the skies over Verdun, the newly equipped French independent pursuit squadron regained air supremacy in the subsequent Battle of Saint-Mihiel. In a section of the German combat report on the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, there is the following statement:</p>
<p>"During the initial weeks of the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, we keenly felt the inferiority of our combat strength in aerial warfare. Enemy aircraft carried out long-range reconnaissance with complete freedom, and relying on their observation and scouting, enemy artillery completely overwhelmed our artillery."</p>
<p>The acquisition of air supremacy not only determined the superiority or inferiority of aircraft against aircraft, but also gave it a significant impact on the overall military operation. This has recently been mutually recognized by both armies. It is generally accepted that maintaining a strong fighter squadron is an indispensable element in combat. At the same time, the duties of a fighter squadron are clearly twofold: one is the offensive task of hindering the enemy's air squadron operations, and the other is the defensive task of ensuring the freedom of our reconnaissance aircraft.</p>
<p>However, by 1917, with the Battle of Arras as a turning point, air supremacy returned to the German army. The German army exerted great effort to improve the quality and increase the quantity of aircraft. It can be said that the actions of the French Air Force were almost completely suppressed. Witnessing barrage balloons being burned down by German fighter planes day after day, the French Air Force had no other option but to fly in formation at close range and at high and low altitudes, setting up safe zones in which they had no confidence, and struggling to operate their aircraft within them.</p>
<p>Not only that, but an event that can be described as a bolt from the blue for the weakening French Air Force was the German army's use of bombers at night. Previously, bombers were two-seater aircraft with very small carrying capacity, and night operations were limited to nights with a bright moon. Most terrifying was the summer of 1917, when new German bombers, with a carrying capacity of up to 600 kilograms, carried out air raids in the dark night with composure. In the dark of night, French airfields, barracks, train stations, factories, etc., were bombed everywhere, and the damage suffered increased day by day.</p>
<p>As a result, the French army was forced to disperse airfields, rebuild and re-equip bomber squadrons, and only gradually regained air supremacy by 1918.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>During World War I, air supremacy was controlled by the German army in a certain area for a certain period of time, and by the Allied forces in a certain area for a certain period of time. The ground situation also continued to advance and retreat accordingly, but air supremacy did not dominate the entire war situation as it does now. Needless to say, this was because the power of aircraft could not be compared with that of today, and the number was small. Moreover, even in terms of tactics, it had not yet gone beyond the initial stages.</p>
<p>Later, during the Spanish Civil War, aircraft from Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, France, Britain, and other countries also fought each other. However, this war was just like a field test of aircraft from various countries. Without the awareness of wrestling in a national gymnasium, one would not truly participate in the air force. This is of course true.</p>
<p>Then, this great war broke out.</p>
<p>Regarding the air war results of the German army's launch of blitzkriegs in Poland at the beginning of this great war, followed by rushing into Belgium and the Netherlands, sweeping through France, occupying Norway, and attacking the Balkan Peninsula, it is not necessary to describe them in detail here. However, in order, it is necessary to briefly glance at the activities of the German Air Force in these operations, and to mention the significance of air supremacy for naval operations, which is the theme of this article.</p>
<p>On September 1 and 2, 1939, the German Air Force rapidly descended, concentrating bombings on 35 to 30 Polish airfields, destroying 45% of all Polish air power (calculated by France as 20%). In short, air supremacy had already been achieved on the first day of the war.</p>
<p>When advancing into the Netherlands, Belgium, and northern France, the same tactics as in the Polish campaign were adopted. Before the ground forces, bombers were quickly dispatched, inflicting a fatal blow on the British and French air forces in just three days, seizing air supremacy on the western front. Now, let's combine the operational actions of the German Air Force:</p>
<p>1.  Achieve air supremacy by aerial combat or attacking air bases; next, occupy airfields and other strategic locations by airlifting troops and parachute units. At the same time, bomb aircraft factories and air defense facilities.</p>
<p>2.  Bomb railways, automobiles, and other ground transportation facilities, as well as ships and port facilities, to hinder the movement and concentration of the British and French armies.</p>
<p>3.  Cover mechanized units and closely coordinate with ground forces, bombing fortresses, armored vehicle units, ground troop deployments, headquarters locations, etc. The range is extremely wide, and when heavy artillery cannot attack, the power of bombers is increasingly demonstrated.</p>
<p>4.  Take all possible measures to protect friendly troop assembly areas and headquarters from Allied bombing.</p>
<p>5.  Attempt to shake the morale of the enemy's population by long-range bombing of industrial centers and densely populated areas.</p>
<p>On May 10, the first day of the offensive (1940), 100 airfields were bombed in one day. Up to June 5, when the offensive against Paris began, 2,100 enemy aircraft had been shot down or destroyed at airfields, and 1,250 in aerial combat. At this time, German aircraft generally attacked each airfield with 15 to 18 aircraft, mainly dropping 50-kilogram bombs.</p>
<p>In the face of such brilliant activity by the German Air Force, what did the British and French air forces do? Although the British and French air forces had to take the following actions, none of them were done very satisfactorily.</p>
<p>1.  Maintain air force operational capability;</p>
<p>2.  Connect with friendly ground forces on the front lines;</p>
<p>3.  Cooperate with ground air defense formations;</p>
<p>4.  Hinder enemy railway and road traffic;</p>
<p>5.  Bomb enemy munitions industrial areas and military facilities.</p>
<p>Moreover, the organizational strength of the entire army had shortcomings, and the comprehensive agility of action was lost. Only a part of the troops implemented one or two of the above-mentioned tasks.</p>
<p>On the first day of the war, the British and French soldiers, still asleep, lost 1,000 elite aircraft by evening, and morale was completely demoralized. This was one of the reasons for the failure on the western front; for the German army, it proved the success of the blitzkrieg. However, the British Air Force did not want to attack the German parachute units, but was busy bombing transportation facilities that were directly unrelated to the war situation. On the 12th, only 50 transport planes at the Malle airport and the airborne troops at an airport 12 kilometers north of Ypres were attacked. On the one hand, the French Air Force had already lost hope of rising on the first day, and the remaining scattered and incomplete old-fashioned bombers were attacked by the German Air Force. 300 aircraft were shot down or destroyed on the ground, and 70 in aerial combat. How can seizing air supremacy at the beginning of the war dominate the entire war situation? This is an excellent example.</p>

<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Welcome Ambassador Tani</h3>
<p>Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani Masayuki, came to Shanghai soon after taking office. Yesterday, Minister Tajiri hosted a meeting for the city's elite to meet Ambassador Tani. While welcoming him, we sincerely offer three suggestions as a gesture of respect from the Chinese people to Ambassador Tani.</p>
<p>(1) Ambassador Tani was the Foreign Minister when Japan began implementing its new policy towards China and undoubtedly devoted much effort to the decision-making and implementation of the new policy. Now, as an envoy to China, he will undoubtedly make the greatest effort to promote cooperation between the two countries in the future. This is something to celebrate. However, we also believe that the diplomatic direction of the new era must take the voices of the residing people as the basis for its measures. Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, the people in the peace zone have remained silent for many years until the Japanese changed their policy towards China, and the people gradually revealed their innermost voices. We hope that Ambassador Tani will listen to these voices as much as possible, which is also the best opportunity to approach the Chinese people.</p>
<p>(2) At present, the relationship between China and Japan, especially between the people of China and Japan, has significantly improved. However, we cannot ignore the obstacles that still impede further improvement, especially the "minor details" that are easily overlooked. It is often heard from many Chinese and Japanese people: "The major policy has already changed, and minor details are irrelevant." However, we argue the opposite: "Major policies" and "minor obstacles" must be adjusted in parallel. "A small oversight can lead to a major error." This is the most unfortunate thing, and we hope Ambassador Tani will pay attention to this point.</p>
<p>(3) The various provinces in North China are currently suffering from severe famine and are in urgent need of relief. We have repeatedly pointed out that in the process of providing urgent relief, there are many areas where the Japanese authorities in China need to provide full convenience and assistance. We hope that Ambassador Tani will give extra sympathy and, in addition to requesting the local Japanese authorities to provide convenience in relief work, also encourage Japanese residents in China to generously donate so that the millions of disaster victims in North China will deeply appreciate the kindness of Ambassador Tani and the Japanese residents in China.</p>

<p>Economic Circles Welcome</p>
<h3>Change of Jurisdiction of the General Business Association to the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>Shanghai's economic circles have expressed great welcome to the change of jurisdiction of the General Business Association to the Executive Yuan, believing that in the past, not only was the action of the General Business Association subject to the command and supervision of the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Food, and other agencies, but the new trade associations were also directly organized by the two ministries. Because of this complicated guiding and supervising agency, the General Business Association became an intermediate agency. Since the establishment of the United Association and the Trade Association, it is urgent to adjust and clarify the supervision system so as to complete the mission of the General Business Association. The directors and supervisors of the General Business Association, in view of this situation, also submitted a request to the National Government to improve this point. The opinions of the General Business Association can represent the opinions of the entire financial community in Shanghai, so the National Government approved its request and implemented the adjustment, changing the jurisdiction of the General Business Association to the Executive Yuan. The economic circles of this city unanimously support this. Since the General Business Association is under the control of the Executive Yuan, it is expected that its directors and supervisors will also be re-elected and the internal organization will be adjusted at an appropriate time.</p>
<p>It is believed that the future autonomous organizational work of the General Business Association will adapt to reality. If the organizational policy is inconsistent with reality, it will be detrimental to the promotion of the new control work. In principle, there is an absolute need for reform, but it cannot be rushed and must be done gradually. In short, this change of jurisdiction to the Executive Yuan has removed the obstacles to the organizational work of the General Business Association and will surely have the possibility of rapid development.

<h3>Banking Industry's Various Banks and Firms Move Idle Capital to Revive the Countryside</h3>
<p>The various banks and firms in the banking industry, in view of the fact that since the establishment of the National General Business Association, the transportation of goods in various places, except for the provision that major goods must be transported with import and export certificates, all un-controlled goods can be transported freely, in order to promote the active exchange of funds between Shanghai and the interior, are carrying out the following matters:</p>
<p>Adjust Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Adjust the domestic exchange rate to make it simple and convenient, and try to do as much as possible to directly facilitate the allocation of funds in various places. The purpose of reducing the exchange rate is to reduce the remittance burden on the people and commercial institutions, and at the same time seek the healthy development of the economy of Central China. The circulation of Central Reserve Notes has penetrated into various places, and the consolidation of the financial foundation is to guide the idle capital in Shanghai into the interior to revive the rural economy, so various conveniences are provided for domestic exchange. Recently, as the spring cocoon of Jiangsu and Zhejiang has been put on the market, a large amount of funds has flowed from Shanghai to the interior for the purpose of purchasing spring cocoons. At the same time, the arrival of wheat in the interior is not far away, and the inflow of funds will inevitably increase. It is also heard that a large amount of exchange must explain the proper purpose, such as purchasing agricultural products, etc., the purpose is to prevent the congestion of funds in the interior.</p>
<p>Deposits Increase Sharply</p>
<p>Since the Banking Association issued a notice to tighten interbank lending and advised member banks and firms to maintain their strength to ensure safety, all banks and firms have strengthened their own preparations for sound operation, and are extremely cautious in all lending, whether collateral, credit, or overdraft. Therefore, the deposits of member banks and firms of the Banking Association have become increasingly abundant. Taking March of this year as an example, it was 805,743,172.53 yuan, 545,833,891.46 yuan in the same month of the 31st year, 190,875,076.05 yuan in the same month of the 30th year, 76,883,911.90 yuan in the same month of the 29th year, 86,894,324.42 yuan in the same month of the 28th year, 59,318,462.56 yuan in the same month of the 27th year, 96,192,401.13 yuan in the same month of the 26th year, and 103,099,694.70 yuan in the same month of the 25th year. (Note: Before June of the 31st year, the old currency was used as the standard, and the Central Reserve Notes was used as the standard after that.)</p>
<h3>Central China Electric Company's Seventh Shareholders Meeting</h3>
<p>The Central China Electric Communication Company held its seventh shareholders meeting at 2:00 PM on the 21st. All shareholders and related officials from China and Japan attended the meeting on time. The following three proposals were raised during the meeting: (1) Business report and final accounts, (2) Distribution of dividends, (3) The term of office of the two supervisors has expired, regarding the issue of their re-election. The first proposal was unanimously approved by the entire session. The second proposal decided on a dividend of six percent. Supervisors Wang Jianmin and Yuya Kyoichi were re-elected. (Mainland News, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Cotton, Hemp, Wool, and Leather Listed as Controlled Products</h3>
<p>The Materials Control Review Committee of the General Business Association, at its meeting the day before yesterday (20th), in view of the fact that the control organizations for eleven materials, including wheat, flour, miscellaneous grains, oils and fats, raw cotton yarn, cloth, livestock, soap, candles, matches, sugar, and tobacco, have been organized and completed, but cotton, hemp, wool, and leather have not been included in the scope of controlled products in the past, it was resolved to request the General Business Association to add them to the list. At the same time, the General Business Association will promptly organize the control organizations for the above four materials.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Professional Committee Actively Organizes Internal Agencies Organization of Oil and Grain Professional Committee Still Under Consideration</h3>
<p>The Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the General Business Association, after its establishment the other day, it is learned that the committee is currently actively setting up various internal organizations. The personnel of its organizations are generally Chinese and Japanese flour and wheat merchants, mainly Chinese merchants and supplemented by Japanese merchants. It is heard that the organizational rules and regulations of the committee are about to be drafted.</p>
<p>Chinese Flour Mills Prepare to Resume Operations</p>
<p>It is also learned that Chinese flour mills have been suspended for a long time. After entering the new economic stage this time, various flour mills also intend to prepare to start flour production because Chinese flour and wheat merchants can participate in the work of collecting wheat. It is learned that currently, the Bifeng Flour Mill is planning to resume operations.</p>
<p>Oil and Grain Professional Committee Still Under Consideration</p>
<p>In addition, the news that the General Business Association intends to set up an Oil and Grain Committee and that the organizational system has been basically decided was reported in various newspapers the day before yesterday. According to the association, the General Business Association is still considering whether the oil and grain industry needs to organize a professional committee. Because the establishment of a professional committee must be approved by the General Business Association, the above news was not a misunderstanding.</p>
<h3>Trend of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the decline of Chinese stocks became increasingly strong. In a wave of selling, the prices of various stocks fell sharply across the board. The department store industry was still the most volatile, and Wing On Company has fallen into the Guan Nei area. There were not many transactions for Sincere and Guohuo, and the price also fell slightly. In the textile industry, Wing On Textile also entered the Guan Nei area, and Mayer Silk Factory was slightly lower. The supply of underwear exceeded demand and also saw a decline. Greater China Match rose and fell back, and the buying trend of the past two days dissipated. Nanyang and Huacheng Silk Companies both quoted lower prices. There were few transactions for Commercial Press, Chung Hwa, and World Book Company, and there were also few sellers, so the decline was still minor. Zhabei Water and Electricity and Huashang Electric also saw a decline. Jiu'an Industrial was flat and tired. Xinyi Real Estate had a relatively large squeeze. China United Film had supply but no demand. Small-denomination textile stocks were also in decline. Only the Jinfu Shirt Machine Factory and Tongyi Trust, two new stocks that had just entered the market, had transaction prices even higher than the previous day, and transactions were also brisk. As for Zhongfang and Xinhuo stocks, it is heard that they will soon be officially opened for trading in the Chinese stock market.</p>
<h3>Dynamics of Various Trade Associations</h3>
<p>Department Store Industry: The United Association of the Department Store Industry is now ready and will hold its inaugural meeting on the 28th of this month on the seventh floor of the Xindu Hotel.</p>
<p>Tobacco Industry: The United Tobacco Industry Association is scheduled to convene a general meeting of all members at the Atlantic Restaurant at 3:00 PM on the 31st of this month to hold its inaugural meeting, and has sent letters to the trade associations in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions to send one to five representatives to Shanghai to attend and participate in the election of directors. According to reporters' inquiries with the General Business Association, after the organizational structure of each of these united trade associations is completed, they will carry out the task of controlling the purchase and distribution of materials for the same industry.</p>
<p>Chemical Industry: The United Chemical Industry Association, according to the Interim Regulations on the Organization of Industrial and Commercial Trade Unions, has already drafted its organization and is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at the Wuzhou Pharmacy on Sima Road at 2:00 PM on the 25th. The affiliated trade associations in the peace zone will send one to five representatives to Shanghai to attend. There are six types of unit trade associations in the United Association, and their organizational work is generally ready: (1) Chemical Industry Raw Material Factory Trade Association, (2) Chemical Industry Raw Material Company Trade Association, (3) Chemical Industry Product Trade Association, (4) Pharmaceutical Factory Trade Association, (5) New Drug Trade Association, (6) Pigment Trade Association.</p>
<p>Rubber Industry: The Shanghai Special City Rubber Goods Company Trade Association held its first preparatory meeting yesterday, convened by convener Wang Jingdong, and decided to hold its inaugural meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on May 29th. It is heard that the association includes companies engaged in the business of rubber goods, shoes, tires, and parts, and all should apply for membership before May 26th.</p>
<p>Silk and Satin Industry: The Municipal Silk and Satin Company Trade Association has also been prepared and is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the 24th to discuss the articles of association and elect directors and supervisors.</p>
<h3>Supply of Soap Raw Materials Continues</h3>
<p>The price of soap in this city was previously manipulated, and the price was much higher than the limit price, which caused great inconvenience to the citizens. Later, after the supply of raw materials for making soap, such as coconut oil, continued, various soap factories resumed production and manufactured a large number of products, resulting in a halt to the rising price of soap on the market. Recently, after the implementation of the new economic policy, the source of raw materials for making soap has become more convenient, and the output of soap can also become more abundant, resulting in a continuous decline in the retail price of soap in recent days.</p>
<h3>The Life of a Bank Clerk</h3>
<p>— Ji Xiaoshang</p>
<p>In the past, the profession of a bank clerk was regarded as a superior position with a "silver rice bowl" that many people envied and many soon-to-graduate young students hoped to obtain; however, today, it is absolutely impossible for a bank clerk to support a family with all his salary and allowances. The comparison between the past and the present makes people sigh.</p>
<p>I work in a commercial bank with a long history and a large scale, with a monthly salary of sixty yuan (most of the clerks in the entire bank have a monthly salary of sixty yuan). Together with allowances, the total monthly income is 900 yuan, and the bank provides free lunch. There are three people in my family, and we don't hire a nanny. The minimum monthly expenditure is 1,500 yuan, and the situation of income not meeting expenditure is obvious.</p>
<p>This expenditure of 1,500 yuan includes rent, water and electricity bills, transportation expenses, food, coal balls, cooking oil, sugar, salt, soap, toilet paper, etc., as well as "human relations" during weddings and funerals among relatives and friends. We have no entertainment expenses, we don't buy clothes, shoes, or socks, and we don't buy books or magazines, but we only buy one Shen Bao newspaper to read every day. Occasionally, when we have minor illnesses such as colds, coughs, headaches, or fever, we don't seek medical treatment, but at most buy a few aspirins or quinine pills to take. We feel that we have saved as much as possible, but the fact that income cannot meet expenditure is undeniable and unavoidable.</p>
<p>In addition to working in the bank, I do not hold other positions, so I have no other income. My leisure activities are: reading, writing articles, washing clothes, visiting relatives and friends, and walking on the road, that's all, and I don't waste any money. I get my hair cut twice a month, and I don't think I can save any more!</p>
<p>Some colleagues also do business or trade stocks to earn some "extra money"; however, I don't have this kind of "extra money" to earn. The reasons are: first, I don't have any capital, and my family's financial situation is very poor; second, I don't want to do speculative hoarding.</p>
<p>For daily necessities, such as soap, toilet paper, oil, sugar, salt, coal balls, etc., I only buy them when I need them, and I never buy a month's or several months' worth in advance. On the one hand, buying in advance will inevitably promote the trend of hoarding. On the other hand, I hope that prices will gradually fall. Unexpectedly, prices not only did not fall due to the authorities' announcement of strict suppression, but instead continued to rise. Seeing that some colleagues bought several months' worth of daily necessities and saved a lot of money, I felt regret in my heart and was even blamed by my old mother when I returned home, saying: "I told you to buy a little more, but you didn't listen. Look, it's gone up again now!" I think: It's really not easy to be a person, and it's even harder to be a law-abiding and dutiful person!</p>
