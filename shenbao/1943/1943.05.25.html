<p>社評</p>
<h3>對於友邦現地當局一個請求</h3>
<p>昨天報載，本市發生利用日憲兵隊名義，索詐金錢案件，幸事前被憲兵當局偵知，人犯當塲捕獲，移送軍法會議審理。日憲兵隊並爲防止類此事件，將來如再有利用軍部或憲兵隊名義，爲非作歹者，不論國籍，槪予嚴重處罰。查該案人犯僅三人，一魚商，一店員，一稅政局職員，而索詐目標竟達一百萬元之鉅。以兩個商人，一個小公警員，敢如此爲非作歹，殊値得嚴密注意。根據常識判　，這關案的內容，決不致如此的簡單。又本月二日報載，滬市常有一般不逞之徒，偽稱係日軍部或憲兵隊暗探，向無辜市民橫加脅迫，詐取金錢，日憲兵隊當局，爲此特發表談話，其要點如次：</p>
<p>（一）自本年初至四月底止，破獲冒名索詐案件計二十七件，罪犯三十六名，其中華人二十三名，日人及其他國人十三名，經判刑者十二件，即席處分者五件，騙遂出境者三件，其他尙在愼重調查中。</p>
<p>（二）軍部人員以及憲兵，當執行職務之際，常持有身份證明書及服務紀錄薄，不獨無要求金錢物品等行爲，即　似脅迫之言動等，亦絕對避免。</p>
<p>（三）此輩不逞之徒，冒　日軍威信，應予嚴厲處分，不稍寬貸。市民如感覺有捏造憲兵或憲兵隊暗探名言，而有不法舉動者，應立即報吿就近憲兵隊，以便拘捕。</p>
<p>（四）希望中日市民相警相戒，協力當局從事取締，以期達到建設明朗大上海之目的。</p>
<p>我們從以上的兩段紀載，加以分析，則本月二日日憲兵當局的談話，毌寗是對之輩不逞之徒下的嚴重警吿。而昨天又有冒名案件發生，在時間上不過間隔三個星期，不逞之徒故態復萌，誠堪痛恨，雖置諸重罰亦不足惜。不過，這案件是已經破獲的，也許還有其餘未被破獲的同性質案件。雖則當局盼望當事的市民據實報吿，可是市民昧於情勢，在「怕事的心理」之下，而甘於隱忍者，亦復不少。這固然是市民的「缺點」。然而這種「缺點」殘留的結果，不但市民隱忍受詐，同時，更助長這輩不逞之徒爲非作歹的風氣，而爲憲兵當局取締的障礙。所以，凡是受詐的市民，爲怕事而隱忍的「缺點」，不但不爲當局所諒解，而且必爲當局所不滿。因爲這是足以阻止當局厲行取締的障礙。</p>
<p>根據上面的分析，我們認爲要取得市民相警相戒，協力當局，澈底取締這類案件，就必須先高潮消除市民「怕事心理」的「缺點」，才能收穫實效。那末，究竟怎樣消除這「缺點」呢？我們的管見如次：</p>
<p>（一）請憲兵當局公吿詳細的各區駐在地點，管轄地段，辦公時間，並設專門接受市民報吿或訴寃的特殊組織，設置有訓練的通譯，俾市民遭遇意外威脅時，即可直接報吿。</p>
<p>（二）請憲兵當局更胚體規定執行人員的標識，尤其是便衣的暗探，並在執行時先行出示標識，俾市民辦別眞偽，而不爲不逞之徒魚目混珠，遂其索詐。</p>
<p>（三）市民如遇軍憲查詢，不必慌張，如自問並無不端行爲，儘可坦白應對。如認爲來者懷疑，則不存怕事心理，據實向所屬憲兵部報吿。必須瞭解這是協力當局取締不逞之徒應有的舉動。</p>
<p>我們更從上面的事，聯想到友邦日本駐滬機關的事權，也有明確的一元化規定的必要建議。願意聯帶的申說，盼望各有關當局參致和採納。</p>
<p>第一，凡是政治的，經濟的，治安的，社會的各類事件，其執行權貴，應屬何種機關，應有明確的規定，除絕對秘密者以外，一切均應公吿周知，使市民咸知遵從。</p>
<p>第二，凡是性質類似的事件，其執行權責，應屬之於一個機關。同時，明確公吿，使市民咸知遵從。例如經濟調查工作或社會事件中徴用房屋，規定爲甲機關執行者，乙機關就不必再有此執行權責，而使市民無所遵從。</p>
<p>我們曾於本月二十三日，歡迎谷大使的短評中，說過：「目前中日之間，尤其是中日人民之間的情感，已有　著好轉。不過，我們也不能忽視足以阻滯進一步好轉的障礙，尙未完全消滅，尤其是易被忽略的「小節。」……我們主張「大政策」與「小阻礙」，要平等調整。「小的不留神，耽誤了大的，」這是最不幸的事。」我們衷心期望上海的友邦各當局特別關心與上海市民有關的「小節」的調整，俾更進一步增進雙方情感。我們相信同時也是友邦人士的衷心期望。因此，我們敢於重複的提出，以作我們的結論。</p>
<h3>專論　兩種親日派</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>日前發表了「中國知識階級的騎牆主義」一篇文章，中國的一位讀者寄給我一封信，加以劇烈的攻擊。他從日本對於東三省的處置，和大東亞戰爭後日本所提倡的大東亞主義互相矛盾的立塲上說起，最後作結論道：「中國全國人民，不問是否知識階級，都希望以一萬架飛機轟炸日本，爲我人民報仇，以滅亡日本。」在中國，對日本抱著這種感情的人還不少。有些人說：如果不忘民族在戰爭時的仇恨而互相殺戮，則全世界的人類，早就悉數消滅了吧。可是失掉了更改的盲目的愛國心，在人類的進化和國家命運的發展上，的確並不是危險的。假使依照這位中國讀者的希望，中國賴英美的援助而滅亡了日本，則在以後的亞細亞，能夠排除英美帝國主義之壓力的獨立國，是一國也不會存在的。在那種塲合上，中國或許可以恢復自主獨立，但這是和現在的墨西哥是完全的獨立國這個意義一樣的「獨立國」。我們不能以爲中國的民族革命，是爲了內容這樣的空虛的「獨立自主」而奮鬥着的。認爲滅亡日本，中國即可得到自主獨立的人們，應該再讀一遍孫中山先生的下面的話：</p>
<p>「中國今日想求友邦，除日本和美國以外，是求不到的。日本和中國的關係，實在是存亡安危都相關聯的。　有日本，就沒有中國；沒有中國，也沒有日本。中國和日本，　在種族上看來，是兄弟之國；中國和美國在政治上觀之，是師徒之邦。中國和日本，應該以亞細亞主義，開發太平洋以西的富源；美國應該以門羅主義，統一太平洋以東的勢力。」</p>
<p>孫中山先生在中日兩國間的命運的相互關係中，認識了「沒有日本，就沒有中國；沒有中國，也沒有日本」這種歷史的不可分性。他想發展中國，所以希望日本發展；他憂慮中國的存亡安危，所以很關心日本的存亡安危。山孫中山先生的理論推斷起來，日本滅亡，中國也滅亡；日本成爲二等國，中國也不能成爲二等以上的國家。這實在是「同甘共苦」的立塲。</p>
<p>同時，對於和中國有不可分的命運的日本所不需要的傾向，如同憂慮本國一樣而憂慮之。日本以前受英美文化毒化的時候，孫中山先生提出警吿道：</p>
<p>「日本民族一方面輸入歐美的霸道文化，別方面並也有着亞細亞的王道文化的本質。日本今後對於世界文化成爲西洋霸道的工具呢，還是成爲東亞王道的干城？這是日本國民應該愼重考慮的。」</p>
<p>將孫中山先生的對於日本的這種態度，和這位中國讀者的態度，以及企圖連絡英美滅亡日本的重慶歐美派的態度比較起來，可知期間有怎樣大的距離呢？</p>
<p>我們把如孫中山先生那樣，自覺中國和日本的「同生共死」的歷史的命運，基於這自覺而行動的中國人，呼爲親日派。質言之，第一，親日派者，是以中國的愛國者爲前提的。愛日本甚於愛中國的中國人，和愛男人甚於愛女人的男人一樣，是一種變態，這種精神狀態，很可懷疑。不愛本國的中國人，當然不能愛日本。第二，親日派者，是以認識日本是「東亞王道的干城」爲前提的。換句話說，是以認識日本民族的偉大性當作解放亞細亞的推進力爲前提的。向英美要求解放亞細亞的推進力者，不消說，不是親日派。</p>
<p>對於「新日派」的認識，無論在日本方面，或在重慶方面，一向是很曖昧的。是否曾在日本留過學？是否會說日本話？是否娶有個日本女人？是否會掉弄親日的言詞？以前是根據這些條件，而簡單地分別是否親日派的。在事發前抗日運動高漲時代，「親日派」如有這些條件，發跡就比「英美派」遲。但在目前，「親日派」如有這些條件，比「英美派」有更多像這種的「發財」機會。對於親日派的認識的不夠，即在現在的政治上也生出了可悲的事態。</p>
<p>在十二月八日以前，重慶方面極力宣傳日本的侵略，大部分國民信而元疑的時代，能夠和日本接近的，只有兩種人：即是犧牲比生命更重要的自己的名譽，而求國家在望之出路的人；或自始就沒有可犧牲的名譽，爲了金錢什麼都想幹一下的人。在所謂「親日派」中，是這樣地玉石不分的。這裏爲使得起見，想將眞正的親日派，呼爲第一種親日派，後者呼爲第二種親日派。</p>
<p>第二種親日派，開頭就有着易於成爲所謂「漢奸」的素質。他們多少懂得一點日本話，又進而製造和日本人接觸的機會，由此結成特殊關係，趁着戰局混亂，任意爲非作惡。有的利用官廳的名義捕人，勒索巨款，有的操縱金市塲，掠奪良民的積蓄；總之：凡威脅，敲詐，殺人等非法之事，無所不爲。和平區域的人民，對於榨取民脂民膏，積有幾千百萬財富的那些所謂「漢奸」之流，都是贈以憎恨的目光的。這種事實，不知污蔑了多少第一種親日派的名譽？</p>
<p>又以阿諛接近日本人，投日本人之所好，餽贈禮物，獲得其他中國人所不能享有的特權而飽私囊者，也是第二種親日派。一部分日本人見到了，以非常卑謙的態度接近自己的許多中國人，說一般中國人的奴隸根性是如此如此；然而像這樣糊塗的事是沒有的。他們只是看見了中國人的渣滓。一部分日本人，從這些中國人的渣滓裏，接受了錯誤的中國觀，然後提出廉價的「解決事變論」。這勢力，是決不可輕視的。全面和平到今日還停頓着的一個理由，便是受了這錯誤的中國人觀的影響。</p>
<p>第二種親日派，是沒有國家觀念的猶太式的存在。在他們的眼裏，沒有中國，也沒有日本。有的，無非是自己的利害關係。因此，和平運動的終極的目的雖然在於全面和平威脅他們的地位之　，則就要妨害全面和平的進行。知道囤積是破壞人民的生活，使國家的財政傾於危機的，自己卻首先實行囤積，想阻碍取締。一面明知雅片和賭博是有關國家興亡的萬惡之事，一面還是暗中企圖存在下去。</p>
<p>申報上發表過一篇題爲「肅清和平區內的失散主義者」的社論，說「現在和平區內一般人，尤其是黨政人員，對和平信念缺乏堅定性」，將他們稱之爲和平失敗主義者，或動搖分子。早報強調他們的行動如何影響一般國民對於和平運動的信念，主張有肅清他們的必要。要知道這裏所說的和平失敗主義者，也分明是第二種親日派的一部分。眞正的親日派，爲保守自己的名譽起見，也非將狐假虎威的似是而非的親日派，從和平運動裏排除出去不可。</p>
<p>第一種親日派是愛國者，第二種親日派是漢奸·此二者，在實踐上，都是應該加以嚴格的區別的。</p>

<h3>日大本營昨午發表　阿圖島海空軍戰果　美艦沉毀及負傷者共達七艘　島上日軍亦邀擊美登陸部隊</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日大本營二十四日下午四時發表：（一）帝國海軍航空部隊，二十三日於阿圖島附近擊毀敵巡洋艦一艘，擊沉驅逐艦一，使其他一艘起火，我方無損害。（二）帝國海軍潛艇部隊，十二日以來，於阿留申方面繼續攻擊行動中之敵艦艇，截至現在止，重創敵戰艦，巡洋艦各一艘，並使艦型不詳之二艘負傷。</p>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日大本營二十四日之發表中，曾指出日海軍機隊及潛艇部隊近在阿圖島附近收獲莫大戰果，計掣毀敵巡洋艦一艘，擊沈驅逐艦一艘，又燬其另一艘，並重創敵戰艦。巡洋艦各一艘及擊傷艦型未詳之敵軍艦二艘。茲據此間軍事專家談稱：美軍之圖奪回日軍佔領之阿國島，欲以此作爲對日反攻作戰之據點，乃於五月十二日在該島實行登陸，迄今已歷十餘日，日海軍部隊亦即迅速出動北海，克服該方面之惡劣氣候，繼艦實行計劃週密之作戰，以擊滅敵方有力海軍部隊。同時，美軍登陸部隊已遭阿圖島日守軍之邀擊。加以該島附近滿埋地雷，故敵軍並未能完成其所期之登陸目的，而日本潛艇部隊自十二日以來，即以魚雷艇續猛攻敵方艦艇，並於海面敷設機雷，截至廿四日止，已擊毀敵巡洋艦一艘，輕傷艦型未詳之敵軍艦兩艘，其詳細戰果，因該方面濃霧瀰漫，故不易確認，是以日大本營發表中所稱，擊毀敵戰艦及巡洋艦各一艘云者，預料其或已沈沒。又日海軍機隊等，於廿三日呼應陸上部隊長驅出擊，冒北海惡劣天氣及敵方猛烈之防空砲火，猛炸敵艦，計炸燬敵巡洋艦一艘，炸沈驅逐艦一艘，並炸毀其另一艘。按此等敵艦均曾在阿圖島掩護敵軍登陸，並圖作爲進攻日本北方之用，故預料敵方經此打擊，其兵員·兵器·彈藥·燃料·糧食等，均喪失綦重。而日海軍於敵方實行反攻之前，即先發制人獲此偉大戰果，其意義實至重大。</p>
<p>日空軍襲吉大港擊毀敵機卅四架</p>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日大本營二十四日上午十一時三十分發表：帝國陸軍航空部隊，二十二日曾急襲吉大港飛機塲，幾將該地集中之敵機全部擊毀，所獲戰果如次：（一）空戰中擊落敵機十九架。（二）擊毀地上敵機十五架，我方損失一架。</p>
<p>仰光二十四日中央社電　日陸軍航空部隊，二十一·二兩日急襲孟加拉灣英空軍基地哥克斯巴薩及吉大港兩機塲，擊墜及擊毀敵機三十八架，詳情如次：（一）二十一日戰鬥機隊冒惡劣天氣，空襲哥克斯巴薩機塲，與敵機十數架交戰，擊墜其二架，又擊墜勃萊哈姆型機一架，歸還途中遇敵機九架，擊墜其一架，日機自炸一架。（二）二十二日以戰鬥轟炸機聯合大編隊，奇襲吉大港機塲，炸中地上大型機二架，中型機二架，擊毀地上大型機一架，中型機三架，小型機八架。同時，日轟炸機隊利用密雲，進至吉大港機塲上空時，昨戒該機塲上空之敵機達三十餘架，但竟未發現日機襲入，及日森炸隊達成任務後，欲返回基地時，始發覺日機，乃圖追擊，然爲密雲所阻，反成日戰鬥機隊之好餌，日機當擊墜敵機十九架，日機自炸者一架。</p>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　緬甸方面日陸軍航空部隊，二十二日九時四十分，以戰鬥機，轟炸機運合大編隊，急襲東部印度敵重要軍事基地，吉大港機塲，對地上敵機加以猛烈轟炸，擊墜，擊毀敵機三十四架，敵機殆全被擊滅。是日正値一年前日加藤建夫少將於孟加拉灣壯烈戰死之日，日陸軍航空部隊於阿拉坎協力陸上部隊作戰，獲得光輝之空中戰果，據日大本營十四日發表，阿拉坎方面之作戰，以日軍佔領敵重要據點孟多而告終，敵奪回緬甸之企圖，已全成泡影。敵軍棄屍六四一四，俘虜五七四，該作戰中之空戰戰果，尤爲驚人，計擊墜擊毀敵機實達五五二架，邇來日陸軍航空部隊呼應日陸上部隊屢次襲擊吉大港機塲，將集結中之敵機全部擊滅，擊碎英印空軍之反攻企圖。又敵軍爲挽回阿拉坎作戰之慘敗，圖謀再起曾於吉大港集中多數飛機，然經此次攻擊，陷於全滅狀態。</p>
<p>里斯本二十四日中央社電　據墨爾缽來電，西南太平洋反軸心軍司令部發表：本航空部隊二十三日夜曾空襲摩勒斯比。</p>

<h3>鄂中日軍報道班長發表　佔領漁洋關經過</h3>
<p>漢口二十四日中央社電　據鄂南前綫訊，此間日軍報道班長於二十四日說明日軍佔領漁洋關經過，及其意義，大意謂，漁洋關爲渝軍防衛重慶之最前綫，經日軍快速部隊之猛攻後，已於二十二日傍晚歸入日軍手中。日軍部隊自猛攻公安西方之渝方第十集團軍以來，已歷數日，連續向巴山山脈嶮峻挺進，其奮鬥情形，實深可敬佩。良以該處戰塲，爲拔出海面二千公尺左右之山地，日軍須穿越高達數百公尺之絕壁進攻。渝軍爲阻止日軍前進，已將唯一之前進橋樑加以破壞，故日軍部隊咸冒渝軍之槍彈開闢道路，或涉足水深二公尺之急流，搭架橋樑，克服一切困難，向前挺進，終將渝方第八十七第九十四兩軍等六師憑據頑抗之天然要害漁洋關佔領。按漁洋關位於宜昌西南，爲渝方防軍第十集團軍之補給基地，且爲渝第六戰區之第一要隘，故在戰略上實爲一極重要之據點。今旣被日軍攻佔，則渝方所受打擊之重大，自不難想像。</p>

<h3>東歐前綫繼續沉寂　德蘇準備夏季決戰　庫班橋頭堡蘇軍猛攻未獲逞　唐納資中部對德壓力亦鬆弛</h3>
<p>柏林二十四日中央社電　德元首行營二十四日正午發表戰况稱，東綫皆爲局部戰鬥。</p>
<p>柏林二十四日中央社電　東綫德·蘇兩軍，現正積極準備夏季攻勢，但軍事專家認爲因東綫氣候及其他之自然條件，故發動大規模作戰之時間，或較去年稍遲，但亦有認爲夏季作戰有出乎意外，而提早開始者。據德軍前綫消息傳，蘇軍刻正在莫斯科南方與庫斯克戰綫集結大量步兵部隊與有力之坦克車部隊。蘇軍於冬季反攻作戰時，未能攻下庫班橋頭堡，今於德軍開始夏季攻勢之前，復對該地發動猛攻，但結果卒未得逞。又蘇軍對於奧萊爾方面之德軍，亦有拚命加以猛攻之情勢，總之，本年之夏季攻勢，乃爲此次世界大戰之決戰期，不僅可左右本年全面戰局，且反軸心陣營之戰營，亦必遭受重大影嚮，故殊堪注意。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十四日中央社電　柏林來訊云：東綫繼續沉寂，蘇軍之局部進攻，均被德軍擊退。過去二十四小時內，德空軍極爲活躍，共在東綫上空擊落蘇機五十三架，克里姆斯加亞區域內，德戰鬥轟炸機曾襲擊蘇聯鐵道，尤以伏爾强斯克及庫斯克兩車站被炸最烈，有運貨車多輛中彈起火。莫斯科無綫電訊承認，昨有有蘇戰鬥機十架被德方擊落，據稱：德機羣奮勇衝破蘇聯驅逐機之包圍，飛抵庫斯克鐵道中心點，在市內投　轟炸各目標，蘇機迎戰被擊落十架。</p>
<p>柏林二十三日中央社電　此間官方謂，東綫戰鬥之沉寂，乃決戰前之「喘息」時間，星期六全部戰綫皆甚沉寂，但現已有局部之偵察及攻擊部隊之活動，以打破沉寂。在中部地區大雨淋漓，不能有大規模作戰，但德空軍殊爲活動，轟炸在伏爾强斯克及庫斯克地區從事編配之蘇軍。在南部戰塲及中央地區進行中之蘇軍，爲德轟炸機所擊散，蘇軍對唐納資中部里斯强斯克附近山丘德軍陣地之壓迫，已漸緩弛。此開軍界相信，如蘇軍進攻，則作戰地帶，似將爲克里姆斯加雅特姆魯克或諾伏洛西斯克等地。</p>
<h3>英機襲德國西部　共損失三十八架　德亦轟炸英港及造船廠</h3>
<p>柏林二十四日中央社電　德元首行營今午發表戰報，西部戰綫（一）反軸心空軍二十三日夜空襲魯爾地方之多特蒙德，投下大量炸彈及燒夷彈，居民受相常損害。（二）德快速戰鬥機轟炸機隊，白晝奇襲英格蘭南部之普恩穆斯及哈斯丁等各港。（三）德空軍二十二日夜再度大舉空襲英薩柴特之造船廠，市內及港灣設施等處。均中彈起火。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十四日中央社電　據倫教來電，英空軍部二十四日發表謂，英機二十三日晚空襲德國西部時，英損失轟炸機卅八架。又謂，德機曾於二十三晚轟炸英國東北海岸都市，各處受相當損害。</p>
<h3>日醫院船一艘　又遭敵機襲擊</h3>
<p>仰光二十四日中央社電　日醫院船二十二日上午十時半，於仰光河口附近航行中，突遭敵機七架襲擊，其中三架對該船加以機槍射擊後，向南方飛去，損害詳情尙不明。敵軍對日醫院船出以此種殘暴行爲，今年以來巳達十次，被襲擊之船計八艘，日軍將兵對此莫不異常激憤。</p>

<h3>美驅逐艦一艘　採用黑人名號</h3>
<p>馬德里二十三日中央社電　德國新聞社訊據華盛頓來電稱：美驅逐艦一艘，取名爲「哈蒙」號，以紀念在爪達拉嘉拉一役中戰死之黑人哈蒙，此在美海軍歷史中尙屬創見。</p>
<h3>國際簡訊</h3>

<h3>制空與海上戰局　（三）</h3>
<p>— 佐藤喜一郎　譯自改造五月號</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>同年七月在地中海所展開的斯蒂列呷海口的海戰，也是把握由空中而來之制海權奏凱歌的一個例。同月七日，由阿列基桑特利港出口的英艦隊，爲向沿海飛機塲進發的義大利轟炸隊所襲擊，八日整天受了十次轟炸。別方面，由琪布甫爾太港出口的英艦隊，九日又被從西四里島起飛的義轟炸機羣，反覆轟擊了一天，巡洋艦甫特號，航空母艦阿克洛亞號，都受損傷，慌忙駛同到琪布甫爾太港去，醜態畢露。其次，自十日至十三日，阿列基桑特利艦隊又被里比亞，特台加納斯羣島方面的義機，轟炸了四十次，受創很重。</p>
<p>但在同年十一月的太芬特海戰，主客倒反，對於英國空軍，義國海軍站在極其不利的立塲上。企圖在哥爾甫島作戰的義大利艦隊，同月十一日，集結於太芬特灣，英國艦隊察知此事，即於同夜將艦隊主力秘密並列於太芬特灣口，義艦隊出口前的兩小時，以全部艦隊及飛機攻擊。轟炸機和需擊機合共約一百架，義艦隊的損害，據發表戰艦加勃爾號沈沒，戰艦利特里級兩隻，巡洋艦兩隻，都受破損。</p>
<p>此外，在地中海，有同年二月的瑞諾亞作戰，三月的馬太巴岬海口海戰，對於義大利海軍，都留下了不光榮的戰績。</p>
<p>在叙說制空之便不得不附帶提一筆的，是飛機對艦艇所掩護的運輸船團的攻擊。遝輸船如今也相常有了武裝的設備，據某外國報所計算的商船防空火力表如下圖：（假定以五隻艦艇掩護十五隻商船時）</p>
<p>武裝總數　整隻商船（一分鐘的發射數）</p>
<p>高射砲　高射機關槍　高射砲　高射機關槍</p>
<p>運輸船　一五—三〇　一五—三〇　三〇〇—六〇〇　四五〇〇——九〇〇〇</p>
<p>護送艦　一〇—一五　二〇—四〇　二〇〇—三〇〇　六〇〇〇—一二〇〇〇</p>
<p>合計　二五—呈五　三五—七〇　五〇〇—九〇〇　一〇五〇〇—二一〇〇〇</p>
<p>不過運輸船，從來是臨急時所湊集起來的烏合之衆，吃水和載重都很輕微，因此如上表所示，武裝雖有，向敵機有效適切地集中全部火力，却是很困難的。從飛機方面說，例如德國空軍最初的戰法，以梅塞旭彌特——。級的重機，攻擊　衛隊，而减低戰鬥力，掩護轟炸機對運輸船的攻擊。運輸船中第一彈就向各方漂散，再遭轟炸，則受致命傷，這是極普通的情形。攻擊被護送的商船，就飛機而言，是最容易的作戰，但地點若在敵航空基地的附近，總之是敵方的制空圈內時，也很難接近，這是當然的。</p>
<p>如前面各例所示明的一樣，當海上決戰時，要求航空兵力的優勢，獲得制空權爲先決條件。尤其從陸上基地的行動半經內的會戰，是最所被希望的，但是沒有航空兵力，而進入敵方制空權內的危險，徵諸英國海軍第一次挪威作戰的失敗，也是很明白的</p>
<p>關於日本航空部隊在大東亞戰爭中的活躍，已經沒有多說的必要。航空機怎樣支配海上戰局的呢？這由於日本大本營報這部對夏威夷，馬來海口各海戰，及最近南太平洋海戰的發表，在讀者的腦裏深深地刻印着吧。</p>
<p>制空權的有無，左右海上的戰局。這至少是近代戰本質上的眞理。（完）蕭譯</p>
<h3>海軍魂　（一）　砲塔員</h3>
<p>— 中村研一</p>
<p>也不是深夜，也不是黎明，而天色比海色少微亮的時候。很難知道是晴天抑是陰天？尙未天亮的長光，距離全體起床的時間尙相當早，但已經穿上白色工作服及戴上帽子的砲塔員，不使發出一點聲音，悄悄地走近砲塔，推開笨重的門而消逝於塔內。不大工夫從砲的仰角鑽出，而又開始向下面走下去。突然所有的砲塔，在起床前，已經開始猛烈的自發演習。發現把傳統的箍頭手巾在前夕已經供在軍艦的神像前面，自己却在朦朧的燈光下，一心祈禱的兵士。擁有一切近代裝備的這一黑色鋼鐵水面浮城，好像只是爲了駝負着這數門主砲一樣。每個漁船的布帆也都逃不出視綫。就是以這類東西爲目標而在積極練習着。砲塔與砲塔在作着拚命的競賽。頭排艦與二排艦，戰隊與戰隊，艦隊與艦隊，都各自在作者拚命的競賽。而在這種猛烈訓練中特別賦與聲色的砲彈，一定會打中英美的軍艦。星期一二三的早晨，中午，晚上以外，別人尙在夢中時，自己還有一點空時間（濤：譯自朝日新聞）</p>

<p>滬甬航路自去歲恢復通航後，兩地居民往返旅行，頗感便利，惟目前雖已有新寗紹·常山·華霖·萬生·等四輪，在滬甬航綫中通行，但因往返旅客之衆多，截至目前，每班仍有人滿之息，而購買船票一事，遂亦不便，茲據大通社記者從可靠方面消息，於以前常在滬甬航路行駛之德平輪，在最近期內，頗有獲得有關當局核准恢復直放之可能，同時對於船票之價格，亦將由當局負責維持固定，如有弊寳，當予懲處。</p>

<h3>新聞聯合會主辦　日海軍展覽會揭幕　陳列各種照片蔚爲大觀　新聞界今日參觀出雲艦</h3>
<p>日本第三十八屆海軍節紀念週，由上海新聞聯合會及美術報國會聯合主辦之「日本海軍紀念展覽會」，昨日在南京路大新公司四樓畫廳揭幕。自朝至夕，參觀者不下萬餘人。足徵本市人民對於日本海軍認識之一般，茲將詳情誌次：</p>
<p>會塲陳列各種照片</p>
<p>會塲設大新四樓畫慶，地址寬大，故陳列物品，數量衆多。進門處爲日本海軍旗一幅，日本海軍照片一張。陳列照片中之第一張，爲三十八年前率領日海軍擊滅俄國强大艦隊之東鄕元帥，又有上月間在南太平洋指揮全面作戰卒以身殉國之山本聯合艦隊司令遺像一幀。其旁爲山本大將繼任者古賀司令近影。畫廳內部正中，則爲大東亞共榮圈油漆地圖一大張。其他照片，計有夏威夷·馬來·印度洋·泗水·新幾內亞·珊瑚海·及所雜門各地海戰圖，日海軍英勇作戰之精神，盡溢紙上，他如陸戰隊·航空隊·兵校·艦上生活·軍艦威容·新中國海軍及上海海洋少年隊之照片，或描寫作戰之情形，或介紹訓練之內容，或顯現海軍人員之起居操作方式，或强調日本現代海軍配備之整齊。另有日本學童作品百餘幀，着以五彩，描寫軍人生活，足以表示日本學生對於海軍之認識。此外復有「海水之色」·「海洋深度」·「海水成份」·及「珊瑚礁」等圖案多幅。</p>
<p>輪船模型形態逼眞</p>
<p>展覽出品，除照片外，又有古今戰船演進圖十餘張，自四千年前之作戰木船起，以迄於現代戰艦，演進情形，一覽無餘，又有近代各種船式，有沙船·貨船·油船·漁船·商船·郵船及淺水船等之別，萃集一堂，蔚爲大觀。各種軍艦圖案，亦有陳列，展覽品中之立體型而爲觀衆仔細欣賞者，爲各種輪船軍艦等之模型。形態逼眞餘則爲日本學童所製之船型。大小不一，以普通船隻爲多，軍艦次之，大者一二吋，小可五六呎，圍觀者衆，未曾目覩軍艦眞象者，藉此亦可知其一二，又新聞聯合會所出之慶祝日海軍紀念日特刊，在會塲分送，除叙述日海軍戰果及其傳統精神外，對於該會工作，亦有概括叙述。</p>
<p>今日參觀出雲旗艦</p>
<p>紀念日海軍節之展覽，除上述由新聞聯合會及美術報國會所主持者外，於前日開幕者：計有（一）南京路江西路口大東亞文化報導館之紀念展覽，陳列者有各種戰艦及飛機之模型，戰事照片，統計圖表，及五彩漫盡等。（二）中華電影聯合公司在大光明及大華兩戲院內陳列各種海軍照片。（三）虹口國際劇塲及上海劇塲內，有同盟社·朝日新聞社·每日新聞社·讀賣新聞社·及大陸新報社主辦之海軍從軍照片展覽，又新聞聯合會與日海軍報導部接洽就緒，定於今日下午三時招待各報社記者前往參觀出雲旗艦，先於二時四十分在外灘艦隊報導部三樓集合，一同出發，按出雲艦在日俄戰時，建有殊勳，現爲艦隊司令駐節之所。</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>華北災荒的敎訓</h3>
<p>古人說：「大兵之後，必有大疫，」鑒於近世醫學昌明，防疫周到，此說幸而不中。古人又說：「大兵之後，必有大饑，」鑒於戰事延長，相持不決，此說恐將不幸而中。最近華北各省吿饑，籲請華中華南運糧救濟，不過是古言不幸而中的一例。我們推原其故，且爲人道着想，實在要呼籲國內全面光榮和平的早日到來。</p>
<p>造成此次華北災荒的其他原因，聞爲（一）雨量稀少，（二）富人囤糧，（三）外糧不來，（四）棉田推廣，及（五）其他無益作物的廣棺。救濟雨量稀少的根本辦法，似須從廣植森林及多盤水井下手；取締富人囤糧的澈底辦法，似爲查倉與搜宅，然後者實騷擾不堪，流弊甚大；救濟外糧不來的妥善辦法，爲以華北的鈹產易華中的農產，而且先要便利運輸，解放禁令：至推廣棉田，本亦旨在解決衣的問題，未可厚非，設能進而以華北之棉易華中之米，那就更好了，至其他無益作物的廣植一點，吾人希望此後華北民衆能痛定思痛，不再圖近利，忘遠害，速即改種有益作物——五穀糧食——以免饑荒的再來。</p>
<p>「民以食爲天，」古時如此，現在如此，何時不是如此？當饑荒魔鬼來襲之日，人們始恍然覺悟重農政策的具制宜，目前救災如救火，吾人言增加生產者，幸勿捨本而逐末！</p>
<h3>經濟局繼續登記　八項主要商品　自六月一日起至三十日止</h3>
<p>上海特別市經濟局以棉花·火柴·肥皂·臘燭等主要物品總登記業自四月五日起開始辦理後，展期至本月十日截止，期滿大致均已登記完竣。茲奉實部頒發主要商品品目表內所列主要商品中尙有（一）毛織維及毛製品，（二）繭，（三）絲及絲製品，（四）工業油脂，（五）烟葉，（六）玻璃（包括原料及製品）（七）電器具（包括原料及製品）。（八）皮革（包括原料及製品）等八項。未在上次舉辦總登記之內，故決定將上列八項主要商品，自六月一日起至六月三十日止，繼續舉辦登記，望儲藏主要物品者，一律遵照辦理云。</p>
<h3>商統會與實糧二部　統制物資項目</h3>
<p>全國商統總會成立後，蘇浙皖三省及京滬兩市區域以內之物資統制，較諸過去已大見緩和。然除該會物資統制審議委員會所規定之統制物資以外，尙有實業部與糧食部所規定之統制物資。茲將商統總會與實糧二部三方面所規定之三十七項統制物資錄下：</p>
<p>商統會</p>
<p>物資統制審議會所決定之統制物資，本爲十一項，近又追加四項，共計十五項，計：（一）小麥（二）麵粉（三）雜糧（四）油脂原料（五）棉紗棉布（六）牲畜（七）肥皂（八）洋燭（九）火柴（十）砂糖（十一）烟葉（十二）棉花（十三）蔴類及其製品（十四）羊毛（十五）皮革。</p>
<p>實業部</p>
<p>實部決定之統制物資，共計十八項，計：（一）棉花（二）棉紗（三）棉織品（四）化學工業樂品（原料，西藥，顏料，染料，酒精包括在內）（五）毛織品及毛製品（六）繭（七）絲及絲織品（八）工業油脂（九）蠟燭（十）肥皂（十一）火柴（十二）煤及煤球（十三）烟葉及捲烟（十四）橡膠原料及製品（十五）五金（鐵，鋼，白鐵，金屬原料及製品均包括在內）（十六）玻璃原料及製品（十七）電氣器具原料及製品（十八）皮革原料及製品</p>
<p>糧食部</p>
<p>糧部決定之統制物資，共計六項，計：（一）麵粉（二）雜糧（包括小麥，元麥，大麥，玉蜀黍，花生，大豆，蠶豆）（三）牲畜（包括牛，羊，猪，鷄，鴨，猪油）（四）鷄鴨蛋（五）糖（六）食油（包括生油，菜油，棉油）。</p>
<h3>物資統制審議會舉行第三次會議</h3>
<p>物資統制審議委員會，前於京滬召開委員會識已歷兩次，明日下午三時，於國際俱樂部舉行第三次委員會議，所有該會委員，屆時均將赴京出席。</p>
<h3>粉麥專委會將派員收買小麥</h3>
<p>全國商統會粉麥專業委員會，自本月二十日宣吿正式成立後現內部組織機構已完全決定，分八科二十一股，辦理小麥收買與配給麵粉麩皮之運銷，價格之調整，品質之檢騐，與生產之增進，及改良等事宜，並進行在上海蘇州無錫鎭江常州泰州南京蕪湖蚌埠等九處主要粉麥產銷地方籌設分會，以期加强收買及製造等工作。據悉該委員會以本年新麥即將登塲，收買小麥亟待進行，特責由小麥科與審核科製成調查表，於本星期內先行派員前往蘇浙皖三省小麥產區內生產狀况，及中日雙方工廠製粉情形，曁需要小麥原料數量，與製粉生產量，以爲收買小麥及配給同業之張本，同時該會小麥科與粉麩科將準備根據調查結果，第一步爲收買小麥工作，以便配給粉廠製粉供給民食需要云。</p>
<h3>交通銀行計劃　設立農業倉庫</h3>
<p>交通銀行農業經濟處，決定新農業放款計劃，業已開始舉辦此業務。是項計劃，對於各方均有重大影響，頃據該行經濟處稱：某農具製造廠擬申請借款一千萬元，某農塲擬申請借款二十萬元，關於合作社，農業倉庫之加强與添設等項問題，刻正硏究之中其中合作社問題，各情已誌報端，關於設立與合作社具有密切關係之農業倉庫一事，因資材與資金等之關係，頗多困難，雖欲將各鎭之寺院或民房修葺而闢作中小倉庫，但亦非易事，結果尙須由交行董事長唐壽民氏與糧食部當局折衝進行，緣該行之農產品担保與現在糧食部之收買食糧政策，決不能衝突，故糧食部委託交行代辦部份收買糧食事宜，頗成問題，關於農業貸款問題，據該行農業經濟處稱：</p>
<p>據我人所知，關於貸款銀團之組織，尙未其體化，或許唐氏已與其他有力銀行之間進行具體協議，亦未可知，本處刻正趕訂敝行之農業貸款業務方針，關於農業倉庫問題，事變前與現在，在倉庫農產品價格，利息等各方面，均有重大變化，且糧食部已發行糧食庫券而收買米穀，則開設農業倉庫非與糧食部取得完全諒解不可，以上爲一般原則。總之倉庫問題尙未具體化，須俟本處計劃完全就緒後，則推進農業貸款業務方能健全。（雲鵬：譯自五月二十四日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>銀錢業承兌貼現票據　組小組會議審核</h3>
<p>銀錢業各行莊爲推行商業承兌匯票，已由銀行學會訂立票據承兌貼現實施方案等。提交銀行公會核議。已組小組會詳爲審核。頃銀錢公會已分函行莊從事硏究云。</p>
<h3>華股趨勢</h3>
<p>昨華股農初穩堅，然黃金已狂落，銀根日緊，致不久復趨慘厲疲落，各股在求現賣勢中，午刻尤形虛軟，然亦有例外者，若華綸毛羢，景福杉襪廠與通易信託公司。老股中之中國內衣，忽爲新老投資者之目標，市旣活躍，價亦向上進展，恐因櫬衫等貨堅升所致，永安公司及中國國貨則在賡續漲落中。新新公司獨站關口。華豐綢廠·永安紡織·又國光印染等小票面紡織業股，均乏人問津，價步在賣勢中喊低，新藥業之中法藥房與新亞藥廠價小後不乏進者，午刻轉穩，軋小尙微。閘北水電·華商電氣及南洋烟公司又大中華火柴等股價，均與上週六無變化，文化業中華與世界二書局呆平，商務缺少進者而吿銳退，久安實業平定，中聯電影與新益地產價疲莫能與中國鐘廠無進者，下跌亦巨。</p>
<h3>經濟局核准籌組　舊貨同業公會</h3>
<p>本市舊貨業同業公會，自呈奉市經濟局核准後，由郭燕亭積極開始籌備調查，事變後物資奇窘之秋，舊貨一業因適合平民經濟購買能力，是以尤見蓬勃，但該業素無一貫之營業方法，致不肖之徒，往往利用舊名義陰謀剝削平民利益，殊爲社會所詬病，該公會爲切實整飭同業計，一俟正式籌組竣事，即將訂定各項規程通吿同業一體遵守。</p>
<p>讀者論壇</p>
<h3>論棉布問題　（續）</h3>
<p>— 李之華</p>
<p>（四）照第　三條規定辦法，凡已登記之各貨，因已由公會決定其命運，往後交易，自決不致超過限價。在不超過限價原則下，對於棧單，亦得准其自由買賣，而使製造商及批發商間之金融，藉以圓滑。但每一棉布商可以存貨之　量，其最多額爲若干，必須規定，以免有囤積之嫌。根據上列辦法，製造商及批發商之黑市交易，自可消減；但門市店之另售價，是否能避免黑市，胥視配給額之多寡以爲斷；倘當局所統計之棉布存量，供給需用年份皆爲碗當，則配給額當然不致過少，黑市亦即不致發生，反之；則惟有計口授布之一法。否則，其結果正一似過去軋油，軋糖，以迄最近之軋香烟等等事　，於人民旣無實益，反多糾紛。</p>
<p>總之：處此戰時，因通貨不易緊縮，物價上漲，自難盡免。但如當局對於全盤計劃，參酌　善，固亦不難獲致較佳之效果也。　（完）</p>
<p>大衆生活　薪水階級的小職員　用一</p>
<p>際此百物飛漲的今日，在一般財主們，固然是不受影響，但一般平民們，莫不叫苦連天。尤其是我們薪水階級的小職員們，除了整日埋首工作，甚至流盡汗血。還要承受上司的敎訓。而每天所吃的，惟有粗菜淡飯，有時實不能下咽。每月所得的，祇是八九十元的代價。試問讀者，這些錢那裏能够去養活家中的老小呢？就是連個人的零用難以維持。幾使我們的生活喘不過氣來。譬如說：每月中的理髮洗浴費，便要二十元的光景。買一雙紗襪，也要十七八元。再加上香烟費，至少要三四十元。別的且慢說，單拿上面幾項來講，已經要達七八十元了，那末還有多少錢能餘下來呢！如果要買一雙鞋子，就是最經濟的車胎底鞋，亦非得有四五個月的積蓄不可。做衣服那是更談不到了。雖然時常聽說：要加薪水了，心裏好像注射了一針興奮劑般的高興，但結果終不能成爲事實。眞所謂：「只聽見扶梯響，不看見人下來。」使我們大大的失望。有時，同事中偶然有患病了，或是家中有急需之用，不得已要向當局去商量借些錢，手續眞是麻煩極了。先要塡寫聲請書，註明理由，尋覓妥保，再須經上峯的核准，然後才能如願。有時或竟遭拒絕，也是說不定的。反過來說：他們的生活呢，除了在交易上的應酬外，天天終是在燈紅酒綠的塲中，度着醉生夢死的生活。進出雖然沒有汽車，至少也是人力車代步。冬天在家裏開起了水汀電爐，夏天開起了電風扇。日常吃的，不是山珍，便是海味。要用錢了，只要一張支票，問出納科支付。假如把「吃力不賺錢，嫌錢不吃力。」這二句話用在這裏，那是再適當也沒有了。總之，在今日的社會上一般薪水階級，都感到有生活維艱之苦，長此以往，實在足以影響本位工作的努力，及地方上的治安。現在簡陋的寫了些，來向社會人士，地方當局，作竭力的呼籲，希望能給予我捫以有力的援助吧！</p>

<p>沈信卿先生八十大壽特輯</p>
<h3>沈信卿先八十大壽</h3>
<p>— 武進蔣維喬謹撰</p>
<p>自古賢哲之士。內蘊堅貞之志。外鮮嗜欲之累。保其本眞。如太璞之不琢。習於勤勞。如戶樞之不蠧。若斯人者。往往能年登耄耋。而神明不衰。如吳縣</p>
<p>沈信卿先生所謂賢哲之士非歟。先生少而敦敏徇齊。其學以通經致用爲主。尤長於訓詁。書法由顏柳而入王。詩歌逼近李杜。年十五補博士弟子員。至甲午而舉於鄕。戊戌以後。國中先覺感知我國積弱。外患頻仍。非變法興學無以圖存。先生雖捷鄕圍。無意仕進。以躬行敎育爲職志。會淸延下詔與學。乃倡議以夙昔藏修之龍門書院。改設師範學校。而被任第一任監督。學子彬彬。執經講藝。未及數年。成績昭著。各省聞風仿效。惟恐或後。辛亥國體變更。先生以民國聚興。人應盡責。遂進江蘇都督府。主司民政。慎選牧令。澄淸吏治。而兵興以後。全省學校。均吿停輟。先生努力規復。加以整理。省縣公私各校。由是重聞弦歌之聲。都督府改組。先生即引退。而主持江蘇省敎育會。是時東西各國。敎育學說。日新月異。則取其合我國國情者。集會員研究之。研究有得。則供獻當局。期施諸實行。度開講座。以公諸學界。民國六年。先生與同志提倡職業敎育。後遂成文中華職業敎育社。先生苦口婆心。隨處講學。對於靑年以敬業樂羣爲勗。以使無業者有業有業者樂業爲敎育之旨趣。職業敎育之聲。乃洋溢於全國矣。民國十三年。與知友數人。創設甲子社。搜輯現代史料。廣　報章雜誌。凡朝章國故。兵刑禮樂。水利農田。社會風　。罔不分別部居。加以剪綴。牙籤萬軸。若網在綱。旋擴充爲人文圖書館。葉鴻英先生見而韙之。慨然捐助基金。乃改名鴻英圖書館。先生長館事將及廿年。每日到館。雖風雨寒著無間。近雖聽覺與步履稍見衰象。而精神依然煥發。猶策杖力疾從公。愛先生者多勸其休養。而先生毅然勿顧也。先生愛國救世之心。老而彌篤。邇來悲天憫人。復創融五講經社友孔聚學會。意在和會各敎。共進大同。表彰儒術。期於實踐。何其願力之弘歟。今先生年八十矣。六月一日爲攬揆之辰。其執友知先生之向不祝壽。而言行多可記者。諉余爲之序。余惟先生所以克臻大年。而神明不衰者。一勤字足以槪之。易曰天行健。君子以自疆不息。傳云民生在勤。勤則不匱。此之謂也。因着於篇後。俾後生知所矜式焉。</p>
<h3>我所知之沈信卿先生</h3>
<p>— 潘仰堯</p>
<p>信卿先生一生行事，以「不苟」兩字，常自勉勉人。昔主辦江蘇省敎育會時，處理公牘，雖一字之誤，必改正而後已，力戒辦文書者不得絲毫草率。輒謂筆墨一涉潦草，便知其人辦事粗玩，無可取矣！故在先生處辦過職務者，其人必護慎精細，動中繩墨，即知平日得力於光生之以身作則，訓練有素也。</p>
<p>先生平時最致力於講學，大學易經兩書，尤獨得其奧旨。「天行健，君子以自强不息」一語，先生常詔勉後學深切體味，尤服膺孔子「知其不可而爲之」之精神，爲最堪師法。先生嘗念「君子無人而不自得也」一語，更見傳大寬厚，樂天知命之旨趣。其修養功夫，胥從此中玩味得來，實爲先生致壽之徵。</p>
<p>先生爲學，一寵樸實以致用爲指歸。故民國六年，與大江南北之敎育碩彥，創導職業敎育，設社提倡，往來講學，必以「精業」「樂業」爲勗，使「無業者有業，有業者樂業」，亦爲先生生平敎育之目標。當時職社定社徵，取決於先生；先生顧謂任之先生曰：「今而後爲雙手萬能之時代，即以雙手爲誌可乎？」其崇拜實學，可見其用心深矣。先生歷主各機關，嚴於取與之間，抱定會計公開之旨，於賬目最爲嚴格，雖分毫之微，不肯稍涉苟且，所謂一介不取，一介不以與人一語，先生有焉。</p>
<p>先生獎勵後學，無微不至。見靑年有一善之長，必稱譽弗衰，誘掖勗進。靑年因鼓勵而努力向上者，不在少數。惟平生疾惡如仇，不稍掩飾，見人言行涉於荒誕者，必面斥其非，不肯有所瞻徇，故當時不免有後言；顧日久之後，其人憬悟，轉而感激沸零，認爲先生誠無愧爲諍友爲嚴師！</p>
<p>先生道德文章，爲時傳誧，而書法尤雄渾莊麗，人爭寶之。惟不肯隨便徇人之請，劣紙不書，摺扇不書，鄙其人者不書。曾記有一老友求其書扇凡十餘年，到底未得先生許可。此種强毅堅決之精神，亦可覘先生爲人之堅忍不拔矣。</p>
<p>先生自民國初年，謝職蘇民政司後，矢志服務社會，絕意政治。黎黃陂時代，慕先生名，任爲湘敎廳長，先生堅辭不就，辭呈有願以在野之身，爲芻蕘之獻，襟懷恬澹，於此可見。</p>
<p>先生對於時局及一切觀察，充滿樂觀之精神。盱衡世事，懷念未來，絕不悲觀。見諸論談、發爲詩篇，均寓積極勇往之旨。猶記昔年家庭日新會集會時，余侍先君赴會，與先生談甚久，先生顧謂余曰：「君尊人襟懷曠達，處處有春氣，可喜也。」先君長公二歲，不幸以嵒疾棄養，每念及此，爲之神傷。</p>
<p>先生詩胎息深厚，直追唐人氣韻，二十餘年來，余每晤先生，必出近作見示，或手抄一紙授余，故舊篋中頗多先生畢寶，彌可珍貴。昔年南游時，每月必得先生手書，書中必以新詩見贈，惓惓之意。益見老輩之眞摯誠篤。猶憔馬相伯先生居土山灣時，先生發起千齡集，每值相老生日，輒造其居，作文酒之會，名賢畢集，先生即席成詩，和者甚多。某歲相老百歲生日，先生郵書寄越，作百韻詩祝之，秀麗工整。今相老已婦道山，當時與會之前輩，亦多風流雲散，回想當時，不勝於邑。惟千齡集曾由我師陸規亮先生刋印成書，以留鴻雪。</p>

<h3>我所知道的沈信卿先生</h3>
<p>— 白蕉</p>
<p>民國十八年初夏的一個上午，由黃任老的介紹，我初次與沈信卿先生會見於小桃園弄的人文圖書館。「嚴肅堅强」，是他給我最初的印象。</p>
<p>人文圖書館是甲子社蛻化擴充所成，與甲子社同爲沈先生和諸友好所發起，也便是現今鴻英圖書館的前身。先生天天準時辦事，事無積壓，二十年如一日。</p>
<p>先生做事的精神，就在「不苟」與「鎭定」。潘仰堯先生記先先生平行事，以不苟兩字自勉勉人，說起「昔年主辦江蘇省敎育會時，處理公牘，雖一字之誤，必改正而後已，力戒辦文書者不得絲毫草率，輒謂筆墨一涉潦草，便知其人辦事粗玩」。不錯，先生隨便寫一張便條，也筆筆到家，絕不草率。</p>
<p>當民國二年，先生爲民政司時，南京都督府被黃興圍困，當時一般辦事人員，聞警失措，獨先生還照常看去公事二百件！那種鎭定的功夫，正見得先生嚴肅堅强和不苟的本色</p>
<p>先生不肯隨便放過時間，公餘從事於著述，不是手不釋卷，便是筆不停揮。在路上，先生坐在車內，雙手捧書，望夫恰像一個「文昌」。他重實踐服膺孔氏知其不可而爲之的精神。他講中庸道不遠人章常說：「言顧行行顧言」二語，初學當從此下手。又說中庸與大學相同之點，最重一「誠」字，立誠功夫，最重「慎獨」二字。又說大學「彼爲善之小人之使爲國家」當作一句讀。爲善之小人當五字連讀，爲善猶偽善也。這尢爲發前人所未發，因光生的精於小學，才有此發見，得此明白確切的斛說。他的學術思想全出於儒家，但是異乎所謂「道學」，他很風趣。他很愛少年人談種種問題，處處誘掖後進，誨人不惓。他自己從不認老，古稀後頭上還沒有一莖白髮，取老子語「若嬰兒子之未孩」刻了「方印，又自號若嬰。</p>
<p>先生治學，深於易經訓詁考證，所著有易學史，春秋地名今釋，這兩部專著，當然是了不得的。記得吾友顧喬若先生當年欲爲先生刋印後面的一種，屢請於先生，先生說：「正恐尚有未妥，還要修正，不敢即以問世。」於此可見先生對於著述的鄭重態度。先生在六十歲後詩興尤其好，作詩更多。一詩脫稿，總是走來找我，「推敲推敲，請你改改」，老輩謙下的態度，眞不可及。</p>
<p>先生又於書法，由柳入手，後來學王。但他的楷書，在大家看來轉似魯公的氣息。先生的臨習方法，是由大化小，由小化大。關於集聯方面，有石經，蘭亭叙，陶，杜，李長吉，各家的詩，和宋詞等，總共有幾百副。</p>
<p>先生不飲酒，不抽烟，他的嗜好是瓷和書畫。據說先生的先德翔之先生，所藏古瓷法書名畫很富，可惜都被太平天國的　先鋒刦掠一空。現在先生所收藏的瓷器精品有二百個瓶，遂以二百瓶名齋。書畫也不少，關於這方面，也有瓷錄，書畫錄兩種著述。</p>
<p>先生平日很注意攝生，每天行十五分鐘體操，自五十歲到七十餘歲，二十多年沒有間斷過。對於天時塞暖，他是非常謹慎，每天到鴻英圖書館，我們常看見他坐車出入，老是隨身帶着一個白色的衣包。他不時要看寒暑表，作爲他更衣的標準。</p>
<p>由先生的行事不苟，作字用敬，注意攝生，於是成爲他的「壽者相」。</p>
<p>先生繼袁觀瀾先生長鴻英圖書館。鴻英迄爲海上有數的圖書館，藏書十五萬餘冊，各類案引卅二三萬片，史料選輯迷一百八十餘萬片，每月閱覽人數平均爲八九百人，但經費方面，近年因幣制改變，頗形竭蹶，於是先生便日以增加經費爲希望。今年六月一日，正當他八秩壽辰，但是先生生平絕對不主張做壽的；本市各界先進，因先生的道德文章，舉世共仰，當此大慶，不能不有紀念，於是發起公視，以先生之志爲志，移嘉賓觴酒，藉充鴻矣圖書館經費，壽人壽世，長留紀念。這才得到先生首肯，於是乎先生八十而初慶！</p>

        <h1>1943.05.25</h1>
<h3>A Request to Local Authorities of Allied Nations</h3>
<p>Yesterday, it was reported that a case of extorting money under the guise of the Japanese Military Police occurred in this city. Fortunately, the Military Police authorities detected it beforehand, and the perpetrators were arrested on the spot and transferred to the Military Tribunal for trial. The Japanese Military Police also stated that to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, anyone who uses the name of the military or the Military Police to commit wrongdoing, regardless of nationality, will be severely punished. It has been found that the perpetrators in this case were only three people: a fishmonger, a shop clerk, and an employee of the Tax Bureau, yet the target of the extortion reached a staggering one million yuan. It is truly worthy of close attention that two merchants and a minor police officer dared to commit such acts of wrongdoing. Based on common sense, the details of this case are definitely not that simple. Moreover, it was reported on the 2nd of this month that unscrupulous individuals in Shanghai often falsely claim to be undercover agents of the Japanese military or the Military Police, and extort money from innocent citizens. The Japanese Military Police authorities issued a statement in response, with the following key points:</p>
<p>(1) From the beginning of this year to the end of April, a total of twenty-seven cases of extortion under false pretenses were uncovered, involving thirty-six criminals, including twenty-three Chinese, thirteen Japanese, and other nationalities. Twelve cases have resulted in sentencing, five cases have been dealt with summarily, and three cases have involved perpetrators fleeing the country. Other cases are still under careful investigation.</p>
<p>(2) Military personnel and Military Police officers always carry identification cards and service record books when performing their duties. Not only do they not demand money or goods, they absolutely avoid any words or actions that resemble coercion.</p>
<p>(3) These unscrupulous individuals, who tarnish the reputation of the Japanese military, should be severely punished without any leniency. Citizens who suspect that someone is fabricating the name of the Military Police or undercover agents and engaging in illegal activities should immediately report it to the nearest Military Police station for arrest.</p>
<p>(4) It is hoped that Chinese and Japanese citizens will be vigilant and cooperate with the authorities to crack down on these activities, in order to achieve the goal of building a bright and clear Greater Shanghai.</p>
<p>Analyzing the above two records, the statement issued by the Japanese Military Police authorities on the 2nd of this month was undoubtedly a serious warning to these unscrupulous individuals. And yesterday, another case of impersonation occurred, only three weeks later. It is truly detestable that these unscrupulous individuals have relapsed into their old habits, and severe punishment is not enough. However, this is a case that has already been solved. Perhaps there are other similar cases that have not been solved. Although the authorities hope that the citizens involved will report the truth, many citizens, ignorant of the situation, choose to remain silent due to a "fear of trouble." This is certainly a "shortcoming" of the citizens. However, the consequence of this "shortcoming" is not only that citizens silently endure being defrauded, but it also encourages these unscrupulous individuals to commit wrongdoing and obstructs the Military Police authorities' crackdown. Therefore, the "shortcoming" of citizens who are defrauded but remain silent out of fear of trouble is not only not understood by the authorities, but it is certainly resented by the authorities. Because it is enough to prevent the authorities from vigorously carrying out the crackdown.</p>
<p>Based on the above analysis, we believe that to achieve vigilance among citizens, cooperation with the authorities, and a thorough crackdown on such cases, we must first raise the tide and eliminate the "shortcoming" of citizens' "fear of trouble" in order to achieve practical results. So, how exactly do we eliminate this "shortcoming"? Our humble opinions are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) We request the Military Police authorities to publicly announce the detailed location of each district's station, the area under its jurisdiction, and its office hours. They should also set up a special organization to accept citizens' reports or grievances, and provide trained interpreters so that citizens can report directly when they encounter unexpected threats.</p>
<p>(2) We request the Military Police authorities to further stipulate the identification marks of the enforcement personnel, especially undercover agents, and to show their identification marks before performing their duties, so that citizens can distinguish the real from the fake and prevent unscrupulous individuals from passing off fish eyes as pearls to achieve their extortion.</p>
<p>(3) Citizens should not panic when encountering military or police inquiries. If they believe that they have not engaged in any improper conduct, they can answer frankly. If they suspect the questioner, they should not be afraid of trouble and report the facts to the Military Police Department to which they belong. It must be understood that this is a proper action to assist the authorities in cracking down on unscrupulous individuals.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we are reminded by the above matters that the authority of the Japanese Resident Agencies in Shanghai should also have a clear and unified regulation. We would like to make a supplementary statement, hoping that the relevant authorities will consider and adopt it.</p>
<p>First, for all types of political, economic, security, and social events, the executing power should belong to which agency, should have clear regulations. Except for those that are absolutely confidential, everything should be publicly announced so that citizens will know and obey.</p>
<p>Second, for events of a similar nature, the executing power should belong to one agency. At the same time, a clear announcement should be made so that citizens will know and obey. For example, if economic investigation work or the requisition of houses in social events is stipulated to be carried out by Agency A, then Agency B should no longer have this executing power, so that citizens do not know who to obey.</p>
<p>We said in a short commentary welcoming Ambassador Gu on the 23rd of this month: "At present, the feelings between China and Japan, especially between the Chinese and Japanese people, have already begun to improve. However, we cannot ignore the obstacles that hinder further improvement, which have not been completely eliminated, especially the 'small details' that are easily overlooked...We advocate that 'major policies' and 'minor obstacles' should be adjusted equally. 'Small carelessness delays the big,' this is the most unfortunate thing." We sincerely hope that the authorities of allied nations in Shanghai will pay special attention to the adjustment of "small details" related to the citizens of Shanghai, so as to further enhance mutual feelings. We believe this is also the sincere expectation of people from allied nations. Therefore, we dare to repeat this as our conclusion.</p>
<h3>Special Article: Two Types of Pro-Japanese Factions</h3>
<p>— By Yoshida Toyosuke</p>
<p>The other day, I published an article entitled "The Opportunism of the Chinese Intellectual Class." A Chinese reader sent me a letter, vehemently attacking it. He started from the contradictory stance of Japan's handling of the Three Eastern Provinces and the Greater East Asia Doctrine promoted by Japan after the Greater East Asia War, and concluded: "The entire Chinese people, regardless of whether they are intellectuals, hope to bomb Japan with ten thousand airplanes to avenge our people and to destroy Japan." There are quite a few people in China who hold this kind of sentiment towards Japan. Some people say that if we do not forget the ethnic hatred during the war and kill each other, then all the humans in the world would have been wiped out long ago. But losing the blind patriotism that cannot be changed is indeed not dangerous for the evolution of mankind and the development of the national destiny. If, according to the wishes of this Chinese reader, China relies on the assistance of Britain and the United States to destroy Japan, then there will not be a single independent country in Asia that can eliminate the pressure of Anglo-American imperialism in the future. In that case, China may be able to restore its independence and autonomy, but this is the same meaning as the "independent country" that Mexico is now, which is completely independent. We cannot assume that the Chinese national revolution is fighting for such empty "independence and autonomy." People who believe that China can achieve independence and autonomy by destroying Japan should read Sun Yat-sen's words again:</p>
<p>"Today, China wants to seek allied nations, and it cannot seek them except from Japan and the United States. The relationship between Japan and China is really related to survival and security. Without Japan, there would be no China; without China, there would be no Japan. China and Japan, from the racial point of view, are brother countries; China and the United States, from the political point of view, are teacher-student countries. China and Japan should use Asianism to develop the resources west of the Pacific; the United States should use the Monroe Doctrine to unify the forces east of the Pacific."</p>
<p>In the interdependent relationship of the fate of China and Japan, Sun Yat-sen recognized the historical indivisibility of "without Japan, there would be no China; without China, there would be no Japan." He wanted to develop China, so he hoped that Japan would develop; he was worried about the survival and security of China, so he was very concerned about the survival and security of Japan. According to Sun Yat-sen's theory, if Japan perishes, China will also perish; if Japan becomes a second-rate country, China cannot become a country above second-rate. This is really a position of "sharing joys and sorrows."</p>
<p>At the same time, he was as concerned about the tendencies that Japan, which has an inseparable fate with China, did not need, as he was worried about his own country. When Japan was previously poisoned by Anglo-American culture, Sun Yat-sen issued a warning:</p>
<p>"On the one hand, the Japanese nation imports the hegemonic culture of Europe and the United States, and on the other hand, it also has the essence of the royal culture of Asia. In the future, will Japan become a tool of Western hegemony for world culture, or will it become a supporter of Eastern royal culture? This is something that the Japanese people should carefully consider."</p>
<p>Comparing Sun Yat-sen's attitude towards Japan with the attitude of this Chinese reader, and the attitude of the Chongqing European and American faction that attempts to unite with Britain and the United States to destroy Japan, one can see how great the distance is between them.</p>
<p>We call Chinese people like Sun Yat-sen, who are aware of the historical destiny of "coexistence and death" between China and Japan and act based on this awareness, pro-Japanese. In other words, first, pro-Japanese people are based on the premise of being patriots of China. Chinese people who love Japan more than China are like men who love men more than women. It is a perversion, and this mental state is very suspicious. Chinese people who do not love their own country cannot love Japan. Second, pro-Japanese people are based on the premise of recognizing that Japan is a "supporter of the Eastern royal culture." In other words, it is based on the premise of recognizing the greatness of the Japanese nation as the driving force for liberating Asia. Those who ask England and the United States for the driving force to liberate Asia are, needless to say, not pro-Japanese.</p>
<p>The understanding of "new pro-Japanese people" has always been ambiguous, whether on the Japanese side or on the Chongqing side. Have you ever studied in Japan? Can you speak Japanese? Are you married to a Japanese woman? Can you spout pro-Japanese words? In the past, people simply distinguished whether they were pro-Japanese based on these conditions. In the era of rising anti-Japanese movements before the incident, "pro-Japanese people" with these conditions had a slower rise than "Anglo-American factions." But currently, "pro-Japanese people" with these conditions have more opportunities for "making a fortune" like this than "Anglo-American factions." The lack of understanding of the pro-Japanese faction has also created a sad situation in current politics.</p>
<p>Before December 8, in the era when Chongqing vigorously promoted Japanese aggression and most of the people believed it without a doubt, only two types of people could get close to Japan: those who sacrificed their reputation, which was more important than life, and sought a way out for the country; or those who had no reputation to sacrifice from the beginning and wanted to do anything for money. In the so-called "pro-Japanese faction," there was such a mixture of good and bad. To make it easier here, I would like to call the true pro-Japanese faction the first type of pro-Japanese faction, and the latter the second type of pro-Japanese faction.</p>
<p>The second type of pro-Japanese faction has the quality of easily becoming a so-called "traitor" from the beginning. They understand a little Japanese, and then create opportunities to contact Japanese people, thereby forming special relationships, taking advantage of the chaos of the war situation, and doing whatever they want. Some use the name of the official office to arrest people and extort huge sums of money, and some manipulate the gold market and plunder the savings of good people; in short, they do everything illegal, such as threats, extortion, and murder. The people in the peaceful area all look at those so-called "traitors" who have accumulated millions or even billions of fortunes by squeezing the people's fat with hatred. This fact, I don't know how much it has defamed the reputation of the first type of pro-Japanese faction?</p>
<p>Those who flatter and approach Japanese people, cater to their preferences, give gifts, and obtain special privileges that other Chinese people cannot enjoy and fill their own pockets are also the second type of pro-Japanese faction. When some Japanese people see many Chinese people approaching them with a very humble attitude, they say that the slave nature of the average Chinese person is like this and that; but there is no such muddled thing. They only saw the dregs of the Chinese people. Some Japanese people accepted a wrong view of China from these dregs of Chinese people, and then put forward a cheap "theory of solving the incident." This force is absolutely not to be underestimated. One of the reasons why the overall peace has stalled to this day is the influence of this wrong view of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>The second type of pro-Japanese faction is a Jewish-style existence without a national concept. In their eyes, there is neither China nor Japan. There is nothing but their own interests. Therefore, although the ultimate goal of the peace movement is overall peace, they will obstruct the progress of overall peace because it threatens their status. Knowing that hoarding is destroying the people's lives and making the country's finances tend to crisis, they themselves are the first to hoard and want to hinder the crackdown. On the one hand, they clearly know that opium and gambling are evils that are related to the rise and fall of the country, but on the other hand, they secretly attempt to exist.</p>
<p>Shen Bao published an editorial entitled "Clearing the Defeatists in the Peaceful Area," saying that "now the general public in the peaceful area, especially party and government officials, lack firmness in their belief in peace," calling them peace defeatists or vacillators. Zaobao emphasized how their actions affect the general public's belief in the peace movement, and advocated that it is necessary to eliminate them. It should be known that the peace defeatists mentioned here are also clearly a part of the second type of pro-Japanese faction. In order to protect their own reputation, the true pro-Japanese faction must also exclude the pro-Japanese faction that is like a fox pretending to be a tiger from the peace movement.</p>
<p>The first type of pro-Japanese faction is a patriot, and the second type of pro-Japanese faction is a traitor. In practice, these two should be strictly distinguished.</p>

<h3>Imperial General Headquarters Announced Yesterday Afternoon: Naval and Air Combat Results at Attu Island: A Total of Seven U.S. Ships Sunk, Destroyed, and Damaged; Japanese Troops on the Island Also Intercepted U.S. Landing Forces</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 24th: (1) On the 23rd, the Imperial Navy Air Force destroyed an enemy cruiser and sank a destroyer near Attu Island, setting another on fire. We suffered no damage. (2) Since the 12th, the Imperial Navy submarine force has continued its attack operations against enemy ships in the Aleutian area. As of now, it has heavily damaged one enemy battleship and one cruiser, and has injured two other ships of unidentified types.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The announcement by the Imperial General Headquarters on the 24th pointed out that Japanese naval air squadrons and submarine forces had recently achieved great combat results near Attu Island, destroying one enemy cruiser, sinking one destroyer, destroying another, and heavily damaging one enemy battleship, one cruiser, and two unidentified enemy warships. According to military experts here, the U.S. military's attempt to recapture Attu Island, occupied by Japanese forces, and use it as a base for counter-offensive operations against Japan, led to a landing on the island on May 12. Now, it has been more than ten days. The Japanese naval forces quickly dispatched to the northern seas, overcoming the harsh climate in that area, and continued to implement meticulously planned operations to destroy the enemy's powerful naval forces. At the same time, the U.S. landing forces have been intercepted by the Japanese defense forces on Attu Island. In addition, the area around the island is full of landmines, so the enemy has not been able to complete its intended landing. Since the 12th, Japanese submarine forces have continued to attack enemy ships with torpedoes and laid mines on the sea. As of the 24th, they have destroyed one enemy cruiser and lightly damaged two enemy warships of unidentified types. Due to heavy fog in that area, it is difficult to confirm the detailed results. Therefore, the Imperial General Headquarters' announcement that one enemy battleship and one cruiser were destroyed is expected to mean that they have probably sunk. In addition, on the 23rd, Japanese naval air squadrons responded to the land forces and launched a long-range attack, braving the harsh weather of the northern seas and the enemy's intense anti-aircraft fire, bombing enemy ships. They destroyed one enemy cruiser, sank one destroyer, and destroyed another. These enemy ships had all been protecting the enemy's landing on Attu Island and had attempted to use it as a base for attacking northern Japan. Therefore, it is expected that the enemy has suffered heavy losses of personnel, weapons, ammunition, fuel, and food due to this blow. The Japanese Navy's pre-emptive strike before the enemy launched its counter-offensive and the achievement of this great combat result is of great significance.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Attacked Chittagong, Destroying 34 Enemy Aircraft</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 11:30 AM on the 24th: On the 22nd, the Imperial Army Air Force launched a surprise attack on the Chittagong airfield, destroying almost all of the enemy aircraft concentrated there. The results are as follows: (1) 19 enemy aircraft were shot down in aerial combat. (2) 15 enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground. We lost one aircraft.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 24th (Central News Agency) – On the 21st and 22nd, the Japanese Army Air Force launched surprise attacks on the British Air Force bases in Cox's Bazar and Chittagong in the Bay of Bengal, shooting down and destroying 38 enemy aircraft. The details are as follows: (1) On the 21st, a fighter squadron braved harsh weather and raided the Cox's Bazar airfield, engaging with a dozen enemy aircraft, shooting down two of them, and also shooting down one Blenheim-type aircraft. On the way back, they encountered nine enemy aircraft, shooting down one of them. One Japanese aircraft was self-detonated. (2) On the 22nd, a joint formation of fighter-bombers launched a surprise attack on the Chittagong airfield, hitting two large aircraft and two medium aircraft on the ground, and destroying one large aircraft, three medium aircraft, and eight small aircraft on the ground. At the same time, when a Japanese bomber squadron used dense clouds to advance to the airspace above the Chittagong airfield, the enemy aircraft in the airspace above the airfield yesterday numbered more than 30, but they did not discover the Japanese aircraft attack. When the Japanese bomber squadron completed its mission and wanted to return to its base, it was discovered by the enemy aircraft, which attempted to pursue, but was blocked by dense clouds, becoming an easy target for the Japanese fighter squadron. The Japanese aircraft shot down 19 enemy aircraft. One Japanese aircraft was self-detonated.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – On the 22nd, the Japanese Army Air Force in Burma, at 9:40 AM, launched a joint formation of fighters and bombers to surprise attack Chittagong airfield, an important enemy military base in eastern India, bombarding enemy aircraft on the ground, shooting down and destroying 34 enemy aircraft. Almost all enemy aircraft were destroyed. That day marked the first anniversary of the heroic death of Lieutenant General Kato Tateo in the Bay of Bengal. The Japanese Army Air Force cooperated with the land forces in Arakan, achieving brilliant aerial combat results. According to the Imperial General Headquarters' announcement on the 14th, the Arakan operation concluded with the Japanese army occupying the enemy's important stronghold of Maungdaw, and the enemy's attempt to recapture Burma had completely failed. The enemy abandoned 6,414 bodies, and 574 prisoners were taken. The aerial combat results in this operation were particularly impressive, with a total of 552 enemy aircraft shot down and destroyed. Recently, the Japanese Army Air Force has repeatedly attacked Chittagong airfield in response to the Japanese land forces, destroying all the enemy aircraft that were gathered there, and crushing the counter-offensive attempt of the British Indian Air Force. Furthermore, in order to reverse the disastrous defeat in the Arakan operation, the enemy planned to regroup and had concentrated a large number of aircraft in Chittagong, but they were completely destroyed in this attack.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Melbourne, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Command announced that its air force had raided Port Moresby on the night of the 23rd.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Melbourne, Japanese bombers raided Exmouth Gulf on the west coast of Australia on the 20th and 21st. This is the southernmost point that Japanese aircraft have ever reached.</p>
<h3>In Commemoration of Admiral Yamamoto's Spirit: Japan Launches National Movement; The Imperial Rule Assistance Association Has Sent Telegrams Everywhere Urging the People to Respond</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The spirit of the late Admiral Yamamoto has been transferred to Tokyo on the 23rd. The Japanese people deeply express their condolences, while further strengthening their determination to destroy England and the United States, vowing to continue Admiral Yamamoto's spirit and strive for the final victory of the war. The heightened mood has reached its climax, and groups are planning to commemorate the undying spirit of Admiral Yamamoto. The Political Council of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association has decided to launch a major national movement in order to promote the people to inherit the spirit of the admiral, work hard, enhance wartime will, and increase war power. On the 22nd, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association convened a meeting of the heads of its affiliated organizations at its headquarters to discuss concrete plans. As a result of the discussions, it was decided to send telegrams to various places to clarify the purpose of the movement and call on the national people to respond in unison. From today onward, it instructed branches across the country and affiliated organizations to launch the movement based on this spirit. The main points of the telegram are as follows: "The late Admiral Yamamoto led the army at the beginning of the war to defeat the U.S. Pacific Fleet in Hawaii, and then defeated the British Far East Fleet in the Malay Sea. In the year and a half that followed, he repeatedly led the army and commanded the entire army, displaying his loyalty, courage, and resolute strategy. Now, he has unfortunately died for his country in the South China Sea. When we think of the admiral's loyal and heroic spirit, we are even more determined to destroy the bitter enemy. Now, Commander-in-Chief Koga has succeeded Admiral Yamamoto in leading the army. The morale of the front-line soldiers is greatly boosted, and the Japanese Combined Fleet will unleash its power to control the ocean. We are willing to emulate Admiral Yamamoto and comfort his spirit. We are determined to be loyal, abide by our duties, regard our positions as battlefields, and serve the country with our lives. We will use the total strength of 100 million people to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, and move towards the path of annihilating England and the United States and completing the Greater East Asia War, in order to comfort the admiral's spirit." On the 22nd, the Political Council also convened a standing general affairs meeting at noon, and then convened an emergency general affairs meeting to discuss measures to promote the fighting spirit of 100 million people with the spirit of the admiral's martyrdom. As a result of the discussions, it was decided to use the loyal and heroic spirit of the late Admiral Yamamoto as the spirit and engage in a national movement to attack England and the United States and enhance fighting spirit. Concrete measures will be decided after consulting the opinions of various departments at the general affairs meeting to be held on the 25th. In addition, the Japan Industrial Patriotic Association also decided to dedicate one day's labor income on the day of Admiral Yamamoto's state funeral to the navy. In addition, the Niigata Prefectural Association, composed of those from Niigata Prefecture, the hometown of Admiral Yamamoto, also held an emergency meeting on the 22nd to discuss commending Admiral Yamamoto's spirit. As a result, they unanimously advocated setting up the "Admiral Yamamoto Scholarship" to cultivate naval volunteers. Therefore, the Japanese people's determination to destroy England and the United States has been strengthened even more due to the admiral's martyrdom.</p>
<h3>Chairman Wang Posthumously Awarded Admiral Yamamoto</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) – Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Japanese Combined Fleet, unfortunately died heroically in the South Pacific while commanding operations this time. When the sad news arrived, our government and the public were deeply saddened. Chairman Wang of the National Government believed that Admiral Yamamoto had assisted greatly in our country's naval reconstruction work during his lifetime. His unfortunate death this time is a major loss for East Asia. Yesterday, he specially decided to posthumously award him the Special Class Tongguang Medal to express his respect and condolences.</p>
<h3>Japanese Reporting Squad Leader in Central Hubei Announces: The Course of Occupying Yuyang Pass</h3>
<p>Hankou, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to news from the southern Hubei front lines, the Japanese reporting squad leader here stated on the 24th, explaining the process and significance of the Japanese army's occupation of Yuyang Pass, roughly saying that Yuyang Pass was the foremost defense line for the Chongqing army defending Chongqing, and after a fierce attack by the Japanese army's rapid troops, it fell into the hands of the Japanese army on the evening of the 22nd. The Japanese army troops have been advancing continuously towards the precipitous Bashan mountain range for several days since fiercely attacking the Chongqing 10th Army Group west of Gongan. Their fighting spirit is truly admirable. Because the battlefield there is a mountainous area about 2,000 meters above sea level, the Japanese army had to traverse cliffs hundreds of meters high to attack. In order to prevent the Japanese army from advancing, the Chongqing army had destroyed the only bridge forward. Therefore, the Japanese troops braved the Chongqing army's gunfire to open roads, or waded through rapids two meters deep, building bridges, overcoming all difficulties, and advancing forward, finally occupying Yuyang Pass, a natural stronghold where the Chongqing 87th and 94th armies and six divisions tenaciously resisted. It is reported that Yuyang Pass is located southwest of Yichang and is the supply base for the Chongqing 10th Army Group and the first strategic pass of the Chongqing 6th War Area. Therefore, it is a strategically extremely important stronghold. Now that it has been captured by the Japanese army, the magnitude of the blow suffered by the Chongqing side can be easily imagined.</p>

In addition, a total of 848 Chongqing and Communist military facilities were destroyed, of which 541 were on the Communist side, which is sufficient to prove that the focus of the Japanese North China Expeditionary Army's operations is on suppressing the Communist army, and this battle is truly noteworthy.</p>

<h3>Anti-Communist Commander Conference in Progress, Pang Bingxun Gives Speech</h3>
<p>Kaifeng, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to reports, General Pang Bingxun, Commander-in-Chief of the Provisional 24th Army Group, delivered a speech at the Peace Anti-Communist Commander Conference on the 23rd, entitled "The Chinese Communist Party," strongly arguing that suppressing the Communists is saving the country. The attending generals were deeply moved after listening. The gist of his speech was roughly as follows: To save the country, we must have peace. To seek peace, we must first suppress the Communists. To suppress the Communists, we must have sufficient military force. Now, with the cooperation of our friendly nation Japan, we are closely united and determined to annihilate the common enemy of Greater East Asia, the Communist Party. From any perspective, the Communist Party is definitely not suitable for Chinese social organization. The ultimate goal of the Communist Party is one-party dictatorship and the tyranny of the producing class. The Chinese Communists plunder the people's food, strip merchants of their profits, and implement a reign of terror. We are now determined to exert all our strength to confront them. With the cooperation of Japan, we can often defeat their military force.</p>
<h3>The Sino-Russian War: Records from This Newspaper Thirty-Eight Years Ago - Re-copied from Old Newspapers (4)</h3>
<p>Japanese Generals Who Can Write Poetry (Published in this newspaper, No. 1131, on the 4th day of the 9th lunar month of the 30th year of Guangxu, Wednesday, October 12, 1904 in the Western calendar)</p>
<p>A certain Japanese newspaper in Tokyo said: General Hasegawa, whose courtesy name is Rikkodo, when the campaign against Russia began, was ordered to go to Korea and then fight in various parts of Manchuria. His great achievements and outstanding exploits are well known, but it is not known that his literary skills are unmatched by others. He once showed a friend three quatrains he had written recently on a fan. One was titled "Garrison Troops Listening to the Xiao in Fenghuangcheng," and the poem said: "The lake city is full of dark willow barracks, and wild geese fly high over Fenghuangcheng. There is also romantic music in the camp. Who is playing the jade flute with the feelings of ten thousand miles?" The second was titled "Reviewing Troops on the Expedition in Guangling," and the poem said: "The people are brave warriors and the horses are dragons. The orders are strict and the tea fire is respectful in the military camp. After the troop review is over, I return to camp in the evening, and my dreams revolve around the first peak of Wushan." The third was titled "Entering Yizhou," and the poem said: "Ten autumns have passed since the battle in Liaodong, and I am holding the banner of expedition to enter Yizhou again. How can the horses of the barbarians be allowed to drink the clear water of the Yalu River at the corner of Changbai Mountain?" Compared with the poems of the Tang people about the trumpets and flutes playing when leaving and entering the frontier, the momentum is profound and majestic, truly not inferior. How can only those scholars who are good at elegant songs and throwing arrows be considered to show the elegant demeanor of a Confucian general!</p>

<h3>Eastern European Front Remains Silent, Germany and the Soviet Union Prepare for Summer Decisive Battle, Soviet Army Fiercely Attacks Kuban Bridgehead Without Success, Pressure on German Army in Central Donets Also Relaxes</h3>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The German Führer Headquarters announced at noon on the 24th that there were only local battles on the Eastern Front.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The German and Soviet armies on the Eastern Front are now actively preparing for a summer offensive, but military experts believe that due to the climate and other natural conditions on the Eastern Front, the time to launch a large-scale operation may be slightly later than last year, but some also believe that the summer operation may start unexpectedly early. According to news from the German front lines, the Soviet army is currently concentrating a large number of infantry units and powerful tank units on the Moscow-south and Kursk front lines. The Soviet army failed to capture the Kuban bridgehead during the winter counter-offensive operation, and now before the German army begins its summer offensive, it has launched a fierce attack on the area again, but the result was ultimately unsuccessful. The Soviet army also seems to be desperately launching a fierce attack on the German army in the Orel area. In short, this year's summer offensive is the decisive period of this world war. Not only can it affect the overall war situation this year, but the war camp of the anti-Axis alliance will also inevitably suffer a major impact, so it is particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – News from Berlin said: The Eastern Front continues to be silent, and local Soviet attacks have been repelled by the German army. In the past 24 hours, the German Air Force has been extremely active, shooting down a total of 53 Soviet aircraft in the Eastern Front airspace. In the Crimea region, German fighter-bombers attacked Soviet railways, especially the Volzhsk and Kursk railway stations, which were heavily bombed, with many freight cars catching fire after being hit. Moscow Radio acknowledged that 10 Soviet fighters were shot down by the German side yesterday. It is reported that a group of German planes bravely broke through the encirclement of Soviet fighters and flew to the Kursk railway center, dropping bombs on various targets in the city. Ten Soviet planes were shot down in the ensuing battle.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Officials here said that the silence of the fighting on the Eastern Front is a "breathing" period before the decisive battle. The entire front was very silent on Saturday, but now there are local reconnaissance and attack units active to break the silence. Heavy rain in the central region prevents large-scale operations, but the German Air Force is very active, bombing Soviet troops engaged in deployment in the Volzhsk and Kursk regions. The Soviet army, which was carrying out operations in the southern battlefield and central region, was scattered by German bombers, and the Soviet army's pressure on the German positions on the hills near Lisichansk in the central Donets region has gradually eased. Military circles believe that if the Soviet army attacks, the combat zone seems to be the Crimea, Temryuk, or Novorossiysk.</p>
<h3>British Planes Attack Western Germany, Losing a Total of 38 Aircraft, Germany Also Bombs British Ports and Shipyards</h3>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The German Führer Headquarters announced this afternoon's war report on the Western Front: (1) The anti-Axis air force raided Dortmund in the Ruhr area on the night of the 23rd, dropping a large number of bombs and incendiary bombs, causing considerable damage to residents. (2) A German rapid fighter-bomber squadron launched a surprise attack on various ports in southern England, such as Plymouth and Hastings, during the day. (3) The German Air Force launched another large-scale air raid on the shipyards in Chatham, England, on the night of the 22nd. The city and port facilities were hit and caught fire.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to a telegram from London, the British Air Force Department announced on the 24th that when British planes raided western Germany on the evening of the 23rd, Britain lost 38 bombers. It also said that German planes bombed cities on the northeast coast of Britain on the evening of the 23rd, causing considerable damage in various places.</p>
<h3>One Japanese Hospital Ship Attacked Again by Enemy Planes</h3>
<p>Yangon, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – At 10:30 am on the 22nd, a Japanese hospital ship was sailing near the mouth of the Yangon River when it was suddenly attacked by seven enemy planes. Three of them machine-gunned the ship and then flew south. The details of the damage are still unclear. The enemy army has carried out such brutal acts against Japanese hospital ships ten times since the beginning of this year, attacking a total of eight ships. The Japanese soldiers and officers are all extremely indignant about this.</p>
<h3>Commander of Yokosuka Naval District, Admiral Toyoda Soemu, Takes Office</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to a telegram from Yokosuka, the newly appointed Commander of the Yokosuka Naval District, Admiral Toyoda Soemu, arrived in Yokosuka at 10 am on the 24th to take office.</p>

<h3>Air Supremacy and Naval Warfare (3)</h3>
<p>– Sato Kiichiro, translated from "Kaizo" May issue</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>The Battle of Stiletto in the Mediterranean in July of the same year was also an example of a triumphant song of seizing sea power from the air. On the 7th of the same month, the British fleet that departed from Alexandria Port was attacked by Italian bomber squads heading for coastal airfields and was bombed ten times throughout the 8th. On the other hand, the British fleet that departed from Gibraltar Port was repeatedly bombed for a day on the 9th by Italian bomber squadrons taking off from Sicily, and the cruiser "Poot" and the aircraft carrier "Ark Royal" were damaged and hurriedly sailed back to Gibraltar Port, revealing an ugly sight. Next, from the 10th to the 13th, the Alexandria fleet was bombed 40 times by Italian aircraft from Libya and the Dodecanese Islands, suffering heavy damage.</p>
<p>However, in the Battle of Cape Matapan in November of the same year, the roles were reversed, and the Italian Navy was at an extremely disadvantageous position against the British Air Force. The Italian fleet, which attempted to conduct operations on the island of Corfu, gathered in Cape Matapan Bay on the 11th of the same month. The British fleet noticed this and secretly lined up the main force of the fleet at the entrance of Cape Matapan Bay on the same night, attacking with the entire fleet and aircraft two hours before the Italian fleet exited. A total of about 100 bombers and fighter planes participated in the attack. The damage to the Italian fleet was announced as the battleship "Gaul" sunk, two battleships of the "Littorio" class, and two cruisers damaged.</p>
<p>In addition, in the Mediterranean, there were the Battle of Genoa in February of the same year and the Battle of Cape Matapan in March. All left inglorious battle records for the Italian Navy.</p>
<p>When discussing the convenience of air supremacy, it is necessary to mention the attack of aircraft on transport convoys protected by warships. Transport ships now also have considerable armed equipment. According to a certain foreign newspaper, the air defense firepower table for merchant ships is as follows (assuming five warships protect 15 merchant ships):</p>
<p>Total Armaments – Per Merchant Ship (Number of Shots Per Minute)</p>
<p>Anti-Aircraft Guns – Anti-Aircraft Machine Guns – Anti-Aircraft Guns – Anti-Aircraft Machine Guns</p>
<p>Transport Ship – 15-30 – 15-30 – 300-600 – 4500-9000</p>
<p>Escorting Warship – 10-15 – 20-40 – 200-300 – 6000-12000</p>
<p>Total – 25-75 – 35-70 – 500-900 – 10500-21000</p>
<p>However, transport ships have always been a disorganized rabble gathered together in an emergency, with light drafts and loads. Therefore, as shown in the table above, although there are armaments, it is very difficult to effectively and appropriately concentrate all firepower on enemy aircraft. From the aircraft's perspective, for example, the German Air Force's initial tactic was to use Messerschmitt -. class heavy machines to attack the guard, reducing combat power, and covering the bomber's attack on the transport ship. The first bomb in a transport ship scatters in all directions, and if it is bombed again, it will suffer a fatal blow. This is a very common situation. Attacking escorted merchant ships is the easiest operation for aircraft, but if the location is near an enemy air base, in other words, within the enemy's air supremacy zone, it is also difficult to approach, which is natural.</p>
<p>As the previous examples show, when a naval battle is decisive, it is necessary to have the advantage of air power, and gaining air supremacy is a prerequisite. Especially for battles within the operating radius of land-based bases, it is most desirable, but the danger of entering the enemy's air supremacy zone without air power is also very clear, as evidenced by the British Navy's failure in the first Norwegian operation.</p>
<p>Regarding the activities of the Japanese air force in the Greater East Asia War, there is no need to say more. How do aircraft dominate the naval warfare situation? This is deeply imprinted in the reader's mind by the publication of the Japanese General Headquarters' reports on the sea battles of Hawaii, the Strait of Malacca, and the recent South Pacific.</p>
<p>The presence or absence of air supremacy determines the naval warfare situation. This is at least a truth in the nature of modern warfare. (End) Translated by Xiao</p>
<h3>Navy Soul (1) - Turret Crewman</h3>
<p>– Nakamura Kenichi</p>
<p>It was not midnight, nor was it dawn, but the sky was slightly brighter than the sea. It was difficult to tell whether it was a sunny day or a cloudy day. The long light before dawn was still quite early before the general wake-up time, but the turret crewman, already wearing white work clothes and a hat, quietly approached the turret without making a sound, pushed open the heavy door, and disappeared inside. Not long after, he emerged from the gun's elevation angle and began to walk down again. Suddenly, all the turrets had already begun intense spontaneous exercises before the wake-up call. He discovered a soldier who had offered the traditional headscarf in front of the warship's deity the night before, but was single-mindedly praying under the dim light. This black steel floating city on the water, possessing all modern equipment, seemed to be only carrying these main guns. Every sail of a fishing boat could not escape his sight. They were actively practicing targeting such things. Turret and turret were competing desperately. First-line ships and second-line ships, squadrons and squadrons, fleets and fleets, were all competing desperately. And in this intense training, the shells that were particularly imbued with sound and color would surely hit British and American warships. Other than Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday mornings, noon, and evenings, when others were still dreaming, he still had some free time (Tao: Translated from Asahi Shimbun).</p>

<h3>Concern for North China Disaster Victims, All Sectors Respond to Disaster Relief, Wuxi Native Place Association Starts Fundraising, Mr. Chen Bohang Charity Sells Collected Calligraphy Twice</h3>
<p>Since the authorities advocated for the relief of the North China disaster, individuals and organizations have responded enthusiastically. Given the urgency of the situation, there are concerns that it may be too late. Although donations received by this newspaper on behalf of the victims are very enthusiastic, the amount is still insufficient. At this time of seasonal food shortage, the North China disaster victims are crying out for food and need to be dealt with promptly to save them from their immediate crisis. The gentry and merchants of Shanghai have always been public-spirited and helpful, and the authorities have placed special expectations on them. Please donate generously so that the effort can be completed.</p>
<h3>Charity Sale of Kaihuang Lanting, Minimum Price 50,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>This newspaper received a letter yesterday from the owner of Shimo Building, which said: "This unprecedented disaster in North China has caused the victims to suffer terribly, as reported in various newspapers. The people of Southeast China, based on the principle of mutual assistance, should do their best. In addition to the charity sale of the Kaicheng Stone Classics, I will now sell the domestic solitary copy of the Kaihuang Lanting, a treasure passed down in my family. The Lanting rubbings are known all over the world as the Dingwu version. I don't know that the Dingwu version belongs to the Ou Lin version. There are only two versions of the inscription on stone with Wang Xizhi's calligraphy, the 13th and 18th years of Kaihuang. Unfortunately, the original stone has been lost for a long time, and the rubbings are as rare as stars. All the fakes seen outside are fakes. My version has inscriptions and seals by famous people such as Du Yuanjing, Yao Gongshou, Cha Mouhe, Xiang Zijing, An Yizhou, Wang Liangchang, Da Jiangshang, Wang Menglou, Lu Shaojing, Yang Longshi, Wu Pingzhai, Zhu Guwei, Hui Nongran, Yu Shaosong, and others, with extremely precise evaluations and a clear lineage of transmission. It is by no means a reprint and has long been recognized by the art world. Many Chinese and foreign epigraphers have asked to buy it at high prices over the years, but I have refused to part with it because it is a treasure that is engraved in my heart. Now, for disaster relief, I plan to make it public to enthusiasts at a minimum price of 50,000 yuan. In addition to recovering two-fifths of the original cost, which is 20,000 yuan, the remainder will be used as disaster relief funds. It would be greatly welcomed if a Chinese person buys it; I would also be grateful for the friendship of foreign friends if they buy it at the stated price. Furthermore, what is the fixed price for a rare treasure? Even asking for a million would not be extravagant. Buyers today can easily obtain the finest goods at the lowest value and also save the most disaster victims. The merits are unparalleled and it is truly a great opportunity for those who have resources. Who is not as eager to do good as I am? I know that there will be those who will not be limited by the fixed price and will rise up to compete for it. Chen Bohang, owner of Shimo Building."</p>
<p>According to reports, Mr. Chen Bohang of Huaiyin, the owner of Shimo Building, is erudite and fond of antiquities. In the past, he edited a special publication on epigraphy, calligraphy, and painting in Hangzhou, and was well-known in the art world for a time. The genuine copy of Kaihuang Lanting collected by him is a rare treasure and is not easily shown to others. This time, he generously sells it for charity and disaster relief. Those who are willing to do good should not miss the opportunity.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Compatriots Are Extremely Concerned</h3>
<p>Regarding the disaster in North China, the Wuxi Shanghai Native Place Association is extremely concerned and convened a meeting of directors and supervisors on the 22nd of this month to decide to promptly issue donation books and receipts, and conduct fundraising separately as much as possible. Industrialist Mr. Wang Yuqing and calligrapher Mr. Qian Mingshan, and others have given sincere initiations and support. Their fundraising appeal said, "The provinces of North China have suffered from floods for years, and last year's locusts and droughts have caused severe disasters, as detailed in the newspapers. It is even more credible from the words of those who come from the disaster areas. It is said that the disaster area is as wide as nineteen counties, and the number of disaster victims is as high as tens of millions. Tree bark and grass roots have been dug up completely, and even snatching babies to eat to continue their lives and dividing corpses to fill their hunger. The cruelty of the situation is difficult to describe. I hope that the benevolent gentlemen of our county will expand their concern for their compatriots and act on the hearts of the hungry and drowning. At this time of seasonal food shortage, we will make a transition for them to ferry across so that the disaster victims who are gasping for breath can reach the other shore together." At the meeting, the authorities also received a letter from Mr. Qian Mingshan, which said, "The people of your county are public-spirited and helpful, and are always at the forefront of the counties in Jiangnan. This time, for the relief of North China, all factory owners and iron industrialists will surely agree. With this wind moving on the sea and moving the world, the disaster in Central China may have a turning point. Although I am not talented, if I have free time, I will prepare some joint fans and ask you to sell them on my behalf, to do my part."</p>
<h3>Aiding Recovery Through Skill Sharing</h3>
<p>This newspaper received a letter yesterday from Mr. Zhong Wenjun, stating, "According to fellow villagers who have fled famine to Shanghai, there has been a severe drought for ten months, with no grass or vegetation growing. Starving people are everywhere, dying one after another, a truly unbearable sight. I am originally from Yongnian County, Hebei Province, and have been a merchant in Shanghai for many years. I inherited the authentic teachings of Tai Chi Chuan from my maternal grandfather, Yang Chengfu. Now, I am willing to sacrifice my time and energy to teach it personally, without accepting any compensation, whether it is early or late. Firstly, it is to raise funds for the disaster in my hometown, and secondly, it is to fulfill my long-held ambition to promote physical education. If members of the community wish to learn this art, they can register through this newspaper to raise funds for relief efforts.

<h3>Ambassador Gu Completes Official Business, Flies Back to Post</h3>
<p>Mr. Gu Zhengzhi, the newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to China, arrived in Shanghai on the 21st. After conferring with various parties on important matters and exchanging greetings with military, civilian, and other circles upon assuming his post, he has now completed his official business. Ambassador Gu, along with his entourage including Minister Horiuchi, Counselor Ota, Secretary Shimizu, and Secretary Terashima, boarded a plane yesterday morning at 8:30 to fly to Beijing to return to his post.</p>
<h3>Hot Water Guild Demands Resumption of Selling Affordable Coal</h3>
<p>The city's 400+ hot water shops are currently facing operational difficulties due to their inability to purchase affordable coal. They have all requested assistance from the industry guild. The guild, considering the facts presented by its members, has found them to be true. In order to seek welfare for the industry, in addition to petitioning the Municipal Council's Guild Section to order coal merchants to supply and sell "affordable coal for hot water," they have now written to Da Zhong Lian Coal Company, urging them to resume the sale of affordable coal within a specified period to alleviate the urgent crisis. The guild pointed out that if the industry were to cease operations, it would cause various difficulties: (1) the livelihoods of tens of thousands of people in the city who depend on it would be abruptly cut off; (2) citizens would be unable to purchase hot water, causing inconvenience, and the general population would inevitably drink raw water to quench their thirst, leading to various dangerous illnesses; (3) citizens would burn water themselves, keeping their coal stoves burning day and night, easily causing accidents; (4) the working class, due to work constraints, would have no time to boil water, and even if they did, they would carelessly drink unclean raw water, which is a matter of hygiene. Furthermore, the industry, in order to maintain the livelihoods of ordinary people, has not increased the price of hot water. Currently, each ladle is still sold for one jiao in Central Reserve Bank notes, and the capacity of the ladle has also been increased to 1000 cc. Moreover, the industry is mostly operated on a small scale, and if this situation continues, they will be forced to close down. Therefore, members of the industry unanimously hope that the authorities and those who manage coal will resume the sale of "affordable coal for hot water" within a specified period, so that not only will citizens be able to conveniently purchase hot water nearby, but the industry will also be able to barely maintain its original state.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Southern Transportation Capacity, Adjusting Large Ships to Join the Voyage, Inland River Shipping Company Holds General Meeting Today</h3>
<p>According to news from the shipping industry, in order to adjust its shipping structure and enhance transportation capacity, the China Shipping Company, in addition to adding wooden boats to its fleet, recently plans to enhance its southern shipping capacity by adding large ships suitable for ocean navigation that are currently sailing elsewhere. The vacancies on other routes will be filled with wooden steamships and small steamers.</p>
<p>Operating Conditions of Inland River Shipping</p>
<p>The Shanghai Inland River Shipping Company authorities, in order to discuss future business strategies and report on last year's operating conditions, are scheduled to hold a general meeting today at the Japanese Club. According to the company's announcement, last year's business revenue was approximately 11,127,000 yuan, a slight increase compared to the previous year. However, due to increased expenditures last year, dividends for last year were suspended. In terms of revenue, 4,445,000 passengers were transported (1,660,000 in the first half of the year, totaling 1,240,000 yuan; 2,485,000 in the second half of the year, totaling 2,670,000 yuan). Freight totaled 4,155,000 yuan, with a total tonnage of 1,402,000 tons of cargo transported, generating 7,820,000 yuan in revenue (782,000 tons in the first half of the year, totaling 3,980,000 yuan; 630,000 tons in the second half of the year, totaling 3,840,000 yuan).</p>
<h3>Rumor That Deping Steamer Will Directly Serve Shanghai-Ningbo Route</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai-Ningbo route resumed service last year, travel between the two cities has been quite convenient for residents. However, although there are currently four steamers, Xin Ning Shao, Changshan, Hualin, and Wansheng, operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, due to the large number of passengers traveling back and forth, every trip is still fully booked. As a result, purchasing tickets has become inconvenient. According to a reliable source from the Datong News Agency, the Deping steamer, which previously operated on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, may soon be approved by the relevant authorities to resume direct service. At the same time, the price of tickets will also be maintained at a fixed rate by the authorities, and any violations will be punished.</p>
<h3>Pang Bingxun's Surrender, Comfort Movement Initiated by Seamen's Party Branch, City Party Branch Sends Special Telegram of Condolences</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai) General Pang Bingxun, commander of the 24th Group Army and deputy commander of the Ji-Cha War Zone, surrendered with his troops on the 6th of this month to participate in the peace movement. The Shanghai Special City Party Branch, recognizing General Pang as a famous general of the Northwest, who resolutely surrendered in accordance with the National Government's order to cease fire and demobilize, setting an example for soldiers, sent a telegram of condolence to express their respect. The original text is as follows: "To General Pang Bingxun of Xinxiang, As General Commander, you defended Ji-Cha. Now, recognizing the shifting of people's hearts and the trend of public opinion, you bravely broke free from Chongqing's constraints and surrendered with your troops in accordance with the National Government's national policy, participating in the peace movement. In an instant, you turned swords into plowshares and transformed a defensive area into a land of prosperity. News reports your sincere statement on a cold day, vowing to firmly adhere to your beliefs under Chairman Wang's leadership, wholeheartedly revitalize China, and strive to defend East Asia. We read it again and again with increasing admiration. As the saying goes, 'Exhaust your strength and follow it with loyalty.' Is this not what the General is doing? We look up to the clouds and mountains with endless longing. We send this telegram of condolence and respectfully request your perusal. From Ling Xianwen, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party Shanghai Special City and all party members."</p>
<p>Condolence Measures</p>
<p>In order to comfort General Pang's army and show respect, the Seamen's Special Party Branch of this city has launched a comfort movement, with the Director of the Party Branch convening its members to actively prepare for the comfort of General Pang's army. In addition to sending a telegram of respect, they have also appointed a special person to organize a comfort delegation to General Pang's army. At the same time, they have launched a campaign to solicit comfort funds and collect various practical items, so that they can be gathered and transferred to General Pang's troops. The Party Branch has already solicited donations from relevant seamen's organizations and shipping companies.</p>
<h3>Third Phase of Household Sugar Sales Temporarily Suspended This Month</h3>
<p>According to information gathered by a Datong News Agency reporter, the third phase of household sugar sales in the city, originally scheduled for the 11th of this month, was postponed to this week due to delays in the distribution procedures. Now, due to pending consultations on the procedures, it is said that there is no hope of selling this phase of household sugar until at least the end of the month.</p>
<h3>Tram Monthly Season Ticket Prices to Increase Starting Next Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tram Company, for all trams and trolleybuses operating in the Public Concession, has set an increase in fares starting tomorrow (the 26th), as previously reported in this newspaper. According to information gathered by a Datong News Agency reporter, starting next month, the prices of tram monthly season tickets will also be adjusted. Adult first-class tickets will be 90 yuan per month (previously 66 yuan), third-class tickets will be 45 yuan (previously 33 yuan), and children's tickets (valid for both first-class and third-class carriages) will also be 45 yuan (previously 25 yuan).</p>
<h3>Manufacturing Soap, Candles, and Grease, No Restrictions on Transportation, Free Transportation Permitted to Shanghai Area</h3>
<p>In this city, in addition to the grease produced locally and the existing inventory, all industrial factories feel that the raw materials are insufficient and must be procured from within the jurisdiction of the Qingxiang Committee Shanghai Branch. According to the General Control Association, merchants are free to transport goods in and out of all areas within this city, including various regions, without the need to apply for permits. Therefore, the person in charge of the Shanghai Industrial Grease Industry Association petitioned the Municipal Economic Bureau, requesting them to separately request the Qingxiang Committee Shanghai Branch and the Municipal Police Bureau to order their subordinates to allow members of the Association who have procured goods within the Qingxiang area and have a certificate issued by the Association to pass freely, in order to meet the needs of soap and candle manufacturing factories. It is now learned that the Municipal Economic Bureau has issued a letter to the police, ordering them to allow free transportation without restrictions for industrial grease transported from within the area to the Shanghai area, as it is not included in the specific materials listed in Article 6, Paragraph 2 of the Provisional Regulations on the Restriction of Wartime Material Movement, in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of the Regulations.</p>
<h3>Madam Feng Muwen's Funeral, Funeral Gifts Converted into University Loan Funds</h3>
<p>Madam Wen, the mother of Mr. Feng Bingnan, declined condolences and all funeral gifts. Mr. Feng's friends, Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, and others, believed that customary exchanges were unavoidable, so they had a plan to convert the cash into social welfare projects. At the time, they published a notice and collected a certain amount, which, along with Mr. Feng Bingnan's donation of thanks, was used to donate to various charitable organizations, with the remainder used to establish a university loan fund, and organized a "Madam Feng Muwen University Loan Fund Committee" to be responsible for safekeeping. Now, on the 30th of this month, which is the date of Madam's funeral, Wen Lanting and others are launching another initiative, following the previous method, to convert it into cash to replenish the university loan fund, in order to fulfill Madam's will.</p>

<h3>Japanese Naval Exhibition Organized by the News Association Opens, Displaying Various Photos and Creating a Grand Spectacle, The Press Will Visit the Izumo Warship Today</h3>
<p>The "Japanese Naval Anniversary Exhibition," jointly organized by the Shanghai News Association and the Fine Arts Patriotic Association to commemorate the 38th Japanese Naval Festival Week, opened yesterday at the painting hall on the fourth floor of the Daxin Company on Nanjing Road. From morning to evening, there were no less than 10,000 visitors. This shows the general public's awareness of the Japanese Navy in this city. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Various Photos Displayed at the Venue</p>
<p>The venue is located at the painting hall on the fourth floor of Daxin, which is spacious, so there are a large number of items on display. At the entrance is a Japanese naval flag and a photo of the Japanese navy. The first photo on display is of Marshal Togo, who led the Japanese navy to defeat the powerful Russian fleet 38 years ago. There is also a portrait of Commander Yamamoto of the Combined Fleet, who commanded the overall operations in the South Pacific last month and died for his country. Next to it is a recent photo of Commander Koga, Yamamoto's successor. In the center of the painting hall is a large painted map of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Other photos include naval battle scenes from Hawaii, Malaya, the Indian Ocean, Surabaya, New Guinea, the Coral Sea, and the Solomon Islands. The spirit of the Japanese navy's heroic combat is evident on paper. Other photos depict the Marine Corps, the Air Corps, military schools, life on warships, the majesty of warships, the navy of the new China, and the Shanghai Ocean Youth Team, describing the situation of combat, introducing the content of training, showing the daily life and operations of naval personnel, and emphasizing the completeness of the equipment of the modern Japanese navy. There are also more than 100 works by Japanese schoolchildren, painted in color, depicting the lives of soldiers, which is enough to show the Japanese students' understanding of the navy. In addition, there are many patterns such as "Color of Seawater," "Ocean Depth," "Seawater Composition," and "Coral Reef."</p>
<p>Ship Models Are Realistic</p>
<p>In addition to photos, there are also more than ten evolutionary diagrams of ancient and modern warships, from wooden warships 4,000 years ago to modern warships. The evolution is clear at a glance. There are also various modern ship types, including sand boats, cargo ships, oil tankers, fishing boats, merchant ships, mail ships, and shallow-water boats, gathered together, creating a grand spectacle. Various warship patterns are also on display. Among the exhibits, the three-dimensional models of various ships and warships are carefully appreciated by the audience. They are realistic. The rest are ship models made by Japanese schoolchildren. The sizes vary, with ordinary ships being the most common and warships being the second most common. The larger ones are one or two inches, and the smaller ones are five or six feet. Many people are watching. Those who have never seen the true appearance of warships can learn a thing or two from this. In addition, the special issue of the News Association celebrating the Japanese Navy Anniversary Day is distributed at the venue. In addition to describing the achievements of the Japanese Navy and its traditional spirit, it also provides a general description of the work of the Association.</p>
<p>Today's Visit to the Izumo Flagship</p>
<p>In addition to the exhibition hosted by the News Association and the Fine Arts Patriotic Association, there are the following that opened the day before yesterday to commemorate Navy Day: (1) The commemorative exhibition at the Greater East Asia Cultural Reporting Center at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Jiangxi Road, displaying models of various warships and aircraft, war photos, statistical charts, and colorful comics. (2) The China Film United Company displayed various naval photos in the Grand Light and Dahua theaters. (3) The International Theater and the Shanghai Theater in Hongkou have naval military photo exhibitions hosted by the Allied Press, Asahi Shimbun, Mainichi Shimbun, Yomiuri Shimbun, and the Continental News. In addition, the News Association and the Japanese Naval Reporting Department have reached an agreement to invite reporters from various newspapers to visit the Izumo flagship at 3 pm today. They will gather at 2:40 pm on the third floor of the Fleet Reporting Department on the Bund and depart together. The Izumo warship made special contributions during the Russo-Japanese War and is now the residence of the fleet commander.</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Lessons from the North China Famine</h3>
<p>The ancients said, "After a great war, there will inevitably be a great epidemic." Fortunately, due to the advancement of modern medicine and thorough epidemic prevention, this saying is not true. The ancients also said, "After a great war, there will inevitably be a great famine." Given the prolonged war and the stalemate, this saying may unfortunately prove to be true. The recent famine in various provinces of North China, calling for the transport of grain from Central and Southern China for relief, is just one example of the unfortunate truth of the ancient saying. We trace the cause and, for the sake of humanity, sincerely call for the early arrival of a comprehensive, glorious peace in the country.</p>
<p>Other reasons for the current famine in North China are said to be (1) scarce rainfall, (2) hoarding of grain by the rich, (3) lack of external grain, (4) promotion of cotton fields, and (5) extensive cultivation of other unprofitable crops. The fundamental solution to scarce rainfall seems to be to plant forests extensively and dig more wells; the thorough solution to cracking down on the rich hoarding grain seems to be to check warehouses and search homes, but the latter is extremely disruptive and has many drawbacks; the proper solution to the lack of external grain is to exchange North China's mineral resources for Central China's agricultural products, and first to facilitate transportation and lift restrictions; as for the promotion of cotton fields, it is also aimed at solving the problem of clothing, so it is not entirely blameworthy. If it can be further developed to exchange North China's cotton for Central China's rice, that would be even better. As for the extensive cultivation of other unprofitable crops, we hope that the people of North China can learn from the pain and not seek short-term gains and forget long-term harms, and quickly change to planting profitable crops—grains and food—to avoid the recurrence of famine.</p>
<p>"The people regard food as their heaven." It was so in ancient times, it is so now, and when is it not so? On the day the famine demon strikes, people suddenly realize the suitability of the heavy agricultural policy. While we are talking about increasing production, please do not abandon the fundamentals and pursue the trivial!</p>
<h3>Economic Bureau Continues to Register Eight Major Commodities from June 1st to 30th</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Economic Bureau began the general registration of major items such as cotton, matches, soap, and candles on April 5th, and extended the deadline to the 10th of this month. The registration has been largely completed by the deadline. Now, the Ministry of Industry has issued a list of major commodities, which includes (1) wool fabrics and wool products, (2) cocoons, (3) silk and silk products, (4) industrial grease, (5) tobacco leaves, (6) glass (including raw materials and products), (7) electrical appliances (including raw materials and products), and (8) leather (including raw materials and products). Since these eight items were not included in the previous general registration, it has been decided to continue the registration of the above eight major commodities from June 1st to June 30th. It is hoped that those who store major items will comply with the regulations.</p>
<h3>The Commercial Control Association and the Ministries of Industry and Food Control Materials</h3>
<p>After the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association, the control of materials within the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai has been greatly relaxed compared to the past. However, in addition to the controlled materials stipulated by the Materials Control Review Committee of the Association, there are also controlled materials stipulated by the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Food. The following is a list of the 37 controlled materials stipulated by the Commercial Control Association, the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Food:</p>
<p>Commercial Control Association</p>
<p>The controlled materials determined by the Materials Control Review Committee were originally eleven items, but four more items have been added recently, totaling fifteen items: (1) wheat (2) flour (3) miscellaneous grains (4) oil raw materials (5) cotton yarn and cotton cloth (6) livestock (7) soap (8) candles (9) matches (10) sugar (11) tobacco leaves (12) cotton (13) hemp and its products (14) wool (15) leather.</p>
<p>Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>The controlled materials determined by the Ministry of Industry total eighteen items: (1) cotton (2) cotton yarn (3) cotton fabrics (4) chemical industrial products (including raw materials, western medicine, pigments, dyes, and alcohol) (5) wool fabrics and wool products (6) cocoons (7) silk and silk fabrics (8) industrial grease (9) candles (10) soap (11) matches (12) coal and coal briquettes (13) tobacco leaves and cigarettes (14) rubber raw materials and products (15) hardware (including iron, steel, tinplate, metal raw materials and products) (16) glass raw materials and products (17) electrical appliance raw materials and products (18) leather raw materials and products</p>
<p>Ministry of Food</p>
<p>The controlled materials determined by the Ministry of Food total six items: (1) flour (2) miscellaneous grains (including wheat, buckwheat, barley, corn, peanuts, soybeans, broad beans) (3) livestock (including cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, ducks, lard) (4) chicken and duck eggs (5) sugar (6) edible oil (including raw oil, rapeseed oil, cottonseed oil).</p>
<h3>The Materials Control Review Committee Holds Its Third Meeting</h3>
<p>The Materials Control Review Committee has held two committee meetings in Nanjing and Shanghai. Tomorrow at 3 pm, the third committee meeting will be held at the International Club. All members of the committee will go to Nanjing to attend.</p>
<h3>The Wheat and Flour Professional Committee Will Send Personnel to Purchase Wheat</h3>
<p>After the National Commercial Control Association's Wheat and Flour Professional Committee was formally established on the 20th of this month, its internal organizational structure has been completely determined. It is divided into eight departments and twenty-one sections, responsible for the purchase of wheat, the distribution and sale of flour bran, the adjustment of prices, the inspection of quality, the increase and improvement of production, and other matters. It will also establish branches in nine major wheat and flour production and sales areas, including Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Taizhou, Nanjing, Wuhu, and Bengbu, in order to strengthen purchasing and manufacturing work. It is reported that the committee will send personnel from the wheat section and the review section to the wheat production areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces this week to investigate the production status, the flour production of Chinese and Japanese factories, the quantity of wheat raw materials needed, and the amount of flour produced, in order to provide a basis for the purchase of wheat and the distribution to the industry. At the same time, the wheat section and the flour bran section will prepare to carry out the first step of wheat purchase work based on the results of the investigation, in order to allocate it to flour mills to produce flour to meet the needs of the people.</p>
<h3>Bank of Communications Plans to Establish Agricultural Warehouses</h3>
<p>The Agricultural Economics Department of the Bank of Communications has decided on a new agricultural loan plan and has already begun implementing this business. This plan will have a significant impact on all parties. According to the bank's Economic Department, a certain agricultural implement manufacturer intends to apply for a loan of 10 million yuan, and a certain agricultural farm intends to apply for a loan of 200,000 yuan. The strengthening and addition of cooperative societies and agricultural warehouses are currently under study. The issue of cooperative societies has already been reported in the press. Regarding the establishment of agricultural warehouses, which are closely related to cooperative societies, there are many difficulties due to materials and funds. Although there is a desire to repair temples or civilian houses in various towns and turn them into small and medium-sized warehouses, this is not an easy task. As a result, Bank of Communications Chairman Tang Shoumin and the authorities of the Ministry of Food must negotiate and proceed. The bank's agricultural product guarantees and the current food purchase policy of the Ministry of Food must not conflict. Therefore, the Ministry of Food's entrustment of the Bank of Communications to handle part of the food purchase matters is quite problematic. Regarding the agricultural loan issue, according to the bank's Agricultural Economics Department:</p>
<p>As far as we know, the organization of the loan syndicate has not yet been finalized. It is also possible that Mr. Tang has already conducted concrete negotiations with other powerful banks. Our department is currently rushing to formulate our bank's agricultural loan business policy. Regarding the issue of agricultural warehouses, there have been significant changes in all aspects, such as the price of agricultural products in warehouses and interest rates, before and after the incident. Moreover, the Ministry of Food has issued food warehouse bonds to purchase rice. Therefore, the opening of agricultural warehouses must be done with the full understanding of the Ministry of Food. The above is a general principle. In short, the warehouse issue has not yet been finalized. The agricultural loan business can only be soundly promoted after our department's plan is fully in place. (Yun Peng: Translated from the May 24th "Continental News")</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Industry Forms a Subcommittee to Review Accepted Discounted Bills</h3>
<p>Various banks and businesses in the silver and money industry have established a bill acceptance and discount implementation plan through the Banking Association to promote commercial acceptance bills. This has been submitted to the Bankers' Association for review. A subcommittee has been formed for detailed review. It is said that the Silver and Money Association has already sent letters to various businesses to conduct research.</p>
<h3>Trend of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese agricultural stocks initially stabilized and strengthened. However, the price of gold has plummeted, and the money market is becoming increasingly tight, leading to a rapid return to a dismal and sluggish decline. In the rush to sell for cash, various stocks were particularly weak at noon. However, there were exceptions, such as China Weaving, Maorong, Jingfu Socks Factory, and Tongyi Trust Company. Among the old stocks, China Underwear suddenly became the target of new and old investors. The market was active, and prices also moved upward, probably due to the firm rise in shirts and other goods. Wing On Company and China National Goods were in continuous ups and downs. Sincere Company stood alone at the pass. China Silk Factory, Wing On Textiles, and other small-denomination textile stocks such as Guoguang Printing and Dyeing were not inquired about, and prices stepped lower in the selling pressure. Among the new pharmaceutical companies, Sino-French Pharmacy and New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory saw buyers after small price declines, and stabilized at noon, with slight short covering. Zhabei Water and Electricity, China Merchants Electric, and Nanyang Tobacco Company, as well as stocks such as Great China Match Company, remained unchanged from last Saturday. In the cultural industry, China and World Book Company remained flat. Commercial Press lacked buyers and declined sharply. Jiu'an Industrial stabilized. China United Film and Xinyi Real Estate prices were weak and no one could match China Clock Factory, which had no buyers and a huge drop.</p>
<h3>Economic Bureau Approves the Formation of the Secondhand Goods Trade Association</h3>
<p>Since the city's Secondhand Goods Trade Association was approved by the Municipal Economic Bureau, Guo Yanting has actively begun preparations and investigations. In the autumn of material scarcity after the incident, the secondhand goods industry has been particularly prosperous because it suits the purchasing power of the common people. However, the industry has always lacked consistent business methods, leading unscrupulous individuals to often use the name of secondhand goods to conspire to exploit the interests of the common people, which is criticized by society. To effectively rectify the industry, the association will issue various regulations to the industry for unified compliance as soon as the formal establishment is completed.</p>

<h3>On the Cotton Cloth Problem (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Li Zhihua</p>
<p>(4) According to the regulations in Article 3, since the fate of all registered goods has been decided by the association, future transactions will definitely not exceed the price limit. Under the principle of not exceeding the price limit, warehouse receipts should also be allowed to be freely traded, so as to smooth the finances between manufacturers and wholesalers. However, the maximum amount of inventory that each cotton cloth merchant can hold must be specified to avoid suspicion of hoarding. According to the above measures, the black market transactions of manufacturers and wholesalers can be reduced. However, whether the retail price of retail stores can avoid the black market depends on the amount of allocation. If the amount of cotton cloth inventory statistically calculated by the authorities is sufficient to meet the needs of the year, then the amount of allocation will naturally not be too small, and the black market will not occur. Conversely, there is only one method of distributing cloth according to the population. Otherwise, the result will be just like the past squeezing of oil, squeezing of sugar, and even the recent squeezing of cigarettes, which will not bring any real benefit to the people and will only cause more disputes.</p>
<p>In short, in this wartime, it is inevitable that prices will rise due to the difficulty of tightening currency. However, if the authorities carefully consider the overall plan, it is not difficult to achieve better results. (End)</p>
<p>Popular Life: The Petty Employee of the Salaried Class, Use One</p>
<p>In today's world of soaring prices, the wealthy are certainly unaffected, but ordinary people are all complaining. Especially us petty employees of the salaried class, besides burying ourselves in work all day, even shedding blood and sweat, we also have to endure the lessons of our superiors. And what we eat every day is only coarse food and light meals, which we sometimes cannot swallow. What we get every month is only the price of eighty or ninety yuan. Ask the reader, where can this money be used to support the old and the young in the family? It is even difficult to maintain personal expenses. It almost makes our lives breathless. For example, the cost of haircuts and baths in a month is about 20 yuan. A pair of cotton socks also costs seventeen or eighteen yuan. In addition, the cost of cigarettes is at least thirty or forty yuan. Leaving aside other things, just taking the above items, it already amounts to seventy or eighty yuan, so how much money is left over! If you want to buy a pair of shoes, even the most economical tire-soled shoes, you have to save for four or five months. Making clothes is even out of the question. Although we often hear that we are going to get a raise, we feel as happy as if we have been injected with a stimulant, but in the end it cannot become a reality. It is really what is called: "Only hear the sound of the elevator, but do not see anyone coming down." This makes us greatly disappointed. Sometimes, if a colleague happens to be sick, or if there is an urgent need at home, we have to discuss borrowing some money from the authorities, and the procedures are really extremely troublesome. First, you have to fill out an application form, stating the reasons, seeking proper guarantees, and then you have to get the approval of the superiors before you can get what you want. Sometimes you may even be rejected, which is also uncertain. On the other hand, what about their lives? Besides the social engagements in transactions, they spend their days in the world of red lanterns and green wine, living a life of drunkenness and death. Although they do not have cars to travel in and out, at least they use rickshaws. In winter, they turn on water heaters and electric furnaces at home, and in summer, they turn on electric fans. What they eat every day is either delicacies from the mountains or seafood. When they need money, they just need a check to ask the cashier to pay. If you use the two sentences "Work hard without earning money, hate money without working hard" here, it is more appropriate. In short, in today's society, the general salaried class feels the hardship of maintaining a livelihood. In the long run, it is enough to affect the efforts of their own work and the security of the local area. Now I have written some simple things to make an urgent appeal to people in the society and local authorities, hoping to give us powerful assistance!</p>

<p>Special Edition for Mr. Shen Xinqing's Eightieth Birthday</p>
<h3>Mr. Shen Xinqing's Eightieth Birthday</h3>
<p>— Respectfully written by Jiang Weiqiao of Wujin</p>
<p>Since ancient times, virtuous and wise men have had firm and steadfast aspirations within them. Externally, they have had few desires. They have preserved their original nature, like uncarved jade. They are accustomed to hard work, like a door hinge that is not infested with worms. Such people can often reach the age of eighty or ninety and their minds do not decline. Is Mr. Shen Xinqing of Wuxian not a virtuous and wise man? Mr. Shen was young and honest. His learning was based on using the classics to serve the world. He was especially good at exegesis. His calligraphy entered Wang's style from Yan and Liu. His poetry approached Li and Du. At the age of fifteen, he supplemented the doctoral student member. He raised in the township in the Jiawu year. After the Wuxu year, the domestic pioneers realized that my country was weak. Foreign troubles occurred frequently. There was no way to survive without reform and development of education. Although Mr. Shen was successful in the township siege, he had no intention of becoming an official. He devoted himself to education. When Qing Yan issued an edict to study, he proposed to change the Longmen Academy, where he had been studying in the past, into a normal school. He was appointed as the first supervisor. The students were polite and lectured on the classics. Within a few years, the results were remarkable. The provinces heard the news and imitated him, for fear of being left behind. When the national system changed in the Xinhai year, Mr. Shen believed that the people should do their duty to rejuvenate the Republic of China. He then entered the Jiangsu Governor's Office and was in charge of civil affairs. He carefully selected the shepherds and cleaned up the officialdom. After the outbreak of the war, all the schools in the province stopped. Mr. Shen worked hard to recover and reorganize them. The public and private schools in the province and county heard the sound of string music again. After the reorganization of the Governor's Office, Mr. Shen retired and presided over the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association. At that time, educational theories in Eastern and Western countries were changing rapidly. He selected the ones that conformed to my country's national conditions. He gathered members to study them. If the research was successful, he would offer it to the authorities, hoping to implement it in practice. He opened a lecture to publicize it to the academic community. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Shen and his comrades advocated vocational education. Later, it became the Chinese Vocational Education Society. Mr. Shen painstakingly lectured everywhere. He encouraged young people to respect their careers and enjoy group work. He made it the purpose of education to enable the unemployed to have a job and the employed to enjoy their work. The sound of vocational education spread throughout the country. In the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, he and several friends created the Jiazi Society. He collected modern historical materials and widely reported in chapters and magazines. All the court regulations, criminal laws, rites and music, water conservancy, farmland, and social customs were divided into parts and added with pruning. The toothpicks were ten thousand axes, like a net in the outline. It was expanded into a humanities library. Mr. Ye Hongying saw it and felt it was good. He generously donated funds. It was renamed the Hongying Library. Mr. Shen has been in charge of the library for nearly 20 years. He goes to the library every day, even in wind and rain. Although his hearing and gait have weakened slightly recently, his spirit is still vibrant. He still supports the public with a cane. Many people who love Mr. Shen advise him to rest, but Mr. Shen firmly ignores it. Mr. Shen's heart for loving the country and saving the world is getting stronger as he gets older. Recently, he felt sorry for the world and the people, and re-established the Rongwu Lecture Sutra Friendship Society. He intended to reconcile the various religions and promote the Great Harmony. He praised Confucianism and hoped to practice it. How great is his wish. Today, Mr. Shen is eighty years old. June 1st is the day of the award. His friends know that Mr. Shen never celebrates his birthday and that his words and deeds are worthy of being recorded. He entrusted me to write the preface. I think that Mr. Shen can achieve great age and his mind does not decline. One word of diligence is enough to describe it. The Book of Changes says that the sky moves vigorously. A gentleman strives for self-improvement. The legend says that people live in diligence. Diligence is not poor. This is what it means. It is written at the end of the article so that future generations will know what to emulate.</p>
<h3>What I Know About Mr. Shen Xinqing</h3>
<p>— Pan Yangyao</p>
<p>Mr. Xinqing's actions in his life are often encouraged by the two words "not sloppy." When he was in charge of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association, when processing official documents, even if there was a mistake in one word, he had to correct it before it was over, and he tried his best to prevent the clerks from being sloppy. He always said that once the pen and ink were sloppy, he would know that the person was rough and playful in doing things, and there was nothing to be taken! Therefore, those who have worked in Mr. Shen's office must be careful and meticulous, and their movements must be in accordance with the law, that is, they know that they have benefited from Guang Sheng's example and have been well trained.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen usually devotes himself to lecturing, especially the two books of the University Book of Changes, and he has a unique understanding of their meaning. "The sky is healthy, and a gentleman strives for self-improvement." Mr. Shen often urges his students to deeply appreciate this sentence, and he especially admires Confucius' spirit of "knowing that it is impossible and doing it," which is the most worthy of being an example. Mr. Shen once thought of the sentence "A gentleman is self-satisfied without anyone," which shows that Chuan Da is generous and happy. His cultivation skills are all derived from this taste, which is the sign of Mr. Shen's longevity.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen's learning is guided by simplicity and usefulness. Therefore, in the sixth year of the Republic of China, he and the educational leaders in the north and south of the Yangtze River created and led vocational education, established a society to promote it, and lectured back and forth. They must use "professionalism" and "enjoyment" as encouragement to "enable the unemployed to have a job and the employed to enjoy their work," which is also the goal of Mr. Shen's lifelong education. At that time, the company's Ding Company Zheng was decided by Mr. Shen; Mr. Shen Gu Wei Ren Zhi Mr. said: "From now on, it will be the era of the omnipotence of both hands, can you use both hands as a sign?" His worship of practical learning can be seen in his deep intentions. Mr. Shen has been in charge of various agencies, strict between taking and giving, holding the purpose of open accounting, the most strict in the accounts, even the slightest amount, he is not willing to be sloppy, the so-called not taking a penny, not giving a penny to others, Mr. Shen has it.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen encouraged his students with meticulous care. Seeing that young people have a good point, he must praise it without decline, and induce them to strive forward. There are not a few young people who have worked hard to improve themselves because of encouragement. However, he hates evil as an enemy throughout his life, and does not hide it at all. Seeing that people's words and deeds are absurd, he must rebuke them face to face, and he is not willing to follow anything, so there are inevitably afterwords at that time; but after a long time, the person wakes up and turns to gratitude, thinking that Mr. Shen is indeed worthy of being a friend and a strict teacher!</p>
<p>Mr. Shen's morality and articles have been praised by the world, and his calligraphy is especially vigorous and magnificent, and people are eager to treasure it. However, he is not willing to follow people's requests casually, does not write on inferior paper, does not write on folding fans, and does not write on those who despise him. It is recorded that an old friend asked him to write a fan for more than ten years, and finally did not get Mr. Shen's permission. This kind of strong and resolute spirit can also see Mr. Shen's perseverance.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Republic of China, after resigning from the post of the Su Civil Affairs Department, Mr. Shen has vowed to serve the society and has no intention of politics. During the Li Huangpi era, he admired Mr. Shen's name and appointed him as the director of the Xiang Education Department. Mr. Shen firmly declined the offer. In the resignation, he wished to make contributions as a commoner in the wild, and his temperament was indifferent, which can be seen here.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen's observations on the current situation and everything are full of optimism. Looking at the world and thinking about the future, he is never pessimistic. His discussions and poems all contain the spirit of actively moving forward. I still remember that when the Family Day Renewal Society held a meeting in the past, I accompanied my father to the meeting. I talked with Mr. Shen for a long time. Mr. Shen Gu Wei said to me: "Your father has a broad mind and has the atmosphere of spring everywhere, which is gratifying." My father, the eldest son, passed away unfortunately due to a rock disease two years ago. Every time I think of this, I am saddened.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen's poetry is deeply rooted and directly pursues the charm of the Tang Dynasty. For more than 20 years, every time I meet Mr. Shen, I must show his recent works to me, or hand-copy a piece of paper and give it to me, so there are many treasures in the old box, which is even more precious. When I traveled south in the past, I must get a handwritten letter from Mr. Shen every month, and he must give me a new poem in the letter, which is very sincere. You Qiao Ma Xiangbo Mr. lived in Tushan Bay, Mr. Shen initiated the Qianling Collection, and whenever Xiang Lao's birthday, he would go to his residence to make a literary and wine party, famous people gathered, Mr. Shen improvised a poem, and there were many who agreed. In a certain year, on the occasion of the 100th birthday of Xiang Lao, Mr. Shen mailed a letter to Yue, wrote a hundred-rhyme poem to wish him, beautiful and neat. Now that Xiang Lao has returned to the mountains, most of the predecessors who participated in the meeting at that time have also dissipated, and when I think back to that time, I am overwhelmed. However, the Qianling Collection was printed into a book by my teacher Lu Guiliang, in order to keep the Hongxue.</p>
<h3>Shou翁's Calligraphy</h3>
<h3>Xin Lao has been my friend for more than 560 years. On the occasion of his 80th birthday, I will write a long song and pray for the improvement of the political situation.</h3>
<p>— Lu Guiliang</p>
<p>I am worried about the difficulties of the times when I am worried about the desolation. I cannot save the suffering of the world. I am happy that I am worth the strange disaster that broke the ground. In the near future, I can climb the spring platform of He Xihao together. Shen Lao was born after Hong Yang. The family of literature has a good foundation. The thorn courtyard's great works are brilliant in the south. The bull's ears of the literary world hold the right. In the Jiawu year, he went to the public car to express his grief. He generously presented a letter of obedience. Jia Sheng's exclamation was boiling, and he was exempted from reporting. He sighed in the grass in the hospital. Our China first created the Republic of China. The Asian countries are proud of it. The abolition of the old and the new is a matter of all kinds. You participate in it and praise it diligently. Hong Tao's dream of being an emperor was lost for a hundred days. The crowd blindly encouraged the progress of the table to compete for the mention. You and your comrades resisted the fly electricity. The middle stream protects the whale. He diligently lectured in the sound of national crisis. People say that this old man is really strong. I am used to deducing poetry. Ba Cai is the first hero in poetry. (When you were young, your body was short, your skin was white and bright, and Zhu Jun Zihao, a classmate of the Longmen Academy, called you Qi Xiaobai. Now, most people under middle age do not know it.) Hei Qiao Xiang Gong's injustice is not white. (After you were seventy years old, your hair was not white. One day, during the banquet, you suspected that I said that you had the injustice of not being white. The whole seat burst into laughter.) The joke is not skin-deep, and the laughter is high. I have known them for fifty or sixty years. I pour out my writing when I am in high spirits. I will give you a word of opening nine. I will sing nine as a wish. What's more, the world's fortune is difficult to turn around. At the banquet, I will promote you. The frowns are suddenly stretched out, and we will share the Ning. Worry and happiness are originally related to the world.</p>
<h3>Celebrating the Eightieth Birthday of My Father-in-law, Mr. Shen Xinqing</h3>
<p>— Jia Fengzhen</p>
<p>I have followed you for forty years. Every time I miss the past, I am very happy.</p>
<p>You are a bear and a tiger in your dreams. I am ashamed of being a chicken and a dog fairy.</p>
<p>Kuang Ding's fame is due to sparseness. (Zhang Zengzhen should not take the ministerial examination or become an official.)</p>
<p>Cao Can's career relies on salary transmission. (Zhen Longmen follows the old rules.)</p>
<p>His spirit is soaring to the sky. It is also a predestined relationship to bow your head when you see it.</p>
<p>The years are changing in the shade of the trees. It is like a fly attached to a foal.</p>
<p>The government opened up to participate in the new China. (In the new creation of the Republic of China, Li Tong was the Director of Civil Affairs of Jiangsu. Zhen once served as the Secretary of the Shanghai Resident of Su.)</p>
<p>The teaching of righteousness was accompanied by the ancient Beijing. (In the Xinhai year of the Emperor Xuantong, Zhen followed Zhang to Yanjing to attend the meeting of the Central Education Association of the Ministry of Education.)</p>
<p>The Dragon and Tiger Wind and Cloud sneered at the persuasion of progress. Asia and Europe resisted the alliance. (Resisting Hongxian did not join the Alliance, which Zhen strongly advocated, and Zhang praised and approved it.)</p>
<p>I don't think about following the trend, but I think about saving the country. I have won the name of the leader of the school. (The name of the school leader is listed with Zhang and Zhen. According to the English school leader, that is, an educator, Zhen is really not qualified.)</p>
<p>The quality is the same as that of Pu Liu Wang Qiu Ling. Fortunately, the eyes are always blue.</p>
<p>Admire the strange texts when you are young. Washing the beautiful sentences is also a good age.</p>
<p>Feiran educated three thousand sons. Indeed, the spirit is two hundred bottles. (Zhang's treasured objects)</p>
<p>The five religions have the same origin and respect Confucius alone. The old man stars in the Taiwan and Lai groups.</p>
<p>The white-haired knows each other and is still sincere. Confucius and Yan are happy to be in poverty.</p>
<p>Xie Lan has a good fortune to spare. Zhang is planting trees in Jiang Yun and cherishes the old people.</p>
<p>The time is more than three immortals and Buddhas. The books are the relatives of ten thousand volumes of saints and sages.</p>
<p>I often hear the five songs of Jiu Ru. I look forward to seeing the rare treasures when the time comes.</p>
<h3>What I Know About Mr. Shen Xinqing</h3>
<p>— Bai Jiao</p>
<p>One morning in the early summer of the 18th year of the Republic of China, I met Mr. Shen Xinqing for the first time at the Humanities Library in Xiaotaoyuan Lane through the introduction of Huang Ren Lao. "Serious and strong" was his first impression of me.</p>
<p>The Humanities Library was transformed and expanded from the Jiazi Society, and was initiated by Mr. Shen and his friends, as was the Jiazi Society, and it is the predecessor of the current Hongying Library. Mr. Shen is punctual in his work every day, and there is no backlog of work, 20 years as one day.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen's spirit of doing things lies in "not being sloppy" and "calmness". Mr. Pan Yangyao recorded the parallel events of the former Mr. and encouraged himself and others with the two words "not sloppy". He said that "When he was in charge of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association in the past, when dealing with official documents, even if there was a mistake in one word, he had to correct it before it was over, and he tried his best to prevent the clerks from being sloppy, and he always said that once the pen and ink were sloppy, he would know that the person was rough and playful in doing things." That's right, Mr. Shen wrote a note casually, and he wrote it home with every stroke, and he was never sloppy.</p>
<p>In the second year of the Republic of China, when Mr. Shen was the Secretary of Civil Affairs, the Nanjing Governor's Office was besieged by Huang Xing. At that time, the general staff members lost their minds when they heard the police, but Mr. Shen still routinely looked at 200 official affairs! That kind of calmness shows Mr. Shen's seriousness, strength and unsluggishness.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen is not willing to let go of time casually. He engages in writing after his official business. He either does not release his hand from the book or his pen does not stop waving. On the road, Mr. Shen sat in the car, holding the book with both hands, and Wang Fu looked just like a "Wen Chang". He attaches importance to practice and believes in Confucius' spirit of knowing that it is impossible to do it. He said in the chapter of Zhongyong Road is not far from people: "Words and deeds are often said to be the same." Beginners should start from this. He also said that the most important point of Zhongyong and University is the word "sincerity". The most important thing in establishing sincerity is the word "self-discipline". He also said that the university "He is the servant of the villain who does good for the country" should be read as a sentence. The villain who does good should be read as five words in a row. Doing good is like doing good. This is especially unprecedented. Because Guang Sheng is proficient in elementary school, he has this discovery and gets this clear and precise Huo interpretation. His academic thoughts are all derived from Confucianism, but they are different from the so-called "Taoism". He is very funny. He loves young people to talk about all kinds of issues, and he always encourages and guides the younger generation, and he is tireless in teaching people. He never admits that he is old. After the age of seventy, he still does not have a white hair on his head. He took Lao Tzu's words "Like an infant who has not yet grown up" and carved a "square seal", and also called himself Ruo Ying.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen's learning is deep in the exegesis and textual research of the Book of Changes. He has written two monographs, History of Yi Learning and Current Interpretation of Place Names in Spring and Autumn. Of course, these two monographs are remarkable. I remember that my friend Mr. Gu Qiaoruo wanted to publish the latter one for Mr. Shen, but he repeatedly asked Mr. Shen. Mr. Shen said: "I am afraid that there are still some inappropriate things. I have to revise it and dare not publish it immediately." From this, we can see Mr. Shen's serious attitude towards writing. Mr. Shen's poetic interest is especially good after the age of sixty, and he writes more poems. When a poem is completed, he always comes to me, "Think about it, please change it." The humble attitude of the old generation is really unattainable.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen's calligraphy started with Liu, and later he learned Wang. But in everyone's opinion, his regular script turns out to be like Lu Gong's breath. Mr. Shen's method of practicing calligraphy is to turn the big into the small and the small into the big. In terms of compiling couplets, there are stone classics, Preface to the Orchid Pavilion, Tao, Du, Li Changji, poems of various schools, and Song Ci, etc., totaling hundreds of pairs.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen does not drink alcohol or smoke. His hobbies are porcelain and calligraphy and painting. It is said that Mr. Shen's first virtue, Mr. Xiangzhi, had a rich collection of ancient porcelain, calligraphy and famous paintings, but they were all robbed by the vanguard of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Now Mr. Shen has a collection of 200 exquisite porcelain bottles, so he named his studio 200 bottles. There are also many calligraphy and paintings. In this regard, there are also two kinds of writings, Porcelain Record and Calligraphy and Painting Record.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen usually pays attention to health preservation. He does 15 minutes of gymnastics every day. From the age of 50 to more than 70, he has not interrupted for more than 20 years. He is very cautious about the weather and the warmth. Every day when he goes to the Hongying Library, we often see him in and out of the car, always carrying a white bag with him. He always wants to look at the thermometer as the standard for him to change clothes.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen's actions are not sloppy, his writing is respectful, and he pays attention to health preservation, so he has become his "longevity phase".</p>
<p>Mr. Shen succeeded Mr. Yuan Guanlan as the head of the Hongying Library. Hongying has been one of the top libraries in Shanghai, with a collection of more than 150,000 volumes, 320,000 to 30,000 pieces of various case references, and more than 1.8 million pieces of historical materials. The average number of monthly readers is 800 to 900 people. However, in terms of funding, in recent years, due to the change of the monetary system, it has been quite exhausted, so Mr. Shen hopes to increase funding every day. June 1st this year is his 80th birthday, but Mr. Shen absolutely does not advocate celebrating his birthday in his life; the elites from all walks of life in the city, because Mr. Shen's morality and articles are admired by the world, and on this occasion of great celebration, there must be a memorial, so they launched a public view, taking Mr. Shen's ambition as his ambition, moving the guests to the wine, and taking the library as a fund to fill the library, to live a long life and leave a long-lasting memorial. This is how Mr. Shen got his consent, so Mr. Shen is eighty and is celebrating for the first time!</p>
