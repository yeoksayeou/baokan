<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">談民族健康 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>「强國必先强種」，換一句說，就是提高「民族健康，」是每一個民族，每一個國家，立足於世，必須講求的最基本時一點。如果民族不健康，這民族構成的國家，必然是散漫無力。證諸世界各國强弱的事實，莫不如此。</p>
<p>退一步就個人的健康而言，同樣是事業成敗的關鍵。「健全之事業，厲於健康的體魄之中」，已爲每一個人所正確認識了。所以，爲個人事業着想，固須講求健康；爲國家民族事業着想，更須講求健康。我們要促起國人注意，把我們向上的國家，扶置在健康的民族之上。</p>
<p>我們中國民族的健康，不必諱言的是大有問題的。外國人譏笑我們是「東亞病夫」，這就指出我們民族的不健康。自從鴉片戰爭以後，毒害所趨，更戕害斲傷了我們民族的健康。今天我們在世界大動盪之中，允須警惕我們的民族健康，洗刷「東亞病夫」的恥辱。</p>
<p>我們的身長和體重，因地理的區分，有着比較的差別。北方人比較體高，南方人比較體矮，如用數字來表示，平均的統計，黃河流域的男子高度六六·六吋，長江流域的男子高度六五吋，珠江流域的男子高度六四。一吋。體重的比例，也有着大致如上的差別。但以北方體格去考空軍，根據以往歷屆中國空軍招生統計，山東人及格的最多也不過占百分之十五至二十而已。就壯丁而論，合於服役標準的，也許不到百分之四十。在事變以前，曾有一次檢查各大城市二十三萬學童的體格，結果有缺點的佔了百分之九十以上。年來更因營養的不良，醫藥的缺乏，一般的說，民族健康實際上還要低下，這是國人應加深切警惕的第一點。</p>
<p>現代健康醫藥進步的國家，所已經根絕或已减少的幾種病症，在中國還是蔓延着。第一肺癆。上海市衛生局前曾測騐過千餘學生，結果帶癆菌的佔了百分之八十七，現在各地的情形，恐也相當可觀。第二霍亂。防疫工作，雖甚勤勞，而偏於都市，鄉僻地方，仍相當活躍，允無傳染病設備的醫院，對於傳染病的蔓延，常致手足無措。第三痧眼。幾乎已經侵入家家戶，投考空軍不及格的有百分之四十一，是爲了眼的缺點。第四花柳病。蔓延得非常普遍，各地暗娼的存在，病的種子無從剷除。據一般醫生的經騐而言，產婦血液，呈梅毒陽性反應者，佔半數以上。想僱一個淸潔的奶媽，有時也很困難。第五瘧疾。這病在西南各省，由來猖獗。第六痢疾，第七傷寒，也常常及時而興，大肆殘害。雖然我們手頭沒有近時統計，但事變以後的死亡率，特別是嬰孩死亡率，一定增高。事變以前，中國死亡率，大的是三十，（每千人一年死三十人）比歐美各國高一倍或兩倍。中國嬰孩死亡率，（一歲內的）大的是二百，比歐美各國高四倍或五倍，現在或者更高了。死亡疾病，雖爲人類所不免，但由於過多的病苦，破格的死亡，不僅人力財力損失無算，甚至可以摧毀一個種族，使一個國家沉淪深淵，不易拯起。這是國人應加深切警惕的第二點。</p>
<p>健康之道多端，人人所可以奉行，可以實踐者，的有下列數點：</p>
<p>（一）食物注重營養。中國的食譜上，在饜足味覺的一點，美不勝收。過去我們嘗以食自豪，占有世界廚房二分之一。然殊不知這廚房大有問題，我們不但吃窮了，且也吃病了。今後對於吃，應該講究有無營養價値，不在悅口，要求養生，吃的對象，不妨寂寞簡單，而身體所需要的物質，不可令其缺一，雖然在此物價高漲，生活困厄情况之下，一般人民對於吃，事實上已經不夠飽，更談不到悅口，可是營養價値，不一定限於貴品，還須儘可能設法替代，不令缺失。</p>
<p>（二）注意運動。運動設備及提倡，年來雖有進步，但缺少體力勞動習慣的人，多少尙愛好着病態美。如戶外運動，早晨柔軟操，游泳諸類，俱宜提倡。</p>
<p>（三）注重淸潔。我們缺少淸潔的習慣，一般人常有隨地吐痰，不勤洗澡，任衣衫油垢的習慣，對公共衛生的美德，尤少訓練，如沿江如黑暗的路旁，隨便糞便，臭氣蒸發。</p>
<p>（四）吸收空氣陽光。造房子和城市設計，應留一定的空間，使有淸新的空氣，充足的陽光，在都市裏的人，也應該出去呼吸新鮮空氣，多與日光見面。</p>
<p>（五）有充足的睡眠，以恢復疲勞。</p>
<p>（六）有愉快的心情，使心廣體胖。</p>
<p>以上列舉的，都是尋常可以實踐的健康途徑。至於怎樣撲滅各種流行病，和怎樣提高國民體格，有的關於醫藥問題，有的關於公共衛生行政，有的關於衛生敎育和衛生工程，有的關於社會政策，有的關於學校敎育，自非短文所能盡言。我們爲了减少人口死亡率，振起報國的努力，今天鄭重提出，國家向上，必先使民族健康向上。</p>

<p>羅馬三十日中央社電據馬德里電：西班牙海軍部鑒於各地盛傳反軸心軍將在巴利巴利羣島登陸，特於二十九日發表聲明稱；西班牙驅逐艦六艘均爲一五三噸級組成之艦隊，已自喀地基那港出動赴馬佐卡島之巴爾馬。按該艦隊出動之目的，表面雖稱係屬演習性質，然據觀測，實係由於反軸心軍欲登陸，作爲强化巴利巴利島之防備，遂出此急遽之手段。最近頻傳反軸心軍對巴利巴利華島實抱有莫大野心，反軸心軍於開始侵略撒丁後，即將佔據巴利巴利島，聞其計劃或係使該羣島成爲侵略撒島補給路之中繼點。根據各種情勢，此次西班牙艦隊出動，實堪注目。</p>

<p>瑪德里三十日中央社電「ＡＢＣ報」軍事訪員稱，英美不能在東亞及歐洲同時發動大規模攻勢，協約軍參謀部深知進攻歐陸，需要龐大之給養組織，人力與物力將遭受重大之損失，在歐洲建立第二戰綫，將消耗反軸心國之作戰力量，美國有事於東亞之際，似亦不欲集中兵力於歐洲云。</p>

<p>東京三十日中央社電</p>
<p>日大本營本日下午五時發表：（一）阿圖島日守備部隊自本月十二日與美軍交戰以來，即於極度艱難之情况下，以寡兵禦敵，繼續苦戰多日。迄二十九日夜乃決定舉全力，對敵軍主力部隊作最後壯烈之猛攻，而發揮日軍勇武之精神。經多時之血戰後，通信忽吿完全斷絕，是乃認係全員業已殉難。蓋於此戰役前，一般傷病兵不得從事攻擊者，乃悉數先行自盡。該島日守備部隊爲山崎保代陸軍大佐，士兵僅二千數百人，而敵軍則擁有特殊優秀裝備及的二萬名之將兵。但迄本月二十八日爲日軍擊亡者已達六千人之多。（二）斯加島（Kissa在阿圖島之東）刻仍由日軍確保。</p>
<p>東京二十日中央社電</p>
<p>日大本營陸軍報道部長谷萩那華雄氏，本日下午七時就本日大本營發表之阿圖島戰况及該島日軍守備部隊奮戰之情形，特以「關於阿圖島之血戰」爲題，發表廣播講演，大意如次：守備阿圖島之日軍部隊與敵血戰二日，終於全員壯烈殉難，其壯烈奮勇之精神，誠足驚泣鬼神。蓋於阿圖島登陸之美軍的二萬人，擁有戰車及優秀之重武器，或會受有山地及露中作戰之相當訓練，並由有力之艦隊及空軍掩護進行作戰，故其實力相當雄厚。我方則僅有由山崎保代陸軍大佐統率之士兵二餘人，且僅備有大砲數門，是以形成衆寡懸殊之勢。敵軍於海陸空三方面進攻作戰時，即反復以熾烈之砲火猛擊，但我軍則謹愼防守伺機出擊，分別擊潰敵軍予以重創將之擊退。迨本月二十七日左右敵。乃逐漸向我方陣地進迫，旋即以利刀手溜彈等展開白刃戰，雖於此慘烈悲壯之情况下，我山崎部隊長並未曾一次要求增援一兵，亦未請求補給一粒子彈，似此視死如歸之忠勇意氣，凡人無不感佩，且於戰鬥正酣之際，並將敵軍之編成裝備戰術，以及於此閃戰鬥中所得之經騐教訓，與將來作戰取法之處，均詳細紀錄，逐决上呈報吿。其有書云：「於此砲火交迫之際，難保不無危機，且恐通信亦將斷絕，是以抽機以視察所得，據詳上陳」。此種强烈之忠誠心與偉大之責任心，實可謂舉世罕見。如是連日連夜苦戰，日軍士氣始終極爲旺盛，然自死傷者陸續發生，至二十八日止生存者僅百數十人，而敵人則繼續補充新銳增强配備。山崎大佐觀情况之推移，乃毅然採取最後之決心，即於二十九日夜搜索敵方主力集團，實行最後之攻擊，因傷病不克參加者，則於發起攻擊之先，悉數自決，山崎大佐於諸事處置完畢，遂將此事詳細報吿上司長官謂：「吾等覺悟不應僥倖於萬一，沾汚武人之名節，故與部下微笑中一同殉難」，報吿至最後，電報即吿斷絕。此最後之攻擊情况，如何凄慘勇壯，當不難想像。五月二十七日美國之新聞解說汗特曾指摘攻略阿圖島之困難，謂美陸軍中將赫爾擇姆會稱，日軍實屬堅强，且均係決死勇敢之鬥士，允於困難情勢下，更能發揮其特性，此於太平洋各戰綫戰况即可證實。今日軍於阿圖島乃復以其勇敢戰鬥，據自西南太平洋戰綫歸還之兵士所言，於某地作戰時，日軍雖僅餘最後一兵，仍以武器猛烈抗戰，依此覘之，可知美軍欲制壓阿圖島之日軍實屬困難。日軍「不勝利勿寗死」之精神，足使美軍心寒。該守備隊將兵於決行最後攻擊之時，並曾向本國遠拜，高呼大元帥陛下萬歲，於歡笑中而就大義。</p>
<h3 id="c13">達爾文港被炸 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>里斯本三十日中央社電據新金山來電，西南太平洋反軸心軍司令部廿七日發表公報稱：日航空部隊廿七日曾轟炸達爾文港東部地區，致該地受有相當損害。</p>

<p>羅馬三十日中央社電據海通社訊，羅馬政界人士認爲英外相艾登前日在樸資茅斯所發表之演說，爲英美對義大利一般之恫嚇言論，英美此種慣技，實爲未能瞭解義大利之之民氣所致，要和英美報章與無綫雷台之恐嚇言論及眞實之空襲，其結果適足增强義大利人民仇恨之心理。反軸心機之空襲，專以城市爲目標，並不以軍事設備爲對象，故其作用亦爲對義大利之威嚇而已。但義大利人民決不因此而氣餒。艾稱所稱義欺侮缺乏自衛力量之法國，實屬荒謬。義大利參戰時，要知法國在其西南疆所集中者，均爲配備齊全之精銳軍隊，反之，英軍之襲擊達加與馬達加斯加與英美之聯合進攻法屬北非，則不知英美將何以自解。</p>

<p>德軍當局頃就英機濫炸德國事表明意見，略謂大戰開始後，希特勒元首會向反軸心方面建議，互不轟炸平民，但彼等拒不接受而以轟炸代答覆。德國方面乃予警吿，倘若不改故態，則德國將行報復，以待英國反省。德國隱忍巳久，但彼等依然如故，其轟炸之情况完全與開戰當時無異，故不久之將來，德機即將施行報復轟炸云。</p>

<p>瑞典京城三十日中央社電東綫自北冰洋起至黑海沿岸止，綿延的二千八百公里，其中包括有自諾伏洛西斯克至列寗格勒戰綫約一千八百公里，芬蘭戰綫約一千公里。在此廣大戰綫上，近數日來德蘇兩軍以庫彭區，唐納資河中游列寗格勒區，掇里克爾基等地爲中心，行動日漸活躍，全綫乃頓覺異常緊張。刻兩軍雖僅於庫彭橋頭堡一地展開激戰，但於其他各戰綫，兩軍俱已準備就緒，彼此待機而動。此次夏季作戰，今後將於何處首先發動，刻雖無從推測，但不致於意外之方面展開。據德方消息稱，蘇方大軍於過去日間，不顧大犧牲，反覆猛攻德方之三角形陣地，此項陣地即以德軍所扼守之自寇許半島至諾伏洛西斯克間約一百公里地帶爲底邊，另二邊爲庫彭橋頭堡方面之德軍陣地，其長度一爲八十公里，一爲六十五公里。蘇軍此舉實企圖奪取高架案方面之德軍立足點，俾對夏季作戰萬全準備。同時並於黑海方面，企圖奪回塞巴斯托波爾及諾伏洛西斯克軍港。而德方之見解，似認爲庫彭橋頭堡在戰略上雖有相當價値，但就東綫全綫以觀，則並無任何特別重要性。康彭橋頭堡在戰略上之價値，對於蘇軍及對於德軍實並不相同，此實堪注視。但就過去數日間戰况以觀，則德蘇兩軍俱出動陸空有力部隊相激戰，如二十八日蘇機於泰曼半島上空被擊落五十六架，當地消息靈通方面人士稱，庫彭戰綫之戰况，與夏季作戰有關，基經過實堪重視。</p>
<p>柏林三十日中央社電　德國新聞社軍事特派員哈瑪上校宣稱：二十八日庫彭橋頭堡大規模防守戰中之特點，即爲德空軍襲擊蘇聯進攻部隊之大獲勝利。德方轟炸及俯衝機羣，竟日不斷空襲蘇聯之來複槍聯隊及坦克車隊予以重創，至午後蘇軍會一度深入德軍陣綫，戰事至此乃達頂點，旋經德軍後備擲彈兵一中隊猛力反攻，雙方肉搏，擊毀蘇聯坦克車十二輛，另有十六輛則被德空軍轟毀。蘇軍之主要壓力，係加諸基耶維斯柯雅與摩爾達伐斯柯雅以東之德軍陣地。據德軍界人士之意見，蘇軍指揮部因三日前突破德陣地企圖失敗，現將採用大規模消耗戰之策略，但鑒於蘇軍所遭之損失，可見此項計劃將永難成功。且蘇軍之兵員武器的十倍於德軍，而至今仍毫無所獲。蘇軍在本月最初三週中屢遭頓挫，故攻取諾伏洛西斯克之意向顯已打消，灘在台留克附近之鹹湖區域中，蘇軍曾再度進攻，包圍德軍防禦陣地，幸德軍早已窺破其意，故經短時間之交戰後即行解圍。德空軍之轟炸機羣脅在同區內襲擊集中之蘇軍船隻，共擊沉滿載之登陸用艇十六艘，蘇方亦會於星期五日出動强大機隊，轟炸德軍供應路綫，數度空戰之結果，德戰鬥機在泰曼半島上空擊落蘇機四十六架，另有十架則被斯洛伐克機隊所擊落。東綫其他各段祇有里西强斯克東北唐納資中部之區域曾有大戰，該處蘇軍屢决進攻德軍所控制之高地，以若干來福槍聯隊及强大之坦克軍隊加入作戰，傍晚始停止此項無效之嘗試，中央戰區之蘇軍衝鋒部隊頗呈活躍，列寗格勒前之蘇聯砲火極爲猛烈，此或爲該區蘇軍擬發動攻勢之先聲。里斯本卅日中央社電</p>

<p>本文是煎駐美特命全權大使野村吉郞海軍大將，在海軍紀念日由京都府國防協會，海軍協會京都府支部所主辦，而由京都新聞社，每日新聞社，朝日新聞社贊助的紀念講演會中的演詞。要旨如次。</p>
<p>「羅斯福的美國』，沿襲威爾遜之流的大世界政策，並不想踢蹐於美洲大陸，對中國堅持九國公約時代的門戶開放，機會均等主義，以中國四萬萬民衆爲銷售他們商品的尾閭，所以不贊成亞洲人的亞細亞主義，他們一心想使中日相爭，以挫耗日本的勢力。獎國人民，現在似已承認美國的這大帝國全義，不過有一部份人士則尙潛伏着孤立主義的思想，今後如再敗績，或許多少要發生輿論分裂的情况。羅斯福很明瞭這情勢。英首相也曾在前幾天的美國議會中聲述不可作長期戰的意義。美國對戰爭的態度，完全快要變成全體主義的了，他們的戰爭目標，也仍是中立時所決定的『大西洋意章』在遠東方面，因在續戰中慘敗，所以想集中全部勢力於遠東。因爲邱吉爾慌忙飛赴美國，想阻止美國不要從大西洋方面退却。</p>
<p>本年初的加盟勃期加會談後。羅斯羅，軍人，政治家都吳口同聲的說：『戰亞對方無條件投降時方休。』此次的華症頓會談，似很起勁地討論着究竟廳注重東戰綫呢，還是應注重西戰綫的問廳。我總在這裏指出，美國依然維持歐洲第一主義，屬美國則生張太平洋應與大西洋兼籌並顧，不分珍藏。他們說：「我們的敵人，東方西方都是一樣的。』現在美國陸軍海軍的主力都在太平洋，空軍也重視這方面。美國與論舉行民意測騐，主張以德國爲第一者三成，以日本爲第一者達六成。第一次世界大戰時，國家經費的三分之一耗於戰爭，此次則達百分之八十九。第一次大戰時，一天的戰費是四千萬美元，此次則一天達一萬萬美元，最近竟達二萬萬五千萬美元。此數目中用於海軍的金額，爲數極鉅所以他們也說：「此次的戰爭，決不半途而廢。」</p>
<p>我們應充分明瞭這當前的局勢，而東條總理的所謂：『雄渾的戰略』的必要，就在於此。然則美國今後在東亞究竟預備怎樣呢？他們還不預備如日本海海聯那樣用多數艦隊來進行大決戰，而致力於空戰。因爲去年四月杜里茲特爾空襲日本的失敗，日本有着地利的條件，所以他們正在想進據靠近日本的地方以爲航空基地。所羅門，新幾尼亞，中途島，阿留申，中國大陸的蠢動，即其表現。印度，西比利亞的沿海洲，也在其考慮中。史達林對沿海州非常愼重所以不能不嚴予警戒。同時在飛機之質的改良，空戰能力的昻揚，空軍戰士的養成各方面，亦正在急起直追。美國視空戰比普通軍艦更爲重要，注其全力於航空母艦，此即就人的配置看來，也顯然可見。其次，說到潛水艦作戰，因在大西洋中給油船被德國潛水艦大量擊沉的綠故，所以也效法德國，改取潛水艙戰術，在議會中通過潛艙大建造案，企麗威脅日本的四周。東亞共榮圈的物資，是用船舶運輸的，所以日本也應急於請求增强各種戰力的方策，以應付敵人的企圖。此次的大戰，究是長期的遼是短期的尙在未定之天，但我以爲長期戰的態勢是絕對必要的。戰爭的要啼，要在決戰塲中，保持勝過敵人的優勢，才能戰勝敵人。所以一億人民在前綫後方應打成一片，以壓倒敵人。一</p>
<p>明年是總選舉的年份了。無論那個偉大的演員，從序幕到告終，因不斷的在舞台上出現，終是要被人討厭的。羅斯福也似乎漸漸的爲了失去人心而焦慮着，不過不能因敵人的弱點而自忽，我們應加緊培養實力，向最後的勝利邁進。（翔：譯自五月二十八日東都朝日新聞）</p>

<p>— 德富豬一郎</p>
<p>續二十日本報</p>
<p>（八）元首的個人主義</p>
<p>愛德華八世並無不世出的奇　。他聽到過一切，看見過一切，接待過各種各樣的人物，遭過了種種塲面，這些都與他的年齡不相稱。他的智識只不過同照相機一樣，把一旬東四照原梯片斷的攝取起來，並未對某一種有特別的造詣。他沒有深慮，沒有自書，沒有擔憂，也沒有憂鬱。高興地，可笑地，隨便地，放肆地度着他悠閒的歲月。他在少年時贊參加世界大戰。在實際戰爭中得到勇敢的贊許。總而言之，他討嫌規規矩矩的事情，喜歡破壞定型，他的日常生活，總是越出軌道的。因此，他極受勞働階級的據戴，沒有他曾祖母維多利亞女皇所其的那份嚴肅，而世人也多以爲他足以繼承共祖父愛德華七世的衣缽。</p>
<p>而且他曾到世界各地旅行，誇揚英國是世界上唯一的商品大傾售人。他以爲一般人也都那樣想法。他就那樣到處收拾人心。他訪問日本的時候，恰在大正十一年四月華盛頓簽字的當口。我們沒有留下了什麼別的深刻印象，不過記憶起當時的新聞曾記載着說：皇太子從日光赴中禪寺的中途茶店中，着了工人穿的號衣，叫其隨從乘在人力車上，他自己做車夫拉着跑，並又見過那付情景的一張照相。領有世界三分之一的土地，擁有世界四分之一人口的大帝國的皇太子，決不能說這不過一時的高興，任何人都不能不有這樣的感想吧！</p>
<p>皇太子到處表演種種軌外的行動，某次聽說從馬上掉下，折斷頭骨，而成爲議會的問題。</p>
<p>他生於一八九四年，在一九三六年即位，三百二十五天之後，於同年的十二月十一日退位。這就是所謂辛浦生夫人事件。關於這件事，世間已有很多的記載。但我們對那記載決不感到興趣。何况此事已成過去，他已是溫莎公爵而過享福的生活了。不過我們所以要提起者，當我們說到英國的崩潰，就不能看過這種事件。個人主義怎梯貫澈英國的國民，英國的君主的頭腦中，這是一個有力的證據。像這種事件的出現，英國人還苒要想用對皇室的忠誠來互相理解，以爲維繫大英帝國的一種力量，正是難平其難了。</p>
<p>皇太子弟兄共三人，還有二個都已經結婚了，獨其長兄皇太子尙是獨身，這是不可思議的。以一個皇太子的地位，如其要結婚，他的候補者必求之於某宮庭或望族。然而出於意外地，發生了辛沛生事件。</p>
<p>辛浦生夫人一般人都說她是猶太人血統，這話或許是對的。總之那女人是生於美國的巴爾的摩。她的名字叫華麗斯，華妃爾特。在及筓之年，與美國的海軍中尉斯賓塞結婚，也曾往來於上海及北京等地，不知爲了甚麼綠故與年輕的海軍飛行士官斯實塞離婚了，不久與所謂辛沛生者要好起來。辛浦生是旣婚的男子，也無綠無故的與原來的髮妻離異，而與那女子結婚。他的職務是辛浦生船公司的代理人，居住於倫敦。</p>
<p>不久，辛浦生夫婦與皇太子投機起來，皇太子親自駕駛着汽車，從夜總會裏送辛浦生夫婦問家。而且據宮中的記載看來，皇太子如其招待晚餐，被招待者中問往往有辛浦生夫婦的名字，大家都很奇怪，像那樣名不見經傳的人士，何以受皇太子這樣的優待。於是不久宮庭錄事中的記載，不再是辛浦生夫婦了，僅有辛浦生夫人獨個子與共他知名的人受招待。更奇怪的，當皇太予到地中海邊的的特去旅行時，她成爲他的旅伴，並又一同到奇羅爾山中的冬季競技揚去遊玩。皇太子到那裏，辛浦生夫人總是如影隨形，有她的名字。因而皇太子的旅行中，因與辛浦生夫人同行，故不受一切正式的招待。因此惹起了很多人批評。</p>
<p>於是二人在地中沿岸附近的市街出外賈物的照相，也被美國的報紙無顧忌地揭載出來，人家對於他的評論，從鄰近的地方擴展到美國甚至於遠離祖國的殖民地了。</p>
<p>在這時候，喬治五世於一九三六年一月二十一目逝世了。皇太子踐祚爲愛德華八世。做了皇帝後最引起世界的驚奇者，在該年八月，皇帝乘「奈林」號從的特巡幸地中海的亞得利亞海方面之際，究然有辛浦生夫人共人參加在內。在此次旅行中，任何塲合，不應一切英國皇帝個人所應受的招待，因此，破了傳統的例，匈牙利政府遂招待愛德華八世及辛浦生夫人。</p>
<p>至該年十月，華麗斯。辛浦生夫人離婚訴訟的消息漸漸傳播出來。辛浦生夫人控訴其夫阿奈斯特。辛浦生對自己破壞貞節，而成立離婚訴訟。經過六個月的時間，辛浦生夫人的離婚確定了，得到了可與任何人結婚的自由。</p>
<p>至一九三六年十二月，果然引起人軒然大波。雖然一切的新聞雜誌對此均守沈默，但議會竟以此事提出爲問題。當事美國的新聞王哈斯特恰在他的英國威爾斯別邸，與皇帝的輔助秘書托瑪斯會面，知道了底細，立即拍電越過大西洋而到達了太平洋岸。電文說：</p>
<p>『巴爾的摩的阿奈斯特。辛浦生夫人，於數目內可得到離婚的許可，八個月之後，將與英國國王愛德華八世結婚』。</p>
<p>事日至此，不能默視了。議會遂正式討論這件事。</p>
<p>首相鮑爾溫爲此事曾謁見數决。但終不能改變皇帝的決心。皇太后瑪麗幾次三番的向皇帝勸諫，自然不消說得。辛浦生夫人聲稱：『自身決沒有一切妨害皇帝的決意的情事』，意思就是說，縱令皇帝取消結婚的的束，她自己毫無異議，但皇帝自始即有結婚的意志，不辭王位而結婚，他不要辛浦生夫人取得皇后的待遇，他想把他們所生養的孩子，不算皇室相續的系統，以了此局。然而英國無此先例終不果行。</p>
<p>在個人主義的英國，不少人同情這件事，說「皇帝堅持貫澈其意志」。議會也有人說：「這不是國王個人的私事嗎？沒有我們置議的餘地」，想把這件事囫圇過去。</p>
<p>我們不是以個人的地位對愛德華八世加以何種批判，如其想起國王的天職是甚麽？那末，在這種最後僵局到來之前，應加反省吧！然而他沒有反省，世間對此亦沒有反省，許多人視爲不足爲奇，任其行雲流水般過去，遭從一方而看來是實利主義，便宜主義的國家，而從另一方面看來，是徹頭徹尾的個人主義的國家。同時這種行動，是否有團結大英聯邦的紐帶的力量，亦不能不是一個疑問。中國人有句俗語說：『駕馭杇索所繫的六匹馬』，與此情形差不多。那麼，還有甚麼東西可以防禦，阻止大英帝國的崩潰呢？進退維谷，所恃者唯美國而已。然而這也不過是寰　的靑蛙，跳入毒蛇的口中龍了。（全文完）翔：那自五月六日西部每日新聞）</p>

<p>安定民生，在於减輕人民生活負担，减輕人民負担，在於抑平日用物品價格。這是十二分顯明的一個方案，雖不是硏究經濟學者，亦無不深體此義。</p>
<p>近聞最高當局將以統一工商業組織機構，厲行評價制度，促進各地交易及運輸之發展，發揮中日工廠及企業界的生產效率等四個對策，爲實施經濟統制的基礎。這樣幾個對策，可以說無一不是解除或减輕人民生活恐慌的一種切要措施，而我們所認爲最合於當前急切補救的方法，自莫如厲行評價制度。</p>
<p>我們屢經說過，解決當前物價問題的第一個要義，在於求得物價的合理化；對於廠商之成本與利潤，予以最合理的計算，然後依據此項計算，定爲最合理的價格，使各種商品的批發商與零售商，均得保持其人口法利潤，無所藉　而抬價，那末，自不得不上體在評價方式之下，進行其各個的正常與正當的交易。所以，厲行評價制度，實爲目前解決物價問題的最佳辦法。</p>
<p>可是，凡百事件，治法與治人並重；旣定有評價制度，即須有評價人員；於是評價人員的組織，乃爲厲行評價制度的先決問題。我們感覺　選　評價人員的理想標準，當視其對於各種商品商情的實際經境與學識爲何如，而不當僅以其在工商界是居地位，所負聲望爲如何，因爲聲望是一件事，實地經騐與實際學問又是一件事。</p>

<p>整天潛曲了背，捂着身子在電燈光下工作，六年來，我們的生活是這般地過渡着，可是得到的遭遇，竟是出乎意料之外的。現在讓我們藉這一角寳量的園地，作一個暢快而又沉痛的呻吟吧！</p>

<p>可是店主養着三個妻子，二十多個孩子和男女傭人，他們每天在山珍海味中生活。六年來，一盆靑菜和粥底非常生活；六年來、四個同伴做着十多位夥友的工作、奏起生活的哀音，不知在什麽了時候可以改變我們的生活而趨向光明！</p>

<p>— 史亭</p>
<p>沿着蒼茫的夕陽道，閑步在溪邊。晚風輕輕拂起我們的亂髮，蘊含着濃重的土地氣息，已經消失了料峭的春寒；春才來，又忽怱去了。這兒的春天竟是這末的短促！我不禁太息着。</p>
<p>晚霞褪淡了鮮艷的彩色，灰藍色的，暗紫色的…………靜靜飄浮在天邊，是覓食歸來的烏鴉吧，惘然號叫在樹巔，找尋他們的歸宿．母親們拖長着微啞的喉聲，喚呼野遊的孩子。</p>
<p>初夏的傍晚充溢着夢似的隱秘和寂靜，詩人們曾吟咏過；就是在這個乓荒馬亂，處　烽火的年頭，兒的傍晚，初夏的傍晚，不依舊是夢一般的隱秘和寂靜嗎？汚濁的溪水流着，流着………平靜地，沒有旋渦的疾轉，水花的迸濺！銹蝕的鐵絲網，木架已大部傾斜了，還緊緊纏繞着溪邊，有幾處斷脫了的鐵絲，迎着晚風微微在顫動，原野似乎永還忍受住他身上的束縛，負起混身的創夷，伸展在小溪的那面；被碎的瓦礫偎依着殘垣斷壁，逃空了人影的樓屋張着創傷的眼睛，黯淡地朝向夕陽。幾年來，依舊是那末的悽惋，寥凉；白日的時候，還有些農民默默地在溪邊耕耘他們的菜田。如今，只有一羣羣負米者的行列，穿竄在斷壁問，閃着倉猝的影子，聽說，這兩天的米價又便宜了，街上許多賣米的叫上門來，也沒人要。但是聆聽他們的叫喊，聲調總是淡淡的，沒有哀傷，也沒有怨　。…</p>
<p>初夏的傍晚，這兒充溢着隱秘和寂靜，抑鬱的隱秘和寂靜喲</p>
<p>我們低吟起「冷淸淸的落照，剩一樹柳彎腰』的詞句來。</p>
<p>『你帶着另錢嗎？一個求乞的孩！」突然，觸動我的手臂，加快了脚步。</p>
<p>我順着他的眼光望去：一個八九歲的孩子，拖動着不合尺寸的破鞋，打左邊跟上來，看來是沒有躱避的可能了，我摸索着衣袋，心裏想：『沒有另錢可窘啦</p>
<p>可是出乎意料之外，他並不是來求乞的，那雙預料該是伸出來求乞的執拗的手整整歪斜的領口，他熟視了我們一會見，詢問道：「爺叔！這可是菜市路？』</p>
<p>我惶惑地打景着：那末幼小的孩子，脆弱的腿拖着那寬大的被鞋，在朦朧的黃昏，竟摸索着走向菜市路去。</p>
<p>『小弟弟！你向菜市路幹嗎？這兒離菜市路還遠呢！』</p>
<p>他似乎喪失了什麽似地凝視着我的臉，又失望地瞥四周：『找　　！她三天沒有同家了！」</p>
<p>找媽媽？三天沒囘家？賣淫的？或是自盡了？……我立刻給這陌生的孩子的命運吸住了靈魂，驚異地望望邊上的Ｃ，他愕然注視着孩子的臉。也許他也在幻構那孩子的家：陰暗的小屋子，病了的父親……</p>
<p>『你媽是做什麼的？爲什麼三天不囘家？」我　緩地拍拍他的肩膀。</p>
<p>「媽媽？他映脥乾枯的眼皮，用手拭去了眼屎：『她是背米的，前天早上，給我們煮好了粥，她就出去了。她對哥哥說：『買幾　轟菔乾，吃兩頓粥，晚上我同來！』可是現在三天了，……哥哥說：「我來煮點粥，你到菜市路與　家　找找她」………」</p>
<p>他盯着迢迢的遠方閃映迷惘的眼光，淡漢地說：聲調是那末的平淡，沒有情感，似乎是在講述別人的事，有一個時俟，我曾懷疑過這寬　壽地虛造的故事，用來乞求的。</p>
<p>「那末，你的爸爸呢？」我　視　他　的　色，追問逍，像是在發掘他故事中的漏洞，——爲什麽他一點不提起父親？</p>
<p>「父親坐在巡捕房裏日經半月了，雖也不知這爲的什麽。間問、，她也搖頭。父親是倒垃圾的，他常常來巡捕房……可是，爺叔！菜市路在什麽地方？請你吿訴我怎末走法！』</p>
<p>我惘然愕住了，輕蔑的預期並不是事實。但是我將怎末指示他的路呢？一直去，轉左，再！右……孩子是苒也記不淸楚的。</p>
<p>「唔！菜市路一直去……可是，小弟弟，我看還是問家吧！天色已暗了，你這末小的孩子。賈迷路的。况且媽不見得曾在那兒，要是她在那兒的話，怎會遺棄了你們，三天不囘來？』</p>
<p>『不會的！』他堅決地說，「哥哥說：「她在那兒』』拖動起寬大的破桂，他又重新的前去丁。</p>
<p>我以目光遠送着他的背影，又瞧瞧遠處倉猝鑽動的負米者的影子，悄悄地自語着：「讓我去吿訴他吧！『你媽嫣不會在那兒的！她或許已不在人世了！』』</p>
<p>然而Ｃ緊緊握住了我的手，長嘆着：『別去戮傷他那幼稚的靈魂！天晚了，我們同家吧！」我依稀發覺他的眼眶裏還掛着晶瑩的淚！</p>
<p>暮色更來得深沉，四周漲漫了暗紫色的朦朧。茅屋的輪廓漸漸模糊了，寂靜沉壓着大地的嘆息，黃昏是更抑鬱了。</p>
<p>前面隱隱傳來破鞋拖動的拍而，孩子在摸索着。</p>

<p>— 周驌</p>
<p>「小倉山房尺牘」的『牘外餘言」中，有一段話道：</p>
<p>「唐許敬宗善醫而不肯著書，曰：『恐人得吾所言，而不能得吾所不言，必亂用藥矣。「此二語，可悟作詩文之逍。」</p>
<p>話雖寥寥幾句，但是，前人對作文的用心，以及對著述所抱的愼重的態度，便於此可見，實使人懋念古人的風度不止。</p>
<p>在今日，雖亦不乏不肯輕易落　的富有學養之士，但是貿然著述的人却也多如恒河沙數。其中，有一部份人，爲了生計問題，不得已而出此，其情還有可原；另一種人却全爲了圖博虛名，更是不足爲訓。不過，不論其動機如何，貿然著述的結果總是貽誤世人，都不是應該的！</p>
<p>以前在中學請書時數學敎師朱先生在課室內諄諄可矚我們，不到四十歲，不要發表什麼著作和文章，因爲學識和經騐都還沒到豐富成熱的境地。但是，一出校門，便將朱老師的忠言忘了。幾年來，在報紙副刊上登載了幾十篇雞零狗碎似通非通的東西，心中還『自鳴得意』。現在看到『小倉山房尺　』ｒ　『　外餘言』中的話，又想起來了朱老師的訓誡，益覺汗顏愧怍。『明知故犯』，且積習難改，禍棗災梨，實在是罪孽深重極了，阿彌陀佛。</p>

<p>— 凌祖仁</p>
<p>我鈔姓，名票，出身巨族，海上赫赫巨府——中央儲備銀行，就是我的本家。所以，人也尋稱我爲中儲券，別號Ｃ．Ｒ．Ｂ．</p>
<p>發行之初，我威力小試，一脚，就蹴關了舊法幣，以嶄新的姿態、統轉了它使用的市塲：這也是我生平第一件得意的事情。</p>
<p>之後，大江南北，就縱橫無敵，唯我獨尊了。</p>
<p>我的行隊，是無遠勿届，四海爲家的，眞同『萍蹤　跡』般地，飄怱然定。我做過像鼓起的靑蛙肚子一般的票夾裏的寄生蟲，也曾遯跡在娘兒們的手提袋內，和唇膏，香紙，粉匣，自來水筆，日記簿——等去作暫時的旅伴，也到過各種各樣的口袋裏，做高貴的寓客……</p>
<p>因爲；我時常在被人們從這兩隻手，交到那兩雙手地行着一種頻繁的移交手續，所以就使我經歷過種種不同的握手禮，那些祖糙的，油膩的，手指上塗有鮮艷的指甲油的，掌心裏留有濃烈的郞特列克香郁的…………我都接吻過。</p>
<p>不過，經騐却告訴我：凡是一些細膩，白嫩，柔軟，手指長而又細的手握着我時，它總是那般輕忽，隨便，似乎漫不經意似的。祗有那般粗糙而汚穢，手指旣短而又蠢肥的手，握着我的時候，他就好像把他全身的力氣，完全都交給了手指一般地，揑得我緊緊地，似乎怕我會脫逃似地，那種討厭的樣兒，每决，我總是恨恨地詛咒着的。</p>
<p>由於時常和落在我身上的人羣的目光接觸，所以，我就體騐到它有不少的型類：粗暴的，溫柔的，嬌媚的，……但是，它們却一式的有着一種像獵犬那般尖銳而金婪的眼色——誰都想佔有我，攫奪我。</p>
<p>我時常給人們買來了媚笑，甜吻，我也替一部分享樂主義的人們帶來了物質上窮奢極樂的享受，和精神上的愉快。但是，人們爲了我，也會因此而喪失去他們最寳貴的時問和精神。湮沒了純潔的理智，毀滅了錦繡的煎程。我也儘量的灌施給他們煩慣和苦痛的苦酒，可是，他們不眩怨恨我的殘膩，實在的，是他們的「咎由自取」呀！</p>
<p>我見到的人類，是絕對自私的。他們爲了我，互相的敵對·攻擊·失去了他們眞摯的友愛。有的，却因爲我的籠絡，而在表面上，大家假惺惺的擁着那種虛僞的　態、你哄我，我何嘗不可以哄你呢？我左右了人類的情感！我主宰了人類的動態！</p>
<p>世界上的人類。誰能夠佔有多量的我，就可以得到其它人類的尊重和敬仰。在他的背後，也習熱的會跟隨着不少的人，他說：「太陽是沒有光的。』那些人也說：「是的！太陽是沒有光。』假使他再說：「胡說！太陽是有光的。』那些人立刻也會說：「是的！太陽是有光的。」</p>
<p>他吸雪茄，就有不少的人去搶着擦火柴，時常、因爲搶捺火柴而互相的扛開了他們醜惡的頭——這是有鈔票的人的威風。</p>
<p>因爲，有鈔票的人，可以得到這般的光榮（？）所以，不少的人，就整天整夜的在謀劃着，企圖獲得一筆像天文學數字那般偉大的鈔票，於是，世界上是再也不會寗靜了。</p>
<p>如此的，那末，我就成了毒害人類靈魂的罪魁禍首，不過其實，還不是那些庸人的在自擾嗎？</p>
<p>你不要因爲我現時這般被爛的外表，而鄙棄我吧！我是一個身經百戰的英雄呀！現在我還有着一股强勁的力量，可以威脅得使喘息在生活重擔下的一些人們焦頭爛額呢？不相信嗎？那由你。</p>

<h3 id="c58">馮先生加了薪 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— 余懷瑞</p>
<p>四十來歲，中等身材，走路永遠是慢條斯理地，遇着人老是　着眼，嘴角挂着笑，顛顛頭：「嘿嘿…………你好。』這人是馮植齋，一個洋行裏的「寫字」。因爲居住歷史的悠久，和待人接物的和藹可親，所以住在文德里的人差不多每個人都認識他，大家尊敬地稱他一聲『馮先生」。</p>
<p>在過去，馮先生也有過一番光榮的歷史，那時可說是文德里惟一的樓範人物，弄內全體住戶的崇拜和仰慕的對象。當有人訴說別人壞處的時候，總喜歡抬出他的優點來作爲比較。女人們駡她們丈夫的時候，總是說：『沒出息的膿包，整天到夜地灌黃湯，賭瘟牌，你不看看人家馮先生，旣不喝酒，亦不賭錢，人再和氣沒有，而且又會賺錢，你呀，這沒用的東西，祇要能及他的一根汗宅就好了。』年邁的老太們在她們兒子和媳婦吵架的時候，也嗄着聲音嚷着：『你們一對尅星的寬家，前世不知作了甚麼孽，隔不了三天二天，就鬧得鷄啼狗叫的，也不怕別人人前背後的笑話，你們不看看人家馮先生，倆口子永遠客容氣氣，從不曾有過牙高言低，祇有你們這兩個寳貨…………」甚至孩子們向父母要求購買玩具或糖果什麼的時候，也會學着他們長輩的樣：「馮先生家的英兒，他爸爸早就替他買了我怎麼沒有呢？」</p>
<p>馮先生的能夠得到這樣的聲譽，倒也不是偶然的倖致，衆流歸川，是他日常所行所爲的歸聚的當然結果，他不但從沒有狎遊賭博等不良習慣，即使連幾乎已被認爲日常必需品的烟酒，也都不抽不喝的。每月又有相當的薪給收入，足夠維持一家三口的安定生活，所以假使『正人君子』四字不作反面解釋的話，那他就可當之無愧了。而且他的夫人又是個夠賢惠的女人，幫助他將家務操理得井井有條。他唯一的嗜好，祇有逢到星期或假日，領着夫人和孩逛逛公園，或看一塲電影，一方面娛樂自己，同時也作爲整天忙碌的夫人的慰酬：而他的夫人也在那一天置辦些較講究的菜肴，作爲辛勞的丈夫的享受。他們這樣的互相顧憐，互相慰藉，整個的家庭充溢着融融洩洩、的歡樂空氣，毋怪隣居們那樣的羨慕，那樣的推崇了。</p>
<p>但是這種種都已成爲過去的陳跡了，如今同想起來，祇剩了虛無隱的的輪廓，像埋藏在重霧中的一朶美麗的鮮花！</p>
<p>以前輕飄飄的生活担子，近幾年來，由於百物飛漲，像四遊記中孫行者背着紅孩兒的化身般越來越沉重了，使向來過着優遊歲月的馮先生累得幾乎喘不得氣來，雖然公園，電影，佳肴都早已自行放棄，一切開支也已省得無可再省，但依舊連最低的生活也時常弄得左支右細；夫人是賢惠的，她並沒有過半句怨允他的話，不過從她憂鬱的眼光裏，和語氣間無意的露出對於親友間那般因憑藉時勞所造成的英雄們－暴發戶－的羨慕，可見她內心中對於目前的處境也頗覺黯然不歡，夫人是他平素敬愛的人，見了她這種　　孤寡的情形，當然更使馮先生終日如處針氈，心中充滿着歉咎，憂急，煩惱等不安的情緒了。</p>
<p>已經是初夏的天氣，太陽也失去了春天時的溫靜和煦，曬在人們身上，祇增加了燥熱的感覺</p>
<p>像平日一樣馮先生這時疋由『寫字間」慢慢踏一了歸途，因爲他身上尙穿着夾衫所以分外覺得燥熱，汗珠微微地從他的額角上，鼻尖上滲出來，看看從他旁邊走過的人，有很多已穿着『派立司」長　了，這使他發覺自己的夾衫已失去了時宜，同時一般寒酸的感覺襲土了心頭，他不禁輕輕自語是該穿單衫的時禁候了</p>
<p>想起了軍衫，又不由得想起了那件袖子和領口都已發毛，且下擺上已鈎破了一個個的紡綢長衫。無論如何不能冉穿啦！』他心中暗暗地喊了一聲。本來是去年就該換新的了，但因爲料子昻貴，所以一直挨延着，不過今年却再也挨延不下去了。</p>
<p>想到這裏，他輕輕地按一下衣袋，那裏藏着他今天所領取的薪水，一疊不算很薄的鈔票－五百二十塊錢。『比上月多了一百二十塊呢；』心中的愉快」立刻化成了微笑掛上了他的嘴角。他心中在想：『這個月所加的薪水，先用來添置一件長衫罷，這些錢製新的果然不夠，但好在自己對於服飾向來馬虎，假使到衣莊上去掏取質地較差的舊衣，一定便宜得多，這樣大槪所差也有限了。雖然下個月因之又不免拮据一點，但直去就好了；根據這個月的結算，祇要每月有五百多塊錢的收益，非但不致再鬧虧空，而且假使能夠處處節省，還可以有些剩餘呢，雖然數目極小，但緊沙尙且可以成塔，這樣下去，不是也可以漸漸地恢復到以前幸福的生活嗎？想到這裏，馮先生眞覺得快活極了。迎面照耀着的太陽，發出炫目燦爛的光鄰，他想：「這不是象徵着自已正在一步步進走近着光明嗎？」於是愉悅的笑容又再度浮上了他的嘴角。</p>
<p>到家的時候，英兒正在默默地自個兒玩要，見了他父親，便飛也似地撲上身去，嘴裏還襲着：「爸爸，你薪水領了沒有？答應我買的木馬呢？」</p>
<p>「答應了當然買給你，今天晚了，過幾天去買吧。」因爲心中充溢着歡樂，說話的語氣也比平時更爲柔和了。</p>
<p>他的夫人知道他加了薪，也大大地歡喜了一陣，不消說他們這一頓晚餐是吃得萬分甘美的。</p>
<p>但是這美滿的預算，跟着日子的過去而逐漸破滅了。每天晚上記根的時候，馮先生深深地這樣覺得：「煤球每担漲了七元，麵粉漲了一倍多，食油漲兩』倍，醬油漲了三分之二，菜　漲了…肥皂漲了…糖　了！……」個月過去了，預算的長衫固沒有穿着，而那件　務却反送入了高櫃台的長生　裏去了。</p>
<p>『爸爸你書感我的木馬呢？』英兒每天豐着的要求，因失望於父親的不肯踐諾，近來也漸漸地疏淡了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">On National Health <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>"A strong nation must first have a strong people," which, in other words, means that improving "national health" is the most fundamental point that every nation and every country must strive for to stand in the world. If a nation is unhealthy, the country formed by this nation will inevitably be scattered and powerless. This is evident in the facts of strength and weakness of various countries in the world.</p>
<p>Stepping back to individual health, it is equally the key to the success or failure of one's career. "A sound career lies in a healthy body" has been correctly recognized by everyone. Therefore, for the sake of personal career, one must pay attention to health; for the sake of national career, one must pay even more attention to health. We must urge the people of our country to pay attention and place our aspiring country on top of a healthy nation.</p>
<p>The health of our Chinese nation, it must be admitted, has major problems. Foreigners ridicule us as "sick men of East Asia," which points out the unhealthiness of our nation. Since the Opium War, the trend of drug abuse has further harmed and damaged the health of our nation. Today, in the midst of great upheavals in the world, we must be vigilant about our national health and wash away the shame of being the "sick men of East Asia."</p>
<p>Our height and weight have comparative differences due to geographical distinctions. Northerners are relatively taller, and Southerners are relatively shorter. Expressed in numbers, the average statistics show that the height of men in the Yellow River basin is 66.6 inches, the height of men in the Yangtze River basin is 65 inches, and the height of men in the Pearl River basin is 64.1 inches. The proportion of weight also has roughly the same differences as above. However, when examining northerners for the air force, according to past statistics of the Chinese Air Force recruitment, the most Shandong people who passed only accounted for 15% to 20%. As far as able-bodied men are concerned, perhaps less than 40% meet the standards for military service. Before the Incident, there was once an examination of the physique of 230,000 students in major cities, and the results showed that more than 90% had shortcomings. In recent years, due to malnutrition and lack of medicine, generally speaking, national health is actually even lower, which is the first point that the people of the country should deeply guard against.</p>
<p>Several diseases that have been eradicated or reduced in modern countries with advanced health care and medicine are still spreading in China. First, tuberculosis. The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau once tested more than 1,000 students, and the results showed that 87% carried tuberculosis bacteria. The situation in various places now is probably also considerable. Second, cholera. Although epidemic prevention work is very diligent, it is biased towards cities, and it is still quite active in remote rural areas. Hospitals without infectious disease equipment are often at a loss in the face of the spread of infectious diseases. Third, trachoma. It has almost invaded every household. 41% of those who failed the Air Force exam were due to eye defects. Fourth, venereal diseases. The spread is very common. The existence of secret prostitutes in various places makes it impossible to eradicate the seeds of the disease. According to the experience of general doctors, more than half of the blood of pregnant women shows a positive reaction to syphilis. It is sometimes very difficult to hire a clean wet nurse. Fifth, malaria. This disease has been rampant in the southwestern provinces for a long time. Sixth, dysentery, and seventh, typhoid, also often arise in time and cause great harm. Although we do not have recent statistics at hand, the mortality rate after the Incident, especially the infant mortality rate, must have increased. Before the Incident, the mortality rate in China was high at 30 (30 deaths per year per 1,000 people), one or two times higher than in European and American countries. The infant mortality rate in China (within one year of age) was high at 200, four or five times higher than in European and American countries, and may be even higher now. Although death from disease is inevitable for human beings, the excessive suffering and extraordinary death not only cause countless losses in human and financial resources, but can even destroy a race and plunge a country into an abyss from which it is difficult to recover. This is the second point that the people of the country should deeply guard against.</p>
<p>There are many ways to be healthy, and there are several points that everyone can follow and practice:</p>
<p>(1) Pay attention to nutrition in food. On the Chinese menu, there is nothing more beautiful than satisfying the sense of taste. In the past, we often prided ourselves on food, occupying one-half of the world's kitchen. However, we don't know that there are major problems with this kitchen. We have not only eaten ourselves poor, but also eaten ourselves sick. In the future, we should pay attention to whether there is nutritional value in what we eat. Instead of pleasing the palate, we should seek to nourish life. The objects of eating may be lonely and simple, but the substances needed by the body must not be lacking. Although in this situation of high prices and difficult living, ordinary people are actually not full enough, let alone pleasing their palates, the nutritional value is not necessarily limited to expensive goods, and we must try to find substitutes as much as possible so that there are no deficiencies.</p>
<p>(2) Pay attention to exercise. Although there has been progress in exercise facilities and promotion in recent years, many people who lack the habit of physical labor still love morbid beauty. Outdoor exercises, morning calisthenics, swimming, etc. should all be promoted.</p>
<p>(3) Pay attention to cleanliness. We lack the habit of cleanliness. Generally, people often have the habit of spitting anywhere, not bathing diligently, and letting their clothes be greasy. They also have little training in the virtues of public health, such as randomly defecating along the river and on dark roadsides, and the stench evaporates.</p>
<p>(4) Absorb air and sunlight. When building houses and designing cities, a certain amount of space should be left to allow for fresh air and ample sunlight. People in cities should also go out to breathe fresh air and meet with sunlight more often.</p>
<p>(5) Have sufficient sleep to recover from fatigue.</p>
<p>(6) Have a happy mood so that the mind is broad and the body is at ease.</p>
<p>The above are all ordinary and practical ways to health. As for how to eradicate various epidemics and how to improve the national physique, some are related to medical issues, some are related to public health administration, some are related to health education and health projects, some are related to social policies, and some are related to school education, which cannot be fully explained in a short article. In order to reduce the population mortality rate and revive the efforts to serve the country, we solemnly propose today that the country must first make the nation healthy in order to move upward.</p>

<p>Rome, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a Madrid dispatch, the Spanish Ministry of the Navy, in view of widespread rumors that anti-Axis forces will land in the Balearic Islands, issued a statement on the 29th stating that a fleet of six Spanish destroyers, all of the 153-ton class, had set sail from Cartagena to Palma in Majorca. While the stated purpose of the fleet's dispatch is ostensibly for exercises, it is observed that this is a hasty measure taken to strengthen the defenses of the Balearic Islands due to the anti-Axis forces' desire to land there. It has recently been rumored that the anti-Axis forces harbor great ambitions for the Balearic Islands. After beginning the invasion of Sardinia, the anti-Axis forces will occupy the Balearic Islands, and it is said that their plan may be to make the islands a relay point for the supply route for the invasion of Sardinia. Given the various circumstances, the dispatch of the Spanish fleet is noteworthy.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to Havas, the British aircraft carrier "Audacious" and four destroyers arrived in Gibraltar yesterday from the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) - Havas relays a London dispatch stating that the Associated Press claims to have received news that Churchill arrived in Gibraltar yesterday afternoon en route to England. Furthermore, according to news from London last night, General Eisenhower, Commander-in-Chief of the anti-Axis forces in North Africa, arrived in Gibraltar yesterday with General Montgomery, commander of the British Eighth Army, and General Alexander, commander of the First Army.</p>
<p>Madrid, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) - A military correspondent for "ABC" newspaper claims that the British and Americans cannot launch large-scale offensives in East Asia and Europe simultaneously. The Allied Staff is well aware that an offensive on the European continent requires a vast supply organization, and manpower and material resources will suffer significant losses. Establishing a second front in Europe will deplete the Axis powers' fighting strength, and it seems that the United States does not want to concentrate its forces in Europe while having affairs in East Asia.</p>

<h3 id="e12">Japanese Troops on Attu Island Display Great Spirit; Overwhelmed, Entire Force Dies Heroically; Department Chief Yanagi Delivers Broadcast Speech <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 5:00 PM today: (1) Since engaging with American troops on the 12th of this month, the Japanese garrison on Attu Island has continued to fight bravely for many days under extremely difficult circumstances. On the night of the 29th, they decided to use all their strength to make a final and heroic attack on the enemy's main force, displaying the spirit of the Japanese army's bravery. After a long period of bloody battle, communication was suddenly completely cut off, which is believed to mean that all personnel have died heroically. Before this battle, all wounded and sick soldiers who could not engage in the attack all committed suicide in advance. The Japanese garrison on the island was led by Colonel Yasuyo Yamazaki and consisted of only 2,200 soldiers, while the enemy had special and excellent equipment and 20,000 soldiers. However, by the 28th of this month, the Japanese army had killed as many as 6,000 enemy soldiers. (2) Kiska Island (east of Attu Island) is still secured by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>Chief Yanagi Hanafusa, head of the Army Press Department of the Japanese General Headquarters, delivered a broadcast speech on the topic of "About the Bloody Battle of Attu Island" at 7:00 PM today regarding the battle situation on Attu Island announced by the General Headquarters today and the fierce fighting of the Japanese garrison on the island. The gist is as follows: The Japanese troops garrisoning Attu Island fought a bloody battle with the enemy for two days, and finally died heroically. Their heroic and courageous spirit is truly enough to shock even gods and spirits. The American troops who landed on Attu Island numbered 20,000, with tanks and excellent heavy weapons, and may have received considerable training in mountain and snow combat, and were protected by powerful fleets and air forces, so their strength was considerable. Our side had only about 2,000 soldiers led by Colonel Yasuyo Yamazaki, and were only equipped with a few artillery pieces, which created a situation of overwhelming disparity. When the enemy attacked from the sea, land, and air, they repeatedly attacked with fierce artillery fire, but our army carefully defended and seized opportunities to attack, separately defeating the enemy and inflicting heavy losses on them, and repelling them. Around the 27th of this month, the enemy gradually advanced towards our positions, and then launched a bayonet charge with knives and hand grenades. Even in this tragic and heroic situation, our unit commander Yamazaki never requested reinforcements or a single bullet. Such loyalty and courage that regarded death as home is admired by all. Furthermore, during the heat of battle, the enemy's formation, equipment, tactics, and the experiences and lessons learned in this battle, and the methods to be adopted in future battles were all recorded in detail and reported. There is a writing that says: "In this moment of artillery fire, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no crisis, and communication may also be cut off, so I have taken the opportunity to report in detail what I have observed." This strong sense of loyalty and great sense of responsibility can be said to be rare in the world. After days and nights of hard fighting, the morale of the Japanese army remained extremely strong, but as the number of dead and wounded continued to increase, by the 28th, only a few hundred people remained alive, while the enemy continued to replenish with new troops and strengthen their equipment. Colonel Yamazaki, observing the trend of the situation, resolutely made the final decision, that is, on the night of the 29th, he searched for the enemy's main force group and carried out the final attack. Those who were wounded or sick and unable to participate committed suicide before launching the attack. Colonel Yamazaki, after completing all the arrangements, reported the matter in detail to his superiors, saying: "We are aware that we should not be lucky in any way, and tarnish the reputation of a warrior, so we will die heroically with our subordinates in smiles." At the end of the report, the telegram was cut off. It is not difficult to imagine how tragic and courageous this final attack was. On May 27, American news commentator Hunt pointed out the difficulty of capturing Attu Island, saying that American Lieutenant General Hulzelm said that the Japanese army was strong, and all were courageous fighters who were determined to die. They are able to better demonstrate their characteristics in difficult situations, as evidenced by the situation on various Pacific fronts. Today, the Japanese army once again fought bravely on Attu Island. According to soldiers returning from the Southwest Pacific front, when fighting in a certain place, even if the Japanese army had only one soldier left, they still resisted fiercely with weapons. From this, it can be seen that it is difficult for the American army to suppress the Japanese army on Attu Island. The Japanese army's spirit of "do not win, do not return alive" is enough to chill the hearts of the American army. When the garrison troops decided to launch the final attack, they bowed to their homeland in the distance, shouted "Long live His Majesty the Great Marshal," and embraced righteousness in laughter.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Darwin Port Bombed <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to a telegram from New Gold Mountain, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Command announced on the 27th that Japanese air units bombed the eastern area of Darwin Port on the 27th, causing considerable damage to the area.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Britain and America Employ Familiar Tactics of Intimidation; Italy Remains Unmoved; Indiscriminate Bombing of Innocents Increases Italian People's Hatred; Germany Claims Retaliatory Raids Will Be Launched Against Britain <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Rome, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to Havas, Roman political figures believe that the speech given by British Foreign Secretary Eden in Portsmouth the day before was a general threat by Britain and America against Italy. This familiar tactic of Britain and America is actually a result of failing to understand the morale of the Italian people. To accompany the threatening remarks in British and American newspapers and wireless broadcasts with real air raids only serves to increase the Italian people's hatred. The Axis powers' air raids specifically target cities and not military facilities, so their effect is merely to intimidate Italy. However, the Italian people will not be discouraged by this. Eden's claim that Italy bullied France, which lacked the power to defend itself, is absurd. When Italy entered the war, it should be known that France had concentrated well-equipped elite troops on its southwestern border. Conversely, what excuse can Britain and America give for the British attack on Diego Garcia and Madagascar and the joint British and American invasion of French North Africa?</p>
<p>Rome, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) - Stefani news agency claims: The enemy's bombing of Afragola on Friday was yet another horrific act of destroying residential areas and slaughtering nuns and children. In this atrocity, many palaces and residences were almost completely destroyed, and nurses and children in two maternity hospitals were bombed to death. Three churches were destroyed, and one children's hospital was also bombed. Countless bodies of nurses and children were unearthed. The Italian King and Prime Minister, as well as the Minister of Public Works, inspected the disaster area within hours of the incident and offered comfort to the victims.</p>
<p>Rome, 30th (Central News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>It was revealed here last night that the number of children who died in the recent anti-Axis air raid on Calabria has increased from 33 to 54. In addition, 14 nannies were killed, and other civilians and students also died in this attack. When the anti-Axis air force attacked Foggia, they strafed farmers and livestock in the fields with machine guns.</p>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>The German military authorities recently expressed their opinions on the British planes' indiscriminate bombing of Germany, stating briefly that after the start of the war, Führer Hitler suggested to the Anti-Axis side that they mutually refrain from bombing civilians, but they refused to accept and answered with bombing. The German side then gave a warning that if they did not change their ways, Germany would retaliate, waiting for Britain to reflect. Germany has endured for a long time, but they remain the same as before. The situation of their bombing is exactly the same as at the beginning of the war, so in the near future, German planes will carry out retaliatory bombing.</p>

<p>Budapest, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) - Hungarian Prime Minister Kallay declared in a cabinet meeting last night that the main purpose of Hungarian foreign policy is to safeguard the national survival of Hungary. He stated that Hungary is a reliable and valuable ally in the European war, and faithfully fulfills its obligations. Although the Hungarian army suffered losses in the fighting on the Eastern Front, it is of great value and effectiveness from the standpoint of Hungary's national position. Hungarian soldiers are dedicating themselves to Christian culture and European culture. The Hungarian Prime Minister also discussed the recent dissolution of Parliament, saying that he had to take this measure to prevent radical elements from using inappropriate remarks to prevent Parliament from having a peaceful discussion. The Hungarian Prime Minister also severely criticized Hungarian exiles, saying that no one in the country follows them, and they are merely being used by foreigners. He strongly stated that Hungary respects the rights of all ethnic groups. He pointed out that Hungary wants to live in peace with Slovakia and Croatia, and is now doing its best to eliminate disputes. Hungary is faithfully in love with Germany and Italy. The Italian Prime Minister and the German Führer both helped Hungary to lift the shackles of the Treaty of Trianon. Only the German Führer can protect Europe from the threat of the Soviet Union. Domestically, Hungary does not have a People's Front, and any attempt to organize a People's Front will be immediately stopped.</p>

<p>— Kimura Shohachi</p>
<p>On the second day of the naval battle of the Sea of Japan, when Rear Admiral Nebogatov led his fleet to surrender, Admiral Togo continued to bombard the enemy's ranks non-stop. An aide standing beside him saw this situation and said: "Sir, the enemy has already raised the white flag." It is said that Admiral Togo's answer was: "I know, don't you see that the enemy ships are still moving?" One truly feels the crisp side of the Navy Soul. Later, when Admiral Togo accepted the five surrendered cruisers, he allowed enemy officers above the rank of officer to wear swords. This picture is based on a sketch of Admiral Togo on the "Mikasa" at that time, and was changed to one in the wind and rain. In reality, Admiral Togo had to stand firmly in the "clear weather" at all times. (Tao: Translated from Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<h3 id="e17">The Soviet Army Disregards Heavy Casualties, Fiercely Attacks the Southern Triangle Stronghold; Both Sides Deploy Powerful Land and Air Forces in a Fierce Battle for the Kupensk Bridgehead <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Eastern Front, stretching 2,800 kilometers from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea coast, includes approximately 1,800 kilometers from Novorossiysk to Leningrad and about 1,000 kilometers on the Finnish front. On this vast front, in recent days, the German and Soviet armies have become increasingly active, centering around the Kupensk area, the middle reaches of the Donets River, the Leningrad area, and Torez.  The entire line feels exceptionally tense. Although the two armies are currently engaged in fierce fighting only in the Kupensk bridgehead, they are fully prepared on all other fronts, waiting for opportunities. Where this summer offensive will be launched first remains unpredictable but is unlikely to unfold unexpectedly. According to German sources, in recent days, the Soviet forces, disregarding heavy casualties, have repeatedly attacked the German triangular stronghold. This stronghold is defined by a base approximately 100 kilometers long, stretching from the Kerch Peninsula to Novorossiysk, held by the German forces, with the other two sides being the German positions in the direction of the Kupensk bridgehead, measuring 80 kilometers and 65 kilometers respectively. This Soviet move aims to seize the German foothold in the Kakhovka area to prepare fully for the summer offensive. Simultaneously, they are attempting to retake the Sevastopol and Novorossiysk naval ports on the Black Sea side. However, the German perspective seems to be that while the Kupensk bridgehead has considerable strategic value, it holds no particular importance when considering the entire Eastern Front. The strategic value of the Kupensk bridgehead differs for the Soviet and German armies, which is noteworthy. However, based on the combat situation in the past few days, both the German and Soviet armies have deployed powerful land and air forces in intense battles. For example, on the 28th, 56 Soviet aircraft were shot down over the Taman Peninsula. Local well-informed sources claim that the situation on the Kupensk front is related to the summer offensive, and its progress is highly significant.</p>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) – Colonel Hama, a military correspondent for the German News Agency, stated that the distinctive feature of the large-scale defensive battle at the Kupensk bridgehead on the 28th was the great victory of the German Air Force in attacking the advancing Soviet forces. German bombers and dive bombers continuously attacked Soviet rifle regiments and tank columns throughout the day, inflicting heavy damage. By the afternoon, the Soviet forces had penetrated the German lines in some areas, reaching the peak of the battle. Subsequently, a German reserve grenadier company launched a fierce counterattack, resulting in hand-to-hand combat, destroying 12 Soviet tanks, while another 16 were destroyed by the German Air Force. The main Soviet pressure was applied to the German positions east of Kupyansk and Moldavske. According to German military sources, the Soviet command, having failed in its attempt to break through the German lines three days ago, is now adopting a strategy of large-scale attrition warfare. However, given the losses suffered by the Soviet forces, this plan is unlikely to succeed. Despite the Soviet forces having ten times more personnel and weapons than the German forces, they have achieved nothing so far. The Soviet army suffered repeated setbacks in the first three weeks of this month, so the intention to capture Novorossiysk has apparently been abandoned. In the salt lake area near Temryuk, the Soviet forces launched another attack, surrounding the German defensive positions. Fortunately, the German forces had already anticipated their intentions, so they broke the encirclement after a short engagement. German Air Force bombers attacked concentrated Soviet ships in the same area, sinking a total of 16 fully loaded landing craft. On Friday, the Soviet side also dispatched a strong air force to bomb German supply lines. As a result of several air battles, German fighters shot down 46 Soviet aircraft over the Taman Peninsula, while another 10 were shot down by Slovakian aircraft. On other sections of the Eastern Front, only the area northeast of Lysychansk in the middle Donets region saw major battles, where the Soviet forces repeatedly launched attacks on German-held high ground, with several rifle regiments and powerful tank forces joining the operation. This ineffective attempt ceased in the evening. Soviet assault troops in the central sector were quite active, and Soviet artillery fire in front of Leningrad was extremely heavy, which may be a prelude to an offensive by the Soviet forces in that area.

<h3 id="e20">What I Have Seen of the United States <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The following is the gist of a speech given by Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura, the Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the United States, at a commemorative lecture hosted by the Kyoto Prefecture National Defense Association and the Kyoto Prefecture Branch of the Naval Association on Navy Day, and sponsored by the Kyoto Shimbun, the Mainichi Shimbun, and the Asahi Shimbun.</p>
<p>"Roosevelt's America," following in the footsteps of Wilson, pursues a grand global policy, unwilling to confine itself to the American continent. It insists on the Open Door Policy and the principle of equal opportunity in China, viewing the 400 million Chinese people as a funnel for selling their goods. Therefore, it does not approve of "Asia for Asians" and is determined to instigate conflict between China and Japan to undermine Japan's power. The American people now seem to have accepted this grand imperial ambition of the United States, but some still harbor isolationist ideas. If they suffer further defeats, public opinion may become divided to some extent. Roosevelt is well aware of this situation. The British Prime Minister also stated in the American Congress a few days ago the importance of not engaging in a prolonged war. America's attitude towards the war is rapidly becoming totalitarian. Their war aims remain those defined during neutrality in the "Atlantic Charter." In the Far East, due to repeated and devastating defeats in the ongoing war, they want to concentrate all their power in the Far East. That is why Churchill hastily flew to the United States, wanting to prevent America from retreating from the Atlantic.</p>
<p>After the Casablanca Conference earlier this year, Roosevelt, military officials, and politicians unanimously declared, "We will not rest until the enemy surrenders unconditionally." The recent Washington Conference seems to be vigorously discussing whether to focus on the Eastern Front or the Western Front. I have always pointed out that America still maintains a "Europe First" policy, while those within America insist that the Pacific should be given equal consideration with the Atlantic, not treated as secondary. They say, "Our enemies are the same, both in the East and the West." Currently, the main forces of the U.S. Army and Navy are in the Pacific, and the Air Force also places importance on this area. American public opinion polls show that 30% believe Germany is the primary enemy, while 60% believe Japan is. During World War I, one-third of the national budget was spent on the war; this time, it has reached 89%. During World War I, daily war expenses were $40 million; this time, they are $100 million per day, and recently even reached $250 million. The amount used for the Navy is enormous, so they also say, "This war will not be abandoned halfway."</p>
<p>We should fully understand this current situation, and this is precisely why Prime Minister Tojo's so-called "grand strategy" is necessary. So, what exactly does America plan to do in East Asia in the future? They are not preparing to engage in a decisive battle with a large fleet like the Battle of the Sea of Japan but are focusing on air warfare. Because of the failure of the Doolittle Raid on Japan last April, Japan has geographical advantages, so they are planning to seize locations near Japan as air bases. The movements in the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, Midway Island, the Aleutian Islands, and mainland China are manifestations of this. India and the coastal region of Siberia are also under consideration. Stalin is very cautious about the coastal region, so we must be vigilant. At the same time, they are rapidly catching up in terms of improving the quality of aircraft, enhancing air combat capabilities, and training air force soldiers. America considers air warfare more important than ordinary warships, focusing all its efforts on aircraft carriers, which is evident from the allocation of personnel. Next, regarding submarine warfare, because oil tankers in the Atlantic were being heavily sunk by German submarines, they are also emulating Germany and adopting submarine warfare tactics, passing a large submarine construction bill in Congress, aiming to threaten Japan's surroundings. The resources of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere are transported by ships, so Japan should urgently seek ways to strengthen various combat capabilities to counter the enemy's intentions. Whether this war will be long or short is still uncertain, but I believe a long-term war posture is absolutely necessary. The key to war is to maintain a superior advantage over the enemy in the decisive battle, in order to defeat the enemy. Therefore, 100 million people should unite both on the front lines and in the rear, to overwhelm the enemy.</p>
<p>Next year is an election year. No matter how great an actor is, from the prologue to the end, constantly appearing on stage will eventually become tiresome. Roosevelt also seems to be gradually worried about losing popular support, but we must not be negligent because of the enemy's weaknesses. We should intensify our efforts to build strength and move towards the final victory. (Transcribed from the May 28th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<p>Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>A BBC correspondent in New York declared yesterday that President Roosevelt's establishment of the War Mobilization Bureau is equivalent to a large-scale cabinet reshuffle. Roosevelt's unavoidable adoption of this severe step is due to the increasingly sharp attacks from employers on the authorities' management methods and the growing spread of strikes nationwide. The leader of this new bureau, Byrnes, will use harsh measures to avoid similar situations in the future. At the same time, the U.S. Office of War Information stated that President Roosevelt's establishment of the War Mobilization Bureau will allow him to focus on international policy and military issues in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Stanley Resolute in His Intention to Resign <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Huitong News Agency, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Admiral Stanley, repeatedly had his letters to President Roosevelt ignored. Most recently, Roosevelt sent a letter to Stalin via Davies instead of the ambassador. His determination to resign is now stronger than ever. This information was "obtained from well-informed sources" by the New York Times' correspondent in Washington yesterday. The correspondent said that Stanley also complained to President Roosevelt that American agencies and organizations within the Soviet Union all report directly to their respective U.S. departments, rather than through the ambassador. Therefore, the position of ambassador to the Soviet Union is essentially redundant.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>According to New York, the New York Times' special correspondent in Washington stated that U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Major General Stanley, dissatisfied with the circumstances of his position, has expressed his intention to resign to President Roosevelt. However, Secretary of State Hull said that he was unaware of Stanley's intention to resign. According to the New York Times, Stanley told President Roosevelt that he felt that Davies' carrying President Roosevelt's letter to Stalin was a disregard for his position. Therefore, his intention to resign is even more determined. Stanley also said that reports from various American agencies in the Soviet Union are submitted directly to their respective U.S. departments, rather than being relayed through the ambassador. Therefore, his mission in the Soviet Union has become redundant.</p>
<h3 id="e25">London March for Indian Independence Intervened by Police <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>According to London, the march organized yesterday by the Indian Independence Movement Committee here was intervened by the police and could not be held. Five or six thousand people participated in the march, including Mr. Brockway, the chairman of the aforementioned committee. According to Brockway's remarks to visiting journalists afterwards, Home Secretary Morrison had confirmed that the ban on the march was based on London's regulations prohibiting all political marches. However, the rally convened by the committee in Trafalgar Square was not dispersed. Member of Parliament Cove gave a speech, saying that the first step to liberating India was to release Nehru and Gandhi, the two members of the Indian Congress Working Committee. Today's terrible tragedy is that Britain's promises have lost credibility in India. Indian independence must be realized, and the British people must never subdue it by force alone. The soul of India has been awakened and will never fall asleep again. Other speakers included novelist and Member of Parliament Manning Makston and Brockway.

<p>— Tokutomi Iichirō</p>
<p>Continued from the 20th of this newspaper</p>
<p>(8) Individualism of the Head of State</p>
<p>Edward VIII did not possess extraordinary talents. He had heard everything, seen everything, met all kinds of people, and experienced all sorts of situations, all of which were disproportionate to his age. His knowledge was merely like a camera, capturing fragmentary scenes, without special expertise in any particular area. He had no deep thoughts, no self-reflection, no worries, and no melancholy. He spent his leisurely years happily, laughingly, casually, and recklessly. In his youth, he participated in World War I, earning commendation for his bravery in actual combat. In short, he disliked formality and loved to break the mold. His daily life was always off track. Therefore, he was extremely popular with the working class, lacking the solemnity of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria. Many believed he would succeed his grandfather Edward VII.</p>
<p>Moreover, he had traveled around the world, exaggerating that Britain was the only major exporter of goods. He thought everyone else thought that way too. He went everywhere winning people over. When he visited Japan, it was just when the Washington Naval Treaty was signed in April of the eleventh year of the Taisho era. We have no other deep impressions left, but we remember that the news at the time recorded that on the way from Nikko to Chuzenji, the Crown Prince put on a worker's uniform at a teahouse, told his attendants to ride in rickshaws, and pulled them himself as a rickshaw driver, and we even saw a photo of that scene. The Crown Prince of a great empire that owns one-third of the world's land and one-quarter of the world's population, one cannot say that this was just a momentary whim; everyone must have felt that way!</p>
<p>The Crown Prince performed various out-of-the-ordinary actions everywhere. Once, he reportedly fell off a horse and broke his skull, which became a problem for the parliament.</p>
<p>He was born in 1894, ascended the throne in 1936, and abdicated 325 days later on December 11 of the same year. This is the so-called Mrs. Simpson affair. There have been many accounts of this matter in the world. But we are definitely not interested in those accounts. Moreover, this matter is already in the past, and he is living a life of pleasure as the Duke of Windsor. However, the reason we bring it up is that when we talk about the collapse of England, we cannot overlook this kind of event. How deeply individualism permeated the minds of the British people and the British monarch is powerful evidence. With the emergence of this kind of event, it is difficult for the British to use loyalty to the royal family to understand each other and believe it is a force that maintains the British Empire.</p>
<p>The Crown Prince had three brothers, and two of them were already married, but his eldest brother, the Crown Prince, was still single, which was incredible. Given the position of a Crown Prince, if he wanted to marry, his candidates would certainly be sought from a royal court or noble family. However, unexpectedly, the Simpson affair occurred.</p>
<p>It is generally said that Mrs. Simpson was of Jewish descent, and that may be true. In any case, that woman was born in Baltimore, USA. Her name was Wallis Warfield. At the age of adulthood, she married U.S. Navy Lieutenant Spencer and also traveled to Shanghai and Beijing. For some unknown reason, she divorced the young Navy aviation officer Sessell, and soon became close to a so-called Simpson. Simpson was a married man who, without any reason, divorced his original wife and married that woman. His job was as an agent for Simpson Shipping Company, and he lived in London.</p>
<p>Soon, the Simpsons and the Crown Prince hit it off, and the Crown Prince personally drove his car from nightclubs to take the Simpsons home. Moreover, according to the records in the palace, the Crown Prince often invited the Simpsons to dinner, which surprised everyone, wondering why such obscure people were receiving such preferential treatment from the Crown Prince. Soon, the records of the palace affairs no longer mentioned the Simpsons, but only Mrs. Simpson alone being invited along with other well-known people. Even more strangely, when the Crown Prince traveled to the Mediterranean coast, she became his traveling companion, and they even went to a winter sports resort in the Tyrol Mountains together. Wherever the Crown Prince went, Mrs. Simpson was always like a shadow, and her name was always mentioned. Therefore, the Crown Prince's travels were not subject to any formal invitations because of his travels with Mrs. Simpson, which aroused a lot of criticism.</p>
<p>Then, photos of the two shopping in the streets near the Mediterranean coast were published without restraint in American newspapers. People's comments on him spread from nearby places to the United States and even to colonies far from the motherland.</p>
<p>At this time, George V passed away on January 21, 1936. The Crown Prince ascended the throne as Edward VIII. The most surprising thing to the world after he became emperor was that in August of that year, when the emperor traveled on the "Nahlin" along the Adriatic Sea in the Mediterranean, Mrs. Simpson unexpectedly participated. During this trip, there was no way for the British Emperor to receive personal invitations, so he broke with tradition, and the Hungarian government invited Edward VIII and Mrs. Simpson.</p>
<p>By October of that year, the news of Wallis Simpson's divorce lawsuit gradually spread. Mrs. Simpson accused her husband, Ernest Simpson, of violating her chastity, and filed a divorce lawsuit. After six months, Mrs. Simpson's divorce was finalized, and she gained the freedom to marry anyone.</p>
<p>By December 1936, it caused a great uproar. Although all the news magazines remained silent on this matter, the parliament raised this matter as an issue. At the time, the American news king Hearst happened to be at his Welsh mansion in England, where he met with the Emperor's auxiliary secretary Thomas, learned the details, and immediately sent a telegram across the Atlantic to the Pacific coast. The telegram said:</p>
<p>"Mrs. Ernest Simpson of Baltimore will obtain a divorce permit within a few months and will marry King Edward VIII of England eight months later."</p>
<p>The matter has come to this point, and it cannot be ignored. The parliament then formally discussed this matter.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Baldwin met with the Emperor several times to discuss this matter, but he could not change the Emperor's decision. It goes without saying that the Queen Mother Mary repeatedly advised the Emperor. Mrs. Simpson declared: "I have no intention of interfering with any of the Emperor's decisions," meaning that even if the Emperor canceled the marriage agreement, she would have no objection. However, the Emperor had the intention to marry from the beginning and would rather give up the throne to marry. He did not want Mrs. Simpson to be treated as a queen. He wanted to ensure that the children they would have would not be counted in the royal succession system in order to end this situation. However, there was no precedent for this in Britain, and it did not work out in the end.</p>
<p>In individualistic England, many people sympathized with this matter, saying, "The Emperor insists on carrying out his will." Some people in parliament also said: "Is this not the King's personal matter? We have no room to intervene," wanting to gloss over this matter.</p>
<p>We are not making any criticism of Edward VIII in our personal capacity. But if we think about what the Emperor's duties are, then we should have reflected before this final stalemate came. However, he did not reflect, and the world did not reflect on this either. Many people regarded it as nothing strange, letting it pass like clouds and flowing water. From one point of view, it is a pragmatic and expedient country, and from another point of view, it is a thoroughly individualistic country. At the same time, it is also a question of whether this kind of action has the power to unite the British Commonwealth. The Chinese have a saying: "Driving six horses tied with a rotten rope," which is similar to this situation. So, what else can defend and prevent the collapse of the British Empire? Stuck in a dilemma, the only thing to rely on is the United States. However, this is just a frog jumping into the mouth of a venomous snake.

<h3 id="e29">Both Concessions Will Begin Universal Checks for Epidemic Prevention Certificates Tomorrow; Citizens Should Carry Certificates with Them <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The health authorities of both concessions have decided to commence, from tomorrow, universal checks for epidemic prevention certificates within the concession areas, in conjunction with the police and Baojia [self-defense units]. It is hoped that citizens who have already been vaccinated will carry their epidemic prevention certificates with them at all times for inspection. Those who have not yet been vaccinated should quickly go to the nearest health clinic or Baojia joint vaccination station to get vaccinated, to avoid various troubles during inspections. The certificate inspection work starting tomorrow will largely involve setting up partial obstacles on important streets, manned by police or Baojia personnel. Pedestrians passing through must present their epidemic prevention certificates; those without certificates will be forcibly vaccinated.</p>
<p>Vaccination Numbers Have Decreased. According to personnel from epidemic prevention vaccination teams at intersections of major roads in both concessions, speaking to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, seven or eight out of ten pedestrians currently passing by already have vaccination certificates, so the number of people receiving vaccinations is not very crowded. As for the Baojia area joint vaccination stations, the number of people receiving vaccinations daily has also decreased significantly recently. The reason, it is said, is that the majority of residents in these areas have already been vaccinated.</p>
<p>Entertainment Venues Restrict Visitors</p>
<p>At the same time, according to a Datong News Agency reporter's investigation, in order to maintain public health during the hot season, the French Concession authorities, in addition to cooperating with their two municipal districts to implement a plan to disperse beggars from the streets, have also ordered cinemas, theaters, and amusement parks within the concession to enact prohibitions, refusing entry to those with tattered clothing or skin diseases, in order to prevent infection.</p>
<h3 id="e30">"Canary" Charity Performance to Help with Disaster Relief <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Our newspaper is receiving donations for disaster relief in North China. We are grateful for the generous contributions from all sectors. Yesterday, we received a letter from the Lihua Theater and the China Traveling Theater Troupe, which stated: "We feel the urgent need to help disaster victims in North China. As the first response from the drama community, we have decided to hold a charity performance of 'Canary' on June 3rd (Thursday) during the daytime. That day would originally be the forty-seventh day of 'Canary's' performance, and according to regulations, there would be a day off and no performance during the daytime. However, our staff does not want to be idle and is willing to go on stage for all the disaster victims in North China, fulfilling our responsibility to 'contribute our strength.' Tickets are divided into three types: 200 yuan, 100 yuan, and 50 yuan. Presales will begin immediately at the box office. The ticket revenue, excluding expenses, will be entirely sent to your newspaper for allocation on June 4th. We sincerely hope that all sectors will contribute generously. We are writing this letter in advance and kindly request that you publish it for publicity. We are immensely grateful." We are thankful for their enthusiasm for disaster relief and extend our sincere gratitude to the disaster victims in North China on their behalf. The total amount of donations received yesterday will be compiled and published tomorrow. We hope that all those who donated will note this.</p>

<p>Ms. Su Yizhi, a teacher at Sacred Heart Elementary School in Hongkou, was unreasonably beaten and humiliated by a student's parents and died of shame and indignation. All sectors expressed indignation and, in addition to sending condolences, sent letters expressing their outrage and upholding justice. Excerpts from the original letters are as follows: (1) Letter from Sheng Peidong and others: "Ms. Su Yizhi, a female teacher at Sacred Heart Elementary School, deeply understood the importance of her duties. She punished misbehaving students, which was a manifestation of her loyalty to her duties and is admirable and commendable. However, the parents of the punished student not only did not appreciate this but also beat and humiliated her, leading to her suicide. This is an extremely tragic event in the world. We believe that on the one hand, the deceased should be fully compensated and commended. On the other hand, we should loudly call for improving the treatment of all teachers serving in national education, especially elementary and secondary school teachers. In this time of high rice and firewood prices, who would be willing to take on this arduous task? We respectfully submit 3,000 yuan for funeral expenses and request that you find a way to transfer it to Ms. Su Yizhi's family. - Respectfully submitted by Sheng Peidong, Hu Xigan, Chen Xuejian, Shao Jingfu, Chen Pengxian, Zhou Buyu." (2) Letter from Guoqiang Elementary School: "Elementary school education is the lifeblood of the nation, and elementary school teachers only hope for the success of their students' studies. Parents should respect teachers, but these parents were ignorant. It is truly lamentable. If they are not severely punished, what hope is there for the future of education? We have collectively raised 600 yuan and request that it be transferred to the deceased's family. We also hope that people from all sectors will uphold justice." (3) Letter from Yan Ziying: "Your newspaper reported that Ms. Su Yizhi, a teacher at Sacred Heart School, died of shame and indignation after being beaten and humiliated by a student's parents. Society is filled with indignation. I am now submitting 100 yuan and request that you send condolences to her family on my behalf."</p>

<p>Zhou Lingshu, a renowned master of Chinese music, arrived in Shanghai on the 29th of this month. Taking advantage of his presence in Shanghai, a reporter visited Mr. Zhou yesterday (the 30th, morning) and was granted an audience. Mr. Zhou delivered a grand discourse on advocating the Way of Confucius and Chinese music, stating: "Our respect and admiration for ancient culture should not be limited to form; we should study its principles, select those aspects of ancient learning that are suitable for modern needs, and promote them. Those that are not suitable should be preserved. We should not forget ancient culture because of the times. Both sides must be incorporated for the revival of Chinese culture to be achieved." He also stated: "The use of rituals is to provide external models of propriety, while the function of music is to harmonize and regulate our inner hearts. Therefore, rituals and music must be given equal importance and practiced together. If we want our country to be strong, we must first promote the Way of Confucius, revive our inherent culture, and advocate Chinese music." He further stated that the difference between the Duke of Zhou and Confucius is that the Duke of Zhou invented and created the principles of learning, while Confucius organized and compiled them into a great synthesis. Therefore, we should use the spirit and methods of Confucius to study ancient Confucianism in our country, adapt it to the current global environment, and seek the revival of our country's culture.</p>

<p>Stabilizing people's livelihoods lies in reducing the burden of people's lives. Reducing the burden on people lies in suppressing the prices of daily necessities. This is a perfectly clear plan. Even those who are not economic scholars deeply understand this meaning.</p>
<p>Recently, it has been heard that the highest authorities will use four countermeasures as the basis for implementing economic control: unifying the organizational structure of industry and commerce, vigorously implementing the evaluation system, promoting the development of trade and transportation in various regions, and maximizing the production efficiency of Chinese and Japanese factories and enterprises. It can be said that none of these countermeasures are not essential measures to relieve or reduce people's fear of life, and what we believe is the most suitable method for the current urgent remedy is none other than the vigorous implementation of the evaluation system.</p>
<p>We have repeatedly said that the first key to solving the current price problem is to seek the rationalization of prices; to give the most reasonable calculation to the cost and profit of manufacturers, and then, based on this calculation, to set the most reasonable price, so that the wholesalers and retailers of various commodities can maintain their proper profit, and there is no excuse to raise prices. Therefore, they will have to understand and carry out their normal and proper transactions under the evaluation method. Therefore, the vigorous implementation of the evaluation system is the best way to solve the price problem at present.</p>
<p>However, in all matters, the method of governance and the people being governed are equally important; once an evaluation system has been established, there must be evaluation personnel; therefore, the organization of evaluation personnel is the prerequisite for the vigorous implementation of the evaluation system. We feel that the ideal standard for selecting evaluation personnel should be based on their actual experience and knowledge of the commercial conditions of various commodities, and not merely on their position and reputation in the industrial and commercial community, because reputation is one thing, and practical experience and practical knowledge are another.</p>

Regarding call loans, they are handled in accordance with the revised call loan regulations. It was learned yesterday that each bank and store is providing property as collateral to apply for call loans. The following items are limited: (1) Government bonds, based on 70% of the Reserve Fund's evaluation. (2) Stocks and bonds of Chinese companies, based on 30% of the Reserve Fund's evaluation. (3) Real estate with income in the urban area of Shanghai, whose ownership has been approved and registered by the authorities, based on 50% of the Reserve Fund's evaluation. (4) Reserve Fund's official receipts and treasury certificates, based on 100% of the face value.

The term of the call loan is set at ten days, but it may be repaid early.

<h3 id="e46">The Economic Shanghai Construction Committee Held Its First Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The Economic Shanghai Construction Committee, newly established within the Chamber of Commerce, held its first committee meeting at the Japan Club at noon on the 29th. Consul General Yano (Deputy Consul Tanaka) and Deputy Consul Morita attended and provided guidance. In addition to Chairman Aoki and Executive Director Takeuchi, 29 other committee members attended the meeting. First, Chairman and Committee Chairman Aoki stood up and delivered a speech, followed by a speech by the representative of Consul General Yano, who stated: "Shanghai is the economic center of all of China. Without the economy of Central China, the economy of North China cannot be used smoothly. Shanghai is the heart of the economy of all of China, and its position is extremely important. The development of Japan's policy toward China, grasping the hearts of the people and economic construction, takes this as its goal. As for its promotion methods, in the past, it was always guided by the Japanese side. From now on, this policy will be promoted with the Chinese side as the center. The Japanese side will guide the Japanese economic community in accordance with the ideals of the Greater East Asia. At this important time, the new establishment of three committees by the Chamber of Commerce can be said to be timely and deeply gratifying. It is hoped that all committee members will contribute proposals for Shanghai's economic construction at any time and cooperate to complete the new policy." Then, Executive Director Takeuchi proposed that small committees be set up for the industrial and financial sectors, which have the basic conditions for economic Shanghai construction. The entire venue unanimously agreed and passed the proposal. The list of committee members for the two small committees will be selected by Chairman Aoki. During the meeting, issues such as labor, industry, and the economic division of labor between China and Japan were also discussed, with industry and finance as the focus. It was also decided that if necessary during the process, other committees may be established. It is also heard that the members of the small committees will be appointed by the chairman in the next day or two, and it is planned to convene a small paper committee next week. It is also planned to determine the secretary of the committee at the same time as the small committee members. (Yunpeng: Translated from the Mainland News on May 30).</p>

Yellow gold fell consistently at the beginning of the week, but then recovered due to enthusiastic absorption, but it was still 100 to 200 yuan lower than the limited price. The quoted price for buying and selling transactions in silver shops changed very little. The market price of patterned silver was unchanged. The interest rate for call loans among Qian Zhuang [traditional Chinese banks] started at two jiao. Discounting of bills was flat. Chinese stocks were sometimes weak and sometimes strong. Public bonds changed little. The market price of yarn and cloth fell. The Municipal Council's officially set prices for various food items, such as grains, flours, and miscellaneous grains, remained unchanged as usual.

<p>— Jin Jiang</p>
<p>Hunching our backs all day, huddling up in the light of electric lamps, for six years, our lives have been spent like this. But what we have encountered is beyond expectation. Now, let us take advantage of this small corner of precious land to make a happy yet painful moan!</p>
<p>(I) This is a printing house, since the war, the number of partners has been reduced from more than ten to four. Such work is distributed to the four of us who are neither beast nor man. To eat, who dares to say no?</p>
<p>(II) What about our meals? It's laughable. Each meal has only a pot of green vegetables. Not to mention that the rice has turned into congee, and the congee has become non-pure rice congee. We must exert the greatest labor, and we get the worst reward. But we don't resent these things - This is an emergency - the owner said.</p>
<p>But the owner keeps three wives, more than twenty children, and male and female servants. They live in delicacies every day. For six years, a pot of green vegetables and congee are our lives. For six years, four companions have been doing the work of more than ten partners, playing the sad song of life. I wonder when we can change our lives and move towards the light!</p>

<p>— Shi Ting</p>
<p>Along the vast path of the setting sun, strolling by the creek. The evening breeze gently ruffles our messy hair, containing a strong earthy smell, and the biting spring cold has disappeared. Spring has just come, and then it suddenly leaves. Spring here is so short! I can't help but sigh.</p>
<p>The sunset fades the bright colors, gray-blue, dark purple... quietly floating in the sky, are the crows returning from foraging, calling aimlessly on the treetops, looking for their home. Mothers lengthen their slightly hoarse voices, calling out to the children playing in the wild.</p>
<p>The early summer evening is filled with dreamlike mystery and tranquility, as poets have sung. Even in this chaotic and war-torn year, the early summer evening is still dreamlike, mysterious and tranquil? The turbid stream flows, flows... calmly, without the rapid swirling whirlpools, the splashing of water! The rusty barbed wire, the wooden frame is mostly tilted, still tightly wrapped around the creek, and some broken wires tremble slightly in the evening breeze. The wilderness seems to endure the shackles on his body forever, bear the scars all over, and stretch on the other side of the creek; the broken tiles cling to the ruins, the buildings emptied of people open their wounded eyes, dimly facing the setting sun. For years, it has been so desolate and desolate. During the day, some farmers silently cultivate their vegetable fields by the creek. Now, there are only groups of rice carriers shuttling through the ruins, flashing hurried shadows. I heard that the price of rice has become cheaper in the past two days. Many rice sellers on the street come to the door, but no one wants it. But listening to their shouts, the tone is always light, without sadness or resentment...</p>
<p>The early summer evening here is filled with mystery and tranquility, depressed mystery and tranquility.</p>
<p>We hummed the words "The cold and clear sunset, with only a willow tree bending over".</p>
<p>"Do you have any change? A begging child!" Suddenly, touched my arm and quickened his pace.</p>
<p>I followed his gaze: an eight or nine-year-old child, dragging ill-fitting broken shoes, followed from the left. It seemed that there was no possibility of avoiding him. I groped in my pocket, thinking: "I don't have any change, what a mess!"</p>
<p>But unexpectedly, he didn't come to beg. The stubborn hand that was expected to be stretched out to beg straightened his skewed collar. He stared at us for a while and asked, "Uncle! Is this Caishi Road?"</p>
<p>I looked around in confusion: such a young child, with weak legs dragging those wide broken shoes, groping towards Caishi Road in the hazy dusk.</p>
<p>"Little brother! What are you doing on Caishi Road? It's still far from Caishi Road!"</p>
<p>He seemed to have lost something, staring at my face, and then glancing around in disappointment: "Looking for Mom! She hasn't been home for three days!"</p>
<p>Looking for mom? Not home for three days? Prostitute? Or committed suicide? ... I was immediately drawn to the fate of this strange child, and looked in surprise at C beside me, who was staring blankly at the child's face. Maybe he was also imagining the child's home: a dark little house, a sick father...</p>
<p>"What does your mom do? Why hasn't she been home for three days?" I gently patted his shoulder.</p>
<p>"Mom?" He raised his dry eyelids and wiped the eye mucus with his hand: "She carries rice. The day before yesterday morning, she cooked porridge for us, and then she went out. She said to my brother: 'Buy some dried turnips and eat two meals of porridge, and I'll be back tonight!' But it's been three days now... My brother said: 'I'll cook some porridge, and you go to Caishi Road and look for her'..."</p>
<p>He stared at the distant shimmering eyes, and said lightly: the tone was so flat, without emotion, as if he was telling someone else's story. At one point, I suspected that this wide and unrealistic story was used to beg.</p>
<p>"Then, where is your father?" I carefully watched his expression and asked, as if to find loopholes in his story - why didn't he mention his father at all?</p>
<p>"Father has been in the police station for half a month. Even Mom doesn't know why. She shakes her head when I ask. Father collects garbage. He often goes to the police station... But, uncle! Where is Caishi Road? Please tell me how to get there!"</p>
<p>I was stunned, the contemptuous expectation was not the fact. But how should I direct him? Go straight, turn left, and then right... the child would not be able to remember clearly.</p>
<p>"Well! Caishi Road goes straight... But, little brother, I think you should go home! It's getting dark, you are such a small child. You'll get lost. Besides, Mom may not be there. If she was there, how could she abandon you and not come back for three days?"</p>
<p>"No way!" He said firmly, "My brother said: 'She's there'" He dragged his wide broken shoes and went forward again.</p>
<p>I watched his back disappear, and looked at the shadows of the rice carriers scurrying in the distance, and whispered to myself: "Let me go and tell him! 'Your mom will not be there! She may not be alive!'"</p>
<p>But C held my hand tightly and sighed: "Don't wound his young soul! It's getting late, let's go home!" I vaguely noticed that there were tears in his eyes!</p>
<p>The dusk was getting deeper, and the surroundings were filled with dark purple haze. The outline of the thatched cottage gradually blurred, and silence pressed down on the sighs of the earth. The dusk was even more depressing.</p>
<p>The sound of broken shoes dragging faintly came from the front, the child was groping.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Random Thoughts on Reading <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Su</p>
<p>In the "Extra Words Outside the Letters" of "Xiaocangshanfang Ruler and Letters", there is a passage that says:</p>
<p>"Xu Jingzong of the Tang Dynasty was good at medicine but refused to write a book, saying: 'I am afraid that people will get what I say, but they cannot get what I do not say, and they will definitely use medicine indiscriminately.' These two sentences can be used to understand the Tao of writing poetry and prose."</p>
<p>Although the words are few, the predecessors' intentions in writing and the cautious attitude towards writing can be seen from this, which makes people admire the demeanor of the ancients.</p>
<p>Today, although there is no shortage of well-educated people who are unwilling to write easily, there are also many people who rashly write books, as many as the sands of the Ganges. Among them, some people have no choice but to do this for the sake of livelihood, which is understandable; another kind of people are all for the sake of seeking false fame, which is even more unworthy of being followed. However, no matter what the motive is, the result of rashly writing books is always misleading to the world, which is not right!</p>
<p>When I was reading in middle school, my mathematics teacher Mr. Zhu earnestly told us in the classroom not to publish any works or articles until we were forty years old, because our knowledge and experience had not yet reached a rich and mature state. However, as soon as I left school, I forgot Mr. Zhu's advice. Over the years, I have published dozens of trivial and incomprehensible things in the newspaper supplement, and I am still "self-satisfied" in my heart. Now, when I see the words in "Xiaocangshanfang Ruler and Letters" and "Extra Words Outside the Letters", and I think of Mr. Zhu's admonition again, I feel even more ashamed and ashamed. "Knowing that it is wrong and deliberately committing it", and the accumulated habits are difficult to change, causing harm to the world, it is really a serious sin, Amitabha.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Autobiography of Mr. Banknote <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Zuren</p>
<p>My surname is Chao (钞, banknote), my name is Piao (票, ticket), and I come from a giant clan. The Central Reserve Bank, a prestigious giant family on the sea, is my original home. Therefore, people also call me Zhongchuquan (中储券, Central Reserve Currency), also known as C.R.B.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the issue, I tested my power a little, and with one kick, I kicked out the old legal currency, and used my brand-new posture to dominate the market it used to use: this is also the first thing I am proud of in my life.</p>
<p>After that, I became invincible and supreme all over the north and south of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>My journey is boundless, and I take the four seas as my home. It's really like "Ping Zong Xia Ji (萍蹤侠影, a martial arts novel)" wandering around. I have been a parasite in a wallet like a bulging frog's belly, and I have also hidden in women's handbags, and temporarily traveled with lipsticks, scented paper, powder boxes, fountain pens, diaries - I have also been to various pockets and been a noble guest...</p>
<p>Because; I am often being transferred from these two hands to those two hands, so I have experienced all kinds of handshakes, those rough, greasy, with bright nail polish on the fingers, and with strong Langtry perfume in the palms... I have all kissed them.</p>
<p>However, experience tells me that whenever some delicate, white, soft, and slender hands hold me, they are always so careless and casual, as if inadvertently. Only those rough and dirty hands, short and clumsy, when holding me, it seems that they have given all their strength to their fingers, pinching me tightly, as if afraid that I will escape, that kind of disgusting look, every time, I always curse it hatefully.</p>
<p>Because of frequent contact with the eyes of the people who fall on me, I have experienced many types of them: rude, gentle, charming,... but they all have a kind of sharp and greedy look like a hunting dog - everyone wants to possess me, grab me.</p>
<p>I often buy smiles and sweet kisses for people, and I also bring extravagant material enjoyment and spiritual pleasure to some hedonists. But, because of me, people will also lose their most precious time and spirit. The pure reason is drowned, and the bright future is destroyed. I also try my best to pour the bitter wine of annoyance and pain into them, but they don't blame my cruelty, in fact, it's their "self-inflicted"!"</p>
<p>The humans I have seen are absolutely selfish. For me, they are mutually hostile and attacking, and they have lost their sincere friendship. Some, however, are because of my co-optation, and on the surface, everyone pretends to be hypocritical, you coax me, why can't I coax you? I control the emotions of human beings! I dominate the dynamics of human beings!</p>
<p>People in the world. Whoever can possess a large amount of me can get the respect and admiration of other human beings. Behind him, there will also be many people following him enthusiastically. If he says, "The sun has no light," those people will also say, "Yes! The sun has no light." If he says again, "Nonsense! The sun has light," those people will immediately say, "Yes! The sun has light."</p>
<p>If he smokes a cigar, there will be many people rushing to strike a match, often because of grabbing the match, they open their ugly heads to each other - this is the prestige of a person with money.</p>
<p>Because people with money can get such glory (?), so many people are planning all day and all night, trying to obtain a sum of money as great as an astronomical number, so the world will never be quiet again.</p>
<p>In this way, then I have become the chief culprit in poisoning the souls of human beings, but in fact, isn't it those mediocre people who are disturbing themselves?</p>
<p>Don't despise me because of my current rotten appearance! I am a hero who has been through hundreds of battles! Now I still have a strong force that can threaten some people who are gasping under the burden of life! Don't believe it? That's up to you.</p>

<p>— Huang Tingduo</p>
<p>Who killed this innocent little soul?</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the tender green years passed away quietly,</p>
<p>Like the decline of an ancient tree of thousands of years!</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the loving mother's hope disappeared in the midst of sad sorrow!</p>
<p>Where is their lost lovely hometown?</p>
<p>I saw the shadows of the two of them in the alley half a year ago;</p>
<p>Alas! Because of the death of her husband and the destruction of her family, she was forced to become a traveler in the world!</p>
<p>Who among the passersby has ever thought of this tragic scene in the world?</p>
<p>The continuous snowflakes fell sharply last night,</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, suddenly there was a burst of crying, the sound of a high chant</p>
<p>Shattering the desolation and silence of the streets?</p>
<p>Heartbreaking night! Where is your comfort?</p>
<p>Sure enough, this poor little soul quietly left his mother,</p>
<p>No longer sharing the joys and sorrows of the world!</p>
<p>This time, the east revealed a bleak sunlight,</p>
<p>Staring at the vast white snow and leaving a deep sorrow!</p>
<p>The earth was lazily bored and tired,</p>
<p>Frozen drowsiness;</p>
<p>Cold ducks on the roof croaked in tragic and poignant tones!</p>
<p>The cold wind blew away her tear-filled eyes with the sunlight!</p>
<h3 id="e58">Mr. Feng Got a Raise <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Huairui</p>
<p>In his forties, of medium build, he always walks slowly and methodically. When he meets people, he always squints, with a smile on the corner of his mouth, and nods: "Hehe... Hello." This person is Feng Zhizhai, a "clerk" in a foreign company. Because of his long history of residence and his amiable way of dealing with people, almost everyone in Wender Lane knows him, and everyone respectfully calls him "Mr. Feng."</p>
<p>In the past, Mr. Feng also had a glorious history. At that time, he could be said to be the only role model in Wender Lane, the object of worship and admiration of all residents in the lane. When someone complains about the shortcomings of others, they always like to bring out his advantages for comparison. When women scold their husbands, they always say: "A useless good-for-nothing, drinking yellow soup and gambling all day long, don't you look at Mr. Feng, he neither drinks nor gambles, and he is so kind, you, this useless thing, it would be good if you could reach one of his hairs." When elderly old ladies quarrel with their sons and daughters-in-law, they also shout in a hoarse voice: "You are a pair of incompatible couples, who don't know what sins you have committed in your previous life, you make so much noise every few days, you are not afraid of people laughing behind your backs, don't you look at Mr. Feng, the two of them are always respectful and polite, and have never had a harsh word, only you two precious things..." Even when children ask their parents to buy toys or candy, they will also imitate their elders: "Ying'er in Mr. Feng's family, his father bought it for him a long time ago, why don't I have it?"</p>
<p>Mr. Feng's ability to gain such a reputation is not a fluke. It is the natural result of the convergence of rivers, the convergence of his daily actions. He not only has no bad habits such as prostitution and gambling, but even does not smoke or drink, which are almost considered daily necessities. He also has a considerable salary income every month, enough to maintain the stable life of a family of three, so if the four words "gentleman" are not interpreted in the opposite sense, then he can be worthy of it. Moreover, his wife is also a virtuous woman, helping him manage the housework in an orderly manner. His only hobby is to take his wife and children to the park or watch a movie on weekends or holidays, on the one hand, to entertain himself, and at the same time, to reward his wife who is busy all day: and his wife also prepares some more exquisite dishes on that day as the enjoyment of her hardworking husband. They care for each other and comfort each other, and the whole family is filled with a harmonious and cheerful atmosphere, no wonder the neighbors are so envious and admire him.</p>
<p>But all of this has become a thing of the past. Now when I think about it, only a vague outline remains, like a beautiful flower buried in heavy fog!</p>
<p>The light burden of life in the past has become heavier and heavier in recent years due to the soaring prices of everything, like Sun Wukong in "Journey to the West" carrying the incarnation of the Red Boy, making Mr. Feng, who has always lived a leisurely life, almost unable to breathe. Although parks, movies, and delicacies have long been given up, and all expenses have been saved as much as possible, they still often struggle to make ends meet even at the lowest level of life; his wife is virtuous, and she has not said half a word of complaint, but from her melancholy eyes and the unintentional revelation in her tone of envy for those heroes - nouveau riches - who have made a fortune by relying on the times, it can be seen that she is also quite unhappy with the current situation in her heart. His wife is the person he usually respects and loves, and seeing her in this sad and lonely situation, of course, makes Mr. Feng feel like he is sitting on pins and needles all day long, and his heart is filled with guilt, anxiety, and anxiety.</p>
<p>It is already the weather of early summer, and the sun has lost the warmth and kindness of spring, and shining on people only increases the feeling of dryness and heat.</p>
<p>Like usual, Mr. Feng slowly stepped on his way home from the "office". Because he was still wearing a lined shirt, he felt particularly dry and hot, and beads of sweat seeped out from his forehead and the tip of his nose. Looking at the people walking past him, many of them were already wearing "Palis" long gowns. This made him realize that his lined shirt was no longer in season, and at the same time, a general feeling of poverty struck his heart. He couldn't help but whisper to himself, "It's time to wear a single shirt."</p>
<p>Thinking of the single shirt, he couldn't help but think of that silk gown with frayed sleeves and collar, and holes in the hem. "No matter what, I can't wear it again!" he shouted secretly in his heart. He should have replaced it with a new one last year, but because the material was expensive, he had been delaying it, but this year he couldn't delay it any longer.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he gently pressed his pocket, where he had hidden the salary he had received today, a stack of not very thin banknotes - five hundred and twenty yuan. "It's a hundred and twenty yuan more than last month," the joy in his heart immediately turned into a smile on the corner of his mouth. He was thinking in his heart: "The salary increased this month will first be used to buy a long gown. This money is really not enough to make a new one, but fortunately, I have always been careless about clothes. If I go to the clothing store to pick up cheaper old clothes, it will definitely be much cheaper. In this way, the difference is probably limited. Although I will inevitably be a little tight next month, it will be fine; according to the settlement this month, as long as there is an income of more than five hundred yuan per month, not only will I not have to run into deficits again, but if I can save everywhere, there may be some surplus. Although the amount is extremely small, even a small amount of sand can make a tower. If I continue like this, can't I gradually restore the happy life I had before?" Thinking of this, Mr. Feng really felt extremely happy. The sun shining in front of him was emitting dazzling and brilliant light, and he thought, "Isn't this a symbol that I am stepping closer to the light?" So the joyful smile floated on the corner of his mouth again.</p>
<p>When he got home, Ying'er was playing silently by himself. When he saw his father, he rushed to him like a swallow, muttering, "Dad, have you collected your salary? What about the wooden horse you promised to buy me?"</p>
<p>"If I promised you, of course I'll buy it for you. It's too late today, I'll buy it for you in a few days." Because his heart was filled with joy, his tone was more gentle than usual.</p>
<p>His wife knew that he had gotten a raise, and she was also greatly pleased. Needless to say, they had a very sweet dinner that night.</p>
<p>But this perfect budget gradually collapsed as the days went by. Every night when he took notes, Mr. Feng deeply felt this: "Coal briquettes have risen by seven yuan per dan, flour has more than doubled, cooking oil has risen two times, soy sauce has risen by two-thirds, vegetables have risen... soap has risen... sugar has risen!..." A month passed, the budgeted long gown was not worn, but the threadbare shirt was sent to the high counter of the Changsheng pawnshop.</p>
<p>"Dad, what about the wooden horse you promised me?" Ying'er's daily request, disappointed that his father did not keep his promise, has gradually faded recently.</p>

<p>— Wan Li</p>
<p>—A Real Tragedy in the Henan Province Drought—</p>
<p>I shed reluctant,</p>
<p>compassionate hot tears,</p>
<p>when a friend told me</p>
<p>of the perilous tragedy there.</p>
<p>Desolate wilderness,</p>
<p>populated by ravaged,</p>
<p>exposed, starving corpses.</p>
<p>The devil's manipulation</p>
<p>has made the barren land</p>
<p>by the Yellow River in Central China</p>
<p>suffer an unprecedented</p>
<p>calamity in history!</p>
<p>The ravages of the god of war,</p>
<p>followed by</p>
<p>terrible disasters,</p>
<p>descend upon the world.</p>
<p>Tens of millions of pitiful compatriots</p>
<p>utter their last,</p>
<p>hungry cries,</p>
<p>Save us!</p>
<p>Barren land.</p>
<p>Rampage of natural disasters,</p>
<p>innocent people,</p>
<p>sadly perish.</p>
<p>In a dilapidated hut,</p>
<p>live two dying,</p>
<p>skull-like victims.</p>
<p>A mother with a loving heart,</p>
<p>and a pitiful child!</p>
<p>Innocent, naive,</p>
<p>lively child,</p>
<p>transformed into a jackal-like skeleton!</p>
<p>Years of constant,</p>
<p>inhumane life,</p>
<p>have caused the hardworking farmers</p>
<p>to lose the joys of the past.</p>
<p>Disasters have caused,</p>
<p>the people's</p>
<p>displacement,</p>
<p>families destroyed,</p>
<p>living in misery.</p>
<p>The child's father is gone!</p>
<p>To survive,</p>
<p>he abandoned his paternal</p>
<p>responsibility,</p>
<p>the haggard grandfather,</p>
<p>unable to withstand the scorching heat,</p>
<p>left his sorrowful life,</p>
<p>and began his grieving long sleep!</p>
<p>Fleeing!</p>
<p>Death!</p>
<p>Waiting for rescue!</p>
<p>Grass roots,</p>
<p>tree bark,</p>
<p>are the panacea to relieve hunger!</p>
<p>Mom! Mom!</p>
<p>Hungry! Hungry!</p>
<p>I... hungry...</p>
<p>Everywhere are groans and laments!</p>
<p>Hunger drives</p>
<p>rational human beings</p>
<p>to cannibalize their brethren!</p>
<p>Horrible!</p>
<p>A neighbor proposed to her</p>
<p>to exchange children!</p>
<p>She refused.</p>
<p>Mother!</p>
<p>The most loving person in the world!</p>
<p>She refused!</p>
<p>Love cannot solve</p>
<p>the severe hunger.</p>
<p>The result of the refusal is</p>
<p>disappointment and pain.</p>
<p>What is seen,</p>
<p>is the starvation in the whole village!</p>
<p>What is heard,</p>
<p>is the adversity at the final moment!</p>
<p>Death is the only destination,</p>
<p>unable to die,</p>
<p>and unable to live.</p>
<p>Human tragedies are forced</p>
<p>to happen!</p>
<p>On a certain day,</p>
<p>the morning sun</p>
<p>shines brightly on two</p>
<p>tightly embraced corpses,</p>
<p>they - mother and child -</p>
<p>in the loving mother's hand,</p>
<p>held a blood-stained knife,</p>
<p>stabbing it into the child's throat!</p>
<p>Dead!</p>
<p>Died without a sound.</p>
<p>As if the earth has lost</p>
<p>a tiny mouse!</p>
