<p>代論</p>
<h3>重慶之命運（中）——重慶國民黨分裂之必然性中共對於國共合作的意圖</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>中國共產黨對於國共合作的態度，從毛澤東在中共六中全會上所作的演說裏，也可以清晰地看得出來。他對於和國民黨長期合作問題，作過如下的說法。「為了保證長期的合作，還要解決合作的組織形式問題。我們曾經批駁一黨主義。不論是對於過去歷史來說，對於當前任務上說，對於中國社會性質上說，所謂一黨主義都是沒有根據的，也是做不到的，行不通的，違背一致團結抗敵建國的大止標，有百害而無一利的。那末，各黨共存，而互相結成為一個抗敵民族統一戰綫，要不要一種統一的共同的組織呢？要的，必要的，沒有這樣的統一共同的組織，不利於團結抗敵，更不利於長期合作。……」正像毛澤東所說的，共產黨是否始終一貫地在想過：「不論是對於過去歷史來說，對於當前任務上說，對於中國社會性質上說，所謂一黨主義，都是沒有根據的，……有百害而無一利的」呢？縱令一對於過去歷史來說」，可惜得很，也不能輕易肯定這種說法。試觀過去決定中國共產黨方針的共產國際（Cominttu）對於這個問題是怎樣討論的。一九二七年五月二十三日至二十六日閒，所召集的共產國際第八屆執行委員會後，在中國問題委員會會議上，史太林和托洛斯基間會發生過論戰，我們暫且摘錄幾句論戰的話作為參考。當時托洛斯基曾說過：「四月五日（一九二年四月），即蔣介石發動政變的一星期前，史太林在莫斯科積極份子會議上，仍然拒絕拉迪克（Radek）的意見，且曾聲明說：「蔣介石是服從規律的，警吿是沒有理由的。我們利用中國的資產階級（Borgeoisie），然後就像榨盡的香機樹（Citron）一樣，丟掉」……史太林這一演說記錄，尙未發表的兩三天內，這個榨盡的香　（此處指蔣介石一黨——吉田註）就掌握了政權」。史太林對於這一點回答說：「俄羅斯共產黨和共產國際，在現實上，並非是喜歡支持民族資產階級的政策，只要中國革命是全民聯合戰綫的革命，那就要採取利用民族資產階級的政策，然後中國革命轉變為土地革命，而民族資產階級脫離革命隊伍的時候，則放棄此種政策，而代之以武力反對民族資產階級鬥爭的政策」。在這幾句簡短的話裏，也可以明顯地表示出來，當時的共產國際和中共，在某一時期內，在某一條件下，按照資產　級性的民主革命目的，來利用國民黨，當利用價値消逝時，則像榨盡的香機渣滓一樣，投到垃圾堆裏。</p>
<p>這種一貫的精神，是談不到主張「各黨並存」的誠意階級合作的。他們在「某一個階段內」所反對的一黨主義，這只是限於國民黨的一黨主義，很明顯，他們的目標是想建立中共自巳的一黨主義。中共應付國民黨的這一基本立塲，即在國共合作開始後，仍然　未變化。然而抗戰開始後，中共幹部感覺到對於應付國民黨的基本方針，有掩飾的必要了。他們儘量不出頭露面，而無論如何都把國民黨捧出來，企圖給別人一種印像，認為他們是在國民黨的領導下。（轉入第四版）</p>
<h3>周財長發表聲明蘇淮區調整通貨中儲劵與聯銀劵一併行使</h3>
<p>南京二于四日中央社電　溯自中儲券發行以來，經財政當局之不斷努力，以及盟邦之眞誠協助，其流通範圍日益擴展，人民信仰愈益堅張。目前華中華南各地均巳以中儲券為唯一通貨，茲悉蘇淮特區方面，亦定十二月一日起，開始以中儲券與聯銀券一併行使，因此中儲券之流通範圍，又將伸展至蘇淮地區。此舉於國家統1幣制，健全金融之整個通貨政策上，將有劃期之展開，其意義至為重大。財玫部周兼部長，昨特為此發表鄭重聲明·國明此舉之意義，並料一併行使後，必有相當成績，然後再將聯銀劵停止在當地之新發行，進而參酌情形，實行兩面交換，確立以中儲券為唯一通貨。至一併行使後之兌換率，則仍按中儲券百元對聯銀券十八元辦理之。茲將周財長聲明（陳次長代行）錄後：</p>
<p>比年以來，我國通雙政策，經政府不斷之勞力，盟邦之協助，在華中華甫各地，中央儲備銀行券巳成為唯一通貨。惟蘇淮行政，自經調整以來，所有通貨，以支付習慣，及一般人民財產所寄，其行使範圍，仍限於中國聯合準備銀行鈔券，於金融流通，物資調節，不無影響。茲以行政調整，為求愈臻完善起見，對於蘇淮特別區現行通貨制度，按照下列辦法，酌予調整：　自民國三十二年十二月一日起，蘇淮特區之通貨，以中央儲備銀行券與中國聯合準備銀行券一併行使，俟有相當成績，苒將中國聯合準備銀行券在當地之新發行予以停止。參酌當時情形，定期實行全面交換，以中央儲備銀行券為唯一通貨。　中央儲備銀行券與中國聯合準備銀行券之兌換率，仍按儲備券一百元對聯銀券十八元辦理。　所有蘇淮桔別區之公款收支，此後亦得以中央儲備銀行券收付。　華北與華中之通貨制度，固不因本辦法而根本有所變更，即蘚淮對華北農產之原有措置，亦不因之而有所影響。</p>
<p>基乎以上辦法，嗣後蘇淮與各地之物資交流，必益臻便利，凡我國民，務各仰體斯旨，協助政府，切實推行，以期政府之通貨政策，得以完遂，除呈報並通行外，特此鄭重聲明，並謝友邦政府當局協助之厚意。</p>
<p>下月一日實行</p>
<p>南京二十四日中央社電　蘇淮地區束通連雲港，西接　海路，南通京滬，北扼平津，為我國軍政重鎭且人烟稠密，物產豐富，素有中國烏克開之稱。國府還都後，鑒於該地區地位之重要，乃於三十一年一月，特設蘇淮特區行政長官公署，直隸於行政院，綜轄二十二巿縣，從事政治軍事經濟各方面之建設。迄今將達兩載，由於各方面之不斷努力，巳奠定其在大東亞戰爭中擔任後方建設之基礎。現無論在政治軍事經濟各部門，均巳有長足之進展。至賅地區之通貨問題，自特區公署成立以後，因為顧及一般人民之財產及支付習慣上之便利，故其行使範圍，始終仍限於華北之聯銀券，此於金融流通，物資調節等方面，不無影饗。茲者政府當局為使賅桔　在行政調整上，促其更進一步之完善起見，決將該地區之美行通貨制度，加以調整。自十二月一日起，規定在該地區內中儲券與原有之聯銀券，一併行使。其行使比率，仍按中儲券百元對聯銀券十八元辦理。幷規定今後該特區之一切公款收支　以中儲券為中心，俟有相當成續後，再進一步考盧，停止該地區聯銀參之發行，更進而參酌情形，實行全面交換，以貫澈中儲劵為唯一通貨之政策。當局此項之斷然措置，誠為賢明而適當。蓋此舉無論在統一幣制上，金融政策之健全上，以及對該地區之行政調整，物資流通等各方面，均具有重大之意義。故各方對當局此舉，莫不異常重視，而寄予深切之期待。深信此項辦法實行後，其所得之效果，預期有　國府統一幣制，穩定金融之整個通貨政策，得以開展。　中儲券流通範圍更因而擴大，對於人民之信仰上，收獲又進一步之效果。其唯一法定通貨性之性格，亦將愈形業固。　此舉實行後，對於特區公署之行政調整上，曁金融流通各方面，定將因此更臻完善圓滑。　嗣後蘇淮特區與各地間之物資交流事宜，亦必因此而愈臻方便有利。</p>
<p>盟邦决予協助</p>
<p>南京二十四日中央社電　日駐華大使館當局，於二十四日就國府調整蘇淮特區通貨事　稱，國民政府前　設置蘇淮特區行政公署，從事行政機構之整備，但其後該地區流通之　貨，仍為中國聯合準備銀行券。茲後十二月一日起，決定該地區使用中央儲備銀行券，將來即廢止聯銀券之新發行，並實施　通貨之全面交換，使該地區完全流通中儲券。國府此次調整蘇淮地區還貨制度。乃為適應蘇淮地區行政機構之整備，對華中華北現行通貨制度，並無任何變更，及兩通貨之交換比率，當一仍其舊。日本對此次措置，決探取一切協力之方針，謀該地今後經濟建般之進展，並期極力圓滑該地區重要物資之收買，及對華北物資之交流。</p>
<h3>久米正雄訪林宣部長</h3>
<p>南京廿四日中央社電　日本文壇元老久米正雄，為聯絡明年在京舉行之大東亞文學者大會事宜，特於昨（廿四）日下午六時半，由日本大使館岸情報部長陪同，前往林宣傳部長官邸，謁見林部長，由林部長親予接見。對來年大東亞文學者大會事宜，頗多懇談。</p>
<h3>盟邦改革　駐華外交機構　決先改革南京大使館</h3>
<p>南京廿四日中央社電　日駐華大使館方面，前以中日同盟條約締結後，中日關係巳有新的躍進。為適應此種新階段，並以徹底實現對華新政策起見，前曾擬將駐華外交機關，加强統一運管，並將機構陣容，作有機的調整，故其後即以大使館為中心，與各地事務所，積極進行具體實施方策。茲為呼應B本本國中央當局，加强戰時行政運營體勢，使現地機構趨於簡案　力，乃決定先改革南京大使館，及大使館上海事務所之機構。即大使館方面廢除過去所設之政務經濟文化情報四部，改為總務與情報兩部。另在情報部內設立調査室。總務部長一職由公使充任，以實現預定之强力簡素，同時大使館上海事務所機構，改為官房總務室經濟第一部（產業交通），經濟第二部（財政），總務室之一部，歸入大使館，而大使館總務之一部，即兼管上海總務室。關於情報方面，縮為大使館悄報部分辦事處之格式，而以其全部機構，限定於經濟方面之實際施策·如此，大使館與大使館上海事務所，即趨於統一緊密。又繼此次大使館與大使館上海事務所改革之後，北京·張家口·廣東·各大使館事務所，與大使館之統一緊密問題，預料最近亦可實現。同時因此種統一機構之改革，日本在華外交陣容，即可正以大使為中心，在適應新情勢下，而將發揮全力。預料現在之人事，勢將作根本的調整，一俟實現後，在同盟條約中可顯示之日本對華新政策，即可望在駐華大使之統一管轄下，而進入飛躍的實踐階段。</p>
<h3>衛生署舉行醫師甄別會議</h3>
<p>南京二十四中央社電前內政部衛生司曾於本年四月，組織醫師甄別委員會，甄別醫師，該次甄別後，衛生司即令撤銷，甄別結果因此亦未發表。茲悉衛生署茲桔繼續辦理，並定於今（二十四）日下午五時半，在該署舉行醫師甄別委員會會議，商討初試啓封，及覆試事宜。</p>
<h3>復興中國經濟　須積極實現中國統一　鮑斯氏對渝方民衆作錄音廣播</h3>
<p>南京二十四日中央社電　自由印度臨時政府主席江桔拉鮑斯氏，曾於二十日夜對渝方民衆作第一次廣播，繼之二十三日夜復對渝方民衆作錄音廣播，茲錄其要旨如次：</p>
<p>諸君或知重慶遣軍駐印，與英軍立於同一戰綫，作戰之事實，若蔣介石氏果為國民主義者，或愛國者，復何為助英彈壓印度國民主義者，而向印度派遣軍隊乎。且蔣氏助英彈壓國民主義者，此巳非初次。去年彼之軍隊，為維持英國對緬旬之支配權，曾協力英軍作戰，但緬　民衆並未曾加害於中國，此種行為將使印緬民衆認蔣氏為英帝國主義之傀儡。</p>
<p>一九四二年，蔣氏為使印度指導者與英國妥論，　受英政府之招待而蒞印。蔣氏若有正義公平仁愛之情，即應對英政府要求承認印度獨立，至少亦應不使其駐印軍隊助英作戰，然終於使吾人失望。余認中日和平後之巾國統一與中國之解放，不能使全亞洲進入新時代，如此予印度獨立鬥爭一有力剌激。中國國民更可復興經濟，恢復過去繁美。余有鑒於此，故願告諸君，中日間一切問題，須適應新情勢，大胆率直處理之。</p>
<p>余每談希望中日和平，並非止於吾個人之意見，此乃全印國民之希望。余相信中國之統一，實為今日急切需要者，妨害統一之工作，不僅為對中國之罪惡，對印度。對全亞洲，亦為罪惡。今日中國達成統一之最大障碍，即英美惡勢力之存在。英美於中國可能統一時，常欺瞞中國民衆，作種種宣傳，復使之趨於分散。例如英國以印　國境之冬季攻勢將屆，即對全世界宣傳，彼等於奪囘緬甸。開通緬甸公路後，決加强援助重慶。然余深知印緬國境方面雙方情形，該方面巳有吾等勇敢之同志駐守，是故余敢　書於未來之作戰中、定可使印度之孟加拉與阿　密兩省，解說英國之桎梏。</p>
<p>若夫此次戰爭、日本不幸敗北，則亞洲之未來，抑或中國與印度之未來、致將如何。試參照過去亞洲之歷史，即可明瞭。再如日本自第一等强國降低地位時，則英美定仍將中國為共自肥之H具，共壓榨橫議，必將較過去尤甚。英美今仍大事宣傳，彼等既或失敗，美國亦將支持重慶，使足以獲得有利之和平而存在，但吾人對之稍加分析時，即可知其荒謬，蓋英美即玩弄任何手段，亦難左右日本。彼籌更宣傳，「中國之統一與中日之和平非　於實現者，此等問題，須延至戰爭吿終時解決之」云，此即分離中國之陰謀。　中國如不統一，中日之和平絕難實現，而中國之復興與繁榮，亦不可能。擊受經濟困窘者乃中國民衆故欲從速復興中國經濟，則非積極實現中國之統一不可。諸君，余切望諸君龍眞誠考慮或接受余之忠　，負起中國以及亞洲之重大使命，為解放亞洲挺身而團緖一致。</p>

<h3>日推行戰時外交已獲得偉大成果　大東亞前途充滿無限光明</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　大東亞戰爭勃發後，日本即表明該戰爭非僅有關日本一國之利害，實為大東亞全體之防禦戰與解放戰，故日本之戰時大東亞外交，即本此種旨趣而推展，力謀實現大東亞之團結。大東亞戰爭將屆兩年，茲僅就過去之兩年間日本之外交施策略述於後，大東亞戰爭勃發後，日本於昭和十六年（民國三十年）十二月二十一日，與泰國締結攻守同盟，因此泰國乃確定其為日本武器盟友之態度，繼之泰國於昭和十七年一月二十五日對英·美宣聯，日本對越南則本諸日·越共同防衛協定及各種經濟協定，作萬全措置。大東亞戰爭開始第四日，即十二月十二日，更進一步締結日·越軍事協定，其後日，越關係即順利進展，以迄於今。再就中，日關係觀之，大東亞戰爭勃發前，已有同甘共苦之不可分關係，及本年一月九日，中國對英·美毅然宣戰，日本實施對華新政策，中·日關係因而進入同生共死之一體關係，十月三十日，中·日復成立同盟條約，使中·日關係展開新歷史之第一頁。此外日本復與八月一日獨立之緬旬，及十月十四日獨立之菲律賓，分別締結同盟條約，於十月二十三日，率先承認十月二十一日成立之自由印度臨時政府，闡明決對援助印度獨立運動日本之理念，因事實證明，巳着著實現。今大東亞巳結成一具有家族性之集團，其具體表現，即十一月五·六兩日，在東京舉行之大束亞會議與代表東亞十億民族總意之大東亞宣言·其理想之深遠與去大，實非敵方之大西洋憲章與莫斯科之四國共同宣言等所能望及。要之，大東亞會議及大東亞共同宣言，即本1貫外交方針之成果，今後日大束亞外交，決本此方針，回前推進，自不待言，更將努力使之普及全世界。</p>
<p>英美政策失敗愈感焦燥不安</p>

<h3>加拿大和巴西的現狀</h3>
<p>加拿大</p>
<p>西半球為英美積極整備戰時態勢者，北有加拿大，南有巴西。加拿大在國內本來有英國系和法國系的對立，從英美看來，這對立猶如目上的　瘤。加拿大總人口一千一百當中，二百九十萬是法國系，以加拿大東部奎貝克為中心的法國系所主張的限制對英援助論，今日在加拿大政界上頗有力量，現在加拿大兵的派赴外國，祗限於志願兵，不　被派赴海外者，不能強制的派遣至外國。日本軍攻略香港時，加拿大軍幾瀕全滅，那時加拿大國內的法國系政治家，即以此為攻擊政府的材料。又在法國北部第埃浦，　曼陀的英軍，其百分之八十是加拿大兵，也受極大的損害，同樣在加拿大政界問引起風波。加拿大的陸軍，總數約七卞五萬，運送至英國的前後計三次，累積計　五萬前次從事攻略西西里的加拿大兵，亦為其一部</p>
<p>飛機與造船</p>
<p>加拿大貢獻於英美者是飛機與造船。在加拿大還沒有聽說建造軍吐，哈利克斯，聖喬思，溫哥華，維多利亞等地。至於飛機，開始製造轟炸機似乎是最近的事實。到今日為止，加拿大運輸至英國的飛機，　數累計五百至千架。飛機的製造，今尙為數不多，其訓練由英美　　担任·加拿大國內的飛行學校大約為三四十校。</p>
<p>再看經濟方面·除人口不足外，其餘似尙不覓捉襟見肘，實施配給制的以肉，煤，汽油等為主，其限制尙稱寬大。加拿大有煤，也有石油，煤並且有雙美國的本　文尼亞州供給十故現在尙不感不足。私人汽車的汽油每　限制為三加倫。火　和小麥是加拿大的主要產物，一手包辦對英輸出。一般物價，薪給，H資等的統制自一九四〇年九月起開始，比之美國的雜亂無章，進行似較有秩序。美國以加拿大的物價統制為藍本。因為的不足之結果，女子勞動者頗多，這在平常也一樣，加拿大尤為顯著。加拿大地方，女子之成為勞働者，仍是一種可以誇耀於人的事。</p>
<p>巴西</p>
<p>去年一月未，里和會議的最後一日，巴西和軸心國斷絕外交關係，同年八月，對德宣戰。物資不足的情形，在巴西頗為嚴重。去年七月半，因汽油缺芝，早巳命令禁止使用私人汽車。當時，新聞影片中映出羅斯福的演說時，觀衆大叫：「汽油怎樣了？」巴西的物資一向不甚豐富，由此可見民衆對美國的反美感情，　泛地傳播着。試看其物資不足的狀况：出差汽油每週限制三十公近汽油，今年六月起，砂糖每人每月二公斤，麵包亦採配給制，肉，牛油，鹽，大感不足，均排隊候買。由於斷絕外交和布吿對德宣戰，巴西所得的祇有國內物資不足。巴西以前每年約有五百萬噸船舶的出入，至今日减至一百二十五萬噸·據政府所發表，輸入稅减百分之六十。</p>
<p>前途難樂觀</p>
<p>就農業言，咖啡大受打擊，棉花亦不振。薄荷和生絲是所　戰時景無的產物。美國量次宣傳的在亞瑪遜地帶栽培　膠，完全是空話。最多不過五萬　的收獲。其將業離開美國的樂觀材料尙遠。</p>
<p>把西對美國供給的軍事基地中最大者，是北部的納塔耳。巴西軍隊是否派遣至海外，尤其是非洲，有二種觀測，其詳不得而知，大約除義勇軍之外，並未派兵至海外，似可確定。美國曾作豪說稱把巴西改作飛機和軍艦的製造所，但照巴西武器不足的現狀看來，也不外是紙上空談。巴西的戰艦共有三艘，其中一艘沉沒，一艘重傷，一艘所在不明。巴西的商船，被潛水艦襲擊而受大打擊，為南美諸國如阿根廷等所等。巴西的造船能力貧弱，在短時間內，這損失難望恢復。巴西的建艦能力，祇能建造小型驅逐艦，　此點看來，巴西對美國的貢獻，甚為薄弱機—（翔：驛自十一月十大日西部朝日新）</p>
<h3>太平洋作戰義艦不適用</h3>
<p>羅馬廿四日中央社電　海通社特派員自消息靈通之義海軍方面獲悉：淪入英美手中之義戰艦、並不能使用於太平洋，其一，因義艦所需之軍火，係義國所特製艦上所存者僅足供一次大戰之用。其二，因義艦之建造，系專供在地中海使用、不能冒太平洋之怒濤。此項璣艦如被派至太平洋、實屬無謂犧牲。</p>

<p>里斯本二十四日中央社電據海通社訉：此間法公使館正式否認貝當元帥將辭法元首職之說，法使館向報界發表謂，具當身體甚健，一切謠傳均非事實。</p>

<h3>與冬賑</h3>
<p>最近各界對於冬　運動，　見積極，在陳市長領導之下，　巳組成「冬賬經費勸寡委員會」，聘定經濟界有力人士，及各業領袖，分任隊長，即日開始勸　工作；此一舉措，造福社會，嘉惠窮黎，自非淺鮮。當此寒風　冽之際，飢寒交迫的貧民，有待於我們的賑濟，　着大　之望雲霓，希望此一運動，能夠迅速展開推進，因為經濟界人士，力景較大，倘能率先倡導，領袖羣倫，則其影響所及，定能使基層社會之經濟病態，為之輕滅。</p>
<p>査歷來冬賬辦法，不外施衣施食，良以衣食兩項，為人民生活最迫切之問題，未可一日或緩。因此，冬賑雖為社會福利問題，要不失為社會經濟問題；我們主張對於冬賬辦法之釐訂，人事之整飭、機構之强化，在在均宜注意改進，而施賬對象，　務期普遍，施賬手續，務期迅捷，此乃施賑不易之原則，為我們所期待於主持矌務人員者。</p>
<p>進一步言，施賬巳為消　辦法，縱能辦到盡善盡美，亦不過為慈善之舉，故自積極方面言，除老弱無吿者，須使安於其所外，亟當設法减少少壯中的失業者，使其有所H作，使其能夠參加生產，不為社會之蠹，是當由工　實業界儘量容納此大批勞務者，使成為生產分子，並由政府當局，基於戰時安定民生的原則，予以一切有力的支援。</p>
<h3>本市大量游資投入　農林畜牧事業　兩月中將達一萬萬元</h3>

<p>但在最近一　月中，此種游資，巳逐漸得其歸宿，一部份流入內地．購置地產，一部份則因最近上海各銀行錢莊及各種企業之紛紛增　，投入於金融事業及</p>
<p>工商企業</p>
<p>雖然尙有一部份游資，仍在投機買　中活動，但為數已極微細。然時至今日，市塲上之投機買賣，巳至最後掙扎時期，且其危險之襲來，往往出人　外，故一船較有眼光之投資家，均願以其資本投資於不受環境影饗</p>
<p>農林牧畜</p>
<p>事業、　農林敎畜事業無論在戰時在平時，均較其他事業為可靠，是以據專家估計，在最近兩月中，本巿擁資者之投資於上述企業中者，將達一萬萬元之巨，此誠上海游資之最合理歸宿，亦國家經濟前途之好現象。</p>

<h3>代論　（自第一版轉來）</h3>
<p>此種企圖之一，就是他們的所謂一黨外政策」，例如假借　誠，白崇禧，馮玉祥，孫科等黨外有力奢的霄論行動，以宜傳他們自己的主張。然而中共對於國共合作的另外一個企圖，即一九三八年三月國民黨CC團所暴露的「中國共產黨策略路錢」。據說在這一標題下所寫的小册子，是張浩在抗日大學所作的講義筆記。在該書中，關於國共合作的本質，有如下的規定。因為它對於把握國共合作的本質，是頗有重要性的，所以不厭其煩，而把全文揭載出來。</p>
<p>「中國共產黨目前在抗戰階段上，與國民黨妥協合作，這決不是投降，更不是出賣無產階級的利益，因而其意義如下：　　　放棄難行的革命路綫，另求較易的走向無產階級（Proletariat）專政的路綫。</p>
<p>通過公開工作，以掩護秘密工作的發展，爭取廣大人民羣衆的力量，以求顛覆資產階級的政權。</p>
<p>對革命要與以休養的時間，在這一期間，要養精蓄銳，並準備新的進步條件。</p>
<p>暫時放棄明顯的進攻策略，採取退守策略，不久再一轉變，而採取進攻策略。</p>
<p>鬭爭疲勞時，必須休養，以保存革命力量；因此暫時放棄革命制度，放棄表面上的名義，而保存其實質，以求將來更偉大的勝利。</p>
<p>紅軍改稱國民革命軍，只不過番號的改變，並非改編之意。紅軍仍然保持其獨立性，且更努力加以擴大和强化。蘇維埃改為特區政府，也非改變其實質，尤其不是創弱無產階級政權的力量，反而是發展更廣大的人民羣衆的革命力量。</p>
<p>現在的妥協，是為了解除目前的黨禁，釋放政治犯，爭取集會結社言論自由，改善人民生活，這全是對無產階級革命有利的，且是實現無產階級專政的準備。</p>
<p>現在的妥協，簡而言之，是孤立國民黨，建立民主共和國，推翻一黨專政的國民政府，以期無產階級專政的實現。」</p>
<p>這一文件發表後，周恩來頗感不安，於是發表了一篇公開信，認為這一文件是經日本特務機關的手寫成的。然而這樣表現着中共現實的方針文件，除了中共黨員自己能寫以外，還有誰能寫呢？假如是日俄戰爭時的日本特務機關（當時列寗和潛入俄羅斯的日本明石中將曾發生過連繫——吉田註）的話，那或者可能，然而今日的日本特務機關，是否能寫出這樣的微妙東西來，我認為周恩來本人比誰都知道的淸楚。該書中所展開的思想，對於一利用國民黨不能冉利用的時候，則像榨盡的香　渣滓一樣，拋掉」這一中共的方針，眞是描寫得淋漓盡致。無論中共怎樣說得天花亂墜，但它決沒有和國民黨永久合作的意圖，這一點有過去的歷史為證。</p>
<p>國共雙方立塲的不同</p>
<p>上面業已講過，在一九二七年中國問題委員會上，史太林曾說過：「俄羅斯共產黨和共產國際，在現實上，並非是喜歡支持民族資產階級的政策，只要中國革命是全民聯合戰綫的革命，那就耍採取利用民族資產階級的政策」。他很明顯地承認出來，「採取利用中國民族資產階級政策」的主體者，即「俄雜斯共產黨及共產國際」：且無意中表示出來，是站在「俄羅斯共產黨及共產國際」的立塲上，來處理中國問題的。這並非筆者想斷章取義，正因為道種傾向在中共裹存在着，才成為一九三八年四月發生張國　事件的主要因素。張國燾為什麽脫離中共，而加入國民黨呢？關於動機，他自己會說過以下的話：「回憶民國二十四年夏，毛澤東所領導的一方面軍，和我所領導的四方面軍，在四川西部會師時，二者間業巳發生了意見上的衝突。毛澤東說「長征」是勝利，且曾主張進入陝西，在川陝甘根據地上，必須重新建立蘇維埃共和國。說「長征」是失敗，且堅決主張我們在四川的西部西康方面駐紮，要求與中央軍停戰，全國一致對外，實現抗日方針。因有這歡意見的衝突，於是中共形成了分裂的形勢。當年的十二月（民國二十四年——吉田註），因第三國際（Thrid　International）決定了抗日民族統一戰綫的方針，於是這種爭論就逐漸消逝，終於一，二，四方面軍在陝西會合了……然而抗戰發動後，毛澤東所保持的中共獨立自主，那中共別立門戶，不以國家民族為重的精神，愈益離間了我和他的意見。因此，我不顧一切，斷然脫離延安，而來到武漢」。</p>
<p>根據上述兩個引證，就可以明白：中共對於中國革命的方針，婦根結底並非是決定於「以國家民族為重」的立塲，而是決定於以蘇聯為中心的世界革命立塲。只要國民黨的立塲和中共的世界革命立塲，具有一致的客觀形勢時，國共合作才能繼續；然而在中國，這兩個立塲不一致的時候，二者間當然就會爆發摩擦和鬭爭。而其實在例證，眞是不　枚舉。以前，當日本的特使松岡和史太林在莫斯科車姑上握手言歡，以及締結日蘇中立條約的時候，還有人以為這對於抗戰的中國，是有利的麽？雖然，無論誰都知道沒有利，可是中共對於中立條約，從未非難蘇聯半句。在這一點上，也可以看出國共間的立塲是不同的。</p>
<p>再從民主議議的純理論上講，當然一國內可以並存着許多收黨。然而如各個政黨都各自擁有軍隊，各自握有政府，那末早巳不成其為統一國家了。主權，領土，人民是國家構成的三大要素；所以，實際上兼有這三大要素的中共，自稱並非國家，這正如手中拿着掠奪品，而偏說自己不是强盜，是同樣自欺欺人之談。從民主主義的法理上來說，抗戰的中國，顯然是並行存在着兩個國家。並非是一個國家中有兩個政黨，而只是想把兩個國家，統一於一個政府之下的附國國爭。中國的統一，雖然是民國革命以來，四萬萬中國人民的熱烈要求，雖然他們也奉之為抗戰的最高目的，但抗戰中國的現實姿態，却不外是中國的分裂。兩個政黨，不，兩個國家，都自己相信將來的前途，歸根結底必須消滅對方，只是在這種情形上，雙方締結了暫時的停戰協定。</p>
<p>現在蘇聯，和日本的盟邦德國在拼死活，假如在這個時候，重慶請求日本媾和，那末這一點雖然對中國的命運非常迫切，但中共也必然將採取反對的立塲。因此，重慶政府假如和日本妥協的時候，國共間的停戰協定，立刻撕毀，必然陷入戰爭狀態，這是無人不曉的。中國共產黨，就是逼迫重慶和日本繼續作戰的督戰隊。假如重慶想對反日戰爭稍微表示怠工（Sabotage），則中共就好像「天方夜譚（Arabian　Nights」傳奇中所描寫的水手辛德班肩七所騎着的神怪老人一樣，就會用力箍緊重慶的頭頸，而使喘不出氣來。重慶只要擺脫不掉這位神怪老人中共，那末和日本的妥協是絕對不可能的。然而重慶只要肩膀上負荷着這位老人的時候，重慶就疲於奔命地受肩上老人的指使，一直到筋疲力竭而昏倒於地上以前，不能不按着老人所指示的方向前進。這就是建立在國共合作上的「重慶之命運」。—（季譯）（本節完）</p>

<h3>The Fate of Chongqing (Part Two) - The Inevitability of the Kuomintang Split in Chongqing and the CCP's Intentions Regarding Cooperation Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party</h3>
<p>— By Toshisuke Yoshida</p>
<p>The attitude of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) towards cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can also be clearly seen from Mao Zedong's speech at the Sixth Plenary Session of the CCP. He made the following statement regarding the issue of long-term cooperation with the Kuomintang: "In order to guarantee long-term cooperation, it is also necessary to solve the organizational form of cooperation. We have criticized one-party rule. Whether in terms of past history, current tasks, or the nature of Chinese society, the so-called one-party rule is unfounded, impossible, unworkable, and violates the great goal of unified solidarity against the enemy and national construction. It has a hundred harms and no benefits. Then, is it necessary to have a unified common organization for all parties to coexist and unite to form a united front against the enemy for national salvation? Yes, it is necessary. Without such a unified common organization, it is not conducive to unity against the enemy, and even less conducive to long-term cooperation..." Just as Mao Zedong said, has the Communist Party always consistently thought: "Whether in terms of past history, current tasks, or the nature of Chinese society, the so-called one-party rule is unfounded... it has a hundred harms and no benefits"? Even "in terms of past history," regrettably, it is not easy to affirm this statement. Let's observe how the Communist International (Comintern), which decided the CCP's policy in the past, discussed this issue. During the meeting of the China Problem Committee after the Eighth Executive Committee of the Communist International, which was convened from May 23 to 26, 1927, there was a debate between Stalin and Trotsky. Let us temporarily extract a few sentences from the debate for reference. At that time, Trotsky said: "On April 5 (April 1927), one week before Chiang Kai-shek launched the coup, Stalin still rejected Radek's opinion at the Moscow activists' meeting and declared: 'Chiang Kai-shek obeys the rules, and there is no reason for warnings. We will use the Chinese bourgeoisie, and then discard them like a squeezed lemon (Citron)'... Stalin's speech record, within two or three days of not being published, this squeezed lemon (referring to Chiang Kai-shek's party - Yoshida's note) seized power." Stalin replied to this point: "The Russian Communist Party and the Communist International, in reality, do not like to support the policy of the national bourgeoisie. As long as the Chinese revolution is a revolution of the united front of the whole people, then it is necessary to adopt a policy of utilizing the national bourgeoisie. Then, when the Chinese revolution turns into a land revolution, and the national bourgeoisie leaves the revolutionary ranks, then abandon this policy and replace it with a policy of armed struggle against the national bourgeoisie." In these few short words, it can also be clearly expressed that the Communist International and the CCP at that time, within a certain period, under certain conditions, utilized the Kuomintang according to the bourgeois democratic revolution purpose. When the utilization value disappears, it is thrown into the garbage heap like the squeezed lemon dregs.</p>
<p>This consistent spirit does not speak of the sincerity of advocating "coexistence of all parties" and class cooperation. Their opposition to one-party rule "at a certain stage" is limited to the Kuomintang's one-party rule. Obviously, their goal is to establish their own one-party rule of the CCP. The CCP's basic position in dealing with the Kuomintang remained unchanged even after the start of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. However, after the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the CCP cadres felt that it was necessary to conceal the basic policy for dealing with the Kuomintang. They try not to come forward and try to promote the Kuomintang anyway, trying to give others the impression that they are under the leadership of the Kuomintang. (Continued on page four)</p>
<h3>Minister Zhou Announces That Central Reserve Bank Notes and United Reserve Bank Notes Will Be Used Together in the Currency Adjustment in the Suhuai Area</h3>
<p>Nanjing, February 4th, Central News Agency: Since the issuance of the Central Reserve Bank Notes, with the continuous efforts of the financial authorities and the sincere assistance of the Allied nations, the scope of their circulation has expanded day by day, and people's faith has become increasingly firm. At present, all parts of Central and Southern China have already used Central Reserve Bank Notes as the only currency. It is now learned that the Suhuai Special Zone will also start using Central Reserve Bank Notes and United Reserve Bank Notes together from December 1st. Therefore, the scope of circulation of Central Reserve Bank Notes will extend to the Suhuai area. This move will have an epoch-making development in the entire currency policy of the national unified currency system and sound finance, and its significance is extremely significant. Minister Zhou, who is also the Minister of Finance, yesterday specially issued a solemn statement, stating the significance of this move, and expecting that after the joint use, there will be considerable achievements, and then the new issuance of United Reserve Bank Notes in the local area will be stopped, and then the exchange between the two sides will be implemented in consideration of the situation, and the Central Reserve Bank Notes will be established as the only currency. As for the exchange rate after the joint use, it will still be handled according to the rate of 100 yuan of Central Reserve Bank Notes to 18 yuan of United Reserve Bank Notes. The statement of Minister Zhou (acted by Vice Minister Chen) is recorded below:</p>
<p>In recent years, through the government's continuous efforts and the assistance of the Allied nations, the Central Reserve Bank Notes have become the only currency in Central and Southern China. However, since the adjustment of the Suhuai administration, all currencies are limited to the use of the Bank of China United Reserve Bank notes due to payment habits and the general people's property. The scope of circulation still limited to the banknotes of the Bank of China United Reserve Bank, which has a certain impact on financial circulation and material adjustment. In order to achieve greater perfection in administrative adjustment, the existing currency system of the Suhuai Special Zone will be adjusted in accordance with the following methods: From December 1, 1943, the currency of the Suhuai Special Zone will be used jointly by the Central Reserve Bank Notes and the Bank of China United Reserve Bank notes. After considerable achievements, the new issuance of Bank of China United Reserve Bank notes in the local area will be stopped. The overall exchange will be implemented on a regular basis in light of the situation at the time, with the Central Reserve Bank Notes as the only currency. The exchange rate between the Central Reserve Bank Notes and the Bank of China United Reserve Bank notes will still be handled according to the rate of 100 yuan of Reserve Bank Notes to 18 yuan of United Reserve Bank Notes. All public receipts and expenditures in the Suhuai Special Zone will also be accepted in Central Reserve Bank Notes from now on. The currency system in North and Central China will not be fundamentally changed due to this method, and the original measures of Suhuai for agricultural products in North China will not be affected by it.</p>
<p>Based on the above methods, the material exchange between Suhuai and other places will be more convenient in the future. All of our people must look up to this purpose, assist the government, and earnestly promote it, so that the government's currency policy can be completed. In addition to reporting and circulating, this is a solemn statement, and I thank the friendly government authorities for their assistance.</p>
<p>Implemented Next Month on the 1st</p>
<p>Nanjing, February 24th, Central News Agency: The Suhuai area is bounded by the port of Lianyungang in the east, Haizhou Road in the west, Nanjing and Shanghai in the south, and Pingjin in the north. It is an important military and political town in China and is densely populated with abundant products. It has always been known as the Ukraine of China. After the return of the National Government to the capital, in view of the importance of the region, a special administrative commissioner's office was established in January 1942, directly under the Executive Yuan, which governs 22 cities and counties, and engages in construction in the political, military, and economic fields. It has been almost two years since then. Thanks to the continuous efforts of all parties, it has laid the foundation for serving as the rear area construction in the Greater East Asia War. At present, there has been considerable progress in all sectors of politics, military affairs, and economy. As for the currency issue in the area, since the establishment of the Special Zone Commissioner's Office, in order to take into account the property of the general public and the convenience of payment habits, its scope of use has always been limited to the United Reserve Bank Notes in North China, which has a certain impact on financial circulation and material adjustment. Now, in order to make further improvements in the administrative adjustment of the region, the government authorities have decided to adjust the current currency system in the region. From December 1st, it is stipulated that the Central Reserve Bank Notes and the original United Reserve Bank Notes will be used together in the region. The exchange rate will still be handled according to the rate of 100 yuan of Central Reserve Bank Notes to 18 yuan of United Reserve Bank Notes. It is also stipulated that all public receipts and expenditures in the special zone will be centered on the Central Reserve Bank Notes. After considerable achievements, further consideration will be given to stopping the issuance of the United Reserve Bank Notes in the region, and further considering the situation, a comprehensive exchange will be implemented to implement the policy of the Central Reserve Bank Notes as the only currency. The authorities' decisive measures are indeed wise and appropriate. This move has significant significance in terms of unifying the currency system, improving the financial policy, and adjusting the administration and material circulation in the region. Therefore, all parties attach great importance to this move by the authorities and place deep expectations on it. It is firmly believed that after the implementation of this method, the expected effect will be that the entire currency policy of the national government to unify the currency system and stabilize the finance can be developed. The scope of circulation of Central Reserve Bank Notes will be further expanded, and a further effect will be gained on the people's faith. The character of its only legal currency will also become more and more solid. After the implementation of this measure, the administrative adjustment of the Special Zone Commissioner's Office and the financial circulation will be more perfect and smooth. Afterwards, the material exchanges between the Suhuai Special Zone and other places will also become more convenient and beneficial.</p>
<p>Allies Decide to Assist</p>
<p>Nanjing, February 24th, Central News Agency: The Japanese Embassy in China stated on the 24th regarding the National Government's adjustment of the currency in the Suhuai Special Zone that the National Government had previously set up the Suhuai Special Zone Administrative Commissioner's Office to engage in the preparation of administrative institutions, but later the currency circulating in the area was still the Bank of China United Reserve Bank Notes. From December 1st, it was decided to use the Central Reserve Bank Notes in the area, and in the future, the new issuance of the United Reserve Bank Notes will be abolished, and a comprehensive exchange of currency will be implemented to make the Central Reserve Bank Notes fully circulate in the area. The National Government's adjustment of the currency system in the Suhuai area this time is to adapt to the preparation of administrative institutions in the Suhuai area. There is no change in the current currency system in North and Central China, and the exchange rate between the two currencies will remain the same. Japan has decided to adopt all cooperative policies for this measure, seeking to promote the economic construction of the area in the future, and striving to smooth the purchase of important materials in the area and the exchange of materials with North China.</p>
<h3>Kume Masao Visits Minister Lin Xuan</h3>
<p>Nanjing, February 24th, Central News Agency: Kume Masao, a veteran of the Japanese literary world, visited Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department at his official residence at 6:30 p.m. yesterday (24th), accompanied by Kishida, the information minister of the Japanese Embassy, to discuss matters related to the Greater East Asia Writers' Conference to be held in Beijing next year. Minister Lin personally received him and had many earnest discussions on matters related to the Greater East Asia Writers' Conference next year.</p>
<h3>Allied Nations Reform Diplomatic Institutions in China Decided to Reform the Nanjing Embassy First</h3>
<p>Nanjing, February 24th, Central News Agency: The Japanese Embassy in China previously believed that after the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, Sino-Japanese relations have made new leaps forward. In order to adapt to this new stage and thoroughly realize the new policy towards China, it had previously planned to strengthen the unified operation and management of diplomatic organs in China and make organic adjustments to the organizational lineup. Therefore, it later actively carried out specific implementation policies with the embassy as the center and various offices in various places. Now, in order to respond to the central authorities of the Japanese mainland and strengthen the wartime administrative operation system, so that the local institutions tend to be simple and powerful, it has been decided to reform the Nanjing Embassy and the Shanghai Office of the Embassy first. That is, the embassy abolished the past four departments of political affairs, economy, culture and information, and changed them to two departments of general affairs and information. A survey room is set up in the information department. The position of the director of the general affairs department is filled by a minister to realize the planned strong simplicity. At the same time, the structure of the Shanghai office of the embassy is changed to the general affairs office of the official residence, the first economic department (industry and transportation), the second economic department (finance), and a part of the general affairs office is incorporated into the embassy, while a part of the general affairs of the embassy is also in charge of the Shanghai general affairs office. With regard to information, it is reduced to the format of the embassy's information department office, and all of its institutions are limited to practical measures in the economic field. In this way, the embassy and the Shanghai office of the embassy tend to be unified and close. In addition to the reform of the embassy and the Shanghai office of the embassy this time, the unification and closeness between the Beijing, Zhangjiakou, Guangdong, and major embassy offices and the embassy is expected to be realized in the near future. At the same time, due to the reform of this unified organization, Japan's diplomatic lineup in China can be centered on the ambassador, and under adapting to the new situation, it will exert its full power. It is expected that the current personnel will be fundamentally adjusted, and once it is realized, Japan's new policy towards China, which can be shown in the alliance treaty, can be expected to enter the stage of a flying practice under the unified jurisdiction of the ambassador to China.</p>

<h3>To Revive China's Economy, We Must Actively Realize China's Unification Bose Makes a Recorded Broadcast to the People of Chongqing</h3>
<p>Nanjing, February 24th, Central News Agency: Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, made his first broadcast to the people of Chongqing on the 20th night. Following this, he made a recorded broadcast to the people of Chongqing on the 23rd night. The gist of his remarks is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Gentlemen, you may know that the Chongqing dispatched troops stationed in India, standing on the same battle line with the British army, and the fact that they are fighting. If Chiang Kai-shek is really a nationalist or patriot, why would he assist the British in suppressing the Indian nationalists and send troops to India? Moreover, Chiang's assistance to the British in suppressing nationalists is not the first time. Last year, his troops cooperated with the British army in maintaining British control over Burma, but the Burmese people did not harm China. This kind of behavior will make the people of India and Burma recognize Chiang as a puppet of British imperialism.</p>
<p>In 1942, Chiang was invited by the British government to visit India to persuade Indian leaders to compromise with Britain. If Chiang had righteousness, fairness, benevolence, and love, he should have asked the British government to recognize India's independence, and at least not allow his troops stationed in India to assist the British in fighting, but in the end, he disappointed us. I believe that the unification of China and the liberation of China after the Sino-Japanese peace cannot enable the entire Asia to enter a new era, thus giving a powerful stimulus to the Indian independence struggle. Chinese nationals can also revive the economy and restore the past beauty. In view of this, I would like to tell you that all problems between China and Japan must be handled boldly and straightforwardly in accordance with the new situation.</p>
<p>Every time I talk about hoping for peace between China and Japan, it is not just my personal opinion, but the hope of all Indian people. I believe that the unification of China is a matter of urgent need today. Obstructing the work of unification is not only a crime against China, but also against India and the entire Asia. The greatest obstacle to China's unification today is the existence of the evil forces of Britain and the United States. When Britain and the United States may unify China, they often deceive the Chinese people, make all kinds of propaganda, and then make them tend to be scattered. For example, Britain announced to the world that its winter offensive on the Indian border is approaching, and that it will strengthen its assistance to Chongqing after regaining Burma and opening the Burma Road. However, I know the situation of both sides on the Indian and Burmese borders. Our brave comrades are stationed in that area. Therefore, I dare to guarantee that in the future battles, we will definitely be able to liberate the two provinces of Bengal and Assam in India from the shackles of Britain.</p>
<p>If Japan is unfortunately defeated in this war, what will happen to the future of Asia, or the future of China and India? We can understand this by referring to the past history of Asia. For example, when Japan's status is reduced from a first-class power, Britain and the United States will still use China as a tool for their own self-enrichment and co-squeeze and arbitrate, which will be even worse than in the past. Britain and the United States are still heavily publicizing that they will support Chongqing if they fail, so that it can exist in order to obtain a favorable peace, but when we analyze it a little, we can know its absurdity, because Britain and the United States will find it difficult to influence Japan even if they play any tricks. They are even propagating that "the unification of China and the peace between China and Japan are not realized, and these issues must be resolved at the end of the war," which is a conspiracy to separate China. If China is not unified, peace between China and Japan will be difficult to achieve, and China's revival and prosperity will be impossible. Those who suffer from economic hardship are the Chinese people, so if we want to revive China's economy as soon as possible, we must actively realize China's unification. Gentlemen, I earnestly hope that you will sincerely consider or accept my loyal advice, take on the important mission of China and Asia, and stand up and unite for the liberation of Asia.</p>

<h3>Japan's Promotion of Wartime Diplomacy Has Achieved Great Results The Future of Greater East Asia Is Full of Infinite Brightness</h3>
<p>Tokyo, February 24th, Central News Agency: After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan stated that the war was not only related to the interests of Japan alone, but was a war of defense and liberation for the entire Greater East Asia. Therefore, Japan's wartime Greater East Asia diplomacy was promoted based on this purpose, striving to realize the unity of Greater East Asia. As the Greater East Asia War is approaching its second year, the following is a brief description of Japan's diplomatic strategies in the past two years. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan concluded an alliance of offense and defense with Thailand on December 21, 1941 (the 30th year of the Republic of China). Therefore, Thailand determined its attitude as a weapon ally of Japan. Subsequently, Thailand declared war on Britain and the United States on January 25, 1942. For Vietnam, Japan took all-round measures based on the Japan-Vietnam joint defense agreement and various economic agreements. On the fourth day of the start of the Greater East Asia War, December 12, a Japan-Vietnam military agreement was further concluded, and then the relationship between Japan and Vietnam progressed smoothly until today. Looking at the relationship between China and Japan, before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, there was an inseparable relationship of sharing weal and woe. On January 9 of this year, China resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States, and Japan implemented its new policy towards China. The relationship between China and Japan entered a relationship of one body of life and death. On October 30, China and Japan re-established an alliance treaty, opening the first page of a new history in the relationship between China and Japan. In addition, Japan concluded alliance treaties with Burma, which became independent on August 1, and the Philippines, which became independent on October 14, respectively. On October 23, it took the lead in recognizing the Provisional Government of Free India, which was established on October 21, clarifying its determination to support India's independence movement. Japan's ideas have been proven to be gradually realized. Now, Greater East Asia has formed a family-like group. Its concrete manifestation is the Greater East Asia Conference held in Tokyo on November 5 and 6 and the Greater East Asia Declaration, which represents the general will of one billion people in East Asia. The profoundness and greatness of its ideals are beyond the reach of the enemy's Atlantic Charter and the Moscow Four-Power Joint Declaration. In short, the Greater East Asia Conference and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration are the results of a consistent diplomatic policy. In the future, Japan's Greater East Asia diplomacy will definitely advance in accordance with this policy, and it goes without saying that it will strive to popularize it throughout the world.</p>
<p>The More Britain and the United States' Policies Fail, the More Anxious and Uneasy They Become</p>
<p>Looking at the relationship between Japan and Manchuria, Manchuria issued an imperial edict on the day the war broke out. Later, on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the founding of Manchuria, His Majesty the Emperor of Japan sent Prince Takamatsu to Manchuria on May 26, 1942 to express his congratulations. At the same time, China, Japan, Manchuria, and Thailand exchanged envoys with each other. In this way, the unity of Greater East Asia became increasingly consolidated. Among them, the most noteworthy is the new policy towards China implemented by Japan after China's participation in the war on January 9 of this year. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, Japan appointed Shigitsu Aoi, the former ambassador to the United Kingdom, as the ambassador to China. In November 1942, the Greater East Asia Ministry was established to seek strong unification of diplomacy. In this way, Japan's consistent diplomatic policy has entered the stage of practicing the principle of mutual benefit and equality in China. Japan has liquidated all unequal treaties, allowing China to escape the shackles of a century and gain complete liberation. Japan's realization of this fair policy is also shared by many countries that still have remaining rights and interests in China, such as Italy, France, and Spain, which have successively adopted the same measures as Japan and returned their special rights and interests in China. The cunning Britain and the United States, based on Japan's righteous act, also verbally abolished all unequal treaties with Chongqing. This proves that Japan's Greater East Asia diplomacy has completely defeated the enemy in terms of policy. In short, in the past two years, Japan's wartime Greater East Asia diplomacy has now achieved great results. Britain and the United States, engaged in meaningless wars, have expressed surprise at this and have become increasingly uneasy and anxious. The future of Greater East Asia is full of infinite brightness.</p>

<h3>Landing on Kilberte Island: Damages to US Forces Deeply Veiled</h3>
<p>Argentina Capital City, 24th (Central News Agency) – In an attempt to conceal the significant damages suffered by US warships and aircraft during the landing operations on Gilbert Island, the United States has maintained silence since the 23rd. This has led to a general perception that US forces have completely secured naval and air supremacy. According to dispatches from Washington, US Navy Secretary Knox stated during a meeting with a group of reporters on the 23rd that the landing on Gilbert Island marked the beginning of a new offensive. This offensive aims to directly attack the Japanese mainland through the central Pacific. The objectives of this offensive are twofold: first, to expel Japanese forces from the mandated territories of the Marshall and Caroline Islands; and second, to shorten the US supply lines in the Southwest Pacific. He also hinted at acknowledging that most of the objectives of the Gilbert Island operation had been thwarted, stating that the Gilbert Island operation has not yet encountered resistance from the Japanese fleet, and the US attempt to launch a decisive battle was unsuccessful. Furthermore, according to dispatches from New York, The New York Times editorial on the 23rd stated: The Gilbert Island operation is believed to be a naval challenge by the US against Japan, attempting to bring a short-term end to the Pacific War. This attempt fundamentally contradicts Japanese naval strategy.</p>
<p>Argentina Capital City, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to dispatches from Pearl Harbor, the US Pacific Fleet Headquarters announced on the 22nd that the US forces landing on the Gilbert Islands consist of the Second Marine Division and the 27th Infantry Division of the Army, which had been operating in the Guadalcanal and Solomon Islands waters.</p>
<h3>Burmese Government Announces Key Financial Policies: Exerting Total Financial Strength to Accomplish the War</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Burmese government announced key financial policies on the 22nd, based on the fundamental national policy guidelines, to exert the total financial strength of the nation in order to advance towards the final goal of accomplishing the Greater East Asia War. The main points regarding the policies and plans that the government has already begun to implement and will soon implement are as follows: The budget deficit for this year is approximately 146 million rupees. However, the expenditures include funds for purchasing rice and establishing a central bank, which are incorporated into the expenditures. Therefore, the actual deficit is only half of the nominal figure, and the most significant reason for the deficit is the increase in national defense funds. To enhance national defense, the government plans to raise 30 million rupees, making the national defense burden 70% of the revenue. Issuing savings bonds: The government will first raise 2 million rupees through government savings bonds to support financial operations. Simultaneously, it will encourage citizens to actively save. These bonds will soon be issued nationwide, and citizens have already purchased 700,000 rupees worth of temporary securities. Establishing a central bank: Pre-war plans to establish a central bank in Burma were obstructed by Britain and could not be realized. Now that Burma has regained independence, it is preparing to establish a central bank with a capital of 10 million rupees. It is expected to be established soon. This is a necessary step to develop Burma’s commerce and industry and to resolve post-war reconstruction issues. Establishing a wartime insurance system: All government officials are required to join the insurance program, with very favorable terms. The main goal of this system is to increase government revenue, and its purpose is to guarantee the livelihood of the families supported by government officials, while also promoting a habit of thrift.</p>

In addition, all members of the Embassy, including Minister Xie Zuyuan, participated. After declaring the meeting open at 10:00 AM on the 24th, the ceremony was conducted as scheduled. Ambassador Cai delivered an opening address, stating that the First Consular Conference was held in March two and a half years ago. Since then, Sino-Japanese relations have significantly improved. China was able to recover concessions and abolish extraterritoriality, all thanks to Japan’s cooperation. Recently, due to the conclusion of the Alliance Treaty, the relations between the two countries have become even closer. Therefore, it is necessary to enrich and improve the institutions of various consulates and the lives of overseas nationals. He hoped that all consuls would enthusiastically discuss the proposals and earnestly promote them so that Sino-Japanese relations could be promoted and the lives of overseas nationals could be improved. Subsequently, addresses were given by Minister Xie and others. After a break, the meeting continued at 2:00 PM. After the consuls reported in succession, the discussion of the proposals began, totaling more than thirty items. The main ones included the proposals on overseas nationals cooperating in the Greater East Asia War, overseas Chinese commerce, overseas Chinese remittances, and overseas Chinese education, submitted by the Yokohama Consulate General and others. To facilitate the proceedings, the Ambassador designated a small committee to conduct separate reviews, to be presented to the plenary session for a vote tomorrow. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM today.</p>
<h3>Newspaper Congress Representatives Visit Uji-Yamada</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a Nagoya telephone report, representatives attending the Greater East Asia Newspaper Congress visited an airplane manufacturing factory on the morning of the 24th. At noon, they attended a welcome reception hosted by the Nagoya City Chamber of Commerce and Industry. At 2:30 PM, they left Nagoya for Uji-Yamada.

<h3>Redefinition of Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth Types: Both Are Stipulated to be 29 Types</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) – Regarding the production and allocation measures for cotton products, although they have been formulated and promulgated by the National Government, the production of various factories can be implemented. However, in the past, there were a wide variety of cotton yarn and cloth types. Now, to adapt to the wartime system, concentrate production, and increase efficiency, the authorities have redefined the production types for which various factories are allocated. It is stipulated that there will be 17 types of cotton yarn and 12 types of cotton cloth. The manufacture of types other than these is prohibited. This will change the arbitrary consumption of the liberal economic era and eliminate the pursuit of profits and competition. With this, the greatest efforts will be made to maximize production capacity.</p>

<h3>Berlin Suffers Another Terrorist Air Raid Last Night: Germany Vows to Retaliate</h3>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) – The German Headquarters announced: Berlin was attacked again by British aircraft last night, causing fires and damage in several parts of the city. In addition to many residential buildings, public buildings, churches, charitable organizations, and artistic monuments were destroyed in several places. Nineteen enemy aircraft were shot down.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) – The British Air Force bombed Berlin again on the night of the 23rd, causing damage in many places. The German authorities anticipated this move and had made adequate air defense preparations in advance. The entire city had taken effective measures for firefighting and property protection. According to authorities, the British bomber squadrons were attacked by German anti-aircraft fire upon entering German territory, and many British bombers were shot down.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) – A German military spokesman stated at a press conference that the increasing number of terrorist air raids has forced us to take retaliatory measures.</p>
<h3>German Forces Successfully Encircle Kiev: Soviet Forces Launch New Offensive in the Dnieper Bend</h3>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency, military report: As a result of the large-scale encirclement attack carried out by German forces west of Kiev yesterday, a large number of enemy troops have been surrounded. Units of the German Tank Division destroyed or captured 30 tanks, 6 cannons, and 40 other artillery pieces, and captured many enemy soldiers.

The Soviet forces gained some temporary advantages, but the German forces repelled them after launching a counter-offensive. In the Kiev area, the German forces overcame strong Soviet resistance under adverse weather conditions and achieved successful progress.

<h3>Current Status of Canada and Brazil</h3>
<p>Canada</p>
<p>In the Western Hemisphere, the United States and Great Britain are actively preparing for wartime conditions. To the north is Canada, and to the south is Brazil. Within Canada, there is inherent opposition between the British and French factions. From the perspective of Great Britain and the United States, this opposition is like a thorn in the eye. Out of Canada's total population of 11 million, 2.9 million are of French descent. The French faction, centered in Quebec in eastern Canada, advocates for limiting aid to Great Britain, which has considerable influence in Canadian politics today. The dispatch of Canadian soldiers abroad is limited to volunteers, and those who do not wish to be sent overseas cannot be forcibly dispatched. When the Japanese army attacked Hong Kong, the Canadian army was nearly annihilated. At that time, French-Canadian politicians used this as ammunition to attack the government. Furthermore, in Dieppe, northern France, 80% of the British troops were Canadian, and they suffered great losses, similarly causing a stir in Canadian political circles. The Canadian army numbers approximately 75,000, with three cumulative shipments totaling 45,000 sent to Great Britain. The Canadian soldiers who participated in the Sicilian campaign were also part of this force.</p>
<p>Aircraft and Shipbuilding</p>
<p>Canada contributes aircraft and shipbuilding to Great Britain and the United States. Although shipbuilding has been heard of in Canada, Halifax, Saint John, Vancouver, and Victoria, among others, the manufacturing of bombers seems to be a recent development. To date, Canada has transported a cumulative total of 500 to 1,000 aircraft to Great Britain. Although aircraft manufacturing is not yet significant in number, training is conducted by Great Britain and the United States. There are approximately 30 to 40 flight schools in Canada.</p>
<p>Looking at the economic aspect, aside from a lack of population, there seems to be no hand-to-mouth existence. The rationing system mainly applies to meat, coal, and gasoline, and the restrictions are fairly lenient. Canada has both coal and oil, and coal is also supplied to Pennsylvania in the United States. Therefore, there is no sense of shortage. Private automobiles are limited to three gallons of gasoline per week. Flour and wheat are Canada's main products, monopolized for export to Great Britain. Controls on general prices, salaries, and wages have been in place since September 1940, seemingly progressing more methodically than the haphazard approach in the United States. The United States uses Canada's price controls as a model. Due to a labor shortage, there are many female laborers, which is also common in Canada. In Canada, women becoming laborers is still something to be proud of.</p>
<p>Brazil</p>
<p>At the end of January last year, on the final day of the Rio Conference, Brazil severed diplomatic relations with the Axis powers. In August of the same year, it declared war on Germany. The shortage of materials is quite serious in Brazil. In mid-July last year, due to a shortage of gasoline, the use of private automobiles was banned. At that time, when news footage showed Roosevelt's speech, the audience shouted, "What about gasoline?" Brazil's resources have never been plentiful, and the anti-American sentiment of the people toward the United States is widespread. Looking at its material shortage: Gasoline for business trips is limited to 30 kilometers per week. Since June of this year, sugar is rationed at two kilograms per person per month, and bread is also rationed. Meat, butter, and salt are in great shortage, and people line up to buy them. As a result of severing diplomatic relations and declaring war on Germany, Brazil has only experienced domestic material shortages. Brazil previously had approximately 5 million tons of shipping traffic annually, but today it has been reduced to 1.25 million tons. According to government announcements, import taxes have been reduced by 60%.</p>
<p>Difficult to be Optimistic About the Future</p>
<p>In agriculture, coffee has been greatly impacted, and cotton is also in decline. Mint and raw silk are products with wartime prosperity. The cultivation of rubber in the Amazon region, which the United States has repeatedly promoted, is entirely empty talk. At most, there will be a harvest of 50,000 tons. The optimistic material that will remove the industry from the United States is still far off.</p>
<p>The largest of the military bases supplied by Brazil to the United States is Natal in the north. There are two views on whether Brazilian troops will be dispatched overseas, especially to Africa, the details of which are unknown. It seems certain that no troops have been dispatched overseas other than volunteers. The United States made a bold statement that Brazil would be transformed into an airplane and warship manufacturing base, but given the current state of Brazil's lack of weapons, it is nothing more than empty talk. Brazil has a total of three battleships, one of which sank, one of which was seriously damaged, and one of which is of unknown location. Brazil's merchant ships have been heavily hit by submarine attacks, as have other South American countries such as Argentina. Brazil's shipbuilding capacity is weak, and it is difficult to recover this loss in a short period of time. Brazil's shipbuilding capacity is only capable of building small destroyers. From this point of view, Brazil's contribution to the United States is very weak. 機—(翔：驛自十一月十大日西部朝日新) (Roughly: Translated from the November 10th Western Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Italian Ships Not Suitable for Pacific Operations</h3>
<p>Rome, 24th (Central News Agency) – A special correspondent of the Maritime News Agency learned from well-informed Italian naval sources that Italian warships that have fallen into British and American hands cannot be used in the Pacific. Firstly, the ammunition required by Italian ships is specially manufactured by Italy, and the ammunition stored on board is only sufficient for one major battle. Secondly, Italian ships are designed specifically for use in the Mediterranean and cannot withstand the rough seas of the Pacific. Sending these ships to the Pacific would be a futile sacrifice.</p>
<h3>Reports of French Head of State Pétain’s Resignation are Inaccurate</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from the Maritime News Agency: The French embassy here formally denied the reports that Marshal Pétain would resign as the French Head of State. The French embassy announced to the press that Pétain is in good health, and all rumors are untrue.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance, Taxation Department: Adjusts Cigarette Tax Policy: Cigarette Unified Tax Changed from Five Levels to Three Levels of Taxation</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report – The Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, in order to adjust cigarette tax policy, has changed the cigarette unified tax levels from five to three. The tax rate standards will still be in accordance with previous methods. The first level will be taxed at 55.5% of the price, the second level will be taxed at 50% of the price, and the third level will be taxed at 45% of the price. The fourth and fifth levels will be eliminated. However, the previously estimated prices of various cigarettes differ greatly from the current market prices. Therefore, the department recently convened a price evaluation committee to review and re-estimate the standard prices for cigarette taxation. It is reported that the minimum estimated price is set at 4,000 yuan per  (50,000 cigarettes) to allow  registration and payment of cigarette stamp tax.</p>
<h3>Feng Jie Goes to Manchuria to Inspect Film and Cultural Enterprises; Kawakita and Zhang Shankun Accompany Him</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Propaganda of the National Government, having dispatched its advisor (Vice Minister of the Central Propaganda Department) and General Manager of China Film Corporation, Feng Jie, to Japan in August to inspect film and cultural propaganda enterprises, which was very successful, has now sent him again, accompanied by Vice Chairman of China Film Corporation, Nagamasa Kawakita, and Deputy General Manager, Zhang Shankun, along with staff member Rong Xu, to Manchuria to complete the same mission. Feng and his party of four flew to Beiping yesterday morning, the 24th, and are scheduled to stay in Beiping for several days to inspect film business in North China before proceeding to Xinjing. Feng's visit to North China and Manchuria includes discussions with local authorities on cooperative plans, which is of great significance to the future development of the Chinese film business, and a major harvest is expected. The China Film Corporation originally planned to convene a temporary shareholders' meeting in early December to report on the increase in capital and amendments to the articles of association, but now, because Kawakita, Feng, and Zhang were unable to [arrive] in time, it has been decided to postpone the meeting to around the 10th of next month.</p>

<p>Yesterday's News Time: 7:30</p>
<p>Economic Circles' Comments</p>
<h3>On Winter Relief</h3>
<p>Recently, all sectors of society have taken a positive view of the winter relief campaign. Under the leadership of Mayor Chen, a "Winter Relief Expenditure Fundraising Committee" has been established, and influential figures in the economic sector and leaders in various industries have been appointed as team leaders to start fundraising work immediately. This measure benefits society and blesses the poor, which is not a superficial benefit. At this time of cold winds and freezing weather, the poor who are suffering from hunger and cold are waiting for our relief, looking forward like clouds and rainbows. I hope that this campaign can be launched and promoted quickly, because people in the economic sector have greater strength. If they can take the lead in advocating and leading the community, the impact will surely alleviate the economic malaise of the grassroots society.</p>
<p>Historically, winter relief measures have been nothing more than providing clothing and food, because clothing and food are the most pressing issues for people's livelihoods and cannot be delayed for a day. Therefore, although winter relief is a social welfare issue, it is also a social economic issue. We advocate that attention should be paid to improving the formulation of winter relief measures, the rectification of personnel, and the strengthening of institutions, and that the target of relief should be as widespread as possible, and the procedures for relief should be as swift as possible. This is the principle of making relief easy, which is what we expect from those in charge of the mining affairs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, relief is a passive measure. Even if it is done perfectly, it is still just a charitable act. Therefore, from a proactive perspective, in addition to ensuring that the old and weak without dependents are properly cared for, efforts should be made to reduce the number of unemployed young and middle-aged people, so that they have jobs and can participate in production, rather than being a burden on society. Therefore, the industrial and commercial circles should accommodate this large number of laborers as much as possible, so that they become productive members. The government authorities should provide all possible support based on the principle of stabilizing people's livelihoods during wartime.</p>
<h3>Large Amount of Floating Capital in the City Invested in Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry; Will Reach 100 Million Yuan in Two Months</h3>
<p>Since the government authorities strictly prohibited speculative hoarding, the large amount of floating capital in the hands of capitalists in this city lost its foothold. Especially during the government's purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, countless floating capital escaped from hoarding goods, and they all had nowhere to go and were extremely panicked.</p>
<p>But in the last [blank] month, this floating capital has gradually found its destination. Part of it flows into the interior to purchase real estate, and part of it is due to the recent increase in capital of various banks, money shops, and various enterprises in Shanghai, and invested in financial businesses and industrial and commercial enterprises.</p>
<p>Although there is still a part of the floating capital still active in speculative trading, the number is extremely small. But as of today, speculative trading in the market has reached the final stage of struggle, and the danger of its arrival often comes unexpectedly. Therefore, investors with better vision are willing to invest their capital in areas that are not affected by the environment</p>
<p>Agriculture, Forestry and Animal Husbandry</p>
<p>The agriculture, forestry and animal husbandry industry is more reliable than other industries, whether in wartime or peacetime. Therefore, according to experts' estimates, in the next two months, the investment of capitalists in this city in the above-mentioned enterprises will reach a huge amount of 100 million yuan. This is the most reasonable destination for Shanghai's floating capital and a good sign for the country's economic future.</p>

<h3>Editorial - (Continued from Page One)</h3>
<p>One such attempt is their so-called "non-Party policy," for example, through the pronouncements and actions of influential non-Party figures such as Li Jishen, Bai Chongxi, Feng Yuxiang, and Sun Ke, to propagate their own主張. However, another attempt by the Chinese Communist Party regarding cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is the "Tactical Path of the Chinese Communist Party," which was exposed by the CC Clique of the Kuomintang in March 1938. It is said that the booklet written under this title is based on notes taken from lectures given by Zhang Hao at the Anti-Japanese University. In that book, the nature of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is defined as follows. Because it is quite important for grasping the essence of Kuomintang-Communist cooperation, we will publish the full text without hesitation.</p>
<p>"The current compromise and cooperation between the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang in the stage of the War of Resistance is by no means a surrender, nor is it a betrayal of the interests of the proletariat. Therefore, its meaning is as follows: Abandoning the difficult revolutionary line and seeking an easier path towards the dictatorship of the proletariat (Proletariat).</p>
<p>Through open work, cover the development of secret work, strive for the power of the broad masses of the people, and seek to subvert the政權 of the bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>Give the revolution a time to recuperate. During this period, it is necessary to conserve strength and prepare for new conditions for advancement.</p>
<p>Temporarily abandon obvious offensive tactics, adopt defensive tactics, and soon change again and adopt offensive tactics.</p>
<p>When the struggle is exhausting, it is necessary to rest and recuperate to preserve revolutionary strength; therefore, temporarily abandon the revolutionary system, abandon the superficial name, and preserve its substance, in order to seek even greater victories in the future.</p>
<p>The Red Army's change of name to the National Revolutionary Army is only a change of 番號, not a change in編制. The Red Army still maintains its independence and strives to expand and strengthen it even further. The change of the Soviet to a Special Zone government is also not a change in its essence, and especially not a weakening of the power of the proletariat, but rather a development of the revolutionary power of a broader mass of people.</p>
<p>The current compromise is to lift the current ban on parties, release political prisoners, strive for freedom of assembly, association, and speech, and improve people's lives. All of this is beneficial to the proletarian revolution and is a preparation for the realization of the dictatorship of the proletariat.</p>
<p>In short, the current compromise is to isolate the Kuomintang, establish a democratic republic, and overthrow the one-party dictatorship of the Kuomintang government, in order to realize the dictatorship of the proletariat."</p>
<p>After this document was published, Zhou Enlai was quite disturbed and issued an open letter, arguing that the document was handwritten by Japanese special agents. However, who else but a member of the Chinese Communist Party could write a document that expresses the CCP's realistic policies in this way? If it were the Japanese special agency during the Russo-Japanese War (when Lenin and Japanese General Akashi, who infiltrated Russia, had contact – Yoshida note), then perhaps it would be possible. However, I think Zhou Enlai himself knows better than anyone whether today's Japanese special agency can write such subtle things. The ideas expressed in the book, such as "once the Kuomintang cannot be used, it will be discarded like squeezed-out orange pulp," truly depict the CCP's方針 in great detail. No matter how flowery the CCP's words are, it has no intention of cooperating with the Kuomintang permanently, as past history has proven.</p>
<p>The Different Standpoints of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party</p>
<p>As mentioned above, at the China Problems Committee in 1927, Stalin said: "The Russian Communist Party and the Communist International, in reality, do not like to support the policies of the national bourgeoisie. As long as the Chinese revolution is a revolution of a united front of the whole people, it is necessary to adopt a policy of utilizing the national bourgeoisie." He clearly admitted that the subject of "adopting a policy of utilizing the Chinese national bourgeoisie" is "the Russian Communist Party and the Communist International," and inadvertently expressed that it is standing on the standpoint of "the Russian Communist Party and the Communist International" to deal with Chinese problems. This is not the author's intention to quote out of context. It is precisely because this tendency exists within the CCP that it became the main factor in the Zhang Guotao incident that occurred in April 1938. Why did Zhang Guotao break away from the CCP and join the Kuomintang? Regarding his motives, he himself said the following: "Recalling the summer of the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China, when the First Front Army led by Mao Zedong and the Fourth Front Army led by me met in western Sichuan, conflicts of opinion had already occurred between the two. Mao Zedong said that the "Long March" was a victory and advocated entering Shaanxi, where a Soviet Republic must be re-established on the Sichuan-Shaanxi-Gansu base. I said that the "Long March" was a failure and firmly advocated that we be stationed in the western Sichuan-Xikang area, requesting a truce with the Central Army, a united front against foreign aggression, and the realization of the anti-Japanese policy. Because of this conflict of opinions, the CCP formed a divided situation. In December of that year (the twenty-fourth year of the Republic of China – Yoshida note), because the Third International (Third International) decided on the方針 of the Anti-Japanese National United Front, this dispute gradually disappeared, and finally the First, Second, and Fourth Front Armies joined forces in Shaanxi... However, after the outbreak of the War of Resistance, Mao Zedong's maintenance of the CCP's independence and autonomy, and the CCP's spirit of establishing a separate entity that does not value the nation and the people, increasingly alienated me from his opinions. Therefore, I disregarded everything, resolutely broke away from Yan'an, and came to Wuhan."</p>
<p>Based on the above two quotations, it can be understood that the CCP's方針 for the Chinese revolution is ultimately not determined by a standpoint of "valuing the nation and the people," but by a world revolutionary standpoint centered on the Soviet Union. Kuomintang-Communist cooperation can only continue when the Kuomintang's standpoint and the CCP's world revolutionary standpoint have a consistent objective situation. However, when these two standpoints are inconsistent in China, friction and struggles will inevitably break out between the two. And the examples are truly too numerous to mention. In the past, when Japanese envoy Matsuoka and Stalin shook hands and exchanged pleasantries in Moscow and concluded the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact, were there still people who thought this was beneficial to China, which was resisting Japan? Although everyone knew that it was not beneficial, the CCP never criticized the Soviet Union for half a sentence regarding the Neutrality Pact. From this point, it can also be seen that the standpoints of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are different.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from the pure theory of democracy, of course, many political parties can coexist in one country. However, if each political party owns its own army and holds its own government, then it has long ceased to be a unified country. Sovereignty, territory, and people are the three major elements of a country. Therefore, the CCP, which actually possesses these three major elements, claims that it is not a country. This is just as much self-deception as holding stolen goods in one's hands and saying that one is not a robber. From the jurisprudence of democracy, it is clear that two countries are coexisting in anti-Japanese China. It is not that there are two political parties in one country, but simply a domestic conflict between two countries seeking unification under one government. Although the unification of China has been the ardent desire of the 400 million Chinese people since the revolution of the Republic of China, and although they regard it as the highest goal of the War of Resistance, the real state of anti-Japanese China is nothing more than the division of China. Two political parties, no, two countries, both believe in their future prospects, and ultimately must eliminate the other. Only under this situation have the two sides concluded a temporary ceasefire agreement.</p>
<p>Now the Soviet Union is fighting to the death with Japan's ally, Germany. If, at this time, Chongqing requests peace with Japan, then although this is very urgent for the fate of China, the CCP will inevitably take an opposing stance. Therefore, if the Chongqing government compromises with Japan, the ceasefire agreement between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will be torn up immediately, and they will inevitably fall into a state of war. This is known to everyone. The Chinese Communist Party is the督戰隊 forcing Chongqing to continue fighting Japan. If Chongqing wants to show even a slight degree of怠工 (Sabotage) against the anti-Japanese war, then the CCP, like the old man of the sea that Sindbad the Sailor carries on his shoulders in the legends of "Arabian Nights," will forcefully tighten Chongqing's head and make it unable to breathe. As long as Chongqing cannot get rid of this monstrous old man, the CCP, then compromise with Japan is absolutely impossible. However, as long as Chongqing carries this old man on its shoulders, Chongqing will be exhausted and at the command of the old man on its shoulders, and will have to move in the direction indicated by the old man until it is exhausted and collapses to the ground. This is the "fate of Chongqing" built on Kuomintang-Communist cooperation. — (Translated by Ji) (End of this section)</p>
