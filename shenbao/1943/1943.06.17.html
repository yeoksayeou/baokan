<h3 id="c1">日本臨時議會開幕 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>日本第八十二屆臨時議會，業於本月十五日正式宣告開慕，自十六日至十八日開會三天。據電訉簡略的報道，可知這次會議中，首先提出政府建議的法律案八件，預算案三件，並由陸海軍兩相報吿大東亞戰局之各方面戰况。現在會議尚在進行之間，自然未能妄加推測與批評，但就目前東亞大局而論，這次日本臨時議會之召開，實具有極重要之意義。正向協力完遂大東亞戰爭之途邁進的我國人民，尤當有最正確的認識。</p>
<p>目前國際大局，非常明顯，無論是在東亞或歐洲，都已面臨決戰的前夕。無論敵我兩方，都在爲準備決戰而在政治上，軍事上，外交上，以至本國與盟國的經濟上，加强準備活動。在歐洲方面，地中海的慘烈的空戰，德蘇前綫的形勢也在日趨緊張中，而地中海東西兩端的中立國的動態，尤爲世界視綫所集中。但是，我們現在可以說：所有這些歐洲方面的動態，及由這些動態而發生的問題，例如中立國的趨向如何？軸心國的戰略與兩綫作戰的實力如何？乃至英美可能開闢「第二戰綫」的實際趨向如何？凡此種種，決定趨勢的重點，至少有一半是繫於東亞的局勢。所有上述問題，要獲得正確的答案，每一個人都必須看看東亞的情勢，英美儘管大吹大擂的說什麼「開闢第二戰綫」，「歐洲登陸作戰」，但是，他們却不能不分出最大的力量來考慮「日本的第二步動作」，他們不能不分出大部份的兵力來增防印度，他們也不能不分出相當的海空軍到澳洲西北那些叢莽之區，他們不僅嘆息着重慶方面戰略的劣勢，並且還不能不把美國全國兵力的最大部份，甚至海軍的全力放在太平洋上！這樣，日本今日一切作爲、對於歐洲乃至全世界戰局的影響之重大，已經很顯而易見了。</p>
<p>東亞的動態，將決定歐洲的動態！日本今日，實担負着未來歷史的決定者的使命！</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭開始以來，一年有半，由於日本海陸空軍將士的忠勇作戰，更由於東亞被壓迫民族對於反英美戰爭的認識與協力，已經收獲歷史上空前的大戰果，在軍事政治方面，漸漸的已經構成了必勝的體制，同時更積極的推進大東亞建設的基礎工作。當此面臨決戰之際，日本第八十二屆議會之召開，東條首相與陸海兩相的報告，不僅將爲日本臣民與東亞民族所重視，而且中立各國，歐洲的軸心國家乃至敵國英美，也將同樣的注意。同時，追加預算三案之決議，政府建議八案之決議，都將發生對東亞前途與世界戰局極重大的影響。</p>
<p>據本月十四日日本情報局發表，昭和十八年度（一九四三）一般會計及各特別會計的追加預算，歲入歲出均達六億二千萬圓，總預算突破一百三十八億圓（一百三十八億九千五百萬圓），而財源中之赤字公債不過三億一千三百二十二萬圓，加計鐵道公債等追加發行額在內，本年度公債發行總額爲二百十八億六千餘萬圓。日本這樣巨額預算，充分表現出「決戰財政」的特點，因爲就追加預算的內容來看，（甲）一般會計：內務省四百萬圓，大藏省三百萬圓，農林省四億九千一百萬圓，商工省六千三百萬圓，厚生省五千七百萬圓，共計六億二千萬圓；（乙）特別會計：朝鮮總督府一億四千萬圓，朝鮮食糧管理三億六千八百萬元，台灣總督府四千三百萬圓，台灣米穀移出管理一千六百萬圓，國債整理基金四億二千萬圓，公債金四億四千萬圓，帝國鐵道二百萬圓。（以上百萬圓以下未計，依據同盟社東京本月十四日電　十五日大陸新報。）綜合這些項目與數字來看，可說完全集中在增强戰力，整備企業及澈底的增加糧食生產等費用上面的。</p>
<p>至於政府方面，政府建設的八件法律案，雖未公表，但據同盟社本月十四日東京電，已明確報道，其主旨在於强化充實舉國決戰體制。回顧今春八十一屆議會以來，友邦日本當局，對外則實施對華新政策，加强中日滿東亞軸心三國的協力體制，進而對南方諸國，以緬甸及菲島開始，結成貫澈大東亞戰爭與解放協力的鞏固的合作；而對內則强化內閣的地位，强化舉國一致體制。今日面臨決戰的重大局勢，無疑的八十二屆議會更將貫澈以往的精神，鞏固一億日本國民及十億大東亞民族的團結，在決戰階段，造成一條保衛東亞的鋼鍊。我們深信，在本屆議會中，將由日本政府與翼政會之渾然一體、日本政府與人民之團結，使議會表示强大的方量，對於中日及東亞諸民族的團結，也將有更良好與令人興奮的啓示。</p>
<p>我們深信日本八十二屆議會將獲得空前的成果，我們所盼望的，是在這決戰階段之始，中國的政府，與民衆力量，能夠進一步團結起來，進而成爲東亞決戰中一支主力軍，與友邦及東亞諸民族更切實的協力，克服一切艱難，向最後勝利邁進。</p>

<h3 id="c2">東條首相發表施政演説　闡明日政府所抱信念　決率領全國國民爭取最後勝利　並與中國携手向共同目的猛進 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日第八十二屆臨時議會，本日上午舉行開院典禮後，貴衆兩院於下午二時及四時分別舉行全體會議，日本東條首相，亦分別於兩院發表施政演說，向中外闡明日政府之所信，首述大東亞戰爭之現階段，公開說明大東亞建設之現狀，共榮圈內各國家各民族之動向，以及日本對此所採取之新施策之全貌，最後表明日本政府之決意，決率領全國國民傾舉全力，向完成征戰之途勇往邁進。茲誌首相演詞大意如次，大東亞戰爭發生以來，迄今適一年有半，我軍將士已在御稜威下佔領並確保廣大之地域，而獲得光輝之戰果，余願於此，與諸君同對前綫將士之不辭勞苦，與英勇善戰，衷心深致謝忱。但有許多勇士，爲建立此光輝偉勳，已爲國捐軀，成爲護國之神，尤以　山本聯合艦隊司令長官在南方最前綫之壯烈殉國，及山崎部隊長以下將士，在阿圖島之悲壯殉國，最令我國民振奮。凡我日本國民，每一憶及此許多忠勇義怨之將士悲壯殉國時，莫不誓志踏先烈遺血，繼續前進。我國旣有此等勇士，又有願踏先烈遺血前進之人民，則從事大東亞戰爭，必能獲得最後勝利。余於此緬懷山本元帥及諸陣亡將士之殊勳於哀悼之餘，更決心向打倒英美之途邁進，以慰諸先烈在天之靈。今我國已在御稜威下於大東亞各也，確立戰略上必勝之態勢，且比種態勢，日益强化，大東亞豐富之資原，亦已從速開發，用以强化戰力，而我國在東亞確立此種態勢，將迅以制英美之死命，故英美今日目睹我國在大東亞之發展，如此迅速，深爲驚愕，爲謀阻止計，已舉其唯一依賴之全部物質力量，不擇手段，盡一切之策謀，屢次欲行反攻，殊不知早爲我國所預期者，我國已利用敵軍此種反攻之機會，隨時隨地將其擊潰，復又採取使敵軍屈服之手段，現我軍已在中國方面，印緬邊境方面，及太平洋各方面，展開大规模作戰，復將重創敵方，是則戰局將愈趨重大，戰鬥益愈趨壯烈，故此際實爲我一億國民共赴國難，以必勝之信念，發揮國民傳統忠烈精神之秋。爲適應以上之情勢，余與諸君必明確指出，英美內在之深刻苦惱，我人於必勝確信之下，決始終盡其全力，以爭取精神戰爭之最後勝利，直至英美屈服而後止，以安聖慮。目前縱觀大東亞之動向，各國家民族，對於日本之信賴，及對於完遂大東亞戰爭自動所作之眞摯協助，刻正在日益增强中，余於最近曾歷訪中華民國，滿洲國，及菲島等地，而得親睹各地現狀，並與各國當局，開　懇談，因而使余此項確信，更趨堅固，日本不動之方針，在使大東亞全域，自英美之桎梏下，獲得永遠解放，而恢復吾人之本來面目。日本之施策，始終一貫根據此項旣定方針，男往邁進，以迄於今日，大東亞戰爭勃發迄今，已一年有半，時至今日，大東亞十億民衆，已了解日本眞意，確信若大東亞戰爭未能完遂，則東亞無從獲得解放，大東亞新秩序自亦無從建設，大東亞民族，即無幸福之可言。此項確信，現正日益澎漲，此爲大東亞而言，實至堪同慶者也。日本爲對付以上之情勢，以應各國家民族之誠意與協助，故於此際，認爲有實施日施策之必要。今擬就其主要者，將政政府所信，坦白奉吿諸君。以言滿洲國，該國並我國爲親邦，皇帝陛下躬親先示垂範，該國國民已一致在物質精神兩方面，協助我國貢獻良多，我國並已協助該國作健全之發展，是日滿兩國邦交，極其緊密。以言中華民國，全國官民，均在汪主席領導下，各就本位，努力對於我國所取之誠意態度，莫不深表感激，今已在中日共同宣言之精神下，與我國携手，向完成共同目的猛進，友邦中華民國百年來受英美之侵略，備嘗塗炭之苦，但今已掙脫其覊絆，力求自强，並以完全自主獨立之國家資格，與我國互相提携，而欲於建設大東亞上，充分發揮其實力，良以中國民衆多年來之宿願及其　想，業已實現，。最近有龐炳勳孫殿英榮子恒等將軍以及其他許多人士，相繼脫離渝方，擁護汪主席，此已充分表明復興中國之當然歸趨。友邦中國，獲得此種興隆，爲中國及大東亞前途，以及世界全人類均堪慶賀，我國此際，除對友邦中國之此種興降衷心祝賀外，並決定今後加倍予以支援，並擬對中日兩國所訂立之條约，從根本上予以改訂，俾兩國之協力關係，更趨緊密。其次關於泰國者，則該國刻已淸除多年來與英美間複雜微妙之關係，斷然與帝國携手同進，在畢本首相統率下，克服重重之障碍與困難，挺身努力於完遂大東亞戰爭，余對此深表敬意。帝國今後亦深望與該國之提携，日益緊密，且願對該國軍事經濟文化等方面，予以更進一步之努力，並鑒於該國國民多年之宿願，用特表明爲該國之發展，決定傾力相助，又關於緬甸者，本年三月我政府會邀巴莫長官來日，傳達帝國之決意，因得明瞭巴莫長官及其以下各指導者，，關於緬甸獨立及協力大東亞戰爭之眞誠決意，且已於五月八日組成緬甸獨立準備委員會，積極進行獨立之一切準備，此實深可慶幸者，余深望其不日完成準備俾歷史的光榮之日從速到來再次關於菲島者，則菲島長官伐爾加斯等以下首腦，均欲爲重建菲島與協力，完遂大東亞戰爭，而挺身努力，一般民衆，亦已遂漸瞭解帝國眞意，積極協力。帝國對菲島獨立所具之態度，已於政府歷次聲明中，詳細表明但帝國於此決更進一步，在本年中予菲島以獲得獨立之榮譽特於此昭吿中外，抑菲島民衆前於美國之支配下，曾空有獨立之幻影，然自大東亞戰爭勃發後，未及二載，即已得償此多年之宿望，余想及菲島民衆之感激，實深堪爲菲島前途及大東亞之將來慶賀。再者馬來蘇門答臘爪哇婆羅洲，西里伯等地住民，在皇軍軍政下認眞之協力，已日益增大，即在戰爭之下，彼等亦已依照當地皇軍之善意指導，得使其自過去精神之壓迫中，獲得解放，現且已得敎育及其他各項文化之恩惠，度其充滿希望之生活，此爲印度纳西亞民衆諴深可欣快者。帝國於此願更進而根據原住民之希望，分別適應民情，在本年中逐漸實施關於原住民參與政治之措置其中對於爪哇，因鑒於其民衆之水準，決盡可能使其實現以應民衆之望。關於越南則越南當局於複雜之情勢下，處置頗爲得宜，帝國根據共同防衛之日法議定書精神，與越南謀加緊提携。如上所述，使萬邦各得共所，兆民各安其生，實已使我國肇國之大理想，在大東亞天地中，着着實現。多年來困於英美無厭搾取下之東亞民族，現已獲得光輝之黎明，在此大東亞各國家各民族蓬勃發展之中，惟有印度尚於英國之殘酷彈壓下，爲完成獨立，而大受痛苦。余對此衷心深爲同情，同時尤極感慷慨，帝國爲將印度民衆之敵人英美勢力逐出印度同，完成印度之獨立，實具有儘量採用一切手段之堅固決意。故吾人確信印度民衆之澎湃熱望，必可實現，英美之勢力，必被驅逐，余深信印度自由與繁榮之日之到來，已不在遠，且尤深望此日之早日到來。茲再一觀歐洲形勢，則德義等盟邦各國現與帝國之團結，巳日益鞏固，共同邁進於最後之勝利。余對於德義盟邦，各國在其已築成之必勝地位及其不動之指導力下遂行之雄偉戰爭，確信其必能成功。帝國今後亦誓於緊密之連繫援助下，共同澈底擊滅英美。現英美爲其目的，乃不擇手段，到處擾亂和平，擴大禍亂，竭力企圖將各中立國牽入戰渦。英美誘引他國與其共同作戰後，自身即欲避免直接遭受慘禍，僅令他國供其犧牲，如一旦戰而獲勝利，則以視之如蔽屣，棄而不顧，其所作之宣言條約等，即皆視爲廢紙，槪予抹殺，昔日所謂爲弱小國家着想而擁護其獨立者，今則於反手之間，已變而爲大國着想，而倡其專制之支配，其間毫無信義，僅知犧牲他國以圖自國之安逸，實可謂恬不知恥對於此種暴虐，實爲神人所共棄。又吾人對於不爲英美陰謀所動，而仍堅持中立之各國，於此謹表示　意。且日本現與此等各中立國仍保持極友好之關係　，更臻親密，目今內外懷勢實至重大，在此重大情勢之下，日本一億國民，正各就本位重新戰意，以戰塲將士之心爲心，舉其全力，重新宣誓，向完遂戰爭之途突進。政府當此重大之秋，決挺身立於一億國民之最前綫，以期使此更新之誓言，必趨於實踐之途。政府爲期以作戰必勝，建設必成之確信，以完遂大東亞戰爭起見，對於不論國內國外任何妨害，任何障碍，決斷然突破，並克服之，國內生產之現况，深幸由於國民諸君之熱意及努力，去年底起，已有顯著之改善及增强，但政府於此，仍以官民一致，以增强決戰態勢，並舉國一致，集中全力，以謀戰力之增强，政府奏請召開本屆臨時議會，提出關於整備企業糧食緊急增產等豫算案，並法律案之目的實亦爲依據以上之旨趣，而出此者。此次整備之企業決戰下，爲謀直接戰力之能更急速增强起見，故擴充過去整備企業之旨趣，而於產業之各部門間，實施澈底之整備，俾使全體國民，對於增强戰力，皆可有所貢獻。且政府因此爲謀迅速果斷之運營行政，同時對於與遂行戰爭無直接關係之企業，悉予以中止，或廢止，俾官民共同舉其全力，從事生產，以期向勝利之途邁進。</p>

<p>— 周佛海</p>
<p>轉載古今半月刋第廿五期</p>
<p>北平，我一共到了四次。但是每次多只勾留兩星期，少則只有六七天，所以對於北平的觀察和認識，實在談不上。這篇所記的，不過是每次北遊所生的一些雜感罷了。</p>
<p>第一次到北平。是在民國十七年北伐告成的時候，我在「盛袁閱盡話滄桑」一文中，已經說過了。當時意氣之盛，興致之豪，希望之大，眞是不可一世，在碧雲寺祭靈，報吿北伐完成之後，便在外交大樓開了一次極盛大的晚餐會。四個集團的主要幹部，全部出席，四位總司令都很高興的致詞，這個盛况，猶歷歷在目。三年前第三次，和今年第四次赴北平的時候，華北政務委員會的朋友，也都在外交大樓歡宴我，閉目瞑想，恍如置身當年盛會之中。但是物換星移，人事全非，眞令人發生萬分凄凉酸辛的滋味！</p>
<p>我們初到的時，住在碧雲寺傍的離宮。我和力子·布雷·立夫四人同住一房。我們都是愛玩的，到晚上便偷偷摸摸的進城去開旅館，自然有當地的朋友爲我們佈置一切。力子·布雷·有牌癮，叫幾個條子在旅館打牌，便可滿足。我和立夫，既不會打牌，而又年靑好動，所以便挨家挨戶的去打遊擊式的茶圍。到了天明，四人又偷倫摸摸出城囘到碧雲寺。後來蔣先生也搬進了城，我們越發方便了，因爲那時我們都是幕僚，稍有浪漫行爲，不怕別人指摘，別人也不會指摘。北平的茶圍打夠了，便和立夫兩人，請了兩天假到天津。因爲怕常地黨部的人知道、請去講演，所以秘密。下了旅館之後、兩人便出去，叫了兩部人力車，說要去打茶園。人力車夫把我們拉到　下等的地方，臭氣逼人，呌我們啼笑皆非。好容易找到了路數，又被省黨部的同志知道了，結果仍被拉去講演一次。黨部同志，要送我們上車，我便和立夫密議，讓他們送我們到地二個車站下車，仍乘北平來的火車，再去天津。但是因爲假期已滿，終未實行。不過當時興致之高，可以想見。「英雄老去覇圖空」，當年豪興、現在已消失殆盡。因此，也覺得生氣暫减了。</p>
<p>第一次到北京、常然要遊故宮。那一次同遊的人太多，除我們四人外，李宗仁，白崇禧，張治中，劉鎭華等等都在一起。雜在大隊人馬中，不能由個人的希望，細細的觀覽，不過走馬看花而已。</p>
<p>到了三大殿，沒有人不認爲偉大莊嚴的。我當時便覺得這是古代統治人民的一個方法。一個人統治許多人，一定要把這個人弄得富有神秘的意味和色彩，換句話說，要弄得神化。因爲大家都是人，爲甚麼一個人下命令，許多人要服從，有些人可管人，有些人要被管。在近代法律觀念發達之前，一定要把這些統治關係，弄得很神秘，而要神秘，却要靠環境的佈置，而且無論如何偉大的人物，在常常和他接近的人看起來，一定不覺得甚麼偉大。秦始皇也好，成吉思汗也好，拿破崙也好，任何偉大人物，他們的近侍，尤其是他們的太太，對於他們的敬佩，遠不及和他們不接近的人們對於他們的崇拜。所以如果不把他們的環境，佈置得莊嚴而神秘，使一般人覺得他們偉大，覺得他們神聖不可侵犯，統治的關係，就要發生動搖。從午門進去，要你走得氣喘，纔到正殿，就是先要你發生帝王如在天上之感，使你覺得對他俯首聽命是應該的。這不僅當時的朝廷，就是一個如縣衖門，從大門到大堂，也是這樣相當的距離。這些道理，當時都經過許多研究的。可惜入民國以後，這些神秘的辦法，一掃無遺。我說這話，一定有人罵我是官僚心理，是封建思想，其實不然，無論如何民主，體制和儀式，總是不可缺的，美國可算是民主國了，但是他們的大總統出去，一定前後簇擁着發出怪聲的警車。沒有到過美國的人，在電影新聞中也一定看過。這和中國以前的鳴鑼開道有甚麼不同？這和我們以前官吏出門，前面打着「肅靜」「迥避」的高脚牌有甚麼兩樣？至於斯達林居處和行動的嚴肅神秘，則不必說。所以把統治者弄得神秘一點，把他的起居坐臥之處弄得莊嚴一點，在政治上，恐怕不是完全沒洧必要。看着莊嚴偉大的殿闕，不由自主的這樣暗想。我當時又覺得沒有早生幾十年，沒有試過「上朝」的昧道，認爲遺憾。我開筆學作文章的那年，便廢了科舉，我沒有嘗過科學的滋味常認爲遺憾，當時看了廊廟之盛，又加了一個遺憾，但是如果恹復帝制，呌我到正大光明殿去上朝，是不是可以過癮？這也不行。因爲神秘的外衣，曾經一度脫去，再來穿上，已經不是原狀了，紙老虎已經戳穿，再糊上還有甚麽味道？這便是常年遊各殿時所發生的無聊的雜感。</p>
<p>遊到宮中，又是一種感想了。我立即想到當年妃嬗之盛，宮娥之美。所以對於妃嬪的遺蹟和傳說，特別感覺興趣。想着過去風流旖旎的事，不禁神往。李後主辭廟的時候，不揮淚對列祖列宗，而揮淚對宮娥。我遊到宮中，便立即想到當年宮娥的往事，我想：假使我是封建時代的帝王，無人管束，不怕攻擊，好點說，一定是個風流天子，壞點說，恐怕也是一個亡國之君！</p>
<p>第一次遊數百年的政治中心，其他歷史上，政治上的各種感想，當然還很多，乾燥無味，在這裏沒有寫出來的必要。</p>
<p>第二次便是民國十九年。這次便沒有第一次那樣興致了。因爲這時已經過了武漢討桂之役，和豫西討馮之役。第一集團軍和第二第四兩集團軍火併過了。第三集團軍領袖閻錫山，以退爲進，聲言陪馮出洋。我們此次到北平，便是要留閻。在這種情形之下，還有甚麼興致？這對政治情形且不去說、此次力子和立夫沒有隨行，只有布雷和我兩人。布雷是好靜的。我一個人要玩，那裏玩得起來？所以這次雖也到過韓家潭，百順胡同之類的地方，但是都不過是應酬交際而已。酒綠燈紅之餘，歌　人散之後，深覺世事日非，滿途荊棘。</p>
<p>這次到平的一個感想，就是覺得官僚勢力的偉大。所謂官僚，是指事務官而言：第一次來平時，舊政府所遺留下的官僚很多，且都徬徨無所之。這次來平，這些先生們在北平的却非常减少，都到南京參加國民政府，而且有許多很得意了。當時南京有句話，說是「軍事北伐，政治南征」。意思說，國民革命軍雖然奠定了幽燕，而北平官僚，却帶着腐敗的空氣，南征到新都。我想這是必然的，因爲事務官乃是一個政府構成的基本要素，任憑你有怎樣賢明的政治領補，任憑你有怎樣適合時代需要的政策政綱，沒有很好的事務官去執行，一切都是空想，都是具文。革命黨，老實說，是草澤英雄多，中間雖然也有許多留學生，但是大概都是只能談理論，而沒有行政技術的經騐和訓練，能夠做很好的政務官的同志，倒也不少，而能做很好的事務官的，確實不多。在這種情形之下，舊政府遺留下的事務官，當然要得　起來。當時國民黨許多靑年同志，對於這個現象，非常牢騷，以爲自已拚着命打出來的天下，却讓這些先生們來享現成福。其實不然，蘇俄共產革命之後，帝俄時代的技術家，專門家，不僅仍被任用，而且較爲優待。這是事實必然的。誰叫我們革命黨同志，只知好高驚遠，空談理論，而不切實的去受行政技術的訓練呢？</p>
<p>第二次赴平的主要目的，聯閻，排馮沒有達到、不到一逼，便即返京。閻接着發出禮讓爲國的通電、邀蔣出洋。中原大戰，於是　發。</p>
<p>第三次到北平，是民國二十九年，國民政府還都以後不久的時候。這時城廓依舊、人事全非。關於時代的感想，怎樣深刻，怎樣沉痛，不必去說，現在只說一說關於我個人的雜感罷。</p>
<p>下了飛機以後，由西直門進城，便覧德路絕行人。經過電車的交點，看見十餘輛電車，　　長蛇一般停着不動。心中大覺奇怪，詢問歡迎的人，纔知道照預定時間起斷絕交通，而我的專機慢了半小時，所以街市上已斷絕了許久交通，以致電車停下這樣多。爲我一個人，仲北平市民，感覺這樣的不方便，當時又是慚愧又是抱歉，又是不安。以後每次出門，所經路綫，還是斷絕交通。商懇再四，好容易第三天纔停止了。但是車前車後，不單是兩部電氣驟子，前呼後擁，而且跟着一大卡車的武裝衛士。地方當局，因爲責任關係，無論如何商求，這些決不肯解除。前面曾經說過，一個負責的人，要使他神秘，纔能使人敬畏，這是就一般而論的，如把這樣的辦法，加諸我的身上，那眞要我的命。多跟幾個衛士，己使我坐立不安，何况其他。但是在三十多年以前，就是王公大臣出門，也不見得完全斷絕交通。我以一個窮學生，竟在數百年帝王之都，出入斷絕交通起來，下意識也不禁引以自豪，然而不是在三十多年以前這樣，不是在中國統一的時候這樣，實覺美中不足。</p>
<p>這次住在中南海內的勤政殿，對面就是德宗被幽禁的瀛台。晚上睡在殿中，想起戊戌政變，想起兩宮失和，想起德宗在瀛台過的悲慘生活，想起宮廷中的許多秘密情形，思潮起伏，輾韓不能入夢。忽然奇想如果在三十多年以前，我能夠在這個地方起居坐臥，不知道是怎樣的情形。這個地方，現在雖然也不是普遍人所能隨便住的，但終覺得　在三十多年以前來住，味道要好得多</p>
<p>第四次遊北平，便是今年的四月。因爲老早拜託華北政務委員會的朋友，不要隆重招待，所以沒有斷絕交通，但是車子前後的兩匹電氣騾子，還是前呼後擁着，住的地方，仍是勤政殿。好在汪翊唐爲我在六國飯店開了幾個房間，白天在勤政殿見客。晚上便到六國飯店睡覺。我是歡喜旅館生活的，住在這裏，比住在空空洞洞，大而無當的勤政殿要舒適得多。</p>
<p>六國飯店在東交民巷，我還是第一次住。住在這裏，立即就想起拳匪圍攻這裏的情形，我想起八國聯軍入京的情形。當年的首都、雖然曾經英法聯軍佔領過一次，致文宗不能不蒙　熱河，然而中國的元氣，究竟還沒有大傷。庚子之役，竟使中國一蹶不能復振了。到了這個傷心的地方，想起傷心的往事，倍覺傷心。但是一想到靑天白日滿地紅的國旗，現在竟能飛揚於這個區城，立即便轉悲爲喜，深覺事在人爲，流一滴血、必可收一滴汗的效果而增强我奮鬥的決心。</p>
<p>偕淑慧赴碧雲寺，拜謁總理的衣冠塚，又遊了玉泉山·頤和園，正值百花盛開的時候，很助我們遊興，這些地方，都是舊地重遊，沒有甚麽特別感想。忽然想起來平數次，沒有到過景山。這個歷史上的傷心之地，一定要去，尤其是思宗殉國之處，要去憑吊一番。</p>
<p>站在景山的最高處，可以看見宮殿的全貌，可以看見北海和中南海，甚至於可以看見全城。我非常歡喜這個地方，盤棋了很久，纔慢慢下山，經過明思宗殉國處，撫摩古樹，不禁愴然。思宗雖是憫亡國之君，然而能夠殉國，不願意作靑衣侑酒的醜態，數百年後，猶令人起敬。「朕非亡國之君，諸臣乃亡國之臣」。在這句沉痛而簡單的言詞中，可見得他也是一個想有所作爲的帝王，可惜輔弼無人，弄得這樣悲慘的結果　憑弔古人，吁衡現勢，眞令人不寒而慄！</p>
<p>華北的糧食問題，非常嚴重。聽說北平每日有　百多人餓死，聞之悽惻，言之痛心。我常想自已沒有甚　特別享受，不過是日食三餐，夜眠一榻，現在想起來已經是得天獨厚了，日有三餐可食，用不着去吃草根樹葉；夜有一榻可眠，用不着去睡水門汀，這不是特別享受是甚麽？在特別享受之中，萬萬不可忘記民間疾苦，固然，環境有困難，能力有限制，究竟實際上能爲人民解除多少痛苦，謀得多少福利，乃是一個問題，但是心總不能不盡。盡了心，而力不能　，還不至於內疚神明，外慚民衆，如果連想都不想，那眞全無靈魂，全無心肝。我以此自警，以此自勉！</p>
<p>到北平四次，每次的時局都不同。第一次在北伐吿成的時候，最爲高興。第二次在內戰開始的時候，興致索然。第三次在國民政府還都以後，又悲又喜。第四次　對英美宣戰以後，對前途懷着無限的期待。每次有不同的時代背景，每次有不同的悲歡情緒。我希望第五次到北平的時候，內則完成統一，外則奠定和平總理遺囑中所，求的中國之自由平等，也完全實現，我們到碧雲寺，總理衣冠塚　，再舉行一次盛大的祭靈式！</p>

<h3 id="c22">第五屆助學運動的展開　請本報讀者一致熱烈贊助 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>本報倡導助學運動，於今爲第五屆，以過去四屆而論，承社會熱忱贊助，殷切屬望，使我們一切事工，得免隕越，失學靑年，獲遂向學之願，這是首先應向各界敬致衷誠之感謝的。茲值第五屆助學運動發軔之始，我們自身感於使命之重大，滿懷着無限熱望，敢攄私臆，一陳於社會熱心人士之前。</p>
<p>我們認爲助學運動具有一種崇髙的境界，而其意義的深長，尤非一般救濟工作可比。蓋助學的最大目的，是爲社會散播智識種子，爲下一代培養健全有爲的國民，在目前，或者不能看到什麽，但其將來的成果，是非常之偉大的。譬之植樹，當種苗時，誠卑不足道，逮若干年後，靑葱蓬勃，干雲直上，不可遏止，方知辛苦培壅之不爲徒勞。古人本有「十年樹木，百年樹人」之說，「樹人」尤其是社會上一種積極性的建設，故具有崇高的境界。其次，我國從來不以助學爲善舉，確認定是同情心和責任心的併發，在助學者不以憐憫和施捨爲出發點；而被助者却保持着自尊和奮發有爲的心情。其所報答於助學者，惟求此種同情心和責任心的發揚光大，惟求獲得自助後將來更舉以助人，務使助學運動，蔚爲風尚，普遍及於各個地方以及各個階層。果能如此，是助學之最高理想，已經達成，所以我們說，助學運動意義的深長，非一般救濟工作可比。</p>
<p>本屆助學運動展開後，最令我們惴惴的，是下學期各校學費將有普遍的增加，增加數目，在目前尚無從得知，但影響所及，必有無數父兄，因不勝負擔而令子弟失學的。同時，也是必然的現象，失學靑年所希冀於助學者，其數量亦必較上屆激增。就本報過去助學統計，第一屆核准獲助者爲一千零五人，助金三三，七三　，六〇元，第二屆九百八十四人，助金五一，五八七，五〇元，第三屆一千二百二十三人，助金一五六，四二二，五〇元，第四屆一千六百九十四人，助金二四六，〇一六，〇〇元。每屆核准人數和助金數額，均進展甚速，本屆因各校學費的增加和失學靑年喁喁的期待，我們所需要的助金數額，或更爲一龐大的數字。</p>
<p>因此，我們懇切地向社會人士籲請一致起來贊助本屆助學運動，在過去，各界所給予我們的協力，是十分熱烈而令人感動的。我們從未以任何方法直接向外界勸募，僅憑一點至誠和大公無私的態度，向讀者申述失學靑年對國家社會的損失，希望大家共同肩負這個助學的責任。果然，每次所獲到的助金，都適合我們需要而有餘，並且，我們也從未計及下屆助金的如何籌措，凡敦品勵行努力讀書之失學靑年，一經考　合格，必儘量予以協助，故每屆助金結束之際，必所存無幾，而下屆所得之捐軟，尤視上屆爲踴躍。我們相信讀者在精神上，和我們聯繫在一起，對於助學工作，隨時予我們以監督和維護，對於本屆助學，一定給予更大的同情與更大的佽助的。</p>
<p>由於學費的增加，　會推想到敎師的淸苦。在此動盪時代中，生活高壓，使每個人都透不過氣來，而勞心者處境之痛苦，殆尤視勞力者爲甚。我們決不忍責令敎師枵腹授課而置其一家衣食於不顧，故學校增加學費，改善敎師待遇，是大家一致予以同情的。不過眼前有一最嚴重的問題，是「一敎師改行」和「課本販子」，我們知道有許多專門敎師以講授所入，不能維持其最低生活，於是辭去職務，改營別業，果可衣食充裕，各展所長，爲私人計，固屬良得，但爲學校師資着想，却是無可彌補的損失。要知一專家師資的養成，不知要化費國家幾許財力，今一旦他圖，在學校少一卓越導師，在學生則無由救濟其智識飢饉，這種損失，是莫可估計的。至於「課本販子」，則求兼課多，鐘點多，一日之間，僕僕道途，視講義爲販賣品，學生自難獲其實益，敎師亦彌感勞頓。上述兩種人物，似爲無可否認的事實。我們希望學校方面於此次增加學費後，澈底整頓敎師待遇問題，務求「改行」的敎師，仍歸本位，「兼課」的敎師，改爲專任，如是，對於整個的敎育前途，實獲益非淺。</p>
<p>至向木報申請獲助的學生，以四屆合併計算，其總數約爲五千人弱，所用去的助金，約五十萬元，這一點渺小的成就，我們也無庸否認。關於學生學業的考查，會隨時予以注意，最近復印發表格，請各人自動填繳，其目的蓋因助金旣取之於社會，學生學業之進展與否，自亦爲社會所共同關心之一事，故不得不嚴密覈詢，鄭重將事。我們所期望於獲助諸生者，在其自身之覺醒，認識時代，針對現實，毌忽視未來之責任，毋　過片刻之光陰，而求學之道，尤貴在去驕去惰，如是方能勇猛精進，成一全材，爲圃家效力。王船山先生曾言，學者以去驕去惰爲木識，如登高山，登一峯始見彼峯之矗立於上，遠望則最上之峯，早如在目，其實這最上之峯，尚高不可攀躋呢！可見得學問是無止境的，我們欲以此意作爲勗勉之贈詞。此外，尤望諸君於讀書而外，應求教品勵行，在修養上下一番刻苦功夫。</p>
<p>最後，請愛護本報的讀者，共同担負了這個助學責任，節省不必需要費用，捐輸給這一件有意義的事工，我們應該視這般失學的靑年，和我們自己的子弟一樣，大家踴躍輸將，使助學範圍，較上屆更爲廣泛，使失學靑年都有讀書的機會。</p>

<h3 id="c30">刊行大藏經 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>大藏經爲佛學巨者。吾國歷代皆有編印藏經之舉，民國以來，因政治環境之變遷莫定，以及此種巨著編印之不易，迄無人能計議及此。近普慧居士盛幼盫先生大發宏願，擬刋行大藏經，昨已商議辦法，組織刊行會，並先籌撥事務費用，着手進行。我人對此佛敎上，學術上，文化上空前盛事，不勝馨香禱祝其前途順利，卒底於成。</p>
<p>按此次擬刊行之大藏經內容，將爲匯集南傳與北傳之經論，總攝如來一代時敎，而南傳尤爲歷代編印中所缺者，更可珍視。此外，更補人各藏未載之其他重要著作，並校正與考訂前代印木之遺誤與翻譯名義之異同。凡此種種，對於學術文化上之貢獻，尤足多者。</p>
<p>惟是我人對此艱鉅工作，自然衷心期待其早覜厥成，可是，正因爲太艱太鉅，就非行之以毅，持之以恒，很容易流於半途而廢。我們不但誠懇的盼望普慧居士愼始克終，主持其事，爲佛敎文化史上留一不朽之頁，同時也盼望協皆其事者以同樣的意志爲此努力到底，則經過若干時後，我們必能與此新大藏經相見。</p>
<p>葉恭綽先生，學問淵博，對於藏經，尤研求有素，所表示之意見平穩篤實，自足供刊行會當局的重視與參考。又刊行會設於靜安寺，該寺爲本市名古刹，名寺名經，相得益彰。</p>

<p>我國自宋代以後，歷朝均有佛敎大藏經之刊行，民國肇建迄今，政府及社會，均尚未有議及斯舉。最近盛幼盫氏發起編印普慧大藏經（按普慧乃盛氏之法名），除先助事務費五十萬元外，並積極籌畫進行，昨邀集佛敎學者名流在靜安寺會議，到有輿慈·持松·芝峯·李思浩·陶希泉·蔣竹莊·丁福保·吳蘊齋·陳彬龢等，決定編印計畫，除搜集補入歷代大藏未載之重要著作外，並將翻譯南傳大藏經全部併入，蓋以南傳藏經，係阿育王時代傳入南天竺，從未傳入中土，今尚爲首次之着手翻譯，此項計畫完成，將爲南傳北傳佛敎經籍之總匯合，實爲佛敎文化史上之剙舉。葉恭綽氏昨致函陶希泉詳述意見，原函錄載於后：</p>
<p>葉恭綽氏編印意見歸滬尙晤，良切依馳，弟杜門養疴，迄未詣人，尤怯酬應，因腸胃積弱，出外一飲食，便困頓數日，極以爲苦也，十六日承公與幼盫兄召宴，亟擬晤談，且聞幼盫兄　詢及下走，意甚殷摯，尤欲一見，惟以前情之故，且此數日，適有小感冒，未敢外出，歉謝之至，微聞靜安之會，係商普懇大藏進行之事，此乃民國三十年來第一盛舉，聞之忭舞，弟對歷代藏經，研求有素，私恒謂宋元明淸遼金開國，無不有編印佛藏之舉，民國獨無人提及，實爲國家之恥，曾與戴李　王一亭言之，極以爲然，久未　及也。宋之黃福思溪萬壽磧砂，明之經山五種大藏，皆非假國力，幼翁此舉，足繼前賢，惟當此環境劇變之時，欲此事之克底於成，非先有縝密之計畫不可，否則極易半途而廢，轉事羣望，並違初願。竊意此事第一應先定編纂大綱，第二根據大綱，定出預算，今日編印大藏，如蹈襲前此各藏之舊，則無須多此一舉。聞有人主張將大正藏加以校勘，此爲費力不討好之舉，蓋其所據五種藏我尚無其底本（麗藏即決不能得），何况能另有根據，以糾其疏誤耶。鄙意今日民國編藏，有至要之點，即蒐采國內各藏以前之遺佚是也。按各藏之遺佚，不外數因，一因帝正宰官或僧侶懷挾政治宗敎上之私見，不許其入藏者。二因帝王宰官懷挾政洽宗敎上之私見而撤之出藏者。三單行孤水未傳世行遠　未入藏者。四遠土後　中國未及　見者。五雍正以後支那撰述本來不入藏者。此五者，雖不能　舉其名與數，然可信爲數不少，且必有非常價值，而且適爲今日所應爲所可爲之事。蓋今日文化棣通、易於采訪，政治上之忌諱痼蔽悉已滌除，以前各種障碍，可云無有，如不及時從事，實屬負此時代。今日編藏，必應以此爲主要目的及中心要點，其餘再加以何項，亦無不可，統視時間財力爲進行程序可耳。惟今日生活程度日高，物價尤漲進不已，如不先有慨算，必致進退維谷。竊意印行雖係以後之事，而目下必須預有計畫，猶之建屋，須視地盤及成水也，今日刻木板已無庸議（因價太昂工太緩）排印與石印則大有斟酌之餘地，最好係用分批出書之法，全藏礕如以一百大册爲準，假定分五批或十批，如十批則每批十册，的計采訪購置編譯鈔校印行各費，至少須五十萬元（始以二百部計算），即每十册成本爲二千五百元，每一册成本爲二百五十元，印成出售，恐難夠本。假令得囘一半爲二十五萬元，則須再出二十五萬元，如此循環，期以十年，竣事不能謂之急促，如覺得此數太鉅，期太遠，則以五十大册爲準，或可减去經費之半，則內容亦須隨之變易，如此大事，決不可草率下手，致貽虎頭蛇尾之譏，致對不住幼翁也。至采訪遺佚，固貴愼擇，然萬不可有門戶派別之見，應一矯往者積弊，方能去粗得精汰偽存眞，並宜注重各宗著述之隱晦散亡者，庶佛學之菁英，經此闡露於世，其功德實不可思議。病中偶有所見，輒以貢諸左右，冀裨高深，其餘細目，當俟後來者酌，不亟亟也。專佈。</p>

<p>經濟界　小言論　銀行增資與合併問題</p>
<p>日前報載銀行資本，至少須達三百萬元，而最近幾個月來各新設銀行已實行紛紛增資了。這完全出於銀行的自動，乃各銀行的預防政策，政府果然頒下這項命令，亦不致臨時張皇。事實上現在一二白萬元的資本，確是難於經營，所以銀行爲着增厚實力，便於調度起見，乃有增資擴充之舉。</p>
<p>因爲銀行有增資的傾向，於是有資本較小的銀行須加合併的傳說。合併一事，外國早有先例，我國亦未嘗沒有，但亦並不是一件很簡單的事。茲略述增資合併二事所想到的幾點：</p>
<p>（一）政府果有調整銀行的計劃，必有切實的辦法，予銀行以適當期間俾得從事增資或合併，決不會突然一紙命令，徒使銀行張皇失措。所以銀行母庸過於憂慮。但是照趨勢來看，銀行也應未雨綢繆，早爲之計。</p>
<p>（二）若果較小的銀行必須合併，政府亦不過處於指導督促的地位，仍須由銀行自行計劃，妥善進行。因爲各銀行有各銀行的背景，歷史與現况的不同，此外，人事問題，最費周章，並非可以一最即合。所以合併一事，並不如普通所聽所說的便當。</p>
<p>（三）合併有各種不同的方式與程度，第一完全合併，即二家或二家以上的銀行完全併爲一個組織。第二集中管理，即以一管理公司掌握二家或二家以上的股份，第三連鎖瞥理，即以一人或數人執有數行的股份，兼任數行的董事，以便獲得業務上的連絡與合作。現在合於第三種情形的，已數見不鮮，更進一步的聯繫，或許也可辦到。所以合併一事，也得酌量情形辦理，其中頗有伸縮的餘地。</p>
<p>（四）講到銀行實際的信譽和財力，實在不能專就資本來判定，不過資是易於比較的一個指標罷了。舊銀行過去資本在四五百萬元的不多，新銀行四五百萬元的資本，反習以爲常。所以新舊銀行，不能同樣來判斷。舊銀行果眞資產雄厚，即使爲符合法令，升股增資，自亦不成問題。</p>
<p>（五）新銀行增資的，現在已經不少，其中也難免爲流動資金的缺乏而增資的。若果如此，則銀行過去的營業方針，亦必錯誤。新增的資金，即不可再用於呆滯興不正當的途徑。市面銀根，或許不至過份再緊，但在最近將來，亦不至十分轉鬆。保持資金流動的地位，是經營商業銀行的最要原則，這是銀行所應特別注意的。</p>
<p>總之，政府方面，在整飭金融的方針下，自當體卹商艱，妥善措置。但銀行方面，尤應嚴加自肅，力事充厚，走向最穩妥的途徑上去。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Opening of the Japanese Extraordinary Diet Session <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Japanese Diet officially commenced on the 15th of this month. The session is scheduled to last for three days, from the 16th to the 18th. According to brief reports, the government is expected to present eight proposed laws and three budget proposals. In addition, reports regarding the various aspects of the Greater East Asia War situation from both the Army and Navy are expected. With the session still ongoing, it would be presumptuous to speculate or criticize. However, considering the current situation in East Asia, the convening of this Japanese Extraordinary Diet Session is of utmost importance. We, the people of our nation, who are moving toward the path of completing the Greater East Asia War, should have the most accurate understanding.</p>
<p>The current international situation is quite clear. Both in East Asia and Europe, we are facing the eve of a decisive battle. Both the enemy and our side are strengthening their preparation activities in political, military, and diplomatic aspects, as well as in the economies of their own countries and their allies, in order to prepare for the decisive battle. In Europe, the fierce air battles in the Mediterranean and the increasingly tense situation on the German-Soviet front, as well as the movements of the neutral countries at both ends of the Mediterranean, are drawing the world's attention. However, we can say that all these developments in Europe and the problems arising from them, such as the direction of the neutral countries, the Axis powers' strategies and the strength of their two-front war capabilities, and even the actual trend of the Anglo-American plans to open a "second front," all have a focus that is at least half tied to the situation in East Asia. To get the correct answers to all of the above questions, everyone must look at the situation in East Asia. Despite the Anglo-American rhetoric about "opening a second front" and "landing operations in Europe," they have to allocate the greatest force to consider "Japan's next move." They have to allocate the majority of their troops to reinforce India, and they have to allocate a considerable portion of their naval and air forces to the remote areas of northwestern Australia. They not only lament the strategic weakness of the Chongqing regime but also have to put the largest portion of the entire U.S. military force, even the full strength of the Navy, in the Pacific! In this way, the significant impact of everything Japan does today on the European and even the global war situation is quite evident.</p>
<p>The movements in East Asia will determine the movements in Europe! Today, Japan is shouldering the mission of being the determiner of future history!</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War a year and a half ago, thanks to the loyal and brave combat of the officers and soldiers of the Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force, and also thanks to the awareness and cooperation of the oppressed peoples of East Asia for the anti-Anglo-American war, we have already achieved unprecedented great war results in history. In military and political aspects, we have gradually formed a system that is certain to win. At the same time, we are actively advancing the foundational work of the Greater East Asia construction. At this time of facing a decisive battle, the convening of the 82nd Japanese Diet session and the reports of Prime Minister Tojo and the Army and Navy ministers will not only be valued by the Japanese subjects and the East Asian nations but also be observed with interest by the neutral countries, the Axis countries in Europe, and even the enemy countries of Britain and America. At the same time, the resolutions of the three supplementary budget proposals and the eight government-proposed bills will have a significant impact on the future of East Asia and the global war situation.</p>
<p>According to the announcement by the Japanese Information Bureau on the 14th of this month, the supplementary budget for the general accounting and special accounting of the Showa 18th year (1943) has reached 620 million yen in both revenue and expenditure. The total budget has exceeded 13.8 billion yen (13.895 billion yen), and the deficit bonds in the financial resources are only 313.22 million yen. Including the additional issuance of railway bonds, the total amount of bonds issued this year is over 21.86 billion yen. This huge budget of Japan fully demonstrates the characteristics of a "decisive battle budget." Because looking at the content of the supplementary budget, (A) General Accounting: Ministry of Home Affairs 4 million yen, Ministry of Finance 3 million yen, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry 491 million yen, Ministry of Commerce and Industry 63 million yen, Ministry of Health and Welfare 57 million yen, totaling 620 million yen; (B) Special Accounting: Korean Government-General 140 million yen, Korean Food Management 368 million yen, Taiwan Government-General 43 million yen, Taiwan Rice Export Management 16 million yen, National Debt Consolidation Fund 420 million yen, Public Debt Fund 440 million yen, Imperial Railway 2 million yen. (The figures below one million yen are not included, according to the Tokyo dispatch from the Allied News Agency on the 14th of this month, Continental News on the 15th). Combining these items and figures, it can be said that it is entirely focused on increasing war power, consolidating enterprises, and thoroughly increasing food production expenses.</p>
<p>As for the government's side, the eight bills proposed by the government for construction have not been announced, but according to the Tokyo dispatch from the Allied News Agency on the 14th of this month, it has been clearly reported that their main purpose is to strengthen and enrich the national decisive battle system. Looking back since the 81st Diet session this spring, the authorities of our friendly nation of Japan have implemented a new policy toward China externally, strengthening the cooperation system of the three axis countries of China, Japan, and Manchukuo in East Asia, and furthermore, towards the southern countries, starting with Burma and the Philippines, forming a solid cooperation to carry out the Greater East Asia War and liberation cooperation; internally, they have strengthened the position of the Cabinet and strengthened the national unity system. Today, facing the major situation of the decisive battle, there is no doubt that the 82nd Diet will further carry out the spirit of the past, consolidate the unity of the 100 million Japanese citizens and the 1 billion East Asian peoples, and create a steel chain to defend East Asia in the decisive battle phase. We firmly believe that in this session of the Diet, the seamless integration of the Japanese government and the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and the unity of the Japanese government and the people will enable the Diet to express a strong force, and will also have better and more exciting revelations for the unity of China, Japan, and the East Asian nations.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that the 82nd Japanese Diet will achieve unprecedented results. What we hope is that at the beginning of this decisive battle phase, the government and the people of China can further unite and become a main force in the East Asian decisive battle, and more effectively cooperate with friendly nations and East Asian nations to overcome all difficulties and move towards final victory.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Prime Minister Tojo Delivers Policy Speech Articulating the Beliefs Held by the Japanese Government Resolves to Lead the Entire Nation in Striving for Final Victory and to Advance Hand in Hand with China Towards Common Goals <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) The 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Japanese Diet held its opening ceremony this morning. The House of Peers and the House of Representatives held plenary sessions at 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM respectively, during which Japanese Prime Minister Tojo delivered policy speeches in both houses, expounding to China and the outside world the beliefs of the Japanese government. He first described the current stage of the Greater East Asia War, publicly explaining the current state of Greater East Asia construction, the movements of various countries and nations within the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the overall picture of the new policies Japan has adopted in response. Finally, he expressed the Japanese government's determination to lead the entire nation in exerting all efforts to advance courageously on the path to completing the war. The gist of the Prime Minister's speech is recorded as follows: Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it has been exactly a year and a half. Our soldiers have occupied and secured vast areas under the Emperor's august authority, achieving glorious victories. I would like to take this opportunity to join you in expressing our heartfelt gratitude to the soldiers on the front lines for their tireless efforts and heroic fighting. However, many warriors have sacrificed their lives for the country to establish this glorious achievement, becoming guardian deities of the nation. In particular, the heroic death of Admiral Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, on the front lines in the South, and the tragic death of Commander Yamazaki and his soldiers on Attu Island are most inspiring to our nation. Every Japanese citizen, whenever they recall the tragic death of these many loyal and righteous soldiers, is determined to follow in the footsteps of the martyrs and continue to move forward. Our country has such warriors, and we have people who are willing to follow in the footsteps of the martyrs, so we will surely achieve final victory in the Greater East Asia War. While I cherish the achievements of Marshal Yamamoto and all the fallen soldiers and mourn them, I am even more determined to advance on the path to defeating Britain and America to console the souls of the martyrs in heaven. Now, under the Emperor's august authority, our country has established a strategically certain-to-win posture in various regions of Greater East Asia, and this posture is being strengthened day by day. The abundant resources of Greater East Asia are also being rapidly developed to strengthen our war power. Our country's establishment of this posture in East Asia will quickly seize the lifeline of Britain and America. Therefore, Britain and America are deeply shocked to see our country's rapid development in Greater East Asia. In order to stop us, they have used all the material forces they rely on and have exhausted all their plans by any means. They have repeatedly tried to counterattack, but they do not know that this has long been anticipated by our country. Our country has taken advantage of these counterattack opportunities of the enemy to defeat them anytime and anywhere, and has also taken measures to make the enemy surrender. Currently, our army has launched large-scale operations in China, on the Indian-Burmese border, and in the Pacific, and will inflict heavy damage on the enemy. Therefore, the war situation will become more and more important, and the battles will become more and more heroic. Therefore, this is the time for our 100 million citizens to face the national crisis together, with the belief of certain victory, and to display the traditional spirit of loyalty and valor of the people. In order to adapt to the above situation, you and I must clearly point out the deep-seated suffering of Britain and America. With the certainty of victory, we will resolutely exert all our efforts to win the final victory in the spiritual war until Britain and America surrender, so as to ease the Emperor's concerns. Currently, looking at the trends in Greater East Asia, the trust of various countries and nations in Japan and the sincere assistance they are automatically providing for the completion of the Greater East Asia War are increasing day by day. I recently visited the Republic of China, Manchukuo, and the Philippines, and personally witnessed the current situation in various places, and held frank talks with the authorities of various countries. This has made my conviction even stronger. Japan's unwavering policy is to liberate the entire Greater East Asia from the shackles of Britain and America forever and restore our original identity. Japan's policies have consistently been based on this established policy and have been moving forward to this day. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it has been a year and a half. Today, 1 billion people in Greater East Asia have understood Japan's true intentions and are convinced that if the Greater East Asia War is not completed, East Asia will not be liberated, and the new order in Greater East Asia will not be established, and the nations of Greater East Asia will have no happiness to speak of. This conviction is now growing stronger and stronger, which is truly worthy of celebration for Greater East Asia. In order to cope with the above situation and respond to the sincerity and assistance of various countries and nations, Japan believes that it is necessary to implement its policies at this time. Now, I would like to frankly inform you of the beliefs held by the government regarding the main points. Speaking of Manchukuo, that country and our country are friendly nations. His Majesty the Emperor has personally set an example, and the people of that country have unanimously assisted our country in both material and spiritual aspects and have contributed greatly. Our country has also assisted that country in making sound development. The friendship between Japan and Manchukuo is extremely close. Speaking of the Republic of China, officials and civilians throughout the country are all working in their respective positions under the leadership of President Wang. I am deeply grateful for the sincere attitude they have taken towards our country. Now, in the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration, they are joining hands with our country and advancing towards the completion of common goals. Our friendly nation, the Republic of China, has suffered from the invasion of Britain and America for hundreds of years and has experienced countless hardships. But now it has broken free from its shackles and is striving for self-reliance, and with the qualifications of a completely autonomous and independent nation, it is cooperating with our country and wants to fully exert its strength in the construction of Greater East Asia. This is because the long-cherished wish and dream of the Chinese people have been realized. Recently, generals such as Pang Bingxun, Sun Dianying, and Rong Ziheng, as well as many other people, have successively defected from the Chongqing side and supported President Wang. This has fully demonstrated the natural trend of China's revival. Our friendly nation, China, has achieved this kind of prosperity, which is worthy of celebration for the future of China, Greater East Asia, and the entire human race. At this time, our country, in addition to sincerely congratulating our friendly nation China on this rise, has also decided to double its support in the future, and plans to fundamentally revise the treaties concluded between China and Japan, so that the cooperative relationship between the two countries will be even closer. Secondly, regarding Thailand, that country has now cleared up the complex and delicate relationship with Britain and America for many years, and has resolutely joined hands with the Empire. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Pibulsonggram, it has overcome many obstacles and difficulties and has stood up and worked hard to complete the Greater East Asia War. I deeply respect this. The Empire also hopes that its cooperation with that country will become closer and closer in the future, and is willing to make further efforts in the military, economic, and cultural aspects of that country. In view of the long-cherished wish of the people of that country, it is specially stated that it has decided to devote its efforts to helping the development of that country. Also, regarding Burma, in March of this year, our government invited Chief Minister Ba Maw to Japan to convey the Empire's decision. As a result, we were able to understand the sincere determination of Chief Minister Ba Maw and other leaders regarding Burma's independence and cooperation in the Greater East Asia War, and on May 8th, the Burmese Independence Preparatory Committee was formed to actively carry out all preparations for independence. This is indeed deeply gratifying. I deeply hope that it will complete its preparations soon so that the glorious day of history will come soon. Again, regarding the Philippines, the leaders such as Governor Vargas of the Philippines are working hard to rebuild the Philippines and cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War, and the general public is also gradually understanding the Empire's true intentions and actively cooperating. The Empire's attitude towards the independence of the Philippines has been detailed in previous government statements, but the Empire has decided to go a step further and grant the Philippines the honor of gaining independence this year, and hereby announces this to China and the outside world. The Philippine people, who previously had only the illusion of independence under American rule, have now fulfilled this long-cherished wish less than two years after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. I think of the gratitude of the Philippine people and am truly happy for the future of the Philippines and the future of Greater East Asia. Furthermore, the residents of Malaya, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Celebes, and other places are cooperating seriously under the Imperial Army's military administration, and this cooperation is increasing day by day. Even under the war, they have been liberated from the mental oppression of the past under the Imperial Army's well-intentioned guidance, and now they have received education and other cultural benefits and are living a life full of hope. This is truly gratifying for the Indonesian people. The Empire hereby wishes to go further and, according to the wishes of the indigenous people, adapt to the local conditions and gradually implement measures for the indigenous people to participate in politics this year. Among them, for Java, in view of the level of its people, it has decided to make it as possible as to meet the wishes of the people. Regarding Vietnam, the Vietnamese authorities have handled the situation quite well under complex circumstances. The Empire, based on the spirit of the Franco-Japanese Agreement on Joint Defense, is seeking to strengthen its cooperation with Vietnam. As mentioned above, the great ideal of our nation's founding, which is to enable all nations to live in harmony and all people to live in peace, has been realized step by step in the Greater East Asia region. The East Asian nations, which have been suffering from the insatiable exploitation of Britain and America for many years, have now obtained the glorious dawn. In the midst of this vigorous development of various countries and nations in Greater East Asia, only India is still suffering under the cruel suppression of Britain in order to achieve independence. I deeply sympathize with this from the bottom of my heart, and I am especially moved with great emotion. The Empire has a firm determination to use all possible means to drive the enemies of the Indian people, the British and American forces, out of India and complete India's independence. Therefore, we are convinced that the surging aspirations of the Indian people will be realized, and the forces of Britain and America will be driven out. I firmly believe that the day of India's freedom and prosperity is not far away, and I especially hope that this day will come soon. Now, looking at the European situation again, the unity between the allied nations such as Germany and Italy and the Empire is becoming more and more solid, and they are advancing together towards final victory. I am convinced that the allied nations of Germany and Italy will succeed in their magnificent wars, which they are conducting under their established position of certain victory and their unwavering leadership. The Empire also vows to thoroughly destroy Britain and America together with close ties and assistance in the future. Now, Britain and America, for their own purposes, are using any means to disturb peace everywhere, expand disasters, and try their best to drag neutral countries into the vortex of war. After luring other countries to fight with them, Britain and America themselves want to avoid directly suffering the tragic consequences and only let other countries serve as their sacrifices. Once they win the war, they will regard them as worn-out shoes and abandon them. All the declarations and treaties they have made will be regarded as waste paper and will be wiped out. What they used to call thinking for the sake of small and weak countries and supporting their independence has now turned into thinking for the sake of big countries and advocating their autocratic rule. There is no integrity in between, and they only know how to sacrifice other countries to seek their own comfort. It can be said that they are shameless. For this kind of tyranny, gods and men alike will abandon them. Also, we hereby express our respect to those countries that have not been moved by the British and American conspiracies and still maintain their neutrality. Japan currently maintains extremely friendly relations with these neutral countries and is becoming even closer. The situation at home and abroad is very important at the moment. Under this important situation, 100 million Japanese citizens are re-energizing their fighting spirit in their respective positions, taking the hearts of the soldiers on the battlefield as their own hearts, exerting all their efforts, re-swearing, and advancing towards the completion of the war. At this critical moment, the government has decided to stand at the forefront of the 100 million citizens in order to ensure that this renewed vow will surely be put into practice. In order to ensure victory in the war and success in construction, and in order to complete the Greater East Asia War, the government will resolutely break through and overcome any hindrance or obstacle, whether domestic or foreign. Fortunately, thanks to the enthusiasm and efforts of the people, the current situation of domestic production has shown significant improvement and enhancement since the end of last year. However, the government is still working with the public to enhance the decisive battle posture, and is concentrating all its efforts as a nation to enhance its war power. The purpose of the government's request to convene this extraordinary session of the Diet and to submit the budget proposals and bills on consolidating enterprises and urgently increasing food production is based on the above intention. The purpose of this consolidation of enterprises under the decisive battle is to more rapidly enhance direct war power, so we are expanding the purpose of past enterprise consolidation and implementing thorough consolidation in various sectors of industry, so that all citizens can contribute to enhancing war power. In addition, in order to operate the administration quickly and decisively, the government will also suspend or abolish all enterprises that are not directly related to the prosecution of the war, so that the government and the people can jointly exert all their efforts to engage in production in order to move towards victory.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) The plenary session of the House of Peers of the Japanese Diet was held at 2:00 PM on the 16th, during which Prime Minister Tojo delivered a policy speech, followed by Minister of the Army Tojo, concurrently, and Minister of the Navy Shimada, who reported on the war situation of the Army and Navy since last December respectively. A resolution of thanks to the Army and Navy was passed, and the session was adjourned at 3:56 PM.</p>
<p>Tojo and Shimada Report on the War Situation of the Japanese Army and Navy</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) Minister of the Army Tojo, concurrently, reported on the war situation of the Army at both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives of the Japanese Diet, stating briefly: Regarding the Aleutian Islands, since the Japanese Army and Navy units launched a surprise attack on and occupied the Aleutian Islands last June, the enemy was greatly shocked, because at least, this allowed several divisions of enemy ground forces, 600-700 aircraft, and other powerful fleets of aircraft carriers and battleships to be contained in the eastern Aleutians. Moreover, the enemy gradually advanced its base westward, and in February, it established an airfield on Amchitka Island east of Kiska Island. It is currently guarded by the Army, and large aircraft can take off and land. The enemy has also dispatched aircraft and fleets to cut off the Japanese supply routes in an attempt to isolate the Japanese garrison in the western Aleutians. The Japanese garrison, on the one hand, has been subjected to daily air raids by enemy aircraft, and on the other hand, has been responsible for the defense of the isolated island in the open sea for a year. On May 12th of this year, the enemy took advantage of the dense fog to land on Attu Island from the north, south, and east, and Commander Yamazaki and his unit were completely annihilated. This unparalleled spirit of loyalty of the Japanese army is enough to amaze the world and chill the enemy's courage.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) Minister of the Navy Shimada reported in detail on the war situation of the Japanese Navy in (1) the Indian Ocean, (2) the North Pacific, and (3) the South Pacific at the 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Diet convened today. He strongly stated that the Japanese army should not hesitate to make sacrifices and should actively fight to achieve the final victory.</p>
<p>The Emperor Visits the Diet and Issues an Imperial Rescript on the Opening of the Session</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) The opening ceremony of the 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Japanese Diet was solemnly held on the 16th under the Emperor's presence. On that day, His Majesty the Emperor departed from the Imperial Palace at 10:40 AM and arrived at the plenary session hall of the House of Peers, where the opening ceremony was held at 11:00 AM. He bestowed a generous Imperial Rescript on the occasion, for which the members of both houses were deeply grateful. His Majesty the Emperor then departed from the Diet building at 11:15 AM and returned to the Imperial Palace.</p>

<p>Guangzhou, 16th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Zhou Fohai, Deputy President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance of the National Government, recently flew from the capital to this city. He met with reporters and delivered the following speech:</p>
<p>It has been seventeen years since I left Guangzhou in the fifteenth year of the Republic. Coming here, to the cradle of the revolution, I am filled with immense emotion. Our Founding Father, Mr. Sun, indicated to us that the purpose of the National Revolution was to seek freedom and equality for China, and to achieve this goal, it was necessary to abolish the unequal treaties. Since China declared war on England and the United States on January 9th of this year, the unequal treaties that England and the United States had previously imposed on our country have naturally been canceled. Furthermore, with our friendly nation Japan taking the lead in automatically declaring the abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of concessions, followed successively by Italy and other countries, the goal that the Founding Father had sought to achieve for more than forty years of revolution has thus been accomplished. At this time when the revolutionary goal has been achieved, returning to Guangzhou, the cradle of the revolution, my heartfelt joy and excitement cannot be described with words or writing. In recent years, due to the efforts of the provincial government authorities and the enthusiastic assistance from various quarters of friendly nations, Guangdong's construction has been steadily improving. The Chairman is extremely pleased, and my colleagues in the central government are extremely admiring. This time, I have returned and witnessed the flourishing atmosphere in all aspects, and I am even more excited and grateful for the painstaking efforts of the provincial government authorities and various quarters of friendly nations.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>According to news from Chongqing, Chongqing and the United States recently concluded a military tribunal agreement. The main content is that criminal cases committed by U.S. military personnel stationed in Chongqing will be tried and handled by the U.S. court-martial or court-martial authorities. The right of trial for criminal cases committed by Chongqing military personnel stationed in the United States also belongs to Chongqing. Superficially, both parties enjoy equal rights, but the United States had previously publicly announced the abolition of extraterritoriality, and then concluded a military tribunal agreement. The inconsistency and cunning intention are self-evident. It is truly heartbreaking that Chongqing is willing to be deceived and remains unaware.</p>

<p>Milan, 16th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Stefani Agency reports, according to the New York Times quoted by the "Sera" newspaper, a revolution has broken out in the department of Choluteca, Honduras, Central America. Its leader is General Davila. It is said that Davila openly opposes the Honduran President's attitude of surrendering to the United States. It is said that Davila has raised an army in Choluteca in the south, and the leader of the opposition party, Umano, has also led armed troops to land in the Tela area. Both departments have declared martial law. The most noteworthy development yesterday was that Honduran government planes strafed a British coast guard patrol boat with machine guns in the Gulf of Hartgette because the Honduran government believed that Umano launched the rebellion in British Honduras, so it retaliated against the British side. The New York Times emphasized that the White House is still adopting a completely reserved attitude, but in Washington, it is generally believed that if the Honduran government is unable to control the situation, the United States will send troops to assist.</p>

<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Colonel Hama, a military correspondent for the German News Agency, declared that on Sunday, a fierce Soviet attack on the left flank of the Kuban bridgehead had been defeated. At dawn, Soviet artillery heavily bombarded the main defensive positions of the German grenadiers. An hour later, Soviet infantry followed up the attack, but were forced to retreat due to intense German defensive fire. Several hours later, the Soviets added reinforcements and attacked again, but also suffered heavy losses and retreated, leaving behind more than a thousand corpses. After suffering two failures in a row, the Soviets changed their strategy and no longer attacked in this section. Only localized warfare occurred in the northeast corner of the Orel River bend. German artillery destroyed five Soviet T-34 tanks. The remaining sections of the Eastern Front were generally quiet. German air activity was significantly hindered by bad weather, but its bomber squadrons were still able to attack railways and factories in the Soviet rear. In addition, German bombers and dive bomber groups attacked Soviet troop concentrations and supply lines northeast of Novorossiysk. Soviet heavy artillery and anti-aircraft positions north of Krymskaya, as well as ships on the sea near Temryuk, were also bombed. Another German bomber squadron attacked railways and airfields in various regions of the North Caucasus. The airfield at Maykop suffered the most damage. Airfields and supply states in the Soviet interior, as well as the railway lines from Starobelsk to Voroshilovgrad, Ryazhsk to Svoboda, and Artyomovsk to Valuyki, were all heavily bombed by German aircraft. Countless vehicles and locomotives were destroyed or damaged.</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>On the 14th, at dawn, the German fleet once again attacked the port of Akhtari in the Sea of Azov, launching a fierce attack on the port facilities and the Soviet convoy in the port. After a fierce naval battle with the intercepting Soviet fleet, it inflicted significant damage and repelled them. The German fleet continued to bombard, and fires broke out in many places in the city of Akhtari and the port facilities. After achieving brilliant results, the German fleet returned to base.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Turkish Prime Minister's Speech: Continuing to Maintain Neutrality <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Ankara, 15th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Turkish Prime Minister Saracoğlu delivered a speech at the closing of the People's Party Congress tonight, stating that the Turkish policy of neutrality established by the late President Kemal has spared the country from the ravages of war. It will continue to be maintained and adhered to unswervingly. In the past four years, our country has faced the danger of war several times, but has been able to avoid it due to the implementation of the late President's sound policies. Turkey's policy of neutrality is to maintain fair friendship with both warring countries. When Germany showed goodwill to us from the Balkans, we signed a non-aggression and friendship treaty with it. This treaty stemmed from the sincere wishes of Turkey and Germany, and various facts have proven that it truly meets the real needs of both countries. This treaty continues to benefit both parties. We also welcome the Soviet Union's efforts to improve relations with us. We have also concluded a friendly agreement with the United States to strengthen bilateral relations, and have signed a treaty of alliance with the United Kingdom. The policy of neutrality has saved us from being drawn into the whirlpool of war. For this reason, we are very optimistic about the future.</p>

<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>According to the German News Agency, diplomatic circles here say that Berlin is deeply impressed by the Fascist Party's resolution to fight to the end, considering it one of the most important declarations in modern Italian history. German political figures believe that those who know the Italian people well and have paid attention to their development in recent decades can infer the enormous resources of Italy developed after the Fascist Party came to power, and believe that the Fascist Party's resolution can prove that a nation with this kind of quality will never be defeated.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Pope Pius XII received the Bishop of Spezia and listened to a report on the recent bombing of Spezia by the anti-Axis air force.

<h3 id="e13">Military Management Implemented in Portuguese Coal Mines <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>A Havas correspondent states that, according to the law promulgated on February 17 of this year, all coal mines in São Pedro da Cova and Pidurido have been mobilized and placed under military management starting on Monday. According to the law promulgated on February 17, all important enterprises are to be classified under military management, with the aim of providing the Portuguese army with sufficient manpower and production. At that time, it was generally believed that this new law would be implemented in labor disputes and strike movements, but in fact, it is now being implemented for the first time to protect workers and increase the efficiency of miners, which is unexpected. It is reported that the previous management of the mines currently under military management was extremely poor, resulting in a monthly decline in output. The sanitary conditions of the workers were very poor, and the safety equipment was also incomplete. Now that the mines are directly under the management of the Army, all equipment will be improved. The miners all hope that this will develop a new work ethic to increase production. Although there is a shortage of grain in northern Portugal, the workers will be provided with meals by the factory, with quantities almost indistinguishable from military rations. In addition, the workers will be provided with uniforms by the factory, which is believed to boost morale.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Japanese Youth Corps Launches Various Activities to Strengthen National War Effort <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Since its official establishment in January of Showa 16 (1941), the Japanese Youth Corps has been carrying out activities based on two major goals. The first is to strengthen the inseparable relationship with school education and, according to the national youth policy, clarify that all extracurricular life should be provided with essential moral training. The second is to complete the unified organization of youth throughout the country, sweeping away the past liberalist divisions among various groups, in order to establish a consistent training system for boys and girls. Since then, for more than two years, youth training has achieved considerable results. The Japanese Youth Corps is composed of the headquarters and local branches. The headquarters is responsible for controlling and guiding the local branches throughout the country. The local branches are organized into prefectural groups, municipal medical groups, and village/town groups. The basic organizational unit, the unit group, is the most important and can be divided into three parts: the Youth Corps, the Girls' Youth Corps, and the Boys' Corps. The Youth Corps and Girls' Youth Corps of the former youth schools and the Boys' Corps are centered on the national schools and organized according to the areas of their advanced studies, with the principals of the youth schools and national schools serving as the heads of the groups, mobilizing the guiding forces in the area and leading them. According to current surveys, there are 17,523 Youth Corps, 16,457 Girls' Youth Corps, and 18,651 Boys' Corps, with a total membership of approximately 13.29 million. Members are divided into ordinary members and cadre members. Ordinary members are students of youth schools and youths from 14 to 21 years old. Cadre members are cadres of the Youth Corps from 21 to 25 years old, who are filled with appropriate instructors. The Youth Corps focuses on training based on the current state of conscription and the importance of youth school education. Ordinary members are the direct targets, while cadre members guide those who come after them as youth instructors, so that the entire Youth Corps can automatically exert the will of the youth themselves. The Girls' Youth Corps is composed of female students of youth schools and unmarried women from 14 to 25 years old. Recently, girls from general girls' schools and higher girls' schools have also participated, and the number of members is expected to increase dramatically.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Miscellaneous Thoughts While Traveling in Beiping Four Times <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Fohai</p>
<p>Reprinted from "Ancient and Modern Bi-monthly" Issue No. 25</p>
<p>I have been to Beiping a total of four times. However, each time I only stayed for two weeks, or as little as six or seven days. Therefore, I really cannot talk about observing and understanding Beiping. What is recorded in this article are just some miscellaneous feelings that arose from each trip to the north.</p>
<p>The first time I went to Beiping was in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, when the Northern Expedition was completed. I have already mentioned it in my article "Having Read the Prosperous Yuan, I Have Exhausted the Vicissitudes of Life". At that time, my spirit was high, my interest was strong, and my hopes were great, I was truly unparalleled. After offering sacrifices to the spirit at Biyun Temple and reporting the completion of the Northern Expedition, I held a grand dinner party at the Foreign Affairs Building. All the main cadres of the four groups attended, and the four commanders-in-chief all gave speeches with great pleasure. This grand occasion is still vivid in my mind. Three years ago, during my third visit, and this year during my fourth visit to Beiping, friends from the North China Political Affairs Commission also hosted banquets for me at the Foreign Affairs Building. Closing my eyes and meditating, I felt as if I were in the midst of that grand gathering back then. However, times have changed, and everything is different, which truly evokes a feeling of extreme desolation and bitterness!</p>
<p>When we first arrived, we stayed in the detached palace next to Biyun Temple. Li Zi, Bu Lei, and Li Fu and I shared a room. We all loved to have fun, so at night we would sneak into the city to open a hotel, and naturally, local friends would arrange everything for us. Li Zi and Bu Lei were addicted to mahjong, so they could be satisfied by having a few players play mahjong in the hotel. Li Fu and I neither played mahjong nor were we young and active, so we went from house to house for guerrilla-style tea gatherings. At dawn, the four of us would sneak out of the city and return to Biyun Temple. Later, Mr. Chiang also moved into the city, which made it even more convenient for us, because at that time we were all staff members, and we were not afraid of others criticizing any romantic behavior, and others would not criticize us. After having enough tea gatherings in Beiping, Li Fu and I took two days off to go to Tianjin. Because we were afraid that the people from the local party headquarters would find out and invite us to give lectures, we kept it secret. After checking into the hotel, the two of us went out and called two rickshaws, saying that we were going to a tea garden. The rickshaw pullers took us to a low-class place, with a foul smell, which made us both laugh and cry. After finally finding our way, we were found out by the comrades from the provincial party headquarters, and as a result, we were still dragged to give a lecture once. The comrades from the party headquarters wanted to send us on the train, so Li Fu and I secretly discussed letting them send us to the second station and then taking the train back to Tianjin from Beiping. However, because the holiday was over, it was never implemented. However, the high level of interest at that time can be imagined. "Heroes grow old and their ambitions are in vain." The heroic spirit of those years has now disappeared. Therefore, I also feel that my vitality has temporarily diminished.</p>
<p>The first time I went to Beijing, I naturally wanted to visit the Forbidden City. There were too many people visiting together that time. In addition to the four of us, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Zhang Zhizhong, Liu Zhenhua, and others were also together. Mixed in with the large crowd, I could not carefully observe according to my personal wishes, but only took a cursory look.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the three main halls, everyone thought they were great and solemn. At that time, I felt that this was a method used by ancient people to rule the people. If one person rules many people, they must make this person rich in mystery and color, in other words, they must make them deified. Because everyone is human, why should one person give orders and many people obey? Why can some people control others, and some people must be controlled? Before the development of modern legal concepts, these ruling relationships must be made very mysterious, and to be mysterious, one must rely on the arrangement of the environment. Moreover, no matter how great a person is, those who are close to him will definitely not feel that he is great. Qin Shihuang, Genghis Khan, and Napoleon, no matter how great they are, their close attendants, especially their wives, respect them far less than people who are not close to them worship them. Therefore, if their environment is not arranged to be solemn and mysterious, so that the general public feels that they are great and that they are sacred and inviolable, the relationship of rule will be shaken. From entering the Meridian Gate, you have to walk until you are out of breath before you reach the main hall, which is to first make you feel that the emperor is like being in the sky, so that you feel that it is right to bow your head and obey him. This is not only the case with the court at that time, but even a county yamen, from the gate to the main hall, has such a considerable distance. These principles were studied a lot at that time. Unfortunately, after the Republic of China, these mysterious methods were swept away. When I say this, some people will definitely scold me for having a bureaucratic mentality and feudal thinking. In fact, it is not like that. No matter how democratic it is, the system and ceremony are always indispensable. The United States can be regarded as a democratic country, but when their president goes out, he is always surrounded by police cars making strange noises. People who have not been to the United States must have seen it in movie news. What is the difference between this and the gongs and drums that used to be used to clear the way in China? What is the difference between this and the tall "Quiet" and "Avoid" signs that officials used to carry when they went out? As for the solemnity and mystery of Stalin's residence and actions, there is no need to say more. Therefore, making the ruler a little more mysterious and making the place where he lives and sleeps a little more solemn may not be completely unnecessary in politics. Looking at the solemn and majestic palaces, I could not help but think to myself. At that time, I also felt regret that I was not born a few decades earlier and had not tasted the experience of "attending court." The year I started learning to write articles, the imperial examination was abolished. I have never tasted the taste of science and always felt regret. At that time, after seeing the prosperity of the court, I added another regret. However, if the imperial system were restored and I were called to the Hall of Mental Cultivation to attend court, would it be enjoyable? This is also impossible. Because the mysterious coat has been taken off once, and if you put it on again, it is no longer the original state. The paper tiger has been pierced, so what is the point of pasting it back? These are the boring miscellaneous thoughts that occurred when I visited the various palaces all year round.</p>
<p>Visiting the palace is another feeling. I immediately thought of the prosperity of the concubines and the beauty of the palace maids in those years. Therefore, I felt particularly interested in the relics and legends of the concubines. Thinking of the romantic and beautiful things of the past, I couldn't help but feel fascinated. When Li Houzhu said goodbye to the temple, he did not shed tears for his ancestors, but shed tears for the palace maids. When I visited the palace, I immediately thought of the past events of the palace maids. I thought: If I were an emperor in the feudal era, no one would control me, and I would not be afraid of attacks. To put it mildly, I would definitely be a romantic emperor. To put it badly, I would probably be a monarch who would ruin the country!</p>
<p>The first time I visited the political center for hundreds of years, there were of course many other historical and political feelings. They are dry and tasteless, so there is no need to write them here.</p>
<p>The second time was in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China. This time, I did not have the same interest as the first time. Because at this time, the battle against Gui in Wuhan and the battle against Feng in western Henan had already passed. The First Army and the Second and Fourth Armies had fought each other. The leader of the Third Army, Yan Xishan, retreated to advance, claiming to accompany Feng to go abroad. Our trip to Beiping this time was to keep Yan. Under these circumstances, what kind of interest was there? Leaving aside the political situation, only Bu Lei and I accompanied this time, without Li Zi and Li Fu. Bu Lei was quiet. How could I have fun alone? Therefore, although I also went to places like Hanjiatan and Baishun Hutong this time, it was just social interaction. After the wine and red lights, and after the singing and dancing, I deeply felt that the world was getting worse and worse, and the road ahead was full of thorns.</p>
<p>One feeling I had during this trip to Ping was the greatness of the bureaucratic forces. The so-called bureaucrats refer to administrative officials. When I first came to Ping, there were many bureaucrats left over from the old government, and they were all at a loss. This time, the number of these gentlemen in Beiping has decreased a lot, and they have all gone to Nanjing to participate in the National Government, and many of them are very proud. At that time, there was a saying in Nanjing that "military Northern Expedition, political Southern Expedition." This means that although the National Revolutionary Army has established Youyan, the Beiping bureaucrats have brought the atmosphere of corruption to the new capital in the Southern Expedition. I think this is inevitable, because administrative officials are the basic elements of a government. No matter how wise your political leader is, no matter how suitable your policies and programs are for the needs of the times, without good administrative officials to implement them, everything is just a fantasy, just a piece of paper. The revolutionary party, to be honest, has many heroes from the grass-roots level. Although there are also many students who have studied abroad, most of them can only talk about theory and do not have the experience and training in administrative skills. There are quite a few comrades who can be good political officials, but there are indeed not many who can be good administrative officials. Under these circumstances, the administrative officials left over from the old government will of course rise. At that time, many young comrades of the Kuomintang complained a lot about this phenomenon, thinking that they had risked their lives to fight for the world, but these gentlemen were enjoying the ready-made benefits. In fact, this is not the case. After the Russian Communist Revolution, the technicians and specialists of the Tsarist era were not only still employed, but also treated better. This is an inevitable fact. Who told our revolutionary comrades to only know how to be ambitious and talk about theory, but not to earnestly receive training in administrative skills?</p>
<p>The main purpose of the second trip to Ping was to unite Yan and exclude Feng, but it was not achieved. Before I could do anything, I returned to Nanjing. Yan then issued a telegram of courtesy to the country, inviting Chiang to go abroad. The Central Plains War then broke out.</p>
<p>The third time I went to Beiping was in the twenty-ninth year of the Republic of China, not long after the National Government returned to its capital. At this time, the city walls were still the same, but everything had changed. There is no need to talk about how deep and painful the feelings of the times were. Now, I will only talk about my personal miscellaneous feelings.</p>
<p>After getting off the plane and entering the city through Xizhimen, I saw that all pedestrians were blocked on Lande Road. After passing the intersection of the trams, I saw more than a dozen trams stopped motionless like a long snake. I was very surprised and asked the people who welcomed me, only to find out that the traffic was cut off according to the scheduled time, but my special plane was half an hour late, so the traffic on the street had been cut off for a long time, causing so many trams to stop. For me alone, the citizens of Zhongbei felt such inconvenience. At that time, I was ashamed, apologetic, and uneasy. After that, every time I went out, the roads I passed were still blocked. After repeated requests, it was finally stopped on the third day. However, in front of and behind the car, there were not only two electric mules, shouting and embracing, but also a large truck of armed guards. The local authorities, because of their responsibilities, refused to lift these no matter how much they asked. I said earlier that a responsible person must be mysterious in order to make people respect them. This is generally speaking. If such a method is applied to me, it will really kill me. A few more guards made me feel restless, let alone others. However, more than 30 years ago, even princes and ministers did not completely block traffic when they went out. As a poor student, I was actually able to block traffic in and out of the capital of emperors for hundreds of years, and unconsciously I felt proud, but it was not like this more than 30 years ago, and it was not like this when China was unified, and I really felt that it was not perfect.</p>
<p>This time, I lived in Qin Zhengdian in Zhongnanhai. Opposite was Yingtai, where Dezong was imprisoned. Sleeping in the palace at night, I thought of the Wuxu coup, the disharmony between the two palaces, the tragic life Dezong lived in Yingtai, and the many secret situations in the palace. Thoughts were surging, and I could not fall asleep. Suddenly, I had a whim. If I could live in this place more than 30 years ago, I don't know what the situation would be. Although this place is not a place where ordinary people can live in casually now, I still feel that it would be much better to live here more than 30 years ago.</p>
<p>The fourth time I visited Beiping was in April of this year. Because I had asked my friends from the North China Political Affairs Commission not to give me a grand reception, the traffic was not cut off, but the two electric mules in front of and behind the car were still shouting and embracing. The place where I lived was still Qin Zhengdian. Fortunately, Wang Yitang opened a few rooms for me at the Six Nations Hotel. I saw guests at Qin Zhengdian during the day, and slept at the Six Nations Hotel at night. I like the life of a hotel, and living here is much more comfortable than living in the empty, large, and useless Qin Zhengdian.</p>
<p>The Six Nations Hotel is in Dongjiaomin Lane. This was my first time staying there. Living here, I immediately thought of the situation where the Boxers besieged this place, and I thought of the situation where the Eight-Nation Alliance entered Beijing. Although the capital of that year had been occupied by the Anglo-French Allied Forces once, causing Wenzong to flee to Rehe, China's vitality had not been greatly damaged after all. The Gengzi Incident made China unable to recover. Arriving at this sad place and thinking of the sad past, I felt even sadder. However, as soon as I thought of the national flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth being able to fly in this area, I immediately turned sadness into joy, and deeply felt that everything depends on human effort, and that shedding a drop of blood can definitely reap the effect of shedding a drop of sweat, and strengthened my determination to fight.</p>
<p>Accompanied by Shu Hui, I went to Biyun Temple to pay homage to the Prime Minister's tomb of clothes and hats, and also visited Yuquan Mountain and the Summer Palace. It was the time when all kinds of flowers were in full bloom, which greatly helped our interest in sightseeing. These places were all old places revisited, and there were no special feelings. Suddenly, I remembered that I had been to Ping several times, but I had never been to Jingshan. This historically sad place must be visited, especially the place where Sizong martyred himself, to pay homage.</p>
<p>Standing at the highest point of Jingshan, you can see the entire panorama of the palace, you can see Beihai and Zhongnanhai, and you can even see the entire city. I liked this place very much and stayed there for a long time before slowly going down the mountain. After passing the place where Emperor Sizong of Ming martyred himself, stroking the ancient trees, I couldn't help but feel sad. Although Sizong was the monarch who died for his country, he was able to die for his country and was unwilling to make the ugly gesture of being a servant serving wine. Hundreds of years later, he is still respected. "I am not the monarch who ruined the country, but the ministers are the ministers who ruined the country." In this painful and simple statement, it can be seen that he was also an emperor who wanted to achieve something. Unfortunately, there was no one to assist him, resulting in such a tragic result. Pondering the ancients and weighing the current situation, I couldn't help but feel chills down my spine!</p>
<p>The food problem in North China is very serious. I heard that hundreds of people starve to death in Beiping every day. Hearing this, I felt sad and heartbroken. I often think that I don't have any special enjoyment, but just eat three meals a day and sleep on one bed at night. Now that I think about it, I am already very lucky. I have three meals a day to eat and don't need to eat grass roots and tree leaves; I have a bed to sleep on at night and don't need to sleep on cement. What is this if not special enjoyment? In the midst of special enjoyment, we must not forget the sufferings of the people. Of course, there are difficulties in the environment and limitations in ability. In the end, how much pain can be relieved for the people in reality and how much welfare can be sought is a question, but the heart cannot but be exhausted. If the heart is exhausted and the strength is not enough, you will not feel guilty to the gods and ashamed of the people. If you don't even think about it, you will have no soul and no heart. I use this to warn myself and encourage myself!</p>
<p>I have been to Beiping four times, and the situation has been different each time. The first time was when the Northern Expedition was completed, and I was most happy. The second time was when the civil war started, and I had no interest. The third time was after the National Government returned to its capital, and I was both sad and happy. The fourth time was after the declaration of war against the United Kingdom and the United States, and I had unlimited expectations for the future. Each time has a different historical background, and each time has different joys and sorrows. I hope that the fifth time I go to Beiping, the internal unification will be completed, and the external peace will be established. The freedom and equality of China sought in the Prime Minister's will will also be fully realized. We will go to Biyun Temple, the Prime Minister's tomb of clothes and hats, and hold another grand sacrificial ceremony!</p>

<h3 id="e17">Japanese Merchants Discuss Cotton Product Allocation System: Eleven Items Supplied at Low Prices, Possibly Implemented Next Month for Japanese Residents <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>According to Japanese newspapers, the prices of daily necessities have recently soared, posing a significant threat to people's livelihoods. In Nanjing, the authorities have already allocated four items, including cotton, socks, yukata (bathrobes), and towels, to Japanese residents. In Shanghai, a ticket-based allocation system for items such as rice, charcoal, and sugar has been implemented for Japanese residents. Furthermore, there are hopes to establish consumer cooperatives to ensure the low-priced supply of essential goods. To meet these expectations, various discussions are underway among different industries serving Japanese residents.</p>
<p>Planning Committee Discusses Plans</p>
<p>It is learned that the Japanese Merchants' Cotton Product Association of Central China believes that the price of cotton products has risen the most among daily necessities and has a significant impact on people's livelihoods. Therefore, each related association of Japanese cotton product merchants has selected two members to establish the "Central China Japanese Resident Civilian Cotton Product Allocation Planning Committee." After several discussions, a concrete plan has been established.</p>
<p>Eleven Items Allocated Based on Tickets</p>
<p>As for the allocated cotton products, there are a total of eleven items: (1) towels, (2) plain white cloth, (3) bleached cloth, (4) flannel, (5) cotton yarn and foreign yarn money, (6) gauze, (7) absorbent cotton, (8) cloth socks, (9) Western-style socks, (10) undershirts, and (11) shirts. The above eleven items will be allocated based on tickets. The prices will be half or two-thirds of the market price, similar to Nanjing. It is expected to start in July. This move will have a significant impact on Japanese residents.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Press Association, the only united organization of the city's eight major newspapers, sent a telegram to General Pang Bingxun in Nanjing on the 16th, expressing their welcome and condolences. The original telegram stated: "To General Pang Bingxun, transmitted by the Nanjing Military Commission: We are delighted to learn of your arrival in Nanjing to pay respects to Chairman Wang. General, you resolutely participated in the peace movement because Chongqing's dragging out the war only caused suffering to the people. By shifting the power of dragging out the war to cooperate with Japan in destroying the United Kingdom and the United States, completing the Greater East Asia War, and liberating the Chinese nation, your insight and foresight are deeply admired. However, the responsibility is arduous, and we especially rely on your participation in military affairs, planning and strategizing. We look south with anticipation. We respectfully send a telegram of welcome and hope for your consideration. Shanghai Press Association."</p>

<h3 id="e22">The Launch of the Fifth Scholarship Aid Campaign – Please, Readers of This Newspaper, Unite in Enthusiastic Support <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>This newspaper’s advocacy of the scholarship aid campaign is now in its fifth year. Looking back at the past four years, thanks to the enthusiastic support and earnest expectations of society, all of our work has been spared failure, and disadvantaged youths have been able to fulfill their aspirations for education. We should first extend our sincere gratitude to all sectors. As the fifth scholarship aid campaign begins, we ourselves feel the weight of our mission and, filled with boundless hope, dare to express our private thoughts to the warm-hearted individuals in society.</p>
<p>We believe that the scholarship aid campaign has a noble realm, and its profound significance is incomparable to general relief work. The greatest purpose of scholarship aid is to sow seeds of knowledge in society and to cultivate healthy and promising citizens for the next generation. At present, we may not see anything, but its future results will be extremely great. It is like planting trees; when the seedlings are planted, they are truly insignificant, but after several years, they will be verdant and vigorous, reaching straight up to the clouds, unstoppable. Only then will we know that the hard work of cultivation was not in vain. The ancients had a saying, "It takes ten years to grow a tree, but a hundred years to nurture a person." "Nurturing people" is especially an active construction of society, so it has a noble realm. Secondly, our country has never regarded scholarship aid as a charitable act, but confirms that it is a combination of compassion and responsibility. Those who provide scholarship aid do not take pity and charity as their starting point; those who are aided, however, maintain a sense of self-respect and a spirit of striving for progress. What they repay to those who provide scholarship aid is only to seek the promotion and expansion of this compassion and responsibility, and only to seek to help others in the future after gaining self-help, striving to make scholarship aid a fashion, universally extending to all places and all levels. If this can be done, the highest ideal of scholarship aid has been achieved. Therefore, we say that the profound significance of the scholarship aid campaign is incomparable to general relief work.</p>
<p>After the launch of this scholarship aid campaign, what worries us most is that tuition fees in various schools will generally increase next semester. The amount of the increase is currently unknown, but the impact will inevitably cause countless parents and brothers to be unable to afford it, causing their children to drop out of school. At the same time, it is also an inevitable phenomenon that the number of disadvantaged youths who hope for scholarship aid will inevitably increase sharply compared to the previous year. According to the statistics of this newspaper’s past scholarship aid, the number of applicants approved for assistance in the first year was 1,005, with a grant of 33,736.60 yuan; in the second year, 984, with a grant of 51,587.50 yuan; in the third year, 1,223, with a grant of 156,422.50 yuan; and in the fourth year, 1,694, with a grant of 246,016.00 yuan. The number of people approved and the amount of grants have increased rapidly each year. This year, due to the increase in tuition fees in various schools and the eager expectations of disadvantaged youths, the amount of grants we need may be an even larger figure.</p>
<p>Therefore, we earnestly appeal to people from all walks of life to unite and support this scholarship aid campaign. In the past, the cooperation given to us by all sectors was very enthusiastic and moving. We have never used any method to directly solicit donations from the outside world, only relying on a little sincerity and an attitude of impartiality and selflessness to explain to readers the loss of disadvantaged youths to the country and society, hoping that everyone will jointly shoulder this responsibility of scholarship aid. Sure enough, the grants received each time are suitable for our needs and have a surplus. Moreover, we have never considered how to raise funds for the next session. As long as the disadvantaged youths who are well-behaved, motivated, and study hard pass the examination, we will do our best to assist them. Therefore, at the end of each session of grants, there must be little left, and the donations received in the next session are even more enthusiastic than the previous session. We believe that readers are spiritually connected with us, and they will give us supervision and maintenance for the scholarship aid work at any time, and they will definitely give greater sympathy and greater assistance to this scholarship aid.</p>
<p>Due to the increase in tuition fees, one may think of the hardship of teachers. In this turbulent era, the high pressure of life makes everyone breathless, and the suffering of those who work their minds is even greater than that of those who work their bodies. We are determined not to bear to order teachers to teach on an empty stomach and disregard the food and clothing of their families, so everyone unanimously sympathizes with schools increasing tuition fees to improve teachers' salaries. However, there is a most serious problem at present, which is "a teacher changing careers" and "textbook vendors." We know that many specialized teachers cannot maintain their minimum living standards by teaching, so they resign from their positions and engage in other businesses. If they can have ample food and clothing and develop their strengths, it is indeed a good thing for individuals, but it is an irreparable loss for the school's teaching staff. It is necessary to know how much financial resources the country has spent to train an expert teacher. Now that he is engaged in other plans, the school lacks an excellent mentor, and students have no way to relieve their intellectual hunger. This loss is inestimable. As for "textbook vendors," they seek to teach more courses and more hours. During the day, they are busy on the road, regarding lectures as commodities to be sold. Students find it difficult to gain real benefits, and teachers also feel very tired. The above two types of people seem to be undeniable facts. We hope that the school will thoroughly rectify the issue of teachers' salaries after this increase in tuition fees, and strive to ensure that teachers who "change careers" return to their positions, and teachers who "teach concurrently" change to full-time positions. If so, the entire future of education will benefit greatly.</p>
<p>As for the students who apply to this newspaper for assistance, the total number is approximately 5,000 when the four sessions are combined, and the grants used are approximately 500,000 yuan. We do not need to deny this small achievement. We will pay attention to the examination of students' academic performance at any time. Recently, we re-issued forms and asked everyone to fill them out and submit them voluntarily. The purpose is that since the grants are taken from society, whether or not students' academic progress is also a matter of common concern to society, so we have to inquire strictly and take things seriously. What we expect from the aided students is their own awakening, recognizing the times, focusing on reality, not neglecting the responsibilities of the future, not wasting a moment of time, and the way of learning is especially important to get rid of pride and laziness. Only in this way can they advance bravely and vigorously and become a complete talent to serve the country. Mr. Wang Chuanshan once said that scholars take getting rid of pride and laziness as the root of knowledge. Just like climbing a high mountain, climbing one peak will first see the other peak standing above, and looking far away, the highest peak will be in sight early, but in fact, this highest peak is still too high to climb! It can be seen that learning is endless, and we want to use this meaning as a gift of encouragement. In addition, we hope that you will study diligently and practice diligently in addition to reading, and make a lot of hard work in cultivation.</p>
<p>Finally, please, readers who love this newspaper, jointly shoulder this responsibility of scholarship aid, save unnecessary expenses, and donate to this meaningful cause. We should regard these disadvantaged youths as our own children, and everyone should enthusiastically donate to make the scope of scholarship aid more extensive than the previous year, so that disadvantaged youths have the opportunity to study.</p>

<p>In April of this year, Chairman Wang of the National Government, at the request of Mr. Zhu Puzhi, President of Gujin Publishing House, personally wrote an article entitled "Stories of Old Friends." President Zhu deeply felt that poor children were in dire need of assistance. Upon the suggestion of Mr. Chen Binhe, President of this newspaper, and with the consent of Chairman Wang, he agreed to sell the world-famous ink treasure to raise money for the scholarship aid fund of this newspaper. Subsequently, Mr. Er Yu Yushifu, a writer from a friendly country, offered a portion of the royalties from his famous book "In and Out of Prison" and wished to obtain this treasure for 60,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Charity Purchase Price of 60,000 Yuan Received Yesterday <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Er Yu has made many unique contributions to the work of harmony between the people of China and Japan. He recently returned to his country, and we are now receiving the payment from him. His enthusiasm for cultivating Chinese youth is especially worthy of praise. This newspaper's scholarship aid fund has received the assistance of this huge amount of funds, and is deeply grateful for the support of Chairman Wang, President Zhu, and Mr. Er Yu. The students who receive assistance in this session should also pay their respects and thanks.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Application for the Fifth Scholarship Aid of Shenbao Starts on July 1 - Eagerly Hope Scholarship Funds Are Sufficient for Distribution <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The fifth Shenbao Reader Scholarship Aid will begin accepting applications on July 1, as schools have successively held examinations and the summer vacation is approaching. The matter was decided yesterday by the staff of the scholarship aid office after discussion.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the staff of the scholarship aid office discussed and decided the application date for this year's scholarship aid on yesterday afternoon, which is scheduled to begin on July 1. In addition, the staff of each group will be supplemented to ensure that the investigation, selection examination, and review procedures are further improved.</p>
<p>The fund predicts that tuition fees in various schools will increase this year, and the general standard of living has risen repeatedly compared to the previous year. The parents and brothers of poor students will feel that the burden is overwhelming, and they will inevitably increase. The increase in tuition fees and the increase in applicants for assistance will inevitably cause the expenditure of this year's scholarship aid to increase several times compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>The colleagues hope that the colleagues will be aware of the importance of their duties, and they cannot help but call on all sectors of society with this fact, hoping that all sectors will generously donate so that the scholarship aid fund can also have a positive proportion of increasing several times compared to the previous sessions. Then, one more excellent poor student will be admitted to school, and each sector will cultivate one more element of vitality for society.</p>
<p>I am deeply impressed by the enthusiasm. Yesterday, this newspaper received the scholarship aid fund. Mr. Zhao Guangyao of Baofeng Anji Qianzhuang saved 5,000 yuan from the banquet fee, which shows his enthusiasm. Mr. Zhao's letter deeply regretted that the standard of living has increased sharply, and there will be a large group of students who will drop out of school. The words of the benevolent are commendable.</p>

<p>Jin Weigang Case Jiang Lianjiang, a student of Yucaizhongxue School on Shanhai Road, was only sixteen years old, and his classmate Jin Weigang from Pudong was quite close (Jin and Jiang are the same age). Unexpectedly, a crack recently appeared. On the first of this month, Jiang hid a sharp weapon and sneaked into Jin's residence in Room 29, upstairs at No. 89 Jing'ansi Road, and killed Jin with a knife. The judgment was announced, and the main text read: Jiang Lianjiang, also known as Jiang Longxing, committed murder and was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment. In addition, Jiang Lianjiang and Jiang Jie'an shall be jointly and severally liable to compensate Jin Youming (i.e., the father of the deceased) for the loss of funeral expenses, burial land, tomb construction, memorial service, and miscellaneous expenses of 50,504 yuan in new legal currency, and to pay 100,000 yuan in compensation for mental distress, totaling 150,504 yuan.</p>
<p>Huang Wenbiao Case Huang Huang, a Ningbo woman from No. 73, Lane 1462, Aiduya Road, left behind a son named Wenbiao, who was eight years old. On the morning of the 29th of last month, he was playing at the intersection of Foch Road and Chongqing Road when he was suddenly hit and crushed to death by a No. 22 bus driven by Gong Guiqing from Haimen. Gong was also arrested. Yesterday morning, Gong Guiqing was sentenced to five months of imprisonment for causing death due to negligence, and compensated Huang Huang 4,097 yuan and one jiao for funeral expenses.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Cigarette Merchants Involved in the Black Market - Allocation Has Been Suspended <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The Huazhong Tobacco Allocation Association handles the allocation of goods in three phases per month, limiting each wholesale and retail merchant to sell the goods allocated in each phase evenly in ten days, and absolutely not to hoard or resell for profit. Recently, due to the speculation of speculators, the cigarette black market has rekindled and prices have soared. Some dealers and firms are even involved in black market activities. It is reported that the association has found that some dealers and firms have solid evidence, so it has cancelled the right to allocate goods and suspended the allocation. At the same time, it informed the dealers and firms that if the family members and servants of tobacco retailers violate the instructions, the tobacco retailers must be fully responsible. In addition, it hopes that smokers will report at any time to prevent abuses. As for the eighth phase of allocation, the allocation quantity has been stipulated and has been notified separately.</p>
<p>Short Comment</p>
<h3 id="e30">Publication of the Tripitaka <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The Tripitaka is a Buddhist giant. Our country has had the practice of compiling and printing the Tripitaka in all dynasties. Since the Republic of China, due to the changing political environment and the difficulty of compiling and printing such giants, no one has been able to discuss this. Recently, lay Buddhist Sheng You'an made a grand vow to publish the Tripitaka. Yesterday, he discussed the methods, organized a publication association, and first raised funds for administrative expenses and started to proceed. We are overwhelmed with fragrance and wish for the smooth future and ultimate success of this unprecedented event in Buddhism, academia, and culture.</p>
<p>According to the content of the Tripitaka to be published this time, it will be a collection of scriptures and treatises from the Southern and Northern traditions, encompassing the teachings of the Buddha in his lifetime, and the Southern tradition is especially lacking in the compilations and printings of the past dynasties, which is even more valuable. In addition, it will supplement other important works not recorded in the various Tripitakas, and correct and collate the errors in the printed wood of previous generations and the differences in the meaning of translations. All of these will contribute greatly to academic and cultural contributions.</p>
<p>However, we naturally sincerely expect this arduous work to be accomplished soon. However, precisely because it is too difficult and too huge, it is easy to fall by the wayside if it is not carried out with perseverance and persistence. We not only sincerely hope that lay Buddhist Sheng will start well and end well, and preside over the matter, leaving an immortal page in the history of Buddhist culture, but also hope that those who cooperate with him will work to the end with the same will, so that after a certain period of time, we will be able to meet this new Tripitaka.</p>
<p>Mr. Ye Gongchuo is erudite and has studied the Tripitaka extensively. The opinions he expressed are stable and practical, and are sufficient for the publishing association to pay attention to and refer to. In addition, the publishing association is located in Jing'an Temple, which is a famous ancient temple in this city. A famous temple and a famous scripture complement each other.</p>
<h3 id="e31">A New Historical Contribution to the Buddhist Community – Compilation and Printing of the Puhui Tripitaka <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Since the Song Dynasty, all dynasties in our country have published the Buddhist Tripitaka. Since the founding of the Republic of China, neither the government nor society has discussed this matter. Recently, Sheng You'an initiated the compilation and printing of the Puhui Tripitaka (Puhui is Sheng's Dharma name). In addition to first assisting with 500,000 yuan in administrative expenses, he is actively planning to proceed. Yesterday, he invited Buddhist scholars and celebrities to a meeting at Jing'an Temple. Those who attended included Yuci, Chisong, Zhifeng, Li Sihao, Tao Xiquan, Jiang Zhuzhuang, Ding Fubao, Wu Yunzhai, Chen Binhe, etc., and decided on the compilation plan. In addition to collecting and supplementing important works not recorded in the Tripitakas of the past dynasties, the entire Southern Transmission Tripitaka will also be included. The Southern Transmission Tripitaka was transmitted to South India during the Ashoka period and has never been transmitted to China. This is the first time to translate it. The completion of this plan will be a collection of Buddhist scriptures from the Southern and Northern traditions, which is a creation in the history of Buddhist culture. Yesterday, Ye Gongchuo sent a letter to Tao Xiquan detailing his opinions. The original letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>Ye Gongchuo's Opinion on Compilation and Printing: Shangwu in Guihu, Liang Qie Yichi, Brother Du Men Yang, has not yet reached the people, especially afraid of the reward, because the stomach is weak, going out to eat and drink, will be sleepy for a few days, very painful also, on the sixteenth day, Cheng Gong and Brother You'an invited to a banquet, urgently want to talk, and Wen You'an Brother Xun asked about walking down, the intention is very cordial, especially want to see, but because of the past situation, and these few days, there is a small cold, did not dare to go out, apologized very much, Wei Wen Jing'an's meeting, is about the Puken Tripitaka to proceed, this is the first grand event in thirty years of the Republic of China, heard the dance, brother to the Tripitaka of the past dynasties, research has been, privately constant said that the Song, Yuan, Ming, Qing, Liao, Jin dynasties, there is no mention of the compilation and printing of the Buddhist Tripitaka, the Republic of China alone no one mentioned, is the shame of the country, had spoken to Dai Li Wang Yiting, very thought it was so, has not been mentioned also. Song Zhihuang Fusi Creek Wanshou, Qisha of the Ming Dynasty, five kinds of Tripitaka, all not fake national power, Youweng this move, enough to succeed the predecessors, only when this environment changes dramatically, to make this matter to the end, we must first have a meticulous plan, otherwise it is easy to give up halfway, turn things around, and violate the original wish. Stealing this matter first should first determine the compilation outline, the second according to the outline, determine the budget, today's compilation and printing of the Tripitaka, such as following the old Tripitaka of the past, there is no need to do this again. It is said that some people advocate that the Daizheng Tripitaka should be checked and collated, which is a laborious and thankless move, because the five kinds of Tripitaka on which it is based, I still have no original (Liza cannot be obtained), not to mention that there is another basis to correct its errors. In my opinion, today's compilation of the Tripitaka in the Republic of China has a very important point, that is, to collect the lost and dispersed books of the Tripitaka in China before. According to the lost and dispersed books of the Tripitaka, there are no more than a few reasons, one because the emperor is correcting the official or the monk is holding political and religious private views, and is not allowed to enter the Tripitaka. The second reason is that the emperor, prime minister and officials hold private views on the government and religion and withdraw them from the Tripitaka. The third single line is that the solitary water has not been handed down to the world far away has not been included in the Tripitaka. The fourth is that distant land has been seen in China. The fifth is that the writings of Zhi Na after Yongzheng were not included in the Tripitaka. Although these five cannot give their names and numbers, it is credible that there are many, and there must be very value, and it is suitable for what should be done and can be done today. Because today's culture is smooth, it is easy to interview, and the political taboos and stubbornness have been eliminated, and the various obstacles in the past can be said to be no longer there. If we do not engage in it in time, it is a shame to this era. Today's compilation of the Tripitaka must take this as the main purpose and central point, and it is not impossible to add any other items, and the time and financial resources are regarded as the progress program. Only today's living standards are high, and prices are rising endlessly. If there is no general calculation first, it will lead to a dilemma. Stealing that printing is a matter of the future, but at present there must be a plan in advance, just like building a house, we must look at the site and the water, today's carving wood is no longer necessary (because the price is too high and the work is too slow) typesetting and stone printing have a lot of room for deliberation, the best is to use the method of publishing books in batches, the whole Tripitaka is based on one hundred large books, assuming that it is divided into five batches or ten batches, such as ten batches then ten books in each batch, the cost of interviews, purchases, compilations, copying, checking, printing and printing is at least 500,000 yuan (starting with 200 copies), that is, the cost of each ten books is 2,500 yuan, and the cost of each book is 250 yuan. Selling after printing, I am afraid it will be difficult to make a profit. Assuming that half of it is 250,000 yuan, then another 250,000 yuan must be paid. Such a cycle, with a period of ten years, cannot be called urgent. If you feel that this number is too huge and the period is too long, then fifty large books are the standard, or half of the expenses can be reduced, then the content must also be changed accordingly. Such a big event must not be started rashly, so as not to leave the criticism of the tiger's head and snake's tail, and to be sorry for Youweng. As for interviewing the lost and dispersed books, it is important to be cautious in choosing, but there must be no views of sects, and it should be changed to the accumulated ills of the past, in order to remove the rough and get the essence, eliminate the false and preserve the true, and should pay attention to the obscure and scattered writings of each sect, so that the essence of Buddhism will be revealed to the world through this, and its merits are really unimaginable. In the illness, I occasionally saw something, and I used it to contribute to the left and right, hoping to help the high and deep, and the rest of the details, should be considered by later generations, not urgent.

<p>Economic Circles - Small Remarks on Bank Capital Increase and Merger Issues</p>
<p>It was reported the other day that bank capital must reach at least three million yuan, and in recent months, newly established banks have been carrying out capital increases one after another. This is entirely due to the banks' own initiative and preventive policy, so that if the government does issue such an order, they will not be caught unprepared. In fact, a capital of one or two million yuan is indeed difficult to operate with now, so in order to strengthen their strength and facilitate deployment, banks have taken the step of increasing capital and expanding.</p>
<p>Because banks have a tendency to increase capital, there are rumors that smaller banks need to merge. Mergers have precedents in foreign countries, and there have also been examples in our country, but it is not a very simple matter. Here is a brief description of a few points that I have thought of regarding capital increases and mergers:</p>
<p>(1) If the government does have a plan to adjust the banks, it must have practical measures to give the banks a reasonable period of time to engage in capital increase or merger, and it will never suddenly issue an order, merely causing the banks to be caught off guard. Therefore, banks do not need to worry too much. However, judging from the trend, banks should also prepare for a rainy day and plan for it early.</p>
<p>(2) If smaller banks must merge, the government will only be in a position to guide and urge them, and the banks must plan and proceed properly on their own. Because each bank has its own background, history, and current situation. In addition, personnel issues are the most troublesome, and it is not possible to merge at once. Therefore, mergers are not as easy as commonly heard and said.</p>
<p>(3) There are various different ways and degrees of merging. First, a complete merger, that is, two or more banks are completely merged into one organization. Second, centralized management, that is, a management company controls the shares of two or more banks. Third, interlocking management, that is, one person or several people hold shares in several banks and serve as directors of several banks in order to obtain business contacts and cooperation. It is not uncommon for the third situation to exist now, and further contact may be possible. Therefore, mergers also have to be handled according to the situation, and there is quite a bit of flexibility.</p>
<p>(4) When it comes to the actual credit and financial strength of a bank, it is really impossible to judge solely on the basis of capital, but capital is an indicator that is easy to compare. In the past, few old banks had capital of four or five million yuan, while new banks with capital of four or five million yuan are common. Therefore, new and old banks cannot be judged in the same way. If the old bank truly has strong assets, even if it is to comply with the law and increase shares and capital, it will naturally not be a problem.</p>
<p>(5) There are already many new banks that have increased capital, and it is inevitable that some of them have increased capital due to the lack of working capital. If this is the case, then the bank's past operating policies must also be wrong. The newly added funds must not be used for stagnant or improper purposes. The money market may not be overly tight again, but it will not become very loose in the near future. Maintaining the liquidity of funds is the most important principle of operating a commercial bank, and this is what banks should pay special attention to.</p>
<p>In short, the government, under the policy of rectifying finance, should be considerate of business difficulties and take appropriate measures. However, banks should be more self-disciplined and strive to become more robust, moving towards the safest path.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Flour Association Petitions for Re-division of Anhui Province into Anqing, Wuhu, and Bengbu Regions <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the National Flour Industry Association has been proceeding smoothly with its various tasks. In the past, Anhui Province was divided into Southern Anhui and Northern Anhui by the grain management authorities to manage the allocation and purchase of flour raw materials throughout the province. Anqing County was affiliated with the Northern Anhui region. Recently, the Anhui Province Flour Association specifically submitted a document to the National Flour Industry Association, requesting that the Anhui Province region be re-divided, canceling the original names of Southern Anhui and Northern Anhui, and dividing it into three regions: Anqing, Wuhu, and Bengbu. The counties and towns under the jurisdiction of the three regions are: (1) Anqing region, which governs the nine counties of Huaining, Tongling, Guichi, Dongliu, Wangjiang, Hukou, Pengze, Tongcheng, and Susong; (2) Wuhu region, which governs the nine counties of Wuhu, Fanchang, Yicheng, Wuwei, Hexian, Hanshan, Hefei, Chaoxian, and Dangtu; and Bengbu region, which governs the ten counties of Chuxian, Jiashan, Fengyang, Huaiyuan, Wuhe, Shouxian, Fengtai, Jinjiao, and Laian. The Flour Association has approved the review and has submitted a document to the Ministry of Food and the Commerce and Trade Control Board, requesting consideration and approval.</p>

<p>In the past, salt tax under the Ministry of Finance was submitted to the national treasury by various districts. However, the tax bureaus still submitted it to their respective offices for summary and transfer. Now, in order to unify the handling, in addition to the income tax, which has been directly submitted to the national treasury since last month, all provincial, regional, and bureau consolidated taxes, stamp taxes, tobacco and alcohol taxes, mineral taxes, and silk construction special donations should also follow the practice of salt tax starting next month, and be directly submitted to the national treasury by the tenth day of the following month. At the same time, reports will be submitted to the departments in order to connect the administration and return to consistency.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate Chinese and Japanese grain merchants and understand the grain business in the province, the Jiangsu Provincial Grain Bureau specifically negotiated with the Japanese Consulate in Suzhou on the procedures for Chinese and Japanese grain merchants to transport grain, and submitted it to the provincial government for transfer to the Ministry of Food for record. The details of these regulations are as follows: (A) For Chinese merchants, (1) Chinese merchants transporting major grain commodities must have a certificate issued by their respective trade associations, and only after it has been registered and stamped by the Jiangsu Provincial Grain Bureau can it be approved for transportation. (2) Those who hold permits from the Sino-Japanese General Chamber of Commerce and Trade Control must also register with the Jiangsu Provincial Grain Bureau before they can be moved. (B) For Japanese merchants, the Japanese Consulate in Suzhou is responsible for registering and stamping according to the above method, and the registration situation will be summarized and sent to the Provincial Grain Bureau every ten days for verification. It is also heard that in the future, regardless of whether Chinese or Japanese grain merchants fail to comply with these procedures and move grain, once discovered, they will be severely punished.</p>

<p>Futung Bank, having been approved by the Ministry of Finance to resume operations, began announcing its resumption of business the day before yesterday. In recent days, Chairman Song Xueqin, General Manager Jiang Weihang, and Manager Song Shuyu of the bank have been actively adjusting and arranging various businesses after the resumption of operations, and they are extremely busy. Previously, the bank was suspected of being involved in the Zhenhua Company, but the Ministry of Finance has investigated and found that it was not involved, and since then the truth has been revealed.</p>
<p>The "Pocket Hua Share Treasure Book" distributed by the Hua Share Daily News Agency has received such enthusiastic orders that it has long exceeded the planned amount, so it has been decided to actively prepare for printing. However, because the content of the book is purely based on direct interviews, and all investigations must be based on the latest approved manuscripts from various companies and factories, and the table-based method is used for the first time in Roman typesetting, the arrangement procedure takes a lot of time, and it is expected that it can be published before the end of July.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cotton Industry Association has established its first board of directors, including Xu Hewu and Ruan Zhixiang, and fifteen others. Chen Taosheng and Ruan Zhiyi, and seven others, were supervisors.
