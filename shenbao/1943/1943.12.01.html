<h3 id="c1">光明的方向 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>讀　汪主席對上海各大學及高中靑年團訓詞「光明的方向」，感覺站在輿論的立傷，應該有許多話要說。雖然，關於什麼是今日中國靑年的「光明的方向」這一個問題，汪主席巳經明白地指示出來了，但是，在走上這「光明的方向」之前，似乎有幾個問題，不僅為今日的靑年羣衆未獲正確的答案，而為靑年們之父兄的，也未得到肯定的理解。</p>
<p>毫無疑問的，今日中國靑年，實際上澤是徬徨在岐途上。展開在他們面前的，並不是「光明的方向」。為什麼？最緊要的原因，誠如汪主席所指示的，是「大抵靑年心中，對於國家社會的現狀，都是不滿的，尤其在此存亡危急的時代，靑年的心境，較不滿二字，更不知超過若干倍，」這眞是打中靑年們心坎裏的話。不過，除開這個主要原因即對現狀不滿之外，當然還有其他原因，使靑年們不能走上「光明的方向」的，也是我們所不應該忽視的。</p>
<p>現在靑年們的心境，由於自已的生活壓迫而對國家社會現狀表示不滿的，如汪主席所謂「私心」，「鄙薄的心事」，固然也不少，然而我們就平常接觸有大多數靑年，尤其是大中學生而論，這種成份，似乎較少，因為他們或她們所受實際生活的壓迫比較的輕些，所以不滿者，似乎「純出於公」了。但是，我們眼看愛國的日本靑年，却完全不是如此，當政府為强化國內決戰態勢而停止文法經各科學生延期入伍時，成千成萬的大學生，慷慨激昂，辟別母校，辭別家庭，集中到國家支配之下，到生產第一綫去！到決戰第一綫去！多麽高興！請問：為什麽同為東亞靑年，同為出於愛國熱忱，而中國靑年則多對現狀不滿而迷妄於「光明的方向」之外呢？是誰的責任？應該如何努力勸導？除了學校靑年之外，一般社會上的靑年，或是已經在社會服務的靑年，可以說，迷失其「光明的方向」而徬徨於歧途的比較更多，因此事態也更嚴重些。雖然對於現狀之不滿是一樣的，然而動機與結果則有多少差別。有些人因生活壓迫而對現狀不滿，純出於私心，可是，請問：為什麽使靑年感受生活的壓迫呢？或是說，靑年人在今日，不容為自己生活壓迫，而對現狀表示不滿的「鄙薄的心事」，但為什麽靑年們不自知其為鄙薄的心事呢？而且，設老實話，一般社會靑年中，知道對現狀不滿的似乎已經是比較有些靈魂的了，我們今日最害怕的，是另有大批靑年，連這一點「不滿」的感覺也沒有，忘却了東亞的命運，忘却了國家的前途，忘却了社會的責任，也不計自己的前途，只是「今日有酒今日醉一，夜夜上舞廳，天天進賭塲，乃至花天酒地胡作胡為的墜落下去！再請問這種現象，危險到如何程度？是誰的責任？應該如何去指導扶助與拯救，使面對「光明的方向」？</p>
<p>靑年是國家民族的命脈，廣大靑年之彷徨於「光明的方向」之外，甚至墮落於黑暗罪惡的陷阱，這是國家民乃至社會無上的危險。然而，除了責望靑年朋友之外，我們敢在這裏請問：今日之為家長父兄者，今日之為師長先進者，今日之為社會領袖者，尤共是今日之為政府與敎育當局者，是否巳經以身作則，並且盡了對全國靑年應盡的責任？我們看到日本父老高高與與地歡送其于弟上前綫去的事實，不能不在讀了汪主席「光明的方向」這訓詞之後，而有感於這幾個問題必須鄭重地提出來討論！</p>

<p>東京三十甘中央社電　日大本營三十日下午三時三十分發表：帝國海軍航空部隊，二十八日傍晚攻擊停泊於瑪金島環確內敵運輸船團，所獲戰果如次：擊沉大型巡洋艦一艘，擊毀大型巡洋艦一艘（重創起火），運輸船一艘（重創起火）。我方無損害。</p>
<p>東京三十日中央社電　此間軍事專家，對美軍於吉爾員特羣島登陸作戰，發表見解如次：就日大本營發表之戰果推斷，集結於吉爾貝特羣島之敵方艦隊，當為一擁有十數艘航空母艦，數十艘戰艦，巡洋艦，驅逐艦之大聯合艦隊，敵太平洋之海上勢力，想必悉擊於此。由此大艦隊護送而來之運輸船團，其所戰之登陸軍，約當吉爾貝特羣島方面日軍之十倍。敵軍所以出動如此大艦隊，進攻中部太平洋者，蓋因於西南太平洋波根維爾方面之進攻，巳遭日方堅強之防　與反攻，復受重大損失，而奪同拉巴爾之企圖又歸失敗。</p>

<p>民族主義復活</p>
<p>（續昨）如上所述、民元前後、民族主義未得其全，民十前後，索性離開民族主義，一般青年對於光明方向，彷徨不定，模糊不淸，不但苦悶，而且浪　了許多心血，如今呢民族主義復活了，不但復活而且健全了，中日同盟條約，大東亞宣言·詳言之是東亞各個國家民族，各得到獨立自主，同時致力於共存共榮，簡言之東亞民族四個大字，可以包括這裏頭沒有忽咯了各個的獨立性，也沒有忽略了各個的共同性，為什麼只說東度不說世界呢，因為整個世界都要被英美所呑噬，所余的只是東亞，集合東亞的民族，共同奮鬦，使不為英笑所吞噬，再進一步，將其他巳被吞噬的都從英美口中給掏出來，所以東亞主義才眞是世界主義，這樣一來，光明方向由彷徨而緊定了，由糊模而清晣了，所謂劃時期　，其意義實在於此。</p>
<p>對於自己國家社會的不滿有由鄙薄之念而起的，有由　之深愛之切而起的，前者會拋棄了自己國家社會，後者不然，只要尋出一個救國家救社會的方向，定然能夠鼓起勇氣，走向前去，雖然前途是有障碍的，猶陸路之有荊棘，水路之有波浪，這不是意外，毋寗是意中，只要鼓起勇氣一直的走向前去，對於這些障碍？一定能以刻苦耐勞勇猛的精神將他掃除。</p>
<p>再無徘徊余地</p>
<p>青年諸君，我們在這時代所能走的，只有這個方向了，因為在這時代不為東亞同志，便為東亞叛逆，再沒有徘徊的余地，前幾天自由印度臨時政府　斯主席的演講，各位巳經聽見，原來甘地曾建議盡力於中日友好，却為渝方所拒絕，原來大東亞戰爭發生以後，蔣介石夫　曾勸告尼格　如果印度能助英國抗日本，則他們將於大東亞戰爭後。向英國　旋使印度如澳洲及加拿大成為自治領，但是這種勸告，被尼格魯拒絕了，一來因為印度要成為獨立自主的國家，所謂自治領雖是英國的甘言，也決不能滿足印度人的志願，二來因為這種甘言，在上一次太戰巳聽過了，一個人一度被驅之後，決不願再度受騙，蔣介石夫婦於勸告無效之後，只得調動軍隊跟隨英國攻打糆甸·威嚇印度了，大奔敗績之後，如今又商量反攻，英國知　自巳所强迫募成的印度軍隊決不會向自由印度的軍隊作戰的，於是一味要渝方軍隊向自由印度的軍隊作戰，諸君想想·這不是東亞叛逆是什麽·試問中國有什麼理由向要求獨立自主的緬甸印度進攻·這在中國的歷史上是不能有此事實的，尤其在。國父提倡國民革命之後，無論從那一篇這那上，都找不出中國要跟隨英帝國主義者向着要求解放的亞洲同開進攻的理由來，反之「中國存亡問題」「大亞洲主義」，正丁寗反覆指出中國要聯合亞洲同胞向英美帝國主義要求解放，然則渝方為什麼要這樣的背這而馳呢！上頭說過，不為東亞同志便為來亞叛逆，再沒有徘徊的餘地，英美不是在說戰爭完途之後，也要以渝方為東方警察麼，這是說·戰爭中·固然要渝方做幫兇來殘殺緬名印度要求解放的同胞，即使戰爭後，也要渝方做幫兇來鎭壓住緬甸印度要求解放的同胞，使之永遠不能　身，諸君想想，中國能這樣做嗎，中國若這詎做，還成為中國嗎？</p>
<p>渝方廣播曲解</p>
<p>渝方近來廣播·我們也聽到一些，例如說：「自由印度我們是同情的，可是不能同情胞斯之接受日本援助」，試問為什麼鮑斯不能接受日本援助，難道這三萬萬多的印度同胞，只許英國加以壓制，加以凌虐，而絕不許有人路見不平，拔刀相助，况且印度的解放，固然為自己國家民族的獨立自主，同時也為東亞的共存共榮，印度的解放不只是印度的事·而且是整個亞洲，整個世界的事，何以日本不　加以援助，何以印度不能接受日本的　助，又如說，：「中日同盟條約等於空文，大東亞宣言從有共表」，中日同盟條約為什麼會成為空文，因為撤兵還沒有做到，撤兵為什麼還沒有做到，因為全面和平還沒有實現，全面和平為什麼還沒有實現，因為渝方依然高唱抗戰，甚至為英美而高唱抗戰，那麼使中日同盟條約等於空文的，共責任全在渝方，至於「大東亞宣言從有其表」，何以見介，例如英國在上次大戰時，對於印度獨立之諾言，食而不踐，這纔是虛有其表，又如美國威爾　在上次大戰時所宜佈的十四條，大戰後一條也沒有實踐，這綫是虛有共表，現在大東亞宣言各國正在共同奮斗，以期實現，何以見得虛有其表。</p>
<p>逐漸改善現實</p>
<p>兩三日來我在上海接見各方面的人士，似乎也有些人也為渝方宣傳所迷惑，以為中日同盟條約締結以後，現實避不是一樣，這些談話，自以為注重現實，而不知正是忽略事實，何以呢，現實不是驟然發生的，必須知道現實發生的原因，現實不能　然改變的，必須尋求改變現實的方法，不求原因不講方法，而徒知不得現實，因憤激而捶胸頓足，因悲歡而搖頭喪氣，這徒然躭　了探求原因研究方法的功夫，中日同盟條約，除了確定中日兩國相親信相共存共榮的原則之外，實行方法，在於　屬議定書及換文，附屬議定書的內容，是規定全面和平以後，立即撤兵，而且撤兵以後，不再有永久駐兵的特別約束，須知一切現實·都是由未撤兵而起的，有了附屬議定書的規定，則改造現實巳有方法了，換文的內容，是規定即使全面和平還未實現，也不至於無事可做，在可能的范圍內，逐漸改善加強國民政府的力量，以促進全面和平的到來，有了換文的規定，則全般了改造現實，雖尚有侍，而逐　改善，也有方法了，所以我們此時只要認定了中日同盟條約，是一個光明的方向，而努力求其達到。努力的方法，不外兩梯，其一是從種種方面，不斷努力，以達到全面和平，我們的方向，是光明的，渝方少數把持的人，無論如何冥頑，總不能隔斷全國同胞使之不能接近光明的方向，所以全面和平早晚必然達到，共二，是就可能範圍內，不斷努力，以期對於現實做一點一滴的改善，一切捶胸頓足搖頭喪氣的態度，都用不着，只有很小心的，同時很大胆的謀」點一滴的積累，論語「齊景公問政於孔子，孔子對曰，君君臣臣父父子子，景公曰善哉，信如君不君，臣不臣，父不父，子不子，雖有粟吾得而食諸」，如今師其意，士士農農工工商商，士盡其所以為士，　盡其所以為農，工盡其所以為工，商盡其所以為商，雖在金面和平尙未實現，全般現實尙未改造的期間，也能為人民解除多少痛苦，為國家培養多少力量，以上兩大努力的方法，値得我們以刻苦耐勞勇猛精進的精神，勉力做去，由此而現實漸漸改善，以至全般改造達到了光明的方向，即是中日兩國相親相信，共在共榮，大東亞各國相親相信，共存共榮，大東亞戰爭勝利，大東亞建設成功。（完）</p>

<p>— 溫桐</p>
<p>劉海粟作品展電會，是近四五年來上海藝壇的一個奇跡，中國藝境，甚至於整個東方藝壇的奇跡。因爲，劉氏在中國新興藝術　地中　是一個前無古人，後開來者的大家，他沒有動靜，別人儘管天天在展　，做運動，也就等於沒用的，何况，近四五年來，連沒用的人還沒有。</p>
<p>南洋倦　歸來，他帶問了很多的新鮮的活力，像椰子林中的火一般的太陽的熱力與美跑，到了上海，他仍是沉浸在繪畫的生活中，今日的畫展的　當的收　，那便是一個　好的瞪據。</p>
<p>他的作品，雖然有的是用油彩，有的是用水　，這是媒材的不同，在內容，有的是高山大川，有的是　風疾　。有的是猛虎　獅與　牛駿馬，可是他盡面上所給予人的盛覺。不是一片輕柔　細的優美，而是一種　快，雄　，豪放的力，縱宕不　，如果用藝術上的術語來解揮，那應該是表現主義吧。</p>
<p>或者有人　這樣我：　氏的繪盡，尤其像水　的作品，是不落畦經，不入玲趨，元氣淋　，　　權生，那應該　八到中國的文人畫，所　南宗的一流中去，然而在爪咔所製的「羣半圖」上，明明於骨　用筆，經營位置等一類國畫家所尊崇的六法之外，他又致力於陰陽向背，晦明遠近的空間感與立體　！那又明明是　　家所畢生努力的　實的枝法哩。</p>
<p>假　再面臨他的優化的作品，我們只看見一些綫條的飛　，色　的　積，只是一些重厚深廣的感　，如「椰林　海」　「鬥　」，「巴巴達仰火山」，東方盡家所　諸的筆勢，氣　等等，確又在　裏可以體會到的。</p>
<p>氏的藝術，是劉氏整個人格的表現，是東方民族精神的象　，這是從那　得來的呢？是由於「神俉力學」　，氏的　術是永恒的，是前進的。</p>

<p>— 流浪</p>
<p>海關行政律施對於本國國民——特別是商民方面——具有「利害相關，休戚與共」的關係。自從大東亞戰爭爆發以後，我國海關之本能，顯然有重大轉變．值茲濤關當局正在逐！謁　，銳意改進之時，我人站在商業　業員之立塲上，深　左列三問題，實有待於海關賢明當局的糾正與改。</p>
<p>廢除洋文</p>
<p>在過去，我國海翻實權，　　在侵略美美的魔手之中，用作對華經濟侵略榨取賀財的唯一工具，因此我國海關的一切殷施，在以便利英美爲最大準繩，所以海關一切文件單據，不管這文件單擴使用的對象是廣大的華八，也竟全以英文爲主體。自從大東亞展開　蕩英美　略的戰斗之後，海關　能，到目前顯已有劃時期的改觀，所以海關當局為了徹底掃除英美的侵略遺留物起見，是應立即洗刷這采用洋文為主體的污點才是，此後無論什麼穩健單據，一律廢除洋文，改用國文，藉以便利本國的工商各界，這是每一國民所翹首企盼者。</p>
<p>公佈章則</p>
<p>自大東亞戰爭發生以來，海關爲適應戰時體劃，對於物實之輸出與輸入，亦隨時有所變　，即在　　方面，也因基於應時劃宜的理由，亦大為變支，惟在目前海關對於章則之改更，往往海關主管部份　出一低小通吿外，並無使廣大民衆　通　知的公佈方式。（在戰前雖有時在報上刊怖廣吿，但也不一定完全刊佈廣吿。）近數年來，海關章則，已大事變動，因之人民對於納稅的稅率和手續，物資輸出的禁止或准許，以及關稅和轉口稅的交自多少數量始行征稅等問題，人民百分這九十九都茫然無知。所以海關當局，為謀推行關政，闡明關務，必須有一「情報科」之設立，對於一般章則的更變，應隨時由該科　送各報館公佈，此在第一區公署有「情報室」專司其事（即前工部局之情報室），如郵政管理局方面，對於敢章的變動，不論大小，逐一送交各報編輯部，即中國政府其他各機關，亦無不有此事任人員負責辦理，以海關與人民關係之密切，此項組織，乃屬必要。</p>
<p>厲行廉潔</p>
<p>海關在過去，對於關員之待遇，優於任何機關，因之海關戰員，所所謂「金飯碗」之美稱，蓋因海關關員，極為利用戰務而從事「私　」，　特輥以優厚之待遇，使之安心供戰，而另在關　方面，也特別嚴格元寶，如有蒙私舞弊者，立即停戰查辦。惟近年來，生活程度之急劇增高，關員待遇，亦已失去其重要生活之水準。因此我人　　海關當局，一方面應改　關員待遇，而一方面應立即整　外班，澈底防止「私弊」，勵行廉潔的美德。</p>

<p>— 求新</p>
<p>自從恐慌後，一般市民都感到燃料間題的日見嚴重，當局雖緊急予以　查，並　置，但直到現在，煤球的供應，還沒有納入正軌，而跟在煤球的後面，　柴售價目見商漲，也成了一個相當嚴重的問題。急盼當局能迅速予以注意，而採取必要的抑價步　。</p>
<p>主要的原因，就在煤球發生恐慌而後，一般購買不到煤球的人家，　法可想，就去買樹柴來燒飯。這無非是　宜之計　因爲用樹柴燒飯，既不經濟，又太麻煩，沒有煤球的便利。可是樹柴商人，就感到樹柴銷路日增，把樹柴的售價，拼　抬高。記得當煤球恐　沒有發生之前，樹柴　價已相當高貴，而煤球的市面一緊，　柴就迅連高　。不久出了大關　特別是小菜塲上的柴　，那是用樹柴　，也正在最貴起來</p>
<p>打小菜塲上出了兩元買一把柴　回來　很小的五六根，分量祇有幾兩重，完全用　　來燒，不必說，一天非燒去二三十元不可，就是煤球設法買到了，用柴　來生煤　，那　架很小的煤爐，也得至少用兩把　　，代價是四元。比之煤球，反而要貴，祇又豈是一般平民所能負擔得起？　　樹些的無限上漲，顯然是趁火打刼，是另一批奸商的作惡。所苦者當然是用戶，柴　已當金條賣，而且照目前的情形，漲風沒有止步，今後難保不再上漲。所以當局應從速出以有效的對策，把　柴商，來一個澈查，並實行限價。</p>
<p>否則的話，就是煤球問題　決，乃至實行農給，但先有煤球，不能生旺　子，非用柴　引火不可。我們總不能使生火的東四，反比煤球的本身消費為多，而不予限價，規定不得獲取照成本什一以上之利，那市民的燃料問題，還是脫不了嚴重性。所以數柴的澈查和限價，倒也未始不是一件迫不待緩的事。願當局為減輕市民壓迫，負擔起見，運出有效的對鐮加以制　才是。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Direction of Light <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Reading Chairman Wang's address, "The Direction of Light," to the various universities and high school youth groups in Shanghai, I feel that, standing from the standpoint of public opinion, there are many things that should be said. Although Chairman Wang has already clearly indicated what the "direction of light" is for the youth of China today, it seems that before embarking on this "direction of light," there are several questions that not only the youth themselves have not received correct answers to, but also the fathers and elder brothers of the youth have not received definite understanding of.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the youth of China today are in fact wandering on a diverging path. What is unfolding before them is not the "direction of light." Why? The most crucial reason, as Chairman Wang pointed out, is that "generally, the youth are dissatisfied with the current state of the country and society, especially in this era of existential crisis, the youth's state of mind is more than just dissatisfaction, I don't know how many times over." This truly strikes at the heart of the youth. However, besides this main reason, which is dissatisfaction with the current state, there are of course other reasons that prevent the youth from embarking on the "direction of light," which we should not ignore.</p>
<p>Currently, many youths are expressing dissatisfaction with the current state of the country and society due to their own living pressures, such as what Chairman Wang called "selfishness" and "despicable thoughts." However, judging from our usual contact with the majority of youths, especially college and high school students, this component seems to be relatively small, because the actual living pressures they experience are relatively lighter, so their dissatisfaction seems to "purely stem from public concerns." However, what we see in patriotic Japanese youth is completely different. When the government stopped deferring conscription for students of liberal arts, law, economics, and other subjects in order to strengthen the domestic wartime posture, tens of thousands of college students were passionate and excited, bidding farewell to their alma maters and families, and concentrating under the command of the state to go to the front lines of production! To go to the front lines of the decisive battle! How happy! May I ask: Why, being both East Asian youth and both motivated by patriotic fervor, do Chinese youth mostly feel dissatisfied with the status quo and get lost outside the "direction of light"? Whose responsibility is it? How should we strive to persuade and guide them? Besides the youth in schools, the youth in general society, or those who are already serving in society, can be said to be more lost in their "direction of light" and wandering on diverging paths, and therefore the situation is more serious. Although dissatisfaction with the status quo is the same, the motives and results are somewhat different. Some people are dissatisfied with the status quo due to living pressures and purely out of selfishness. However, may I ask: Why do youths experience living pressures? Or rather, youths should not be allowed to feel living pressures and express dissatisfaction with the status quo due to "despicable thoughts," but why do the youth not realize that their thoughts are despicable? Moreover, to be honest, among the youth in general society, those who know that they are dissatisfied with the status quo seem to be relatively more enlightened. What we fear most today is that there is another large group of youth who do not even have this feeling of "dissatisfaction," forgetting the fate of East Asia, forgetting the future of the country, forgetting the responsibility of society, and not even considering their own future, just "drinking today's wine today," going to dance halls every night, entering gambling dens every day, and even falling into depravity through extravagance and reckless behavior! May I ask again, to what extent is this phenomenon dangerous? Whose responsibility is it? How should we guide, help, and save them to face the "direction of light"?</p>
<p>The youth are the lifeblood of the country and the nation. The wandering of the vast youth outside the "direction of light," and even their falling into the trap of darkness and sin, is the supreme danger to the country, the nation, and even society. However, besides blaming our young friends, we dare to ask here: Have those who are parents and elder brothers today, those who are teachers and advanced individuals today, those who are social leaders today, and especially those who are government and education authorities today, already led by example and fulfilled their responsibilities to the youth of the country? Seeing the fact that Japanese elders happily send off their sons and brothers to the front lines, we cannot but feel that these few questions must be solemnly raised for discussion after reading Chairman Wang's address "The Direction of Light"!</p>
<h3 id="e2">In the Spirit of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, Seek Close Economic Cooperation: Advisor Ishiwatari Gives a Statement to Reporters <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, November 30th, Central News Agency: At the request of a Central News Agency reporter, Mr. Shotaro Ishiwatari, the Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, took time out of his busy schedule to meet with the reporter at his official residence at noon on the 30th. In light of the new progress in Sino-Japanese relations after the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, inquiries were made regarding the future economic relations between the two countries, the direction of the National Government's economic development, the adjustment of Sino-Japanese joint ventures, and his personal opinions on the National Government's implementation of economic control policies. He gave detailed replies as follows: (Question) What is the relationship between the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and economic cooperation? (Answer) After the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, the previously concluded Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty was completely abolished. The issue of economic cooperation between the two countries is clearly stated in the new treaty, pointing out that close economic cooperation between the two countries should be implemented based on mutual benefit. We should naturally strive to fully implement the spirit of the treaty and cooperate with each other. As for the issue of China's economic development, it should be promoted jointly by the Chinese government authorities and private individuals to achieve success. (Question) After the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, what are your views on the direction of the National Government's economic development? (Answer) The esteemed government of your country naturally has well-established policies regarding the direction of the National Government's economic development. However, in my observation, after the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance, China, in order to cooperate in completing the Great East Asia War, will of course implement a wartime economy and strive to increase production. Major sectors such as industry, mining, and agriculture should strive to increase production in order to help achieve victory. Therefore, the National Government's economic policies should focus on increasing production, while also paying attention to consumption savings and waste recycling. These two points are important ancillary issues in wartime production. In short, manpower, material resources, and financial resources are the most important conditions for achieving victory in the war. Other matters such as maintaining the stability of people's livelihoods during wartime are also important. The people should practice frugality and thrift under the wartime system. As a government advisor, I will provide as much opinion as possible if the National Government raises any questions for reference. (Question) What stage has the issue of adjusting Sino-Japanese joint ventures reached? (Answer) The issue of adjusting Sino-Japanese joint ventures, I think, refers to the issue of national policy companies. The so-called national policy companies are the state-owned enterprises referred to by Japan. Regarding the issue of adjusting these companies, China and Japan have been in contact for a long time. The Salt Industry Company has now been resolved, and the companies are generally in order, and other companies are also actively negotiating. The company issue has been a long-standing issue. This time, the dissolution of the branch companies is a manifestation of Japan's respect for China's sovereignty, and I have deep expectations for the future development of Silk Company. (Question) What are your views on the economic policies implemented by the National Government? And please, from a personal standpoint, comment on the National Government's implementation of economic control policies.) It is said that the focus is on increasing production, but the system is not good, and now the phenomenon is that it is difficult to purchase raw materials. Now, in the face of the war, the question of how to "distribute" and how to "consume" the resources under the National Government's control is still unresolved. In the past, it was a free-market economy. Now that it has switched to a controlled economy, difficulties have naturally arisen. Regarding the specific measures for the National Government's implementation of economic control policies, the General Association for Commercial Control has been established, and the procurement and allocation of materials are implemented with this as the main body. At the same time, the National Government respects the opinions of the people and recruits powerful individuals to promote it. From the current point of view, it has achieved considerable results. As for the reason why the National Government's economy could not develop soundly in the past, it was actually due to the existence of concessions in Shanghai. Now that the concessions have been recovered, and powerful individuals from the people are cooperating with the government, this is not only a congratulation for the future of the National Government's economic policies, but also a congratulation for the entire future of China.</p>

<p>Nanjing, November 30th, Central News Agency: The Japanese Conference of Ambassadors and Consuls to China continued to meet at the embassy at 9:00 a.m. on the 3rd.

<p>Mr. Yamamoto's Talk</p>
<p>Nanjing, November 30th, Central News Agency: After the conclusion of the Conference of Japanese Ambassadors and Consuls to China on the 30th, Vice Minister of the Greater East Asia Ministry Yamamoto met with the press corps to explain the future Sino-Japanese relations, stating: "The convening of this conference of ambassadors and consuls is extremely timely and has yielded great results. We have also studied future strategies to adapt to the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. It is expected that the promotion of policies towards China will definitely be smoother in the future. Whether it is the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, or even China and Japan, and even the Greater East Asia, they are all based on the fundamental spirit of so-called 'flesh and blood brothers.' Once Japan makes a promise, it will definitely be put into practice. There is no room for doubt about Japan's international integrity. Therefore, the Japanese residents in China and the central and local military and civilians unanimously understand this spirit. The current prices in China, as well as the financial and economic problems, are unavoidable in any country in the world today. Because they are related to other issues, they must be understood comprehensively. China's interests and the interests of Greater East Asia, so we should proceed with this determination, with China and Japan cooperating."</p>

<h3 id="e4">Japanese Army Announces October War Results <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, November 30th, Central News Agency: The Japanese Dispatch Army to China announced the comprehensive war results for October as follows: The results of ground troops' battles: the number of engagements was 1,705 times, the Chongqing army's engaged forces were 157,007 people, 18,999 Chongqing soldiers were killed in action, 5,700 were captured and surrendered, the main seized items included various cannons 34, the same number of shells 4,787, heavy and light machine guns 239, the same number of ammunition 66,710, rifles and automatic rifles 9,470, the same number of ammunition 1,170,571, pistols 1,264, the same number of ammunition 232, again 798 medicines, hand grenades 91,516, bayonets, etc. 855, horses 1,289, land mines 5,495, other wireless electric enemy aircraft 13 aircraft were destroyed, The losses of the Japanese army: 577 killed in action, 3 aircraft self-detonated and did not return. Regarding the above comprehensive war results, the number of prisoners and surrenders of the Chongqing army is even greater than the number of deaths. The number of artillery and heavy and light machine guns among the seized weapons has decreased, while the number of individual soldier weapons such as rifles, hand grenades, and land mines has increased sharply. This is enough to show the decline in the Chongqing side's will to resist and the weakness of its production capacity.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Japanese Expeditionary Force Announces Situation in Western Hunan <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, November 30th, Central News Agency: The Japanese China Expeditionary Force reported at 12:00 noon on the 30th: Since our army began operations against the 6th War Zone of the Chongqing army in the northwest of Dongting Lake, it has been two months, thoroughly defeating the Chongqing Central Army's strength of approximately 100,000 troops. The enemy army recently had about one division stationed at the important stronghold of Changde, and since our army began attacking the area on November 26, we have now captured the city gates and walls and are sweeping away the remaining enemies in the urban area. Our army's air force and ground troops are closely cooperating and have achieved great results.</p>
<p>Another telegram stated that since the Japanese army broke through the outer defenses of Changde, they are now advancing rapidly towards Changde. Among them, a certain unit of the Japanese army advancing from the south seized more than 500 Chongqing army boats near the port (5 kilometers south of Changde) on the 22nd, and as a result, the Chongqing army's boat activities in that area have been completely blocked. Another Japanese army advancing into the southern area of Lingxian County seized 70 fully loaded military transport ships near Lingxian (12 kilometers south of Lingxian County) on the 21st and 22nd, containing military supplies totaling thousands of tons, including weapons, ammunition, clothing, and food sufficient for one or even two divisions. In addition to this, a large number of artillery attacks were carried out on the Longyang military facilities, resulting in severe explosions. Another telegram stated that Xue Yue, commander of the 9th War Zone of Chongqing, urgently requested assistance in Changde, and the 10th, 197th, 74th, and 3rd divisions of his troops attempted to launch a surprise attack on the Japanese army advancing on Changde. Knowing this, on the morning of November 27, they launched a surprise attack on the 197th Division in Ercong Port (25 kilometers southeast of Changde). The division was attacked at Huanglinggang (14.8 kilometers southwest of Longyang), and it was completely wiped out by the evening. At the same time, another unit launched a surprise attack on the 12th Reserve Division of the 4th Military Region (near Changde), and annihilated it, thwarting Chongqing's attempt to rescue Changde.</p>
<p>Central News Agency telegram on this day: The Japanese army air force has been responding to the ground troops and continuing to attack Changde for days. On the morning of the 29th, a large formation of fighter-bombers attacked the area again at around 10:00 a.m. At that time, a combined US-Chongqing air force of 45 P40 and P43 aircraft engaged the Japanese aircraft formation at an altitude of 1,000 meters. The Japanese fighter aircraft immediately attacked them, and a fierce air battle unfolded over Changde. One P43 aircraft was shot down, and at the same time, the bomber formation bombed military facilities in the city, inflicting heavy damage and shooting down one enemy P43 aircraft.</p>
<p>Lisbon, November 30th, Central News Agency: According to a Chongqing telegram, the Chongqing Military Commission announced the battle situation on the 28th as follows: Since the evening of the 25th, the Japanese army has launched fierce attacks on the Ximen and Nanmen of Changde, engaging in a heroic bayonet battle with the Chongqing army. The Japanese artillery also launched a fierce concentrated bombardment of the Chongqing army's positions inside and outside Changde County.</p>

<h3 id="e8">Japanese Aircraft Bombs Makin Island, Sinks Three Enemy Ships: Heavy Blow to Enemy's Counterattack Plan <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, November 30th, Central News Agency: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 p.m. on the 30th: On the evening of the 28th, the Imperial Navy Air Force attacked an enemy transport fleet anchored in the lagoon of Makin Island, achieving the following results: One large cruiser sunk, one large cruiser destroyed (heavily damaged and on fire), one transport ship (heavily damaged and on fire). Our side suffered no damage.</p>
<p>Tokyo, November 30th, Central News Agency: Military experts here have commented on the US military's landing operation on the Gilbert Islands as follows: Judging from the results announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, the enemy fleet assembled in the Gilbert Islands must be a large joint fleet with a dozen aircraft carriers and dozens of battleships, cruisers, and destroyers. The enemy's naval power in the Pacific must have been deployed there. The transport fleet escorted by this large fleet carried landing forces that were about ten times the size of the Japanese forces in the Gilbert Islands. The enemy army launched such a large fleet to attack the central Pacific because their attack on Bougainville in the southwestern Pacific was met with strong Japanese defenses and counterattacks, resulting in heavy losses, and their attempt to capture Rabaul failed.</p>
<p>The Japanese Army Strengthens Its Strength and Engages in Interior Line Operations</p>
<p>In order to carry out a pincer attack simultaneously, they must move their base forward from the Ellice Islands in the central Pacific, so as to attack the Japanese-held Truk Island in a coordinated manner. Because they feared encountering the main Japanese fleet, they did not hesitate to deploy a large fleet and a large number of troops to attack. Their extreme fear can be seen from the state of the enemy ships. Since the enemy army landed on Makin Island and Tarawa Island, they have not only suffered casualties of 7,000 to 8,000 soldiers, but also lost two-thirds of their aircraft carriers and many cruisers and destroyers. The enemy army suffered repeated defeats on Bougainville before, and this time they did not hesitate to make great sacrifices to recapture small isolated islands in the Pacific, which proves that their counterattack skills are exhausted. Since the Japanese army's retreat from Guadalcanal, they have been engaged in interior line operations for more than a year, working hard to increase their strength and break the enemy's counterattack, which is the best strategy. It can be seen that their strategic goals will soon be achieved.</p>

<p>Shonan, November 30th, Central News Agency: The Japanese Army Air Force in Burma attacked the enemy forward bases of Feni and Agartala in eastern India on the 28th and 29th, destroying nine enemy aircraft on the airfield (including five large aircraft). Enemy aircraft were observed to be on fire and burning. They also engaged enemy fighters that intercepted them, instantly shooting down five enemy aircraft. The Japanese aircraft lost two aircraft in this operation.</p>
<p>Lisbon, November 30th, Central News Agency: According to a New Delhi telegram: Japanese air force units bombed anti-Axis positions in eastern Bengal Province, India, on the morning of the 28th.</p>
<p>Shonan, November 30th, Central News Agency: On the 26th, the Japanese Army Air Force used a combined formation of fighters and bombers to bombard enemy positions near Finschhafen, New Guinea Island, inflicting heavy damage on enemy artillery positions west of Cape Anders and enemy artillery positions south of Harpur Harbor, with three locations on fire. The Japanese fighter force also engaged 20 enemy fighters in the skies above the area and on the return journey, shooting down two P-40 aircraft. The Japanese aircraft also had three self-detonated and unreturned aircraft.</p>

The people have suffered from the bombing of the anti-Axis air force, and now they wish to express the greatest respect for the brave and combative Japanese people with the same determination as Japan. Because the Japanese army achieved the results this time, the damage to the US fleet will be even greater.

<p>Guangzhou, 30th (Central News Agency) Since the issuance of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration and the resolution of various East Asian countries to fully support the Indian independence movement, the Indian independence movement has become more active and entered the practical stage. Mr. Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, recently met with a group of reporters in Shonan and stated that a part of the Indian army has begun to advance towards the Indian-Burmese border. Upon hearing this, the overseas Indians in various parts of East Asia were greatly excited and competed to join the cause, striving for the freedom and independence of their motherland.

<p>The Revival of Nationalism</p>
<p>(Continued from yesterday) As mentioned above, around the time of the founding of the Republic, nationalism was not fully realized. Around the 1920s, it simply abandoned nationalism. The general youth were hesitant and unclear about the direction of light, not only distressed but also wasted a lot of effort. Now, nationalism has revived, not only revived but also become sound. The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Declaration detail that each nation in East Asia obtains independence and autonomy while striving for coexistence and co-prosperity. In short, the four characters "East Asian Nation" can include this, without neglecting the independence of each or ignoring the commonality of each. Why only say East Asia and not the world? Because the entire world is about to be swallowed by Britain and the United States, and all that remains is East Asia. Gather the nations of East Asia and fight together to prevent being swallowed by Britain. Further, take out all the others that have been swallowed from the mouths of Britain and the United States. Therefore, East Asianism is truly worldism. In this way, the direction of light changes from hesitation to firmness and from vagueness to clarity. The so-called epoch-making era has real meaning in this.</p>
<p>Dissatisfaction with one's own country and society can arise from contempt or from deep love and concern. The former will abandon one's own country and society, but the latter will not. As long as a direction for saving the country and saving society is found, one will surely be able to muster the courage to move forward. Although the future is obstructed, just as there are thorns on land and waves on the sea, this is not unexpected; it is expected. As long as you muster the courage to keep moving forward, you will surely be able to remove these obstacles with a spirit of hard work, endurance, and courage.</p>
<p>No More Room for Hesitation</p>
<p>Young friends, in this era, the only direction we can take is this one, because in this era, if you are not an East Asian comrade, you are an East Asian traitor. There is no more room for hesitation. A few days ago, you heard the speech of Chairman Bose of the Provisional Government of Free India. Originally, Gandhi had suggested trying to be friendly with China and Japan, but was rejected by the Chongqing side. Originally, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Chiang Kai-shek and his wife advised Nehru that if India could help Britain resist Japan, then after the Greater East Asia War, they would lobby Britain to make India an autonomous dominion like Australia and Canada. However, this advice was rejected by Nehru. First, because India wanted to become an independent and autonomous country, the so-called dominion, although sweet words from Britain, could not satisfy the aspirations of the Indian people. Second, because these sweet words had already been heard in the last world war. A person who has been deceived once will never want to be deceived again. After Chiang Kai-shek and his wife's advice was ineffective, they had to mobilize troops to follow Britain to attack Burma and threaten India. After the great defeat, they are now discussing a counterattack. Britain knows that the Indian army that it forcibly recruited will never fight against the army of Free India. Therefore, it insists that the Chongqing army fight against the army of Free India. Friends, think about it, what is this if it is not an East Asian traitor? May I ask, what reason does China have to attack Burma and India, which are demanding independence and autonomy? This cannot be a fact in Chinese history, especially after Dr. Sun Yat-sen advocated the National Revolution. No matter which article you read, you cannot find any reason for China to follow the British imperialists to attack Asian compatriots who are demanding liberation. On the contrary, "The Problem of China's Survival" and "Pan-Asianism" repeatedly point out that China should unite with Asian compatriots to demand liberation from British and American imperialism. Then why does Chongqing want to go against this? As mentioned above, if you are not an East Asian comrade, you are an East Asian traitor. There is no more room for hesitation. Aren't Britain and the United States saying that after the war is over, they will make Chongqing the Eastern Police? This means that during the war, they want Chongqing to be an accomplice to slaughter Burmese and Indian compatriots who are demanding liberation. Even after the war, they want Chongqing to be an accomplice to suppress Burmese and Indian compatriots who are demanding liberation, so that they can never stand up. Friends, think about it, can China do this? If China does this, will it still be China?</p>
<p>Chongqing Distorts Broadcasts</p>
<p>We have also heard some of Chongqing's recent broadcasts, for example, saying: "We sympathize with Free India, but we cannot sympathize with Bose's acceptance of Japanese aid." May I ask, why can't Bose accept Japanese aid? Is it only permissible for Britain to suppress and abuse these 300 million-plus Indian compatriots, and is it absolutely impermissible for anyone to see injustice and draw a sword to help? Moreover, the liberation of India is not only for the independence and autonomy of their own nation, but also for the coexistence and co-prosperity of East Asia. The liberation of India is not just a matter for India, but a matter for the entire Asia and the entire world. Why can't Japan help them? Why can't India accept Japanese aid? It is also said, "The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty is equivalent to a dead letter, and the Greater East Asia Declaration has only a formal appearance." Why has the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty become a dead letter? Because the withdrawal of troops has not yet been achieved. Why has the withdrawal of troops not yet been achieved? Because overall peace has not yet been achieved. Why has overall peace not yet been achieved? Because Chongqing is still singing the song of resistance, even singing the song of resistance for Britain and the United States. Then the responsibility for making the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty a dead letter lies entirely with Chongqing. As for "the Greater East Asia Declaration has only a formal appearance," what is the evidence? For example, Britain broke its promise of independence to India during the last world war. That is only a formal appearance. Also, the fourteen points announced by US President Wilson during the last world war were not implemented after the war. That is only a formal appearance. Now, the countries of the Greater East Asia Declaration are working together to achieve it. How can it be said that it has only a formal appearance?</p>
<p>Gradually Improving Reality</p>
<p>In the past two or three days, I have met with people from all walks of life in Shanghai, and it seems that some people have also been deceived by Chongqing's propaganda, thinking that after the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, reality is still the same. These talks think they are paying attention to reality, but they do not know that they are ignoring the facts. Why? Reality does not happen suddenly. You must know the reasons why reality happens. Reality cannot be changed suddenly. You must seek ways to change reality. If you do not seek reasons or talk about methods, but only know that you cannot get reality, you will only waste time on exploring reasons and researching methods by stamping your feet and shaking your heads in anger and despair. Besides establishing the principles of mutual trust, mutual help, coexistence and coprosperity between China and Japan, the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty has specific methods for practice, which lie in the attached protocols and exchange of documents. The content of the attached protocols is to stipulate that troops will be withdrawn immediately after overall peace is achieved, and that there will be no special restrictions on permanent stationing of troops after the withdrawal. It must be known that all reality arises from the non-withdrawal of troops. With the provisions of the attached protocols, there is already a way to transform reality. The content of the exchange of documents is to stipulate that even if overall peace has not yet been achieved, it is not as if nothing can be done. To gradually improve and strengthen the strength of the National Government within the possible scope, in order to promote the arrival of overall peace. With the provisions of the exchange of documents, although the overall transformation of reality is still awaited, there is also a way to gradually improve. Therefore, at this time, we only need to recognize that the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty is a bright direction and strive to achieve it. The methods of effort are nothing more than two paths. One is to constantly strive in all aspects to achieve overall peace. Our direction is bright. No matter how stubborn the few people in power in Chongqing are, they cannot separate the compatriots of the whole country and prevent them from approaching the bright direction, so overall peace will inevitably be achieved sooner or later. The second is to constantly strive within the possible scope to gradually improve reality little by little. All attitudes of stamping your feet and shaking your heads are unnecessary. Only very careful, and at the same time very bold, plans to accumulate little by little are needed. The Analects say, "Duke Jing of Qi asked Confucius about government. Confucius replied, 'Let the ruler be a ruler, the minister be a minister, the father be a father, and the son be a son.' Duke Jing said, 'Excellent! Indeed, if the ruler is not a ruler, the minister is not a minister, the father is not a father, and the son is not a son, although there is grain, how can I eat it?'" Now learn from its meaning, let scholars be scholars, farmers be farmers, workers be workers, and merchants be merchants. Let scholars fulfill their duties as scholars, farmers fulfill their duties as farmers, workers fulfill their duties as workers, and merchants fulfill their duties as merchants. Even during the period when overall peace has not yet been achieved and the overall reality has not yet been transformed, it can relieve the people of some suffering and cultivate some strength for the country. The above two major methods of effort are worthy of our effort with a spirit of hard work, endurance, courage, and diligence. From this, the reality will gradually improve, until the overall transformation reaches the bright direction, which is the mutual trust and mutual help between China and Japan, the mutual trust and mutual help, coexistence and coprosperity of the countries of Greater East Asia, the victory of the Greater East Asia War, and the success of Greater East Asia construction.

<h3 id="e24">Bran Distribution Office Officially Established Today, Handling Bran Allocation in Shanghai Area <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) The Flour and Bran Special Committee of the Business Coordination Association, in order to expand the source of supply and rationalize the allocation system, for the allocation of bran in the Shanghai area, the Shanghai Flour Industry Association specially appointed representatives in accordance with the plan, and negotiated with representatives of the Japanese Shanghai Wheat Flour Control and Distribution Association, and decided that the "Shanghai Area Flour and Bran Distribution Office" jointly established by the Chinese and Japanese industries would be responsible for the allocation of bran to Chinese and Japanese merchants in the Shanghai area. Representatives from both sides were appointed to jointly prepare, and the organization was established on November 15. All Japanese Shanghai Wheat Flour Control Association and Distribution Association have ended and handed over to the Distribution Office, which has been completed. Starting today (1st), the task of bran allocation will begin. According to the Central News Agency reporter, the bran allocation method will be temporarily divided into household registration allocation and special needs allocation.</p>
<p>Household Allocation Issues Purchase Certificates</p>
<p>The steps and procedures for flour allocation include: For household registration allocation, purchase certificates will first be issued to households in the first and eighth districts, as well as in the "South Shanghai", "Zhabei", "West Shanghai", and "Southeast Pudong" areas, with the retail store number marked on them, and purchases will be made with the certificates. After the processing is completed, it will gradually be promoted to Nanhui, Chuansha, Baoshan, Chongming and other districts.</p>
<p>Special Allocations Divided into Three Categories</p>
<p>The method for special flour allocation is divided into three categories: food raw materials, industrial needs, and group needs. For food raw material allocation, the industry association will issue a list of members and the amount of flour needed, with the seal attached, and send it to the Distribution Office for review and decision, and issue a special flour purchase certificate. The industry association will then distribute the certificate to its members, who will pick it up at the designated distribution point. For the allocation of industrial needs, the industry association will apply for the required quantity, and the Distribution Office will directly allocate it after review and decision. For the allocation of group needs, the group will send a written application to the Distribution Office, and after reviewing the situation, it will be submitted to the authorities for approval before allocation.</p>
<p>Retail Distribution Limited to Association Members</p>
<p>The Distribution Office stipulates that the retail distributors and distribution points that handle the flour will be limited to retail association members of the Flour Association in each district. However, Japanese retailers will form their own distribution points to handle the allocation of supplies to Japanese merchants. The quantity, price, and distribution of flour allocated to each distribution point will be submitted by the office to the Flour and Wheat Special Committee for approval.</p>
<p>Allocated Flour Is Prohibited from Resale</p>
<p>All allocated flour may not be resold. The office may send personnel to conduct on-site investigations of any industry that receives allocated flour at any time. If any discrepancies are found, the allocation to the entire association may be suspended or the quantity reduced. It is said that the office will set up eight temporary distribution points starting today to handle the special allocation needs in the urban area.</p>
<p>Allocation of Bran to Livestock Farms</p>
<p>For farms that raise livestock in this area, if their association applies to the Distribution Office for bran allocation, they must first declare the number of heads of livestock and make clear the type, and an appropriate allocation will be made after verification.</p>

The company issued a notice yesterday: Electricity: Electricity users must not exceed 65% of their current electricity consumption from the 1st. Violations will be fined or the current supply will be cut off. Water: Water usage must not exceed 60% of the usual amount in summer (July, August, September), otherwise a penalty of 20 times the current price will be imposed or the water supply will be cut off. The company also hopes that each user will refer to the electricity bills of August, September, and thirteenth months and the water bills of July, August, and September, and pay attention to the highest usage among them, so as not to exceed the regulations and be subject to penalties.</p>

<p>— Wen Tong</p>
<p>The Liu Haisu exhibition is a miracle in the Shanghai art scene in the past four or five years, and even a miracle in the entire Eastern art scene. Because Liu is a master who has no predecessors and opens the way for future generations in the Chinese emerging art world. If he doesn't make a move, no matter how much others exhibit and exercise every day, it's useless. What's more, even useless people haven't appeared in the past four or five years.</p>
<p>Returning from his journey in Southeast Asia, he brought back a lot of fresh vitality, like the heat and beauty of the sun like fire in a coconut grove. When he arrived in Shanghai, he was still immersed in the life of painting. The considerable success of today's exhibition is good evidence.</p>
<p>Although some of his works use oil paint and some use watercolor, these are different media. In terms of content, some are high mountains and great rivers, and some are rushing winds and swift rain. Some are fierce tigers, lions, cattle, and steeds, but the overall feeling he gives people is not a gentle and delicate beauty, but a kind of hearty, majestic, and unrestrained force, unrestrained and uninhibited. If we use artistic terms to explain it, it should be expressionism.</p>
<p>Or someone may say to me: Mr. Liu's paintings, especially his watercolor works, are not bound by convention or trend, and are full of vitality and spontaneity. Shouldn't they be attributed to the first-class Southern School of Chinese literati painting? However, in the "Group of Half-Body Figures" made in Java, in addition to the six principles respected by traditional Chinese painters, such as bone method with the brush and management of position, he also devoted himself to the sense of space and three-dimensionality of light and dark, backlighting, and distance! Isn't that what Western painters strive for all their lives?</p>
<p>If we look at his excellent works again, we only see some flying lines, accumulations of colors, and only some heavy, profound, and broad feelings, such as "Coconut Grove by the Sea", "Fighting Bull", and "Mount Babadayang Volcano". The brushstrokes, momentum, etc. that Eastern painters pursue can indeed be experienced here.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu's art is a manifestation of his entire personality, and an symbol of the spirit of the Eastern nation. Where does this come from? It is due to "God-given Strength". Mr. Liu's art is eternal and progressive.</p>

<h3 id="e38">Commentary: Factories Resume Production <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>With China's original backward industry, coupled with the losses in the war, it is no wonder that factories have been silent for the past few years. Recently, various authorities in the city have ordered large and small factories in various industries to resume production by a deadline and to report a summary table as a basis for future allocation of raw materials. After receiving the order, the factories happily selected personnel to fill in the forms and report truthfully, and recruited male and female workers to actively prepare for resumption of work. It is also learned that in order to enable factories in various industries to significantly expand production, the authorities have coordinated with relevant parties to transport a large amount of raw materials to Shanghai for timely allocation. This measure is naturally good news for the production sector.</p>
<p>The public has long suffered from commodity shortages and has been oppressed to the point of suffocation. Ultimately, the main reason is the lack of materials. Only by balancing the supply and demand of materials can this serious phenomenon be gradually reduced. Therefore, the most fundamental issue today is to increase production across the board, and the main tasks in resuming production can be summarized as follows: 1. The coordination and allocation of raw materials must be smooth and sufficient. 2. The transportation and sales of products must have a common goal. 3. Production funds must be jointly facilitated by the banking industry. 4. The young and strong members of the unemployed population, especially unemployed technical personnel, must be recruited and accommodated as much as possible to become a powerful force in production. Therefore, in terms of resuming the production of various factories, the efficiency and results of production can be maintained at a horizontal level, and the phenomenon of countless unemployed people caused by the shutdown of industry and commerce in the past can also be eliminated or reduced from now on. Isn't this a sign of a healthy wartime economy?</p>

<p>The Silver and Money Industries Association recently received a letter from the Meihang Bank stating: "Enlightenment: We have recently received Instruction No. 492 from the Ministry of Finance stating, 'Regarding the promotion of Central Reserve Certificates, the Ministry has been proceeding according to the original plan for years. Now, Central Reserve Bank Certificates in Central and Southern China have become the only currency. However, since the administrative adjustment of the Suhuai Special District, all currencies have been based on payment habits and the property of the general public. The scope of its implementation still uses the China United Reserve Bank Certificates. In terms of financial flow, it is actually an adjustment. There is no influence. In order to implement the monetary policy, the current currency system of the Suhuai Special District is adjusted according to the following methods.</p>
<p>Appropriate Adjustments</p>
<p>From December 1, 1983, the currency of the Suhuai Special District will be the Central Reserve Bank Certificates and China United Reserve Bank Certificates. When there is considerable success, the new issuance of China United Reserve Bank Certificates in the area will be stopped. Refer to the local situation and implement it on a regular basis for a comprehensive exchange, so that Central Reserve Bank Certificates will be the only currency. The exchange rate between Central Reserve Bank Certificates and China United Reserve Bank Certificates will still be 100 Central Reserve Certificates to 18 Union Bank Certificates. All public funds in the Suhuai Special District will also be paid and received in Central Reserve Bank Certificates from now on. The monetary system in North and Central China will not be fundamentally changed due to this measure. The original measures for Suhuai's agricultural products in North China will not be affected by this. Based on the above measures, the exchange of materials between Suhuai and other regions will definitely become more convenient. This matter concerns the adjustment of currency. In addition to reporting well to the branch offices, we are instructed to inform the guild and transfer it to all member banks and firms. We hope you will check and comply.'"</p>

<h3 id="e47">Three Hopes for Customs <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Wandering</p>
<p>The implementation of customs administrative laws has a relationship of "close relationship and common destiny" for domestic citizens - especially merchants. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the function of our customs has obviously undergone major changes. At a time when the customs authorities are taking steps to improve, we, standing on the position of commercial employees, deeply feel that the following three issues need to be corrected and changed by the wise authorities of the customs.</p>
<p>Abolish Foreign Languages</p>
<p>In the past, the real power of our customs was in the hands of the aggressive beauty of the United States, which was used as the only tool for economic aggression and extortion of wealth against China. Therefore, all of our customs' applications were based on facilitating the United States and the United Kingdom as the greatest standard. Therefore, all documents and receipts of the customs, regardless of whether the target of these documents and receipts was the vast majority of Chinese, were all based on English. Since the Greater East Asia launched a war against the aggression of the United States and the United Kingdom, the customs' function has obviously undergone a watershed change. Therefore, in order to completely eliminate the legacy of aggression by the United States and the United Kingdom, the customs authorities should immediately wash away the stain of using foreign languages as the main body. From now on, no matter what stable documents and receipts, all foreign languages should be abolished and replaced with Chinese, so as to facilitate the industrial and commercial circles of this country. This is what every citizen is looking forward to.</p>
<p>Promulgate Regulations</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the customs has also made changes to the export and import of materials in order to adapt to the wartime system. Even in terms of , there have been major changes due to the reasons of timely planning. However, at present, the customs' changes to the regulations are often just a small announcement issued by the customs' competent department, and there is no way to publicize the notice to the vast majority of the public. (Before the war, advertisements were sometimes published in newspapers, but not all advertisements were necessarily published.) In recent years, the customs regulations have undergone major changes. As a result, 99% of the people are ignorant of the tax rates and procedures for paying taxes, the prohibition or permission of material exports, and the amount of customs duties and transit taxes that are subject to taxation. Therefore, in order to promote customs administration and clarify customs affairs, the customs authorities must establish an "Information Section," and the changes to general regulations should be sent to newspapers for publication by the section at any time. The First District Public Office has an "Information Office" dedicated to this matter (i.e., the former Intelligence Office of the Public Works Department). For example, the Postal Administration sends all changes to regulations, regardless of size, to the editorial departments of newspapers one by one. Even other agencies of the Chinese government have personnel responsible for handling this matter. Given the close relationship between customs and the people, this organization is necessary.</p>
<p>Implement Integrity</p>
<p>In the past, the customs' treatment of customs officers was better than that of any other agency. As a result, customs soldiers were referred to as "golden rice bowls." This was because customs officers made great use of warfare to engage in "private," and especially gave generous treatment to make them feel at ease to fight, while also strictly forbidding any private malpractice. However, in recent years, the rapid increase in the cost of living has also caused the treatment of customs officers to lose its important standard of living. Therefore, we urge the customs authorities to change the treatment of customs officers on the one hand, and to immediately reorganize the outer classes and thoroughly prevent "private malpractice" and promote the virtue of integrity on the other hand.</p>

There are quite a few people who have come to the association to apply for issuance. In order to issue winter clothes carefully, the association has printed the "Application Form for Winter Clothing." Children who need winter clothes can quickly go to the association (208, Zhongjiu Building, 208, Aiduya Road) to pick up the form, clearly state the applicant's name, address, family situation, and the child's age and name, etc., and obtain a guarantee from a proper vocational person or shop. After the association sends someone to investigate and verify the facts, the winter clothing will be issued. According to Chief Secretary Ding Bingnan, the climate in this city will soon turn into severe winter, and the poor children urgently need clothing. He hopes that all sectors will help.</p>

Feeling sorry that the children have nothing to eat, his friends are unable to help and instead of helping him, they are calling on people to buy the paintings of Qian and his former teachers collected over the years, at a price of one-fifth of the normal price, for the benefit of all those who share the same hobbies. All the money obtained will be given to Qian for his livelihood. Who will take pity on this poor uncle? The ancient pavilion is sincerely invited to assist in raising funds for the paintings. Qian is the head of a large and poor family, and helping him is an act of immense virtue. The address for viewing the paintings is Rui Hongchu, Kangzhuang, Ningbo Road, Shilu.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Urgently Suppress the Rise in Firewood Prices <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Xin</p>
<p>Since the panic, the general public has felt that the fuel problem is becoming increasingly serious. Although the authorities have urgently investigated and responded, the supply of briquettes has not yet returned to normal. Following the briquettes, the price of firewood has also risen sharply, which has become a rather serious problem. It is urgently hoped that the authorities can quickly pay attention to this and take the necessary steps to suppress the price.</p>
<p>The main reason is that after the briquette panic, people who could not buy briquettes had no other choice but to buy firewood for cooking. This is nothing more than an expedient measure, because using firewood for cooking is not economical and too troublesome compared to the convenience of briquettes. However, firewood merchants felt that firewood sales were increasing, so they desperately raised the price of firewood. I remember that before the briquette panic occurred, the price of firewood was already quite high. Once the supply of briquettes became tight, the price of firewood rose rapidly. Recently, there have been large price increases, especially the firewood sold in the small vegetable markets, which is used for heating. This firewood is becoming increasingly expensive.</p>
<p>Buying a bundle of firewood for two yuan from the vegetable market only yields five or six very small pieces, weighing only a few ounces. If one relies entirely on firewood for cooking, it is unnecessary to say that twenty or thirty yuan must be spent every day. Even if one manages to buy briquettes, using firewood to light the briquettes in a small stove requires at least two bundles of firewood, costing four yuan. This is more expensive than using briquettes, which ordinary people cannot afford. The unlimited increase in the price of firewood is clearly profiteering, another act of wrongdoing by unscrupulous merchants. The sufferers are, of course, the consumers. Firewood is being sold at the price of gold bars, and in the current situation, the rising trend shows no sign of stopping, and further increases are likely. Therefore, the authorities should quickly come up with effective countermeasures, thoroughly investigate the firewood merchants, and implement price controls.</p>
<p>Otherwise, even if the briquette problem is solved, and even if rationing is implemented, briquettes cannot be ignited without using firewood. We cannot allow the cost of kindling to exceed the cost of the briquettes themselves without implementing price controls and stipulating that profits should not exceed 10% of the cost. In that case, the public's fuel problem will remain serious. Therefore, a thorough investigation and price control of firewood is also an urgent matter. It is hoped that the authorities, in order to alleviate the public's oppression and financial burden, will come up with effective countermeasures and implement controls.</p>
