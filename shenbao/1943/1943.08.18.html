<p>社評</p>
<h3>展開收買紗布工作</h3>
<p>自從國民政府明令收買上海現存棉紗棉布，責成全國商業統制總會全權辦理收購事務以後，各方面對此問題，莫不加以密切注視，誠如日本朝日新聞社評（見本日譯論）所云：「對當前最大難關的復興經濟，安定民生問題，踏上了解決的第一步。」因為這一措置，如果澈底做到，並進一步實踐合理配給，那末，一部分民生得以安定，中國經濟的復興，自然可以蘄致了。反之，如果不能澈底做到，不能實踐合理配給，那末，共結果對於安定民生，復與經濟，自然也無從蘄致了。朝日新聞社評又說：「萬一收買的物资不能有效地使用，則挽救中國的經濟，將陷於困難，是以有效適切的使用，不能不期其特別愼重。」完全與我們，也可說是大部分中國入民共同的感覺。</p>
<p>「從作戰利益的觀點而言，似乎日水不能無條件委棄，但日本在推行對華新政策的大前提下，這些微末問題，如果一一加以唯利觀念的干涉，那是錯誤的。」朝日新聞更說明了友邦對此措置的坦白的旨趣，因而對於國民政府的期待也就格外的嚴切了。</p>
<p>我們再看谷大使於國府公布命令以後發表的聲明，充分表示協力贊助，並對日本商民所有紗布同樣收買，俾與我們的措置配合。現在日本方面已由華中貿易聯合會設立臨時紗布管理事務局辦理收買事務，實施收買規程也已由日大使館上海事務所核准施行。所以，日本方面的收購工作，將較早於我們的實施。</p>
<p>我們的實施收買工作，雖經商統會特設收買棉紗棉布辦事處，專責辦理，但因處長人選，初則愼重銓衡，繼經決定聘請聶潞生氏擔任，聶氏謙辭，因之始於昨日正式辦公。我們一方面盼望辦事處從速展開工作；一方面盼望聶氏勉仟艱鉅。因為主持辦事處的人選，既須在棉業界有深厚資望，有專們學騐，又須具有廉正高尚之品格，為公服務之精神，今聶氏兼而有之，自為最理想之人選，商統會當局之所以敦聘與堅挽者，自是出於誠懇。為了安定民生前途，為了復興經濟前途，聶氏業巳打銷辭意，到職就事，收買工作順利實施，我們將然烈以待。</p>
<p>最後，我們更盼望所有棉紗棉布的擁有者，正確認識時代環境的趨勢，政府這次收買棉紗棉布的政令，決不會有所變更，所以，覜望態度將於自身幷無利益，切不可存；而意外希望決不會實現，更不可存。惟有放寬胸襟，向逮處着眼，遵守業規，服從命令。一方面，對於本身因而發生之困難問題，也可給其意見向當局陳述，以求合理解決。</p>
<p>譯論</p>
<h3>强化中國經濟的方法</h3>
<p>國民政府在九日的臨時最高國防會議上，決定收買棉紗棉布暫行條例，對當前最大難關的復興經濟，安定民生問題，踏卜了解決的第一步。</p>
<p>此次國民政府毅然實施此種施策的目的，是想以庫存品作為滑潤劑，而把中國經濟漸次引導到生產活動上去。就是說第一步先把收買的棉製品供給農村，交換米·麥·綿花等，以謀搜集農產物的圓滑化。第二步，由於這農產物之公正的配給，而致力紡微業及其他都市輕工業的復興，並保證維持重要鑛業的生產。這工業生產品用以充作搜集農產物的交換。在這反覆循環的過程中閒，使中國經濟力有飛躍的增進，同時，並謀安定民生，增強國民政府的政治力，而增加對遂行大東亞戰爭的貢獻。這是此次施策的目標。</p>
<p>使中國經濟的復興得以實現的方法，在現狀下，除此以外，恐絕對不能再有所發見了。在這意義上，吾人對國民政府的決斷表示欣幸，同時並希望網羅所有的人才及傾注共完全的力量，以澈底的遂行此方針。</p>
<p>但反過來說，這方法可以說是最後的一着。萬一這收買的物資不能有效地使用，則挽救中國的經濟，將陷於困難。是以有效適切的使用，不能不期共特別愼重。　一點，吾人絕對信任國民政府的能力與努力，而任其處理。中國有極複雜的離開道理的動盪的民心。把握這微妙複雜的動盪心理，視時地而施行適當的施策，唯中國人本身始有此可能。當然，從作戰利益觀點而言，似乎日木不能無條件委棄，但日本在推行對華新政策的大前提下，這微來問題，如果一一加以唯利觀念的干涉，那是錯誤的。這就是使國民政府此次的果斷能獲得最大的收穫的證明。（翔：譯自八月十一日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>新國民運動剛要　第三講續</h3>
<p>— 汪精衛</p>
<p>刻苦耐勞勇猛精進</p>
<p>第六條，所謂紀律化。其最大意義也不過保障好人，淘汰壞人，沒有紀律。好人也會變壞，有（紀律，壞人也要變好中國人向來舒服慣了，隨便慣了，聽了紀律化，十個有九個搖頭，然而非加此不可。</p>
<p>第七條，說到節約，說到生產，由而約與生產脫到廉潔。一個人沒右廉潔的操守，一個社會沒在廉潔的風氣，說不上節約，也說不上生產，廉潔的根源在那裏呢？在公而忘私。嗇一己以裕國家，是廉潔的最大意義，平時能嗇一己以裕國家，臨難纔能犧牲一已救國家。能廉潔　能勇敢，貪污必然成爲懦夫。</p>
<p>在長期戰裏，那一國的國民最能刻苦最能耐勞，便最能接近勝利，獲得勝利。個人爲什麼肯刻苦背耐勞呢？因爲下了決心壽一己以裕國家，爲了國家犧牲尚旦不惜，何有於　呢？可是所謂嗇，所謂犧性，不是消極的意義，而是積極的意義，因爲一己嗇，國家裕了，一己犧牲，國家得救了，舉個例來說，衣食一天比一天　難了，原因何在呢？匪共騷擾，先以游擊，繼以焦土，農村破壞，耕地荒蕪，加以匪共處處割據，把中國分裂成若干小塊，交通斷絕生產也就因之停滯，這是國內生產缺乏的原因。大東亞戰爭以前，以食而論，每年米由印度安南泰國等地入口，最高紀錄是一百二十萬餘噸，最低也是八十萬餘噸，小麥由阿根廷澳洲加拿大等地入口，最高紀錄一百萬餘噸。以衣而論，棉由印度美洲等處入口，常在二百萬公擔以上，戰爭旣起，運輸便利暫時中絕，這是國外輸入短少的原因，以上原因是無可避免的。然而爲什麼別的國家在這種無可避免的悄形之下，統制行得通，公定限價也行得通，而中國却以處碰壁呢？有人說黑市在外國也有，不錯，外國也有黑市，可是外國的黑市，如一張雪白的桌布，有幾星黑點，微乎其微，中國呢大處落墨，一張雪白的桌布，全部變了黑色，只有幾星白點了，這原因是什麼，無非是公而忘私與私而忘公的分別。</p>
<p>諸生，忘了公便是忘了國家了，忘了國家，國家必亡，不待人來亡之。我們如要做三民主義的信徒，要實行新國民運動，要努力參加大束亞戰爭，使中國從戰爭勝利中解放出來，從政府官吏以至學生，以至各種社會的民衆，平日嗇一己以裕國家，刻苦耐勞，臨難犧牲一己以救國家，勇猛精進，除此之外，沒有第二條可走的路。民國三十二年八月十三日燈下（全文完）</p>

<h3>德義兩國會談經過</h3>
<p>談話內容</p>
<p>德義兩國最近曾在義國北部某地舉行會議，德方出席者計里本特洛甫外交部長，麥謀總長加特爾元帥，義國新政府方面出席者計格里利亞外交部長，阿姆勃洛希奧參謀總長。關於墨索里尼辭職後的軸心關係，以及今後戰局的對策，似曾加以審愼的討論。席問義國代表曾報告此次變革國內體制的經過，而要求德國政府的了解承認。同時，對於日趨緊迫的南歐戰局的對策，亦曾討論極重要的作戰問題。據一般的觀測，義軍對於以西四里島爲根據而前來進攻的反軸心軍，在交國本土的防衛，至少需要德軍增援〇〇個師團，空軍飛機〇千架，德軍究能增助若干兵力，這是個問題。德軍方面則以為東部戰　是絕對不能放棄的，尤其在目前的情勢下，　軍正在發揮其猛烈的攻擊力的時候，是以不能從束部戰綫抽出大量的兵力。但墨索里尼下野後，義國的抗戰力或許將趨瓦解之途，祇要義國人民表示繼續戰爭的決意，則德岡政府或將視東部戰綫的悄勢而抽調相當兵力至義國方面。德國政府於檢討戰爭的大局以後，似已決定向義國本士增援扣富兵力。</p>
<p>政變經緯</p>
<p>翻加義岡政鑿的糾緯，中令訓力而，敵國方面亦有稱稱傳說，這中間自然右許多岳雊於股仃的，茲綜合常地所獲帕心方面的悄報，則其大懺經過如下：</p>

<p>時局瞻望</p>
<p>關於嚇剛齣齣國新放約方面會識的壯泄，么月卞一日的朝日新閒社著評加以論述如下：</p>

<p>在一切戰爭中，不間表面上的勳崢如何而衣內歉上常是梅深刻市大的。歐洲戰局，自上月以來，辦週了極年要的時期了。夫一巡一退者，原為戰爭之常縐，但現祚一而則停止了閃黔戰，和像大河崩仕般的總攻罐姿勢，而吐方反軸心方血則取各個擊跛的戰法步步為營，先扎西西里黠與德義軍交戰，如共成功，則袱被狹四拿海峽而北上，同時對德義二岡國內則加以猛州的轟炸，但德義二軍，自常因此而息加昂排共嘰意，二岡氏眾的民氣介魚見縱紫，而魚液歲對任者至此不能不聚首商討，對付新觸血的潑沁切的方綸，而即付之實施。</p>

<p>上月三十一日，中日兩國在南京簽訂日本移讓　稅盬條約後、國府業已規定在華日僑課稅之範圍，並將於最近首次通知日駐華大使館，似可在九月一日起實施。上海日本大使館事務所為充分協力日僑向中國政府納稅，並期　滑實施計，決定於十八十九　日、召備華中華南領事會議。開會第一日由大使館方面詳細說明關於移讓課稅權事，並指示各領事館協力方針後，繼卽答覆各質問。第二日議明國府强制收買紗布及其他緊急經濟措置，雖協議各地圓滑實施物價對策之方法。</p>

<p>學生成績低落原因</p>
<p>目下止海各校學生之成績普遍降低，考厥原因，不外下列數點：　教材不適宜，目前各校所採國定敎科書，固爲過應目　之需要之最理想課本，但詳究其內容，亦不無應加改善之處。　課程標準不合，教授巡度與學生了解程度，往往扦格不入。　敎員不能準時上課、校長持敷衍態度，此　爲因物價日高，生活難難，敎員月得過微，無已，惟有多兼鐘點，　多得收入以維生計。學生課榮進展，乃深受影響。當局對最後一點，最爲關切，決將逐漸設法提高敎職員待遇，生活安定後，自能安心執教。</p>

<h3>一區修正　轉租規則</h3>
<p>第一區公署爲修正轉租房屋執照規則事爲佈告稱：查轉租房屋執照規則，本署決定自本年九月一日起，加以修正，俾其適用節　，擴充至商店在內，而不僅以住宅為限。其修正條　如下：第三次（甲）若轉租之房屋，係作經商之用，領照人應得之利潤。不得超過其所付業主租金百分之五十，至於領照人所繳房捐，執照　、水電費，以及其他各項費用（如有此項費用時）之數目，均按照第三次所載辦通。</p>
<h3>公務人員　捐稅不豁免</h3>
<p>大通社云，泰晤士報云，昨據泰晤士報記者探悉，第一區公署昨爲查　政府官署或第一區公署所僱用之任何個人，或合羣戰員，規避百分之十之旅棧損與酒菜捐、以及百分之二之物品零售捐起見，昨特張貼通告，嚴予取締，昐各注意，同時并希全數有關人員，對任何觸犯法則著。隨時吿發。據查有若于第一區公署職員，在旅館與酒菜館內，謊稱公務人員有免捐之權。而拒付捐稅之事實。其實官方目前免捐之範圍，僅指官用一項而言，並非在政府官署內辦事職員之個人、即有權豁免捐稅。酒菜館咖啡館等、已獲得當局通知，今後切勿使仛何公　員，享受此種特殊權利，任何個人如恃强不付捐稅，應即帶其　入公署。此項辦法，在繳納百分之二之物品零售捐時，亦適用云。購買官用物品者。必持鵝官方證書，始可準其免捐、此種證舊，於購物後，必留於店內，以憑第一區公署審查。最後又據明白宣稱，第一區公署及國民政府所僱用之職員，有權豁免捐稅之說，全屬謬誤。</p>

<p>中央社通訊全國商　統制總會，奉令收買棉紗棉布，其辦事處，業已　備完竣，於昨日正式成立，處長　潞生，副處　曹伯權二氏，　辭再三，經唐理事長　切挽留，已於咋日（十七日）十時同時到會就職，暫假總會會址辦公，並積極將棉紗布配給方案，從連審愼擬訂，以便實施，所睡買中日商人之棉紗棉布，將來一律配給，同樣辦理，並無分別。</p>
<p>棉布收買價格短期內可決定</p>
<p>頃自　係方面　悉、國防會議對於敢買紗布、僅決定棉紗價格一種，即二十支雙股藍　每捆爲一萬元，共餘各種紗布則概未決定，但紗布種類共有百數十種之多，且同一種類貨品亦有優劣，故收買價格之決定，必須異常詳審。是以有關當局現已決定一項原則，即各種棉紗均以二十支藍鳳一捆一萬元爲標準，或增或减，各種棉布亦以紗價爲標準，決定收買價格之多寡，至對於品質粗劣之貨，另行決定價格，以求公允，現中日有關當局，擬在短期間內設置一「價格審查委員會」，然後依照決定價格，從事收買。</p>

<p>潘達發表辦理滬西警政情形</p>
<p>滬西警察局局長潘達主持滬西警政兩年半以來，成績卓著，滬西曾被穩爲「歹士」，今已成爲樂土。現潘氏擢升爲本市市政府簡任參事，查潘氏於二十年前在聖約翰大學研究政治經濟學，爲校長卜舫潛博士所器重，出校後担任會計師及工商界要職，並任公共租界工部局特別警察十餘年，具文武　才，辦事善斷敏捷，昨已卸除警察職務，專任市府參事，記者往訪，承共發表談話如次：</p>
<p>歹土惡名從此消滅</p>
<p>鄙人素習政治經濟學，兼喜研究警政，事變前曾任公共租界工部局特別警察十餘年，對於詩務略俱學識。民國三十年二月一日南府與工部局訂立滬四特警協定，成立滬西特別警察總署，爲中國收囘越界警權之開始，鄙人承陳市長之不棄，與友邦之推愛，忝任總署署長，當時滬西地方，異常紊　，烟館陳塲林立，盜匪白畫行劫，永長官之指禾與全體員警之努力，於數月內將地方一切罪惡，　除殆盡，市民得能安居樂　，滬西「歹土」之惡名，從此消滅。此外調查戶口，舉辦平米，調　工廠風潮，辦理物價統制等等，均努力做去。該時署內有中日英三國國籍之專員，經隨時之調整，均能互相合作，順利施政。</p>
<p>滬西治安更見確立</p>
<p>民國卅一年五月一日協定廢正滬西越界築路　權，完全收囘，實爲收同租界之先聲，滬西特警總署，改組爲上海特別市滬四警察局，鄙人根任局長迄今，亦已年餘，在此時期，灑四治安更見確立，除　員警盡職服務外，史勉其進修，設立圖書室，開闢運動塲等等，以修　其身心。目下　『官多係警校畢業，或已受過符殊訓練，即下級男女警察，亦時常調訓，俱有相當學科術科知識，全體員警，均能奉公守法，廉潔自重，爲國家民衆服務。今者租界收囘，上海全市行政權，完仝統一，從前爲收囘越界警權而設之過渡機關，自應撤銘，鄙人於此得卸仔肩，免致貽誤獲　，更幸得侍市座左右，進求過應學識，雖不敢日功成顥酬，要可引爲快慰，惟是鄙人服役滬西二載有餘，得免隕越，實類上級長官之優容，友邦人士之協助，民衆之該解，友好之提命，乃不致遺誚獲戾，此即銘心感謝，永矢弗援者也。</p>

<h3>生產活動强化的前提</h3>
<p>自當局管理會融取缔投機以來，市而上的遊資，都向）正常方面移動，尤其是最近抑制物價取締囤積强力的執行而後，金融界的力份子，都設法誘　遊資入生席部門，呈現著顯著的現象，此種情形，自有努力育成發　的必要。</p>
<p>從決定收買棉紗棉布以後，給予經濟界很大的衝動，就各個事業而論，或者受到打擊，亦未可知，但就上海全部生產活動講來，足以　之張化，事實上實無疑義。</p>
<p>生產活動之强化，既爲復興經濟之要點，當局者自應排除舊難，努力促其實現。舉凡原料之運進，動力勞力之供給，銷路之確保等，當盡可能予以便利，而資金的充分援助，亦極重要，如果具備正當絛件者，當積極援助，此爲剌漱生產最的效之方法，同時亦即含有促成物價低落之作用，其影饗甚大。</p>
<p>促進生產活動，最重要者爲對資本安仝之保證，同時對於心理不安之狀態，亦必須根除，如何保證資本安仝，此則的待於當局徵集實際之意見，作誠意的討論，而定具體的辦法，此外日本方面，對於華中經濟復興的根本方針，應的積極的支援，和忠言協助，以達成其使命。（節譯八月十七日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>物資調查委員會　將開三次會議　並以繼續調查其他囤積物資</h3>
<p>物資調查委員會，調查本市團　物資，第一步調查棉紗布工作，所的第一第八兩區內二百三十三家公共倉庫存　之棉紗棉布，自經中日調查官率領調查員分三十給調查完竣後，卽繼續調查七十家私人蒼庫堆存之紗布，約本週內可仝部調查竣事。一方面同時審查各調查員之調查報告，其未經登記之棉紗布查出時，將栓舉報告主管當局處置，聞該會現定本月二十日另開第三官報告調查結果，付諸討論外，並討論更進一步調查工作，至於其他物資之</p>
<h3>三省兩市物資　申請移出手續</h3>
<p>重要資自三省兩市移入其他地域，須先向各地主管官署申請移入許可，然後持憑該項許可書，向商統會許可事務組申請核發移出承認書，惟該會於核發移出承認書時，對於該發貨人均以曾怒加入各該地之同業公會爲會員者爲限，否則即不予承認‘近開商統會爲使各地商民明瞭此項申請手續起見，已轉請行政院分別咨令華北政務委員會及三省　市以外之各省市政府暨特區行政公署，轉行各主管官署於申請移入時，告如各該申請人加以注意，以免周折。</p>
<h3>新設保險業　不准登記</h3>
<p>自實業部成史保險華監理局以來，本市保險業大部已申請核準，準予　業、尙有多家刻在審查中。惟邇來營業保險業務之公司，仍　有開設，頃據實業部保險解釋，此項新設之保險公司，均係限期前辦妥登記手續者。凡在三十一年十二月二十八日以後設立者，即不准登記。</p>
<h3>行莊扶助各業資金　中儲允予供給</h3>
<p>中央儲備銀行暨銀行聯合準備會錢業聯合準備庫爲調劑同業資金，安定市面起見，允供給頭寸　理拆借，維持同業各行莊後，整個金融已趨穩定，　根已不若過去之緊念，各小銀行獲得調劑，已轉趨安定，所以除江浙企業銀行停業外，其他同業均巳不致發生不幸事件。昨悉，各行莊爲鞏固本身基礎計，對於放款問題，業已各自審　，依照財政部前頒之三項限制辦法，以及銀錢業通過之放款新辦法，切實遵行，關於貨物抵押貸放已特別緊縮，　　食，紗布，以及日用必需之品完全拒絕，信用於款竭力設法减少。惟各　因發展生座事業需要款項，行莊仍允予酌董核貸，出視各業實　　形規定貸放之最高額。至於各行　因扶助各　需要之資金，則由中央　備銀有供給，冉由行莊轉貸與各業、聞利率一項，較普通爲低。也接受中儲供給資金之有莊，辦理　貸之款，須報吿中央儲備銀　　查。</p>

<h3>安慰</h3>
<p>— 梁檬</p>
<p>安慰、每個人都需要，、尤其是彷徨於苦　中的靑年。</p>
<p>假使一味追求著安慰而沉溺於安慰；安慰將會變成浪陰險的敵人。</p>
<p>人需柴愛，但僅僅　醉在這圈子中，悔恨將會接蹝而來。</p>
<p>安慰必需要變　鼓勵。推動人去爭取成功。</p>
<h3>夏夜談蟬</h3>
<p>— 徐輝光</p>
<p>春風桃李，秋雨梧　，每個季節，大自然都着意渲染，不　掉以輕心；點綴夏天的，是綠樹業里長嘶着底蟬聲：</p>
<p>寒暑表上逐漸升高的溫度，加上窗外　囂的蟬聲，使人起一種熱關的感覺，而使我更親切的，覺到的是童年時代嬉遊的樂趣，聽　蟬聲想起故鄉的弟弟或是同了　伴，　了長竹竿，　着汗在捕捉蟬兒吧！</p>
<p>三四星期　，挾了一本　，囘宿舍去就寢，室內光綫黯淡。窗戶都打開着窗外月光如水，粉牆上搖曳着柳樹底疏影，幾位友人都躺在牀上，海闊天空的在談天，我把電燈扭亮了。</p>
<p>「刷……！」一聲，突然一隻蟬兒從窗外飛進來，繞着燈光，　飛亂擈。</p>
<p>「撲！」的一聲，從牆上撞跌在地上，我急忙趕過去捉起來。</p>
<p>「知了……」蟬振動著薄明的雙　，我心里充滿了喜悅。</p>
<p>「還是放了吧！」道主義的思想與童心的自私在我心里交織着，不禁猶　不定。</p>
<p>友人們似乎也很高興，談録韓倒蟬身上去，大半主張把牠放了，於是我手伸向窗外，把牠向上空一拋。</p>
<p>「刷……！」蟬仍從窗外飛進來，繞着燈光，亂飛亂撲，終於又跌在地上這樣放出又飛進來接連，三次，終於我把電燈熄了，放牠出去。躺到牀上，想起這小動物酷愛光明的表現、使我一時轉輾反側的不能入睡。</p>
<p>愛好光明，　是大部份動物的天性，即如蜜蜂蒼蠅之微，投在玻璃窗上亂撲的情景，使人爲之感動！蟬是酷愛光明的，但是因爲盲目迫求的綠故，倒反而易趨於毀滅，而孩子們便，利用着牠盲目追求光明的弱點，在捕蟬的長竹竿上紮了一個環形的鐵絲圈圈上黏了一個圓錐形的紙袋，袋尖上用剪刀剪去一些些，露出一個小扎，以通光綫，紙袋罩上蟬的時候，蟬頓感黑暗，急向光明處飛，投入袋的尖端，而　　便被容積很小的袋尖國困住，「英雄無用武之地」的被捉住了。</p>
<p>看見蟬，使我聯想起燈蛾來雖然人們見仁見智，觀點不同。但是這些小生命追求光明，捨身蹈火刃所不辭的精神，亦足以使人感動的了！</p>

<h3>Unfolding the Work of Purchasing Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>Since the National Government explicitly ordered the purchase of existing cotton yarn and cloth in Shanghai, entrusting the National Commercial Control Association with full authority to handle the procurement, all parties have paid close attention to this matter. As the Japanese Asahi Shimbun editorial stated (see today's translated comments), "It is the first step towards resolving the current greatest difficulties of economic recovery and stabilizing people's livelihoods." Because this measure, if thoroughly implemented and further practiced with rational distribution, will stabilize a portion of people's livelihoods, and the revitalization of China's economy can naturally be expected. Conversely, if it cannot be thoroughly implemented and rational distribution cannot be practiced, then the results will naturally make it impossible to achieve the stability of people's livelihoods and economic recovery. The Asahi Shimbun editorial also stated, "If the purchased materials cannot be used effectively, saving China's economy will be difficult. Therefore, effective and appropriate use must be taken with special care." This is completely consistent with our, and it can be said, the common feeling of most Chinese people.</p>
<p>"From the perspective of operational interests, it seems that Japan cannot unconditionally relinquish them, but under the major premise of Japan's promotion of a new policy towards China, it would be a mistake to interfere with these trivial issues with a profit-only mentality." The Asahi Shimbun further explained the frank purpose of the friendly nation regarding this measure, and therefore, the expectations for the National Government are particularly earnest.</p>
<p>Let us look again at the statement issued by Ambassador Gu after the National Government announced the order, which fully expressed cooperation and support, and the purchase of yarn and cloth owned by Japanese merchants, in coordination with our measures. The Japanese side has now established a temporary Yarn and Cloth Management Office by the Central China Trade Federation to handle the procurement, and the implementation of the procurement regulations has also been approved by the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy. Therefore, the procurement work on the Japanese side will be implemented earlier than ours.</p>
<p>Although our implementation of the procurement work has been specially set up by the Commercial Control Association as an office for purchasing cotton yarn and cloth, specifically responsible for handling it, the selection of the director was initially carefully considered, and then it was decided to hire Mr. Nie Lusheng, but Mr. Nie humbly declined, so it officially started yesterday. On the one hand, we hope that the office will start its work as soon as possible; on the other hand, we hope that Mr. Nie will strive to overcome difficulties. Because the person in charge of the office must have deep qualifications and experience in the cotton industry, as well as a clean and noble character and a spirit of serving the public. Now that Mr. Nie has both, he is naturally the most ideal candidate, and the authorities of the Commercial Control Association are sincere in their persuasion and strong retention. For the sake of the future of stabilizing people's livelihoods and the future of economic recovery, Mr. Nie has already dismissed his intention to resign and has taken office, and we will look forward to the smooth implementation of the procurement work.</p>
<p>Finally, we further hope that all owners of cotton yarn and cloth will correctly recognize the trend of the times. The government's decree on purchasing cotton yarn and cloth will not be changed. Therefore, the attitude of waiting and watching will not benefit oneself, and should not be held. Unexpected hopes will not be realized, and should not be held. Only by broadening one's mind, looking at the overall situation, abiding by industry rules, and obeying orders can one succeed. On the one hand, for the difficult problems that may arise for oneself, one can also give their opinions to the authorities for a reasonable solution.</p>
<p>Translated Comments</p>
<h3>Methods to Strengthen the Chinese Economy</h3>
<p>The National Government, at the Provisional Supreme National Defense Conference on the 9th, decided on the Provisional Regulations for the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth, taking the first step towards resolving the current greatest difficulties of economic recovery and stabilizing people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>The purpose of the National Government's resolute implementation of this policy is to use inventories as lubricants to gradually guide the Chinese economy into productive activities. That is to say, the first step is to supply the purchased cotton products to the countryside in exchange for rice, wheat, cotton, etc., in order to streamline the collection of agricultural products. The second step is to strive for the revitalization of the textile industry and other urban light industries through the fair distribution of these agricultural products, and to guarantee the maintenance of the production of important mining industries. These industrial products are used to exchange for the collection of agricultural products. In this repeated cycle, China's economic strength will be greatly increased, and at the same time, it will seek to stabilize people's livelihoods, enhance the political power of the National Government, and increase its contribution to the execution of the Greater East Asia War. This is the goal of this policy.</p>
<p>Under the current situation, there is absolutely no other way to realize the revitalization of the Chinese economy. In this sense, we express our joy at the National Government's decision, and at the same time, we hope to recruit all talents and devote their full strength to thoroughly implement this policy.</p>
<p>But conversely, this method can be said to be the last resort. If the purchased materials cannot be used effectively, saving China's economy will be difficult. Therefore, effective and appropriate use must be taken with special care. On this point, we absolutely trust the National Government's ability and efforts and leave it to them to handle. China has an extremely complex and erratic public sentiment that deviates from reason. Only the Chinese themselves have the ability to grasp this subtle and complex fluctuating psychology and implement appropriate policies according to the time and place. Of course, from the perspective of operational interests, it seems that Japan cannot unconditionally relinquish them, but under the major premise of Japan's promotion of a new policy towards China, it would be a mistake to interfere with these trivial issues with a profit-only mentality. This is proof that the National Government's decisive action this time can achieve the greatest results. (翔: Translated from the August 11th Western Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<h3>The Imperial Japanese Headquarters Announces the War Results of the Air Force's First Attack on the Enemy Airfield in Papua</h3>
<p>Tokyo 17th (Central News Agency) The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced today: Our air force attacked the enemy airfield in Papua, seventy kilometers from Lae, on the 15th and 16th. In the air battle, 39 enemy planes were shot down (including 7 unconfirmed), and 5 planes on the ground were destroyed. Four of our planes have not yet returned.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) The decisive battle between the Japanese and American forces in the Southwest Pacific is becoming increasingly fierce. The Japanese air force launched another long-range attack on August 15th and 16th, making a surprise attack on the enemy airfield in Papua, New Guinea for the first time, achieving great results. In this battle, a joint formation of Japanese fighters and bombers flew to the enemy airfield in Papua at 8:25 on the 15th, and immediately launched a fierce attack on more than 20 enemy Bell (P-39) and Curtiss (P-40) planes and 10 transport planes that were on air alert there. As a result of the fierce battle, in addition to the confirmed shooting down of 14 enemy fighters and 4 transport planes, 10 enemy transport planes parked on the ground were bombed, and 15 of them were hit and caught fire. In this battle, 2 Japanese planes also failed to return. On the following day (16th), a joint formation of fighter-bombers attacked the airfield again, engaging in combat with 50 enemy fighters. As a result, 14 enemy Lockheed (P-38) planes, 2 Bell (P-39) planes, 4 Curtiss (P-40) planes, and 1 Liberator plane, totaling 21 planes (including 7 unconfirmed) were shot down. In this battle, 3 Japanese planes failed to return. In these two battles, the damage inflicted on the enemy was not only the shooting down of 32 enemy planes and the destruction of 5 enemy planes, but also, at a time when the United States was suffering from a shortage of air force personnel, the loss of enemy air force personnel in this battle was at least 50 or more. Such damage to the enemy army can be said to be even greater than the loss of its planes.</p>
<p>The results of five attacks on enemy convoys</p>
<p>Tokyo 17th (Central News Agency) The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced at 4:45 p.m. on the 17th that since July 12th, the Japanese naval air force has been on alert for the actions of enemy convoys and escort warships advancing westward from the Guadalcanal Island area. On the night of the 14th, the enemy showed signs of advancing in the direction of Vella Lavella Island, so a fierce attack was launched on them starting on the morning of the 15th. The war results obtained are as follows: The first attack squadron boldly attacked an enemy transport convoy in the strait near the south coast of Vella Lavella Island, which was being guarded by 50 enemy planes, sinking one large enemy transport ship and setting three other large and medium-sized transport ships on fire. It also shot down 13 enemy fighters. The second attack squadron attacked the enemy convoy again, overcoming the resistance of enemy fighters, sinking two large enemy transport ships and one landing craft. Several bombs were dropped in the immediate vicinity of one large enemy transport ship, one large destroyer, and one cargo motorboat. Machine guns were used to strafe approximately 10 enemy landing craft. Our planes also shot down 11 enemy fighters. The third attack squadron engaged enemy fighters and attacked near the enemy landing site. One bomb hit one enemy cruiser, causing two fires. It also shot down four enemy fighters. The fourth attack squadron attacked an enemy convoy 6 miles south of Simberi Island and 15 miles southeast of Buka. One large enemy destroyer was sunk, and another enemy destroyer was damaged. A separate attack squadron that attacked the enemy's follow-up convoy discovered an enemy transport ship 10 miles east of Kaga Island at midnight on August 15th. The attack squadron immediately bombed one large enemy cruiser, sinking one large transport ship and one light cruiser or large destroyer. Two torpedoes also hit one enemy cruiser and one destroyer respectively. In the above attacks, the Japanese side suffered a total of 17 planes destroyed by self-explosion or that did not return.</p>
<p>More than half of the American casualties in the Solomon battle</p>
<p>Tokyo 17th (Central News Agency) The war in the Solomon Islands has become increasingly fierce recently, and American losses have also been increasing daily. It is said that the total number of wounded and sick soldiers has reached 60% of the entire army. According to the statements of an American officer of the 42nd Division of the American army captured near New Georgia Island recently, and the records in the numerous documents confiscated, the actual situation is already clear. According to this investigation, the American 43rd Division, under the command of Major General Hester, landed on Rendova Island on June 30th. The number of troops was approximately 10,000. The American forces attacking the New Georgia Island area consisted of five to four enemy divisions, including a naval team, totaling approximately 45,000 to 60,000. Since the American landing, approximately 30 days ago, approximately 10,000 have been killed or wounded. The total number of those who have lost their combat effectiveness due to malignant malaria and mental illness has reached 60% of the total strength. Therefore, the American army is now actively increasing the number of new troops in order to replace them. According to the investigation by the American authorities, it has been discovered that a considerable number of them are pretending to be mentally ill out of fear of this fierce battle, attempting to retreat to the rear.</p>

<h3>The New Director of Intelligence of the Japanese Embassy, ​​Kishi Ichiichi, Gives a Speech</h3>
<p>Chinese and Japanese People Are Determined to Move Forward in Building the Future of Greater East Asia</p>
<p>Nanjing 17th (Central News Agency) The newly appointed Counselor and Director of Intelligence of the Japanese Embassy in China, Mr. Kishi Ichiichi, met with the Chinese press corps at the Embassy at 3 p.m. on the 17th. More than 20 reporters from various newspapers attended. Mr. Kishi answered the questions raised by the reporters in detail. The main points are recorded as follows: (Question) What are your aspirations at the beginning of your term? (Answer) I have been dedicated to the work of Sino-Japanese cooperation for half of my life, and my determination is very firm. This time, I am appointed as the Director of Intelligence of the Embassy, ​​and I deeply hope that Minister Lin of the Ministry of Propaganda of the National Government and the officials of the Ministry of Propaganda, especially the people in the friendly press, will give me guidance so that I can complete the mission entrusted to me. (Question) What are your views on general construction? (Answer) Nanjing has been affected by changes, and construction has been frustrated. However, since the National Government returned to the capital, it has been actively engaged in restoration and construction. At the time of the ongoing war, there are certain obstacles to completing the construction of Nanjing. I deeply hope that the municipal authorities will overcome all difficulties and actively promote it, so as to achieve success as soon as possible. As for the necessary conditions for construction, it should be carried out in both material and spiritual aspects. (Question) Are there any differences in opinion between the people of China and Japan regarding the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere? (Answer) I believe that China and Japan should share the responsibility for revitalizing China and defending East Asia. If we look back at President Wang's remarks, this will prove that there is no difference of opinion between the people of China and Japan. Even if there are some differences of opinion between the people of the two countries regarding the construction of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the people of the two countries should be aware of the spirit of sharing weal and woe and living and dying together. They can also abandon their small differences and return to mutual cooperation, and move forward courageously towards the construction of Greater East Asia. (Question) Although traditional thinking has been influenced by Anglo-American thought in recent years, there is no hope of cleansing and correcting this. Chinese youth should now recognize the importance of the new era, sweep away the past thoughts of being immersed in the United Kingdom and the United States, and unite the youth of Japan and even the youth of all East Asian countries to advance towards the construction of a new world. (Question) What are your opinions on the construction of Greater Shanghai? (Answer) The construction of Greater Shanghai cannot be completed in a short period of time, but it can be implemented step by step according to the plan, and it can be seen that it will be a great success soon. In the near future, Greater Shanghai will become the economic center of China in name and reality, and the trade hub of the entire East Asia will also be located on the Shanghai Bund.</p>
<h3>Yang Kuiyi Discusses the General Situation of Administration in Hubei Province</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) Yang Kuiyi, Governor of Hubei Province, came to Beijing by plane on the 12th to report to the central government on the recent military and political situation in Hubei Province and to request instructions on the Anti-Communist Affairs in Hubei Province. He paid a visit to the Chairman on the 13th and reported everything. The Central News Agency reporter interviewed Mr. Yang yesterday, and he gave a statement as follows: Generally speaking, the military and political facilities in Hubei Province have made progress in the past year. In order to adapt to the wartime economic system, in addition to the establishment of the Materials Review Committee and the Wuhan Branch of the National Commercial Control Association, the Hubei Production Increase Committee has also been established. In terms of finance, after the counties began to collect various taxes such as the business tax prescribed by the central government, the total amount was handed over to the provincial government, and the financial revenue has greatly increased compared to the past. In terms of education, one high school, one girls' high school, and one vocational school have been established this semester. In addition, an agricultural college has also been established. The friendly nation of Japan has also transferred the Jinshi Farm to our country, and all previous losses have been gradually restored. The salt in Hubei Province was originally managed by the authorities of the friendly nation, but it has now been transferred to the provincial government. The salt in the counties has also implemented a distribution system. The price of rice is between 45 and 50 military tickets per stone, and the lives of the people, military police, and civil servants are very stable. The local area is peaceful, prosperous and restored.</p>

<h3>New National Movement Outline - Lecture 3 (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Wang Jingwei</p>
<p>Hard Work, Endurance, Courage, and Diligence</p>
<p>Article 6, the so-called disciplining. Its greatest significance is nothing more than protecting good people and eliminating bad people. Without discipline, good people will also turn bad. With discipline, bad people will also improve. Chinese people have always been accustomed to comfort and casualness. Upon hearing about disciplining, nine out of ten will shake their heads, yet it is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Article 7 speaks of frugality and production, extending from frugality and production to integrity. If an individual lacks integrity and a society lacks an atmosphere of integrity, there can be no talk of frugality or production. Where does the root of integrity lie? In being public-minded and forgetting self-interest. Being thrifty with oneself to enrich the country is the greatest meaning of integrity. Being able to be thrifty with oneself to enrich the country in peacetime enables one to sacrifice oneself to save the country in times of crisis. Being able to be honest and brave, corruption inevitably leads to cowardice.</p>
<p>In a protracted war, the nation whose people are most capable of enduring hardship and toil will be the closest to victory and will obtain victory. Why are individuals willing to endure hardship and toil? Because they are determined to be thrifty with themselves to enrich the country, and for the sake of the country, they will not hesitate to sacrifice themselves. What is there to fear? However, the so-called thrift and sacrifice are not passive but active. Because one is thrifty, the country becomes enriched; because one sacrifices oneself, the country is saved. For example, clothing and food are becoming increasingly difficult to obtain day by day. What is the reason? Communist bandits harass, first with guerrilla tactics, then with scorched earth. The countryside is devastated, and arable land lies barren. In addition, the Communist bandits carve up China into several small pieces. Transportation is cut off, and production stagnates. This is the reason for the lack of domestic production. Before the Greater East Asia War, taking food as an example, rice was imported annually from India, Annam, Thailand, and other places, with a record high of over 1.2 million tons and a minimum of 800,000 tons. Wheat was imported from Argentina, Australia, Canada, and other places, with a record high of over 1 million tons. Taking clothing as an example, cotton was imported from India, America, and other places, often exceeding 2 million metric tons. Since the war began, transportation has been temporarily interrupted. This is the reason for the shortage of foreign imports. The above reasons are unavoidable. However, why is it that other countries, under these unavoidable circumstances, can make controls work and fixed prices work, while China encounters obstacles everywhere? Some say that black markets also exist in foreign countries. That is true. Foreign countries also have black markets, but the black markets in foreign countries are like a snow-white tablecloth with a few black spots, insignificant. In China, however, the brushstrokes are large; a snow-white tablecloth has turned entirely black, with only a few white spots. What is the reason for this? It is nothing more than the difference between being public-minded and forgetting self-interest and being self-interested and forgetting the public good.</p>
<p>Students, forgetting the public good is forgetting the country. Forgetting the country will inevitably lead to the country's demise, without waiting for others to destroy it. If we want to be followers of the Three Principles of the People, to implement the New National Movement, and to strive to participate in the Greater East Asia War, so that China can be liberated from the war victoriously, from government officials to students, to the masses of all kinds of society, in peacetime, we must be thrifty with ourselves to enrich the country, endure hardship and toil, and in times of crisis, sacrifice ourselves to save the country, with courage and diligence. Apart from this, there is no other path to take. Under the lamp on August 13, 1943 (End of full text)</p>
<h3>Hsing-Ya Group Conference Passes Resolution of Gratitude to the National Government</h3>
<p>Hsinking, 17th (Central News Agency Telegraph) The Hsing-Ya Group Conference, when it continued its second-day meeting on the 17th, unanimously passed a resolution of gratitude to the Government of the Republic of China.

<h3>Battles Increasingly Fierce in Belgrade Area, German Counterattack on Kharkov Front</h3>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency Telegraph) Havas reports: The German High Command announced in a war bulletin that the enemy's various local offensives in the Kuban bridgehead area and the middle reaches of the Donets River front have all failed. In the Belgrade area, the Red Army's offensives are becoming increasingly fierce, but after our infantry's heroic hand-to-hand combat and fierce counterattacks, they have been repelled. During this, our tank units and assault teams penetrated the enemy's flanks, encircling and annihilating the enemy's main force. The Red Army's offensive in the Orel area has weakened. In the Vyazma area, the Bely area, and the Lake Laiva area, the Red Army has increased its attacks, but the enemy is suffering heavy losses in both personnel and equipment everywhere. Yesterday alone, the enemy lost 193 tanks. Our air force is assisting the army, especially the southern and central armies, and has been quite successful in attacking enemy stations and deploying troops.</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency Telegraph) Colonel Hama, a military correspondent for the German News Agency, said: The battle of Belgrade has been going on for six weeks. Last Sunday, German tanks carried out a concentrated attack, resulting in an important tactical success. After several days of hard fighting, the German army has encircled a large group of Soviet troops, including about 100 tanks and several motorized rifle regiments. The Soviet troops of this group are now squeezed into a small area and are gradually being annihilated.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 17th (Central News Agency Telegraph) Moscow reports: A bulletin issued by the Soviet Information Bureau last night acknowledged that German infantry and tank units launched a counterattack in the Kharkov area yesterday, but the bulletin did not specify the exact location of this counterattack.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 17th (Central Press Agency Telegraph) According to Turkish newspapers, the Soviet army's losses in manpower and materials are completely beyond expectations. This was revealed by anti-Axis and neutral countries from Moscow to Istanbul. Reliable sources say that the Soviet army's losses in the seven months of this year totaled two million dead, wounded, and captured. The Soviet army's winter offensive resulted in 1.5 million deaths, and the summer offensive resulted in about 500,000 deaths. Moscow is extremely disappointed that it has suffered heavy sacrifices but has still not been able to overcome the resistance of the German army on the Eastern Front. On this day, France was attacked, and three bombers and eight fighters did not return to their bases afterward.</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Aircraft Bomb Paris</h3>
<p>Vichy, 17th (Central News Agency Telegraph) Havas reports: It was learned here tonight that the Paris area was again heavily bombed by Anglo-American aircraft.

Reliable sources also say that the war's endgame seems to be under close review, but the Anglo-American-Canadian operational target remains Italy, while the German homeland is being subjected to unprecedented heavy bombing, with operational plans for being implemented in the near future.</p>

<h3>Details of German-Italian Talks</h3>
<p>Content of Talks</p>
<p>Germany and Italy recently held a meeting in northern Italy. The German side was represented by Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, Chief of the General Staff Marshal Keitel, and the new Italian government was represented by Foreign Minister Guariglia and Chief of Staff Ambrosio. They seemed to have carefully discussed the Axis relationship after Mussolini's resignation and the countermeasures for the war situation in the future. During the meeting, the Italian representatives reported on the process of the recent change in the domestic system and requested the understanding and recognition of the German government. At the same time, they also discussed extremely important operational issues regarding countermeasures for the increasingly urgent war situation in southern Europe. According to general observation, the Italian army, in defending the Italian mainland against the anti-Axis forces attacking from Sicily, requires at least 10 German divisions and 1,000 air force planes as reinforcements. The question is how many troops the German army can assist with. The German side believes that the Eastern Front cannot be abandoned absolutely, especially in the current situation when the Soviet army is exerting its fierce offensive power, so it cannot withdraw a large number of troops from the Eastern Front. However, after Mussolini's downfall, Italy's resistance may be on the verge of disintegration. As long as the Italian people express their determination to continue the war, the German government may draw a considerable number of troops to Italy depending on the situation on the Eastern Front. After reviewing the overall war situation, the German government seems to have decided to reinforce Italy with considerable troops.</p>
<p>Details of the Coup</p>
<p>Regarding the details of the Italian political change, there are also various rumors from the enemy side. Naturally, there are many uncertainties among them. Based on the information obtained from reliable sources, the general outline is as follows:</p>
<p>Dissatisfaction with the Fascist regime's war policy was expressed within the Italian government and the military. Even within the military, some people did not agree with Mussolini's war policy. This unstable situation had long been rumored among the Italian people. Since the Axis forces were forced to retreat in Sicily, the British military entered the Italian mainland day by day. The food situation also became increasingly difficult. Therefore, the anti-Mussolini sentiment among the Italian people gradually intensified. The intention of some people in the military to ask Mr. Mussolini to resign became even more pronounced. On July 24th, when the British and American forces entered Sicily, the situation became extremely urgent. Moreover, even within the Sicilian front, people opposed Mr. Mussolini emerged. With the situation becoming so critical, it was impossible to draw troops to the Italian mainland when the decisive battle on the Eastern Front was approaching. Therefore, Mr. Mussolini had no choice but to agree to conduct a joint Italo-German operation against the Allied forces in southern Italy. On the same day, upon receiving reports that the British and American armies were approaching Rome, he abruptly returned to Rome. At that point, Count Grandi, who opposed Mr. Mussolini for party reasons within the Sicilian front, demanded a public vote of no confidence from Mr. Mussolini, passing a resolution demanding Mr. Mussolini's resignation. (Note: Translated from the August 11th edition of the Eastern Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<p>Outlook on the Situation</p>
<p>Regarding the recent meeting between the new officials of the Italian government, the Asahi Shimbun commented on August 1st as follows:</p>
<p>On July 19th, the two giants, Hitler and Mussolini, met in Bologna, northern Italy, to come up with a plan to save Italy. Besides obtaining more powerful assistance from Germany, there was no other way. Under these desperate circumstances, Mr. Mussolini left Rome on the 17th and went to Feltre, a border town north of Bologna, to meet with Hitler, presenting the facts of Sicily and requesting reinforcements. During that meeting, Hitler refused to call the joint meeting he had promised earlier. Mr. Mussolini strongly opposed the convening of that meeting. Excluding the period from 6:00 PM on July 24th to 3:00 AM on July 25th, Mr. Mussolini first reported the beginning and end of his meeting with Hitler, followed by Count Grandi claiming that the failure to obtain sufficient German assistance in Mr. Mussolini's North Italian negotiations led to the political failure, and convened the first important German-Italian meeting in a certain place with a discussion vote of 19 to 7. It is very common for the heads of diplomacy and military affairs of the country to hold consultations, but the meeting after the change of the Italian government is for the future of the cooperation of the two countries in the midst of the raging war), so it is truly worthy of attention.</p>
<p>In all wars, no matter how much the superficial glory shines, there are always deep and great regrets inside. The European war has reached an extremely important period since last month. The back-and-forth is originally a common thread of war, but now, on one side, the blitzkrieg has stopped, and the total offensive posture is like the collapse of a great river. On the other side, the anti-Axis side takes the tactic of individual strikes and advances step by step. First, they fight the German and Italian armies in Sicily. If they succeed, they will cross the Strait of Messina and head north. At the same time, they will bombard the German and Italian countries with fierce firepower. However, the German and Italian armies, since they often face this situation, are willing to cooperate. With the collapse of the people's morale of the two countries, those in power cannot help but gather to discuss and implement measures to deal with the newly emerging situation.</p>
<p>Originally, Anglo-Saxon propaganda was extremely clever, a kind of psychological warfare that disturbed people's minds. But the arrogant England is now hoping that the defeated two countries will remember the relationship between the previous war and this war and deeply study its meaning. Assuming that the United States and the United Kingdom were to win, this would choose two brutal countries.</p>
<p>Then, the dismembered beating of the German and Italian countries will make their people no longer have the possibility of regaining their strength. This is not imaginable. Perhaps some people predict that Europe may be at risk of becoming red, but the United States and the United Kingdom will be satisfied only if they achieve the goal of controlling the world, and the interests of the various nations of the European continent are not in their eyes at all. Even if there is a risk of becoming red, just give each a small room for a while. If it cannot be solved slowly, perhaps consider using other methods. In short, in the so-called war of being eaten, no retreat is allowed, with beginnings and no ends, so the current urgent task, in addition to suppressing the total force of war and igniting the will to war, should be viewed from a high place, exerting the greatest force to narrow and utilize the war power. (Note: Translated from the August 11th edition of the Fourth Regional Newspaper).</p>

<h3>Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office to Hold Consular Conference Today to Explain Transfer of Taxation Rights</h3>
<p>After China and Japan signed the treaty on the transfer of Japanese taxation rights in Nanjing on the 31st of last month, the National Government has already stipulated the scope of taxation for Japanese residents in China and will notify the Japanese Embassy in China for the first time in the near future. It seems that it can be implemented from September 1st. The Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office decided to hold a Consular Conference of Central and South China on the 18th and 19th in order to fully assist Japanese residents in paying taxes to the Chinese government and to smoothly implement the plan. On the first day of the meeting, the embassy will explain in detail the matter of transferring taxation rights, and after instructing the cooperation policy of the various consulates, it will immediately answer various questions.

<h3>Each Person to Receive One Sheng of Rice for the 44th Period, Two Jin of Flour for the 45th Period</h3>
<p>It was heard that the First District Office and the Third Police Station of this city simultaneously issued a notice yesterday: "The No. 44 Joint Flour Ticket must be used to purchase flour by August 19th of this year, and will be invalid after the expiration date. During the period from August 19th to August 24th of this year, the retail rice stores and rice stalls will only sell rice with the No. 44 Price Rice Joint Ticket. The retail rice stores shall sell one sheng of white rice and/or broken rice and/or brown rice for six yuan when they receive each ticket marked with the store number and/or number. During the period from August 22nd to August 30th of this year, the retail rice stores and rice stalls will only sell flour with the No. 45 Flour Purchase Joint Ticket. The retail rice stores shall sell two jin of No. 2 flour for fourteen yuan when they receive each ticket marked with the store number. As for how much rice can be purchased with the No. 45 Rice Purchase Ticket, a separate announcement will be made. Furthermore, the retail rice stores and rice stalls will be temporarily closed on August 20th and August 31st.</p>
<h3>School Opening Dates in the Urban Area</h3>
<p>The education authorities of this city stated that the school opening dates for the autumn semester have been unified for all schools in the urban area and Districts 1 and 8. Middle schools are scheduled to open on the 24th of this month, and elementary schools on the 22nd. The subsidies for private schools in District 1 that were approved and issued by the former Municipal Council will continue to be issued, and they will be further cared for. The second installment of subsidies for this year has already been notified to the schools that should receive them, and they can take their receipts to the Education Office to claim them from today onwards.</p>
<p>Reasons for Poor Student Performance</p>
<p>The academic performance of students in Shanghai schools has generally declined. The reasons for this are no more than the following: 1. Unsuitable teaching materials. The national textbooks currently adopted by various schools are indeed the most ideal textbooks to meet the needs of the current situation, but after careful study of their content, there are also places that should be improved. 2. Unsuitable curriculum standards. The pace of teaching often does not match the level of understanding of the students. 3. Teachers cannot attend classes on time, and principals take a perfunctory attitude. This is because prices are rising every day, life is difficult, and teachers' monthly income is too low. Therefore, they have no choice but to take on more hours to earn more income to maintain their livelihood. Students' academic progress is greatly affected. The authorities are most concerned about the last point and have decided to gradually find ways to improve the treatment of teachers and staff. After their lives are stabilized, they will be able to teach with peace of mind.</p>
<h3>Various Offices in the Urban Area Temporarily Use Old Seals, News Prevention Has Not Been Issued Yet</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the takeover of the two concessions, the administration of Greater Shanghai has become unified. In order to easily supervise, the municipal government has adopted a district governance system, dividing the entire city into eight major districts. The details have already been reported in the newspapers. It has been learned that although the district offices have been established, they will temporarily use the old seals before the new seals are received.</p>
<h3>Adhesive Paper for Glass Windows, Various Districts Notify One After Another</h3>
<p>The police authorities recently notified various stores to vertically paste strips of tough paper on windows and glass doors and windows. This was first implemented in the Old Gate District, and starting yesterday, the various Baojia districts in the First District have followed suit. The Baojia heads separately notified the stores and residents in their respective jurisdictions to handle the matter in accordance with the law. As for the pasting method, it varies slightly depending on the situation, but the purpose is to prevent the glass from breaking. It has also been learned that other districts outside the First District seem to be preparing to handle the matter in succession.</p>
<h3>Gong Wenhuan Broadcast</h3>
<p>The monthly broadcast of the Municipal Propaganda Office was delivered last night by Gong Wenhuan, Director of the Shanghai Rural Clearing Zone Business Training Institute, entitled "The New Spirit We Should Have After the Recovery of the Concessions." He elaborated in detail on the establishment of a strong self-reliant force, the revitalization and construction of a new Shanghai, and the development of Eastern moral spirit from the perspective of education and culture.</p>
<h3>Egg Rationing Measures</h3>
<p>Regarding the egg rationing matters, it is learned that all the eggs will be allocated on the principle of half to the export group and half to the domestic sales group. If either party needs more or less, the board of directors of the association will decide to temporarily change the allocation. When duck eggs are needed for export, the export group will be allocated up to 50 percent. If there is no need for export, all the duck eggs will be allocated to the domestic sales group. Preserved eggs and salted eggs will all be allocated to the domestic sales group. The association allocates eggs to its members, but egg merchants who only have purchasing power and no egg shop facilities, even if they join the association as members, have no allocation rights. Egg allocation is divided into direct allocation and indirect allocation. Direct allocation is directly allocated by the association to its members on a regular basis. Indirect allocation is available to retail egg shops, those who sell eggs in addition to other businesses, and egg vendors in this city who register to apply for allocation. Egg prices are divided into five types: A, B, C, D, and E. The association will announce them on a regular or daily basis. Egg prices are subject to change, either up or down. When prices rise, the board of directors of the association will stipulate the announcement to be implemented within the specified date. When prices fall, the board of directors of the association will announce the purchase.</p>
<h3>Swatow Disaster Relief Society's Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition Completed Successfully</h3>
<p>Most of the Calligraphy and Paintings Donated by This Newspaper Have Been Sold</p>
<p>The Swatow Disaster Relief Society held a charity calligraphy and painting exhibition for three days. The venue was provided free of charge by the Ningbo Association. Most of the exhibits were donated by the North China Emergency Relief Calligraphy and Painting Charity Exhibition organized by this newspaper. During the three-day exhibition period, more than 2,000 people visited, and sales amounted to about 80,000 yuan. The horizontal scroll "It is Most Joyful to Do Good" handwritten by the president of the society was purchased by Zhou Guoshi for 3,000 yuan. The Eighteen Provinces Scenic Map painted by elderly Wu Xingfen, originally valued at 30,000 yuan, was bidded up to 36,000 yuan by Chaozhou merchant Wang Longzhang. The money, after sending 6,000 yuan to the Shanghai charity organization, will be used for disaster relief in Swatow. The works of famous artists such as Mayor Chen, Minister Ding, Layman Ye, Xu Lang, Zhang Qihou, Tai Geng, Wang Chao, Wu Ou, Tian Zhouxiang, Feng Kai, Liu Jiao, Sheng Li Fangyuan, Jin Mengshi, Hong Shuan, Zha Haiju, Chen Tianxiao, and Xiao Kangshi were all sold.

The results of the charity exhibition were extremely satisfactory.</p>
<h3>First District Revision: Rules for Subleasing</h3>
<p>The First District Public Office, in order to revise the rules for subleasing house licenses, hereby issues a public notice stating: Upon investigation of the rules for subleasing house licenses, this office has decided to revise them starting from September 1st of this year, so as to make them applicable in a more appropriate manner, extending to shops, and not limited to residences. The revised articles are as follows: Article 3 (A) If the subleased house is used for business purposes, the profit obtained by the licensee shall not exceed 50% of the rent paid to the owner. As for the amount of house tax, license fee, water and electricity fees, and other expenses (if any) paid by the licensee, all shall be handled in accordance with the third article.</p>
<h3>Public Servants: No Exemption from Taxes</h3>
<p>The Datong News Agency reports, according to the "Times" newspaper, the "Times" reporter learned yesterday that the First District Public Office, in order to investigate any government offices or any individuals or cooperative warriors employed by the First District Public Office who evade the 10% surtax on lodging and meals and the 2% retail tax on goods, specially posted a notice yesterday to strictly prohibit such behavior. All are requested to pay attention. At the same time, it is hoped that all relevant personnel will report any violations of the law at any time. According to investigations, some staff members of the First District Public Office falsely claimed in hotels and restaurants that public servants have the right to tax exemption and refused to pay taxes. In fact, the scope of official tax exemption currently only refers to official use, and individual employees working in government offices do not have the right to tax exemption. Restaurants, cafes, etc., have been notified by the authorities that they should not allow any public servants to enjoy this special privilege in the future. Any individual who refuses to pay taxes by force should be taken to the public office immediately. This method also applies when paying the 2% retail tax on goods. Purchasers of official goods must hold official certificates before they are allowed tax exemption. This certificate must be left in the store after the purchase for the First District Public Office to review. Finally, it is clearly stated that the claim that employees employed by the First District Public Office and the National Government have the right to tax exemption is completely false.</p>
<h3>Graduation Exam for Summer Training Camp</h3>

Furthermore, in order to measure the thinking of each student, the camp specially gathered all the students at 7:40 PM yesterday (the 10th) by the training department to conduct a thinking test in groups based on the courses they were taking.</p>
<h3>Seeking Citizen Opinions on the Facilities of Greater Shanghai Municipality</h3>
<p>August 1st is the day when Shanghai's municipal administration becomes unified. The new construction of Greater Shanghai Municipality after this day is of great importance to Shanghai's future and the welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the direction of municipal administration deserves the attention of citizens. And the quality of facilities, before the establishment of a representative body, should be expressed by citizens with utmost sincerity. This newspaper is willing to fulfill its responsibility as the voice of the citizens and has specially opened a space to disclose citizen suggestions and reflect public opinion. It is planned to publish on the first day of each month, starting from September. All citizens who have opinions on the dynamics, advantages, disadvantages, progress, and regression of various aspects of municipal facilities should write them into text and send them to the editor's office of this newspaper before the 28th of the previous month (the deadline for submissions for September is the 28th of this month). We will compile and disclose them. If there is a need for confidentiality, we will also forward them to the municipal authorities for reference. However, the content of the text must be truthful and the description concise and to the point. Absolutely no empty talk is allowed. The real name must be written at the end of the article and the name signed. A pen name can be used during publication.

<h3>Office for Purchasing Yarn and Cloth Officially Established Yesterday; Chief and Deputy Chief Took Office Simultaneously</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the National General Association of Commerce, under orders to purchase cotton yarn and cotton cloth, has completed preparations for its office, which was officially established yesterday. The Director, Mr. Tu Lusheng, and the Deputy Director, Mr. Cao Boquan, repeatedly declined, but after repeated retention by Chairman Tang, they both arrived at the association at 10 AM yesterday (the 17th) to take office simultaneously. They are temporarily working at the association's address and are actively and carefully drafting a distribution plan for cotton yarn and cloth for implementation. All cotton yarn and cloth purchased from Chinese and Japanese merchants will be distributed uniformly and handled in the same way, without distinction.</p>
<p>Cloth Purchase Prices to be Decided in the Short Term</p>
<p>It was learned recently from relevant sources that the National Defense Council has only decided on the price of one type of cotton yarn for purchase, that is, 10,000 yuan per bundle of 20-count double-strand blue yarn. The prices of all other types of yarn and cloth have not yet been decided. However, there are more than a hundred types of yarn and cloth, and even within the same type, there are differences in quality. Therefore, the decision on purchase prices must be extremely thorough. Accordingly, the relevant authorities have now decided on a principle, that is, 10,000 yuan per bundle of 20-count blue phoenix yarn will be the standard for all types of cotton yarn, with increases or decreases accordingly. The yarn price will also be the standard for various cotton cloths to determine the amount of the purchase price. As for goods of inferior quality, prices will be determined separately to ensure fairness.

<h3>Shanghai West Police Bureau; Zhao Zhijia Succeeds as Director; Pan Da Promoted to Municipal Government Counselor</h3>
<p>Pan Da, Director of the Shanghai West Police Bureau, has been transferred to be a counselor of the Municipal Government. The vacancy has been filled by the Municipal Government appointing Ji Zhijia to take over. The transfer ceremony was held on the 17th. After the new Director Zhao took office, he immediately spoke to the police officers, encouraging them to work harder and provide better service. He said that he would abide by the Mayor's instructions and try to improve their treatment. He also hoped that they would carry forward the spirit of the police and create well-being for the people of Shanghai West. It is also heard that Director Zhao is a graduate of the police academy and has served in the police force in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Beijing, and Shanghai for a long time. After returning to the capital, he successively served as the Director of the Police Affairs Department of the Ministry of Police Administration, Deputy Director-General of the Police Administration Department of the Ministry of Interior, and Director of the Police Affairs Department. He has written many police books.</p>
<p>Pan Da Publishes on His Handling of Police Affairs in Shanghai West</p>
<p>Since Pan Da, Director of the Shanghai West Police Bureau, has been in charge of police affairs in Shanghai West for two and a half years, he has achieved remarkable results. Shanghai West was once known as a "den of thieves," but now it has become a paradise. Now Mr. Pan has been promoted to the position of Senior Counselor of the Municipal Government of this city. It is learned that Mr. Pan studied political economy at St. John's University twenty years ago and was highly regarded by President Bu Fangqian. After leaving school, he served as an accountant and held important positions in the business community, and also served as a special policeman in the Public Concession for more than ten years. He is talented in both literary and military affairs and is good at making quick decisions. He has now resigned from his police duties and is fully engaged as a counselor to the Municipal Government. The reporter visited him and received the following statement:</p>
<p>The Bad Name of "Den of Thieves" is Eliminated</p>
<p>I have always studied political economy and also liked to study police affairs. Before the incident, I served as a special policeman in the Public Concession for more than ten years and have some knowledge of police affairs. On February 1, 1941, the Nanj Government and the Public Concession signed the Shanghai Four Special Police Agreement, establishing the Shanghai West Special Police Headquarters, which was the beginning of China's recovery of extraterritorial police power. I was appointed Director of the Headquarters by Mayor Chen and with the love of friendly countries. At that time, the Shanghai West area was extremely chaotic, with opium dens lining the streets and bandits robbing in broad daylight. With the guidance of Yongchangguan and the efforts of all police officers, all the evils in the area were almost completely eliminated within a few months. Citizens were able to live and work in peace, and the bad name of "den of thieves" in Shanghai West was eliminated from then on. In addition, household surveys, the holding of flat rice, the mediation of factory unrest, and the implementation of price controls were all carried out diligently. At that time, there were specialists of Chinese, British, and Japanese nationalities in the Headquarters. Through timely adjustments, they were able to cooperate with each other and smoothly implement policies.</p>
<p>The Security of Shanghai West is More Established</p>
<p>On May 1, 1942, the agreement to abolish extraterritorial road rights in Shanghai West was officially abolished and completely recovered, which was the prelude to the recovery of the concession. The Shanghai West Special Police Headquarters was reorganized into the Shanghai Special Municipality Shanghai Four Police Bureau, and I have been the director to this day for more than a year. During this period, the security of Shanghai West has been further established. In addition to requiring police officers to perform their duties diligently, I have also encouraged them to study, established libraries, and opened sports fields to cultivate their body and mind. Currently, most of the officials are graduates of police academies or have received special training. Even the lower-level male and female police officers are often trained and have considerable knowledge of academic and technical subjects. All police officers can perform their duties honestly and with integrity and serve the country and the people. Now that the concessions have been recovered and the administrative power of the entire city of Shanghai is completely unified, the transitional mechanism set up to recover extraterritorial police power should be withdrawn. I can now relieve myself of my responsibilities and avoid mistakes. I am even more fortunate to be able to serve at the Mayor's side and seek to improve my knowledge. Although I dare not say that I will achieve success and reward, I can be pleased. However, I have served in Shanghai West for more than two years and have been spared any major mistakes. This is due to the tolerance of my superiors, the assistance of friendly countries, the understanding of the people, and the encouragement of friends. Therefore, I will never forget my gratitude.</p>

<p>Translation and Commentary</p>
<h3>The Premise for Strengthening Production Activities</h3>
<p>Since the authorities' management committee abolished speculation, the floating capital in the market has been moving towards normal channels. Especially after the recent forceful implementation of suppressing prices and cracking down on hoarding, the powerful elements in the financial world are trying to induce floating capital into the production sector, which presents a significant phenomenon. This situation naturally needs to be nurtured and developed.</p>
<p>After the decision to purchase cotton yarn and cotton cloth, a great impetus was given to the economic sector. As far as individual enterprises are concerned, it may have been hit, but as far as the entire production activity of Shanghai is concerned, it is undoubtedly sufficient to expand it.</p>
<p>Since the strengthening of production activities is the key to economic recovery, the authorities should remove old difficulties and strive to achieve it. Everything related to the transportation of raw materials, the supply of power and labor, and the guarantee of sales should be facilitated as much as possible. Sufficient financial assistance is also extremely important. If the proper conditions are met, active assistance should be provided. This is the most effective method to stimulate production and also contains the effect of promoting lower prices. Its impact is very large.</p>
<p>The most important thing to promote production activities is to guarantee the safety of capital. At the same time, the state of psychological anxiety must also be eradicated. How to ensure the safety of capital depends on the authorities collecting practical opinions, conducting sincere discussions, and establishing concrete measures. In addition, the Japanese side should actively support and provide loyal advice to the fundamental policy of economic recovery in Central China to achieve its mission. (Abridged translation from the Continental New Daily, August 17)</p>
<h3>Materials Investigation Committee to Hold Three Meetings; Will Continue to Investigate Other Hoarded Materials</h3>
<p>The Materials Investigation Committee is investigating hoarded materials in this city. The first step is to investigate cotton yarn and cloth. After the Chinese and Japanese investigators led investigators to complete the investigation of the cotton yarn and cloth stored in 233 public warehouses in the first, eighth districts, they continued to investigate the yarn and cloth stored in 70 private warehouses. It is estimated that all investigations can be completed within this week. At the same time, they are also reviewing the investigation reports of the investigators. When unregistered cotton yarn and cloth are found, they will be reported to the competent authorities for disposal. It is reported that the committee has now scheduled to hold a third official report meeting on the 20th of this month to report the investigation results and put them to discussion. In addition, they will discuss further investigation work. As for other materials...</p>
<h3>Procedures for Applying for Transfer of Materials from Three Provinces and Two Cities</h3>
<p>When important materials are transferred from the three provinces and two cities to other regions, it is necessary to first apply for a transfer permit from the local competent authorities, and then apply to the Approval Affairs Group of the General Association of Commerce for the issuance of a transfer approval certificate based on the permit. However, the association only issues transfer approval certificates to shippers who have joined the local trade association as members. Otherwise, it will not be approved. Recently, in order to make it clear to merchants and residents in various places regarding this application procedure, the General Association of Commerce has transferred the administrative Yuan to the North China Political Affairs Committee and the provincial and municipal governments and special district administrative offices outside the three provinces and cities, respectively, and instructed the competent authorities to inform the applicants of this requirement when applying for transfer permits, so as to avoid complications.</p>
<h3>Newly Established Insurance Companies Not Allowed to Register</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Insurance Management Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, most of the insurance companies in this city have applied for approval to operate. There are still many that are being reviewed. However, there are still companies that operate insurance businesses that have been recently established. According to the Insurance Interpretation of the Ministry of Industry, these newly established insurance companies are all those that have completed the registration procedures before the deadline. Those established after December 28, 1942, will not be allowed to register.</p>
<h3>Funds to Support Various Industries from Bank Associations; Central Reserve Bank Agrees to Provide</h3>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank and the Bank United Reserve Committee and the Money Industry United Reserve Bank are adjusting the funds of the industry and stabilizing the market. They agree to supply funds to manage lending and maintain the industry. The entire financial situation has become stable. The shortage of funds is not as tight as in the past. Small banks have been adjusted and have become stable. Therefore, in addition to the shutdown of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Enterprise Bank, other companies have not suffered unfortunate incidents. Yesterday, it was learned that in order to consolidate their own foundations, each bank and association has reviewed the issue of loans and strictly followed the three restrictions issued by the Ministry of Finance and the new loan method passed by the silver and money industries. The mortgage loans for goods have been particularly tightened. Food, yarn, cloth, and daily necessities are completely rejected. They will try their best to reduce credit loans. However, if each industry needs funds for the development of livelihood projects, the bank and association will still approve the loan as appropriate and set the maximum loan amount based on the actual situation of each industry. As for the funds needed by each bank and association to support each industry, they will be supplied by the Central Reserve Bank and then loaned by the bank and association to each industry. It is said that the interest rate is lower than usual. The bank and association that receive the funds supplied by the Central Reserve Bank must report the loans they handle to the Central Reserve Bank for inspection.</p>
<h3>Rationing of Matches Still Pending Approval</h3>
<p>The matter of rationing matches in this city, by the association, is said to have come to a conclusion. The total number of households in the city and the amount of allocation have been meticulously calculated. Generally, the allocation amount per period is usually around 1,000 cases. It is currently being submitted to the Commerce and Trade Control Board for approval. Once approved, it will be implemented. Therefore, the black market price of matches imported from Japan has been plummeting drastically.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Gold and Silver: Gold ornaments are still not being exchanged in gold and silver shops. The price for foreign transactions fluctuates inside and outside the customs area, causing uncertainty. It initially rose within the customs area in the morning, but returned by midday, with a slight overall increase compared to yesterday. Taels of fine silver are at the small customs area.</p>
<p>Public Bonds: Unified public bonds are slightly recovering in the market. Types A, B, and C are outside the 19th customs area, Type D is at 18, and Type C is above 23. All bonds have increased by several yuan.</p>
<p>Rice: The food market in Shanghai is declining, and households are mostly selling off their stocks, making the situation slightly flat and sluggish. Du rice has fallen to the 19th customs area, general rice is around the 9th customs area, soybean cakes have fallen by more than ten, and other items have also fallen.</p>
<h3>Trend of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday's decline initially weakened before suddenly rebounding around noon, a change that was unexpected. Initially affected by selling pressure, it was later absorbed by investors taking advantage of low prices. New accounts were actively buying, pushing the price up in the afternoon. The decline from the noon break was almost entirely recovered. Various speculations and rumors resurfaced, and morale in all quarters turned upward again. New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory of the New Pharmaceutical Industry first broke into the 100 customs area, but was forcefully pushed out of the customs area by powerful accounts at noon, although it was still slightly lower than the noon price of the previous day. China-France rebounded after breaking the 7 customs area, and Xinyi also experienced a slight increase overall. New Star remained within the 3 customs area, Scientific Chemical had few transactions, and Xinxin of the department store industry returned to the 4 customs area significantly. This was likely due to the rapid rise over the past two days, with share prices already high after subscription, leading to profit-taking. Wing On and China Emporium each saw small declines of dozens. In Chinese Underwear, there were many sellers within the white customs area. Jingfu shirts saw prices enter within the 4th Pavilion, with brisk trading. The market had turned firm by noon. Jinglun continued to decline slightly, within one or two customs areas. Guan An Department Store opened at half a hundred. Wing On Textile Factory of the weaving industry saw the most severe decline, falling to the 14 customs area. Although it stabilized later, it still experienced a small decline of half a hundred. Wuhe traded outside the 4 customs area. Hongsheng and Great China Weaving both saw rebounds. Other stocks, including Jiaxin, Guoxin, and Xinfeng, also recovered later. Great China Matches retreated into the 4 customs area. Nanyang Tobacco Company stabilized at the 6 customs area at noon. Zhabei Water and Electricity of the public utility sector saw small fluctuations of dozens. China Merchants Electric Company reported firmness, and Public Utilities Motor Company maintained a stable trend. The prices of Commercial Press and World Book Company of the cultural industry remained flat. China Bookstore retreated to the 1000 customs area. Yongxiang Printing and Dying, Jinling Paper Mill, Standard Paper Products all traded above the previous day's price. Jiu An Real Estate opened at 7 customs, Xinghua and Great China Industry, Gujin, and New Asia Construction recovered after falling, Xin Yi and Lianhua Real Estate were ultimately similar to the noon price of the previous day.

<p>Hong Kong shirts, yellow shorts, sunglasses, yellow "leather" wallets, white "leather" shoes, painted toenails, revealed in the openwork places,</p>
<p>colors, yellow, green, blue, white, an eye-dazzling sight….</p>
<p>Thunderous cars drive by, and the scorching wind can't remove the emerging sweaty smell.</p>
<p>Watermelon sellers show off their tricks</p>
<p>"No sweetness, no money, hey… one copper coin buys a piece! Hey!…"</p>

<h3>Bugle</h3>
<p>— Lan Yi</p>
<p>Midsummer Night!</p>
<p>Shooting stars fly out of the Milky Way;</p>
<p>Casting a coquettish smile. I caress the tarnished,</p>
<p>The copper-green bugle,</p>
<p>And again stirs up undulating emotional ripples, profound and distant thoughts!</p>
<p>I vaguely recall the drawn-out sounds in the dawn breeze.</p>
<p>The heroic bugle sounds,</p>
<p>When will the heroic sound that welcomes dawn be blown again?</p>
<p>Confined in the shed, the rusty bugle!</p>

<h3>Comfort</h3>
<p>— Liang Meng</p>
<p>Everyone needs comfort, especially young people who are wandering in pain.</p>
<p>If one blindly pursues comfort and indulges in it, comfort will become a insidious enemy.</p>
<p>People need love, but if one is merely drunk in this circle, regret will follow.</p>
<p>Comfort must be transformed into encouragement, driving people to strive for success.</p>
<h3>Summer Night Chat about Cicadas</h3>
<p>— Xu Huiguang</p>
<p>Spring breeze and peach blossoms, autumn rain and梧桐 trees. Every season, nature deliberately renders it without the slightest carelessness; what adorns summer is the sound of cicadas chirping loudly in the green trees:</p>
<p>The gradually increasing temperature on the thermometer, coupled with the cacophonous cicada sounds outside the window, gives people a feeling of heat. What makes me more cordial is the joy of playing in my childhood. Listening to the cicada sounds, I think of my younger brother in my hometown or my companions, holding long bamboo poles, and sweating while catching cicadas!</p>
<p>Three or four weeks later, carrying a book, I returned to the dormitory to sleep. The light in the room was dim. The windows were all open. The moonlight outside the window was like water, and the sparse shadows of willow trees swayed on the white walls. Several friends were lying on the bed, talking about everything under the sun. I turned on the light.</p>
<p>"Swish…!" With a sound, suddenly a cicada flew in from outside the window, circling the light, flying and bumping around.</p>
<p>"Thud!" With a sound, it fell from the wall to the ground. I hurried over to catch it.</p>
<p>"Zhila…," the cicada vibrated its thin wings, and my heart was filled with joy.</p>
<p>"Let it go!" Humanitarianism and the selfishness of childhood intertwined in my heart, making me hesitate.</p>
<p>My friends seemed very happy too. Talking shifted to the cicada, most of them advocating letting it go. So I stretched my hand out the window and threw it into the sky.</p>
<p>"Swish…!" The cicada still flew in from outside the window, circling the light, flying and bumping around, and finally fell to the ground again. Releasing it and it flying back in happened three times in a row. Finally, I turned off the light and let it go. Lying in bed, thinking about this little animal's love of light, I tossed and turned and couldn't fall asleep.</p>
<p>Loving light is the nature of most animals. Even the slightest like bees and flies, the scene of them flying around on glass windows makes people feel moved! Cicadas love light, but because of blindly pursuing it, they are more likely to be destroyed. Children take advantage of their weakness of blindly pursuing light, tying a circular wire ring to the long bamboo pole for catching cicadas, attaching a cone-shaped paper bag to the wire ring, and cutting off some of the tip of the bag with scissors, revealing a small hole to let in light. When the paper bag covers the cicada, the cicada feels darkness and rushes to the light, entering the tip of the bag, and it is trapped in the small tip of the bag, being caught with "no place to display its heroism."</p>
<p>Seeing cicadas makes me think of moths. Although people have different opinions, these little lives pursuing light, the spirit of sacrificing themselves and stepping into fire without hesitation, is enough to move people!</p>
