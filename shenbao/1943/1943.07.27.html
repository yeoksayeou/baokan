<h3>新生上海之建設與人材問題</h3>
<p>自上海公共租界交還有期以後，法義接踵而起與我國簽訂協定，交還上海和界行政權，租界二字不久將成爲歷史上的名詞。『租界』二字木很費解，租期若有若無，界限似定未定，而租戶之發號施令儼若業主，此誠中外所未聞，古今所未有。在中國　個有機體中，有此畸形機構之寄生，足以妨碍健全與發展，毫無疑義。故自巴黎和會以來，中國朝野上下，莫不以『收回』租界爲急務。但『二十五年』中始終不能實現，而自日本實施對華新政策至今，僅『半年』之間，所有上海租界均由各方面自動『交還』，使大上海全部之行政權復歸統一。就『收回』與『交還』兩名詞意義之對照，再就『二十五年』與『半年』兩時問久暫之比較，吾人不能不感到一則以喜一則以懼。在建設新生上海之總綱下，覺得應該而値得討論的問題，千頭萬緒，請以一則以懼的態度，再談人材問題。</p>
<p>本報七月六日社評中，已就新生上海之建設與民意機關，有所論列，復於二十日社評加以補充，正所以期望上海市民方面在歡騰鼓舞之餘，不忘協助政府之責任，應當嚴密組織，澈底硏討，準備提供方案之資料，並培養需督實施之能力。以各界公正廉明識高見遠人士，組成政府與民衆連繫之一環。在政府方面固當盡量俯從民意採納輿情，同時更需要將各方而片段的主張，彙成有系統的計劃，在一貫的國策之下，切實加以推進。誠如六月二十七日東京朝日新聞所論，『……租界接收後，向由英美獨佔的行政機關工部局，勢必同時取消，新設以中國人爲長的上海特別市政府管轄的區公所，上海特別市政府將爲上海最高的行政官廳。……』（見本報七月六日時論選譯　。按當時僅就公共租界立論。）可是要完成這區公所和這最高行政官廳的使命，空言無補，其需要人材之急迫，實非楮墨所能形容。而此時此地特別値得注意者，得分論於后：</p>
<p>（一）租界存在，有百年之歷史。在此百年中，就正的方面說，上海由沙灘而變爲都市，且成爲經濟文化的重心，其盛衰洽亂，不特影響中國，抑且影響到整個東亞各部分之榮枯消長。就負的方面說，上海雖屬中國版圖，租界原非割讓，可是中國行政權久不能及於租界，使之形成化外，而包羅形形色色不合於中國國情之產物，適足以影響到中國經濟文化以及政治上之正常發展。所以治理整個大上海之最高行政官廳，以及區公所之長官和僚屬，其使命不但要維持和增進上海租界的地位，並且要給以新的生命，使之回復光明，成爲模範都市。將來全國景從，風氣轉變，影響至大。故此時此地所需要之人村，不僅限於技術專長，而且須具有任勞任怨不辭艱難之風格。否則不能勝任愉快，甚致陷於不可收拾之境地。</p>
<p>（二）自國府還都以來，所最感困難者，厭爲人材之缺乏，此爲無可諱言之事實。平心而論，眞正堪稱人村而無愧者，在中國本是鳳毛麟角，不可多覯。乃復不能集中於同一旗幟之下，彼此合作，或分散各地，各抱獨善其身之主義，不求開達於當時。究其原因，則政府亦有不能辭咎之處。要知民之歸仁，如水就下。還都三年餘，其所創導之政策，固求　不爲國計民生着想，且締迭艱難，經營慘淡，人民應知上體政府之苦衷，外察國際之大勢，各凛匹夫有責之訓，盡共所能，以貢獻於國家。可是全而和平之局面未成，而割據之風已長，經濟政策之效果未收，而民不聊生之象已著，淸斯濯纓濁斯濯足，求才之難，其微妙在此。今也取消租界，百年之恥以雪，百年之願以償，人同此心，心同此理，誰不以此爲國府還都後最大成就，亦卽强化國府之初步階段，苟能利用此劃時代之機會，先就接收租界之機關，完全採取人材主義，澈底刷新，以正國際之視聽，以增民衆之信頓，則往者不可諫，來者猶可追，草上之風，立遍宇內，人材匯合，將有不遠千里而來者，故此時此地需要人村之影響，不僅限於新生上海之建設，且波及整個機構之命運。倘一再磋跎，時不我再，强化國府之機會，稍縱可逝。</p>
<p>（三）人材之條件如彼，人材之重要如此，加之兩租界工部局原有之組織，分門別類龐大無倫，欲能適應質量兩方面之需要，必須對於禮聘及培養雙方兼顧。世之言人材者，每重於學而忽於品，殊不知眞正之人材，必有其耿介拔俗之修養，寗簞食瓢飲於窮巷陋室，而不顧同流合汚以取媚於當時。遇千鈞一髮之際，或能挺身而出以寄重任，固不能以利成誘脅，亦不能招之使來，揮之使去。無欲則剛，並無矯揉做作之故意。求賢選材之明主，莫不卑躬下士者，原因在此。倘自以和平先進自居，傲慢流露於不知不覺之中，則拒人於千里之外，殊非禮聘之道。此外，求材不可過苛，資效不宜過急。須知品重於學，有學而品格卑下者，祗是高等病棍，僨事有餘，成事不足。反之品格高超，僅有一技之長者，亦當多方延攬，位置適當，俾得發抓共本能。且租界本身歷史悠久，一旦厠身其間，須先加以觀察，擬定方案，逐步推進，則成效自能漸著。若考績不按事實之程序，反致欲速不達，而摧殘可造之才，殊非培養之道。禮聘與培養相輔而用，則材無高下，必能兼收並蓄，由此新陳代謝，使新生上海之建設工作，日益燦爛，內可以取信國人，外可以昭示國際。吾人復興中華保衛東亞之實際能力，能否表現，在此一舉。</p>
<p>總之，接收上海租界之責任愈大，建設新生上海之工作愈煩，則人材問題　感重要。偶有疏忽，必致取櫝還珠，騰笑四海，其何以對友邦而謝國人。謹以愼始之誠，聊　芻言。</p>

<h3>日外務省召集會議　研討應付時局對策　外相令駐南歐使節　採取臨機應變措置</h3>
<p>東京廿六日中央社電　日重光外相自就任以來，對於日　緊迫之世界戰局之推移，頗爲關注，並愼重應付。尤其　五月十三日突尼西亞戰事結束後，反軸心軍企圖在地中海反攻，及其非法轟炸義國之　經攻擊等結果，更爲重視。乃於十日乘反軸心軍進攻西西里島之國，向駐南歐洲使臣發出電令，着刻從速採取臨幾應變之措置，以期對完成軸心不敗之體勢，能毫無遺憾。日外務省復根據此旨　，前曾於廿一日任有田。山川兩氏爲顧問，使其參劃推進戰時外交之戰，務期以衆智運營必勝之外務，除已於廿四日舉行首次會議外，復於廿六日下午二時舉有第二次會議。重光外相此次特對歐洲戰局之歸趨，採取應付其不斷變化之方策者殊値注目。</p>
<h3>秉政二十一年　墨索裏尼辭職　義大利國王親任三軍統師　首相一職由巴特裏奧繼任</h3>
<p>里斯本二寸六日中央社電　羅馬廣播電台於昨夜十一時（羅馬時間）宣佈：秉政二十一年之義人利首相墨索里尼氏已辭職義王愛麥虞限已接管義軍之最高指揮權。</p>
<p>羅馬廿六日中央社電　義大利官方通訊社史蒂芬尼社於特別公報中宣佈：義大利國王已接受首相墨索里尼之辭呈，義王愛麥虞限巳任命巴特里奧元帥，繼墨索里尼爲義大利政府首相兼國務大臣。羅馬方面人士料想義政府之更　，乃因義首相最近政躬違和之故。</p>
<p>義王勉人民效忠</p>
<p>羅馬廿六日中央社電據史蒂芬尼社訊：義王愛麥處限三世頃向全國國民發出如下宣告書：　自即日起担任義大利軍最高統帥當此祖國情形嚴重之　，凡我國民均應各盡其責，各就本位努力，效忠國家，貧不許稍忝厥職與義務，凡我國家均　充分明瞭祖國聖土巳遭受莫大創傷，義國惟有以武裝兵力之奮鬥，與義國國民之決意，協助國家臻於建設復興，朕欲與舉國上下共保祖國，本於　　　國永生之不　信念，團結一致携手邁進。</p>
<p>新首相就職宣言</p>
<p>羅馬廿六日中央社電新任義大利政府首揆巴特里奧元帥於就職後，力申義大利將對反軸心國繼續作戰，巴元帥於今日發表公告如下；　余奉國王之命，接管本國之軍事政府一賦有全權，今後戰事將繼續進行。義大利在其被侵犯各省及被毀之城市內，所受打擊固甚重人，惟爲保持其千年之傳統起見，義大利將實踐其諾言。汝等當羣集於國王之四周。國王爲祖國之模範，亦足爲汝等全體之矜式，余之命令明白簡潔，必須切實奉行，凡敢阻撓者實爲自受其愚，任何人企圖騷擾惑亂民心者，將受嚴厲之處罰。</p>
<p>巴特裏奧略歷</p>
<p>中央社　義新首相巴特里奧元帥，現年七十二歲，生於批埃特蒙省之格拉柴諾地方。一八九〇年畢業於特利克陸軍軍官學校，於一八九六年至一八九七年曾參加埃立特里安戰役，又于一九一一年至一九一二年參加特利波里戰役，在第一次世界大戰時，任義大利第二軍之參謀職，旋即統率第二與第二十七軍團，於一九一七年秋季即被任命爲義總參謀部副部長，休戰後，府一九一九年起，即爲參議員，先後就任政府高級專員，駐羅馬尼亞公使。與駐美國公使。及駐巴西大使。一九二五年升任元帥，就陸軍總參謀長職，旋即被任爲總參謀部部長之職。於一九二八年至一九三三年任里比亞總督，又任義屬東非總司令，於五個月中征服阿比西尼亞，即任該處之總督，受動爲阿狄斯阿巴巴公爵，於一九四〇年十二月六日辭去義軍總參謀部長職。</p>
<h3>義大利宣布　全國戒嚴</h3>

<h3>西班牙召集　緊急閣議</h3>
<p>里斯本二十六日中央社電　據馬德里來電：西班牙政府於二十五日深夜曾召開緊急閣議。</p>
<h3>土耳其採取　愼重態度</h3>
<p>斯丹埠廿六日中央社電　當此四西里烏戰事進行之際，英美軍實有於巴爾幹及東地中海方面實行侵略之可能，故土耳其對此極爲關懷，惟土耳其對此所採擇之態度，現未正式表明。土耳其各報每日均撰文，假如有此萬一情勢時，土耳其所取之態度爲如何，但其取材及措詞則極爲愼重。但由於英美在土耳其所設之情報機關，其規模與組織遠較軸心方面爲大，故反軸心方面之戰事消息較多，然土政府深知倘如取捨欠當，必將召禍，故一律不用交戰國之宣傳，而報紙之檢查亦沿此方針實施，觀諸土耳其政府之愼重態度，實有將永久維持中立之可能，據土耳其外交方面傳出之消息稱，英美刻已質問土政府有無允許英美利用土耳其港灣　施之意，與美艦艇得駛入土耳其港灣內修理，以及英美軍得於上國，境內設置，軍需品囤積廠等項問題，傳土政府已將此項要求置之不　。惟土耳其更深知英美於西西里戰勝後，即將加重對土之壓迫，故土耳其自於英美軍在四四裏島登陸後，即已採取更進一步之愼重態度。</p>
<h3>日機迎擊美駐渝空軍　衡陽上空發生空戰　擊落美機念八架並炸燬軍事設施數處　日空軍先發制人遏止渝方美空軍蠢動</h3>
<p>東京廿六日中央社電　日大本營廿六日下午三時三十分發表，日航空部隊於七月廿三日，廿四日，廿五日三日間，繼續轟炸駐渝美空軍之前進基地衡陽，零陵，寳際，芷扛，建甌各飛機塲，炸　各該機塲之滑行路及其附屬設施，使蒙重大損害。並在衡陽零陵及桂林附近擊落敵機二十八架，日方自炸八架。又據日軍某基地二十六日電，日陸軍航空部隊精銳曾於二十三日及二十五日上午以戰鬥機轟炸機連合大編隊急轉湖南省衡陽三次，予美駐湔空軍以極大打擊。二十五日下午復以戰鬥機强襲衡陽，曁日高速度戰鬥機隊是日出發充　擊滅美空軍之鬥志，及至衡陽上空，即發現美機卡蒂斯（P40）型及羅基特（P38）型機十餘架，遂即展開壯烈空戰，擊落敵（P40）型機三架，（P38）型機一架，其殘餘即愴惶一遁走，日機全體高奏凱歌悠悠返還。按（P38）型機乃美空軍誇耀之雙發動戰鬥機，過去屢屢使用偵察及出擊云。</p>
<p>東京二十六日中央一社電　據此間軍事專家稱：敵軍在南太平洋開始總反攻以來，所羅門羣島新佐治亞島方面，日美雙方所展開之海陸空立體決戰，極爲激烈，當此之時，日陸軍機又不斷猛擊以渝方各地爲基地而企岡空　日本本地之美空軍，粉碎敵基地設施，擊落敵精銳機二十八架，此項戰果，巳由日大本營於二十六日發表。敵軍認爲以渝機塲爲基地空襲日本土在戰略上，最爲有效，故雖屬遭日空軍不斷襲擊，仍謀捲土重來，故常利用僅有數百噸之空運能力，由渝印空路不斷從事供給。聞最近其空軍情勢，業已整備，故漸有與南太平洋敵軍之反攻作戰相呼應，而有開始蠢動之勢，即派機偵察和平地區各要衝，並盲炸越南以展開空中猛擊戰。惟日駐華陸軍航空部隊對敵軍之蠢動，早已嚴密監視，且認時機不可失，乃於二十三，二十四，二十五，連續以精銳機編隊，猛炸美空軍之前綫基地，衡陽零陵寳慶芷江建甌及桂林等地飛機塲，重創各該地機塲滑走路及各種設施，並擊落敵戰鬥機P一四〇型二十八架，重創地上敵機若干架，澈底千敵在渝空軍前綫基地以莫大　擊，因此日空軍此種先發制人之攻擊，乃將敵之反攻企圖，完全粉碎。</p>
<h3>新佐治亞島附近　敵艦艇五艘炸沉　大島島空戰毀敵機三架　美巴克納中將傳已陣亡</h3>
<p>昭南二十六中央社電　據日軍某基地電：日海軍水上機隊以敵艦艇數艘，竟企圖在新佐治亞島克拉灣方而登陸，並於七月二十三日夜侵入該灣，故當即出動猛炸，並創敵驅逐艦及運輸船各一艘，且於　晚發敵現雷魚艇在新佐治亞島西北方基索島北方海面企圖蠢動，常時亦即出動猛炸，結果又擊沉敵艦艇三艘。</p>
<p>里斯本廿六日中央社電　據新金山電，西南太平洋反軸心軍司令部廿五日發表：日軍航空部隊二十四日復曾轟炸新佐　亞島培那培那美軍陣地，及厄諾蓋灣之反軸心軍。</p>
<p>南京二十六日中央社電　據日軍某基地二十五日電：二十五日晨有敵統一式（B24）型重轟炸機八架來襲日軍佔領下之大島島（又名威克島），日機當即起飛迎擊，與敵機展開熾烈空戰，旋擊落敵機二架，並擊毀其一架，餘機見勢不佳，即倉島遁走，聞被擊落敵機中有一架，係由日機衝擊而隨落者，是役日文有飛機二架自炸。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城廿六日中央社電　據華盛頓電傳：美陸軍中將巴克納已於四南太平洋方面陣亡。</p>
<p>日軍擅長業林作戰</p>
<p>日內瓦日中央社電新喬治亞美軍中之「每日郵報」隨軍記者，爲文詳述美軍在太平洋各島叢林中作戰之苦况，渠稱，「叢林本身即爲最一大之敵人，士兵常須涉渡深及胸際之泥汚，且須應付各種危險，吾人之士兵不慣於此種環境，故在在夜間允感可怖，而使神經非常緊張，彼等日夜售未能休息，僅年事較輕之人方能忍受此種艱苦，吾人之敵人則絕不如此，日軍在短時間內即能適應，且對於叢林戰爭似曾受優良之訓練，彼等對於僞飾極爲擅長，此項本能非美兵　有」云。</p>
<h3>出席興亞大會代表　昨謁主席請訓　主席賜見后訓勉有加</h3>

<h3>日本第四屆　中央協力會議經過</h3>
<p>以完遂決戰生產及實　決戰生活爲二大日標的大政取贊會第四屆中央協力會議，於十四日上午九時在大東亞會　舉行，歷時三日，於十六日下午六時左右閉會。茲將經過情形絲述於後：</p>
<p>於九時〇五分在大束亞會館四樓會塲舉行開幕式，由小林海軍大將爲議長，　從　方前綫歸國的東條首相，全體閣員及該會職員議員共二百十六名均全體出席，行禮如儀，小林議長捧　詔書後，七十四歲的今井浩三翁（香川縣議會）代表全體議員宜誓。誓畢，即由束條首相致辭，披瀝政府決意，要求國民協力（演詞見七月十五日本報）。繼由小林議長致辭，選擇代表，至陸海軍省傳達申謝日軍之意，其後，由鈴木企劃院總裁演說政政的各種重要施策，决由天羽情報局總裁演說內外情勢，（詞均見七月十五日本報）丸山事務總長報告翼贊會狀况。自十一時起，開始討論，高田元三郞氏（每日新聞社總編輯）首先發言，依决發言之議員達三十六名，正午暫告休息。</p>
<p>午後一時，會議重開，先由代表簡單報告至陸　軍省傳達感謝決議之結果後，即繼續由議員發言討論，關於官民協力，革新教育，國民動員，企業整備，科學技術，重點運輸，食糧增產，決戰生活，健民運動等諸問題，各界各地代表充分表明了戰時國民的決心。午後八時左右散會。</p>
<p>茲將第一日的經過情形記之於　：</p>
<p>第一天會朧發言的中心，集中於勞務關係及學生動員問題。蓋日本在自前的情勢下，增强戰力上勞力的補充實爲急務。爲完途決戰生產，不論男女，應一致振作勤勞精神。產業報國會理事長小畑忠良氏主張設置國家的產業預備隊，這產業預備隊有二種：一·　爲保持勞　者數量的預備隊·二·爲適應特殊技能的預備隊，當組撤時，希望各優秀工廠，予以犧牲的協力。</p>
<p>關於物資問題，產業報國會實踐局長町田辰决郎氏稱：增强生產的困難之一因，爲生活必需物資不能滿足個人的最低限度之要求。從事生產的勞働者與生產有密切的關係，故必須實施配給，鑒於物資的不足，一般地應較民需爲先，個別地配給生活必須物資於勞働者，對靑少年勞働者，因其爲國力的根柢，特別注意於營養，以昂揚增强生產的意識。</p>
<p>此次的企業整備，與食糧問題同爲日本當前最大的問題，在第一天會議上，頗有値得傾聽的意見。屬於第一種工業部門的織物業組合長酒井伊四郎氏希望在第一種工業部門中對操業，保有，轉用，廢止四種有緊急的舉措。猪飼博氏主張從速將主要產業關係工廠移歸國家管理，以强權命令擴充生　，同時必須請求有效適切的方策。</p>
<p>屬于第二種工業部門的三美製作所長後　迫太氏，指摘政府對于轉換工塲之有計劃的利用從無適切的指導方針，一任商人直接交易，致價格發生不正當的騰貴，而阻害增强生產。又入山採煤所長中村豐氏主張一·全國煤礦應加以整理，二·整理時應分別各地城各煤礦而計　之，三·先從對迅速增强戰力有所貢獻的地方着手以上所述諸間題，從增强戰力的見地上看來，爲不容或緩的緊急問題，頗堪注目。</p>
<p>關於確保國民食糧的國內自給問題，亦有種種値得注意的言論。各議員均從長期間親身所獲的經騐，就現狀加以論列，强調今日增產的中心除生產資材的不足外，在於人的問題。唯有　揚他們的責任意識，始能突破難關。決戰時期確保食糧問題之癥結的所在，充分加以闡釋。</p>
<p>米穀的供出，討論最多，高橋英夫氏（　壯本部長）強調耕田的種植與供出比例的關係，一切資材的配給，應又共供出成績爲根據。今井梧樓氏（岡谷市長）根據日本農民的帳册而聲述責任生產的必要。</p>
<p>朝倉昭郎氏（翼壯總務）聲述因勞力不足，在個人的責任上，欲完遂其所擔任的比例，頗爲困難，以農村五人組爲最下部責任者最爲妥當。</p>
<p>大內竹之助氏（日立水泥社長）論述增產的最後階段爲農民問題的解決，故主張斷然實行農地的國家管理，强行耕地的使用統制，與土地利用的高度化同對確立日本農村有鉅大貢獻。</p>
<p>最後，靑山憲三氏（代議士）閘釋水產物爲國民的營養之源極爲緊要，故國家表彰及遭難漁民的慰祭實有必要。而漁民保險現行漁船保險的確立及擴充亦爲獎勵漁業上的急務，這些經費常然應由國庫負擔。（異）</p>
<h3>德軍在東綫　使用「重心砲」　威力強大足又左右戰局　奧勒爾區劇戰仍進行中</h3>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電德軍於東綫使用强火力之新兵器「重心砲」，已數傳於外。茲葛羅大佐二十五日於德軍機關雜誌中初次述明該新式武器之全貌，茲特錄於：此新武器威力之强大，實可左右戰局，使之有利於己方，故名之爲重心砲。此砲火力之强烈與體質之輕便爲其特徵，砲身裝有彈禽六個，相當曲射砲六門之火力，彈倉係以輕鋼鐵製成，以電力操持，數秒間可發射砲彈六枚，該砲彈係因使用無烟火藥，故放射時不留任何痕跡。由此砲火射之砲彈，概分三種，第一種爲榴彈，此種砲彈之爆炸力極强，故敵兵因被震傷內部出血而死亡甚多，第二種名爲火燄彈，此乃挫傷敵軍士氣與焚燒哨崗之利器，多用於業林中，第三種名爲噴霧彈，此聲一經射出，即大霧瀰漫，藉以妨害敵方正確之射擊。</p>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　據德國通訊社前綫特派員報告戰况稱：東棧各戰區除奧勒爾一區外，刻均無大戰事，蓋過去數日蘇軍損失奇重，已無餘力增强軍隊所致。又南部戰綫之蘇軍，自於庫彭橋頭堡作戰失利後，即轉移目標企圖向諾伏洛西斯克方面進攻，經大砲之猛烈轟擊後，蘇軍戰車部隊即攻抵該方面之羅馬尼亞軍陣地，但經羅馬尼亞軍加以猛擊，蘇軍之企圖乃悉遭挫折。又密烏斯河及唐納資河兩戰綫之蘇軍，亦曾發動局部攻勢，經德軍邀擊，不支敗退。再奧勒爾地區之戰事已愈趨激烈，蘇軍以新銳步兵部隊及戰車部隊，迭次向德軍陣地猛擊，遭德軍反攻被阻未前，二十四日蘇軍于金綫扣失之一百七十七輛戰車內，其中一百六十三輛係於該方面所毀，由此可知德軍於該方面作戰之得手矣。</p>
<h3>西西里東北部　德軍防禦堅強　里昂福特區砲戰猛烈</h3>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　據德國新聞社軍事記者柏拉納稱：美軍坦克車及步兵曾向西西里德軍防綫右翼之數處陣地攻擊，冀圖突被，遂至發生大規模之戰鬥，但敵軍皆被擊潰且蒙重創。德方之戰鬥機及驅逐機對於此次防禦戰之成功極有貢獻，曾作果敢之低空飛行攻擊，使美軍受重大損失，美軍隊伍曾屢决因德機之襲擊而致慌亂，美軍之行動又受僞裝完善之軸心埋雷區及其他障碍所限。巴頓將軍所部每决迫近德軍陣地時，輒爲當地防軍擊退，美軍突擊隊沿巴勒摩以束之沿海公路進攻，亦未得逞。除在里昂福特地區雙方皆加緊砲戰外，其馀前綫地區皆甚安靜。在加比尼及里昂福特方面，英美軍已將陣地向南撤退，顯欲避免再受軸心之猛烈砲火轉擊而蒙重大之損失。德戰鬥機巡邏西島全部地區，曾擊潰英戰鬥機兩隊，並擊落英機五架，德機　無視失。快捷之德轟炸　亦襲擊敵軍戰終後方之供應綫·兵營·及軍隊之移動，英摩托魚雷艇一艘冀圖迫近米西那　峽，被高射砲擊中而着火，德重轟炸機　擊奧加斯達　港，擊沉　方登陸船三艘，並擊傷敵貨船五艘，喀太尼亞前綫戰况</p>
<h3>華萊士稱　與總統無忤</h3>
<p>里斯本廿六日中央社電　美國　總統華萊士。於星期日在底特律展覽會開幕時淺說稱，羅斯福總統，最　雖曾公開發表不利於渠之言論，但擊與總統初無釁隙，此爲羅斯福總統解散華萊士所主持之經濟戰爭局後華氏之第一次公　演講。</p>
<h3>英美機襲德　喪失六一架</h3>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　德空軍當局二十六日發表：英美空軍大隊於二十五日來襲德國西部魯爾地方及沿海岸一帶時，共被擊落六十一架，其中包括四發動機重轟炸機五十二架，德機亦損失四架</p>
<h3>英印當局　預防措施</h3>
<p>仰光二十六日中央社電　據到達當地之消息：印度國民軍編成後，英國因恐其進攻，近正不分晝夜，在加爾各答構築要塞及防空設施，以及防備暴動之市街陣地，加爾各答市內現已完成二百五十處公共防空壕云。蓋扛特拉鮑斯氏崛起後，孟買已大艮動搖，英印當局爲防止間諜行爲，已禁止販賣孟買州地圖，並予沒收一切印度地圖，更發佈命令，禁止五人以上之集會。</p>
<h3>廣州之行</h3>
<p>— 周佛海</p>
<p>今年四月到六月，三個月之中，北到哈爾濱，南到廣州，束到台北，西到武漢。因爲都是在天空中飛來飛去，不能說是僕僕風塵，只能說是僕僕風雲了。</p>
<p>我的旅行，不是一件很輕鬆，很悠閑的事：要應酬，要講演，要視察，要發表談話，要聽取報告，要指示方略。不過我是一個賤骨頭，也可以說是好事之徒，沒有福氣享受淸閑和安逸，越忙精神越好，越緊張身體越頑强：不僅是一天沒有事做，便覺潔身不適，就是一小時空閑，也覺着坐立不安。因此，我很歡喜訪間友邦或視察各地，過急促而緊張的生活！廣州之行，引起了許多同憶，發生了許多感想，夜窗人靜，閑着無事，特爲之記。</p>
<p>風雨端陽</p>
<p>木來可以由南京直飛廣州，因爲上海有事要料理，所以四號到上海，令飛機六號由南京開到上海等候，七號動身，七號，乃是舊曆端午節。淑慧和戚友，都勸我過節再走。我說已經電告廣州，不便更改。湊巧那幾天天氣不佳，他們都希望七號天氣惡劣，不能飛行。果眞，七號那天，大風大雨，不是「滿城風雨近重陽」，乃是滿天風雨過端陽了。不單七號走不成，八日也是一樣，眞把我煩悶極了。第一，因爲要走所以旣沒有故人晤談，也沒有治事的計劃，硬閑着在家坐了兩天。第二，不知天氣幾時可以轉晴，要等到何時纔可以動身。九號早晨起來，飛機的機長來電話，說可以飛行。於是和被赦的囚徒一樣，歡天喜地的到機塲。機長報告今天直飛廣州，不經台北。十時起飛，非常平穩，我不知不覺的睡着了。也不知經了多少的時間，覺得機身搖動得非常厲害，彷彿聽見隨員中有人說，「風雨眞厲害！」我張自向窗外一望，只見急雨打窗，漫天重霧，我懶得去管，不知不覺又睡着了。第二次醒來，看看表，是十二點十五分。機長報告下午一時可抵台北。我問隨員，先說直飛廣州，何以又要經台北？他們同答說，因爲路上過着在風暴雨，用的汽油太多，恐怕不夠飛到廣州，所以到台北補允。到了合北着陸之後，飛機塲的人說：「聽說你們直飛廣州，我們非常躭心，因爲香港附近有颶風正向北方前進。」他們把氣象報告圖給我看，一個很大的表示颶風的紅圈畫在上圖，眞把我駭了一跳。他們請我留住台北，並說：一不僅今天不能飛，就是明天上午也決不能飛，下午要看，情形再定。」我只得在台北留下。這次眞是危險極了。因爲在上海動身的時候，不知道有颶風，所以決定直航。如果不是途中遇着風雨，因汽油不足而到台北補充，遇着了颶風，不是要葬身海底嗎？死生有命，不能說不是有一定的。</p>
<p>台北小留</p>
<p>台灣總督府和台灣銀行都派人來照料，先送我們到鐵路飯店稍憇。上海動身的時候，天氣很凉，到台北熱極了，全身感覺不快。合北附近有高三千餘公尺的山，名叫草山，上面有很好的溫泉，是台北的避暑之所。他們送我們上山，同行的石渡最高顧問住合灣銀行的招待所，我和隨員住總督府的貴賓館。上山之後，大風大雨，便震天撼地的撲奔起來了。山上森林茂盛，遇着風雨，更覺山谷怒號，令人驚心動魄。我們渺小的飛機，如在大洋的上空，遇著這樣萬馬奔馳的急風驟雨，焉得不與魚龍爲伍！過後思之，猶有餘悸！</p>
<p>我是極愛溫泉的，此地的溫泉是硫磺質。一到山上，硫磺的氣味，便撲鼻而來。晚飯前入浴一次，飯後又入决，舒服極了。深山之中，深夜臥聽風雨之聲，眞有超塵出世之感。</p>
<p>十號早上，接得報告，上下午全都不能飛。於是和石渡顧問下山，拜訪總督府和合灣銀行謝其招待，並在台銀午飯，下午參觀博物館，農業實騐塲，林業實騐塲，和合北帝國大學。聽見農林業實騐塲塲長的報告，知道他們改良和發展台灣農林業的努力，眞令人又敬佩，又羨募。到帝大的土俗館，看見了許多關於生番的生活，風俗和手工業的資料，覺得很有興趣，可惜無暇細細的硏究。</p>
<p>十號晚上仍是雨絲風片，十一號風雨更大。閑着無事，煩悶欲死，一天入浴三次，　遺愁懷。晚上聽見簷前雨聲，樹上風聲，眞有伍子胥過昭　，　「心中好似滾油煎」　感！</p>
<p>重臨廣州</p>
<p>十二號早上，居然可以飛行了。下山到機塲，十一時起飛。繞香港入珠江流域。經香港的時候，同想二十七年十二月與公博由河內飛到九龍，思平到機塲去接的情形，猶歷歷在目。可惜只在高空中俯看，未能重遊舊地。三時到達廣州。闊別十六年的廣州，居然在面前了。十六年問，廣州遭逢的喪亂，閱歷的興亡，不知幾　，好像白雲山也蒼老了許多，不復常年的風采了。</p>
<p>第一次到廣州，是民國十三年五月，是應戴季陶先生電的的。和譚平山同船到廣州，住在永漢路一家旅館中。當時中央黨部在惠州會館，我便去那裏看季陶。他要我任宣傳部的秘書，因爲宣傳部新近接辦了香港的晨報，要我去香港暫住總主　，我因爲這個原因，曾經歷一個多月的記者生涯。當時找以爲毫無辦報的經騐，堅不肯去。季陶　我估價過高，以爲我去一定有辦法，所以只好前去一試。當時以爲總主筆只要一天做一篇社論就行了，新聞如何取捨。如何排列等問題，全都不知，全都不管。不到一月就發生一個小間題。有條消息說季陶要做廣東政務廳長，我不知道登出來於他不好，所又登了出來，他便寫信埋怨我，說他是不做官的，難道我還不知道，別人要中傷他，造了這個謠言，我何以要登載。以後在社論裏面也發生了幾個問題。因爲我當時還是共產黨員，立論當然有受攻擊的地方，因此我便自請調囘廣州。今天舊地重遊，便想到二十年前初到此地的一段香火因緣</p>

<h3>食油批發處　準備六期配給</h3>

<h3>租界交還後　即推進所得稅　自八月一日起認真徵收　添派人員清查商戶賬冊</h3>
<p>茲悉財政部所得稅處上海區徵收局，以公共租界法租界卽將交還，行政權旣告統一，稅政亟應銳意推進，過去租界特殊關係，所得稅收迭受種種障礙，以致商人抗繳國稅，隱匿不報，頗不乏人，茲爲伸展兩特區稅政，充裕國庫起見，除研究計劃徵收外僑所得稅外，特督飭屬員，於八月一日起，認真推動各類所得稅，並添派人員清查商戶，根據賬冊，催徴第一類營利事業所得稅，並帶徴三十年及二十九年度未繳之稅款，如再有抗繳或匿不申報者，查獲定當扭送法院追繳並處罰。聞最近商人因租界收回後，無法逃稅，爲免受當局懲處，大部份均自動紛紛申報繳納，故稅收已較前增加甚鉅，據該局葛局長對中央社記者稱「過去兩租界商民對營利所得稅匿報抗繳者甚多，而因租界特權問題，迭遭牽制不能執行稅政，租界收回後，徵稅卽可執行催徴，務使每一商民不得有逃稅之弊，但本局決不使商民稍受意外負擔與痛苦，此後當依法查賬徵稅，並嚴謹催徴人員遵守廉潔，俾不妨礙商人正當利益，而充裕國庫收入云。」</p>
<h3>公共租界納稅華人會　昨日宣布解消　聯席會議通過解消宣言</h3>
<p>公共租界納稅華人會茲以公共租界將於八月一日由國府實施接收，該會以任務完成，無存在之必要，愛於昨（二十六）日下午三時，在該會會所舉行全體執行委員華董華委聯席會議，作光榮之解消，市府陳市長特派趙秘書長代表參與，丁社會福利部長並準時列席，會議由東濟成主席：行禮如儀後，即報告解消開會宗旨畢，由東市長代表趙秘書長丁社會福利部長相繼高產田訓，旋由袁履登林康侯致詞，及全體一致通過解消宣言，最後宣讀上　主席曁陳市長致敬電，及致日義法邦伸謝電，至下午四時半，進用茶點後開始告散會。</p>
<p>解消　宣言</p>
<p>公共租界納稅華人會解消宣言略謂「上海公共租界，將於本年八月一日，實行接收，從此行政主權得以統一。回溯本會夙以謀市民福利與工部局折衝爲任務，今工部局旣因租界之收回而廢除，本會任務亦隨之終了，受於收回租界之先，宣告解消矣。考本會自民九成立以迄於今，屈指二十餘載，本革命　奮鬥之精神，與英美勢力作不屈不撓之周旋，凡所建樹，昭昭在人耳目，值茲解消之際，願就過去之工作及當前觀感，略有抒述，以告國人。</p>
<p>上海公共租界系辛丑南京條約之產物，其行政總樞爲工部局，而工部局之最高權力機關爲納稅人產生之董事會，遺事九人，全爲外藉，國人無與焉，局內重要職員，亦鮮有國人捶足，租界市民，華人佔十之九，所納捐稅，亦居工部局收入之大部份，而操縱之權，悉在外人，事之不平，毋庸赘述。其後不幸事件時有發生，市民公憤不可遏制，遂有本會之成立，爭取華人之福利，此民國九年十月十四日事也。迨至十四年五月五卅事件發生，　情憤激，舉國沸騰，本會傾導市民，於惡劣環境下奮鬥不懈，終於十七年三月，決定於工部局加入華董三席華委六席，由本會推選，各處高級職員，亦均有華人參加。至十九年，華董人數更加至五席，華委亦遲有增加，雖行政大權仍操　英美人之手，惟市民利益，得以保全不少。卅年四月十四日舉行納稅華人代表大會，推選陳濟成爲本會副主席兼代主席，出席工部局，董委亦均重選參加，自此本會工作復進於積極之階段，兩戰以還，奮鬥不渝，此本會自成立以迄今茲之經過也。本會成立之旨，厥在保障市民合法利益，以與英美抗衡，夫租界之存在，終爲我國政治之重創巨難，謀國權之完整，與夫國人權益之獲致，非收回租界之先聲，租界既收回，實本會任務之完成，今者英美人所盤踞之公共租界，賴有邦之協助，曁主座之德威，已　定本年八月一日收回，國人數十年來之積憤，得以消除，市民數百萬人之幸福，得以增進，而本會尤有夙願得償，仔肩得息之怏，其爲欣慰，實匪言可宣矣。抑有進者，本會之組織，雖自今解消，然同仁反抗英美之精神與乎協助當局以謀幸福利之苦心，非惟不因而消除，且當持續之發揚之，以期其永久，以冀其光大，庶幾英美侵略勢力，不復能在我大上海有插足之餘地，而行政純一後之上海市政，更能自臻進步，日趨輝煌，旣以耀國人無上之光榮，亦以酬友邦無窮之盛意，此則本會於茲解消之際更願寄其熱烈之期待，與殷切之盼禱都也」。</p>
<h3>電車售票員　須禮貌待人　爲防止擠軋起見　將裝設車站鐵欄</h3>
<p>上海電車公司當局，以該公司所僱用售票員，常對乘客蠻不講理，有時甚至恃強欺凌，故特於最近普遍通知各售票員以及司機，今後對乘客務希待以禮貌。同時電車公司與警方當局，爲防止乘客搶搭電車，以致發生意外起見，特計劃於各主要車站，裝置鐵欄杄，以便乘客列隊順序而登車。此種鐵欄杆，於兆豐公園二十路無軌電車車站旁，業已裝置云。</p>

<h3>上海第一個孤兒院　土山灣孤兒院巡禮</h3>

<p>蘭云小學除了，高初　　（卽特別班）之外特爲殘疾孤兒設立一所聾啞學校，進行特別教育，第一步使了解手勢，口勢，發間，進而授以一切基本課程，第二步再使學習正　因爲聾啞孤兒能專心向學，成績不僅能與非聾啞者競爭，而且不少傑出之材，據說該院工藝品之最佳者，每出於聾啞畢業生之手，這是值得敎育家研究的事實。</p>
<h3>宗敎文化大觀</h3>
<p>土山灣孤兒院在蒲西路佔有土地面積六十三畝，院舍除四部　爲慈雲學校外，東部便完全開設工塲，工塲現五大部，蒙該院負責人呂道茂祖父（法　　　　　　），如入山陰道上，如入萬花園中，誰相信這是　　院呢？</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>經濟界緊急對策</h3>
<p>日中國經濟考察團團長小倉正恒氏此次返抵東京後對記者團發表談話，謂：「目前中國經濟界之緊急對策，一爲物價問題，一爲糧食問題……中國國內物價，急激上升，考其原因，實爲囤積所致，當前之對策，須加強收買配給等機構……並應從經濟上法律上採取適當擔置；又解決糧食問題之重點，厥在改良收買方法，並應以適當之指導方法，開發義地，以謀生產之增加。」這幾句話，便是小倉氏對於中國經濟病狀的胗斷。</p>
<p>詳研小倉氏之談話，深覺中國當前兩大緊急經濟問題——安定物價與解決食糧——其重點在於強化收買配給：強化配給，自當以強化收買爲其先決條件，而強化收買，復當以取締物資投機囤積爲其初步工作。所以，以全國商業統制總會，物資調查委員會及物資統制審議會三個團體爲樞紐的經濟統制實施機構，實有高度強化的必要，使其能夠實行擊破物資囤積的堡壘。我們認爲属行法律上的嚴峻步驟，實爲「加強收買配給等機構」的惟要素。</p>

<p>昨華股稍有曲折，始承上週末昂勢堅定，中途曾起回風，但於正午在某種傳說中重趨高翔，各方人心於恍惚中突向榮，少數股票又出現新高　。新藥業之中法晨初飛升甚巨，不久風傳增資辦法對於股東權利有限，新亞藥廠盤漲較巨，五洲昂叩開口，中西堅定，信誼俏挺。百貨業永安升後有半百以上之回風，午刻距上，與新新軋升不少，國貨漲度較微，麗安百貨跳升甚勁，景福與景綸兩衫襪盤升。紡織業之永安紡織又升百餘。信和·五和·榮豐·大光明·國信等股均有進展。仁豐染織高出票面數倍。大中華及宏甡兩織造步長。文化業最爲穩定，設備及世界兩書局漲風已戢，終見軋平，中華獨見回挫，永觧印書上升，南洋煙公司因上週末國團日升勢過銳，回小亦勁，大中華火柴又見躍上，閘北水電及華商電氣升勢仍緩，實業股久安實業增查消息亦起，於午刻某戶提拉頗力，中國及國華兩投資及大中華實業買戶喊價更高，新亞建業又出大關，新益地產挺升，聯華亦躍起，中與森業購抬者更切，乃有一送二新股之增資消息也。康元製罐挺升不已，吉美食品求得者日衆，華豐塘瓷·德豐針織·中國鍾廠均各步升，沈寂已久之中華電影，昨突起買風，市氣頗堅。</p>

<h3>廣州之行　自第二版轉來</h3>
<p>陳省長德昭送我到省府的招待所，路上經過東山，是我前寓居之所，我的住宅就在很大的哥而夫球塲近傍，現在不單是房子無影無蹤，連球塲也沒有看見了。經過了舊省　會，是當年粵軍總司令部，經過了東校塲，是當年北伐誓師之所，現在都變了，完全變了。經過了文德路，永漢路以及許多不知名的馬路，到了一個地方，德昭告訴我這是四關。四關？現在和二十年前我們外江人認爲神秘的西關完全不同了！當時西關內是沒有馬路的，還是大塊靑石鋪成的舊式街道，和馬路接鄰的地方有木柵欄隔着。當時的商團，便以此爲根據地。我們當時認爲西關是買辦階級反對革命的根據地，認爲是神秘的巢窟。現在馬路一通，神秘也就暴露了，而且事變以後，變成了繁盛的中心了，非常熱鬧。最後到了招待所。我和德昭說當年由天字碼頭坐小船到荔枝灣去玩，記得風景很好，現在想再去一次。他說「這裏不就是荔枝灣嗎？」原來荔枝灣早已成住宅區了。眞是滄海桑田，我還在做夢呢</p>
<p>珠江賞月</p>
<p>到廣州第一件快活的事人，便是到沙面去賞珠江的夜月。十二號晚上，承汪夫人接宴，</p>
<p>汪夫人說沙面已經接此了，今夜月色甚佳，我們可以到沙面去賞月。於是便隨汪夫人和德昭到沙面。沙面！到了此地，便想起十四年的沙基慘案，以前，這個彈丸之地，乃是英美在粵侵略的根據地。現在把他們驅逐出去了，靑天白日旗飛揚在這個區域了。花旗銀行，也變成中央儲備銀行了。我們從西橋進去，從東橋出來。沿着珠江繞了一週。在月影波光中，遙望白鵝潭，遙望對岸的河南，撫今思昔，不禁悠然神往。</p>
<p>視察學校</p>
<p>在廣州視察許多工廠學校，檢閱了軍隊警察和靑少年團，都有很蓬勃向上的氣象，其中令我感動的，是汪夫人所主辦的工讀學校。這個學校，都是收容無父母的孤兒，大的不過十二三歲，少的只有兩三歲。他們的動作，都是軍事部勒。我看他們立正敬禮種種動作，都非常正確。我雖然不是軍人，但是因爲担任軍隊政治訓練的關係，過了四五年軍隊生活，深覺我們的日常生活，一定要軍事化纔有規律，纔有精神。我常留心看一般人鞠躬行禮的時候，脚步是如何站的。大槪都是兩脚分開的，但是分開的形式又不同，有些左脚在前，右脚在後，有些恰恰相反；有些左右併齊，而仍是分開，也有些雖然兩脚緊接，但是不是立正的姿勢，而是把兩雙脚像一雙筷一樣攏在一起。還有行禮時，眼睛一定要看着對方的人，所謂「注目」。但是許多人眼睛看着別的地方行禮，我不知他們對誰行禮。這雖然是小的地方，但是可以證明我們日常的行動，沒有訓練以致不整齊，無規律，現在看見這些男女小朋友，不舉是天眞活潑，動作敏捷，而且每一個動作，都很正確。這當然是訓練認眞的成績。此外，關於勞作的練習，自治的組織，都很有可採之處，希望各地的兒童間，練都以此爲模範。</p>

<p>十五日上午赴黃花崗，恭謁七十二烈士的　靈。黃花崗，民國十三年偕淑慈參拜一次之後，至今年已二十年了。這二十年之中，國家遭遇了多少變化，個人經歷了多少憂患，現在的情形，國家仍舊河山破碎，七十二烈士之遺志，未　完全實現，個人則依然故我，百無一成，重臨聖地，家國之感，不禁油然而生。人生的遇合，那裏能逆料呢？當時收埋七十二烈士的忠骨的，是嚴孟繁先生。他當時任廣州府知府，是一位幹員。那時我還是鄉村私塾的一個塾童。當時那裏會知道三十年之後，我會做財政部長，他會做次長，而有三年的同僚之雅呢？</p>
<p>由黃花崗到觀音山。當我還沒有重到廣州之前，很關心觀音山上的鎮海樓，俗名五層樓的，在兵火之餘是否仍舊存在。到那裏一看，雖然遺跡尙存，已經是破壞不堪了。此樓在南越故寓舊址。明初所建。我們湖南先賢彭剛直公曾書一聯云：「萬千刦危樓尙存，問誰摘斗摩星，目空今古。」「五百年故侯安在？」使我憑欄看劍，淚灑英雄！這個對聯，因兵變燬去，胡漢民先生重書之，復自作一聯云：「五嶺北來，珠海最宜明月夜。」「白云晚望，故寓猶是漢時秋。」如今也都燬去，徒留下後人憑吊的遺跡而已。登紀念塔，遠望白雲山聳立於後，珠江橫繞於前，十萬人家，炊烟縷縷，不覺心曠神怡,豪氣縱橫，雖不敢有彭剛直公目空今古之槪，却發生了淚灑英雄之感。</p>
<p>由紀念塔下山，經過山腰一地，有碑聳立，上書孫先生讀書治事處，就是當年陳炯明叛逆時砲擊的地方。我重臨此地，恰巧是總理蒙難二十一週年紀念的先一天。囘想當年總理脫險的情形，以一艘軍艦抵禦叛逆的大兵的情形，更增加景仰和崇拜的心思。</p>
<p>海珠觀劇</p>
<p>在廣州最後的一晚，因爲行事均已完畢，省府同志，約到海珠戲院去看粵戲。提起看戲，我是極感興趣的。我平生有三大憾事。最愛讀詩而不能作，最愛山水畫而不能畫，最愛聽京戲而不能唱。我很想能作詩，能畫畫，能唱戲，看見別的人能夠，非常羨慕。但是我沒有這些事情的天才，恐怕這三大憾事，終身不能彌補了。</p>
<p>粵語我大約能聽，說白是懂的。唱詞，因爲汪夫人叫人買了一本給我，一面對證古本去看，一面去聽，自然全部了解。那齣戲，叫「客途秋恨」，詞句很好，乃是廣東最有名的戲，描寫洪楊剛要起兵時的一段戀愛的事。因此，看起來，很感覺興趣。我覺得古人的戀愛，是文學的，今日靑年男女的戀愛是科學的。因此，古人戀愛的事實，可以使人感動，今人的戀愛，則完全是機械的，而不能感動人。我覺得甚麼事都可以科學化，惟有戀愛不能科學化。科學化的戀愛，實在是乾燥無味。公博在上期本刊所載的「偏見」一文中說，男女初戀時雙方最普遍的問題，是「你真愛我嗎」？「我真愛你」。「你愛我那一點」？「我也不知道」。「你旣然不知道，爲甚麼愛我」，「如果我能夠說出，那也不算真愛了」。確實一點也不會錯，這是戀愛初期的普遍問答。但是我還要補充兩句，就是「你能永久這樣愛我嗎」？「當然是永久的，一直愛你到我死的那一天」。「恐怕你對別人也是這樣罷」。「決不，我覺得世界上除你之外，沒有第二個値得愛的人」。這差不多是千篇一律的公式一樣的固定。這樣以幾何代數的公式來談的戀愛，就是科學化的戀愛。其實，無論何人，如果你問他是否真愛你，他即使不是真愛，那裏會不指天誓日的說是真的？也許他同時有兩三個愛人，甚至五六個愛人，但是如果你問他是否對別人也是一樣，他一定說只愛你一個，科學化的戀愛，是靠不住的，是無味的，那裏能比得上脈脈含情，心心相印的富有文學意義的戀愛的滋味呢？離　太遠的話，就此截止了罷。</p>
<p>十六號的天氣甚好，我們一行，便一直由廣州飛囘上海。雖然只有四天的勾留，但是十六年的闊別，却借此得到相當的慰藉（韓載古今半月刋夏季特大號）</p>

<h3>The Construction of a New Shanghai and the Problem of Talent</h3>
<p>Since the date for the return of the Shanghai International Settlement became fixed, France and Italy followed suit and signed agreements with our country to return administrative power over Shanghai and its concessions. The term "concession" will soon become a historical term. The term 'concession' is very confusing; the lease term seems to exist yet not exist, and the boundary seems fixed yet not fixed, while the orders issued by the lessees resemble those of landlords. This is truly unheard of both at home and abroad, and unprecedented in ancient and modern times. Within China, an organic body, the existence of this deformed parasitic structure undoubtedly hinders soundness and development. Therefore, since the Paris Peace Conference, the Chinese government and the public have been striving to "recover" the concessions as an urgent task. However, it could not be realized in "twenty-five years," and since Japan implemented its new policy toward China, in just "half a year," all Shanghai concessions have been "returned" voluntarily by various parties, restoring the unified administrative power of Greater Shanghai. Comparing the meanings of the two terms "recovery" and "return," and comparing the duration of time between "twenty-five years" and "half a year," we cannot help but feel a sense of joy and apprehension. Under the general outline of building a new Shanghai, there are thousands of issues that we feel should and deserve to be discussed. Let us discuss the problem of talent with an attitude of both joy and apprehension.</p>
<p>In our newspaper's editorial on July 6th, we already discussed the construction of a new Shanghai and its civic institutions. We supplemented it with an editorial on the 20th, precisely to hope that the Shanghai citizens, in their jubilation, would not forget their responsibility to assist the government. They should organize meticulously, conduct thorough research, prepare to provide data for plans, and cultivate the ability to supervise and implement them practically. People of impartiality, integrity, high knowledge, and foresight from all walks of life should form a link between the government and the public. While the government should, of course, try its best to listen to public opinion and adopt public sentiment, it also needs to compile the fragmentary suggestions from all sides into a systematic plan and promote it practically under a consistent national policy. As the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun commented on June 27th, "...After the concessions are taken back, the Shanghai Municipal Council, which has been exclusively occupied by the British and Americans, will inevitably be abolished at the same time. New district offices under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Special Municipality, headed by Chinese people, will be established, and the Shanghai Special Municipality will be the highest administrative organ in Shanghai..." (See the selected translations of current events in this newspaper on July 6th. Note that this was only discussing the International Settlement at the time.) However, to complete the mission of these district offices and this highest administrative organ, empty words are of no help. The urgency of the need for talent cannot be described by ink and paper. At this time and in this place, it is particularly worth paying attention to the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The concessions have existed for a century. In this century, from a positive perspective, Shanghai has transformed from a beach into a metropolis and has become the center of economy and culture. Its prosperity and decline affect not only China but also the rise and fall of the entire East Asian region. From a negative perspective, although Shanghai belongs to China's territory, the concessions were not originally ceded. However, China's administrative power has long been unable to reach the concessions, making them extraterritorial. They encompass all kinds of products that do not conform to China's national conditions, which is enough to affect the normal development of China's economy, culture, and politics. Therefore, the highest administrative organ governing the entire Greater Shanghai, as well as the heads and officials of the district offices, have the mission not only to maintain and enhance the status of the Shanghai concessions but also to give them new life, restore them to brightness, and make them model cities. In the future, the whole country will follow suit, the atmosphere will change, and the impact will be enormous. Therefore, the talent needed at this time and in this place is not limited to technical expertise, but also requires a style of enduring hardship and bearing resentment without shirking difficulties. Otherwise, they will not be able to perform their duties happily and may even fall into an irreversible situation.</p>
<p>(2) Since the National Government returned to the capital, the most difficult thing it has felt is the lack of talent. This is an undeniable fact. Frankly speaking, those who can truly be called talents and are worthy of the name are rare in China. Moreover, they cannot be concentrated under the same banner to cooperate with each other, or they are scattered in various places, each adhering to the principle of self-preservation and not seeking to be enlightened at the time. The reason for this is that the government also has an unavoidable responsibility. It should be known that the people's return to benevolence is like water flowing downwards. For more than three years since the return to the capital, the policies it has initiated have not been intended to consider the national economy and the people's livelihood, and the difficulties have been repeated and the management has been dismal. The people should know the government's hardships, observe the international situation, adhere to the training of every man being responsible, and contribute to the country to the best of their ability. However, a completely peaceful situation has not been formed, but the trend of separatism has grown, and the effects of economic policies have not been achieved, but the phenomenon of people not being able to make a living has become apparent. To cleanse one's tassel in clear water or muddy water, the difficulty of seeking talent lies in this subtlety. Now that the concessions have been abolished, a century of humiliation has been wiped out, and a century of wishes have been fulfilled. Everyone has the same heart, and the heart has the same reason. Who does not regard this as the greatest achievement of the National Government after its return to the capital, and also the initial stage of strengthening the National Government? If this epoch-making opportunity can be used, and the agencies that take over the concessions can completely adopt the principle of talent, thoroughly reform and innovate, rectify the views of the international community, and increase the people's confidence, then the past cannot be admonished, but the future can still be pursued. The wind on the grass will spread throughout the universe, and talent will converge, and there will be those who come from afar. Therefore, the influence of the need for talent at this time and in this place is not limited to the construction of a new Shanghai but also affects the fate of the entire organization. If we delay again and again, time will not wait for us, and the opportunity to strengthen the National Government will be fleeting.</p>
<p>(3) The conditions for talent are like this, and the importance of talent is like this. In addition, the original organization of the two concession councils is categorized and enormous. To be able to meet the needs of both quality and quantity, we must take into account both invitation and cultivation. Those who speak of talent in the world often emphasize learning and neglect character. However, they do not know that true talent must have its integrity and extraordinary cultivation, preferring to eat simple food and drink water from a gourd in a poor alley rather than stooping to the level of others to curry favor with the times. In times of crisis, they may be able to stand up and take on important responsibilities. They cannot be induced or threatened by profit, nor can they be summoned to come and dismissed to leave. Being without desire makes one strong, and there is no deliberate affectation. Enlightened rulers who seek virtuous people and select talent all humble themselves to scholars. The reason for this is that if they regard themselves as peaceful and advanced and reveal arrogance unconsciously, they will reject people from afar, which is not the way to invite them. In addition, seeking talent should not be too harsh, and results should not be too urgent. It must be known that character is more important than learning. Those who have learning but have low character are only high-level scoundrels, who are more than capable of ruining things but not enough to accomplish them. On the contrary, those who have high character and only one skill should also be recruited in various ways and placed appropriately so that they can give play to their abilities. Moreover, the concessions themselves have a long history. Once they are involved, they must first be observed, plans must be formulated, and progress must be made step by step, so that the results can gradually become apparent. If the performance evaluation is not based on the facts, it will lead to wanting to be fast but not reaching the goal, and it will destroy promising talents, which is not the way to cultivate them. Invitation and cultivation are used together, so that talent, no matter how high or low, can be accepted and assimilated. From this, metabolism can be achieved, so that the construction of a new Shanghai will become more and more brilliant, internally it can gain the trust of the people, and externally it can show the international community. Whether our actual ability to revive China and defend East Asia can be demonstrated depends on this one move.</p>
<p>In short, the greater the responsibility for taking over the Shanghai concessions, and the more troublesome the work of building a new Shanghai, the more important the issue of talent becomes. Even a slight oversight will lead to mistaking the box for the pearl and becoming a laughingstock to the world. How can we face our friendly countries and thank our countrymen? With the sincerity of starting with caution, I would like to offer a humble opinion.</p>

<h3>Japanese Foreign Ministry Convenes Meeting to Discuss Countermeasures to the Current Situation; Foreign Minister Orders Envoys to Southern Europe to Take Flexible Measures</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - Since assuming office, Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu has been paying close attention to the development of the pressing world war situation and has been dealing with it carefully. In particular, after the end of the Tunisian campaign on May 13, the Axis powers' attempts to counterattack in the Mediterranean, and the illegal bombing of Italy by the Allied forces, he has paid even more attention. On the 10th, taking advantage of the Allied forces' attack on Sicily, he sent telegrams to the envoys stationed in Southern Europe, ordering them to take flexible measures as soon as possible to ensure that the Axis powers' undefeated position could be completed without any regrets. The Japanese Foreign Ministry, based on this, had previously appointed Arita and Yamakawa as advisors on the 21st to assist in planning and promoting wartime diplomacy, aiming to operate the Foreign Ministry with collective wisdom to ensure victory. In addition to holding the first meeting on the 24th, a second meeting was held at 2:00 p.m. on the 26th. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's attention to adopting countermeasures to the constantly changing trends of the European war is particularly noteworthy.</p>
<h3>In Power for Twenty-One Years, Mussolini Resigns; Italian King Appoints Himself Commander of the Three Services; Badoglio Succeeds as Prime Minister</h3>

No one is allowed to neglect their duties and obligations. All my people should fully understand that the sacred land of the motherland has suffered great wounds. Italy can only help the country achieve construction and revival through the armed struggle of its military forces and the determination of its people. I want to protect the motherland with the people of the whole country, based on the unwavering belief in the eternal life of the country, and unite to move forward hand in hand."</p>
<p>New Prime Minister's Inaugural Declaration</p>
<p>Rome, 26th (Central News Agency) - After taking office, the new Prime Minister of the Italian government, Marshal Badoglio, declared that Italy would continue to fight against the Allied forces.

The war will continue in the future. Italy has suffered heavy blows in its invaded provinces and destroyed cities, but in order to maintain its thousand-year tradition, Italy will fulfill its promises. You should gather around the King. The King is a model for the motherland and is also a symbol of pride for all of you. My orders are clear and concise and must be carried out earnestly. Anyone who dares to obstruct them will suffer the consequences of their own folly. Anyone who attempts to disturb or confuse the people will be severely punished."</p>
<p>Badoglio's Brief Biography</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) - The new Italian Prime Minister, Marshal Badoglio, is currently seventy-two years old and was born in Grachazano, Piedmont Province. He graduated from the Terrik Army Officer School in 1890. From 1896 to 1897, he participated in the Eritrean campaign, and from 1911 to 1912, he participated in the Tripoli campaign. During World War I, he served as the staff officer of the Italian Second Army and then commanded the Second and Twenty-seventh Army Corps. In the autumn of 1917, he was appointed as the Deputy Minister of the General Staff. After the armistice, he became a Senator from 1919 onwards and successively served as a senior government commissioner, envoy to Romania, envoy to the United States, and ambassador to Brazil. In 1925, he was promoted to Marshal and took the position of Chief of the General Staff of the Army. He was then appointed as the Minister of the General Staff. From 1928 to 1933, he served as the Governor of Libya and also as the Commander-in-Chief of Italian East Africa. In five months, he conquered Abyssinia and was appointed as its governor, receiving the title of Duke of Addis Ababa. On December 6, 1940, he resigned from the position of Chief of the General Staff of the Italian Army.</p>
<h3>Italy Declares Martial Law Throughout the Country</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to dispatches from Rome, the Italian government today issued an order that the Italian army monitor and maintain public order throughout the country.

<h3>Guariglia Promoted to Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Rome, 26th (Central News Agency) - The Italian Ambassador to Turkey, Baron Guariglia, has been appointed as the new Foreign Minister. It is reported that Guariglia is currently flying back here to take up his new post.</p>
<h3>Spain Convenes Emergency Cabinet Meeting</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to dispatches from Madrid, the Spanish government convened an emergency cabinet meeting late on the 25th.</p>
<h3>Turkey Adopts a Cautious Attitude</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 26th (Central News Agency) - As the Sicilian war is underway, there is a possibility that the British and American forces will carry out an invasion in the Balkans and the Eastern Mediterranean. Therefore, Turkey is extremely concerned about this. However, Turkey's attitude towards this has not been formally stated. Turkish newspapers write articles every day about what Turkey's attitude will be in the event of such a situation, but their material and wording are extremely cautious. However, since the intelligence agencies established by the British and Americans in Turkey are larger in scale and organization than those of the Axis powers, there is more news about the Allied war effort. However, the Turkish government is well aware that if it makes the wrong choice, it will invite disaster. Therefore, it does not use the propaganda of the belligerent countries and the censorship of newspapers is carried out along these lines. Judging from the Turkish government's cautious attitude, it is possible to maintain neutrality permanently. According to news from the Turkish foreign affairs, the British and Americans have already questioned the Turkish government on whether it intends to allow the British and Americans to use Turkish ports and harbors and whether American warships can enter Turkish ports for repairs, and whether the British and American forces can set up military supply depots in the country. It is said that the Turkish government has ignored these requests. However, Turkey is even more aware that after the British and Americans win the war in Sicily, they will increase the pressure on Turkey. Therefore, since the British and American forces landed in Sicily, Turkey has adopted an even more cautious attitude.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Intercept American Air Force Stationed in Chongqing; Aerial Battle Occurs Over Hengyang; Twenty-Eight American Planes Shot Down and Several Military Facilities Destroyed; Japanese Air Force Preemptively Deters the Movements of the American Air Force in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 p.m. on the 26th that the Japanese air force continued to bomb the forward bases of the American air force stationed in Chongqing at Hengyang, Lingling, Baoqing, Zhijiang, Jian'ou airfields for three days from July 23rd to 25th, bombing the runways and their affiliated facilities at each airfield, causing them to suffer heavy damage. Twenty-eight enemy planes were shot down near Hengyang, Lingling, and Guilin. The Japanese side shot down eight of their own planes. According to a dispatch from a Japanese military base on the 26th, the elite of the Japanese army air force used a joint large formation of fighters and bombers to attack Hengyang, Hunan Province three times on the mornings of the 23rd and 25th, inflicting a great blow to the American air force stationed in Chongqing. On the afternoon of the 25th, a fighter plane strongly attacked Hengyang. The Japanese high-speed fighter squadron departed on that day to fully extinguish the American air force's fighting spirit. Upon reaching the skies over Hengyang, they discovered more than a dozen American Curtiss (P40) and Lockheed (P38) aircraft. They immediately launched a heroic aerial battle, shooting down three enemy (P40) aircraft and one (P38) aircraft. The remnants fled in panic. The entire Japanese aircraft fleet returned in triumph. It is reported that the (P38) aircraft is the American air force's boasted twin-engine fighter, which has been repeatedly used for reconnaissance and attacks in the past.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to military experts here, since the enemy army began its general counterattack in the South Pacific, the sea, land, and air three-dimensional decisive battle between the Japanese and American forces in the Solomon Islands, New Georgia Island has been extremely fierce. At this time, Japanese army aircraft constantly attacked the American air force, which was based in various places in Chongqing and attempted to bombard the Japanese mainland by air, smashing enemy base facilities and shooting down twenty-eight enemy elite aircraft. This victory has been announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 26th. The enemy army believes that air raids on the Japanese mainland from the Chongqing airfields are most effective in terms of strategy. Therefore, although they have been constantly attacked by the Japanese air force, they are still trying to make a comeback. Therefore, they often use the air transport capacity of only a few hundred tons to continuously supply supplies via the Chongqing-India air route. It is reported that their air force situation has recently been prepared, so they are gradually coordinating with the counterattack operations of the enemy army in the South Pacific and have begun to stir. They have sent aircraft to reconnoiter important locations in peaceful areas and blindly bombed Vietnam to launch an aerial blitzkrieg. However, the Japanese army air force stationed in China has been closely monitoring the enemy army's movements for a long time and believes that the opportunity cannot be missed. Therefore, on the 23rd, 24th, and 25th, they continuously used elite aircraft formations to bombard the American air force's forward bases, including the Hengyang, Lingling, Baoqing, Zhijiang, Jian'ou, and Guilin airfields, severely damaging the runways and various facilities at each airfield, and shooting down twenty-eight enemy P-40 fighters, severely damaging several enemy aircraft on the ground, thoroughly inflicting a major blow to the enemy's forward bases in Chongqing. Therefore, the Japanese air force's preemptive attack completely shattered the enemy's counterattack attempt.</p>

<p>Japanese Army Excelled at Jungle Warfare</p>
<p>Geneva, Central News Agency, a military reporter of "Daily Mail" among American troops in New Georgia, described in detail the suffering of American troops in the jungle warfare of various islands in the Pacific. He said, "The jungle itself is the biggest enemy. Soldiers often have to wade through mud that is chest-deep and have to deal with various dangers. Our soldiers are not used to this environment, so they feel terrified at night, which makes their nerves very tense. They cannot rest day and night. Only younger people can endure this hardship. Our enemies are not like this at all. The Japanese army can adapt in a short time and seems to have received excellent training in jungle warfare. They are very good at camouflage. This instinct is not possessed by American soldiers."</p>

<h3>The Fourth Central Cooperation Conference in Japan</h3>
<p>The fourth Central Cooperation Conference of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, with the two major goals of completing decisive battle production and implementing decisive battle living, was held at the Greater East Asia Hall on the morning of the 14th, lasting three days, and closed at around 6:00 PM on the 16th. The details of the proceedings are described below:</p>
<p>The opening ceremony was held at 9:05 AM in the meeting hall on the fourth floor of the Greater East Asia Hall. Navy Admiral Kobayashi served as chairman. Prime Minister Tojo, who had returned from the front lines, all cabinet members, and a total of 216 staff members and councilors of the association all attended. After formal greetings, Chairman Kobayashi held the Imperial Rescript. Mr. Kozo Imai, 74 years old (Kagawa Prefectural Assembly), took an oath on behalf of all councilors. After the oath, Prime Minister Tojo delivered a speech, revealing the government's determination and requesting national cooperation (speech see this newspaper on July 15th). Chairman Kobayashi then delivered a speech, selecting representatives to convey gratitude to the Japanese military to the Army and Navy Ministries. Subsequently, President Suzuki of the Planning Board gave a speech on various important government policies, and President Amau of the Information Bureau gave a speech on internal and external situations (both speeches see this newspaper on July 15th). Secretary-General Maruyama reported on the status of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. Discussion began at 11:00 AM. Mr. Motozaburo Takada (Editor-in-Chief of the Mainichi Shimbun) spoke first. Thirty-six councilors spoke according to the decision, and there was a temporary break at noon.</p>
<p>At 1:00 PM, the meeting reconvened. First, the representatives briefly reported the results of conveying the resolution of gratitude to the Army and Navy Ministries, and then the councilors continued to speak and discuss various issues such as cooperation between government and civilians, educational reform, national mobilization, enterprise consolidation, science and technology, key transportation, food production increase, decisive battle living, and national health movement. Representatives from all sectors and regions fully expressed the wartime national determination. The meeting adjourned around 8:00 PM.</p>
<p>The proceedings of the first day are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The focus of the first day's conference was on labor relations and student mobilization. Under the current situation in Japan, supplementing labor to enhance military strength is an urgent task. To complete decisive battle production, regardless of men or women, they should all invigorate the spirit of diligence. Mr. Tadayoshi Obata, Chairman of the Industrial Patriotic Association, advocated the establishment of a national industrial reserve team. This industrial reserve team would have two types: 1. A reserve team to maintain the number of laborers. 2. A reserve team to adapt to special skills. When organizing and withdrawing, it is hoped that excellent factories will provide sacrificial cooperation.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of materials, Mr. Tatsuyoshi Machida, Director of the Practice Bureau of the Industrial Patriotic Association, stated: One of the difficulties in increasing production is that essential living materials cannot meet the minimum requirements of individuals. Laborers engaged in production are closely related to production, so distribution must be implemented. In view of the shortage of materials, in general, priority should be given to military needs over civilian needs, and essential living materials should be distributed to laborers individually. Special attention should be paid to the nutrition of young laborers, as they are the foundation of national strength, in order to enhance the awareness of increasing production.</p>
<p>The current enterprise consolidation, along with the food issue, is one of the biggest problems facing Japan. At the first day's meeting, there were many opinions worth listening to. Mr. Ishiro Sakai, Chairman of the Textile Industry Association, belonging to the first category of industrial sectors, hoped that urgent measures would be taken in the first category of industrial sectors regarding the four aspects of operation, retention, conversion, and abolition. Mr. Hiroshi Ikai advocated transferring factories related to major industries to national management as soon as possible, expanding production by command of authority, and also requested effective and appropriate measures.</p>
<p>Mr. Sakuta Goto, Director of the Sanbi Manufacturing Plant, belonging to the second category of industrial sectors, pointed out that the government has never had appropriate guidance on the planned utilization of converted factories, leaving merchants to trade directly, resulting in unjustifiable price increases and hindering increased production. Mr. Yutaka Nakamura, Director of the Iriyama Coal Mine, advocated: 1. National coal mines should be reorganized. 2. When reorganizing, it should be calculated separately for each region and each coal mine. 3. Start with areas that contribute to the rapid enhancement of military strength. The above-mentioned issues, from the perspective of enhancing military strength, are urgent issues that cannot be ignored or delayed, and are worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of securing domestic self-sufficiency in national food, there were also various noteworthy remarks. The councilors all discussed the current situation based on their long-term personal experience, emphasizing that the focus of increased production today, in addition to the shortage of production materials, lies in the human problem. Only by promoting their sense of responsibility can we overcome difficulties. The crux of securing the food issue during the decisive battle period was fully explained.</p>
<p>The most discussed issue was the supply of rice. Mr. Hideo Takahashi (Director of the Strong Headquarters) emphasized the relationship between the planting and supply ratio of cultivated land, and the allocation of all materials should be based on the supply performance. Mr. Goro Imai (Mayor of Okaya) stated the necessity of responsible production based on Japanese farmers' account books.</p>
<p>Mr. Akiro Asakura (General Affairs of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association) stated that due to labor shortages, it is difficult to complete the proportion assigned to each individual on their own responsibility, and it is most appropriate to have a five-person group in rural areas as the lowest-level responsible party.</p>
<p>Mr. Takenosuke Ouchi (President of Hitachi Cement) argued that the final stage of increased production is the resolution of the peasant problem, so he advocated resolutely implementing national management of farmland, forcibly controlling the use of cultivated land, and making significant contributions to the establishment of Japanese rural areas in conjunction with the high degree of land utilization.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Kenzo Aoyama (Member of Parliament) explained that aquatic products are an extremely important source of nutrition for the people, so it is necessary for the state to commend and comfort fishermen who have encountered disasters. The establishment and expansion of the current fishing boat insurance and fishermen's insurance are also urgent tasks in promoting the fishing industry, and these expenses should naturally be borne by the national treasury.

<h3>German Army Uses "Center of Gravity Cannon" on Eastern Front: Tremendous Power Sufficient to Sway the Battle; Fierce Fighting Still Underway in Orel Region</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - It has been repeatedly reported that the German army is using a powerful new weapon, the "center of gravity cannon," on the Eastern Front. Colonel Gross revealed the full picture of this new weapon for the first time in the German military magazine on the 25th. The details are as follows: The tremendous power of this new weapon can indeed sway the battle and make it favorable to our side, hence the name "center of gravity cannon." The strong firepower and portability of the cannon are its characteristics. The cannon body is equipped with six ammunition chambers, equivalent to the firepower of six mortars. The ammunition chamber is made of light steel and is electrically operated, capable of firing six shells in a few seconds. The shells use smokeless gunpowder, so they leave no trace when fired. The shells fired by this cannon are roughly divided into three types. The first type is a grenade, which has extremely strong explosive power, causing many enemy soldiers to die from internal bleeding due to shock. The second type is called a flame bomb, which is a weapon to demoralize enemy troops and burn guard posts, and is often used in forests. The third type is called a spray bomb, which, once fired, creates a large fog to hinder accurate enemy firing.</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from a front-line correspondent of the German News Agency, with the exception of the Orel region, there are currently no major battles in the Eastern Front war zones, due to the heavy losses suffered by the Soviet army in the past few days, leaving them with no remaining strength to reinforce their troops. Furthermore, after the Soviet army on the southern front suffered a defeat in the Kupen bridgehead operation, they shifted their target and attempted to advance towards Novorossiysk. After a fierce artillery bombardment, the Soviet tank units attacked the Romanian military positions in that area, but the Romanian army fiercely attacked, and the Soviet army's attempt was thwarted. The Soviet army on the Mius River and Donets River fronts also launched local offensives, but were defeated by the German army and retreated. Furthermore, the fighting in the Orel region has become increasingly fierce, with the Soviet army repeatedly attacking German positions with elite infantry and tank units. The German counterattack blocked their advance. Of the 177 tanks lost by the Soviet army in the Jin line on the 24th, 163 were destroyed in that area, indicating the success of the German army in that area.</p>
<h3>German Defenses Strong in Northeastern Sicily; Fierce Artillery Battles in Leonforte Area</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to military reporter Plana of the German News Agency, American tanks and infantry attacked several positions on the right flank of the German defensive line in Sicily, hoping to break through, leading to large-scale battles. However, the enemy troops were all defeated and suffered heavy losses. German fighter planes and destroyers made great contributions to the success of this defensive battle, carrying out daring low-altitude attacks and inflicting heavy losses on the American army. American troops were repeatedly thrown into confusion by German aircraft attacks. American movements were also limited by well-disguised Axis minefields and other obstacles. Whenever General Patton's troops approached German positions, they were repelled by the local garrison. American assault troops attacking along the coastal highway east of Palermo also failed. Except for the intensified artillery battles in the Leonforte area, the rest of the front lines were very quiet. In the areas of Gabini and Leonforte, the British and American troops have retreated their positions southward, apparently to avoid suffering heavy losses from further fierce Axis artillery counterattacks. German fighter planes patrolled the entire island of Sicily, defeating two squadrons of British fighter planes and shooting down five British planes, with no German losses. Fast German bombers also attacked enemy supply lines, barracks, and troop movements behind the front lines. A British motor torpedo boat attempted to approach the Strait of Messina but was hit by anti-aircraft fire and caught fire. German heavy bombers attacked the port of Augusta, sinking three enemy landing craft and damaging five enemy cargo ships. Fighting on the Catania front...</p>
<h3>Wallace Claims No Discord With President</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) - U.S. Vice President Wallace stated at the opening of the Detroit Exhibition on Sunday that although President Roosevelt had publicly made unfavorable remarks about him recently, there was no discord with the President. This was Wallace's first public speech since President Roosevelt dissolved the Board of Economic Warfare, which Wallace headed.</p>
<h3>British and American Aircraft Attack Germany; Lose Sixty-One Aircraft</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - The German Air Force authorities announced on the 26th that when large British and American air formations attacked the Ruhr area of western Germany and the coastal area on the 25th, a total of 61 aircraft were shot down, including 52 four-engine heavy bombers. The German Air Force also lost four aircraft.</p>
<h3>British Indian Authorities Take Preventive Measures</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to news arriving locally, after the formation of the Indian National Army, the British, fearing its attack, are constructing fortresses and air defense facilities day and night in Calcutta, as well as street defenses to prevent riots. Two hundred and fifty public air-raid shelters have now been completed in Calcutta. Since the rise of Mr. Kantra Baus, Bombay has been greatly shaken. The British Indian authorities have banned the sale of maps of Bombay State to prevent espionage activities and have confiscated all Indian maps. They have also issued orders prohibiting gatherings of more than five people.</p>
<h3>Trip to Guangzhou</h3>
<p>— Zhou Fohai</p>
<p>From April to June this year, in three months, I traveled north to Harbin, south to Guangzhou, east to Taipei, and west to Wuhan. Because I was flying around in the sky, I can't say I was travel-worn, but I can only say I was swept away by the winds and clouds.</p>
<p>My trip was not a very relaxing or leisurely affair: I had to socialize, give speeches, inspect, make statements, listen to reports, and give instructions. However, I am a lowly person, or it can be said that I am fond of doing good things, and I have no blessing to enjoy leisure and comfort. The busier I am, the better my spirits are, and the more stressed I am, the stronger my body is. Not only do I feel uncomfortable if I have nothing to do for a day, but I also feel restless if I have an hour of free time. Therefore, I am very happy to visit friendly countries or inspect various places, and live a fast-paced and stressful life! The trip to Guangzhou evoked many memories and generated many feelings. On a quiet night by the window, with nothing to do, I specially wrote this record.</p>
<p>Wind and Rain on the Dragon Boat Festival</p>
<p>Originally, I could fly directly from Nanjing to Guangzhou, but because I had things to deal with in Shanghai, I went to Shanghai on the 4th and ordered the plane to fly from Nanjing to Shanghai on the 6th to wait. I set off on the 7th, which was the Dragon Boat Festival in the lunar calendar. Shuhui and my relatives and friends all advised me to leave after the festival. I said that I had already telegraphed Guangzhou and it was inconvenient to change. Coincidentally, the weather was bad for those few days, and they all hoped that the weather would be bad on the 7th and that I wouldn't be able to fly. Indeed, on the 7th, there was a strong wind and heavy rain. It wasn't "wind and rain filling the city approaching the Double Ninth Festival," but wind and rain filling the sky passing the Dragon Boat Festival. Not only could I not leave on the 7th, but the 8th was the same, which really annoyed me. First, because I was going to leave, I neither had old friends to talk to nor plans to manage affairs, and I was forced to sit idle at home for two days. Second, I didn't know when the weather would clear up and when I could leave. When I woke up on the morning of the 9th, the pilot of the plane called and said that it was possible to fly. So, like a pardoned prisoner, I happily went to the airport. The pilot reported that we would fly directly to Guangzhou today, without going through Taipei. We took off at 10:00 AM, and it was very smooth. I fell asleep without realizing it. I don't know how much time passed, but I felt the plane shaking very violently, and I seemed to hear someone among the attendants say, "The wind and rain are really terrible!" I stretched myself and looked out the window, only to see heavy rain hitting the window and heavy fog filling the sky. I was too lazy to care and fell asleep again without realizing it. When I woke up for the second time, I looked at my watch, and it was 12:15 PM. The pilot reported that we could reach Taipei at 1:00 PM in the afternoon. I asked the attendants, "I said we were flying directly to Guangzhou, why are we going through Taipei again?" They all replied that because we encountered storms and rain on the way, we used too much gasoline, and we were afraid it wouldn't be enough to fly to Guangzhou, so we went to Taipei to replenish it. After landing in Taipei, the people at the airport said: "We heard that you were flying directly to Guangzhou, and we were very worried because there is a hurricane near Hong Kong that is moving north." They showed me the weather report map, and a large red circle indicating the hurricane was drawn on the map, which really startled me. They asked me to stay in Taipei and said: "Not only can't you fly today, but you definitely can't fly tomorrow morning. We'll see the situation again in the afternoon." I had no choice but to stay in Taipei. This time was really extremely dangerous. Because I didn't know there was a hurricane when I set off in Shanghai, I decided to fly directly. If I hadn't encountered wind and rain on the way and gone to Taipei to replenish gasoline due to insufficient fuel, I would have encountered the hurricane and wouldn't I have been buried at the bottom of the sea? Life and death are destined, and it can't be said that there isn't a certain plan.</p>
<p>Short Stay in Taipei</p>
<p>The Taiwan Governor-General's Office and the Bank of Taiwan both sent people to take care of me, and first sent us to the Railway Hotel to rest. When I set off in Shanghai, the weather was very cool, but it was extremely hot when I arrived in Taipei, and I felt unwell all over. Near Taipei, there is a mountain more than 3,000 meters high called Grass Mountain, which has excellent hot springs and is a summer resort in Taipei. They sent us up the mountain. The top advisor, Ishiwatari, who was traveling with us, stayed at the guesthouse of the Bank of Taiwan, and I and my attendants stayed at the Governor-General's Office's VIP guesthouse. After going up the mountain, a strong wind and heavy rain began to rush down with a deafening roar. The mountains are densely forested, and when it rains, the valleys roar even more, making people feel frightened. If our tiny plane had encountered such a torrential storm in the sky above the ocean, how could it not have joined the fish and dragons! Thinking about it later, I still feel lingering fear!</p>
<p>I am extremely fond of hot springs, and the hot springs here are sulfurous. As soon as I arrived on the mountain, the smell of sulfur assaulted my nostrils. I took a bath once before dinner and again after dinner, which was extremely comfortable. In the depths of the mountains, listening to the sound of wind and rain at night, I truly had a feeling of transcending the world.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 10th, I received a report that I could not fly all morning or afternoon. So, I went down the mountain with Advisor Ishiwatari to visit the Governor-General's Office and the Bank of Taiwan to thank them for their hospitality. We had lunch at the Bank of Taiwan, and in the afternoon, we visited the museum, the agricultural experiment station, the forestry experiment station, and Taipei Imperial University. Listening to the report from the director of the agricultural and forestry experiment station, I learned about their efforts to improve and develop Taiwan's agriculture and forestry, which made me both admire and envy them. At the Imperial University's Folklore Museum, I saw a lot of information about the lives, customs, and handicrafts of the indigenous people, which I found very interesting, but unfortunately I didn't have time to study them in detail.</p>
<p>On the night of the 10th, there were still drizzle and wind. On the 11th, the wind and rain were even greater. With nothing to do, I was bored to death, and I took a bath three times a day to dispel my worries. At night, listening to the sound of rain on the eaves and the sound of wind in the trees, I truly had the feeling of Wu Zixu passing through Zhaoguan, "My heart feels like it's being fried in hot oil!"</p>
<p>Revisiting Guangzhou</p>
<p>On the morning of the 12th, I was actually able to fly. I went down the mountain to the airport and took off at 11:00 AM. I circled Hong Kong and entered the Pearl River basin. When passing through Hong Kong, I thought of the situation in December of the 27th year when I flew to Kowloon from Hanoi with Gongbo, and Sipin went to the airport to pick us up, which is still vivid in my mind. Unfortunately, I could only look down from the high sky and couldn't revisit the old place. I arrived in Guangzhou at 3:00 PM. Guangzhou, which I had been away from for sixteen years, was actually in front of me. In the past sixteen years, Guangzhou has experienced countless disturbances, ups and downs. It seems that Baiyun Mountain has also aged a lot and no longer has its usual charm.</p>
<p>The first time I went to Guangzhou was in May of the 13th year of the Republic of China, in response to a telegram from Mr. Dai Jitao. I went to Guangzhou on the same boat as Tan Pingshan and stayed in a hotel on Yonghan Road. At that time, the Central Party Headquarters was in Huizhou Guild Hall, and I went there to see Jitao. He wanted me to be the secretary of the Propaganda Department, because the Propaganda Department had recently taken over the Hong Kong Morning Post and wanted me to go to Hong Kong to temporarily reside as the editor-in-chief. For this reason, I had a reporter career for more than a month. At that time, I thought I had no experience in running a newspaper and firmly refused to go. Jitao overestimated me, thinking that I would definitely have a solution if I went, so I had to go and try. At that time, I thought that the editor-in-chief only needed to write one editorial a day, and I didn't know anything about how to choose and arrange news. In less than a month, a small problem arose. There was a news item saying that Jitao was going to be the Director of the Guangdong Political Affairs Department. I didn't know that publishing it would be bad for him, so I published it. He wrote a letter complaining to me, saying that he wasn't an official, didn't I know that? Others wanted to slander him and created this rumor, why did I publish it? Later, several problems also occurred in the editorials. Because I was still a member of the Communist Party at that time, my arguments were of course subject to attack, so I asked to be transferred back to Guangzhou. Today, revisiting the old place, I thought of this karmic connection when I first came here twenty years ago.</p>

<h3>Income Tax to Be Promoted Immediately After Return of Concessions; Earnest Collection from August 1st; Additional Personnel Dispatched to Investigate Merchant Accounts</h3>
<p>It is learned that the Shanghai District Collection Bureau of the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, with the imminent return of the Public Concession and the French Concession and the unification of administrative power, tax administration should be vigorously promoted. In the past, due to the special relationship of the concessions, income tax revenue was repeatedly subject to various obstacles, resulting in merchants resisting the payment of national taxes and concealing their income, and there were many such cases. In order to extend the tax administration in the two special zones and enrich the national treasury, in addition to studying and planning the collection of income tax from foreigners, the bureau has specially supervised its subordinates to earnestly promote various types of income tax from August 1st, and has dispatched additional personnel to investigate merchants and collect the first category of profit-making business income tax based on the account books, and also to collect the unpaid tax for the 30th and 29th years. If there are any who resist payment or conceal their income, they will be handed over to the court for recovery and punishment. It is reported that recently, because merchants are unable to evade taxes after the recovery of the concessions, in order to avoid being punished by the authorities, most of them have voluntarily declared and paid their taxes, so the tax revenue has increased significantly compared to before. According to Director Ge of the bureau, "In the past, many merchants in the two concessions concealed their income and resisted the payment of profit income tax, and due to the privilege of the concessions, the tax administration could not be implemented due to repeated constraints. After the recovery of the concessions, tax collection can be enforced, and every merchant must not be allowed to evade taxes. However, this bureau will never allow merchants to suffer unexpected burdens and pain. In the future, we will investigate accounts and collect taxes in accordance with the law, and strictly urge collection personnel to abide by integrity, so as not to hinder the legitimate interests of merchants and enrich the national treasury revenue."</p>
<h3>Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association Announces Dissolution: Joint Meeting Passes Declaration of Dissolution</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association, considering that the Public Concession will be taken over by the National Government on August 1st, and that the association's mission is completed and there is no need for its continued existence, held a joint meeting of all executive committee members, Chinese directors, and Chinese committee members at the association's premises at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 26th) to honorably dissolve. Mayor Chen of the Municipal Government specially sent Secretary-General Zhao as a representative to participate, and Minister Ding of Social Welfare also attended on time. After Chairman Dong Jicheng presided over the meeting with due ceremony, he reported on the purpose of the dissolution meeting.

<p>Dissolution Declaration</p>
<p>The dissolution declaration of the Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association stated roughly: "The Shanghai Public Concession will be taken over on August 1st of this year, and from now on, administrative sovereignty will be unified. Looking back, this association has always taken seeking the welfare of citizens and negotiating with the Public Works Department as its mission. Now that the Public Works Department has been abolished due to the recovery of the Concession, the mission of this association has also come to an end, and we hereby announce its dissolution before the recovery of the Concession. Considering that this association was established in the ninth year of the Republic and has continued until today, spanning more than twenty years, we have shown the spirit of revolutionary struggle, and engaged in unyielding negotiations with British and American forces. All our achievements are clearly visible to all. At the time of this dissolution, we would like to briefly express our past work and current feelings to the people of the country.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Concession is a product of the Treaty of Nanjing of 1901. Its administrative center is the Public Works Department, and the highest authority of the Public Works Department is the Board of Directors, which is elected by taxpayers. The nine directors are all foreigners, with no Chinese participation. Important officials within the Bureau also rarely have Chinese. Chinese people account for nine-tenths of the citizens in the Concession, and the taxes paid also account for a large part of the Public Works Department's income, but the power to control everything is in the hands of foreigners. The unfairness of this situation need not be elaborated upon. Later, unfortunate incidents occurred from time to time, and the public anger of the citizens could not be restrained, which led to the establishment of this association to fight for the welfare of the Chinese people. This was the event of October 14th, the ninth year of the Republic. Until the May 30th Incident occurred in the fourteenth year, emotions were agitated and the whole country was boiling. This association led the citizens to struggle unremittingly under adverse circumstances, and finally, in March of the seventeenth year, it was decided to add three Chinese directors and six Chinese committee members to the Public Works Department, who were recommended by this association. Senior officials in various departments also had Chinese participation. By the nineteenth year, the number of Chinese directors had increased to five, and the number of Chinese committee members had also gradually increased. Although the administrative power was still in the hands of the British and Americans, the interests of the citizens could be largely preserved. On April 14th of the thirtieth year, a congress of Chinese taxpayers was held, and Chen Jicheng was elected as the vice chairman and acting chairman of this association. The directors and committee members were also re-elected to participate in the Public Works Department. Since then, the work of this association has returned to an active stage. Since the two wars, the struggle has not changed. This is the history of this association from its establishment to the present. The purpose of this association is to protect the legitimate interests of citizens and to confront the British and Americans. The existence of the Concession is ultimately a major blow and difficulty for our country's politics. For the sake of the integrity of national sovereignty and the acquisition of the rights and interests of the Chinese people, the recovery of the Concession is the prelude to the completion of the mission of this association. Today, the Public Concession occupied by the British and Americans, thanks to the assistance of friendly nations and the virtue and prestige of the President, has been scheduled to be recovered on August 1st of this year. The accumulated anger of the Chinese people for decades can be eliminated, the happiness of millions of citizens can be increased, and this association has especially realized its long-cherished wish and can finally rest. The joy is truly indescribable. Furthermore, although the organization of this association will be dissolved from now on, the spirit of our colleagues resisting the British and Americans, as well as the hard work of assisting the authorities to seek happiness and benefit, will not only not be eliminated, but should be continuously promoted and developed, in order to make it permanent, in order to make it great, so that the aggressive forces of the British and Americans can no longer have a foothold in our Great Shanghai, and the Shanghai municipal administration after administrative unity can become more progressive and more brilliant, both to illuminate the supreme glory of the Chinese people and to repay the infinite kindness of friendly nations. This is what this association wishes to express its fervent expectations and earnest hopes at the time of its dissolution."</p>
<h3>Tram Conductors Must Treat People Politely: To Prevent Crowding, Station Barriers Will Be Installed</h3>

The Baojia authorities in each district are now planning to stipulate the injection dates for residents of each Bao or each Jia. Residents of each household should report to the office, and the Baojia chief in charge will lead the team to the police station in the area to apply for epidemic prevention injections. Evasion under false pretenses is not allowed. As for the previously issued epidemic prevention certificates, they will all be abolished. Those who request their own doctors to administer the injections must present a certificate.

<p>Various Circles Prepare to Celebrate</p>

As a temporary motion, in order to celebrate the return of the Shanghai Concession, a telegram of respect was sent to the Chairman.</p>
<p>The Nanshi District has always been a prosperous commercial area. After the war, the failure to widely open the iron gates of the French Concession has hindered traffic and greatly affected the recovery of various industries. Recently, the French Concession under exclusive control has been taken over by the National Government on a scheduled basis. In the future, not only will traffic be able to restore to its original state before the war, but the area will naturally have no boundaries. The revitalization and prosperity of the Nanshi District is promising. Therefore, various agencies in the Nanshi District will hold a grand celebration from the date of implementation of the takeover, and are now actively preparing.</p>
<p>The Shanghai All Circles Representatives Celebration for the Recovery of the Concession Anti-British and Anti-American Conference was jointly launched by the Municipal Propaganda Office and the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau. Within days, it was actively carried out. The preparatory committee convened all Baojia committees and youth departments in the city at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 26th) at the Social Welfare Bureau to discuss celebration matters related to Baojia departments.</p>

<p>Teaching Tai Chi to Raise Money for Scholarships</p>
<p>This newspaper received a letter from Mr. Fu Zhongwen yesterday: "At present, living costs in Shanghai are soaring, and most parents feel that it is difficult to make ends meet, and they have no extra energy to allow their children to study, so many students will suffer from the pain of dropping out of school. In response to this newspaper's scholarship campaign, I am willing to do my best to contribute money and effort. I will teach Tai Chi in my spare time and raise money to contribute to this newspaper's scholarship fund." Mr. Fu has a good understanding of Tai Chi.

<p>More Donations Reduce Dropouts</p>
<p>This year, there are a large number of student applicants at all levels, and the scholarship funds are insufficient. We are grateful for the generous donations from all walks of life in recent days. Every day, when colleagues read the amount of donations, they feel relieved to see many poor students carrying their schoolbags again and entering the school. We hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will continue to donate with the bodhisattva mind that helping with education is the most virtuous and the most joyful thing, so that more donations will mean fewer dropouts.

<p>The Shanghai Office of the Postal Administration wrote in a letter: "I have read the article in the Shenbao (26th of this month) about the conversation between the reporter of the Guofeng News Agency and Director Li of our office. After reviewing the conversation at that time, there are two points that differ from the report: (1) Currently, all duties of the Postal Administration are handled by this office under orders. The reporter's statement that the Postal and Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Construction is responsible for managing the national postal service is not correct. (2) Since the postal rate increase on June 1st, the monthly increase in revenue has been 100,000 yuan. In fact, the director of this office did not mention this point. This letter is to request a correction."</p>

<h3>Shanghai's First Orphanage: A Tour of the Tushanwan Orphanage</h3>
<p>There are two paths after graduation: one is to work in the orphanage and obtain the qualification of "old steward," that is, a formal worker. The other is to have the orphanage introduce a job. Over the decades, a large number of graduates of the orphanage have obtained excellent positions in various factories in Shanghai. As for the old members, they also account for a large part of the current workers in various departments of the orphanage, and many people have become specialized technicians, who are welcomed by the industrial sector.</p>
<p>In addition to high and junior (missing content) (that is, special classes), Lanyun Elementary School has specially established a school for deaf and dumb orphans to conduct special education. The first step is to understand gestures, mouth shapes, and pronunciations, and then teach all the basic courses. The second step is to learn (missing content). Because deaf and dumb orphans can concentrate on learning, their achievements can not only compete with those who are not deaf and dumb, but also produce many outstanding talents. It is said that the best of the orphanage's handicrafts are made by deaf and dumb graduates. This is a fact worth studying by educators.</p>
<h3>A Grand View of Religious Culture</h3>
<p>The Tushanwan Orphanage occupies an area of 63 acres on Puxi Road. In addition to the four departments (missing content) Ciyun School, the eastern part is completely opened as a workshop.

Who would believe that this is an orphanage?</p>
<p>Walking into the gate, the old building on (missing content) is (missing content), which can be regarded as the best (missing content) and most prosperous part of the orphanage. The (missing content) is especially complete. In addition to stone printing, color printing, various (missing content), the (missing content) quad machine and the folio machine are also running, swallowing white paper and spitting out the "(missing content) Guangbao" and other magazines, English and French textbooks, and books related to religion, culture, and history. There are also various ancillary equipment that a complete printing house should have, such as Chinese and Western word processors, typewriter-style electric typesetting machines (English, Latin), and a not-so-small Chinese and Western manual typesetting room. How many famous newspapers and bookstores in our country are not as complete as the printing of this orphanage? The Chinese and Western books and newspapers they have printed over the years have long been praised in China, Europe, and the United States. In particular, the printing price is lower than the general market price, and there is no mercantile spirit of general cultural and industrial businesses. As long as it does not violate morals, they welcome printing books, newspapers, and magazines as long as they can. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Comments from the Economic Circle</p>
<h3>Emergency Countermeasures in Economic Circles</h3>
<p>After Mr. Masatsune Ogura, head of the Japanese-Chinese Economic Survey Mission, returned to Tokyo, he stated to reporters: "The urgent countermeasures for the current Chinese economy are, firstly, the price issue, and secondly, the food issue... Domestic prices in China are rising sharply. The reason for this is hoarding. The current countermeasures must strengthen organizations such as purchasing and distribution... and appropriate measures should be taken economically and legally. Furthermore, the key to solving the food problem lies in improving purchasing methods and developing desolate land through appropriate guidance to increase production." These words are Mr. Ogura's diagnosis of the ailments of the Chinese economy.</p>
<p>Studying Mr. Ogura's remarks in detail, it is deeply felt that the focus of China's current two major urgent economic problems—stabilizing prices and solving the food supply—lies in strengthening purchasing and distribution. Strengthening distribution naturally requires strengthening purchasing as a prerequisite, and strengthening purchasing requires cracking down on speculation and hoarding of goods as its initial task. Therefore, it is necessary to highly strengthen the economic control implementation mechanism, with the National Commercial Control Association, the Goods Investigation Committee, and the Goods Control Review Committee as its core, so that it can break through the strongholds of goods hoarding. We believe that taking strict legal steps is the only essential element for "strengthening purchasing and distribution organizations."</p>
<h3>Goods Investigation Committee to Implement Financial Inspections, Gradual Understanding of Warehouses</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Continental News, at 3 PM on the 23rd, the Goods Investigation Committee held its second meeting. Attendees included Chairman Chen Gongbo, Minister Tajiri, Colonel Okada, Zhao Zunyue, Yuan Yuqian, Wang Zhigang, and over ten others. They conducted detailed and specific discussions on the fundamental policy for handling investigations, the expansion of investigation teams, the disposition of investigation results, the strengthening of investigation official meetings, the establishment of rewards for confidential reports, etc. It is said that the current major issues in promoting the goods investigation include the following points: (1) Gradually implementing</p>
<p>Financial Inspections</p>
<p>Since the launch of investigation activities on the 13th, the inventory situation in various business warehouses has gradually become clear. For example, in a certain warehouse, there were a total of 8,000 pieces of cotton yarn and cloth. The financial institutions behind the owners were therefore found as clues to hoarding, and financial inspections are therefore inevitable. It is still remembered that the so-called first , for (A) the sales of... coupons, (B) multiple items... share of sales... Prohibited items are (1) , (2) Purchase or accept pledge of Yi Mao... tickets, but... repayment of debts... receipt of the... to... within... points, with the place... as people..., five at... party and overturning the sale of securities, after the decision of the first directors' meeting.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Stipulates Capital Standards for Banking and Money Industries</h3>

The capital of financial institutions organized as unlimited liability companies must be at least 2 million yuan, but the Ministry will reduce this amount based on local conditions. For the sake of convenience, the temporary reduction standards are as follows: (1) The capital of financial institutions organized as limited liability companies, limited partnerships, or joint-stock limited partnerships shall be in accordance with the following provisions: (A) In Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Bengbu, Wuhu, Xuzhou, and other places, it shall not be less than 2 million yuan (according to company regulations, 1/2 of capital can be collected to operate).

<h3>Shoe Covers and Running Shoes Can Be Purchased in Both Sunny and Rainy Weather</h3>
<p>According to the rubber industry, which previously had a shortage of raw materials, regulations stipulated that stores could only sell shoe covers on rainy days and running shoes on sunny days. Customers were required to present their citizen's card and seasonal housing tax receipt, and old shoes had to be exchanged. Now, the method has been slightly changed, that is, shoe covers and running shoes can be purchased regardless of sunny or rainy weather. However, each store is required to limit the daily quantity to be sold until it is sold out. As for other items such as housing tax receipts, citizen's cards, and old shoes, they will still be handled as before.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Gold and Silver: Jewelry gold shops in the gold and silver industry can be exchanged at two prices, although at the limited price, the handling fee is still the same, but all exchanges have been stopped. There are no transactions in the industry, and the off-market price has exceeded the nine mark again. People are uneasy, and transactions are not active. The off-market price of silver is the same as last Saturday.</p>
<p>Government Bonds: The five types of unified government bonds, A, B, C, D, and E bonds, have risen in the black market, but the number is very small, and transactions are not active.</p>

Longtou fine cloth fell several yuan again, Sijunzi pique rose slightly, Taohua ladies' cloth rose significantly, Bai Mao calico fell rapidly, and Sanyang pique fell slightly.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn: Due to the difficulty in obtaining mobile certificates recently, the Luying market is sluggish, and prices have fallen slightly. The 42-count double-strand Blue Phoenix and the 20-count single-strand Shuangma are slightly lower.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities: Under the stability of public sentiment, prices continue to rise, such as the resale of soap and matches at new prices, especially Yinben soap and Phoenix matches are the highest, foreign candles are still mild, and cigarettes are booming. All brands on the market are favored by customers.</p>
<h3>Dynamics of Various Industry Associations</h3>
<p>Real Estate Industry: The Shanghai Special City Real Estate Industry Association held its inaugural meeting at the Banking Association on the 24th of this month. More than 120 companies participated. Director Zhu Boquan, the preparatory director, served as chairman. Preparatory Committee member Sun Chunsheng and others reported. Then, Wang Shuzhi, a representative of the Economic Bureau, and others gave speeches. After passing the articles of association, Zhu Boquan, Chen Renze, Sun Chunsheng, and 14 others were elected as directors, and Li Shuxiong, Bei Chunbo, and Li Qing and six others were elected as supervisors.</p>
<p>Brewing Industry: The Brewing Industry Association felt that the original office address was cramped and insufficient, so it surveyed and determined 113 Glock Road as the new address of the association, and moved to that address yesterday (the 26th) for office work. Furthermore, recently, the selling price of alcohol has risen sharply, which is obviously due to someone manipulating hoarding, so it has specially reported to the Grain Bureau, requesting a thorough investigation and crackdown.</p>
<p>Button Industry: The preparations for the Button Industry Association have been completed. Yesterday (the 26th), the inaugural meeting was held at the Ningbo Fellow Association. A very enthusiastic number of representatives attended the meeting. Qian Kongzhu, Xiang Benhao, and seven others were elected as directors, and Zhang Zhicheng and two others were elected as supervisors. They then took office temporarily and had their pictures taken.</p>

<h3>Trip to Guangzhou, Continued from the Second Edition</h3>
<p>Governor Chen Dezhao of Guangdong Province sent me to the guest house of the provincial government. On the way, we passed through Dongshan, where I used to live. My house was near a large golf course, but now not only is the house gone without a trace, but even the golf course is nowhere to be seen. We passed the old provincial council, which used to be the headquarters of the Guangdong Army, and Dong school field, which used to be where the Northern Expedition was sworn in. Now they have all changed, completely changed. We passed Wende Road, Yonghan Road, and many unknown roads, and arrived at a place. Dezhao told me this was Sima Lu. Sima Lu? It is completely different from the mysterious Xiguan that we outsiders thought of twenty years ago! At that time, there were no roads in Xiguan, but old-fashioned streets paved with large pieces of green stone. There were wooden fences separating it from the roads. At that time, the Chamber of Commerce took this as its base. We thought that Xiguan was the base of the comprador class against the revolution, and thought it was a mysterious lair. Now that the road is open, the mystery is exposed, and after the incident, it has become a prosperous center, very lively. Finally, we arrived at the guest house. I told Dezhao that I used to take a small boat from Tianzi Wharf to Lychee Bay to play, and I remembered that the scenery was very good. Now I want to go there again. He said, "Isn't this Lychee Bay?" It turned out that Lychee Bay had long become a residential area. It is really a sea change, and I am still dreaming.</p>
<p>Enjoying the Moon on the Pearl River</p>
<p>The first pleasant thing to do in Guangzhou was to go to Shamian to enjoy the night moon over the Pearl River. On the evening of the 12th, I accepted a banquet from Madam Wang.</p>
<p>Madam Wang said that Shamian has already been arranged. The moonlight is very good tonight, so we can go to Shamian to enjoy the moon. So, I followed Madam Wang and Dezhao to Shamian. Shamian! Arriving here, I thought of the Shameen Massacre fourteen years ago. In the past, this small place was the base for British and American aggression in Guangdong. Now they have been driven out, and the flag of the Blue Sky and White Sun is flying over this area. The Citibank has also become the Central Reserve Bank. We entered from the West Bridge and exited from the East Bridge. We circled around the Pearl River along the riverbank. In the moonlight and waves, looking at Baietan in the distance, and Henan across the river, reflecting on the past and present, I couldn't help but feel fascinated.</p>
<p>Inspecting Schools</p>
<p>I inspected many factories and schools in Guangzhou, and reviewed the army, police, and youth groups. They all had a very vigorous and upward atmosphere. What moved me the most was the work-study school organized by Madam Wang. This school is all about taking in orphans without parents. The oldest is only twelve or thirteen years old, and the youngest is only two or three years old. Their actions are all under military management. I saw that their standing at attention, saluting, and other actions were all very accurate. Although I am not a soldier, I have been in the army for four or five years because I was in charge of military political training. I deeply feel that our daily life must be militarized to be disciplined and energetic. I often pay attention to how people stand when they bow and salute. Most of them have their feet apart, but the way they are apart is different. Some have their left foot in front and their right foot behind, and some are the opposite. Some have their left and right feet together, but still apart, and some have their feet close together, but they are not standing at attention, but putting their feet together like chopsticks. Also, when saluting, you must look at the other person, which is called "attention." But many people look elsewhere when they salute. I don't know who they are saluting. Although this is a small detail, it can prove that our daily actions are not trained, so they are not neat and undisciplined. Now, seeing these young boys and girls, not only are they innocent and lively and agile, but every action is very accurate. This is of course the result of serious training. In addition, the practice of labor and the organization of self-government are all worth learning from. I hope that children in all regions will use this as a model for training.</p>
<p>Visiting the Spirits at Huanghuagang</p>
<p>On the morning of the 15th, I went to Huanghuagang to respectfully pay homage to the spirits of the 72 martyrs. Huanghuagang, it has been twenty years since I visited it with Shu Ci in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China until this year. In these twenty years, the country has experienced many changes, and I have experienced many worries. In the current situation, the country is still torn apart, and the unfulfilled will of the 72 martyrs is not completely realized. I am still the same, and I have not accomplished anything. Reaching the holy place again, I cannot help but feel a sense of home and country. Where can one predict the encounters in life? At that time, the person who buried the loyal bones of the 72 martyrs was Mr. Yan Mengfan. He was the prefect of Guangzhou Prefecture at that time and was a capable officer. At that time, I was just a village schoolboy in a private school. How could I have known that thirty years later, I would be the Minister of Finance and he would be the Vice Minister, and that we would have three years of colleagueship?</p>
<p>From Huanghuagang to Guanyin Mountain. Before I returned to Guangzhou, I was very concerned about whether the Zhenhai Tower on Guanyin Mountain, commonly known as the Five-Story Building, still existed after the war. When I got there, although the remains were still there, they were already badly damaged. This building was built on the old site of the Nanyue Palace in the early Ming Dynasty. Our Hunan predecessor, Peng Gangzhi, once wrote a couplet: "Ten thousand catastrophes, the perilous building still exists. I ask who picked stars from the Dipper, looking down on the past and present." "Where are the five hundred years of old lords?" It made me lean on the railing and look at my sword, shedding tears for the heroes! This couplet was destroyed in the mutiny. Mr. Hu Hanmin rewrote it and wrote his own couplet: "The Five Ridges come from the north, the Pearl Sea is most suitable for moonlit nights." "Looking at the evening clouds, the old residence is still autumn in the Han Dynasty." Now they are all destroyed, leaving only the relics for future generations to mourn. Climbing the Memorial Tower, looking at the towering Baiyun Mountain in the back and the Pearl River winding in front, hundreds of thousands of families, with wisps of smoke from cooking fires, I felt refreshed and full of pride. Although I dare not have the concept of Peng Gangzhi looking down on the past and present, I felt tears for the heroes.</p>
<p>Going down the mountain from the Memorial Tower, passing a place halfway up the mountain, there is a stele erected, with the inscription Mr. Sun's Place for Reading and Governance, which is where Chen Jiongming shelled when he rebelled. I revisited this place on the eve of the 21st anniversary of the Prime Minister's disaster. Recalling the Prime Minister's escape, and the situation of using a warship to resist the rebellious army, I increased my admiration and worship.</p>
<p>Watching a Play at Haizhu</p>
<p>On the last night in Guangzhou, because all the tasks had been completed, the comrades of the provincial government invited me to the Haizhu Theater to watch a Cantonese opera. Speaking of watching a play, I am very interested. I have three great regrets in my life. I love reading poetry the most but I cannot write it, I love landscape paintings the most but I cannot paint it, and I love listening to Peking Opera the most but I cannot sing it. I really want to be able to write poetry, paint, and sing opera. I envy others who can do these things very much. But I don't have the talent for these things, and I'm afraid these three great regrets will never be compensated for in my life.</p>
<p>I can understand Cantonese pretty well, and I understand the dialogue. The lyrics, because Madam Wang asked someone to buy me a book, and I checked the ancient texts while listening, I naturally understood everything. The play was called "Autumn Regret on a Journey," and the lyrics were very good. It is the most famous play in Guangdong, describing a love affair during the time when Hong Yang was about to rise up. Therefore, I felt very interested in watching it. I feel that the love of the ancients was literary, and the love of today's young men and women is scientific. Therefore, the love affairs of the ancients can move people, while the love of modern people is completely mechanical and cannot move people. I think everything can be scientific, but only love cannot be scientific. Scientific love is really dry and tasteless. In his article "Prejudice" published in the previous issue of this magazine, Gongbo said that the most common question between men and women in their first love is "Do you really love me?" "I really love you." "What do you love about me?" "I don't know either." "Since you don't know, why do you love me?" "If I could say it, it wouldn't be true love." It's definitely not wrong, this is the common question and answer in the early stages of love. But I want to add two more sentences, which are "Can you love me like this forever?" "Of course, it's forever, I'll love you until the day I die." "I'm afraid you're the same with others." "Absolutely not, I feel that there is no one else in the world worth loving except you." This is almost a fixed formula like a uniform. This kind of love that is talked about in the formula of geometric algebra is scientific love. In fact, no matter who you are, if you ask him if he really loves you, even if he doesn't really love you, how can he not swear to God that it is true? Maybe he has two or three lovers at the same time, or even five or six lovers, but if you ask him if he is the same with others, he will definitely say that he only loves you. Scientific love is unreliable and tasteless, how can it compare to the taste of love with literary significance, with deep affection and heart-to-heart sympathy? If it is too far from the subject, let's stop here.</p>
<p>The weather on the 16th was very good, and we flew straight back to Shanghai from Guangzhou. Although it was only a four-day stay, the sixteen years of separation was quite comforted by this. (Han Zai's "Past and Present" Semi-Monthly Special Summer Issue)</p>
<h3>No Summer This Year</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>Dr. Li, who used to complain every summer, is surprisingly calm this year. I no longer hear him complaining about dizziness and distress. After inquiring, it turned out that Dr. Li has been taking "Brain-Kidney Ding" tablets recently. From this, the great efficacy of this product can be seen in general. No wonder company pharmacies call "Brain-Kidney Ding" a long-lasting seller.</p>
