<p>社評</p>
<h3>我們的鏡子</h3>
<p>日本大政翼贊會，以完遂決戰生產及實踐決戰生活爲二大目標，舉行第四屆中央協力會議，集合各地民間代表討論種種實際間題，同時政府關係官吏列席說明政府意旨與推行方策，即席表示尊重與接受會議所決定的建議。會議結束，距今雖已半月，因會議經過，當時雷訊報道簡略，未窺全貌。頃從日文每日新聞摘譯議案披露，（分載本報二十七至二十九日）以見一斑。</p>
<p>何謂完遂決戰生產？就是爭取決戰勝利所必需的一種力量，這一種力量是取給於生產方面的，所以，必須完遂之。何謂實踐決戰生活？就是爭取決戰勝利所必需的又一種力量，這又一種力量是包含於全體國民生活的，所以必須實踐之。也可以說前者是物力，後者是人力，是爭取戰爭勝利的兩大要素。友邦日本對於大東亞戰爭之勝利，視爲東亞全民族解放所繫，不辭艱鉅，全國上下一心一德，向一個目標邁進。凡是足以增强戰力的事物，無論鉅細，莫不以最大毅力去研究去書踐，同時，隨時隨地重視因時間與宅間所產生不同的環境變化，而立即採取不同的對策適應之。在這種處理方針之下，任何經常的以及突發的困難，都可以很迅速地克服，絕不會手足無措或是茫無頭緒，我們並非說日本什麼都盡善盡美。不過上面所說的關於日本政府與人民打成一片，忠於國是的事實，我們必須正確認識，尤其在我們國事蜩蟾內外情勢迫急的今天，更需要以坦白態度，取人之長，補我之短。</p>
<p>我們和日本已經站在同一戰綫上，日本所需要的完遂決戰生產與實踐戰時生活，毋寗說我們的需要更感迫切，因爲目前日本的戰時生產力量，戰時國民生活，如果與我們比較，其間的距離，我們實在落後太遠了。當然需要迎頭趕上，以期距離的接近。所以，這次日本中央協力會議，我們應該當作一面鏡子，詳細的對照一番，必須照出所有一切的汚穢之點，加以澈底的洗滌與整容。</p>
<p>這次會議議案討論的範圍，包含官民協力，國民動員，企業整備，食糧增產，革新教育，科學技術等，而歸納於完遂決戰生產與實踐決戰生活的兩大目標。各代表所提供的意見，都是針對實際困難的切實對策，不因瑣屑而不提，不作高遠的空議，完全在熱烈情緒下，交換意見，相互論證，尤其値得注意。</p>
<p>關於議案中可供我們借鏡之處頗多，擇要列舉如次：</p>
<p>（一）集中勞力補充，一致視爲急務。爲完途決戰生產，不論男女，應一體振作勤勞精神。主張設置國家產業預備隊二種，其一爲保持勞動者數量的預備隊，其二爲適應特殊技能的預備隊。這樣，即可不受任何情形的阻滯，不會發生勞動者缺乏，生產减低的現象。</p>
<p>（二）企業整備方面，重工業部門政府雖計劃利用若干民營工廠爲特定軍需品之生產，而無適切的指導方針，亦未設定標準價値，任令主辦者與廠方自由計値，致財產價格發生不正常的騰貴，而阻害增强生產，亟應確定調整對策。這種民間對於政府無指導方針而加以公開的指摘，同時，政府關係官吏即席表示鄭重考慮，民意旣有發揮的機會，政府更有坦白接受的誠意，這就是政府與人民打成一片，發生渾然力量的關鍵所在。</p>
<p>（三）糧食增產國內自給問題，各議員均從長期間親身所獲的經騐與專門學識，並參酌現况，作各個方面交換意見，認爲增產上最直接的障害是農業技術，肥料，勞力缺乏諸問題，農林省决官並說明政府處理方針，於是商討如何以農業技術指導引爲急務。肥料問題已在前次會議中即與五大重要產業同樣看待，惟肥料運動亦應積極實施，兩者相輔而行，始能打破現狀。對於確立農忙時期非常勞力動員問題，在每一村鎭設置食糧國內自給增產委員會，調整勞力供求關係，以村鎭長爲委員長，賦予徵用勞力權，實行有計劃的配置。我們知道日本的糧食產量是不敷國內需要的，但竭力設法增產以期國內自給，而肥料問題在我們農村的習慣，似乎不當一回事的，而他們依據事實上的重要性，就與五大產業等量齊觀。這種實事求是的精神，就是克服困難的特微。勞力供求不調，則賦予村鎭長以徵用特權而有計劃地配置，所謂人盡其材，物盡其用者，殆亦無逾於此。</p>
<p>（四）官民協力與國民動員，從種種教育訓練方式促成之。對於徵用一點，則政府儘力避免，認爲微用固然是勞務上最容易的方法，但精神方面的影饗實極重大。寗使國民自動的振發勤勞報國精神。觀乎日本國民向來熱烈的愛國觀念，自足鼓動國民自發情緒，政府縱不採取徵用方式，也可得徵用之實效。這當然也非偶然倖致的事。</p>
<p>我們不必多加列舉。同時，適於彼者也未必盡宜於我。可是，他們政府與人民的合作精神，無疑的可給我們全部接受的。我們期望同胞們勉力仿效日本國民忠勤國事的熱心，同時，我們更期望政府當局加倍振奮，克盡領導的本能，戰爭勝利與國家復興，全繫於斯！</p>

<h3>日德義三國　貫徹作戰不變　義國駐日大使印德里　照會日外相聲明此旨</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　義駐日大使館，於二十八日下午就該國此次政變發表聲明，指出義國對於日德義三國共同貫徹戰爭之努力，將因此政變而使國內總力團結態勢，益臻强化。大意謂，義國內閣之更迭，對於義國之國際關係，就中關於日德義三國所遂行之戰爭目的，並不因此而變更。義首相巴特里奧元帥之聲明，亦已闡明戰爭仍將繼續進行。現義國所經騐之狀態，因義國離開歐洲大陸中心之地理的位置，故其國內問題，當然與日德兩國之立塲不同。義國最近之政變，完全因此種理由。新內閣之目的，端在更加集結國家總力。義國現於陸海空三方面受敵人攻擊，義國領土之一部巳被美軍侵入，反之日德兩國，則均在遠離本土之地域與敵人作戰。如設想及此，卽可明瞭義國之特殊的立塲。義國雖經此次政變，但義軍之優秀性，並未絲毫减視，又與德國之密切協力，不但不受阻害，且此後反將增强此事觀義軍在西西里島西錢之果敢抵抗實爲最好證據。義國之作戰，並非爲法四斯蒂，亦非擁護德國，實爲義國國民之神聖權利與將來之保證，義國國民毋須巴特里奧內閣發動警戒措置，依然保持良好秩序，由此可證明新內閣，已獲得法西斯蒂出身之成人靑年，及全國國民之支持擁護云</p>
<p>東京廿七日中央社電　此次義大利政變消息，最初係由羅馬廣播電台於廿五日下午十時五十五分發表，惟當時羅馬與東京間之電訊聯絡，曾一度暫告隔絕。至廿八日外務省始接駐義日高大使公電，據該公電內容而觀，義外部曾於廿五日下午十時中，由總辦公處長將義政府更迭之聲明書，義王布告及新首相巴特里奧之布告等面交各國駐義大公使，而巴特里奧元帥，且於是晚八時半，特懇請盟邦使節日高大使舉行會談，並說明此次奉國王之命，拜任首相云。松義國駐日大使印德里，已曾於廿七日正式照會日重光外相，聲明義國對日德義三國共同貫澈戰爭之方針，並不因此次政變而有何變化。茲觀日高大使來電，可知日義兩國於此次義國政變之前，在羅馬仍保持極緊密之聯絡。</p>
<h3>慶祝收回滬租界　蔡大使舉行茶會</h3>
<p>東京廿八日中央社電　我國駐日大使蔡培氏，因上海法租界及公共和界即將於七月三十日及八月一日實行收同，我國上下數十年來之熱望，已於此得以實現，故爲慶祝起見，特定八月一日下午三時，假此間丸之內大東亞會館，招待日本朝野名流，舉行慶祝茶會，聞屆時出席者，約有三百餘人，預料必有一番盛况。</p>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　我國駐日記者團爲慶祝國府收囘上海兩租界，並歡迎駐日蔡大使，特於二卞八正午假此間帝國飯店舉行賽會，到蔡大使，謝公使，及日大本營谷　陸軍報道部長，情報局堀策三部長，大東亞省大政　贊會代表等共四十餘人，席間並由記老團代表及蔡大使等分別致辭，直二時餘始散。</p>
<h3>義大利新閣員　已宣誓就職　新外長現仍在土即將返國</h3>
<p>羅馬廿八日中央社電　據畢可洛報載，義大利新內閣，本日已宣誓就職，各閣員於舉行儀式後，即行視事。</p>
<p>羅馬廿八日中央社電　義大利官方於星期二宣布義大利政府之更迭。旣非革命，亦非政變、僅係一憲政上之危機，已依憲法上之方法解決。政府首長，巳依照大法西斯黨會議之表決，向義王陛下提出辭職，政府之更迭，係依照憲法實行，義王根據法西斯黨會議大多數之動議，已採取憲法上之措施，接收國防之最高指揮及政府之最高權力。義大利之外交政策，並無變更，義大利將守其諾言，並將如巴特里奧元帥所宣布，繼績作戰，義大利之對外政策，並不受此次事件之影響。義大利將仍向前進。大法西斯黨會議所關切者，僅爲內政，前任政府首長，現仍享有其所應享之權利，義大利各城鎭，已完全恢復法律與秩序，生活已恢復正常云。</p>
<p>伊斯坦布廿八日中央社電　前義大利駐土耳其大使，新任義外長之加里利亞男爵，將儘速自土耳其啓程返國。加氏現在伊斯坦布，星期二晨，土外長尙曾在其夏季寓邸，延見加氏。</p>
<p>羅馬廿八日中央社電　據羅馬無綫電播稱，羅馬民衆，曾在街道上舉行盛大示威運動，表示歡迎巴特里奧政府。義京之公共生活，巳恢復正常，各辦事處皆已照常辦公，道路交通仍無阻碍，糧食供應，亦照常配給，民衆極守紀律，並遵守軍事常局之命令。</p>

<p>柏林二十八日中央社電　據海通社訊，德國政治報告申稱，柏林現正密切注意義大利所發生之事件，墨索里尼之辭職，與夫巴特里奧元帥之繼任首相，乃非常重大之政治演變，此乃任何人弗能否認。當然此項演變，亦與德義關係有關，蓋德義兩國多年以來甘苦相共，主義相同，有同樣革命歷史，有相若政治機構，尤其希特勒與墨索里尼兩領袖，更有深切之友誼，此種關係是否能不受目前義大利政治演變之影響，惟將來事實可以證明，以現階段而言，較兩領袖個人關係及兩國共同主義更重要者，厥爲兩國民族爲保衛歐洲作戰之共同命運、須知英美財閥及蘇聯共產主義之宣戰，乃對付德義兩國之民族，並非僅對付兩國之領袖，或兩國之政治組織，事實上英義對於法西斯主義之制度，固模仿不遺餘力也。墨索里尼雖去職，而英美與論之反應，不過如此，卽足證明英美蘇作戰之對象，非兩國之領袖，乃兩國之民族，英美報章現對義國首相巴特里奧亦橫施攻擊，與常日攻擊墨索里尼正符相同，足見義大利今日之作戰，非爲保持法西斯主義，乃爲義國前途及義大利民族而戰，領袖何人，不過義大利國內問題而已。</p>
<p>柏林廿八日中央社電　據海通社訊、義國之局勢旣已明朗。德當局對義國政局之態度，亦漸能確定，義國政府之改組，對德國人民影響甚大，因德義之聯盟，（一）係由於希特勒與墨索里尼之個人友誼，（二）爲兩洋大革命黨理想之一致，自俾斯麥時代迄今，受有政治訓練之德國人，均洞悉德義間有共何之利益，德義人民均能牢記、常義國在阿比西尼亞欲求其生存利益時、曾遭邁協約國之反對，予以擁義者。僅德國耳。德義之共同利益，爲擴張生活空間，以經濟自足自給，獲致獨立合理取用世界之富源，保守歐洲，不受外來勢力所影響。凡愛國之義人，均不願卸去義國成爲現代强國所應負之責任，此點已由義王及新首相鄭重聲明之，極權國家重要人員之更迭鳥絕非國家重要利益亦將改變。</p>
<p>美國態度</p>
<p>里斯本二十八日中央社電　據華盛頓來電、自宮昨日舉行之招待記者席上羅　福總統對義大利事件作首次之評論，渠　實美對義大利之態度未容變更，按羅斯福總統答覆關於此事之間題時，謂國務卿赫爾於星期一所申言之美國政府不變之態度已足以解釋美國之態度矣。</p>
<h3>日潛艇擊沉　敵甲級巡洋艦</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日海軍潛艇作戰之範圍，已廣及太平洋全域，北至阿留申，南迄澳洲，東則遠達美洲沿岸。在此水域以內，無處不爲日潛挺之活動區域，出沒洋面，到處狙擊敵軍艦船，其勞苦實非言語所可形容。且因無綫電探知機之發達，及飛機哨戒範圍之增大，潛艇爲補充動力，雖夜間亦頗雖浮出水面。自敵軍開始反攻以來，日美兩軍以新佐治亞島爲中心之激鬥，已達項點。敵軍且改以必死決心，積極增援，在此戰况下，日潛艇口口，曾不畏犧牲，深入敵地，不分晝夜，搜索敵踪，迄七月二十日下午，該潛艇因潛航過久，艦內空氣混濁已極，預備淸凈空氣，開始放出酵素等號令，時時傳來，在此酷暑中，艦長正親就潛望鏡探視，故浮出海面之潛望鏡，一下不停，突然警戒電鐘，鳴於艇內，全體艦員乃即於極度緊張中，配置妥當，此蓋因艦長已發見有舊金山型甲級巡洋艦一艘，於驅逐艦三艘護衛下，正於嚴重之警衛下航行中，其時日潛艇即佔取有利們置，靜待狙擊，預來突破敵方警戒等，直擊敵重巡洋艦，乃開始侵入射程以內，時水巾聽音器，時時注意於敵艦隊之推進，並準備魚雷戰鬥艦長，幷下決心，於敵前嚴密探視潛望鏡，其時正佔絕好位置，於是艦長遂下令準備射擊，警鐘鳴聲不止，迨一經照準，艦長即下令射擊，此時警鐘戞然而止，數發魚雷疾馳而去，一秒二秒，於緊張中靜候　中聲音之傳來，時間經過極久，旋有沉重之命中聲音傳來數决，此聲亦即大爆炸音，在此一瞬間，舊金山型敵甲級巡洋艦，已被擊沉。該艦總噸數爲九千九百五卞噸，速率三十三海浬，裝有三十九糎砲九門，敵軍巨艦旣沉，各護衛之驅逐艦，乃頻頻向水中投下深水炸彈，企圖反擊，但日潛艦艇巳於海底高奏凱歌轉舵他航。</p>
<h3>德駐日大使　晤日外相</h3>

<p>斯德哥爾摩二十八日中央社電　今日下院中有人提出問題，謂義大利如同意光榮之屈伏時，　國及其盟國，能交還其前北非屬地吾。外相艾登答以簡單之「吾」字。</p>
<h3>巴勒摩東部沿岸　兩軍展開激戰　喀太尼亞東部英軍攻勢　爲軸心軍猛烈反擊所阻</h3>
<p>斯德哥爾摩二十八日中央社電　據西西里島前綫消息，英第人軍於喀太尼亞東部之進攻。已被軸心軍之猛烈反攻及困難之地形所阻。故戰事乃軸入巴勒摩東部沿岸地區，現似正於此地區展開激戰，英國廣播協會前終特派員塔內特，曾稱述西西里島之美軍及加拿大軍，現已遭遇軸心軍强力之反攻，其對於巴勒摩北部地區美軍之反攻抵抗，愈爲頑强。又西西里島之東部戰錢，聞英第八軍於遠距喀太尼亞市之西南部，與軸一心軍繼續展開激戰，同時德軍爲增强兵力，似正由墨西拿海峽，陸續運輸兵員及軍需，英報特派員曾謂，德軍目下正使用多數特大型之遝輸機，增援兵力，故西西島攻防戰，將漸入決戰之階段云。</p>
<p>柏林二十八日中央社電　柏林軍事方面宣稱，西西里美軍總司令巴頓將軍，因在西四里之多山地區及該島內地，無從發展其機械化隊伍，已增加生力軍作戰，顯欲盡力以解放巴勒摩至墨西拿一帶之沿海岸公路，巴頓將軍此項努力之另一原因，爲蒙高茂萊將軍之部隊，未能在喀大尼亞平原之北面邊沿，攻破德義軍之陣終。反軸心軍屢决經由色夫拉向東攻擊，皆被擊潰。德方之快捷轟炸機，亦協助作戰，在沿海岸公路之兩旁，擊毀美軍坦克車及裝甲車無算。德義軍部隊駐守里昂福特以東之有利山嶺陣地，曾數度擊退來攻之反軸心軍，使英美軍指揮部，無從將其戰綫夥前，在四西里德軍陣綫之左翼，業高茂萊將軍所部，未能自喀太尼亞平原，進入德義軍僞飾完善之陣地，現已完全按兵不動。德方之高射砲隊，對於過去數日間之勝利，貢獻頗多，在上星期中，曾擊落反軸心飛機四十六架。載有軍隊之巨型帆船四艘，亦被擊毀。高射砲曾擊毀坦克車十一輛，裝甲偵察軍三輛，摩托化大砲三等，德方高射砲隊，擊毀運載車甚多，使防禦陣綫方面，大爲緩和。德高射砲隊，對英美之登陸艦隊作戰時，曾擊毀摩托魚雷船兩艘，三等砲艦一艘。登陸船數艘，此外另有驅逐艦—艘着火，英國巡洋船三艘，受重創。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾促勿輕視　德龐大實力　空防亦在繼續增强中</h3>
<p>里斯本二十入日中央社電　據倫敦消息：英首相邱吉爾，昨日在下議院　告稱，德國之國力，殊爲可長，故反軸心國之任務，更爲重大。邱氏警告，切勿忽視反軸心國對德作戰之未來巨大任務。渠稱，將來尙須忍受並克服嚴重之困苦憂患，德國之國力，仍甚龐大，但仍完整無缺，希特勒所統率者，尙有德軍三百餘師團，此外尙有其盟國之軍隊，此項德軍有四分之三係可動員的，其中大多數係配備極爲優良者，吾人此時方在西西里與此項德軍之一部份作戰，彼等方據其宜於防守之陣地奮勇抗戰，德國中央政府之權力，可透達德國各層生活，德國又有十餘　之龐大資源，可資運用，反軸心國在此次戰爭中，不能作有重大之錯誤云。</p>
<h3>列寗格勒區　蘇攻勢遭擊退　庫班橋頭德逐出蘇軍　恢復數日前失去陣地</h3>
<p>柏林廿八日中央社電　德國新聞社束綫隨軍記者哈瑪上校稱，星期一日，束錢奧勒爾區之保衛戰，仍在繼續進行中，劇烈之情形不减。同時蘇軍在米烏斯地區與庫班橋頭之戰爭，前數日雖略　鬆懈，而今則蘇軍又加緊進攻。列寗格勒前綫包圍區之東部，亦受蘇軍嚴重之壓力。蘇軍除大砲，坦克軍與其他重武器外，並使用大批眾用飛機，企圖擊破德軍之抵抗，但蘇軍在任何一處均未能佔勝，反受人力與物質之重大損失。星期一日蘇軍共損失坦克車二百二十八輛，其中二百十九輛爲高射砲與平射砲所擊毀，其餘九輛則與德空軍之坦克車炸裂機所毀。此等坦克車，大半化奧勒爾區被擊毀。沿奧勒爾區北部前綫之南側，蘇軍司令部於星期一日抽調並犧牲大批步兵與坦克車，再度試行突破。蘇軍精强之步兵隊，在坦克車前後數批掩護之下，向德軍陣地猛攻，但進攻之蘇軍，大半在德軍陣綫前崩潰，問有少數穿入德軍陣地者，亦爲德軍先頭部隊之側面反攻，或後備兵之局部包圍所殲滅。蘇軍攻勢活動之第二焦點，仍在列寗格勒區，該區拉多加湖以南之德軍陣綫，整日遭受新近獲得步兵與坦克車隊增援之敵軍集中之攻擊，蘇軍並利用軍用飛機爲其步兵聯隊開道，但此處蘇軍之襲擊，亦在德軍防禦砲火之前，宣告崩潰。蘇軍張大之作戰隊一隊，在特重型坦克車掩護之下、破入德軍陣綫，但經德守軍立即發動反攻後，蘇軍完全被殲滅。庫班橋頭德羅軍輕裝兵發動强有力之反攻，將蘇軍由諾伏洛西斯克區之重要高地逐出，該處於數日前失去，而今則抵逢沿全棧之德羅軍舊陣地，森林中展開激戰，勝負之分，一部份取決於肉搏戰，蘇軍死傷與被俘者甚衆，損失重大。蘇軍部兵與坦克車隊向庫班橋頭東部發動集中之攻擊，結果蘇軍損失坦克車十五輛與步兵二聯隊，德軍陣綫前蘇軍戰死者四千人以上，被俘者八百六十人，蘇軍米烏斯區之攻擊亦崩潰。此處德軍防禦之成功，大半當歸功於空軍。德轟炸機俯衝轟炸機與軍用機，猛攻敵軍　開處與駐宿地，予敵以重大之損失。在前綫本處喝德空軍與羅馬尼亞轟炸機，襲擊蘇軍砲隊數處，使其寂然無聲。晚間德轟炸機炸毀蘇軍後方之火車站數處，起火焚燒，路軌數處被炸毀。唐納資中部與貝爾哥洛特區，星期一日僅有局部之戰事，蘇軍因在該二區遭受重大之損失，故不得不整理其部隊。</p>

<p>束條首相於八時四十五分蒞臨第四委員會傍聽，對該委員會討論衣·食·住·配給·健民·文化諸問應爲注意。最後起立致詞稱：</p>
<p>『諸君對於決戰生活的意見，我以爲均非常重要，足爲今後食糧配給問題上的參考。然而一切事情總有所缺陷，政府和人民都應該負起這責任來補救。說日糧食不足者，那是可笑的。近有從德國經蘇聯滿洲而返日的人說，從蘇聯進滿洲時，以爲這是天國，從滿洲返日本時，則又以爲這是極樂世界。諸君担心次一代的國民而關心姙婦幼兒的食糧問題，其實不僅食糧問題爲然，對於一切問題，政府均在盡其最大力量以求解決，使我們一億人民無生活之憂。大東亞戰爭的目的，不僅爲了日本，另有更重大的責任，使大東亞各國民族各得其所，我們日方人必須負起　個責任云。』全會塲對首相的演詞極爲感動。</p>

<p>企業整備眞相</p>
<p>次由岸商相說明企業整備的眞相，各種工業部門的整備情形，爲維持戰時下最低限度的國民生活，極力確保國民生活上必要物資的生產，並使配給順利圓滑。最後希望國民生活應更進一步的徹底簡素化。岸田商相詞畢，暫告休息。</p>

<p>實踐決戰生活</p>
<p>再次由第四委員會船田委員長報告關於實踐決戰生活諸議案，並由安藤內相力說決戰生活的重要，中有一段最値得注意。內相稱：『決戰生活的實踐爲增强戰力的根柢，完遂戰爭的基礎，鑒於現階段的戰局，我們國民應貫澈日水原有的武士道精神，確立簡素而剛健質實的戰爭生活。國民的一部因戰爭意識的不徹底，致對食糧及其他物資不斷的有不正行爲之跡，不勝遺憾。政府爲謀確保國民生活，而積極從事增產食糧，適當配給生物必需物資，故對於違反統制經濟者，斷然實施各種取締措置。因此務望諸位國民刷新衣食住生活，節的消費，增强貯蓄，向決戰生活的實踐邁進云。』小泉厚生相則報告建民運動的最近槪况，習屋藏相則要求國民勵行勤勞，節的，貯蓄，以保存而增加國家的元氣。至此，議程遂告終了。</p>
<p>朗誦必勝誓文</p>
<p>此時，別室起草的「必勝誓文」亦已起草完竣，小林議長於全塲肅立中期誦通過，即由議長宣告會議告終。午後五時　，舉行閉幕式，全體議員及職員至二重橋前奉拜宮城，重返會塲，唱國歌，祈禱畢，即由東條總裁致閉會辭，於六時三十分閉會。散會後議員同應總裁的招宴。（翼）</p>

<p>這樣完善和優美的孤兒院，也不免受到物價浪潮的影響，使孤兒，工友和管理者的生活，陷於極大的困境，孤兒們每日一飯二粥，吃的是戶口米，過去每月向華法兩方各領十五包，計三十六石（工人米貼亦在內），每石繳費二百五十元以上，但近來時常領不到，糧管局方面只供四分之一，因此食糧恐慌日趨嚴重，早晚吃麩皮湯，菜肴自然談不到了。技術工人在院的卅八名，外居的七十五名，供膳食外，每月工資一百至一百廿元，貼米二斗，右妻室者加一斗，有子女滿七歲者每名再加一斗，不滿七歲者半斗，另供宿舍，這一筆開支巳經不小。爲着吃飯難，巳從二百七十六名孤兒中選出三十五名就食於泗涇，另選卅五名寄居於余山，但一切經　仍由該院負担。至於衣被，大都爲舊存者，現多破爛，無力添種，秋冬即屆，合人焦急，實際工作者自負責人呂神父以下，計有神父七名，相公十一名，教員五名，職員卞名，完全以教養孤兒爲其終身事業，犧牲服務，不宴用一分一角，可是，怎能挽救經濟的危機呢？在從前，該院經費來源，一爲國外捐助，二爲上海天全教會誧助，三爲該院工塲出品暢銷南洋非洲所得，現在這三大財源已被截斷了，而他們的開支却隨物價而飛漲增加。據最低估計，每一孤兒一年間之膳費即須一千元以上，三自人即須欽三十萬元，而燃料，水電，衣被，書籍，醫藥，教薪，工資等，其總數也可驚人，每月支在，就要超過五萬元。本年春間，曾向上海市資病救濟協會請求補助，經該會委員紀振綱姚惠泉二先生前往調查後，先有一次補助二萬五千元，六月間繼續補助一萬五千元。使該院稍得透一口氣。然而現在物價飛漲，該院仍陷於極大恐慌之中，記者眼看孤兒們的面黃釩瘦衣衫被爛，與其精美燦爛的工作極不相稱，推想其前途，不禁心酸淚落。該院各部工塲，原爲上海的工業先進，曾參加國內外各種展覽會，所獲獎章達十九件，現有技工學徒的技藝多達爐火純靑地步，如能有經費添辦原料，補充機件，推廣銷路，則前途之發展，希望無限。所以今日尤盼各界慈善及有識人士，或慷慨捐助，或購買該院各種出品，或向親友介紹，協力援助，使數百孤兒教養成功，使該院的事業能維持與發展，這樣歷史悠久成績卓越的上海第個孤兒院，這樣一個實行半工半讀爲社會國家培養人才的慈善機關，我們決不能任其袞落。（完）</p>
<h3>最後一批軍管理工廠　昨舉行發還體</h3>
<p>友邦日本當局爲實踐中日條約建設東亞共榮圈起見，將事變後由日軍管理之華中一帶一百四十家工廠，自民國廿九年十月三十一日起分批絡續交還我國管理，茲以上海兩租界即將於本週末由我國政府收囘，爲協力完成我國實業總力發展計，特將尙餘有管理之十家工廠全部交還，於昨（二十八）日下午三時舉行第十三次交還日軍工廠典禮，是時計到有日軍管理工廠主任委員福山中佐，日大使館事務所森調查官，國民政府代表實業部次長責愈佺，實業部駐滬辦事處處長章駿，專員范光武，科長唐茂熙，及各該工廠日方受託者，華方正常權利者，四十餘人，行禮如儀後，即履行交還工廠雙方調印手續，首由福山主任委員及實業部袁次長相繼致辭，闡明此最後一次交遼之工廠之意義，旋由日方管理工廠受托者代表報告管理工廠經營經過情形，末由大生紡織廠常務董事陳深致答謝詞最後共舉香檳交歡，直至五時許禮成而散。</p>
<p>福山主任委員致詞</p>
<p>福山主任委員致詞略謂，今天交還十工廠，均係江北及崇明地區重要工業，務須效習淸末實業家張　先生之數十年來經管工廠業之精神，蘇北地區十工廠由受託者經營之事業，迄今止盈利一千四百餘萬元，弁辦理公共事業如交通水利病院學校者，均有偉大之功績，今一般中國實業界都巳知道日本對中國之眞意，希各該工廠認識責任，努力推進工業，共圖大束亞建設之完成也。</p>
<p>實業部袁次長致詞</p>
<p>今天舉行策十三次發還軍管理工廠儀式，發還的工廠一共十家，都是南通崇明一帶的工廠，講到南通等地方，在中國工業史上本來佔有很重要的地位，工業非常發達，並且發達得很早，基礎也打得很穩固，中國工業的中心，除了上海和無錫等幾個地方以外，就要輪到南通一帶，經過這一次事變，要是沒有友邦方面陸海軍當局的愛護，恐怕這個工業中心，一定要摧毀無遺，但是現在依舊好好的發還給正當權利者，這應當怎樣盛謝友邦海陸軍當局的善意，爲中國實業前途造福。</p>
<p>現在日本軍事當局和國民政府實業部兩方面，已經完成了一件重大的使命，本人謹代表國民政府對友邦表示深切之謝意，同時希望江北實業界領袖，一本已往張季直先生之精神，對於大東亞戰爭有所貢獻，軍管理工塲整理委員會各位辦事人員在巳往四年間，費了不少心血，完成這重大使命，本人代表國民政府實業部寄以無限之謝意。</p>

<h3>廣肇公所沿革</h3>
<p>— 溫宗堯</p>
<p>查上海廣肇公所，成立於前淸同治十一年，自是年起，至宣統末年止，所有事務，均由董事處理。鄙人加入董事之列，是在宣統二年，其時公所所辦之義務學校，祇有男學生二百人，女子義務學校尙未成立，男學生至民國初年增至三百名，而報名以待收錢者，有千餘名之多。其時</p>
<p>五福星</p>
<p>之房屋，盡爲廣肇兩屬之字號幫，而每年租金祇有八千兩，除去修理費及地捐之外，實得六千兩左右，熱心公益之兩屬同鄕，屢欲加增租金，以推廣學額，但均遭反對。民國六年，鄙人提議加租，不畏强禦，堅持到底，不願加者，須立即遷出，是時董事共三十一名，與鄙人同意者，祇有三名胡耀廷黃伯平譚海秋是也：中立者二名，伍庭芳唐紹儀是也。其餘之二十七名，均極端反對，於是大起風潮，反對者盡行遷出五福里。鄙人乃將五福里之房屋租與外幫，每年租金由八千兩增到二萬兩以上，遂將男學額由三百名增至一千二百名，同時亦設立女子義務學校，而評議員之制度亦開始成立。鄙人乃命文案徐峙崧會同司賬員李用行草擬章程。交董事會討論，而反對者居多數，遂不成立，而至今仍懸爲草案。又過十年，報名以待取錄之學生，又增至千餘名，適是時上海銀行欲公所拆去水身房屋及五福里房屋，將該地全塊租賃，以建築洋式大厦，以爲銀行之用，肯出租金每年八萬兩，又遭廣東俱樂部之反對，因是時公所之樓面是租與該俱樂部，每月租金祇七十五元，該俱樂部要求上海銀行新大厦落成之後，須由公所代之向上海銀行租賃整個樓面一層，而租金不能超過七十五元，此乃不可能之事，是以遭其極端反對，至於涉訟，但鄙人堅持到底，租的卒之成立，而男學額遂由每年一千二百名，增至二千五百名，而女校學額亦增至五百餘名。查公所之仰統習慣，對於月有收入之產業，不肯變賣，但可將月無收入及無用之產業變賣，以興辦有益之事業，此有先例可憑也。光緒三十二年十二月初六日，曾將新閘路之</p>
<p>舊山莊</p>
<p>七十一畝一分七釐八毫，賣與廣肇產業公司，此事載於公所每年徵信錄，一查便知，本公所現將車袋角之舊山莊出賣，是援此先例也，車袋角之舊山莊，經當局催促搬遷，限期巳過矣，該山莊之地是一百十六畝，今賣與同益地產公司，得款一千零四十萬元，在大塲之新山莊，最低限度須添買一百十六畝，以補足所賣出之畝數。查大塲之新山莊，現在未葬之地，只有一百七十三穴而已，若不立刻添買新地，則兩府同鄕之先友，無地安葬，苟不賣去車袋角之無出息山莊，則無款添買新地於新山莊。又廣綮男校女校及醫院均爲友邦人士所佔用，尙未交還，若不賣出車袋角無收入之山莊，則無款購置男女校址，不能建築校舍，而教育不能進　，對於貧苦同鄕不能贈施醫藥，從來公所辦事，祇依照習慣而行，雖極閑窮需款孔亟，亦不肯變賣有收人之產業，祗可司人暫募公債而已。民國十三年車袋角之舊山莊葬地告滿，須在大塲購置新山莊，需款數十萬元，是用　公債之辦法，以　足甚數，此事亦詳載於微信錄。茲値出售車袋角舊山莊用以興辦各項公益事業之時，爰將公所沿革慨述於上。</p>
<h3>新聞聯會慶祝交還租界　演講大會圓滿閉幕　林康侯昨主講安居樂業</h3>
<p>上海新聞聯合會，爲慶祝國府定期實施收同本市兩租界主辦之收囘租界演講大會，昨（廿八日）爲大會之第三日，即最後一天，下午八時，仍繼續在雨京大戲院舉行，邀請吾國經濟界權威林康侯氏主講，本市各界民衆，前往聽講者，更異常擁擠，座爲之滿。准時開會，主席團尾坂與市（日高淸麼瑳代）。金雄白（陸光杰代）兩氏，舉行儀式後，由王席團金雄白代表陸光杰致開會辭。繼由林氏演講，頗爲詳切。講畢即放映中聯出品反英美巨片「賣花女」，至十一時散會，上海新聞聯合會舉辦之盛大演講會，於此乃告圓滿結束。</p>
<p>林氏主講安居樂業</p>
<p>林氏講詞，大意略謂：今日承諸君熱烈參加上　新聞聯合會慶祝收囘租界演講大會，深爲欣快，此次之租界教囘，承友邦日水之協助，完成吾國之心願。於今妝囘租界之日快臨，余有二句話聲述，即「一則以喜，一則以懼」，喜者乃我國百年來受英美之束縛，一旦獲得解放，爲歡忻愉快之事。惟在快樂之餘，我人不得不顧慮前途，如何發展大上海之建設，及努力建股新的中國。我人之責任，當謀安居樂業，而爲全市民衆莫不希望者，如何使之安居本市自前年十二月八日之後，承友邦之協助，由减少罪案，而漸致絕跡，故人民之安居，當爲除暴安良。過去租界，因受外人勢力庇護，大家均視爲安樂之窩，一遇地方戰亂，市民無不紛紛遷避租界，養成苟安心理。現在租界快將交還，也許有人以爲安樂高，將失其庇護作用，担憂着未來的安居問題。其實此種心理，全是苟安中孕育出來的，故今後要求眞正的安居，絕不能再存依賴苟安心理。除期望政府外，亟盼市民自身做到的，（一）對於一切事物應有積極的責任，力求撙節糜費。（二）不以小我而唯求私利，應顧全大衆公益爲重。（三）目前推行之保甲制度，於安居樂業大有效用，應竭力加强，使其效用益彰云云。</p>

<h3>昨日聯誼足球隊　三度勝聖葡　比數爲四對三</h3>
<p>華通盃足球義賽最後一幕，聯誼三戰聖葡，於昨日下午六時在徐匯中學球塲交鋒，昨日聖葡將士，在嚴密計劃戰策後，三軍用命，故聲勢甚爲洶湧，而聯誼將士，均沉着應戰，全軍奮發，究因球　究高一籌，結果以四比三相差一球之先。再度凱歌高奏，全塲觀衆，英不爲聯誼歡呼慶祝。正戲登塲之前，並由中華對華影挿曲，結果雙方一比一握手言和。</p>
<p>聯誼戰聖葡裁判張樂笛聲高起，聖葡即行進攻A柯拉沙妙頂遞交福恩，福恩正待衝前力射，顯漢眼快手快，銜前救出後，聯誼即刻反攻，惜均交臂失措，十分鐘時，義臣得後方供應，轉交祺祥，吳徧過許爾茲即送與老孫，孫老錦衝前力叩，一比〇紀錄遂開。此後聖葡　　反攻，均因聯誼後方墊固，終未得逞，而聯誼又於廿三分鐘時，高保正得老孫來球，又建奇功二比〇聯誼遙領，直至將近上半時終塲時，聯誼宋靈聖禁區犯手球，維克泰立罰十二碼告成，旣而卡洛列區一掃又告鵠中，二比二秋色平分，再戰聲中，　春華痛飲黃龍，三比二聯誼又告領先，而此後聖葡卡洛例區一掃中的，雙方又成平局。但聯誼賴最後努力，費春華於終塲前二分鐘得義臣供應，攻入一球，遂以四比三之結局而奏凱。</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>穩定物價步驟</h3>
<p>工部局物資統制委員會發言人，昨論穩定物價步驟，歸納於兩個要點，就是（甲）增加可以獲得之主要物資供給或增加生產，（乙）减少需求或消耗量，換一句話說，就是開源與節流。</p>
<p>我們從前說過，「開源節流」是自古以來的中國經濟原則；在今日的統制經濟中，更不能不奉爲準繩，鼓勵生產，收買物資都是開源節的消費，限制放款，都是節流。開源與節流的步驟，旣經決定，則最爲迫切的問題，即爲步驟的如何可以達到。</p>
<p>法律上的適當措置，即爲達到這些步驟的階石，因此，我們渴望租界收囘以後，法律上的措置，來得此較適當一些，那末，經濟上的措置，也許可以得到較爲迅速的效果。</p>
<h3>各業評委會　積極進行調查工作</h3>
<p>邇來百物售價步步高昂，究其原因，奸商之掀風作浪實爲主因之一，關於囤積投機關係當局現正作進一步之澈查，惟各業公會爲協助當局取締投機囤積起見，力勸會員商店厲行自肅，庶穩定物價，確保民生，各業公會除懇切忠告其會員外，尙積極進行調查工作，負有是項使命者，即爲各業評價委爲評訂百物售價，同時尚有負檢舉懲處違法商店之　，日來各業評價委員會特派大批調查員分赴界內各商店門市部嚴密調查，對於違法商店，決予嚴罰。</p>
<p>訂定各種　樂規則</p>
<p>各業評價委員會特訂定各種營業規則，飭各商店恪守勿渝，茲錄規則之要點如下：（一）本會訂定之各級物品限價，同業會員必須遵守，照限價出售，不得陽奉陰違，及暗中越價出售。（二）不得經營黑市交易，及有買空賣空之非法舉動。（三）每月（或每旬）務須塡具報告表正副兩份，送交木會備查。（四）各種貨物以售給正當用戶爲限，不得轉售販商或業外商人牢利。（五）門市出售任何物品，應標定本會　定之限價，共字體之大小及標籤之式樣，以當局規定者爲限，並須放置顯明處所，務使每一顧主易於望見及辨別淸楚。（六）所用度量衡器，須適合標準，嚴禁僞造或長或短，或方或小。（七）買賣各種貨物大必須入册，以備將來當局及本會調查人員隨時索閱，在調查人員索閱時，應迅將帳册出示，不得有他種藉口。（八）將配得之貨物不得　藏拒售，以免淆惑人心。（九）嚴禁偷質减量，冀獲意外利潤。（十）倘有違反上述各款之一者，即予依法懲處或起訢法院不稍寬貸。</p>

<p>當局擬定運營方針</p>
<p>當局此次允許證券市塲復業，原以循正當途徑，利用民族資金，發展企業爲依歸。故已確定方針，飭證券交易所採納爲復業後運管之對策。（一）股票流通激使合法公開，消滅黑市，使遊資納入正當途徑，發展企業擴充生產。（二）不合法公司之股票不得上市，買賣限於現貨，價格宜有適當之調整。（三）華股交易絕對禁止投機操縱。</p>

<p>在對外戰爭時期之國家經濟策略，無不講求精密統制，以調整超越常態的物資供求新關係，藉謀國家需要之不缺乏，人民生活之無恐慌，外則以增强戰鬥力量，內則以安定民心鞏固國本，此乃統制之最高目的。故無論間接或直接可以影響上述目的之經濟事項者，悉納入統制之範圍而加以管理。故戰時經濟政策綱領中最有關係的兩點，即爲「增加生產」，與「節約消費」</p>
<p>以言以上兩項推行之初，屬於前者，吾國農工鑛業機器的基礎幼稚，根本之圖，則有賴於重工業之建立，以爲前導。然急切之間，殊難達理想境地。至於後者，則爲已力範園以內之事，僅視諸木身之努力程度而定，比較上實爲輕而易舉之事。</p>
<p>當茲物資需用正殷之時，在原則上，政府對於有用物品，即使國內產量尙豐，一時無處缺乏，亦宜加以愛惜，不使民間無謂浪費。惟人民習俗相染，雖欲履行節的，而無準則可資遵守，以至浪費與節的之界限不淸，僅視個人之經濟能力爲中心，散漫無序，是以應請政府出而支持，制定簡單易行方案，首先制止浪費性質之製造，以節原料之消耗，次及於消費者之管理，使生活簡化，而以「言出法隨」之精神，强制執行之。譬如：禁止一切化妝用品之製造，移原料以製皂燭；禁止一切有花布疋綢緞之織造，而規定易於產製之純色種類；統工廠出品，倡導人民服用標準服色；諸如此類，則可以减少無謂之消耗，而必需物品之產量，復可因而增加。</p>
<p>以言政府強制執行之方案，人民無分貧富，，均須有嚴格服從之義務，而不能有所逾越。而決策之先，必須由專家愼密考量，凡人民生活必需物品，質量雙方，必須推究合理之標準數量，平價給予，悉以衣·食·住·行·衛生·教育等等爲享受之範國，並須充分維持範圍以內之福利事業。自配給物品方面言，必須盡量縮减人民領受時間，處處務求合理化。一面消除一切靡費奢華，以及無益於身心之事項，如烟賭等等，庶平民得以安於所業，即富有之家，亦因消費之途减少，利心韓淡，社會風氣，賴以淳樸，一舉而數善兼，則强制執行之節的，實爲保障人民生活安定之要圖。</p>

<h3>從助「學」運動　談到助「校」運動</h3>
<p>— 陳紹</p>
<p>助學運動之目的至爲簡明，一曰普及教育，二曰培養人才。但此兩項目的之性質逈異，不能相持並論，故所取之途徑亦各自不同。請分論於後：</p>
<p>（一）普及教育　任何集體之組織，必含有基層中層上層三級。基層最爲廣泛，中層次之，上層又次之，理所當然。惟各級須具備其本位之條件，然後整個集體方能健全。就國家而言，一般國民乃其基層，應各具日常生活之常識，並明瞭其本身之天職，負此項訓練者，乃小學教育機關，故小學教育務求普及而不聞中學或大學教育之求普及者，其原因在此，遇淸寒子弟之無力入小學者，當盡量資助，以完成其最低限度之訓練，爲國家有力之基層，然未足以言培養人才。</p>
<p>（二）培養人才　人才復可分爲二類：一曰佐治人才，須具備其本位之常識，以及推行政策實施計劃之能力。負此項訓練之責者，乃普通中學或職業教育機關。二曰領袖人才，須具其本位之高深智能，認識國情，洞悉時局，而能策劃綱領統率僚屬邁步前進以達其理想之境。負此項訓練之　者，乃專科以上之大學教育機關。是以一般優秀分子不應止於小學，亦惟天賦獨厚者，方能入大學而有所造就，此就人選方面而言。至於教師之表率，器材之精良，在小學固未嘗不感重要，若言培養人才，則中學大學之師資與設備，乃此兩級教育實實之所在。自來中國教育之缺陷在此，中國敎育之失敗亦在此，而今更每况愈下。故中學畢業生每無佐治能力，而大學畢業生更難有領袖之才幹。蓋在小學六年，縱不能養成理想之國民，斷不致目不識丁，亦且尙知謙遜有禮。迨中學畢業國文且不能淸通者，比比皆是，又復傲慢凌人肆無忌憚。大學畢業生中果能獨立研究專門題者，尤不多覯。加以神情恍忽意志頹唐，其何以任重而致遠。於是可見進中學大學肄業是一件事，而培養人才是另一件事。</p>
<p>普及教育以量爲主，培養人才以　爲　。　曰人才缺乏，但非粗製　造所可挽救。就學生方面言之，務必考核嚴格寗闕毋濫。就學校方面言之，務必師資超絕設備完全。今也各級教師不僅　腹從公，抑且坐而待斃，而一切國書儀器由因陋就簡而至殘缺不全、在目前戰爭狀態之下，固不易言盡美盡善，然平心而論未盡人事之處正復不少。其以學校爲商店惟利是圖之流，本是教育界之蟊賊，姑不在此誅論。縱有有心人士志在樂育人才者，亦徒以經濟竭蹶而一籌莫展。學費定額雖倍　於往昔、然較物價之狂漲，依然膛乎其後。於是教師之生活愈不堪問，而設備上之窳敗亦日甚一日，終至教學之效率，不僅等於零而得相反之結果。蓋具形式而無內容之中學大學，適足以產生浮躁驕矜之靑年，高不成低不就，人才云乎哉。故目前助「學」運動之方式，施之於小學、充其量足以使國民教育普及，而去培養人才之標的，則尙遠甚。然則如之可而可、曰創導助「校」運動。</p>
<p>教育事業原當由政府負完全責任、整理推進使無遺憾，但在非常時期，人民國當協助政府力之所不遠者，以助「學」之精神擴而尺之，亦未嘗不可以助「校」，所有機構與辦法初無二致，其不同者，僅對象之變更，而所需之款項較鉅。茲就管見所及，略舉實施助「校」運動之綱要於後，以供熱心人士同情於此者之參考，一事之愈艱鉅者，愈須集中全力以赴之，故應由公正廉明之士組織一助校運動之中樞，担任徵募保管甄別分配考核等重人責任。二在徵募款項之時，同時甄選現有中學大學中之最値得資助者。以期進行迅速早　成效。財力雄厚則多助，財力薄弱則少助亦屬無妨。能於推行助校運動後短時間內，產生合理之中學大學各一，則已足以樹風聲而勸來茲。三、助校之道有二：（甲）資助　備選擇現有學校中缺陷最少者，先行補充，務使教學上一切器材雖不能應有盡有，亦須在目前環境所許可之範圍內、達到其應有之水準。（乙）資助教師。選擇教師中之堪稱師表者，資助其生活，務使其對於仰事俯蓄不復有所憂顧、竭其全力服務於教育。兼職過多者改爲專任，棄敢他就者挽其復職。　辦理妥善無　無頗，則獲助之校與獲助之帥，皆足引爲無上之榮譽，於是校風　而師道尊，其影響之所及，又豈僅限於一校一師而已哉。四，獲助之校旣不賴學費維持，則收取學生務求審愼畢業學生務求嚴格，庶不致廢費有限之財力而遭失敗。學生之得肄業或畢業於獲助之學校，以及從遊於獲助教師之門者，亦必引爲無上光榮。於是竊盜虛聲濫竽充數之弊可革。五，獲助之校設備旣充，於教學之餘遂可兼營生產之業，使學者更親切於實　，同時以其盈餘更求充實或移助他校，則收效益宏。六，獲助之師除課徒以外，應利用餘晷從事著述，不特對於文化界有所供獻，且可以其稿費版稅移助他師，而倡切磋互助之風。</p>
<p>滬上遊資充斥，鼓動激盪，適足以危害民生傾覆社稷。希望富商大買，放棄暴利之逐鹿，而從事於百年大計，尤其在萬方多難之日爲將來作綢繆之計。眼見教育普及人才輩出，較之金迷紙醉求耽樂於一時，其所得之安慰爲何如。謹向各界呼籲，擴大助「學」運動爲助「校」運動！</p>

<h3>貢獻於商統會及其下層機構</h3>
<p>— 楊立人</p>
<p>全國商業統制總會，成立以來，已有四月，其下層機構如各業同業聯合會，及各同業公會，均已先後成立；對於實施新經濟政策，在政府領導之下，自必有一番新的發展。人民在此生活程度繼漲增高聲中，無日不渴望各該機構，盡其最大之勢力，使此案亂不堪之市面，趨於安定，而稍稍有裨於國計民生。惟數月以來，物價一再暴漲，較之二三月以前，不啻倍蓰，此其故雖在奸商之操縱壟斷，但各該機構之未能盡量發揮其能力，恐亦爲一大原因。爲今之計，下列諸端，希望各該機構，迅即設法解決。</p>
<p>一，設立物資評價委員會　各同業聯合會，應即成立物資評價委員會，就製造商製造成本，在最短期內，規定最標準最合現之價格，經商統會核准以後施行，各會員絕對不得變更。</p>
<p>一，商品登記　各商號所有貨品，應在每月月底、向同業公會同業聯合會及商統會登記。各聯合會將各該商號登記表副本，蓋章發還原商號、縣掛在顯明塲所，如巳出售，應即註明，顧客有懷疑時，並可查詢其發票，以免店夥誑稱無貨。</p>
<p>一，取締掮客買賣近年以來，任何商品，均有大批掮客從中上下其手，操縱市面，各種物價之高漲，此亦一大原因，嗣後應連絡警務人員，絕對取締，凡非同業公會會員，一槪不准買賣。</p>
<p>一，設立統制經濟硏究會統制經濟，在過去絕少硏究，經辦人員，頗有無所適從之感、筆者以爲應由商統會主持設一統制經濟硏究會，聘請富有學識之國內外學者，利用工作餘暇，定期作有系統之演講，一面施行精神訓練，務使唐壽民先生所揭示之公正廉明四字，深印於每一服務者之心中，先訓練商統會及聯合會職員，再訓練同業公會職員俾成爲有訓練有組織之幹部人材。</p>
<h3>讀「政治的是非與民意上達」書後</h3>
<p>— 楊萬里</p>
<p>我讀了陳孚木先生這篇論文之後，（見申報七月十八日星期評論）不禁百感交集。難道政府眞的不要民心麼？不，不獨不要民心，而且竟不要老百姓了。你看如果要老百姓，何以生活程度這樣的天天高漲，尤其是「米」，漲得很是利害。</p>
<p>任何一個國家，欲求强盛，第一在得民心，所謂「民之好者好之，民之惡者惡之」。古今歷史上沒有一個國家不得民心而能强盛的。然而政府對於民心的向背，是否有動乎中？生活程度這樣的天天高漲，政府雖有皇皇的通令，對於查獲圃積貨物的奸人，處以國法，但是「只聽樓梯響、不見人下來</p>
<p>政府欲得民心，是這不難的事：第一，政治切不可說謊，凡政府所出的命令，不出則巳，出則不論任何困雖，必須使其兌現。空頭支票、一而再，再而三，何能使受者相信呢？第二，須將物價，尤其是米，從速使其平下，否則「千夫所指」，前途眞不堪設想？這兩個問題，政府如果欲得民心，必須將牠立刻解決。解決之後，民心自然而然的歸順了。</p>
<p>我愛中國，我愛東亞，我亦愛日本，爲了求大東亞戰爭的最後勝利，必須取得民心。希望政府坐而言，不如立而行，將老百姓的生活問題，立刻予以解決，我更希望友邦日本當局，立刻協助我們政府，解決老百姓最重要的生活問題。</p>

        <h1>1943.07.29</h1>
<h3>Our Mirror</h3>
<p>The Japan Imperial Rule Assistance Association, with the two major goals of completing the decisive battle production and practicing the decisive battle life, held its fourth central cooperation conference, bringing together local civilian representatives to discuss various practical issues. At the same time, government officials attended to explain the government's intentions and promotion policies, and immediately expressed respect and acceptance of the suggestions decided by the conference. Although half a month has passed since the end of the conference, due to the brief news reports at the time, the full picture was not seen. Recently, excerpts from the Japanese Mainichi Shimbun were translated and published regarding the conference proposals (published in this newspaper from the 27th to the 29th) to show a glimpse of the situation.</p>
<p>What is meant by completing decisive battle production? It is a kind of power necessary to win the decisive battle. This kind of power is obtained from the production aspect, so it must be completed. What is meant by practicing decisive battle life? It is another kind of power necessary to win the decisive battle. This other kind of power is contained in the lives of all citizens, so it must be practiced. It can also be said that the former is material resources, and the latter is human resources, which are the two major elements for winning the war. Our friendly nation Japan regards the victory of the Greater East Asia War as the key to the liberation of the entire East Asian nation, and does not hesitate to overcome difficulties, with the entire nation united in one mind and marching towards one goal. All things that can enhance combat power, no matter how big or small, are studied and practiced with the greatest perseverance. At the same time, attention is paid to the different environmental changes caused by time and space at any time and place, and different countermeasures are immediately taken to adapt to them. Under this approach, any regular and sudden difficulties can be overcome very quickly, and there will never be a situation of being at a loss or having no clue. We are not saying that Japan is perfect in everything. However, we must correctly recognize the facts mentioned above about the Japanese government and people working together and being loyal to the country, especially today when our national affairs are turbulent and the internal and external situation is urgent, and we need to take a frank attitude, learn from others' strengths, and make up for our weaknesses.</p>
<p>We and Japan are already standing on the same front. The completion of decisive battle production and the practice of wartime life that Japan needs is, without a doubt, even more urgent for us, because compared with Japan's current wartime production capacity and wartime national life, the distance between them is too far behind us. Of course, we need to catch up and close the distance. Therefore, we should regard this Japanese Central Cooperation Conference as a mirror, and compare it in detail, and we must reveal all the dirty spots and thoroughly wash and groom them.</p>
<p>The scope of discussion of the proposals at this conference includes cooperation between government and civilians, national mobilization, enterprise consolidation, increased food production, innovative education, and science and technology, which are summarized into the two major goals of completing decisive battle production and practicing decisive battle life. The opinions provided by the representatives are all practical countermeasures aimed at actual difficulties. They do not refrain from mentioning trivial matters, nor do they make lofty and empty discussions. They exchange opinions and argue with each other completely in a heated atmosphere, which is especially worthy of attention.</p>
<p>There are many aspects in the proposals that we can learn from. The main points are listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Concentrating labor to supplement it is unanimously regarded as an urgent task. In order to complete the decisive battle production, regardless of men and women, we should all invigorate the spirit of diligence and labor. It is advocated to set up two types of national industrial reserve teams, one is a reserve team to maintain the number of laborers, and the other is a reserve team to adapt to special skills. In this way, it will not be hindered by any situation, and there will be no phenomenon of lack of laborers and reduced production.</p>
<p>(2) In terms of enterprise consolidation, although the government plans to use some private factories in the heavy industry sector for the production of specific military supplies, there are no appropriate guidelines, nor are standard values set, allowing the organizers and factories to freely calculate the values, resulting in abnormal price increases in property prices, which hinder increased production. Countermeasures for adjustment should be determined urgently. This kind of public criticism from the private sector for the government's lack of guidance, and at the same time, government officials immediately expressed serious consideration, the people's opinions have the opportunity to be expressed, and the government has the sincerity to accept them frankly. This is the key to the government and the people working together to generate a unified force.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the issue of increasing food production and domestic self-sufficiency, all the councilors exchanged opinions from various aspects based on their long-term personal experience and professional knowledge, and taking into account the current situation, and believe that the most direct obstacles to increasing production are the problems of agricultural technology, fertilizers, and labor shortages. The officials of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry also explained the government's handling policies, and then discussed how to use agricultural technology guidance as an urgent task. The fertilizer problem was regarded as the same as the five major important industries in the previous meeting, but the fertilizer movement should also be actively implemented, and the two should complement each other to break the current situation. Regarding the establishment of a special labor mobilization problem during the busy farming season, a food domestic self-sufficiency and increased production committee should be set up in each village and town to adjust the supply and demand relationship of labor, with the village and town chiefs as the chairmen, and be given the power to requisition labor to implement planned allocation. We know that Japan's food production is not enough to meet domestic needs, but it strives to increase production in order to achieve domestic self-sufficiency, and in our rural customs, the fertilizer problem does not seem to be taken seriously, but they regard it as equal to the five major industries based on its factual importance. This spirit of seeking truth from facts is the characteristic of overcoming difficulties. If the supply and demand of labor are not balanced, the village and town chiefs are given the special power of requisition and planned allocation, which is almost the same as the so-called making the best use of people's talents and making the best use of things.</p>
<p>(4) Cooperation between government and civilians and national mobilization are promoted through various educational training methods. Regarding the point of conscription, the government tries its best to avoid it, believing that micro-use is certainly the easiest method in terms of labor, but the impact on the spiritual aspect is extremely significant. It would rather have the people automatically invigorate the spirit of diligence and serving the country. Looking at the Japanese people's consistently enthusiastic patriotic concept, it is enough to inspire the people's spontaneous emotions. Even if the government does not adopt the conscription method, it can also achieve the actual effect of conscription. This is certainly not a coincidence.</p>
<p>We don't need to list more. At the same time, what is suitable for them may not be entirely suitable for us. However, their spirit of cooperation between the government and the people can undoubtedly be fully accepted by us. We hope that our compatriots will strive to emulate the Japanese people's enthusiasm for serving the country loyally. At the same time, we also hope that the government authorities will redouble their efforts and do their best to lead. The victory of the war and the revival of the country depend entirely on this!</p>

<h3>Ambassador Gu Gives a Speech on the Issue of Returning the Shanghai Leased Territories: Japan's New Policy Towards China Will Be Promoted More Actively in the Future; After the Return of the Concessions, the Remaining Anglo-American Thought Must Be Eradicated</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) - Prior to the return of the Shanghai leased territories this time, Japanese Ambassador to China Gu Zhengzhi specially received a group of reporters at his official residence at 5 pm on the 28th and gave a speech. The general idea is that the recovery of the Shanghai leased territories means that the Chinese leased territory issue has been completely resolved. Japan's so-called new policy towards China will be actively and forcefully promoted as part of our country's Greater East Asia policy. The foundation of our country's Greater East Asia policy is to establish the autonomy, independence, and prosperity of all countries, and horizontally to strengthen the powerful unity of all countries. If we still pretend not to see the infinite future of Greater East Asia and want to wait for changes in the world situation, it is no different from the Jews, and it can also be said to be hindering Japan's new policy towards China. After the start of the new policy, there are still many things to be done. There is absolutely no reason to say that it has come to an end or that it has been suspended. The new policy will be like the war, without any rest and without stopping. At the time of recovering the Shanghai concession, the National Government decided to send senior officials to Shanghai to promote the new Shanghai construction work after the recovery of the concession. This matter was personally decided by Chairman Wang in order to ensure the perfection of Shanghai's management and to strive to grasp the promising young people in China, because there are still remnants of Anglo-American thought in Shanghai, so ideologically, it must also be thoroughly eradicated.</p>

<h3>Bihari Bose Gives a Speech</h3>
<p>Zhaonan, 28th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Bihari Bose, the Supreme Advisor of the headquarters of the Indian Independence League, recently traveled from here to Penang Island for recuperation due to his weak health. He is scheduled to travel for one month. Before his departure, he met with a group of reporters and gave a speech, saying that the Indian National Army has reached a considerable level in both quality and quantity, and its modernization of equipment is especially commendable, so its strength is quite strong. The first batch of students from the officers' training school have also graduated, and the performance of the staff training school is also excellent, and the morale of the soldiers is quite strong. I am quite confident that the Indian National Army will not be weaker than the army of any country. As for the women's team, it is currently being organized, and other matters such as the general mobilization of materials are being carried out, and a large-scale movement has been launched. Also, the closer the establishment of the Indian provisional government is to India, the greater its importance will be. When the National Army invades India, the establishment of the government will be even more inevitable. By this time, the general leaders of India will definitely come to join us one after another, and the British will be powerless no matter what. In addition, the reorganization of the alliance has also been largely completed, and a new construction department has been set up to consider the future security, health, food, and transportation issues of India. However, when we will invade India is still a question, because it is related to the world situation and other objective situations, so it is inconvenient to say.</p>
<h3>Thai Authorities Celebrate Army Day</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 28th (Central News Agency) - The Thai Army authorities had previously decided to designate July 28, the anniversary of the Thai-Vietnamese War, as Army Day.

<h3>Japan, Germany, and Italy Will Not Change Their Determination to Carry Out the War; Italian Ambassador to Japan Indri Notifies the Japanese Foreign Minister of This Intention</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - On the afternoon of the 28th, the Italian Embassy in Japan issued a statement on the coup in that country, pointing out that Italy's efforts to jointly carry out the war with Japan and Germany will be strengthened by this coup, which will strengthen the state of unity of the domestic forces. The general idea is that the change of the Italian cabinet will not change Italy's international relations, especially the war aims pursued by Japan, Germany, and Italy. The statement of Italian Prime Minister Marshal Badoglio has also clarified that the war will continue to be waged. The state that Italy is currently experiencing, due to Italy's geographical location away from the center of the European continent, its domestic problems are of course different from the positions of Japan and Germany. Italy's recent coup was entirely for this reason. The purpose of the new cabinet is to further gather the national strength. Italy is currently under attack by the enemy in the land, sea, and air, and a part of Italian territory has been invaded by the US military. On the contrary, Japan and Germany are fighting the enemy in areas far away from their homelands. If you think about this, you can understand Italy's special position. Although Italy has undergone this coup, the excellence of the Italian army has not been diminished in the slightest, and the close cooperation with Germany has not only not been hindered, but will be strengthened in the future. The courageous resistance of the Italian army in Sicily is the best evidence of this. Italy's war is not for Fascism, nor is it to support Germany, but for the sacred rights and future guarantees of the Italian people. The Italian people, without the need for the Badoglio cabinet to launch alert measures, still maintain good order. This proves that the new cabinet has won the support of adults and young people from Fascist backgrounds and the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - The news of the Italian coup was first announced by the Rome Broadcasting Station at 10:55 pm on the 25th. However, the telecommunications connection between Rome and Tokyo was temporarily cut off for a while. It was not until the 28th that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from Japanese Ambassador to Italy Hidaka, stating that the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had personally handed over the statement of the change of the Italian government, the proclamation of the Italian King, and the proclamation of the new Prime Minister Badoglio to the ambassadors of various countries in Italy at 10 pm on the 25th. Marshal Badoglio specially requested a meeting with Ambassador Hidaka, the envoy of the allied country, at 8:30 that evening and explained that he had been appointed Prime Minister by the order of the King. The Italian Ambassador to Japan, Indri, had formally notified Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu on the 27th, stating that Italy's policy of jointly carrying out the war with Japan, Germany, and Italy would not be changed by this coup. Judging from Ambassador Hidaka's telegram, Japan and Italy still maintained close contact in Rome before this Italian coup.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Cai Holds Tea Party to Celebrate the Recovery of the Shanghai Leased Territories</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - My country's Ambassador to Japan, Cai Peishi, because the French Concession and the Public Concession in Shanghai will be returned on July 30th and August 1st, respectively, and the long-cherished wish of my country for decades has been realized, so in order to celebrate, it was specially decided to hold a celebration tea party at the Marunouchi Greater East Asia Hall here at 3 pm on August 1st to entertain Japanese dignitaries from all walks of life.

<h3>New Italian Cabinet Members Sworn In, New Foreign Minister Still in Turkey to Return Home</h3>
<p>Rome, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to the "Piccolo" newspaper, the new Italian cabinet was sworn in today. After the ceremony, each cabinet member immediately took office.</p>
<p>Rome, 28th (Central News Agency) - Italian officials announced on Tuesday the change of the Italian government. It was neither a revolution nor a coup, but merely a constitutional crisis that has been resolved through constitutional means. The head of government has submitted his resignation to His Majesty the King following a vote by the Grand Fascist Council. The change of government was carried out in accordance with the constitution. Based on the motion of the majority of the Fascist Council, the King has taken constitutional measures to assume the supreme command of the national defense and the supreme power of the government. There will be no change in Italy's foreign policy. Italy will keep its promises and continue the war as announced by Marshal Badoglio. Italy's foreign policy will not be affected by this event. Italy will continue to move forward. The Grand Fascist Council is only concerned with internal affairs. The former head of government still enjoys the rights he is entitled to. Law and order have been fully restored in Italian cities and towns, and life has returned to normal.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 28th (Central News Agency) - The former Italian Ambassador to Turkey, Baron Guariglia, the new Foreign Minister of Italy, will depart from Turkey to return to his country as soon as possible.

Public life in the Italian capital has returned to normal. All offices are open as usual, road traffic is unimpeded, and food supplies are distributed as usual. The people are very disciplined and obey the orders of the military authorities.</p>
<p>German Commentary</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Hai Tong News Agency, a German political report stated that Berlin is closely monitoring the events in Italy. Mussolini's resignation and Marshal Badoglio's succession as Prime Minister are very significant political developments, which no one can deny. Of course, this development is also related to German-Italian relations. For many years, Germany and Italy have shared weal and woe, have the same ideology, have the same revolutionary history, and have similar political institutions. In particular, Hitler and Mussolini have a deep friendship. Whether this relationship can remain unaffected by the current political changes in Italy can only be proven by future events. At this stage, what is more important than the personal relationship between the two leaders and the common ideology of the two countries is the common destiny of the two nations to fight for the defense of Europe. It should be noted that the declaration of war by the Anglo-American financial groups and Soviet communism is against the German and Italian nations, not just against the leaders of the two countries or the political organizations of the two countries. In fact, Britain and the United States have spared no effort to imitate the fascist system. The reaction of British and American public opinion to Mussolini's departure is enough to prove that the target of the war waged by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is not the leaders of the two countries, but the nations of the two countries. British and American newspapers are now launching attacks on Italian Prime Minister Badoglio, which is exactly the same as their attacks on Mussolini in the past. This shows that Italy's war today is not to maintain fascism, but for the future of Italy and the Italian nation. Who the leader is is only an internal matter of Italy.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to the Hai Tong News Agency, now that the situation in Italy has become clear, the attitude of the German authorities towards the political situation in Italy has gradually become certain. The reorganization of the Italian government has had a great impact on the German people because the German-Italian alliance is (1) due to the personal friendship between Hitler and Mussolini, and (2) the consensus of the two great revolutionary parties. Since the Bismarck era, Germans who have received political training have understood the common interests between Germany and Italy. The German and Italian people can remember that when Italy sought its survival interests in Abyssinia, it was opposed by the Entente powers. Only Germany supported Italy. The common interest of Germany and Italy is to expand living space, achieve economic self-sufficiency, obtain independent and rational use of the world's resources, and preserve Europe from the influence of foreign forces. All patriotic Italians are unwilling to relinquish the responsibility that Italy should bear to become a modern power. This has been solemnly stated by the Italian King and the new Prime Minister. The change of important personnel in totalitarian countries will never change the important interests of the country.</p>
<p>American Attitude</p>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington dispatch, at yesterday's press conference, President Roosevelt made his first comment on the Italian events. He said that the United States' attitude towards Italy has not changed. When President Roosevelt answered questions about this matter, he said that Secretary of State Hull's statement on Monday regarding the unchanged attitude of the United States government was sufficient to explain the attitude of the United States.</p>
<h3>Japanese Submarine Sinks Enemy Grade A Cruiser</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - The operational scope of Japanese naval submarines has extended to the entire Pacific Ocean, from the Aleutians in the north to Australia in the south, and as far as the American coast in the east. Within this water area, there is no place that is not an operational area for Japanese submarines. They appear and disappear on the ocean surface, ambushing enemy warships and ships everywhere. Their hard work cannot be described in words. Moreover, due to the development of radio detectors and the increase in the range of aircraft patrols, submarines often have to surface even at night to replenish power. Since the enemy's counterattack began, the fierce battle between the Japanese and American forces centered on New Georgia Island has reached its climax. The enemy has even changed to a do-or-die determination and is actively reinforcing. Under this battle situation, Japanese submarines, unafraid of sacrifice, have penetrated deep into enemy territory, searching for enemy traces day and night. Until the afternoon of July 20, the submarine's internal air became extremely turbid due to prolonged underwater navigation. Orders to prepare to purify the air and release enzymes were constantly issued. In this scorching heat, the captain was personally observing through the periscope, so the periscope that surfaced was constantly moving. Suddenly, an alarm bell rang inside the submarine. All the crew members were immediately deployed in extreme tension. This was because the captain had discovered a San Francisco-class Grade A cruiser, escorted by three destroyers, sailing under heavy guard. At that time, the Japanese submarine took up a favorable position, waiting quietly for an opportunity to ambush, preparing to break through the enemy's guard, etc., to directly hit the enemy heavy cruiser. It began to invade within the range of fire. At that time, the underwater listening device was constantly paying attention to the advance of the enemy fleet, and preparing for torpedo combat. The captain made a decision to closely observe the periscope in front of the enemy. At that time, it was occupying an excellent position, so the captain ordered to prepare to fire. The alarm bell kept ringing. After aiming, the captain ordered to fire. At this time, the alarm bell suddenly stopped, and several torpedoes sped away. One second, two seconds, waiting in tension for the sound of the hit to come. A very long time passed, and then a heavy sound of a hit came several times. This sound was also the sound of a large explosion. In this instant, the San Francisco-class enemy Grade A cruiser had been sunk. The total tonnage of the ship was 9,950 tons, the speed was 33 knots, and it was equipped with nine 39-centimeter guns. After the enemy's giant ship sank, the escorting destroyers frequently dropped depth charges into the water, attempting to counterattack, but the Japanese submarine had already turned its rudder to other waters at the bottom of the sea in triumph.</p>
<h3>German Ambassador to Japan Meets with Japanese Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - German Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Stahmer, visited Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu at 5:30 p.m. on the 28th, and had a sincere conversation on the current situation for more than half an hour. This was the second time the German ambassador visited Foreign Minister Shigemitsu since the coup in Italy, so Japan and Germany are making close contact.</p>
<h3>Britain Does Not Intend to Return Italian Colonies</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 28th (Central News Agency) - Someone raised a question in the Lower House today, asking whether Britain and its allies would return its former North African territories if Italy agreed to a "glorious" surrender. Foreign Secretary Eden replied with a simple "no."</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Between Two Armies on the Eastern Coast of Palermo; British Offensive East of Catania Obstructed by Fierce Axis Counterattack</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to news from the Sicilian front, the British offensive east of Catania has been obstructed by fierce Axis counterattacks and difficult terrain. Therefore, the war has shifted to the eastern coastal area of Palermo, and fierce fighting seems to be unfolding in this area. Former BBC special correspondent Tarnett stated that American and Canadian troops in Sicily are now encountering strong Axis counterattacks, and their resistance to the American counteroffensive in the northern area of Palermo is becoming increasingly stubborn. It is also reported that on the eastern front of Sicily, the British Eighth Army continues to engage in fierce fighting with Axis forces in the southwest of Catania. At the same time, in order to strengthen its forces, the German army seems to be continuously transporting personnel and supplies through the Strait of Messina. British newspaper correspondents have stated that the German army is currently using a large number of large transport aircraft to reinforce its forces, so the battle for Sicily will gradually enter a decisive stage.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) - Military officials in Berlin declared that General Patton, the commander-in-chief of the American forces in Sicily, has increased the number of troops in battle because he has been unable to develop his mechanized units in the mountainous areas and inland of Sicily. He obviously intends to do his best to liberate the coastal highway from Palermo to Messina. Another reason for General Patton's efforts is that General Montgomery's troops have failed to break through the German-Italian defense line on the northern edge of the Catania Plain. Counter-Axis forces have repeatedly been defeated in their attempts to attack eastward through the Sefula area. German swift bombers have also assisted in the battle, destroying countless American tanks and armored vehicles along the coastal highway. German and Italian troops stationed in favorable mountain positions east of Leonforte have repelled attacking Counter-Axis forces several times, preventing British and American command posts from advancing their front lines. On the left flank of the German defense line in Sicily, the troops under General Montgomery have been unable to enter the well-disguised positions of the German and Italian forces from the Catania Plain, and are now completely inactive. German anti-aircraft artillery units have contributed greatly to the victories in the past few days, shooting down 46 Counter-Axis aircraft last week. Four giant sailboats carrying troops have also been destroyed. Anti-aircraft artillery has destroyed 11 tanks, 3 armored reconnaissance vehicles, and 3 motorized artillery pieces. German anti-aircraft artillery units have destroyed many transport vehicles, greatly easing the pressure on the defensive front line. When German anti-aircraft artillery units fought against the British and American landing fleets, they destroyed 2 motor torpedo boats and 1 third-class gunboat. Several landing ships were also destroyed. In addition, a destroyer caught fire, and three British cruisers were heavily damaged.</p>
<h3>Churchill Urges Not to Underestimate Germany's Huge Strength, Air Defense Also Continuing to Strengthen</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to news from London, British Prime Minister Churchill stated in the House of Commons yesterday that Germany's national strength is very considerable, so the task of the Counter-Axis countries is even more important. Churchill warned not to underestimate the future huge task of the Counter-Axis countries in fighting Germany. He said that it will still be necessary to endure and overcome serious hardships and worries in the future. Germany's national strength is still very large, but it remains intact. Hitler still commands more than 300 German divisions, as well as the troops of its allies. Three-quarters of these German troops are mobilizable, and most of them are equipped extremely well. We are currently fighting a part of these German troops in Sicily. They are fighting bravely from their well-defended positions. The power of the German central government can penetrate all levels of German life. Germany also has more than a dozen huge resources that can be used. The Counter-Axis countries cannot make any major mistakes in this war.</p>
<h3>Soviet Offensive in Leningrad Region Repelled; German Forces Drive Out Soviet Troops from Kuban Bridgehead, Restoring Positions Lost Several Days Ago</h3>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) - Colonel Hammer, a German news agency war correspondent, stated that on Sunday, the defense of the Orel region continued, and the intensity did not diminish. At the same time, the war in the Mius region and the Kuban bridgehead, which had slightly eased in recent days, was intensified by the Soviet army. The eastern part of the encirclement zone on the Leningrad front was also under severe pressure from the Soviet army. In addition to artillery, tanks, and other heavy weapons, the Soviet army used a large number of aircraft in an attempt to break through the German resistance, but the Soviet army failed to prevail in any one place, and suffered heavy losses in manpower and material. On Sunday, the Soviet army lost a total of 228 tanks, of which 219 were destroyed by anti-aircraft guns and flat-trajectory guns, and the remaining 9 were destroyed by German Air Force tank-destroying aircraft. Most of these tanks were destroyed in the Orel region. Along the south side of the northern front of the Orel region, the Soviet command transferred and sacrificed a large number of infantry and tanks on Sunday to try again to break through. Elite Soviet infantry units, under the cover of several batches of tanks, launched a fierce attack on the German positions, but most of the attacking Soviet troops collapsed in front of the German lines. Those who penetrated the German positions were either annihilated by the flanking counterattacks of the German vanguard or by the local encirclement of the reserve troops. The second focus of the Soviet offensive activity remained in the Leningrad region. The German lines south of Lake Ladoga were subjected to concentrated attacks by newly reinforced enemy troops and tank units throughout the day. The Soviet army also used military aircraft to pave the way for its infantry regiments, but the Soviet attacks here also collapsed in front of German defensive fire. A Soviet operational team, under the cover of extra-heavy tanks, broke into the German lines, but after the German defenders immediately launched a counterattack, the Soviet army was completely annihilated. German light infantry launched a strong counterattack at the Kuban bridgehead, driving the Soviet troops out of the important heights in the Novorossiysk region. The area had been lost a few days earlier, but now the Germans are engaged in fierce fighting in the forests along the entire front line. The outcome will depend in part on hand-to-hand combat. The Soviet army suffered heavy casualties, with many killed and captured. Soviet troops and tank units launched a concentrated attack on the eastern part of the Kuban bridgehead, resulting in the loss of 15 tanks and 2 infantry regiments by the Soviet army. More than 4,000 Soviet soldiers were killed in front of the German lines, and 860 were captured. The Soviet attack in the Mius region also collapsed. The success of the German defense here was largely due to the Air Force. German bombers, dive bombers, and military aircraft attacked enemy strongholds and encampments, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. At this location on the front line, German and Romanian bombers attacked several Soviet artillery batteries, silencing them. In the evening, German bombers destroyed several railway stations in the Soviet rear, setting them on fire, and destroying several sections of the tracks. In the central Donets and Belgorod regions, there were only local battles on Sunday. The Soviet army had to reorganize its troops due to the heavy losses suffered in these two regions.</p>
<h3>Progress of the Fourth Central Cooperation Conference of Japan</h3>
<p>Day 2 (15th) (Continued)</p>
<p>Fourth Committee: Discussing various issues of wartime living, "Twelve proposals regarding the establishment of wartime living were submitted. The focus of the discussion started with the clothing issue. Some advocated expanding the value of national uniforms, some advocated stopping the use of electricity for women's perms, and some advocated making clothing as simple and light as possible. The discussion then turned to the issue of food, and everyone unanimously hoped to establish a standard for daily food rations and implement appropriate rationing. For pregnant women, nursing mothers, and infants, the ration should be particularly rich due to their relation to national health.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo's Speech</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo arrived at the Fourth Committee at 8:45 p.m. to listen to the deliberations. He said that attention should be paid to the Committee's discussions on clothing, food, housing, rationing, public health, and culture. Finally, he stood up and delivered a speech, saying:</p>
<p>"I believe that your opinions on wartime living are very important and can be used as a reference for future food rationing issues. However, everything always has shortcomings. The government and the people should both take responsibility for remedying them. It is laughable to say that Japan lacks food. Recently, a person who returned to Japan from Germany via the Soviet Union and Manchuria said that when entering Manchuria from the Soviet Union, he thought it was heaven, and when returning to Japan from Manchuria, he thought it was paradise. You are concerned about the next generation of citizens and care about the food supply for pregnant women and infants. In fact, it is not just the food issue, the government is doing its best to solve all problems so that our 100 million people have no worries about living. The purpose of the Greater East Asia War is not only for Japan, but also for a greater responsibility, to ensure that the nations of the Greater East Asia are in their proper places. We Japanese must shoulder this responsibility." The entire venue was deeply moved by the Prime Minister's speech.</p>
<p>Day 3 (16th)</p>
<p>The general meeting was convened at 8:00 a.m. on this day. First, Major General Taniogi of the Army Information Department stood up to report on the military situation (the speech can be found in this newspaper on July 17), which lasted 45 minutes. Then, Lieutenant Commander Tashiro of the Navy reported on the situation of the fierce battles in the South Pacific (the speech can be found in this newspaper on July 17). The tone of the speech was enthusiastic and sincere, and the entire venue was moved. At this time, Chairman Kobayashi proposed to draft a "Pledge to Win the Greater East Asia War" to express their determination, which was unanimously passed by the entire venue, and 15 committee members were elected to draft it.</p>
<p>Then, the agenda began. First, Chairman Hazama of the First Committee reported, and then Director Takei of the Ministry of Health and Welfare and Chief Ishikawa of the Training Bureau of the Wing Assistance Association stated their opinions on the various proposals to promote the wartime spirit.</p>
<p>Then, Chairman Gogo of the Second Committee reported on the various proposals to enhance war production, and President Inoue of the Technology Institute reported on the level of science and technology in Japan, the achievements since the establishment of the Technology Institute, and its guiding principles. Finally, he hoped that the people would cooperate with the government in light of the seriousness of the current situation.</p>
<p>The Truth About Enterprise Consolidation</p>
<p>Next, Minister of Commerce Kishi explained the truth about enterprise consolidation, the consolidation of various industrial sectors, to maintain the minimum level of national life during wartime, to do his best to ensure the production of essential materials for national life, and to ensure smooth and smooth rationing. Finally, he hoped that the national life should be further thoroughly simplified. Minister of Commerce Kishi finished his speech and took a temporary break.</p>
<p>The meeting continued in the afternoon. Minister of Communications Terajima explained the government's recent shipping policies and the various preferential treatments for sailors, and awarded medals on "Marine Day" to commend the sailors' achievements. Then, Minister of Education Okabe explained the situation of the "Outline for Establishing a Wartime Student Mobilization System" (the text can be found in this newspaper on July 3 and 4).</p>
<p>Then, Chairman Oda of the Third Committee reported on the various proposals regarding self-sufficiency in food and a very large increase in production, and Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Yamashita explained the recent food shortage situation in Japan, which has relied on foreign imports. Then, he strongly emphasized the need to establish a self-sufficient food system to get rid of the state of dependence on foreign rice.</p>
<p>Practicing Wartime Living</p>
<p>Finally, Chairman Funada of the Fourth Committee reported on the various proposals regarding the practice of wartime living, and Minister of Interior Ando forcefully spoke about the importance of wartime living. One section was most noteworthy. The Minister of Interior said: "The practice of wartime living is the foundation for enhancing war production and the basis for completing the war. In view of the current stage of the war, our people should thoroughly implement the original Japanese Bushido spirit and establish a simple, robust, and solid war life. Unfortunately, some of the people's lack of awareness of the war has led to continuous illegal acts regarding food and other materials. In order to ensure the national life, the government is actively engaged in increasing food production and appropriately rationing essential materials, so it will decisively implement various crackdown measures against those who violate the controlled economy. Therefore, we hope that all citizens will reform their clothing, food, and housing, practice thrift in consumption, increase savings, and move towards the practice of wartime living." Minister of Health and Welfare Koizumi then reported on the recent situation of the health promotion movement, and Minister of Finance Kura demanded that the people practice diligence, thrift, and savings to preserve and increase the country's vitality. At this point, the agenda was completed.</p>
<p>Recitation of the Pledge of Victory</p>
<p>At this time, the "Pledge of Victory" drafted in another room was also completed. Chairman Kobayashi recited it in a solemn manner and then announced the end of the meeting. At 5:00 p.m., the closing ceremony was held. All the councilors and staff went to the Nijubashi Bridge to pay homage to the Imperial Palace, returned to the meeting place, sang the national anthem, and prayed. Then, President Tojo gave the closing speech, and the meeting was adjourned at 6:30 p.m. After the adjournment, the councilors attended the president's dinner party together. (Wing)</p>

<p>The public and French concessions in this city will be returned to our country on schedule. By this point, all foreign concessions in the country will have been returned to sovereignty. The root of Anglo-American aggression in East Asia for a century has been completely eliminated amidst the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession will make Greater Shanghai a true gateway to China. Therefore, its future development is worthy of attention. The authorities are making the greatest effort to plan all future management of Shanghai. In addition to the various agencies stationed in Shanghai actively strengthening themselves, special supervisory committees for the takeover of the concessions have also been appointed. In Shanghai, Mayor Chen will serve as the center, coordinating with all relevant parties to study specific strategies for future management. The zoning of the city and the organization of the police force have been largely determined internally.</p>
<p>French Concession Awards Bonuses to Police Officers</p>
<p>The French Concession police authorities, in view of the imminent return of the French Concession and the meritorious service of the Chinese and Russian police officers since their employment, have decided to award bonuses. The measures have been stipulated, calculated on the basis of monthly salary, with one month's salary universally distributed, plus one-third of the monthly salary for each year of service, but limited to six months' salary. Distribution began yesterday (the 28th). As for the public accumulation fund and savings fund issues of the police officers, the authorities have not yet formally made any statement.</p>
<p>Municipal Council Handles Closing Matters</p>
<p>The Municipal Council, because the Public Concession has been decided to be formally returned on August 1st, has begun to handle closing matters. All departments have been actively sorting out various documents and equipment in order to comprehensively handle the handover. As for the police officers, although they are in the closing period, they must still work and absolutely must not slack off, ensuring the security of the concession.</p>
<p>Memorial Mass</p>
<p>The French Concession police authorities, in view of the imminent return of the concessions, will hold a memorial mass at the St. Joseph's Church on Rue Luberne at 8:30 a.m. today (the 29th) to commemorate the police officers who died in the line of duty over the years. The police superintendent, Fabre, and other senior police officers will attend the ceremony, which will be solemn and grand.</p>
<p>Expanded Propaganda</p>
<p>The Municipal Propaganda Office, in order to celebrate the recovery of the concessions, has organized temporary propaganda teams, divided into six squads, carrying a large number of horizontal banners, red cloth celebratory slogans, large slogans, long slogans, window slogans, small slogans, and pictorial slogans, totaling dozens of types, reaching more than one million items, to be posted along the way. The work is intense and progress is rapid.</p>
<p>Celebration Program</p>
<p>All sectors of this city, in order to celebrate the recovery of the concessions, will hang flags for three days, from August 1st to 3rd, to celebrate this epoch-making event. Under the planning and guidance of the Municipal Propaganda Office, the Shanghai Special Municipal People's Anti-British and Anti-American Assembly will be held at the Da Guangming Theater on Jing'an Temple Road at 3 p.m. next month (August 1st). At that time, the Baojia authorities and people's organizations of each district of the city, as well as various agencies, will send representatives to enthusiastically participate. The Huxi District Baojia Office of this city, in addition to sending personnel to participate in the assembly, has also decided to build three decorated archways at the entrance of the Paramount Ballroom on Yu Garden Road, the entrance of the Zhaofeng Garden on Route Tenant de Villiers, and the border of the French Concession on Hongqiao Road, which will be the responsibility of the three fang offices in the district to build separately. At that time, various propaganda slogans will be posted at key points on the roads in the district to promote the public's understanding of the recovery of the concessions.</p>
<h3>Joint Association of Various Industries: Disaster Relief Funds for North China Amount to 360,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>According to a Commercial Control Association (商統會) announcement, donations for the North China disaster relief efforts have been enthusiastic from all sides. The fundraising results of the joint associations of various industries under the association's umbrella are also considerable. The reported amounts currently are: (1) Joint Association of Grain Industries in various districts, totaling 123,600 yuan; (2) Joint Association of Leather Industries, totaling 66,765 yuan; (3) Joint Association of Metal Industries, totaling 170,000 yuan, totaling more than 360,000 yuan, all of which have been submitted to the designated banks for verification.</p>
<h3>42nd Rationed Rice and Flour Sales to End Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The sales of the 42nd period of household rice and flour rations will end tomorrow (the 30th). On the 31st, all rice shops will suspend sales for one day. Starting from the 1st of next month, the 43rd period of household rice and flour will be sold on schedule. Regarding the household rice, the first batch of 150,000 bags of rice transported from other ports by the Rice and Grain Joint Operation Society has reached three-quarters, and the quantity is expected to be restored to two sheng. This is still subject to official announcement.</p>
<p>Ministry of Food Makes Maximum Supply</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th) Before June, the Ministry of Food supplied 50,000 bags of rice per month to the Shanghai area for civilian consumption. Since June, this has been increased to 150,000 bags per month. All of the rice for July, 100,000 bags have been allocated from the Su-Song-Chang-Jia area, 20,000 bags from Yangzhou, and 30,000 bags from Huzhou, all transported to Shanghai by the Shanghai Rice and Grain Joint Operation Society and have already begun distribution. As for the rice to be allocated in August, the Ministry of Food has also made arrangements to allocate 100,000 bags from the Su-Song-Chang-Jia area, 20,000 bags from Yangzhou, and 30,000 bags from Nanjing, and has sent telegrams to the Shanghai Municipal Food Bureau and the Rice and Grain Joint Operation Society to quickly pay and start transportation to supply distribution.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's First Orphanage: A Tour of the Tushanwan Orphanage (5)</h3>
<p>The metalwork and carpentry departments are also renowned at the Tushanwan Orphanage. In terms of metalwork, current products are mostly statues of saints, instruments for worship, large bells, and exquisitely crafted utensils for domestic use, including knives, forks, cups, and plates, complete in every variety. However, due to the scarcity of metallic raw materials, the workshop is not as busy as it once was. The work of manufacturing metal utensils has almost come to a standstill, and the beautiful and exquisite gold-plating and silver-plating work is also not as good as before. This is a result of the war, and the impact on all aspects of the economy is considerable. In terms of carpentry, although raw materials are scarce, like metal, the workshop is still active. Here, there are separate sections for Chinese and Western woodworking, carving and sculpture, gilding and silvering, painting and varnishing, etc. Each piece of work by the apprentices has a score given by the technician, mostly above 70 points. In terms of finished products, there is a set of exquisite teak furniture, with figures, flowers, birds, and animals all carved in three dimensions, its delicate and lively nature comparable to ivory carvings from India. Other household utensils and display items, toys, general tools, etc., are all available in large and small sizes, creating a magnificent sight. What is especially rare are the various clay, wood, and plaster sculptures and images, from saints to historical figures to modern celebrities, which are dazzling. As long as they have an ordinary photograph, they can sculpt them as lifelike as flesh and blood, not only capturing the likeness but also conveying the spirit and charm, truly remarkable works.</p>
<p>Life in the Orphanage</p>
<p>Such a complete and beautiful orphanage is also inevitably affected by the tide of rising prices, which has put the orphans, workers, and managers in great difficulty. The orphans eat one meal and two bowls of porridge a day, using rationed rice. In the past, they received 15 bags each from the French and Chinese sides each month, totaling 36 shi (including rice subsidies for workers), paying more than 250 yuan per shi. However, recently they often cannot receive it, and the Food Bureau only provides a quarter of it. Therefore, the food shortage is becoming increasingly serious, and they eat bran soup in the morning and evening. Dishes are naturally out of the question. There are 38 skilled workers living in the orphanage and 75 living outside. In addition to providing meals, they receive a monthly salary of 100 to 120 yuan, and 2 dou of rice are subsidized. Those with wives receive an additional 1 dou, and those with children over seven years old receive an additional 1 dou per child, and those under seven receive half a dou. Dormitories are also provided. This expenditure is already considerable. Due to the difficulty of obtaining food, 35 of the 276 orphans have been selected to eat in Sijing, and another 35 have been selected to reside in Yushan, but all expenses are still borne by the orphanage. As for clothing and bedding, they are mostly old stocks, and now many are tattered and unable to be replaced, and autumn and winter are approaching, causing anxiety. The actual workers, from the person in charge, Father Lu, to the 7 priests, 11 cooks, 5 teachers, and several staff members, are completely dedicated to educating orphans as their lifelong career, sacrificing and serving, without enjoying a single cent or dime. However, how can they save the economic crisis? In the past, the orphanage's funding sources were one, donations from abroad; two, subsidies from the Shanghai Catholic Church; and three, the best-selling products of the orphanage's workshops in Nanyang and Africa. Now these three major sources of income have been cut off, and their expenses have soared with rising prices. According to the lowest estimate, the food expenses for each orphan per year require more than 1,000 yuan, and 300 people require 300,000 yuan. The total amount for fuel, water, electricity, clothing, books, medicine, teacher salaries, wages, etc., is also staggering, with monthly expenditures exceeding 50,000 yuan. This spring, they requested subsidies from the Shanghai Poverty Relief Association, and after Mr. Ji Zhengang and Mr. Yao Huiquan, members of the association, went to investigate, they first subsidized 25,000 yuan once, and then continued to subsidize 15,000 yuan in June, allowing the orphanage to breathe a sigh of relief. However, with soaring prices now, the orphanage is still in great distress. The reporter sees the orphans' faces yellow and thin, their clothes tattered, which is very inconsistent with their exquisite and brilliant work, and imagining their future, I can't help but feel heartache and tears. The various workshops of the orphanage were originally Shanghai's industrial pioneers and participated in various exhibitions at home and abroad, winning 19 medals. The skills of the current technicians and apprentices have reached a highly proficient level. If there is funding to add raw materials, supplement machinery, and expand sales channels, the future development is infinitely promising. Therefore, today, we especially hope that charitable and enlightened people from all walks of life will generously donate, or purchase the orphanage's various products, or introduce them to relatives and friends, and work together to assist, so that hundreds of orphans can be educated successfully and the orphanage's cause can be maintained and developed. We must not allow such a Shanghai orphanage with a long history and outstanding achievements, such a charitable organization that implements a semi-work-study program to cultivate talents for society and the country, to decline.

<h3>Last Batch of Factories Under Military Control Returned Yesterday</h3>
<p>In order to fulfill the Sino-Japanese treaty and build the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the friendly Japanese authorities have returned 140 factories in the Central China area managed by the Japanese army since October 31, 1940, batch by batch. Now, with the two concessions in Shanghai to be recovered by the Chinese government at the end of this week, in order to help complete the development of China's total industrial strength, the remaining ten factories under management were all returned. The thirteenth handover ceremony of Japanese military factories was held at 3 p.m. yesterday (the 28th). Those present included Lieutenant Colonel Fukuyama, director of the Japanese military-controlled factories; Mr. Mori, investigator of the Japanese Embassy Office; Mr. Yuan Yuzhuan, Vice Minister of Industry of the National Government, representing the National Government; Mr. Zhang Jun, director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry; Commissioner Fan Guangwu; Section Chief Tang Maoxi; and more than 40 representatives of the Japanese trustees of each factory and the Chinese legitimate rights holders. After the ceremony was performed, the two parties completed the handover procedures of the factories. First, Director Fukuyama and Vice Minister Yuan of the Ministry of Industry delivered speeches successively, explaining the significance of the last batch of factories to be handed over. Then, the representative of the Japanese trustees of the managed factories reported on the operating situation of the managed factories. Finally, Chen Shen, managing director of Dasheng Textile Factory, gave a speech of thanks. Finally, everyone toasted with champagne and celebrated until the ceremony ended at about 5 p.m.</p>
<p>Speech by Director Fukuyama</p>
<p>Director Fukuyama said in his speech, in brief, that the ten factories returned today are important industries in the Jiangbei and Chongming areas. It is necessary to learn from the spirit of the late Qing Dynasty industrialist Zhang Jian, who managed the factory industry for decades. The trustee-run enterprises in the Northern Jiangsu region have generated profits of more than 14 million yuan to date, and have made great contributions to public undertakings such as transportation, water conservancy, hospitals, and schools. Now, the general industrial circles in China have already known the true intentions of Japan towards China. He hoped that each factory would recognize its responsibility, work hard to promote industry, and jointly plan for the completion of the Greater East Asia Construction.</p>
<p>Speech by Vice Minister Yuan of the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>Today, we are holding the thirteenth ceremony for the return of factories under military control. A total of ten factories are being returned, all of which are factories in the Nantong and Chongming areas. Speaking of Nantong and other places, they originally occupied a very important position in the history of Chinese industry, the industry was very developed, and it developed very early, and the foundation was very solid. The center of Chinese industry, in addition to Shanghai and Wuxi and other places, will be Nantong and other places. After this incident, if it were not for the care of the friendly naval and military authorities, I am afraid that this industrial center would have been destroyed. But now, it is still being returned to the legitimate rights holders in good condition. How should we express our heartfelt thanks to the goodwill of the friendly naval and military authorities for the benefit of the future of Chinese industry.</p>
<p>Now the Japanese military authorities and the National Government's Ministry of Industry have completed a major mission. I would like to express my deep gratitude to the friendly country on behalf of the National Government. At the same time, I hope that the leaders of the Jiangbei industrial sector will follow the spirit of Mr. Zhang Jian in the past and contribute to the Great East Asia War. The staff of the Military Management Factory Consolidation Committee have spent a lot of effort in the past four years to complete this major mission, and I would like to express my infinite gratitude on behalf of the Ministry of Industry of the National Government.</p>
<h3>Chinese Inspectors of the French Police Receive Silver Medals</h3>
<p>Chinese inspectors of the French police, Gui Baoquan, Zhu Gunong, Zhou Buguang, Dai Rongji, and Lu Zhulin, have served for many years, have always been diligent in public service, and have made remarkable contributions. They have been reported to the Police Superintendent and the French Consul General, and were awarded silver medals. By special order, Gui Baoquan and others were summoned to the French General Assembly on Avenue MacMahon at 4 pm yesterday, where they were personally awarded and decorated by French Consul General Magre.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Cigarettes to be Distributed Soon; Severe Penalties for Sales Above Price Limits</h3>
<p>According to the *Shanghai Times*, there has been a recent shortage of cigarettes on the market. It is understood that the Huazhong Tobacco Distribution Association will distribute Da Jing cigarettes in large quantities within two or three days. It has been found that some cigarettes are not being sold to retail customers at the limited price. The authorities will severely punish such situations.</p>
<h3>Evolution of the Guangzhao Public Hall</h3>
<p>— Wen Zongyao</p>
<p>The Shanghai Guangzhao Public Hall was established in the eleventh year of the Tongzhi reign of the late Qing Dynasty. From that year until the end of the Xuantong reign, all affairs were handled by the directors. I joined the board of directors in the second year of the Xuantong reign. At that time, the free school run by the Public Hall only had 200 male students, and the free school for girls had not yet been established. The number of male students increased to 300 in the early years of the Republic, and there were more than 1,000 students registered waiting to be admitted. At that time,</p>
<p>Five Blessing Star (五福星)</p>
<p>Houses were all occupied by the firm businesses of the two areas of Guangzhao, with an annual rental income of only 8,000 taels. Subtracting repair and land tax expenses, the actual net income was only about 6,000 taels. Public-spirited fellow countrymen from the two areas have repeatedly proposed increasing the rental income to expand the number of students accepted, but were met with opposition. In the sixth year of the Republic, I proposed increasing the rental income, and without fear of strong opposition, insisted on the matter to the end. Those unwilling to pay more had to move out immediately. At that time, there were 31 directors in total, and only 3, Hu Yaoting, Huang Boping, and Tan Haiqiu agreed with me. Two were neutral, Wu Tingfang and Tang Shaoyi. The remaining 27 directors were extremely opposed to the idea. A major upheaval thus arose, and those who opposed the increase moved out of Wufu Lane. I then leased the buildings in Wufu Lane to outsiders, increasing the annual rental income from 8,000 to over 20,000 taels. Thus, the number of male students increased from 300 to 1,200, and a free school for girls was established at the same time. The system of councilors was also established. I ordered the clerk Xu Zhishong to work with the accountant Li Yongxing to draft the articles of association to be submitted to the board of directors for discussion, but the majority opposed it, and it was never established, remaining a draft to this day. Ten years later, the number of students registered and waiting to be admitted increased to over 1,000 again. At that time, the Shanghai Bank wanted the Public Hall to demolish the houses along the river and the houses in Wufu Lane, and lease the entire area to build Western-style buildings for the bank to use. The Bank was willing to pay 80,000 taels in annual rental income. However, this was opposed by the Guangdong Club, because at that time the Public Hall was renting the floor space to the Club at a monthly rental income of only 75 yuan. The Club demanded that after the Shanghai Bank's new building was completed, the Public Hall would lease the entire floor to them at a monthly rental income not exceeding 75 yuan. This was an impossible condition, and therefore they opposed it strongly, even to the point of litigation. But I insisted on the matter to the end, and the lease was eventually established. The number of male students increased from 1,200 to 2,500 per year, and the number of female students increased to over 500. The Public Hall's long-standing practice is that it is unwilling to sell property that generates monthly income, but can sell property that generates no monthly income and is useless, in order to establish beneficial businesses. There is precedent for this. On the sixth day of the twelfth month of the thirty-second year of the Guangxu reign, the</p>
<p>Old Mountain Villa (舊山莊)</p>
<p>of 71 mu, one fen, seven li, and eight hao on Xinza Road was sold to the Guangzhao Industrial Company. This matter is recorded in the Public Hall's annual credit report, which can be found easily. The Public Hall is now selling the Old Mountain Villa at Chedaijiao, and this is based on that precedent. The authorities have urged the relocation of the Old Mountain Villa at Chedaijiao, and the deadline has passed. The land of the Mountain Villa is 116 mu. It is now sold to the Tongyi Real Estate Company for 10.4 million yuan. At the very least, 116 mu must be added to the new Mountain Villa at Dachang to make up for the number of mu sold. The new Mountain Villa at Dachang currently has only 173 plots left unburied. If new land is not purchased immediately, the ancestors of the two counties will have no place to be buried. If the unprofitable Mountain Villa at Chedaijiao is not sold, there will be no funds to purchase new land at the New Mountain Villa. In addition, the Guangzhao Boys' School, Girls' School, and Hospital have been occupied by friendly countries and have not yet been returned. If the unprofitable Mountain Villa at Chedaijiao is not sold, there will be no funds to purchase the school sites for boys and girls, and school buildings cannot be built, and education cannot progress. The poor fellow countrymen cannot be given medicine. The Public Hall has always operated according to custom, and even when it is extremely poor and in urgent need of funds, it is unwilling to sell income-generating property, but can only temporarily raise public debt. In the thirteenth year of the Republic, the burial plots at the Old Mountain Villa at Chedaijiao were full, and new Mountain Villas had to be purchased at Dachang, requiring tens of thousands of yuan. The method of raising public debt was used to make up the shortfall, and this matter is also detailed in the WeChat record. Now is the time to sell the Old Mountain Villa at Chedaijiao to establish various public welfare undertakings, so I have briefly described the evolution of the Public Hall above.</p>
<h3>News Association Celebrates the Return of the Concessions; Lecture Meeting Concludes Successfully; Lin Kanghou Speaks on Living and Working in Peace</h3>
<p>The Shanghai News Association, in order to celebrate the National Government's scheduled implementation of the return of the two concessions in this city, organized a lecture meeting on the return of the concessions. Yesterday (the 28th) was the third day, that is, the last day of the meeting. At 8 pm, it continued to be held at the Yujing Grand Theater, inviting Mr. Lin Kanghou, an authority in the Chinese economic circles, to speak. More people from all walks of life in this city went to listen to the lecture than ever before, and the seats were full. The meeting started on time. The presidium, Mr. Obisaka and Mr. Kin Yu-hak (represented by Mr. Rikko Keigetsu), held the ceremony. Then Mr. Kin Yu-hak, representative of the presidium Rikko Keigetsu, delivered the opening speech. Then Mr. Lin gave a detailed lecture. After the lecture, the China Film Corporation's anti-British and anti-American blockbuster "Flower Girl" was screened. The meeting adjourned at 11 pm. The grand lecture meeting held by the Shanghai News Association ended successfully.</p>
<p>Lin Speaks on Living and Working in Peace</p>
<p>The gist of Mr. Lin's speech is as follows: I am very happy that you are here to enthusiastically participate in the celebration of the return of the concessions lecture meeting organized by the News Association. The return of the concessions this time was completed with the assistance of our friendly neighbor, Japan, fulfilling our country's wishes. Now that the day of the return of the concessions is approaching, I have two sentences to say, namely "one is to be happy, the other is to be fearful." The happy thing is that our country has been bound by Britain and the United States for a hundred years, and once we are liberated, it is a matter of joy and delight. However, in addition to being happy, we have to consider the future, how to develop the construction of Greater Shanghai, and strive to build a new China. Our responsibility is to seek peace and contentment, which is what all citizens hope for. How to make them live and work in peace in this city? Since December 8th two years ago, with the help of our friendly neighbor, crimes have been reduced and gradually disappeared. Therefore, the people's peace and contentment should be to eliminate violence and promote good. In the past, the concessions were protected by foreign forces, and everyone regarded them as a comfortable nest. Once there was a local war, the citizens all moved to the concessions, developing a mentality of seeking peace. Now that the concessions are about to be returned, perhaps some people think that peace and comfort will lose their protective effect and worry about the future's living and working in peace. In fact, this kind of mentality is all cultivated in the pursuit of peace, so in the future, to seek real peace and contentment, we must never rely on the mentality of seeking peace again. In addition to expecting the government, what we urgently hope that the citizens can do is (1) to have an active responsibility for everything and strive to be frugal; (2) not to seek private interests for oneself, but to give priority to the public interest; (3) the current Baojia system, which is being promoted, is very effective for living and working in peace, and should be strengthened to make it more effective, and so on.</p>

<p>To celebrate the takeover of the concessions, the Three Provinces Sports Association will host a charity football match between the Three Provinces team and a strong Western team. It is scheduled to open on August 2nd (Monday) at the Lyceum Theatre, and the second match will be held on August 6th (Friday).

<h3>Yesterday's United Football Team Defeated St. Portuguese Three Times: The Score Was Four to Three</h3>
<p>The last act of the Huatong Cup charity football match, United played against St. Portuguese for the third time, at the Xuhui Middle School Stadium at 6 pm yesterday. Yesterday, the St. Portuguese soldiers, after careful planning and tactics, used their lives for the army, so the momentum was very turbulent, while the United soldiers calmly responded to the battle, and the whole army worked hard. Because the ball skills were superior, the result was a 4-3 victory by one goal. Once again, the audience cheered and celebrated for the United team. Before the main show, the Chinese team played against the Chinese Film Interlude, and the result was a 1-1 draw.</p>
<p>The referee Zhang Le blew the whistle for the United vs. St. Portuguese match, and St. Portuguese immediately attacked. A. Cola Sha skillfully passed the ball to Fuen, who was about to rush forward and shoot hard. Xian Han was quick-witted and saved the ball. United immediately launched a counterattack, but unfortunately, they missed the opportunity. After ten minutes, Yi Chen got a supply from the rear and passed it to Qixiang. Wubian passed Schulz and sent it to Old Sun. Old Sun rushed forward and scored, opening the 1-0 record. Since then, St. Portuguese launched a counterattack, but all failed because the United defense was solid. At 23 minutes, Gao Baozheng got a ball from Old Sun and made another great achievement, with United leading 2-0. Until nearly the end of the first half, United's Song Lingsheng committed a handball in the penalty area, and Victor Taille scored a penalty kick, and then Carlo Liechti swept and scored again, with the score tied 2-2. In the second half, Fei Chunhua drank Huanglong and United took the lead again 3-2, and then St. Portuguese Carlo Lich scored again, and the two sides tied again. However, United relied on the final effort, and Fei Chunhua got a supply from Yi Chen two minutes before the end of the game and scored a goal, and won with a score of 4-3.</p>

<p>Economic Review</p>
<h3>Steps to Stabilize Prices</h3>
<p>A spokesman for the Public Works Department's Materials Control Committee discussed the steps to stabilize prices yesterday, summarizing them into two main points: (a) increasing the supply or production of major materials that can be obtained, and (b) reducing demand or consumption. In other words, it is to increase income and reduce expenditure.</p>
<p>We have said before that "increasing income and reducing expenditure" is a Chinese economic principle since ancient times. In today's controlled economy, it must be regarded as a guideline. Encouraging production and purchasing materials are ways to increase income, while restricting lending is a way to reduce expenditure. Now that the steps for increasing income and reducing expenditure have been decided, the most urgent problem is how these steps can be achieved.</p>
<p>Appropriate legal measures are the foundation for achieving these steps. Therefore, we hope that after the recovery of the concessions, legal measures will be more appropriate, and then economic measures may achieve faster results.</p>
<h3>Various Industry Evaluation Committees Actively Conduct Investigation Work</h3>
<p>Recently, the selling prices of various goods have been rising step by step. The main reason for this is the speculation of unscrupulous merchants. The authorities are now conducting further investigations into the relationship between hoarding and speculation. However, in order to assist the authorities in cracking down on speculation and hoarding, various industry associations have been urging member stores to strictly practice self-discipline in order to stabilize prices and ensure people's livelihood. In addition to earnestly advising their members, various industry associations are also actively conducting investigation work. Those who are responsible for this mission are the evaluation committees of various industries, who are responsible for evaluating and setting the selling prices of various goods. At the same time, they are also responsible for reporting and punishing illegal stores. In recent days, the evaluation committees of various industries have dispatched a large number of investigators to various stores and outlets within the boundary to conduct strict investigations, and will severely punish illegal stores.</p>
<p>Formulating Various Business Regulations</p>
<p>The evaluation committees of various industries have specially formulated various business regulations and ordered each store to abide by them. The main points of the regulations are as follows: (1) Member companies of the same industry must abide by the price limits for goods at all levels set by this association, and sell at the price limit, and must not disobey secretly and sell at a higher price. (2) It is not allowed to engage in black market transactions, or to have illegal actions of buying and selling short. (3) A report form must be filled out in duplicate every month (or every ten days) and submitted to the association for reference. (4) Various goods are limited to being sold to legitimate users, and must not be resold to vendors or merchants outside the industry for profit. (5) When selling any goods at the door, the price limit set by this association should be marked. The size of the font and the style of the label shall be limited to those stipulated by the authorities, and must be placed in a conspicuous place so that every customer can easily see and distinguish clearly. (6) The weights and measures used must be suitable for the standard, and it is strictly forbidden to forge or be too long or too short, or too square or too small. (7) The purchase and sale of various goods must be entered in the register for future inspection by the authorities and investigators of this association at any time. When investigators ask to read the account books, they should promptly show the account books and must not have other excuses. (8) It is not allowed to conceal and refuse to sell the allocated goods, so as not to confuse people's hearts. (9) It is strictly forbidden to steal, reduce the quality, and reduce the quantity, in order to obtain unexpected profits. (10) If any of the above items are violated, they will be punished according to law or prosecuted to the court without any leniency.</p>
<h3>Securities Exchange Reopening Date Set</h3>
<p>The Chinese Securities Exchange was approved by the authorities and convened a temporary shareholders' meeting some time ago to plan for its reopening. According to a reporter from Shanghai News Agency, the exchange has internally decided to start trading on September 1st. The preparations are very tight these days. The registration of brokers is also actively underway. The location is being quickly arranged. If there are no unexpected complications, it should be able to reopen on schedule.</p>
<p>Term of Existence and Scope of Business</p>
<p>The exchange is organized in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Law and the Company Law of Limited Companies. The business area is Shanghai, and the term of existence is limited to ten years. After the expiration of the term, it can be extended with the resolution of the shareholders' meeting and submitted to the competent government department for approval. The scope of business is the buying and selling of various securities. It is prohibited to purchase or pledge real estate that is not required for business purposes, or to purchase or pledge the exchange's own shares, but the exchange's own shares received for debt repayment should be disposed of within four months. It is also prohibited to guarantee others in the name of the exchange.</p>
<p>The Authorities Plan to Formulate Operational Guidelines</p>
<p>The authorities' permission for the securities market to reopen this time is based on the aim of developing enterprises by using national funds through legitimate channels. Therefore, the authorities have determined the policy and instructed the securities exchange to adopt it as a countermeasure for post-reopening management. (1) Legalize and open the circulation of stocks, eliminate the black market, and bring idle funds into legitimate channels to develop enterprises and expand production. (2) The stocks of illegal companies must not be listed, and transactions are limited to spot transactions, and prices should be appropriately adjusted. (3) Speculation and manipulation are absolutely prohibited in the trading of Chinese stocks.</p>
<h3>Trend of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks suddenly changed, reversing downwards amidst steady gains. The reason is that the end of July is approaching. The overdraft accounts of silver and money industries must be settled, and there are more and more sellers seeking profit. If there is no special news to stimulate, it will turn into a consolidation phase this week. According to the people's sentiments, it is in a state of ambiguity. Most stocks saw a small squeeze. The Wing On Company of the department store industry finally stood firm after retreating to the customs gate. Sincere and China National Goods Company both fell slightly. The price of innerwear rose sharply at first, but although it fell back, it still saw a squeeze upwards. Jingfu shirts and socks were pushed up by buyers at noon after entering the customs gate. Jinglun oranges saw a soft drop. Lane Crawford was stable. In the textile industry, Wing On Textile, Sincere, Rongfeng, Sun Sun, and Great China Weaving all saw a consolidation downwards.

<p>Another report, China Investment Company, was organized by Wu Yunzhai, Shi Jiumao, Yao Qingsan, etc., with a capital of 6 million yuan and a par value of 10 yuan per share. The market price of the stock has already risen by one time the par value, it is said.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Food Investigates Agricultural Production in Urban Areas</h3>
<p>Since the war, rural areas in various places have been burned by soldiers, and agricultural production has been sharply reduced, which directly and indirectly affects the social livelihood of the people. Since the central government has actively advocated agricultural production in order to suppress prices, agricultural production in various places has increased sharply, and the rural economy has shown a general revival. The suburbs of this city have always been rich in agricultural products, and the food supply for the metropolis relies on this. In order to understand the development of agricultural production in this city, the Ministry of Food has specially ordered the Municipal Food Bureau to conduct a detailed investigation and report, and plans to register private farms in order to comprehensively supervise and guide, accelerate agricultural production, and build a balance between production and sales.</p>
<h3>The Edible Oil Industry Association Strictly Prohibits the Black Market</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Edible Oil Industry Association believes that edible oil is of great importance to people's food, so it tries to dredge the raw materials for oil extraction to enable oil mills to increase production. The association, in view of the recent surge in black market prices of blended oil, believes that this situation is obviously manipulated and profited by unscrupulous merchants, so it strictly prohibits the industry from concurrently operating in the black market. Once discovered, it will be severely punished. The association will dredge sources on the one hand, and thoroughly eliminate the black market on the other, so that people's livelihood can be stabilized.</p>
<h3>Business Highlights</h3>
<p>Gold and Silver: The entry and exit of gold jewelry shops are still at a standstill. The off-market price rises first and then falls back. People's hearts are unsettled, and the price hovers outside the big gate. The price of silver taels remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Public Bonds: Unified public bonds suddenly saw horizontal jumps, and the five types all squeezed up greatly. Type C has exceeded 17, while the other four types are around 15.</p>

<p>Cotton Market: People's hearts continue to soften, transactions are very rare, and prices are also declining further. However, spot goods are firm.

<p>Miscellaneous Grains: Yesterday, there were still many arrivals by land and water, the sales market was sluggish, and the market was uniformly weak. Chongming Sha Huang is already within the nine gates.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities: Amidst the continuous search and purchase by various parties, market prices continue to fluctuate horizontally. The price of matches, Phoenix brand, has broken through the two major gates. Other brands such as Rose and Shanghai have also reached the customs gate. Candles and soaps continue to rise accordingly. Cigarettes continue to rise in price due to the exhaustion of inventory, but the number of transactions is small, because the tenth-term distribution is approaching, and both buyers and sellers are watching.</p>
<h3>Dynamics of Various Industry Associations</h3>
<p>Municipal Fisheries Association: In order to improve the knowledge and skills of people in the Shanghai fishing industry, improve their lives, and promote the development of fishery production, people in the Shanghai fishing industry have specially reorganized the original fisheries association and named it the "Shanghai Special Municipal Fisheries Association," which includes eight industries including river fresh seafood, seafood, aquatic product fishmongers, salted fish, fish vendors, and refrigeration.

<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>In recent years, gasoline has been under the unified control of military needs. Most of the vehicles that used gasoline in the past have now been converted to charcoal, which is inconvenient and costly. If alcohol is used instead, it is a better bet. It is known that the alcohol produced by the Sun Ya Yeast Factory is as high as 96 degrees or more. Most car users are now ordering alcohol from the factory, and they are rushing to produce it day and night to meet the needs. In addition, the factory produces two types of yeast, one for medicinal use and one for fermentation in bakeries. Recently, the production of enzyme tablets has been valued by the medical community.</p>

<h3>The Government Should Enforce Frugal Consumption</h3>
<p>— Shan Zhi</p>
<p>The national economic strategy during the war against foreign countries invariably calls for precise control in order to adjust the new relationship between supply and demand of materials that exceeds the norm, so as to ensure that the country's needs are not lacking and that the people's lives are not panicked. Externally, it is to enhance combat power, and internally, it is to stabilize people's hearts and consolidate the national foundation. This is the highest purpose of control. Therefore, any economic matters that can directly or indirectly affect the above purposes are included in the scope of control and managed. Therefore, the two most important points in the wartime economic policy program are "increasing production" and "frugal consumption."</p>
<p>In terms of the initial implementation of the above two items, the former is that the foundation of our country's agriculture, industry, and mining machinery is immature, and the fundamental plan relies on the establishment of heavy industry as a guide. However, it is difficult to reach the ideal state in a hurry. As for the latter, it is a matter within the scope of one's own efforts, which is only determined by the degree of effort, which is relatively easy.</p>
<p>At a time when the need for materials is urgent, in principle, the government should cherish useful items, even if the domestic output is still abundant and there is no shortage at the moment, so as not to allow the people to waste them unnecessarily. However, people's customs are mutually infected, and although they want to practice frugality, there are no rules to follow, so that the boundary between waste and frugality is unclear, only viewing personal economic ability as the center, scattered and disorderly, so the government should come out to support, formulate simple and easy-to-implement programs, first stop the manufacture of wasteful nature, so as to save the consumption of raw materials, followed by the management of consumers, to simplify life, and to enforce it with the spirit of "words must be followed." For example: prohibit the manufacture of all cosmetics, move raw materials to make soap and candles; prohibit the weaving of all patterned fabrics and satin, and stipulate pure color types that are easy to produce; standardize factory products, advocate that people wear standard colors; and so on, which can reduce unnecessary consumption, and the output of essential items can be increased accordingly.</p>
<p>In terms of the government's mandatory implementation plan, the people, regardless of rich or poor, must have the obligation to strictly obey and must not exceed it. Before making decisions, experts must carefully consider and study reasonable standard quantities for all essential items for the people's livelihood, both in terms of quality and quantity, and provide them at a fair price, all with clothing, food, housing, transportation, hygiene, education, etc. as the scope of enjoyment, and must fully maintain the welfare undertakings within the scope. From the perspective of rationed items, we must reduce the time for people to receive them as much as possible and strive for rationality in everything. On the one hand, eliminate all extravagance and luxury, as well as items that are not beneficial to the body and mind, such as smoking and gambling, so that ordinary people can be at peace in their jobs, and even wealthy families, also because the ways of consumption are reduced, the desire for profit is reduced, and the social atmosphere can be made simple. A single move can benefit several aspects, so the mandatory implementation of frugality is indeed an essential plan to ensure the stability of people's lives.</p>

<h3>From the "Aid-Students" Movement to Discuss the "Aid-Schools" Movement</h3>
<p>— Chen Shao</p>
<p>The purpose of the aid-students movement is very simple and clear: first, to popularize education; and second, to cultivate talent. However, the nature of these two objectives is quite different and cannot be discussed together. Therefore, the approaches taken are also different. Please find a separate discussion below:</p>
<p>(1) Popularizing Education Any collective organization must contain three levels: basic, middle, and upper. The basic level is the most extensive, the middle level is next, and the upper level is last, which is natural. However, each level must possess the conditions of its own position, and then the entire collective can be sound. As far as the country is concerned, the general public is its basic level and should each have common sense for daily life and understand their own natural duties. Those responsible for this training are primary school education institutions, so primary school education seeks to be universal, while middle school or university education does not seek to be universal. The reason is here. When poor children are unable to attend primary school, they should be assisted as much as possible to complete their minimum training to become a strong basic level for the country, but this is not enough to cultivate talent.</p>
<p>(2) Cultivating Talent Talent can be divided into two categories: first, administrative talent, who must have common sense of their position and the ability to promote policies and implement plans. Those responsible for this training are general middle schools or vocational education institutions. The second is leadership talent, who must possess profound intelligence in their position, understand national conditions, have insight into the current situation, and be able to plan programs and lead subordinates to move forward to achieve their ideal state. Those responsible for this training are university education institutions above the specialist level. Therefore, general outstanding individuals should not be limited to primary school, and only those with unique talents can enter university and achieve something. This is in terms of personnel selection. As for the role models of teachers and the excellence of equipment, it is indeed important in primary schools, but if we talk about cultivating talents, then the teachers and equipment of middle schools and universities are the true foundations of these two levels of education. The defect of Chinese education has always been here, and the failure of Chinese education is also here, and now it is getting worse. Therefore, middle school graduates often lack administrative ability, and university graduates find it even more difficult to have leadership skills. In the six years of primary school, even if it is impossible to cultivate ideal citizens, they will certainly not be illiterate, and they will still know how to be humble and polite. By the time they graduate from middle school, there are many who cannot even write clearly in Chinese, and they are arrogant and unscrupulous. Among university graduates, it is even rarer to find those who can independently study specialized topics. In addition, they are often absent-minded and have a listless will, so how can they bear heavy responsibilities and go far? Thus, it can be seen that going to middle school and university is one thing, and cultivating talent is another.</p>
<p>Popularizing education focuses on quantity, while cultivating talent focuses on quality. We say that there is a lack of talent, but this cannot be remedied by shoddy manufacturing. In terms of students, strict assessment is essential, and it is better to have a shortage than to allow unqualified people. In terms of schools, outstanding teachers and complete equipment are essential. Now, teachers at all levels are not only poor but also waiting to die, and all kinds of national books and instruments are reduced from simple to incomplete. Under the current state of war, it is indeed difficult to say that everything is perfect, but honestly, there are still many areas where we have not done our best. Those who treat schools as shops and only seek profit are essentially pests in the education world, and we will not discuss them here. Even those with good intentions who are determined to cultivate talent are helpless due to economic exhaustion. Although tuition fees have doubled compared to the past, they are still far behind the rampant rise in prices. As a result, the lives of teachers are becoming more and more difficult, and the deterioration of equipment is becoming more and more serious, until the efficiency of teaching is not only equal to zero but has the opposite result. Middle schools and universities that have form but no content are only enough to produce impetuous and arrogant young people who are neither high nor low. How can we talk about talent? Therefore, the current methods of the "aid-students" movement, when applied to primary schools, can at most make national education universal, and the goal of cultivating talent is still very far away. What can we do? We can advocate the "aid-schools" movement.</p>
<p>Education should originally be the full responsibility of the government to organize, promote, and make sure everything is perfect. However, in extraordinary times, the people should assist the government in areas where its strength does not reach. Expanding the spirit of "aid-students" is not impossible to "aid-schools." All institutions and methods are initially the same, and the only difference is the change of target, and the required funds are larger. Now, based on my limited knowledge, I will briefly list the outline for implementing the "aid-schools" movement for the reference of those who sympathize with it. The more difficult a thing is, the more we must concentrate all our efforts to do it. Therefore, honest and upright people should organize a central hub for the aid-schools movement to take on the important responsibilities of soliciting, managing, selecting, distributing, and assessing. 2. When soliciting funds, simultaneously select the most worthy of assistance among existing middle schools and universities in order to proceed quickly and achieve results early. If the financial resources are strong, help more; if the financial resources are weak, help less. It is also acceptable. If a reasonable middle school and university can be produced in a short period of time after the aid-schools movement is implemented, it will be enough to establish a reputation and encourage future development. 3. There are two ways to aid schools: (A) Provide funding to improve equipment. Select the existing schools with the fewest defects, first supplement them, and strive to ensure that all teaching equipment, although it cannot have everything it should have, must reach its proper standard within the scope permitted by the current environment. (B) Assist teachers. Select teachers who can be called role models and support their lives, so that they no longer have to worry about supporting their families and can devote all their efforts to serving education. Those with too many part-time jobs should be changed to full-time, and those who dare to leave their jobs should be persuaded to return. If things are handled properly and there are no shortcomings, the assisted schools and assisted teachers will all be considered the highest honor. Then, the school spirit will flourish, and the teacher's way will be respected. The impact of this will not be limited to one school and one teacher. 4. Since assisted schools do not rely on tuition fees to maintain themselves, the admission of students must be careful, and the graduation of students must be strict, so as not to waste limited financial resources and fail. Students who are able to study or graduate from assisted schools, as well as those who study under the tutelage of assisted teachers, must also consider it the highest glory. Thus, the evils of stealing fame and padding numbers can be eliminated. 5. Since assisted schools have sufficient equipment, they can engage in production in addition to teaching, so that students can be more familiar with practice, and at the same time, use their surplus to further enrich themselves or transfer assistance to other schools, which will yield great benefits. 6. In addition to teaching students, assisted teachers should use their spare time to engage in writing, which will not only contribute to the cultural world but also use their royalties to assist other teachers and promote a spirit of mutual learning and mutual assistance.</p>
<p>There is an abundance of idle capital in Shanghai, and stirring it up is enough to endanger people's livelihoods and subvert the country. I hope that wealthy merchants and large buyers will abandon the pursuit of windfall profits and engage in long-term plans, especially in these days of multiple difficulties, make plans for the future. Seeing the popularization of education and the emergence of talent is much more comforting than indulging in momentary pleasure. I would like to appeal to all circles to expand the aid-students movement into the aid-schools movement!</p>

<h3>Contributing to the Business Control Association and its Lower-Level Institutions</h3>
<p>— Yang Liren</p>
<p>The National Business Control Association has been established for four months. Its lower-level institutions, such as the joint associations of various industries and the various trade associations, have been established one after another. Under the leadership of the government, it will inevitably have a new development in implementing the new economic policy. In the midst of the continuous rise in the level of life, people are eager for these institutions to exert their greatest strength to stabilize this chaotic market and contribute to the national economy and the people's livelihood. However, in recent months, prices have soared again and again, more than doubling compared to February and March. Although the reason for this lies in the manipulation and monopoly of unscrupulous merchants, the failure of these institutions to fully exert their abilities is also a major reason. For the current plan, the following points are hoped that the various institutions will quickly find ways to solve them.</p>
<p>1. Establish a Material Evaluation Committee. Each joint association of industries should immediately establish a Material Evaluation Committee to determine the most standard and most up-to-date price for manufacturers' manufacturing costs in the shortest possible time. After being approved by the Business Control Association, it will be implemented, and all members must not change it.</p>
<p>2. Commodity Registration All merchants should register all goods with the trade association, the joint association of industries, and the Business Control Association at the end of each month. Each joint association will stamp a copy of the registration form of each merchant and return it to the original merchant, and hang it in a prominent place. If it has been sold, it should be noted immediately. If customers have any doubts, they can also check their invoices to avoid shop assistants falsely claiming that there are no goods.</p>
<p>3. Ban Brokerage Trading In recent years, a large number of brokers have been involved in the buying and selling of any commodity, manipulating the market. This is also a major reason for the high rise in prices of various commodities. In the future, police officers should be contacted to absolutely ban it. Anyone who is not a member of the trade association will not be allowed to buy or sell.</p>
<p>4. Establish a Controlled Economy Research Association. In the past, there has been very little research on controlled economy. Those in charge feel quite at a loss. I believe that the Business Control Association should preside over the establishment of a Controlled Economy Research Association, and invite knowledgeable domestic and foreign scholars to give systematic lectures regularly in their spare time. On the one hand, they should carry out spiritual training to ensure that Mr. Tang Shoumin's four words of justice and honesty are deeply imprinted in the hearts of every server. First, train the staff of the Business Control Association and the joint associations, and then train the staff of the trade associations to become a trained and organized cadre.</p>
<h3>After Reading the Book "The Right and Wrong of Politics and the Transmission of Public Opinion"</h3>
<p>— Yang Wanli</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Chen Fumu's thesis (see the weekly review of Shenbao on July 18), I couldn't help but feel mixed feelings. Does the government really not want popular support? No, not only does it not want popular support, but it doesn't even want the people. Look, if it wanted the people, why would the level of life be rising so high every day, especially "rice", which is rising very sharply.</p>
<p>Any country that wants to be strong must first win the support of the people, which is called "love what the people love and hate what the people hate." In ancient and modern history, no country has been able to become strong without the support of the people. However, does the government care about the support or opposition of the people? The level of life is rising so high every day, and although the government has issued solemn orders to punish those who are found to be hoarding goods, it is "only hearing the sound of footsteps on the stairs but not seeing anyone coming down".</p>
<p>It is not difficult for the government to win the support of the people: First, politics must not lie. Any order issued by the government, if it is not issued, it is done, and if it is issued, it must be honored, no matter how difficult it is. Empty checks, again and again, again and again, how can the recipients believe them? Second, prices, especially rice, must be leveled down as soon as possible, otherwise "everyone will point fingers at it", and the future is really unimaginable? If the government wants to win the support of the people, it must solve these two problems immediately. After the solution, the people's hearts will naturally submit.</p>
<p>I love China, I love East Asia, and I also love Japan. In order to seek the final victory of the Greater East Asia War, we must win the support of the people. I hope that the government will not just sit and talk but act immediately and solve the people's livelihood problems immediately. I also hope that our friendly country, Japan, will immediately assist our government in solving the most important livelihood problems of the people.</p>

<h3>A Serious Health Problem</h3>
<p>— He Hailin</p>
<p>Since the city trained people for air defense, most of the sidewalks on the roads have been equipped with air defense sand and water tanks. This was originally a good way to prevent problems before they happen and protect safety, but as time has passed, the water in those water tanks has become dirty and smelly. Now, the tanks are full of mosquito larvae. As a result, there are many mosquitoes in the city and the concession this year, sucking people's blood and spreading the terrible virus. This is truly a serious problem that threatens the health of citizens. Please pay attention to the municipal health authorities and the persons in charge of the various baojia offices, and quickly find ways to improve and eliminate it.</p>
<p>Compilation of Righteous Schools</p>
<p>The Wulun Middle School at 597 Chengdu Road offers three free places in the first grade of junior high school in response to the aid-students movement. The examination will be held on August 5, and the newspaper will recommend two students.</p>
<p>The Zhenya Obligatory Night School at 14 Siyuan Village, Huaji Road, will open on August 1. There are still places available for registration.</p>
<p>The Meilan Obligatory Middle School has moved to Huaying Primary School at 958 Lane, intersection of Aiwenyi Road and Dahua Road. It continues to recruit transfer students in the second year of junior high school and new students in the first year. Tuition is free. If the academic performance is excellent, the school can introduce students to employment after graduation.</p>
<h3>Walled Off the Wannan Cemetery</h3>
<p>After the publication of Mr. Baihong's article "Quickly Build a Bamboo Fence for Wannan Cemetery" in this column, the management office of the cemetery sent a letter stating: "Our cemetery has brick walls on the southeast sides. Only the expanded foundation on the northwest sides was temporarily surrounded by bamboo fences before the incident in the 26th year of the Republic of China. After the incident, it was stolen and dismantled every night. It has been repaired many times, and it is impossible to prevent it. It has recently been decided to rebuild it, so there is no need for burial households to make additional donations."</p>
<p>Notes Wang Guan donated 200 yuan for calligraphy and painting, and entrusted us to send it to the Holy Mother's Nursery. Ma Qiang also sent 200 yuan to the family of Cheng KeGuang with a humanitarian perspective. People with disabilities donated 100 yuan to the Fuya School. Thank you for this.</p>
