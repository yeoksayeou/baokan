<p>社評</p>
<h3>嚴重的文化用紙問題</h3>
<p>紙張是保存文化和溝通知識的工具，在人類文明事業上佔極重要的地位。我國又爲紙的發明者，並且是產紙最普遍的國家。可惜幾千年來，澴停滯在手工業的成法中，產量有限，品類不一。最近三四十年來，始有近代化的紙業，但尙在萌芽時代，且印刷上用紙，大部來自外國，據民國二十六年的統計，紙類進口價額共六千五百三十萬零二千元。大東亞戰爭以後，外來紙張遂告絕跡，紙價亦日益飛漲。因此文化用紙，包括新聞紙，公文信件用紙，油印臘紙，複寫紙等，價格之飛騰，實屬驚人。結果對於文化事業之停滯影響，極爲重大。以上海一市而言，本爲全國文化中心，在此非常時期，佔有號召復興文化的重要地位。然一般出版事業，尙陷於停滯狀態，紙張之昂貴，實爲最大原因之一。如果此一因素不早解決，則不僅各大書局難求其恢復出版圖書，即目前各報章雜誌，亦有在不久將來，無法繼續出版之危機，膽念文化前途，實有令人不寒而慄者。更進而硏究上海新聞紙價之飛漲，最不合理，蓋除一小部份爲本地出產者外，大都爲前年十二月八日積存之外國貨，雖就幣値及市况之變動，其價格固應提高；但決不應較前年底飛漲至二十倍以上，以少數人之暴利，而陷出版事業於停滯，誠爲社會公意與國家法令所不許。</p>
<p>爲了維持及發展文化出版事業，我們迫切希望政府當局及文化界協力解決以下幾點：第一，是文化用紙的大量增產。上海原有機器製紙各廠，應增加生產，同時增加手工製紙的產量，並改良其品質。目前政府當首先貸款與製紙業者，獎勵生產，並借重友邦技術人材，協力改進我國造紙事業。第二，爲治標計，對於各紙商，凡在前年十二月八日以前購進之外國新聞紙，立即重行登記，施行限價。對於本地產紙各廠，應估計其成本，施仃限價。同時，嚴禁非紙商囤積居奇。第三，是立即實行管制消費，合理分配，一方面對於迷信用紙限制消耗，一方面對於不必要的商業傳單娛樂廣吿等，應予以合理的限制。此外公文信函，以及商店用紙，都應節的。然後對於報紙，雜誌，圖書出版界實行合理分配，給予獲得用紙的充分保障。那麼文化出版事業才有合理開展的希望。甚願政府當局與文化界共同協力，以維護我國文化出版事業之進步</p>

<h3>歐洲新秩序的憲章</h3>
<p>據柏林電訊，軸心國首腦者間，疋在討論歐洲新秩序的成案，關於此問題，最近將發表正式聲明，由三月一日所發表的官報中，可以看出這問題爲上月二十四日起德義首腦者在羅馬會談五日重要議題之一。軸心國歐洲新秩序的具體計劃的發表，將使德義的旗幟更爲鮮明，敵國的宣傳無措詞的餘地，而歐洲諸國則更將各安其堵，祈求軸心方面的勝利，此在促進歐洲諸國的共同協力上，不能不說是機宜之策。</p>
<p>上述羅馬會談後所發表的官報聲稱，歐洲協同體內的各國民衆，在其被保護的國境區域內，從事生產的勞慟，則能得到享受社會的正義的保障。又在本月十三日，德國宣傳部創立十週年的紀念日，戈培爾博士答覆外國記者團的質問稱：軸心國範圍下的歐洲新秩序，各國均能保持其各自的獨立性，在政治，經濟，外交及文化各部門一致協力，什麼德國用武力統一歐洲，强制各國採取德國國家社會主義等，顯然都是不確的。戈培爾又稱：「在戰時中，德國民衆自身受到自由的限制，在非常嚴厲的規律下，爲完成戰時目的而勞動，同樣，對於德軍占領下的各國並其他歐洲各國的民衆，爲遂行戰爭而採取各種必要的强制手段，實在是不得已的」。要之，德義政府的企圖，在排除共產王義，猶太勢力及令權主義的的制下，盡量尊重各國的獨立自治。</p>
<p>當然，從前以德義爲中心的歐洲新秩序的概念，傳說紛紜，德義與歐洲各國之實際的關係，在過去常不免有被誤解的遺憾。抑就新秩序的理想之本身而言，尊重各國的民意，在原則上是必要的。更就時機的一點說來，德義政府在此時爲把握各國的民意而袪除其原有的誤解，使各國民衆洞悉德義的眞意，不能不說是賢明的舉措，如英國政府，一向注重利已主義，而採取援護中小國的政策，乃於一九三九年八月與波蘭締結互助條約。但至今日，爲取媚蘇聯，竟拋棄東歐諸國，一任蘇聯政府自由處理。英國在今日固然沒有保障歐洲大陸諸國的資格，在將來更沒有置喙的餘地。英美爲了自己的打算，把歐洲大陸的安全，各國民衆的福利，毫不躊躇的供其犧牲。反之，歐洲新秩序之核心的德義，對外，爲了保護歐洲大陸而增强其大量，對內，則堅固其精神的團結。德義費了很大的工夫建設歐洲的新秩序，其前途的開展，可拭目以待。（翔：譯自三月二十日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>日越協力益緊密　重慶活躍完全失敗</h3>
<p>（西貢松永特派員十五日發）一法屬越南的殖民地軍，在不遠的將來，將以渝軍爲敵而與之交戰。」這不是在越南的記者的夢囈，上月二十三日維希政府聲明撤廢在華治外法權與交還租界的宣　，即係吾認蔣政權的意義。重慶方面駐維希的代理大使，已經撤退至里期本，而駐重慶的法國外交官傳說被軟禁於某地，法國與重慶的外交關係等於是已經斷絕了。重慶，昆明以至中國內地，尙住有法國僑民數百名，而目援蔣路綫的滇越鐵道，係中法合辦，以海防爲起點，經河內，老開而至昆明，這些善後措置決定之日，亦即將爲重慶與維希互相聲明斷終國交之日。在第二次歐洲大戰序幕中一敗塗地的法國，此後的動向，極複雜微妙之能事。戰敗國所應有的苦惱，極爲深刻。法屬越南速離祖國數千里，捲入大東亞戰爭的漩渦中，而孤立於大東亞的一角，其前途決不是康莊的大道。</p>
<p>記者自去年六月以來，即駐在越南，注視軍事，政治，經濟，文化各部面的動盪，殘存着一抹陰影的越南的表情，適應國際情勢的推移，敏銳地改變其所取的態度，特古總督及其殖民地的首腦部，在此時期，對時局的認識極爲正確，因而其舉措也並沒有錯誤。去年十一月英美軍侵略法屬北非的不法行動，決定了法國本國所應走的途徑，此次與重慶政權的脫幅，更展開了値得注視的新局面。法屬越南因與雲南，廣西二省的國境相接，故可以說已經到達決定其命運的階段了。記者對其動盪有切身的體騐，感覺到現在正是赤裸裸地述說法屬越南眞相的機會，乃有本篇現地報吿的寫作。</p>
<p>一九四一年七月，日法兩國間所締結的關於日越共同防衛的協定，乃是日軍所取的軍事同時又是經濟的協定。越南軍的每一個將士，其精神的內容極爲貧乏。英美之傀儡的渝軍，雖然是日軍的仇敵，但防守中越國境的越南軍之一部，却並不以爲是應與日軍共同加以擊滅的仇敵。在緊張的國境，竟有這樣奇怪的現象。</p>
<p>去年十一月，現者　視察初冬的越南，中國國境最前綫的景况，離開渝軍的要塞祇有三百公尺的距離，記者從　雲南軍對峙中的靑年將　口中，直接聽到下列一段挿話，茲介紹於下：</p>
<p>某日，某日軍將較正在巡視國境警備　的時候，從中國國境那面走出一個法國將校，訊問時，答稱是在偵察敵情。事實上該法國將校係在警備國境的渝軍營中會食而歸。當即加以斥責，他振振有辭地辯稱：「給與渝軍的　西是織物，鹽，與砂糖，而帶回給日軍的禮物是雲南軍的配備與動向，決不是出賣日軍的情報。」與日軍共同防守殖民地的越南軍之一部，當時就常常瞞過日軍的眼，越過國境而與渝軍互相往來。那時候曾有法國將校二三人因不慊於最高首腦部的親日政策而往投渝軍。</p>
<p>聳立於期遜附近一帶高地的越南馬奇諾防綫的法軍要塞，其建築費共二千萬越元。該地一旦發生戰事，巨砲的咆哮，是否一齊向着重慶方面轟擊嗎？</p>
<p>然而以法國本國爲中心的世界情勢，業已起了急激的變化，法國與英美的國交固已斷絕，近又與重慶絕緣了。這在日法越的親善上是値得欣喜的一件事，某將軍視察防守國境的日法兩軍後，說：</p>
<p>現在國境的警備是完善了。法越軍與日軍合力而起時，渝軍將不能越國境一步。嚮導的法軍部隊長，詳細地領導視察城塞的內部，送來了軍用秘密地圖。</p>
<p>最近法越軍的態度，完全開誠佈公，對日軍有深切的信賴，日法越軍事協定，今已名實俱符，合作無間。</p>
<p>大東亞戰勃發的前後，散在於馬來及其他共榮圈各地的特戈爾份子，逃避戰塵於越南，在西貢之南的三百公里的越南南部唯一的高原避暑地達拉特，是他們的述逃藪。藉無綫電與同志間秘密連絡，醞釀親英美的空氣。現在他們的暗中活躍，在日越當局的嚴重監視之下，幾已停止了。在南部的敍倫，爲援蔣華僑的集中地，在大東亞戰爭前，與西貢同以雅片及賭博著稱，而爲國際情報活躍的舞台。</p>
<p>越南南部產米三千數百萬石，大半被掌握於以商館爲中心的二十五萬華僑的手中，敍倫因此而形成完全的中國都市，最近該地大事檢舉共產黨員，取締援蔣雖僑，在去年末之前，天空滿佈重慶方面的天綫，秘密情報的　鍵，極見繁忙。</p>
<p>重慶方面的間諜，潛入越南境內，晤中甚爲活躍，潛跡於越南境內特戈爾份子，援蔣華僑，共產份子，經日越當局屢加彈壓，全被淸除，越南的治安，今已高枕無憂。</p>
<p>自一九四〇年進駐北　，一九四一年進駐南　，以迄大東亞戰爭的現階段，越南作爲兵站基地而所盡之軍事的經濟的任務，不能不予以正當的評價。日越共同防衛，經濟協定二重細帶所連結之的束，日見强禦，上月二十一日經法國的諒解，日本海陸軍進駐廣州灣法國租借地，上月二十三日，維希政府聲明撤慶在華治外法權，交還租界，及本月五日發表的日越經濟協定的强化等，足爲明證。這對日依存協力的態度，亦可見之於日本代表部與特古總督，瑪爾頓經濟局長折衝的經過，越南銀行總理伽納率直地披陳說。</p>
<p>越南目前的貿易，產業，金融等種種，脫離原來的依存法國，今爲共榮圈的一員，而依存於日本。</p>
<p>對日輸出的米，玉蜀黍等農產物，舉全力與日本合作，表示越南的誠意。最近的事例，如限制自己的需要，而約定供給日鉅量的木材及水泥。日本則竭力幫助越南制壓因物資缺乏發生的通貨膨脹的傾向。</p>
<p>法國的接近軸心國，最近愈見顯著，大東亞相靑本前在議會答覆某議員的質問稱：</p>
<p>「越南現在完全諒解日本的信賴，在政治經濟各方面與日本積極的合作，共同防衛的實現，是越南所應進取的唯一路徑，越南對此已有深切的自覺」。</p>
<p>大東亞相的這言論，當地日本人士咸予承認。法國所有的殖民地，都被英美所蹂躪，啡印度支那半島爲法國所保持的最後殖民地，故唯有依存以維持其存在，別無他法。居住越南的法國人的有四萬，在三色旗之下高唱國歌，他們是最幸福的人們。在趣南的法人之中，亦有深信英美將護得最後的勝利者；但日軍之驚異的進擊，粉碎了這希望的觀測。法國本國最近的慘淡表情，當然，因爲瞭悉各殖民地的現狀後所致。越南方面，若能够瞭解日本的誠意，則自然可以明白越南所應走的路徑。越南以豐富的資源爲背景，應跨上新的確固的巨步。（翔：譯自三月十七日西部朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>東京製索廠參觀記</h3>
<p>一條完全沒有接縫而長達四千至五千公尺的鋼絲，其粒度，脫碳，組織，粗度，表面，抗張力，伸展，搓撚，屈曲，硏磨等等，無論在那一點上，不能有一點點的毛病。諸君當還記得以前曾鏗有過昇降機啦，鐵索車啦的慘事吧。</p>
<p>爲要强化一條鋼絲，先要把鋼絲燒軟，施以酸洗，用石灰中和，使之乾燥，然後把它在抽絲機的孔裏通過許多許多决，做成細而且强的鋼絲。大凡要把直徑的三分粗的鋼條，弄成彷彿像頭髮一樣細，須經過三十次以上的工程。但在此等工程之中，却要用到很多的肥皂，把鋼絲弄得非常光滑。這個工廠裏除了有着各種各樣的機器外，還有着鐵，煤，硫酸，石灰，，肥皂，特殊鋼，麻等，種種重要的材料。</p>
<p>把這種做得很完全的鋼絲，用麻絲做芯，撚成種種形狀，便成鋼索。現代戰爭中把鋼索的重要性，較不重視，實是遺憾。這裏限於篇幅，不能把它在戰爭中的重要用途，詳細開列，總而言之，要是沒有鋼索，則海上的飛機，陸上的飛機，就不能駕駛；氣球，機雷，便不能繫住；掃海班就要失掉其任務；無論是艦艇，是一般的船舶，都要發生重大的障礙；不但如此，要在海裏設置防潛網，亦不可能，而艦艇也無法防備機雷了。換句話說，要是沒有鋼索，那末，艦艇，大砲，戰車，都不能生產。後方國民的生產陣中，用以搬運煤，鐵，銅，其他重要礦石，木材等之曳索，平衡索，捲提索，　道等，要是沒有鋼索，就不堪設想。</p>
<p>在現今的決戰態勢之下，担當着道個重要仟務的東京製索廠，是明治廿五年（公元一八九二年）二月一日，澁澤榮一翁，山田正邦氏等所創設，最初以製麻尼拉麻繩爲主，明治三十三年以後，逐漸轉向製造鋼索的一途。該廠旣有着這樣古老的傳統，故其職員及工人的在職年限，平均爲十五年，而已經在該廠　續服務達三四十年者，比比皆是，並不稀奇。像現在任倉庫員之職的池田大决郞氏（現年七十四歲），在該廠已有五十二年的歷史，去年底還在廠裏熱心工作。這個池田氏在米價每升六分錢的時代開始進廠工作，當時每天的工錢是一角六分，他原是一個參加過中日戰爭和日俄戰爭兩役的勇士。在這裏不管是老前輩工員，不管是新時代工員，都是互相以愛國的至情結合着的，個個從內心裏表示出協力生產的至誠。</p>
<p>「我們的生產對於第一綫果眞有什麼貢獻嗎！不至於談不上貢獻嗎？」</p>
<p>這樣的眞摯的關心，把全廠〇〇人的心，結合爲一，一切的行動，都可用「爲了勝利」一語來包括，舉凡一舉手一投足，無不向着這唯一的目的而集中，總之，這憂的員工全體，是以這樣的果敢精神勇躍邁進着的。</p>
<p>不過就這個工廠的性格而言，這裏却有一個使人掛慮的地方，是不能等閒看過的。如果是製造砲彈或製造槍彈的員工，那末這砲彈是用以去殲滅鬼畜英美的，這槍彈是用以打穿不服從者的胸膛的，這種意識表現得很濃厚，而在工作上，也表示着不下於第一綫將士那樣的熱奮的精神；可是一條鋼絲和大東亞戰爭之有直接關係的問題，對於這輩老實的年輕工員，却有點難以瞭解吧。不，難於瞭解是當然的，而且不用說，關於此點，防諜問題也非加以考慮不可；然而使其完全理解部分和全體的關係於增强生產。却是最緊要的。因此我相信惟有鼓舞年輕人的感激性，是增强生產的第一步。非把他們的製品和第一錢將士的關係，對他們詳細說明，把他們的製品之重要用途，於可能範圍內，使之充分理解不可。比方說，在A工廠裏製造的駕駛索，因爲來不及趕成的緣故，就使別處B工廠裏已經裝好骨架的飛機二十架或三十架，不能動手裝配機體，而只好讓工人空手閒着，這就是件不可輕視的大事。對於富於感激性的年輕工昌們，必須用淺顯而誠懇的話，把「一條鋼絲和飛機的製造順序及飛行士的活躍」三者聯繫起來，切實說明而使之理解，由此使他們由衷奮潑，如此，則對於增强生產，恐怕效果必在想像之上吧。對他們稱之爲實業戰士，譽之爲後方第一綫勇士，這種空洞好聽的話，他們未必要聽，他們倒願意多聽一些他們所製造之部分的製品對於戰局全體有着怎麼樣的關係。惟有使他們有這種認識，方是擴充生產的正道，方是擴充生產的根本要義。我知道他們有道種眞摯而健全的要求，所以我感覺到今後的增强生產，是很有希望的。這並不是我對於工廠方面而說的話，乃是向着當局而說的由衷之話。</p>
<p>我和該廠職工諸君，曾舉行二次座談會，聽到了許多美談。不過這裏所謂美談，決不能作爲美談夾看待，而是平凡的事情。煤氣班在元旦那一天沒有休息，他們就把那大所得的工錢，自動捐獻給國家了。</p>
<p>「放假天工作，那天的工錢是不應該支取的。」</p>
<p>這是他們老實的主張，不工作而貪得工錢的人們，聽了這話眞應該愧死吧。</p>
<p>製絲部某工員的兄因戰傷在療養中陷於危篤而歿，其出寄了一封信給該工員，裏面這樣寫着：</p>
<p>「汝兄爲國而戰，武運蹉跎以致捐軀。汝現爲服務於國之身，不能因兄喪而怠其一日職務。休息之日不妨外出時，可來一拜兄墓也。」</p>
<p>幼時嘗讀一水兵之母一而爲之感激淚下，然而這封信所表示的日本母範的精神，其壯烈實不亞於那本書。這個工廠裏現在有山形縣的動勞報國隊女性〇〇名，正在某重要部分服勞。這輩雪國女性，個個都是多麼樸實而且眞摯，認眞地工作着，看了使人低頭贊嘆。其中也有數名女　校出身的女性。她們是趁着冬季的農閒期而到軍需工廠裏來，等到水土回暖時，再返故鄉執着鍬鋤去從事食糧增產。我以爲在這輩女性中，像剛纔那個工員母親那樣的女性，一定是在成長着的。</p>
<p>我在這個工廠裏參觀後，當晚就在該廠的宿舍裏過了一夜，翌晨又去參觀該廠所屬廣達二卞坪（譯者註：一坪即方六尺之謂）的農塲。一切都是規則整齊而合於軍隊式的，宿舍淸潔，膳食富於營養，厚生福利的設施，也很完備。</p>
<p>工員們在進餐之前，必定先要作這樣的反省辭：</p>
<p>「德行不足的我們，享受這樣的食物，殊感慚愧，無論何時何地，我們決不抱不平不滿之心。」</p>
<p>我聽了這種反省辭之後，自已也不禁深自反省起來了。（櫻田常久原著—丁：譯自三月十八日讀資報知）</p>

<h3>日陸軍報道部發言人　報道緬甸狀况　並介紹金華復興狀况</h3>
<p>日本在上海陸軍部報道部於昨（廿五）日下午三時、循例舉行招待本市中國新聞記者團、由報道部發言人介紹方由浙東金華來滬之日軍部隊慕僚、即席對金華目前復興情形、闡述頗詳、繼由發言人報道最近緬甸情况、直至下十五時後始畢、</p>
<p>金華建設一般　據稱、金華方面之復與、正努力建設中、尤以交通要道、如橋樑等已次第恢復、如金華之」通濟橋及「玉龍橋」、前因受戰事損毀、人民交通不便、經日軍暨當地民衆協力建修、得吿完竣、此外如「萬佛塔」一座、現正積極修造中、繼對萬佛塔作簡單說明、按該塔計有十二級、被砲火破壞過甚、日方於佔領金華後、因該塔具有悠久歷史、爲保存中國文化古蹟、當努力修飾、以期恢復舊觀、次述金華爲浙江財閥之發源地、在中國財政經濟上具有龐大勢力、日軍進駐後、努力補充物資、目前關於娛樂方面、已開設戲院三所、敎育方而已設立者有小學十五所、初級中學一所、尙有高級女子中學一所、正在籌備中、不久可望開學、學生對國府參戰後與友邦同生共死之精神、普遍瞭解、目對擊滅束亞公敵之英美、亦有深切認識、民衆學生已相當認識國父大亞洲主義之眞諦、</p>
<p>緬甸軍事情形旋由軍部發言人對緬甸作戰狀况詳述如下、最近英美渝協的國、以克復緬甸爲主要目標、渝方對滇緬路準備發動攻勢、特派陳誠擔任遠征軍總司令、陳誠前任之第六戰區長官職務、今另委孫連仲擔任、目前陳誠駐軍在雲南西部、至在印英軍、亦準備由印發動、綜合而觀、目前渝軍尙無單獨對緬發動攻勢之可能、僅保本身防地以禦日軍作進一步之攻勢耳、觀察雲南現勢、陳誠雖駐軍滇西、滇東仍爲龍雲勢力、陳誠軍力今有二十四師及七旅、編爲十一集團軍、此外則爲第五集團軍、由前在緬甸作戰之第五軍長杜聿明統率、其下爲第七十一軍（宋希濂任軍長）（下設四師新編一師）、第六軍（下設三師）、第五軍（下設三師）、第二軍（下設三師）、及第八軍（下設三師）等所組織、第十一集團軍所屬第七十一軍現駐雲南大理、第五集團軍所屬第六軍駐雲南以啣接緬甸國境地帶、至第五集團軍之中力、則在昆明、一部份軍力在大理之東北部、餘爲所屬第二軍、由貴陽移駐鳳儀、所屬第八軍、由常德移駐昆明、至目前在渝之美空軍、僅的九十架而已、</p>
<p>印緬最近軍情關於緬印大槪情形、在印之陸軍爲英所主持、空軍由美主持、自去年二月中英軍撤退日溪、經日軍有力部隊猛擊、損失慘重、敵並因受犬時地理所阻、接濟困難、以是對緬甸路之奪回、益見焦躁不安、日軍爲防制英美兮後有所蠢動、在三月上旬開始大規模攻勢、敵方狼狽大敗、嗣後敵方以陸軍受阻、乃以空軍作反攻之舉、故在二月上句、敵方空襲數量達八十七次之多、前後出動飛機數量併合共計四百五十一架、此項空襲地點、均在前綫不一定之處、由此益足證明英美渝政奪緬甸經日軍嚴加打擊後已成幻想、預料今後將有大規模之游擊戰展開、最後並述及印軍不願協助英美作戰、而印民衆則對日軍全面効勞、於此已證明日軍居於絕對優勢、在印敵軍現有華維爾所屬十師兩旅、空軍擁機四百餘架、由美食責、至於渝方在印之遠征軍、共十七師、亦由陳誠擔任司令、末並指斥何應欽視察印度之報吿、悉爲吹噓之詞、</p>

<p>據調查：國府各機關在上海所設的辦事處，有四十餘處，假使再把和平軍或特務工作關係的駐滬機關併計起來，數景更將驚人。</p>
<p>連日本方面包括在內，所謂濫設機關與種類複雜，不論上海或內地，向來被人目爲是個問題。可是日本方面，自設置大東亞省，及適應國府參戰後的新事態而實踐新政策，對於平素爲一般人批評的機構，處處加以改善。中國方面是怎樣呢？因爲這是中國的內政，我們未便置評，祇能就協力者的地位來希望，要是把我們的希望率直的說，那末統合整理中央，地方的行政機構，是當前的切實需求，尤其是上海更有必要。</p>
<p>公共租界的收回在什麼時候？用何種形式來實行？這事不能預測，遲早固然不得而知，但是不久的將來，必然可以見諸實現。這點祇要一讀重光大使的談話，自會明白的。而一旦收回之後，新的市政形態，敢斷言必需要把複雜無章的上海行政機構改爲簡單化。我們深信此舉的必要，更抱着萬分的期待。</p>
<p>我想負責收回租界的國民政府或上海特別市政府，恐怕已在準備一切收回步驟，可是其中駐滬辦事處的問題，不曉</p>
<h3>譯評　駐滬辦事處的調整</h3>
<p>得作何考慮，我們衷心希望國民政府對於這個問題，予以英斷善處。駐滬辦事處的合併改廢，和收回租界是個別問題，總之爲求加强上海特別市政府，推進京滬一體的關係，上述的希望，不用明言，自可會意的。（雲鵬：譯自三月二十五日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>短評　歡迎高島總裁</h3>
<p>繼兒玉謙次氏爲華中振興公司總裁之高島菊次郞氏，已於昨日自東京平安抵滬，吾人於敬致歡迎之餘，提出願望數事：</p>
<p>華中振興公司，係華中經濟之最大機構，其附屬事業，包括礦業，工業，交通運輸，通信，公用等，共有十六單位。經營管理之得失，影響於國計民生，尤其總力參戰者，至深且巨。本於日新又新之義，檢討過去，以籌策盡善盡美之營運方策，實爲今後首應注意者一。</p>
<p>華中振興公司過去之任務，着重於復興戰後瘡痍之華中產業，慘淡經營，奠立始基，厥功殊偉。而自大東亞戰爭勃發以至國府參戰後之今日，更需要資源之開發，交通運輸之暢通，今後公司之使命，將由復興戰後產業，進而加速發展產業，適應戰時需姿，以期直接貢獻於總力戰爭，此其二。</p>
<p>我人屢次主張，今後辦理中國經濟事業，期收最高效率，應遵守下列原則：（一）中國自辦較日本辦理爲有利者，交還中國辦理；（二）中日雙方合辦爲有利者，中日合辦；（三）日本辦理較中國自辦爲有利者，仍由日本辦理。基於上述原則而決定辦理之事業，其主要負責人選，允須絕對採取人材主義，此其三。</p>
<p>高島氏昨日招待記者席上，即言一中日兩國之提携，不僅在口頭或紙上，並須在實際方面表現出來，俾兩國國民日常生活行爲上結合起來……願全力促其成。」更與我人向來主張兩國眞正親善，須植基於國民情感上，亦即國民日常生活行爲上，所見正同。尤盼高島先生全力促成，此其四。</p>
<p>高島先生爲日本最有聲望之企業家，識騐豐富，出任總裁，游刃有餘，吾人對於華中振興公司今後之業績，願拭目以觀。</p>

<p>華中振興股份有限公司新任總裁高島菊次郞、業已階同副總裁植塲。秘書浜田。由東京來滬、幷於昨（二十五）日下午六時、在百老滙大厦招待日本新聞界、六時半招待本市中國新聞界、闡明今後經營之力針云、「常茲中日兩國之關係回復到應有之狀態、而向新的正軌途上努力邁進的時候、鄙人承接先輩兒玉先生之後塵、就任華中振興股份有限公司總裁之要職、泃覺光榮、自維菲力、勢難克此重任、今後惟有勉盡全力、體奉政府之方針、以期完成職責與使命、至於中日兩國之提携、日本政府夙所聲明、最近東條首相訪問國民政府、而汪主席亦有同樣之聲明、鄙人本無贅言之必要、惟有遵打兩國政府之新方針、使中日兩國之提携、不僅在口頭或紙上、並須在其實際方面表現出來、俾得兩國國民之日常生沽行爲上結合起來、以互相深厚信頓的關係、作成永遠提携的基礎、竊雖不敏、願竭全力以促其成、至本公司今後之經營、亦當體承政府對華政策的要旨、極力尊重華方之資任與　創意、於必要時、更須將有關公司之事業加以適當的調整、俟在此地詳細視察後、再圖適應實情而善處之、因此、深望此間陸海軍與官民諸位的指導、同時切望國民政府當局賜予協力、而利進行曷勝懇盼」</p>

<h3>經濟界</h3>
<p>軍票略軟　自日大藏省發表四月份起廢止軍票新發行，各種公私支付概用儲券後，用途不免减少，同業互做係稍低爲五元五角五分三四厘。</p>
<p>聯銀券漲風突起　已衝出四元大關外，自軍票停止新發行後，需用較廣，經營者收進由三元九角半升至四元一角，售出須四元二，軋升三角八分。</p>
<h3>評言　中儲券初步的强化</h3>
<p>前日本欄許言，即以如何强化中儲券的購買力爲討論中心，以加强大衆對於中儲券的心理信仰爲決定要素，而昨日消息傳來，友邦已決定於四月一日起，廢止軍票的新發行，由此華中華南通貨，已臻完全一致的狀况，換一句話說，中儲券的統一性能，益復肯定；對於金融之穩定，物價之抑平，自有莫大的關係。這樣一個措施可以說是中儲券初步的强化。</p>
<p>何以說是初步的强化？因爲決定一個國家通貨力量的要素中，至少有兩個要素是必不可少的，一個是通貨的流通性，一個是通貨的發行額。前日評言已經說過，强化中儲券購買力的具體方案，有一基本原則，不可忽略，即大衆對於中儲券之心理信仰，必須使之安定與鞏固。通貨的流通能够一致，民衆對於通貨動盪性的疑慮，自可消弭；通貨的發行額有所限制，民衆對於通貨膨脹性的疑慮，自可掃除。結果，民衆對於通貨的心理信仰，自會加强。</p>
<p>軍票旣已停止發行新鈔，而四月一日以後，所有國庫支出，凡屬軍票者，均將一律改用中儲券；各地銀錢美公會對各同業之存款假款滙兌之支付，亦不能再用軍票。是中儲券的流通性，已能趨於普遍。所以說是中儲券初步的强化。至於進一步的强化——就是發行額的限制——，至少希望財政當局能够不斷地給予民衆以公開的並且事實的報吿，這是定爲民衆所最樂的聞。</p>
<h3>軍票停止發行新鈔後　田尻公使發表談話</h3>
<p>央社滬訊　華中華南方面自四月一日起停止新發行軍票業於二十四日經日本陸海軍大使館當局，及大東亞大臣大藏省當局發表聲明，加以闡明，然尙有一部份民衆對於此次措置之意義，尙未充分理解，誤認軍票停止新發行後，儲備券之發行額，即將增大，或將引起儲備券之通貨膨脹而抱杞憂，日大使館上海事務所田尻公使有鑒於此，特於二十五日發表談話，以爲以上純屬誤解，中日兩當局對於維持儲備券價信，決將採用萬全措置，懇切說明儲備券絕無發生通貨膨脹之慮，茲誌田尻公使談話內容如次：</p>
<p>自四月一日以降，停止新發行軍票，業經二十四日日方當局正式發表該項停止新發行軍票之目的，乃在完成以中央儲備銀行券統一華中華南之通貨工作，向來爲維持軍票價　而採取之各種工作，例如日本及華北滿洲方面輸入品之憑軍票出售，以及當地製品如烟草等之憑軍票出售等措置，今後一律限憑儲備券出售，以維持儲備券價値，日方今後對於維持儲備價　儘量採取應有措置，以舉全力協助國府　進通貨工作爲方針，因軍票停止新發行，今後日本軍部官廳之支付，以及銀行存放款之支付，一律採用儲備券，不再使用軍票，軍票將逐漸收回，而代替軍票地位之儲備券，其流通範圍即將擴大。</p>
<p>儲備券自代替一向流通軍票後其流通範圍雖見擴大，流通額雖有增加，然此僅爲代替以往所流通之軍票，故華中華南通貨總額並無增加，且如頃間所述，日方向來爲維持軍票價値而採取之各種工作，今後將一律用以維持儲備劵價値，且關於維持儲備券價値，日方當儘力採取應有措置，較前更將努力以協力國民政府之通貨政策。因之自停止新發行軍票後，儲備券之流通量即有增加，此乃　儲備劵流通範圍擴大所致，且亦爲儲備券統一華中華南通貨完成之表示，故今後儲備券已成爲統一通貨，其價値益臻安定，此觀於以上各點即可瞭然，儲備劵茲已爲華中華南之統一通貨，華中華南民生之安定與財產之保全，均繁於儲備券價値之安定，故日方業經再三聲明，關於安定通貨價値決與國府協力並採取較以往維持軍票價値尤爲努力之　置以儘量協力爲方針。</p>
<p>儲備券對軍票之比率，向規定爲十八元，自去年六　以來，始吿堅定，自四月一日以降，儲備券與日本圓之比率亦定爲日本圓十八圓對儲備券百元，業經日本大東亞大臣大藏省以及在華陸海軍大使館先後聲明，又國府財政部長周佛海氏亦聲明堅持十八圓行市，故儲備券今後無論對軍票或日本圓，俱同樣定爲十八圓，其堅持方針業經中日兩當局分別閘明，故儲　券之價値行將益臻安定。</p>
<h3>市經濟局調整　本市經濟機構</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　上海特別市經濟局爲遵照本年二月十三日國府頒布之戰時經濟政策綱領規定，決對於本市各種舊有經濟機構之不適合戰時經濟體制者，一律重行予以調整及改組。茲聞該局以本市工商團體爲經濟機構之一種，爲謀積極調整本市經濟機構起見，對於以前未經呈奉核准之本市各業聯合會營業所同業公會及其他類似之組織，統限於四月十日前呈報該局，以憑核辦，希望本市各工商團體一致遵行，切勿延誤云。</p>
<h3>物資移動圓活　轉口稅收入將增</h3>
<p>全國商業統制總會成立後，規定棉紗布等十二類搬出及米穀小麥等搬入必須領得許可證，至於未指定許可制之貨物准予在和平區域內自由運輸，因此滬市各業頗見活躍，因此江海關各分卞所收之轉口稅，甚見增加。考其原因，當係全國商業統制總會成立，物資移動圓活，依此趨向，今後轉口稅收入更可增加，而前之物資偏在傾向亦可緩和。查徵收轉口稅之機關，爲各海關及其分卡，截至三月二十日止，計有二十四處。</p>
<h3>華中煙草配給　昨起實行派貨　憑卡領取明日爲止</h3>
<p>華中烟草配給組合呈請當局公佈捲烟公允價格後，關於統一配給，業已準備就緒，於昨日起實施首期派貨，所派之貨，暫以軍管理願中烟公司及日商中華烟公司所出品各貨爲限，其配給辦法採取一，二，三，四制度，依照各經售捲烟行號之ABCD四等級爲標準，（例如A派烟四包，B派烟三包，C派烟二包，D派烟一包）。憑事前所發給之派貨卡領取。（一）三百家大同行，向指定之配給所領派。（二）五千餘家小同行，向指定之大同行領派，限三月二十七日爲止，至於華成，南洋，大東，福新，大東南等華廠派貨，因手續關係，須至三月二十九日（星期一）實行。關於切實執行捲烟限價問題，已由當局負責辦理，違者決予重辦，所以昨日起各捲烟商店已遵照限價發售，惟限制購買數量，以一二小包爲限云。</p>
<h3>譯論　通貨政策的新發展</h3>
<p>關於中儲券的流通及强化，日本方面向來是積極協力的，其流通區日益擴大，幣値也極安定，這次日本當局又決定停止發行軍票新鈔，中儲券就成了華中華南的唯一通貨，它的地位是愈加重大。</p>
<p>停止發行軍票新鈔，旨在漸次造成中儲　單一幣制的政策，對於經濟界沒有什麼變動，經濟的運用仍舊可以順利。在短期內必能統一幣制，今後軍政當局不再以軍票支付，一切存款、滙兌都用中儲券進出，當局的施策，既適當而又週　，這是不用說得的。</p>
<p>在過去五年中，軍票已完成重大任務。與舊法幣鬥爭的通貨戰，以及協助中儲奉流通的工作，都完成了不可磨滅的功績，目下已經任務完畢，到達了統一幣制的時期，但是我們還須要官民合作，盡最善的努力，使軍票有始有終，達到成功引退的階段。（雲鵬：譯自三月廿五日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>蘇浙兩省產米　糧部在蘇設產銷處</h3>

<p>調查去年糧產　糧食部成立後，爲明瞭去年度所屬各省市縣之食米麵粉以及雜糧等全年產銷數量情况，用備查考起見，爰特通令各省市糧政機關，即行詳密具報，市糧食管理局，奉令後，即行轉飭所屬各區，切實具報。</p>
<h3>中國商業銀行之今昔觀（一）</h3>
<p>— 兼之</p>
<p>「金融爲百業之樞紐」，此不特久爲社會一般之口頭禪，且亦爲公認之經濟事實。在人民心目中，經濟之安定，無異即爲金　之安定，兩者名異而實同。在中國政府向來亦認爲安定金融，即可安定經濟，一切經濟之措施，當先從金屬着手。金融在經濟上之被重視旣如此，則金融中最重要機構之銀行，其被視爲百業之樞紐，實亦當然矣！</p>
<p>在中國經濟史上，銀行確曾爲經濟之樞紐，且其勢力不僅左右經濟之活動，並爲政治勢力之骨幹。在「八一三」前，尤以法幣政業未實行前爲甚，中國商業銀行在經濟界中爲擁有最大之資金者，亦爲一般社會儲蓄之唯一信託人。該時工商事業，其資金在數十萬元以上者，已爲極大之企業；而較大之商業銀行，則已有千萬元以上之存款，因資力之懸殊，在當時社會對投資無直接興趣情况之下，終是工商事業，乃不得不依賴銀行爲週轉，銀行乃得利用金融之勢力，操縱經濟。</p>
<p>不僅此也，民國以來之政府、財政困難常小得不以舉債爲理財之小二法門。銀行爲鉅額資金之擁有者，乃成爲當然之債權人。一般政治家與銀行家互爲奥援，活躍於政治舞臺，於是銀行與政治，乃發生密切之關係，此爲中國商業銀行之黃金時代。自國民政府成立以後，情况稍變：但在經濟方面，仍不斷需要銀行之協助，故其勢力雖减，但仍在　存如昔」。</p>

<h3>懼怕與人生</h3>
<p>— 小麟</p>
<p>「懼怕」對於「人生」在有益方面看來，是人生進步不可少的一服心理藥劑，誰懼怕法律的刑罰，就會避免去犯罪。誰懼怕肚子的饑餓，就會去努力工作，誰懼怕生病，就得好好地看重身體注重衛生。誰懼怕別人的恥笑，就會努力上進替自己掙一口氣……。這種懼怕都是人生需要的。</p>
<p>但在另一方面看來，許多人的失敗也是由於懼怕一切的緣故，而對於任何事業都因了懼怕而裹足不前，毀滅人生一切的自信心，熱忱，創迭力，決斷力。「懼怕」使他感覺到週圍的人都在尋找自己的缺點來責難，「懼怕」使他感覺到所有的事都充實着人力不能解除的艱難。這樣下去，懼怕便永遠操縱了他的意志，使他永遠得不到平衡，一直到「死」他還懼怕着「死」會使他受到痛苦。</p>
<p>多麼可惜，多少人就被懼怕活埋了。</p>
<p>懼怕大都由於自己個人的思慮所擴展而成的。他們把敵人關閉在自己的心裏，讓它自由自在地作祟。</p>
<p>要醫治這種心理上的毛病，只有自己的智慧方是最好的藥品，只有淸楚的智慧可以把心中的懼怕驅除，把懼怕的頭腦洗滌淸醒。防止懼怕的作祟只有直接行動，忘却懼怕，令你的精神不爲環境所糾纏，「鎭靜」地自由地從事創造的努力，不必懼怕失敗，要緊的還是努力校正缺點。</p>
<p>征服懼怕方能踏上成功之途，如果讓懼怕在人生中生長，那無異是慢性的自殺。</p>
<h3>雨天</h3>
<p>— 亞祺</p>
<p>街上落着雨，雨並不大，僅只落濕了街心，也有幾點落在窗簾上；輕微的聲響並不驚動我，我覺得雨早該下了，可愛的雨，春天了，幾滴的雨珠，可灌溉將發芽的新葉，可滋潤人們渡過嚴冬的心肺，牠！淫淫的細雨。</p>
<p>在四川的時候，我住在蓉域有兩年，，那地方雖然不及江南的淸秀與華麗，可是我却有偏見的喜歡那地方，因爲有一個不惹人厭的雨天。</p>
<p>「川西壩」是一塊平原的盆地，氣候很溫和，雨在這塊幸福的地方，很少表現出牠殘忍的手法，或是傾盆，或是點滴眞珠。也是入春後的天氣，雨便變成人民的密友，我討厭蓉城的街路多塵埃，但雨花常常給我補救了，牠很巧妙，僅僅只灑濕飛揚的路灰，便夾着烏雲去了，太陽的面容又在微笑，我出街很少給烏雲留難過的，夜間，大概有幾天沒有經過雨水洗淋。牠會知趣地落一陣，雨聲生漏筒內察覺，打着院庭內的芭蕉葉，淸脆的多富詩意的音節，有時我夢醒過來，轉念到明早得上少城公園喝茶吧！</p>
<p>經過一夜的洗淋，少城公園內的黃土路，走上去多輕鬆呵，牠的特點是軟軟地，但並不打濕你的鞋底，在「鷄鳴樓「藤椅上品着淡茶，望着在旁流着的小溪河，水溢着了，灰黃地流得很急。長及摟沿的冬靑樹，給雨洗得多光滑啦？葉上留着不多的水珠子，賣報紙雜食的小孩上樓了，皇城內打　樓鐘，九點正，我夾着一疊報紙下樓了。</p>
<p>不過我也在附近的鄕下住過短時間，雨在這裏沒有添給我好感，牠變成了討厭的東西，鄕下的黃土路沒有砂質，雨淋過了，一律成爲汚泥路。鷄公車都沒法載人，我們要進城，得赤脚徒步，不留心，常會滑下田塍</p>
<p>留在昆明渡過秋季，也是一個雨季，雨又和我發生了親感，我形容牠是漂亮的雨天使</p>
<p>一切都很怪，我相信雨不會給昆明的住民埋怨的，叫着一雨季」可是這和熱帶的「雨季」不同，不會一落幾天，不會釀成水災，牠有着很豐富的儲量，細微的雨絲，漂着，漂在行路人的臉上，更誰會理會牠。</p>
<p>我在那兒，化掉一筆很大的價錢買了件雨衣，於是每從「大觀樓」進城去，總是穿着牠，我體會出昆明人的藐視「雨」，我倍覺出牠直漂亮。</p>
<p>在這裏，——上海——落過的雨早止了，汽車開過，一陣水漬聲，我眞討厭　聲音。雨的確是兩重的東西，我愛着牠，同樣我又憎厭着牠。</p>
<h3>根</h3>
<p>— 辛波</p>
<p>有一段路，正沿着王家涇走。王家涇裏的水，爲了幾天的雨，已　起了不少。有些地方，遍是水藻，一攤一攤地散着，有些地方則是初生的野菱，一盤一盤地浮着。小魚一隊一隊地在牠們的根葉間穿來穿去。</p>
<p>過了王家村，不久，阿五就到了小靈山的脚下。上山的路就只有正中的較大較平坦，所以大家都走這條正中的，人便擠了起來。但人擠，並不使阿五不快，反倒增加了他的高興。這樣多的人，何等熱鬧，熱鬧的塲面，一年有幾次！他很知道珍重這個機會。</p>
<p>他雖然足力很健，這山又不高，不必幾步就可以到項，他却走得很慢，不時回過頭來看看山下的景物。一眼就看淸了崇文鎭的全貌，牠沿着長河，東西延展着，也有二三里之遙，密密的屋宇，白的墻壁和黑的屋頂，彼此交映着，因爲在雨後，很像一幅初落筆的風景畫，色彩還沒有乾，有些濕陰陰的意味。</p>
<p>看得有趣，他索性離開了往上湧的人潮，在一塊玫瑰花田旁，立了下來。這田是在山坡上關成的，黃黃的泥土，種了一簇一簇的玫瑰花，正和杭州的茶山差不多。玫瑰花都已經結了蕊，大的天一晴，就要紅艷艷地吐出花瓣來了。</p>
<p>玫瑰花田旁，有幾塊桑樹田，桑枝上都已經綻出葉來，淡黃的顏色，有些像一兩個月以前，楊柳枝上初生的新葉。阿五對牠們，忽然像他鄉遇見故知一樣，發生了興趣，就不再看遠處，而將眼光收起來，專看着牠們，他記起了父母在世時自已家中養蠶的情形。（二〇）</p>
<h3>二月份徵文錄取第三名　怎樣讀書？讀什麼書？</h3>
<p>— 謝廷信</p>
<p>（一）怎樣讀書？</p>
<p>（甲）怎樣獲得書籍　以目前國內情形而論，新書產量劇减，外版書來路斷絕，書價又數十倍於戰前，普通人的購買力，已不能勝任了。勝任了。惟有開闢其他途徑：</p>
<p>（一）利用圖書館利用圖書館是最合經濟學上「以最小的代價獲取最大效用」的原則。（二）向親友借書祗要準時返還，愛惜書籍。（三）淘舊書　淘舊書第一可以低廉的代價得書，第二可獲得坊間絕版的書。（四）交換書籍　使需要者與供給者各得其所，排除居間人從中取利。</p>
<p>（乙）讀書應抱怎樣的態度</p>
<p>（一）抱懷疑的態度孟子說：「盡信書，不如無書」每一作家有他的時代背景，有他個人的見解，讀者應該分析它們，何必跟他盲目的跑呢？（二）不要爲娛樂而讀書日本文學家小泉八雲說：「倫敦雖然每年出版超過六千部書，但是眞正讀書的人很少。他們買書是娛樂，正和他們所說「消閑」」一樣，我想此種情形我國亦很普遍。爲娛樂而讀書，結果徒爲心志的沉醉，破壞思索才能。（三）爲充實生活而誠書　前美國芝加哥大學校長仇蓀博士說「受過高等敎育的人的生活最充實。他能享受與欣賞許多財富所不能購得的東西。」讀書即敎育自己，達到充實生活的目的。</p>
<p>（丙）何時何地讀書</p>
<p>（一）利用生活餘隙讀書　許多短時間的累積，很快的還超過大學敎育全部授課時間。（二）不限地點讀書　日人與英美人在電車裏也要讀書。其精神殊足模楷。我們要在變動的生活空閒中，養成不變動的讀書習慣。</p>

<p>（二）讀什麼書？</p>
<p>（甲）讀已經時代嚴肅試騐的書　爲免浪費精力計，祇有讀最好的書，書的最大批評家是社會。名著的名聲不是若干批評家所造成，而是經數百年人類意見之蓄積所造成。有時我們不能了解數百年來贊賞的巨著的優點。但仔細硏讀，最後定會明白贊賞的理由。潛藏在互著中價値的一殺性永遠不會過去，反因讀者個人生活經騐之進展，而顯現新的意義來</p>
<p>（乙）讀與我們生活相關聯的書一切虛緻，縹渺，幻想之書籍都不必去讀。這些除了麻醉以外，毫無益處。一個人生活是各方面的。每類生活的基本書籍必須讀一些。使生活充滿活力，不落人後。</p>
<p>（丙）讀自已志向所趨的齊</p>
<p>英國科學家的翰魯伯克寫出一本「世界名著表」，有文學名著百種。別的學者亦提出不同的名著。到現在時過境遷，道種名著表成了毫無値價。總之各人方針不同，祗有依照志向所趨，决定要讀的書單。擇佳者硏讀。宜專而不宜廣。</p>

<h3>The Grave Problem of Cultural Paper</h3>
<p>Paper is a tool for preserving culture and communicating knowledge, occupying an extremely important position in the cause of human civilization. Our country is also the inventor of paper and the most common paper-producing nation. Unfortunately, for thousands of years, we have stagnated in the traditional methods of handicraft production, with limited output and inconsistent quality. Only in the last three or four decades have we had modern paper industries, but they are still in their infancy, and most of the paper used for printing comes from foreign countries. According to statistics from 1937, the import value of paper amounted to 65,300,020 yuan. After the Greater East Asia War, foreign paper disappeared, and paper prices soared daily. As a result, the price increases of cultural paper, including newsprint, official letter paper, mimeograph stencils, and carbon paper, have been truly alarming. This has had a significant impact on the stagnation of cultural undertakings. Take Shanghai as an example. It is the cultural center of the country and occupies an important position in calling for cultural revival during this extraordinary period. However, the general publishing industry is still in a state of stagnation, and the high cost of paper is one of the biggest reasons. If this factor is not resolved soon, not only will major bookstores find it difficult to resume publishing books, but also current newspapers and magazines may face a crisis of being unable to continue publishing in the near future. Considering the future of culture, one cannot help but shudder. Further research into the soaring price of newsprint in Shanghai reveals that it is most unreasonable. Except for a small portion produced locally, most of it is foreign goods stockpiled before December 8th of the year before last. Although the price should increase due to changes in currency value and market conditions, it should certainly not increase by more than twenty times compared to the end of the year before last. It is against social consensus and national laws to allow a few people to profit excessively and trap the publishing industry in a state of stagnation.</p>
<p>In order to maintain and develop cultural publishing, we urgently hope that the government authorities and the cultural community will work together to solve the following points: First, is the massive increase in the production of cultural paper. The existing machine-made paper factories in Shanghai should increase production, while also increasing the production of handmade paper and improving its quality. At present, the government should first provide loans to paper manufacturers, encourage production, and enlist the technical talents of friendly nations to jointly improve China's papermaking industry. Second, as a temporary solution, all paper merchants who purchased foreign newsprint before December 8th of the year before last should immediately re-register and implement price limits. For local paper mills, their costs should be estimated and price limits implemented. At the same time, hoarding and speculation by non-paper merchants should be strictly prohibited. Third, is to immediately implement controlled consumption and reasonable allocation. On the one hand, consumption of paper for superstitious purposes should be restricted, and on the other hand, unnecessary commercial flyers and entertainment advertisements should be reasonably restricted. In addition, official documents, letters, and store paper should all be used sparingly. Then, a reasonable allocation should be implemented for newspapers, magazines, and book publishing, providing full guarantees for obtaining paper. Only then can the cultural publishing industry have the hope of reasonable development. It is hoped that the government authorities and the cultural community will work together to maintain the progress of China's cultural publishing industry.</p>
<p>Translation and Discussion</p>
<h3>Charter of the New European Order</h3>
<p>According to a Berlin dispatch, the heads of the Axis powers are discussing the finalized plan for a new European order. A formal statement on this issue will be released soon. As can be seen from the official gazette published on March 1st, this issue was one of the important topics discussed for five days by the German and Italian leaders in Rome starting on February 24th. The publication of the concrete plan for the Axis powers' new European order will make the flags of Germany and Italy even clearer, leaving no room for enemy propaganda. The European countries will be more settled in their positions, praying for the victory of the Axis powers. This cannot be said to be a timely strategy in promoting the common cooperation of European countries.</p>
<p>The official gazette published after the aforementioned Rome talks stated that the people of all nations within the European cooperative system can enjoy the guarantee of social justice by engaging in productive labor within their protected national territories. Furthermore, on the tenth anniversary of the founding of the German Propaganda Ministry on the 13th of this month, Dr. Goebbels, in response to questions from foreign journalists, stated: In the new European order under the Axis powers, all countries can maintain their respective independence, and cooperate in political, economic, diplomatic, and cultural sectors. The idea that Germany is using force to unify Europe and forcing all countries to adopt German National Socialism is clearly inaccurate. Goebbels also said: "During the war, the German people themselves are subject to restrictions on freedom and work under very strict regulations to achieve wartime goals. Similarly, for the people of the countries occupied by the German army and other European countries, it is necessary to take various compulsory measures to carry out the war." In short, the intention of the German and Italian governments is to exclude communism, Jewish influence, and the restrictions of the principle of command, and to respect the independence and autonomy of all countries as much as possible.</p>
<p>Of course, in the past, there were many rumors about the concept of a new European order centered on Germany and Italy, and the actual relationship between Germany, Italy, and European countries has often been misunderstood in the past, which is regrettable. Even regarding the ideal of the new order itself, respecting the will of the people of each country is necessary in principle. Furthermore, from the point of view of timing, it cannot be said that the German and Italian governments are taking wise measures at this time to grasp the public opinion of various countries and dispel their original misunderstandings, so that the people of all countries can understand the true intentions of Germany and Italy. The British government has always emphasized egoism and adopted a policy of supporting small and medium-sized countries, thus signing a mutual assistance treaty with Poland in August 1939. However, to this day, in order to ingratiate itself with the Soviet Union, it has abandoned the countries of Eastern Europe, allowing the Soviet government to handle them freely. Britain today has no qualification to guarantee the countries of the European continent, and in the future, it will have even less room to intervene. For their own purposes, Britain and the United States unhesitatingly sacrifice the security of the European continent and the welfare of the people of all countries. On the contrary, Germany and Italy, the core of the new European order, externally, are strengthening their capacity to protect the European continent, and internally, are solidifying their spiritual unity. Germany and Italy have put a lot of effort into building a new European order, and the development of its future is something to be watched with anticipation.

<h3>Prime Minister Tojo Attends Parliament Reports on Domestic and International Situation Remarkable Progress in Sino-Japanese Cooperation and Expresses Willingness to Assist Burma's Independence</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) The 81st Japanese Parliament held its last plenary session in both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives today, and the closing ceremony is scheduled for tomorrow. Prime Minister Tojo delivered a speech at the plenary session of both houses today. The main points are as follows: Today, I would like to report to you on the recent situation. When I held talks with Burmese officials, including Chief Minister Ba Maw, on the 23rd of this month, I expressed the Empire's intentions regarding the independence of the new Burma and exchanged opinions frankly with each other. I will now report to you the main points of the imperial intentions that I expressed at that time. First, regarding Burma's independence, what the Empire expects is that the new Burmese state can possess the substance of a completely independent country with its own creativity and responsibility, and at the same time, as a member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, closely cooperate with the Empire to contribute to the construction of a new world order. The Empire sincerely hopes that Burma can quickly prepare and adapt to complete the war situation. In terms of the organization of the new Burma, its territory includes all of Burma, except for the Shan States and Karenni. As for the decisions of its people, it is hoped that they can be based on the principles of mutual harmony and unity among the various ethnic groups within the territory. As for the political structure, it should be decided by Burma itself. The operation of state affairs should be strong and simple. Regarding the economy, it is hoped that it can be an integral part of the construction of Greater East Asia, and carry out fair and vigorous activities under the sovereignty of the new Burmese state to promote the revitalization of the Burmese economy. Chief Minister Ba Maw and his delegation were deeply grateful for the special treatment given to our imperial family and understood the true intentions of the imperial government. At that time, they expressed their determination to do everything possible to build the new Burmese state. Recently, I also visited the Republic of China in response to President Wang’s and Premier of the Executive Yuan visit to Japan last year. I would like to express my respect for the National Government's declaration of war against Britain and the United States. I also had frank talks with the National Government authorities on completing the joint war strategy. The leaders and people below the National Government also understood the true intentions of the Empire and deeply appreciated the concrete measures of the Empire's sincerity. Therefore, it can be confirmed that our friendly nation, the Republic of China, is actively working to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. I am very pleased to be able to report this to you. The people of the Republic of China are also gradually understanding the true intentions of the Empire. All aspects are deeply inspired by the measures taken by the Empire this time, and they all have great hope for the future of China. A kind of atmosphere has been created, and they are all willing to engage in the construction of the Republic of China and fully cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War. On the one hand, this proves the strengthening of the political power of the National Government. On the other hand, it proves that the so-called resistance in Chongqing has lost its basis. This is deeply noteworthy. Furthermore, Chongqing was deeply shocked by the enlightened measures taken by the Empire this time. Currently, people in Chongqing are also deeply concerned about the Empire's true intentions and future concrete practices. Recently, the generals in Chongqing on the front lines have also become more and more eager for peace. Therefore, the number of people who surrender has greatly increased compared to before. Britain and the United States are also deeply uneasy about the Empire's new policy towards China, and their embarrassment is difficult to conceal. Today, they have no way to alienate the relationship between the Empire and the new China. Our justice is invincible. Today, Chinese people have agreed with the true intentions of the Empire and are willing to be true comrades who share the same joys and sorrows and live and die together. The closeness of the relationship between the two countries is increasing day by day, which makes us infinitely excited. The Empire's attitude towards the Republic of China and Burma, needless to say, is based on the spirit of Hakkō ichiu and implements the Empire's unshakable national policy. In the midst of this great war, it has been gradually realized, which is truly gratifying. In terms of Europe, the morale of Germany and Italy is becoming more and more prosperous. They are not only repelling enemy forces everywhere, but also concentrating national strength to prepare for a large-scale offensive in the coming days. The leaders of Britain and the United States are only traveling back and forth to hold talks and discuss ways to reverse the defeat. However, because Britain consistently disregards the sacrifices of the United States and other countries, and wants to satisfy its ambition to dominate the world in order to maintain the prosperity and authority of the old Britain, they are therefore in conflict and difficult to resolve. Although they use beautiful words and phrases to talk about their post-war management to cover up the current defeats, they have actually exposed their internal mutual suspicion and the disunity of their anti-war camp. If we compare this kind of ugliness with the close cooperation and mutual assistance of the allied nations of Greater East Asia and the Axis powers such as Germany and Italy to defeat the common enemy of Britain and the United States, we will know that there is a significant difference between us. Therefore, it also increasingly strengthens our belief that we will win. In the past, the government has continuously worked hard to expand the important productive forces that are the urgent task of wartime in order to enhance military power. Recently, this parliament has passed the Wartime Administrative Special Cases Act and other bills. However, in order to fully adopt the various high-level views of this parliament in order to achieve comprehensive application, we will make every effort to enhance wartime production and have formulated the temporary system of cabinet advisors, the administrative inspection system, and the establishment of the Wartime Economic Consultative Council. The development of the domestic and foreign situation described above has gradually become more favorable to us. However, the progress of the world war is not yet optimistic. All 100 million of our people should renew their determination, endure the difficulties under the increasingly heavy war in the future, and redouble their efforts to win the final victory.</p>
<h3>President Wang Speaks to Japanese Reporters in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 25th (Central News Agency) President Wang of the National Government met with a group of Japanese reporters at his official residence here at 9:00 a.m. on the 25th and spoke on the significance of the National Government's participation in the war and the purpose of his decision to come to Guangzhou. The gist of the speech was as follows: The reason and significance of the National Government's participation in the war are very clear. We have followed Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings as the foundation of our policy and have always thought about when we can live and die together with our friendly nation, Japan. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government immediately issued a statement, resolving to share the joys and sorrows with Japan. Now, we have taken a further step and resolutely decided to live and die together with Japan. We have carefully considered how we can cooperate with Japan in order to contribute to the Greater East Asia War. As a result, we decided to participate in the war. However, it is not because we know that Japan is in an absolutely invincible position that we are participating in the war. It is because if we only engage in peace movements when we must cooperate with Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War, our direction is actually not clear. In order to break the deep-seated dependence on Britain and the United States among the people and build East Asia for East Asians, we have no choice but to participate in the war. The direction that the Chinese people should take has been completely determined by the National Government's participation in the war, and has become more focused and clearer. After our participation in the war, we should reduce the burden on our friendly nations and contribute to the war, and we must increase production and make full use of resources. Furthermore, since the National Government's participation in the war, Japan has returned concessions, withdrawn extraterritorial rights, and provided assistance in various aspects, which has deeply impressed our country. We are determined to redouble our efforts and continue to work hard so as not to fail the cooperation of our friendly nations. Guangzhou is close to Hong Kong, and most of the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia are from Guangzhou. Therefore, the people of Guangzhou know the most detailed details of the aggression by Britain and the United States, and they are also the most deeply infected by British and American ideas. In the past, the United States ran Ginling College in Nanjing, Yenching University and Tsinghua University in Beiping, Lingnan University in Guangzhou, Nankai University in Tianjin, and St. John's University in Shanghai. The purpose of these universities was to numb the Chinese intellectual class and alienate the feelings between China and Japan. Jiang Jieshi's continued delusion and continued resistance to Japan have been supported by many intellectuals who have been educated by Britain and the United States. Today, Chongqing has completely become the fifth column of Britain and the United States. Although Jiang Jieshi knows that Dr. Sun Yat-sen wanted to remove the forces of Britain and the United States and their ideas from East Asia, he is still being used by Britain and the United States, so he is actually a traitor to China. Therefore, in order to thoroughly eradicate the idea of ​​dependence on Britain and the United States, we must quickly launch a fierce ideological war.</p>

Every day, countless refugees are fleeing west along the railway and highway to Shaanxi to find food. I have seen refugees fleeing from war zones and bombing zones, but I have never seen such a miserable sight of millions of hungry people. There are very few young women or children among these refugees, because most of them have been sold. A young woman can be sold for 100 yuan. Food must be shipped immediately to provide relief, otherwise, an unprecedented tragedy will occur in the province."</p>
<h3>Ayasawa Expresses Impressions of Visit to China</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) According to a Fukuoka telephone report, Ayasawa, the Japanese special envoy to Vietnam, flew from Shanghai to Fukuoka by plane on the 25th after visiting China to inspect the current situation of the Chinese government. At the airport, he made the following remarks: Prime Minister Tojo's visit to Nanjing and Japan's abolition of extraterritorial rights and the return of concessions have had an extremely good impact on the National Government. The general public in China is extremely delighted. The current situation of the National Government has made amazing progress. Although prices in the vicinity of Shanghai are quite expensive, due to the efforts of our embassy in China and advisor Ishiwatari, there is a possibility of prices falling. Furthermore, the linking system of the Central Reserve Bank Notes has now been established, so the financial sector may progress smoothly in the future.</p>
<h3>National Government Order Announced: Regulations for Industrial and Commercial Associations; Industrial and Commercial Association Law to be Immediately Abolished</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 25th – Central News Agency: The National Government issued an order (March 25th, Year 32): "Now, the Provisional Regulations for Industrial and Commercial Associations are hereby enacted and promulgated. This order is issued. The Industrial and Commercial Association Law is to be immediately abolished. This order is issued."</p>
<p>Full Text of the Regulations</p>
<p>Nanjing, 25th – Central News Agency: Today, at the 9th meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council, Minister Mei of the Ministry of Industry proposed that, in order to adjust and strengthen wartime economic organizations, the old Industrial and Commercial Association Law is no longer suitable for the current environment. At this time of implementing a unified control policy, everything relies on the cooperation of various trade associations. He specially drafted the Provisional Regulations for Industrial and Commercial Associations and submitted it for public resolution. It was revised and passed, sent to the National Government for promulgation, and the old Industrial and Commercial Association Law was abolished by order of the National Government. The Provisional Regulations are recorded as follows:</p>

<h3>Three Days of Fierce Fighting on the Mareth Line: Axis Forces Maintain Original Position; Rommel's Mobile Defense Tactics Effective</h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th – Allied News Agency: The German authorities announced on the 24th that the Axis forces in North Africa had completely repelled the British forces attacking the Mareth Line and are now firmly defending the same battle line as before the start of the offensive.</p>
<p>Berlin, 25th – Haitong News Agency: The great battle in southern and central Tunisia has not yet reached its most intense stage. The enemy's attempt to break through the Axis forces' position has not yet succeeded. The U.S. forces in central Tunisia have been reinforced by British forces. The German-Italian Allied forces on the Mareth Line have recaptured many strongholds. The enemy's troop strength and war equipment are very sufficient. The losses from three days of fierce fighting are difficult to make up. After the Battle of El Alamein, Montgomery often used elite troops as reserves and only deployed them to assist in the most intense stages of the battle. The British forces seem to be encircling the southwest and west of the Matmata Mountains, disrupting the western part of the Mareth Line. However, General Rommel's mobile defense tactics have once again proved effective. However, the enemy's offensive has not abated, and the fierce battle will continue.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 24th – Havas News Agency: Fierce fighting on the Tunisian front continued today. The Allied forces acknowledge that the German forces are strongly defending the Mareth Line and state that Rommel's forces have attempted to drive out the British forces, but the British forces are still able to defend their position. In addition, the British forces, maneuvering to attack the rear of the Mareth Line, have occupied the Dabalgar Mountains, eight miles from El Hamma. The British forces intend to flank the German forces from there, but have been blocked by Rommel's forces. According to U.S. sources, the U.S. forces are also making slight progress in fighting along the railway line from Metlaoui to the port of Sfax. It is rumored that they have occupied the highlands five miles east of Maknassi. However, U.S. intelligence director Davis made a statement in Washington, stating that the nation should not be too optimistic about the actions of U.S. forces in North Africa. According to a Berlin announcement, the offensive of the British Eighth Army has been repelled by Rommel's forces, and there are no changes in the positions of either side. Regarding the northern front, according to British and U.S. sources, the Axis forces only have scouting and artillery activity. There is no mention of how the British First Army is acting.</p>
<h3>Eastern Front Thaws and Roads are Muddy: Major Battles Come to a Halt</h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th – Haitong News Agency: The battlefields of the Eastern Front are covered in mud, causing inconvenience to both the enemy and ourselves, making large-scale battles impossible. Only the enemy forces south of Leningrad and Lake Ladoga are more active, attempting to counterattack, mobilizing large artillery and air forces for combat, but have not yet succeeded. There are only local battles in other sections. Enemy attacks on German positions have been repelled. The German forces are conducting successful mopping-up operations in the area between Izyum and Belgorod. The German advance west of Kursk has been halted due to muddy roads. The Soviet forces in the Kupiansk bridgehead have concentrated six battalions of troops to attempt an offensive, but have been contained by the German forces.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet border, 25th – Havas News Agency: According to the latest Soviet war report, the Red Army in the southern region has made slight progress in the Kupiansk area, occupying several villages and densely populated areas, including the Kireevo and Kiivka stations. On the Donets front, German forces crossed the northern section of the Donets River at Peski-Radkovskie and established a bridgehead on the east bank. Moscow acknowledges that German troops have occupied a densely populated area on the left bank, but after a Red Army counterattack, the German forces retreated to the right bank. In the Kursk area, German forces continue to advance on the enemy in order to flatten the Red Army salient west of Kursk. North of there, the Red Army acknowledges that German forces have launched repeated fierce counterattacks at Sukharevka (40 miles northeast of the German's strong hedgehog position in Smolensk), but have been stopped by the Red Army. General Konev's forces, along the Vyazma-Smolensk railway line, are attacking Smolensk, but have not made much progress. However, one army advancing south along the railway branch line claims to have occupied the city of Rukhnovo. On the northern front, General Timoshenko's forces continue to attack, especially in the area around Lake Ladoga, but Berlin sources say that this offensive has been successfully repelled by German forces. Various observers on the Soviet border believe that the focus of the Eastern Front may soon shift to the southern region, as the roads there are easier to dry than elsewhere. The Red Army's progress in the Kupiansk area is limited. German forces are holding positions west of Kupiansk and have brought in a large number of cannons, mortars, and machine guns to defend their positions with "arced fire."</p>
<h3>British Troops in Iran and Iraq: Pownall Appointed Commander-in-Chief</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 25th – Allied News Agency: According to a report from the capital of Iraq, General Wilson, Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in Iran and Iraq, has been transferred to be Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in the Middle East. His vacant position will be succeeded by General Pownall. General Pownall has arrived in Baghdad to take over.</p>
<p>Ankara, 25th – Haitong News Agency: A dispatch from Cairo states that Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas, despite being ill, met with General Wilson, Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in the Middle East, yesterday for a long discussion. The content is unknown.</p>
<h3>Turkey Watching European Developments: Neutral Countries Skeptical of Anglo-Soviet Understanding</h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th – Haitong News Agency: Neutral public opinion remains reserved about the Anglo-American-Soviet dispute over the future fate of small countries. Only Turkish newspapers have begun to comment on the British proposal, concluding that Turkey is closely monitoring the developments of this matter. Turkey's current position seems to be dealing with threats from three sides. From Berlin's perspective, the attitude of various neutral countries seems to be skeptical of the Anglo-Soviet understanding to guarantee Europe. Regarding Germany's total mobilization, various neutral countries believe that it will surely unleash a tremendous force.</p>
<h3>German Side Announces Submarine Warfare Results</h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th – Haitong News Agency: The German High Command announced yesterday that 15 enemy merchant ships, totaling 73,000 tons, had been sunk. In total, German submarines have sunk 121 enemy ships this month, totaling 748,000 tons. The 15 ships recently sunk were from a convoy traveling from the United States to Gibraltar. German submarines pursued them along the way, achieving this success.</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th – Haitong News Agency: It was announced today that German submarines and escort ships sank five British submarines in the Mediterranean Sea. Tokyo, 25th – Haitong News Agency: According to news from Washington, the U.S. Navy Department claims that two U.S. convoys were attacked by submarines in the Atlantic, resulting in significant losses for U.S. ships.</p>
<h3>German Convoy Attacked Near Dutch Coast</h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th – Haitong News Agency: Responsible officials here claim that a German convoy was attacked by British gunboats and speedboats near Terschelling on the Dutch coast yesterday morning.

<h3>Japanese-Vietnamese Cooperation Intensifies, Chongqing's Activities Completely Fail</h3>
<p>(Saigon, Special Correspondent Matsunaga, 15th Dispatch) "A French Indochinese colonial army will, in the not-too-distant future, fight against the Chongqing army." This is not the raving of a journalist in Vietnam. The Vichy government's statement on the 23rd of last month, declaring the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of concessions, signifies a refusal to recognize the Chiang Kai-shek regime. The Chongqing side's acting ambassador to Vichy has already withdrawn to Lisbon, and it is rumored that French diplomats stationed in Chongqing are under house arrest. The diplomatic relationship between France and Chongqing is essentially severed. Several hundred French expatriates still reside in Chongqing, Kunming, and the Chinese interior. The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, which supports Chiang Kai-shek, is a joint Sino-French venture, starting from Haiphong, passing through Hanoi and Lao Cai, and reaching Kunming. The day these arrangements are finalized will also be the day Chongqing and Vichy mutually declare the end of diplomatic relations. France, which was utterly defeated in the prelude to the Second European War, is now acting with extreme complexity and subtlety. The suffering of a defeated nation is profound. French Indochina, thousands of miles from the motherland, is drawn into the vortex of the Greater East Asia War, isolated in a corner of Greater East Asia. Its future is certainly not a smooth road.</p>
<p>Since June of last year, the reporter has been stationed in Vietnam, observing the turbulence in military, political, economic, and cultural aspects. The expression of Vietnam, with lingering shadows, adapts to the shifting international situation, keenly changing its attitude. Governor-General Decoux and the leadership of the colony have a very correct understanding of the situation during this period, and thus their actions have not been mistaken. The illegal actions of British and American forces invading French North Africa in November of last year determined the path France should take. This break with the Chongqing regime further unfolds a new situation worth watching. Since French Indochina borders the provinces of Yunnan and Guangxi, it can be said to have reached a stage of determining its destiny. The reporter has a personal experience of its turbulence and feels that now is the opportunity to truthfully recount the truth of French Indochina, hence the writing of this on-the-spot report.</p>
<p>In July 1941, the agreement between Japan and France regarding the joint defense of Japanese-Vietnamese territories was a military and economic agreement taken by the Japanese army. The spiritual content of every Vietnamese soldier is extremely poor. Although the Chongqing army, a puppet of Britain and America, is an enemy of the Japanese army, a part of the Vietnamese army defending the Sino-Vietnamese border does not consider them an enemy that should be jointly destroyed with the Japanese army. Such a strange phenomenon exists in the tense border.</p>
<p>In November of last year, the author inspected the situation on the front lines of the Vietnamese-Chinese border in early winter, only three hundred meters away from the fortress of the Chongqing army. The reporter heard the following anecdote directly from the young generals confronting the Yunnan army, which is presented below:</p>
<p>One day, a certain Japanese general was patrolling the border security when a French officer came out from the Chinese border side. When questioned, he replied that he was scouting the enemy's situation. In fact, the French officer had dined in the Chongqing army camp guarding the border and was returning. He was immediately reprimanded, and he defended himself plausibly: "What I give to the Chongqing army is textiles, salt, and sugar, and the gifts I bring back to the Japanese army are the equipment and movements of the Yunnan army. I am definitely not selling out Japanese intelligence." At that time, a part of the Vietnamese army, which jointly defended the colony with the Japanese army, often concealed it from the eyes of the Japanese army, crossed the border, and interacted with the Chongqing army. At that time, two or three French officers, dissatisfied with the pro-Japanese policies of the top leadership, went to join the Chongqing army.</p>
<p>The French fortress of the Vietnamese Maginot Line, standing on the high ground near Chi Lăng, cost a total of 20 million Vietnamese dong to build. If a war breaks out there, will the roar of the cannons be directed at Chongqing?</p>
<p>However, the world situation, centered on France, has undergone drastic changes. France has severed diplomatic relations with Britain and the United States, and recently broke ties with Chongqing. This is a welcome thing for Franco-Japanese-Vietnamese friendship. A certain general, after inspecting the Japanese and French armies defending the border, said:</p>
<p>"The border security is now perfect. When the French-Vietnamese army joins forces with the Japanese army, the Chongqing army will not be able to cross the border one step." The French army unit commander, acting as a guide, led a detailed inspection of the interior of the fortress and sent over military secret maps.</p>
<p>Recently, the attitude of the French-Vietnamese army has been completely open and trusting of the Japanese army. The Japanese-French-Vietnamese military agreement now lives up to its name, and cooperation is seamless.</p>
<p>Around the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Tagore elements scattered in Malaya and other parts of the Co-Prosperity Sphere fled the war to Vietnam. Da Lat, the only highland resort in southern Vietnam, 300 kilometers south of Saigon, is their refuge. They used wireless communications to secretly contact their comrades, brewing a pro-British and American atmosphere. Now their covert activities, under the strict surveillance of the Japanese and Vietnamese authorities, have almost ceased. Xoài Rinh in the south is a concentration point for overseas Chinese supporting Chiang Kai-shek. Before the Greater East Asia War, it was known for opium and gambling along with Saigon, and was a stage for active international intelligence.</p>
<p>Southern Vietnam produces three thousand several hundred million piculs of rice, most of which is in the hands of 250,000 overseas Chinese centered around trading houses. Xoài Rinh has thus become a completely Chinese city. Recently, large-scale investigations of communists and crackdowns on overseas Chinese supporting Chiang Kai-shek have been carried out. Before the end of last year, the skies were full of Chongqing antennas, and the exchange of secret information was extremely busy.</p>
<p>Spies from Chongqing infiltrated Vietnam and were very active. The Tagore elements, overseas Chinese supporting Chiang Kai-shek, and communists lurking in Vietnam have been repeatedly suppressed by the Japanese and Vietnamese authorities and completely cleared. Vietnam's security is now worry-free.</p>
<p>From the entry into northern Indochina in 1940, the entry into southern Indochina in 1941, to the current stage of the Greater East Asia War, the military and economic tasks that Vietnam has fulfilled as a logistics base cannot but be given due evaluation. The ties linked by the dual belts of the Japanese-Vietnamese Joint Defense and the Economic Agreement are becoming stronger. The Japanese army and navy entered the French Concession of Guangzhou Bay on the 21st of last month with the understanding of France, the Vichy government declared the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of the concessions on the 23rd of last month, and the strengthening of the Japanese-Vietnamese Economic Agreement announced on the 5th of this month are all clear evidence. This attitude of dependency and cooperation with Japan can also be seen in the negotiations between the Japanese representatives and Governor-General Decoux and Economic Director Marton. The General Manager of the Bank of Indochina, Gana, candidly stated:</p>
<p>Vietnam's current trade, industry, finance, and so on, are breaking away from their original dependence on France and now, as a member of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, are dependent on Japan.</p>
<p>Vietnam is cooperating with Japan with all its strength in exporting rice, corn, and other agricultural products to Japan, expressing Vietnam's sincerity. Recent examples include restricting its own needs and agreeing to supply Japan with large quantities of timber and cement. Japan is trying its best to help Vietnam control the inflationary trend caused by the lack of materials.</p>
<p>France's approach to the Axis powers has become increasingly apparent recently. Minister for Greater East Asia, Aoki, in replying to a question from a certain member of parliament, said:</p>
<p>"Vietnam now fully understands Japan's trust and is actively cooperating with Japan in political and economic aspects. The realization of joint defense is the only path Vietnam should take, and Vietnam is deeply aware of this."</p>
<p>This statement by the Minister for Greater East Asia is acknowledged by local Japanese people. All of France's colonies have been ravaged by Britain and the United States, and the Indochina Peninsula is the last colony maintained by France, so it has no choice but to depend on it to maintain its existence. There are 40,000 French people living in Vietnam, singing the national anthem under the tricolor flag, and they are the happiest people. Among the French people in Vietnam, there are also those who firmly believe that Britain and the United States will win the final victory; however, the astonishing attack of the Japanese army shattered this hope. France's recent dismal expression is, of course, due to understanding the current situation of the various colonies. If Vietnam can understand Japan's sincerity, it will naturally understand the path Vietnam should take. With its rich resources as a background, Vietnam should take new and solid strides.

<h3>A Visit to the Tokyo Rope Manufacturing Factory</h3>
<p>A steel wire that is completely seamless and as long as 4,000 to 5,000 meters must be flawless in terms of its granularity, decarburization, structure, thickness, surface, tensile strength, elongation, twisting, bending, grinding, etc. You must still remember the elevator and cable car tragedies that occurred in the past.</p>
<p>To strengthen a steel wire, it must first be annealed, pickled in acid, neutralized with lime, and dried. Then, it is passed through the holes of a wire drawing machine many times to make it a thin and strong steel wire. In general, to turn a steel bar three-tenths of an inch in diameter into something as thin as hair, it must go through more than thirty processes. However, in these processes, a lot of soap is used to make the steel wire very smooth. In addition to various machines, this factory also has various important materials such as iron, coal, sulfuric acid, lime, soap, special steel, and hemp.</p>
<p>The perfectly made steel wire is then twisted into various shapes using hemp thread as the core to form steel cables. It is regrettable that the importance of steel cables in modern warfare is not given more attention. Due to space limitations, the important uses of steel cables in war cannot be listed in detail. In short, without steel cables, aircraft at sea and on land cannot be operated; balloons and sea mines cannot be secured; minesweepers will lose their mission; and both warships and ordinary ships will encounter major obstacles. Moreover, it would be impossible to set up anti-submarine nets in the sea, and warships would be unable to defend against sea mines. In other words, without steel cables, warships, cannons, and tanks cannot be produced. In the production lines of the rear, the haulage ropes, balance ropes, hoisting ropes, and rails used to transport coal, iron, copper, other important ores, and timber are unimaginable without steel cables.</p>
<p>Under the current decisive battle situation, the Tokyo Rope Manufacturing Factory, which bears this important task, was founded on February 1, 1892, by Baron Eiichi Shibusawa, Masakuni Yamada, and others. Initially, it focused on manufacturing Manila hemp ropes, but after 1900, it gradually shifted to manufacturing steel cables. Since the factory has such an old tradition, the average length of service of its employees and workers is fifteen years, and it is not uncommon for people to have served in the factory for three or four decades. Mr. Daiketsu Ikeda (currently 74 years old), who is currently working as a warehouseman, has a history of 52 years in the factory and was still working enthusiastically in the factory at the end of last year. Mr. Ikeda started working at the factory when the price of rice was six sen per go, and his daily wage at that time was 16 sen. He was originally a veteran who participated in both the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War. Here, whether it is a senior worker or a new-era worker, they are united by a supreme love of country, and everyone expresses a sincere willingness to cooperate in production from the bottom of their hearts.</p>
<p>"Does our production really make any contribution to the front lines! Or is it insignificant?"</p>
<p>Such sincere concern unites the hearts of all 00 people in the factory. All actions can be summarized in the phrase "for victory." Every gesture and step is focused on this one and only goal. In short, all the employees of this factory are advancing courageously with such a brave spirit.</p>
<p>However, in terms of the character of this factory, there is one thing that makes people worry that cannot be taken lightly. If they are employees who manufacture shells or bullets, then the shells are used to destroy the barbaric British and Americans, and the bullets are used to pierce the chests of those who do not obey. This awareness is expressed very strongly, and in their work, they show a spirit of enthusiasm that is no less than that of the soldiers on the front lines. However, the direct relationship between a steel wire and the Greater East Asia War is a bit difficult for these honest young workers to understand. No, it is of course difficult to understand, and needless to say, the issue of counterintelligence must also be considered; however, making them fully understand the relationship between the part and the whole in increasing production is the most important thing. Therefore, I believe that the only way to increase production is to inspire the gratitude of young people. It is necessary to explain to them in detail the relationship between their products and the soldiers on the front lines, and to make them fully understand the important uses of their products within the possible range. For example, if the driving cable manufactured in Factory A is not completed in time, it will prevent 20 or 30 aircraft in Factory B, which have already had their frames assembled, from being able to start assembling the airframes, and the workers will have to stand idle. This is a major issue that cannot be ignored. For young workers who are full of gratitude, it is necessary to use simple and sincere words to connect "a steel wire and the manufacturing sequence of an aircraft and the activities of the pilot" and explain it to them clearly so that they can understand it. This will inspire them from the bottom of their hearts, and the effect on increasing production will probably be beyond imagination. They may not want to hear empty and pleasant words such as calling them industrial warriors or praising them as first-line warriors in the rear. They would rather hear more about how the products of the parts they manufacture are related to the overall war situation. Only by making them aware of this is it the right way to expand production and the fundamental essence of expanding production. I know they have such a sincere and healthy demand, so I feel that there is great hope for future production increases. This is not what I am saying to the factory, but what I am saying from the bottom of my heart to the authorities.</p>
<p>I held two symposiums with the employees of the factory and heard many beautiful stories. However, what is called a beautiful story here should not be regarded as a beautiful story, but as an ordinary thing. The gas team did not rest on New Year's Day, and they voluntarily donated the wages they earned to the country.</p>
<p>"The wages for working on a holiday should not be paid."</p>
<p>This is their honest assertion. Those who greedily want to earn wages without working should be ashamed to death when they hear this.</p>
<p>The brother of a certain worker in the silk manufacturing department was being treated for war wounds and died in critical condition. He sent a letter to the worker, which read:</p>
<p>"Your brother fought for the country and unfortunately lost his life. You are now serving the country and should not neglect your duties for even one day because of your brother's funeral. On a day off, you may go out and pay your respects at your brother's grave."</p>
<p>As a child, I once read "The Sailor's Mother" and was moved to tears, but the spirit of the Japanese mother model expressed in this letter is no less magnificent than that book. There are currently 00 female labor service corps members from Yamagata Prefecture working in an important part of this factory. These women from the snowy country are all so simple and sincere, and they work so seriously that they make people bow their heads in admiration. There are also several women who graduated from girls' schools among them. They take advantage of the winter agricultural off-season to come to the military supply factory, and when the soil and water warm up, they return to their hometowns to take up hoes and engage in food production increase. I believe that among these women, women like the mother of that worker are certainly growing.</p>
<p>After visiting this factory, I spent the night in the factory's dormitory that evening, and the next morning I went to visit the factory's farm, which covers an area of two hectares. Everything is regular, neat, and military-style. The dormitory is clean, the meals are nutritious, and the welfare facilities are also complete.</p>
<p>Before eating, the workers always make the following reflection:</p>
<p>"We, who are lacking in virtue, feel ashamed to enjoy such food. We will never have any complaints or dissatisfaction, at any time or in any place."</p>
<p>After listening to this reflection, I could not help but deeply reflect on myself as well. (Original by Tsunehisa Sakurada - Ding: Translated from the March 18th Yomiuri Hochi)</p>

<h3>Postponement of Food Ration Coupon Issuance by One Day; Mixed Grain Rationing Imminent; Sales with Certificates Expected to Begin on April 1st</h3>
<p>In order to fully ration household food, the Concession authorities, in addition to issuing rice and flour certificates on schedule, based on which people can purchase from the designated 665 contracted rice shops, will also issue an extra set of mixed grain certificates, the first and second coupons, for the rationing of mixed grains and beans. Shanghai Social News reporters learned yesterday from rice industry sources that the rice industry association was originally scheduled to collect the sales coupons for the 31st period of household food rations from the Public Works Department rationing office yesterday and distribute them to its member rice shops. However, due to insufficient procedures, the collection has been changed to today. However, according to rice industry sources, the 31st period will also include an additional rationing of mixed grains, which can be purchased from the designated rice shops with mixed grain certificates, but this will only be clear after the sales coupons are collected today. As for the quantity, type, and price of rice, flour, and mixed grains to be sold, this is subject to the official announcement by the two Concession authorities. The next period of household food ration sales will be from April 1st to the 9th, and failure to collect within the deadline will render the certificates invalid.</p>

<h3>Secret Investigation of the Unemployed by the Concession Authorities; Householders Responsible for Reporting</h3>
<p>In order to establish security within the Concessions, the Concession authorities have begun a secret investigation of the unemployed within the Concessions. With regard to the activities of the unemployed, the leaders of the Jia (neighborhoods) were secretly instructed to order the householders to pay close attention. If there is any transgressive behavior or illegal activity found, the householders should immediately secretly report to the Jia leaders, who will then report to the Lianbao (community) leaders and submit it to the competent authorities. If the householders conceal and do not report, they will be subject to a considerable fine. If the circumstances are serious, the householders will be subject to a severe wartime legal judgment.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Grain Management Bureau; Establishment of a Rationing Office</h3>
<p>In accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Food, the Municipal Grain Administration Bureau will soon be reorganized into a Grain Bureau to suit the wartime food policy. The internal organization will also be changed. Matters related to the rationing of rice, mixed grains, oil, sugar, etc., will be managed by a newly established Rationing Office. In addition, Sections 1, 2, and 3 will be responsible for agricultural production matters. The Bureau is currently actively planning this, and it is expected to be implemented around April 1st.</p>
<h3>Spokesperson of the Japanese Army Press Department Reports on the Situation in Burma and Introduces the Revival of Jinhua</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon (25th) at 3:00 PM, the press department of the Japanese Army in Shanghai, as usual, held a reception for the Chinese press corps of the city. A staff officer of the Japanese army unit coming from Jinhua, Zhejiang East, introduced the current situation of Jinhua's revival in detail. Subsequently, the spokesperson reported on the recent situation in Burma, which lasted until after 3:15 PM.</p>
<p>General Construction in Jinhua. It is said that the revival of Jinhua is under active construction, especially the major transportation routes, such as bridges, which have been gradually restored. For example, the "Tongji Bridge" and "Yulong Bridge" in Jinhua were damaged in the war, causing inconvenience to the people. After the joint construction and repair by the Japanese army and local people, they have been completed. In addition, a "Wanfo Pagoda" is under active renovation. A brief explanation of the Wanfo Pagoda follows: the pagoda has twelve levels and was severely damaged by artillery fire. After the Japanese army occupied Jinhua, in order to preserve China's cultural heritage, they worked hard to renovate it in order to restore its former appearance. Next, it was mentioned that Jinhua is the birthplace of Zhejiang financial magnates and has a huge influence on China's finance and economy. After the Japanese army stationed there, they worked hard to replenish supplies. Currently, in terms of entertainment, three theaters have been opened. In terms of education, fifteen elementary schools and one junior high school have been established. There is also a senior girls' high school in preparation, which is expected to open soon. Students generally understand the spirit of the National Government's life and death with friendly nations after the war. They also have a deep understanding of the Anglo-American powers who are fighting the common enemy in East Asia. The people and students have a considerable understanding of the true meaning of Sun Yat-sen's Greater Asianism.</p>
<p>Military Situation in Burma. Subsequently, the spokesperson of the military headquarters gave a detailed account of the situation of the war in Burma, as follows: Recently, the Allied nations, including Britain, the United States, and Chongqing, have made the recovery of Burma their main goal. The Chongqing side is preparing to launch an offensive on the Yunnan-Burma Road and has specially appointed Chen Cheng as the commander-in-chief of the Expeditionary Force. Chen Cheng's former position as the commander of the Sixth War Zone has now been taken over by Sun Lianzhong. Currently, Chen Cheng's troops are stationed in western Yunnan. The British army in India is also preparing to launch an offensive from India. Overall, it is currently impossible for the Chongqing army to launch an offensive against Burma independently. They can only defend their own territory to resist further offensives by the Japanese army. Observing the current situation in Yunnan, although Chen Cheng's troops are stationed in western Yunnan, eastern Yunnan is still under the control of Long Yun. Chen Cheng's military strength now consists of twenty-four divisions and seven brigades, organized into the Eleventh Army Group. In addition, there is the Fifth Army Group, commanded by Du Yuming, the former commander of the Fifth Army in Burma, which includes the Seventy-first Army (with Song Xilian as the commander) (with four divisions and one newly编师), the Sixth Army (with three divisions), the Fifth Army (with three divisions), the Second Army (with three divisions), and the Eighth Army (with three divisions). The Seventy-first Army under the Eleventh Army Group is currently stationed in Dali, Yunnan. The Sixth Army under the Fifth Army Group is stationed in Yunnan, connecting to the Burmese border area. The main force of the Fifth Army Group is in Kunming. A part of the military force is in the northeast of Dali, and the rest is the Second Army, which has been moved from Guiyang to Fengyi, and the Eighth Army, which has been moved from Changde to Kunming. Currently, there are only ninety American Air Force planes in Chongqing.</p>
<p>Recent Military Situation in India and Burma. Regarding the general situation in Burma and India, the army in India is controlled by the British, and the air force is controlled by the Americans. Since the British army withdrew from Riyue in mid-February last year, they have suffered heavy losses due to fierce attacks by the Japanese army. The enemy is also facing difficulties in supply due to geographical obstacles. Therefore, they are increasingly anxious to recapture the Burma Road. In order to prevent the British and Americans from making any further moves, the Japanese army launched a large-scale offensive in early March, and the enemy was defeated in a rout. Subsequently, the enemy, whose army was blocked, launched a counter-offensive by air. Therefore, in early February, the enemy launched as many as eighty-seven air raids, with a total of four hundred and fifty-one aircraft sorties. These air raid locations are all in indefinite locations on the front line. This further proves that the Anglo-American and Chongqing regime's attempts to seize Burma have become a fantasy after being severely attacked by the Japanese army. It is expected that large-scale guerrilla warfare will be launched in the future. Finally, it was mentioned that the Indian army is unwilling to assist the British and Americans in the war, while the Indian people are fully serving the Japanese army. This has proved that the Japanese army is in an absolutely superior position. The enemy army in India currently has ten divisions and two brigades under Wavell, with an air force of more than 400 aircraft, which is the responsibility of the Americans. As for the Chongqing expeditionary force in India, there are a total of seventeen divisions, also commanded by Chen Cheng. Finally, it was pointed out that He Yingqin's report on his inspection of India was full of boastful words.</p>
<h3>Newly Purchased Radios Must Be Registered with Invoices; Those Who Have Registered but Lost Their Documents Must Send Their Radios for Inspection to Reissue</h3>
<p>Since the registration of wireless radios in this port, all residents with radios have completed the registration procedures. The police stations in each district have already submitted the registration books to the General Registration Office. According to a report from a Datong News Agency reporter, residents in the two concessions who have newly purchased wireless radios should go to the Wireless Radio Registration Office at No. 610, Jianshe Building, Jiang Si Road, Fuzhou Road, with their purchase invoices to complete the registration procedures. As for those who have already registered but lost their registration certificates, they must personally bring the radio to the registration office in Jianshe Building to complete the re-issuance procedure.</p>
<p>Overdue Registration Fines</p>
<p>The military and police authorities in this city have strictly managed wireless radios and ordered registration. The registration has been quite enthusiastic, and all radios have been inspected, and shortwave radios have been dismantled. The results have been quite satisfactory. The registration deadline has also been closed. However, in order to take into account ignorant citizens who may still not have registered, the authorities are still continuing to handle the registration procedures, but they must be punished according to the regulations, with fines ranging from ten to one hundred yuan, depending on the length of the overdue period.</p>
<p>According to investigations: There are more than forty offices of various organs of the National Government in Shanghai. If we add the offices of the Peace Army or those related to special agent work, the number will be even more alarming.</p>
<p>Including the Japanese side, the so-called excessive establishment of institutions and the complexity of types have always been regarded as a problem, whether in Shanghai or inland. However, the Japanese side, since the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry and the implementation of new policies to adapt to the new situation after the National Government's participation in the war, has been improving the institutions that were generally criticized by the public. What about the Chinese side? Because this is China's internal affairs, we are not in a position to comment, but we can only hope from the standpoint of collaborators. If we were to express our hopes frankly, then the integration and reorganization of central and local administrative institutions is the current practical need, especially in Shanghai.</p>
<p>When will the recovery of the Public Concession take place? In what form will it be implemented? This cannot be predicted, and the sooner or later is unknown, but it will inevitably be realized in the near future. This can be understood by simply reading Ambassador Shigemitsu's remarks. Once recovered, it can be asserted that the new municipal form will necessarily simplify the complex and disorganized Shanghai administrative institutions. We firmly believe in the necessity of this move and hold the highest expectations.</p>
<p>I think that the National Government or the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, which is responsible for recovering the concessions, is probably preparing all the recovery steps, but the problem of the offices stationed in Shanghai is not known</p>
<h3>Translation and Commentary: Adjustment of Offices Stationed in Shanghai</h3>
<p>what considerations will be given. We sincerely hope that the National Government will make a wise and appropriate decision on this issue. The merger, reorganization, and abolition of offices stationed in Shanghai is a separate issue from the recovery of the concessions. In short, in order to strengthen the Shanghai Special Municipal Government and promote the integrated relationship between Nanjing and Shanghai, the above-mentioned hope can be understood without explicitly stating it. (Yunpeng: Translated from the March 25th edition of the Continental New Daily)</p>
<h3>Short Comment: Welcome President Takashima</h3>
<p>Mr. Kikujiro Takashima, who succeeded Mr. Kenji Kodama as the president of the Central China Revitalization Company, arrived in Shanghai safely from Tokyo yesterday. While extending our respectful welcome, we would like to raise several expectations:</p>
<p>The Central China Revitalization Company is the largest economic institution in Central China, and its affiliated businesses include mining, industry, transportation, communications, public utilities, etc., with a total of sixteen units. The success or failure of its management has an impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood, especially for those who are participating in the total war. Based on the principle of daily renewal, reviewing the past and planning for the most perfect operational strategy is the most important thing to pay attention to in the future.</p>
<p>The past task of the Central China Revitalization Company focused on revitalizing the war-torn industry of Central China, operating diligently, and laying the foundation, which was a great achievement. From the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War to today, after the National Government's participation in the war, there is an even greater need for resource development and smooth transportation. The company's mission in the future will shift from revitalizing post-war industries to accelerating industrial development to adapt to wartime needs, with the aim of directly contributing to the total war. This is the second point.</p>
<p>We have repeatedly advocated that in the future, to achieve the highest efficiency in handling China's economic affairs, the following principles should be followed: (1) Those that are more beneficial for China to handle on its own than for Japan to handle should be handed over to China; (2) Those that are more beneficial for both China and Japan to handle jointly should be handled jointly by China and Japan; (3) Those that are more beneficial for Japan to handle than for China to handle on its own should still be handled by Japan. Based on the above principles to determine the businesses to be handled, the selection of the main responsible persons must absolutely adopt the principle of talent, this is the third point.</p>
<p>At the reception for reporters yesterday, Mr. Takashima said, "The cooperation between China and Japan should not only be in words or on paper, but also in practical aspects, so that the daily lives and behaviors of the people of the two countries are combined... I am willing to do my best to promote its success." This is the same as our long-held view that the true friendship between the two countries must be based on the feelings of the people, that is, the daily lives and behaviors of the people. We especially hope that Mr. Takashima will do his best to promote its success, this is the fourth point.</p>
<p>Mr. Takashima is one of the most prestigious entrepreneurs in Japan, with rich experience. As the president, he will be more than capable. We are willing to wait and see the future performance of the Central China Revitalization Company.</p>
<h3>Rice for Registered Households in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>The seventh phase of household rice distribution in the western Shanghai district began yesterday (25th). These rice purchase certificates have also been issued to residents by the Lianbao Office a few days ago. It is heard that this household rice is 2.4 sheng per person, and the selling price is 6 yuan and 0.05 fen. The previous rumor that it would be increased to 2.5 sheng is incorrect.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>Fundraising for Fuyouyuan. The Shanghai Fuyouyuan (Children's Welfare Institute) has been fundraising for ten days since it started. There have been many people who have voluntarily donated funds. The current fundraising committee of the institute believes that there are many orphans in the institute and the expenses are huge. It is difficult to achieve the goal without a comprehensive promotion. Therefore, it is planning to organize Yue opera, drama, radio broadcasting, and invite famous Chinese and foreign football teams to participate in a charity match.</p>
<p>Fundraising for the Ciyou Association. Yesterday, according to the Chinese Ciyou Association, the association will hold its annual fundraising campaign for the education and upbringing of orphans in April, but the fundraising target and date have not yet been officially decided. Yesterday's report mistranslated that the Chinese Children's Happiness Association would hold a fundraising campaign.</p>
<h3>Sports: The Donghua vs. Saint Francis Xavier Match is Rescheduled to the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The Italian Navy vs. the Sucor Match is Advanced. According to the temporary notice from the Western Union Secretariat, the order and time of this Sunday (28th) have been slightly adjusted. The two matches in Group A will be switched. The Italian Navy will play Sucor at 10:30 AM, and the Donghua vs. Saint Francis Xavier match will be rescheduled to 3:30 PM, the venue is still Jiaozhou Park. The situation of the previous match between the Jewish team and the Portuguese Merchants in Group A has not changed. The Italian Navy still ranks first, followed by Lianyi, Donghua, Jewish, Portuguese Merchants, Saint Francis Xavier, and Sucor at the bottom.</p>
<h3>Sports Briefs</h3>
<p>The China Youth Amateur Boxing Tournament is scheduled for the semi-finals at 7:30 PM on April 3rd.</p>
<p>Yesterday's report was broadcast at 7:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Mr. Kikujiro Takashima, President of the Central China Revitalization Company, Arrives in Shanghai and Receives Chinese and Japanese Journalists Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mr. Kikujiro Takashima, the newly appointed president of the Central China Revitalization Co., Ltd., has arrived in Shanghai from Tokyo with Vice President Ueba and Secretary Hamada. He received the Japanese press at the Broadway Mansion at 6:00 PM yesterday (25th) and the Chinese press at 6:30 PM, explaining the focus of future operations, saying, "Now that the relationship between China and Japan has returned to its proper state and is striving to move forward on a new track, I am honored to take over the important position of president of the Central China Revitalization Co., Ltd. after my predecessor Mr. Kodama. I feel honored, but I am not capable enough to take on this important task. In the future, I will do my best to follow the government's policies in order to fulfill my duties and mission. As for the cooperation between China and Japan, the Japanese government has always stated this, and recently Prime Minister Tojo visited the National Government, and Chairman Wang also made the same statement. I have no need to repeat it, but I will follow the new policies of the two governments so that the cooperation between China and Japan is not only in words or on paper, but also in practical aspects, so that the daily lives and behaviors of the people of the two countries are combined to create a foundation for permanent cooperation based on mutual trust. Although I am not talented, I am willing to do my best to promote its success. As for the future operations of our company, we will also follow the main points of the government's policy toward China, and strive to respect the Chinese side's capital and creativity. When necessary, we will also make appropriate adjustments to the company's business. After a detailed inspection here, we will consider adapting to the actual situation and handling it well. Therefore, I hope for the guidance of the army and navy and officials and people here, and at the same time, I sincerely hope that the National Government will give its cooperation for favorable progress."</p>

<h3>Economy</h3>
<p>Military scrip is slightly softer. Since the Japanese Ministry of Finance announced that the issuance of new military scrip would be abolished from April and that all public and private payments would be made in savings certificates, its use has inevitably decreased. Inter-dealer trading is slightly lower at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, 3 li, and 4 hao.</p>
<p>The Lianhe Banknote's price rises sharply, breaking through the 4 yuan mark. After the issuance of new military scrip was stopped, its demand increased. Traders bought in from 3 yuan, 9 jiao, 5 fen to 4 yuan, 1 jiao, and sold at 4 yuan, 2 jiao, a rise of 3 jiao and 8 fen.</p>
<h3>Commentary: Preliminary Strengthening of the Central Reserve Bank Note</h3>
<p>The previous commentary focused on how to strengthen the purchasing power of the Central Reserve Bank Note, with strengthening the public's psychological belief in the Central Reserve Bank Note as the decisive factor. Yesterday's news reported that the friendly nation has decided to abolish the issuance of new military scrip from April 1, thereby achieving complete uniformity of currency in Central and Southern China. In other words, the unification performance of the Central Reserve Bank Note has been reaffirmed, which has a great relationship with the stability of finance and the suppression of prices. Such a measure can be said to be a preliminary strengthening of the Central Reserve Bank Note.</p>
<p>Why is it called a preliminary strengthening? Because among the factors that determine the strength of a country's currency, at least two factors are indispensable: one is the currency's liquidity, and the other is the currency's issuance amount. Yesterday's commentary already said that a basic principle cannot be ignored in a concrete plan to strengthen the purchasing power of the Central Reserve Bank Note, that is, the public's psychological belief in the Central Reserve Bank Note must be stabilized and consolidated. If the currency's circulation can be consistent, the public's concerns about the currency's volatility can be eliminated. If the currency's issuance amount is limited, the public's concerns about the currency's inflation can be eliminated. As a result, the public's psychological belief in the currency will be strengthened.</p>
<p>Since the issuance of new military scrip has been stopped, and after April 1, all national treasury expenditures involving military scrip will be converted to Central Reserve Bank Notes; the deposits, loans, and remittances of various banks, money houses, and guilds in various places cannot be paid with military scrip. The liquidity of the Central Reserve Bank Note has become more widespread. Therefore, it is called a preliminary strengthening of the Central Reserve Bank Note. As for further strengthening - that is, the restriction of the issuance amount -, it is at least hoped that the financial authorities can constantly provide the public with open and factual reports, which is what the public most likes to hear.</p>
<h3>Minister Tajiri Issues a Statement After the Issuance of New Military Scrip is Stopped</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai: The fact that the issuance of new military scrip in Central and Southern China will be stopped from April 1 was clarified on the 24th by the authorities of the Japanese Army and Navy Embassy and the Minister of Greater East Asia and the Ministry of Finance. However, some of the public still do not fully understand the significance of this measure and mistakenly believe that the issuance amount of reserve certificates will increase after the issuance of new military scrip is stopped, or that this will cause inflation of the reserve certificates and hold unwarranted worries. Minister Tajiri of the Japanese Embassy Shanghai Office, in view of this, issued a statement on the 25th, stating that the above is purely a misunderstanding. The Chinese and Japanese authorities will take all measures to maintain the price and credit of the reserve certificates and sincerely explain that there is absolutely no worry about inflation of the reserve certificates. The contents of Minister Tajiri's statement are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Since April 1, the issuance of new military scrip has been stopped. The purpose of stopping the issuance of new military scrip, which was officially announced by the Japanese authorities on the 24th, is to complete the work of unifying the currency of Central and Southern China with the Central Reserve Bank notes. The various measures taken to maintain the price of military scrip, such as the sale of imports from Japan, North China, and Manchuria with military scrip, and the sale of local products such as tobacco with military scrip, will henceforth be limited to sale with reserve certificates in order to maintain the value of the reserve certificates. The Japanese side will take all necessary measures to maintain the price of reserve certificates and fully assist the National Government in its currency work. Because the issuance of new military scrip has been stopped, the payments of Japanese military departments and government offices, as well as the payments of bank deposits and loans, will all be made with reserve certificates and no longer use military scrip. The military scrip will be gradually withdrawn, and the reserve certificates, which will replace the military scrip, will have their circulation range expanded.</p>
<p>Although the circulation range of reserve certificates has been expanded after replacing the military scrip that has been circulating, and the circulation amount has increased, this is only to replace the military scrip that was circulating in the past, so the total amount of currency in Central and Southern China has not increased. Moreover, as mentioned just now, the various measures taken by the Japanese side to maintain the value of military scrip will henceforth be used to maintain the value of reserve certificates. The Japanese side will do its best to take necessary measures regarding the maintenance of the value of reserve certificates and will make even greater efforts than before to cooperate with the National Government's currency policy. Therefore, since the issuance of new military scrip has been stopped, the circulation of reserve certificates has increased, which is due to the expansion of the circulation range of reserve certificates, and it is also a sign of the completion of the unification of the currency of Central and Southern China with reserve certificates. Therefore, reserve certificates have now become a unified currency, and their value is becoming more stable. This can be clearly seen from the above points. Reserve certificates have now become the unified currency of Central and Southern China, and the stability of the people's livelihood and the preservation of property in Central and Southern China all depend on the stability of the value of reserve certificates. Therefore, the Japanese side has repeatedly stated that it will cooperate with the National Government in stabilizing the currency value and take measures to cooperate as much as possible, even more effort than in maintaining the value of military scrip in the past.</p>
<p>The ratio of reserve certificates to military scrip has always been set at 18 yuan, and it has been firm since June last year. Since April 1, the ratio of reserve certificates to Japanese yen has also been set at 18 Japanese yen to 100 reserve certificates. This has been announced by the Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia, the Ministry of Finance, and the Army and Navy Embassies in China. In addition, Zhou Fohai, the Minister of Finance of the National Government, has also stated that he will adhere to the 18 yuan exchange rate. Therefore, reserve certificates will be set at 18 yuan for both military scrip and Japanese yen. The policy of adhering to this has been clarified by both the Chinese and Japanese authorities, so the value of reserve certificates will become more stable.</p>
<h3>Readjustment of the City's Economic Bureau and Economic Institutions</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai: In order to comply with the wartime economic policy guidelines promulgated by the National Government on February 13 this year, the Shanghai Special Municipality Economic Bureau has decided to readjust and reorganize all old economic institutions in the city that are not suitable for the wartime economic system. It is heard that the bureau regards industrial and commercial groups in the city as a type of economic institution. In order to actively readjust the economic institutions in the city, all joint associations, business offices, trade associations, and other similar organizations in the city that have not been approved in the past must report to the bureau before April 10 for verification and handling. It is hoped that all industrial and commercial groups in the city will comply with this and not delay.</p>
<h3>Circulation of Materials Expedited, Transit Tax Revenue Will Increase</h3>
<p>After the establishment of the National Commercial Control Council, it was stipulated that permits must be obtained for the removal of 12 categories of goods such as cotton yarn and cloth, and for the import of rice, wheat, etc. Goods not subject to the permit system are allowed to be transported freely within the peaceful area. Therefore, various industries in Shanghai are quite active. As a result, the transit tax collected by the Jianghai Customs branches has increased significantly. The reason for this is that the establishment of the National Commercial Control Council has expedited the circulation of materials. According to this trend, transit tax revenue can be further increased in the future, and the previous tendency of materials to be concentrated can also be alleviated. The agencies for collecting transit tax are the various customs and their branches, totaling 24 as of March 20.</p>
<h3>Hua Zhong Tobacco Allocation. Distribution of Goods Implemented Yesterday. Collection by Card Ends Tomorrow</h3>
<p>After the Hua Zhong Tobacco Allocation Association applied to the authorities to announce the fair prices of cigarettes, the unified allocation has been prepared and the first phase of distribution was implemented yesterday. The goods distributed are temporarily limited to the goods produced by the military-managed Zhongyan Company and the Japanese-owned Zhonghua Tobacco Company. The allocation method adopts a 1, 2, 3, 4 system, based on the ABCD ratings of the cigarette retail stores (for example, A is allocated 4 packs of cigarettes, B is allocated 3 packs, C is allocated 2 packs, and D is allocated 1 pack). Collection is made with the previously issued allocation card. (1) 300 large wholesalers collect from the designated distribution points. (2) More than 5,000 small wholesalers collect from the designated large wholesalers, and the deadline is March 27. As for the distribution of Huacheng, Nanyang, Datong, Fuxin, and Dadongnan and other Chinese factories, due to procedural reasons, it will be implemented on March 29 (Monday). The authorities are responsible for strictly implementing the cigarette price limit, and violators will be severely punished. Therefore, from yesterday, all cigarette stores have sold in accordance with the price limit, but the quantity purchased is limited to one or two small packs.</p>
<h3>Translated Commentary: New Development in Currency Policy</h3>
<p>The Japanese side has always actively cooperated in the circulation and strengthening of the Central Reserve Bank Note. Its circulation area is expanding day by day, and its currency value is extremely stable. This time, the Japanese authorities have decided to stop issuing new military scrip, and the Central Reserve Bank Note has become the only currency in Central and Southern China. Its status is becoming more and more important.</p>
<p>Stopping the issuance of new military scrip aims to gradually create a monetary system with the Central Reserve Note as the sole currency. There is no change in the economic sector, and economic operations can still proceed smoothly. The monetary system will be unified in the short term. In the future, the military and government authorities will no longer pay with military scrip, and all deposits and remittances will be made with Central Reserve Notes. It goes without saying that the authorities' policies are appropriate and thorough.</p>
<p>In the past five years, military scrip has completed major tasks. The currency war against the old legal tender and the work of assisting the Central Reserve Note's circulation have all accomplished indelible achievements. At present, the task has been completed and the period of unifying the currency system has been reached. However, we still need cooperation between officials and the people to make the best efforts to ensure that the military scrip has a beginning and an end, and reaches the stage of successful retirement. (Yunpeng: Translated from the March 25th edition of the Continental New Daily)</p>
<h3>Rice Production in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces: Ministry of Food Establishes Production and Sales Office in Jiangsu</h3>

The position of Director is concurrently held by Hu Zheng, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry.</p>
<p>Investigation of Last Year's Grain Production - After the establishment of the Ministry of Food, in order to understand the annual production and sales of rice, flour, and miscellaneous grains in the provinces, cities, and counties under its jurisdiction last year, the Ministry issued a general order to the grain administration organs of various provinces and cities to report detailed information immediately for reference. Upon receiving the order, the Municipal Grain Administration Bureau immediately instructed its subordinate districts to report accurately.</p>
<h3>A Look at the Past and Present of the China Commercial Bank (1)</h3>
<p>— Jian Zhi</p>
<p>"Finance is the hub of all industries." This is not only a common saying in society but also a generally recognized economic fact. In the eyes of the people, economic stability is synonymous with financial stability; the two are different in name but the same in essence. The Chinese government has always believed that stabilizing finance is equivalent to stabilizing the economy, and all economic measures should start with finance. Given the importance attached to finance in the economy, it is only natural that banks, as the most important institutions in finance, are regarded as the hub of all industries.</p>
<p>In Chinese economic history, banks have indeed been the hub of the economy, and their power has not only influenced economic activities but also formed the backbone of political power. This was especially true before the "August 13th Incident," before the implementation of the legal tender policy. The China Commercial Bank possessed the largest amount of capital in the economic sector and was the sole trustee of general social savings. At that time, industrial and commercial enterprises with capital exceeding several hundred thousand yuan were already considered large enterprises, while larger commercial banks had deposits of over ten million yuan. Due to the disparity in financial strength, and in the absence of direct investment interest in society, industrial and commercial enterprises had no choice but to rely on banks for turnover, allowing banks to manipulate the economy through the power of finance.</p>
<p>Moreover, since the founding of the Republic of China, governments have often resorted to borrowing as a simple way to manage finances due to financial difficulties. Banks, as holders of large amounts of capital, naturally became creditors. Politicians and bankers often supported each other, actively participating in the political arena, thus establishing a close relationship between banks and politics. This was the golden age of the China Commercial Bank. After the establishment of the Nationalist Government, the situation changed slightly, but the economy continued to require the assistance of banks. Therefore, although their power diminished, they remained influential as before.</p>

<h3>Fear and Life</h3>
<p>— Xiao Lin</p>
<p>From a beneficial perspective, "fear" is an indispensable psychological medicine for the "life," motivating progress. Whoever fears the punishment of the law will avoid committing crimes. Whoever fears hunger will work hard. Whoever fears getting sick will take care of their body and pay attention to hygiene. Whoever fears being ridiculed by others will strive to improve and prove themselves... These kinds of fears are all necessary for life.</p>
<p>However, from another perspective, the failure of many people is also due to fearing everything, which leads them to hesitate in any undertaking, destroying all self-confidence, enthusiasm, creativity, and decisiveness. "Fear" makes them feel that everyone around them is looking for their faults to criticize. "Fear" makes them feel that all things are filled with difficulties that human power cannot overcome. In this way, fear will forever control their will, preventing them from ever achieving balance, until "death," when they are still afraid that "death" will cause them pain.</p>
<p>How unfortunate, how many people have been buried alive by fear.</p>
<p>Fear is mostly expanded from one's own personal thoughts. They lock the enemy in their own hearts, allowing it to wreak havoc freely.</p>
<p>To cure this psychological problem, one's own wisdom is the best medicine. Only clear wisdom can dispel the fear in one's heart and cleanse the mind of fear. To prevent fear from acting up, take direct action, forget fear, and prevent your spirit from being entangled by the environment. "Calmly" and freely engage in creative efforts, without fearing failure. The important thing is to strive to correct shortcomings.</p>
<p>Conquering fear is the only way to embark on the path to success. If you allow fear to grow in your life, it is tantamount to slow suicide.</p>
<h3>Rainy Day</h3>
<p>— Ya Qi</p>
<p>It's raining in the street. The rain isn't heavy, it only wets the center of the street, and a few drops fall on the window curtains. The slight sound doesn't disturb me. I feel that the rain should have come long ago. Lovely rain, it's spring. A few raindrops can irrigate the budding new leaves and moisten the hearts and lungs of people who have gone through the severe winter. It's the gentle drizzle.</p>
<p>When I was in Sichuan, I lived in Rongyu for two years. Although that place isn't as beautiful and gorgeous as Jiangnan, I have a bias towards liking that place because there is a pleasant rainy day.</p>
<p>"Western Sichuan Plain" is a flat basin with a very mild climate. Rain rarely shows its cruel methods in this happy place, whether it's pouring down or dropping like pearls. It's also the weather after spring. The rain becomes a close friend of the people. I hate that the streets of Rongcheng are dusty, but the rain often makes up for it. It's very clever, it only wets the flying road dust and then leaves with the dark clouds. The face of the sun is smiling again. I rarely have a hard time with the dark clouds when I go out. At night, there are probably a few days without rain. It will be interesting to drop for a while. The sound of rain is detected in the leaking tube, hitting the banana leaves in the courtyard, clear and full of poetic rhythm. Sometimes I wake up from a dream and think that I should go to Shao City Park for tea tomorrow morning!</p>
<p>After a night of washing, the yellow dirt road in Shao City Park is very easy to walk on. Its characteristic is that it's soft, but it doesn't wet your soles. Sipping light tea in a rattan chair in "Jiminglou," watching the small creek flowing beside you, the water is overflowing, flowing very fast in a grayish yellow color. The evergreen trees as long as the gallery are washed so smooth by the rain? There are not many water droplets left on the leaves. The children selling newspapers and groceries went upstairs. The clock tower in the imperial city struck, nine o'clock, I went downstairs with a stack of newspapers.</p>
<p>However, I also lived in the nearby countryside for a short time. The rain here didn't give me a good impression. It became an annoying thing. The country's yellow dirt road has no sand. After the rain, it all becomes a muddy road. Chicken carts can't carry people. We have to walk barefoot into the city. If we're not careful, we often slip down the fields.</p>
<p>Staying in Kunming for the autumn is also a rainy season. The rain and I have a sense of intimacy again. I describe it as a beautiful rain angel.</p>
<p>Everything is very strange. I believe that the rain will not be blamed by the residents of Kunming. It's called a "rainy season", but this is different from the tropical "rainy season". It doesn't rain for a few days, and it doesn't cause floods. It has a very rich storage capacity. The fine rain silk floats, floats on the faces of pedestrians, and who will care about it.</p>
<p>While I was there, I spent a lot of money to buy a raincoat, so every time I went into the city from "Daguanlou," I always wore it. I realized that the people of Kunming despise "rain," and I felt that it was very beautiful.</p>
<p>Here, in Shanghai, the rain has stopped early, and a car drives by, a burst of water sound, I really hate the sound. Rain is indeed a double-edged thing. I love it, and I hate it equally.</p>
<h3>Roots</h3>
<p>— Xin Bo</p>
<p>There is a road, going along Wangjiajing. The water in Wangjiajing has risen a lot because of the rain for a few days. In some places, there are patches of algae, scattered in patches, and in some places, there are newly born wild water caltrops, floating in plates. Schools of small fish shuttle back and forth between their roots and leaves.</p>
<p>After passing Wangjia Village, A-Wu soon arrived at the foot of Little Ling Mountain. The only road up the mountain is the larger and flatter one in the center, so everyone takes this central path, and people are crowded together. But the crowd doesn't make A-Wu unhappy, but increases his happiness. So many people, how lively. How many times a year is the lively scene! He knows how to cherish this opportunity.</p>
<p>Although his feet are very strong, and the mountain is not high, and he can reach the top in a few steps, he walks very slowly, and often looks back at the scenery at the foot of the mountain. He can see the entire view of Chongwen Town at a glance. It extends east and west along the long river, also two or three li away. The dense houses, white walls, and black roofs reflect each other. Because it is after the rain, it is like a landscape painting that has just been brushed, the colors are not dry yet, and there is some damp meaning.</p>
<p>He found it interesting, so he simply left the surging crowd and stood next to a rose field. This field is enclosed on the hillside. The yellow soil is planted with clusters of roses, which are almost the same as the tea mountains in Hangzhou. The roses have already formed buds, and when the weather is clear, they will bloom red petals.</p>
<p>Next to the rose field, there are a few mulberry fields. The mulberry branches have already sprouted leaves, and the light yellow color is somewhat like the newly born leaves on the willow branches a month or two ago. A-Wu suddenly felt interested in them, like meeting an old acquaintance in a foreign land, so he stopped looking at the distance and instead focused on them. He remembered the scene of his family raising silkworms when his parents were alive. (20)</p>
<h3>Third Place in the February Essay Contest: How to Read? What to Read?</h3>
<p>— Xie Tingxin</p>
<p>(1) How to Read?</p>
<p>(A) How to Obtain Books. Currently, the production of new books has decreased drastically, the import of foreign books has been cut off, and book prices are dozens of times higher than before the war. Ordinary people's purchasing power is already inadequate. The only way is to open up other channels:</p>
<p>(1) Utilize Libraries. Utilizing libraries is the most economical principle of "obtaining maximum utility at the smallest cost." (2) Borrow Books from Relatives and Friends. As long as you return them on time and cherish the books. (3) Browse Used Bookstores. First, you can get books at a low price, and second, you can get books that are out of print. (4) Exchange Books. Allow those in need and those who supply to get what they need, eliminating middlemen from profiting.</p>
<p>(B) What Attitude Should You Have When Reading?</p>
<p>(1) Have a Skeptical Attitude. Mencius said: "To believe everything in books is worse than having no books at all." Every writer has his era background and his personal views. Readers should analyze them, why blindly follow them? (2) Do Not Read for Entertainment. The Japanese writer Lafcadio Hearn said: "Although London publishes more than 6,000 books every year, very few people actually read. They buy books for entertainment, just like what they call 'leisure.'" I think this situation is very common in our country as well. Reading for entertainment only results in the intoxication of the mind and destroys the ability to think. (3) Read to Enrich Life. Dr. Hutchins, former president of the University of Chicago, said, "The lives of people with higher education are the most fulfilling. They can enjoy and appreciate many things that wealth cannot buy." Reading is educating yourself, to achieve the goal of enriching life.</p>
<p>(C) When and Where to Read?</p>
<p>(1) Utilize Spare Time to Read. The accumulation of many short periods of time will quickly exceed the entire teaching time of university education. (2) Read Anywhere. Japanese and Americans also read on the train. Their spirit is worthy of emulation. We must develop a constant reading habit in the changing free time of life.</p>
<p>(D) How to Read?</p>
<p>(1) Recognize the Author's Background. Recognize the various backgrounds in which the author is located before reading their text. (2) Grasp the Central Idea. Grasp the central idea, and the entire logic will be solved. (3) Find the Main Sentence of Each Paragraph. Find the main sentence, and the logic will be clear. (4) Underline. Underline the essence of the full text or the main theme to clarify the outline. (5) Read a good book more than once.</p>
<p>(2) What to Read?</p>
<p>(A) Read Books that Have Been Rigorously Tested by Time. To avoid wasting energy, only read the best books. The greatest critic of books is society. The fame of famous books is not created by a few critics, but by the accumulation of centuries of human opinion. Sometimes we cannot understand the advantages of great works praised for centuries. But after careful study, you will eventually understand the reasons for the praise. The essential value hidden in famous books will never pass, but will reveal new meanings due to the progress of the reader's personal life experience.</p>
<p>(B) Read Books that are Related to Our Lives. All frivolous, ethereal, and imaginary books do not need to be read. These are of no benefit other than anesthesia. A person's life is multifaceted. Basic books in each category of life must be read to make life full of vitality and not fall behind.</p>
<p>(C) Read Books Towards Your Own Aspirations.</p>
<p>The British scientist John Lubbock wrote a "List of World Classics," with a hundred literary classics. Other scholars have also proposed different classics. Now that time has passed, and these classics tables have become worthless. In short, each person has different goals, and only by deciding on a reading list according to their aspirations. Choose the best ones to study. It is better to be specialized than broad.</p>
<p>(D) Read Biographies of Successful People. Many people have read biographies of successful people, been inspired, and achieved great careers in one fell swoop. Success is not accidental. There is a certain path to follow. Whether you aspire to be in politics, business, industry, or agriculture, biographies of successful people can indicate the path to success and the elements of success. Use a scientific mind to analyze, and never read it like a novel!</p>

<h3>The Needy New Pututang Shelter Awaiting Rescue</h3>
<p>— You Zhu</p>
<p>The largest refugee shelter in Shanghai is the New Pututang Shelter on Guohuo Road in the Nanshi district, founded by the Catholic friend Mr. Lu Bohong. For 30 years, it has been sheltering the elderly, weak, disabled, orphans, and widows, requiring annual funding of two million yuan. Because there is no fixed fund, the annual expenses rely on the annual assistance of local charitable organizations, or donations from foreign churches and individuals, to maintain it until now. With the prices of all things rising, it is even more difficult. The enthusiasm and perseverance of the person in charge for charity can be imagined. Yesterday, we received a letter from Dean Yu Keqin: "Our hall currently cares for 202 elderly men and women, 136 disabled people, 432 orphans, 156 poor and sick people, and 111 refugees, totaling 1,037 people. Each person eats five he of rice per day, and the monthly rice consumption is 150 dan. Due to insufficient funds, food and clothing are sometimes in danger of not being provided. Last year, thanks to your enthusiasm for charity, you appealed loudly in the newspapers, and you received sympathy and assistance from great philanthropists in society, who generously donated funds. The people in the hall were deeply grateful. Recently, prices have skyrocketed endlessly, and expenses have increased sharply, making funding even more difficult. If we don't urgently seek remedies, then more than a thousand elderly and weak people will inevitably become starving corpses. Therefore, we specially request your newspaper to continue to provide assistance, and we respectfully ask people from all walks of life to pity the poor and care for orphans, generously donate funds, whether cash or goods, to enable the poor people in the hall to rely on sustenance for their lives. (Editor's note: All people of integrity cannot bear to sit idly by and watch the death of compatriots. This office will do its best to inform the public and hopes that all sectors can visit in person and provide financial assistance to save these orphans and widows. The collection points are: (1) Jihua Hall, (2) Huamei Pharmacy, (3) Yangjingbang Catholic Church, (4) Silk Industry Bank. After receiving the funds and goods, the above-mentioned places will hand them over to the hall for public announcement to show great faith.)</p>
