<h3 id="c1">再獻言於友邦日本經濟使節團 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>友邦經濟使節團抵滬以後，本報曾以中國人民的立塲，率先提出幾點對於中國當前經濟問題的意見，繼之以陳述吾國經濟病源和病態。使節團來華的使命是對於一兩國經濟提携作具體的懇談，充分接受中國人士的意見」，無疑的使節團還要將懇談的結果，作成報吿，以備日本政府的採擇。因此，我們很願藉此機會，盡情披露意見，以供使節團建議調整中日經濟關係的參考。同時，希望使節團能將我們的意見，毫無隱飾的轉達於日本的朝野。</p>
<p>中日兩大民族，在歷史上，地理上，語言文字上，均有其不可分離之原因在，尤其在白色人種始終不免歧視有色人種情况之下，中日兩大民族，更應密切團結。以海陸空軍備而言，日本誠然遠勝中國，可是在人力物力方面，中國却超過日本。故從國防經濟着想，中日兩國合則兩美，離則兩傷。東亞民族怎樣纔能取得東亞主人翁的地位，除非是中日兩大民族精誠合作，這是任何日本人或中國人所不能否認的事實。</p>
<p>因爲中日兩大民族各有其立國之優點，因爲中日兩大民族一經聯合，足以控制全亞洲，最低限度亦可驅逐英美侵略勢力於東亞範圍以外，所以嫉忌者不惜用盡種種方法，來挑撥離間中日間的情感，不幸這種挑撥離間的詭計，竟然得售，使中日兩國在人力物力上均蒙受了重大的損失。要不是，使英美陰謀揭穿也牽入戰事旋渦以內，豈非中日的力量互消，便是英美的勢力滋長，一消一長之間，東亞民族，更不知淪落至何等地位。</p>
<p>自從大東亞戰事發生以至中國參戰以後，日本對華政策已有顯著的轉變，從此兩國人民果能澈底消除以往誤會，進而密切合作，以從事於東亞經濟之開發，不特中日兩國繁榮可期，即東亞其他民族，亦將咸受其利。</p>
<p>過去中日經濟衝突之原因，由於日本是十個工業國家，同時中國也有積極向工業發展的傾向，從表面觀察，中國的工業發展，對於日本顯然不利，可是經過澈底硏究以後，這種對立的現象，根本不能成立。因爲中國地大物博，人口稠密，在生產和消費方面，都有大量增加的可能。過去中國生產和消費的貧乏，是由於國民經濟力量的薄弱。其原因則由於外受英美經濟侵略的壓迫，內受頻年內亂之影響，今後各種障礙旣除國民經濟狀况當然可以好轉，同時生產與消費亦顯然可以隨之增加，何况今後東亞資源和市塲，巳完全操之於東亞各民族掌握之中，原料和市塲根本不成問題，故以往之衝突與對立之現象，已無繼續存在的可能。</p>
<p>基於以上觀察，改善中國國民經濟，不僅是解決中國未來經濟問題，同時也聯帶解決日本未來經濟問題，在這種塲合之下，兩國人民都應抱定一種助人即所以自助之心理。</p>
<p>我們今日第一項要請求使節團幫助我們解決的是安定金融問題。因爲金融不安定，一切生產建設，都無從談起。囤積的猖獗和物價的暴漲，更無法退止。安定金融的方法：（一）要使財政收支平衡，從消極方面言，應該减少不必要之軍政費支出，裁撤或合併各項駢枝機關，從積極方面言，應該切實整頓現有各項稅收，嚴禁中飽，同時推行遺產稅，過分利得稅，以充實國庫之收入，萬一仍有不敷，祗可以發行公債爲抵補，絕對不可增發紙幣，以免牽動通貨之信用。（二）維持中日物資交流與貿易之平衡，使因收購物資而流入民間之通貨，仍得回籠，以免形成膨脹。（三）由政府積極倡導國內金融界企業界聯合開發各項企業，俾可導納游資於正途。（四）公開監督中央儲備銀行發行業務，不得爲發展生產以外之發行，並設法逐漸充實其準備。以上各項，雖然大半皆屬中國本身問題，可是因爲使節團中都是日本國內余融經濟界的權威，從中日經濟提携立塲而言，協助調整，亦是義不容辭的事。</p>
<p>其次我們要提出者是民食問題。中國雖然號稱以農立國，可是由於農民智識幼稚，　業技術落後，所以一面還要仰仗米麥麵粉之輸人來抵補民食的不足。中日事變以後，農村愈見衰落，農產愈見减少，因此民食問題，益見嚴重。至如大都市間之民食問題，因爲又增加了一項遝輸關係，所以格外嚴重。目前上海米價已等於中日事變前之一百五十倍，倘不急圖補救，工商各業皆將同歸於盡。治本辦法，要我們自己去辦的是安定農村秩序，發展農村金融，使一切農產物，都可以逐漸增加。治標方法，希望友邦幫同我們解決的第一是國內米糧運輸問題．近來米價的高漲，不完全關係米糧之有無，而繫於來源之暢滯。祗要主持交通的當局，特別注意此點，無論何時何地，對於米糧運輸，均能提前辦理，不使稍有停滯。間接就可以幫助米價的穩定。第二是合理收購糧食問題。向農村區城收購糧食，其價格務必按照生產成本，合理規定，俾農民樂於以所餘出售。這兩點不但從經濟合作言，日本應該幫助中國，就是從人類同情方面言，也似乎不容澳視。</p>
<p>以上兩點，皆爲中日經濟提携所應急須解決的問題，所以我們首先提出具體意見。至其他有關各項問題，還待繼續提出，我們總希望考察團能以藥到病除的方法，來拯起我們的沉疴。</p>

<p>東京九日中央社電　日大本營九日下午三時卅分發表：日海軍航空部隊，七月七日進擊進止於新佐治亞島孟達南方魯比亞納（Robiana）島之敵軍，使其陣地發生大火，並於該地上空擊落敵戰鬥機卅一架，日機四架尙未返防。</p>
<p>東京九日中央社電　美軍一部於六月三日在倫特巴島登陸後，即繼續企圖在新佐治亞島西北岸之庫拉灣上陸，然爲日大本營七日所發表者，在此次庫拉灣夜戰申，敵軍已蒙極大打擊。而敵軍又在有計劃中進抵倫特巴島與新佐治亞島中間之魯比亞納島，進行構築陣地，欲使該地成爲立足基地，但日本海軍航空部隊於發現敵方企圖後，立即猛擊該處敵軍陣地，各處均中彈發生大火，將其擊破，予以極大　擊。又日海軍機是日在該處上空亦與敵戰鬥機數十架展開猛烈大空戰，結果擊落敵機半數共三十一架，獲得莫大戰果，而創三十一對四之光輝記錄。</p>
<h3 id="c3">德蘇機械兵團　展開主力戰　情况激烈近頂點 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　德軍當局九日發表：德軍在貝爾格勒·奥萊海地區，共擊落蘇軍飛機八十架，故自該方面作戰開始以來，德軍已擊落敵機在二六二架以上。</p>
<p>瑞與京城九日中央社電　據倫敦電，英電訊交換通信社莫斯科特派員稱：奥萊爾·庫斯克地區之戰事，仍在進展中，現尙不能判斷其歸趨，奧萊爾與貝爾格勒間之戰綫，正展開大消耗戰，蘇軍已出動空前之大量戰車·飛機·德軍亦於此教十公里之戰綫上，以數百輛之戰車集團猛攻蘇軍，消息靈通方面戰測。戰事已日趨熾烈，至十日左右將達其極端。</p>
<p>瑞典京城九日中央社電　據合衆社莫斯科電訊：德國現正以從來未有之最大鐵甲部隊，加入目前之鉗形陣勢，其目的係在包抄庫斯克突出點之四十萬蘇軍並殲滅之，莫斯科方面正式承認，德軍現以六坦克車師團、一糜托化師團及八個步兵師團，合計二〇六·五〇〇人及坦克一三〇〇輛攻擊奧萊爾。庫斯克附近鉗形運動之北翼，而以九坦克車師團與六個步兵師團，合計二十萬人及坦克車一千八百輛進攻貝爾格勒之鉗形南翼。</p>
<p>德使用坦克車　擴大突破缺口</p>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　海通社訊：昨爲庫斯克戰事之第四日，雙方各以大量生力軍助戰，故戰事益趨激烈，蘇軍雖已出動距戰綫較遠之生力軍，惟尙保留一部份之坦克車隊，德軍方面亦然，故戰事之最高度尙未到達。蘇軍司令已下令死守，其部下爲服從命令計，不惜任何代價，在地面要塞勉力堅守，因此蘇軍在人力與物力上之損失，正在大量增加中。星期四戰事之中心，位於貝爾格勒以北六十公里處與奥萊爾以南二十公里處之二點，蘇軍企圖减輕其側面所遭之壓力，在奥萊爾至貝爾格勒戰綫突出處之中段進攻未逞，此類行動若與奧萊爾與貝爾格勒區之戰爭相較，殊無重要之意義，蘇軍反攻之目的，在擊退德軍，然後突破德軍陣地，但無成就。反之，德軍已擴大突破之缺口，深入敵境，德軍使用坦克車向北推進，其數量之多，爲此次戰爭中各戰塲從來所未有。庫斯克半圓形陣地之地形，頗適坦克車之爲用，德軍坦克車利用此優點，迅速向敵軍壓迫，蘇軍坦克軍之損失，較德軍之損失超過數倍之多，其原因有三：（一）德軍之虎型坦克車較優於蘇軍首次使用之「一〇三四」型之坦克車，（二）德軍使用新式與最有威力之反坦克車武器，（三）德國空軍在空中佔有優勢，使德軍可使用大量飛機襲擊蘇軍坦克車隊與其要塞砲位，蘇軍所損失之坦克車，百分之二十爲英，美所造，其中包括美國自誇之「希爾曼將軍」「葛蘭特將軍」及「李將軍」等型之坦克車多輛。德·蘇雙方損失飛機之比率爲一對十五，足見德國空軍之優勢。</p>
<h3 id="c4">大軍爭奪寸土　戰局呈全面化 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>瑞典京城九日中央社電　據莫斯科電：東綫德軍干莫斯科西北之加里寳地區已再度展開攻勢、數度猛撲蘇軍陣地，又傳德蘇　軍于羅斯托夫西方之米沃茲河沿岸地區亦開始激烈砲戰。另據柏林電稱：列寗格勒地區之德軍沿岸砲台。突猛轟列寗格勒市之蘇軍陣地，碼頭及工廠地帶，故目軍東綫戰局已呈全而化，同時，德·蘇兩軍于庫斯克突出地帶所展開之九攻防戰、刻日趨猛烈，雙方于北起奥萊爾，南至貝爾格勒綿延二百七十公里之戰綫間，結集大軍二百萬，作寸土爭奪之死搏。據德軍當局稱：德軍目前已粉碎蘇軍攻勢，並指出德軍爲適應戰局之進展，有展間攻勢之可能。另據莫斯科消息、德軍刻自奥萊爾。貝爾格勒兩側面央攻庫斯克大突出地區之蘇軍，而關進行包圍殲滅戰。按前綫消息，德軍自八日起，即不斷出動新銳預備軍，增强攻勢，故今後東綫戰局將更益擴大。目前德軍攻勢之主力，仍置于奥萊爾雨方及貝爾格勒之北方兩地區。據八日前綫消息稱：德軍于空軍掩護下。出動數百輛之戰車集團，擴大蘇軍陣地之突破口，致庫斯克四北區之蘇軍大部隊陷于孤立狀態中。德·蘇兩軍之大規模戰車會戰。已形成空前之大規模機械化戰爭。</p>
<h3 id="c5">駐華日軍　發表一週戰况 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電　日駐華派遣軍七月九日發表一週戰况如次：日中國派遣軍在過去一年間之綜合戰果中。其最堪注目者，厥爲渝軍俘虜及歸順者，合計共達二十四萬五千人，較之前年同期約增三倍，其他加截獲大砲數量約增二倍，重輕機檢數量約增一倍半，槍械數量增加三倍，於此可見渝軍自武器輸入路綫斷絕以來，其戰意已大爲低落。又渝方之已喪失抗戰名目。現渝軍離去之激增，已更可證明，至駐渝美空軍於本月七日曾以二十餘架戰鬥轟炸聯合編馬，盲炸廣州一帶當被日機擊落兩架，餘即遁走，駐渝美空軍最近似積極企圖空襲日軍占領地區，刻正努力增强飛機數量，並儲積燃油，如渝方之蹇陵梁山等空軍基地，　已完全在美軍勢力之下。又有可注目者，即美空軍現已拋棄過去之遊擊戰鬥，而有在正面向日空軍挑戰之勢，至渝軍方空軍最近似伏處於四川腹地，此種現象或因駐美空軍冷淡渝空軍，不予接濟之故，於此亦可見駐渝美空軍欲圖削弱渝空軍力量，以便將其置於自已支配下之野心。</p>
<p>廣州九日中央社電　日中國方面船隊海南部隊爲謀澈底殲滅海南島一帶殘敵，自去年來即開始從事分輥擊減之作戰，緣於去歲十一月下旬始擊滅盤據於該島東北部之共產軍後，復於本年初開始掃蕩殘存於該島西北部一帶敵匪，日陸戰隊精銳於海軍機協力下，從事奇襲，予敵重創，及至國府參戰，與日軍進駐廣州灣後，敵軍乃頓失戰意，如八日日大本營之發表敵棄屍近百具，被俘千人，投誠三千六百餘，足蹬敵匪已悉形潰減，此次之討伐戰，歷時二百數十餘日、前後戰鬥逵六千數百餘次，收獲莫大戰果，目前日軍已佈成堅因壁壘，故敵之游擊戰，已毫不得逞。</p>
<p>太原九日中央社電　日軍各部隊，對晋省渝共軍殘部，刻正澈底進行肅淸中。六月份之綜合戰果：計共交戰三六五次，渝共軍交戰兵力的計三一　五四五人，遺屍一二八八具，俘虜六四人，投降九人，日軍截獲對戰車砲四門，輕機槍二五挺，步槍四四七枝，無綫電機二架，及其他戰利品等甚夥，並復滅其兵營一三處，糧秣庫一處。</p>

<p>南京九日中央社電　日昨中央社記者往訪糧食部次長周乃文氏，承接見談糧政情形如次：</p>
<p>（問）中央儲糧局成立之意義及其下層機構組織如何？何時可正式成立？（答）中央儲糧局之設置，其主旨在加强統一收購，適合戰時體制，使業務與行政完全劃分，一切措施，側重於經濟化商業化，俾得購儲充分之食糧。以資安定民食確保軍糈。其組織暫行條例。已奉行政院會議通過，現正積極籌備，期於七月問正式成立，其下層機構，以各產區米糧聯營社，爲唯一收買機關，由聯營社社員分赴各鄕村，蒐集米穀，繳解於儲糧局，聽候糧食部配給命令，轉運於各銷地，因此將來儲糧局爲督促收買，核發證照，調度資金，檢査價格，並辦理騐收運輸事務，以就各統一征購區域，推設分局或辦事處，以專責成而利業務。（問）京市六月份下旬公糶米未能如期配給，其原因何在？（答）京市公糶米供給責屬粉食部，配給責歸市政府，自來按期配給，中央與地方均極注意，故京市民食夙稱安定，至六月下句公糶米早經塡出發米通知，其所以稍緩配給者，因中旬搭發麵粉，係屬初辦手續與機構力求周密。未免稍需時日，遂致配給六月下旬公糶米連帶延期，現已定期發售，即七月份上旬發米通知，亦經全數塡出矣。（問）日來食米缺乏，故一部份配給麵粉，也京市私米充斥，私抬售價，擾亂糧政，未知糧食部有何具體取締計劃？（答）　年至　黃不接時期，米榖來源缺乏，係屬常有現象，糧念部因此早有準備，搭發麵粉，即所以實施　節盈虛，節約消耗之政策，至京市近來私米固未絕跡，充斥已屬過去，現在私米之來路大　由於數月以前，各囤戶陸續國積，茲以米價高漲，而新榖又將登塲，遂急急爭求出籠，發現市上，本部取締之方，仍不外乎厲行緝政，業已將南京輯私區城劃爲內圍與外圍，以市區爲內圍，完全交由糧食局負責緝私，以江灣江浦渘水句容各縣屬爲外圍，由糧食部佈設稽査所常駐査緝，並由各縣政府組織緝私隊，協同負責辦理，一方面注意於私運路綫，嚴防出境。一方面注重於境內之囤戶，至必要時，即行挨戶搜査，各囤戶如能早日抑價投資於公家，或可寬免其處分。（問）蘇省各縣米價，邇來騰漲，購買困難，此種情形當屬過渡，惟一般人民不明眞相，當局似宜加以具體的解釋，以安民衆。（答）蘇省各縣米價，近來雖見高漲，但暗盤尙未突出千元之關，其最大原因，由於一般物價突然飛漲，無論農民或商人號中有未者，鑒於支出　擔加重，不免　增於　價，向來市塲習價，物價視米價爲漲落，近年米價轉受物價之牽動，本末倒置，前所未見，是由於一般貨物尙未能完全予以强化之統制，一緊一　，途演戲今日特殊之現象，現在全國商業統制總會成立，其下層機構，亦已組織完備，對於與米穀最有連繫性之麥粉雜糧，均另組專業委員會。各種主要農工商品、不久將完全歸納於張化統制之下，供需粗應調節有方，其物價自能漸上軌道，得其平衡，彼時米價當然可恢復其特殊性，發揮其自主之能力。供求其不傷農，不害耕，而米價可永得馳驅於水平綫上矣，儀茲靑黃不接時期，存底見稀，奸商操縱，亦爲漲價之一因，本部對於過渡時期已作充分準備，且蘇幫各縣早稻，尙有一月，便可登塲，接濟民食，故目前蘇省各縣民食絕對不成問題。</p>

<p>維希九日中央社電　海通社訊：據此間昨日接獲消息，馬丁尼克首府夫龍斯堡之街道上，曾發生示威運動，主張與阿爾及爾之法國國民解放委員會聯合，此項示威運動一部份已發展至公開　變之程度，存有法蘭四銀行黃金準備之某堡壘，傳亦已被叛變份子佔據。該島總督洛貝特上將與美政府間之緊張，已因該島之發生不安而更甚，此問法外交部昨晨接獲洛貝特電報兩通，或可對該處之狀况有所闡明，法外部現正草擬關於該島之公吿，或將官式宣吿馬丁尼克脫離維希。據特立尼達西班矛港接獲消息，示威運動起於六月二十四日法，德休戰紀念日，叛衆領袖數人雖已被捕，但秩序尙未恢復，被派往討伐叛黨之軍隊，亦公然同情於叛黨，故洛貝特之地位極爲困難。華盛頓消息亦證實馬丁尼克尙未與解放委員會聯合，此間消息靈通方面力言：李勞在赴美途中，並未在馬丁尼克停留，即可見該島之局勢尙未澄淸，該方而又預言，洛貝特必將屈服於叛離份子。</p>

<p>中國國民外交促進會爲歡迎日駐華大使谷正之氏，特於谷大使蒞滬之便，於昨（九）日下午四時，假興亞大樓工商聯誼會會義應舉行盛大茶會，谷大使準時蒞會，並到溫院長宗堯，褚外長民誼，吳大使凱聲，湯大使良禮，陳大使濟成，夏部長奮峯，周珏·暨聞蘭亭·袁　登·林康侯·張一鵬·孫理甫·陳紹　·李權時·葉雪松·袁厚之·薛逢元·顏晋卿·吳藝麽·金宗成·陳日平·陳亞夫·周邦俊·顏福慶·項康元·顏加保·籢慶祥·竹森生·沈叔玉·陳伯藩·顧南羣·業扶霄·鄭鴻彥·藍森·王永康·王雨齋·雷顯之等，及日本方面大使　太田悉事官，淸水書記官，岩井領事，及船津辰一郞·波多博·頭山秀玉·日高淸磨瑳等二百餘人，濟濟一堂，情况熱烈。聞蘭事氏主席，即席致歡迎詞，繼由谷大使褚外長相繼致詞　，即由會員代表張一鵬致詞，最後宜讀上、王席致敬電，及向東條首相重光外相致敬電三則，途進用茶點，直至下午五時半始　歡南而散。</p>
<p>主席致詞　主席開蘭亭致辭如下：「今天本會舉行茶會，歡迎日本駐華大使谷正之閣下，辱承大駕光臨，實爲榮幸，自谷大使蒞任以來，中日外交開係，顯有新的進展，在外相任內，即與前任重光大使對中國聲明撤廢治外法權，及交還租界，値茲中日合作共同保衛東亞的大時代中，谷大使來華先後履行諾言，表現日本援助國府之眞誠，凡吾國民，莫不鼓舞歡　，谷大使來華後，往來南北，僕僕京滬道上，接洽公務，殊形忙碌。此番來滬，商酌接收租界事宜，今天承蒙出席歡迎茶會，不但本會同人表示感奮，即參加全體來賓，均覺榮幸非常。谷大使蒞任以來，援助國府，在外交方面進展不遺餘力，最近我國褚外長與谷大使於六月三十日簽訂接收上海公共租界，並定於八月一日正式交還，目前又在進行接收上海法租界事宜。從此我國主權獨立，領土完整，全　谷大使鼎力援助，今日謹代表中國國民向谷大使致敬。</p>
<p>谷大使詞　谷大使致詞略謂：「今日荷承熱烈招待，衷心歡忻非言可喩，方才主席致詞所言，水人銘感非常，關於中日兩國此次新政策之實行，乃使中日兩國相互瞭解，余言新政策之於茲實現，由於中日兩國問之隔膜已除，以往之不能實行，實因過去東亞遭受共他國家之勢力所籠罩，自大東亞戰事爆發以來，英美勢力完全驅出東亞，而中國亦已參加大東亞戰爭，中日兩國携手對共同敵人宣戰，以是日本產生新的姿態，新的政策，今中日兩國相互提携，站在同一目標，解放東亞建設大東亞新秩序。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭以來，迄今一載有半，日軍已獲得重大勝利，東亞各民族已有顯著之立塲，是以排除英美勢力，乃爲東亞人民之責任，如中國之治外法權撤廢，及租界交還中國，日本當樂願協助，以改觀吾東亞各民族之木來面目，是乃自然之現象。」</p>
<p>禇外長詞　褚外長致詞略謂：「本人此次來滬，得有機會參與國民外交促進令招待歡迎谷大使盛會，至深欣幸，谷大使自蒞任以來，對撤廢中國治外法權至誠協力，及簽訂交還上海公共租界實施條款，並對法租界之交還問題，磋商已具眉目，今上海公共租界已定八月一日由國府收囘，日本之對華新政策，已澈底明朗實現，故對谷大使之協力相助，殊深感謝，至國民外交促進會，爲協助國府推進外交之人民機構，當成立時，本人亦曾麥與，今再度出席參加歡迎谷大使茶會，更感欣慰，冀盼該會會員對國民外交，繼續努力。」</p>
<p>代表演說　會員代表張一鵬氏致詞：「我們常常在這裏歡迎日本貴賓，但是今天歡迎谷正之大使閣下，較之任何一次的歡迎來得愉快而熱烈，爲什麼呢，因爲這囘大使來到中國，使命特別重要，責任特別重大，尤其關於中國主權的完整和獨立，有深切圓滿的期望，自中日諒解確定和平以後，日本對於中國協力扶助的一切，要算得不遺餘力，然而像這一次　中國百年來被人侵略的租界毅然交還，這是從來沒有像這次的慷慨而眞摯的，所以我說，大使的使命特別重要，日本既然把這貴重的禮物送給中國，受禮物的人，決不是行幾個鞠躬禮脫幾句感謝話可以了事的，一定要了解送禮人的意思，鄭重的裝璜起來，安置起來，運用起來，萬一稍有損壞糟榻，那就辜負了送禮人的一番好意，還有什麼面目見他。至於送禮的人，當然要幫助到底，比仿送一部機器給人，如果不會裝配，就應該供給他裝配的材料，或者不會使用，就應該指導他使用的方法，民國五，六年間，就是大正十二三年間，日本也曾送過巨大的禮物，就是參戰借款，無抵押借款，數目達三萬萬之多，這是日置益公使辦的，不幸被北京政府多拿來揮霍浪費掉，倒給老百姓增加了負担，非但不感激，反而責備日本不應該借給政府，所以直到今天。分文沒有還，這是多麼可惜的事。所以我說，大使的責任特別重大，趁今天不容易得到的機會，敬祝中國主權的完整，獨立萬歲，日本領導的大東亞主義萬歲，同時敬祝谷大使健康萬福。」</p>

<p>上海經濟病淀，由於過去終日以來的物質狂漲，又星不治之象，師此次病象惡化之嚴結，則在於投機商利用謠言，從中操縱，操縱米糧價格，操縱烚赤的交易，以致影響一般物價，遺成民不聊生的惡劣現象。</p>
<p>我們曾經一再指出投機囤積份子之如何利用食米與黃金爲其刺激物價上漲的工具、希望當局採取有效的臨時對策，絲毫不假寬容。果然，在對症下藥的一個施策中，最近兩天的上海經濟病象，似乎略有好轉了：由於大批米糧奸商之遭拘捕，米價已經開始囘跌了；凡於美法銀行錢莊之遭檢查，粭赤黑市已經漸趨平　了；此外，爲制止奸商抬高米價，乃有密遺調查員出動調查各市場，公司，商店之舉；爲嚴防商店非法漁利，乃有取締不合標準的度量衡器之舉：因此日來奸商威抱戒心。稍知斂跡。可是，這樣强心劑一般的臨時對策，爲效僅及一時，而澈查奸究的根本方策，則有賴於萬目睽睽的物次調查委員會；聞其當前工作的對象，即爲澈底發囤積；依我們的理想，澈底摘發囤積，自當以澈底檢查全市各　會爲吿合的行動。並且，從各種倉庫中所查出的囤貨，均應由國家作價予以收買，用以配給民間，謂劑物資的缺乏。</p>

<p>要是問上海市民對於現在交還租界有何意見，那未十人之中，倒有九人會先談物價問題，可見物價問題是如何嚴重，這次交還租界，不管它與物價暴漲有無關係，總是日方根據道義精神的善意措置，而且不是一時對中國權宜措施、却是含有恒久性的意義。今年是決戰年，在此重要時期，不能小視今後建設上海中心的民生問題，更不可小視了民生問題中心的物價問題。特別是這一次物價在漲的主因。都爲是政治上謠言所致，這些謠言，不但擾亂經濟，就是對於上海政治治安，也是有最壞的影響，所謂新上海再組織的課題，唯有集中全力解決了嚴重萬分的，物價問題與囤積問題，才有光明的前途。確立了新上海與市政府以後，解決此項間題，定有迅速明朗的處斷，人家都說囤積懲處令，在這個時候是最能發揮政治上效果的，總之，今後的上海市政間題，無論是官治或民治，最要聚的，就是斷然實施物價安定政策，尤須官民全面協力來推動，才有圓滿的效果。交還租界的政治上意義是應該强調的，同時實施民生緊急對策，共必要性亦在於此。（雲鸝：譯自七月九日大陸新報）（完）</p>

<p>日本大使館上海事務所發言人廣田情報部部長於昨（九日）下午三時在陸海外三當局主辦之定例招待本市中國新聞記者團常會席上，對樹立東亞各民族經濟體系，及排除英美荷之侵略東亞經濟勢力，闡述無遺。</p>
<p>聯合團結　廣田情報部長首謂：「此次卡卡西民間經濟使節團小倉氏等一行，由東京來華，將與中國朝野及經濟界作懇談，際此中日兩國日益緊密合作，協力東亞新秩序建設之時，該團此行之使命，於建設東亞新秩序之經濟提携上，殊爲我人所期待，關於建設東亞新秩序之內容，爲團結大東亞各地之民族，聯合建，集團國家羣，相互協力，以求各民族本身自由獨立之發展，此爲現時代政治上必要之趨勢」。</p>
<p>根本要點　至於英美荷三國經濟榨取，以荷印方而訂，如橡皮　熱帶生產物頗豐，每年出口數達四十萬萬元，進口數則爲三十萬萬元，然共中盈餘之十萬萬元，却由荷印當局轉入本國私囊，再以馬來與荷印方而之橡皮生產而言，其產量佔全世界百分之九十，每年有幾十萬噸，亦爲英荷二國所佔有，此外如汽油方面，亦爲英美兩國汽油托辣斯所獨佔，恣意榨取吾束亞民族之利益，從上述二例，暴露無遺，吾人必須排除，而將自己之土地自己之勞力，從事生產增加，振興民生，此即建設東亞新秩序之根本要點。</p>
<p>合理解決　日本爲修正此項世界經濟之矛盾現象，向以和平之手段要求世界各國，主張自由移民，資源分配均等，及通商自由等三大原則，反遭致英美之武力壓迫，故日本毅然以武力向英美宣戰，以爭取東亞民族之解放，而自由獨立，今吾人須以建設新的經濟體系，來擊破藝經濟組織，並確立强大之武力，爲當前之要務。</p>
<p>振興民生　同時更須雙更向來所考慮之辦法。重新樹立東亞經濟理論，査英美向來以擊敗世界經濟之辦法、繫於理論之宣傳，並以金木位爲原則，然再等大東亞經濟之理論，則以組織爲原則，力求收囘東亞之全部工業，且謀金本位變爲管理通貨之代替，更以自身勞力爲根本，則中日兩國經濟之提携合作，即可圓滿成立。而全東亞之民族，亦可美滿發展，，易言之，在東亞大地上所有之資源與產業，以東亞各民族之勞力從事開發與生產。而振興東亞各民族之民生，此爲當前最重要之急務。</p>

<p>— 耶魯</p>
<p>佛要金裝，人要衣裝。其實，人不但要衣裝，相貌也相當重要，所以相貌堂堂，衣冠楚楚的人物，總好像有得意揚揚的神氣，也好像到處可佔便宜。而且也好容易得到人家的青睞。這大概是風氣使然，無怪有些人要假手於美容的改造，或者時常油頭粉面，甚至不惜工本，製幾　　貴衣裳；青可省吃儉用。場面却不可不撐。</p>
<p>人皆有愛美之心，修飾打扮，固然無可厚非，但是如果爲了虛榮的誇耀，或別有作用，那就要不得了。可是事實上，由於人情的勢力，聲色的誘惑，好事裝扮粉飾者流，大抵不免有「居心不善」的成份。正因爲這樣，所以「外强中乾」，「金玉其外敗絮其中」者，實繁有徒。</p>
<p>我們常見的泥塑木彫，可以譽爲「威靈顯赫」，可以使「善男信女」虔誠瞻拜，甚至信爲「有求必應」。可是泥塑木彫究竟是泥塑木彫，根本與人痛　　　。</p>
<p>俗語說「人不可貌相」。確是經騐之談，因爲「道貌岸然」，不一定就是好人，而忠厚之相，也未必有善者之心。而且今日是親人的面孔，也許明日一變爲仇人的面孔了。他如「聰明面孔笨肚腸」以及「笑面虎」之類的情形，大概稍有社會經騐的人，都曾遇到過的。</p>
<p>至於衣服，是身外之物，隨時可以更換，除了「只重衣衫不重人」的關係之外，和人格身份方面好像無關宏旨的。於是「衣冠禽獸」可以雜然並　了。</p>
<p>其實，一個人在相貌方面，祗要五官端正，耳能分「是非」且能別「黑白」，……在衣服方面，祗要整潔大方，不尙虛榮……若反其道而行之。則絕不是堂堂正正的人。</p>

<p>烟纸店門口，南貨店面前，常常人山人海。他們是買香烟的，傾白糖的。因爲人多，大家又想快點吃着香烟，甜了嘴巴，於是都用出氣力，拼命地「擠」上去。而且個個都「精神十倍，」</p>
<p>一等軋壞了認，碰碎了玻璃，大家又立刻變成了「敗軍之將」，恐怕自己吃着了虧。做了「瘟生」。於是你推我讓，反正老子「死人不關」。大可不聞不問了。</p>
<p>這不但是大家買香烟，領白糖時候的態度，而且是一般人們處世的哲學</p>
<p>誰都以「自私自利」的立場出發，於是祗要事情對自己有好處，就用全力以求之。往往因此損害了別人，也所不惜。</p>
<p>反之，要是這件事對他有點不利，或者「吃力不討好」。那末不管幹了會給大衆多大利益，自己却是「隔岸觀火」，你急我不急。因此造成「各人自掃門前雪，莫管他人瓦上霜」的觀念來。</p>
<p>這是現社會的「眞理」（？）嗎？</p>

<p>— 沈沈</p>
<p>陸甲長一壁也在想這種事，可眞難了。要說用了錢把人放囘，那末這幾個錢是不夠的。要是多用錢，那末這一點已經是傾阿坤的所有了。他一眼看看李鎮長和張參謀，似乎都在出神，他就插嘴道：「這件事情，我們大家已經明白了。第一，阿坤實在是窮，萬萬榨不出油來的。要請張參謀硬硬頭皮，向司令好好的說，第二我們雖然當了這份寳貝的鎮長甲長，也不願半夜三更做良心上不願做的事情。要請司令想想透澈，地方上的人情，也不能做的十分惡劣的。時候已經不早了。就請張參謀向司令去講吧！我們等在這兒。」張參謀經陸甲長的慫恿，遲疑了一刻，一邊，慢慢地轉身向外，一邊說：</p>
<p>「讓我試試看，不成功的話，我也沒有辦法的。」轉着灣，一直向司令室走去，推進門瞥見×司令正伏在桌上一疊一疊的數鈔票，見着張參謀近來，連忙把一張包鈔票的新聞紙，順手的掩蓋着。一面說道：</p>
<p>「怎麼樣？他們肯出多少錢，我看這兩個傢伙不大懂公事，剛才嘮嘮叨叨的說了一大套不識相的話，要不是我們隊伍今天開到，早就兩記耳光，打了再說。」×司令說完話，似乎很生氣的樣子，立起身來反背着雙手，離開坐位踱着方步。張參謀心裏倒有些躊躇，想說了數目，那一定會被他臭罵，因爲熟悉了他的胃口之大。不說不成，着實爲難了一會，總於說：</p>
<p>「司令！這件事情，我也第一囘碰到，那個抓的是本鄉出名的窮鬼，又是剛剛生了一場大病，方才我同李鎮長們談了很多的話，實在想不出辦法。不過，照我們隊部裏的規矩，總要有點面子，後來李鎮長說，只能想法到……」張參謀半吞半吐的不說下去。</p>
<p>「多少？多少？」×司令不耐煩的追問着。</p>
<p>「唔！六……六百，……六百元。」張參謀終於老實說了，說完話，低下頭　着。×司令聽了，把頭頸狠命地　扭，轉向張參謀緊瞧着，立定踱着方步的雙脚，說道：</p>
<p>「哼！難道天下有這樣便宜的事嗎？豈有此理！我姓×的幹了這麼幾年，從來不曾有過這笑話的。……豈有此理！」×司令很生氣的表白出自己的心胸。（八）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Further Advice to the Economic Delegation from Friendly Japan <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Since the arrival of the economic delegation from our friendly nation in Shanghai, our newspaper, from the standpoint of the Chinese people, has taken the lead in raising several opinions on China's current economic problems, followed by statements on the source and state of our country's economic ills. The mission of the delegation's visit to China is "to hold concrete discussions on economic cooperation between the two countries and fully accept the opinions of Chinese people." Undoubtedly, the delegation will also compile a report on the results of these discussions for the Japanese government to consider. Therefore, we are very willing to take this opportunity to fully disclose our opinions for the delegation to consider when suggesting adjustments to Sino-Japanese economic relations. At the same time, we hope that the delegation can convey our opinions to the Japanese government and public without any concealment.</p>
<p>The two great nations of China and Japan have inseparable reasons in history, geography, and language. Especially given that the white race invariably discriminates against colored races, the two great nations of China and Japan should unite more closely. In terms of naval, land, and air military preparations, Japan is indeed far superior to China, but in terms of manpower and resources, China surpasses Japan. Therefore, from the perspective of national defense and economy, cooperation between China and Japan benefits both, while separation harms both. How can East Asian nations achieve the status of masters of East Asia unless the two great nations of China and Japan cooperate sincerely? This is a fact that no Japanese or Chinese person can deny.</p>
<p>Because the two great nations of China and Japan each have their own advantages in nation-building, and because the two great nations of China and Japan, once united, are sufficient to control all of Asia, or at the very least, can drive the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States out of the East Asian region, those who are jealous spare no effort to provoke discord between China and Japan. Unfortunately, this trick of provocation and discord has actually succeeded, causing both China and Japan to suffer significant losses in manpower and resources. If not, if the conspiracies of Britain and the United States are exposed, they will also be dragged into the vortex of war. Wouldn’t this mean that the strength of China and Japan would be mutually depleted, while the power of Britain and the United States would grow? Between one declining and one growing, what kind of predicament would the East Asian nations fall into?</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and China's participation, Japan's policy towards China has undergone a significant change. From then on, if the people of both countries can thoroughly eliminate past misunderstandings and move towards close cooperation to engage in the development of the East Asian economy, not only can the prosperity of China and Japan be expected, but other nations in East Asia will also benefit.</p>
<p>The reason for the past economic conflicts between China and Japan was that Japan was an industrial nation, while China also had a strong tendency to develop its industry. From a superficial observation, China's industrial development was obviously detrimental to Japan. However, after thorough research, this antagonistic phenomenon is fundamentally untenable. Because China is vast in land and abundant in resources, with a dense population, there is great potential for increased production and consumption. In the past, the poverty of China's production and consumption was due to the weakness of the national economic strength. The reason for this was the oppression of economic aggression from Britain and the United States and the impact of years of internal strife. Now that various obstacles have been removed, the national economic situation can of course improve, and at the same time, production and consumption can obviously increase accordingly. Moreover, the resources and markets of East Asia are now completely under the control of East Asian nations, so raw materials and markets are fundamentally not a problem. Therefore, the past phenomena of conflict and antagonism can no longer continue to exist.</p>
<p>Based on the above observations, improving China's national economy is not only solving China's future economic problems, but also jointly solving Japan's future economic problems. In this situation, the people of both countries should embrace the mindset that helping others is helping oneself.</p>
<p>The first thing we want to request the delegation to help us solve today is the issue of stabilizing finance. Because without financial stability, there can be no talk of any production or construction. Rampant hoarding and skyrocketing prices cannot be stopped. Methods to stabilize finance: (1) To balance fiscal revenue and expenditure, from a passive perspective, unnecessary military and administrative expenses should be reduced, and redundant institutions should be abolished or merged. From a positive perspective, existing tax revenues should be effectively consolidated, embezzlement should be strictly prohibited, and inheritance taxes and excess profit taxes should be implemented to enrich the national treasury. If there is still a shortfall, only public bonds can be issued to compensate, and the issuance of banknotes should absolutely not be increased to avoid affecting the credit of the currency. (2) Maintain a balance in the exchange of materials and trade between China and Japan, so that the currency flowing into the private sector due to the purchase of materials can still be recovered to avoid inflation. (3) The government should actively promote the joint development of various enterprises by domestic financial and business circles to guide idle funds into legitimate channels. (4) Openly supervise the issuance operations of the Central Reserve Bank, which should not issue currency for purposes other than developing production, and strive to gradually replenish its reserves. Although most of the above issues belong to China itself, because the members of the delegation are all authorities in the domestic finance and economy of Japan, from the standpoint of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, assisting in adjustments is also an unshirkable duty.</p>
<p>Secondly, what we want to raise is the issue of people's food. Although China is known as an agricultural country, because farmers' knowledge is naive and agricultural technology is backward, on the one hand, we still have to rely on the import of rice, wheat, and flour to compensate for the shortage of people's food. After the Sino-Japanese Incident, the rural areas have become more and more dilapidated, and agricultural production has become less and less, so the issue of people's food has become more and more serious. As for the issue of people's food in big cities, because an additional transportation relationship has been added, it is particularly serious. At present, the price of rice in Shanghai is equal to 150 times that before the Sino-Japanese Incident. If we do not rush to remedy it, all industries will perish together. The fundamental solution is for us to manage ourselves to stabilize rural order and develop rural finance, so that all agricultural products can gradually increase. The temporary solution is to hope that our friendly nations will help us solve the first issue of domestic grain transportation. The recent high price of rice is not entirely related to the availability of grain, but to the smoothness of the source. As long as the authorities in charge of transportation pay special attention to this point, and can handle grain transportation in advance no matter when or where, without causing any stagnation, it can indirectly help stabilize the price of rice. The second is the issue of reasonably purchasing grain. The price of grain purchased from rural areas must be reasonably determined according to the cost of production, so that farmers are happy to sell what they have left over. These two points not only from the perspective of economic cooperation, Japan should help China, but also from the perspective of human sympathy, it seems that it cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>The above two points are issues that must be urgently resolved for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, so we first put forward concrete opinions. As for other related issues, we will continue to raise them. We always hope that the inspection team can use a method that cures the disease with medicine to save our chronic illness.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 9th: The Japanese Naval Air Force attacked enemy troops stationed on Rubiana Island, south of Munda on New Georgia Island, on July 7th, causing a large fire in their positions and shooting down 31 enemy fighters in the skies above the island. Four Japanese aircraft have not yet returned to base.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – After landing on Rendova Island on June 3rd, a portion of the American forces continued their attempts to land on Kula Gulf on the northwest coast of New Georgia Island. As announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 7th, the enemy forces suffered a great blow in this night battle of Kula Gulf. The enemy forces then advanced in a planned manner to Rubiana Island, between Rendova Island and New Georgia Island, to build fortifications, intending to make the island a base of operations. However, after discovering the enemy's intentions, the Japanese Naval Air Force immediately launched a fierce attack on the enemy positions, causing large fires everywhere, defeating them, and inflicting a great blow. Furthermore, on the same day, Japanese naval aircraft engaged in fierce aerial combat with dozens of enemy fighters in the skies above the island, resulting in the shooting down of half of the enemy aircraft, a total of 31, achieving a great victory and setting a brilliant record of 31 against 4.</p>

<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) – The German authorities announced on the 9th that German forces shot down a total of 80 Soviet aircraft in the Belgorod-Orel region. Since the start of operations in that area, German forces have shot down more than 262 enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>Stockholm via Keijo, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to a London dispatch, the Moscow correspondent of the British Electrical and Allied Manufacturers Association (BEAMA) reported that the battle in the Orel-Kursk region is still progressing, and it is not yet possible to determine its outcome. The front line between Orel and Belgorod is seeing a large-scale war of attrition. The Soviet army has deployed an unprecedented number of tanks and aircraft. The German army is also launching a fierce attack on the Soviet army with a group of hundreds of tanks on a ten-kilometer front. Well-informed sources predict that the battle will become more and more intense and will reach its peak around the 10th.</p>
<p>Stockholm via Keijo, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to a Moscow dispatch from the Associated Press: Germany is currently adding its largest-ever armored force to the current pincer movement, aiming to encircle and annihilate 400,000 Soviet troops in the Kursk salient. Moscow has officially acknowledged that the German army is attacking Orel, the northern wing of the pincer movement near Kursk, with six tank divisions, one motorized division, and eight infantry divisions, totaling 206,500 men and 1,300 tanks. The southern wing of the pincer movement, near Belgorod, is being attacked by nine tank divisions and six infantry divisions, totaling 200,000 men and 1,800 tanks.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Germany Uses Tanks to Widen Breakthrough Gap <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) – Haitong News Agency reports: Yesterday was the fourth day of the Battle of Kursk, and both sides sent in large numbers of fresh troops to assist in the battle, so the battle is becoming increasingly fierce. Although the Soviet army has dispatched fresh troops from further away from the front line, it still retains a portion of its tank forces, as does the German army, so the peak of the battle has not yet been reached. The Soviet commander has ordered a desperate defense. In order to obey the order, his subordinates are making every effort to hold their ground in ground fortresses at any cost, so the losses of the Soviet army in manpower and material resources are increasing greatly. The center of the battle on Thursday was located at two points: 60 kilometers north of Belgorod and 20 kilometers south of Orel. The Soviet army's attempt to reduce the pressure on its flanks by attacking the middle of the salient in the Orel-Belgorod line failed. Such actions have no important significance compared to the war in the Orel and Belgorod areas. The purpose of the Soviet counterattack was to repel the German army and then break through the German lines, but it was unsuccessful. On the contrary, the German army has widened the gap in the breakthrough, penetrating deep into enemy territory. The German army is using tanks to advance northward in numbers never seen before in any battlefield in this war. The terrain of the Kursk salient is well-suited for the use of tanks. German tanks are taking advantage of this advantage to quickly press on the enemy forces. The losses of the Soviet tank forces are several times greater than the losses of the German army. There are three reasons for this: (1) The German Tiger tanks are superior to the Soviet T-34 tanks, which were used for the first time; (2) The German army uses new and the most powerful anti-tank weapons; (3) The German Air Force has air superiority, allowing the German army to use a large number of aircraft to attack Soviet tank forces and their fortified positions. Twenty percent of the tanks lost by the Soviet army were manufactured in Britain and the United States, including many of the American-vaunted Sherman, Grant, and Lee tanks. The ratio of aircraft lost by Germany and the Soviet Union is one to fifteen, which shows the superiority of the German Air Force.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Large Armies Contend for Every Inch of Land, Battle Situation Becoming All-Out <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm via Keijo, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to a Moscow dispatch: German forces on the Eastern Front have launched another offensive in the Kalibo region northwest of Moscow, repeatedly attacking Soviet positions. It is also reported that German and Soviet forces have begun fierce artillery battles along the Mivoz River west of Rostov. According to a Berlin dispatch, German coastal batteries in the Leningrad region suddenly and fiercely bombed Soviet positions, docks, and factory areas in the city of Leningrad. Therefore, the war situation on the Eastern Front has become all-out. At the same time, the fierce offensive and defensive battle between Germany and the Soviet Union in the Kursk salient is intensifying daily. The two sides have gathered a large army of two million men between Orel in the north and Belgorod in the south, a front line stretching 270 kilometers, to fight to the death for every inch of land. According to the German authorities, German forces have currently crushed the Soviet offensive, and they point out that German forces may launch an offensive to adapt to the progress of the battle. According to Moscow news, German forces are currently launching a pincer attack on Soviet forces in the large Kursk salient from both sides of Orel and Belgorod, and are conducting an encirclement and annihilation battle. According to frontline news, German forces have been constantly deploying new reserve forces to strengthen the offensive since the 8th, so the war situation on the Eastern Front will expand even further in the future. Currently, the main force of the German offensive is still placed in the Orel area and the area north of Belgorod. According to frontline news from the 8th, under the cover of the air force, German forces have deployed groups of hundreds of tanks to widen the breakthrough in the Soviet positions, causing a large part of the Soviet forces in the Kursk area north to be isolated. The large-scale tank battle between Germany and the Soviet Union has formed an unprecedented large-scale mechanized war.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Japanese Army in China Announces One Week of Battle Situation <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Dispatch Army in China announced the battle situation for one week on July 9th as follows: Among the comprehensive battle results of the Japanese China Dispatch Army in the past year, the most noteworthy are the prisoners of war and those who surrendered from the Chongqing army, totaling 245,000 people, an increase of about three times compared to the same period last year. In addition, the number of captured cannons has increased by about two times, the number of heavy and light machine guns has increased by about one and a half times, and the number of firearms has increased by three times. From this, it can be seen that since the supply routes of weapons to the Chongqing army were cut off, their will to fight has greatly declined. Furthermore, the Chongqing side has already lost the name of resisting the war. The surge in deserters from the Chongqing army further proves this. As for the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing, it once used a combined formation of more than 20 fighter-bombers to blindly bomb the Guangzhou area on the 7th of this month. Two aircraft were shot down by Japanese aircraft, and the rest fled. The American Air Force stationed in Chongqing has recently seemed to actively attempt to air raid areas occupied by the Japanese army. It is currently working hard to increase the number of aircraft and store fuel. For example, the Jianling and Liangshan air bases in Chongqing are completely under the control of the American army. What is also noteworthy is that the American Air Force has now abandoned its past guerrilla warfare and is showing a tendency to challenge the Japanese Air Force head-on. As for the Chongqing Air Force, it seems to be lurking in the interior of Sichuan recently. This phenomenon may be because the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing is cold towards the Chongqing Air Force and does not provide assistance. From this, it can also be seen the ambition of the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing to weaken the Chongqing Air Force's strength in order to place it under its own control.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese China Fleet's Hainan Unit, in order to thoroughly annihilate the remaining enemies in the Hainan Island area, has been carrying out operations of dividing and reducing them since last year. After first destroying the Communist army entrenched in the northeastern part of the island in late November last year, it began to mop up the remaining bandits in the northwestern part of the island at the beginning of this year. The elite Japanese Marines, with the cooperation of naval aircraft, carried out surprise attacks, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. After the National Government entered the war and Japanese troops entered Guangzhou Bay, the enemy army lost its will to fight. As announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 8th, nearly 100 enemy corpses were abandoned, 1,000 people were captured, and more than 3,600 people surrendered, indicating that the enemy bandits have been completely defeated. This punitive expedition lasted more than 200 days, with more than 6,000 battles fought, and a great victory was achieved. At present, the Japanese army has built a solid defensive line, so the enemy's guerrilla warfare has no effect.</p>

<h3 id="e12">Minister of Construction Chen Arrives in Japan and Makes a Speech <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – Minister of Construction of the National Government and Secretary-General of the National Economic Council, Mr. Chen Junhui, arrived here on the 7th to inspect the construction situation in Japan under wartime conditions and to hold discussions with various regular bureaus of the Japanese government. At 5 PM on the 9th, he specially hosted a group of reporters at the Imperial Hotel here to make a speech, explaining the situation of China's economic reconstruction and construction, and the current situation of developing farmland and water conservancy. The general idea was: the National Economic Council, in response to Japan's new policy, has strengthened its operational guidelines since February, and has brought together influential people from the political, financial, and private sectors to start activities as a deliberative body for economic construction. The General Association for Commercial Control has completed the preparation of its subordinate organizations in mid-June, and has implemented autonomous control over the purchase and distribution of materials. The Ministry of Construction, in order to adapt to the new situation, once set the highest goal of developing the economy and stabilizing people's livelihoods in February of this year, so it reorganized and expanded the former Ministry of Communications and the Water Conservancy Commission, and decided to implement a three-year construction plan to strive for its implementation in order to develop the undertakings of these two organizations. The three-year construction plan is focused on the development of farmland and water conservancy. At present, it has started to reclaim the East Taihu Lake and has dispatched a technical team to work there. Once the on-site survey is completed, it will start reclamation immediately. It is estimated that after the completion of the East Taihu Lake reclamation plan, 16,000 hectares of fertile land can be obtained, and 70 million dan of rice can be harvested. As for the development of other pond areas along the Yangtze River, plans have also been started to promote their realization as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Ministry of Construction Forms an East Taihu Lake Water Conservancy Inspection Team <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Suzhou, 9th (Central News Agency) – Taihu Lake straddles the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang and is a large lake in the Jiangnan region. Irrigation is convenient in various places around the lake, and the benefits are not shallow. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction recently organized an East Taihu Lake Survey Team to start surveying and mapping in order to improve the water conservancy plan. It is known that in order to strengthen agricultural production at this time of total war and to design improvements for the Taihu Lake water conservancy problem, the Ministry of Construction specially appointed Cai Fuchu, a specialist with the rank of chief, and Wang Jiazhang and Tao Jiaxian, technicians from the Water Conservancy Department, to join Japanese water conservancy expert Aki Kōichi and others to form the East Taihu Lake Water Conservancy Inspection Team. They departed from Beijing a few days ago and came to the East Taihu Lake Basin to inspect and collect materials related to water conservancy. The inspection area of the team includes Suzhou, Shanghai, Wujiang, Jiaxing, Songjiang, Qingpu, Changshu, and other places. When necessary, it will also inspect important towns and districts along Taihu Lake. The inspection period is more than 20 days. The provincial government has now received a notice from the Ministry of Construction, instructing the relevant counties to assist in a unified manner.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Japanese Technician Invents Coconut Meat Soy Sauce <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – Mr. Koyama Eiji, an agricultural doctor and army technician at the Japanese Army Food Depot, has recently invented soy sauce made from coconut meat residue. According to the usual practice, after extracting coconut oil, soap, glycerin, explosives, and other raw materials from coconuts, the remaining coconut meat residue is only used as fertilizer and feed. Now, through Mr. Koyama's research, this amazing invention has been completed in a short period of time, which is truly rare. Ordinarily, it takes about two years to brew soy sauce from soybeans and wheat, while brewing this coconut meat soy sauce only takes four or five months. Although its seasoning effect is slightly inferior to ordinary soy sauce, other aspects are more than satisfactory. It can also be used with ordinary soy sauce brewing equipment and can be mixed with soybeans and wheat, so it has many advantages of being flexible and adaptable. Therefore, the invention of coconut meat soy sauce can save Japan hundreds of thousands of dan of soybeans and about one million dan of wheat per year in domestic soy sauce consumption.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Zhou Naiwen Discusses Grain Matters: Recent Grain Policy Situation; Rice Prices Soar Due to Rising Commodity Prices <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency): Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency visited Zhou Naiwen, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Food, who received the reporter and discussed the grain policy situation as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) What is the significance of the establishment of the Central Grain Storage Bureau, what is its lower-level organizational structure, and when will it be formally established? (Answer) The main purpose of establishing the Central Grain Storage Bureau is to strengthen unified procurement, adapt to the wartime system, and completely separate business from administration. All measures emphasize economics and commercialization to ensure sufficient procurement and storage of food, thereby stabilizing people's food supply and ensuring military provisions. The provisional regulations for its organization have been approved by the Executive Yuan, and preparations are actively underway, with the aim of formally establishing it in July. Its lower-level organizations will consist solely of rice and grain joint operation societies in each production area, which will be the sole procurement agencies. Members of the joint operation societies will go to various villages to collect rice and grain, submit them to the Grain Storage Bureau, and await distribution orders from the Ministry of Food for transportation to various sales areas. Therefore, in the future, the Grain Storage Bureau will supervise procurement, issue licenses, allocate funds, inspect prices, and handle acceptance inspection and transportation matters. Branch bureaus or offices will be established in each unified procurement area to ensure responsibility and facilitate business. (Question) Why was the publicly sold rice in the capital city not distributed as scheduled in late June? (Answer) The Powdered Food Department is responsible for the supply of publicly sold rice in the capital, and the municipal government is responsible for the distribution. Distribution has always been on schedule, and both the central and local governments pay close attention. Therefore, the people's food supply in the capital has always been considered stable. As for the slightly delayed distribution of publicly sold rice in late June, the reason is that the distribution of flour in mid-June was a new procedure, and efforts were made to ensure the thoroughness of the organization. This inevitably took some time, resulting in a related delay in the distribution of publicly sold rice in late June. The schedule for distribution has now been set, and the notices for rice distribution in early July have also been fully issued. (Question) There has been a shortage of rice recently, so a portion has been distributed as flour. There is also an abundance of privately sold rice in the capital, with inflated prices, disrupting the grain policy. What specific measures does the Ministry of Food have to take to crack down on this? (Answer) The shortage of rice and grain during the period when the old grain is exhausted and the new grain is not yet available is a common phenomenon. Therefore, the Ministry of Food has long been prepared for this and is distributing flour to implement the policy of "regulating surplus and deficiency" and conserving consumption. As for the recent presence of privately sold rice in the capital, the abundance has already passed. Currently, the main source of privately sold rice is the gradual accumulation of stocks by hoarders several months ago. Now, with rice prices soaring and the new grain about to enter the market, they are eagerly seeking to release their stocks onto the market. The Ministry's crackdown measures still consist of strictly enforcing law enforcement. The Nanjing smuggling suppression area has been divided into an inner and outer perimeter. The urban area is the inner perimeter, and the Food Bureau is fully responsible for suppressing smuggling. Jiangwan, Jiangpu, Quanshui, Jurong, and other counties are the outer perimeter, where the Ministry of Food has set up inspection stations to conduct regular investigations and suppression. The county governments also organize smuggling suppression teams to assist in the work. On the one hand, attention is paid to smuggling routes to strictly prevent departures. On the other hand, attention is paid to hoarders within the territory. If necessary, door-to-door searches will be conducted. If hoarders can lower prices and invest in the public sector as soon as possible, they may be exempted from punishment. (Question) Rice prices in various counties of Jiangsu Province have been rising recently, making it difficult to purchase. This situation is likely to be transitional, but the general public does not understand the truth. It seems that the authorities should provide a concrete explanation to reassure the public. (Answer) Although rice prices in various counties of Jiangsu Province have risen recently, the black market price has not yet exceeded 1,000 yuan. The biggest reason is the sudden surge in general commodity prices. Farmers or merchants who have not stored goods, given the increased burden of expenses, inevitably increase prices. In the past, the market was accustomed to commodity prices fluctuating according to rice prices. In recent years, rice prices have been affected by commodity prices, putting the cart before the horse, which has never been seen before. This is because general commodities have not yet been fully subjected to strengthened controls. Tightening and loosening have led to today's special phenomenon. Now, the National Federation of Commercial Control Associations has been established, and its lower-level organizations have also been fully organized. Separate professional committees have been formed for wheat flour and miscellaneous grains, which are most closely linked to rice and grain. Various major agricultural and industrial commodities will soon be fully incorporated into the unified control system. Supply and demand should be regulated effectively, and commodity prices will gradually return to the right track and achieve balance. At that time, rice prices will naturally be able to restore their uniqueness and exert their autonomous ability. Supply and demand will not harm farmers or agriculture, and rice prices can always be driven on a level playing field. Moreover, during this period when the old grain is exhausted and the new grain is not yet available, scarce reserves and manipulation by unscrupulous merchants are also factors in the price increase. The Ministry has made full preparations for the transition period, and the early rice in various counties of the Jiangsu gang will be available in one month to help the people's food supply. Therefore, there is absolutely no problem with the people's food supply in various counties of Jiangsu Province at present.</p>

<p>Stockholm, via Kyoto, 9th (Central News Agency): According to a dispatch from London, the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, has departed for Moscow to hold talks with his government. Political figures in London acknowledge that his sudden return to the Soviet Union is related to recent military developments. London figures believe that the Soviet Ambassador's return home is at least indirectly related to the German offensive in the Orel and Kursk regions. Soviet reports also acknowledge that Soviet troops on the Eastern Front are encountering difficult times. Therefore, British figures emphasize the need to adapt to the difficulties, and the only way to do so is to open the long-awaited Second Front. Reports from Swedish parliamentarians in London also state that the Soviet Ambassador was summoned home to report to the government on Washington and London's attitudes towards the Second Front.</p>

In addition, the handshake or palms-together greeting that Indians used to use when meeting will henceforth be replaced by the mutual greeting "Jai Hind," which in Indian language means victory, in order to further strengthen the awareness of the independence struggle in daily etiquette.</p>

<p>Vichy, 9th (Central News Agency): Havas reports: According to news received here yesterday, demonstrations have taken place on the streets of Fort-de-France, the capital of Martinique, advocating unification with the French National Liberation Committee in Algiers. Part of this demonstration has developed into open rebellion, and a fortress containing the Bank of France's gold reserves is said to have been occupied by rebels. Tensions between Governor-General Robert of the island and the US government have been exacerbated by the unrest on the island. The French Foreign Ministry here received two telegrams from Robert yesterday morning, which may shed some light on the situation there. The French Foreign Ministry is currently drafting a public statement on the island, which may officially announce Martinique's secession from Vichy. According to news received from Port of Spain, Trinidad, the demonstrations began on June 24, the anniversary of the French-German armistice. Although several rebel leaders have been arrested, order has not yet been restored. The troops sent to suppress the rebels also openly sympathize with the rebels, so Robert's position is extremely difficult. Washington news also confirms that Martinique has not yet unified with the Liberation Committee. Well-informed sources here emphasize that de Gaulle did not stop in Martinique on his way to the United States, which shows that the situation on the island has not yet been clarified. These sources also predict that Robert will succumb to the dissidents.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency): About one million American shipbuilding workers, through their union, are demanding increased wages, so a new labor strife is about to occur in the United States. The employers have tried to slightly increase wages to resolve the matter, but have not succeeded. Union leaders insist that there must be a substantial increase, arguing that the cost of living has risen by about 18% in the past year, and in some cities, food prices have risen to 80%. Washington is particularly concerned about this new labor strife threat. According to those close to President Roosevelt, this nationwide strike trend should be attributed to the inflationary tendencies of a large part of Congress, especially representatives of farmers and food groups. At the same time, the United Auto Workers has sent a telegram to President Roosevelt, requesting the government to take over the General Motors plant in Saginaw, Michigan, where thousands of workers have been laid off due to a strike by toolmakers. According to the Swedish Aftonbladet, 500,000 railroad workers, 500,000 coal miners, 500,000 steelworkers, and 1 million dockworkers in the United States are currently living in great difficulty.</p>

<p>To welcome Japanese Ambassador to China, Gu Zhengzhi, the China National Foreign Affairs Promotion Association held a grand tea party at the Xingya Building Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association at 4 pm yesterday (9th), taking advantage of Ambassador Gu's visit to Shanghai. Ambassador Gu arrived on time, and attended the event, as well as: Dean Wen Zongyao, Foreign Minister Chu Minyi, Ambassador Wu Kaisheng, Ambassador Tang Liangli, Ambassador Chen Jicheng, Minister Xia Fenfeng, Zhou Jue, Wen Lanting, Yuan Deng, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Yipeng, Sun Lifu, Chen Shao, Li Quanshi, Ye Xuesong, Yuan Houzhi, Xue Fengyuan, Yan Jinqing, Wu Yimo, Jin Zongcheng, Chen Riping, Chen Yafu, Zhou Bangjun, Yan Fuqing, Xiang Kangyuan, Yan Jiabao, Jian Qingxiang, Zhusheng Sen, Shen Shuyu, Chen Bofan, Gu Nanqun, Ye Fuxiao, Zheng Hongyan, Lan Sen, Wang Yongkang, Wang Yuzhai, Lei Xianzhi, etc., and on the Japanese side, Ambassador Taita Oda, Secretary Qingshui, Consul Iwai, and Tatsichiro Funatsu, Hoto Hiroshi, Hideyoshi Toyama, Kiyomasa Hidaka, etc., over 200 people, gathering together, situation enthusiastic.

Finally, Upper Seat and Wang Seat's message of respect and three messages of respect to Prime Minister Tojo and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu were read, followed by refreshments, and the event dispersed happily at 5:30 pm.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: Chairman Kai Lanting's speech is as follows: "Today, our association is holding a tea party to welcome Japanese Ambassador to China, Gu Zhengzhi. We are honored to have you grace us with your presence. Since Ambassador Gu took office, there has been significant new progress in Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. As Foreign Minister, he and former Ambassador Shigemitsu declared the abolition of extraterritorial rights and the return of concessions to China. At this time of Sino-Japanese cooperation to jointly defend East Asia, Ambassador Gu came to China and fulfilled his promises, demonstrating Japan's sincerity in assisting the National Government. All our people are encouraged and rejoiced. After coming to China, Ambassador Gu traveled between the north and south, busy on the road between Kyoto and Shanghai, contacting official business, very busy. This time he came to Shanghai to discuss the handover of the concessions. Today, we are honored to have you attend the welcome tea party. Not only our association members express their excitement, but also all the guests present feel very honored. Since Ambassador Gu took office, he has spared no effort to assist the National Government and make progress in diplomacy. Recently, our Foreign Minister Chu and Ambassador Gu signed an agreement on June 30 to take over the Shanghai Public Concession, and it is scheduled to be officially returned on August 1. Currently, negotiations on the handover of the Shanghai French Concession are also underway. From then on, our country's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, all benefit from Ambassador Gu's strong assistance. Today, I would like to pay tribute to Ambassador Gu on behalf of the Chinese people."</p>
<p>Ambassador Gu's Speech: Ambassador Gu's speech briefly stated: "Today, I am deeply grateful for the warm hospitality. The words spoken by the chairman just now are deeply engraved in my mind. The implementation of this new policy between China and Japan is to enable mutual understanding between the two countries. I say that the realization of the new policy is because the barriers between China and Japan have been removed. The reason why it could not be implemented in the past was because East Asia was shrouded in the power of other countries. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, British and American forces have been completely driven out of East Asia, and China has also participated in the Greater East Asia War. China and Japan have joined hands to declare war on a common enemy, so Japan has adopted a new attitude and a new policy. Now, China and Japan support each other and stand on the same goal: to liberate East Asia and build a new order in Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Since the Greater East Asia War, for the past year and a half, the Japanese army has achieved major victories, and the various ethnic groups in East Asia have gained a significant foothold. Therefore, eliminating British and American forces is the responsibility of the people of East Asia. If China's extraterritorial rights are abolished and the concessions are returned to China, Japan will be happy to assist in changing the future face of our East Asian ethnic groups. This is a natural phenomenon."</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Chu's Speech: Foreign Minister Chu's speech briefly stated: "I am very happy to have the opportunity to participate in the National Foreign Affairs Promotion Association's grand welcome to Ambassador Gu during this visit to Shanghai. Since Ambassador Gu took office, he has sincerely cooperated in abolishing China's extraterritorial rights, signing the implementation terms for the return of the Shanghai Public Concession, and the negotiations on the return of the French Concession have already made progress. Now, the Shanghai Public Concession is scheduled to be taken back by the National Government on August 1. Japan's new policy towards China has been thoroughly clarified and realized, so I am deeply grateful for Ambassador Gu's cooperation and assistance. As for the National Foreign Affairs Promotion Association, as a people's organization to assist the National Government in promoting diplomacy, I also participated in its establishment. I am even more pleased to attend and participate in the tea party welcoming Ambassador Gu again. I hope that the members of the association will continue to work hard on national foreign affairs."</p>
<p>Representative Speech: Member Representative Zhang Yipeng's speech: "We often welcome Japanese guests here, but today's welcome to Ambassador Gu Zhengzhi is more pleasant and enthusiastic than any previous welcome. Why? Because this time the ambassador came to China with a particularly important mission and a particularly heavy responsibility, especially regarding the completeness and independence of China's sovereignty, there are deep and satisfactory expectations. Since China and Japan reached a consensus and determined peace, Japan's assistance to China has been tireless. However, like this time, the concessions that China has been invaded for a hundred years are resolutely returned. This has never been as generous and sincere as this time. Therefore, I say that the ambassador's mission is particularly important. Since Japan has given this precious gift to China, the recipient of the gift must not just bow a few times and say a few words of thanks. They must understand the meaning of the gift-giver, solemnly decorate it, arrange it, and use it. If there is any slight damage or waste, it would betray the gift-giver's good intentions, and what face would they have to see him? As for the gift-giver, of course, they must help to the end. For example, if you give someone a machine, if they don't know how to assemble it, you should provide them with the assembly materials, or if they don't know how to use it, you should guide them on how to use it. In the years of the Republic of China, that is, in the years of Taisho 12 and 13, Japan also gave a huge gift, that is, the war loan, the unsecured loan, amounting to more than 300 million. This was handled by Minister Hikoki, but unfortunately, the Beijing government used most of it for extravagance and waste, which increased the burden on the people. Not only were they not grateful, but they blamed Japan for not lending to the government, so until today, not a penny has been repaid. This is such a pity. Therefore, I say that the ambassador's responsibility is particularly heavy. Taking advantage of this opportunity that is not easy to obtain, I wish the completeness and independence of China's sovereignty ten thousand years, Japan's leading Pan-Asianism ten thousand years, and at the same time, I wish Ambassador Gu good health and happiness."</p>
<p>Message to Chairman: President Wang Jingwei of the National Government, since January 9 of this year, when the National Government resolutely declared war, the friendly nation of Japan, mindful of our country's determination to cooperate with Japan, has made great efforts to assist our country in moving towards the bright path of freedom and independence. First, it returned the Japanese-administered concessions in China, and then assisted our country in taking over the Beijing embassy area, as well as the French-administered concessions in Tianjin, Wuhan, and Guangzhou. Recently, it signed an agreement to return the Shanghai Public Concession, which is now scheduled to be officially recovered on August 1. From then on, the source of British and American aggression against our country for a hundred years has been eradicated. All our people are encouraged and celebrated by this great achievement of the National Government's diplomacy. Our association would like to pay tribute to the great leader on behalf of the people, and pledge to work with one heart and one mind under the leadership of the Chairman to support diplomacy, in order to complete the great mission of revitalizing China and defending East Asia. Therefore, at the grand meeting to welcome Japanese Ambassador to China Gu Zhengzhi, we send a telegram of respect. China National Foreign Affairs Promotion Association.</p>
<p>Message to Friendly Nation: (1) To His Excellency Prime Minister Tojo of the Cabinet, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the international situation has been completely renewed. In order to show our country's sincere cooperation and mutual support with your country, the National Government resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States on January 9 of this year. In the past half year, not only have the remaining forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia been completely swept away, but also the source of imperialist aggression against our country for a hundred years has been lost one after another. With the assistance of your government, the National Government has been able to abolish the unequal treaties and recover the concessions of various countries. From then on, our country has been able to enjoy the happiness of true independence and freedom. All our people are grateful for your country's sincere assistance and send a respectful telegram. China National Foreign Affairs Promotion Association.</p>
<p>(2) To His Excellency Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, since the National Government declared war, international relations have entered a new stage, especially since your Excellency has been in charge of foreign affairs, Sino-Japanese friendship has become more clear. Fortunately, with the enthusiastic assistance of your government, the recovery of the concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights have been realized one after another. Recently, the agreement to recover the Shanghai Public Concession was signed. The source of British and American imperialist aggression against our country for a hundred years has been eradicated at once. From then on, our country's sovereignty is completely independent, and the territory is once again complete. This shows that since your Excellency has been in power, there has been great progress in Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. The good news has spread, and the whole country is rejoicing. Today, at the grand meeting to welcome your country's Ambassador Gu Zhengzhi, all our people deeply appreciate your Excellency's sincere assistance and send a special telegram of respect. China National Foreign Affairs Promotion Association.</p>

<p>The fourth installment of rationed oil for this city, including the Nanshi, Huxi, and Pudong districts, was already launched for sale by the Edible Oil Trade Wholesale Office on the 28th of last month.

It is now learned that, in order to meet the urgent needs of the public, the office has made a special effort to allocate the delivered goods to retail stores in the concession areas in advance and is scheduled to begin selling them gradually starting today, the 10th. However, a portion of the goods has not yet been fully delivered and will need to be postponed for a few days. It is reported that the oil being sold is all raw oil, priced at 21.42 yuan per jin. Each person is still limited to four liang, priced at 5.355 yuan. For the sale of oil in the Public Concession, spring housing damage tickets and citizen certificates are required.

<h3 id="e39">Electrician Addicted to Drugs Arrested for Stealing Electric Wires; Investigation of Electrical Theft Using Replacement Wire Not Yet Completed, Hearing Postponed <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Iron Wire Factory at 610 Xujiahui Road, French Concession, is owned by Zhu Duanlin from Chuansha. In recent years, due to the war, imported goods have been cut off, so the business has seen abnormal growth and has made considerable profits, accumulating assets of over ten million yuan. However, the factory's products, which are iron wire and wire nails, are manufactured using electric motors, consuming huge amounts of electricity each month, reaching 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Last winter, Zhu wanted to save on electricity costs and discussed it with his friend Lu Jiamao (37 years old, from Shanghai, currently serving as the No. 8 Chief Inspector at the French Tram and Electric Lighting Company). Lu turned to his colleague Ding Ziwen for a solution, who then contacted Liu Guangyu (40 years old, from Nanjing), a lamp repairman at the company, to arrange the theft of electricity at the Shanghai Iron Wire Factory. They were able to reduce electricity costs by more than 20,000 yuan per month, and Zhu would give a monthly reward of over 5,000 yuan, which Lu, Ding, and Liu divided among themselves. However, Liu was addicted to drugs, and his monthly expenses were huge, exceeding his income. He then came up with another idea: a few days ago, he stole dozens of pounds of electric wire from the Electric Lighting Company and sold it for money to support his habit. This was discovered by Inspector Yu Wenzhi and detective Shao Guanrong of the French Police. Liu was arrested and confessed to the previous situation. Lu was also arrested, and Zhu Fuchang, an employee of the Shanghai Iron Wire Factory, was also apprehended. However, factory owner Zhu Duanlin and Electric Lighting Company employee Ding Ziwen had already fled upon hearing the news. Yesterday, the police escorted Liu, Lu, and Zhu to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The police lawyer stated that there were other accomplices in the case who had not yet been apprehended and that the investigation was not yet complete, requesting a postponement of the hearing. The court briefly questioned the defendants and approved the postponement, and the defendants were taken into custody.</p>

<p>According to the *North China Daily News*, recently, many people have been using the entrances on Haig Road or Avenue Foch as shortcuts through the Jing'an Temple Road Cemetery, greatly disturbing the peace of the cemetery. The Municipal Council announced yesterday that "only the Jing'an Temple Road entrance will be opened in the future, and the other gates will be kept locked. In the past, some people have used the cemetery for picnics or private gatherings. In the future, the authorities have authorized the cemetery gatekeepers to refuse entry to anyone deemed suspicious. The cemetery must be kept absolutely quiet and peaceful and must not be used as a place for recreation. This is the authorities' intention."</p>

<h3 id="e42">Prescribing the Right Remedy <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The economic illness of Shanghai, due to the rampant rise of material prices for days on end, is showing signs of being incurable. The seriousness of the current symptoms lies in the fact that speculators are taking advantage of rumors to manipulate the market, manipulating grain prices and manipulating the transactions of "heated red goods," thereby affecting general prices and leaving the people in dire straits.</p>
<p>We have repeatedly pointed out how speculators use rice and gold as tools to stimulate price increases, hoping that the authorities will take effective temporary countermeasures without the slightest leniency. Sure enough, in one of the policies of prescribing the right remedy, Shanghai's economic symptoms seem to have improved slightly in the last two days: due to the arrest of a large number of unscrupulous rice merchants, rice prices have begun to fall; due to the inspection of American and French banks and money houses, the black market for heated red goods has gradually calmed down; in addition, in order to stop unscrupulous merchants from raising rice prices, investigators have been secretly dispatched to investigate various markets, companies, and shops; in order to strictly prevent shops from illegally profiting, measures have been taken to crack down on substandard weights and measures; therefore, unscrupulous merchants have become wary these days and have become slightly restrained. However, such temporary countermeasures, like stimulants, are only effective for a short time, and the fundamental strategy of thoroughly investigating unscrupulous elements depends on the all-seeing eyes of the Materials Investigation Committee; it is reported that the current object of its work is to thoroughly uncover hoarding; according to our ideals, thoroughly uncovering hoarding should be combined with a thorough inspection of all associations in the city. Moreover, the hoarded goods found in various warehouses should be purchased by the state at a fair price and used to distribute to the people, in order to alleviate the shortage of materials.</p>

<p>The Materials Investigation Committee, since its establishment, has now scattered its offices in the Racecourse. It has begun to actively conduct investigations into hoarded materials. Yesterday, a person in charge of the committee said:</p>
<p>This committee is a joint organization of Sino-Japanese related agencies and the authorities of the Shanghai Public Concession. The liaison meeting of investigators is to seek contact and exchange of opinions between the investigative work of both China and Japan, and there is no fact of electing permanent investigators. Moreover, there were many errors in the newspaper report yesterday regarding the names of the investigators and the organizations to which they belong. The attached list of Chinese and Japanese investigators is now added below. List of Investigators: Feng Yixian (Ministry of Finance), Xia Tingzheng (Ministry of Industry), Lu Tianyou (Supervisory Office of the Business Administration Committee), Wang Ruming (Municipal Government), Yu Wusheng (Economic Bureau of the Municipal Government), Zhu Yaokun (Police Bureau of the Municipal Government), Shigetoku Kojima (Materials Control Committee of the Municipal Council), Susumu Mitsushima (Materials Control Committee of the Municipal Council), Akiyoshi Kanezumi (Police Headquarters of the Municipal Council), Morio Umemoto (Police Headquarters of the Municipal Council), Shojiro Anan (Army Military Police Headquarters), Shinobu Ogoshi (Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy), Akihiko Akasu (Japanese Consulate General).</p>

<p>Dr. Kimura, advisor to the Central Reserve Bank, went to Tokyo for official business in mid-June and returned to Shanghai on the 7th of this month. On the 8th, he gave a speech in which he discussed price countermeasures. The main points were as follows: "The Central Government is giving very detailed consideration to the new policy. If it is beneficial to China, it will go all out regardless of anything, and its determination is very strong. The Tokyo side is also paying close attention to the rising prices in Shanghai. The fundamental solution to the price problem must be sought in the 'materials' aspect. However, it is currently impossible to immediately transport large quantities of materials from other regions. As a result, methods to promote the exchange of materials between Shanghai and the inland areas to suppress rising prices have not been considered. In my personal opinion, at present, effective price countermeasures can only be studied in the financial aspect, that is, apart from 'materials.' The main purpose of this trip to Tokyo is to do this. If we can find a way to eliminate the instability of the currency, it seems to be a very effective shortcut. Advisor Yuto also agrees with this. In addition, the Union Bank's credit loan has been understood by the Central Government and can be signed. The amount has not yet been announced and is a mutual agreement between the Central Reserve Bank and the Union Bank."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Chamber of Commerce usually convenes an annual meeting once a year. It is reported that the Chamber will hold its second general meeting of member representatives in the middle of this month. All trade associations in Shanghai must send representatives to participate. Moreover, since the government promulgated the Provisional Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations, many of the original associations in the city have been reorganized, and many new associations have also been established. Therefore, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has specially printed a large number of forms, instructing reorganized associations and new associations to fill them out in detail and complete membership procedures. These forms must be submitted before the meeting.</p>
<p>Chinese Stock Trends: Yesterday, Chinese stocks continued the upward trend of the previous day, with widespread and sharp increases. The number of new investors has suddenly increased. This is because idle funds from the silk yarn industry have returned. Moreover, the resumption of business by the Chinese Stock Exchange has stimulated the upward momentum in all quarters. The Da Zhonghua Match Company's stock rose the most, suddenly breaking through a major barrier. The Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company followed suit and jumped higher. The Yong'an Department Store also saw a sharp rise, while the Xinxin and Guohuo Department Stores had a smaller rise. The Nei Yi Department Store suddenly rose by more than one yuan, and the Jingfu Shirt and Socks Company broke through another barrier. The Jinglun Department Store continued to rise. In the textile industry, Yong'an Textile flew out of another barrier. Dasheng Factories 1, 3, and Rongfeng Textile, and Xinhe Yarn Factory followed the trend and rose. The transaction prices of Xinfeng Printing and Dyeing and Guoxin Dyeing and Weaving were all high. Da Zhonghua Weaving was the only one that showed weakness. In the new pharmaceutical industry, Xinya, Zhongfa, and Xinyi were all bought up. The asking prices for the culture industry Shangwu, Zhonghua, and Shijie were also high. In the public utilities industry, Zhabei Water and Electricity and Huashang Electric all rose by several yuan. Jiu'an Industrial and Tongyi Trust showed a steady trend. Kangyuan Canned Goods and Defeng Knitting were relatively stagnant. Xinyi Real Estate has been firm recently. There were few sales in the financial industry until the end of the day.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Return of the Concessions and Shanghai's Economic Problems: The Seriousness of the Price Problem <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>If you ask Shanghai citizens for their opinions on the return of the concessions, nine out of ten people will talk about the price problem first, which shows how serious the price problem is. This return of the concessions, regardless of whether it is related to the surge in prices, is a goodwill measure based on the spirit of righteousness by the Japanese side, and it is not a temporary expedient measure for China, but contains a permanent significance. This year is a decisive year. At this important time, we cannot underestimate the people's livelihood issues of building the center of Shanghai in the future, and we cannot underestimate the price problem at the center of the people's livelihood issues. Especially the main reason for this round of price increases is due to political rumors. These rumors not only disrupt the economy, but also have the worst impact on Shanghai's political security. The so-called task of reorganizing Shanghai can only have a bright future by concentrating all efforts to solve the extremely serious price problem and the hoarding problem. After the establishment of the new Shanghai and the municipal government, the solution to this problem will be swift and clear. People say that the hoarding punishment order is the most effective political effect at this time. In short, the Shanghai municipal problem in the future, whether it is official governance or civil governance, the most important thing is to resolutely implement the price stabilization policy, and the full cooperation of officials and people is necessary to promote it to achieve satisfactory results. The political significance of the return of the concessions should be emphasized, and at the same time, the necessity of implementing emergency measures for the people's livelihood also lies in this.

<h3 id="e48">Comments from a Knowledgeable Source: Ambassador Tani Elaborates on the New Policy <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the National Diplomacy Promotion Association held a tea party to entertain Japanese Ambassador to China Tani Masayuki. Although Ambassador Tani has been in China for almost two months, he has been busy dealing with diplomatic affairs and has rarely had time to stay in Shanghai. This time, he has the opportunity to meet with people from all walks of life in Shanghai, especially to participate in the reception of the folk diplomacy group, which is of even greater significance.</p>
<p>After reading Ambassador Tani's speech, the first impression we get is that the ambassador's sincere words enhance our confidence in the authenticity of the new policy. Because when Japan's new policy towards China was decided, the ambassador was serving as foreign minister and was naturally an important figure who participated in the decision. Now he is the person who is actually responsible for implementing the new policy. Therefore, we feel that the ambassador's words are particularly sincere and authentic.</p>
<p>Japan's new policy towards China has already gone beyond the promotion of words and language and has reached the stage of practical work, showing in every way the factual, sincere, and concrete manifestations. How should we also accept it in fact and accept it sincerely? In other words, the true meaning of Japan's new policy is to help China achieve complete sovereignty, freedom, and independence. So, how should we show the strength to maintain complete sovereignty, freedom, and independence? The expression of strength requires political clarity and economic adjustment. These are of course the unshirkable responsibility of our government, and the people often actively cooperate and urge.</p>
<p>Rice Joint Operation Actively Purchases Rice; 20,000 Stones of White Rice Expected to Arrive in Shanghai Today; Efforts Underway to Replenish Household Rice Allocation</p>
<p>Dozens of specialists dispatched by the Rice Joint Operation to 13 rice-producing areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to purchase rice have achieved great success in the past week. Most have already negotiated with the local authorities and are waiting to be shipped to Shanghai.</p>
<p>20,000 Bags of Rice Expected to Arrive Today: Yesterday, reporters learned from the Joint Operation that a portion of Suzhou rice, about 20,000 bags, is expected to arrive today and be unloaded at the industry wharfs in the Suzhou River. The second batch of rice shipped to Shanghai has also been shipped from Songjiang and Jiaxing and is expected to arrive in the coming days. The rest are also on their way to Shanghai. As for the rice in other areas, it may arrive sooner or later. However, due to the temporary shortage of sacks, it cannot be shipped. The Joint Operation has borrowed more than 100,000 sacks from the Central Branch Rice Grain Association and distributed them to various rice-producing areas for use. It is predicted that the rice harvested in various places can reach Shanghai within a week.</p>
<p>Municipal Grain Bureau Contacts to Borrow Rice: In order to replenish the household rice allocation, the Grain Bureau is currently negotiating with the Central Branch Rice Grain Allocation Association to give priority to the city with the association's hundreds of thousands of stones of stored rice. If this matter is satisfactorily resolved, the rice supply in the city will be more than sufficient, and the future of the people's food supply can be more optimistic.</p>
<p>Next Allocation of Household Rice Planned at Two Sheng: According to relevant sources, the next allocation of household rice will be restored to two sheng. It is estimated that at least 500,000 stones of rice collected from various places will arrive in Shanghai before the 15th of this month, and this rice is all pure national rice. Therefore, the rice reserves in the Shanghai market will be extremely abundant in the future, which is clearly evidenced by the sharp drop in black market rice prices in recent days.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Japanese Embassy's Director Hirota Discusses Establishing an East Asian Economic System <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Hirota, Director of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office, at the regular meeting hosted by the three overseas authorities in Shanghai yesterday (the 9th) at 3:00 PM for the local Chinese press corps, fully elaborated on establishing an economic system for East Asian nations and eliminating the economic influence of Britain, America, and the Netherlands in East Asia.</p>
<p>Unite and Strengthen. Director Hirota of the Information Department first stated: "This time, the Kakakushi Civilian Economic Mission, including Mr. Ogura and his party, has come to China from Tokyo to hold sincere discussions with the Chinese government, public figures, and economic circles. At this time when China and Japan are increasingly cooperating closely to jointly build a new order in East Asia, the mission of this group is especially anticipated by us in terms of economic cooperation for building a new order in East Asia. The content of building a new order in East Asia is to unite the ethnic groups of Greater East Asia, jointly build a group of nations, and cooperate with each other to seek the free and independent development of each ethnic group. This is a necessary trend in politics today."</p>
<p>Fundamental Key Points. Regarding the economic exploitation by Britain, America, and the Netherlands, taking the Dutch East Indies as an example, resources like rubber and tropical products are abundant, with annual exports reaching 400 million yuan and imports at 300 million yuan. However, the surplus of 100 million yuan is transferred by the Dutch East Indies authorities to their own country's private pockets. Furthermore, regarding rubber production in Malaya and the Dutch East Indies, their output accounts for 90% of the world's total, amounting to hundreds of thousands of tons annually, which is also occupied by Britain and the Netherlands. In addition, gasoline is monopolized by British and American gasoline trusts, wantonly exploiting the interests of our East Asian nations. The above two examples expose this without reserve. We must eliminate this and engage in production increase with our own land and labor, revitalizing the people's livelihood. This is the fundamental key point for building a new order in East Asia.</p>
<p>Reasonable Resolution. To correct this contradictory phenomenon in the world economy, Japan has always used peaceful means to request that all countries in the world adhere to the three major principles of free immigration, equal distribution of resources, and free trade, but has been met with military oppression from Britain and America. Therefore, Japan resolutely declared war on Britain and America to fight for the liberation and free independence of the East Asian nations. Now we must establish a new economic system to defeat their economic organizations and establish a strong military force as the current priority.</p>
<p>Revitalize People's Livelihood. At the same time, we must doubly consider the methods we have always considered. Re-establish the East Asian economic theory. Britain and America have always relied on theoretical propaganda to defeat the world economy, and take the gold standard as the principle. However, the theory of Greater East Asia economy takes organization as the principle, striving to recover all industries in East Asia, and seeking to replace the gold standard with managed currency, and based on our own labor, the cooperation between China and Japan's economies can be perfectly established. And the ethnic groups of the whole of East Asia can also develop beautifully. In other words, all the resources and industries on the East Asian land are developed and produced by the labor of the East Asian nations, and revitalizing the livelihood of the East Asian nations is the most important and urgent task at present.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Appearance and Clothing <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Yale</p>
<p>"Buddhas need gold plating, and people need clothing." In fact, people not only need clothing, but appearance is also quite important. Therefore, people with dignified appearances and proper attire always seem to have a triumphant air and can easily take advantage everywhere. Moreover, they can easily gain people's favor. This is probably due to the prevailing social atmosphere. No wonder some people resort to cosmetic surgery or constantly apply oil to their hair and powder to their faces, even sparing no expense to make several sets of expensive clothes; they would rather save on food and clothing, but the facade cannot be compromised.</p>
<p>Everyone has a love for beauty. It is certainly excusable to dress up and groom oneself, but if it is for the sake of vainglorious boasting or other purposes, then it is unacceptable. However, in reality, due to the influence of human relations and the temptation of appearances, those who like to dress up and embellish themselves are generally bound to have elements of "ill intentions." Precisely because of this, those who are "strong on the outside but weak on the inside" and "have a golden and jade exterior but are filled with rotten cotton inside" are indeed numerous.</p>
<p>The clay sculptures and wood carvings we often see can be praised as "powerful and majestic," and can make "pious men and women" reverently worship, even believing that they are "responsive to every request." However, clay sculptures and wood carvings are, after all, clay sculptures and wood carvings, fundamentally without human pain.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "You can't judge a book by its cover." This is indeed based on experience, because "a dignified appearance" does not necessarily mean a good person, and a kind face does not necessarily mean a good heart. Moreover, today's friendly face may turn into an enemy's face tomorrow. Other situations, such as "a clever face but a stupid belly" and "a smiling tiger," have probably been encountered by those with some social experience.</p>
<p>As for clothes, they are external possessions that can be changed at any time. Apart from the relationship of "valuing clothes over people," they seem to have little to do with one's personality and status. Thus, "scoundrels in official attire" can be mixed together.</p>
<p>In fact, regarding a person's appearance, as long as their features are regular, their ears can distinguish "right from wrong" and "black from white"… regarding clothing, as long as it is neat and generous, without pursuing vanity… if one goes against this, then they are definitely not an upright person.</p>
<h3 id="e53">"Squeezing" and "Yielding" <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Shan Wen</p>
<p>At the entrance of tobacco shops and in front of South Goods stores, there are often crowds of people. They are there to buy cigarettes and scoop up white sugar. Because there are so many people and everyone wants to quickly smoke their cigarettes and sweeten their mouths, they all exert their strength and desperately "squeeze" forward. Moreover, everyone is "ten times more energetic."</p>
<p>Once someone gets crushed or the glass is broken, everyone immediately turns into "defeated generals," fearing that they will suffer a loss and become "unlucky." So they push and shove, anyway, "it's none of my business if someone dies." They can very well ignore it.</p>
<p>This is not only the attitude of everyone when buying cigarettes and receiving white sugar, but also the philosophy of life for most people.</p>
<p>Everyone starts from a position of "selfishness and self-interest." So as long as something is good for themselves, they will do everything they can to pursue it, often harming others without hesitation.</p>
<p>Conversely, if something is a bit disadvantageous to them or "laborious without reward," then no matter how much benefit it would bring to the public if they did it, they will "watch the fire from the other shore." You are anxious, but I am not. This creates the concept of "everyone sweeps the snow from their own doorstep, and doesn't care about the frost on other people's roofs."</p>
<p>Is this the "truth" (?) of today's society?</p>

<p>— Shen Shen</p>
<p>Chief Lu Jia was also thinking about this, and it was really difficult. To say that using money to release the person back, then this little bit of money is not enough. If he uses more money, then this point is already everything that Ah Kun has. He looked at Mayor Li and Staff Officer Zhang, who both seemed to be lost in thought, and he interjected: "We all understand this matter. First, Ah Kun is really poor, and you can't squeeze oil out of him. We need to ask Staff Officer Zhang to bite the bullet and speak well to the commander. Second, although we are the mayor and chief of this place, we don't want to do things in the middle of the night that we don't want to do in our conscience. We need to ask the commander to think it through thoroughly. Local customs can't be made too bad. It's already late. Please ask Staff Officer Zhang to go talk to the commander! We'll wait here." Encouraged by Chief Lu Jia, Staff Officer Zhang hesitated for a moment, then slowly turned around and walked out, saying:</p>
<p>"Let me try. If it doesn't work, I can't help it either." Turning a corner, he walked straight to the commander's office. Pushing open the door, he saw Commander × was bent over the table counting stacks of banknotes. Seeing Staff Officer Zhang approaching, he hurriedly covered the stack of banknotes with a piece of newspaper. He said:</p>
<p>"How is it? How much money are they willing to pay? I think these two guys don't understand official business. Just now, they were rambling on and on with a lot of senseless words. If our troops hadn't arrived today, I would have slapped them twice and then talked." After saying this, Commander × seemed very angry. He stood up and crossed his hands behind his back, pacing back and forth. Staff Officer Zhang was a little hesitant in his heart. If he said the amount, he would definitely be scolded because he knew how big his appetite was. If he didn't say it, it wouldn't work. He was really embarrassed for a while, and finally said:</p>
<p>"Commander! This is the first time I've encountered this kind of thing. The one who was arrested is a well-known pauper in this village and has just recovered from a serious illness. I talked a lot with Mayor Li and the others, and I really can't think of a solution. However, according to the rules of our headquarters, we always have to save face. Later, Mayor Li said that he could only think of a way to…" Staff Officer Zhang hesitated and didn't continue.</p>
<p>"How much? How much?" Commander × asked impatiently.</p>
<p>"Uh! Six… six hundred… six hundred yuan." Staff Officer Zhang finally said honestly. After saying this, he lowered his head. Commander × heard this, jerked his head back violently, turned to look at Staff Officer Zhang intently, stopped pacing, and said:</p>
<p>"Humph! Is there such a cheap thing in the world? Ridiculous! I, ×, have been doing this for so many years, and I've never had such a joke before… Ridiculous!" Commander × expressed his feelings very angrily. (8)</p>
