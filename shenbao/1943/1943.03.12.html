<p>社評</p>
<h3>植樹與植人</h3>
<p>一年一度的植樹節，全國各機關團體都有植樹的運動。從植樹的意義而言；實是一種積極性與建設性的遝動，決不是少數人的附庸風雅，或點綴令節的舉動。所以就應該　大成爲羣衆的運動，由植樹而擴大護林與造林運動。我們不僅要保護先人墳墓的蔭林，並且要保護各地的山林園木，要大量的栽植新林；在增加國富，促進農業與水利，是有重大意義的。但由植樹，却不能不使我們聯想到更嚴重的植人問題，由護林造林問題，更聯想到謢材與造材問題。</p>
<p>從中國歷史來看，每一代學術文化的燦爛，必由於國家社會對於人材的愛護與培養。中國學術的發展，以宋與明爲最著，而考究宋之二程朱陸，明之王文成公輩，所以能造成一時的國士風氣者，實由於國有太舉國子監之設。地方則廣置學校，供給師生膏火，以爲培養人才之用。而宋明的書院，尤爲培養學術的中心，宋時書院如白鹿，嶽麓，都爲政府所創辦，亦有由熱心的社會人士創辦者。明時王陽明先生手創書院多所，蔚爲一代學府，進書院的學生，不但供給本人的衣食膏火，連他們的家屬，都由政府賜給米祿。但是，反觀今日一般文化人所受的待遇爲如何？今日有志硏究學術之士，不但自身的口腹，亟待解決；還有五六口或七八口之家累；加以今日之爲學，不如昔人之只須抱一經一藝，有書籍三五箱，即可埋頭窗下，十年成名：而必須洞達天下大勢，精求專門之學，其難易實有小可同日而語者。由於今日學校費用的昂貴，學校設置的不普遍，多數靑年都有失學之苦。間有靠祖宗餘蔭，親友援助者，縱不因英美式的敎法，而成英美式的典型人物，亦必爲小考大考，磨得天昏地暗，對於學術之深湛的硏究，只有望洋興嘆。在戰前雖有幾個研究院，獎勵研究，頗著成績，但事變以來，縱有存在，惟以物價飛漲，硏究人士無法維持生活，雖對學術研究有萬丈雄心，亦不能不爲生活壓迫而與世奔逐了。舉目四顧，今日可稱爲人材培養塲所者，究有多少？成績如何？如果一面械樹成蔭，而一面有人材寥落之感，這豈是國家民族之幸？</p>
<p>因此，我們今日特再大聲疾呼，希望政府重視植人大計。第一，是對於現有人材文物的愛護，切勿輕易糟塌人才，縱有思想不正及以往言行不盡純正者，祗須爲可造之材，即宜使盡所力於學術硏究，且加以保護，勿任其凋殘萎棄。其次，進一步希望政府擴大培植人材運動，今日政府財力雖然有限，要亦不能不專重敎育文化部門，蓋因一切政策之最後決定因素，只有「人材」二字。所以對於各敎育文化機關經費之增加，敎育文化人員薪水之提高，以及確定各級學校學生之優待辦法，實爲當前不容或緩之事。此外，社會上有力人士，亦宜爲國家百年犬計着想，踴躍捐資，協助敎育文化事業，羣策羣力，培植人材。我們敢於斷言：只要政府愛才養才，倡導樹人於前，則社會有力人士，必可分任艱鉅於後。朝野不乏遠見之士，幸勿以老生常談，而忽視此大時代的基本工作。</p>
<p>譯論</p>
<h3>四屆總統與美國野心</h3>
<p>據外電所傳，美國民主黨全國委員會幹部會，以戰爭繼續至一九四四年爲條件，決定推薦羅斯福爲下屆總統選舉戰中的候補者。羅斯福對此並不表示任何意見，當然，他在最後的瞬間釗臨之前，將嚴守沉默，並靜候輿情的批判。這是他在一九四〇年三度當選時所用的手段。尤其在此次，爲了緩和彈劾敗績責任的空氣，這一種手段尤爲必要。</p>
<p>羅斯福能否四度被選，或政權將轉操於反對黨共和黨之手，將視本年的戰局情况以決定，今日殊未能加以預斷。但共和黨的領袖們，也曾聲述比民主黨更甚的侵略言辭，所以在兩黨的指導層之間，並沒有什麼本質的差異，殊堪注意。至少在目前這樣的情勢下，不問其政權的歸趨如何，美國的指導方針不會有根本的變化。即或有，也不過暗示將作戰略的後退而已。</p>
<p>海軍長官諾克斯，早已中張美國「兩洋艦隊」的不够，必須準備足以支配世界七大海洋的「七洋艦隊」。這制覇世界的野心，不是他們一流人的可笑的妄想，他雖備位於民主黨內閣，但原本是純粹的共和黨員，這共和黨就是惡辣的金元外交全盛時期當政的政權。我們應當記起滿洲事變時史汀生的强硬政策失敗後，暫時在戰略上後退　東亞政策的經過。</p>
<p>但是美國這色厲內荏的外貌中，也可以看出現在指導層的焦慮。戰事如像現狀這樣地拖延下去，欲維繫民心至一九四四年的選舉，是不可能的，今年戰局的推移，及來冬生活的困難，將成爲美國民衆是否在選舉中爆發其對指導者不滿的分水嶺。今年是決戰年，我們應明確認識美國二大政黨指導者的野心何在，嚴爲警戒，絕不能陷於希望的觀測。（翔：譯自三月六日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>今日本船的重要性　大阪商船副社長神田外茂夫著</h3>
<p>承平時代，海運在經濟，產業，文化以及其他各方面國力進展上，當然都起着極重要的作用，這是不言而喩的；但在戰時，船隻不僅絕對需要，且必然大量需要，這是大家所知道的。</p>
<p>尤共在此次大東亞戰爭期間，我國竟在廣漠無垠的地城內進行作戰，且隨着佔領區的日益擴大，而必然更日益要求海運能力的增强，所以船隻無論有多少，而總感覺不足。</p>
<p>因此我國的中心任務，　用全副精神製造船隻；然而若想製造現在航行中的鋼船，這在各種產業部門中是具有最複雜的工業形態，例如建造船舶一艘，則必須十數種資材以及二千餘種類的部份品，且此類部份品如一件不足，則無論如何努力，終不能有所成就。</p>
<p>在戰前這類資村與部份品多半求之於國外，但目前已經來源斷絕，雖然在國內極力節省消費，而國內各種工程有增無已，需要頻繁，且鋼船的需求突飛猛進，這實在靴於應付。</p>
<p>增加生產鋼船，雖然非常困難，然一面必須克服船隻的不足與排除任何困難，我們因處於必須高度發揮海運能力的時代裏，從事於海運業者，就急切地要求製造木船，決心拚命正式大量製造木船，以求航運能力的向上與增進。</p>
<p>遠在十九世紀的中葉，所製造的只有木船，但日本稱作「御朱印船」等的木船，曾遠渡重洋。後來發明煉鐵法，則曾建造木鐵合造船，鐵船，以至逐漸發展到今天的鋼船。從三四十年前開始，木船的使用則一年减少一年，近幾年來，除了少數小型船外，簡直是絕無僅有了。然而在戰時，由於鋼鐵必然地不能滿足需求，而木船的出現，這是自然道理。根據這種觀念，我們現在仍然心中隱隱作痛，爲什麼在中國事變當初，沒有積極建造木船。</p>
<p>一直到今天，普通人還似乎在輕視木船的運輸力，然而這是一個很大的錯誤。在航運範圍上雖然有差異，但應用於沿岸航路方面，其運輸力眞有不可輕侮的地方。我們正當迫切要求船隻急劇增加的時代，木船取鋼船而代之，這在各方面都賜與非常有利的條件。</p>
<p>例如對於建造木船，差不多絕無資材不足的現象，勞動力不足也能够克服過來，尤其在造船時日上還大可縮短，綜合這幾點，而若加以高度合理化，則我敢斷言大量生產是決不難的事情。</p>
<p>此次我們大阪商船公司，首先大量生產這一木船的原因，一個就是由於各方面底用途逐漸擴大，另外一個就是由於我們對於這一企業，始終不以生意眼作前提，不以公司的利害觀點作前提，而只想努力於戰時海遝底充實，就是在這種堅强的决心下開始的。</p>
<p>因此我們公司按多年所積得經馱和技術，從事多方面的硏究，首先爲了物色生產地點而走遍全國，結果則認爲石川縣七星港爲最適宜的地方，於是便決定在此大事生產。</p>
<p>該地雖然在表面上似乎有不大方便的感覺，但在實質上，按地形，資材，勞力等各方面的條件，比較其他地方總可以說是最完備的，且在幕府時代的末年，曾是加賀藩幕府的海軍迭船所，也曾是日本迭船界的發祥地。</p>
<p>後來，這一造船所就成爲川崎造船所的前身。由於時代的再度變更，擔負這次大戰使命的我們公司，用五百萬圓資本而開始從事大量生產木船，在我們造船業方面看，認爲是具有很多歷史意義的。</p>
<p>公司在木船生產之外，還在航運方面取得横的密切聯絡，以資金一千萬圓成立木船航運公司，於是在縱的生產方面，横的海運方面，都取得有機合理的聯繫，以嶄新的姿態，在自己海運本位工作上，積極於執行大戰下的使命。</p>
<p>幸而我們政府，最近也開始努力從事於大量生產木船，對於製造標準木船和鋼船一樣，都與以低利資金的通融貸款，正在這種嚴重時期，我們公司首先開始製造木船，眞是一件最光榮的偉績。</p>
<p>關於造船噸數以及其他，目前雖然還在審核中，但在海務院方面已經發表，標準木船　的噸數爲二百五十噸型，一百五十噸型，一百噸型等三種。因此公司目前正在用全副精神　，努力生產海務院所發表的二百五十噸型的戰時標準木船。</p>
<p>現在戰綫已經擴大到數萬海里的汪洋大海裏，所以即使一隻鋼船也應當用在海外，在這一意義上，木船航運的使命，當然更可以說是非常迫切和重大。（季：譯自二月號實業之世界）</p>

<h3>德國必勝態勢的分析　前綫後方配合決不蹈前次大戰覆轍</h3>
<p>德國全國爲準備即將到來的春季大攻勢，現正上下一致取着總動員的態勢，近頃納粹機關報就前次大戰及這次大戰中德國所處的情勢，由軍事，經濟，政治三者，比較檢討，其結論謂：敵方雖引用前次大戰之例，宣傳着德國這次仍將得勝於先而敗北於後。然而德國在前次大戰時勝利臨前而遭敗戰的痛苦經騐，在德國人的記憶中，猶是新鮮之事。故在這次大戰，決不再踏一九一八年失敗的覆轍，一心一意，向着戰勝之途邁進。</p>
<p>軍事情勢</p>
<p>前次大戰當時，德軍於西部戰綫，在法國北部進擊被阻，僅佔領法國的一部而已，比利時的一部亦在敵人手中，全法海岸及英法海峽，均在敵人支配之下，在亞爾薩斯方面，敵人尙且侵入德國的佔領地內，而荷蘭，丹麥，挪威則均保守中立。</p>
<p>反之，今日的德軍，已確保着自挪威至西班牙國境之全部大西洋岸。前次大戰中德國之最强的敵人法軍，現在已吿瓦解，法國的工業已在德國支配之下。而且　國潛艇，現在於技術上已大獲進步，正利用着全大西洋岸爲根據地。在南方，前次大戰時德奧軍會與意大利作戰，然而這次則意大利已爲我友。沒有法蘭西海軍存在的法國，意大利，希臘，葡萄牙之地中海岸，已在德意支配之下。羅馬尼亞在前次大戰時參加敵方，這次則已與我同盟，而且我正使用其出產的煤油。又前次成爲敵人補給地域的非洲，這次則日德意正與英美軍相戰於此，而把其兵力拘束於此。</p>
<p>又日本在前次大戰時，參加協約國方面，這次則成爲德國的盟邦，收得了赫赫的戰果，奪得了向爲敵人完全自由取用的重要資源，且以此等地域爲作戰根據地，威脅英美的生命綫，把美國的差不多全部艦隊並商船以及空軍的大部分，拘束於太平洋，同時在世界的全海上，與德國的潛艇戰協力着。在印度方面，英國非保有相當的兵力以防日本的攻擊不可。而澳洲的船舶及兵員，亦不能再如前次大戰當時，協力於歐洲戰塲了。</p>
<p>經濟資源</p>
<p>就糧食說，在前次大戰時，因着敵人的封鎖，曾引起不足的恐慌，當初的儲藏量爲猶太人不法操縱，分票制度的施行已遲，配給量逐漸减少，到了戰時下的第三年之冬，已陷於最悲慘的境地。然而在這次的大戰中，配給務求公正，同時確保着戰綫及後方的糧食，在第三年之冬，且施行着特別追加配給，由於獲得了蘇　之豐　的農業地域，確立了糧食的自由。</p>
<p>在這次大戰中，敵方的原料輸送狀態，其航路遠比前次大戰時長而迂迴，非要許多時間和護衛船艦以爲輸送不可。而且處處受到德國的潛艇和空軍之威脅。又在前次大戰當時敵的補給根據地，今已成爲德國海空軍的作戰根據地。在前次大戰中，敵人實際上使用着世界的全部船腹，（船腹係船舶的噸位及數量的總稱）然而現在日意兩國的船舶已不爲所用，而被德國佔領着的各國所有之大部分船腹並船渠，已爲德國所奪，故敵人差不多祇有其自己的船腹而已，非滿足其遠較前次爲大的需要不可。</p>
<p>政治情勢</p>
<p>在前次大戰當時，德國爲政黨政治的國家，缺少軍政指導的統一，最大政黨之社會民主黨，且自稱爲反國家的政黨，準備着無產附級的革命，甚至煽動軍需工廠的工人同盟罷工。而中央黨則與敵相通，奧匈國的皇帝又且密謀單獨媾和，使敵抱其戰勝的自信。與政黨柑提携的猶太人及互助團，（Freemasou）更跳梁於經濟界及各方面，策動德國的敗戰，政府力弱，對之亦無可如何。於戰後山祖國歸還之退伍兵的背囊，滿貼着反戰的傳單。這是當時的狀態。反之，今日的德國，在希特勒元首指導之下，軍政完全統一；以强力的指導力，向着戰勝少途邁進，敵的策動無隙可乘。（丁：譯自三月五日東京每日新聞）</p>

<p>短評</p>
<h3>組織全國商業統制總會</h3>
<p>國民政府爲確立戰時經濟體制，實施統制物資，集中管理起見，籌設全國商業統制總會。暫行條例，已經國防會議通過。而友邦方面，因實踐國府參戰後對　新政策，將辦理統制物資之職權，交還國府，促成是　新機構之成立，殊爲欣慰，該會已於昨日舉行首次籌備會，發起人包括金融業，紗業，百貨業，化學工業，烟草業等領袖，而以市商會代表爲中心。綜觀人選，均爲一時俊彥。定今日起草章則，將於明日第二次籌備會中，具體決定一切。人民盼望足以安定民生的有力機構之出現，正如大旱之望雲霓。而當局對於　機構之人事，更能集中民間優秀人才，完全爲事業前途着想，尤足欣幸。趁此成立之初，願貢蒭　之見：</p>
<p>（一）旣爲全國性之機構，則總會方面似應羅致全國各地有聲望，有才幹，公正廉介之人才。而各地分會，當羅致各該地方之第一流人才。</p>
<p>（二）理事長人選，尤應愼重銓衡，以社會公認之公正人士爲上選。</p>
<p>（三）一切章則，立法必須周密，兼顧國家利益與商民便利。</p>
<p>（四）會務除必要保守秘密者外，應絕對公開，接受批評，以取得廣大階層之信賴，而自動協力。</p>
<p>（五）從前友邦辦理統制之優點，儘量保留採用，當然去其缺點，以期盡善盡美。</p>
<p>以上數點，僅爲一般之原則，深信新機構必能做到。其次，對於工業方面，其重要性實不亞於商業。希望不久之將來，亦有同樣性質，全國一致之機構設立，而完成整個戰時經濟體制。</p>

<h3>鎮海舟山島見聞記</h3>
<p>鎮海，寗波，舟山島等地，是通臨東海的中國門戶，現在具有更新的性格，一天一天增加了它的　要性。尤其是對於上海爲甚，上海的生命綫，靠它維持。上海所欲得自大陸的物質，莫不取道上述各港島所轉運，借重於無數的帆船，由大陸渡東海而來。鎭海，舟山島而且是中國沿岸封鎖綫的根據地，也就是蘊藏無盡的最大漁塲，有着這樣價値，所以和上海處於不可分離的關係。記者所要說的新性格與重要性，就在這裏。但上海人士，並不重視這點。記者承艦隊報道部和該地駐屯海電部隊的協力，作一次短時間的旅行，所得實地見聞如下：</p>
<p>鎮海</p>
<p>民國二十六年（昭和十三年）八月日本駐華艦隊會發表斷然封鎖中國沿岸航行的宜言，截斷渝方海上通路，然而渝方還保有廣東，越南，緬甸等路綫，及來自鎭海的所謂寗波路綫，嗣後廣東，越南，緬甸等路綫，相繼爲日方切斷，僅賴一條貫通鎮海，寗波的浙贛路綫，因爲它的輸送能力龐大，所以就成了重慶的唯一偷運路綫，於是帆船與大型外國船舶，都蝟集其間。</p>
<p>所有來自該港島的武器，彈藥，直接可以培養第三戰區的戰鬥力，同時又爲從海路滋長重慶的命脈，在這種狀態之下，日軍當然不能默視。海軍陸戰隊，就在民國二十八年（昭和十四年）七月十六日，在海空一體作戰下，佔領了鎭海，覆滅其抗戰輸血路綫的根源，在達到使命之後，就自動退出。豈知當日軍撤離之後，此秘密路綫，竟又告活動，因之日軍在民國三十年四月十九日，再度攻佔其地，繼又抄過相距該地約八·九里的甬江，佔據寗波，將浙贛綫起點地，完全收諸掌握。所以該地被日軍佔領後，給予上海財政界的影響極大。同時如渝方所派遺於上海的藍衣社，以及搗亂後方的特　隊，本來都把該地作爲往返　綫，它的淪陷，使重慶對上海之特務工作無法進行。</p>
<p>舟山島</p>
<p>舟山島和鎭海，寗波，在地理上具有密切關係，是一個有數的貿易港，民國二十八年（昭和十四年）六月二十三日被日海軍陸戰隊所攻佔，舟山島的性質與其說是物質的集散地，母寗是著名的漁塲。日海軍佔領該地的最大目的，就是在於封鎖東海海上。而且舟山島北方的岱山島每年出產三百萬斤的食鹽。舟山島東方的普陀山，和山西的五台山，四川的峨嵋山，同、爲中國三大佛地之一，在歷史上極有名聲，從前和日本的交通往還，都要取道舟山島定海而行。所以在隧史上也是爲一般人關心的地方。</p>
<p>該島和定海並列，沈家門位於該島東方的盧家嶼，是附近漁業的集散地，商業反較縣城定海爲活潑，就是以援蔣物資的進出口而論，重要性也遠在定海之上。該島早爲英法所虎視，想把它作爲侵略據點。當西歷一八四〇年鴉片戰爭之際，英國將領蒲里瑪氏於是年六月率領艦艇二十六艘前往襲擊，佔定海，進而攻擊乍浦港，封鎖寗波，當上海沒有繁榮之前，英國會有使舟山島成爲第二香港的企圖，從上海至定　，計程一百三十二浬，如由寗波前往，祗有三十五浬，島內物產貧弱，食米供應不足，大約有四分之三取給於上海方面，在日軍未佔領前，該島和鎭海同爲重慶進出轉口點，也就是援蔣路的樞紐，但自日軍佔領該兩地以後，僅具有封鎖據點的價値，至論政治，經濟兩方，沒有什麽重要使命。</p>
<p>治安與行政</p>
<p>鎭海和舟山島，都山自治委員會施政，對日本海軍負責，無異爲絕對依賴海軍的地方，可是詳細的分別起來，有兩個不同點存在。查鎭海方面除了縣城之外，陸軍部隊也協力担　警備。但是舟山島以及其他附近諸島，完全由　軍部隊指導。鎭海縣自本年三月一日起，改隸國府浙東行政公署直轄，所以「鎭海目治委員會」就在其時解散，由前任會長改任縣長。但舟山島仍歸「定海自治委昌會」獨自施政，鎭海之改隸於浙東行政公署，無疑的是日方建設精神所致，在實質上和以前毫無二致。</p>
<p>鎭海行政區共計七個，第一，二，三，四區治安已經鞏固。至於第五，六，七區，還時常有盜匪出沒，未脫離掃蕩匪寇時代。出沒於該地的盜匪，自命爲「江北遊擊隊」，實則全係遊匪，毫無任何思　上組織，將他澈底掃蕩不過時間問顯而已。人口每月增加二·三百名，共計已有一萬七千名左右，不久就可以恢復戰前的二萬名人口，目下大體已恢復昔日的繁榮狀態。</p>
<p>舟山島方面的自治委員會，在本島，岱山島及其他各列島上，設有分會十五所，該羣島在統一的組織之下，總計人口約五十萬名，大小島嶼不下六七百個之多，治安都很良好，幾無遊匪蠢動的餘地。</p>
<p>自治委員會本身的警備力，最近已有顯著進步，除了警察約一千三白名外，　有憲警隊約一百名，負責維持治安。去年年底，渝方王繼能部隊在六横島獻身和運，業經改編爲保安隊，協力維持治安。同時民衆的自衛組織，也相當努力，和鎮海一樣組織了自警團，實施保甲制度，成績良好。該地的治安問題，就地理上看來，重心在於海上，但因最近和大陸生產地的交通臻密，恐怕反而引起常初的海盜横行，所以日海軍警備隊已準備萬全的對策。</p>
<p>各種建設進步</p>
<p>這一帶的建設，値得大書而特書的首推道路，蓋治安的穩固，生產的增加，直接得力於道路的建設，如鎭海方面，已築有貫通鎭海，寗波的寗鄞公路，全程約三十公里，業已大部竣工，預計至五月底可吿通車。這條公路完成後，可縮短寗波，鎭海間的距離，同時兩地經濟上發展，也有把握。此外警備上的必要道路，亦在不斷建築，單就鎮海日海軍部隊所新架設的橋樑而言，已達二十六座之多。</p>
<p>舟山島的建設，更爲積極，尤其是一條貫通全島的環島道路，更爲名貴。這條路是在前年歲底開工的，歷時約六個月，耗資達二百多萬，方始元工，對於確立舟山本島的治安有很多幫助。惜乎島民對於得自該路的好處，和提倡建設的精神，還欠缺充份認識，這眞遺憾得很。這一條長凡百數十公里的環島道路，已成爲安居樂業的基礎，目下還在設法加長距離，以便聯運。此外，像岱山島的鹽田警備道路，最近也在建設中，所以將來在鹽業的發展上，必能得到未可限量的效果。</p>
<p>除了道路建設之外，同時注意到教育文化方面，設立學校，圖書館，體育塲，一面積極修復電燈，電話等公用事業，更於增產建設上，擴大耕地，創辦合作社，及改良農業，推進植林事業。獎勵增產，實行小本貸款，尤其是改良漁業，和增加岱山島一帶的鹽業工作，增加了這一帶的重要性，可以斷定它未來的地位必然重要，目下關係方面正在研究一切發展計劃。</p>
<p>政治問題</p>
<p>鎭海，舟山島的立塲，一如上面所說，都是絕對依存海軍的，一切的設施，都以恢復戰前繁榮爲目的。現在這兩地，因地理關係的遠隔，所以和國民政府的關係極爲淺薄，國府並無任何直接指導或施策行使在這兩地，所以兩地民衆都覺得假使改隸國府之後，過去的旣定方針，或許有何變遷，同時有許多其他原因，所以不免有了疑慮。負責那一帶的日海軍當局，爲了不使國府加重負担起見，故而堅抱充實該地經濟力的方針，換句話說，在沒有得到經濟上自給自足之前，決定推進一切建設，努力生產，來供給上海的需要。（企靑：譯自三月十日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>工部局統制部長稻垣談　授油準備現況　數量種類正在積極接洽　居民需求迫切渴望實行</h3>

<p>將來售價　切實核定</p>

<h3>法屬越南全貌</h3>
<p>— 越人</p>
<p>（一）越南地理概況</p>
<p>越南又名安南，歐美人稱爲「印度支那」，位於印度支那半島的東部，北緯八度三〇分至二三度二〇分，東經一〇〇度至一〇九度三〇分，北部和我國的廣東廣西及雲南三省接壤，東及東南濱臨東京灣及南中國海，西界緬甸及泰國。面積共爲七十三萬七千餘平方公里的等於法國本國之一·三倍，日本本州的兩倍，我國折江省的七倍。</p>
<p>越南境內，有安南山脈斜貫，就是我國雲嶺的餘脈，南北有兩大平原在北部的是紅河下游的三角洲，稱東京平原；在南部的是湄公河下游的三角洲，稱交扯平原，都很肥沃，構成了越南優美的農國。河流以紅河和湄公河稱最大，發源都在我國，紅河就是元江，又名富良江，自　南東南流入越南，注於東京灣。湄公河就是瀾滄江，自　南南流，經過緬甸和泰國，入越南境，注於南中國海，</p>
<p>越南　海岸，大都率直，東　對南海，西南和馬來半島合包暹　灣，東北和我國的海南島，雷州半島，合圍成東京灣。重要港口，一爲東南海岸的芳蘭灣，在太平洋戰爭以前就爲日　登陸加以控制；二爲西貢，向爲法國遠東艦隊的根據地，同時又是一大商港，商業居全越第一位，爲　趾支那的首邑三爲土倫，一名會安，在越南舊都順化之南，也爲著名良港。四爲海防，一爲東京灣沿岸良港，不過一向更以商業港著名而已。</p>
<p>氣候因爲位居熱帶，燠暖多雨，造成爲農業發展的優良條件。不過北部高地冬季較凉爽，和我廣西雲南的南部完全相同。全年可分乾濕二季，四月到十月爲濕季，十一月至次年三月爲乾季。但季候風常會引起危險的雨水降落量的不規則性，許多河流，在季候風的雨水期，强有力的擴大了，成爲灌溉，及水力的强大來源。</p>
<p>除去高山地區以外，都是豐盛的熱　植物的繁殖地，漫山遍野，都是奇奇怪怪的森林，其中有很貴重的樹木。但有很大的幅圓，是不健康的流行瘟熱的，沼澤性的叢林。</p>
<p>河內是法屬越南的首都，也是東京省的首邑，法國派任的總督，常駐於此，統轄全境。市區在紅河的右岸，爲鐵路和公路的中心，貿易相當繁盛。特別是在七七事變以後，滇越鐵路尙未斷絕以前，其繁榮情形，更曾受人垂涎，此外著名的大城市，就是海防，西貢，堤岸，順化和　埔寨的首邑南旺，即百囊奔，一名金邊城的。</p>
<p>越南的人口。並不多，據一九三六年的調查，爲二千三百餘萬人，即　一平方公里爲三一·一人口茲將人口之分佈狀况，列表如下：</p>
<p>（依據和田義隆「甫洋之新知識」）</p>
<p>人口發展之形勢，可視下表：</p>
<p>（依據一九四三年同盟社「世界往何處」）</p>
<p>越　居民中，大部份是安南人，屬於蒙古利亞種，因爲久受我國文化薰陶，所以風俗習慣，也都相同。其中還有不少漢人與安南人的混合種。由於這種情形，我們一到越南，仍舊和在本國一樣，雖然每大城市已有法國人的各種歐式建設，但仍巍然保留着中國人慘淡經營的街道，和工商農礦各榮，安南各族人民的，衣食，住，行是和我們華僑分別不開的。越南人口中的民族分佈狀况，有如下表表。</p>
<p>（依一九三六年國勢調查）</p>
<p>種族　人口（比率千人）（％）</p>
<p>安南人　一六、六七九　一二·四</p>
<p>柬埔寨人　一、九二五　一二·七</p>
<p>泰人　一、三七五　六·〇</p>
<p>印度尼西亞人　一、〇一七　四·四</p>
<p>其他土人　六五九　二·九</p>
<p>土著民族　計二二、六五五　九八·四</p>
<p>中國人（米）　三二六　〇·二</p>
<p>法國人　三九　一·四</p>
<p>其他外國人　一〇——</p>
<p>合計　二三、〇三〇　一〇〇</p>
<p>（米）華僑之變遷性極大，而一九三七至一九四〇年問增加尤大，據估計在八十萬以上，但自滇越路斷絕後又激减，又華僑與土人混血人未計在內。</p>

<p>經濟界　經濟譯論</p>
<h3>關於物價問題的新見解</h3>
<p>最近日用品，生活必需品的價格，愈趨愈昂，大有一日千里之勢，這是一個不容片刻忽視的嚴重問題。如何抑平物價安定民生？如何打破囤積的弊害來解除消費者的痛苦？都是建設華中經濟途上的當務之急。</p>
<p>關於物價的對策，國府各機關，以及工部局，日本方面都在分頭進行，費盡苦心，設法解決。民間亦都認爲是嚴重問題，一致協力當局推動抑平物價的辦法·雖然這樣努力去幹，可是一切物價，還是扶搖直上，不可遏止，普通的手段，決不能抑止各物的漲風。非下最嚴厲措置沒有辦法可解決</p>
<p>物價　貴的根本原因，在於投機份子的收買囤積。同時生產的不振，各種生產物趨少，通貨的問題，祗是激成收買，囤積的原因之一，但是不能說是物價高漲的直接原因。華中各種商品的囤積存貸，不在少數，姑舉一例，試觀棉紗，棉布一項，華中的存貨，足敷四、五年之用，縱然生產不振，也不至影響民需，但是投機份子，在市上搜購，囤積不肯脫手，所以使人覺得有生產不振而影響價格的印象。時人每多物價政策之論議，但多忽視這種情形，祗知着重於一小問題，而不求澈底之辦法。增强生產，勵行官價，取締投機這一類主張，當然是重要問題，可是這辦法，都是治標而不是治本的，現在應該更進一步，考慮治本的辦法才是。</p>
<p>與其取締投機，毌寧設法使投機爲不可能，與其厲行官價，毌寧導物價自動降低至官定價格，這才是重要的事件。而原則上的取締投機，厲行官價方策，依然存在，祗要肯下工夫去硏究，不難發見其方針。例如發行商品風采，收買囤積商品，隨時把這些貨物在市塲上販賣，吸收剩餘購買力，或則把這些貨物運到內地，去換取原料，或者以此爲基礎，設立一個收買團體，負責來調整物資物價，這是個有効辦法現在物資和物價的問題，</p>
<p>相當嚴重。認淸這個問題，妥籌適當措置，我們深深地覺得是官民雙方所應負的重大責任。我們懇切的再向中日當局呼額，不要用治標的辦法，須要用治本的澈底政策。（雲鵬：譯自三月十一日大陸新報）</p>

<p>經濟評言</p>
<h3>銀行之私經濟與公經濟</h3>
<p>銀行爲公司組織。所謂公司者，依公司法第一條之規定，即以營利爲目的而設立之團體，是以銀行固無疑以營利爲目的。當其組織之初，設立之程序應如何，人事之安排應如何，內部之設備應如何，會計之制度應如何，皆爲主持人所最當考慮者。成立以後，存款如何招徠，放款如何經營，投資如何辦理，更爲主持人所當琿心竭慮。其目的無非如何可以謀利？如何可以對股東？以股東之血本而受託經營，欲不愧對於股東，則盈利自覺愈多愈好，此所謂銀行之私經濟。</p>
<p>然銀行爲半公用事業，自當以社會之福利爲前提，銀行本身盈利甚厚者，對於社會未必即爲有利。例如投機囤貨，一時之利或甚厚，而社會却已蒙害於無形。開發有益之產業，暫時見效或甚緩，而永久之利益則甚曹厚。社會能蒸蒸日上，銀行亦隨之發達，此所謂銀行之公經濟。</p>
<p>銀行專顧私經濟而不顧公經濟者，表面上雖或一時營業發達，而前途則未可預卜。若果全體銀行在國家法律拘束以內，旣能顧全私經濟，復能顧全公經濟，更隨公經濟之發展而獲正當之利益，則根本堅固，效用自宏，銀行本身之發達，自無待言。是以銀行應尊重社會之公益，服從國家之政策，所謂富國裕民，爲銀行之天職，豈可專以股東利益爲其單純之目標，片面之使命。</p>
<h3>中央儲備銀行新訂　放款整理限制辦法</h3>
<p>（南京十一日中央社電）中央儲備銀行，爲安定金融，抑平物價起見，對於各項放款，已定有整理及限制辦法。頃經中央社記者，向該行關係方面，採得該項辦法要點如下：（一）存放同業科目內餘額，自即日起，陸續收回，以二個月爲限，　後除呈經特准者多不得存放同業。（二）凡以糧食棉紗等，及其他日用品，或與製造日用品之有關各原料，爲抵押放款，或期抵押放款者，其放款一經到期，絕對不得轉展，嗣後對於該項物品之放款，不得承做。（三）嗣後以貨物向本行請求抵押放款者，應以各該同業公會會員，取得該公會之證明，並以當地主管機關頒有營業執照者爲限，凡非會員，當然非爲該業正當商人，自應予以拒絕，並由本行主管放款人員，對於各該請求抵押放款者，務於事前調查其資產信用，及其營業。上項抵押放款之最高限度，應於事前呈准總行核　，方准辦理。（四）凡請求抵押放款或轉抵押放款者，其抵押品之折算，應以公定價格爲標準，不得依照黑市市價折算。（五）抵押放款及轉抵押放款之期限，至多以三個足月爲滿期，期滿之後，以全部收回爲原則，如有必要，經事前陳准，得酌予展期，但以一次爲限。（六）抵押放款及轉抵押放款之利率，應就各該當地市面及市拆之實際情形，分別訂定。（七）抵押放款及轉抵押放款貨物之堆存，除有訂定契約及特殊情形者外，必須堆入本行倉庫，或特約倉庫，不得堆存於各該請求放款者之自營商店或貨倉。（八）抵押放款及轉抵押放款貨物之保險，應以中央信托公司承保爲限，不得由請求放款者隨便投資，並聞對各同業放款標準限度之計算方法，亦另訂有詳細辦法。</p>
<h3>本市經濟局　強化經濟機構</h3>
<p>上海特別市經濟局自本月一日成立後，即根據中央政治會議修正通過之經濟局組織暫行條例，設置一秘書室，第一二三四五五科辦公，現內部機構已組織健全，人事均已分配確定，積極推進一切工作，茲誌各情如次：</p>
<p>執掌事務</p>
<p>該局直隸於上海特別市政府並受實業部之指揮監督，掌理（一）關於工商業之登記及管理事狀况，核定共「抵押貨物種類及折扣」及「抵押放款之最高限度」，在限度內就其每年營運需要緩急，予以伸縮，勿得無限制予以濫放，並不得貸予非該會會員所經營之貨物放款項，（二）關於工商團體之組織登記，指導及監督事項，（三）關於工商業之保護獎勵及改良事項，（四）關於工商業調查事項，（五）關於物資之生產保存移動及配給事項，（六）關於物價之調整及管理事項，（七）其他與工商管理有關事項。</p>

<h3>銀錢業　放款新辦法公佈　—本市經濟界羣疑盡釋—</h3>
<p>自經財政當局頒布放款限制辦法，並對本市銀行界頒發此項訓令以來，社會一般人士，對於此一問題，頗多玄測。流言所播，甚且以爲限制提存，影響人心，殊非淺鮮。實則此項流言，絕無根據。茲經本報探悉，前日上海市銀行業公會業經議決通過銀錢放款新辦法。爰亟以共最確定之內容披露如左，藉釋社會人士之疑。按銀錢業放款新辦法，分爲新放款與舊放款兩項，而新放款項下，列爲四個條款，一爲借款人，二爲質押物，三爲放款期限，四爲信用放款。一切限制，旣爲嚴格，復稱合理。由於此一新辦法之產生，無論放款者與借款者，雖處於放款限制之環境中，仍不致感受因噎廢食之痛苦，而市間無稽謠詠，亦得從此消弭矣。　編者</p>

<p>讀者意見</p>
<h3>信託公司兼營放款問題</h3>
<p>— 芑</p>
<p>昨日各報刋載當局取締信託公司兼營放款消息有云。。「當局爲抑平物價，對於各銀行錢莊之放款，曾三令五申，着其對於不事生產之放款，概行收回，藉以緊縮市面籌碼，使投機者無法調度頭寸，不再爲害市面。商業社記者頃探悉，當局鑒於本埠之大信託公司數家，亦有銀行部份之設立，對各業商人，從事放款業務。此種營業，顯係越出信託公司業務之常軌，實有取締之必要。故除嚴令該公司等切實遵照政府所頒佈之「金融機關管理法規』營業外，並限各公司自即日起，自動撤銷其銀行部門業務，並儘速收回已放出之貸款云。』</p>
<p>當局取締不正當之放款，抑平物價，其苦心殊深欽佩。惟此事關係信託公司之是否能兼營放款業務問題，在實際上法律上頗有研究價値，請爲商討之。</p>
<p>先就信託公司與銀行之關係而言，目下銀行兼營信託，而設信託部，信託公司兼營銀行而設銀行部，蓋前者爲銀行法之所許，後者爲信託公司暫行條例所明定。財政部頒給信託公司之執照，亦爲銀行營業執照。故實際上銀行與信託公司，並無多大區別。良以我國信託事業，正在幼稚，兩者兼營，相互挹注，正所以扶植信託事業之發展。至於業務上之便利，亦爲理由之一。日本本將銀行與信託分營，據最近支那情報訊，去年十一月二十四日日本政府閣議，曾通過「普通銀行兼營業務法案」，應許普通銀行得兼營儲蓄銀行及信託公司之業務，如是則日本之制度，亦變分營爲兼營。蓋銀行與信託公司實際上業務之關係，實太密切，兼營之使，不言而喻。此就實際情形言，信託公司之兼營存放業務，爲各國已著之事實，誠有事實上之需要。</p>
<p>事實當然不能越出法律，上節曾言二者兼營，爲銀行及信託公司兩種法規之所許。查我國新頒信託公司暫行條例，第十二條規定：『信託公司經財政部之核准，得兼營左列附屬業務：（一）收受存款，（二）辦理放款，（三）票據貼現，（四）滙兌或押匯，（五）買賣有價證券及不動產，（六）倉庫業。是明明皆銀行業務也。而辦理放款，尤爲明文規定。現在之信託公司，其設立經財實兩部之登記給照，其組織及業務章程，皆經財實兩部之核准，其營業報吿，按期呈送金融主管機關查核，且同受中央儲備銀行之領導。其營業之有無法律根據，是否越出範圍，皆爲當局所明悉，蓋與銀行並無二致也。</p>
<p>由上而言，信託公司之兼營存放等銀行業務，在法律上旣有根據，自不得視爲違法之業務。顧我人所不能不目加檢討者，信託公司放款之中，有無被投機份子利用之處，但此項問題，不獨信託公司爲然。最近當局對於銀行放款嚴定原則，禁止投機，信託公司自當絕對共同遵守，此信託公司本身所應檢討者一。</p>
<p>又年來新設之價託公司，不下三四十家，其中是否皆爲正式註册之信託公司。若有非正式註冊，居信託公司之名，而經營他種業務或亦有兼營放款者，自爲法律所不許。此種情形，或亦　所難免。此信託公司應力求同業間之整飾，所應檢討者二。</p>
<p>此次報章所載取締信託公司兼營放款之訊，或許係指上述二項情形而言，亦未可知，即（一）信託公司如有不遵當局頒布各項法規命令所做之放款，應加取締。（二）如有未正式註冊之信託公司，絕對不准經營銀業。就第一項言，此間正式之數大信託公司，旣隨時受政府之監督，當不致有違法情事。但當局之注意及此，無非爲謀社會之福利，且其所注意者，對於整個銀錢業之放款，固不僅信託公司爲然。就第二項言，未正式註册之公司，而用信託公司之名，本妨碍整個信託業之信譽。其加以取締，當然爲信託業及全體金融業所歡迎。</p>
<p>所以當局擬加取締之訊果爲確實者，或許限於上述二種情形。亦未可知。總之，此次問題對於信託公司之業務，以及銀行之兼營信託者，均有重大之關係，故爲檢討於斯，以供各界之參考。</p>
<h3>今日保險業之透視</h3>
<p>— 陸申豹</p>
<p>近二年來，保險事業，一日千里，新設公司之多，尤如雨後春笋，乃社會人士，時有談及，書報記載，諭述尤多，然大都爲經濟學者根據學理或統計而集述之文字，至於從業人員，依據實際情況，而加以評述者，頗不多見，作者不　，謹就年來觀感所及，依最近保險業之發展，及業務改進，投資　向，賠款情形各點，草率成篇，雖管窺之見，然皆事實之序述。</p>
<p>保險業突趨發展之因果</p>
<p>保險業近年來突趨發展之遠因有三，一爲保險從業人員自身之分化，二爲洋商保險業之沒落，及其從業員之尋覓出路，三爲盲目投機及投資之妄動。</p>
<p>保險從業人員及領袖之分化，實爲釀造此種畸形發展之主因，按華商保險公司，昔以太平中國等爲個中翹楚，其職昌不下一千餘人，越年旣久，主其事者，每有事務職位分配難週之苦，於是擁有實力者，或有遠見而知洋商公司之必趨沒落者，競謀爭雄之計，大東創於先，大南繼其後，此後由太平中國原子而萌發之新公司尤多，論者以爲當時此等公司之創設，究尚未離保險之正軌也。</p>
<p>迨夫洋商保險公司沒落之時，其大部華籍人員，失所依憑，此等人員，以前已因洋商之勢力，在保險業造成相當之地位，而其經營方法，又非一部份華商公司所贊同，名低則不就，位高則不容，於是在不願低首而又無人請敎之局面下，新公司之組織，乃萌啟其端，同時一部份盲目投資投機家助其聲威，以爲保險公司，儘可不需資本，即有資本，亦可另作用途：如五百萬元資本，儘可以二百萬元兼辦銀行，其餘更可兼辦布廠姻號股票號等業數十家，再以銀行吸收存款，互爲流注，彼此烘托，前途發展，未可限量，於是互爲誘導，保險從業人員，更廣爲游說，互爲利用，此後新公司之產生，幾乎每日一家，開自來未有之盛况。</p>
<p>公司旣多，業務遂濫，經副襄理之多，如過江之鯽，祗知多拉生意，濫放折扣，而保戶亦因董事或股東關係，多少投保，交情而已，彼此根本不知保險爲何物，經紀人處保戶之險於不顧，視公司之虧蝕於不顧，生意愈多，面子愈好，佣金愈多，卑詞厚禮，無所不至，視保戶爲經紀人之財產，任其由甲公司帶至乙公司，再轉保丙公司，保戶身家所寄托之保險，乃爲人利用至此，言之慨然。識者憂之。</p>
<p>最近業務之改進</p>
<p>在此保險業高潮澎湃之秋，聯合圖存，乃爲自然之趨勢。公司之承保數目，超過其自留限額者，必須分予他公司承保，此乃危險分擔自然之例。倘有任何公司，因分保困難，而將自保限額，不加限制者，此於公司本身，及保戶之危險至鉅，且爲整個華商同業之信譽，及社會安寗之大礙。十餘年前之某華商保險公司，因亂訂保價，不能分保，故掃數爲自保，結果因杭州大火，造成洋商公司空前之機會，故分保實爲公司切身之要圖。華商公司爲顧念切身利害起見，除原有華商聯合分保外，最近乃有太平分保集團，乃大上海分保集團之組織，各擁有大小公司二十餘家，此等集團之創立，可使保險業務趨於水準，實亦爲保險業領袖設計之成功，其補救於當前溷亂之局者，蓋非淺鮮。</p>
<p>保險價格之規定，當時原未依據任何出險統計而訂立，（在事實亦不可能），祗依當時洋商公會之規定而已，共後，由華商公會參酌改訂，而折扣一項，亦以當時分保與洋商公司之折扣爲最低限度，是故倘有一保險公司，而不辦理分保者，則儘可依照一公司自行對於所保房屋估計之危險比例程度而增减之。然旣有分保，自不得不依照分保之最低折扣爲最低限度，故公司必須分保，因分保而必須維持保價及折扣。分保集團（聯合數家公司互爲分保者）即等於廠商，保險公司等批發門市，而經紀人等於零售商，零售價不能低於批發，而批發價不能低於廠盤。故今日保戶對於保價折扣之參差，當知其原因所在。</p>
<p>然處此情形之下，各公司爲競爭營業，　不得不貶價或竟照分保折扣出單者，（照此辦法開支毫無着落）是亦商業推廣之末策，或爲公司薪給人員維持面子地位之茍全政策。如此，則公司開支，勢不得不仰賴其他收益，一爲加入分保集團盈餘之挹注，一爲自保限額項下之收入，及資金運用之所得。然集團盈餘依整個集團之資本及生意爲分配，所得極微，而自保限額，決不能過巨，故所得不多，於是小得小全賴資金之運用。舉上所述，保險公司倚賴保費收入以資挹注實難，因保費收入除去分保保費以外，尙須提出自保項下之出險凖備金若干成，故每月收入保費十萬元以下之小公司，　際上決不能維持開支。</p>
<p>投資之考慮</p>
<p>公司對於保費盈餘之希望旣少，乃不得不依賴資金之運用。查保險業對於整個社會安全發生密切關係，故其資金之運用，國家原有一定之限制及監察，倘任其從事不芷當之投機或投資，在投資者旣失其投資之本性，且一且出險，實有不足應付賠償之危險。持者爲保障資產計，不得不有所計畫，亦事實環境所造成，原無容諱，然在法理上言之，則保險公司資金之運用，固當有一定之限制。</p>
<p>賠款漫談</p>
<p>保險所以保障危險。萬一出險，則今日保險公司之賠款問題，亦爲我人關心保險業現狀者所應提出討論者。</p>
<p>按以前洋商公司最盛時代，公司賠款，必須經過洋商公證行之估計。當時駐華公司，均爲代理性質，其外國總公司，祗　公證行之報吿，故公證行權威極大，經紀人皆　奉唯恐不至。昔日因出險而曾與公證行接　之保戶，類能道之。華商公司興起以來，爲避免公司與保戶直接衝突起見，亦不免假手於公證行者。此等國人經營之公證行，鑒於以往洋商公證人之爲人指摘，故大都能勉循正軌，然賠償之權，實際仍操諸公司之手，故影響所及，不應賠而賠者有之，濫加而爲號召者有之，置公司虧蝕及同業規章於小顧，一味討好於經紀人及保戶，博數行登報鳴謝廣吿而巳。</p>
<p>火險賠款非如賭博。然推算方法，固至複雜，要皆合於情法之間。是故處理賠款之公證人員，除應具廉明公正之人格外，必須精硏法理，通達人情，熟其當地市况，然後辨其眞僞，詳爲估計。其報告書尤不能僅以估計數字爲了事，必須詳予報吿，逐點量情依法，加以論斷，務使保戶見之，心悅誠服，此與公證信譽及公司地位相關至鉅。今日從事公證人員，是否符合上述條件，姑不具論，然公司竟有視賠款爲廣吿術者，公證行亦紛紛設立。（目前因未施行嚴格考試登記，故亦無從辨別其資格，）爲營業計自不得不唯公司之命是從。往往有先由公證行以毫無理論之估計數字，先酌一數目，然後由三方面酌加理賠者，更有先由公司在交情上與保戶酌一數目，然後由公證行塡具報吿者。總之以賠得多賠得快爲一部份當局所採用。長此以往，競爭愈烈，每况愈下，狡者必將施其詐，而忠厚者將啟其疑，殊非保險業前途之福。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>每一業務之推展，端賴同業之團結。保險旣爲一種社會事業，除必須國家之法令限制嚴予執行外，公會力量，旣有未逮，勢唯賴分保權威運用共分保之威力，爲整個之調整。關於保率折扣反賠款，尤須有整個之步伐，則有益於社會福利，同業信譽，當非淺鮮。作者鑒於目前確爲華商保險業永久奠定基礎千載一時之機會，時乎不再，而在潮勃起，用述大概，以爲業外人士視保險爲掘金運動　羣起附和者，作一參考。並爲因保障危險而保險之保戶，作一南針，更爲投資於保險事業之股東作一審察。</p>

<p>國父逝世紀念　造林運動特輯</p>
<h3>實業部一年來　造林事業之實施</h3>
<p>— 梅思平</p>
<p>在去年參加國父逝世紀念植樹典禮的時候，曾舉出幾個造林事業的實際問題來喚起國人的注意，現在又是一年了，本屆的舉行植樹典禮，不免使我想到去年所提出的幾個實際問題來，那幾個問題呢？就是提倡民有林問題，森林保護問題，以及林墾兼施問題。這些問題，如果不能解決，那麽一年一度的植樹典禮，仍恐是徒具形式，無補實際。須知植樹典禮，原是造林運動的紀念儀式，大部分的實際工作，還要由職掌林業的機關切實去做的。所以要得這些問題的解決，不僅是植樹期間一時的注意，確要時常經久的努力。</p>
<p>本人職掌實業，這林業建設當然是職分以內的重要事業。我們要知道建設不只是理論的探討，却重在工作的實施。自然從去年注意到這幾個實際問題以後，就設法逐步施行，只以時間短促，尙看不出多大成效。這當然還需要繼續不斷的努力，現在利用造林運動的機會，把一年以來有關這幾個問題的重要工作，作一個簡單的報告。還希望全國各林業機關以及人民，大家起來，切實注意，共同努力。</p>
<p>（一）提倡民有林問題民有林的提倡，端賴供給苗木，所以第一步就籌設育苗塲。於三十一年十月間先後成立育苗塲七處，並擬具採種育苗計劃大綱，提呈院會通過積極施行。同時，各林塲所育苗木，計有一百八十萬株，除供給自己造林以外，還可以撥發四十萬株，無償供給人民的目動造林。因此，植樹適期來臨，凡人民請求配發苗木的，都儘量配發。粽計截至現在止，已經配發苗木，計有南京市政府轉發燕子磯各鄕保人民黑松側柏等樹苗五萬七千株；浙東行政公署轉發側柏二千株；安徽嘉山縣政府轉發側柏洋槐楓楊等二萬株；六台縣政府轉發白楊黑松側柏麻櫟等三千五百株；淳化林墾示範塲及常熟農業改進區轉發馬尾松側柏楓楊等一萬株，；其他各機關如中央將校訓練團，警衛第二師，中央大學農學院，中國靑年工讀團，及佛敎慈幼院，共配發黑松側柏等五萬株；並由林墾署分派技術人員負責指導，協助栽植。又本京北極閣風景林春季補植，也由本部供給大量苗木，一面派員協同文物保管委員會設計栽種。至於本部培育大量苗木，預計民國三十三年度各育苗塲可以出山者，約二千七百萬株，可供給推廣民衆造林七萬畝。一屆民國三十四年時期，逐年靑成出山苗木四千萬株，可供民衆造林十萬畝之用。數字雖然很小，但希望繼續不斷的努力下去，能使民營林塲和國營林塲同時並進，我想十年以內，必可收到顯著的成效。</p>
<p>（二）森林保護問題造林以後的唯一要圖，就是保護問題。過去護林的責任，多由森林警察担負，但是與民衆未能發生直接關係，遂致毫無成效。現在要使民衆本身參加保護工作，才能有澈底的功效。所以我們擬定森林保護條例的時候，就利用護林團的組織，來切實保護森林，此項條例，已經在去年八月間，由國民政府公布施行。說起護林團的辦法，就是先把森林四週，劃定護林地帶，在護林地帶以內的居民。按照保甲制度，編組護林團，凡十歲以上的男女都可編爲護林團員，凡屬團員均有應盡的義務，同時也享受應享的權利。義務是：（二）禁阻林木的砍伐，果實的攀折；（二）森林火災的防救；（三）病虫害的防除；（四）樵採剪枝狩獵　牧的監視及禁阻；（五）造林的協助，權利是依照公吿的方法時期及地段，享受樵採剪枝狩獵放牧及優先承墾森林以內宜墾的荒地，這種護林團組織，乃是使森林與附近居民，發生直接關係，督促民衆自己實行保護森林，聞接也可以促進民衆造林的興趣，本部所　原有森林之第一·第九·第十一·第十二各林墾示範塲，都已經先後組織成立，積極督促施行。將來仍須力求普遍，務使全國森林地帶，都有護林團的組織。</p>
<p>（三）林墾兼施問題，造林與墾荒，具有密切關係，同時墾荒和造林的工作期間，也有先後的不同。在人力利用上，可以互相調劑，並目造林爲長期事業，墾殖則年有收穫，經濟方面，亦可藉此挹注。所以去年本部首先成立林墾署，並次第將過去各林塲及墾殖示範塲，分別裁併，改設林墾示範塲十二處，使林墾兩項示範事宜，歸併在一塲內辦理，已於去年十一月一日組織成立。一面育田造林，一面墾荒增產，利用宜林宜墾的荒山荒地，經營種植，兼以示範。辦理以來，粗具規模，今後更當繼續督促進行，俾收較大的成果。</p>
<p>綜上所述，一年以來，三個實際問題，已辦有頭緒，但未能說到盡善盡美地步。今後益當繼續努力，以過去一年的工作爲基礎，而逐漸擴充。同時，更希望由中央而擴展到地方，使造林事業，風行全國，這不但是箇人的責任，還有賴於關心造林的諸君，羣策眾力，共襄厥成。</p>
<h3>造林運動　民衆應有的認識</h3>
<p>— 袁愈佺</p>
<p>我們要知道造林是一般民衆的建設事業，決不是那一界民衆的責任。政府舉行造林運動，旨在促使民衆澈底明瞭造林的利益，大家努力造林。造林這件事，能把無用的荒山，變爲有用；把無業的人民，給以工作，使變爲有業之人，這是生產建設的大事業。生產增加，就可把衰落的民衆拯救起來，貧弱的國家振興起來，其關係這樣重大，所以，全國民衆，應當一致起來，擴大道民生建設的造林運動。</p>
<p>我們又要知道造林運動，不但是爲將來國家人民謀福利，實在是目前的救國救民的辦法。這種運動，不但救人，確是自救。有益於國計民生甚大。但是因爲出自政府的提倡，一般民衆往往誤認是政府的事情，不但不去切實推行，即於公家已栽的樹木，也不發生愛護的觀念，甚至加以毀傷，以致造林多年，成効甚少。到了現在。濯濯童山，仍然隨地可見。國計旣然無由充裕，民生也就因而日　。是以國家民挨，貧弱如故。要知道人民摧殘樹木直接雖是損害公物，間接就是促進民埃和國家的危亡，無異戕害自己的生機。我們現在旣無時不高呼謀取國家和民族的生存，那末就應該一致起來，實行擴大這種造林運動，以增加生產建設，加强國家和民族的力量，俾達生存的目的。我們更要知道造林運動，不但對於一般民衆有利，且能應付農工商各界民衆的需要，而給予特別利益。譬如農民從事造林，便可把不宜耕種的土地，得到適當的利用，使一家大小有工可作。生產結果，小足以供給自己一家的薪炭林木的需要：大還可獲得永久的收入，以救濟凶早荒災。工人從事造林，可以增進林木生產，供給工業所需原料，本身旣沒有失業的危險，家人更得森林副產收入。商人從事造林，可把最小的費用，造成巨値的森林，作爲保險儲蓄，一且遭遇經濟恐慌，則以森林資本的安全儲蓄，仍得維持營業於不敗。其他像士兵能從事造林，便可增進自身職業的技能，養成從事生產工作的興趣，不致在退伍後失去生活的憑藉。學生以及一般智識分子從事造林，除得引起勞動興趣，養成勤勉習慣外，更以愛護自己植樹的緣故，不知不覺地爲森林的自然美所醇化，因而增進活潑的精神，養成高尙的德性。所以，各界民衆如欲謀求自身特別的利益，和永久的幸福，便該一致起來，實行擴大這種利益最大，効果最宏的造林運動。</p>
<h3>發展中國林業應取的方針</h3>
<p>— 邵仲香</p>
<p>今天是國父逝世十八週紀念日，同時也是本年造林運動的開始期，國民政府把造林運動定在國父逝世紀念日舉行，他的意義非常深遠，因爲這運動目的，是在提倡造林，實現國父實業計劃，建造全國大規模森林，來預防水旱，救濟農民，發展工商業的。含義旣然這樣重大，所以應該政府和人民交相策勵，務必要以實事求是的主旨，力求林業建設的成功。</p>
<p>講到發展中國林業，應從下列的幾點方針進行：</p>
<p>（一）勵行林業保護：保護森林，比較營造森林難，這說法已經現代一般林業家所公認了，所以保護森林，比較營造森林需要，尤其迫切，荒廢的山野，雖沒有人工栽樹，常常因爲保護周到，可以借大然力量，育成優美的森林，那經人工正式的造林，也可以因爲保護不周到漸漸變爲童禿山野，這種事實，祇要我們留心考察，到處可見，所以爲求全國林業迅速的發展，自今以後，最切要的工作，就是注意在森林，保護問題，凡是山野，林地，無論是天然生長的，或是入工種植的，那已經成林的樹木，都應該嚴加保護，使牠能長成良材，至於公　業塲所的考成，不要在他種植樹苗的數目多少，而要特別注意牠保護成材林木的成績。</p>
<p>（二）實行以林造林：無論那種建設事業的實施必須要充分的經費，才可以盡量發展。林業也是建設事業的一種，自然不能逃出這種公例。但是以我國現在經濟的力量來講，要想求林業發展上不受經濟的束縛，除非實行以林造林的政策不爲功</p>
<p>我國疆土廣大，氣候土質，得天獨厚，凡是國內崇山峻嶺，人烟稀少的地方，天然森林的存在，仍屬很多，據專家的調查，北部如河北，河南等省。中部如浙江，安徽，江西，湖北等省。南部如廣東，廣西，福建等省。森林面積，超過七萬萬畝，比較林業最發達的德國，全國森林的面積，已在三倍以上，這種大塊森林，現在都因交通閉塞，還沒有利用，坐使利棄於地，如果能應用科學方法，培養牠，保護牠，開發牠，利用牠，以收地盡其利，物盡其用的效果，那　國家經濟自然　　，以之建設他部森林，或發展他項林業，自然可以免除經費上的困難。</p>
<p>（三）普及林業知識：一個國家林業的興衰，當看他林業知識的普及與吾而定，因爲林業建設，必須有大多數人民，對於林業有相當的認識，因認識才能發生興趣，有了興趣才蓄用力在森林的保護和經營上。　國父對於物質建牧的初步，特注重心理的建設，用意就是如此，我國林業，荒廢已久，人民對於林業知識，很覺得幼稚，譬如育苗這件事，許多農人，就不知道，所以自今以後，我們應該遵照政府規定造林運動的宗旨，在宣傳林粱知識上，多加努力，以求普及。</p>
<p>（四）扶助民林的發展：「講到種植全國森林的問題，還是要靠國家來經營，才容易成功」，這是國父曾經昭示我們的，我們自然要敬謹遵行。不過在現代中國，如果要把全國合於造林的山荒，無論大片小塊，統通由國家收來，單獨由政府力量去建造森林，未免難做得週全，况也不能於短期內做到，所以除了有關公安國防，以及其他大片山荒，或特種地域，劃分爲國營林區域外，其在幅地，小片細塊的山塲，還要在相當範圍內努力去扶助民有林業的發展，因爲國家經營林業的目的，是在替人民謀求福利，如果人民能在相當條件下，去經營與自身有利，並且與國家整個有益的林業，政府自然要扶持他協助他進行。</p>
<p>前面所講的，不過就發展中國林業，略舉應取的方針。至於怎樣規劃進行，應當隨時隨地，參酌情形，確定方案始可。</p>
<p>更進一步夾講，林業係一種含有繼續性的生產事業，要想求全國林業建設的成功，尤須全國民衆有不斷的努力。希望全國林業界的人們，能永遠脚踏實地去工作，更希望非林業界的人們，能永遠去極力予以實際的協助庶　乎國父建造全國大規模森林的政策，得在最短時期內實現，這就是今日舉行造林運動的最大目的。</p>
<h3>造林的利益</h3>
<p>— 實業部林墾署</p>
<p>談到「造林」這件事，在我國都市裏人們，任爲是政府裏一項事業，不知道重視，在鄕村裏人們，更是茫然，祇知道栽樹是一件隨便沒有什麼關係的事，可以說十個人竟有八個人，對造林這件事不注意，更不知道與國家社會人民有極密切的關係，這都是因爲不能澈底明瞭造林利益的原故，現在藉首都造林運動的機會，把造林直接和間接利益來介紹大家。</p>
<p>（一）直接的利益：</p>
<p>（一）生產木材木材是森林主要的大宗產物，也就是我們天天所必要的東西，試想我們起居的房屋床榻，交通的橋樑舟車，耕地所用農具的村料，家庭中紡織的器具和一切的用具，那一件不是木材做成的，那一種可以缺少木材，就是鑛業工業以及別的各種事業，所用器具，雖然不一定專是木料，可是木料的確是居重要部份。</p>
<p>（二）供給副產森林除了出產材木以外，還有附帶的生產，如樹脂·桐油·松油·樟腦·漆料。軟木等，有時專以生產這類品爲主而來造林的，如福建的漆林，樟林，浙江的油桐林等，可見這類副產品在社會上是很需要的</p>
<p>（三）發展資本森林資本，是包括生長的樹木和生長樹木的土地來講的，世界上凡是農作物不能生長的土地，都可以供給樹木的生長，假使儘量利用來種樹，那末林地所佔的面積，所投的資本，所用的人工，將非常廣大，此等投資，雖不能立時收回，但是一種長久的資產。</p>
<p>（四）容納勞工我國林地比任何國家來得廣大，那麽造林，砍伐，運輸，鋸板，配料等作，當然容納極多的勞力。此外附帶的事業，如木材運輸機關，副產製造機關等，其中所需要的勞力，尤其比造林砍伐等事爲大。德國是世界上林業最發達的國家，他的民衆，依賴林　爲生活的，竟佔全國人口百分之十二。我國如果林業發達，不愁有勞工過剩之事。</p>
<p>（五）改良土質林木需要施肥比較的少，磽瘠的土地也能生長樹木，如緬甸合歡金合歡等荳料植物，不但不消耗土中養分，而且能吸收空中的氮氣，使成爲土中的重要肥料。所以磽瘠的土地造林，兼有改良土壤的功效，就是其他不能吸收氮氣作肥料的苗木，凋落之後枝葉遺留在地面上，一經腐化，就成爲肥料，使土中有機質增加，土質可由磽瘠變成沃壤。我國荒地各省都有，尤其是西北邊疆諸省，荒區比較格外多，現在政府極力倡導造林，開墾荒地，如果能按照各地的氣候，土質，從事造林，先求改良土質，等到土質改良以後，再來栽植農作物，未始不是生產之道。</p>
<p>（二）間接的利益：</p>
<p>（一）增加雨量森林有降仳溫度蒸發濕氣的作用，所以有森林的地方，比較沒有森林的地方來得濕澗，並且帶濕的空氣通過林　時候，遇着林地裏流出的比較低濕的空氣，立刻就可以使濕氣凝結成雨，降到地面來，所以有森林的地方，雨量常常比較沒有森林地方爲多。</p>
<p>（二）防止天災森林可以防止風災，乃是利用森林的强大樹幹，廣闊樹冠，來抵禦在風，减少災害機械作用：所以各國在近海或有烟害附近的地方，都用森林做天然的屛障，有森林的地方，又可以防止地表溫度的劇變，和阻碍氣流的迅速上騰，有　兩種的力量，可以縮小降雹的區域和减少雹害。</p>
<p>（三）消弭水旱森林可以减少水旱災荒，乃是因爲森林有涵養水源的作用，第一：森林的樹冠可以防止土地水分的乾燥和蒸發，第二：森林的落葉，蘚苔。蟠根等，可以防止水的流出，據實騐的結果，林地的蒸發量，比較裸地只有一半。至於森林防水的流出，各國森林家有詳細的調查，竟可達到百分之七十有六，使這水份可以緩緩的流下來，如此不致冲洗泥沙淤塞河床，造成水患。</p>
<p>（四）裨益衛生山林間的人，平均壽命都比較城市的人來得長，這是我們所公認的事實。他的原因雖然很多，主要的還是因爲空氣中含有我們生活所必要的養氣，道是因爲林木生理上的呼吸作用，能够把空氣中對人不良成分的炭酸氣消納，放出最良好的養氣，來供我們的需要，所以越近森林的地方，養氣越多，距森林越遠的地方，養氣較少。又因爲森林區的空氣，常常保持消潔，病原菌不容易繁殖，也不容易傳播，還有飲水每每是傳染疾病的重大媒介，山林間的泉水，比較沒有林區同城市甲的飲水，淸潔不知要差多少。所以森林區域內空氣中的養氣旣多，而且淸潔，泉水又乾凈，有益於衛生，是無疑的事。</p>
<p>（五）點綴風景風景是我們人類不能忘情的。不過風景要是沒有森林來點綴他，決不能成立。因爲森林對於增加風趣以外，他鬱鬱葱葱的美景，雄壯偉大的姿態，處處地方可以使人民精神煥發，志氣高尙。所以東西各國，不論城市和鄕間，几是道路，住宅旁邊，沒有不種植林木來增加風姿。並有專門種植森林來供給人民遊息的，用意是非常的深遠。</p>

<h3>Planting Trees and Planting People</h3>
<p>Every year on Arbor Day, all national agencies and organizations participate in tree-planting activities. From the perspective of the significance of planting trees, it is a proactive and constructive movement, definitely not a trivial pursuit for a few individuals or a gesture to adorn a festive occasion. Therefore, it should be elevated into a mass movement, expanding from tree planting to forest protection and afforestation. We should not only protect the woodlands surrounding the graves of our ancestors but also safeguard the forests and trees everywhere, and plant new forests on a large scale; this is of great significance in increasing national wealth and promoting agriculture and water conservancy. However, tree planting inevitably leads us to think about the more serious issue of planting people, and the issue of forest protection and afforestation leads us to think about protecting and cultivating talent.</p>
<p>Looking at Chinese history, the brilliance of each generation's academic culture is always due to the nation's and society's love and cultivation of talent. The development of Chinese academics reached its peak in the Song and Ming dynasties. Examining the likes of the Cheng brothers and Zhu Xi in the Song Dynasty, and Wang Yangming in the Ming Dynasty, their ability to create a national spirit of scholarship was due to the establishment of the Imperial College by the state. Locally, schools were widely established, providing stipends for teachers and students to cultivate talent. The academies of the Song and Ming dynasties were particularly the centers for cultivating scholarship. During the Song Dynasty, academies such as Bailu and Yuelu were founded by the government, while others were founded by enthusiastic members of society. During the Ming Dynasty, Mr. Wang Yangming personally founded many academies, which flourished as institutions of higher learning. Students entering the academies were not only provided with clothing, food, and stipends but also had their families provided with rice and salaries by the government. However, in contrast, what kind of treatment do contemporary intellectuals receive? Today, those who aspire to study academics not only have their own livelihood problems to solve but also have families of five or six, or even seven or eight, to support. Moreover, studying today is not like in the past when one only needed to focus on one classic or one skill, with three or five boxes of books, to bury oneself under the window and become famous in ten years. Today, one must understand the general trends of the world and pursue specialized knowledge in depth; the difference in difficulty is simply incomparable. Due to the high cost of schooling today and the lack of universal access to education, most young people suffer from the hardship of being unable to attend school. Those who rely on ancestral legacy and the assistance of relatives and friends, even if they do not become typical Anglo-American figures due to Anglo-American teaching methods, will inevitably be worn down by small and large exams, making them feel lost and helpless, only able to sigh at the vastness of academic research. Before the war, there were several research institutes that encouraged research and achieved considerable results. However, since the incident, even if they still exist, due to soaring prices, researchers cannot maintain their livelihoods. Although they have great ambitions for academic research, they cannot help but be forced by life to chase after worldly gains. Looking around, how many places today can be called places for cultivating talent? What are the results? If, on the one hand, trees are planted to provide shade, while on the other hand, there is a sense of a lack of talent, how can this be fortunate for the nation and the people?</p>
<p>Therefore, today, we once again loudly appeal, hoping that the government will pay attention to the great plan of planting people. First, it is to cherish existing talents and cultural relics, and not to easily waste talent. Even those with incorrect thinking or past words and deeds that are not entirely pure, as long as they are promising talents, should be allowed to devote their efforts to academic research and be protected, and not allowed to wither and be abandoned. Secondly, we further hope that the government will expand the movement to cultivate talent. Although the government's financial resources are limited today, it must focus on the education and culture sectors, because the ultimate determining factor in all policies is only the word "talent." Therefore, increasing funding for various education and culture institutions, raising salaries for education and culture personnel, and establishing preferential treatment measures for students at all levels are all urgent matters that cannot be delayed. In addition, influential figures in society should also think about the long-term plans for the nation and actively donate funds to assist education and culture undertakings, pooling their efforts to cultivate talent. We dare to assert that as long as the government loves and nurtures talent and advocates cultivating people first, influential figures in society will surely be able to shoulder heavy responsibilities later. There is no shortage of far-sighted people in both the government and the public. We hope they will not ignore this fundamental task of the great era as stale conventional wisdom.</p>

<h3>The Fourth Term President and American Ambitions</h3>
<p>According to foreign news reports, the executives of the Democratic National Committee in the United States have decided to recommend Roosevelt as a candidate in the next presidential election battle, on the condition that the war continues until 1944. Roosevelt has not expressed any opinion on this. Of course, he will remain silent until the last moment and wait for public opinion to judge. This is the tactic he used when he was elected for the third time in 1940. Especially this time, in order to alleviate the atmosphere of responsibility for the impeachment failure, this tactic is even more necessary.</p>
<p>Whether Roosevelt can be elected for a fourth term or whether power will be transferred to the opposition Republican Party will depend on the war situation this year, and it is impossible to predict today. However, Republican leaders have also voiced even more aggressive words than the Democrats, so there is no essential difference between the leadership of the two parties, which is noteworthy. At least under the current circumstances, no matter where the power ends up, the US guiding policy will not undergo fundamental changes. Even if there are changes, they would only suggest a strategic retreat.</p>
<p>Navy Secretary Knox had long ago argued that the United States' "two-ocean fleet" was not enough and that it must prepare a "seven-ocean fleet" capable of dominating the world's seven oceans. This ambition to dominate the world is not a ridiculous fantasy of their kind. Although he holds a position in the Democratic cabinet, he was originally a pure Republican. This Republican Party was in power during the heyday of ruthless dollar diplomacy. We should remember the process after Stimson's tough policy failed during the Manchurian Incident, temporarily retreating strategically from East Asian policy.</p>
<p>However, in the seemingly strong but inwardly weak appearance of the United States, we can also see the anxiety of the current leadership. If the war drags on like this, it will be impossible to maintain popular support until the 1944 election. The progression of this year's war and the difficulties of life next winter will become the watershed for whether the American public will erupt their dissatisfaction with their leaders in the election. This year is the year of decisive battle. We should clearly recognize the ambitions of the leaders of the two major American parties, be strictly vigilant, and never fall into wishful thinking.

<p>Statement by Japanese Authorities</p>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The General Headquarters of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China, the Headquarters of the China Area Fleet, and the Japanese Embassy in China jointly issued the following statement on March 11 regarding the control of materials in our country by the Japanese authorities: "After the National Government announced its declaration of war against Britain and the United States at the beginning of this year, China's wartime posture in terms of politics and economics has gradually been established due to the strengthening of the National Government. The restrictions on the movement of materials previously implemented by Japan were taken in response to this special situation. When China adapts to wartime needs and its strong commercial organization for collecting and distributing important materials is completed, Japan will abolish the current restrictions on the movement of materials. Fortunately, in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, influential figures in Shanghai's financial circles are preparing to establish the National Commercial Control Association to implement the collection, distribution, and control of important materials. This is indeed an appropriate measure. It is hoped that it can achieve its intended goals based on self-sufficient control, so as to stabilize people's livelihoods, revive the economy, and ensure the necessary materials for the progress of the war. We sincerely hope that the people of both China and Japan will understand this spirit and provide full assistance. It will take some time to prepare the various control commercial organizations under the National Commercial Control Association. After consultation with the National Government, the temporary regulations for the control of materials transfer in the Japanese-occupied areas in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River will be eased in accordance with the following guidelines as a temporary measure and will be implemented from March 16: (1) Restrictions on movement near Shanghai will be temporarily maintained until the collection and distribution agencies are prepared. However, the restricted materials will be limited to those that are necessary and unavoidable. On the outbound side, cement, salt, cooking oil, wool, woolen fabrics and their products, rayon, cloth and its products, paper, tobacco, etc., will be removed. On the inbound side, all restrictions will be lifted except for rice (excluding glutinous rice), wheat, wheat flour, beans, and cotton. (2) Restrictions on movement near Shanghai, which were previously implemented jointly by China and Japan, are planned to be abolished in the near future. At that time, the permitting affairs of the Japanese Army and Navy will be abolished, and the newly established National Commercial Control Association will implement them. However, permits already issued by the Japanese Army and Navy will continue to be valid within the specified period. (3) Restrictions on movement within the region will be abolished, except as specifically stipulated. However, the flow of materials to the Chongqing area will be strictly prohibited as before. (4) The Sino-Japanese authorities will separately implement control in accordance with these regulations. The Japanese army will generally not directly implement it, except when it is particularly necessary for military purposes, and in areas close to the Chongqing area and along the coast."</p>
<p>Minister Mei Shi's Statement</p>
<p>Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Regarding the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association, Minister Mei Shi of the Ministry of Industry made the following statement: "Since our country joined the war, economic issues have been of paramount importance. All the wartime economic policy outlines have been announced, and various specific plans are being designed and gradually implemented. The wartime government's responsibilities are, on the one hand, to ensure military supplies, and on the other hand, to strive to revive the economy, and in particular, to implement reasonable control measures as soon as possible to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods. However, reasonable economic control must be consistent between officials and the people, and cooperation between superiors and subordinates, in order to achieve rapid results. The soundness and collectivization of commercial organizations must be promoted as soon as possible. This time, in order to implement the fundamental strategy of wartime economic control, the Ministry has specially formulated the Temporary Regulations for the Control of Wartime Materials Transfer, submitted them to the Supreme National Defense Conference for consideration, and requested the National Government to promulgate them, which will be implemented on March 16, in order to ease the previous control measures and gradually replenish the driving force for economic revival. At the same time, the Temporary Regulations for the National Commercial Control Association were formulated, submitted to the Supreme National Defense Conference for approval, and promulgated on the same day. We have also instructed leaders of industry and commerce in various places to organize the National Commercial Control Association to assist the government in handling materials control matters. The initiators of the association convened an inaugural meeting in Shanghai on March 11, and it will be formally established soon. The friendly armies, navies, and embassies have given full cooperation to the implementation of the materials control measures this time, greatly easing the past control measures, and making every effort to alleviate the suffering of the people, so that the activities of economic power can gradually enter the right track. We should not only be grateful for this goodwill, but also express our respect for this wise decision by the highest authorities of our friendly nation in China. As for the wartime materials transfer control measures, they are a temporary measure. In the future, when the lower-level organizations of the National Commercial Control Association can reach a stage of widespread strengthening, the association will be responsible for the autonomous control of all materials transfer. Therefore, we hope that the people in various places will understand the spirit of the government's policies, actively and automatically strengthen the organization of their own industries, and assist the government in realizing the goals set by the wartime economic policies as soon as possible. This is what we earnestly hope for."</p>

All political, economic, and cultural matters were also consistent with the wartime system, and the spirit of its people sacrificing everything to support the Greater East Asia War was worthy of our imitation.</p>
<p>American Technicians in Qinghai Encounter Difficulties</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 11th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to information obtained here, the work of developing the Northwest by the Chongqing government has aroused resentment among the local people and Muslims in the Northwest region, especially among the border ethnic groups in Qinghai. It is reported that a group of American agricultural technicians, including Johnson, arrived in Xining in mid-January. Because they inspected the local customs and habits, they violated Islamic commandments. In anger, the Muslims burned down the residence of Johnson and others. Therefore, the US government has protested to the Chongqing government.</p>
<h3>Memorial of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Death; Chairman Wang's Address</h3>
<p>Dr. Sun Yat-sen's dying testament clearly stated that the purpose of the National Revolution was to seek China's freedom and equality, and that the method to achieve this purpose was to awaken the masses and unite with nations in the world that treat us equally to struggle together. The starting point of the struggle was to abolish unequal treaties. After Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, his comrades continued to uphold his legacy, unwavering. Today, our friendly nation Japan first fulfilled its promise to assist China in achieving independence, returning concessions and abolishing extraterritoriality. Friendly nations such as Italy followed. The Treaty of Nanjing was the beginning of unequal treaties, and its poison has spread for more than a century. It has finally been reduced. We are not only grateful that unequal treaties have been abolished, but also grateful that we have united with nations that treat us equally. Today, on the 18th memorial of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, we respectfully inform Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven and vow to sincerely follow his teachings, continue to work hard, lead the masses to advance in unison, and work together with our friendly nation to strive for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War, in order to complete China's liberation and realize the co-prosperity of East Asia. Today, we trace Dr. Sun Yat-sen's life and unfinished ambitions, and in addition to our sorrow, we are even more inspired. We can only rouse the spirit of courage, diligence, perseverance, and hard work to shoulder the mission of revitalizing China and defending East Asia. After we sincerely pray before Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit today, we will also pay our respects before the spirits of the martyrs of the National Revolution and the martyrs of our friendly nation Japan who assisted in the Chinese Revolution. May our spirit forever merge with the spirit of the martyrs and continuously advance towards the bright road indicated by our Dr. Sun Yat-sen, without interruption.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Capture Huarong and Other Places; Continuing to Expand Gains; Japanese Air Force Attacks Shashi, Inflicting Heavy Damage on Chongqing Troops; Chongqing Troops in the Dongting Lake Area Surrounded</h3>
<p>Hankou, 11th (Central News Agency) - Since completely occupying Shishou and Ouchi Kou on the morning of the 10th, Japanese troops have seized control of the Wang Jia He waterway on the Yangtze River, leading to Changsha and Changde. Because the Chongqing troops' retreat route was cut off, they had no choice but to retreat eastward towards the Dongshan Mountains. However, another powerful Japanese unit attacked from the east, and with the cooperation of the air force, fiercely attacked the Chongqing troops "149th Division, 445th Regiment," "150th Division, 448th Regiment," and remnants of the "197th Division" and "118th Division" wandering in the Dongshan Mountains, continuing to expand their gains.</p>
<p>Hankou, 11th (Central News Agency) - In order to assist the ground units advancing from the Shashi area, the Japanese air force, starting on the morning of the 9th, fiercely bombed the Chongqing troops retreating westward. On the morning of the 10th, large formations bombed about 300 remnants of the Chongqing troops near Huang Jia Zui, four kilometers southwest of Mituosi, and flew to the airspace over Miji Tai, sixteen kilometers southwest of Mituosi, bombing about 500 soldiers of the Chongqing 161st Division in the river, inflicting heavy damage.</p>
<p>Hankou, 11th (Central News Agency) - Since Japanese troops successively captured the strategic points of Shishou, Ouchi Kou, Jiang Bo Du, Huarong, Songmu Qiao and Mo Shan Guan on the 10th, the triangular area between the Yangtze River and Dongting Lake has been completely surrounded by Japanese troops. About four regiments of Chongqing troops are surrounded in this area. Due to constant bombing by Japanese planes and fierce attacks by ground units, they are in extreme distress and in great confusion. Their annihilation is imminent.</p>
<p>Hankou, 11th (Central News Agency) - After a certain elite Japanese unit occupied the key point of Shishou on the morning of the 10th, another powerful unit was sent to break into Jiang Bo Du, a key waterway at the junction of the Yangtze River and Wang Jia He, about 60 kilometers northwest of Yuezhou and 15 kilometers south of Shishou, and completely occupied it at 8:40 on the 11th. Jiang Bo Du is located at the junction of the Yangtze River and Wang Jia He and is a key point for transportation between Hunan and Hubei. After the Japanese troops quickly occupied the area, they were able to use the waterway to cut off the retreat route of the Chongqing troops fleeing towards Changsha and Changde.</p>
<p>Hankou, 11th (Central News Agency) - In order to respond to the units that captured the strongholds of Shishou and Ouchi Kou on the 10th, a certain elite Japanese unit also crossed the Yangtze River and advanced southward on the same day, breaking into Huarong, an important stronghold of the Chongqing troops, at 8:30 AM, and completely occupied the area after clearing out the remaining enemies.</p>
<p>Hankou, 11th (Central News Agency) - Huarong, an important stronghold of the Chongqing troops, was completely occupied by Japanese troops on the morning of the 10th. The Japanese air force also closely cooperated with the ground units from the morning of the same day to fiercely bomb the Chongqing troops fleeing from Huarong, inflicting heavy damage.</p>
<p>Hankou, 11th (Central News Agency) - A certain Japanese unit attacking from the east continued to launch fierce attacks the night before. Its powerful advance unit first occupied Mo Shan Pu at dawn on the 10th, and then occupied Songmu Qiao at 9:30 AM, continuing to advance rapidly towards a certain direction. Mo Shan Pu and Songmu Qiao are located in the Dongshan Mountains, 40 kilometers northwest of Yuezhou, and the eastern end borders Dongting Lake, which is a key transportation hub. Because they were quickly captured by the Japanese troops this time, the Chongqing troops' retreat route was cut off, and they have fallen into great confusion.</p>

<h3>German Troops Launch 200,000-Strong Counter-Offensive; Fierce Fighting Near Kharkov; German Troops in the Central Sector Adopt Evasive Tactics</h3>
<p>Führer Headquarters, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - Today's German war report stated that after German troops annihilated two Soviet regiments yesterday, they reached the outskirts of Kharkov and are currently engaged in fierce fighting in the northern and western suburbs of the city. Airplanes were also dispatched to bomb the retreating Soviet troops. Yesterday, Soviet troops repeatedly attacked the Kupiansk bridgehead, but were all heavily defeated by our troops. On the Orel front, Soviet attacks also failed. Our defensive warfare achieved great success. Our troops in the central sector moved according to plan and were not hindered by the enemy in the slightest. From March 1st to the 10th, a total of 773 Soviet tanks were destroyed.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 11th (Allied Press) - Berlin officially announced last night that German troops are implementing a planned strategy to cut off Soviet troops in the Kharkov area. Highways and railways south, southwest, west, and northwest of the city were cut off on Tuesday. Only one road to the northeast of the city remains open. Taking advantage of the Red Army's diversion of troops to reinforce Kharkov, German troops launched a large-scale counter-offensive southwest and northwest of Kursk. Moscow officially acknowledged yesterday that the situation in the south is serious. Reuters' correspondent in Moscow telegraphed last night that the southern Red Army has lost the initiative and that new developments in the war situation have put the Red Army in a difficult position, which is undeniable. Although the Red Army is still launching offensives in the central sector south of Lake Ilmen, it has had to adopt a defensive posture on the 200-mile front from Kharkov to Rostov. The main German forces are now concentrated on a narrow front south of Kharkov, launching fierce counter-offensives. A major battle involving tanks and infantry is underway in this muddy plain. The overall situation in the south will depend on this battle. The German combat force has a total of 100,000 troops, half of whom are new recruits, and many armored vehicles. Although the Red Army intends to defend to the death, the German offensive has not weakened. As for the situation in the central sector, west of Moscow, German troops continue to shorten their defense lines according to plan. The German High Command announced yesterday that German troops have withdrawn from Bely, a city southwest of Rzhev and 75 miles northeast of Smolensk.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - The German counter-offensive southwest of Kursk is progressing rapidly. After German infantry discovered that Soviet troops had been diverted to reinforce the Kharkov area, they abandoned their defensive posture and launched a fierce counter-offensive. Soviet troops were forced to retreat to the east. German troops captured important positions and heavily damaged the enemy.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 11th (Havas News Agency) - The most noteworthy aspect of yesterday's fighting on the Eastern Front was the steady German advance towards Kharkov, which is now in danger of being surrounded. At the same time, the various German counter-offensives in the Kursk area are also progressing smoothly. After the Red Army recently transferred troops from that area to reinforce Kharkov, its positions were weakened. German troops were able to exploit this vulnerability and break through one of its positions. Although the Red Army claims that the German offensive towards Kharkov has been contained, it admits that German troops are steadily advancing northwest and west of the city. Moscow war reports describe the German pressure in the Kharkov area as "very strong," saying that German troops are fighting with large numbers of tanks and motorized units. Fierce fighting is also taking place west of Siversk. German troops are attempting to cross the Donets River near Kharkov, regardless of the strong Red Army resistance. As for the Orel area, according to German reports, the Red Army has repeatedly launched fierce attacks near the city. Moscow claims that these attacks are being conducted on a broad front. Fighting south of Kharkov has been hampered by the thawing ground, with only localized engagements. In the central sector, Berlin sources say that German troops are continuing their usual strategy of adopting evasive tactics against the enemy. Moscow war reports say that the Red Army has made slight progress east of Vyazma, occupying the Tinov Station on the railway from Vyazma to Kaluga. The Red Army has also made progress west and northwest of Zhizdra. Domanovo, between Zhizdra and Vyazma, is also in Red Army hands. The Red Army acknowledges that the war situation in that area is still fraught with difficulties, as the German side has sent large numbers of tanks and air force reinforcements, while the Red Army is short of both planes and tanks. In addition, the Germans implemented a scorched-earth policy when they withdrew from Vyazma, leaving nothing for the enemy to use, which has also hindered the Red Army's advance. On the northern front, especially south of Lake Ilmen and in the Staraya Russa area, the German side claims that the Red Army has launched scattered attacks. Moscow claims that the Red Army has occupied Novoramoshivo and Staroramoshivo west of Ilmen. Observers generally believe that General Timoshenko's Red Army is repeatedly probing, with its main goal being to break a gap in the German lines near Leningrad and in the central sector. Moscow admits that Timoshenko has encountered very strong resistance.</p>
<h3>Berlin Announces Recent Submarine Successes: 36 Enemy Ships Sunk</h3>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - According to a report released by the Führer's Headquarters, German submarines attacking a convoy from the United States to England recently sank 13 enemy ships, totaling 73,000 tons, all carrying munitions. Another three were destroyed by torpedoes. In total, German submarines have sunk 36 enemy ships in the last 24 hours, totaling approximately 207,000 tons.</p>
<p>Führer's Headquarters, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - The German High Command announced yesterday that German submarines have sunk another 23 enemy ships in the past few days, totaling 237,000 tons. In addition to the eight enemy ships sunk that were announced on Monday, German submarines have sunk another 15 enemy ships in the Atlantic, totaling 82,000 tons, bringing the total to 23. In addition, another six enemy ships were damaged by torpedoes. As a result, enemy ships sunk in March have reached 231,000 tons. Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - The German High Command announced that German submarines recently sank 134,000 tons of enemy ships. In addition to the eight convoys that were attacked, the cargo ship "California Star" (8,300 tons) was also sunk. The ship was carrying approximately 9,000,000 pounds of fresh meat and 15,000,000 pounds of butter. German submarines attacked a convoy near the Cape of Good Hope, sinking two-thirds of the ships in the convoy.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Havas News Agency) - Thirty sailors belonging to merchant ships sunk by Axis submarines in the South Atlantic have landed in Georgetown, British Guiana.</p>
<p>Ship Losses Kept Secret by Britain</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 10th (Havas News Agency) - At a recent meeting of the British House of Commons, Labor MP Mr. Dinnage inquired about the situation of ship losses, saying, "The government does not publish the figures for merchant ship losses, and only says that we have lost 435 warships of various sizes since the start of the war, which is useless. During the last World War, Britain lost a total of 14,000 sailors. Are the loss figures for this war even higher than last time? I don't know if the government is prepared to publish them. I think the current state of British merchant ships must be actively improved, because I think opening a second front is important, but improving shipping is even more beneficial to the Soviet Union, that can be asserted." In response, Hall, a representative of the Naval Department, denied that the Naval Department opposed the construction of high-speed ships, and strongly stated that the British government should continue to keep ship losses secret and not announce them.</p>
<h3>Naval Battle Occurs off the Dutch Coast: One British Ship Sunk</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 11th (Haitong News Agency) The British Admiralty announced that one British warship was sunk in a battle with enemy ships off the Dutch coast. Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - The night before, British motor torpedo boats attempted to attack a German convoy near the Dutch coast, but lost five torpedo boats. Three of them were sunk by German warships, and another two caught fire. The sailors abandoned ship and fled. Fourteen rescued Britons were captured.</p>
<h3>Stalemate on the North African Front: Only Reconnaissance Activities</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Allied Press) - A Reuters correspondent with the Allied Forces headquarters in North Africa said that the Tunisian climate is harsh and that land warfare is limited to reconnaissance activities. Berlin sources said the same.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - Authoritative sources announced that the situation on the North African front was calm on Tuesday. A small number of units of the British Eighth Army approached the Mareth Line but did not dare to advance within range of the Axis artillery. Small units of British tanks were active in northern Tunisia but achieved nothing. Remnants of French troops and light American and British mechanized units were discovered in southwestern Tunisia but showed no signs of attacking.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 11th (Havas News Agency) - There were no major battles on the Tunisian front yesterday. According to the war reports of Germany and Italy, there is little to report other than the bombing of the port of Algiers, which hit one American merchant ship. In addition, the commander of the separatist French forces issued a war report stating that French troops made slight progress near Metlaoui (located between Tozeur and Gafsa).</p>
<h3>Dissatisfaction Expressed on All Sides with the Strategy Adopted by the British Naval Authorities</h3>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 10th (Havas News Agency) - According to reports from London, Admiral Keyes gave a speech in Cambridge today, strongly criticizing the strategy adopted by the Admiralty in this war. He said, "The establishment of various committees within the Admiralty has diminished the initiative and daring of the British Navy to nothing. In fact, our sailors only need the High Command to be able to disregard danger to achieve great merit, and they will do it well. But now the naval authorities are not adopting this wise policy, and are sitting idly by while the Soviet Union and Japan are engaged in naval warfare, which is a great shame for us. The naval authorities have made countless mistakes since the Norwegian campaign."</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - The London correspondent for the Swiss "Gongxun Bao" recently said that even if the British Home Fleet does not move, it can keep the German fleet stationed in its base and restrain its activities. The British Admiralty believes that since Admiral Dönitz became the commander of the German Navy, he will use combined submarine warships to attack convoys, so it should try to restrain the German warships in the base. The United States believes that the US Navy has suffered heavy losses in the Pacific, so it urgently hopes that Britain can send more fleets to the Pacific. Therefore, it is deeply dissatisfied with the British Home Fleet's inaction. In Britain, however, it is naturally best to preserve its strength, so the so-called restraining German naval activities is nothing more than an excuse.</p>
<h3>The Importance of Today's Ships, by Kanda Tomowo, Vice President of Osaka Shosen</h3>
<p>In peacetime, shipping certainly plays an extremely important role in the progress of national strength in terms of economy, industry, culture, and other aspects. This goes without saying; but in wartime, ships are not only absolutely necessary, but also necessarily needed in large quantities, as everyone knows.</p>
<p>Especially during this Greater East Asia War, our country is actually conducting operations in a vast area, and as the occupied areas continue to expand, it will inevitably require an increase in shipping capacity, so no matter how many ships there are, it always feels insufficient.</p>
<p>Therefore, our country's central task is to use all our energy to manufacture ships; however, if we want to manufacture steel ships that are currently sailing, this is the most complex industrial form in various industrial sectors. For example, to build one ship, dozens of materials and more than two thousand kinds of parts are required, and if one of these parts is missing, no matter how hard you try, you will not be able to achieve anything.</p>
<p>Before the war, most of these materials and parts were sought from abroad, but now the source has been cut off. Although we are trying our best to save consumption domestically, various domestic projects are increasing and demand is frequent, and the demand for steel ships is skyrocketing, which is really difficult to cope with.</p>
<p>Although it is very difficult to increase the production of steel ships, we must overcome the shortage of ships and eliminate any difficulties. We are in an era where we must highly develop shipping capacity. Those engaged in shipping urgently demand the manufacture of wooden ships, and are determined to desperately and formally manufacture wooden ships in large quantities to improve and increase shipping capacity.</p>
<p>As far back as the middle of the nineteenth century, only wooden ships were manufactured, but wooden ships such as those known in Japan as "Shuinsen" crossed the oceans. Later, when the iron smelting method was invented, wooden-iron composite ships and iron ships were built, and gradually developed into today's steel ships. From 30 or 40 years ago, the use of wooden ships decreased year by year, and in recent years, except for a few small ships, they have been almost non-existent. However, in wartime, it is natural for wooden ships to appear because steel inevitably cannot meet the demand. Based on this concept, we still have a vague pain in our hearts, wondering why we did not actively build wooden ships at the beginning of the China Incident.</p>
<p>Even today, ordinary people still seem to underestimate the transportation capacity of wooden ships, but this is a big mistake. Although there are differences in the scope of shipping, its transportation capacity is truly not to be underestimated when applied to coastal routes. We are in an era when we urgently need a dramatic increase in ships. Wooden ships replacing steel ships provide very favorable conditions in all aspects.</p>
<p>For example, there is almost no shortage of materials for building wooden ships, and the shortage of labor can also be overcome. In particular, the construction time can be greatly shortened. Combining these points, and if we add a high degree of rationalization, I dare say that mass production is by no means difficult.</p>
<p>This time, the reason why our Osaka Shosen Company is the first to mass-produce these wooden ships is because the uses in various aspects are gradually expanding, and because we never take a business perspective as a premise for this enterprise, nor do we take the company's interests as a premise, but only want to work hard to enrich the wartime shipping, and it is with this strong determination that we started.</p>
<p>Therefore, our company has been engaged in multi-faceted research based on the experience and technology accumulated over many years. First, in order to find a production location, we traveled all over the country, and as a result, we believe that Shichisei Port in Ishikawa Prefecture is the most suitable place, so we decided to mass-produce here.</p>
<p>Although on the surface this place may seem inconvenient, in essence, in terms of topography, materials, labor and other conditions, it can be said to be the most complete compared to other places, and at the end of the shogunate era, it was the naval ship of the Kaga domain, and it was also the birthplace of the shipbuilding industry in Japan.</p>
<p>Later, this shipyard became the predecessor of Kawasaki Shipyard. Due to the changes of the times, our company, which is shouldering the mission of this great war, started mass production of wooden ships with a capital of 5 million yen. From the perspective of our shipbuilding industry, we believe that this has a lot of historical significance.</p>
<p>In addition to the production of wooden ships, the company has also established close horizontal contacts in shipping, and established a wooden ship shipping company with a capital of 10 million yen. Thus, in terms of vertical production and horizontal shipping, organic and rational connections have been established, and with a new attitude, it is actively carrying out its mission in this great war in its own shipping position.</p>
<p>Fortunately, our government has recently begun to work hard to mass-produce wooden ships, and is providing low-interest loans to finance the manufacture of standard wooden ships just like steel ships. In this critical period, our company is the first to start manufacturing wooden ships, which is truly a glorious achievement.</p>
<p>Although the tonnage of the ships and other matters are still under review, the Maritime Affairs Bureau has already announced that the tonnage of standard wooden ships is 250 tons, 150 tons, and 100 tons. Therefore, the company is currently using all its energy to produce the 250-ton wartime standard wooden ships announced by the Maritime Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>Now the battle lines have expanded to tens of thousands of nautical miles in the vast ocean, so even one steel ship should be used overseas. In this sense, the mission of wooden ship shipping is, of course, even more urgent and important. (Translated from the February issue of "Real World of Industry")</p>
<h3>Italian Army Deputy Chief of Staff Selected</h3>
<p>Rome, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - General Rossi has been selected as the new Army Deputy Chief of Staff. Rossi is 58 years old and has been serving as a staff member since 1921. On March 24, 1941, he was promoted to Deputy Minister of the Army.</p>
<h3>British Headquarters on Cyprus Destroyed</h3>
<p>Ankara, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - According to reports, the Palace Hotel on Cyprus (eastern Mediterranean), where the British military headquarters is located, has been completely destroyed by bombing. Five soldiers were killed and sixty women were injured. Four fire brigades and 1,000 soldiers are currently conducting rescue work. The cause of the explosion is still unknown.</p>
<h3>Song Meiling is About to Leave America and Return Home</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Havas) – According to a dispatch from New York, Chiang Kai-shek's wife, after a brief stay in Washington, has now arrived in New York. After a few days, she will return to Chongqing soon.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – According to well-informed sources in New York, Madame Chiang Kai-shek originally planned to travel around various departments in the United States for publicity, appealing for aid to Chongqing. This plan must now be abandoned. Madame Chiang's doctor believes that her physical condition cannot withstand such hardship and has advised her to shorten her itinerary.</p>
<h3>Chongqing's Embassy and Consulate Staff in France Arrive in Lisbon, Portugal</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Allied News Agency) – Fifty-nine officials from the Chongqing government's embassy and consulates in France arrived here yesterday by train from France.</p>
<h3>U.S. Lend-Lease Act Extended for One Year; Passed by Both Houses of Congress</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Havas) – According to a dispatch from Washington, the U.S. Senate today unanimously voted to extend the Lend-Lease Act for one year. The House of Representatives also passed the bill by a vote of 407 to 6.</p>
<h3>Analysis of Germany's Inevitable Victory: Coordination between Front and Rear Ensures No Repetition of WWI Mistakes</h3>
<p>Germany is now taking on a general mobilization posture from top to bottom in preparation for the upcoming spring offensive. Recently, a Nazi mouthpiece compared and examined the situation in which Germany found itself during the last World War and this World War from military, economic, and political perspectives. The conclusion was: Although the enemy is using the example of the last World War to propagate that Germany will still win first and lose later this time, the painful experience of Germany winning before and losing the war during the last World War is still fresh in the memory of Germans. Therefore, in this World War, it will never repeat the mistakes of the 1918 failure, and will wholeheartedly move towards the path of victory.</p>
<p>Military Situation</p>
<p>During the last World War, the German army on the Western Front was blocked in its offensive in northern France, occupying only part of France. Part of Belgium was also in enemy hands, and the entire French coast and the English Channel were under enemy control. In Alsace, the enemy even invaded German-occupied territory, while the Netherlands, Denmark, and Norway all maintained neutrality.</p>
<p>In contrast, today's German army has secured the entire Atlantic coast from Norway to the Spanish border. The French army, Germany's strongest enemy in the last World War, has now collapsed, and French industry is under German control. Moreover, German submarines have now made great progress in technology and are using the entire Atlantic coast as a base. In the south, the German and Austrian armies fought against Italy during the last World War, but this time Italy is our friend. Without the presence of the French Navy, the Mediterranean coast of France, Italy, Greece, and Portugal is under German-Italian control. Romania participated on the enemy's side during the last World War, but this time it is allied with us, and we are using its oil production. Furthermore, Africa, which was an enemy supply area during the last war, is now where German, Italian, British, and American forces are fighting, tying up their forces.</p>
<p>Moreover, Japan participated on the side of the Allied Powers during the last World War, but this time it has become Germany's ally, achieving brilliant victories, seizing important resources that were completely free for the enemy to use, and using these areas as operational bases to threaten the lifelines of Britain and the United States, tying up almost the entire American fleet, merchant ships, and most of the air force in the Pacific, while cooperating with German submarine warfare on all the seas of the world. In India, Britain must maintain considerable forces to prevent Japanese attacks. And Australian ships and soldiers can no longer cooperate on the European battlefield as they did during the last World War.</p>
<p>Economic Resources</p>
<p>In terms of food, during the last World War, the enemy's blockade caused a panic of shortage. The initial reserves were illegally manipulated by Jews, the implementation of the rationing system was delayed, and the rations gradually decreased. By the winter of the third year of the war, it had fallen into the most tragic situation. However, in this World War, rations are sought to be fair, while ensuring food for the front and rear. In the winter of the third year, special additional rations are being implemented. Due to the acquisition of the fertile agricultural areas of the Soviet Union, the freedom of food has been established.</p>
<p>In this World War, the enemy's raw material transport is much longer and more circuitous than in the last World War, requiring a lot of time and escorting ships for transportation. And it is threatened by German submarines and air force everywhere. Moreover, the enemy's supply bases during the last World War have now become German naval and air force operational bases. In the last World War, the enemy actually used the entire shipping space of the world (shipping space is the general term for the tonnage and number of ships), but now the ships of Japan and Italy are no longer available, and most of the shipping space and canals of various countries occupied by Germany have been seized by Germany, so the enemy almost only has its own shipping space and must meet its needs, which are much greater than last time.</p>
<p>Political Situation</p>
<p>During the last World War, Germany was a country of party politics, lacking unified military and political guidance. The Social Democratic Party, the largest political party, even claimed to be an anti-national party, preparing for a proletarian revolution and even inciting workers' strikes in military supply factories. The Center Party colluded with the enemy, and the Emperor of Austria-Hungary even secretly plotted a separate peace, giving the enemy confidence in their victory. Jews and Freemasons, who were in cahoots with the political parties, danced and jumped around in the economic and other sectors, plotting Germany's defeat. The government was weak and could do nothing about it. After the war, the backpacks of veterans returning to the motherland were covered with anti-war leaflets. This was the state of affairs at the time. In contrast, today's Germany, under the guidance of Führer Hitler, is completely unified in military and political affairs, and is moving towards the path of victory with strong leadership. The enemy has no room to maneuver. (Ding: Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, March 5th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt to Issue Statement Clarifying U.S.-Soviet Relations; Stanley and Molotov Held Talks, Probably Related to Recent Gaffe</h3>
<p>Argentina, 11th (Central News Agency) – According to news from Washington received here, it is generally believed that U.S. President Roosevelt will soon issue a statement regarding the gaffe made by U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Stanley, in order to clarify the current state of U.S.-Soviet relations. According to the New York Times, at a time when U.S.-Soviet relations are strained, Stanley may be summoned back for his gaffe.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 11th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Moscow, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Stanley visited Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the afternoon of the 10th and held important talks. It is said that the meeting may be related to the recent gaffe, and it is rumored that Stanley will meet with Stalin on this issue.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Washington, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union General Stanley criticized the Soviet government for failing to understand U.S. aid to the Soviet Union, which coincided with the U.S. Congressional debate on increasing aid to the Soviet Union. The attitude of Congress will obviously be affected by Stanley's remarks. Congressional figures believe that the Soviet government is quite concerned that after expressing understanding of aid from the Allied Powers, the Soviet people will develop pro-Allied sentiments. The Soviet government knows that there may be disputes with the Allied Powers after the war, so it does not want to express understanding of the Allied Powers' aid. The Soviet Union also does not want to exchange military intelligence with the Allied Powers and refuses to allow American military observers to visit Soviet defense lines. Stanley's remarks will strengthen the anti-Soviet sentiment in the U.S. Congress.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Havas) – According to a dispatch from Washington, Under Secretary of State Welles stated that he had telegraphed U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Stanley, requesting that he report the full text of his speech to the press in Moscow to the State Department. American newspapers are still commenting heavily on Stanley's speech, especially the editorial published by the New York Herald Tribune. The article roughly stated, "Stanley has made a statement, but his statement is absurd. After this incident, should the United States adopt a unified foreign policy to replace the current divergent foreign policy? Would it not be better if we could correct our attitude, make our words and actions consistent, and have an experienced and capable diplomat in charge?"</p>
<h3>American Aircraft Bomb French Cities</h3>
<p>Vichy, 10th (Havas) – American bomber groups again bombed various French cities yesterday, causing damage to residential areas and casualties among residents. The main targets of the bombing were a town near Nantes and an area near Valenciennes.</p>
<p>Vichy, 10th (Havas) – According to official announcements, American bomber groups bombed Rennes, the capital of Brittany province, on the night of the 8th of this month, causing heavy civilian casualties. It is estimated that 250 people were killed and 400 injured, many of whom were women and children. Residential areas suffered the most damage. Once the cleanup is complete, it is often found that the number of casualties is more than this. Rennes is far from the coast and even further from the German artillery batteries on the coast. There are no military targets in the city. The American aircraft's bombing of undefended cities this time has aroused indignation among the people of France.</p>
<h3>German and British Aircraft Bomb Each Other</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 10th (Havas) – It has been learned that British aircraft bombed the German city of Munich and its suburbs last night, destroying several buildings and monuments. Twelve British aircraft were lost. Western Germany was also bombed. British aircraft appeared over Germany again today.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – Responsible sources stated that German aircraft raided the port of Hull on Tuesday night. The visibility was clear, and many bombs hit their targets, causing numerous large fires on the ground. That night, other German aircraft also bombed several cities at the mouth of the Humber River, the Portland area, and Woolsington. The latter had a gas plant hit and set on fire. All German aircraft returned safely afterward, without any losses.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – Local officials pointed out that after British aircraft bombed historical buildings in Lübeck and other places, they bombed famous buildings in southern Germany again. Medieval buildings in central Nuremberg were deliberately bombed by British aircraft. British aircraft attacked Munich the night before and did not bomb military targets, but only attacked civilians and art buildings.</p>
<h3>Latvian Warriors Join Anti-Soviet Legion</h3>
<p>Riga, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – Latvian warriors who have received the Bear Slayer Medal are now also joining the newly established Latvian Anti-Soviet Legion. The Bear Slayer Medal is Latvia's highest military decoration.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Establishes Strategic Posture of Inevitable Victory on the Pacific Front</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) – Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, although it has only been a year, the Japanese army has established a posture of inevitable victory and invincibility in both military and economic aspects. It is now launching offensives everywhere, from the Aleutian Islands in the north to the Solomon Islands and Australia in the south, and on the borderlines of mainland China, Burma, and India, crushing the enemy's attempts at counterattack. This further proves the strength of the Japanese army. The Japanese army in the South Pacific, under the cover of the defense forces on Guadalcanal Island and the vicinity of Yina, has launched strategic operations on the important front lines in the northern Solomon Islands and New Guinea, and completed the preparation of strategic strongholds in early February to adapt to the new operational posture. Afterwards, the elite aviation units of the Japanese army in that area were extremely active, penetrating deep into the rear of the United States and Australia, and launching fierce attacks. Among them, the raid on the New Hebrides Islands in February is a glimpse of the active situation of the Japanese air force. The great victories won by the Japanese army in the Pacific from February 16th to March 6th show the strength of the Japanese army. However, the enemy still holds the islands of New Caledonia, New Hebrides, Fiji, Samoa, and Hawaii, which are interconnected, as a communication line between the United States and Australia, and at the same time occupies air forces such as Guadalcanal Island, Port Moresby, and Darwin, which are interconnected. The enemy's intention is obviously to attack the Japanese mainland from the north of the United States, and to recapture the islands of Ryukyu and Mingami occupied by the Japanese army. The enemy uses the vicinity of Dutch Harbor as a base to attack the vicinity of Attu and Adak Islands, cutting off Tata Island (250 kilometers from Mingami Island), and attacking the Japanese-occupied islands with several or dozens of aircraft from time to time. At the same time, the enemy completed the 2,800-kilometer Alaska Highway in November last year, using Alaska as a base for attacking Japan, as an artery to the mainland United States. Therefore, the United States uses the northern Aleutian Islands and Alaska as the root base for Japanese counterattacks, and at the same time as a communication line with the Soviet Union, and is actively increasing its strength in that area. However, Ryukyu and Mingami Islands, the advanced stations of the war line, are strongly defended by the brave and well-fighting Japanese army, and the situation is extremely solid. Once spring arrives, the situation on the northern front will be vigorously developed. After the enemy's attempts to counterattack against Japan in the South Pacific and Australia were severely hit, they realized the failure of the anti-Axis operations, and then planned to use the base of the Chongqing army to directly attack the Japanese mainland. The United States continues to increase its air force stationed in Chongqing after the Burma Road was cut off. Although its forward base has been attacked by the elite units of the Japanese army's land and air forces, it still attempts to continue to move. The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing is currently commanded by Major General Chennault and has about 150 aircraft, which is equal to the remaining air force in Chongqing. Since the Yunnan-Burma Road was cut off, its gasoline and bombs have only been supplied by air transport, and the number is very small. Chongqing has now completely become a dependency of Britain and the United States, because although Chongqing claims to have sworn 3 million troops, and aims to establish a posture of resistance, and is engaged in the development of the Northwest and other work, it will not succeed without American assistance. Therefore, Song Meiling went to the United States to seek assistance. However, this time the National Government's participation in the war and the changes in Japan's policy towards China have given the Chongqing side a great blow. The Japanese army resolutely launched a spring offensive, which gave the Chongqing side a fatal blow. The enemy's attempt to recapture Burma is still the same as in the past, only making a big propaganda. Although Britain, the United States, and Chongqing held a military conference in New Delhi and attempted to invade the western Japanese army's position in Burma, they were immediately annihilated by the Japanese army. This was the first operation they advertised to recapture Burma. After that, although they still tried to move, they were all defeated by the Japanese army. Although the enemy air force in India also repeatedly carried out guerrilla warfare in Burma, it was defeated by the Japanese air force's counterattack. According to He Yingqin, he met with British Indian Army Commander Wavell in eastern India, and Luo Zhuoying, the commander of the Chongqing army in India, went to Guilin to meet with Zhang Fakui to discuss the air supply between India and Kunming, but the Japanese army's deployment in Burma can crush the enemy's attempt at any time. The Japanese air force also raided Calcutta to destroy the enemy's base. Now the Japanese army has established a strategic posture of inevitable victory in that area.</p>

<p>Istanbul, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – Political observers here believe that the organization of the new Turkish cabinet is not surprising. The only surprising thing is that the discussion of the regular procedures took a whole day to achieve results, indicating that there must have been some difficulties in the discussion that needed to be negotiated before an agreement could be reached. Diplomatic circles welcome the establishment of the new cabinet and believe that the Turkish government is determined to maintain a neutral policy. Turkish newspapers all expressed welcome to the new government. Six of the ministers were reshuffled, and the Minister of Commerce and the Minister of Economy became experts.

<h3>Industrial and Commercial Sectors Autonomously Organize the General Association for Commercial Control; Responsible for the Control of Materials; Changing Restrictions on the Movement of Materials; The Authorities are Comprehensively Planning</h3>
<p>In order to uniformly purchase materials nationwide and concentrate distribution, the authorities are planning to establish a National General Association for Commercial Control. The association will be the highest control organ for the purchase and distribution of materials nationwide, encompassing and unifying all existing Chinese and Japanese commercial organizations. Therefore, after its establishment, it will make a great contribution to the revitalization of material exchanges in all aspects. The general association will be located in Shanghai, and the organization of the board of directors will be centered on the municipal chamber of commerce, enlisting powerful figures from the private financial world as members. As for the local branches, they will also use the existing organizations of the chambers of commerce in various places. What should be considered is that the chambers of commerce in various places have many sectarian characteristics. Therefore, before using them, they must be reorganized. Before the reorganization, the Commercial Association Law and the Trade Association Law must be amended by the government. As for the agencies affiliated to the association, such as the Material Control Association and the Commercial Federation, they are also jointly organized by Chinese and Japanese commercial figures, but the core lies in the Chinese side. After the establishment of the National General Association for Commercial Control, it will take the unified purchase and distribution of materials as its main task. The previously promulgated Material Movement Restriction Law is also expected to be abolished with the establishment of the association. This matter is of great importance to promoting material exchanges, establishing countermeasures for industrial raw materials, reducing domestic prices, and correcting the bias of materials. Therefore, all parties are paying close attention. Mr. Masutaro Kimura, consultant to the Central Reserve Bank, also issued a statement on this, meaning that the reorganization of the material purchase and distribution mechanism and the revision or abolition of the material movement restriction will have a good impact on the circulation of materials and the maintenance of the value of reserve coupons.</p>
<p>Promoters' Meeting</p>
<p>Shanghai News from the Central News Agency, yesterday (11th) at 4 pm, the inaugural meeting of the National General Association for Commercial Control was held at the Shanghai branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association on 司非而路. The attendees included leaders from the banking, yarn, department store, chemical industry, tobacco industry, and municipal chambers of commerce: Tang Shoumin, Zhou Zuomin, Wu Zhenxiu, Ye Fuxiao, Pei Yunqing, Huang Jiangquan, Li Ze, Chen Shuili, Guo Shun, Esakami Toru, Do Ryokei, Ro Shigaku, Kyo Kangun, Ri Sohan, Son Shinritsu, Sai Seihaku, Tei Kokyo, En Tozan, Mon Ranko, Rin Kako, and others, totaling twenty people. Also present were Secretary-General Zhao of the Municipal Government, Director Wang of the Economic Bureau, and directors from various bureaus of the Ministry of Industry: Guo Hong, Chen Zhong, Xiang Kou, Sun Zuji, Zhang Jun, etc. Minister Mei Hua Lu, made a special visit to deliver a speech yesterday.</p>
<p>Minister Mei's Speech</p>
<p>Stated briefly, "The Provisional Regulations of the National General Association for Commercial Control were approved by the National Defense Conference this morning (11th) and will be promulgated immediately. This time, in order to adapt to the wartime economic system and implement the control of materials, the government has, after several consultations with the friendly Japanese authorities, entrusted the Chinese industrial and commercial sectors to autonomously organize an agency to handle material control matters. The government is responsible for supervision and guidance. Under the equal treatment and close cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese industrial and commercial sectors, the aim is to stabilize people's livelihoods, increase production, and achieve the grand effect of winning the Greater East Asia War. The organizational system of this agency can be divided into three levels: (1) trade associations of various industries in various places, (2) federations of various industries, and (3) the National General Association for Commercial Control. The tasks of purchasing, manufacturing, distributing, and exchanging materials will be borne by this agency, which will handle them separately. I hope that all of you present will immediately open a preparatory meeting, and that officials and merchants will work together to promote it."</p>
<p>Preparatory Meeting</p>
<p>After Minister Mei finished his speech, the first preparatory meeting was immediately held. The promoters publicly elected Wen Lanping as the temporary chairman, and resolved that all promoters would be preparatory committee members, and appointed Tang Shoumin, Wu Zhenxiu, Lin Kanghou, Esakami Toru, and Kyo Kangun as members of the constitution drafting committee, who will begin to convene today and convene the second preparatory meeting tomorrow (13th), formally establish the association on the 15th, and host guests from all walks of life, and begin office work on the 16th.</p>
<h3>Chongming "Purification of the Countryside" Begins on April 15th; Large Coastal Blockade Line</h3>
<p>The "Purification of the Countryside" work in Chongming District is scheduled to begin on April 15th. Currently, all aspects of the work are being actively prepared. In order to facilitate the advancement of the work, the Special District Office has expanded the original four administrative districts into ten districts, and the jurisdiction of towns and villages has been reorganized. At the same time, a large blockade line will be built around the coast, which is expected to be completed by the end of March. The issuance of people's residence permits has been stepped up, so those applying for them have been extremely crowded in recent days. In order to thoroughly clarify the significance of the "Purification of the Countryside" to the people, the Chinese and Japanese authorities specially convened representatives from various levels the other day to hold a discussion meeting, listen to the people's opinions and suggestions on the "Purification of the Countryside", and answer the people's questions about the "Purification of the Countryside" at any time.</p>
<h3>Xiedaxiang and Other Stores Were Sealed Up Yesterday; Selling Goods at Excessive Prices</h3>
<p>The police authorities of the French Concession strictly manage stores of various industries within the concession, absolutely prohibit black market transactions, and dispatch a large number of secret agents to strictly investigate the circumstances of stores of various industries exceeding the price limits. A large number of stores have been investigated and dealt with. Several stores of various industries, such as Xiedaxiang, have been sealed up after being found to have violated business regulations. The sealing was officially executed yesterday (11th). The seal reads, "This store is ordered to close down by the Police Department for selling goods at excessive prices."</p>
<h3>Local Ordinary Publications: Registration Postponed to Conserve Resources</h3>
<p>The Propaganda Department recently stated that since the nature of various publication registrations and distributions in Shanghai are largely the same, and given the current scarcity of resources, it is especially important to conserve resources. Therefore, all registrations will be temporarily postponed. A special notice has been sent to the Shanghai Municipal Government requesting that the registration of publications without special characteristics be generally postponed.</p>
<h3>Bicycle Theft Approaching Its End: Thieves Carrying Bicycles Across Borders, Police from Three Areas Cooperating to Apprehend Them</h3>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Times* reported that according to the Assistant Commissioner of Police, cases of bicycle theft have significantly decreased in the past three weeks. This is because nearly half of the bicycles have been registered and stamped.</p>
<p>Police Cooperation</p>
<p>He stated that in these three weeks, fewer than twenty bicycles have been stolen. Previously, under the old licensing system, the average number of bicycle thefts per month was often around twenty-four. He explained that this strict change in the licensing system is due to the cooperation of the police in various municipal districts in the city, determined to eliminate thieves.</p>
<p>Registration Deadline</p>
<p>In order to create a joint network among the municipal districts to apprehend bicycle thieves, the bicycle registration period has been limited to two weeks. After this, bicycle theft will be completely eliminated. Therefore, the Assistant Commissioner hopes that residents will not delay registration to protect their bicycles. As for bicycle thieves who carry stolen bicycles across borders, the police will order officers stationed at border checkpoints and the police outside the borders to cooperate in the pursuit and arrest.</p>
<p>Emphasis on Bicycle Licenses</p>
<p>Not only should the license number match the number on the blue plate on the bicycle, but the number on the application form must also be the same when the case is reviewed. It was also stated that when a bicycle is stolen, the police in the three municipal districts will cooperate to investigate the whereabouts of the bicycle. Currently, the investigation work is easier to implement than before. Finally, in addition to asking residents to take good care of their bicycles, the Assistant Commissioner hopes that bicycle owners will cooperate to reduce bicycle theft to a minimum.</p>
<h3>Spokesperson of the Japanese Information Department Issues Statement</h3>
<p>The Information Department of the Japanese Army and Navy held a routine reception for the Chinese press corps in Shanghai yesterday (the 11th) at 3:00 PM. More than a dozen people from various newspapers and the Shanghai Press Association attended the meeting. The spokesperson of the Information Department of the Japanese Army gave a detailed explanation of the difficulties facing the British, American, and Chongqing forces in Burma, stating briefly that in early February of this year, Chiang Kai-shek of Chongqing convened a meeting in Chongqing. On February 11, it was reported that He Yingqin went to New Delhi, India, to hold discussions with British and American commanders. We observe that these</p>
<p>Two Meetings</p>
<p>Often did not result in any concrete measures. The aim of the British, American, and Chongqing forces is nothing more than to open the road to India as a base for launching offensives against Japan. According to the frequent troop movements of the Chongqing army, they are concentrating in Yunnan, intending to advance into India through Burma, and have appointed Chen Cheng of the "Sixth War Zone" as the commander-in-chief of the expeditionary force in Burma. However, Chongqing's troop deployments and dreams of launching an offensive are not a planned action with the understanding of the British and Americans. Therefore, Chongqing's attempt to counterattack Burma is, in fact, impossible. First, the Chongqing army is not acclimatized to the environment, and is plagued by miasma. Second, the local</p>
<p>Climate is Harsh</p>
<p>During the rainy season, diseases are rampant. Offensives can only be launched when the climate tends to be normal in mid-October. However, how to sustain and get through this long period is a concern. Now, for the sake of preemptive action, the Japanese army has already begun offensives in Burma. Furthermore, the Long Yun troops in Yunnan are under surveillance after the Chongqing army moved into Yunnan, and can be said to be powerless. In addition, the British army in India is even more afraid of death and unwilling to deplete its strength, only relying on using Indians to carry out sabotage, placing the Indian army on the front line, while the British</p>
<p>Are in the rear. In terms of numbers, the Indian army on the front line has about twelve divisions, and the British army in the rear has about four or five divisions. As for the strength of the British air force in India, although the exact number is unknown, it is speculated that its strength is not worth mentioning. In particular, the remaining American air force has no operational strength. Finally, it was mentioned that since the Japanese army moved into Guangzhou Bay according to the Franco-Japanese Agreement, the Guangxi army nearby has not stirred at all. Based on this observation, it can be determined that Chongqing has no power to launch a counterattack.</p>
<h3>Self-Defense Corps Member Commits Suicide While on Duty</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaodi, a local resident of No. 20 Lanxin Lane, Bailuer Road, French Concession, is 23 years old and works as a peddler. At around 7:10 PM last night, Wang, being a member of the Self-Defense Corps, was on duty at the guard post at the intersection of Jialu Road and Aolihe Road. Due to extreme poverty, he suddenly became disillusioned with life and secretly took poison to commit suicide. Before long, the poison took effect and became uncontrollable. He collapsed on the side of the road, on the verge of death. Passersby saw this and urgently called the police. Wang was taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment. It is reported that he took too much poison and his life is in danger.</p>

<h3>Central Reserve Bank Finances Continued Savings Operations: Authorities Issue Statement</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the Central Savings Society, operated by the Central Trust Bureau, a Chongqing institution, has been under the management of the Japanese military authorities since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. In order to stabilize people's livelihoods, it has been decided that the Central Reserve Bank will fund the establishment of a new Central Savings Society, inheriting all existing deposits and liabilities. Business will begin soon. The Japanese Embassy issued the following statement on the 11th: "The Central Savings Society is a financial institution funded and operated by the Central Trust Bureau, a Chongqing institution. It has been managed by the Japanese military. After investigating the contents, it was found that the society is a grassroots financial institution that absorbs small amounts of funds, and is closely related to the interests of the public. In order to stabilize people's livelihoods, it is deemed necessary to promptly and appropriately handle it. Therefore, its relationship with Chongqing is specifically severed, and the Central Reserve Bank will fund the establishment of a new Central Savings Society, inheriting its assets and liabilities to continue operations. The remaining assets of the old Central Savings Society will be liquidated. The specific methods for the Central Savings Society to inherit the management, liabilities, and operations of the old Central Savings Society will be determined later. The liquidation of the remaining assets of the New Central Savings Association has been entrusted to the Yokohama Specie Bank Shanghai Branch. The National Government has also issued a proclamation regarding the handling of the Central Savings Society."</p>
<p>Appointment of Supervisors</p>
<p>After the Central Savings Society's Articles of Association and the Regulations of the Supervisory Committee of the Society were passed by the 151st meeting of the Executive Yuan, it was reported that the Central Reserve Bank had, in accordance with Article 2 of the Regulations of the Supervisory Committee of the Central Savings Society which stipulates that the supervisory committee shall be composed of fifteen members, appointed three persons from among the directors and supervisors of the Central Reserve Bank designated by the President of the Central Reserve Bank. The remaining twelve persons are appointed from among those with experience and reputation in accordance with the regulations that state, "Three persons shall be reappointed every two years." The appointed persons include: Ye Fuxiao, Tang Shoumin, Wu Zhenxiu, Qin Runxiang, Guo Shun, Yuan Ludeng, Zhu Boquan, Pei Yunqing, Li Da, Pei Fuheng, Yang Xinghua, Ren Xishun, and other twelve persons. Also, Liu Ruxiang, Wu Jiyun, and Shao Shijun, three of the directors and supervisors of the bank, were appointed as members of the supervisory committee. Li Da was appointed as the manager of the society, Pei Fuheng, Zhang Xisan, and Zhou Shaojian were appointed as deputy managers, and Deng Yiyuan and Qiu Xiaopei were appointed as assistant managers. Preparations are currently underway and it is expected that the society's business will be prosperous.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Proclamation</p>
<p>It is noted that our country traditionally values thrift and emphasizes savings, possessing the virtue of "wealth hidden among the people" and "cultivating the national foundation." However, this has not been properly channeled. In order to adapt to the current financial situation, encourage national savings, utilize idle funds, and develop legitimate enterprises, the Ministry of Finance has, after consultation, taken over the Central Savings Society that existed before the incident. With the approval of the National Government, the Central Reserve Bank has appropriated funds to establish a new Central Savings Society, inheriting its assets and liabilities, and encouraging general public savings. Original depositors of the old Central Savings Society before the incident may continue their rights and interests after completing legal procedures. At the same time, the Central Savings Society will plan to issue economic recovery lottery tickets, special installment savings, and prize-bearing principal-returning savings bonds, so as to encourage the public's interest in savings, make the Central Savings business more developed, utilize idle funds, thus strengthen society, revive the economy, and benefit people's livelihoods in many ways. Apart from the Articles of Association of the Central Savings Society and the Regulations of the Supervisory Committee of the Central Savings Society being submitted to the Executive Yuan for forwarding to the National Government for examination and record and distributed, this proclamation is hereby issued for general knowledge. March 11, 32nd year of the Republic of China, Minister Zhou Fo Hai.</p>
<p>Finance Minister's Speech</p>
<p>Our country has always valued thrift and savings, and its virtues have always been in line with others. Unfortunately, the use of savings has not been flexible, and hoarding often leads to stagnation. In recent years, the situation has deteriorated, and this virtue has gradually declined. The meaning of cultivating the national foundation has not been properly channeled. The Minister has taken this into consideration and has, after consultation, taken over the original Central Savings Society before the incident. With the approval of the government, the Central Reserve Bank has appropriated funds to establish a new Central Savings Society, inheriting its assets and liabilities and opening for business on a scheduled date. The general public has a place to rely on. Depositors of the old Central Savings Society before the incident may continue their rights and interests after completing legal procedures. At the same time, the Central Savings Society will stipulate the issuance of other lottery tickets and actively promote economic recovery lottery tickets, special installment savings bonds, prize-bearing principal-returning savings bonds, etc., which are all under planning. Efforts will be made to encourage the public's interest in savings, and idle funds can also be utilized. Then, a balanced and prosperous life, a healthy society, economic recovery, and the benefit of people's livelihood will be achieved in one fell swoop. It is expected that the public will be fully aware of the government's emphasis on thrift and promotion of savings, based on their patriotism and self-love, to save money for themselves and save for the country, forming a trend and guiding social welfare.</p>
<p>Central Savings Society Articles of Association</p>
<p>Article 1: In order to promote the concept of national savings, the Central Reserve Bank, with the special permission of the Ministry of Finance, establishes the Central Savings Society to handle savings deposits with monthly draws, prizes, principal repayment, and interest payment, as well as various savings matters entrusted by the government.

<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Organizing a National Chamber of Commerce Control Association</h3>
<p>In order to establish a wartime economic system, implement controlled materials, and centralize management, the National Government is planning to establish a National Chamber of Commerce Control Association. The provisional regulations have been passed by the National Defense Conference. On the other hand, because friendly countries are implementing new policies towards [blank space] after the National Government's entry into the war, they are returning the authority to manage controlled materials to the National Government, which is a matter of great satisfaction as it facilitates the establishment of this new institution. The association held its first preparatory meeting yesterday, with organizers including leaders from the financial industry, yarn industry, department store industry, chemical industry, tobacco industry, etc., centered on representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Looking at the list of people, they are all outstanding talents of the time. The association is scheduled to draft rules and regulations today, and will specifically decide everything in the second preparatory meeting tomorrow. The people are hoping for the emergence of a powerful institution that can stabilize people's livelihoods, just like waiting for clouds in a great drought. It is particularly gratifying that the authorities can concentrate outstanding talents from the private sector for the personnel of this institution, and completely consider the future of the enterprise. At the beginning of its establishment, I would like to offer the following humble suggestions:</p>
<p>(1) Since it is a national institution, the general association should recruit reputable, talented, fair, and honest people from all over the country. Local branches should recruit first-class talents from their respective regions.</p>
<p>(2) The choice of the president of the board of directors should be carefully weighed, with a socially recognized fair person being the best choice.</p>
<p>(3) All rules and regulations must be carefully drafted to take into account the interests of the country and the convenience of merchants and people.</p>
<p>(4) Except for matters that need to be kept confidential, the association's affairs should be absolutely open, accept criticism, and gain the trust of a wide range of people, and automatically cooperate.</p>
<p>(5) The advantages of the previous controlled management by friendly countries should be retained and adopted as much as possible, and the disadvantages should of course be eliminated, in order to achieve perfection.</p>
<p>The above are just general principles, and it is firmly believed that the new institution will be able to achieve them. Secondly, in terms of industry, its importance is no less than that of commerce. It is hoped that in the near future, there will also be an institution with the same nature and national unity, to complete the entire wartime economic system.</p>
<h3>Flour for Sale Today in the West Shanghai District, Household Rice to be Sold Next Week</h3>
<p>The sixth installment of household rice in the West Shanghai District has been delayed until now due to insufficient delivery procedures. According to the Shenwen News Agency reporter's inquiry with the West Shanghai District Public Food Distribution Office, yesterday (the 11th), the office received over a thousand bags of rice from the West Shanghai Warehouse. The remaining four thousand bags are expected to be delivered within the next few days. It is estimated that distribution and sale can begin in about three or four days. It was also reported that all 15,282 bags of the third installment of household flour in the West Shanghai District were delivered yesterday (the 11th), and it is scheduled to be sold simultaneously by 55 retailers in the first and second lanes of the district starting at 9:00 AM today. At that time, residents of the two lanes can purchase 2.6 catties of flour per person with a certificate from designated retailers at a price of 5.23 yuan.</p>
<h3>Deadline to Submit Civil Service Qualification Review Documents Extended to the End of April</h3>
<p>The city's courts have been ordered to handle civil service qualification review matters and have already submitted the cases for review. The Judicial Administration Department has issued a further order to each court to submit all required documents for civil service qualification review cases by the end of April this year. Failure to do so by the deadline will result in the cases being considered incomplete. All courts are required to strictly comply with this order.</p>
<h3>Secondary School Students' Speech Contest on War Participation Rescheduled to Next Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the China-Japan Cultural Association is preparing to hold a city-wide speech contest for secondary school students on war participation. Originally scheduled for the end of this month, the association has rescheduled the contest to 2:00 PM on Saturday, April 3, at the YMCA of the Eight Immortals Bridge in the French Concession.

<h3>Flour Allocation for Noodle Products Industry Under Overall Planning</h3>
<p>Regarding the resumption of flour allocation for the noodle products industry, after the Noodle Association and the Bun and Steamed Bread Association petitioned the Public Works Department, the Public Works Department's Associations Section ordered the relevant industries to jointly organize a unit in order to comprehensively plan the flour allocation method and maintain the livelihood of the industry's workers.</p>
<h3>Partial Free Trade of Coarse Grains: Chinese Merchants Still Studying Profits</h3>
<p>According to Yang Heqing of the Coarse Grains Allocation Group, in a conversation with a Shenwen News Agency reporter, since the war, the purchase of coarse grains in the city has been handled by the Military Allocation Bureau. This time, the ability to freely trade is due to the industry's special request to the Military Allocation authorities in order to maintain their livelihood. The regulations for yellow beans, sesame seeds, raw kernels, cottonseed, and rapeseed are that 75% of the local coarse grain quantity will be purchased and allocated by the Military Allocation authorities at a predetermined price, and the remaining 25% can be freely traded by the industry. Other items such as corn, broad beans, and red sorghum are stipulated to be 50%, with the remainder being freely traded by the industry. This method is implemented equally for both Chinese and Japanese merchants. Currently, Japanese merchants are already engaging in free trade transactions, while Chinese merchants are still reluctant to engage in free trade because they have not accurately estimated the amount of profit they can obtain.</p>
<h3>A Record of What I Saw and Heard in Zhenhai and Zhoushan Island</h3>
<p>Zhenhai, Ningbo, Zhoushan Island, and other places are China's gateways facing the East China Sea. Now, they possess a renewed character, and their importance increases day by day. Especially for Shanghai, they are vital, and Shanghai's lifeline depends on their maintenance. The materials that Shanghai desires from the mainland are all transported through the aforementioned ports and islands, relying on countless sailboats that cross the East China Sea from the mainland. Zhenhai and Zhoushan Island are also the base for China's coastal blockade line, and they also contain inexhaustible, largest fishing grounds. Because of such value, they are in an inseparable relationship with Shanghai. The renewed character and importance that I want to talk about lie here. However, people in Shanghai do not value this point. With the cooperation of the Fleet Reporting Department and the local garrison of naval and telecommunications forces, I undertook a short trip, and the actual observations and hearings I obtained are as follows:</p>
<p>Zhenhai</p>
<p>In August of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937, or Showa 13), the Japanese Fleet stationed in China issued a decisive declaration to blockade China's coastal navigation, cutting off the sea route to Chongqing. However, Chongqing still maintained routes through Guangdong, Vietnam, Burma, and the so-called Ningbo route from Zhenhai. Subsequently, the routes through Guangdong, Vietnam, and Burma were successively cut off by the Japanese forces. Only one Zhejiang-Jiangxi route connecting Zhenhai and Ningbo remained. Because of its large transportation capacity, it became Chongqing's only smuggling route. Thus, sailboats and large foreign ships crowded in between.</p>
<p>All weapons and ammunition from this port island could directly cultivate the fighting power of the Third War Area. At the same time, it nourished Chongqing's lifeline from the sea. Under such circumstances, the Japanese army naturally could not remain silent. The naval landing forces occupied Zhenhai on July 16th of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939, or Showa 14) in a joint sea and air operation, destroying the source of its anti-Japanese war blood transfusion route. After achieving its mission, it withdrew automatically. Who knew that after the Japanese army withdrew, this secret route would be reactivated. Therefore, the Japanese army reoccupied the area on April 19th of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941, or Showa 16), and then bypassed the Yong River, about eight or nine li away from the area, occupied Ningbo, and completely brought the starting point of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line under control. Therefore, after the area was occupied by the Japanese army, it had a great impact on Shanghai's financial circles. At the same time, the Blue Shirts Society dispatched by Chongqing to Shanghai, as well as special forces disrupting the rear, originally used the area as a round-trip route. Its fall made it impossible for Chongqing to carry out espionage work against Shanghai.</p>
<p>Zhoushan Island</p>
<p>Zhoushan Island has close geographical ties with Zhenhai and Ningbo. It is a well-known trading port and was captured by the Japanese naval landing forces on June 23rd of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939, or Showa 14). The nature of Zhoushan Island is more of a distribution center for materials, and even more so, it is a famous fishing ground. The greatest purpose of the Japanese navy's occupation of the area was to blockade the East China Sea. Moreover, Daishan Island, north of Zhoushan Island, produces three million catties of salt annually. Putuo Mountain, east of Zhoushan Island, along with Wutai Mountain in Shanxi and Emei Mountain in Sichuan, is one of China's three major Buddhist sites and is historically famous. In the past, transportation between Japan and China had to go through Dinghai on Zhoushan Island. Therefore, it is also a place of general concern in history.</p>
<p>The island is juxtaposed with Dinghai. Shenjiamen, located on Lujia Island in the east of the island, is a distribution center for nearby fisheries, and its commerce is more active than the county seat of Dinghai. Even in terms of the import and export of aid-to-Chiang materials, its importance is far above Dinghai. The island was long coveted by Britain and France, who wanted to use it as a base for aggression. During the Opium War in 1840, British General Pulima led 26 warships to attack and occupy Dinghai in June of that year, and then attacked Zhapu Port, blockading Ningbo. Before Shanghai's prosperity, Britain had attempted to make Zhoushan Island a second Hong Kong. From Shanghai to Dinghai, the distance is 132 nautical miles. If going from Ningbo, it is only 35 nautical miles. The island's products are weak, and the supply of rice is insufficient, with about three-quarters being supplied from Shanghai. Before the Japanese army occupied it, the island and Zhenhai were both entrepots for Chongqing's entry and exit, which was also the hub of the aid-to-Chiang route. However, since the Japanese army occupied the two places, they only have the value of blockade bases. As for politics and economics, they do not have any important missions.</p>
<p>Security and Administration</p>
<p>Zhenhai and Zhoushan Island are both governed by the Autonomous Committees, which are responsible to the Japanese Navy, no different from places that are absolutely dependent on the Navy. However, upon closer inspection, there are two differences. In Zhenhai, in addition to the county seat, the army also cooperates in guarding the area. However, Zhoushan Island and other nearby islands are completely guided by the navy. Since March 1st of this year, Zhenhai County has been directly under the jurisdiction of the Zhejiang East Administrative Office of the National Government. Therefore, the "Zhenhai Autonomous Committee" was dissolved at that time, and the former president was reassigned as the county magistrate. However, Zhoushan Island is still under the sole administration of the "Dinghai Autonomous Committee." The change of Zhenhai to the jurisdiction of the Zhejiang East Administrative Office is undoubtedly due to the Japanese side's construction spirit, and in substance, it is no different from before.</p>
<p>The Zhenhai administrative region has a total of seven districts. The security of the first, second, third, and fourth districts has been consolidated. As for the fifth, sixth, and seventh districts, bandits still appear from time to time, and they have not yet escaped the era of sweeping away bandits. The bandits who appear in the area call themselves the "Jiangbei Guerrilla Team," but in reality, they are all vagrant bandits with no ideological organization whatsoever. Thoroughly sweeping them away is only a matter of time. The population increases by 200 to 300 people every month, totaling about 17,000 people. Soon, it will be able to restore the pre-war population of 20,000 people. At present, it has generally restored its former prosperity.</p>
<p>The Autonomous Committee on Zhoushan Island has 15 branches on the island, Daishan Island, and other islands. Under a unified organization, the archipelago has a total population of about 500,000 people. There are no fewer than six or seven hundred islands, large and small, and the security is very good, with almost no room for vagrant bandits to move around.</p>
<p>The security force of the Autonomous Committee itself has made significant progress recently. In addition to about 1,300 police officers, there is also a military police force of about 100 people responsible for maintaining security. At the end of last year, the Wang Jineng unit of Chongqing was dedicated to He Yun on Liuheng Island and has been reorganized into a security team to help maintain security. At the same time, the self-defense organization of the people is also working hard. Like Zhenhai, they have organized a self-defense corps and implemented the Baojia system, with good results. From a geographical point of view, the focus of the security problem in the area is at sea. However, because of the recent close transportation with the mainland production areas, it is feared that it will cause the rampant pirates of the early days, so the Japanese naval garrison is fully prepared to counter them.</p>
<p>Progress in Various Constructions</p>
<p>The most noteworthy construction in this area is the roads, because the stability of security and the increase in production are directly due to the construction of roads. For example, in Zhenhai, the Ningbo-Yin Highway connecting Zhenhai and Ningbo has been built. The entire journey is about 30 kilometers and has been mostly completed. It is expected to be opened to traffic by the end of May. After the completion of this highway, it can shorten the distance between Ningbo and Zhenhai. At the same time, the economic development of the two places is also guaranteed. In addition, roads necessary for security are also being constantly built. In terms of the new bridges built by the Japanese naval forces in Zhenhai alone, there are as many as 26.</p>
<p>The construction of Zhoushan Island is even more active, especially the round-the-island road that runs through the entire island, which is even more valuable. This road started at the end of the year before last, lasted about six months, and cost more than two million yuan before it was completed, which has greatly helped to establish the security of Zhoushan Island. It is a pity that the islanders still lack a full understanding of the benefits derived from the road and the spirit of promoting construction, which is a pity. This round-the-island road, which is more than a hundred kilometers long, has become the basis for living and working in peace. At present, efforts are still being made to increase the distance in order to facilitate intermodal transportation. In addition, the salt pan security road on Daishan Island is also under construction recently. Therefore, in the future, in the development of the salt industry, it will be able to obtain unlimited results.</p>
<p>In addition to road construction, attention is also paid to education and culture. Schools, libraries, and sports fields are established. On the one hand, public utilities such as electricity and telephones are actively repaired. On the other hand, in terms of increasing production and construction, farmland is expanded, cooperatives are established, agriculture is improved, and afforestation is promoted. Awards are given for increasing production, and small loans are implemented. In particular, improving fisheries and increasing salt industry work in the Daishan Island area have increased the importance of this area. It can be determined that its future status will be important, and the relevant parties are currently studying all development plans.</p>
<p>Political Issues</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the positions of Zhenhai and Zhoushan Island are absolutely dependent on the navy. All facilities are aimed at restoring pre-war prosperity. Now, due to the geographical distance between the two places, the relationship with the National Government is extremely shallow. The National Government does not have any direct guidance or policies to implement in these two places. Therefore, the people in both places feel that if they change their affiliation to the National Government, the established policies of the past may change. At the same time, there are many other reasons, so there are inevitable doubts. The Japanese naval authorities responsible for that area, in order to avoid increasing the burden on the National Government, firmly adhere to the policy of enriching the local economy. In other words, before achieving economic self-sufficiency, they decided to promote all construction and strive to produce to supply the needs of Shanghai.

<h3>Chief Controller Inagaki of the Public Works Bureau Talks About the Current Status of Oil Rationing: Actively Negotiating Quantity and Types; Residents Eagerly Await Implementation</h3>
<p>In order to maintain the supply of major food grains, the concession authorities have determined the method of rationing rice, grains, and sugar in the city based on population. The handling agencies of the authorities have successively issued purchase certificates. After receiving the certificates, citizens can use the certificates to purchase the required household rice and sugar from the designated retailers. As for the supply of edible oil in the city, the demand from citizens is very high. The concession authorities have long determined the principle of rationing oil in the city based on population and have issued oil purchase certificates within the concession to facilitate citizens to purchase with the certificates. However, the date of sale of household edible oil has not been announced, and citizens are eagerly awaiting it.</p>
<p>The Transfer Procedures Are Very Cumbersome</p>
<p>In order to clarify the actual details, the Shenwen News reporter visited Mr. Inagaki, Chief Controller of Materials of the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession on the morning of the 11th. He was received and answered the reporter's inquiries. He explained the issue of rationing oil in the city in great detail. The record of the conversation is as follows: (1) Question: Residents of the city have a high demand for edible oil. The concession authorities have long determined the principle of rationing oil based on population and have issued some purchase certificates. However, I do not know when it will be implemented and what the detailed method is. (1) Answer: The Public Works Bureau does not distribute the major food grains within the concession according to the Baojia system. The Baojia system is only used as a reference for implementing distribution. For the distribution of edible oil, the authorities also implement it according to the method of rice and grain distribution. For the distribution of various small daily necessities, it seems more appropriate to implement distribution according to the Baojia system. However, edible oil is different from this. The edible oil in the city is transported from North China and Manchuria. The transfer procedures and the quantity of supply are not as simple as the distribution of sugar. Especially in terms of quantity, it is necessary to consider it for a long time in order to seek a constant period of supply without fear of interruption. Therefore, the authorities have been actively negotiating with the Japanese Embassy on the issue of the type of oil to be sold and the quantity of supply. The specific method of rationing oil based on population will be clarified by April 15th at the latest.</p>
<p>The Future Selling Price Will Be Carefully Verified</p>
<p>(2) Question: Is the scope of rationing oil based on population in the city limited to the two concessions, or is it universally implemented in the central city, West Shanghai, Zhabei, Pudong, and the South City districts? (2) Answer: The rationing of oil based on population handled by the Materials Control Department of the Public Works Bureau is only within the two concessions. Other districts are handled by the authorities in charge. (3) Question: When the method of rationing oil based on population is implemented, can you tell me how much each person can be allocated per month? (3) Answer: The authorities have prepared everything for rationing oil based on population within the concession. However, the issue of the quantity of supply is still being negotiated with the relevant parties. Therefore, it has not yet been determined how much edible oil each person will be allocated per month. (4) Question: Will the retail price change when edible oil is rationed based on population? (4) Answer: When this bureau handles the rationing of edible oil based on population, it will be calculated based on the total cost. The selling price should be lower than the current price.</p>

<h3>The 29th Period of Food Ration Distribution; Sugar Was Rationed Yesterday; Those Who Have Moved Are Allowed to Use the Purchase Certificates They Have Already Received</h3>
<p>After the authorities implemented the system of rationing food based on population to maintain the food supply for Shanghai citizens, the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession, the Public Works Bureau of the French Concession, and the Municipal Food Administration issued purchase certificates for rice, flour, grains, edible oil, and sugar, and stipulated methods of rationing based on population. The certificates are used to purchase from designated retailers on a periodic basis. It is reported that the first period of sugar and the 20th period of household rations have been sold with certificates starting yesterday. The distribution period for edible oil and grains will be announced by the authorities after a decision is made.</p>
<p>Sugar Sales</p>
<p>Sugar merchants cooperate. With the approval of the military distribution authorities, sugar rationing has been implemented simultaneously in the city's public and community spheres (including Hongkou), the French Concession, the South City, West Shanghai, Zhabei, the central city area, and Pudong, starting yesterday. Purchase certificates issued by the competent authorities of each area are used to purchase from designated Class A retailers. Each certificate is for half a catty per person, and the price is 2 yuan and 35 cents. The validity period of the first period of sugar certificates is until March 31st. If it expires, it will be invalid and cannot be reissued. As for the second period of sugar certificates, it will be distributed at that time. The quantity, price, start and end dates of the distribution will be announced by the cooperative on April 1st.</p>
<p>Unqualified Sugar Merchants Are All Cancelled</p>
<p>The cooperative has re-registered and merged the Class A retailers who sell household sugar. Those who have passed the review will be given a registration number, and unqualified households will be canceled. The following methods are stipulated: (1) Unqualified households should stop collecting payments immediately if they have not paid the payment; (2) Unqualified households should stop delivering goods immediately if they have paid the payment but have not delivered the goods, and the payment should be returned; (3) Unqualified households should immediately report to the place where the goods have been sent; (4) The cooperative will provide subsidies for the quota of the unqualified households that should have been distributed in February to show consideration.</p>
<p>New Retailers Will Be Implemented in the Second Period</p>
<p>The cooperative has merged more than 1,000 Class A retailers in the city's seven areas into 138 in the Public Concession, 111 in the French Concession, 61 in the South City, and 65 each in West Shanghai and Zhabei. Each store is issued a registration number and ordered to hang it in a conspicuous place for identification. It is reported that it has been decided to implement it starting from the second period. Therefore, the distribution of the second period of sugar certificates will be based on the newly compiled retailer number. As for the first period of sugar certificates, it will be sold temporarily according to the old registration number.</p>
<p>Types of Rice and Flour</p>
<p>Regarding the 29th period of household rations, after the Public Works Bureau and the Public Works Bureau of the French Concession stipulated it, it has been sold with rice purchase certificates and flour certificates by the rice stores established in the two concessions since yesterday. Each certificate can purchase one and a half liters of whole rice and one liter of broken rice, and the price is 6 yuan and 30 cents. 1.8 catties of No. 2 flour and 0.4 catties of No. 3 flour cost a total of 3 yuan and 85 cents. However, most of the whole rice in this period is domestic white rice and foreign rice. The number of brown rice is not large, so brown rice is not distributed in some rice stores. The 30th period of household rations is scheduled to be collected on the 15th of this month and sold starting on the 21st. The quantity and matching will be determined by the authorities.</p>
<p>Edible Oil Rationing Is In Great Demand</p>
<p>After the Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office was approved to ration oil based on population, the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession, the Public Works Bureau of the French Concession, and the Municipal Food Administration issued edible oil certificates. It is reported that the military distribution authorities have purchased soybean oil from oil factories in Shanghai and soybean oil that arrived in Shanghai from Dalian, which will be distributed to the wholesale office and distributed to designated edible oil retailers for rationing based on population. As for the date and price of purchase with certificates, it will be announced by the wholesale office in conjunction with the authorities. All those who hold edible oil certificates are requested to purchase according to the methods stipulated by the wholesale office at that time.</p>
<p>The Same Rice Store Also Sells Grains</p>
<p>After the Public Works Bureau and the Public Works Bureau of the French Concession issued the first period of grain certificates, they have designated each established rice store to also distribute grains. Therefore, the rice store registration number on the grain certificates issued to taxpayers in the concession is exactly the same as the rice purchase certificate and flour certificate. It is reported that the grains issued in the first period are soybeans and the like, which will be collected with the 30th period of household rations. The name, quantity, and price of the grains will be announced at that time. It is expected that each established rice store will be clear when receiving the 30th period of purchase orders.</p>
<p>Those Who Have Moved This Month Are Allowed to Use the Original Purchase Certificates</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of grain distribution for those who have moved, according to the Datong News Agency reporter, the food management authorities have stipulated the following methods in order to avoid losses to those who have moved: Those who have moved within the scope of each district in Shanghai, if they have not received the grain purchase certificate for this month in the new location, they will still be allowed to use the grain purchase certificate for this month issued in the original location. This type of grain purchase certificate includes certificates for rice, flour, grains, sugar, oil, and other items. As for the second landlord who deducts grain purchase certificates to operate privately when sub-households move during the certificate issuance period, the authorities will allow the sub-households to report. The reporting location is the police station in the district or the place where rice purchase certificates are issued in the district. Once it is found that it is true, the authorities will severely punish the private operator.</p>
<h3>Two Transportation Companies Are Conducting Wuhan Shipping</h3>
<p>According to sources in the shipping industry, the Shanghai Inland River Steamship Company and the Huazhong Steamship Company of this port are currently conducting inland river shipping matters in Wuhan. According to the Wuhan inland river shipping, the previous ship problem has led to stagnation. The above-mentioned two wheel companies are merged Wuhan's shipping company, and supplemented and reorganized.</p>
<h3>Two Criminals Confess to Strangling a British Man</h3>
<p>Walter Bloom, a British man who was in charge of the boiler room of the Yangshupu Road Power Plant, had been working in the factory for more than 19 years. He was 51 years old and lived at No. 349 Grant Road. After his old wife died, he had no children. He lived alone in his twilight years. Unexpectedly, at 9:30 pm on the 23rd of last month, he was attacked in the dark and remote area of ​​Guiyang Road and Haizhou Road by two hooligans from Jiangbei, Lu Linggui and Liang Yuanxiang, who made a living by robbery. At that time, they rushed up from behind with a belt, put the belt around his neck, dragged him to the edge of the field, tightened the belt, and tied a knot. Mr. Hua died after a short time. He only had 35 savings coins and 2 military tickets in his wallet. The two hooligans stripped off the wool coat, work clothes, and pants he was wearing and escaped. They pawned the coat at the Rongchang Pawnshop on Yangshupu Road and divided the money. After the case occurred, Detective Ji Xiucheng of the Yangshupu Road Police Station arrested Lu Linggui in Tengyue Road based on a secret tip. The man was bold and reckless. After committing this murder for money, he was still standing there as a self-defense corps. He confessed his accomplice Liang Wuxiang, who was a garbage collector, hiding in Yong'an Road, Pudong. The police rushed to the area and continued to arrest him. He fully admitted to the police station that there was no third accomplice. He was once escorted to the court to apply for detention. Yesterday morning, the case was tried in the third criminal court. The lawyer representing the Legal Department of the Police Station filed a lawsuit for robbery and murder. The sentencing is scheduled for the morning of the 17th of this month.</p>
<h3>Baojia Offices Established in Nanshi and West Shanghai; Nanshi Is a Model Baojia District</h3>
<p>After the Municipal Government Baojia Committee officially announced its establishment, the director of the committee, Mr. Jing, believed that the population in Nanshi and West Shanghai was large and complex. In addition to Nanshi District being designated as a model Baojia district, the Baojia compilation should be meticulous. The entire West Shanghai area should also be thoroughly rectified. In order to make it easier for the Baojia in the two districts to manage and command, district offices were specially established in the two districts. The organization of the district offices is the same as the headquarters, but on a smaller scale.</p>
<h3>West Shanghai Tests Police Bells</h3>
<p>The director of the West Shanghai Baojia Office is still being carefully selected. In Nanshi, Zhan Xiyu, the Baojia administrator of the police station, has been promoted. The official appointment has been announced. It is reported that one to three consulting committee members will be set up under the district office to assist in promoting the Baojia facilities in the district. The West Shanghai Baozhong Steering Committee decided to convene a general committee meeting at the general office of the committee on Yuyuan Road at 2:00 pm today in order to promote security in the district, strengthen the Baojia organization, and discuss various Baojia affairs in the district. At that time, Pan Da, director of the West Shanghai Police Department, Director Bu Lifu, Director Ding Yutang, and all members of the committee will attend and participate to discuss the adjustment of Baojia funds, the investigation and compilation of household registration, the re-investigation, and important cases such as patrol teams in the district. Also, at 3:00 pm yesterday, the police bells in West Shanghai rang. The area around Yuyuan Road Bailinan Nickel was immediately sealed off, and it was opened around 4:00 pm. It is reported that the Baojia authorities tested the police bells installed in each area in order to avoid damage to the police bell mechanism after a long time, so as to detect it in advance and quickly repair it. Therefore, a special commissioner conducted a test of the police bells in the first block yesterday. This will also be held in the second and third blocks after 2:00 pm this afternoon and tomorrow.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Police Department Issued Residence Permits, Extended to the End of This Month; The District Police Department Extended to the End of June; The Price of Taking Photos for Certificates Remains the Same</h3>
<p>In order to ensure local security in the city, the Municipal Police Department was ordered to issue residence permits. Since the beginning, citizens who applied for them have been extremely crowded, resulting in the original deadline not being completed as scheduled. According to the Central News Agency reporter, the Municipal Police Department has now been ordered to extend the deadline. The police stations in the city will be extended to the end of this month, while the police stations in each district will be extended to the end of June this year. The deadline will not be extended again at the deadline. Those who have not yet received their residence permits should apply immediately and do not wait and see. At the same time, the police department has long stipulated that the price of taking photos for residence permits in photography studios in each district is 2 yuan and 50 cents. The photos are still taken according to this price limit. Photography studios and others must not exceed it. If they dare to violate it, the respective branches in charge will be ordered to effectively crack down on it.</p>
<h3>Paper Mill Joint Sales Office Established; Unified Paper Distribution</h3>
<p>The Chinese Paper Mill Industry Association of this city has been formally established in response to environmental needs. In order to coordinate and suppress the price of paper, the association has submitted an application to the authorities to establish a joint sales office for Chinese paper mills. The paper produced by each factory will be distributed and allocated to each paper shop by the office. It will also establish close contact with Japanese paper mills to achieve unification. The office has been formally established and has set up an office in the Shanghai Industrial Building on Huainan Road to start operations.</p>
<h3>Huazhong Match Company Will Distribute Matches Within a Month</h3>
<p>The Huazhong Match Company, which has been prepared, has chosen No. 88 Bowuyuan Road as its business location and will start operations in the second half of this month. The match distribution in this port will also be handled by the company.</p>
<h3>Pretending to Be Sick to Avoid Self-Defense Service; Baojia Heads Are Jointly Punished; Punished for Collusion, Deception, and Concealment</h3>
<p>In each Baojia district of the Public Concession, men who are under 45 years old and over 20 years old are obliged to serve in the self-defense corps. However, according to the Datong News Agency, male residents who have special diseases (such as mental illness or other incurable diseases) are allowed to be exempted. However, if it is found that someone has falsely reported that they have obscure diseases such as pulmonary tuberculosis and are actually healthy, in addition to severely punishing the false reporter, the Baojia head who colluded with them to deceive the superiors will also be punished for collusion, deception, and concealment.</p>
<h3>Wu Ding Road Soup Kitchen - Soup Distribution Has Not Been Interrupted</h3>
<p>Yesterday, we received a letter from the Social Welfare Bureau stating, "Regarding the Bureau's order to take over the Shanghai Branch of the Relief Committee, personnel were dispatched on March 1st to take over the case. The winter disaster relief soup kitchen operated by the committee at 220 Wu Ding Road was also taken over on that day, with Deng Fuchu in charge. Soup distribution is vital to the lives of the poor, so there has not been a single day of interruption before or after the takeover. The news in your newspaper on March 9th about the Wu Ding Road soup kitchen stating that it 'was suspended for several days' is slightly inaccurate. This is to inform you and request verification and correction."</p>
<h3>Manure Carts Arbitrarily Parked in Lanes - Strict Punishment Will Be Enforced - Designated Parking Areas Exist</h3>
<p>The sanitation workers of the French Concession treat the Public Works Department's manure carts as their private property. After emptying the chamber pots in the morning, the sanitation workers simply take the manure carts back with them, parking them outside their doors like private cars. These large manure carts occupy a quarter of the lane's width, obstructing traffic. Pedestrians often collide with them at night. The stench is overwhelming during the day, and flies swarm in the summer, which is detrimental to hygiene. Now, the authorities, aware of this situation, believe that these sanitation workers are cunning and slippery. Because the authorities originally designated areas for centralized parking of manure carts, in the future, if this is discovered again, the manure cart number will be recorded, and strict punishment will be enforced.</p>
<h3>Supply of Major Goods in Central China - Specific Plans to be Developed - Comprehensive Price Controls Based on New Strategies</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's report from a Shanghai-based reporter to authoritative sources, the authorities of both concessions, in order to thoroughly regulate prices and ensure adequate distribution of major goods, have achieved close cooperation with Chinese and Japanese authorities and have decided to formulate specific measures. The scope of these measures will cover the entire Central China region, but the initial focus will be on assisting production and managing consumption, so that production and consumption can be balanced.</p>
<p>Management Strategies</p>
<p>The authorities, in order to strictly supervise merchants' buying and selling and guide the market towards the right track, have decided to manage overall prices according to new strategies to address: (1) Retail merchants in various industries who violate regulations on selling prices, or change the grade of goods, sell inferior goods, or engage in any other misconduct; (2) Shops and firms that need to change selling prices due to cost factors can submit reasons to the authorities through their industry association and request a price change; otherwise, it will be considered illegal.</p>
<p>Buyer and Seller Guidelines</p>
<p>Wholesale and retail merchants of major commodities must join their respective trade associations as members in accordance with regulations. Non-members of trade associations may not engage in the buying and selling of these commodities in any way. However, wholesalers of these commodities must report the quantity of goods sold, the quantity in stock, the storage location, and the cost price to the trade association on a regular basis. The trade association will then report this information to the relevant authorities for their reference. Those who refuse to comply or underreport or overreport will be prosecuted in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Penalties for Violations</p>
<p>The authorities' penalty measures for shops that violate regulations are extremely strict. Once a violation is discovered and verified, penalties will be imposed in accordance with regulations without leniency. If the violation involves (1) raising prices, falsely claiming to be out of stock, refusing to sell, or changing the grade of goods with the intention to deceive, in addition to revoking the business license, a fine of between 500 and 5,000 yuan will be imposed; (2) If prices are not marked, or secret codes are used, a fine of between 300 and 3,000 yuan will be imposed.</p>
<h3>Trade Associations Will Be Banned if They Are Not Approved</h3>
<p>The central government has long had laws and regulations regarding the organization of trade associations. Recently, many industries in this city have organized associations without prior approval, which is inconsistent with central government regulations. It is now heard that the Municipal Economic Bureau, in order to effectively rectify the situation, will strictly ban the above-mentioned illegal associations in accordance with central government regulations, starting immediately.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Industry and Commerce Investigation Institute Begins Work</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Industry and Commerce Investigation Institute, jointly organized by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Manufacturers Association, is headed by Tian Heqing from the industrial sector. The investigation personnel are appointed by the two associations. According to the institute, the investigation work was originally scheduled to begin on the 8th of this month, but has been postponed to this week due to procedural reasons. The scope of the investigation will initially focus on aspects such as the control of various new companies.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Publishes Compilation of Laws and Regulations</h3>
<p>The municipal government has hundreds of various laws and regulations. The compilation section of the fifth department of the municipal government has completed the collection and compilation of these laws and regulations and has had them printed and published in two volumes, bound in Western style, which are exquisite and beautiful. The content is comprehensive and can be used for reference. If needed, they can be obtained at a price.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Actively Prepares for Epidemic Prevention</h3>
<p>The Nanshi District Health Office of the Municipal Health Bureau, recognizing that early detection is the most important factor in preventing epidemics, has informed all public and private hospitals and clinics in the Nanshi District that if they diagnose patients with infectious diseases, they must report all detailed diagnostic information to the office in accordance with the hospital management regulations and the provisional regulations for physicians, in order to understand the state of the outbreak and develop appropriate countermeasures.</p>

<h3>A Complete Picture of French Indochina</h3>
<p>- By A Vietnamese</p>
<p>(I) Overview of Vietnamese Geography</p>
<p>Vietnam, also known as Annam, is called "Indochina" by Europeans and Americans. It is located in the eastern part of the Indochina Peninsula, between 8 degrees 30 minutes and 23 degrees 20 minutes north latitude, and 100 degrees and 109 degrees 30 minutes east longitude. It borders China's Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan provinces to the north, the Gulf of Tonkin and the South China Sea to the east and southeast, and Myanmar and Thailand to the west. Its area is 737,000 square kilometers, which is 1.3 times the size of France itself, twice the size of Japan's Honshu, and seven times the size of China's Zhejiang Province.</p>
<p>Within Vietnam, the Annam Mountains run diagonally, which is the remaining range of China's Yunling Mountains. There are two large plains in the north and south. The northern one is the Red River Delta, called the Tonkin Plain; the southern one is the Mekong River Delta, called the Cochinchina Plain. Both are very fertile and constitute Vietnam's beautiful agricultural country. The Red River and the Mekong River are the largest rivers, both originating in China. The Red River is the Yuan River, also known as the Fuliang River, flowing from Yunnan to the southeast into Vietnam and emptying into the Gulf of Tonkin. The Mekong River is the Lancang River, flowing from Yunnan to the south, passing through Myanmar and Thailand, entering Vietnam, and emptying into the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Vietnam's coastline is mostly straight. The east faces the South China Sea, and the southwest and the Malay Peninsula enclose the Gulf of Siam. The northeast and China's Hainan Island and the Leizhou Peninsula enclose the Gulf of Tonkin. Important ports include: one is Fanglan Bay on the southeast coast, which was controlled by Japan for landing before the Pacific War; two is Saigon, which has long been the base of the French Far East Fleet and is also a major commercial port, ranking first in Vietnam in commerce and being the capital of Indochina; three is Tourane, also known as Hoi An, south of Hue, the old capital of Vietnam, also a famous good port; and four is Haiphong, a good port along the Gulf of Tonkin, but it has always been more famous as a commercial port.</p>
<p>The climate is warm and rainy because it is located in the tropics, creating excellent conditions for agricultural development. However, the northern highlands are cooler in winter, just like the southern parts of Guangxi and Yunnan in China. The year can be divided into dry and wet seasons. The wet season is from April to October, and the dry season is from November to March of the following year. However, monsoons often cause dangerous irregularities in rainfall. Many rivers expand strongly during the monsoon rain season, becoming powerful sources of irrigation and hydroelectric power.</p>
<p>Except for the high mountain areas, it is a fertile breeding ground for tropical plants. The mountains and plains are covered with strange forests, including very valuable trees. But large areas are unhealthy swampy jungles prone to epidemics.</p>
<p>Hanoi is the capital of French Vietnam and the capital of Tonkin Province. The French-appointed governor-general is stationed here, governing the entire territory. The urban area is on the right bank of the Red River and is the center of railways and highways. Trade is quite prosperous. Especially after the July 7th Incident, before the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was cut off, its prosperity was envied. Other famous large cities include Haiphong, Saigon, Cholon, Hue, and Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, also known as Jinbiancheng.</p>
<p>Vietnam's population is not large. According to a 1936 survey, it was more than 23 million people, that is, 31.1 people per square kilometer. The distribution of the population is listed in the table below:</p>
<p>(Based on Yoshitaka Wada's "New Knowledge of Western Oceans")</p>
<p>The trend of population development can be seen in the table below:</p>
<p>(Based on the 1943 Allied Press "Where is the World Going?")</p>
<p>Among the residents of Vietnam, the majority are Annamese, belonging to the Mongolian race. Because they have been influenced by Chinese culture for a long time, their customs are also the same. There are also many mixed-race people of Han Chinese and Annamese descent. Due to this situation, when we arrive in Vietnam, it is still the same as in our own country. Although the various major cities already have European-style constructions by the French, they still retain the streets that the Chinese have painstakingly managed, and the various industries of industry, commerce, agriculture, and mining. The clothing, food, housing, and transportation of the Annamese people are indistinguishable from those of our overseas Chinese. The ethnic distribution of the population in Vietnam is shown in the following table.</p>
<p>(Based on the 1936 National Census)</p>
<p>Race Population (in thousands) (%)</p>
<p>Annamese 16,679 72.4</p>
<p>Cambodian 1,925 8.4</p>
<p>Thai 1,375 6.0</p>
<p>Indonesian 1,017 4.4</p>
<p>Other natives 659 2.9</p>
<p>Total indigenous peoples 22,655 98.4</p>
<p>Chinese (Rice) 326 1.4</p>
<p>French 39 0.2</p>
<p>Other foreigners 10 -</p>
<p>Total 23,030 100</p>
<p>(Rice) The variability of overseas Chinese is extremely large, and the increase was particularly large between 1937 and 1940. It is estimated to be over 800,000, but it has decreased sharply since the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was cut off. Mixed-race people of overseas Chinese and indigenous people are not included.</p>

<h3>New Perspectives on the Price Problem</h3>
<p>Recently, the prices of daily necessities and essential goods have been rising, almost at a thousand miles a day. This is a serious problem that cannot be ignored for a moment. How to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods? How to break the evils of hoarding and relieve the suffering of consumers? These are all urgent tasks on the road to building the economy of Central China.</p>
<p>Regarding price countermeasures, the various organs of the National Government, the Public Works Department, and the Japanese side are all working separately, racking their brains to find solutions. The people also regard it as a serious problem and are unanimously cooperating with the authorities to promote measures to suppress prices. Although they are working hard in this way, all prices are still rising sharply and are unstoppable. Ordinary means cannot stop the rise in prices of various goods. The most severe measures must be taken to solve the problem.</p>
<p>The fundamental reason for the high price of goods lies in the buying and hoarding of speculators. At the same time, the stagnation of production and the scarcity of various products, the problem of currency is only one of the reasons that stimulate buying and hoarding, but it cannot be said to be the direct cause of rising prices. There is no shortage of hoarding of various commodities in Central China. To give an example, look at cotton yarn and cotton cloth. The inventory in Central China is enough for four or five years of use. Even if production is stagnant, it will not affect the needs of the people. However, speculators are searching for and hoarding goods on the market and are unwilling to sell them, so people feel that production is stagnant and affects prices. Many people discuss price policies, but they often ignore this situation, focusing only on small problems and not seeking thorough solutions. Increasing production, implementing official prices, and cracking down on speculation are, of course, important issues, but these measures are all temporary solutions rather than fundamental ones. Now we should go a step further and consider fundamental solutions.</p>
<p>Rather than cracking down on speculation, it is better to find ways to make speculation impossible. Rather than implementing official prices, it is better to guide prices to automatically fall to official prices. This is the important thing. And the fundamental policies of cracking down on speculation and implementing official prices still exist. As long as we are willing to put in the effort to study, it is not difficult to discover the direction. For example, issuing commodity lottery tickets, buying up hoarded commodities, and selling these goods on the market at any time to absorb excess purchasing power, or transporting these goods to the interior to exchange for raw materials, or using this as a basis to establish a buying group responsible for adjusting materials and prices, this is an effective method. The problem of materials and prices now is quite serious. Clearly recognizing this problem and planning appropriate measures, we deeply feel is a major responsibility that officials and the people should bear. We earnestly appeal again to the Chinese and Japanese authorities, do not use temporary solutions, but must use fundamental and thorough policies.

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Private Economics and Public Economics of Banks</h3>
<p>Banks are company organizations. According to Article 1 of the Company Law, a company is a group established for the purpose of profit, so there is no doubt that banks are established for the purpose of profit. At the beginning of its organization, how should the establishment procedure be, how should the personnel be arranged, how should the internal equipment be, and how should the accounting system be, all of which are the most important considerations for the person in charge. After its establishment, how to attract deposits, how to operate loans, and how to handle investments are even more important for the person in charge. The purpose is nothing more than how to make a profit? How can I be responsible to the shareholders? Entrusted to operate with the shareholders' capital, in order to be worthy of the shareholders, the more profit, the better, this is the so-called private economics of banks.</p>
<p>However, banks are quasi-public utilities and should take social welfare as a prerequisite. A bank with very high profits may not be beneficial to society. For example, speculation and hoarding may be very profitable for a while, but society has been harmed invisibly. The development of beneficial industries may be slow in the short term, but the long-term benefits are very substantial. When society prospers, banks also develop accordingly, this is the so-called public economics of banks.</p>
<p>A bank that only cares about private economics and ignores public economics may have prosperous business for a while on the surface, but the future is unpredictable. If all banks, within the constraints of national law, can take care of both private economics and public economics, and obtain legitimate benefits from the development of public economics, then the foundation is solid, the effect is great, and the development of the bank itself goes without saying. Therefore, banks should respect the public interest of society and obey national policies. The so-called enriching the country and benefiting the people is the bank's bounden duty. How can it only take the interests of shareholders as its sole goal and one-sided mission.</p>
<h3>New Regulations for Loan Consolidation and Restrictions by the Central Reserve Bank</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch) The Central Reserve Bank, in order to stabilize finance and suppress rising commodity prices, has established regulations for consolidating and restricting various types of loans.

Hereafter, no new loans for these items shall be made. (3) Hereafter, those requesting mortgage loans from this bank with goods as collateral shall be limited to members of the relevant trade association who have obtained certification from the association and hold a business license issued by the local competent authority. Non-members are naturally not considered legitimate merchants in that industry and should be refused. The loan officers of this bank must investigate the assets, credit, and business operations of each applicant for a mortgage loan in advance. The maximum limit for the above mortgage loans shall be submitted to the head office for approval in advance before processing. (4) The valuation of collateral for mortgage loans or re-mortgage loans shall be based on official prices and not black market prices. (5) The term of mortgage loans and re-mortgage loans shall be a maximum of three full months. After maturity, the principle is to recover the entire amount.

<h3>Publication of New Loan Measures for the Banking Industry - All Doubts of the City's Economic Circles Resolved -</h3>
<p>Since the financial authorities promulgated loan restriction measures and issued this instruction to the banking community in this city, the general public has speculated a great deal on this issue. Rumors have spread, even suggesting that restrictions on withdrawals would affect people's confidence, which is no small matter. In fact, these rumors are completely unfounded. According to inquiries by this newspaper, the Shanghai Banking Association resolved and passed new loan measures for the banking industry the day before yesterday. Therefore, we are eager to disclose the most definite content as follows, in order to dispel the doubts of the public. The new loan measures for the banking industry are divided into two categories: new loans and old loans. Under the new loan category, there are four clauses: one for borrowers, two for collateral, three for loan terms, and four for credit loans. All restrictions are both strict and reasonable. Due to the creation of these new measures, both lenders and borrowers, even in the environment of loan restrictions, will not suffer the pain of throwing out the baby with the bathwater, and unfounded rumors in the market will also be eliminated. - Editor</p>
<p>New Loans</p>
<p>(A) Borrowers</p>
<p>(1) All loan applications from borrowers whose purpose is deemed by the bank to promote hoarding and speculation shall be rejected.</p>
<p>(2) All loan applications from companies and firms must be members of their respective trade associations or hold licenses issued by the competent authorities (such as business licenses or commercial registration approval documents, all of which are valid).</p>
<p>(3) All borrowers using goods as collateral should be limited to those who genuinely need the loans for their business.</p>
<p>(4) For loan applications from factories, the bank may provide loan assistance based on their production status.</p>
<p>(B) Collateral</p>
<p>The selection of collateral shall not violate current laws and regulations and shall not promote hoarding or speculation.</p>
<p>(1) For goods currently under control with price limits, the discount shall not exceed 60% of the price limit.</p>
<p>(2) For real estate used as collateral, the discount shall not exceed 50% of the assessed value.</p>
<p>(3) For stocks used as collateral, the discount shall not exceed 30% of the market price.</p>
<p>(4) For goods without price limits, the discount shall not exceed 30% of the market price.</p>
<p>(C) Loan Term:</p>
<p>The term of collateral loans shall be agreed upon by both parties based on the nature of the collateral, but the maximum term is three months.</p>
<p>(D) Credit Loans:</p>
<p>Credit loans are limited to companies and firms, and the amount should be carefully considered and restricted.</p>
<p>Old Loans</p>
<p>All old loans that do not comply with the above new regulations and violate the loan restriction measures recently promulgated by the Ministry of Finance shall be repaid in full upon maturity.</p>

<h3>The Issue of Trust Companies Concurrently Operating Lending Business</h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>Yesterday, newspapers carried news that the authorities were cracking down on trust companies concurrently operating lending businesses, stating: "In order to suppress commodity prices, the authorities have repeatedly ordered banks and money shops to recall all loans that do not contribute to production, thereby tightening the money supply in the market, preventing speculators from mobilizing funds, and no longer harming the market. A reporter from Commercial News recently learned that several large trust companies in this port also have banking departments established, engaging in lending business to various merchants. This type of operation clearly goes beyond the normal scope of trust company business and must be cracked down upon. Therefore, in addition to strictly ordering these companies to earnestly comply with the 'Regulations for the Management of Financial Institutions' promulgated by the government, each company is also required to voluntarily abolish its banking department business from today and recover the loans already issued as soon as possible."</p>
<p>The authorities are cracking down on improper lending and suppressing commodity prices, and their efforts are deeply admirable. However, this matter relates to the question of whether trust companies can concurrently operate lending business, which has considerable research value in practice and in law, and I would like to discuss it.</p>
<p>First, in terms of the relationship between trust companies and banks, currently, banks concurrently operate trust businesses by establishing trust departments, and trust companies concurrently operate banking businesses by establishing banking departments. The former is permitted by the Banking Law, and the latter is stipulated by the Provisional Regulations for Trust Companies. The licenses issued by the Ministry of Finance to trust companies are also banking business licenses. Therefore, in practice, there is not much difference between banks and trust companies. Because China's trust industry is still in its infancy, the concurrent operation of both is precisely to support the development of the trust industry. As for the convenience in business, it is also one of the reasons. Japan originally separated banking and trust operations. According to recent information from China, the Japanese government's cabinet passed the "Ordinary Bank Concurrent Business Law" on November 24 last year, allowing ordinary banks to concurrently operate savings banks and trust companies. If so, the Japanese system is also changing from separation to concurrent operation. Because the relationship between the business of banks and trust companies is actually too close, the advantages of concurrent operation are self-evident. This is in terms of practical situations. The concurrent operation of deposit and loan business by trust companies is a recognized fact in various countries and there is a genuine need for it.</p>
<p>Of course, facts cannot go beyond the law. The previous section mentioned that the concurrent operation of both is permitted by the banking and trust company regulations. According to Article 12 of the newly promulgated Provisional Regulations for Trust Companies in China: "Trust companies may, with the approval of the Ministry of Finance, concurrently operate the following ancillary businesses: (1) Accepting deposits, (2) Handling loans, (3) Discounting bills, (4) Remittance or foreign exchange, (5) Trading in securities and real estate, (6) Warehousing." These are all clearly banking businesses, and handling loans is especially explicitly stipulated. The establishment of current trust companies has been registered and licensed by both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, and their organizational and business regulations have been approved by both ministries. Their business reports are submitted to the financial regulatory authorities for verification on a regular basis and are also under the leadership of the Central Reserve Bank. Whether their operations have a legal basis and whether they exceed the scope are all clearly known by the authorities, and there is no difference from banks.</p>
<p>Based on the above, the concurrent operation of deposit and loan banking businesses by trust companies has a legal basis and should not be regarded as illegal business. However, what we must examine is whether there are any cases where trust company loans are being exploited by speculators. But this problem is not unique to trust companies. Recently, the authorities have strictly established principles for bank lending, prohibiting speculation, and trust companies should absolutely comply with these. This is the first thing that trust companies should examine themselves.</p>
<p>In addition, no fewer than thirty or forty new trust companies have been established in recent years. Are all of them formally registered trust companies? If there are unregistered companies operating under the name of trust companies and engaging in other businesses, or even concurrently operating lending businesses, this is naturally not permitted by law. This situation may also be unavoidable. This is the second thing that trust companies should strive to rectify among their peers.</p>
<p>The news of the crackdown on trust companies concurrently operating lending businesses published in the newspapers this time may be referring to the above two situations. It is not known for sure. That is, (1) if trust companies have made loans in violation of various laws, regulations, and orders promulgated by the authorities, they should be cracked down upon. (2) If there are unregistered trust companies, they shall absolutely not be allowed to engage in banking business. Regarding the first point, the several large formal trust companies here are subject to government supervision at all times and should not have any illegal activities. However, the attention of the authorities to this is solely for the welfare of society, and their attention is to the lending of the entire banking industry, not just trust companies. Regarding the second point, unregistered companies using the name of trust companies hinder the credibility of the entire trust industry. Cracking down on them is, of course, welcomed by the trust industry and the entire financial industry.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the news of the authorities' proposed crackdown is accurate, it may be limited to the above two situations. It is not known for sure. In short, this issue has a significant impact on the business of trust companies and the concurrent operation of trust businesses by banks. Therefore, this examination is provided for the reference of all sectors.</p>
<h3>A Perspective on Today's Insurance Industry</h3>
<p>— Lu Shenbao</p>
<p>In the past two years, the insurance business has progressed rapidly. The number of newly established companies is as numerous as bamboo shoots after rain. People in society often talk about it, and there are many records and discussions in books and newspapers. However, most of them are written by economists based on academic theories or statistics. As for those who are engaged in the industry and make comments based on the actual situation, there are relatively few. I am not talented, so I would like to briefly write about my observations over the years, based on the recent development and business improvement of the insurance industry, investment direction, and claims settlement situation. Although it is a limited view, it is all a narrative of facts.</p>
<p>The Causes and Effects of the Sudden Development of the Insurance Industry</p>
<p>There are three far-reaching reasons for the sudden development of the insurance industry in recent years: first, the differentiation of insurance practitioners themselves; second, the decline of foreign insurance companies and the search for a way out by their employees; and third, the reckless actions of blind speculation and investment.</p>
<p>The differentiation of insurance practitioners and leaders is actually the main cause of this deformed development. According to the Chinese insurance companies in the past, Taiping and China were the leaders in the industry, with no less than a thousand employees. Over the years, those in charge often had the problem of difficult allocation of affairs and positions. Therefore, those with strength or foresight who knew that foreign companies would inevitably decline competed for the plan to be strong. Datong created first, and Danan followed. Since then, there have been many new companies that have sprouted from the Taiping China atom. Commentators believe that the establishment of these companies at that time had not yet deviated from the right track of insurance.</p>
<p>When foreign insurance companies declined, most of their Chinese personnel lost their support. These personnel had previously created a considerable position in the insurance industry due to the power of foreign companies, but their business methods were not approved by some Chinese companies. They would not take low positions, and they were not tolerated in high positions. Therefore, in a situation where they were unwilling to bow their heads and no one would ask for advice, the organization of new companies began. At the same time, some blind investors and speculators helped their prestige, thinking that insurance companies did not need capital at all. Even if there was capital, it could be used for other purposes. For example, with a capital of 5 million yuan, 2 million yuan could be used to concurrently operate a bank, and the rest could be used to concurrently operate dozens of businesses such as cloth factories, match factories, and stock brokerages. Then, the bank would absorb deposits, mutually inject funds, and support each other. The future development was unlimited. Therefore, they mutually induced each other, and insurance practitioners persuaded and used each other more widely. Since then, new companies have been established almost every day, creating an unprecedented grand situation.</p>
<p>With so many companies, business became rampant. There were as many assistant managers and deputy managers as crucian carp crossing the river. They only knew how to attract more business and offer excessive discounts. Policyholders also insured because of the relationship of directors or shareholders, only for the sake of friendship. Each did not know what insurance was at all. Brokers disregarded the insured's interests and the company's losses. The more business, the better the face, the more commission, and they went to all lengths to be humble and generous. They regarded the policyholders as the brokers' property, allowing them to be taken from Company A to Company B, and then reinsured to Company C. The insurance that policyholders entrusted their families to was used to this point. It is sad to say. The knowledgeable worry about it.</p>
<p>Recent Business Improvements</p>
<p>In this autumn of insurance industry boom, uniting for survival is a natural trend. Companies whose insured amount exceeds their self-retention limit must cede it to other companies for underwriting. This is a natural example of risk sharing. If any company has difficulty with reinsurance and does not limit its self-retention limit, it is a great risk to the company itself and the policyholders, and a great hindrance to the reputation of the entire Chinese industry and social stability. A certain Chinese insurance company more than ten years ago could not reinsure due to the random setting of insured prices, so it was all self-insured. As a result, the Hangzhou fire created an unprecedented opportunity for foreign companies. Therefore, reinsurance is a crucial plan for the company's own safety. For the sake of their own interests, Chinese companies have recently established Taiping Reinsurance Group and Shanghai Reinsurance Group in addition to the original Chinese Joint Reinsurance. Each has more than 20 large and small companies. The establishment of these groups can make the insurance business tend to a standard, and it is also a success of the insurance industry leaders' design, and its remedy for the current chaotic situation is no small matter.</p>
<p>The insurance price at that time was not based on any claim statistics, (it was impossible in fact), but only based on the regulations of the foreign company association at that time. After that, the Chinese company association revised and revised it, and the discount item was also based on the discount of reinsurance with foreign companies as the minimum limit. Therefore, if there is an insurance company that does not handle reinsurance, it can increase or decrease it according to the degree of risk estimated by the company itself for the insured house. However, since there is reinsurance, it is inevitable to follow the minimum discount of reinsurance as the minimum limit. Therefore, the company must reinsure, and because of reinsurance, it must maintain the insured price and discount. Reinsurance groups (joint reinsurance by several companies) are equivalent to manufacturers, insurance companies, wholesalers, and retailers, and brokers are equivalent to retailers. The retail price cannot be lower than the wholesale price, and the wholesale price cannot be lower than the factory price. Therefore, today's policyholders should know the reason for the difference in insurance price discounts.</p>
<p>However, under this situation, in order to compete for business, each company has to depreciate the price or even issue orders according to the reinsurance discount, (there is no expense for this method) which is also the last policy of commercial promotion, or the policy of maintaining the face and position of the company's salaried personnel. In this way, the company's expenses have to rely on other income, one is the contribution of the surplus of joining the reinsurance group, and the other is the income under the self-insured limit and the income from the use of funds. However, the group's surplus is distributed according to the capital and business of the entire group, and the income is very small, and the self-insured limit must not be too large, so the income is not much. Therefore, the small ones rely entirely on the use of funds. As mentioned above, it is difficult for insurance companies to rely on premium income to contribute, because in addition to the reinsurance premium, a certain percentage of the claim preparation fund under the self-insured item must also be proposed. Therefore, small companies with monthly premium income of less than 100,000 yuan cannot actually maintain expenses.</p>
<p>Considerations for Investment</p>
<p>Since the company has little hope for premium surplus, it has to rely on the use of funds. The insurance industry is closely related to the safety of the entire society. Therefore, the country has certain restrictions and supervision on the use of its funds. If it is allowed to engage in improper speculation or investment, the investor will lose the nature of investment, and once an accident occurs, there is a danger of insufficient compensation. Those who hold the position have to plan for the sake of protecting assets, which is also created by the actual environment. There is no room for denial, but in terms of law and reason, the use of insurance company funds should have certain restrictions.</p>
<p>Talk about Claims</p>
<p>Insurance is to protect against danger. In the event of an accident, the claim issue of today's insurance companies should also be discussed by those who care about the current situation of the insurance industry.</p>
<p>According to the most prosperous era of foreign companies in the past, the company's claims must be estimated by foreign public notary firms. At that time, the companies stationed in China were all agents, and their foreign head office only adopted the report of the notary firm. Therefore, the authority of the notary firm was extremely large, and the brokers all obeyed and feared it would not arrive. In the past, policyholders who had contacted the notary firm due to accidents could all tell it. Since the rise of Chinese companies, in order to avoid direct conflicts between the company and the policyholders, it is inevitable to use public notary firms. These public notary firms operated by Chinese people have learned from the criticisms of foreign notaries in the past. Therefore, most of them can follow the right path, but the right to compensation is actually in the hands of the company. Therefore, the impact is that there are those who should not be compensated and are compensated, and those who add abuse for the sake of publicity. They disregard the company's losses and the industry's regulations, and only please the brokers and policyholders, and publish thank-you advertisements in newspapers.</p>
<p>Fire insurance claims are not like gambling. However, the calculation method is very complicated, and it is all in line with the law and reason. Therefore, public notary personnel who handle claims, in addition to being honest and fair, must be well-versed in law and reason, understand human relationships, and be familiar with local market conditions, and then distinguish their true from false and make detailed estimates. The report must not only use estimated figures as the end, but must report in detail, measure the situation point by point according to law, and add judgment to make the policyholders see it and be sincerely convinced. This is closely related to the notary's credibility and the company's position. Today, whether the public notary personnel meet the above conditions will not be discussed. However, some companies actually regard claims as an advertising technique, and public notary firms are also established one after another. (At present, because strict examinations and registrations have not been implemented, it is impossible to distinguish their qualifications.) For the sake of business, they have to follow the company's orders. Often, the public notary firm first offers an estimated figure with no theory, and then the three parties add compensation. Even more, the company first negotiates a figure with the policyholders based on friendship, and then the public notary firm fills out a report. In short, some authorities adopt the method of compensating more and compensating quickly. If this continues, the competition will be more intense and the situation will get worse. The cunning will use their fraud, and the honest will start their doubts. It is not a blessing for the future of the insurance industry.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The development of each business depends on the unity of the industry. Since insurance is a social undertaking, in addition to the country's laws and regulations that must be strictly enforced, the power of the association is insufficient. It can only rely on the authority of reinsurance to use its reinsurance power for the entire adjustment. Regarding the insurance rate discount and the counter-claims, there must be an overall pace, which will be beneficial to social welfare and industry reputation. The author believes that the current is indeed a once-in-a-thousand-year opportunity for the Chinese insurance industry to lay a permanent foundation. The time is not coming again, and it is rising with the tide. The author roughly describes it for those outside the industry who regard insurance as a gold-digging movement and follow the crowd, as a reference. It also serves as a needle for policyholders who insure to protect against danger, and as a review for shareholders who invest in the insurance business.</p>

<p>Special Edition for the Father of the Nation's Death Anniversary and Afforestation Movement</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Industry's Reforestation Efforts Over the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Mei Siping</p>
<p>Last year, when I participated in the Arbor Day ceremony commemorating the death of the Father of the Nation, I raised several practical issues regarding reforestation to draw the attention of the nation. Now, another year has passed, and the holding of this year's Arbor Day ceremony inevitably reminds me of the practical issues I raised last year. What were those issues? They were the promotion of privately owned forests, forest protection, and the simultaneous implementation of forestry and land reclamation. If these issues cannot be resolved, then the annual Arbor Day ceremony will likely remain a mere formality, without any practical benefit. It must be understood that the Arbor Day ceremony is a commemorative ritual for the reforestation movement. The majority of the practical work must be carried out diligently by the agencies responsible for forestry. Therefore, to resolve these issues, it requires not only temporary attention during the Arbor Day period but also constant and sustained efforts.</p>
<p>As the head of the Ministry of Industry, forestry construction is naturally an important undertaking within my responsibilities. We must understand that construction is not just theoretical exploration but focuses on the implementation of work. Naturally, after noticing these practical issues last year, I began to implement them step by step. However, due to the short period, the progress has not been significant. This will, of course, require continued and sustained effort. Now, taking advantage of the reforestation movement, I will provide a brief report on the important work related to these issues over the past year. I also hope that all forestry agencies and people across the country will rise up, pay close attention, and work together diligently.</p>
<p>(1) Promoting Privately Owned Forests: The promotion of privately owned forests depends on the supply of seedlings, so the first step is to establish nurseries. In October of the thirty-first year of the Republic, seven nurseries were established one after another, and a general outline for seed collection and seedling cultivation was drafted and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and active implementation. At the same time, the seedlings cultivated by the various forest farms totaled 1.8 million, of which 400,000 could be allocated free of charge to the people for voluntary reforestation, in addition to supplying their own reforestation needs. Therefore, when the planting season arrived, all requests from the people for seedling distribution were met as much as possible. In total, up to now, seedlings have been distributed, including 57,000 black pine and Chinese arborvitae seedlings distributed by the Nanjing Municipal Government to the people of various townships and villages in Yanziji; 2,000 Chinese arborvitae seedlings distributed by the Eastern Zhejiang Administrative Office; 20,000 Chinese arborvitae, locust, and Chinese sweetgum seedlings distributed by the Jiashan County Government of Anhui; 3,500 white poplar, black pine, Chinese arborvitae, and Mongolian oak seedlings distributed by the Liutai County Government; 10,000 Masson pine, Chinese arborvitae, and Chinese sweetgum seedlings distributed by the Chunhua Forestry and Land Reclamation Demonstration Farm and the Changshu Agricultural Improvement Zone; and 50,000 black pine and Chinese arborvitae seedlings distributed to other institutions such as the Central Military Training Corps, the Second Guard Division, the Agricultural College of the National Central University, the China Youth Labor Corps, and the Buddhist Children's Home. Furthermore, the Forestry and Land Reclamation Bureau dispatched technical personnel to provide guidance and assistance in planting. In addition, a large number of seedlings were supplied by the Ministry for the spring replanting of the Beijige scenic forest in Beijing, and personnel were also dispatched to assist the Cultural Relics Preservation Committee in designing the planting. As for the large number of seedlings cultivated by the Ministry, it is estimated that approximately 27 million seedlings will be ready for planting from various nurseries in the thirty-third year of the Republic, which can be used to promote reforestation by the public on 70,000 mu. By the thirty-fourth year of the Republic, the number of seedlings ready for planting each year will reach 40 million, which can be used for reforestation by the public on 100,000 mu. Although the numbers are small, it is hoped that continued and sustained efforts will enable both private and state-owned forest farms to advance simultaneously. I believe that significant results can be achieved within ten years.</p>
<p>(2) Forest Protection: The only essential task after reforestation is protection. In the past, the responsibility for forest protection was mostly borne by forest police, but they failed to establish direct relationships with the people, resulting in little or no effect. Now, to achieve thorough effectiveness, the public must participate in the protection work themselves. Therefore, when we formulated the Forest Protection Regulations, we used the organization of forest protection corps to effectively protect forests. These regulations were promulgated and implemented by the National Government in August of last year. The method for the forest protection corps is to first delineate forest protection zones around the forests, with residents within the forest protection zones organized into forest protection corps according to the baojia system. All men and women over the age of ten can be members of the forest protection corps, and all members have obligations to fulfill and also enjoy corresponding rights. The obligations are: (1) Prohibiting the felling of trees and the plucking of fruits; (2) Preventing and fighting forest fires; (3) Preventing and controlling diseases and pests; (4) Monitoring and prohibiting firewood gathering, branch trimming, hunting, and grazing; (5) Assisting in reforestation. The rights are to enjoy firewood gathering, branch trimming, hunting, and grazing, and to have priority in reclaiming suitable wasteland within the forests, in accordance with the methods, periods, and sections announced publicly. This forest protection corps organization establishes a direct relationship between the forests and the nearby residents, urging the public to protect the forests themselves. It can also promote the public's interest in reforestation. The Ministry's original forestry and land reclamation demonstration farms No. 1, No. 9, No. 11, and No. 12 have all been established and are actively promoting implementation. In the future, we must continue to strive for universality, so that all forest areas in the country have forest protection corps organizations.</p>
<p>(3) Simultaneous Implementation of Forestry and Land Reclamation: Reforestation and land reclamation are closely related, and the periods for land reclamation and reforestation work also differ in sequence. In terms of human resource utilization, they can be mutually adjusted. Moreover, reforestation is a long-term undertaking, while land reclamation yields harvests annually. Therefore, economically, it can also be used to contribute. Therefore, last year, the Ministry first established the Forestry and Land Reclamation Bureau and then gradually merged and reorganized the past forest farms and land reclamation demonstration farms, establishing twelve forestry and land reclamation demonstration farms, so that the two demonstration matters of forestry and land reclamation are handled within one farm. This was organized and established on November 1st of last year. On one hand, cultivating fields and planting forests, and on the other hand, reclaiming land and increasing production, utilizing barren mountains and wastelands suitable for forestry and land reclamation for cultivation and planting, combined with demonstration. Since its implementation, it has taken on a rough form. In the future, it should be continually urged to proceed, in order to receive greater results.</p>
<p>In summary, over the past year, the three practical issues have been addressed with some progress, but they have not yet reached perfection. In the future, we should continue to work hard, building on the work of the past year and gradually expanding. At the same time, we hope to expand from the central government to the local governments, so that the reforestation effort can be popular throughout the country. This is not only the responsibility of one individual but also depends on the concerted efforts of all those who care about reforestation to work together to achieve success.</p>
<h3>Public Awareness of the Reforestation Movement</h3>
<p>— Yuan Yuqian</p>
<p>We must understand that reforestation is a construction project for the general public and is by no means the responsibility of any one sector of the public. The government's implementation of the reforestation movement aims to promote a thorough understanding of the benefits of reforestation among the public and to encourage everyone to work hard on reforestation. This task of reforestation can turn useless barren mountains into useful ones, provide employment for the unemployed, and turn them into employed people. This is a major undertaking of productive construction. Increased production can save the declining people and revitalize the weak nation. Its relationship is so important that the people of the whole country should unite and expand the reforestation movement for the construction of the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>We must also understand that the reforestation movement is not only for the welfare of the country and the people in the future but is also a current method of saving the country and the people. This kind of movement not only saves people but is indeed self-help. It is greatly beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. However, because it originates from the government's advocacy, the general public often mistakenly believes that it is a government matter, and not only does not earnestly promote it, but also does not have the concept of cherishing the trees that have already been planted by the public, and even damages them, resulting in very little effect after many years of reforestation. Up to now, barren mountains are still visible everywhere. The national economy has no way to be enriched, and the people's livelihood is therefore becoming increasingly difficult. Therefore, the country and the people are as poor and weak as before. It must be understood that the people's destruction of trees directly damages public property, but indirectly promotes the people's distress and the country's demise, no different from harming one's own life. Now that we are constantly calling for the survival of the country and the nation, we should unite and implement and expand this reforestation movement to increase productive construction and strengthen the strength of the country and the nation in order to achieve the goal of survival. We must also understand that the reforestation movement is not only beneficial to the general public but can also meet the needs of the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors of the public and provide special benefits. For example, farmers engaged in reforestation can make appropriate use of land that is not suitable for cultivation, allowing the whole family to have work to do. As a result of production, it is enough to supply the needs of one's own family for firewood and timber: at large, it can also obtain permanent income to relieve famine and drought disasters. Workers engaged in reforestation can increase timber production, supply raw materials needed for industry, and not only do not have the risk of unemployment themselves, but their families also get income from forest by-products. Merchants engaged in reforestation can turn the smallest expense into a huge value of forest, as insurance savings, and once they encounter an economic panic, they can still maintain their business without defeat with the safe savings of forest capital. Others, such as soldiers, can engage in reforestation, which can enhance their own professional skills, develop an interest in engaging in productive work, and avoid losing their livelihood after being discharged from the army. Students and general intellectuals engaged in reforestation, in addition to gaining interest in labor and developing diligent habits, are also unknowingly refined by the natural beauty of the forest because of their love for their own planted trees, thereby enhancing their lively spirit and cultivating noble virtues. Therefore, if people from all walks of life want to seek their own special benefits and permanent happiness, they should unite and implement and expand this reforestation movement with the greatest benefits and the most macroscopic effects.</p>
<h3>The Guiding Principles for Developing Chinese Forestry</h3>
<p>— Shao Zhongxiang</p>
<p>Today is the 18th anniversary of the death of the Father of the Nation, and it is also the beginning of this year's reforestation movement. The National Government scheduled the reforestation movement to be held on the anniversary of the death of the Father of the Nation, and its significance is very profound, because the purpose of this movement is to promote reforestation, realize the Father of the Nation's industrial plan, and build a large-scale national forest to prevent floods and droughts, relieve farmers, and develop industry and commerce. The connotation is so important that the government and the people should encourage each other to work hard to ensure the success of forestry construction with the main purpose of seeking truth from facts.</p>
<p>Speaking of developing Chinese forestry, we should proceed from the following guiding principles:</p>
<p>(1) Vigorously Implement Forestry Protection: Protecting forests is more difficult than creating forests. This statement has been generally recognized by modern foresters. Therefore, protecting forests is more necessary than creating forests, especially urgently. Although the barren mountains and wilds do not have artificial tree planting, they can often be nurtured into beautiful forests by the power of nature due to careful protection. Those that have been formally afforested artificially can also gradually turn into barren mountains and wilds due to inadequate protection. This kind of fact can be seen everywhere as long as we pay attention to observation. Therefore, in order to rapidly develop national forestry, the most important work from now on is to pay attention to the problem of forest protection. All mountains, fields, and forest lands, whether naturally grown or artificially planted, should be strictly protected to enable them to grow into good timber. As for the performance evaluation of public and private industry farms, do not pay attention to the number of tree seedlings they plant, but pay special attention to the results of their protection of mature timber forests.</p>
<p>(2) Implement Reforestation with Forests: The implementation of any construction undertaking must have sufficient funds in order to develop as much as possible. Forestry is also a kind of construction undertaking, and naturally cannot escape this common principle. However, in terms of China's current economic strength, in order to prevent forestry development from being restricted by the economy, unless we implement the policy of reforestation with forests, it will not be possible to succeed.</p>
<p>China has a vast territory, and its climate and soil are unique. In all the high mountains and ridges with sparse population in the country, there are still many natural forests. According to expert surveys, in the north, such as Hebei, Henan and other provinces; in the central part, such as Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei and other provinces; in the south, such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian and other provinces. The forest area exceeds 700 million mu, which is more than three times the forest area of Germany, the most developed country in forestry. These large forests are now unutilized due to traffic congestion, and the benefits are abandoned on the ground. If we can apply scientific methods to cultivate them, protect them, develop them, and utilize them, so as to achieve the effect of making the best use of the land and making the best use of things, then the national economy will naturally be sufficient, and it can be used to build other forests or develop other forestry projects, and naturally can avoid the difficulty of funding.</p>
<p>(3) Popularize Forestry Knowledge: The rise and fall of a country's forestry depends on the popularity of forestry knowledge. Because forestry construction must have a considerable understanding of forestry by the majority of the people, because understanding can generate interest, and with interest, they will accumulate efforts in forest protection and management. The Father of the Nation paid special attention to the construction of psychology in the initial stage of material construction, and the intention was like this. China's forestry has been abandoned for a long time, and the people's forestry knowledge is very immature. For example, many farmers do not know about seedling cultivation. Therefore, from now on, we should follow the government's regulations on the purpose of the reforestation movement and make more efforts in promoting forestry knowledge in order to achieve popularity.</p>
<p>(4) Support the Development of Private Forests: "Speaking of the problem of planting forests throughout the country, it is still easier to succeed if the state manages it," this is what the Father of the Nation once showed us, and we must naturally respectfully follow it. However, in modern China, if we want to collect all the barren mountains in the country that are suitable for reforestation, whether large or small, and build forests solely by the government's power, it will be difficult to do it thoroughly, and it will not be possible to do it in the short term. Therefore, in addition to those related to public safety and national defense, as well as other large barren mountains or special areas, which are divided into state-owned forest areas, in the small pieces and small blocks of mountain farms in a considerable area, we must work hard to support the development of private forestry. Because the purpose of the state's management of forestry is to seek welfare for the people, if the people can manage forestry that is beneficial to themselves and beneficial to the entire country under considerable conditions, the government will naturally support and assist them in carrying out it.</p>
<p>What I have said above is just a brief mention of the guiding principles that should be adopted for developing Chinese forestry. As for how to plan and proceed, we should determine the plan at any time and place, referring to the situation.</p>
<p>To go a step further, forestry is a continuous production undertaking, and in order to ensure the success of national forestry construction, the people of the whole country must have continuous efforts. It is hoped that people in the forestry industry throughout the country can always work down-to-earth, and it is hoped that people outside the forestry industry can always give practical assistance to the utmost, so that the Father of the Nation's policy of building a large-scale national forest can be realized in the shortest time, which is the greatest purpose of holding the reforestation movement today.</p>
<h3>The Benefits of Reforestation</h3>
<p>— Ministry of Industry's Forestry and Land Reclamation Bureau</p>
<p>Speaking of "reforestation," people in our country's cities regard it as an undertaking of the government and do not know how to value it. People in the countryside are even more at a loss, only knowing that planting trees is a casual matter that does not matter. It can be said that eight out of ten people do not pay attention to reforestation, and they do not know that it has a very close relationship with the country, society, and people. This is all because they cannot thoroughly understand the benefits of reforestation. Now, taking advantage of the opportunity of the capital's reforestation movement, we will introduce the direct and indirect benefits of reforestation to everyone.</p>
<p>(1) Direct Benefits:</p>
<p>(1) Producing Timber Timber is the main and largest product of forests, and it is also something that we need every day. Think about the houses and beds we live in, the bridges and vehicles we travel on, the materials for agricultural tools used in farming, the textile equipment and all the utensils in our homes, which one is not made of timber, which one can be without timber, that is, the equipment used in the mining industry, industry, and other various undertakings, although not necessarily exclusively timber, but timber is indeed an important part.</p>
<p>(2) Supplying By-products In addition to producing timber, forests also have incidental production, such as resin, tung oil, pine oil, camphor, and paint materials. Cork, etc., are sometimes mainly used for producing these kinds of products for reforestation, such as lacquer forests and camphor forests in Fujian, tung oil forests in Zhejiang, etc. It can be seen that these kinds of by-products are very much needed in society.</p>
<p>(3) Developing Capital Forest capital includes growing trees and the land on which trees grow. All land in the world that cannot grow crops can be used to grow trees. If it is used as much as possible to plant trees, then the area occupied by forest land, the capital invested, and the labor used will be very large. Although this kind of investment cannot be recovered immediately, it is a long-term asset.</p>
<p>(4) Accommodating Labor My country's forest land is larger than any other country, so the work of reforestation, felling, transportation, sawing boards, and allocating materials will naturally accommodate a great deal of labor. In addition, incidental undertakings, such as timber transportation agencies and by-product manufacturing agencies, require even more labor than reforestation and felling. Germany is the most developed country in forestry in the world, and 12% of its population depends on forests for their livelihood. If my country's forestry is developed, there is no need to worry about surplus labor.</p>
<p>(5) Improving Soil Quality Trees need relatively little fertilization, and barren land can also grow trees. For example, leguminous plants such as Burmese albizia and acacia not only do not consume nutrients in the soil, but also absorb nitrogen from the air, making it an important fertilizer in the soil. Therefore, reforestation of barren land also has the effect of improving soil quality. Even if other seedlings cannot absorb nitrogen as fertilizer, the branches and leaves that fall after they wither remain on the ground and become fertilizer once they are腐化. Soil can be changed from barren to fertile. Barren land exists in all provinces of our country, especially in the northwest border provinces, where there are more barren areas. Now the government is vigorously advocating reforestation and reclaiming wasteland. If we can engage in reforestation according to the climate and soil quality of each place, first seek to improve the soil quality, and then plant crops after the soil quality is improved, it may not be the way to production.</p>
<p>(2) Indirect Benefits:</p>
<p>(1) Increasing Rainfall Forests have the effect of lowering temperatures and evaporating moisture, so places with forests are more humid than places without forests, and when moist air passes through forests, it immediately causes moisture to condense into rain when it encounters the relatively low and humid air flowing out of the forest land, and fall to the ground, so places with forests often have more rainfall than places without forests.</p>
<p>(2) Preventing Natural Disasters Forests can prevent wind disasters by using the strong trunks and broad crowns of forests to resist wind and reduce the mechanical action of disasters: therefore, countries use forests as natural barriers in places near the sea or near smoke damage. Places with forests can also prevent drastic changes in surface temperature and hinder the rapid rise of air currents. With these two kinds of power, it can reduce the area of hail and reduce hail damage.</p>
<p>(3) Eliminating Floods and Droughts Forests can reduce floods and droughts because forests have the effect of conserving water sources. First, the crowns of forests can prevent the drying and evaporation of water in the land. Second, the fallen leaves, mosses, and roots of forests can prevent the outflow of water. According to actual verification, the evaporation of forest land is only half that of bare land. As for the outflow of water from forests, foresters in various countries have detailed investigations, which can reach 76%, so that this water can flow down slowly, so that it will not wash away sediment and silt up the riverbed, causing floods.</p>
<p>(4) Benefiting Hygiene People in mountain forests have longer average life spans than people in cities, which is a fact that we all recognize. Although there are many reasons for this, the main one is that the air contains the oxygen necessary for our lives. It is because of the physiological respiration of trees that they can eliminate the carbon dioxide in the air, which is harmful to humans, and release the best oxygen for our needs. Therefore, the closer to the forest, the more oxygen there is, and the farther away from the forest, the less oxygen there is. Also, because the air in forest areas is often kept clean, pathogens are not easy to reproduce and are not easy to spread. Also, drinking water is often a major medium for transmitting diseases. The spring water in mountain forests is much cleaner than the drinking water in cities without forest areas. Therefore, it is no doubt that the air in forest areas has more oxygen and is cleaner, and the spring water is clean, which is beneficial to hygiene.</p>
<p>(5) Embellishing the Scenery Scenery is something that we humans cannot forget. However, scenery cannot be established without the embellishment of forests. Because in addition to increasing the fun, the lush and beautiful scenery and majestic posture of forests can make people's spirits refreshed and their ambitions noble everywhere. Therefore, in the East and West countries, whether in cities or villages, there are places where trees are planted next to roads and houses to increase their beauty. There are also specially planted forests to provide people with recreation, and the intention is very profound.</p>
