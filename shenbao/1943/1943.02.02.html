<p>社評</p>
<h3>「奢侈即敵人」—再論戰時消費節約</h3>
<p>近代戰是總力戰。它必須集中一切人民的力量，以提供給爲人民所擁戴的政府，俾作　當的支配，而爭取戰爭的勝利。那一個國家所集中的力量最龐大充實而應用最適當，那一個國家就最有勝利的把握。反之，那一個國　不能集結全國一切心力物力與人力，或是有意無意　把心力人力和物力作無意義的消耗，那麽，這一個國家就會遭達到失敗。所以，一方面必須有一個爲全民所擁戴的强力的政府，對於全國力量適當的應用，絕不許有消費的現象。另一方面，更必須要求全國人民絕對避免對於人力物力作不必要的消耗，絕對不許戰時有任何方面的奢侈現象。</p>
<p>「奢侈即敵人，這是戰後日本最流行的一個口號。因爲國民生活的奢侈，勢必過分地消耗國家的人力和物力，减輕近代戰中對敵人總力戰中的比重，减少本國對敵制勝的因素，不問你有意或是無意，結果都變成幫助敵人。所以用「奢侈即敵人」的口號，提髙全國國民的警惕性，大家力戒奢侈，節的消費，使國家保存更多的人力和物力，以與敵人作戰，而爭取最後的勝利。其實，日本自中日事變以後，全國上下，早已　策羣力的實行了節的政策，國民生活，都已符合戰時標準。舉凡衣，食，住，行諸　，都在政府法令範圍之內，表現出戰時生活的特包。一般人民的消費，都受政府的統制與指導，幾種主要的食料衣料，及日用品，早已實行配給制和票券制，即住居和行動（車輛交通）即都在嚴格的管制之下。近來更爲適應戰爭的長期化起見，積集更多的人力與物力，以便造成克服敵方的力量，而促使「長期戰」在短期內勝利結束，已進一步實行普遍的節的運動。例如中午宴會，規定每客以二元五角爲限，晚間以五元爲限，政府與民間一律如此。他如小學生的用紙，每星期亦有限度。又如政府發給人民的領購消費品的票券，今年將更要减少，而領購物品時需付的票券則將增多，以政府有計劃有組織的力量，推行節約運動，表面上雖然增加國民的不便，但其目的是要求大家忍受一時的不便，以求縮短戰爭時間，早獲勝利。實際上這種禁止奢侈，實行節的的辦法，連一向以國民生活奢侈著稱的敵國英美，也早已實行嚴格的限制消費政策了。例如英國人民，在衣的方面，舉凡衣服，衣料的購置，皆受嚴格的統制，每人必須先辦理登記手續，才能得一証書，裏面共有六十六張票子，大槪做套西裝，要付二十二張票子，購皮鞋一變，就要五張票子，領帶一條，也要票子兩張。政府限制你一年內只消費六十六張票于，票子用完了，有錢也買不到穿的東四。吃的方面，買麵包·牛奶·牛油等食物，皆有指定的商舖，限制極嚴，有時一星期祗能買到一次牛肉或羊肉。過去一飡有好幾道菜，現在已流行一湯一菜一點心了。住的方面，過去一家獨住的，現在都由政府指定，四五家合住了在一起。又如紙的來源，英國一向是靠加拿大及挪威的，戰時因航運關係。絨的來源是减少了，所以英政府曾發起一個收集廢紙的運動。現在英國商店中買東西，都沒有包東西的紙張，譬如你買一雙皮鞋，從商店出來，也祇能用手拿着。政府機關郵寄的公文，都裝在破舊的信封內，一個信封，多則用七八次，少則用三四次。反願我國，雖然倡導節約的大有其人，但是盡情奢侈，恣意揮雀的還是普遍得很。</p>
<p>在戰時，應由政府厲行節的，理由非常明顯。對於我國出產不很充足，及消耗量勢將增加的日用必需消費品，如衣料，食料之類，應有合理的節制，求取供需的平衡，以達平定物價目的，即是非日用必需的髙價消費品，通常所謂奢侈品，也須加以注意；因爲求取生活的優越舒適，本是人類慾望之一，只要有好吃好玩的東西可以得到，總想弄它到手。爲了滿是這種慾望，無錢的想弄到有錢，有錢的則想弄到更多的錢，而　投機之便風行一時了。物價為之暴漲，社會之大，實不容忽視。故對於非必須品或奢侈品之節制，對於不正當的娛樂所的限制，　爲當前必須加以考慮的問題。我們相信只要有通盤的打算，周詳的考率和合理的搬法，那麼禁止奢侈節制消費品的結果，消極方面固然可以替國家社會減少消費，節約物資人力，積極方面便可增加國民的正當工作時間與生產力　，使社會走上正常之途。</p>
<p>消費節約，嚴禁奢侈，不僅是爲参戰的新環境所必需，也是和平建國萬不容忽視的。不過在節約消費與嚴禁奢侈中，最重要還在人民自動的注意，和社會制裁力量的充分發　；所以我們一方面期待政府早定全面的合理的辦法，一方面更期待　會各方面的努力，上自政府，下至人民，共起而消除我們的第一敵人—奢侈？這裏，政治工作人員的模範作用，居有第一的意義。而特別要喚起當局與社會領袖們注意的是；我們今日說嚴禁奢侈與節約消費的對象。是指那些有錢有勢的社會上成份子，而不是不是小民。老實說，今日大多數的老百姓正在即寒交迫之中掙扎着，他們不但說不上奢侈，更說不上節約，若是一切嚴禁與限制只在小民頭上打圈子，那是沒有效果的。</p>

<h3>日本政治動向　形成「戰爭第一」主義　朝野合力求貫澈目標</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社特電　大東亞戰爭下之日本爲完遂　　、自須致力於增强戰力及擴充生　、日本政治動向亦以政治力之統一集中目標、俾能確立施政之基本條件、過去日本國內政治·經濟·文化以及國民生活等各方面、均充滿自由主義之餘毒、自當首先予以澈底注意、由此而確立日本民挨由醒覺中所產生之新世界觀及新秩序、期能確革新東亞以至世界之信念、而求世界之永久和平、目前此項念之實行第一目標厥爲完遂大東亞戰爭、以擊滅妄想維持舊秩序之英美、但以大東亞戰爭已有長期戰之趨勢、故消耗之鉅勢所必然、因此生產之大量增加亦屬必要、昔日以政治爲主戰爭爲輔之局勢、已轉而有戰爭爲主政治爲輔之傾向、故國內之戰爭必勝體制、自須更加强化、日政府於戰爭開始以後、即着手革新行政機構、如準備行政簡素之實施、內外行政之統一、大東亞省之設立、同時凡所施策均着重於增强生產、如强化統制會、重編中小商工業、整備金融資金機構·確立集中所有資材·運輸資金·勞力戮力、經營方式等、以增强生產、最近為期獲得增強戰力之預期成效起見、又公布戰時行政職　特例·及戰時行政特例法案等、以謀增强政治力之統一、此種動向於戰爭及政治方面、足以顯示戰爭有優先之立塲、如戰時行政特別法案中、卽規定行政大臣之首相有指揮同爲行政大臣之閣僚之權限、因此已往所謂政治等第一體制已難期實現、而形成戰爭第一之事實、故今日日本政治動向、即可謂已集中於完遂戰爭、同時議會本身之因此將有重大轉變及發展、自不待言、溯日本議會性格之發展，於中日事變發生時、即已有變動之趨勢，蓋當時議會雖爲由憲法規定之國民參政機關、但實際上已完全爲各政黨所把持、政友會民政黨卽爲其最著者、各黨因權利政略而致互相鬥爭、及至中日事變發生後、日國內深感有强化國內政治體制之必要、故於政治方面首即一變以往黨政派把持之作風、如廣田內閣、阿部內閣、近衛內閣等、即以各黨各派之綜合力量、及各方勢力之均衡、而於政治上發揮其能力、翼政會阿部總裁曾闡述議會·國民，及政府三者對於旣定國策之實　應取之態度稱、全體議員應摒棄黨派私見、和衷共濟、議會之職責旣非毫無方針追隨政府、亦非與政府作一時之妥協、乃係根據崇　之國家立塲、對於政府應匡正者匡正之、應建議者建議之、尤必須深切認識時局、以完成所負使命、即議員與政府居誠　策勵之地位、關於實施旣定政策、尤不可不鞭策政府並予協力云、故本屆議會之從戰時議會進而爲決戰議會、其目的即在求戰爭積極增强戰力、以及因此而整備國內體制、日本政府此次向議會提出各項車要法案各預算案等、俾由此向世界闡明日政府貫澈戰爭之方針、並激勵國民之決戰意志、議　方面集中國家總力積極協力政府之氣氛亦極爲旺盛、且當議會開會之前、有多數議員即以各省委員資格、協力擘劃各項行政方策、另有一部份議員復組織戰力增强挺身隊、並於議會中普遍採納地方官民意見、休會期中亦就增强戰力及戰時行政等作積極協力、對政府所提法案、先由全體議員愼重推選代表詳加審議、開會之時、又採取重點主義、凡此情形皆爲空前所未有、故今日日本國民及政府議會業已團結一致、以必勝之信念決心、排除萬難勇往邁進、同時議會方面亦與此呼應、不分黨派、議員依然爲國民之代表、但亦爲各種利益集團之代表、以言政府與議會關係、因兩者立塲不同、意見難免抵觸、但議會爲國民之代表、自當監督政府、此種傾向在大東亞戰爭爆發後之日本議會中即已完全改變、且從而確立日本議會之眞正性格、</p>

<p>瑞士京城三十一日哈瓦斯社電　潛艇戰爭仍為英美軍政各界注意焦點、據倫敦方面消息、護航制度因防備潛艇活動未週、完全失效、查第一次大戰時、英國方面曾設計防禦方法數種、以便制止德國潛水艇之活動、據邱吉爾（當時任海軍大臣）宣稱、某一時時期幾乎完全將德國制服、驅逐艦隊用以驅逐潛艇、水電網亦經敷設、敷網範圍擴大至英吉利海峽、「Q艦」（偽裝之潛水艇驅逐艦）亦加入服務、但保障海洋運輸之唯一有效辦法、厥為利用兵艦保護航運、在嚴密保護下之商船隊、往往取徑曲折之海道、第一次大戰末期、護航商船百分之九十九均能達到目的地、迨至此際、局勢顯已愈益困難、成羣結隊活動之潛艇已能突破護航防　、護航制度因而代價甚巨、同時亦極鮮效果、各軍事專家以為護航制度、具有下列各項困難、（一）保護商船隊須用多數兵艦、此項兵艦倘在他處、或將更為有用、（二）護航隊行駛速率、以最慢之一艘為標準、因此各次航程均大為延長、（三）各護航隊必須在特定日期聚集於某某港口、結果所屆、滿載貨物之商船空自等候、且須繞道以達集中點、多費一重週折、（四）護航隊之目的地、往往毫無碼頭設備、卸貨極為困難、各商船到達之後又須滯留多日、有時陸續卸貨須歷數星期之久、有時甚或在卸貨時期、猶受空中轟炸之威脅、凡此各節、上次大戰時均已經歷、但此際情形益形嚴重、英美兩國所處地位亦較一九一八年更形困難、英美之海道交通綫已完全剝奪、其所受之損失已極重大、况自北美至英國、再自英國取道開浦鎭至北非、交通綫均極遼長、英國現不僅須對付德國潛水艇在大西洋之危機、並須顧及日本潛艇在太平洋及印度洋之活動、使其有左支右絀之苦、社尼資海軍上將就任德國艦隊司令後、證明德國意欲擴大潛水艇戰爭、果爾　倫敦方面對此勢將愈形不安矣、</p>

<h3>安勃洛希沃繼任　義國總參謀長　德續有六將領晋級</h3>

<h3>强有力的東條內閣　不重資望而拔擢新進　貫激忘私奉公之精神　譯自一月號「企業」　（一）</h3>
<p>東條內閣的性質</p>
<p>內閣四長官政治的勢力，從來沒有像東條內閣這樣强有力的、鈴木企劃院總裁兼任國務大臣，谷情報局總裁除原職外，並兼任外務大臣。如此。現內閣四長官中擁有國務大臣二人，以前也從未有此先例。東條內閣在强化總理大臣權限上，不採取改正內閣官制的形式，而從强化總理大臣的政治幕僚的權限方面着手。</p>
<p>昭和十六年十月，繼第三次近衛內閣的辭職　拜受組閣大命的東條英機中將，當銓衡閣僚時，避不延攬知名人士。當時的國際情勢，日趨緊迫，政黨雖暫時解體，但舊的政黨首領，仍握有左右政治的潛勢力。所以一般人都以為將網羅各階層的代表，組成首腦內閣。但東條首相竟出乎此方面揣測，而大膽，拔擢地位較低的舊知。東條首相似早已胸有成竹從組閣時起，即已決定了內閣運營的根本方針。</p>
<p>所謂首腦內閣，在有效能的政治力的發揮上，是否適當，殊値得加以討論。近衛內閣嘗延攬宇垣一成，末次信正，池田成彬等所謂政界財界的大人物，辛勤地從事於非常內閣的統一。但並沒有獲致預期的效果。東條首相為避此前車覆轍，不僅不延攬大人物，並且重視個人的關係，當銓衡閣僚時極力避免不熟識的人士。他選擇了確信自己勢力所能達到的人士。東條內閣的起用谷外務大臣，靑木大東亞大臣，迄今仍維持這一貫的法則。但因此而有親族內閣之誚。此為東條內閣的第一特貫，前述以同志為重心而設置的內閣四長官為其第二物質。</p>
<p>東條內閣的政治中心勢力，當然操於此內閣四長官之手。像英國戰時內閣中「主腦會議」那樣的强有力的內閣組織，在中國事變勃發後不久，嘗加以研究，四長官會議在某種意義上，即具有「主腦會議」的機能與實力。</p>
<p>由於同志間的結合而組織的內閣，置其政治的中心於四長官，這種方式，果如東條首相所期，發揮了强有力的內閣政治力。東條內閣揭虊「言行一致」為其最高的原則。一反以前內閣祇尚空談不務實際的弊害，而獲得了國民的聲援與信賴。東條內閣的言行一致之能够成功，其最大原因，實有賴於上述新的內閣運營的方式。</p>
<p>為整理統合各行政機構，而設立的大東亞省，這種政治力的能够產生，當然亦種因於此，而為歷代內閣所忘塵莫及的。大東亞省原案，在內閣四長官手中　為秘密，於閣議開會數日前始提出於閣僚之前，即有閣僚持不同的見解，然已措手不及。</p>
<p>東條首相政治的運用，如行政的簡素化，與各部共管事項的整理等，對於各部牢不可破的派閥主義，最為有效。各部大臣各有堅執的固性與强大的權限，總理大臣的地位，在各部大臣的勢力均衡上纔能安定。在這種內閣中，欲施行各種改革，極為困難，轉不如起用資位較遜的同志，置其政治的中心於內閣四長官，在此基礎上推進强力政治，來得易於見效。於此，東條首相幾於完全獲得了他所期待的効果。</p>
<p>內閣四長官的職務</p>
<p>上述東條閣的物質，內閣四長官的權力異常强大，所以內閣四長官的地位，不能不以得人為第一，又擔任內閣四長官的人物應較任何人更公而忘私，精勤於自己的職務，此係出於東條首相的本性的要求。東條首相的為人，直情徑行，是典型的富於信念的人。律己剛正而嚴肅。在忘私的信念上，毅然實行自身熟慮所得的結果，具有絕大的確信。經熟慮判斷後，敏速處斷事務，這一種政治運用方法，在戰時行政上，正合於以判斷及實行為第一的要求。因此，東條首相本人的性格倔强，富於自信，但這樣的性格易為偏見所蔽，於是輔佐內閣的四長官的職務，遂愈感重大。</p>
<p>在戰時　不用說一應絕對避免政變。日本自中國事變以來，最近的政治史上，已多次政變，在奮鬥中的國家指導者，往往率先以殉國難，日本在此點上不及其盟邦德義。內閣辭職，即視為內閣的責任業已完了，這種政變的槪念，在戰時殊為危險。在日本舊的政變觀念，已被撥棄，擁戴東條內閣，為完遂大東亞戰爭而猛進，為戰時下課於國民的職責，東條首相獻身國家鞠躬盡瘁之忱，為中國事變以來任何內閣首領所未見，所以日本國民決不吝寄與完全的信賴。</p>
<p>但以上所說的，並不是指內閣首腦部的一切行動都無條件的正當化。內閣四長官的職務有輔佐東條首相的意義上，愈感重大，業如前述。東條首相為軍人，其率直性亦表現於政治上，為其輔佐的內閣幕僚，其態度自應冷靜地博採衆議，勸進最善的政策，而無我的精神，更為必要。內閣幕僚的這種修養，對於東條首相，對於國民，為完成戰時政策，同為迫切的要求。</p>
<p>戰時下的政府首腦部，自不能畏艱避難，敷衍塞實。以戰時的名義為護符，拒諫忠言，排斥批判，就是濫用戰時這名詞。在戰時，國民有不能己於言者，假使對此批判，用戰時的名義來作為防身之楯，是戰時下最惡毒的罪惡。</p>
<p>在完遵大東亞戰爭的途上，以擴充生產力為中心的戰力擴充方策，業已脫離了資本主義的追求利潤的舊槪念，而向結集國民總力的大道邁進，前途正多荊棘。大東亞戰爭能獲得最後的勝利，亦必相當艱巨，於此，我們所要求於內閣幕僚—在勝利完成前不再更動的內閣幕僚—者，須有熱血橫流的殉國精神，與冷靜的科學建設的頭腦。當此新春，我們祝福光榮的戰時內閣的幕僚愈加健鬥，同時並希望他們更加精進，努力不懈。</p>
<p>東條內閣施政方針</p>
<p>東條內閣的重心，當然是東條首相，曾在陣前指揮的東條英機中將，是當於信念而富於情感的人。在議會答辯時的盛氣相向，正為其眞情的洩露。政治家型所特有的敷衍搪塞，不着邊際的習氣，從好處說來是洗練，從壞處說來是政治的狡猾，東條首相絲毫未沾染這惡習。</p>
<p>東條首相的所以能深獲人心，根本上在於他的忘私奉公的和責任政治的運營·這大槪出自首相本身純粹性格，他在言行一致的鐵則下，即以軍人的純情實現於政治。當遭遇難題事時，決不　　，而從正面直進。他決不像從來的政治家一樣施用政治的謀略，也不玩弄虛僞的應酬工夫，例如學制改　案，大家知道一經閣議決定，即成為正式的官制，忠實於言行一致的信念，並不畏懼困難，毅然實行前內閣　於中國事變採取現地解決不擴大方針，而蹉跎至於　大，與現內閣爽朗的發動大東亞戰爭探治根本病原，這二者之間有霄壤之別，其分歧點亦即在於運營政治方式的不同。</p>
<p>在他方面，東條首相亦有忍苦耐勞，處事細心的性格，例如首相在街頭進出時，有人詢以首相的心境如何，他說：「世人往往詢及我最感興趣的是什麼，喜歡那一種遊戲，性之所近的個人嗜好是什麼？這決不是此時輕易談到的事。」他的回答是：「第一，擔任了輔弼的大任，聖上旣以赤子之心為心，則總理的責任，當然亦體現此赤誠。第二，閣議所決定的事項，即在閣議上決定的政府方策，怎樣滲透於國民的下層組織，則不能不深入體察，以窺其隱。第三，為共擔產業戰　與前綫將士的勞苦，自己　拼命的工作，以喚起產業戰士的更加奮勉，使前綫將士知道後方的寗靜。」自老至幼和產業戰士們，聽到這話的，莫不深體首相的心情，這實是東條首相的深淵的政治哲學，實是製造心理的上策。前近衛公，不能說是不知別人性格的人，然因民衆直接的聯繫非常薄弱。而東條首相即在街頭進出時，也意外地能深獲人心，而他的回答說：「這不是此時輕易談到的事」的一句話，使我們對之，不禁湧起無限的敬感。</p>

<h3>矛盾與紛亂情緒下得　美國教育制度　刻板的軍事訓練　忘記了精神力量　阿根廷京城　細川特派員</h3>
<p>（二十三日發）美國現正以髙度的軍事國家爲目標，而改組政府各機關，重編經濟機構，並改革各種針會組織。敎育界在這戰時態勢的在濤下，也發生了很大的變態。這傾向的主要特微，大體如次：</p>
<p>學校設施的軍事化</p>
<p>本學年內美國陸海軍中有二十五萬軍人，進入大學，專門學校肄業，受特殊的專門敎育。又學校方面，也另有學生二十五萬人，施以特殊的專鬥敎育。各學校的普通學生團，也取消原有的「預備下士官士官團」的組織，而編入「陸海軍見習士官團一。敎育部管轄下的男女學生八十萬人，爲使學習一般工塲及軍需工塲的專門技術，施以六個月期間的訓練。一面，美國陸海軍並各在大學專門學校內，設置直屬的學校，這些學校內的學生團體是各自獨立的，用自編的敎科書，訂立獨自的校規，專門學校以上的學生，則跟他們學習，因爲尙未受過軍事訓練，所以很費事。</p>
<p>例如北卡洛列那大學，把二十二所宿舍中的十所，以及體育設備，食堂，醫務室，並其他許多設備，都供給海軍，以備訓練附設於該校內的預備飛行學校的一千五百名候補生之用。又印第安那大學內，於去年七月，開設海軍訓練所，徵　兵員六百名。並同數的海軍徵用婦人，使受敎育，達托瑪斯大學被海軍徵發敎室十三，運動塲的集會所，並寄宿舍五所，以備他校選手來校比賽時寄宿之用。</p>
<p>以上是海軍方面。至於陸軍，亦用同樣的方法，儘量利用各大學內的設備。</p>
<p>大學和專門學校的改革</p>
<p>現正在專門學校和中等學校肄業中十八歲十九歲的學生，因新徵兵法的規定，不能不離開學校，所以在費拉特爾費亞召開的美國大學專門學校聯盟會議中，爲使滿十八歲過於兵役資格的學生，得以利用專門學校及大學起見，　決設立「應召學生訓練團」約計劃，各校長一致認爲由於新計劃的規定，學生可不限於在學時才能受到敎育，根本的縮小髙等敎育制度，茶至於可以說消滅了髙等敎育制度。</p>
<p>因此，各專門學校，大學中，技術科學，數學，及其他各部門的研究，必須經陸海軍當局認爲必要時，始得敎授，完全改變了各學校的課程，以期適應總力戰的戰時體制。</p>
<p>這在高等教育的分野上所實現的根本改革，並將垂之於永久，爲過去四個半世紀以來美國髙等敎育上最根本而急激的變革，可以說是爲適應總力戰而施行的總括的改革。其改革的內容，除爲兵役年齡的學生，及軍需產業上的學生，準備特別的課程外；並在軍事當局的監督之下，對於體格的鍛鍊，亦加以特別注意。</p>
<p>北卡洛列那大學開設「戰時訓練料」對十六歲以上的學生，訓練「前綫及後方」的任務。又去秋爲髙級生開設「入營準備科」，　劃對十八·九的徵募兵，在戰時訓練科中，先　以一部分的國軍訓練</p>
<p>中等學校科目變更</p>
<p>全美的中等學校，爲適應戰時下的必要，而變更其課程，廢棄傳統的古典的科目，代以實用的科目，允以技術分野上各科目的變更最堪注意。各校令以航空學，電氣學，無綫電構造，並勞作，數學，物理學，化學等，爲主要課程，以其與航空有關。克里扶蘭市敎育局，最近通過中等學校課程的改編案，紐約市的中等學校高級生，以飛行準備講座，航空學，及入營準備育爲必修課</p>
<p>芝加哥各中等學校的課程也改變了，新設的飛行準備請座，航空學，自本年一月起，同成爲必修科；波斯頓各中等學校，也都以技術的訓練爲主，　本的變革其課程，而設立了應用數學，航空學，航空力學，氣象學，航海學等購座。洛桑才兩斯各校，也都開設「勝利講座」，作爲補習科目。</p>
<p>女學生的戰時教育</p>
<p>美國女子，今亦在政府及軍需工業中，擔任重要的職務。美國國內的女子大學，專門學校，茲亦適應戰時的需要，而修正其敎授的內容，許多有文學土學位的女子，現在重新回到學校，受幾個月的補修教育後，擔任各種特殊任務。因此，女子大學，專門學校，也都添設數學，物理，化學，及其他目前急需的諸科目，並獎勵女子接受技術的訓練。</p>
<p>精神教育貧困情形</p>
<p>在美國的敎育軍事化的反面，我們發見了精神敎育方面的貧乏。他們過於重視了物質主義，所以不知道精神敎育的重要，並且也缺乏理解其重要性的能力。但美國敎育界也有人注意到此點，而表示不滿。例如紐約市成人敎育會幹事維尼佛萊特。費許，在最這　市的成人敎育會十，演　美國史，出席的不過幾百分之一，爲之慨談不置。</p>
<p>教育界的混亂矛盾</p>
<p>美國敎育界現所逢到的矛盾，極爲深刻。第一，戰爭即將臨到犧牲學童的階段，紐約市教育協會會長瑪迦萊特·路易生，對此點很爲憂慮。上面已經說過，美國的學童，業已爲戰爭而犧牲了，紐約市的少年犯罪率，一九四二年度前半年，比一九四一年同期，增加了百分之十四，進因爲該市的教育預算削減了約近四百萬元，致不能發揮社會隔利設施的機能，而助長了少年犯罪率的上昇，故頗非離當局的近視政策。</p>
<p>第二，因新徵兵法實施後，學生數減少的結果，各大學的財政陷於非常困難的境地。瑪克愛特大學校　瑪卡西說：</p>
<p>「許多大學，若沒有政府的補助金，則不能進行」</p>
<p>第三，戰時下美國學敎育混亂的最大原因，在於政府沒有統一的教育政策。本來，政府各部門對於大學，專門學校有很大的影響，無計劃的實施各種政策，勢必相互發生矛盾，例如經濟學和統計學的敎授們，多被戰時生產計劃局，物價統制局，及其他官廳所拉去，因急事而被召至華盛頓的亦很多。因此，大學的敎育能力，不免顯着地低下，或被破壞：軍隊中或民間，遂不能獲得有十分學力的青年。（翔：聞）</p>

<h3>國際一週大事</h3>
<p>維希卅一日哈瓦斯社電　自一月二十四日至一月三十一日一週間、最惹人注意之事件、厥為東綫戰事之發展、及羅斯福與邱吉爾二氏之加薩勃朗加會議、茲分述如次、（一）以言戰局、過去一週間東綫各路均有激烈戰事、髙加索德軍仍預定計劃縮短防綫、頓河前綫並無重大變化、蘇軍正在伏朗尼慈以西發動新攻勢、至於斯達林城之德軍仍在賡績抵抗中、所有給養均用飛樣運輸、北非方面無重大變化、特利波里坦尼亞德軍現正與英軍作衛戰、　突尼西亞方面軸心軍及協約軍兩方均秣爲厲兵、重整部隊、準備大戰、太平洋及印度洋一帶日本空軍極為活躍、曾轟炸印度各軍事目標·澳洲達爾文港及新幾內亞之英美軍陣地、（二）以言加薩勃朗加會議、英美兩巨頭會談、始於一月十四日迄於一月二十四日，共歷十天、但此項消息直至二十六日始行宣布、同時法國分裂派領補季勞及特戈　二人、亦在該地舉行會議、（三）東亞方面、日本首相東條曾在貴族院發表演說、重申作戰到底、以完遂解放東亞之決心、並聲明日本決賦予東亞各國以獨立自主之權利、以建設東亞新秩序、（四）德國於一月三十日舉行希特勒元首秉政十週年紀念、德國各領袖均發表演說、重逃德軍已往之戰績、及作戰倒底搏取最後勝利之決心、同時德國並宣佈實行强迫勞役制度、男子自十六歲至六十五歲、女子自十七歲至四十五歲、均應服役、義國亦已動員女子一百廿四萬七千餘名、担任國內工作、俾男工得開往前綫作戰、近東方面關於土耳其之態度、曾發生種種謠言、準無論如何、該國絕不致改變初衷、仍將繼續其避免捲入戰爭漩渦之政策云</p>
<h3>華中經濟動向　羅致人才充實經委會　中日合作增強作戰力</h3>
<p>二月一日大陸新報</p>
<p>現在已經到了對英美決戰的第二個年頭，國府　應參戰，新中國也在這個時候開始前進，日本爲求實踐平等互惠，所以決定撤廢在華治外法權，交還租界，向內外表明對華政策的方途。預料華中的經濟政策，亦將跟着這條目標轉換，本年度華中經濟的應進途徑，在一月裏就有了明確的方向，現在再來把經濟關係的中要事情，的略舉幾點出來：</p>
<p>國府參加</p>
<p>國府在一月九日參戰之後，造成了大東亞戰爭以來華中經濟的最大轉機，這個新途徑，就是國府自動參戰，自己來決定中國應走方向，日本方面支持國府的參戰，改變在華政策，有了這兩種的關係，就產生了一個新的途徑。</p>
<p>前者是强化國府和實施自主經濟政策的意思，目標非常淸楚，國府在一月十三日的最髙國防會議上，通過全面改革機構，同月二十日的第二次最高國防會議上，又決定全國經濟委員會的新機構，新經濟委員會的名單裏頭，添加了華北經濟界巨　周作民，唐壽民，吳震修氏等七人，廿八日的第三次會議上，又添聘了錢大　，李權時等八位。</p>
<p>全國經濟委員會，此番聘請民間經濟人氏參加，這就是要使從來少接近的國府和經濟界密切的結合，徵詢經濟界的見解來做國府經濟的施政的參考。預備來做與實施調和的經濟統制，結果經濟界的代表者，都站於政府的立場，換一句話說；也就是站於統制的方面，今後循序該委員會的企劃，必能確立新經濟體制，順利的推進。</p>
<p>後者就是考慮討論華的新政策，以應付決戰時期的日本決心爲第一前提，美國爲挽救頽勢、在這一年裏頭傾力窮幹，那麽日本也不得不傾全力來撲滅他了。因爲這個關係，所以必須趕緊加强國府的政治力量，可以免餘後顧之憂，適應當前的需要，來實行華中經濟的轉換。</p>
<p>轉換政策的具體方策如何，雖然沒有明確的吿訴我們，但是由於以上種種的時代需求，它的方向當然是：「中國的事情歸中國處理」，因爲國府參戰，過去中日兩方在華的經濟上的隔膜，也完全除了，這是值得注目的一點。</p>
<p>糧食對策</p>
<p>駐滬日陸海軍當局及上海特別市政府，上月十一日發表佈吿，限制重嬰食料品的移動，自一月十三日起，一切重要食料品，非經止當手續，禁止搬入上海　區，或從淸鄉地區移動出口，當局所以採取這種措置，就是要肅淸上海食糧黑市塲和內地的勾結，安定產地的米價，促進收購、以便來應付這個嚴重的食料問題。自從這個佈吿發表以後，上海四周，固不待論，就是淸鄉區裏的米價，也逐步回小。因爲舊歷年關已近，農民需要現款，現在能够大量來收買，這是一個很好的機會辦法。</p>
<p>自本年一月初起，國府糧食部得到日本軍當局的有力援助，開始收購糧食，工作非常順利，正在積極推進之中。</p>
<p>統治物價</p>
<p>經濟統制的加强，因爲日方的決戰和國府的參戰，已經成了一個極緊要的問題，在這種情勢之中，工部局就採取二種辦法，先於一月二十三日發表佈告。加強統制辦法，規定一切製造商及批發商物品價格，不得超過一月二十三日的水準。從此零售價格的統制，也比過去厲害，又在一月二十七日佈吿限制紗布移運，這個辦法，目的在於防止不需上海大使館事務所許可而趁機移運的紗布投機交易，工部局施行這個辦法以後，那麽除了實在必需的移運之外，就沒有法子移運，所以紗布的限價，就容易維持了。（任譯）</p>

<h3>當局關注民食　決定增加配給數量　禁運後收購情形好轉　盤谷食米供本市需要　每人每月配給量將再加一·二公斤</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊、有關當局、爲增加上海之配給米數量而謀調節糧食之供需起見、刻在積極努力中、現屆舊曆年終、當局業經決定、最近即將上海地區華人配給米數量每月每人再增加一·二公斤（一·五市升）、查目前華人之配給米數量、每人每月計四·八公斤、此次增加一·二公斤後、則共計爲六公斤、至於所配給之麵粉、每月每人配給二·五公斤者、仍舊繼續不變、是故預料糧食之不足、今後當大爲和緩、按此次增加食米數量、蓋因自一月十三日實施禁止將大米私運至上海地區後、在內地農村之收買情形、業吿好轉、收買量大見增加、同時目下洋米之運入、至爲順利、但最近內地之收費、尙在逐步進展中此後對於一部份民衆所焦慮之民食不安、可逐漸消滅、預料食米之暗盤交易、亦當完全匿跡云、</p>

<h3>陳市長廣播演講</h3>
<p>（中央社滬訊）東亞聯盟中國總會上海分會爲慶祝南京總會成立二周年紀念、自昨一）起請本市各機關長官分別廣播演講、昨下午二時至二時半、請陳市長公博假上海電台播講東亞聯盟中國總會二週年紀念及其意義、茲錄誌廣播原詞如次、</p>
<p>各位同胞、今天是東亞聯盟中國總會成立兩週年紀念的日子、適値中國參戰其意義非常深遠、</p>
<p>首創東亞聯盟約思想的可以說是國父孫先生、他在民國十三年提倡的大亞洲主義、便是東亞聯盟思想的具體表現、孫先生檢討亞洲現勢、追溯過去光榮、知道東亞各民族、尤其是中日民族、有同生共死、同甘共苦的密切關係、所以東亞聯盟、可以說是歷史上神聖的產物、必然發生的、</p>
<p>在東亞地理上、歷史上如無日本便無中國、如無中國便無日本、國父孫先生　就昭告我們、因爲如果沒有日本的維新、成爲東亞的强國、中國早　被白色的英美帝國主義者瓜分了、英美所以不敢貿然瓜分中國、爲的是有領袖東亞的日本在、但是在另一方面、如果中國早被英美瓜分、那麽東亞的形勢早就改觀、東亞已整個入於英美　手，日本的維新　容易遭遇困難、英美必加以整個壓力於日本、所以在歷史上觀察、不論在政治上、軍事上、經濟上、文化上、早就決定東亞民族的聯盟、中日民族的親切合作中國希望日本以東亞民族領袖的地位來協助中國使中國强盛、來扣當東亞部份的責任、中國如果衰弱便使日本的責任加重、中國如果强盛、可以担當東亞解放的一部份責任、可以協助日本早使東亞解放成功、日本有識之士、也感到這偉大的識見所以協力贊助東亞聯盟、在歷史上觀察、日俄戰爭時中國的力量很微薄、抵抗不了帝俄向滿洲的侵略、日本以捍衛東亞實不容辭、便不惜犧牲向帝俄宣戰、如果當時中國有力量的話、便不勞日本如此犧牲、自己便可以驅逐帝俄的力量外出、這證明中國衰弱對日本有害、又如今日的大東亞戰爭、如果印度菲律賓緬甸馬來等民族自己有力量的話、大東亞戰爭早就成功勝利了、所以東亞聯盟希望東亞民族一律强盛、一律平等、各站本身崗位、努力分担東亞解放的任務、</p>
<p>剛才說過東亞聯盟約思想的提倡可以說國父孫先生是第一人、但是數十年來環境的演變、英美的挑撥使這思想不能發揮、現在東亞聯盟約思想日漸蓬勃、可以分爲三個時期說、</p>
<p>一、第一個時期、自七七事變後東亞聯盟思想是啟發時期、中日有識之士、竭力提倡東亞聯盟以淸除過去誤會、去實行協力合作平等提携、</p>
<p>二、第二個時期自一二八大東亞戰爭發動後、是東亞聯盟思想促進時期、日本以武力掃除英美在東亞的惡勢力、使東亞民族復歸於東亞、</p>
<p>三、第三個時期、自一月九日國府參戰、是東亞聯盟約實現時期、中國已拿出力量來參戰、實現東亞聯盟、此後東亞民族、自然隨之都拿出力量來實現東亞聯盟了、時間很匆速、說話很簡單、在慶祝東亞聯盟中國總會成立二週年紀念之餘、謹祝東亞聯盟早日實現、東亞民族早日解放、</p>
<h3>希望各界　少寄信</h3>
<p>上海郵政管理局、對於各地郵件、曾經積極設法疏通遞送、卒因各地水陸運輸尙未恢復原狀、以致遞送任何一種郵件、不無感受困難、有關方面希望各界减少投寄不必要之信件、旣可撙節紙張消耗、又可使郵政局不致有大宗郵件　積云、</p>
<h3>兩租界征發蔴袋　逾期沒收懲處　最後限期至二月十三日為止</h3>
<p>公共租界工部局及法租界公童局、上月中旬爲水順和將內地糧運滬曾分別出示佈吿，定自一月十八日起、依照所訂價格、收買空蔴袋、並限期送交兩租界征發辦事處、茲悉、兩租界當局對於征發蔴袋一節、以限期巳迫、除已請蔴袋貨主予以合作、懷遵當局意旨、迅將蔴袋送交，依價收買外、一面並將該限期延長至本年二月十三日爲止、倘逾此期限、仍未將空蔴袋送交征發辦事處者、決將各該貨主之貨熟償沒收、並對留存蔴袋貨主予以懲處、</p>
<h3>保富續意</h3>
<p>丁此時艱，瘡痍滿目，貧病之人，愁苦萬狀，而富有之家，亦覺時勢不定，尙無保障之方，今讀上海申報登戰，聶雲台先生所作保富法一文，大爲感動，不揣淺謬，引續其意，尙乞海內高明敎正之！　楊郁生</p>
<p>古人說：「爲富不仁」，又說：「善人是富」，這二句話，意思相反，而事實上，大家均承認二句都對。因富人之金錢從何而來，無非隨事業之繁熒，由大家身上或利息上累積所致，個人獨享其富，錦衣豐食，不肯布施，遂爲社會所嫉視。俗諺所謂「一家飽暖千家怨」。乃被視爲不仁。反之，某某富翁，眼看着同是人類，有種種苦厄。引起同情心，加以友助，或憑各自天良，不論多少，從自己腰包內掏出一筆錢，做點好事，題起名來，一律稱爲善士。均是富也，因其做人方法的不同，或被駡其不仁，或被譽爲善士，也有許多富翁，爲自己眞誠行善，儘管由人笑駡，好事我自爲之。</p>
<p>續西洋歷史，有好幾次戰爭，爲爭取自由；看中華民國成立後，有好幾次內戰，是一般軍閥政客們爭取財富。求富似爲大衆最大之目的，舊歷新正見面拜揖，先說恭喜發財。如進搢紳之家，廳堂中縣有福祿壽喜掛圖，以表吉慶，所謂福者希望能做大官可以發財；所謂祿者有俸祿不愁飢寒，，所謂壽者能享期願，長壽康寗；所謂喜者，兒孫滿堂，光前裕後，凡此種種，即是保富之理想圖，然千家萬戶，能實現此理想者有幾？即使做到此種理想境界，做了大官，享了大名，未必是福！每見有福之家，福益大而氣益多，做家長是受氣之長，張公九世同居，號爲百忍堂，忍字從刀從心，隱痛不宣，以忍氣面貌爲受　也。得綠亦不易，諺云；無功受祿，寢食難安。自己不能盡一分義務，即不能受一分利祿！受人之祿，代人受過，以勞力或血汗換得金錢，不足云祿也。壽之長短，不能依年齡計算，人不能立德立功立言，雖壽亦夭，如蹉跎歲月，身同頑石，老而不合潮流，徒被人誣爲壽頭而已。兒孫太多，在傳統上爲有後，在目前之艱苦生活，眞是罪累重重，如不加敎導，不能有益於社會，其罪孽不但延及祖考，每有賢明之父母及光榮之家庭，破敗於兒孫手中，欲保富而不能，良可慨也。</p>
<p>我嘗測騐般小學生們的心理，問他們讀書有何目的？他們均說：「爲將來掙錢」，錢是財富，雖是好東西，可以享福，然而未必是對的。我會問許多朋友，爲什麽叫子弟求學，也說讓他們將來可以掙錢致富，未免懷疑。憶我幼時束髮受學，敎師對我說：書中自有黄金屋，書中自有千鍾粟，這種敎訓，不合潮流，如今讀書之士，衣食不周，那有黄金屋？做官是公僕，尙愁升斗不繼，安有千鍾栗呢？讀聶先生的大文，縷述富貴世家盛敎事實，並引說中國的聖哲之訓，所謂、「福善禍淫」，「天道虧盈而益謙……」。乾卦說：「能利天下而不首所利」，需家說：「孝弟忠信禮義廉恥」八德，都是義務心重，權利心輕。洵是句句藥石，字字珠玉。要奉勸家畏們應以此意敎訓子弟，不必專從掙錢致富的路上着想，將來自可長保其富。更要奉勸敎育者曁敎師，從小學生們的天眞心地上，敎他們將來如何立品做人，纔是富國富家的百年大計呀！</p>
<p>孟子爲梁惠王曰：「王曰何以利吾國，大夫曰何以利吾家，士庶人日何以利吾身，上下交爭利而國危矣」。「秦始皇併吞六國，富有天下，自欲創萬世之業，築長城，求不死之藥。而始皇年僅五十即死於沙邱，國祚僅傳二世而亡。此國富的不可恃也　一部紅樓夢，縷述大家庭之興衰喜哀情感，此家富的不可恃也。耶蘇在聖經上說：「富人要登天國，比駱駝准針門尤難一：佛陀大智大慧，一部心經中有二十個無字，指示人們一切皆無，所謂無色聲香味觸法，就是斷絕富有　欲念，然後可以心無墨碍，無有恐怖遠離顚倒夢想，…能除一切苦。而老子哲學，竟說人之息，莫大乎有身，更視財富爲不足道；如此類說法，財富不是快樂幸福。</p>
<p>快樂幸福是內在的東西，而不是外表的，是個自覺的而不是客體激發的，快樂幸福全在自己心理上建造起來，必定在安貧樂道的生活中纔有鳶飛魚躍的情懷，即在在風暴雨的環境，亦有仁者不憂的態度，即在簞食瓢飲的貧苦中，仍有顏回不改其樂的意識。易卜生說得好：「財富可以買一切事物的外殼，而不能買其核實，它能給你食物而不能給你食慾，能給你醫藥，而不能給你健康，能給你朋友，而不能給你忠實，能給你整天的歡樂而不能給你安靜與興趣」，財富的性質，原來不過如此。如今時異勢遷，物資日缺，幣値變動，雖有金銀房屋田地，是否爲財富，尙須從新估量！</p>
<p>有幾位聰明朋友說：「眞正愛子弟，應該先敎他如何化錢，不敎他掙錢，不會化去，掙來也是徒然，會化錢於有益的途徑，慷慨助人，而不做吝嗇鬼守財奴，以致被人妬忌盜竊而吃虧，才是智戀。反之，如專　掙而不化，難免巧取豪奪，錢是活動的，不免腐侈浪費、傷身敗德，愛之適以害之」。所以古人說積財於子孫不如積　於子孫，際茲世變無定，富貴原如浮雲，做點好事，佈施救濟，也是投資，與其爲子孫作暫時享樂計，何如爲保國保家共謀百年計上算呢！能掙錢，能施捨，爲　並非不仁；富而挪大眼光，肯爲貧病同胞着想，共濟時艱，旣合一善人是富一之道，亦爲求快樂幸福之捷徑。</p>
<p>（附註）倉卒績叙，深愧淺謬，將來稍暇，擬撰「科學的保富法」以參證聶公所示，並不玄虛，希望經濟學家，保險學家，心理學家，生物學家，各抒宏見爲荷，鄙人通訊處聖。母院路蒲石路口友助醫社。　郁生</p>

<p>上年發生於馬路上之意外事件、致人死傷或損害財物者、合計三七三二起、比前年大見减少、此因汽車劇减之故、</p>
<p>禮和洋行增加棧租</p>
<p>禮和洋行各堆棧、爲增加棧租通吿谷業貨主云、逕啟者茲因物力維艱、開支驟增、目西歷一九四三年二月一日起、不得　改訂棧租、新價總棧每立方　中儲券五角、東棧每立方尺中儲券四角、至於原存敝棧之貨、一律照新價計算、</p>
<h3>今年上半年稅收　可望達到三萬元　各種稅收數額預計均有增加</h3>
<p>今年上半年之政府稅收總額、因最近關稅鹽稅收入之增加與統稅稅則之修正、可望達到三四〇·四七三·〇〇〇元之數、較去年同期將有顯著之增加、至於支出方面、今年上半年將達六億元之數、當局爲平衡收支起見對於稅制將設法加以修改、茲將今年上半年各種稅支預計額列後、（一）關稅七二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、（二）鹽稅三二·七〇〇·〇〇〇元、（三）統稅一八一·七一六·三五八元、（四）烟草稅二·一九一·六〇〇元、（五）印花稅二·一四〇·九〇〇元、（六）礦稅二·八〇四·一三〇元、（七）特稅一六·四六〇·〇〇〇元、（八）所得稅二〇·四〇〇·〇〇〇元、（九）移　稅五·四〇〇·〇〇〇元、（十）蠶絲附加稅四·六五〇·〇〇〇〇元、</p>

<h3>罐頭食品市況槪述</h3>
<p>— 華雲</p>
<p>公會竭力抑低黑市　春節後將繼續配給</p>
<p>進口貨罐頭食品，自大東亞戰爭以後，即經當局施行統制，除農產品水菒植物類，準許自由移動外，其他海產物如鱗介甲榖及禽獸肉類等，均須由公會轉向言管當局（大使館辦事處食料班）請求頒發移動許可證，方准移動，同時因存底不充，來源頹少，時有供不應求現象。而歐美貨又將絕跡，致價格迭升，無論何貨，均甚俏俐。同業及業外囤戶，又復多方搜購，高價疊見，向來無甚升降之罐頭食品市況，竟有日漲夜大之勢。</p>
<p>去春四月間，由友邦中支那日本輸入配給組合聯合會之協助，獲得各主管當局之核准，組織上海特別市瓶罐食品業同業公會，設會所於本埠九江路七五九號，成立以來，即首先力謀解決貨源供給，亟向關係當局極力疏通來源，一面並推行配給制度，登報公開配給，市况遂一度趨於穩定。嗣後因派貨數量太少，致粥少佾多，不敷分配。又激起黑市，發生暗盤，而一般不法同業，連絡有力者之合作，抬價搜羅，並　使第三國外商向虹口方面大量收買。致聯合會之供給數量？日形减少，遂連帶影響公會方面之配給數愛。蓋公會與友邦販賣組合之貨物，均由聯合會申請供給，虹口方面之日本罐頭商，因防止轉售囤積，不售與華商，而一般不法投機同業，竟利用外籍掮客，向共轉購，以遂投囤之慾望，而彼等落得髙抬價目，坐收厚利。俾一方面再向組合請求配給，以致聯合會供給日商數量增加，造成存底日缺的恐慌。基於上述因素，於是刺激黑市，日創空前紀錄之暗盤。例如三打裝五五〇瓦合同片菠羅，事變前門售每聽僅法幣三角餘，而目前黑市每箱竟術中儲券六白餘元，尙難購得。與公會配給價每箱僅二百十二元一角比較，相差達四百餘元之巨。誠爲驚人之創舉。聞公會方面已要求聯合會禁止轉售私貨，通吿各友邦組合員。</p>
<p>公會自成立以來，雖僅八月餘，然盡其最大努力，公開配給貨物，已有四期。最近第五期配給貨，已商得聯合會之同意，供給大批貨物。爲謀協助當局抑低價格，消滅黑市起見，決將於春節後公開配給，現正硏究改善配給辦法，至於價目仍無變動，此後黑市交易，恐將遭受嚴東打擊。目下雖屆廢曆年終，市况仍甚堅俏，茲將最近市價，分列於左：</p>
<p>以止均係公定標準品，故不論牌子，售價一律。</p>
<h3>甲組食油零售店　昨起繼續售油兩天　計口授油尙無確定</h3>
<p>上海食油同業　發處爲應付舊歷年節市民食油需要、經向軍配當局購就食油約二千担、配給全市甲組食油零售店、於昨（一日）起繼續出售食油兩天、至今（二日）止悉數售罄、至於今後食油是否仍繼續分甲乙兩組售油、或實施計口授油、目前尙無確定、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>談分工合作的原理</h3>
<p>— 耶魯</p>
<p>在自由談看到春秋先生的一篇「工作和報酬」後，我想站在職業青年的地位，發表一些感想。的確在各種工商機關裏，工作和報酬的不相稱，是普遍的事實，春秋先生已有具體的記述，我不想加以補充。不過，工作和報酬的不合理，使我連想到「分工與合作」的問題起來。</p>
<p>凡是具有相當親模的事業裏，有若上對內對外的部份的設立，母一部份，有主持的人，有辦事的人，權限有別，職守有分，這樣在工作性質上的區別，就是所謂「分工」。不論處理例行公事，或是連帶性的事情，從開始到完成，有一定的步驟，在事的過程中，部份與部份之間，人員與人員之間，都必須在文字上或口頭上經過關係，這樣互相的接觸，協力的形態，就是所謂「合作」。總之，在任何事業裏面，有分工合作的條例，而從業者有同一的目標，所謂異曲同工」，「殊途同歸」，可以代表「分工合作」的具體說明。</p>
<p>上面所舉，僅是「分工合作」的輪廓，其實分析起來，分工是有關於技術的問題，合作是有關於人事的問題。技術是分工的前提，人事是合作的前提。但是技術也離不了人事，人事也離不了技術，兩者是相因而成的。必須技術上沒有問題，人事上處置得宜，才能充分達到分工合作的效果。</p>
<p>何謂分工是技術問題，說得普通一點，就是「用人」的問題。因爲一種事業裏面，有許多性質不同的工作，於是在用人方面有甄別技術的必要，技術甄別之後，着手分工。不過分工的開始，相當困難的是沒有成規可循，這就需要在以後愼重考慮到「因事擇人」，「因人探事」的問題，務使各項人才用得共當而後已。人才用得其當，就合於分工的原則，那末由於「報酬和工作不相稱」以及「忙的人太忙，閒的人太閒」等等情形，以致有碍於業務者，也該酌定公允的辦法來解決。</p>
<p>何謂合作是人事問題，因爲任何事業，第一要上下通力合作，而合作的主要條件，在於人事。人事管理得宜，可免許多或明或暗的糾粉，使大家有合作的眞誠，而產生互相合作的自動精神。不過合作這一件事，在上者固然要有合理化的人事管理的機構，但是從業者却也要具有奉公守職的德性。有許多工商業中的從業者，不了解合作是應盡的莪務，對於職務非常隨便，這樣如果不致於影響大局，不致於加累於旁的同事，倒也罷了，否則爲了個人的不負貴任，缺乏與人合作的美德，沒有服務上應有的紀律，就往往容易使得整個專業蒙受直接間接的損失。</p>
<p>凡百事業的進行，阻碍自然難免，不過，分工合作是不可漠視而是任何事業中的重要問題，所以筆者不揣譾陋，述其梗概，甚望工商業的賢明領袖，以及優秀的從業者共同努力。</p>
<h3>「秋海棠」觀感</h3>
<p>— 親民</p>
<p>「秋海棠」戲是相常的長，在戲院里足足的坐了四點又二十分鐘的時間。在看戲的中間，我時時注意到了周圍觀衆的表情，他們的歎息和眼淚。這很可以說明這戲是怎樣的抓住了觀衆的心弦。但是在我，却似乎僅不過在溫習一個熟悉了的故事。幼年我常常喜歡跑游藝塲，一個軍閥，一個伶人，一個受壓迫的姨太太，和一個貪諂奸險壞透了的馬弁，再加上一番悲歡離合的安排，於是一齣悲慘纏綿扣人心弦的戲劇便構成了。那時候，我確也曾被騙過不少的眼淚，不過，只要走出了戲院的門口，揩乾了眼淚，就什麽都忘了，回家以後便再也不會去想它一想的。這次「秋海棠」的演出說起來也不過如是而已，所不同的，「秋海棠」是有着更緊密的結構，和經過了正式的排練。所以在水準上是超過於那些游藝場的文明戲，同時在打動觀衆這一點也就發揮着更大的力量了！</p>
<p>總之，從這一次演出，我們可以看到無論劇本或導演都是非常注意於觀衆的反應的。像第三幕季兆雄吿發秋海棠與羅湘綺的關係，當塲的逼，哭，打等等都足以使觀衆感到非常的激動和緊張，而末後的重逢和大團圓又是最最迎合小市民的心理的。我佩服「秋海棠」的作者和導演的懂得觀衆的心理，而且獲得了成功；但是我也可惜他們的成功僅僅是觀衆數字上的成功，他們確實是把那些常跑游藝塲新世界的觀衆吸引到卡爾登來了。可是這樣的吸引，是不是提髙呢？我想就是最最講求生意眼的話劇導演和演員們，他們也不能不承認話劇是應該包含有敎育觀衆，提高觀衆水準的意義吧！那麽這次「秋海棠」的演出對於話劇的前途到底會不會有什麽幫助呢？它會不會使得如今的話劇也會像前期的愛美劇那樣走上了沒落的道路呢？我想，這些都是値得我們老慮一下的問題。</p>
<p>說到演員，石揮的秋海棠在前半段還不够那瀟洒的勁兒，後半段比較的是他可以發揮演技的戲，雖然受了劇本的限制，但演技在大體上，是渾厚老練的。沈敏的戲，比以前略見進步，羅湘綺的端重雍容的風度，她相當能表現了出來。不過她讀臺詞的那一貫平板的調子，却需要改一下。英子尙努力，但她的了解梅寳那個角色，我以爲是不大正確的，梅實應該有兩車的性格，一方面染着女學生的活潑作風，一方面，因爲出身，環境等等原因，她應該是早熟而幽怨的，而英子的演出，是把她演得太「硬」了，不够激起人的同情。</p>
<h3>讀「二十四孝圖」　（六）</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>——給我的女兒</p>
<p>但是旣然這樣，何以古往今來天下之人，都很少對於那些父母加以任何貶詞，倒只在勸兒女盡孝呢？本來我們有些不可解的事，比如一個女人遇見强暴，在强暴那方面的公式是不免淫心頓起，以致生出許多事來。事後的評論家們總不責備强暴，只問這女人屈服了沒有，以定題詩作賦來頌揚或是不齒於人類來懲罰。但是那是强暴，對於强暴，實在也很少理講倒也情有可原，何以對父母的塲合也取同樣的態度呢？難道父母那樣殘忍苛酷，虐待兒女，還不能算世道人心之隱憂麽？父母不好，兒女年齡和智力都有限，不能逃出家庭的天羅地網，已經是件悲慘的事；編故事的還拿這來說敎，勸人盡孝來回答簡値有意勸孩子們向暴力屈服，少成若天性，習慣成自然，這樣童而習之，長大了也定是慣於向强權屈膝的柔順的奴才。這也許正是編故事的人們的本意，因爲他與皇帝闊人之流是有利的。不過中國人能够做皇帝闊人，外國人也能來中國做皇帝闊人。有人說中國人民族觀念薄弱工於媚外等等，其實也不盡然，外國勢力能到中國來，不用說，總是强權，對强權屈服旣早已習慣？也就無暇分什麼中國的或外國的了。如果不嫌扯得太遠，就說那些髙明的故事，和今天漢奸順民之產生有多少關係，恐怕也不算過分的深文。</p>
<p>「吳處文錄」有好多年沒有翻了，手邊又無書，就前些年看的印象說，那裏面關於孝的論列，大致是可同意的。魯迅在「魏晋風度和藥及酒的關係」里所說的「孝治天下」的道理，也很精闢。不妨向讀者推薦。至於我呢，我覺得旣然家庭制度還存在，社會的變革又不是一天兩天就可完工，家庭經濟操在父母手裏，父母大概又都愛兒女的，就今天說，把我們的民族國家的未來主人翁們，付托在別人手裏，都不比比托在他們各自的父母手裏更爲適宜。</p>
<p>現在的學者敎授們有一種妙論，說孝是靑年文化，詳論少見，不大理解是什麽道理。孝自然都是青年的事情，可是如果二十四孝里面的一些心靈不健全的創作看來，孝似乎不是靑年文化，倒是使靑年受苦受難的文化而發這種妙論的先生們自己早已不是靑年，而且髙高地坐在什麼交椅上指導靑年，受靑年的朝拜的了。這也就不難頴悟出他們話里面的正確性的多少來（酬移濟貧金）</p>
<h3>「一心一德」和「貫澈始終」</h3>
<p>— 隽灝</p>
<p>「一心一德」可以用一專心」來代替，「貫澈始終」可以用一恒心」來代督。本來，一樣做一件事，爲什麼他做出來有白分之百的成績；而我却老不及他，甚至於絲毫無成。難道他的成功，是有着神秘性的仙法？或者他自有獨特的天才不成？其實，他是一個人，我也是一個人；他生的是五官四肢，我也沒有短少了任何一樣。他之所以成功，實在是憑了他怎樣知道「專心一致」和「貫澈始終」啊。</p>
<p>要專心一致必須先從堅毅沉着做起，堅毅是在意志方園的修養，沉着是在行動方面的修養。在這兩方面修養有素以後，才可以進入專心一致的境界。因爲成功的道路上，不但是滿佈了蔓籐荊棘，而且還多着光怪陸離迷人耳目的種種誘惑，這種誘惑，時時刻刻會使你的意志動搖，使你對本來的目標發生懷疑。那時你一脚便走入了歧途，你那堅毅的意志和沉着的行動，便立刻會和你分手。沒有堅毅的意志和沉着的行動，便談不到專心。終於使你一籌莫展，眼見得別人靑雲直上，自己還祗是名落孫山</p>
<p>貫澈始終就是有恒，關於作事貴乎有恒的好處，不知有多少文章，爲它而申論過了。不過恒心的修養，確乎也不是一件容易的事。常常聽得人說：某人作事雖好，可惜沒有恒心。的確，世界上虎頭蛇尾的人，實在太多了；而且凡是虎頭蛇尾有始無終的人，斷然不會在工作上成就一絲半毫，更談不到什麽豐功偉績了。貫澈始終的先決條件究竟是什麽呢？一方面要做到不受環境的支配；一方面再去向一個目標埋頭邁進。其間最須要刻苦耐勞的精神以及勇猛精進的姿態。有了刻苦耐勞的精神，才能有一個千鍊百錘的體魄，從而克服環境以至於支配環境；有了勇猛精進的姿態，才能有苦幹硬幹的情緒，從而披荊斬棘，向光明的前途邁進。</p>
<h3>萬世師表</h3>
<p>— James　Hilton著　依今譯</p>
<p>（十）（一）</p>
<p>突然，一速串的思想，洶湧而來，緊緊地壓着，以致吉普斯開不出口，只好對自己回答着。這些考試與檢定等等—牠們有些什麽關係呢？這一切效能與現代化—任何一方面又有什麼關係呢？拉爾斯頓在　勃洛　菲爾德常作一個工廠那樣管理着—這工廠要製造出以金錢與機器爲根據的勢利文化。</p>
<p>舊時故家以及廣大田畝，其種種縉紳派的傳統，都在變化着，無疑，牠們是必須變化的；不過拉爾斯頓並不將牠們擴大成爲眞正的民主政治，將貴族與賤民一槪包括在內，却使牠們狹窄起來只成爲一本厚厚的銀行帳簿。在勃洛克菲爾德從來就沒有過這樣多的富家子弟演講日的園遊會就好像阿斯考特（Ascot）。拉爾斯在倫敦各俱樂部中遇到道些富翁，對他們誘說着，勃洛克菲爾德恰正是前進的學校；旣然他們不能用無錢買到進入伊東（Eton）或哈羅夢，他們就貪婪地呑下了，這個香餌其中有些是異乎尋常的像伙—雖然其他都很正常。財政家，公司創辦人，丸藥製造商。其中有一個，每星期給他的兒子五鎊，作爲零用錢。鄙陋……誇誕……尙代一切消耗的腐敗與成熟。……有一次，吉普斯說了一個笑話，這笑話是有關於一個名叫伊撒克斯坦因（Isaaestein）的學生的名字及其祖先的，因此他招到了麻煩。那個學生寫信回家說到這話，老伊撒克斯坦因就寫一封發怒的信給拉爾斯頓。暴躁，沒有出默之感，沒有調劑之感（Sensef　proportion）—這就是這些新傢伙的一切。……沒有調劑之感。尤其重於一切事情的，就是調劑之感，這才是勃洛克菲爾德所應該敎授的東西　不必這樣多的拉丁文或希臘文，或化學，或算學。你總不能將考卷分給他們，給他們檢定證書，就可以試騐出這種調劑之感來……（二十八）</p>

<h3>"Luxury is the Enemy" – A Re-Discussion on Wartime Consumption Economy</h3>
<p>Modern warfare is total war. It must concentrate all the people's strength to provide to the government embraced by the people, so that it can make appropriate deployment and strive for the victory of the war. The country that concentrates the most massive and substantial power and applies it most appropriately has the greatest certainty of victory. Conversely, if a country cannot gather all the mental, material, and human resources of the whole country, or intentionally or unintentionally consumes mental, human, and material resources in meaningless ways, then this country will suffer defeat. Therefore, on the one hand, there must be a strong government embraced by the whole people for the appropriate application of national power, and no wasteful consumption should be allowed. On the other hand, it is even more necessary to require the people of the whole country to absolutely avoid unnecessary consumption of human and material resources and absolutely prohibit any luxury during wartime.</p>
<p>"Luxury is the enemy" is a most popular slogan in Japan after the war. Because the luxury of national life will inevitably excessively consume the country's human and material resources, reduce the proportion in the total war against the enemy in modern warfare, and reduce the factors for the country to defeat the enemy, whether you intend it or not, the result will be helping the enemy. Therefore, use the slogan "Luxury is the Enemy" to raise the vigilance of the national people, everyone should strive to refrain from luxury, economical consumption, so that the country can save more human and material resources to fight the enemy and strive for the final victory. In fact, since the Sino-Japanese Incident, Japan has already implemented an economy policy with concerted efforts from top to bottom, and the national life has met wartime standards. All aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation are within the scope of government regulations, showing the special characteristics of wartime life. The consumption of the general public is subject to the control and guidance of the government, and several major foods, clothing materials, and daily necessities have long implemented a rationing and ticket system. Even housing and transportation (vehicles and traffic) are under strict control. Recently, in order to adapt to the prolongation of the war, accumulate more human and material resources, in order to create the power to overcome the enemy, and promote the "long-term war" to end in a short period of time, a universal economy movement has been further implemented. For example, lunch banquets are limited to 2.5 yuan per guest, and dinner banquets are limited to 5 yuan, both for the government and the public. For example, the paper used by primary school students is also limited every week. For example, the tickets issued by the government to the people for the purchase of consumer goods will be reduced even more this year, and the tickets required to be paid when purchasing goods will be increased, and the government will use planned and organized power to promote the economy movement. Although it increases the inconvenience of the people on the surface, its purpose is to require everyone to endure temporary inconvenience in order to shorten the war time and win victory as soon as possible. In fact, this method of prohibiting luxury and implementing economy has already been implemented by the enemy countries of Britain and the United States, which have always been known for the luxury of their national life, and have already implemented a strict consumption restriction policy. For example, in terms of clothing, the British people are subject to strict control in the purchase of clothing and clothing materials. Everyone must first go through registration procedures to obtain a certificate, which contains a total of sixty-six tickets. Generally, it takes twenty-two tickets to make a suit, and it takes five tickets to buy a pair of leather shoes, and it also takes two tickets for a tie. The government restricts you to spend only sixty-six tickets a year, and when the tickets are used up, you can't buy anything to wear even if you have money. In terms of food, the purchase of bread, milk, butter, and other foods is subject to designated shops and strict restrictions. Sometimes you can only buy beef or mutton once a week. In the past, there were several dishes for a meal, but now one soup, one dish, and a snack are popular. In terms of housing, in the past, one family lived alone, but now they are all designated by the government, and four or five families live together. For example, the source of paper in Britain has always been dependent on Canada and Norway. During the war, the source of wool was reduced due to shipping relations. Therefore, the British government launched a campaign to collect waste paper. Now, when you buy things in British stores, there is no paper to wrap them. For example, if you buy a pair of leather shoes, you can only hold them in your hands when you come out of the store. The official documents mailed by government agencies are all placed in old envelopes. One envelope is used seven or eight times, and at least three or four times. On the contrary, in our country, although there are many people who advocate economy, it is still very common to indulge in luxury and squander at will.</p>
<p>During wartime, the government should vigorously promote economy for very obvious reasons. For daily necessities such as clothing materials and food, of which our country does not produce enough and whose consumption will increase, there should be reasonable restrictions to seek a balance between supply and demand in order to achieve the goal of stabilizing prices. Even non-daily necessities and high-priced consumer goods, commonly known as luxury goods, must also be paid attention to, because seeking a superior and comfortable life is one of human desires. As long as there are delicious and fun things to get, people always want to get their hands on them. In order to satisfy this desire, those without money want to get money, and those with money want to get more money, and the trend of speculation is prevalent for a while. The surge in prices and the size of society cannot be ignored. Therefore, the restriction on non-essential goods or luxury goods and the restriction on improper entertainment places are problems that must be considered at present. We believe that as long as there is a comprehensive plan, careful consideration, and reasonable methods, then the result of prohibiting luxury and restricting consumer goods can not only reduce consumption and save materials and human resources for the country and society in a passive way, but also increase the people's proper working hours and productivity in an active way, so that the society can get on the right track.</p>
<p>Consumption economy and strict prohibition of luxury are not only necessary for the new environment of participating in the war, but also indispensable for peaceful nation-building. However, in consumption economy and strict prohibition of luxury, the most important thing is still the people's automatic attention and the full display of the power of social sanctions. Therefore, on the one hand, we expect the government to set comprehensive and reasonable methods as soon as possible, and on the other hand, we expect the efforts of all aspects of society, from the government to the people, to jointly eliminate our first enemy – luxury? Here, the exemplary role of political workers is of the first significance. And what the authorities and social leaders should pay special attention to is: the target of our strict prohibition of luxury and economical consumption today refers to those wealthy and powerful social components, not the common people. To be honest, most of the common people today are struggling in cold and poverty. They can't talk about luxury, let alone economy. If all prohibitions and restrictions only revolve around the common people, it will be ineffective.</p>
<h3>Battle of Rennell Island: Great Battle Achievements of Japanese Air Force; Five Enemy Warships Sunk, Two Severely Damaged</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st, Domei News Agency – The Japanese Imperial General Headquarters announced this morning at 10 o'clock, "The Japanese naval air force discovered a large enemy fleet southeast of Rennell Island at the southern end of the Solomon Islands on the evening of January 29th and immediately bombed it. At that time, the weather was bad, and the enemy ships were caught off guard and fled south immediately. However, on January 30th, the Japanese naval air force made a daytime attack on it again, giving it a fatal blow. The enemy's counterattack attempt failed because it was controlled first. As of now, the battle results that have been ascertained are as follows: Two enemy battleships and three cruisers were sunk, one battleship and one cruiser were damaged, and three aircraft were shot down. Our losses include seven aircraft that were self-destructed and three others that did not return. (Note: This naval battle is called the Battle of Rennell Island)"</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st, Domei News Agency – According to well-informed sources here, the Japanese navy has sunk or damaged 132 enemy warships and transport ships in the Solomon Islands waters alone, including 10 battleships, 8 aircraft carriers, 40 cruisers, and 36 destroyers, and shot down 910 enemy aircraft. Japanese losses include one battleship and 41 other ships sunk, 224 aircraft either self-destructed on targets or did not return, and 31 damaged.</p>
<p>Naval Minister Shimada Reports on War Situation</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st, Central News Agency – Naval Minister Shimada reported on the new naval battles in the Solomon Islands area at a meeting of the House of Peers on the 1st, explaining the war situation as follows: "On January 29th, the Imperial Navy Air Force discovered a powerful enemy fleet composed of battleships, cruisers, and destroyers in the sea east of Rennell Island at the southern end of the Solomon Islands. This battle occurred because the enemy planned to launch a counterattack against our army in the Solomon Islands and eastern New Guinea. The enemy's attempt has completely failed. The battle results of the Battle of Rennell Island that have been ascertained so far are: Two enemy battleships and three cruisers were sunk, one enemy battleship and one giant cruiser were destroyed, and three enemy fighter planes were shot down. Our naval air force braved the bad weather and carried out fierce attacks, instantly sinking one battleship and two cruisers, and other ships also suffered considerable damage. The enemy then attempted to flee south, but our troops pursued and attacked them. On the 30th, powerful air forces were again used to carry out a powerful daytime raid on the enemy, sinking one more enemy battleship and one cruiser. Here, I would like to add that in the battle on the 29th, the commander of our attack team braved the fierce enemy defensive fire and fought bravely. After launching a torpedo at an enemy battleship, he was unfortunately hit by an enemy shell. Knowing that he could not return to base, he took the bridge of the enemy battleship as his target and carried out a surprise self-destruction, finally sinking the ship. After receiving the report from friendly aircraft, the entire army was extremely moved."</p>
<h3>Australia Feels Seriously Threatened</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 1st, Central News Agency – A telegram from Sydney says that Australian Army Minister Spender delivered a broadcast speech to the entire Australian people on the 30th, saying that the Japanese army's actions in the Southwest Pacific are increasing the threat to Australia day by day. At this time, in addition to the timely defense by the American and Australian armies, the people</p>
<p>Lisbon, 1st, Central News Agency – A telegram from Canberra says that Australian Air Force Minister Drakeford warned the Australian people on the 31st, pointing out that the Japanese air force in the Solomon Islands is increasing its threat day by day. The general idea is that Japan will definitely do its best to seize control of the air over the Solomon Islands and the Emperor's aspect. Therefore, the activity of the Japanese air force will definitely increase day by day.</p>
<h3>Trends in Japanese Politics; Forming a "War First" Doctrine; Government and People Jointly Seek to Achieve the Goal</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st, Central News Agency Special Telegram – Under the Greater East Asia War, Japan must devote itself to enhancing its combat power and expanding production in order to achieve its goals. The goal of Japanese political trends is also to unify and concentrate political power in order to establish the basic conditions for implementing policies. In the past, all aspects of Japanese domestic politics, economy, culture, and national life were full of the remaining poison of liberalism, and they should be thoroughly attended to first. From this, establish a new worldview and new order produced by the Japanese people from their awakening, hoping to truly reform East Asia and even the world with the belief, and seek lasting world peace. At present, the first goal of implementing this concept is to complete the Greater East Asia War and destroy the Anglo-Americans who are delusional to maintain the old order. However, since the Greater East Asia War has a trend of long-term war, a huge consumption is inevitable. Therefore, a large increase in production is also necessary. In the past, the situation in which politics was the main and war was the auxiliary has turned to the trend in which war is the main and politics is the auxiliary. Therefore, the domestic war-winning system must be further strengthened. After the start of the war, the Japanese government immediately began to reform the administrative organs, such as preparing for the implementation of administrative simplification, the unification of domestic and foreign administration, and the establishment of the Greater East Asia Province. At the same time, all policies focused on enhancing production, such as strengthening the control association, reorganizing small and medium-sized businesses and industries, improving financial and capital institutions, and establishing centralized control of all materials, transportation funds, and labor, working hard, operating methods, etc. in order to enhance production. Recently, in order to obtain the expected results of enhancing combat power, it has also promulgated wartime administrative special cases and wartime administrative special cases bills to seek to enhance the unity of political power. This trend in the war and political aspects is enough to show that war has a priority. For example, in the wartime administrative special law bill, it is stipulated that the prime minister of the administrative minister has the authority to command the cabinet members who are also administrative ministers. Therefore, the so-called political and other first system in the past has been difficult to achieve, and the fact of war first has been formed. Therefore, today's Japanese political trend can be said to have focused on completing the war. At the same time, the parliament itself will have major changes and developments as a result, which is self-evident. Tracing the development of the Japanese parliamentary character, there was a trend of change when the Sino-Japanese Incident occurred, because although the parliament at that time was a national political participation organ stipulated by the constitution, it was actually completely controlled by various political parties. The Seiyukai and Minseito were the most prominent of these. The parties fought each other for rights and political strategies. By the time the Sino-Japanese Incident occurred, Japan deeply felt the need to strengthen the domestic political system. Therefore, in the political aspect, it first changed the past style of party politics and faction control, such as the Hirota Cabinet, the Abe Cabinet, and the Konoe Cabinet, etc., which used the comprehensive strength of various parties and factions and the balance of various forces to exert their ability in politics. Abe, the president of the Seiyukai, once elaborated on the attitude that the parliament, the people, and the government should take towards the implementation of established national policies, saying that all members should abandon partisan prejudices, work together in harmony, and that the parliament's responsibility is neither to follow the government without a direction, nor to make a temporary compromise with the government, but to correct what the government should correct and suggest what should be suggested based on the lofty national position. In particular, it is necessary to deeply understand the situation and complete the mission, that is, the members and the government are in a position of sincerity and encouragement. Regarding the implementation of established policies, we must not fail to urge the government and cooperate with it. Therefore, the purpose of this parliament transforming from a wartime parliament into a decisive battle parliament is to actively enhance combat power in the war and to prepare the domestic system as a result. The Japanese government this time submitted various important bills and budget bills to the parliament, so as to explain to the world the Japanese government's policy of implementing the war and stimulate the national's will to fight. The atmosphere of the parliamentary side concentrating the total strength of the country to actively cooperate with the government is also extremely strong. Moreover, before the parliament meeting, a large number of members cooperated in planning various administrative policies in the capacity of members of various provinces. Another group of members organized a combat power enhancement commando team and widely adopted the opinions of local officials and people in the parliament. During the recess period, they also actively cooperated in enhancing combat power and wartime administration. The government's proposed bills were first carefully reviewed by representatives carefully selected by all members. At the time of the meeting, the principle of focusing on key points was adopted. All these situations were unprecedented. Therefore, today's Japanese people, government, and parliament have united as one, determined with the belief of sure victory, to overcome all difficulties and move forward bravely. At the same time, the parliament also responded to this, regardless of party affiliation, and members are still representatives of the people, but also representatives of various interest groups. In terms of the relationship between the government and the parliament, because the positions of the two are different, disagreements are inevitable. However, the parliament is the representative of the people and should supervise the government. This trend has completely changed in the Japanese parliament after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and the true character of the Japanese parliament has been established accordingly.</p>

<h3>Germany Completes All Preparations; Will Expand Submarine Warfare; Defending Against Submarines Becomes a Difficult Problem for Britain and the United States; Convoy System Proves to Have Little Effect</h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st, Huitong News Agency – German Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Dönitz lectured his subordinates yesterday, saying that he was determined to engage in submarine warfare with all his strength and expand it to a wide range. Also, his special flag emblem has been hung on the submarine command headquarters since yesterday.</p>
<p>Geneva, Switzerland, 31st, Havas News Agency – Submarine warfare is still the focus of attention for military and political circles in Britain and the United States. According to news from London, the convoy system has completely failed due to the lack of thorough preparation for preventing submarine activities. It is found that during the First World War, the British side designed several defense methods in order to stop the activities of German submarines. According to Churchill (then Minister of the Navy), Germany was almost completely subdued at a certain period. The destroyer fleet was used to drive away submarines, and the hydroelectric network was also laid, and the scope of the network was expanded to the English Channel. "Q ships" (disguised submarine destroyers) also joined the service. However, the only effective way to protect ocean transportation was to protect shipping with warships. Under strict protection, merchant fleets often took circuitous sea routes. At the end of the First World War, 99% of convoyed merchant ships were able to reach their destinations. By this time, the situation has become more and more difficult. Submarines operating in groups have been able to break through the convoy defense. Therefore, the convoy system is very costly and has very little effect. Military experts believe that the convoy system has the following difficulties: (1) Protecting merchant fleets requires a large number of warships. These warships may be more useful elsewhere. (2) The speed of the convoy is based on the slowest ship. Therefore, each voyage is greatly extended. (3) Each convoy must gather at certain ports on specific dates. As a result, merchant ships full of goods are waiting in vain and must be detoured to reach the concentration point, which is more complicated. (4) The destination of the convoys often has no pier facilities, and unloading is extremely difficult. After the merchant ships arrive, they have to stay for many days, and sometimes it takes weeks to unload the goods continuously. Sometimes, even during the unloading period, they are still threatened by aerial bombing. All these points were experienced during the last war, but this time the situation is even more serious. The position of Britain and the United States is also more difficult than in 1918. The sea lanes of Britain and the United States have been completely deprived, and the losses they have suffered have been extremely heavy. Moreover, the sea lanes from North America to Britain and then from Britain via Cape Town to North Africa are extremely long. Britain now not only has to deal with the crisis of German submarines in the Atlantic Ocean, but also has to take into account the activities of Japanese submarines in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, making it feel overwhelmed. Since Admiral Dönitz took office as commander of the German fleet, he has proved that Germany intends to expand submarine warfare. Therefore, London will become more and more uneasy about this.</p>
<h3>Allied Ships Sunk in January Reached Sixty-Three</h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st, Domei News Agency – According to an announcement here today, German submarines sank a total of sixty-three Allied ships in January, totaling 408,000 tons. Another ten ships were hit by torpedoes or also sank, but it has not been confirmed.</p>
<p>Berlin, 1st, Huitong News Agency – According to the latest detailed report received, as a result of the Axis army's attack on the enemy convoy off the coast of Algiers on January 29th, twelve enemy ships were sunk, including seven merchant ships totaling 35,000 tons and five British destroyers. The merchant ships were loaded with war equipment to supply North Africa. It is said that among the British destroyers that were sunk, two were sunk by one Italian submarine.</p>
<h3>Ambrogio Succeeds as Italian Chief of General Staff; Six German Generals Promoted</h3>
<p>Rome, Allied News Agency, 1st - According to an official announcement here yesterday, Italian Chief of the General Staff, General Cavallero, submitted his resignation, which was approved. His vacant position will be filled by Army Chief of Staff, General Ambrogio. General Rossi, commander of the Sixth Army Corps, has been appointed as Army Chief of Staff.</p>
<p>Rome, Transocean News Agency, 1st - The newly appointed Italian Chief of the General Staff, General Ambrogio, was born in northern Italy and is 63 years old this year. During the Italo-Turkish War, he served as a captain. From 1915 to 1918, he served in the headquarters of the Italian Army's 3rd Cavalry Division. He was then transferred to serve as the commander of the Savoia Cavalry Brigade and deputy principal of the Pinerolo Cavalry School. From 1928 to 1932, Ambrogio served as the Inspector-General of Mechanized Units. In 1938, he was appointed as commander of the Italian Army's Second Army Corps and has been credited with meritorious service in Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Berlin, Transocean News Agency, 1st - Führer Hitler today promoted German Generals Kleist, Weichs, and Busch to the rank of Colonel General.</p>
<p>Berlin, Transocean News Agency, 1st - Führer Hitler has ordered the promotion of Lieutenant General Heinrici and Lieutenant General Salmuth to the rank of General, and Vice Admiral Marschall to the rank of Admiral.</p>
<p>Berlin, Transocean News Agency, 1st - Last night's official German announcement revealed that among the three generals awarded the rank of Colonel General, Colonel General Kleist is the most popular. Kleist has outstanding military achievements and is known as the "Tank General." Born in 1881, he was already retired when the current European war broke out. The authorities requested him to come out of retirement to command the 22nd Army Corps. He led tank troops to break through the southern flank of the Polish army. Subsequently, he led his army south, broke through the River Béthune to reach the coast of the Strait of English Channel, and occupied Calais and Boulogne. In the Balkan campaign, Kleist's tanks occupied Niš and Belgrade. Later, he fought a major battle with the Soviet army on the coast of the Sea of Azov. In November 1941, he captured Rostov, gaining widespread fame.</p>
<h3>The Powerful Tojo Cabinet: Promoting New Talent Regardless of Seniority; Advocating the Spirit of Selflessness and Devotion to Public Service; Translated from the January Issue of "Enterprise" (1)</h3>
<p>The Nature of the Tojo Cabinet</p>
<p>The political power of the four chief officers of the cabinet has never been as strong as in the Tojo Cabinet. Suzuki, president of the Planning Board, concurrently holds the position of Minister of State. Tani, president of the Information Bureau, in addition to his original position, also concurrently serves as Minister of Foreign Affairs. As such, two of the four chief officers in the current cabinet hold the position of Minister of State, which is unprecedented. In strengthening the authority of the Prime Minister, the Tojo Cabinet does not adopt the form of amending the Cabinet system, but instead focuses on strengthening the authority of the Prime Minister's political staff.</p>
<p>In October of Showa 16 (1941), following the resignation of the Third Konoe Cabinet, Lieutenant General Hideki Tojo received the imperial command to form a cabinet. When selecting cabinet members, he avoided recruiting well-known figures. At that time, the international situation was becoming increasingly urgent. Although political parties had temporarily dissolved, the former leaders of the political parties still held the potential to influence politics. Therefore, people generally believed that representatives from all levels would be recruited to form a leadership cabinet. However, Prime Minister Tojo defied this expectation and boldly promoted his former acquaintances who were in lower positions. It seems that Prime Minister Tojo had already made up his mind and had decided on the fundamental policy for the cabinet's operation from the time he formed the cabinet.</p>
<p>Whether a so-called leadership cabinet is appropriate for effectively exerting political power is worth discussing. The Konoe Cabinet attempted to recruit so-called big figures from the political and financial circles, such as Kazushige Ugaki, Nobumasa Suetsugu, and Shigeki Ikeda, and diligently worked towards the unity of the emergency cabinet. However, it did not achieve the expected results. To avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, Prime Minister Tojo not only did not recruit big figures, but also valued personal relationships. When selecting cabinet members, he tried his best to avoid unfamiliar people. He chose people whom he was confident that his influence could reach. The Tojo Cabinet's appointment of Foreign Minister Tani and Greater East Asia Minister Aoki still maintains this consistent principle. However, this has led to criticism of a "family cabinet." This is the first characteristic of the Tojo Cabinet. The aforementioned establishment of the four chief officers of the cabinet, with comrades as the core, is its second characteristic.</p>
<p>The political center of power of the Tojo Cabinet is naturally in the hands of these four chief officers of the cabinet. A powerful cabinet organization like the "Inner Cabinet" in the British wartime cabinet was studied shortly after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. In a sense, the meeting of the four chief officers has the function and power of an "Inner Cabinet."</p>
<p>Organizing a cabinet based on the union of comrades and placing its political center on the four chief officers is proving, as Prime Minister Tojo expected, to exert a powerful political force for the cabinet. The Tojo Cabinet advocated "consistency between words and deeds" as its highest principle. Reversing the previous cabinets' malpractice of only focusing on empty talk and neglecting practical matters, it has gained the support and trust of the people. The biggest reason for the success of the Tojo Cabinet's consistency between words and deeds lies in the aforementioned new method of cabinet operation.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Ministry of Greater East Asia to reorganize and integrate the administrative agencies and the generation of this political power are naturally due to this, which previous cabinets could not achieve. The original plan for the Ministry of Greater East Asia was kept secret by the four chief officers of the cabinet. When it was presented to the other cabinet members a few days before the cabinet meeting, some cabinet members held different opinions, but it was too late to do anything about it.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo's political operations, such as the simplification of administration and the reorganization of matters jointly managed by various ministries, are most effective against the impenetrable factionalism of the various ministries. Each minister has a firm conviction and powerful authority. The position of the Prime Minister can only be stabilized on the balance of power of the various ministers. In such a cabinet, it is extremely difficult to implement various reforms. Rather than that, it is easier to achieve results by appointing comrades with lower positions and placing its political center in the four chief officers of the cabinet, and promoting powerful politics on this basis. In this regard, Prime Minister Tojo has almost completely achieved the results he expected.</p>
<p>The Duties of the Four Chief Officers of the Cabinet</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the power of the four chief officers of the cabinet is exceptionally strong in the Tojo Cabinet. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to choose the right people for the positions of the four chief officers of the cabinet. Furthermore, the people who hold the positions of the four chief officers of the cabinet should be more selfless and devoted to their duties than anyone else. This is based on the demands of Prime Minister Tojo's nature. Prime Minister Tojo is straightforward and is a typical person full of conviction. He is strict with himself and is stern. With the conviction of selflessness, he resolutely implements the results of his own careful deliberation and has absolute certainty. After careful deliberation and judgment, he quickly handles affairs. This kind of political operation is in line with the wartime administration's requirement of putting judgment and implementation first. Therefore, Prime Minister Tojo himself has a stubborn and confident personality, but such a personality can easily be blinded by prejudice. Thus, the duties of the four chief officers of the cabinet who assist the cabinet become even more important.</p>
<p>During wartime, it goes without saying that all political changes must be absolutely avoided. Since the Sino-Japanese War, there have been many political changes in Japan's recent political history. The leaders of the countries who are struggling often take the lead in sacrificing themselves for the country. Japan is not as good as its allies Germany and Italy in this regard. The resignation of the cabinet is regarded as the completion of the cabinet's responsibility. This concept of political change is extremely dangerous during wartime. In Japan, the old concept of political change has been abandoned. Supporting the Tojo Cabinet to advance vigorously for the completion of the Greater East Asia War is the duty of the wartime government to the people. Prime Minister Tojo's dedication to the country is unprecedented by any cabinet leader since the Sino-Japanese War. Therefore, the Japanese people will definitely give him their complete trust.</p>
<p>However, the above does not mean that all actions of the cabinet's leadership are unconditionally justified. The duties of the four chief officers of the cabinet are all the more important in the sense that they assist Prime Minister Tojo, as mentioned earlier. Prime Minister Tojo is a soldier, and his straightforwardness is also reflected in his politics. The cabinet staff who assist him should calmly and widely gather opinions and advise on the best policies. A selfless spirit is even more necessary. This kind of cultivation of the cabinet staff is a pressing requirement for Prime Minister Tojo and the people to complete the wartime policies.</p>
<p>During wartime, the government's leadership must not be afraid of difficulties and avoid responsibility. Using the name of war as a talisman, rejecting loyal advice, and repelling criticism is an abuse of the term wartime. During wartime, the people cannot help but speak out. If this criticism is used as a shield under the name of war, it is the most heinous crime during wartime.</p>
<p>On the path to completing the Greater East Asia War, the strategy of expanding war power centered on expanding productivity has already departed from the old concept of capitalism's pursuit of profits and is moving towards the path of gathering the total power of the people. The road ahead is full of thorns. The final victory of the Greater East Asia War will also be quite arduous. Therefore, what we require of the cabinet staff—the cabinet staff who will not be changed before the victory is completed—is to have the spirit of self-sacrifice with flowing hot blood and a calm, scientifically constructed mind. As this new year begins, we wish the staff of the glorious wartime cabinet even greater vigor and also hope that they will make even greater efforts and work tirelessly.</p>
<p>The Tojo Cabinet's Policy Direction</p>
<p>The center of gravity of the Tojo Cabinet is, of course, Prime Minister Tojo. Lieutenant General Hideki Tojo, who has commanded on the front lines, is a man of conviction and emotion. His aggressive attitude during parliamentary debates is a revelation of his true feelings. The evasiveness and vagueness characteristic of politicians, which can be seen as refined on the one hand, and as political cunning on the other, have not been tainted by Prime Minister Tojo in the slightest.</p>
<p>The reason why Prime Minister Tojo is able to win people's hearts is fundamentally due to his selfless devotion to public service and responsible political operations. This is probably due to the Prime Minister's own pure character. Under the iron rule of consistency between words and deeds, he realizes the pure sentiments of a soldier in politics. When encountering difficult problems, he never procrastinates and goes straight ahead. He never uses political tactics like the politicians of the past, nor does he engage in false courtesies. For example, the school system reform plan, as everyone knows, once it is decided by the cabinet, it becomes the formal official system. Faithful to the belief of consistency between words and deeds, he does not fear difficulties and resolutely implements it. The previous cabinet adopted a policy of local resolution and non-expansion for the Sino-Japanese War, which dragged on to this point. There is a world of difference between that and the current cabinet's straightforward launch of the Greater East Asia War to investigate the root cause. The difference lies in the different ways of operating politics.</p>
<p>In other aspects, Prime Minister Tojo also has a character of enduring hardship, being meticulous in handling affairs. For example, when the Prime Minister was out on the street, someone asked him how he felt. He said, "People often ask me what I am most interested in, what kind of games I like, and what personal hobbies I have. This is definitely not something to talk about easily at this time." His answer was: "First, having taken on the important task of assisting, and His Majesty taking the heart of the people as His own, the Prime Minister's responsibility is, of course, to embody this sincerity. Second, the matters decided by the cabinet, that is, the government policies decided by the cabinet, how to permeate the lower organizations of the people, must be deeply understood in order to see their hidden aspects. Third, in order to share the hardships of the industrial warriors and the soldiers on the front lines, I am working desperately to arouse the greater efforts of the industrial warriors and to let the soldiers on the front lines know the tranquility of the rear." From the old to the young and the industrial warriors, everyone who heard these words deeply understood the Prime Minister's feelings. This is truly Prime Minister Tojo's profound political philosophy and is truly the best policy for creating psychology. Former Duke Konoe cannot be said to be a person who did not know the character of others, but the direct connection with the masses was very weak. Prime Minister Tojo was able to win people's hearts unexpectedly even when he was out on the street, and his answer, "This is definitely not something to talk about easily at this time," aroused infinite respect in us.</p>

By virtue of his strategic planning, Paulus has held down a large number of Soviet troops in Stalingrad for eight weeks, preventing them from launching a breakthrough and inflicting heavy damage on several Soviet armies. Therefore, the achievement of the Sixth Army is important and is not inferior to other armies that have previously engaged in blitzkrieg strategies. Colonel General Paulus took the lead in the resistance, vowing to live and die with his subordinates. His ambition is commendable. Therefore, Führer Hitler has specially promoted Paulus to the rank of Colonel General to commend the valor of Paulus himself and the entire Sixth Army.</p>

<h3>American Education System Under Contradictory and Confused Emotions; Rigid Military Training Forgets Spiritual Strength; Special Correspondent Hosokawa, Argentine Capital</h3>
<p>(Dispatch of the 23rd) The United States is currently aiming to become a highly militarized nation, reorganizing government agencies, restructuring economic institutions, and reforming various social organizations. Under the wave of this wartime situation, the education sector has also undergone significant changes. The main characteristics of this trend are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Militarization of School Facilities</p>
<p>This academic year, 250,000 military personnel from the U.S. Army and Navy have entered universities and specialized schools to receive specialized education. In addition, schools have also provided special combat education to another 250,000 students. The ordinary student corps in various schools have also abolished the original "Reserve Non-Commissioned Officer Corps" organization and have been incorporated into the "Army and Navy Trainee Officer Corps." Eight hundred thousand male and female students under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education are receiving six months of training in order to learn the specialized skills of general factories and military supply factories. At the same time, the U.S. Army and Navy have each established directly affiliated schools within universities and specialized schools. The student groups within these schools are independent, using self-compiled textbooks and establishing their own school rules. Students above the level of specialized schools study with them, which is cumbersome because they have not received military training.</p>
<p>For example, the University of North Carolina has provided ten of its twenty-two dormitories, as well as sports facilities, dining halls, infirmaries, and many other facilities, to the Navy for the training of 1,500 candidates at the preparatory flight school attached to the university. In addition, Indiana University opened a naval training center in July of last year, recruiting 600 soldiers. The same number of women recruited by the Navy are being educated. Thomas University has had 13 classrooms, the assembly hall of the athletic field, and five dormitories requisitioned by the Navy for visiting athletes to stay in when competing with other schools.</p>
<p>The above is regarding the Navy. As for the Army, it is also using the same method to make maximum use of the facilities within universities.</p>
<p>Reform of Universities and Specialized Schools</p>
<p>Students aged 18 and 19 who are currently studying in specialized schools and secondary schools cannot but leave school due to the provisions of the new conscription law. Therefore, at the meeting of the American University and Specialized School Alliance held in Philadelphia, in order to enable students who are over the conscription age of 18 to take advantage of specialized schools and universities, it was decided to establish a "Student Training Corps to be Called Up." The plan was that the principals unanimously believed that due to the provisions of the new plan, students could receive education not only while in school, fundamentally reducing the higher education system, to the point that it could be said that the higher education system has been eliminated.</p>
<p>Therefore, research in technical sciences, mathematics, and other departments in various specialized schools and universities must be taught only when deemed necessary by the Army and Navy authorities, completely changing the curriculum of each school in order to adapt to the total war wartime system.</p>
<p>This fundamental reform implemented in the field of higher education will be handed down permanently, making it the most fundamental and drastic change in American higher education in the past four and a half centuries. It can be said to be a comprehensive reform implemented to adapt to total war. The content of the reform, in addition to preparing special courses for students of conscription age and students in military supply industries, also pays special attention to physical fitness training under the supervision of military authorities.</p>
<p>The University of North Carolina has opened a "Wartime Training Section" to train students over the age of 16 for "frontline and rear" tasks. Also, last autumn, a "Preparation for Enlistment Section" was opened for senior students, planning to first train a portion of the national army in the wartime training section for conscripts aged 18 and 19.</p>
<p>Changes in Secondary School Subjects</p>
<p>Secondary schools throughout the United States are changing their curriculum to adapt to the necessities of wartime, abandoning traditional classical subjects and replacing them with practical subjects. The changes in the various subjects in the technical field are most noteworthy. Various schools are making aeronautics, electricity, radio construction, as well as labor, mathematics, physics, and chemistry, etc., the main courses, as they are related to aviation. The Cleveland City Board of Education recently passed a revision案 of the secondary school curriculum, and senior students in New York City's secondary schools are required to take flight preparation lectures, aeronautics, and enlistment preparation as required courses.</p>
<p>The curriculum of Chicago's secondary schools has also changed, with newly established flight preparation lectures and aeronautics becoming required courses from January of this year. Technical training is also the main focus of Boston's secondary schools, fundamentally changing the curriculum and establishing courses in applied mathematics, aeronautics, aerodynamics, meteorology, and navigation. Schools in Lausanne are also offering "Victory Lectures" as remedial courses.</p>
<p>Wartime Education for Female Students</p>
<p>American women are now also holding important positions in the government and military supply industries. Women's colleges and specialized schools in the United States are now also adapting to wartime needs and revising the content of their teaching. Many women with liberal arts degrees are now returning to school to receive several months of remedial education before taking on various special tasks. Therefore, women's colleges and specialized schools are also adding mathematics, physics, chemistry, and other subjects that are currently urgently needed, and are encouraging women to receive technical training.</p>
<p>Poverty of Spiritual Education</p>
<p>On the reverse side of the militarization of education in the United States, we have discovered the poverty of spiritual education. They overemphasize materialism, so they do not know the importance of spiritual education, and they also lack the ability to understand its importance. However, some people in the American education sector have noticed this and have expressed dissatisfaction. For example, Winifred Fisher, the executive director of the New York City Adult Education Association, lamented that only a few percent of the city's adult education attendees were at a recent [lecture] on American history.</p>
<p>Confusion and Contradictions in the Education Sector</p>
<p>The contradictions currently faced by the American education sector are extremely profound. First, the war is about to reach the stage of sacrificing schoolchildren, and Margaret Lewisohn, president of the New York City Education Association, is very worried about this point. As mentioned above, American schoolchildren have already been sacrificed for the war. The juvenile crime rate in New York City increased by 14 percent in the first half of 1942 compared to the same period in 1941. This is because the city's education budget was cut by nearly 4 million yuan, preventing the social isolation facilities from functioning and contributing to the rise in the juvenile crime rate. Therefore, the short-sighted policies of the authorities are quite unreasonable.</p>
<p>Second, as a result of the decrease in the number of students after the implementation of the new conscription law, the finances of various universities are in a very difficult situation. Marquette University President [Father] McCarthy said:</p>
<p>"Many universities will not be able to operate without government subsidies."</p>
<p>Third, the biggest reason for the chaos in American school education during wartime is that the government does not have a unified education policy. Originally, various government departments had a great influence on universities and specialized schools. The unplanned implementation of various policies is bound to lead to mutual contradictions. For example, professors of economics and statistics are mostly poached by the Wartime Production Planning Board, the Price Control Board, and other government offices. Many are also summoned to Washington for urgent matters. Therefore, the educational capacity of universities is inevitably significantly reduced or destroyed: as a result, the military or civilians cannot obtain young people with sufficient academic ability.

<h3>East Asia League Second Anniversary Celebration; Chairman Wang Attends to Give Instructions</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 1st [of the month] (Central News Agency) - Yesterday (the 1st) was the second anniversary of the founding of the China General Association of the East Asia League. The General Association and the Nanjing Branch held an enlarged celebration ceremony at the National Assembly Hall at 4:00 PM. Attendees included Chairman and Directors Chu Minyi, Wen Zongyao, Lin Baisheng, Chen Qun, Jun Qiang, Zhou Xuechang, Cai Pei, Zhou Huarren, Xu Suzhong, and others, as well as over a thousand representatives from various local branches. The meeting began with the entire assembly bowing three times to the national flag and party flag, and bowing once to the chairman in tribute. Chairman Wang was then respectfully invited to give instructions, followed by the entire assembly shouting slogans and the ceremony was declared complete amidst the resounding music.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 1st [of the month] (Central News Agency) - In his address at the second anniversary celebration of the East Asia League, the chairman first pointed out that holding the second anniversary celebration of the China General Association of the East Asia League after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and China's participation in the Greater East Asia War has great significance. The work of the past two years has focused on the ideological movement. From today onwards, the East Asia League movement should move from the ideological movement to concrete action. He then explained in three points: First, in principle, he pointed out that the foundation of the East Asia League lies in the Eastern moral spirit. The biggest difference between the Eastern moral spirit and Western utilitarianism is that one is a co-prosperity sphere ideology and the other is colonialism; one aims for coexistence and the other aims for exploitation. Both need material resources, but with regard to human resources, one treats people as people, respecting their conscience and personality, while the other does not treat people as people, viewing them as cattle, horses, machines, or materials, stifling their conscience, disregarding their personality, extracting their blood and sweat, and discarding their shells. The collapse of British imperialism is due to this. The East Asia League is based on the Eastern moral spirit, reversing the utilitarianism and colonialism of the past, so it will be able to stimulate the pure patriotism and East Asian awareness of the East Asian nations, enabling the people of each East Asian country to love their own country, love their neighbors, and love East Asia together. Second, in terms of basic conditions, he analyzed that the four major綱領s of the East Asia League movement, namely political independence, economic cooperation, military alliance, and cultural communication, are the concrete embodiment of the Eastern moral spirit. The forms and institutions of the League are yet to be discussed, so they will not be discussed in detail here. However, these four major纲领s will surely clear away the poisonous influence of Western utilitarianism, unite the human and material resources of Greater East Asia to establish a new East Asia of coexistence and co-prosperity, unite internally, and resist external aggression. This can be asserted. Third, in terms of concrete action, he pointed out that the emergence of the East Asia League recognizes that the revival of China and the construction of East Asia are inseparable, that is, the two major missions of reviving China and defending East Asia are inseparable. China's participation in the war is to share the obligation of defending East Asia. The return of concessions by friendly nations and the abolition of extraterritorial rights are to assist the progress of reviving China. The two are by no means conditions for exchange, but are completely based on the Eastern moral spirit as a starting point. According to the development of the situation, the four major纲领s of the East Asia League are being gradually advanced. We must make redoubled efforts in the political, military, economic, and cultural aspects under the grand goal of completing the Greater East Asia War. As for the point of cultural communication, some people mistakenly believe that it is revivalism, which is a great fallacy. In order to complete the war and build East Asia, we must lead in promoting the inherent moral spirit of the East, and we must also strive for the progress of science and technology. The scope of culture is very broad, but in terms of current needs, those used in science and technology should account for ninety-five or six percent, and those used in other aspects should only account for four or five percent. In short, since we are now entering the stage of concrete action of the East Asia League, we should take the East Asia League as our goal, arouse the spirit of the New National Movement, and advance bravely. On the one hand, we can start from the assurance of political independence, and then economic cooperation, military alliance, and cultural communication can be put into practice. On the other hand, we must make our greatest efforts in the three aspects of economic cooperation, military alliance, and cultural communication to provide the greatest guarantee for political independence. The completion of the Greater East Asia War and the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere lie in this. The revival of China and the defense of East Asia also depend on this.</p>
<h3>Minister of Construction Chen Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 1st [of the month] (Central News Agency) - Minister of Construction Chen has taken office and delivered the following inaugural address: "In order to establish a wartime system and give full play to efficiency, the National Government has resolutely reformed the administrative structure to concentrate power and simplify the organization. Such measures are indeed necessary in wartime. As for merging the Water Conservancy Commission into the Ministry of Transportation and reorganizing it into the Ministry of Construction to manage transportation, water conservancy, and urban construction, it is also one of the government's single化 policy. Transportation is the foundation of construction, water conservancy is essential for increasing production, and cities are transportation centers and economic hubs, which are closely related to the former two. Therefore, urban construction is also not to be delayed. To seek balanced development, a unified coordinating agency is established. Today, our country is dedicated to the Greater East Asia Liberation War, and has progressed from the spirit of sharing joys and sorrows to the action of sharing life and death. The development of various construction projects in the rear is not only related to ensuring the wartime life of the people, but also an element in strengthening the overall strength of the military economy and other aspects. In order to establish the foundation for national revival, enrich national strength, and cooperate with friendly nations to ensure victory, all our compatriots should promote奮勵 and assist the country in completing this era's mission as soon as possible. Regarding the work aspect, I have been in charge of the water conservancy industry for over four months, and all the projects that should be urgently handled this year have been planned and are being actively prepared and started. Now, having been ordered to take charge of construction, in addition to actively promoting the water conservancy project in accordance with the established plan, we should strive to improve the management of transportation undertakings such as railways, highways, shipping administration, telecommunications, and postal services, and further plan to expand them. As for urban construction, the central government and local governments must plan carefully before implementing it in stages. All of these are current priorities, which require considerable expense and time. The difficulties ahead are deeply daunting. However, I can only do my best under the guidance of the highest leader to repay the great trust. I hope that all parties will provide assistance and that the people of the whole country will work together to complete the great cause of national construction. I am extremely fortunate."</p>

<h3>Vichy Government Resolves to Organize Militia - Volunteer System to Maintain Domestic Security - Darnand Appointed Secretary-General</h3>
<p>Vichy, 1st (Central News Agency) - The French government held a cabinet meeting in the afternoon of the 31st, presided over by Chief Laval. A decision was reached regarding the organization of the French militia. The organization will be based on the current veterans' groups, and 30,000 laborers will be recruited on a voluntary basis. In addition, it was decided to reform the organization of the existing French Gendarmerie. The organizational law for the newly formed French militia has been published in the official gazette, with the following main points: The French militia will be organized from selected members of the French people to engage in the reconstruction of France's political, social, economic, and spiritual life. The recruitment of the militia will be voluntary, but subject to strict scrutiny, and only those deemed qualified will be accepted. The militia must have the desire to protect the people and maintain order in France. Furthermore, as the militia is a political organization, it will also engage in propaganda and all aspects of economic, social, and cultural endeavors. Chief Laval has appointed Darnand, the current security director of the French Veterans Association, as the first commander of the militia.</p>

<h3>Economic Trends in Central China - Recruiting Talent to Strengthen the Economic Commission - Sino-Japanese Cooperation to Enhance Combat Power</h3>
<p>February 1st, Continental New Paper</p>
<p>Now we have reached the second year of the decisive battle against Britain and the United States. The National Government should participate in the war, and the New China is also beginning to move forward at this time. Japan, in order to practice equality and mutual benefit, has decided to abolish extraterritorial rights in China, return concessions, and declare its policy towards China both internally and externally. It is expected that the economic policies of Central China will also follow this goal. The direction of Central China's economic progress this year became clear in January. Now, let's briefly list a few of the important economic matters:</p>
<p>Participation of the National Government</p>
<p>The National Government's participation in the war on January 9th created the biggest turning point in the economy of Central China since the start of the Greater East Asia War. This new path is the National Government's voluntary participation in the war, deciding for itself the direction that China should take. The Japanese side supports the National Government's participation in the war and changes its policy in China. With these two relationships, a new path is created.</p>
<p>The former means strengthening the National Government and implementing an autonomous economic policy. The goal is very clear. At the Supreme National Defense Conference on January 13th, the National Government passed a comprehensive reform of institutions. At the second Supreme National Defense Conference on January 20th, a new structure for the National Economic Commission was decided. The list of the new Economic Commission added seven people from the Northern China economic giants Zhou Zuomin, Tang Shoumin, and Wu Zhenxi. At the third meeting on the 28th, Qian Daqun, Li Quanshi, and eight others were added.</p>
<p>This time, the National Economic Commission invited private economists to participate, which is to closely combine the National Government, which has always been less accessible, with the economic community, and to consult the views of the economic community to serve as a reference for the National Government's economic administration. Preparing to harmonize economic controls with implementation, as a result, the representatives of the economic community all stood on the government's position. In other words, they stood on the side of control. In the future, following the plans of the commission, a new economic system will be established and smoothly promoted.</p>
<p>The latter is to consider and discuss the new China policy, with the Japanese determination to cope with the decisive war period as the first premise. The United States is trying its best to reverse the decline this year, so Japan has to put all its efforts into suppressing it. Because of this relationship, it is necessary to quickly strengthen the political power of the National Government to avoid future worries and adapt to the current needs to implement the transformation of Central China's economy.</p>
<p>What are the specific strategies for policy transformation? Although it has not been explicitly told to us, due to the various needs of the times mentioned above, its direction is of course: "Chinese affairs are handled by the Chinese." Because the National Government participated in the war, the past economic separation between China and Japan in China has been completely removed. This is a noteworthy point.</p>
<p>Food Countermeasures</p>
<p>The Japanese Army and Navy authorities stationed in Shanghai and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government issued a notice on the 11th of last month, restricting the movement of important food supplies. From January 13th, all important food supplies are prohibited from being moved into the Shanghai concession area or exported from the "cleansing" areas without proper procedures. The authorities have taken this measure to eliminate the collusion between the Shanghai food black market and the inland areas, stabilize rice prices in the production areas, and promote purchases to cope with this serious food problem. Since the publication of this notice, the price of rice has gradually returned to normal, not only in the Shanghai surroundings, but also in the "cleansing" areas. Because the Lunar New Year is approaching, farmers need cash, and now they can buy in large quantities, which is a good opportunity.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of January this year, the National Government's Ministry of Food has received strong assistance from the Japanese military authorities and has begun to purchase food, and the work is progressing very smoothly.</p>
<p>Controlling Prices</p>
<p>The strengthening of economic controls has become an extremely important issue due to Japan's decisive battle and the National Government's participation in the war. In this situation, the Public Works Department took two measures, first issuing a notice on January 23rd. Strengthening control measures, stipulating that the prices of all manufactured goods and wholesale goods must not exceed the level of January 23rd. From then on, the control of retail prices was also more severe than in the past. On January 27th, a notice was issued to restrict the transfer of cloth. The purpose of this measure is to prevent speculative transactions of cloth that take advantage of the opportunity to transfer cloth without the permission of the Shanghai Embassy Office. After the Public Works Department implemented this measure, then apart from the absolutely necessary transfer, there is no way to transfer, so the price limit of cloth is easy to maintain.

<h3>Authorities Concerned About People's Food Supply - Decide to Increase Ration Quantities - Purchasing Situation Improved After Embargo - Bangkok Rice Supplies Needs of This City - Monthly Ration Per Person to be Increased by 1.2 Kilograms Again</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai - The relevant authorities are actively working to increase the quantity of rationed rice in Shanghai and to regulate the supply and demand of food. With the end of the Lunar New Year approaching, the authorities have decided that the quantity of rationed rice for Chinese people in the Shanghai area will be increased by another 1.2 kilograms (1.5 shi sheng) per person per month in the near future. At present, the quantity of rationed rice for Chinese people is 4.8 kilograms per person per month. After this increase of 1.2 kilograms, it will total 6 kilograms. As for the rationed flour, which is 2.5 kilograms per person per month, it will remain unchanged. Therefore, it is expected that the shortage of food will be greatly alleviated in the future. This increase in the quantity of rice is due to the fact that the purchasing situation in the rural areas of the mainland has improved after the implementation of the ban on the private transportation of rice to the Shanghai area on January 13. The amount of purchases has greatly increased. At the same time, the import of foreign rice is very smooth. However, the collection of fees in the mainland is still progressing gradually. After this, the anxiety of some of the people about the food shortage can be gradually eliminated, and it is expected that the black market transaction of rice will also disappear completely.</p>
<p>Strictly Inspecting Suspicious Pedestrians</p>
<p>A reporter learned from relevant sources that the authorities have been tightening their search efforts in recent days in order to thoroughly stabilize the rice market. Anyone carrying heavy packages, boxes, or suspicious pedestrians must undergo extremely strict inspections in order to prevent various food supplies from being stolen and transported for profit by petty thieves, and to reassure the people.</p>
<p>Purchasing as Much Rice as Possible from Various Regions</p>
<p>In order to maintain the food supply for Shanghai residents and fully ration household food, the authorities will purchase foreign rice from Bangkok, Vietnam, and divide the domestic rice-producing areas into five regions for unified purchasing. At the same time, the flour produced by flour mills in Central China will be supplied to the authorities as much as possible to meet the needs of the people. The rationing of household food in Shanghai will be planned and distributed by the authorities as a whole, according to the actual needs, and designated rice shops will be responsible for selling household food.</p>
<p>Purchasing Agencies Divided into Five Regions</p>
<p>The purchasing work in Central China was previously carried out separately by Showa Trading and the Gunbai Cooperative. The portion purchased by Showa Trading is purely for "special needs," while the portion purchased by the Gunbai Cooperative is supplied for general civilian use and for export to Japan. The Gunbai purchasing work was previously carried out by each business firm participating in the cooperative. Now, it has been changed to be handled by the local purchasing agency. There are five local purchasing agencies: (1) the Bengbu Purchasing Association, centered on the Jinpu Railway line and the Huai River basin; (2) the Anqing Regional Purchasing Association, centered on the Anqing section of the Yangtze River; (3) the Nanjing Regional Purchasing Association, centered on the Grand Canal; (4) the Suzhou Regional Purchasing Association, centered on the "cleansing" areas; (5) the Wuhu Regional Purchasing Association, centered on Huainan. The regional purchasing associations will make full use of existing organizations, such as the Japan-China Miscellaneous Grain Cooperative Committee in Bengbu and the Anqing Grain and Fertilizer Association in Anqing, and will not form new purchasing agencies. As for the purchasing associations in Nanjing, Wuhu, and other regions, there are no similar organizations that can be utilized, so they will be re-established.</p>
<p>Trying Every Possible Way to Regulate the People's Food Supply</p>
<p>A reporter learned from relevant sources yesterday that the Japanese Cabinet has decided to allocate huge sums of money to subsidize the Central China Agricultural Assistance Association for the purpose of increasing agricultural production. With the government leading the way and the local authorities cooperating behind the scenes, there is hope for improvement in the food problem. (1) The Japanese side has allowed the Food Management Committee to handle the rice purchasing matters. (2) The Food Committee has now decided to reorganize into the Ministry of Food, and has decided to implement state management for rice purchasing. The purchasing work will be the responsibility of the specially established Rice and Grain Purchase and Sales General Management Office. (3) Food warehouse bonds of 500 million yuan will be issued for the purpose of purchasing and storing food. (4) The purchasing price will be readjusted to avoid the abuse of squeezing farmers. (5) A batch of foreign rice has recently been shipped in. According to the third economic agreement between Japan and Vietnam, Thai and Vietnamese white rice will continue to be shipped to Central China in the future. Therefore, the food problem in Central China has now shown signs of being resolved. This is a gratifying thing.</p>

<h3>Mayor Chen's Broadcast Speech</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai) The Shanghai Branch of the China General Association of the East Asia League, in celebration of the second anniversary of the founding of the Nanjing General Association, has invited officials from various agencies in the city to give broadcast speeches starting yesterday (1st). Yesterday from 2:00 PM to 2:30 PM, Mayor Chen Gongbo was invited to give a speech on the second anniversary of the China General Association of the East Asia League and its significance on Shanghai Radio. The original words of the broadcast are recorded below:</p>
<p>Fellow citizens, today is the second anniversary of the founding of the China General Association of the East Asia League. It is also the occasion of China's participation in the war, and its significance is far-reaching.</p>
<p>It can be said that Dr. Sun Yat-sen was the originator of the idea of the East Asia League. His advocacy of Pan-Asianism in 1924 was a concrete expression of the East Asia League idea. Dr. Sun reviewed the current situation in Asia, traced its past glory, and knew that the various ethnic groups in East Asia, especially the Chinese and Japanese, had a close relationship of sharing life and death, and sharing joys and sorrows. Therefore, the East Asia League can be said to be a sacred product of history, and it is bound to happen.</p>
<p>In East Asia's geography and history, there is no China without Japan, and there is no Japan without China. Dr. Sun Yat-sen has already told us this, because if there had not been Japan's restoration and become a strong country in East Asia, China would have long been divided by the white British and American imperialists. The reason why Britain and the United States did not dare to rashly divide China was because Japan, which led East Asia, was there. But on the other hand, if China had been divided by Britain and the United States earlier, then the situation in East Asia would have long changed. East Asia would have been entirely in the hands of Britain and the United States, and Japan's restoration would have easily encountered difficulties. Britain and the United States would have put entire pressure on Japan. Therefore, from a historical perspective, the alliance of East Asian nations, the close cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese nations, has long been determined in politics, military affairs, economy, and culture. China hopes that Japan, with the position of leader of the East Asian nations, will assist China to make China strong and to take on the responsibility of the East Asian region. If China is weak, Japan's responsibility will be increased. If China is strong, it can shoulder a portion of the responsibility for the liberation of East Asia and can assist Japan to achieve the liberation of East Asia as soon as possible. Japanese intellectuals also feel this great vision, so they cooperate and support the East Asia League. From a historical perspective, during the Russo-Japanese War, China's power was very weak and could not resist the invasion of Manchuria by Tsarist Russia. Japan, feeling that it was its inescapable duty to defend East Asia, did not hesitate to sacrifice itself to declare war on Tsarist Russia. If China had had the power at that time, it would not have been necessary for Japan to sacrifice itself so much, and it could have driven Tsarist Russia's forces out on its own. This proves that China's weakness is harmful to Japan. Similarly, in today's Greater East Asia War, if the peoples of India, the Philippines, Burma, Malaya, and other countries had their own power, the Greater East Asia War would have been successful and victorious long ago. Therefore, the East Asia League hopes that all East Asian nations will be strong and equal, and that each will stand on its own position and strive to share the task of liberating East Asia.</p>
<p>I just said that Dr. Sun Yat-sen can be said to be the first person to advocate the idea of the East Asia League, but decades of environmental changes and the instigation of Britain and the United States have prevented this idea from being realized. Now, the idea of the East Asia League is gradually flourishing, and it can be divided into three periods:</p>
<p>1. The first period: since the July 7th Incident, the idea of the East Asia League has been a period of enlightenment. Chinese and Japanese intellectuals have strived to promote the East Asia League in order to clear up past misunderstandings and to implement cooperation, equality, and mutual support.</p>
<p>2. The second period: since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th, it has been a period of promotion of the idea of the East Asia League. Japan has used force to eliminate the evil forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia, so that the East Asian nations can return to East Asia.</p>
<p>3. The third period: since the National Government's participation in the war on January 9th, it has been a period of realization of the East Asia League. China has already taken out its strength to participate in the war and realize the East Asia League. After this, the East Asian nations will naturally all take out their strength to realize the East Asia League. Time is very short, and the speech is very simple. On the occasion of celebrating the second anniversary of the China General Association of the East Asia League, I would like to wish the East Asia League to be realized as soon as possible and the East Asian nations to be liberated as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Hoping That All Sectors Send Fewer Letters</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration has been actively trying to clear and deliver mail from various places. However, due to the fact that land and water transportation in various places has not yet returned to its original state, it is difficult to deliver any kind of mail. The relevant authorities hope that all sectors will reduce the sending of unnecessary letters, which can not only save paper consumption, but also prevent the post office from accumulating large amounts of mail.</p>
<h3>The Two Settlements Requisition Hemp Bags; Overdue Confiscation and Punishment; Final Deadline is February 13th</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the French Municipal Council issued notices in mid-last month regarding the requisition of inland grain shipments to Shanghai. They stipulated that from January 18th, empty hemp bags would be purchased at a fixed price and must be delivered to the requisition offices of the two settlements by a deadline. It is now learned that the authorities of the two settlements, considering the urgency of the deadline for requisitioning hemp bags, have requested hemp bag owners to cooperate and promptly deliver the bags for purchase at the set price. Furthermore, the deadline has been extended to February 13th of this year. If the empty hemp bags are not delivered to the requisition offices by this deadline, the goods of the owners will be confiscated, and the hemp bag owners will be punished.</p>
<h3>Continuing Mr. Bao Fu's Ideas</h3>
<p>At this time of hardship, with devastation everywhere, the poor and sick are in a state of worry and suffering. Even the wealthy feel uncertain about the times and lack a sense of security. After reading Mr. Nie Yuntai's article "Methods for Preserving Wealth" published in the Shanghai Shen Bao, I was deeply moved. Disregarding my own limited knowledge, I wish to expand on his ideas and humbly seek correction from wise individuals within the country! Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>The ancients said, "The wealthy are unbenevolent," and also, "The virtuous are wealthy." These two sayings have opposite meanings, but in reality, everyone acknowledges that both are true. The wealth of the rich invariably comes from the flourishing of their businesses, accumulated from the labor and interest of everyone. If they enjoy their wealth alone, living in luxury and refusing to give, they will be envied by society. As the saying goes, "One family's warmth and fullness cause the resentment of a thousand families." They are thus seen as unbenevolent. Conversely, when a wealthy person sees the suffering of others, their fellow humans, and is moved to compassion and offers assistance, or when, guided by their conscience, they take out some money from their own pocket, no matter how much, to do good deeds, they are universally called "virtuous." Both are wealthy, but due to their different approaches to life, one is condemned as unbenevolent, while the other is praised as virtuous. There are also many wealthy individuals who sincerely do good for their own sake, regardless of the laughter and criticism of others, doing good deeds on their own.</p>
<p>Looking at Western history, there have been several wars fought to win freedom. And looking at the Republic of China after its establishment, there have been several civil wars fought by warlords and politicians to gain wealth. The pursuit of wealth seems to be the greatest aim of the masses. When meeting during the Lunar New Year, people first say, "Congratulations on getting rich." When entering the home of a scholar-official, you will see auspicious pictures of fortune, prosperity, longevity, and happiness hanging in the hall to express good fortune. "Fortune" refers to the hope of becoming a high official and getting rich. "Prosperity" refers to having a salary and not worrying about hunger and cold. "Longevity" refers to enjoying a long and healthy life. "Happiness" refers to having many children and grandchildren, bringing glory to ancestors and benefiting descendants. All of these represent the ideal picture of preserving wealth. However, how many families can realize this ideal? Even if they achieve this ideal state, becoming a high official and enjoying great fame, it is not necessarily a blessing! We often see that in fortunate families, the greater the fortune, the more anger there is. The head of the family is the receiver of anger. Zhang Gong's nine generations lived together, known as the "Hall of a Hundred Tolerances." The character "tolerance" (忍) is composed of "knife" (刀) and "heart" (心), signifying hidden pain that is not spoken. Enduring anger on the surface is a type of suffering. Gaining prosperity (祿) is also not easy. As the saying goes, "Receiving prosperity without merit is uneasy to eat and sleep." If you cannot fulfill your duty, you cannot receive your due prosperity! Receiving the prosperity of others means taking responsibility for them. Exchanging labor or sweat for money is not considered prosperity. The length of one's life cannot be calculated based on age. If a person cannot establish virtue, merit, or words, even a long life is premature. Wasting time is like being a stubborn stone, not keeping up with the times, and being falsely labeled as a "longevity head." Having too many children and grandchildren, traditionally considered having descendants, is truly a heavy burden of sin in the current difficult life. If they are not properly educated and cannot benefit society, their sins will extend not only to their ancestors but also to the parents. Many virtuous parents and glorious families are ruined by their children and grandchildren. The desire to preserve wealth is unfulfilled, which is truly lamentable.</p>
<p>I once tested the minds of elementary school students, asking them about the purpose of their studies. They all said, "To earn money in the future." Money is wealth, and although it is a good thing and can be used to enjoy life, it is not necessarily the right thing. I have asked many friends why they send their children to school, and they also say it is to allow them to earn money and become wealthy in the future, which makes me doubtful. I remember when I was young and receiving education, my teacher told me: "In books, there are houses of gold; in books, there are thousands of bushels of grain." This kind of teaching is not in line with the times. Nowadays, scholars cannot even afford food and clothing, so where are the houses of gold? Officials are public servants, and they are still worried about making ends meet, so how can they have thousands of bushels of grain? Reading Mr. Nie's article, he recounts the facts of prominent families educating their children, and quotes the teachings of Chinese sages, such as "Good fortune for the virtuous and misfortune for the wicked," and "Heaven's way diminishes excess and benefits humility..." The Qian hexagram says, "Able to benefit the world without prioritizing one's own benefit." Family needs say, "Filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame" - these eight virtues emphasize a sense of duty and deemphasize the desire for rights. These are truly medicinal words and pearl-like sentences. I want to advise families to use these ideas to teach their children, not focusing solely on earning money and becoming wealthy, and they will naturally be able to preserve their wealth in the future. I also want to advise educators and teachers to teach elementary school students, with their innocent hearts, how to establish character and live their lives in the future, as this is the long-term plan for enriching the country and the family!</p>
<p>Mencius said to King Hui of Liang: "The King says, 'What can benefit my state?' The ministers say, 'What can benefit my family?' The common people say, 'What can benefit myself?' When superiors and inferiors contend for profit, the state is endangered." "Qin Shi Huang conquered the six states, becoming wealthy throughout the world. He wanted to create a business for ten thousand generations, building the Great Wall and seeking the elixir of immortality. However, Shi Huang died in Shaqiu at the age of fifty, and the dynasty lasted only two generations before perishing. This wealth of the state is unreliable. A Dream of Red Mansions narrates the rise and fall of a large family and their joys and sorrows. This wealth of the family is unreliable. Jesus said in the Bible: "It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven." Buddha had great wisdom and intelligence, with twenty "no" characters in the Heart Sutra, indicating to people that everything is empty. "No color, sound, smell, taste, touch, or dharma" means cutting off the desire for wealth, and then one can have a mind without hindrance, without terror, and free from reversed dreams... able to remove all suffering. And Lao Tzu's philosophy actually says that nothing is greater than having a body, and even regards wealth as insignificant. In this way, wealth is not happiness.</p>
<p>Happiness is an internal thing, not an external one. It is self-aware rather than aroused by an object. Happiness is built entirely in one's own mind. Only in a life of contentment in poverty can one have the feelings of kites soaring and fish leaping. Even in a stormy environment, one can have the attitude of a benevolent person who is not worried. Even in the poverty of simple food and drink, one can still have Yan Hui's unchanging joy. Ibsen said it well: "Wealth can buy the shell of everything, but not its core. It can give you food, but not appetite; it can give you medicine, but not health; it can give you friends, but not loyalty; it can give you joy all day long, but not peace and interest." The nature of wealth is only like this. Now, times have changed, materials are scarce, and currency values fluctuate. Even if there are gold, silver, houses, and land, whether they are wealth still needs to be re-evaluated!</p>
<p>Several clever friends said, "To truly love your children, you should first teach them how to spend money, not teach them how to earn money. If they don't know how to spend it, earning it will be in vain. It is wise love to spend money on beneficial paths, generously helping others, and not being a miserly miser, lest they be envied and stolen from and suffer losses. Conversely, if they only focus on earning and not spending, they will inevitably resort to cunning and plunder. Money is fluid, and they will inevitably indulge in extravagance, harming their body and ruining their virtue. Loving them in this way is actually harming them." Therefore, the ancients said that accumulating wealth for descendants is not as good as accumulating virtue for descendants. In this time of uncertain world changes, wealth and status are like floating clouds. Doing good deeds and providing relief is also an investment. Rather than planning for temporary enjoyment for descendants, it is better to jointly plan for preserving the country and the family for a hundred years! Being able to earn money and being able to give is not unbenevolent. The wealthy should broaden their horizons and be willing to think of their poor and sick compatriots, helping each other through these difficult times. This is not only in line with the saying that "a virtuous person is wealthy," but also a shortcut to seeking happiness.</p>
<p>(Note) Written hastily, I am deeply ashamed of my limited knowledge. When I have more free time in the future, I plan to write "Scientific Methods for Preserving Wealth" to compare with Mr. Nie's ideas. It is not mysterious. I hope that economists, insurance experts, psychologists, and biologists will all share their insights.

<h3>Various Trade Associations Strictly Assess the Standard Price Limits for Goods; Punishment According to Regulations for Any Exceeding Limits; Absolute Ban on Trading with Non-Industry Members</h3>
<p>The various trade associations of this port, in order to uphold the intentions of the authorities, thoroughly stabilize the commercial market, and suppress the prices of various goods on a large scale, have successively established "Commodity Evaluation Committees" of each industry according to law to be responsible for evaluation matters. Progress has been particularly smooth. According to reporters, the matters under the management of the evaluation committees of various industries are divided into the following points: (1) Setting standard price limits; (2) Dispatching personnel to investigate the sales of goods by members of the same industry; (3) Conveying the opinions of the industry regarding the evaluation of commodity prices; (4) Finding ways to dredge the sources of goods from various places; (5) Adjusting the supply of goods; (6) Managing market transactions among industry members, etc. However, in order to achieve results, each industry is quite strict in its procedures. When ordered to evaluate the standard price limit of a certain commodity, it first sends a letter to the members of the respective industry associations, requiring them to submit the cost, source, amount of inventory, and transaction price among industry members of the commodity to the association by a specified date. Then, it convenes a meeting to strictly review the information. After the price limit is evaluated, it is submitted to the relevant authorities for review. After approval, evaluation forms are printed and distributed to members for compliance. If there are any violations, once discovered, they will be severely investigated. However, in order to achieve the effect of punishing one as a warning to a hundred, each industry has established penalty measures. Anyone who violates the price limit will be punished according to the relevant regulations, including expulsion from the association or denial of all rights. In addition, in order to clarify spot transactions and eliminate malpractices, each industry limits all spot and future goods transactions in the market to industry members only, strictly prohibiting resale to non-industry members, with the aim of preventing illegal hoarding and reducing the number of spot supply chips in the market.</p>

<h3>Truth About Yarn Industry Association Meeting: Only Reporting Government Laws and Regulations, No Exchange Matters</h3>
<p>Regarding the news published on the 30th of last month that the yarn and cloth exchange would resume trading next month, stating that the industry association had obtained approval from the authorities to resume trading from the fifth day of the Lunar New Year (i.e., February 9th in the Gregorian calendar), but should comply with the limit price for spot transactions, and that the industry association had convened a meeting of directors and supervisors on the 27th of last month to decide and notify the industry members to comply, the Shanghai Special Municipal Yarn Industry Association stated in a letter, "This association is an industry association formed by collecting industry members. The members usually gather at the association to discuss spot business only. Therefore, this association is not a yarn and cloth exchange and has no exchange business. As for the convening of all members on the 27th, it was to report on association affairs and government laws and regulations. The outside world does not understand the truth and often mistakes this association for a yarn and cloth exchange, which is obviously a false rumor. The organization and affairs of this association should be corrected to avoid misunderstanding."</p>
<h3>Total Number of Inmates in the Shanghai Municipal Council Prison Last Year Greatly Reduced Compared to Previous Years: Part 6 of the Shanghai Municipal Council Annual Report</h3>
<p>Last year, the total number of inmates detained in the Shanghai Municipal Council Prison, excluding the Juvenile Reformatory and foreign inmates, was greatly reduced compared to the previous year. At the beginning of last year, the three sections of inmates totaled 7,139, and at the end of the year, there were 5,441. The highest record was 7,139 on February 10th, and the lowest was 5,081 on December 27th.</p>
<p>Two Meals a Day</p>
<p>Last year, the Shanghai Municipal Council established a committee to study the reduction of prison expenses and investigate work conditions. As a result of the committee's recommendations, the boiler room and kitchen equipment were re-examined to save coal consumption, and a two-meal-a-day system was implemented in the prison. In addition, the ration of rice for inmates who did not work or were ill was reduced by one tael per day. This method was implemented for three months from September 14th to December 13th. According to the medical officer's report, the results were deemed inappropriate, as most of the inmates whose rice ration was reduced lost weight. The medical officer's report was then submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Council for review.</p>
<p>Difficult Food Supply</p>
<p>Due to the difficulty of food supply, the supply of corn and sorghum was suspended. In the second half of last year, it was also difficult to obtain soybeans and wheat. Therefore, the two items of soybeans and wheat were temporarily replaced with rice and soybeans.</p>
<p>Last year, there were 1,576 inmates imprisoned for theft. As of the end of the year, there were a total of 2,235 such inmates.</p>
<p>The number of Chinese inmates totaled 6,954 on January 1st of last year, and 5,236 on December 31st. The highest record was 7,361 on February 10th, and the lowest was 5,081 on December 27th. The daily average was 6,346.</p>
<p>Amnesty and Commutation</p>
<p>Last year, a total of eight inmates were released in accordance with the Amnesty Act promulgated on June 24, 1932. The new regulations on amnesty and commutation promulgated on July 2, 1940, stipulated that inmates who committed crimes before March 30, 1940, could be granted amnesty or commutation, except for those with serious cases. A total of 1,111 inmates were released in accordance with this new regulation.</p>
<p>A total of forty-nine inmates were released in accordance with the parole regulations. The validity period of the inmate medical parole regulations expired at the end of the year before last. The relevant authorities did not announce an extension. Five inmates who had been granted parole in accordance with this regulation the year before last were released last year.</p>
<p>Juvenile Reformatory</p>
<p>There were eighty-three juvenile inmates in the reformatory at the beginning of the year, which decreased to forty-five at the end of the year. A total of ninety-one juvenile inmates were sent to the reformatory throughout the year, and 126 were released. The juvenile inmates' behavior in the reformatory was generally good, and the sanitary conditions were generally good. Last year, a teacher was hired to take charge of the juvenile inmates' education, and another teacher was hired in January 1943.</p>
<p>An official from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Children's Protection Section visits the reformatory once a week and provides assistance to juvenile inmates after their release.</p>
<h3>Fresh Milk Consumers in This City Should Register with the Shanghai Municipal Council</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has recently issued Announcement No. 6255, which states that in order to ensure the fresh milk needs of children under the age of ten and patients, residents of the Public Settlement who obtain or intend to obtain a normal supply from the milk company at the official price should register the quantity needed at any of the council's certificate issuing offices on February 3rd and 4th, and February 9th and 10th. When registering, they must present their ID card or citizen card, and the doctor's certificate for patients and the household registration certificate proving the number and age of children must also be submitted for review.</p>
<h3>Grain Bureau Orders All Public Rice Shops to Pay and Release Rice on Time</h3>
<p>The purpose of the city's implementation of food rationing per capita by the City Food Management Office is to resolve the threat to the food supply of the urban area. However, it has been found that the public rice shops in each district that handle food rationing per capita have failed to pay for rice and release rice on time, resulting in the failure to open the ration on time, which is contrary to the purpose of handling food rationing per capita. Therefore, the bureau has yesterday strictly ordered the joint office of public rice shops and the district public offices in each district of the city not to delay in the future, so as not to hinder the implementation of the food policy.</p>
<h3>Hot Water Industry Association Requests Sale of Cheap Coal</h3>
<p>The Hot Water Store Industry Association of this port has previously received a large number of letters from members of the same industry, requesting to implore the authorities to approve the continued sale of cheap coal cinder for hot water, in order to reduce the cost of burning water. The association believes that the points stated by the members are factual and has submitted a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Settlement last month, appealing for the resumption of the sale of cheap coal as soon as possible, at four tons per household per month. At the same time, it also ordered the Yangshupu Water and Electricity Plant to sell the surplus coal directly to the industry association, and the members are responsible for purchasing and distributing it to solve the urgent need. The reporter continued to inquire from the association yesterday and learned that since the association sent the letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council, it has been a week, but it has not yet received a reply from the Shanghai Municipal Council, or it may be delayed until the Lunar New Year to receive a reply. However, the members of the association are all in urgent need of goods and are looking forward to the authorities approving their request and releasing cheap coal as soon as possible, so that they can continue to sell water.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Police Annual Report</h3>
<p>According to the Public Works Department Police Annual Report, the Police Department underwent a comprehensive reorganization last year to improve efficiency. There were a total of thirteen shooting incidents between police officers and bandits, resulting in one officer killed in action and one injured.</p>
<p>Approximately 5,000 Police Officers, Over 200 New Recruits</p>
<p>As of the end of the year, the Police Department had 3,762 Chinese police officers, 302 Japanese police officers, 339 foreign police officers, and 465 Indian police officers. Excluding internal staff, there were 4,028 Chinese, 132 Russian, and 194 Indian officers under the supervision of the Police Department. The Police Department maintained good discipline throughout the year.</p>
<p>Seven Chinese police officers received special merit awards, and three Japanese police officers received awards. In addition, one Russian police officer from the Russian Auxiliary Unit received an award.</p>
<p>A total of 238 new police officers were recruited, including 187 Chinese, 27 Japanese, two foreign, and 22 Indian officers. All underwent training and were assigned to duties. The refresher courses on traffic control, police duties, and drills for Chinese and Indian constables were continuously conducted throughout the year.</p>
<p>Last year, the reserve team was dispatched to deal with one armed robbery case, one labor strike, one tram strike, six armed fights, four bomb throwing cases, one explosion case, four terrorist cases, and six false alarms. They also performed guard patrols and search activities. The overall work efficiency of the team was as outstanding as the previous year.</p>
<p>The Police Department handled 616 cases of lost children.</p>
<p>Taxi Licenses Issued: 400</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War on December 8th of the previous year, the number of vehicles on the road has greatly decreased due to the Bureau's announcement restricting the use of automobiles to save gasoline. Only vehicles with triangular permits are allowed to operate. Many of these vehicles have been retrofitted to burn gasoline substitutes.</p>
<p>As a result of an agreement between the three municipal authorities, private car licenses issued in the concession or the city could be mutually used in the three districts, starting from the beginning of the year. This joint license measure was later extended to private bicycles, starting with a six-month trial period from July 1st. Over 95,000 people attended lectures emphasizing the importance of "Safety First."</p>
<p>In October of last year, the Bureau issued licenses to taxis that burn gasoline substitutes, allowing them to apply for operating permits. By the end of the year, 217 such vehicles had applied for licenses, of which 200 were approved and issued. At the same time, the Municipal Government and the French Concession Municipal Council issued 100 licenses. A total of 489 private and 1,264 public tricycles were licensed. 46,148 bicycle licenses were issued, compared to 53,231 in the previous year. This decrease is because residents of the western Shanghai area now obtain licenses from the Municipal Government, so the number of licenses issued by the Police Department was less than the previous year.</p>
<p>Last year, there were a total of 3,732 traffic accidents on the roads, resulting in deaths, injuries, or property damage, a significant decrease from the previous year. This is due to the sharp decline in the number of automobiles.</p>
<p>Increased Warehouse Rent by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. issued a notice to grain merchants regarding the increase in warehouse rent: Dear Sirs, due to difficult economic conditions and a sharp increase in expenses, the warehouse rent will be revised from February 1, 1943, to 5 jiao in Central Reserve Bank notes per cubic foot for the main warehouse and 4 jiao in Central Reserve Bank notes per cubic foot for the East warehouse. All goods currently stored in our warehouses will be calculated at the new price.</p>
<h3>Tax Revenue for the First Half of This Year Expected to Reach 30 Million Yuan, Increase Expected in Various Tax Revenues</h3>
<p>The total government tax revenue for the first half of this year is expected to reach 340,473,000 yuan due to recent increases in customs and salt tax revenue and revisions to the consolidated tax regulations, which is a significant increase compared to the same period last year. As for expenditures, the first half of this year will reach 600 million yuan. In order to balance revenue and expenditure, the authorities will find ways to modify the tax system. The estimated amount of various tax revenues for the first half of this year is listed below: (1) Customs Duty: 72,000,000 yuan; (2) Salt Tax: 32,700,000 yuan; (3) Consolidated Tax: 181,716,358 yuan; (4) Tobacco Tax: 2,191,600 yuan; (5) Stamp Duty: 2,140,900 yuan; (6) Mining Tax: 2,804,130 yuan; (7) Special Tax: 16,460,000 yuan; (8) Income Tax: 20,400,000 yuan; (9) Transfer Tax: 5,400,000 yuan; (10) Additional Silk Tax: 4,650,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Spring Break for Schools is Approaching Quickly, Scholarships Still Depend on Donations, Many Generous and Righteous People in Shanghai, Cultivating the Younger Generation is of Utmost Importance</h3>
<p>The approved list of students in the sixth grade of primary schools for the 4th Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship is announced today. The junior high school exam papers have been graded, and the high school students' papers are being reviewed. University applicants have been notified in the past two days to come to the office for interviews. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Thousands of Middle School Students Rely on Assistance from All Sectors</h3>
<p>The approved lists of students in the fifth and sixth grades of primary schools have already been announced. More than 1,600 middle school students have applied for scholarships. These students have either lost their parents or come from impoverished families. Who is without feelings? How can we sit idly by? We are deeply grateful for the generous donations of more than 20,000 yuan from all sectors yesterday. In the past ten days or so, we have been appealing to all sectors for donations for students applying for scholarships, because the students are in urgent need of assistance. Scholarship assistance is like putting out a fire. Delaying action for a moment is tantamount to destroying the future of many aspiring young people. We have been entrusted with this important responsibility, and we cannot bear to see these young people lose their schooling due to our insufficient efforts. We hope that people from all walks of life will understand this heart and this wish. The approved list of students for junior and senior high schools will be announced soon. Each additional scholarship awarded means fewer people dropping out of school. All sectors must not bear to see so many young people fall into the sea of suffering of dropping out of school, so saving and rewarding them still depends on donations from all sectors. The goal of this year's 300,000 yuan scholarship fund is also the need of this year's scholarship applicants. We are now less than 100,000 yuan away. We hope that all sectors will generously contribute to complete the scholarship undertaking. This is the good fortune of the students, and also the good fortune of society.</p>
<p>Return Method for Application Documents</p>
<p>The return method for the transcripts and certificates attached by the applicants is as follows: (1) Those who are approved for scholarships will have them returned on the spot when they personally come to the office to collect the scholarship check; (2) Those who are not approved for scholarships will have their transcripts mailed back by this newspaper to avoid the trouble of traveling back and forth. Regarding the pending cases mentioned in the letters from all sectors, they will be submitted to the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Committee for case-by-case decisions. The handling methods will be announced in the coming days.</p>
<p>Scholarships Received Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, the scholarship funds received totaled 2,500 yuan from Rong Feng Textile Company; 2,000 yuan each from Micki, Ching Kee, Tze Kee, Hsin Kee, Wong Kee, and Heng Kee; 1,000 yuan each from Ku Kee, Ching Kee, and Tzu Kee; 500 yuan each from Hsing Kee, Jung Kee, and Wang Tzu-yang; 450 yuan from Chou Yung-ching (extra reward for garden workers); 200 yuan from Chang Mei Kee; 100 yuan each from Chou Keng-hsin and Chang Chi-lai; 60 yuan from Shen Feng-piao (monthly donation); 50 yuan from Hsing Kee; 40 yuan from Hsieh Ho Hsiang Glass Company; 30 yuan from an anonymous person (receipt number 2455); 20 yuan from Tu Tsu-nien; 10 yuan from Ma Ching-chih; totaling 20,060 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. The previous balance was 222,071 yuan, 7 jiao, and 2 fen, leaving a balance of 242,131 yuan, 7 jiao, and 2 fen.</p>
<p>Joint Donation, Generous Surrender of Scholarship</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received a letter from Ku Kee and nine others supporting the Shen Bao's scholarship campaign, jointly contributing 15,000 yuan to benefit the poor students. We admire their generosity immensely. Also, Mr. Tsao Shih-pin wrote a letter stating that if his son is able to obtain a scholarship, he would give it up to benefit others. The letter states: "My son, Tsao Chi-feng, took the scholarship exam of your esteemed association this time without my prior consent. According to the scholarship regulations, it is designed to support poor students. Although my income is not high, I can barely afford the tuition for one son. There is no need to hinder others from seeking educational opportunities. If he fails due to poor grades, I will let it be. If he is admitted, I am willing to give up the scholarship and transfer the amount to help others."</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Assistance, Students' Gratitude</p>
<p>The newspaper received a letter from a street vendor the other day who has been setting aside 1% of his daily earnings from sales to donate. He has now collected more than 200 yuan. His act is deeply meaningful and shows a great eagerness to help. It is admirable that a small vendor, feeling the need for knowledge, has such a righteous act. The letter states: "I am a street vendor, and because of heavy burdens, I have to sell along the streets even in wind and snow. I am now so poor that I don't have enough food for the next day, but my desire for knowledge cannot be stopped by the environment. Since learning last year that your newspaper emphasizes the importance of education and launched a scholarship fund to help young people who have dropped out of school, I, as someone who has been there, deeply know the pain of dropping out of school. At that time, I vowed to do my best to help those with the same suffering. I thought of a way to set aside 1% of my daily business income, a few jiao each day. At first, I thought it would not have much effect, but little by little, it has accumulated to 205.7 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. I respectfully offer it all, but I think of how many wealthy merchants in Shanghai earn no less than tens of thousands every day. If they could donate 1%, the amount would be considerable." Also, Mr. Hsieh Yi-yun wrote in a letter: "I have received gifts from friends for the New Year, and returning them would be contrary to my original intention of not giving gifts. Therefore, I am converting them into cash to donate to your newspaper's scholarship fund, to benefit all my friends. I respectfully enclose 200 yuan and ask that the receipt be written in the names of Fang Yi-ao, Wang Yi-yai, and Pao Yi-hsiao." Also, yesterday we received donation letters from all sectors. Young readers Ma Hsiao-hsin and Hsiao-liang wrote in a letter: "We saw many children who don't have money to go to school and want to help them very much. We also saw that your newspaper has a scholarship fund, so my younger brother and I each donated 20 yuan. This is our allowance for several months. I think, we have food to eat and clothes to wear, what do we need allowance for? When we donated, our father was also next to us, and he agreed very much, so he also took out 60 yuan, making it 100 yuan. We hope to help pay for a child's tuition. If it's not enough, we will definitely have New Year's money in the New Year, and we will come to help again." (2) Mr. Wang Tzu-yang of Hsin Yi Construction Company wrote in a letter: "Our company holds a New Year's banquet every Lunar New Year to thank the colleagues for their hard work. In these difficult times, we can't bear to waste. Therefore, we are saving the banquet expenses of 1,000 yuan, sending 500 yuan to your newspaper and 500 yuan to the Hsin Wen Pao scholarship fund."</p>
<p>The fifth grade primary school scholarship was awarded yesterday. Young students came in the rain, lining up quietly at the payout location, with excellent order.</p>
<p>After the newspaper staff verified that the procedures were in order, they distributed the scholarships according to the approved amounts. The students who received assistance were all delighted. Seeing that they will become talented people in the future and contribute to society, they should drink water and think of the source, and never forget the expectations of the donors from all sectors today. This is what this newspaper repeatedly emphasizes to the students.</p>
<p>The students who receive assistance should be aware of their poverty and strive hard, hoping for excellent grades, which is the glory of the students. But remembering the source, the students should never forget the enthusiasm of the donors from all walks of life.</p>

<h3>Request for Flour Allocation to the Cake and Bun Industry is Still Under Consideration</h3>
<p>Since the Public Works Department modified the flour allocation method, the cake, bun, fried food, and cooked food industries in this city have been greatly affected. The trade associations of these industries petitioned the authorities to revoke the order. The authorities agreed to accept the petition. Yesterday, it was reported that the authorities had approved the allocation of flour to the cake and bun industry. Representatives from other industries have also petitioned the authorities to grant them the same treatment. The reporter specifically visited Mr. Sheng Yu-tu of the Public Works Department yesterday. According to him, the authorities have not formally approved the allocation of flour to the cake and bun industry. The authorities have only agreed to accept the requests from the flour food industry, but are still considering it at length.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Establishes a Permit Office, Selling Prices Will Be Supervised</h3>

<p>Revision of Land Regulations</p>
<p>In September of last year, the Bureau established a subcommittee to discuss the revision of the Land Regulations and its appendices. The committee members were Mr. Okamoto Otsuichi, Mr. Grote, Mr. Godown, and Mr. Xu Jianping. The committee sought the opinions of the heads of various departments and the Legal Department submitted a draft of the new regulations. The committee conducted a thorough review of this matter and provided various opinions to the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Last year, the Bureau drafted several new appendices and amendments, submitted them to the Consular Body for approval, and announced them separately.</p>
<p>Establishment of a Comprehensive Committee</p>
<p>Previously, the Bureau established a Comprehensive Committee on December 11, 1941, in order to integrate the work of various emergency committees and to make quick decisions on various matters. Since its establishment, it has achieved remarkable results. Last year, the Board of Directors of the Bureau believed that in this extraordinary period, the handling of various urgent matters should be expedited so that there would be no need to obtain the approval of the Board of Directors or the Standing Committee. Therefore, the Bureau granted special powers to the Comprehensive Committee to handle all matters. However, matters relating to the Bureau's administrative policies and principles should still be submitted to the Board of Directors and the Standing Committee for approval. Over the past year, the committee has met two or three times to deal with complex matters too numerous to mention. The members of the committee are currently Mr. Okazaki Katsuo (Chairman), Mr. Godown, Mr. Grote, Mr. Ozawa, Mr. Jie, Mr. Kawamura Makoto, and Mr. Bislip (Secretary).</p>
<p>Prohibition of Issuing Vouchers</p>
<p>On June 27th, the Bureau issued a notice prohibiting the issuance of vouchers from the 28th of the same month. All companies and firms should recall all previously issued vouchers before July 11th. When recalling the vouchers, they should be exchanged for cash. Customers should not be forced to exchange them for goods. As for gift certificates issued by department stores, they are still allowed to circulate, because gift certificates are purchased by customers as gifts for relatives and friends. They can be exchanged for items of the same value at the respective companies, which is different from the nature of vouchers.</p>
<p>No Price Increases Allowed</p>
<p>On June 15th, the Bureau issued another notice stating that from June 17th, the retail prices of all items sold in the Public Concession, regardless of their nature or type, should be calculated in Central Reserve Bank currency. The prices converted to Central Reserve Bank currency should not exceed half of the average price calculated in old legal tender from May 26th to 28th. Without the Bureau's approval, no increases should be made without authorization. As for the various items for which the Bureau has set price limits, prices should still be charged in accordance with the provisions of the various notices.</p>
<p>The Bureau also issued a notice on June 10th, stipulating that the retail prices of various items, which had been converted into Central Reserve Bank currency before May 26th, should not be increased without authorization after that date without the Bureau's approval. Violators will be dealt with according to regulations.</p>
<p>Three New Taxes Levied</p>
<p>At the beginning of 1941, the Bureau established a Standing Subcommittee under the Finance Committee, named the New Tax Revenue Subcommittee, to study the implementation of new tax regulations. As a result of repeated discussions, the committee proposed several suggestions for levying new taxes. After consideration by the Bureau, three new taxes were levied in the previous year: the telephone tax, the 10% tax on hotel and teahouse bills, and the 2% tax on retail goods. Before these new tax measures were approved for implementation by the Bureau, they were submitted to the Special Advisory Committee for discussion and received its approval. (End)</p>
<h3>Public Works Department's Price Control Implementation Last Year (January 27th)</h3>
<p>Questioning Procedure Similar to Court</p>
<p>All cases, which are suspected by Investigation Team lawyer to have violated the regulations, are transferred to the Price Control Implementation Group for review. The Price Control Implementation Group currently has five lawyers who are responsible for handling the interrogation matters of the cases. The interrogation procedure is similar to that of a court. All those suspected of violating the regulations have the opportunity to defend themselves and are allowed to go to the Bureau for questioning with a lawyer. They may also apply to the Executive Committee for reconsideration, and then be summoned for questioning again. At that time, they are allowed to submit new evidence on the original decision of the Executive Committee.</p>
<p>Executive Committee Serves as Judge</p>
<p>The judgment of the case is made by the aforementioned Executive Committee. The committee is supervised by the Director-General of the Bureau. The committee members include two Bureau directors and one senior police officer. The committee gives special consideration to each case in light of the circumstances, and tries its best to avoid unfairness. However, if the committee obtains sufficient evidence to prove that the violator has indeed violated the regulations and has engaged in conduct that harms the public interest, it will not hesitate to punish them.</p>
<p>Scope of Work Expanding</p>
<p>The scope of the Commodity Control Office is expanding day by day. Therefore, the important work of the Investigation and Price Control Branch is also increasing. The most urgent task of the department now is to crack down on speculation and black market transactions. In the future, the penalties for such transactions will be extremely severe in order to eliminate the main factors that disrupt people's livelihood. Through this organization, the Bureau will work with other authorities that currently control many major commodities, such as cooking oil, matches, soap, candles, etc., to improve people's livelihood. It is hoped that for their own benefit, the citizens will fully cooperate with the Bureau and support the Bureau's measures to improve people's livelihood. (End)</p>

<p>Yesterday was one of the last days for the government bond market, and prices turned strong. People's sentiment was quite good, but there were not many transactions. Because there was a slight need, the trend went up. There were very few sellers. Buyers are preparing to wait until after the Lunar New Year to see the situation. The trend within the year may not be easy to fall back. Yesterday, Grade C started at 9 yuan, with small prices down to 8 yuan and 80 cents. Later, there were too few sellers.

The distribution of oil according to the number of people is still in progress.</p>
<h3>New Silver Dollar Square Ingot: Uneven Quality</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were only scattered transactions of new silver dollars, new silver squares, and new silver ingots. Wholesale business is still difficult to move. The market is actually affected by uneven quality and is difficult to prosper. Moreover, coarse quality is rarer than fine quality, so the market is also uneven. More than seven-tenths of coarse quality must be sold at 24,000 yuan per ton. Two-tenths to six-tenths new silver yuan squares are sold at 16,000 yuan per ton. New silver ingots are priced at 20,000 yuan per ton (quality is added appropriately). New triangular iron is 24,000 yuan per ton. Zhenghao hacksaw blades are 45,000 yuan per ton. Circle head soft steel road skin is 30,000 yuan per ton. Jianpi light brand steel is 17,000 yuan per ton. Tobacco skin head is 30,000 yuan per ton.

<h3>Tobacco Exchange Association Market Officially Reopens</h3>
<p>The market of the Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Association has been automatically closed since the beginning of December of last year because the market prices of cigarettes and daily necessities have been manipulated by speculation and continue to rise. The persons in charge of the industry association are deeply afraid that the rising momentum will be unlimited, so the industry transaction can only be carried out informally outside the market. It has been two months now. The association has been actively preparing all the reopening procedures since the end of last year, such as re-registering the industry in the city, re-issuing new passes, revising market rules, and electing 18 market supervisors. By the 26th of last month, everything had been prepared, so the reopening was informal, but it only lasted for one day and was banned by the authorities. The industry association authorities deeply felt that this would not be a good policy in the long run, so they strongly requested the authorities to allow the market to officially reopen. It is now known that the authorities have accepted the request of the industry association, so the market of the industry association has announced its official reopening since yesterday. After the reopening, the various transaction methods will remain the same as before, but 15 market supervisors will be re-elected to take office, and the authorities will also send personnel to the market to supervise, so the transactions of cigarettes and daily necessities can always be brought into the right track.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes Turn Firm and Strong Again</h3>
<p>The cigarette market, the prices of British and American goods have turned firm and strong, and the prices are still moving upwards. The rise in Japanese and domestic cigarettes is still slow. Great Britain brand is 13,100 yuan, Old Gold is 10,650 yuan, Pinhai is 7,800 yuan, Wuhua is 6,800 yuan, Little Fairy is 8,150 yuan, Japanese cigarettes Golden Gun is 3,000 yuan, Golden Building is 3,800 yuan, Red Rose is 2,600 yuan, Quanlu brand is 3,600 yuan, Nianzhi is 3,100 yuan, Guide brand is 2,850 yuan, domestic cigarettes Pyramid is 6,700 yuan, Beauty brand is 6,100 yuan, Golden Mouse is 4,150 yuan, Platinum Dragon is 4,500 yuan, all of which have risen compared to the weekend.</p>
<h3>Soap and Candle Sales Are Quiet</h3>
<p>The daily necessities market is quiet in terms of sales, and prices are stable. Phoenix brand matches are 4,000 yuan, Beauty brand is 4,200 yuan, Golden Tripod brand is 3,400 yuan, miscellaneous brands are 2,250 yuan, Tongmu soap is 780 yuan, White Xiangmao soap is 720 yuan, Yellow Xiangmao soap is 650 yuan, Scissors soap is 740 yuan, White Label candle is 560 yuan, Monk Hat brand is 480 yuan, and miscellaneous brands are 340 yuan. All are reported to be stable.</p>
<h3>Everyday Medicines Are Firm</h3>
<p>The selling prices of everyday medicines continue to rise, because hoarders are collecting them without sparing any effort. Those who hold the goods are also firmly holding on and intend to sell them at good prices after the start of spring, so the market presents a trend of rising without falling. Headache powder is 40 yuan, Balm is 54 yuan, Bagua Dan is 48 yuan, Partridge Tea is 76 yuan, Dragon Tiger Ren Dan is 47 yuan, all of which have risen.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Canned Food Market</h3>
<p>— Hua Yun</p>
<p>The Association Makes Every Effort to Suppress the Black Market: Distribution Will Continue After the Spring Festival</p>
<p>Since the Greater East Asia War, imported canned food has been subject to control by the authorities. Except for agricultural products, fruits, and vegetables, which are allowed to move freely, other marine products such as scaled, shelled, and shelled seafood and poultry and livestock meat must be transferred to the authorities in charge (the Food Section of the Embassy Office) to request the issuance of a movement permit before they can be moved. At the same time, due to insufficient inventory and declining sources, there are occasional shortages. And European and American goods will disappear, causing prices to rise repeatedly. No matter what kind of goods, they are very popular. Fellow traders and non-industry hoarders have been searching and purchasing in various ways, and high prices have been seen repeatedly. The market conditions for canned food, which have never had much ups and downs, have actually been rising day and night.</p>
<p>In April of last spring, with the assistance of the United Association of Japanese Importers and Distributors of Friend Nations in Central China, and with the approval of the competent authorities, the Shanghai Special Municipality Bottled and Canned Food Industry Association was organized, with its headquarters located at 759 Jiujiang Road in the city. Since its establishment, it has first sought to solve the problem of supply of goods, and has made great efforts to dredge the source to the authorities concerned. On one side, it has promoted the rationing system and openly rationed it in newspapers. The market conditions once tended to stabilize. Afterwards, due to the small number of goods dispatched, there were too few porridge and too many monks, which was not enough for distribution. It has also aroused the black market and dark trading, and some illegal fellow traders have cooperated with those who have strong connections to raise prices and search for goods, and even asked third-country foreign merchants to buy them in large quantities from Hongkou. As a result, the supply quantity of the United Association? The number of public allocations has decreased day by day. The goods of the Association and the Friendly Association's sales combination are all supplied by the United Association. Japanese canners in Hongkou prevent resale and hoarding and do not sell to Chinese merchants, while general illegal speculative traders use foreign brokers to buy from them in order to fulfill their desire for hoarding, and they get high prices and reap huge profits. On one side, they requested the combination to allocate them again, causing a panic that the inventory of the United Association was running out. Based on the above factors, it stimulated the black market and created an unprecedented record of dark trading. For example, a box of three-dozen 550-watt Tonghe films of pineapple was only 3 cents of French currency per hearing before the incident, but now the black market is actually trading at more than 600 yuan per box, which is difficult to buy. Compared with the association's allocation price of only 212 yuan and 10 cents per box, the difference is as much as more than 400 yuan. It is indeed a shocking initiative. It is heard that the association has requested the United Association to prohibit the resale of private goods and to notify all friendly association members.</p>
<p>Although the association has only been in existence for more than eight months since its establishment, it has made its best efforts to openly distribute goods, and there have been four phases. The most recent fifth batch of allocation goods has been agreed by the United Association to supply a large number of goods. In order to help the authorities suppress prices and eliminate the black market, it has been decided to openly distribute after the Spring Festival, and the method of improving the allocation is now being studied. As for the prices, there is still no change. After that, the black market transactions will probably be severely hit. Although it is now the end of the old lunar year, the market is still very firm. The recent market prices are listed on the left:</p>
<p>All of the above are the official standard products, so the selling price is the same regardless of the brand.</p>
<h3>Group A Cooking Oil Retail Stores: Continue to Sell Oil for Two Days Starting Yesterday. No Confirmation on Distribution Based on Population.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cooking Oil Industry Distribution Office, in order to meet the needs of citizens for cooking oil during the Lunar New Year, has purchased approximately 2,000 piculs of cooking oil from the military authorities and distributed it to the Group A cooking oil retail stores throughout the city. The sales have been continued for two days starting yesterday (1st) and will be sold out today (2nd). As for whether the oil sales will continue to be divided into Group A and B or whether the oil will be distributed according to the number of people, there is no confirmation yet.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>On the Principles of Division of Labor and Cooperation</h3>
<p>— Yale</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Chunqiu's article "Work and Remuneration" in "Free Talk," I would like to express some thoughts from the perspective of young professionals. Indeed, the disproportion between work and remuneration is a common phenomenon in various industrial and commercial organizations. Mr. Chunqiu has already provided concrete descriptions, and I do not wish to add to them. However, the unreasonableness of work and remuneration leads me to think about the issue of "division of labor and cooperation."</p>
<p>In any enterprise with a considerable scale, there are departments for internal and external affairs. Each department has a person in charge and staff members. The powers and responsibilities are different and divided. This distinction in the nature of work is what is called "division of labor." Whether handling routine official matters or related affairs, there are certain steps from beginning to completion. During the process, there must be contact between departments and between personnel, whether in writing or verbally. This mutual contact and cooperative form is what is called "cooperation." In short, in any enterprise, there are rules for division of labor and cooperation, and the practitioners have the same goal. The saying "different routes to the same destination" can represent a concrete explanation of "division of labor and cooperation."</p>
<p>The above is just an outline of "division of labor and cooperation." In fact, analyzed in detail, division of labor is related to technical issues, and cooperation is related to personnel issues. Technology is the prerequisite for division of labor, and personnel is the prerequisite for cooperation. However, technology cannot be separated from personnel, and personnel cannot be separated from technology. The two are interdependent. Only when there are no problems in technology and personnel are handled appropriately can the effect of division of labor and cooperation be fully achieved.</p>
<p>What is meant by division of labor being a technical problem, to put it plainly, is the problem of "using people." Because there are many different types of work in an enterprise, it is necessary to distinguish techniques in terms of employment. After technical differentiation, division of labor begins. However, the beginning of division of labor is quite difficult because there are no established rules to follow. This requires careful consideration of the issues of "choosing people according to the task" and "exploring tasks according to the person" in the future, to ensure that all talents are used appropriately. When talents are used appropriately, it conforms to the principle of division of labor. Then, situations such as "disproportionate remuneration and work" and "busy people are too busy, idle people are too idle" that hinder business should also be resolved through fair measures.</p>
<p>What is meant by cooperation being a personnel problem is that any enterprise requires cooperation between superiors and subordinates, and the main condition for cooperation lies in personnel. Proper personnel management can avoid many overt or covert disputes, enabling everyone to have genuine sincerity in cooperation and generating a spirit of mutual cooperation. However, in the matter of cooperation, those in leadership positions must have a rationalized personnel management structure, but practitioners must also have the virtue of being dedicated to their duties. Many practitioners in industry and commerce do not understand that cooperation is a mandatory duty and are very casual about their duties. If this does not affect the overall situation or burden other colleagues, that is fine. Otherwise, due to personal irresponsibility, lack of the virtue of cooperating with others, and lack of the necessary discipline in service, the entire profession is often prone to direct and indirect losses.</p>
<p>Obstacles are naturally unavoidable in the conduct of any business. However, division of labor and cooperation are important issues in any enterprise that cannot be ignored. Therefore, I humbly present its general outline, hoping that wise leaders and outstanding practitioners in industry and commerce will work together.</p>
<h3>Impressions of "Begonia"</h3>
<p>— Qinmin</p>
<p>The play "Begonia" is quite long, taking up four hours and twenty minutes in the theater. While watching the play, I often noticed the expressions, sighs, and tears of the surrounding audience. This can very well explain how this play gripped the audience's heartstrings. But to me, it seemed like just revisiting a familiar story. In my childhood, I often liked to run around amusement parks: a warlord, a performer, an oppressed concubine, and a treacherous and wicked adjutant, plus some arrangement of joys and sorrows, and thus a tragic, lingering, and heart-wrenching drama was formed. At that time, I was indeed deceived into shedding quite a few tears, but as soon as I walked out of the theater door, wiped away my tears, I forgot everything, and I would never think about it again after returning home. This performance of "Begonia" is nothing more than that, except that "Begonia" has a tighter structure and has undergone formal rehearsals. Therefore, it is superior to those variety show civilization dramas in terms of quality, and at the same time, it exerts greater power in moving the audience!</p>
<p>In short, from this performance, we can see that both the script and the director paid great attention to the audience's reaction. Like in the third act, Ji Zhaoxiong's accusation of the relationship between Qiuhaitang and Luo Xiangqi, the on-the-spot coercion, crying, and beating were enough to make the audience feel very excited and tense, and the final reunion and happy ending are the most welcome to the psychology of the petty bourgeoisie. I admire the author and director of "Begonia" for understanding the psychology of the audience and achieving success; but I also regret that their success is only a success in terms of audience numbers. They have indeed attracted those audiences who often run to variety shows and the New World to the Carlton. But is such attraction an improvement? I think that even the most business-minded drama directors and actors cannot but admit that drama should include the meaning of educating the audience and raising the audience's standards! So, will this performance of "Begonia" be of any help to the future of drama? Will it make today's drama take the path of decline like the previous Ai Mei dramas? I think these are all questions worth considering.</p>
<p>Speaking of the actors, Shi Hui's Qiuhaitang in the first half was not dashing enough, the second half was more of a play where he could发挥 his acting skills. Although restricted by the script, his acting skills were generally solid and mature. Shen Min's acting has improved slightly compared to before, and she was able to express Luo Xiangqi's dignified and graceful demeanor quite well. However, her consistently flat tone when reading her lines needs to be changed. Yingzi is still working hard, but I think her understanding of the role of Mei Bao is not very accurate. Mei should have two sides to her personality: on the one hand, she is infected with the lively style of a female student, and on the other hand, because of her background, environment, and other reasons, she should be precocious and melancholic, while Yingzi's performance makes her too "hard" and not enough to arouse sympathy.</p>
<h3>Reading "The Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars" (6)</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>——To My Daughter</p>
<p>But since this is the case, why do people all over the world, from ancient times to the present, rarely add any derogatory terms to those parents, but only advise children to be filial? Originally, there are some incomprehensible things, such as when a woman encounters rape, the formula on the rape side cannot avoid the sudden rise of lascivious thoughts, leading to many things. The commentators afterwards always do not blame the rape, but only ask whether the woman has surrendered, to determine whether to write poems and compose fu to praise or to punish her by being despised by mankind. But that is rape, and it is really excusable to rarely reason with rape. Why do you take the same attitude towards the occasion of parents? Is it not a hidden concern for the world and people's hearts that parents are so cruel, harsh, and abuse their children? It is already a tragic thing that children's age and intelligence are limited, and they cannot escape the net of the family; those who make up stories also take this to teach, advising people to be filial to answer is simply intentionally persuading children to surrender to violence. Childhood habits become nature, and habits become natural. In this way, what is learned from childhood will definitely be a docile slave accustomed to kneeling to the powerful when they grow up. This may be exactly what the storytellers intended, because it is beneficial to him and the emperor and the rich. However, Chinese people can become emperors and the rich, and foreigners can also come to China to become emperors and the rich. Some people say that the Chinese people have a weak national concept and are good at flattering foreigners, etc. In fact, this is not entirely true. Foreign forces can come to China, needless to say, it is always power. Kneeling to power has long been a habit? There is also no time to distinguish between Chinese or foreign. If you don't mind stretching it too far, then tell me how much relationship those brilliant stories have with the emergence of traitors and obedient people today, I am afraid it is not an excessive exaggeration.</p>
<p>"Wu Chuwen Lu" has not been flipped for many years, and there are no books on hand, so based on the impression I saw a few years ago, the discussions on filial piety inside are generally agreeable. Lu Xun's saying about "governing the world with filial piety" in "Wei Jin Demeanor and the Relationship between Medicine and Wine" is also very insightful. You may wish to recommend it to readers. As for me, I feel that since the family system still exists and social changes cannot be completed in a day or two, and the family economy is in the hands of the parents, and the parents probably all love their children, then today, entrusting our nation's future masters to others is not as suitable as entrusting them to their respective parents.</p>
<p>The scholars and professors of today have a wonderful theory, saying that filial piety is youth culture, and detailed discussions are rare, and I don't quite understand what the reason is. Filial piety is naturally all about youth, but if you look at some of the unhealthy creations in the Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars, filial piety does not seem to be youth culture, but a culture that makes youth suffer and suffer. And the gentlemen who make this wonderful theory are no longer young, and they are sitting high in a chair to guide the youth and receive the worship of the youth. It is not difficult to figure out how much correctness there is in their words. (Reward for poverty relief)</p>
<h3>"One Heart and One Virtue" and "Perseverance"</h3>
<p>— Junhao</p>
<p>"One heart and one virtue" can be replaced by "concentration," and "perseverance" can be replaced by "persistence." Originally, when doing the same thing, why does he get 100% results; but I am always not as good as him, and even achieve nothing. Does his success have some mysterious magic? Or does he have his own unique genius? In fact, he is a person, and I am also a person; he has five sense organs and four limbs, and I have not lost anything either. The reason why he succeeded is really because he knows how to be "concentrated" and "persevering."</p>
<p>To be concentrated, you must first start with perseverance and composure. Perseverance is the cultivation of will, and composure is the cultivation of action. After being well-cultivated in these two aspects, you can enter the realm of concentration. Because the road to success is not only full of vines and thorns, but also full of all kinds of dazzling and charming temptations, this temptation will shake your will at all times and make you doubt your original goal. At that time, you will step into a fork in the road, and your persevering will and calm actions will immediately break up with you. Without a persevering will and calm actions, you cannot talk about concentration. Finally, it will make you helpless, and you will see others rise straight to the top, but you are still failing in the exam.</p>
<p>Perseverance is persistence. I don't know how many articles have been written about the benefits of persistence in doing things. However, the cultivation of perseverance is indeed not an easy task. People often say: so-and-so does things well, but unfortunately he has no perseverance. Indeed, there are too many people in the world who start strong and finish weak; and all those who start strong and finish weak, who have a beginning and no end, will never achieve anything in their work, let alone any great achievements. What exactly are the prerequisites for perseverance? On the one hand, you must be able to not be dominated by the environment; on the other hand, you must bury yourself in advancing towards a goal. In the meantime, you need the spirit of hard work and endurance, as well as the attitude of courage and diligence. With the spirit of hard work and endurance, you can have a body that has been tempered thousands of times, thereby overcoming the environment to the point of dominating the environment; with the attitude of courage and diligence, you can have the mood to work hard and do hard work, thereby overcoming obstacles and moving towards a bright future.</p>
<h3>The Teacher of All Ages</h3>
<p>— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>(10) (1)</p>
<p>Suddenly, a series of thoughts surged in, pressing so tightly that Chips could not open his mouth, and could only answer to himself. What did these exams and checks have to do with anything? What did all this efficiency and modernization have to do with anything? Ralston managed Brookfield like a factory - a factory to produce a snobbish culture based on money and machinery.</p>
<p>The traditions of the old families and vast fields are changing, no doubt they must change; but Ralston does not expand them into a true democracy, including both aristocrats and commoners, but narrows them into a thick bank account. There have never been so many rich kids at Brookfield, the garden party on the day of the speech is like Ascot. Ralston met those rich men in various clubs in London, and seduced them, saying that Brookfield was exactly the school for advancement; since they could not use money to buy their way into Eton or Harrow, they greedily swallowed this bait. Some of them are extraordinary like伙—although others are normal. Financiers, company founders, pill manufacturers. One of them gave his son five pounds a week as pocket money. Vulgarity... exaggeration... but everything consumes corruption and maturity... Once, Chips told a joke about a student named Isaaestein and his ancestors, so he got into trouble. That student wrote home about it, and old Isaaestein wrote an angry letter to Ralston. Irritable, no sense of humor, no sense of proportion - that's all these new guys are... No sense of proportion. Especially more important than everything is the sense of proportion, which is what Brookfield should teach. Not so much Latin or Greek, or chemistry, or arithmetic. You can't hand out test papers to them, give them certificates, and test this sense of proportion... (28)</p>

<h3>Fellow Villagers of the Laochan District Baojia Donate to Elementary School Teachers' Medical Aid Fund</h3>
<p>The heavy responsibilities and sighed magnitude of the mission of elementary school teachers, and the meager treatment they receive, are recognized by the public. In the face of rising living costs at sea, elementary school teachers earn only one or two hundred gold per month. How will they cope with this living environment? If they unfortunately suffer from illness, they will inevitably suffer from poverty and disease. The emotions of their groans and pain cannot be described in words. The purpose of this newspaper's initiation of the "Elementary School Teachers' Medical Aid Fund" is to stimulate human sympathy and provide practical assistance to poor teachers. Yesterday, we received a generous donation of 500 gold from the fellow villagers of the Laochan District Baojia, along with a sincere letter. Their kindness is very grateful. The original letter said: "Your newspaper has a long history and pure opinions. It is the mouthpiece of the people and can do its best to advocate for social charities, benefiting the people greatly. We deeply admire it. Now your newspaper has initiated the Elementary School Teachers' Medical Aid Fund, and we express our sympathy all the more. The importance of the status of elementary school teachers and the hardship of their lives cannot be believed by those who have not experienced it firsthand, even if they are told. They work hard all day, and they are still worried about their own food and clothing, let alone supporting their parents and raising their children. Once they are invaded by illness, where will the consultation fees and medicine expenses come from? The painful situation must not be describable in words. Your newspaper, in view of this, pioneered the medical aid fund to benefit elementary school teachers. We will do our best to follow in your footsteps, and we hope that social leaders and people from all walks of life will respond, so that poor elementary school teachers will not be forced by poverty and illness, and affect their sacred work. Then, the beneficiaries will be directly the elementary school teachers, and indirectly our children. Now, we are enclosing 500 gold, which is saved from our daily expenses, to express our support. Sincerely, the fellow villagers of the Third Bao of the Fourth Sun Bao of the Lao Zha District."</p>
<h3>Tuberculosis Lecture (1) The Most Dangerous Age of Life</h3>
<p>Germany's lung examinations for university students are very strict. Between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five, they must undergo mandatory examinations. The results found that active tuberculosis accounted for 0.5 to 1.8%, inactive tuberculosis accounted for 27%, and various tuberculosis phenomena were found to increase with age, until the age of twenty-five. The most numerous phenomena of various early symptoms were at the age of twenty-two. Therefore, young people around the age of twenty can be regarded as the most dangerous period of life. All young people in this period should undergo strict X-ray examinations to prevent them, which is the key to lifelong health and happiness.</p>
<h3>Anti-British and American Association Scholarship Registration Deadline Today</h3>
<p>After the recent heavy snow, followed by overcast rain, coupled with the biting cold wind, the skin feels like it is about to crack. The students who registered had to wade back and forth, which was very hard. Fearing that due to the long distance, inconvenient transportation, or other accidents, they could not register as scheduled, the Anti-British and American Association Scholarship Office has extended it for two days, so that they have enough time to handle it calmly. It is heard that the association has decided to close the registration at 4:00 pm today (2nd). This is the last day, and those who have not registered are requested to hurry up and handle it, so as not to delay themselves. Applications will not be accepted after the deadline. As for the examination date and location, they are currently being negotiated. Once they are ready, they will be published in this newspaper.</p>
