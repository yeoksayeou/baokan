<p>社評</p>
<h3>中國必須迅速工業化</h3>
<p>「工業發達者，其國富强」。這句話已成爲近世紀立國的準則。我國號稱以農立國，向無工業規模可言，迨至　淸末年，始有曾李　導機器了業，迄今雖已有數十年歷史，但因固步自封，不求精進，發展甚緩。猶之競走，人則飛奔疾進，我在牛步徐行；人乘飛行機，我坐獨輪車，其瞠乎落後，爲必然的結果；國勢貧弱，也有其必　的原因了。我們痛定思痛，今後必須急起直追，以完成「中國工業化」爲建設新中國的中心目標。</p>
<p>「地大，物博，人衆」，固然是大賦中國　厚處，爲什麼我們有了這樣優渥的憑藉，而今大成了那樣的貧弱呢？簡單的說，因爲我們不會運用地利，物力和人力，所以把　個「得天獨厚」的天然條件，埋沒在自滿自嘲的顢預氛圍裏，而被人稱爲「睡獅」。當　滴者生存的世界競技塲裏，我們更需要趕快猛醒，迎　趕上，促進新中國的工業化。</p>
<p>有人說：目前我們正在與盟邦協力參戰，應集中一切致力於戰事，而倡言中國工業化，毋寗是不合時宜的高調。誠然。爭取戰事勝利，決定於總力，而經濟力量，則佔總力中的重要地位。我　參戰，同時　要興業建國，所以提倡中國工業化，不但不是高調，而是當務之急。</p>
<p>不過一個落後的農業國家，要急切變成工業國家，問題却不是簡單，而工作又十分繁重。我們不妨貢獻若干初步的意見：</p>
<p>首先，需要擬訂詳盡的計劃，它的內容，以全國性爲基礎，適應各地域的特產，氣候等資源與天然條件，以確定工業門類。重工業與輕工業之依求關係，滴當佈置。並顧及交通運輸之便捷，同時規定逐步實施之期限，儘最可能之速度完成之。是項計劃，由政府延聘各部門中日專家，以及各工業門類之代表，組織委昌會，討論擬訂，以期學理與實騐配合，收執行順利之效。擬成草案後，擇其可公開者發表之，廣徵民間意見，集思廣益，以臻最合理，最完善之地步。旣經訂定，即須排除萬難，澈底實施。</p>
<p>其次，明確規定國營與民營之範圍，不能生利而資本雄厚者，應歸國營，大致重工業，基本工業，以國營爲宜。民營工業已有基礎者，政府非不得已不收回國營。政府不以利潤爲目的，而與民爭利。</p>
<p>第三，國營工業必須有合理之組織機構，充分利用生產設備，提高生產效率，重用專門技術人材，並調整　管理職務，而只會做官，不會做事的人，絕對不許挿足工業圈裏，成爲害羣之馬。</p>
<p>第四，中央政府設置主管工業專部，工作重心，爲執行整個工業化計劃，統轄國營工業，並監督指導民營工業，對於民營工業，注意其技術上之改進，生產效率之增加，資金之貸　，產品運輸之便利。</p>
<p>第五，培養工業專鬥人材，敎育部門，以工業技術科系爲主體，大學减少文科，法科學額，中學提高數理科目水準，獎勵學生研習實科，以做工程師爲榮。技藝訓練班，尤應多設，一切孤兒院，難童院等，失去監護的兒童，盡量授以技藝，養成大量技工。</p>
<p>第六，改善工人待遇，保障工人生活，發展工人本身的組織，並令工人有參加生產管理之機會。同時，合理縮短工作時間，加强工作强度，加多輪班次數，採用工作競賽，誘發好勝心理，提高工作效率。</p>
<p>綜而言之，完成工業化，雖是千頭萬緒，責重事繁，但能提綱挈領，按步就班，持之以恒，堅毅不回，終有一日，水到渠成。語云：「有志者，事竟成」。我們再看友邦日本，今日之强盛，莫非由於工業之發達，也僅近數十年間之奮鬥成功。百尺竿頭，事在人爲，願與國人共勉之。</p>

<h3>對印英軍之新痛擊</h3>
<p>據八日大本營　表：日本陸軍部隊，自佔據印緬國境附近阿樟布北方地區後，於去年十二月下旬以來，曾擊破印英軍二個師團的攻勢，今年三月上旬，展開大包圍作戰，在馬酉河畔，把敵軍的主力，加以俘獲和擊滅，目下芷在掃蕩殘敵中。</p>
<p>回顧在大東亞戰爭勃發小久之後，日軍開始進攻緬甸，僅經四月有餘，即將英渝聯軍，完全從緬甸擊潰，使敵茫然自失，這個敎訓，誰都不會比敵人自己記憶得更加深刻的。可是，敵人不知自悔，猶自呼號「奪回緬甸」，竟以號稱印英軍中最强的第十四師爲基幹，驅其部隊，越過印度國境，向着日軍之前，逞其蠢動。而此印英軍中的最强部隊，由於日軍的善謀勇戰，又不得小蒙受了殲滅的打擊。此役給予敵方戰略的損失，當屬極大；同時，給予敵方將士，更給予印度民衆，以精神的打擊，必極深刻，不難想像而知。</p>
<p>敵人英國，自去年十月以來，頻頻宣傳其即將發動「奪回緬甸」之積極攻勢，大放厥詞，竟謂：「日軍正忙於太平洋和新幾內亞方面的戰鬥……現在正是攻擊緬甸日軍的絕好機會」。故敵方之以誇稱印英軍中最强的部隊爲基幹，越過印度國境而來者，可視爲亦係基於如上之觀察的。然而在緬甸日軍的陣容，實係精强的部隊，加之，全緬人民，完全諒解日本的眞意，對於日軍的作戰，無不由　協力，使敵絕無可乘機會。</p>
<p>一方面，關於敵人的戰鬥行動如何，則如谷萩陸軍報道部長所稱：「英軍例由印兵擋　陣，自己常居後方担當督戰任務，如見戰况不利，輒先退却」。敵人英國，二百數十年業，從未間斷，對印度人濫施其榨取，壓迫，現在英國雖巳瀕於滅亡　　，而他們猶依然加印度人以鐵鏈，把印度人當作英兵的楯牌，繼續其絕望的戰爭。印度兵中，覺悟其與日軍戰鬥之愚，向日軍投降者，爲數很多，乃屬當然的事。印度民衆，應完全認識英軍的殘虐，避免其成爲英軍楯牌之愚。印度與緬甸相通，若印度人決意避免其爲英軍的犧牲，則其光明前途，便在目前。</p>
<p>抑且，在緬的日軍，此次又舉其煊　的戰果者，實爲日軍僅少的前進部隊，善謀勇戰，亘續二月，阻止敵軍的大部隊，以及其間後續中力部隊之敏活的海上機動和踏被海拔二，三千公尺的阿拉干險峻等，克服了想像不到的困難所致。對於這樣忠勇果敢的將士之苦勞，日本國內後方一億國民，眞不知應該怎樣表示其感謝感激之忱的。</p>
<p>對於渝方所提增加物資運輸的要求，英美乃以奪回緬甸爲前提條件，作爲解消渝方的焦躁和苦　之唯一口實，同時，英美自身，也深知「奪回緬甸」一事所包含之政戰兩局的重要性。可是，同時，他們所呼號之「奪回緬甸」，現在恐怕，不會不知道在戰略上完全不可能。不過美國陸長史汀生和英軍首腦部，則仍以這樣的話來騙過：「因　雨季到來，又因爲輸送英國大軍的困難之故，在今春之中要奪回緬甸，殆不可能」。在種種意味上，緬甸現在已完全是共榮圏中堅牢的一環，對於地域相接的印度軍和雲南瑜軍，更形成了日軍的巨大牙城，堪予敵人以痛烈的打擊。（丁：譯自四月十日每日新聞社論）</p>
<h3>訪日任務完畢　陳公博特使飛返京　昨晋謁汪主席報告訪日經過　與日當局懇談此行結果圓滿</h3>
<p>南京十八日中央社電　我國民政府自參戰以來，友邦即交還各地專管相界，北京公使館區域，及　廢物資移動限制等，對我國完成獨立自主及確立戰時體制，予以種種援助，國府爲表示謝意，並就完遂戰爭問題，與日本當局作坦白懇談，爲特派立法院院長陳公博爲訪日特使。陳特使奉令訪日後，即於本月六日上午十時半偕同隨員外交部駐滬辦事處處長孫理甫，上海特別市政府參事沈觀準，宣傳部參事黃菩生，立法院簡任秘書林基等，離京啟程赴日。陳氏在日，歷訪谷部　臣，舉行種種懇談，並於八日覲見日皇，榮獲旭日大綬章。十一日陳特使以任務完畢，隨即晋宮辭行，轉　返國，途經北京，略事勾留，業於昨（十八日）日下午二時三十五分偕同隨員等由平乘機飛返首都。前往機塲歡迎者，計有立法院秘書長彭義明，宣　部長林柏生，建設部長陳君慧，經理總監著總監何炳賢，外交部决長周隆庠，首都警察總監署總監鄧祖禹，新任駐日大使蔡培鑫，銓叙部長趙毓松，中央靑年幹校副敎育長劉仰山，行政院副秘書長麥蘭溪，首都最高法院長張韜，第一　軍總司令李長江，（代表）立法院委員吳圖南，及立法院全體同人。陳特使下機後，丰采颯爽，與歡迎者頷首爲禮，陳氏　乘車逕赴主席官邸晋謁主席，報吿訪日經過。</p>
<p>南京十八日中央社電　國民政府立法院院長兼上海特別市市長陳公博氏，此次以國府訪日特派大使資格，于本月六日赴日訪問，在日歷時週餘，分別與東條首相以下日政府首腦，開誠交換意見，　果甚爲圓滿。歸國途　，並赴北京小憇，本日已搭機返京，當即晋謁汪主席，詳細報吿此行成果。按國府此次特派陳氏訪日，在中國參戰後，尙屬百次，故不僅已將中國之新情勢，廣爲傳佈興日本朝野，使之得更新之認識，日更足使國府參戰後之中日關係，亦步入更新之階段。陳特使以國府中樞要人，奉派赴日，就中日共同完成戰爭方業，及今後中日關係等各問題，與日政府首腦，開誠懇談，自必獲有相當成果，故今後中日兩國，固將展開完成共同戰爭之新局面，而陳特使復可以視察日本高度戰時體制之寳貴體騐，貢獻于國府之戰時施策。在軍事政治經濟文化等各方面，强力推進新設施，此實尤可有莫大期待。</p>
<p>南京十八日中央社電　國府特派訪日大使陳公博氏抵京下機後，記者特叩詢同行隨員宣傳部參事黃菩生氏，關於戰時體制下日本現狀，承發表感言如左：『此次隨陳特使公博先生訪日，備受日本之隆重歡迎，可見今次中日關係之緊密，情如手足，實非筆墨所能形容者。我國自參加大東亞戰爭，日本已視我國不特爲友，目視中國爲兄弟，今次咬還租界及廢除不平等條的已表示其眞切道義之情，決心援助中國爲獨立自主之國家，自不待言，當今戰爭期中，日本國民無不刻苦耐勞，舉國一致以求大東亞戰爭之完遂。余到福岡以至東京等地，所見日本一般國民均踴躍實行防空演習，婦女均穿防空制服，精神奕奕，極爲欣佩，陳特使所經之地，各街道市民無不立正敬禮，此可見日本國民　中國之熱情，使吾人不能不感激者』。</p>
<h3>在北京接見記者</h3>
<p>北京十八日中央社電　國府訪日特派大使陳公博氏，於十七日下午四時半，在此間中南海勤政殿接見記者　，答　該團所是各問題，力言中國參戰後，中央對北方四省三市期待至殷，茲錄問答大意如次：問，對戰時下日本之印　如何？答，日本上下一致抱必勝信念，其緊張情形深可感動，日本之配給制度，至爲完備，故全　國民在生活上，絕無何等不安，此實尤爲余所欽佩者，問，華北糧食問題之解決方策爲何？答，中國過去之糧食生產，即不能自給目足，此並非僅爲北方各省市如此，昔日中國每年平　輸人白米千六百萬担，麵粉及小麥九百餘萬担，現因輸入不如過去順利，故正就增產及其他方法講求對策中，首應先謀南北物資交流暢通，以期緩和糧食之困難狀態。問，中央方面對北方各省市希望如何，答，爲完成大東亞戰爭，北方各省市所負兵站基地之使命，實至重且大，因此中央之期待，於北方各省市者至殷，一部人士以爲中國有南北中三部，實爲極大錯誤，吾人絕不能謂北方各省市有何特別情形，就中國歷史言，更不妄謂有特別情形。總之，參戰後之中國，全國上下業已團結一致，決心集中力量，努力完成戰爭。</p>
<p>北京十八日中央社電　國府訪日特派大使陳公博氏，前於完成訪日使命後，返國抵此，曾於十九日上午分訪日鹽澤公使，及日華北派遣軍岡村最高指揮官，對日本朝野之厚誼，表示謝意，並披瀝完成戰爭之決意。十六日又與華北政委會敎育實業兩總署督辦蘇體仁王蔭泰及新民會喻副會長等有所懇談，十七日並與財政總署督辦注時璟治安兼內務總署督辦齊燮兀等分別交換意見，繼又接見記者團。各事完畢後，卽於今日上午十一時搭機飛返南京。</p>
<h3>德政府任命韋爾曼　爲駐華新任大使　我國朝野深表歡迎</h3>
<p>南京十八日中央社電　德政府於去歲年末曾調駐華大使史塔瑪氏轉任駐日大使，至駐華大使遺缺，十七日已正式發表由德外部决官階級之政務局長韋爾曼繼任。韋氏外交手腕，極爲靈活，爲德外部有數人才，此次被任爲駐華大使，實足證明德政府之重視國民政府及中日關係，蓋德國自史塔瑪氏轉任駐日大使後，曾暫以哥德氏爲駐華代理大使，但自中國參戰後，中國國內各方面之情勢，已有急激轉變，大使一席，實不容久懸。同時國府方面亦極希望德政府早日派遣新大使，故此次決定由韋爾　出任駐華大使，俾於到任以後，與駐日大使史塔瑪氏相呼應，增强軸心關係。由大東亞戰時情勢而觀，德國對中日兩國外交陣容之整備擴充，其意義實頗重大，故國府方面，對此次德政府之任命韋爾曼氏爲新駐華大使，深表歡迎、</p>
<p>南京十八日中央社電　自德國駐華大使史達瑪被　任爲駐日大使，懸缺迄已三月，其繼任人選，深爲我國朝野人士所關注。現德國外交部已正式發表副國務員兼外交部政治司長韋爾曼博十爲駐華大使，我國朝野對韋氏出任我國，甚表歡迎，今後中德邦交，當可更見敦陸，是可預卜。</p>
<p>南京十八日中央社電　德政府此次任命韋爾曼博士，爲駐我國新任大使，事先並已微得我國政府同意，韋爾曼博士服務外交界多年，此次駐節我國，使中德兩國邦交，愈趨親密，誠堪慶賀，聞新任大使即可來華履新。茲探誌新任大使略歷於後，韋爾曼大使現年六十一歲，本爲漢堡船業界名宿、曾參加德派赴巴黎和平代表團工作，一九三六年至一九三八年，任駐英公使，旋回任德外部，氏爲英國問題專家，在外交界已有多年歷史，最近曾任德外部政治司長而轉任現職。</p>

<h3>旅津日僑森田氏　研究酒精行駛汽車成功</h3>
<p>天津十八日中央社電　此閣靑島街日僑森田幸决郎氏，前曾研究以酒精代汽油，在汽車之內燃機關上，作特殊之氣化裝置，最近業已成功。此特殊氣化裝置，即可使用酒精及高粱酒，其行駛能力酒精一公斤可行七又十分之一公里，汽油爲八公里，所使用之酒精，以有百分之七十以上之强度者爲最適宜。此項特殊氣化裝置機又有種種利益：如（一）僅用酒精即可開行汽車。（一）以汽油及植物油混用亦可行駛。（一）因裝有特殊電機，故初動亦極迅速。森田氏又爲使各界明瞭起見，特於十七日由此間日本商工會議所主持舉行公開試騐，結果頗博好評。</p>
<h3>二屆東亞醫學會　昨日圓滿閉幕　褚外長演講太極操效能</h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　東亞醫學會第二屆大會，二日來經數十人之特別講演與普通演講，收獲成果　偉，今已圓滿閉幕。茲誌今日（十八日）之經過情形如次：上午八時開會，首登壇者爲中國外交部長褚民誼氏，持各種器具，偕同助手隨講隨演的一小時。氏所講者爲氏十三年來提倡研究之「太極操」。此操乃中國最深奧之國術，歷代研究者頗不乏人，而褚氏尤有心得，故褚氏之講演極爲聽衆注意。下午開會，褚氏任中席。次爲滿洲醫大敎授緒方維弘氏之特別講演，題爲「滿洲氣候尤以寒冷時所及於身體體溫調節之影響」，發表其學術上之研究，對於醫學之貢獻頗大。普通講演則有東大醫學部敎授內林祜之博士，題爲「東亞醫學重要問題之鴉片麻藥中毒」，就北京「戒烟療養所」之實騐報吿舉行購演，且力言鴉片問題實爲東亞之重要問題，同時亦爲柬亞醫學者之當前急務。繼之滿洲國民生部衛生技監大平得三，就滿洲之鴉片問題予以澈底說明，並喚起醫學者對於中滿鴉片問題之注意。繼之中國會晨泰義醫學者等相繼發表個人之研究所得後，圓滿閉幕。下午五時全體赴下野精養軒出席東亞醫學會會長林春雄博士之晚宴，並預定十九日赴臨時陸軍第一醫院參觀。</p>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　十八日爲第二屆東亞醫學會第二日。國府外交部長褚民誼博士携帶壓力計·揚力計·押力計等十二種，首先說明太極操之效能，略謂「健康之積極保持與增進在鍛鍊身心。然鍛鍊身心之方法不可過難，以無論何人均可隨時練習爲貴。」至此褚博士舉桌上之器具，說明各種測定體力方法後，解說太極操，謂太極操脫胎於宋時中國武術界武當派之抽權掌。余復應用近代醫學原理加以改良與補充，其與歐美之運動與鍛練方法迪乎不同。兩者初視頗類似，但在其動作之原理則顯有不同。至此褚博士呼出助手一人，先令表演太極操，復以鷄蛋石子向空拋去，說明其柔軟運動之原理。嗣復以助手爲出手，實地表演說明太極操之動作，的分手腰脚三段，細分則有十個動作。復開映太極操之電影，介紹其實態的歷時十分鐘。最後褚博士又說明太極操之特長，在不費時·不費力·不費錢。各國出席代表傾聆之餘，咸認此爲純中國式之運動，無不一致稱贊云。</p>

<h3>軸心軍憑藉有利地勢　突境北部展開反攻　集中兵力企圖奪回傑貝爾安格　地雷機關槍密怖要塞堅不可拔</h3>
<p>里斯本十八日中央社電　傳突尼西亞戰綫軸心軍，在南起恩斐達　爾附近，北至塞拉多，西迄布阿拉達之反軸心新月形包圍陣中，已憑藉有利之地勢，將反軸心之攻勢擊退，並乘機反攻。刻在各地與反軸心軍展開激戰中。惟據阿爾及爾來電談，反軸心軍司令官埃森霍華於十七日招待記者團時，曾說明突尼西亞之戰局，指出戰局前途未許樂觀。略謂「反軸心軍欲將軸心軍驅出北非，尙需經過此次大戰，而今後反軸心軍作戰唯一之困難，厥爲德軍之質的優秀性。又軸心軍所敷設之地雷，亦爲反軸心軍作戰困難之一」云。另據華盛頓來電稱，美戰時情報局長可維斯於報告戰况時，曾嘗及突尼西亞戰局，略謂「突尼西亞戰局已入最後階段。羅美爾軍雖撤至北方，但其根據地已成爲堅固之要塞，長約百哩寬約三十哩云。又據北非消息，十六日北部地區曾發生激戰，茲誌各地戰况如下：（一）反軸心軍近與軸心軍激戰後，佔領捷貝爾安加。惟該方面之軸心軍似力圖反攻。據合衆社特派員電稱，據英偵察機飛行員報吿稱，安尼姆將軍已集結軸心軍部隊，準備奪回傑貝爾安格。（二）布阿拉達東南地之法叛軍，自十四日起至十五日止曾遭受軸心軍莫大打擊後，又受重創，故不得不暫時停止進攻。十六日該方面戰况無可報吿者。（三）南部地區英偵察隊及突擊隊曾在恩斐達維爾附近，與軸心軍少數部隊發生局部小衝突云。</p>
<p>里斯本十八日中央社電　突尼西亞戰綫並無變動。美軍及法叛軍所發消息，昨晚亦承認在東北橋頭堡之軸心軍正繼續作堅決之抵抗，並在數處反攻，又以地雷及其他方法阻碍反軸心軍之行動。美國合衆社消息謂，現時北方戰綫之戰鬥，乃全部非洲戰事中之最猛烈者。安特森將軍所部英第一軍及其輔助部隊向傑貝爾安格以外前進時，遭遇勇猛之抵抗。以前曾傳傑貝爾安格已入於反軸心軍之手，據英偵察機貧謂曾見安尼姆將軍將軍隊集中，測度此項軍隊係備奪回傑貝爾安格之用者。在恩斐達維爾之北對軸心交通綫作戰之反軸心偵察隊，曾發見有許多埋地雷地區及機關槍陣地，因此反軸心方面預期在有充份之重砲隊移至前綫之前，不致開始攻擊。此舉大概需時數日，蓋地勢崎嶇，並無道路，將必需之大砲移人陣地，亦非易事。</p>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　據海通社軍事特派員稱，星期五突尼西北境內曾有局部性質之猛烈戰鬥，尤以西部戰綫之北段爲甚。安特森將軍曾以最大之恒心，屢次冀圖奪取貝迦東北及梅傑茲埃爾巴勃北面及西北面之俯瞰高地。在貝迦地區攻擊之英軍及法軍，與反攻之德軍發生激戰。雙方雖僅使用一部份之部隊，但戰鬥極爲激烈。有數處山峯，於一日之內數次易主，因此現時尙難獲知該處局勢之正確狀况。但可得而知者，爲反軸心方面所傳反軸心軍已術擊梅傑茲埃爾巴勃以北之德軍陣綫全部一說，並不與事實相符。即使英軍果已在某數處地點突破軸心陣地，亦已遭德軍之反攻，將其擊退至原來地點。反軸心軍旣有大量之後備兵可用。則此處地區之戰鬥，不僅將繼續不輟，且將更爲猛烈。反之，布阿拉達東南地區於星期五較爲沉寂。季勞所屬法叛軍大部份係在此地區作戰，於星期三及星期四受軸心軍之嚴重打擊後，現時顯然尙未恢復。在南部戰綫曾有多次小規模接戰。英軍之偵察隊及突擊隊，曾冀圖突破軸心軍在其恩斐達維爾陣地四週所佈之屏環而未竟。有時雙方並以長距離大砲互轟。蒙特高茂萊之英第八軍何時開始其大規模之攻擊，現時尙難預言。</p>
<h3>德國「大西洋圍牆」大功告成準備活動　英美闢第二戰綫無望</h3>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　德國通訊社特別訪員稱，德元首希特勒發令建築「大西洋圍牆」未及一年而大功已經吿成。我人試立足於第」次世界大戰，美軍初次涉尼法國疆土之地點，已可俯視此千古偉大之防禦工程。舉凡高射砲大砲機槍安放處·抵禦坦克車防禦工程·與軍火貯藏所等，均歷歷在目。其水泥圍牆厚及三尺餘。沿海一帶均有堅固之防禦點，在河口港口及潛艇根據地尤夥。此項工程大部由外籍工人建築。在此圍牆之後，德軍師　守望頗嚴，敵人企圖登岸者立遭轟擊。憶英軍曾於去夏在第厄普遭嚴蠶打擊，其時彼處祇有臨時之防綫。現在完成之「大西洋國籍」，其堅固性當數倍於前云。</p>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　據海通肚軍事評論員史蒂爾菲列特將軍稱，自四月十日至十六日之一　間，突尼西亞境內曾有相當戰鬥。羅美爾元師所部爲再求縮短戰綫，業已撤離開魯安及蘇薩。在此兩處之北，新戰鬥巳開始。反軸心軍並自西而增加壓力，但各次攻擊皆被擊退。德空空軍亦有效的協助陸地部隊作戰，向敵力之供應根據地及後方交通綫集中攻擊。此處之戰鬥大致將仍繼續。在東綫方面，在該星期之內僅有局部重要戰鬥。蘇軍視庫彭橋頭堡如眼中釘，故屢次地云。該　評論員又稱，最近所宣布之「大西洋城牆」不應忽視。該牆自庇里尼斯直達德國邊境，長凡二千七百餘公里。其構造之原則，與長僅八百五十公里之著名之西方城牆大不相同。一九三九年英法兩國對該城牆極爲敬　，故不敢冒昧。與荷蘭所應允之援助潛艇根據地及海軍要塞之向內地方面亦有極有力量之堡壘環繞，以防傘兵自後方來攻，並可防敵人之或將冀圖登陸。故在　港之四週及河口等　處，設有最堅强之防禦工事。但單賴　禦工事，斷不能保障一國之免於被侵，故仍須賴人力以守之；如馬奇諾戰綫·梅特克斯戰綫即其前例。大西洋城牆係由精銳部隊防守，故成牢不可破。此項　隊並不如馬奇諾戰綫法軍之　於　　之後。如敵人冀　登陸，則此項軍隊將自四面攻擊之，如在第厄普之役。然此項可伸縮之防綫，並有公路可供穗軍將摩托化後備趕調至危急之地點。敵軍之希圖在西歐設立第二戰綫殊無希望云。</p>
<h3>英機夜襲　德工業區　損機達百架以上</h3>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　據德軍當局宣稱：英空軍部隊十六夜復大舉　炸德工業地帶，然遭重創而返。專家對此相當大規模之空襲，曾批評謂英國今又於夜間大舉來襲，須知夜間於德强力之防空陣前而凖確轟炸特殊之目標幾不可能。此次英機之轟炸，實無異於　廣地域撒放大量炸彈而已。故工廠附近之市民雖受有損害，而工廠則未蒙若何損害。英國雖對轟炸効果作擴大宣傳，然吾人對英國此次轟炸，實不明其目的何在。英機此次乃自十六日至十七日下午連續轟炸，如此達廿四小時之大舉空襲，英襲擊隊竟蒙受各次重大損害，實前所未有。是役確擊落英機百架以上，且大都爲四發動機之巨型轟炸機。檢查敵機之殘骸，以每架十屍體計算，航空員之損失當在千人以上。此光榮之大戰果，尤不能不感念高射砲隊及夜間戰鬥機隊之勇士云。</p>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　此間今日官稱，昨日美機襲不來梅時，被德方擊落四引擎轟炸機二十架，德方祇損失戰鬥機二架。在斯役中，什宅區　被擊中，人民傷亡頗多。同時英空等昨在西部地區與海面上，損失飛機七架。</p>
<h3>勃萊頓尼附近　德英艦激戰</h3>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，四月十六日凌晨英驅逐艦一艘，由摩托魚雷艇兩艘衛護，曾興德方海岸　艦隊在勃萊頓尼北部海岸附近發生激戰。敵方軍火方面雖屬優越，但因德艦應付得當，卒將敵摩托魚雷艇一艘擊毀，大的已告　失。敵艦第二次進攻時，德艦之一頗受損失。英驅逐艦長認爲此爲捕獲德艦之良機，乃逐漸駛近，意圖派水兵攀登德艦。德艦員兵俟其迫近，紛紛以手溜彈爲武器從事抵　。最後有巳毀之機槍一架忽被德水兵修理完竣，愈向預備登艦之英水兵開火轟擊。英方不防，死傷甚衆。該臘隨即倉皇退走，德方各艦皆安然返防。</p>
<h3>東綫泥濘時期將過　德軍完成大戰準備　庫彭區蘇軍攻勢被擊退</h3>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　據海通社軍事特派員稱，東綫南段巳入眞正之夏季氣候，寒暑表巳達攝氏二十度以上，在中段及北段溫度亦巳升至十度，故泥濘時期至四月底應可終結，而現時戰鬥這沉寂亦或將終止。惟局勢之發展，並不完全依賴氣候，雙方軍隊之決定　佔最大之成份。德軍防綫業已準備應付任何事變，所有參加冬季戰鬥之德軍隊伍業已獲得休養，生力軍源源自國內開抵前綫，軍火供應及燃料亦已準備充足。吾人應注意德軍自冬季戰役結束後，即占功守皆宜之陣地。故春季泥濘時期終結後，德軍即可完全自由活動云。</p>
<p>瑞典京城十八日中央社電　德官方新聞社昨晚宣稱，德軍於星期左又作猛烈之防禦戰鬥，將向庫彭橋頭堡及唐納資河上游攻擊之蘇軍擊退。蘇軍係用多數坦克車協助向庫彭橋頭堡之東南部作集合攻擊，但未能在任何一處獲得立足點。據稱蘇軍會喪失坦克車廿八輛，並有步兵三聯隊被完全消滅。唐納資河上游之蘇軍經長時問之沉寂後，又有在兩處地點攻擊，但德軍已有凖備將其擊退。在另一處地點有力之德軍會將蘇軍一隊隔離包圍。路透社莫斯科特派員稱，庫彭地區之少數主要公路已漸乾燥，雙方皆準備最後之大戰，以奪取該橋頭堡。</p>
<h3>德外交人員　大批更動</h3>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　昨晚此間公布：德外都助理次長原任外部政治可長韋爾曼博士，巳正式被任爲駐華大使。據德元首行營公報宣稱，德前駐華大使史泰瑪，已於數月前調任駐日大使，今以韋爾曼繼任；並任命前駐美大使迪克霍夫爲駐西班牙大使；外交部次長魏才克爲駐敎廷大使。此外該公報又發表德外部之重要人事更動數起，計有一等公使毛朗特被任爲外次，以繼魏才克；德國駐西班牙大使館參事漢克被仟爲外次兼外部政治司長以繼韋爾曼；著名外交家高斯博士·林特倫·及希威爾三人，均升任爲記名大使。</p>
<h3>中美德僑返國抵葡</h3>
<p>里斯本十八日中央社電　由危地瑪拉哥斯達黎加·及宏都拉斯各中美國家遣送返國之德僑　〇四人，內以婦孺佔大半，已於昨日乘西班牙輪船「柯米拉斯」號　此。將於下星期三賡續啟椗返國。</p>
<h3>緬甸日軍收獲戰果　英軍一旅團殲滅　—被俘上尉談經過—</h3>
<p>孟加拉灣十八日中央社電　日軍部隊曾於本月六日在英軍要衝，擊潰英軍第二師團第六旅團。當時扼守馬西半島南郁頓貝庫附近之英印混合軍第四十七旅團，不堪日軍一擊，即告崩潰向北潰舉。但退路已早被日軍切斷，故幾在印典被預伏日軍完全殲滅。是役英軍旅團司令部部附印軍上尉辛格被俘。據渠談稱，英印軍之侵入阿拉坎地區，仍爲圖重開滇緬路綫而開始行動者。今滇緬路綫之重開已吿絕望，尤其印典附近之鬥，可謂已在日軍之大勝利中完畢。當初余處身賴貝庫後方，未幾日軍由馬酉山脈中部攻至賴貝庫背後，此實出人意外。余初次與日本軍接觸。印象最深者，即悉日軍爲勇猛善戰之戰士。或問余印人旣渴望獨立早日實現，但又爲伺如此間接支援英國之支配印度而爲英人作戰。余可答曰，英人如欲阻止大英帝國之崩潰，故不問軍隊素質與人種，努力利誘印人入伍作戰。日本雖再三對印度發表聲明，但英國則始終竭九妨害日本聲明主旨之深人印度。至日本政府許可緬甸於年內獨立之聲明，余亦至今始知。余深信緬甸之獨立　影響於吾印人意理者定必至深且巨云。</p>
<h3>日大東亞相　青木訪越　越南人士表歡迎</h3>
<p>西貢十八日中央社電　日靑木大東亞大臣此次視察南方，意義殊大。越南上下聞靑木氏不日將抵越訪問，與越南首腦舉行懇談消息後，均極興奮。蓋大東亞戰爭發生前，越南即已深識日本在東亞之地位。前於民國二十九年六月即曾首先承認日本派遣監視團赴越，協力遮斷援渝路綫。翌年十二月大東亞戰爭爆發後，日越關係愈形緊密。當馬來及緬句作戰時，越南且進一步表示積極協力大東亞戰爭，並與日本歸結各種協定。日越關係之進展，可謂極迅速而順利。故靑木大東亞大臣此次赴南方視察，頗欲早日訪問越南，以期早諸協力大東亞戰爭之越南實情，並與越南當局舉行懇談。現越甫官民對靑木氏此行均頗表歡迎云。</p>
<h3>緬甸遴選民衆代表　分批赴日考察</h3>
<p>仰光十七日中央社電　自緬甸巴莫長官赴日訪問後，已引起全緬民衆赴日熱望。此間男女靑年尤均深以能至日本一遊爲快。軍政監部爲適應緬人之此種日本熱，決遴選緬甸政治產業敎育等各界代表五十人，派往日本參觀考察。現已着手銓衡人選。第一批十八人定下月出發，第二三兩批各十六人，亦預定於五六兩月繼之啓程。預定各在日本逗留三月云。</p>
<h3>哥倫布　航行史料　在塞維爾見</h3>
<p>西班牙京城十八日中央社電　塞維　某公證局之檔卷中，曾　見關於哥倫布自次航行至美洲之史料內容頗饒興趣，紀述雇船，船員，及工資等情形甚詳。</p>
<h3>美龐大造船計劃　英國深感關切</h3>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　據德國通訊社海軍評論家謂，英國航業界對美國新定造船註劃深感關切。該計劃包括建造千種碼頭，需要達五萬萬六千萬美元之巨。英國造船工程協會長哈利生最近在財政報上著文，謂「英國失却全球造船盟主地位之危險，已由幻想而成爲事實：並謂美國九萬萬六千萬元之龐大造船計劃，殊足引人注意。美海部船塢局畏毛里爾上將巳迭有聲明，海長　諾克斯在四月二日新聞記者席上亦曾提及美國計劃建築之船塢。在英國航空界之意，以爲係修理美國商船之活動船塢，惟須隨同將來之海洋艦隊，以便遇戰艦損壞時隨時修理。然此項計劃必吿失敗。蓋此種活　船塢茍須緊隨戰艦而行，則其龐大之體積　敵空軍之規模宏大，在在足爲敵方炸彈之最好目標。一俟此項活動船塢建造完成後，在缺乏修理船只碼頭之處如南美或南非海岸，果可運用順利，而英國海軍專家從此將感受苦味）云。</p>
<h3>美參戰以來　陸海軍傷亡數</h3>
<p>里斯本十八日中央社電　據華盛頓電，美陸軍當局十六日發表美參戰以來陸軍將士喪失數如次：美陸軍自參戰迄今，於世界各戰綫犧牲將士達七萬六千四百五十二名。其中戰死者一萬一千餘名，負傷者萬三千餘名云。</p>
<p>里斯本十八日中央社電　華盛頓電訊云，據美海部迄今所發于之傷亡表格，自珍珠港被襲擊以來，美海軍陸戰隊，及海岸衛隊之傷亡總數，共社官兵二四·八一九人·此外美海軍又續怖上週之傷亡，共爲一〇五人，計死者十九，傷者與失縱者八十一。</p>
<h3>英第八軍司令　抵阿爾及爾</h3>
<p>瑪德里十八日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，據摩洛哥無綫電消息，突尼西亞英第八軍司令蒙特甘茂萊將軍已乘飛機到達阿爾及爾。聞蒙氏曾與季勞及美第五軍司令巴頓將軍會商。</p>
<h3>特戈爾要求遭季勞拒絕</h3>
<p>坦支爾十八日中央社電　據可靠消息，季勞交由賈德魯致送與倫敦之說帖，其內容爲拒絕特戈爾之要求在法屬北非成立臨時政府及戰後在法國恢復議會制度。關於此兩點，季勞宜稱：臨時政府之事非余所願過問。余之使　爲在法國祖國境外代表法國之主權及利益，並創設一由願意作戰而能作戰之男子組織之軍隊。關於議會制度，則余不欲再見此陷吾人於一九國〇年之災害之制度得吿恢復云。據悉，該說帖之全文，將於星期一在阿雨及爾倫敦及華盛頓同時發表。</p>
<h3>義法西斯黨　秘書長易人</h3>
<p>羅馬十八日中央社電　義首相　索里尼於十七日召開法西斯黨首腦部會議，議決該黨秘書長維茲蘇尼辭職照准，遺缺由現任該黨副秘書長斯柯爾亞氏遞補。按維茲蘇尼前當西班牙內亂時，曾投効義勇軍參加革命軍方面作戰，當時曾經受傷。現因健康關係不勝劇勞，故呈請辭職。此　將專心致力於援護出征軍人家族事業云。</p>
<h3>德匈首領會談　得申駢肩作戰決心　匈攝政任務完畢返國</h3>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　據官塲官稱，匈牙利攝政霍才第上將與希勒會商二日後，巳於今日遄返布達佩斯。彼等曾就一般政避及與共敵交戰問題，作廣泛的討論，德外長里賓特洛甫亦列席。德軍參謀長　台爾元帥暨匈總參謀長茶曰期萊中校亦曾舉行軍事討論。會議中充滿德匈兩　友誼的傳統精神。雙方首領重申與蘇聯英美作載到最到勝利爲止之重大　心。</p>
<h3>印緬戰役特輯　反攻緬甸失敗　英美渝苦悶益深</h3>
<p>自日本方面發表在印緬國境對反攻的英軍二師加以俘獲和殲滅的大戰里後，英美各報對之，尙還保守着緘默；可是由那以反攻緬甸爲大舉空襲日本本土的前提條件之見地而言，則此役給與抱着超乎英國以上的期待之美國，以極可注目的衝動，實在是不容掩蔽的事實。英美渝到底是怎樣地熱中於緬甸的奪回？而因着日軍的猛烈反擊把其企圖粉碎後，他們的苦悶怎樣地趨於深刻化？現在試把各方面的情報，作綜合的介紹於下：</p>
<p>空襲日本和滇緬公路的關係</p>
<p>美國現在所最注力計畫着的事，乃是於利用太平洋各根據地和航空母艦以行奇襲的空襲以外，更欲從中國本土進行對日的連續大空襲。因此，美國乃對於所謂中印肌空綫和北方航空綫，正在作着最大限度的利用。這爾條航空綫中，尤以對於中印航空綫，注力最多，現在無間畫夜地在增修與築印度中　根據地。不過美國所眞正企圖着的對日空襲作戰，並不是奇襲的，間歇的，而是要用着二百架以至三百架的飛機，爲連續的强襲。上次視察重慶的美空軍司令阿諾爾德，對於宋美齡的要求急援，也舉着機體的不足，空運的危險性，以及汽油的不足三點，肯定着大規模準備的非易。又二月二十八日的先驅講壇報（Herald　Tribune）華盛頓電，也有着如下的報道：</p>
<p>「華盛頓官方認爲如不能充分輸送汽油，則運往軍慶方面所要求的軍用機五百架，是沒有意思的。一方面因爲軍慶統治下的經濟狀態極度苦窘，美國不但要從事軍事的援助，並且還要輸送日常必需品，以彌縫重慶財政的破綻。這個事實，使汽油的輸送，加倍發生困難。」</p>
<p>美國欲打開這樣的狀况，以便進行其所謂要把日本化成平地，則無論如何，非確保堅實的內　公路不可。然而現在所有的中印通路，不過是橫貫亞洲中部的幾條羊陽隊商路，所以奪回滇緬公路，實爲當前唯一的要圖。</p>
<p>和大舉空襲日本本土相關的滇緬公路之奪回論，最近在美國輿論中，有着急激的　映。紐約時報的社論說：「大　空襲日本本土前提，在大部分軍事專家的腦海裏，無不着想於先行奪回緬甸以再行開通滇緬公路。」先　講壇報說：「美國戰略家正在埋首於地圖，以考慮增强在華空軍的方法。其具體的計畫，雖因屬於軍事機密，不能置喙，但其必以再行開通滇緬公路爲先決問題，是不言而喩的。」又GF挨和俄特少校，也有着這樣的議論：「在華美國空軍能否整備完癢，全視乎中印空運組織能否充實或滇緬公路能否奪回。如把這兩個方法的利害得失一爲較量，自然是以後者，即滇緬公路的再開，爲事半而功倍的政策；而且滇緬路的奪回，決不是不可能的。」</p>
<p>大反攻是怎樣的</p>
<p>美國對於反攻緬甸，旣如上述，以之作爲大舉空襲日本本土作戰的前提條件，乃甚囂塵上地發生着作戰上的許多議論。先驅講壇報把軍械和借局中國部長弗蘭克林·雷的報吿中所稱：「運往印度的大量租借物資，爲了準備緬甸作戰之故，還繼續貯存於該地」的事實，加以誇張，而謂縱令現在馬上大舉反攻緬甸也未始不可。但是華盛頓軍事消息靈通方面，却這樣說：</p>
<p>「對緬甸的大反攻作戰，非到季節風終了的十月，恐怕不會着手吧。從六月半起，季節風開始吠襲緬甸，自海岸地方以迄緬甸的熱帶鬰林地方，完全成爲鼠疫和瘧疾的巢穴。因之，中部地方雖然比較乾燥，至少在雨季吿終之前，是不能展開大規模的反攻的。」</p>
<p>可是最根本的問題，還是在於那個成爲反　心的共通問題之兵員資材的運輸。現在在東部印度的的五十萬（從西部印度和南部印度，則一兵片甲也沒有派來）的兵力要實現像美國所翼望的大反攻，到底是不可能的，結果，便必須有待於從美國方面輸送大量的兵員和軍火。然而從紐約繞經好望角而到孟買，須行一萬一千五百海里，在這路程之中，隨處有着潛艇的威脅：同時，一千萬以至二千萬噸的船腹，是否能够騰得出來，也成爲問題。所以對緬甸的大舉反攻，也和歐洲第二戰綫同樣，徒然說說罷了。</p>
<p>那末，究竟如何而可呢？紐約時報二月二十八日的社論，對於這個質問，有着如下的解答：</p>
<p>「反軸心軍依着現實，非在兩大洋——西從摩洛哥，冰島，東至瓜達爾加那爾島，韋克島的戰綫——作戰不可。美國無論是奪回緬甸也好，强化在華美空軍也好，都不能如宋美齡所說那樣，能够輕易地舉措得來的，必須採用着所謂集中作戰主義的。」</p>
<p>又先驅講壇報華盛頓電，不服輸地述說着華盛頓消息靈通方面的見解：</p>
<p>「英美是遂行着以打倒希特勒爲第一主義之戰略的。所以要在東亞展開大作戰，至少必須有待於把軸心軍驅出突尼西亞以後。美政府目下對於東亞的戰略，一方面是在　極從事於緬甸反攻的準備；一方面是在從事充實在渝美空軍。緬甸的大反攻，非到秋天，是不會實現的吧！」</p>
<p>但對於如何反攻緬甸的具體計劃，却一句話也沒有道及。</p>
<p>美國的進退維谷</p>
<p>結果，美國依着所謂歐戰第一主義，必須等到收拾了歐洲以後，方始回戈於東亞戰綫——尤其是緬甸的大反攻。不消說，美國是以一九四三年爲「反攻之年」的，而且是以從中國往日本的大舉空襲爲基調的，因之，必須以奪回滇緬路爲先决條件。如上所述，其能力至少是不容其同時展開綿跨歐亞的兩大作戰的，於是，美國乃深刻地經騐着進退維谷的窘境了。因此，美國便不得不把利用中印航空錢的在華空軍之强化整備，爲最大限度的提高，在其可能的規模中，决定實行對日本本土的空襲；一方面儘可能促使英軍反攻緬甸。爲了這個企圖，英軍乃於本年二月以來，出擊於緬甸國境，可是在一個月間，巳爲日軍打得體無完膚。美國的這種「以他人之揮而角力」的常套手段在英印軍內部，已發生了不滿和警戒之聲。路透社喀喇蚩電，曾報吿着如下那樣相當强烈的主張：</p>
<p>「英印軍在戰局好轉以前，對於日本軍的威脅印度，只要採取消極防禦的立塲已可，鑒於印度國內的不安，和日軍之壓倒的優勢，現在要採取對日攻勢，並非其時，以五萬或十萬的兵力，實不能進行奪回緬甸的大作戰，我們不能爲美國本身的利益而流血」。</p>
<p>總之，在瓜達爾加那爾島經過半年死鬥以後，美國之欲由四南太平洋方面進擊日本本土的企圖，已遭阻遏，現在則正繼續其拚命的努力，以圖由北方安得列阿諾夫羣島，西方緬甸，進行其對日反攻，故其今後的　向，更有嚴防的必要吧。阿根廷京城古田特派員發—（丁：譯自四月十日讀賣報知）</p>
<h3>有延部隊建奇功</h3>
<p>（緬甸前綫小野，稻坦兩特派員發）敵人呼號着要奪回緬甸援蔣路，此次英軍首先向日方空軍根據地阿恰布殺到，日軍奮勇迎戰，展開大殲戰於伊拉瓦底河谷。此役，日軍迂回於敵後的有延部隊，奮戰功續殊偉，曾以其少數的決死兵力，衝破敲陣中心，其難以言喩的苦勞，和勇往直前的戰鬥精神，可說是此次大殲滅戰中怒放的鮮花。不飲小食凡七十日，馳進於無路之境，突破阿拉十峻嶮，造成了二千三百公里的挺身之行。</p>
<p>去年十二月下旬，覆面的有延部隊，即開始以其少數的兵力，密向曼達來北方推進。那時正是日軍爲要一舉擊滅敵軍的執拗反攻，於隱密之下，以謀集結兵力於阿恰布方面的時候。成爲日空軍根據地的阿恰布，右陸上爲阿拉干的峻嶮和伊拉底河的河谷所遮斷，要從後方補充給養，實有近於不可能的困難。</p>
<p>爲要打破這個困難，乃出動偵察，以探覓陸上的迂回路，這就是有延部隊的最初任務。當時敵軍已經循看日方防綫之隙，自緬印國境，向着蒙得，拉香格之綫，發動以英兵爲主體的大軍，帶着數十輛的戰車，和一百門以上的大砲，殺奔過來，企圖實行共反攻。因之阿拉干山脈的一帶，頓時有成爲敵軍的中心之觀。配屬於有延部隊長下的兵力，僅有〇〇〇名，可是他們竟以此少數的兵力，突入敵軍中心，向着阿恰布背後，進行着大迂回的偵察。部隊長及其部下，於出發之際，個個立了誓，必欲遂行其決死的任務。</p>
<p>遠遠地橫亘於緬印國境的阿拉干峻嶮，這時已是酷熱得像炎夏一樣，它的上半部，伸入於綿雲之中，映現着帶紫的山色。有延部隊　從正路默默地念入密林之中進行。不知在什麽時候，竟有很大的水蛭，鑽入兵士們的戎衣，或裏腿布裏面去了。在野營片刻的休息之間，兵士們低頭看見了流下的血，馬上解開裏腿布一看，便見有吸飽了血而身體紅紅地脹羗的水蛭五，六條，落到地上。密林裏特有的朽木和落葉，經過了長年月的腐爛，正在發散着一種獨特的臭氣，衝入鼻裏，使人抑不住要嘔吐。正以爲已進入了大密林之中的時候，忽然前面出現了高山，擋住去路，或者被阻於深及頸際的激流，往往躭誤行軍達幾個鐘頭。有時突然進至敵陣的正面，有時則迂回於敵陣的周圍，靠着戰鬥和奇謀之巧妙地配合運用，部隊乃得向西又復向西，一星期又從一星期，繼續前進，現在已經突人敵陣的中心了。可是道時和後方根據地的連絡，也就完全隔絕。不用說，糧食的補給是不會有的，而帶着的食品，僅僅過了十天，已經沒有了。於是就不得不掘食樹根，食草，喝泥漿水，然而却一心一意地前進。</p>
<p>一渡過喀拉坦河的上流後，阿拉干的羣山，便漸漸現出險惡的面貌，有時臨深谷，有時峻峯峭壁，戴雲矗立。糧食旣已吿罄，前途又是人跡未到的絕境，眞是生死關頭的困苦。所以一天之間，已經只能進行四公里至五公里了。然而他們一行八，却依舊不知其不可能，默默地繼續西進着。</p>
<p>這時，在〇〇根據地，終於認爲有延部隊不免全滅於敵陣中了，對於他們的生死，差不多視爲絕望。他們從根據地出發後，已經有了七十天，不飲不食，像螞蟻爬行般地繼續着決死之行，竟已突破了二千三百公里，峻嶮絕倫的阿拉千山，也漸被踏破了。到了二月二十一日的黎明，伊拉瓦度的河谷便突然呈現於眼前，不知不覺已經抵達自蒙得向阿恰布方面推進的敵陣背後了。於是有延部隊便個個勇躍起來了，更爲把這反攻的敵大軍從後方加以包圍起見，便又循着伊拉瓦底迪爾脫平地，一氣地向着阿保克瓦方面繼續推進。</p>
<p>恰巧這時自己方面的偵察機降落在地上，發見有延部隊後，大爲喫驚，因爲根據地的同伴，大家都以爲有延部隊必已全滅於敵陣中了，那知過了七十天，竟會大迂回到這出乎意料之處的伊拉瓦底河谷的敵陣背後。</p>
<p>自己方面的主力，原是預定於三月十日開始一齊攻擊的，現在這枝已被認爲全滅了的有延部隊，竟出乎意料地到達了敵陣背後，而且已經要從敵陣的背後開始攻擊，自然不能不顧到他們的，因此就把預定計劃提前實行。於是〇〇部隊便勇躍地從南方發動去呼應有延部隊，向着敵人英軍淮迫。於是有延部隊七十天的瀕死的苦勞，終於可以獲得報價了。三月八日，抵達喀拉坦河右岸的有延部隊，立即對於阿保克瓦方面的　軍一千二百名，實行背急襲，把他們不留一兵一率地殲滅爭盡。以着又去呼應從南方到來挾擊的〇〇部隊，於是，他們在伊拉瓦底河谷忍受過來的七十天的苦勞，便一發而展開了大殲減戰。丁（……譯自四月九日讀賣報知）</p>
<h3>緬甸殲滅戰記</h3>
<p>隨着戰局的進展，英美的援蔣輸血路香港路續，越南路綫，相繼切斷。最後，重慶所恃爲唯一生命綫之緬甸路綫，亦卒吿完全斷絕。抗日蔣政權變成「東亞的孤兒」，重慶的窮乏，與日俱深。香港，越南，已在日軍掌握之中，西北路綫的開發，進展也不能順利，所以他們現在爲了重開緬甸路綫，呼籲奪回緬甸，而反攻印糆國境，但終被日軍擊退，日軍屢次在航空部隊，地上進擊部隊互相呼應，密切合作之下，克履困難的地形，獲得光輝的戰果。在雨季之前，英印軍二師團在北部緬甸阿恰布方面大舉反攻，被日軍這用立體機動作戰，在馬西河畔一網打盡，而打斷了敵的出擊企圍。</p>
<p>羅斯福的重慶補給强化政策，先由於英國的印度派遣軍司令官華維爾，何應欽，羅卓英等的會見，而其作戰企圖遂見活發，自去冬十二月下旬前後起，英印軍一部沿海岸道路向阿恰布，頓貝庫，一部携戰車，大砲向拉基頓正面，準備南下。對此，日軍亦在拉基耶庫，頓貝庫方面，拉基頓正面，並阿恰布各地區配置部隊。對阿恰布的補給，僅賴海上運輸，而且孟加拉灣的敵艦，正在不斷的蠢動，馬酉河中，亦有敵砲艇來往，故情勢確很危險。然而日軍終於克服這些危險，至二月下旬，完成了預定計劃中的兵力的集結。</p>
<p>在此期間，敵方常來反攻，十二月下旬，正月初，曾有很盛的攻勢，都受了大打擊而敗退。一點也沒有成就。</p>
<p>有延部隊的作戰</p>
<p>呼應阿恰布方面兵力的集結，從背後奇襲敵人的有延部隊，越阿拉干山脈艱苦向目的地進發。</p>
<p>阿拉干山脈是高的三千公尺，人跡不到的險峻山嶺。該軍兵士在途中用火藥炸燬岩石，開拓道路，每日行程僅四。五公里，自出發以來的七十日，突破三百公里，終於三月二十一日進至平地。自出發越山脈，至加拉唐河，再達平地，糧食的補給完全斷絕，即用飛機偵察，也常找不到部隊的踪跡。</p>
<p>主力部隊的進擊</p>
<p>主力部隊預測有延部隊進擊的速度，而預定其轉取攻勢的日期在三月十日左右。因部隊的到達之早，出於意外，故變更預定計劃，於三月八日兩部隊會同從背後奇　阿蒲伽（加拉唐河右岸）之敵，殱滅捕虜敵人一千二百，更轉其餘而擊破康叔庫（阿蒲伽西南）之敵，而進出於馬西河畔。該部隊之一部隊，繼續北上，與南下增加之某地之敵相對峙，一面另一部隊並向薩拉庫達拉方面進擊，迄三月十九日爲止之戰鬥中，共殲滅馬西河左岸之敵二放團，再繼續北上，集結於泰米拉瓦附近，着手準備渡馬酉河。</p>
<p>當時馬酉河中有敵砲艇，舟艇的一百艘，阻止日軍渡河，該部隊勇士於二十四日深夜用民船乘敵不備全部渡河完畢，迄二十五日夕刻，進出於阿太特那拉，馬酉半島部隊的死鬥，在有延各部隊之光輝的戰果之後，以寡敵衆，支持苦戰，將敵誘向頓貝庫附近，並阻遏其攻勢，厥功極太。其最高度防禦能力的發揚，卽敵人亦爲駭異，部隊冒晝夜不意之敵軍空襲與重砲轟擊，在其死守的期間，主力部隊得向海岸印頓進擊。利用敵方的汽車路，使日軍運用機動戰略極爲有利。如此，在馬酉河畔，粉碎了敵的出擊企圖。</p>
<p>此次戰略的意義</p>
<p>本來阿恰布地方，從地理上看來，欲從南方攻擊，因有險峻的嶺與縱橫的河道，陸上運輸極爲困難。從仰光方面來，差不多是一座孤島，反之，從印度方面來，則因有汽車路，故進擊極爲便利，且在阿恰布飛機塲有航空兵力集結着，在其掩護之下，假使在緬旬海岸登陸，奪還緬甸，並不是不可能的。敵人根飾這判斷，故不斷的進行反攻。此次戰事，使敵的奪還阿恰布企圖，化爲夢幻。又此次作戰中在該方面出擊的敵軍，是英印軍最優秀師團第十四師團，再加上別一師團，都在日軍勇敢作戰及堅忍不拔的精神力之前，盡吿殲滅，在敵人的戰力上，是很大的打擊。（翔：自四月九日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<p>通盤籌劃棉花增產問題</p>
<p>本會工作，一方爲消費之管制，一方爲物資生產之增加，關於棉花增產等問題，有關於物價之調整者，至重且大，且農產品均有季節性，如不及時進行，誠恐時機一失，必待期諸一年之後，不僅影響生產，尤必牽及物價，　請大部通盤籌劃，早日准行。</p>
<h3>物資移動許可今起直接辦理</h3>
<p>全國商業統制總會成立伊始，對於物資移動許可事宜，特請兩實業部駐滬辦事處接管協助辦理。茲該會以事務部門業已組織完成，特於昨日派該會審核處移動組及總務處簽證組兩組主任，前往接辦。所有以前所辦之物資移動中請書件及許可證等各項文件，已山實部駐滬辦事處派員負責栘交竣事。今日起一切物資移動申請許可事宜，統由該商統總會負責繼續辦理。</p>
<h3>市區十期授糧　日內普遍開糶</h3>
<p>關於第十期市區計口授糧，業經市糧食局依據南市，閘北，滬西，浦東各區現有確實人口，分區配給竣事，飭令各該區公糶處即行繳款出米在案，此次授糧，仍爲每口不拘年齡，得授糧二升五合，售價共計爲七元五角，一俟各該區出米手續辦理完竣，即可普遍發售。南市區方面已於昨日起開糶。聞該區均係整米，並無搭配。至四月份米票，亦早經糧局散發，惟市民持票購米　須在米票背面注明保甲戶數外，復須由戶長加蓋印章，藉以防杜流弊，而使各廠授糧得以益臻週密。</p>
<h3>日總領矢野　發表談話　上海無空襲之憂</h3>
<p>駐滬日總領事矢野征記氏，昨日接見大陸新報記者時謂：我人觀於美國機帥，在一年前之今日，（四月十八日）企圖轟炸日本大陸，而結果一無所得，可知美方轟炸上海之企圖，必吿失敗。去年今日，余適在東京，目覩美機濫炸學校與醫院，且以機槍掃射正在逃避之大學生，殊屬慘無人道，試與以最低度射程祇轟炸軍事目標之日機師相較，則天理循環，美機空襲上海之告失敗也必矣。滬　市民必須愼防萬一，蓋美機襲擊東京時，日本市民，早已作相當之準備，然鑒於過去數次防空演習，滬上市民成續寄佳，對於美機空襲何懼之有。矢野末謂事雖如此，我上海市民應繼續硏究防空法術，因恐怖與混亂，較實際轟炸爲害尤烈。</p>
<h3>警局協助　徴收市區田賦</h3>
<p>事變後，市區田賦，全數停頓，嗣後國府還都，百政悉納正軌，庶政日新。市府以田賦收益，爲國家正常稅收，曾一再積極整頓，恢復征收，乃査少數市民，不明法令，企圖逃避，殊屬非是。市府爲切實整飭計，曾于區政談話會議席上，一致決議，此後各經征田賦，由市警察總局派警協助，以期增裕國庫，而息刁風。市警察總局，現已接奉府令，當即轉飭所屬各區分局等，一體協助，以重國庫。</p>
<h3>肉攤使用短評受罰</h3>
<p>工部局情報處公吿云：査新閘英塲第四十五號肉攤攤販孫興財，使用短秤，有違定章，經本局衛生處於本月九日査獲後，控請法院於次日判處罰金三百元，秤具沒收示儆。</p>
<h3>日駐華大使館改革機構　實具有重大意義　爲適應國府參戰後之新情勢　對於經濟方面力促其一元化</h3>
<p>日政府於去歲十一月，設立大東亞省後，即將外務省及興亞院等各在華機關，改屬大東亞省。而由日駐華大使指　監督，除以南京爲主外，並在北京·上海·張家口·等地分設大使館事務所，派特命全權公使，分別負責。綜合過去屬於外務省及興亞院之各機關，即總領事館，及領事館，以及頓事館警察署等，亦均歸其掌管，故至此統一機構，業已確立。</p>
<p>從前組織</p>
<p>至於大使館事務所之機構，除在公使下設官房外，並分設總務·司法·經濟·財政·文化·等五部。又爲適應當時之經濟情勢起見，在財務方面，並分別區分爲一般經濟事務，金融事務，以及財政事務等。關於辦理一般經濟事務之各課課長，由陸海軍現役軍人担任，俾直接負責處理，至於上海日大使館事務所之機構亦與上述者相同，然因國府之參戰及中日關係之進展，情擊業已大變，同時，各大使館事務所機構爲適應此新情勢起見，遂於本年四月一日重加改革。</p>
<p>新的機構</p>
<p>此項改革後之新機構，除在公使下設官房及審議室外，僅設總務司政及經濟三部，各部下並分設各課如總務課下設總務·情報·調査·報道·及文化等四課，司政部下設行政·警務·練成·三課，經濟部下設企划·商工·農林·交通·金融·財政·六課·蓋此次改組機構之主要目標，乃在求專務之簡捷，　發揮綜合機能。</p>
<p>改革概況</p>
<p>其主要者如（一）審議室，過去向屬總務部，由總務部長指揮，然改組以後，即昇爲直屬公使，並成爲輔助公使，審議或計劃各重要方策。換言之，即爲公使之輔佐機關。（二）取消大使館事務所內由現役海陸軍人直接担任事務之各課及各科，而將各現役軍人改派於審議室，計劃所，審議各重要方策，並担任與軍部方面之聯絡事務。（三）過去除審議室及官所外，復有總務·司法·經濟·財務·文化·等五部十五課，改組以後，爲總務·司法·經濟·等三部十三課，如此可避免事務之複雜，俾促進全機構之活動，使趨合理化。（四）總務部內分設情報調査。軍報道兩課，避免以往兩課事務之混淆，並縮小過去文化部之機構，改爲文化課，直屬於總務部內。（五）經濟部內新新增設企劃課，設計物資移動，交易運輸，資金勞務等十項計劃之樹立物價對策，華中振興公司業務及其他有關經濟財政之經濟政策。（六）取消過去對華中金融通貨政策方面極大貢獻之財務部，使其歸入經濟部內。因此，以往財務部內金融財政及監査三課，亦改爲余融及理財兩課，而併入經濟部內。又以往之監査部，亦包括在新理財課內。</p>
<p>改革意義</p>
<p>至此，可明悉大使館事務所改革機構之意義，蓋自中國參戰後，國府即積極整備國內參戰體制，並爲增强戰力，復興產業及安定民生起見，首謀將自由經濟完全改爲戰時計劃經濟，目下巳確立自重性之統制經濟機構，並動員全經濟界，積極推進。日本方面，於中國參戰時，即聲明交還租界，撤廢治外法權，並更進一步緩和取締長江下流各地物資移動規則，並將取締機關栘交國府自理。更爲協力國府以中　券完成統一華中及華南各地之通貨政策起見，遂又毅然廢止發行新軍票。由此而觀，即可見中日兩國關係，已更趨緊密，而同向完成大東亞戰爭之共同目的邁進。因此，日本方面各在華機關，爲適應此種　情勢，乃改革過去機構參就另一方面而觀，各大使館事務所之取消陸海軍現役軍人任課長之撤廢，大藏省駐華財務官以及經濟金融對策之趨於一元化等，皆奧國府政治力之强化及通貨政策之成功，實有緊密關係。由此足見此次日駐華大使館之改革機構，實具重大意義云。</p>
<h3>主席墨寶展覽　轟動全市</h3>
<p>在主席墨寳「故人故事」手稿，自前昨兩日陳列於大新公司四樓畫廳公開展覽，連日轟動全市。前往瀏覽者，每日不下萬人，其中以文化人及大中學生居多數，每駐足欣賞，從首至尾，不留隻字，對此佳箋手蹟，均贊賞不已。大新畫廳內肩庫踵接，熙熙攘攘，盛况空前，開未有之紀錄。惜展期有限，未能使全市人仕盡享眼福。</p>
<h3>公共租界防疫運動　衛生分處規定注射時間</h3>
<p>工部局布吿云：自本月二十日起，市民向就近向該局各區衛生分處或各區保甲當局所設注射防疫針地點，請求免費注射防疫針，並領取防疫證書，各區衛生分處之地址列後：</p>
<p>（星期六下午例假日及星期日除外）</p>
<h3>所得稅暫行條例　科罰追繳執行規則　公司行號應繳之所得稅　不得由會計師代爲申報</h3>
<p>財政部所得稅處上海區徵收局，依照所得稅暫行條例規定，對各業所得稅收，應於每年年終結算一次。現以卅一年度早經終了，故已開始徵收，並由部頒令各業經據實申報，應完納稅額，以裕國稅收。惟奉財部規定，各公司行號，應繳所得稅額，不得由會計師代爲申報，各區局亦不得接受。故該局對各公司　號之委託會計師代爲申報情事，絕對拒絕，以重稅政。</p>
<p>擬訂原因</p>
<p>查各類所得稅之申報，爲發現有虛偽隱匿暨納稅義務者，或扣繳所得稅者，不依期限繳納稅款，依照暫行條例主管徵收機關得移請法院罰辦。過去法院辦理違反所得稅暫行條例之案件，以向未定有規則，往往無所依據，未能實施科罰，於稅收殊多影響。司法行政部羅部長以所得稅　世界最優良之稅制，且適合於戰時財政體系，爰經擬具司法機關依修正所得稅暫行條例科　追繳執行規則草案，咨准財政部同意，提經行政院第一五三次會議通過。此後所得稅主管微收機關，對不依期限繳納稅款者，經栘請法院審理，法院即可根據是項新頒規則科罰。如仍逾期不繳，即由法院强制執行追繳其稅款及罰金。法院審理訴訟事件時，如發覺有違反所得稅暫行條例或其他有關所得稅法令之案件，亦得根據是項條例，移請所得稅主管徵收機關核定稅額後，再行分別科罰或迫繳。茲將司法機關依修正所得稅暫行條例科罰追繳執行規則，探誌如下：</p>
<p>條例全文</p>
<p>第一條：司法機關對於所得稅主管徵收機關　依修正所得稅暫行條例第十九條曁二十條，移謂審輝或於審理訴訟事件時，發覺之違反所得稅暫行條例案件應依本規則科罰追繳執行之。</p>

<h3>張一鵬氏昨講「市民福利」</h3>
<p>司法界耆宿張一鵬氏，昨應靜安寺學術星期講座之請，主講「市民福利」，各界往聽者二百餘人，由監院密迦法師致介紹詞，於鼓掌聲中張氏登台。其講詞大意略謂近年來滬休居，承各界敦促，襄助地方事業，爲市民謀福利，固我夙願，然而照現在滬市一般之觀察，則所謂福利者，僅爲一部分人之福利。是以現在上海之繁榮，自係畸形的，非合理的，更不合香人之理想。惟欲求人民發揮力量，爭取共同福利，則首賴地方自治機構之健全，不良風俗之滌除，庶幾人人無身家性命之顧慮，市民有保障，各得其所，各安其行，各樂其業。去秋同人感於責任之重大，集中地方人力，組織協會，研究地方興革，用建議方式，以興有關方面協謀改善，使人民生活，不受禍，不受害，合於市民福利原則。各界不妨隨時建議。滬市爲中國之一環，亦大東亞之一環，市民福利固極重要也。聞下星期請留學印度六年研究哲學之季奘法師講大乘成業論，歡迎大衆前往聽講。</p>

<h3>評言　日本維持物價政策的新決定</h3>
<p>物價問題成爲目前的嚴重問題，因此　決物價問題的方法，也就成爲目前的　　課題。誠然，加緊統制，改善配給、處罰抬價，澈査囤積等等，無一不是爲着解決物價問題而發，可是，說到物價問題，與其事後致力於高物價的抑平運動，　不如事前努力於低物價的維持辦法。環顧世界各國，戰時低物價政策維持最爲有效的國家，當推友邦日本。聽說日本經過這麽多年的戰爭，其物價的高漲程度，平均僅比前物價高漲一倍左右，這樣一個成績，恐怕是任何一個國家所不能超越的。</p>
<p>前日（四月十六日）日本內閣會議，復又決定維持低物價的基本原則，其雙重目的，在於一方面穩定人民生活，一方面增加戰時生產，而其主要辦法，在於以較高價格付諸工業產物，以低價施諸人民消費。依照此項辦法，政府購買工業產物時，生產者得獲標準價格之扣保，換言之，其所獲得的價格，足以維持原料方面的製造。同時，對於消費者所當付給的價格，則維持其現狀下的水平綫。</p>
<p>這樣一個維持低物價的基本原則，實在是値得我們取法的。因爲，物價的原則，在於安定，而安定物價的基本原則，在於促進生產。因爲生產增加以後，社會上的物資，自然不會演成求過於供的形勢。所以本欄於四月五日論「合理化的物價問題」中，曾經特別提出工廠成本會計一點，主張不使廠商過分吃虧，也就是鼓勵生產以資抑平物價的意思。</p>
<h3>銀錢業同業公會　嚴格監督會員業務　行莊不得爲商品之買賣　押軟限以同業公會會員</h3>

<h3>華中華北間決定　交換物資辦法</h3>
<p>華中華北兩區，向因儲備券對聯銀券之關係，在經濟上未能構成整個集團，而二者間之貿易亦未能達到理想之圓滑順利。最高當局認爲此種現象，有得戰時經濟體制之發展，今後將盡力設法打開現局，使兩地間之物資得能圓滑交流，因此華中將以小麥豆粕食糧物資，供給華北，惟華北雖以煤斤及其他物脅以爲補償。但尙有相當人超。至其決算方法，亦經商酌決定，根據物資流通之根本方針，今年對滙兌決算上之不平衡，將聽其存在，決算並用儲備券與無匯兌兩種方法，儲術券決算部份之重要物資，以不平衡數額之牛，作爲儲備銀行供給華北之放款，以爲決算方法之一。因此華中與華北間貿易之躍進，與夫物資對流之順利，自在意料中。</p>

<h3>參劃商統會人士的見解</h3>
<p>蠟燭</p>
<p>唯有中日商界團結起來組織下層機構，商統會的統制物資，才能完全發揮效用，合理統制物資的採辦，配給，是問題的中心，可是如何求其合理，還在於下層機構準備到那　程度。</p>
<p>奉派爲下層機構籌備主任的榮泰洋行經理堤又藏氏（蠟燭業）際此成立下層機構時，發表其抱負如下：</p>
<p>當局的方針，聽說第一步是商業統制，第二步是工業統制，所以這次的目標就在於如何成立採辦及配給的下層機構，在這種塲合，尤其是中日的聯繫爲最大問題，雙方聯繫的良好與吾，足以決定其成功得失。</p>
<p>要組織中日商界打成一片的配給機構，第一是要整理那些星散的華方配給機構。</p>
<p>第二，就是如何與日方配給組合聯繫起來，第三內地的統一配給機構和上海地區的配給機構怎樣結合起來，以上這些問題，都做到了完善的境地，那末物資自能暢通。</p>
<p>例如現在上海的蠟燭製造商界，日方計有日本油脂，出光，福壽，上海油脂，此外日本油脂（軍管理工廠）四大工廠，中國方面有二十八家，中日兩方的生產力合計起來是〇〇〇，可是中國方面的，多數是家庭工業式，一只機器祇有六十根的生產力，每一家多至五，六部機器，不特製造力不及日本方面，就是出產的品質也很粗劣，今後的問題就是中日雙方的出品如何來比率，用何種方式配給與各地。</p>
<p>按照過去的配給方法，華方出品是不加統制的，祗把日方出品分配與中日兩方。</p>
<p>聽說中國方面正循此方向着手籌設聯合會，同時日本方面也在從事此項問題，把它解決了，雙方才能眞正聯結起來，例如設一個中日的協議會，也是一種辦法，關於統制事宜，無論如何上海和內地必須一元化，對於此點，余擬與中國方面充分交換意見，總之要把中國的好處和日本好處併相維繫，運用其機構，實是當務之急。（四月十五日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>成敗小言</h3>
<p>— 胡力</p>
<p>關於成敗二字的理論以及事實，一般人自己也排演得很熟練，更何況自古以來的史實底累證呢，照例還是藏拙的爲上策，以免出醜。但是最近遭遇到一件成敗二可的事了，自己有些分辯不淸，請賢明者給我以答案；順便排洩我我不出出路的憂悒而巳。</p>
<p>事實從買皮鞋而起：一雙皮鞋要買，自然不是一般老實的薪水階級所能信手拈來的，我定了一個計劃決定按月從「調劑身心」和「减少脂肪」兩項下抽出六十元，則六個月以還，豈非如願了嗎？眞是「謀事在人」，循規蹈矩了二個月，居然積下一百二十元，心想先去拜訪一下陳列在櫥窗中相當闊氣的「足下」，想到再過一百天，我處於主人的地位了，心裏稍稍得意，身子也浮了起來，焉知走到一看，「足下」別來無恙，兩月的「寓公生活」身價却增高了，眞所謂「三日不見，刮目相看，」矧兩月哉；我倒抽冷氣，掉首而歸。所以我的月積六十元的策劃是成功，但買那一雙皮鞋却失敗，講到成敗二字是對立的，難道亦是什麽兩位一體，也許是僞君子的兩重人格不成嗎？倘是我抑而求其次，固不失仍爲皮鞋一雙，可是對得起自己二個月的茹辛嗎？</p>
<p>因此感慨來了。項羽戰不過劉邦，委之曰「非戰之罪也」，觀乎我之買皮鞋不成，却也同流，無分軒輊，不過項羽在史家的評論還譽之爲英雄的，不得其正而得偏，不管當時的項羽是否要得「英雄」二字而自刎烏江的，照普通的人想來，項羽也許明白了大勢已去不甘爲「敗者爲寇」而出醜，雖自戕却心有所不甘，可是身後還有人去撫慰，或可瞑目了。在我則旣不甘心得其偏，更談不到正，僅是一怒而絕裾，恐也有人謂我怕買其偏而成不足道之將軍而割席乎，那末我來自譽我另一個名字吧，惜乎無合式的，就是「典史」吧。倘要質問我到底含有什麽深意，老實話，我從那篇名「閻典史傳」的題名去其頭尾而成，典史是不如將軍的小官，粗心看來却是上典當的脚色。</p>
<p>正在爲皮鞋一事發怒，朋友來啓示我了：「現在什麽都日夜的漲價，當時的不買，就是造成今日的煩惱，我勸你還是今天忍痛去置了吧，說不定明天又要漲上去了。」心感之餘，可是成敗的關鍵又來了，假使我手頭有二百令白報紙或幾許奎寗或其他什麽的，即使皮鞋在二個月中我已成於那廂，敗在皮鞋上，尙能拉平。</p>
<p>雖然納悶，可不忘奮鬥，還是節流吧——像我們這般缺乏開源的本領的。因此到甘願以按月六十元的馬力去對抗兩月的。心似有餘而總嫌力不足，惟天地穹蒼，彷彿小了一些</p>
<p>那個朋友又來說：「幹麽你近來這樣瘦？」</p>
<p>我回答他說。「我在跑馬拉松呀！」</p>
<p>「你好端端的，怎麽跑馬拉松呢？眞是有些發瘋。」</p>
<p>「哈，發瘋。」</p>
<p>我再告訴他六十元和一百五十元的那件事。結果他說：「你在做夢。」說完，很不屑似地洋洋地去了。</p>
<p>發瘋而再加上做夢，自然不成功　且必救也無疑了？說是絕對恰也不大合理：身爲斯文者流，日夜掙扎於憂患中，豈小深吻合孟子之言曰「生於　患而死於安樂」乎，他旣接半句死於安樂，好像也包含些成功　意味，否則要變成消極的自殺者，或是頭上剃光身上袈裟的身依三寳的人了麽。聖人者，時也，他當然不指這　人物，那末我的憂患倒是有福了。如此一來投機操縱，囤積居奇的　色我倒希望他們能多活一年，蓋有待我之「成功」也。可是一般市民們（當然我也多少有份的）却口口聲聲的咒駡着恨不得寢其皮，食共肉，飮其血得之而甘心呢，還不知是否因肉價貴平日少了油永而他們生得胖若豬豕，抑或也像我因買不到皮鞋而寃他們奸險如蛇蝎呢！我能寫寫，但讀到了朱子語錄上一段：「文人雖未必能，却也口中說得，筆下寫得，足以動人聽聞，多致敗事。」蓋我在坐之待成，倘使七嘴八舌，塗來寫去，就是避免敗事也。唉，這世界。</p>
<p>我想到去寫他們的致富成功史，惜無力付諸印刷公諸世間，想想終究沉浮在憂息中的來得多些，與其爲少數人差遣，不如夾在大衆裏面來得安心。痛苦果然不免，骨節裏舒服之感却加濃了，似也不無小補。因此往常失眠的我，今晚也如阿Q之獲得精神勝利而得一夜的好睡。</p>
<p>豈不有所成乎，恰還値得一笑嗎。</p>
<h3>我底大掛兒</h3>
<p>— 惠人</p>
<p>靑烟裊裊地往空際漂浮去，一個圈兒，又是一個圈兒。</p>
<p>我唯一的大掛兒，漸漸靑灰，是衰老了。左角一個破綻，右角也有一個破綻；不久，洞兒爬滿了我底尊物，牠們找到了許多同伴，都樂意地安居下來了。我忙去請敎衣服底外科醫生去，請想法驅逐牠們。誰知，醫生搖搖頭：『太遲了！』她輕輕地拒絕了。我黯然回來，憤恨的立刻卸棄了牠。我底小褂兒露臉了，呀，更糟，更　洞兒們寄生的所在，見不得人！沒奈何，重又披了上去，靜等着新的大褂兒的代替。</p>
<p>我沉思着，計劃着，要積緊一些人間魔物—金錢。我顧不得朝夜，我顧不得病患，絞　腦汗，搖撼着筆稈，掉下較多的白紙上行行點點的黑墨；天依人願，竟捉住了較多的魔物，舊褂兒也滿心喜悅、快產生　代啦。我昂首邁步，跨進大褂兒底家鄉，要獵取心愛的一個。舊褂兒睜大了眼，竟發了呆，牠底同類，身價分明是抬高啦，抬高到雲霄，牠懊悔早出了門，我也拈量魔物，在墨跡未乾的標價上是找不着等價的，悵惆地同到柏油道上。我底大褂兒仍是一個圈兒，又是一個圈兒。（酬移　學金）</p>
<h3>玉谿詩論</h3>
<p>— 審寄</p>
<p>在玉谿集中，可以看出兩種逈異的情調，一種是屬於幽寂的心靈，一種是屬於坎坷流離中引起的捐忿，當然只有前者纔代表詩人魂夢的淸音，因爲一切激情繁響對瑩澈的詩情都是有礙的，不過這句話也不是適切於所有的詩人，譬如杜甫，若不是世勢的陵夷和艱苦，我不想他會超過一個忠誠的良民或是小小的官吏的，因爲杜甫沒有野心，只有忠誠，沒有直接感應自然的深隨，只有傾向於良善政治的懇摯，這樣的人，要處在較好的環境裏，最多不過表現出一個沈默怡然的微笑罷了。李商隱却不是這樣的，我們只要看他幾首詩，就可以看出來，他完全沒有那種鄕民式的誠樸和幽默，他是像一切「不盡善」的天才那樣，心裏充滿着慾求和一種莫明其妙的悲楚，我們可以說即讓他自己佈置個世界，他也不能够處之無憾的，他的存在，好像不是爲了生活而是爲了想象，他那溫柔的孩子般的情感，當然不能在冷酷的世界裏生育，於是他像一切沒有實踐能力的天才那樣，把他的整個心靈寄託在詩裏，他有一種透視紅塵的力量。在世界裏覓求美好的東西——這種東西世界上不是沒有的，只是曉得去探求的人太少了。再則這種探求必須先有一種自生的不可解的「心之鬱悶」，因爲眞正的美必須透過這種東西才會變成偉大，譬如這些最最美的詩句，那一句不是深染着「心之鬱悶」？</p>
<p>花明柳暗繞天愁，上盡重城更上樓，欲問孤鴻向何處，不知身世自悠悠。</p>

<p>不辭題　妒年芳，但惜流塵暗燭房，昨夜西池凉露滿，桂花吹斷月中香，（昨夜）</p>
<p>這不僅是美，還有一種女性的細緻，一種過分溫柔的情感帶着它那不可免的悔恨，這就是李商隱的第一種情調了。實在這種事實他自己也曾感到過。他說：</p>
<p>曉用雲添句，寒將雪命篇，良辰多自感，作者豈皆然……（偶寄）</p>
<p>他這樣深思的人會不了解自己嗎，他巳深　感悟到他已經是而永遠是個爲思想而煩惱的人，爲美麗而憔悴的人，可是所這無盡的煩惱中，他不是絕對沒有喜悅的，看了下面兩首詩，就可以看出，他一方面已到了極端疲倦的時刻，同時却也會歡喜；而這種歡喜簡直是溢出心靈的。</p>
<p>日日春光鬥日允，山城斜路杏花香，幾時心緒渾無事，及得遊絲百尺長。</p>
<p>密鎖　關掩綠苔，廊深閣迴此徘徊，先知風起月含暈，尙自露寒花未開，蝙拂　笙終展轉，鼠翻窓網少　情，背短獨共餘香正月崇讓宅）</p>
<p>喜悅了，他幾乎自言自語到微笑起來，不過除了這次以外，他很少再曾喜悅過，他不能永遠等待在這幽杳的宅院裏。他的野心領着他向世界上跑，而在世界上，他是永遠絕望的。</p>
<p>講到他的野心，以及由這種野產生的另一種情調，我只想簡單的說幾句，李商隱是個有大志的人，而這種志氣幾乎是誇張的，與他那溫柔的性格一點也不相稱。譬如在少年時期，他曾有過這樣的雄心，「永憶江湖悲白髮，欲迴天地入扁舟」，可是他的時代是謬亂的，他的命運也格外偃蹇，經過了多少年的掙扎和跌宕，他纔感嘆道「如何匡國分，不與夙心期」，這實在是可憐的，他覺得他的整個生命全在錯誤裏泯沒了。他始終是在大夢裏沒有得着生活，他說：「顧我有懷同大夢，期君不至更沈憂」，這是眞的，一個多思的人，擬定了一種眞正的生活而想達到他，簡直是小可能的，他將永不會得到成功，正像葉芝所說：「你生來是爲了比成功更難的事」</p>

<p>奏起了蔡可甫斯基的「悲愴交響曲。</p>
<h3>老鞋匠和他的妻子</h3>
<p>— 溫凡</p>
<p>我們樓下灶披間裏住着老鞋匠，那是一個五十多歲瘦小的老頭子，像蝦子一樣駝着背，很難抬起頭來。臉上滿是縐紋，像打着雜亂的結子。但皮色倒是紅的，那種混濁的像豬血似的顏色……</p>
<p>他沒有兒女，祇有一個跟他差不多年紀的妻子。他就輕蔑地叫牠老太婆。她比他高出半個多頭，但臉色蒼白，縐紋也一樣多，好像比丈夫還顯老。</p>
<p>老鞋匠在外面很和氣，不大會說話，但老是嘻嘻地笑；像有非常的快樂似的。那些娘姨和窮苦的主婦們也歡喜他，他的鞋子上得結實；而價錢又便宜，但在家裏，他的性子變得很暴躁，常常聽見他在咒駡他的妻子，有時還要打她，捺住她的頭，像敲釘子似的捶她的腦袋。</p>
<p>『死老太婆，我要打死你……我恨不得……』</p>
<p>他的妻子却像羊子一樣柔弱，祗默默地忍受着他的辱駡和毆打。從來不還手。頂多獨自嗚嗚地哭一回，抱怨似的咕嚕一聲：</p>
<p>『前世造的孽，……造孽…。』</p>
<p>有一天晚上，我在自來水龍頭洗鞋子，看見老鞋匠摸在桌上喝酒，他妻子吃好飯坐在他對面拆舊鞋子，祇偶然覷了他一眼，老鞋匠就橫了眼睛，憤怒地咒起來了：</p>
<p>『死老太婆，你覷我做什麽？……是不是咒我早點死——你說：死老太婆…』</p>
<p>他妻子寃屈地叫了起來：</p>
<p>『眞正是前世造的孽，我幾時咒過你的……我看看你吃完了酒沒有，飯要凉了。……眞正是造孼……』</p>
<p>老鞋匠的氣還沒有平，喝一口酒就惡狠狠地瞅她一眼；一直到喝完最後一口酒。忽然，他又暴怒地嚷起來了：</p>
<p>『你怎的，你要餓死我啦……連飯不裝給我了……好，你找死……』</p>
<p>他妻子吃驚着站起來盛飯，還低聲地解釋着說：</p>
<p>『我昏了……一個該死的結子……眞正是造孽…』</p>
<p>一直等關了燈，他們大概爬在床上睡了，還聽見老鞋匠混濁的，像囈語似的聲音：</p>
<p>『你怎不會死的，死老太婆呀！我一看見你就一肚皮氣……』</p>
<p>又是一天晚上，飯都吃過了，空氣很靜，突然，下面又是老鞋匠暴怒的聲音：</p>
<p>『畜牲：死老太婆……我，……我打……』</p>
<p>灶披間裏突然像天翻地覆似的亂着：那些桌子板櫈，又是什麽金屬的鐵釘，鑽子混亂地碰擊着，老鞋匠發瘋似的喘着氣，嚷着：</p>
<p>『死老太婆，你要謀殺我……我先殺了你！』</p>
<p>整個屋子和後弄堂都哄了起來，大家圍在他門口，祇見老鞋匠一手揪着他妻子的頭髮，一手揑着拳頭，狠命地朝她頭上亂捶，他妻子嗚嗚地哭着，虛幌着兩　手，她那過長的身子可怕地彎曲着，臉色鐵靑，嘴裏還流着血。</p>
<p>幾個人上去把他們拉開，老鞋匠看見我們就鬆了氣。他不好意思地笑笑，向我們伸出左手，大姆指上有一個傷痕，淌着血。</p>
<p>『你們先生看，……她拆的鞋子，後掌上還留着釘子，……她不是存心謀死我，……這個死老太婆，你們先生看她的心多毒……』</p>
<p>他妻子坐在地上嗚咽，用袖子管揩着嘴角上的血，辯解着說：</p>
<p>『眞正是造孼，你說我存心……我不過眼睛花了花，沒有看得仔細，……眞正是……』</p>
<p>老鞋匠又瞧了她一眼，却沒有發作半嚮，他又向我們不好意思地笑笑。</p>
<p>『嘻嘻……你們先生看，天下那裏覓得出這種老太婆……像什麽樣子呢？不過打幾下子就哭得這樣，嘻嘻，……我吿訴你們先生聽，從前我吃師父打爛了手姆指，我哼也不敢哼……』</p>
<p>等大家走開，老鞋匠把門關了，又聽見他那種要殺人似的聲音：</p>
<p>『死老太婆，你謀害我好啦……總有一天，我要殺了你……』</p>
<p>過了幾天，他妻子生病了。起先還聽見她低低地呻吟着起來倒馬桶，生煤爐，末後就起不來了，等老鞋匠一走出就放聲呻吟起來，……但老鞋匠仍舊是老脾氣，動不動就駡：</p>
<p>『你裝死給我看好啦……死老太婆，你磨折我……我做了工還自己燒飯……』</p>
<p>他妻子低聽地呻吟着，吃力地說：</p>
<p>『前世造孼……你摸摸我的額角……』</p>
<p>那一天，是一個陰霾的冬天的早晨，老鞋匠一早起來生煤爐，大概是給煤烟逼得苦了，又惡狠狠地咒駡起來。</p>
<p>『死老太婆你怎麽不會死的……你磨折我……』</p>
<p>過了一回，突然聽見老鞋匠絕望地號叫：</p>
<p>『啊，老太婆；……你怎的……啊，老太婆死了……』</p>
<p>他發瘋似的跑到自來水龍頭的踏板上，嗄着喉嚨叫起來：</p>
<p>『老太婆要死了……啊老太婆，你怎的……』</p>
<p>他又跑進去狠命地搖着老太婆逐漸僵硬的身體；舖板要掙斷了似的碰響着。我們遠遠地站在門口，不敢跑進去：只聽見老鞋匠發瘋似的頓着脚，滿臉都是眼淚鼻涕，還不住地搖着她。</p>
<p>『老太婆，你……啊，做什麽要死呢……』</p>
<p>第二天，幾個人來把尸體抬走了。老鞋匠起先還無聲地流着眼淚，等尸體一抬走，他突然撲在空了的舖板上，像狼嗥似的號哭了起來。一回拉着自己的頭髮，一回又狠命地撕着身上的棉襖，號叫着：</p>
<p>『老太婆呀，是我不好……我磨死你……爲的什麽呢，我吃酒灌壞了心肝……我沒有心肝……』</p>
<p>老鞋匠不去做生意，也不吃飯，晚上也不睡覺。整天地圓睜着像死人一樣發呆的眼睛突然又刺人心肺地號哭起來……沒有人敢走近他。</p>
<p>過了幾天，他收拾起簡單的行李搬走……沒有人知道他到那裏去，有人說到鄕下去了，又有人說他在什麽地方看弄堂，臉瘦得只剩兩個顴骨了…</p>

<h3>China Must Rapidly Industrialize</h3>
<p>"A country is wealthy and powerful when its industry is developed." This statement has become the guiding principle for establishing a nation in recent centuries. Our country, claiming to be based on agriculture, has never had industrial scale to speak of. It was not until the late Qing Dynasty that Zeng Guofan and Li Hongzhang introduced machine industries. Although this has been going on for several decades, the development has been slow due to conservatism and a lack of pursuit of excellence. It is like a race where others are sprinting ahead, while we are moving slowly like oxen. Others are riding airplanes, while we are sitting in wheelbarrows. It is inevitable that we will lag far behind, and the poverty and weakness of the nation have their inevitable causes. We must learn from our painful experiences and catch up quickly to complete the "Industrialization of China" as the central goal of building a new China.</p>
<p>"Vast land, abundant resources, and a large population" are indeed the great advantages bestowed upon China. Why have we become so poor and weak despite having such favorable conditions? Simply put, it is because we do not know how to utilize our land, resources, and manpower. As a result, we have buried our "naturally blessed" advantages in an atmosphere of complacency and self-deprecation, and we have been called a "sleeping lion." In the world arena where the fittest survive, we need to wake up quickly, catch up, and promote the industrialization of the new China.</p>
<p>Some say that we are currently cooperating with the Allied nations in the war, and we should concentrate all our efforts on the war. To advocate for the industrialization of China now is an untimely high-sounding tune. Indeed, winning the war depends on overall strength, and economic power occupies an important position in that overall strength. While participating in the war, we also need to develop our industries and build our country. Therefore, promoting the industrialization of China is not just a high-sounding tune, but an urgent task.</p>
<p>However, for a backward agricultural country to urgently transform into an industrial country, the problem is not simple, and the work is very heavy. We might as well offer some preliminary opinions:</p>
<p>First, we need to formulate a detailed plan with a national foundation, adapting to the specific products, climate, and other resources and natural conditions of each region to determine industrial categories. The relationship between heavy and light industries should be appropriately arranged, taking into account the convenience of transportation. At the same time, we should set a deadline for gradual implementation and complete it as quickly as possible. This plan should be formulated by a committee organized by the government, inviting experts from various departments, as well as representatives from various industrial sectors, to discuss and formulate it, in order to combine theory and practical experience and achieve smooth implementation. After drafting the plan, select the parts that can be made public, publish them, and solicit opinions from the public to gather wisdom and achieve the most reasonable and perfect outcome. Once it is finalized, we must overcome all difficulties and implement it thoroughly.</p>
<p>Second, we must clearly define the scope of state-owned and private enterprises. Those that cannot generate profits but have strong capital should be state-owned. Generally, heavy industry and basic industry should be state-owned. The government should not take back private industries that already have a foundation unless absolutely necessary. The government should not aim for profits and compete with the people for profit.</p>
<p>Third, state-owned industries must have a rational organizational structure, make full use of production equipment, improve production efficiency, value specialized technical personnel, and adjust management positions. Those who only know how to be officials and do not know how to work should never be allowed to set foot in the industrial sector and become a blight on the community.</p>
<p>Fourth, the central government should establish a special department in charge of industry. The focus of its work should be to implement the entire industrialization plan, oversee state-owned industries, and supervise and guide private industries. For private industries, it should pay attention to their technological improvements, increased production efficiency, loan of funds, and convenience of product transportation.</p>
<p>Fifth, we should cultivate industrial specialists. The education sector should focus on industrial technology departments, reduce the number of liberal arts and law programs in universities, raise the standards of mathematics and science subjects in middle schools, and encourage students to study practical subjects, taking pride in becoming engineers. Vocational training classes should be established in greater numbers. All orphanages, refuges for children in distress, and other children without guardians should be taught skills as much as possible to cultivate a large number of skilled workers.</p>
<p>Sixth, we should improve the treatment of workers, protect their livelihoods, develop their own organizations, and give them the opportunity to participate in production management. At the same time, we should reasonably shorten working hours, increase work intensity, increase the number of shifts, and adopt work competitions to stimulate a competitive spirit and improve work efficiency.</p>
<p>In summary, although completing industrialization is a complex task with many details and heavy responsibilities, if we can grasp the key points, proceed step by step, persevere, and be determined, one day success will come naturally. As the saying goes, "Where there is a will, there is a way." Let us also look at our friendly nation, Japan. Its strength today is due to the development of its industry, which is the result of only a few decades of hard work. Success depends on human effort, and I would like to encourage my fellow countrymen to strive for it together.</p>

<h3>Another Painful Defeat for British Indian Troops</h3>
<p>According to the announcement by the Imperial Headquarters on the 8th: Since occupying the area north of Azangbu near the Indian-Burmese border, Japanese army units have repelled the offensive of two British Indian divisions since late December of last year. In early March of this year, a major encirclement operation was launched, capturing and annihilating the main force of the enemy on the banks of the Ma Yu River. At present, they are still mopping up the remaining enemies.</p>
<p>Looking back, shortly after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army began to attack Burma. In just over four months, they completely defeated the British and Indian Allied forces from Burma, leaving the enemy at a loss. No one will remember this lesson more deeply than the enemy themselves. However, the enemy does not regret it and still shouts "Recapture Burma," even driving its troops, based on the 14th Division, which is known as the strongest in the British Indian army, across the Indian border and acting foolishly in front of the Japanese army. This strongest unit in the British Indian army has suffered another devastating blow due to the Japanese army's skillful strategy and bravery. The strategic loss to the enemy in this campaign is undoubtedly enormous. At the same time, the psychological impact on the enemy's soldiers, and even more so on the Indian people, must be extremely profound, which is not difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>Since October of last year, the enemy, Britain, has frequently publicized its imminent launch of an active offensive to "recapture Burma," making boastful statements, claiming that "the Japanese army is busy fighting in the Pacific and New Guinea... now is the perfect opportunity to attack the Japanese army in Burma." Therefore, the enemy's move to cross the Indian border, based on the unit touted as the strongest in the British Indian army, can be seen as based on the above observations. However, the Japanese army's lineup in Burma is actually a highly skilled and strong force. In addition, the entire Burmese people fully understand Japan's true intentions, and their cooperation with the Japanese army's operations is unwavering, leaving the enemy with no opportunity to exploit.</p>
<p>On the other hand, regarding the enemy's combat actions, as stated by Army Press Chief Tanihagi: "The British army usually uses Indian soldiers as shields in the front, while they often stay in the rear to supervise the battle. If the battle situation is unfavorable, they always retreat first." The enemy, Britain, has never ceased its exploitation and oppression of the Indian people for over two hundred years. Now, even though Britain is on the verge of destruction, they still chain the Indian people, using them as shields for British soldiers, continuing their desperate war. It is only natural that many Indian soldiers, realizing the foolishness of fighting the Japanese army, surrender to the Japanese army. The Indian people should fully recognize the cruelty of the British army and avoid becoming shields for the British army. India and Burma are connected, and if the Indian people are determined to avoid becoming sacrifices for the British army, then their bright future is at hand.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the fact that the Japanese army in Burma has once again achieved such brilliant results is due to the skillful strategy and bravery of the Japanese army's small forward units, who have continued for two months to block the enemy's large forces, as well as the agile naval mobility of the subsequent support forces, and have overcome unimaginable difficulties such as crossing the steep Arakan Mountains at an altitude of two to three thousand meters. The one hundred million people in the rear of Japan do not know how to express their gratitude and appreciation for the hard work of these loyal and courageous soldiers.</p>
<p>Regarding the request from Chongqing for increased transportation of supplies, the United States and Britain use the recapture of Burma as a prerequisite and the only excuse to alleviate Chongqing's anxiety and suffering. At the same time, the United States and Britain themselves are well aware of the importance of the "recapture of Burma" in terms of both political and military strategy. However, at the same time, they are now probably aware that their call to "recapture Burma" is strategically completely impossible. However, US Secretary of the Army Stimson and the British military leadership are still using such words to deceive: "Due to the arrival of the rainy season and the difficulty of transporting the British army, it is almost impossible to recapture Burma this spring." In many senses, Burma is now a firmly fortified link in the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and it forms a huge Japanese army stronghold for the adjacent Indian army and Yunnan Chongqing army, capable of inflicting a painful blow on the enemy.

<h3>Special Envoy Chen Gongbo Returns to Nanjing After Completing Mission to Japan - Paid Respects to Chairman Wang Yesterday to Report on Visit to Japan - Cordial Talks with Japanese Authorities Result in Satisfactory Outcome</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) Since our National Government joined the war, friendly nations have returned special administrative concessions in various places, the area of the Beijing Legation, and abolished restrictions on the movement of waste materials, providing various assistance to our country in completing independence and establishing a wartime system. In order to express gratitude and to have frank and cordial talks with the Japanese authorities on the issue of completing the war, the National Government specially appointed Legislative Yuan President Chen Gongbo as a special envoy to visit Japan. After receiving the order to visit Japan, Special Envoy Chen, accompanied by his entourage, Sun Lifu, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Shen Guanzhun, Counselor of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, Huang Pusheng, Counselor of the Propaganda Department, and Lin Ji, Senior Secretary of the Legislative Yuan, departed from Beijing at 10:30 AM on the 6th of this month to go to Japan. While in Japan, Chen visited Minister Tani and held various cordial talks. On the 8th, he met with the Japanese Emperor and was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun. On the 11th, Special Envoy Chen, having completed his mission, immediately went to the Imperial Palace to bid farewell and returned to the country, briefly stopping in Beijing. He took a flight back to the capital yesterday (the 18th) at 2:35 PM, accompanied by his entourage. Those who went to the airport to welcome him included Peng Yiming, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, Lin Baisheng, Minister of Propaganda, Chen Junhui, Minister of Construction, He Bingxian, Director-General of the Economic Management Office, Zhou Longxiang, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Deng Zuyu, Director-General of the Capital Police Department, Cai Peixin, the newly appointed Ambassador to Japan, Zhao Yusong, Minister of Personnel, Liu Yangshan, Deputy Director of Education of the Central Youth Cadre School, Mai Lanxi, Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Zhang Tao, President of the Capital Supreme Court, Li Changjiang, Commander-in-Chief of the First Army, Wu Tunan (representative) of the Legislative Yuan, and all colleagues from the Legislative Yuan. After disembarking, Special Envoy Chen looked vigorous and nodded to the welcomers. Chen then took a car directly to the Chairman's residence to pay respects to the Chairman and report on his visit to Japan.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) Chen Gongbo, President of the Legislative Yuan of the National Government and Mayor of Shanghai Special Municipality, visited Japan this month as the National Government's Special Ambassador to Japan. During his week-long stay in Japan, he exchanged opinions frankly with Prime Minister Tojo and other Japanese government leaders, and the results were very satisfactory. On his way back, he made a brief stop in Beijing. He took a flight back to Beijing today and immediately paid respects to Chairman Wang, reporting in detail on the results of his trip. This was the first time the National Government sent Chen to Japan after China joined the war. Therefore, not only has he widely publicized the new situation in China to the Japanese government and public, enabling them to gain a new understanding, but it has also enabled the Sino-Japanese relationship after the National Government's participation in the war to enter a new stage. As a central figure in the National Government, Chen was dispatched to Japan to have sincere and frank talks with Japanese government leaders on issues such as the joint completion of the war and future Sino-Japanese relations. He will certainly achieve considerable results. Therefore, in the future, China and Japan will jointly embark on a new situation of completing the joint war, and Special Envoy Chen can contribute his valuable experience of inspecting Japan's highly wartime system to the National Government's wartime policies. It is especially hoped that he will vigorously promote new facilities in military, political, economic, and cultural aspects.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) After Special Envoy Chen Gongbo arrived in Beijing after completing his visit to Japan, this reporter specifically asked Huang Pusheng, Counselor of the Propaganda Department, who accompanied him, about the current situation in Japan under the wartime system. He expressed his feelings as follows: "This time, accompanying Special Envoy Gongbo to Japan, we received a grand welcome from Japan, which shows the close relationship between China and Japan today. The relationship is as close as brothers, which cannot be described in words. Since our country participated in the Greater East Asia War, Japan has regarded our country not only as a friend, but as a brother. This time, the return of concessions and the abolition of unequal treaties have shown their sincere moral feelings and determination to help China become an independent and autonomous country. It goes without saying that during the current war, all Japanese citizens are enduring hardships and working hard, uniting as one to complete the Greater East Asia War. I went to Fukuoka and Tokyo and saw that the general Japanese public was enthusiastically carrying out air defense exercises, and the women were all wearing air defense uniforms. I admired them greatly. Wherever Special Envoy Chen went, the citizens of each street stood at attention and saluted, which shows the Japanese people's enthusiasm for China, which we cannot help but be grateful for."</p>
<h3>Meeting with Reporters in Beijing</h3>
<p>Beijing, 18th (Central News Agency) Chen Gongbo, Special Envoy of the National Government to Japan, met with reporters at Qin Zheng Dian in Zhongnanhai here at 4:30 PM on the 17th and answered various questions raised by the group. He emphasized that after China joined the war, the Central Government had high expectations for the four provinces and three municipalities in the North. The following is a summary of the questions and answers: Question: What are your impressions of Japan under wartime conditions? Answer: The Japanese people, from top to bottom, are united in their belief in victory, and their tense situation is deeply moving. Japan's rationing system is very complete, so the people across the nation have no sense of unease in their lives. This is especially admirable to me. Question: What are the solutions to the food problem in North China? Answer: China's food production in the past could not meet its own needs. This is not only the case in the northern provinces and cities. In the past, China imported an average of 16 million dan of rice and over 9 million dan of flour and wheat per year. Now, because imports are not as smooth as in the past, we are seeking countermeasures such as increasing production and other methods. First of all, we should strive to unblock the exchange of goods between the North and the South in order to alleviate the difficult food situation. Question: What are the Central Government's expectations for the northern provinces and cities? Answer: In order to complete the Greater East Asia War, the northern provinces and cities bear the extremely important and great mission of being a logistics base. Therefore, the Central Government has high expectations for the northern provinces and cities. Some people believe that China has three parts, North, South, and Central, which is a huge mistake. We must never say that the northern provinces and cities have any special circumstances. Historically speaking in China, we do not dare to say that there are special circumstances. In short, after joining the war, the whole country of China has already united as one, determined to concentrate its strength and strive to complete the war.</p>
<p>Beijing, 18th (Central News Agency) Chen Gongbo, Special Envoy of the National Government to Japan, before returning home after completing his mission to Japan, visited Japanese Minister Shiiozawa and General Okamura, Supreme Commander of the Japanese North China Expeditionary Army, on the 19th to express his gratitude for the Japanese government's and people's kindness and to express his determination to complete the war. On the 16th, he also held cordial talks with Su Tiren and Wang Yintai, supervisors of the Education and Industry General Offices of the North China Political Affairs Commission, and Vice President Yu of the New People's Society. On the 17th, he exchanged views separately with Zhu Shijing, supervisor of the Finance General Office, and Qi Xieyuan, supervisor of the Security and Internal Affairs General Office. Then, he met with a group of reporters. After completing all the events, he took a flight back to Nanjing at 11:00 AM today.</p>
<h3>German Government Appoints Wellmann as New Ambassador to China - Welcomed by All Sectors in Our Country</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) At the end of last year, the German government transferred its Ambassador to China, Stahmer, to become Ambassador to Japan. The vacancy for Ambassador to China was officially announced on the 17th to be filled by Wellmann, the Director of the Political Affairs Bureau of the German Foreign Ministry. Wellmann has extremely flexible diplomatic skills and is one of the most talented people in the German Foreign Ministry. His appointment as Ambassador to China proves the German government's emphasis on the National Government and Sino-Japanese relations. After Stahmer was transferred to be Ambassador to Japan, Germany temporarily appointed Gode as Acting Ambassador to China, but since China's participation in the war, the situation in various aspects of China has undergone rapid changes, and the position of Ambassador cannot be vacant for a long time. At the same time, the National Government also hopes that the German government will send a new ambassador as soon as possible. Therefore, the decision to appoint Wellmann as Ambassador to China will enable him to work with Ambassador Stahmer in Japan to strengthen Axis relations after he takes office. From the perspective of the Greater East Asia wartime situation, Germany's preparations for expanding its diplomatic lineup in China and Japan have significant implications. Therefore, the National Government welcomes the German government's appointment of Wellmann as the new Ambassador to China.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) Since the German Ambassador to China, Stahmer, was appointed as Ambassador to Japan, the vacancy has lasted for three months. The selection of his successor has been of great concern to all sectors of our country. The German Foreign Ministry has officially announced that Dr. Wellmann, Deputy Secretary of State and Director of the Political Department of the Foreign Ministry, will be Ambassador to China. All sectors of our country have welcomed Wellmann's appointment to our country, and it can be predicted that Sino-German relations will become more cordial in the future.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) The German government's appointment of Dr. Wellmann as its new ambassador to our country was approved by our government in advance. Dr. Wellmann has served in the diplomatic field for many years. His presence in our country will make the relations between China and Germany closer. It is truly gratifying. It is reported that the new ambassador will come to China to take office soon. A brief biography of the new ambassador is provided below: Ambassador Wellmann is 61 years old this year. He was originally a prominent figure in the Hamburg shipping industry. He participated in the German delegation to the Paris Peace Conference. From 1936 to 1938, he served as Minister to the UK, and then returned to the German Foreign Ministry. He is an expert on British issues and has many years of history in the diplomatic field. Most recently, he served as Director of the Political Department of the German Foreign Ministry before being transferred to his current position.</p>

The general idea was: "We deeply know that the only way to save China is through peace. Now the construction of a new China is progressing step by step. We must thoroughly understand the true meaning of peace and understand the significance of the National Government's participation in the Greater East Asia War. We must unite as one, share weal and woe with the allied countries, and strive to build a new China. We deeply hope that our compatriots who are groaning under the shackles of Chongqing and Yan'an will rise up quickly, abandon the past anti-Japanese ideas, join the peace camp, and jointly shoulder the heavy responsibility of building a new China. This is the only correct way to save China."</p>

<p>Tianjin, 18th (Central News Agency) Morita Yuki Ketsuro, a Japanese resident of Qingdao Street, has been researching the use of alcohol instead of gasoline. With a special vaporization device on the internal combustion engine of the car, he has recently succeeded. This special vaporization device can use alcohol and sorghum liquor. Its driving ability is 7.1 kilometers per kilogram of alcohol, and gasoline is 8 kilometers. The most suitable alcohol to use is that with a strength of 70% or more. This special vaporization device also has various benefits: (1) It can drive a car using alcohol only. (2) It can also be driven by mixing gasoline and vegetable oil. (3) Because it is equipped with a special motor, the initial start is also very fast. In order to make it clear to all sectors, Morita held a public test presided over by the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry here on the 17th, and the results were well received.</p>
<h3>The Second East Asia Medical Association Concludes Successfully: Foreign Minister Chu Gives a Speech on the Effectiveness of Tai Chi Exercises</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The Second East Asia Medical Association conference, after two days of special and general lectures by dozens of individuals, achieved significant results and has now concluded successfully. The details of today (18th) are recorded as follows: The meeting commenced at 8:00 AM. The first speaker was Chinese Foreign Minister Chu Minyi, who brought various instruments and, along with an assistant, lectured and demonstrated for an hour. Mr. Chu spoke about "Tai Chi Exercises," which he has been promoting and researching for thirteen years. This exercise is the most profound of Chinese national arts, and many researchers throughout history have studied it. Mr. Chu has gained particular insights, making his lecture highly engaging for the audience. The afternoon session opened with Mr. Chu presiding. Following him was Professor Ogata Ihiro of Manchukuo Medical University, who gave a special lecture titled "The Impact of Manchukuo's Climate, Especially Cold Weather, on the Body's Temperature Regulation." He presented his academic research, making significant contributions to medicine. The general lectures included a presentation by Dr. Uchibayashi Koji of the Tokyo University Medical Department, titled "Opium and Narcotic Drug Addiction: An Important Problem in East Asia." He presented a report based on experiments conducted at the Beijing "Drug Rehabilitation Center" and strongly emphasized that the opium problem is a crucial issue for East Asia and an urgent task for East Asian medical scholars. Subsequently, Ohira Tokuzo, a health technical supervisor from the Ministry of People's Livelihood of Manchukuo, provided a thorough explanation of the opium problem in Manchukuo and called upon medical scholars to pay attention to the opium issues in China and Manchukuo. Following presentations of personal research findings by Chinese medical scholars such as Chen Taiyi, the conference concluded successfully. At 5:00 PM, all attendees went to Shimonotsuke Seiyo-ken for a dinner hosted by Dr. Hayashi Haruo, President of the East Asia Medical Association, and planned to visit the Temporary Army First Hospital for observation on the 19th.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) – The 18th was the second day of the Second East Asia Medical Association. Foreign Minister Chu Minyi brought twelve types of instruments, including pressure gauges, lifting force gauges, and pressing force gauges, to explain the effectiveness of Tai Chi exercises, stating, "The active maintenance and enhancement of health lie in the cultivation of the body and mind. However, the methods for cultivating the body and mind should not be overly difficult, so that anyone can practice them at any time is valuable." At this point, Dr. Chu used the instruments on the table to explain various methods for measuring physical strength. He then explained Tai Chi exercises, saying that they originated from the Chuan Zhang of the Wudang School in the Chinese martial arts world during the Song Dynasty. He further applied modern medical principles for improvement and supplementation, making them different from European and American exercise methods. While the two may appear similar at first glance, their operational principles are clearly different. Dr. Chu then called out an assistant, first having him demonstrate Tai Chi exercises, and then tossing eggs and pebbles into the air to explain the principles of its soft movements. Subsequently, using the assistant as a demonstrator, he practically demonstrated the movements of Tai Chi exercises, dividing them into hand, waist, and leg sections, with ten movements in detail. He then screened a film of Tai Chi exercises, introducing their actual state for ten minutes. Finally, Dr. Chu explained the advantages of Tai Chi exercises, which are that they do not take time, do not require effort, and do not cost money. The attending representatives from various countries listened attentively and recognized this as a purely Chinese style of exercise, praising it unanimously.</p>

<h3>Axis Forces Rely on Favorable Terrain to Launch Counteroffensive in Northern Tunisia, Concentrating Forces in an Attempt to Retake Jebel Ang, with Heavily Mined and Machine-Gunned Fortifications Impregnable</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – Reports indicate that in the Tunisian theater, the Axis forces, within the anti-Axis crescent-shaped encirclement from near Enfidaville in the south to Sedjenane in the north, and extending westward to Bou Arada, have relied on favorable terrain to repel the anti-Axis offensive and are seizing the opportunity to counterattack. Fierce battles are currently underway in various locations against the anti-Axis forces. However, according to dispatches from Algiers, anti-Axis Commander Eisenhower, in a reception for reporters on the 17th, discussed the situation in Tunisia, pointing out that the prospects are not optimistic. He stated, "The anti-Axis forces still need to go through this great battle to drive the Axis forces out of North Africa. The only difficulty for the anti-Axis forces in future operations is the excellent quality of the German army. The mines laid by the Axis forces are also one of the difficulties for anti-Axis operations." According to dispatches from Washington, D.C., U.S. wartime intelligence director Davis, in reporting on the war situation, touched on the Tunisian theater, stating, "The Tunisian campaign has entered its final stage. Although Rommel's army has retreated to the north, its base has become a solid fortress, approximately 100 miles long and 30 miles wide." According to news from North Africa, fierce battles occurred in the northern region on the 16th. The war situation in various locations is noted as follows: (1) After a recent fierce battle between the anti-Axis forces and the Axis forces, they occupied Jebel Ang. However, the Axis forces in that area seem to be trying to counterattack. According to a dispatch from the United Press correspondent, British reconnaissance pilots reported that General Arnim has assembled Axis forces, preparing to retake Jebel Ang. (2) The French rebel forces southeast of Bou Arada suffered a major blow from the Axis forces from the 14th to the 15th, and suffered another heavy blow, so they had to temporarily halt their offensive. There was nothing to report on the situation in that area on the 16th. (3) In the southern region, British reconnaissance teams and assault teams had local skirmishes with small units of the Axis forces near Enfidaville.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – There is no change in the Tunisian front. Messages from the US military and French rebel forces also acknowledged last night that the Axis forces in the northeast bridgehead are continuing to put up a resolute resistance and are counterattacking in several places, using mines and other methods to hinder anti-Axis operations. According to the United Press of America, the current fighting on the northern front is the most intense in the entire African war. General Anderson's British First Army and its support units encountered fierce resistance as they advanced beyond Jebel Ang. It was previously reported that Jebel Ang had fallen into the hands of the anti-Axis forces. British reconnaissance planes said that General Arnim was seen concentrating troops, estimating that these troops were preparing to retake Jebel Ang. Anti-Axis reconnaissance teams operating north of Enfidaville against Axis transportation lines have discovered many mined areas and machine gun positions, so the anti-Axis side expects not to begin an attack until a sufficient heavy artillery force has been moved to the front. This will probably take several days, as the terrain is rugged and there are no roads, making it difficult to move the necessary artillery into position.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to the Transocean News Agency military correspondent, there were intense battles of a local nature in northwestern Tunisia on Friday, especially in the northern part of the western front. General Anderson has tried repeatedly with the greatest perseverance to capture the overlooking heights northeast of Béja and north and northwest of Méjez el-Bab. In the Béja area, attacking British and French troops engaged in fierce battles with counterattacking German troops. Although only a portion of the troops was used on both sides, the fighting was extremely fierce. Several peaks changed hands several times within a day, so it is currently difficult to obtain an accurate picture of the situation there. But what is known is that the claim spread by the anti-Axis side that the anti-Axis army has broken through the entire German front north of Méjez el-Bab does not correspond to the facts. Even if British troops have indeed broken through the Axis positions in a few locations, they have been repelled to their original locations by German counterattacks. The anti-Axis forces have a large number of reserve troops available. Therefore, the fighting in this area will not only continue unabated, but will become even more intense. Conversely, the area southeast of Bou Arada was quieter on Friday. Most of the French rebel forces under Giraud are fighting in this area. After suffering serious blows from the Axis forces on Wednesday and Thursday, they are currently apparently still recovering. There have been several small-scale engagements on the southern front. British reconnaissance teams and assault teams attempted to break through the ring of barriers laid by the Axis forces around their Enfidaville positions, but failed. At times, both sides exchanged long-range artillery fire. It is currently difficult to predict when General Montgomery's British Eighth Army will begin its large-scale attack.</p>
<h3>Germany's "Atlantic Wall" Completed: Hopes for Anglo-American Opening of Second Front Dashed</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – A special correspondent for the German News Agency reports that the construction of the "Atlantic Wall," ordered by German Führer Hitler, has been completed in less than a year. Standing on the site where U.S. forces first set foot on French soil during World War I, one can overlook this great defensive engineering project that will endure for centuries. High-altitude anti-aircraft artillery, artillery guns, machine gun positions, tank defense engineering, and munitions storage areas are all clearly visible. The cement walls are over three feet thick. The coastline is covered with solid defensive points, especially at river mouths, harbors, and submarine bases. The construction of this project was largely carried out by foreign workers. Behind the wall, German divisions stand watch diligently, and any enemy attempting to land will be immediately bombarded. The British army suffered a severe blow in Dieppe last summer, at which time there were only temporary defense lines. The completed "Atlantic Wall" is many times more robust than before.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to General Steel-Fleet, a military commentator for the Transocean News Agency, there was considerable fighting in Tunisia between April 10 and 16. Field Marshal Rommel's forces, seeking to shorten the front line, have withdrawn from Kairouan and Sousse. North of these two locations, new fighting has begun. The anti-Axis forces are also increasing pressure from the west, but all attacks have been repelled. The German Air Force is also effectively assisting ground troops, concentrating attacks on enemy supply bases and rear transportation lines. Fighting in this area will generally continue. On the Eastern Front, there was only limited significant fighting during that week. The Soviet army regards the Kupyansk bridgehead as a thorn in its side, and has attacked it repeatedly. The commentator also said that the recently announced "Atlantic Wall" should not be ignored. The wall stretches from the Pyrenees to the German border, a distance of over 2,700 kilometers. The principle of its construction is very different from the famous Western Wall, which is only 850 kilometers long. In 1939, Britain and France were extremely wary of this wall and did not dare to take any risks. The assistance promised to the Netherlands included inland fortresses around submarine bases and naval strongholds to prevent paratroopers from attacking from the rear and to prevent the enemy from attempting to land. Therefore, the strongest fortifications are set up around ports and river mouths. However, relying solely on defensive fortifications cannot guarantee a country's immunity from invasion, so manpower is still needed to defend them, as demonstrated by the Maginot Line and the Metaxas Line. The Atlantic Wall is defended by elite troops, making it unbreakable. These troops are not as complacent as the French troops on the Maginot Line. If the enemy attempts to land, these troops will attack from all sides, as in the Dieppe raid. This extensible line of defense also has roads for quickly transferring motorized reserves to critical locations. There is little hope that the enemy will be able to establish a second front in Western Europe.</p>
<h3>British Planes Night Raid German Industrial Areas, Losing Over 100 Aircraft</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to German military authorities, British air force units carried out another large-scale bombing raid on German industrial areas on the 16th night, but returned after suffering heavy losses. Experts criticized this fairly large-scale air raid, saying that Britain is now launching large-scale night attacks again, but it must be understood that it is almost impossible to accurately bomb specific targets at night in front of Germany's powerful air defense positions. This bombing by British planes is really no different from scattering a large number of bombs over a wide area. Therefore, although citizens near factories have suffered damage, the factories have not suffered much damage. Although Britain has made extensive publicity about the bombing effect, we really don't understand what the purpose of Britain's bombing is this time. The British planes bombed continuously from the 16th to the 17th afternoon. In such a large-scale air raid lasting 24 hours, the British raiding team suffered unprecedentedly heavy losses. More than 100 British aircraft were shot down, mostly large bombers with four engines. Checking the wreckage of enemy aircraft, with an average of ten bodies per aircraft, the loss of airmen must be over a thousand. This glorious great victory cannot but be grateful to the brave men of the anti-aircraft artillery units and night fighter squadrons.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – Officials here said today that when U.S. aircraft attacked Bremen yesterday, 20 four-engine bombers were shot down by the Germans, and the Germans only lost two fighter planes. In this battle, residential areas were hit, and many people were injured or killed. At the same time, British aircraft lost seven aircraft in the western region and over the sea yesterday.</p>
<h3>German and British Ships Engage in Fierce Battle Near Brighton</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reports that in the early hours of April 16, a British destroyer, protected by two motor torpedo boats, engaged in a fierce battle with the German coastal fleet near the coast north of Brighton. Although the enemy's firepower was superior, the German ships responded properly, and finally destroyed one of the enemy's motor torpedo boats, and the large one was lost. During the enemy's second attack, one of the German ships suffered considerable damage. The British destroyer captain believed that this was a good opportunity to capture the German ship, so he gradually approached it, intending to send sailors to climb onto the German ship. The German crew waited for them to approach, and used hand grenades as weapons to resist. Finally, a damaged machine gun was suddenly repaired by a German sailor, and fired at the British sailors who were preparing to board the ship. The British were caught off guard, and suffered many casualties. The ship then fled in a panic, and all the German ships returned to defense safely.</p>
<h3>Muddy Season on Eastern Front Coming to an End: German Army Completes Preparations for Major Battle, Soviet Offensives in Kupyansk Area Repelled</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to the Transocean News Agency military correspondent, the southern section of the Eastern Front has entered a true summer climate, with the temperature exceeding 20 degrees Celsius. In the central and northern sections, the temperature has also risen to 10 degrees, so the muddy season should end by the end of April, and the current lull in fighting may also end. However, the development of the situation does not depend entirely on the climate; the decisions of the armies of both sides account for the largest component. The German defense lines have been prepared to deal with any eventuality, all the German troops who participated in the winter fighting have been rested, and fresh troops are arriving at the front from the country in a steady stream. Munitions and fuel supplies have also been prepared in abundance. We should note that since the end of the winter campaign, the German army has occupied positions that are advantageous for both offense and defense. Therefore, once the spring muddy season ends, the German army will be able to move completely freely.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Central News Agency) – The German official news agency announced last night that the German army again fought fierce defensive battles on the left and repelled the Soviet army attacking the Kupyansk bridgehead and the upper reaches of the Donets River. The Soviet army used a large number of tanks to assist in a concentrated attack on the southeast of the Kupyansk bridgehead, but failed to gain a foothold anywhere. It is said that the Soviet army lost 28 tanks, and three infantry regiments were completely wiped out. After a long period of silence, the Soviet army in the upper reaches of the Donets River attacked in two places, but the German army was prepared to repel them. At another location, powerful German troops isolated and surrounded a Soviet unit. A Reuters correspondent in Moscow said that a few major roads in the Kupyansk area are gradually drying out, and both sides are preparing for the final battle to seize the bridgehead.</p>
<h3>Major Changes in German Diplomatic Personnel</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – It was announced here last night that Dr. Wellman, the German Foreign Office Assistant Undersecretary and former head of the Political Department of the Foreign Office, has been formally appointed as Ambassador to China. According to a communiqué from the German Führer's headquarters, former German Ambassador to China Steimar was transferred to the post of Ambassador to Japan several months ago, and Wellman is now his successor. Former Ambassador to the United States Dickhoff was appointed as Ambassador to Spain; Foreign Office Undersecretary Weizsäcker was appointed as Ambassador to the Holy See. In addition, the communiqué also announced several important personnel changes in the German Foreign Office, including the appointment of First Secretary Maultandt as Undersecretary of State, succeeding Weizsäcker; Hans Hank, counselor at the German Embassy in Spain, was promoted to Undersecretary of State and Director of the Political Department of the Foreign Office, succeeding Wellman; and the famous diplomats Dr. Gauss, Lintron, and Schwiell were all promoted to the rank of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary.</p>
<h3>Chinese, American, and German Overseas Chinese Return Home, Arriving in Portugal</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – Four hundred and four German Overseas Chinese, mostly women and children, who were repatriated from the Central American countries of Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Honduras, arrived here yesterday aboard the Spanish ship "Comillas". They will continue their voyage home next Wednesday.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Burma Reaps War Gains, Annihilating a British Brigade – Captured Captain Recounts the Experience</h3>
<p>Bay of Bengal, 18th (Central News Agency) – Japanese troops crushed the British Second Division Sixth Brigade at a key position on April 6th. At that time, the British-Indian mixed army 47th Brigade, which was guarding near Udongbeku in southern Maungdaw Peninsula, collapsed at the first blow of the Japanese army and fled north. But the retreat route had already been cut off by the Japanese army, so it was almost completely wiped out by the Japanese army ambushing in India. In this battle, Indian Army Captain Singh, staff officer of the British Brigade Headquarters, was captured. According to him, the British-Indian army's intrusion into the Arakan region was still an action started to reopen the Yunnan-Burma Road. Now the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road is hopeless, especially the fighting near India can be said to have ended in a great victory for the Japanese army. At first, I was stationed behind Laubek, and soon the Japanese army attacked from the central Mayu Mountains to the rear of Laubek, which was really unexpected. I came into contact with the Japanese army for the first time. What impressed me most was that I learned that the Japanese army were brave and good at fighting. Someone asked me why Indians, who longed for independence to be realized soon, were so indirectly supporting Britain's control of India and fighting for the British. I can answer that if the British want to prevent the collapse of the British Empire, they will try their best to lure Indians into the army to fight, regardless of the quality or race of the troops. Although Japan has repeatedly issued statements to India, Britain has always tried its best to prevent the purpose of Japan's statements from deeply affecting India. I also only now know about the Japanese government's statement that it will permit Burma to be independent within the year. I firmly believe that Burma's independence will definitely have a profound and far-reaching impact on the minds of our Indians.</p>
<h3>Japanese Greater East Asia Minister Aoki Visits Vietnam, Vietnamese Express Welcome</h3>
<p>Saigon, 18th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki's visit to the South this time is of great significance. The people of Vietnam, both high and low, are extremely excited after hearing the news that Mr. Aoki will arrive in Vietnam soon to hold a cordial conversation with Vietnamese leaders. Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Vietnam had already deeply understood Japan's position in East Asia. As early as June of the 29th year of the Republic of China, it was the first to recognize Japan's dispatch of a monitoring team to Vietnam to assist in blocking the supply route to Chongqing. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War in December of the following year, the relationship between Japan and Vietnam became even closer. During the battles of Malaya and Burma, Vietnam further expressed its active cooperation in the Greater East Asia War and concluded various agreements with Japan. The progress of the relationship between Japan and Vietnam can be said to be extremely rapid and smooth. Therefore, Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia is very eager to visit Vietnam as soon as possible during his inspection of the South, in order to quickly learn about the real situation in Vietnam, which is cooperating in the Greater East Asia War, and to hold cordial conversations with the Vietnamese authorities. Officials and civilians in Vietnam are all very welcoming of Mr. Aoki's visit.</p>
<h3>Burma Selects People's Representatives to Visit Japan in Batches</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 17th (Central News Agency) – Since Burmese Governor Ba Maw visited Japan, it has aroused the nationwide desire of the Burmese people to visit Japan. In particular, young men and women here all deeply wish to be able to visit Japan. In order to adapt to this kind of Japan fever among the Burmese, the Military Administration Department decided to select fifty representatives from all walks of life in Burma, including politics, industry, and education, to send to Japan for visits and inspections. The selection of candidates has now begun. The first batch of eighteen people is scheduled to depart next month, and the second and third batches of sixteen people each are also scheduled to depart in May and June. It is planned that they will all stay in Japan for three months.</p>
<h3>Historical Materials on Columbus's Voyages Found in Seville</h3>
<p>Madrid, Spain, 18th (Central News Agency) – In the archives of a notary office in Seville, historical materials concerning Columbus's voyage to the Americas were found, containing interesting details about the hiring of ships, crew members, and wages.</p>
<h3>US Huge Shipbuilding Program Deeply Concerned by Britain</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to the German News Agency naval commentator, the British shipping industry is deeply concerned about the new shipbuilding plan set by the United States. The plan includes the construction of thousands of docks, requiring a huge amount of 560 million US dollars. Harrysen, President of the British Shipbuilding Engineering Association, recently wrote in the Financial Times, saying that "the danger of Britain losing its global shipbuilding leadership position has changed from fantasy to reality." He also said that the United States' huge shipbuilding plan of 960 million yuan is very noteworthy. Rear Admiral Maurer, Chief of the US Navy Bureau of Ships, has made repeated statements. Navy Secretary Knox also mentioned the US plan to build docks at a press conference on April 2nd. In the view of the British aviation industry, it is a mobile dock for repairing American merchant ships, but it must follow the future ocean fleet so that it can be repaired at any time when warships are damaged. However, this plan will definitely fail. If this kind of living dock has to closely follow the warship, its huge size and the large scale of the enemy air force are the best target for enemy bombs. Once this mobile dock is completed, it can be operated smoothly in places lacking ship repair docks, such as South America or the coast of South Africa, and British naval experts will suffer from it.</p>
<h3>Number of US Army and Navy Casualties Since the War</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – According to dispatches from Washington, the US Army authorities announced on the 16th the number of US Army soldiers lost since the war as follows: Since the start of the war, the US Army has lost 76,452 soldiers on the world's battlefields. Among them, more than 11,000 were killed in action, and more than 13,000 were injured.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – Washington telegrams reported that, according to the injury and death toll issued by the US Navy so far, the total number of casualties of the US Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard since the attack on Pearl Harbor is 24,819 officers and soldiers. In addition, the US Navy also continued to fear the casualties of the previous week, a total of 105 people, including 19 deaths, and 81 injured and missing.</p>
<h3>British Eighth Army Commander Arrives in Algiers</h3>
<p>Madrid, 18th (Central News Agency telegram) – According to a German news agency dispatch citing Moroccan radio, General Montgomery, commander of the British Eighth Army in Tunisia, has arrived in Algiers by plane. It is reported that Montgomery conferred with Giraud and US Fifth Army Commander Patton.</p>
<h3>Giraud Rejects Tagore's Request</h3>
<p>Tangier, 18th (Central News Agency telegram) – According to reliable sources, Giraud's written statement delivered to London by Jadrou states his rejection of Tagore's request to establish a provisional government in French North Africa and to restore the parliamentary system in France after the war. Regarding these two points, Giraud reportedly stated: "I do not wish to interfere in the matter of a provisional government. My mission is to represent French sovereignty and interests outside the French homeland and to create an army composed of men who are willing and able to fight. Regarding the parliamentary system, I do not wish to see the system that plunged us into the disasters of the 1930s restored." It is understood that the full text of the statement will be released simultaneously in Algiers, London, and Washington on Monday.</p>
<h3>Secretary-General of Italian Fascist Party Replaced</h3>
<p>Rome, 18th (Central News Agency telegram) – Italian Prime Minister Mussolini convened a meeting of the heads of the Fascist Party on the 17th and approved the resignation of the party's Secretary-General, Vizzini. He will be replaced by the current Deputy Secretary-General, Scorza. Vizzini previously served in the Spanish Civil War as a volunteer, fighting on the side of the revolutionaries, during which time he was wounded. He has now requested to resign due to health reasons and inability to endure strenuous work. He will now devote himself to assisting the families of soldiers serving in the military.</p>

The meeting was filled with the traditional spirit of friendship between Germany and Hungary. Both leaders reaffirmed their firm resolve to fight alongside the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States until final victory.</p>
<h3>Special Edition on the India-Burma Campaign: Failure of the Burma Counteroffensive Deepens Anglo-American-Chongqing Depression</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese side announced a major victory in the India-Burma border region, where two divisions of counterattacking British troops were captured and annihilated, the Anglo-American press has remained silent. However, from the perspective that the counteroffensive in Burma was a prerequisite for large-scale air raids on the Japanese mainland, this campaign has given a significant shock to the United States, which had even greater expectations than Britain. How enthusiastic were the Anglo-American-Chongqing forces about retaking Burma? And how has their depression deepened after their attempt was crushed by the fierce Japanese counterattack? Here, we present a comprehensive introduction based on information from various sources:</p>
<p>The Relationship Between Air Raids on Japan and the Burma Road</p>
<p>The thing that the United States is now focusing on and planning most is to conduct continuous large-scale air raids on Japan from the Chinese mainland, in addition to surprise air raids using Pacific bases and aircraft carriers. Therefore, the United States is making maximum use of the so-called China-India airlift route and the northern air route. Among these two air routes, the China-India air route is receiving the most attention, with continuous day and night efforts to expand and construct bases in India and China. However, the true air raid operations against Japan that the United States is attempting are not surprise attacks or intermittent raids, but rather continuous strong attacks using 200 to 300 aircraft. During his recent inspection of Chongqing, US Air Force Commander Arnold, in response to Soong Mei-ling's request for urgent assistance, cited the lack of aircraft, the danger of airlift, and the lack of gasoline, affirming the difficulty of large-scale preparations. Furthermore, the Washington dispatch of the Herald Tribune of February 28 also reported the following:</p>
<p>"Washington officials believe that if sufficient gasoline cannot be transported, then sending the 500 military aircraft requested by Chongqing is meaningless. On the one hand, because the economic situation under Chongqing's rule is extremely difficult, the United States must not only provide military assistance but also transport daily necessities to make up for the flaws in Chongqing's finances. This fact makes the transportation of gasoline doubly difficult."</p>
<p>In order for the United States to break through this situation and carry out its so-called plan to turn Japan into a wasteland, it must, in any case, secure a solid inland road. However, the current China-India routes are merely a few caravan roads traversing central Asia, so retaking the Burma Road is the only crucial task at hand.</p>
<p>The argument for retaking the Burma Road, related to large-scale air raids on the Japanese mainland, has recently generated a rapid reflection in American public opinion. The New York Times editorial stated: "The premise for large-scale air raids on the Japanese mainland is, in the minds of most military experts, none other than retaking Burma first in order to reopen the Burma Road." The Herald Tribune stated: "American strategists are burying themselves in maps to consider ways to strengthen the air force in China. Although the specific plan cannot be discussed due to military secrecy, it goes without saying that reopening the Burma Road is a prerequisite." Furthermore, Major GF Eliot also has this argument: "Whether the American air force in China can be fully equipped depends entirely on whether the China-India airlift organization can be strengthened or the Burma Road can be retaken. If the advantages and disadvantages of these two methods are compared, it is naturally the latter, that is, the reopening of the Burma Road, that is a policy that achieves twice the result with half the effort; moreover, the retaking of the Burma Road is by no means impossible."</p>
<p>What is the Large-Scale Counteroffensive Like?</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the United States is treating the counteroffensive in Burma as a prerequisite for large-scale air raid operations on the Japanese mainland, and many operational arguments have been raised clamorously. The Herald Tribune exaggerated the fact stated in the report by Franklin Ray, Minister of Arms and Lease-Lend in China, that "the large amount of lease-lend supplies transported to India are still being stored there in preparation for the Burma campaign," and said that it would not be impossible to launch a large-scale counteroffensive in Burma right now. However, informed Washington military sources say this:</p>
<p>"The large-scale counteroffensive operation in Burma probably won't begin until the end of the monsoon season in October. From mid-June, the monsoon begins to strike Burma, and the coastal areas to the tropical jungles of Burma are completely becoming breeding grounds for plague and malaria. Therefore, although the central region is relatively dry, large-scale counteroffensives cannot be launched until at least the end of the rainy season."</p>
<p>However, the most fundamental problem is still the transportation of troops and materials, which has become a common problem for the counteroffensive. It is simply impossible to realize the large-scale counteroffensive that the United States hopes for with the 500,000 troops currently in eastern India (not a single soldier or piece of armor has been dispatched from western and southern India). As a result, it must rely on the United States to transport large numbers of troops and munitions. However, it is 11,500 nautical miles from New York to Bombay via the Cape of Good Hope, and submarines pose a threat everywhere along this route. At the same time, the question of whether 10 million to 20 million tons of shipping capacity can be spared is also a problem. Therefore, the large-scale counteroffensive in Burma, like the European second front, is just talk.</p>
<p>So, what exactly can be done? The New York Times editorial of February 28 has the following answer to this question:</p>
<p>"Based on reality, the anti-Axis forces must fight on two major fronts - west from Morocco and Iceland, east to Guadalcanal and Wake Island. Whether the United States retakes Burma or strengthens the US Air Force in China, neither can be achieved as easily as Soong Mei-ling says. The so-called concentrated operations doctrine must be adopted."</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Herald Tribune's Washington dispatch, unwilling to give up, states the views of informed Washington sources:</p>
<p>"The Anglo-Americans are pursuing a strategy with defeating Hitler as the top priority. Therefore, a large-scale operation in East Asia must at least wait until the Axis forces are driven out of Tunisia. The US government's current strategy for East Asia is, on the one hand, to actively prepare for the counteroffensive in Burma; on the other hand, to strengthen the US Air Force in Chongqing. The large-scale counteroffensive in Burma will not be realized until autumn!"</p>
<p>But not a word was said about the specific plan for how to counterattack Burma.</p>
<p>America's Dilemma</p>
<p>As a result, the United States, adhering to the so-called "Europe First" doctrine, must wait until it has dealt with Europe before turning its attention to the East Asian front - especially the large-scale counteroffensive in Burma. Needless to say, the United States considers 1943 to be the "year of counteroffensive," and it is based on the premise of large-scale air raids from China to Japan. Therefore, retaking the Burma Road must be a prerequisite. As mentioned above, its ability is at least incapable of simultaneously launching two major operations spanning Eurasia. Therefore, the United States is deeply experiencing a dilemma. Thus, the United States has no choice but to maximize the strengthening and equipping of the air force in China by utilizing the China-India air route, and to decide to carry out air raids on the Japanese mainland within the possible scale; and, on the other hand, to urge the British army to counterattack Burma as much as possible. For this purpose, the British army has launched an attack on the Burmese border since February of this year, but within a month, it has been utterly defeated by the Japanese army. This common tactic of the United States of "using others as pawns" has aroused dissatisfaction and vigilance within the British Indian Army. The Reuters Karachi dispatch reported the following rather strong argument:</p>
<p>"Before the war situation improves, the British Indian Army only needs to adopt a passive defense posture against the Japanese army's threat to India. Given the unrest in India and the overwhelming superiority of the Japanese army, it is not the time to take an offensive against Japan. It is impossible to carry out a large-scale operation to retake Burma with 50,000 or 100,000 troops. We cannot bleed for the benefit of the United States itself."</p>
<p>In short, after half a year of deadly fighting on Guadalcanal, the United States' attempt to advance on the Japanese mainland from the southwestern Pacific has been thwarted. Now it is continuing its desperate efforts to carry out its counteroffensive against Japan from the northern Aleutian Islands and western Burma. Therefore, its future trends should be even more closely guarded. - A Special Correspondent in Buenos Aires, Argentina (Ding: Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi, April 10)</p>
<h3>The Arien Unit Achieves Extraordinary Feats</h3>
<p>(Dispatched by Oono and Inatomi, Special Correspondents on the Burma Front) The enemy clamored to retake the Burma Road to aid Chiang Kai-shek. This time, the British army first advanced towards the Japanese air base at Akyab. The Japanese army fought bravely to meet the enemy and launched a major annihilation battle in the Irrawaddy River Valley. In this campaign, the Arien Unit, which outflanked the enemy's rear, fought valiantly and made extraordinary contributions. With its small number of determined troops, it broke through the center of the enemy's formation. The indescribable hardships and the spirit of courageous advance can be said to be the blossoming flowers in this major annihilation battle. Without drinking or eating for 70 days, they advanced into roadless territory, broke through the severe terrain of the Arakan Mountains, and completed a 2,300-kilometer march.</p>
<p>In late December of last year, the concealed Arien Unit began to advance secretly northward to Mandalay with its small number of troops. At that time, the Japanese army was trying to destroy the enemy's stubborn counterattack in one fell swoop, and was secretly gathering its forces in the Akyab area. Akyab, which had become a Japanese air base, was blocked on the right by the Arakan Mountains and the Irrawaddy River Valley. It was almost impossible to replenish supplies from the rear.</p>
<p>In order to overcome this difficulty, reconnaissance was dispatched to find a land bypass, which was the initial mission of the Arien Unit. At that time, the enemy army had already taken advantage of the gaps in the Japanese defense line and launched a large army mainly composed of British soldiers from the Burma-India border towards the Maungdaw-Rathedaung line, carrying dozens of tanks and more than a hundred cannons, attempting to carry out a joint counteroffensive. As a result, the area around the Arakan Mountains suddenly appeared to be the center of the enemy army. The Arien Unit was assigned only 000 soldiers under the command of the unit commander, but they dared to break into the center of the enemy army with this small number of troops and carry out a large-scale reconnaissance of the rear of Akyab. Each of the unit commander and his subordinates swore an oath upon departure that they would accomplish their determined mission.</p>
<p>The Arakan Mountains, which stretched far across the Burma-India border, were already as hot as high summer, and the upper part of the mountains extended into the cottony clouds, reflecting a purplish mountain color. The Arien Unit silently entered the dense forest from the main road and proceeded. Before they knew it, large leeches had drilled into the soldiers' uniforms or puttees. During a brief rest in the wilderness, the soldiers looked down and saw the blood flowing down. They immediately untied their puttees and saw five or six leeches gorged with blood and their bodies swollen red, falling to the ground. The unique rotten wood and fallen leaves peculiar to the dense forest had been rotting for many years, emitting a unique stench that rushed into the nose, making people unable to suppress the urge to vomit. Just when they thought they had entered the great dense forest, a high mountain suddenly appeared in front of them, blocking their way, or they were blocked by a torrent as deep as their necks, often delaying the march for several hours. Sometimes they suddenly advanced to the front of the enemy's formation, and sometimes they bypassed the enemy's formation. Relying on the skillful combination of combat and stratagem, the unit was able to continue advancing west and then west again, week after week, and had now broken into the center of the enemy's formation. However, communication with the rear base was completely cut off at that time. Needless to say, there was no supply of food, and the food they were carrying was gone in just ten days. Therefore, they had no choice but to dig up tree roots, eat grass, and drink muddy water, but they still advanced with all their hearts.</p>
<p>After crossing the upper reaches of the Kaladan River, the Arakan Mountains gradually revealed a dangerous appearance, sometimes facing deep valleys, and sometimes steep peaks and cliffs, standing tall in the clouds. The food had already run out, and the future was an uncharted, desolate place. It was truly a time of hardship at the crossroads of life and death. Therefore, they could only advance four or five kilometers a day. However, they still ignored the impossibility and silently continued westward.</p>
<p>At this time, the 00 base finally believed that the Arien Unit would inevitably be completely destroyed in the enemy's formation, and they almost despaired of their survival. It had been seventy days since they departed from the base. Without drinking or eating, they continued their determined march like ants, and had broken through 2,300 kilometers. The extremely dangerous Arakan Mountains were gradually being conquered. On the dawn of February 21, the Irrawaddy River Valley suddenly appeared before their eyes. They had unknowingly reached the enemy's rear, which was advancing from Maungdaw towards Akyab. The Arien Unit then cheered and, in order to encircle the counterattacking enemy army from the rear, continued to advance along the Irrawaddy delta towards Apaukwa.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, a reconnaissance plane from their own side landed on the ground and discovered the Arien Unit, which was greatly surprised because everyone at the base thought that the Arien Unit must have been completely destroyed in the enemy's formation. Who knew that after seventy days, they would have bypassed to the enemy's rear in the Irrawaddy River Valley, which was beyond expectation.</p>
<p>The main force on their own side was originally scheduled to start the joint attack on March 10. Now that the Arien Unit, which had been thought to be completely destroyed, had unexpectedly arrived at the enemy's rear and was about to start attacking from the enemy's rear, they naturally had to take them into consideration. Therefore, the scheduled plan was advanced. The 00 Unit then bravely launched an attack from the south to respond to the Arien Unit, pressing towards the enemy's British army. Thus, the Arien Unit's seventy days of near-death hardship could finally be rewarded. On March 8, the Arien Unit, which arrived on the right bank of the Kaladan River, immediately carried out a surprise attack on 1,200 enemy troops in the Apaukwa area, annihilating them without leaving a single soldier or soldier. Then, they went to respond to the 00 Unit that had come from the south to attack together. Thus, the seventy days of hardship they endured in the Irrawaddy River Valley developed into a major annihilation battle. Ding (...Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi, April 9)</p>
<h3>Record of Annihilation Battle in Burma</h3>
<p>With the progress of the war situation, the Hong Kong route and the Vietnam route, which were the Anglo-American blood transfusion routes to aid Chiang Kai-shek, were successively cut off. Finally, the Burma route, on which Chongqing relied as its only lifeline, was completely cut off. The anti-Japanese Chiang regime became an "orphan of East Asia," and the poverty in Chongqing deepened with each passing day. Hong Kong and Vietnam were already in the hands of the Japanese army, and the development of the Northwest Route could not proceed smoothly. Therefore, they are now calling for the retaking of Burma in order to reopen the Burma route, and are counterattacking the India-Burma border, but they are ultimately repelled by the Japanese army. The Japanese army has repeatedly cooperated closely between the air force and the ground attack units, overcoming difficult terrain and achieving brilliant results. Before the rainy season, the British Indian Army's two divisions launched a large-scale counteroffensive in the Akyab area of northern Burma, but were wiped out by the Japanese army's three-dimensional mobile operations on the banks of the Mayu River, thus breaking the enemy's attempt to attack.</p>
<p>Roosevelt's policy of strengthening supplies to Chongqing was activated after meetings between Wavell, commander of the British Indian Expeditionary Force, He Yingqin, and Luo Zhuoying. Their operational intentions became active. From around the end of December last year, a part of the British Indian Army advanced southward along the coastal road towards Akyab and Donbaik, while another part carried tanks and artillery towards the Rathedaung front in preparation for a southward advance. In response, the Japanese army also deployed troops in the Rakhaingku area, the Donbaik area, the Rathedaung front, and various areas of Akyab. Supply to Akyab depended solely on maritime transport, and enemy ships in the Bay of Bengal were constantly moving around, and enemy gunboats were also moving back and forth in the Mayu River, so the situation was indeed very dangerous. However, the Japanese army finally overcame these dangers and completed the concentration of forces in the planned schedule by the end of February.</p>
<p>During this period, the enemy often launched counterattacks. In late December and early January, there were very strong offensives, but they were all dealt heavy blows and retreated. Nothing was accomplished.</p>
<p>Operations of the Arien Unit</p>
<p>Coordinating with the concentration of forces in the Akyab area, the Arien Unit, which launched a surprise attack on the enemy from behind, advanced towards its destination through the arduous Arakan Mountains.</p>
<p>The Arakan Mountains are steep mountains with a height of 3,000 meters and untouched by humans. The soldiers of this army used gunpowder to blow up rocks and open roads along the way, traveling only four or five kilometers a day. In the seventy days since the departure, they broke through 300 kilometers and finally reached the plains on March 21. From the departure to cross the mountains, to the Kaladan River, and then to the plains, the supply of food was completely cut off. Even with aircraft reconnaissance, the unit's tracks were often not found.</p>
<p>Advance of the Main Force</p>
<p>The main force predicted the speed of the Arien Unit's advance and scheduled the date for its offensive to be around March 10. Since the unit's arrival was earlier than expected, the scheduled plan was changed, and on March 8, the two units joined forces to launch a surprise attack from behind on the enemy at Apaukwa (right bank of the Kaladan River), annihilating 1,200 captured enemies, and then turning around to defeat the enemy at Kangyokung (southwest of Apaukwa) and advanced to the banks of the Mayu River. One unit of this unit continued north, confronting the enemy in a certain area that had increased southward, while another unit advanced towards the Saingdaung area. In the battles up to March 19, a total of two enemy regiments were annihilated on the left bank of the Mayu River, and they continued north, gathering near Taungmyaung, and began preparing to cross the Mayu River.</p>
<p>At that time, there were 100 enemy gunboats and boats in the Mayu River, preventing the Japanese army from crossing the river. On the night of the 24th, the brave soldiers of this unit used civilian boats to cross the river completely unnoticed by the enemy. By the evening of the 25th, they had advanced to Ataungtana. The deadly battle of the Mayu Peninsula unit, after the brilliant achievements of the Arien Units, supported the arduous battle with a small number of troops against a large number, luring the enemy towards the Donbaik area and blocking their offensive, making extremely great contributions. The enemy was also astonished by the display of its highest level of defensive capability. The unit braved unexpected enemy air raids and heavy artillery bombardment day and night. During their defense, the main force was able to advance towards Indin on the coast. The use of enemy car routes made it extremely advantageous for the Japanese army to employ mobile tactics. In this way, the enemy's attempt to attack was crushed on the banks of the Mayu River.</p>
<p>Significance of this Strategy</p>
<p>Originally, from a geographical point of view, it was extremely difficult to attack the Akyab area from the south because of the steep ridges and crisscrossing rivers, and land transport was extremely difficult. From the direction of Rangoon, it was almost an isolated island. On the other hand, from the direction of India, it was extremely convenient to advance because there were car routes. Moreover, there was an aviation force gathered at the Akyab airfield, and under its cover, it was not impossible to land on the Burmese coast and retake Burma. The enemy was constantly carrying out counteroffensives based on this judgment. This battle turned the enemy's attempt to retake Akyab into a dream. Moreover, the enemy troops attacking in this area in this battle were the British Indian Army's most elite 14th Division, plus another division. All were annihilated before the Japanese army's brave combat and indomitable spirit. This was a great blow to the enemy's combat strength. (Sho: From the Western Asahi Shimbun, April 9)</p>

<h3>The Commerce Control Association Requests Instructions on Six Issues for the Convenience of Work; Directors and Supervisors Telegraph the Ministry of Industry for Instructions to Follow; Handling of Materials Movement Permits Begins Today</h3>
<p>The National Association for the Control of Commerce, in order to facilitate its work, requires suggestions and instructions from the government. It held a meeting of directors and supervisors a few days ago and resolved on six key points for suggestions and instructions. A formal telegram has been prepared to request the Ministry of Industry to review and provide instructions for compliance. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Issue of Announcing Regulations on Major Commodities</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the "major commodities" mentioned in the Provisional Regulations for Industry and Commerce Associations, the detailed categories are said to have been largely determined. It is requested that they be announced as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Issue of Designating Organizations for Industry Associations</p>
<p>(2) It is requested that it be clearly stipulated which major commodities fall within the scope of control, so that industry associations can be organized separately by industry in accordance with the Association's Provisional Regulations and join the Association as members. Currently, the various industry associations are in the process of adjusting themselves in accordance with the Provisional Regulations for Industry and Commerce Associations, and they must wait until after the adjustments before they can join the industry associations as members. If the lower-level organizations are not completed, the Association will not be able to carry out its work of supervision, guidance, purchase, and allocation. It is requested that the Ministry quickly designate all industry associations that should be organized and complete the organization within this month, so that the Association's work can be promoted.</p>
<p>Issue of Procurement Quantity of Materials from Other Ports</p>
<p>(3) Before the establishment of the Association, most of the materials in various counties in other ports were issued permits by the local Japanese Liaison Officer and allocated and sold through the various China Branch allocation combinations or sales negotiation associations. These materials were mostly daily necessities such as soap, matches, candles, and cloth. Now, the various combinations have been ordered to stop working, so the counties have not been able to obtain allocations since March 15th, and they have been requesting relief. At present, the Association's lower-level organizations have not yet been fully organized. During this transitional period, may we be responsible for ordering the chambers of commerce in each county to submit applications for permits to the Association for verification and issuance, based on the quantity of allocated materials obtained in February, so that they can be approved to come to Shanghai to procure and transport them back for distribution to avoid causing panic? It is requested that this be approved. Furthermore, the baseline quantity for the export of various major items in April has been decided by the review committee to be temporarily based on the quantity in March. Now that it is late April, it is requested that the baseline quantity for export in May be decided within this month.</p>
<p>Issue of Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth Movement Permits</p>
<p>(4) It has been many days since cotton yarn and cotton cloth were ordered to be temporarily suspended from movement. Now, various manufacturers are complaining that raw materials are exhausted and are requesting that the registered yarn and cloth be approved for movement to avoid production stagnation and worker unemployment. What they say is indeed true. May we temporarily allow the industry associations to be responsible for providing proof, which is submitted to the agencies designated by the Ministry for review and approval, so that they can be approved for movement to facilitate production and alleviate the difficulties of merchants? Respectfully request instructions.</p>
<p>Issue of Free Movement of Specific Materials</p>
<p>(5) According to the regulations, specific materials can be moved freely within the Shanghai area and between the areas of the three provinces and two cities. Previously, because the laws and regulations were newly promulgated and the notification was not widespread, misunderstandings and obstructions were inevitable. A letter was submitted to the Ministry, and the Ministry replied that the Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau had been notified to handle it accordingly, and the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the French Municipal Council had also been notified to handle it accordingly. Recently, various industries have come to the Association to complain that various materials, regardless of whether they are controlled or not, are still being obstructed when moving them. This matter concerns the progress of the Association's work. Please reiterate the previous order and thoroughly notify the relevant parties to alleviate the difficulties of merchants and comply with the laws.</p>
<p>Issue of Overall Planning for Increased Cotton Production</p>
<p>The Association's work involves both the control of consumption and the increase in the production of materials. Issues such as increasing cotton production are of great importance to the adjustment of prices. Agricultural products are seasonal. If we do not proceed in a timely manner, we are afraid that the opportunity will be lost and we will have to wait another year, which will not only affect production but also affect prices. It is requested that the Ministry plan overall and approve the implementation as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Materials Movement Permits to Be Handled Directly from Today</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the National Association for the Control of Commerce, the two Shanghai offices of the Ministry of Industry were specially requested to take over and assist in handling matters related to materials movement permits. Now that the Association's administrative departments have been organized, it specially dispatched the heads of the audit section's movement group and the general affairs section's visa group yesterday to take over the work. All previous material movement application documents, permits, and other documents have been transferred by personnel from the Ministry of Industry's Shanghai office. Starting today, all matters related to applications for material movement permits will be the responsibility of the Association for the Control of Commerce.</p>
<h3>Tenth Round of Grain Distribution in the Urban Area; Mass Distribution to Begin Within Days</h3>
<p>Regarding the tenth round of grain distribution in the urban area, the Municipal Grain Bureau has completed the allocation based on the actual population in the Nanshi, Zhabei, Huxi, and Pudong districts, and has ordered the public rice distribution offices in each district to pay the fees and distribute the rice. This time, each person, regardless of age, will receive 2.5 liters of grain at a price of 7.5 yuan. Once the rice distribution procedures in each district are completed, the distribution will begin widely. Nanshi District began distribution yesterday. It is said that the rice in that district is whole grain and there is no mixing. The rice tickets for April have also been distributed by the Grain Bureau. However, citizens holding tickets to purchase rice must indicate the number of households in the Baojia system on the back of the rice ticket and have the household head affix a seal to prevent abuses and make the distribution of grain to factories more thorough.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul General Yano Makes a Statement: No Fear of Air Raids on Shanghai</h3>
<p>Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Yano Seiki, said when interviewed by the Continental New Daily yesterday: "From the fact that American pilots attempted to bomb the Japanese mainland on this day one year ago (April 18th) and failed to achieve anything, it can be seen that the American attempt to bomb Shanghai will surely fail." "On this day last year, I happened to be in Tokyo and witnessed American planes indiscriminately bombing schools and hospitals, and using machine guns to strafe fleeing university students. This was extremely inhumane. Compared with Japanese pilots who only bomb military targets with the lowest degree of shooting range, the way of heaven is cyclical, and the failure of American air raids on Shanghai is inevitable." "Citizens of Shanghai must be cautious in case of emergencies. When American planes attacked Tokyo, Japanese citizens had already made considerable preparations. However, in view of the good results of the past few air defense exercises, Shanghai citizens have nothing to fear from American air raids." Yano concluded that although this is the case, the citizens of Shanghai should continue to study air defense techniques, because terror and chaos are even more harmful than actual bombing.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Assists in Collecting Urban Area Land Tax</h3>
<p>After the Incident, land tax in the urban area was completely suspended. Later, when the National Government returned to the capital, all policies were put back on track and the administration was renewed daily. The Municipal Government considered land tax revenue to be a normal national tax revenue and had repeatedly and actively rectified and resumed collection. However, a small number of citizens were found to be unaware of the laws and attempted to evade taxes, which was not right. In order to effectively rectify the situation, the Municipal Government unanimously decided at the district administration meeting that the Municipal Police Bureau would dispatch police to assist in the collection of land tax in the future, in order to increase the national treasury and stop the practice of tax evasion. The Municipal Police Bureau has now received the government order and has immediately instructed the subordinate district branches to assist in order to strengthen the national treasury.</p>
<h3>Meat Stall Fined for Using Short Weights</h3>
<p>A notice from the Information Office of the Public Concession states: "Sun Xingcai, the meat stall vendor at No. 45 Xinzha English Field, was found to be using short weights in violation of regulations. After being discovered by the Bureau's Health Department on the 9th of this month, the court sentenced him to a fine of 300 yuan the next day, and the weighing instruments were confiscated as a warning."</p>
<h3>Reform of the Japanese Embassy in China Has Great Significance; To Adapt to the New Situation After the National Government's Entry into the War; Efforts to Promote Unification in the Economic Field</h3>
<p>After the Japanese government established the Greater East Asia Ministry last November, it transferred various agencies in China under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Asia Development Board to the Greater East Asia Ministry. The Japanese Ambassador was appointed to direct and supervise them. In addition to Nanjing as the main base, embassy offices were established in Beijing, Shanghai, Zhangjiakou, and other places, and plenipotentiary ministers were appointed to be responsible for them respectively. The various agencies that previously belonged to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Asia Development Board, including consulates general, consulates, and police stations, were also placed under their control. Thus, the unified organization has been established.</p>
<p>Previous Organization</p>
<p>As for the organization of the embassy offices, in addition to establishing a secretariat under the minister, five departments were established: General Affairs, Justice, Economy, Finance, and Culture. In order to adapt to the economic situation at the time, the financial affairs were further divided into general economic affairs, financial affairs, and fiscal affairs. The section chiefs of the various sections handling general economic affairs were staffed by active duty military personnel from the army and navy, so that they could directly handle the matters. The organization of the Japanese embassy office in Shanghai was the same as the above. However, due to the National Government's entry into the war and the progress of Sino-Japanese relations, the situation has changed greatly. At the same time, in order to adapt to this new situation, the organizations of the major embassy offices were reorganized on April 1st of this year.</p>
<p>New Organization</p>
<p>After this reorganization, the new organization only has a secretariat, a deliberation office, and three departments: General Affairs, Political Affairs, and Economy. Each department has various sections. For example, the General Affairs Department has four sections: General Affairs, Information, Investigation, Reporting, and Culture. The Political Affairs Department has three sections: Administration, Police Affairs, and Training. The Economy Department has six sections: Planning, Commerce and Industry, Agriculture and Forestry, Transportation, Finance, and Fiscal Affairs. The main goal of this reorganization is to seek simplicity and efficiency and to exert comprehensive functions.</p>
<p>Overview of the Reform</p>
<p>The main points are as follows: (1) The deliberation office, which previously belonged to the General Affairs Department and was directed by the director of the General Affairs Department, has been promoted to be directly under the minister and has become an auxiliary body to the minister, deliberating or planning various important policies. In other words, it is an auxiliary organ to the minister. (2) The various sections and offices in the embassy office that were directly staffed by active duty army and navy personnel have been abolished, and the active duty military personnel have been reassigned to the deliberation office and the planning office to deliberate on important policies and to be responsible for liaison with the military. (3) In the past, in addition to the deliberation office and the secretariat, there were five departments and fifteen sections: General Affairs, Justice, Economy, Finance, and Culture. After the reorganization, there are three departments and thirteen sections: General Affairs, Justice, and Economy. This can avoid the complexity of affairs and promote the activities of the entire organization, making it more rational. (4) The General Affairs Department has separate sections for information investigation and military reporting to avoid confusion between the affairs of the two sections in the past, and the organization of the former Culture Department has been reduced to a cultural section directly under the General Affairs Department. (5) The Economy Department has newly added a planning section to design ten plans for material movement, transaction transportation, capital labor, etc., to establish price countermeasures, the China Central Development Company's business, and other economic policies related to economic and financial affairs. (6) The Finance Department, which previously made great contributions to financial and currency policies in Central China, has been abolished and merged into the Economy Department. Therefore, the three sections of finance, fiscal affairs, and auditing in the former Finance Department have also been changed to two sections of finance and financial management and merged into the Economy Department. The former auditing department is also included in the new financial management section.</p>
<p>Significance of the Reform</p>
<p>At this point, we can clearly understand the significance of the reform of the embassy office's organization. Since China's entry into the war, the National Government has actively prepared the domestic war participation system, and in order to enhance its combat power, revive industry, and stabilize the people's livelihood, it has first sought to completely transform the free economy into a wartime planned economy. At present, a self-reliant control economic organization has been established, and the entire economic sector has been mobilized to actively promote it. When China entered the war, Japan declared the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality, and further eased the rules for the movement of materials in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and transferred the regulatory authorities to the National Government for self-management. In order to cooperate with the National Government in completing the unified currency policy in Central and Southern China with Central Reserve Bank notes, it resolutely abolished the issuance of new military notes. From this, it can be seen that the relationship between China and Japan has become closer, and they are moving together towards the common goal of completing the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, in order to adapt to this situation, the various Japanese agencies in China have reformed their past organizations. From another perspective, the abolition of active duty army and navy personnel serving as section chiefs in the major embassy offices and the trend towards unification of financial officers and economic and financial countermeasures in China by the Ministry of Finance are closely related to the strengthening of the National Government's political power and the success of its currency policy. From this, it can be seen that the reform of the Japanese embassy in China has great significance.</p>
<h3>Exhibition of Chairman's Calligraphy Sensation in the City</h3>
<p>The manuscript of Chairman's calligraphy "Stories of Old Friends" has been on public display in the art gallery on the fourth floor of the Great China Department Store since the day before yesterday, creating a sensation throughout the city. The number of visitors has been no less than 10,000 each day, mostly cultural figures and college and middle school students. They all stop to admire it, from beginning to end, not leaving a single word, and praising the fine letter and handwriting. The Great China Art Gallery is shoulder to shoulder, bustling with unprecedented excitement, setting a record. It is a pity that the exhibition period is limited and the whole city has not been able to enjoy it.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Epidemic Prevention Campaign; Health Division Specifies Injection Times</h3>
<p>A notice from the Municipal Council states: "From the 20th of this month, citizens can go to the epidemic prevention injection sites set up by the Bureau's various district health divisions or the Baojia authorities in each district to request free epidemic prevention injections and receive epidemic prevention certificates. The addresses of the various district health divisions are listed below:"</p>
<p>(Except Saturday afternoons, holidays, and Sundays)</p>
<h3>Provisional Income Tax Regulations; Rules for Imposing Penalties and Recoveries; Income Tax Payable by Companies and Firms Shall Not Be Declared by Accountants on Their Behalf</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Regional Collection Bureau of the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, in accordance with the provisions of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, shall settle income tax revenues for all industries once at the end of each year. Now that the 31st year has long ended, collection has begun, and the Ministry has issued orders to all industries to truthfully declare the amount of tax payable in order to increase national tax revenue. However, according to the regulations of the Ministry of Finance, the amount of income tax payable by companies and firms shall not be declared by accountants on their behalf, and the district bureaus shall not accept such declarations. Therefore, the bureau will absolutely refuse to accept the declaration by accountants entrusted by various companies and firms to uphold tax policy.</p>
<p>Reasons for Drafting</p>
<p>The declaration of various types of income tax is intended to discover those who make false or concealed statements, as well as taxpayers or those who withhold income tax who fail to pay taxes within the prescribed time limit. According to the provisional regulations, the competent collection agency may transfer the case to the court for punishment. In the past, the courts have not had a set of rules for handling cases that violate the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, and they have often been unable to impose penalties, which has had a significant impact on tax revenue. Minister Luo of the Ministry of Judicial Administration believes that income tax is the best tax system in the world and is suitable for the wartime financial system. Therefore, he drafted a draft of the rules for judicial organs to impose penalties and recover taxes in accordance with the amended Provisional Income Tax Regulations, which was approved by the Ministry of Finance and submitted to the 153rd meeting of the Executive Yuan for approval. After this, the income tax competent collection agency will be able to transfer cases of failure to pay taxes within the prescribed time limit to the court for trial, and the court will be able to impose penalties in accordance with the newly promulgated rules. If the taxes are still not paid by the deadline, the court will forcibly execute the recovery of the taxes and fines. When hearing lawsuits, if the court discovers cases of violation of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations or other income tax laws, it may also transfer the case to the income tax competent collection agency for verification of the tax amount and then impose penalties or recover the taxes separately in accordance with the regulations.

<p>The Public Concession Municipal Council Police Headquarters and the police personnel of each district will select the most elite members for a grand review to be held at the Racecourse at 2:00 p.m. on Friday. The review will be presided over by the Municipal Council Director-General Katsuo Okazaki. After the review, the Director-General will award various medals to all police personnel who have made contributions. At that time, Japanese military officers and officials from China, Germany, Italy, and France will be invited to participate. This kind of grand review is held once a year as a matter of routine. It was not held last year due to various reasons. Now that the Public Concession's police administration has been adjusted several times and has been completely renewed, this year's review is of great significance. The commands will be given in Japanese during the review. The police personnel in each district have been actively preparing and intensifying training in order to select outstanding personnel to participate in the review. In addition to regular Chinese, Japanese, and Indian detectives, there will also be special Japanese patrols, White Russian auxiliary teams, and reserve teams. The Ward Road Prison will also send personnel to participate.</p>
<h3>Central Police Station Detains Thief; Stolen Money Awaits Collection</h3>
<p>Chinese detective Tian Changyuan of the Central Police Station recently detained a thief named Lin Changkang in the concession and seized hundreds of yuan in stolen money. According to the confession, the money was stolen from the Bund area on the Fourth Road, but because the victim did not report it to the police station, it is hoped that the loser will report to the Central Police Station after seeing the report, explaining the amount of money and the circumstances of the theft. If it matches the facts, the money can be collected.</p>
<h3>Mr. Zhang Yipeng Spoke on "Citizen Welfare" Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Yipeng, a veteran of the judicial community, was invited to speak on "Citizen Welfare" at the Jing'an Temple Academic Weekly Lecture yesterday. More than 200 people from all walks of life attended. Abbot Migala delivered an introductory speech, and Mr. Zhang took the stage amid applause. The main points of his speech were as follows: "In recent years, I have been resting in Shanghai and have been urged by all sectors to assist in local undertakings and seek welfare for the citizens. This is my long-cherished wish. However, according to the general observation of Shanghai today, the so-called welfare is only the welfare of a part of the people. Therefore, the prosperity of Shanghai today is distorted, unreasonable, and does not conform to the ideals of the fragrant people. If we want the people to exert their strength and strive for common welfare, we must first rely on the sound local autonomous organizations and the elimination of bad customs, so that everyone has no concerns about their personal safety and property, the citizens are protected, each gets what they deserve, each lives in peace, and each enjoys their work. Last autumn, my colleagues felt the importance of their responsibility and concentrated local manpower to organize an association to study local reforms, and in the form of suggestions, to cooperate with the relevant parties to improve the people's lives, so that they would not suffer from disasters and be in line with the principles of citizen welfare. All sectors may make suggestions at any time. Shanghai is a part of China and also a part of Greater East Asia. Citizen welfare is extremely important." It is said that next week, Master Jizang, who has studied philosophy in India for six years, will speak on the Great Vehicle Accomplishment Theory. The public is welcome to attend the lecture.</p>

<p>Shanghai's weekly business interest rate fell from 20 cents to 18 cents. Various daily necessities maintained a weak trend. The industrial and commercial situation was unremarkable.</p>
<h3>Commentary: Japan's New Decision to Maintain Price Controls</h3>
<p>The issue of commodity prices has become a serious problem at present. Therefore, methods to resolve this issue have also become a pressing topic. Of course, tightening controls, improving rationing, punishing price gouging, thoroughly investigating hoarding, and so on, are all aimed at solving the problem of commodity prices. However, when it comes to commodity prices, it is better to focus on maintaining low prices beforehand than to exert effort on suppressing high prices afterwards. Looking around the world, Japan, our allied nation, has been most effective in maintaining a wartime low-price policy. It is said that after so many years of war, the extent of price increases in Japan is only about double the pre-war prices on average. Such an achievement is probably unsurpassable by any other country.</p>
<p>The other day (April 16), the Japanese Cabinet meeting again decided on the basic principle of maintaining low commodity prices. Its dual purpose is to stabilize people's lives on the one hand and increase wartime production on the other. Its main method is to pay higher prices for industrial products and apply lower prices to people's consumption. According to this method, when the government purchases industrial products, producers will receive a guaranteed standard price. In other words, the price they receive is sufficient to maintain manufacturing in terms of raw materials. At the same time, the prices that consumers should pay will be maintained at their current levels.</p>
<p>Such a basic principle of maintaining low commodity prices is truly worth learning from. Because the principle of commodity prices lies in stability, and the basic principle of stabilizing commodity prices lies in promoting production. Because after production increases, social materials will naturally not evolve into a situation where demand exceeds supply. Therefore, this column specifically proposed the point of factory cost accounting in the April 5th discussion on "Rationalized Commodity Price Issues," advocating not to let manufacturers suffer excessive losses, which also meant encouraging production to suppress commodity prices.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Trade Association: Strictly Supervising Member Business; Firms May Not Engage in Buying and Selling of Goods; Pawns Limited to Members of the Trade Association</h3>
<p>In order to assist in suppressing speculation and hoarding to curb commodity prices, the Silver and Money Trade Association has not only instructed member firms to carefully lend in accordance with the new method of restricting lending, but also in accordance with government laws and regulations: (1) Each firm shall not provide loans secured by goods to any individual or group other than members of the Trade Association. (2) Each firm shall not engage in the buying and selling of goods. (3) When each firm provides loans secured by goods, regardless of the amount, it must immediately report to the local competent authority for record. As for the pawns already made, the following items should be listed in detail and sent to the Silver and Money Trade Association for transfer to the local competent authority: (1) The name, occupation, and address of each borrower, as well as the name of the company or firm and the name of the representative. (2) Loan amount. (3) Loan period and expiration date. (4) The name and quantity of the secured goods, and the place of storage. (5) Whether there is an extension and whether there is a partial repayment. In addition, at the end of each month, a detailed list of loans secured by goods, divided into principal paid, unpaid, and transferred accounts, should be sent by the association to the competent authority. Violators will be investigated and dealt with according to law.</p>
<h3>Joint Associations of Various Industries: Organizational Principles and Functions</h3>
<p>In order to actively establish internal institutions, the Commercial Control Association is currently discussing the Joint Associations of Various Industries, and will complete its organization as soon as possible, so as to restore the normal transactions of various industries as soon as possible. According to reporters, the association has also stipulated the following three general principles of organization: (3) Trade associations related to raw material procurement. (2) Trade associations for manufacturing and processing. (3) Trade associations for product sales. The association has also determined the functions of the Joint Associations of Various Industries as follows: (1) Control and operation, (2) Procurement of raw materials, (3) Promotion of production, (4) Handling of industry allocation.</p>
<h3>After Free Transportation of Food, Rice Prices Plummet</h3>
<p>Since the authorities of the two concessions simultaneously revoked the prohibition of moving rice, flour, etc., and allowed free transportation, the people of this city have relaxed. Rice dealers have suffered a great blow, the frenzy of competitive purchases has completely subsided, and the black market of national rice has plummeted sharply. The general public is quite satisfied with the authorities' adoption of this measure.</p>
<h3>Strict Enforcement of Cigarette Price Limits in Urban Areas; List of Retailers, etc., Already Sent to Police Department</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the Huazhong Tobacco Allocation Association's reward and drag-delivery system, the trend of price increases and hoarding by various cigarette paper shops has been curbed. Although the initial delivery to various retailers has not been strictly followed, since the second phase of delivery began, the association has decided to strictly enforce it to rectify the situation. It is understood that in order to prevent various cigarette paper shops in the urban area from profiting for personal gain, the association has specially sent the retail prices and the list of various retail stores and wholesale cigarette merchants in the urban area to the Municipal Police Department to assist in enforcement, so that the cigarette black market can be quelled.</p>
<h3>Decision on Exchange of Goods Between Central and North China</h3>
<p>Due to the relationship between the Reserve Bank Notes and the United Reserve Bank Notes, the Central and North China regions have not been able to form a whole group economically, and the trade between the two has not been able to achieve ideal smoothness. The highest authorities believe that this phenomenon is detrimental to the development of the wartime economic system. In the future, they will try their best to open up the current situation so that materials between the two places can be smoothly exchanged. Therefore, Central China will supply North China with wheat, soybean cake, and food materials, while North China will compensate with coal and other materials. However, there is still a considerable surplus. As for the settlement method, it has also been discussed and decided that, based on the fundamental principle of material circulation, the imbalance in the exchange settlement this year will be allowed to exist. The settlement will use both Reserve Bank Notes and non-exchange methods. For important materials in the Reserve Bank Notes settlement part, half of the imbalanced amount will be used as the Reserve Bank's loan to North China as one of the settlement methods. Therefore, the leap in trade between Central and North China and the smooth flow of materials are expected.</p>

<h3>Views of Personnel Participating in the Commercial Control Association</h3>
<p>Candle</p>
<p>Only when the Chinese and Japanese business circles unite to organize lower-level institutions can the Commercial Control Association's control of materials fully exert its effect. The rational control of material procurement and allocation is the core of the problem, but how to achieve rationality still depends on the extent to which lower-level institutions are prepared.</p>
<p>Mr. Dike Youzang (candle industry), manager of Rongtai Foreign Firm, who was appointed as the preparatory director of the lower-level institutions, expressed his aspirations as follows when the lower-level institutions were established:</p>
<p>It is said that the authorities' policy is to first control commerce and then control industry. Therefore, the goal this time is how to establish lower-level institutions for procurement and allocation. In this context, the connection between China and Japan is the biggest problem. The good or bad of the connection between the two parties is enough to determine the success or failure.</p>
<p>To organize an allocation mechanism that integrates the Chinese and Japanese business circles, the first thing is to reorganize those scattered Chinese allocation mechanisms.</p>
<p>Second, how to connect with the Japanese allocation combination. Third, how to combine the unified allocation mechanism in the mainland and the allocation mechanism in the Shanghai area. If the above problems are solved perfectly, then materials can flow smoothly.</p>
<p>For example, in the current Shanghai candle manufacturing industry, the Japanese side has Japan Oil and Fat, Izumitsu, Fukuju, and Shanghai Oil and Fat, in addition to the four major factories of Japan Oil and Fat (military management factory). The Chinese side has 28 companies. The total production capacity of the Chinese and Japanese sides is 000. However, most of the Chinese side is family-style industry, with only 60 roots of production capacity for one machine. Each family has as many as five or six machines. Not only is the manufacturing power not as good as the Japanese side, but the quality of the products is also very poor. The future problem is how to ratio the products of the Chinese and Japanese sides and what kind of allocation method to use for various places.</p>
<p>According to the past allocation methods, the products of the Chinese side were not controlled, only the products of the Japanese side were allocated to both the Chinese and Japanese sides.</p>
<p>It is said that the Chinese side is working on preparing for the establishment of a joint association in this direction, while the Japanese side is also engaged in this issue. When it is resolved, the two parties can truly unite. For example, setting up a Chinese-Japanese consultation meeting is also a way. Regarding control matters, Shanghai and the mainland must be unified in any case. Regarding this point, I intend to fully exchange opinions with the Chinese side. In short, it is an urgent task to connect the advantages of China and the advantages of Japan and use its mechanism. (Continental New Report, April 15)</p>

<h3>A Few Words on Success and Failure</h3>
<p>— Hu Li</p>
<p>The theory and facts about the two words "success and failure" are well-rehearsed by most people, not to mention the historical evidence since ancient times. As usual, it is best to hide one's clumsiness to avoid making a fool of oneself. But recently, I encountered a matter that could go either way, and I am a little confused. I would like to ask the wise to give me an answer; I just want to vent my melancholy without a way out.</p>
<p>The matter started with buying leather shoes: Buying a pair of leather shoes is naturally not something that ordinary honest salaried people can easily afford. I set a plan to deduct 60 yuan per month from the two items of "regulating the body and mind" and "reducing fat," so wouldn't I get my wish in six months? It is true that "planning is up to people," and I followed the rules for two months, accumulating 120 yuan. I thought I would visit the "footwear" displayed in the window, which looked quite impressive. Thinking that in another 100 days, I would be the owner, I felt a little proud, and my body floated up. Unexpectedly, when I went to take a look, the "footwear" was fine, but its value had increased after two months of "living abroad." It was true that "three days apart, one should look at each other with new eyes," let alone two months; I gasped and turned back. So my plan of accumulating 60 yuan per month was successful, but buying that pair of leather shoes was a failure. Speaking of the two words "success and failure," they are opposites, but could they also be two sides of the same coin, or perhaps the two personalities of a hypocrite? If I compromised and sought a second-best option, it would still be a pair of leather shoes, but would I be worthy of my two months of hardship?</p>
<p>So the feeling came. Xiang Yu couldn't defeat Liu Bang and blamed it on "not the crime of war." Looking at my failure to buy leather shoes, it is the same, with no distinction. However, Xiang Yu is still praised as a hero in historians' comments, getting the partial but not the correct. Regardless of whether Xiang Yu at the time wanted the word "hero" and committed suicide by the Wujiang River, ordinary people think that Xiang Yu may have understood that the general situation was gone and was unwilling to be a "loser is a bandit" and make a fool of himself. Although he committed suicide, he was unwilling, but someone comforted him after his death, so he could rest in peace. In my case, I am neither willing to get the partial, let alone the correct. I am just angry and cut off my sleeves. I am afraid that some people will say that I am afraid of buying a second-best option and becoming an insignificant general and cut off relations with him. Then let me praise myself with another name, but unfortunately there is no suitable one, let it be "Clerk Dian." If you want to ask me what deep meaning it contains, to be honest, I removed the head and tail from the title of the famous "Biography of Clerk Yan," Dian is a minor official not as good as a general, but at first glance, it seems to be the role of the pawnbroker.</p>
<p>While I was angry about the leather shoes, a friend came to enlighten me: "Now everything is rising in price day and night. Not buying it at the time caused today's troubles. I advise you to endure the pain and buy it today, maybe it will go up again tomorrow." I was moved, but the key to success or failure came again. If I had two hundred sheets of white newspaper or some quinine or something else, even if I had succeeded in buying the leather shoes in two months but failed on the leather shoes, I could still break even.</p>
<p>Although I was depressed, I didn't forget to fight, so I still cut expenses—like us who lack the ability to increase revenue. Therefore, I was willing to use the horsepower of 60 yuan per month to fight against the two months. My heart seemed to have more than enough, but I always felt that my strength was insufficient, only the heaven and earth seemed a little smaller.</p>
<p>That friend said again: "Why have you been so thin lately?"</p>
<p>I replied: "I'm running a marathon!"</p>
<p>"Why are you running a marathon for no reason? You're really a little crazy."</p>
<p>"Ha, crazy."</p>
<p>I told him about the 60 yuan and 150 yuan thing. As a result, he said, "You're dreaming." After speaking, he left in a dismissive manner.</p>
<p>Madness plus dreaming, naturally not successful and must be hopeless? Saying that is absolutely appropriate is not very reasonable: Being a civilized person, struggling in worries day and night, doesn't it deeply coincide with Mencius's words that "born in worry and die in ease," he already received the half sentence of dying in ease, which seems to contain some successful meaning, otherwise he would become a passive suicide or a person who shaves his head and wears a cassock and relies on the Three Treasures. The saint, the time, he certainly doesn't refer to this character, then my worry is blessed. In this way, as for the speculator, I hope they can live a year longer, because I have to wait for my "success." But the general citizens (of course, I also have a share) are verbally cursing them, wishing to skin them, eat their flesh, and drink their blood and be satisfied, and I don't know if it is because the meat price is expensive and there is less oil and they are born as fat as pigs, or if they are like me because they can't buy leather shoes and wrongly accuse them of being as treacherous as snakes! I can write, but I read a passage in Zhu Xi's Quotations: "Although literati may not be able to do it, they can speak and write, enough to move people to hear, mostly leading to failure." Because I am waiting to be successful, if I chatter and write nonsense, it is to avoid failure. Alas, this world.</p>
<p>I thought about writing their success stories of getting rich, but I don't have the power to print them and publish them to the world. Thinking about it, I will ultimately sink and float in worries more often, and it is better to be at ease in the crowd than to be dispatched by a few people. Pain is indeed inevitable, but the feeling of comfort in the bones is thicker, and it seems to be a little helpful. Therefore, I, who used to suffer from insomnia, am now like Ah Q, who gained a spiritual victory and got a good night's sleep.</p>
<p>Isn't there some success, just worth a smile?</p>
<h3>My Long Gown</h3>
<p>— Hui Ren</p>
<p>Thin smoke curls and floats into the sky, one circle, then another.</p>
<p>My only long gown is gradually turning bluish-gray; it's aging. There's a tear on the left corner, and a tear on the right corner; soon, holes will cover my prized possession. They've found many companions and are happily settling down. I hurriedly consulted a "surgeon" for clothes, asking for a way to expel them. Who knew, the doctor shook her head: "Too late!" She lightly refused. Disheartened, I immediately took it off in anger. My short jacket was exposed—ah, even worse, even more holes where the parasites could live, unfit to be seen! Helpless, I put it back on and waited quietly for a new long gown to replace it.</p>
<p>I pondered and planned, wanting to accumulate some of the human world's demons—money. I disregarded morning and night, I disregarded illness, racking my brains and sweating, shaking my pen, dropping more black ink, row upon row, dot upon dot, on the white paper; heaven favored people's wishes, and I actually caught more demons. The old gown was also filled with joy, about to produce a replacement. I raised my head and stepped into the hometown of long gowns, wanting to hunt for a beloved one. The old gown widened its eyes, completely stunned; its kind had clearly risen in price, risen to the clouds. It regretted leaving home too early, and I measured the demons; I couldn't find an equivalent on the price tags with undried ink. I accompanied it in disappointment back to the asphalt road. My long gown remains a circle, then another circle. (Remuneration transferred to scholarship)</p>
<h3>On Yu Xi's Poetry</h3>
<p>— Shen Ji</p>
<p>In the collection of Yu Xi, two distinct moods can be seen. One belongs to a secluded soul, and the other is the resentment caused by a troubled and wandering life. Of course, only the former represents the clear sound of the poet's dreams, because all passionate sounds are harmful to crystal-clear poetic sentiments. However, this sentence is not appropriate for all poets. For example, if it were not for the decline and hardship of the world, I don't think Du Fu would have surpassed a loyal good citizen or a small official. Because Du Fu had no ambition, only loyalty; no deep following of direct response to nature, only a sincere tendency towards good politics. Such a person, in a better environment, would at most show a silent, pleasant smile. Li Shangyin is not like this. We only need to look at a few of his poems to see that he completely lacks that kind of rustic sincerity and humor. Like all "imperfect" geniuses, his heart is full of desires and a kind of inexplicable sadness. We can say that even if he created a world for himself, he would not be able to deal with it without regret. His existence seems to be not for life but for imagination. His tender, child-like emotions, of course, cannot be born in a cruel world. So, like all geniuses without the ability to practice, he entrusts his entire soul to poetry. He has a power to see through the mundane world, seeking beautiful things in the world—things that are not absent in the world, but too few people know how to seek them out. Furthermore, this kind of exploration must first have a kind of self-generated, incomprehensible "melancholy of the heart," because true beauty must become great through this thing. For example, these most beautiful lines of poetry, which one is not deeply stained with "melancholy of the heart"?</p>
<p>Flowers bright and willows dark, grief surrounds the sky,</p>
<p>Having ascended all the city walls, I climb higher still,</p>
<p>Wishing to ask the lone goose where it is going,</p>
<p>I do not know my own fate is adrift.</p>
<p>Heaven cherishes the hidden grass,</p>
<p>The human world values the late clearing. (Late Clearing)</p>
<p>In the red tower, separated by rain, we look at each other coldly,</p>
<p>With jeweled blinds fluttering, I return home alone with the lantern. (Spring Rain)</p>
<p>I do not refuse the title of envious of youthful beauty,</p>
<p>But I pity the flowing dust darkening the candle chamber,</p>
<p>Last night, the west pond was full of cool dew,</p>
<p>The sweet osmanthus blew away the fragrance in the moonlight. (Last Night)</p>
<p>This is not only beauty, but also a feminine delicacy, an excessively gentle emotion with its inevitable regret. This is Li Shangyin's first mood. In fact, he himself felt this kind of thing. He said:</p>
<p>I use clouds to add lines in the morning,</p>
<p>I command snow to compose poems in the cold,</p>
<p>Good times are mostly self-felt,</p>
<p>Are all writers like this...? (Occasional Sentiments)</p>
<p>How could a thoughtful person like him not understand himself? He had deeply realized that he was and always would be a person troubled by thought and haggard for beauty, but in this endless trouble, he was not absolutely without joy. Looking at the following two poems, we can see that on the one hand, he has reached the moment of extreme fatigue, but at the same time he can also be happy; and this kind of joy simply overflows from the soul.</p>
<p>Day by day, the spring light struggles with the sun,</p>
<p>On the mountain city's sloping road, apricot blossoms smell fragrant.</p>
<p>When will my mind be completely free of cares,</p>
<p>To be able to be like a silk thread a hundred feet long.</p>
<p>Dense locks of vermilion door hide green moss,</p>
<p>Deep halls and winding pavilions cause me to pace back and forth.</p>
<p>I first know that the wind rises and the moon contains a halo,</p>
<p>Still the dew is cold and the flowers are not yet open.</p>
<p>Bats disturb the pipes and reeds, endlessly tossing and turning,</p>
<p>Rats overturn the window screens, with little feeling.</p>
<p>Alone in the backyard, I share the remaining incense in the first month. (Dwelling at the Chong Rang Mansion)</p>
<p>Happy, he almost murmured a smile to himself, but except for this time, he rarely rejoiced again. He cannot wait forever in this secluded mansion. His ambition led him to run into the world, but in the world, he was forever disappointed.</p>
<p>Speaking of his ambition, and the other mood produced by this kind of ambition, I just want to say a few simple words. Li Shangyin was a person with great ambition, and this ambition was almost exaggerated, completely incompatible with his gentle character. For example, in his youth, he had such ambition, "Forever remembering the rivers and lakes, grieving over white hair, wanting to turn the world upside down into a small boat," but his era was chaotic, and his fate was particularly setback. After many years of struggle and ups and downs, he lamented, "How can I share the task of rectifying the country, which is not in line with my long-held aspirations." This is really pitiful. He felt that his entire life was being lost in mistakes. He was always in a big dream without getting to live. He said, "I am worried that I have a dream like a big dream, and I am even more worried when I expect you not to come." This is true. It is simply impossible for a thoughtful person to formulate a true life and want to achieve it. He will never succeed, just as Yeats said, "You were born for something more difficult than success."</p>
<h3>The Human World</h3>
<p>— Mu Zhi</p>
<p>A gloomy night,</p>
<p>Meditating in a daze.</p>
<p>Fine threads of rain floated in through the small window;</p>
<p>Soaking my hair;</p>
<p>Soaking my cheeks.</p>
<p>I woke up with a start,</p>
<p>Far away, a night owl was wailing.</p>
<p>The pitch-black surroundings were like a desolate graveyard.</p>
<p>Summoning up courage, I shouted wildly.</p>
<p>——No echo.</p>
<p>Opening my eyes, searching for a ray of light,</p>
<p>The moon was devoured by dark clouds,</p>
<p>Not a single star either.</p>
<p>The cold wind stood my hair on end,</p>
<p>The fine rain soaked my entire body.</p>
<p>A burst of sorrow surged from the bottom of my heart,</p>
<p>Owl's cry, wind, rain, sobbing;</p>
<p>Playing Tchaikovsky's "Pathétique Symphony."</p>
<h3>The Old Cobbler and His Wife</h3>
<p>— Wen Fan</p>
<p>In the kitchen shed downstairs from us lives an old cobbler, a skinny little man in his fifties, hunched over like a shrimp, hardly able to lift his head. His face is covered in wrinkles, like a jumble of knots. But his complexion is red, that murky, pig's-blood kind of color...</p>
<p>He has no children, only a wife who is about the same age as him. He contemptuously calls her "the old woman." She is half a head taller than him, but her face is pale and just as wrinkled, making her look even older than her husband.</p>
<p>The old cobbler is very amiable outside, not much of a talker, but always smiling; as if he has immense joy. The maids and poor housewives also like him; his shoes are sturdy, and his prices are cheap. But at home, his temperament becomes very volatile, and he is often heard cursing his wife, sometimes even hitting her, holding her head down and pounding her skull as if hammering a nail.</p>
<p>"You old hag, I'll beat you to death... I wish I could..."</p>
<p>His wife, however, is as meek as a lamb, silently enduring his insults and beatings. She never fights back. At most, she sobs quietly, muttering a complaint:</p>
<p>"Sins from a past life... sins..."</p>
<p>One evening, I was washing shoes at the tap when I saw the old cobbler drinking at the table. His wife, having finished eating, sat opposite him, taking apart old shoes, only occasionally glancing at him. The old cobbler glared, angrily cursing:</p>
<p>"You old hag, what are you looking at me for?... Are you wishing I would die sooner? Say it, you old hag..."</p>
<p>His wife cried out, wronged:</p>
<p>"Truly, sins from a past life, when did I ever curse you?... I was seeing if you had finished your wine, the rice is getting cold... Truly, sins..."</p>
<p>The old cobbler's anger had not subsided. He took a sip of wine and glared at her fiercely; until he had finished the last drop. Suddenly, he shouted angrily again:</p>
<p>"What are you doing, trying to starve me to death?... Not even serving me rice?... Good, you're asking for it..."</p>
<p>His wife, startled, stood up to serve him rice, still explaining softly:</p>
<p>"I was dazed... a damned knot... Truly, sins..."</p>
<p>Even after the lights were turned off and they had probably crawled into bed, one could still hear the old cobbler's murky, delirium-like voice:</p>
<p>"Why won't you die, you old hag! Just looking at you makes me seethe with anger..."</p>
<p>Then, one evening, after dinner, the air was quiet, and suddenly, the old cobbler's angry voice erupted again:</p>
<p>"Beast! Old hag... I... I'll beat..."</p>
<p>The kitchen shed suddenly seemed to be in an uproar: the tables, benches, and metal nails, awls, clashing in a chaotic mess. The old cobbler gasped madly, shouting:</p>
<p>"You old hag, you want to murder me... I'll kill you first!"</p>
<p>The whole house and the back alley were in an uproar. Everyone crowded around his door, only to see the old cobbler grabbing his wife's hair with one hand and pounding her head with his fist with the other, striking her fiercely. His wife sobbed, waving her hands feebly. Her overly long body was bent over in a terrible way, her face was ashen, and blood was flowing from her mouth.</p>
<p>Several people went forward and pulled them apart. The old cobbler, seeing us, relaxed. He smiled sheepishly and held out his left hand, with a wound on his thumb, bleeding.</p>
<p>"Look, gentlemen,... the shoes she took apart still had nails left in the heel,... isn't she deliberately trying to kill me?... This old hag, look at how vicious she is..."</p>
<p>His wife sat on the ground sobbing, wiping the blood from the corner of her mouth with her sleeve, defending herself:</p>
<p>"Truly sins, you say I did it on purpose... I just had a moment of blurred vision, I didn't see clearly... Truly..."</p>
<p>The old cobbler glanced at her again, but he didn't explode for quite some time. He smiled at us sheepishly again.</p>
<p>"Hehe... Look, gentlemen, where in the world could you find an old woman like this?... What is she like? Just a few slaps and she cries like this, hehe,... I'll tell you gentlemen, before, when my master beat my thumb to a pulp, I didn't dare even make a sound..."</p>
<p>After everyone had left, the old cobbler closed the door, and we heard his murderous voice again:</p>
<p>"You old hag, you want to harm me, fine... One day, I'll kill you..."</p>
<p>A few days later, his wife fell ill. At first, we still heard her low moans as she got up to empty the chamber pot and light the coal stove, but eventually, she couldn't get up anymore. As soon as the old cobbler left, she started moaning loudly... but the old cobbler still had his old temper, scolding at every turn:</p>
<p>"You're pretending to be dead to show me, are you?... You old hag, you're tormenting me... I have to work and cook for myself..."</p>
<p>His wife moaned softly, saying with difficulty:</p>
<p>"Sins from a past life... feel my forehead..."</p>
<p>That day, on a gloomy winter morning, the old cobbler got up early to light the coal stove. He was probably struggling with the coal fumes and started cursing fiercely again.</p>
<p>"Why won't you die, you old hag... You're tormenting me..."</p>
<p>After a while, suddenly, the old cobbler's desperate cry was heard:</p>
<p>"Ah, old woman;... what's wrong?... Ah, old woman is dead..."</p>
<p>He ran madly to the platform by the tap, calling out hoarsely:</p>
<p>"Old woman is dying... Ah, old woman, what's wrong..."</p>
<p>He ran back in and shook the old woman's increasingly stiff body violently; the planks creaked as if they were about to break. We stood far away at the door, afraid to run in: we only heard the old cobbler stamping his feet madly, his face covered in tears and snot, still shaking her.</p>
<p>"Old woman, you... ah, why did you have to die..."</p>
<p>The next day, several people came to carry the body away. The old cobbler first shed silent tears, but as soon as the body was carried away, he suddenly threw himself on the empty planks, howling like a wolf. Sometimes he pulled his own hair, sometimes he tore at his cotton-padded jacket with all his might, howling:</p>
<p>"Old woman, it's my fault... I tormented you to death... Why? I ruined my heart and liver with drinking... I have no heart..."</p>
<p>The old cobbler didn't go to work, nor did he eat. He didn't sleep at night either. All day long, his eyes stared blankly like a dead man's, then suddenly burst into piercingly mournful cries... No one dared to approach him.</p>
<p>A few days later, he packed up his simple luggage and moved away... No one knew where he went. Some said he went to the countryside, others said he was watching the alley somewhere, his face so thin that only his cheekbones remained...</p>
