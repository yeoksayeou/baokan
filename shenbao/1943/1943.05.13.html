<p>社評</p>
<h3>從張案說到改善警政</h3>
<p>張金海案已由法捕房撥款撫卹，並將肇事人員分別依照法律懲處，本案至此，已告一段落。我們對於此案，自始即認爲是法律事件，而非外交事件，是社會事件，而非政治事件。同時，我們特別指出，法捕房也應認淸這點，速將肇事人員處之於法，告罪於社會，而不致引起其他意外與不良的後果。今法捕房當局，能重視輿論，依法措置，尚屬差强人意。我們更誠摯盼望法捕房曁其他負有警務責任的機關，今後處置刑事案件，絕對遵循法律上正當途徑，尤其澈底廢除現代文明國家所不用的殘忍刑罰，使類似張案的不幸事件，不再重見於將來，豈僅社會之幸，抑亦警政機關與市民之間感情好轉之幸。</p>
<p>我們更因張案之觀感，對於上海區域之警政前途，備致殷切之期待。誠如昨評所論「政府與人民打成一片，警察乃爲促成這一工作的最適任者」。所以，我們於昨天討論和平區內警察制度之加强以外，今天專就上海警政，加以申論。</p>
<p>目前上海區域警政機關，計有公共租界警察本部，法租界巡捕房，以及上海特別市警察局等三個主體。就目前情勢而言，市民對於公共租界的警政期望最大。如果公共租界警政辦理良好，發生模範作用，那末，法租界與市區，也必能取法倣效，同趨完善了。</p>
<p>我們回溯公共租界警政的以往歷史，就是前年十二月八日以前，在英人控制時代。完全採用殖民地化的政策，對於市民，只知奴視與壓迫。可憐的印度人尤其是我國人之被僱傭者，初則强之以奴視我市民，壓迫我市民，繼而麻醉其思想，漸漸忘其本來面目，寖至依仗勢力，狐假虎威，於是市民畏之如蛇蠍，敬之如鬼神；於是形成彼此間的仇視與對立形勢。</p>
<p>自從大東亞戰爭發生後，公共租界的警政，即由友邦日本管理。我們知道日本國內的警政，向以辦理完善周密著稱於世。一年餘來，諸如保甲制度之確立，綁票盜刦案件之絕跡，這種事實，都足以證明管理進步的成績。可是，一般說來，因爲時間忽促，有待於繼續不斷加倍努力的改善之處尚多。我們本於知無不言，言無不盡之義，更作進一步之獻言如次：</p>
<p>（一）在根本上，應澈底變革英人殖民地化的警察政策。凡制度，規章，組織，行政等等，帶有殖民地化的奴役與壓迫市民色彩者，無論在精神上，實質上，必須一律肅淸，完全採取愛護市民，指導市民，密切合作的施策。這是最關重要的一着。</p>
<p>（二）過去英人僱用的白俄與印度警員，他們的思想，已被麻醉得深固不堪，我們盼望警政當局，對於這輩警員，加以特別的精神訓練，愼重派用，務必使之瞭解目前中日兩國有同甘共苦緊密協力的關係，再不是英人奴視壓迫的時代了。同時，盼望中國籍的警員，也應該自已醒覺，自重自愛其本身人格，而與市民親切融洽，誠實服務。</p>
<p>（三）過去警員深受英國奴化習慣，凡遇市民—包括各階層職業者居住者—稍一觸犯，並不用勸導方式先加指正，輙隨喜怒，任意頤使指氣。「自愛者，人必愛之。」我們看日本國內警察對待市民和靄可親的禮貌，不勝心折，亟盼當局嚴誡所屬，以「重禮貌」爲訓練警察的第一聲。</p>
<p>（四）對於巡捕及警員的薪水，我們主張必須提高，使之足以維持一身一家最低的生活。薪水不夠生活，無異獎勵作弊。所以，提高薪給，爲遏止一切弊端的基本因素。我們相信，每一市民願意支付最大代價，以供給辦理「好警政」的經費。盼望當局愼重考慮。</p>
<p>最後，我們更盼望民衆團體應以市民福利爲前提，設立機構，經常爲市民訴寃的顧問。我們曉得老百姓—也是鄉下人，縱使吃了虧，也不敢作聲，如能由民衆團體代爲告訴，是非得直，在警務當局，也必認爲這是民衆團體與當局的合作，而樂於接受處理。那末，行之日久，巡捕輕視市民的事件，必可逐漸减少，市民與警務機關的關係，必可逐漸密切。</p>

<h3>日軍當局公佈　佔領布其頓戰績　英軍在緬完全被逐爲期已不遠　南太平洋日機活躍澳異常恐懼</h3>
<p>仰光十二日中央社電　日軍各部隊前於印緬國境印典附近，擊滅英印敵軍中力後，復繼續擊敗敵北區挺進隊，征服溪流森林地帶，即於八日佔領馬西河之敵軍要衝布其頓，而粉碎敵方奪回緬甸之企圖，當時因日軍作戰巧妙，致敵軍極爲狼狽，趨入紛亂狀態。茲錄緬軍佔領布其頓之戰果如下，敵軍遺屍一千六百具，被俘一〇〇人，遣棄馬屍三〇〇具，日軍截獲及擊毀敵戰車牽引車十輛，大小砲四二門，卡車一八二輛，步槍二六八枝，擲彈機五架，自動步槍四六枝，輕機槍四九挺，手槍四技，有刺鐵絲網二十件，架橋材料多數，火藥數箱，各種砲彈三千七百五十發，步槍彈一萬九千六百發，手溜彈六百三十顆背圈三千個，毛毯三千條，及汽油等無算，又擊落敵戰鬥機一架，擊沉敵砲艇一艘，是役敵企圖重開滇緬公路之攻勢，業已全被粉碎云。</p>
<p>柏林十二日中央社電　德軍當局十一日發表談話，盛讚日軍在緬甸戰綫作戰功效，略謂緬甸戰綫，自英軍敗北後，戰事曾一度沈寂，日軍具有將英軍澈底遂出阿拉坎山脈之決意，而再度展開攻勢者，其時適當初入雨季，作戰頗感困難，此英軍認爲日軍或不能再事前進，而私自慶幸，但日軍於九日夜竟將馬酉河上流英軍主要陣地布其頓佔領，刻正繼續擴大戰果，此舉已澈底粉碎英軍之樂觀見解，日軍對英軍完全逐出緬境之期已在目前，一旦實現後，則日軍進攻印度之態勢，即已　　完成，因氣候關係，日軍於目前即展開印度作戰之可能性較少，惟就過去戰鬥而言，　日軍關於克服氣候上之惡劣條件，均較英軍爲優云。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城十二日中央社電　日軍航空部隊，因速日活躍於南太平洋，致使澳洲恐懼異常，茲據新金山來電，西南太平洋反軸心軍司令部發言人十日會見新聞記者時，會力言日軍之威脅已日益增大，略謂美政府方面，曾極力宣傳日軍在太平洋方面已損失大量船舶，已無餘力再施攻擊，但實際上並未見日軍感有船舶不足之情形云。又澳洲統一黨領袖休茲亦於十日夜作警告稱，若不能將日軍自南太平洋之佔領地內逐出，則不能免除澳洲之大脅，澳洲國民對當前之戰爭，雖已作相當之力，但尚未如前綫將士不顧犧牲之精神云。</p>
<p>里斯本十二日中央社電　據新金山來電西南太平洋反軸心軍司令部十一日發表如次，一，日航空部隊曾轟炸澳洲北部，並會於澳洲北岸洋上，襲擊反軸心護送船團，一，日航空部隊曾轟炸新幾內亞南部之反軸心軍根據地云。</p>
<p>里斯本十二日中央社電　據雪梨來電，澳洲陸相福特復，對正積極訓練密林戰鬬澳洲軍，講述此次戰爭之長期化及日軍之威脅，略謂，此次戰爭，自種種方面觀察，均可知將繼續相當期間。若日軍能得兩軍之時期，强化其陣地，則極難與日軍對抗。</p>
<p>里斯本十二日中央社電　墨爾缽來訊云，日本轟炸機，昨日襲擊達爾溫港東三百里之米林金比機塲。</p>
<p>里斯本十二日中央社電　墨爾缽消息云，達爾溫港以東之韋塞爾角區域，昨日曾遭日機襲擊，結果尚未經宣佈。</p>
<p>倍諾斯愛勒十二日中央社電　西南太乎洋反軸心軍總部頃宣布稱，日機一隊昨日突襲新幾內亞之米萊基地方。</p>
<h3>湘北等地日軍戰果</h3>
<p>漢口十二日中央社電　湖南前綫訊，日精銳部隊向渝第廿九軍展開猛烈掃蕩戰以來，該地區之日軍某報道班長十一日就此次作戰情况發表談話稱：此次洞庭湖之掃蕩戰中，我軍克服池沼湖澤之困難地帶，乃爲是役戰之特點。該地池沼綜錯，對於防守敵軍，更以數千之堤防爲陣地，予我軍不利地形，企圖强頑抵抗，然日軍竞　克服此大然　塞，突入渝軍第一綫之高家塲等堅固陣地，並以一日十八公里乃至二十公里之速度，向前進擊中。又於洞庭湖成　之後，又以陸上之猛烈砲火，於天心湖附近由敵後登陸，發揮日軍之極大威力。日軍自開始行動以來，僅六日之期間，佔領直達八十公里之廣大地帶，此實由於日軍之激昂戰時，神速所致。且我軍佔領安昌南縣後，將對長沙常德之敵據點，予以極大威脅。</p>
<p>京漢綫沿綫十二中央社電　日軍自於四月二十日展開冀西作戰後，即將盤踞於晋冀察省境共軍完全包圍，並在空陸雙方之協力猛攻下，將共軍及其軍事設施悉數擊破。茲該處戰事已於十一日完畢，計共與共軍交戰一三六次，共軍兵力一四四〇五人，遺屍一五三二具，被俘一一三二人。日軍並覆滅共軍事設施二七九處，截獲重輕機槍一四挺，迫擊砲一八門，擲彈機三一架，自動步槍八枝，步槍九三八技，手槍一八二枝，手溜彈一三一七三顆，地雷一四八一二〇發，無綫電信機五具，電話交換機二架，及其他彈藥軍糧被服等無算。</p>
<p>靑島十二中央社電　日軍對在山東靑島蠢動之渝共軍前曾屢决掃蕩，總計四月份中共與渝共軍交戰二八次，渝共軍兵力三一九九人，遺屍三六七具，被俘一二八人，日軍收獲擲彈筒，輕機槍步槍，及子彈手槍手溜彈被服等甚夥。</p>

<h3>日本船隻　並不感缺乏</h3>
<p>斯德哥爾摩十二日中央社電　據同盟社接墨爾缽消息，南太平洋麥克沃塞將軍總司令部，發言人今日談稱，日本商輪雖自珍珠港一役以來，不無損失，但並無表示其因在西南太平洋缺乏商輪噸位而感覺痛苦之徵象。數個月來，觀察所得，日本已在東之賴包爾，至西之蘇拉巴雅，集中大批船婆，又信日本在此區域內之商船隊，或其接濟廣大佔領區之能力，已因損失而大見减弱者，殊屬大錯。查自開戰以來，日方所俘獲之運輸船約計四七五，〇〇〇噸，而其國內新建者，估計亦在四五〇，〇〇〇噸之譜，上述各區域內，因實易已漸告恢復，對於船隻噸位之需求，日見增加，惟並無徵象可表示船隻不敷，致日本實行計畫受其阻礙云。</p>
<h3>朝鮮將實施　陸海志願兵制</h3>

<h3>守馬阿安半島德義軍　展開激烈防禦戰　英軍進攻義第一軍陣地　已遭軸心奮勇抵抗擊退</h3>
<p>里斯本十二日中央社電　　據北非消息，軸心軍曾據守馬阿安半島對自西北及西方來擊之反軸心軍機械化部隊，展開熾烈之防禦戰，然因兵力武器懸殊，不得已乃漸次後退，英第一軍十日自突尼斯東南之哈瑪姆里夫開始進攻後，復增援新銳坦克車部隊而壓迫軸心軍，當日即進達該地東方九哩之索里旦，然經軸心軍破壞其坦克車十八輛後，聞已退至後方陣地，十一日反軸心軍又自索里曼分兩路進攻，一路向東進達馬阿安半島中部之曼茲爾布薩爾，另一路目下進達索里曼南方七哩之格龍巴利亞，又據阿爾及爾方面消息稱，英軍一部隊十一日晨突入惠維達維爾北方二十五哩之哈馬美港，然軸心軍方面對此尚未承認。十一日德軍當局除稱，反軸心軍及入馬阿安半島西部地區外，其他均避免說明。軸心方面消息，仍報道稱，納格擇地區之軸心軍，仍繼續抵抗云。</p>
<p>羅馬十二日中央社電　義軍司令部十一日正午發表戰况如次，一英軍於突尼西亞戰綫，會反復進攻義第一軍團陣地，惟經軸心軍之奮勇抵抗，已被擊退，同時軸心軍猛攻敵後方之結果，已奪回被敵佔領之各有利地點，一突尼西亞東甫部地區敵步兵及坦克車部隊，與軸心軍激戰後，已抵馬阿安半島東南海岸，一我空軍會長驅直襲阿爾及爾及加勃斯兩港，重創敵港灣設施。</p>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電　海通社軍事評論員色托留斯上尉，本日宣戰，德義軍隊，現仍在蓬角牛島抗戰，反軸心軍於佔領突尼斯之後，立即以爲以其所有之部隊，於數小時內，即可征服其餘之軸心軍，但反軸心軍高級指揮部，關於此點，實不錯誤，軸心軍雖自始即自知無多大機會，但仍繼續抗戰，於星期六及星期日擊退反軸心軍之攻擊，因此反軸心軍高級指揮，乃不得不增派坦克車及步兵隊，並以大砲及飛機協助，以有系統之方法，準備再事攻擊，敵軍因大爲優越，故於星期一深入哈曼里夫東南之軸心陣綫，於星期一晚，即經由索里曼向半島東南海岸之哈瑪美登進攻，截斷在柴格霍安之事及東北山嶺中抗戰之軸心軍，與在蓬角半島抵抗之軸心軍間之聯絡，此兩部份之軸心軍，現已彼此隔絕，仍然繼續抗戰，但反軸心海空軍已完成對該半島之封鎖，使其絕不能獲得供　，因此軸心軍不久必將彈藥竭盡，自突尼斯及比塞大陷落之後，反軸心軍之征服突境殘餘之軸心軍，實已不成爲作戰上之問題，就戰術上言之，反軸心軍，亦無重大之任務可爲云。</p>
<h3>羅美爾元帥　已返德養疴</h3>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電　德元首總部本日宜告，自三月間突尼西亞軸心軍抵達加勃斯新陣地後，北非德軍團司令羅美爾元帥，即因健康不佳，已返德國。同時又據透露，羅氏巳獲得德國最高級軍功獎章，羅氏現正在恢復健康之中，俟渠復文後，渠又將被委一新任命云，據高級指揮部所發補充宜告之文告稱，羅氏因久居非洲，致疾病時發，該文告稱，「當一九四二年十月間，英軍開始向埃爾阿拉眠陣地，作大規模攻擊時，羅美爾元帥，係在德國，久居非洲，對羅氏之健康，大有損害，故屢經稽延之醫藥洽療，至此乃不能再免，但羅氏一聞英軍進攻之消息，即不顧醫師之勸告，立即停止醫治，返至非洲，渠原定暫時留非，但自英美軍在法屬北非登陸後，渠即延長其留非期間，羅氏受極爲優越之敵軍不斷攻擊，率領所部，退至突尼西亞，開歷史上迴避戰之例，其後羅氏之健康，日趨惡劣，故元首與義相協商之後，即爲軸心軍抵達加勃斯陣地之後，決定召羅氏立即返德，俾得迅速恢復健康，一九四三年三月十一日，羅氏即至元首總部報到，並受領勳章。羅氏之健康，現正恢復，俟渠完全恢復後，元首又將新任務相委」云。</p>
<h3>美軍傷亡人數</h3>
<p>里期本十一日中央社電　據華盛頓本日官方宣告，美國之戰時傷亡者，現時共計八〇，六六〇人，其中一二九六四人已死，三八一六九人失蹤，一六二〇〇人受傷，一三三二七人被俘，陸軍傷亡總數爲五五七二九人，其中五七七〇人陣亡，二五三三人受傷，二五〇九九人失蹤，一三三二七人被俘，陣亡者之中有四六九名爲菲列賓斥堠隊，受傷者之中有七四七人係菲列賓斥堠隊者，此外被俘者亦有一一八五五人爲該隊隊員，海軍之傷亡，計陸戰隊及海岸警衛隊陣亡七一九四人，受傷者四六六九人。失蹤者一三〇六八人。</p>
<h3>美海長主張　佔領西西半島</h3>
<p>斯德哥爾摩十一日中央社電　據華盛頓消息，美海軍部長諾克斯力言，必須佔領西西里，以保障反軸心對於地中海之控制，並以之爲對歐漩登陸作戰之出發點，諾氏在其例常招待報界席上稱，西西里在軸心手中，足以威脅反軸心在地中海之安全。渠力言反軸心經如有一由地中海而至近東之水路則甚有利，但如軸心飛機存在則將專事困擾反軸心此項次道云。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾渡美　與羅斯福會商　將討論第二戰塲開闢問題</h3>
<p>里斯本十一日中央社電　據此間接獲華盛頓官方宣布，邱吉爾首相本日下午三時十五分抵達華盛頓，與羅斯福總統會商，同來者有海陸軍專家多人。關於談話之性質，官方雖嚴守秘密，但華盛頓報界相信，彼等將討論在歐洲大陸開闢新戰塲之計劃。今日下午之宣告，已證實前數日間華盛頓及倫敦方面之傳說，邱吉爾首相未曾在英京漏臉，已歷一星期有餘，渠往時常親自向下議院報告戰事之結果，但此次關於北非戰事之報告，則係由副首相阿特里向下院提出，一說曾傳羅邱或將在開羅與史太林會議，但大致或發生阻碍，故中英美兩政府之領袖舉行會議。路透社特派員稱，並無明確之象徵可表明，史太林或將參加華盛頓之會議，或甚至曾被邀參加，但關於會議之進展情形，史太林與蔣介石兩人，將被通知，一如在加薩勃期加會議之時。</p>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　此間觀察家頃就羅邱會談事發表見解，謂「英首相邱吉爾此决偕軍界首腦於十一日往訪華盛頓，繼加港會談後舉行第四次之羅邱會談，遂即引起一般之關注，當上决加港會談時，英美各通訊社於事前均堅持沉默，但此次則大肆宣傳，多方臆測會談內容，或爲即將展開第二戰綫，但關於其眞相則毫未霄明，因而對此事於此時予以批評，實感尚早，但邱吉爾於議會中，曾謂此次訪美主要目的，在向羅斯視慶賀北非作戰之功，此言或爲事實，至於突尼西亞戰局現况是否可信爲已告眞正成功，及彼等已吾考慮今後能否展開歐洲登陸作戰，姑置別論，但彼等　圖藉此機會大肆宣傳，已獲重大轉機，藉以吸引其本國國民，並威脅中立國家，殆無疑義，其所以先期擴大宣傳者，亦正在此。彼等此次由於法軍預定行動，始得有所謂北非戰勝，因此於此次會議中討論次期作戰計劃時，或將妄測可轉變歐洲及東亞之戰局，此誠痴人說夢，蓋展開歐洲登陸作戰在事實上絕不可能，英美作戰首腦當局對此，亦早有所知，故此次會談，共主要目的仍在從事宣傳，而其結果必將與加港會談相同，一無實效也。」</p>
<p>斯德哥爾摩十二日中央社電　美報駐華盛頓特派員電稱，英相邱吉爾將於會晤羅斯福總統後，再與史太林晤談，羅總統建議以華盛頓爲會晤地點，因其頗以旅行爲苦也。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城十二日中央社電　英首相邱吉爾，此次偕陸海空軍首腦抵華盛頓後，合衆社及路透社即頻傳關於會議之重要性，謂此次會談中，或將協議關於結成第二戰綫問題云，合衆社鑒於上决加港會談中決定之歐洲重點主義，曾引起渝方及澳政府之非難，故在報道中謂，此次會談，對於太平洋上反攻作戰之問題，或亦將加以檢討，路透社則指出，史丹林委員長似無誠意參加此次會談，謂史丹林委員長能否參加此次華盛頓會談，及此次會談曾否邀請渠出席參加，俱無所知，但或將仍與加港會談相同，將此次會談經過通知渠及渝蔣云。</p>
<h3>對佛朗哥和平建議　德聲明毫不關心　決與盟邦提携爭取勝利</h3>
<p>柏林十二日中央社電　德政府當局，十一日就西總統佛朗哥倡議和平事表明意見，大意謂，（一）大戰勃發迄已三年有半，中立國方面於此時倡議和平，雖或有必要，但德政府不論突尼西亞戰局潰變如何，決與盟邦各國相提携，向爭取勝利之途邁進，絕不妥協，對於和平，毫不關心。（一）美國務卿赫爾及英外相艾登，拒絕佛朗哥總統之提案，雖屬當然，朗哥總統之提案，雖蜃當然，但預料全世界即將展開重大決戰，且當茲整備進行重大決戰之一切準備時以決戰決定勝敗之誰屬之問題，自較能否以和平避免決戰之問題，尤堪重視。（一）德國國民雖知決戰並非易事，但敵方陣營，亦必具同感。反軸心陣營若以增產相誇，則德政府亦可明告彼等，吾人軍需生產，最近已增加數倍之事實。（一）若就政治方面而言，則反軸心陣營蘇波糾紛及基他軋鑠，刻正層出不窮，反之軸心方面，因希特勒總統近與盟邦各國代表協議之結果，業已完成關於決戰之一切準備，至於決戰時將採取何等方式，及其動向如何，雖僅有極少數較總統親信知悉，但終將予世界戰局以決定性之影響云。</p>
<h3>戈林赴羅馬　會晤義首相</h3>
<p>里斯本十二日中央社電　據路透社傳莫斯科廣播稱，德戈林元帥，突往訪羅馬，與義首相墨索里尼協議甚久，旋並赴那不勒斯，與該地之德軍司令官會談。</p>
<h3>東線決戰態勢　德國夏季攻勢準備完成</h3>
<p>（柏林牧特派員一日發）</p>
<p>高茂萊亦對之深感棘手。至少因突尼西亞之急切不能攻下，致反軸心軍不能利用爲跳板，得以早日侵入歐洲，因此，軸心軍有充分時間，積極準備在東部戰綫捲土重來。換句話說，因突尼西亞的死守及大西洋沿岸要塞綫的完成，組和了反軸心軍開闢第二戰綫以威脅德國後方，德軍因而得在新的計劃下，傾其全力專從事於對蘇的殲滅戰。一時盛傳的夏季攻勢中止說，早已潛踪滅跡，全德國的期待，現正集中於「德蘇的最後決戰」。</p>
<p>事實上，在東部戰綫，近數日來，業已發生了暗示未來戰局大發展的新情勢。尤以紅軍自四月二十八日以來加强對高加索的庫彭區域的攻擊，絡續自後方調集援軍，此事實極爲當地軍事專門家所重視。紅軍在庫彭地區的新行動，顯然意在德軍開始夏季攻勢之前，先期發動猛烈攻勢。而德軍方面大攻勢的準備，可見之於希特勒與歐洲各國代表的會談，而以二十九日與法國總理賴伐爾的會見爲最後一幕。從這雙方的行動對照起來，東綫大戰的爆發。將較預料的時期早日見之實現。</p>
<p>然而關於未來大攻勢重心的所在點，依然衆說紛紜，莫衷一是。對此問題，任何人不能遽下正確的預斷，不過二十七·二十八日德國各報自冬季戰以來初次明確揭示了東部戰綫的現在位置的戰况地圖，此圖足爲預測之一有力的幫助。</p>
<p>據該圖所示，現在德軍的固定戰綫，起自阿索夫海沿岸，塔根洛格之東，沿繆斯戰棧北上，掠唐納資河西岸而迂迴卡科夫東方，連結現在蘇聯手中的庫斯克之西的百公里的雨葉里斯克及塞倍萊斯克，而向東方突出，圈住最東端外側陣地奥萊爾，再向西北成一直綫，直走維里基盧奇的西方。</p>
<p>這戰綫就是過去拉爾齊夫，維亞慈瑪地區撤退後所保持的固定綫，設定於普里耶斯克，斯摩倫斯克，皮台波斯克之可動的後方第一綫。在維里基盧奇與列寗格勒之間的北部戰綫，筆直地延伸至北方，沿羅亞特河至伊爾鬥湖，包圍斯達拉耶爾茲薩及諾波哥羅特兩市，再自該湖西岸起，沿鮑爾霍夫河西岸至南巴河，轉西北向而形成列寗格勒之包圍陣。此外，又在北高加索西部庫彭河下流地區的諾波洛雪斯克設定爲最前綫。上述戰綫形態的特徵，有如次幾點：</p>
<p>（一）在卡科夫爲止的南部戰棧，重又奪回在冬季戰中被蘇聯所收復的地區，復返去冬末期時的原有位置。</p>
<p>（二）放棄爾齊夫，維亞慈瑪地區及庫斯克地區，去冬末期的該方面戰綫，發生了變化。</p>
<p>上述二個最堪注目的事實，自塔根洛格之東方起，以至列寗格勒的包圍陣，全部戰區，聯結成長大的一綫，而且一部分業已堅强地築成要塞。這事實在觀測未來希特勒戰略的動向上，給與重大的暗示，即是說，在任何戰區，都可以成爲發動大攻勢的前驅。</p>
<p>其次，至於發動大攻勢的時機問題，德國某報稱：</p>
<p>各種戰戰鬥資材業已充分準備，大軍團及强大的預備軍，業已兼取攻守二種姿勢，枕戈待發。」</p>
<p>據此看來，準備已經完成，一何時」的問題，全視紅軍的動向，或突尼西亞及世界其他各戰綫的狀態，以及夏季攻勢的作戰方向與規模，而由希特勒來決定。預言式的斷定固然不可能，不過至少戰機却一天天的成熟起來。而且因爲（一）西都强大防衛要塞的構築完成，（二）東部新攻擊中武器的配備，（三）全歐洲人的物的大動員計劃之完成。故未來的大攻勢，比第一次，第二次夏季攻勢當然不消說得，並無疑地將爲世界史上冠絕一時的，在空前的現模及周到的準備下實施的犬決戰。德意志第三帝國的隆簪，在此一戰。（翔：譯自五月三日東京讀賣報知）</p>
<h3>世界史上的一大悲劇（二）</h3>
<p>— 德富豬一郎</p>
<p>續六日本報</p>
<p>（二）沒有理想的英國</p>
<p>我們日本以八紘一宇爲肇國之本。在古代的希臘，有柏拉圖所理想的共和國，以哲人立於上位而指導民衆爲其理想。在中國，以堯舜禹湯，文武屬公，唐虞三代，爲政治的極致，爾後幾千年，無不以此爲標準。然而這所謂大英帝國，是有着什麼政治理想呢？且不說大英帝國，就是英本國自身，是以怎樣的根本意　爲其國家所固有的呢？</p>
<p>在英國，固然也有像托馬斯•摩爾（Sir　ThomasMore）的「島托邦」，但是那原是裨販柏拉圖的學說，以諷刺當時的政府和社會的，與英國政治的實際，完全沒有關涉。</p>
<p>我們如果一爲推究英國盛襄興廢的本末，則對於英國人的沒有理想，就會感覺驚異。他們對於國家之所以爲國家，全然沒有怎麼樣的理想，也全然沒有怎麼樣的信念。他們只是以現在爲現在而承受着。如果硬要叫他們說出一個所以然來，那末除了說國家是爲了個人的便宜而存在的之外，是得不到別的解答的。英國人徹頭徹尾對於國家是沒有宏遠的根本理想的；因之，國家的本身，也就有一種中心的力量。</p>
<p>盎格魯撤克遜原來是常識的民族，現實的民族。並不是有了理論而後有事實，而是有了事實而後有理論；並不是有了辭說而後有物，而是有了物而後有辭說的。那所謂英國的憲法，並不是製造的，而是成長的，即現實的本身，遂其自然成長的事相。而所謂現實的本身，究竟是那麼樣的一宗東西呢？正像英國史家西利所說：「英國的海軍，差不多像海盜。在英國看來，戰爭是一件致富的大事業，是一件最有利的營業，最有賺頭的業務，贏益最爲優厚的投資。」所以他們只在利益上翻着觔斗，除了利益之外，什麼也不想，什麼也不動，什麼事情也不幹。</p>
<p>要之，海盜的根性，是依着時間和塲所而變化的。這正如水，有時爲細流，有時爲深淵，有時爲急湍，有時爲大瀑布，有時爲海，至其水之爲水，却沒有變化；又如有時爲冰，有時爲溫湯，有時爲冷水，也同樣是水；只不過是海盜根性的應物附形而千變萬化罷了</p>
<p>話雖如此，但英國也並非沒有政論。豈但並非沒有政論，無軍在現代，英國竟可以稱之爲政論的宗家本山。的確，無論那個國家，大概都把英國當做行莊，由之以躉取政論的。我雖然不是個哲學家，不是個法政事家，然而以史的眼光看來，恐怕不妨說，英國的政說，正是把英國本身的那麼個嘴臉，加以理論的設明者。</p>
<p>假使把英帝國看做是從依利薩伯時什開始的，那末可以一加檢討那時代的培根的所論。培根是英國致知格物的一大哲學家，英國哲學的經騐派，沒有不仰他爲鼻祖的。他同時又和實際政治發生關係，在詹姆士一世時代，曾爲掌要大臣，封叙子爵，他雖然因着凟職的緣故，沾汚了名節，然而他之爲英國思想界的一大祖師，是誰也不能加以否定的</p>
<p>培根是英國倫理學上快樂說的創始者，而在政治上，又是一個徹頭徹尾的功利派。他說道：</p>
<p>「無論什麼人，不運動是不能保持健康的；國家也是如此。是故，眞正有着榮譽的戰爭，不能不說是一個眞實的運動。」</p>
<p>所以他是一個嘉許戰爭的人。他父說：</p>
<p>「國家必須在海陸方面，都躋於强盛。成爲海洋的王人，就是王國的經略。」</p>
<p>又說。</p>
<p>「君主必須對於其隣國的擴張領土，或是由着商業等等而成爲富國，戒備勿怠。外交政策的眞義，在於得到權力的均衡。」</p>
<p>又說：</p>
<p>霍布斯的這種學說，與其說是替那專制爲務的斯丟阿特王朝辯護，無寗說是給那當時廢掉斯丟阿特王朝而代之的克倫威兩的總統政治辯護爲當。爲什麼呢？因爲他的論旨，與其說是理論的正統還不如說是屈從於當時的强權而發的</p>
<p>「一國的强大，是他國成爲弱小的緣故。一方有所得，他方必有所損。</p>
<p>如果把以上的話細細玩味，則可稱爲英國的國是者，當是什麼一回事？三百五十年間的英國歷史，不是都歷歷然如指着掌紋那般分明了嗎，</p>
<p>有一個簡直可稱爲是培根門弟子的霍布斯者，曾經受過培根的敎誨，據說在他和另外諸人跟着培根散步於共庭園的時候，培根曾把心裏觸想所及的話，說給他們從遊者聽，他首先把培根的話，加以領悟理解而表諸文字。他又旅行過歐洲各地。在法國，他得就近觀察當時權勢赫奕的黎塞留（A.J.D.Rishelieu）公爵；在意大利，他獲交那個創唱地動說的伽利路。於此可以知道他的所得知識，是怎麼樣的豐富宏傳。</p>
<p>霍布斯的時代，是從淸敎徒革命以亘於查理士二世的復位期。他實是查理士二世做着太子時的數學敎師。他的政論，以契約說者稱於世。他說：</p>
<p>「人類在初生於世界的時候，心身都是互相平等的，從共和平而生出競爭來，從競爭而生出戰爭來，其戰爭並不是團體和團體的戰，而是人和人的戰。因着這個緣故，全世界上，混沌而沒有生產，沒有技藝，沒有文學，也沒有社會的快樂，而只是恐怖和危險的連續。即人生是寂寞的，是貧乏的，是卑猥的，是獸的，並且是短命的，於是乎互相的定，選一人爲首長，約全體服從其命令，於是才得到了和平，得到了安全。是故，一度移讓其權利之後，無論到了那麼樣的地步，都不能再拿回來的。所謂君主的意志，就是法律，其臣下只能行着君主所不加禁止的事情。」</p>
<p>可是霍布斯的這個契的說，一到陸克，全然被逆用了。陸克的父親，是淸敎徒派的兵士，也是一個紹承契約說的傳統者。陸克是一個學者，同時也是一個東西南北的人。他的「悟性論」，是世界上很有名的大著。他在英國經騐派的哲學家中，是可以看做爲其巨臂的一人。他和霍布斯的所見，完全立在相反的地位。他的所謂自然的狀態，並不是像霍布斯所說那樣的修羅塲。據他說來，人類的自然狀態是：</p>
<p>「人類並不是人和人相火併的戰爭狀態，而是好意互助的和平狀態。但是爲了對於這個狀態與以安全和恒久性的緣故，依着各人的意志，互相締結契約。所　這契約一度成立之後，當然要加以服從的。但是萬一在君主破壞了這個契約的時候，要加反抗，重行選舉能够實行這個契的的人，也是當然的道理。」</p>
<p>他這樣的一段話，不妨看做是替一六六八年的革命——即把詹姆士二世放逐國外而迎回澳稜治公威廉和其妃瑪麗於荷蘭——做辯護的。而且他竟直大敵人之室，奪取其戟，把替專制主義立論的霍希斯的愈見，反接過來，以樹立了自由主義的根本義。在他的眼目中，不認有所謂國家的一個體系的存在，只把國家作爲個人的集合體。其目的是在極有限制的範圍內，擁護共同的便宜；一切的權利，是各個人所固有的。這樣，恰把國家看做有限責任股份公司一般。</p>
<p>我們現在並非在討論這個學說的當否。但是陸克的這個社會契的說，是把英國人的關於國家的觀念，一點不打錯描寫出來，此點覺得有在這裏加以特堆的必要。總之，霍布斯像荀子一樣，是從性惡說出發的；陸克如同孟子一般，是從性　說出發的。並且還和孟子的認有革命的權利一般，陸克也照樣地認有革侖的權利。但是所同的地方，也只止於此而已，至於在陸克的全然把政治看做一個商業公司，孟子却把政治看做是實行最高的理想的一點上，　兩者却是截然大異其趣的。</p>
<p>英國的政論會經怎樣地波及於他國呢？這只要是熟讀歐洲歷史的人，都是知道的。法國的孟德斯鳩，福祿特爾和盧梭之徒，是從什麼地方得到他們的意見的呢？得到了他們意見的酵母嗎？像法國革命宣言中的自由，平等，博愛三主義，其淵源是在那兒呢？英國的社會契約論，到了美國，成爲美國的獨立檄文：移入法國，成爲法國革命的宣言。不管是直接或是間接，其宗家本山，終不能不說是英國。</p>
<p>挨德蒙德•柏克，大聲疾呼以非難法國革命，想來他或者是志記了法國的革命論的原理原則，差不多都是從英國輸入的吧！</p>
<p>休謨的快樂說，邊沁，穆勒父子的功利說，以及於斯賓塞的虛無說中參以若干物理學或生物學的進化論之社會平衡論等，都是沒有超脫個人主義，自由主義，享樂主義的範圍的，而在這三主義昂頭　手大踏步橫行的時候，要國家不淪於衰亡，那裏能够呢？現在遭大英帝國的巨漢，正　跑了這三個主義，淹纏於再起的病床！（丁：譯自四月廿九日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>日大使館廣田部長　批評羅邱再度會見</h3>
<p>日本大使館上海事務所發言人廣田情報部長，昨（十二）日下午三時，假華懋飯店八樓，循例舉行招待本市中國新聞記者團常會席上，對英首相邱吉爾於十一日率領英政治要人及軍部陸海空軍重要人員，赴美國華盛頓與美總統羅斯福會見之任務，詳加批評。</p>
<p>再度會見</p>
<p>廣田部長首謂：關於英首相邱吉爾此次赴美華府與美總統羅斯福會見，意義殊堪玩味，蓋邱吉爾與羅斯福曾於本年一月抄，在卡薩白郞加舉行會談，至今閱時未及四月，又作再度會見之舉，其主要原因，爲英美二國之各項問題，急需解決者頗多。本年一月底之羅邱會見，所決定作戰方針，因未感滿足，須修改處尚多，同時，反軸心方面英美兩國外交關係，難感滿意，及英蘇之關係微妙，此外對重慶關係，亦未能順利進行，他如波蘭·澳洲·阿刺伯·等諸問題，懸案未決頗多參至英美兩國之國內問題，如美國內之罷工，煤礦陷於停頓狀態，軍需物資與消費物資之量之不足，亟需彌補，增加生產，故亟待商討解決者，昔有派英外長艾登赴美活動，最近有前任美駐蘇大使台維斯赴蘇協議消息發表，惟因間題廣泛嚴重，雄以解決，致此次邱吉爾親自赴美，再度與羅斯福會見，而商討決定方針，俾有所改善，及解決其間各項難題，故此次會見之任務，吾人均可想像得之。</p>
<p>意義何在</p>
<p>邱吉爾此次赴美軍事上政治上各項懸案之解決，日後當有所發表，此乃吾人所可斷言者，然英美無論在此次會見，而達到會議上之結論，惟因英美作戰目的，全係違反正理，且決難改變其作戰目的，此實爲政治方針之錯誤，故無論其迭再發表改善，然吾人深信決不能產生有利於全世界人類之結論，即使改正，在大東亞戰爭上亦難取優勢，蓋吾人此次作戰力量之根木，基於遵照作戰道義上之精神，犧牲生命，矢忠矢男，加强作戰之信念，故在作戰力量觀之，於歐洲作戰與太平洋作戰上，軸心國早佔一切優勝於反軸心國家，事實俱在，無庸贅述，故彼等會議結論何如，均不足動搖吾人最後勝利之信念。再此次會議，反軸心方面，蘇聯史太林及渝蔣介石，均未被邀參加，於此可見反軸心國毫無團結，且給予吾人之印象，更可斷言決不能發揮任何一絲力量。總之，此種會議，殊無特殊之價値存在云云，末對北非等問題，解釋頗詳。</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>華股業商復業以後</h3>
<p>我們在四月二十九日論「華股業商復業問題」裏面，認爲當局進行華股商號的審查與登記，確爲又一賢明的措施，可是有待於早日的貫澈。如今，已領得執照的華股商號，業已先行啟封。即日復業了。</p>
<p>因此，我們感覺在現時厲行抑低物價政策之下不論那一種市場，凡與物價中足以發生關係者，無不有密切注意的必要。所以，取範圍積，有當局派員澈查，和調查倉庫存貨的擊動；取締投機，有當局限制放款，和提議合併小銀行的舉動的同時，我們感覺到一個　有興趣的問題，認爲當加以研究與判斷的，就是物價何以上漲？股價何以上漲？</p>
<p>物價上漲的主要原因，是由於投機囤積的居奇，以致造成人民對於未來物賣缺乏的恐慌心理；股價上漲的主要原因，就常理而言，是由於企業資產的增値，因而堅定投一，物價上漲與股價上漲的主因，是截然不同。再從事實方面講，日本物價是，有嚴格的統制，却是股市在正常的發展中，仍復邁步前進，而且幾年來股票的發行，大有與日俱進之勢。足見物價的限制，並未阻止股價的上漲，股價的上漲，也並未影響物價的騰貴。因此，我們不妨作成一個結論：股票市場爲資本市場，與商品市場不同；股價代表企業資產價值，與物價不同。</p>
<p>基於這樣一個觀點，我們不得不希望華股業商復業以後，共同一致努力於華商股票市塲的正常發展。所爲正常發展，就是共謀脚地的堅實，共圖緩步的升騰，庶不致兎起　落，造成股價的暴漲暴落，使民衆對於企業，對於股票，發生不良的心理影響。</p>
<p>在健全的組織，正常的發展中，華商股票市塲，必然成爲人民公衆投資的唯一園地。這是我們所敢斷言的。</p>
<h3>張金海案　市府接法總領覆文　褚部長談話稱交涉差告段落　法領事法庭昨再度開庭審訊</h3>

<h3>實部公佈　主要商品登記規則</h3>
<p>國府前頒佈主要商品囤積治罪條例中，第九條明定主要商品之必須登記，第三條明定對不履行法定登記手續者之刑事處分，該條例公佈後，國府即以實業部爲中心，研究主要商品登記規則，現已得有成案，於五月十一日以部令公佈，此規則可視爲主要商品囤積治罪條例之部分細則，於登記規則中第二條，對「主要商品」有所解釋，第三條規定登記義務人，（詳條文）第四條規定登記手續與登記事項，原條第三項中並明示須登記「商品之來源，及其取得之時期與價値」登記事項共八項，似義完　，第五條乃規定同業公會，與會員間之登記檳利義務關係，第九條特別規定：「主管官署得隨時派員檢查倉庫，及公司行號，主要商品之存貨」之耀力，本規則施行後，不僅政府取締囤積之決心可見，而主要商品囤積條例之附屬法則，亦因而完備。</p>

<h3>強化國府與囤積問題（五）</h3>
<p>所望於商統會者</p>
<p>爲求大東亞戰爭的勝利，決定了新經濟政策，先有全國商業統制總會的設立，繼又從　於確立其下曆機構，低物價政策，也將付諸實施，際茲革古鼎新時期，如商統會之下的工商同業公會員有囤積物資，貪圖暴利行爲，則新經濟政策，顯然受了這般人的蹂躪，其罪殺不可恕，期望國府澈底解決囤積問題的聲浪，母寗謂是期望商統會實踐其政策的呼聲。</p>
<p>低物價政策，可謂是新經濟政策中的重要方針之一，商統會之方向，不外爲促進與內地之物資交流，俾得推進低物價政策，然其前途困難猶多，上次中國工業銀行企劃主任潘仰堯氏對此曾經發表意見，他認爲實施低物價政策，必須國府與商統會之決心與毅力，蓋棉紗之限價爲五千五百元，而其原料之棉花，限價爲一千一百五十元，此價實太便宜，市塲上遂不肯以此限價交易，都在黑市中買賣。</p>
<p>假使不考慮此種實際情形，單是把原料及製品的價格定得很低，結果反助長黑市交易，其他物價也跟着　貴。商業資本的唯利是圖，阻礙了低物價政策，所以國府對一切阻礙低物價政策者，唯有施行激烈措置，那來在國府指導下的商機會，方始可能維持低物價政策，收買原料，供應生產品，所以，國府的責任，至重且巨，爲求完成此艱巨責任，國府應有悲壯的決心，關於商統會之現在與今後的問題，留待他日的機會再論，這裏單講點期望於國府與商統會對囤積問題請求，（雲鵬：續譯大陸新報）</p>

<h3>調整上海政治經濟機構問題</h3>
<p>因治外法權之撤廢，上海之政治，經濟應如何調整，頗爲中日各方所關心，尤以最近國府駐滬機關與特別政府之統一的調整，成爲重要問題。此項調整問題，並非始於今日，例如舊社會運動指導委員會興舊社會局，實業部駐滬辦事處，財政部駐滬辦事處與現在經濟局之關係，亟須調整。再就强化市政府與統一指導新經濟政策，以及撤廢治外法權後再組織上海之準備工作而論，均有從速加以調整之必要，但是現實方面，適與統一調整之途徑相背反，故各方料此深爲矚目。</p>
<p>查半年以前，國府之駐滬機關已有四十左右，最近史多，約達七十之數。按其木來之使命爲國府與市府或上海財界及其個聯絡性質，但目下則越出範圍，成爲特殊之實践活　機關，其活動工作，對於加强市府與發展市府，頗有障礙。</p>
<p>關於上項間題，綜合租界各　之意見，大體一如次：</p>
<p>事變以還，租界各界之正常發展，因有多種繁複指導監督，故備受限制。大東亞戰爭以後，英美之政治，經濟上勢力，已完全肅淸，再如日本聲明撤廢治外法權後，接受國府統一指導監督之方向，早已確立，外交與特殊之中央財務，又當別論。其他各部門，亟應改良，不能由國府與市府分兩路指導監督，應由國府指導　督市政府，市政府則直接指導監督上海市政治，經濟，文化才合眞理，外界認爲現在之市政府負有如此重大使命，而其機構與人材，尚感貧乏，旣有此貧乏現象，則應採取適當措置，使其成爲有力之機構。在擬行此種措置時，行政院各部之駐滬機關跡近濫說，爲上海前途計，實未可樂觀。且駐滬各機關之間，缺少聯絡，結果恐有助長派閥政治勢力活躍之虞。目下已可謂係國府確立大市政府主義乃至市政府中心主義之最好時機，急起調整，統一指導，實爲各方所深切盼望者：（雲鵬：譯自五月十二日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>事實勝於雄辯</h3>
<p>— 凌祖仁</p>
<p>我們說一句話，當然比做一件事情，來得輕便得多，况且「說話」又不比做事情那般的吃力，和容易落着痕跡，無怪，不少的人，就總是儘說着那種不負責任的話了。</p>
<p>聽他們口頭的說話，眞是娓娓動聽，使聽的人覺得他是如何的偉大呀！無論什麼重大的事情，他似乎都可以勝任，甚至對於世界的改造工作，他也可以不費吹灰之力而達到的，不過，假使我們冷眼的去看他的行事呢！却不然了，不是言而不行，就是行而不澈底，他們的言行，似乎永不會一致的。</p>
<p>一個人，把「言語」來欺騙人家，那大不了不過是人家暫時的受他一次騙而已，但是，他那般「言行不一」的永久欺騙他自己，他就成了怎樣的一個人呢？</p>
<p>雖然我們不一定要像那般大人物一般的，說起話來有一定的價値和力量，但是，我認爲假使你不願意你成功一個欺騙自己的人，那末，我們應該絕對的尊重我們的言語，應該說到必行，假使，一件事情，你覺得沒有一定成功的把握時，我勸你還是不說出口的好，因爲假使你說出口而做不到，你可又成了一個放大砲的人了。</p>
<p>往往一個不聲不響肯埋下頭舌幹的人，他的成就，總是比那些慣會誇大口的人迅速得多。</p>
<p>把事實來表現我們的力量，才是人生中最有力的一種表現方式，事實總是勝過雄辯的呀！</p>
<p>總之，我們對於仟何事情，都該密切地愼審自己的力量，務必要做到，言而有信，言而必行。</p>
<h3>奇異的泡沫</h3>
<p>— 郭敏之</p>
<p>利用泡沬的工業最主要的就是麵包廠，它們利用酵母來製造氣泡，並且加意研究大麥的硬度，務求製造品充滿了佈置均勻的小孔，沒有發酵的麵包簡直是難以下嚥，而最合標準的麵包　是質量要輕而發酵要充分，因此麵包製造家全都使用着一種功效迅速的酵母，使它在普通的麵粉裏能發生足够的氣體，成爲極小的空隙。</p>
<p>其次最大規模的泡沫工業就是鑛業了，例如硫鑛和矽鑛的採取法就是先把鑛土研得粉碎然後再設法把鑛物和雜質分離開來，硫黃對於某種油類極易附着，而砂則很易爲水所滲透利用它們這種特牲，把每一噸的鑛土調和在四至五噸的水裏而，使它變成泥漿，再加入二十磅左右的特種油，然後將它劇烈地攪拌，直到表面上發生一層厚氣泡，這些氣泡的外膜就是起初加進去的油，裏面吸收了很多硫黃的微粒因而形成了略帶黏性的泡沫，質量較輕而浮在最上曆的表面，矽並不和油質沾染而與水滲透，故而一直沉到底下，這方法是最爲經濟而簡單，許多含量極寡的礦土都可用這方法來分析。</p>
<p>泡沫還對於近代的消防術有很大的幫助，所謂「滅火藥沫」其實就是大量的二氣化碳泡沫，它是由於硫酸鉛和碳酸鈉的化合作用而發生，如果把大量的藥沫澆射在正在燃燒着的油類甚至汽油上面，都能浮在火燄之上，隔絕了它的空氣而使燃燒停止。</p>
<p>近代的消防隊大都備有携行的藥沫噴射機，它只有普通的行囊那麼大，裏面却含有高者的壓縮空氣可以把藥水强力地噴射出來，而形成一陣固定而窒息的泡沫，凡是遇到油類或化學藥品的火燄，不是先用水和黃砂所能奏效時，就非要借車它不可了</p>
<p>流行到世界各地的啤酒也是泡沫的產品之一，關於啤酒，薑汁酒，麥酒以及香樓酒，它們全都會發生泡沫，這些泡沫有　很能持久，有的却很快就消滅了。</p>
<p>浮水肥皂也是利用泡沫的工業之一，在製造它的時候，使它在凝固時含入多量細小而均勻的氣泡，比重减輕了，在水中自然會浮起來了，冰淇淋也是非靠泡沫不能製成的，如果搖攪不够周到，那它就會凝成一塊堅硬的冰了。</p>
<p>還有一種非常奇異的作用就是顏色的形成，在鳥類的羽毛裏根本就沒有藍色的色素，但是鸚鵡和孔雀們又怎麼會有艷麗奪目的藍色羽毛呢，原米它們的藍羽毛是由許多透明的角質小氣泡結合而成的，後而還具有黑色的背景把光綫全都吸收了，只有藍色及紫色的光波最短，所以就被反射出來而至現出綺麗的藍色或紫色了。</p>
<p>獸類的白毛也並不具有白色素，它也是由無數的極細氣泡集合而成，這些氣泡全都是透明的，因而全部的光綫都可由它折射而呈純潔的白色—，但人類的白髮却是和它們絕不相像，白髮的成因是由於體質變異以致頭髮的化學成份也缺乏黑色素而獨多白色素，當然就「兩鬢斑斑」了。</p>
<h3>讀者札記</h3>
<p>— 靑照</p>
<p>對一切俱可放棄野心；但對知識非永在野心不可。</p>
<p>「朋友與眞理皆爲吾人所愛，但，朋友果使眞理瀕於危境，吾人亟應捨朋友而取眞理」</p>
<p>巴爾扎克的著作裏，頗多「警句」，拿來現時看，其意義更覺眞實：</p>
<p>—我是一個世俗的人，我懼怕上帝，可是我更懼怕窮苦的地獄呀！貧無一文，在我們的現在的社會制度裏，是不幸的最後階段。我是我的時代的人，我是崇拜金錢的呀！</p>
<p>—埃及借了希伯萊人很多金錢，他們並不是跟在上帝的子民後邊走；而是跟在資本的後邊呀！</p>
<p>前者暴露了拜金主義者的內心秘密；後者說明了資本主義社會「人跟錢走」的一般現象</p>
<p>一切事物，各有其自身價値，超過限度，便要「合理變成了荒謬；仁慈變成了災殃』了</p>
<p>沉默並非消極，牠是進一步去認識事物的眞相所必需的態度。</p>
<p>回憶，也不一定是「殘骸的迷戀」；假如你覺得必須從回憶中去尋求你的歷史位置與敎訓的話。</p>
<h3>語下留情</h3>
<p>— 夢齡</p>
<p>也許你從來不曾想到你自己要「面子」而別人要「面子」的吧！因此便有許多地方使人難堪而自己尚未知覺的不幸的事情發生了。</p>
<p>替人保全「面子」是我們與人相處的重要方法，但人們往往爲了別人的一點過失，便滔滔不絕地予人不能容受的指摘，敎訓，責備，甚至於爲了要顯出自己的理直氣壯，便在大衆面前當塲開銷，大聲斥責，將別人的一張面皮撕得四分五裂，再也無面目見人……</p>
<p>其實這是一種自私自利的行爲，雖然你的本意「也許」是好意，是勸人改過，但是給你如此一來，好意變成惡意不要去說它，而你的話，在他早已成了「狗血噴頭」了。</p>
<h3>僥倖</h3>
<p>— 維煥</p>
<p>「僥倖心」能使有爲的「人生」趨往「邪路。」因爲往往一個賭徒，他雖明知道賭窟老板，決不會貼本的，然而他所以要如此，無非是一僥倖心」的作祟，他想：萬一僥倖，給我發了財呢？因而流連賭窟，樂而忘返，終於傾家蕩產，淪爲乞丐，有爲的人生，就此完結。再試觀盜賊其搶或偷錢物，他們難道不知道這是要觸犯法律，身入囹圄的嗎？然他們爲何要明知故犯呢？這無非也是「僥倖心」作祟所致。……所以僥倖心實是人生成功途上的破壞者。</p>
<p>或許有人要反詰，說：自古迄今的科學家，不也是一時「僥倖」成功的呢？如著名的「阿基米得原理」不就是阿基米得在浴室裏，見到浴水外溢，而想出了這原理嗎？因洗澡而想出　原理，豈小「僥倖」？而牛頓因見得一隻蘋果的下落，而發現了一地心引力」，這是更「僥倖」了。至於瓦特發明蒸汽機，是因一把茶壺裏的水沸了。衝起了茶壺蓋而發明的，這更是奇乎其奇了。「僥倖」中之「僥倖」。……然而，試平心一想，在他們之前，不知有多少浴室裏的侍者，花園裏的園丁，廚房裏的僕人，爲何沒有發明呢？必待諸科學家來發明呢？</p>
<p>要知道他們是把平日所要解決的難題，久蓄心中，隨時隨地思念着它，因此一遇暗示，便有所感悟，因而成功一偉人。如果，我們立志做一個偉人，這種把自己研究的事物，久蓄心中，隨時隨地思念的精神，眞該我們去模仿！去實行！</p>
<p>總之，僥倖心是可使人生旗往邪路，所以，我們要有燦爛光明的人生，就不應該讓僥倖心盤桓於心靈，時時刻刻思念着它。</p>
<p>因此勸人也要有藝術，旣然你的本意是出自衷腸，你就應當要使它達到目的，對別人是一種幫助，對自己也是一件功德。</p>
<p>別的事情要直截了常，爽爽快快，要閃電戰術，惟其勸人非要迂　曲折，面面俱到，遠交近攻，移花接木不可，因爲每個人要使他聽了你的話而說一聲「是」，而去「改過自新」是一件不易的事。</p>
<p>我以爲在勸人的時候應該一步一步來，你不妨先贊美他的長處，以懇切誠實作序幕，然後不妨說「我自己以前也曾經犯過這錯的，後來才改的」，再不妨用暗示的方法，方始不被被勸者憎惡，而忠言逆耳，有些人是固執不悟的，則不妨用商量代替命令，保持他的面子，再說出如能改過的話，前途如何有希望，這樣的勸下去，我相信到　後必定會樂意接受你的忠言的，那麼你的目的便可以達到了。</p>
<p>處於現在的亂世中，即便不去勸人，似乎也應該言語有所檢點吧！否則後患無窮呢，是嗎？</p>
<h3>萍踪小語</h3>
<p>— 謙父</p>
<p>一憂一怒，最足傷害身心，凡欲培養身心者，當從節制憂怒做起。</p>
<p>人們日常的際遇生活，都是構成學問，思想，及人生觀的良好材料。</p>
<p>無高尚的知己朋友暢叙，而感覺孤陋寡聞，寂寞難堪的時候，可以閱些名人傳記或格言一類的書籍，足以補此缺憾</p>
<p>有些樹很小，而結果很多很甜；有些樹雖大，而結果不小甜，或甚至絕無果結。所以，一個人之結果與否，或結果多少好壞，不在乎地位高下，才能大小，學問多寡，而在乎品格優劣。（却酬）</p>

<h3>Discussing the Improvement of Police Administration from the Zhang Case</h3>
<p>The Zhang Jinhai case has already been settled with compensation from the French Concession Municipal Council, and the perpetrators have been punished according to the law. This case has now come to an end. From the beginning, we have always considered this case to be a legal matter, not a diplomatic one; a social matter, not a political one. At the same time, we specifically pointed out that the French Concession Municipal Council should also recognize this point and promptly bring the perpetrators to justice and hold them accountable to society, so as not to cause other unexpected and adverse consequences. Now, the French Concession Municipal Council authorities can value public opinion and take legal measures, which is still somewhat satisfactory. We sincerely hope that the French Concession Municipal Council and other agencies responsible for police affairs will, in the future, handle criminal cases by strictly following legitimate legal procedures, especially by completely abolishing the cruel penalties that are not used in modern civilized countries, so that unfortunate incidents similar to the Zhang case will never be seen again in the future. This would not only be a blessing for society, but also a blessing for the improvement of relations between police agencies and citizens.</p>
<p>Based on our observations of the Zhang case, we have high expectations for the future of police administration in the Shanghai area. As stated in yesterday's commentary, "The government and the people should be united, and the police are the most suitable agents to promote this work." Therefore, in addition to discussing the strengthening of the police system in the Peaceful Zone yesterday, we are today specifically discussing Shanghai's police administration.</p>
<p>Currently, there are three main police agencies in the Shanghai area: the Shanghai Municipal Police (in the International Settlement), the French Concession Police, and the Shanghai Special City Police Bureau. In the current situation, the citizens have the highest expectations for the police administration of the International Settlement. If the police administration of the International Settlement is well-managed and serves as a model, then the French Concession and the city area will also be able to learn from it and strive for perfection.</p>
<p>Looking back at the past history of the police administration of the International Settlement, before December 8th of the year before last, during the era of British control, a completely colonial policy was adopted. Citizens were only treated with contempt and oppression. Poor Indians, especially our Chinese employees, were initially forced to treat our citizens with contempt and oppress them. Then, their minds were numbed, and they gradually forgot their original identities. They eventually relied on power and acted as bullies, so that citizens feared them like snakes and scorpions and respected them like ghosts and gods, thus forming a situation of mutual hatred and opposition.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the police administration of the International Settlement has been managed by the friendly nation of Japan. We know that Japan's domestic police administration has always been renowned for its thoroughness and meticulousness. Over the past year, facts such as the establishment of the Baojia system and the disappearance of kidnapping and robbery cases are sufficient to prove the progress made in management. However, generally speaking, due to the urgency of time, there are still many areas that need continuous and redoubled efforts for improvement. Based on the principle of speaking frankly and without reservation, we offer the following further suggestions:</p>
<p>(1) Fundamentally, the British colonial police policy should be thoroughly reformed. Any systems, regulations, organizations, and administrations that carry the colonial colors of enslavement and oppression of citizens must be completely eliminated in both spirit and substance, and policies that cherish citizens, guide citizens, and promote close cooperation must be fully adopted. This is the most crucial step.</p>
<p>(2) In the past, the White Russian and Indian police officers employed by the British had their minds deeply and irreparably numbed. We hope that the police authorities will provide these police officers with special spiritual training, carefully assign them to their duties, and ensure that they understand that China and Japan are now in a close, cooperative relationship of sharing weal and woe, and that it is no longer the era of British enslavement and oppression. At the same time, we hope that Chinese police officers should also awaken themselves, respect and cherish their own dignity, and be cordial and harmonious with citizens, serving them honestly.</p>
<p>(3) In the past, police officers were deeply influenced by British enslaving habits. Whenever citizens—including residents of all classes and occupations—made the slightest offense, instead of first pointing out their mistakes with advice, they would arbitrarily order them around according to their whims. "Those who love themselves will be loved by others." We are deeply moved by the amiable and courteous manner of Japanese police officers towards citizens in Japan. We urgently hope that the authorities will strictly warn their subordinates to make "respect for courtesy" the first priority in police training.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the salaries of patrol officers and police officers, we advocate that they must be increased so that they are sufficient to maintain the minimum living standards of an individual and their family. Insufficient salaries are tantamount to encouraging corruption. Therefore, raising salaries is the fundamental factor in curbing all malpractices. We believe that every citizen is willing to pay the maximum price to provide funding for running "good police administration." We hope that the authorities will give this serious consideration.</p>
<p>Finally, we further hope that public organizations should establish institutions with the welfare of citizens as a prerequisite, regularly providing advisory services to address citizens' grievances. We know that ordinary people—especially those from the countryside—are afraid to speak up even if they have suffered losses. If public organizations can file complaints on their behalf, right and wrong can be clarified. The police authorities will also recognize this as cooperation between public organizations and the authorities and will be happy to accept and handle the matter. Then, over time, incidents of patrol officers despising citizens will gradually decrease, and the relationship between citizens and police agencies will gradually become closer.</p>

<h3>The Japanese Military Authorities Announce Victory in the Occupation of Buthidaung. The Expulsion of British Forces from Burma is Not Far Off. Japanese Aircraft are Active in the South Pacific, Causing Extreme Fear in Australia.</h3>
<p>Rangoon, December 12th (Central News Agency) – After destroying the main force of the British Indian enemy army near Imphal on the Indo-Burmese border, Japanese troops continued to defeat the enemy's northern raiding force and conquer the stream and forest areas. On the 8th, they occupied Buthidaung, a key enemy stronghold on the Maungdaw River, and crushed the enemy's attempt to recapture Burma. At that time, because of the skillful Japanese operations, the enemy was extremely embarrassed and fell into a state of confusion. The results of the occupation of Buthidaung are listed below: 1,600 enemy bodies were left behind, 100 people were captured, 300 horse carcasses were abandoned, and the Japanese army captured and destroyed 10 enemy tanks and tractors, 42 large and small cannons, 182 trucks, 268 rifles, 5 grenade launchers, 46 automatic rifles, 49 light machine guns, 4 pistols, 20 rolls of barbed wire, a large number of bridging materials, several boxes of gunpowder, 3,750 rounds of various artillery shells, 19,600 rounds of rifle bullets, 630 hand grenades, 3,000 belt rings, 3,000 blankets, and countless gallons of gasoline. In addition, one enemy fighter plane was shot down, and one enemy gunboat was sunk. The enemy's offensive to reopen the Burma Road has been completely crushed.</p>
<p>Berlin, December 12th (Central News Agency) – German authorities issued a statement on the 11th, praising the effectiveness of Japanese troops fighting on the Burmese front. The statement said that after the British army's defeat, the fighting on the Burmese front had been quiet for a while. The Japanese army, determined to completely expel the British army from the Arakan Mountains, launched another offensive, which coincided with the beginning of the rainy season, making operations quite difficult. The British army believed that the Japanese army might not be able to advance further and secretly rejoiced. However, on the night of the 9th, the Japanese army occupied Buthidaung, the main British army position in the upper reaches of the Maungdaw River, and is now continuing to expand its gains. This move has completely shattered the British army's optimistic view. The complete expulsion of the British army from Burma by the Japanese army is imminent. Once realized, the Japanese army's offensive posture against India will be completed. Due to climatic conditions, it is unlikely that the Japanese army will launch an Indian operation at the moment. However, in terms of past battles, the Japanese army is superior to the British army in overcoming adverse climatic conditions.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, December 12th (Central News Agency) – The active presence of Japanese air forces in the South Pacific has caused extreme fear in Australia. According to a report from San Francisco, a spokesman for the Allied headquarters in the Southwest Pacific stated at a press conference on the 10th that the Japanese threat is increasing daily. The U.S. government has been strongly promoting the idea that the Japanese army has lost a large number of ships in the Pacific and has no remaining strength to launch further attacks, but in reality, there is no evidence that the Japanese army feels a shortage of ships. In addition, Australian United Australia Party leader Hughes warned on the night of the 10th that if the Japanese army cannot be driven out of its occupied territories in the South Pacific, Australia will not be free from great threats. Although the Australian people have made considerable efforts in the current war, they have not shown the same spirit of disregarding sacrifice as the soldiers on the front lines.</p>
<p>Lisbon, December 12th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Sydney, the Allied Headquarters in the Southwest Pacific announced the following on the 11th: 1.

If the Japanese army can use the time to strengthen its positions, it will be extremely difficult to fight against them.</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Achievements in Northern Hunan and Other Areas</h3>
<p>Hankou, December 12th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from the Hunan front, since elite Japanese troops launched a fierce sweeping operation against the 29th Army of the Chongqing government, a squad leader from a certain Japanese reporting unit in the area issued a statement on the 11th regarding the situation of the operation. He stated: "The characteristic of this battle is that our army overcame the difficulties of ponds and lakes in the Dongting Lake sweeping operation. The area is full of ponds and lakes, and the defending enemy army, with thousands of dikes as their positions, attempted to stubbornly resist, putting our army at a disadvantageous terrain. However, the Japanese army overcame this major natural obstacle and broke into the fortified positions of the first line of the Chongqing army, such as Gaojiaxiang, and advanced at a speed of 18 to 20 kilometers per day. After crossing Dongting Lake, they landed from behind the enemy near Tianxin Lake with fierce artillery fire, demonstrating the great power of the Japanese army. Since the start of the operation, the Japanese army has occupied a vast area of 80 kilometers in just six days, which is due to the intense combat spirit and speed of the Japanese army. Furthermore, after our army occupied Anxiang and Nanxian, we will pose a great threat to the enemy strongholds of Changsha and Changde."</p>

<h3>Japanese Ships Do Not Seem to Be Lacking</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuter's dispatch from Melbourne, the spokesperson of General MacArthur's headquarters in the South Pacific stated today that although Japanese merchant ships have suffered losses since the Pearl Harbor attack, there is no indication that they are suffering from a lack of merchant ship tonnage in the Southwest Pacific. Observations over the past few months indicate that Japan has concentrated a large number of ships from Rabaul in the east to Surabaya in the west. It would be a great mistake to believe that Japan's merchant fleet in this region, or its ability to supply its vast occupied territories, has been greatly weakened by losses. Since the beginning of the war, the Japanese have captured an estimated 475,000 tons of transport ships, and newly built ships in Japan are estimated at 450,000 tons. Demand for ship tonnage in the aforementioned regions has gradually recovered and is increasing daily, but there is no indication that a shortage of ships is hindering Japan's plans.</p>
<h3>Korea to Implement Volunteer Soldier System for Army and Navy</h3>

This policy has been prepared and finalized, and was officially passed by the Japanese Cabinet on the 11th. At the same time, the Japanese Information Bureau also officially announced this today. It is planned that preparatory training for these special naval volunteer soldiers will begin this year.</p>

<h3>German and Italian Troops on the Cape Bon Peninsula Launch Fierce Defensive Battle, British Troops Attack the Italian First Army's Position, Repelled by Valiant Axis Resistance</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to news from North Africa, Axis forces have launched a fierce defensive battle on the Cape Bon Peninsula against anti-Axis mechanized forces attacking from the northwest and west. However, due to the disparity in troop strength and weapons, they were forced to gradually retreat. The British First Army, after launching an attack from Hammam-Lif southeast of Tunis on the 10th, reinforced with new tank units and pressured the Axis forces. On the same day, they advanced to Soliman, nine miles east of that location. However, after the Axis forces destroyed 18 of their tanks, they reportedly retreated to the rear positions. On the 11th, anti-Axis forces again attacked from Soliman in two directions, one advancing eastward to Menzel Bouzelfa in the center of the Cape Bon Peninsula, and the other reportedly reaching Grombalia, seven miles south of Soliman. According to news from Algiers, a unit of British troops broke into Hammamet, 25 miles north of Enfidaville, on the morning of the 11th, but the Axis forces have not yet acknowledged this. On the 11th, German authorities only stated that anti-Axis forces had entered the western region of the Cape Bon Peninsula, and avoided providing further details. Axis sources continue to report that the Axis forces in the Naghzah region are continuing to resist.</p>
<p>Rome, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Italian military headquarters issued the following war report at noon on the 11th: 1. British forces on the Tunisian front repeatedly attacked the positions of the Italian First Army Corps, but were repelled by the valiant resistance of the Axis forces. At the same time, as a result of the Axis forces' fierce attack on the enemy's rear, they have recovered various favorable locations occupied by the enemy. 2. Enemy infantry and tank units in the eastern part of Tunisia engaged in fierce fighting with the Axis forces and have reached the southeastern coast of the Cape Bon Peninsula. 3. Our air force has made a long-range raid on the ports of Algiers and Gabes, severely damaging enemy port facilities.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency) - Captain Setorius, a military commentator for the Havas News Agency, declared today that German and Italian troops are still fighting on the Cape Bon Peninsula. Anti-Axis forces, after occupying Tunis, immediately believed that they could conquer the remaining Axis forces with all their troops in a matter of hours. However, the anti-Axis high command was mistaken in this regard. Although the Axis forces knew from the beginning that they had little chance, they continued to resist, repelling the attacks of the anti-Axis forces on Saturday and Sunday. Therefore, the anti-Axis high command had to send more tanks and infantry units, and assist with artillery and aircraft, to systematically prepare for another attack. Because the enemy forces were greatly superior, they penetrated deep into the Axis lines southeast of Hammam-Lif on Monday. On Monday evening, they attacked toward Hammamet on the southeastern coast of the peninsula via Soliman, cutting off the contact between the Axis forces fighting in Djebel Zaghouan and the northeastern mountains and the Axis forces resisting on the Cape Bon Peninsula. These two parts of the Axis forces are now isolated from each other and continue to resist, but the anti-Axis naval and air forces have completed the blockade of the peninsula, making it impossible to obtain supplies. Therefore, the Axis forces will soon run out of ammunition. After the fall of Tunis and Bizerte, the conquest of the remaining Axis forces in Tunisia by the anti-Axis forces is no longer a problem in terms of operations. In tactical terms, the anti-Axis forces have no major tasks to perform.</p>
<h3>Marshal Rommel Has Returned to Germany for Medical Treatment</h3>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency) - The German Supreme Headquarters announced today that Marshal Rommel, commander of the German Afrika Korps in North Africa, returned to Germany due to poor health after the Axis forces in Tunisia reached their new position at Gabes in March. It was also revealed that Rommel has received Germany's highest military decoration. Rommel is currently recovering his health, and after his recovery, he will be given a new appointment. According to a supplementary announcement issued by the Supreme Command, Rommel's illness was caused by his long stay in Africa. The announcement stated, "When the British forces began a large-scale attack on the El Alamein position in October 1942, Marshal Rommel was in Germany. His long stay in Africa had greatly damaged Rommel's health, so the repeatedly delayed medical treatment could no longer be avoided. However, as soon as Rommel heard the news of the British attack, he immediately stopped the treatment, ignoring the doctor's advice, and returned to Africa. He originally intended to stay in Africa temporarily, but after the landing of the Anglo-American forces in French North Africa, he extended his stay in Africa. Rommel led his troops, under constant attack from extremely superior enemy forces, to retreat to Tunisia, setting a historical example of evasive warfare. Later, Rommel's health deteriorated, so the Führer, after consulting with the Italian Prime Minister, decided to summon Rommel back to Germany immediately after the Axis forces reached the Gabes position, so that he could quickly recover his health. On March 11, 1943, Rommel reported to the Führer's headquarters and received the medal. Rommel's health is now recovering, and after he has fully recovered, the Führer will assign him a new task."</p>
<h3>U.S. Military Casualties</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency) - According to an official announcement from Washington today, the current total number of wartime casualties in the United States is 80,660, of which 12,964 are dead, 38,169 are missing, 16,200 are wounded, and 13,327 are captured. The total number of army casualties is 55,729, of which 5,770 were killed in action, 2,533 were wounded, 25,099 were missing, and 13,327 were captured. Among those killed in action, 469 were members of the Philippine Scouts, and among those wounded, 747 were members of the Philippine Scouts. In addition, 11,855 of those captured were members of the Philippine Scouts. The Navy's casualties, including the Marine Corps and the Coast Guard, totaled 7,194 dead, 4,669 wounded, and 13,068 missing.</p>
<h3>U.S. Secretary of the Navy Advocates Occupying Sicily</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 11th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Washington, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox strongly advocated that Sicily must be occupied in order to guarantee the anti-Axis control of the Mediterranean and to use it as a starting point for a landing operation in Europe. Knox stated at his regular press conference that Sicily in the hands of the Axis powers is sufficient to threaten the security of the anti-Axis powers in the Mediterranean. He stressed that it would be very beneficial for the anti-Axis powers to have a waterway from the Mediterranean to the Near East, but if Axis aircraft exist, they will specifically harass this secondary route of the anti-Axis powers.</p>
<h3>Churchill Crosses the Atlantic to Meet with Roosevelt to Discuss the Opening of a Second Front</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency) - According to an official announcement from Washington received here, Prime Minister Churchill arrived in Washington at 3:15 this afternoon to meet with President Roosevelt. He was accompanied by many army and navy experts. Although officials are strictly keeping the nature of the talks secret, the Washington press believes that they will discuss plans to open a new front on the European continent. Today's announcement has confirmed the rumors from Washington and London in recent days that Prime Minister Churchill has not shown his face in London for more than a week. In the past, he often reported the results of the war to the House of Commons himself, but this time the report on the North African war was presented to the House of Commons by Deputy Prime Minister Attlee. It was said that Roosevelt and Churchill might meet with Stalin in Cairo, but there were likely obstacles, so the leaders of the Chinese, British, and American governments held a meeting. A Reuters correspondent stated that there was no clear indication that Stalin would participate in the Washington meeting, or even that he had been invited to participate, but Stalin and Chiang Kai-shek would be notified of the progress of the meeting, as was the case at the Casablanca Conference.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - Observers here recently expressed their views on the Roosevelt-Churchill talks, saying that "British Prime Minister Churchill's decision to visit Washington on the 11th with military leaders, following the Quebec Conference to hold the fourth Roosevelt-Churchill talks, has aroused general attention. When the Quebec Conference was decided, British and American news agencies insisted on silence beforehand, but this time they have vigorously promoted it, speculating in many ways about the content of the talks, or for the imminent opening of a second front, but the truth about it has not yet been revealed, so it is too early to criticize this matter at this time, but Churchill said in Parliament that the main purpose of this visit to the United States is to congratulate Roosevelt on the success of the North African operation, this statement may be the truth. As for whether the current situation of the Tunisian war can be credibly said to be a genuine success, and whether they are considering whether they can launch a landing operation in Europe in the future, let us put that aside for now, but they are undoubtedly trying to take this opportunity to promote a major turning point in order to attract their own people and threaten neutral countries, which is why they are expanding their publicity in advance. This time, they were able to achieve the so-called victory in North Africa because of the French military's planned actions. Therefore, when discussing the next operational plan at this meeting, they may presumptuously believe that they can change the war situation in Europe and East Asia. This is truly a pipe dream, because launching a landing operation in Europe is absolutely impossible in fact. The British and American operational leaders have long been aware of this, so the main purpose of this meeting is still to engage in propaganda, and its result will be the same as the Quebec Conference, with no practical effect."</p>
<p>Stockholm, 12th (Central News Agency) - An American newspaper correspondent in Washington reported that British Prime Minister Churchill will meet with Stalin after meeting with President Roosevelt. President Roosevelt suggested Washington as the meeting location because he finds traveling to be quite difficult.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 12th (Central News Agency) - After British Prime Minister Churchill arrived in Washington with the heads of the army, navy, and air force, the Associated Press and Reuters frequently transmitted reports about the importance of the meeting, saying that the issue of forming a second front might be agreed upon at this meeting. In view of the fact that the European focus doctrine decided at the previous Quebec Conference had aroused criticism from Chongqing and the Australian government, the Associated Press stated in its report that the issue of a counterattack operation in the Pacific might also be reviewed at this meeting. Reuters pointed out that Chairman Stalin does not seem to be sincere in participating in this meeting, saying that it is not known whether Chairman Stalin will be able to attend this Washington meeting, and whether he has been invited to attend, but it may still be the same as the Quebec Conference, and he and Chongqing Chiang will be notified of the progress of this meeting.</p>
<h3>Germany Declares Indifference to Franco's Peace Proposals, Resolves to Cooperate with Allied Nations to Strive for Victory</h3>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) - The German government authorities expressed their views on Spanish President Franco's advocacy of peace on the 11th, roughly as follows: (1) Although it may be necessary for neutral countries to advocate peace at this time, half a year after the outbreak of the war, the German government, regardless of how the Tunisian war situation collapses, will cooperate with all allied countries and move towards the road to victory without compromise, and is indifferent to peace. (2) Although it is natural for U.S. Secretary of State Hull and British Foreign Secretary Eden to reject President Franco's proposal, it is expected that a major decisive battle will soon unfold throughout the world, and when all preparations for carrying out a major decisive battle are being made, the question of who will win or lose the decisive battle is more worthy of attention than the question of whether a decisive battle can be avoided through peace. (3) Although the German people know that a decisive battle is not easy, the opposing camp must also have the same feeling. If the anti-Axis camp boasts of increased production, the German government can also clearly tell them that our military production has recently increased several times. (4) From a political point of view, the anti-Axis camp is plagued by the Soviet-Polish dispute and other discords. On the other hand, as a result of President Hitler's recent agreement with representatives of allied countries, all preparations for the decisive battle have been completed. As for what methods will be adopted during the decisive battle, and what its trends will be, although only a very small number of President's confidants know, it will ultimately have a decisive impact on the world war situation.</p>
<h3>Göring Goes to Rome to Meet with Italian Prime Minister</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters report from a Moscow broadcast, German Marshal Göring suddenly visited Rome and held lengthy talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, and then went to Naples to meet with the German commander in that area.</p>
<h3>Eastern Front Decisive Battle Situation: Germany Completes Preparations for Summer Offensive</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Berlin Correspondent, 1st)</p>
<p>Gao Maolai also feels deeply troubled by this. At least the urgency regarding Tunisia prevented its capture, which prevented the anti-Axis forces from using it as a springboard to invade Europe earlier. Therefore, the Axis forces have had ample time to actively prepare for a comeback on the Eastern Front. In other words, the tenacious defense of Tunisia and the completion of the Atlantic coastal fortifications have prevented the anti-Axis forces from opening a second front to threaten Germany's rear. The German forces have thus been able to devote all their efforts to a war of annihilation against the Soviet Union under a new plan. The once-popular theory of suspending the summer offensive has long disappeared. All of Germany's expectations are now focused on "the final decisive battle between Germany and the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>In fact, in the Eastern Front, in recent days, new situations have already occurred that hint at major developments in the future war. In particular, the Red Army has strengthened its attack on the Kuban region of the Caucasus since April 28th, and has continuously mobilized reinforcements from the rear. This fact is highly valued by local military experts. The Red Army's new action in the Kuban region is clearly intended to launch a fierce offensive before the German forces begin their summer offensive. The preparations for the German forces' major offensive can be seen in Hitler's meetings with representatives from various European countries, with the meeting with French Prime Minister Laval on the 29th being the final scene. Comparing these actions of both sides, the outbreak of the Eastern Front war will be realized earlier than expected.</p>
<p>However, there are still various opinions and no consensus on the location of the future major offensive's center of gravity. No one can make an accurate prediction on this issue. However, on the 27th and 28th, German newspapers for the first time since the winter war clearly revealed war situation maps of the current positions on the Eastern Front. This map is a strong help for one to make a forecast.</p>
<p>According to the map, the current fixed German front starts from the coast of the Sea of Azov, east of Taganrog, goes north along the Mius Front, skirts the west bank of the Donets River, bypasses the east of Kharkov, connects to the 100-kilometer-long Yeliseyevsk and Sebezh west of Kursk, which is now in Soviet hands, and protrudes eastward, encircling Orel, the easternmost outer position, and then goes northwest in a straight line, directly to the west of Velikiye Luki.</p>
<p>This front is the fixed line maintained after the retreat from the Rzhev and Vyazma areas in the past, set on the movable first line behind Pskov, Smolensk, and Vitebsk. On the northern front between Velikiye Luki and Leningrad, it extends straight to the north, along the Lovat River to Lake Ilmen, encircling the two cities of Staraya Russa and Novgorod, and then from the west bank of the lake, along the west bank of the Volkhov River to the Neva River, turning northwest to form the encirclement of Leningrad. In addition, Novorossiysk in the lower reaches of the Kuban River in western North Caucasus is set as the front line. The characteristics of the above-mentioned front line form are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The southern front line up to Kharkov has regained the areas recovered by the Soviet Union in the winter war, returning to its original position at the end of last winter.</p>
<p>(2) The Rzhev, Vyazma, and Kursk areas have been abandoned, and the front line in that area at the end of last winter has changed.</p>
<p>The above two most noteworthy facts, from the east of Taganrog to the encirclement of Leningrad, the entire war zone is connected into a long line, and some parts have been strongly fortified. This fact gives a major hint in observing the future direction of Hitler's strategy, that is, any war zone can become a precursor to launching a major offensive.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the timing of launching a major offensive, a certain German newspaper stated:</p>
<p>"Various war materials have been fully prepared, and large corps and powerful reserve forces have already adopted both offensive and defensive postures, waiting for battle."</p>
<p>Judging from this, preparations have been completed, and the question of "when" depends entirely on the movements of the Red Army, or the state of Tunisia and other fronts around the world, as well as the operational direction and scale of the summer offensive, and will be decided by Hitler. It is certainly impossible to make a prophetic judgment, but at least the opportunity for war is maturing day by day. And because (1) the construction of powerful defensive fortresses in the west has been completed, (2) the equipment of new weapons in the eastern attack has been completed, and (3) the large-scale mobilization plan for the people of all Europe has been completed. Therefore, the future major offensive will undoubtedly be an unprecedented decisive battle in world history, implemented with an unprecedented scale and thorough preparation, not to mention surpassing the first and second summer offensives. The Third Reich's rise or fall depends on this battle. (翔: Translated from the Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi Newspaper, May 3rd)</p>
<h3>A Great Tragedy in World History (II)</h3>
<p>— Tokutomi Iichirō</p>
<p>Continued from the 6th of this newspaper</p>
<p>(II) Britain Without Ideals</p>
<p>Our Japan takes Hakkō ichiu as the foundation of our nation. In ancient Greece, there was Plato's ideal Republic, with philosophers in positions of power guiding the people as its ideal. In China, Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu ruled for the public good, and the Three Dynasties of Tang, Yu, and Xia were the epitome of politics. For thousands of years thereafter, they have been the standard. However, what political ideal does this so-called British Empire have? Not to mention the British Empire, what is the fundamental intention inherent in the British homeland itself for its nation?</p>
<p>In Britain, there are certainly works like Sir Thomas More's "Utopia," but that was originally an imitation of Plato's theories to satirize the government and society of the time, and had nothing to do with the actual politics of Britain.</p>
<p>If we were to investigate the beginning and end of Britain's rise and fall, we would be surprised by the lack of ideals among the British. They have no ideal or belief about why a country is a country. They simply accept the present as the present. If you insist on asking them to explain the reason, you will not get any answer other than saying that the country exists for the convenience of individuals. The British, from beginning to end, have no grand and fundamental ideal for the country; therefore, the country itself lacks a central force.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Saxons were originally a nation of common sense, a nation of reality. It is not that there is a fact after a theory, but that there is a theory after a fact; it is not that there is a thing after a rhetoric, but that there is a rhetoric after a thing. The so-called British constitution is not manufactured, but grown, that is, the reality itself, the natural growth of events. And what exactly is the so-called reality itself? As British historian Seeley said: "The British navy is almost like pirates. In Britain's eyes, war is a great business to get rich, a most profitable business, the most lucrative business, the most profitable investment." Therefore, they only flip somersaults for profit, thinking nothing, moving nothing, and doing nothing except for profit.</p>
<p>In short, the nature of pirates changes with time and place. This is like water, sometimes a trickle, sometimes a deep abyss, sometimes a rapid current, sometimes a great waterfall, sometimes the sea, but the water is still water and does not change; just like sometimes ice, sometimes warm water, sometimes cold water, it is still water; it is just that the pirate nature adapts to circumstances and changes in thousands of ways.</p>
<p>Having said that, it does not mean that Britain has no political theories. Not only does it have political theories, but in modern times, Britain can even be called the ancestral home of political theories. Indeed, almost every country regards Britain as a storehouse from which to purchase political theories wholesale. Although I am not a philosopher or a legal and political scientist, from a historical perspective, it is probably okay to say that British political theories are precisely the theoretical explanation of Britain's own face.</p>
<p>If we consider the British Empire to have started from the time of Elizabeth, then we can review the arguments of Bacon in that era. Bacon was a great philosopher of knowledge and investigation in Britain, and the founder of British empiricism. Everyone looks up to him as their ancestor. At the same time, he was also involved in actual politics. During the reign of James I, he was an important minister and was granted the title of Viscount. Although he tarnished his reputation due to corruption, no one can deny that he was a great ancestor of the British intellectual world.</p>
<p>Bacon was the founder of the pleasure theory in British ethics, and in politics, he was a thorough utilitarian. He said:</p>
<p>"No one can maintain health without exercise; the same is true of the country. Therefore, a war with true honor must be said to be a real exercise."</p>
<p>So he was a person who praised war. He also said:</p>
<p>"The country must be strong both on land and at sea. To become the king of the ocean is to manage the kingdom."</p>
<p>He also said.</p>
<p>"The monarch must be vigilant and not neglect the expansion of territory by neighboring countries, or the enrichment of the country through commerce, etc. The true meaning of diplomacy lies in obtaining a balance of power."</p>
<p>He also said:</p>
<p>Hobbes's theory is less a defense of the despotic Stuart dynasty than a defense of the Cromwellian presidential politics that replaced the Stuart dynasty at that time. Why? Because his argument is more a submission to the powerful at the time than an orthodox theory.</p>
<p>"The strength of one country is the reason for the weakness of another. One party gains, the other party must lose.</p>
<p>If we carefully examine the above words, what should be called the national policy of Britain? Hasn't the history of Britain for 350 years been as clear as pointing at the lines on the palm?</p>
<p>A person who can simply be called a disciple of Bacon, Hobbes, was once taught by Bacon. It is said that when he and others followed Bacon for a walk in the public garden, Bacon would tell his followers what he had in mind. He was the first to understand and comprehend Bacon's words and express them in writing. He also traveled all over Europe. In France, he was able to closely observe Duke Richelieu (A.J.D.Rishelieu), who was powerful at the time; in Italy, he met Galileo, who created the heliocentric theory. From this, we can know how rich and extensive his acquired knowledge was.</p>
<p>Hobbes's era spanned from the Puritan Revolution to the restoration of Charles II. He was actually the mathematics teacher of Charles II when he was the crown prince. His political theory is known to the world as contract theory. He said:</p>
<p>"When humans are first born into the world, their minds and bodies are mutually equal. Competition arises from equality, and war arises from competition. This war is not a war between groups and groups, but a war between people and people. For this reason, throughout the world, there is chaos and no production, no skills, no literature, and no social happiness, but only a continuous series of terror and danger. That is, life is lonely, poor, base, animalistic, and short-lived. Therefore, they agree with each other and choose one person as their leader, and the whole body obeys his orders. Only then do they get peace and security. Therefore, once they transfer their rights, no matter what stage they reach, they can no longer take them back. The so-called will of the monarch is the law, and his subjects can only do what the monarch does not prohibit."</p>
<p>However, Hobbes's contract theory was completely misused by Locke. Locke's father was a Puritan soldier and a successor to the tradition of contract theory. Locke was a scholar and a man of the world. His "Essay Concerning Human Understanding" is a very famous book in the world. Among the British empiricist philosophers, he can be regarded as one of the giants. His views are completely opposite to those of Hobbes. His so-called state of nature is not a battlefield of Shura like Hobbes said. According to him, the natural state of mankind is:</p>
<p>"Mankind is not in a state of war in which people fight each other, but in a state of peace in which people help each other with good intentions. However, for the sake of safety and permanence of this state, they enter into contracts with each other according to their own will. Therefore, once this contract is established, it must of course be obeyed. However, if the monarch violates this contract, it is only natural to resist and re-elect someone who can implement this contract."</p>
<p>This passage of his can be seen as a defense of the Revolution of 1688 - that is, the exile of James II and the welcoming back of William of Orange and his wife Mary from the Netherlands. Moreover, he even went straight into the enemy's camp, seized his spear, and reversed Hobbes's theory, which was established for despotism, to establish the fundamental righteousness of liberalism. In his eyes, he does not recognize the existence of a system called the state, but only regards the state as an aggregate of individuals. Its purpose is to uphold common convenience within an extremely limited scope; all rights are inherent to each individual. In this way, the country is just like a limited liability joint-stock company.</p>
<p>We are not discussing the right or wrong of this theory now. However, Locke's social contract theory describes the British concept of the state without missing a single detail. This point needs to be especially emphasized here. In short, Hobbes, like Xunzi, started from the theory of the inherent evil of human nature; Locke, like Mencius, started from the theory of the inherent goodness of human nature. And just like Mencius's recognition of the right to revolution, Locke also recognizes the right to revolution. But the similarities stop there. As for the fact that Locke completely regards politics as a commercial company, while Mencius regards politics as the practice of the highest ideal, the two are completely different.</p>
<p>How did British political theory affect other countries? Anyone who is familiar with European history knows this. Where did the French Montesquieu, Voltaire, and Rousseau and his followers get their ideas? What yeast did they get their ideas from? Where did the three principles of freedom, equality, and fraternity in the French Declaration of Revolution originate? The British social contract theory became the American Declaration of Independence in the United States: it was transferred to France and became the declaration of the French Revolution. Whether directly or indirectly, the ancestral home must be said to be Britain.</p>
<p>Edmund Burke vehemently criticized the French Revolution. Perhaps he remembered that the principles of French revolutionary theory were almost all imported from Britain!</p>
<p>Hume's theory of pleasure, Bentham, the Mills' utilitarianism, and Spencer's social equilibrium theory, which incorporates some physics or biology's theory of evolution, have not transcended the scope of individualism, liberalism, and hedonism. When these three principles are held high and rampant, how can a country not fall into decline? Now, the giant of the British Empire is entangled in these three principles and is struggling in a sick bed to recover! (丁: Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun, April 29th)</p>

<h3>Authorities Plan to Select Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate Hoarding Again; Personnel Can Be Assigned to Shanghai by the End of This Week; Strict Investigation Will Be Conducted According to Previous Policies</h3>
<p>In order to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihood, the government authorities are still strictly handling the issue of thoroughly investigating merchants in Shanghai who hoard goods. They are now planning to send personnel to Shanghai to conduct a second thorough investigation. The economic circles and citizens of this city are eagerly awaiting this. According to a Central News Agency reporter's inquiry to the relevant authorities, the authorities can assign the second thorough investigation personnel to Shanghai by the end of this week. The investigation will still be carried out according to previous policies.

<p>It is heard that Mr. Wen Lanting is seventy-four years old this year. He is usually devoted to social undertakings, and his strength increases with age, which is deeply admired. However, at the end of last year, he fell ill due to overwork, and his energy has not yet recovered after the illness. Colleagues are deeply troubled that Mr. Lan's evening social engagements and conversations are time-consuming and energy-draining, so they advised him to decline evening banquets and rest early to increase his energy and use it for social undertakings, which would be beneficial to both. Mr. Lan agreed with this. Therefore, colleagues respectfully inform Mr. Lan's relatives and old friends on his behalf that they should not invite him to dinner parties or visit him in the evening from today onwards. Your understanding is appreciated.</p>

<h3>Japanese Embassy Minister Guang Tian Criticizes Another Meeting Between Luo and Qiu</h3>
<p>Guang Tian, Information Minister of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office, held a regular meeting with the local Chinese journalist corps at the Hua Mao Hotel on the eighth floor at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 12th). He provided a detailed critique of British Prime Minister Churchill's visit to Washington, D.C. on the 11th, accompanied by key British political figures and important personnel from the army, navy, and air force, to meet with U.S. President Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Another Meeting</p>
<p>Minister Guang Tian first stated: "Regarding British Prime Minister Churchill's trip to Washington, D.C. to meet with U.S. President Roosevelt, its significance is worthy of consideration. Churchill and Roosevelt held talks in Casablanca at the end of January of this year. Less than four months have passed, and they are meeting again. The main reason is that the UK and the U.S. have many issues that urgently need to be resolved. The operational guidelines decided at the Luo-Qiu meeting at the end of January were not satisfactory, and there are many areas that need to be revised. At the same time, the diplomatic relations between the UK and the U.S. on the anti-Axis side are not satisfactory, and the relationship between the UK and the Soviet Union is delicate. In addition, relations with Chongqing have not progressed smoothly. Other issues such as Poland, Australia, and Arabia remain unresolved. Even domestic problems in the UK and the U.S., such as strikes in the U.S., coal mines being shut down, and the lack of military supplies and consumer goods, urgently need to be addressed and production increased. Therefore, these issues urgently need to be discussed and resolved. The UK previously sent Foreign Secretary Eden to the U.S. to conduct activities. Recently, the news of former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Davis, going to the Soviet Union to negotiate has been released. However, because the issues are broad and serious, it is difficult to resolve them. As a result, Churchill himself went to the U.S. again to meet with Roosevelt and discuss and determine guidelines to improve the situation and resolve the various difficulties. Therefore, we can all imagine the purpose of this meeting."</p>
<p>What is the Significance?</p>
<p>"The resolution of various military and political outstanding issues during Churchill's visit to the U.S. will be announced in the future, which we can say for certain. However, regardless of the conclusions reached by the UK and the U.S. at this meeting, because the war aims of the UK and the U.S. are completely contrary to justice and it is difficult to change their war aims, this is a fundamental error in political direction. Therefore, no matter how many times they announce improvements, we firmly believe that they will not produce conclusions that are beneficial to all mankind. Even if they make corrections, it will be difficult to gain an advantage in the Greater East Asia War. The root of our war effort is based on adhering to the spirit of war morality, sacrificing lives, being loyal and brave, and strengthening our belief in war. Therefore, in terms of war power, the Axis powers have long been superior to the anti-Axis nations in the European and Pacific theaters. The facts are all there, and there is no need to repeat them. Therefore, no matter what the conclusions of their meeting are, they will not shake our belief in final victory. Furthermore, at this meeting, the Soviet Union's Stalin and Chongqing's Chiang Kai-shek were not invited to participate. From this, it can be seen that there is no unity among the anti-Axis nations, and it gives us the impression that they will definitely not be able to exert any strength. In short, this kind of meeting has no special value," he said, and gave a detailed explanation of the problems in North Africa and other issues.</p>
<p>Comments from the Economic Sector</p>
<h3>After the Resumption of Business by Chinese-Owned Stock Firms</h3>
<p>In our April 29th article on "The Resumption of Business by Chinese-Owned Stock Firms," we believed that the authorities' review and registration of Chinese-owned stock firms was indeed another wise measure, but it needed to be implemented quickly. Now, Chinese-owned stock firms that have obtained licenses have already been unsealed and have resumed business immediately.</p>
<p>Therefore, we feel that under the current policy of strictly suppressing prices, it is necessary to pay close attention to any market that is related to prices. Therefore, taking a broad approach, the authorities have sent personnel to thoroughly investigate and examine warehouse inventories. To curb speculation, the authorities have restricted loans and proposed the merger of small banks. At the same time, we feel that an interesting question deserves to be studied and judged: Why are prices rising? Why are stock prices rising?</p>
<p>The main reason for rising prices is hoarding and speculation, which creates a panic among the people about the future lack of goods. The main reason for rising stock prices, in general, is the increase in the value of corporate assets, which strengthens investment. The main reasons for rising prices and rising stock prices are completely different. Furthermore, in fact, prices in Japan are strictly controlled, but the stock market is still moving forward in normal development, and the issuance of stocks has been increasing year by year for several years. This shows that the restriction of prices has not prevented the rise in stock prices, and the rise in stock prices has not affected the increase in prices. Therefore, we might as well come to a conclusion: the stock market is a capital market, which is different from the commodity market; the stock price represents the value of corporate assets, which is different from prices.</p>
<p>Based on this point of view, we must hope that after the resumption of business by Chinese-owned stock firms, they will work together to promote the normal development of the Chinese stock market. Normal development means jointly seeking a solid foundation and jointly planning for gradual growth, so as to avoid sudden rises and falls, causing the stock price to rise and fall sharply, and causing the public to have a negative psychological impact on enterprises and stocks.</p>
<p>In a sound organization and normal development, the Chinese stock market will inevitably become the only garden for public investment. This is what we dare to assert.</p>
<h3>Zhang Jinhai Case: Municipal Government Receives Reply from French Consul General - Minister Chu's Remarks State that Negotiations are Nearing Conclusion - French Consular Court Reopens Trial Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Chinese suspects in the Zhang Jinhai tragedy were all transferred from the French General Affairs Office to the court the night before last and detained in the Second Special District Prison. They are being held as detainees awaiting trial. It is heard that the court will hold a public trial in the coming days based on the appeal filed by the police. The main culprit, Miller, was prosecuted by the French Consular Court, and the French Consular Court reopened the trial yesterday morning. Li Xiuying, Li Hongkui, Zhu Songcheng, and Yihua Laundry Company employees Feng Quansheng and Zhang Yuebo, who were in custody, were summoned to court for trial. It is expected that the entire case can be finalized in the short term. The Second Special District Court, in order to effectively protect human rights, sent a letter to the French Consul General stating that any case involving suspects should be delivered to the court by the French police within 24 hours in accordance with the agreement. The details have been published in the newspapers. It is now learned that if there are any violations or delays, a complaint can be filed with the Second Special District Court, which will directly interrogate the suspect based on its authority.</p>
<p>Minister Chu's Remarks</p>
<p>Minister Chu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made the following remarks yesterday regarding the Zhang Jinhai beating death case: "The Zhang Jinhai case involves the death of a police officer due to torture, which is very clear. Since the incident occurred, people from all walks of life have spoken out righteously and appealed in unison, which shows the deep concern of the people. I and Mayor Chen have repeatedly negotiated with the French Embassy and the Shanghai Consulate General. Regarding the punishment of the murderer, the French Consul General has prosecuted the head of the police force, Miller, in the Consular Court in accordance with the law, and the Chinese detectives and related persons are being prosecuted by the French police in the Second Special District Court. Regarding compensation, a pension of 100,000 yuan has been promised. Regarding the apology, in addition to meeting in person and making remarks, there is also a reply to the municipal government's protest. Regarding the guarantee of future conduct, police officers have been strictly ordered not to engage in brutal conduct, and this order has been issued for eight days. Therefore, the negotiations are nearing conclusion, and we will only wait for the judicial proceedings. Since this case occurred, the central and local governments have paid close attention to the protection of the people's lives and the illegal conduct of the police force, and have handled it in accordance with diplomatic procedures. I am now publicly announcing the progress of the case to comfort the expectations of the people and hope that lessons will be learned and that no more unfortunate incidents will occur in Shanghai."</p>
<p>Reply from the French Consul General</p>
<p>Regarding the Zhang Jinhai beating death case, the Shanghai Municipal Government previously protested to the French Consulate General. It is now learned that the French Consulate General has sent a reply to the municipal government. The original text is transcribed below: "In response to your letter No. 5199 dated the 8th of this month, we have received it. It is found that Zhang Jinhai was accused by a woman named Li of embezzling lost property and was taken to the Central Police Station for investigation on the afternoon of April 29th. The next morning, Zhang Jinhai's physical condition was serious, and he was immediately sent to the hospital. However, the doctor on duty found that he had died. As his death was suspicious, the head of the Detective Department of the French Police immediately notified the Chinese court prosecutor in writing in accordance with the Sino-French Agreement of July 28, 1931. On the same day, in the presence of personnel from the Prosecutor's Office and Chinese forensic doctors, as well as Peng Shuanglong and other co-suspects brought in by the French Police at the request of the Prosecutor, Zhang Jinhai was found to have died violently. On the following day, the post-mortem examination revealed the possibility of violent acts causing spleen rupture. Upon receiving the report of the Commissioner of Police of the French Concession regarding these facts, this Consul General quickly approved the Commissioner of Police's request and ordered the President of this Consulate Court to investigate the case. The President of the Court considered that Detective Miller had committed a criminal act, so he ordered his detention and transfer to the Criminal Court for trial to answer for his actions. The Chinese detectives related to this case have been handed over to the Chinese court for trial. The French authorities, whenever they encounter suspicious and reprehensible behavior, will ensure that the judicial authorities have a way to shed light on the matter, so that the facts can be revealed and the criminals can be punished. The French administrative authorities will compensate the victim for his losses. This Consul General has also instructed the Commissioner of Police to strictly reiterate the long-standing ban on violence, which was unfortunately violated by the imprudent detective in this case. This Consul General need not reiterate to Your Mayor how regrettable he is about this matter. This letter is addressed to Mayor Chen of Shanghai Special Municipality. Sincerely, Mager Le, May 12, 32nd year of the Republic of China."</p>

<h3>Non-Association Member Companies and Firms May Not Buy or Sell Major Commodities</h3>
<p>The list of major commodities of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce was approved by the 158th meeting of the Executive Yuan and has been published in the newspaper by the Ministry. However, the general public is unclear about whether all 18 designated major commodities are subject to control, and whether they need to apply to the Commercial Control Committee for permission when moving them in and out of the Shanghai area. A reporter from the Central News Agency inquired with the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday. The person in charge replied:</p>
<p>"The commodities that are subject to control and require permission from the Commercial Control Committee are still limited to the items stipulated in Article 6 of the Provisional Regulations for the Suppression of Wartime Material Movement, that is, those transported from the</p>
<p>Shanghai area</p>
<p>(that is, within the control line established around Shanghai) to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces and Shanghai and Nanjing special municipalities, including (1) various automobiles and their parts, (2) gasoline and petroleum products for automobiles, (3) various machinery, (4) communication equipment materials (including parts) and batteries, (5) metals (including silver raw materials, non-ferrous metals and their products), (6) medicines (referring to medical and industrial use, excluding Chinese medicine) and dyes, (7) rubber (including old rubber) and products, (8) cotton yarn and common products, (9) candles (including raw materials), (10) matches, (11) soap, (12) sugar, transported from</p>
<p>Three provinces and two cities</p>
<p>to the Shanghai area. (1) Rice (excluding glutinous rice), wheat, wheat flour, beans, (2) cotton. The movement permits for the above materials can be applied for from the Material Movement Permit Office of the National Commercial Control Association. As for the 18 major commodities under the Ministry's jurisdiction, except for those stipulated in the Provisional Regulations for the Suppression of Wartime Material Movement, there is no need to apply for import and export permits. However, in order to facilitate purchase and allocation, companies and firms engaged in major commodities must join the trade association. In other words, companies and firms that do not join the major commodities trade association may not buy or sell major commodities." Merchants can fully understand this explanation.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Announces Major Commodity Registration Rules</h3>
<p>Article 9 of the National Government's promulgated Regulations for the Punishment of Hoarding Major Commodities clearly stipulates that major commodities must be registered, and Article 3 clearly stipulates the criminal penalties for those who fail to perform the statutory registration procedures. After the promulgation of the regulations, the National Government, with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce as the center, studied the registration rules for major commodities. A proposal has now been finalized and promulgated by the Ministry on May 11. These rules can be regarded as a partial detailed rule of the Regulations for the Punishment of Hoarding Major Commodities. Article 2 of the registration rules explains "major commodities," Article 3 stipulates the registration obligations (details in the article), Article 4 stipulates the registration procedures and registration items. Item 3 of the original article clearly states that the "source of the commodity, and the time and value of its acquisition" must be registered. There are a total of eight registration items, which seem to be comprehensive. Article 5 stipulates the beneficial obligations between the trade association and its members. Article 9 specifically stipulates: "The competent authority may send personnel to inspect warehouses and companies and firms at any time for the inventory of major commodities." After the implementation of these rules, not only is the government's determination to crack down on hoarding visible, but the subsidiary rules of the Major Commodity Hoarding Regulations are also complete.</p>
<h3>Silk Cocoon Merchants to Depart - To Purchase Spring Cocoons</h3>
<p>Spring cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are about to enter the market. Silk manufacturers and cocoon merchants have borrowed spring cocoon loans from silver firms. They will send personnel to the rented cocoon market to prepare from the day after tomorrow. Once spring cocoons are on the market, they will start weighing, and the prices will be based on the standard decided by the Spring Cocoon Evaluation Association of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. It is heard that the cocoons purchased are allowed to be transported freely, but only within the peaceful areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. Therefore, factories in the Shanghai Concession area have all started preparations and will start silk reeling as soon as the spring cocoons are transported. However, a bumper harvest of spring cocoons is expected this year. Due to the relationship between mulberry trees, the output is lower than in previous years. The Spring Cocoon Evaluation Conference is scheduled to be held on the 15th, and a public announcement will be made after the decision.</p>
<h3>Fifteen Chinese Stock Firms - Approved to Resume Business Next Wednesday</h3>

After these fifteen Chinese stock firms obtained their licenses, the Public Works Department sent personnel to unseal them. It is learned that after the unsealing, these fifteen Chinese stock companies are now preparing all the resumption procedures and are scheduled to officially resume business next Wednesday (the 19th). A verification fee of five ten-thousandths will be levied on the sale of entrusted stocks, and stocks registered with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will be allowed to be traded on the market.</p>
<h3>Oil Industry in This City Starts - Establishing Oil Factories in the Interior - Lu Xingsen and Fu Ronghao from the Oil Industry in This City</h3>

<h3>Japanese-Side China Branch Flour Milling Federation - Will Loan Money to Buy Wheat</h3>
<p>The wheat production in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is quite large. In the past, Japanese merchants monopolized the purchase alone. Since the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association, the purchasing mechanism has changed. The "Flour Professional Committee" has also been officially established under the Commercial Control Association. It is learned that the "China Branch Flour Milling Federation" is under the professional committee system. It is now learned that the "China Branch Flour Milling Federation" is preparing to purchase a large amount of wheat and is discussing borrowing money from six Japanese banks, including Zhengjin, Taiwan, Korea, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, and Huaxing Bank. The total amount will exceed 460 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Begins Exchanging Military Currency</h3>
<p>After the Hong Kong Governor's Office announced that the use of Hong Kong dollars would be prohibited in the jurisdiction from June 1st, it designated nine banks as temporary military currency exchange offices and began handling the exchange of Hong Kong dollars and military currency. As the circulation of military currency has become widespread in all classes, and many Chinese laborers directly exchange military currency, the exchange situation on the first day was quite good. In addition, Chinese banks, which have always been popular with small merchants, have been handling both military currency and Hong Kong dollar savings. Based on this order, all previous Hong Kong dollar savings must be converted to military currency by the end of May.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>

Because the procedures have not yet been completed, the meeting has been rescheduled to be held at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce today.</p>
<h3>Strengthening the National Government and the Hoarding Problem (5)</h3>
<p>What is Expected of the Commercial Control Association</p>
<p>In order to win the Greater East Asia War, a new economic policy was decided. First, the National Commercial Control Association was established, and then subordinate institutions were established. The low-price policy will also be implemented. At this time of innovation and reform, if the members of the industrial and commercial trade associations under the Commercial Control Association have behaviors of hoarding materials and seeking windfall profits, then the new economic policy will obviously be trampled by these people. Their crimes are unforgivable. The cry for the National Government to thoroughly solve the hoarding problem is nothing less than the call for the Commercial Control Association to implement its policies.</p>
<p>The low-price policy can be said to be one of the important policies in the new economic policy. The direction of the Commercial Control Association is nothing more than to promote the exchange of materials with the interior, so as to advance the low-price policy. However, there are still many difficulties in its future. Last time, Mr. Pan Yangyao, the planning director of the China Industrial Bank, expressed his opinion on this. He believes that the implementation of the low-price policy requires the determination and perseverance of the National Government and the Commercial Control Association. The price limit for cotton yarn is 5,500 yuan, and the price limit for its raw material, cotton, is 1,150 yuan. This price is too cheap, and the market refuses to trade at this price limit and buys and sells in the black market.</p>
<p>If this actual situation is not taken into account, simply setting the prices of raw materials and products very low will only help black market transactions, and other prices will also increase. The profit-seeking nature of commercial capital has hindered the low-price policy. Therefore, the National Government must take drastic measures against all those who hinder the low-price policy. Only then will the commercial opportunities under the guidance of the National Government be able to maintain the low-price policy, purchase raw materials, and supply products. Therefore, the National Government's responsibility is very heavy and huge. In order to complete this arduous responsibility, the National Government should have a tragic determination. The current and future problems of the Commercial Control Association will be discussed on another occasion. Here, we will only talk about the expectations of the National Government and the Commercial Control Association regarding the request to solve the hoarding problem.

<h3>On Adjusting the Political and Economic Structure of Shanghai</h3>
<p>With the abolition of extraterritoriality, the adjustment of Shanghai's political and economic structures has become a matter of great concern to both Chinese and Japanese sides. In particular, the unified adjustment of the National Government's agencies stationed in Shanghai and the Special Municipal Government has become an important issue. This adjustment issue did not start today. For example, the relationship between the former Social Movement Guidance Committee and the former Social Affairs Bureau, the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry, the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance, and the current Economic Bureau urgently needs adjustment. Furthermore, in terms of strengthening the Municipal Government, unifying the guidance of the new economic policies, and preparing for the reorganization of Shanghai after the abolition of extraterritoriality, there is a need for immediate adjustment. However, the reality is contrary to the path of unified adjustment, so all parties are deeply concerned.</p>
<p>It is found that half a year ago, there were about forty agencies of the National Government stationed in Shanghai, and recently, due to additions, the number is about seventy. According to their original mission, they were to serve as liaison between the National Government and the Municipal Government, or Shanghai's financial circles. However, at present, they have gone beyond their scope and become special practical activity agencies. Their activities and work hinder the strengthening and development of the Municipal Government.</p>
<p>Regarding the above issues, summarizing the opinions of various circles in the concessions, the general idea is as follows:</p>
<p>Since the incident, the normal development of various circles in the concessions has been limited due to various complex guidance and supervision. After the Greater East Asia War, the political and economic forces of Britain and the United States have been completely eliminated. Moreover, after Japan declared the abolition of extraterritoriality, the direction of accepting the unified guidance and supervision of the National Government has long been established. Diplomatic and special central finance matters should be discussed separately. Other departments urgently need reform. The National Government and the Municipal Government should not provide guidance and supervision in two separate ways. The National Government should guide and supervise the Municipal Government, and the Municipal Government should directly guide and supervise Shanghai's political, economic, and cultural affairs. This aligns with the truth. The outside world believes that the current Municipal Government bears such a significant mission, but its structure and talent are still inadequate. Given this inadequacy, appropriate measures should be taken to make it a powerful institution. While considering such measures, the presence of agencies of various departments of the Executive Yuan stationed in Shanghai borders on excessiveness. For the sake of Shanghai's future, this is not optimistic. Furthermore, there is a lack of communication between the various agencies stationed in Shanghai, which may lead to the growth of factional political forces. Now may be the best time for the National Government to establish a big municipal government ideology or even a municipal government-centered ideology. An urgent adjustment and unified guidance are deeply desired by all parties. (Yun Peng: Translated from the May 12th Continental New Report)</p>

<h3>Facts Speak Louder Than Words</h3>
<p>— Ling Zuren</p>
<p>Saying a word is certainly much easier than doing something, and "speaking" is not as strenuous or as easily marked as doing something. No wonder many people are always just saying irresponsible things.</p>
<p>Listening to them speak, it is truly mesmerizing, making the listener feel how great they are! No matter how important the matter, they seem to be able to handle it with ease, and even the work of transforming the world can be achieved without much effort. However, if we coldly observe their actions, it is not so. They either speak without acting, or act without thoroughness. Their words and actions never seem to be consistent.</p>
<p>If a person deceives others with "words," it only means that people are temporarily deceived by them once. But if they permanently deceive themselves with such "inconsistent words and actions," what kind of person do they become?</p>
<p>Although we don't necessarily have to be like those great figures, whose words have a certain value and power, I believe that if you don't want to become someone who deceives themselves, then we should absolutely respect our words, and we should do what we say. If you feel that you are not sure of success in a matter, I advise you not to say it. Because if you say it but can't do it, you become a boaster.</p>
<p>Often, a person who silently and diligently works with their head down achieves much more quickly than those who habitually exaggerate.</p>
<p>Expressing our strength through facts is the most powerful way to express ourselves in life. Facts always speak louder than eloquence!</p>
<p>In short, we should closely and carefully assess our strength in any matter, and we must achieve credibility in our words and always do what we say.</p>
<h3>Extraordinary Bubbles</h3>
<p>— Guo Minzhi</p>
<p>The most important industry using bubbles is the bakery. They use yeast to create air bubbles, and carefully study the hardness of barley, in order to make the finished product filled with evenly distributed small holes. Unleavened bread is simply difficult to swallow, and the best bread is light in quality and fully leavened. Therefore, bakers all use a fast-acting yeast that can generate enough gas in ordinary flour, forming extremely small voids.</p>
<p>The next largest-scale bubble industry is mining. For example, the extraction methods for sulfur and silicon ore involve first grinding the ore into powder, and then finding ways to separate the minerals from the impurities. Sulfur easily adheres to certain oils, while sand is easily permeable to water. Utilizing these characteristics, each ton of ore is mixed with four to five tons of water to form a slurry. About twenty pounds of special oil are then added, and the mixture is vigorously stirred until a thick layer of bubbles forms on the surface. The outer membrane of these bubbles is the oil that was initially added, and it absorbs many fine particles of sulfur, forming a slightly sticky foam that is lighter and floats on the surface. Silicon does not mix with the oil and is permeable to water, so it sinks to the bottom. This method is the most economical and simple, and can be used to analyze many ores with extremely low content.</p>
<p>Foam also greatly helps modern firefighting techniques. The so-called "fire extinguishing foam" is actually a large amount of carbon dioxide foam, which is generated by the chemical reaction of lead sulfate and sodium carbonate. If a large amount of foam is sprayed onto burning oils, even gasoline, it can float on the flames, isolating the air and stopping the combustion.</p>
<p>Modern fire brigades are mostly equipped with portable foam sprayers, which are only the size of ordinary luggage, but contain highly compressed air that can forcefully spray the chemicals, forming a fixed and suffocating foam. Whenever encountering fires involving oils or chemical products that cannot be effectively extinguished with water and yellow sand, they must be used.</p>
<p>Beer, which is popular all over the world, is also a bubble product. Beer, ginger ale, ale, and flavored wines all produce foam. Some of these foams are very durable, while others disappear quickly.</p>
<p>Floating soap is also one of the industries that utilize foam. When manufacturing it, they ensure that it contains a large amount of small, uniform air bubbles during solidification, reducing its specific gravity, so that it naturally floats in water. Ice cream also cannot be made without foam. If it is not stirred enough, it will solidify into a hard block of ice.</p>
<p>There is also a very strange effect, which is the formation of color. There is no blue pigment in the feathers of birds. But how do parrots and peacocks have such bright blue feathers? Originally, their blue feathers are made up of many transparent horny bubbles. Furthermore, they have a black background that absorbs all the light. Only the shortest blue and purple light waves are reflected, thus revealing a beautiful blue or purple color.</p>
<p>The white fur of beasts also does not have white pigment. It is also composed of countless extremely fine air bubbles. These air bubbles are all transparent, so all the light can be refracted by it, presenting a pure white color. However, human white hair is completely different from them. The cause of white hair is due to changes in the body, which lead to a lack of black pigment and an abundance of white pigment in the chemical composition of the hair. Of course, it will be "streaked with white at the temples."</p>
<h3>Reader's Notes</h3>
<p>— Qing Zhao</p>
<p>One can abandon ambition for everything; but ambition for knowledge must be eternal.</p>
<p>"Friends and truth are both loved by us, but if friends endanger the truth, we should abandon friends and take truth."</p>
<p>In Balzac's works, there are many "aphorisms," which, when viewed today, have even more realistic meaning:</p>
<p>—I am a worldly man, I fear God, but I fear the hell of poverty even more! Being penniless is the final stage of misfortune in our current social system. I am a man of my time, I worship money!</p>
<p>—Egypt borrowed a lot of money from the Hebrews, they were not following the people of God; but following capital!</p>
<p>The former exposes the inner secrets of worshipers of money; the latter illustrates the general phenomenon of "people following money" in capitalist society</p>
<p>Everything has its own inherent value, exceeding the limit, it will turn "reasonable into absurd; kindness into disaster"</p>
<p>Silence is not negative; it is a necessary attitude for further understanding the truth of things.</p>
<p>Recollection is not necessarily "the obsession with remnants"; if you feel that you must seek your historical position and lessons from memory.</p>
<h3>Words of Consideration</h3>
<p>— Meng Ling</p>
<p>Perhaps you have never thought that you want "face" and others want "face"! Therefore, many unfortunate things happen where people are embarrassed and unaware.</p>
<p>Preserving "face" for others is an important method for us to get along with people, but people often give unacceptable accusations, teachings, and reproaches for a small mistake of others, and even, in order to show their own righteousness, they publicly criticize and scold in front of the public, tearing apart the face of others, making them unable to face people again...</p>
<p>In fact, this is a selfish behavior, although your intention "may" be good, to persuade people to correct their mistakes, but when you do this, the good intention becomes malice, not to mention that your words have already become "pouring dog blood" on them.</p>
<h3>Luck</h3>
<p>— Wei Huan</p>
<p>"Luck" can lead a promising "life" to the "evil path." Because often a gambler, although he knows that the casino boss will never lose money, but the reason why he wants to do this is nothing more than the influence of "luck." He thinks: What if I'm lucky and get rich? So he lingers in the casino, happily forgetting to return, and finally goes bankrupt and becomes a beggar. A promising life ends here. Furthermore, observe the thieves who rob or steal money. Don't they know that this will violate the law and put them in prison? But why do they knowingly violate it? This is also caused by "luck."... Therefore, luck is the destroyer of the path to success in life.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people want to retort and say: Aren't scientists from ancient times to the present also successful through "luck"? For example, the famous "Archimedes' principle" was not thought of by Archimedes in the bathroom when he saw the bathwater overflowing? Is thinking of a principle while bathing not "luck"? And Newton discovered "gravity" because he saw an apple falling, which is even more "luck." As for Watt's invention of the steam engine, it was invented because the water in a teapot boiled and lifted the teapot lid, which is even more strange. "Luck" within "luck."... However, try to think calmly, before them, I don't know how many servants in the bathroom, gardeners in the garden, and servants in the kitchen, why didn't they invent it? Must it be invented by scientists?</p>
<p>You must know that they have kept the problems they want to solve in their hearts for a long time, thinking about them anytime and anywhere. Therefore, once they encounter a hint, they will feel enlightened and become a great man. If we aspire to be a great man, this spirit of keeping the things we study in our hearts for a long time and thinking about them anytime and anywhere is something we should imitate! To implement!</p>
<p>In short, luck can lead life to the evil path. Therefore, if we want to have a bright and splendid life, we should not let luck linger in our hearts, thinking about it all the time.</p>
<p>Therefore, persuading people also requires art. Since your intention comes from the bottom of your heart, you should achieve your goal, which is a help to others and a merit to yourself.</p>
<p>Other things should be straightforward and quick, and use blitzkrieg tactics. However, persuading people must be roundabout, comprehensive, and use distant friendship and close attack, and transplanting flowers and trees, because it is not easy for everyone to say "yes" after listening to your words and to "correct their mistakes."</p>
<p>I think that when persuading people, you should take it step by step. You may wish to first praise their strengths, and use sincerity as a prelude. Then you may as well say "I myself have made this mistake before, and only corrected it later." Then you may as well use suggestive methods, so as not to be hated by the persuadee. Some people are stubborn and unrepentant. Then you may wish to use consultation instead of orders, maintain his face, and then say how hopeful the future will be if he can correct his mistakes. Persuading in this way, I believe that in the end, they will be happy to accept your advice, then your purpose can be achieved.</p>
<p>In the current chaotic world, even if you don't persuade people, it seems that you should be careful in your words! Otherwise, the consequences will be endless, right?</p>
<h3>Random Notes</h3>
<p>— Qian Fu</p>
<p>Worry and anger are most harmful to the body and mind. Those who want to cultivate their body and mind should start by restraining worry and anger.</p>
<p>People's daily encounters in life are good materials for forming knowledge, thoughts, and worldviews.</p>
<p>When you feel ignorant, lonely, and unbearable without noble confidantes to talk to, you can read some biographies of famous people or books of maxims, which can make up for this deficiency.</p>
<p>Some trees are very small, but they bear many very sweet fruits; some trees are large, but they bear few small fruits, or even no fruits at all. Therefore, whether a person bears fruit, or how many good or bad fruits they bear, does not depend on high or low position, talent, or amount of knowledge, but on the quality of their character.

<h3>Thrift to Aid the Poor: Mr. Gan Dounan Generously Donates 5,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Mr. Gan Dounan, manager of Lixing Thermos Factory, wrote: "In recent years, after the calamities of war, there are wounds everywhere.
