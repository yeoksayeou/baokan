<h3>助學最善—推廣助學金運動</h3>
<p>助學金運動，是最切合我國國情的一種運動，其最重要的意義，是由社會上的有心人和有力者，資助廣大的失學靑年，使有進修學業而成爲社會有用的人材，以社會的力量，培養社會的人材，改造和建設幸福的社會。</p>
<p>中國是　　。的國家，所以在歷史上雖然曾　是最大的文明古國，對於人類文化，有過很大的貢獻。但是目前和並世列强相較，却不免有樣樣落後之感。推求其原因，雖然很多，最中要的，就在於文化水準的低落，全國四億八千萬人民，識字的人數不足百分之二十，試想一國人口的百分之八十以上都是文盲，那麼無論如何努力，要求國家之强盛，是辦不到的。然而進一步請問爲什麼中國有這樣多的文盲呢？主要的原因就是廣大的學齡兒童和靑年沒有能力求學。而所以然者，一方面是因爲中國歷年紛亂，政局不　，軍，政，黨費，佔了預算中的極大部份，政府更無餘力以扶助文化敎育事業。另一。方面，則由於社會組織不健全，沒有把掃除文盲發展文化敎育作爲最里要最榮譽的社會事業。所以，現在我們不講愛國則已，如果不求社會進步則已；不然，就首先應該用政府和社會兩方面的力量，致力於淸除全國文盲和培植人才的工作。而這種工作中最主要的一項，就是大家出力出資，使無力求學的兒童少年和靑年們，都有升學深造的機會。我們要明白，家一切良好的政策，社會一切優良的制度，最緊要的是要依靠有人去執行，去辦理，所以淸除文盲，培養人材，是目前一切愛護　家社會人士最車要最根本和最光榮的任務。本報所以不自揣量，偶導助學令運動，就是爲此。</p>
<p>助學金運動是一件目中國最　切也最光榮。事業，決不是一舉手一投足之　所　完成，更不是少數個人與團體的努力所能建成的，在我國歷史上，不少熱心公益的偉人，捐產助學，代不　書，古來多少大政治家。人學問家，多少爲國家社會　功立業的人材，都由寒士受惠而成，飲水思源，未有不感激於助學之人的，所以朝任有獎　的盛典，民間有崇德的令譽，世相傳，以爲美德。不過從前助學，是無組織無計　的個人行動，此伏彼起，對於國家社會的貢獻還太小，現在我們要澈底掃除文盲，培植人材，便靠社會各界熱心人士，大家廣開助學競賽運動，人人以參加助要爲榮譽，雖所助之數目不問多寡，總期大家盡其對社會的天職。一般富裕人士，更宜以助金最多植材最　爲最大光榮，人人不願落後，　成一種風氣，那麼，不　國家社會受其　　，　參加者本人也就留芳萬代，正是對子孫最偉大最光榮的遺產。</p>
<p>本報創辦助學金以來＋，　到許多熱心人士，或捐薪，或變產，其間無分男女老幼，那種熱烈的過緒，　使同人　爲之感激流涕。誰說中國人心已死！誰說好事難做。我們　到各界熱烈捐款助學的情形，使我們對我國家民族的前途，增加了無限的興奮相樂觀，我們特在這　替捐助　君子，爲國家社會致最摯誠的敬意。我們更望社會上　有史大多數有資產有　位的人士，來共享這種新時代的榮譽，來打破過去捐助的最過紀錄·同時，我們也熱誠希望小數的捐款，那怕一角一元，都是社會人士熱心的鐵　，都是中國前途光明的「定　，有這「定錢一的人愈多，將夾培養的人材就愈多　。</p>
<p>如上面所說，　學最　，必須成一時風氣。從我們辦理助學以來的經騐，如捐款人的踴躍，以及各學校各界給我們幫助的熱烈，更可證明更造成這種「助學最善」的風氣，並不是不可　。近來上海助率情緒，已漸高漲，如反英美協會的助學運動之踵起，　特別値得推崇，在這　天雨雪霏霏中，那位年高德劭的張一鵬老先生，不辭艱辛，親自負責督導，其熱心社會文化事業的精神，實在値得敬佩。然而，我們可以斷言，在偌大的一個上海，具有像張老先生這種熱烈爲善精神的人士，一定還很多，我們熱誠希望大家都挺身出來，或是出資助學，或是出力倡辦。我們更盼望上海殷富，乘此年節之際，各就一年贏餘，提出若干成，或就年節酬應，節省一部份，在「助學最善」的光輝之中，參加助學，協力培植良好子弟，蔚成優美的風氣，將來國家社會多添大量的人材，所收效果，眞是不可限量。</p>
<p>助學運動還需要小，中，大學和各種專門學校的當局努力參加，在自己學校內，多設助學金的學額，使社會上淸寒失學的子弟，多一個努力深造的機會。本來辦學不同其他任何事業，所以稱爲「神聖的事業一者，就在不從學校本身經濟上的得失着眼，而以完成國家社會「百年樹人」的大計爲主要目標。特別是在這困苦的新時代，我們國家民族和社會的未來，完全要寄托在我們的下一代，而我們本身就要大家都有自我犧牲的精神，不畏艱苦困難，去盡力培育下一代的人材。一方面從小學起，努力替國家社會消除文盲，一方面從各級學校多爲淸寒子弟設想，多多替國家社會培養人材。特別是在這時代，一般學校的收費，多有使中等以下的家庭不能勝任子弟敎育費的時候，我們只有盼望腎明的學校當局，多設助學名額，或行貸學辦法，協助社會上的助學金運動。本報在辦助學運動中，深獲各校的贊助；於感激之餘，更望全滬各級學校，聞風嚮起，爭先恐後，廣開求學之門，同襄樹人大計。</p>
<p>助學運動是目前中國人心最好的測騐。我們深信各方面都會在「助學最善」的光輝下踴躍參加，而不願自己落後的。</p>
<h3>日議會重開　東條首相演說　闡明施政方針　充實戰力確保前途勝利　對菲緬獨立有重大啟示</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電日東條首相於二十八日在第八十一屆議會、發表施政演說、原辭如次、</p>
<p>方今帝國正以號爲世界强大之英美兩國爲手、而展開顚覆其制覇世界野心之偉大戰爭、俾使萬邦各得其所、兆民各安其生、此乃帝國健國以來之大理想、自不待言、蓋帝國三十年來之唯一目標、即在實現此偉大之理想、抑帝國自奉戴官戰大詔以後、即　一億總力努力於擊破英美亦即爲期實現此大理想以迅速安定卞東亞、建設根據道養之新秩序、故帝國之與具有同一目的之盟邦相互提携、以實現世界眞正和平者即爲　東亞戰爭之目的、此與小美犧牲他國爲自國繁榮而榨取其他民族相較、其本質實完全不同、今帝國於戰爭之第一年中、已堅確完成此戰爭目的之是礎、宜戰火詔一下、皇軍將兵即於聖威之下、迅速擊潰英美荷在東亞之兵力、進而攻略確保東亞之戰略要地、此種戰略上之優越地位、今後因陸海軍之緊密協力　開攻勢、及與此相呼應之戰力增强等而將益形擴充强化、茲試舉一例、說明此戰略上優越地泣　飛機之關係、即具有陸上根據地之飛機其威力極大、故當此陸上航空根據地發　非常威力之時皇軍因　戰之初即　得偉大戰果、而得配列適當之有力航空根據地、現且積極增强中、此等擁抱大東亞地域之多數航空根據地之日益增强、更可充分發揮其威力、現正佔領地域內之要地中、以此等航空根據地隨處着着　備有力之作戰據點、又於要衝地點配備兵力、乃於茲完成攻防全面之配備、帝國於　戰爭之第一年中、敢　已確立必勝基礎者、實在於此、</p>
<p>戰時資源無虞匱乏</p>
<p>當大東亞戰爭未爆發前、帝國石油橡皮等重要戰時資源殊感不足、敵人英美乃即侮我國爲貧乏之國、並乘機實　經濟絕交、以圖一舉使我國屈服、然在一年後之今日、世界最大寳庫之南洋各地、已悉爲吾人所確保、戰前英美所利用獨佔之重要資源今已歸入我人掌握、是故帝國已確保充分資源、而能進口任何大規模之戰爭、反之戰前自詡爲資源豐富之英美、今日在車要戰爭物資上已顯露一大缺陷、彼　曩昔求之於西南太平洋者爲橡皮·錫·金雞納霜等、其焦慮之色已難以掩飾、彼等所以甘冒戰峪上之不利而採取決戰者亦即在此、帝國今日除在戰略上佔有優越地位外、復在資源上佔得更有利之地位、吾人爲使此等資源充分發揮共力量、今後尙需史大之努力、自不待言、今日已有十億勤她之民衆、爲大東亞黎明而醒覺、致協力吾人、故對於此廣大資源之利用、深可樂觀、至英美此時賴其工業力量、銳意謀戰力之恢復與增進、並已採取反攻態勢、此固爲吾人所不可疏忽者、然亦爲吾人所當利用者、因之木年實可　爲吾人擴大過去一年餘听獲之偉大戰果、所確立必勝條件上決戰期之一年、</p>
<p>與各盟邦密切提攜</p>
<p>茲帝國與盟邦諸國之提携已益趨緊密互相呼應對英美採取攻勢、必使英美喪失作戰能力、放棄作戰意志、以謀從速完成戰爭目的、此際滿洲國國基更趨鞏固、與我國分擔北邊防務、並以大東亞建設之先驅、而謀　需產業之發展、以協力我國戰力之增强、而充分發揮大東亞後方之威力、換言之、滿洲國今日之發展與充實、卽足以表示大東亞全域明日之姿態、友邦中華民國在在主席領導之下、其國力亦日趨强化、本月九日中華民國國民政府對英美兩國宜戰、此對　滅英美之大東亞戰爭允有偉大貢獻、中華民國在在主席領導之下、一致團結、奮起作肚種決意、實深敬佩、常中華民國國民政府宣戰之際、帝國爲適應新事態、乃根據樹立中日友好關係之方針、對於交還在華專管租界、承認收回上海公共租界·厦門公共租界及北京使館區、撤廢治外法權、處理在華敵產等、立即採取必要之步驟、英美對帝國此種措置深感不安、乃於本月十一日發表毫無價値之宣言、與渝方的定交還有名無實之租界、不値一笑、以言泰國、在畢本首相之領導下、舉國一致遵守與我國所訂之攻守同盟、毅然而起從事擊减英美之協同作戰、克服一困難與障碍、爲完成建設大東亞共同目的而盡莫大之努力、茲已確實成爲帝國之同志國、至於歐洲方面、德義等盟邦各國與帝國之關係已更趨　固、正排除各種困難、到處充分發俾震驚世界之大戰力、擴充業已建立之確固不敗地位、故今後將更展開有利之攻勢、至北非方面之事態、僅爲戰爭過程中之一小波瀾、對於大勢毫無影響、且母寗謂此種新事態、乃為含有徹底痛　英美軍良機將至之意味、故德義兩國已準備乘此機會發揮其猛威、同時更與帝國協力作戰、發揮威力、使東西相應痛擊英美、因此吾人之戰友東西盟邦各國之親密關係、已與日俱增、爲爭取共同勝利、完成共同理想、本大公無私之精神、實行週密協力、反親英美當作戰之際、或爲自身之利害關係、或爲戰錢問題而屢發生爭執之醜態、僅此一事已足證明彼我正邪之分、最後勝利之誰屬、於此亦更爲明顯、余於此不禁思及盟邦各國活躍之經過及其前途、謹與諸君同對盟邦今日所獲之偉大成果、表示甚深敬賀之意、余更對盟邦各國予吾帝國之絕大協力表示謝意、並以至誠祝禱今後之繼續健鬥獲得成　、</p>
<p>南洋麵甸協力建設</p>
<p>現南洋各地在軍政之下、住民已久沐恩光、故均能衷心協力建設洵堪慶賀、抑帝國對於不瞭解吾人眞意者、　當徹底加以膺懲、然若一日歸入治下、則即待以親子之　、馬來、蘇門答臘·爪哇·婆羅洲西里伯等地在日軍指導之下、治安已完全恢復、住民亦安居樂業、度其罕有之幸福生活、而帝國亦克體原住民多年之期望、使各地成爲彼等安居之地、迄今已漸獲成果、至於緬甸方面、治安亦早經恢復、日爲呼應帝國不動之大方針、全緬　民已早在巴莫長官之領導下、得當即日軍之協力、積極建設緬人之一緬甸、以期　　於大東亞建設、其努力實深堪感銘、帝國於此至遲將於本年內承認現在之緬甸行政府、就其所轄之區域建設緬匍國、關於此事、余曩昔即一會在議會向內外闡明我國之眞一意、故緬人多年來期望之獨立、已可於茲實現、今能　議會聲明者、實寫我國之夙願、爲緬甸爲新大東亞、均深堪慶賀、余又曾於去年之本議塲中、對菲律賓民衆聲明、即若能瞭解帝國之　意、以建設大東亞共榮國一翼之資格共起協力、則帝國將欣然予彼等以獨立之榮譽、茲余此特再重申前言、蓋今日已見菲律賓在新指導者伐爾加斯長官領導之下、誠意協力</p>

<p>帝國、治安亦逐漸恢復、且已步上正軌、此實洵洵信賴者、余衷心深期菲律濱得能積極協力吾人、則菲律濱之獨立將儘速期其實現、刻緬句與菲律濱均已處於可以滿足希望之狀態中、至緬甸比憐之印度、則猶處於舌悶之中、吾人試將兩者相此、　有無限感慨、誠如余前在本議塲所言、印度在精神上已脫離英國而獨立、英國今尙不改其故態、竟將印度之指導者以及愛國志士等、悉行逮捕加以監禁、且一再蹂躪印度民衆、英美軍隊復以即度為根據地、攪亂新生緬甸之和平、以圖展伸其魔手、但今日皇軍巳對此等英美軍隊加以猛攻、且今日印度已早有一部份人士了解帝國眞意、與帝國協力從事戰爭、吾人對於為建設新生印度而在印度國內國外繼續奮鬥之印度指導者及其民衆、　深同　、並深望其偉業、能於不久之將來獲得成功、茲再一再聲言、即帝國對於印度之爭取獨立、決不惜予以全力之協力、今日中華民國國民旣已參加大東亞戰爭、其打倒英美之大義名分至為明顯、乃渝方猶甘為英美鷹大、自殘其同胞、續作無益智抗戰、實為中國民衆之敵、並為中華民國傳統之叛徒、帝國於此特再鄭重聲明、決斷然加以膺懲、至帝國對澳洲之態度與對渝者完全相同、蓋澳洲旣依賴英美執迷不悟、則帝國之加以痛擊、實非得已、</p>
<p>厲行國策爭取勝利</p>

<h3>大東亞各國一心一德　業已奠定必勝基礎　谷外相在議會闡明外交</h3>
<p>東京廿八日中央社電　日谷外相本日上年於議會席上發表外交演說如次、日本自與英美宣戰後、世界除若干中立國外、已成寫兩大對立之陣營、雙方各舉全力遂行戰爭、展開空前未有之世界大戰、國際情勢亦隨之而起劃時代之大變革、回顧過去一年間及目下之世界情勢、可知日本在東亞依然崛起、實予久受英美壓迫之東亞各民族、以共同奮起之良機、中滿泰等國即以物資及精神兩方面與日本協力、完成戰爭、同時南方各民族得日軍之助、亦均由英美之極桔中擭得解放、彼等已深悟英美兩國之榨取野心、並理解建設大東亞共榮國在歷史上之必然性、遂誓與日本協力、共同建設及防衛大東亞、至今已奠定必勝之基礎、</p>
<p>軸心國益團結　在歐洲方面、因日本對美開戰所獲之偉大戰果、益激發軸心國之士氣、而對建設歐洲新秩序之信心亦形彌堅、最近北非方面德義兩軍由埃及戰綫撤退後即以迅速果敢之對策將重點置於突尼西亞方面、將由該方面挫折英美軍之攻勢、英美方面圖離間軸心開係之謀、不但未奏效、反使德義兩國及歐洲軸心方面之關係益趨鞏固、因此最近敵方復唱第二戰綫論、又英美兩軍不法侵入西北非洲後、法國之情勢雖一時稍見混亂、幸德義兩國之理解及賴伐爾手掌不動之親德政策、故事態即歸平靜、該國與德義間之協力關係亦更趨緊密、目下德義及歐洲各國益認識共異之運命、與日本鞏固團結、向不屈不撓必勝不敗之態勢邁進、至於英美方面開戰以來、因日本屢戰屢勝、在物質與精神兩方面均予英美以重大打擊、其後即忙於樹立對策、恃美國豐富物力企圖在二三年後發動「總攻勢」、自稱目下以主力對付德國、並以物資援助蘇聯、對德作戰本身則圖培養戰力、然其間日軍擴大戰果、北自阿留申羣島南迄印度之廣大區域內、均在日軍制壓之下、英美兩國輿論對政府之誤算深表不滿、一致要求即時反攻、英美兩國政府因見事態嚴重、為挽回頹勢計、美國遂積極强化戰時體制、建設阿拉斯加公路、强化澳洲之防禦、更在渝方及印度方面設空軍根據地、圖對日反攻、復興英國在朗及伊拉克增强兵力、速接非洲及亞洲西南、圖阻止德義軍向該方面挺進、日本不僅注意世界情勢轉換、更如强與東亞各國之關係、同時增進與德義等國之提携、以期共同對英美作戰、並整備協力同向建設世界新只需邁進、</p>
<p>中日親善合作　中華民國已於本月九日對英美宣戰、闡明與日本協力建設大東亞新秩序之決意、同時發表關於協力完遂戰爭中日共同宣言、且關於交還俎界撤廢治外法權之中日協定、日政府亦當日發表聲明、蓋中日合作提携、本為自然之趨勢、而從前中日兩國所以不能合作、實因英美從中作祟、大東亞戰爭發生後、日本節節勝利、東亞之形勢亦隨之突變、即英美在東亞之據點悉被覆滅、使其永無盤據之地、目下中日兩國互相協力、正向完遂戰事之途邁進、蓋中華民國之獨立繁榮、與日本及全大東亞各國至繫榮福祉完全一致、故日本毅然放棄過去不平等之制度、與中國在大東亞本來面目上互相信賴互相提携、此誠為歷史上之天然性、實堪為大東亞大局而慶幸也、至於日滿關係、亦在秉一心一德、及不變之精神密切協力、英美方面近見日本交還租界並撤廢在華治外法權、即於本月十一日與渝方成立交還租界撒廢治外法權之協定、英美返還此種已喪失之權益、無非圖欺瞞世界而已、由此足見美英狡猾陰險之一斑、而渝方得此空頭支票、復喜形於色、竟忘却百年夙敵、此種情形實令人可笑也、</p>
<p>對泰越之關係　關於日泰兩國、除在軍事政治及經濟上緊密提携外、更締結文化協定、俾使兩國間作更進一步之協力、余深信本協定貢獻於復興大東亞之文化運動、及發展日泰關係者甚鉅、又日越間在軍事政治及經濟上素有緊密之關係、最近復成立金融上之協定、吾人深望越南富局熟察世界情勢、及日越問在大東亞之地位、積極與日本協力、</p>
<p>三國經濟協定　最近日德義三國各以全經濟力相互協力、遂行戰爭並實現世界新秩序起見、已於本月二十日締結日德義經濟協定、本協定即本三國條約之精神而具體實現於經濟方面者、故本協定實施後、不但三國之經濟協力更形圓滑、即貢獻於增强戰力者亦甚鉅、吾人對軸心國勝利之信心益形堅固、同時因本協定更能證明日本對建設大東亞共榮圈絕無排他或閉鎖之意向、大東亞及歐洲共榮圈之建設、絕非如英美式之空虛宣傳、而係實事求是者、</p>
<p>對蘇政策不變　至於日蘇關係、自昭和十六年（民過三十年）四月成立中立條約以來、日本素尊重該條約、對蘇之外交方針絕無變更、但日政府之根本方針、當以蘇聯方面亦遵守本中立條約為前提、此乃理所當然也、抑此次戰爭正如宣戰大詔所明示、日本乃為排除英美之非法壓迫、並為謀自存自衛、故不得不崛起奮戰、前此德義之毅然執戈而起者、亦因英美藉擁護世界和平為美名、以維持凡爾賽體制為壓迫德義所致、至日本之退出國際聯盟及德義之相繼退出者、亦不外為英美暴行而起、乃英美首腦企圖戰後和平、妄訂大西洋憲章、捏造是非濫施宣傳、凡此種種要皆脫胎於凡爾賽體制、謀以英美為本位、繼績其制霸世界之野心、英美苟能實現以上企圖則德義及新興各國均將失去其各得其所之良機、世界之永久和平亦必將無完成之望、</p>
<p>英美實為戎首　英美雖詭稱為自由而戰爭、然徵諸歷史、日德義三國豈有威脅英美自由及其生存之事實試觀彼等本國擁有廣大領土及豐富資源、自不難和平開發、詎知彼等不但早已排斥東洋移民、且進而渡太平洋、以旁若無人之勢侵入東亞、最近竟援助渝方以延長東亞戰禍、且猶顛倒事實欺瞞其國民、故此次戰爭之釀成、英美首腦者應負全責、彼等罪惡、神人共憤、苟如彼等主張處罰挑撥戰爭之責任、則首應受罰者即為彼等自身此固毋庸贅言、日本於一年以前已毅然躍起、所以如此者、端在排除英美利已的世界支配體制之壓迫、使抱正義者得正當之地位、俾根據道義以建設新秩序、其目的唯在求萬邦之各得其所、凡此既為世界所周知、故日本之戰爭目的大義炳然、正邪之分即在於此、最後勝利自必屬於光明正大、回顧吾建國二千六百餘年至日本、有從未戰敗至光輝歷史、此即為日本之戰爭乃均係破邪顯正之戰、此次大戰其規模至大戰鬥至烈、均為歷史所罕有、而其意義尤極為深遠、故益信戰時外交之要諦、惟在貫澈此作戰之意義、宣揚政戰一致、遂行對外施策以期毫無遺憾云、</p>
<h3>賀屋藏相演說　戰時財政</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日賀屋藏相本日在議會席上發表戰時財政演說、首就本年度歲出及歲入總預算、國內經濟金融等、加以詳細說明、繼就大東亞共榮圈之經濟金融述稱、大東亞共榮圈內之經濟金融、在中日滿三國互相協力之下、努力開發重要國防資源、以完成各項經濟建設、又日本與泰國越南間之物資交流亦益趨發展、此對增强戰力建設大東亞實有極大貢獻、誠不勝欣幸、日本並充分協力大東亞各國發展經濟、去年度對中滿兩國投資二十一萬萬圓、中日事變以來投資總額為七十二萬萬圓、又因鑒於通貨之健全發展、實為發展經濟之基礎、故曾對中泰等國供給安定金融之借款、中國參戰後、日本更謀加强兩國在經濟上之協力、處理敵產問題、亦為本此方針而特別實施者、關於南方各佔領地方面資源之開發及利用益見發展、此種物資貢獻於增强戰力者亦甚鉅、南方開發金庫之業務隨之日益擴充、各日商銀行亦向各地發展、日政府又為圓滑供給南方各佔領地開發經濟及支付軍費上所必要之資金起見、遂使南方開發金庫增加辦理發行紙幣之業務、因此日本與南方各佔領地在財政經濟上更具密切之關係矣、繼就共榮圈內經濟金融問題說明如次、（一）處理敵產問題、此次戰爭日軍在節節順利下、多數敵產皆歸日本所有、日政府乃設置特殊財產資金特別會計、將一切敵產作為特殊財產、歸入特別會計項內而加以運用、俾供增加生產及充作軍用、其對擴充戰力及增强戰時財政力上亦有極大貢獻、（二）計劃經營共榮圈內之交易問題、最近設置交易營團、俾對交易作有統制的經營、並設置調整滙兌交易特別會計、凡在物資交易上所生之損益、均作為國家之收支而屬於特別會計、綜合辦理收支、俾實現有計劃之交易、並進行共榮圈內之滙兌及物價政策、共榮圈內之決算制度、即以日本圓決算方式行之、凡中日滿泰早已採用此方式矣、此次與越南成立日越協定、對決算之方式均以圓為準、一變過去以英美貨幣為決算之方式矣、大東亞圈內玆已確立以日本為核心之金融圈、又日德義三國間最近已成立經濟協力之協定、三國復本此協定而締結有關三國間貿易技術及金融協力之條約、本協定正式成立後、三國間之友好關係更趨緊密、即在相互間物資之交流及金融上之關係、亦日趨圓滑、因此大東亞經濟圈及歐洲經濟圈之連繫亦更趨緊密、東西兩經濟圈之基礎遂吿奠定云、</p>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日賀屋藏相今日在衆院演說、對於日本國內及大東亞共榮圈全般之戰時財政金融等主要問題、闡述極為詳盡、賀屋　演說中所可注意者、首為增稅一項、氏稱、除對奢侈消費實行高率課稅外、並決定對於在決戰體制下不能節約之消費分別予以提高稅率、擴大課稅範圍或制定新稅、又關於本年度之金融經濟情形、賀屋氏說明謂、（一）去年下半年日本銀行券之增加、較諸從前增加率尤為减少、去年度之資金儲蓄總額計達二百十三億一千七百萬圓、（二）去年度國債之消化計發行額為三十三億圓、已消化百二十八億圓、消化率為百分之九十六·二、此為中日事變以來最佳之成績、據賀屋氏之演說、可知日戰時經濟狀况極為良好、（下略）</p>

<h3>論日德義經濟協定成立</h3>
<p>其一</p>
<p>日德義三國，為完成戰爭，并確立戰勝後之建設新秩序計劃起見，商妥締結經濟合作協定，已於二十日簽署成立。</p>
<p>三國間在文化，政治，軍事上保持密切聯繫之關係，尤以去年一月訂立軍事協定後，維繫更密。德義承認日本指導建設東亞新秩序之地位，并加尊重，伺時日本亦承認德義指導建設歐洲新秩序之地位，而加以尊重。根據此方針，互相協力，在昭和十五年九月之三國公約中闡述頗明，自無絲毫變更。然嗣後情勢急變，東西各國，形成軸心國與協約國二集團，酣戰方烈，世人咸表關心，日德義為確保戰勝起見，故締結此項新經濟協定。</p>
<p>三國間訂立軍事同盟，迄已一載，目下又有經濟協定之簽訂，前者為爭取勝利所必需，後者為經濟建設所不可或缺。在日本之宣戰詔書中，闡明以解除加諸日本之軍事，經濟壓迫，及確立東亞永久和平為目標。日當局亦曾反覆闡明；「作戰即建設」之主張。總之，自軍事而至經濟之發展，在在可見日德義三國為謀歌亞福祉之意旨。換言之，現代戰爭中之軍事，經濟，有一體不可分之關係。</p>
<p>新經濟協定中，決定部門頗為廣泛，有效期間與三國同盟之期限相同。實施該協定之詳細事項，尙在繼續協商之中。德國已投資一千萬馬克，設立東亞銀行，與日本提携，開始日圓與馬克之決算制度。吾人在世界戰局上，已奠定必勝不敗之擾勢，不特同心協力推進擊滅英美之戰爭，同時，在戰時戰後，挽救英美全權支配下之世界，以期實現以軸心為中心之新世界秩序，今次新經濟協定之最大目標，亦在於此。</p>
<p>關於日越間經濟合作問題，在維希協商之結果，新訂一日越決算協定，旨在補充前年五月締結之日越經濟協定，同年七月締結之共同防衛協定，及同年十二月之軍事協定。</p>
<p>簽字日期亦為一月二十日，非僅限於確立日越經濟關係，即大東亞各地與越南之貿易及決算，亦已確定一最善方針。根據三國同盟及今次三國經濟協定，德義均能尊重日本指導建設東亞新秩序之地位，同時法國政府亦能同樣繼德義而對日尊重。</p>
<p>今後三國合作愈密，各謀提高本國在世界之地位，歐亞兩方一致推進，指導東西兩端之建設新秩序。（任：譯自一月二十三日東京朝日新聞）</p>
<p>其二</p>
<p>關於日德，日意經濟協力的協定，本月二十日已在柏林及羅馬，由各該國代表，簽字蓋印，即日發生效力了。</p>
<p>這個協定成立後，由於日德意三國條約而確立之政治的連繫及經濟上的相互協力，為之擴大强化。由此當可舉大東亞及歐洲二大經濟圈的總力，打倒共同敵人英美，以確保最後勝利。同時，即在戰後，亦因二大經濟圈之永久的協力，得以建設大東亞及歐洲新秩序，以謀各該民族的共存共榮，而樹立廣泛的建設計劃之基礎；故其意義非常重大，實為對於軸心國的完成戰爭及戰後建設之劃期的協定。</p>
<p>英美以封鎖海上的手段，對付軸心國，使消耗戰時資材，俾向其屈服，此為其作戰的第一目標。然而軸心國的海空勢力，却把敵人的封鎖網隨處衝破。開戰以來，英美的船舶喪失，實己達二千萬噸之鉅，故敵人自身，反已沉淪於反封鎖的悲境中了。一方面德意則在歐洲，由於與友邦的經濟協力及確保廣大的佔領地域的開發，逐漸伸張其勢力，以期對於戰時陣勢的强化，可無遺憾；日本則佔領世界寶庫之南方各地，收無限的戰時資源於掌中，造成了堪耐任何長期　爭之自給自足的基礎。</p>
<p>前美國駐日大使格魯，曾警吿美國朝野，勿輕視日本的國力。彼指稱日本在中國事變四年間的戰力消耗，實是準備大東亞戰爭的積蓄者而非消耗。現在日本已握有南方的資源，將來實現開發運營時，必或為世界最大的資源國。因以强調持久戰的危險，慫憑美國當局對於戰爭方針作根木的修正，並促請民衆奮起。吾人敢謂日本早已成為世界無比的强國，更成為世界最大的資源國，固不待格魯的指稱了。現在日德意三國，舉此廣大的亞歐二大經濟圈，於資材，於技術，均可有無相通，樹立了一貫的戰時戰後之遠大計畫。我等軸心國的勝利，己屬必然，而此協定，實為對於歐亞新秩序建設前途，燃起一大光明之火把者，尤其可以慶幸。（丁：譯自一月廿二日東京讀賣報知）</p>

<h3>蘇軍續採攻勢　東線大戰南移　顯以爭奪羅斯托夫為目標　高加索德軍主力安然撤退</h3>
<p>柏林廿八日海通社電　東綫中路之戰爭、似已演成南路之大戰、蘇軍之攻勢現正自伏朗尼慈西北向南伸展中、兵力相當雄厚、其目的是否向頓河盆地及羅斯托夫推進、則尙未明顯、蘇軍擬切斷自庫彭區至羅斯托夫主要鐵路綫之企圖則仍未放棄、但蘇軍在上週內殊少進展、並未能達到其目的、德軍在頓河下游迤東及瑪尼契迤南之抵抗極爲有力、對於德軍在高加索之轉移新陣地頗多幫助、故德軍主力並未稍受損失、德軍在斯達林格勒之英勇抵抗、對此亦有重大關係、蓋德第六軍若不作英勇之抵抗、遏阻蘇軍自伏爾加灣向南之攻勢、則高加索方面德軍之撤退有被切斷之虞、今則此一危機已獲避免、</p>

<h3>保富法（八）</h3>
<p>— 聶雲臺</p>
<p>中國的聖哲，儒佛老的垂訓，都反覆可嚀說明此理。易經說：「天道虧盈而益謙，地道變盈而流謙，鬼神禍盈而福謙，人道惡盈而好謙。」尙書說：「滿招捐謙受益，時乃天道。」尙青又說：惟天，福善禍淫。」這個淫字不是單指性慾，是指一切事的放縱與過分，可以說就是驕滿。又再具體點說，就是驕奢淫逸貪很暴橫，（古文善用術語一淫字包含衆義。）這種種的惡行，自然會招致意料不到之橫禍。淫字的對面就是善，善字的意義甚廣泛，若要確切的說明，衆善都含謙德的意義，都以謙德爲基本，易經是說明天道的書，乾坤兩卦是總說天道的大旨。乾卦說：「能利天下而不言所利。」這就是謙　的意義。坤卦說：「坤雖有美含之，或從王事，不敢成也。」這三句的解說，是才華不露，功名不居，就是不務名不誇功，也是謙德的意義。金剛經說度盡衆生，自覺未度。又說布施濟衆，不覺有施。此是世界最高的道德，亦仞含謙德在內。再說孝弟忠信禮義廉恥八德，都是義務心重，權利心輕。義務心是自己覺得我對他還有義務當盡，這就是謙德。世間作惡的人，不過是　權心重，無義務心，常想在別人份上佔點便宜，缺少幫助他人之心。</p>
<p>古語說是重利輕義，正是謙德的反面。所以一切道德都在謙德的裏面，由謙發動，對父母兄弟就爲孝弟，對社會人羣就爲忠信禮義廉恥。凡人對於謙德善行，都恭敬歡喜，對於驕滿惡行，都怨怒隱恨，那麼天道降福降禍，說是天道，實是人情；說是天降，實山自作。上文已說天道就是人事的表現。尙書說：「天視自我民視，天聽自我民聽。」　嚴經說：「若令衆生生歡喜者，則令一切如來歡喜。」（如來的解釋爲第一義天，就是無上的天理。以心契合天理，名成正覺，又名成佛，又名如來。）所以我們爲善加福於人，我們自然還得其福，我爲惡加害於人，我們還自得其禍，從此可知我們對面的一切人，一切物，就是天。除此以外，更無別的天，亦無別的理。</p>
<p>那麽我們對他們做事說話，起念頭，表示臉色，都要格外小心注意。雖然他們或是愚笨，或是怯懦，或是老弱孤兒寡婦，無人幫助，我們若是欺凌了他，我們在不久的將來，我自己或我子孫也會同樣的愚懦孤寡被人欺凌。反過來說，若是我們對於這些無力量可憐的人，存慈愍心，設法幫助，後來我也會得別人的幫助，子孫永不致愚懦孤寡被人欺凌，這種天理循環的感報，有智慧眼光的人，自然能在社會上一家一家的人事上來觀察，更可以在歷史上一個一個的古代善惡的人的結果來證明，我現在要將每一種的事實，如作一事利益羣衆，或害及羣衆的報應，舉古人的一二例，作我們的勸勉和警戒，讓我在下文說明。（完）</p>

<h3>記和詩選</h3>
<p>— 君碩</p>
<p>王長春先生近編和詩選一集，都九百六十四首，均係友邦人士精心之作，爲王君旅日時隨見隨錄者。日昨趨訪於禮查飯店，承予延見，並指示一切，極爲感奮，從談詩道而涉及人生問題，頗多啟悟，爰錄其要點如次。</p>
<p>日本在弘文天皇時起，約距今一千二百七十年以前，當我國唐高宗咸亨三年之際，即注意中國詩之硏究，其間詩人輩出，佳作如林，弘文犬皇曾有供宴一詩云：「皇明光日月，帝德載天地，三才亞泰昌，萬國表臣義。」實爲和詩之濫觴。和詩宗我國陶淵明作風，頗多知行合一之理，對於文天祥之正氣歌，尤推祟備至，爲朝野所景仰者。</p>
<p>我國有若干詩集，早已散佚，在本國無從尋覓，而在日本圖書館內，却珍藏著足以稽考，日人之搜羅精密，重視學術之精神，實可欽佩。例如淸李調元編全五代詩九十卷，顧嗣立編元詩選一百十卷，康熙五十年勅編全金詩五十卷，又如康熙四十二年所編全唐詩計有四萬八千九百首，作者計二千二百人，均係皇皇巨著，但在國內，已難見到，不勝憾惜</p>
<p>和詩有獨特風格，古茂樸雅，不易多見。據吿該書選集之車要意義有二，一爲日人硏究中國詩，究較我國人爲困難，但不因困難而中止其硏究，反加倍努力去克服困難，是以能有高深的造詣，收穫豐富，實非悻致，世間事惟努力者庶有成就，足資吾人之楷模。其二，和詩宗陶潛，對於思想上之影響甚大，一切重知行合一，不惜個人犧牲，是日本人特有之人格，亦即所謂大和魂是也；如以大和魂譯成中國意義，即爲正氣二字，爲民族之至寳。是以大東亞戰爭爆發時，日人能以少制勝，以弱敵强，均爲此種精神之偉大作用，此種精神，決非一朝一夕之功，乃千百年來所培育者，借書籍流傳，活躍於字裏行間耳。</p>
<p>王君另選和詩百絕一册，亦多精湛之作，在日本出版者，其用　甚深，彌可欽佩。因提示各點，頗多珍貴與警惕之處，爰於歸來後追記之，容有錯誤之點，當由筆者負責，附此申明。</p>
<h3>徵文緣取第四名　我今年約計劃</h3>
<p>— 宋鵬程</p>
<p>歲月遞嬄，三十一年已與吾人吿辭，三十二年之執堂者已開始執行其職司。當茲新年的陽光普照大地，萬物欣欣向榮的時候，憶昔贍前，慨感無限，過去的韶光總算已經過去了，未來的征途尙待我去履上一個個深刻的脚印。站在新與舊的　界上，我必須先要通盤籌算一下今年進行約計劃，方不致使三百六十日又復虛度過去，在生命史上多添增一頁懺悔的回憶。</p>
<p>甲：關於本身所負職務上之計劃。</p>
<p>（一）計劃滬上各聾啞團體之統一</p>
<p>現居上海的聾啞同病共約有一千餘人，然聾啞團體竟多至十餘處，其中雖不乏眞正爲聾啞福利奮鬥者，然少數不肖份子利用本身的缺陷，及各界對聾啞者的同情心，僞組團體，冒名募捐以飽私囊，寡鮮廉恥，令人齒冷。我擬使其中眞正爲聾啞福利而工作的團體聯合起來，化小單位爲大單位，一方面向各界公吿眞相，一方面嚴重警吿不肖份子，庶使上海啞運能納入常軌。</p>
<p>（二）計劃滬上各聾啞學校之統一</p>
<p>現在設在上海一隅的聾啞學校共有七所（中華，上海，啞靑，光震，福啞，聖母院，中山，）在學之聾啞學童總共二百餘人，以二百餘人分配於七所學校中，平均每校不過三十人左右，並且聾啞敎育不同於普通救育，每一科目均須專家負擔，値茲吾國聾啞敎育尙未脫離萌芽時期，何來如許專門人才？縱使有如許專鬥人才可供各校應用，各校之經濟力亦有所未遝，因計劃使以上七校改組爲統一聾啞學校，庶使師資可集中，經費可寬裕，校舍可不再鴿籠式，此計劃自去年起迄今仍未實現，今年無論如何於可能範圍中必欲使其成功。</p>
<p>（三）計劃在外埠設立聾啞學校</p>
<p>爲謀聾啞敎育普及起見，於諸大城市中設立聾啞學校，藉使散佈於各地之莘莘殘廢聾啞幼童均有受敎育之機會，實爲當務之急，我於去年秋季會去嘉興設立中華聾啞協會附屬鴛湖聾啞學校一所，成績尙佳，倘今年聾啞協會方面經費有着，或私人經濟稍寬，則擬往蘇州或杭州籌辦聾啞學校。</p>
<p>（四）計劃恢復聾啞刋物。</p>
<p>在民國廿八年前上海中華聾啞協會總會智育組曾經出版有純聾啞性質之「闇譯」月刊一種，爲我國獨一無二之聾啞書報，惜於廿九年春季因經費人事上種種關係宣吿停刊，聾啞事業尙在發軔時期，亟須需要此種純聾啞性質之刊物作宣傳之用，使各界人士明瞭聾啞者並非完全朽木不可雕之材，而掃除輕視思想。並藉此刊物作各地聾啞者們情感的連繫。雖復刊上存留着若干困難，然我意不難設法解決也。</p>
<p>（乙）關於私人方面之計劃</p>
<p>我性慵倦，對私人生活向不嚴肅，致使健康方面大受損審，影響到精神萎靡，辦事欠持久力，此實非吾儕靑年應有之道，當茲新歲伊始，我決力求生活之正常，避免因事業，家庭，戀愛，各方面所引起的無謂煩惱，西諺「無健全之精神即無健全之事業，」充實精神是促使事業成功之最重要因素，深原油自我勉之。</p>
<p>造物賦予我以口耳的殘缺，不言不聞，在這遼闊的人間裏，我簡直渺小得毫無形影可言，然思物無窠材，竹片木屑皆有所用，日當此動　的偉大的時代裏，靑年人所負責任基重，吾力雖微，苟能堅守崗位，切切實實的幹下去，滙小流而成大川，對國家社會不無貢獻。</p>
<p>（按：宋鵬程君年二十二歲，上海聾啞學校畢業，現任中華聾啞協會智育組幹事等職。）</p>
<h3>讀「二十四孝圖」（二）</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>——給我的女兒</p>
<p>古代帝王或闊人都於人民有大功績，盤古開天地，女媧補天，伏羲畫八卦，興庖廚，神農敎稼穡，軒轅制衣裳文字，大禹治水。湯武搶奪人家的江山，似乎沒有什麼好處，却又做「弔民伐罪」也了不起。當中只有堯舜無話可說，於是堯是垂拱而治，有治績：舜是孝子，品行好。文王「三分天下有其二以服事殷」，本來可謂忠了，但忠却和他的少爺的「弔民伐罪」有點矛盾，必須再加點什麼美德，這就來了孝。開天地，補天，是完全的神話，存而不論，別的東西，大概也都是逐漸發明，讀過社會進化史之類的書的人，應該可以理解，說是帝王所發明，一面固然由於古人的愚昧，不知那些東西從何而來，强作解事的信口胡謅；一面也應該是一種大的欺騙；凡作帝王的人都於人民有大功績，人民就不應該反對他，後來的帝王，雖然自己似乎無功績，但他的祖先曾經有遇，也不能輕易反對。漢高祖時代的話比較難說了，人漸漸不容易受騙，著書立說的人也漸漸多，許多東西已經明發，新的東西又不是說要發明就可馬上辦到的，他老先生做了幾年皇帝，他的父親還要跪在門口接他，與孝之類似乎太不相干，於是來了新的欺騙：他是龍種，他的母親跟龍睡過的；並且他的鼻子大。人怎能叫自己的母親跟龍睡覺呢？就是能，應該睡覺的時候，自已還沒有生出來，也無法督促。至於鼻子呢，人是很少方法使他變得大些的，真像西哈諾不能把自己的鼻子變得小一樣。那么，皇帝就只好讓劉邦去做，我輩小鼻人種，趁早不要痴心妄想。孝也是一樣，你想做皇帝嗎？除非像舜和文王那樣講孝。沒有了父母的人首先沒有資格，有資格的，如果真的像他們都那樣盡孝，孝來孝去，就會壯志消磨盡淨，絲毫想做皇帝的野心都沒有了</p>

<p>然後是那個狂亂的愛德華在位的十年，正像一盞電燈，在牠燃盡的以前，格外光亮了一下。</p>

<p>一個四月的傍晚，風雨交加着解釋着味吉爾的作品的第四班，不很用心思，因爲在報紙ｈ　正有着刺激的消息：尤其年輕的格雷森（Grayson）一些也不留心，　是出神。一個安靜而神經質的孩子。</p>
<p>『格雷森，下了課—呃哼—等一下。』然後：—</p>
<p>『格雷森，我不要做得—呃哼—很嚴厲，因爲你在你的功課上—呃哼—還算好，可是今天—你似乎—呃哼—一些也不用心。有什麽有關係的事情麽？』</p>
<p>沒—沒有，先生。』</p>
<p>『好—呃哼—我們就不要再說到這個，不過—呃哼—下次我總希望好些。』</p>
<p>明天早上，全校都在喧傳着，格雷森的父親是搭乘「鐵達尼克」（Tltamic）號這條船的，到現在，對於他的運命，還沒有消息來。</p>
<p>格雷森的功課得到了請假；全天，全校的心思都集中在他的憂慮上。然後消息來了，他的父親恰好在那些得救者之中。吉普斯和這個孩子握手。『好，呃哼—我眞高興，格雷森。一個快樂的結局。你一定覺得人生到底還是可愛的吧。』</p>
<p>『是—是的：先生。』</p>
<p>一個安靜而神經質的孩子。這是大格雷森，不是小格雷森，吉普斯後來還要弔慰他。（二十四）社會服務</p>

<h3>The Best Way to Help Students—Promoting the Student Aid Movement</h3>
<p>The student aid movement is a type of movement that best suits our national conditions. Its most important significance lies in the fact that kind-hearted and capable people in society provide financial assistance to a large number of out-of-school young people, enabling them to pursue their studies and become useful talents to society. It uses the power of society to cultivate talents for society, and to reform and build a happy society.</p>
<p>China is a [blank] country. Therefore, although it was once the greatest ancient civilization in history and made great contributions to human culture, it inevitably feels behind in everything compared with the world's powers today. While there are many reasons for this, the most important is the low level of culture. The number of literate people among the 480 million people in the country is less than 20 percent. Just imagine, if more than 80 percent of a country's population is illiterate, then no matter how hard you try, it is impossible to demand the strength of the country. However, further ask why there are so many illiterate people in China? The main reason is that a large number of school-age children and young people are unable to attend school. The reason for this is, on the one hand, that China has been in turmoil for many years, the political situation is unstable, and military, political, and party expenses account for a very large part of the budget, and the government has no extra resources to support cultural and educational undertakings. Another aspect is that social organizations are unsound and have not made eliminating illiteracy and developing culture and education the most important and honorable social undertaking. Therefore, now we either don't talk about patriotism, or we don't seek social progress; otherwise, we should first use the power of both the government and society to devote ourselves to the work of eliminating illiteracy and cultivating talents throughout the country. The most important part of this work is that everyone contributes money and effort to give children, teenagers, and young people who cannot afford to go to school the opportunity to go to school and further their studies. We must understand that all good policies and all excellent systems in society rely on someone to implement and handle them. Therefore, eliminating illiteracy and cultivating talents is the most important, most fundamental, and most glorious task for all patriotic people in the country and society. This newspaper, therefore, does not consider its own abilities and occasionally guides the student aid movement for this reason.</p>
<p>The student aid movement is the most [blank] and most glorious undertaking in China. It is by no means something that can be completed with a single gesture or movement, nor can it be built by the efforts of a few individuals and groups. In our country's history, many great men who were enthusiastic about public welfare donated their property to help students, and the tradition has never been broken. How many great statesmen, scholars, and talents who have made contributions to the country and society have benefited from poor scholars? When drinking water, remember the source. There is no one who is not grateful to those who help students. Therefore, the imperial court had grand ceremonies of awarding [blank], and the people had the reputation of respecting virtue. It has been passed down through the generations as a virtue. However, in the past, helping students was an unorganized and unplanned individual action. It was sporadic and its contribution to the country and society was too small. Now, if we want to completely eliminate illiteracy and cultivate talents, we must rely on enthusiastic people from all walks of life in society to widely launch student aid competitions. Everyone should be honored to participate in the aid, regardless of the amount of aid, we always hope that everyone will fulfill their natural duty to society. In general, wealthy people should take the most aid and the most cultivated talents as their greatest glory. Everyone is unwilling to fall behind, and [blank] become a trend. Then, not only will the country and society benefit from it, but the participants themselves will also leave a lasting reputation for generations to come. It is indeed the greatest and most glorious legacy for their children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>Since this newspaper launched the student aid fund, it has received many enthusiastic people, either donating their salaries or selling their property. There is no distinction between men and women, old and young. That kind of enthusiastic emotion makes us feel grateful and tearful. Who says that the hearts of the Chinese people are dead! Who says that good things are difficult to do? The enthusiastic donations and student aid from all walks of life make us infinitely excited and optimistic about the future of our country and nation. We would like to extend our most sincere respect to the gentlemen who donated money to the country and society. We also hope that the vast majority of people in society who have assets and status will share this honor of the new era, and break the past record of donations. At the same time, we also sincerely hope that small donations, even one dime or one yuan, are the iron [blank] of the enthusiasm of people from all walks of life, and are the "settling [blank]" of the bright future of China. The more people who have this "settling money," the more talents will be cultivated.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, learning is the most [blank], and must become a trend of the times. From our experience in running student aid, such as the enthusiasm of donors and the enthusiasm of various schools and circles in helping us, it can be further proved that it is not impossible to create this trend of "helping students is the best." Recently, the enthusiasm for student aid in Shanghai has gradually increased. The rise of the anti-British and American Association's student aid movement is particularly worthy of praise. In this [blank] day of rain and snow, Mr. Zhang Yipeng, an old gentleman of high moral character, personally took charge of supervising the work despite the hardships. His enthusiasm for social and cultural undertakings is truly admirable. However, we can assert that in a large city like Shanghai, there must be many more people with the same enthusiastic spirit of doing good as Mr. Zhang. We sincerely hope that everyone will stand up, either by donating money to help students or by advocating and organizing. We also hope that the wealthy people in Shanghai will take advantage of this year-end season to set aside a certain percentage of their annual surplus, or save a portion from the year-end entertainment, participate in student aid in the glory of "helping students is the best," and work together to cultivate good children, forming a beautiful trend. In the future, the country and society will have a large number of talents, and the results will be truly immeasurable.</p>
<p>The student aid movement also needs the efforts and participation of the authorities of elementary, middle, and universities, and various specialized schools. They should set up more student aid scholarships in their own schools so that children from poor families who are out of school have one more opportunity to work hard and further their studies. Originally, running schools is different from any other undertaking. The reason why it is called a "sacred undertaking" is that it does not focus on the economic gains and losses of the school itself, but takes the overall plan of "educating people for a hundred years" for the country and society as the main goal. Especially in this difficult new era, the future of our country, nation, and society completely depends on our next generation, and we ourselves must have the spirit of self-sacrifice, and do our best to cultivate the talents of the next generation without fear of hardship and difficulty. On the one hand, starting from elementary school, we must work hard to eliminate illiteracy for the country and society. On the other hand, we must consider more for poor children in schools at all levels, and cultivate talents for the country and society. Especially in this era, the fees of general schools often make it impossible for families below the middle class to afford their children's education expenses. We can only hope that the bright school authorities will set up more student aid quotas, or implement student loan measures to assist the student aid movement in the society. This newspaper has received strong support from various schools in running the student aid movement. While grateful, we also hope that all schools in Shanghai will respond to the call, vying to be the first, and opening up the door to learning to jointly undertake the great plan of educating people.</p>
<p>The student aid movement is the best test of the hearts of the Chinese people today. We firmly believe that all parties will actively participate in the glory of "helping students is the best" and are unwilling to fall behind.</p>
<h3>Reopening of the Japanese Diet: Prime Minister Tojo's Speech Clarifies the Government's Policy: Strengthening Military Strength to Ensure Victory in the Future; Major Inspiration for the Independence of the Philippines and Burma</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) Japanese Prime Minister Tojo delivered a policy speech at the 81st Diet on the 28th. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>At present, the Empire is waging a great war against the powerful English and American countries, which are called the world's powers, to overthrow their ambition to dominate the world, so that all nations can get what they deserve and all people can live in peace. This is the great ideal of the Empire since its founding, and it goes without saying that it is the only goal of the Empire for the past 30 years, which is to realize this great ideal. After the Empire received the great imperial rescript to declare war, it used the total strength of 100 million people to strive to defeat the English and Americans, that is, to realize this great ideal, to quickly stabilize [blank] East Asia, and to build a new order based on morality. Therefore, the purpose of the East Asian War is to realize the true peace of the world by cooperating with the allied countries with the same goals as the Empire. Compared with the United States' sacrifice of other countries for its own prosperity and its exploitation of other nations, its essence is completely different. Now, in the first year of the war, the Empire has firmly completed the foundation of this war purpose. As soon as the war was declared, the officers and soldiers of the Imperial Army quickly defeated the British, American, and Dutch forces in East Asia under the divine power, and then captured and secured the strategic locations in East Asia. This strategic advantage will be further expanded and strengthened in the future due to the close cooperation between the army and navy [blank] offensive, and the corresponding increase in military strength. As an example, let me explain the relationship between this strategic superiority [blank] aircraft, that is, the power of aircraft with land bases is extremely great. Therefore, when this land air base exerts [blank] great power, the Imperial Army [blank] won great victories at the beginning of the war, and obtained properly arranged powerful air bases, and is now actively increasing them. The increasing enhancement of these numerous air bases embracing the Greater East Asia region can fully exert its power. In the key areas of the currently occupied areas, these air bases are used to [blank] equip powerful operational bases everywhere, and troops are deployed in key locations, so as to complete the comprehensive deployment of offense and defense. In the first year of the war, the Empire [blank] had already established the foundation for victory, which lies here.</p>
<p>Wartime Resources Not Worried About Shortages</p>
<p>Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Empire felt a lack of important wartime resources such as oil and rubber. The enemy, the British and Americans, insulted our country as a poor country, and took the opportunity to implement [blank] economic sanctions in an attempt to make our country surrender in one fell swoop. However, today, one year later, Nanyang, the world's largest treasure house, has been secured by us. The important resources that the British and Americans used to exploit and monopolize before the war are now in our hands. Therefore, the Empire has secured sufficient resources to import any large-scale war. On the contrary, the British and Americans, who boasted of being rich in resources before the war, have now revealed a major defect in essential war materials. They [blank] used to seek rubber, tin, and quinine from the Southwest Pacific, and their anxiety is difficult to conceal. The reason why they take the disadvantage of the battle and take a decisive battle is also here. Today, the Empire, in addition to occupying a superior position strategically, has also occupied a more advantageous position in terms of resources. In order to make these resources fully exert their power, we will need more historical efforts in the future, which goes without saying. Today, there are one billion diligent people who are awakened for the dawn of Greater East Asia and work together with us, so the utilization of these vast resources can be looked forward to with optimism. As for the British and Americans, they are relying on their industrial strength to vigorously seek the restoration and increase of their military strength, and have adopted an offensive posture. This is indeed something we cannot ignore, but also something we should take advantage of. Therefore, this year can indeed [blank] be regarded as a year of decisive battle on the basis of the great results gained in the past year and the establishment of the conditions for victory.</p>
<p>Close Cooperation with Allied Countries</p>
<p>Now, the Empire's cooperation with the allied countries has become increasingly close and responsive. Taking an offensive against Britain and the United States will cause Britain and the United States to lose their ability to fight and abandon their will to fight in order to complete the purpose of the war as soon as possible. At this time, the foundation of Manchuria is becoming more and more consolidated, sharing the northern defense with our country, and developing the industry in need as a pioneer of Greater East Asia construction to cooperate with our country's strengthening of military strength and fully exert the power of the rear of Greater East Asia. In other words, the development and enrichment of Manchuria today is enough to show the attitude of the entire Greater East Asia tomorrow. Under the leadership of Chairman [blank], the national strength of the friendly Republic of China is also increasing day by day. On the 9th of this month, the National Government of the Republic of China declared war on Britain and the United States, which has made a great contribution to the Greater East Asia War to [blank] destroy Britain and the United States. Under the leadership of Chairman [blank], the Republic of China is united and determined to rise up, which is deeply admired. When the National Government of the Republic of China declared war, the Empire, in order to adapt to the new situation, took the necessary steps in accordance with the policy of establishing friendly relations between China and Japan, regarding the return of special concession areas in China, the recognition of the recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession, the Xiamen Public Concession, and the Beijing Legation District, the abolition of extraterritoriality, and the disposal of enemy property in China. Britain and the United States were deeply disturbed by this measure of the Empire, and on the 11th of this month, they issued a worthless declaration, and the still nominally existing concessions of the Chongqing side were not worth laughing at. As for Thailand, under the leadership of Prime Minister Pibul, the whole country unanimously abided by the alliance of offense and defense concluded with our country, resolutely rose up to engage in the joint operation of destroying Britain and the United States, overcame all difficulties and obstacles, and made great efforts to complete the common purpose of building Greater East Asia, and has indeed become a comrade country of the Empire. As for Europe, the relations between the allied countries such as Germany and Italy and the Empire have become more [blank] solid. They are overcoming various difficulties and fully exerting their great military strength that shocks the world everywhere, expanding the solid and invincible position that has been established. Therefore, they will launch a more favorable offensive in the future. The situation in North Africa is only a small wave in the course of the war, and has no impact on the overall situation. Moreover, it cannot be said that this new situation is meant to contain the opportunity for the thorough pain [blank] of the British and American troops. Therefore, Germany and Italy are prepared to take this opportunity to exert their fierce power, and at the same time cooperate with the Empire in combat, exerting their power, so that the East and the West will correspond to painfully strike Britain and the United States. Therefore, the close relationship between our comrades and allied countries in the East and West has been increasing day by day. In order to win a common victory and complete common ideals, we implement close cooperation in the spirit of impartiality. When the pro-British and American countries were fighting, they often had disputes due to their own interests or financial problems. This alone is enough to prove the difference between us and the enemy, and who the final victory belongs to is even more obvious here. I cannot help but think about the active progress of the allied countries and their future. I would like to join you in expressing my deepest congratulations to the great achievements made by the allied countries today. I would also like to express my gratitude to the allied countries for their great cooperation with our Empire, and sincerely pray for their continued success in their future battles.</p>
<p>Cooperative Construction in Nanyang and Burma</p>
<p>Now, in various places in Nanyang, under the military administration, the residents have been bathed in grace for a long time, so they can wholeheartedly cooperate in the construction, which is worthy of celebration. The Empire should thoroughly punish those who do not understand our true intentions, but if they return to our rule one day, they will be treated like our own children. Under the guidance of the Japanese army, security has been completely restored in Malaya, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Celebes, and the residents live and work in peace and enjoy their rare happy lives, and the Empire has also fulfilled the expectations of the indigenous people for many years, making the localities a place where they can live in peace. So far, it has gradually achieved results. As for Burma, security has also been restored long ago. In order to respond to the Empire's unshakable policy, all the people of Burma [blank] have already, under the leadership of Governor Ba Maw, cooperated with the Japanese army to actively build a Burma for the Burmese people in order to [blank] contribute to the construction of Greater East Asia, and their efforts are truly commendable. The Empire will at the latest recognize the current Burmese government this year, and build a Burmese country in its jurisdiction. Regarding this matter, I have already explained the true intentions of our country to the inside and outside in the Diet. Therefore, the independence that the Burmese have been looking forward to for many years can be realized here. Today, I can [blank] declare it to the Diet, which is truly a long-cherished wish of our country, and it is worthy of celebration for Burma and for the new Greater East Asia. I also stated in the Diet last year that if the people of the Philippines can understand the [blank] intentions of the Empire and cooperate together with the qualifications of building a wing of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Empire will be happy to grant them the honor of independence. Here, I would like to reiterate my previous remarks, because today it has been seen that the Philippines, under the leadership of the new leader Governor Vargas, is sincerely cooperating</p>
<p>Continued on the third page</p>

<p>Continued from the second page</p>
<p>the Empire, and security has gradually been restored, and it has embarked on the right track, which is truly trustworthy. I sincerely hope that the Philippines will be able to actively cooperate with us, and then the independence of the Philippines will be realized as soon as possible. At this moment, Burma and the Philippines are both in a state where their hopes can be satisfied, while India, which is pitiful compared to Burma, is still in a state of mental distress. When we compare the two, we have infinite emotion. As I said before in the Diet, India has spiritually broken away from Britain and become independent. Britain is still not changing its old ways, and has arrested and imprisoned the leaders of India and patriotic people, and has repeatedly trampled on the Indian people. The British and American troops have also used the intensity as a base to disrupt the peace of the newborn Burma, in an attempt to extend their evil hands. But today, the Imperial Army has launched a fierce attack on these British and American troops, and today a part of the Indian people have understood the true intentions of the Empire and are cooperating with the Empire in the war. We have deep sympathy for the Indian leaders and their people who continue to struggle at home and abroad to build a new India [blank], and deeply hope that their great cause can be successful in the near future. Here, I would like to reiterate that the Empire will not hesitate to give its full cooperation to India's struggle for independence. Now that the people of the Republic of China have participated in the Greater East Asia War, the great righteousness of defeating Britain and the United States is very obvious. However, the Chongqing side is still willing to be an eagle and a dog for Britain and the United States, harming its own compatriots, and continuing to carry out a useless and unwise war of resistance, which is an enemy of the Chinese people and a traitor to the tradition of the Republic of China. The Empire would like to solemnly declare here that it will resolutely punish it. The Empire's attitude towards Australia is completely the same as that towards Chongqing. Since Australia relies on Britain and the United States and is obsessed, the Empire's painful blow is really unavoidable.</p>
<p>Vigorously Implement National Policies to Win Victory</p>
<p>Today, the Empire is engaged in a great war to determine the fate of the world under the ideal of a heroic army. The policy for the future is to concentrate all its strength on winning this great war. In order to win victory, on the one hand, the front line will more and more powerfully unfold the courageous military battle to make the enemy lose its combat power, and at the same time, in the rear, in order to adapt to the war, it is necessary to further enhance the combat power. Therefore, the domestic policy is only to concentrate on enhancing the combat power to win the victory. The guiding spirit of the government regarding the enhancement of combat power lies in making the 100 million compatriots fully exert their total strength. We Japanese people, with the Imperial Family as the center, have the spirit of national unity and are willing to selflessly devote ourselves to the Emperor's descent and sacrifice ourselves. Moreover, in this great war that determines the rise and fall of the imperial country, no matter the front or the rear, the enthusiasm to be loyal to the country and repay the Holy Grace in one ten thousandth has been ignited. I deeply trust this kind of national power, so I am confident that the overall utilization of this power to enhance combat power is the important task of the government. I stated in the Diet before that I would make the affairs of various administrative agencies as simple and powerful as possible within the possible scope, so that the remaining personnel could be active in various aspects of Greater East Asia. Therefore, after the government implemented this measure, it has reduced a considerable number of official quotas, and has also studied and improved the methods of promoting the affairs of various agencies in order to adapt to the needs of the wartime. All of these have achieved practical results, and many people have gone to various parts of Greater East Asia to engage in management and construction. The government deeply hopes that in the future, this policy can have practical results. Also, in order to adapt to the progress of the times, the government is implementing the unification of internal and external administration, and has set up the Greater East Asia Ministry to uniformly handle the affairs of the Empire in the Greater East Asia region. In order to adjust the domestic system during the war, the government intends to reform and strengthen public organizations and various departments such as agriculture, commerce, etc. Regarding the expansion of material combat power, the past emphasis on the one-point doctrine has been further thoroughly implemented. In order to directly enhance combat power, we should devote all our efforts to the rapid increase in the production of important military supplies such as steel, coal, light metals, ships, and aircraft. Regarding shipbuilding, the government has also made its greatest efforts, and now it is harvesting the results. There is no need to worry about the future. Regarding steel production, etc., we are now adapting to various needs under new ideals in the entire city of East Asia, regardless of past methods. This time, in order to increase the production of important military supplies, the government eliminated laws and regulations that hindered production, and at the same time strengthened the authority of the Prime Minister of the Cabinet, so as to adapt to the situation and implement appropriate and flexible guidance, and to unify the guidance and supervision of the government offices, so that producers have something to rely on. In order to enhance combat power, the government believes that recruiting knowledgeable people from the private sector and gathering public wisdom is the most important thing. Therefore, the Greater East Asia Construction Review Council has been set up, which has obtained many valuable opinions. Now, we should continue to work hard to gather useful opinions from the private sector as much as possible within the possible scope.</p>
<p>Endure Hardship and Exert Strength</p>
<p>As mentioned above, there is no need to worry about the future of the war today, but it is natural to have all kinds of inconveniences and shortcomings in order to win victory. Therefore, in the process of [blank] achieving final victory, the people should endure all hardships, and the accumulation of the labor of 100 million people can produce the strength to win victory. Regarding ensuring the lives of the people, the government has taken all possible measures. We, the 100 million people, should also thoroughly implement the renewal of life, conserve consumption, increase savings, and establish a firm, unwavering, solid, vigorous, pure, simple, and wartime life. Today, the Empire needs more and more people to become the core of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, the government is implementing reforms to the school system, shortening the academic year, and expanding and strengthening various necessary subjects to quickly and directly enhance combat power in order to meet the needs of the times. The government believes that improving the health of the people during wartime is an urgent task at present. Therefore, the government intends to make all possible efforts on various health-promoting countermeasures, especially tuberculosis countermeasures. Taking this opportunity again, I would like to report to you that the population dynamics of our country, even under this unprecedented great war, have been very good for many years. The birth rate has reached an unprecedented level, while the death rate has decreased instead. All of these are very gratifying and can add infinite excitement.</p>
<h3>The Nations of Greater East Asia Are of One Mind and One Virtue, Having Already Established a Foundation for Certain Victory. Foreign Minister Tani Clarifies Diplomacy in the Diet.</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch): Foreign Minister Tani delivered a foreign policy speech at the Diet today, stating that since Japan declared war on Britain and the United States, the world, except for a few neutral countries, has become two opposing camps, each using all its strength to wage war, unfolding an unprecedented world war. The international situation is also undergoing epoch-making changes. Looking back at the world situation over the past year and at the present, we can see that Japan has risen again in East Asia, giving the nations of East Asia, which have long been oppressed by Britain and the United States, a good opportunity to rise up together. The countries of Manchukuo, Mengjiang, and Thailand are cooperating with Japan in both material and spiritual aspects to complete the war. At the same time, the various southern nations have been liberated from the extreme pressures of Britain and the United States with the help of the Japanese army. They have deeply understood the exploitative ambitions of Britain and the United States, and understood the inevitability of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in history. They have vowed to cooperate with Japan to jointly build and defend Greater East Asia, and have now laid the foundation for certain victory.</p>
<p>The Axis Powers Become More United: In Europe, the great achievements of Japan's war against the United States have further inspired the morale of the Axis powers, and their confidence in building a new European order has become even stronger. Recently, after the German and Italian forces retreated from the Egyptian front in North Africa, they quickly and decisively shifted their focus to Tunisia, where they will thwart the offensive of the British and American forces. The attempts by the British and American sides to alienate the Axis powers have not only failed, but have further strengthened the relationship between Germany and Italy and the European Axis powers. Therefore, the enemy has recently revived talk of a second front. Also, after the illegal invasion of Northwest Africa by the British and American forces, the situation in France was temporarily somewhat chaotic, but thanks to the understanding of Germany and Italy and Laval's unwavering pro-German policy, the situation quickly returned to calm. The cooperative relationship between that country and Germany and Italy has become even closer. Currently, Germany, Italy, and other European countries increasingly recognize their shared destiny, consolidate their unity with Japan, and move towards an indomitable and invincible stance. As for the British and American sides, since the start of the war, Japan's repeated victories have inflicted heavy blows on Britain and the United States in both material and spiritual terms. They have since been busy establishing countermeasures, relying on America's abundant material resources to attempt to launch a "general offensive" in two or three years, claiming that they are currently focusing on dealing with Germany and providing material assistance to the Soviet Union, while cultivating combat power in the war against Germany itself. However, in the meantime, the Japanese army has expanded its victories, and vast areas from the Aleutian Islands in the north to India in the south are under the control of the Japanese army. British and American public opinion has expressed strong dissatisfaction with the government's miscalculations, unanimously demanding an immediate counter-offensive. Seeing the seriousness of the situation, the British and American governments, in order to reverse the decline, the United States actively strengthened the wartime system, built the Alaska Highway, strengthened the defense of Australia, and established air bases in Chongqing and India, attempting a counter-offensive against Japan. Britain restored and increased its troops in Iran and Iraq, quickly connecting Africa and southwest Asia, attempting to prevent German and Italian forces from advancing in that direction. Japan is not only paying attention to the transformation of the world situation, but is also strengthening relations with various East Asian countries, while increasing cooperation with Germany, Italy, and other countries, in order to jointly fight against Britain and the United States, and to prepare for cooperation in building a new world order.</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese Friendship and Cooperation: The Republic of China declared war on Britain and the United States on the 9th of this month, clarifying its determination to cooperate with Japan in building a new order in Greater East Asia. At the same time, it issued a joint Sino-Japanese declaration on cooperating to complete the war, and a Sino-Japanese agreement on the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. The Japanese government also issued a statement on the same day. The cooperation and collaboration between China and Japan is a natural trend, and the reason why the two countries could not cooperate in the past was due to the sabotage of Britain and the United States. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan won victory after victory, and the situation in East Asia also changed suddenly, that is, the strongholds of Britain and the United States in East Asia were all destroyed, leaving them with no place to stay. At present, China and Japan are cooperating with each other and are moving towards the path of completing the war. The independence and prosperity of the Republic of China is entirely consistent with the well-being of Japan and all countries in Greater East Asia. Therefore, Japan resolutely abandons the past unequal system and trusts and cooperates with China in its original form in Greater East Asia. This is truly a natural historical development and is worthy of celebration for the overall situation in Greater East Asia. As for the relationship between Japan and Manchukuo, they are also cooperating closely with one mind and one virtue and an unchanging spirit. Recently, seeing that Japan had returned the concessions and abolished extraterritorial rights in China, the British and American sides concluded an agreement with Chongqing on the 11th of this month to return the concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights. Britain and the United States are returning these lost rights and interests in order to deceive the world. This shows the cunning and insidious nature of the United States and Britain. Chongqing is delighted with this empty promise, forgetting its century-old enemy, which is truly laughable.</p>
<p>Relations with Thailand and Vietnam: Regarding the relationship between Japan and Thailand, in addition to close cooperation in military, political, and economic affairs, a cultural agreement has also been concluded to enable further cooperation between the two countries. I am convinced that this agreement will make a great contribution to the cultural movement to revitalize Greater East Asia and to the development of Japan-Thailand relations. Furthermore, Japan and Vietnam have always had close relations in military, political, and economic affairs, and recently a financial agreement has been concluded. We sincerely hope that Vietnam will fully understand the world situation and the position of Japan and Vietnam in Greater East Asia, and actively cooperate with Japan.</p>
<p>Three-Nation Economic Agreement: Recently, Japan, Germany, and Italy, in order to cooperate with each other with their full economic strength to carry out the war and realize the new world order, concluded a Japan-Germany-Italy economic agreement on the 20th of this month. This agreement is based on the spirit of the Tripartite Pact and is concretely realized in the economic aspect. Therefore, after the implementation of this agreement, not only will the economic cooperation of the three countries become smoother, but it will also greatly contribute to enhancing combat power. Our confidence in the victory of the Axis powers is becoming increasingly firm. At the same time, this agreement further proves that Japan has absolutely no intention of being exclusive or closed in the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The construction of the Greater East Asia and European Co-Prosperity Spheres is by no means an empty propaganda like that of Britain and the United States, but is based on seeking truth from facts.</p>
<p>Unchanged Policy Towards the Soviet Union: As for Japan-Soviet relations, since the conclusion of the Neutrality Treaty in April of Showa 16 (1941), Japan has always respected the treaty, and there has been no change in Japan's diplomatic policy towards the Soviet Union. However, the fundamental policy of the Japanese government is premised on the Soviet Union also abiding by this Neutrality Treaty, which is only natural. Moreover, this war, as clearly stated in the declaration of war, is because Japan had no choice but to rise up and fight for self-preservation and self-defense in order to eliminate the illegal oppression of Britain and the United States. The reason why Germany and Italy resolutely took up arms earlier was also because Britain and the United States maintained the Versailles system under the guise of upholding world peace, thereby oppressing Germany and Italy. As for Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the successive withdrawals of Germany and Italy, it was also due to the atrocities of Britain and the United States. The British and American leaders attempted post-war peace, rashly established the Atlantic Charter, fabricated right and wrong, and abused propaganda. All of these originated from the Versailles system, seeking to take Britain and the United States as the basis to continue their ambition to dominate the world. If Britain and the United States could realize the above ambitions, Germany, Italy, and other emerging countries would lose the good opportunity to obtain what they deserve, and the permanent peace of the world would have no hope of completion.</p>
<p>Britain and the United States Are Truly the Head of the Bandits: Although Britain and the United States falsely claim to be fighting for freedom, based on history, have Japan, Germany, and Italy ever threatened the freedom and survival of Britain and the United States? Observing that they possess vast territories and abundant resources in their own countries, it would not be difficult for them to develop peacefully. However, they not only already rejected East Asian immigrants, but also crossed the Pacific Ocean and invaded East Asia with an arrogance as if no one else existed. Recently, they even aided Chongqing to prolong the war in East Asia, and still reversed the facts to deceive their citizens. Therefore, the leaders of Britain and the United States should bear full responsibility for the brewing of this war. Their sins are resented by both gods and men. If, as they advocate, the responsibility for instigating the war should be punished, then the first to be punished should be themselves, which goes without saying. Japan resolutely rose up a year ago precisely to eliminate the oppression of the self-serving world domination system of Britain and the United States, so that those who uphold justice can obtain a just position, and so that a new order can be built based on morality. Its purpose is only to seek the proper place for all nations. All of this is known to the world, so Japan's war aim is clearly righteous, and the distinction between right and wrong lies in this. In the end, victory will surely belong to the bright and upright. Looking back on Japan's glorious history of never being defeated in over 2,600 years since its founding, this is because Japan's wars have all been battles to defeat evil and manifest righteousness. This great war, in its scale and the intensity of the fighting, is rare in history, and its significance is extremely profound. Therefore, I have even more faith that the essence of wartime diplomacy lies in thoroughly implementing the significance of this operation, publicizing the unity of politics and war, and implementing external policies without any regrets.</p>
<h3>Minister of Finance Kaya's Speech: Wartime Finance</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch): Minister of Finance Kaya delivered a speech on wartime finance at the Diet today, first providing a detailed explanation of the general budget for revenues and expenditures for the current fiscal year, and the domestic economy and finance. Then, regarding the economy and finance of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, he stated that under the mutual cooperation of China, Japan, and Manchukuo, efforts are being made to develop important national defense resources in order to complete various economic constructions. Furthermore, the exchange of goods between Japan, Thailand, and Vietnam is also increasingly developing, which is of great contribution to enhancing combat power and building Greater East Asia. I am truly delighted. Japan is also fully cooperating with various countries in Greater East Asia to develop their economies. Last year, investments in China and Manchukuo amounted to 2.1 billion yen, and the total amount of investment since the Sino-Japanese Incident is 7.2 billion yen. Furthermore, in view of the fact that the sound development of currency is the foundation for economic development, stable financial loans have been provided to China, Thailand, and other countries. After China's entry into the war, Japan has been seeking to strengthen economic cooperation between the two countries, and the handling of enemy property issues has been specially implemented according to this policy. The development and utilization of resources in the various occupied territories in the south is becoming increasingly developed, and these materials are also making a great contribution to enhancing combat power. The business of the Southern Development Bank is expanding accordingly, and Japanese commercial banks are also developing in various regions. In order to facilitate the smooth supply of funds necessary for the development of the economy and the payment of military expenses in the various occupied territories in the south, the Japanese government has increased the business of issuing banknotes by the Southern Development Bank. Therefore, Japan and the various occupied territories in the south have an even closer relationship in terms of finance and economy. He then explained the economic and financial problems within the Co-Prosperity Sphere as follows: (1) Handling enemy property issues. In the current war, with the Japanese army achieving successive victories, most of the enemy property belongs to Japan. The Japanese government has established a special account for special property funds, using all enemy property as special property, incorporating it into the special account and utilizing it for increasing production and for military use. It also makes a great contribution to expanding combat power and enhancing wartime financial power. (2) Planning and managing the trade within the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Recently, a trade group has been established to conduct controlled management of trade, and a special account has been established to adjust exchange transactions. All profits and losses arising from the exchange of goods are treated as national revenue and expenditure and belong to the special account. Comprehensive management of revenue and expenditure is carried out to realize planned transactions and to carry out exchange rate and price policies within the Co-Prosperity Sphere. The settlement system within the Co-Prosperity Sphere is carried out using the Japanese yen settlement method. China, Japan, Manchukuo, and Thailand have already adopted this method. This time, with the establishment of the Japan-Vietnam agreement, the settlement method is based on the yen, changing the past method of using British and American currencies for settlement. A financial zone with Japan as its core has now been established within the Greater East Asia sphere. Furthermore, Japan, Germany, and Italy have recently established an economic cooperation agreement, and the three countries have concluded a treaty on trade, technology, and financial cooperation among the three countries based on this agreement. After the formal establishment of this agreement, the friendly relations among the three countries will become even closer, and the exchange of goods and financial relations among them will also become smoother. Therefore, the connection between the Greater East Asia Economic Sphere and the European Economic Sphere will also become closer, and the foundation for the two economic spheres will be laid.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency Dispatch): Minister of Finance Kaya gave a detailed explanation of the main problems of wartime finance and the economy in Japan and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere as a whole in a speech in the House of Representatives today. What is noteworthy in Kaya's speech is the item of increasing taxes. He stated that, in addition to implementing high tax rates on luxury consumption, it has been decided to increase tax rates, expand the scope of taxation, or formulate new taxes for consumption that cannot be saved under the decisive battle system. Regarding the financial and economic situation for the current fiscal year, Kaya explained that: (1) The increase in Japanese banknotes in the second half of last year was even smaller than the previous rate of increase. The total amount of savings last year amounted to 21.317 billion yen. (2) The amount of national bonds issued last year was 3.3 billion yen, and 12.8 billion yen has been digested, with a digestion rate of 96.2%. This is the best result since the Sino-Japanese Incident. According to Kaya's speech, it can be seen that Japan's wartime economic situation is very good. (The following omitted)</p>

<h3>Casablanca Conference Concludes; Roosevelt and Churchill Send Joint Telegram to Stalin; Agreement Concluded Between Giraud and de Gaulle</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Haitong Agency Dispatch): According to an official Moscow statement this afternoon, the British and American ambassadors to the Soviet Union presented Stalin with a joint letter from Roosevelt and Churchill.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 26th (Havas Agency Dispatch): Regarding the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting in Casablanca, news from London continues to report that General Alexander, Commander-in-Chief of the British Middle East Forces, and General Eisenhower, Commander-in-Chief of the American Forces in North Africa, both participated in the meeting. The Chairman of the Supreme Defense Committee of the Soviet Union was also invited to participate, but was unable to attend due to "personally commanding the Red Army offensive." However, he was constantly informed of the proposals of a military nature discussed at the meeting. Churchill declared after returning to London that the Casablanca Conference was the most important international conference he had ever attended. According to news from Moscow, Stalin received British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Kerr and American Ambassador to the Soviet Union Steinhardt, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov was also present. What was discussed at the meeting was not disclosed.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 27th (Havas Agency Dispatch): London reports that Generals de Gaulle and Giraud met in Casablanca in an attempt to eliminate differences between the leaders of the French factions, and afterwards issued a joint communique stating that an agreement has been reached on the ultimate goals they both hold. Both leaders feel the desire for the liberation of France. Giraud has appointed one committee member as a representative stationed at de Gaulle's headquarters, and de Gaulle has also sent a delegation stationed in Algiers to discuss military and economic issues, but only as a means of transmitting political suggestions. In addition, a spokesperson for de Gaulle's faction in London also stated that the meeting between Giraud and de Gaulle was very positive. "Under the current circumstances, it cannot be hoped that all outstanding issues will be resolved at once, but the first step has been completed, and we should congratulate each other."</p>
<h3>Litvinov's Diplomatic Activities</h3>

It is said that a French conscription law will be promulgated in Beirut next week. People in Ankara are very interested in the Casablanca Conference. An American journalist believes that the conference, in addition to discussing the Mediterranean strategy, also involved the issue of Turkey. The United States has requested that the issue of Turkey be discussed after the North African problem is resolved. However, Turkish authorities have recently stated that Turkey will maintain its neutrality in order to prevent the Allies from expanding the war to the Near East.</p>
<h3>On the Establishment of the Japan-Germany-Italy Economic Agreement</h3>
<p>Part 1</p>
<p>Japan, Germany, and Italy, in order to complete the war and establish a plan for building a new order after the victory, have agreed to conclude an economic cooperation agreement, which was signed and established on the 20th.</p>
<p>The three countries maintain close ties in culture, politics, and military affairs, and the relationship has become even closer since the military agreement was signed in January of last year. Germany and Italy recognize and respect Japan's position in guiding the construction of the new order in East Asia, and Japan also recognizes and respects Germany and Italy's position in guiding the construction of the new order in Europe. This policy of mutual cooperation was clearly explained in the Tripartite Pact of September 1940, without any changes. However, the situation has changed rapidly since then, and the countries in the East and West have formed two groups, the Axis powers and the Allied powers, engaged in fierce battles, which the world is concerned about. Japan, Germany, and Italy have concluded this new economic agreement in order to ensure victory.</p>
<p>It has been a year since the military alliance between the three countries was established, and now the economic agreement has been signed. The former is necessary for winning the war, and the latter is indispensable for economic construction. In Japan's declaration of war, it was clarified that the goal is to eliminate the military and economic oppression imposed on Japan and to establish lasting peace in East Asia. The Japanese authorities have also repeatedly clarified the claim that "fighting is construction." In short, from military to economic development, it can be seen everywhere that Japan, Germany, and Italy intend to seek the well-being of Greater Asia. In other words, the military and economic aspects of modern warfare are inseparable.</p>
<p>The new economic agreement covers a wide range of areas, and the period of validity is the same as the term of the Tripartite Pact. Detailed matters for the implementation of the agreement are still under negotiation. Germany has invested 10 million marks to establish the East Asia Bank, cooperating with Japan to start a settlement system in yen and marks. We have laid the foundation for certain victory in the world war situation, and not only are we cooperating to promote the war to destroy Britain and the United States, but also, in wartime and after the war, we will save the world from the total domination of Britain and the United States, in order to realize a new world order centered on the Axis powers. The biggest goal of this new economic agreement is also this.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of economic cooperation between Japan and Vietnam, as a result of negotiations in Vichy, a new Japan-Vietnam settlement agreement was signed, aimed at supplementing the Japan-Vietnam economic agreement concluded in May of the previous year, the joint defense agreement concluded in July of the same year, and the military agreement of December of the same year.</p>
<p>The signing date was also January 20, which is not only limited to establishing Japan-Vietnam economic relations, but also has determined the best policy for trade and settlement between various parts of Greater East Asia and Vietnam. According to the Tripartite Pact and the current Three-Nation Economic Agreement, Germany and Italy can respect Japan's position in guiding the construction of the new order in East Asia, and at the same time the French government can follow Germany and Italy in respecting Japan.</p>
<p>In the future, the cooperation between the three countries will become closer, and each will seek to improve its position in the world. Europe and Asia will advance together, guiding the construction of the new order in the East and West. (Ren: Translated from the January 23rd Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<p>Part 2</p>
<p>Regarding the agreement on economic cooperation between Japan and Germany and between Japan and Italy, it was signed and sealed by representatives of each country in Berlin and Rome on the 20th of this month and took effect on the same day.</p>
<p>After the establishment of this agreement, the political connection and economic cooperation established by the Japan-Germany-Italy Tripartite Pact will be expanded and strengthened. From this, the total power of the two major economic spheres of Greater East Asia and Europe can be brought together to defeat the common enemy, Britain and the United States, in order to ensure the final victory. At the same time, even after the war, the permanent cooperation of the two major economic spheres will make it possible to build a new order in Greater East Asia and Europe, in order to promote the coexistence and co-prosperity of the various nations, and to establish the foundation for a broad construction plan; therefore, its significance is very significant and it is a groundbreaking agreement for the Axis powers to complete the war and build after the war.</p>
<p>Britain and the United States use the means of blockading the seas to deal with the Axis powers, so that they will consume wartime materials and thus succumb to them. This is the first goal of their operations. However, the sea and air power of the Axis powers has broken through the enemy's blockade network everywhere. Since the start of the war, the loss of British and American ships has reached as high as 20 million tons, so the enemy itself has sunk into the tragic situation of counter-blockade. On the one hand, Germany and Italy in Europe, due to economic cooperation with friendly countries and the securing of the development of vast occupied territories, are gradually expanding their power, in order to strengthen their wartime positions without any regrets. On the other hand, Japan has occupied the world's treasure house of the South, and has collected unlimited wartime resources into its hands, creating a foundation of self-sufficiency that can withstand any long-term war.</p>
<p>Former US Ambassador to Japan Grew warned the US government and public not to underestimate Japan's national power. He pointed out that Japan's consumption of combat power during the four years of the China Incident was actually an accumulation for the Greater East Asia War, not a consumption. Now that Japan holds the resources of the South, when it realizes development and operation in the future, it will inevitably become the world's largest resource country. He therefore emphasized the danger of a protracted war, urging the US authorities to make fundamental revisions to their war policy, and urging the public to rise up. We dare to say that Japan has long become an unparalleled power in the world, and has become the world's largest resource country, and it is not necessary for Grew to point this out. Now Japan, Germany, and Italy, with these vast two major economic spheres of Asia and Europe, can share resources and technology, and have established a consistent long-term plan for wartime and after the war. Our victory in the Axis powers is inevitable, and this agreement is a great light torch for the future of the construction of the new order in Europe and Asia, which is especially gratifying.

<h3>Soviet Troops Continue Offensive, Eastern Front War Shifts South, Seemingly Aiming to Seize Rostov, Main Force of German Troops in Caucasus Retreats Safely</h3>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Haitong News Agency) - The war in the central sector of the Eastern Front seems to have evolved into a major battle in the southern sector. The Soviet offensive is now extending southward from northwest of Voronezh, with considerable forces. Whether the purpose is to advance towards the Donets Basin and Rostov is not yet clear. The Soviet attempt to cut off the main railway line from the Kupyansk area to Rostov has not been abandoned, but the Soviets have made little progress in the past week and have failed to achieve their goal. German resistance east of the lower Don and south of the Manych is extremely strong, which has greatly helped the German transfer to new positions in the Caucasus. Therefore, the main force of the German troops has not suffered any losses. The heroic resistance of the German troops in Stalingrad is also of great importance, because if the German 6th Army did not make a heroic resistance to contain the Soviet offensive southward from the Volga Bay, the German retreat in the Caucasus would have been in danger of being cut off. Now this crisis has been avoided.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Haitong News Agency) - According to today's news, there are fierce battles on the entire Eastern Front. Soviet troops launched fierce attacks in the West Caucasus all day long, with no progress. There were no major battles between the Don and Donets rivers. The two armies continued to fight fiercely in the city of Stalingrad, with heavy Soviet losses. A Soviet detachment southeast of Lake Ilmen was encircled and annihilated. Soviet troops launched fierce attacks south of Lake Ladoga, but failed.</p>
<h3>Correction</h3>
<p>Yesterday's (27th) international special urgent telegram "Enemy planes blindly bomb Saigon" was actually a mistake for "Enemy planes blindly bomb Rangoon." We hereby make a solemn correction. (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Limited Price for Retail Goods, Procedure Under Consideration, Control Department Fully Preparing</h3>
<p>Since the Public Works Department and the Bureau of Foreign Affairs stipulated that the price of goods sold by manufacturers and wholesalers in the two concessions should not exceed the limit of the 23rd of this month from the 24th of this month, people from all walks of life are still doubtful about whether the authorities will adopt new restriction methods for retail prices, which are most closely related to buyers. According to our reporter's investigation from well-informed sources, the concession authorities are determined to gradually limit the retail prices of goods based on the limited prices of manufacturing and wholesale in implementation, or to restrict them by directly ordering independent methods. It is still under consideration. On the one hand, the price and cost calculation of goods sold by manufacturers and wholesalers on the 23rd of this month must be reported to the authorities for approval until the 10th of next month. On the other hand, this matter involves a lot, and there must be sufficient preparation time. However, in any case, the retail price will tend to stabilize, which is undeniable. Before the new system of restricting retail prices is implemented, the Material Control Department of the two concession authorities will intensify its investigation work, so that the 10,000 kinds of goods that have already been limited in price can always be sold in accordance with the limited price. Stores that violate the limited price will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>500 Million Yuan Food Treasury Bills to be Issued on February 9</h3>
<p>In order to absorb idle funds, the financial authorities have decided to issue 500 million yuan of food treasury bills, which will be sold by the Central Reserve Bank. They are divided into two types, A and B. Type A is 400 million yuan, which is specially used to purchase food, and Type B is 100 million yuan, which is used to build food storage warehouses. The issuance date of these food treasury bills has been decided to be February 9, which is the fifth day of the Lunar New Year, that is, the first day when the banks resume business after the Spring Festival holiday.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Urges Re-Registration of Rickshaws</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Works Department started the inspection of rickshaw licenses in the concession in September last year. In order to consider the poor rickshaw operators, a special supplementary inspection method was specified and implemented in November last year. However, there are still more than 3,000 vehicles left, so rickshaw operators should be allowed to re-register and various methods should be set. The main points are excerpted as follows: (1) These methods are revised in accordance with Article 12 of the Rickshaw Inspection Methods. (2) There are currently 3,694 license quotas remaining. When the quota is full, the Municipal Public Works Department may refuse to register and issue licenses. (3) Re-registration dates: (A) For vehicles whose licenses have been revoked in 1942, from February 1 to February 15. (B) For vehicles without licenses, from February 16 to February 28. (4) The wheels of vehicles whose licenses have been revoked in 1942 must register and request inspection within the date specified in Article 3, and return the old licenses. (5) Rickshaw operators must apply for registration at the nearest Municipal Public Works License Office within the time limit and report to the General Office. The General Office will send personnel to the original registration office on the specified date to inspect the vehicles. If the first inspection fails, the General Office will inform the rickshaw operator of the shortcomings, and the rickshaw operator shall re-register after modification. Vehicles that fail the second inspection will not be allowed to register permanently. (6) After the vehicle passes the inspection, the rickshaw operator must find a guarantor, affix a steel stamp, and pay a registration fee of 2 yuan and a license fee of 55 cents. Each vehicle owner pays 5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Fourth Phase of Sugar Sales Starts Today, Third Phase Ended Yesterday, No Supplementary Purchase Allowed</h3>
<p>The Sugar Merchants Cooperative has decided to issue the fourth phase of sugar sales in advance and appropriately increase the quantity. However, sugar will be temporarily sold with housing donation tickets. It is stipulated that each retailer is allowed to receive housing donation tickets and sell sugar on odd and even days. Each housing donation ticket is allowed to purchase about 12 catties of sugar, and a retail donation of 2% is added. Retailers will close their accounts and take a holiday at the end of the period, with odd days being from February 3 to 8 and even days being from February 4 to 9. Before the end of the period, retailers selling sugar on odd and even days will handle sugar sales once. (1) Stores on odd days will receive housing donation tickets today and sell sugar on February 2. (2) Stores on even days will receive housing donation tickets tomorrow and sell sugar on February 3. The receipt of housing donation tickets for the third phase of sugar sales ended yesterday, and no supplementary purchase is allowed after the deadline. Those who received housing donation tickets on the last day yesterday are allowed to sell sugar on January 31. The Cooperative solemnly declared to Shanghai News Agency reporter yesterday that although the current method of purchasing sugar with housing donation tickets is that it is often impossible to receive the purchased sugar on the same day and it takes until the fourth day to receive it, the procedure seems more troublesome, but this method can completely eliminate the malpractices of retailers and prevent sugar from being transferred to peddlers for black market transactions. The door price has been seen in yesterday's newspaper.</p>
<h3>New Director-General of Public Works Department Holds Grand Banquet</h3>
<p>According to the Public Works Department Information Office, the newly appointed Director-General of the Department, Mr. Ozawa Narimichi, held a banquet at the Japanese Club on Zhaowen Road yesterday. The invited guests included senior officers of the Japanese Army and Navy, diplomatic corps, and representatives of the consular corps, directors of the French Concession Board of Directors, directors of the Public Works Department, members of various committees, municipal authorities and personnel of various agencies, officials of the Japanese Embassy and Consular Office, directors of various departments of the Public Works Department, and many reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers.</p>
<h3>Overshoes Stop Selling on Sunny Days</h3>
<p>Recently, some people have been buying and reselling overshoes on the market, resulting in black market price increases and frequent disputes. Therefore, rubber factories such as Dachunghua have formulated temporary sales methods, stopping sales on sunny days. If they are formal users, they must be sold with a housing donation ticket and a citizen's card or residence permit that matches the person. As for wholesale, it is distributed in proportion to the past sales volume of each retail store. New and informal stores are rejected for wholesale.</p>
<h3>Negotiations on the Recovery of Concessions, Foreign Minister Chu Discusses with Relevant Authorities, Necessary Preparations for Takeover Underway</h3>
<p>Foreign Minister Chu Minyi recently made a business trip to Shanghai. When he left Shanghai to return to Beijing earlier this week, he told a reporter from the English-language "Great American Evening Post" that since China's participation in the war, satisfactory progress has been made in the negotiations on the recovery of the concessions, especially the Shanghai Public Concession. During his short stay in Shanghai, he met with the Japanese Army, Navy, and other relevant authorities to discuss the concession issue, and the results were very satisfactory. He will come to Shanghai again soon to continue negotiations on the recovery of the Public Concession. At the same time, the necessary preparations for the takeover of the Public Concession are underway. According to reports, Chu personally contacted the local authorities in Shanghai in his capacity as Foreign Minister to discuss the concessions and related issues during his trip to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Rural Area Household Registration Investigation Rules, Starting from the 30th for One Month, Middle-Aged Men with No Reason to Reside, All Sent Back to Their Place of Origin or Arrested Directly</h3>
<p>In order to ensure the security of the Shanghai Rural Area and thoroughly complete the Baojia organization, the Shanghai Rural Area Branch has specially formulated the "Shanghai First Phase Rural Area Household Registration Investigation Implementation Rules", and circulated them for implementation, and repealed the previously issued "Shanghai Rural Area Implementation Rules". According to the new rules, a Household Registration Investigation Implementation Committee is established as the guiding agency for the implementation of household registration investigation matters. The investigation implementation period is scheduled from January 20 to February 20, 1943, and may be extended if necessary. The implementation steps are carried out in stages by region. During the household registration investigation, the household registration investigation team will conduct door-to-door investigation. It is stipulated that each household is limited to relatives with the same surname living together. If they are relatives and friends, except for women and men under the age of 12 or over the age of 60, they must not live together unless there is a special reason and it is approved, and they must not be included in the same household registration. All men of different surnames and without families between the ages of 12 and 60, except for (1) those who are indeed public officials and their staff, (2) those who are indeed in a permanent commercial relationship and employment relationship, (3) those who have a special relationship with the military or secret service and have been approved, (4) monks who have been approved, will be</p>
<p>sent back to their place of origin or arrested directly. If the person is not at home during the household registration investigation, they will not be included in the household registration. If they go to other places for special reasons and return after the investigation, they may be allowed to be included in the household registration after the joint guarantee application of the township, town, and Baojia heads and after approval. Those who deliberately do not stay at home and reside without being included in the household registration will be punished as bandits if they are found out. Those who cohabit without reporting will be punished as harboring bandits. After the household registration investigation is completed, a residence permit will be issued uniformly. After that, random checks and rechecks will be carried out at any time. The time for the household registration investigation is scheduled to be carried out during the day from 7:00 am to 6:00 pm. After the end of the investigation, the Household Registration Investigation Implementation Committee will be dissolved.</p>
<h3>Strict Supervision of Various Industries, Inspection of Business Books</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Industry issued the Provisional Regulations on Supervising Privately-Operated Industries and Markets, if there are violations of laws and regulations, manipulation, hoarding, and other abnormal behaviors, they may be punished according to the severity of the circumstances, such as dissolving the market, suspending the market's business, or suspending or prohibiting a part of the market's business. Brokers or agent members who intentionally raise or suppress prices, resulting in inappropriate values, and other improper or illegal behaviors may be expelled or otherwise punished. The authorities have sent personnel to inspect the business books and sales situation of various markets in order to implement supervision of privately-operated markets.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Changing Title Deeds May be Extended by One Month</h3>
<p>The deadline for applying for the lifting of enemy property disposal has been set for February 9. However, "China Intelligence" reports that although the application period for lifting the original enemy-named title deeds will expire on the 9th of next month, the registration deadline for changing the name on the title deeds may be extended by one month.</p>

<h3>After Unified Distribution of Cigarettes, Strictly Prohibit Retail Sales Exceeding the Limited Price, Considering Current Needs, Distribute Goods to the Market, Purchase Raw Materials and Set Official Cigarette Prices</h3>
<p>In order to unify the distribution of Japanese and Chinese cigarettes and effectively implement the limited price, the China Central Tobacco Distribution Association has limited the deadline for registering cigarette merchants throughout the city to January 31. Those who refuse to register after the deadline will be regarded as voluntarily giving up the right to distribution. After the examination is completed, distribution will be controlled according to the actual sales situation of each merchant. The distribution of goods from Yongtaihe Tobacco Company, China Tobacco Company, and various Chinese cigarette factories will be transferred to the Association for centralized distribution. As for the cigarette raw materials needed by the factories, the China Central Tobacco Leaf Distribution Association will uniformly purchase and distribute them to maintain needs.</p>
<p>Unified Distribution of Cigarettes from Various Factories</p>
<p>The China Central Tobacco Distribution Association is an organization jointly invested and organized by Gu Central Tobacco Company, a military-managed company, Japanese-owned China Tobacco Company, and more than 20 Chinese factories such as Huacheng, Nanyang, Fuxin, Datong, Huamei, and Datongnan. From now on, the cigarettes produced by each factory will be controlled by the Association. Legal profits will be given according to the cost of various cigarettes, and limited prices will be set separately to distribute to various merchants. At the same time, 300 large companies will be designated and entrusted to handle the retail distribution of various small companies, and handling fees will be given. It is stipulated that wholesale and retail must be in strict accordance with the official attached price, and black market price increase transactions are strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibit Retail Sales Exceeding the Limited Price</p>
<p>Huayuan Tobacco Company, which manages the distribution of goods, issued a notice to various retail cigarette merchants, saying, "It has been found that some retail cigarette merchants have exceeded the distribution price when selling cigarettes. Such greed for huge profits not only violates the original intention of selling at a flat price, but also helps to promote speculation and hoarding. Each merchant should hang the assessed retail price in a conspicuous place for the attention of customers. If there is any violation of the authorities' policy of stabilizing prices, once found out, the right to distribute cigarettes will be cancelled and investigated." In addition, it is hoped that citizens will report at any time to punish them.</p>
<p>Considering the Needs, Distribute Goods to the Market</p>
<p>The distribution of goods by the Distribution Association will begin after the end of the general settlement of various industries. After that, it will be distributed at any time according to the actual sales needs in the market. As for other parts of Central China, it will also be distributed by the Association. A unified distribution method has been agreed upon. After implementation, the cigarette black market will inevitably be completely eliminated. In order to take care of current needs, the original distribution agencies will temporarily distribute goods to the market. For example, Huayuan Tobacco Company has handled the 13th phase of distribution: (1) Distribution of goods to retail merchants will be from the 26th to the 28th of this month for a total of three days. (2) Distribution of goods to large companies will be from the 28th to the 29th of this month for two days. The goods distributed are brands such as Quanlu, Red Rose, Gold Gun, Double Axe, and Mount Fuji.</p>
<h3>Low-Priced Flour for the Poor in the West of Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Wheat Flour Control and Distribution Association, together with the West Shanghai Poor Relief Association, started the first phase of flour sales for the poor in the West Shanghai area yesterday. The numbers of the grain stores are: (1) Taifeng on Rue Robert, (2) Yongxing on Yidingpan Road, (3) Renfeng on Belignan Road. Each certificate sells two catties of low-priced flour, totaling 3 yuan and 60 cents in national currency.</p>
<h3>Student Aid Fund Elementary School Exam Papers Awaiting Final Review, Personnel Currently Dispatched to Investigate Family Circumstances, Middle School Exam Papers Being Graded Overnight</h3>
<p>The Fourth Annual *Shen Bao* Readers' Student Aid Fund for elementary and middle school students has completed its examinations. The elementary school group's over eight hundred exam papers have been graded. Personnel are now being dispatched to investigate each student's family circumstances to serve as a reference for the final review. Once the procedures are completed, the names of all students receiving aid and the amount of aid will be announced in this newspaper. The middle school group had over sixteen hundred applicants, and their exam papers are being graded overnight. Investigation and review procedures will be handled subsequently. During this period, if any student has changed schools or experienced an increase or decrease in tuition fees, they should immediately attach supporting documents and promptly send a letter to the Student Aid Fund office of this newspaper stating the changes.</p>
<p>All Sectors Concerned About Aid Fund, Students Should Not Be Disappointed</p>
<p>This newspaper's handling of this year's student aid has no dedicated funding. It relies solely on the enthusiasm and sympathy of all sectors, with temporary donations. For the past three years, fortunately, we have not failed the expectations of all sectors and the hopes of applying students. This is truly a precious manifestation of the resonance between this newspaper and its readers. The timeframe for this year's aid fund was extremely tight, and financial resources were also relatively strained. However, enthusiastic readers still braved wind and snow to personally bring donations to the office. Such a spirit of helping the world is a full expression of the highest and noblest sympathy. It is deeply believed that all sectors will continue to donate successively, so that those applying students with excellent grades this year will not have the regret of being disappointed. In addition to our service, we should express our gratitude to all the donating gentlemen.</p>
<p>Aid Fund Budget</p>
<p>Regarding the elementary school student aid fund, Yiji and Yuji generously donated 20,000 yuan the other day, instructing us to give special assistance to the elementary school group. Therefore, for the elementary school portion of over eight hundred students, except for those who do not meet the academic requirements, we can manage to allocate the aid fund under difficult circumstances to barely cope. If there are continued donations, even more people can be enabled to attend school. However, the number of middle school students is more than double that of elementary school students, and the tuition fees are several times higher than those of elementary schools. After careful selection, it is estimated that the middle school portion of the aid fund will be short by at least seventy to eighty thousand yuan. The university portion has not yet been reviewed, but it is generally estimated to be short by thirty to forty thousand yuan. If we can continue to receive donations of aid funds from all parties immediately, adding more than one hundred thousand yuan, then even if we cannot cover all tuition fees for impoverished students this year, we can barely fulfill the hopes of outstanding impoverished students. The above estimates are based only on the most basic estimates and do not dictate the allocation of aid funds at the time of disbursement. More donations will lead to more assistance, and we hope that people in society will contribute to this effort.</p>
<p>Saving Money to Donate Paintings, Enthusiastically Advocating</p>
<p>This newspaper received a letter from (1) Yude Jun yesterday, saying, "I quickly read the news about the student aid fund in your esteemed newspaper. I am sincerely impressed by the enthusiastic service of your esteemed newspaper's colleagues and the gentlemen of the Youth Association, who are not afraid of wind and snow. No wonder people are rising up and donating enthusiastically. I am not talented, but I believe that in these extraordinary times, spending during the New Year is extremely wasteful. I respectfully donate 1,000 yuan in savings to your esteemed newspaper's student aid fund. If this can attract attention and response from all sectors, then turning the useless into the useful, bringing blessings to relatives and friends and society, is a matter of immediacy." (2) The painter Dai Cangqi wrote, "I recently read your esteemed newspaper and learned with respect that this year's student aid fund may not be sufficient to provide universal relief due to the small amount of funds and the large number of students. I am now presenting a two-foot vertical scroll of meticulously mounted flowers, hoping that your esteemed office will appeal to all sectors. If kind and generous elders can generously donate 2,000 yuan or more, so that impoverished students can cross to the other shore, I will present my humble work to promote benevolence and leave a memento."</p>
<p>Free School Places, Donations Abundant</p>
<p>This newspaper continued to receive letters yesterday, donating free school places. (1) Mr. Yin Ziling wrote, "I recently learned that there are an unprecedented number of applicants for your esteemed newspaper's student aid fund, making allocation difficult. As my late father, Mr. Zuzhai, valued education and promoted students during his lifetime, I am donating five full-tuition-free places in the junior middle school section and ten full-tuition-free places in the senior elementary school section (including book fees) of Jinghua Elementary and Middle School. Please select outstanding students and send them with a letter of recommendation to promote their development." (2) Wu Lie, Principal of Nanguang Middle School, wrote, "In consideration of impoverished students continuing their education, our school is offering twenty half-fee places in the third grade of junior middle school for the next semester. Please select outstanding students and send them to our school to study." (3) The Municipal Hua Elementary School wrote, "In order to support your esteemed organization's enthusiastic and righteous actions, our school is offering five free places in the senior grades. Please recommend students with excellent grades to our school, and they will be approved for free admission (excluding book and miscellaneous fees)." (4) "Our school has always been eager to help impoverished students and will do our best. We respectfully request your esteemed newspaper to recommend five free places each for the first and second grades of junior middle school and all grades of elementary school," Zhi Xing Night Elementary and Middle School (Our school has already moved to No. 366, Fuzi Elementary School, South Songshan Road, Bailan Road). (5) "Who would not be moved by reading your esteemed newspaper's news about helping impoverished children to maintain the foundation of the country? Our school does not have the financial strength to donate cash to your esteemed newspaper to benefit impoverished children. We can only add some places in our school classrooms to express our heartfelt feelings. We are willing to offer five free places each in the second, third, and fourth grades of the elementary section. Please recommend students, preferably those who live near our school," Zhao Chunyi, Principal of Gongyi Elementary School, No. 741, Lane, Chengdu Road, Aiwenyi Road.</p>

<h3>Central Trust to Establish Nanyang Exchange Bureau</h3>
<p>To Facilitate Remittances from Overseas Chinese to Support Families and Invest in the Motherland</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, transportation between this port and various parts of Nanyang has been temporarily suspended. Although transportation has gradually resumed since last autumn, due to the scarcity of ships and the lack of exchange between Shanghai and Nanyang, not only have overseas Chinese merchants in this port been unable to resume business, but some have also found it difficult to maintain their livelihoods. According to sources, the Overseas Chinese Affairs authorities and the Japanese Embassy have recently been negotiating to facilitate remittances from overseas Chinese to support their families and to facilitate investment in the country by overseas Chinese. As a result, it was decided to establish a Nanyang Exchange Bureau within the Central Reserve Bank, specializing in handling remittances from overseas Chinese in various parts of Nanyang back to the country. It is reported that the amount of remittances is limited to those supporting families, that is, 600 yuan can be remitted for one family member, and 1,000 yuan for two. The details of other remittances have not yet been decided.</p>
<h3>Anti-British and American Association to Hold War Participation Speech and Film</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese National Anti-British and American Association, in view of the great significance of the government's participation in the war, to clarify the relationship between participation in the war and the people, and to mobilize the masses to jointly cooperate in the Greater East Asia War, has specifically scheduled a war participation speech and film conference to be held at the Great Light Theater at 2:00 p.m. on the 31st of this month (Sunday). Prominent Chinese and Japanese figures Lin Kanghou, Li Quanshi, Yoshida Toyu, Chen Bin, and Zhang Yipeng have been invited to speak, and the anti-British film "Flower Girl," starring Li Lihua, will be screened. All sectors are welcome to attend the lectures.

<h3>Financial Institutions Not Allowed to Engage in Business Outside of Prescribed Scope, Must Complete Closure by September 17</h3>
<p>Financial institutions such as banks and money shops engaged in deposit, loan, bill discounting, and exchange pledge businesses have recently received an order from the Ministry of Finance stipulating that their business scope is limited to the solicitation, underwriting, or trading of securities, warehousing or safekeeping businesses, and acting as agents for other financial institutions and for monetary receipts and disbursements. They are absolutely not allowed to engage in other businesses. Those who were engaged in businesses outside of the prescribed scope before the implementation of the Interim Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions should close such businesses within one year from the implementation of the detailed rules of the measures. The announcement of the detailed rules was on September 18 of last year, so all concurrent businesses not permitted by laws and regulations must be completely closed before September 17 of this year to comply with the laws and regulations.</p>

<h3>Central Trust Company Expands Various Businesses</h3>
<p>The Central Trust Company, Limited, was specially established by the Central Reserve Bank in accordance with the instructions of the National Government. Since its opening, it has adopted prudent measures based on the principle of supporting industry and commerce. Therefore, its various trust, savings, and insurance businesses have been developing extremely rapidly. It is reported that the company's year-end balance for the 31st year showed a surplus of more than 5 million yuan in national currency. At present, the company's total trust deposits have reached more than 46 million yuan, total savings deposits have reached more than 19 million yuan, and the total amount of fire insurance underwritten is close to 300 million yuan. The speed of its business development is evident. This year, in order to expand its business, the trust businesses that have been prescribed but not yet implemented will be gradually put into practice, and it is planned to add trust interest-bearing deposits. In terms of savings, various savings such as fixed deposits with withdrawals and zero deposits with lump-sum payments will be added to facilitate depositors' savings. As for insurance affairs, in addition to the original fire insurance for this and other places, it is planned to gradually launch other types of insurance in order to maximize the performance of the Central Trust Company.</p>
<h3>The Way to Preserve Wealth (8)</h3>
<p>— Nie Yuntai</p>
<p>The teachings of Chinese sages, whether Confucian, Buddhist, or Taoist, repeatedly and earnestly explain this principle. The *I Ching* says, "The Way of Heaven diminishes excess and benefits humility; the Way of Earth transforms excess and flows to humility; ghosts and spirits bring misfortune to excess and fortune to humility; the Way of Man hates excess and loves humility." The *Book of Documents* says, "Fullness invites loss, humility receives benefit; this is the Way of Heaven." The *Book of Documents* also says, "Only Heaven blesses the good and brings calamity to the wicked." The word "wicked" here does not refer only to sexual desire, but to the indulgence and excess of all things, which can be said to be arrogance and fullness. To be more specific, it refers to extravagance, licentiousness, greed, violence, and tyranny (classical texts often use the term "wicked" to encompass many meanings). These evil deeds will naturally lead to unexpected disasters. The opposite of "wicked" is "good," and the meaning of "good" is very broad. To explain it precisely, all good deeds contain the meaning of humility and are based on humility. The *I Ching* is a book that explains the Way of Heaven, and the Qian and Kun hexagrams are the general principles of the Way of Heaven. The Qian hexagram says, "Able to benefit the world without mentioning the benefit." This is the meaning of humility. The Kun hexagram says, "Although Kun has beauty, it contains it; or it serves the king, but does not dare to complete it." These three sentences mean that talent is not revealed, and merit is not claimed, that is, not pursuing fame and not boasting of achievements, which is also the meaning of humility. The *Diamond Sutra* says that all beings are liberated, but one does not feel that they have been liberated. It also says that one gives alms to help the masses, but does not feel that one has given. This is the highest morality in the world, and it also contains humility. Furthermore, the eight virtues of filial piety, brotherly respect, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame all emphasize a sense of duty and de-emphasize the pursuit of rights. A sense of duty means that one feels that one still has an obligation to fulfill, and this is humility. Those who do evil in the world are merely those who have a strong sense of rights and no sense of duty, who always want to take advantage of others and lack the heart to help others.</p>
<p>The ancient saying "emphasizing profit and de-emphasizing righteousness" is the opposite of humility. Therefore, all virtues are contained within humility. When humility is activated, it becomes filial piety and brotherly respect towards parents and siblings, and loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame towards society and the masses. All people are respectful and happy towards humility and good deeds, and resentful and hate evil deeds. Therefore, Heaven bestows blessings and calamities. Saying that it is the Way of Heaven is actually human sentiment; saying that it is bestowed by Heaven is actually self-made. The above has already said that the Way of Heaven is the manifestation of human affairs. The *Book of Documents* says, "Heaven sees as the people see, and Heaven hears as the people hear." The *Surangama Sutra* says, "If one causes beings to be happy, then one causes all Tathagatas to be happy." (The explanation of Tathagata is the supreme meaning of Heaven, which is the supreme heavenly principle. To unite the mind with heavenly principle is called achieving enlightenment, also called becoming a Buddha, also called Tathagata.) Therefore, when we do good and bring blessings to others, we will naturally receive blessings; when we do evil and harm others, we will naturally receive calamity. From this, we can know that all people and things facing us are Heaven. There is no other Heaven besides this, nor is there any other principle.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must be especially careful and pay attention to our actions, words, thoughts, and expressions towards them. Although they may be foolish, cowardly, old, weak, orphans, or widows, and no one helps them, if we bully them, we ourselves or our descendants will also be foolish, cowardly, orphaned, widowed, and bullied in the near future. Conversely, if we have compassion for these powerless and pitiful people and try to help them, we will also receive help from others, and our descendants will never be foolish, cowardly, orphaned, widowed, and bullied. Those with wise eyes can naturally observe this cycle of karmic retribution in the human affairs of each family in society and can further prove it by the results of each ancient good and evil person in history. I will now cite one or two examples of the consequences of each kind of fact, such as doing something that benefits the masses or harms the masses, as our encouragement and warning, which I will explain in the following article. (End)</p>
<p>This article was completed in April and I immediately coughed up blood and was bedridden. The doctor said that I need long-term rest to recover, so the next article may be difficult to continue writing. I would be grateful if virtuous people at home and abroad could write it for me. Yuntai wrote in bed.</p>
<p>Postscript</p>
<p>Mr. Nie's masterpiece is finished today. In the middle, we repeatedly received letters from readers expressing their willingness to fund the printing of a separate book for distribution and publicity. This shows that inspiring goodness is naturally in people's hearts. Readers who wish to contribute to the printing can contact the Social Service Department of this newspaper. Please ask Mr. Bai Yun and Shen Meisun to be responsible for handling it.</p>
<h3>Annual Report of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Supplies Control Office for the Last Year (1)</h3>
<p>Last year, the Bureau's work on the control of goods and prices saw a significant increase. This work was carried out by a special committee, which was established at the beginning of last year and named the Food Supply Committee, with seven members, chaired by Mr. Godown. The committee was subsequently renamed the Price Control Committee, and finally the Supplies Control Committee, with fifteen members, still chaired by Mr. Godown. The Chinese members included Mr. Huang Guanping, Mr. Zhao Jinqing, Mr. Cai Ziren, and Mr. Pan Jie.</p>
<p>Food Supply In the past year, all the rice purchased and stored by the Bureau was distributed to residents in April. Since then, the rice needed by the citizens has been supplied by the Japanese authorities. The liaison and distribution work is handled by the supply section specially organized by the Bureau. As for the flour purchased by the Bureau, it was also distributed by the end of June. Thereafter, the flour needed was also purchased from the Japanese authorities. Regarding rice and flour, one point to note is that the Bureau not only purchased for the residents of the International Settlement, but also purchased on behalf of the residents of the French Concession and for the bread eaters in western Shanghai. In addition, due to the need to purchase rice and flour, the Bureau registered sacks and hemp ropes in September.</p>
<p>Food Distribution The Bureau expanded the measures it had taken in the second half of last year to control the stocks, prices, movement, and distribution of major commodities, further purchasing all stocks of flour, corn, butter, and canned milk, while restricting the movement of wheat, barley, sorghum, starch, fat, fish oil, and soda.</p>
<p>By the end of April, the entire stock of foreign rice had been purchased and distributed. Thereafter, the Bureau relied on the Japanese authorities to supply this most important grain to the residents of the settlement. At that time, imports of rice from other sources were prohibited, and the distribution of grain was solely the responsibility of the Bureau. All the rice distributed by the Bureau throughout the year was retailed by rice shops at regulated prices. The price gradually increased from 1 yuan and 3 jiao and 7 fen per liter in January, and also rose to 2 yuan and 5 jiao and 3 fen per liter in May, and so on to this day.</p>
<p>The corn purchased by the Bureau was mostly ground into broken corn after rolling and milling, and sold together with rice to increase the amount of rice per household. The remaining corn was ground into fine flour, and flour product factories were once forced to use corn flour to bake bread and other pasta products.</p>
<p>Flour was sold by the Bureau to bakeries, noodle shops, and pancake shops at regulated prices. The prices of the products of these shops were all limited by the Bureau. At the end of the year, the retail price of flour was 2 yuan and 6 fen per pound, and the retail price of bread was 2 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen per pound.</p>
<p>The flour purchased by the Bureau was distributed by the end of June without remainder, as mentioned above. The flour needed in the second half of the year was supplied by the Japanese authorities. Not only did it enable the Bureau to continue to distribute flour to bakeries, noodle shops, and pancake and fried dough stick shops, but also, from July, flour was issued to Chinese residents according to household registration.</p>
<p>After the stocks of butter and canned milk were purchased, they were also distributed by the Bureau in the same way. The butter stock has now been exhausted, but canned milk is still distributed based on doctors' prescriptions.</p>
<p>Among the various measures taken by the Bureau to ensure the fair distribution of major commodities, the most effective was the distribution of grain by population, which began on July 6. According to this count, about 1.3 million Chinese residents in the settlement were able to receive a rice ticket per person, and purchase household rice and flour from rice shops with the ticket. The price was set by the Bureau every ten days, which was convenient for the citizens. There were 463 rice shops in the settlement that sold household rice and flour. Before the sale, the Bureau pre-allocated rice and flour to each rice shop. Each rice shop had a contract with the Bureau, allowing only the sale of household rice and flour with tickets. Rice and flour tickets were issued to residents in batches by the Bureau's certificate issuing offices. Since the implementation of this plan, the practice of squeezing rice has been completely eliminated and has not been seen again. Bread has also adopted a distribution system.</p>

<h3>Recent Silver and Money Industry in Shanghai (2)</h3>
<p>— Zhu Guilin</p>
<p>(2) Recent Trends in the Silver and Money Industry</p>
<p>The way out for the silver and money industry in Shanghai is as described above, and this deformed situation is a hidden worry for wartime finance. Therefore, in August of the 31st year, Minister Zhou Cai promulgated 19 articles of the Interim Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions to consolidate the national finance. In addition to stipulating that all silver and money businesses should register with the Ministry, the most important point is to strictly prohibit speculation, stipulating that each firm and shop shall not engage in (1) futures trading of securities and commodities, (2) hoarding and speculation, and other speculative transactions. Financial institutions themselves shall not acquire movable or immovable property for investment or transaction purposes, except for business needs or for receiving collateral for debt repayment. At the same time, the prices were strictly limited, and manipulation was strictly prohibited. Therefore, it seems that there is no possibility of development for the silver and money industry on the surface, but the newly opened firms and shops in Shanghai are like bamboo shoots after rain. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, no less than dozens of new firms and shops were established. This abnormal situation will inevitably repeat the chaos of the Min Ba Xin Jiao trend. The newly established firms and shops can profit temporarily under this jagged state, but it is not easy to seek long-term and lasting success and stand in an invincible position. However, since the Ministry of Finance restricted the establishment of financial institutions, the entire finance has become stable. (End)</p>
<h3>Company Bond Trading Concentrated in Category C</h3>
<p>Due to the strong performance of various Chinese merchant stocks yesterday, the market sentiment for government bonds also slightly improved. However, the five types of government bonds showed a clear divergence, with only Category C being actively bid up. Other categories suffered from a lack of buyers. For example, the difference between Category D and Category C was five yuan, yet there were still no buyers for Category D. The difference between Category E and Category C was three yuan, but Category C was difficult to acquire, and Category E was difficult to sell. This extremely distorted situation demonstrates that market sentiment is not universally optimistic, as buying and selling are concentrated in Category C. Yesterday, Category C rose from 8.12 yuan to 9.20 yuan, eventually settling at 8.89 yuan, a gain of 35 cents. Category A was at 6.50 yuan, Category B at 5.78 yuan, Category D at 4.20 yuan, and Category E at 6 yuan. These four categories were lower than the previous day, with a still uncertain trend. Sudden tightening of interest rates.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the money trade association's call loan rate suddenly posted a slight two-point increase, to 1.5 cents. The money supply in the market has gradually eased recently, which is attributed to the effective regulation by the money trade, it is said.</p>
<h3>Sudden Easing of Call Loan Rate, Revised to 1.5 Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, military notes trended weakly again, with interbank trading at 5.5523 yuan. Money shops and silver houses quoted buying and selling prices at 5.55 yuan and 5.56 yuan. United Reserve Bank notes rose by two or three cents, with traders selling at 3.93 yuan and buying at 3.87 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Soybean Cakes Being Sold at Discounted Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the grain market remained quiet. With soybean cakes being sold on speculation, buyers were hesitant. Yuan Long's cakes were reduced to 95 or 96 yuan but saw little trading.</p>
<h3>Cloth Market Hovering</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market trended generally flat, with prices hovering and slightly firm. "Four Gentlemen" broadcloth opened at 10.60 yuan, with a low of 10.55 yuan. By 10:00 AM, it had rebounded to 10.90 yuan. Dyed cloth, peach lady's clothing, was at 4.56 yuan, with spot goods at 4.70 yuan. Xie Yu Mansion silk was at 11.50 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hua Yuan Continues to Distribute Goods, Cigarette Market Softens</h3>
<p>The cigarette market showed signs of softening due to Hua Yuan's distribution of fourth-class "Da Tong Hang" cigarettes yesterday, which dampened market sentiment. Consequently, trading prices showed weakness. British American Tobacco's "Da Ying" brand was priced at 12,400 yuan, "Old Knife" brand at 10,400 yuan, "Pin Hai" brand at 7,700 yuan, "Wu Hua" brand at 6,800 yuan, "Fairy" brand at 80 yuan, Japanese "Golden Gun" brand at 5,700 yuan, "Red Rose" brand at 2,650 yuan, "Quan Lu" brand at 3,400 yuan, "20-Stick" brand at 2,900 yuan, "Compass" brand at 2,850 yuan, "National Cigarette Pyramid" brand at 6,450 yuan, "Beautiful" brand at 5,850 yuan, "Golden Rat" brand at 4,150 yuan, "White Gold Cage" brand at 4,100 yuan, and "Yellow Gold Cage" brand at 3,200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Prices of Daily Necessities Slightly Stabilized</h3>
<p>Due to strict supervision by the authorities in recent days, the market for daily necessities saw weak sentiment and slow trading. Price increases were slightly curbed, and prices remained firm but difficult to lower. For example, "Gu Ben" soap remained at 790 yuan, "Bai Xiang Mao" soap at 715 yuan, "Scissors" soap at 760 yuan, "Huang Xiang Mao" soap at 670 yuan, "Phoenix" matches at 4,050 yuan, "Beautiful" brand at 4,200 yuan, "Golden Tripod" brand at 3,350 yuan, generic brands at 2,200 yuan, "Price's" candles at 550 yuan, "Monk" brand at 480 yuan, and generic brands at 340 yuan.</p>
<h3>Plain White Iron Rising Steadily</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for 36-inch and 37-inch plain white iron was active, with most transactions being small orders from local workshops. Business from out-of-town customers remained slow. However, due to low inventory in Shanghai, small-scale transactions were still manageable. Wholesale trading, on the other hand, faced a shortage of supply. Market sentiment was bullish due to the scarcity of spot goods, and prices rose steadily. Currently, 36-inch patterned sheets are selling for 220 yuan each, and 37-inch sheets for 270 yuan each, with a price of 44,000 yuan per ton. Black iron sheets are priced at 30,000 yuan per ton, and "Tou Zi" goods at 28,000 yuan per ton. Prices for patterned items are slightly higher.</p>
<h3>Lively Search for Black Iron Billets</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for 2,000-pound black iron billets continued its robust trend from the previous day. With the Lunar New Year approaching, canneries, thermos bottle factories, and tin printing plants were eager to stock up to avoid higher prices after the holiday. Consequently, the search for billets was particularly active. Unfortunately, the market had been facing a shortage of inventory for some time. After a prolonged buying spree, the supply of circulating goods became even more inadequate. Thus, the attempt to acquire large quantities of spot goods at once became extremely difficult. At the same time, those holding small quantities of spot goods naturally adopted an aggressive stance. According to inquiries, prices had already reached 20,000 yuan per ton by the 15th of this month. Very few deals were being made below the 20,000 yuan mark because holders were unwilling to sell easily. It is said that each case of 200-pound US "Mei Hui Si" tinplate was now worth 3,000 yuan. Supplies of single-coated and double-coated tinplate were already running low, according to records.</p>

<h3>Selected Poems in Response</h3>
<p>— Jun Shuo</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Changchun recently compiled a collection of poems in response, totaling nine hundred and sixty-four poems. These are all meticulous works by friends from foreign countries, recorded by Mr. Wang during his travels abroad. Yesterday, I visited him at the Astor House Hotel, and I was honored to be received and instructed in everything, which was extremely inspiring. From discussing poetry, we touched upon issues of life, and I gained much enlightenment. I hereby record the main points as follows:</p>
<p>Japan began to pay attention to the study of Chinese poetry during the reign of Emperor Kobun, approximately 1,270 years ago, which coincided with the third year of Emperor Gaozong's Xianheng era in the Tang Dynasty of China. During this period, poets emerged in large numbers, and fine works flourished like a forest. Emperor Kobun once wrote a poem for a banquet: "The Emperor's brilliance illuminates the sun and moon, the imperial virtue carries the heaven and earth, the three talents are harmonious and prosperous, and all nations express their loyalty." This is indeed the beginning of poems in response. Poems in response follow the style of Tao Yuanming in China and contain much of the principle of unifying knowledge and action. In particular, they greatly admire Wen Tianxiang's "Song of Righteousness," which is admired by both the court and the public.</p>
<p>Some poetry collections in China have long been lost and cannot be found in our country. However, in Japanese libraries, they are preciously preserved and can be consulted. The meticulous collection and emphasis on scholarship by the Japanese are truly admirable. For example, the "Complete Poetry of the Five Dynasties" in ninety volumes compiled by Li Diaoyuan of the Qing Dynasty, the "Selected Poems of the Yuan Dynasty" in one hundred and ten volumes compiled by Gu Sili, the "Complete Poetry of the Jin Dynasty" in fifty volumes compiled by imperial order in the fiftieth year of Kangxi, and the "Complete Tang Poetry" compiled in the forty-second year of Kangxi, which contains 48,900 poems by 2,200 authors, are all magnificent works. However, in our country, it is difficult to find them, which is a great pity.</p>
<p>Poems in response have a unique style, ancient, simple, and elegant, which is not often seen. According to the report, the main significance of the selected collection of the book is twofold. First, it is more difficult for the Japanese to study Chinese poetry than for the Chinese, but they do not stop their research because of the difficulty. Instead, they redouble their efforts to overcome the difficulty, so they can have profound attainments and rich harvests, which is not accidental. Only those who work hard in the world can achieve success, which is worthy of our model. Second, poems in response follow Tao Qian, which has a great influence on thought. Everything emphasizes the unity of knowledge and action and does not hesitate to make personal sacrifices. This is the unique personality of the Japanese, that is, the so-called Yamato spirit; if the Yamato spirit is translated into Chinese meaning, it is the word "righteousness," which is the treasure of the nation. Therefore, when the Greater East Asia War broke out, the Japanese were able to defeat the many with the few and the weak with the strong. This is all due to the great effect of this kind of spirit. This kind of spirit is by no means the work of a day or two, but has been cultivated for thousands of years. It is transmitted through books and is active between the lines.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang also selected a book of one hundred poems in response, which are also many fine works, published in Japan, and its purpose is very deep and admirable. Because the tips are precious and alert, I have recorded them after returning, and there may be errors, which I will be responsible for and declare here.</p>
<h3>Fourth Place in Essay Contest - My Plans for This Year</h3>
<p>— Song Pengcheng</p>
<p>The years pass by, and the thirty-first year has bid farewell to us. The one in charge of the thirty-second year has begun to perform his duties. As the sunlight of the new year shines on the earth and all things are thriving, I remember the past and feel infinite emotion. The past time has finally passed, and the future journey is waiting for me to step on one deep footprint after another. Standing on the boundary between the new and the old, I must first make a comprehensive calculation of this year's planned plan so that the three hundred and sixty days will not be spent in vain and add another page of regretful memories to the history of life.</p>
<p>A: Plans regarding my responsibilities</p>
<p>(1) Plan for the unification of deaf-mute groups in Shanghai</p>
<p>There are currently about 1,000 deaf-mute people living in Shanghai, but there are as many as ten deaf-mute groups. Among them, there are many who are truly striving for the welfare of the deaf-mute, but a few unscrupulous elements use their own defects and the sympathy of all walks of life for the deaf-mute to falsely form groups and raise donations in the name of filling their own pockets. They are unscrupulous and disgusting. I intend to unite the groups that truly work for the welfare of the deaf-mute, turning small units into large units. On the one hand, I will inform all walks of life of the truth, and on the other hand, I will severely warn unscrupulous elements, so that the Shanghai dumb movement can be brought into line.</p>
<p>(2) Plan for the unification of deaf-mute schools in Shanghai</p>
<p>There are currently seven deaf-mute schools in Shanghai (Zhonghua, Shanghai, Ya Qing, Guang Zhen, Fu Ya, Notre Dame, Zhongshan). There are a total of more than 200 deaf-mute students in school. If more than 200 people are allocated to seven schools, each school averages only about 30 people. Moreover, deaf-mute education is different from ordinary education, and each subject must be borne by experts. Because the education of deaf-mutes in our country has not yet broken away from its infancy, where can so many specialized talents come from? Even if there are so many specialized talents available for use by various schools, the economic strength of each school is also insufficient. It is planned to reorganize the above seven schools into a unified deaf-mute school, so that teachers can be concentrated, funds can be abundant, and school buildings can no longer be pigeonhole-style. This plan has not yet been realized since last year. This year, no matter what, I must make it successful within the possible scope.</p>
<p>(3) Plan to establish deaf-mute schools in other places</p>
<p>In order to seek the popularization of deaf-mute education, it is imperative to establish deaf-mute schools in major cities, so that the scattered disabled and deaf-mute children in various places have the opportunity to receive education. In the autumn of last year, I went to Jiaxing to establish a Yanhuh Deaf-mute School affiliated to the China Deaf-mute Association, and the results are still good. If the funds of the Deaf-mute Association are available this year, or if my personal economy is slightly wider, I plan to run deaf-mute schools in Suzhou or Hangzhou.</p>
<p>(4) Plan to restore deaf-mute publications.</p>
<p>Before the 28th year of the Republic of China, the intellectual education group of the Shanghai China Deaf-mute Association Headquarters once published a pure deaf-mute nature "Dark Translation" monthly magazine, which was the only deaf-mute newspaper in our country. Unfortunately, it was announced that it would cease publication in the spring of the 29th year due to various financial and personnel relations. The cause of deaf-mute is still in its infancy and urgently needs this kind of pure deaf-mute publication for publicity purposes, so that people from all walks of life can understand that deaf-mutes are not completely rotten wood that cannot be carved, and eliminate contemptuous thoughts. This publication is also used as an emotional connection for deaf-mutes in various places. Although there are some difficulties in resumption of publication, I intend to find a way to solve it.</p>
<p>(B) Plans regarding personal aspects</p>
<p>I am lazy by nature and never take my personal life seriously, which has caused great damage to my health, affecting my mental depression and lack of persistence in doing things. This is really not the way that our young people should be. At the beginning of the new year, I am determined to strive for a normal life and avoid unnecessary troubles caused by career, family, love, and other aspects. The Western proverb "No sound mind without a sound body" says that enriching the spirit is the most important factor in promoting the success of one's career, and I encourage myself deeply.</p>
<p>The Creator has given me the defects of mouth and ears, unable to speak or hear. In this vast world, I am simply so small that I cannot be seen at all. However, I think that things have no nests, and bamboo chips and wood scraps are all useful. In this great era of turmoil, young people bear a heavy responsibility. Although my strength is weak, if I can stick to my post and do things in a down-to-earth manner, and gather small streams into big rivers, I will be able to contribute to the country and society.</p>
<p>(Note: Song Pengcheng is 22 years old, graduated from Shanghai Deaf-mute School, and is currently the cadre of the Intellectual Education Group of the China Deaf-mute Association, etc.)</p>
<h3>Reading "The Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars" (2)</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>——To my daughter</p>
<p>The ancient emperors or wealthy people made great contributions to the people. Pangu created the world, Nuwa patched up the sky, Fuxi drew the eight trigrams, built kitchens, Shennong taught farming, and Xuanyuan made clothes and characters. Tang Wu snatched other people's land, which doesn't seem to be a good thing, but it is also remarkable to "console the people and punish the guilty." Among them, only Yao and Shun have nothing to say. Therefore, Yao ruled by doing nothing and achieved great success; Shun was a filial son and had good character. King Wen "served Yin with two-thirds of the world," which can be said to be loyalty, but loyalty is somewhat contradictory to his master's "consoling the people and punishing the guilty," so some virtues must be added, and this is where filial piety comes in. Creating the world and patching up the sky are completely myths and should not be discussed. Other things were probably invented gradually. People who have read books such as the history of social evolution should be able to understand that it is said that the emperors invented them. On the one hand, it is due to the ignorance of the ancients, who did not know where those things came from, and made up nonsense to explain them; on the other hand, it should be a kind of big deception; all emperors have made great contributions to the people, so the people should not oppose him. Later emperors, although they themselves seem to have no achievements, but their ancestors have had encounters and cannot be easily opposed. The words of the Han Gaozu era are more difficult to say. People are gradually less easily deceived, and more and more people are writing books and making theories. Many things have been clarified, and new things cannot be invented immediately if you want to. After he had been emperor for a few years, his father still had to kneel at the door to meet him, which seems to have little to do with filial piety. So here comes a new deception: he is a dragon seed, and his mother slept with a dragon; and his nose is big. How can people ask their mothers to sleep with a dragon? Even if they can, when they should be sleeping, they have not yet been born and cannot urge them. As for the nose, there are few ways to make it bigger, just like Cyrano de Bergerac cannot make his nose smaller. Then, the emperor can only let Liu Bang be, and we short-nosed people should not have unrealistic fantasies. Filial piety is the same. Do you want to be an emperor? Unless you talk about filial piety like Shun and King Wen. People without parents are not qualified in the first place, and if those who are qualified really do their best to be filial like them, filial piety will wear down their ambitions, and they will not have the slightest ambition to be emperors.</p>
<h3>Model Teacher for All Generations</h3>
<p>— Written by James Hiltmo, Translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>(10)</p>
<p>Then there were those ten years of mad Edward's reign, like an electric light, shining all the brighter before it burned out.</p>
<p>Strikes and shutdowns, champagne dinners and the unemployed marching, Chinese labor, tariff reform, the HMS Dreadnought, Irish autonomy, Dr. Crippen, the women's suffrage movement, the Chatalja line.</p>
<p>One April evening, wind and rain explaining Virgil's works to the fourth class, not very thoughtful because the papers h were full of exciting news: especially young Grayson was not listening, he was lost in thought. A quiet and nervous boy.</p>
<p>"Grayson, after class—ahem—wait a moment." Then:—</p>
<p>"Grayson, I don't want to be—ahem—very strict because you're—ahem—still doing well in your homework, but today—you seem—ahem—not at all mindful. Is there something important going on?"</p>
<p>"N—no, sir."</p>
<p>"Good—ahem—we won't talk about this anymore, but—ahem—next time I always hope to be better."</p>
<p>The next morning, the whole school was buzzing with the news that Grayson's father was on the Tltamic, and there was still no news about his fate.</p>
<p>Grayson was excused from his homework; all day, the whole school's thoughts were focused on his worries. Then the news came that his father was among those who were saved. Gipps shook hands with the boy. "Well, ahem—I'm so glad, Grayson. A happy ending. You must feel that life is still lovely after all."</p>
<p>"Y—yes: sir."</p>
<p>A quiet and nervous boy. This was the elder Grayson, not the younger Grayson, whom Gipps would later have to condole. (24) Social Services</p>
<h3>Our Newspaper Launches Medical Aid Fund for Elementary School Teachers</h3>
<p>Our reporter previously spoke with Mr. Pan Zhijie and Mr. Wang Yijing, those in charge of Tongren Hospital, about the lives of elementary school teachers in Shanghai. Their lives are extremely difficult. They diligently teach children to become outstanding members of society in the future. Their mission is greater than that of ordinary occupations, but their treatment is lower than that of ordinary occupations. At this time of high prices, it is difficult to eat well, let alone have nutrition. Therefore, the opportunity for disease to strike is easy. If they get sick, the medical expenses are impossible to raise, and the pain of groaning in bed is not difficult to imagine. Our newspaper has great sympathy for this and plans to raise a whole sum of money to set up a medical aid fund for elementary school teachers, and specially invite hospitals that are enthusiastic about public welfare to reduce the cost of medical expenses to the minimum or free of charge for teachers who hold proof documents to go to the hospital for medical treatment. It is not a relief attitude of mercy, but an assistance based on the spirit of mutual assistance to show respect. However, how should the specific measures be stipulated? There is a need for collective wisdom and joint discussion to make everything reasonable. Therefore, our newspaper invited Mr. Ding Fubao, Mr. Wang Peisun (represented by Xu Yong), Mr. Wang Yijing, Mr. Zhu Boquan (represented by Wu Xiaofen), Mr. Shen Siliang, Mr. Shen Tongyi, Mr. Zhang Yipeng, Mr. Xu Guanqun, Mr. Xiang Kangyuan, Mr. Wen Lanting (represented by Lei Kenan), Mr. Pan Da (represented by Wang Yijing), and Mr. Lu Yi (represented by Huang Jingwan), and five reporters from our newspaper to exchange opinions. It was decided to organize a medical aid fund committee for elementary school teachers, and the gentlemen who attended were listed as initiators. The Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association is also willing to participate. Mr. Zhang Yipeng, Mr. Ding Fubao, and Mr. Wang Yijing were elected to preside over the matter, and Mr. Zhang Yipeng was invited to bring it to fruition. The initial funding target is 200,000 yuan in national currency, with a trial period of six months. If the results are good, the project will be promoted and continued. At the meeting, Mr. Xu Guanqun generously agreed to donate 10,000 yuan of medicines from the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory. All the staff of our newspaper will save 5,000 yuan of Spring Festival banquet fees and donate all of them to promote the project. We sincerely hope that sympathetic people in the society will donate funds to complete it as soon as possible; on the one hand, we will first specially invite five public hospitals to be divided into five districts in the east, south, west, north, and center to handle outpatient and emergency cases. Mr. Wang Yijing is requested to contact the specially invited hospitals. As for the investigation procedures for elementary school teachers, our newspaper's social service department will actively handle them. If readers have any insights on this issue, we sincerely hope to get guidance at any time so that we can complete it satisfactorily.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association Entrusts Cold Clothes in the Snow</h3>
<p>(Letter) Because the weather is cold and freezing, and the roads are covered with rain and snow, it is very pitiful that the poor and disaster victims have no clothes to keep warm. Therefore, our association has specially sent Mr. Chen Shijin, an employee of our association, to send 200 sets of cotton clothes coupons, a total of 400 tickets (100 sets for adults and 100 sets for children). Please send them on behalf of your newspaper. The merits are immeasurable. (Editor's note: We will distribute them properly. All hidden poor and orphans in our city can come to the hall to apply. After investigation, we will issue them immediately.)</p>
<h3>Medical Fees for Poverty Alleviation</h3>
<p>In order to reduce the burden on patients and in response to our newspaper's poverty alleviation campaign, dentist Li Feixiang specially sent a letter to our newspaper yesterday, stating that he is willing to use the income from his medical fees from now until February 15 as our newspaper's poverty alleviation fund. Dr. Li's medical examples: tooth extraction (including injection fee) is 3 yuan, tooth filling is 10 yuan, teeth cleaning is 5 yuan, and examination is free. Gold teeth are only charged at cost.</p>
<h3>Report on Poverty Alleviation Funds</h3>
<p>(1) Li Chengxing Ji Wu Shaowu 1,000 yuan</p>
<p>(2) Ying Hengqing 500 yuan</p>
<p>(3) Wu Qihua 100 yuan</p>
<p>(4) Yue Shi 62.5 yuan</p>
<p>(5) Yuan Yiming 60 yuan</p>
<p>Total received today: 1,722.5 yuan</p>
<p>Previous balance: 16,343 yuan</p>
<p>Final balance: 18,065.5 yuan</p>
<h3>Registration for Yingshe Scholarship</h3>
<p>The Yingshe Scholarship has been established for many years, and the expenses for each session are borne solely by Mr. Yao Yizhang. The registration period for the current scholarship of the company for secondary and primary school students is from January 28 to February 8. Letters will be collected by Liu Zhengchao at No. 4 Yuqing Lane, Baligqiao Street.</p>
<h3>Mosque Association Establishes Scholarship</h3>
<p>The Islamic Association previously raised funds to establish a scholarship fund and has been running it for several years. It is estimated that dozens of students from elementary, middle, and high schools have received assistance this semester. The number of recipients will be increased next semester. Students of all levels who have excellent grades but cannot afford to continue their studies can apply every morning during this month at No. 222 Qinglian Street, Nanshi.</p>
