<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">日本貫澈對華新政策之途徑 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>本月十六日日本第八十二屆臨時議會席上，東條首　曾發表演說，闡述日本對於大東亞共榮圈內各國家各民族所採取新施策之眞意。其中値得我們特別注意的。有下列數言</p>
<p>「……目前縱觀大東亞之動向，各國家民族，對於日　之信賴，及對於完遂人東亞戰爭自動所作之眞摯協助，正在日益增强中。日本不動之方針，在使大東亞全域，自英美之桎下，　得永遠解放，……大東亞十　民族，已了解日本眞意，共同確信大東亞戰爭如未能完遂，則東亞無從獲得解放，新秩仔無從建設，東亞民族卽無幸福可言。……」</p>
<p>「中國百年來受英美侵略，備嘗塗炭之苦，但今已掙晚其覊絆，力求自强……中國民衆多年來之宿願及共理想，業已實現。……除對中國此種興隆衷心祝賀外，並決定今後加倍予以支援，並擬對中日兩國所訂立之條約，從根本上予以改訂，俾兩國協力關係，更趨緊密」。</p>
<p>又日本重光外相十七日在衆院預算總會席上，曾闡明日本外交政策。</p>
<p>其要旨謂：</p>
<p>「對於大東亞地域各國或予以完全獨立，或許其廣汎的參與政治，以達成其希冀。在相互平等互惠上，樹立善鄰之協力關係。……所謂使大東亞地域之民族國家，實現其多年期待，以平等互惠立塲相互協力者，前巳於對華新政策中逐漸見諸實現，此即爲重新開拓中日新關係樹立中日兩國之善鄰關係也。……英美荷等國之東洋政策，乃分割統治政策，以言英國，則英國之對印政策乃在離閒彼等以治之。……其於東亞，則爲離間中日而使之互相鬥爭，蓋其不欲東亞有一强大之國家存在。……又彼等於經濟方面所採之政策，則爲佔領殖民地後將其封鎖而獨佔其利益，此與日本所倡之解放資源互惠平等之方針又根本不同。」</p>
<p>昨日本市上海工商聯誼會會員大會席上，日本駐華公使田尻氏發表演詞要旨謂：</p>
<p>（一）重光外相在日本第八十二屆臨時議會中報吿外交政策中，會提出「平等互惠」。過去英美也曾以此爲外交口號。可是，究其實際，則英美所謂兩國「互惠」者，其出發點純從一國之利益着想。但現在東亞共榮圈內各國的「平等互惠」與此完全不同，是在共同目標之下，各以所餘力量悉數貢獻，以建設東亞新秩序。</p>
<p>（二）大東亞共榮圈，有似一大家庭，家長家屬，各有所司，各有職責，集體努力，以求整個家庭安定，才能得整個家庭幸福。從前東亞各國間因受英美侵略挑撥，所以未能相親相睦，現在英美勢力業已逐出，今後當無不睦因素存在。</p>
<p>（三）上海商塲過去深受英美商人利已主義薰染已深，祗圖一己厚利，罔顧公衆利益。今後極願東亞共榮圈內經濟界尤其上海經濟界諸君的經營目標，澈底變革英美商人的利已主義，個人利益固須顧到，但公衆利益更須顧到。</p>
<p>東條首相的演詞，是代表友邦日本整個國策的；重光外相的表示，是代表日本外交政策的；而昨天田尻公使的演詞是申引東條首相與重光外相演詞的意義的。我們所以特爲摘要複引者，可以從而確知大東亞戰爭以後，日本的國策是一貫的，且是遂漸使之具體化。我們願再申論如次：</p>
<p>（一）中國人民三數年來，尤其是最近一年半來，切望友邦日本國策之明期宣示，以及對華政策之轉變，在日本國策未明期宣示以及對華政策未轉變以前，中國人民對於日本之消極與不理會態度，極爲自然的事。迨本年初日本實施對華新政策，以及自東條首相以下各負責長官不時發表關於國策之明朗宣示，一貫方針。同時逐步使政策具體實踐，如交還租界，撤廢治外法權，發還敵產，移交統制權等等。在這種事實發展之下中國人民，向之抱消極與不理會態度者，已開始認識而考盧其積極與理會態度，也是極自然的事。這次，東條首相演詞中，「對於中日兩國所訂立之條約★從根本上予以改訂，俾兩國協力關係，更趨緊密」。我們翹首以待其早日以事實表現，那末我們敢斷言，時人所論一騎牆主義」者，將從此不復存在了。</p>
<p>（二）就目前事實而言，日本欲貫澈對華新政策，首先必須努力促使中國完成全面和平。然後才可以集合中國四億五千萬人民而共同協力。完成全面和平之道：第一，須强化國民政府。凡足以削弱或障礙國民政府强化者，均須加以改善，而尤須友邦日本從自身檢討。第二，强化國民政府，同時必須加强中國人民的力量。凡是獲得人民擁護的政府，同時也必然是人民與政府打成一片而發生力量，這才是眞正的協力加强。第三，如果國民政府因得日本協力而政治修明了，取得和平區內人民赤心誠意的擁護，那末，我們可以預言重慶統治下的民心也將很迅速的一致歸向的。</p>
<p>（三）田尻公使說：東亞有似一大家庭，那末，中日兩國，無疑是弟和兄了。就目前事實而言，日本强盛，中國貧弱，我們當然尊日本爲兄，而自居弱弟。今天的弱弟，固然應該虛心學習兄長的長處，如政治的修明，敎育的普及，科學的發達，以至於體格的健全，以期發育長成了，也可以分擔兄長的責任。但是弱弟的心理，爲兄者應在友愛情緒下瞭解之，原諒之，才不　吵架，家庭間才能眞正相親相睦，幸福無疆。</p>

<h3 id="c3">松井石根大將在粵　參觀綏署模範營　抵香港後並發表談話 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>廣州廿一日中央社電日松井石根大將自於十八日乘機蒞粵後，於十九日上午十一時蒞綏靖公署模範營參觀。陪同前往者，有連絡部長。綏署參謀長等。當到達時，該營營長陳勳率所屬員兵列隊歡迎，旋引導參觀營內一切設施，至十二時始離營。</p>
<p>香港廿一中央社電　日松井石根顧問，此次赴南方觀察，於廿日抵香港，廿一日會見中國記者餓，發表來港感想，大意謂，余此次來港已爲第六次，首次尙在中國革命之前。又民國十一年來此時，會轉赴廣州訪晤胡漢民·李宗仁·白崇禧等，就孫總　倡導之大亞洲主義及中日提携問題等，交換彼此意見。當時香港報紙有指予所抱之大亞洲主義，爲侵略中國之假面具者。終因一部中國人士誤解此意，致不幸引起此次中日事變。但現今中國人士已明瞭日本之大亞洲主義，並非爲侵略中國之帝國主義思想。關於最近日本對中國之新政策，係始終一貫，其目的在實現兩國之眞正提携合作。在中日事變之初，會在上海作戰，但其目的並不在打中國人，而欲剷除英美之惡勢力，蓋因英美之惡勢力存在，故使中日兩國干戈相見。日本現已着手交還租界及撤廢冶外法權，故中國人士應有新的認識，而發揮東亞人之眞面目云。</p>

<p>漢口二十一日中央社電　日柴山兼四郎部隊長於民國二十八年至二十九年任漢口特務部長，對於戰後武漢之復興貢獻甚鉅。柴山氏於日昨再度來漢。昨日上午視察陸軍事二十九師並加檢閱，對於該師之與友軍並肩作戰，獲致戰果，表示感謝。下午五時於怡和村省府接見記者，發表感想。柴山氏首稱，余已三年不來漢口，今日相較，武漢一切，均有進步，令人感奮。漢口之酷暑天氣，此爲余印象最深者。昨日曾視中國國軍，關於其他，恕尙不能奉告。其次，關於中國國軍之進展，柴山氏述其感想稱，武漢方面之國軍，無論在素質上，及訓練上，均有猛晋，現已可與日本軍相互協力，在確保交通綫，維持治安，以及討伐戰等，均已獲有相當成績，此爲中國各級幹部努力之結果。其他政治經濟方面，較之當時之內容，更爲整備。即以中江實業銀行而言，余聞悉其現狀，極爲欣慰。省市政新之政績，因省長市長努力，逐漸良好。今日曾參觀漢陸軍第廿八帥部隊，並于烈日之下對彼等訓話，約四十分鐘，彼等立正之姿勢，始終不動，可見向日訓練有素，軍隊之良否，在于指揮官之如何，長江下遊地區雖不乏優良軍隊，然在一般觀之，本地軍隊則較下游地區爲優。然中國軍隊欲達到眞正優良之　的，在編成配備及給與上尙有改良之必要，余返家後，將努力研究，　造優良之軍隊。余久未來漢，頗　懸念，故不避暑日而來漢。柴山氏繼又對最近渝軍將領參加和運激增之事回答記者　問謂，一月九日之新方針，已滲透在前綫不絕受日軍强壓之「渝軍」重慶今已失抗戰精神之根據，國府之政治已納入軌道，於茲愈需要日方之協力，渝方乃極力掩飾眞事態，但其窘狀昭然。此時國府政治已吿確立，國軍取日軍之地位以代之，而獨立維持治安，驅逐共產軍，方能實現參戰之意義，而使治安確立，物資豐富，生產力增强，作爲大東亞戰爭之兵站基地。同時最近物價高漲，輸送及半產之阻碍，爲一大原因，若治安獨立，即可解決。國軍若能早日代替日軍維持治安，則可使日軍能以全力擊滅英美，實現中日同心一體同生共死之精神。</p>

<p>東京二十一日中央社電　此間朝日新聞本日社論以「中日團結之新階段」爲題，論述如次：東條首相於第八十二屆臨時議會作施政演說，曾闡明決將中日間所訂立之條約，加以根本改訂，進而謀達成兩國之協力體制，此點殊堪注目。至於改訂之內容。自非吾人揣測可及，惟日方曾不惜以全副精神協助中國，使完成自主獨立，乃昭著之事實。其次，幷以中國民衆爲對手，實現和衷共濟之熱意，日本對中國期待之殷，由此可見。故中國民衆均應澈底瞭解，不完遂大東亞戰爭，則大東亞無由解放，不從事大東亞之建設，則大東亞永無福社。大東亞共榮圈之建設，必由大東亞十億民衆本諸善鄰與協力之精神，團結以赴，然其必備之絕對條件，即爲東亞軸心之中日兩國相互澈底理解，以赤誠協力，所謂中日不能完全融和團結，則大東亞戰爭不能圓滿結束，實非過言。本年一月與中國參戰同時實施之日本對華新政策，得使中國脫離百年來之桎梏，一舉達成中國國民革命目標中廢除不平等條約及爭取獨立自由之目的，由此可知日本之眞意，非企圖滅亡中國，實爲欲完成中國之獨立與國運昌隆。至目前之重慶政權，今從事抗日，對此事實亦不得不有所認識，因此日本之新政策，予重慶方面之影響實至深且鉅，其陳營內部之動搖形勢已無法掩飾。蓋日本對華政策，於解決事變途上已有莫大之功效，但尚未能使抗日政權即日趨於崩潰。如由解決事變之眞義而言，即使抗日政權業已崩潰，如中國全體民衆並不欲參加與日本融洽合作一致協力時，則今後之目的，仍不得謂爲已經達成。爲今之計，展望中國政府使民衆更徹底理解日本之誠意，根本破除抗日之憑念，爲實現中日之合作，作更進一步之努力，吾信將來中日條約之改訂，必將以展開實現中日兩國和衷共濟之新途徑爲目標，而早日見諸實施也。</p>

<p>日水人要理解中國最好的方法，先應該把自己　在中國、的立塲來觀察一切，換句話說，假僅自己是中國人，在那種塲合，作徇感想呢？某種地方，在日本人視爲常然是應該不快的，但中國人倒不會生氣。如其日本人這樣看法，以爲中國人是像日本人．一樣不侖生氣的人種，那就大爲錯誤了。中國人不他不會生氣的，而目現在正生氣着。他們因爲如道如其不加考慮地生起氣來，則束縛自身的災難就快要降臨了，所以他們的生氣不現於形式。從中國人的外表判斷起來，中國人和日本人不同，因此就以爲中國人是泰物。日本人是人，中國人也是人，熱的東西同樣學得熱，冷的東西同樣覺得冷。連這樣簡單道理都不知道的蠢物是沒有的。但這一旦成爲民族與民族間的問題，則人們有時也會學成這樣蠢物的。試舉一例來加以說明：</p>
<p>日本人同志要是吵起來，不像中國人同志那樣僅作口頭上的爭吵，他立刻就要動手毆打對方，而且日本人同志因吵架而被毆，並不當作了不得的侮辱。然而日本人要是在日本國內被中國人打了，那磨日本人抱那種感想呢？想到進一點，日本人在中國就不能毆打中國人了。而且中國方面對於被毆這件事，認爲是奇恥大辱。這和日本入被對方在臉上吐了一口痰一樣的引爲是侮辱，要是日本人被中國人在雎上吐了一口痰，這個日本人作何感想呢？恐怕那對手的中國人，不久就侖被送到醫院裏去吧才</p>
<p>我有一個朋友，在某工廠做監督的，因爲有個華　職上懶惰，不能像他理想般的工作，爲了警戒他起見，就板起面孔，這樣一來，那中國人明天起就不到工廠工作，辭掉了公司的生意，不但如比，連那懶惰職工的朋友們，也一齊不到公司裏來了。我就　：「中國人被對方毆辱，和日本人被對方在臉上吐了一口痰有同樣的感覺」。自此以後，我那朋夜再也不毆中國人了，我的朋友，他把自己站在中國人的立塲來想，所以開始覺悟了一己行動的重大性。</p>
<p>我的朋友所毆打的不過是一個工人，假使對方是上海的」冬流」之一，那麼將引起怎樣的結果呢？大家知道在上海有所謂「名流」者，乃爲上海市民所尊醫之目標的老前輩，例如：聞蘭亭，張一矚，袁履登，林庚侯先生等德高望重的人們。上海人對這些老前鞏用「老爸爸」的愛稱來敬重而親愛他們。在上海政治狀態混亂的時代，這些老的輩的地位自然成爲一個政治的中心，要想在上海作社會活動的時候，人們先須聽從這些老前訪的意見，依其意見而決定自己的態度。因少，這些名流的社會的地位，在日本相等於大將，大臣。而上海社會所以對這些老前輩道緩尊敬，並不因其地位而生，乃因其人格的感召所致，所以其地位頗爲强問。假使現在這些老紳土被日本人毆辱，則上海市民就感到似乎是自身受到侮辱。日本人的大臣大將，若被中國人唾一痰，則日本國民不會對此問題默然無言、勢必引起重大的國際問題。所以在主海日本人毆辱中國人往并會引起意料之外的重大後果。這樣觀察起來，當地的日本人，給成中國人的立塲來考察，則事情似根簡單，共實應該知道那在中日間上有重大的政治的影響。大部份日本人，如其有丫在中國人的立塲來老察－切的雅量，則中日問題將顯呈着與今日完全不同的狀態吧！業巳發表的細駐藥派遺軍司令官的「告日本兵士書」的精神，其結果就是告誡日本兵士應站在中國人的立傷來考察一切。我以爲這精神在僑華日人向令部澈底時，就是中日二大民族眞正結合的時候。（六月二十一日鵬翔合譯）</p>

<p>上海物資調查委員會，已正式成立，即日起開始工作。本市陳市長兼該會委員長，昨日曾暢談關於該會成立後施行任務方針及抱負如下：上海物資調查會，昨開第一次中日聯合會議，出席委員及議決事項，大致已見報載，各委員多在京專誠來蒞者，熱忱參與，殊感欣慰。其最要之點，即議定決置中日兩國調查官，並即日成立委員會及調查官之事務所，調查官不久當即開始辦公。此後無論市區及租界內外之任何國籍人民，所持有之物資，均將按照委員會所賦予之權限，隨時隨地，加以調查。自辦理登記，以至檢查公私倉庫，私人儲積，均由會指定關係各機關聯絡辦理，務期以最敏捷之方法，查獲物資。如此進行，囤積者自難隱匿。至於查獲物資，自當遵照政府法令辦理。查戰時物資，自應集中利用，一面應戰爭需要，一面安定民生。如商民私人均能深明大義，奉行國策，協力戰爭，只求合法之營業利潤，則政府於推行統制政策下，自可調劑供求，統籌應付，乃近年即以上海一隅而論，奸儈利用戰時機會，不此之圖，轉而囤積居奇，但求厚利，不顧公眾之利益，甚至危及國家之前途。在其箇人之觸犯典章，固不待言，但因此妨及戰時之需要，其罪實浮於圖利之上。政府旣鑒於囤積之主法，同時注意正當之供求，因之查辦囤積，前此派員澈查，具見報載，今更爲進一步正本清源之計，設立本會，聯合中日兩國委員，分工合作，澈底調查，務使奸儈無以容身，囤積無從隱匿。物資旣不在少數囤積者之手，得獲流通，則價格亦自可趨平，爲必然之理，此蓋本會設立之旨超，亦惟一任務之所在也。</p>

<p>聞蘭亭詞</p>
<p>首由聞蘭亭氏致詞，原詞如下：從二月二十五日本會召集會員大會到現在，已有四個月了。本來會務是應當積極進行的，但是因爲各會員公務很忙，同時因爲沒有覓得適當的會所。這次蒙友邦各機關的援助，尤其是海軍武官府熱誠相助，方得租賃了這所完備的會所，在此，我們全體會員應著重表示感謝的意思。上次會員大會除了歡迎新會員外，又歡迎田尻公使矢野總領事及大使館諸位先生。</p>
<p>記得當時田尻說過：「諸位在過去恐亦誤解日本在軍事上，領土上，以至經濟上有征服中國之野心，其實日本之意圖，並非征服中國，始終視中國如，欲使中國獨立，　重其自主主權。</p>
<p>「余在去年十一月來滬，目睹上海之經濟衰微，與內地之關係斷絕，深感驚異，故力謀早日復興上海之經濟，暢通內地之物資，中日工商人士之活動範圍旣廣，則物資移動之限制，當然予以緩和。</p>
<p>「但不容任何人因通商範圍廣泛，而作個人之囤貨，亦不容爲利益計，而爲任意之處理，關於此點，希望工商各界人士，自動籌得妥善之辦法，在目前時期，須力戒有皆戰爭目的之情事。」</p>
<p>在這四個月間。日本對華新政策，旣見逐步實現，如交還租界的具體化，商統會的組織，以及取締囤積等等，這些都是田尻公使努力的結果，我們極誠表示敬意與感謝。</p>
<p>今日的會員大會，非常欣幸的，是又蒙田尻公使岡中將曁諸位長官光臨，我們還要請求田尻公使致詞，給我們指導，再本會幹事梶山先生最近將轉任天津三井支店長，他過去對本會會務最爲努力，今天我們歡送他，並得特製銀杯以資紀念，並祝他前途發展無量。</p>
<p>公使演詞</p>
<p>繼由田尻公使發表演說，略謂：建設東亞共榮團的方針，在使東亞各國獲得解放，在東亞領域內的各國，不分大小不分強弱，均應互相合作，以期收獲最大的力量。譬如一加一等於二，原爲算術上之定則，依余觀之，在目前情勢之下，一個國家與一個國家協力，其力量不僅爲二，必須變成三，或四，五…所以建設東亞共榮團希望每個國家能互相協力，互不鬥爭，團結起來，以冀增加整個東亞的偉大力量。「」　　此次日本舉行臨時議會，　光外相。報告外交政策，曾提出「互惠平等」。過去英美也曾此爲外交口號，可是，究其實際，則英勢所謂「兩國互惠」者，其出發點純從一國之利益着想，但現在東亞共榮團內各國的「平等互惠」與此完全不同，是在一共同目標下，各以所餘力量，悉數貢獻，以建設東亞新秩序。</p>
<p>大東亞共榮團，有似一大家庭，家長家屬，各有所司，各有職責，集體努力，以求整個家庭安定，才能得到整個家庭幸福，從前東亞各國間因受英美侵略，挑撥勢力業已逐出，今後當無不睦因素存在。</p>
<p>日本對中國之希望，爲中國復興與建設成功。上海商塲過去深受英美商人利已主義薰染已深，祇圖一已厚利，岡顧公眾利益，今後極願東亞共榮團內經濟界尤其是上海經濟界諸君的經營目標，澈底變革英聞在商界商人的利已主義，個人利益固必贏利，但公眾利益更須顧到。</p>
<p>會務報告</p>
<p>最後由幹事　本，董道青報告會務：</p>
<p>（一）會務簡況　本會自去年九月成立以來，繼承各方贊助，會務日益進展，開創之初，原假香港路銀行公會三〇一號爲臨時辦事處，嗣經日方副理事長小室，幹事栗本，　山三民接洽結果，始於本年五月租定興亞大樓四樓四〇八號至四一一號及三號爲新會所。又本會原有會員乙百們。自本年二月起，依照第一次理事會決議，雙方各徵得新會員二十位，共計一百四十位。均爲本市工商及金融各界素負聲望者，俾得共謀會務之發展，誠可爲本會前途慶幸。</p>
<p>（二）經費　本會經費目前全賴會費支持，而會費收入有限，以後會務進展，開支則隨之增大。應即預籌辦法，茲分別報告如次：</p>
<p>一·收支情形：本會會費，每位每月爲五十元，在本年三月之前，原有會員乙百位，月入會費五千元。因開支簡書，勉可維持，稍有不敷，則以發起人所繳之創辦費二萬元彌補。新會所房租一項，須九千一百九十五元，其他水電房捐等等亦連帶增加，每月不敷約一萬元，經第二次理事會議決，先籌六個月，計六萬元。連新會所設備費十萬元，共計十六萬元。二·增收會費　本會以後開支增大，原定會費每位每月五十元，不敷應用，自本年十月份起，每月增乙百元，特提請大會追認。三·基金　本會爲發展會務，已由第二次理事會議決，擬籌基金中儲券一百萬元。由會員共同籌募，自由認捐請大會追認。四·新會所添置傢俱約十萬元，請大會追認。五·不久，擬設置簡單食堂，爲會員應用</p>
<p>報告畢，聞理事長代表致電梶山幹事銀杯，當由梶山幹事致謝詞，旋即茶點，攝影，並開映電影，直到七時許始行散會。</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3 id="c49">論華股集中交易 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>本市華商股票業商三十五家，自經奉頒執照恢復營業而後，爲切實採取自肅政策，籌謀集中交易起見，聞有暫時組織「華商股票業商聯誼會」的準備。這是組織正式股票公會，建立正式股票市塲的先聲，自未可等閒視之。</p>
<p>本年二月二十四日本欄即曾說過：「華商股票，在目前戰時經濟之要求，自有從速確立正式市塲之必要；企望當局根據當地環境，參酌各國成規，召集工商界有聲望的代表，共同討論正式股票市塲之建立，同時，責成其領導股票業商組織正式公會，遵照法令，從事於華股正當之經營，籍使工商事業得因正常之華股交易，而獲得資金之靈活，生產之發展。」</p>
<p>日前消息所傳，政府爲導引游資以入正當投資途徑，聞已准許證券交易所之復粉，而華商股票業商適於此時先爲「聯誼會」之組織，足徵華股集中交易，將爲必成的事實，而其意義則得說明如下：（一）集中交易可以掃除華股業商各自爲政的營業行爲，使華商股票市塲成爲公開市塲，無由包藏股票投機心理。（二）集中交易可以取得一切聯絡，使股票周轉靈活，股票市價得免於幕後的操縱，不至游移飄動，瞬息萬變。（三）集中交易而後，證券交易得循漸進方式，誘導游資進入民族資本的生產部門。此爲證券交易的基本目標，尤其是在今日的中國，——洋貨絕跡國貨抬頭的時會，——改進生產，增加產量與改良產品，實爲提高證券價值之唯一先決條件。</p>
<p>所以，華商股票的前途，當以生產事業的前途爲標準；若用任何其他尺度來看待華商股票，非但是太淺近與不合理，並且是不可爲訓的。</p>

<p>— 莎蕾</p>
<p>處常是容易的　然而應變却是不易！。</p>
<p>在常態的情况下，一切是有要理的，按步就班從容不迫，這樣的處理，應付。大錯的鑄成成份的因素是幾乎少得等於零。這不僅因爲有一定的規則可資遵循。有充分的時間可　思廣益，也因爲根本是風平浪靜的河面，即使一葉扁舟，即使駕駛的學識與經騐幼稚與欠缺　技術也生疏，但覆舟的悲劇是不憂發生的。雖然多費掉氣力向光陰。多經此周折，到達彼岸也不是難事。</p>
<p>可是世事是沒有永遠一帆風順的，所謂「變生肘腋，禍起簫墻」。這時若慌了手腳，亂了思想。鈍了口舌，像大海中突擊來了風暴，即懾於風威，又受脅於浪的顛簸，把不住舵槳，船身也自然失去了平衡，再加上不　當的應付，很可能的舵誤獎失，濁浪捲滅了一切。</p>
<p>應變是千鈞一髪的緊急關頭，第一先要保持鎮靜的態度，審察來勢的方向與程度，找尋牠的缺陷。這時學識與經騐磨成的頭腦與眼光，將發出機智與敏銳的光力　　　　　　　　　　將如勁風發揮出掃蕩的威力！</p>
<p>平庸與幹練在處常中才十分　　．　應變將是一塊試金石，人生的光耀如百煉之金，愈磨而愈燦爛。這將永遠昭示在人類史冊上的。</p>
<h3 id="c61">求學時代應該變愛嗎？ <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— 沈愛瑛</p>
<p>對於男女同校利弊問題的管見</p>
<p>五日本報社會評以「男女同校利弊問題的再檢討」爲題　討論男女同校的利弊，以爲「從理論騐證到事實」。男女同校制。不能「如推斷所盡利的結果」。而且相反地。「是有着弊過於利的事實」。是的，我們應該承認。現在　多中等學校中的不良情形。如侈言自由，放蕩游戲。妄談變愛，不務學業等，不過筆者認爲這並不是一個單純的教育問題。而是與家庭以及整個的社會有着密切的聯擊的。換言之，即是整個社會問題之一部而其補救辦法。也就非和社會其他他問題相聯擊在一起不可。</p>
<p>考男女同樣制的本身，原甚良好，我們不論從歷史的，社會政治的，教育的　先來看，俱有其存在的理由和價值，就筆者的淺見，所謂「妄談變愛」，並非絕對是男女同校制的結果，如其因爲有了男女同校制，而才發生「妄談愛愛」的話，那麼問題的解決，豈不輕而易舉；只要取消同校制，就完全　　了。但這樣的解決法仍舊是不澈底的，欲澈底補救此　流弊，至少要牽涉到下述的幾個問題：</p>
<p>（一）家庭教育問題，四諺有云：「母親是　人的搖籃」，那就是說，　人的基礎是建築在家族教育上的。反顧我國家許，一般家長對於子女在家族中的教育素不甚注意（自然也很有例外），尤　是在上海一般富裕的家庭，除了　少數的例外。簡直都不把家族教育放在心上；他們祇知對於子女的溺愛，以爲只要將自己的子女哺養長大，送進學校，就算是盡了責任了，這是多麼可怕的心理！所以，家長不欲子女長進則已，如欲使其長進，則非以自己爲　樣。而　底講究家庭教育不爲功。</p>
<p>（二）學校教育問題。教育原爲神聖事業。　　肩負着造就完整人的責　。然而目前上海教育事業之腐化，其嚴重性實數倍於「因男女同校」而發生的「妄談變愛」！他們假借教育作爲營利發財的工具，他們所注意的不是在造就完整的人，而是　營業如何才能發達，也因此而引起了「同行」間的互相傾軋。互相排擠等等醜態，在這樣的情形下，本來品行較差的學生，愈變愈壞　本來較好的也就同流合汚了。這是必須澈底改革的。</p>
<p>（三）是社會環境問題，正如該社評中　說的：「上海的社會形態　不必諱言的是奢靡放浪的陷阱」。這裏有官辦和私營的賭場。都張開了血盆似的大口，無壓地吞噬着人們的金錢甚至生命！這裏有低級趣味的，肉麻的電影；有變相的誘人的舞廳；有最昂貴的奢侈化妝品及裝飾有……品……有這樣　多的好去處，那麼「偕看電影，同上跳舞，私取家中錢物」，以及「愛好修飾，塗脂抹粉，行動異常」等事情，自然要層出不窮了。我們也當局。該以最大的決心，來澈底根絕賭博，改善影片的內容，糾正跳舞的愿意，限制甚至禁止化妝奢侈品之製造與出售。如此，社會中既無陷阱，青年亦無陷入之危險。既無陷入之危險，則皆後善如流，而無大弊　。</p>
<p>（四）是青年本身問題。　書時代之青年可以變愛嗎？筆者的答覆是肯定的。因爲變愛本來是青年　事　青年時代不談變愛，難道等到老年時代不成。不過我們談變愛不要「妄」談，即－先應該確定正確的變愛觀。變愛決不可單純的爲了慾　，爲了一時的情感衝動；真正的變愛，是建築在相互的工作上，相互才能的發　上，相互的常識的進求和努力上，以及對於社會事業的關心！否則，別就等於浮雲，一吹即散的。明白了這，那麼變愛並非是有壞處和無幫助，是顯而易見的了。只重情感，妄變變愛是等於自殺　互重理智，正確的變愛　是等於新生。在這樣的情形下，變愛的維持者不是金錢，不是看電影，不是上跳舞，不是化妝修飾，而是學識的進求，工作的熱誠，和才能的發展。自然，筆者並不反對娛樂，但娛樂應該正當，真正的娛樂是含有「再造」（Recreation）——恢復精神的意思的，在這樣的意義下，則音樂，踢球，繪畫，散步，……等都是敢好的方法；如其一定要找尋特別有刺激的事情，那決不是真正的娛樂。因此，有正確的變愛的人，決不會妨礙前途，恰恰相反，它正是創造前途的有力因素。</p>
<h3 id="c62">成功的必要條件 <a href="#c62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— 朱飛</p>
<p>一個人的成功，決定的條件雖然　多方面的，但是主要的只有一個：就是沒有「決心」。能不能　力大做！</p>
<p>聰明的大　，知識的指示。環境的誘導，和友朋的鼓勵，可以說都是促成一個人成功的條件。但是當事人　　並沒有「決心」。「勞力」去幹的話，任他怎樣誘導，怎樣鼓勵，或者有異人的天賦，高深的知識，也只等於零而已。流蕩而死。和沿門求乞的人中唱　決不能說他們沒有具備以上的條件。</p>
<p>相反的，並沒有天賦的聰明，也沒有能夠好好　　求過知識的人。倒有不少是成功的。劉玄德，朱元璋，不過是「　覆小兒」。「牧牛童子」而已，但是他們終　成功爲「　代政治領導者」「民族英雄」。其原因　是有「決心」。能「努力」。</p>
<p>總理革命能夠成功，也是決定在堅毅不移的「決心」。和百折不回能續不斷的努力上。這也是很明顯的事實。</p>
<p>八九年前，筆者有個親戚，小時固然是一個極頑皮而無賴的孩子，一直到二十歲　年，還是終日游蕩，不務正事，所以親戚里人都鄙视他。父母家人也憎恨他，誰都肯定的這樣說他：「沒出息的東西」。後來他忽的恍然覺悟了，一改以往的態度，變成一個很好的人，並且不久投考了當時的中央軍校，畢業以後，很快的　到團長以上的位置，這又是誰能料到的呢！</p>
<p>所以我們要達到理想的目的，成功一個不平凡的人，必定先下「決心」。然後以不屈不撓的精神去「努力」奮　，總有一天是會成功的。</p>
<h3 id="c63">嘗試 <a href="#c63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— 文中</p>
<p>「嘗試」可以說是理想用行動來　　的初步。假使你懷有美滿的理想而怯於嘗試。那理想終是理想，決不能成爲事實。因爲「嘗試」　成功之　的出發點。</p>
<p>由於「嘗試」。我們可以明瞭全體的趨勢獲得寶貴的教訓。</p>
<p>最宜注　的就是在嘗試某一件事之前必須經過一番理智　自信力的仔細考慮，眼光要放得遠大，澈底明瞭利害得失。否則冒昧地去嘗試，或許會演成「一失足成千古恨」的悲劇。因爲「嘗試」不單是成功的光榮的大道的出發　的同時也是失敗的隨落的歧途的出發點！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Ways Japan Is Implementing Its New Policy Towards China <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>On the 16th of this month, at the 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Japanese Diet, Prime Minister Tojo delivered a speech explaining the true intentions behind Japan's new policies towards all nations and peoples within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The following points are particularly noteworthy:</p>
<p>"...Currently, looking at the trends in Greater East Asia, the trust of various nations and peoples in Japan, and their sincere assistance in voluntarily completing the Greater East Asia War, are increasing day by day. Japan's unwavering policy is to ensure that the entire Greater East Asia region is permanently liberated from the shackles of Britain and the United States... The ten ethnic groups of Greater East Asia have understood Japan's true intentions and jointly believe that if the Greater East Asia War is not completed, East Asia cannot be liberated, a new order cannot be established, and the peoples of East Asia cannot have happiness..."</p>
<p>"China has suffered from British and American aggression for a century, experiencing immense suffering, but now it has broken free from its shackles and is striving for self-reliance... The long-cherished wishes and ideals of the Chinese people have already been realized... In addition to sincerely congratulating China on this prosperity, we have decided to increase our support and plan to fundamentally revise the treaties signed between China and Japan, so that the cooperative relationship between the two countries will become closer."</p>
<p>Furthermore, on the 17th, Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, at the plenary session of the House of Representatives Budget Committee, elucidated Japan's diplomatic policy.</p>
<p>Its main points are:</p>
<p>"To grant complete independence to the countries in the Greater East Asia region or to allow their broad participation in politics, in order to achieve their hopes. To establish cooperative relations of good neighborliness on the basis of mutual equality and benefit... The so-called realization of the long-awaited expectations of the national states in the Greater East Asia region, to cooperate with each other on an equal and mutually beneficial footing, has already been gradually realized in the new policy towards China, which is to re-explore the new relationship between China and Japan and establish good neighborly relations between the two countries... The Eastern policies of Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands are policies of division and rule. Taking Britain as an example, Britain's policy towards India is to separate them in order to govern them... In East Asia, it is to alienate China and Japan and make them fight each other, because they do not want a powerful country to exist in East Asia... Furthermore, their economic policies are to occupy colonies and then seal them off to monopolize their benefits, which is fundamentally different from Japan's advocated policy of liberating resources, mutual benefit, and equality."</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the general meeting of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association, Japanese Minister to China, Mr. Tajiri, delivered a speech, the main points of which are:</p>
<p>(1) In his report on diplomatic policy at the 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Japanese Diet, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu mentioned "equality and mutual benefit." In the past, Britain and the United States also used this as a diplomatic slogan. However, in reality, the so-called "mutual benefit" between Britain and the United States was purely based on the interests of one country. But now, the "equality and mutual benefit" of the countries within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is completely different. It is under a common goal, with each contributing all their remaining strength to build a new order in East Asia.</p>
<p>(2) The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is like a large family, with the head of the family and family members each having their own duties and responsibilities, working together to seek the stability of the entire family, so that the entire family can be happy. In the past, the countries of East Asia were unable to be close and harmonious because they were provoked by British and American aggression. Now that British and American forces have been driven out, there will be no more factors of discord in the future.</p>
<p>(3) The Shanghai business community in the past has been deeply influenced by the egoism of British and American merchants, only seeking their own huge profits and disregarding the public interest. In the future, it is hoped that the business circles within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, especially the economic circles of Shanghai, will thoroughly change the egoism of British and American merchants in their business goals. Personal interests must be taken into account, but the public interest must be taken into greater account.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo's speech represents the entire national policy of friendly Japan; Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's statement represents Japan's diplomatic policy; and Minister Tajiri's speech yesterday was an extension of the meaning of Prime Minister Tojo's and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's speeches. The reason why we specially extracted and repeated them is that we can thereby know for sure that Japan's national policy after the Greater East Asia War is consistent and is gradually being made concrete. We would like to further elaborate as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Chinese people for several years, especially in the last year and a half, have been eagerly awaiting a clear declaration of the national policy of friendly Japan and a change in its policy towards China. Before Japan's national policy was clearly declared and its policy towards China was not changed, the Chinese people's passive and indifferent attitude towards Japan was extremely natural. Since the beginning of this year, Japan has implemented a new policy towards China, and responsible officials from Prime Minister Tojo downwards have from time to time issued clear declarations on national policy and consistent guidelines. At the same time, policies are being gradually implemented in concrete terms, such as returning concessions, abolishing extraterritorial rights, returning enemy property, and transferring control rights. Under this development of facts, the Chinese people, who previously held a passive and indifferent attitude, have begun to recognize and consider a positive and attentive attitude, which is also extremely natural. In Prime Minister Tojo's speech this time, "The treaties signed between China and Japan will be fundamentally revised so that the cooperative relationship between the two countries will become closer." We look forward to its early manifestation in facts. Then we dare to assert that what people call a "two-sided" policy will no longer exist from now on.</p>
<p>(2) In terms of the current facts, if Japan wants to implement its new policy towards China, it must first strive to promote the completion of a comprehensive peace in China. Then it can gather the 450 million people of China and cooperate together. The way to complete a comprehensive peace: First, the National Government must be strengthened. Anything that weakens or hinders the strengthening of the National Government must be improved, and friendly Japan in particular must examine itself. Second, while strengthening the National Government, the strength of the Chinese people must also be strengthened. A government that gains the support of the people is also bound to be one where the people and the government are united and generate strength. This is the real strengthening of cooperation. Third, if the National Government, thanks to Japan's cooperation, has improved its politics and gained the sincere support of the people in the peace zone, then we can predict that the hearts of the people under the rule of Chongqing will also very quickly and consistently turn towards it.</p>
<p>(3) Minister Tajiri said: East Asia is like a large family. Then, China and Japan are undoubtedly younger and elder brothers. In terms of the current facts, Japan is strong and China is weak. We naturally respect Japan as the elder brother and regard ourselves as the weaker younger brother. The weak younger brother of today should of course humbly learn from the strengths of the elder brother, such as political clarity, the popularization of education, the development of science, and even physical health, in order to grow up and be able to share the responsibilities of the elder brother. However, the elder brother should understand and forgive the psychology of the weak younger brother with friendly emotions, so that there will be no quarrels, and the family can truly be close and harmonious, with boundless happiness.</p>

At 3:00 PM on the 21st, in the Imperial Palace, with His Majesty the Emperor present and Prime Minister Tojo standing by, a ceremony was held for Generals Nagano and Sugiyama (excluding General Terauchi) to be included in the Marshal's Office.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 4:00 PM on the 21st that His Majesty the Emperor of Japan, to commend Navy Admiral Nagano Osami, Army General Terauchi Hisaichi, and Army General Sugiyama Hajime for their military achievements over the years, decreed today their inclusion in the Marshal's Office and bestowed upon them the title of Marshal. Another telegram stated that the Japanese government, on the 20th of this month, ordered Navy Admiral Nagano Osami, Second Class, First Order of Merit, Grade 5; Army General Terauchi Hisaichi, Second Class, First Order of Merit, First Class of Honor, Count; and Army General Sugiyama Hajime, Third Class, First Order of Merit, First Class of Honor, to be included in the Marshal's Office and specially bestowed upon them the title of Marshal.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - Navy Admiral Nagano Osami, Chief of the Naval General Staff; Army General Terauchi Hisaichi, Supreme Commander of the Southern Army; and Army General Sugiyama Hajime, Chief of the Army General Staff, have now been awarded the highest military honor, the title of Marshal. According to Japan, the Marshal's Office was established on January 20, 1898, when the Emperor specially issued an imperial edict to assist the Emperor in military affairs. Army and Navy generals with outstanding achievements are selected and included in the Marshal's Office to serve as the Emperor's military advisors. According to the Marshal's Office regulations promulgated at that time, Article 1 stipulates that Army and Navy generals included in the Marshal's Office are specially granted the title of Marshal, and Article 2 stipulates that the Marshal's Office is the highest advisor on military affairs. Therefore, it can be known that Army and Navy generals included in the Marshal's Office are not only granted the highest military honor of the title of Marshal, but the Marshal's Office is also the highest advisor on military affairs. To date, a total of 25 people have been included in the Marshal's Office, including 14 from the Army and 11 from the Navy. However, the only Marshals who are still alive are Imperial Family members Prince Kan'in Kotohito, Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu, and Prince Nashimoto Morimasa. There are no surviving Marshals who are subjects.</p>

<h3 id="e3">General Matsui Iwane Inspects Model Camp in Guangdong; Delivers Speech After Arriving in Hong Kong <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 21st (Central News Agency) - General Matsui Iwane, after arriving in Guangzhou by plane on the 18th, inspected the Model Camp of the Pacification Commissioner's Office at 11:00 AM on the 19th. He was accompanied by the Liaison Department Chief and the Chief of Staff of the Pacification Commissioner's Office. Upon arrival, Camp Commander Chen Xun led his officers and soldiers in a welcoming parade, and then guided him to inspect all the facilities in the camp, leaving at 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 21st (Central News Agency) - Advisor Matsui Iwane, on this trip to the South for observation, arrived in Hong Kong on the 20th. On the 21st, he met with Chinese reporters and expressed his impressions of coming to Hong Kong, stating in essence: This is my sixth visit to Hong Kong. The first time was before the Chinese Revolution. Also, when I came here in 1922, I went to Guangzhou to visit Hu Hanmin, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, etc., and exchanged views with them on Sun Yat-sen's advocated Greater Asianism and Sino-Japanese cooperation issues. At that time, Hong Kong newspapers pointed out that the Greater Asianism I held was a mask for aggression against China. In the end, due to some Chinese people's misunderstanding of this idea, the Sino-Japanese Incident was unfortunately triggered. But now, Chinese people have understood that Japan's Greater Asianism is not an imperialist ideology for aggression against China. Regarding Japan's recent new policy towards China, it is consistent from beginning to end, and its purpose is to realize genuine cooperation between the two countries. At the beginning of the Sino-Japanese Incident, I fought in Shanghai, but its purpose was not to fight the Chinese people, but to eliminate the evil forces of Britain and the United States, because the evil forces of Britain and the United States exist, which caused China and Japan to meet with weapons. Japan has now begun to return concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights, so Chinese people should have a new understanding and display the true face of East Asians.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Mayor Li of Xiamen Presents Donation to Chairman <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>

The aircraft and the national defense donation presented shall be handed over to the Military Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Finance for verification and collection, and the Executive Yuan shall forward an order to the Mayor for notification.

<h3 id="e6">Commander Shibayama of Japanese Army Inspects Wuhan and Delivers Speech <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Hankou, 21st (Central News Agency) - Commander Shibayama Kaneshiro of the Japanese Army served as the Chief of the Hankou Special Affairs Department from 1939 to 1940 and made great contributions to the post-war reconstruction of Wuhan. Mr. Shibayama came to Hankou again yesterday. Yesterday morning, he inspected the 29th Division of the Army and conducted a review. He expressed his gratitude for the division's achievements in fighting alongside friendly forces. At 5:00 PM, he met with reporters at the Provincial Government in Yihua Village and expressed his impressions. Mr. Shibayama first said, I have not been to Hankou for three years. Compared to today, everything in Wuhan has progressed, which is inspiring. The hot weather of Hankou is what impressed me the most. Yesterday, I inspected the Chinese National Army. As for other matters, I cannot report them yet. Secondly, regarding the progress of the Chinese National Army, Mr. Shibayama stated his impressions, saying that the National Army in Wuhan, whether in terms of quality or training, has made rapid progress and can now cooperate with the Japanese Army to ensure transportation lines, maintain public order, and achieve considerable results in suppression operations. This is the result of the efforts of Chinese cadres at all levels. Other political and economic aspects are more well-organized than they were at that time. Taking the Central China Industrial Bank as an example, I am very pleased to hear about its current situation. The achievements of the new provincial and municipal administration are gradually improving due to the efforts of the Provincial Governor and Mayor. Today, I visited the 28th Division of the Hankou Army and spoke to them in the scorching sun for about 40 minutes. Their posture of standing at attention remained unchanged from beginning to end, which shows that they have been well-trained. The quality of an army depends on the quality of its commander. Although there is no shortage of excellent troops in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, in general, the local troops are superior to those in the lower reaches. However, if the Chinese Army wants to achieve true excellence, improvements are still needed in terms of organization, equipment, and pay. After I return home, I will strive to study how to build an excellent army. I have not been to Hankou for a long time and have been quite concerned, so I came to Hankou despite the hot weather. Mr. Shibayama then answered reporters' questions regarding the recent surge in the number of Chongqing military generals participating in the peace movement, saying that the new policy of January 9 has penetrated the "Chongqing Army" on the front lines, which is constantly being strongly suppressed by the Japanese Army. Chongqing has now lost the basis of its spirit of resistance, and the politics of the National Government have been put on track. Therefore, the cooperation of the Japanese side is all the more necessary. The Chongqing side is trying its best to cover up the true state of affairs, but its predicament is obvious. At this time, the politics of the National Government have been established, and the National Army can take the place of the Japanese Army to independently maintain public order and expel the Communist Army, so that the meaning of participating in the war can be realized, and public order can be established, material resources can be enriched, and productivity can be increased, so that it can serve as a logistics base for the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, the recent rise in prices and the obstruction of transportation and production are a major reason. If public order can be independently maintained, it can be resolved. If the National Army can replace the Japanese Army in maintaining public order as soon as possible, the Japanese Army can devote all its strength to destroying Britain and the United States and realizing the spirit of Sino-Japanese unity, one body, common life, and common death.</p>

The North China Japanese Army authorities believe that the current food problem is an urgent matter for stabilizing people's livelihoods and has a great impact on local stability. Therefore, it has decided to fully support all kinds of policies taken. It is hereby solemnly declared that in the future, regardless of Chinese or Japanese people, anyone who violates the food policy, hoards goods for speculation, or attempts to disrupt the food policy will be severely punished according to military law.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Japan Willing to Assist China in Achieving Self-Reliance and Independence – Tokyo Asahi Shimbun Publishes Editorial <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) – The Asahi Shimbun published an editorial today titled "A New Stage in Sino-Japanese Solidarity," stating the following: Prime Minister Tojo, in his policy speech to the 82nd Extraordinary Diet, clarified that he would fundamentally revise the treaties concluded between China and Japan and further seek to achieve a cooperative system between the two countries. This point deserves special attention. As for the content of the revision, it is not something that we can speculate on. However, the fact that Japan has spared no effort to assist China in achieving self-reliance and independence is a clear fact. Secondly, with the Chinese people as their partners, they are realizing the sincere desire for harmony and mutual assistance. From this, one can see Japan's high expectations for China. Therefore, the Chinese people should thoroughly understand that without completing the Greater East Asia War, Greater East Asia cannot be liberated, and without engaging in the construction of Greater East Asia, Greater East Asia will never have happiness. The construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere must be based on the spirit of good neighborliness and cooperation, united by the ten billion people of Greater East Asia. However, the absolute prerequisite is that China and Japan, the axis of East Asia, must thoroughly understand each other and cooperate with sincerity. It is no exaggeration to say that without complete harmony and solidarity between China and Japan, the Greater East Asia War cannot be successfully concluded. The new Japan's policy towards China, implemented in January of this year at the same time as China's entry into the war, has enabled China to break away from a century of shackles and achieve the goals of the Chinese National Revolution in abolishing unequal treaties and striving for independence and freedom. From this, one can see Japan's true intention is not to destroy China, but to complete China's independence and national prosperity. As for the current Chongqing regime, which is now engaged in resistance against Japan, it must also recognize this fact. Therefore, Japan's new policy has a profound impact on the Chongqing side, and the internal turmoil in its camp is impossible to conceal. Japan's China policy has had a great effect on resolving the incident, but it has not yet caused the anti-Japanese regime to collapse immediately. As far as the true meaning of resolving the incident is concerned, even if the anti-Japanese regime has collapsed, if the entire Chinese people do not want to participate in harmonious cooperation and mutual assistance with Japan, then the goal will still not be considered achieved. For the present, looking forward to the Chinese government enabling the people to more thoroughly understand Japan's sincerity, fundamentally breaking away from the idea of resisting Japan, and making further efforts to realize Sino-Japanese cooperation, we believe that the revision of the Sino-Japanese treaty in the future will aim to develop and realize a new path of harmony and mutual assistance between China and Japan, and will be implemented as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Rome, 21st (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency's correspondent in the Italian capital, Hohenbasshu, declared: The current relative calm on all fronts is a "the calm before the storm" phenomenon. It is predicted that a major war will erupt in the summer. Italian newspapers are taking a reserved attitude towards criticisms of various possibilities and future changes. They all say that the current calm in the war is to allow Italians to be prepared to prevent possible enemy attacks. As for the Italian domestic front, it is now actively preparing everything. This is an unprecedented phenomenon since the Fascist government came to power. Furthermore, the Italian authorities have announced the mobilization of Italian women aged +8 to 2+4. This measure is of profound significance, especially because women in southern Italy are extremely conservative and traditionally stay at home before marriage. In addition, all areas in Italy that have been bombed are still evacuating people.</p>
<p>Rome, 21st (Central News Agency) – Sweden News Agency reports: According to an order issued by the Italian Cabinet yesterday, the implementation of forced labor service in Italy was originally the responsibility of the Fascist party, but has now been transferred to the Labor Union Department to continue.</p>

According to photos taken by German reconnaissance aircraft, the losses suffered by the Anti-Axis fleet were extremely serious.</p>

<p>Buenos Aires, 21st (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from Washington: The US coal miners' strike has not improved after the second temporary resumption of work deadline expired on the night of the 20th. 570,000 coal miners across the United States have begun their third general strike. After the first two strikes, the amount of coal reserves in the steel industry and munitions factories across the United States was greatly reduced. Therefore, this general strike will have a greater impact than in the past. It is expected that most steel factories in Alabama and Pennsylvania, although they can barely maintain operations for a few more days, will eventually have to shut down. Therefore, the entire US munitions industry can be said to be in an unprecedented crisis. The citizens of Cincinnati are extremely disgusted and disappointed with both the mine owners and the miners. American public opinion is also criticizing union president Lewis for failing in negotiations and condemning the incompetence of the US government. Furthermore, the anti-strike bill recently passed by the US Congress has been sent to Roosevelt. Government officials have repeatedly requested the President to sign and punish Lewis and others, which will inevitably provoke the anger of the miners and worsen the situation.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) US Secretary of the Interior Ickes, who was originally scheduled to travel to Columbus, Ohio tonight to deliver a speech at the Governors Conference, has cancelled the above-mentioned itinerary this evening due to the sign that a national coal mine general strike will occur at midnight tonight.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 21st (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from Washington: US coal miners' union president Lewis convened a policy committee on the afternoon of the 20th to discuss what attitude to take because the wartime labor board had rejected the union's demands. The result of the discussion seems to have been to entrust Secretary of the Interior Ickes to resolve the dispute. It is reported that Frankfurter met with representatives of the union on the 20th to discuss the issue after the police were alerted. It is said that Lewis had already expressed a tough stance, saying that there was no room for negotiation with the mine owners and the wartime labor board. Therefore, Ickes began mediating. However, the policy committee has drafted a statement to clarify the union's attitude. The main content of the statement is that the temporary resumption period expired on the night of the 20th, and the 554,000 miners across the country should no longer continue to work given the attitude of the mine owners and the labor board. However, the policy committee is willing to negotiate with Ickes.</p>

<p>— Yoshida Toyosuke</p>
<p>The best way for Japanese people to understand China is to first observe everything from the standpoint of being in China. In other words, suppose you were Chinese, what would you think in that situation? In some cases, things that Japanese people would naturally find displeasing, Chinese people wouldn't get angry about. If Japanese people think that Chinese people are the same kind of people as Japanese people and don't get angry, that's a big mistake. Chinese people do get angry, and in fact, they are angry now. They know that if they get angry without thinking, disaster will soon befall them, so they don't show their anger outwardly. Judging by the appearance of Chinese people, they are different from Japanese people, so it's assumed that Chinese people are things. Japanese people are people, and Chinese people are people too. They feel hot things hot and cold things cold. No one is so stupid as to not know such a simple truth. But once it becomes a problem between nations, people can sometimes become that stupid. Let's give an example to illustrate:</p>
<p>If Japanese comrades quarrel, they don't just argue verbally like Chinese comrades; they immediately resort to physical violence. And Japanese comrades don't consider it a terrible insult to be beaten in a quarrel. However, if a Japanese person is beaten by a Chinese person in Japan, what do Japanese people think? Thinking a little further, Japanese people can't beat Chinese people in China. And the Chinese side considers being beaten a great humiliation. It's as insulting as having someone spit in a Japanese person's face. If a Chinese person spat in a Japanese person's face, what would that Japanese person think? Perhaps that Chinese person would soon be sent to the hospital!</p>
<p>I have a friend who works as a supervisor in a factory. Because a Chinese worker was lazy and couldn't work as he wanted him to, he put on a stern face to warn him. As a result, that Chinese person didn't come to work at the factory the next day, quit the company, and what's more, all of his lazy worker's friends didn't come to the company either. I said, "For Chinese people, being beaten is like having someone spit in their face for Japanese people." From then on, my friend never beat Chinese people again. My friend put himself in the position of the Chinese person and began to realize the seriousness of his actions.</p>
<p>My friend only beat one worker. If the other party was one of Shanghai's "dignitaries," what would be the result? Everyone knows that in Shanghai, there are so-called "dignitaries," who are respected and admired by Shanghai citizens, such as Mr. Wen Lant亭, Zhang Yi矚, Yuan Lv登, and Lin Geng侯, who are highly respected. Shanghai people use the affectionate term "old fathers" to respect and love these elders. In the era of chaotic political conditions in Shanghai, the status of these elders naturally became a political center. When trying to engage in social activities in Shanghai, people must first listen to the opinions of these elders and decide their attitude according to their opinions. Therefore, the social status of these dignitaries is equivalent to generals and ministers in Japan. And the reason why Shanghai society respects these elders so much is not because of their position, but because of the charisma of their personalities, so their position is quite strong. If these old gentlemen were beaten by Japanese people, Shanghai citizens would feel as if they themselves had been insulted. If a Japanese minister or general was spat on by a Chinese person, the Japanese people would not remain silent on this issue and would inevitably cause a major international problem. Therefore, when Japanese people in Shanghai beat Chinese people, it will cause unexpected and serious consequences. Looking at it this way, if the local Japanese people put themselves in the position of the Chinese people to consider things, things seem simple, but in fact, it should be known that there is a significant political impact between China and Japan. If most Japanese people have the generosity to observe everything from the standpoint of the Chinese people, the Sino-Japanese problem will present a completely different state from today! The spirit of the "Message to Japanese Soldiers" issued by the commander of the dispatched army, which has already been published, is to admonish Japanese soldiers to examine everything from the standpoint of the Chinese people. I believe that when this spirit is thoroughly implemented by the Japanese residents in China, it will be the time when the two major nations of China and Japan truly unite.

<h3 id="e36">Source of Rice for Citizens, Supply is Guaranteed, No Shortage: A Conversation with the Director of the Municipal Food Bureau <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>In order to promote wartime food administration and stabilize the entire food supply for citizens, the Municipal Food Bureau has completed the city's food system in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Food. From now on, the city's food supply will be more stable. Rice is the most important food for the people. In the past, it was supplied by the Central China Rice Distribution Cooperative, but now it has been transferred to the Rice Joint Operation Agency. Yesterday morning, a central reporter specially visited Mr. Zhang 　之, Director of the Municipal Food Bureau, to inquire about the future rice supply situation. He gave the following statement: "In the future, the purchase of rice will be handled by the Rice Joint Operation Agency under the regulations of the Ministry of Food. This kind of institutional adjustment will be more stable. Metered rationing will still be handled by the original agencies. Various rumors are purely speculation. There is absolutely no problem with the source of food for the people. The city needs more than 200,000 bags of rice per month. The rice source is abundant, and the supply is guaranteed. July and August are originally the lean months, but we can still get through them safely. In September, when the new rice is harvested, the rice supply will naturally be more abundant."</p>

<p>Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani Masayuki, returned to Japan earlier this month to discuss important official matters. Over the past two weeks, he has held important consultations with Prime Minister Tojo, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, and Greater East Asia Minister Aoki on promoting policies. He has now completed his official duties and returned to Shanghai on the 20th, along with Counselor Ota.

<h3 id="e41">Shen Bao Scholarship Fund, Registration Divided into New and Old Student Groups, Tingyunlou Holds Charity Exhibition of Calligraphy and Paintings to Help Students <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Since the active preparation of the fifth Shen Bao Scholarship Fund, it has been decided to start accepting applications from July 1. However, it is expected that there will be many applicants, so it has been decided to divide the registration into new and old student groups. When students collect the registration form, they must first specify whether they are current students or new students, so as to avoid errors. In addition, all sectors of society have spared no effort to support this scholarship fund. Tingyunlou's charity exhibition of calligraphy and paintings to help poor students, the Cheng Society's charity performance of plays for children who have dropped out of school, and donations from all sectors to establish more scholarships are all appreciated. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Charity Exhibition of Calligraphy and Paintings at Tingyunlou</p>
<p>The charity exhibition and sale of calligraphy and paintings hosted by Tingyunlou opened today (22nd) at the Daxin Art Gallery. It has collected more than 2,000 fan paintings from famous calligraphers and painters at home and abroad, which will be sold at marked prices. All proceeds will be donated to the Shen Bao scholarship fund. The initiators of this event are all well-known figures in Shanghai, and the exhibitors are all outstanding figures in the literary world. All expenses of the exhibition and the more than 2,000 custom-made fan paintings are borne by Shao Daren. The exhibitors participate in calligraphy and paintings completely as donations and do not calculate remuneration. The Daxin Art Gallery originally charged a commission on each item, but it has also generously waived it. All of these efforts are to benefit poor students and cultivate talents for society. It is hoped that there will be no lack of sympathy in the country, and that people will actively compete to purchase and jointly support this charity event. The origin of the event is recorded below:</p>
<p>Cheng Society Scheduled to Give a Charity Performance of a Play</p>
<p>The Cheng Society, composed of some students from various universities, will respond to the Shen Bao scholarship fund during the summer vacation. It is scheduled to give a charity performance of the historical costume drama "Wu Zetian" at the Xuangong Theater on July 3, 4, and 5. All income, except for frugal expenses, will be donated to the two newspapers' scholarship fund.</p>
<p>Meixin Primary School Donates Scholarships</p>
<p>In addition, the Meixin Middle School on Sapo賽路 Road sent a letter donating ten scholarships. Mr. Kang Lai釗 donated 1,000 yuan raised from gifts from relatives and friends for his wife's birthday and grandson's one-month celebration to the scholarship fund of this newspaper. Thank you.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Mutual Assault between Police and Vendors Occurs at Central Market Yesterday <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>At 2:00 p.m. yesterday, a dispute occurred between street vendors and market gate guards at the Central Market on North Xizang Road, resulting in mutual assaults and injuring one police officer and several vendors. The incident was triggered by the market police's spot check of vendors' registration certificates. These registration certificates are not usually strictly checked. Yesterday, the enforcement was suddenly strict, resulting in many vendors who had not registered and had no certificates, or who had certificates but did not carry them, being refused entry to the market. In an instant, hundreds of people gathered outside the market, inquiring of the police. The police, seeing the large number of people, resorted to force to disperse them. The vendors refused to obey, leading to mutual assaults. When the market police captain arrived, the crowd had already dispersed. The injured were sent to the hospital for treatment, and the incident was reported to the market authorities. They are now studying ways to improve the gate management.</p>
<p>"Heavenly flowers, diligent irrigation to make them flourish; auspicious metals appearing on the earth, skillful molding to make them tools. Those called national treasures are truly the youth. If people are not taught, the country will have nothing to rely on. This is the effect of Wei Wen收's respect, diligence, and study, and Goujian's merit of living, gathering, teaching, and training. Now, gold is expensive, rice is like pearls, and firewood is like cassia. Poor scholars find it difficult to live in peace in their homes, and many orphans drop out of school on the road. We and others are secretly worried, ashamed of having no great mansions, thinking to strive to do our best, using our meager abilities. Therefore, we have solicited two thousand pages of fans and invited calligraphers and painters from home and abroad to donate calligraphy and paintings. We will hold an exhibition and charity sale at the Daxin Art Gallery, and donate all the proceeds to the Shen Bao scholarship fund to help the poor and nurture talents. However, things rely on the strength of the masses. We hope that righteous persuasion and benevolent giving will jointly fulfill our grand wish. We want to make the flowering brush a testament to the cultivation of the wisdom of scholars; we also want to make the money spread on the ground a blessing to the benevolent winds of the broad seat. Respectfully."</p>
<h3 id="e43">Materials Investigation Committee Establishes Chinese and Japanese Investigators, Thoroughly Investigates Hoarding and Rectifies the Source, Chairman Chen Expresses His Views <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Materials Investigation Committee has been formally established and will begin its work immediately. Mayor Chen of the city, who is also the chairman of the committee, spoke yesterday about the tasks, directions, and aspirations of the committee after its establishment: The Shanghai Materials Investigation Committee held its first Sino-Japanese joint meeting yesterday. The members present and the matters resolved have been reported in the newspapers. The members came from Nanjing especially, and their enthusiastic participation is greatly appreciated. The most important point is the agreement to establish Chinese and Japanese investigators, and to establish the committee's and investigators' offices immediately. The investigators will begin their work soon. In the future, the materials held by people of any nationality inside and outside the city and concessions will be investigated at any time and anywhere in accordance with the authority granted by the committee. From registration to inspection of public and private warehouses and private storage, all will be handled by the relevant agencies designated by the committee, so as to detect materials in the most expeditious manner. If this is carried out, hoarders will find it difficult to hide. As for the materials seized, they will be handled in accordance with government laws and regulations. Wartime materials should be concentrated and utilized, on the one hand to meet the needs of the war, and on the other hand to stabilize people's livelihood. If merchants and private individuals can deeply understand righteousness, implement national policies, and cooperate in the war, seeking only legitimate business profits, then the government can regulate supply and demand and coordinate responses under the implementation of control policies. However, in recent years, even in Shanghai alone, unscrupulous merchants have taken advantage of wartime opportunities to hoard and speculate, seeking only huge profits and disregarding the interests of the public, even endangering the future of the country. It goes without saying that they have violated the laws, but because they have hindered the needs of the war, their crime is greater than profiting. Since the government has recognized the problem of hoarding, it is also paying attention to legitimate supply and demand. Therefore, the investigation and handling of hoarding, the dispatch of personnel to thoroughly investigate, has been reported in the newspapers. Now, in order to further rectify the source, the committee has been established, with Chinese and Japanese members working together and thoroughly investigating, so that unscrupulous merchants have no place to hide and hoarding has no place to conceal. With the materials no longer in the hands of a few hoarders, and able to circulate, prices will naturally tend to be flat, which is the purpose of the establishment of this committee and its only task.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Police Headquarters Promulgates Special Self-Defense Precautions, Lao Zha District Special Police Managed by Police Station, Each Industry as a Unit of One Company <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>In order to adapt to the needs of the environment, the Police Headquarters has ordered various public places to organize special self-defense groups to assist patrol police and existing self-defense group members in maintaining public security. Most public places have followed the order and organized themselves one after another and started performing their duties. However, there are still many who do not understand the responsibilities of the special self-defense groups and the allocation of members. Recently, in order to correct this shortcoming, the Police Headquarters issued notices to various public places, elaborating on the points to be noted in the organization of special self-defense groups.</p>
<p>Special Self-Defense Precautions</p>
<p>There are nine points to be noted: (1) Public places of considerable scale (dance halls, restaurants, cinemas, bathhouses, etc., the register is prepared by the detective office) should send one or several employees to patrol every day. (2) The personnel assigned to this task are called "special self-defense." (3) Special self-defense personnel are exempt from guard duty at Baojia pavilions and police duties. (4) Special self-defense personnel should be equipped with a white armband with the letters GCS (the first letters of special self-defense in Western characters) and the Chinese characters "Special Civilian Police" in black, which will be supplied by the police station. (5) The duties of special self-defense begin when the place of employment of each self-defense opens for business, and end only after everyone in the place has completely left. (6) The manager or person in charge of each public place should prepare a weekly duty roster for each employee assigned to special self-defense. One copy of the roster should be prominently displayed in the office of each place, and another copy should be sent to the Baojia office of the police station. Any changes in duty should be notified to the police station in writing within 24 hours. (7) Special self-defense personnel should pay attention to checking for packages or objects left in the place by customers that are suspicious in form or weight. If suspicious packages are found, the special self-defense personnel should immediately notify the person in charge of the place and the police station. Under no circumstances should the suspicious objects be moved. If there is a danger of danger, all people in the room where the package or object was found should be completely evacuated. (8) If customers have conversations about actions that violate public order, the special self-defense personnel should immediately report to the police station. (9) Under any circumstances, special self-defense personnel should be careful when performing inspection work. The civilian police in the Lao Zha district are managed by the police station.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Association held its second general membership meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM in the new meeting hall on the fourth floor of the Asia Building on the Bund. They also bid farewell to Mr. Kanjiyama Kanroku, the association's secretary, who is transferring to the Tianjin Mitsui &amp; Co. branch as manager. The following Japanese members attended: Ishido Giichi, Hayakawa Toshio, Nishimura Goro, Nishikawa Akitsugu, Horie Kuneo, Okamoto Yaichi, Washio Isoichi, Kawaguchi Kenichi, Katsuta Misao, Kanjiyama Kanroku, Tsutsumi Takashi, Nakagawa Yasutaro, Murakawa Yoshimi, Muto Takeji, Hishida Itsuji, Kurimoto Toraji, Yamanaka Kiichi, Yamamoto Takeo, Fujino Seitaro, Osanai Shin, Kodama Chojiro, Aburaya Kyoichi, Aoki Setsu, Sakayori Hatsugoro, Sawai Kenkichi, Monden Kosei, etc. The following Chinese members attended (listed by stroke count of surname): Wang Boyuan, Wang Haibo, Wang Huailian, Ren Shigang, Ren Xiaoshan, Zhu Sensheng, Shao Shuhua, Zhou Youmo, Lin Kanghou, Yu Zongcheng, Tang Jusheng, Sun Ruihuang, Yuan Ludeng, Zhang Zhifang, Xu Guanqun, Xu Xiaochu, Xu Jingfu, Guo Shun, Chen Binhe, Chen Riping, Huang Jiangquan, Huang Yuyi, Dong Daoning, Ye Fuxiao, Yu Zhaoxing, Wen Lanting, Zhao Jinqing, Zhao Rutiao, Wei Shanfu, Gu Nanqun, Gu Gongmo, etc. The following guests were present: Minister Tajiri, Major General Oka, Secretary Hirota, Secretary Hanamizu, Secretary Nakata, Consul Iwai, Vice Consul Fukuma, Vice Consul Hirata, Director Pan Da, Former Director Feng Qian, Director Sun Mingqi, Chief Cui Jingyu of the Municipal Government, and over 200 reporters from various newspapers. The chairman of the meeting was Wen Lanting.</p>
<p>Wen Lanting's Speech</p>
<p>First, Mr. Wen Lanting delivered a speech, the original text of which is as follows: "It has been four months since the Association convened its general membership meeting on February 25th. Originally, the Association's affairs should have been actively carried out, but due to the busy schedules of the members and the lack of a suitable meeting place, progress was delayed. Thanks to the assistance of various friendly foreign agencies, especially the enthusiastic support of the naval attaché's office, we were able to lease this well-equipped meeting place. Here, all of our members should express our deep gratitude. At the last membership meeting, in addition to welcoming new members, we also welcomed Minister Tajiri, Consul General Yano, and other gentlemen from the embassy.</p>
<p>"I remember that Minister Tajiri said at the time: 'You may have misunderstood Japan's military, territorial, and even economic ambitions to conquer China in the past. In fact, Japan's intention is not to conquer China. Japan always views China as a friend and desires to make China independent and to respect its autonomy and sovereignty.</p>
<p>"'I came to Shanghai last November and was deeply surprised by the economic decline of Shanghai and the severance of its relations with the interior. Therefore, I have been striving to revive Shanghai's economy as soon as possible and to facilitate the flow of goods in the interior. When the scope of activities of Chinese and Japanese industrialists and businessmen is broadened, the restrictions on the movement of goods should naturally be eased.</p>
<p>"'However, no one should take advantage of the extensive scope of trade to hoard goods for personal gain, nor should anyone handle goods arbitrarily for the sake of profit. In this regard, I hope that industrialists and businessmen will take the initiative to develop appropriate measures. In the current situation, we must be vigilant against anything that smacks of war aims.'</p>
<p>"In these four months, Japan's new policy toward China has been gradually implemented, such as the concretization of the return of concessions, the organization of the Commercial Control Association, and the crackdown on hoarding. These are all the result of Minister Tajiri's efforts, and we express our sincere respect and gratitude.</p>
<p>"We are very pleased that Minister Tajiri, General Oka, and other officials have graced today's membership meeting with their presence. We would like to ask Minister Tajiri to address us and give us guidance. Furthermore, Mr. Kanjiyama, the secretary of our association, will soon be transferring to the Tianjin Mitsui branch as manager. He has worked diligently for the association in the past. Today, we bid him farewell and present him with a specially made silver cup as a memento, and we wish him boundless future development."</p>
<p>Minister's Speech</p>
<p>Following this, Minister Tajiri gave a speech, saying in brief: "The goal of building the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is to liberate the countries of East Asia. Within the East Asian region, all countries, regardless of size or strength, should cooperate with each other in order to reap the greatest strength. For example, one plus one equals two is a mathematical certainty. In my view, under the current circumstances, when one country cooperates with another, its strength is not just two, it must become three, or four, five... Therefore, the construction of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere hopes that each country can cooperate with each other, not fight each other, and unite together in order to increase the great strength of the entire East Asia." The recent Japanese special session of parliament included a report on diplomatic policy by Foreign Minister Guang. He put forth "mutual benefit and equality." The United Kingdom and the United States have also used this as a diplomatic slogan in the past, but in reality, what the United Kingdom called "mutual benefit" was purely based on the interests of one country. However, the "equality and mutual benefit" of the countries within the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is completely different. It is under a common goal that each contributes all of its remaining strength in order to build a new order in East Asia.</p>
<p>"The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is like a large family. The head of the household and the family members each have their own responsibilities and duties, and they work together to ensure the stability of the entire family so that the entire family can achieve happiness. In the past, the countries of East Asia were invaded by the United Kingdom and the United States, and the forces of discord have now been driven out. In the future, there should be no factors of discord.</p>
<p>"Japan's hope for China is that China will be successful in its revival and reconstruction. The Shanghai business community in the past was deeply influenced by the egoism of British and American merchants, who only sought their own great profits and disregarded the public interest. In the future, I sincerely hope that the business community within the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, especially the economic circles of Shanghai, will thoroughly change their business goals. While personal profits are necessary, the public interest must be taken into consideration."</p>
<p>Report on Association Affairs</p>
<p>Finally, Secretary Dong Daoqing reported on the affairs of the Association:</p>
<p>"(1) Brief Overview of Association Affairs: Since its establishment last September, the Association has received support from all sides, and its affairs have made increasing progress. In the beginning, No. 301 Hong Kong Road, the Bank Association, was used as a temporary office. Later, through the efforts of Japanese Deputy Director Komuro and Secretaries Kurimoto and Kanjiyama, the Association was able to lease Nos. 408 to 411 and No. 3 on the fourth floor of the Xingya Building as its new headquarters in May of this year. Furthermore, the Association originally had 100 members. Since February of this year, in accordance with the resolution of the first board meeting, 20 new members have been recruited from both sides, for a total of 140 members. All of them are highly respected figures in the industrial, commercial, and financial circles of this city, so that we can jointly plan the development of the Association's affairs. This is truly something to be celebrated for the future of the Association.</p>
<p>"(2) Finances: The Association's finances currently rely entirely on membership fees, but membership fee income is limited. As the Association's affairs progress in the future, expenditures will increase accordingly. Measures should be taken in advance. I will report separately as follows:</p>
<p>"1. Revenue and Expenditure: The Association's membership fee is 50 yuan per month per member. Before March of this year, there were 100 members, with a monthly membership fee income of 5,000 yuan. Because expenses were kept to a minimum, this could be maintained with effort. Any shortfall was made up with the 20,000 yuan of founding fees paid by the founders. The rent for the new headquarters alone is 9,195 yuan, and other expenses such as water, electricity, and property taxes have also increased, resulting in a monthly shortfall of about 10,000 yuan. The second board meeting resolved to raise 60,000 yuan for the next six months, plus 100,000 yuan for the equipment of the new headquarters, for a total of 160,000 yuan. 2. Increase Membership Fees: As the Association's expenses will increase in the future, the original membership fee of 50 yuan per month per member will not be sufficient. Starting in October of this year, the monthly fee will be increased by 100 yuan. This is hereby submitted to the general meeting for ratification. 3. Endowment Fund: In order to develop the Association's affairs, the second board meeting has resolved to raise an endowment fund of 1 million yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. Members will jointly raise the funds and are free to make donations. This is submitted to the general meeting for ratification. 4. The addition of approximately 100,000 yuan of furniture for the new headquarters is hereby submitted to the general meeting for ratification. 5. Soon, a simple dining hall is planned to be set up for the use of members."</p>
<p>After the report, Chairman Wen, on behalf of the board, telegraphed Secretary Kanjiyama a silver cup. Secretary Kanjiyama then gave a speech of thanks. Afterwards, refreshments were served, photographs were taken, and a movie was shown. The meeting adjourned around 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>Economic Circles' Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e49">On Centralized Trading of Chinese Stocks <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Thirty-five Chinese stock brokerage firms in this city, after being granted licenses to resume business, are reportedly preparing to temporarily organize a "Chinese Stock Brokerage Association" in order to earnestly adopt a policy of self-discipline and plan for centralized trading. This is a precursor to the organization of a formal stock exchange and the establishment of a formal stock market, and should not be taken lightly.</p>
<p>On February 24th of this year, this column stated: "In the current wartime economic environment, there is a need to establish a formal market for Chinese stocks as soon as possible. We hope that the authorities will convene representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors to discuss the establishment of a formal stock market based on the local environment and with reference to the established practices of other countries. At the same time, they should instruct them to lead stock brokerage firms in organizing a formal association to engage in the proper operation of Chinese stocks in accordance with laws and regulations, so that industrial and commercial enterprises can obtain flexible funding and promote production through normal Chinese stock trading."</p>
<p>According to recent news reports, the government, in order to guide idle capital into proper investment channels, has reportedly approved the resumption of the securities exchange. The organization of the "Association" by Chinese stock brokerage firms at this time demonstrates that the centralized trading of Chinese stocks will certainly become a reality. Its significance can be explained as follows: (1) Centralized trading can eliminate the independent business practices of Chinese stock brokerage firms and make the Chinese stock market an open market, preventing the harboring of stock speculation. (2) Centralized trading can facilitate all kinds of communication, make stock turnover more flexible, and prevent stock prices from being manipulated behind the scenes, so that they do not fluctuate erratically. (3) After centralized trading, securities trading can gradually guide idle capital into the production sectors of national capital. This is the basic goal of securities trading, especially in today's China—a time when foreign goods are disappearing and domestic goods are rising. Improving production, increasing output, and improving products are the only prerequisites for increasing the value of securities.</p>
<p>Therefore, the future of Chinese stocks should be judged by the future of production enterprises. If any other measure is used to assess Chinese stocks, it would not only be too superficial and unreasonable, but also would not be instructive.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Silver and Money Shops to Adjust and Increase Deposit Interest Rates Starting in the Second Half of the Year <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Silver and money shops have decided to increase deposit interest rates in principle in order to attract idle capital from society. Each bank and money shop will handle this with reference to market conditions and will begin to implement it starting in the second half of the year (i.e., July 1st). Yesterday, it was learned that each bank and money shop has adjusted the interest rates on commercial, savings, and trust deposits. They especially emphasize the interest rates on time deposits. Previously, the maximum annual interest rate was 1%, but now it has been increased to 1.5%, depending on the term of the time deposit. The interest rate for one year is 6% or 8%, for two to five years it is 8% or 1%, and for more than five years the interest rate is above 1%. The interest rate on demand deposits has been increased from 0.1% to 0.4% or 0.5%. For example, Juxingcheng Bank has announced: "The interest rate on all types of demand deposits in this bank, originally set at an annual rate of 3%, will be uniformly increased to an annual rate of 5% starting from July 1st of this year." The use of deposit funds will be handled entirely in accordance with laws and regulations and will be used for production and construction projects, such as loans to agriculture and industry. However, the above-mentioned loans will be given special scrutiny, and will be rejected if they do not meet the established standards, in order to prevent speculation and hoarding.</p>
<h3 id="e51">The Accounting of Siming and Other Banks Has Been Completed, and Reorganization Will Be Implemented in Mid-July, Following the Same Steps as the Central and Bank of Communications <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The National Government's Ministry of Finance believes that it is necessary to thoroughly reorganize the Siming, China General Chamber of Commerce, China Industrial, and China National Products Banks, which were jointly operated by officials and merchants before the incident, in order to dissolve their relationship with Chongqing. All government shares should be taken over by the government. Therefore, it specially ordered the Financial Inspection Office to work with the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai Office to reorganize and investigate the accounts of the four banks and decided to reorganize them. All government shares will be taken over by the Central Reserve Bank. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai Office and the Financial Inspection Office have completed the investigation of the accounts under order. They submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance for approval yesterday. According to a Central News Agency reporter, among the four banks, except for the China National Products Bank, which is a branch in Shanghai, the other three banks—China General Chamber of Commerce, Siming, and China Industrial—are all headquartered in Shanghai. Government shares account for 90% of the shares, while merchant shares account for only 10%. Therefore, the government's reorganization will re-evaluate the amount of shares held by officials and merchants. The reorganization steps will be roughly the same as the reorganization of the Central and Bank of Communications. All business policies and important personnel of the four banks will be designated and determined by the Ministry of Finance. It is heard that the reorganization of the four banks will be implemented around mid-July.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Constancy and Contingency <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Sha Lei</p>
<p>Constancy is easy, but contingency is not!</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, everything is rational, following steps in an unhurried manner. Dealing with it in this way reduces the chances of committing great errors to almost zero. This is not only because there are certain rules to follow and ample time for broad consultation, but also because the river is fundamentally calm. Even a small boat, even if the driver's knowledge and experience are immature and lacking in skill, will not likely face the tragedy of capsizing. Although it may take more effort and time and involve more twists and turns, reaching the other shore is not difficult.</p>
<p>But things in the world are never always smooth sailing. As the saying goes, "Trouble arises unexpectedly, disaster starts within." At this time, if one panics, loses focus, and becomes speechless, like a storm suddenly striking the sea, one will be intimidated by the wind and tossed about by the waves, unable to hold the rudder and oars, and the ship will naturally lose its balance. Coupled with inappropriate responses, the rudder may be mistakenly turned, the oars lost, and the turbulent waves will engulf everything.</p>
<p>Contingency is a moment of great urgency. The first thing to do is to maintain a calm attitude, assess the direction and degree of the oncoming force, and look for its weaknesses. At this time, the intellect and vision honed by knowledge and experience will emit the light of wit and keen insight. It will unleash the power of a strong wind to sweep away everything!</p>
<p>Mediocrity and competence are only clearly distinguished in constancy. Contingency will be a touchstone. The glory of life, like gold refined a hundred times, becomes more brilliant the more it is polished. This will forever be shown in the annals of human history.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Should Love be Discussed During School Years? <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Ai Ying</p>
<p>A Humble Opinion on the Merits and Demerits of Co-education</p>
<p>In its societal commentary on the 5th of this month, this newspaper, under the title "A Re-examination of the Merits and Demerits of Co-education," discussed the advantages and disadvantages of co-education, claiming that "from theoretical verification to reality, the co-educational system has not yielded results as beneficial as predicted." Moreover, it asserted, "the reality is that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages." Indeed, we should acknowledge the prevailing negative situations in many secondary schools, such as the excessive pursuit of freedom, indulgence in frivolous activities, reckless discussions of love, and neglect of academic pursuits. However, I believe this is not merely an educational issue but is closely linked to the family and society as a whole. In other words, it is a part of the entire societal problem, and its remedy must be intertwined with other societal issues.</p>
<p>Considering the co-educational system itself, it is inherently good. Whether we examine it from a historical, socio-political, or educational perspective, it has reasons and value for its existence. In my humble opinion, the so-called "reckless discussions of love" are not entirely a result of co-education. If "reckless discussions of love" only arose because of co-education, the solution would be simple: abolish co-education, and the problem would be completely solved. However, such a solution is not thorough. To thoroughly remedy this malpractice, at least the following issues must be addressed:</p>
<p>(1) The issue of family education. As the proverb says, "The mother is the cradle of humanity." This means that the foundation of a person is built upon family education. Looking back at our country, most parents generally do not pay much attention to their children's education within the family (although there are exceptions). Especially in wealthy families in Shanghai, with very few exceptions, they simply do not prioritize family education. They only know how to indulge their children, thinking that as long as they raise them and send them to school, they have fulfilled their responsibilities. This is a terribly misguided mentality! Therefore, if parents want their children to improve, they must set an example themselves and thoroughly emphasize family education to be effective.</p>
<p>(2) The issue of school education. Education is inherently a sacred undertaking, shouldering the responsibility of cultivating well-rounded individuals. However, the corruption of the education system in Shanghai is far more serious than the "reckless discussions of love" arising from co-education! They use education as a tool for profit and wealth. What they focus on is not cultivating well-rounded individuals, but how to make their businesses thrive. This has led to ugly phenomena such as infighting and mutual exclusion among "competitors." In such circumstances, students who were already poorly behaved become worse, and those who were originally better become corrupted. This must be thoroughly reformed.</p>
<p>(3) The issue of the social environment. As the aforementioned societal commentary stated, "The social landscape of Shanghai is, undeniably, a trap of extravagance and dissipation." Here, both government-run and private casinos open their jaws like bloodthirsty beasts, relentlessly devouring people's money and even their lives! Here are low-brow, cheesy movies; disguised and tempting dance halls; and the most expensive luxury cosmetics and decorations... With so many "great places" to go, it is only natural that "going to movies together, dancing together, secretly taking money from home," and "enjoying dressing up, wearing makeup, and acting strangely" will continue to occur frequently. The authorities should also use their utmost determination to thoroughly eradicate gambling, improve the content of films, correct the purpose of dancing, and limit or even prohibit the production and sale of luxury cosmetics. In this way, if there are no traps in society, young people will not be in danger of falling into them. If there is no danger of falling into them, they will all readily embrace goodness, and there will be no major drawbacks.</p>
<p>(4) The issue of youth themselves. Can young people in their student years discuss love? My answer is yes. Because discussing love is inherently a part of youth. If young people don't discuss love, when will they? However, we should not engage in "reckless" discussions of love. First, we must establish a correct view of love. Love should not be merely for the sake of desire or temporary emotional impulses. True love is built on mutual work, the development of each other's talents, the pursuit and effort to gain mutual knowledge, and concern for social causes! Otherwise, it will be like fleeting clouds, easily dispersed. Understanding this makes it clear that love is not harmful or unhelpful. Overemphasizing emotions and recklessly engaging in love is akin to suicide. Emphasizing reason and engaging in correct love is akin to rebirth. In such circumstances, what sustains love is not money, going to movies, dancing, or wearing makeup, but the pursuit of knowledge, passion for work, and the development of talents. Of course, I am not against entertainment, but entertainment should be proper. True entertainment contains the meaning of "recreation" – restoring the spirit. In this sense, music, playing ball, painting, walking, etc., are all excellent methods. If one must seek particularly stimulating things, that is definitely not true entertainment. Therefore, those with a correct understanding of love will not hinder their future. On the contrary, it is a powerful factor in creating the future.</p>
<h3 id="e62">### Necessary Conditions for Success <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Fei</p>
<p>Although the determining conditions for a person's success are multifaceted, there is only one primary condition: having determination. Whether or not they can put in the effort to achieve great things!</p>
<p>Intelligence, knowledge, guidance from the environment, and encouragement from friends can all be said to be conditions that contribute to a person's success. However, if the person in question does not have the "determination" or "effort" to work hard, no matter how much guidance, encouragement, or innate talent and profound knowledge they possess, it will all be for naught. Among those who wander and die or beg from door to door, one cannot say that they do not possess the aforementioned conditions.</p>
<p>Conversely, there are many who are not inherently intelligent or who have not had the opportunity to acquire knowledge but still achieve success. Liu Bei and Zhu Yuanzhang were merely "village rascals" and "cowherds," yet they ultimately succeeded as "political leaders of an era" and "national heroes." The reason is that they possessed "determination" and the ability to "work hard."</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen's success in revolution also depended on his unwavering "determination" and his persistent and continuous efforts despite numerous setbacks. This is also a very evident fact.</p>
<p>Eight or nine years ago, I had a relative who, as a child, was extremely naughty and rogue-like. Even at the age of twenty, he still wandered aimlessly, neglecting his duties. As a result, all the relatives despised him, and his parents and family hated him. Everyone affirmed that he was "a good-for-nothing." Later, he suddenly realized his mistakes and changed his attitude completely, becoming a very good person. Soon after, he applied to the Central Military Academy at the time, and after graduating, he quickly rose to the position of regimental commander or higher. Who could have predicted that!</p>
<p>Therefore, if we want to achieve our ideal goals and become extraordinary people, we must first have "determination" and then strive with an unyielding spirit. One day, we will surely succeed.</p>
<h3 id="e63">### Trying <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Zhong</p>
<p>"Trying" can be said to be the initial step in turning ideals into action. If you harbor wonderful ideals but are afraid to try, those ideals will remain ideals and can never become reality. Because "trying" is the starting point for achieving success.</p>
<p>Through "trying," we can understand the overall trend and gain valuable lessons.</p>
<p>What is most important is that before trying something, you must carefully consider it with reason and confidence, have a broad vision, and thoroughly understand the advantages and disadvantages. Otherwise, trying rashly may lead to the tragedy of "one wrong step leading to eternal regret." Because "trying" is not only the starting point of the glorious road to success, but also the starting point of the diverging path to failure!</p>

<p>Chao-Shan has suffered a prolonged drought, causing withered crops, barren lands stretching for miles, and people starving to death daily. Furthermore, the epidemic of Tiger Plague is rampant, with abandoned corpses scattered everywhere. The disaster's devastation rivals that of North China. People from Chaozhou Fellow-Townsmen Association, Chaozhou Association Hall, and other Shanghainese, driven by kinship and shared pain, have established the Shanghai Chao-Shan Disaster Relief Association. They are operating out of the Chaozhou Association Hall on Yangxing Street. In addition to submitting a request to the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Welfare for swift relief, yesterday they also convened a fundraising committee to plan the collection of donations for disaster relief.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Free Medical Consultation and Medication <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>(1) The Wu Sheng Association, organized by the Industrial Raw Materials Market, is offering free medical consultation and medication starting on the 1st of this month. Medication and consultation vouchers are available. The consultation vouchers can be used to visit Dr. Zhang Hongyuan's clinic at 25 Renji Lane, Ximen Road, French Concession, free of charge (9:00 AM to 12:00 PM). Afterward, patients can have their prescriptions filled at Yu Liangxin Chinese Pharmacy in Ximen, also free of charge. Those who are suffering from both poverty and illness can go to the market at 299 Lane, Guangdong Road (Wuma Road) (west of Henan Road), second floor, to request vouchers.</p>
<p>(2) Director Liang Zanlun and Chen Chunhua of the Shanghai Yao Shan Association, located at 858 Lane, Wenning Road, hosted a tea party for guests from all walks of life. They reported on the Association's activities, which include actively doing good deeds, establishing free schools, providing rice porridge, offering free medical consultation and medication, and helping the poor and sick. These actions are truly admirable. Consultation vouchers can be obtained from the medicine department of this newspaper.</p>
<p>Shuqun Charity School: Shuqun Free Night Middle School has been newly established within Guangming Elementary School at 72 Lane, Zhangjia Garden, Maitheurst Road. It is entirely free of charge. It will temporarily offer four classes for the upper and lower semesters of the first and second years of junior high school. From today, it is accepting new students and transfer students. Impoverished out-of-school youth from all walks of life are encouraged to register promptly.</p>
<p>Sacred Learning Lecture: The Chinese Confucius Sacred Learning Association has scheduled President Zheng Shaojue to lecture on the Great Meaning of Sacred Learning and Principal Sun Zhongwan to speak on the Doctrine of the Mean, starting at 5:00 PM this afternoon. All are welcome to attend.</p>
<p>Donations and Porridge Distribution: Reader Mr. Zuo Youfa generously donated one hundred yuan to the Buddhist porridge distribution center, which has been delivered on their behalf. Thank you.</p>
