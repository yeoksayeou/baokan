<p>社評</p>
<h3>再爲助學金運動籲請捐助</h3>
<p>不久之前，本市發起　北急賑，在極短時期內，收到優良的成績，充分顯示上海市民急公好義，不甘落後於全國各地，並且足爲全國範式。現在，我們進行着比賑災更積極的助學金運動，這種運動的成敗，直接影響到本市失學靑年的前程，間接影響到全國將來的人才問題。因此，我們再度向各界特別呼籲，希望大家本其急公好義之心，繼續慷慨輸將，使本屆助學金運動獲得空前的成功。</p>
<p>目前及今後中國的復興，最重要的是人才問題，這是誰也不能否認的。我們去叩詢每一個熱誠從事國家社會復興與建設工作的人，他們異口同聲的嘆息，目前人才太缺乏了！許多事業，許多計劃之未克進行，並不是爲着缺乏資金，而是爲着缺乏眞正的人才，退十步說，就以今日上海一般企業家感想，凡是眞正發展其事業的，也莫不同樣覺得人才是第一重要的問題。今日人才之所以缺乏，自然由於五年十年前人才培養工作之進行得不够。但是，試以今日培養人才的學校及受學人數和五年十年前相比，那麼，我們不能不承認，無論如何，五年，十年前的情形，要比現在好得多。中學小學不必說了，就以專門學校及大學而論，當時的學校數和學生數，就要比今日增加一倍至數倍，我們翻閱幾年前的舊報，每逢暑寒假的招生廣吿，比較現在多，而每校就學人數，一般的也要比今日一般大中小學多上幾倍。以當年學校與受學者之多，尙且造成人才缺乏的結果，以今日學校及學生之少，推想到五年十年以後中國的復興建設與人才問題，凡屬有心人，孰能不爲之寒心！</p>
<p>爲着將來社會國家的復興與建設，我們不能不在今日加緊培養人才。但是，按之實際，以全國文化最發達的上海而論，却存在着嚴重而普遍的靑少年失學的現象。這種現象之造成，固然因事變後，各級學校之恢復工作，還沒有達到理想的程度，以至有學校不足之感，以及專門師資缺乏，物質設施缺乏，因而一般學校內容未能充實之外，當前最嚴重最普遍的原因，却是由於一般中等以下家庭的子女，一般公務人員以至各校敎師的子弟，都陷於無力就學的狀態。甚至供給小學費用已很勉强，因此，我們常常聽到「敎人子女者，自己的子女無人敎」的嘆息。同樣的，一般中級以至高級公務員們，也很少有力量維持其子女中學費用的了。至於大學及專門學校的費用，決非中等以下家庭所能負担，只成爲少數富家子弟的學府。姑不問此種富家子弟的學府的內容及其敎育成果如何，如此少數的學生，將來縱使人人成爲專材，也決不敷國家社會的需要！因此，目前資助無力就學的靑少年，使不再被屏於學校門外，養成將來多數人材，無論從社會的意義或國家利害上說，都具有最重要的意義。</p>
<p>本報本屆助學金運動，募集助學金的目標，暫定爲一百五十萬元，在今日的上海，這一個數宇，並不是怎樣驚人的鉅額，但是，如果能够在一個月期內順利完成，就可以援助小學生一千五白名，（每名二百五十元，共計三十七萬五千元），初中學生一千名，（每名三百五十元，共計三十五萬元。）高中學生一千名，（每名四百五十元，共計四十五萬元。）大學或專科學生五百名，（每名五百五十元，共計二十七萬五千元。）工商學生二百五十名，（每名二百元，共計五萬元。）使能繼續木學期的學業；也就是說，這一百五十萬元，可以在本學期內使四千二百五十偭靑年不致失學。以本市人口之衆多，以本市熱心人士之衆多，投鞭可以斷流，聚金可以成塔，誠得富而好善者出而示範，再接再厲，預期目標必不難在最短期內達到。昨承盛幼盦先生個人慨助十萬元，其熱心義舉，固可欽佩，而諄諄以嘉惠淸寒爲念，其識見之遠大，對社會國家培養人材之忠誠，尤爲難能可貴！我們代表接受助學的靑少年謹向盛先生致其敬意。深信上海不乏與盛先生具有同樣卓越之識見與熱誠者，如能不讓盛先生專美於前，踴躍捐助，則祗須如盛先生者十五人，本屆目標即可完全達到了！當然，我們仍舊竭誠歡迎小數的捐助者，我們希望有卓見的富翁，都能以參加助舉金運動爲一種最高無上的光榮，並且以捐資助學爲新時代國民對於將來社會復興與國家建設的一種光榮的義務，我們希望每天發表的捐資助學諸君的名單，成爲中華民族自强不息的鐵證，用這名單來鼓舞起民族文化復興的運動。</p>
<p>華北急賑募捐中，上海各界市民個人及團體曾經取得了光榮的錦標，我們熱烈期待在這次助學金運動中，同樣表現出中華民族急公好養的優越性格來！我們敬代千萬失學靑少年，敬代急需人才的社會和國家，向本市有卓見的富翁竭誠呼籲！</p>

<h3>日四屆中央協力會議　東條首相發表演說　對東亞各民族諒解日眞意愈信戰爭前途有勝利把握</h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　日第四次中央協力會議，於十四日上午九時在大東亞會館舉行，日東條首相兼大政翼贊會總裁於開會時，首行申述其此次訪問南方之所歷及勝利之確信謂，余前曾歷訪中華民國滿洲國以及菲島，此决又歷訪泰國與南方各地，目睹大東亞各國家各民族對日本眞意之諒解，舉十億民族總力，集中於擊域英美之途，對日本實行全而協力之實現。又目睹巨大國防資源逐漸戰力化之狀况，余之大東亞戰爭必勝信急，已愈堅强，常此時際，日本決不惜對此諸國家諸民族，予以最大之援助與協力，故現在遂漸採取具體措置大東亞戰爭之必勝態勢，及大東亞新秩序之建設基礎，如此堅固，誠堪慶幸，關於歐洲方面，則我國與德義等盟邦，日益鞏固團結，共同邁進於擊滅英美之途，實亦至堪慶慰，由於正義之戰爭，由於東亞之團結，故吾等之勝利，決不動搖，但此勝利之獲得，尤待我一億國民之異常努力與犧牲。敵人英美，現正以其所恃之物力，實行反攻，其氣勢雖不可輕視，然此亦爲我國所料知者，故毫不足懼，蓋吾人於此必勝態勢下，唯有昻揚戰意，發揮不屈不撓之堅定精神，向大東亞戰爭之最後勝利堂堂邁進也。最後首相並就集結國民總力增强戰力事，切望全國國民一致奮起，意謂前者政府曾召開臨時議會，得以討議整備企業食糧緊急增產等問題，此即力謀戰力之增强者，然爲舉國內之總力，以謀增强戰力，則必須每一國民挺身而起，以一爲國捐軀之精神。爲國家而奮鬥，故切望我一億國民，苦樂相共，戮力團結以發抑各人所具之能力，更應加緊努力，刷新生活、節約消費，增强貯蓄，不爲任何事態所動，進而以剛健之魄力，澈底實踐淸新簡素之生活，以貢獻於國家。當此嚴重時期，發揮吾一億國民傳統情神，俾光耀國　，藉以決定人東亞千年之命運者，此實吾人重大之責任，國家　冀求者　即軍官民齋心團結，傾全力以發揮我民族性能。此亦即爲　贊聖業光　之唯一途徑。此次召開第四次中央協力會議之目的，亦即爲此故。以國民諸君滿腔之熱意，發揮確信對於戰力之增强上，必有莫大之貢獻。</p>
<p>鈴木報告企業方針</p>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　日企劃院總裁鈴木氏十四日於日中央協力會議令體大會席上，曾就前於日本第八十二决臨此議會通過之增强戰力整備企業之特法及其實施卞針等發言，要請官民一致協力，　行迅速而圓滑之整備，以應戰局之急需，茲將鈴木總裁所談要旨誌後，生產狀况爲戰力重要因素，其自去年下半年度以來，進行甚爲順利，尤以本年上半年度之前半期，已收空前良好之成績，重要產業生產所獲成績，均甚美　，於現階段爲突破緊迫化之戰局，惟有以强人之武力，始能取勝，故必須增强戰力，而增强戰力，若不立節發揮國民之總力，則不克實現急切企圖者，因爲飛機船舶兵員等等之增加，然必須切記，其某礎極爲廣汎，從來之企業整備往往因統制經濟之關係，而發生　難，乃不得不改爲自發的自衛的，而具有消極之性格，然此次之企業整備，爲期其戰力化。乃準備發動一部法律之强權，又整備方針。乃以不分其營業之優秀或腐敗，凡易於着手使之戰力化者係先加以整備，此即爲其電要之特徵，其實行方法，於勞力方面，則用若干萬勞力使之戰力化，即鋼材亦將能挪用若干萬噸，由於以上之企業整備，對經濟秩序之影響，故亦甚大，於資金方面、亦將支出數十億元現款，政府爲處理此等事態，乃施行種種方策，講求守善方法，以維持經濟秩序，並强化經濟力、現吾等須徹底認識，戰爭對吾等之要求，及戰爭之相貌，吾等必須立足於不畏任何艱難之傳統精神上戰時，以求生活之　開。</p>
<p>天羽局長痛斥英美</p>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　日情報局總裁天羽氏，於日第四次中央協力會議中，就最近一般國際情勢發表演說，大意謂，英美挑起此次之戰爭，欲圖滅亡日本，民主主義乃英美標榜之口號，彼等之民主主義不過爲英美人之民主主義或爲純粹盎格魯撒克遜民族之民族主義而已，於今已有一部份民族，不問其是否英美國籍且絕不承認其自由平等，此事已爲世所週知，彼等視爲不同種族之亞洲民族，俾欲供諸滿足彼等物資整理外，槪無所期，自日本首先覺醒後、亞洲各民族亦相繼覺醒，如今解放全亞洲之氣氛高漲，隨時均有反抗英美爭取獨立指導者蹶起。緬甸巴莫長官現正爲緬甸國之獨立而奮鬥，菲島獨立準備委員會委員長洛勒氏，亦與伐爾加斯，洛哈斯及其他各志士，正以同志之熱誠，爲菲島獨立而努力。又印度之江特拉鮑斯氏，前於東　暢述對獨立之抱負，某中曾謂，如今之印度，已　現自由之曙光，如此之良機，於今後百年內，將不復重現矣。扛特拉鮑斯氏至昭南後，已發表其組轍自由印度臨時政府之宏圖，英國錐已任命華維爾爲新任印度總督，實行以武力壓迫政治，但最後究爲壓制勝利。抑爲獨立勝利，自有必然歸趨，但吾人已深知最後之勝利，屬於正義，促起鄰邦中華民國覺醒之國民黨總理孫中山先生，於大正十二年二月廣東政府成立之時，曾謂「日太人，中國人，同爲亞洲人」，故縱使日本與中國戰爭亦不過爲兄弟閱牆之爭，而無害於兄弟之情，吾人試離却故國，束至加拿大，美國，南至澳洲。新西蘭西至南非，則感到中國人，日本人實毫無區別，但亦正因此而同被彼等拒絕入境，反之英美人、則已侵入亞洲，如中國實不啻爲英美之殖民地，中國人則不啻爲彼等之奴隸，吾人爲建設亞洲人之亞洲，實不能不一致奮鬥，觀今之情勢，誠如斯言。英美之態度一今亦毫無變更，大西洋憲章中，曾聲明尊重民族精神，但其爲欺世之語，今已證諸事實，英美絲毫未受他國之威脅，何爲甘欲從事戰爭，英美人獨佔世界富源，已可安居，其戰爭之必要何在，此當爲一般美人之疑問，亦爲世界之疑問，事實所指，英美欲滅亡日本，滅亡中國，壓迫泰國，菲律賓，緬甸，印度而使亞洲人永遠化爲奴隸，藉戰爭而使彼等爲滿足其侵略世界之雄心，完成其覇世界野望。而戰爭也亞洲人之奮起，乃爲粉碎英美之桎梏，建設眞善美之世界。亞洲解放之黎明，今已降臨，亞洲之天地，亞洲之解放，道義之世界以及日本之生死完全在此一戰，故此戰爭殆爲定乾坤，創世紀之戰爭。</p>
<h3>日經濟使節團　今日離京來滬　中日長官歡宴餞別</h3>
<p>南京十四日中央社電　日經濟考察團抵京三日，迭與我朝野上下開誠懇談，交換意見，結果至爲圓滿。茲悉該團在京任務已吿完成，預定於十五日上午離京赴滬，轉道返國。</p>

<p>南京十四日中央社電　日經濟考察團抵京已兩日，十四日爲第三日，上午八時該團一行赴中山陵園恭謁國父陵寢致敬，中午往訪褚外交部長懇談，由褚外長假中日文化協會設筵招待，席問褚外長及小倉團是均懇切致詞，情緒至爲融洽。</p>
<p>南京十四日中央社電　中央電訊社爲歡迎日本經濟考察團抵京，特於十四日下午三時聯合日本同盟通訊社及首都各報社，假座中日文化協會，舉行經濟文　座談會。三時半座談開始，歷一小時餘始畢。綜合座談結果，大體爲以下四點，（一）目前中國經濟情形尙稱良好，所困難者乃爲通貨問題，其補教之法有二：（甲）爲從指導國民心理着手，尤　增强國民對經濟建設之認識爲要；（乙）爲使物資有合理之統一，勿使散漫，以免發生不良現象象。（二）關於中日經濟合作問題，最要者須兩國經濟界人士在心理上，精神上互相深切瞭解，彼此往來接觸宜多，袪除過去之隔閡，則合作定可順利成功。（三）關於通貨問題，現在之中國通貨統一問題，已較民國二十四年時統一舊法幣之情形，截然不同，蓋其時並非政府統一通貨，實爲英美通貨效能之延長，現在政府與民衆已緊密聯繫，預測全中國之通貨統一，必可圓滿實現。（四）關於開發問題，南方開發事宜絕對樂觀，目前除運輸問題較爲困難外，其他一切均頗圓滿。生產機構已全恢復，一切物資較前更爲豐富，例如米橡皮等均呈過剩之現象。至英美自失南洋後，一切物資甚感困難，尤其橡皮一項更爲缺乏，故英美之經濟力固不必介意，但亦不容忽視。今後祗須中日兩國國民緊密提携，共榮圈之建設定可完成。</p>

<h3>西西里東南部　戰事白熱化　大部德軍尙未出動前進英軍已遭阻遏</h3>
<p>柏林卞四日中央社電　　通社軍事特派員色托留斯上尉稱，反軸心軍利用其空軍及　軍之優越，於星期一日夜之間，以大量之生力軍，（至少有兩師至三師之衆），在西西里之東南部登陸，此　生力軍，大部份係加入美軍之第七軍，以使巴東將軍，不僅可保守其第一次登陸後在里卡達及吉拉所設立之　頭堡，並可將此項橋頭堡　張在里卡達橋頭堡方面。加拿大軍隊，在美國司令官指揮之下作戰，已向西面及北面前進的十二公里。巴東將軍之右翼，現時已自吉拉向東面及東南面推進至若　程度，並能否與在波薩洛至洛索里尼一帶地區作戰之蒙甘茂萊將軍之左翼保持不斷之聯絡，現尙未悉。英第八軍之主要登陸地點，爲叙拉古斯灣及貼鄰克洛西角南面之奥加斯大小港，在該兩處地點，星期一復有大批軍隊上陸，並立即沿海岸向北面推進，英軍指揮之意，似着重於儘速抵達喀大尼亞平原。德軍之作戰後備軍，已在奥加斯大之西北阻遏前進之英軍，該處地區，現在發生劇戰，而叙拉古期及阿伏拉以西一帶山嶺斜坡之英第八軍中心部隊，現尙暫駐不前，但蒙甘茂萊將軍之左翼，　非常活躍，其主要之進攻方向，爲自巴齊諾經由洛索里尼（該地日被佔領）而向拉古薩，英軍並不斷增加坦克車，在該地區之中心地點作戰，英軍尙未大量使用野戰砲，但在接近海岸之地區，英艦隊之長射程大砲，可補野戰砲之不足，而在內地，則又有英空軍大隊出現，以補野戰砲之缺乏。軸心方面首當戰事之衝者，現時尙爲東南部地區之當地後備軍作戰，後備軍之大部、尙未田動作戰。傳反軸心又已在西海岸之特拉巴尼及南海岸之波多恩披枕洛爾登陸。現時尙未證實，就一般局勢而論，西西里僅爲廣大之地中海地區之一部份，反軸心軍　其海空軍之優越，得以該地區爲作戰之地帶。佔計其已在西島登陸之十師兵力，尙未達其在過去數月問集中於中東及北非之軍力半數，且反軸心軍在四西里作戰所用之軍輸船舶，尙未達其在地中海所有船舶噸數三分之二，故反軸心方面，儘可將其所有之一切用之於西西里，或則以同樣或更强之兵力，攻擊歐洲之南面側翼，總之反軸心在地中海方面無被攻之虞，故不久或將傾其集於該處之作戰潛力之全部，以大舉進攻。</p>
<p>軸心保持原有陣地</p>
<p>百倫十四日中央社電　據德國新聞社西西里特派記者柏拉納稱，西西星於星期一整日皆有激烈之戰鬥，各處之德義軍，皆保守其陣地，據云德義軍迅速反攻，殲減自該島南海岸前進之美軍大部份，美軍坦克車一隊，向山嶺間掩飾週密之軸心陣地迫進，遭德軍以攻坦克車之武器，向其側翼攻擊，美軍全被消滅，在該島東海岸之英車作戰地區，軸心軍保守陣綫，非常成功，結果英軍因傷亡嚴重，而不得不停止攻擊。據英方消息，進攻之反軸心軍，遭遇多數之最新式七五公厘大砲之猛烈抵抗，終日從兩面發砲不絕。據路透社駐美京特派員稱，昨晚華盛頓方面多傳謂，軸心方面準備以其主力軍隊之一部，加入對自蓋拉前進之美軍作戰。北非反軸心總部之消息傳謂，空軍偵察隊，曾見軸心軍隊，自西西里之內部，向南方作重要之移動。所傳軸心軍在西西里南部對美軍猛烈反攻之說，大致係指吉拉地區而言，華盛頓方面相信，此爲大戰之先兆，反攻之軍隊，德軍及義軍皆有云。德國新聞社昨晚自德軍高級指揮部獲悉，反軸心軍雖已在西島上之數處地方作勝利之反攻，但柏林方面相信，西西里之戰鬥，尙在開始階段，由於軍事上之原因，尙未能發表現階段戰鬥之詳情。但敵軍因運輸艦遭嚴重之損失，必已開始感覺供應之重大困難。德義空軍及海軍對反軸心軍船艦所施之打擊，已使英美軍之作戰，受嚴重之妨碍云。德軍方面稱，從軍事方面言之，反軸心軍之地位，殊爲不利，蓋其供應，須渡海運送而其活動之根據，又僅爲比較狹小之海岸地區。柏林方面說明，反軸心船艦損失之嚴重謂。在七月份之開始十二日內，英美共喪失船隻三十萬噸。西西里之防禦成功，蓋得力於大隊之軸心空軍，能冒極猛烈之高射砲火，向反軸心之運輪艦，作猛烈之攻擊。據云有巨型之運兵艦兩艘，共計二萬噸，星期一在西島南海岸　近遭直接擊中而沉沒。五千噸之軍火船一艘，亦被擊沉。附近尙有駁船數艘，亦被毀。另有運載軍隊及重兵器之船十一艘，共計四萬噸，亦遭直接擊中，而受重創，反軸心軍乃不得不放棄之。及有滿載之登陸船六艘，遭德戰鬥機擊中，而着火，美軍因此所受之損失，非常嚴重。</p>
<p>戰事將達加太尼亞</p>
<p>羅馬十四日中央社電　海通社訊：觀於義　利日報昨日所載關於西西里局勢之消息，可見該島第二大城加太尼亞，不久　有戰事英美軍於佔　奧格斯太軍港後，已循沿海公路進抵距離加太尼亞五十公里之地點，該城共有人口二十二萬人，不僅爲全島最重要之商業區域，且風景之美，亦冠全島，自一六九三年伊特那火同爆發，全島毀滅之後，該城即根據一種統一計劃，從事復興，土壤與建築材料多屬熔岩，是以該城之防空壕，當爲全島之最佳者云。</p>
<h3>傳艾森霍華　已返北非</h3>
<p>里斯本十四日中央社電　據阿爾及爾來訊，地中海反軸心軍總司令艾森霍華將軍，己於昨日由西西里遄返北非。</p>
<h3>東綫德軍轉取大攻勢</h3>
<p>奧勒爾·庫斯克·貝爾格洛特間中部戰區的大戰序募業已揭開。德蘇軍二百萬在庫斯克扇狀突出部分的猛烈的攻防戰，正在日趨擴大中。兩軍之人的物的動員，均極見活躍。德軍當局七日發表，奥勒爾。貝爾格洛特的戰鬥，從「反攻戰」轉入「攻勢戰」的新階段。德國新銳師團突入各地蘇聯重要戰綫，擊潰敵軍陣地數處。在反攻戰的第一天，即本月五日，德軍受蘇聯戰車羣的猛襲，但德軍覷準蘇聯戰車之技術的缺陷，巧妙地加以攻擊，瞬即殲滅一百二十輛，在第二天，德軍又增添新銳步兵援軍及新銳戰車「虎」軍，迎擊蘇聯最新的戰車羣並最强的突擊機械化部隊，一舉而深人敵陣，收獲偉大成果，擊毀戰車百九十六輛。第三日即本月七日，韓取攻勢戰的主導權，戰局遂一變而爲正式的大規模機動戰。</p>
<p>德「虎」型戰車初次出動</p>
<p>這次戰鬥不是簡單的在廣泛的戰綫上的戰鬥，東部戰綫以庫斯克爲中心，自奥勒爾至貝爾格洛特這一戰綫上，有許多處所發生個別的戰鬥，其規模及其質的激烈，堪與前二年東部戰綫上所發生的大規模攻勢相匹敵。目前戰况中最可注意者，厥爲二軍新銳戰車羣及空中戰之劇烈。蘇聯軍除美製「李將軍型」及「格蘭特將軍型」二種戰車外，並又出動了誇爲最新銳的了三四　戰車，欲衝入德軍陣地，德軍首先出動對壕兵，對戰車擲彈兵並撒去德軍前方的地雷陣地，繼用戰車部隊轉取攻勢，首决出動德國最新「虎」型戰車至東部戰綫，以其裝備及射擊力壓迫蘇聯戰車，僅六日一日，擊破蘇聯戰車一百九十六輛。</p>
<p>擊墜飛機六百卅七架</p>
<p>德國空軍不僅掩護急降轟炸機的轟炸，其驅逐機隊並興蘇聯空軍展開大空中戰、最近造成了擊　六百　七架的記錄，兩軍空軍勢力的比較，德十五蘇聯一的此例，德軍占壓倒的優勢、表示出德空軍依然如昔而軒昻的意氣。而且德軍自奧勒爾的南方及貝爾格洛特北方漸决向東進迫、正把突出於庫斯京西方的蘇聯大軍進迫至大包圍圈內。此着如能成功，則給與蘇聯之人的損失，預期將甚爲重大。</p>
<p>蘇聯全力抵禦</p>
<p>自三月廿三日以來，表面上這幾個月雖平　無事。但埋首從事戰鬥準備的兩軍、突然選擇同一地區爲主要戰塲者、其故有二：</p>
<p>（一）該區　的交通較別地便利、兩軍易於集結移動。</p>
<p>（二）貝爾格洛特奥勒爾之間的區域，可說是東部戰綫中心點的要衝。爲作戰的中樞。</p>
<p>但柏林的德軍部人士極力避免說明這戰鬥的發展性，一致主張此决戰　不是德軍所稱的夏季大攻勢、指摘蘇聯之所以宣傳此次爲德軍夏季攻勢的開始者，實爲應蔽蘇聯軍自身攻勢失敗的一種宣傳策略，並稱蘇聯必將重蹈卡科夫攻勢失敗的覆轍。事實上據前綫從軍記者的報吿，蘇聯軍在奥勒爾，貝爾格洛特附近利用集中於此方面的便利的交通綱，集結大軍百萬，傾全力構築强固的防禦陣，並欲伺機採取攻勢。而且蘇聯的防禦陣地，幾有永久陣地的模樣，進入後方的內部陣地，則漸次弱化，即此可以證明他們抱有對德採取攻勢收意圖。</p>
<p>戰局的嚴重性</p>
<p>德軍對蘇聯方面的這攻勢，毅然加以忍受者，原來德軍自對蘇開戰以來業已有了三次從「反攻」轉取「攻勢」態勢的經騐。其困難的第一次作戰，當去夏奇莫希恩哥將軍大舉在卡科夫區城開始對德攻勢時，加以反攻，並立即改取夏季大攻勢。第二次也在卡科夫區域，乘今年開始時冬季攻勢之勢，使用孟期坦因元帥的作戰中的德國優秀師團，希特勒師團，大德意志師團阻止蘇聯軍的猛烈攻勢，並從反攻轉取攻勢，確保戰略的地步。此次德軍也因爲早已知道蘇聯軍在此附近所準備的對德攻勢作戰，故而在奧勒爾，貝爾格洛特區域儘量集結了預備軍。七日夜，其發言人說：</p>
<p>「德軍以前在東部戰綫嚴守靜寂者，乃因採取誘導作戰，對蘇聯擬儘量給與較多之物的人的損失。」</p>
<p>德軍雖尙未動員戰車主力，採取眞正的攻勢，但德蘇二軍在此後必將實行莫大的人與物的動員，以擴大戰陣，而使戰鬥激烈化。這數日間的戰局，今後東部戰綫全局之動向，胥將於此覘之。故所發表的消息，極爲愼重而簡略，値得加以注意。（翔：譯自七月九日東京　　報知柏林　電）</p>

<h3>統一推進慈善事業聲中　貧病救濟協會訪問記</h3>
<p>聞關亭，林康侯，袁履登三老發表了「統一推進慈善事業的感想」一文以後，引起了社會一般人士對於上海市貧病救濟協會這個組織的注意與興趣，原來上海有這樣一個救濟和指導慈善團體和民間組織呢！爲着滿足社會上的希望，記者特別去訪問該會，把它的實際情形，紀錄出來，讓讀者看看此時此地正在嚴肅地工作着的光明的一面。</p>
<p>創辦的動機與性質</p>
<p>大陸大樓四百零二號，平凡的寫字間的下班門上，橫寫的「上海市貧病救濟協會」幾個字，告訴我已到了目的地。職員們靜肅然而緊張地工作着，幾乎誰也沒有留心一個記者的訪問。由工友帶我到「委員室」裏，一位某負責人，熱誠地和記者握手，立即率直的答覆記者！不，也正是今日社會有志人士對該會有的幾個問題</p>
<p>上海市貧病救濟協會是在去年秋天繼創立的，因爲上海市民中貧病交迫者一天增加一天，引起了有心人士的惻隱之心。誠如該會「緣起」中所說：「吾人日常所見鴿棚之戶，露宿之眾，營養不充，疾疫相逼，路斃屍體，日以十百計，而兒童屍數，往往倍於成人，尤堪警懼」，這種現象若不由較爲優裕的市民自動起來設法消弭，結果對於社會及國家前途，當有不忍設想者。因此，聞蘭亭氏等幾位熱心慈善事業的名流，邀集同志，創辦這個上海市病貧救濟協會，發起勸募貧病急救捐新幣五百萬元，就其情最慘，其事最危，其救應急，其效最大者率先協助之，主要的補助事業是（一）時疫之急救（夏令的），（二）施粥施衣之舉辦（冬令的），（三）流浪兒童之敎養（積極性的），（四）老弱殘瘦之救濟（消極性的），（五）施醫給藥等五項，至於方法，則是「就本市慈善阿體與本會宗旨相同且經辦有成績者，分別輕重緩急酌量補助」，因此該會本身並不舉辦任何慈善事業，成爲扶助慈善團體的機關了。（未完）</p>
<h3>工部局職業介紹科　辦理沉重職業登記　程度自小學至專科或大學</h3>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>事業與人才</h3>
<p>昨言中國經濟之病態，華猶有不得已於一言者，即爲中國經濟界之事業與人才。最近國內各項事業頗有　頓發展之氣象，惟最困難者，爲眞人才之缺乏，尤其適用於工農兩界之人才。求事之一方有「人浮於事」之歎，而求人之一方，反有「人才難得」之嗟。此中原因，即爲求事者，憂勝普通之人才，而事業界所欲得者，均屬專門之技術家，尤其爲適切於工農方面之專門人才。近數年來，國家多故，百端廢弛，造就人才之機關，尚未注意此點，加以交通阻隔，人才分散，以故事業界每有才難之歎。最近聞有斥責辦理農工專門學校以訓練適切於農工之專門人才爲職志者，正在集合專家，討論辦法；由此可見事業家感於人才缺乏，急圖自行訓練之一斑。惟茲事體大，經緯萬端，決非私人力量，可以勝任。希望辦學之當局，與負有重望之事業家，人人起而注意，一致從事於適應工農人才之養成，一方爲改進本業之準備，一方爲戰後生產之貢獻。同時要使許多畢業生，人人有事可爲，不致畢業於學校，失業於社會，尤其一般敎育家，應念責任之重大，速與事業家打成一片，通力進行，藉爲事業界厚植基礎，爲一般未來之工農人才，謀一正當出路。新中國工農事業之發展，其在斯乎！</p>
<h3>財糧實三部　會商統制糧食問題</h3>
<p>南京十四日中央社會電　華中物資收買配給機構係日本施行對中國新政策後，即由我國自行統制。在商統會之新機構下，推行一切事務。關於糧食收買，於此過渡階段中，則由國府糧食部直接管轄，其後因糧食部之努力結果，糧食關係同業公會組織米糧聯營社，進行甚速，故關於是否由商統會統一統制糧食問題，（決重新加以檢討。本日下午一時國府周財長，顧糧食部長，袁實業部次長，及日大使館關係人員即在周部長公館，舉行首次協讓，預料關於該問題今後將繼續舉行聯絡會議，此在促進華中物資統一統制之意義上，其成果頗堪期待。</p>
<h3>武漢物資統制會委員名單</h3>
<p>漢口十四日中央社電　物資統制審議委員會武漢分會，最近即將成立，該會使命爲統制物資抑平物價等，各項事宜，對以後本省民生之安定頗堪期待，茲錄該會各委員之名單如下：委員長湖北省長楊揆一，副委員長江西省長鄭祖禹，漢口特別市市長張仁　，委員陳維政，姚一新，榎谷顧問，小川主任參謀，落和部長，和住部長，冲野海軍武官，高津總領事，及蔡文石，孫迪堂，橋本正次部，幹事，有事振南，徐愼之，周憐鎭，山本中佐，中野少佐，遠藤連絡部第三課長，副島主計大尉松尾副領事。</p>
<h3>本市物資調委會　分三區調查</h3>
<p>物資調查委員會自成立後，即在靜安寺路馬廳內設事務所開始辦公。　於調查囤積物資工作全　，由該會調查組之中日各調查官，按定時期舉行調查官連絡會議，互相連絡交換調查工作之意見，逐步進行，經最近數次調查官連絡會議之後，已議有調查物資之具體方案，即日開始派員分頭調查，調查範圍，暫分爲第一特區，第二特區，及市區（包括南市滬西閘北浦東各地）三大區域，聞首先調查對象，爲日用呂棉紗布等主要商品，蓋因近日棉紗布高漲甚烈，其中難免不無投機囤積行爲，如查有囤積居奇責證者，決予檢舉按照囤積物品治罪條例辦理。</p>
<h3>各業評委會　展開工作</h3>
<p>本市各業公會，爲協助當局抑平物價而組織之各該業同業公會評價委員會，日來正積極展開評議調查工作。查過去工作，着重限價，致使一般奸商竟以次貨替代，冀獲非法利潤，故今後之調查工作，除限價外，尚密切注意貨品是否合乎標準，連日派遣大批調查員分赴各會員商店門市部密查，一經發覺貨物超越限價或不合標準，即予該商店以重罰。</p>
<p>標明貨價</p>
<p>各業評價委員會特通知各會員商店門市陳列商品，務須逐件標價，不得含糊。查此項措置，租界當局亦曾一再命令，蓋因商品標價，不特便利顧客，且使調查工作易於進行</p>
<p>不得拒售</p>
<p>各商店近來時有藏貨拒售情事，無異變相囤積。各評價委員會對此亦予重視，派員密切調查，如果有以上情形，則呈報公會核辦</p>
<h3>銀行公會新任　理監事就職</h3>
<p>本市銀行公會自上月廿六日召開會員代表大會，邇定第十四屆　監事後，一切會務在新任　監事未就職前，仍由前任執行委員會暫代處理，現憑該會於日昨曾開新任理監事聯席會議，奉行就職典禮，並推選　扶霄爲理事長，吳震修　廳民朱如棠朱博素爲常務理事，第一次常務理事會議，及每月會議次數日期　，現尚未經決定云。</p>
<h3>證券交易所　八月中復業</h3>
<p>停業已久之上海華商證券交易所，自經財實兩部令飭籌備復業後，現由中國邇商銀行董事長兼前證券交易所董事長張慰如負責積極籌備中，該所已決定於本月二十四日下午二時在香港路銀行俱樂部舉行股東會議，講座整理經紀人數額及增加資本額，大致除原有經紀人數八十家外，再增加華股三十五家，外股四十二家，另有經紀人四十三家，共計二百家，資本額由原有舊幣一百二十萬元，增爲國幣二千萬元，一部份由舊股認定，一部份另招新股，預定於八月中旬復業開拍交易，其交易則以華股爲主體，惟爲杜絕投機流幣起見，均限以現貨交易爲原則云。</p>
<h3>華股趨勢</h3>
<p>昨華股先猛跌，後忽胖熊踊，某幫大起活動，求現賣戶全被收吸，至十點半後，新老各股呈有求無供狀態。百貨業之新新公司一度退入關內，後回出飛躍逾上日之高峰，永安與國貨公司回挫後步升，後者大關在望，內衣與景福景綸兩衫橫漲度日巨。紡織業之永安紡織上升百數，榮豐紡織及大生一三兩廠，小票面之新豐印染·美綸毛絨·國信染織·信和紗廠等均在向新高價挺進中。文化業之商務·中華·世界三書局進價意外抬上。南洋　草大中華火柴及公用業之閘北水電與華商電氣售出者絕跡。新藥業民誼·中西·明星香水趨堅。大中華實業久安實業成交均旺，價見躍升。新益地產堅挺，新亞建業挺勁。</p>
<h3>行荘緊縮放款　銀根趨緊　拆息開二角四</h3>
<p>滬市各業市况，因受流言之煽惑，稍見趨緊，粭赤暗市雖喊叫高價，但格於當局禁止，迄我正式成交者，銀樓業藉口無現貨，兩日來均無兌出交易，門售手續費無法提高，是以寗願不做買賣，投機粭赤，市檜亦因無從購進現貨，均呈觀望不前之勢。軍票聯票尚無多大出入。股票及紗布市價略見提升。各金融機關之行荘爲雷傲杜絕投機，抑止物價漲風起見，均緊縮放款業務。是以市價銀荘趨緊，錢業拆息昨（十四日）日提升二分爲二角四分。整個金融狀况，在中儲儘量踴劑之下，依然穩定。近兩日市情，表面雖似緊張，實際金融鞏固異常云。</p>
<h3>花生芝蔴　本年收買量</h3>
<p>茲據油糧專業委員會估計，本年度花生預定收買數量，計崇明區五千担，浦東區二萬担，皖北區二萬担，揚州泰東區二萬担，共为六萬五千担。又芝蔴預定收買量，崇明區七千担，武宜丹金錫澄蘇吳區二萬担，南京鎭江區二萬担，蕪湖區一萬担，安慶區一萬担，皖北區十五萬担至十萬担，共爲廿六萬七千担至廿一萬七千担。</p>
<h3>商情摘要</h3>
<p>金銀　銀樓飾金門市仍照限價兌出，手續費仍舊，但無貨應市。業內外做價又見軋升，銀價亦漲。</p>
<p>公債　公債平疲，甲乙丙戊四種均見軋低，惟丁種獨升，交易不旺。</p>
<p>棉布　行市岑寂異常，各方供求銳减，惟人心挺秀，盤旋上漲。龍頭細布　前日見軋高，四君子嗶嘰亦略大，三羊嗶嘰上升尤勁，桃花女士林現貨漲熱亦烈，但成交淸稀。</p>

<h3>挽回世風</h3>
<p>— 枕琱戈</p>
<p>現在社區會、有很多人感到「人情本薄」，　以又注意起中國的古文學來了，於是有很多人仕在刻格言，印家訓之類，廣贈親友，目的當然是「願後之覽者」：這種舉動和見解的確値得贊同，値得謳歌的；但是其效果、我覺到很懷疑。</p>
<p>人欲爲「君子」「聖哲」，就須要修養，要修養，雖不一定「行萬里路，讀萬卷書」，至少亦得知道點爲人之道，修養之方，那最好是格言家訓之類了，因爲這些都是古人「生平親歷之艱難險惡，與夫省察克治之心得」，而且句短易記，但是我以爲格言抄的書本上，家訓印在書本上，甚而至於一切日常用具上都記得着「器物銘」之類，而不能實踐，還是沒有用，還是不能「挽回世風」的。在另一面來說，雖沒有什麼格言集家訓篇，但各人有一國句自以爲最有用的格言佳名，銘記在心，時時奉行，時時反省，刻刻自成，這樣或許還可以有效果的。</p>
<p>所以，自以爲格言是須要的，但是它是要你知而即行，切切實實地行的，決不是抄一些佳言、印一些家訓就可以「換回世風」的。</p>
<h3>京戲與電影</h3>
<p>— 言慧珠</p>
<p>有人常常問我：「唱京戲與拍電影」的滋味如何？我的回答是：兩者同是藝術，雖然意義是一樣的，可是表現藝術的方法卻不同樣所以滋味也就兩樣了。</p>
<p>京戲有固定的台本，唱來唱去總是那麼幾齣，電影雖然也有劇本，每天拍的完全兩樣，唱京戲在台上距離觀眾遠，唱起來很方便，拍電影雖沒有觀眾，但是攝影場有很多的工作人員，要是拍一個近景，距離攝影機很近，要做各種不同的表情，笑啊，哭啊，講話啦以及其他什麼動作啦，真是很難得，唱京戲不可唱錯詞句，否則，台下便要喝倒采，拍電影沒有關係，說錯了重拍一個就好了。還有唱京戲，好壞自己看不出，聲調身段好何，一定要旁觀者批評；電影就不同，拍完了放映的時候，自己可以看自己的戲，好壞是一見分曉。</p>
<p>由此，便可以看出，京戲與電影表現藝術的不同點了，這是我個人拍「逃婚」影片時的感覺。</p>

<h3>親恩</h3>
<p>— 弘農</p>
<p>謂人不知父母恩，何當患難則呼親？謂人皆知父母恩：何當安樂則弘農　忘親？謂人不知事親道，何當敎子皆事孝？謂人皆知事親道，何當爲子鮮能孝？</p>
<p>發已落齒已搖，試思親爲何人老？喘而臥呈而行，試恩親爲何人病？衣不忍求美，食不忍求精，試恩親爲何人省？</p>
<p>媳雖健不能勤，愛媳皆由愛子心，孫在抱不敢驚，痛孫又甚痛見情。兒出門　諄諄，枕上常飛　裡魂，兒有疾心戚戚，眼中不斷千行泣。兒有過口不言，人或談必代掩，命臨危目不瞑，兒在側猶轉睛。少至壯壯至老，拳拳愛子心，至死還未了。</p>
<p>試問爲子者，能否穷竟曉？雛鴉知反哺，羔美和跪乳？禽獸如此，人子何不悟？勿謂事多忽，請待閒時補？勿謂力不能，請待有時行？只恐子待親不待，風木與悲徒淚零！</p>
<h3>鷄</h3>
<p>— 沈沈</p>
<p>李陸兩人不約而同的兩眼釘住張參謀，點點頭無話可說。大家心裡想着，这究竟算怎麼一囘鬼把戲！正在出神，門口一陣脚步聲，走進兩個灰衣帶平項帽的人，挾著一個形容憔悴　阿坤，垂著頭不作聲，李鎭長立刻跑過去說。</p>
<p>「阿坤！我們一起回去罷！」阿坤還不知怎樣的把自己發落，所以呆木地任憑擺布，忽然聽得招呼自己的是聲氣很熟的李鎭長，才抬起頭來，露出微弱無力的眼光，一邊看看旁邊站著的穿灰布衣的，嗚咽得說不出話來，微點着頭。</p>
<p>「你們一起回去吧！沒有事了！」張參謀向李鎭長說着，並揮手向旁邊兩個灰布衣的呌他們退去，李鎭長攬著阿坤說：</p>
<p>「走吧！時候不早了！」</p>
<p>「謝謝張參謀！明天我們在鎭東吳家茶舘裡喝茶，談談。李鎭長一邊向張參謀打着招呼，一邊走出六去：</p>
<p>「好的！明天再談。」再見吧！張參謀說着，便送出外邊門口，過去就是街道。</p>
<p>「再見！再見！」李鎭長打着招呼，三個人一逕向西走去，不數步李鎭長已經到了自家的門口，一面敲門，一面說道：</p>
<p>「阿坤！你不要傷心，回去休息，今晚能夠在家裡過夜，已經算大大的幸運了。要知道你命中注定，合該有事，這年頭閉門家中坐，禍從大上來的事多哩！有什麼話說呢？君強—陸甲長的名—你由早點安息，很累了！」說完進門去了。阿坤點點頭，陸甲長也先回自己家裡。阿坤提着沉重的步伐，九月下旬的殘月，懸臨半空，時候已經不早望著息家古舊的柴扉，從縫隙裡露出點微的燈光，知道妻還在守着。一陣嚎—嚎—嚎的犬吠聲，月色中自己豢養的狗，認不出主人的面貌，而奔逐狂吠，迫近了線發覺是自己的主人，頓時搖尾跳躍的向主人表示親暱歡迎，眼裡看得出他的主人，心靈上已經受了巨大的創傷呢？阿坤自然也鼓不起興緻，逗玩小犬，默然前。可是那天眞的小犬，倒並不勢利一直隨護主人，走去。（十一）</p>

<h3>Request for Further Donations to the Scholarship Fund Campaign</h3>
<p>Not long ago, this city launched a North China disaster relief effort and achieved excellent results in a very short period. This fully demonstrated that the citizens of Shanghai are eager for public service and unwilling to lag behind the rest of the country, and are worthy of being a national model. Now, we are conducting a scholarship fund campaign that is even more proactive than disaster relief. The success or failure of this campaign directly affects the future of out-of-school youth in this city and indirectly affects the future talent pool of the entire country. Therefore, we once again make a special appeal to all sectors of society, hoping that everyone will continue to contribute generously out of their eagerness for public service, so that this scholarship fund campaign will achieve unprecedented success.</p>
<p>At present and in the future, the most important issue for China's revival is the issue of talent. No one can deny this. When we ask every enthusiastic person engaged in the revival and construction of the country and society, they all sigh in unison that there is a severe lack of talent at present! Many undertakings and many plans cannot be carried out not because of a lack of funds, but because of a lack of real talent. To put it bluntly, judging from the feelings of ordinary entrepreneurs in Shanghai today, all those who truly develop their careers also feel that talent is the most important issue. The reason for the current lack of talent is naturally because the work of cultivating talent five or ten years ago was not carried out adequately. However, if we compare the current schools for cultivating talent and the number of students with the situation five or ten years ago, then we cannot but admit that, in any case, the situation five or ten years ago was much better than it is now. Not to mention middle schools and elementary schools, but even in terms of specialized schools and universities, the number of schools and students at that time was several times higher than it is today. When we flip through old newspapers from a few years ago, the enrollment advertisements during summer and winter vacations are more numerous than they are now, and the number of students in each school is generally several times higher than that of today's general large, medium, and small schools. With so many schools and students in those years, it still led to a lack of talent. When we think about the issue of China's revival and construction and talent five or ten years from now, given the scarcity of schools and students today, anyone with a heart cannot help but feel disheartened!</p>
<p>For the sake of the future revival and construction of society and the country, we must step up the cultivation of talent today. However, in reality, taking Shanghai, the most culturally developed city in the country, as an example, there is a serious and widespread phenomenon of out-of-school youth. The reason for this phenomenon is, of course, that the work of restoring schools at all levels after the Incident has not yet reached an ideal level, resulting in a sense of insufficient schools, as well as a lack of specialized teachers and material facilities, so that the content of general schools has not been enriched. However, the most serious and widespread reason at present is that the children of ordinary families below the middle class, the children of ordinary civil servants, and even the children of teachers in various schools are all in a state of being unable to afford schooling. Even providing elementary school expenses is already very difficult. Therefore, we often hear the sigh, "Those who teach other people's children have no one to teach their own children." Similarly, ordinary middle- and high-ranking civil servants also rarely have the ability to maintain their children's middle school expenses. As for the expenses of universities and specialized schools, they are definitely beyond the reach of families below the middle class, and they have become institutions of learning only for a small number of wealthy children. Regardless of the content and educational outcomes of such schools for wealthy children, such a small number of students, even if everyone becomes a specialist in the future, will definitely not be enough to meet the needs of the country and society! Therefore, at present, assisting out-of-school youth who are unable to afford schooling, so that they are no longer barred from the doors of schools, and cultivating a large number of talents in the future is of the utmost importance, whether from a social perspective or from the perspective of national interests.</p>
<p>The target for the scholarship fund raised by this newspaper's current scholarship fund campaign is tentatively set at 1.5 million yuan. In today's Shanghai, this figure is not a staggering amount. However, if it can be successfully completed within one month, it can assist 1,500 elementary school students (250 yuan per student, totaling 375,000 yuan), 1,000 junior high school students (350 yuan per student, totaling 350,000 yuan), 1,000 senior high school students (450 yuan per student, totaling 450,000 yuan), 500 university or vocational school students (550 yuan per student, totaling 275,000 yuan), and 250 vocational school students (200 yuan per student, totaling 50,000 yuan) so that they can continue their studies for this semester. In other words, this 1.5 million yuan can prevent 4,250 young people from dropping out of school during this semester. Given the large population of this city and the large number of enthusiastic people in this city, throwing whips can stop the flow of a river, and accumulating gold can build a tower. If those who are rich and benevolent come forward to set an example and continue their efforts, the expected target will not be difficult to reach in the shortest possible time. Yesterday, we received a generous donation of 100,000 yuan from Mr. Sheng You'an. His enthusiasm and righteous act are indeed admirable, and his earnest concern for benefiting the poor and talented is particularly commendable for his far-sightedness and his loyalty to cultivating talent for society and the country! We, on behalf of the young people who receive scholarships, would like to express our respect to Mr. Sheng. We firmly believe that Shanghai is not lacking in people with the same outstanding vision and enthusiasm as Mr. Sheng. If they can avoid letting Mr. Sheng have the exclusive beauty in front, and donate enthusiastically, then only fifteen people like Mr. Sheng are needed to fully achieve this goal! Of course, we still sincerely welcome small donors. We hope that insightful wealthy people will regard participating in the scholarship fund campaign as a supreme honor, and regard donating money to support education as a glorious obligation for citizens of the new era towards the future revival of society and the construction of the country. We hope that the list of donors published every day will become ironclad proof of the Chinese nation's unyielding self-improvement, and use this list to inspire the movement for the revival of national culture.</p>
<p>In the North China disaster relief donation drive, citizens and organizations from all walks of life in Shanghai have won a glorious championship. We eagerly look forward to demonstrating the superior character of the Chinese nation's eagerness for public service in this scholarship fund campaign as well! On behalf of millions of out-of-school youth, on behalf of the society and country in urgent need of talent, we sincerely appeal to insightful wealthy people in this city!</p>

<h3>The Fourth Central Cooperation Conference Held. Prime Minister Tojo Delivers Speech. Increasingly Confident in the Understanding of the True Intentions of Japan by Various Ethnic Groups in East Asia. Confident in the Prospect of Victory in the War.</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) The Fourth Central Cooperation Conference was held at the Greater East Asia Hall on the morning of the 14th at 9:00 AM. Japanese Prime Minister and President of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, Tojo, first stated his experiences during his visit to the South and his confidence in victory. He said that he had previously visited the Republic of China, Manchuria, and the Philippines, and this time he visited Thailand and various places in the South. He witnessed the understanding of Japan's true intentions by various countries and ethnic groups in Greater East Asia, and the concentration of the total strength of one billion people on the path of defeating Britain and the United States. This is the realization of comprehensive cooperation with Japan. He also witnessed the gradual transformation of huge national defense resources into combat power. His belief in Japan's victory in the Greater East Asia War has become stronger. At this moment, Japan will not hesitate to provide the greatest assistance and cooperation to these countries and ethnic groups. Therefore, concrete measures are gradually being taken. The victorious posture of the Greater East Asia War and the foundation for the construction of a new order in Greater East Asia are so solid that it is truly gratifying. Regarding Europe, our country and our allies such as Germany and Italy are increasingly consolidating their unity and advancing together on the path to defeating Britain and the United States, which is also extremely gratifying. Because of the war of justice and because of the unity of East Asia, our victory is unwavering. However, the acquisition of this victory still depends on the extraordinary efforts and sacrifices of our one hundred million people. The enemy, Britain and the United States, are now carrying out counterattacks with their reliance on material resources, and their momentum should not be underestimated. However, this is also known to our country, so there is nothing to fear. Because under this certain-to-win situation, we can only raise our fighting spirit, display an indomitable spirit, and move forward to the final victory of the Greater East Asia War in a dignified manner. Finally, the Prime Minister also hoped that the national people would rise up together to gather the total national strength and enhance combat power, meaning that the government had previously convened a temporary parliament to discuss and prepare for emergency increases in corporate food production and other issues. This is to strive to enhance combat power. However, in order to enhance combat power by using the total strength of the country, every citizen must stand up with the spirit of sacrificing oneself for the country and fight for the country. Therefore, I sincerely hope that our one hundred million people will share joys and sorrows and work together to develop each person's ability. We should also step up efforts to refresh our lives, save on consumption, increase savings, and not be moved by any situation. Furthermore, we should thoroughly practice a clean and simple life with a robust spirit to contribute to the country. At this serious moment, we will demonstrate the traditional spirit of our one hundred million people, so as to glorify the country and determine the fate of East Asia for a thousand years. This is our important responsibility. The country expects and desires that military officers and civilians unite in one heart and devote all their efforts to developing the performance of our nation. This is also the only way to support the holy cause and glorify the country. The purpose of convening the Fourth Central Cooperation Conference is also for this reason. With the full enthusiasm of the national people, their confidence in the enhancement of combat power will definitely make a great contribution.</p>
<p>Suzuki Reports on Corporate Policy</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) Mr. Suzuki, President of the Japanese Planning Board, spoke at the plenary session of the Japanese Central Cooperation Conference on the 14th regarding the special law for enhancing combat power and preparing enterprises passed by the 82nd Temporary Parliament of Japan and its implementation policy. He requested the cooperation of both government and private sectors to carry out rapid and smooth preparations to meet the urgent needs of the war situation. The main points of President Suzuki's speech are recorded below. The production situation is an important factor in combat power, and it has been progressing very smoothly since the second half of last year. In particular, in the first half of this year, unprecedentedly good results have been achieved. The achievements of important industrial production are very beautiful. At the current stage, to break through the urgent war situation, we can only win with the strong force of the people. Therefore, we must enhance combat power, and if we do not immediately develop the total force of the people, we will not be able to achieve the urgent goals, because of the increase in aircraft, ships, and personnel. However, we must remember that the foundation is extremely broad. The previous enterprise preparations were often difficult due to the relationship of the controlled economy, and had to be changed to be spontaneous, self-defense, and have a passive character. However, this time, the enterprise preparations are for the purpose of turning it into combat power. We are preparing to launch a part of the strong power of the law, and the preparation policy is to prepare those that are easy to start and turn into combat power first, regardless of the excellence or corruption of their business. This is the electrical key's characteristics. The implementation method is to turn tens of thousands of labor force into combat power, and steel will also be able to be appropriated by tens of thousands of tons. Due to the impact of the above-mentioned enterprise preparations on the economic order, it is also very large. In terms of funds, tens of billions of yuan in cash will also be spent. The government is implementing various policies to handle these situations, seeking to keep good methods to maintain economic order and strengthen economic power. Now we must thoroughly recognize the demands of the war on us and the appearance of the war. We must stand on the traditional spirit of not fearing any difficulties in wartime in order to seek a living.</p>
<p>Amau Director-General Vigorously Criticizes Britain and the United States</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) Mr. Amau, Director-General of the Japanese Information Bureau, delivered a speech on the recent general international situation at the Fourth Central Cooperation Conference. The general idea was that Britain and the United States provoked this war to destroy Japan. Democracy is the slogan flaunted by Britain and the United States. Their democracy is nothing more than the democracy of the British and Americans or the nationalism of the purely Anglo-Saxon nation. Today, a part of the nation, regardless of whether they are British or American citizens, absolutely do not recognize their freedom and equality. This matter is already known to the world. They regard the Asian nation as a different race and have no expectations other than to satisfy their material needs. Since Japan first awakened, the Asian nations have also awakened one after another. Today, the atmosphere of liberating all of Asia is high, and leaders who resist Britain and the United States and fight for independence are rising at any time. Burmese Governor Bamo is now fighting for the independence of Burma. Filipino Independence Preparatory Committee Chairman Laurel and Vargas, Roxas, and other patriots are also working with the enthusiasm of comrades for the independence of the Philippines. In addition, Indian Chandra Bose previously expressed his aspirations for independence in Tung. In his speech, he said that India has now seen the dawn of freedom. Such a good opportunity will not reappear in the next hundred years. After Contractor Bose arrived in Zhao Nan, he has announced his ambitious plan to organize a provisional government of free India. The British Cone has appointed Wavell as the new Governor-General of India and implemented military oppression politics, but the final victory will be for oppression or independence, and there is a certain trend. However, we already deeply know that the final victory belongs to justice. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Premier of the Kuomintang, who prompted the awakening of the neighboring Republic of China, said when the Guangdong government was established in February of the 12th year of Taisho, "Japanese and Chinese are both Asians." Therefore, even if Japan and China are at war, it is only a dispute between brothers and will not harm the brotherhood. If we leave our country and go to Canada, the United States, and south to Australia and New Zealand, and west to South Africa, we will feel that Chinese and Japanese are indistinguishable. But it is also precisely because of this that we are both rejected from entering. On the contrary, the British and Americans have invaded Asia, such as China, which is no different from a British and American colony, and the Chinese are no different from their slaves. In order to build Asia for Asians, we cannot but fight together. Looking at the current situation, it is true. The attitude of Britain and the United States has not changed at all. The Atlantic Charter once declared respect for the national spirit, but its deception is now proven by facts. Britain and the United States have not been threatened by other countries at all. Why are they willing to engage in war? The British and Americans monopolize the world's resources and can live comfortably. Why is there a need for war? This should be the question of ordinary Americans and also the question of the world. The facts indicate that Britain and the United States want to destroy Japan, destroy China, oppress Thailand, the Philippines, Burma, and India, and make Asians slaves forever, and use war to satisfy their ambition to invade the world and complete their hegemony of the world. The war is also the rise of Asians to break the shackles of Britain and the United States and build a world of truth, goodness, and beauty. The dawn of Asian liberation has now arrived. The fate of the Asian world, the liberation of Asia, the world of righteousness, and the life and death of Japan are completely in this battle. Therefore, this war is a war to determine the universe and create a new era.</p>
<h3>Japanese Economic Mission Departs Beijing Today to Shanghai. Chinese and Japanese Officials Hold Farewell Banquet.</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) The Japanese Economic Mission has been in Beijing for three days, and has had sincere talks and exchanges of views with all levels of the Chinese government and the public, with very satisfactory results. It is learned that the mission's task in Beijing has been completed and is scheduled to leave Beijing for Shanghai on the morning of the 15th, and then return to their country.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) Mr. Ishiwatari Shotaro, the highest economic advisor of the National Government, held a tea party at his official residence at 4:00 PM on the 14th to entertain the Japanese Economic Mission. General Hata, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Dispatch Army in China, also held a banquet for the mission at 7:00 PM on the same evening.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) The Japanese Economic Mission has been in Beijing for two days. The 14th was the third day. At 8:00 AM, the mission went to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum to pay their respects to the tomb of the Father of the Nation. At noon, they visited Foreign Minister Chu to have sincere talks. Foreign Minister Chu hosted a banquet at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association. During the banquet, Foreign Minister Chu and the head of the mission, Ogura, gave sincere speeches, and the atmosphere was very harmonious.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) To welcome the arrival of the Japanese Economic Mission in Beijing, the Central News Agency, together with the Japanese Domei News Agency and the capital's newspapers, held an economic and cultural symposium at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association at 3:00 PM on the 14th. The symposium began at 3:30 PM and lasted for more than an hour. The overall results of the symposium can be summarized in the following four points: (1) The current economic situation in China is still good, and the only difficulty is the currency issue. There are two ways to remedy this: (A) Start with guiding the national psychology, especially to enhance the public's awareness of economic construction; (B) To make the materials have a reasonable unity, so as not to be scattered, so as to avoid the occurrence of bad phenomena. (2) Regarding the issue of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, the most important thing is that economic circles in both countries must have a deep understanding of each other in terms of psychology and spirit. There should be more exchanges and contacts with each other to eliminate past barriers, and then cooperation can be smoothly successful. (3) Regarding the currency issue, the current issue of currency unification in China is completely different from the unification of the old legal currency in the 24th year of the Republic of China. At that time, it was not the government unifying the currency, but the extension of the effectiveness of British and American currencies. Now, the government and the people are closely linked, and it is predicted that the unification of the currency of the entire China can be successfully realized. (4) Regarding the issue of development, the development of the South is absolutely optimistic. At present, except for the transportation problem which is more difficult, everything else is quite satisfactory. The production mechanism has been fully restored, and all materials are more abundant than before. For example, rice and rubber are showing signs of excess. Since Britain and the United States lost Nanyang, they have had great difficulties in all materials, especially the rubber item is even more lacking. Therefore, the economic power of Britain and the United States does not need to be cared about, but it cannot be ignored. In the future, as long as the people of China and Japan work closely together, the construction of the Co-prosperity Sphere can be completed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Results in Eastern Hebei</h3>
<p>Tianjin, 14th (Central News Agency) The Japanese troops in the eastern Hebei and Jin Hai areas and the various armed forces of the National Government have recently cooperated to suppress the Chongqing Communist troops. In June, a total of 20 battles were fought with the Chongqing Communist troops, destroying 7 facilities of the Chongqing Communist troops, leaving 259 corpses of the Chongqing Communist troops, and capturing 156 people. The Japanese army intercepted a large number of rifles, pistols, automatic rifles, artillery shells, ammunition, and other military equipment and clothing.</p>

<h3>Wang Kemin Arrived in Nanjing Yesterday to Report on the Process of Taking Office and to Seek Instructions on Administrative Policies</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) Wang Kemin, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, reported to Chairman Wang on the process of taking office and sought instructions on future administrative policies in North China. He took a plane from Qingdao on the afternoon of the 14th with Shao Donghu, a counselor of the Commission, and flew to Nanjing at 5:15 PM.</p>
<p>Qingdao, 14th (Central News Agency) Wang Kemin, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, arrived in Qingdao by plane on the 12th and returned to his private residence to rest. On the 13th, he met with a group of reporters and expressed his firm beliefs regarding the most important issue of grain in North China and other points. The general idea was that the successive deaths of Yin Tong and Zhu Shen were not only a great loss to him personally, but also to the country. On the 3rd of this month, he received an urgent telegram from Chairman Wang and immediately rushed to the capital. At that time, due to the large number of government affairs, he could not ask for detailed instructions, so he planned to visit again another day, so he hurriedly went to Beijing to take office. He and former Chairman Zhu had a close personal friendship and often exchanged opinions and consulted each other. Therefore, he intends to follow the example of former Chairman Zhu and strengthen his policies. The most urgent issue to be resolved at the moment is the grain issue. Regarding this point, the Materials and Price Handling Committee is actively preparing countermeasures as the center, especially the Standing Committee members, Shi Jing, and Wang Yintai, who are the most involved. Director Wang is currently focusing on regulating funds, while Director Wang is focusing on political negotiations. Therefore, he believes that the fundamental policy for solving the grain problem has long been decided by the authorities and is being actively implemented. Although it has not yet reached the stage of publication, it can often be seen in the facts within days.</p>

<h3>Many Indian Defense Soldiers Deserting</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 14th (Central News Agency) According to a New Delhi telegram, the number of desertions of Indian soldiers in the Indian Defense Forces has recently increased sharply. Although the authorities have been seriously monitoring, there are still groups attempting to escape by force. Therefore, the number of soldiers feels insufficient, and the Indian Governor's Office is also very embarrassed. It has issued a proclamation to various states, saying that it will improve the treatment of Indian soldiers in the future and order the rapid replenishment of insufficient soldiers. According to the analysis, the mass desertion of Indian soldiers is due to dissatisfaction with the treatment of the British, and the strong independent air inside and outside India and the increasingly fierce anti-British sentiment are one of the reasons. However, the results of the countermeasures taken by the British authorities are still quite questionable.</p>
<h3>Grew Again Warns the Americans: Do Not Underestimate Japan's Strength</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, July 14th. According to a New York dispatch, former U.S. Ambassador to Japan, now State Department Advisor Grew, gave a speech yesterday at Columbia University. He warned the American people not to underestimate Japan's strength, stating that in the vast areas occupied by Japan in East Asia, Japan obtained four extremely important factors for its war effort: namely (1) raw materials, (2) a great reserve of labor, (3) factories, and (4) shipbuilding equipment. Grew spoke in a serious tone, saying that in the war between the United States and Japan, a great deal of blood, sweat, and tears would likely be sacrificed. We should not completely rely on the soldiers fighting on the front lines, but must rely on all the people of the nation, he said.</p>
<h3>Naval Air Force Deals Heavy Blow to U.S. Forces on Rendova Island; Eleven Enemy Aircraft Shot Down</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shonan, July 14th. According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese military base on the 14th, after U.S. forces landed on Rendova Island on June 30th, they subsequently landed on the southeastern and northwestern shores of New Georgia Island, attempting to seize the Japanese positions on the island. Although they repeatedly suffered heavy blows from Japanese air forces and destroyer fleets, they relied on their numbers and continued to intrude into the island. The Japanese naval air force, on the 12th and 13th of July, again attacked the enemy landing points on the northwestern shore of the island with fighter squadrons, engaging sixty enemy fighters in aerial combat. After shooting down eleven enemy aircraft, they returned to their base.</p>

<h3>One Hundred British Aircraft Intrude into Swiss Territory</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Zurich, July 14th. The Swiss government issued a communiqué on the 13th stating that the British Air Force, between 00:04 and 00:51 on the morning of the 13th, intruded into Swiss airspace with a large formation of one hundred aircraft and bombed Richigen-Kiesbersi in Bern and Flamatt-Oberland in Fribourg. All locations sustained considerable damage. At the time, one British aircraft crashed near Buberei against Mount Guramont, and the remains of five pilots have been found, while two others are missing. Furthermore, the bombs dropped by British aircraft near Flamatt destroyed an area within a radius of eighty meters. A house near Richigen-Kiesbersi was completely destroyed, and another was damaged.</p>
<h3>Soviet Offensive Plan Fails; German Forces Advance Victoriously; Two Large Soviet Tank Formations East and Northeast of Belgorod Destroyed by Germans</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, July 14th. Colonel Hammar, a military correspondent for the German News Agency, announced that the attrition of Soviet forces continues. On Sunday, another 407 Soviet tanks were destroyed in the two major battle zones north and south of Kursk. The German counter-offensive is intensifying, mopping up the remnants of Soviet forces and repelling their reserves. Because the Soviet forces attempted to relieve the encircled areas, the battle zone greatly expanded, and the opened gap has stretched to about 250 kilometers. The Soviet Union's original offensive plan has not only been thwarted by the German forces, but the German counter-offensive has forced the Soviet army to sacrifice a large number of troops. On Sunday, the number of Soviet reserve troops surrendering was countless. As a result of the battle north of Belgorod on Sunday, the German army has extended its bridgehead east of the entire Donets River and outside the Psel River, cutting off the connection between two large Soviet tank formations and at least six Soviet divisions. South of Orel, the positions of important German strongholds have also advanced. Although Soviet resistance is strong, it ultimately cannot stop the organized actions of the German forces. The Soviet Union used entire divisions to resist the advance of the German spearhead units and used multiple tank regiments to defend against the German flank attacks. These concentrated Soviet tank formations were blocked by German Tiger tanks, anti-aircraft guns, and flat-trajectory guns. To the east and northwest of Belgorod, two large Soviet tank formations were destroyed, with tank losses amounting to no fewer than 336 vehicles. In addition, 70 Soviet tanks were destroyed in the south of Orel and north of the front-line bend during the Soviet relief operations. The Soviet army was greatly defeated there. At the same time, in these tank battles, aerial attacks on Soviet concentrations were particularly effective. Dive bombers and tank-busting bombers repeatedly attacked Soviet tank concentrations and their movements, either defeating them or destroying them. Soviet grenadiers never advanced after the tanks were destroyed. At the same time, German fighters once again maintained their air superiority, with no fewer than 103 Soviet aircraft shot down, including 27 shot down by German anti-aircraft guns.</p>
<h3>Two Military Commanders Replaced in Spain</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Madrid, July 14th. According to an announcement published in yesterday's official gazette, the Spanish government has ordered the replacement of the Western Army commander on the Atlantic coast and the Canary Islands.

<h3>Australian Foreign Minister Arrives in the United States</h3>

<h3>U.S. Senator Hopes to Repeal the Chinese Exclusion Act</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, July 14th. According to Washington, the bill to repeal the U.S. Chinese Exclusion Act was shelved in the Senate Naturalization Committee last month. Now, Representative Studer, when meeting with a United Press reporter on the 13th, believes that repealing the Exclusion Act is the best way to buy the greatest friendship from Chongqing. He also said that Americans should consider that this is in their own best interests, and that by repealing the Act, the United States can obtain Chongqing's assistance in the war against Japan. Therefore, he hopes to pass the Act before this autumn. From this, we can see that the so-called humanitarianism of the United States is based on seeking its own interests, and how deeply rooted the concept of racial inequality is can be imagined.</p>

<h3>Battles Intensify in Southeastern Sicily; British Advance Halted Before Most German Forces Deployed</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, July 14th. Captain Setorius, a military correspondent for the Transocean News Agency, stated that the Anti-Axis forces, taking advantage of their air and naval superiority, landed a large number of fresh troops (at least two to three divisions) in southeastern Sicily on Sunday night. Most of these fresh troops joined the U.S. Seventh Army, so that General Patton could not only defend the bridgeheads established at Licata and Gela after the initial landing, but also expand these bridgeheads. On the Licata bridgehead front, Canadian troops, operating under the command of U.S. commanders, have advanced twelve kilometers to the west and north. Whether Patton's right flank has advanced from Gela to the east and southeast to a certain extent and can maintain continuous contact with General Montgomery's left flank operating in the Pozzallo to Rosolini area is still unknown. The main landing points for the British Eighth Army were Syracuse Bay and the small ports of Augusta, adjacent to the south of Cape Crosi. On Monday, a large number of troops landed at these two locations and immediately advanced north along the coast. The intention of the British command seems to be focused on reaching the Catania Plain as quickly as possible. The German operational reserves have blocked the advancing British forces northwest of Augusta, where fierce fighting is now taking place. The central part of the British Eighth Army on the slopes of the mountains west of Syracuse and Avola is currently holding its position temporarily, but General Montgomery's left flank is very active. Its main direction of attack is from Pachino via Rosolini (which was occupied by the British) towards Ragusa. The British are constantly increasing the number of tanks operating in the central area. The British have not used field artillery on a large scale, but in areas close to the coast, the long-range guns of the British fleet can compensate for the lack of field artillery. In the interior, large formations of the British Air Force have appeared to compensate for the lack of field artillery. The Axis forces facing the brunt of the fighting are currently local reserve forces operating in the southeastern area. Most of the reserve forces have not yet been deployed. It is rumored that the Anti-Axis forces have also landed at Trapani on the west coast and Porto Empedocle on the south coast. This has not yet been confirmed. In general, Sicily is only part of the vast Mediterranean area, and the Anti-Axis forces, with their naval and air superiority, are able to use this area as a theater of operations. It is estimated that the ten divisions they have landed on Sicily have not reached half of the military strength they have concentrated in the Middle East and North Africa in the past few months. Moreover, the troop transport ships used by the Anti-Axis forces in Sicily have not reached two-thirds of the tonnage of all their ships in the Mediterranean. Therefore, the Anti-Axis forces can either use all of their forces in Sicily, or attack the southern flank of Europe with the same or greater force. In short, the Anti-Axis forces are not threatened in the Mediterranean, so they may soon unleash all of their concentrated operational potential to launch a major offensive.</p>
<p>Axis Forces Maintain Original Positions</p>
<p>Central News Agency, London, July 14th. According to Berlana, a Sicily special correspondent for the German News Agency, there was fierce fighting throughout Sicily on Monday. German and Italian forces everywhere maintained their positions. It is said that the German and Italian forces launched a swift counterattack, wiping out a large part of the U.S. forces advancing from the southern coast of the island. A U.S. tank formation approached the carefully concealed Axis positions in the mountains and was attacked on its flanks by German anti-tank weapons, resulting in the complete annihilation of the U.S. forces. In the area of British tank operations on the east coast of the island, the Axis forces maintained their defensive line very successfully, and as a result, the British forces had to halt their attack due to heavy casualties. According to British sources, the attacking Anti-Axis forces encountered fierce resistance from a large number of the latest 75mm cannons, which fired incessantly from both sides throughout the day. According to a Reuters correspondent stationed in Washington, it was widely reported in Washington last night that the Axis forces were preparing to join part of their main forces in the battle against the U.S. forces advancing from Gela. News from the Anti-Axis headquarters in North Africa reported that air reconnaissance teams had seen Axis forces making significant movements south from the interior of Sicily. The rumors of a fierce Axis counterattack against U.S. forces in southern Sicily largely refer to the Gela area. Washington believes that this is the prelude to a major battle, with both German and Italian forces involved in the counterattack. Last night, the German News Agency learned from the German High Command that although the Anti-Axis forces had made victorious counterattacks in several places on Sicily, Berlin believed that the battle for Sicily was still in its initial stages. For military reasons, the details of the current stage of the battle cannot be released. However, the enemy has begun to feel significant supply difficulties due to the serious losses suffered by transport ships. The attacks by the German and Italian air and naval forces on the Anti-Axis ships have seriously hindered the operations of the British and American forces. The German side stated that from a military perspective, the position of the Anti-Axis forces is extremely unfavorable, as their supplies must be transported across the sea and their base of operations is only a relatively small coastal area. Berlin explained the severity of the Anti-Axis ship losses by saying that in the first twelve days of July, the British and Americans lost a total of 300,000 tons of ships. The success of the defense of Sicily is due to the large formations of Axis air forces being able to brave extremely heavy anti-aircraft fire and launch fierce attacks on Anti-Axis transport ships. It is said that two giant troop transport ships, totaling 20,000 tons, were directly hit and sunk near the southern coast of Sicily on Monday. A 5,000-ton munitions ship was also sunk. Several barges nearby were also destroyed. In addition, eleven ships carrying troops and heavy equipment, totaling 40,000 tons, were also directly hit and severely damaged, forcing the Anti-Axis forces to abandon them. Furthermore, six fully loaded landing craft were hit and set on fire by German fighters, causing very serious losses to the U.S. forces.</p>
<p>Fighting Will Reach Catania</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Rome, July 14th. ANSA News: According to the message on the situation in Sicily published in yesterday's Italian "Giornale d'Italia", it can be seen that Catania, the second largest city on the island, will soon have fighting. After occupying the port of Augusta, the British and American forces have advanced along the coastal highway to a location 50 kilometers from Catania. The city has a population of 220,000 and is not only the most important commercial area on the island, but its scenery is also the best on the island. After the eruption of Mount Etna in 1693, which destroyed the entire island, the city was rebuilt according to a unified plan. The soil and building materials are mostly lava, so the city's air-raid shelters should be the best on the island.</p>
<h3>Rumor: Eisenhower Has Returned to North Africa</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, July 14th. According to a dispatch from Algiers, General Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of the Anti-Axis forces in the Mediterranean, returned to North Africa from Sicily yesterday.</p>
<h3>German Forces Switch to a Major Offensive on the Eastern Front</h3>
<p>The major battle in the central sector of the Orel-Kursk-Belgorod region has already begun. Two million German and Soviet troops are engaged in fierce offensive and defensive battles in the Kursk salient, which are intensifying daily. The mobilization of people and material by both sides is extremely active. On the 7th, the German authorities announced that the battle of Orel-Belgorod had transitioned from a "counter-offensive" to a new stage of "offensive war." Elite German divisions have broken through important Soviet lines in various locations, crushing several enemy positions. On the first day of the counter-offensive, the 5th of this month, the German forces were subjected to a fierce attack by Soviet tank groups, but the German forces accurately identified the technical defects of the Soviet tanks, skillfully attacked them, and quickly annihilated 120 of them. On the second day, the German forces added new elite infantry reinforcements and the new "Tiger" tank units to meet the latest Soviet tank groups and the strongest assault mechanized units, penetrating deep into the enemy's lines in one fell swoop, achieving great results, and destroying 196 tanks. On the third day, the 7th of this month, they seized the initiative of the offensive war, and the situation changed into a formal large-scale mobile war.</p>
<p>German "Tiger" Tanks Deployed for the First Time</p>
<p>This battle is not a simple battle on a broad front. On the Eastern Front, centered on Kursk, there are many individual battles taking place along the line from Orel to Belgorod. Their scale and qualitative intensity are comparable to the large-scale offensives that occurred on the Eastern Front in the past two years. The most noteworthy aspects of the current situation are the intensity of the new tank formations and air combat of the two armies. In addition to the U.S.-made "Lee" and "Grant" tanks, the Soviet army also deployed the newly touted T-34 tanks in an attempt to break into the German lines. The German army first deployed sappers, anti-tank grenade launchers, and cleared minefields in front of the German forces, and then used tank units to switch to the offensive. Germany deployed the latest "Tiger" tanks to the Eastern Front for the first time, using their equipment and firepower to suppress Soviet tanks. On the 6th alone, 196 Soviet tanks were destroyed.</p>
<p>637 Aircraft Shot Down</p>
<p>The German Air Force not only provided cover for dive bomber attacks, but its fighter squadrons also engaged the Soviet Air Force in major air battles, recently creating a record of shooting down 637 aircraft. Comparing the air force strengths of the two armies, with the ratio of German to Soviet aircraft at 1.5 to 1, the German forces hold a dominant advantage, showing that the German Air Force's spirit is still as high as ever. Moreover, the German forces are gradually advancing eastward from the south of Orel and the north of Belgorod, and are pushing the large Soviet army protruding to the west of Kursk into a large encirclement. If this move is successful, the expected human and material losses to the Soviet Union will be very significant.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Defends with All Its Might</p>
<p>Since March 23, although the past few months have been superficially peaceful, the two armies, who have been buried in preparations for battle, suddenly chose the same area as the main battlefield, for two reasons:</p>
<p>(1) The traffic in this area is more convenient than elsewhere, making it easier for the two armies to assemble and move.</p>
<p>(2) The area between Belgorod and Orel can be said to be the crucial point of the center of the Eastern Front, serving as the center of operations.</p>
<p>However, German military personnel in Berlin are trying to avoid explaining the developments of this battle, and unanimously maintain that this decisive battle is not the "summer offensive" that the German army claims. They point out that the Soviet Union is publicizing this as the beginning of the German summer offensive as a propaganda tactic to cover up the failure of the Soviet army's own offensive, and claim that the Soviet Union will inevitably repeat the failure of the Kharkov offensive. In fact, according to reports from war correspondents on the front lines, the Soviet army, taking advantage of the convenient traffic network concentrated in this area near Orel and Belgorod, assembled a large army of one million, devoting all its efforts to building strong defensive positions, and attempting to seize the opportunity to take the offensive. Moreover, the Soviet defensive positions almost resemble permanent positions, and the internal positions in the rear gradually weaken, which proves that they have the intention of taking the offensive against Germany.</p>
<p>The Seriousness of the Situation</p>
<p>The German army has resolutely endured this offensive by the Soviet Union because the German army has already had three experiences of transitioning from a "counter-offensive" to an "offensive" posture since the start of the war against the Soviet Union. The difficult first operation was last summer when General Timoshenko launched a large-scale offensive against the German army in the Kharkov area, leading to a counter-offensive and immediately changing to a summer offensive. The second was also in the Kharkov area. Taking advantage of the momentum of the winter offensive at the beginning of this year, the outstanding German divisions in Field Marshal von Manstein's operation, the Hitler Division, and the Greater Germany Division, stopped the fierce offensive of the Soviet army, and transitioned from a counter-offensive to an offensive, securing strategic ground. This time, the German army had already known about the Soviet army's offensive operation prepared in this area against the German army, so it concentrated as many reserve troops as possible in the Orel and Belgorod areas. On the night of the 7th, their spokesman said:</p>
<p>"The reason why the German army had strictly maintained silence on the Eastern Front before was to adopt an inductive operation, intending to inflict as many material and human losses as possible on the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>Although the German army has not yet mobilized its main tank forces and taken a true offensive, the German and Soviet armies will certainly carry out tremendous mobilizations of people and materials in the future to expand the battlefield and intensify the fighting. The movements of the entire Eastern Front in the future will be seen in the situation of these few days. Therefore, the published news is extremely cautious and concise, and deserves attention.

<h3>Self-Defense Corps on Duty, Investigating and Prohibiting Bad Habits</h3>
<p>The Municipal Baojia Committee stated that when the Municipal Self-Defense Corps members are on duty, they often exhibit various bad habits such as being shirtless, smoking cigarettes, watching street operas, and dozing off, which is highly inappropriate. The organization of the Municipal Self-Defense Corps was originally intended to enhance the self-defense capabilities of citizens and ensure local security. The duty of Self-Defense Corps members is to assist the military and police in jointly maintaining security, and they should serve diligently in the spirit of autonomy, which is the foundation of local self-government. If these habits are not strictly rectified, they will greatly affect the future of self-government. In addition to sending personnel to secretly investigate at any time, the committee has also ordered each office to instruct its subordinates to strictly investigate and prohibit such behavior. Those who dare to disobey will be punished immediately in accordance with the reward and punishment measures, in order to rectify these habits.</p>
<h3>Water Company Stipulates 50% Increase in Water Rates; Calculated Based on Water Meter Readings from August 1st; Company Lost Approximately 8.8 Million Last Year</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai, July 14th) The Japanese military-managed Shanghai Waterworks Company only converted old currency prices to new legal tender prices for consumer usage in May of last year. Subsequently, in order to cooperate with the price policy, it intended to suppress the increase in water rates. However, recently, due to the soaring price of raw materials and the increase in salaries for employees, the current water rate structure has resulted in large losses (approximately 8.82 million last year), making it difficult to manage. Now, it has been decided that starting with the water meter readings on August 1st, the current water rates will be increased by 50% to balance income and expenditure. The water rates of the Shanghai Waterworks Company have always been extremely low, about one-third cheaper than the water rates of the Central China Water and Electricity Company (2.3 fen per cubic meter). Although the Shanghai Waterworks Company is increasing water rates this time, it will still be only half of the water rates of the Central China Water and Electricity Company, and will also be lower than the water rates in North China and Manchuria. In addition, the company has decided to change the graduated water rate system to a single rate system to conserve water.</p>
<h3>Joint Venture Company Rice Ordering: Part of the Order Has Arrived in Shanghai, Next Period's Ration Can Be Increased</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai News Agency's inquiry with the Rice and Grain District Management Company, the first batch of 20,000 piculs of rice (reported by Datong News Agency as 100,000 piculs) arrived here from the Suzhou production area on the 10th, and will be available for purchase today.</p>
<p>Strict Management of Joint Venture Company Members</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rice and Grain Joint Venture Company previously handled member registration, and certificates were issued in accordance with regulations. Those who have not joined the company will not be allowed to operate in the food industry. The company is striving to guide the public food supply onto the right track. If any rice merchant who has joined the joint venture company is found to be negligent in service, violates regulations for personal gain, or hinders public interest, they will be ordered to withdraw from the joint venture company, and their registration certificate or registration book will be revoked, and they will never be allowed to engage in the same business again.</p>
<p>Next Period's Ration Should Be Increased</p>
<p>According to Mr. Zhang, Chairman of the Municipal Grain Committee: The distribution of household rice in the city was reduced to one Sheng in the 40th period, and the dates were also delayed for a year. As for the 41st period and the 19th period in the urban area, they were also temporarily changed to one Sheng per person due to the above reasons, but the monthly period has been on time. Now, the first batch of a large amount of national rice from the Joint Management Company arrived in Shanghai daily starting from the 10th, and the rice for this period is also mostly supplied by the company, and the ration will definitely be increased starting from the next period, or the original amount of grain will be restored.</p>
<p>41st Period to Be Sold Universally Starting Tomorrow</p>
<p>The rice shops in the two concessions and the rice sales offices of the Public Works Department will simultaneously start selling the 41st period of household rice tomorrow. Citizens can purchase one Sheng of white rice, broken rice, or brown rice from designated rice shops with the No. 41 joint ticket of the rice purchase certificate. The selling price is 4.5 yuan. The validity period is until the 22nd of this month, but all rice shops and rice sales offices will temporarily suspend rice sales for one day on the 20th.</p>
<h3>Commemorating the Recovery of the Concessions: Grand Sale from August 1st for Three Days, and Window Display Competition</h3>
<p>The Shanghai concessions will soon be recovered. The city's merchants and people will have a grand celebration to express this historically significant event. The Municipal Propaganda Department, in order to guide public propaganda, has jointly organized a shop window propaganda competition with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The overall plan has been decided. All industry associations will mobilize all shops in the city to hold a three-day celebration grand sale from August 1st to 3rd. From the 1st to the 7th, displays related to concession propaganda will be arranged in the windows. Experts will be hired to judge. Those with excellent results will be given prizes, bonuses, and certificates to encourage them. The detailed measures are currently being drafted and will be announced and implemented once decided.</p>
<h3>All Sectors Express Their Views on Education Grants</h3>
<p>The following is a compilation of letters received by this newspaper yesterday from all sectors expressing enthusiastic support for and promotion of education grants: Mr. He Zhuoxian generously donated 5,000 yuan. Regarding education grant opinions, he believes that one should maintain the spirit of self-respect and strive to achieve something before receiving a grant. Grant providers should not start from pity or charity. In addition to donating 500 yuan himself, Mr. Zhang Liangyu also raised 1,000 yuan from Shende Qianzhuang. Mr. Ling Sijun, on the occasion of the birth of his second son, combined the gifts and cash received to make a whole number of 500 yuan to benefit relatives and friends. Mr. Shao Shengrong donated his entire monthly salary of 400 yuan as an assistant manager at the bank and hopes that colleagues and seniors in the industry will join in the sponsorship. The enthusiasm of all sectors in supporting this newspaper's education grants is truly admirable.</p>

However, in the future, the Lian Bao head should supervise and stop unauthorized fundraising.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Shen Bao North China Emergency Relief Painting and Calligraphy Charity Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Feng Weichang</p>
<p>For the past two days, the Shen Bao has been holding the "North China Emergency Relief Painting and Calligraphy Charity Exhibition," which has been widely publicized. Despite the muggy weather, I also went to visit the art treasures with excitement, and to witness the ideal "righteous and courageous" scene of everyone competing to purchase items to help disaster relief.</p>
<p>The venue is located on the fourth floor of the former HSBC Bank on the Bund. Its surroundings are majestic and magnificent buildings overlooking the Far East. It faces the Huangpu River, which is bright and open, cool and comfortable, without any urban atmosphere. Although the weather is dull, the visitors are still particularly enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Among the exhibits, the highest priced item is the handwritten vertical scroll by Sun Yat-sen donated by Mr. Ding Fubao (priced at 100,000 yuan). I think that those who respect and commemorate the founding father and are concerned about the disaster victims in North China will not hesitate to pay this amount. Next is the running script by Chairman Wang donated by Han Jingqi, priced at 10,000 yuan. Perhaps during the competition, someone will offer a higher price to obtain it. Let us wait and see. Secondly, the original works of Kaizhong Gate and the masterpieces of famous people in ancient and modern times are extremely rare treasures. In a word: "A dazzling array of beautiful things!" In addition, there is also a five-carat diamond ring donated by Mr. Sansheng, which is extremely valuable and priced at 160,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday and today, the young painters Chen Penglu and Chen Honglu brothers, and the young painter Qian Hailong, were specially invited to paint on the spot and sell their works for charity. Many kind people also donated a lot of treasures, so the visitors and buyers were even more crowded.</p>
<p>The initiator also went to watch again, as if there was still more to see. It is said that the guests who attended the event totaled no less than several thousand, including Chinese and foreign celebrities, scholars, and artists, which is considered the grandest event of its kind for emergency relief in North China.</p>
<p>The organizers of the event also hope that people from all walks of life will enthusiastically donate and purchase items, achieving two goals with one action, and striving for perfection, taking it as their responsibility to save as many lives as possible. After my visit, I also sympathize and appeal for it.</p>
<h3>Rationed Sugar Supply for the Fifth Period: Deadline for Payment and Delivery (Most of the Ninth Period Cigarettes Have Been Picked Up)</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Merchants General Business Office, with the approval of the military authorities, handled the fifth phase of rationed sugar distribution and the purchase of sugar for June by special group users (i.e., type B retailers). Preparations have been completed, and sugar purchase certificates will be issued within three days from yesterday to tomorrow, and the following methods are specified:</p>
<p>Deadline for Delivery to Avoid Mis-Selling Sugar</p>
<p>(1) Retailers who sell rationed sugar should bring the previously issued blank receipts with their seals affixed to the office within the above-mentioned deadline to fill in the amount of items to receive the purchase certificate. And pay the payment to the designated sugar company before the 17th of this month, and deliver the goods no later than the 20th of this month, so as to avoid the date of mis-selling sugar. (2) Special group users should also bring the purchase application receipt to the office within the above-mentioned deadline to exchange for a purchase certificate. And pay the payment to the designated sugar company before the 17th of this month. Each user should bring the deposit receipt when exchanging the purchase certificate to the office in order to adjust the amount separately. As for the sugar bag deposit, starting from this period, it will be directly deposited with the office in accordance with the provisions of Announcement No. 119 to serve as a long-term guarantee. (3) All users who were previously given mandatory allocations will be included in the special group and should pay the certificate money as required. It is reported that the quantity and price of the fifth phase of rationed sugar will be temporarily the same as the previous phase, and the cooperative will officially announce it within days. The sugar price for type B users and special allocations will be calculated according to the adjusted new price, plus a retail donation of 2%.</p>
<p>Slight Reduction in the Quantity of Cigarettes Allocated in the Ninth Phase</p>
<p>The China Tobacco Allocation Association has notified all wholesalers and retailers to pay for and pick up the ninth phase of allocated cigarettes. Most shops have now picked up the goods, and the ninth phase of cigarettes will be sold soon. It is reported that the quantity of goods dispatched in this phase is slightly smaller than the previous phase due to the moldy season. The type of cigarettes still adopts a mixed system.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Will Promote Income Tax: Tax Policy Will Change After the Recovery of the Concessions</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government and the Japanese authorities signed an agreement on June 30 in the capital to return the Shanghai Public Concession. From August 1st, the government will implement the recovery of all administrative rights of the Public Concession. The issue of recovering the French Concession has also been negotiated several times and has achieved satisfactory results. It is reported that the Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance of the National Government and the Tax Investigation Office of the Ministry of Finance are actively researching and promoting the income tax plan and detailed implementation methods for investigating tax evasion in order to prepare for the unified promotion of tax policy as the time for the recovery of the two concessions approaches.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Phase Has Not Been Sold Out: Postponing the Deadline</h3>
<p>According to a reporter from Guofeng News Agency, the Shanghai Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office decided to issue the fourth phase of allocated edible oil in the city and the two concessions at the same time. However, among the total amount of more than 8,000 dans issued, 4-5% has not been completed. It has been decided again, hoping that residents in a few areas who have not yet obtained four taels of edible oil per person will not have any doubts, because the office will not handle the special allocation of oil for the fourth phase and the oil for restaurants until the universal sale of oil is completed, and then it will be handled according to the situation.</p>
<h3>Painting and Drama Associations Welcome Director Liang of the Propaganda Department</h3>
<p>Since the National Government issued an order appointing Liang Xiuyu, consultant of the Propaganda Department, as the Director of the Propaganda Department of Shanghai Special City, he has been actively preparing and planning future work policies and is quite busy. In order to express their welcome, the city's Chinese and Japanese cultural circles, initiated by the China Painting and Drama Association, held a tea party at the International Hotel yesterday afternoon. More than 100 representatives from newspapers and magazines attended. Feng Jie, the former Director of the Shanghai Office of the Propaganda Department of the National Government, attended as a guest. Shangjue Dailang, Director of General Affairs of the China Painting and Drama Association, entrusted by the Propaganda Department of the National Government, delivered a welcome speech, followed by Feng Jie. Finally, Director Liang of the Propaganda Department delivered a speech. The situation was enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Social Association Promotes Welfare Undertakings</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Chinese Social Undertakings Association, under the leadership of Director Ding, has organized undertakings that have become quite widespread, especially in the capital, such as the Vocational Guidance Center, Children's Education Institute, Obstetrics Hospital, Mass Funeral Home, Mobile Library Car, Small Loan, etc., which are beneficial to society. The association has set up promotion departments in various provinces and cities. The Shanghai Promotion Department was established in January of this year, located at No. 69, Zhaofeng Village, Yuyuan Road. The undertakings that have been undertaken include the Personnel Consulting Office, Free Tutoring School, Labor Children's School, and Labor Clinic. Currently under preparation are the Poor Children's Sales Group, etc., which are all welfare undertakings that benefit the poor and the public.</p>
<h3>Wu Chao Succeeds as Chief of Zhabei Police Bureau</h3>
<p>Sun Jiang, the chief of the Zhabei Police Bureau of this city, applied for resignation due to illness, which was approved by Lu Ying, the chief of the Municipal Police Headquarters. However, because the northern district is important and the railway station is nearby, the supervision of police affairs in the district cannot be interrupted for a day. Therefore, Wu Chao, the chief of the Inspection Department, was specially transferred to serve as the chief of the Zhabei Police Bureau. After receiving the order, Wu went to the bureau to take office a few days ago. The position of chief of the Inspection Department will be temporarily held concurrently by Zhu Susheng.</p>
<h3>Welfare Bureau Director Concerned About the Health of Those in Care</h3>
<p>Sun Mingqi, Director of the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau, inspected the relief home (Yelai Road, Nanshi) hosted by the bureau for the second time the other day and gave a speech, saying: "When this bureau took over in March, I came to inspect it once and saw that there were many people in care with dark skin and thin bodies and many who suffered from skin diseases. Now I see that the faces of all the people in care have gradually become rosy and the skin diseases have been mostly cured. However, the municipal government stipulates that the food ration for each person in the hospital is 3.2 yuan per day, which is really meager. It has been clearly ordered that the investigation and statistics section should investigate the prices of commodities before purchasing food and report them to the director for approval. The general affairs section then purchases them, the accounting section inspects and receives the payments, and then hands them over to the supply section for safekeeping and distribution. All staff members have the responsibility to supervise each other. Every morning before selling, a list of the daily supplies for the people in care should be prepared and posted in the hospital, indicating how many yuan for rice, how many yuan for meals, and how many yuan for sugar, oil, salt, firewood, etc. Whether they are consistent should be verified and weighed daily by representatives elected by the people in care in rotation in order to achieve perfection. The staff in the hospital are poorly paid and extraordinarily poor, but they should have a spirit of sacrifice. I hope they will work hard and conscientiously."</p>
<h3>Shen Bao Cup: North China Relief Donation</h3>
<p>The Shen Bao Cup North China Relief Donation yesterday continued to receive 500 yuan from Qiu Xianghua and 400 yuan from Zhou Shulian, totaling 900 yuan in storage vouchers. The balance is 5,900 yuan.</p>
<h3>Little Painter Paints for Guests</h3>
<p>This newspaper is hosting the North China Emergency Relief Painting and Calligraphy Charity Exhibition. Starting at 3:00 pm today, young painter Qian Hailong will be specially invited to paint for guests to help add to the fun. Mr. Qian held a solo exhibition at the Daxin Painting Hall in 1940 and 1941, which was well received. He also participated in the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association and won many silver cups and silver tripods. In 1942, he participated in the painting and calligraphy charity exhibition of the orphanage and the painting and calligraphy charity exhibition for the relief of overseas Chinese in Nanyang. In 1943, he won first place in the calligraphy competition of the Confucian Society. He is currently 14 years old and has studied English and Japanese at Liangcai and Mu'ertang Second Night School. He is also a student at Jinan Affiliated Middle School and will enter the first year of senior high school in the regular middle school next semester. Children are welcome to visit.</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Radio Application for Permits: Deadline is the 20th of This Month</h3>
<p>The Japanese Army and Navy authorities issued a notice at the end of last year, stating that anyone who manufactures, uses, possesses, or transfers prohibited radios must apply for a permit from the authorities before July 20 and provide detailed instructions for everything. Those who do not complete the formalities within the deadline will be severely punished according to military law. The authorities recently issued another statement as follows: The Supreme Commander of the Japanese Dispatch Army in China and the Supreme Commander of the Chinese Fleet issued a notice on December 18 last year prohibiting the manufacture, use, possession, or transfer of radios. The application for permits in the Shanghai area will be closed on the 20th of this month, and those who violate the regulations will be cracked down on immediately. In the future, without legitimate reasons or in violation of regulations, (1) radios with more than seven tubes, (2) radios that can listen to frequencies outside the range of 550 kHz to 1500 kHz, (3) those who manufacture, transfer, or use radios that can be arbitrarily changed into two-way radios for transmission or communication without reporting to the responsible office. In addition, those who possess radios in items (1) and (2) and have not modified them in accordance with the regulations and obtained the prescribed permits, etc., who violate the provisions of the notice, or engage in activities that are beneficial to the enemy or attempt to benefit the enemy, in addition to confiscating the radio, will be severely punished according to military law.</p>
<h3>In the Midst of Unified Promotion of Charitable Undertakings: A Visit to the Poor and Sick Relief Association</h3>
<p>After Guan Ting, Lin Kanghou, and Yuan Ludeng, three elders, published an article "Thoughts on the Unified Promotion of Charitable Undertakings," it aroused the attention and interest of the general public in the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association. It turns out that there is such an organization for relief and guidance of charitable groups and civil organizations in Shanghai! In order to satisfy the hopes of the society, the reporter specially visited the association and recorded its actual situation so that readers can see the bright side that is working seriously at this time and place.</p>
<p>The Motives and Nature of the Establishment</p>
<p>Number 402, Continental Building, the words "Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association" written horizontally on the closed door of an ordinary office told me that I had arrived at my destination. The staff were working quietly but nervously, and almost no one noticed a reporter's visit. A worker led me to the "Committee Room," where a person in charge warmly shook hands with the reporter and immediately answered the reporter frankly! No, it is also the questions that today's socially minded people have about the association.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association was established last autumn because the number of poor and sick people in Shanghai increased day by day, which aroused the compassion of people with hearts. As the association's "Origin" states: "What we see every day are pigeon loft households, homeless crowds, malnutrition, disease, and bodies lying dead on the road, numbering in the dozens or hundreds every day, and the number of children's bodies is often more than double that of adults, which is especially alarming." If this phenomenon is not automatically eliminated by more affluent citizens, the consequences for the future of society and the country will be unbearable. Therefore, Wen Lanting and other celebrities enthusiastic about charitable undertakings invited like-minded people to establish the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association and launched a fundraising campaign to raise 5 million yuan in new currency for emergency relief for the poor and sick. They first assisted those whose situation was the most miserable, whose affairs were the most dangerous, whose rescue was urgent, and whose effect was the greatest. The main subsidized undertakings are (1) emergency relief for epidemics (summer), (2) porridge and clothing distribution (winter), (3) education and training of homeless children (proactive), (4) relief for the old, weak, disabled, and thin (passive), and (5) medical treatment and medicine distribution. As for the method, it is "to selectively subsidize charitable organizations in this city that have the same purpose as this association and have achieved results, based on the severity and urgency of the situation." Therefore, the association itself does not organize any charitable undertakings and has become an agency for supporting charitable organizations. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Vocational Introduction Section Handles Registration of Heavy Occupations: Education Level from Elementary School to College or University</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Vocational Introduction Section of the Industrial and Social Department of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession has been entrusted by various Florida companies to recruit various talents, reaching 987 people. More than 550 people have been employed through the introduction of the section. It is reported that the section is determined to uphold the purpose of serving the society and recommend suitable talents to suitable careers in the fastest and most convenient way so that employees can give full play to their strengths and work efficiency can be doubled. It is also learned that the section has recently been entrusted to recruit various talents, with a large number of people, whose education level ranges from elementary school to college or university. Therefore, letters are sent to famous schools in the city. Graduates who want to find a job can bring two recent two-inch photos to register at Office 362A, Public Works Department Building, Fuzhou No. 80. The section will consider introducing a suitable career for them. All procedures are free of charge.</p>
<h3>News Association Stipulates Economy Day</h3>

As a result of the meeting, the previously decided plan to implement the expanded propaganda week starting from July 15 was changed to be held continuously for one week from July 20 to 26 in order to collect materials and enrich the content to achieve great results. Six major economy creeds were formulated to promote citizens to practice economy, revitalize their families, and serve the country. Finally, it was unanimously passed to stipulate the 9th of each month as Economy Day, without smoking or drinking, in order to cultivate an economical atmosphere and complete the mission of saving the country through economy.</p>
<h3>Prisons and Detention Centers Reassigned to Prosecutor's Office</h3>
<p>After the expansion of the prosecutorial powers of the courts at all levels in this city, the Prosecutor's Office was formally established on the 1st of this month upon order, separating it from the court so that the legal system would be more enriched and comprehensive. According to reports, all prisons and detention centers have also been ordered by the Ministry of Justice to be reassigned to the supervision of the Prosecutor's Office.

<p>Economic News and Commentary</p>
<h3>Enterprises and Talent</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in discussing the pathological state of the Chinese economy, there was one matter that I felt compelled to mention: the relationship between enterprises and talent in the Chinese economic sphere. Recently, there has been a trend of rapid development in various domestic enterprises, but the most difficult aspect is the lack of true talent, especially talent applicable to the industrial and agricultural sectors. On the job-seeking side, there is a lament of "overstaffing," while on the employer's side, there is a cry of "talent is hard to find." The reason for this is that job seekers tend to be ordinary talents, while the business world seeks specialized technicians, especially specialized talents suited for the industrial and agricultural fields. In recent years, the nation has faced many crises, and all endeavors have been neglected. Institutions for cultivating talent have not yet paid attention to this point. Coupled with transportation barriers and the dispersion of talent, the business world often laments the difficulty in finding talent. Recently, I heard that those in charge of running agricultural and industrial vocational schools, with the aim of training specialized talent suitable for agriculture and industry, are gathering experts to discuss solutions. From this, one can see that business people, feeling the lack of talent, are urgently trying to train their own. However, this matter is of great importance, involving countless details, and is by no means something that private forces can handle alone. It is hoped that those in charge of education and business leaders who bear great expectations will all pay attention and work together to cultivate industrial and agricultural talent to meet the needs, both as preparation for improving their own industries and as a contribution to post-war production. At the same time, we must ensure that many graduates have something to do, so that they do not graduate from school and become unemployed in society. In particular, educators should be aware of the great responsibility and quickly work together with business leaders to build a solid foundation for the business world and to find a proper path for the future industrial and agricultural talent. The development of the new China's industrial and agricultural enterprises depends on this!</p>
<h3>Ministries of Finance, Food, and Industry to Confer on Unified Food Control</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central Social News Agency): The procurement and distribution mechanisms for supplies in Central China are now under our own unified control, following the Japanese implementation of a new policy towards China. All matters are being promoted under the new organization of the Commercial Unification Council. Regarding the procurement of food, the Ministry of Food of the National Government directly manages this transitional phase. Subsequently, as a result of the Ministry of Food's efforts, the food industry association organized the Rice Cooperative Society, which is progressing rapidly. Therefore, the issue of whether the Commercial Unification Council should uniformly control food is being re-examined. This afternoon at 1:00 PM, National Government Finance Minister Zhou, Food Minister Gu, Vice Minister Yuan of the Ministry of Industry, and related personnel from the Japanese Embassy held their first consultation at Minister Zhou's residence. It is expected that liaison meetings will continue on this issue in the future. In terms of promoting the unified control of materials in Central China, the results are highly anticipated.</p>
<h3>List of Members of the Wuhan Materials Control Council</h3>
<p>Hankou, 14th (Central News Agency): The Wuhan Branch of the Materials Control Review Committee is about to be established. The mission of this committee is to control materials, suppress prices, and other matters. It is expected to stabilize the people's livelihood in the province in the future. The list of members of the committee is as follows: Chairman: Yang Kuiyi, Governor of Hubei Province; Vice Chairman: Zheng Zuyu, Governor of Jiangxi Province; Zhang Ren, Mayor of Hankou Special City; Committee Members: Chen Weizheng, Yao Yixin, Advisor Enokiya, Chief Staff Officer Ogawa, Department Head Otowa, Department Head Kazusumi, Naval Attache Okino, Consul General Takatsu, and Cai Wenshi, Sun Ditang, Hashimoto Seiji; Secretaries: Youshi Zhendong, Xu Shenzhi, Zhou Lianzhen, Lieutenant Colonel Yamamoto, Major Nakano, Endo, Chief of the Third Section of the Liaison Department, Lieutenant Commander Fujishima, and Vice Consul Matsuo.</p>
<h3>Municipal Materials Investigation Committee Divides into Three Zones for Investigation</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Materials Investigation Committee has set up an office in the Ma Ting Building on Jing'an Temple Road to begin its work. Regarding the overall task of investigating stockpiled materials, Chinese and Japanese investigators from the committee's investigation team hold investigator liaison meetings on a regular basis to communicate and exchange ideas on the investigation work, and are proceeding step by step. After several recent investigator liaison meetings, a concrete plan for investigating materials has been agreed upon, and personnel will be dispatched to conduct investigations separately, starting immediately. The scope of the investigation is temporarily divided into three major areas: the First Special Zone, the Second Special Zone, and the Urban Area (including Nanshi, Huxi, Zhabei, and Pudong). It is reported that the initial targets of investigation are essential commodities such as daily-use cotton yarn and cloth. This is because cotton yarn and cloth prices have recently risen sharply, and it is inevitable that there will be speculative hoarding activities. If evidence of hoarding and profiteering is found, those responsible will be reported and dealt with in accordance with the regulations for punishing hoarding.</p>
<h3>Various Trade Evaluation Committees Commence Work</h3>
<p>The various industry trade association evaluation committees organized by the city's trade associations to assist the authorities in suppressing prices have been actively carrying out evaluation and investigation work in recent days. It has been found that past work focused on price limits, which led general unscrupulous merchants to replace goods with inferior products in order to obtain illegal profits. Therefore, in addition to price limits, future investigation work will also closely monitor whether goods meet standards. Large numbers of investigators are dispatched to member stores and retail departments every day to conduct secret investigations. Once it is discovered that goods exceed the price limit or do not meet standards, the store will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Mark Prices</p>
<p>The various industry evaluation committees have specifically notified member stores and retail departments that they must mark the price of each item displayed and not be ambiguous. It is found that the settlement authorities have also repeatedly ordered this measure, because marking the price of goods not only facilitates customers, but also makes investigation work easier.</p>
<p>No Refusals to Sell</p>
<p>Recently, stores have often concealed goods and refused to sell them, which is tantamount to hoarding in disguise. The various evaluation committees also attach great importance to this and dispatch personnel to conduct close investigations. If the above situation occurs, it will be reported to the trade association for handling.</p>
<h3>New Directors and Supervisors of the Banking Association Take Office</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association convened a meeting of member representatives on the 26th of last month and elected the 14th Board of Directors and Supervisors. Before the new Directors and Supervisors took office, all association affairs were temporarily handled by the previous Executive Committee. Now, the association held a joint meeting of the new Directors and Supervisors the other day to hold an inauguration ceremony and elected Yu Fuxiao as Chairman of the Board, Wu Zhenxiu, Guan Tingmin, Zhu Rutang, and Zhu Bosu as Executive Directors. The date of the first meeting of the Executive Directors and the number of meetings per month have not yet been decided.</p>
<h3>Stock Exchange to Resume Operations in Mid-August</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange, which has been closed for a long time, is now actively preparing to resume operations under the responsibility of Zhang Weiru, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the China Merchants Bank and former Chairman of the Stock Exchange, after being ordered by the Ministries of Finance and Industry to prepare for the resumption of operations. The exchange has decided to hold a shareholders' meeting at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club at 2:00 PM on the 24th of this month to discuss the number of brokers to be reorganized and the increase in capital. It is estimated that in addition to the original 80 brokers, 35 Chinese stock brokers, 42 foreign stock brokers, and 43 other brokers will be added, for a total of 200 brokers. The capital will be increased from the original old currency of 1.2 million yuan to 20 million yuan in national currency. Part of it will be recognized by the old shares, and part will be raised by recruiting new shares. It is scheduled to resume operations and trading in mid-August. The trading will mainly be in Chinese stocks, but in order to prevent speculation and currency outflow, all transactions will be limited to spot trading in principle.</p>
<h3>Trend of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks first fell sharply, then suddenly surged. A certain group was very active, and all those seeking to sell were absorbed. After 10:30, all new and old stocks were in a state of demand exceeding supply. The New New Company of the department store industry once retreated into the Customs, then flew back out and exceeded the peak of the previous day. Yong'an and Guohuo Company rose after a pullback, with the latter approaching the major hurdle. Neiyi and Jingfu Jinglun two shirts rose sharply throughout the day. In the textile industry, Yong'an Textile rose by hundreds, Rongfeng Textile and Dasheng Factories 1 and 3, and small denominations such as Xinfeng Printing and Dyeing, Meilun Plush, Guoxin Dyeing and Weaving, and Xinhe Yarn Factory were all advancing to new highs. In the cultural industry, the prices of the Commercial Press, China Bookstore, and World Bookstore unexpectedly rose. Nanyang Tobacco, Great China Matches, and the public utilities Zhabei Water and Electricity and China Merchants Electric disappeared from sale. The new pharmaceutical industry, Minyi, Zhongxi, and Star Perfume, became firmer. Great China Industrial and Jiu'an Industrial both saw active trading and price jumps. Xinyi Real Estate was firm, and Xinya Construction was strong.</p>
<h3>Money Houses Tighten Lending, Credit Tightens, Interest Rate Opens at 24%</h3>
<p>The market conditions in Shanghai's various industries have tightened slightly due to rumors. Although the black market for rice is calling for high prices, it is restricted by the authorities' ban, and no formal transactions have been completed. Gold shops are claiming to have no spot goods, and no exchange transactions have been made for two days. The handling fee for door-to-door sales cannot be increased, so they would rather not do business. Speculative rice merchants are also hesitant because they have no way to purchase spot goods. There is not much change in military tickets and joint tickets. The market price of stocks and cotton cloth has slightly increased. In order to prevent speculation and curb the rise in prices, money houses of various financial institutions are tightening their lending business. As a result, the money market in the city is tightening, and the interbank interest rate rose by 2 points yesterday (14th) to 24%. The overall financial situation remains stable under the extensive support of the Central Reserve Bank. Although the market situation seems tense on the surface for the past two days, the actual financial situation is unusually solid.</p>

<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>The Xinya Enzyme Factory, owned by Xu Guanqun, has been expanding its business since its capital was increased to 7 million yuan. The yeast produced by the factory is known as the "Five Great Fermentation Agents," and its alcohol production can reach 400 gallons per day, with a content of over 96 degrees. The daily turnover is as high as about 100,000 yuan. After recent research, the factory has switched to using dried sweet potatoes for fermentation and refining alcohol, which can further reduce costs.</p>

<h3>Restoring Social Morals</h3>
<p>— Zhen Diao Ge</p>
<p>Nowadays, many people in the community feel that "human relationships are thin." As a result, they have turned their attention to classical Chinese literature. Consequently, many people are inscribing maxims and printing family precepts to give to relatives and friends, with the aim, of course, of benefiting future readers. These actions and views are indeed worthy of praise and commendation, but I feel doubtful about their effectiveness.</p>
<p>If one wants to be a "gentleman" or a "sage," one needs to cultivate oneself. Although it is not necessary to "travel ten thousand miles and read ten thousand books," one must at least know something about the way to conduct oneself and the methods of cultivation. The best way to do this is through maxims and family precepts, because these are the "personal experiences of hardship and adversity, and the insights gained from self-reflection and self-discipline" of the ancients. Moreover, the sentences are short and easy to remember. However, I believe that if maxims are copied in books, family precepts are printed in books, and even if "utensil inscriptions" are remembered on all daily necessities, but they cannot be put into practice, they are still useless and cannot "restore social morals." On the other hand, even if there is no collection of maxims or family precepts, but each person has a sentence that they consider the most useful maxim and remember it in their heart, practice it at all times, reflect on it at all times, and constantly improve oneself, then perhaps there can be some effect.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that maxims are necessary, but they require you to know and then act, and act in a concrete and practical way. It is definitely not possible to "restore social morals" by simply copying some good words and printing some family precepts.</p>
<h3>Peking Opera and Film</h3>
<p>— Yan Huizhu</p>
<p>People often ask me: "What is it like to sing Peking Opera and act in movies?" My answer is: both are art. Although the meaning is the same, the methods of expressing art are different, so the taste is also different.</p>
<p>Peking Opera has a fixed script, and the same few plays are always sung. Although movies also have scripts, what is filmed each day is completely different. In Peking Opera, the distance from the audience on stage is far, so it is very convenient to sing. In movies, although there is no audience, there are many staff members on the set. If you are shooting a close-up, very close to the camera, you have to make various different expressions, such as smiling, crying, talking, and other actions. It is really difficult. In Peking Opera, you cannot sing the wrong words, otherwise, the audience will boo. It doesn't matter in movies, if you say something wrong, you can reshoot it. Also, when singing Peking Opera, you can't see for yourself whether it is good or bad. Whether the tone and body language are good, you must have an observer to criticize. Movies are different. When the filming is finished and it is screened, you can watch your own acting, and you can see whether it is good or bad at a glance.</p>
<p>From this, we can see the different points of artistic expression between Peking Opera and film. This is my personal feeling when filming the movie "Elopement."</p>
<h3>Random Notes from the Movie City</h3>
<p>Hua Ying's basic actors Rong Na, Yang Liu, and Kui Jiajia went to Tianjin a few days ago and performed on stage at the Xinzheng Central Theater in Tianjin. After receiving the news, Hua Ying's Actors' Department specially sent Wu Wenchao to Tianjin to negotiate and urge Rong Na and others to return to Shanghai to work. The North China Performing Arts Association also urged them to return quickly and sent personnel to accompany them to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Following "Silk," which is playing at the Da Guangming Cinema, "Imperial Stele Pavilion," starring Wang Yaoqing from Beijing, will be screened. This film is a Peking Opera performance brought to the screen, and the actors are all outstanding talents from the Beijing theater scene.</p>
<p>Since filming began on "Rebirth," seven or eight tenths of it has been completed, and it is scheduled to be completed before the 20th of this month. Wu Lei, the screenwriter and director of "Rebirth," caught a cold while going to Yangzhou to shoot location shots for "Elopement." After returning to Shanghai, he was busy with the work of "Rebirth," which led to typhoid fever. He was sent to the hospital on the first of this month and unfortunately passed away the night before last, at the age of twenty-five.</p>
<p>Zhu Shilin's new work, "Second Generation," was explained at the Huaying Fourth Factory in Xujiahui Triangle on the afternoon of the 13th, and filming will begin in the coming days. The male roles in the play are played by Liu Qiong, Lu Yuyi, and Gu Yeqi, and the female roles are played by Tong Yuejuan and Chen Qi.</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese co-produced song and dance film "Ten Thousand Purples and Thousands of Reds" is being worked on day and night. Director Fang Peilin and star Li Lihua have both become thin due to overwork. It is reported that the filming has now been completed and will be screened at the Da Guangming Cinema on the 28th of this month.</p>
<p>After the filming of "Ten Thousand Purples and Thousands of Reds" is completed, Li Lihua will continue to film "Begonia," directed by Ma Xubang.</p>
<p>Zhang Shichuan's new work after "Red Face Iron Blood" is "Happy Angel." The script has been approved, and it will star Li Hong. Filming will begin on the 16th of this month.</p>
<p>Huang Han's new work, "Rebirth," is being prepared. As soon as the scenes are completed, the actors will be selected.</p>
<p>Li Xianglan's new film "Yellow River" has been released in various parts of North China.</p>
<p>Huaying Company is filming a major film on the disaster situation in North China, "A Thousand Miles of Mourning." Wang Yin has been designated as the director because Wang Yin is from Tianjin and is more familiar with the disaster situation in North China than other directors. Wang Yin will personally visit the disaster area in North China for on-the-spot inspections when necessary. Gao Zhanfei, Cai Qiuxia, and Yan Jun have been internally designated to star.</p>
<h3>Parental Love</h3>
<p>— Hong Nong</p>
<p>If people do not know the love of parents, when will they call on their parents in times of difficulty? If people all know the love of parents, when will they forget their parents in times of peace and happiness? If people do not know how to serve their parents, when will they teach their children to be filial? If people all know how to serve their parents, when will there be so few filial sons?</p>
<p>Hair has fallen and teeth have loosened, think about what your parents have become old for? Panting while lying down and struggling to walk, think about what your parents have become ill for? Unwilling to seek beautiful clothes, unwilling to seek fine food, think about what your parents have saved for?</p>
<p>Although the daughter-in-law is healthy, she cannot be diligent. Love for the daughter-in-law all stems from the love for the son's heart. The grandson is in her arms, and she dares not startle him. She loves her grandson even more than her own feelings. When her son goes out, she advises him earnestly. Her soul often flies to a thousand miles on the pillow. When her son is ill, her heart is sad and her eyes constantly shed a thousand lines of tears. If her son has done wrong, she does not speak of it. If people talk about it, she must cover it up. When death is imminent, her eyes do not close. If her son is by her side, she still turns her eyes. From youth to strength, and from strength to old age, the heart that loves the son wholeheartedly will not be finished even in death.</p>
<p>May I ask, can the son ever fully understand? The young crow knows how to feed back, and the lamb knows how to kneel and suckle. Even birds and beasts are like this, why do human beings not realize it? Do not say that there are too many things to neglect, please wait for leisure to make up for it? Do not say that you do not have the strength, please wait for when you can do it? I only fear that the son will wait, but the parents will not wait. The wind stops and the trees are still, and the grief and tears are in vain!</p>
<h3>Chicken</h3>
<p>— Shen Shen</p>
<p>Li and Lu both stared at Staff Officer Zhang at the same time, nodding their heads without a word to say. Everyone was thinking, what kind of trick is this? While they were lost in thought, there was a sound of footsteps at the door, and two people in gray clothes and flat-topped hats walked in,挟 [xié] carrying a haggard A-Kun, who was hanging his head and not saying anything. Town Chief Li immediately ran over and said.</p>
<p>"A-Kun! Let's go back together!" A-Kun still didn't know what was going to happen to him, so he was obediently manipulated. Suddenly, he heard Town Chief Li, whose voice was very familiar, calling him, so he raised his head and showed a weak and powerless look, looking at the two people in gray cloth standing beside him, sobbing and unable to speak, nodding slightly.</p>
<p>"You go back together! There's nothing wrong!" Staff Officer Zhang said to Town Chief Li, and waved his hand to the two people in gray cloth beside him to tell them to leave. Town Chief Li put his arm around A-Kun and said:</p>
<p>"Let's go! It's getting late!"</p>
<p>"Thank you, Staff Officer Zhang! Tomorrow we'll have tea at the Wu family teahouse in the east of town and talk." Town Chief Li greeted Staff Officer Zhang while walking out.</p>
<p>"Okay! We'll talk again tomorrow. Goodbye!" Staff Officer Zhang said, and sent them out to the outside door, past which was the street.</p>
<p>"Goodbye! Goodbye!" Town Chief Li greeted, and the three of them walked straight west. After only a few steps, Town Chief Li had already reached the door of his own house, knocking on the door while saying:</p>
<p>"A-Kun! Don't be sad, go back and rest. It's already a great fortune to be able to spend the night at home tonight. You have to know that it's destined for you to have something happen. These days, bad luck often comes from the sky even when you close your door and sit at home! What can you say? Junqiang—the name of the Lu Jia Chief—you should rest early, you're very tired!" After saying that, he went into the house. A-Kun nodded, and Lu Jia Chief also went back to his own house first. A-Kun, with heavy steps, the waning moon in late September, hanging in the sky, it was already late, looked at the old wooden door of his own house, and a slight light was revealed from the cracks, knowing that his wife was still waiting. A burst of howling—howling—howling dog barks, in the moonlight, his own dog couldn't recognize his master's face, and chased and barked madly, approaching and discovering that it was his own master, and immediately wagged its tail and jumped to express its close welcome to its master. Could it be seen in his eyes that his master had already suffered a huge trauma in his heart? A-Kun naturally couldn't muster up the interest to tease the puppy, and silently went forward. But that innocent puppy didn't show any snobbery and kept following its master. (Eleven)</p>

<h3>Re-examination of Ginkgo for Treating Lung Disease</h3>
<p>(1) Ginkgo, also known as Bai Guo, contains toxic substances. Contact with the skin can cause inflammation and rashes. Its components contain two kinds of "ginkgolic acid" and "ginkgo oil," which can only kill pneumococcus, erysipelas streptococcus, or gonococcus. Ancient medical prescriptions have used it effectively in many cases, but it is ineffective in killing tuberculosis bacteria. The letter from a friend in Beiping published in your newspaper probably refers to the fact that pneumonia and lung abscesses have been cured. If the sputum contains pus and blood, resembling bayberry, or the sputum resembles iron filings, resembling containing dust, eating raw ginkgo every day, seven grains a day, will surely cure it in seven days. If you don't use ginkgo, then taking the western medicine "Solacil" has the same effect. As for the treatment of tuberculosis, eating more pine nut meat, cod liver oil, and air needle injections can treat it. In recent years, I have been extracting vitamin K from pine nut oil to treat the first and second stages of tuberculosis, which has been quite effective. Burning rue and other things in the sickroom has also been effective. As for how to extract chemical components from other various aroma oil types for injection to treat tuberculosis, I am currently conducting research and analysis. (Fan Fengyuan). (Correspondence address: Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory, 914 Avenue Edward VII, Shanghai).</p>
<p>(2) Take a fresh pig lung, wash the blood clean, then draw out the tibia tubes on the lungs, add two taels of spinach, five or six slices of fresh ginger, and a little aged wine, simmer the broth over low heat and eat it lightly. Do not use soy sauce. If you find it too light to eat, you can add a little fine white salt, as little as possible. The above is for the early stages of lung disease. About three to five servings will be effective. If it is pulmonary atrophy, you need to add two qian of Ophiopogon japonicus and one qian of unprocessed Rehmannia root and boil them together. In short, there are many kinds of lung diseases, and they cannot be generalized. For example, pulmonary abscess, pulmonary atrophy, weak lungs, or blood in the sputum, etc. However, lung disease is not a terminal illness. Patients often hesitate in their views, resulting in delays or self-inflicted harm, or due to psychological effects, resulting in chronic illnesses that cannot be cured.
