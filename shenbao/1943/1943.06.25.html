<h3>當前切要的經濟問題　希望於第二次全國經濟會議者</h3>
<p>全國經濟委員會第二次全體委員會議，今日在南京舉行，集行政人員。企業家與經濟學者於一堂，政府報告經濟行政設施，企業　家陳述推進經濟事業所能收獲之成效以及事實上遭遇之困難，經濟學者提供學理上解決問題之意見。檢討過去，融會當前事實，決定今後對策。我們相信舉行會議之目的，應在於此，而決不是遵照會議規則的規定，經過若干時開會一次，「行公事」而已。</p>
<p>這次會議，所討論的議案範圍，事前未見公佈。我們認爲在二月十二日第一次會議中討論決定的「戰時經濟政策綱領」，即經十三日最高國防會議通過由國民政府公布。那末，這一個經濟政策綱領，可說是該會第一次會議的成績，經過了四個半月以後的第二次會議中，應當首先切切實實的檢討一下，在四個半月的過程中，對於所決定的「經濟政策綱領」所包含的項目，是（一）已經做到了那幾項目？成效如何？（二）正在推行的那幾項目？成效如何？（三）那幾項目是事實上行不通或是目前不能行的？（四）那幾項目尙未進行，其原因何在？（五）那幾項目特別需要積極推進？等等，這一個檢討工作，將是今决會議的重要課題。因爲戰時經濟重要部門，已在政策綱領中包括無遺，祇須根據政策綱領，製成具體推行計劃，如能澈底做到，則於軍需物資之供應與後方民生之安定兩大目標，自可達成，不必另闢經濟施策，別求經濟制度。因此，我們敢於說，今次會議，應着重於前次議案執行程度的檢討，而作適應環境利於執行的修正議案，同時，更應作支援政府執行決議案的議案。</p>
<p>我們始終認爲改善民生與安定民生爲政府經濟設施最要之目標，人民生活安定了，才可以源源供應物資，適應總力參戰。當然，我們所謂人民暴漲的威脅，而苦心焦慮於生活問題。而安定民生的經濟應策，並不是奇方異藥之須待名山訪求，只就公布的政策綱領，實已相當完善，祇要負執方異藥之須待名山訪求，只就公布的政策綱領，實已相當完善，祇要負執行推動之責的各部門，能夠發揮領導性能，按步就班，循序以進，相互配合，相互協力，一定會過一天有一天的成績，做一分　一分的收穫。如果政策公布了，會議開過了，就算告一段落，那末，紙上的文字，終究是紙上文字，雖千百年也不會變質，莫說四個多月了。</p>
<p>茲就四個多月來，我們見聞所及，以戰時經濟政策綱領爲根據，以安定最低限度的民生爲目標，對於經濟設施，略申所見如次：</p>
<p>（一）增加生產，無論從任何觀點而言，爲目前經濟問題中最重要的一點，農產品之增產計劃，分區擬定，從速推行。種籽之改良，新式農具之使用，耕作技術之指導，均須從農村下層切實做起。農村貸款，先從農村調查入手，交通銀行已在進行，但一行之力，決不能普遍，以上海銀行之多，資金之厚，應放遠目光，做些有利國家與人民之事，組織農貸集團，共同辦理，以宏實力。這裏，當然是幫助農民增加生產，并非收買土地，製造大地主。此外，如華北旱災各省，需要種籽殷切，就須設法接濟，務使不致連荒，重增民苦。工業增產方面，亦須通盤籌劃，軍需及主要民需品務使充分增產，原料供給，運輸便利，均須顧到。尤其是動力供給之不合理情形，亟應調整，例如民生日用品工廠，因受電力限制，雖有增產計劃與原料人工，結果仍受影響，而絕對消耗之娛樂塲所，電力則幷不困難。如果移此就彼，一方面收日用品增產之利爲，一方面减消耗之糜費。諸如此類的不合理現象，如能完全以國家人民利益的經濟觀點，予以澈底調整，深信對於安定民生，貢獻戰力，均有莫大裨益。</p>
<p>（二）穩定幣値亦爲現階段經濟問題中最値努力而且必須做到的一事，我們並非說目前幣値有何不穩定現象。上次經濟會議時，市上謠傳政府將發新通貨，經周部長闢釋而謠息，不久以前市上又傳中儲行將發行五百元券，經公布之中儲行修正法中並無此規定而證明妄傳。凡此謠傳、雖爲無中生有，庸人自擾。但是我們站在人民立塲，也得平心靜氣的計算一下貨幣購買力的趨勢如何，不說去年六月掉換舊幣以來，就是今年一月以後，已經不能說正常了。不過，這趨勢的形成，雖不單純，而與物價高漲的循環性，已經人人具此心理，這種心理演變至今，已非辯正解釋所可濟事，而要以事實來矯正，就是通貨政策與物價政策要有脣齒密切的關聯呼應，相輔相成了。</p>
<p>（三）物價，不待說是最關民生的問題，自從上次經濟會議以後，成立了全國商業統制總會，擬以統制經濟疏通物資爲手段，而期達抑平物價的目的。指定主要商品先行登記，搬運時先行允許，把握物資，疏通物資。便配給物資，迄未實現。此外，囤積居奇，原爲物價高漲之一因，其間政府也曾下令澈查，並組織物資調查委員會。市經濟局亦有評價機構設立。對於物資物價之設施，似在積極籌議，可是，我們一察事實，則橱窗標價，月有遞增，而近數日間，又在衝動，尤以紗布爲甚。於此，我們盼望各關係當局密切注視這問題，共謀有效遏制辦法，任其自然，既非所宜，相互觀望諉卸，更非人民之願。</p>
<p>我們實在卑無高論，而念及民生前途，則憂心如擣。覆按我們過去的言論，對於物價問題，曾作多方面的律議，言之至再至三，而今日的事實則又如是，更增無言之慚。所以我們今天所願竭誠貢獻於全國經濟會議諸君子者，僅以「溫故知新」，與「重在實行」兩句。今天所記的，還是昨天說過的，倒是眞理；今天所說的，明天就去實行，才是實幹。</p>

<h3>華北日記者團追記　汪主席談中國現勢</h3>
<p>北京二十四日中央社電　北京日本記者團，最近曾赴華中考察，在南京時幷承汪主席親予接見，略談中國現勢，茲追記要旨如次：（一）政治意識之昂揚」，六月十日最高國防會議中曾決定戰時文化宣傳要綱，其目的在動員全國文化思想界，以提高完成大東亞戰爭之戰時意識，今後將根據此次要綱，肅正思想訓練民衆之戰時生活。（二）「國民政府及國府所屬華北政務委員會」國民政府行政院係負責直轄地區之行政。北方各省市行政係由華北政務委員會負責。中央所期於華北政委會者即在政治經濟文化及各方面遵照中央意旨，採取同一步驟，以完成大東亞戰爭。（三）「淸鄉工作」淸鄉工作自推進以來，迄已兩年，共地區逐漸擴大，現正謀推至江蘇北部地區及杭州北方地區之治安範圍。過去淸鄕地區之工作及行政，係由淸鄉委員會負責，但最近已改歸行政院直接指揮，以期政治力之澈底滲透。（四）「渝方動向」渝方勢力其要素有三，即其直系軍雜牌軍及民衆是。第一類之渝方直系軍如胡宗南，現擁有兵力六十萬，但幷未與日軍作戰一次。彼等妄信英美終必獲勝，且認縱不獲勝利，但亦不致失敗，故繼續從事無益抗戰。第二之雜牌軍原爲反對蔣介石者，但其對國民政府之爲有力而足以信賴之政府一節，因尙缺乏認識，故今猶奉渝蔣之命從事抗戰，彼等若準確認識國民政府之和平建國理念，則必將紛紛來歸參加和運，至第三之民衆，則對渝蔣之榨取，早已深抱反感，惟缺乏力量，不能積極實行大規模之反對運動，在此種狀態下，渝方之能保持其地位者，理由有三，一，爲渝方擁有糧食能自給之農村，二，爲犧牲民衆，確保軍隊，尤其渝直系軍隊，其勢力並未有過份之消耗，三，爲受英美等種種之物質援助，即作積極宣傳以防民心離散。總之，吾人實不可期待渝方之自行崩潰，而應增大國府力量，吸收渝方軍隊，以積極的促進渝方之崩潰。</p>
<h3>谷大使召集陸海軍長官　商收回滬公共租界　並訪褚外長墾談一切</h3>
<p>南京廿四日中央社電友邦日本爲實踐中日基本條約之精神，尊重中國之獨立自主起見，東條首相已於第八十二屆議會席上發表施政演說，向內外闡明日政府之所信，披瀝其加强對華緊密協力之決意，進而謀中日條約之根本改訂。此項演說披露後，不僅東亞各國極爲注視，我舉國朝野，尤極爲歡迎，此實爲友邦日本對吾眞誠協助之有力表現。最近由日返任之日本駐華大使谷正之在歸途中經過上海時，曾由田尻公使陪同陳市長會見，對收回上海公共租界問題，雙方無隔　交換意見，懇談結果，極爲圓滿，谷大使返京後，並於二十四在大使館召集現地陸海軍長官，協議上項各問題，研討結果，亦頗良好。預料上海公共租界之收回爲期匪遙，此固爲中日兩國親善史上光榮之一頁，亦爲吾國全體國民所殷切企求者也。</p>
<p>南京廿四日中央社電日駐華大使谷正之氏此次返國述職與政府當局協商關於對華新政策各項問題，意見已完全一致。大使於廿日返抵上海。廿二日午前會見田尻公使，並拜會上海特別市陳市長，關於國府收回上海公共租界問題，曾作縝密之協議，並於是日返京。廿三日廿四日兩日復與褚外交部長就上海公共租界及與此有關之各項問題有所懇談。廿四日午後三時半更在大使館召集田尻公使及其他當地海陸軍關係者，就上項各問題舉行協議。</p>

<h3>最高國防會議　昨開第十九次會議</h3>
<p>南京二十四日中央社電　最高國防會議廿四日舉行第十九次會議通過要案甚多，茲擇錄如左：（一）主席報吿秘書處案呈准中央政治委員會秘書廳檢送奉交行政院呈據外交部呈准丹麥駐我國公使照會，爲奉本國政府訓令，聲四交還厦門鼓浪嶼公共租界行政權，業經本部照復同意抄附往來照會呈核一案，除分令外，呈請備案等因，已准備案。（二）主席報吿據行政院呈據外交部轉據駐京城總領事林耕宇呈送國防獻金二萬元，業　令發財政部存候　用，除分呈國民政府幷咨行軍事委員會外，呈請備案等情，已准備案。（三）主席交議據恢復國立中央研究院籌備委員會主任委員褚民誼呈擬具本會組織規程及經常費支出概算書，並請加聘程演生顏福　龍沐勛胡瀛洲爲本會委員，呈請鑒核等情，請公決案，決議通過。（四）主席交議據新國民運動暑期集訓委員會呈爲據公務人員暑期集訓營營長陳春圃靑少年團暑期集訓營營長林柏生會呈擬具新國民運動第一屆公務人員暨靑少年團暑期集訓營，第二期開辦費及經常費支出概算書呈核一案，轉呈鑒核等情請公決案，決議通過，交行政院轉飭財政部照發。（五）主席交議秘書處案呈准軍事委員會函爲本會已派龐炳勳　第二十四集團軍總司令，孫魁元爲副司令，請轉呈鑒核追認等情請公決案，決議追認外，特任龐炳動孫魁元爲軍事委員會委員。（六）主席交議擬持派余天休爲全國經濟委員會委員請公決案，決議通過。</p>
<h3>柴山視察　鄂各地軍情</h3>
<p>漢口十四日中央社電　日前蒞臨武漢之柴山氏，連日公私酬酢甚忙，後氏爲明瞭此間各地軍事情形起見，特於日前視察陸軍第二十九師後，復不避艱辛，親臨豫南信陽廣水等地區視察陸軍第十一師，對於該師　紀陣容馬匹糧秣服裝器械生活情况等，垂詢甚群。視察結果，極爲滿瀋。</p>
<h3>實部袁次長談　物資管理統制問題</h3>
<p>南京二十西日中央社電　國府自參戰以後，凡屬一切政治機構，經濟建設，及物資管理，均已循戰時體制積極展開。實業部袁决長，昨就物資之調查管理統制各問題，作詳細之闡述，茲將大意誌後：最近爲進一步澈查奸商之囤積居奇操縱市面，最高國防會議特設置物資調查委員會，於本月二十二日正式在滬成立。中日雙方委員名單，已由主管機關任命。爲工作便利起見，特聯合在滬辦公，將來工作，中日雙方採取分頭進行之方式。凡在法租界公共租界市政府所轄之區域，均將嚴密進行，一經發覺囤積情事，即由物資調查委員會厘定適當價格收賣之。但其終極目的，仍在使囤積之風滅絕，物價得告穩定，而至於配給均勻，並已定於七月初開始調查工作。此次調查委會內部機構，極爲嚴密。全市中日高級官員，預料今後工作展開，必極順利，對於一般投機奸商，決不使之逍遙法外，貽害社會影響民生。又全國商業統制總會最近已改隸行政院，故對於將來物資統資與管理，亦必有更完善之措置。當局刻正積極計劃，預料不久，當可逐步厘訂實施。</p>
<h3>糧部周次長　談民食問題</h3>
<p>南京二十四日中央社電　中央社記者於日昨往訪糧食部次長周乃文，叩詢際此青黃不接之時，政有當局對民食之措置及本年度麥季收成，暨不久配給麪粉等各種問題，承周次長一一詳答，茲分誌如下：（一）本年蘇浙皖各地小麥大致均已登塲，惟屆收割時期，雨水稍多，收成略爲遜色，平均估計華中本季小麥收成大的在八成以上。至華北方面本年食糧情形亦可望豐收。（二）歷年每屆靑黃不接時期，輙感食糧恐慌，今又遭其時，本部職責所在，不砍因共困難而諉其責任，仍督飭內外屬力圖補救。在積極方面儘量搜購米穀，補充大量粉麥，在消極方面勸導人民節的消耗，加强緝私，防止外流，總之難關當可中渡。（三）麵粉亦爲主要糧食之一種，如何統收統配，正由全國商業統制總會籌劃實施，糧食部現已預計需要配給數量，送由商統會核議，將來各地如何糶售，尙須詳密考慮。</p>
<h3>日軍殲滅　順德東南共軍</h3>

<h3>德蘇戰綫嚴陣對峙</h3>
<p>（庫比希夫細中特派員二十日特電）六月二十二日爲德蘇開戰二周年之期。這二年間，作戰的指導權，有時在德，有時在蘇，極變化之能事，而且雙方都沒有獲得決定的成果，夏季有利於德，而冬季有利於蘇，二年來的德蘚戰就在這狀况中過去。</p>
<p>空軍開始活躍</p>
<p>去年夏，德軍席捲頓河，庫彭河，北高加索地區，加爾姆克草原地帶一帶的廣大區域，進抵斯達林格勒，而到達了蘇聯的動脈伏爾加河畔。但冬季降臨後，紅軍轉取攻勢，奪囘了斯達林格勒，頓河地區，加爾姆克草地帶，北高加索，且突入唐納資區域而收復卡科夫，在此地遇到德軍的及攻，放棄卡科夫，而重又退同唐納資河東岸地區。四月。五月，雙方都在作戰鬥準備而過去了，東部戰綫暫吿平靜。但自五月初起，德蘇雙方空軍的活動漸次活躍，蘇聯空軍開始長距離轟炸東普魯士，波蘭，西烏克蘭，而德國空軍則對前綫地帶羅斯托夫、巴泰斯克，克拉斯諾達爾『庫斯克等地的交通綱加以集中的轟炸。於是蘇聯空軍也停止長距離轟炸，轉而對前綫地區的德方運輸設施及軍隊，物資的集中地點加以轟炸，至六月，雙方的報後轟炸日趨激烈，德空軍進攻伏爾加河上游及中游的天空，空襲果里基，耶洛斯羅里，轟炸薩刺托夫。</p>
<p>何方先發制人</p>
<p>如此，東部戰綫的情勢異常緊張。現在的問題，在於那一方面，在何時何地先行開始大規模的軍事行動。德軍去年五月八日在克爾衆半島開始作戰，五月十日，爲牽制蘚軍，對卡科夫地區轉取　勢，由據蘇聯情報局發表，這奉制戰僅在阻止德軍的進攻羅斯托夫上獲得成功，而德軍在六月初强襲塞伐斯托波爾，六月中甸，在卡科夫東方庫比揚斯克轉取攻勢，至六月下旬，束部戰綫以快洛尼茲爲目標的德軍攻勢達到了最高峯。今年六月，所刹不出句日，而束部戰綫尙未開始像去年那樣的大規模行動，毋青有失之過遲之嫌。這事態應怎樣來說明呢？因冬季戰繼續了很長的時問，要完成次期攻勢的必要準備，不能不費相當的時間。這或許是一個理由，蘇聯一般民衆，以爲東部戰綫遲不開始大規模行動的綠故，乃是因爲英美開闢第二戰綫的緣故。最近因奧萊爾，庫彭地區的戰况、漸呈活躍，故相當加以注目。德蘇二軍同稱此不過爲局部的戰事，綜觀東部戰綫的情勢，現在的緊迫空氣，似即將達到最高峯，德蘚二國互相凝視對方，靜待世界情勢的推移。</p>
<p>大部分蘇聯民衆，雖不知道何方取主導權，他相信東部戰綫的大規模行動即將開始。自五月一日斯達林委員長發表布告以來，蘇聯各報對蘇軍及蘇聯民衆發出警吿，指出德國現在尙保有重取攻勢的軍事力。</p>
<p>重心在於中綫</p>
<p>總合各種情形看來，今夏首先發動的可能性，最多的地方是中部地區，這區城內，雙方的防禦戰均深人對方，互相威脅陣地，將爲德蘇二國活躍地點，雙方同擬從這地點發動具有決定性的第一次攻勢。從此點看來，最近該方面的地上部隊頗見活躍，德蘇雙方均以此方面的運輸設施及軍隊集結地點爲轟炸目標，標堪注目，有許多人則預期東部戰綫的南部地區將爲主要戰塲。（翔：譯向六月二十一日四部朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>西綫空戰益趨劇烈　英美機羣猛襲德工業中心　兩晶中喪失達一百卅五架</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十四日中央社電　西部戰綫之空戰，最近益趨激烈，反軸心空軍以所謂「飛行堡壘」之超重轟炸機爲主力，曾連續於二十一日夜二十二日晨二十三日夜大舉空襲德國西部，盲炸魯兩地方之鋼鐵業中心地帶，復會於二十三日傍晚空襲法國馬恩地方。英空軍部於二十三日發表公報，承認轟炸德國西部時喪失飛機三十七架，路透社並會報稱，此次空襲曾遭受德軍戰鬥機及高射砲空前之猛烈反攻云，足證當時空戰之激烈。據德軍當局之統計，反軸心空軍自二十二日晨迄二十三日晨一畫夜間，喪失重轟炸樓達百三十五架，內並有「飛行堡壘」二十八架，乘員損失達千七百人。同時德空軍轟炸機隊並會對英本土作大舉報復之轟炸，猛炸倫敦地區周圍之重工業地帶，收獲戰果甚大。又據路透社二十三日電，自本年一月迄六月十九日空襲英本土之德機，累計達一萬四千架。</p>
<h3>蘇人民委員會　柯錫琴任主席</h3>

<h3>聯營社整配米糧　凖下月起開始　計口授糧仍由原辦機關轉配</h3>
<p>華中米穀組台，自將華人方面之配米工作，移交於上海區米糧聯營社後，該社連日積極籌備一切，茲悉該社配米工作，準自七月一日正式開始。</p>
<p>米糧來源可分二種</p>
<p>昨據該社負責人談。聯營社米糧之來源，可分二種：一種爲國外運滬之洋米，由日本大使館供給，數量的爲全額三分之一。另一種則爲國米，由糧食部供給，此項國米由糧食部從蘇。浙。皖三省各產米地區統一收購得來，數量佔全額三分之二。按洋米方面，由大使館負責源源長供，國米一項，目前外埠尙有餘剩，可以運滬，一俟秋季新毅登塲，糧食部自當大量收買。</p>
<p>工作重心運輸整配</p>
<p>自七月一日起，該社即担任米糧之運輸及整配工作，糧食部自產區統一購得之米糧，按期配給於該社，由該社設法運滬，大使館供給之米，運輸事宜亦由該社担任，二方之米會齊後，由該社整配於工部局。公董局。以及市糧食局，由上開機關再行轉配於聯營社之社員商店，再計口配給於各市民，故聯營社並不直接担當計口授糧事宜，工作重心乃在運輸暨整配，實際上可謂爲糧食部與辦理計口授糧各機關間之中間機構。</p>
<h3>停雲樓助學義展　成績圓滿　總數逾三十萬金</h3>

<h3>市民福利協會歡迎　石射森喬兩使</h3>
<p>友邦石射大使暨森喬公使今次蒞滬，上海市民福利協會特定於今（二十五）日下午五時，假外灘十二號興亞大樓四樓工商聯誼會會議廳舉行茶會歡迎，柬邀本市中日官方暨各界名流參加，以資聯歡，按兩氏爲日本外交界傑出人村，對中國問題認識允多，今次來華，於促進中日合作上，必多貢獻，</p>
<p>石射大使談話　前任日本駐巴西大使石射猪太耶，爲視察中國情形。業已抵滬。該氏於昨（二十四日下午在百老匯大樓會見記者，關於以巴四爲中心之南美情勢談稱：巴西現在已與軸心國絕交，但於絕交後巴西外交部長曾對余再三說明，無論日本人外交官及日本僑民之權益，絕無任何妨書，日本大使館館員等完全享受行動自由，然於一月絕交迨至三月頃，吾等即遭軟禁，巴西開始壓迫日本僑民，同時並頒佈取締日本人令，殊令吾人憤慨。然巴西之對軸心絕交或壓迫日本人，均受美國之主使，常開戰時早已有美國關係官員在巴西情報局及警察本部監督取締日人，查巴西對日人素無怨隙，且於日本攻擊珍珠港後，並有衷心慶祝者，但因於經濟上完全依賴美國故不得已受美國之束縛牽制，爰有對軸心絕交之舉。此外，在南美阿根廷被稱爲海軍國，巴西則可謂陸軍國，近年來正積極擴張軍備，戰前大部份軍火均向德國購入，便現在又須向美國購買，巴西國之國家雖比較豐裕，但其政府極其貧困，屢對美國借入鉅款，美國乃巧妙利用鉗形束縛，此種美國之存心，非但對於巴西一國而已，即對於中南美各國莫不如此，現今唯阿根廷尙屹然以中立國之姿態存在，但阿根廷並有不少情形，大致不能自立，美國對之加以非常壓迫，即最近革命之幕後人，價並爲美國</p>
<h3>物資調查委員會　調查官事務所成立　分中日兩系統進行調查</h3>

<h3>金價與物價</h3>
<p>— 德森</p>
<p>自一九三一年世界各國相繼放棄金銀本位而入於紙幣本位或管理通貨本位後，黃金已不再作爲一國幣制的材料，照理黃金的價格就應當下跌，可是，終因黃金是一種稀貴的物品，結果金價不但不跌，反而騰貴起來，而金價對於物價，遂仍如昔日一般的，發生着重大的影響。</p>
<p>一國在戰爭時期，對外固求軍事上的勝利，對內則求社會經濟的安寧，欲求社會的安寧，首先要安定物價，因物價對於民生關係最爲密切。試觀各戰爭國家，無不對於物價方面加以嚴格的統制，配給，和監督。金價的漲落旣然影響物價如此之鉅，所以一國最高當局，在戰爭期間，對於黃金亦無不加以統制或收回國有，蓋恐金價的猛漲，以致影響整個國家的金融。</p>
<p>反顧上海金融市塲，自戰爭以來，黃金始終並未加以統制或收回國有，一任其自由漲落，對於物價，影響頗烈，對於一般人民，貽害非淺。蓋一般物價之上漲，雖亦由於來源稀少，運輸不便，成本增高，囤積居寄等等原因，但每逢金價猛漲一次，投機商人必藉口作高漲物價的最大原因，所以對於金價加以嚴格統制，是戰爭國家必然的措置。當局對於金價雖曾發更其過去自由波動的政策而加以始則三千元，繼則五千元之限價，使其不能再作漲價藉口，以安民生，何如黑市之中，無非陽奉陰違，終至超越限價，卒使近幾日來之物價，步步上昇，漫無止境，徒使人民受其痛苦，當局對於此種喪心病狂之舉動，自未必加以坐視，作者以爲當局若對金價能作進一步之統制或禁止其買賣，甚而頒佈黃金國有辦法，則金價影響物價的惡劣現象，當不至重見於今日。</p>
<h3>商統會將開始　實際統制活動　處監督指導地位不直接經營買賣</h3>
<p>全國商業統制總會以所屬下部機構之各業同業聯合會，糧食部份之雜糧業，麵粉業，畜產業，蛋業，糖業，食油業等六業聯合會，實業部分之煤業，棉製品業，皂燭業，烟業，火柴業，百貨業，酒精業，皮革業，絲綢業，化學工業，金融業，玻璃業，電器業等十三業聯合會，均已組織完成。尙有毛紡織業，棉花業，橡膠業等三聯合會，已將於最近期內組織成立。共粉麥業，棉業，糖業，食用油業四專業委員會，亦已成立，故決定於下月　開始活動辦理：（一）統制物資之收買配給，（二）國內各地域物資之交換營運，（三）輸出物資之哄給，（四）輸入物資之配給，（五）軍電物資之採辦，主管部指定一或委託之事項，在監督指導地位上，以不直接經營物資買賣爲原則云。</p>
<h3>中儲釐訂華商銀行　交換票據辦法</h3>

<h3>華股趨勢</h3>
<p>昨華股先跌後回，蓋初聞金價之狂落，後復爲新老投資者提上，經各股升多降少，照各方人心，於恍忽中仍帶空勢。文化業在一味買勢中，商務及中藥書局均見新高峰，世界獨平。公用業之閘北水電及華商電氣盤漲仍銳，大中華火柴再登高峰，南洋烟公司已趨呆平。紡織業升降不一，永安紡織及大生一三兩廠均見回跌，榮豐。國言。同濟多在向上進展中，大中華織造竟又做高元半，百貨業永安削低數元，新新及國貨挺升，景綸。景福兩衫襪有求少供。鴻興襪廠低價有買戶傾搜而抬上。新藥業升後回平如前。康元製罐有求乏供。新益地產呆平。久安實業關邊成交，通易信託仍　前價。</p>
<h3>商情摘要</h3>
<p>公債　統一公債暗市升後復回，甲乙丙丁戊五種債票無甚榮辱。</p>
<p>金銀　本市銀樓業大新同行首飾金門市照限價，惟手續費則隨市面一再增多，同業無實際行市，業外成交不旺，價格先升後回，結果仍超過六整數。紋銀掛牌不動，業外做價與前相同。</p>

<h3>省市銀行暫行條例　國府修正第六條條文</h3>
<p>南京二十四日中央社電國府命令（三十二年六月二十四旦）茲修正省市銀行暫行條例第六條條文公布之，此令。</p>
<p>修正省市銀行暫行條例第六條條文（三十二年六月二十四日公布）第六條，省市銀行，資本至少須達國幣六百萬元，由省政府財政廳或市政府財政局撥給之，並得擬訂招股章程，呈經核准，招集商股，但商股總額，不得逾資本總額百分之四十九，前項商股股東，以籍隸本省或在省市境內，置有產業住所者，儘先招集，如有不敷，得在營業區域以外招募足額，其股東以有中華民國國籍者爲限，前項股本，得分兩期繳納，全額收足後，如尙有增加之必要，得呈由地方政府轉請財政部核准增加之。</p>
<h3>商統會與中日經濟關係（三）</h3>
<p>關於中日間的經濟，一片合作哩，提携哩，叫得半天響，可是眞正能夠明白中國經濟內藏事實妁，那就不是一件易事。要曉得中國經濟，在中日經濟的分野上，是截然不同的。然而各方的雜亂主張，眞能夠明白重心，而把握中國經濟實情來努力的人，實在不多。這就是雙方的偏見誤解所致。要是雙方能夠正視事態，那未日方人士不參加到商統會中樞幹部內的這件事，是否有當，也能明瞭了以，時就曉得我們沒有一點後退的理由。從而可以認淸目標，勇往直前。中國方面對於同生共死這句話含有多大的意義，也要藉中日商界的調整利害關係，各自來理解，那麼錯誤的收囘國權意識，必能消散，中日經濟人的緊密合作，就能利用商統會的工作推進了，確信其必然可以顯現空前的明朗境界。</p>
<p>有人說：商統會誕生的必然性，在於中國的自主參戰，其實這也未必是正當的見解。我以爲吾人旣已知道中國是大東亞共榮圈內的國家，那麼無論蔣介石如何依賴英美來抵抗日本，不能說他不是大東亞共榮圈內的一個國家，所以不論中國喜歡不喜歡，天然指定了中國是大東亞共榮圈內的國家，所以，共榮圈國家的必然存在，就是商統會誕生的必然性，這秤見解才對。（未完）</p>

<h3>「新生」與「腐化」</h3>
<p>— 趙驤</p>
<p>老年可敬，而青年可愛？</p>
<p>青年時期是脫離了童年的愚昧，幼稚，無知，但尚保持着天真，坦白，純潔，既不染上有些中年人的易起的傷感，也不像一般老年人的帶着暮氣，彷佛利刃的新發於硎，熱烈的情緒，包含着沸騰的赤血，全身充滿着跚動的活力，生命之火正像狂颶樣熾燃着，猛烈的向着目標邁進着，絕不想到縮，恐懼，迥避，……</p>
<p>這種青青春的活力真是青年的可愛！</p>
<p>時代對於青年賦給重大的職責，國家社會對於青年寄予深厚的期望。</p>
<p>對知　的熱烈追求，對真理的堅貞；能虛心的接受教訓，能　格的下以批判；培養寬厚的德性，造成良好的習慣，有恭敬的禮貌，體格結實強　；未沾時下惡劣的風　；英　，有爲，這真是青年的可愛！</p>
<p>在皓首蒼髯的老年中有古董，不值可敬；但紅顏秀髪的青年中，也有「遺少」，在年齡上正當青春，風度翩翩，倜儻瀟洒，但精神却都已腐化，患者「未老先衰」平日生活昏庸老杇，說話不倫不頹，行動荒謬乖離，而又不學無術，無異走肉行屍，這種青年却在可愛之外！</p>
<p>粟之有秕，禾雜莠草，青年也不是個個優秀可愛，在純潔奮發向上的青年中，可得注意蟊賊敗類隱匿其中，但粟之成秕，要爲灌溉與肥料有關，祇有莠草，才是天生劣　，而人非木石，更無天生奴才，青年之流於　俗腐敗，實有種種原因，亦非一早一夕；青年亦應有此自覺，自惕，不要做時代的被揚棄者才好。</p>
<h3>鳴呼！老練？</h3>
<p>— 燕尾生</p>
<p>諺語說：「吃一次虧，學一次乖」，天下沒有「咄嗟立就，馬到成功」的事，釘子碰得越多，則　騐也越豐富，對於人情世故當然也更加「老練」了。</p>
<p>的確，越「老練」則離開成功之境也越近是地可諱言的，但很可惜，許多老練的人常是並不「精明幹練」的向着有爲的事業上謀發展，反而因了老練更回強他善於規　，　於　媚，成功對於人情世故養成不痛不　的感覺，不分是非的手腕，真是所謂「聰明反被聰明誤」的「老奸世　」的偏伙了，他們自以爲可以永遠「得心應手」，「左右逢源」地沾些便宜，但不知他的「成就」已止於此，早晚會招人鄙視，名譽掃地，而毀滅錦繡的前程。</p>
<h3>鐵肺人怎樣生育</h3>
<p>— 南人</p>
<p>報載鐵肺人又將生子，大家看了這個消息，一定有　不解，他終年睡在鐵肺之中，至多也不過能離開幾分鐘，那裏能夠結婚？怎樣可以生育呢？這不是一個疑問嗎？或者他結婚是在形色方面的，受胎恐怕是用人工的了，　是完全不對。</p>
<p>鐵肺人自從回國以後，依然不能離開鐵肺，離開了就不能呼吸，固爲他的呼吸神經壞了，除了鐵肺，是不能生存的。</p>
<p>他父親施立德是美國的銅鐵大王，有名的富翁，不知有多少萬的財產，祇生了這一個寶貝似的兒子，倘若他永遠　在這鐵肺之中，他父親不是等於沒有生兒子一樣嗎？將來這許多財產交給把誰？這個心理恐怕全人類都是如此！於是他的父親就講了：多有名的醫生和科學專家，來解決這個問題，怎樣才能離開鐵肺。以及結婚等等。</p>
<p>經過了許多專家精心的研究之後，才想出一個辦　來。離開　肺根本是不成功的，但是他　有不能呼吸，除了肺以外，其他都是很健全的，不能因肺一部分有病，而就連帶其他各部份都不自由，於是乎，就把這像小火輸船上，火艙裏的那個　爐一樣的－鐵肺，縮小到如巡捕抄把子所穿的銅絲馬夾一般。</p>
<p>鐵肺人自從穿了這個呼吸馬夾以後，那是便當多了，可以起坐，可以行走，當然可以結婚，那麼更可以生育了，科學萬能，於人類的幸福，是何等偉大！（酬移助學金）</p>
<h3>李麗華的話</h3>
<p>— 勞玉</p>
<p>夏天的太陽映射在大地上，我　辦公室趕到霞飛路　廉里去訪問「唔」女郎李麗華。</p>
<p>幸運得很，當我　進客堂間，就看見李麗華伏在　桌上寫信，她發覺了我的腳步聲時，連忙把信箋撕掉，搓得圓圓的，丟在痰孟　，立刻站起來，依舊甜姐兒一般活潑的　態，笑容滿面，招呼我坐，遍了一枝香烟吸了幾口，我便先開口問她：</p>
<p>「李小姐，近來忙得怎樣？「萬紫千紅」的舞台場面，聽說非常偉大，你可以講給我聽好嗎！」</p>
<p>「忙，當然是不用說了，一天到晚在攝影場上拍戲，拍完戲回家，又要學彈鋼琴，替影迷簽名，寫回信給影迷，真是累得要命，這半個月，沒有一天不拍「萬紫千紅」，那部新片的歌舞聲面，比較以前我拍的凌波仙子，還要偉大，」他回答說。</p>
<p>「那末　　表演有幾種歌舞呢？」</p>
<p>「抱歉得很，我說不出名目來，祇好說花樣兒很多。」</p>
<p>「這次　　有我少女團員參加？」</p>
<p>「記得最多一次拍歌舞場面，有三十多人，」</p>
<p>「萬紫千紅」的外影在什麼地方拍的？」</p>
<p>「就在星期一那天，自上午八時一直到下午六時，在兆豐公園拍的外景，風景很好，拍了二十多個鏡頭。」</p>
<p>「這部對，我很認真地拍，將來公演的時候，還要請大家多多的指教。」「你不用客氣了。」</p>
<p>「你這幾天，在報上看見有關於我的消息麼？」</p>
<p>「消息倒是很多，我們要喝你喜酒啦」。</p>
<p>「報紙上老是開我玩笑，真是莫名其妙？」她劂起了小嘴，帶着三分怒氣的樣子。</p>
<p>「那末多少是有些原因的，人家都說你要結婚了，這不見得是論傳罷。」　　我還年輕呢，　根兒談不到這種事情，請你不要相信這些風傳搖言，我可以坦白底說，結婚是誰都逃不了的事，不過我對於結婚認爲是一個家庭式的牢獄，甚至影響個人的自由，我現在獻身於銀壇，拍戲雖則是很累的，反正在精神上是很愉快的，你說對不對？」她雙手抱住膝蓋，瞟着咪眼兒，俏皮地說了一連串正經話。</p>
<p>「好了，我都明白了，還是談拍戲，李小姐近來的新作是那一部片子？」</p>
<p>「現在也沒有決定，也計等「秋海棠」拍完了再說。」</p>
<p>這時忽然有女僕　來說，「三小姐，勝利唱片公司有電話來催你去灌唱片，要你馬上就去。」</p>
<p>「好了，我知道了。」</p>
<p>「那末我要告辭了，再見，」我站起身對她點點頭說。</p>
<p>「真對不起，××先生再見再見，」她也姑起身送我出大門。</p>

<h3>Crucial Current Economic Issues: Hopes for the Second National Economic Conference</h3>
<p>The Second Plenary Session of the National Economic Council is being held in Nanjing today, bringing together administrative personnel, entrepreneurs, and economists. The government is reporting on economic administration measures, entrepreneurs are presenting the successes they have achieved in promoting economic endeavors and the difficulties they have actually encountered, and economists are providing theoretical opinions on solving problems. The aim is to review the past, integrate current realities, and determine future strategies. We believe this should be the purpose of the meeting, and not merely to "go through the motions" by holding a meeting every so often according to the meeting rules.</p>
<p>The scope of the agenda to be discussed at this meeting has not been publicly announced in advance. We believe that the "Wartime Economic Policy Outline" discussed and decided at the first meeting on February 12 was approved by the Supreme National Defense Council on the 13th and promulgated by the National Government. Therefore, this economic policy outline can be said to be the achievement of the first meeting of the council. At the second meeting, after four and a half months, the first thing that should be done is to thoroughly review the items included in the "Economic Policy Outline" that was decided upon. (1) Which items have already been accomplished? What are the results? (2) Which items are being implemented? What are the results? (3) Which items are practically unworkable or cannot be implemented at present? (4) Which items have not yet been implemented, and what are the reasons? (5) Which items particularly need to be actively promoted? This review work will be an important task of today's meeting. Because the important sectors of the wartime economy have already been fully included in the policy outline, it is only necessary to develop specific implementation plans based on the policy outline. If this can be thoroughly done, the two major goals of supplying military materials and stabilizing the people's livelihood in the rear can be achieved. There is no need to create new economic policies or seek other economic systems. Therefore, we dare to say that this meeting should focus on reviewing the degree of implementation of the previous proposal, making revised proposals that adapt to the environment and facilitate implementation, and at the same time, making proposals to support the government in implementing the resolutions.</p>
<p>We have always believed that improving people's livelihood and stabilizing people's livelihood are the most important goals of government economic measures. Only when people's lives are stable can materials be supplied continuously to adapt to total war participation. Of course, what we call the economic policies to stabilize people's livelihood is not some magical remedy that needs to be sought from famous mountains. The published policy outline is already quite perfect. As long as the various departments responsible for implementation and promotion can exert their leadership capabilities, proceed step by step, follow the order, cooperate with each other, and help each other, there will definitely be progress day by day and harvest piece by piece. If the policy is announced and the meeting is held, and that's the end of it, then the words on paper will always be words on paper, and they will not change even after thousands of years, let alone four months.</p>
<p>Based on what we have seen and heard in the past four months, based on the wartime economic policy outline, and with the goal of stabilizing the minimum standard of living, we would like to briefly express our views on economic measures as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Increasing production is, from any point of view, the most important point in the current economic problem. Plans for increasing agricultural production should be formulated by region and implemented as soon as possible. The improvement of seeds, the use of new agricultural tools, and the guidance of cultivation techniques must be carried out practically from the lower levels of rural areas. Rural loans should start with rural surveys. The Bank of Communications is already carrying this out, but the strength of one bank cannot be universal. Banks like the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, with its large amount of capital, should take a long-term view and do things that are beneficial to the country and the people, organize an agricultural loan group, and handle it jointly to build up real strength. Here, of course, the aim is to help farmers increase production, not to buy up land and create big landlords. In addition, areas such as the drought-stricken provinces of North China are in urgent need of seeds, so efforts must be made to provide relief to prevent continuous crop failures and increase the suffering of the people. On the industrial production side, overall planning is also needed. Military supplies and essential civilian goods must be fully increased in production, and raw material supply and transportation convenience must be taken into account. In particular, the unreasonable situation of power supply should be adjusted urgently. For example, factories producing daily necessities are affected by power restrictions, even though they have plans to increase production and have raw materials and labor. However, entertainment venues, which are purely consumption-oriented, do not have power supply difficulties. If this can be shifted from the latter to the former, the benefit of increased production of daily necessities can be reaped on the one hand, and the waste of consumption can be reduced on the other hand. If such unreasonable phenomena can be completely and thoroughly adjusted from the economic perspective of the interests of the country and the people, it is believed that it will be of great benefit to stabilizing people's livelihood and contributing to the war effort.</p>
<p>(2) Stabilizing the currency value is also the most worthwhile and necessary thing to do in the current stage of economic problems. We are not saying that there is any instability in the current currency value. At the last economic conference, there were rumors in the market that the government would issue new currency. After Minister Zhou clarified this, the rumors subsided. Not long ago, there were rumors in the market again that the Central Reserve Bank would issue 500-yuan notes. The announcement of the revised law of the Central Reserve Bank proved that there was no such provision, and the rumors were false. All these rumors, although fabricated out of thin air, were self-disturbing. However, from the standpoint of the people, we must also calmly calculate the trend of the purchasing power of money. Not to mention since the exchange of old currency in June last year, even after January this year, it can no longer be said to be normal. However, although the formation of this trend is not simple, and the cycle of rising prices is already a common perception, this perception has evolved to the point where it can no longer be remedied by justification and explanation, but must be corrected by facts. That is, currency policy and price policy must have a close and mutually supportive relationship.</p>
<p>(3) Prices, needless to say, are the most important issue for people's livelihood. Since the last economic conference, the National General Association for Commercial Control has been established, intending to use controlled economy and unblocked materials as means to achieve the goal of suppressing and stabilizing prices. Designating major commodities for registration first, allowing them to be transported first, grasping materials, unblocking materials, and distributing materials has not yet been realized. In addition, hoarding and speculation were originally a cause of rising prices. During this period, the government also ordered a thorough investigation and organized a Materials Investigation Committee. The Municipal Economic Bureau also has a valuation agency established. Measures for materials and prices seem to be under active discussion. However, when we observe the facts, the prices in shop windows are increasing month by month, and in the recent days, they have been surging again, especially for yarn and cloth. Here, we hope that the relevant authorities will pay close attention to this issue and jointly seek effective containment measures. It is not appropriate to let it go naturally, and it is even more against the wishes of the people to observe and shirk responsibility from each other.</p>
<p>We really have no lofty opinions, but when we think of the future of people's livelihood, we are worried. Reviewing our past statements, we have made multi-faceted considerations on the issue of prices, saying it again and again, but today's facts are still the same, which increases our shame of silence. Therefore, what we want to sincerely contribute to the gentlemen of the National Economic Conference today is only the two sentences "review the old and know the new" and "emphasize implementation". What is recorded today is still what was said yesterday, that is the truth; what is said today will be implemented tomorrow, that is practical work.</p>

<h3>Follow-up Report by Japanese Reporters in North China: Chairman Wang Talks About the Current Situation in China</h3>
<p>Beijing, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Beijing Japanese Reporters Group recently went to Central China for inspection. When they were in Nanjing, Chairman Wang kindly received them and briefly talked about the current situation in China. The main points are summarized as follows: (1) "The Rise of Political Consciousness": The Supreme National Defense Council decided on the Outline of Wartime Cultural Propaganda on June 10. The purpose is to mobilize the national cultural and ideological circles to raise the wartime consciousness of completing the Greater East Asia War. In the future, we will rectify thoughts and train the people's wartime life according to this outline. (2) "The National Government and the North China Political Affairs Committee Under the National Government": The Executive Yuan of the National Government is responsible for the administration of the directly administered areas. The administration of the northern provinces and cities is the responsibility of the North China Political Affairs Committee. What the central government expects from the North China Political Affairs Committee is to take the same steps in politics, economy, culture, and other aspects in accordance with the central government's intentions to complete the Greater East Asia War. (3) "Cleansing the Countryside": The work of cleansing the countryside has been promoted for two years, and the common areas have gradually expanded. Currently, we are planning to promote the security range to the northern Jiangsu region and the northern Hangzhou region. In the past, the work and administration of the cleansed areas were the responsibility of the Cleansing Committee, but recently it has been changed to be directly under the command of the Executive Yuan, in order to thoroughly penetrate political power. (4) "Movements of the Chongqing Side": The elements of the Chongqing side are three, namely its direct line army, miscellaneous army, and the people. The first type of Chongqing's direct line army, such as Hu Zongnan, currently has 600,000 troops, but has not fought the Japanese army once. They falsely believe that the United Kingdom and the United States will eventually win, and even if they do not win, they will not fail, so they continue to engage in useless resistance. The second type of miscellaneous army was originally opposed to Chiang Kai-shek, but they still lack understanding of the fact that the National Government is a powerful and trustworthy government, so they still follow Chongqing Chiang's orders to engage in resistance. If they accurately understand the National Government's concept of peaceful nation-building, they will surely come to participate in the peace movement. As for the third type of people, they have long been deeply disgusted with Chongqing Chiang's exploitation, but they lack the strength to actively carry out large-scale opposition movements. Under this situation, the reasons why the Chongqing side can maintain its position are three: first, the Chongqing side has food and self-sufficient rural areas; second, it sacrifices the people to ensure the army, especially the Chongqing direct line army, and its strength has not been excessively consumed; third, it receives various material assistance from the United Kingdom and the United States, and actively publicizes to prevent the people's hearts from being scattered. In short, we should not expect the Chongqing side to collapse on its own, but should increase the strength of the National Government and absorb the Chongqing army to actively promote the collapse of the Chongqing side.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Tani Convenes Army and Navy Commanders to Discuss Recovering the Shanghai International Settlement and Visits Foreign Minister Chu to Discuss Everything</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) – In order to practice the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty and respect China's independence and autonomy, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo has delivered a policy speech at the 82nd Diet session, explaining the beliefs of the Japanese government to the inside and outside, and expressing his determination to strengthen close cooperation with China, and further seek to fundamentally revise the Sino-Japanese Treaty. After the disclosure of this speech, not only the countries of East Asia are paying close attention, but also our entire country, both government and the public, are extremely welcome. This is indeed a powerful manifestation of the friendly nation Japan's sincere assistance to us. Recently, Japanese Ambassador to China Tani Masaki, who returned from Japan to take office, passed through Shanghai on the way and was accompanied by Minister Tianjiri to meet with Mayor Chen. The two sides exchanged views frankly on the issue of recovering the Shanghai International Settlement. The result of the conversation was extremely satisfactory. After Ambassador Tani returned to Beijing, he convened the local army and navy commanders at the embassy on the 24th to discuss the above issues. The results of the discussion were also quite good. It is expected that the recovery of the Shanghai International Settlement is not far away. This is indeed a glorious page in the history of Sino-Japanese friendship, and it is also what the entire nation of our country is eagerly seeking.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Ambassador to China Tani Masaki has returned to his country to report on his work and has reached a complete agreement with the government authorities on various issues concerning the new policy towards China. The ambassador arrived in Shanghai on the 20th.

The list of Chinese and Japanese members has been appointed by the competent authorities. For the convenience of work, the two sides will jointly work in Shanghai. In the future, the Chinese and Japanese sides will adopt the method of proceeding separately. All areas under the jurisdiction of the French Concession, the International Settlement, and the municipal government will be strictly investigated. Once hoarding is discovered, the Materials Investigation Committee will set an appropriate price to purchase it.

<h3>Vice Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Food Talks About Food Issues</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) – A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Zhou Naiwen, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Food, the day before yesterday to inquire about the government authorities' measures for food for the people during the time of year when the old grain is running out and the new grain has not yet been harvested, the harvest of the wheat season this year, and the distribution of flour and other issues soon. Vice Minister Zhou answered in detail one by one, and the details are recorded as follows: (1) The wheat in various parts of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui has generally been harvested this year, but there was slightly more rain during the harvest season, and the harvest was slightly inferior. On average, it is estimated that the wheat harvest in Central China this season is more than 80%. As for North China, the food situation this year is also expected to be a good harvest. (2) In previous years, every time the old grain ran out and the new grain had not yet been harvested, there was always a food panic. Now it is that time again. The Ministry is responsible for not shirking its responsibility because of the difficulties, and is still urging its internal and external subordinates to try to remedy the situation. On the active side, it is searching for rice and grain as much as possible to supplement a large amount of flour and wheat. On the passive side, it is persuading people to conserve consumption, strengthening anti-smuggling, and preventing outflow. In short, the difficulties can be overcome. (3) Flour is also a major food item. How to collect and distribute it uniformly is being planned and implemented by the National General Association for Commercial Control. The Ministry of Food has now estimated the amount needed for distribution and sent it to the Commercial Control Association for review. How to sell it in various places in the future still needs to be carefully considered.</p>

According to the new agreement, the resumption of work is conditional on placing all coal mines under the management of the government (represented by Ickes).

<p>Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington report: US coal mine owners have sent a letter to the Wartime Labor Board, requesting that the mines be returned to them.

<h3>Martial Law in Detroit Extended for 24 Hours</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a Michigan report: Detroit, the center of the American automobile industry, which has been under martial law for the past few days due to serious riots between black and white residents, saw a thousand foremen at the Rose River plant of the Bland Company go on strike yesterday afternoon in sympathy with the sixty-odd workers who were fired for striking last week. At the same time, President Roosevelt announced that he intended to ask Congress to raise the military service age limit to 65 in order to curb strikes. Federal troops immediately rushed to the Rose River plant to suppress the strike after a spokesman for the Ford Company said there was some disturbance in the factory. Roosevelt said that his action was intended to prevent any interruption in the work of factories and coal mines owned or operated by the government. Before the coal miners' strike was resolved, the government had taken steps to establish an organization to force all coal miners who were absent from work without cause to join the army. The actions of the leaders of the US Mine Workers' Union are intolerable and have aroused the indignation and hatred of the majority of people in the country. At the same time, according to a Washington report, the recent racial unrest, including the Detroit riots, will be publicly tried next week. The state of martial law in Detroit has been extended for 24 hours by the Governor of Michigan. Black and white workers are now working together to investigate the ringleaders of the riots.

<h3>Italy Calls Up People to Participate in Wartime Labor Service</h3>
<p>Rome, 24th (Central News Agency) - The Havas Agency reports that an Italian newspaper published an article yesterday explaining the reasons for the authorities' call-up of the 18th class of people to participate in wartime labor service during this period. The main reason is that a large number of munitions workers who were exempted from military service and soldiers on temporary leave have now been recalled to the military by the military authorities. At the same time, officials in military organs who are suitable for working on the front lines have also been transferred to the front lines. Therefore, there is a sudden shortage of workers in domestic production and management organs, so it is necessary to call up their personnel to supplement them. The authorities take into account the family responsibilities of the women who are called up, so women with complicated family affairs or who are breastfeeding will be exempted from service.</p>

<h3>German Reinforcements Arrive in Greece to Strengthen Southeast European Defenses, Rommel Appointed Commander of Southern French Defenses, British and American Psychological Warfare Against Turkey Intensifies</h3>

This German reinforcement, like two years ago, has transported its 400-horsepower tanks to Salonica in order to strengthen the defensive line in southeastern Europe.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - The Havas Agency reports: Regarding the Mediterranean theater, although there is not much new news at present, the military authorities in Berlin are paying close attention to developments in that area. The impression here is that the silence in the Mediterranean region is gradually coming to an end. The extent of the anti-Axis forces' activities in that area known to the German side has not yet been revealed, and no announcement has been made regarding the anti-Axis report that the German army has sent reinforcements to the Mediterranean, but military authorities here ensure that the German army will assist the Italian army in repelling any enemy attacks.</p>
<p>Ankara, 24th (Central News Agency) - The Havas Agency reports: Measures taken on the Turkish-Syrian border and rumors of the severance of diplomatic relations between France and Turkey are all manifestations of the British carrying out psychological warfare against Turkey in the Eastern Mediterranean. People here believe that the reported visit of British land and air forces to the Near East is a routine visit and does not involve any military measures to be implemented immediately. Regarding the possibility of this military action, there have been several contradictory rumors in Syria, but the conclusion is that any large-scale military action based in the Levant is difficult to implement at present, but action against the Dodecanese Islands (Italian-owned islands in the southern Aegean Sea) is still possible. If put into practice, its psychological significance is more important than its military effect.</p>

<h3>German-Soviet Front Lines Stand in Tense Standoff</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from a Correspondent in the Vicinity of Kuibyshev on the 20th) June 22 marks the second anniversary of the outbreak of the German-Soviet War. During these two years, the command of operations has sometimes been in the hands of the Germans and sometimes in the hands of the Soviets, with extreme changes, and neither side has achieved decisive results. Summer is favorable to the Germans, while winter is favorable to the Soviets. The German-Soviet War has passed in this situation for two years.</p>
<p>Air Force Begins to Become Active</p>
<p>Last summer, the German army swept through the vast area of the Don River, the Kuban River, the northern Caucasus region, and the Kalmuk steppes, reaching Stalingrad and arriving on the banks of the Volga River, the Soviet Union's artery. However, after winter came, the Red Army turned to the offensive, regaining Stalingrad, the Don River region, the Kalmuk steppes, and the northern Caucasus, and breaking into the Donets region and recovering Kharkov. There, it encountered the German army's counter-attack, abandoned Kharkov, and retreated to the east bank of the Donets River again. April and May were spent by both sides in preparing for battle, and the Eastern Front was temporarily calm. However, since the beginning of May, the activities of the German and Soviet air forces have gradually become more active. The Soviet Air Force began long-range bombing of East Prussia, Poland, and western Ukraine, while the German Air Force concentrated on bombing the transportation network in the front-line areas of Rostov, Bataisk, Krasnodar, and Kursk. As a result, the Soviet Air Force also stopped long-range bombing and turned to bombing German transport facilities and troop and material concentration points in the front-line area. By June, the reciprocal bombings became more intense, with the German Air Force attacking the skies over the upper and middle reaches of the Volga River, attacking Gorky and Yaroslavl, and bombing Saratov.</p>
<p>Which Side Will Strike First?</p>
<p>As such, the situation on the Eastern Front is extremely tense. The question now is which side will begin large-scale military operations first, and when and where. The German army began operations on the Kerch Peninsula on May 8 last year, and on May 10, in order to contain the Soviet army, it turned to an offensive in the Kharkov area. According to the Soviet Information Bureau, this counter-offensive only succeeded in preventing the German army from attacking Rostov, and the German army launched a strong attack on Sevastopol in early June, and in mid-June, it turned to an offensive in Kupyansk, east of Kharkov. By the end of June, the German offensive aimed at Valoniz had reached its peak. This year, June is fast approaching, but the Eastern Front has not yet begun large-scale operations like last year. It is likely that it is too late. How should this situation be explained? Because the winter war continued for a long time, it was necessary to spend a considerable amount of time to complete the necessary preparations for the next offensive. This may be one reason. The general Soviet public believes that the reason why the Eastern Front has not started large-scale operations is because the British and Americans have opened a second front. Recently, the battle situation in the Orel and Kupyansk areas has gradually become more active, so considerable attention has been paid to it. The German and Soviet armies both claim that this is only a local battle. Looking at the overall situation on the Eastern Front, the current atmosphere of urgency seems to be reaching its peak. The German and Soviet Union are staring at each other, waiting for the changes in the world situation.</p>
<p>Although most Soviet people do not know which side will take the lead, they believe that large-scale operations on the Eastern Front are about to begin. Since Chairman Stalin issued a proclamation on May 1, Soviet newspapers have issued warnings to the Soviet army and the Soviet people, pointing out that Germany still has the military power to launch a major offensive.</p>
<p>The Focus Is on the Central Line</p>
<p>Looking at all the circumstances, the most likely place for an offensive to be launched this summer is the central region. In this area, the defensive battles of both sides are deep into each other, and their positions threaten each other. This will be the area where the German and Soviet Union are active. Both sides intend to launch their first decisive offensive from this location. From this point of view, the ground forces in this area have been quite active recently. Both the German and Soviet sides are targeting the transportation facilities and troop concentration points in this area for bombing, which is worthy of attention. Many people predict that the southern region of the Eastern Front will be the main battlefield. (Xiang: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun of June 21, Fourth Section)</p>
<h3>The Intensifying Air War on the Western Front: British and American Air Fleets Fiercely Attack German Industrial Centers; 135 Aircraft Lost</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 24th – Air warfare on the Western Front has recently intensified. The Allied Air Forces, mainly using the so-called “Flying Fortress” heavy bombers, launched large-scale air raids on western Germany on the nights of the 21st and 23rd, and the morning of the 22nd, indiscriminately bombing the steel industry centers in the Ruhr region. They also attacked the Marne region of France on the evening of the 23rd. The British Air Ministry announced on the 23rd that 37 aircraft were lost during the bombing of western Germany. Reuters also reported that the air raid was met with unprecedented fierce counterattacks from German fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns, which is evidence of the intensity of the air battle at the time. According to statistics from the German authorities, the Allied Air Forces lost 135 heavy bombers, including 28 "Flying Fortresses," with a loss of 1,700 crew members in the 24 hours from the morning of the 22nd to the morning of the 23rd. At the same time, German Air Force bomber squadrons also carried out large-scale retaliatory bombings of the British mainland, fiercely bombing the heavy industrial areas surrounding London, achieving significant results. According to a Reuters report on the 23rd, the cumulative number of German aircraft that raided the British mainland from January to June 19 this year reached 14,000.</p>

<h3>Jointly Operated Society to Distribute Rice: To Begin Next Month; Rationing Will Still Be Handled by the Original Agencies</h3>
<p>Since the transfer of rice distribution work for the Chinese to the Shanghai Rice and Grain Joint Operation Society by the Central China Rice and Grain Group, the society has been actively preparing everything in recent days. It is now known that the rice distribution work of the society will officially begin on July 1st.</p>
<p>Rice Sources Can Be Divided into Two Types</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the society yesterday, the source of rice for the Joint Operation Society can be divided into two types: one is foreign rice shipped to Shanghai from abroad, supplied by the Japanese Embassy, accounting for one-third of the total amount; the other is domestic rice, supplied by the Ministry of Food. This domestic rice is uniformly purchased by the Ministry of Food from rice-producing areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, accounting for two-thirds of the total amount. For the foreign rice, the embassy is responsible for a continuous supply. For the domestic rice, there is currently a surplus in other ports that can be shipped to Shanghai. Once the new rice harvest arrives in the autumn, the Ministry of Food will naturally purchase a large amount.</p>
<p>Focus of Work is Transportation and Distribution</p>
<p>From July 1st, the society will be responsible for the transportation and distribution of rice. The rice purchased by the Ministry of Food from the producing areas will be allocated to the society on a regular basis, and the society will find ways to transport it to Shanghai. The transportation of rice supplied by the embassy will also be the responsibility of the society. After the rice from both sources is gathered, the society will distribute it to the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Public Works Department, and the Municipal Food Bureau, and the above-mentioned agencies will then redistribute it to the member stores of the Joint Operation Society, which will then ration it to the citizens. Therefore, the Joint Operation Society does not directly undertake the rationing of rice; its main focus is on transportation and distribution. In effect, it can be regarded as an intermediary agency between the Ministry of Food and the agencies that handle the rationing of rice.</p>
<h3>Ting Yun Lou's Charity Exhibition for Education: Successful Outcome; Total Exceeds 300,000 Gold</h3>
<p>Shao Daren, the owner of Ting Yun Lou, organized a charity exhibition of fan paintings for education, gathering 2,000 exquisite works by famous calligraphers and painters from all over Shanghai. From the 22nd to yesterday, it was displayed at the Da Xin Gallery for charity sales. For three days, people flocked to visit and order paintings, reaching a temporary peak. The total amount of the charity sale exceeded 300,000 gold, which will be used entirely as educational aid funds for the Shen Bao and Xin Shen Bao newspapers after deducting expenses. Mr. Shao and the calligraphers and painters who participated in the charity exhibition, as well as people from all walks of life who came to bid, all contributed to the good cause with the kind intention of helping poor students, which is truly admirable. Once the settlement is completed, the exact amount will be announced publicly. This note expresses our gratitude.</p>
<p>Aid Received Yesterday: Yesterday, this newspaper received aid for education, totaling: Lu Ruifang 200 yuan, the Girls' Department of Aurora University Affiliated High School 170 yuan and 1 jiao, Shen Tianmin 100 yuan, Dai Cangqi (painting fan assistance) 20 yuan, Mr. Li 10 yuan, totaling 500 yuan and 0.01 jiao in savings certificates, with a balance of 461,786 yuan and 6 jiao and 9 fen.</p>
<h3>Civic Welfare Association Welcomes Ambassadors Ishisha and Senkyo</h3>
<p>For the visit of ambassadors Ishisha and Senkyo from friendly nations, the Shanghai Civic Welfare Association will hold a tea party at 5:00 PM this afternoon (the 25th) in the conference hall of the Industry and Commerce Association on the fourth floor of the Xing Ya Building, No. 12 on the Bund, inviting Chinese and Japanese officials and celebrities from all walks of life in the city to participate and socialize. Both individuals are outstanding figures in the Japanese diplomatic circle and have a deep understanding of Chinese issues. Their visit to China will undoubtedly make many contributions to promoting Sino-Japanese cooperation.</p>
<p>Ambassador Ishisha Speaks: Ishisha Idaye, the former Japanese Ambassador to Brazil, has arrived in Shanghai to inspect the situation in China. He met with reporters at the Broadway Mansion yesterday (the 24th) afternoon and discussed the situation in South America, centered on Brazil and Paraguay. He said that Brazil has now severed diplomatic relations with the Axis powers, but after the severance, the Brazilian Foreign Minister repeatedly explained to him that the rights and interests of Japanese diplomats and Japanese residents would not be hindered in any way. The staff of the Japanese Embassy enjoyed complete freedom of movement. However, from the severance of diplomatic relations in January to around March, they were placed under house arrest, and Brazil began to oppress Japanese residents and issued orders to suppress the Japanese, which angered them. However, Brazil's severance of diplomatic relations with the Axis powers or oppression of the Japanese was all instigated by the United States. Long before the war, there were US officials in the Brazilian intelligence agencies and police headquarters supervising the suppression of the Japanese. Brazil has no grievances against the Japanese, and some even celebrated the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor wholeheartedly, but because it is completely dependent on the United States economically, it had no choice but to be bound and constrained by the United States, hence the severance of diplomatic relations with the Axis powers. In addition, Argentina in South America is known as a naval power, while Brazil can be said to be an army power. In recent years, it has been actively expanding its military. Before the war, most of its armaments were purchased from Germany, but now it has to purchase them from the United States. Although Brazil's national wealth is relatively abundant, its government is extremely poor and has repeatedly borrowed huge sums of money from the United States. The United States skillfully uses a pincer-like restraint. This kind of intention of the United States is not only for Brazil alone, but also for all countries in Central and South America. At present, only Argentina still exists as a neutral country, but Argentina also has many situations and is generally unable to stand on its own. The United States is exerting great pressure on it, even the backstage person of the recent revolution, the price and the US</p>
<h3>The Material Investigation Committee: Investigation Officers' Offices Established; Investigations Conducted Separately by Chinese and Japanese Systems</h3>
<p>The Material Investigation Committee has decided to establish separate offices to handle the investigation work for the Chinese and Japanese sides. The Chinese and Japanese sides will each send six investigation officers. The Japanese side will be selected by the embassy and military authorities, while the Chinese side will consist of four members from the municipal government and two members from the Public Works Department. The investigation officers' offices have now been established and will soon begin work. Under the investigation officers of the committee, there will also be investigators. Except for the investigation of the Japanese side, which will be carried out by a system consisting of Japanese committee members, investigation officers, and investigators, the investigation work for the Chinese side will generally be carried out separately in the Public Concession, the French Concession, and other areas under the supervision of the relevant departments in the investigation office. The number of investigators required in each area will be jointly determined by the municipal government, the Public Works Department, the Board of Directors, and the Chamber of Commerce, and then they will be dispatched.</p>
<p>In addition, the Material Control Bureau of the Public Works Department, in order to understand the quantity of materials stored in various warehouses within the concession, has instructed the investigation section to investigate all warehouses within the concession, whether for business or private use, for statistical purposes. This investigation work has already been implemented. It is understood that the investigation of various business warehouses has been completed, and the investigation of private warehouses is now underway. Once the investigation is completed, a list of various materials will be published.</p>

<h3>Gold Prices and Commodity Prices</h3>
<p>— Derson</p>
<p>Since 1931, when countries around the world successively abandoned the gold and silver standard and entered the paper currency standard or managed currency standard, gold has no longer been used as a material for a country's monetary system. In theory, the price of gold should have fallen. However, because gold is a rare and valuable item, the price of gold not only did not fall, but actually rose sharply, and gold prices continue to have a significant impact on commodity prices, as they always have.</p>
<p>During wartime, a country seeks military victory abroad and social and economic stability at home. To achieve social stability, the first step is to stabilize commodity prices, because commodity prices are most closely related to people's livelihoods. Looking at all the warring countries, they all strictly control, ration, and supervise commodity prices. Since gold price fluctuations have such a huge impact on commodity prices, the highest authorities of a country invariably control or reclaim gold as national property during wartime, fearing that a sharp rise in gold prices would affect the country's entire financial system.</p>
<p>Looking back at the Shanghai financial market, since the war, gold has never been controlled or reclaimed as national property, allowing it to rise and fall freely. This has had a strong impact on commodity prices and has been very harmful to the general public. Although the rise in general commodity prices is also due to reasons such as scarcity of sources, inconvenience of transportation, increased costs, hoarding, and speculation, speculative merchants always use the sharp rise in gold prices as the biggest reason for raising commodity prices. Therefore, strictly controlling gold prices is a necessary measure for warring countries. Although the authorities have issued policies to change their past free-floating policy on gold prices and imposed price limits, first of 3,000 yuan and then of 5,000 yuan, so that it cannot be used as an excuse for price increases and to stabilize people's livelihoods, in the black market, people are just paying lip service and are acting against the regulations, eventually exceeding the price limits. This has led to a steady rise in commodity prices in recent days, with no end in sight, causing suffering to the people. The authorities will certainly not sit idly by in the face of such insane actions. The author believes that if the authorities can further control gold prices or prohibit its trading, and even promulgate measures for nationalizing gold, the adverse phenomenon of gold prices affecting commodity prices will not recur today.</p>
<h3>The General Commercial Control Association Will Begin Real Control Activities; It Will Supervise and Guide, but Not Directly Engage in Buying and Selling</h3>
<p>The National General Commercial Control Association has completed the organization of the following subordinate industry associations: the six industry associations under the Grain Section, including the Coarse Grains Industry Association, the Flour Industry Association, the Animal Husbandry Industry Association, the Egg Industry Association, the Sugar Industry Association, and the Edible Oil Industry Association; and the thirteen industry associations under the Industrial Section, including the Coal Industry Association, the Cotton Products Industry Association, the Soap and Candle Industry Association, the Tobacco Industry Association, the Match Industry Association, the General Merchandise Industry Association, the Alcohol Industry Association, the Leather Industry Association, the Silk Industry Association, the Chemical Industry Association, the Financial Industry Association, the Glass Industry Association, and the Electrical Appliance Industry Association.  The three associations for Wool Textiles, Cotton, and Rubber are also expected to be established soon.  The four specialized committees for Flour and Wheat, Cotton, Sugar, and Edible Oil have also been established.  Therefore, it has been decided to begin activities next month, handling: (1) the purchase and allocation of controlled materials; (2) the exchange and operation of materials across domestic regions; (3) the supply of export materials; (4) the allocation of import materials; (5) the procurement of military and electrical materials and other matters designated or entrusted by the responsible department. The principle is to supervise and guide, without directly engaging in the buying and selling of materials.</p>
<h3>The Central Reserve Bank Stipulates Methods for Clearing Checks of Chinese Banks</h3>
<p>C. Payment: (1) All payments from clearing banks to depositors must be made by issuing fund transfer orders. (2) Each evening, this bank will collect all fund transfer orders received from each bank, compile them separately, calculate the total amount, and send them to each bank the following morning for cancellation and exchange with deposit slips and checks, to be used to pay each bank's "Clearing Account." D. Cash Withdrawal: (1) If a clearing bank needs to withdraw cash due to its own needs or at the request of a depositor, it should still issue a fund transfer order, but must note "Please Pay Cash" on the back and affix an official seal. This fund transfer order must be cancelled separately on the same day. E. Returned Checks: (1) Returned checks after clearing between clearing banks will be sent by each bank to the Bankers' Association for forwarding to the bank that originally issued the check. The Bankers' Association will issue a temporary receipt to the returning bank, which will exchange it for an official receipt from the paying bank. The amount listed on the receipt will be credited to each bank's "Clearing Account." (2) Temporary receipts obtained by clearing banks from the Bankers' Association due to returned checks must be submitted to this bank before 11:00 AM the next morning to be credited to the next day's account, with interest calculated from that day. If the deadline is missed, the returned check amount will be combined with the receipts of the following day and interest will be calculated from the day after that. (3) For the return of the amount of returned checks from other clearing banks, each clearing bank should issue an interbank check payable to this bank and submit it to the Bankers' Association for deposit into the Association's "Clearing Account," while simultaneously paying the accounts of each bank. (4) For the return of the amount of returned checks from entrusted collection, if the collection was entrusted to the Bankers' Association, an interbank check payable to this bank should be issued and submitted to the Bankers' Association.

<h3>Trend of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks first fell and then rebounded, initially due to news of a sharp drop in gold prices, but later boosted by both new and old investors.  Most stocks rose more than they fell.  Judging from the sentiment of various parties, there was still a bearish trend amidst the confusion.  In the cultural sector, the Business and Commercial Press and the Chinese Pharmaceutical Bookstore reached new highs amidst constant buying pressure, while the World Bookstore remained unchanged.  Among public utilities, the Zhabei Water and Electricity and China General Edison Company stocks continued to rise sharply.  The Great China Match Company reached a new high again, while the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company tended to be stagnant and flat.  Textile stocks showed mixed results, with Wing On Textile and the Dasheng No. 1 and No. 3 factories seeing declines, while Rongfeng, Guoyan, and Tongji mostly progressed upwards.  The Great China Weaving Factory even reached a high of one and a half yuan again.  In the department store sector, Wing On fell by several yuan, while Sincere and China Emporium rose.  Jinglun and Jingfu shirt and sock stocks experienced little supply for considerable demand.  Hongxing Hosiery Factory's low price attracted buying pressure, causing it to rise.  New pharmaceutical stocks rose and then returned to flat as before.  Kang Yuan Canning Company experienced a shortage of supply.  Sin-yi Land was stagnant and flat.  Jiu An Industrial was traded at the border, and the communication easiness trust remained at the previous price.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Government Bonds:  The unofficial market for unified government bonds rose and then fell back, with no significant gains or losses for bond types A, B, C, D, and E.</p>
<p>Gold and Silver:  Jewelry gold at the Da Hsin and Tong Hsing jewelry stores in this city was sold at the limited price, but the handling fees increased repeatedly with market conditions.  There was no actual market price among traders, and off-market transactions were weak.  Prices rose and then fell, but the final result still exceeded six whole numbers.  The listed price of sycee silver remained unchanged, and the off-market price was the same as before.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>Tobacco Bank Granted Exemption from Penalty:  The China Tobacco Bank, due to delays in submitting required reserves for demand deposits, proposed remedial measures and made repeated requests, resulting in a delay.  The assistant director of the inspection bureau telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting a fine of 5,000 yuan.  After receiving the document, the bank truthfully explained the situation to the Ministry of Finance and requested the revocation of the penalty.  It is reported that the bank has now received a reply from the Ministry of Finance granting the exemption.</p>
<p>Honey and Candied Fruit Industry Association Established Yesterday: The Shanghai District Honey and Candied Fruit Industry Association was officially established yesterday.

At the first joint meeting of directors and supervisors, many important matters were approved, and active progress was made in all aspects of the association's affairs.</p>
<h3>Provisional Regulations for Provincial and Municipal Banks; National Government Revises Article 6</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 24th Central News Agency Telegram: The National Government orders (June 24, Year 32): The amended Article 6 of the Provisional Regulations for Provincial and Municipal Banks is hereby promulgated. This order.</p>
<p>Amended Article 6 of the Provisional Regulations for Provincial and Municipal Banks (Promulgated on June 24, Year 32): Article 6. The capital of a provincial or municipal bank must reach at least six million national currency, which shall be allocated by the provincial government's Department of Finance or the municipal government's Bureau of Finance. It may also draft a share prospectus and, after submitting it for approval, solicit commercial shares. However, the total amount of commercial shares shall not exceed forty-nine percent of the total capital. Shareholders of the aforementioned commercial shares shall be recruited primarily from those who are registered in the province or who have property and residence within the province or municipality. If there is a shortfall, additional shareholders may be recruited outside the business area, and shareholders shall be limited to those with Republic of China nationality. The aforementioned share capital may be paid in two installments. If there is still a need to increase the capital after the full amount has been collected, the local government may submit a request to the Ministry of Finance for approval.</p>
<h3>The General Commercial Control Association and Sino-Japanese Economic Relations (3)</h3>
<p>Regarding the economic relationship between China and Japan, there is much talk of cooperation and mutual support, but it is not easy to truly understand the underlying realities of the Chinese economy.  It is necessary to understand that Chinese economy is fundamentally different in its division from the Japanese economy. However, among the diverse and confusing opinions, there are few who can truly understand the core issues and grasp the actual situation of the Chinese economy in their efforts.  This is due to the prejudices and misunderstandings on both sides.  If both sides can face the situation squarely, the question of whether it is appropriate for Japanese personnel not to participate in the central leadership of the General Commercial Control Association can be clarified. At that time, it will be understood that we have no reason to retreat. Consequently, we can clearly identify our goals and move forward bravely.  The Chinese side should also understand the great significance of the phrase "living and dying together" and use the adjustment of interests between the Chinese and Japanese business communities to come to a mutual understanding.  Then, the erroneous consciousness of recovering national rights will be dispelled, and the close cooperation between Chinese and Japanese economic actors can be promoted through the work of the General Commercial Control Association.  We are confident that this will inevitably reveal an unprecedentedly bright future.</p>
<p>Some say that the inevitability of the General Commercial Control Association's birth lies in China's autonomous participation in the war. In fact, this is not necessarily a correct view. I believe that since we already know that China is a country within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, then no matter how much Chiang Kai-shek relies on the United States and Britain to resist Japan, we cannot say that it is not a country within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, whether China likes it or not, it is naturally designated as a country within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, the inevitable existence of countries within the Co-Prosperity Sphere is the inevitable reason for the birth of the General Commercial Control Association. This understanding is correct.

<h3>"New Life" and "Corruption"</h3>
<p>— Zhao Xiang</p>
<p>Old age is venerable, while youth is lovely?</p>
<p>The youth period is a period of breaking away from the foolishness, immaturity, and ignorance of childhood, while still maintaining innocence, frankness, and purity. It is neither infected with the sentimentality that some middle-aged people are prone to, nor does it carry the air of decline of general older people. Like a sharp blade freshly sharpened, the ardent emotions contain boiling red blood, and the whole body is full of vitality. The fire of life is burning fiercely like a hurricane, advancing vigorously towards the goal, never thinking of shrinking, fear, or avoiding…</p>
<p>This kind of youthful vitality is truly the loveliness of youth!</p>
<p>The times bestow significant responsibilities on youth, and the country and society place deep expectations on youth.</p>
<p>Ardent pursuit of knowledge, steadfast loyalty to truth; ability to humbly accept teachings, ability to rigorously criticize; cultivation of generous virtues, creation of good habits; respectful manners; strong physique; freedom from the current bad habits; heroic, capable, and motivated - this is truly the loveliness of youth!</p>
<p>Among the gray-haired elders are antiques, which are not worth respecting; but among the fair-skinned and handsome youths, there are also "remnants of the past dynasty." While their age is in the prime of youth, and their demeanor is elegant and refined, their spirits have already been corrupted. Suffering from "premature aging," they are muddled and foolish in their daily lives, their speech is illogical and decadent, their actions are absurd and deviated, and they are unlearned and unskilled, no different from walking corpses. This kind of youth is outside of the category of loveliness!</p>
<p>As there are sterile grains among rice and weeds among crops, not every youth is excellent and lovely. Among pure, striving, and upward-looking youths, one must be careful of weevils and traitors lurking within. However, the formation of sterile grains is related to irrigation and fertilizer; only weeds are inherently inferior. Moreover, humans are not made of wood or stone, and there are no born slaves. The drifting of youth into vulgarity and corruption has various reasons, and it does not happen overnight. Youth should also have this self-awareness and self-admonishment, and should not become those who are abandoned by the times.</p>
<h3>Alas! Worldly Wisdom?</h3>
<p>— Yan Weisheng</p>
<p>The proverb says, "Learn a lesson from every loss." There is no such thing as "instant success, instant achievement." The more nails are hit, the more experience one accumulates. Of course, one becomes more "worldly wise" about human relationships and the ways of the world.</p>
<p>Indeed, the more "worldly wise" one becomes, the closer one gets to the realm of success, which is undeniable. But unfortunately, many worldly wise people do not always develop "cleverness and competence" to seek advancement in promising careers. Instead, their worldly wisdom strengthens their ability to plot and flatter. Success gives them a numb feeling towards human relationships and the ability to use unscrupulous means. This is truly a case of "cleverness being ruined by cleverness," becoming a "cunning old fox." They believe that they can always "handle things with ease" and "be all things to all people" to gain some advantages, but they do not realize that their "achievements" have reached their limit. Sooner or later, they will be despised, their reputation will be ruined, and their promising future will be destroyed.</p>
<h3>How Do People in Iron Lungs Procreate?</h3>
<p>— Nan Ren</p>
<p>Reports say that a person in an iron lung is going to have a child again. Everyone who reads this news must have doubts. He sleeps in an iron lung all year round, and at most can only leave for a few minutes. How can he get married? How can he procreate? Isn't this a question? Perhaps his marriage is only in terms of formalities, and conception is probably done artificially? This is completely wrong.</p>
<p>Since returning to his country, the person in the iron lung still cannot leave the iron lung. He cannot breathe if he leaves it because his respiratory nerves are damaged. He cannot survive without the iron lung.</p>
<p>His father, Shi Lide, is an American copper and iron magnate, a famous wealthy man with countless millions of assets. He only had this one treasured son. If he is always confined to this iron lung, isn't his father the same as not having a son? Who will he pass on all this wealth to in the future? This psychology is probably the same for all humanity! So his father said: Find the most famous doctors and scientific experts to solve this problem, how to leave the iron lung, and how to get married, etc.</p>
<p>After careful research by many experts, they came up with a solution. It is fundamentally impossible to leave the iron lung, but he can't breathe, and other than that, he is very healthy. You can't limit all his freedoms for one part of his lung is damaged. So, the iron lung, which is like a boiler in the boiler room of a small fire boat, was shrunk down to the size of a copper wire vest worn by policemen.</p>
<p>Since the person in the iron lung wore this breathing vest, it has been much easier. He can sit up, he can walk, and of course, he can get married, so he can procreate. Science is omnipotent, and it is so great for the happiness of mankind! (Donation for Scholarship Fund)</p>
<h3>Li Lihua's Words</h3>
<p>— Lao Yu</p>
<p>The summer sun shone on the earth. I rushed from the office to Lane Lian, Avenue Joffre to visit the "Um" girl, Li Lihua.</p>
<p>Fortunately, when I walked into the living room, I saw Li Lihua writing a letter at the table. When she noticed my footsteps, she quickly tore up the letter, crumpled it into a ball, and threw it into the spittoon. She immediately stood up, with the same lively attitude of a sweet girl, smiling, and invited me to sit down. She took out a cigarette, took a few puffs, and I asked her first:</p>
<p>"Miss Li, how busy have you been recently? The stage scenes of 'Ten Thousand Purples and Thousands of Reds' are said to be very grand. Can you tell me about it?"</p>
<p>"Busy, of course, goes without saying. I'm filming all day long at the studio. After filming, I have to learn to play the piano, sign autographs for fans, and write letters back to fans. I'm really exhausted. For the past half month, I've been filming 'Ten Thousand Purples and Thousands of Reds' every day. The song and dance scenes in that new film are even grander than those in 'Lingbo Fairy' that I filmed before," she replied.</p>
<p>"Then how many kinds of songs and dances will you be performing?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I can't name them. I can only say that there are many varieties."</p>
<p>"Are there any members of my Girl Scout troop participating this time?"</p>
<p>"I remember that the most recent time we filmed a song and dance scene, there were more than thirty people."</p>
<p>"Where were the outdoor scenes for 'Ten Thousand Purples and Thousands of Reds' filmed?"</p>
<p>"Just last Monday, from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM, we filmed the outdoor scenes at Zhaofeng Park. The scenery was very good, and we shot more than twenty shots."</p>
<p>"I'm filming this one very seriously. When it's released in the future, I hope everyone will give me a lot of pointers." "You're welcome."</p>
<p>"Have you seen any news about me in the newspapers these days?"</p>
<p>"There's a lot of news. We're going to drink your wedding wine."</p>
<p>"The newspapers are always making fun of me. It's really inexplicable!" She pouted her little mouth, looking a little angry.</p>
<p>"Well, there must be some reason. People are saying that you're going to get married. This doesn't seem to be just a rumor." "Oh, I'm still young, how can I talk about such things? Please don't believe these rumors. I can honestly say that marriage is something no one can escape, but I think of marriage as a family prison, which even affects personal freedom. I'm now dedicated to the silver screen. Filming is very tiring, but it's very enjoyable in spirit. Do you agree?" She hugged her knees with both hands, looked at me with squinted eyes, and said a series of serious words playfully.</p>
<p>"Okay, I understand. Let's talk about filming. What is your latest film, Miss Li?"</p>
<p>"I haven't decided yet. I'll probably talk about it after 'Autumn Begonia' is finished."</p>
<p>At this moment, a maid suddenly came in and said, "Miss, the Victory Record Company is calling and urging you to go record a record. They want you to go right away."</p>
<p>"Okay, I know."</p>
<p>"Well, I'll say goodbye then. Goodbye," I stood up and nodded to her.</p>
<p>"I'm really sorry, goodbye, Mr. ××," she also stood up and saw me out the door.</p>

<h3>Textile Industry Comrades Establish Improved Wooden Spinning Machine Training Institute</h3>
<p>— Yan Ming</p>
<p>The improved wooden spinning machine has been introduced to Shanghai for quite some time. This spring, only one company is manufacturing and selling them. Currently, there are several other places. From the perspective of sales, it seems that the wooden spinning machine can be promoted. However, after examining the actual situation, there are still many factories. The operation of the improved wooden spinning machine has entered a stage of mechanization, unlike the simplicity of the old style. Therefore, manufacturing spinning machines requires considerable mechanical knowledge and a thorough understanding of the principles of spinning. Only in this way can excellent spinning machines be produced. With excellent spinning machines, good yarn can be spun. "A workman must first sharpen his tools if he wishes to do his work well." This is what it means. The improved wooden spinning is suitable for cotton-producing areas where cotton is cheap and yarn is expensive. Currently, due to transportation difficulties and inconvenience, those engaged in wooden spinning machines often purchase a simplified spinning machine, and then imitate it after reaching their destination. Because the manufacturers lack a deep understanding, they often end up with a poor copy, and the mechanism is not accurate. Although the operation may be smooth, the result is often unsuitable for spinning. Therefore, some mistakenly believe that the mechanism is not working and become discouraged. This situation is actually enough to hinder the promotion of wooden spinning machines. Several textile comrades have established an improved wooden spinning machine training institute, so that those who want to engage in textile machines can have a deep understanding of the manufacture and use of wooden spinning machines in advance, and then operate. In this way, the application of wooden spinning machines can be promoted, and those engaged in spinning can understand the principles of the spinning mechanism, and there is a possibility for research and improvement. The institute is now located at the Shilu East Tiwen Middle School, Lane 363, Ningbo Road. The course is divided into primary and advanced levels. In addition, a special class is set up to teach small iron machine spinning. Registration starts at 1:00 pm every day. Those who are interested in learning from other places can also correspond.</p>
<h3>Disaster Situation in Chao-Shan</h3>
<p>— Su Ren</p>
<p>I have a relative who came to Suzhou from Chaoyang, and according to him, the actual situation in Chao-Shan is extremely severe. Since spring to summer this year, the Chaozhou-Shantou area has not had a single drop of rain. The weather is dry and the land is barren for thousands of miles. Prices have risen to hundreds of times. There are no harvests of beans, wheat, or miscellaneous grains. Wild grass and trees are scorched and withered, so that on average, dozens of people die from starvation every day. Some die in ditches, some by hanging, and some by drowning. The situation is unbearable. The price of rice in Chaoyang is more than 900 yuan per dou (unit of dry measure), and in the inland areas such as Pingxia Mountain, the price of rice is more than 600 yuan per dou. Sweet potatoes, which used to be used as pig feed, have risen to 40 or 50 yuan per catty, and sweet potato vines, which are used for fuel, have risen to more than 10 yuan per catty. Other goods are not only extremely expensive, but also impossible to buy.</p>
