<h3>實現戰時國民經濟生活</h3>
<p>目前世界戰爭是總力戰爭，其最後的勝負，不僅取決於雙方的前綫，而更重要的是取決於每個國民的勞力—特別是國民經濟生活之戰時形態。所以，不論爲日本爲德義，或爲蘇聯爲英美，都不得不盡一切最大的勞力，以求極度集中全國國力與資材，不得不要求和强迫全國國民忍受最大的犧牲和痛苦，由平時經濟生活狀態，進至戰時國民經濟生活狀態，庶幾節約國民的時間精神，與一切有生的和無生的力量，集中到國家政府的掌握之中，俾與戰爭的國策密切配合，爭取最後的勝利。</p>
<p>這種戰時國民經濟生活，在德國實行已有好幾年了，而且幾乎隨着戰爭之發展而更加緊張，更加嚴密，使國民日常生活，都配合着國家的要求，而不妄用一文錢財，浪費一分物資，積極的使自己的一舉一動都有利於國策之貫澈。但是政府還嫌不足，所以從一九四二—四三年的冬季以來，在郭培爾的倡導之下，又展開了全歐洲總動員的運動，以期軸心國領導下的歐洲各國國民，完全進入決戰準備的國民經濟生活狀態，以配合軸心國一九四三年的戰略，而爭取最後的勝利。</p>
<p>友邦日本，國民經濟生活進入戰鬥狀態，較之德國，有過之無不及，因此國家可以順利地集中支配全國的一切力量與資材，而進行「攻無不克」「所向無敵」的戰爭。然而，日本朝野還不以此爲滿足，還隨時要求國民一切力量之緊張與集中，要求國民戰時經濟生活之澈底實現，使無一絲一毫的力量之浪費。本月二十二日朝日新聞社論就明白指出：「日本戰時經濟政策的根本目標，就是如何使國民忍痛，如何使國民耐苦。」所以然者，「我日本爲了要戰勝經濟力絕對優越的英美，日本國民必須忍受比英美人民更多的戰時生活之犧牲，藉此挹注經濟力的不足。」</p>
<p>現在試問我們每一個國民的戰時生活如何？誠然，我們一向以「廣土衆民，物產豐饒」自負的，但是經過六年來的戰亂，再加渝共二政權之分割，天災匪患之消耗，老實說，中國的人口已經激减，中國的物產已經凋零，早已不再「地大物博了」。縱使不說建設新中國，協力東亞解放之戰，更保全國家民族的元氣，以求國民之甦復，已經大非易事了。雖然，目前友邦日本以平等待我，給我們以千載難逢的自拔自救的機會，然而，如果依然只知喊幾句漂亮動聽的口號，寫幾篇歌功頌德粉飾太平的文章，而上下泄沓，散漫如故，試問我們憑什麼資格與日德義列强講平等。而且，如果我們不乘此時機緊張起來，振作起來，對本國對東亞擔負起時代的使命，那麼，在將來，我們如何能立足於新世界；在今日，我們更有何顏面空言保衛後方協力前綫？</p>
<p>世界戰爭的決戰時期快要來臨，戰時國民經濟生活之全面的實施，已經迫不及待了。以日本國家動員工作之圓滿，以日本國民經濟生活之嚴整，而日本輿論界尤以對優越的英美作戰之艱苦，以警告其朝野，勸告國民忍痛犧牲，循着增加戰力之綫前進。我們樣樣落後於日本，而大家只會紙上談兵，都不願忍受精神肉體上的痛苦；甚至有不少人利用時機，投機囤積，恣意揮霍，盡情享樂，不僅與民富國强與東亞解放相距萬里，而且簡直是亡國滅種的現象。我們首先希望今日中央與地方高等官吏，立即猛省，人人有爲民表率之志。我們更希望社會領袖互相勸勉，領導羣衆。但是同時我們要指出，最大多數的中國人民，今日是在最低限度的生活水準之下掙扎着。因此，當局對於促進國民戰時經濟生活，使國民忍痛耐苦，一方面應該用勸導，警誡和鼓勵等方法，一方面更應隨時詳察民隱與不平，務求人人爲國家民族與東亞之解放而奮鬥，沒有人可以巧取豪奪，獨獲暴利。</p>
<p>綜括言之，戰時國民經濟生活，是全體國民共過着同其水準的生活。當然談不到享受與作樂，而忍受刻苦，必須平均與平等。對於生活資取，量方面務須平均；質方面務須平等。如果大多數人民已在最低限度生活下掙扎，而少數人還在盡情享用，那末，在道義上也是於心有愧，莫說還有貢獻於戰爭總力的大前提呢！所以實現戰時生活，應從「上層份子」自發自動始。</p>

<h3>晋南渝軍已趨崩潰　殘部將領續有歸順　魯蘇區陸戰隊司令朱子銘投誠　偷渡黃河侵入晋省渝軍被擊滅</h3>
<p>山西前綫二十六日中央社電　日軍於二十三日傍晚，曾在四家井附近俘虜渝軍第二十四集團軍幹部二百六十人，其中已查明者，計有冀察戰區獨立挺進第四一縱隊司令少將于光輝，及上校參謀楊志希武常恒等高級將校五十三人。又其他日軍部隊，于二十四日下午四時許，在臨洪西方四公里，渦陽城附近，亦俘虜渝新編第五軍部三百四十六人，其中亦有上校侯寬文等，高級軍官四十九人，故此次日軍在該方面展開之包圍殲滅戰，因渝新編第五軍長孫殿英之投降，該軍將領戰意已完全消失故其高級將校，乃先後被日軍所俘。</p>
<p>山西南部前綫二十五日電　此次日軍對渝第二十四集團軍之殲滅作戰，乃去年冀中戰後之一大新作戰。蓋自渝新編第五軍長孫殿英投誠後，日軍即自各方分頭進擊敵軍，致敵方將領續有投誠和運者，獲得極大之戰果。尤其當日軍對渝第二十四集團軍採取包圍行動時，事前極端保守秘密，故能一舉而完全包圍之，幷對盤踞於太行山脈峻險地帶梅氏鎭之渝第二十七軍予以十數次之急烈攻擊，敵軍不支，大部逃入山中，躱避日軍之鋒芒。此次作戰之結果，渝第四十五師長胡長靑陣亡，敵軍殆已全部潰滅，日軍之雷繫作戰，已入最後階段，刻日軍精銳，仍在追擊中。至此，華北殘存渝軍唯一之反攻企圖，悉成泡影。</p>
<p>太原廿六日中央社電　據晋南日軍前綫來電：渝軍約一萬，退至連接臨淇東南方南平及田家井，距離省境某若干公里之山岳地帶後，即爲日軍句圍，廿四日夜，日軍對之加以猛攻，至廿五日渝軍悟於抗戰之無益，乃陸續參加和運。渝方「第四十軍遊擊支隊」侯如席少將，宣佈參加和運後，臨洪西北方翟井方面渝軍「旅長」階級少將二名，（氏名不詳）亦率部參加和運。至是渝軍指揮系統大亂，其全面崩潰，僅爲時間問題。又據俘虜稱：渝方「第廿七軍第四十五師師長」胡長靑，（昨誤爲胡開靑）已於陵川附近之戰鬥中陣亡，「第四十軍第卅九師師長」崔玉洲，因恐懼日軍急襲，現仍徬徨山中。</p>
<p>太原廿六日中央社電　據晋冀豫省境日軍前綫訊，日軍自攻入渝軍據點臨洪北方地區後，渝「第五軍」之主力，已潰向臨淇西方之山地中逃竄，但渝「第三師」及「第四師」之一部，已在臨洪西北張村四寨附近，被日軍截擊，其殲減已迫眉睫。</p>
<p>濟南廿六日中央社電　渝魯蘇戰區海軍陸戰隊司令朱子銘將軍，近因覺悟抗戰之非，已決定率領所部千二百名，並參加吳化文將軍之山東方面軍，猛擊渝第五十一軍，刻山東中部渝共兩軍，因朱子銘將軍之參加和平陣營，無不大爲衝動。</p>
<p>南京廿六日中央社電　國府山東方面軍總司令吳化文上將所部，前曾於本月十二日拂曉，在魯省境內與渝軍第五十一軍軍長周光烈，及新編第卅六師師長劉桂堂等展開激戰，始終採取勇猛攻勢，重創渝軍，截至十九日止，查明渝軍遺屍一九〇〇具，被俘二百人，並被截獲輕機槍十一挺，步槍二〇七枝等。</p>
<p>東京廿六日中央社電　據晋南前綫廿六日來電，渝軍朱耀光所部約四白人，曾於卅一日夜渡過黃河，侵入晋省南端夢縣東方八公里之康家坪附近，然日軍已預知其企圖，當卽對之加以猛擊，已予以潰滅打擊。茲誌此役日軍戰果如次：渝軍棄屍二三五具，被俘八五人，日軍截獲品計輕機槍三，步槍五〇，手槍四，擲彈筒一。</p>
<p>東京廿六日中央社電　據晋冀豫省境前綫廿六日來電，由中國戰士一隊組成之某部隊特別工作隊，亦參加此次作戰，與日軍協力，對於日軍引導道路，輸送食糧，或日軍通過一村落時，先行進入該村散放傳單，宜撫民衆，頗爲活躍。且於水冶鎭以西戰綫，救護日軍負傷勇士，有時與渝軍遭遇則利用熟習之地形，以步槍射擊。日軍對彼等之出力，極表感謝，日軍勇士每將不易得到之烟草，分與中國勇士，彼等則爲日軍尋覓水井以解決日軍勇十炎熱乾渴問題，此種中日一體之親善情况，到處可見日軍某某部隊長曾詢及彼等中國參戰之意義，彼等則答以能協力日軍作戰，最爲欣快，現仍繼續同生共死之作戰。</p>
<p>東京廿六日中央社電　據晋冀豫省境日軍前綫電，日軍前於廿日在京漢路某方面開始前進後，已將渝第四十軍三萬人包圍於西南一隅，自廿四日以來即連日圍攻，結果該處渝軍已潰不成軍，四處亂竄，蟄伏山中及附近村落，惟經日軍嚴密搜案，業已大部被俘，迄廿五日止，已查明渝軍遺屍一千具，（內有團長五人）被俘九百人，（內遊擊區隊長等將官五人團長二人校官五十人）又日軍並截獲迫擊砲一門，重機槍三挺，輕機槍廿挺，步槍六百枝，無綫電機六座，及其他軍需品甚夥。</p>
<p>東京廿六日中央社電　據晋南太行山南部前綫廿六日來電，日軍精銳部隊於粉碎林縣臨淇陵川等地渝軍據點後，自廿五日起，一齊展開掃蕩戰，渝軍主力因日南進部隊之急追，乃向陵川南方四散逃竄。又林縣附近之殘敗渝軍，於日軍突入臨淇後，已陷於潰滅狀態。又日軍北進部隊克服困難之地形，猛追殘敗渝軍，廿六日晨巳進至某地，與日軍南下某部隊相呼應，展開一大殲滅戰。至廿六日止，所判明北上部隊之綜合戰果如次，渝軍被俘三千二百人，棄屍一千人，日軍截獲品計步槍一千枝，子彈九萬三千，手槍一千七百支，輕機槍三百五十挺，重機槍二，追擊砲三，手溜彈一千零十，無綫電機二，電話機三，軍服類三千一百件，軍馬一百二十匹。</p>
<h3>褚特使覲謁日皇　呈遞同光大勳章</h3>
<p>東京廿六日中央社電　國府外交部長褚民誼，此次以特派大使之資格，於本日上午十時二十分晋宮覲謁日天皇陛下，以在主席所贈與之同光大勳章呈遞日天皇陛下後，頃在此間帝國飯店發表談話，大意謂：本日余以國府特派大使之資格覲謁日天皇陛下，並以汪主席所贈與之同光大勳章，呈遞日天皇陛下，承日天皇陛下賜詞，誠不勝光榮之至。回憶余前任駐日大使，及以在主席隨員之資格，曾數次覲謁日天皇陛下，多承陛下優遇，得能完成所負之重任，實感無上光榮，並不勝感激。</p>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　國民政府汪主席前曾承日天皇陛下贈與大勳位菊花大綬章，此次特以我國最高勳位同光大勳章，贈與日天皇陛下，並派遣褚外交部部長爲特派大使。褚特使於二十六日偕隨員特命全權公使張超，外交部亞洲師長薛逢元，外交部秘書徐義宗等，晋謁日天皇陛下，呈遞同光大勳章。是日上午十時十五分，褚特派大使曁隨員等由坊城待部官引導，自帝國飯店乘皇宮特派之汽車，經正門二重橋晋宮。十時二十分抵宮內後，與我駐日特命全權大使徐良氏由待部官引導人鳳凰間，日天皇陛下於三十分階松平宮相百武侍從長及蓮沼侍從武官長等進鳳凰間，又重光外相亦侍立在旁，首由徐大使介紹褚特派大使，覲謁日天皇陛下，天皇陛下並賜以握手，繼由褚特派大使致訪日之詞，並呈遞在主席贈與盟邦最高勳章同光大勳章，及國民政府呈遞勳章之國書，日天皇陛下轉囑淸水通譯官贈以優渥之詞，繼由褚特派大使介紹隨員張超氏等相繼覲謁　天皇陛下後。特派大使等一行，遂於十一時　由宮中退出。</p>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　國民政府二十六日以同光大動章，奉贈日本天皇陛下，日本天皇特於同日致電國府汪主席表示謝意。</p>
<p>東京廿六日中央社電　國府外交部長褚民誼氏，于廿五日偕同張　命全權公使，參拜靖國神社，與一般參拜者，同在神前致敬，對靖國之英靈，表示衷心感謝。旋又往參觀遊就館，始驅車返旅邸，並發表談話如次：『余參拜靖國神社，此爲第五次，但逢大祭之日，尙係初次，　于接踵而來之參拜羣衆，對英靈之赤誠表現，不勝感佩』。</p>
<h3>切實厲行禁賭　汪委員長令首都警備司令部</h3>
<p>軍事委員會　汪委員長，以時値推進新國民運動，舉國總力參戰之際，爲養成國民自肅自戒的精神，以完成戰時節約勤奮之生活，特訓令首都警備司令部，對賭博事件，嚴加禁止。該部奉令後，即擬具詳細辦法，呈請軍委會核准，已於二十六日起實行，嚴厲禁賭，首都熾烈的賭風，將爲之一掃而空。</p>
<p>賭博之害，是人所盡知的，也許賭徒本身比一般人要知道的更淸楚，不過浸沉其中，日久而不能自拔，政府如不採取斷然處置，則賭風將日盛，而前途更不堪設想了。所以今次首都切實禁賭，是必要而且是有效的措置。</p>
<p>禁賭的辦法，已經公佈了，實行也開始了，但是成績的好壞，還是靠「人爲」來決定的，一件事情其所以不能收到預期的效果，決不是辦法方針的不對，十有九是要歸罪於「人爲」的不力，禁賭當然不能例外，如果賭風，未能根絕，則執行者，是應當負全部責任的。</p>
<p>雷厲風行的禁賭，不僅是在南京應該如此，全國各地也應如此，因爲幾年來各地的賭風，實在太盛了。每家有賭具，每戶有牌聲，尤其賭具商店林立市上，更使人感到賭風的可怕，我們希望軍委會再更進一步，訓令各省保安司令部，按照首都禁賭辦法，切實執行，這樣才可以納全國人民生活於正軌，以適應戰時的需要。　（中央社）</p>
<h3>浙贛路恢復通車　舉行盛大通車典禮　上海金華車亦定年內完成</h3>
<p>金華廿六日中央社電　去年五月日軍在浙東浙贛發動二大作戰，該地一帶爲日軍確保後，即由日軍當局與華中鐵道公司共同着手恢復浙贛綫工程，進展極爲迅速。目前除修築錢塘江大鐵橋外，杭州金華間一百八十七公里之全部工程，均經吿竣，自二十五日起，由華中鐵道公司在錢塘江杭州對岸靜江江岸金華間，開始行駛直達通車。華中鐵道公司，於二十五日上午六時，由杭州金華兩地同時駛出首次列車。十一時並在金華舉行盛况熱烈之浙贛綫通車典禮，參加者除華中振興公司高島，植塲副總裁，並其他華中公司代表，以及華中鐵道公司田副總裁外，並到有中日軍政長官等一百五十餘人。行禮如儀，首由佐藤華中鐵道公司浙贛綫整備局長致開會辭，繼由田副總裁讀祭詞，來賓發表祝辭，當事人報吿工程經過，有功者　與表彰狀，旋即散會。該日沿綫一帶以及金華鄰近地區，如蘭谿武義等地居民，均聞風前來參加，致金華一地，終日充滿慶祝景象，盛况空前，得未曾有。</p>
<p>金華二十六日中央社電　浙贛路通車後，杭州金華玉山等地，巳吿銜接，而東起上海，西至南昌，九江，株州等，浙，贛，湘三省之要　亦得以貫通，故其地位，極爲重要。此路前曾遭渝軍破壞，日軍進駐後，即與華中鐵道公司，決定修復，於去年十月一日，開始第一期湄池金華間之修復工事。第二期亦於去年十二月一日開始，至本年四月二十日即吿完竣，故可由杭州經湄池，直到金華。現當局復又定於八月起，進行第三期工事，修理錢塘江大鐵橋，預定於本年內完成。又增築金華武義問之支錢，最近即將開工，並預定與上海杭州金華間之直接通車，均於本年內完成。今後隨大東亞戰爭之進展，而建設連結東京昭南之大東亞鐵道，或亞歐連絡鐵道時，該綫即爲世界鐵道之一環，其地位必將愈形重要。又浙贛路通車後，該地區經濟之開發，今後必有急劇之進展。該地區原爲華中最大穀倉，米·麥·粟·茶·烟葉·亞麻·絲·棉花·桐油等，農產物產量極豐，此外礦產·林產·畜產等，亦極豐富，其中金華附近之螢石礦開發，尤爲重要，蓋因此爲大東亞戰爭中，不可或缺之重要資源。且其蘊藏量佔世界第一位，品質亦極佳，故自去年十月起，即由華中礦業公司，着手局部開採，武義附近亦發見螢石礦脈聞開蘊藏量達世界總額百分之六十以上。此外爲戰時重要物資之桐油，亦以金華爲中心，輸出甚多，觀此可知浙東面各種豐富物資，對於大東亞戰爭貢獻至鉅，故浙贛路之開通，在經濟意義上，亦極重大。</p>
<p>金華二十六日中央社電　浙贛綫啣結杭州，金華，玉山等地，地位極居重要，民國二十六年渝軍於炸毀方吿竣工之錢塘江大鐵橋後，即將路綫完全破壞。迨三十一年五月日軍發動浙贛作戰，肅淸渝軍後，於十月一日由日軍工程隊與華中鐵道公司共同着手恢復湄池金華間長達一百三十五公里之第一期工程，至十二月八日已可行駛輕軌列車，本年四月一日，復開始行駛　軌列車。第二期工程（由杭州對岸之靜江江岸至湄池間長四十公里）係於去年十二月一日開始動工，至本年四月二十日吿竣，由靜江江岸經湄池至金華之一百七十六公里，遂吿全綫通車。又錢塘江大鐵橋之修復作業，列作第三期工程，將繼續於本年八月着手動工，預定年內即可完工。又金華武義間之新路綫，亦定於最近開工建築，上海，杭州，金華間之幹綫，以及金華武義間之支綫，大體均可於本年年內完成。此次全綫通車之由靜江江岸至金華間全長一百七十六公里之修復作業，其困難幾與建築新綫全然相同，然結果費時僅六個餘月，即吿全部完成，實創世界鐵道建設史上新記錄。此次工程開始後，華人職員以及沿綫住民，均予絕大協力，在當地採用之勞工，最高亦達一萬五千人，全部工程之總工人員達一百萬人。目因各地居民之協力，匪賊毫無蠢動餘地。又該地區爲木材之產地，故枕木等建設用材均得自給，對於工程之進展，予以絕大助力。又金華週邊鄰接渝万統治地區，故此次之全綫通車，對於渝方地區之居民，亦有極大影響，而在軍事政治經濟方面其意義均極重大。</p>

<h3>美航空母艦蘭格爾號　在大西洋被擊沉　美開戰以來此爲第七艘</h3>
<p>柏林二十五日中央社電　官方今晚宣吿：美國一萬四千五百噸之航空母艦「蘭格爾」號，已在北大西洋被德國蒲洛艇長指揮之潛艇所擊沉，希特勒頃已以鐵十字橡樹葉武士獎章授矛蒲洛以酬其功。該美國航空母艦「蘭格爾」號乃在大西洋負保衛航運之責，係於一九三一年九月二十六日安放龍骨，一九三三年二月二十五日下水，可載飛機七十二架，全體官兵共一千七百八十八名。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十六日中央社電　據斯蒂芬尼社倫敦消息：反軸心護航隊一隊，在北大西洋與德潛艇交戰，業已三日。星期六德潛艇曾作十三次襲擊。</p>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　元首行營二十六日發表美航空母艦「蘭格爾」號在大西洋水域遭德潛艇猛攻後，已被擊沉云。按德潛艇之擊沉美航空母艦，此次尙屬初次，至德義海軍之擊沉英航空母艦，前已有「躭勒賈斯」號二二五〇〇噸，「約克皇家」號二二五〇〇噸，「神鷹」號二六〇〇〇噸，「光榮」號二五〇〇〇噸等四艘，此次已爲第五艘。蘭格爾號雖係載重一四五〇〇噸之小型航空母艦，但其搭載飛機數量及其他裝備，則可匹敵改裝之大型航空母艦。此次係在護衛運輸船團遭德潛艇所擊沉。當大東亞戰爭開始前後，配備於太平洋方面之美航空母艦，其遭日海軍攻擊而相繼沉沒者，計有「勒克辛頓」號，「薩拉特加」號，「約克城」號，「黃蜂」號，「恩特普萊斯」號，「霍納特」號等六艘，現又在大西洋上喪失「蘭格爾」號一艘，前美國在大東亞戰事開始前所有之航空母艦七艘，業已悉被擊沉。惟美海軍鑒於航空母艦在近代海戰中之重要，現似正積極添建中，如變更早艦設計，或將商船改裝爲航空母艦及特設航空母艦等。</p>
<p>協約船舶損失重大</p>
<p>阿根廷京城二十六日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：特魯曼委員會對於一九四二年反軸心各國船舶在大西洋損失數額公開宣布後，南美方面亦不免發生某種影響。英美海軍當局之保守緘默，致使一般人認爲此項損失，對於戰事進行並不重要。英美政治家時常發表之樂觀論調，謂建成之新艦數額，超過沉失之船隻云云，亦無人懷疑及之。惟最近數迎中，注意時局者已覺察有若干事，令人難以滿意，尤以美國境內此種情緒更爲明顯。紐約某著名大報曾稱當局方面之隱瞞眞相，實爲一種愚蠢之手段云。據此間普令沙報載稱，隨船同沉海底之貨物，足敷供應五十個師團或一百萬兵士之用。至於官方所稱造成船隻多於沉失船隻一節，實則僅有九月份爲然。</p>
<h3>冰島制定憲法　明夏宣吿獨立</h3>

<h3>美芬關係　並無變化</h3>
<p>芬蘭京城廿六日中央社電　芬蘭京城無綫電新聞評述員，昨晚否認謠言所傳此間美使館職員之於星期五離此赴瑞典京城，係由於美芬關係之惡化。評論員稱，據此間所知，兩國國交絕無變化，謠言所傳謂美國此舉之前，蘇聯曾向芬提出締結和平之說，亦無根據云。同時此間對於美國撤回使館人員之舉，解釋粉紜。有某權威方面以爲此舉並無害處，並全無政治上之重要性，其他則以爲此乃外交關係斷絕之先兆。此間所發芬蘭官方公報曾宣布撤退之事實，但未說明其理由。</p>
<h3>叙利亞　政局緊張</h3>
<p>安加拉廿六日中央社電　據海通社記者斯密斯轉據大馬色消息：自叙利亞全國宣布包圍狀態後，各黨派之選舉遽遭阻碍，因集會及言論自由已大受限制，且晚上八時須戒嚴，使晚間選舉大會不克舉行，蓋最高委員長特戈爾與暗中主宰之英人，以及叙國臨時首相，似一致祗准愜意之叙人爲候補者，藉以建設一適宜之國會。特戈爾則不欲叙國擁有最大勢力之黨徒，卽國民黨操縱一切，故在選舉未開始前，已將該黨領袖拘捕，且以實行包圍狀態爲藉口，將其他黨員交警察扣留，使彼等不能加入選舉。但國民黨之躱藏於各敎堂，開始普遍反對特戈爾與叙首相爲數亦多。總之叙利亞之政治空氣已達緊張階段，當局對於報紙雖不准刊布任何消息，政治觀察家咸認政治總罷工必爲此項國內緊張狀態之結果。</p>

<h3>軸心軍作有力反攻　突境西部大戰方酣　突港防務堅强敵攻勢遇阻　美陸軍司令麥克納亞受傷</h3>
<p>里斯本二十六日中央社電　綜合突尼西亞前綫消息，英第八軍在美軍及法軍協力下，曾於突尼西亞西部戰綫開始總攻，然並未獲有任何效果，現激戰之中心，爲梅傑茲埃爾巴勃與布阿拉達間之地區。反軸心軍於該地區因受德軍虎型戰車及對戰車砲之攻擊巳喪失戰車八十七輛。於塞捷納媽地區，英突擊隊曾企圖前進，然遭軸心軍彈力性之防禦戰阻止，其攻擊企圖巳完全失敗，同時於南部地區，蒙高茂萊所部之英軍及紐西蘭軍曾於數地點展開局部攻擊，但巳被擊退。</p>
<p>柏林二十五日中央社電　德義防綫西部戰綫之猛烈大戰，現仍繼續進行，其激烈程度仍未稍减。依據此間本日可接獲之消息，尙未能斷定戰事，已否達到最高峯。但此項消息，皆謂英美軍之增援源源不絕，反軸心軍不斷以新補充部隊加人作戰，以彌補其因向强固之軸心陣綫攻擊而蒙受之嚴重損失。德國官方消息謂，此處地區戰鬥之性質，業已改變。據海通社稱，英美軍在數處地方有局部勝利，軸心軍正勞力作有力之反攻。反軸心軍攻擊之第一日，德義軍幾完全皆能保守其陣地，英軍雖在少數地點獲得局部勝利，但因德軍之反攻，而被迫退却。英軍攻擊之中心，係在西面側認之中段，其巡攻之目的，顯係欲沿公路向東北推進，公路之大部份係在良好之狀况。反軸心軍於突破軸心陣地後，希圖前進至軸心軍所守地區中心之突尼斯。突尼西亞地區，雖於星期六及昨日仍有劇戰，但柏林軍事方面本日宣稱，反軸心軍仍未能獲得任何有決定性之成功。當反軸心攻擊之衝之德軍坦克車隊及步兵隊，有德國轟炸機及近搏戰鬥機爲之協助。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城二十六日中央社電　據華盛頓電，美陸軍部二十五日宣稱：北非美陸軍司令麥克納亞中將，曾於本月二十三日在突尼西亞戰綫負傷。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城二十六日中央社電　美陸軍司令麥克納亞中將，於突尼西亞戰綫負傷後，據華盛頓來電稱，美陸軍部已於二十五日任命美第一軍司令利亞中將代理陸軍司令之職。</p>
<h3>戰事蔓延至西西里　地中海義空軍活躍</h3>
<p>羅馬廿五日中央社電　斯蒂芬尼社訊，義航空部喉舌空綫報載稱：突尼西亞之軸心空軍，雖祗有少數機塲，且均集中於沿海岸毫無掩護之狹小地帶，但仍能以寡敵衆，竭力協助陸軍作戰。義機隊現正從事於襲擊敵方摩托與鐵甲部隊及砲位，頗能收效，義方戰鬥機在突尼西亞東南部上空尤爲活躍。目前突尼西亞戰事，已蔓延至西西里海峽及西西里之本身，義機對於保護該地及護航隊極爲得力。</p>
<p>羅馬二十六日中央社電　義最高指揮今日宣稱：義機在地中海擊沉敵貨船二艘，一載重八千噸，一爲五千噸。敵機在西西里投彈，損失房屋數處，炸斃平民一人，加格列里今晨亦遭襲，犧牲人數尙未查悉，前數日義機四架未返根據地。</p>
<h3>德戰時實行　以物易物制度</h3>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　據海通訊：因戰爭關係，多數日用品均停止製造，爲滿足德國個人之需要起見，乃產生以物易物之新制度。是以每日報上廣吿欄內，常見以物易物之廣吿。市政當局爲杜絕奸人從中牟利計，乃聘請專家管理是項事件，成績極佳。即以皮鞋而論，過去三年中所交換者共篷四萬變之多。</p>
<h3>蒙杜維上空　發現彩虹三道</h3>
<p>羅馬二十五日中央社電　據此間海通社消息：蒙杜維上空，於今晨七時至九時半發現彩虹三道，其地位各不相同，襯托於蔚藍色之空中，蔚爲奇觀，雖天文學專家亦難解釋其原因。</p>
<h3>諾伏洛西斯克區　蘇軍攻勢被擊退</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十五日中央社電　東綫之大規模戰鬥，巳於十日前在主要戰細上停頓，現時在庫彭區亦已停止，該處僅有局部之戰事，但此項情况，似不能歷時甚久，今晚德方消息謂，蘇軍數次冀圖奪回其在過去數日間在諾伏洛西斯克地區所失去之陣地，以免其側冀遭受威脅，但此舉未能成功。庫彭區之陸上戰鬥，現仍受泥濘所阻，蘇軍在過去數日間曾屢次向沼澤地區之德軍陣地攻擊，但被砲火擊回，喪失滿綫之船艇四十艘，陣亡數百人。同時强有力之德空軍隊亦協助陸上部隊，向蘇軍之油站及軍火庫襲擊。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十六日中央社電　據海通訊，路透社莫斯科報吿稱，雙方日夜忙於佈置，預料將來必有大戰發生，空軍活動在東餞各段尤爲激化。</p>
<h3>雅片戰爭的新意義</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>本月十五日，我們發表過一篇吉田先生的關於物價問題的文章，我們曾經介紹過吉田先生是友邦日本人士中鼓熟悉中國，也是最同情中國的一位。今天又蒙吉田先生寫這篇「鴉片戰爭的新意義」的文章。鴉片戰爭的結果，是英帝國主義毒害得中國民族百餘年陷於貧弱的絕境，我們想每一個有國家觀念的同胞，決不會忘掉這一個毒辣的枷鎖。可是，到今天我們國土之內，誠如吉田先生所指出的許多地方，還是存在着半公開的吞雲吐霧的塲所，這種恬不知恥的『癮君子』，雖涕泗交流的癮得死去，也不値我們同情的。吉田先生特別提出國民政府應做到和平區內無一『癮君子』的事實，爲促使重慶治下的智識分子歸趨的向心力，這深長的意思，我們深表同情的。——編者附言</p>
<p>以鴉片爲題材的中聯傑作「萬世流芳」影片，聽說日來在大光明大戲院開映着。由着這個機會，中國知識階級間，對於鴉片戰爭的新意義，一定發生着新的關心吧。說到鴉片戰爭，其爲一個不道德的戰爭，甚至連英國首相格蘭斯頓，也說着：「像這個戰爭那樣，其原因的不正當，是沒有的；又像這個戰爭那樣，使英國蒙受永久的恥辱的，也是沒有的」的話。彼時英帝國主義使用一部分無知無識的印度人，使把那徐徐破壞中華民族的健康之毒物，强制中國人購買，鴉片雖然不是由英國人開頭輸入中國的，可是藉着戰爭以强制輸入中國，自始至終，却只有英國。「鴉片」這個名詞，原來不是中國所本有的，而是由阿拉伯語「Afyun」轉化而成的外來語；舊時還用着和原音相近的「阿芙蓉」一語，鴉片的服用，是由古代希臘人首先發明的，由希波克拉底斯傳給阿拉伯人，更由阿拉伯人傳給印度，據說在第八世紀時，已經傳到中國來了。鴉片起初傳來的時候，原來只作藥用的，然而在十一世紀時，罌粟的栽培，已經在中國各地相當普遍了。不過鴉片問題的成爲重大的社會問題，却實在是英國東印度公司的獎勵鴉片對華輸出以後。當時中國的白銀爲了鴉片的輸入，漏往英國去的，達莫大的數額。在鴉片戰爭的前夜（一八三六——三七年間），巳達一千四百五十萬元之鉅。因爲這個緣故，使國內的銀價暴騰；原來銀圓一元，只可兌換銅錢七八百文，到一八三八年時，已漲至銀圓一元，可兌換銅錢一千六百文了。因之，一般民衆的生活很是困難；商業資本和高利貸資本便利用了它，越發使民衆生活加增困苦。</p>
<p>這樣的社會情勢，終於使國民意識覺醒起來，刺戟着中國的知識階級。那時代裏，代表學者官僚的，如許乃濟，朱嶟，黃爵滋，袁玉麟，許球，朱成烈，林則徐等那許多人，各各把關於禁止鴉片的建白書和意見書等，呈奏朝廷。其中尤其是湖廣總督林則徐的奏章，爲道光皇帝所嘉獎。這也並非沒有理由，因爲許乃濟，黃爵滋等，專重視銀兩的流出，本着財政的見地立論；對之，林則徐却本着保存國力的遠大見地，而主張禁烟。在他的奏章上，曾這樣說：「鴉片不速禁絕，則國日貧，民日弱，數十年後，豈惟無可籌之餉，抑且無可用之兵」。他的道種站在國家主義的觀點的立論，大爲道光皇帝所感動。即他的意思，以爲要保存國家實力，鴉片無論如何，是必須加以禁絕的。在他看來，以財政上的顧慮作爲鴉片間題的基礎，實是極爲薄弱的論據。嗣後論到中國的鴉片問題，往往不能超越這財政的立塲和保存國力的立塲之對立。進步的知識階級，以爲財政上縱有任何困難，爲了中華民族的存續，鴉片是絕對要加以禁止的。林則徐實是揭藥這個要求，對於英帝國主義，實行孤高的挑戰的第一個人。</p>
<p>在當時英國的對華貿易上，鴉片是佔着百分之五十四的。英帝國主義肯把這樣的利益，爲了亞細亞民族的幸福而加以放棄，那樣的博愛心是沒有的。爲了這個緣故，英國竟然對於中華民族的生存攸關的正當要求，不恤以武力爲對付；同時由着南京條約，開闢租界於中國的五大要港，作爲其鴉片的恒久輸入路綫。南京條約如果把鴉片忽略掉，就把握不着這個條約的本質。鴉片戰爭以後，英國政府喪盡了廉恥，屢次促使中國政府正式承認鴉片的輸入。例如巴麥斯頓（HZ　T　Polmsrston）子爵，於一八四三年，對於英國駐華代表，曾頒着「務須努力促使中國政府承認鴉片作爲合法的商品而輸入的約定」的指令。由着那樣的行徑，故自南京條約以來，英國租界便成爲鴉片的公開走私地帶；這種情况，直到最近，依然存續着，這是我們所不能看過的事實。中國的進步的知識階殺，無不熟知外國租界是鴉片的治外法權地域，他們和林則徐同樣，對於無智的中國民衆，由着英國所奉敬的禮品而成爲「活屍」的現象，無不以難於按耐的憤懣之情，眼睜睜地目睹着。於是在他們的能力範圍之內，對於鴉片，進而對於擁護鴉片的外國帝國主義，繼續地奮鬥着，在這個意味上，廣義的鴉片戰爭，現在尙還賡續地戰着。</p>
<p>上述中國知識階級的戰鬥，實爲對於外國帝國主義的戰鬥，同時又爲對於那班與之結納使吸食鴉片的惡習在國內永久化的反動分子的戰鬥。在中國鴉片的販賣，已成爲軍閥的重要財源之一，所以一說到禁止鴉片，他們那班反動份子，必以財政的見地加以反對；對之，知識階級則必以保存國力的立塲，而爲主張。在立論上，那反逆民族獨立的澎湃潮流的前者之主張，到底不是後者的對手；可是在取締鴉片的實行方面，他們的財政主義，其勢力却遠比保存民族實力主義爲强大。反動份子們常由怠工以打破進步的知識階級的禁烟決定。因着道個緣故，不管國民政府於一九三四年宣言到一九四〇年完全禁絕鴉片的製造和吸食，直到一九四三年，今日，鴉片的禁絕，在中國的任何地方，都完全沒有實現。那不消說，當然不能不考慮到有所謂中日事變的大理由的。然而雖在中日事變中，中國知識階級對於禁烟的關心，還是絕不淡薄。重慶方面很知道這點，所以利用着知識階級的對於鴉片的關心，以作其對於日本的反宣傳。即他們宣傳着說，日本用着鴉片，正在有計劃地破壞中國人的健康。而且重慶方面的道種宣傳，常受英美援助，這個事實，又是値得注意的。民國二十九年十月出版的英文雜誌「亞細亞，」對於華北的吸食鴉片的情况，曾爲誇大的報吿說：「在北京，有三百零五家的燕子窠，六十一家的烟店；在天津，有一百九十五家的燕子窠，三十九家的烟店；在濟南，有一百四十家的燕子窠，廿八家的烟店；在唐山，有一百五十家的燕子窠，廿三家的烟店。」於是下着這樣惡意的結論說：「把中國有爲的靑年，用着鴉片來毒化，這就是東亞新秩序的眞相。」</p>
<p>於此我們所要注意之點，乃是成爲他們這種煽動的材料之事實，在我們方面，不能說都是沒有的。華北不去說它，上海的南市不待言，就是成爲國民政府之首都的南京，我們還是見到那所謂「戒烟所」，「談話室」的設施，至於其內容怎樣，恐怕沒有贅述的必要。不消說，急激地禁止吸食鴉片，往往有速使吸食者癮死，所以與其限以一定期間的嚴格的「禁烟」，不如以「戒烟」爲當。我以前曾直接聽到台灣總督後藤新平伯，有在台灣不採「禁烟」主義而採取戒烟主義，巳獲成功的話。南京政府若是本着這個見地採用戒烟主義，施行鴉片癮者的登記制，以此爲限，得出入於戒烟所，着　　　俾實現於一定期間之嚴格「禁烟」的計畫，那是沒有話說；可是實際的情形到底是甚麽樣呢？如果所謂「戒烟所」和「談話室」，是無論何人都得自由出入，而且用着女招待以誘引未成烟癮之靑年入殼的，那末由着保存國力的見地，是在所不許的。這種情形的持續，縱非林則徐，也不得不憂「國日貧，民日弱，數十年後……無可用之兵。」如果是這樣，那不單是中國的問題，而在日華兩民族共同對於英美爲空前未有的大戰爭的今日，國「無可用之兵，」就是日本也不能不同其戚憂的。</p>
<p>汪主席曾在那題爲「中國的諸問題和其解決策」的英文本中，有着下述的一段話：「我雖然並不過於重視過去的事實，但却要舉出一個例子來。承德的陷落，是湯玉麟的部隊無抵抗的直接結果。不管這軍隊是有着很好的配備，他們還是沒有抵抗，只是因爲他們犯着吸食鴉片的習慣，這其結果原是不足爲怪的，因爲無論甚麽人，不會期待鴉片鬼的軍隊，能够有抵抗力的。人民被强制栽種罌果，被强制的吸食鴉片，他們縱然是要抵抗，無奈是沒有必需的意志和體力。」（China＇s　Problems　and　Thir　Solution　by　Wang　Ching-Wei　1934Page　155）看了這一段話，可知汪主席早就知道鴉片的及於國力，有着很可怕的影響。因此，在和平區吸食鴉片的現狀，如果上述之爲事實，那末汪主席在最近將來，必定會得徹查實狀，實行其基於保存國力第一主義的措置的。</p>
<p>南京政府即應實現重慶所要做而不能做的禁烟政策，這於中日事變的解決上，是具有很重大之意義的。今日强化南京政府的唯一捷徑，是在首先獲得强大的中國民衆對於政府的擁護。而獲得中國民衆擁護的唯一捷徑，在使中國知識階級心服南京政府的政策。不管英美怎樣宣傳，重慶怎樣煽動，南京政府如能實现絕滅最後一人的吸食鴉片，安定和平區域的人民生活，躋於「路不拾遺」的境地，那末縱令怎樣爲頑强的抗日意識所陶養的中國知識階級，在這樣的事實之前，也不得不幡然變計，以擁護南京政府。即使不能驟躋於那樣理想的境地，如果着着地顯示確是誠意實行可以到達那樣境地的政策，那末便是在重慶治下的中國知識階級，也會得次第參加和平運動吧。現在擁護重慶的知識階級若是不擁護重慶，則蔣介石政權的基礎，便要根本動搖，自行分裂，而終致崩壞。這是現在蔣介石所最爲害怕的一點。反之，中國知識階級，若是始終擁護蔣介石，那末便是蔣介石被趕出重慶，逃到西藏去，他還是要繼續抗戰吧。現在對於重慶的戰爭，爲武力的戰爭，同時也爲道德的戰爭。因爲長期戰的士氣，結局是要爲道德所左右的。在現狀之下，南京政府與其是藉着武力和重慶作戰，還不如以道德征服重慶方面知識階級的良心，爲更好的戰術。在這樣的道德戰爭裏面，唯有鴉片問題是個絕好的戰塲。在重慶治下的四川，貴州，廣西，廣東等，自昔爲著名的鴉片產地，尤其是在四川，其吸食鴉片的習慣，最爲牢不可拔，蔣介石當然是採取禁烟主義的，然而人民吸食鴉片的習慣，到底還沒有根絕。對之，和平地區，因着遠離鴉片的生產地，烟價很是昂貴，所以如果南京政府能本着熱誠至意，從事對於鴉片的鬥爭，則其絕滅，是決非困難的。對於鴉片的戰爭，南京政府比諸重慶，是佔着遠多之「地利」的。</p>
<p>日本劉於這完成大東亞戰爭所絕對必要之人的要素，因着鴉片而破壞的現狀，也決不能不加以深切的關心的。因之，現在中國的鴉片問題，是要把財政主義的立塲、永久破棄，而必須從保存中華民族國力的立塲加以論斷的。在戰時下的東京，大阪，如果也有着像現在南京，上海所見的「戒烟所」和「談話室」等等怪現狀的存在，那末日本國民對之，將作如何感想呢？此時如果還是作着：「中國人是中國人，日本人是日本人，」那樣的想法，則和把中國人作爲大東亞戰爭的眞正戰友之思想，未免大相逕庭了吧。</p>
<p>我是主張要制勝對英美戰爭，日本非先挽起中國人的良心，尤其是中國智識階級的良心不可。因此以爲援助南京政府，使能急速獲得中國智識階級，以解決鴉片問題，實爲第一要務。如果實現抗戰地區燕子窠林立，和平地區一家的燕子窠也沒有的事實，則中國智識階級，就會沒有話說，而相信日本的誠心誠意了吧！</p>
<p>不過對於鴉片的鬥爭，自不像說說那樣容易的，封建的反動份子，常固守着財政主義的立塲，而燕子窠的流氓等，將藉金錢的力，以圖維持其榨取中華民族之鮮血的販毒機關吧。然而不欲中華民族滅亡，不，不欲亞細亞民族滅亡之中日知識階級，對於他們的反對，必將展開共同的道德鬥爭的。筆者確信唯由這樣的共同鬥爭，方能產生眞正的日華的總親善。（丁立才譯）</p>

<p>一·實際與理論的矛盾　一提到消費合作社，便要想起他的基本理論，——就是消費者互相結合起來，向生產者直接購貨，避免中間商的剝削，藉以减低消費者的負担。不過在這個動盪的市塲中，普徧鬧著物資不足。廠家有時有價無貨，有時廠盤高於市價，有時甚至不開廠盤，使你無可奈何，只得暫時擱起這個可貴的理論。例如本社初成立時，就想批進一二種普通牙膏，筆者曾親往一家老牌牙膏製造廠去接洽，那時他們的批價是每羅五百五十元，每枝差不多合到四元。承他們坦白地指示。還是向批發商那裏去批購，比較便宜得多，並且介紹了幾家批發商號。最後還誠懇地說：「在這個市面混亂的當兒，辦消費合作社未免要碰壁」。後來筆者去一打聽，此種牙膏的批價，每羅只二百六七十元，每枝合到一元八九角。可是你如果翻開當時的報紙來，便可以看到有許多百貨商店，以每枝一元甚至每枝五角的賤價，在招攬著生意。在這樣情形之下，筆者惟有暫時放棄批進牙膏的企圖了。到了最近，此種牙膏批價漲到每羅六百八十元左右，合每枝五元六七角，當筆者看到該廠刋登廣吿，每枝限價三元八角半時，自然喜出望外，連忙派人去接洽。豈知所得到的答覆，却是「沒有貨色」。不特牙膏如此，其他日用品市况，也往往相同。一個月前，爲了批購襪子，筆者曾一連接洽過好幾家廠家，不是「沒有貨色」，就是「廠盤還沒有開出」。這一切，不禁使筆者時常想起牙膏廠裏那位先生的忠吿，因爲之喟然嘆息。</p>
<p>二·批發價零售價的倒置　向廠家直接批貨，旣然碰了壁，自然只得暫時放棄理論，遷就事實，向黑市躉批買進了。蹙批買進，總比零售便宜，這是一般的經騐，消費合作社無妨退一步，從這裏找一條出路。豈知在物價上漲的時候，因有囤戶大批拖進貨物，批發價特別高昂。而商店零售價，以限制稍嚴，未便隨時增加，因此反較低廉。在二月中，本社想批進毛巾，當時市上批價，二十三兩漂自毛巾每打八十五元左右，可是三友實業社門售每打只七十二元。三十二支狗頭牌襪子，市上批價每打漲到二百元的時候，零售價還只十六七元。上面所說的牙膏，也是一個例子，零售價與批發價的倒置，非身歷其境者，決不會置信的。如此市塲，消費合作社更從何處去我尋出路？</p>
<p>三·派貨多數輪不到合作社　消費合作社旣然到處碰壁，何不向配給機關請求派貨，這豈不是一條康莊大道嗎？是的，有幾種日用品，是可以取得派貨的，本社曾先後取得火柴肥皂食糖食油等派貨；火柴食糖，足敷分配，食油是配給本社經濟食堂的，勉强够用，這是應該感謝的。至於肥皂一項，六個月來只派到一箱固本肥皂，誠所謂杯水車薪，無濟於事。此外多數配給機關，對於消費合作社這種組織，大概還覺得生疏，不肯承認他也是一種商業機構，可以與普通商店等量齊觀，因而加以漠視，對於他的請求不予理睬。例如本社與新聞報同人消費合作社，共同請求捲烟派貨，按照手續，塡寫了申請書，大概認爲我們並非烟兌業的一員，不够資格，所以申請書送去後，彷如石沉大海，渺無消息。實則假手消費合作社，實行分配，倒可以使商品直接達到消費者的手裏，决不會像一般商店那樣偷機取巧，使消費者感到有價無貨之苦。</p>
<p>四·適應環境的改變　每一種制度的產生，自有他當時的環境，環境變遷，那末適應環境的制度，自然會隨之修正，在目前道種特殊環境中，消費合作社爲了要達到减輕消費者的負担，何妨轉一個小小的灣，免得到處碰壁。在物價上漲的當兒，今日批進的貨物，在當時比較零售價，果然並不便宜。可是過了一月兩月，零售價上漲，那末早已批進的東西，豈不又成爲便宜貨了嗎？於是爲了要避免物價上漲的壓迫，消費合作社本身不得不多存儲些貨物，爲消費而存儲貨物，當然不能視爲囤貨。在無可奈何中，本社便採取了這種轉灣的辦法，不過採取這種辦法，自然需要相當的資本，本社有本館爲後盾，尙且有時感到周轉不靈，如果是普通消費者的結合，沒有相當資力的後盾，這就恐怕難以辦到了。而且採取這種辦法，在物價暴落的時候，更須冒虧本的危險。</p>
<p>五·外行生意經　撫養一個初生的孩子，確乎不是一件容易的事情，起初捉摸不住他的性情，難以確切斷定他的需要，及至他逐漸長大，他的需要範圍日益擴大，做保姆的爲了要適應他的需要，今天要打聽這項行情，明天又要比較那種貨色。因此一個外行保姆，也學會了許多生意門檻，譬如毛巾襪子這類東西，成本是應該如何計算的，因而知道估計價格時，毛巾應該秤重量，辨花色，看毛頭。襪子應該秤重量，辦支數，看光澤。至於辨別肥皂的品質，甚至要用舌尖去舐，導在外行人看來，簡直是不能置信的辦法。不過外行生意，格外吃力，尤其是在物價漲落得厲害的今日，不免時常要提心弔胆，惟恐吃虧。至於對某種貨物究竟有多大胃口，這在沒有經騐者，更覺得難以捉摸。有時恐怕貨物進得太多，去路呆滯，有時又恐怕供應得太少。誠如一位先生提出的辦法，爲了採辦食油，本社也曾接洽，豈知接洽定當後，出售者因市面上漲，不肯脫手了。更有一次，取得了十擔食鹽的配給，深恐購買者不會踴躍，而時日躭擱梢久，又怕食鹽落露，急求脫售，不得不與食糖搭銷。豈知不多時，就銷售一空，後來者反抱向隅之憾。</p>
<p>嘮嘮叨叨說了一大堆話，在老前輩看來，也許要認爲都是幼稚的經騐，無足稱道，恰巧新聞報同人消費合作社舉行過座談會，還要互相團結起來，組織協會，那麼我道不孤，將來互相研究，互相商討，或可想出一個穩健的方針，使我們消費合作社根基鞏固，投資者覺得可靠，此則同人責任所在，常努力從事的也。</p>
<h3>經濟界　評言　可資借鏡的一件事</h3>
<p>「鏡子是少不來的。」自己沒有，不妨取借，所以叫着「借鏡」。我們認爲這次工部局物資統制處解除十調查員的職務，並且把被解職者的姓名與照處，在中外各報紙上，予以公開的披露，是足資一般經濟統制機關借鏡的。</p>
<p>工部局物資統制處十調查員解職的理由，雖無明文宣布，可是相信這樣一個披露的方式，至少是要促使公衆注意到被解職者的尊姓大名和本來面目，此中用意，當然是十分深刻而且耐人尋味的。</p>
<p>原來，人事問題爲經濟統制機構中最爲重要，亦最爲複雜，最爲困難的一個問題。所謂「人數衆多，賢不肖在所難免」。最有效的箝制辦法，自莫如「有事實可憑者，即逕行露佈，公諸社會，俾有所制裁。」祇怕儘管有事實可憑，但因格於情面，或懾於勢力，遂不惜「藏垢納汚」就此了事。這是一般經濟統制機構，尤其是自治經濟統制機構，所最須提防，最須切戒的。因爲統制制度中一個神聖無上的原則，是不可利用統制機會，更不可假藉統制權勢，換一句話說，就是不可把「統制」當作「生財之道」。人言可畏，所以，主持統制的當局，對於參加統制工作人員，必須寄以最嚴密的注意。</p>
<h3>各公會及聯合會　五月底一律組成</h3>
<p>國府當局爲實施戰時經濟政策綱領，强化商業團體自主統制起見，特經最高國防會議通過，設立全國商業統制總會及頒布戰時物資移動取締暫行條例，均已逐步進行統制工作，同時國府設置物資統制審議委員會以爲督促全國商業統制總會完善運用機能之督導機關，故爲適合戰時經濟體制計，由實業部頒布工商同業公會暫行條例，從事調整組織工商各業團體經濟機構，以在全國商業統制總會之下爲各業統制機構，統一收買及配給事宜。</p>

<h3>杭州新茶上市</h3>
<p>杭市夙稱產茶區域，本年雨水調勻，產量豐富，日來各茶行牧貨甚湧，熱閙異常。惟本年茶價較昔爲高，近日各貨市價，計獅峯正號每斤燥價二百五十元，副號二百元，本山龍井同三百六十元，梅塢正號同三百二十元，副號同二百二十元，四鄉正路龍井每斤潮價一百另八元，富陽正路同一百元，雜路市貨同八十元至九十元，潮步龍井旗紅同一百元，在前數日初報新時，各貨市價尙須各增數十元，且茶葉原屬鮮貨，嗣後出貨日多，其價照例或須逐日看低。</p>
<h3>讀者論壇　上海工商業的新階段與其當前急務</h3>
<p>— 弋人</p>
<p>過去，中國是個次殖民地的國家。英美帝國主義者加在中國身上無數的枷鎖，他們利用武力而造成了種種特權，一方面把中國當作資本輸出的市塲，一方面也當作商品輸出的市塲；同時在另一方面，則購買中國的極低廉的勞働力，攫取中國的物資原料，更利用他們在關稅方面的特權。試想以次殖民地的中國底幼稚的工商業怎能與英美帝國主義者利用種種特權的優勢的經濟勢力相抗衡呢？中國的民族工業被壓抑得透不過氣來，始終未能抬頭。因此而使中國的國民經濟日趨衰疲，農村破產，工商業不景氣，弄得中國的經濟一蹶不振！</p>
<p>回顧過去中國的工商業銀行業所處於英美帝國主義者的附庸或侍婢的地位，就可想見一斑了！即所謂堂堂的國家銀行，如中，中，交等三大銀行，亦不過爲英美帝國主義者辦理借款，匯兌，及購買中國原料等等的買辦與代理人而已！</p>
<p>然而自從大東亞戰爭爆發以至國府宣佈參戰以來，中國的經濟前途，亦隨之而顯現了一綫新曙光。</p>
<p>事實正展開在我們的眼前，比方說：過去英美帝國主義者飛揚跋扈的優勢經濟地位喪失殆盡，取而代之的便是新興的中國的民族工業。另一方面，日本政府一本其道義政策把敵方的工廠財產移交國府經營管理；此外，像緩和物資移動限制的新決定與實施，都成爲中國經濟因而獲得一個簇新的平等的活動條件，這不用說是具有莫大的意義，而且是中國經濟的發展史上一個劃時代的新階段。</p>
<p>因此，中國現巳獲得發展國民經濟的非常有利的優越條件與時機。汪主席曾在新國民運動綱領裏說：「我們爲什麽不能實行民生主義呢？因爲我們忽略了發達國家資本。我們如能着重此點，則國家資本發達，私人資本自然歸於節制。」可見要提高發展國民的經濟生活，必須首先發達國家資本，而並不絕對限止私人資本。這才是發展中國國民經濟的前提條件，這才是符合中國國情，符合民生主義的經濟政策。（未完）</p>
<h3>中國通貨問題（一）</h3>
<p>— 今村忠男著</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>我們常常聽得說：「通貨問題最難，尤其是中國的通貨問題不明瞭，我們所學的通貨理論，不易理解者極多。」或者說：「隨時代的轉變，舊通貨理論已不通用，需要新的通貨原理。尤其是在中國，需要中國的通貨理論。」不錯，中國的通貨問題，在不能充分理解中國社會政治，或是習慣心理的一部份日本人，常然要感覺困難。中國的貨幣現象：對於日本人從來所學的通貨理論，有所隔膜，因之常有種種錯誤的見解。我們須知貨幣原則，決不會因時因地而異的。</p>
<p>人類的社會生活，雖然會因時因地而有若干不同，可是相差距離決無海闊天空之遠，中國也是東亞經濟的一環，與日本處同樣的經濟社會生活，在同一的金融機構之下，其貨幣原則，根本上不會有多大差別，獨自變化的，人家所感覺差異或變化者，不過是原則適用的前提有變化或則不同而巳：原則始終還是原則，在同一前提條件之下，在中國也和日本同樣適應。但是，在中國其前提條件不同，所以在原則差別的前提條件之上來當它是合式的，當然不容易理解，於是認爲中國通貨問題就難在這裏，我們所學的是沒有原則的，或則認爲中國通貨問題有了變化。</p>
<p>所以，研究中國通貨問題的時候，祗要淸晰認識了它前提條件的差別，就不會感覺過份難於理解，或許特別差異。如果要淸晰認識其前提條件的差異，不僅須研究通貨問題，必須理解一切經濟狀况之後，再可研討對策。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>去年春天，舊法幣價値暴跌的時候，日本　敎授，曾對中國的金融界人士提出過這樣一個質問：「你們到底把紙幣當作什麽使用的？我不能明瞭你們對於通貨的觀念如何？」這樣一句問話，竟然使他們着了忙，於是一般日本人以爲中國人對於紙幣的觀念不能理解，又覺得其心理上信任的奇怪。日本人的思想是這樣的，通貨旣爲國家發行管理，那麽對於通貨應該要抱定與信賴國家同樣的信任心，通貨得到這種信用之後，自能暢通。但是中國對於發行管理通貨的政府，雖然沒有這樣信賴，可是中國的通貨，照常維持其價値流通。但看大東亞戰爭發生後的舊法幣，雖然與管理此通貨的政府及發行銀行絕緣，然而還是照常流通，在這種狀態的中國，對政府的信賴，與對通貨的信用，完全分開，任憑發行者，管理者境况如何，通貨還是照樣流通。這一點，無怪叫人不能理解一般經濟理論。</p>
<p>而且日本人把通貨當作財寳，對於通貨，抱着神秘的信任，但是中國人不當紙幣是財寳，更沒有神秘的信任，日本人有了財寳的觀念，大家要儲蓄，而且非常愛護紙幣。中國人雖是愛財甚於生命的國民，然而對於紙幣的儲蓄觀念極薄，更不重視紙幣，此點就日本方面來看，亦屬不可思議者，且爲苦於理解者，但是想到中國的前提條件差別時，就容易理解，也不會感覺特別奇怪了。按中國在幣制沒有改革以前，因爲幣政分離，而且民間不能透澈幣政分離的觀念，他們祇知道硬幣的觀念，把硬幣常做寳貝，他們不知道紙幣和硬幣是同樣的，更未考慮到紙幣是代表硬幣的，單純的偏見認爲紙幣不過是流通手段，站在這種單純的立塲上，所以收到了紙幣，就把它去購進現物，於是紙幣果然成了「紙幣」的效用。</p>
<p>換句話說，中國的政治力，向來是薄弱的，所以流通多半在社會基礎上，通貨被人認爲僅是流通的手段，於是包含在通貨變動因素中的政治上基礎比率，比了其他塲合更低，對於政治的信賴和通貨本身的信用，就起了異感，把通貨認爲僅是社會上流通手段，當然不把通貨常作財寳，那裏會有神秘的信用呢？所以政治的信賴低落，不拿通貨當作財寳，也沒有神秘的信任，然而並不能以此就斷定中國人對通貨的信用低落。據日本人的看法，認爲是低，然而以中國人立塲來看，自覺已有充分的信任。某一個時期，中國金融人士與對於通貨的信任，被人議論過。有某一個日本人，問過這樣一句話：「中國人對於紙幣的信任，非常之低。」但是中國人的回答道：「現在對於通貨的信用，決不是低，應該說是良好。」這種所見之不同；是由於觀念上的基礎倏件不同而產生的，中國人當通貨是流通手段，所以通貨祇要有流通的功用，就可以說對紙幣信用良好。</p>

<h3>「惻隱之心」</h3>
<p>— 枕琱戈</p>
<p>我們中國人，對於保存而更發揚「先聖明哲」的敎訓，一向是不遺餘力的；就像「亞聖一孟子所吿訴我們的「無惻隱之心非人也」之類，凡是「人」就無不「布乎四體，形乎動靜」的。</p>
<p>「惻隱之心」是儒家的說法，在佛家就是「慈悲心」，在我們普通人就是「同情心」。</p>
<p>就好比說，一個吸毒的叫化子向你討錢，雖然你明知他之所以爲叫化子，以前一定是不學好，就是現在，還是不學好；但是，你聽到他的哀聲下氣，情不自禁地就給他錢了。但是，當你看到大奸劇盜被殺頭，殺父的逆子被紋決，雖然他沒有搶過你的東西，雖然你不是他的老子，但你決不會喟然而嘆：「這些官員，這些劊子手眞沒有「惻隱之心」啊！」相反地，你會喊出「好啊好啊」來。</p>
<p>爲什麼兩者都可使人「惻隱」而結果不同呢？這就是因爲前者給與你厭惡少於「惻隱」，後者給與你的厭惡多於「惻隱」；前者對社會沒有大害，而後者則是社會之蠢。</p>
<p>所以，施與「惻隱之心」的對象是有條件性的：有的可以施與，有的就簡直不能，那就像大奸劇盜，逆子，囤虎之類是，對他們祗有秉公辦理！</p>
<h3>觀「金絲雀」演出</h3>
<p>— 梅御</p>
<p>「中旅」捲土重來，已在麗華上演「金絲雀」，這是一部叙述歌舞女郎的故事。</p>
<p>周貽白的戲劇，素爲人們所推重，「金絲雀」是他的新作，充分地表現了悲喜劇的成就，比較上，喜劇的成份占了多數。</p>
<p>在演出上，羅蘭是最有美滿成績的一人，很能按照劇中人的性格去做，第一幕中，她演敷衍一個大腹賈那種妖媚的表情，逼眞之至，大可與唐若靑在「日出」中的陳白露，媲美一下。</p>
<p>國語的流俐淸晰，態度的自然，都是羅蘭成功之點，相信她，未來的成就未可限量。</p>
<p>大腹賈趙國元，由李景波演出，演技老鍊，表情深動，並且他導演是劇，也有理想的成功，能把全劇處置得很輕鬆，活潑，處處可以引人發笑。</p>
<p>藍靑瘋瘋顚顚做作，亦足可取，陳玉麟目作聰明的神情，亦是是劇成功的一人，林納演洪玉蘭，亦極能抓住了個性去做。</p>
<p>最足引人發笑是第三幕，龍顧氏鬧到趙國元家裏，幾乎無時無刻不在使觀衆們發出熱鬧滿意的笑聲。</p>
<p>比較欠缺的是龍德標的飾演者，也許因爲經騐關係！表情上，國語上，都較其他角色爲弱。</p>
<p>湯琦之歌舞團主，處處地方都是戲的表現，很都抓住觀衆注意力。</p>
<p>總括全劇的演出者，都很努力，在眼前所演戲劇中，是値得觀看的一部，並且像這種典型的戲，很合觀衆們的胃口，因爲它很合乎喜劇的條件。</p>
<h3>陽春小集</h3>
<p>— 江渢</p>
<p>修養，可分爲「積極」的與「消極」的二類。前者能使我人認識社會，認識自己，鍛鍊品性，增進學識，培養與生活奮鬥的勇氣，鼓勵我人在人生大道上向前邁進。後者却只能使我人消極，使我人糊塗，敎我人躱避現實，萬事須「退一步想」……不瞻望前面而回顧後面，或者只是停滯於現狀中，不思改良，不想上進。</p>
<p>我們所需要的修養：是「積極」的；而不是「消極」的！</p>
<p>滿足並不能祛除「煩惱」；相反地，有時反能延長「煩惱」，增進「煩惱」。若沒有人因不滿足當時處境而發明電燈，電話，輪船，飛機……的話；我們現在不是還要因爲種種不便而「煩惱」着嗎？</p>
<p>只有對現實有明晰的認識，對人生意義有正確的把握，對未來有光明理想的人；才能不爲一時的艱苦和不滿而苦悶，才能永不爲「煩惱」的毒蛇所綑縛！</p>
<p>大無畏的精神，必須配以正確的目光和堅決的意志，才能有所作爲。否則，只是匹夫之勇而巳，沒有什麼價値的。</p>
<p>司梯芬孫，愛迪生等歷史上的偉人，若沒有正確的目光和判斷力，僅本着大無畏的精神，一味瞎闖；那他們的理想，便和「握起了頭髮就想騰空而走」相似，即使埋頭苦幹，也永無實現希望。同樣，沒有堅決的意志，不能持久，那麼，前功畫棄，功虧一簣，一切努力也是枉然的。</p>
<h3>郎才女貌</h3>
<p>— 耶魯</p>
<p>結婚典禮的塲合，證婚人或來賓致詞之中，大抵脫不了「郎才女貌」之類的恭維的話。這於當事人眞是「投其所好」，而在觀禮的佳賓對之，也不免起着羨慕之心。</p>
<p>「女爲悅己者容」，足以認爲可悅者，必求其容貌之美：而「雀屏中選」的所謂如意郎君，也必以才爲上。無怪乎舊小說裏的「才子佳人」的事蹟，不知被多少男女津津樂道，而且連自己也儼然有「才子」「佳人」的氣槪。這大概也是人所企求的欲望之一嗎？</p>
<p>現在的婚姻方式以及男女的擇偶理想，雖跟從前有許多不同，但是「郎才女貌」這一炫耀的濃厚的觀念，仍是深錮人心，似乎惟有這樣，才算「門當戶對」，於是男有才幹女具姿色的「秦晋之好」，安得不令人稱羨。</p>
<p>其實，買賣式的婚姻，仍舊很多，男子可以不問其「才」，祗求其「財」，女子却不可不有「如花如玉」的美貌。所以在有些塲合，譽之爲「郎才女貌」，與其說是恭維，毋寗說是諷刺，並且含有蔑視女性的意味。</p>
<p>因爲可以倚仗金錢權勢買到靑春少女，所以有「才」的少，而「貌」美的多。可是靑春易逝，安能永保駐顏有術，於是問題就多起來了！</p>
<p>所以我認爲男子必須要有一些才氣，至於女子不要祇具「秀外」的美貌，而更要有「慧中」的賢智。</p>
<h3>保姆！女子的新職業</h3>
<p>— 翊羣</p>
<p>近來常常看到徵求保姆的廣吿，這正象徵社會對保姆的需要。保育兒童的確是母親們最大的心事，在女子力爭經濟獨立的時候，兒童的保育是最難解決的問題；交付給無知的女傭，固然放心不下，親自管敎，又覺得個人的時間和精力太小敷，而社會上却也不乏人士，拿出「兒童需人敎育」的招牌高唱着「婦女回家庭管孩子去」的論調，並且事實上正有不少有爲的女子被孩子困在家裏，一籌莫展。實在孩子在家庭中生長却也並非十全十美的事，無知的女子固然敎不出好孩子，即使在「良母」卵翼之下長大，　在「羣性」的發展方而，已經打了很大的折扣，本來天性好羣的孩子，因爲自幼在小圈子中過日子，漸漸養成孤獨怕羞的脾氣，大大影響了他的社交生活成爲終身的缺憾。所以近代從事兒童保育事業的人，莫不先後設立幼稚園，托兒所等機關，希望减除婦女的痛苦，發展兒童的本能。上海近來也有人注意及此，但是托兒所，幼稚園中大量所需要的保姆，却必需受過訓練，有相當學識的纔能勝任，普通的女傭完全不合格，另一方面私人家庭中也漸漸感覺兒童保育的重要，時常徵求有學識的保姆。爲了適應社會的需要，上海女靑年會創設立了保姆訓練班，五年以來會訓練了許多的保育人材，爲將來的兒童保育事業奠定一個新基礎，同時也符合了部份家庭的渴望；再一方面也是爲着一般對於兒童有濃厚興趣並對保育事業有新信心的女子打開一條工作的道路。這件事情的實行是値得提倡的，更希望婦女界們能够參加和發展這工作。</p>
<p>又據聞女靑年會保姆第六屆訓練班現正開站招生，三個月讀書，三個月實習，有志於兒童保育工作之女子可逕向該會接洽。</p>
<h3>以女性名字名路之競華路</h3>

<h3>生命</h3>
<p>— 宗文</p>
<p>生長在這暴風雨時代裏的人們，我說都是幸福的，偉大的。因爲在現實環境中，沒有痛苦的生活，決不能反映出我們新鮮的生命。</p>
<p>當我的頭初埋在水中時，覺得很黑暗，但一掙出水面時，又和平時一樣的光明，這是吾象徵着人生前途的黑暗與光明，是由自己去操縱的！</p>
<h3>難爲情</h3>
<p>— 張心</p>
<p>難爲情是人類一種天賦的本能，通常都在社交生活中顯露，例如與衆人見面，與名人相遇，與尊長碰頭，或與異性會晤等，會臉紅出汗，忸怩不安，在這種情形之下，交結朋友不會順利：這可以說是難爲情的壞處。</p>
<p>爲什麼難爲情呢？是怕人家看出自己的劣點，給人家心裏輕視，嘲笑，斥責或批評，於是出之以逃避，以躱開難爲情的環境爲快。</p>
<p>可是，我們得注意：這只是暫時的難爲情，只有別人在自己的旁邊才會發生，別人離開時，無論怎樣的難爲情都可消掉，其實於難爲情的事的本身，是沒有關係的。</p>
<p>見利忘義，道德毫無的人，只要沒有人在身邊，更會痛快地表現出他的劣點，不覺得難爲情，幾曾見有「淸夜自思，汗顏無已」的，獨個兒難爲情的嫩臉皮呢？</p>
<p>所以，難爲情與否，不在對「人」，尤在對「己」；不在暫時，而在恒久，不在片面，而在全體，如果常常都獨個兒覺得難爲情，那末，便會重人格，輕利祿，明是非，惜名譽，一洗自已的劣點，使行事做人，無憾於世，這使是難爲情的好處。</p>
<p>這個世界倒需要一些難爲情的自覺，雖然難爲情有好有壞，但我們要揚棄其壞處，採取其好處，不然的話，滔滔者天下皆不難爲情，試問這個世界成個什麼世界？</p>

<h3>Realizing a Wartime National Economic Life</h3>
<p>The current world war is a total war, and its ultimate victory or defeat depends not only on the front lines of both sides, but more importantly on the labor of every citizen—especially the wartime form of national economic life. Therefore, whether it is Japan and Germany, or the Soviet Union and the United States, they have to exert all their greatest labor to extremely concentrate the national strength and resources of the whole country, and have to require and force the people of the whole country to endure the greatest sacrifices and sufferings, moving from the peacetime economic life state to the wartime national economic life state, in order to save the nation's time and spirit, and all living and inanimate forces, and concentrate them in the hands of the national government, so as to closely cooperate with the national policy of war and strive for the final victory.</p>
<p>This kind of wartime national economic life has been implemented in Germany for several years, and it has become more tense and stricter with the development of the war, making the people's daily life in line with the requirements of the country, without misusing a penny of money, wasting a bit of material, and actively making their every move conducive to the implementation of the national policy. However, the government still feels insufficient, so since the winter of 1942-43, under the advocacy of Goebbels, it has launched a total mobilization movement in Europe, in order to make the people of all European countries under the leadership of the Axis powers fully enter the wartime national economic life state of final battle preparation, so as to cooperate with the Axis powers' strategy in 1943 and strive for the final victory.</p>
<p>Our friendly nation, Japan, has entered a state of combat in its national economic life, which is even more so than Germany. Therefore, the country can smoothly concentrate and control all the power and resources of the whole country, and carry out the war of "invincible" and "unbeatable." However, the Japanese government and the public are not satisfied with this, and still demand the tension and concentration of all the power of the people at any time, and the thorough realization of the national wartime economic life, so that there is no waste of any power. This month on the 22nd, the Asahi Shimbun editorial clearly pointed out: "The fundamental goal of Japan's wartime economic policy is how to make the people endure pain and how to make the people endure hardship." The reason for this is that "in order for Japan to defeat Britain and the United States, which have absolute economic superiority, the Japanese people must endure more wartime living sacrifices than the people of Britain and the United States, so as to make up for the lack of economic power."</p>
<p>Now let us ask how is the wartime life of each of our citizens? It is true that we have always prided ourselves on "vast land, large population, and abundant products," but after six years of war, coupled with the division of the two regimes of Chongqing and the Communists, and the consumption of natural disasters and bandits, to be honest, China's population has been drastically reduced, and China's products have been withering, and it is no longer "a vast land with abundant resources." Even if we don't talk about building a new China, cooperating in the war of liberation in East Asia, and preserving the vitality of the country and the nation, in order to seek the revival of the people, it is already extremely difficult. Although our friendly nation, Japan, is now treating us equally, giving us a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to extricate ourselves and save ourselves, if we still only know how to shout a few beautiful and pleasant slogans, write a few articles praising achievements and whitewashing peace, and the upper and lower levels are lax and scattered as before, may I ask what qualifications do we have to talk about equality with the great powers of Japan, Germany, and Italy. Moreover, if we do not take this opportunity to become nervous and invigorated, and take on the mission of the times for our country and East Asia, then how can we stand in the new world in the future; and what face do we have today to speak empty words of defending the rear and cooperating with the front line?</p>
<p>The decisive period of the world war is approaching, and the comprehensive implementation of the wartime national economic life is already imminent. With the successful national mobilization work of Japan and the strict national economic life of Japan, the Japanese public opinion circles are especially using the difficulty of fighting the superior Britain and the United States to warn their government and the public, and to persuade the people to endure pain and sacrifice, and move forward along the line of increasing combat power. We are lagging behind Japan in everything, and everyone only knows how to talk on paper, and is unwilling to endure the pain of spirit and body; there are even many people who take advantage of the opportunity to speculate and hoard, squander at will, and enjoy themselves to the fullest, which is not only a long way from national prosperity and strength and the liberation of East Asia, but is simply a phenomenon of national destruction. We first hope that the high-ranking officials of the central and local governments today will immediately wake up and everyone will have the ambition to set an example for the people. We also hope that social leaders will encourage each other and lead the masses. But at the same time, we must point out that the vast majority of the Chinese people are struggling today under the minimum standard of living. Therefore, when the authorities promote the national wartime economic life, so that the people can endure pain and hardship, on the one hand, they should use methods such as persuasion, warning, and encouragement, and on the other hand, they should always carefully observe the people's hidden troubles and grievances, and strive for everyone to fight for the country, the nation, and the liberation of East Asia, and no one can seize by trickery and obtain huge profits alone.</p>
<p>In summary, the wartime national economic life is that all the people live a life of the same standard. Of course, there is no talk of enjoyment and entertainment, and enduring hardship must be average and equal. For living resources, the quantity must be average; the quality must be equal. If the majority of the people are already struggling under the minimum standard of living, and a few people are still enjoying themselves to the fullest, then morally, they should be ashamed, not to mention the major premise of contributing to the total war effort! Therefore, the realization of wartime life should start from the "upper-class elements" spontaneously and voluntarily.</p>

<h3>The Chongqing Army in Southern Shanxi is on the Verge of Collapse, and the Remaining Generals Continue to Surrender. Zhu Ziming, Commander of the Marine Corps in the Shandong-Jiangsu Area, Has Defected. The Chongqing Army that Crossed the Yellow River and Invaded Shanxi Province Was Annihilated.</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanxi Front, 26th. On the evening of the 23rd, the Japanese army captured 260 cadres of the 24th Army Group of the Chongqing Army near Sijiajing. Among those who have been identified are Major General Yu Guanghui, commander of the 41st Independent Advance Column of the Hebei-Chahar War Zone, and 53 senior generals such as Colonel Yang Zhixi and Wu Changheng. In addition, other Japanese troops captured 346 soldiers of the newly formed 5th Army of Chongqing near Woyang City, four kilometers west of Linhong, at about 4 pm on the 24th. Among them, there were also 49 senior officers, including Colonel Hou Kuanwen. Therefore, in this encirclement and annihilation battle launched by the Japanese army in this area, due to the surrender of Sun Dianying, commander of the newly formed 5th Army of Chongqing, the generals of the army had completely lost their will to fight, so their senior generals were captured by the Japanese army one after another.</p>
<p>Southern Shanxi Front, 25th. This annihilation operation by the Japanese army against the 24th Army Group of Chongqing is a major new operation after the Battle of Central Hebei last year. After Sun Dianying, commander of the newly formed 5th Army of Chongqing, surrendered, the Japanese army launched attacks on the enemy from all directions, resulting in the continuous surrender and cooperation of enemy generals, and achieving great results. Especially when the Japanese army took encirclement actions against the 24th Army Group of Chongqing, it was extremely secretive beforehand, so it was able to completely encircle it in one fell swoop, and launched a dozen fierce attacks on the 27th Army of Chongqing, which was entrenched in the steep area of Meishi Town in the Taihang Mountains. The enemy army was unable to resist and mostly fled into the mountains to avoid the sharp edge of the Japanese army. As a result of this operation, Hu Changqing, commander of the 45th Division of Chongqing, was killed in battle, and the enemy army was almost completely destroyed. The Japanese army's thunderous operation has entered the final stage, and the elite of the Japanese army is still in pursuit. At this point, the only counter-offensive attempt of the remaining Chongqing army in North China has completely failed.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 26th. According to a telegram from the Japanese front line in southern Shanxi, about 10,000 Chongqing troops retreated to the mountainous area connecting Nanping and Tianjiajing in the southeast of Linqi, a certain number of kilometers away from the provincial border, and were encircled by the Japanese army. On the night of the 24th, the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on them. By the 25th, the Chongqing army realized that resistance was futile, and successively participated in the peace movement. After Major General Hou Ruxi, commander of the "40th Army Guerrilla Detachment" of Chongqing, announced his participation in the peace movement, two "brigade commander" class major generals (names unknown) of the Chongqing army in the Zhaijing area northwest of Linhong also led their troops to participate in the peace movement. At this point, the command system of the Chongqing army was in great chaos, and its overall collapse was only a matter of time. According to prisoners, Hu Changqing (erroneously written as Hu Kaiqing yesterday), "commander of the 45th Division of the 27th Army" of Chongqing, had been killed in battle near Lingchuan, and Cui Yuzhou, "commander of the 39th Division of the 40th Army," was still wandering in the mountains due to fear of a sudden Japanese attack.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 26th. According to the Japanese front line in the border area of Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan provinces, after the Japanese army attacked the Chongqing army's stronghold in the area north of Linhong, the main force of the "5th Army" of Chongqing had fled to the mountains west of Linqi, but a part of the "3rd Division" and "4th Division" of Chongqing had been intercepted by the Japanese army near Zhangcun Sizhai in the northwest of Linhong, and their annihilation was imminent.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Jinan, 26th. General Zhu Ziming, commander of the Marine Corps of the Chongqing-Shandong-Jiangsu War Zone, has recently realized that resistance is futile and has decided to lead his 1,200 troops to join General Wu Huawen's Shandong Army to launch a fierce attack on the 51st Army of Chongqing. Currently, the Chongqing and Communist armies in central Shandong have been greatly shaken by General Zhu Ziming's participation in the peace camp.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th. The troops under General Wu Huawen, commander-in-chief of the Shandong Army of the National Government, launched a fierce battle with Zhou Guanglie, commander of the 51st Army of Chongqing, and Liu Guitang, commander of the newly formed 36th Division, in Shandong Province at dawn on the 12th of this month. They always adopted a courageous offensive and severely damaged the Chongqing army. As of the 19th, 1,900 bodies of the Chongqing army were found, 200 people were captured, and 11 light machine guns and 207 rifles were seized.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th. According to a telegram from the southern Shanxi front on the 26th, about 400 soldiers of Zhu Yaoguang's troops of Chongqing crossed the Yellow River on the night of the 31st and invaded the area near Kangjiaping, eight kilometers east of Meng County at the southern end of Shanxi Province. However, the Japanese army had foreseen their attempt and immediately launched a fierce attack on them, annihilating them. The results of this battle by the Japanese army are as follows: 235 bodies of the Chongqing army were abandoned, 85 people were captured, and the Japanese army seized 3 light machine guns, 50 rifles, 4 pistols, and 1 grenade launcher.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th. According to a telegram from the Japanese front line in the border area of Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan provinces on the 26th, a special work team of a certain unit composed of a team of Chinese soldiers also participated in this operation, cooperating with the Japanese army in guiding the road, transporting food, or entering a village in advance to distribute leaflets and appease the people when the Japanese army passed through the village, which was very active. Moreover, they rescued wounded Japanese soldiers on the front line west of Shuiye Town, and sometimes used the familiar terrain to shoot with rifles when they encountered the Chongqing army. The Japanese army expressed great gratitude for their efforts. Japanese soldiers often shared hard-to-get tobacco with Chinese soldiers, and they looked for water wells for the Japanese army to solve the problem of heat and thirst. This kind of friendly situation of Sino-Japanese integration can be seen everywhere. A certain unit commander of the Japanese army asked them about the meaning of Chinese participation in the war, and they replied that they were most happy to be able to cooperate with the Japanese army in the war, and they are still continuing the war of living and dying together.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th. According to a telegram from the Japanese front line in the border area of Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan provinces, after the Japanese army began to advance on a certain area of the Beijing-Hankou Railway on the 20th, it surrounded 30,000 soldiers of the 40th Army of Chongqing in the southwest corner, and besieged them for several days since the 24th. As a result, the Chongqing army in that area had collapsed and fled in all directions, hiding in the mountains and nearby villages. However, after a thorough search by the Japanese army, most of them had been captured. As of the 25th, 1,000 bodies of the Chongqing army had been identified (including 5 regimental commanders), and 900 people had been captured (including 5 guerrilla zone leaders and other generals, 2 regimental commanders, and 50 field officers). In addition, the Japanese army also seized 1 mortar, 3 heavy machine guns, 20 light machine guns, 600 rifles, 6 wireless radios, and many other military supplies.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th. According to a telegram from the southern Taihang Mountains in southern Shanxi on the 26th, after the elite troops of the Japanese army smashed the strongholds of the Chongqing army in Lin County, Linqi, and Lingchuan, they launched a sweeping war on the 25th. The main force of the Chongqing army fled in all directions to the south of Lingchuan due to the rapid pursuit of the Japanese advancing troops. Moreover, the remnants of the Chongqing army near Lin County were in a state of collapse after the Japanese army broke into Linqi. Moreover, the Japanese advancing troops overcame difficult terrain and pursued the remnants of the Chongqing army. On the morning of the 26th, they had advanced to a certain place and echoed a certain unit of the Japanese army advancing south to launch a major annihilation battle. As of the 26th, the comprehensive results of the northward troops were as follows: 3,200 soldiers of the Chongqing army were captured, 1,000 bodies were abandoned, and the Japanese army seized 1,000 rifles, 93,000 bullets, 1,700 pistols, 350 light machine guns, 2 heavy machine guns, 3 pursuit guns, 1,010 hand grenades, 2 wireless radios, 3 telephones, 3,100 pieces of military clothing, and 120 military horses.</p>
<h3>Special Envoy Chu Meets with the Japanese Emperor to Present the Tongguang Grand Cordon</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th. Chu Minyi, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, in his capacity as a special ambassador, met with His Majesty the Japanese Emperor at the Imperial Palace at 10:20 this morning. After presenting the Tongguang Grand Cordon awarded by Chairman Wang to His Majesty the Japanese Emperor, he made a statement at the Imperial Hotel here, saying in essence: Today, I, in my capacity as a special ambassador of the National Government, met with His Majesty the Japanese Emperor and presented the Tongguang Grand Cordon awarded by Chairman Wang to His Majesty the Japanese Emperor. I am deeply honored to have received the words of His Majesty the Japanese Emperor. Recalling that I have met with His Majesty the Japanese Emperor several times as the former Ambassador to Japan and as an attendant to Chairman Wang, I have received many favors from His Majesty and have been able to complete the important tasks entrusted to me. I feel infinitely honored and grateful.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th. Chairman Wang of the National Government was previously awarded the Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum by His Majesty the Japanese Emperor. This time, he specially awarded the Tongguang Grand Cordon, the highest order of our country, to His Majesty the Japanese Emperor, and dispatched Foreign Minister Chu as a special ambassador. Special Envoy Chu, accompanied by staff members Zhang Chao, Minister Plenipotentiary, Xue Fengyuan, Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Xu Yizong, Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and others, met with His Majesty the Japanese Emperor on the 26th to present the Tongguang Grand Cordon. At 10:15 am on the same day, Special Envoy Chu and his staff were guided by the officials of the House of Peers and took a car specially dispatched by the Imperial Palace from the Imperial Hotel, passing through the main gate of the Nijubashi Bridge to the Imperial Palace. After arriving at the palace at 10:20, they were guided by the officials of the House of Peers to the Phoenix Room with Xu Liang, our Minister Plenipotentiary to Japan. At 10:30, His Majesty the Japanese Emperor, accompanied by Minister of the Imperial Household Agency Matsudaira, Chief Aide-de-Camp Hyakutake, and Aide-de-Camp to the Emperor Renuma, entered the Phoenix Room. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu also stood by. First, Ambassador Xu introduced Special Envoy Chu to meet with His Majesty the Japanese Emperor. His Majesty the Emperor shook hands with him. Then, Special Envoy Chu delivered a speech on his visit to Japan and presented Chairman Wang's highest order of the Allied nation, the Tongguang Grand Cordon, and the National Government's letter of presentation of the order. His Majesty the Japanese Emperor instructed Translator Shimizu to give generous words. Then, Special Envoy Chu introduced staff member Zhang Chao and others to meet with His Majesty the Emperor successively. The special envoy and his party left the palace at 11 o'clock.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th. The National Government presented the Tongguang Grand Cordon to His Majesty the Japanese Emperor on the 26th. The Japanese Emperor sent a telegram to Chairman Wang of the National Government on the same day to express his gratitude.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th. Chu Minyi, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, visited the Yasukuni Shrine on the 25th with Zhang , Minister Plenipotentiary, and paid his respects before the shrine like ordinary visitors, expressing his heartfelt gratitude to the spirits of Yasukuni. Then he went to visit the Yushukan, and then drove back to the hotel and made a statement as follows: "This is my fifth visit to the Yasukuni Shrine, but it is my first time to visit on the day of the Grand Festival. I am deeply impressed by the sincerity of the crowds of visitors who followed each other in paying respects to the spirits."</p>
<h3>Strictly Enforce the Prohibition of Gambling. Order from Chairman Wang to the Capital Garrison Headquarters</h3>
<p>Chairman Wang of the Military Commission issued a special order to the Capital Garrison Headquarters to strictly prohibit gambling, in order to cultivate the spirit of national self-discipline and self-restraint and to complete the wartime life of frugality and diligence, as it is the time to promote the New National Movement and the whole country is participating in the war with all its strength. After receiving the order, the headquarters drafted detailed measures and submitted them to the Military Commission for approval. It has been implemented since the 26th, strictly prohibiting gambling, and the rampant gambling style in the capital will be swept away.</p>
<p>The harm of gambling is known to everyone. Perhaps the gamblers themselves know it more clearly than the average person, but immersed in it, they cannot extricate themselves for a long time. If the government does not take decisive measures, the gambling style will become more and more prevalent, and the future will be even more unimaginable. Therefore, this time the capital's strict prohibition of gambling is a necessary and effective measure.</p>
<p>The measures for prohibiting gambling have been announced and the implementation has begun, but the success or failure of the results still depends on "human effort." The reason why something cannot achieve the expected results is definitely not because the method or policy is wrong. Nine times out of ten, it is to blame for the lack of "human effort." The prohibition of gambling is certainly no exception. If the gambling style cannot be eradicated, then the executor should bear full responsibility.</p>
<p>The vigorous prohibition of gambling should not only be done in Nanjing, but also in all parts of the country, because the gambling style in various places has been too prevalent in the past few years. Every family has gambling tools, and every household has the sound of mahjong. In particular, the gambling tool stores are lined up on the market, which makes people feel the terrible gambling style. We hope that the Military Commission will go a step further and order the security headquarters of all provinces to strictly implement the measures for prohibiting gambling in the capital, so that the lives of the people across the country can be brought into the right track to meet the needs of the war.

<h3>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is Restored to Traffic, and a Grand Opening Ceremony is Held. The Shanghai-Jinhua Train is Also Scheduled to be Completed Within the Year.</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Jinhua, 26th. Last May, the Japanese army launched two major operations in eastern Zhejiang and Zhejiang-Jiangxi. After the area was secured by the Japanese army, the Japanese authorities and the Central China Railway Company jointly started the work of restoring the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, which progressed very rapidly. At present, except for the construction of the Qiantang River Railway Bridge, all 187 kilometers of the project between Hangzhou and Jinhua have been completed. Starting from the 25th, the Central China Railway Company began to run direct trains between the Jingjiang River Bank on the opposite bank of the Qiantang River in Hangzhou and Jinhua. At 6:00 am on the 25th, the Central China Railway Company simultaneously dispatched the first train from Hangzhou and Jinhua. At 11:00 am, a grand and enthusiastic opening ceremony of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was held in Jinhua. In addition to Mr. Takashima, Vice President of the Central China Revitalization Company, Mr. Uetsuji, and other representatives of the Central China Company, as well as Vice President Tian of the Central China Railway Company, more than 150 Chinese and Japanese military and political officials attended. After the ceremony, Mr. Sato, Director of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Maintenance Bureau of the Central China Railway Company, delivered the opening speech, followed by Vice President Tian reading the eulogy, guests delivering congratulatory speeches, the person in charge reporting on the progress of the project, and awarding commendations and citations to those who had made contributions. The meeting was then adjourned. On that day, residents along the line and in the neighboring areas of Jinhua, such as Lanxi and Wuyi, came to participate upon hearing the news, making Jinhua a place filled with celebration all day long, and the grand occasion was unprecedented.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Jinhua, 26th. After the opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, Hangzhou, Jinhua, Yushan and other places have been connected, and the important arteries of the three provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Hunan, from Shanghai in the east to Nanchang, Jiujiang, Zhuzhou, etc. in the west, have also been opened up, so its position is extremely important. This road was previously destroyed by the Chongqing army. After the Japanese army moved in, it decided to repair it with the Central China Railway Company. The first phase of the repair work between Meichi and Jinhua was started on October 1 last year. The second phase also started on December 1 last year and was completed on April 20 this year, so it can be reached from Hangzhou through Meichi to Jinhua. The authorities have now decided to start the third phase of the project in August to repair the Qiantang River Railway Bridge, which is scheduled to be completed within this year. In addition, the construction of the Zhichu River between Jinhua and Wuyi will start soon, and the direct traffic between Shanghai, Hangzhou and Jinhua is also scheduled to be completed within this year. In the future, with the progress of the Greater East Asia War, when building the Greater East Asia Railway connecting Tokyo and Chonam, or the Asia-Europe connecting railway, this line will be one of the world's railways, and its position will become more and more important. In addition, after the opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the economic development of the area will definitely make rapid progress in the future. The area was originally the largest granary in Central China, with extremely abundant agricultural products such as rice, wheat, millet, tea, tobacco leaves, flax, silk, cotton, and tung oil. In addition, mineral products, forest products, and livestock products are also very rich. Among them, the development of fluorite mines near Jinhua is particularly important, because this is an indispensable important resource in the Greater East Asia War. And its reserves rank first in the world, and the quality is also excellent, so since October last year, the Central China Mining Company has started partial mining. It is heard that fluorite veins have also been found near Wuyi, with reserves accounting for more than 60% of the world's total. In addition, tung oil, which is an important material for wartime, is also exported a lot with Jinhua as the center. From this, we can see that the various rich materials in eastern Zhejiang have made great contributions to the Greater East Asia War, so the opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is also of great significance in economic terms.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Jinhua, 26th. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line connects Hangzhou, Jinhua, Yushan and other places, and its position is extremely important. After the Chongqing army destroyed the Qiantang River Railway Bridge, which had just been completed in the 26th year of the Republic of China, the railway line was completely destroyed. After the Japanese army launched the Zhejiang-Jiangxi operation in May of the 31st year and eliminated the Chongqing army, the Japanese army engineering team and the Central China Railway Company jointly started the first phase of the project, which was 135 kilometers long between Meichi and Jinhua, on October 1. By December 8, light rail trains could be operated, and on April 1 of this year,  rail trains started to operate again. The second phase of the project (40 kilometers long from the Jingjiang River Bank on the opposite bank of Hangzhou to Meichi) started construction on December 1 last year and was completed on April 20 this year, and the entire line of 176 kilometers from the Jingjiang River Bank through Meichi to Jinhua was opened to traffic. In addition, the repair work of the Qiantang River Railway Bridge is listed as the third phase of the project, and will continue to start construction in August of this year, and is expected to be completed within the year. In addition, the new railway line between Jinhua and Wuyi is also scheduled to start construction recently. The main line between Shanghai, Hangzhou and Jinhua, as well as the branch line between Jinhua and Wuyi, can generally be completed within this year. The repair work of the entire line of 176 kilometers from the Jingjiang River Bank to Jinhua, which was opened to traffic this time, was almost the same as building a new line. However, the result took only six months to complete the entire project, which is a new record in the history of world railway construction. After the start of this project, Chinese employees and residents along the line gave great assistance. The highest number of laborers employed locally reached 15,000, and the total number of workers in the entire project reached 1 million. Due to the cooperation of residents in various places, bandits have no room for activity. In addition, the area is a timber production area, so construction materials such as sleepers are self-sufficient, which has greatly helped the progress of the project. In addition, the area around Jinhua is adjacent to the areas ruled by Chongqing and Wan , so the opening of the entire line this time also has a great impact on the residents of the Chongqing area, and its significance is extremely important in military, political and economic aspects.</p>

<p>Syonan, 26th (Central News Agency) - The atmosphere here has suddenly become excited with the visit of Japanese Minister Aoki for Greater East Asia. Everyone believes that the construction achievements of the past year have been given an opportunity to be showcased, and they are deeply gratified. Minister Aoki for Greater East Asia has traveled extensively throughout Vietnam, Thailand, and Burma in less than ten days since starting his inspection tour, holding candid discussions with the authorities of each country, reaffirming their joint efforts to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Now he has come to Syonan, the center of the South, for an on-site inspection, which will surely transmit the essence of Southern management and the current military and political situation to Japan and the people in various parts of Greater East Asia. The local people will also work harder to build the region because of the visit of Minister Aoki for Greater East Asia. It is recalled that when the news of Minister Aoki for Greater East Asia's visit to the South was first announced, the residents here were deeply moved, believing that the personal guidance of the responsible Japanese authorities was sufficient to show Japan's sincerity in the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere.

<h3>US Aircraft Carrier Langley Sunk in the Atlantic, the Seventh Since the US Entered the War</h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - Officials announced tonight: The American 14,500-ton aircraft carrier "Langley" was sunk in the North Atlantic by a submarine commanded by German U-boat captain Puhler. Hitler has awarded Puhler the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves to the Iron Cross in recognition of his achievement. The American aircraft carrier "Langley" was responsible for protecting shipping in the Atlantic. Its keel was laid on September 26, 1931, and it was launched on February 25, 1933. It could carry 72 aircraft and had a total crew of 1,788.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to a Stefani news report from London: An anti-Axis convoy has been fighting German submarines in the North Atlantic for three days. On Saturday, German submarines made thirteen attacks.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - The Imperial Headquarters announced on the 26th that the US aircraft carrier "Langley" had been sunk after being heavily attacked by German submarines in the Atlantic waters. This is the first time that a German submarine has sunk an American aircraft carrier. Previously, the German and Italian navies had sunk four British aircraft carriers: "Audacity" 22,500 tons, "Royal Oak" 22,500 tons, "Ark Royal" 26,000 tons, and "Glorious" 25,000 tons. This is the fifth. Although the Langley is a small aircraft carrier with a displacement of 14,500 tons, its number of aircraft and other equipment can match those of a converted large aircraft carrier. It was sunk while escorting a convoy of transport ships. Around the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the American aircraft carriers deployed in the Pacific, which were attacked and sunk one after another by the Japanese Navy, included the "Lexington," "Saratoga," "Yorktown," "Wasp," "Enterprise," and "Hornet." Now, the "Langley" has been lost in the Atlantic. All seven aircraft carriers that the United States had before the start of the Greater East Asia War have been sunk. However, the US Navy, recognizing the importance of aircraft carriers in modern naval warfare, seems to be actively adding to its fleet, such as changing the design of early ships, converting merchant ships into aircraft carriers, and establishing special aircraft carriers.</p>
<p>Significant Losses of Allied Ships</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency: The public announcement of the Truman Committee regarding the amount of shipping losses suffered by the anti-Axis countries in the Atlantic in 1942 has inevitably had some impact in South America. The conservative silence of the British and American naval authorities has led the general public to believe that these losses are not important to the progress of the war. No one doubted the optimistic statements often made by British and American politicians, saying that the number of new ships built exceeded the number of ships sunk. However, in recent times, those who pay attention to the situation have noticed several things that are unsatisfactory, especially in the United States. A well-known newspaper in New York stated that the authorities' concealment of the truth was a foolish move. According to the Prensa newspaper, the cargo that sank to the bottom of the sea with the ships was enough to supply fifty divisions or one million soldiers. As for the official claim that more ships were built than sunk, this was only true in September.</p>
<h3>Iceland to Draft Constitution, Declare Independence Next Summer</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from London: Iceland will separate from Denmark and become independent on June 14, 1944. A committee composed of representatives from various parties has drafted a constitution for the island as a republic. A constitutional government will be established on June 14, 1944, and a president will be elected by parliament to take over the national affairs. The president's term of office will be four years.</p>
<h3>No Change in US-Finnish Relations</h3>
<p>Helsinki, Finland, 26th (Central News Agency) - A radio news commentator in Helsinki, Finland, denied last night the rumors that the departure of US Embassy officials from here to Stockholm, Sweden, on Friday was due to the deterioration of US-Finnish relations. The commentator said that as far as is known here, there has been no change in the diplomatic relations between the two countries, and the rumors that the Soviet Union had proposed to Finland to conclude peace before the US move were also unfounded. At the same time, there are conflicting interpretations here regarding the US withdrawal of embassy personnel. Some authoritative sources believe that this move is harmless and has no political significance whatsoever, while others believe that it is a precursor to the severance of diplomatic relations. The official Finnish communiqué issued here announced the fact of the withdrawal but did not state the reason for it.</p>
<h3>Tensions in Syria</h3>
<p>Ankara, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Reuter's correspondent Smith from Damascus: Since the declaration of a state of siege throughout Syria, the elections of various parties have been hindered because freedom of assembly and speech has been greatly restricted, and the curfew at 8:00 PM has prevented evening election meetings from being held. It seems that the Supreme Commissioner Tego and the British, who secretly control him, as well as the Syrian interim prime minister, are only allowing satisfactory Syrians to be candidates in order to build a suitable parliament. Tego does not want the largest party in Syria, the Nationalist Party, to control everything. Therefore, before the elections began, he arrested the party leader and used the implementation of the state of siege as an excuse to detain other party members with the police, preventing them from participating in the elections. However, the members of the Nationalist Party, hiding in various churches, have begun to generally oppose Tego and the Syrian Prime Minister, and there are many of them. In short, the political atmosphere in Syria has reached a tense stage. Although the authorities do not allow newspapers to publish any news, political observers generally believe that a general political strike will be the result of this domestic tension.</p>

<h3>Axis Forces Launch Strong Counteroffensive, Fierce Battles Raging in Western Tunisia, Strong Defense of Tunisian Ports阻敵, Enemy Offensive Thwarted, US Army Commander McNair Wounded</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to combined reports from the Tunisian front, the British Eighth Army, with the cooperation of American and French forces, launched a general offensive on the western Tunisian front, but did not achieve any results. The center of the fierce fighting is currently in the area between Medjez el-Bab and Bou Arada. The anti-Axis forces in that area lost 87 tanks due to attacks by German Tiger tanks and anti-tank guns. In the area of Sejenane, British commandos attempted to advance but were stopped by the Axis forces' elastic defense, and their attack attempt completely failed. At the same time, in the southern area, the British and New Zealand forces under Montgomery launched local attacks at several points but were repulsed.</p>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - The fierce battle on the western front of the German-Italian defense line is still continuing, and its intensity has not diminished. According to news that can be received here today, it is not yet possible to determine whether the battle has reached its peak. However, the news all states that the reinforcements of the British and American forces are endless, and the anti-Axis forces are constantly adding newly replenished troops to the fighting to make up for the serious losses they have suffered due to attacking the strong Axis line. German official news states that the nature of the fighting in this area has changed. According to Reuters, the British and American forces have had local victories in several places, and the Axis forces are working hard to launch a strong counteroffensive. On the first day of the anti-Axis attack, the German and Italian forces were almost completely able to maintain their positions. Although the British forces achieved local victories in a few places, they were forced to retreat due to the German counteroffensive. The center of the British attack is in the middle of the western flank, and the purpose of their offensive is obviously to advance northeast along the road, most of which is in good condition. After breaking through the Axis line, the anti-Axis forces hoped to advance to Tunis, the center of the area defended by the Axis forces. Although there was still fierce fighting in the Tunisian area on Saturday and yesterday, the Berlin military announced today that the anti-Axis forces have still not achieved any decisive success. The German tank and infantry units attacked by the anti-Axis offensive were assisted by German bombers and close-range fighters.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Washington, the US Department of the Army announced on the 25th that US Army Commander in North Africa, Lieutenant General McNair, was wounded on the Tunisian front on the 23rd of this month.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 26th (Central News Agency) - After US Army Commander Lieutenant General McNair was wounded on the Tunisian front, according to a report from Washington, the US Department of the Army appointed Lieutenant General Lia, commander of the US First Army, as acting Army Commander on the 25th.</p>
<h3>War Spreads to Sicily, Italian Air Force Active in the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>Rome, 25th (Central News Agency) - According to Stefani News Agency, the mouthpiece of the Italian Ministry of Aviation, Air Line News, reported: Although the Axis Air Force in Tunisia has only a few airfields, and they are all concentrated in a small, unprotected area along the coast, they are still able to fight the many with the few and do their best to assist the army in combat. Italian aircraft are currently engaged in attacking enemy motorized and armored units and artillery positions, which has been quite effective. Italian fighters are particularly active in the skies over southeastern Tunisia. At present, the Tunisian war has spread to the Strait of Sicily and Sicily itself. Italian aircraft have been very helpful in protecting the area and escorting convoys.</p>
<p>Rome, 26th (Central News Agency) - The Italian Supreme Command announced today: Italian aircraft sank two enemy cargo ships in the Mediterranean, one weighing 8,000 tons and the other 5,000 tons. Enemy aircraft dropped bombs on Sicily, damaging several houses and killing one civilian. Cagliari was also attacked this morning, and the number of casualties is still unknown. Four Italian aircraft did not return to base in the past few days.</p>
<h3>Germany Implements Wartime Barter System</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to Reuters: Due to the war, the production of most daily necessities has been suspended. In order to meet the needs of individual Germans, a new barter system has emerged. Therefore, advertisements for barter are often seen in the advertisement column of newspapers every day. In order to prevent unscrupulous people from profiting from it, the municipal authorities have hired experts to manage the event, and the results have been excellent. Taking leather shoes as an example, a total of 44,000 pairs have been exchanged in the past three years.</p>
<h3>Three Rainbows Found Over Mondovi</h3>
<p>Rome, 25th (Central News Agency) - According to Reuters news here: Three rainbows were found over Mondovi from 7:00 AM to 9:30 AM this morning. Their positions were different, set off against the blue sky, making it a spectacle. Even astronomical experts have difficulty explaining the reason.</p>
<h3>Soviet Offensive in Novorossiysk Area Repulsed</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 25th (Central News Agency) - The large-scale fighting on the Eastern Front ceased ten days ago on the main battle lines, and has now also stopped in the Kuban area, where there is only local fighting. But this situation does not seem to last long. Tonight, German sources said that the Soviet army had repeatedly tried to recapture the positions it had lost in the Novorossiysk area in the past few days in order to prevent its flanks from being threatened, but this move was unsuccessful. Land fighting in the Kuban area is still hampered by mud. In the past few days, the Soviet army has repeatedly attacked German positions in the swampy area, but has been repulsed by artillery fire, losing 40 boats on the front line and hundreds killed. At the same time, the powerful German air force also assisted the ground troops in attacking Soviet oil stations and ammunition depots.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to Reuters, a report from Moscow says that both sides are busy deploying day and night, and a major battle is expected to occur in the future. Air force activity is particularly intensified in all sections of the Eastern Front.</p>
<h3>A New Significance of the Opium War</h3>
<p>— By Yoshida Tosuke</p>
<p>On the 15th of this month, we published an article by Mr. Yoshida on the problem of commodity prices. We introduced Mr. Yoshida as a person from our friendly nation of Japan who is very familiar with China and also the most sympathetic to China. Today, we are again honored to have Mr. Yoshida write this article, "A New Significance of the Opium War." The result of the Opium War was that Chinese people were poisoned by British imperialism for more than a hundred years, leading them to a state of poverty and weakness. We believe that every compatriot with a national consciousness will never forget this poisonous yoke. However, within our country today, as Mr. Yoshida pointed out in many places, there are still semi-public places where people indulge in opium smoking. These shameless "opium addicts," even if they die in tears and snot from their addiction, are not worth our sympathy. Mr. Yoshida specifically points out that the National Government should achieve a situation where there is not a single "opium addict" within the peaceful areas, as a way to promote the centripetal force that attracts intellectuals under the governance of Chongqing. We deeply sympathize with this profound meaning. - Editor's note</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese masterpiece film "Eternal Fame," which takes opium as its theme, is said to be showing at the Grand Light Cinema these days. Taking this opportunity, a new concern about the new significance of the Opium War will certainly arise among the Chinese intelligentsia. Speaking of the Opium War, it was an immoral war. Even British Prime Minister Gladstone said, "There has never been a war like this one, the cause of which was so unjust; nor has there ever been a war like this one that has brought such lasting shame to England." At that time, British imperialism used some ignorant and uneducated Indians to force the Chinese to buy that poisonous substance that was slowly destroying the health of the Chinese nation. Although opium was not first introduced to China by the British, only Britain used war to force its import into China from beginning to end. The term "opium" was not originally Chinese, but a foreign word transformed from the Arabic "Afyun." In the old days, the term "Afurong," which was close to the original sound, was also used. The use of opium was first invented by the ancient Greeks, passed on by Hippocrates to the Arabs, and then by the Arabs to India. It is said that it had already been introduced to China in the eighth century. When opium was first introduced, it was originally only used for medicinal purposes. However, in the eleventh century, the cultivation of poppies was already quite common throughout China. However, the opium problem became a major social problem only after the British East India Company encouraged the export of opium to China. At that time, a huge amount of China's silver flowed to Britain due to the import of opium. On the eve of the Opium War (1836-37), it had reached a huge sum of 14.5 million yuan. Because of this, the price of silver in the country soared. Originally, one silver dollar could only be exchanged for 700 or 800 copper coins, but by 1838, it had risen to one silver dollar being exchangeable for 1,600 copper coins. As a result, the lives of the general public were very difficult. Commercial capital and usurious capital took advantage of this, further increasing the suffering of the people.</p>
<p>Such a social situation finally awakened the national consciousness and stimulated the Chinese intelligentsia. In that era, scholars and officials such as Xu Naiji, Zhu Zun, Huang Juezi, Yuan Yulin, Xu Qiu, Zhu Chenglie, and Lin Zexu all submitted memorials and opinions to the court regarding the prohibition of opium. Among them, the memorial of Lin Zexu, Governor-General of Huguang, was especially praised by Emperor Daoguang. This was not without reason, because Xu Naiji, Huang Juezi, and others focused on the outflow of silver and based their arguments on financial considerations. In contrast, Lin Zexu based his arguments on the long-term perspective of preserving national strength and advocated banning opium. In his memorial, he said, "If opium is not quickly banned, the country will become poorer and the people will become weaker. In a few decades, not only will there be no funds to raise, but there will also be no soldiers to use." His doctrine, standing on the viewpoint of nationalism, greatly moved Emperor Daoguang. That is, he believed that in order to preserve national strength, opium must be banned no matter what. In his view, using financial concerns as the basis for the opium issue was an extremely weak argument. Subsequently, when discussing the opium problem in China, it was often impossible to transcend the opposition between the financial position and the position of preserving national strength. Progressive intellectuals believed that even if there were any financial difficulties, opium should absolutely be banned for the sake of the survival of the Chinese nation. Lin Zexu was indeed the first person to raise this demand and launch a lofty challenge to British imperialism.</p>
<p>At that time, opium accounted for 54 percent of Britain's trade with China. British imperialism did not have the philanthropy to give up such benefits for the sake of the happiness of the Asian nation. For this reason, Britain brazenly used force to deal with the legitimate demands of the Chinese nation that were related to its survival. At the same time, through the Treaty of Nanjing, it opened concessions in China's five major ports as a permanent route for its opium imports. If the Treaty of Nanjing ignores opium, it will not grasp the essence of the treaty. After the Opium War, the British government lost all sense of shame and repeatedly urged the Chinese government to officially recognize the import of opium. For example, Viscount Palmerston (HZ T Polmsrston) issued an instruction to the British representative in China in 1843, saying, "You must work hard to urge the Chinese government to recognize the agreement to import opium as a legal commodity." Because of such behavior, since the Treaty of Nanjing, British concessions have become open smuggling zones for opium. This situation has continued until recently, and this is a fact that we cannot overlook. Progressive intellectuals in China are all familiar with the fact that foreign concessions are extraterritorial regions for opium. Like Lin Zexu, they all witnessed with unbearable anger the phenomenon of ignorant Chinese people becoming "living corpses" through the gifts offered by the British. Therefore, to the best of their ability, they continue to fight against opium and, furthermore, against the foreign imperialism that supports opium. In this sense, the Opium War in a broad sense is still continuing.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned struggle of the Chinese intelligentsia is actually a struggle against foreign imperialism and also a struggle against those reactionary elements who collude with it to make the habit of opium smoking permanent in the country. In China, the sale of opium has become one of the important sources of wealth for warlords. Therefore, as soon as opium prohibition is mentioned, those reactionary elements will definitely oppose it from a financial point of view. In contrast, intellectuals will definitely advocate it from the position of preserving national strength. In terms of argument, the former's advocacy, which goes against the surging tide of national independence, is ultimately not the opponent of the latter. However, in terms of the implementation of opium suppression, the power of their financialism is far greater than that of the ideology of preserving national strength. Reactionary elements often break the anti-smoking decisions of progressive intellectuals through sabotage. Because of this reason, regardless of the National Government's declaration in 1934 to completely ban the manufacture and smoking of opium by 1940, until 1943, today, the prohibition of opium has not been fully realized anywhere in China. Needless to say, the major reason of the so-called Sino-Japanese Incident must of course be taken into consideration. However, even in the Sino-Japanese Incident, the Chinese intelligentsia's concern for opium prohibition is by no means weak. The Chongqing side knows this very well, so it uses the intellectuals' concern for opium as anti-Japanese propaganda. That is, they propagate that Japan is using opium to systematically destroy the health of the Chinese people. Moreover, the Chongqing side's doctrine and propaganda are often aided by Britain and the United States, and this fact is also worthy of attention. The English magazine "Asia," published in October of the 29th year of the Republic of China, made an exaggerated report on the situation of opium smoking in North China, saying: "In Beijing, there are 305 opium dens and 61 opium shops; in Tianjin, there are 195 opium dens and 39 opium shops; in Jinan, there are 140 opium dens and 28 opium shops; in Tangshan, there are 150 opium dens and 23 opium shops." Then, it drew such a malicious conclusion, saying: "Using opium to poison the promising young people of China is the truth of the new order in East Asia."</p>
<p>Here, what we should pay attention to is that the fact that they have the materials for this kind of instigation cannot be said to be completely nonexistent on our side. Not to mention North China, or the Nanshi of Shanghai, even in Nanjing, which has become the capital of the National Government, we still see the facilities of the so-called "drug rehabilitation centers" and "talking rooms." As for what the content is, I am afraid there is no need to elaborate. Needless to say, a drastic ban on opium smoking often leads to the death of addicts. Therefore, rather than a strict "prohibition" limited to a certain period, "rehabilitation" is more appropriate. I once heard directly from Count Goto Shinpei, the Governor-General of Taiwan, that he had succeeded in Taiwan by adopting a rehabilitation policy instead of a "prohibition" policy. If the Nanjing government adopts a rehabilitation policy based on this view, implements a registration system for opium addicts, and limits them to entering and leaving rehabilitation centers, so as to realize a strict "prohibition" plan within a certain period, then there is nothing to say. But what is the actual situation? If the so-called "drug rehabilitation centers" and "talking rooms" are freely accessible to everyone, and female receptionists are used to lure young people who are not yet addicted to opium, then this is not allowed from the viewpoint of preserving national strength. If this situation continues, even if it is not Lin Zexu, one cannot but worry about "the country becoming poorer and the people becoming weaker, and in a few decades... there will be no soldiers to use." If this is the case, then it is not only a problem for China, but also for Japan, which is engaged in an unprecedented war with Britain and the United States, that the country "has no soldiers to use."</p>
<p>Chairman Wang once said in the English version of his book "China's Problems and Their Solutions": "Although I do not overemphasize past facts, I would like to cite an example. The fall of Chengde was the direct result of Tang Yulin's troops not resisting. Regardless of the fact that these troops were well-equipped, they still did not resist, simply because they were addicted to opium. The result is not surprising, because no one would expect an army of opium addicts to be able to resist. People are forced to plant poppy fruits and are forced to smoke opium. Even if they want to resist, they have no necessary will and physical strength." (China's Problems and Their Solution by Wang Ching-Wei 1934 Page 155) After reading this passage, it can be seen that Chairman Wang had long known that opium had a terrible impact on national strength. Therefore, if the current situation of opium smoking in the peaceful areas is as described above, then Chairman Wang will definitely thoroughly investigate the actual situation in the near future and implement measures based on the principle of putting the preservation of national strength first.</p>
<p>The Nanjing government should realize the anti-smoking policy that Chongqing wants to do but cannot do. This is of great significance to the solution of the Sino-Japanese Incident. Today, the only shortcut to strengthening the Nanjing government is to first gain the support of the strong Chinese people for the government. And the only shortcut to gaining the support of the Chinese people is to convince the Chinese intelligentsia of the Nanjing government's policies. No matter how Britain and the United States propagate and Chongqing instigates, if the Nanjing government can realize the extermination of the last opium addict, stabilize the lives of the people in the peaceful areas, and reach the state of "not picking up lost items on the road," then even the Chinese intelligentsia, who have been nurtured by a tenacious anti-Japanese consciousness, will have to change their plans and support the Nanjing government in the face of such facts. Even if it cannot suddenly reach such an ideal state, if it steadily shows that it is sincerely implementing policies that can reach such a state, then even the Chinese intelligentsia under the rule of Chongqing will gradually participate in the peace movement. If the intellectuals who now support Chongqing do not support Chongqing, then the foundation of Chiang Kai-shek's regime will be fundamentally shaken, split on its own, and eventually collapse. This is what Chiang Kai-shek is most afraid of now. On the other hand, if the Chinese intelligentsia always supports Chiang Kai-shek, then even if Chiang Kai-shek is driven out of Chongqing and flees to Tibet, he will still continue to resist Japan. The current war against Chongqing is a war of force and also a war of morality. Because the morale of a long-term war is ultimately dominated by morality. Under the current situation, it is better for the Nanjing government to conquer the conscience of the Chongqing intellectuals with morality than to fight with Chongqing by force. In such a moral war, the opium problem is the best battlefield. In Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Guangdong, and other provinces under the rule of Chongqing, they have been famous opium producing areas since ancient times. Especially in Sichuan, the habit of opium smoking is the most deeply rooted. Chiang Kai-shek certainly adopts an anti-smoking policy, but the people's habit of opium smoking has not been eradicated after all. In contrast, in the peaceful areas, because they are far from the opium producing areas, the price of opium is very high. Therefore, if the Nanjing government can engage in the fight against opium with sincerity and devotion, then its extermination is definitely not difficult. The Nanjing government occupies far more "geographical advantages" than Chongqing in the war against opium.</p>
<p>Japan cannot but be deeply concerned about the current situation in which the human element, which is absolutely necessary for the completion of the Greater East Asia War, is being destroyed by opium. Therefore, the current opium problem in China must permanently abandon the position of financialism and be judged from the position of preserving the national strength of the Chinese nation. In wartime Tokyo and Osaka, if there were also the strange phenomena of "drug rehabilitation centers" and "talking rooms" that are seen in Nanjing and Shanghai today, how would the Japanese people feel about it? At this time, if they still think, "Chinese people are Chinese people, and Japanese people are Japanese people," then this is far from the idea of treating Chinese people as true comrades-in-arms in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>I advocate that in order to win the war against Britain and the United States, Japan must first win the conscience of the Chinese people, especially the conscience of the Chinese intelligentsia. Therefore, I believe that assisting the Nanjing government to quickly win over the Chinese intelligentsia to solve the opium problem is the first priority. If the fact that there are many opium dens in the resistance areas and not a single opium den in the peaceful areas is realized, then the Chinese intelligentsia will have nothing to say and will believe in Japan's sincerity!</p>
<p>However, the struggle against opium is not as easy as talking about it. Feudal reactionary elements often adhere to the position of financialism, and the gangsters in the opium dens will use the power of money to try to maintain their drug trafficking organizations that exploit the blood of the Chinese nation. However, the Chinese and Japanese intellectuals who do not want the Chinese nation to perish, no, who do not want the Asian nations to perish, will launch a common moral struggle against their opposition. The author firmly believes that only through such a common struggle can true Sino-Japanese total goodwill be produced. (Translated by Ding Licai)</p>

<h3>Oil Merchants Request Organizational Rectification to Alleviate Citizens' Panic Over Edible Oil, Military Allocation Authorities Revise Various Oil Prices</h3>
<p>Following the recent establishment of an industry association for edible oil merchants under orders, the Shanghai Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office, responsible for rationing matters in the city, has stated that its future work will continue as before. In addition to adhering to the intentions of the military allocation group in taking charge of procurement, transportation, and supply, it also plans to facilitate the supply of edible oil from Dalian, Qingdao, and other places to supplement the shortage of edible oil in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces.</p>
<p>Thirty-Seven Oil Merchants Appeal</p>
<p>Thirty-seven stores in the city that operate in the edible oil business, with the edible oil industry ordered to organize an industry association, are bound to have a plan for reform. Therefore, they place ardent expectations on the future, and especially appeal to the preparatory directors of the edible oil industry association, saying: "We merchants have been in the edible oil business for many years. In previous years, a few oil merchants, in order to seek a balance between production and sales, organized institutions such as the Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office. Since the establishment of this office, the citizens' panic over edible oil has not been alleviated in the slightest. Recently, the authorities of the National Government, in view of the past imperfections of the edible oil institutions, intend to make a thorough reorganization, and have appointed Chen Ziyi, Zhang Dalian, and Shen Weiya as the preparatory directors of the edible oil industry association, planning the reorganization matters. We merchants are very happy to hear about this. Zhang Dalian was the former chairman of the Sauce Industry Association, and Shen Weiya is the current director of the Sauce and Wine Industry Association. Chen Ziyi is expected to embrace a spirit of impartiality and selflessness, and seek the welfare of the entire industry. At this time of reform, the industry is eager to understand how the association will be organized and what its content will be. We deeply hope that the past accumulated malpractices can be swept away, that personal relationships can be broken, that we will never be impoverished by selfish thoughts, or be surrounded by villains, so as to live up to the importance of the national entrustment and the ardent expectations of the industry. Then, the citizens' panic over edible oil can be dispelled from now on. We earnestly hope that you will investigate this matter, and we also ask the public to jointly oversee it." The edible oil stores that have signed their names are Dafenglun, Shenghe, Hechang, Zhihe, Datong, Yuanhefeng, Songshengyi, Hengchangxin, Sanhe, Wuhe, Songchunhe, Hengfengtai, Daxingxiang, Yongda, Songchunxin, Kangyuan, Zhongyuan, Lao Wanshun, Weihe, Chen Wanfeng, Yutai Xin, Wanshen, Lianxin, Taiji, Wanyuanqiaji, Dingtaichang, Zhang Zhenyu, Wanli, Zhenkangchang, Taihexian, Wantai Xin, Dinghe, Yuchangchenji, Wandaxin, Shenshengchang, Hesheng, and Xiefeng.</p>
<h3>Revised Oil Prices</h3>
<p>It is reported that recently, the military allocation authorities, due to the high prices of oil bean production areas and the expensive cost of shipping to Shanghai, in order to facilitate procurement, specially ordered the Shanghai Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office yesterday to revise the prices of various edible oils. Soybean oil is now priced at 20.04 yuan per 覲 (jin), raw oil and sesame oil are priced at 21.42 yuan, and rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil are priced at 19.38 yuan, effective from today.</p>
<h3>Mayor Chen Returns to Shanghai After Completing Official Duties</h3>

Special Envoy Chen completed his visit to Japan and returned to China on the 14th of this month, and returned to Nanjing on the 18th to pay his respects to the Chairman and report on his visit to Japan. It is now learned that Special Envoy Chen returned to Shanghai from Nanjing at 7:15 yesterday morning, and after taking a car back to his residence for a short rest, he went to the city government to work.</p>

The municipal government has received instructions and forwarded them to all subordinates for compliance.</p>
<h3>Jing'an Baojia District Revises Self-Defense Corps Penalties</h3>
<p>The Jing'an Temple Baojia District Committee, in view of the fact that the Self-Defense Corps penalties were promulgated earlier, and fearing that they may be relaxed over time and delay important public affairs, has specially re-published them as follows: A. If a Self-Defense Corps member loses their armband for the first time, in addition to paying for it at the current price, they will be fined 100 yuan, and a receipt will be given. If they are unable to pay, they will be fined 10 posts. If they lose their armband for the second time, in addition to paying for it at the current price, they will be fined 500 yuan, and a receipt will be given.

<h3>Pan Da, Director of the West Shanghai Police Bureau, Restrains Police Officers, Arrests and Summons of Criminals Must Have Tickets and Certificates, Those Who Impersonate Will Be Severely Punished According to Law</h3>
<p>Pan Da, Director of the West Shanghai Police Bureau, has always been extremely restrained with police officers. He has now instructed all police officers, saying: The heads of all departments, teams, and branches must investigate and restrain their subordinates, and do not allow them to commit criminal offenses and tarnish the reputation of the police. He also issued a notice to the public in West Shanghai, saying: When this bureau arrests and summons criminals, it is stipulated that arrest warrants or summons must be filled out. If it is for search matters, a search warrant must be filled out, all of which are stamped with the official seal of this bureau and handed over to the investigating police officers for execution, in order to show solemnity and eliminate abuses. A special announcement is made to inform everyone that if anyone does not hold the above-mentioned tickets and certificates, impersonates the name of this bureau, swindles and deceives, or extorts by intimidation, they should be handed over to the police on duty, or directly report to the director of this bureau by telephone. They will be severely punished according to law, and will never be tolerated.</p>
<h3>No. 279 Tram Ticket Seller Robs Monthly Passes</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 25th) at around 10 o'clock, when the No. 20 trolleybus heading west arrived at Jing'an Temple, the passengers were very crowded. A Central News Agency staff member who had purchased a first-class monthly pass, because there were fewer passengers in the third-class carriage, boarded the third-class carriage. At this time, the No. 279 third-class ticket seller did not give tickets after receiving money. Many passengers dared to be angry but dared not speak out. Later, because the Central News Agency staff member had purchased a monthly pass, the attempt to freeload failed, and he spoke rudely and asked to see the monthly pass. After the monthly pass was shown, the ticket seller was so bold as to forcibly rob it. All the passengers were indignant. This kind of bad behavior is a matter of great concern to the citizens. Passengers often swallow their anger and dare not speak out. Therefore, it is hoped that the company authorities must first eradicate this kind of bad behavior, and it is hoped that the police authorities will give the citizens protection. The citizens will be able to cooperate closely with the company authorities to eliminate the bad habit of freeloading. It is heard that the Central News Agency has sent a letter to report to the company authorities and severely punish the No. 279 ticket seller.</p>
<h3>The Ninth Batch of Coal is Allocated to the Market, Limited to Ordinary Users, Not to be Resold for Factory Use</h3>
<p>For the ninth batch of coal allocated by the Dazhonglian Coal Company, Yangquan lump coal, Liuquan screened coal, and Shandong screened coal, totaling more than 4,000 tons, have been allocated to various coal retailers and are now being handled. The soft currency has also been collected by 28 coal companies, including Yitaixing, Huazhong, and Yuantai. It is now learned that the coal allotted to each retailer has been issued to the designated warehouse for delivery to the market with a delivery order, but it is limited to being sold to ordinary users such as families, bathrooms, boiled water industry, apartments, restaurants, and hotels. It must not be resold for factory use. It is strictly forbidden to raise prices for profit and hoard for speculation. Those who violate this will have their rights to allocated coal confiscated.</p>
<h3>Adding Water to Sugar: A Disguised Form of Cheating on Weight</h3>
<p>Following the city's implementation of sugar rationing under the supervision of the Municipal Food Bureau, the threat to sugar supply has eased. It has been found that the sugar sales in the Nanshi area are handled by the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Office, entrusted by the Food Bureau. However, many retail sugar merchants in the area failed to comply strictly. During the first sugar rationing period, incidents of exceeding the price limit and shortchanging customers on weight occurred repeatedly. After the bureau issued severe warnings, the second rationing period was conducted earnestly. Unexpectedly, a few retail sugar merchants, remaining unrepentant, resorted to adding water to the allocated sugar to increase the weight and cheat on the quantity. As a result, most of the sugar purchased by citizens was damp, drawing widespread complaints. Upon learning this, the Food Bureau is dispatching a large number of personnel to conduct a thorough investigation. It also hopes that citizens throughout the district will report any fraudulent sugar merchants to the Food Bureau to help eliminate malpractices and improve the sugar rationing system. The citizens of Nanshi also hope that the authorities will conduct a strict investigation and impose severe penalties without leniency.</p>
<h3>Elite Police Officers of the International Settlement to Hold Grand Review Today; Chinese, Japanese, Russian, and Indian Units to Be Inspected; Medals to Be Awarded for Over 20 Years of Service</h3>
<p>The Police Headquarters of the International Settlement originally planned to hold a grand review of the elite units from various district police stations and auxiliary agencies at the Racecourse at 2:00 PM on the 23rd. Due to rain on that day, it was temporarily rescheduled to 2:00 PM today (the 27th), still at the Racecourse. The Chairman of the Municipal Council, Katsuo Okazaki, will serve as the reviewing officer. The Commissioner General of Police, Tadashi Watari, along with Deputy Commissioner General Goshima and other senior officers, will also participate. Senior officers of the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai, relevant officers from the French Concession Police Department, consuls from various countries in Shanghai, and heads of Paochens (neighborhood associations) will be invited to observe. Invitations have been issued, and the Chinese police band will perform on site. The police officers to be inspected include Japanese, Chinese, Russian, and Indian units, as well as the management team of the Ward Road Gaol (Prison).

<h3>Shanghai West Property Tax: Old Arrears Must Be Paid by Deadline; Tax Rate to Be Revised This Year</h3>
<p>The Shanghai West Office of the Municipal Finance Bureau has reported that many property tax arrears from 1942 in the district remain unpaid. The matter has been submitted to the Shanghai West Finance Advisory Committee, which has resolved to set a deadline for the collection of these arrears. The measures are as follows: (1) The 1942 property tax will be collected at 30%. (2) The spring 1942 property tax will be converted from old currency to new currency at a ratio of two to one. (3) The summer tax and subsequent taxes will be collected in new currency at face value. Furthermore, starting this spring, the tax rate has been revised to 40%, which has been approved by the Shanghai West Finance Bureau's Advisory Committee and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval.</p>
<h3>Tram Company Determined to Eradicate "Skimming"; Passenger Crowds Increase but Revenue Decreases; Those in Charge Express Regret</h3>
<p>To prevent ticket conductors from engaging in fraud, the Tram Company of the International Settlement, in addition to strictly ordering ticket inspectors to earnestly perform their duties, has recently dispatched several plainclothes inspectors posing as passengers to conduct covert investigations. It is reported that the tram company intends to impose stricter penalties on those found to be engaging in fraud, as the recent "skimming" has become rampant. Since the beginning of this year, the tram company has observed that passenger volume has been consistently high, but the daily revenue has been lower than before, which the company finds extremely regrettable. In addition to dismissing some of those engaged in fraud, the company is urging the public to report any misconduct for investigation.</p>
<h3>May: Full Month on Alert; All Assemblies and Parades Prohibited</h3>
<p>The police authorities of both concessions, the Municipal Police, and the Shanghai West Police Bureau, in view of the numerous holidays in May, fear that unscrupulous elements may attempt to take the opportunity to instigate riots and disrupt public order. To prevent such incidents from occurring, they have stipulated that special security measures will be implemented throughout the city from April 30th to June 1st to maintain order and ensure safety. It is reported that during this period of special security, all assemblies and parades are prohibited without special permission from the police authorities, and violators will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Free Inoculation Centers Established by Various Paochen (Neighborhood Association) Organizations</h3>

Users who have received a notification from the committee regarding such accounts should proceed to the New Enemy Property Management Committee at 27 Beijing Road before April 30th to complete the necessary application procedures. Those who have not received such notification but are using telephone accounts under the names of enemy nationals should also voluntarily apply for registration. Otherwise, they risk having their telephone service revoked.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Distribution by the Consignment Association in Three Batches; Price Controls Implemented and Refusal to Sell Strictly Prohibited; Wholesale and Retail Merchants Must Display Wooden Signs</h3>
<p>The Hua Zhong Tobacco Consignment Association has notified wholesale and retail merchants that the third batch of cigarette distribution will be based on the A, B, C, and D grade system. Payment is required before merchants can clear their goods. The association is actively expediting the procedures for goods delivery. Wholesale merchants are expected to begin taking delivery of goods today, with completion expected before the end of the month. Retail merchants must begin taking delivery of goods by May 1st. To thoroughly eliminate the black market for cigarettes and strictly enforce price controls, the association has dispatched a large number of inspectors in groups to oversee the operations of cigarette distributors. They must strictly supervise the business of each cigarette sales outlet in accordance with the "Regulations for Guiding and Supervising Tobacco Sales" and the "Instructions for Tobacco Retailers." The previously issued wooden signs for wholesale and retail merchants must be displayed in a conspicuous place. Instruction record books will also be issued to record the instructions of the inspectors. Hoarding and refusal to sell are prohibited by law, and violators will be subject to penalties such as suspension of distribution, depending on the severity of the offense.</p>
<h3>Paochen Youth Division: Mandarin Competition</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Youth Division of the International Settlement Paochen has spared no effort in promoting its work. An increasing number of youths from all walks of life are participating. In addition to providing comprehensive training in both physical and intellectual education, the division also invites experts to give lectures to cultivate the healthy thinking of young people. To train the language skills of young people, the division held a Mandarin speech competition yesterday afternoon on the third floor of the YMCA on Jing'an Temple Road. Participating members were divided into seven districts, with two representatives from each district. They spoke on the topic of "How to Be a Modern Youth," giving full play to their ideas. Their performance in terms of thinking, pronunciation, attitude, and tone was all above average. The results of the judging were: first place went to Mr. Pan Zhensheng from the Xinzha district, second place to Mr. Jin Wanwei from the Chengdu district, and third place to Mr. Zai Fuchang from the Xinzha district. The first-place team was the Xinzha district. The Minister of the division, Peng Sijian, awarded prizes and adjourned the meeting.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Field Tax Collection Office Relocates Sub-Collection Office</h3>
<p>The Shanghai West Field Tax Collection Office, which began collecting field taxes for the Shanghai West, Nanshi, and Special District areas this month, has established four sub-collection offices to facilitate payment for the public. The original site of the Putuo district sub-collection office was at the Dakin Primary School on Hopeh Road, but because the area is not central to the district, it has now been moved to the Huacao Township Office. The original site of the French Concession district office at Zhoujiaqiao Township Office has been moved to the head office of the Shanghai West Field Tax Collection Office, located at 4, Lane 92, Jessfield Road. If you have any questions regarding field taxes, you can inquire at the head office.</p>
<h3>Southern Painters Establish China Light Painting and Calligraphy Association</h3>

<h3>Current Difficulties of Consumer Cooperatives – A Discussion of the Experiences of Running This Newspaper’s Cooperative for Seven Months</h3>
<p>— Yu Qingren</p>
<p>The consumer cooperative of this newspaper's colleagues, which had been brewing for over a year, was formally established at the beginning of September of last year. It is only a seven-month-old infant now. Naturally, it should not presumptuously discuss its experiences in front of the veterans with a long history and rich experiences. However, as a member of the nurturing team of this cooperative, I have been watching it struggle to grow up in an environment that is not conducive to its survival, learning to walk clumsily, and bumping its head into many bruises. I cannot help but feel moved by the scene and want to express my naive experiences. As for being ridiculed by experts, I cannot care about that.</p>
<p>1. The Contradiction Between Theory and Practice: When mentioning consumer cooperatives, one will immediately think of its basic theory - that is, consumers combine with each other to purchase goods directly from producers, avoiding the exploitation of intermediaries, thereby reducing the burden on consumers. However, in this turbulent market, there is a widespread shortage of materials. Manufacturers sometimes have goods without prices, sometimes their wholesale prices are higher than market prices, and sometimes they do not even offer wholesale prices, leaving you helpless and having to temporarily shelve this valuable theory. For example, when this cooperative was first established, it wanted to purchase one or two kinds of ordinary toothpaste. The author personally went to a well-known toothpaste manufacturer to negotiate. At that time, their wholesale price was 550 yuan per gross, which was almost 4 yuan per tube. They frankly advised us to purchase from wholesalers, as it would be much cheaper. They even introduced us to several wholesalers. Finally, they sincerely said, "In this chaotic market, running a consumer cooperative is bound to encounter setbacks." Later, the author inquired and found that the wholesale price of this toothpaste was only 260-270 yuan per gross, which was 1.8-1.9 yuan per tube. However, if you look at the newspapers at that time, you will see many department stores attracting business with cheap prices of 1 yuan or even 5 jiao per tube. Under such circumstances, the author had to temporarily abandon the attempt to purchase toothpaste. Recently, the wholesale price of this toothpaste has risen to about 680 yuan per gross, which is 5.6-5.7 yuan per tube. When the author saw that the manufacturer was advertising a price limit of 3.85 yuan per tube, I was naturally overjoyed and immediately sent someone to negotiate. To my surprise, the reply was "out of stock." Not only toothpaste but also other daily necessities often experience similar situations. A month ago, to purchase socks, the author contacted several manufacturers one after another, but they were either "out of stock" or "had not yet announced the wholesale price." All of this could not help but make the author constantly recall the advice of the gentleman from the toothpaste factory, causing me to sigh deeply.</p>
<p>2. The Inversion of Wholesale and Retail Prices: Since directly purchasing goods from manufacturers has encountered setbacks, we can only temporarily abandon theory, compromise with reality, and purchase from the black market. Purchasing wholesale is always cheaper than retail. This is common experience. The consumer cooperative might as well take a step back and find a way out from here. Unexpectedly, when prices rise, because hoarders drag in goods in large quantities, wholesale prices are particularly high. However, because the retail prices of stores are subject to stricter restrictions, they cannot be increased at any time, so they are relatively cheaper. In mid-February, this cooperative wanted to purchase towels. At that time, the wholesale price of 23 taels of bleached white towels was about 85 yuan per dozen, but the retail price at the Sanyou Industrial Cooperative was only 72 yuan per dozen. When the wholesale price of 32-count dog-head brand socks rose to 200 yuan per dozen, the retail price was still only 16-17 yuan. The toothpaste mentioned above is also an example. The inversion of retail and wholesale prices cannot be believed by those who have not experienced it personally. In such a market, where can the consumer cooperative find a way out?</p>
<p>3. Most Distribution Turns Eludes the Cooperative: Since the consumer cooperative is encountering setbacks everywhere, why not request distribution from the allocation agencies? Isn't this a broad road? Yes, several kinds of daily necessities can be obtained through distribution. This cooperative has successively obtained matches, soap, sugar, and cooking oil through distribution. The supply of matches and sugar is sufficient for distribution. The cooking oil is allocated to the economic canteen of this cooperative and is barely enough. This should be appreciated. As for soap, only one box of Guben soap has been distributed in the past six months, which is truly a drop in the bucket. In addition, most allocation agencies probably still feel unfamiliar with the organization of consumer cooperatives and are unwilling to acknowledge that it is also a commercial institution that can be treated equally with ordinary stores. Therefore, they ignore it and do not respond to its requests. For example, this cooperative and the News Newspaper Colleagues' Consumer Cooperative jointly requested cigarette distribution. According to the procedures, we filled out an application, presumably because they believed that we were not members of the tobacco industry and did not qualify. Therefore, after the application was sent, it was like a stone sinking into the sea, with no news at all. In fact, using consumer cooperatives to implement distribution can allow commodities to reach consumers' hands directly and will never lead to the trickery of ordinary stores, which makes consumers suffer from the lack of goods even with money.</p>
<p>4. Adapting to Environmental Changes: The emergence of each system has its environment at that time. When the environment changes, the system that adapts to the environment will naturally be revised. In the current special environment, in order to reduce the burden on consumers, the consumer cooperative may as well make a small turn to avoid encountering setbacks everywhere. When prices are rising, the goods purchased today are indeed not cheaper than retail prices at that time. However, after a month or two, the retail price will rise. Then, wouldn't the items that were purchased earlier become cheaper goods? Therefore, in order to avoid the pressure of rising prices, the consumer cooperative itself must store more goods. Storing goods for consumption should of course not be regarded as hoarding. In desperation, this cooperative has adopted this turning method. However, adopting this method naturally requires a considerable amount of capital. This cooperative still feels financially strained at times, even with the newspaper as its backing. If it is an ordinary consumer combination without a backing with considerable financial strength, it would be difficult to manage. Moreover, adopting this method involves the risk of losing money when prices plummet.</p>
<p>5. Amateur Business Experience: Raising a newborn child is indeed not an easy task. At first, it is difficult to grasp his temperament and accurately determine his needs. As he gradually grows, his range of needs expands day by day. In order to meet his needs, the nanny must inquire about this market situation today and compare that type of goods tomorrow. Therefore, an amateur nanny has also learned many business skills. For example, the cost of things like towels and socks should be calculated. Therefore, when estimating prices, you know that towels should be weighed, distinguished by color, and look at the terry loop. Socks should be weighed, distinguished by count, and look at the luster. As for distinguishing the quality of soap, you even have to lick it with the tip of your tongue, which is simply an unbelievable method to outsiders. However, amateur business is particularly difficult, especially in today's environment where prices fluctuate so sharply. You can't help but be worried all the time, fearing that you will lose money. As for how much appetite there is for a certain commodity, it is even more difficult to grasp for those who have no experience. Sometimes, I fear that too many goods will be purchased and that sales will be slow. Other times, I fear that the supply will be too small. As a gentleman suggested, in order to purchase cooking oil, this cooperative also contacted. However, after the contact was finalized, the seller refused to sell because the market price rose. In another case, we obtained the distribution of 10 dan of edible salt. I was deeply afraid that buyers would not be enthusiastic. Because the time was delayed too long, I was afraid that the edible salt would be exposed, so I had to sell it together with sugar. Unexpectedly, it was sold out in a short time, and those who came later regretted it.</p>
<p>After talking a lot of rambling words, veterans may think that these are all immature experiences and are not worth mentioning. Fortunately, the colleagues of the News Newspaper Consumer Cooperative held a symposium and will unite with each other to organize an association. Then I am not alone. We will research and discuss together in the future, and perhaps we can come up with a steady plan to make our consumer cooperative have a solid foundation, so that investors feel reliable. This is the responsibility of colleagues and is always what we strive to do.</p>
<h3>Economic Circles: Commentary: A Matter Worth Learning From</h3>
<p>"A mirror is indispensable." If you don't have one yourself, you can borrow one. That's why it's called "borrowing a mirror." We believe that the Municipal Council's Material Control Department's dismissal of ten investigators and the public disclosure of the names and photographs of the dismissed individuals in Chinese and foreign newspapers is something that general economic control agencies can learn from.</p>
<p>Although the reasons for the dismissal of the ten investigators of the Municipal Council's Material Control Department were not explicitly announced, it is believed that such a disclosure method, at least, is intended to make the public pay attention to the full names and true colors of the dismissed individuals. The intention is, of course, very profound and thought-provoking.</p>
<p>Originally, personnel issues are the most important, complex, and difficult issues in economic control organizations. As the saying goes, "With a large number of people, it is inevitable that there will be both virtuous and unscrupulous individuals." The most effective method of restraint is "If there are verifiable facts, they should be directly exposed and made public to society for sanctions." We are only afraid that despite the verifiable facts, due to personal relationships or fear of power, they will not hesitate to "hide dirt and harbor filth" and let the matter rest. This is what general economic control agencies, especially autonomous economic control agencies, must be most vigilant and cautious about. Because a sacred and supreme principle in the control system is that one must not use the opportunity of control, nor can one use the power of control, to put it another way, one must not regard "control" as a "way to make money." Public opinion is to be feared. Therefore, the authorities in charge of control must pay the closest attention to the personnel participating in the control work.</p>
<h3>Various Associations and Federations to Be Established by the End of May</h3>
<p>In order to implement the wartime economic policy guidelines and strengthen the autonomous control of commercial organizations, the National Government, with the approval of the Supreme National Defense Council, has established the National Commercial Control General Association and promulgated the Provisional Regulations for the Movement Control of Wartime Materials. These measures are being implemented step by step to control work. At the same time, the National Government has established a Materials Control Review Committee to supervise the National Commercial Control General Association to improve its operational functions. Therefore, in order to adapt to the wartime economic system, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has promulgated the Provisional Regulations for Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations, engaging in adjusting the organizational economic structure of industrial and commercial groups, so that they can serve as the industry control organizations under the National Commercial Control General Association, uniformly purchasing and distributing matters.</p>
<p>Regarding the current supervisory organizations of various trade associations, industry federations, and Sino-Japanese joint venture industry federations, according to a Central News Agency reporter's inquiry: (1) Regarding the Sino-Japanese joint venture industry federations, the Materials Control Review Committee has held a meeting of executive directors and decided to first establish nine industries, including miscellaneous grains, flour milling, livestock, sugar, cotton, tobacco leaf, candle, match, and soap, and has appointed influential figures from both Chinese and Japanese industry to be the directors of preparation. (2) Regarding the joint federations of major commodity trade associations in Shanghai and Nanjing, the two special municipalities in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has established a Committee for the Reorganization of Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations, designating the organizers of sixteen types of trade association federations to organize them. (The names of the sixteen types of trade association federations have been recorded in previous newspapers.) The above two parts of the industrial and commercial trade association federations are all institutions under the professional departments of the Commercial Control Association, and all participate as members. (3) Regarding the adjustment and organization of industrial and commercial trade associations in this city, the Municipal Bureau of Economy will supervise and urge them to reorganize in accordance with the regulations. All old associations that were previously unsuitable for the wartime system will be suspended, and the bureau will first designate the organizers of major commodity commercial associations to complete the organization within a specified period. It is heard that all the above associations and federations will be established by the end of May at the latest.</p>
<h3>Re-registration of Trade Association Members</h3>
<p>In accordance with the provisions of the Provisional Regulations for the Organization of Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations, the various industry associations in this city must submit detailed membership lists to the competent authorities. At the same time, the money trade association must also have membership lists of various industries in order to review legitimate commercial firms in various industries and provide them with financial transactions. Illegitimate commercial firms will be refused transactions in order to prevent speculators from using loans for hoarding and speculative trading. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has been asked to obtain membership lists from various industry associations for verification purposes. Therefore, the various industry associations are starting to re-register members, distributing forms and setting a deadline for filling them out. The forms include information such as the name of the branch, the number of employees, the representative, the amount of capital, and the resume of the representative, all of which must be truthfully reported.</p>
<h3>New Loan Methods Specified by Money Trade Association; Internal Market Price for the Fourth Quarter Set at Eight Yuan</h3>
<p>In view of the approaching end of the fourth quarter, the Money Trade Association held a meeting of the internal market on the afternoon of yesterday at 2:00 PM at its location on Ningbo Road. All members of the committee and representatives from various banks, including Yan Dayou, Xian Mengzhou, Xu Wenqing, and Shen Jingyi, were present. The meeting was chaired by Lu Shuchen, who reported on the issue of long-term credit loans and requested a public decision on the internal market price. The banks decided to handle credit loans in accordance with the "New Loan Methods for Money Trade" passed by the joint meeting of money trade associations. At the same time, it was resolved that the internal market price would be eight yuan, and the association would notify members of various banks to comply. The meeting adjourned at around 3:00 PM. It was also learned that item Ding of the new loan methods stipulates that "credit loans are limited to companies and firms, and the amount should be carefully considered and its use restricted." All old loans that do not conform to the above new regulations and violate the loan restriction measures promulgated by the Ministry of Finance should be recovered when they expire.</p>
<h3>Economic Bureau Cracks Down on Hoarding, Encourages Citizens to Report Violations</h3>
<p>After its establishment, the Municipal Bureau of Economy, in order to actively stabilize people's livelihoods and suppress commodity prices, encourages citizens to report private hoarding of goods in order to prevent unscrupulous merchants from hoarding and speculating, so as not to stimulate rising commodity prices. It is learned that the bureau has specifically consulted the police bureau for assistance. After receiving the letter, the Municipal Police Headquarters immediately ordered its subordinate branches to report violations at any time within their respective jurisdictions. Once discovered, rewards will be given in accordance with regulations, so that hoarding can be suppressed and the prices of daily necessities can be stabilized.</p>
<h3>Egg Trade Association Established Today</h3>
<p>The Municipal Egg Trade Association was ordered by the Ministry of Food to appoint Zheng Yuanxing and others to prepare for its establishment and was limited to establishing it within this month. Preparations are now complete, and the inaugural meeting is scheduled to be held at 2:00 PM this afternoon (the 27th) in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on Tianhouguan Bridge. The membership nature of the association includes (1) egg merchants with procurement capabilities, (2) those with egg shop facilities and retail capabilities, (3) egg merchants with egg factory facilities, and (4) egg exporters. When attending the meeting today, each store must send one representative to the meeting, and must bring a proof document signed and sealed by the person in charge of the store.</p>
<h3>New Hangzhou Tea on the Market</h3>
<p>Hangzhou has always been known as a tea-producing area. This year, the rainfall has been moderate and the output is abundant. Recently, various tea shops have been busy stocking up, and the atmosphere is very lively. However, the price of tea this year is higher than in the past. Recently, the market prices of various goods are as follows: Zheng Hao of Shifeng is priced at 250 yuan per catty when dry, Fu Hao is 200 yuan; Longjing from this mountain is the same at 360 yuan, Zheng Hao of Meiwu is the same at 320 yuan, Fu Hao is the same at 220 yuan; Zheng Lu Longjing from the four villages is 108 yuan per catty when wet, Zheng Lu of Fuyang is the same at 100 yuan, and miscellaneous market goods are the same at 80 to 90 yuan. Chaobu Longjing Qihong is the same at 100 yuan. When the new tea was first reported a few days ago, the market prices of various goods still had to be increased by dozens of yuan, and tea leaves originally belonged to fresh goods. Later, as more goods are shipped out, the price will be lowered day by day as usual.</p>
<h3>Readers' Forum: The New Stage of Shanghai Industry and Commerce and Its Current Urgent Tasks</h3>
<p>— Yi Ren</p>
<p>In the past, China was a semi-colonial country. The Anglo-American imperialists imposed countless shackles on China. They used force to create various privileges, on the one hand, treating China as a market for capital export, and on the other hand, treating it as a market for commodity export; at the same time, on the other hand, they purchased China's extremely cheap labor, seized China's material raw materials, and also used their privileges in tariffs. Imagine how China's semi-colonial and immature industry and commerce could compete with the advantageous economic forces of Anglo-American imperialists using various privileges? China's national industry was suppressed and could not breathe, and it has never been able to raise its head. As a result, China's national economy has become increasingly weak, rural areas have gone bankrupt, industry and commerce have been depressed, and China's economy has been in a slump!</p>
<p>Looking back at the past, the position of China's industry, commerce, and banking industry as vassals or maids of Anglo-American imperialists can be imagined! Even the so-called dignified national banks, such as the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, were only compradores and agents for Anglo-American imperialists to handle loans, remittances, and purchase Chinese raw materials!</p>
<p>However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and the National Government's declaration of war, China's economic future has also shown a glimmer of new dawn.</p>
<p>The facts are unfolding before our eyes. For example, the arrogant and dominant economic position of Anglo-American imperialists in the past has been completely lost, and it has been replaced by China's emerging national industry. On the other hand, the Japanese government, based on its moral policy, transferred the enemy's factories and properties to the National Government for operation and management; in addition, new decisions and implementations such as easing restrictions on the movement of materials have become a completely new and equal activity condition for China's economy. It goes without saying that this is of great significance and is a new and epoch-making stage in the history of China's economic development.</p>
<p>Therefore, China has now obtained very favorable and superior conditions and opportunities to develop the national economy. Chairman Wang said in the New National Movement Guidelines: "Why can't we implement the Principle of People's Livelihood? Because we have neglected the development of national capital. If we can focus on this point, then national capital will be developed, and private capital will naturally be subject to restraint." It can be seen that in order to improve and develop the economic life of the people, we must first develop national capital, and do not absolutely limit private capital. This is the prerequisite for developing China's national economy, and this is an economic policy that conforms to China's national conditions and the Principle of People's Livelihood. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>China's Currency Problem (I)</h3>
<p>— Written by Tadao Imamura</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>We often hear people say: "The currency problem is the most difficult, especially China's currency problem is unclear, and there are many things that are not easy to understand in the currency theory we have learned." Or say: "With the change of the times, the old currency theory is no longer universal, and new currency principles are needed. Especially in China, a Chinese currency theory is needed." Indeed, China's currency problem is often difficult for Japanese people who cannot fully understand Chinese society and politics, or a part of their habitual psychology. China's monetary phenomenon: There is a gap between the currency theory that Japanese people have always learned, and therefore there are often various wrong views. We must know that currency principles will never vary from time to time.</p>
<p>Although human social life may have some differences from time to time, the distance is never as far as the sky. China is also a part of the East Asian economy, and it has the same economic and social life as Japan. Under the same financial institutions, its currency principles will not be much different in essence. The only change that people feel is the change or difference in the premise of the principle's application: the principle is still the principle, and under the same premise conditions, it is equally applicable in China and Japan. However, in China, its premise conditions are different, so it is not easy to understand when it is considered suitable on the premise conditions of the principle difference. Therefore, it is considered that the difficulty of China's currency problem lies here, that what we have learned is without principles, or that there has been a change in China's currency problem.</p>
<p>Therefore, when studying China's currency problem, as long as we clearly recognize the difference in its premise conditions, we will not feel it is too difficult to understand, or particularly different. If we want to clearly recognize the difference in its premise conditions, we must not only study the currency problem, but also understand all economic conditions before we can discuss countermeasures.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Last spring, when the value of the old legal tender plummeted, Japanese Professor ○○ once asked Chinese financial figures this question: "What do you use paper money for after all? I cannot understand your concept of currency?" This question actually made them busy, so Japanese people generally believed that Chinese people's concept of paper money could not be understood, and they also felt that their psychological trust was strange. The Japanese thought is this: Since currency is issued and managed by the country, then one should have the same trust in the currency as in the country, and after the currency has obtained this credit, it will naturally be smooth. However, although China does not have such trust in the government that issues and manages currency, China's currency still maintains its value and circulation as usual. Looking at the old legal tender after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, although it was completely isolated from the government and issuing bank that managed this currency, it still circulated as usual. In this state of China, the trust in the government and the credit of the currency are completely separated, and no matter what the situation of the issuer and manager is, the currency still circulates as usual. It is no wonder that this point cannot be understood by general economic theory.</p>
<p>Moreover, Japanese people regard currency as treasure, and have a mysterious trust in currency. However, Chinese people do not regard paper money as treasure, and even less have a mysterious trust. Japanese people have the concept of treasure, so everyone wants to save, and they also cherish paper money very much. Although Chinese people love money more than life, they have a very weak concept of saving paper money, and they do not attach importance to paper money. From the Japanese point of view, this is also incredible and difficult to understand, but when thinking about the difference in the premise conditions of China, it is easy to understand and will not feel particularly strange. According to China, before the currency system was reformed, because the monetary policy was separated, and the people could not thoroughly understand the concept of the separation of the monetary policy, they only knew the concept of hard currency, and they often regarded hard currency as treasures. They did not know that paper money and hard currency were the same, and they did not even consider that paper money represents hard currency. The simple prejudice believes that paper money is only a means of circulation. Standing on this simple position, they received paper money and used it to purchase real objects, so paper money really became the effect of "paper money."</p>
<p>In other words, China's political power has always been weak, so circulation is mostly on a social basis. Currency is considered to be only a means of circulation, so the ratio of political basis contained in the currency fluctuation factors is lower than in other occasions. There is a different feeling between the trust in politics and the credit of the currency itself. Because currency is considered to be only a means of social circulation, it is certainly not often regarded as treasure, so where would there be mysterious credit? Therefore, the trust in politics is low, and currency is not regarded as treasure, and there is no mysterious trust, but this cannot be used to conclude that Chinese people's trust in currency is low. According to the Japanese point of view, it is considered low, but from the Chinese point of view, they feel that there is already sufficient trust. At one time, Chinese financial figures and the trust in currency were discussed. A certain Japanese person asked this question: "Chinese people's trust in paper money is very low." However, the Chinese replied: "The credit of currency now is definitely not low, it should be said to be good." This difference in opinion is due to the different basic conditions in the concept. Chinese people regard currency as a means of circulation, so as long as currency has the function of circulation, it can be said that the credit of paper money is good.</p>

<h3>"The Heart of Compassion"</h3>
<p>— Zhen Diaoge</p>
<p>We Chinese people have always spared no effort in preserving and developing the teachings of the "early sages and wise men"; like what "Asia Saint - Mencius told us, 'Without a heart of compassion, one is not human,' all 'people' are 'spread over the four bodies and manifested in their movements'."</p>
<p>"The heart of compassion" is a Confucian saying, which in Buddhism is "the heart of compassion", and in us ordinary people is "sympathy".</p>
<p>For example, a drug-addicted beggar asks you for money. Although you know that the reason why he is a beggar must be because he did not study hard in the past, and even now, he still does not study hard; but when you hear his sad voice and humble attitude, you cannot help but give him money. However, when you see a great traitor being beheaded, or a rebellious son who killed his father being tattooed and executed, even though he has not robbed you of anything, and even though you are not his father, you will never sigh and say: "These officials, these executioners, really have no 'heart of compassion'!" On the contrary, you will shout "Good! Good!"</p>
<p>Why can both cause people to feel "compassion" but with different results? This is because the former gives you less disgust than "compassion", and the latter gives you more disgust than "compassion"; the former does not cause great harm to society, while the latter is the scourge of society.</p>
<p>Therefore, the object of giving "a heart of compassion" is conditional: some can be given, and some simply cannot be given, like great traitors, rebellious sons, and hoarders. For them, only impartial handling is appropriate!</p>
<h3>Watching the Performance of "Canary"</h3>
<p>— Mei Yu</p>
<p>"China Travel" has made a comeback and is staging "Canary" at the Lihua Theater. This is a story about chorus girls.</p>
<p>Zhou Yibai's plays have always been highly respected by people. "Canary" is his new work, which fully demonstrates the achievements of tragicomedy. Comparatively speaking, the comedic elements occupy the majority.</p>
<p>In the performance, Luo Lan is the one who has the most satisfactory results. She can act according to the character of the person in the play. In the first act, she plays the flattering expression of a corpulent merchant, which is so realistic that she can be compared with Tang Ruoqing's Chen Bailu in "Sunrise".</p>
<p>The fluency and clarity of the Mandarin, and the natural attitude are all points of Luo Lan's success. I believe that her future achievements are limitless.</p>
<p>The corpulent merchant Zhao Guoyuan is played by Li Jingbo. His acting skills are superb, and his expressions are profound and moving. Moreover, he is also the director of the play, and he also has ideal success. He can handle the whole play very lightly and lively, and he can make people laugh everywhere.</p>
<p>Lan Qing's crazy and pretentious acting is also commendable. Chen Yulin's clever expression is also one of the successful people in the play. Lin Na's role as Hong Yulan is also very good at grasping the personality.</p>
<p>The most amusing thing is the third act, where Long Gushi makes a scene at Zhao Guoyuan's house, almost making the audience laugh with a warm and satisfying sound all the time.</p>
<p>The relatively lacking part is the actor who plays Long Debiao, perhaps because of experience! In terms of expression and Mandarin, he is weaker than other roles.</p>
<p>Tang Qi's troupe master is full of expressions of the play everywhere, and he can grab the audience's attention.</p>
<p>To sum up, the performers of the whole play are very hardworking. Among the plays performed in front of them, it is a play worth watching, and this kind of typical play is very suitable for the audience's appetite, because it is very suitable for the conditions of comedy.</p>
<h3>Yangchun Small Collection</h3>
<p>— Jiang Feng</p>
<p>Cultivation can be divided into two categories: "positive" and "negative". The former can enable us to understand society, understand ourselves, temper our character, increase our knowledge, and cultivate the courage to fight for life, and encourage us to move forward on the road of life. The latter can only make us negative, make us muddled, teach us to avoid reality, and think "take a step back" in everything... Not looking forward but looking back, or just stagnating in the status quo, not thinking about improvement, and not wanting to make progress.</p>
<p>The cultivation we need is "positive"; not "negative"!</p>
<p>Satisfaction cannot eliminate "worries"; on the contrary, sometimes it can prolong "worries" and increase "worries". If no one had invented electric lights, telephones, ships, and airplanes because of dissatisfaction with the current situation... wouldn't we still be "worried" about various inconveniences now?</p>
<p>Only those who have a clear understanding of reality, a correct grasp of the meaning of life, and a bright ideal for the future can not be depressed by temporary hardships and dissatisfaction, and can never be bound by the poisonous snake of "worry"!</p>
<p>The spirit of fearlessness must be matched with correct vision and firm will in order to achieve something. Otherwise, it is just the courage of a mere person, and there is no value.</p>
<p>If historical figures such as Stephenson and Edison did not have the correct vision and judgment, and only relied on the spirit of fearlessness to blindly break through, then their ideals would be similar to "trying to take off into the air by grabbing their hair", and even if they worked hard, they would never have any hope of realization. Similarly, without a firm will and inability to persevere, then all previous efforts will be abandoned and all efforts will be in vain.</p>
<h3>Talented Man and Beautiful Woman</h3>
<p>— Yale</p>
<p>In a wedding ceremony, the officiant or the guests' speeches are mostly inseparable from flattering words such as "talented man and beautiful woman". This is really "catering to their preferences" for the parties involved, and the guests who watch the ceremony cannot help but feel envious.</p>
<p>"A woman adorns herself for the one who pleases her" is enough to believe that those who can be pleased must seek the beauty of their appearance: and the so-called ideal son-in-law "selected from the screen" must also value talent above all else. No wonder the deeds of "talented scholars and beautiful women" in old novels are enthusiastically talked about by many men and women, and even they themselves seem to have the air of "talented scholars" and "beautiful women". Is this probably one of the desires that people seek?</p>
<p>Although the current marriage methods and the ideals of men and women in choosing partners are very different from the past, the ostentatious and strong concept of "talented man and beautiful woman" is still deeply rooted in people's hearts. It seems that only in this way can it be considered "a good match", so the "Qin and Jin" of men with talents and women with beauty cannot but be admired.</p>
<p>In fact, there are still many marriage-style transactions. Men can ignore their "talents" and only seek their "wealth", while women must have a "flower-like and jade-like" beauty. Therefore, in some occasions, praising them as "talented man and beautiful woman" is more of a satire than a compliment, and it contains a meaning of contempt for women.</p>
<p>Because they can rely on money and power to buy young girls, there are few with "talents" and many with beautiful "appearances". But youth is easy to pass, how can we forever maintain our youthful appearance, so there are more problems!</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that men must have some talent, and women should not only have the beautiful "outward appearance", but also have the virtuous wisdom of the "inner beauty".</p>
<h3>Nanny! A New Profession for Women</h3>
<p>— Yi Qun</p>
<p>Recently, I often see advertisements for nannies, which symbolizes the society's need for nannies. Childcare is indeed the biggest concern of mothers. When women are striving for economic independence, childcare is the most difficult problem to solve; it is certainly uneasy to entrust it to ignorant maids, and it feels that personal time and energy are too small to manage it personally, and yet there are no lack of people in society who hold up the banner of "children need education" and sing the tune of "women go back home to take care of their children", and in fact, there are many promising women who are trapped at home by their children and at a loss. In fact, it is not a perfect thing for children to grow up in the family. Ignorant women certainly cannot teach good children, and even if they grow up under the wings of "good mothers", they have already lost a lot in terms of the development of "group character". Children who are naturally fond of groups, because they live in a small circle from a young age, gradually develop a lonely and shy temper, which greatly affects their social life and becomes a lifelong regret. Therefore, people who are engaged in childcare work in modern times all set up kindergartens, nurseries, and other institutions one after another, hoping to reduce the suffering of women and develop the instincts of children. Some people in Shanghai have also paid attention to this recently, but the large number of nannies needed in nurseries and kindergartens must be trained and have considerable knowledge to be competent. Ordinary maids are completely unqualified. On the other hand, private families are also gradually feeling the importance of childcare and often seek nannies with knowledge. In order to adapt to the needs of society, the Shanghai YWCA has established a nanny training class. In the past five years, it has trained many childcare talents, laying a new foundation for the future childcare industry, and at the same time, it has met the aspirations of some families; on the other hand, it has also opened up a path for women who have a strong interest in children and have new confidence in the childcare industry. The implementation of this matter is worth promoting, and I hope that women can participate in and develop this work.</p>
<p>It is also heard that the 6th training class for nannies of the YWCA is now open for enrollment. There are three months of study and three months of internship. Women who are interested in childcare work can directly contact the association.</p>
<h3>Jinghua Road, Named After a Woman</h3>
<p>— Ping Zhang</p>
<p>This magazine once published that some roads are named after Chinese surnames, such as Yu Qiaqing Road in the Public Concession, Zhu Baosan Road and Shanzhong Road in the French Concession. Among them, one was still missing, and it was named after a woman, named Jinghua Road, which is located at Lane 430, 430 Haifang Road, at the east end of Xiaoshadu Road. Because it is newly built and the road line is extremely short, it is similar to ordinary alleys. Except for the nearby residents who know it, even the latest Shanghai maps published by various bookstores are missing it, so even people who have lived in Shanghai for a long time know it. The road was opened on January 22, 1937 by the Chinese Education Department of the Public Works Department and erected with road signs to commemorate Ms. Yin Wang Jinghua, the founder and principal of the Jinghua Primary and Secondary School at 527 Haifang Road, for establishing schools. As far as I know, this is the only road in the two concessions named after a woman.</p>
<h3>Life</h3>
<p>— Zongwen</p>
<p>Those who live in this era of storms, I say are happy and great. Because in the reality of our environment, without the pain of life, we can never reflect our fresh life.</p>
<p>When my head was first buried in the water, I felt it was very dark, but as soon as I struggled out of the water, it was as bright as usual. This symbolizes that the darkness and light of the future of life are controlled by oneself!</p>
<h3>Embarrassment</h3>
<p>— Zhang Xin</p>
<p>Embarrassment is an innate human instinct, usually revealed in social life, such as meeting with crowds, encountering celebrities, meeting with elders, or meeting with the opposite sex, one will blush and sweat, feel awkward and uneasy. Under such circumstances, making friends will not be smooth: this can be said to be the disadvantage of embarrassment.</p>
<p>Why embarrassment? It is fear that people will see their own shortcomings and be despised, ridiculed, rebuked, or criticized in their hearts, so they come out with evasion and take getting away from the embarrassing environment as a quick solution.</p>
<p>However, we must pay attention: this is only temporary embarrassment, which only occurs when others are by one's side. When others leave, no matter how embarrassing it is, it can be eliminated. In fact, it has nothing to do with the embarrassing thing itself.</p>
<p>People who forget righteousness for profit and have no morals at all, as long as there is no one around them, will more happily show their shortcomings and not feel embarrassed. How often have we seen the "thinking in the quiet night, sweating with shame endlessly," tender face that is embarrassed alone?</p>
<p>Therefore, whether or not one is embarrassed does not lie in the "person," but especially in the "self"; not in the temporary, but in the permanent; not in the one-sided, but in the whole. If one often feels embarrassed alone, then one will value personality, despise profit and status, understand right and wrong, cherish reputation, wash away one's own shortcomings, and make one's actions and behavior in the world without regrets. This is the advantage of embarrassment.</p>
<p>This world does need some embarrassment of self-awareness. Although embarrassment has its advantages and disadvantages, we must abandon its disadvantages and adopt its advantages. Otherwise, if everyone in the world is not embarrassed, what kind of world would this be?</p>

<h3>The China Child Welfare Association Actively Conducts Educational Work</h3>
<p>— Ding Bingnan</p>
<p>The China Child Welfare Association was established in the 17th year of the Republic of China. Over the years, it has educated and cared for orphaned children, and has implemented separate placements at any time. At present, the association continues to be responsible for the education and care of more than 400 children, whose ages range from newborn to sixteen years old. The association has two institutions for educating and caring for children: one is the Shanghai Child Welfare Education Institute, located at No. 1231, Route Lafayette, Shanghai, and the other is the Shanghai Children's Education Institute, located at No. 639, Zhaojiabang Road, Nanshi, Shanghai. The following is a summary of its educational work:</p>
<p>(1) In terms of teaching, the ordinary primary school system is adopted, and kindergarten and low-ability children's classes are added according to actual needs. The primary school curriculum follows the standards promulgated by the ministry: the kindergarten curriculum focuses on singing and playing, and also includes naps; the low-ability children's class curriculum includes literacy, calligraphy, labor, etc. In terms of guidance, emphasis is placed on individual training, group training, etc. The children are also guided to establish autonomous groups, in order to cultivate the children's ability of self-government and give play to the children's spirit of self-government.</p>
<p>(2) In terms of work, in order to cultivate children's work habits and combine work with learning, it is specifically stipulated that older children must take on planting, animal husbandry, kitchen, tea stove, sewing, shoemaking, hairdressing, laundry, cleaning, repair and other work every day. In order to increase the efficiency of training, inspection and reward methods are also stipulated in order to handle the work carefully and achieve great results. In addition, the association also promotes thrift campaigns, such as having children pick up coke, mend torn clothes, use waste paper to turn over account books, and use waste cloth to tie mops.</p>
<p>(3) In terms of care, attention is paid to the children's clothing, food, and daily life. At present, due to rising prices, old clothes are used as much as possible, and miscellaneous grains such as red beans, sweet potatoes, and corn flour are used as food. In terms of bedrooms, strive for cleanliness, and the staff supervise the children to take care of it themselves. Great emphasis is placed on the individual hygiene and public hygiene of children. Doctors and nurses are hired to conduct regular physical examinations, vaccinate against smallpox, and inject cholera and typhoid fever prevention needles. (4) In terms of placement, education is preparation for placement, and placement is the expansion of education. At present, the association handles placement in three categories: adoption, selection of partners, and introduction to apprenticeships. Generally, young and intelligent children are often adopted as adopted children, while older male and female children are only married or apprenticed. Before placement, a thorough investigation must be conducted, and after placement, staff are often sent to visit in order to ensure perfection. Shanghai is a place where people from all over the world gather, and in order to ensure a bright future for children, we have to take very solemn measures.</p>
<p>Zhabei Free School: Hong Zhenliang, the first village head of Zhabei, and the associated Lianbao chiefs Zhai Xieshen, Wang Zhengui, Zhu Lie, and Zhang Nanbao, etc., in view of the large number of out-of-school children in the northern district of Shanghai, specifically raised funds to establish the First Township Free School at No. 68, Huaxingfang, Huaxing Road, to cultivate poor students.</p>
<p>Gifting Family Instructions: Mr. Zhang Zaiyang's "Xuanlu Family Instructions" cites the difficulties and dangers personally experienced by students and the experience of self-examination and overcoming, which is a good book for young people to cultivate themselves. You can cut this newspaper and go to Yang's, Tongji, Room 211, 3rd Floor, Xinda Xiang Building, No. 614 Nanjing Road to ask for it in person, or send a letter from other places and it will be sent immediately.</p>
<p>Shoe Repair Helps Henan Disaster Relief: Mr. Mao of the Shoe Hospital at the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road heard that there was cannibalism due to the drought in Henan, and donated 500 yuan of his labor income to help with disaster relief. The payment has been transferred to the drought disaster donation collection bank in the province.</p>
<p>Hobby Exhibition Helps Education: The Shanghai East Commune in the Times Building on Fuzhou Road is holding a hobby exhibition, which will be extended for a few more days starting today. I was invited to watch it yesterday. The content includes Ding Fubao and Luo Bozhao's ancient coins, Ganziwei and Xu Xiaohe's silver coins, Guan Jiangmin's banknotes from past dynasties, Zhang's bird cages and Xue's carvings, Lang Jingshan's southwestern scenic spots, Huang Bohui's strange photographs, Qian Wanneng's stamps, Ding Zhen's ideal park, Jin Wuzhou's birds, Zhou Shoujuan's Qingqi and eccentricities, and Xin Ya's special potted landscapes. Among the ten rarities are four-legged people. Song Daren's medical charts have great academic value. Each display stand also has explanations by students from Shanghai University, which makes it even more interesting. The ticket money obtained is all used for compulsory education.</p>
<p>Receipt Report: (1) Poverty Relief Fund: Mr. Zhao Ziguang (Thrift Wedding Ceremony) 400 yuan, balance 49,243.7 yuan. (2) Small Education Medical Assistance Fund: Mr. An Chi Zhongfu 200 yuan, balance 89,779.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Lost and Found: Xie Rongjun found a Bund Park pass. The loser should report the number and pick it up at this office.</p>
