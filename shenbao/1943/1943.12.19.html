<h3>日大本營昨公布新不列顛島戰況　邀襲登陸敵軍獲重大戰果</h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　日大本營十八日下午四時發表：　我守備隊自十二月十五日以來，邀擊在新不列顛島馬加斯角附近登陸之一部敵軍刻正在邀戰中。　十二月十五日揭曉帝國海軍航空部隊發見敵運輸給團駛進馬加斯角海面，當即對之邀擊，翻覆加以猛炸，獲致戰果如次：（甲）第一次轟炸，十二月十五日晨，炸沉敵大型運輸船一艘，小型運輸船三艘·登陸用舟艇三十艘以上，炸毀大型巡洋艦一艘·（或已沉沒）小型運輸船一艘（或已沉沒，）上述各運輸船及登陸用舟艇登陸前，均滿載大批兵員，此意我方有飛機三架未返。（乙）第二次轟炸，十二二月十七日陳，炸沉小型運輸船一艘及載船一艘·大型登陸用舟艇四艘·登陸用舟艇數艘·炸毀小型運輸船二艘（重創）·　船一艘（重創））大型登陸用舟艇二艘（重創·）擊落敵機八架，是役我方有飛機四架未返。又十二月十六日我海軍機隊曾實行空襲·予敵相當損害·惟因　間關係　果不詳。　帝國海軍航空部隊於十二月二十七日晨，邀擊來襲拉巴爾之敵機約四卞架，當擊落共十八架，我方則有二架未返</p>
<p>日軍掌握制空權處有利戰略地位</p>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　美軍於南太平洋之反攻巳伸張至新不列　島，該戰事今後將如何發展，頗難預料。但其當注目者，不外下列各點：　敵軍在南太平洋之反攻，巳由所羅門方面北進違波根維爾島，　觀日軍南方作戰之要點拉巴爾。此次敵軍進抵馬加斯峽，係策應東部新機內亞方面之戰局，形成由兩方面牽制拉巴爾之戰略綫。　空軍在現決戰階段中所佔之地位極為重要，空戰巳負起戰鬥之主要任務，故對於作戰地點，必須以高速率集中大量之空軍兵力。敵在馬加斯角作戰，必須於波根維爾島之特羅基納，或由新幾內亞島東部基地出　。反之，日當則成於有利之戰略地位，可動員拉巴爾之强力空軍力以其距離計，不僅可出動大型飛樣，且可伴以相當數量之戰鬥機，故能充份發揮日海軍機之攻擊力。敵軍現在日軍制空權下，巳遭受空前之犧牲。敵軍雖在拉巴爾所在地之新不列顚島陸續登陸，但因該島有特殊條件，由陸作戰極為屆難，由此而狄·則數所佔之地位為海中獨立區而巳</p>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　據此間軍事權威者談：此次數軍選攻馬加斯角，顧係與去夏以來敵軍所實施之所羅門羣島及新幾內亞作戰相連續者，與侵攻太平洋中部吉爾具特羣島方面戰事當視為一體，欲重創日軍太平洋戰略，蓄本年九月間敵軍先後在羣巴及芬希哈　登陸之用意，在以新幾內亞東部為立足點，企圖突破日方戰略要綫，其後敵方又實行波根維爾島作戰，欲在拉巴爾構築　周之橋頭堡　，今又進犯新不列覆島西南岸之馬加斯角，圖一面牽制拉巴爾，一面呼應新幾內亞東部作戰·確保一足可由中央突破日南方戰略要綫之據點。就緻方在太平洋之蠢動情形而觀，可知敵方題係企圖呼應太平洋中部作戰，切　日軍與日本本土之接　綫，但最近敵軍　渡島西海岸一角登陸，但所付之代價頗大·敵方不股犧牲實行決戰者，巳暴　其內部之苦悶，今敵軍既企圖進攻新不列顚島，則預料其將不顧任何犧牲，由新不列顚島之一角，或波島海域，新盡內亞東部，甚至太平洋方面，展開進攻作戰，但日方巳嚴加防守，準備予以痛擊。</p>
<h3>日泰文化協定　周年紀念　東京籌備慶祝</h3>

<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>日本的增產運動</h3>
<p>— 允中</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭第一年，自猛襲珍珠港開始，迭獲偉大戰果。第二年姓氏稍有變化，除了繼續展開擊滅英美的決戰以外，更推進大東亞的建設專業，進入所謂一面戰爭一面建設的階段。大東亞戰爭進入第三年，為建設與保障大東亞共榮圈而鬥爭，因此强化生產態勢以協助戰爭取決戰的勝利，具有異常重要的意義。</p>
<p>軍需生產之強化</p>
<p>「必勝生產」口號下的主要任務，自然是軍需生產之增強，特別值得注意的是</p>
<p>日本軍需會社法之制定，主要就在排除企業經營上的個人主義與自由主義的殘餘，肅淸營利主義，利潤第一主義，務使所有軍需關係企業之經營，完全在國家的要求之下，統一的進行，以求在最短期內。達成戰力增強的目標，以保障大東亞戰</p>
<p>增强重需生產中最大任務，在於飛機之增產。造裏又分三方面努力：第一，在政治方面，與國家的組織與國家的態勢相連繫，實現所謂「發令定貨之一元化」。日本政府巳於十一月一日創設軍需省，企圖從這一方面推進革新的方案。第二，在技術方面，特別注力於飛機生產技術之硏究與改進，以期達到質量兩方面超過敵方的目標。第三，是在勞務管理方面，集中眞正需要的人員，作合理的分配，使人人發揮其生產報國的實效。</p>
<p>企業整備之促進</p>
<p>日本企業整備之速度，以本年五月一日發表的「戰力增强企業整備要綱」而漸趨急劇。依據該「要綱」，企業整備之目標有二：第一，凡未曾「戰力化」之企業，迅速使之戰力化。即凡非遂行戰爭所必需的企業與生產力，即有計劃地轉用於軍需及其他重要部門，俾發揮最大之效率。其次，為鋼鐵增產，實行收回必需的各種「鐵」：而各種勞動力亦努力使轉換配置於軍需及其他「重點部部門」。</p>
<p>日本企業整備的第二個目標，是使上述重點企業實現組織化與强力化。即依戰爭進展的需要，努力刷新此種部門的生產機能，俾發揮最大限度的生產性。在方法上，主要的是集中產業生產力－即勞動力、資材、動力、運輸力、資金等於軍需及其他重要部門，為求活用，並促進非重點部門企業之調整。</p>
<p>企羹整理之對象，是所謂第一種工業部門。首先有七月二十九日之「織物製造業整備要綱」，繼對各種工業陸續公布整備要綱，並發表四十一種金屬收回令施行細則，大約有八十種企業須置行整理。同時，為增加決戰戰力而强化所謂第二種工業部鬥，使之擴大與合理化。在方法上，一為作業能率之增進，一為經營規模之擴大，而特別注力於產業動員之發展。</p>
<p>生產力之眞正的擴大，除了量的增加之外，尙待質的提高，確立以「集結的生產要素」發揮最大效果的體制，因此特別重視企業部門之整理强化及生產機能之刷新提高。</p>
<p>國民動員之加強</p>
<p>爲求飛機等所謂超重點生產之飛躍的增強，日本政府特別樹立國內態勢強化方策，爲實現「必勝生產」，尤注重於國民動員之强化，例如若干特定的職業，巳經禁止男子就業，並盡力擴大軍事徵用者的範圍，增進徵用用工的能率。</p>
<p>就中徵用範圍之擴大，以軍需會社之整刷，而表示新的企業體制乃至經濟體制之方向。並且爲了增進所徵用的勞動力的工作能率即生產能率，更注九於特殊訓練與敎育，及實現生活保證之制度化。訓練方法，主要的自然是送入國民勤勞訓練所，但以收容能力有限，不少即在各生產工塲內　行，使每一個徵用的國民，都在生產與訓練中成為億全的產業戰士。</p>
<p>其次，為了確保生產力之增强，對於生產者的收入，尤盡一切力量加以保障，主要的是由「國民徽甩援護會」進行各種補給事業。一般的說，以個人計，徵用以後，所受酬給如較從前的收人減少時，就其從前之收人·年齡·家屬人數等，加以充分攷慮，不足者即給予必要的補助。</p>
<p>為着提高「一億國民總崛起德勤勞」之精神，使應徵者無後顧之憂，專心奉公服務，對於家屬遺族之各種援護慰問運動，不遺餘力。特別如十一月二十六日至三十日的「戰力增强國民徵用援護强化運動」，以振作戰時生產精神。同時叉實行工程管理之改善，使一切有生力量「人」和無生力量「物」作有機的配合，改善企業經營與管理，使生產力有取大效能的發揮</p>
<p>「必勝生產」除上述諸端外，更注力於舉國決戰經濟體制之確立，這又可分如下諸點：第一，為運輸效率之增强，力謀原有設備之徹底的合理化。今日運輸上最大問題在於船舶之不足，即努力於船舶增產，對於巳有的運輸工具及設備，則力求其能率增進，卽實現所謂「輸送一元化能率化」，進而實現「海陸一體化，海上及陸上輸送路之合理化」，並停止若干危險航路之航行而注重於陸上運輸。最近新設的「運輸通信省」，卽在適應決戰運輸之新需要而推進「必勝運輸」的新政策。</p>
<p>第二，力謀糧食之自給自足。實行合理化的綜合配給，以期與「必勝生產」相適應而共同達成大東亞戰爭之完全勝利。農商大臣卽會指示昭和十九年（一九四四）米殺年度，將特別注意糧食問題，「講求消費規定，綄合配給之强化等一切方策，極力節約」。今後首先努力於增產，方法上一為平面的增產，卽求耕地之擴充，二為立體的增產，即為集體經營之促進。此外卽力圖消費之規定與節約，代用食品之獎勵，綜合配給，鄕土食品之提倡等等，以求糧食之自給。</p>
<p>第三，通貨膨脹之紡織，爲維持決戰經濟秩序的絕對條件，以期安定民心，確保物與金之均衡，生產·配給·消費之規定，與購買力之吸收。日本政府早曾實行增稅，獎勵儲蓄等直接對策，並力謀金融機構之整備。本年度進而樹立國家資金計劃，改正儲蓄法令，實行强制儲蓄。今後防制通貨膨脹的方針，首為消費之規定，亦即國民最低生活之確保，以求保持國民之購買力，與增加儲蓄效率。</p>
<p>此外，為了强化必勝生產態勢，確立科學技術動員體制。首於八月二十日閣議通過「科學硏究之緊急整備方策要綱」，十月一日閣議通過「確立科學技衝動員綜合方策案」，在大學及其他重要硏究機關設置「科學硏究動員委員會」，確立日本科學技術研究動員體制·十月十四日公布「硏究動員會議官制」，「臨時戰時硏究員設置制」，擴充學術硏究會議之經費，研究費，研究瓷料及專門人才，可時在技術院設立「硏究動員部」而文部省科學局亦特設「硏究動員課」，全面的推進研究動員與計劃科學，配合生產建設車業，充成「必勝生產」態勢。</p>
<p>日本國內生產增強態勢，正適麻大東亞戰爭決戰階段的需要而發展，為最後勝利與共榮圈建設成功的最有力的保障，可是，回顧我國生產建設事業，究有何種新發展？這是政府與企業界所必須深切反省的。</p>

<h3>汪院長訓詞要旨</h3>
<p>南京十八日中央社電　中國合作社各地支社理事長會議，今晨開幕。汪院長派林部長代表行政院，致訓要旨如下：　各地合作社賴盟邦之協助與指導，先後成立，更得盟邦及本國熱心合作事業之人士，努力推進，得以組具規模。本年七月，復承盟邦以此事業交還我國，俾農村復興公作，更得有所着手，茲願於此致其敬意與惑謝。　無論就充實　力，完遂戰爭着眼，抑就改善民生復興建設着眼，增加生廣，皆為當務之急。大東亞戰爭爆發以來，目睹盟邦國民節衣縮食，努力增產，集中力量完遂戰爭，貢獻於國家，置獻於保衞東亞。國府參義以後，吾人旣有參戰之戰務，尤當負起應盡之責任、節衣縮食，努力增產，集中力量，完遂戰爭，貢獻於國家，貢獻於保衛東亞。以言改善民生，民生不安，由於物價高漲，物價高漲，由於物資缺乏。故平抑物價，穩定民生，尤有待於增產工作之推進。政府計劃增產，人民　力增產，而各位則盡力協力求其發展。　然欲增加生產必先保護生產，培養生產力，使生產者竭其全力以赴。於生產之後更能從事於再生產，保護生產者培强生產力，以增加生產。其目的決不在迫求個人之利潤，而在求民生之改善與充實國力，充實戰爭。於此有其偉大之意義，合作運動，對於此點，有其特殊的效能。吾人於此，尤當使生產品有合理之消費，有合理之分配，此乃為合作社設置之目的，亦為合作社最大之使命。現在政府對於增產運動，正在計劃推進之中，盟邦方面，亦將予以極大的協助。深望諸君本旣有之基礎，更求充實，以協助增產工作之發展，期使改簪民生，與貢獻力量於完遂戰爭兩大目標，同時貫澈，　吾人審衡現狀，在都市必須肅淸英美思想的毒素，肅清買辦主義的毒素在。農村必須肅清封建思想的渣滓·肅淸共產主義的流毒。都市方面思想之毒素茲姑不具論，就農付得封建思想言之，昔人所謂「勞心者治人，勞力者治於人」。時至今日，封建思想已成過去，國家社會對於「勞動」之評價，巳非從前之觀念。吾人要使每一個國民，均為國家民族的勞動者，斯足配稱為新國民。此其意義在戰時體制之下，尤易明瞭，吾人應深切認識，吾人不勞而獲之不當。惟能勞動然後能享其用，故新國民運動不僅注重於精神訓於勞動服務之實踐。深望各位努力發揚勞動之時代精神，從而廓淸。都市靑年，尤其農村靑年，過去封建思想之渣滓，就共產主義之流毒言之，過共練以　人放火為其手段。民十六年以來，農村被產，社會不安，造端於是。直至最近，雖有時變更作風，而其欺騙農民，剝削農民。犧牲農民之暴行，曾未稍減。合作運動根本方針，在求農村之復興，農民生活之安定與向上，深信各位早已深惡痛絕共匪之摧殘民力，而堅決負起其根本摧毀共產主義毒素之偉大使命。　為實施以上各項，必先喚起一般農民，尤其農村靑年，施之以嚴密組織，施之以嚴格訓練，使之努力增產，使之增產進技術，使之與封建思想共產暴徒作殊死戰。深望各位對於合作運動，與農村靑年組訓工作，協力共進。　各位在本屆大會提案，對於增加生產農村社會之改進，新國民運動之推進，與農村靑年組訓工作，均有具體完善之方案，至為敬佩。此次大會，必能獲得圓滿之結果，可以預卜，深望大會之後，一心一德，努力實行。</p>

<h3>京靑少年發起　禁舞禁毒禁賭運動</h3>
<p>南京十八日中央社電　大東亞戰爭迄今，巳臨決戰階段，前方戰事，巳奠定必勝之基礎，而我國參戰後，國民應如何刻苦耐勞·節約增產，以期貢獻於大東亞戰爭，但反觀國內尙有執迷不悟之徒，沉緬聲色，每日沒淫於舞塲吸烟室或賭博，徒事　耗。物價之飛騰，民生之不安，固多由是而起，抑且影響戰時人民意識之昻揚。首都全市靑少年，環顧此黑暗現象，激於正義之自覺，為勵行戰時生活，井體認靑少年總奮起運動之宗旨，特於十七日、自動在靑年館集合各校一靑少年千餘人，議決嚴　實行禁烟禁舞禁賭，印發宣言，及抗議要求書，標語口號等。幷即往各舞塲，售吸所，勸導宣傳，期沉溺於聲色歌舞戕身毒窟之人，幡然猛省。</p>
<h3>敵方總反攻的崩潰　日本大本營海軍報道課長栗原大佐　陸軍報道課長松村大佐對談</h3>
<p>松村大佐</p>
<p>是呀。例如吃到一記波根維爾的耳光，以及在一年後始行發表夏威夷的損失等，完全和這方不同。還有一點，日本和美國也是相異的，就是敵方常用數字來宣傳。例如飛機十二萬五千架呀，鐵的生產如何如何呀，拼命用數字來示威，可是，從對方傳來的情報看，其數字常有出入，所以不可置信之點頗多，要之，美國的辦法便是將不利的事情瞞住國民。</p>
<p>至於他們的戰後計畫，也暗暗以戰勝為前提的。至若戰爭的實際情况，日本對於自己的作戰行動，從來不作宣傳，但他們在有所動作時，必於一·二日前大吹大擂，高喊反攻啦反攻啦。例如吉爾伯特等戰事，尼米資在展開軍事行動之煎，即表示他正注目中太平洋。看到這種宣傳先於戰爭的情形，不禁令人感到他們是為了宣傳而戰爭的。美國的宜傳竟到這樣的程度！</p>
<p>這次的戰爭是家族主義和個人主義國家的戰爭。戰爭愈廷長，戰况愈悽慘，而家族主義的國家不正表現其底力嗎？這種日本的長處——即人的長處和家族制度的長處，日木國民必須明白自覺。</p>
<p>栗原大佐</p>
<p>我想，今日這樣，企業整備旣着着進展，飛機固要緊，其他東西的生產亦不放鬆，各就本位努力，那就是戰勝之道。</p>
<p>松村大佐</p>
<p>一億若不早就戰門配置，那才糟糕！所以企業整備等中途發生的問題，應盡量迅速解決？一億國民苟各就戰門配置，不尙理論，祗務實際，努力認眞幹去，那才可以發揮總力，產生成效。</p>
<h3>總力的結集</h3>
<p>栗原大佐　怎麼樣？來下結論吧。</p>
<p>松村大佐</p>
<p>這次的戰爭是迄今為止的戰史上所沒有的戰爭。今日以前的戰爭，或以歐洲為舞臺，或以中國，滿洲或北美為舞臺，都以局部的區城為戰塲，但遭次戰爭則隔大四，太平兩洋，以全世界為戰場，而在這梯的大戰塲上，將强國分為軸心與反軸心兩陣營，這的確是人類有史以來的大戰。並且戰爭的進行方式，從前大體祇以軍隊及養戰之錢為主力，而這次戰爭較以前第一次大戰時由所謂軍需工業動員而成的戰爭形態更進一步，可說是總力改組的戰爭。為使平時企業生產飛機，軍艦和大砲，於是整頓企業，全體改行為軍需產業·並使國家組織本身也適應戰爭，在這樣改組而成的組織上，發揮總力，實行戰爭，進化到煎綫後方混然沒有區別的階段</p>
<p>從兵力這點看，拿破侖攻入莫斯科時，祇用四十四，五萬人，若和今日動員一千萬的情形比較·相差實鉅，從而由消耗的軍械，彈藥，飛機，潛艇等各種武器看，其消耗量亦非常之大。</p>
<p>近頃，成為戰爭主角者便是近代戰武器之寵兒的飛機。在日本正在進行戰爭的海洋，島嶼方面，飛機大發揮其威力。至於德蘇戰綫方面，戰車在那樣大規模的陸戰中，也縱横馳騁，大顯身手。所以飛機和戰車在今日巳成武器中最大的寵兒了。由於這種關係，科學兵器的消耗量和生產量，都巳非常加增，所以工廠也成很大的問題。</p>
<p>第一次大戰終、飛機發達，因而關於以後的戰爭，短期戰論非常多，德皇威廉亦曾預言第一次大戰以後的戰爭，由於飛機的發達，在四十八小時以內就可結束，可是和這種預言完全相反，第二次大戰因飛機的發達，反有長期化的傾向。珍珠灣的赫赫戰果以後，苟無飛機，或許在那一戰中便可決定這次戰局亦未可知，然而因為每日能夠造出幾百架飛機，所以不論擊墜多少架數，還是同今日一樣未能迅即解決戰爭。</p>
<p>在波蘭，法國那樣的狹小區域內，雖早巳實行閃電戰，而且都已成功，然戰區較廣時，由於飛行基地的威力圈及補給關係，交戰區域愈大，戰事便愈難簡單解決。於是戰爭本身便帶着長期戰爭化的傾向。近來常常提到補給戰三個字，這大概都因戰塲距離本國或基地太遠，故需更多的船，更多的兵，更多的飛機。蓋距離一遠，現有武力如從全體而看，便有力量减弱的傾向。在這一點上，戰爭也就有了頗難早日結束的傾向，再則，因為物質的消費非常龐大，所以從反面想，地方的喪失並不成為問題，倒是物資的大消耗才是戰爭的關鍵所在，所謂消耗戰者，即在給與敵人大打擊，使其飽嚐戰爭慘禍，所以不一定要攻取廣大的土地，也可達到戰爭目的。今日是有這種傾向的。不論怎樣，都須國民團結一致，努力從事總力戰。而且變　　內的組織可以增加力量，倘若為了戰爭目的而集中一切，則可成為非常高度的東四，繼經從事難以決定勝負的戰爭是在所不免的。</p>
<p>我以為在現代的戰爭中，最要緊的事情就是舉起總力。在其實力中，包含精神力與物質力。這種精神力不獨可以無限發揚，而且駕駛飛機者是人，製造飛機者亦是人。極度發揮這種精神力，我想是最要緊的。由此物質力亦得提高。成為飛機增產的根底者，就是人類。憑着人類的努力，如你剛才說過，是能夠逐漸打開狹路的。總之，精神輿物質相俟而提高戰力是必要的。朗寇（Ranke）强國論中說：「國家對外的威信並非隨便得來的，是憑實力漸漸漸築成的，因此非集中各種力量不可。」我想，所謂勝利者便是最高度集中發揮國家的各種力量。戰爭越拖延，實力越增加的一方，才可操勝利的左券，所以這實力的種向上是最要緊的。</p>
<p>栗原大佐</p>
<p>從海戰方面說，日美英世界三大海軍國現在正分為兩個壁壘，以全世界七大洋為大舞台，演出全武行，所以是戰史上迄今未見的壯絕大戰。正如最初所說，這次海戰中發生的新現象，便是在今日以前的海戰中，以戰艦隊的中核其他艦艇則係所謂補助都隊。例如前次大戰的遮德　海戰，奧克蘭海戰或其他海戰，都以戰艦為戰爭的中心，但在這次大戰中，飛機發揮其非常的威力，現出我們所想像不到的偉大力量。迄今稱為海上王者的威容堂堂的巨大戰艦，尙且吃不消飛機的魚雷和炸彈而沉沒。這件事從夏威夷·馬來洋面海戰以來，在其後多次海空戰中，業巳證實。而且，戰艦等的建造需要長久的年月，反之，飛機則每日可以造出幾十架幾百架。因此，縱然擊沉了多少敵方戰艦，仍不能結束戰爭。</p>
<p>如你剛才所說，倘若是過去，美國太平洋艦隊旣因夏威夷一擊而陷於半身不隨，戰爭當可告終了。可是在這次戰爭中，飛機成為戰爭舞台上得要角，而且是比戰艦更要緊的重　，又可大量生產，結果，僅僅擊沈戰艦依然不能握取戰爭的決定權。美國雖然喪失不少戰艦，而仍打算以飛機為中心展開大反攻，由此即可明白。</p>
<p>結果，依仗飛機的威力而握取制空　時，制海權也有八·九分在握了。而且海洋異於陸地，旣沒有防空壕可躱，也沒有什麽可以閃避飛機攻擊的遮蔽物。</p>
<p>我想，飛機無異是射程很長的大砲，也可說是射程很長的魚雷，而飛機的續航距離便是它的射程，敵方艦船駛入其射程中時，即可成為飛機的攻擊目標。因此，現在得海戰與從來不同，常有展開激戰的機會，換一句話說，就是富於機動性·</p>
<p>日俄戰爭時，日本艦隊在佐世保，俄國艦隊在旅順，雙方為了某種戰略目的而實行接近·然則何事發生海戰呢？那就在兩方進入大砲射程內的時候，就是在駛入一萬公尺或二萬公尺這種極近的距離內時。</p>
<p>現在呢，祗要敵方艦船侵入飛機的長「射程」內，或如道敵軍在何處有了基地，一有機會的話，便可不分晝夜地實行攻擊·所以現在的戰爭，陸上戰鬥固巳不消說得，就是在廣大的洋上，發生海戰的機會也是非常之多的。結果，所謂大消耗便隨之而生，於是成為消耗戰，需要舉全國總力以戰的性格，亦更是强大。所以希望國民認識這點，傾全力生產飛機，增强戰力。（全文完）（吉：譯自十二月六日七日朝日新聞）</p>

<p>改善食米配給</p>
<p>（新中國報問）本市警務當局巳一再聲明嚴禁黑市米糧販賣，但戶口米配給糧又不敷食用，未悉常局有良好之增加配給糧之辦法否？使市民不必購買黑市米糧，而黑市自行絕跡。（中央社問）自米糧聯營社撤廢改設米糧統制會後，一般市民對之，期望頗殷，盛傳戶口米即將增加，迄今巳達三月，而戶口米非獨未予增加，抑且反由二升減至一升，且脫期三次，而此三次米票復由當局公佈改領食油，試問此所存三期米糧，將如何處置？又每旬每人配給米一升，麵粉一斤，自屬不夠，不得不求諸黑市，而黑市米又在當局取締之例，兹者糧食局新局長業巳接事，對米統會有否會同辦法，對民食問題，有澈底之解決否：二問題因糧食局代表不到，暫緩答復。</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>中國絲業前途</h3>
<p>昨在「限制企業增資」一文中，曾言公司工廠於提價增股之中，不可不愼防股　之過份膨脹，實因短視的企業家，往往犯着一個通病，就是祗顧目前之營利，不顧營業之前途，結果遂皆　本而逐末了。例如，以中國的絲業而論，這是與中國人民穿衣問題有何等重大關係的一個重工業，中國要改良絲業來增加生產，必須在種種方面，從根做起，談何容易？難道單靠幾家以綢縀公司為號召的所謂　絲業界，斤斤以絲業股債之漲落為喜戚者，便能侈談中國絲業的前途　？</p>
<p>以盟邦日本而論，自從大東亞戰爭中日本生絲輸出的杜絕，反而因此樹立日本　　業技術革命的基礎。現今日本蠶絲業對於增强戰力的貢獻是：　有助於軍需生產，如有最新發明之「絲製革」，　有助於食糧增產，例如以蠶蛹製各種食用油，調味品，以及醬油，　有助於國內　維資源，例如以蠶絲和人造纖維承棉花與羊毛輸入之乏，而有生絲的羊毛代用技術，都是日本絲業前途的曙光。</p>
<p>以前中國的絲質不好，外國既不要用，中國自己也不喜用，途至中國人民穿衣的材料，幾於完全仰給於外國的洋布洋紗，而富家所用的華美絲織品，亦都輪自外國，言之痛心。如今，這一類的輸入斷絕，正乃中國發展絲業的黃金機會，急宜由政府與人民互相提倡中國蠶絲業的技術革命，不但要改良　蠶和紡絲方法，並且要使中國的蠶絲業，有助於其他方面，如對於軍需與食糧之貢獻，那末，中國絲業前途，便覺未可限量了！</p>
<h3>當局為執行限價　將作全面澈查</h3>
<p>近因煤斤缺乏及電流限制關係，物價又見猛烈上漲，據關查所得，一船物價又漲幾成。當局對此，巳寄予密切注意。記者頃自關係方面獲悉，當局即將大規模展開執行限價措置，目前正分配大批調查人員，預備於最短期內赴全市各公司行號作全面澈查，其調查對象主要者為：　是否超越限價，　陳列貨品是否均有標價，　貨品是否置放於門市顯著地位，有否　貨拒售情事，　發售貨品是否開具發票，　是否使用不合標凖之度量　器等，必要時並得查　帳册。至於各業如確因成本高　而　調整價格者，必須備具充分理由，向當局申請，俟當局調查屬實核准外，方可改變價目，如有私抬價格情事，一經查出，定予嚴懲</p>
<h3>交易所監理會　密查股票商</h3>
<p>上海交易所監理委員會自證勞開拍以來，監理殊嚴，以期正常投資得臻　全之途，近以股票價格漲落甚鉅，昨又令證交云：「查股票市價之漲落對於投資者之正常賣買，暨金融物價之安定，直接間接俱有深切關係，邇來該所股票市塲，價格上下相差甚鉅，其間難免無不法商人從中作變相投機揉縱等行為，以達其非法牟利之目的，殊堪注意，本會除隨時派員密查外，該所應即詳查具報以憑核辦，如果其間確有違法情事，亦應迅即報請本會轉呈政府，從嚴懲處，毋得徇縱，切切此令。又聞該會現已遷漢口路十號中央信託公司大樓辦公，電話一八八四〇號云。</p>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪羊譯</p>
<p>十</p>
<p>眞人不開　的心理，自從受了那器械體操的影響，越發的堅强了。天天的攀着鐵槓子，不知不覺的，單槓，倒懸，也都很容易的會做了。別的學生會做的事，無論什麼，也都能做得來了。這都是努力的報酬，好勝心的結晶。雖在少年的心中，也深切地感到自信的力量，和征服外物的欣悅。</p>
<p>（我也是不能屈服於人的男子）</p>
<p>這樣想着，他那不服輸的心裏，也隨之成長起來了。於是，眞人對鐵槓子和横木，遽然感到興趣，雖在放學後，也要誘引牟四口隆夫等，飛跑到操塲去。</p>
<p>「眞人，轉風車，會麽？」</p>
<p>隆夫這樣的問着。</p>
<p>轉風車，在小朋友之中，也是絕無僅有的。不過體育的先生，有時候做個樣子，給學生們看看罷了。</p>
<p>「能夠。」眞人，無意地滑出了口。</p>
<p>旣然說了，就不能不實行。以前曾經在背地裏試演過，一半是失敗了，而一半是成功了的。他使盡了可能的反動力，將身軀狠命的轉了一下。</p>
<p>（到底成功了！）</p>
<p>他這樣一安心的當兒，模糊地，頭暈起來了。因為是危險的還動，只轉了一回，就跳到砂土上了。自巳還以為是跳得很正當，但是，左肩上的骨頭，却咯吱的響了一聲。</p>
<p>當時倒沒覺到怎樣，在歸途中，左手就不得自由了。並且，到傍晚就開始痛起來，半夜裏竟痛得睡不着覺了。</p>
<p>『為什麽幹那樣的危險的玩意見？」</p>
<p>對於孩子們，着了凉的輕病，一向連眉梢也不動一下的母親，而現在對於這孩子，將來有成為殘廢的危險，所以口吻却相當的嚴厲。並且他通夜的用濕手巾。敷在眞人的肩上。</p>
<p>第二天早晨，把他帶到醫生那裏去診斷，據說是錯了骨縫。用手一指，就要痛得暴跳起來，而　　師毫不留情地，塗上了藥，用藥布緊緊地包上了。眞人、將視綫移到醫室的白壁子上，咬着牙根忍耐着。這並不僅是平素的不服氣作用。。（媽媽在身旁！）他不忍因為自己的　失，而使母親掛心，必須盡量的顯示出病症的輕微。</p>
<p>從那天以後，眞人，向學校告了一星期的假，幸而，經過很好，已經不很痛了，也毋須向母親撤無用的謊。</p>
<p>「以後，自己會好的。』</p>
<p>他故意地，聳着肩膀，到學校去了。</p>
<h3>洛陽路上一醫院　上海南洋醫院參觀記</h3>
<p>完善的治療設備</p>
<p>改造後的院舍，雖然在醫學上嚴格的說尙未十分滿意，但與上海一般大醫院比較起來，巳經可以算得是第一等的了　看吧，總務室，工作室，以至各系各科的治療室，化騐室，是那樣合理地分配在每一系列的病房中間，差不多每一個病人，都有一羣醫師，護士和各種治療工具包圍着，差不多每一病人的一呼吸一脈搏，都被小心地關切着。一層，二層，以至三層樓，每一層甚至每一組病房都構成一個治療與　護的系統，而各系統間又維持着親密的聯繫。單從院舍內房室的分配部署來看，己可看出這是如何科擊化，計畫化和組織化的大醫院。假如我是一個病人親屬來探訪，看到了這樣周密的佈置，就可以放下一百二十個心，不再為病人擔憂了。</p>
<p>三層巨厦裏，總共八十個病房，二百架床飾，（包括陪病人用床五十架），這裏就有百分之四十以上是貧病的床舖。看看貧病的房間吧，每一房內配置着四至五架床舖，貧病小兒科病房每間收容七八人，一律是錮絲鐵床，配着潔白的被褥床單等，簡單淸潔而安靜，沒有一般醫院三等病房那種「統船」式的感覺。從這裏多少可以看出該院對於貧苦病人的愛護，決不出於虛矯或佈施的心情，而是依據人羣博愛互助的服務道德。</p>
<p>為着適應現社會的實隙情形及一般中等以上市民的心理，南洋醫院也在病房中特別劃出一部分房間，作為「二等」和「頭等」病房，在形式及內部佈置方面，自然要精美一些。你看，二等病房每間只有一架病床，一只小桌子，窗口還點綴着些盆景，多麽靜謐啊，病人在還裏可以靜靜地忘去塵囂的社會和一切憂盧吧！</p>
<p>頭等病房的佈置更加精美，這裏附有浴室，冬天有水汀，夏天有風扇，還特設陪病者的床舖，看來很像什麽總統號皇后號等豪華巨輪裏的特等艙房，在安靜淸凈中兼有富麗的色彩，令人有溫暖舒適之感。</p>
<p>再來看看現代化的醫療設備吧！首先是充滿着機械化，氣息的理瞭科，靜靜地陳列着Ｘ光透視及　影設備，Ｘ光治療超短波，透熱洽療機、紫外綫及太陽燈等，試擰一下電掣，黑暗中，發出驚奇的强烈的光彩，多麽偉大的科學的機械之力！</p>

<h3>Japanese Headquarters Announced New Britain Island Battle Situation Yesterday: Ambushing Landing Enemy Troops Achieved Significant Results</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4 PM on the 18th: Since December 15th, our garrison troops have been ambushing a portion of enemy troops that landed near Cape Gloucester on New Britain Island and are currently engaged in battle. On December 15th, the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force discovered an enemy transport fleet entering the waters off Cape Gloucester. An immediate ambush and fierce bombing resulted in the following achievements: (A) First Bombing: On the morning of December 15th, one enemy large transport ship and three small transport ships, as well as over thirty landing craft, were sunk. One large cruiser was destroyed (or possibly sunk), and one small transport ship (or possibly sunk). All of the aforementioned transport ships and landing craft were fully loaded with a large number of soldiers before landing. In this action, three of our aircraft did not return. (B) Second Bombing: On the morning of December 17th, one small transport ship and one supply ship, as well as four large landing craft and several landing craft, were sunk. Two small transport ships were destroyed (heavily damaged), one supply ship (heavily damaged), and two large landing craft (heavily damaged). Eight enemy aircraft were shot down. In this action, four of our aircraft did not return. Furthermore, on December 16th, our naval air squadron conducted an air raid, inflicting considerable damage on the enemy. However, due to weather conditions, the exact results are unknown. On the morning of December 27th, the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force ambushed approximately forty enemy aircraft attacking Rabaul, shooting down a total of eighteen. Two of our aircraft did not return.</p>
<p>Japanese Forces Control Air Supremacy, Holding Advantageous Strategic Position</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The American counteroffensive in the South Pacific has extended to New Britain Island. It is difficult to predict how the battle will develop in the future. However, the following points should be noted: The enemy's counteroffensive in the South Pacific has progressed northward from the Solomon Islands towards Bougainville Island, aiming at Rabaul, a key point in the Japanese southern operations. The enemy's advance to Cape Gloucester is to support the battle situation in eastern New Guinea, forming a strategic line to contain Rabaul from two directions. The role of the air force is extremely important in the current decisive stage. Air combat has assumed the primary mission of battle. Therefore, for operational locations, a large air force must be concentrated at high speed. The enemy's operation at Cape Gloucester must originate from Torokina on Bougainville Island or from bases in eastern New Guinea. Conversely, Japan is in an advantageous strategic position, capable of mobilizing the strong air force of Rabaul. Judging by the distance, not only can large aircraft be dispatched, but they can also be accompanied by a considerable number of fighter planes, thus fully leveraging the attack power of the Japanese naval air force. The enemy has suffered unprecedented sacrifices under Japanese air supremacy. Although enemy troops have been continuously landing on New Britain Island, where Rabaul is located, the island has special conditions, making land operations extremely difficult. As a result, what the enemy occupies is merely an isolated area in the sea.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to military authorities here: The enemy's choice to attack Cape Gloucester this time is a continuation of the operations in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea that the enemy has been conducting since last summer, and should be considered as one with the battles in the Gilbert Islands in the central Pacific. To seriously damage the Japanese Pacific strategy, the enemy landed in Lae and Finschhafen in New Guinea around September of this year, intending to use eastern New Guinea as a base to break through the Japanese strategic line. Subsequently, the enemy conducted the Bougainville Island operation, aiming to build a surrounding bridgehead at Rabaul. Now, they are invading Cape Gloucester on the southwest coast of New Britain Island, attempting to contain Rabaul on one hand and coordinate with the eastern New Guinea operation on the other, securing a base from which they can break through the Japanese southern strategic line in the center. Judging from the enemy's movements in the Pacific, it can be seen that the enemy is attempting to coordinate with the operations in the central Pacific, cutting off the Japanese connection between the Japanese forces and the Japanese mainland. However, the recent enemy landing on a corner of the west coast of the island has come at a great cost. The enemy's disregard for sacrifices in engaging in decisive battles reveals their internal distress. Now that the enemy is attempting to attack New Britain Island, it is expected that they will launch offensives from a corner of New Britain Island, the waters off Bougainville Island, eastern New Guinea, or even the Pacific, regardless of any sacrifices. However, the Japanese side has strengthened its defenses and is prepared to inflict a painful blow.</p>
<h3>Japan-Thailand Cultural Agreement Anniversary: Tokyo Prepares for Celebrations</h3>

<h3>Japan's Increased Production Campaign</h3>
<p>– Yun Zhong</p>
<p>In the first year of the Greater East Asia War, starting with the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, great victories were achieved repeatedly. In the second year, there were some changes, and in addition to continuing to engage in the decisive battle to destroy Britain and America, the construction of Greater East Asia was further promoted, entering the so-called stage of simultaneous war and construction. In the third year of the Greater East Asia War, fighting for the construction and protection of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, it is therefore of unusually important significance to strengthen the production posture to assist the war in achieving a decisive victory.</p>
<p>Strengthening Military Production</p>
<p>The main task under the slogan of "Certain Victory Production" is naturally to strengthen military production. Particular attention should be paid to the enactment of the Japanese Military Supplies Company Law, which is mainly aimed at eliminating the remnants of individualism and liberalism in business management, eliminating profit-seeking and profit-first principles, and ensuring that the management of all military supplies-related enterprises is completely under the requirements of the state and unified, in order to achieve the goal of enhancing combat power in the shortest possible time to protect the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>The greatest task in enhancing heavy-demand production is to increase aircraft production. Efforts are being made in three areas: First, in the political aspect, it is connected with the organization and situation of the country to achieve the so-called "unification of ordering and supply." The Japanese government established the Ministry of Military Supplies on November 1st, attempting to promote innovative plans from this aspect. Second, in the technical aspect, special attention is paid to the research and improvement of aircraft production technology, with the aim of surpassing the enemy in both quality and quantity. Third, in terms of labor management, truly needed personnel are concentrated, and a reasonable allocation is made so that everyone can exert their effectiveness in producing to serve the country.</p>
<p>Promoting Enterprise Consolidation</p>
<p>The speed of Japanese enterprise consolidation has gradually accelerated since the announcement of the "Essentials for Consolidating Enterprises to Enhance Combat Power" on May 1st of this year. According to the "Essentials," there are two goals for enterprise consolidation: First, to quickly convert enterprises that have not been "combatized" into combat power. That is, all enterprises and productivity that are not necessary for carrying out the war are systematically transferred to military supplies and other important sectors, so as to maximize efficiency. Secondly, in order to increase steel production, efforts are made to recover all kinds of necessary "iron," and various labor forces are also working hard to transfer and allocate to military supplies and other "key sectors."</p>
<p>The second goal of Japanese enterprise consolidation is to organize and strengthen the aforementioned key enterprises. That is, in accordance with the needs of the war's progress, efforts are made to refresh the production functions of these sectors in order to maximize productivity. In terms of methods, the main thing is to concentrate industrial production forces - namely labor, materials, power, transportation, capital - in military supplies and other important sectors, in order to utilize them, and to promote the adjustment of enterprises in non-key sectors.</p>
<p>The object of enterprise consolidation is the so-called first type of industrial sector. First, there was the "Essentials for Consolidating the Textile Manufacturing Industry" on July 29th, followed by the promulgation of consolidation essentials for various industries, and the issuance of detailed rules for the implementation of the 41 types of metal recovery orders. Approximately 80 types of enterprises need to be consolidated. At the same time, in order to increase the decisive battle power, the so-called second type of industrial sectors are strengthened to expand and rationalize them. In terms of methods, one is to increase operational efficiency, and the other is to expand the scale of operations, with special attention paid to the development of industrial mobilization.</p>
<p>The true expansion of productivity, in addition to quantitative increases, also requires qualitative improvements, and the establishment of a system in which "gathered production factors" can maximize their effectiveness. Therefore, special emphasis is placed on the consolidation and strengthening of enterprise sectors and the refreshing and improvement of production functions.</p>
<p>Strengthening National Mobilization</p>
<p>In order to achieve a leap in the production of aircraft and other so-called ultra-priority products, the Japanese government has specifically established domestic strengthening policies. In order to realize "certain victory production," particular emphasis is placed on strengthening national mobilization. For example, men are now prohibited from employment in certain specific occupations, and efforts are being made to expand the scope of military conscription and increase the efficiency of conscripted labor.</p>
<p>The expansion of the scope of conscription, in particular, represents the direction of the new enterprise system and even the economic system through the consolidation of military supplies companies. Furthermore, in order to increase the work efficiency, that is, the production efficiency, of the conscripted labor force, more attention is paid to special training and education, and the institutionalization of the livelihood guarantee system is realized. The main training method is naturally to send them to the National Labor Training Center, but with limited accommodation capacity, many are conducted directly within various production factories, so that every conscripted citizen becomes a full-fledged industrial warrior in production and training.</p>
<p>Secondly, in order to ensure the enhancement of productivity, the income of producers is guaranteed to the best of our ability. The main thing is that the "National Conscription Support Association" carries out various supply businesses. Generally speaking, if the remuneration received after conscription is less than the previous income, the necessary subsidies are given after fully considering the previous income, age, number of family members, etc.</p>
<p>In order to enhance the spirit of "100 million citizens rising up in diligent labor" and to ensure that conscripts have no worries and can concentrate on public service, no effort is spared in various support and condolence movements for families and bereaved families. In particular, the "Combat Power Enhancement National Conscription Support Strengthening Movement" from November 26th to 30th was used to boost the spirit of wartime production. At the same time, improvements in project management were implemented to organically coordinate all living forces "people" and inanimate forces "things," improve business management, and maximize the effectiveness of productivity.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned points, "certain victory production" also focuses on the establishment of a national decisive battle economic system, which can be divided into the following points: First, in order to enhance transportation efficiency, efforts are made to thoroughly rationalize existing equipment. The biggest problem in transportation today is the shortage of ships, that is, efforts are made to increase ship production, and for existing transportation tools and equipment, efforts are made to increase their efficiency, that is, to realize the so-called "unification and efficiency of transportation," and then to realize "the integration of sea and land and the rationalization of sea and land transportation routes," and to stop the navigation of certain dangerous routes and focus on land transportation. The newly established "Ministry of Transport and Communications" is adapting to the new needs of decisive battle transport and promoting the new policy of "certain victory transport."</p>
<p>Second, efforts are made to achieve self-sufficiency in food. Implement rationalized comprehensive distribution in order to adapt to "certain victory production" and jointly achieve the complete victory of the Greater East Asia War. The Minister of Agriculture and Commerce will instruct that in the rice-killing year of Showa 19 (1944), special attention will be paid to the food problem, and "all measures such as consumption regulations and the strengthening of comprehensive distribution will be taken to conserve as much as possible." In the future, we will first strive to increase production, one method is plane increase production, that is, to expand arable land, and the second is three-dimensional increase production, that is, to promote collective management. In addition, efforts are made to regulate and conserve consumption, encourage substitute foods, comprehensive distribution, and promote local foods, etc., in order to achieve self-sufficiency in food.</p>
<p>Third, the spinning and weaving of currency inflation is an absolute condition for maintaining the order of the decisive battle economy, in order to stabilize the people's hearts and ensure the balance between things and money, the regulation of production, distribution, and consumption, and the absorption of purchasing power. The Japanese government has long implemented direct countermeasures such as increasing taxes and encouraging savings, and has also striven to improve financial institutions. This year, it has further established a national capital plan, revised savings laws, and implemented compulsory savings. In the future, the policy of preventing currency inflation will first be the regulation of consumption, that is, ensuring the minimum living standards of the people, in order to maintain the purchasing power of the people and increase savings efficiency.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to strengthen the posture of certain victory production, we must establish a scientific and technological mobilization system. First, the cabinet passed the "Essentials for the Emergency Consolidation of Scientific Research" on August 20th, and the "Comprehensive Plan for Establishing Scientific and Technological Mobilization" on October 1st. "Scientific Research Mobilization Committees" were established in universities and other important research institutions to establish a Japanese scientific and technological research mobilization system. On October 14th, the "Official System of the Research Mobilization Conference" and the "Temporary Wartime Researcher Installation System" were promulgated to expand the funding, research funds, research materials, and specialized talents of the Academic Research Conference. At the same time, the "Research Mobilization Department" was established in the Technology Institute, and the Science Bureau of the Ministry of Education also specially established the "Research Mobilization Section" to comprehensively promote research mobilization and planned science, cooperate with production and construction enterprises, and complete the "certain victory production" posture.</p>
<p>Japan's domestic production enhancement posture is developing in accordance with the needs of the decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, and is the most powerful guarantee for the final victory and the successful construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. However, looking back at our country's production and construction undertakings, what new developments have there been? This is something that the government and the business community must deeply reflect on.</p>

<h3>Chairman Chen Delivers Opening Remarks</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency Telegram) – At the meeting of directors from various regions of the Cooperative Enterprise Committee of the Executive Yuan, Chairman Chen Junci delivered the opening remarks as follows: "The foundation of our country's cooperative enterprise was laid after several years of struggle after the incident, and we have what we have today. At this time of promoting wartime economic policies, it is of particular significance to strengthen cooperatives to launch a cooperative movement, and there is really no better way to revitalize the countryside and stabilize life than through cooperative enterprises. The mission of cooperatives can be summarized in the following five points: To promote the spirit of autonomy, to promote wartime economic policies, to promote the exchange of materials and improve the material distribution system, to regulate rural finance, and to assist in public security and revitalize rural welfare facilities. The focus of cooperative work in the future must first be the spirit of great impartiality, second, personnel must be reorganized, third, there must be a sound organization, and fourth, business must be enriched. It is hoped that everyone will do their best to discuss honestly, so that our country's cooperative business can make an epoch-making advance and do its best to assist in the completion of the Greater East Asia War."</p>
<h3>Main Points of President Wang's Instructions</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The meeting of directors of local branches of the Chinese Cooperative Society opened this morning. President Wang sent Minister Lin as a representative of the Executive Yuan to give instructions, the main points of which are as follows: Local cooperatives have been established one after another with the assistance and guidance of allied countries, and have been further promoted by people from allied countries and our own country who are enthusiastic about the cooperative business, so that they can form a scale. In July of this year, the allied countries returned this business to our country, so that rural revitalization and public work can be started. I would like to express my respect and gratitude here. Whether from the perspective of enriching [ ] power and completing the war, or from the perspective of improving people's livelihood and revitalizing construction, increasing production is a matter of urgency. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, I have witnessed the people of allied countries saving food and clothing, working hard to increase production, concentrating their efforts to complete the war, and contributing to the country and to the defense of East Asia. Since the National Government participated in the righteous cause, we have the responsibility of participating in the war, and we must also bear the responsibilities that we should fulfill, save food and clothing, work hard to increase production, concentrate our efforts, complete the war, and contribute to the country and to the defense of East Asia. In terms of improving people's livelihood, the people's livelihood is unstable due to high prices, and high prices are due to a lack of materials. Therefore, stabilizing prices and stabilizing people's livelihood depends on the promotion of production increase work. The government plans to increase production, the people [ ] to increase production, and all of you are doing your best to cooperate in seeking its development. However, to increase production, we must first protect production, cultivate productivity, and enable producers to do their best. After production, they can also engage in reproduction, protect producers, strengthen productivity, and increase production. The purpose is definitely not to pursue personal profits, but to seek the improvement of people's livelihood and the enrichment of national power, and to enrich the war. This has its great significance, and the cooperative movement has its special effectiveness in this regard. We should also ensure that products have reasonable consumption and reasonable distribution. This is the purpose of establishing cooperatives and the greatest mission of cooperatives. The government is currently planning to promote the production increase movement, and the allied countries will also provide great assistance. It is hoped that you will build on the existing foundation and seek enrichment to assist in the development of production increase work, so that the two major goals of changing people's livelihood and contributing strength to the completion of the war can be implemented simultaneously. We should examine the current situation. In cities, we must eliminate the toxins of Anglo-American thought and the toxins of compradorism. In rural areas, we must eliminate the dross of feudal thought and the pernicious influence of communism. The toxins of thought in cities are not listed here. In terms of rural feudal thought, the ancients said, "Those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their strength are governed by others." Today, feudal thought has become a thing of the past. The state and society's evaluation of "labor" is no longer the same as before. We must make every citizen a laborer of the state and the nation, and this is worthy of being called a new citizen. This meaning is even easier to understand under the wartime system. We should deeply understand the impropriety of our unearned gains. Only by laboring can we enjoy its use. Therefore, the new citizen movement not only focuses on the spirit of training in the practice of labor service. It is hoped that you will work hard to promote the spirit of the era of labor and cleanse it. Urban youth, especially rural youth, the dross of past feudal thought, in terms of the pernicious influence of communism, has always used [ ] people to set fires as its means. Since the 16th year of the Republic of China, rural areas have been ruined and society has been uneasy. Until recently, although it has sometimes changed its style, its deceit of farmers, exploitation of farmers, and violent acts of sacrificing farmers have not diminished slightly. The fundamental policy of the cooperative movement is to seek the revitalization of rural areas, the stability of farmers' lives, and upward mobility. I am convinced that you have long been deeply disgusted with the destruction of the people's strength by the communists and are determined to bear the great mission of fundamentally destroying the toxins of communism. To implement the above items, we must first awaken ordinary farmers, especially rural youth, subject them to strict organization, subject them to strict training, enable them to work hard to increase production, enable them to increase production and advance technology, and enable them to engage in a decisive battle with feudal ideas and communist thugs. It is hoped that you will cooperate in the cooperative movement and the youth organization and training work in rural areas. The proposals you have made at this conference have concrete and perfect plans for increasing production, improving rural society, promoting the new citizen movement, and the youth organization and training work in rural areas. I am very impressed. This conference will be able to achieve satisfactory results, which can be predicted. It is hoped that after the conference, we will work together with one heart and one mind to implement it.</p>

<h3>Focus of Eastern Front Warfare Shifts to the Nevell Area; Fierce Battles Continue in Central and Southern Sectors</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to Huitong News Agency: The focus of operations on the Eastern Front in the past 24 hours has shifted to the Navell area. The intensity of the war in this area has greatly increased. Soviet troops have launched attacks from the west and north of the city, and fierce battles are currently underway. German troops are putting up strong resistance. The fighting near Leningrad has gradually intensified. Although Soviet troops broke through German positions in several places on Thursday, they were quickly recaptured by German counterattacks. The fighting in the Lauhisch region on the Arctic Front has also resumed. It is reported that fierce battles have been ongoing for several days in the area between Lipez and Krechev. On Thursday, Soviet troops west of Krechev attacked under the cover of smoke, but were repelled. Soviet troops near Schlopeen once penetrated deeply, but German troops drove them back during a counterattack and restored the original front lines. Soviet troops between Prilebo and Bessa have also launched repeated attacks, but were blocked by German troops. Fierce battles are currently taking place four kilometers north of Kirovograd.</p>

<h3>Beijing-Tianjin Youth Launch Anti-Dancing, Anti-Drug, and Anti-Gambling Campaign</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - With the Great East Asia War approaching its decisive stage and the foundation for inevitable victory already laid on the front lines, the question of how the people of our country should endure hardship, practice thrift, and increase production in order to contribute to the Great East Asia War is paramount. However, upon examining the domestic situation, there are still some who are deluded, indulging in sensual pleasures, and wasting away in dance halls, smoking rooms, or gambling dens. This not only contributes to the soaring prices and public unrest, but also affects the morale of the people during wartime. Surveying this dark phenomenon, the youth of the capital city, motivated by a sense of justice, and in order to practice wartime living and embody the spirit of the Youth General Mobilization Movement, voluntarily gathered over a thousand youth from various schools at the Youth Hall on the 17th. They resolved to strictly implement the bans on smoking, dancing, and gambling, and issued declarations, protest petitions, slogans, and other materials. They immediately went to various dance halls and opium dens to persuade and educate, hoping that those who were addicted to sensual pleasures, song, dance, and harmful dens would suddenly awaken.</p>
<h3>The Collapse of the Enemy's General Counteroffensive: A Dialogue Between Colonel Kurihara, Head of the Naval Press Section of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, and Colonel Matsumura, Head of the Army Press Section</h3>
<p>Colonel Matsumura:</p>
<p>Yes. For example, the slap in the face from Bougainville, and the announcement of the losses in Hawaii a year later, are completely different from our approach. Another difference between Japan and the United States is that the enemy often uses numbers for propaganda. For example, 125,000 aircraft, iron production this and that, desperately using numbers to demonstrate their strength. However, according to information received from the other side, their figures often contain discrepancies, so there are many points that cannot be believed. In short, the American method is to conceal unfavorable things from the people.</p>
<p>As for their post-war plans, they are secretly based on the premise of victory. As for the actual situation of the war, Japan never publicizes its own military operations, but when they take action, they always boast and shout about counteroffensives one or two days beforehand. For example, in the Gilbert Islands and other battles, Nimitz indicated that he was paying attention to the Central Pacific before launching military operations. Seeing this situation where propaganda precedes the war, one cannot help but feel that they are fighting for the sake of propaganda. American propaganda has reached this extent!</p>
<p>This war is a war between familialism and individualism. The longer the war drags on, the more tragic the situation becomes, and doesn't the familialistic country demonstrate its strength? The people of Japan must be clearly aware of this strength of Japan – the strength of the people and the strength of the family system.</p>
<p>Colonel Kurihara:</p>
<p>I think that today, with enterprise consolidation progressing steadily, aircraft are certainly important, but the production of other things is also not being relaxed. Everyone is working hard in their respective positions, and that is the way to victory.</p>
<p>Colonel Matsumura:</p>
<p>It would be terrible if a hundred million people were not deployed for battle early on! Therefore, problems that arise during enterprise consolidation and other processes should be resolved as quickly as possible. If a hundred million people are deployed for battle in their respective positions, not focusing on theory, but on practical matters, and working diligently and conscientiously, then we can unleash our full strength and produce results.</p>
<h3>The Gathering of Total Strength</h3>
<p>Colonel Kurihara: How about it? Let's draw a conclusion.</p>
<p>Colonel Matsumura:</p>
<p>This war is a war unlike any other in the history of warfare. Previous wars either took place in Europe, or in China, Manchuria, or North America, all with localized regions as battlefields. But this war spans the vast Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, with the entire world as the battlefield. And on this huge battlefield, the strong countries are divided into two camps, the Axis and the Allies. This is indeed the greatest war in human history. Furthermore, the way the war is being conducted is different from the past. In the past, wars mainly relied on the military and the money to support the war. But this war has gone a step further than the so-called military-industrial mobilization war during the First World War. It can be said to be a war of total reorganization. In order to enable peacetime enterprises to produce aircraft, warships, and artillery, enterprises are consolidated and the entire industry is transformed into a military industry. The national organization itself is also adapted to the war. Total strength is unleashed on this reorganized organization, and the war is carried out, evolving to a stage where there is no clear distinction between the front lines and the rear.</p>
<p>From the perspective of military strength, Napoleon used only 445,000 men when he invaded Moscow. Compared with the situation today, where ten million men are mobilized, the difference is huge. From the perspective of the consumption of military equipment, ammunition, aircraft, submarines, and other weapons, the amount of consumption is also very large.</p>
<p>Recently, the darling of modern war weapons, the aircraft, has become the protagonist of the war. In the seas and islands where Japan is waging war, aircraft are demonstrating their power. As for the German-Soviet front, tanks are also crisscrossing and demonstrating their prowess in such large-scale land battles. Therefore, aircraft and tanks have become the greatest darlings of weapons today. Due to this relationship, the consumption and production of scientific weapons have both increased greatly, so factories have also become a major issue.</p>
<p>After the end of the First World War, aircraft developed, and therefore there were many theories about short-term wars in the future. Kaiser Wilhelm also predicted that the wars after the First World War could be ended within 48 hours due to the development of aircraft. However, contrary to this prediction, the Second World War has a tendency to be prolonged due to the development of aircraft. Without aircraft after the resounding victory at Pearl Harbor, perhaps that battle could have determined the outcome of this war. However, because hundreds of aircraft can be produced every day, no matter how many aircraft are shot down, the war still cannot be resolved quickly today.</p>
<p>In small areas such as Poland and France, blitzkriegs were implemented early on and were all successful. However, when the war zone is wider, due to the power range and supply relations of the air bases, the larger the combat area, the more difficult it is to resolve the war simply. Thus, the war itself has a tendency to become a long-term war. Recently, the phrase "supply war" is often mentioned. This is probably because the battlefield is too far from the home country or base, so more ships, more soldiers, and more aircraft are needed. Because the distance is far, the existing military force tends to weaken when viewed as a whole. On this point, the war also has a tendency to be difficult to end early. Furthermore, because the consumption of materials is very large, so thinking from the opposite side, the loss of territory is not a problem, but the large consumption of materials is the key to the war. The so-called war of attrition is to inflict a great blow on the enemy and make them suffer the horrors of war, so it is not necessary to capture vast lands to achieve the war's purpose. This is the tendency today. In any case, the people must unite and strive to engage in total war. Moreover, changing the organization within can increase strength. If everything is concentrated for the purpose of war, it can become a very advanced thing. Continuing to engage in a war where it is difficult to determine victory or defeat is unavoidable.</p>
<p>I think that in modern warfare, the most important thing is to raise total strength. In its strength, it includes spiritual strength and material strength. This spiritual strength can not only be infinitely developed, but also the person who pilots the aircraft is a person, and the person who manufactures the aircraft is also a person. I think it is most important to maximize this spiritual strength. From this, material strength can also be improved. The foundation for increasing aircraft production is mankind. Relying on the efforts of mankind, as you just said, it is possible to gradually open up a narrow path. In short, it is necessary to improve combat power by waiting for spiritual and material matters to improve. Ranke's theory of great powers says: "A country's prestige abroad is not obtained casually, but is gradually built up by strength, so it is necessary to concentrate various forces." I think the so-called victor is the one who concentrates and unleashes the country's various forces to the highest degree. The longer the war drags on, the more strength increases, and the one who holds the winning ticket can be controlled, so the cultivation of this strength is the most important thing.</p>
<p>Colonel Kurihara:</p>
<p>From the perspective of naval warfare, the world's three major naval powers, Japan, the United States, and Britain, are now divided into two camps, using the world's seven oceans as a large stage, and putting on a full-scale martial arts performance. Therefore, it is a magnificent war unseen in the history of warfare to date. As I said at the beginning, the new phenomenon that has occurred in this naval warfare is that in naval warfare before today, the core of the battleship fleet was other ships, which were called auxiliary troops. For example, the Battle of Jutland in the previous war, the Battle of the Auckland Islands, or other naval battles, all used battleships as the center of the war. But in this war, aircraft exerted their extraordinary power, showing a great power that we could not have imagined. Even the majestic and huge battleships, which have been called the kings of the sea, cannot withstand the torpedoes and bombs of aircraft and sink. This has been confirmed in many subsequent naval and air battles since the naval battles off Hawaii and Malaya. Moreover, the construction of battleships and the like takes a long time, but aircraft can be produced in tens or hundreds of units every day. Therefore, even if many enemy battleships are sunk, the war still cannot be ended.</p>
<p>As you just said, if it were in the past, the United States Pacific Fleet would have been half paralyzed by the attack on Hawaii, and the war could have been declared over. But in this war, aircraft have become the main players on the war stage, and are even more important than battleships, and can be produced in large quantities. As a result, merely sinking battleships still cannot grasp the decisive power of the war. Although the United States has lost many battleships, it still intends to launch a major counteroffensive centered on aircraft, which shows this clearly.</p>
<p>As a result, when air supremacy is seized by relying on the power of aircraft, naval supremacy is also 80-90% in hand. Moreover, the ocean is different from land, there are no air-raid shelters to hide in, and there is nothing to shield against aircraft attacks.</p>
<p>I think that aircraft are no different from long-range artillery, or they can be said to be long-range torpedoes, and the range of the aircraft is its range. When enemy ships enter its range, they can become the target of aircraft attacks. Therefore, today's naval battles are different from the past, and there are often opportunities to launch fierce battles. In other words, they are rich in mobility.</p>
<p>During the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese fleet was in Sasebo and the Russian fleet was in Lushun. The two sides approached for certain strategic purposes. But when did the naval battle occur? It was when the two sides entered the range of the artillery, that is, when they sailed within an extremely close distance of 10,000 meters or 20,000 meters.</p>
<p>Now, as long as enemy ships invade the long "range" of the aircraft, or if it is known that the enemy has a base somewhere, an attack can be launched day and night whenever there is an opportunity. Therefore, in today's war, not to mention land battles, the opportunities for naval battles to occur are also very numerous in the vast ocean. As a result, the so-called large consumption arises, and thus it becomes a war of attrition. The character of needing to fight with the total strength of the entire country is even stronger. Therefore, I hope that the people recognize this point and devote all their efforts to producing aircraft and strengthening combat power.

<h3>1944: Predictions for the Future</h3>
<p>Nations have prophecies, dating back far before the Qin and Han dynasties. The Zhou dynasty was predicted to last for thirty generations and eight hundred years, and throughout the Zhou dynasty, the prophecies proved accurate. Confucius compiled the Book of Documents, and Qin built palaces, knowing that Qin would come after Zhou. In general, the rise and fall of the future are within cycles. National fortune is so, and personal destiny is also so. Although there is no fixed destiny in life's ups and downs, only philosophers can exhaust the principles of how long or short it will last. Today's great scholar, Mr. Zhen Zuobi, has profound philosophy and is trusted both domestically and abroad. He regularly uses his techniques to resolve doubts for people, and his predictions are accurate. Mr. Zhen's program includes a "Yearly Prediction" service, which can predict the future destiny of individuals from all walks of life in 1944 ("Jia Shen"). If you want to know your financial luck and future development next year, please visit Mr. Zhen Zuobi's office at 486 Nanjing Road, Women's Bank Building, telephone 96657.</p>
<h3>Coal Briquette Panic Intensifies Daily; Rationing by Headcount Hopes for Early Implementation</h3>
<p>The supply of coal briquettes in this city is becoming increasingly serious. Not only are retail stores lacking goods, but also factories are successively ceasing production, reportedly due to the depletion of raw materials. Although some factories are still operating and shipping goods, it is ultimately insufficient to meet market demand, leading to an increasingly rampant black market trade. There is a unanimous hope that the authorities will take immediate measures to thoroughly improve the coal briquette supply situation and implement a rationing system by headcount as soon as possible to meet urgent needs. Regarding coal for boiled water shops, the Greater China Allied Coal Company in this city has been approved by the authorities to ration 200 tons of Shandong Grade 2 lump coal and 99 tons of Shandong Grade 2 coal powder, totaling 299 tons, to 567 boiled water shops, with each household receiving about half a ton. The distribution is assigned to five companies: Yi Tai Xing, Da Chang, Yi Hao, Jian Hua, and Jun Chang.</p>
<p>Registration of Fuel for Various Industries</p>
<p>The First District Public Office issued a notice yesterday for the registration of large quantities of bituminous and anthracite coal needed by various industrial and commercial enterprises. All industrial and commercial users who need large quantities of anthracite or bituminous coal, excluding coal briquettes, should obtain a special registration application form from Office No. 624, Economic Affairs Department of this office at 109 Jiangxi Road before December 23rd of this year and submit it for registration. This notice does not apply to Japanese residents and users who receive fuel coal distributed by the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy. The authorities' distribution of special fuels for industrial and commercial enterprises this time is aimed at preventing hoarding, cracking down on black market transactions, and ensuring that various industries obtain sufficient fuel on schedule. Therefore, when filling out the application form, all industries must strive to be accurate in order to be reviewed.</p>
<h3>The 9th of Each Month Next Year Designated as Air Defense Day; Training to Be Implemented Under the Leadership of the Authorities</h3>
<p>According to information obtained yesterday by a reporter from the Times from the Air Defense Warning Section of the First Police Bureau, in order to improve the air defense efficiency of this city, it has been decided that starting next year, the 9th of each month will be designated as "Air Defense Day". The Civil Air Defense Headquarters will universally implement air defense training, including air defense drills, training lectures, and various practical experiments with items and equipment. During the "Air Defense Day" exercises, air defense warning personnel will participate each time. As for the implementation of various programs, such as models of enemy aircraft and the actions that should be taken during air raid shelters, a list will be made available for the public to consult. On the other hand, the authorities will test the public's air defense potential at any time, and teach them how to use new air defense equipment and methods, and conduct individual or collective experiments on the 9th of each month.</p>

<h3>City Propaganda Department Convenes Fifth Regular Press Conference to Discuss Municipal and Livelihood Issues</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: The City Propaganda Department convened its fifth regular press conference at 3:00 PM yesterday in the City Hall Auditorium. Over thirty representatives from various newspapers, news agencies, and government organizations attended. The questions raised by the newspaper reporters and the responses from the representatives of various agencies are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Switching Road Sign Dates</p>
<p>(Ping Bao asks) The replacement of new street nameplates in districts 1 and 8 of this city was originally scheduled to begin at the beginning of this month, but it has been delayed. Has the authorities determined a definite date for the replacement of these new street nameplates? And are there any plans to promote the adoption of the new street names? (Public Works Bureau answers) Regarding the replacement of the new street nameplates, it was originally planned to begin at the beginning of this month. However, due to the metal salvage campaign, the type of material to be used for the street nameplates and the timing of the replacement are still under consideration.</p>
<p>Financial Status of the Two Districts</p>
<p>(New China Daily asks) Since the recovery of the concessions and the unification of municipal administration, has there been any significant progress in the financial and taxation affairs of districts 1 and 8? Has the financial situation improved? (Finance Bureau answers) Since the recovery of the concessions, the municipal administration of this city has been unified. Regarding the question of whether there has been progress in financial and taxation matters, in the eighth district, because the Director of Finance is concurrently the Director of this Bureau, the supervision and command are more flexible, and tax revenue has made significant progress, now increasing to about 18 million. As for the first district, no report has been submitted to the Bureau, so detailed information cannot be provided.</p>
<p>Merger Date of the Two Districts</p>
<p>(New China Daily asks) Regarding the beginning of the recovery of the concessions in this city, Mayor Chen once stated that the merger of districts 1 and 8 could be implemented in early February of the 32nd year [1943], and later stated that it might be advanced to New Year's Day of the 33rd year [1944]. To what extent has this plan progressed as of recently? (Secretariat answers) Regarding the merger of the first and eighth district public offices in this city, it can be implemented around early February of next year [1944]. All merger details are being actively studied.</p>
<p>Improving Rice Rationing</p>
<p>(New China Daily asks) The police authorities in this city have repeatedly stated that they strictly prohibit the sale of rice and grain on the black market, but the household rice ration is insufficient for consumption. Does the authorities have any good way to increase the rationed grain so that citizens do not have to buy black market rice, and the black market will disappear by itself? (Central News Agency asks) Since the abolition of the Rice and Grain Joint Operations and the establishment of the Rice and Grain Control Association, the general public has had high expectations. It is rumored that the household rice ration will be increased soon. However, it has been three months, and not only has the household rice ration not been increased, but it has also been reduced from two sheng [升, about 2 liters] to one sheng [升, about 1 liter], and there have been three postponements. These three rice tickets have been announced by the authorities to be exchanged for cooking oil. How will these remaining three rations of rice be handled? Moreover, a ration of one sheng [升, about 1 liter] of rice and one jin [斤, about 0.5 kg] of flour per person every ten days is definitely not enough, so people have to resort to the black market, but black market rice is prohibited by the authorities. Now that the new Director of the Food Bureau has taken office, will he work with the Rice Control Association to thoroughly solve the problem of people's food? The two questions are deferred because the representative of the Food Bureau is not present.</p>
<p>Citizen Fuel Panic</p>
<p>(Shen Bao, China Daily, New China Daily ask) The fuel problem for citizens is becoming increasingly serious. Coal briquettes are sold at the official price, but coal merchants refuse to sell, claiming they have no stock. The black market price has reached 300 yuan per dan [擔, about 50 kg], and they are only willing to sell by the ton. Citizens of the middle and lower classes who rely on wages for a living will be left without fuel. Does the authorities have a way to alleviate their panic regarding this serious livelihood issue? (Economic Bureau answers) Recently, due to the shortage of coal sources, a panic has occurred in the supply and demand of coal briquettes in this city. This Bureau has consulted with the Economic Bureau of the first district, and rationing can be implemented starting in January. It is currently being actively planned.</p>
<p>Restrictions on Water and Electricity in the Eighth District</p>
<p>(News Daily asks) The Hua Zhong and China Electric Power Companies have announced measures to restrict electricity use, determining the percentage of reduction based on the importance of each industry. The minimum supply of 25 kilowatt-hours per month is still maintained in both Nanjing and Shanghai, which reassures the general public. However, the electricity in the eighth district is supplied by the French Water and Electricity Company, and the details of its restriction measures have not been announced. It is hoped that the company will provide a detailed response to dispel concerns. (Public Utilities Bureau answers) Electricity use in the eighth district was previously restricted. Now, to save even more, the amount of electricity used in the future must not exceed 65% of the highest amount of electricity used in July, August, and September. The penalty measures have been announced previously.</p>
<p>(News Daily asks) Regarding the supply of water, it has also been reported that the eighth district will be restricted and there will be penalties, but no detailed measures have been announced, causing concern among citizens. Moreover, the method of metering water is different from that of electricity. Larger and four-style houses have meters installed for each household, but in general old-style neighborhoods, water has been supplied by the landlord, and there is only one meter for each neighborhood. If there is an excess, the responsibility is unclear. If water is cut off as a penalty, it will affect the drinking water and hygiene of all residents in the neighborhood, which is not a minor matter. Cunning landlords can also take this opportunity to coerce tenants, and there will inevitably be many disputes in the future. The company should give more serious consideration to the penalty of water cut-off and plan a more appropriate and reasonable restriction method. (Public Utilities Bureau answers) Regarding the issue of the eighth district, we are still consulting with the supply agency.</p>

<h3>Division A Football Tournament: Donghua vs. Yi Jing, 10:00 AM Today at Yi Yuan</h3>
<p>In the football league, there is an important and exciting Division A match today. At 10:00 AM, the regular winning team Donghua will face the strong team Yi Jing at Yi Yuan. Although Yi Jing lost to the Portuguese Merchants, they are still a strong team, so this match is sure to be highly attractive. The referee is He Chunhui. Donghua's lineup remains the same. Today, with the momentum of four wins in four games, it will not be difficult to capture Yi Jing in one fell swoop. The opponent's reliance on the goal-scoring ability of the yellow-haired Robert Stoff will meet Donghua's northern general Tan Fuzhen, so he will inevitably be unable to cross the line. Once the yellow hair loses its mobility, Donghua can rest easy. Another Division A match, Portuguese Merchants vs. Jews, will be held at Jiaozhou Park at 3:30 PM. The other eight matches are all Division B and C matches. The schedule for today is recorded below:</p>
<p>Yi Jing - Donghua, Division A, 10:30 AM, Yi Yuan</p>

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>The Future of China's Silk Industry</h3>
<p>In yesterday's article "Restricting Enterprise Capital Increase," it was mentioned that companies and factories should be cautious about excessive expansion of stocks during price increases and stock issuances. This is because short-sighted entrepreneurs often make a common mistake, which is to only care about current profits and not consider the future of the business, ultimately leading to neglecting the fundamentals and pursuing superficial gains. For example, consider China's silk industry. This is a heavy industry that is of great importance to the clothing needs of the Chinese people. If China wants to improve the silk industry and increase production, it must start from the root in various aspects. How easy is that? Can we simply rely on a few so-called silk industry figures who call themselves silk companies and are concerned about the ups and downs of silk stocks and bonds to extravagantly talk about the future of China's silk industry?</p>
<p>Take Allied Japan as an example. Since the cut-off of Japanese raw silk exports during the Greater East Asia War, it has instead established the foundation for a technological revolution in the Japanese silk industry. Currently, the contribution of the Japanese silk industry to enhancing combat power is: 1) contributing to military production, such as the latest invention of "silk-made leather"; 2) contributing to food production, such as using silkworm pupae to make various edible oils, seasonings, and soy sauce; 3) contributing to domestic resources, such as using silk and artificial fibers to make up for the lack of cotton and wool imports, and having raw silk wool substitute technology. These are all glimmers of hope for the future of the Japanese silk industry.</p>
<p>In the past, the quality of Chinese silk was poor. Foreign countries did not want to use it, and the Chinese themselves did not like to use it. As a result, the materials for Chinese people's clothing were almost entirely dependent on foreign洋布洋紗 [western cloth and yarn], and the magnificent silk fabrics used by wealthy families were also imported from foreign countries, which is heartbreaking to say. Now that this type of import has been cut off, it is a golden opportunity for China to develop its silk industry. It is urgent for the government and the people to jointly promote the technological revolution of the Chinese silk industry. Not only must we improve silkworm and silk spinning methods, but we must also make the Chinese silk industry contribute to other aspects, such as military needs and food. Then, the future of China's silk industry will seem limitless!</p>
<h3>Authorities to Conduct Comprehensive Investigation to Enforce Price Controls</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the shortage of coal and electricity restrictions, prices have risen sharply again. According to investigations, a significant number of prices have increased several times over. The authorities are paying close attention to this. This reporter recently learned from relevant sources that the authorities will launch a large-scale enforcement of price controls. Currently, a large number of investigators are being assigned to conduct a comprehensive investigation of various companies and firms throughout the city within the shortest possible time. The main targets of the investigation are: 1) whether prices exceed the limit; 2) whether all displayed goods are priced; 3) whether the goods are placed in a prominent position in the store, and whether there is refusal to sell goods; 4) whether invoices are issued for the sale of goods; 5) whether substandard measuring instruments are used, etc. If necessary, account books may also be inspected. As for industries that genuinely need to adjust prices due to high costs, they must provide sufficient reasons and apply to the authorities. Price changes can only be made after the authorities have investigated and verified the facts. If there is any private price increase, it will be severely punished once discovered.</p>
<h3>Stock Exchange Supervisory Committee Secretly Investigates Stockbrokers</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Shanghai Stock Exchange Supervisory Committee, supervision has been strict in order to achieve a path of safe and sound investment. Recently, due to the large fluctuations in stock prices, the Stock Exchange was again instructed: "The rise and fall of stock market prices are directly and indirectly related to the normal buying and selling of investors and the stability of financial prices. Recently, the stock market prices in the exchange have fluctuated greatly, and there is bound to be unscrupulous merchants engaging in disguised speculation and manipulation to achieve their illegal profit-making purposes, which is worthy of attention. In addition to sending personnel to conduct secret investigations at any time, the exchange should immediately investigate and report the details for verification. If there are any illegal activities, it should also promptly report to this committee and forward it to the government for severe punishment, without indulgence. This order is crucial." It is also heard that the committee has now moved its office to the Central Trust Company Building at 10 Hankou Road, telephone number 18840.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Industry to Shorten Business Hours</h3>
<p>To adapt to the authorities' electricity saving measures, various industries in this city have appropriately reduced their office hours. The business hours of various stores have been shortened by an average of 1-2 hours, and various unnecessary power consumption has been saved. It is heard that the silver and money industry is also considering shortening the current office hours from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>China Raw Hide Company Starts Unified Purchase of Raw Hides</h3>
<p>The "China Raw Hide Company," a new unified institution jointly operated by China and Japan responsible for the unified control and purchase of raw hides in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as the Shanghai and Nanjing special city areas, has completed all preparation work since its establishment. Therefore, it is also preparing to start the unified control and purchase affairs. It is understood that the company has decided on the list of designated merchants in various regions as follows:</p>

<h3>Chinese Stocks Rise First and Then Fall, Yarn Mill Stocks Attract Attention from Various Factions</h3>

<h3>Shandong Association Initiates Reconstruction of the Guild Hall</h3>
<p>The Shandong Association on Simen Road was founded in the 29th year of Guangxu [1903] by Shang Lu Hai, Minister of the Foreign Affairs Department, Wu Zhongyi, Customs Minister, Yao Ting, Shanghai County XXX, and Shandong gentlemen. Lu initially served as the Shanghai 道 [Circuit Intendant], then as the head of Customs, and later as the German envoy. During the Boxer Rebellion, he corresponded with Li Hongzhang to secure a peaceful agreement and then revised the commercial treaties with Sheng Xuanhuai, carefully deliberating. Later, he served as the Minister of the Foreign Affairs Department, making great contributions. The Guild Hall was completed in the 32nd year [1906], containing the Dacheng Pavilion, the Zhidao Hall, the Guan Di Temple, and the Tian Hou Palace. The architecture is in palace style, with carved beams and painted pillars, which is extremely magnificent. There is a stage inside, which is convenient for entertainment and also facilitates theatrical performances. The plaques were mostly written by Cao Hongxun, Governor of Shaanxi, and Wang XX Peng, Director of Shandong Education (both were Shandong XXX No. 1 scholars). Wu Peifu also has a plaque. There are many calligraphy works by famous people in the corridors. The stone lions in front of the hall were moved from Shengze, Wujiang. Later, a villa was built in Nanshi and the Qilu Primary School.</p>
<p>The Guild Hall is large in scale and antique in style, and is one of the famous attractions in Shanghai. The Honorary Chairman of the Association, Su Chengde, XX Tiankai, and the Chairman of the Board, Cui Jingsan, etc., initiated the reconstruction of the Guild Hall and invited famous actors from the city to perform charity performances at the Tianchan Stage on the 22nd and 23rd. The Association also scheduled a grand New Year's Day gathering on the Gregorian calendar, with the school holding a progress exhibition and a games fair, welcoming all fellow villagers to participate. After the New Year, it will also cooperate with the Confucius Learning Association to hold regular lectures.</p>
<p>San Wu University Re-establishment Campaign</p>

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>The mindset of "a true man does not open," since being influenced by those gymnastics, has become even stronger. Climbing the iron bars every day, unknowingly, the horizontal bar, hanging upside down, were also easily mastered. Whatever other students could do, he could do as well. These were all rewards of hard work, the crystallization of ambition. Even in his young heart, he deeply felt the power of confidence and the joy of conquering external things.</p>
<p>(I am also a man who cannot yield to others.)</p>
<p>Thinking this way, his unyielding heart also grew stronger. Thus, Makoto suddenly became interested in iron bars and horizontal bars, and even after school, he would entice Mu Si and Takao to run to the playground.</p>
<p>"Makoto, can you do a wind wheel?"</p>
<p>Takao asked this way.</p>
<p>The wind wheel was also extremely rare among children. However, the physical education teacher would sometimes demonstrate it to the students.</p>
<p>"I can," Makoto blurted out unintentionally.</p>
<p>Having said it, he had to do it. He had previously practiced it secretly, failing half the time and succeeding half the time. He used all the possible reaction force and turned his body violently.</p>
<p>(Finally succeeded!)</p>
<p>Just as he was relieved, he felt vaguely dizzy. Because it was a dangerous move, he only turned once and jumped onto the sandy ground. He thought he had jumped properly, but the bone in his left shoulder clicked.</p>
<p>He didn't feel anything at the time, but on the way home, his left hand became unfree. Moreover, it started to hurt in the evening, and he couldn't sleep at all in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>"Why do such dangerous games?"</p>
<p>His mother, who never even raised an eyebrow at her children's minor illnesses from catching a cold, was now quite stern because this child was in danger of becoming disabled in the future. And she applied a wet towel to Makoto's shoulder all night.</p>
<p>The next morning, she took him to the doctor for a diagnosis, and it was said that the joint was dislocated. When the doctor pointed at it, it would hurt so much that he would jump up, but the doctor ruthlessly applied the medicine and wrapped it tightly with a medicated cloth. Makoto shifted his gaze to the white wall of the doctor's office, gritting his teeth and enduring it. This was not only his usual defiance. (Mom is by my side!) He couldn't bear to worry his mother because of his carelessness and had to show as little pain as possible.</p>
<p>From that day on, Makoto took a week off from school. Fortunately, he recovered well and was no longer in much pain, so he didn't have to tell his mother useless lies.</p>
<p>"I'll get better on my own later."</p>
<p>He deliberately shrugged his shoulders and went to school.</p>
<h3>A Hospital on Luoyang Road: A Visit to Shanghai Nanyang Hospital</h3>
<p>Perfected Treatment Equipment</p>
<p>Although the renovated hospital building is not entirely satisfactory in terms of medical standards, it can already be considered first-class compared to the general major hospitals in Shanghai. Look, the general affairs office, the workshop, and even the treatment rooms of various departments, the chemical laboratories, are so rationally distributed in each series of wards. Almost every patient is surrounded by a group of doctors, nurses, and various treatment tools. Almost every patient's breath and pulse are carefully cared for. The first floor, the second floor, and even the third floor, each floor and even each group of wards constitute a treatment and care system, and close connections are maintained between the systems. Just from the allocation and deployment of rooms in the hospital building, it can be seen how scientific, planned, and organized this major hospital is. If I were a patient's relative visiting, seeing such meticulous arrangements, I could put my mind at ease and no longer worry about the patient.</p>
<p>In the three-story building, there are a total of eighty wards and two hundred beds (including fifty beds for accompanying patients). More than 40% of these are beds for the poor. Look at the rooms for the poor. Each room has four to five beds. The pediatric ward for poor children accommodates seven or eight people per room. All are iron beds with clean white bedding, simple, clean, and quiet, without the "cabin" feeling of general third-class wards. From this, one can see how much the hospital cares for poor patients, not out of hypocrisy or charity, but based on the service ethics of universal love and mutual assistance.</p>
<p>In order to adapt to the practical situation of the current society and the psychology of the general middle-class citizens, Nanyang Hospital has also specially designated a part of the rooms in the wards as "second-class" and "first-class" wards. In terms of form and internal arrangement, they are naturally more exquisite. Look, each second-class ward has only one bed, a small table, and some potted plants decorating the window. How quiet it is! Patients can quietly forget the bustling society and all their worries!</p>
<p>The layout of the first-class ward is even more exquisite. It has a bathroom, a radiator in winter, a fan in summer, and a specially equipped bed for the patient's companion. It looks like a special-class cabin on a luxurious cruise ship such as the President or Queen, with warmth and comfort in the quiet and cleanliness.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the modern medical equipment! First of all, there is the physiotherapy department full of mechanization and technological气息, quietly displaying X-ray fluoroscopy and imaging equipment, X-ray treatment, ultra-short wave, diathermy treatment machine, ultraviolet and sun lamps, etc. Try to turn on the switch, and in the darkness, a surprisingly strong light shines. What a great scientific and mechanical power!</p>
