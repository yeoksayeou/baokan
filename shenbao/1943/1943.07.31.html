<h3>從接收上海租界說到協力完遂大東亞戰爭</h3>
<p>期待着的光榮的一天，百年來爲中華民族時時期待着的光榮的一天，中華民國歷史乃至東亞民族解放史上光榮的一天，終於來臨了！從今天起，上海回復爲本國的領土，從今天起，上海四百多萬同胞享受本國政府的保護，從今天起，中華民國領土之內再沒有恥辱與罪惡的「國內之國」－－租界，從今天起，東亞民族互愛互助共存共榮的理論得到事實的證明，我們慶幸今天，我們的子孫也將永遠慶幸這歷史上光榮的一天。</p>
<p>爲着廢除不平等條約，爭回租界的領土主權，我們曾經有過半世紀以上的　鬥，但今日，光榮的結果，上海租界的接收，却是由友邦日本爲實現對華新政策而實現了，在友邦和東亞各民族的立塲，這是互助共榮的光輝的事實。因此，我們在慶祝這光榮日子之際，每一個中國人都要深自勉旃，要以爭取收回租界應有的犧牲奮鬥移作接收租界後種種方面的努力。否則，我們便對不起自己，對不起國家，對不起友邦；如果我們能移爭回租界之力於接收後的種種事業，那麽，未來的成就，必有足以更加爲國家民族及東亞歷史增光者，這是我們今日最基本的任務。</p>
<p>如何移爭取收回租界之犧牲奮鬥以作接收後之種種努力呢？針對着上海的地位及其實際情形，針對着世界大局和中國今日的當務之急，我們認爲，今後新生上海的努力方向，已經非常明顯地展現於我們面前：　從上海本身說，百年來在帝國主義者的經營之下，它已成爲全國最大的經濟中心和文化之都，同時因爲畸形的發展而成爲中國經濟與文化正常發展的最大桎梏。從今以後，我們一方面要澈底肅淸上海對於全國經濟與文化正常發展的不良與不純因素，一方面使由畸形改變正常，形成全國經濟與文化復興的中心區域。　從上海對全國的地位說，依據其歷史上與地理上的諸特殊條件，它必須逐漸成爲全國政治上經濟上乃至文化上的模範區，由新生上海政治建設經濟建設及文化建設的示範作用，以推進參戰中國全區的示範作用，更進而推及於全國。　從上海對友邦與對東亞的地位說，以上海日僑人數在全國日僑比率之巨大，新生上海必須成爲中日人民合作相處的模範區，使全國乃至全東亞，都以上海中日人民之合作爲模範面向大東亞共榮圈建設事業邁進。</p>
<p>新生上海之建設的努力，在上述爲全國及全東亞示範的重大意義下，應該向如何最急要的具體事業開始？我們老百姓不講高深的政治理論，也不作過於理想的期待，我們所迫急要求其實現的，是以下數端。</p>
<p>首先，在老百姓方面，當租界二字成爲歷史名詞以後，對於新生上海的最高希望，只有四個大字：「安居樂業」，更具體的說，便是希望實現「抑平物價」及「充裕民食」二點。目前上海人民生活最感威脅的，就是糧食恐慌與物價無止境的狂漲，租界收回以後，當局可以依照計劃推行新政，消滅國民經濟的危機而保障最大多數人民的生活。同時，我們還應鄭重指出，也只有先就民食與物價方面滿足人民要求之後，使人民安居樂業之後，才談得到今後新生上海一切建設事業的推進。</p>
<p>其次，人民所要求的是新生上海政治的修明。而且，要做到上述改善民主一點，要消除一切經濟上之危機，也必須先做到「政治修明」。要做到「政治修明」，就得先從下述幾件事開始：　提高警　與公務人員的待遇，尤其要注意是眞正的切實的「提高」，保障其生活，使在服務中毫無後顧之慮及爲生活而分心。　加强保甲組織，提高一般市民自治的能力，並進而促進一切人民自治事業。在這兩點實現之後，官民協力，才能進求「政治修明」。</p>
<p>第三，我們還要特別提出爭取人民自發協力之絕對的重要性。以上經濟與政治兩方面的要求，如果得不到人民自動的協力，都不能期待有美滿的結果。要求人民自發協力，自在民意機關之建立，前間常局已有扶助創立眞正民意機關的决心，這是値得人民欣　的事，希望在一二月後，即能有事實表現。尤盼各界先進，重視此事。我們中國人民，自古以來，君子過重禮讓，以問政爲恥，潔身遠避，賢德退而小人進，常致造成政局黑暗。甚望當仁不讓，出來共負鉅艱。</p>
<p>上海租界之接收，適在國際大局空前重大之時，實具有特別重大的意義。因此，我們上述幾項要求，完全是爲了實現新生上海之建設，使爲全國與全東亞的模範。日本爲了在東亞民族共存共榮事業示範而交還租界，我們就必須爲協力日本完遂大東亞戰爭而加倍努力於新生上海的種種事業。我們在今天盛大的慶祝中，特別要強調指出，大東亞戰爭之完遂，共榮圈建設之成功，固然基於軸心國之團結，基於東亞軸心國之團結，但尤在於東亞各民族間之團結與合作。可是從中國目前的現狀來看，如何配談協力與合作？只有參戰中國區內政治健全與經濟發展，先把自己堅强起來，才能談到協力作戰，而新生上海政治經濟之上述努力，實爲參戰中國政治健全經濟發展的模範與推動力，爲此，我們更不能不要求全國上下在慶祝之中，認淸自己的地位，担負自己的任務。加倍努力，向建設新上海協力大東亞戰爭邁進。</p>
<p>光榮的一天總於來臨，我們要犧牲奮鬥爭取最後勝利的明天！</p>

<h3>西西里上空　軸心空軍活躍　陸上無大規模戰爭</h3>
<p>柏林三十一日中央社電　西西里島之戰爭，近因英第八軍在在喀太尼亞，已陷於苦悶中，同時巴雷爾摩市車方之美第七軍、自佔領捷夫爾後，遭軸心軍之痛擊，已感進退維谷，故已無大規模之戰事，且因軸心空軍大肆活躍，反軸心軍之行動，更爲遲滯。茲據復國新聞社前綫特派員訊，西西里島方面，地上戰事，刻仍無大變化，惟軸心空軍，已日鑒活躍。二士九日，曾在吉拉港方面水域，炸沉敵八千　運輪船一艘，並痛創吉拉港之敵空軍根據地，炸毀停於地上之飛機多架。此外復轟擊停泊於與古　塔灣中之敵船團，　創貴船三艘，計一萬四千噸。又軸心機別動隊，曾長驅空與北非之比塞大港，予以重創。目前西西里島之地上戰鬥，僅爲砲戰，與偵察戰中。北東三方面反軸心軍作戰，悉遭重創。</p>
<h3>奧勒爾北側　蘇攻勢受挫</h3>
<p>柏林三十一日中央社電　德國新聞社東綫隨軍記者哈瑪上校稱，庫班橋頭米烏斯與中部唐納資等各路，以及貝爾哥洛特區之戰事，似已更趨活躍，但東綫夏季大戰之中心，仍在奧勒爾灣，蘇軍雖繼續調遣生力軍，與捷　補充之坦克軍與步兵隊加入作戰，企圖獲得軍略上之若干成功，但德軍固守陣地，屹然不動，而續以最嚴重之損失，加諸蘇軍，在此戰鬥中，蘇軍於星期四日損失坦克車一百零五輛，其中九十九輛，係在奧勒爾地區內被擊毀者，自七月五日以來，蘇軍坦克車之損失，總數已超過七千輛，星期四日蘇軍向奧勒爾灣之南側進攻，大半由步兵作戰，但此等攻擊，均在德軍猛烈之防禦砲火前，終於崩潰。蘇軍坦克車駛近德軍陣綫時均站隊成羣，前後啣接，一如前數次之情形，其主要之目的，在於挿入奧勒爾凸出部之北側。蘇軍連續以坦克車西大隊共約二百輛，先後出動，但在劇烈而時起時落之戰鬥中，被擊退，蘇軍遭受人力與物質之重大損失，穿入德軍陣綫若干據點之蘇軍坦克車隊，爲後備兵所殲滅，德軍地上部隊，獲得斯多加飛機與軍用機有效之支助，各該機空擊敵軍集中處，與展開處，以炸彈及目標準確之機　槍火，擊潰敵步兵隊。德空軍一隊，炸毀蘇軍坦克車十八輛，德軍用機空擊蘇軍之砲位，使敵方重榴彈砲二十三　寂然無聲。德軍在庫班橋頭以及阿索夫海與貝爾哥洛特之間，實行强有力之反攻，結果使德軍陣地獲得不少改進，敵戰俘多名，與大批戰具，落入德軍手中。蘇軍在列寧格勒區以大砲與飛機爲掩護，屢次向德軍陣地發動攻擊，但均被擊退，損失重大。</p>
<h3>英美蘇對中立國　提出警吿</h3>
<p>里斯本三十一日中央社電　據倫敦來電稱，歐洲各中立國及阿根廷，頃接英國之通知警吿，渠單對交戰國之領袖人物，勿予以任何協助，據稱，英國將視此種協助乃破壞反軸心國作戰之主義之行動。路透社之外交訪員謂，英國通知之措詞，實與蘇聯致瑞典及土耳其之通知相同，並謂英國政府現正取同一步驟，以昨日羅斯福總統所發表之主題之文吿，致送各中立國。</p>
<h3>英內閣召開　緊急會議</h3>
<p>瑞典　城三十一日中央社電　據倫敦電，英政府曾於三十日上午零時卅分，召開緊急閣議，歷二小時之久，會議內容不明，據謂此次閣議，極爲突然，多數閣僚，均於夢中被喚此出席云。</p>
<h3>關於日僑課稅條約事　日大使館發表談話</h3>
<p>中央社京訊　日本駐華大使錧當局七月三十一日就在華日本臣民關於實施課稅關係條約之注意事項，發表談話如次：</p>
<p>依據中日間所締結「在華日本臣民課稅條約」此爲自西暦一八四二年南京條約及一八四三年五日通商協定成立以來，日本撤廢東縛中國主權之治外法權的第一步，先承認中國方面之課稅權，援助中國民國之自主的發展，共同向解放大東亞，建設東新秩序之途邁進，關於本條約之規定，日本居留民所應注意之事項如次，希日本居留民對照所發表之條約，附屬協定，及了解事項加以注意。</p>
<p>（一）服從中華民國課稅法令：依據本條約誨一條及第二條規定，日本臣民自本年八月一日以後，在中華民國領域內應完全服從中國之課稅法令，法人並然。但日本臣民，在任何塲合之下，當然不可比中華民國國民受有不利益之待遇。條約第一條第二條本條約之規定，不僅以中華民國之規狀爲目標，並以稅制之事備及由於國府方面積極努力完成各種設施之將來爲目標。日本方面，對於本條約第一條之規定，希望早日得能適用，但中華民國之現狀，倘未達到此種時期，實行時有某種程度之限制，故有「暫定措置」了解事項第一及第二項之規定。</p>
<p>（二）關於法令範圍及適用狀態之通吿：（甲）通吿之意義：依據條約第一條之規定，日本臣民應服從中華民國法令之範圍及適用之狀態，由國府外交部部長通吿日本駐華大使館（附屬協定第一條），依據此項正式之通吿，具體確定日本臣民應服從之稅法。換言之，無通吿，即無服務之義務。（乙）通吿之公布：該通吿之內容，除由日本之官報中華民國政府公報公佈外，並由各地之領事館，依據條約之規定，關於納稅應有必要之指示，希望日本居留民注意該通吿及指示，而不得誤解（附屬協定第五條）。又通吿與實際上交付開始之間，應保留猶豫之時間。（丙）通吿之順序與時期，中華民國政府對日本駐華大使應通吿之稅權，稅法以及共實行之狀態，目下正在硏究中，永遠存在，業於開始時說明。日本國民站在大局的立塲上，深望能對中國方面之要求，進而納稅，且予以協力，更具體言之，例如中國方面官憲檢查查封拍賣等强制執行，及沒收等强制行爲，暫時以不實行爲原則，但徽稅技術上不可缺少之檢查賬簿及其他檢查，關於納稅義務者之申吿或聲明等，中國方面官懲，擬進而適應之。</p>
<p>（四）關於納稅之日本政府過渡措置：在了解事項第三項日本政府爲使日本國民基於本條約納稅起見，另行規定必要措置，即日本國民有違反課稅法規漏稅等事實時，日本政府考慮公佈罰則，或採取事實上之行政處分等，爲日本國民之名聲計，對於此種特別措置應具戒心</p>
<p>（五）關於不服糾正之措置：基於日本國民應服中華民國法令，日本國民對於中華民國官憲之行政處分（暫時不用强制力）有不服時，中華民國政府可採適當之糾正措置，其具體辦法另行硏究。</p>
<p>（六）稅制之整備：附屬協定第四條中規定中華民國現行租稅制度中心，需整備者，應從速整備之，根據前述日本其所以設定了解事項，而對中國課稅權約定某種限制程度者，實由於稅制之不完備，故深盼早日加以整備，關於通過稅及認爲其他不適當課稅，國府方面現正計劃予以撤廢。</p>
<p>（七）對違背法令之司法上措置：領事裁判權及其他關於司法之治外法權，尚未至撤消時期，於此種狀態下，依據領事裁判之一般準則，適用中華民國之適合法令，受日本領事官之裁判，如斯塲合所頒佈之罰金等，應屬於中國政府（附屬協定第二條）。然而關於稅法中罰則等尚有不明確者，又刑罰之種類及其執行，如與日本情形差異，則即難案立即實施司法的處分，在未協議決定以前，暫爲保留（了解事項第二）。關於此點，日本政府無需出於特別措置期望日本臣民注意。</p>

<p>經濟界　言評</p>
<h3>今後的課題</h3>
<p>上海公共租界也於今天同樣的由我國政府接收了！今日的情緒，好有一比，比作一個學校收歸自辦，校舍張燈結彩，師生彈冠相慶；可是，在歡欣鼓舞之中，大家就得不忘今後的課題。</p>
<p>今後上海的課題，在前日陳市長招待中外記者席上，可算解答得十分透澈了。在陳市長所解答的各項問題中，行政設施，保甲制度，敎育計劃等等而外，仍以經濟問題爲解答的核心，也可以說今後課題的什九，是有關上海經濟的。</p>
<p>在今後的經濟課題中，又以物價問題爲問答的核心。陳市長對於這一個主要問題的解答，因知爲是市民生活安定，社會合理繁榮的關鍵所在，特地不嫌煩瑣，反覆加以申明。他起先說：「物價問題，中日兩方已有詳細之討論，余深信不久當可實行；余爲執行者，當本此方針，努力以赴。」其後又說：「最近中日雙方已有穩定物價辦法的內定，惟本人未能在此發表。」足見關於此一課題，陳市長早有成竹在胸，並且是已經到了「爲政不在多言，而在力行」的時候了。</p>
<p>我們認爲此一課題的主要關鍵，還是離不開陳市長所一再提醒的兩句話：「更望雙方作金融之穩定」，「第一須視通貨有無辦法」，因爲，其他抑平物價的辦法，無論是如何有效，都不過是屬於洽標的。</p>
<h3>各業公會實施　管理同業緊急措置　協助當局壓制物價漲風</h3>
<p>各業公會自　屬於商統會下改組後經最近數旬之整頓截止昨日幾已全數進入正軌，茲據大通社記者向各公會探悉，自今日起將一致實施管理同業物價緊急措置，所以協助市政當局壓制物價漲風，維持民生安定。</p>
<p>消除膈膜　獲得瞭解</p>
<p>據云，各公會當局以前對同業經營之狀况自覺尚欠瞭解，故公會與會員間不免有膈膜之存在，茲經上月間之積極調查，截至目前，已有深切瞭解，並商得嚴密辦法，實施管理同業物價緊急措置。</p>
<p>緊急措置　抑制物價</p>
<p>該項措置，據大通社記者探悉，約包括下列數項：（一）設立調查組，專門澈查同業不法貿易。（二）公會與統制物資當局開始直接接觸，其接觸內容將不予露佈，惟有關抑制物價則爲必然事情，（三）本市各區，管辖當局機關統一後，同業會員所經營之商店，其貨價將力求統一。（四）物資配給組，每次配給情形均予公開。（五）同業會員存貨數量，交易範圍以及當事者姓名等均由公會向當局呈報。</p>
<h3>日商棉花組合　組織成立</h3>
<p>日商棉花蒐買會改組之江北棉花組合，於三十日下午二時，　日本俱樂部召開成立會議，出席者關係公司十四家，即席除通過章程外，並選出負責人員。</p>
<p>章程內容</p>
<p>國風社記者特擇錄該會章程之主要內容如下，（一）該會事業，分江北棉花之收買及輸送，棉花之栽培增產及品質改良，關於棉花之統計調查及研究。（二）本組由上海日商棉花同業公會會員十四家棉花公司組成。（三）資金總額一萬萬元，於必要時得實行增資。</p>
<p>理監名單</p>
<p>所選出該會理監事如下，（一）常務理事，森五郞，（二）理事，梁川孝，岡林廣志，秋山猛雄，藤井新治郞，栗本寅治，上松　，（三）監事兒玉長次郞，野口昌宏。</p>
<h3>各商店購印花　由各公會推銷</h3>
<p>江蘇省印花烟酒稅局，以上海兩特區內印花稅政，迭經調整推銷制度，均因受租界行政特殊關係，不能順利推行，陽奉陰違，或不照章購貼印花稅票者，不勝枚舉，以致影響銷數甚鉅，茲以兩租界已告先後交囘接收，自應嚴飭商民照章購貼，爲統一銷花防杜漏貼流弊起見，除已由財政部稅務查緝處加緊查緝外，特規定自八月一日起將印花推銷制度，改由各業同業公會集中代爲推銷，該局並令飭各業同業公會，自八月一日起，凡各業商店購貼印花，均由各業公會統計會員商店所需總額約數列單　報，聞過去兩租界區內印花銷數，月達四十萬元左右，經此次改變推銷制後，銷數尚可增加云。</p>
<h3>物資調委會　否認檢查金融</h3>
<p>物資調查委員會，現經查過之各倉庫物資，業已　報審核中，今後强化調查工作之計劃，亦在進行研究中，關於實施金融檢查一事，據該委員會負責人云：本月二十六日日文大陸新報刋登關於物資調查委員會消息，除記載第二次委員會開會情形外，並建議「金融檢查之斷行」，並引證以往事實原屬一種希望，但翌日華文各報　載時，其標題「物資調查委員會將施金融檢查」，與原文意義頗多出入，且金融檢查自有主管機關負責辦理，不在本會職權範圍，至進行調查必要時，檢查公司或倉庫賬册等措施，尤不能與金融檢查併爲一談，至已查各倉庫存貨數量，現尚在　核　之中，　縣　數目不足憑信，調查官權限現已於調查官服務規則中明白規定，一切措置均以法律爲根據，此亦本會之基本信念也。</p>
<h3>華股趨勢</h3>
<p>昨華股徘徊上升，多再出現新高峯，各方目標集中，老投資者執住，新買戶日增，勢呈易升難囘，照各方人心仍多向榮，雖値週六而交易旺達，百貨業之永安公司突出八關外，新新及國貨亦步亦趨內衣漲度更巨，連躍兩　景福衫襪再見新高價，惟景綸較爲平穩。光華及國安百貨買勢未减，紡織業之永安紡織疲後終與上日軋平，新豐·宏甡·國光·國信·振豐·仁豐·大中華·美綸·榮豐·信和等小票面紡織股各有進展，大生一三兩廠上升尤爲驚人，文化業絕少賣戶，實乏成交，商務·中華·世界三書局又各升數十，均見高價，新藥業新亞較前日上升數元，五洲·中西·信誼·明星香水喊價更高，公用業閘北水電與華商電氣，前者呆平，後者突叩三關，實業股進戶踴躍，久安實業突出八關，大中華實業漲風加厲與中國投資買戶喊價日高，向無生色之三樂實業，亦漸有投資者問津，價越票面五成新亞建業又升數元，聯華及新益地產拉抬之風未息，南洋烟公司穩定，大中華火柴突告平疲，康元製　飛上見速，標準味粉。福民乳品·吉美食品均在買勢中各越關外，標準紙品，進戶亦多，晋　造紙再叩三關，大華　植有增資消息，亦爲買戶矚目，上海三輪升越票面六成，華一造船中國磚瓦·華豐塘瓷·中興木業均堅挺逾恒，中運電影價又穿上云。</p>

<h3>談取締投機與抑平物價</h3>
<p>— 澍人</p>
<p>（二）限制電話使用：在統制經濟時代，一切物力，須力求節約，上海自投機市塲發達以來，電話使用驚人增加。衹要聽聽，一架電話機秘密出　，代價需五千一萬，可知一般。當局已禁止刊物登載物價行市消息，爲什麽不可以來一下電話使用限制，雙管齊下，使投機份子失去視聽，稍歛行跡，旣節物力，又與投機者一嚴重打擊。或謂此項辦法有碍工商發展，則拎起話筒，等待十分廿分鐘而接不通，又豈正當工商界之福？</p>
<p>（三）凍結物資：關於物資統制、當局早有各種具體辦法，筆者主張，更進一步制裁私人囤貨。檢查倉庫私人囤貨，飭查公司行號真相，以防私人假借名義；限制棧單過戶，以防私人交易；獎勵檢舉；禁止廠商以巨額貨物售與個人。廠商囤積業外貨物，一槪禁止。工廠商店原料存貨，一律與以凍結，嚴格辦理，以防逃避，工廠動用　料，須申請核准，視其生產品之是否必需。出產品如無門市部出售，廠方須立即配給另售商，以供大衆銷費。工廠不准以保持原料而故意停工。一部分製造商如缺乏原料，當局可由別處徵發得以平價供給之，商店銷貨物，由當局每日核准一定額，以節約消費，杜絕後門交易，使其無法拒售，買賣利潤在商店，出賣權限在當局，則超越限價，有價無貨等怪現象都可消滅。</p>
<p>在一切日用品實施全面配給之前，上述三點可作治標之法。（完）</p>
<h3>輔助民食不足　雜糧續到滬</h3>

<h3>對於交還租界的幾個意見</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>說老實話</p>
<p>最近有很多日本人問我，此次交還租界，一般中國人在怎樣高興着？我對於囘答這個詢問，倒是一件項困難的事。因爲要正確地囘答這個詢問，就必須寫幾大部書。當然一部份中國人，尤其能想到交還租界的政治意義者，對於這一詢問立刻能夠囘答說，交還租界是解放中國的第一步，是東亞和平的基礎。但只聽到這些人的話後，便認爲上海所有的中國人都在高興交還租界的事，這是不可以的。沒有參與政治的時間與金錢者——事實上上海大部份人口，都是由這種人構成的—他們在理解交還租界的政治意義之前，首先考慮租界交還後自己生活所受到的影響。因此在這般人眼光看來，交還租界後的米價總理怎樣？或是戶口米是否比現在要减少？這個問題比交還租界對大東亞前途所生的政治意義更爲重大。這種人對交還租界是否喜歡，是以租界交還後的租界行政好壞爲轉移，租界交還後的租界行政如果好，則除掉租界上重慶派的中國人外都一定雀躍着高興租界交還。然而假如租界交還後，租界行政有惡化的傾向，那末即使交還租界的理想與目的無論如何崇高，而租界上的大部份中國人都會無動於中的。因此，我認爲現在提出是否喜歡交還租界問題，仍有過早之嫌。</p>
<p>我們姑且不談實際問題，而只就理論方面說，當然交還租界，站在中國人的立塲上來說，是應當高興的，然而在目前的形勢上，這畢竟是「應當如此」的Sollen問題，而並非「如此」的Sein問題。旣然如此，交還租界的政治意義究竟在什麽地方呢？筆者這樣想，交還租界是日本打算使落後的現實迅速達到「應當如此」的理想之表示。國民政府在現階段上，究竟是否比晒更善於處理租界　政，說一句老實話，這是眞是一個疑問，儘管如此，日本把地理上大東亞共榮圈的中心都市上海的行政交與國民政府，這是日本根據對中國的政治信念所實行的政策。日本希望以滿足比原來中國的現實更前進數步的中國理想，來迅速使現實迎頭趕上理想。</p>
<p>國民政府是否能使現實迅速地趕上理想，這就應當是國民政府的當　最大課題。上海和南京不同，而上海是具有國際性的。上海的居民，有英美帝國主義者，也有全世界五十三國的人種在混雜着。說句不好聽的話，上海居民是鹵莽的，往好一點說，是令千軍萬馬奔馳中的衆騎士。如國民政府能使這批上海居民心悅誠服，則可在全世界面前證明自己的行政能力。陳友仁氏曾說過：「今日上海所想者，即明日全中國所想者」，假如南京政府今日能使上海民衆信服，則明日使全中國人民信服，我認爲倒不是一件難事。反過來說，假如南京政府在上海的行政上失敗的話，其失敗即是在世界面前的失敗，同時，那也是給大東亞戰爭的一個大打擊，所以日本也就不能默爾而息，說「與我無　」的風涼話。由此觀之，交還上海租界，由此觀之，交還上海租界，在某種意義上也可以說是課與國民政府的一種嚴重試騐，但這並非是單純對國民政府的試騐，且是加諸上海市民的一個嚴重試騐，因爲政治是政府與人民的相對關係，好的政治如無人民好的協助是不可能的。再進一步說，那也是課與日本的一個嚴重的試騐，因爲站在上海的現實觀點上來說，上海的善良政治如與日本的善良協助，是不可能的。我就在這種　地上，希望大家注意下而不應當有的三個傾向。</p>
<p>第一，先說國民政府內部的一種傾向。現在南京政府中的據說有些人對於交還上海租界興奮得觀天喜地，正如投考學校的學生得到入學考試及格通知書那樣快活，但普通對於考試却是頂討厭的。考試及格，這是因爲知道入學考試是由非常的刻苦用功才能通過的一個難關；不知道入學考試是一個難關，而認爲不用刻苦用功的方法，也可以通過的人，多半會名落孫山。今日國民政府的人們，必須知道租界交還後的租界行政，是由國民政府的非常刻苦用功才能通過的一個大難關。租界交還是給國民政府的入學考試。但對於交還租界只知道高興，而不知道用悲壯的决心來應付　一重大事件，那實在是遺憾事。考試還未通過，現在就高興起來，不免樂觀過早，我希望應當有這種覺悟。</p>
<p>第二，現在說一下一部份日本人中的一種傾向，即對所謂「新政策」的極左主義的解釋。嚴格說來，所謂「新政策」決不是把一切交給中國後，就可以一切都不管了。租界交還中國，其結果，租界的行政權移交國民政府，因而租界的行政好壞，是中國自己的事，如萬一在日本人間也有這樣想法的人存在，那是完全不懂得交還租界的意義。關於今後租界的行政是否能好，如無充分的透視，而只靠理想的交還國民政府，這一點即使國民政府高興，但結局，上海市民也不會高興，日本當然預先看到租界交還後的上海行政，在國民政府管轄之下，有充分發展的可能，而才想這樣作。因此，實際上當上海行政如進行得不順利的塲合，日本也有很大的責任。上海是對重慶思想戰的最前綫，上海的行政如實行得不好，上海市民的生活更加困難，那末就會成爲重慶及英美攻擊的口實。因此，日本雖說把租界交還國民政府，但對於上海的行政，仍然需要以監護人的資格好好加以注意，尤其必須充分注意對市民實際生活有重大關係的物資配給機構（其中最重要者爲戶口米）和監察機構等問題。在此我要率直地說一下，關於將來的警察機構，在目前上海市民間有某種程度的畏懼。上海市民還記憶得很淸楚，不久前曾講過的「第二種親日派」一黨，在滬西躱身於特別警察的名義裏，作過不少罪大惡極的勾當，他們捉人是爲了要錢，實在是一種政治綁票，這類政治綁票匪徒，雖然各自受到法律的嚴重制裁，但上海市民現在仍然認爲這樣敗類餘黨還有，且認爲此輩再捲土重來上海，發揮其爲非作歹的拿的好戲，則眞有點「吃不消」。因此，在上海警察機構內，都不應當再讓上海市民發生對政治綁票期待的恐怖心理那樣人的存在。</p>
<p>第三，現在叙述一下上海市民間的一種傾向。人類在某一種塲合上，有時不得不指鹿爲馬，生物學者稱之爲「個體保存本能」，中國人美其名曰「保身術」，但一般上海市民的指鹿爲馬的情形，好像也實在太多了。甚至關於交還租界的感想，從上海市民的嘴裏所聽到的，那一部份是眞心流露，那一部份是「保身術」的敷衍話，實在不容易判斷；在這一點上我認爲爲政者的確不好辦。因此，如不吐露眞心實話與爲政者打成一片，則上海的善良政治是不會有的。交還租界，最受到直接影響的地方，即是上海的市民生活。上海市民如對於政治抱着一向那種消極觀念，今後的租界行政前途決不會單純是光明的一面，當今後的租界行政成爲黑暗的塲合，其一部份責任要歸到對協助懈怠的上海市民身上。因此，上海市民應當少　再恢復一點說馬即馬，鹿即鹿的態度，我希望上海市民要常常以以眞心實話供獻政府。租界交還後的上海行政，如無上海市民的協助，無論如何決不會順利成長。上海發展成爲中國的世界有名大都市呢？抑還是像解去拴繩的膠船一樣很快地凋落簫條下去呢？這是由上海市民對政治的態度如何而決定的。上海市民對租界行政不加任何協助，而只知非難評擊把租界行政弄糟了的爲政者，這是一種卑怯行爲。</p>
<p>上海市民乘此時機，最好組織民意機關，即爲上海行政的順利發展起見，也應當積極向當局提供民意。</p>
<p>以上便是我對於交還租界的意見。單純在歷史上探討交還租界的意義，可以說，和劇烈無比的大東亞戰事之現實，不相配合。因此，單單　醉於「租界交還了，謝天謝地」這類高興話裏，而對於租界交還後的各種無數困難問題，也仍然不容易解決，同時我認爲也對不起，擔心租界交還後各自生活　途的三百萬市民之急切情緒。我在講租界交還的慶祝話之前，先提醒大家一下，這是課與中日兩國人民最困難的入學考試。（漢　）</p>
<h3>交還上海租界之感想與希望</h3>
<p>我們爲慶祝接收上海租界，編行特輯，並以「感想與希望」爲題徵集宏文。荷承中日人士惠賜佳作，無任欣幸。茲將（一）波多博先生（二）赤星爲光先生（三）吳凱聲先生（四）李權時先生等四篇先予發表。於此敬向作者表示感謝。</p>
<p>—編者誌</p>
<p>其一：波多博</p>
<p>上海之公共租界，爲英美侵華之要港。在過去百年間，給予中國人以何種印象，其塗炭中國民衆及中國之志土仁人如何欲將其收囘而苦心籌劃，茲已毋容贅述。總之，此彼等所恃爲强固之橋頭堡，一經歸還，則中國之主權，已得完整，實爲一可慶可賀之事。若對日方所斷然予以歸還之心理，妄試猜測，或對國際情勢，有所遲疑杞憂，是應加以警戒。蓋此次戰爭，已至勢不兩立，而爲國家存亡所繫，如已往之和平會議，當不致重見，一切將取決於戰勝，此戰乃非勝不可，而現正在節節勝利中，至渝方則因此種種新事實，早已失其固執抗戰之理由。殊不知其固何爲平而仍在對日抗戰也！</p>
<p>鄙人所最熱望者，爲租界交還後上海之經濟，若以租界交還爲機會，不顧國家威信與國利民福，竟汲汲於一己權益之獲致及擁護，是誠應爲國人所一致唾棄，且亦有失信用於友邦，反足招致爲敵所利之結果。吾人在慶祝租界之交還，同時私願一向偃臥於英美勢力下之上海租界，一旦重歸中國治下後，必能倍加努力，而完成數倍之發展，化爲萬邦民衆安居樂業之區也。</p>
<p>囘顧百年前英國在中國掀起鴉片之戰，而終以迫訂南京條約爲此役之歸結，此南京條約，實即侵害中國領土主權之始作俑者。繼之者即爲香港島之割贖，上海等五埠之通商以及租界之開設，使中國從此屈服於外來勢力者，要亦種因於此。此後百年間，在中國國內，曾引起種種運動，如稍近之義和團事件，康梁之變法，辛亥革命之勃發，以及孫中山先生之大亞細亞主義等，無一不堅主打倒帝國主義與廢除不平等條約；而在後之國民革命運動，此種主張，尤爲激烈，且以此爲號召，蹶起於中國之南部，終乃得一統中國，實聞中國歷史上未有之新例。惜此國民政府，隨年月之消逝，漸將當初之主張抹煞，反甘心屈服於英美帝國主義庇護之下，遂致有中日事變之發生。</p>
<p>當中日事變發生之時，擁戴蔣介石之抗日派，高呼保存領土主權之完整，擁護民族之獨立，固執抗日到底以至於今日，而失地及於華北，華中，華南之廣大地域，文化實業地區，更無一尚存，僅得遠走邊疆，偏處蜀中，以保　喘。　乎大東亞戰爭發生後，所謂渝方政權，即失却其自身存在之意義，推斷其抗戰之理由。蓋其抗戰至此已不能謂爲保障中國之領土及中國之民族而戰，實已化爲英美之一異，卒至甘爲彼等之利害而犧牲。一方日本已將英美勢力，自其盤據已近百數十年之中國及其他大東亞地域，一掃而盡，正期藉東亞諸民族之自覺與奮起，以達共同完成此戰爭之目的。南京國民政府，亦爲貫澈同生共死之精神，實現與日方眞誠協力，毅然對英美宣戰。凡此均爲勢所必趨，理所當然者。此外日本更爲分担共同保衛東亞之責任，援助中國之自主獨立，使其日臻繁榮，因將南北各地之日本專管租界及北京使館區，厦門鼓浪嶼租界一一歸還。今者英美侵略我東亞之最先端之橋頭堡，即上海之公共租界，亦已定八月一日正式歸還，此亦所以表示日本在中日關係中之誠意者也。</p>
<p>其二：赤星爲光</p>
<p>當本年一月九日國民政府宣言參戰的那一天，日本政府同日就聲明交還上海公共租界。經過半載後的六月三十日，發表細目協定，由市政府與工部局之間，進行關於移交準備，業已決定於八月一日，公共租界由國民政府收囘，名符其實的恢復到中國主權之下。又法租界：法政府亦於本年二月二十三日：聲明放棄在華特權，實施交還天津，　漢口，廣東的三處法國專管租界，繼於七月二十一日，由中法兩國當局決定關於交還上海法國專管的細目條款；並定於七月三十日由國民政府收囘。考一百年前，因鴉片戰爭，遂有南京條約的締結，從這裏所產生的英美榨取中國的根據地公共租界，以及一八四九年法國根據中法條約模仿英美而獲得的法租界，從此不再存在於中國領土內，八月一日起在國民政府之主權下實施新市政。此種光榮，是中國四萬萬國民臥薪嘗胆力求實現此宿願的結果，掃除了中國百年的污點，恢復了中國的完全獨立權，這眞是世紀的快事。在中國四千年歷史上，平添了一頁光榮史。譬如爲父母者喪亡了一個愛子，其悲哀情緒，衹有爲父母者才知。中國人今日的歡喜，衹有受過外國治外法權與土地租借權之苦的日本人才能理解，就是筆者，也懷着「同慶之至」的心情，胸中不禁有無限感激與興奮。</p>
<p>中國事變，發生於中日雙方的誤會，當然是中日兩國的不幸，也就是東亞的大不幸。此種誤解的責任，中日雙方都要負担，然而其誤解，因近衛聲明與汪主席響應近衛聲明的艷電之後，中日兩國之間，已經冰釋。此項誤解，剷除了中國對日抗戰的理由，嗣由汪主席倡導和組建，確立了以中日平等互惠爲理念的同生共死之提携關係。日國民政府參加大東亞戰爭，以英美爲敵，興盟幫日本同爲解放東亞而駢肩作戰。但重慶政權至今猶依存英美，繼續其毫無理由之抗戰。總之，這種矛盾，因爲重慶政權僻處四川內地，日本的眞意，無從傳達。更沒有機會正視中日兩國的維繫於道義的新事態，所以：至今依然誤解不解，汪主席是中國人，蔣介石也是中國人，同爲產生於東洋道德的人。總有一天，這個誤解也會烟消雲散，確信到這一天，南京重慶都會當做這世紀中國的快事，不，一定當做全東亞的快事鼓舞歡欣。以日本人的感情而論，對於所謂收囘租界這一中國的歷史上事件：在今日中國最不幸的時候欣逢此盛舉不禁表示深切同情。這是因爲對於他的歡欣有了深切理解，不以爲是別人的事，而當做自身的事而歡喜。</p>
<p>最近看見了好多對華新政策的文字，這實在是眞政策之誤，交還租界，撤廢治外法權，這些政策，在近衛聲明當時，早就決定的了，此可認爲是日本對華眞政策的基本方針。所以新政策應該叫做眞政策才對。按近衛三原則，就是日本對華眞政策最明顯的表示，理解所謂八紘爲字的神勅者，就是日本人的信念，日本人的觀念。今日可謂到達了具體實現其政策的機會。在過去日本爲了保護東亞，早就有和英美勢力對抗的必要。當英美侵略中國，東亞積極化的時候，日本的國力，尚未達到靑年之域，與其不能以武力抵制此等强國，毋　培養自己的國力，留待他日之用。由於對抗英美勢力的必要，培養國力的手段是當然的了。列强假使在中國獲得租界。日本自然也是要的。日本這種對抗手段，表面上是採取侵略的形態，而事實上也應該率真承認其含有對華侵略的內容。不過，目的始終是和英美對抗，無非是要增强自己國力的手段，本質上和英美大不相同。但是中國的對日誤解，從茲產生，這是無可否認的。而日本的國力成長，遂向英美開戰。現在日本與盟邦同傾國力，爲解放東亞，確立東亞共榮圈，而向完成大東亞戰爭邁進，英美在東亞的勢力，已被擊毀，現在日本已能一掃英美在中國的對抗勢力。而且日本在其國力上，已經到達了壯年。並不須要模仿英美侵佔租界的那種海賊行爲，就是對於日軍忠勇將以鮮血換來的佔領地緬甸，菲律賓，也以友邦的地位，聲明助成其獨立。這就是一個最有力的明證。</p>
<p>日本的對華政策，說得現實一點，就是對英美政策。與過去的對華政策，因大東亞戰爭的發生，其目標完全轉換，向眞正目的突進。所以，對華政策從過去的對抗英美手段而還元到日本本來的道義政策，這是必然的結果，日本本來之道，就是恢復對華新政策，具有最大意義的交還租界，就是其具體實現的第一步，撤廢治外治權，這也是當然的，唯有如此措施，才可算得日本對華眞政策的本來面目，其中，毫無權謀計策更沒有爲自己打算的意圖。中國收囘這個租界，日本對國民政府旣無何種條件，也沒有什麽要求，所以毅然實行者，無非是表現日本對華眞政策的本來面目。可是，還有一點遺憾的，就是這個機會恰巧碰在大東亞戰爭更激烈的時候。希望大家千萬不要被挑撥中日兩國關係的敵方反宣傳所惑，歪曲判斷日本的眞意，而　凟了中國四萬萬民衆多年的努力。日本的對華眞政策，從抽象的論，以事實發展到實現階段的今日，在過去僅僅表面上見聞，日本對華政策的人，恐怕誰都要不信；發展得如此快，或許日本人之間，也會有一部份人懷疑。或許是日本的敗退政策，也說不定是採實讓名的政策，這都是誤會的批判。要知日本現在獨立也能獲致大東亞戰爭的勝利，擁有充沛的戰力，且具有鐵石的決心。此種事實，日本的指導者等，也曾反覆說明，况有具體的事實可資證明，無論在任何部份，絕無表示敗退政策的必要。目的所在，還是要國民政府的主權獨立，領土完整，把過去阻碍其國力伸長與國內團結的租界和治外法權剷除，以幸其自强，使國府達到參戰的目的。日本政府排除了一切困難，以事實表現此對華眞政策，這是對於中國及中國人的一個重大試練，而中國及中國人對此誠意，以何種對日態度答覆，這可認爲維繫今後中日關係的重大關鍵。</p>
<p>筆者旣非考古學者，也不是統計學的愛好者，而且因爲事務太忙的緣故。所以不欲從古書上去搜集什麽執筆資料，單把我自己預先想到的作爲感想寫這一篇。旣不是故意，當然也沒有惡意，就在此擱筆了。（雲鵬譯）</p>
<p>其三：吳凱聲</p>
<p>我國自受英美帝國主義誘惑，而實行門戶開放主義以來，國勢日頹，尤於一八四三年中英鴉片戰爭失敗之後，英美各國相繼對我國加以種種不平等條約桎梏，使我光明偉大之歷史上染了斑斑恥辱的血漬，廣大幅員上點綴着列强侵略我國主權之巢穴——租界。流毒百年，致使我國淪爲次殖民地之地位。</p>
<p>國父孫總理有鑒于租界畸形制度之存在，實係侵略我國主權，妨礙民族生存發展的莫大禍根，早有決心廢除不平等條約以求中國之自由解放。迨辛亥革命吿成，推翻滿淸，建立民國，然英美帝國主義仍利用一般流亡政客和軍閥餘孽從中作崇，借租界爲護身符，掀風作浪，禍國殃民，無惡不作。三十載以還，內亂頻仍，國幾不國。雖然，國內有志之士屢思爲收囘租界而努力奮鬥，終由於英美的粳陰，迄未能達到目的。</p>
<p>自本年一月九日國府宣吿參加大東亞戰爭以後，友邦日本首先以道義精神，聲明撤廢在華治外法權，並陸續將各地之日本專管租界交還國府，此種誠摯之表示，我全國人民莫不衷心感動。嗣法國政府亦當仁不讓，自動於二月二十三日聲明交還租界並撤廢治外法權，本年三月二十九日即與我國外交部交換放棄北京使館區域內行政權之照會。本年四月八日，又交換放棄鼓浪嶼公共租界行政權之照會，本年五月十八日，復簽訂交還津漢粵三地法租界行政權之實施細目協定，並已於六月五日正式接收。自六月三十日經中日雙方簽訂交還上海公共租界，同時中法兩國代表經友邦從中幹旋，即致力於上海法租界之交還工作，經再三磋商和友邦的儘力折衝，順利完遂，已於七月二十二日在首都正式簽字</p>

<p>以下第一版轉來</p>
<p>，決定於七月三十日舉行交還儀式。此舉與公共租界之收囘得在同一期之內實現，足使全國國民發生無限欣慰，對中國解放前途　手稱慶，際此租界收囘聲中，緬懷革命先烈的奮鬥，遠瞻新中國自由解放的前途，實有深切感慨，茲略抒感想與希望，當國人共勉之。</p>
<p>（一）大東亞戰爭發生以後，英美侵略勢力已被擊崩潰，然而英美在思想上所種之毒藥，則尚未完全廓淸，因爲上海租界正是英美毒素最根深蒂固的基地，此次當局接收公共租界，即是對於英美侵略勢力之澈底廓淸，從此毒來藏垢納污之地即將洗滌乾淨，而還復我中華國土之本來面目，迷信英美的錯誤觀念，亦將一　而爲依賴本國政府之偉大心理。</p>
<p>（二）法國政府之賢明措置固爲友邦日本道義精神所激勵，然其好意之表示乃基於兩國互相諒解，中法兩國在此次大戰之中，同爲受英美欺騙的國家，故中國對法國的遭遇，實有特殊深切之同情。法國對我國誠摯的友誼，我們非常感佩。自上海法租界交還以後，中法兩國道義邦交必然踏入一新的階段，而愈趨於友好，自無疑義。</p>
<p>（三）友邦日本此番對我的協助之誠意，在谷大使最近於中國國民外交促進會歡迎席上所發表的「對華眞政策之實現」演詞中已可預見，吾人應當如何奮勵，以　邁進，要知中國一日有租界存在，中國是不會獲得眞正獨立自由的地位，想到租界收囘後的上海，必然成爲中日協力以擊滅英美帝國主義的一個中心，所謂國際地都市從此決不會再有英美的暗影，而唯有大東亞共存共樂的光彩。中華國土將永遠成爲自由樂土。爲了報答友邦援助我國獨立解放的誠意，全國上下更應聯合一致與友邦密切合作，協力完遂大東亞戰爭，惟有大東亞戰爭的全面勝利，始能解放全東亞民族，而使永享和平幸福的生活。</p>
<p>上海無論在中國與國際都占着重要的地位。它是中國經濟的中心。因而國內政治文化等之發展，莫不受其深刻影響。又是一國際都市，　爲國際間角逐之塲，今租界收囘，頓改舊觀，其影響於國際視聽者極大，其有裨於我主權提高者亦至鉅。百年宿望一日實現，全賴我最高領袖汪主席以崇高之人格作堅苦之奮鬥，故能獲得友邦之同情，克遂復興之大業。本人對前途之希望，厥有四端：</p>
<p>（一）擴大市政機構，統一行政效能。—過去因爲租界畸形制度的存在，國家的主權往往在租界內本能行使，上海一隅成爲「國中之國」，不但行政司法軍政等不受政府中樞的命令，卽警務稅收等市政亦另樹一幟。今全國租界均吿收囘，主權獨立，領土完整，上海爲東亞大都市之一，共榮國之紐帶，今後市政之設施，勢必大加整頓，不但機構擴大，職權增强，人事問題，亦須愼加遴選。今後當秉承中樞施策，積極建設新的「大上海」都市。正如褚外交部長所說：「中國政府將竭其全力使之發展成爲世界所稱羨之都市。」此不僅是余個人之希望，恐爲全國人民的希望。</p>
<p>（二）安定民生，抑平物價。—上海處於大東亞戰爭後方的最前綫。例應實施戰時體制，安定民生亦爲戰時體制重要施　之一。於租界正式收囘之前，上海物價重見高翔。長此以往對國民心理有莫大影響，間接對於國家施政亦有相當阻碍，當局雖極力設法調查囤積居有之因素，嚴　奸商，抑平物價，然治　收效不宏。方今租界收囘，確立新的市政，深　當局體念民生，從事硏究安定民生之根本施策，例如改善　給制度，增加生產，澈底肅淸囤積投機之風，積極取締擾亂民心之謠言。助長投機之風一戢，物價自搊平定，居民得安居樂業，對政府信賴之心益堅，此乃必然之趨勢。</p>
<p>（三）整飭風紀，提倡節約。—上海居民歷來醉心「洋化」，崇尚奢侈。於今戰爭時期，例應提倡節約。租界收囘後，英美毒化思想將全部肅淸，新國民運動當爲國民所崇奉之生活信條。公務須養成廉潔從公之精神，努力工作。一切虛偽奢侈之酬酢大可省却。平民亦應崇尚儉勤樸素，有罪己之精神，各在本位努力，平時一切無謂交際，定領减少，新的大上海須成爲普遍實行新國民運動之模範都市。</p>
<p>（四）治安確立，努力建設。—以前公共租界和法租界組織之保甲制度確是維持治安之長策。今在租界收囘以後。市政設施亦加改革，則保甲制度甚足稱羡，但尚須改進，深望警務負責當局對今後之治安勢力保障，須知上海所處之地位，無論對中國或國際皆甚重要，平時治安之確立，乃是租界接收以後重要問題之一，深望人民與當局協力維持。治安確立，民生安定，然後才能埋首若幹，從事　　生產工作。預期此次租界全部收囘，將有更偉大的開展。深望全國朝野，一心一德，在汪主席領導之下益加淬勵，與各盟邦協力邁進，完成復興中華，保衛東亞之歷史使命，庶不辜負各盟邦對於我們的一番厚意，凡吾同胞共勉之。</p>
<p>其四：李權時</p>
<p>一八四二年八月二十九日中英訂立南京條約，鴉片戰爭終止，約訂五日通商，上海租界自此始。自前年大東亞戰爭爆發以還，英美勢力逐出遠東，今日承友邦好意將上海租界在法理上完全交還中國管理，距其在法律上之開始　　爲一百足年差二十八日，是誠値得大書特書大慶特慶者也。</p>
<p>或謂友邦之交還上海公共租界及其他華北中華南各處租界，不過是慷他人之慨罷了；然則英美政府在數月前亦口口聲聲向重慶方面聲明　即撤廢治外法權及取消　國內沿江沿海各租界，又何嘗不是慷他人之慨呢？總之，世局演變已至目前階段，無論友敵，均不得不幡然改圖，以斯挽囘民心，　助空前大戰之有利於己國的結束也。故無論將來世局再有何演變，中國各處租界—包括上海租界—必將永久留在祖國的懷抱裏，不再有再度被攫入帝國主義國家的魔掌中的危險了，這是記者膽敢斷言了。</p>
<p>當此租界制度的最後堡壘—上海公共租界與法租界—撤消於時代環境的重壓下之　，記者忝爲中華數萬萬國民之一，又自然情不自禁地願與國民同浮一大白。</p>
<p>慶祝之餘，希　望之。第一，希望此後戎國行政當局淸愼動公地管理租界，不特不負友邦　期　，而且能與國人中之悲觀論者，以及風凉論者，甚或至幸災樂禍論者以一帖淸凉散。友邦送來的羣　禮物，不特不被糟蹋蹂躪，而且還能錦上添花，精益求精。第二，希望上海租界亦即最後的租界收囘之後，中國的內亂不再如過去數十年之頻仍，以反對中央之軍人政客不再有安全的策源地陰謀塲也。第三，希望上海租界交還後，上海之人不再爲「新猶太人」，只知自保身家利益，投機取巧，不顧國計民生之如何結局，而毅然負起此大時代所與賦於我們的責任，頑廉懦立，洗心革面，趕快變　「新中國人」，恢復我們已喪失了一百多年的民族自尊心。第四，希望上海租界收囘之後，全國游資不再集中上海，全國工業也不　趨集滬上，務須有合理的分散於全國各地的工業化計劃，然上海爲大東亞之第二貿易港的地位，以其地理上處境優越，恐始終得以保持，不易爲他港所奪也。第五，上海租界收囘之後，我國中央政府之課稅權得以自由地進出於　稅寓公　集的租界，則以後直接能力稅如地價稅，土地增値稅，所得稅，遺產稅，非常時期過份利得稅（按非常時期過份利得亦即戰前暴利或國難橫財之別名，國難財旣發後，而須大大的付稅，則減爲他人作嫁衣裳，不如不發國難財之爲愈也，故此稅　大有抑制不法商人恣意發國難財的心理之作用。）等自能通行於滬上，不特國府財政得由此獲一生力軍，而且徵稅之後果將爲通貨之部份收囘，與物價之得以收相當安定的作用焉，希望爲事實之母，吾願上述五種希望之必能不久實現，以慰數百萬滬上市民與數萬萬全國國民也。</p>
<h3>接收上海租界與今後的運營</h3>
<p>— 松田常雄</p>
<p>（一）國民政府接收上海公共租界行政權，定於八月一日實現。百年來英美所踞爲中國殖民地化政策的據點之上海公共租界，至此在中國，在日本，在東亞全體看來，誠爲値得慶幸的盛事。</p>
<p>國民政府恢復上海的主權，主持上海的政治經濟，無疑的將迅速充實强化國民政府今後的政治力。中國事變前，蔣政權之所以能迅速强大者，實因蔣介石在民國十六年放棄所謂聯蘇容共政策，於四月十二日在上海實行一百八十度的大轉變，與上海的有錢階級妥協所致。事實上，以浙江財閥爲中心的中國財富之大部分，集中於上海，占中國對外貿易的百分之五十左右，上海租界享有特殊的政治地位，「在中國而非中國所有」。</p>
<p>自中國事變至大東亞戰爭的約五年間，這特殊性被英美的援蔣政策所利用，上海租界成爲抗日的據點，動輒對日本表示露骨的敵對性。然大東亞戰爭勃發後，事態爲之一變，英美的權益完全被日軍浸收管理，侵略東亞的據點，全吿覆滅，依存英美資本的上海經濟，與英美的勢力絕緣。向來對國民政府的和平運動取冷淡的模稜態度的上海財界，即從利害的打算上，也不能不改變其對大東亞新事態的看法。本年一月九日，國民政府的參戰與日本的展開對華新政策後，即組織全國商業統制總會，上海財界巨頭二十名担任該會理事，監事，這是上海財界轉變態度，進而協助國民政府之施策的一種證明。自日軍進駐租界，並使租界的警備警察在日本方面指導之下後，租界的中國居民之間即有保甲的組織，並獲得良好的成績，以前他們是中山先生所說的「一盤散沙」，他們所過的生活可說是無政府狀態，現在過這種有秩序有組織的生活，不能不說是意外的變化。</p>
<p>（二）在這裏，我們有囘顧一下上海租界在今日以前，以「在中國而中國所有」的這一特殊性格而繁榮的由來的必要。</p>
<p>關於上海的繁榮，李却特，飛達姆的報吿指出道：</p>
<p>「租界內的財富與商業的活動之集中，實因租界是一種安全的島嶼，不受外來騷擾的侵犯，在其範圍內，秩序被維持，個人的權利，財產權，被尊敬且被保護的緣故」。</p>
<p>的確，上海租界被關係各國的海軍及工部局的義　隊保護着，對中國的內亂，常維持其中立性，拒絕中國軍隊進入租界，上海租界因有這武力而與中國本身的政治隔離，不被中國的政治的混亂與不安所波及，避免中國的軍閥及派閥之獨占的支配。此事妨害了中國主權的完整，同時，上海的繁榮之鍵亦在於此。</p>
<p>然而用這種方式獲致的上海的繁榮，決不是爲了中國本身。</p>
<p>因上海的繁榮而獲利的，是英美的資本，是附庸於英美資本的中國買辦資本。中國雖然是農業國，但不絕地被慢性的食糧不足所困，每年不能輸入洋米，以資補充，其最大的原因當然是中國本身的農業生產力之荒廢，但同時外國農產品經由上海市塲而實行作對華傾銷，外國工業製品與中國農作物之强制的不等價交換等等，英美資本主義之無情的榨取侵略，無疑的也妨害了中國農業的發展。</p>
<p>中國雖在華北，華中有適宜的棉作地，但上海的中國紡織業，不依靠中國產的棉花，常賴美棉印棉的輸入。</p>
<p>同樣，中國的製粉業者，與內地的麥作無關係，反與澳麥結不解緣。如此，以上海租界爲據點而踏進的英美資本主義，切斷了上海與中國農村的聯系，通過上海的經濟而榨取中國的經濟，以爲其殖民地化政策的犧牲。上海租界的繁榮，可說建築於中國全體的貧乏上，而更爲狡猾的中國買辦資本，不過作英美資本的走狗以自肥而已。</p>
<p>因此，上海以「在中國而非中國所有」的特殊性格而繁榮起來的話，含有二種意義。其一，上海租界因此而常表示如何從中國本身之政治的腐敗混亂而加以保護的方式，其二，由此，英美以上海租界爲侵略中國的據點，蹂躪中國的主權，榨取中國的經濟。</p>
<p>（三）這裏的問題，國民政府恢復上海租界的行政權後，將如何運營上海的政治經濟。汪主席曾說：因國民政府的參戰，中國所應負担的任務是「建設大後方基地」。這是今後上海的經濟上，當然是根本原則。上海位於蜿蜒三千餘哩，具有悠久歷史的長江的入海口，其背後所擁的是中國最豐穰的土地與稠密的人口之流域，這地理的情况無論怎樣說來總是上海之最大的長處。這長處不能不充分加以利用。</p>
<p>在中國經濟的境况上，要謀增强生產，要謀安定民生，改善民生，而欲維持通貨以期獲得物價對策的效果，非先使物資流通便利，難期解决。中國事變以後，以上海爲中心的中國工業生產之停頓，以及隨之而來的農村生活必需物資的不足及物價高翔，使向來依賴上海工業生產的內地農村經濟自給自足化，上海經濟與內地經濟表示一種迅速分離的傾向，而加深民衆生活的不安。這是不能否定的事實。此又助長了集中於上海租界的中國民族資本之投機性，增大了換物熱，囤積居奇等的弊害，刺激物價騰貴。</p>
<p>爲打開這現狀，所以日本對華經濟新政策首先開放並緩和揚子江下游區域的經濟封鎖。三月十六日全部撤廢了向來在當地軍隊之手的取締物資移動，除上海地區一部份物資的搬出入外，和平地區全域的物資移動已獲自由，而恢復上海及其背後的農村地帶之聯繫。與此同時，基於所謂「分工合作」的觀念，把華中方面中國物資的收買配給委讓於華方，以促進其商業活動，一面更繼續交還新舊各種敵產，使上海的遊資動員於農工部門的生產，打開中國民族資本向生產資本轉化復活之途。</p>
<p>除上述新情勢外，再加上了此次的接收上海公共租界行政權。國民政府與上海經濟界的聯繫合作，益趨密切，國民政府以上海的經濟力爲支撐，將能有力地發揮其政治力，而顯著地促進中國經濟的復興，進而至於中國對完遂大東亞戰爭的協力。</p>
<p>（四）今後上海政治經濟的運營，自然應基於建設大東亞共榮圈這根本的要求而實施，在這裏，第一，我們希望不單育成上海爲中國經濟的中心，而爲大不亞共榮圈之最重要的經濟的一環。上海不應僅爲中國而存在，爲了建設大東亞是新的「中國問題」，「上海問題」。</p>
<p>杉村　藏博士在其所著「中國上海的經濟諸態」上提倡使上海成爲東亞經濟的首都。的確，今後的上海，應從大東亞共榮圈之全體的經濟構想這一觀點上加以運營，改編上海經濟的基礎，不能不在於此處。</p>
<p>過去上海貿易的構造，完全反映出英美資本榨取中國的政策。自外棉以至於洋米，洋麥，外煤，烟草的輸入之增加，及無此入超額不能求得中國工業生產之增進，以及依賴華僑匯款之重要，這些事實，說明了英美的榨取政策如何地阻害了中國經濟之正常的發展，而使上海經濟走上了歪曲的道路。</p>
<p>跟着中國事變的進展，這上海貿易的依存英美性非但毫不减少，反見增加，這表示上海如何地被英美利用爲英美的抗日敵對政策的據點。</p>
<p>現在這從根剷除了依存英美的上海，其復興之途，除融合於大東亞共榮圈經濟中之外，別無他法。而且上海在大東亞之地理的位置，背後擁有龐大的區域作爲原料的生產地及商品的消費地，具備各種條件可爲大東亞共榮圈的輕工業培養地，每年進出船舶達二千萬噸，這些事實，使上海復興的前途極爲有望。</p>
<p>杉村博士曾指稱：「使上海工業與南方資源發生聯繫，在全東亞的經濟計劃上，是不容漠視的重要事件。」</p>
<p>又說：</p>
<p>「如以上海爲經濟基地而以南方經濟置於日方的指導下，則無論在中國內地的間發上，充實滿洲國的經濟上，置在地利上說來，較別處有過之無不及。」</p>
<p>這事又表示今後上海政治經濟的運營，不應任由國民政府任意支配，換言之，國民政府基於建設大東亞共榮圈之根本要求，應在日本的指導與協力下，擴伸上海在新意義上的國際都市之性質。汪主席透切地認爲東亞全體保衛與復興，爲中國的保衛與復興之先決問題。而中國主權的獨立，基於廣域圈政治的根本要求，也不能不受新的規定。此爲國民政府今後運營上海時不能忘却的根本觀念。</p>
<p>（五）第二，我們希望國民政府愼重施行各種政策，使上海的民族資本從遊資轉化爲生產資本。例如上海在今後的國民政府自視爲龐大的財源。</p>
<p>但國民政府似絕不單爲財政上的理由，而敢於苛歛誅求，以涸竭上海的經濟力。日本開放揚子江下游地帶的經濟封鎖，而謀以上海爲中心使物資順利交流，此乃基於所謂「</p>
<p>以下轉入第三版</p>
<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>自第二版轉來分工合作」的觀念，而促進中國民族資本之商業的生產活動。如其國民政府把握上海的政洽經濟操之過急，而使上海資本的活動萎縮，則在中國經濟本身的復興上，甚至在大東亞共榮圈經濟的建設上，將予以重大的障害。</p>
<p>這裏我們又想起了飛　姆論及交還上海租界間題稱「租界的交還，在滿足下述條件之前，不應實施。」他舉出四條件：</p>
<p>一·國內的狀態，改善至使租界不再担心被內及亂。其他外部的危險所波及。</p>
<p>二·「政治重於法律」的觀念，在中國根深蒂固，而實際表現於中國的社會上。故立憲政治應發達至國民政府對自治制的將來租界政治制定組織法，而予以永久的完全的規定，並保其組織法所予的權利之不可侵犯。</p>
<p>三·中國的政治狀態，應改善至地方的自治機關在自己的租界內享有完金的獨立自由，服從國民政府的命令，但不受像現在的國民黨這樣有力的政黨所支配。</p>
<p>四·代表機關的運營，至具有充分經騐而使租租界內的中國人社會，能負責租界政治。</p>
<p>當然，這是十數年前飛達姆氏的結論，我們今日並不完全採取。但在今後上海的運營上，應予考慮，我們不能否定其言之　中肯　。</p>
<p>而上海財界及「上海人」之英美的性格，在此時自亦不能不加以改革，然而同時，對物資統制，以前旣向無經騐，亦無心理上的準備。上海及上海人的本能，把「統制」當作完全反對的近於無政府的自由，把「政治」譯爲完全相反的「人爲」合併起來的「僞字」。然而今後上海的改組，最重要的却是「統制」，根本的難題，就在於此。</p>
<p>以全國商業統制總會爲中心的華中物資統制，以同業公會這自治組織爲基礎而實施，暗示這問題的解決方向。今後在同樣意義上，也總得在新的觀點出發檢討上海鄕幫業的利用吧！目的利急如星火，但方法却不能不繞道而行。</p>
<p>六</p>
<p>總之，上海地再組織問題，可說是建設大東亞共榮圈經濟的中心課題，極爲重要。其成果如何，不僅南方圈各地，恐英美，重慶，也極爲注目。</p>
<p>中國方面應充分認識，日本對於今後的上海期待些什麼，要求些什麼。吳震修氏率直地說：「統制經濟在中國旣無前例，亦無經騐，雖委由中國方面自行負起責任，但仍處處希望日本援助。」</p>
<p>日本之積極的指導與協方，充分予以接受。（宋鴻翔譯自同盟社「世週報」一二一六號）</p>
<h3>新生上海市政設施芻議　上海市民福利協會向市長建議書</h3>
<p>爲收回租界，關係國利民福至鉅，屬會公開研討，詢謀僉同，謹陳綱要建議，仰祈鑒核事。竊收回上海英法兩租界，刻日實　　朝野騰歡，一時千載。收回以後，如何提綱挈領？如何革故鼎新？在政府宏此遠謨，必有以慰天下喁喁之望。顅千慮容有一失，聖言不廢芻。屬會以隱居在野之集團，曾歷訪民間之疾苦，謹就見聞所及，敢爲我　市長　悉陳之。</p>
<p>新舊法令劃分界限</p>
<p>一曰新舊法令宜劃分界限也。凡舊時約定，如道光二十五年之洋涇浜章程，同治七年之會　章程，民國十九年二十年先後訂立之法院協定，及其他關於地方政府與租界當局簽訂之一應契約，均宣吿廢止，同時，代以新法令，如分區辦法，稅收辦法，等，於最短期間或呈請中央，或　以市令分別頒布施行，則民間耳目一新，氣象自臻興盛，是宜設置一法令編審會，由市政府各局處高級官員組織之。以完成爲度。</p>
<p>治安確保聯絡</p>
<p>一曰治宜安確保聯絡也，治安責任平時屬諸警察，自警團員，事態嚴重　則急求軍隊協助，此爲一般通例。自警團　無拳無勇，而朝氣蓬勃，頗足以寒　小之膽，因勢利導，必能日起有功。軍隊協助，義不容辭，而友邦駐軍，尤賴臨時出動，似此各方聯絡，如臂指之相使，治安大要思過半矣。</p>
<p>財政統一收支</p>
<p>一曰財政宜統一收支也。租界捐稅年　三億餘萬，（公共租界約二億外，法租界未見報載或不止一億），而支出之　算，兩租界均未宣佈，決算又須待之一年之後，今旣破除華租分界，上海市區域成爲一個單位，自應改編統一預算。惟西區南市，收入恐遠不及兩租界之鉅、過份挹此注彼，權義似欠平衡，似應酌量增加西區南市捐稅，專指定爲警察加餉之需。不作別用，</p>
<p>民食減低售價</p>
<p>一曰民食宜减低售價也。物價之貴民不　生，舶來貨或奢侈品，可以不用，柴米油鹽，則未可一日缺。政府舉行統制，眞正目的原在平均物價，乃統制愈加緊，而物價愈高騰，不可思議之矛盾，莫過於此。自應多方籌措，如來源之接洽，運輸之敦促，搬出搬入之手續儘量求　簡捷，進口出口之納稅儘量低其額率，政府盡一分心力，人民得一分生機，豈但政體有關，抑亦國脈所繫。</p>
<p>民意相當尊重</p>
<p>一曰民意宜相當尊重也。民意雖散在市井，集體必設有機關，廿六年五月十八日公佈之憲法草案第一百十二條！「市設市議會，議員由市民大會選舉之」。此　遵從總理遺教，雖未及施行，而當茲租界收回刷新政治之際，自應提早奉行，以樹建設基礎。此外如檢查新聞，取締出版，監督人民團體，凡民意一鱗一爪所寄，均應限制稍寬，以集細流土壤之功用。上述五端均屬根本大計，切要之圖。其他工商生產之促進，敎育文化之普及，風化習慣之政良，其有賴於我　市長之集思廣益，高張遠蹠者，寗有遞涘。謹貢一得之愚，惟採擇而引導之，不但地方之幸！實爲國家之福！敬呈上海特別市市長陳。</p>
<h3>桑麻話舊——四老訪問記</h3>
<p>在接收租界的今天，大家在興高采烈的慶幸情緒之下，也許一切的一切都感覺興奮了。回想數十年前關於租界所聞所見的鱗爪瑣事，紀述起來，以當今天慶賀的餘興，不無意義吧？因此，我們事先特地訪問旅滬多年的沈信卿·林康侯·袁履登·高翰卿（姓氏筆劃爲序）等四位老先生，作一次桑麻話舊的回憶，四老異常高興，娓娓追述，爰筆記如次：</p>
<p>沈信卿先生</p>
<p>吾於同治十一年到上海，（時方九歲），旋即返居嘉定故居，未數月復遷來上海，當時交通工具，一如鄉鎭然，祇有小車·轎子·洋人在滬亦甲以代步。未幾馬車·人力車次第出現。當時之鹹瓜街，爲南北交通大道，西運縣城大小東門俱從此出入。過西街即東抵浦江，再南則賴義渡，北連十六舖，尤以三層樓碼頭附近爲最熱鬧，常泊沙船數千艘，帆檣輻輳，行棧林立，烟館妓院，茶樓酒肆，無一不有。蓋由水路到者從浦江登岸，　行必從此街，故成爲極繁盛之區，後因官　保護不力，無賴百般騒擾，相率他遷，布面遂形冷落　囘憶往昔，頓且滄海桑田之感。</p>
<p>現在之愛多亞路，昔稱洋涇浜，由老四門外通至日暉港。浜畔有三茅關橋，在　在之河南路口，架橋於浜上　以利　區　租界之交通　聞家父言，太平天國之　，法人幫助李　　減少　川，三茅閣遂毀於此役　法人乘此機會，　充租界，因此法人予吾人惡劣之印象　深，後塡浜築路，始將此具有歷史性之一三茅閣　」湮滅無存。民國　元三年　世凱竊謀稱帝，當時反對最力者，厥惟國民黨，　設法消滅黨人，鄂黨人　鐵在法租界秘密製造炸彈，被其同伴人誤　紙烟　於炸藥中，以致起火。　鐵亦因此被捕，袁世凱豈求引渡及捉拿法租界政治犯起見，再割十大舖以至徐家匯數十方里之地。以爲交換引渡之條件，昏　賣國，即此可知。現在之法租界，實劉鐵先生之痛心史也。今幸由國府收囘法租界，實一大快事也。</p>
<p>昔時法租界巡捕之服裝，有足令人發笑者，夏則頭戴瓜皮小縀帽，帽項繫紅線大結，身穿靑竹布長衫，冬服則瓜皮小帽易爲膠州金邊毡帽，大紅結仍繫於項上，衣服鞋襪仍與夏令無異，不過靑竹布長衫之內襯以　色布棉袍一件，外更單以外國大衣一件，手中持洋傘一柄，後則變爲天靑色羽毛無領劉襟號衣，袖寬二尺餘，　知舊式之馬褂，又類綠　之　褂，尋常鞋襪無號褲，一任本人隨意著之，此種服裝，四季相同，並無岐異。厥後逐漸改革而臻現在之服式，亦可謂　化多端矣。</p>
<p>上海國人之有報紙要算申報最老，王韜之女婿錢昕伯當時主持申報筆政。王受太平天國之影響，鼓吹革命頗烈，文筆又勁，常投文該報當時最　人心及　誦最廣之　句如：「三皇不足爲皇，五帝不足爲帝，惟我天皇，統數十萬之勁旅，殺十八省之妖魔」，……等語。可見王韜之思想與大膽了。終遭淸廷之忌。遁逃香港，主持報務，後仍返滬，吾尙見之數面也。（陳允熙記）</p>
<p>林康侯先生</p>
<p>類似現在的保甲制度，從前也曾實行過，辦得也相當完密。在每條　街上及弄堂口，都製置栅欄，一到夜間，所有栅欄全部關閉。進出的人必須先經過盤問，祇要是正當商人，仍然可以通行，不像現在那樣一經封鎖，交通全部停頓，什麼人也不准往來了。而且盤問時的態度，也極和靄可親。現在的保甲制度比從前辦得更爲完密，不過，在普通戒嚴時，　想對於一般有身份證的人，負有工作使命的人，似乎可以給予通融，使其不必耗費時間而影響職務。</p>
<p>上海全城分爲四區，共有七個城門，後來又加添了小四門和小北門兩個，現在的新世界與大新公司之間，築有泥城，故今日尚有泥城橋之名，那時候沿新世界以西，全屬鄉村田地，雖也有外人在那裏置地建屋，但究竟很少，所以極爲荒凉。</p>
<p>關於溝通民意的機關，從前有兩個。一是市議會，一是縣議會，晚淸末年，淸廷爲爭取民心，盛倡民主立　。到了民國初年，才見衰落。我很希望租界收囘後，能設一個眞正能代表民意的機構，來疏導當局和人民中問的隔關。（　　熙記）</p>
<p>高翰卿先生</p>
<p>是生長在虹口的，那時的虹口不過是上海郊外的一個村鄉蘇州河畔連木橋都沒有造，行人往來，均在渡口擺渡，有頭擺渡二擺渡三擺渡等處，那時的蘇州河面比現在的黃浦江還要　，那時的黃浦江也比現在　得多，浦西浦東對面是望不到的。從前蘇州河和浦江二岸都是一片沙灘，　草蘆葦，叢生其間，甚爲冷落。</p>
<p>關於交通方面的：黃包車還是近三十年才有的，以前只有轎子和馬車，又過爲數極少，只有高級人士如道台縣官等官吏及外商洋行的買辦階級才坐得起，那時上海的道台權力極大，兼管洋務及海關等事又稱：「海關道」，那時項普遍的算是羊角車了，羊角車就是現在的獨輸車用來坐人載貨，因其價廉，故人多用之。</p>
<p>敎育方面的：在學校還沒有以前只有私塾，當時有一龍門書院，係官費所辦，規模甚大，一般讀書人都在這裏講學，會文，這是三十五年前的情形</p>
<p>我七八歲時，在虹口東鄉提藍橋過去一里路光景的陳家弄。有一個學堂，離我家四里多路，每天淸晨携食就學，至晚始歸，當時的敎育情形，大槪如此了。</p>
<p>道路方面的：從外白渡柵至十六浦有一條馬路，那時，大馬路二馬路，等也有，不過很短，只有外灘到拋球塲那麼長，當時的，路不過是把泥路拉平放寬加上點碎石子和煤屑而已。</p>
<p>三四十年前後，跑馬廳已有了，那時裏面還有小型的住宅房子，墳山公墓，每年淸明節還有人換了祭具到跑馬廳裏而去掃幕一直到現在仍有少數填山不曾遷掉，不過上墳的是看不到了。</p>
<p>那時的上海，市面並不怎樣熱鬧，同現在上海近郊的鎭市差不多，外商的店面，多在　外灘的及大馬路附近較爲熱鬧，城　像九畝田三牌樓四牌樓等地方，市面倒比租界上好得多。</p>
<p>關於公共事業的：我很簡單的都講一點，上海的有電車，還是在二十年左右，公共汽車還要比電車遲五六年，電話在三十多年前已經有了，自來水在五十年前後已有，規模極大，到現在也沒有什麼大變更，那時自來火也已有了，不過只有大的洋商界方用，電燈有了後，自來火就被遭到淘汰。</p>
<p>中國火車的發端，恐怕是上海最早了，五十年前上海到吳淞已經通車，管理火車的事務處就設在天后宮，不過那時風氣閉塞，民衆保守性極重，恰巧上海發生瘟疫，災荒，地方上鄕紳認爲「鐵龍」破壞風水，帶來了災禍，公請當時地方官，禁止火車開行，終於使火車停頓了一個時期。</p>
<p>金融方面的：那時銀錢往來只有錢莊，市面上交易多用制錢，墨西哥銀洋，碎銀子，交易大的用元寶及錢票—就是現在的莊票，—制錢多一千文一串，九百文兌墨西哥銀洋一元。（樂秀良記）</p>
<p>袁履登先生</p>
<p>我在遜淸光緒二十四年（西暦一八九八年）十九歲的時候，從寗波來到上海，入聖約翰書院求學，那是四十多年前的事了，現在就把當時的一般情形後囘憶裏約略的來談一談：</p>
<p>當時上海的南京路多是普通中國式房屋，一直由新世界起到泥城橋爲止，南京路左近的馬路，如九江路漢口路四川路寗波路等都已築成了，而且已有了新式建築物，西面幾條馬路，如新閘路，愛文義路，康腦脫路，赫德路等都是有了馬路而沒有房屋　在　格路　　安　路方面。祇有疏落的幾幢　房，還沒有中國人的住屋，從　司非而路至曹家渡一帶，都是鄕下住屋，　周路那時還沒有。</p>
<p>公共娛樂場所，祇有張圓和愚園，但這兩　也早已廢了。</p>
<p>法租界的市面，那時祇有在大自鳴鐘一帶比較熱鬧，其地完全沒有，外灘大世界，霞飛路貝勒路的市面，也還沒有。</p>
<p>那時兩租界的行政權，完全操在英法兩國人的手裏，租界的司法機　，爲會審公　，（俗名新荷門）其原址就是現在的新新公司。</p>
<p>當時的生活程度很低，米價祇有三塊多錢一担，聖約翰大學最高的學費，連膳食在內，一共祇有八塊錢一月，如果是　會子弟的話，還可以完全免費，所以我在該校攻續到畢業爲止，達七年之久，非但不出錢，而且在這時期內還因助敎而賺到五六百元的津貼。</p>
<p>關於公共租界一般的大事，有許多不甚詳細，因爲其間曾有一段時期囘寗波服務，就以所知道的說一說：</p>
<p>第一，庚子年北方拳匪之禍，因倡言將盡殺耶教徒，當時上海風聲鶴淚，時局極度緊張，後因兩廣總督劉坤一及湖廣總督張之洞，絕對不響應北方的措施，力保東南半壁，所以上海得不受何神影響。</p>
<p>第二，戊戌政變，僅有上海電報局長經蓮孫因起初擁護康梁政策，到了康梁失敗以後，政府下令捕經，但經早已逃逸，所以也沒有什麼影響。</p>
<p>第三，革命時期；因愛國份子鄒容，章炳麟等在上海鼓動革命思想，爲滿淸政府所懷恨，拘鄒章於獄，後來　容病死在獄中，章炳麟拘禁數年後，仍被釋放。</p>
<p>第四，抵制美貨風潮，當時會審公堂中發生一案，有一廣東婦人黃黎氏因美副領事判斷不公，且欲加懲罰，同時有中國官吏　子　被美領事當塲侮辱。送引起了民衆的激憤，發動抵制美貨，首先倡議的是會少卿先生後由英國頜事後中調停。經過了幾個月的折衝，事　方　平復。</p>
<p>其後　中華民國革命時　，陳其美先生任　都督一段，已不必再談，此後爲「五卅」慘案，「五卅」以後，中國人才開始組織了華人納稅會，推舉　　，租界當局對華人也漸漸注　起來　又經過　中國人的奮鬥、此後對於改　中國人的待　，華人也有了發言的權利，這以前，中國人是連說話的權利也沒有的。</p>
<p>法租界方面，在過去歷史中，和寗波四明公所有過一次衝突，因四明公所有一義塚，外墻倒坍了，法租界方面堅持要拆墻讓地，公所方面加以反對，法當局乃用出高　手段，激動了衆憤，　有甬人完全罷市，此次衝突經過數月後，才吿解決。（兪修諾記）</p>

<h3>也算是老上海</h3>
<p>— 張一</p>
<p>我在上海居住的時間零零碎碎，拼拼湊凑，不過十幾個年頭。在小小的生命中，祗佔據了七分之一，可是從開頭看見上海，直到現在，却佔據了時間趨六十四年之久。記得第一次經過上海，我纔九歲，是光緒庚辰，因爲這一年，先君韶笙公，中了進士，授職知縣，簽分直隸　補。於是囘到蘇州故鄕，接眷北上，雇了一雙民船走了三日兩夜，纔到上海。船靠蘇州河的南岸，大約是現今盆湯橋附近，這蘇州根深葉茂河面極　，幾乎望不見北岸，從船上登岸，約二十餘丈。登了岸仍是一片汪洋，稻田縱橫，由小路穿出，突見熱鬧市街，像蘇州山塘或者木凟的模樣，這就是著名的大馬路。我父親母親原要想　盪馬路，但是我和我的妹妹，聒嗓着他倆，定要吃廣東月餅，這廣東月餅，是父親每次由上海囘家，總要帶幾個來給我們的，所以印象最深，一到上海，就牢記着這四個字，父親沒法，就帶我們到了樓盤　，一爿廣東茶館，喝的是烏龍茶，吃的就是廣東月餅，不一　仍舊囘到船上，約摸夜半，母親將我兄妹在睡夢中喊醒，船已離開原處。我們一共五人，多搬到一所極大的房子。糊里糊塗，走了曲折的矮而狹的地方，來到了一間極小的房間，我們不知不覺睡着了，及至天亮，我和妹妹被好奇心鼓動，一層一層的爬上去，豁然開朗，纔繞得這所大房子，建築在水面上，而且是活動的，狠快的在那里前進。正在疑惑，父親亦來了，方始詳詳細細的吿訴我，這叫火輪船，是招商局的「保大」輪，一直開到天津，每一個人的船錢，要十兩另五錢銀子。</p>
<p>過了九年，那時我已十七歲，我父親吿第囘家，又到了上海，一切景象與九年前大不相同。搬下大火輪船，進了一家旅館，在二　涇　的北岸，叫「麥安棧」，因爲父親病重，沒有躭　，　氏船又囘到了蘇州，又經過五年，我已二十二歲，癸已科江南鄕試，居然考中舉人，當時風氣，舉人可以把三塲　的文章，印　出來，上首附載履歷，訂成薄薄的一本，名字叫「殊卷」。這殊卷隨便送給人家，人家多少總要送一份賀禮，俗語叫做「打抽豐」。我於是帶了幾百本殊卷，來到上海，　住在親戚家。這親戚是住在大馬路，記得門首有大字的牆招，「萬康　園」，大約是現在永安公司地位，狠新的三樓三底，租金只有二十四元。承他介紹去見一個年輕的鉅富，混號多稱他黃寳寳，法租界外灘的地皮碼頭，全是他父親的遺產。他收了我的殊卷，送了我二十元錢，不覺欣然。又有朋友介紹了一位吳統領，這統領是一名副將，帶兩營兵，駐在吳淞口。本來上海到吳淞，是有一條鐵路的，上年被御史參了一本，說鐵路是奇技淫巧，中國禮義之邦，豈可任令　　　入　惑民心，這　　　大文，載在「編世文　」御史姓劉名字已經忘记，皇帝大怒，嚴令兩江總督即日拆毀。所以我國吳淞，不能乘坐火車，改　馬車。是吳統領着實優待，並且叫兩　將士凑了一百元送我。打抽豐的結果，收到了將近三百元，居然滿載而歸。但是我後悔得很，當時泥城橋的地皮，每畝百元。倘然把打抽豐的錢，多買了地皮，如今是面　　了。</p>
<p>這幾年來，稍有新思想的讀書人，漸漸在那里私下硏究些算學格致（即　來的理化）編譯等各方面。慚愧得很，我亦算其中的一份子。可是無師傅授，往往弄得走頭無路。我們的寳庫，只有製造局廣學會所出的幾本格格不吐的譯本。如今好了，盛宣懷設立了一個南洋公學，先招考師範生班，我居然考取入學。南洋公學。是在徐家匯鄕下，校址是一家停辦的絲廠，後來的校所就是現今的交通大學，乃是三年後新建的，當時學校左右，全是田地，沒有幾處洋　，星期日跑　租界，沒有黃包車，二把手坐不來，所以大家多是徒步的。在租界上無非到作新社文明書局兩家新書店訪訪朋友，看看新書，如果碰着大雨，脫去衣，或者走現在的靜安寺路往西，或者走西門望南，全是泥濘載　。在南洋公學，住了不到一年，英文讀到文法第三本，讀本讀到第四册，算學却學會了代數，不過是些破碎的學科，便又離開了上海，這一囘雖然比上兩囘，躭擱的時候很長，但是不大到外面，所以見識不曾增多。</p>
<p>從此流浪復流浪，忽然流到了萬里雲南，遇到了辛亥革命。雲南是九月九日宣布獨立，混亂了兩個月，雖然踉踉蹌蹌跑回了上海，可是所奉的使命，却非常重大，乃是蔡諤都督派我參加各省代表大會，來選舉共和國第一任大總統的。記得是陰歷十一月上旬，路過香港，天氣酷熱，汗流浹背，僅僅隔了兩天，一過吳淞口，狂風砭骨，奇寒襲入。這時候的租界，比前大不相同，因爲內地各處兵荒馬亂，有錢的同胞，多往上海跑，市面非常繁華。但是像現在到處多是賭塲舞廳影戲院等娛樂塲所，一慨沒有，所以除了妓館之外，只有一座張家花　，簡稱張　。他矗立在泥城橋　西，兩旁雖然仍是稻田，中間已築成平坦馬路，馬路兩旁，全是高大洋槐。夕陽影裏，車水馬龍，夜間尤爲喧鬧。我那時在時事新報當總主筆，工作煩雜，那有工夫去玩。時事新報，和新聞報，申報，神話日報，時報，民立，是當時的六大報，多分佈在一條望平街上。申報主人席子佩，將申報出賣，我替他尋到買主，以十萬元成交。現在的館址，是新買主移建的。</p>
<p>以後民國十年，我從北京到上海，執行津師職務。二十六年從蘇洲到上海治病。那都是近年的事，雖然滄海桑田，變端百出，見到聽到的人很多，不須老僧僥舌了。</p>
<h3>近十年闤闠舊事</h3>
<p>— 棄潤卿</p>
<p>申報編者，頃以近十年上海掌故爲題，徵辭及餘。自維十四歲來滬就商，旅食於斯，凡五十三年，僑寫時間，未可不云久。然余日常闤闠中，耳目之所觸接，率以本業爲主，故可能憶及者，可以記述者，亦不外闤闠舊事而已。</p>
<p>上海之商業，談者恒以租界爲中心，其實最初商業繁盛之區，原在南市，所謂租界者，亦不過「負郭而居」之意。其後時事變遷，兵戈時見，惟租界一塊土，因行政特殊關係，得爲避世之桃源，因此各種商業，爲避免時局牽動，紛紛遷入租界。即以吾餞業論，最早同業集議之所，在今南市豫闤旁之內闤。其後同業北遷，漸分南北兩市，乃有南北兩市塲，迨廿六年事變後，南市市塲遂無形取消。今者各同業，已全體彙集在租界中　。所謂租界者，已非當日設立時之面目，然造成租界爲商業集中區者，雖由國人之努力，亦未始不由於國家多事，可慨也已！</p>
<p>最近十年，爲滬市商業金融變遷較多之一期。重要之大事，如廢兩改元，如金融恐慌，如幣制改革，均發生於斯時。而上海以本身地位之重要，亦往往爲施行各種改革之首衝區域。故各種金融上之變更，率得於上海見之。</p>
<p>往昔重要口岸，都用國元本位制，朝野間廢兩改元之議，由來已久。至二十一年秋，因水災以後，民生凋敝，始見具體化。而實行兩元統一之日，實在二十二年四月六日。先是三月初，財部正式用部令公佈，規定自三月十日起，以上海規元七錢一分五釐合通行銀幣一元爲一定之換算率，並規定新銀元之一定成色，自該辦法公佈後，銀錢業當即遵辦。自三月十日起，各業交易改用銀幣計算，各種行市亦次第改用銀元單位。不久復由財部佈吿，自四月六日起，所有公私款項與訂立契約票據及一切交易，須一律改用銀幣，不得再用銀兩，其在是日以前，原訂以銀兩爲收付者，在上海應以規元銀七錢一分五釐，折合銀幣一元爲標準。在外埠者，以四月五日申匯行市折合規元再照上述定率計算。是時上海之銀錢同業，亦各議定辦法，先將銀兩存欠各戶，一律按照七一五合成銀元，（銀行爲四月三日，錢莊爲四月五日）。復規定各項票據，亦改用銀元爲本位。此項定率，至今仍適用也。</p>
<p>所謂金融恐慌，發生於二十三年至二十四年間，並波及全國。二十三年末，上海停頓之銀行，有中國儲蓄，五華，中國興業，華東等；錢莊有榮康，益康，德昶，寳大裕等，在蕪湖者，有安徽銀行。在廣州者，有嘉華與南華。至二十四年，上海停業之銀行有江南，寗波實業，世界等，錢莊有同泰，永興，鼎甡等。是年七月，寗波亦發生金融恐慌，錢莊停業者凡十餘家。</p>
<p>此次金融恐慌之原因，包括綦廣，然一般見解，多歸之於美國之白銀政策。以美國收買白銀之結果，使中國存銀大批外流也。當時全國猶用銀幣，因白銀外流之結果，使籌碼大感缺少，後因銀貴之故，使洋貨傾銷，而土貨奇賤。因之百業衰落，而病態疊出。是年十一月三日之實行幣制改革，集中白銀，其動機或由於斯也</p>
<p>今日上海咸苦投機盛行，因此復憶六年前（二十六年）之紗市風潮事件。先是上海紗布交易所之二十支金雞牌棉紗，於五月交割前一日，市價自二百七十餘元上昇至八十元，宣吿停拍。據當時報載，其時上海存紗不過二萬八千餘包，而投機之多頭數，却達四萬餘包，因之現貨籌碼，無法平衡，至是年六月以後，投機者復多方買進，市價　漲不已。至九日乃宣吿停市，十二日以後復吿停市，至十六日方始復業，是役也，實業部且派員查辦此案，而細按之則不過投機家多空擠軋之結果而已。當時物價底碼本小，故數十元市價之上下，已爲一時之注目事件矣。</p>
<p>二十六年以後，上海入於戰事狀態，闤闠上變動復多，然去今未遠，恕不復述。</p>
<p>上海爲全國商業金融之中心，租界復爲商業蒼萃區，雖由近百年國內情形不安所造成，然亦足見國人經營努力之成績。逆料在一切良好條件下，使一切得能自由發展，則我國人在商業上之所造就，當不僅如過去之租界而止。故我國今後經濟上之一切發展條件，當以局勢安定爲第一。</p>
<h3>三十年來　望平街的報館</h3>
<p>— 久役</p>
<p>望平街一帶的報館，要算民國元二年間最多。這短短三十餘年，可分爲三個時期；自民元上溯至光宣年間爲一期，自民元下至事變前爲一期，再下至大東亞戰爭爆發爲又一期，現今存在者三家，餘或改組或停刋，或復刋，或創刋，或遠遷，今就紀得起的叙述之，錯誤遺漏，或所難免吧。</p>
<p>光宣年間</p>
<p>申報，新聞報，時報，神州日報，與論報，時事報，上兩報合倂爲與論時事報，再改組爲時事新報。中外日報，天鐸報，民立報，改組爲民呼報，再改組爲民吁報。</p>
<p>民元至事變前</p>
<p>申報，新聞報，時報，神州日報，時事新報，天蟬報，民國日報，改組爲民報，南方報，大共和日報，亞細亞日報，新申報（非現在的新申報），商報，晨報，大公報，中華日報。</p>
<p>事變後至大東亞戰爭前</p>
<p>申報，新聞報，時報，大公報，晨報，中華日報，神州日報（非前記的神州日報），中美日報，文匯報，新申報（非前記的新申報，館址亦不在望平街，因同業關係，故記之）。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭後</p>
<p>申報，新聞報，中華日報，新申報，國民新聞，新中國日報，平報。</p>
<p>印刷方面</p>
<p>光宣年間，各報用平版機，原動力用瓦斯，版子排就，大樣校畢，不打紙版，即將原版，裝入機上，直接印刷；每當午夜，印機一開，軋臘得……軋臘得的機聲驚擾隣舍好構。後嫌其印刷費時，出報遲緩，妨碍編輯時間不少，逐漸採用輪轉機，捲筒紙，電動力，可把一原版隨意打成條用紙版多塊，再把紙版澆成鉛版，壓成半圓形，裝入機上，即可大量印刷，韌帶出報了</p>
<p>輪轉機須用捲筒紙，捲筒紙又須紙質潔白，後力堅韌，不易中斷爲上選。滬上多各國紙商，各報大多採用加拿大出品，又爲儲備紙料計，量准機件尺寸，寄往紙廠定造，陸續運滬候用，紙版紙以德製爲佳，自大戰勃發後，兩種紙張，均在動用存貨，要是戰爭延長下去，終有用完的一日。</p>
<p>編輯方面</p>
<p>最初，編輯時間，因限於機力，規定每晚十時齊稿，十一時校畢大樣，十二時開印，後來改用輪轉機，逐漸展遲至十二時一時……五時，偶或發生重大事件，經記者調查報吿後，立即擬稿發排，拆去次要新聞，嵌入顯著地位，重打紙版，換裝機上，重印。</p>
<p>各報編輯方針，也不一致，有的重社評，有的重電訊，有的重商事消息，有的重社會新聞；不惜重金，聘用各地名記者是，設置電訊新聞綱，重要事用電報，電訊所不能詳，或次要事件，那末用通訊方式，詳細記載，鑒飫讀者願望，正張義另附小品文字，宜古宜今，亦莊亦　，聊爲茶餘酒後談　，各報亦有每日每週或不定期，出畫刋一次，初用畫家描繪石印，後且搜羅中外各地照片，用道　紙影寫版精印，情景逼眞，更爲讀者歡迎。</p>
<p>電訊範圍廣泛：有有綫電報，長途電話，無綫電報，要算有綫電報採用最早，不過電費較昂，不免爲節費少用，後來江浙各要區長途電話接通，各報租用話綫，每晚約定時間通報，等到有了無綫電報，可收國內電，可收國外電，效用更大，各報不惜鉅貴，購置報機，聘用技術人員，自收電報備用。國際電訊，初只譯述外報重要路透電數條，聊備一格，自首次大戰後，讀者眼光漸注國外，路透社哈瓦斯社，合衆社，聯合新聞社，同盟社，海通社，塔斯社，相繼譯送華文稿，陸續採用，於是電訊網方才完備。</p>
<p>東西報軍，編輯技術，變化新奇，軒豁呈露，最足引起讀者注意力。各報編輯員，見了新花樣，亦得變換舊手法，把從前平鋪直叙，或雨夾雪的陳舊排法，逐漸拋去，代以新式編排，各式大小標題，長行短行擱角等新聞，參差鋪落於其間。讀者心目一撅，爭着先觀爲快了</p>
<p>營業方面</p>
<p>各報營業部，普遍分爲廣吿發行兩大幹部，商業報紙，大都視廣吿爲生命綫，不過欲求廣吿發達，必先推廣發行，根本問題，當然在報紙內容；要是編輯員努力，　了大多數記者擁護，那末，發行自然普通，廣吿自然發達了。不過，報紙負文化使命，非單純營業性質可比的；有種報紙，　偏於商業化，只重廣吿，不重新聞，不免有「廣吿報」的譏誚，其或單重新聞，不重廣吿，那末，何以培養報紙本身生命？要在主持者處置得宜罷了。</p>
<p>其他方面</p>
<p>光宣後，事變前，各報比例負担日報公會經費，爲館方議事　關，雖非法定團體，不過新設報館成立，爲其本身權義計，必辦入會手續，遇有要事或生大交渉，集會議決，公同執行。會內又設有餘社，爲各報執筆人討論議題集合塲所，每間一二週，聚餐一次，藉聊情誼，他若通訊社供給新聞，廣吿社供給廣吿，各有各的組織，因非本問題範圍，恕不縷述了。</p>
<h3>法租界最初的電業，電車和電話事業</h3>
<p>— 顧家熙</p>
<p>都市的繁榮大部是建築在公用事業上，所以都市的不發達也都是由於公用事業的不完備，租界能夠有繁榮的市况，也正是這個原因。上海法租界的公用事業如電燈，電車，和電話經過了不少的波折險阻，和改組才有今日這樣的完美，現在衹把它最初情形的略談談：</p>
<p>上海法租界的電燈事業，在光緒八年七月（西歷一八八二年八月）間，就有上海電光公司，在租界內設備輸電綫路，來供給私人應用，到光緒十九年（西歷一八九四年初，公共租界工部局電氣處的勢力，也　進來，於是被取去電氣營業權的一部分。）</p>
<p>光緒二十一年三月（西歷一八九五年四月）公董局據工程師郡祿之設計報吿，就已決定在局後空地，自行建設電燈廠，供給租界內公用機關和公路的電光，後來於三月二十八日（西歷四月二十二日）委任法國建設部燈具材料保管員勞登，在法國定購機器和雇用電機師。</p>
<p>法租界公董局與英商自來火行所訂契約，原來於光緒二十二年三月十八日（西歷一八九六年三月三十一日）期滿，但因局方電機設備，尚無期限，因此在光緒二十一年七月二十一日（西歷一八九五年九月九日）又決定將原約延長一年。</p>
<p>光緒二十二年二月（西歷一八九六年三月），公董局才選定供給發電機的廠家，而在上海的廠屋，就也招工承造，一八九七年一月，法國電機師卜濟耶到上海，電燈廠的設備也就於五月末完竣，遂於六月一日正式放光，七月十四日正式舉行成立典禮。</p>
<p>法公董局設立電氣處後，除公路上和機關內自用電燈之外，還可供界內私人應用，因此便把各英商的電燈營業權取銷，自行專利。</p>

<h3>我與上海</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>上海，全世界文明的一個大都市呀！</p>
<p>以中國的土地而爲他國人所治理。實爲中國全體民眾的恥辱。今當租界交還之期，申報搬出一特輯，囑寫一文。要寫上海已往的事，上海有偉大的歷史，只怕寫百萬　也寫不盡。曾記得有一時代，上海市政府特設了一個上海通志館，辦理此事，要寫上海未來的事，爲了復興大上海，千端萬緒，也是　怕寫百萬書也寫不盡。當世君子　必能肩任　兩種艱鉅工作，　以衰朽，只能就一點記憶所及，瑣瑣屑屑，寫一點我與上海接觸的小文。</p>
<p>我的第一次　上海，那年是八歲吧！距今整整地有六十年。那一年，吾父親到上海去访友，忽然病倒在父　貝先生家里。因爲病勢甚重，貝先生打電報到吾蘇州家里來了，吾祖母及母親，得電大驚，因爲從　民　非有　重要的事，決不再打電報，以爲父親必然不起了，於是我們全家到了上海。</p>
<p>當時從蘇州到上海，既沒有火車，又沒有內河小輪船，只有雇用民船，要三天三夜趕到上海，因爲日間開行，夜裏要停泊。（倘然是腳划船，晝夜兼行，一晝夜可到。）吾祖母與母親，在船上食不下咽，只是垂淚。以爲父親必是無幸了，誰知到了上海，父親的病，已經好了大半，合家歡愉，不言可知。</p>
<p>父親既是病愈了，貝先生便請我們在他家勾留幾天，還請我們到各處游玩。游玩的地方，我已經不大記得了。只記得有一次，曾坐了馬車，到黃蒲灘去看了火輪船。又看到了四馬路一家　總會（當時名稱。其地在現今世界書局相近。）去吃茶。那個地方前半是茶樓，後半是烟館，中間有許多玻璃櫥，陳列著各種各樣的動物模型，像博物院一樣。</p>
<p>小兒所喜歡的是食物與玩具，我還次到上海來，喜歡吃的是一種瓜輪饅頭，和廣東店裏的大杏仁酥，與冬瓜膏等。玩具全是日本貨。一塊錢可以買一木箱，一木箱中有二十於件，都是很小巧精致的。當時還有一印象，人力車夫（那里不叫黃包車，只叫東洋車，因爲人力車是從日本傳來的。）所戴的帽子，作圓錐形而竹制的，極像我們家裏的醬缸　見了極作大笑。</p>
<p>自此以后，我不曾到過上海。及至十七歲父親故世以後，在十八九歲的時候，我曾到過上海一次，那時內河小輪船已通了，忽忽即歸，也沒有什么可記。</p>
<p>後來我們有幾個朋友，在蘇州觀前街開了一家書店，喚做東來書莊。因爲我們有幾位同學，留學日本去了，日本的地圖，（可憐我們中國，當時連略爲精印的地圖也沒有。）文具、紙品，都很精　，爲國人所樂用，我們都從日本由小包郵便寄來販賣。同時又到上海去販賣新書，以開風氣。（其實上海那時也貧乏得很，不過梁啟超的時務報。）因此我便常跑到虹口日本文县商那裏去，購買物品。又到各書店去搜求書籍，因爲他們公舉我是東來書莊經理呀。（那時張雲博也開一家書店，似名求知書社，我們與之對立。）</p>
<p>其時我曾到上海，考過南洋公學師范生，未取。　隨親威某君至上海謀職業，未成。我家貧親老，靠教書餬口，（十七歲父親死後，就踏出學堂門，做教書先生。）以考書院爲副業。厥後，吾友戴夢鶴君，介紹我到南京蒯蒯先生極能樊掖後進，深蒙器重。那時他正在上海要辦金粟齊　書處，於是我便同王小徐，汪尤中諸君，到上海來了。</p>
<p>我個人正式住在上海，就在那時候起。那一年，我認得了上海不少新學界人。因爲金粟齊　書處，租　在白克路登寶里，我們　子的後面，便是　彥復所居，章大炎就住在他家裏，我們朝夕過從。東面是薛錦琴女士所居，章行　有時也來，後來彥復的女公子吳亞男，就嫁了章行　。</p>
<p>報館中人，我們便認識了中外日報主人汪頌閣，頌閣是汪穰卿（康年）的令弟，耳　而辦報極有精神。上海報紙的第一革命，便是中外日報起。因爲以前申報，新聞報，都是那種有光紙一面印，從中外日報起，用現在的白報紙，方始兩面印了。又從前申報，新聞報，都是　行到底的長行，從中外日報起，方始用短行了。（那時候，時報館尚未開。）中外日報館的西文翻譯是溫宗　先生，（號欽莆，今司法院院長。）東文翻譯爲葉浩吾先生，一大桌，兩人對面而坐。</p>
<p>我又在這個時候，認識了商務印書館夏瑞芳先生，因爲那時金粟齊　書處的書，急於出版，而上海中國人自辦的印刷所不多，我們分頭交商務印書館及吳雲韶印刷所等排印，而我們每天必自己親往校對，爲什麼呢？我們有幾部是　又陵先生所譯的如一穆勒名學，「原篇」等，都是哲理的書，非　常校對的人所能勝托。所以非親自往校不可。</p>
<p>那個時候，商務印書館的規模很小，其地址在北京路河南路轉角。據夏先生告訴我，開辦的時候，資本僅有三千塊錢。我去印書的時候，排字印刷工人，也不到三十人。他們做點什么生意呢？就是翻印英文教科書。那時上海的中國人譯英文，教科書也是舶來品。英國人就把教印度人讀的那種英文教科書，教我們中國人。英國人本來以未來的印度視中國人呀！不過那種書，沒有譯文，當時商務印書館就　有華文，可以華英文對照，就是所謂華英初階，華英進階那種書呀。</p>
<p>這時上海的編輯事業，漸漸發動，還有許多日本留學生，從日本印好了書，寄到上海來發書的。因此夏瑞芳先生頗想發展，但他是一個外行，常常來問我：「什么書可以印嗎？」我常常慫恿他：「你可以增添資本，辦一個編輯所，請一位名人主持其事。將來應出的書多著咧。」他唯唯而未決。後來商務印書館火燒了，大概他保險費是拿定的，上海人有「燒發」之說，果然他添資本，延請張菊生先生爲編譯所主任，一躍而爲上海書業中巨擎。</p>
<p>上海有一個　家花園，也是時代的產物呀。在平常每逢星期日是，士女如雲，聊翩裙屐，恒爲名介狎客啜茗談情之處。一遇會之場了。因爲在當時安塏第那樣的一塊古敝的地方。張聞主人張叔和，是前清一位壞了官的道員，他自己常常在那裏招待。正像陳公　先生在「古今」　　上所說的「一等那摩溫」了。爲了帝　時代　　軍的事，與種暉先生在張　演說。你們不要看了吳　暈暉先生現在有些老態龍鐘。當時一拳頭便打穿演　合上一雙杠木　面。那天那班青年學生，踏破椅子的也不計其數，但是張園主人并沒有一句說話索賠呀。</p>
<p>金粟齊　書處解散後，我又在蔣性栽先生（名智由，即蔣百器將軍的尊稱。）的珠樹園　書處襄理優譯務。　又在葉浩吾先生所辦的啟秀書局襄理職務。這班　書局，都不久長。第一，辦譯書局的都不自辦印刷，連發行也不甚注意。書生不能理財，是其一弊。第二，當時辦譯書處的，以開風氣爲宗旨，本不想賺錢。錢用完了，不能後　便即關門大吉。</p>
<p>我那時仍回蘇州，以祖母年高，僅此孤孫，不欲遠離，然而祖母旋即　　了。吾鄉彭誦田丈，介紹到山東青州府中學堂當監督，以青州府知府　鄉　根蓀先生。明年　又　眷往，在青州府中學校兩年餘，曹根　他調，我也　職歸。其時上海的　人，如鍬楚青先生，我到時報館，會孟樸先生請我到小說林，而我的一生文字生涯，就定局於這個時候了。</p>
<p>我本想家眷仍　蘇州，一人獨留上海，然而有許多朋友，卻勸我家眷不必間蘇州，以家庭經濟苦，上海房租較貴，其他也相　幫，我聽了他們的話。我家庭住在上海，就在這時候起了。我最初是住在愛文義路，後來一度住居老西門，旋　至愛而近路，現在居住在愛麥虞　路，人家說我是三愛主義，所住居的馬路，必是愛字打頭呀。</p>
<p>我初入時報館時，薪水每月八十元，殊爲優待，回想吾友孫企淵先生。早我兩年入申報館，薪水僅每月二十八元，即總主筆張蘊和先生，薪水亦僅三十餘元呀。我在小說林取薪水四十元，僅去半日，那時生活程度較低，我每月進款有一百二十元，儘足敷餘。而且我在餘暇，還可以寫小說呢。然而我一無種書，最大毛病，就是我好作挾邪游呀，辛苦得來，都付了買　之資。所以我的朋友，勸我把家眷留在上海，很有深意。不然，我現在的家庭，　不知作何狀況咧。　鄉父老，往往不肯把青年子弟，單身送往上海，可見得不是沒有遠見呀。</p>
<p>上海的所以如此繁盛，全靠中國的內亂，每逢中國內亂一次，上海就繁盛一次。最先是太平天　之　，大家都避難到上海來了，那是交通還不大便利。辛亥革命以後，諸多遺老也都住到上海來，傾其官囊，買洋房，購書畫，廣其醇酒婦人的生涯。比了伯夷叔齊，槁　　山，自然要漂　得多呀。厥後內戰　多，逃難到上第來的人越多。到了上海，便　著在那裏。不肯回去，於是上海的人口，愈來愈多，到如今還有五百萬人之眾。</p>
<p>上海的惡勢力，爲什么如此的增長，全靠著外國人的牌頭。白相人，魚肉市民。人人切齒，然而敢怒而不敢言。但一半也是上海市民。有以　成之，明明是中國人，爲什么要入西洋籍？明明是中國人所開的店，爲什么要掛洋商旗？明明是中國人自己的房屋，爲什么要國洋行來收租？不用說，原是想用外國人的勢力，以欺壓同胞，降一級，就是要仰世白相人了。我想到有一時代，打官司第白相人的手不可，法官律師，　行一手包辦。當時有句名言叫做「官司　打半場」斤頭，好，竹板敲　，朋分其利，當事人所得，還是微乎其微。我不知道租界收回以後，　種餘毒，還存在不存在呀？</p>
<p>我　　愛而近路的時候最久，有二十餘年之多。那一條弄堂，喚做慶祥里，一頭是愛而近路，一頭便是界路，越界路即是北火車站了，其地是公　租界極北處。愛而近路衖口，即爲一小　場而界路走出鐵柵門，即爲火車站。　含基便利，所以住此很久。然而夜間從望平街報館回去，愛而近并不愛它近呀。有一年，夜深回去，刦去了三次大衣。（上海人稱之爲剝豬　。）第一次，被刦去後，過了兩天，他把當票寄回到報館裏，而且寫了一封很客氣的信。（這封信在晶報上登過。）原來我的大衣袋裏，有人家寫給　一封信。上有姓名、地址。他可以按圖　　，寄到報館　來呀。我便將大衣贖出，披在身上，不到一月，又去刦去了。第三次被刦衣袋裏并沒有信，他也不曾將當票寄回，幸報匯司巡捕房之力，給我到典當裏去贖回。又未到二月，又被刦去了。每一次被刦，他將手槍對準了我，我便生乖乖地自動將大衣脫下，交給了他。　是　不抵抗主義的，因爲他有手槍，我沒有手槍呀！</p>
<p>匯司巡捕房的巡捕　，我和他很熟，爲了大衣被劫，我履次光降巡捕房。他勸我：捕房　領一枝防身手槍，（當時有例叫領。）我們來教你放手槍的法子。我不敢領。第一，我的眼睛近視，掏出手槍來，他倒先放了。第二，我家中小孩子多，不願有手槍。第三，他不過要刦一件大衣，我給了他就完了。他并無傷害我之意，何必開槍打死他，但第三次被刦去很厲害，他剝了大衣，還要剝取裏面的袍子，幸而遠遠有汽車來，他們　　手，然而內衣袋裏一金表，也是愛而近牌子的。已被他　去了。從前我每　深夜，申報館回家，顯得道路悠長，在人力車處，曾　有一句詩道：「愛而路近天涯遠，」蓋而字可件　字　。　下句並未　成。自愛而近牌子的金表攫去，方續成下句道：「一日思君十二時。」</p>
<p>從第三次被刦後，大衣一去不復返矣。其時齊處　兵，巡捕房忙於防范邊境，也不復注意及此。每次被刦以後，刦者就向自己身上一披，以　　者之目，吾內人有點迷信。她說：「這件大衣，過了賊氣，就不要它吧！」還件大衣，是狐皮的，毛身溫厚，製時費百餘元。然而穿了已七八年，典當贖出時，不過四十元五十元。建陽無休止，上海路刦案極多，據說都是從賭場裏出來，財輸了，出來刦掠一回，再到賭場裏去賭。所以賭場與盜賊，相爲因果，賭場的害，不但是製造盜賊，而且也製造子　窮，自殺，種種的慘事。我希望租界收回以後，第一先掃除這個污點。</p>
<p>我在時報館十餘年來，並沒有　過大禍小禍是在所難免。幸辛亥革命以後，江西某武人，帶了手槍到報館裏來見我。因爲那時的報館，室卑地小，大家可以跑來　問。不像近來的報館，巍巍大樓，而且門禁森森嚴呀。在時報館的同事中，前有陳景轉、雷繼興、並子英、林康侯諸君，後有吳幾庵、劉　亭、戈公撮、夏奇峰諸君，都相愛重。報館裏倘然吃官司，上公堂，那末自有我們經理狄平子先生出場呢。</p>
<p>在這一個時期中，我曾到過日本一次，看看他們的報館，眞叫小巫見大巫，深爲慚愧。回到上海後，曾爲了寫一本「考察日本新聞紀略，」由商務印書館出版。（在二十年前，早已　版了。）然而就知道中國自己不能造紙，新聞事業是永遠不能發達的，從來我對於新聞事業，很爲壓倦，我就脫離了時報館。不到幾年，狄楚青先生對於新聞事業，也表示厭倦，把時報館賣於別人，也脫離新聞事業了。</p>
<p>大概要擺脫一種職業，須要一點勇氣。我看有許多同事，擺脫以後，絕不過問，他們都有這種勇氣，怎麼我不能呢？這是我的沒有勇氣，也是我的沒有才能呀。我想第一步脫離新聞界後，第二步即脫離上海，可是結果呢？不是和上海的出版家周旋，便是與上海的新聞界打交道。這是我的習姓使然呢？還是我的命運注定呢？眞像一個的弄蛇乞丐，捨此竟無蛇可弄嗎？會有一度，忽　彈冠之興，到南京政界去混了兩年多，（十年以前的事）。更其沒有意思了。還是回到上海來，做一個市民。</p>
<p>我以爲我的眼睛裏，不會再看見有租界收回的一天了。而竟有這一天，試想我的歡欣鼓舞爲何如？這不但是我的歡欣鼓舞，也是全市民的歡欣鼓舞呀，我希望今後的統治階級，治理這個大上海，至少總要比有租界的時候，勝過一籌，方　對得　　書收回租界的人，方　對得起住居在上海的一切市民。我以上海一個小市民的資格，我深望可以吃得飽一點，住得安一點，吾願已足了。孔子云：君子食無求飽，居無求安。古人云：平生志不在溫飽。但我非敢爲君子，也沒有大志，覺得即此已足。但能如此，我將忍死須臾，拭目以觀諸公的德政。</p>

<h3>淞滬鐵路話舊</h3>
<p>— 沈翔</p>
<p>我國建　鐵道之議，倡自外人，清同治二年五月，爲太平軍事件，英人協助清廷。戈登將軍率常勝軍攻下　山，是年十二月進佔蘇州之際，英美僑滬商人二十七行，聯名請願江蘇巡撫李鴻章，欲　上海至蘇州間五十四英里之鐵道，李氏不　。同時英國鐵路家史蒂芬遜挾「中國全國鐵道干線計劃」遊說清廷。清廷因事　新奇，未予采納：國人亦鮮有應之者。次年僑滬英商再　建　之　。於上海興淞間，建　約十英里之鐵道，惟以咨金難　，僅　手收買地皮即告停頓。</p>
<p>實行　路在光緒元年，英商怡和澤行以上海江　間商務日　繁盛。　自老靶子路附近經江　　　淞口　　軌寬二尺六寸之　便鐵道，歷年一月，總工程師瑪利　挾帶材料，　技師四人由英抵　，著手　地平路，　橋　　，工事進行甚速，至一月二十日是　　，行打釘之　，　一鐵釘由瑪利孫夫人後政府並無阻止之合。一打入，二月十四日，鋪　　達一　三分之一，即出公司掛小機關車名引出者（Pioneers爲第一次之行車，國人往　者達數千人，是爲我國鐵道實現之始訊。　當時官民，　於迷性，　諸新奇之物，十分驚惶，謂　一種魔術，上海道台力道公司停車一月，等候北京政府訓令，引導者）　得重開，但反對者更油然而起。　怡和　路之初，與我國官民約定，動力不用蒸氣，怡和不守約言，用機關車以爲動力，遂動人民公憤，盡以火車通後，勞動者多因汽笛嗚鳴不已，反對更加激烈，地方官吏，亦從而反對，形勢極爲嚴重。績推行線路工程，上海至江淮一段，於六月三十日工成試車。七月一日邀請　人乘坐，三日正式通車，　日往來六次，車價分出上、中、下三等，客車有七輛之多，上海居民，因事　　奇，往來乘坐的固然不少，　一般　民對於火車，　其妨　種種，却無　好　，曾一度因火車公司在江　附近地方督同工人，用竹　圈佔某氏空地一方，引起公憤，將彼處敗粟房　打墊，至八月三日，火車在江　北首往來試車，壓　過路兵士一人，鄉民大恐，於是上海道臺灣　光，秉承北京訓令，照會英領轉筋公司停止開車，英領不允，同時江督沈葆楨旋亦照會英領停車，英領不之理，因之官民對於火車更恨之入骨，積　爭持，結果英領答覆的是：「暫行停駛，聽候英　在烟台與　督李鴻章會商」。</p>
<p>至於現在的淞滬鐵路，是光緒二十二年九月初，（一八九六年十月初）兩江總督兼南洋大臣張之洞援北洋與　軍務鐵路之例，　講創辦吳淞至南京鐵路，是月江督再會同　督王文韶奏請先　淞滬線，　　下旨准許，委派盛宣懷　總辦，工程於光緒二十三年正月十六日（一八九七年二月十七日）開始，歷年六月十八日（新歷八月五日）完工。次日行落成禮，七月十六日，（新歷九月一日）通車，自拆毀　再　，經過時間二十一年，可謂歷經滄桑了。</p>

<h3>上海英租界的由來</h3>
<p>— 樂秀良</p>
<p>一六八五年（康熙廿四年）中國海　開放，上海設立江海關准許外入貿易，到了一七二三年（雍正元年）又下令　外人只能在廣州一港通商，上海遂再度閉港，當時英商對於廣州一帶狹窄的市塲甚爲不滿，曾數度派人到上海從事調查及採察中國官吏之意見，但一無結果，一七九三年和一八〇六年英政府特地　專使到中國，一再提出開港要求，亦均遭駁斥，一八三二年東印度公司又派林特賽帶了譯員從澳門北上，向上海進發，六月二十一日林特賽費盡心機，終於在天后宮謁見過這一次，遞呈了請求書，於二星期後始被迫離去上海，北上高　，囘國後在提出之報吿書上，稱上海是最好的通商口岸，於是英人想開闢上海，以作本國商品，在華北市塲樞紐的意更爲堅決。</p>
<p>一八四〇年（道光二十年），英國在廣州開始了所謂鴉片戰爭，海軍司令帕荀和軍官哥夫，帶了兵船，火輪，及陸軍四千名沿海北犯，在一八四二年（道光二十二年四月）乍浦被陷，六月九日英兵到吳淞口，其時總督牛　督兵　山守吳淞之東砲臺，提督陳化成守西砲臺，陳化成素有經騐，沉着應付，英兵屢犯未逞，遂轉移目標，用飛砲攻東砲臺，半　驚怕束手，偕河南參將等棄冠拋甲退入寳山城，英兵於是從東砲臺登岸，再集全力猛攻西砲臺，陳化成英勇抵禦，不幸中彈而亡，西砲臺終吿陷落，英兵乘勝進攻寳山，牛　又棄城逃出，寳山遂爲英兵所得。</p>
<p>上海城得到警報，退道知縣等官吏都偷偷逃光，商民也遷徒一空，十九日英兵分水陸二路直取上海，沿路未遇抵抗，從經門進城，駐城　廟，幾天後大隊英兵也從香港開到，其時淸政府曾想與英議和，願以三千萬元贖囘上海，但遭拒絕，二十三日英兵又從上海出發參加長江上游戰爭，砲轟鎭江，進逼南京，八月九日，華方便宣佈停戰，給英國議和。</p>
<p>在八月二十九日中國欽差大臣伊里布和書英，與英國全權大臣璞鼎查，在康威里司號船上簽訂南京條約，規定五口通商，開始了中外間第一次不平等條約，同年十一月十七日上海便正式宣佈開埠，第一任領事是巴爾福，領事館錧址在西　家　顧姓巨宅裏面。</p>
<p>第二年的十月八日，雙方在虎門又訂立通商善後條約，或稱虎門條約，有比南京條約更進一步的規定，條約中也只是說英人在上海等五港口何處可以租屋居住和租地建屋，須經各該地地方官和英國領事斟酌當地情形，妥爲議定，並且外人不得逾越，以防地方民民的誤會……</p>
<p>後來在一八五八年六月二十六日，中英訂立天津條約，這個條約亦不過是「通商無礙」的意思了。</p>
<p>「租界」這一名詞第一次見於正式條約的是一八七六年九月十三日（光緒二年）中英訂立的烟台條約，其第三　第二段有「新舊各口岸除已定有各國租界應無庸論，其租界未定各處應由英國領事館會商各國領事，與地方官商議，將洋人居住處所劃定界址」這雖又追認了租界的存在，但所謂租界原不過是劃定某一段允許外人在此地段內居住，等於外人居留區罷了：</p>
<p>上海旣開闢爲英國通商口岸，英橋相互之間和華人之間，務必有訟訴案情發生，關於這種訴訟的處理，便有所謂領事裁判權的規定，虎門條約中說明，——其英商如何科罪，由英國議定章程法律，發給管事官照辦，華民如何科罪，應治以中國之法……這一條，雖未具體規定領事裁判權，但也明白規定領事辦理訴訟的職務，在天津條約中第十六款規定「英國人民有犯事者，皆由英國懲辦，中國人欺凌擾　英民，皆由中國地方官自行懲辦，二國交　事件，彼此均須會同公平審辦，公平審斷」到了這時，英國在華領事裁判權便規定得詳細明白了。</p>
<p>當時英領到上海後不久，便看定地段想設立租界，因條約上對於租地辦法未有明定，英領提出土地　絕要求，因中國法律所不許，沒有定議，後英領與滬道經過數度磋商，直到一八四五年十一月廿九日道　宮摹元才以自己名義用公吿形式公布了。他和英領「依約商妥」該吿示上說……茲體察民情斟酌上海地方情形劃定洋涇浜以北，李家莊以南之地，准租與英國商人爲建築房會及居住之用，所有協議訂立之章程茲公佈如下，其各遵照毋違。</p>
<p>洋涇浜名稱雖存，已於一九一五年塡平，即今之愛多亞路，李家莊即今之北京路地方，東面　認以黃浦江爲止，西界則未明定，這一帶大部份都是已開墾的田地，也有較底之溫地，溪潤縱橫，入夏皆滿生蘆草，這時地價大約每畝自十五千文到三十五千文。</p>
<p>在上述吿示後面還公布了地皮章程二十三款，其最顯著之點爲確定而反覆承認華人爲「土地之主人」，即中國對於土地之主權。中國政府每年領取少數的地稅，地契欲取得法律的效力，須送中國政府蓋印。</p>
<p>一八四六年九月二十四日規定了租界四至，計東到黃浦江，南到洋涇浜，西到界路（即今河南路）北到李家莊（即今北京路）全部面積是八百三十畝。</p>
<p>一八四八年十一月二十七日，英領阿利國和滬道　桂訂立協定，重訂界址規定東南以洋涇浜橋爲界，東北盡蘇州路第一渡塲，西南到周涇浜，西北到蘇州河浜的蘇宅爲止，全部面積增加到了二千八百二十畝。</p>
<h3>上海法租界的來歷</h3>
<p>— 兪修儒</p>
<p>（一）產生經過</p>
<p>自從一八四二年（道光二十二年）鴉片戰爭結束，中國與英國訂立所謂「南京條約」以後，列强乘着此時中國門戶開放的機會，前來訂立通商條約，法國自然也「不甘後人」，接着於一八四三年十二月十二日特派全權公使賴格納率領隨員，帶了兵艦三艘，動動身來到中國，一八四四年八月十三日到澳門，賴格納到後，即與中國交渉，過了兩個月，於同年十月二十四日訂立黃埔條約，至翌年八月二十五日在澳門正式換文。</p>
<p>黃埔條約共有三十六條，第二條說：「凡法蘭西人按照第二條至五口地方居住，無論人數多寡，聽　租賃房屋及行棧貯貨或租地自行建屋建行……各項地方官會同領事官酌議定法蘭西人宜居住宜建造之地……中國官阻止內地民人高抬租値，法蘭西領事官亦謹防本國人强壓迫受租値。」</p>
<p>法國第一任領事敏體尼正式向中國道台提出照會，他先按引了黃埔條約第二十二條約規定，繼說明「因本國屬民呈請租地的要求，依據條約，並曾硏究過應借的地點爲洋涇浜的右岸，由城邊鄕村起一直到將來所需要的地點止，請照別國人同等待遇，即便指定上海法租界範圍，幷派公證人，爲法商雷米洋行估定其所要購的地皮的價値，請即派人會同雷米前往察看地方，劃定四界。」</p>
<p>麟道台經不起他的壓迫，急派人聯絡敏體尼，一方面威迫中國地主出讓，終於在一八四九年一月八日成功，共計租地二畝三分八厘五毫，總計作價四百五十七元零三千七百五十八文，這次租地交渉，經過八月之久，這樣第一個地　業已打定，法租界的雛形，也已經具備了。</p>
<p>這張租地吿示，在一八四九年四月六日由中法兩國簽字換文，麟道台發出實貼，其所勘定的地界爲上海北門外南至城河，北至洋涇浜，西至關帝廟褚家橋，東至廣東潮州會館沿河至洋涇浜東角。</p>
<p>這樣，法租界算是成立了，這時全上海法國人到一八五〇年初止，統共祇有十個人，到一八五二年六月十日，開創上海法租界的敏體尼，終於被召囘國，現在法租界內從南陽橋到大世界有條敏體尼蔭路，便是紀念他的。</p>
<p>（二）第一次擴張</p>
<p>一八六一年五月二十五日法國領事愛棠，奉判巴黎外交部訓令；因法國皇家郵船公司已和財政部約定，得在越南方面專營運輸郵件的權利，因有主要航綫，要聯絡上海，郵船公司需要在上海法租界沿江一帶攤出三十畝的地皮，供其應用，呌愛棠立即進行，愛棠奉令後想起擴張租界的機會，就於一八六一年九月十一日呈報北京蒲　龍公使，意思是說：「擴充租界計劃已到實行時期……最好向北京恭親王方面去進行，叫他下諭將小東門外一帶地皮執行割讓」。</p>
<p>蒲公使准了愛棠的請求，即和恭親王去接洽，於八月一日逕行照會總理衙門，要求令飭上海地方官指明沿河之地約三十四畝一塊，並應由上海道臺速即出示曉諭百姓，書明法國可租之地爲自縣城出小東門隔壁直通黃浦之小河沿爲南至之界……。照會發出後第三日，總理衙門即覆文謂已行文江蘇巡撫迅速斟酌辦理，於是蒲公使便於十月十七日令郵愛棠說：「法租界的南面，可以延長到小東門外隔壁河浜，一直到黃浦江一帶的沿地」，同時附寄恭親王發給江蘇巡撫的諭令，呌愛棠面交道臺，立刻執行。</p>
<p>愛棠更於一八六一年十月二十九日照會吳道臺，請他忠實執行，吳道臺接到照會後，即於次日頒布吿示，承認了法租界的擴充。</p>
<p>法國郵船公司買地的進行，就此已吿成功，總共買得三十四畝，又在吳淞舊法國海軍碼頭買了六畝，後來這地皮郵船公司放棄了，便歸巴黎匯兌銀行和胡塞銀行分別承受。這次擴張，法租界黃浦灘的岸綫，因此延長了六百五十公尺，租界面積也擴大到五十九公頃。</p>
<p>（三）第二次擴張</p>
<p>在四明公所第二次血案發生以前，法租界當局就有擴張租界的野心，一八九八年三月四日，法總領事白藻泰用正式公文向道臺蔡鈞提出擴張法租界的交渉，當時沒有結果。</p>
<p>一八九八年五月十二日法領白藻泰通爾總董白歷謂擬在吳淞開創法租界，請全體董事表示意見，法董事會乃於一八九八年六月一日常會中，對白爾提案，通過一致的意見。一八九八年六月二十二日常會時又決定致函白領事請他從速進行擴張租界的交渉。</p>
<p>四明公所第二次血案發生後，法人遂乘機將擴張租界的願望，作爲具體的要求而提出，當時法方所要求擴張的範圍指定，十六鋪進南，新築馬路一帶，上海縣城西門外一帶，法租界遊西八仙橋一帶，浦東一部份，吳淞一部份，此項提議，中國當局竟於一八九八年七月二十四日在原則上予以同意，到一八九九年六月間法總領事白藻泰與中國兩江總督委員，　應行擴張的租界界址，秘密議妥，訂成節略存案。</p>
<p>這時歐洲方面的英法兩國，正因各項權利問題，發生衝突，所以這次反對法租界的擴張，不是主人翁的中國，英國爲着法國的要求擴張租界，屢次向法方抗議，並對中國政府發出警吿式的照會，中國方面經不起麻煩，乃訓令駐英公使向英外交當局要求將此案移歸英法兩國直接交渉。</p>
<p>英國一再以强硬態度對付，法國終於讓步了，但法國人的外交手段是非常巧妙的，它在環境惡劣的時候，不惜將談判好了的擴張計劃中止進行，以圖緩和英人的空氣，經過了各方面的努力，擴張法租界的事件終於成功。</p>
<p>一八九九年六月間白藻泰竟獲與兩江總督所派委員，議妥應行擴張的法租界新址，訂成節略存案，據此節略內容所載法租界的新界址是：「北至北長浜；（即現在愛多亞路四段），西至顧家宅關帝廟，（即現在呂班路北段及白爾部路）南至打鐵浜，（即現在的蒲柏路，白爾路，棄鹿路），東至城河浜，（即現在民國路西南段），」</p>
<p>一八九九年十二月二十八日法國華盛公使照會總理衙門請迅速訓知兩江總督及滬道遵辦，兩江總督乃派委員兪某和洋顧問福開森到上海協助道臺余聯沅進行劃界事宜，余道臺奉令後即會同福開森顧問等，與法領白藻泰議定新擴張租界的各項條件，事後因白總領事的要求，由余道臺於一九〇〇年一月二十七日頒布擴張租界的吿示，其中所開法租界擴廣界址爲：東至城河浜，西至顧家宅關帝廟，南至丁公橋，晏公廟，打鐵浜，北至北長浜。</p>
<p>法租界第二次擴張又成功了。</p>
<p>一九〇〇年的法租界全界面積只有一千零二十三畝，約合六十九公頃，新增面積爲一千一百十二畝，約合七十五公頃，新舊兩租界合倂起來共有二千一百三十五畝，約合一百四十四公頃，這時的法租界，已比前時增加了一倍多的地盤。</p>
<p>到了一九四三年七月三十日，法租界全部交還，這部分土地乃復歸到我國的懷抱了。</p>
<h3>過去兩租界內的　納稅華人會</h3>
<p>— 楊念木</p>
<p>本年一月九日我國自動參戰，友邦日本隨即發表交還在華租界及　廢治外法權等道義　　，其他法義等友邦，當仁不讓，繼作同樣表示，此項發言事後都一一付諸實施。最近日，法，義政府又先後與我當局成立協定交還上海公共租界，法租界及天津議租界的行政權，從今天起中國將永無租界這個可恥名目的存在而囘復它獨立與自主的本來面目，這是何等値得慶幸的事呢！同時負起「發達租界自治，謀公共利益與平等之待遇」而奮鬥二十多年的兩租界納稅華人會，也已功成身退，先後作光榮的解放。我們在此除對該會過去領導諸公深表敬意外，謹將該會過去小史略爲叙述，聊作數囘租界聲中之點綴，並作將來民衆參政之借鏡，「繼其善者而從之，其不善者而改之」云爾。</p>
<p>公共租界</p>
<p>華人之參加工部局並非起自納稅華人會。錄一八六六年已有華人商業團體等選出代表三人爲關係華民事宜之諮詢機關，不過完全是顧問性質。華人參政問題最早於一九〇六年由虞洽卿氏，正式提出擬組織一華商顧問委員會代表各業公所之權益，工部局董事會雖表示贊同但爲外人納稅會反對未成事實。第二次係民國四年（一九一五年）中國政府與領事團討論推廣公共租界草約時提出，希望在部局加入華董之前暫設一顧問會，由官民選代表五人組織之，此項草約雖經納稅人接受，但從未批准，顧問會之辦法，亦從未實行。</p>
<p>民國八年納稅華人會因反對增稅喊出「無代議，不納稅」的口號，結果次年外人納稅會始准設立華人納稅會並組一「華人顧問委員會」，會員五人，由華人納稅會選任，不過毫無實權，僅供顧問而已。</p>
<p>民國十四年「五卅」慘案發生，六月六日華人顧問會全體辭職，以示抗議。中國官方於交渉中又提出工部局容納華董的要求，折衝經年，外人始改其一向漠視中國民意的態度，意見漸趨接近，十五年外人納稅會通過設置華董三人及華委六人之議案，該項董委於十七年三月正式就任。民國十九年華董人數增至五席，華委亦遞增至九人，以迄於今。</p>
<p>納稅會對會員資格限制甚嚴，（須在公共租界居住五年，財產五百兩，每年納稅十兩以上。）其權力機關爲代表大會，代表共八十一人，包括納稅會會員二十七人及同鄕產業團體各二十七人，華董華委即由此八十一人中選出，據民國十九年調查，公共租界內合格納稅人在萬人以上兩納稅會會員衹三千許，又此三千會員衹能選出廿七代表參加八十一人之代表大會，殊有失納稅人參政之本意，無怪有人要說納稅會充其量不過代表少數資產階級的氣憤話了。</p>
<p>法租界</p>
<p>至於法租界，雖「法租界組織法」中有「總領事商同追台委任華人領袖一人或數人，經公董局認可後得出席會議發表意見，但無表決之權」的規定，但在民國三年我國以八百多公頃土地　權得兩個不能出席董事會的董事之前，未嘗有華人代表參加公董局行政。</p>
<p>在民國十五年國民革命軍聲威尚未到達上海時，法總董特遵照民國三年中法協定之規定，於董事會中加派華董二人，是爲法界華人參政之始，納稅華人會即應運產生。會員資格規定公共租界稍爲合理，並有不識文字，脅業不正，曾受刑事處分或褫奪公權者不得參加之規定。</p>
<p>經納稅會不斷努力的結果，次年（民國十六年）華董得加至五人，並添六席顧問參加公董局。民國十九年起顧問又增至九人，此後納稅華人會便是代表界內華人的唯一機關了。</p>
<p>綜上所述，可見過去兩租界內的納稅華人會實已稍具民衆參政的雛型，不過權力不能充分發揮而且衹代表市民中之一小部份，此爲其美中不足之處，邇來上海設立民意機關的呼聲日高，吾人深望主其事者能爲多方面着想並儘量擴大其所賦予之權力，俾能名副其實，完成使命，全市數百萬市民實有厚望焉。</p>

<h3>From the Reception of the Shanghai Concessions to the Cooperative Completion of the Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>The glorious day we have been awaiting, a glorious day that the Chinese nation has been anticipating for a century, a glorious day in the history of the Republic of China and even the liberation history of East Asian nations, has finally arrived! From today onwards, Shanghai is restored to our national territory; from today onwards, more than four million compatriots in Shanghai enjoy the protection of our national government; from today onwards, there will be no more shameful and sinful "state within a state"—the concessions—within the territory of the Republic of China; from today onwards, the theory of mutual love, mutual assistance, coexistence, and co-prosperity among East Asian nations is proven by fact. We rejoice in today, and our descendants will forever rejoice in this historically glorious day.</p>
<p>For the sake of abolishing unequal treaties and reclaiming the territorial sovereignty of the concessions, we have waged struggles for more than half a century. However, today, the glorious outcome—the reception of the Shanghai concessions—is realized by our friendly nation, Japan, in order to implement its new policy towards China. From the standpoint of our friendly nation and the East Asian nations, this is a brilliant fact of mutual assistance and co-prosperity. Therefore, as we celebrate this glorious day, every Chinese person must deeply encourage themselves, and must transfer the sacrifices and struggles for reclaiming the concessions to efforts in various aspects after the reception of the concessions. Otherwise, we would be letting ourselves down, letting the nation down, and letting our friendly nation down. If we can transfer the power of reclaiming the concessions to various undertakings after the reception, then the future achievements will surely be sufficient to further glorify the nation, the people, and the history of East Asia. This is our most fundamental task today.</p>
<p>How can we transfer the sacrifices and struggles for reclaiming the concessions to various efforts after the reception? In view of Shanghai's position and its actual situation, and in view of the world situation and China's urgent priorities today, we believe that the direction of effort for the new Shanghai in the future has been very clearly presented to us: From Shanghai itself, under the management of imperialists for a century, it has become the largest economic center and cultural capital in the country, while at the same time becoming the biggest shackle to the normal development of China's economy and culture due to its abnormal development. From now on, on the one hand, we must thoroughly eliminate the bad and impure factors in Shanghai that hinder the normal development of the national economy and culture, and on the other hand, we must change the abnormal to the normal, forming a central area for the economic and cultural revival of the country. From the perspective of Shanghai's position in the country, based on its historical and geographical special conditions, it must gradually become a model area in the country in terms of politics, economy, and even culture, using the demonstration effect of the new Shanghai's political construction, economic construction, and cultural construction to promote the demonstration effect of the entire war-participating Chinese region, and further extend it to the whole country. From the perspective of Shanghai's position towards friendly nations and East Asia, given the huge proportion of Japanese residents in Shanghai in the national ratio of Japanese residents, the new Shanghai must become a model area for Sino-Japanese people to cooperate and get along, so that the whole country and even the whole of East Asia can take the cooperation between Chinese and Japanese people in Shanghai as a model to move towards the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>Under the major significance of demonstrating for the whole country and the whole of East Asia as mentioned above, in what most urgent and important specific undertakings should the efforts of constructing the new Shanghai begin? We common people do not talk about profound political theories, nor do we make overly ideal expectations. What we urgently demand to be realized are the following points.</p>
<p>First of all, on the part of the common people, after the term "concession" becomes a historical term, the highest hope for the new Shanghai is only four big characters: "peaceful living and happy work." More specifically, it is the hope of realizing the two points of "suppressing and stabilizing prices" and "abundant food for the people." At present, what threatens the lives of the people of Shanghai the most is the food panic and the endless soaring of prices. After the recovery of the concessions, the authorities can implement new policies according to plan, eliminate the crisis of the national economy, and ensure the lives of the vast majority of the people. At the same time, we should also solemnly point out that only after satisfying the people's demands in terms of food and prices first, and only after making the people live and work in peace and contentment, can we talk about the promotion of all construction undertakings in the new Shanghai in the future.</p>
<p>Secondly, what the people demand is the enlightenment of the new Shanghai's politics. Moreover, in order to achieve the above-mentioned improvement of democracy, and to eliminate all economic crises, it is necessary to first achieve "political enlightenment." To achieve "political enlightenment," one must start with the following things: Raising the salaries of police and civil servants, especially paying attention to the real and practical "raising," guaranteeing their lives, so that they have no worries in their service and are not distracted by life. Strengthening the Baojia organization, improving the ability of general citizens to self-govern, and further promoting all people's self-government undertakings. Only after these two points are realized can officials and people work together to seek "political enlightenment."</p>
<p>Third, we must also especially emphasize the absolute importance of winning the people's voluntary cooperation. The above-mentioned economic and political demands cannot be expected to have satisfactory results if they do not receive the people's automatic cooperation. To demand the people's voluntary cooperation lies in the establishment of public opinion organs. The Standing Bureau had the determination to help establish genuine public opinion organs some time ago, which is something that the people are happy about. It is hoped that there will be factual manifestations in one or two months. We especially hope that the advanced figures in all circles will pay attention to this matter. Since ancient times, our Chinese people have valued courtesy and concession too much, taking asking about politics as a shame, keeping themselves clean and avoiding trouble, so that the virtuous retreat and the petty advance, often leading to the darkness of the political situation. It is hoped that they will not give way to benevolence, and come out to jointly bear the great difficulties.</p>
<p>The reception of the Shanghai concessions coincides with an unprecedentedly important international situation, and it has particularly significant meaning. Therefore, our above-mentioned demands are entirely for the sake of realizing the construction of the new Shanghai, so that it can be a model for the whole country and the whole of East Asia. Japan handed over the concessions in order to demonstrate the cause of coexistence and co-prosperity among East Asian nations, so we must redouble our efforts in various undertakings in the new Shanghai in order to cooperate with Japan in completing the Greater East Asia War. In today's grand celebration, we must especially emphasize that the completion of the Greater East Asia War and the success of the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere are based on the unity of the Axis powers, on the unity of the East Asian Axis powers, but even more on the unity and cooperation among the East Asian nations. However, looking at the current situation in China, how can we talk about cooperation? Only when the politics are sound and the economy develops in the war-participating Chinese region, and we first strengthen ourselves, can we talk about cooperating in combat. The above-mentioned efforts in the politics and economy of the new Shanghai are the model and driving force for the sound political and economic development of the war-participating China. For this reason, we cannot but demand that the whole country, from top to bottom, recognize its own position and shoulder its own task in the celebration. Redouble our efforts and move towards building a new Shanghai to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>The glorious day has finally arrived, and we must sacrifice and struggle for the tomorrow of achieving the final victory!</p>

<h3>Axis Air Force Active in the Skies over Sicily: No Large-Scale Warfare on Land</h3>
<p>Berlin, 31st (Central News Agency dispatch) Due to the fact that the British Eighth Army is in difficulty in Catania, Sicily, and the US Seventh Army in the Barreilmo area has suffered heavy blows from the Axis forces since occupying Jefur, and feels that it is difficult to advance or retreat, there have been no large-scale battles recently. Moreover, due to the large-scale activity of the Axis air force, the anti-Axis forces' actions have been further delayed. According to a dispatch from a front-line special correspondent of the Re-National News Agency, the ground warfare on the Sicilian front has not changed much at the moment, but the Axis air force has become increasingly active. On the 29th, an enemy 8,000-ton transport ship was sunk in the waters off the port of Gila, and the enemy air force base in the port of Gila was severely damaged, destroying many aircraft parked on the ground. In addition, enemy convoys anchored in the Gulf of Guunta were bombed, severely damaging three ships, totaling 14,000 tons. In addition, an Axis mobile team drove to the port of Bizerte in North Africa and inflicted heavy damage. At present, the ground battle in Sicily is only a artillery battle and reconnaissance battle. The anti-Axis forces' operations on the northeast and north sides have all been severely damaged.</p>
<h3>Soviet Offensive Frustrated North of Orel</h3>
<p>Berlin, 31st (Central News Agency dispatch) Colonel Hama, a military reporter accompanying the German News Agency on the Eastern Front, said that the battles in the Kuban bridgehead, Mius and the central Donets River, and the Belgorod area seem to have become more active, but the center of the Eastern Front's summer battle is still in the Orel bend. Although the Soviet army continues to transfer reinforcements, and the tank corps and infantry teams supplemented by Jie are added to the battle, attempting to gain some success in military strategy, the German army firmly defends its positions, remains motionless, and continues to inflict the most serious losses on the Soviet army. In this battle, the Soviet army lost 105 tanks on Thursday, 99 of which were destroyed in the Orel area. Since July 5, the total number of Soviet tanks lost has exceeded 7,000. On Thursday, the Soviet army launched an attack on the south side of the Orel bend, mostly by infantry operations, but these attacks ultimately collapsed in the face of the German army's fierce defensive artillery fire. When Soviet tanks approached the German line, they stood in groups, one after the other, as in previous times. Their main purpose was to insert into the north side of the Orel salient. The Soviet army successively dispatched tank divisions, totaling about 200 vehicles, but were repelled in fierce and intermittent battles. The Soviet army suffered heavy losses in manpower and material. The Soviet tank units that penetrated several strongholds in the German line were annihilated by reserve soldiers. German ground troops received effective support from Stuga aircraft and military aircraft, which bombed enemy concentrations and deployment points, and crushed enemy infantry units with bombs and accurately targeted machine gun fire. A German air force unit destroyed 18 Soviet tanks. German military aircraft bombed Soviet artillery positions, silencing 23 heavy howitzers. The German army carried out powerful counter-offensives in the Kuban bridgehead and between the Sea of Azov and Belgorod, resulting in considerable improvements in the German positions. Many enemy prisoners and a large number of war implements fell into the hands of the German army. In the Leningrad area, the Soviet army repeatedly launched attacks on the German positions under the cover of artillery and aircraft, but were repelled with heavy losses.</p>
<h3>Britain, America, and the Soviet Union Issue Warnings to Neutral Countries</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 31st (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a dispatch from London, European neutral countries and Argentina have recently received a notice warning from Britain that they should not provide any assistance to the leaders of the belligerent countries. It is said that Britain will regard such assistance as an action that undermines the principles of the anti-Axis powers' operations. A Reuters diplomatic reporter said that the wording of the British notice is the same as the notices from the Soviet Union to Sweden and Turkey, and said that the British government is now taking the same steps to send the communiqué on the theme published by President Roosevelt yesterday to various neutral countries.</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Convenes Emergency Meeting</h3>
<p>Sweden, 　City, 31st (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a dispatch from London, the British government convened an emergency cabinet meeting at 0:30 a.m. on the 30th, which lasted for two hours. The content of the meeting is unknown. It is said that the cabinet meeting was very sudden, and most of the cabinet ministers were awakened from their dreams to attend.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Treaty on Taxation of Japanese Residents, the Japanese Embassy Issues a Statement</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Kyoto dispatch The Japanese Embassy in China issued a statement on July 31 regarding the points to note on the Treaty on the Taxation of Japanese Residents in China as follows:</p>
<p>The "Treaty on Taxation of Japanese Residents in China" concluded between China and Japan is the first step since the Treaty of Nanjing in 1842 and the Sino-Japanese Commercial Treaty of July 5, 1843 for Japan to abolish extraterritorial rights that bound China's sovereignty. It first recognizes China's taxation rights, assists the independent development of the Republic of China, and jointly moves towards the path of liberating Greater East Asia and building a new East Asian order. Regarding the provisions of this treaty, the points to note for Japanese residents are as follows. It is hoped that Japanese residents will pay attention to the issued treaty, subsidiary agreement, and points of understanding.</p>
<p>(1) Compliance with the Tax Laws of the Republic of China: According to Articles 1 and 2 of this treaty, Japanese residents in the territory of the Republic of China from August 1 of this year onwards shall fully comply with the tax laws of China. This also applies to legal persons. However, Japanese residents should not be treated disadvantageously compared to nationals of the Republic of China under any circumstances. Articles 1 and 2 of the treaty. The provisions of this treaty are not only aimed at the regulations of the Republic of China, but also at the preparation of the tax system and the completion of various facilities through the active efforts of the National Government. The Japanese side hopes that the provisions of Article 1 of this treaty can be applied as soon as possible, but the current situation in the Republic of China has not yet reached this stage, and there are certain restrictions on implementation. Therefore, there are the provisions of the "Provisional Measures" in the first and second items of the Points of Understanding.</p>
<p>(2) Notification Regarding the Scope and Application Status of Laws: (A) Meaning of Notification: According to the provisions of Article 1 of the treaty, the scope of the laws of the Republic of China that Japanese residents should comply with and the status of application shall be notified by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government to the Japanese Embassy in China (Article 1 of the Subsidiary Agreement). Based on this formal notification, the tax laws that Japanese residents should comply with are specifically determined. In other words, there is no obligation to serve without notification. (B) Publication of the Notification: The content of the notification will be published in the official gazettes of both the Japanese and Republic of China governments. In addition, each consulate will issue necessary instructions on tax payment in accordance with the provisions of the treaty. It is hoped that Japanese residents will pay attention to the notification and instructions and will not misunderstand (Article 5 of the Subsidiary Agreement). In addition, there should be a period of hesitation between the notification and the actual start of delivery. (C) Order and Timing of Notification: The tax rights, tax laws, and the status of their implementation that the Government of the Republic of China should notify the Japanese Ambassador to China are currently being studied and will always exist and will be explained at the beginning. The Japanese people, standing on a broad perspective, deeply hope that they can meet the requirements of the Chinese side, pay taxes, and cooperate with them. To be more specific, for example, Chinese officials may temporarily not implement forced execution such as inspections, seals, auctions, and confiscations. However, inspections of account books and other inspections that are indispensable for tax collection technology, and notifications or declarations by taxpayers are intended to be adapted by Chinese officials.</p>
<p>(4) Transitional Measures by the Japanese Government Regarding Tax Payment: In item 3 of the Points of Understanding, the Japanese government will separately stipulate necessary measures to enable Japanese nationals to pay taxes based on this treaty. That is, when Japanese nationals violate tax laws and have facts such as tax evasion, the Japanese government will consider announcing penalties or taking de facto administrative actions. For the sake of the reputation of Japanese nationals, attention should be paid to these special measures.</p>
<p>(5) Measures for Correcting Dissatisfaction: Based on the fact that Japanese nationals should comply with the laws of the Republic of China, if Japanese nationals are dissatisfied with the administrative actions of Chinese officials (temporarily without the use of force), the Government of the Republic of China may take appropriate corrective measures. The specific methods will be studied separately.</p>
<p>(6) Improvement of the Tax System: Article 4 of the Subsidiary Agreement stipulates that the current tax system center of the Republic of China needs to be improved, and it should be improved as soon as possible. According to the aforementioned Japan, the reason why it set up Points of Understanding and agreed on a certain degree of restriction on China's taxation rights is due to the imperfection of the tax system. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that it will be improved as soon as possible. Regarding the transit tax and other taxes that are deemed inappropriate, the National Government is currently planning to abolish them.</p>
<p>(7) Judicial Measures for Violations of Laws: The consular jurisdiction and other extraterritorial rights regarding justice have not yet been abolished. Under this situation, the applicable laws of the Republic of China are applied in accordance with the general principles of consular jurisdiction and are subject to the judgment of Japanese consular officials. The fines, etc., issued in this situation should belong to the Chinese government (Article 2 of the Subsidiary Agreement). However, if the penalties, etc., in the tax law are still unclear, or if the types and enforcement of criminal penalties differ from those in Japan, it will be difficult to immediately implement judicial actions, and they will be temporarily reserved before an agreement is reached (Item 2 of the Points of Understanding). Regarding this point, the Japanese government does not need to take special measures and hopes that Japanese nationals will pay attention.</p>
<p>(8) Republic of China Taxes, Republic of China levies, etc.: The recognition of China's taxation rights this time has nothing to do with the taxes and levies collected by the Republic of China National Assembly, etc., and will continue to exist. In order to adapt to the progress of taxation in China, the issue of reducing the burden on Japanese residents in China arises. Regarding this point, the Japanese side will consider it separately. Based on the above points, the purpose of this treaty can be generally understood. It is hoped that Japanese residents in China will provide assistance and self-respect.</p>

This newspaper deeply hopes that all the gentlemen and ladies who enthusiastically donate to the scholarship, as well as social celebrities, business leaders, educational pioneers, and those who care about the scholarship movement, will come to guide us at that time.</p>
<p>People in Charge of Grading the Exam Papers</p>
<p>Ms. Xu Xuehai and Mr. Ding Guangxun of the Male and Female YMCA have presided over the scholarship examinations for many years, regardless of the cold and heat, and regardless of the hard work. Not only is this newspaper deeply admired, but also all sectors of society that care about scholarships express their admiration. As for grading the exam papers, all professors who are currently teaching in famous universities, middle schools, and elementary schools are entrusted by Ding and Xu to take charge. They can take into account both the selection of talents and the consideration of the poor. After referring to the reports of each group of this newspaper's review and investigation, they will give the preliminary review and approval. Then, the approval of the scholarship committee will be obtained to ensure that truly poor children, as long as their studies have the hope of achievement and the possibility of progress, will be given assistance to conform to the purpose of the donors. Yesterday, the newspaper issued the report at 7:30 pm.</p>
<p>Review Procedures Strive for Speed</p>
<p>In this session, the students participating in the scholarship examination totaled more than 4,000 in elementary and secondary schools (of which those who have passed the scholarship examination in previous sessions and have excellent grades and conduct in this session have been notified separately to be exempted from the examination). All the grading of the exam papers is extremely cumbersome. However, as the tuition fees of each school are due soon, the review procedures should be as fast as possible. It is planned to publish the list of students approved in groups in this newspaper from the 10th.</p>

<h3>Commemorating the Reception of Shanghai Concessions: Compiling Two Great Works</h3>
<p>The Shanghai concessions have now become a historical term. After a hundred years of restraint, once it is lifted, it is worth celebrating by the Chinese people. In order to permanently commemorate this and for the 72nd anniversary of the founding of this newspaper, we plan to compile and print a book on the History of the Shanghai Concessions immediately, collect historical materials on the evolution of the concessions, and hire Mr. Zhang Yipeng Yunbo to preside over the compilation affairs, hoping to publish it on New Year's Day next year. In addition, under the same intention, we will compile and print a book on the "Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Directory", investigate the content of industry and commerce, and record it in detail, and hire Quan Shi and Pan Jiyao to preside over the compilation affairs.</p>
<p>Similar books on industrial and commercial directories have not been compiled in recent years, which is very inconvenient for industrial and commercial reference. Therefore, we plan to compile it into a special book to meet the needs. However, this work is extremely heavy, and we rely on people from all walks of life to provide assistance, or provide historical materials, or provide opinions. If you have any advice, please send it to the editorial office of this newspaper.</p>

<h3>Shen Bao Monthly, Issue 7 Published Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the Shen Bao Monthly was relaunched more than half a year ago, it has been well received by all sectors because of its rich content and insightful discussions, and the sales volume has increased day by day. The seventh issue was published yesterday. It contains an article by Jitian Dongyou on the possibility of a comprehensive solution to the Sino-Japanese problem, which has unique insights into the crux of the Sino-Japanese problem and is a must-read for Chinese and Japanese people. The publication of this issue also coincides with the time when friendly countries handed over the concessions. In addition to a special article on the recovery of the concessions and the improvement of Greater Shanghai in the future, it also published five appeals from this newspaper on the issue of the return of the Shanghai concessions for the authorities' reference. In terms of international current affairs articles, this issue has Chen Dongbai's article on the British and American counter-offensive and the summer offensive, Lin Yuwen's article on the future trend of the Pacific naval battle, and Germany's high degree of centralism, the reform of the Soviet military and administration, etc., all of which are excellent works.

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>The Challenges Ahead</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Public Concession was also received by our government today! Today's mood can be compared to a school being taken over and run by itself, with the school buildings decorated with lanterns and streamers, and the teachers and students celebrating. However, in the midst of joy and excitement, everyone must not forget the challenges ahead.</p>
<p>The challenges ahead for Shanghai can be said to have been answered very thoroughly at the reception given by Mayor Chen to Chinese and foreign journalists the day before yesterday. Among the various questions answered by Mayor Chen, the economic issue was the core of the answer, in addition to administrative facilities, the baojia system, and educational plans. It can also be said that 90% of the challenges ahead are related to Shanghai's economy.</p>
<p>Among the economic challenges ahead, the price issue is the core of the questions and answers. Mayor Chen's answer to this main issue is that it is the key to the stability of citizens' lives and the reasonable prosperity of society. He especially did not shy away from being verbose and repeatedly clarified it. He first said: "The price issue has been discussed in detail between China and Japan. I deeply believe that it will be implemented soon. I am the executor and will work hard to achieve this goal." Later, he said: "Recently, China and Japan have internally decided on measures to stabilize prices, but I cannot announce them here." This shows that Mayor Chen has already made up his mind on this issue, and it has reached the point where "governing is not about talking too much, but about working hard."</p>
<p>We believe that the main key to this challenge is still inseparable from the two sentences that Mayor Chen repeatedly reminded: "I hope that both sides will stabilize finance" and "First, we must see if there is a way to manage currency", because other measures to suppress and stabilize prices, no matter how effective they are, are only superficial.</p>
<h3>Various Industry Associations Implement Emergency Measures to Manage the Industry to Assist the Authorities in Suppressing the Rising Prices</h3>
<p>Since the reorganization of the various industry associations under the Business Coordination Association, after several weeks of rectification, almost all of them have entered the right track as of yesterday. According to reporters from Datong News Agency who inquired from various industry associations, from today onwards, emergency measures will be implemented to manage the prices of the same industry, so as to assist the municipal authorities in suppressing the rising prices and maintaining the stability of people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>Eliminate Barriers and Gain Understanding</p>
<p>According to reports, the authorities of the various industry associations felt that they did not have a good understanding of the business conditions of the same industry, so there were inevitably barriers between the industry associations and their members. After active investigation last month, as of now, they have a deep understanding and have discussed strict measures to implement emergency measures to manage the prices of the same industry.</p>
<p>Emergency Measures to Suppress Prices</p>
<p>According to reporters from Datong News Agency, the measures include the following: (1) Establish an investigation team to thoroughly investigate illegal trade in the same industry. (2) The industry association will start direct contact with the authorities controlling materials. The content of the contact will not be revealed, but suppressing prices will be inevitable. (3) After the unification of the authorities' agencies in the various districts of this city, the prices of the stores operated by the members of the same industry will be unified as much as possible. (4) The distribution situation of materials will be made public every time. (5) The quantity of inventory, transaction scope, and the names of the parties involved of the members of the same industry will be reported to the authorities by the industry association.</p>
<h3>Establishment of Japanese Cotton Association</h3>
<p>The Jiangbei Cotton Association, reorganized from the Japanese Cotton Collection Association, held an establishment meeting at the Japanese Club at 2 pm on the 30th. Fourteen related companies attended. In addition to passing the articles of association, responsible personnel were elected on the spot.</p>
<p>Content of the Articles of Association</p>
<p>The reporter from Guofeng News Agency specially selected the main contents of the association's articles of association as follows: (1) The association's business includes the purchase and transportation of Jiangbei cotton, the cultivation and production increase and quality improvement of cotton, and the statistical investigation and research on cotton. (2) The association is composed of 14 cotton companies that are members of the Shanghai Japanese Cotton Traders Association. (3) The total amount of funds is 100 million yuan, and capital may be increased if necessary.</p>
<p>List of Directors and Supervisors</p>
<p>The elected directors and supervisors of the association are as follows: (1) Standing Director, Mori Goro, (2) Directors, Ryogawa Takashi, Okabayashi Hiroshi, Akiyama Takeo, Fujii Shinjirou, Kurimoto Toraji, Uematsu, (3) Supervisors, Kodama Choijirou, Noguchi Masahiro.</p>
<h3>Purchase of Stamp Duty by Stores Promoted by Various Industry Associations</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Stamp Tax Bureau of Tobacco and Alcohol believes that the stamp tax administration in the two special districts of Shanghai has been adjusted and the promotion system has been adjusted repeatedly, but it has not been promoted smoothly due to the special administrative relations of the concessions. There are countless cases of compliance and violation, or failure to purchase and affix stamp tax tickets in accordance with regulations, which has greatly affected the sales volume. Now that the two concessions have been returned and received one after another, the merchants should be strictly ordered to purchase and affix them in accordance with regulations. In order to unify the sale of flowers and prevent the malpractice of missed stickers, it is specifically stipulated that from August 1, the stamp promotion system will be changed to be promoted collectively by the various industry associations. The bureau also ordered the various industry associations to list the total amount required by the member stores of each industry from August 1, and report it to the Bureau. It is said that in the past, the stamp sales volume in the two concession areas reached about 400,000 yuan per month. After this change in the promotion system, the sales volume can still be increased.</p>
<h3>Materials Adjustment Committee Denies Checking Finance</h3>
<p>The Materials Investigation Committee has now reported the materials of each warehouse that have been investigated and are under review. Plans for strengthening the investigation work in the future are also being studied. Regarding the implementation of financial inspection, the person in charge of the committee said: On the 26th of this month, the Japanese-language Continental News published a message about the Materials Investigation Committee, which, in addition to recording the proceedings of the second committee meeting, also suggested "the implementation of financial inspection" and cited past facts as a kind of hope. However, when the Chinese newspapers reprinted the message the next day, the title "The Materials Investigation Committee will implement financial inspection" was quite different from the original meaning, and the financial inspection has its own competent authority responsible for handling it, which is not within the scope of the committee's functions. When it is necessary to conduct an investigation, measures such as checking the company or warehouse accounts cannot be equated with financial inspection. The number of inventory quantities in each warehouse that has been checked is still under review, and the numbers provided by the counties are not credible. The powers of the investigators have now been clearly stipulated in the Investigator Service Regulations, and all measures are based on the law, which is also the basic belief of the committee.</p>
<h3>Trend of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks rose in a volatile manner, and many new highs appeared again. The goals of all parties were concentrated, old investors held on, and new buyers increased day by day. The trend was easy to rise and difficult to fall. According to the hearts of all parties, they are still mostly prosperous. Although it was Saturday, the transaction was strong. Wing On Co. in the department store industry stood out among the eight, and Sincere and China Emporium also followed suit. The increase in underwear was even greater, and two consecutive leaps were made. Jingfu Shirts and Socks saw a new high price again, but Jinglun was relatively stable. The buying momentum of Kwong Wah and China Emporium has not diminished. Wing On Textile in the textile industry finally leveled with the previous day after fatigue. Small ticket textiles such as New China, Hong Sheng, Kwok Kwong, Kwok Sun, Chun Fung, Yan Fung, Da Chung Hwa, Mei Lun, Wing Fung, and Sincere all made progress. The rise of Dasheng Factory One and Three was even more amazing. There were very few sellers in the cultural industry, and there was a lack of transactions. Commercial Press, Chung Hwa, and World Book Co. each rose by dozens of dollars, all seeing high prices. New Asia in the new medicine industry rose by several yuan compared with the previous day. Five Continents, Sino-Foreign, and Sincere Pharmacy were called for even higher prices. The price of Shanghai North Water and Electricity and China Electric Company in the public utility industry was stable, while the latter suddenly knocked on three levels. Investors poured into industrial stocks. Kiu On Industrial stood out among the eight levels. The rising momentum of Da Chung Hwa Industrial was intensified, and the buying price of China Investment was getting higher day by day. San Lok Industrial, which had no color, was also gradually being asked about by investors. The price exceeded 50% of the ticket price. New Asia Construction rose by several yuan again. The pulling momentum of Lien Hwa and Sin Yick Real Estate did not stop. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company was stable. Da Chung Hwa Matches suddenly reported flatness and fatigue. Hong Yuan Biscuit soared and saw speed. Standard Wei Jing. Fuk Man Dairy and Gee Mei Food all crossed the border in the buying momentum. There were also many entries for Standard Paper. Jin Hua Paper knocked on three levels again. Da Hwa Pulp had news of increased capital, and it was also the focus of buyers. Shanghai Rickshaws rose by 60% over the ticket price. China United Shipbuilding, China Bricks and Tiles, Wah Fung Enamelware, and Chung Hing Timber were all strong and lasting. The price of China Transport Film rose again.</p>
<h3>Business Summary</h3>
<p>Gold and Silver: Yesterday, the Dasing Tongxing Jewelry Firm in Shanghai was still at a standstill. There were few transactions outside the industry, and the hearts of the people were bewildered, so the price was also uncertain. At noon, it was slightly smaller than the previous day, and silver exceeded the customs.</p>
<p>Public Bonds: The transaction of unified public bonds was not strong, and both buyers and sellers were watching. A, B, D, and E all rose slightly, and only C was flattened.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth: The market was still weak due to the hearts of the people, and because the supply exceeded the demand, the price gradually fell. As a result, it was lower than yesterday. The number of the leading fine cloth was reduced by half a hundred, and it has entered the eighth level. The four gentlemen also fell by a yuan. There was no change in the spot price of the peach blossom lady. The three sheep and the Green Jade books were tired. There was no market for cotton yarn.</p>

<h3>Talking About Suppressing Speculation and Stabilizing Prices</h3>
<p>— Shu Ren</p>
<p>(2) Restrict the use of telephones: In the era of controlled economy, all material resources must be saved as much as possible. Since the development of the speculative market in Shanghai, the use of telephones has increased alarmingly. Just listen, the price of a telephone secretly sold is 5,000 to 10,000, which can be seen in general. The authorities have banned publications from publishing news about prices. Why can't they restrict the use of telephones, so that speculators lose their sight and hearing and slightly restrain their actions, which saves material resources and severely hits speculators. Some say that this method hinders the development of industry and commerce, but picking up the phone and waiting for 10 or 20 minutes without getting through, is it the blessing of the industry and commerce circles?</p>
<p>(3) Freeze materials: Regarding material control, the authorities have various concrete methods. I advocate further sanctioning private hoarding. Check the warehouses for private hoarding, order the companies to investigate the truth to prevent individuals from borrowing names; restrict the transfer of stack slips to prevent private transactions; reward reporting; prohibit manufacturers from selling huge amounts of goods to individuals. Manufacturers hoarding non-business goods are prohibited. The raw material inventory of factories and stores is frozen uniformly, and strictly handled to prevent evasion. Factories need to apply for approval to use materials, depending on whether the products they produce are necessary. If the products do not have a retail department for sale, the factory must immediately allocate them to another seller for public consumption. Factories are not allowed to deliberately stop work in order to maintain raw materials. If some manufacturers lack raw materials, the authorities can requisition them from other places and supply them at a fair price. Stores sell goods, and the authorities approve a certain amount every day to save consumption and eliminate back-door transactions, so that they cannot refuse to sell. The profit of buying and selling is in the store, and the right to sell is in the authorities, so the strange phenomena such as exceeding the price limit and having prices but no goods can be eliminated.</p>
<p>Before the implementation of full rationing of all daily necessities, the above three points can be used as a temporary solution. (End)</p>
<h3>Supplementing the Lack of People's Food, Miscellaneous Grains Continue to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Recently, in order to supplement the shortage of people's food in this city, the military distribution combination has been purchasing miscellaneous grains from various producing areas and transporting them to Shanghai. Thousands of packages of beans have been shipped from Chongming Wangdian and other places, and have been handed over to miscellaneous grain companies for public sale at fair prices. The price is 450 yuan per 100 catties for the first class, 420 yuan for the second class, 400 yuan for the third class, and 380 yuan for the fourth class. All the actual sales households and miscellaneous grain firms in this city can go to purchase them.</p>

<h3>Thoughts and Hopes on the Return of the Shanghai Concessions</h3>
<p>We are publishing a special issue to celebrate the return of the Shanghai concessions, and we solicited insightful articles under the title "Thoughts and Hopes." We are extremely pleased to have received contributions from both Chinese and Japanese individuals. We are now publishing the first four articles, namely those by (1) Mr. Bodo, (2) Mr. Akahoshi Tamemitsu, (3) Mr. Wu Kaisheng, and (4) Mr. Li Quanshi. We would like to express our gratitude to the authors.</p>
<p>—Editor's Note</p>
<p>Article 1: Bodo</p>
<p>The Shanghai International Settlement was a key port for Anglo-American aggression against China. What kind of impression it gave the Chinese people over the past century, and how Chinese people and patriots planned to recover it with painstaking efforts, need not be elaborated upon. In short, once this stronghold, which they relied on, is returned, China's sovereignty will be complete, which is indeed a cause for celebration. It is important to be wary of recklessly speculating on the Japanese side's intention to return the concessions or of harboring excessive concern about the international situation. This war has reached a point of no return and is tied to the survival of the nation. Past peace conferences will not be repeated. Everything will depend on victory, and this war must be won. Victory is now being achieved step by step. The Chongqing side has long lost its reason to stubbornly resist the war due to these new facts. It is puzzling why they are still resisting Japan for the sake of peace!</p>
<p>What I most fervently hope for is the economy of Shanghai after the return of the concessions. If the return of the concessions is used as an opportunity to pursue and protect one's own interests, disregarding national prestige and the welfare of the people, it should be unanimously condemned by the Chinese people. It would also undermine credibility with friendly nations and ultimately benefit the enemy. While celebrating the return of the concessions, I secretly hope that the Shanghai concessions, which have long been under the influence of British and American powers, will redouble their efforts and achieve several times the development, transforming it into a region where people from all nations can live and work in peace and contentment, once it is returned to Chinese rule.</p>
<p>Looking back, Britain launched the Opium War against China a century ago, culminating in the forced signing of the Treaty of Nanjing. This treaty was the beginning of the infringement upon China's territorial sovereignty. It was followed by the cession of Hong Kong Island, the opening of Shanghai and other five ports for trade, and the establishment of concessions, which led to China's subjugation to foreign powers. This was the root cause. Over the next century, various movements arose in China, such as the Boxer Rebellion, the Reform Movement led by Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, the Xinhai Revolution, and Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism. All of them firmly advocated overthrowing imperialism and abolishing unequal treaties. In the subsequent National Revolution, this advocacy was even more intense, and it served as a rallying cry for the rise of southern China, ultimately unifying the country. This was an unprecedented event in Chinese history. Unfortunately, as the years passed, the National Government gradually erased its original advocacy and willingly submitted to the protection of British and American imperialism, which led to the Sino-Japanese Incident.</p>
<p>When the Sino-Japanese Incident occurred, the anti-Japanese faction supporting Chiang Kai-shek shouted for the preservation of territorial sovereignty and the independence of the nation, stubbornly resisting Japan to this day. As a result, vast territories in North China, Central China, and South China have been lost, and no cultural and industrial areas remain. They can only flee to the frontier and remain in Sichuan to survive. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the so-called Chongqing regime lost its reason for existence and its rationale for resisting Japan. Their resistance can no longer be said to be for the protection of China's territory and nation, but has become an appendage of Britain and the United States, ultimately sacrificing itself for their interests. On the other hand, Japan has swept away British and American forces from China and other regions of Greater East Asia, where they had been entrenched for nearly a century, and is looking forward to the awakening and rise of the East Asian nations to jointly achieve the goal of this war. The Nanjing National Government, in order to implement the spirit of living and dying together, and to achieve sincere cooperation with Japan, resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States. All of this is inevitable and justified. In addition, Japan, in order to share the responsibility of jointly defending East Asia, and to assist in China's autonomy and independence, and to make it more prosperous, returned the Japanese exclusive concessions in the North and South and the Beijing Legation Quarter and the Xiamen Gulangyu Concession one by one. Now, the most advanced bridgehead of British and American aggression against our East Asia, namely the Shanghai International Settlement, has also been officially returned on August 1, which also shows Japan's sincerity in Sino-Japanese relations.</p>
<p>Article 2: Akahoshi Tamemitsu</p>
<p>On January 9 of this year, when the National Government declared its participation in the war, the Japanese government announced on the same day the return of the Shanghai International Settlement. After half a year, on June 30, detailed agreements were announced, and preparations for the transfer were carried out between the Municipal Government and the Public Works Bureau. It has been decided that on August 1, the International Settlement will be taken back by the National Government, truly restoring it to Chinese sovereignty. Furthermore, the French government also declared on February 23 of this year that it would relinquish its privileges in China and implement the return of the three French exclusive concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou. Subsequently, on July 21, the Chinese and French authorities decided on the detailed terms for the return of the Shanghai French Concession, and it was decided that the National Government would take it back on July 30. Considering that a century ago, the Opium War led to the conclusion of the Treaty of Nanjing, which gave rise to the British and American base for exploiting China—the International Settlement—and the French Concession, which France obtained in 1849 based on the Sino-French Treaty by imitating the British and Americans, these will no longer exist within Chinese territory. From August 1, a new municipal administration will be implemented under the sovereignty of the National Government. This glory is the result of the four hundred million Chinese people's efforts to realize this long-cherished wish by enduring hardship and humiliation, sweeping away a century of shame from China, and restoring China's complete independence. This is truly a joyous event of the century. It adds a glorious page to China's four thousand years of history. For example, when parents lose a beloved child, only parents can know the sorrow. Only Japanese people who have suffered from foreign extraterritoriality and land leases can understand the joy of the Chinese people today. Even I, the author, feel "extremely happy" and cannot help but feel infinite gratitude and excitement in my heart.</p>
<p>The China Incident occurred due to misunderstandings between China and Japan, which is certainly unfortunate for both countries and for East Asia as a whole. Both China and Japan must bear the responsibility for this misunderstanding. However, the misunderstanding has been dispelled between China and Japan after the Konoe Statement and Chairman Wang's response to the Konoe Statement's Yan telegram. This misunderstanding eliminated the reason for China's resistance against Japan. Subsequently, Chairman Wang advocated and formed a relationship based on the idea of ​​common existence and common death, with equality and mutual benefit between China and Japan. The Japanese National Government participated in the Greater East Asia War, taking Britain and the United States as enemies, and allied with Japan to fight together for the liberation of East Asia. However, the Chongqing regime still relies on Britain and the United States, continuing its unreasonable resistance. In short, this contradiction is because the Chongqing regime is located in the interior of Sichuan, and Japan's true intentions cannot be conveyed. There is no opportunity to face the new situation in which China and Japan are connected to morality. Therefore, it is still misunderstood. Chairman Wang is Chinese, and Chiang Kai-shek is also Chinese. Both are from Eastern morality. One day, this misunderstanding will also disappear. It is believed that on this day, both Nanjing and Chongqing will treat this joyous event of the century for China, no, it must be a joyous event for the entire East Asia. From the perspective of Japanese feelings, I cannot help but express my deep sympathy for this great event in Chinese history, namely the so-called recovery of the concessions, which occurred at the most unfortunate time for China. This is because I have a deep understanding of his joy, not as someone else's business, but as my own business and rejoice.</p>
<p>Recently, I saw a lot of writing about new policies toward China. This is really a mistake of true policy. The return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights were decided as early as the Konoe Statement. This can be considered the basic policy of Japan's true policy toward China. Therefore, the new policy should be called the true policy. According to the three principles of Konoe, it is the most obvious expression of Japan's true policy toward China. Understanding the so-called sacred decree of the Eight Corners of the World is the belief and concept of the Japanese people. Today, it can be said that we have reached the opportunity to specifically implement its policies. In the past, Japan had to confront the British and American forces in order to protect East Asia. When Britain and the United States invaded China and East Asia became active, Japan's national power had not yet reached the youth stage. Instead of being unable to use force to resist these powerful countries, it is better to cultivate its own national power and reserve it for future use. Due to the need to confront the British and American forces, the means of cultivating national power is of course. If the great powers acquired concessions in China, Japan would naturally want them too. This means of confrontation by Japan is outwardly taking the form of aggression, and in fact it should frankly admit that it contains the content of aggression against China. However, the purpose has always been to confront Britain and the United States. It is nothing more than a means to enhance its own national power, and its essence is very different from that of Britain and the United States. However, China's misunderstanding of Japan arose from this, which is undeniable. The growth of Japan's national power led to war with Britain and the United States. Now Japan and its allies are devoting all their national power to the liberation of East Asia and the establishment of the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere, and are advancing toward the completion of the Greater East Asia War. The power of Britain and the United States in East Asia has been destroyed. Now Japan has been able to sweep away the opposing forces of Britain and the United States in China. Moreover, Japan has reached the prime of its national power. It does not need to imitate the piracy of the British and Americans in occupying concessions. Even for the occupied areas of Burma and the Philippines, which the loyal Japanese soldiers exchanged for blood, it declared its assistance to its independence in the status of friendly countries. This is the most powerful proof.</p>
<p>Japan's policy toward China, to put it realistically, is a policy toward Britain and the United States. Compared with the past policy toward China, the goal has been completely transformed due to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and it is rushing toward the real goal. Therefore, the policy toward China has been reduced from the means of confronting Britain and the United States to Japan's original moral policy. This is a natural result. Japan's original way is to restore the new policy toward China. The return of concessions, which has the greatest significance, is the first step in its concrete realization. The abolition of extraterritorial rights is also of course. Only in this way can it be regarded as the original face of Japan's true policy toward China, in which there is no strategy, no plan, and no intention to plan for oneself. China's recovery of this concession, Japan has no conditions or requirements for the National Government. The reason why it is resolutely implemented is nothing more than to express the original face of Japan's true policy toward China. However, there is still a little regret that this opportunity happened to be at a time when the Greater East Asia War was more intense. I hope that everyone will not be misled by the enemy's counter-propaganda that provokes relations between China and Japan, and distort the judgment of Japan's true intentions, and insults the efforts of the 400 million Chinese people for many years. Japan's true policy toward China, from the abstract theory to the realization stage today, people who have only seen and heard Japan's policy toward China in the past, I am afraid that no one will believe it; it has developed so fast, perhaps some Japanese people will doubt it. Perhaps it is Japan's policy of retreat, or it may be a policy of giving up the name in exchange for profit. These are all critical misunderstandings. We must know that Japan is now independent and can win the Greater East Asia War, possessing abundant combat power and having the determination of iron and stone. This fact has been repeatedly explained by the leaders of Japan, and there are concrete facts to prove it. In any part, there is absolutely no need to express a policy of retreat. The purpose is still to ensure the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of the National Government, and to eliminate the concessions and extraterritorial rights that have hindered its national strength and domestic unity, so as to help it strengthen itself and achieve the purpose of participating in the war. The Japanese government has overcome all difficulties and expressed this true policy toward China with facts. This is a major test for China and the Chinese people. The way China and the Chinese people respond to this sincerity with a Japanese attitude can be regarded as a major key to maintaining Sino-Japanese relations in the future.</p>
<p>I am neither an archaeologist nor a lover of statistics, and because I am too busy with my affairs. So I don't want to collect any writing materials from ancient books, I just write this article as a reflection of what I thought about in advance. Neither intentional nor malicious, I will leave it here. (Translated by Yunpeng)</p>
<p>Article 3: Wu Kaisheng</p>
<p>Since our country was tempted by British and American imperialism and implemented the Open Door Policy, the national power has declined day by day. Especially after the defeat in the Sino-British Opium War in 1843, Britain, the United States and other countries successively imposed various unequal treaties on our country, making our bright and great history stained with mottled shameful bloodstains, and the vast territory was dotted with the nests of great powers invading our country's sovereignty—concessions. The poison has lasted for a hundred years, causing our country to become a semi-colony.</p>
<p>Seeing that the existence of the abnormal concession system is a huge disaster that invades our country's sovereignty and hinders the survival and development of the nation, the founding father Sun Yat-sen had long been determined to abolish unequal treaties in order to seek China's freedom and liberation. After the Revolution of 1911 was completed, the Manchu Qing Dynasty was overthrown and the Republic of China was established. However, British and American imperialism still used some exiled politicians and remnants of warlords to take advantage of the situation, using the concessions as a talisman, creating troubles, harming the country and the people, and doing all kinds of evil. For thirty years, internal strife has been frequent, and the country is almost not a country. Although people with lofty ideals in the country have repeatedly thought about working hard to recover the concessions, they have failed to achieve their goals due to the obstruction of Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Since the National Government declared its participation in the Greater East Asia War on January 9 this year, the friendly country Japan first declared its abolition of extraterritorial rights in China with a spirit of morality, and successively returned the Japanese-exclusive concessions in various places to the National Government. This sincere expression has deeply moved people all over the country. Later, the French government also did not give way, and automatically declared on February 23 that it would return the concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights. On March 29 this year, it exchanged notes with our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to abandon administrative power in the Beijing Legation District. On April 8 this year, they exchanged notes on abandoning the administrative power of the Gulangyu Public Concession, and on May 18 this year, they signed an agreement on the implementation details of the return of the administrative power of the French Concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangdong, and officially took over on June 5. On June 30, after China and Japan signed the return of the Shanghai Public Concession, at the same time, representatives of China and France, under the mediation of friendly countries, devoted themselves to the return of the Shanghai French Concession. After repeated consultations and the best efforts of friendly countries, it was successfully completed and officially signed in the capital on July 22.</p>

<p>It was decided to hold the handover ceremony on July 30. This move and the recovery of the Public Concession can be realized within the same period, which makes the people of the whole country feel infinitely gratified and cheer for the future of China's liberation. At this time of the recovery of the concessions, we cherish the struggle of the revolutionary martyrs and look forward to the future of the free and liberated new China, and we have deep feelings. Now we will briefly express our thoughts and hopes, and we should encourage each other with the people of the country.</p>
<p>(1) After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States have been defeated, but the poison planted by Britain and the United States in their minds has not been completely eliminated. Because the Shanghai Concession is the most deeply rooted base of British and American toxins, this time the authorities will take over the Public Concession, which is a thorough elimination of the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States. From now on, the place where the poisons and dirt are hidden will be washed clean, and the original face of our Chinese territory will be restored. The wrong concept of blindly believing in Britain and the United States will also become a great psychology of relying on our own government.</p>
<p>(2) The wise measures of the French government were indeed inspired by the moral spirit of the friendly country Japan, but their expression of goodwill was based on mutual understanding between the two countries. During this war, China and France were both countries deceived by Britain and the United States, so China has a special and deep sympathy for the French experience. We are very grateful for France's sincere friendship with our country. After the return of the Shanghai French Concession, the moral relationship between China and France will inevitably enter a new stage and become more and more friendly, which is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>(3) The friendly country Japan's sincerity in assisting us this time can be foreseen in Ambassador Gu's recent speech on the "Realization of the True Policy toward China" at the welcome meeting of the Chinese National Diplomacy Promotion Association. We should strive forward. We must know that China will not obtain a truly independent and free status as long as there is a concession in China. Thinking that Shanghai after the recovery of the concession will surely become a center for Sino-Japanese cooperation to defeat British and American imperialism, the so-called international city will never have the shadow of Britain and the United States, but only the glory of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity and Co-enjoyment. The Chinese territory will forever become a free paradise. In order to repay the friendly country's sincerity in assisting our country's independence and liberation, the whole country should unite and cooperate closely with the friendly country to jointly complete the Greater East Asia War. Only the overall victory of the Greater East Asia War can liberate the entire East Asian nation and enable them to enjoy a peaceful and happy life forever.</p>
<p>Shanghai occupies an important position in both China and the international community. It is the economic center of China. Therefore, the development of domestic politics, culture, etc. is deeply affected by it. It is also an international city, which is a arena for international competition. Now that the concessions have been recovered, the old view has been changed, which has a great impact on international audio-visual. Its benefits to our country's sovereignty are also very great. A hundred years of long-cherished wish has been realized in one day. It all depends on the Supreme Leader Chairman Wang's lofty personality and arduous struggle, so that he can win the sympathy of friendly countries and achieve the great cause of revival. The author has four hopes for the future:</p>
<p>(1) Expand municipal institutions and unify administrative efficiency. —In the past, due to the existence of the abnormal concession system, the country's sovereignty was often exercised in the concession. Shanghai became a "country within a country." Not only were administrative, judicial, and military affairs not subject to orders from the central government, but also municipal affairs such as police and taxation were established separately. Now all the concessions in the country have been recovered, and the sovereignty is independent and the territory is complete. Shanghai is one of the major cities in East Asia and a bond of the Co-prosperity Sphere. In the future, the municipal facilities will inevitably be greatly rectified. Not only will the institutions be expanded and the powers increased, but also the personnel issues must be carefully selected. From now on, we should follow the central government's policies and actively build a new "Greater Shanghai" city. As Foreign Minister Chu said: "The Chinese government will do its best to develop it into a city that the world admires." This is not only my personal hope, but also the hope of the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>(2) Stabilize people's livelihood and suppress prices. —Shanghai is located on the front line of the rear of the Greater East Asia War. It should implement the wartime system, and stabilizing people's livelihood is also one of the important measures of the wartime system. Before the official recovery of the concessions, Shanghai's prices soared again. If this continues, it will have a great impact on the psychology of the people, and indirectly have a considerable hindrance to the country's administration. Although the authorities have tried their best to investigate the factors of hoarding and hoarding, and strictly punish unscrupulous merchants and suppress prices, the effect of treatment is not great. Now that the concessions have been recovered and a new municipality has been established, I hope that the authorities will deeply understand the people's livelihood and study the fundamental measures to stabilize the people's livelihood, such as improving the supply system, increasing production, thoroughly eliminating the practice of hoarding and speculation, and actively cracking down on rumors that disturb people's minds. Once the wind of speculation is curbed, prices will naturally be stabilized, and residents will be able to live and work in peace, and their trust in the government will be strengthened. This is an inevitable trend.</p>
<p>(3) Rectify customs and advocate thrift. —Shanghai residents have always been fascinated by "Westernization" and advocate luxury. In this time of war, thrift should be advocated. After the recovery of the concessions, the poisoned thoughts of Britain and the United States will be completely eliminated, and the New National Movement will become the creed of life worshiped by the people. Public officials must develop a spirit of integrity and dedication to public service, and work hard. All false and extravagant entertainment can be saved. The common people should also advocate thrift and simplicity, have a spirit of self-reproach, and work hard in their respective positions. Reduce all unnecessary social interactions at ordinary times. The new Greater Shanghai must become a model city for the universal implementation of the New National Movement.</p>
<p>(4) Establish public security and strive for construction. —The Baojia system organized by the former Public Concession and the French Concession was indeed a long-term strategy to maintain public security. Now that the concessions have been recovered. Municipal facilities have also been reformed, and the Baojia system is very admirable, but it still needs to be improved. I deeply hope that the police authorities responsible for ensuring public security in the future must know that Shanghai's position is very important to both China and the international community. The establishment of public security at ordinary times is one of the important issues after the takeover of the concessions. I deeply hope that the people and the authorities will cooperate to maintain it. With the establishment of public security and the stability of people's livelihood, we can then immerse ourselves in productive work. It is expected that the full recovery of the concessions this time will have a greater development. I deeply hope that the whole country will unite as one, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, we will work harder, cooperate with the allied countries to move forward, and complete the historical mission of restoring China and defending East Asia, so as not to disappoint the kindness of the allied countries to us. All my compatriots should encourage each other.</p>
<p>Article 4: Li Quanshi</p>
<p>On August 29, 1842, China and Britain signed the Treaty of Nanjing, ending the Opium War. The treaty stipulated that five ports would be opened for trade, and the Shanghai Concession began at that time. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War the year before last, the British and American forces have been driven out of the Far East. Today, we are grateful to friendly countries for completely returning the Shanghai Concession to Chinese administration in terms of jurisprudence, 100 full years minus 28 days from its legal beginning, which is really worthy of special writing and special celebration.</p>
<p>Some say that the return of the Shanghai International Settlement and other settlements in North China and South China by friendly countries is nothing more than being generous with other people's property; but then, a few months ago, the British and American governments also stated to Chongqing that they would abolish extraterritorial rights and cancel the concessions along the rivers and coasts in China. Isn't this also being generous with other people's property? In short, the world situation has evolved to the current stage, and whether friendly or hostile, they have to change their plans in order to win back public opinion, and help the unprecedented war end in their own country's favor. Therefore, no matter what changes there will be in the world situation in the future, the concessions in various parts of China—including the Shanghai Concession—will permanently remain in the arms of the motherland, and there will no longer be any danger of being seized by the clutches of imperialist countries again. This is what the reporter dares to assert.</p>
<p>At this time when the last bastion of the concession system—the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession—is being dismantled under the heavy pressure of the times, the reporter, as one of hundreds of millions of Chinese people, cannot help but want to float a big white with the people.</p>
<p>After the celebration, I hope for it. First, I hope that the Rong country's administrative authorities will manage the concessions with honesty and dedication to the public, so that they will not only live up to the expectations of friendly countries, but also provide a clear solution to the pessimists, cynics, and even schadenfreudeists among the Chinese people. The gifts sent by friendly countries will not only not be wasted and trampled on, but will also be icing on the cake and strive for excellence. Second, I hope that after the Shanghai Concession, that is, the last concession, is recovered, China's internal strife will not be as frequent as it has been in the past few decades, so that military and political figures who oppose the central government will no longer have a safe source of conspiracy. Third, I hope that after the Shanghai Concession is returned, the people of Shanghai will no longer be "new Jews," who only know how to protect their own lives and interests, speculate and take chances, regardless of the outcome of the country's economy and people's livelihood, and resolutely assume the responsibilities assigned to us by this great era. With a clean heart, we will change and become "new Chinese," and restore our national self-esteem that has been lost for more than a hundred years. Fourth, I hope that after the Shanghai Concession is recovered, the national floating capital will no longer be concentrated in Shanghai, and the national industry will not tend to gather in Shanghai. There must be a rational plan for the decentralization of industry throughout the country, but Shanghai's position as the second trading port in East Asia, with its superior geographical location, may always be maintained and not easily be taken by other ports. Fifth, after the Shanghai Concession is recovered, the taxation power of our country's central government can freely enter and exit the concessions where tax evaders gather. Then, direct capacity taxes such as land value tax, land appreciation tax, income tax, inheritance tax, and excessive profit tax during extraordinary periods (according to the special name of excessive profit during extraordinary periods, that is, war profiteering or national disaster wealth. After national disaster wealth is made, a large amount of tax must be paid, so it is better not to make national disaster wealth, because this tax has a great effect on suppressing the psychology of illegal merchants who want to make national disaster wealth at will.) and other taxes will be implemented in Shanghai. Not only will the national government's finances gain a new force, but after taxation, it will be able to recover part of the currency and stabilize prices to a considerable extent. Hope is the mother of facts. I hope that the above five hopes will be realized soon to comfort the millions of Shanghai citizens and the hundreds of millions of people across the country.</p>
<h3>Some Opinions on the Return of Concessions</h3>
<p>— Yoshida Tosuke</p>
<p>Speaking Honestly</p>
<p>Recently, many Japanese have asked me, how are the general Chinese people rejoicing over the return of concessions this time? Answering this inquiry is a difficult matter. Because to answer this inquiry correctly, one must write several large books. Of course, some Chinese, especially those who can think about the political significance of the return of concessions, can immediately answer this inquiry by saying that the return of concessions is the first step in the liberation of China and the foundation of peace in East Asia. But it is not permissible to think that all the Chinese in Shanghai are happy about the return of concessions just after hearing these people's words. Those who have no time or money to participate in politics—in fact, most of the population of Shanghai is composed of such people—before understanding the political significance of the return of concessions, they first consider the impact of the return of concessions on their own lives. Therefore, in the eyes of such people, what will be the general price of rice after the return of concessions? Or will the rationed rice be reduced compared to now? This question is more important than the political significance of the return of concessions to the future of Greater East Asia. Whether these people like the return of concessions depends on the quality of concession administration after the return of concessions. If the concession administration after the return of concessions is good, then everyone except the Chongqing faction of Chinese in the concessions will surely be overjoyed and happy about the return of concessions. However, if the concession administration tends to deteriorate after the return of concessions, then even if the ideals and purposes of the return of concessions are ever so lofty, most of the Chinese in the concessions will be indifferent. Therefore, I think it is still too early to raise the question of whether people like the return of concessions.</p>
<p>Let's not talk about practical problems for the time being, but only from a theoretical point of view. Of course, the return of concessions should be something to be happy about from the Chinese standpoint. However, in the current situation, this is ultimately a "should be" Sollen question, and not a "is" Sein question. Since this is the case, where exactly does the political significance of the return of concessions lie? I think that the return of concessions is an expression of Japan's intention to rapidly achieve the ideal of "should be" from the backward reality. Whether the National Government is better at handling concession administration than before at this stage is, to be honest, truly a question. Nevertheless, Japan is handing over the administration of Shanghai, the central city of the geographically Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, to the National Government. This is a policy implemented by Japan based on its political beliefs about China. Japan hopes to rapidly bring reality in line with ideals by satisfying Chinese ideals that are several steps ahead of the original Chinese reality.</p>
<p>Whether the National Government can rapidly bring reality in line with ideals should be the National Government's greatest task. Shanghai is different from Nanjing, and Shanghai is international. The residents of Shanghai include British and American imperialists, as well as people of fifty-three countries from all over the world mixed together. To put it bluntly, the residents of Shanghai are reckless. To put it more nicely, they are like a crowd of knights galloping in the midst of a thousand troops and ten thousand horses. If the National Government can make this group of Shanghai residents sincerely submit, it can prove its administrative ability in front of the world. Chen Youren once said: "What Shanghai thinks today, the whole of China will think tomorrow." If the Nanjing government can convince the Shanghai people today, then it will not be difficult to convince the people of the whole of China tomorrow, I think. Conversely, if the Nanjing government fails in its administration of Shanghai, its failure will be a failure in front of the world. At the same time, it will also be a major blow to the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, Japan cannot remain silent and say coolly, "It has nothing to do with me." From this point of view, the return of the Shanghai concessions, in a sense, can also be said to be a serious test imposed on the National Government. But this is not simply a test for the National Government, but also a serious test imposed on the citizens of Shanghai, because politics is a relative relationship between the government and the people. Good politics is impossible without the good assistance of the people. Furthermore, it is also a serious test imposed on Japan, because from the perspective of the reality of Shanghai, good politics in Shanghai is impossible without the good assistance of Japan. From this standpoint, I hope everyone will pay attention to the following three tendencies that should not exist.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about a tendency within the National Government. It is said that some people in the Nanjing government are so excited about the return of the Shanghai concessions that they are overjoyed, just like a student who has passed the entrance examination receiving a notification of passing the entrance examination. However, they usually dislike exams very much. Passing an exam is because they know that the entrance examination is a difficult hurdle that can only be passed through extraordinary hard work. Those who do not know that the entrance examination is a difficult hurdle and think that it can be passed without hard work will mostly fail. Today, people in the National Government must know that the concession administration after the return of concessions is a major hurdle that can only be passed through the National Government's extraordinary hard work. The return of concessions is the entrance examination for the National Government. But it is truly regrettable to only know how to be happy about the return of concessions and not know how to face this major event with a tragic determination. The exam has not yet been passed, and now they are already happy, which is inevitably too optimistic. I hope they should have this awareness.</p>
<p>Second, let's talk about a tendency in some Japanese, namely the extreme left interpretation of the so-called "new policy." Strictly speaking, the so-called "new policy" is by no means that everything can be left alone after handing everything over to China. The result of the return of concessions to China is that the administrative power of the concessions is transferred to the National Government. Therefore, the quality of the concession administration is China's own business. If there are people in Japan who think this way, they completely do not understand the meaning of the return of concessions. Regarding whether the future concession administration can be good, if there is no sufficient insight, but only relying on the ideal of returning it to the National Government, even if the National Government is happy, the Shanghai citizens will not be happy in the end. Of course, Japan foresaw the possibility of full development of Shanghai's administration under the jurisdiction of the National Government after the return of concessions, and that is why it wanted to do this. Therefore, in fact, when Shanghai's administration does not proceed smoothly, Japan also has a great responsibility. Shanghai is the frontline of the ideological war against Chongqing. If Shanghai's administration is not implemented well and the lives of Shanghai citizens become more difficult, it will become an excuse for Chongqing and the United States and Britain to attack. Therefore, even though Japan says it is returning the concessions to the National Government, it still needs to pay close attention to Shanghai's administration as a guardian, especially to the material distribution agencies (the most important of which is household rice) and inspection agencies that have a significant impact on the actual lives of citizens. Here I want to say frankly that there is a certain degree of fear among Shanghai citizens about the future police agencies. Shanghai citizens still remember very clearly that not long ago, the "second type of pro-Japanese" gang hid in the name of special police in Huxi and committed many heinous crimes. They arrested people for money, which was really a kind of political kidnapping. Although these political kidnapping bandits were severely punished by law, Shanghai citizens still believe that there are remnants of such scum and that they will come back to Shanghai and put on a good show of doing evil again, which is really "unbearable." Therefore, within the Shanghai police agencies, there should no longer be people who cause Shanghai citizens to have the terror of expecting political kidnapping.</p>
<p>Third, now I will describe a tendency among Shanghai citizens. In certain situations, people sometimes have to call a stag a horse. Biologists call it "individual preservation instinct," and the Chinese euphemistically call it "self-preservation tactics," but the general Shanghai citizens' situation of calling a stag a horse seems to be too much. Even regarding the feelings about the return of concessions, it is really not easy to judge which part heard from the mouths of Shanghai citizens is a sincere expression and which part is a perfunctory remark of "self-preservation tactics." In this respect, I think it is indeed difficult for those in power to handle. Therefore, if they do not reveal their true feelings and work together with those in power, there will be no good politics in Shanghai. The place most directly affected by the return of concessions is the lives of Shanghai citizens. If Shanghai citizens hold the same negative views on politics as always, the future of concession administration will never be simply bright. When the future concession administration becomes a dark scene, part of the responsibility will fall on the Shanghai citizens who are negligent in assisting. Therefore, Shanghai citizens should reduce the attitude of calling a stag a horse and restore a little the attitude of saying horse is horse and stag is stag. I hope that Shanghai citizens will often offer the government their true feelings and words. Without the assistance of Shanghai citizens, the Shanghai administration after the return of concessions will never grow smoothly. Will Shanghai develop into a world-famous metropolis in China? Or will it quickly wither and decline like a rubber boat with its mooring rope untied? This depends on the attitude of Shanghai citizens towards politics. It is a cowardly act for Shanghai citizens to not provide any assistance to the concession administration and only know how to criticize the administrators who have messed up the concession administration.</p>
<p>Shanghai citizens should take this opportunity to organize public opinion organs, that is, for the sake of the smooth development of Shanghai's administration, they should also actively provide public opinion to the authorities.</p>
<p>The above is my opinion on the return of concessions. Simply exploring the significance of the return of concessions in history can be said to be incompatible with the reality of the extremely fierce Greater East Asia War. Therefore, simply being intoxicated with happy words such as "The concessions have been returned, thank God" will not easily solve the various countless difficult problems after the return of concessions. At the same time, I think it is also unfair to the urgent emotions of the three million citizens who are worried about their future lives after the return of concessions. Before I talk about celebrating the return of concessions, let me remind everyone that this is the most difficult entrance exam imposed on the people of China and Japan. (Han)</p>
<h3>Receiving the Shanghai Concessions and Future Operation</h3>
<p>— Matsuda Tsuneo</p>
<p>(1) The National Government's reception of the administrative power of the Shanghai International Settlement is scheduled to be realized on August 1. For a hundred years, the Shanghai International Settlement, which was occupied by the British and Americans as a stronghold of the policy of colonizing China, is truly a joyous event for China, Japan, and the entire East Asia.</p>
<p>The National Government's restoration of sovereignty over Shanghai and its control over Shanghai's politics and economy will undoubtedly rapidly enrich and strengthen the National Government's political power in the future. Before the China Incident, the reason why the Chiang regime was able to rapidly become strong was that Chiang Kai-shek abandoned the so-called policy of alliance with the Soviet Union and tolerance of the Communists in the Republic of China in 1927 and implemented a 180-degree turnaround in Shanghai on April 12, compromising with the wealthy class in Shanghai. In fact, most of China's wealth, centered on the Zhejiang financial group, is concentrated in Shanghai, accounting for about 50% of China's foreign trade. The Shanghai concessions enjoyed a special political status, "in China but not owned by China."</p>
<p>For about five years from the China Incident to the Greater East Asia War, this particularity was used by the British and American policy of aiding Chiang. The Shanghai concessions became a stronghold for resisting Japan, and they often expressed blatant hostility towards Japan. However, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the situation changed completely. The rights and interests of the British and Americans were completely taken over and managed by the Japanese army. The strongholds for invading East Asia were all destroyed, and the Shanghai economy, which depended on British and American capital, was cut off from British and American influence. The Shanghai financial circles, which had always taken a cold and ambiguous attitude towards the peace movement of the National Government, could not but change their views on the new situation in Greater East Asia from the perspective of self-interest. On January 9 of this year, after the National Government's participation in the war and Japan's unfolding of the new policy towards China, the National Commercial Control Association was organized. Twenty Shanghai financial giants served as directors and supervisors of the association. This is proof of the Shanghai financial circles' change of attitude and their assistance in the National Government's policies. Since the Japanese army entered the concessions and made the security police of the concessions under the guidance of the Japanese side, there have been Baojia organizations among the Chinese residents of the concessions, and they have achieved good results. Previously, they were the "loose sand" mentioned by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and they lived in what could be called a state of anarchy. It cannot be said that living this kind of orderly and organized life now is an unexpected change.</p>
<p>(2) Here, we need to look back at the origin of the Shanghai concessions' prosperity before today, with the special character of "in China but owned by China."</p>
<p>Regarding the prosperity of Shanghai, the reports of Li Que Te and Fei Da Mu pointed out:</p>
<p>"The concentration of wealth and commercial activity in the concessions is due to the fact that the concessions are a safe island, free from external harassment. Within their scope, order is maintained, and individual rights and property rights are respected and protected."</p>
<p>Indeed, the Shanghai concessions were protected by the navies of the countries concerned and the volunteer corps of the Municipal Council. They often maintained neutrality in the face of China's internal strife and refused to allow Chinese troops to enter the concessions. The Shanghai concessions were politically isolated from China itself because of this military force, and they were not affected by the political chaos and instability of China, avoiding the monopolistic control of Chinese warlords and factions. This matter hindered the integrity of China's sovereignty, and at the same time, the key to Shanghai's prosperity also lies in this.</p>
<p>However, the prosperity of Shanghai achieved in this way was by no means for China itself.</p>
<p>Those who benefited from Shanghai's prosperity were British and American capital and Chinese comprador capital that was subservient to British and American capital. Although China is an agricultural country, it is constantly plagued by chronic food shortages and cannot import foreign rice every year to supplement it. The biggest reason for this is of course the abandonment of China's own agricultural productivity, but at the same time, foreign agricultural products are dumped on China through the Shanghai market, and foreign industrial products and Chinese agricultural products are forcibly exchanged at unequal prices. The ruthless exploitation and aggression of British and American capitalism undoubtedly also hinders the development of Chinese agriculture.</p>
<p>Although there are suitable cotton-growing areas in North China and Central China, the Chinese textile industry in Shanghai does not rely on Chinese-produced cotton, but often relies on the import of American cotton and Indian cotton.</p>
<p>Similarly, China's flour millers have no relationship with wheat cultivation in the interior, but are inextricably linked to Australian wheat. In this way, British and American capitalism, which stepped in with the Shanghai concessions as its base, cut off the connection between Shanghai and the Chinese countryside, and exploited the Chinese economy through the Shanghai economy, making it a sacrifice for its colonial policy. The prosperity of the Shanghai concessions can be said to be built on the poverty of the entire China, and the more cunning Chinese comprador capital is only a running dog of British and American capital to enrich itself.</p>
<p>Therefore, if Shanghai prospers with the special character of "in China but not owned by China," it contains two meanings. First, the Shanghai concessions therefore often expressed how to protect themselves from the political corruption and chaos of China itself. Second, as a result, Britain and the United States used the Shanghai concessions as a base for invading China, trampling on China's sovereignty, and exploiting China's economy.</p>
<p>(3) The question here is how the National Government will operate Shanghai's politics and economy after restoring the administrative power of the Shanghai concessions. Chairman Wang once said: Because of the National Government's participation in the war, the task that China should bear is to "build the rear base." This is of course the fundamental principle in Shanghai's economy in the future. Shanghai is located at the mouth of the Yangtze River, which winds for more than three thousand miles and has a long history. Behind it is the most fertile land and densely populated river basin in China. No matter how you say it, this geographical situation is always Shanghai's greatest advantage. This advantage must be fully utilized.</p>
<p>In the context of the Chinese economy, in order to increase production, stabilize people's livelihoods, improve people's livelihoods, and maintain currency in order to achieve the effect of price countermeasures, it is difficult to solve the problem unless the circulation of goods is facilitated first. After the China Incident, the stagnation of industrial production in China, centered on Shanghai, and the consequent shortage of essential supplies for rural life and high prices, made the inland rural economy, which had always relied on industrial production in Shanghai, self-sufficient. The Shanghai economy and the inland economy showed a tendency to separate rapidly, which deepened the insecurity of people's lives. This is an undeniable fact. This has also contributed to the speculative nature of Chinese national capital concentrated in the Shanghai concessions, increased the evils of barter fever and hoarding, and stimulated price increases.</p>
<p>In order to open up this situation, Japan's new economic policy towards China first opened up and eased the economic blockade of the lower Yangtze River region. On March 16, all restrictions on the movement of goods by the local army were abolished. Except for the movement of some goods in and out of the Shanghai area, the movement of goods in the entire peaceful area has been liberalized, restoring the connection between Shanghai and the rural areas behind it. At the same time, based on the concept of so-called "division of labor and cooperation," the purchase and distribution of Chinese goods in Central China was entrusted to the Chinese side in order to promote its commercial activities. On the one hand, the return of various enemy properties, old and new, was continued to mobilize Shanghai's idle funds for production in the agricultural and industrial sectors, opening the way for the transformation and revival of Chinese national capital into production capital.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned new situation, the current reception of the administrative power of the Shanghai International Settlement has been added. The connection and cooperation between the National Government and the Shanghai economic circles is becoming closer. With Shanghai's economic power as its support, the National Government will be able to powerfully exert its political power, significantly promote the revival of the Chinese economy, and further contribute to China's cooperation in completing the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>(4) The future operation of Shanghai's politics and economy should naturally be implemented based on the fundamental requirement of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Here, first, we hope to not only cultivate Shanghai as the center of the Chinese economy, but also as the most important economic link in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Shanghai should not exist only for China. Building Greater East Asia is a new "China problem" and "Shanghai problem."</p>
<p>Dr. Sugimura Takeshi advocated making Shanghai the economic capital of East Asia in his book "Economic Status of Shanghai, China." Indeed, the future of Shanghai should be operated from the viewpoint of the overall economic concept of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the basis for reorganizing Shanghai's economy must lie here.</p>
<p>In the past, the structure of Shanghai's trade completely reflected the British and American capital's policy of exploiting China. The increase in the import of foreign cotton to foreign rice, foreign wheat, foreign coal, and tobacco, and the fact that China's industrial production cannot be increased without this excess of imports, and the importance of relying on remittances from overseas Chinese, these facts illustrate how the British and American exploitation policy has hindered the normal development of the Chinese economy and made the Shanghai economy take a distorted path.</p>
<p>With the progress of the China Incident, this dependence of Shanghai's trade on the British and Americans not only did not decrease, but increased, which shows how Shanghai was used by the British and Americans as a base for the British and American anti-Japanese hostile policy.</p>
<p>Now that Shanghai's dependence on the British and Americans has been eradicated from the root, there is no other way to revive it than to integrate it into the economy of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Moreover, Shanghai's geographical location in Greater East Asia, with a vast area behind it as a production area for raw materials and a consumption area for goods, and its possession of various conditions that can serve as a cultivation base for light industry in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the fact that 20 million tons of ships enter and leave it every year, make Shanghai's future revival extremely promising.</p>
<p>Dr. Sugimura once pointed out: "Connecting Shanghai's industry with Southern resources is an important event that cannot be ignored in the economic plan of the entire East Asia."</p>
<p>He also said:</p>
<p>"If Shanghai is used as an economic base and the Southern economy is placed under the guidance of the Japanese side, then, whether in the intermittent development of the Chinese mainland or in enriching the economy of Manchuria, it is more advantageous than other places in terms of geographical advantages."</p>
<p>This also means that the future operation of Shanghai's politics and economy should not be left to the arbitrary control of the National Government. In other words, the National Government, based on the fundamental requirement of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, should expand the nature of Shanghai as a new international city under the guidance and cooperation of Japan. Chairman Wang keenly believes that the protection and revival of the entire East Asia is a prerequisite for the protection and revival of China. The independence of China's sovereignty, based on the fundamental requirements of a broad-area circle of politics, cannot but be subject to new regulations. This is a fundamental concept that the National Government cannot forget when operating Shanghai in the future.</p>
<p>(5) Second, we hope that the National Government will carefully implement various policies to transform Shanghai's national capital from idle funds into production capital. For example, Shanghai will regard itself as a huge source of wealth for the National Government in the future.</p>
<p>However, the National Government seems to never dare to be harsh and demand excessive taxes for financial reasons alone, so as to dry up Shanghai's economic power. Japan's opening of the economic blockade of the lower Yangtze River region and its attempt to smoothly exchange goods with Shanghai as the center are based on the so-called "</p>
<p>The following turns to the third edition</p>
<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>Transferred from the second edition of the concept of division of labor and cooperation" to promote the commercial production activities of Chinese national capital. If the National Government grasps Shanghai's political economy too hastily and makes the activities of Shanghai's capital shrink, it will cause a major obstacle to the revival of the Chinese economy itself and even to the construction of the economy of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>Here, we also recall Fei Da Mu's remarks on the issue of returning the Shanghai concessions, saying that "The return of the concessions should not be implemented until the following conditions are met." He cited four conditions:</p>
<p>1. The state of the country should be improved to the point that the concessions no longer have to worry about being affected by internal strife and other external dangers.</p>
<p>2. The concept of "politics is more important than law" is deeply rooted in China and is actually manifested in Chinese society. Therefore, constitutional politics should be developed to the point that the National Government formulates an organizational law for the future self-governing concession politics and grants it permanent and complete regulations and guarantees that the rights granted by its organizational law are inviolable.</p>
<p>3. The political state of China should be improved to the point that the local autonomous organs enjoy complete independence and freedom within their own concessions, obey the orders of the National Government, but are not controlled by powerful political parties such as the current Kuomintang.</p>
<p>4. The operation of the representative organs should have sufficient experience so that the Chinese society within the concessions can be responsible for the concession politics.</p>
<p>Of course, this is the conclusion of Mr. Fei Da Mu more than ten years ago, and we do not fully adopt it today. But we should consider it in the future operation of Shanghai, and we cannot deny the truth of his words.</p>
<p>At the same time, the British and American character of the Shanghai financial circles and "Shanghai people" must also be reformed at this time. However, at the same time, they have no experience in material control and no psychological preparation. The instinct of Shanghai and Shanghai people translates "control" into the complete opposite of anarchic freedom, and "politics" into the completely opposite "artificial" combined "pseudo-character." However, the most important thing in Shanghai's reorganization in the future is "control," and the fundamental difficulty lies in this.</p>
<p>The Huazhong material control centered on the National Commercial Control Association is implemented on the basis of the self-governing organization of the guilds, which implies the direction of solving this problem. In the same sense in the future, we must also review the utilization of Shanghai Gangbang industry from a new perspective! The purpose is as urgent as sparks, but the method cannot but be detoured.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>In short, the Shanghai re-organization problem can be said to be a central and extremely important task in building the economy of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The results of this are not only being paid attention to by various places in the Southern Circle, but also by the United States, Britain, and Chongqing.</p>
<p>The Chinese side should fully recognize what Japan expects and requires of Shanghai in the future. Wu Zhenxiu said frankly: "Since there is no precedent or experience in controlled economy in China, although the Chinese side is entrusted with the responsibility, it still hopes that Japan will assist in every way."</p>
<p>Japan's active guidance and cooperation should be fully accepted. (Translated by Song Hongxiang from "World Weekly Report" No. 1216 of the Dentsu News Agency)</p>
<h3>Tentative Suggestions for New Shanghai Municipal Facilities: A Letter of Recommendation from the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association to the Mayor</h3>
<p>In order to recover the concessions, which is of utmost importance to the nation's interests and the people's welfare, the association has held public discussions and reached a consensus. We respectfully present the following key recommendations, hoping for your review. The recovery of the British and French concessions in Shanghai is truly a joyous occasion for the government and the people, a moment of celebration and jubilation. After the recovery, how should we grasp the key points and innovate? The government must have a grand plan to meet the people's expectations. Considering that even the wisest can make mistakes, the association, as a group residing outside the government, has experienced the hardships of the people and humbly presents what we have seen and heard to the Mayor.</p>
<p>Dividing Lines Between Old and New Laws</p>
<p>First, clear dividing lines should be established between old and new laws. All previous agreements, such as the Yangjingbang Regulations of Daoguang 25 (1845), the Council Regulations of Tongzhi 7 (1868), the Court Agreements established in the 19th and 20th years of the Republic of China (1930-1931), and other contracts signed between the local government and the concession authorities, should be declared null and void. Simultaneously, new laws, such as zoning regulations and tax collection methods, should be implemented. These should be submitted to the central government or issued by the city government in the shortest possible time. This will give the people a fresh perspective, and prosperity will naturally follow. It is advisable to establish a Law Compilation and Review Committee, composed of senior officials from various bureaus of the municipal government, to complete this task.</p>
<p>Ensuring Security and Communication</p>
<p>Second, security should be ensured and communication maintained. Police are responsible for maintaining order in normal times, with the assistance of local volunteer corps. In serious situations, military assistance should be sought, as is common practice. The local volunteer corps, though lacking in power and bravery, are full of vigor and can deter minor disturbances. By guiding them appropriately, they can be of daily use. Military assistance is indispensable, and reliance should be placed on friendly foreign troops for temporary deployment. With such coordination, like the limbs and fingers working together, more than half of the major security concerns will be addressed.</p>
<p>Unifying Revenue and Expenditure</p>
<p>Third, revenue and expenditure should be unified. The annual tax revenue from the concessions exceeds 300 million yuan (approximately 200 million from the Public Concession and an estimated but unreported amount of at least 100 million from the French Concession). However, the expenditures of both concessions have not been announced, and final accounts are available only a year later. Now that the separation between the Chinese and concession areas has been eliminated, and Shanghai has become a single unit, a unified budget should be compiled. However, the income from the Western and Southern Districts may be far less than that of the two concessions. Overly subsidizing one area at the expense of another would be unfair. Consideration should be given to increasing taxes in the Western and Southern Districts, specifically earmarked for police salary increases and not used for other purposes.</p>
<p>Reducing the Price of Essential Goods</p>
<p>Fourth, the price of essential goods should be reduced. People suffer from high prices. Imported goods and luxuries can be dispensed with, but necessities such as firewood, rice, oil, and salt cannot be lacking for even a day. The true purpose of government control is to stabilize prices, yet the tighter the control, the higher the prices rise. This paradoxical situation is truly incomprehensible. Every effort should be made, such as facilitating supply sources, expediting transportation, streamlining import and export procedures, and lowering tax rates. With the government's efforts, the people will have a chance to survive. This is not only related to the political system but also to the lifeline of the nation.</p>
<p>Respecting Public Opinion</p>
<p>Fifth, public opinion should be respected. Although public opinion is scattered among the common people, there must be organized bodies to collect it. Article 112 of the draft constitution promulgated on May 18, 1937, states, "A municipal council shall be established in the city, with councilors elected by the citizens' assembly." This follows Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. Although it has not yet been implemented, it should be carried out as soon as possible when the concessions are recovered and the political system is renewed to build a foundation for construction. Furthermore, the restrictions on news censorship, publication control, and supervision of people's organizations, which are all reflections of public opinion, should be relaxed somewhat to gather the collective wisdom of the people. The above five points are fundamental and essential plans. Other aspects such as promoting industrial and commercial production, popularizing education and culture, and improving social customs rely on the Mayor's collective wisdom and long-term vision. We humbly offer these suggestions, hoping that they will be adopted and implemented, not only for the benefit of the region but also for the good of the nation. Respectfully submitted to Chen, the Mayor of the Shanghai Special Municipality.</p>
<h3>Old Shanghai Stories: Interviews with Four Elders</h3>
<p>On this day of taking over the concessions, everyone is happily celebrating. Perhaps everything feels exciting. Recalling the fragments and trivial matters heard and seen about the concessions decades ago and writing them down to add to today's celebratory mood is not without significance. Therefore, we specially interviewed four elders who have lived in Shanghai for many years: Mr. Shen Xinqing, Mr. Lin Kanghou, Mr. Yuan Ludeng, and Mr. Gao Hanqing (in order of stroke count of their surnames) to recall old Shanghai stories. The four elders were extremely happy and recounted the past in detail. The notes are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Xinqing</p>
<p>I came to Shanghai in the eleventh year of Tongzhi (1872, when I was nine years old). I soon returned to my ancestral home in Jiading, but after a few months, I moved back to Shanghai. At that time, the means of transportation were like those in rural towns, with only handcarts and sedan chairs. Foreigners in Shanghai also used these for transportation. Soon, horse-drawn carriages and rickshaws appeared one after another. At that time, Xian'gua Street was the main thoroughfare for north-south traffic. People traveling west to the county town and the Little East Gate all passed through here. Crossing West Street, one could reach the Huangpu River to the east. Further south, one relied on the Yidu Ferry. To the north was the Shiliupu Wharf, especially the area near the Three-Story Building Wharf, which was the most bustling. Thousands of sand boats were often docked there, with masts crowding together. Warehouses were lined up, and opium dens, brothels, teahouses, and taverns were all present. Those arriving by waterway disembarked from the Huangpu River and had to pass through this street, making it an extremely prosperous area. Later, due to the government's lack of protection, ruffians caused all kinds of disturbances, and people moved elsewhere, causing the cloth surface to become desolate. Recalling the past, I suddenly feel a sense of vast changes.</p>
<p>The current Edward Road was formerly known as Yangjingbang, which ran from outside the Old North Gate to Rihui Port. There was a Sanmaoguan Bridge on the bank of the river, located at the intersection of Henan Road. The bridge was built over the river to facilitate transportation in the concession area. I heard my father say that during the Taiping Rebellion, the French helped Li Hongzhang reduce taxes in Sichuan, and the Sanmaoge Pavilion was destroyed in this battle. The French took this opportunity to expand the concession, which gave me a very negative impression of the French. Later, the river was filled in and roads were built, and this historically significant Sanmaoge Pavilion was buried and disappeared. In the first three years of the Republic of China (1912-1914), Yuan Shikai secretly plotted to become emperor. At that time, the strongest opposition came from the Kuomintang. They tried to eliminate party members. A member of the Hubei branch of the Kuomintang, Liu Tie, secretly manufactured bombs in the French Concession. He was mistakenly smoking a cigarette among the explosives, causing a fire. Liu Tie was also arrested as a result. Yuan Shikai sought to extradite and arrest political prisoners in the French Concession and ceded dozens of square miles of land from the Ten Pulps to Xujiahui as a condition for the extradition. His昏庸賣國, treasonous actions are evident from this. The current French Concession is actually a history of heartbreak for Mr. Liu Tie. Now, fortunately, the French Concession has been recovered by the national government, which is a great joy.</p>
<p>In the past, the uniforms of the French Concession police were laughable. In the summer, they wore melon-skin hats with red tassels tied to the back. They wore long gowns made of green bamboo cloth. In the winter, the melon-skin hats were replaced with Jiaozhou gold-rimmed felt hats, and the red tassels remained tied to the back. Their clothes, shoes, and socks were the same as in the summer, except that they wore a cloth棉袍 of the same color under the long gowns and a foreign overcoat over that. They carried an umbrella in their hands. Later, they changed to a sky-blue, collarless number uniform with sleeves more than two feet wide, similar to the old-fashioned mandarin jacket and the green jackets of the Green Gang. Ordinary shoes and socks were worn with no uniform pants, which the wearers could choose as they pleased. This kind of uniform was the same for all seasons and had no differences. Later, it was gradually reformed into the current uniform style, which can be said to be a multifaceted evolution.</p>
<p>The oldest Chinese newspaper in Shanghai was Shen Bao. Wang Tao's son-in-law, Qian Xinbo, was in charge of the editorial department of Shen Bao at that time. Wang Tao was influenced by the Taiping Rebellion and advocated revolution very strongly. His writing style was also strong. He often submitted articles to the newspaper. The most inspiring and widely recited sentences at that time were like: "The Three Emperors are not enough to be emperors, the Five Emperors are not enough to be emperors, only my Heavenly King, commands hundreds of thousands of elite soldiers, and slays the demons of eighteen provinces," etc. This shows Wang Tao's thoughts and boldness. He was eventually resented by the Qing court and fled to Hong Kong to run the newspaper. Later, he returned to Shanghai, and I still met him a few times. (Recorded by Chen Yunxi)</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Kanghou</p>
<p>A system similar to the current Baojia system (a system of collective responsibility and mutual surveillance) was also implemented in the past and was quite complete. Barriers were set up on every street and alley entrance. At night, all the barriers were closed. People entering and exiting had to be questioned first. As long as they were legitimate merchants, they could still pass through. Unlike now, when a lockdown is imposed, all traffic stops, and no one is allowed to pass. Moreover, the attitude during questioning was extremely kind and friendly. The current Baojia system is even more complete than before. However, during general martial law, it seems that some flexibility could be given to people with identification cards and those who have work missions, so that they do not have to waste time and affect their duties.</p>
<p>Shanghai was divided into four districts, with a total of seven city gates. Later, two more gates, the Little South Gate and the Little North Gate, were added. There was a mud city built between the current New World and the Great New Company, hence the name Mud City Bridge today. At that time, the area west of the New World was all rural farmland. Although there were also foreigners who bought land and built houses there, there were very few, so it was extremely desolate.</p>
<p>Regarding the organs for communicating public opinion, there were two in the past. One was the Municipal Council, and the other was the County Council. In the late Qing Dynasty, the Qing court vigorously promoted democracy and constitutionalism in order to win over the people's hearts. By the early years of the Republic of China, it had declined. I hope that after the recovery of the concessions, a truly representative body of public opinion can be established to bridge the gap between the authorities and the people. (Recorded by Chen Yunxi)</p>
<p>Mr. Gao Hanqing</p>
<p>I grew up in Hongkou. At that time, Hongkou was just a village in the suburbs of Shanghai. There were no wooden bridges across the Suzhou River. People traveled back and forth by ferry at various ferry crossings, such as the First Ferry, Second Ferry, and Third Ferry. At that time, the Suzhou River was wider than the current Huangpu River, and the Huangpu River was even wider than it is now. One could not see the opposite bank from Puxi to Pudong. In the past, both banks of the Suzhou River and the Huangpu River were sandy beaches, with reeds growing in between, which was very desolate.</p>
<p>Regarding transportation: Rickshaws only appeared about thirty years ago. Before that, there were only sedan chairs and horse-drawn carriages, and even those were very few. Only high-ranking officials such as daotais and county officials, as well as compradors of foreign firms, could afford to ride them. At that time, the Shanghai daotai had great power and was also in charge of foreign affairs and customs, and was also called "Customs Daotai." At that time, the most common vehicle was the "goat horn cart," which is now called a "wheelbarrow" and was used to carry people and goods. Because it was cheap, many people used it.</p>
<p>Regarding education: Before there were schools, there were only private schools. At that time, there was a Longmen Academy, which was run by the government and was very large in scale. Scholars gathered there to lecture and exchange ideas. This was the situation thirty-five years ago.</p>
<p>When I was seven or eight years old, there was a school in Chen Family Lane, about a mile past the Tilam Bridge in Hongkou's eastern countryside, more than four miles from my home. Every morning, I would bring food to school and return home in the evening. The education situation at that time was roughly like this.</p>
<p>Regarding roads: There was a road from the Waibaidu Bridge to the Shiliupu Wharf. At that time, there were also Great Road, Second Road, etc., but they were very short, only as long as the Bund to the Bowling Green. At that time, the roads were just leveled and widened mud roads with some gravel and coal cinders added.</p>
<p>Thirty or forty years ago, there was already a racetrack. At that time, there were also small residential houses and cemeteries inside. Every year during the Qingming Festival, people would bring offerings to the racetrack to sweep the tombs. Even now, there are still a few cemeteries that have not been moved, but you can no longer see people visiting the graves.</p>
<p>At that time, the Shanghai market was not very lively, about the same as the towns in the near suburbs of Shanghai today. Foreign shops were mostly on the Bund and near the Great Road, which were relatively lively. The market inside the city, such as the Nine Acres Field, Sanpailou, and Sipailou, was much better than in the concessions.</p>
<p>Regarding public utilities: I will briefly mention a few points. Shanghai had trams about twenty years ago. Public buses were five or six years later than trams. Telephones had already existed more than thirty years ago. Tap water had already existed fifty years ago, and the scale was very large. There have been no major changes to this day. At that time, gas was already available, but it was only used by large foreign businesses. After electric lights were available, gas was eliminated.</p>
<p>The beginning of Chinese trains was probably in Shanghai. Fifty years ago, the Shanghai to Wusong line was already open to traffic. The office in charge of train affairs was located in the Temple of the Queen of Heaven. However, at that time, the atmosphere was closed, and the public was very conservative. Coincidentally, an epidemic and famine occurred in Shanghai. Local gentry believed that the "iron dragon" destroyed the feng shui and brought disasters. They publicly requested the local officials at that time to prohibit the operation of trains, which finally caused the trains to stop operating for a period of time.</p>
<p>Regarding finance: At that time, the only places for silver transactions were money shops. Transactions in the market mostly used copper coins, Mexican silver dollars, and broken silver. Large transactions used silver ingots and money tickets—that is, today's bank notes. Copper coins were mostly one thousand coins per string, with nine hundred coins exchanging for one Mexican silver dollar. (Recorded by Yue Xiuliang)</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan Ludeng</p>
<p>In the twenty-fourth year of the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty (1898 AD), when I was nineteen years old, I came to Shanghai from Ningbo and entered St. John's College to study. That was more than forty years ago. Now I will briefly talk about the general situation at that time based on my memories:</p>
<p>At that time, Nanjing Road in Shanghai mostly consisted of ordinary Chinese-style houses, all the way from the New World to the Mud City Bridge. The roads near Nanjing Road, such as Jiujiang Road, Hankou Road, Sichuan Road, and Ningbo Road, had already been built, and there were already new-style buildings. Several roads to the west, such as Xinzha Road, Avenue Road, Connaught Road, and Hart Road, had roads but no houses. Only a few scattered洋房 houses in the格路 and安路 areas, and there were no Chinese residences yet. From the司非而路 to Caojiadu, there were only rural residences. Zhoujiazhai Road did not exist at that time.</p>
<p>The only public entertainment venues were Zhang Garden and Yuyuan Garden, but both of these had already been abandoned.</p>
<p>At that time, the market in the French Concession was only relatively lively in the area around the Big Self-Ringing Bell. There was nothing in its entirety. The Bund, Great World, and the market on Avenue Joffre and Rue Tenant de la Tour had not yet appeared.</p>
<p>At that time, the administrative power of the two concessions was entirely in the hands of the British and French. The judicial organ of the concessions was the Mixed Court (commonly known as New Ho-Mun), and its original site is now the New World Company.</p>
<p>At that time, the cost of living was very low. The price of rice was only three dollars per dan. The highest tuition fee at St. John's University, including board, was only eight dollars a month. If you were a教会子弟 (child of a Christian family), it was completely free. Therefore, I continued my studies at the school until graduation for a period of seven years. Not only did I not pay any money, but I also earned five or six hundred dollars in subsidies during this period by working as an assistant teacher.</p>
<p>Regarding the general major events in the Public Concession, there are many that I do not know in great detail, because there was a period of time when I was serving in Ningbo. I will talk about what I know:</p>
<p>First, the Boxer Rebellion in the north in the Gengzi year (1900), because of advocating the complete killing of Christians, Shanghai was filled with rumors and the situation was extremely tense. Later, because the Governor-General of Liangguang, Liu Kunyi, and the Governor-General of Huguang, Zhang Zhidong, absolutely did not respond to the measures in the north and strongly protected the southeast half of the country, Shanghai was not affected in any way.</p>
<p>Second, the Wuxu Coup (Hundred Days' Reform), only Jing Liansun, the director of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, initially supported the Kang-Liang policy. After Kang and Liang failed, the government ordered Jing to be arrested, but Jing had already escaped, so there was no impact.</p>
<p>Third, the revolutionary period; because patriots Zou Rong, Zhang Binglin, etc. incited revolutionary ideas in Shanghai, they were hated by the Manchu Qing government, and Zou and Zhang were detained in prison. Later, Zou Rong died of illness in prison, and Zhang Binglin was released after being detained for several years.</p>
<p>Fourth, the boycott of American goods. A case occurred in the Mixed Court at that time. A Cantonese woman, Huang Li, was judged unfairly by the American vice-consul, and he wanted to punish her. At the same time, a Chinese official子 being子 was publicly insulted by the American consul. This aroused public anger and launched a boycott of American goods. The first to propose this was Mr. Zeng Shaoqing, who was later mediated by the British consul. After several months of negotiation, the matter was resolved.</p>
<p>After that, during the time of the Republic of China Revolution, when Mr. Chen Qimei served as都督 (military governor), there is no need to talk about it anymore. After that, there was the "May Thirtieth" Massacre. After the "May Thirtieth" Massacre, the Chinese began to organize the Chinese Ratepayers Association and elected. The concession authorities gradually paid attention to the Chinese, and after the struggle of the Chinese, the Chinese had the right to speak on changing the treatment of the Chinese. Before that, the Chinese did not even have the right to speak.</p>
<p>In the French Concession, in the past history, there was a conflict with the Ningbo Siming Public Cemetery, because a Yizhong (public burial ground) of the Siming Public Cemetery had its outer wall collapsed. The French Concession insisted on demolishing the wall and letting the land go, and the Public Cemetery opposed it. The French authorities then used high-pressure tactics, arousing public outrage, and the Yong people (people of Ningbo) completely went on strike. This conflict was resolved after several months. (Recorded by Yu Xiunuo)</p>

<h3>Also Considered Old Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yi</p>
<p>The time I lived in Shanghai was sporadic, pieced together, but only a dozen years. In my small life, it only occupies one-seventh, but from the beginning I saw Shanghai until now, it has occupied a time span of sixty-four years. I remember the first time I passed through Shanghai, I was only nine years old, it was in the Gengchen year of Guangxu (1900), because in this year, my father, Shao Sheng, passed the imperial examination and was appointed as a magistrate, and assigned to Zhili Province to fill vacancies. So he returned to his hometown in Suzhou to pick up his family and went north, hiring a pair of civilian boats and traveling for three days and two nights to reach Shanghai. The boat docked on the south bank of the Suzhou River, approximately near the current Pintang Bridge. This Suzhou River was deep-rooted and lush, the river surface was extremely wide, almost unable to see the north bank. From the boat to the shore was about twenty or more zhang. Ashore was still a vast ocean, with rice fields crisscrossing, walking through the small paths, suddenly seeing a bustling street, like the Suzhou Shantang or Mudu. This is the famous Great Road. My father and mother originally wanted to wander through the roads, but my sister and I pestered them, insisting on eating Cantonese mooncakes. These Cantonese mooncakes were something my father always brought home for us every time he returned home from Shanghai, so they made a deep impression on us. As soon as we arrived in Shanghai, we remembered these four words firmly. My father had no choice but to take us to the樓盤, a Cantonese teahouse, where we drank oolong tea and ate Cantonese mooncakes. Not long after, we still returned to the boat. Around midnight, my mother woke my siblings and me up in our sleep, the boat had already left its original location. We were a total of five people, moving to a very large house. Confused, we walked through winding, short, and narrow places, and came to a very small room. We unknowingly fell asleep, and when it dawned, my sister and I were motivated by curiosity to climb up layer by layer, suddenly brightened, then turned around this big house, built on the water surface, and very quickly moving forward there. Just as we were puzzled, my father also came, and began to tell me in detail that this is called a steamboat, the "Bao Da" ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, heading straight to Tianjin, and the ship fare for each person is ten taels and five qian of silver.</p>
<p>Nine years passed, and I was seventeen years old. My father resigned and returned home, and again arrived in Shanghai, everything was very different from nine years ago. Getting off the large steamboat, we entered a hotel on the north bank of the二涇, called "Mai An Inn". Because my father was seriously ill, we did not耽搁, and soon returned to Suzhou by boat. Five years passed, I was twenty-two years old, and in the Gui Si year Jiangnan Provincial Examination, I unexpectedly passed the examination to become a juren (a successful candidate in the provincial civil service examination). At that time, it was fashionable for jurens to print the articles of the three sessions, with the curriculum vitae attached at the beginning, into a thin book called "Shu Juan". This Shu Juan was given to people at will, and people would always send a gift in return, colloquially called "Da Chou Feng". So I brought several hundred copies of Shu Juan to Shanghai, living at a relative's house. This relative lived on the Great Road, I remember there was a large wall sign at the entrance, "Wan Kang Garden", approximately where the Wing On Company is now located, a very new three-story building, and the rent was only twenty-four yuan. He introduced me to a young, wealthy man, nicknamed Huang Baobao, the land and wharves on the Bund of the French Concession were all his father's inheritance. He received my Shu Juan and gave me twenty yuan, I was unintentionally happy. A friend also introduced me to a Commander Wu, this commander was a deputy general, leading two battalions of soldiers, stationed at the mouth of Wusong. Originally, there was a railway from Shanghai to Wusong, but last year a censor reported it, saying that railways were strange and ingenious, and that the land of Chinese etiquette could not allow them to惑民心 confuse the people. This大文 was published in "編世文"; I have forgotten the censor's surname and name. The Emperor was furious and strictly ordered the Governor-General of Liangjiang to demolish it immediately. Therefore, our country's Wusong could not take the train, and changed to horse carriages. Commander Wu treated me very well and asked the two generals to raise a hundred yuan to give me. As a result of Da Chou Feng, I received nearly three hundred yuan and returned fully loaded. But I regretted it very much, at that time the land in Mud City Bridge was a hundred yuan per mu. If I had bought more land with the money I got from Da Chou Feng, I would be 面子 very wealthy now.</p>
<p>In these years, some readers with new ideas gradually studied mathematics, physics (i.e. modern science), translation and other aspects privately. I am ashamed to say that I am also considered one of them. But without a teacher to teach, I often get nowhere. Our treasure trove is only a few translated books from the manufacturing bureau and the Guangxuehui, which are difficult to understand. Now it's good, Sheng Xuanhuai established a Nanyang Public School, and first recruited teachers for the normal school class, and I unexpectedly passed the entrance examination. Nanyang Public School was in the countryside of Xujiahui, the school site was a silk factory that had been shut down. The later school site is the current Jiaotong University, which was newly built three years later. At that time, the school was surrounded by fields, and there were not many foreign houses. On Sundays, running to the Concession, I couldn't sit in a rickshaw. So everyone mostly walked. In the Concession, I only visited two new bookstores, Zuoxin Society and Civilization Bookstore, to visit friends and look at new books. If I encountered heavy rain, I took off my clothes, or walked west along the current Jing'an Temple Road, or looked south from Ximen, all were muddy and载浮. I lived in Nanyang Public School for less than a year, I read English to the third book of grammar, the reader to the fourth volume, and learned algebra in mathematics, but they were only broken subjects, and then I left Shanghai again. Although this time was longer than the previous two, I did not go outside much, so my knowledge did not increase.</p>
<p>From then on, I wandered and wandered again, and suddenly wandered to thousands of miles of Yunnan, and encountered the Xinhai Revolution. Yunnan declared independence on September 9th, and was in chaos for two months. Although I ran back to Shanghai in a staggering state, the mission I was carrying was very important, it was to be sent by Governor Cai E to participate in the representatives' conference of various provinces to elect the first president of the Republic. I remember it was in the early part of the eleventh lunar month, passing through Hong Kong, the weather was extremely hot, and I was sweating all over. Only two days later, once passing through the mouth of Wusong, the gale was bone-piercing, and extreme cold invaded. At this time, the Concession was very different from before, because there was war and chaos everywhere in the inland, wealthy compatriots mostly ran to Shanghai, and the market was very prosperous. But like now, there were many entertainment venues such as gambling places, dance halls, and cinemas everywhere, nothing of the sort, so besides brothels, there was only one Zhang Garden, abbreviated as Zhang Garden. It stood on the west side of Mud City Bridge, although there were still rice fields on both sides, a flat road had been built in the middle, and both sides of the road were full of tall locust trees. In the shadow of the setting sun, the traffic was heavy, and it was even more noisy at night. At that time, I was the chief editor of the Shishi Xinbao, the work was complicated, how could I have the time to play. Shishi Xinbao, and Xinwenbao, Shenbao, Shenhua Daily, Shibao, Minli, were the six major newspapers at that time, mostly distributed on a street called Wangping Street. The owner of Shenbao, Xi Zipei, sold Shenbao, and I found a buyer for him, and it was sold for 100,000 yuan. The current site was moved by the new buyer.</p>
<p>Later, in the tenth year of the Republic of China, I went to Shanghai from Beijing to carry out my duties in Jinshi. In the twenty-sixth year, I went to Shanghai from Suzhou to treat my illness. Those are all recent events, although there have been many changes, and many people have been seen and heard, there is no need for an old monk to repeat them.</p>
<h3>Old Stories of the Marketplace in the Last Decade</h3>
<p>— Abandoned Runqing</p>
<p>To the editor of Shen Bao, I have recently been asked to contribute on the topic of Shanghai anecdotes from the last decade. Having come to Shanghai to engage in business at the age of fourteen, I have been living and working here for fifty-three years, a length of time that can undoubtedly be considered long. However, I am constantly amidst the marketplace, and my eyes and ears are primarily focused on my own profession. Therefore, what I can recall and what I can write about is limited to old stories of the marketplace.</p>
<p>Discussions about Shanghai's commerce often center on the concessions, but in fact, the most prosperous commercial area was originally in the Nanshi (South City), with the so-called concessions merely being "living outside the city walls." Later, as times changed and warfare became frequent, the concessions, due to their special administrative status, became a haven for avoiding worldly troubles. As a result, various businesses, to avoid the impact of the unstable situation, moved into the concessions one after another. Taking my own industry as an example, the earliest gathering place for discussions among colleagues was in the Inner Market next to the Yu Garden in today's Nanshi. Later, colleagues moved north, gradually dividing into North and South markets, resulting in the existence of both markets. After the Incident of 1937, the Nanshi market was virtually eliminated. Today, all colleagues have gathered entirely within the concessions. The so-called concessions are no longer what they looked like when they were first established. However, the creation of the concessions as a commercial center, while due to the efforts of the Chinese people, was also undeniably due to the nation's troubles, which is regrettable!</p>
<p>The last decade has been a period of significant changes in Shanghai's commercial and financial landscape. Important events, such as the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan, as well as financial panics and currency reforms, all occurred during this time. Due to Shanghai's important position, it often served as the primary area for implementing various reforms. Therefore, various financial changes were often seen first in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In the past, important ports all used the silver yuan standard. The debate over abolishing taels and adopting the yuan had been going on for a long time in both official and unofficial circles. It was not until the autumn of 1932, after the floods and the resulting economic hardship, that it began to materialize. The actual date for the unification of taels and yuan was April 6, 1933. Earlier, in early March, the Ministry of Finance officially issued an order stipulating that from March 10th, the conversion rate would be fixed at one silver yuan for every 0.715 Shanghai taels, and the fixed purity of the new silver yuan was also specified. After the announcement of this measure, silver and money exchange businesses immediately complied. From March 10th, all business transactions were conducted using silver yuan, and various market prices were gradually converted to silver yuan units. Soon after, the Ministry of Finance announced that from April 6th, all public and private funds, contracts, notes, and all transactions must be converted to silver yuan and no longer use silver taels. For those originally denominated in silver taels before that date, in Shanghai, the conversion should be based on 0.715 silver taels to one silver yuan. In other locations, the conversion should be based on the Shanghai exchange rate on April 5th, and then calculated according to the above fixed rate. At that time, the silver and money exchange businesses in Shanghai also discussed and agreed on measures to convert all silver tael deposits and debts to silver yuan according to the 0.715 rate (banks used April 3rd, and money shops used April 5th). It was also stipulated that all notes should be denominated in silver yuan. This fixed rate is still in use today.</p>
<p>The so-called financial panic occurred between 1934 and 1935, and spread across the country. At the end of 1934, the banks that suspended operations in Shanghai included China Savings, Wuhua, China Industrial, and Huadong. The money shops included Rongkang, Yikang, Dechang, and Baodayu. In Wuhu, there was Anhui Bank. In Guangzhou, there were Jia Hua and Nanhua. In 1935, the banks that suspended operations in Shanghai included Jiangnan, Ningbo Industrial, and Shijie. The money shops included Tongtai, Yongxing, and Dingshen. In July of that year, Ningbo also experienced a financial panic, with more than a dozen money shops suspending operations.</p>
<p>The causes of this financial panic were varied, but general opinion attributed it to the United States' silver policy. The result of the United States buying silver was a large outflow of silver from China. At the time, the country was still using silver currency, and the outflow of silver resulted in a significant shortage of money supply. Subsequently, due to the high price of silver, foreign goods flooded the market, while domestic goods became extremely cheap. Consequently, all industries declined, and problems arose one after another. The implementation of currency reform on November 3, 1935, concentrating silver, may have been motivated by this.</p>
<p>Today, Shanghai is suffering from rampant speculation. This reminds me of the yarn market turmoil six years ago (1937). Earlier, the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange's 20-count Golden Rooster brand cotton yarn saw its market price rise from over 270 yuan to 80 yuan on the day before the May delivery date, and announced the suspension of trading. According to reports at the time, there were only over 28,000 bales of yarn in Shanghai, but the number of long positions in speculation reached over 40,000 bales. As a result, spot market supply could not be balanced. After June of that year, speculators continued to buy in large quantities, and the market price continued to rise. Trading was suspended on the 9th, and again after the 12th. Trading finally resumed on the 16th. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce even sent personnel to investigate the case, but upon closer examination, it was merely the result of speculators squeezing each other, both long and short. At that time, the base prices of commodities were small, so fluctuations of tens of yuan were already a noteworthy event.</p>
<p>After 1937, Shanghai entered a state of war, and there were many more changes in the marketplace. However, it is not far from the present, so I will not repeat them.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the center of commerce and finance in the country, and the concessions are a concentrated commercial area. Although this was caused by the unstable domestic situation in the last century, it also demonstrates the achievements of the Chinese people's hard work. I anticipate that under favorable conditions, allowing everything to develop freely, the commercial achievements of the Chinese people will not be limited to the past concessions. Therefore, the primary condition for all economic development in our country in the future is stability.</p>
<h3>Newspaper Offices on Wangping Street Over the Past Thirty Years</h3>
<p>— Jiuyi</p>
<p>The area around Wangping Street had the most newspaper offices around 1912 and 1913. These short thirty-plus years can be divided into three periods: from 1912 going back to the Guangxu and Xuantong years as one period, from 1912 down to before the Incident of 1937 as another period, and then down to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War as yet another period. There are currently three existing newspaper offices, while the rest have either been reorganized, suspended publication, resumed publication, newly established, or moved far away. Now, I will describe what I can remember, and errors and omissions may be unavoidable.</p>
<p>Guangxu and Xuantong Years</p>
<p>Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, Shibao, Shenzhou Daily, Yulun Bao, Shishi Bao. The latter two newspapers merged into Yulun Shishi Bao and were then reorganized into Shishi Xinbao. Zhongwai Daily, Tianduo Bao, Minli Bao, which was reorganized into Minhu Bao and then reorganized into Minxu Bao.</p>
<p>From 1912 to Before the Incident of 1937</p>
<p>Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, Shibao, Shenzhou Daily, Shishi Xinbao, Tianchan Bao, Minguo Daily, reorganized into Minbao, Nanfang Bao, Dagonghe Daily, Asia Daily, Xin Shenbao (not the current Xin Shenbao), Shangbao, Chenbao, Dagong Bao, Zhonghua Daily.</p>
<p>After the Incident of 1937 to Before the Greater East Asia War</p>
<p>Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, Shibao, Dagong Bao, Chenbao, Zhonghua Daily, Shenzhou Daily (not the Shenzhou Daily mentioned earlier), Zhongmei Daily, Wenhui Bao, Xin Shenbao (not the Xin Shenbao mentioned earlier, and the address is not on Wangping Street, but it is included due to industry connections).</p>
<p>After the Greater East Asia War</p>
<p>Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, Zhonghua Daily, Xin Shenbao, Guomin Xinwen, Xin Zhongguo Daily, Ping Bao.</p>
<p>Printing Aspects</p>
<p>During the Guangxu and Xuantong years, newspapers used flatbed printing presses, powered by gas. After the layout was completed and the proofs were checked, no paper molds were made. The original plate was directly installed on the press and printed. Every midnight, when the printing press started, the "zhálàde...zhálàde" sound of the press disturbed the neighbors' good sleep. Later, it was felt that printing was time-consuming, the newspaper was published late, and it hindered the editing time, so rotary presses, web paper, and electric power were gradually adopted. An original plate could be arbitrarily made into multiple strips of paper molds, and then the paper molds were cast into lead plates, pressed into a semi-circular shape, installed on the press, and mass printing could be done, with the newspaper coming out in a continuous stream.</p>
<p>Rotary presses require web paper, and web paper must be white, strong, and not easily broken. Shanghai had many foreign paper merchants, and most newspapers used Canadian products. Also, for the purpose of storing paper, the dimensions of the machines were measured, sent to the paper mill to be custom-made, and shipped to Shanghai for future use. German-made paper mold paper was considered the best. Since the outbreak of the Great War, both types of paper have been drawn from inventory. If the war continues, there will eventually be a day when they run out.</p>
<p>Editorial Aspects</p>
<p>Initially, due to the limitations of machine power, the editing deadline was set at 10:00 PM every night, the proofs were checked by 11:00 PM, and printing started at 12:00 AM. Later, with the adoption of rotary presses, the deadline was gradually extended to 12:00 AM, 1:00 AM...5:00 AM. Occasionally, when major events occurred, after reporters investigated and reported, the draft was immediately prepared and set in type, secondary news was removed, placed in a prominent position, a new paper mold was made, installed on the press, and reprinted.</p>
<p>The editorial policies of each newspaper also differed. Some focused on editorials, some on telegrams, some on business news, and some on social news. They spared no expense in hiring famous reporters from various places, established a telegram news network, using telegrams for important matters. For matters where telegrams could not provide details, or for secondary events, the communication method was used to record details, catering to the readers' wishes. They also included casual essays, appropriate for both ancient and modern times, both serious and humorous, as chat fodder after tea and wine. Each newspaper also published pictorials once a day, once a week, or irregularly. Initially, they used stone lithography drawn by artists, and later they collected photos from various places in China and abroad, using photogravure printing on coated paper, making the scenes lifelike, which was even more welcomed by readers.</p>
<p>The scope of telegrams was extensive: wired telegrams, long-distance calls, and wireless telegrams. Wired telegrams were used the earliest, but the telegram fees were more expensive, so they were used sparingly to save costs. Later, long-distance telephone lines were connected to major areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and each newspaper rented telephone lines, reporting at a scheduled time every night. When wireless telegraphs became available, domestic and international telegrams could be received, with even greater effectiveness. Each newspaper spared no expense in purchasing receiving machines and hiring technicians to receive telegrams for their own use. International telegrams initially only translated a few important Reuters telegrams from foreign newspapers, just to fill a space. After the First World War, readers' attention gradually turned to foreign countries. Reuters, Havas, Associated Press, United Press, Domei News Agency, Reuter East Asia Service, TASS, successively translated and sent Chinese manuscripts, which were adopted one after another, and the telegram network was finally complete.</p>
<p>The editorial techniques of newspapers in the East and the West were novel and unique, clearly revealed, and most likely to attract readers' attention. When the editors of each newspaper saw new styles, they also had to change their old methods, gradually discarding the old-fashioned layout of plain narratives or "rain mixed with snow," and replacing them with new-style layouts, with various sizes of headlines, long lines, short lines, and cornered news interspersed between them. Readers were hooked and rushed to read them first.</p>
<p>Business Aspects</p>
<p>Each newspaper's business department was generally divided into two major sections: advertising and distribution. Commercial newspapers generally regard advertising as the lifeline. However, in order to achieve advertising development, it is necessary to promote distribution first. The fundamental issue is, of course, the content of the newspaper. If the editors work hard and are supported by most reporters, then distribution will naturally be common and advertising will naturally flourish. However, newspapers bear a cultural mission and cannot be compared to a purely commercial enterprise. Some newspapers are too commercialized, focusing only on advertising and not on news, which inevitably leads to the derisive label of "advertising newspapers." Alternatively, if they only focus on news and not on advertising, then how can they nurture the newspaper's own life? It depends on the appropriate handling by the person in charge.</p>
<p>Other Aspects</p>
<p>From the Guangxu and Xuantong years to before the Incident of 1937, each newspaper proportionally bore the expenses of the Daily Newspaper Association, which was a matter for the newspaper office to discuss. Although it was not a statutory organization, when a newly established newspaper was founded, it had to complete membership procedures for the sake of its own rights and interests. When important matters arose or major negotiations were conducted, meetings were held to make decisions and execute them jointly. The association also had a leisure club, which served as a gathering place for the writers of each newspaper to discuss topics. They gathered for a meal once every one or two weeks to foster friendship. Furthermore, news agencies supplied news, and advertising agencies supplied advertising, each with its own organization. Since they are not within the scope of this topic, I will not elaborate on them.</p>
<h3>The Earliest Electricity, Tram, and Telephone Businesses in the French Concession</h3>
<p>— Gu Jiaxi</p>
<p>The prosperity of a city is mostly built on public utilities, so the underdevelopment of a city is also due to the imperfection of public utilities. The reason why the concessions can have a prosperous urban landscape is precisely this reason. The public utilities of the Shanghai French Concession, such as electricity, trams, and telephones, have undergone many twists, turns, obstacles, and reorganizations before reaching their current state of perfection. Now, I will only briefly discuss their initial situation:</p>
<p>As for the electricity business in the Shanghai French Concession, in July of Guangxu 8 (August 1882 in the Western calendar), the Shanghai Electric Light Company set up transmission lines in the concession to supply private use. By Guangxu 19 (early 1894 in the Western calendar, the power of the Electrical Department of the Public Concession Public Works Department also came in, and a part of the electric business rights was taken away.)</p>
<p>In March of Guangxu 21 (April 1895 in the Western calendar), the Board of Directors had already decided to build its own electric light plant on the open space behind the bureau, according to the design report of engineer Junlu, to supply electric light to public institutions and roads within the concession. Later, on March 28 (April 22 in the Western calendar), Lauden, the French custodian of lighting materials from the Ministry of Construction, was commissioned to order machines in France and hire electricians.</p>
<p>The contract between the French Concession Board of Directors and the British-owned Zilaihuo Company originally expired on March 18 of Guangxu 22 (March 31, 1896 in the Western calendar), but because the bureau's electrical equipment was not yet available, it was decided on July 21 of Guangxu 21 (September 9, 1895 in the Western calendar) to extend the original contract by one year.</p>
<p>In February of Guangxu 22 (March 1896 in the Western calendar), the Board of Directors selected the manufacturer to supply the generators, and the factory building in Shanghai was also contracted for construction. In January 1897, the French electrician Bujiye arrived in Shanghai, and the equipment of the electric light plant was completed at the end of May, and officially lit up on June 1, and the official opening ceremony was held on July 14.</p>
<p>After the French Board of Directors established the Electricity Department, in addition to the streetlights and internal electricity used by the institutions, it could also supply electricity to private individuals within the concession, so it cancelled the electricity business rights of the British companies and monopolized it themselves.</p>

<h3>Me and Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Shanghai, a metropolis of world civilization!</p>
<p>That Chinese land is governed by foreigners is truly a disgrace to all Chinese people. Now, as the date of the return of the concessions approaches, Shen Bao has put out a special issue, and asked me to write an article. If I am to write about Shanghai's past, Shanghai has a magnificent history, and I fear that even a million words would not suffice. I remember there was a time when the Shanghai Municipal Government specially established a Shanghai Gazetteer Office to handle this matter, and if I am to write about Shanghai's future, for the sake of revitalizing Greater Shanghai, with thousands of threads and countless strands, I am also afraid that even a million books would not suffice. Gentlemen of the world will surely be able to shoulder these two arduous tasks, but as I am aged and frail, I can only write a little essay about my contact with Shanghai, with trivial details, based on what little I can recall.</p>
<p>My first time in Shanghai, I think I was eight years old! That was exactly sixty years ago from now. That year, my father went to Shanghai to visit a friend and suddenly fell ill at Mr. Bei's home. Because his illness was severe, Mr. Bei telegraphed our home in Suzhou. My grandmother and mother were greatly alarmed upon receiving the telegram, because unless there was something very important, they would never send a telegram, so they thought my father was sure to die. Therefore, our whole family went to Shanghai.</p>
<p>At that time, there were neither trains nor inland river steamers from Suzhou to Shanghai, only hired civilian boats, which took three days and three nights to reach Shanghai, because they traveled during the day and moored at night. (If it were a rowboat, it could travel day and night, and arrive in one day and one night.) My grandmother and mother couldn't eat on the boat, and just kept crying. They thought my father was surely out of luck, but who knew that when we arrived in Shanghai, my father's illness had already mostly healed, and the family was happy, which is self-explanatory.</p>
<p>Since my father had recovered, Mr. Bei invited us to stay at his house for a few days, and also invited us to visit various places. I don't remember the places we visited very well. I only remember that once, we took a carriage to the Huangpu Bund to see the steamships. We also went to a "General Assembly" (that was the name at the time; its location was near the present-day World Book Company) on the Fourth Avenue to have tea. The front half of that place was a teahouse, and the back half was an opium den. In the middle, there were many glass display cases, displaying all kinds of animal models, like a museum.</p>
<p>What children like are food and toys. The next time I came to Shanghai, what I liked to eat was a kind of melon-shaped steamed bun, and large almond crisps and candied winter melon from Guangdong stores. The toys were all Japanese goods. One dollar could buy a wooden box, and a wooden box contained more than twenty items, all very small and exquisite. I also had an impression at the time: the rickshaw pullers (they were not called "yellow package cars" there, only "Eastern cars," because rickshaws were introduced from Japan) wore hats that were conical in shape and made of bamboo, very much like our family's sauce jars. I would burst out laughing when I saw them.</p>
<p>After that, I didn't go to Shanghai again. After my father passed away when I was seventeen, I went to Shanghai once when I was eighteen or nineteen. By then, inland river steamers had become available, but I returned hastily and there was nothing much to remember.</p>
<p>Later, some friends and I opened a bookstore on Guanqian Street in Suzhou, called Donglai Bookstore. Because some of our classmates had gone to study in Japan, Japanese maps (alas, China at that time didn't even have slightly well-printed maps), stationery, and paper products were very exquisite and popular with Chinese people. We all mailed them from Japan in small packages for sale. At the same time, we also went to Shanghai to sell new books, in order to promote new ideas. (In fact, Shanghai was also very poor at that time, except for Liang Qichao's Shiwu Bao [Current Affairs Newspaper].) Therefore, I often ran to the Japanese stationery merchants in Hongkou to buy goods. I also went to various bookstores to search for books, because they elected me as the manager of Donglai Bookstore. (At that time, Zhang Yunbo also opened a bookstore, which seemed to be called Qiuzhi Bookstore. We were rivals.)</p>
<p>At that time, I went to Shanghai and took the entrance exam for the Nanyang Public School's normal school program, but was not admitted. Later, I went to Shanghai with a relative, Mr. So-and-so, to seek employment, but was unsuccessful. My family was poor and my parents were old, so I made a living by teaching (I stepped out of the school gate and became a teacher after my father died at seventeen), and took the civil service exams as a side job. Later, my friend Dai Menghu introduced me to Mr. Kuai Kuai in Nanjing, who was very capable of supporting younger generations, and I was deeply valued by him. At that time, he was in Shanghai preparing to establish the Jinsu Qi Printing Office, so I came to Shanghai with Mr. Wang Xiaoxu, Wang Youzhong, and others.</p>
<p>That was when I officially started living in Shanghai. That year, I met many people in Shanghai's new intellectual circles. Because the Jinsu Qi Printing Office was rented in Dengbao Lane on Baker Road, behind our window was Yan Fu's residence, and Zhang Taiyan lived in his home. We spent time with each other day and night. To the east was Ms. Xue Jinqin's residence, and Zhang Xingyan sometimes came as well. Later, Yan Fu's daughter, Wu Yanan, married Zhang Xingyan.</p>
<p>Among the newspaper people, we knew Wang Songge, the owner of the Zhongwai Ribao [China-Foreign Daily], Songge was the younger brother of Wang Rangqing (Kangnian), and although he was deaf, he was very energetic in running the newspaper. The first revolution in Shanghai's newspapers was started by the Zhongwai Ribao. Because before that, Shen Bao [Shanghai Daily News] and Xinwen Bao [News] were both printed on one side of glossy paper, but from the Zhongwai Ribao onwards, they used the current newsprint and began printing on both sides. Also, Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao used long lines that ran to the bottom, but from the Zhongwai Ribao onwards, they started using short lines. (At that time, the Shibao [Eastern Times] had not yet opened.) The Western translator of the Zhongwai Ribao was Mr. Wen Zongyao (also known as Qinpu, the current President of the Judicial Yuan), and the Eastern translator was Mr. Ye Haowu. They sat at a large table, facing each other.</p>
<p>I also met Mr. Xia Ruifang of the Commercial Press at this time, because the books of the Jinsu Qi Printing Office were urgent to publish, and there were not many Chinese-run printing houses in Shanghai. We separately submitted them to the Commercial Press and Wu Yunshao's Printing House for typesetting and printing. And we had to personally proofread them every day. Why? Because some of our books were translated by Mr. Yan Youling, such as Müller's "Science of Names" and "The Original Chapter," which were philosophical books that ordinary proofreaders could not handle. Therefore, we had to personally proofread them.</p>
<p>At that time, the scale of the Commercial Press was very small, and its address was at the corner of Beijing Road and Henan Road. According to Mr. Xia, when it was first established, the capital was only three thousand dollars. When I went to print books, there were fewer than thirty typesetting and printing workers. What kind of business did they do? They mainly reprinted English textbooks. At that time, the Chinese in Shanghai translated English, and the textbooks were also imported. The British used the same English textbooks to teach us Chinese as they used to teach Indians. The British originally regarded Chinese people as the future Indians! However, those books did not have translations. At that time, the Commercial Press added Chinese translations, so there were Chinese-English comparisons, which were the so-called Chinese-English Primers and Chinese-English Advanced books.</p>
<p>At this time, the editing industry in Shanghai gradually developed, and there were also many Japanese students who printed books in Japan and sent them to Shanghai for distribution. Therefore, Mr. Xia Ruifang wanted to expand, but he was a layman, so he often asked me, "What books can be printed?" I often encouraged him, "You can increase capital and set up an editorial office, and invite a celebrity to preside over it. There will be many books to be published in the future." He agreed but was undecided. Later, the Commercial Press burned down. Presumably, he had taken out insurance. There is a saying in Shanghai that "burning makes you rich." Sure enough, he added capital and invited Mr. Zhang Jusheng as the director of the translation and compilation office, and jumped to become a giant in Shanghai's book industry.</p>
<p>Shanghai had a Zhang's Garden, which was also a product of the times. On ordinary Sundays, it was crowded with men and women, chatting and strolling, and was always a place where famous people and guests would sip tea and talk about love. It became a meeting place. Because at that time, Ankai Lane was such an old and dilapidated place. The owner of the garden, Zhang Shuhe, was a Daoist official who had lost his position in the late Qing Dynasty. He often entertained guests there himself. Just like Mr. Chen Gongbo said in "Ancient and Modern" magazine, he was a "first-class Modan." During the Imperial Protection Era, Mr. Zhong Hui gave a speech at Zhang's Garden about military affairs. Don't think that Mr. Wu Zhihui looks old and frail now. At that time, one punch could break through the lectern and a pair of parallel bars. On that day, countless young students broke the chairs, but the owner of Zhang's Garden didn't say a word about compensation.</p>
<p>After the Jinsu Qi Printing Office dissolved, I also assisted Mr. Jiang Xingzai (named Zhiyou, respectfully called General Jiang Baqi) in the translation work at the Zhushu Garden Printing Office. I also assisted in the affairs of the Qixiu Bookstore run by Mr. Ye Haowu. These printing offices were not long-lived. First, the people who ran the translation and printing offices did not run their own printing houses, and they didn't pay much attention to distribution either. Scholars being unable to manage money was one drawback. Second, the purpose of running translation and printing offices at that time was to promote new ideas, and they didn't intend to make money. Once the money ran out, they couldn't sustain themselves and immediately closed down.</p>
<p>At that time, I returned to Suzhou, because my grandmother was old and I was her only grandson, so I didn't want to leave her. However, my grandmother soon passed away. My fellow townsman Peng Songtian introduced me to the Shandong Qingzhou Prefectural Middle School as a supervisor, through Prefect Cao Gensen of Qingzhou Prefecture, who was also from my hometown. The following year, my family moved with me. I stayed at Qingzhou Prefectural Middle School for more than two years. When Cao Gensen was transferred, I also resigned. At that time, Shanghai's Mr. Qiu Chuqing introduced me to the Shibao [Eastern Times] and Mr. Zeng Mengpu invited me to the Xiaoshuo Lin [Fiction Forest], and my lifelong writing career was set at this time.</p>
<p>I originally wanted my family to stay in Suzhou and I would stay in Shanghai alone, but many friends advised me that my family didn't need to stay in Suzhou, because the family economy was difficult and Shanghai's rent was more expensive, and they would help in other ways. I listened to them. That's when my family started living in Shanghai. I first lived on Avenue Road, then briefly lived in the Old West Gate, and then moved to Avenue Edward VII, and now I live on Avenue Foch. People say that I am a "three-Avenue" person, because the roads I live on must start with the word "Avenue."</p>
<p>When I first joined the Shibao [Eastern Times], my salary was eighty dollars a month, which was very generous. Thinking back to my friend Sun Qiyuan, who joined the Shen Bao [Shanghai Daily News] two years before me, his salary was only twenty-eight dollars a month, and even the chief editor, Mr. Zhang Yunhe, only earned more than thirty dollars a month. I earned forty dollars in the Xiaoshuo Lin [Fiction Forest] for only half a day's work. At that time, the cost of living was low, and my monthly income was one hundred and twenty dollars, which was more than enough. Moreover, I could still write novels in my spare time. However, I saved nothing. My biggest problem was that I liked to indulge in gambling and pleasure. All the hard-earned money was spent on prostitution. Therefore, my friends' advice to keep my family in Shanghai was very meaningful. Otherwise, I don't know what my family would be like now. The elders in my hometown often refuse to send young people to Shanghai alone, which shows that they are not without foresight.</p>
<p>Shanghai's prosperity is entirely due to China's internal strife. Every time there is internal strife in China, Shanghai becomes more prosperous. The earliest was during the Taiping Rebellion, when everyone fled to Shanghai to avoid the war. At that time, transportation was not very convenient. After the Xinhai Revolution, many Qing loyalists also moved to Shanghai, emptying their official coffers to buy Western houses, purchase calligraphy and paintings, and lead a life of luxury with fine wine and women. Compared to Boyi and Shuqi, who withered away in the mountains, they were naturally much more dissolute. Later, there were more and more civil wars, and more and more people fled to Shanghai to escape the war. Once they arrived in Shanghai, they settled down there and refused to go back. As a result, Shanghai's population grew more and more, and now it has a population of five million.</p>
<p>The reason why Shanghai's evil forces have grown so much is entirely due to the foreign backers. Gangsters oppress the citizens. Everyone gnashes their teeth, but they dare to be angry but dare not speak out. But half of it is also due to the Shanghai citizens themselves. Some try to become naturalized citizens. It is clear that they are Chinese people, so why do they want to obtain Western nationality? It is clear that the shops are opened by Chinese people, so why do they want to hang foreign merchants' flags? It is clear that the houses are their own, so why do they want foreign companies to collect rent? Needless to say, they originally wanted to use the power of foreigners to oppress their compatriots. At a lower level, they want to rely on the underworld gangsters. I remember there was a time when you couldn't win a lawsuit without the help of a gangster. Judges and lawyers would handle everything. There was a famous saying at the time called "a lawsuit is only half fought." They would collude with each other, sharing the profits, and what the parties involved got was still minimal. I don't know if those evils still exist after the concessions are recovered.</p>
<p>I lived on Avenue Edward VII for the longest time, for more than twenty years. That alley was called Qingxiang Lane. One end was Avenue Edward VII, and the other end was Boundary Road. Beyond Boundary Road was the North Railway Station. The area was the northernmost part of the French Concession. The entrance to Avenue Edward VII was a small marketplace, and the iron gate leading out of Boundary Road was the railway station. Because of the convenient transportation, I lived there for a long time. However, when I went back from the newspaper office on Wangping Street at night, Avenue Edward VII didn't feel very "near" to me. One year, I was robbed of my overcoat three times when I went back late at night. (Shanghai people call it "peeling a pig's hide.") The first time, after I was robbed, two days later, he mailed the pawn ticket back to the newspaper office, and also wrote a very polite letter. (This letter was published in Jing Bao [Crystal Daily].) It turned out that in the pocket of my overcoat, there was a letter someone had written to me, with a name and address on it. He could follow the map and send it to the newspaper office. I redeemed the overcoat, put it on, and in less than a month, it was robbed again. The third time, there was no letter in the overcoat pocket, and he didn't mail the pawn ticket back. Fortunately, with the help of the patrolmen of the French Concession Police Station, I was able to redeem it from the pawnshop. Before two months had passed, it was robbed again. Every time I was robbed, he pointed a gun at me, and I obediently took off my overcoat and handed it to him. I was a "non-resistance" person, because he had a gun and I didn't!</p>
<p>The patrolmen of the French Concession Police Station were very familiar with me. Because of the overcoat being robbed, I visited the police station many times. He advised me: Apply for a handgun from the police station for self-defense (there was such a regulation at the time). We'll teach you how to shoot a handgun. I didn't dare to apply. First, my eyesight is poor. By the time I take out the handgun, he would have already shot first. Second, I have many young children at home and don't want to have a handgun. Third, he only wants to rob an overcoat. I'll just give it to him and that's it. He has no intention of harming me, so why shoot him to death? But the third time I was robbed was very serious. He took off the overcoat and also wanted to take off the robe inside. Fortunately, a car came from afar, and they ran away empty-handed. However, a gold watch in my inner pocket, also of the Avenue Edward VII brand, had already been snatched away by him. In the past, every time I went home from the Shen Bao [Shanghai Daily News] late at night, the road seemed very long. I once wrote a poem at the rickshaw stand: "Avenue Edward VII is near, yet as far as the horizon." But the next line was not completed. After the gold watch of the Avenue Edward VII brand was snatched away, I finally completed the next line: "I miss you twelve hours a day."</p>
<p>After the third time I was robbed, the overcoat was gone forever. At that time, the Qi Chubei troops were stationed there, and the police station was busy guarding the border and no longer paid attention to this. After each robbery, the robbers would put it on themselves. To avoid being recognized, my wife is a bit superstitious. She said, "This overcoat has been tainted by thieves, so let's not keep it!" That overcoat was made of fox fur, with thick and warm fur. It cost more than a hundred dollars to make, but after wearing it for seven or eight years, it was only worth forty or fifty dollars when it was redeemed from the pawnshop. The Jianyang unrest was endless, and there were many robberies on the roads of Shanghai. It is said that they all came out of gambling dens. After losing money, they would come out and rob once, and then go back to the gambling dens to gamble. Therefore, gambling dens and thieves are causally related. The harm of gambling dens is not only that they create thieves, but also that they create poverty, suicide, and all kinds of tragedies. I hope that after the concessions are recovered, the first thing to do is to eliminate this stain.</p>
<p>During my ten years or so at the Shibao [Eastern Times], I didn't encounter any major disasters, but minor disasters were inevitable. Fortunately, after the Xinhai Revolution, a military officer from Jiangxi brought a handgun to the newspaper office to see me. Because the newspaper offices at that time were humble and small, everyone could run over to ask questions. Unlike the recent newspaper offices, which are towering buildings with strict gatekeepers. Among my colleagues at the Shibao [Eastern Times], there were Chen Jingzhuan, Lei Jixing, Bing Ziying, and Lin Kanghou in the past, and Wu Jian, Liu Yuting, Ge Gongzhui, and Xia Qifeng in the later years, and we all respected each other. If there were lawsuits in the newspaper office and we had to go to court, then our manager, Mr. Di Pingzi, would come forward.</p>
<p>During this period, I went to Japan once to see their newspaper offices. It was truly a case of a small witch seeing a big witch, and I was deeply ashamed. After returning to Shanghai, I wrote a book called "A Brief Account of the Inspection of Japanese News," which was published by the Commercial Press. (It has been out of print for twenty years.) However, I realized that without China being able to make its own paper, the news industry would never be able to develop. I had always been very tired of the news industry, so I left the Shibao [Eastern Times]. In less than a few years, Mr. Di Chuqing also expressed his weariness with the news industry, sold the Shibao [Eastern Times] to others, and also left the news industry.</p>
<p>It probably takes a bit of courage to get rid of a job. I see that many colleagues, after getting rid of it, never ask about it again. They all have this kind of courage. Why can't I? This is my lack of courage, and also my lack of talent. I thought that after taking the first step of leaving the news industry, the second step would be to leave Shanghai, but what was the result? I was either dealing with Shanghai publishers or dealing with the Shanghai news industry. Is this my habit or is it my destiny? Is it really like a snake-charming beggar, who has no snake to charm? There was a time when I suddenly had the urge to dust off my hat and go to Nanjing's political circles for more than two years (ten years ago). It was even more meaningless. I still came back to Shanghai to be a citizen.</p>
<p>I thought that I would never see the day when the concessions were recovered in my lifetime. But that day has actually come. Just imagine how happy and excited I am! This is not only my happiness and excitement, but also the happiness and excitement of all the citizens. I hope that the ruling class in the future, in governing this great Shanghai, will at least be better than when there were concessions, in order to be worthy of the people who recovered the concessions, and to be worthy of all the citizens who live in Shanghai. As a small citizen of Shanghai, I deeply hope that I can eat a little more, live a little more peacefully, and my wishes will be fulfilled. Confucius said: "A gentleman does not seek to be full when eating, nor does he seek to be comfortable when living." The ancients said: "My ambition in life is not to be well-fed and clothed." But I dare not be a gentleman, and I have no great ambitions. I feel that this is enough. If this can be done, I will endure death for a moment and watch with anticipation the virtuous governance of you gentlemen.</p>

<h3>Old Tales of the Songhu Railway</h3>
<p>— Shen Xiang</p>
<p>The proposal to build a railway in our country originated with foreigners. In May of the second year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing dynasty, during the Taiping Rebellion, the British assisted the Qing government. General Gordon led the Ever Victorious Army to conquer Kunshan. In December of the same year, as they were occupying Suzhou, 27 British and American merchants from Shanghai jointly petitioned Jiangsu Governor Li Hongzhang, wanting to build a 54-mile railway between Shanghai and Suzhou. Li did not approve. At the same time, British railway entrepreneur Stephenson lobbied the Qing court with a "National Railway Trunk Line Plan for China." The Qing court did not adopt it because the matter was too novel. Few Chinese people responded to it either. The following year, British merchants in Shanghai once again proposed the construction. They began building a railway of about ten miles between Shanghai and Wusong, but due to difficulty in raising funds, they stopped after buying land.</p>
<p>The implementation of the railway occurred in the first year of the Guangxu reign. The Jardine Matheson trading company considered that the business between Shanghai and Jiangwan was becoming increasingly prosperous. They built a narrow-gauge railway with a width of two feet six inches from near Old Parade Ground Road, passing through Jiangwan to the Wusong mouth. In January of the following year, the chief engineer, Mr. Marry, arrived from England with materials and four technicians. They started leveling the ground and building bridges. The construction progressed very quickly. On January 20th, they performed the ceremony of driving in the first spike. It was driven in by Mrs. Marry. The government did not prevent this. On February 14th, the laying of the tracks reached one-third of a mile, and the company hung out a small engine with the name Pioneer. When the first train ran, thousands of Chinese people went to watch. This was the beginning of the realization of the railway in our country. At the time, officials and commoners were superstitious and very alarmed by such novel things. They called it a kind of magic. The Shanghai Daotai (circuit intendant) forced the company to stop the train for a month, waiting for instructions from the Beijing government. The company was allowed to reopen the railway, but opposition arose again. When Jardine Matheson built the railway, they agreed with Chinese officials and commoners that they would not use steam power. Jardine Matheson did not keep its promise and used locomotives for power, which aroused public anger. After the trains were running, many workers were disturbed by the constant whistling of the steam whistle, and the opposition became more intense. Local officials also opposed the railway, and the situation became very serious. The company continued to push forward with the railway construction. The section from Shanghai to Jiangwan was completed and tested on June 30th. On July 1st, foreigners were invited to ride the train. On July 3rd, the railway was officially opened to traffic. There were six round trips a day. The fare was divided into first, second, and third class. There were as many as seven passenger cars. Residents of Shanghai found the matter very novel, and many went back and forth to ride the train. However, the general public thought that the train was a nuisance and had no good feelings about it. Once, the train company, together with its workers, used bamboo fences to occupy a piece of vacant land near Jiangwan belonging to a certain person, which aroused public anger. The dilapidated straw huts there were beaten down. On August 3rd, the train was testing back and forth on the north side of Jiangwan when it ran over a soldier on the road. The villagers were very frightened. Therefore, Shanghai Daotai Taiwan Shao-guang, following the instructions from Beijing, informed the British consul and asked the company to stop the train. The British consul refused. At the same time, Jiangnan Governor Shen Baozhen also informed the British consul to stop the train, but the British consul ignored him. As a result, officials and commoners hated the train even more. After much debate, the British consul replied: "Temporarily suspend operations and wait for the British minister in Yantai to discuss with Governor-General Li Hongzhang."</p>
<p>As for the current Songhu Railway, in September of the 22nd year of Guangxu (early October 1896), Liangjiang Governor and Nanyang Minister Zhang Zhidong cited the example of the Beiyang Military Railway and proposed to build the Wusong-Nanjing Railway. That month, the Jiangnan Governor again joined forces with Hubei Governor Wang Wenshao to request the construction of the Songhu line first. The imperial court approved it and appointed Sheng Xuanhuai as the director-general. The project began on the 16th day of the first month of the 23rd year of Guangxu (February 17, 1897) and was completed on the 18th day of the sixth month (August 5th) of the following year. The opening ceremony was held the next day, and the railway was opened to traffic on the 16th day of the seventh month (September 1st). From demolition to reconstruction, twenty-one years had passed, which can be said to have been a long and arduous journey.</p>
<h3>The Origin of the Shanghai British Concession</h3>
<p>— Le Xiuliang</p>
<p>In 1685 (the 24th year of the Kangxi reign), China opened its maritime borders, and Shanghai established the Jianghai Customs, allowing foreign trade. However, in 1723 (the first year of the Yongzheng reign), an order was issued restricting foreign merchants to trade only in Guangzhou. Consequently, Shanghai was closed again. At that time, British merchants were very dissatisfied with the narrow market in Guangzhou and repeatedly sent people to Shanghai to investigate and ascertain the opinions of Chinese officials, but without any results. In 1793 and 1806, the British government specifically sent special envoys to China, repeatedly requesting the opening of a port, but they were all rejected. In 1832, the East India Company also sent Lin Tese, accompanied by an interpreter, northward from Macau, heading towards Shanghai. On June 21st, Lin Tese, with great effort, finally met with officials at the Tianhou Temple and presented a request. Two weeks later, he was forced to leave Shanghai and head north. After returning home, in his report, he claimed that Shanghai was the best trading port. As a result, the British became even more determined to open up Shanghai as a hub for their country's goods in the North China market.</p>
<p>In 1840 (the 20th year of the Daoguang reign), Britain started the so-called Opium War in Guangzhou. Naval Commander Parker and Officer Gough led warships, steamers, and 4,000 ground troops to invade the coast northward. In 1842 (April of the 22nd year of the Daoguang reign), Zhapu was captured. On June 9th, British troops arrived at the Wusong estuary. At that time, Governor Niu Jian oversaw troops while General Doushan defended the east fort of Wusong, and Commander Chen Huacheng defended the west fort. Chen Huacheng, with his experience, calmly responded, and the British troops repeatedly failed. Then, they shifted their target, using flying cannons to attack the east fort. Halfway through, Doushan, terrified and helpless, abandoned his armor and fled into Baoshan City with the Henan Adjutant. The British troops then landed from the east fort and concentrated their forces to fiercely attack the west fort. Chen Huacheng bravely resisted but unfortunately was hit by a bullet and died. The west fort ultimately fell. The British troops, taking advantage of their victory, attacked Baoshan. Niu Jian abandoned the city and fled again, and Baoshan was taken by the British troops.</p>
<p>When Shanghai received the alarm, officials such as the Sub-Prefect secretly fled, and merchants and residents evacuated. On the 19th, British troops took Shanghai directly by land and water, encountering no resistance along the way. They entered the city through Jingmen and stationed at the City God Temple. A few days later, a large contingent of British troops arrived from Hong Kong. At that time, the Qing government wanted to negotiate peace with Britain, willing to redeem Shanghai for 30 million yuan, but it was rejected. On the 23rd, British troops again departed from Shanghai to participate in the war in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, bombarding Zhenjiang and approaching Nanjing. On August 9th, the Chinese side announced a ceasefire and negotiated peace with Britain.</p>
<p>On August 29th, Chinese Imperial Commissioner Ili Bu and British plenipotentiary Pottinger signed the Treaty of Nanjing on the HMS Cornwallis, stipulating the opening of five ports for trade, marking the beginning of the first unequal treaty between China and foreign countries. On November 17th of the same year, Shanghai formally announced the opening of the port. The first consul was Balfour, and the consulate was located in the large residence of the Gu family in Xijiazhai.</p>
<p>On October 8th of the following year, both parties signed the Supplementary Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, also known as the Treaty of Humen, at Humen, which had even further provisions than the Treaty of Nanjing. The treaty only stated that British people could rent houses to live in and lease land to build houses in Shanghai and other five ports. This needed to be deliberated and decided by the local officials of each place and the British consul, taking into account the local conditions, and foreigners could not overstep these boundaries to prevent misunderstandings with the local people...</p>
<p>Later, on June 26, 1858, China and Britain signed the Treaty of Tianjin, which also only meant "unimpeded trade."</p>
<p>The term "concession" first appeared in a formal treaty in the Yantai Treaty signed between China and Britain on September 13, 1876 (the second year of the Guangxu reign). The second paragraph of its third article states: "In the old and new ports, except for the established foreign concessions, there is no need to discuss them. In places where concessions have not been established, the British consulate should consult with the consuls of various countries and discuss with the local officials to demarcate the boundaries of the places where foreigners reside." This recognized the existence of concessions, but the so-called concession was originally just a designated area where foreigners were allowed to reside, equivalent to a foreign residential area.</p>
<p>Since Shanghai was opened as a British trading port, there would inevitably be lawsuits between British merchants and between British merchants and Chinese people. Regarding the handling of such lawsuits, there were provisions for so-called consular jurisdiction. The Treaty of Humen stated that "the method of punishing British merchants shall be determined by British regulations and laws, issued to the supervisors for implementation, and the method of punishing Chinese people shall be based on Chinese law..." Although this article did not specifically stipulate consular jurisdiction, it clearly stipulated the duties of consuls in handling lawsuits. Article 16 of the Treaty of Tianjin stipulated that "British people who commit crimes shall be punished by Britain, and Chinese people who bully or disturb British people shall be punished by Chinese local officials. In cases involving the two countries, both parties must jointly and fairly investigate and judge." By this time, British consular jurisdiction in China was clearly stipulated in detail.</p>
<p>Shortly after the British consul arrived in Shanghai, he set his sights on establishing a concession. Because the treaty did not clearly stipulate the method of leasing land, the British consul made an unreasonable demand for land, which was not allowed under Chinese law, and no agreement was reached. Later, the British consul and the Shanghai Circuit Intendant negotiated several times. Finally, on November 29, 1845, Circuit Intendant Gong Muyuan published a public notice in his own name. He and the British consul "agreed upon in accordance with the treaty." The notice stated: "Now, considering the sentiments of the people and taking into account the local conditions of Shanghai, the land north of the Yangjingbang and south of Lijiazhuang is designated to be leased to British merchants for the construction of houses and residences. All agreed-upon regulations are hereby promulgated as follows, and all must abide by them without violation."</p>
<p>Although the name Yangjingbang still exists, it was filled in 1915 and is now known as Edward Road. Lijiazhuang is now the area of Beijing Road. The eastern boundary was recognized as the Huangpu River, and the western boundary was not clearly defined. This area was mostly cultivated farmland, with some lower-lying wetlands, crisscrossed by streams and covered with reeds in summer. At that time, the land price was approximately 15,000 to 35,000 cash coins per mu.</p>
<p>Following the above notice, 23 land regulations were also promulgated. The most significant point was the confirmation and repeated recognition of the Chinese people as the "owners of the land," that is, China's sovereignty over the land. The Chinese government collected a small amount of land tax annually, and the land deeds needed to be stamped by the Chinese government to have legal effect.</p>
<p>On September 24, 1846, the four boundaries of the concession were defined: east to the Huangpu River, south to the Yangjingbang, west to Jielu (now Henan Road), and north to Lijiazhuang (now Beijing Road). The total area was 830 mu.</p>
<p>On November 27, 1848, British Consul Alcock and Shanghai Circuit Intendant Lin Gui signed an agreement, revising the boundaries. The southeastern boundary was the Yangjingbang Bridge, the northeastern boundary was the first ferry at Suzhou Road, the southwestern boundary was the Zhoujingbang, and the northwestern boundary was the Su residence on the Suzhou Creek. The total area increased to 2,820 mu.</p>
<h3>The Origin of the Shanghai French Concession</h3>
<p>— Yu Xiuru</p>
<p>(1) The Process of Creation</p>
<p>Since the end of the Opium War in 1842 (the 22nd year of the Daoguang reign), when China and Britain signed the so-called "Treaty of Nanjing," the great powers, taking advantage of China's open door, came to sign trade treaties. France naturally "did not want to lag behind." Subsequently, on December 12, 1843, it specially sent Plenipotentiary Minister Lagrené, accompanied by staff and three warships, to China. On August 13, 1844, they arrived in Macau. After Lagrené arrived, he negotiated with China. After two months, on October 24th of the same year, the Treaty of Whampoa was signed. On August 25th of the following year, the instruments of ratification were formally exchanged in Macau.</p>
<p>The Treaty of Whampoa had a total of 36 articles. Article 2 stated: "All French people residing in the five ports according to Article 2, regardless of the number of people, shall be allowed to rent houses and warehouses for storing goods, or lease land to build their own houses and businesses... Local officials of various places shall consult with the consular officials to determine the land suitable for French people to live and build on... Chinese officials shall prevent inland people from raising rents excessively, and French consular officials shall also carefully prevent their own nationals from forcibly suppressing rents."</p>
<p>The first French Consul, Montigny, formally presented a note to the Chinese Daotai, first citing the provisions of Article 22 of the Treaty of Whampoa, and then explaining that "due to the requests of nationals to lease land, according to the treaty, and after studying the location that should be leased, it is the right bank of the Yangjingbang, from the village on the edge of the city to the location needed in the future. Please give the same treatment as other countries, immediately designate the scope of the Shanghai French Concession, and send a notary to estimate the value of the land to be purchased by the Rémi trading house for French merchants, and immediately send someone to inspect the place with Rémi to demarcate the four boundaries."</p>
<p>Daotai Lin could not withstand his pressure and urgently sent people to contact Montigny, coercing Chinese landlords to cede their land. Finally, on January 8, 1849, they succeeded, leasing a total of 2 mu, 3 fen, 8 li, and 5 hao of land, totaling 457 yuan and 3,758 cash coins. This land leasing negotiation took eight months. Thus, the first foundation had been laid, and the basic form of the French Concession was already in place.</p>
<p>This land lease notice was signed and exchanged by China and France on April 6, 1849. Daotai Lin issued the official posting, and the determined land boundaries were: south to the city moat outside the North Gate of Shanghai, north to the Yangjingbang, west to the Guandi Temple at Zhujia Bridge, and east to the Guangdong Chaozhou Guild Hall along the river to the eastern corner of the Yangjingbang.</p>
<p>In this way, the French Concession was established. At this time, the total number of French people in Shanghai by the beginning of 1850 was only ten. On June 10, 1852, Montigny, the founder of the Shanghai French Concession, was finally recalled to his country. Now, there is a Montigny Embankment Road in the French Concession from Nanyang Bridge to the Great World, which is to commemorate him.</p>
<p>(2) The First Expansion</p>
<p>On May 25, 1861, French Consul Étienne received instructions from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stipulating that the French Royal Mail Steamship Company had agreed with the Ministry of Finance to exclusively operate the transportation of mail in Vietnam. Because there was a major route, it was necessary to connect with Shanghai. The Steamship Company needed to set aside 30 mu of land along the river in the Shanghai French Concession for its use, and Étienne was ordered to proceed immediately. After receiving the order, Étienne thought of the opportunity to expand the concession, so on September 11, 1861, he reported to the French Minister Bourboulon in Beijing, meaning: "The plan to expand the concession has reached the time for implementation... It is best to proceed through Prince Gong in Beijing, asking him to issue an edict to execute the cession of the land outside the Xiaodongmen."</p>
<p>Minister Bourboulon approved Étienne's request and immediately contacted Prince Gong. On August 1st, he directly sent a note to the Zongli Yamen, requesting that the Shanghai local officials be instructed to designate a piece of land of about 34 mu along the river and that the Shanghai Daotai should immediately issue a notice to the people, stating that the land that France could lease was from the Xiaodongmen adjacent to the county seat, directly connecting the small river along the Huangpu River as the southern boundary.... Three days after the note was issued, the Zongli Yamen replied that it had sent a letter to the Governor of Jiangsu to deliberate and handle the matter quickly. Then, on October 17th, Minister Bourboulon ordered Étienne, saying, "The south side of the French Concession can be extended to the river outside the Xiaodongmen, all the way to the land along the Huangpu River." At the same time, he attached the edict issued by Prince Gong to the Governor of Jiangsu, asking Étienne to hand it to the Daotai in person for immediate execution.</p>
<p>Étienne further sent a note to Daotai Wu on October 29, 1861, asking him to faithfully execute it. Daotai Wu, after receiving the note, immediately issued a notice the next day, acknowledging the expansion of the French Concession.</p>
<p>The purchase of land by the French Steamship Company was thus successful, with a total of 34 mu purchased. Another 6 mu were purchased at the old French naval dock in Wusong. Later, the Steamship Company abandoned this land, which was then respectively taken over by the Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas and the Banque de l'Indochine. This expansion extended the shoreline of the French Concession along the Bund by 650 meters, and the concession area also expanded to 59 hectares.</p>
<p>(3) The Second Expansion</p>
<p>Before the second bloodbath at the Siming Public Cemetery, the French Concession authorities had the ambition to expand the concession. On March 4, 1898, French Consul General Basset sent an official document to Daotai Cai Jun, proposing negotiations to expand the French Concession, but there were no results at the time.</p>
<p>On May 12, 1898, French Consul General Basset telegraphed General Manager Boullard, stating that he intended to establish a French Concession in Wusong, and asked all directors to express their opinions. The French Board of Directors unanimously approved Basset's proposal at the regular meeting on June 1, 1898. At the regular meeting on June 22, 1898, it was also decided to send a letter to Consul Basset, asking him to expedite the negotiations to expand the concession.</p>
<p>After the second bloodbath at the Siming Public Cemetery, the French took the opportunity to present the desire to expand the concession as a specific request. At that time, the scope of expansion requested by the French side included the area of Sixteen Pulis, the area outside the West Gate of Shanghai County, the area of Baxianqiao west of the French Concession, a part of Pudong, and a part of Wusong. The Chinese authorities actually agreed to this proposal in principle on July 24, 1898. In June 1899, French Consul General Basset and the Chinese Governor-General of Liangjiang secretly agreed on the boundaries of the concessions to be expanded and made a memorandum for record.</p>
<p>At this time, Britain and France in Europe were in conflict over various rights issues, so the opposition to the expansion of the French Concession was not from the owner, China. Britain repeatedly protested to the French side about France's request to expand the concession and issued warning notes to the Chinese government. The Chinese side could not stand the trouble, so it instructed the Chinese Minister to Britain to request the British Foreign Office to transfer the case to direct negotiations between Britain and France.</p>
<p>Britain repeatedly dealt with the issue with a tough attitude, and France finally conceded. However, the French diplomatic means were very clever. When the environment was unfavorable, it did not hesitate to suspend the expansion plan that had been negotiated in order to ease the atmosphere with the British. After efforts from all sides, the expansion of the French Concession finally succeeded.</p>
<p>In June 1899, Basset was actually able to agree with the commissioners sent by the Governor-General of Liangjiang on the new site for the French Concession to be expanded and made a memorandum for record. According to the contents of this memorandum, the new boundaries of the French Concession were: "North to Beichangbang (now Section 4 of Avenue Édouard VII), west to Guandi Temple at Gujiazhai (now the northern section of Rue Lupan and Route Boileau), south to Datiebang (now Route Paul Beau, Route Boileau, and Route Pichon), and east to Chenghebang (now the southwestern section of Minquan Road)."</p>
<p>On December 28, 1899, the French Minister to China sent a note to the Zongli Yamen, requesting that the Governor-General of Liangjiang and the Shanghai Daotai be quickly instructed to comply. The Governor-General of Liangjiang then sent Commissioner Yu Mou and foreign advisor Ferguson to Shanghai to assist Daotai Yu Lianyuan in demarcating the boundaries. After receiving the order, Daotai Yu, together with Advisor Ferguson and others, negotiated various conditions for the newly expanded concession with French Consul Basset. Afterwards, at the request of Consul General Basset, Daotai Yu issued a notice on January 27, 1900, announcing the expanded boundaries of the French Concession, which were: east to Chenghebang, west to Guandi Temple at Gujiazhai, south to Dinggong Bridge, Yangong Temple, and Datiebang, and north to Beichangbang.</p>
<p>The second expansion of the French Concession was successful.</p>
<p>In 1900, the total area of the French Concession was only 1,023 mu, approximately 69 hectares. The newly added area was 1,112 mu, approximately 75 hectares. The combined area of the old and new concessions was 2,135 mu, approximately 144 hectares. At this time, the French Concession had more than doubled in size compared to before.</p>
<p>On July 30, 1943, the entire French Concession was returned, and this part of the land returned to the embrace of our country.</p>
<h3>The Past Chinese Ratepayers Associations in the Two Concessions</h3>
<p>— Yang Nianmu</p>
<p>On January 9th of this year, our country automatically joined the war, and our friendly nation, Japan, immediately announced its moral stance of returning the concessions in China and abolishing extraterritoriality. Other friendly nations, such as France and Italy, were not far behind and made similar expressions. These statements were subsequently put into practice one by one. Recently, the governments of Japan, France, and Italy have successively concluded agreements with our authorities to return the administrative rights of the Shanghai International Settlement, the French Concession, and the Tianjin Italian Concession. From today onwards, China will no longer have the shameful name of "concession" and will regain its original face of independence and autonomy. This is something to be celebrated! At the same time, the Chinese Ratepayers Associations of the two concessions, which have strived for more than 20 years to "develop concession autonomy, seek common interests, and equal treatment," have also honorably retired after successfully completing their missions. Here, in addition to expressing our deep respect to the past leaders of the association, we would like to briefly describe the past history of the association, hoping to be a glimpse into the clamor for the return of concessions and to serve as a mirror for the future political participation of the people, "continuing what is good and changing what is not good."</p>
<p>International Settlement</p>
<p>The participation of Chinese people in the Shanghai Municipal Council did not start with the Chinese Ratepayers Association. As early as 1866, Chinese commercial organizations and others had elected three representatives as advisory bodies for matters relating to Chinese residents, but they were purely advisory in nature. The issue of Chinese political participation was first formally raised in 1906 by Mr. Yu Qiaqing, who proposed to organize a Chinese Merchants Advisory Committee to represent the interests of various guilds. Although the board of directors of the Municipal Council expressed their approval, it was opposed by the foreign Ratepayers Meeting and did not materialize. The second time was in the fourth year of the Republic of China (1915), when the Chinese government and the consular corps discussed the draft treaty for the extension of the International Settlement, hoping to establish an advisory committee before the addition of Chinese directors to the Municipal Council, which would be organized by five representatives elected by officials and civilians. Although this draft treaty was accepted by the ratepayers, it was never approved, and the advisory committee's plan was never implemented.</p>
<p>In the eighth year of the Republic of China, the Chinese Ratepayers Association shouted the slogan "No Representation, No Taxation" in opposition to tax increases. As a result, the foreign Ratepayers Meeting allowed the establishment of a Chinese Ratepayers Association and formed a "Chinese Advisory Committee" in the following year. The committee had five members, who were elected by the Chinese Ratepayers Association, but they had no real power and were only for advisory purposes.</p>
<p>In the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, the "May Thirtieth" Massacre occurred, and the entire Chinese Advisory Committee resigned on June 6th to show their protest. During the negotiations, the Chinese government also raised the demand for the Municipal Council to accommodate Chinese directors. After years of compromise, foreigners began to change their long-standing attitude of ignoring Chinese public opinion, and opinions gradually converged. In the fifteenth year, the foreign Ratepayers Meeting passed a proposal to establish three Chinese directors and six Chinese committee members. These directors and committee members officially took office in March of the seventeenth year. In the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, the number of Chinese directors increased to five, and the number of Chinese committee members also increased to nine, and so on until today.</p>
<p>The Ratepayers Association had very strict restrictions on membership qualifications (must have resided in the International Settlement for five years, have assets of 500 taels, and pay more than 10 taels in taxes annually). Its power organ was the General Assembly of Representatives, which had a total of 81 representatives, including 27 members of the Ratepayers Association and 27 members each from fellow-villager industrial groups. The Chinese directors and committee members were elected from these 81 people. According to a survey in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, there were more than 10,000 qualified ratepayers in the International Settlement, but only about 3,000 members of the two ratepayers associations. Moreover, these 3,000 members could only elect 27 representatives to participate in the 81-member General Assembly of Representatives, which greatly deviated from the original intention of ratepayers participating in politics. No wonder some people said that the Ratepayers Association, at best, only represented the anger of a small number of the bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>French Concession</p>
<p>As for the French Concession, although the "French Concession Organizational Law" stipulated that "the Consul General, in consultation with the Daotai, shall appoint one or several Chinese leaders, who, after being approved by the Conseil d'Administration Municipale, may attend meetings and express opinions, but shall not have the right to vote," before the Republic of China used 800 hectares of land-rights to obtain two directors who could not attend the board meetings in the third year of the Republic of China, there had never been a Chinese representative participating in the administrative affairs of the Conseil d'Administration Municipale.</p>
<p>In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, when the prestige of the National Revolutionary Army had not yet reached Shanghai, the General Manager of the French Concession, in accordance with the provisions of the Sino-French Agreement of the third year of the Republic of China, added two Chinese directors to the board of directors, which was the beginning of the political participation of Chinese people in the French Concession. The Chinese Ratepayers Association was created in response to this. The membership qualifications were slightly more reasonable than those in the International Settlement, and there were provisions that those who were illiterate, engaged in improper occupations, had been criminally punished, or had been deprived of their civil rights could not participate.</p>
<p>As a result of the continuous efforts of the Ratepayers Association, the number of Chinese directors was increased to five in the following year (the sixteenth year of the Republic of China), and six advisors were added to the Conseil d'Administration Municipale. From the nineteenth year of the Republic of China onwards, the number of advisors was increased to nine, and thereafter, the Chinese Ratepayers Association became the sole organ representing the Chinese people within the concession.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that the Chinese Ratepayers Associations in the two concessions in the past had already possessed a rudimentary form of popular political participation. However, the power could not be fully exerted, and they only represented a small part of the citizens. This was their shortcoming. In recent times, the call for the establishment of public opinion organs in Shanghai has been increasing. We sincerely hope that those in charge will think from multiple perspectives and expand the powers granted to them as much as possible, so that they can truly live up to their name and fulfill their mission. Millions of citizens in the city have high hopes for this.</p>
