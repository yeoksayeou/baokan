<p>社評</p>
<h3>官商分野</h3>
<p>國民政府七日發表命令，（見昨日本報第四版）其要點爲：（一）查得上海近來有大規模投機囤積重要物資情事。（二）派陳之碩，袁愈侄·趙叔雍，陳允文四氏秉公澈查。（三）凡金融機關主要職員作投機買賣者，如係官辦暫停營業，立即改組；如係商辦即予封閉。（四）凡經營投機買賣，操縱市價，擾亂市塲者，查明確實後，不問何人，均即呈報國防會議決定特別治罪，其查獲之物資，悉數沒收。</p>
<p>我們再分析這一道命令，第一點是澈查的動因；第二點是主持澈查人員：第三點是澈查的對象；第四點是懲處辦法。已經很具體的昭示一切。我們認爲這命令的頒佈，是國民政府修明政治，安定民生的腎明表示。我們站在人民立塲，於感動之餘，略申管見：</p>
<p>第一，政府旣謂「查得上海近來有大規模投機囤積重要物資情事」。那末，事前政府必已得到充分的情報，不過在未經查得充分證據以前，不加直指其名而已。所以這種大規模囤積案件，經過秉公澈查後，公告社會，僅爲時間問題。在這澈查過程中，我們盼望全滬市民，必須遵守國家法令，進而協助政府推行法令。</p>
<p>第二，金融機關，資金在握，運用之間，最關出入，政府所以特別提出金融機關爲澈查對象者，意即在此。目前上海金融機關，爲數很多，如何抽查或按家澈查，自有澈查大員成竹在胸，加以決定。我們所可附帶指出者，凡是商業銀行或企業公司中的董事長，董事，或大股東，如爲現任官吏，如爲化名參加，在公務人員嚴禁兼營商業的法令之下，爲避嫌疑起見，應令立刻辭退。官商分野，必須嚴格劃清，才足以防杜日後之流弊。</p>
<p>第三，上海區域之廣，囤積之多，僅僅政府的澈查，耳目容有不周，人力容有不足，爲澈底澄清起見，有賴於社會人士檢舉者，更爲積極而有效。我們盼望社會上素孚聲望的公正人士，自動組織機構，專門接受檢舉囤積案件，經過調查確實後，移交政府處辦。這一工作，與政府的澈查，並不衝突。而是協助政府，相輔相成。諒爲政府所同意，社會人士所願爲者。其次，公共租界區域內，爲大有力者囤積的大本營，在租界未交還以前，盼望友邦當局參加協助這一重要工作的實施。同時，如果發現日方人士也有囤積情事，更希望友邦當局同樣的取締。</p>
<p>第四，「秉公澈查」，責任是何等重大，我們可以說，這次政府樹立威信，與民更始，其成功的關鍵，就在這四個字。惟有「大公無私」，才可以收到澈查的眞實效果，深信政府具有決心之後，對於銓衡人選，自然特別愼重。政府對之固深倚畀，而我們人民的期望更爲殷切。我們更有不能已於言者，澈查大員中，或爲主管金融事業與工商各業，或爲主管上海市政的高級官吏，平素與金融界主要職員，或許相互熟識，在道種環境之下，尤須有破除情面先公後私的精神，以孚衆望，以盡職責。</p>
<p>此外，對於澈查的對象，應當不限於金融機關，我們已在本月六日的社評中建議，倉庫中的囤貨，保險公司的倉庫保戶，都是澈查的對象。至於澈查結果，在政府命令中，已有嚴厲的規定，我們暫不贅述。</p>
<p>最後，我們鄭重的申言，物價問題，是目前最嚴重的民生問題；取締囤積居奇，是目前抑平物價最有效的治標辦法，今政府旣昭示決心，取締囤積，我們全民衆必須全力擁護政府這一主張的貫澈！</p>

<h3>戰時經濟與中日合作　（一）　梅實業部長對日記者談話</h3>
<p>國民政府在一月九日參戰之後，向確立決戰體制　進，同時，在政治，軍事，經濟各方面與日本進行全面的合作。日本方面，已經實現了交還在華專管租界，撤廢治外法權，首先交還北京公使館區城，移讓收買配給統制權等。這中日關係的一體化，超越了從來的外交關係而確立「運命協同體」。通過中日的經濟合作而構成的這種協同體，今正具體的目恒久的着着實現中。此次以設立全國商業統制總會爲起點的中日經濟合作，依從中國方面所希望的「分工合作」之旨經，各方面完全重新改組開始，而軍需資源的開發，重工業，輕工業的新創，復興，復活大東亞的交易關係等，也漸見具體化。和平地區的經濟復興，並也引起了非和平地區的嚮往，用經濟力實現全面和平的時期，已露出了一綫曙光。記者某日獲與實業部梅部長特別會見的機會，得聞國府決戰經濟的進展，與中日合作的新開展以及經濟的全面和平之瞻望。以下爲與梅部長所作之問答：</p>
<p>本社問：第一，我們想先知道確立決戰經濟的順序。最近，自商業部門開始似已着手改組，從此方面着手，依怎樣順序，才能確立决戰經濟呢？請概括的加以說明。</p>
<p>梅部長答：這可以分做二部分說。此次確立戰時經濟體制的最大目標，第一，在增加生產，第二，向前綫供給軍需物資，這是此次最大的目標。爲了增加生產，現在第一着手的是緩和統制。例如：一面縮小上海地區搬出人的限制範圍，使與內地間的物資交流得以圓滑進行。一面並健全經濟機構新的商業機構現在可分爲三級，第一是同業公會，第二是各業同業公會的聯合會，這是第二層的機構，第三是最高的全國商業統制總會。</p>
<p>同業公會是最下層的細胞，是基本的機構，以縣市爲單位。其次，各縣市各業的同業公會集中起來，例如，集中全國烟草業的同業公會而組織烟草同業公會的聯合會。聯合會的種類，可因煤業，烟草，綿紗布等各種不同的種類而分別組織各業的聯合會。</p>
<p>問：這種翻大約有多少呢？</p>
<p>答：大的有二十幾種。把這聯合會作爲會員而統合起來的，就是全國商業統制總會。</p>
<p>問：那麼日本商社似乎不加入商業統制總會了。但日本商社可否加入聯合會及同業公曾呢？</p>
<p>答：日本商社也可以參加全國商業統制總會。中日兩方面的商社都可以加入成爲會員。例如，單由日本人方面所組成的聯合會此聯合會也可以翻入爲統制會的會員。道可以分爲三個階層，最下層的同業公會，以區別日本人的與中國人的同業公會爲原則，因各業種類的不同而分別設立日本方面的組合，與中國方面的公會。至組成中層聯合會的時候，則各自組織各業的聯合會。於是雙方合併起來組成最上層的統制總會。日本人，中國人都須絕對的全部參加。若日本人不參加，則不能成立全國的統制</p>
<p>問：現在的同業公會整理完竣，而付以全權的時候，物資移動限制條例即將撤廢罷。</p>
<p>答：是的，完傭之日，即行撤廢。</p>

<h3>德國的潛水艦新戰術　使英美對之大感苦悶</h3>
<p>（柏林守山特派員二十七日發）德國潛水艦戰的攻擊戰術，最近採用多數潛水艦的集團戰法，在發表的公報上，出現了「潛水艦集團」這一新名詞。敵方也以爲種種議論的對象。例如：據倫敦發出的美聯社通訊，用於襲擊北大西洋護　船團的德國新編潛水艦隊，在一個集團攻擊敵人的時候，別一集團則待機於水平綫的彼方，準備輪流加以攻擊。這集團攻擊戰術，是德國因苦於船員不足，及有訓練的潛水艦指揮者的不足，而採用的一種妙策。由此，一個優秀的潛水艦司令官，可以指揮十數隻潛水艦組成的大集團。</p>
<p>最近北大西洋的潛水艦戰，在五日之間，擊沉了從美國進向英本土的大護航船幽三十三隻，二十萬四十噸，這大槪也是用集團攻擊所成就的戰果。德國海軍當局似充滿自信地稱：「從過去的經騐，所得到的新戰術」。</p>
<p>英美方面估計現在德國所有的潛水艦總數，實際上在前綫活動的有三分之一，其餘三分之二，因袖給修理而停留於基地，或航行於海程中。而在前次大戰中，德國潛水艦最多的時候，僅有二百只，即據英美的估計，三分之二殘留於基地，則德國潛水艦從北冰洋至南大西洋的海面上追擊敵船的尚有不少。英國空軍雖反覆轟炸法國海岸的德潛水艦基地，或德國國內的迭船所所在地，但德國潛水艦數量仍日見增加，平均以一日半造一只的速度，大量生產中。因須遠航至加勒比安海，南美洋面，或南菲好望角的南方洋面，故潛水艦艦形亦造成大型而具長距離的航續可能，水力亦增至〇〇裡，在水面上航行的時候，此普通護航船團有二倍的速力。故敵方對此極爲恐懼。</p>
<p>潛水艦對策的束手</p>
<p>對此海上兵站綫的成脅，英美方面的對策如何呢？積極的攻擊潛水艦，驅逐潛水艦的方法，或有效而適切的新武器，迄未有何新發見。此在英美的報紙上，亦常坦然自認。因此，民間相繼對本國政府加以非難，鞭韃和警告，羣情騷然，成爲國內重大問題之一。唐一的方法，僅充分裝配護送船團用的聽音機，魚雷，及大砲等作爲積極的攻擊武器，一面幷建造特殊驅遂艦，加强搜索及攻擊潛水艦用的飛機，但這些方法都沒有絕對的自信。所以對潛水艦作戰的努力，大部分集中於消極的建造新船以補充損失的方法。上次在華盛頓召開的「潛水艦防禦會議」，和倫教舉行的每週一次已有二十次之多的「潛水艦對策會議，」徒然面面相覷，束手無策。</p>
<p>爲袖充被擊沈的商船，應建造那一種型的新船呢？這是他們最感到頭痛的一件事。最近英國每日郵報的某記者，發表了一篇新建的耐潛水艦貨物船的試乘記，這船有知道敵潛水艦所在的特別裝置，備有大砲數門，武裝亦經强化，兼具高度的速率與回轉性。並稱現在正開始這種型的船隻的大量生產。</p>
<p>美國的伍特華斯及由開皮基的造船業者連名提出「無綫電操縱的潛水貨物船」，這是葉卷型的船體，潛沈於水中，由驅逐艦用無綫電操縱行使，其特微　構迭簡單，迭價低廉，鐵材的使用也極少，毌須船員操縱。據說已試造一艘，從佛洛利達不用船員航行至華盛頓。英國有旁氏造船技師者，指摘護航船團制徒然爲德國集團攻擊的目標，而主張大量建造可以單獨航行的二萬噸快速貨物船。</p>
<p>他所提議的船，把露出於水面上的上部　造儘可能的减低，使敵難於發見。船體具有防禦水雷的特別構造，並配以强力的武裝。與護送船團的把船體露出於水面而緩航，正相反對，他主張這是補救日前完全破產的護送船團制的唯一方法。</p>
<p>當然，建造這種船隻，必須把造船所加以根本的改革，故造船企業家們爲了固守陳法以獲得利潤，極猛烈的反對這提議，並指　待這方針的變更成功，已經失却了時　的要素了。最近英政府似已爲此說所動，據海相亞歷山大在　會的報告，已發出命令大量建造單獨航行用的快速大型武裝商船。反之，美國尚沒有受到像本國那樣的打擊，所以不變原來方針，依然照原定計劃大量造船。</p>
<p>上述德國潛水艦戰增加了擊沈船隻的噸數，同時，因爲英美的造船能力與軍事計劃，在歐洲戰爭上將發生一種新的局面。美國生活雜誌：稱</p>
<p>「船腹的損失，是對於所有的攻擊計劃的一種制定機。我反軸心軍的戰塲，遠隔在海的那一面，所以每一武裝兵士的運輪，需要十噸的船腹，而每月又必須保持一•五噸的船腹。潛水艦是德國所有最好的武器，因而這潛水艦戰在今後將更趨激烈罷！」</p>
<p>讀該誌之言，孕育着潛水艦戰前途難以逆睹的重大要因。但敵人的造船能力，尤其是美國的，若予以片面過小的評價，則將造成重大的失敗，關於此點，軸心國自應加以十分的警戒。美國的蘭特少將在上月十九日會見記者時稱：</p>
<p>「美國在二月份中新造貨物船百二十三萬噸，迭成了每月的最高記錄，平均每天有新船四隻進水，在未來的五月份，每天平均將能造船五只，所以本年中預定的總造船噸數爲千八百八十九萬噸，在一九四四年，將實現年產二千萬噸的計劃。」</p>
<p>倘然這數字有實現的可能，那麼，即使不是爲英美對潛水艦對策的焦慮所驅，大槪亦不出於第二戰綫計劃的籌備罷！這數字的眞實性姑置勿論，即令預算衹有一半實現的可能，而德國維持其每月平均擊沈敵船六十萬噸的記錄，由英美的造船率　已進越德國的　沈率，如欲盡數加以擊沈，正如百年待河之淸，談何容易。故德國潛水艦以全新面目開始新攻勢，這是出於必然的要求。同時，這海面戰綫的活躍，直接給與東部及北非各戰綫以重大的影響。由向例看來，北大西洋解凍的四五月左右，是德國潛水艦隊擊沈定期船噸數飛躍增加的季節。未來的德國潛水艦隊活躍，隱藏着戰爭的將來之鍵，極堪注目（翔：譯自三月二十九日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>評言　金融界實業界的人才問題</h3>
<p>「才難」是自古以來的一句名言。今日金融業與企業之發展，表面上可說是十分煊赫，前途好像是很可樂觀，可是事業進展，而學問技術不能隨之前進，前途是非常可慮的。</p>
<p>在目前任何一種事業，一家工廠，一個公司，可設資本不足慮，贏利不必說，最大的病源，是人才空虛，達於極點，尤其是幹部技術人才，十分缺乏，所以每辦一事，每舉一業，最感痛苦的，便是人才太寥落了。</p>
<p>我們　以爲政府機關或公共團體，在遴選人才一個問題上，必須認定兩個原則。，第一不可植黨營私，第二必須集思廣益，此外還有一點，最爲切要，就是人才的訓練與培植。姑以金融界實業界而論，在今日舉辦一個事業，倘使沒有人才做柱石，作後盾，是非常危險的。何以金融家企業家還不急起注意，來趕快訓練這批未來的幹部人才。</p>
<p>訓練的方法，除敎授專科知識以外，應注意實地練習，期得眞正的經騐學識。那麼改進各本業已往的缺點，自覺十分便捷了。同時需要設立專門的敎學機構，資送各家的辦事員助理員練習生入內研究，務求經騐學說，可以互相印證，這是當前的急務。設科不責多，而貴切用，課程不求過深，而求適合實際。人才是事業界之至寳，金融界與企業界，當不河漢此言。</p>
<h3>蘇浙皖棉製品同業聯合會　實業部指定發起人</h3>

<h3>商統會暫停簽發　紗布移動許可證</h3>

<h3>中央市場調查處長　岡野赴甬調調查</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　中央市塲爲適應戰時經濟體制，自將各業經紀人公會，改組爲各業集配出資組合，各業組合於上月已先後成立，該塲並設立評價委員會，管理各業組合之出貨公允價格，茲悉該塲以改組機構完全竣事，爲發揮其新機能及調整生活必需物資之價格而减低市民負擔爲原則，特派調查處處長岡野茂及屬員西猪之亟小笠原金之二人，定於今（九）日啓程赴寗波，鎮海，沈家門，黃巖，象山等地，實際調查當地之物資生產運輸報關等狀况，並與當地軍政局聯絡，務使物資暢流，减低成本，預定行程二週，市民對岡野此行，盼望甚殷。</p>
<h3>中央儲蓄會　擴大組織</h3>
<p>中央儲蓄會，自解除軍管理後，即經財政部呈經國民政府，指由中央儲備銀行撥基金接辦。指定唐壽民，葉扶霄等十五人爲監理委員，於四月一日起改組復業，開始新業務，聞內部組織，現已擴大爲八大科，即文書，會計，設計，儼券，營業，出納，人事，庶務等科，該會幷擬於短期內　設有獎儲劵儲蓄部門云。</p>
<h3>對於全國商業統制總會之觀感（三）</h3>
<p>— 兼言</p>
<p>（三）收買物資價格宜不偏不倚：關於物資收購亦須注意，否則不特不能增加，反足阻礙生產。對於收購物資，除手續必須簡捷，辦事人員必須廉潔而外，對於價格之　定，尤須注意。蓋如價　過高，足以促使製成品成本之增高，間接的提高一般物價之水準。反之，如價格過低，則足以阻礙收買工作之進行，造成原料之缺乏，減低工業之生產量；其結果亦爲物資缺乏，物價高漲。過去棉化收買工作，所以不能順利進行者，即由於公訂價格，過於低小所致。蓋農民如將其棉花按照公訂價　出售，則其所得貨價，尚不數轉購其所需之物品（如紗布）。因此，農民多將其自糧之棉花，用以自紡紗綫，自　土布。此種狀態，如任其　　存在，將造成農村方面之自　自足；農村方面所產之糧食與原料，將無由與都市工業品，相互交換。最後結果，必迫令都市陷於死境。故如何調整收買物資，促使收買工作順利進行，實爲該會首應注意之點。</p>
<p>（四）配給數量宜增：過去之物資統制，對於原料品之配給數量，似嫌過少，如化學品（燒碱，甘油等，從水配給，）生鐵，原棉等配給數量，均嫌過於短細，致「配給」二字，成爲有名無實。商統會成立後，宜力求避免此病。凡自華中收購及自華南華北交換而來之物資，務須儘量分配於華中之中日各廠商。此外，更須力求分配公允，蓋過去能獲得配給者，大多爲公會或組合中之少數份子，而眞正從事生產之廠商，大都無法獲得配給，祇得以高價自黑市中購買。此項畸形狀態，實足造成黑市。商統會成立以後，實不能容許此種狀態之繼續存在。</p>
<p>以上數點，僅憑不佞平日之觀感，探要而述。此外如辦事人員應如何廉潔，辦事手續應如何簡捷，在在均足以關係統制之成敗，想在商統會諸公洞鑒之中。（完）</p>
<h3>蠶絲建設特捐處設　蘇杭等五分處</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　財政部蘇浙皖區蠶絲建設特捐處，自成立以來，已有兩載於茲，前爲便利各地蠶絲特捐稅政推進起見，曾就各地統稅機關，代征特捐事宜，於本年一月一日起，蘇浙皖稅務總局，改組爲各省分別設置稅務局，及印花，烟酒稅局等六局，故該處已隨將蠶絲生產最繁盛之蘇州，無錫，嘉興，杭州，吳興等地區，設立分處五處，以期順利推進稅政。</p>
<h3>華中鑛業公司　積極推進業務</h3>
<p>中日合辦之華中鑛業公司，八日爲該公司創立五周年紀念，按該公司成立以還，開發資源不遺餘力、大東亞戰爭發生後，復又決定積極開發鐵鑛，螢石，錳等產業計劃，俾可供給擴大製鐵之需，而培養戰力，故每年採掘之銅，鐵，錳，螢石等，數量驚人。該公司並派地質資源特別調查隊分赴各地探採蘊藏無盡之地下咨資源，結果成績甚佳。（四月八日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>簡訉</h3>
<p>紅綠茶芯，新藥業頗見靑睞，因之去化　旺，由志記茶廠代進紅茶芯四十担，市價尚稱平定。</p>
<p>中華化學工業股份有限公司，最近召開創立會，前傳舉行董事會設不確，亦未選舉董事長云。</p>
<h3>譯論　經濟圈的單純化</h3>
<p>華中的經潸，先後因國府參戰與中日兩方　妥善措置，已成爲單純化的經濟。</p>
<p>通貨的性質，只求　暢通安定。在同一經濟圈內，有了幾種通貨流通，縱然各種通貨間　價値比率不變，可是通貨的本能，總不能作理想的發揮。事變以還，華中方面有各種不同的通貨同時存在，以致引起這貨混亂。　種混亂情形，在去年改革幣制時即已掃除，加以這次停止發行軍票新鈔，於是就實現單，通貨制，與華中經濟圈的一體化。</p>
<p>華中物資方面也將一體化，這要歸功於撤廢物資移動限制。目下是從過去　統制方式轉向新方式的過渡時期。</p>
<p>將來華中經濟，不是所謂自由主義經濟，而是統制經濟，始終在於矯正地域經濟主義和自自足經濟的傾向，而使全華中的經濟，在每一個地方　能暢通。</p>
<p>華中全域的通貨已經單一化。要是物資　能暢通那末因通貨與物資的　重關係，物價也目能單純　可是並不是說單純化以後，華中任何各地都一律　物價，當然還要酌量地點，以及他種關係，　運費以及其他種種，才能把物價的高低調和起來。</p>
<p>到了這種辦法一步一步地實現，才可算是物價水準，同時，每一個人方能安心從事經濟活動，而復興經濟，亦不難實現了。（四月六日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>五味之外</h3>
<p>— 祖文</p>
<p>在生活的經騐中，我們能辨別五種滋味：甜酸，苦，辣，鹹，湖南人嗜辣，四川人吃甜，北方人上館子少不了一碗酸辣湯，南方人嗜鹹菜糖年糕湯者大有人在，我鄕也有「臭南潯辣烏鎭」之諺，這雖是各地風俗人情如此，一般而言，五味之中，似乎只有》苦」字最不受人歡迎，黃連樹下彈琴，苦中作樂」，雖然有人這樣說過，但苦中作樂，顯然是出於勉强的。</p>
<p>五味之外，還有一味我覺得很値得提出來一說，那是什麼呢？一個淡字。　亂世，似乎「淡」字最用得着，能澹泊明志，不貪功求利，衣食住行，但求平淡。彌勒菩薩愒上的四句：「老拙穿衲襖，淡飯腹中飽，補破好遮寒，萬事隨緣了」可以做這「淡」註脚。大抵宇宙之間，不論爲人爲物，燦爛之極，必趨於平淡，平淡固自有其好處，但從燦爛歸到平淡，却是一種苦痛，因爲緬懷往事，常生感慨，過慣了奢華富麗生活，要再過粗衣淡飯的日子，實是難事。無怪古往今來，千百萬人中，只有極少數人的肯過淡泊自甘的生活了。</p>
<p>「身安茅屋穩，性定菜根香，世事靜方見，人情淡始長」，因爲偶然讀到這首詩，想起五味之外的這個「淡」字，吃膩了甜酸鹹辣的人們，且嗜這些　淡味如何？</p>
<h3>二月份徴文錄取第四名　怎樣讀書，讀什麼書？</h3>
<p>— 王承基</p>
<p>（一）讀書的重要性</p>
<p>爲了生存，我相信任何人都在渴求着知識。因此「讀書」便形成了求知唯一的良好利器。當然求知的利器很多，不一定就是「讀書」。然而至少可以說：它是求知最基本的方法。在這樣偉大的二十世紀裏，尤其在現在滬樣優勝劣敗競爭的洪流裏，並不是專靠經騐，專靠膂力，而沒有一點學識的人可以存在的！所以爲了生存，無論什麼人都需要讀書。</p>
<p>（二）讀書要能四到</p>
<p>讀「略讀」的書，最普通的方法就是看」。讀一精讀一的書，最普通的方法就是「讀」。然而不管用眼睛去「看」，或用嘴去「讀」總要專心一致的去看上讀。如果眼睛是在一行一行的看着書，或是嘴裏在哼哼的讀着書，而心裏在想着其他的事。這樣讀書的結果：眼睛是看酸了，嘴裏是讀苦了，光陰是逝去了，心中究竟是得着了什麼？所以無論怎樣讀書，除去了眼到口到外，還要心到，夏丐尊先生所謂讀書『三到』卽指此而言。然而用『三到』的方法讀書，並不能就算爲完美。譬如讀自然科學，或數理科學，固然『三到』的方法可以適用。然而你對於書中的認識是瞭解了。你對於書中的應用未必就純熟。所以你還得多多的用筆。對於書中的習題，你還得要多多的演算。這樣眼睛看着，嘴裏念着，心裏想着，筆底劃着，我相信任何的困難，都可立刻迎刃而解了。推廣言之，即就是讀文學書，社會書，甚致讀任何書。還是需要多用筆的。例如，讀英文生字。常然眼睛先要注視着生字，其次嘴裏念準了它的音節，然後心裏再記着它的組織。假使你再用筆應着嘴裏念的時候，隨時寫着。那麼這生字便可很迅速的記得了。例如讀文學，（任何書均可）遇到了精彩的地方，當然眼睛要多欣賞幾遍，嘴裏要多咏哦幾遍，心裏要多回憶幾遍。然而這些方法，僅能增加你暫時的美感，僅能幫助你暫時的記憶。所以爲了要得到永久性，只要遇到了精彩的地力，隨時用顏色筆作各種顯明的符號。或用個本子，隨時摘錄下來。這樣用筆僅僅劃　幾下，可以使得你的記憶更深刻化。所以我們無論什麼書，總要『四到』。那就是眼到，口到，心到，手到。</p>
<p>（三）讀什麼書</p>
<p>我們該相信；人類的智慧是進步的，書籍是與日俱增的。以人那有限的壽命，去讀那無窮盡的書籍，確是件難事，因此我們處於這漫漫的，書海』內，首先的難題：便是『讀什麼書』。當然，任何書都有他存在的價値。然而對於　自己的需要，未必全部適官。因爲我根本就有我自己的志願。我那能，同時，我那有時間去讀與我志願相違的書。然而只要有時間。正當的書，都可有規律的去選讀。</p>
<p>整個業餘的時間，都用着讀自己要讀的書。不免要感到單調枯澀。這樣結果甚致可以减步讀書的興趣。所以在我們團爲精神已在相當疲倦之時。立刻有節制的，有規律的，換讀一些有助於個人進修以及文化修養的書，作爲調劑精神的工具。讀了這類的書，一方面可以調劑你精神過度的緊張，一方面可以作爲你讀書的工具，同時還可以使你認議歷史上的偉人一生奮鬥的情形，增加了你莫大的經騐。</p>
<p>總之，無論讀什麼書，我們始終否認『學究式』的泛讓。但是爲了要增加讀書的效果，有些工具是必不可少的！如參考書，有助於個人進修以及文化修養的書等。所以我們對於讀什麼書的結論便是：『我們要從自己听讀的書中培植起一種特長，我們不需要從自己所讀的書中變成了一個平凡雜貨攤』！（編者按，本文全篇約五千餘字，爲節省篇幅，祇能摘錄數節希作者原諒爲幸）</p>
<h3>賣布攤</h3>
<p>— 天明作</p>
<h3>審美力</h3>
<p>— 寄塵</p>
<p>惟有「美」能够啟發我們的心靈，使我們培養成優良的品格，高超的情操，淸潔的嗜好，靈敏的感覺，惟有「審美」能够驅除煩惱，使我們快樂，和善，安心於工作。</p>
<p>一個人決不會脫離了「美」，終日沉浸在粗暴煩惱的境域裏，而能成就一件偉大的工作。當一件「美」的東西，置放在許多破敗的物品堆中時，我們立刻就會意識到那一件是最「美」的，因爲「美」能使我們的心靈裏，發出一種神秘的力量來，集中我們的注意力。因此，我們可以明白，歷史上有許多偉大工作的成就，都是由於「美」的影響。</p>
<p>馬其頓說：「「愛「美」有陶冶溫良品格的力量。最不幸的事情，就是把一個孩子，置在愛錢如命的環境中；以致養成他將來做人的目的，不以人格爲重，而惟金錢是務」。</p>
<p>這句話好像是凖對着現時現地而說的。雖然，我們並不是孩子，但我們年紀尚輕，努力養成愛「美」的心理，審「美」的心理，審「美」的力量吧！並且，也不要忽略了培植我們的孩子去愛「美」與審「美」。</p>
<h3>談以身作則</h3>
<p>— 徐志明</p>
<p>「以身作則」，別忽視這是一句口頭禪，每多人不能遵行而致上下不能協調，家庭趨於衰落，社會陷於混亂。身處領導地位者，尤其刻刻不能忘却它。例如：你是一位上司，倘能「以身作則」，勤奮在先，實事求是，公正不阿，則下屬必能競相效力，刻苦自勵，不苟不怠，這樣事業怎不蒸蒸日上　反之你自身苟且舞弊，濫施職權，自私執拗，則下屬必不能努力本位工作，狡猾者敷衍塞責，忠厚者抱怨咒詛，甚致「上有好者，下必有甚焉者矣。」彼此交相效尤，弊害無窮。這樣，工作怎會進步？事業無從發展？</p>
<p>我認爲：——</p>
<p>家長能以身作則，則子女必賢，家庭必能健全。老闆能以身作則，則夥友必忠，業務必趨發達。</p>
<p>執政者能以身作則，則政令必治，社會必臻安寗。</p>
<p>如果各階各層能以身作則，則國家未有不富强者。希望人人能够遵行。</p>
<h3>根</h3>
<p>— 辛波</p>
<p>他們坐了好一會，天上的雲有些厚起來了，阿五就先立起來，說：恐怕天要下雨，不如早些走。他付了茶資。</p>
<p>大根面孔紅紅地看着阿五付，因爲他並沒有準備，袋裏一個小錢也沒有，只好說：「阿五哥，很對你不起。」</p>
<p>阿五說：「這算什麼。」說着，還是他在前，領着大根從後面的門裏出來，到了略有些佈置的後園裏，然後走出黃石堆成的圍牆，再夾在大隊的遊人裏向北走。</p>
<p>一陣吒旺旺的鑼聲從北面迎來，接着就是一大隊燒肉香的人，他們都是年輕力壯的小夥子，都穿了白布短衫，束着婦女的百裥綢裙，兩角掖了起來，一手執着槌，一手掛着鑼，走幾步，打幾下，鑼掛在幾十隻鋼鈎上，鋼鈎的上端都掛着右肘下面的皮上，如異是幾十斤的大鑼，皮便被拉得垂下來，有數寸長。據說這是許的願，「報娘恩」。</p>
<p>「我也很想去燒一次肉香」，阿五說，「他媽的，總走不開。明年我一定不會錯過了」。</p>
<p>大根笑笑，沒有接下去說。</p>
<p>從直上山頂磴道上，又走下了幾隊拜香的人，他們都穿了長衫，戴了凉帽，手執香橙，口裏唱着，一步一步地拜下來。那一種虔誠的能度，眞可以驚天地而泣鬼神。他們都是鄉下人，老幼都有。</p>
<p>「我說拜香倒很有意思」，大根隨便說。</p>
<p>「什麼意思，一步一拜，不過磕頭虫罷了，倒不如手臂上一個洞一個洞，掛起鑼來，殺殺剝剝地暢快一下！」（二十七）</p>

<h3>Official and Commercial Separation</h3>
<p>The National Government issued an order on the 7th (see page 4 of yesterday's newspaper), the main points of which are: (1) It has been found that large-scale speculation and hoarding of important materials has occurred in Shanghai recently. (2) Chen Zhishuo, Yuan Yu-zhi, Zhao Shuyong, and Chen Yunwen are appointed to investigate thoroughly and impartially. (3) If the main officers of financial institutions engage in speculative transactions, those that are government-run will be temporarily suspended and immediately reorganized; those that are privately run will be closed. (4) Those who engage in speculative transactions, manipulate market prices, and disrupt the market will be reported to the National Defense Conference for special punishment after verification, regardless of who they are, and all materials seized will be confiscated.</p>
<p>We will further analyze this order. The first point is the motivation for the thorough investigation; the second point is the personnel in charge of the thorough investigation; the third point is the target of the thorough investigation; and the fourth point is the punishment measures. Everything has been clearly stated. We believe that the promulgation of this order is a clear indication of the National Government's efforts to rectify politics and stabilize people's livelihoods. Standing from the people's standpoint, we would like to offer some humble opinions in addition to our gratitude:</p>
<p>First, the government has stated that "it has been found that large-scale speculation and hoarding of important materials has occurred in Shanghai recently." Then, the government must have obtained sufficient information beforehand, but it did not directly name the perpetrators before obtaining sufficient evidence. Therefore, it is only a matter of time before such large-scale hoarding cases are announced to the public after a thorough and impartial investigation. During this thorough investigation process, we hope that all citizens of Shanghai must abide by national laws and further assist the government in implementing them.</p>
<p>Second, financial institutions hold the funds and their operations are most critical. The government's special focus on financial institutions as the target of thorough investigation is intentional. At present, there are many financial institutions in Shanghai. How to conduct spot checks or thorough investigations on a case-by-case basis is up to the investigators. What we can add is that, for the chairman, directors, or major shareholders of commercial banks or enterprises who are current government officials, or who participate under assumed names, in order to avoid suspicion under the law strictly prohibiting public officials from concurrently engaging in commerce, they should be ordered to resign immediately to avoid suspicion. The separation of official and commercial sectors must be strictly defined in order to prevent future malpractices.</p>
<p>Third, Shanghai has a wide area and a large amount of hoarding. The government's thorough investigation alone may not have sufficient reach, and its manpower may be insufficient. In order to thoroughly clarify the situation, it is even more active and effective to rely on reports from people in society. We hope that impartial people with good reputations in the community will voluntarily organize institutions to specifically accept reports of hoarding cases and hand them over to the government for handling after thorough investigation. This work does not conflict with the government's thorough investigation. Instead, it assists the government and complements it. It is expected to be agreed upon by the government and desired by the people in society. Secondly, the public concession area is the main base for large and powerful hoarders. Before the concession is returned, we hope that the Allied authorities will participate in assisting the implementation of this important work. At the same time, if it is found that Japanese personnel are also hoarding, we hope that the Allied authorities will take similar measures to crack down on it.</p>
<p>Fourth, the responsibility of "thorough and impartial investigation" is so important that we can say that the key to the government's success in establishing credibility and starting anew with the people lies in these four words. Only "impartiality" can achieve the true effect of thorough investigation. After believing that the government has the determination, it will naturally be particularly cautious in evaluating and selecting candidates. The government places deep trust in them, and our people's expectations are even more eager. We also have something we must say: among the investigators, some are senior officials in charge of financial undertakings and industrial and commercial industries, and some are senior officials in charge of Shanghai's municipal administration. They may be familiar with the main officers in the financial sector. Under this kind of environment, they must have the spirit of breaking through affection and putting public interests first, so as to live up to the expectations of the public and fulfill their responsibilities.</p>
<p>In addition, the targets of thorough investigation should not be limited to financial institutions. We have suggested in the editorial on the 6th of this month that the goods hoarded in warehouses and the warehouse clients of insurance companies should also be targets of thorough investigation. As for the results of the thorough investigation, there are strict regulations in the government order, so we will not repeat them for the time being.</p>
<p>Finally, we solemnly declare that the price issue is the most serious livelihood issue at present; cracking down on hoarding and profiteering is the most effective short-term solution to suppressing prices. Now that the government has shown its determination to crack down on hoarding, all of us must fully support the government's consistent implementation of this proposition!</p>
<h3>Special Envoy to Manchukuo, Mr. Zhou Fohai, Arrives in Manchukuo Yesterday to Inspect Construction and Discuss Cooperation in the War</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Propaganda Department jointly announced the following at 1:00 p.m. on April 8th: After the National Government entered the war, in order to further enhance the friendly relations between China and Manchukuo, and to smooth the economic relations between China and Manchukuo, Zhou Fohai, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, was specially appointed as a special envoy to Manchukuo to inspect various important industrial constructions and other facilities in Manchukuo, and to have frank discussions with the Manchukuo authorities on the issue of cooperating to complete the war. Special Envoy Zhou departed for Manchukuo at 9:00 a.m. today, accompanied by Yang Xinghua, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, Ma Jiliang, Director of the Central Reserve Bank, Shen Juchen, Deputy Director of the Central Reserve Bank, and Okada Shoji, Economic Advisor to the National Government.</p>
<p>Xinjing, 8th (Central News Agency) The Manchukuo Information Department issued the following statement at noon on the 8th regarding the visit of the Chinese Special Envoy Zhou Fohai: Mr. Zhou Fohai, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance of the Republic of China, is visiting Manchukuo to express the Republic of China's determination to fight against Britain and the United States to our government and people, and to discuss mutual cooperation strategies with our government leaders to complete the Greater East Asia War, and to inspect the development status of our country. He arrived in Manchukuo today.</p>
<p>Xinjing, 8th (Central News Agency) According to observations from political figures here, Zhou Fohai, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Minister of Finance, and President of the Central Reserve Bank of the National Government, is visiting Manchukuo as a special envoy this time, following the visit of Prime Minister Tojo, to hold discussions with the Manchukuo government authorities and inspect the progress of Manchukuo's construction. The relationship between the two countries will therefore become closer. This is of great significance for the two countries to reaffirm their unwavering determination and strengthen their political and economic ties in the current decisive stage. Since the joint declaration issued by China, Japan, and Manchukuo, the relationship between China and Manchukuo has gradually increased. As Chairman Wang previously visited Manchukuo and gained a deep understanding of the construction and advancement of Manchukuo, the close cooperation between the two countries has developed rapidly. Furthermore, due to the reciprocal visit of Manchukuo's Prime Minister Zhang, the leaders of the two governments have a deep understanding of each other. At this time when the two countries are closely cooperating and working together to complete the Greater East Asia War, the National Government has specially sent Zhou Fohai, who holds several important positions, to visit Manchukuo, hold discussions with the Manchukuo government leaders, and inspect the progress of Manchukuo's construction over the past ten years. This move will make great contributions to the construction of the New China and the economic cooperation and material exchange between China and Manchukuo, and is indeed worthy of anticipation.</p>
<p>Ambassador of Manchukuo Speaks</p>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) Mr. Lu Ronghuan, Ambassador of Manchukuo to China, issued the following statement regarding the visit of Special Envoy Zhou:</p>
<p>Special Envoy Zhou's visit to Manchukuo is the first visit after the National Government entered the war. The national relations between China and Manchukuo will therefore become even more harmonious. Since the joint declaration issued by China, Japan, and Manchukuo, our two countries have been busy with political affairs every day, visiting our country. The good neighborly friendship, joint anti-communism, and economic cooperation relations advocated by the three countries' joint declaration have been strengthened. Since the founding of our country, we have been working hard for ten years. The first phase of construction has been completed, and we have now entered the second phase of construction. After the launch of the Greater East Asia War for the revival of Asia, our country issued a basic national policy at the end of last year, generally seeking to unite the total strength of the country in the political, economic, and livelihood sectors, and contributing to the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. All major national policies are planned and considered in a unified manner, and the government and people are working hard under this great plan. Special Envoy Zhou's visit to Manchukuo is warmly welcomed by the government and people of our country. Moreover, in the current stage of the Greater East Asia War, the hub of Manchukuo and China will be strengthened as a result, and the cooperation between the two countries with Japan will be further strengthened. After Special Envoy Zhou has frank discussions with our country's relevant authorities, the economic interoperability between the two countries and the increase in wartime productivity are undoubtedly inevitable. In particular, Special Envoy Zhou's inspection of our country's various facilities and the spirit of hard work of our people will surely gain many good references for the construction of a great new China. It will not only make great contributions to the national relations between China and Manchukuo, but also make profound contributions to the future of our Greater East Asia War. This is what we have high expectations and hopes for Special Envoy Zhou and his entourage. Finally, I wish Special Envoy Zhou and all members of his entourage a smooth journey and good health.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) Mr. Chen Gongbo, Special Envoy of China, arrived in Tokyo on the 7th and, accompanied by four members of his entourage, visited the Japanese Emperor at the Imperial Palace on the 8th and had lunch together. He received all kinds of preferential treatment. On the same day, Special Envoy Chen, accompanied by Xu Liang, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of China to Japan, departed from the Imperial Hotel at 11:40 a.m. in a car specially reserved by the Japanese Ministry of Greater East Asia, and entered the Imperial Palace from the main gate of the Nijubashi Bridge. The group was led by Mizuno, an official of the Ministry of Ceremonies, to the Phoenix Room. His Majesty the Emperor arrived in person at noon. After being introduced by Ambassador Xu Liang, Special Envoy Chen first met with the Emperor, shook hands with the Emperor, and then Special Envoy Chen delivered a greeting upon his arrival in Japan and expressed his respect. His Majesty the Emperor expressed his condolences to Special Envoy Chen and his entourage, translated by Mr. Ikeimizu. At 12:30 p.m., His Majesty the Emperor hosted a banquet for Special Envoy Chen and his entourage at the Homei-den Hall. Prince Higashikuninomiya also attended. Prime Minister Tojo, Foreign Minister Tani, Aoki, Minister of Greater East Asia, Matsudaira, Minister of the Imperial Household, Hyakutake, Chief Aide-de-Camp, and Hasunuma, Military Aide-de-Camp, were also in attendance.

<h3>Celebrating the 60th Birthday Together, Chairman's Birthday is Held</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) Mr. Chu Minyi, Member of the National Government and Minister of Foreign Affairs, advocated celebrating the 60th birthday together, aiming to reform vulgar customs and improve society. On July 28th last year, it was held in the capital, and citizens participated enthusiastically. This year is the period of the Guiwei joint celebration, and Mr. Chu has estimated that it will be held at 3:00 p.m. on May 4th, and it is reported that this year's joint celebration will be even more prosperous. Because Chairman Wang is also the same year as Guiwei, the guests and officials of the National Government originally intended to celebrate his birthday. However, Chairman Wang, believing that celebrating the birthday of one person would burden the public and was not in line with the ancient people's spirit of sharing joy with the people, issued a handwritten instruction to show his approval of the intention of celebrating the 60th birthday together. Minister Chu, in order to embody Chairman Wang's heart of sharing joy with the people, and to celebrate the auspiciousness of the "Tai Qi San Yang", specially named the year of Guiwei permanently as "Tai Shou Year". Furthermore, it is reported that the day of this year's joint celebration was originally not May 4th according to the usual calculation. However, since Chairman Wang's birthday is May 4th in the Gregorian calendar, if it is held according to the original practice, Chairman Wang's birthday must be postponed. The birthday of the head of state is related to national system and international etiquette, and it is not appropriate to postpone the date. Therefore, after Mr. Chu made some changes (the month and day were advanced, but the year and time remained the same), it was decided that May 4th would be the date of this year's joint celebration, both to show respect for the head of state and to celebrate the joy of celebrating the 60th birthday together. It is also stipulated as a permanent rule that in the future, whenever Guiwei Miao Shi occurs, the day of celebrating the 60th birthday together shall be set on May 4th to commemorate and follow it for generations.</p>

<h3>Proclamation of the National Government Declaring War on Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th of the year before last, the National Government, in accordance with the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, declared its determination to share weal and woe with the allied nation Japan. Since then, it has embarked on the New National Movement, engaged in safeguarding security, improving people's livelihoods, and striving to increase national strength to assist in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, Britain, the United States, and other countries continue to use their century-old policy of dividing East Asia, and have even intensified it, actually colluding with the Chongqing elements to participate in the so-called Anglo-American front, sending troops to Burma and India, and using East Asians to kill East Asians. Recently, because their violence has been gradually defeated by the armed forces of the allied nation Japan, and the bases for invading East Asia have also been lost, they have become even more cunning. Moreover, they are jealous of the peaceful development of the areas ruled by the National Government, instigating the Chongqing elements to constantly harass us, in order to obstruct the progress of various constructions, and even using their own aircraft, using Chongqing as a base, to repeatedly bomb Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, harming civilians. It is shameful that the Chongqing elements are willing to be driven by Britain and the United States and serve as traitors to East Asia; and it is even more important for the people of East Asia to share the same hatred of Britain and the United States, who have been scheming for East Asia and doing everything possible to sow discord in order to achieve their ultimate desire to annex it. The National Government hereby declares that, from today onwards, it is in a state of war with Britain and the United States, and will do its best to cooperate with the allied nation Japan to sweep away the brutality of Britain and the United States, in order to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. The two countries of Manchukuo and Thailand have long maintained friendly relations and have the same heart for East Asia's co-prosperity. In the future, we should strive for more cooperation in order to jointly build a new East Asian order based on morality. The allied nations of Germany and Italy have been fighting against the forces of Britain and the United States in the West for many years and have repeatedly won glorious victories. Our country is now participating in the Greater East Asia War and should echo each other in order to contribute to a just new order for the entire world. All our citizens should know that this is the only opportunity to realize Father of the Nation's Pan-Asianism. The revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the attainment of just peace for the entire world all depend on this. Let us be united and work together from beginning to end to thoroughly fulfill the great mission of this great era!</p>

<h3>War Results of the Japanese Army in Hubei Province</h3>
<p>Hankou, 8th (Central News Agency) After a Japanese army unit learned that the Chongqing army's 38th Division and the 53rd Provisional Division were attempting to move near Jingmen, it launched an attack on the 17th of last month, and successively defeated the Chongqing army and captured its important strongholds, Zhujiaji Yantang and Lixi, and achieved great results. In this battle, the Chongqing army left behind 334 corpses, 17 people were captured, and 3 light machine guns, 38 rifles, and a lot of other ammunition were seized. Another Japanese army unit in Yuezhou also responded to this, and launched an attack on the Chongqing army near Yuezhou on the 27th of this month, and is still continuing to clear the area. As of the other day, 36 corpses of the Chongqing army have been found and 6 people have been captured.</p>

<h3>Bilhorod and Kharkov East, Germany and the Soviet Union Concentrated Large Armies, Donets Central Germany Launched an Offensive</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) The German High Command announced on the 7th regarding the Eastern Front, (1) The Soviet army launched a local offensive under the cover of a strong artillery force, but was repelled by Germany, (2) The German army launched an offensive in the central Donets area, repelled the stubborn resistance of the Soviet army, and quickly reached its destination. A certain commando of the Spanish Blue Division destroyed 14 Soviet strongholds in the northern part of the Eastern Front.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency) News from Berlin last night said that the German army in the Izium area southeast of Kharkov had made progress again and had driven out the remnants of the Soviet army in the bends of the Donets. According to German military experts, the area east of Bilhorod and Kharkov is the most important area on the entire Eastern Front, because Germany and the Soviet Union have concentrated large armies in this area. A Reuters reporter in Moscow reported last night that a large number of German aircraft were centered behind the Kharkov Izium Taganrog front, and it was reported that the German army continued to move large numbers of troops from the rear, which shows that the German army may also expect to have a large-scale battle in this area. The official German news agency said last night that weak Soviet army units along the upper reaches of the Donets River had attempted to reach the west bank of the river, but were repelled by German mortars and automatic weapons. The Soviet army south of Izium attempted to recapture an important high ground, but failed, and two Soviet battalions were wiped out, with 300 people captured and 600 people killed in battle. In the central sector south of Orel, a Soviet commando team was cut off and surrounded by the German army. It is said that the Soviet army was wiped out in hand-to-hand combat. South of Lake Ilmen and south of Staraya, the Spanish Youth Division entered the Soviet army's position, carried out large-scale destruction, and captured many prisoners. The German army in the area east of the Kuban bridgehead repelled an attack assisted by an artillery force. The Romanian army immediately counterattacked and repelled several Soviet army units that had broken into the German-Romanian joint front. Other attacking Soviet troops were also defeated before the main axis of the Axis powers. The weather on the northern and central fronts was bad, and the German air force was unable to conduct large-scale activities, but the German battle squadron participated in the battles of the Kuban bridgehead and the Donets front on Tuesday.</p>
<h3>British and American Forces in Tunisia Launch Fierce Attacks on the German Army</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) According to news received here last night, after the British and American forces in Tunisia launched an attack on Tuesday, Rommel's Afrika Korps, in addition to holding its position north of Gabes, launched a fierce counterattack. According to news from the anti-Axis headquarters, the troops under General Mongomery launched an attack early on Tuesday morning, and the troops of the US Second Army also attacked from the west. According to German new reports, the anti-Axis forces hoped to make a pincer movement, attacking simultaneously from the Gafsa area in the south of Auldreville El Hamma and from the area around Macknassy in the northwest. In the past few days, General Mongomery has concentrated a total of troops near Auldreville, and the American and French rebel armies have continuously attacked the Axis positions, their purpose being obviously to link up with the American army under General Patton and the British Eighth Army, but this move has completely failed, and the anti-Axis forces have failed to implement their planned pincer movement. The American and French rebel armies suffered heavy losses in manpower and material resources when attacking the hills of Macknassy and attacking from Jebel Kanz towards Jebel Beda, and failed to break through the Axis positions that blocked the two highways from Gafsa to Gabes and to Sfax. At the same time, the British Eighth Army launched a large-scale attack between Auldreville and the coast, hoping to break through the German-Italian positions. The battle lasted all day, and the British army suffered heavy losses in manpower and material resources, because the British army was forced to advance through the mine-filled area of San Wadi Agarit. The British army's reconnaissance activities, which hoped to survey the terrain and facilitate combat, also failed because of the Axis army's careful vigilance. As a result, the British army was trapped by fierce artillery fire, and at the same time, powerful German dive bombers and bomber squadrons also effectively assisted the ground combat, specializing in attacking enemy artillery positions and tanks behind the front lines. The Axis army bravely held its prepared positions, and when the anti-Axis forces attacked again with new troops, the Axis army's armored units launched a counterattack. As of yesterday, the area was still in fierce fighting.</p>
<h3>U.S. Representative to the Soviet Union: List Reportedly Finalized</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to a London dispatch, the London Daily Express's correspondent in Washington, after having made inquiries with qualified sources at the U.S. State Department, has learned that the list of representatives likely to go to Moscow to personally meet with Stalin includes Archbishop Spellman of New York, Vice President Wallace, Presidential Advisor Hopkins, and Under Secretary of State Welles. The reporter pointed out that talk of a meeting between Roosevelt and Stalin is still premature. However, Washington seems determined to have the Soviet Union promptly present its demands. Meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary Eden continues to refuse to disclose whether his negotiations in Washington have yielded any concrete results. However, important figures in the United States feel that unless the Soviet Union receives greater military assistance in the near future, it may not enter into binding agreements with its Western allies.</p>
<h3>Bolivia Declares War, Orders Military Mobilization</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from La Paz, Bolivia's declaration of war against the Axis powers was signed by the Bolivian president yesterday and, after being approved by the congress, was immediately announced. A military mobilization order was also issued simultaneously, but it is not entirely clear whether it is a general or partial mobilization. Bolivian newspapers are focusing on the demands of the country's seamen. Political figures speculate that the Bolivian president will raise this issue during his official visit to the United States on September 1.</p>
<h3>Wartime Economy and Sino-Japanese Cooperation (1) – Interview with Minister of Industry Mei by Japanese Reporters</h3>
<p>Following the National Government's entry into the war on January 9, it is moving towards establishing a decisive battle system. At the same time, it is conducting comprehensive cooperation with Japan in the political, military, and economic spheres. The Japanese side has already returned the leased territories under exclusive administration in China, abolished extraterritorial rights, first returned the Beijing Legation Quarter, and transferred the rights to purchase and allocate controlled goods. This integration of Sino-Japanese relations transcends previous diplomatic relations and establishes a "shared destiny." This cooperative system, formed through Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, is now being realized concretely and permanently. This Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, starting with the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association, is being completely reorganized in accordance with the Chinese side's desire for "division of labor and cooperation." The development of military resources, the creation and revival of heavy and light industries, and the restoration of Greater East Asia trade relations are gradually taking concrete form. The economic revival of peaceful areas has also aroused the longing of non-peaceful areas, and a glimmer of hope has emerged for the realization of comprehensive peace through economic power. A reporter recently had the opportunity to meet with Minister of Industry Mei for a special interview, and learned about the progress of the National Government's decisive battle economy, the new development of Sino-Japanese cooperation, and the prospect of comprehensive economic peace. The following is the Q&amp;A with Minister Mei:</p>
<p>Our newspaper asks: First, we would like to know the sequence for establishing a decisive battle economy. Recently, it seems that reorganization has begun with the commercial sector. Starting from this aspect, what sequence should be followed to establish a decisive battle economy? Please provide a general explanation.</p>
<p>Minister Mei replies: This can be divided into two parts. The biggest goals of establishing a wartime economic system this time are, first, to increase production, and second, to supply the front lines with military supplies. These are the biggest goals this time. In order to increase production, the first step now is to ease controls. For example, on the one hand, we are reducing the scope of restrictions on people moving out of the Shanghai area, so that the exchange of goods between Shanghai and the inland can proceed smoothly. On the other hand, we are also improving economic institutions. The new commercial institutions can now be divided into three levels. The first is the trade association, the second is the federation of trade associations of various industries, which is the second level of organization, and the third is the highest National Commercial Control Association.</p>
<p>The trade association is the lowest-level cell, the basic organization, organized by county and city. Next, the trade associations of various industries in each county and city are concentrated. For example, the trade associations of the tobacco industry across the country are concentrated to form the federation of tobacco trade associations. The types of federations can be organized separately according to different types of industries such as coal, tobacco, and cotton yarn.</p>
<p>Question: About how many of these kinds of federations are there?</p>
<p>Answer: There are about twenty different kinds. The National Commercial Control Association integrates these federations as members.</p>
<p>Question: Then it seems that Japanese trading companies do not join the Commercial Control Association. But can Japanese trading companies join the federations and trade associations?</p>
<p>Answer: Japanese trading companies can also participate in the National Commercial Control Association. Trading companies on both the Chinese and Japanese sides can join and become members. For example, a federation formed solely by the Japanese side can also become a member of the Control Association. It can be divided into three levels. The lowest level trade association, is based on the principle of distinguishing between Japanese and Chinese trade associations. According to the different types of industries, separate Japanese groups and Chinese associations are established. When forming the middle-level federation, each organizes its own federation for each industry. Then, both sides merge to form the top-level control association. Japanese and Chinese must absolutely participate fully. If the Japanese do not participate, the national control cannot be established.</p>
<p>Question: Now that the trade association has been reorganized and given full power, the regulations restricting the movement of goods will be abolished, right?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, it will be abolished on the day the reorganization is completed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Occupy India-Burma Border Area: Northern Region of Akyab, British Main Force on Maungdaw River Defeated</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 8th: (1) Imperial Army units have occupied the northern region of Akyab near the India-Burma border. Since late December of last year, they have repulsed the offensive of an Anglo-Indian division. Since the beginning of March, they have shifted to the offensive, destroying the main force of the enemy on the Maungdaw River in a large encirclement battle. They are currently mopping up the remaining enemy forces. (2) The Supreme Commander of the Army in Burma is Lieutenant General Masazo Kawabe.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to reports from various units of the Japanese army on the India-Burma border, a magnificent annihilation battle against the enemy's main force has been underway on the banks of the Maungdaw River since the beginning of March. After the Japanese army completed two major encirclement annihilation battles near Kaladan and Kyauktaw, their morale increased. They crossed the Maungdaw River at midnight on the 24th and occupied Ataiddaung, at the foot of the Maungdaw Mountains on the night of the 26th. Currently, the vanguard of the Japanese army has attacked the Maungdaw mountain range and, after eliminating the enemy's stubborn resistance from both land and air, is advancing fiercely into the mountains northwest of Ataiddaung.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 8th (Central News Agency) – The Indian anti-Axis expeditionary force repeatedly stated at the Casablanca Conference of the British and Americans that they wanted to retake Burma and strategically mobilize troops on the eastern border of India. However, no matter how much propaganda they did, there was still no progress in the battle situation. It was not until the 7th that they announced that the anti-Axis forces had retreated to new positions after being severely beaten by the Japanese army, thus admitting the fact of their failure. According to a United Press dispatch from Calcutta, the British military headquarters telegraphed that the battle situation in the Arakan region had been extremely calm in the past December, but until the 7th of this month, because the Japanese army's jungle troops secretly moved north through narrow hilly areas, the anti-Axis forces on the Maungdaw Peninsula were forced to retreat twelve kilometers. According to a United Press dispatch from New Delhi, the anti-Axis military headquarters' communique on the 7th also stated that the Japanese army in the Arakan region had begun to move a few days ago, intending to break through the northern part of the anti-Axis forces' position on the Maungdaw Peninsula and cross the Maungdaw River south of Gazak, threatening the anti-Axis forces' supply base in the narrow area between the northern hills of Donbaik and the coast. Therefore, the anti-Axis forces had to prepare new positions again. In addition, according to an Associated Press dispatch from New Delhi, the anti-Axis forces on the Maungdaw Peninsula had withdrawn to new positions because the Japanese army crossed the Maungdaw River south of Gazak and invaded the anti-Axis forces' position.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – The former Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army in Burma, Lieutenant General Shojiro Iida, made great contributions during his tenure in blocking the supply route to Chongqing and establishing the foundation of Burma. Recently, he has been transferred to an important position. His successor is Lieutenant General Masazo Kawabe, former Chief of Staff of the Japanese China Expeditionary Army. According to reports, the new Supreme Commander Kawabe served as a unit commander immediately after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, fighting in the North China area and achieving great merit. He later served as the Chief of the Education General Directorate Headquarters. After being transferred to the Chief of Staff of the China Expeditionary Army in August of last year, he made great contributions to defeating the Chongqing forces and completing the Greater East Asia War. Now he has been transferred to Burma to face the front line where the enemy is determined to counterattack. With the recent announcement of the great victory of annihilating the Anglo-Indian army's counterattack, his prestige is officially revealed. It is self-evident how great the threat that the general's prestige brings to the Anglo-Indian army and the Chongqing forces. Therefore, there are high expectations from all sides.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Attack Chittagong Port</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from New Delhi, the British Indian Expeditionary Force Headquarters announced that Japanese air units resumed bombing British military positions in Chittagong Port on the 5th.</p>
<h3>New German Submarine Victories</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – Yesterday's communique from the German High Command stated that German submarines recently sank a total of fourteen anti-Axis ships, totaling 102,000 tons, including the large refrigerated ship "Melbourne Star" (12,806 tons). The ship, carrying goods from the United States to Australia, was sunk in the central Atlantic. Its average speed was nineteen nautical miles per hour. In addition, three oil tankers, totaling 41,000 tons, were also among those sunk. Since the beginning of the war, the number of anti-Axis oil tankers sunk has reached 770, totaling 5.6 million tons. Before the war, Britain and the United States had a total of 6.1 million tons of oil tankers. The total tonnage of oil tankers worldwide in the autumn of 1939 was 11.4 million tons, of which half has now sunk to the bottom of the sea.</p>
<h3>Hitler Receives Commander-in-Chief of the Navy</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – German President Hitler received Grand Admiral Dönitz, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy and Commander of the Submarine Fleet, on the 7th. He praised the recent intense activity of the German submarine fleet and the Grand Admiral's outstanding operational command. He will award the Grand Admiral the Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross.</p>
<h3>New Tactics of German Submarines Cause Great Distress to Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Berlin by Mamoru Shouyama, 27th) – German submarine warfare tactics have recently adopted the group warfare method of multiple submarines. In the published communiques, the new term "submarine group" has appeared. The enemy is also making it the object of various discussions. For example, according to an Associated Press dispatch from London, when the newly formed German submarine fleet used to attack North Atlantic convoys, one group attacked the enemy, while another group waited beyond the horizon, preparing to take turns attacking. This group attack tactic is a clever strategy adopted by Germany due to a shortage of crew members and trained submarine commanders. As a result, an excellent submarine commander can command a large group of a dozen submarines.</p>
<p>In the recent North Atlantic submarine warfare, thirty-three ships in the convoy from the United States to the British mainland, 240,040 tons, were sunk in five days. This was probably also the result of group attacks. The German naval authorities seem to be full of confidence, saying: "New tactics have been obtained from past experience."</p>
<p>British and American estimates of the total number of German submarines currently owned, with about one-third actually active on the front lines, and the remaining two-thirds staying at the base for repair or sailing at sea. In the previous war, the maximum number of German submarines was only 200. Even according to British and American estimates, with two-thirds remaining at the base, there are still quite a few German submarines chasing enemy ships from the Arctic Ocean to the South Atlantic. Although the British Air Force repeatedly bombed German submarine bases on the French coast or the locations of German shipyards, the number of German submarines is still increasing day by day, being mass-produced at an average rate of one every one and a half days. Because it is necessary to sail far to the Caribbean Sea, the South American sea, or the southern waters of the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, the shape of the submarines is also made large and capable of long-distance sailing, and the propulsion power has also increased to 200 nautical miles. When sailing on the surface of the water, it is twice as fast as ordinary convoys. Therefore, the enemy is extremely afraid of this.</p>
<p>Helplessness in Submarine Countermeasures</p>
<p>What are the countermeasures of Britain and the United States against this threat to the maritime supply line? There has been no new discovery of active methods of attacking submarines, driving away submarines, or effective and appropriate new weapons. This is also often frankly admitted in British and American newspapers. Therefore, the people have successively criticized, whipped, and warned their own governments, and the public sentiment is turbulent, becoming one of the major domestic problems. The only method is to fully equip the convoys with sonar, torpedoes, and cannons as active attack weapons, and to build special destroyers to strengthen the aircraft used to search and attack submarines, but none of these methods has absolute confidence. Therefore, most of the efforts in submarine warfare are concentrated on the passive method of building new ships to make up for the losses. The "Submarine Defense Conference" held in Washington last time, and the weekly "Submarine Countermeasures Conference" held in London, which has been held more than twenty times, only looked at each other in dismay, at a loss.</p>
<p>What type of new ship should be built to supplement the sunken merchant ships? This is what they feel most headache about. Recently, a reporter from the British Daily Mail published a test ride record of a newly built submarine-resistant cargo ship. The ship has a special device to know the location of enemy submarines, is equipped with several cannons, has also been strengthened in armament, and has high speed and turning performance. It is said that mass production of this type of ship is now beginning.</p>
<p>The American Waterhouse and the shipbuilders from Cape Cod jointly proposed "radio-controlled submarine cargo ships." These are cigar-shaped hulls, submerged in water, and operated by destroyers using radio control. Their features are simple structure, low construction price, and very little use of steel. They do not require crew members to operate. It is said that one has been test-built and has sailed from Florida to Washington without crew members. A British shipbuilding technician named Pons pointed out that the convoy system only serves as a target for German group attacks, and advocated the mass construction of fast cargo ships of 20,000 tons that can sail independently.</p>
<p>The ship he proposed has the upper structure exposed above the water surface reduced as much as possible, making it difficult for the enemy to detect. The hull has a special structure to defend against mines, and is equipped with strong armament. Contrary to the convoy's slow sailing with the hull exposed on the water surface, he argued that this is the only way to remedy the convoy system that has completely failed recently.</p>
<p>Of course, building such ships requires a fundamental reform of the shipyards. Therefore, shipbuilding entrepreneurs, in order to adhere to the old methods to obtain profits, vehemently oppose this proposal, and point out that waiting for this change of direction to succeed has already lost the essential elements of the times. Recently, the British government seems to have been moved by this argument. According to the report of the Secretary of the Navy Alexander at the parliament, an order has been issued to mass-produce fast, large, armed merchant ships for independent sailing. On the other hand, the United States has not suffered as much of a blow as Britain, so it does not change its original policy and continues to build ships in large quantities according to the original plan.</p>
<p>The aforementioned German submarine warfare has increased the tonnage of sunken ships. At the same time, because the shipbuilding capabilities and military plans of Britain and the United States will create a new situation in the European war. American Life magazine states:</p>
<p>"The loss of shipping capacity is a restriction on all attack plans. Our anti-Axis forces' battlefield is far across the sea, so the transportation of each armed soldier requires ten tons of shipping capacity, and 1.5 tons of shipping capacity must be maintained every month. Submarines are the best weapon that Germany has, so this submarine war will become more intense in the future!"</p>
<p>Reading the magazine's words, one can see that there are major factors that make the future of submarine warfare unpredictable. However, if the enemy's shipbuilding capabilities, especially those of the United States, are unilaterally underestimated, it will cause a major failure. The Axis powers should be fully vigilant about this point. American Rear Admiral Land stated when meeting with reporters on the 19th of last month:</p>
<p>"The United States newly built 1.23 million tons of cargo ships in February, setting the highest monthly record. On average, four new ships are launched every day. In the coming May, an average of five ships will be built every day. Therefore, the total number of ships planned for this year is 18.89 million tons, and the plan to produce 20 million tons per year will be realized in 1944."</p>
<p>If this number has the possibility of being realized, then, even if it is not driven by the anxiety of Britain and the United States about submarine countermeasures, it is probably also due to the preparation of the second front plan! Leaving aside the truth of this number, even if only half of the budget can be realized, and Germany maintains its record of sinking an average of 600,000 tons of enemy ships per month, the shipbuilding rate of Britain and the United States has already exceeded the sinking rate of Germany. If they want to sink them all, it is as difficult as waiting a hundred years for the Yellow River to clear. Therefore, it is a necessary requirement for German submarines to start a new offensive with a new face. At the same time, this active sea front directly gives a major impact to the eastern and North African fronts. From past examples, around April and May, when the North Atlantic thaws, is the season when the tonnage of regular ships sunk by the German submarine fleet increases dramatically. The future activity of the German submarine fleet hides the key to the future of the war, which is extremely noteworthy. (Translation: From the March 29th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<h3>Shanghai News Association Held a Tea Party Yesterday to Welcome the Japanese Cultural Delegation; The Atmosphere at the Venue was Harmonious and the Mood was Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>The Japanese cultural delegation, represented by Mr. Saito Hibiki, Mr. Okushi Toyodai, and Mr. Sato Takeo, are prominent figures in the Japanese cultural sphere. They are visiting Shanghai after participating in the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital in Nanjing and the Sino-Japanese Cultural Conference National Representative Assembly. The Shanghai News Association, recognizing the rare opportunity presented by the delegation's visit to Shanghai, initiated a tea party at the China Building Hotel's eighth floor to host them. Before 3 PM yesterday, colleagues from the Chinese and Japanese news media in the city, as well as cultural figures and Mr. Feng, the Director of the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office, Chen Binsu, Xu Liqu, Jin Xiongbai, Zhou Yueran, Zhu Yongkang, Liu Yusheng, Tao Kangde, Gu Fengcheng, Zhou Lian, Zheng Hongyan, and others arrived one after another. Mr. Sato, with his scholarly demeanor, was the first to arrive, followed by Mr. Okushi and Mr. Saito. All the representatives stood up to greet them warmly. For a time, the atmosphere at the venue was harmonious and the mood was enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Welcome Speech by the Shanghai News Media</p>
<p>Chairman Chen Binhe was the first to stand up and deliver a brief welcome speech, stating that the three representatives of the Japanese cultural delegation were visiting Shanghai after their trip from Nanjing. He expressed his deep gratitude for the opportunity to gather together. Although the time was short and the hospitality was simple, he assured them that their intention to welcome them was very strong. Next, Director Feng delivered a speech, saying that all contributions to human life belong to culture. As those who are engaged in promoting culture through writing, he felt it was most important. Every country and nation has different points in life and culture, so there are boundaries. Now, the two major nations of China and Japan are engaged in integrating the entire East Asian culture into one, and he hoped that the influential figures in the friendly cultural sphere would provide as many opinions as possible so that Sino-Japanese culture could be promoted and developed. Afterwards, Mr. Yu Xiongbai expressed his opinion, saying that the East Asian League led by Chairman Wang listed cultural communication as one of the four major guidelines. Therefore, he hoped that the two major nations of China and Japan, who share the same script and the same race, would strive to communicate culturally and seek development for the permanent peace and common welfare of East Asia. He also hoped that the three envoys would convey the determination of our country and the will of the people to the government and the public in their country so that the two nations could understand each other deeply and establish permanent peace.</p>
<p>Speeches by the Delegation Representatives</p>
<p>After the representatives of the news media finished their speeches, Mr. Okushi, a representative of the delegation, stood up amidst continuous applause and delivered a speech, stating that China and Japan should create eternal peace. It goes without saying that there will be many difficulties in the future. However, the stronger the belief in peace, the more intense the spirit of fighting difficulties. Eternal peace absolutely requires cultural integration, and only through cultural integration can its foundation be laid. Peace cannot be achieved only through military or political means. True peace is established by the mission undertaken by culture. However, culture must not be abstract as the concept of the past. Eastern culture is not for individuals, but for the entire nation. True culture must abandon oneself and become one with the masses. The spirit of Confucius in China and Sakyamuni in India are both here. The true spirit of Japan's national polity is also here. At this time, if China and Japan each devote themselves to loving true culture, then the exchange of Sino-Japanese culture must be realized. Cultural exchange cannot be achieved only through diplomatic rhetoric. We must love the truth and improve ourselves mutually. He hoped that colleagues in the cultural circles of China and Japan would join hands and stand up to strive to realize cultural exchange.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Mr. Sato Takeo stood up to express his opinion, stating that the culture produced in one country has weak strength and a short life. A strong culture, a long-lasting culture, is one that absorbs the culture of other countries and uses it as nourishment to grow. Therefore, we cultural figures must absorb the culture of other countries with a humble attitude to nourish and cultivate our own culture. So we should study Chinese culture and cooperate with it, and also hope that Chinese cultural figures will study Japanese culture and strive to promote Chinese culture. He is a specialist in the study of architectural culture, let's take architecture as an example. Ancient Japanese architecture was influenced by China, so are ancient Japanese buildings exactly the same as ancient Chinese buildings? Definitely not. Also, since the Meiji Restoration, Japanese culture has been greatly influenced by Western culture, but how long will it take to become Japanese culture? This is the same for both China and Japan. We cultural figures must use a humble attitude to absorb the culture of other countries and develop the culture of our respective countries.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Saito Hibiki expressed his great insights and opinions, which are worthy of our reference. At around 5 PM, the guests and hosts agreed to meet again in the future and dispersed happily.</p>
<h3>Municipal Health Bureau Recruits Epidemic Prevention Medical Personnel</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau, in light of last year's cholera outbreak and its rapid spread, is focusing on summer public health and implementing early preparations in order to thoroughly eradicate the bacteria. It plans to expand its epidemic prevention work and establish epidemic prevention inoculation teams to carry out inoculation work in various districts. However, due to the very vast working area, the number of people needed is insufficient. It has now decided to recruit 22 male physicians, 44 male and female nurses, 22 male clerks, and 16 male disinfectants with considerable experience.

<h3>Commentary: The Talent Problem in the Financial and Industrial Circles</h3>
<p>"Talent is hard to find" is a famous saying from ancient times. Today, the development of the financial and industrial sectors can be said to be very impressive on the surface, and the future seems to be very optimistic, but if the progress of the business does not keep pace with academic knowledge and technology, the future is very worrying.</p>
<p>In any business, factory, or company today, the lack of capital is not a concern, and profits are not a concern. The biggest source of problems is the extreme emptiness of talent, especially the lack of management and technical personnel. Therefore, every time we do something or start a business, the most painful thing is that there are too few talented people.</p>
<p>We believe that government agencies or public organizations must adhere to two principles when selecting talent: first, they must not be partisan or engage in cronyism; and second, they must gather opinions from all sides. In addition, there is another point that is most important, which is the training and cultivation of talent. Taking the financial and industrial sectors as an example, it is very dangerous to start a business today without talent as the cornerstone and backing. Why are financiers and entrepreneurs not paying attention and quickly training this group of future management talent?</p>
<p>In addition to teaching specialized knowledge, the training method should focus on practical exercises in order to obtain real experience and knowledge. Then, improving the shortcomings of the past in various industries will be very convenient. At the same time, it is necessary to establish specialized educational institutions and provide funding for clerks, assistants, and trainees from various companies to study inside, so that experience and theory can be mutually verified. This is the urgent task at hand. The subjects should not be too many, but should be practical; the curriculum should not be too deep, but should be suitable for practice. Talent is the most valuable asset in the business world, and the financial and industrial circles should not ignore this saying.</p>

<h3>Commercial Control Association Temporarily Suspends Issuance of Permits for Moving Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai: In order to thoroughly investigate speculation in yarn and cloth, the Department of Industry has sent a letter to the Commercial Control Association stating that the registered yarn and cloth inventory should be temporarily suspended from movement. The Commercial Control Association should also dispatch personnel with relevant trade associations to conduct spot checks. If unregistered yarn and cloth inventory is found, the Economic Bureau or the Public Works Department should be notified immediately to detain the goods pending investigation. It is understood that in addition to notifying various yarn and cloth merchants to comply with the regulations, the Commercial Control Association has also ordered the Materials Movement Permit Office to temporarily suspend the issuance of permits for yarn and cloth merchants to apply for the movement of yarn and cloth.</p>
<h3>Director of the Central Market Investigation Office, Okano, Goes to Ningbo to Investigate</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai: In order to adapt to the wartime economic system, the Central Market will reorganize the brokers' associations in various industries into collection and distribution investment associations. The industry associations were established one after another last month. The market also established an evaluation committee to manage the fair prices of goods delivered by the industry associations. It is understood that the market has completed the reorganization of the organization. In order to exert its new functions and adjust the prices of essential living materials to reduce the burden on citizens, the market has specially dispatched Okano Shigeru, the Director of the Investigation Office, and his staff members Nishino Itaru and Ogasawara Kane to Ningbo, Zhenhai, Shenjiamen, Huangyan, Xiangshan, and other places today (9th) to conduct actual investigations on the local production, transportation, and customs declaration of materials, and to contact local military and political bureaus to ensure smooth flow of materials and reduce costs. The estimated journey is two weeks. Citizens are looking forward to Okano's trip.</p>
<h3>Central Savings Association Expands Organization</h3>
<p>After the Central Savings Association was released from military management, it was submitted to the National Government through the Ministry of Finance and designated the Central Reserve Bank to take over the business with allocated funds. Tang Shoumin, Ye Fuxiao, and other fifteen people were appointed as supervisory committee members. The association was reorganized and resumed business on April 1, starting new business. It is reported that the internal organization has now expanded to eight major sections, namely, document, accounting, design, securities, business, cashier, personnel, and general affairs. The association also plans to establish a prize-winning savings bond savings department in the near future.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on the National Commercial Control Association (III)</h3>
<p>— Also Speaking On</p>
<p>(III) The Purchase Price of Materials Should Be Impartial: Attention must also be paid to the purchase of materials, otherwise it will not only fail to increase production, but will also hinder it. In addition to the procedures being simple and quick, and the staff being honest and clean, attention must be paid to the pricing of the materials. If the price is too high, it will increase the cost of finished products and indirectly increase the level of general prices. Conversely, if the price is too low, it will hinder the purchase work, create a shortage of raw materials, and reduce industrial production. The result is also a shortage of materials and high prices. The reason why the past cotton procurement work could not proceed smoothly was that the officially set price was too low. If farmers sell their cotton at the official price, the price they get is not enough to buy the items they need (such as yarn and cloth). Therefore, farmers mostly use their own cotton to spin yarn and weave their own native cloth. If this situation continues to exist, it will create self-sufficiency in rural areas. The food and raw materials produced in rural areas will not be able to be exchanged for urban industrial products. The final result will inevitably force the city into a dead end. Therefore, how to adjust the purchase of materials and promote the smooth progress of the purchase work is the first point that the association should pay attention to.</p>
<p>(IV) The Allocation Quantity Should Be Increased: In the past, the quantity of raw materials allocated under material control seemed to be too small. For example, the quantity of chemicals (caustic soda, glycerin, etc., allocated from water), pig iron, and raw cotton allocated was too small, so that the word "allocation" became nominal. After the establishment of the Commercial Control Association, it should strive to avoid this problem. All materials purchased from Central China and exchanged from South China and North China must be distributed to Chinese and Japanese manufacturers in Central China as much as possible. In addition, it is necessary to strive for fair allocation. In the past, most of those who could obtain allocation were a small number of members of the association or group, while most of the manufacturers engaged in real production could not obtain allocation and could only purchase from the black market at high prices. This abnormal state creates a black market. After the establishment of the Commercial Control Association, it cannot allow this state to continue to exist.</p>
<p>The above points are only based on my usual observations, and are stated concisely. In addition, how the staff should be honest and clean, and how the procedures should be simple and quick, are all factors that affect the success or failure of the control. I think the gentlemen of the Commercial Control Association are well aware of this. (End)</p>
<h3>Special Donation Office for Silk Construction Established with Five Sub-offices in Suzhou, Hangzhou, etc.</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai: The Special Donation Office for Silk Construction in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui of the Ministry of Finance has been established for two years. Previously, in order to facilitate the promotion of the special donation tax policy in various places, it had been collecting special donations on behalf of the local consolidated tax authorities. On January 1 of this year, the General Taxation Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui was reorganized into six bureaus, including the Provincial Taxation Bureau, the Stamp Tax Bureau, and the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau. Therefore, the office has established five sub-offices in Suzhou, Wuxi, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Wuxing, and other areas where silk production is most prosperous in order to smoothly promote the tax policy.</p>
<h3>Huazhong Mining Company Actively Promotes Business</h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese joint venture Huazhong Mining Company celebrated its fifth anniversary on the 8th. Since its establishment, the company has spared no effort in developing resources. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it decided to actively develop iron ore, fluorite, manganese, and other industrial plans in order to supply the needs of expanding ironmaking and cultivate combat power. Therefore, the amount of copper, iron, manganese, fluorite, and other materials mined each year is astonishing. The company also sent special geological resource survey teams to various places to explore and extract the endless underground resources. The results were very good.

<h3>Translation of Historical Chinese Newspaper Sections</h3>
<h3>Translated Commentary: Simplification of the Economic Sphere</h3>
<p>The economy of Central China has become a simplified one, thanks to the appropriate measures taken by both the National Government's participation in the war and the Japanese side.</p>
<p>The nature of currency is solely to ensure smooth circulation and stability. Within the same economic sphere, even if the exchange rates between different currencies remain unchanged, the fundamental function of currency cannot be ideally realized. Since the incident, various currencies have coexisted in Central China, leading to monetary chaos. This chaos was eliminated during last year's currency reform. With the cessation of issuing military scrip and new banknotes this time, a single currency system has been realized, unifying the economic sphere of Central China.</p>
<p>The material aspects of Central China will also be integrated, thanks to the abolition of restrictions on the movement of goods. Currently, it is a transition period from the past controlled methods to new ones.</p>
<p>In the future, the economy of Central China will not be a so-called free-market economy, but a controlled economy. Its purpose is to correct the tendencies of regional economic egoism and self-sufficiency, enabling the economy of the entire Central China region to flow freely everywhere.</p>
<p>The currency of the entire Central China region has already been unified. If goods can also circulate freely, then, due to the close relationship between currency and goods, prices can also be simplified. However, this does not mean that prices will be uniform everywhere in Central China after simplification. Naturally, location and other factors, such as transportation costs and various other considerations, will need to be taken into account to harmonize price levels.</p>
<p>Only when these measures are gradually implemented can price levels be considered stable. At the same time, everyone can engage in economic activities with peace of mind, and economic recovery will not be difficult to achieve. (Continental News, April 6th)</p>

<h3>Beyond the Five Flavors</h3>
<p>— Zu Wen</p>
<p>In the experiences of life, we can distinguish five flavors: sweet, sour, bitter, spicy, and salty. People in Hunan love spicy food, people in Sichuan eat sweet food, and people in the North always order hot and sour soup at restaurants. There are many people in the South who love salty vegetables and sweet rice cake soup. In my hometown, there is also a saying: "Stinky Nanxun, Spicy Wuzhen." Although these are local customs, generally speaking, among the five flavors, only "bitter" seems to be the least popular. "Playing the qin under a coptis tree, finding joy in bitterness," although some people have said this, finding joy in bitterness is clearly out of compulsion.</p>
<p>Beyond the five flavors, there is another flavor that I think is worth mentioning: the flavor of blandness. In chaotic times, the word "bland" seems most useful. One can be detached and focused on one's aspirations, not greedy for fame and profit, and seek only simplicity in clothing, food, housing, and transportation. The four lines on Maitreya Buddha's bag, "Old and clumsy, wearing a patched robe, content with a simple meal, mending to keep warm, leaving everything to fate," can serve as a footnote to this "blandness." Generally speaking, in the universe, whether it is for people or things, the extreme of splendor must tend towards blandness. Blandness certainly has its own advantages, but the transition from splendor to blandness is a kind of pain, because reminiscing about the past often evokes feelings of nostalgia. Having become accustomed to a luxurious and rich life, it is truly difficult to live a simple and frugal life again. No wonder that throughout history, among millions of people, only a very few are willing to live a detached and contented life.</p>
<p>"A secure body in a humble cottage, a peaceful mind with simple vegetable roots, worldly affairs are seen clearly in tranquility, human relationships last longer with detachment." Because I happened to read this poem, I thought of this "bland" beyond the five flavors. People who are tired of sweet, sour, salty, and spicy, how about trying these bland flavors?</p>
<h3>Second Monthly Essay Contest: Fourth Place Winner. How to Read and What to Read?</h3>
<p>— Wang Chengji</p>
<p>(1) The Importance of Reading</p>
<p>For the sake of survival, I believe everyone is thirsting for knowledge. Therefore, "reading" has become the only good tool for acquiring knowledge. Of course, there are many tools for acquiring knowledge, not necessarily just "reading." However, at least it can be said that it is the most basic method for acquiring knowledge. In this great 20th century, especially in the current trend of survival of the fittest in Shanghai, people cannot exist solely on experience, solely on physical strength, without any knowledge! Therefore, for the sake of survival, everyone needs to read.</p>
<p>(2) Reading Requires Four Attentions</p>
<p>The most common method for reading "skimming" books is "looking." The most common method for reading a "detailed study" book is "reading." However, whether you use your eyes to "look" or your mouth to "read," you must concentrate on reading attentively. If your eyes are looking at the lines of the book, or your mouth is humming and reading the book, but your mind is thinking about other things, what is the result of this kind of reading? Your eyes will become tired, your mouth will become sore, time will pass, and what will you have gained in your heart? Therefore, no matter how you read, in addition to eye attention and mouth attention, you also need mind attention. Mr. Xia Gaizun's so-called "three attentions" of reading refers to this. However, reading with the method of "three attentions" cannot be considered perfect. For example, when reading natural sciences or mathematical sciences, the method of "three attentions" can certainly be applied. However, even if you understand the knowledge in the book, you may not be proficient in applying it. Therefore, you need to use your pen more often. You need to work out the exercises in the book more often. In this way, with your eyes looking, your mouth reciting, your mind thinking, and your pen writing, I believe any difficulty can be solved immediately. Extending this, even when reading literature books, social books, or even any books, you still need to use your pen more often. For example, when reading English vocabulary, naturally your eyes must first focus on the vocabulary, then your mouth must accurately pronounce its syllables, and then your mind must remember its structure. If you write it down with a pen while you are reciting it, then you can remember the vocabulary very quickly. For example, when reading literature (any book is applicable), when you encounter wonderful passages, of course your eyes should appreciate them several times, your mouth should recite them several times, and your mind should recall them several times. However, these methods can only increase your temporary aesthetic appreciation and help your temporary memory. Therefore, in order to gain permanence, whenever you encounter wonderful passages, use colored pens to mark various obvious symbols or use a notebook to write them down. Writing just a few strokes can make your memory more profound. Therefore, we should always use "four attentions" when reading any book. That is, eye attention, mouth attention, mind attention, and hand attention.</p>
<p>(3) What to Read</p>
<p>We should believe that human wisdom is progressing and books are increasing day by day. It is indeed difficult to use one's limited lifespan to read those endless books. Therefore, when we are in this vast "sea of books," the first difficulty is "what to read." Of course, every book has its value of existence. However, not all of them are suitable for my own needs, because I fundamentally have my own aspirations. How can I, at the same time, have the time to read books that are contrary to my aspirations? However, as long as there is time, correct books can be selected and read in a regular manner.</p>
<p>If all the spare time is used to read the books that you want to read, you will inevitably feel monotonous and dry. This may even reduce your interest in reading. Therefore, when our mind is already quite tired, we should immediately, in a measured and regular manner, switch to reading some books that are helpful for personal improvement and cultural cultivation as a tool to adjust our mind. Reading this kind of book can not only adjust your mental over-tension, but also serve as a tool for your reading, and at the same time, it can also allow you to recognize the lifelong struggles of great figures in history, increasing your immense experience.</p>
<p>In short, no matter what books we read, we always deny the "scholarly" promiscuity. But in order to increase the effectiveness of reading, some tools are indispensable! Such as reference books, books that are helpful for personal improvement and cultural cultivation, etc. Therefore, our conclusion on what to read is: "We must cultivate a specialty from the books we choose to read, and we do not need to become a commonplace general store from the books we read!" (Editor's Note: This article is about 5,000 words in its entirety. In order to save space, only a few excerpts are provided. We hope the author will forgive us.)</p>
<h3>The Cloth Stall</h3>
<p>— Written by Tianming</p>
<h3>Aesthetic Sense</h3>
<p>— Ji Chen</p>
<p>Only "beauty" can inspire our minds, enabling us to cultivate excellent character, noble sentiments, pure hobbies, and sensitive feelings. Only "aesthetics" can dispel worries, making us happy, kind, and at peace with our work.</p>
<p>A person will never be able to detach themselves from "beauty" and immerse themselves in the realm of rudeness and煩惱 all day long, and be able to accomplish a great work. When a "beautiful" thing is placed among many broken items, we will immediately realize which one is the most "beautiful" because "beauty" can make our minds emit a mysterious power to concentrate our attention. Therefore, we can understand that the achievements of many great works in history are due to the influence of "beauty."</p>
<p>Macedon said: "Love for 'beauty' has the power to cultivate a gentle and virtuous character. The most unfortunate thing is to place a child in an environment where they love money as their life, so that they will develop a goal in life that does not prioritize personality but only pursues money."</p>
<p>This sentence seems to be directed at the present time and place. Although we are not children, we are still young. Let us strive to cultivate a love for "beauty", an aesthetic mind, and the power of aesthetics! Also, do not neglect to cultivate our children to love "beauty" and aesthetics.</p>
<h3>On Leading by Example</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhiming</p>
<p>"Leading by example," don't underestimate that this is a cliché. Many people fail to follow it, leading to a lack of coordination between superiors and subordinates, families declining, and society falling into chaos. Those in leadership positions should especially never forget it. For example, if you are a superior and can "lead by example," being diligent first, being realistic and pragmatic, and being fair and impartial, then subordinates will surely compete to work hard, be diligent and self-motivated, and not be perfunctory or lazy. How can this not make the enterprise thrive? On the contrary, if you yourself are negligent and fraudulent, abuse your powers, and are selfish and stubborn, then subordinates will certainly not work hard in their positions. The cunning will be perfunctory and evasive, and the loyal will complain and curse. Even "if the superiors like something, the subordinates will overdo it." They imitate each other, causing endless harm. In this way, how can work progress? How can the enterprise develop?</p>
<p>I believe:——</p>
<p>If parents can lead by example, then their children will be virtuous, and the family will be healthy. If the boss can lead by example, then the employees will be loyal, and the business will tend to prosper.</p>
<p>If the rulers can lead by example, then the government will be well-governed, and society will be peaceful.</p>
<p>If all levels and layers can lead by example, then the country will inevitably become rich and strong. I hope everyone can follow this principle.</p>
<h3>Roots</h3>
<p>— Xin Bo</p>
<p>They sat for a while. The clouds in the sky became a little thicker. Ah Wu stood up first and said, "I'm afraid it's going to rain. We should leave early." He paid for the tea.</p>
<p>Da Gen looked at Ah Wu paying with a red face because he was not prepared and did not have a penny in his pocket. He had to say, "Ah Wu Ge, I'm really sorry."</p>
<p>Ah Wu said, "It's nothing." Saying this, he still led the way, leading Da Gen out of the back door, into a slightly decorated back garden, and then out of the yellow stone walls, and then squeezed into the crowd of tourists heading north.</p>
<p>A burst of loud gong sounds came from the north, followed by a large team of people burning incense meat. They were all young and strong lads, all wearing white cloth short shirts, tied with women's pleated silk skirts, with the two corners tucked up, one hand holding a hammer, and the other hand hanging a gong. They would walk a few steps and strike a few times. The gong was hung on dozens of steel hooks, and the upper ends of the steel hooks were hung on the skin below the right elbow. As if it were a gong of dozens of pounds, the skin would be stretched down, several inches long. It is said that this is a vow to "repay the mother's kindness."</p>
<p>"I also really want to burn incense meat once," Ah Wu said. "Damn it, I can't get away. I definitely won't miss it next year."</p>
<p>Da Gen smiled and did not continue to speak.</p>
<p>Several teams of incense pilgrims walked down from the straight-up mountain top steps. They all wore long gowns, wore coolie hats, held incense oranges in their hands, chanted in their mouths, and bowed down step by step. That kind of pious energy can really startle heaven and earth and move gods and ghosts. They were all villagers, old and young.</p>
<p>"I say worshiping incense is quite interesting," Da Gen casually said.</p>
<p>"What's interesting? One step, one bow, just a kowtowing bug. It's better to hang up the gong with holes in your arms, and enjoy the slaughtering!" (27)</p>
