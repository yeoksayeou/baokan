<p>社評</p>
<h3>再論統一推進慈善事業</h3>
<p>我們鑒於上海一地，年來難民難童數量的增多，而生活程度日趨高漲，慈善機關雖有數百單位悉數收容，仍力有未遂，爲此念及慈善事業，急須統一推進，俾從積極處着眼，作有計劃有組織的發展，並使社會上之嚴重現象早獲消泯。前於六月二十六日會撰論，提出「統一推進慈善事業」意見，以期社會領袖出而倡導。旋得上海市貧病救濟協會正副主席開蘭　林康侯袁屢登三氏，發表感想。（全文載七月六日至八日本報第三版）以三氏平素對於公益及慈善事業之熱心與社會各界之信譽，此種卓越之意見，一定能夠喚起市民之注意而促使慈善事業健全的的發展。我們期待此一事業　早見發現，　情之切，實不下於三氏。在上海租界行將交回上海將　新生之際，尤盼各界共同協力，共謀上海　會之健全發展，而慈善事業之同意推進，也當爲重要之一端。</p>
<p>聞林袁三氏對於統一推進慈善事業，所提問題，自非深悉此中甘苦　不能道，內容實極堪所究。不過，我們認爲，第一，關於統一推進，當作整個的處理，不能統一自統一，推進自推進。重要目標，在於上海慈善事業之推進中必須有統一的計劃與步驟。第二，關於誰來統一的問題，我們一部分同意三氏的意見，三氏認爲只由政府或官方來統一，不如各慈善機關自動來統一推進。這並不是說官方的統一不好，不過就目前實際情形而論，無論在各種事業的規模上，設備上，成績上，人材上，都爲官方所不易統一。我們主張應當由政府機關領導與促成統一在先，而由各慈善團體自動統一推進於後。至於第三點，如何統一推進問題，這裏包括組織問題，人材問題，調查·研究·設計及資金諸問題，我們深覺三氏所慮均中肯要，值得喚起各方面的注意與研究。</p>
<p>聞林袁三氏於提出問題之後，列舉統一推進慈善業的困難，最後乃抒述其理想，實際克服困難之辦法，我們於摯誠的同情之餘，竊願再進一言，以就正於三氏及關心本市慈善事業前途的諸君。從統一推進慈善事業的組織方面言，我們認爲目前慈善機關中如確實具領袖性的機關，就不必另起爐灶，加以改組刷新即可。不過必須做到的，第一是這個組織，必須在社會上著有信譽，其工作與事業爲各慈善機關及社會所信仰者；第二，是這個組織，必須吸收過去或迄今仍在辦理慈善事業富有經驗，著有成績的人才，參加設計以及推進工作，必須目前仍在切實辦理慈善事業；第三，這個組織的一切工作，必須是向社會公開的，並且由在社會業著聲望的紳　組織　察機關隨時檢討其工作，接受輿論的批判及　　，以強化其工作效率。我們今日仍　感覺，如上海市貧病救濟協會，不失爲最適任於主持同意推進事業的機關，因爲，上述諸條件，它差　具　了。有許多組織　的工作，他們似乎早已在做了；不過，過去改會的工作範圍，似乎只限於救濟貧病兩者，實際上慈善事業，決不限此二者，而　乎該會　次補助各機關的性質，也不以此二者爲限，假使今後改組擴大，自然工作的範圍更要擴大，包括全部慈善事業。</p>
<p>關於同意推進慈善事業，除了組織之外，最主要的，第一是經費問題，本市數百慈善機關之未能完善達成目的，經費不足，爲重要的原因之一，而目　各慈善機關最大的困難，就我們接觸所知，也只是經費不足。聞林袁三氏提出的有組織的勸募方法，詳盡周密，我們所要補充的是：在收入方面，　要有計劃有組織，實行總動員式的勸募；　除了消極性的救濟，如對於老病殘廢之救濟之外，要特別努力於積極性的救濟，與政府有關方面及金融企業家合作，對於無業流民，赤貧男女，以及少壯乞丐，難民等，開設短期工藝·農墾·牧畜等訓練班，經過相當時期的訓練，即分遣至各適當生產部門從事生產工作，活在必要時自辦生產事業，不必盡賴募捐維持。在支出方面，節約二字，幾乎每一慈善機關都已在節無可節之地步，但在計劃與管理上如能統一籌畫與辦理，實行合理化的辦法，也許好可以減輕經費問題的嚴重化。第二設計問題，一方面集中原有各慈善機關內的真正人才，另一方面，在社會上熱心人士推選專家，再輔以由政府有關方面推選出來的人員，及向友邦聘請的技術人材所組成的「顧問委員會」，（假定名稱）分工合作，以策劃改善及推進慈善事業。我們相信，在各方面的開始合作之下，今後的慈善事業必能獲得應有的效果，聞林袁三氏的理想，是不難實現的。</p>
<p>慈善事業之統一推進，是改造社會的基礎事業，更是助成今日上海社會安定的先決條件，我們希望本市各慈善機關與各界人士機關林袁三氏之後，共抒卓見，協力促其早日實現。</p>

<h3>視察南方完成任務　東條首相安返東京　前後歷時共十三日　政治上具重大意義</h3>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　日情報局十二日下午三時十五分發表東條內閣總理大臣兼陸軍大臣完成訪問泰國及視察南方各軍政地之目的，已於十二日下午三時十五分返抵東京。</p>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　日東修首相兼陸相此次於六月三十日，偕　軍佐藤軍務局長，大東亞省山本次官，外務省上村政務局長，及矢枚　軍大佐，高橋陸軍中佐等隨員，一行由東京啟程前往南方，遍歷越南，泰國，馬萊，蘇門答臘，婆羅洲爪哇，菲鳥等南方軍政第一綫各地，與當地政府首腦及南方軍政官民等舉行懇談，並犒其勞苦，又視察協力建設大東亞之南方住民狀況，獲得極大戰果，茲以任務完畢，已於十二日下午返抵東京，總計前後共歷十有三日。</p>
<p>東條首相等一行於此次南行途中，先於三日在越南西　小駐，聆取當地日陸海軍最高指揮官報告越南軍情，　赴泰京盤谷，在該地躭擱二宵，四日會見泰國畢本首相，協議日泰協同作戰方針，兩方意見完全一致，旋即發表日泰共同聲明，確約將舉英領六州編入泰國領土。至五日　往昭南，會見日南方陸軍最高指揮官寺內元帥，聆取軍情及軍政狀况，並慰勞南方軍兵，又與印度獨立聯盟總裁江特拉鮑斯及緬甸行政府巴莫長官懇談，並檢閱印度國民軍激勵有加。六日赴蘇門答臘·爪哇·婆羅州視察軍情及軍政狀况，並在爪加爾達出席住民感謝大會，歸途又再訪菲島，與菲島行政長官伐爾加斯獨立準備委員長洛勒爾等會談，並視察在軍政下活躍於各地之官民善，分別指示鼓勵，歷時十三日，今已完成全部行程，乃即返國。此次東條首相視察南方，對於完成大東亞戰爭·團結大東亞民族·促成大東亞建設·均有極大影響，故其政治　意義至爲重大。又據此間政界人士意見，認東條首相前旣曾訪問中國滿洲國菲島，此次又經南方視察，故東條首相殆已遍歷大東亞各地，此不但足使大東亞各國家各民族更能加深認識日本之施策與誠意，同時東條目相將因此次親歷之體騐，而更堅強完成戰爭與完成建設之決意與確信，由此而大東亞建設之將更有飛躍展開，實極可　云。</p>
<p>日首相歸國後　發表此行觀感</p>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　日東條首相兼陸相返國後，當即發表談話，說明此行觀感。茲誌其大意如次：余此次奉命前往泰國訪問，與首相畢本等泰國要人開誠懇談，並得目睹大東亞戰爭下之泰國實情，余於此對於泰國國民在畢本首相領導下團結一致，爲謀泰國與隆貫澈大東亞戰爭所作之不斷努力，深表敬意。余深信日泰兩國國民必將因余此次之訪問泰國，彼此更能加深理解，而益加強其貫澈戰爭之決意。尤其關於日本對泰國行將採取之具體協力新方策，日泰兩國總理之意見，業已完全一致，此實深堪慶賀，余此次訪問泰國，同時訪問馬來蘇門答臘及婆羅州，視察各地軍情及住民實情，並得慰勞當地日軍將士及官民者　至欣慰，余在昭南除與緬甸行政府巴奠長官及印度獨立志士江特拉鮑斯舉行會談外，並得有機會檢閱印度國民軍，嗣在爪加爾逃出席當地住民舉行之盛大感謝大會，復於道經馬尼刺時，得與菲島獨立準備委員會委員等舉行會談，實亦至爲愉快。南方各地自　平以來，爲時雖尙僅一年有半，但因原住民之眞　協力軍事經濟文化等極策，進行極爲順利，故殊堪欣慰。余藉此機會，對原住民之協力深表　意。而緬甸及菲島之獨立準備已着著推　及印度納西亞民衆之參加政治亦行將具體實現，一方面印度獨立準備運動正日趨強化，印度獲得自由及繁榮之日爲期當不在遠，此尤　堪同慶者。南方各地多年來處于英美荷三國之支配下，被視爲榨取之對象而完。成爲其殖民地，因此在英美荷統治時代，南方各民族不能稍受敎育而被束縛，以致醉生夢死不知歷發。當此之時，大東亞戰爭之勃發，實爲天與之　　，今兩方各地之民衆已脫離英美荷之羈絆，而負起大東亞民族本來之使命，並已　備大東亞共存共榮之情勢，余自本年三月以來曾訪問中華民國滿洲國以及菲島，此次復又訪問泰國及南方各地，目睹大東亞各國民族已分別負起其本來之使命，向目澈大東亞戰爭途邁進，以謀大東亞之解放及興隆，余於感激聖恩宏大之餘，益增強必勝之信念，而更確信大東亞前途必充滿無限光明。余今已安然返國，原與國民範君共勉，一新鬥志，在聖威之下始終努力不懈，以爭取此大東亞戰爭之最後勝利，而期完成大東亞共榮國，俾具體實現八絋爲宇之偉大理想。</p>
<p>東條首相再度蒞菲　與軍政領袖作懇談</p>
<p>馬尼拉十二日中央社電　日東條首相於十日正午偕山本大東亞省次官·佐滕軍務局長·上村外務省政務局長等隨員抵馬尼拉，黑田最高指揮官·村田最高顧問·及軍政監陸海軍幕僚·菲島獨立準備委員·行政府首腦等均一寒暄後，於市民夾道歡呼聲中，赴馬尼拉飯店休憇。</p>
<p>馬尼拉十二日中央社電　東條首相抵菲島後，與黑田最高指揮官及菲島獨立準備委員等舉行懇談，已獲得劃期之成果。於十一日上午在日本陸海軍最高指揮官幕僚長及行政府首腦等多人歡送下，就歸國之途。</p>
<p>馬尼拉十二日中央社電　東條首相於十晶下午四時菲島獨立準備委員會各委員，馬尼拉飯店懇談四十分鐘，並舉行茶會招待各委員，於療養中之洛勒爾委員長及洛哈斯委員亦均抱病出席。席間由東條首相洛勒爾委員長相繼致詞畢，即就菲島獨立之種種事宜開誠交換意見，茲誌東條首相之致詞與洛勒爾委員長之答辭大意如次：「東條首相致辭大意」余對於準備委員會之成立，及各稱準備事項之積極進展，實不勝欣慰，希望各位委員眞摯努力，迅速完成準備工作，並希望菲島全體民衆一致協力，共同建設新菲島，完遂大東亞戰爭。「洛勒爾委員長答辭大意」菲島獨立委員會各委員，均由菲島各界有誠人中所選出者，故確信必能遠到所期目的。余對於菲島能獲獨立之一事，衷心感謝，余之此種心情，不但可代表菲島一千八百萬民衆之心情，常亦可爲由英美桎梏下獲得解放之全東亞民族所共感者。　等菲島民衆當思及者，獨立之國旗　揚於空中時，其歡欣心情，貫非筆墨所可形容，因此吾人　舉全菲島民衆之力，邁進於新菲島之建設，更對完遂大東亞戰爭盡最大努力之決心。</p>
<p>出席爪哇羣衆大會　勗勉團結努力建設</p>
<p>爪加爾達十二日中央社電　日東條首相於視察南方途次，已於七日上午十一時五十分抵此日原田最高指揮官以下軍官民代表均熱烈恭迎。東條首相於最高指揮官官邸稍憇後，正午即聽取原田最高指揮官報告軍情，並舉行種種懇談。</p>
<p>爪加樂達十二日中央社電　日東條首相七日下午四時半，蒞臨此間堪比爾廣塲舉行之民衆感謝大會，　參加之十萬餘民衆剴　致詞，大意稱：本日得與諸群會面，實感欣快，諸君自大東亞戰事開始以來，即洞悉此次作戰之眞意，並以堅固之團結誠意協力日本。從事新爪哇之建設事業，余對此殊深感謝，今日復親覩此情，是以感念益深。凡我大東亞各地域之各住民，乃係一系統之一大家族，然不怕此大家族已受英美多年壓迫。日本自開戰以來，即於大東亞必勝之體勢下，成爲大東亞之中核，爲　此等大家族由東亞　略者之桎梏中解放，遂發生此次戰事。余曾歷訪中滿　各地，此次復來南方各地視察。所得印象至爲良好，使余對大東亞建設必成之信念愈加堅決。日本即以此必勝必成之信念，決意向擊滅東亞侵略者之途邁進。爪哇於此次之大東亞戰事中，佔有極重要之地位。故諸君對於戰局之前途。實有重大影響。余前　於日本議會中特別聲明　於本年中將予爪哇原住民參與政治權限，是余　　諸君發揮偉大這精神，於現地軍之指揮下，戮力同心從事政治經濟文化各方面之建設。以完成大東亞戰爭，爲達此一致，努力奮鬥，余於此講述所懷，並祈諸君奮祀</p>
<h3>美駐渝空軍　兩度炸越南</h3>
<p>河內十一日中央社電　美駐渝空軍前於十日上午空襲越南東京州後，下午復會再渡來襲擊海防及紅谷地區，均遭轟炸，總計　後兩次突襲，共死住民二十一人，傷四十人云。</p>
<h3>戰時德國學生生活</h3>
<p>德國的總力戰，國家總動員近來已經完成，不必　中學和女學校的學生，就是小學生們了欲在總力戰時代，一顯身手，茲自六歲至十七歲的所謂德國少年國民最近的日常生活，及參加總力戰情形於後：</p>
<p>徹底防空敎育</p>
<p>六·七歲的一年生，上學時以前向由母親迎送，但在總力戰的今日：有許多家庭中的母親到軍需工廠去工作，所以無暇顧到孩子們了，於是孩子們都自動的三·四人結成一衆到學校去。</p>
<p>國民學校仍如前一樣，自晨八時　每日授課五小時。但如隔日晚上有空襲警報，則上課時間延緩二小時。敎員們年輕的都上戰綫去了，所以大多是女敎員及老年的敎員，與國社黨少年團機關聯絡，以期戰略下敎育的完善。關於防空的敎育設備也很周到，而且時當舉行演習，各敎室走廊中都務有沙袋，滅火器等，地下室且備有絕對可供安眠的寢休。食器，換氣設備應有盡有，　護婦在待機中，掃　清潔，使與父兄離散的孩子們不致憂急。</p>
<p>訓練應急措施</p>
<p>戰時兒童敎育的實施極爲實際，敎室，走廊中每適點上新的標語，其題材常先德國的歷史，傳人的肖像或格言，使兒童們都有一種深刻的印象，各兒童每天從家庭中搜集了許多廢物，如紙，爛布塊，屑鐵等送到敎員那裏去，爲何要拚命搜集這許多廢物呢？國家何以有此必要呢？這將來可做些什麼呢？給了很大的彩色圖解，或用電影來加以說明，深切而明晣地印入兒童們的頭腦中。稍爲高級一點的兒家，則敎以負傷時應急措施等實際常識，用賽洛綫包成「負傷者的模型」或在手上或在脚上加以實際的表演。關於這些事情，由黨機關發給敎員們指示一遍敎材的雜誌小冊子等，敎員們依此而把戰時下需特別牢記的重要事情敎導兒童。</p>
<p>兒童健康滿意</p>
<p>對於兒童的健康自然亦極爲注意。兒童的健康，在任何國　學校中與戰前無異，對於自六歲至十四歲的兒童們，德國的國社黨特別組織「林間學校」，申請加入的兒童們，被送至絕對無突襲危險的保養地，海岸等處，利用暑假的　　期中，與敎員門共同攝取良心的榮養。</p>
<p>兒童們除一定的授業外，更須幫助附近的農家，例如提除害蟲，汲水，照料家畜等兒童們所可做的事。在兒童的健康上，則隨時地加以注意，各林間學校宿舍中，時常有專家前來看視詢問：「食事的營養充分嗎？」「衛生狀態如何？」因此，竟設有供兒童的指導者研究的掌燈產，現在共有六三九三名男指導員及三七六七名女指導員在養成中。</p>
<p>此外又另有男敎導員二四八人。女敎導員二七四人，專敎導兒童們修繕被突襲破壞的家庭中的傢俱。如此自從一九四〇年秋以來至今日止，男女兒童們共有三十八萬二千六百十六人之我，用一千六百二十一列特別列車及五十八艘船從突襲最多的地方送至沒有突襲的德國內地，或送至丹麥，挪威，匈牙得，斯洛伐克，保加得來等保養地。</p>
<p>高級生習防空</p>
<p>中等程度學校學生的戰時生活，高級生每日授課六小時，與戰前無異。但最高級的十七歲男子，則必須應召爲「希特勒少年防空兵」，這少年防空兵每週一天從兵營生活回到學校來，每天授業四小時，因這應召而致時間不足者，則省略不必要的課程以補充之。例如取消　法，法語，音樂，體操等課目，語學方面祇限於英語。</p>
<p>這樣，男子中等學校的最高級生讀完其最後一年時，五十八歲並又卒　於「希特勒少年防空兵」，繼之即立刻被徴爲正式的兵士，所以近來升學至中學校以上的高級學校者大爲減少，僅　特殊的工科，醫科者　可升入高級學校這是敎育部在總力戰下不得已的方針。又男子最高級生可於「希特勒少年防空兵」或「希特勒少年自由自愿兵」中任選一途。「希特勒少年自由志願兵」制度制定於一九四二年，除在成爲兵士前受各種技術方面的敎育外，並授以汽車駕駛員，飛行電報員，通信員，水兵等技術敎育，至今日止集中於此而受敎育者有　萬人</p>
<p>農忙期的服務</p>
<p>男子中等學校高級之外的學生們，於七月七日暑假起，完全須在農忙期的收穫中服務，女子則幫助农家的操作家事。但在學期中則與國民學校的兒童向　協力蒐集　物，利用學業的餘睱，在校廳及田集中耕作，以其收獲慰問傷　醫院。</p>
<p>授業的課程與戰前同樣有規則的實施，例如在女子的裁縫時間，由又給布，紗來縫級傷兵醫　用的枕，被，或練習縫級嬰兒的衣類，以謀學業與實際的合理化。這些作品每三個月積聚一次送納至各方面。</p>
<p>但　子的烹飪課程，因不能浪費食糧　的緣故僅止於怎樣烹飪家庭食物的理論，又男子學生在手工時間則製造飛機，軍　和戰車的模型，趁此機會，使其獲悉戰時下工業的重要性及勞働力的必要性。外國語僅英語列爲必修課目，法語已不被重視，這時候首先磨勵「知嚴」的武器，頗　加以注意。（翼：譯自六月廿七日東京朝日新聞。柏林特電）</p>
<h3>日經濟使節團抵京　晉謁主席致敬　當晚谷大使設宴歡迎　各團員發表考察感想</h3>
<p>南京十二日中央社電　日中國經濟考察軒爲小倉正恒氏等一行於十二日下午二時二十分抵此。稍憩後，即晋謁國府汪主席致敬，並分訪褚外交部　，梅寶業部長，及日軍畑總司令官等致意。繼又赴日本海軍醫院慰問傷病士兵。晚七時並應駐華日大使谷正之氏歡宴。</p>
<p>南京十二日中央社電　日本經濟節團業於昨（十二）下午二時二十分抵京，一行計共十二人，由團長小倉正恒率領·茲將團員名單，誌錄如下團長小倉正恒·團員明石照男·南鄉三郎·小寺源吾·吉田千代·作泉山三六濱野恭平·阿久津關一郎·關口猛夫·高木外史等十二人。</p>
<p>南京十二日中央社電　日經濟界碩彦組織之中國經濟考察團一行，由小倉團長率領，於十二日上午九時自　乘車來京，記者立即趨訪，承諾氏就中國通貨金融物價等重要問題。，發表感想如左：</p>
<p>小倉正恒氏談，連日在滬與各方之中國要人，作坦白之交換意見，得知中國之實際狀況。目前上海方面關於物價通貨問題等，頗多須實行妥當之　策，故余深望將由各方聆取之意見爲基礎，就各問題作充分檢討後，爲中國之發展決盡微力。惟中國雖具有悠久歷史之國家，其民族性國　性與日本頗多不同，關於此點，須要有充分認識，實屬必要。尤其現因對華新政策之展開，中國經濟界人士均以極大希望，在努力工作中，故伸張其創意與研究亦屬必要。</p>
<p>明石照南氏談·中國現有龐大之民族資本·另一方面從事生產之勞工設備等條件，亦一應完備，故若能將民族資本導入生產方面，予以活用化，在維持儲備劵之價値上，頗足期待。但目前之中國經濟，此民族醬與生產。均個別活動，步伐不一。此與日本之資金與生產內外一體之運用，頗有差異，故在中國方面，善導洽用民族資本爲目前之急務爲中國發展計，爲建設大東亞共榮國計，望此問題，能從連解決，中日提携，努力邁進。</p>
<p>南鄉三郎氏談，由買易方面看來，華中爲大東亞共榮國內極重要之地區，促進華中與共榮國內各地間之物資交流，亦爲當務之急者，同時對物價通貨之影響亦　大·戰時下船舶之輸送，限制各地域門之各自的活動·爲共榮國發展之前途計·是不必要的應在共榮國全體的綻合計劃之下，實施物　交流，例如由中國　送棉花至日本，由日本　送棉布至泰印，由泰印　運米至華中，這者是各地域以必須品從事合理化輸出入的情形，華中亦應沿此方針，向增加生產之途邁進。</p>
<p>小寺源吾氏談，英美對華之經濟政策，向來是低價收買中國的原料，而將製成品再以高價發給中國。然日本爲中國之自體之發展，實有協助中國增強生產之必要，因之在紡績業方面，不但要努力於棉花之增產，同時亦須顧及紡績業自體的振興。</p>

<h3>哥倫班加拉上空　擊落敵機多架</h3>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　據日軍前綫某基地電：敵機在哥倫班加拉及孟達方而之突襲，日來極爲熾烈八日來襲敵機約有七十架，九日約七十架，十日約百架，均爲戰鬭及轟炸機聯合編隊，日陸海軍陸上部隊以防空砲火猛烈還擊。八日在哥倫班加拉島擊落敵機九架，十日在陣達擊落三架，日方損害極爲輕微。其間日航空部隊亦猛攻新佐治亞倫特巴港·　比亞納島·及庫拉灣方面之敵軍陣地，使敵陸上部隊蒙受鉅創。</p>
<h3>西西里島軸心軍　反攻獲勝利　登陸敵軍後方聯絡截斷　東南岸激戰繼續進行中</h3>
<p>柏林十二日中央社電　海通社訊，負責方面透露：德義生力軍於星期日晨，在各點開始對西西里英美軍橋頭之反攻，並已獲得初步之重要勝利，惟戰事尙發表，僅悉德義軍已擊潰英美部隊，截斷其後方之聯絡，殲滅殘餘之傘兵與縮小其橋頭堡壘。星期日軸心國轟炸機大隊在香車戰鬥機保護之下，繼續猛炸英美軍之登陸部隊</p>
<p>柏林十二日中央社電　據柏林軍界消息：西西里軸心軍主力，留以對付反軸心之入侵軍隊者，已於星期日晨展開猛烈之反攻。海通社消息謂在星期晨間之前，軸心方面之參加保衛者，祇限於海岸警備部隊。又據海通社所傳軍方消息謂，反軸心軍已在島上成立橋頭堡四處，而另有兩次登陸企圖則已被擊退。昨晚該島東南角巴塞洛角附近與叙拉古斯以南，實行登陸。至於第二次在同一地區登陸之企圖，則被當地海岸警備隊所擊退。反軸心第二批登陸船在軍艦多艘保護下，駛入吉拉灣，並在吉拉城附近成立橋頭堡數處，此外又在更西之里加達附近成立兩處橋頭堡。敵軍在瑪薩拉東北之登陸企圖，已因海岸警備隊之抵抗而遭失敗。據云敵軍之進攻西西里，係以傘兵開端，在星期六黎明時紛紛降落於該島之東南角。此間軍界人士指稱，傘兵降落之區域，人煙稀少，頗使得於成立大規模之橋頭堡，惟據官方宣佈，此項傘兵之大部皆被殲滅，衹有若干小股，遁入賴加陸以西之山陵區內，未被捕獲云。</p>
<h3>義魚雷機　猛襲敵船艦</h3>
<p>羅馬十二日中央社電　斯蒂芬尼社訊：義大利空軍自星期五晚，開始參加西西里海峽及沿西島東南海岸之戰鬥。重轟炸機在馬爾太與西西里海岸之間轟擊敵方船隊，連接數陣，藥捐敵船甚多。同時義大利轟炸機亦猛炸馬爾太之拉凡達港，將行將離港之商船及輕型登陸船多艘炸毀。星期日義機隊昌敵方之猛烈高射砲火，在海岸附近低空襲擊敵軍加以重創。追逐機部隊亦向駛向海岸之敵登陸艦隊攻擊，毀其登陸船多艘。其後由戰鬥機保護之俯衝轟炸機，襲擊保衛嚴密之商船，巨型之商船一艘被擊中兩彈，其他較小之船隻亦被擊中。義鬥機與「米克爾」式轟炸機及噴火機交戰時，曾擊落反軸心炸機兩架，尙有敵轟炸機十架及噴火機多架受重創。昨晚義機仍繼續截擊西西里海面之敵軍，臽進擊任務之長程轟炸機亦擊中船隻數艘，曾見敵船多艘着火，不久繼之發生爆炸。其他轟炸機隊亦迭次向西西里敵方之艦隊·中型商船·及登陸船攻擊，魚雷機連接截擊敵艦隊尤奏奇效。第一次襲擊時，曾有一船被擊中而爆炸，頭見其係載有彈藥及爆炸品，是後並曾重創一萬五千噸之船一艘。參與呈役之魚雷機。曾遭夜戰機之襲擊，另有魚雷機一隊襲擊敵艦隊，擊中七千噸之敵巡艦兩艘，其一已受重創，應認爲業已沉沒，此外又有六千噸之運輸船一艘亦着火，船員乘船逃命。第二次出動作戰之魚雷機，亦屢遭敵戰鬥機之攻擊，敵機並追襲義機至根據地，義機並截擊法屬北非海面之敵艦以阻敵方之供　抵達西西里。下午十時廿十分，義魚雷機一架在距比安科魚五哩處襲擊八千噸之船一艘，該船被擊中而起爆炸，另有　　逐艦兩　護航之五千噸貨船一艘，亦爲義魚雷機擊沉。</p>
<h3>史汀生抵倫敦　參加重要會議　途經永島視察駐軍</h3>
<p>里斯本十一日中央社電　據倫敦消息：美國陸軍部長史汀生上校本日抵美，作重要商討。據云，史氏在赴英途中，貫順道在水島登陸。</p>
<p>瑞典京城十二日中央社電　海通社訉萊克傑維克消息，該城官方宣稱：美國陸長史汀生自美國前往英國，乘便訪問水島，渠拜訪水島政府，並視察軍事機關及駐　該處之美軍。</p>
<h3>庫斯克突出點　戰事愈演愈烈　雙方調生力軍增援　行軍攻勢續有進展</h3>
<p>斯德哥爾摩十二日中央社電　德軍昨奪得貝爾哥洛特附近與奧勒爾以南之新據點，爲其攻入蘇軍陣綫之基地。昨日爲德軍反攻庫斯克突出點之弟七日，坦克車與機械化部隊之兇猛，戰鬥已大見加緊。莫斯科傳出消息謂德方將領克齊格將軍已調生力之坦克車飛機與陸軍加入戰鬥，雙方雖皆遭重大損失，但進攻之力量毫未鬆懈，蘇方謂紅軍日正組織反攻，以應付德軍之突入。並調用大批生力後備隊及重砲。惟德方戰訉則謂，行軍剛進之勢並未稍衰。貝爾哥洛特以東之大森林區內，德機械化部隊曾由飛機協助，在若干地方深入蘇軍陣綫，德軍沿唐納資東岸之戰果，皆係擊敗集中該區之強大蘇軍而始行獲得者，德軍行動雖受大雨及困難地勢之阻礙，但仍能充分發展其攻勞，奧勒爾以南蘇軍曾以重坦克進攻，但爲德軍所擊退。並毀其坦克車二十八輛。另一隊德軍曾冒險作包抄行動，結果俘獲坦克車二九輛及大砲四十四尊。戰事最激烈之處，即爲行軍楔形行動前進之根據地，蘇軍指揮部現亦正在集中大軍於該處及距貝爾哥洛特約二十哩許楔形之北端，兩軍在該處曾有血戰。據路透計駐莫斯科訪員聲稱，德方克魯格將軍昨日大舉進攻，即在上述兩地，德軍曾以大隊後備兵加入貝爾哥洛特附近之戰鬥，而在奧勒爾與庫斯克區亦同時發生猛烈之新攻勢。此項攻擊係於上午六時開始，進攻前曾以飛機及重砲轟擊。然後坦克車與摩托化步兵繼之，進攻地點與前一日相同，即爲鐵道附近之某城，蘇方已承認德坦克車隊曾侵入數處，據路透社訊，星期六曾有德蘇飛機三百餘架，作大規模空戰。柏林方面估計最初六日中，蘇軍之損失總數共計坦克車一·七〇九輛，飛機一·一九七架，此外恐尙有八百架未返根據地。</p>
<h3>印督採取　懷柔政策　三白政治犯開釋</h3>
<p>斯丹埠十二日中央社電　據新德裡來電：印總督府此次已突然無條件釋放監禁中之政治犯三百十八人，其中且有去年裏李因參加　英運動被捕之國民會議派鬥士甚多。衆認印總督府此舉，因江特拉鮑斯急劇展開印度獨立運動，故於狼狽焦慮之餘乃向會議派懷柔政策，以圖緩和印度國內之獨立運動云。</p>
<h3>防止第五　縱隊活動</h3>
<p>里斯本十二日中央社電　傳印度總督府於本月五日由印督主持之下，召開防務會議亘三日之久，協議一般對策，據泰晤士報新德裡特派員述稱，印度防務會議連續召開三日，於五日閉會，內長馬克利威爾曼於會間詳細報告印度境內第五縱隊活躍之情形，以及擾亂份子與第五縱隊之一斑，此報告已引起各方之注目</p>
<h3>捷前總統　在莫斯科　東南歐洲問題　必在討論之列</h3>
<p>斯德哥爾摩十二日中央社電　據海通社訊：「瑞典晚報」駐倫敦訪員評述蘇駐英大使邁斯基之返莫斯科，指出倫敦對貝奈斯亦在蘇　之注意。因此可推論莫斯科現時所討論者，除蘇波糾紛外，尙有東南歐之邊界及領土問題。</p>
<h3>西南太平洋　劇烈地震</h3>
<p>倍諾斯愛勒十一日中央這電　據信太平洋西南部曾發生地震，據美國馬薩諸塞州之威斯頓地方消息，該地之地震紀錄，表明太平洋西南地區之某處，曾有劇烈地震亘兩小時半之久云。</p>

<h3>英國悲劇的餘論</h3>
<p>— 德富豬一郎　（三）</p>
<p>假使依年代調查在英國皇帝的誕生日所發表的授爵，　　一覽表，而解說其因緣由來，雖不能一一加以說明，但其主要的則全視其捐納於正常的金額之多少，而定其爵位與　　的等級。所以如其研究那捐納者是誰時，自然可以明白當中有猶太人的錢在作祟。據說羅滋倍利卿在其少年時代抱著三個希望：第一，他希望娶一個有錢的妻子，第二，在賣倍養馬中獲勝，第三，陛至首相的地位，他的確做了可是世界第一的羅斯吉爾特家的　婿。在賣倍的養馬中也獲勝了。至於第三個希望，雖不能說久，但終究在暫時間　了一任首相，羅斯吉爾特家不用　自然是猶太來了。如此猶太人的血液，滔滔地流入了英國貫族的中心。羅滋倍利　婿即果留　爵。我們不難想像，猶太的血液無孔不入。而這不過是共一例罷了。</p>
<p>法國人曾說，自克雷孟校以至喬萊斯，所有法國的政治家沒有不被猶太人的手所干涉者　話！否確實，不敢保證，但法國爲了猶太政治家，爲了金權而滅亡的事，則是擺在我們面前的實際敎訓。即如德國，前　帝威廉二世，寵任當時的汽船王巴林，幾與其叔父愛德華七世寵用哆塞爾一樣。馬林在第一次世界大戰的前後自殺，但其自然的原因不明。他從猶太的見堆盡力使英國和德國保持和平，則是可僧的。總而言之，世界上任何國家，沒有不被猶太人的手所　動的。世人把英人　西爾繼滋眷做英國的大英雄。他企劃從好望角至埃及開羅的幹綫　　，其計劃確很雄大，然而他不與南非的猶太人舉說携手，致未成功。最初與之相鬥，後來看到沒有勝的希望，祇能和他携手，於是羅滋也變成猶太人的俘虜，羅滋在英國的政界投下了許多的金錢，尤以向愛爾蘭自治黨首領派納爾獻納　　大的黨費，但間接看來，則是猶太人的錢經過羅滋而操縱愛爾蘭黨，如此，我們雖道，能說羅滋直接促畢脫借錢而獻於愛爾蘭自由黨嗎？</p>
<p>的　　　巴爾　是英國保守黨的名門，係薩爾　倍利卿的姪子。他有金錢，有地位，有學問，而容貌亦甚秀麗，可以說是一個十全十美的人。沒有另外必須依靠猶太人的必要，然而第一次世界大戰中的他的所謂「宣書」，亦美國出了很大的亂子。他的宣言現在不必在此詳說，一九一七年十一月二日，給　斯吉爾特這樣一封信：「陛下的政府，嘉　在巴勒士坦爲猶太人創立一個國家，爲完成其目的，將傳用最大的努力吧！當然這樣做並不妨窖原巴勒士坦的非猶太人們的利益，且也不妨窖猶太人在另國所享有的政治上的立塲及獲利。」</p>
<p>不幸這一封信使猶太人相信英國用最大的力量爲猶太人在巴勒士坦創造一個國家，因而猶太人在第一次世界大戰中踴躍地參加英國方面。原來巴勒士坦那地方，是因耶穌敎而被知於世界，大半是　　的土地，祇導供利用，但無論如何那地方是不足以供養一百五十萬以上的人口的。可是當時已有一百萬阿拉伯人定居於此。然而爲了這宣言，自一九二三年至一九三三年的十年間，猶太人自入萬三千人增加至二十三萬人，於是猶太人　　拉伯人　　　然發生了許多糾紛。</p>
<p>當時英國任命前述的通信大臣薩繆爾爲首任的最高委員。因爲他是治理猶太人最爲適宜的人，然而適於治理猶太人的人，不一定也適於治理阿拉伯人。原來阿拉伯人中有洛倫斯者，仰承英國政府的意志而懷柔阿拉伯人，和阿拉伯人約定如　他們幫助英國，則英國將恢復舊阿拉伯的大領土，因此阿拉伯人與英國人雖形同水火，卒致幫助英國。然而現在英國不履行對雙方的任何約束，致洛倫斯卒死於非命，總之，英國雖料猶太人有所偏愛，但實力則在於阿拉伯人之手。如此，巴勒士坦直　　日雙方迄未實踐約束，致英國失　了在西亞的信用　　力。</p>
<p>至於英國在巴勒士坦所施的虐政，基爾特家旭著有「英國的恐怖政治」一盡詳加論述，依其所言，巴爾福故在說謊，但洛倫斯　在說謊。如其讓英國人自己來　體，或許有相當的理由，但巴爾福宣言的結果，終究是極爲重大的。英國在西亞勢力的失　，無　是由此而來。然而　加以詮釋，　猶太之力的表現的一端。　英國者，　　猶太的　案。（第一　完）　交未定　（　　　　每日新聞）</p>

<h3>滬兩租界收回後　稅收可吿統一　市黨部等擴大收回租界宣傳</h3>
<p>（中央社滬訊）友邦日本爲實踐援助我國完成領土主權之完整，樂於六月三十日與國府成立交囘上海公共租界協定，八月一日起即實行由政府收囘公共租界一切行政權。至法租界交還問題，亦已由褚外長來滬與法當局進行交涉中。本月底前當可實現。此後在上海一切財政推進，當較過去更趨順利。中央社記者特往訪中央在滬各稅收機關，探詢今後租界收囘後稅收前途。特分誌如次…</p>
<p>統稅特稅</p>
<p>統稅爲我國財政稅源之大宗，尤其上海爲工國通商大埠，工廠林立，商肆櫛比，各種貨品如棉紗·棉布·捲烟·麺粉·麥，礦產·水泥等，均由滬廠製產，集散各地。統稅納收，以上海爲主體，惟因租界關係，我政府稅政，不能伸征收，查緝工作除捲税曾與租界協定執行查緝　其他貨品統稅查緝工作，均受阻礙，以致走私漏稅，無法施行查緝，影響稅收甚鉅，此次租界交還我國後，稅政當可統一推行，查緝稅政範圍　　執行一切統稅特稅偷漏，當可逐漸　　，稅收勢必較增加，現財政部稅務　緝處已手進口研究收囘租界後　緝稅務整個辦法。</p>
<p>所得稅</p>
<p>所得稅爲人民應盡納稅義務。國外施行已久，我國政府近年來推行，已有進步，最近經財政部所得稅處積極調整後，各　所得稅政，已納入正軌，廿九年度稅收僅有幾百萬元，但至三十一年度已增收二千萬元左右。其中雖以上海區征收局稅收爲多。但因租界特特　，推動迭受阻滯，非但在滬外僑商人不申報納稅義務，即華商應納所得稅額，亦因循滯報，所得稅徵收當局，則因租界特殊關係，不能認眞推動。此亦影響稅收一大障碍。租界收囘後凡在上海市區內之商民，無論任何國籍僑商，均有納稅義務，行政權旣告統一，所得稅收推動，當較順利進行，而商民亦無法逃匿遠抗報稅，預計稅收可增加三分之一以上</p>
<p>收回租界擴大宣傳</p>
<p>本市市黨部以公共租界法租界均將收囘，凡我市民，莫不興奮慶幸，爲使全市民眾明瞭收囘租界之意義，與今後之認　起見，特於昨日下午二時在該部召集各區黨部常委舉行會議，商討決定擴大宣傳及舉行慶祝大會，聞將與本市各有關機關着手籌備。</p>
<p>上海特別市宣傳外爲遵照宣傳部頒佈之交還上海租界擴大宣傳計劃第七項，編着「大上海進行曲」之規定。茲已着手進行聞該項歌曲，已呈請陳市長撰詞，並聘請專家作曲。預定於交還租界之日，由市政府明令公佈。</p>

<h3>第三屆「海的紀念日」</h3>
<p>大東亞戰爭係以廣大的太平洋爲舞台的海之戰爭。在這廣漠的海面上，協助海軍而縱橫活躍的商船隊，運輸船隊，確非常辛勞，而同時這些海員的活動，實又爲戰爭勝利的一環。爲感謝這些海員，並爲普及國民對海洋的認識以進出海外，以此目的，乃有「海的紀念日」之規定。</p>

<h3>新聞聯合會　提倡節約運動</h3>
<p>上海新聞聯合會，因鑒於近代戰時國家，莫不以節約特資爲求得最後勝利之要圖，而國府自與友故協力向英美宣戰以還。對節約運動，雖曾經各方竭力提倡，然未獲得預期之效果。且以上海一埠，物資浪費猶鉅，奢侈靡費之風特盛，不特影響戰時物力，抑亦刺激物價高昂，小市民生活艱苦難言，故特發起提倡節約運動，以增强戰力，而糾正社會人心。爰經該會，　具節約運動推進實施具節方案，由新聞界以輿論立塲發動鼓吹，使市民普遍實踐，並向當局建議，俾使領導推進。其要綱約分提倡穿着舊衣·布衣·短衣運動，不宴客，不喝酒，不作大規模娛樂。婚喪喜慶探用茶點等項，以養成節約風氣，而完成節約目的。決定自七月十五日起，至七月三十一日止爲擴大宣傳週。聞該會或將　請本市各關係當局，有力團體合作，協力推進節約運動，及定期舉行節約運動。公開演講大會，敦請社會名流輸流演講。</p>

<p>體育</p>
<h3>華通盃慈善足球賽　聯誼定期戰聖葡聯　本星期六在徐匯展幕</h3>
<p>本市華通體育會主辦之華通盃慈善足球賽，邀請滬華人新盟主聯誼會，對抗西人鐵軍聖葡聯，首塲已訂本星期六（十七日）在徐家匯中學球塲揭幕。第二塲則於下星期三（廿一日）在徐匯賽總交綏。由華通體育會會長蔣益門捐助獎品。門票收入入撥充難童敎養院經費。査聯誼隊自去年重整旗鼓後。邀得港名將李天生，宋錄聖，劉顯漢，鄭英權，李義臣，瞿永福等來滬，加以在滬首流人材孫錦順，張林根，吳祺祥，高保正，費春華等組成極堅强之陣營。嗣後參加西聯會甲組以十一戰七勝四和之戰績，獨佔鰲頭，且該隊近在華北賬災足球賽中，竟能壓倒戰軍東華會，儼然有華人新盟主之慨，聲勢雄壯，氣燄万丈。聖葡聯集聖芳濟與葡商會兩隊之精銳，麾下戰將如雲。若滬埠際代表維克泰，福恩二員虎將，固已膾灸人口。而許而茲，奧列維拉，蓋恩，卡洛列區，V蘇若，W瀋脫遜豐　屬上駟之材。戰門力之堅强。不言而喻。前週靜安保甲足球義賽在跑馬廳舉行時，該隊竟以四對三力克裏聯隊，當時表演之精彩，萬餘球迷，均吧觀止，此次與璐誼隊對壨，不啻爭取滬上足球王座，屆時中西兩路雄師大決戰，定有一番空前劇烈之門爭，而勝利誰屬，殊未可預卜，爲避免陽光逼人起見，比賽一律於下午六時半開始。</p>
<p>昨日發報時間七點十分</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>建部着手增加糧產</h3>
<p>本月九日中央社東京電稱，國府建設部長兼全國經濟委員會秘書長陳君　氏　近在東京帝國飯店招待記者團，發表談話略謂：「建設部前於本年二月爲適應新事態起見，曾以發展經濟安定民生爲最高目標，改組並擴充過去之交通部及水利委員會。復爲發展該二機關之事業起見，乃決定建設三年計劃，竭力求其實施。建設三年計劃爲着重於農田水利之開發，目前先着手開盟東太湖，已派遣技術團前往工作，一俟實地調查完畢，即行着手開懇，預計東太湖開懇計劃完成後可得很田一萬六千公頃，可收食米七千萬担。至於其他長江池沼地帶之開發，亦已着手計劃，決　速促其實現。」</p>
<p>同日該社蘇州電稱：「蘇建廳爲改善水利計劃，近特組織東太湖商量壨隊出發測勘，…建設部…對太湖水利問題並…指派簡任專員蔡復初，水利署技正王家璋陶家憲，聯合日方水利專家安藝皎一等組織東太湖水利顧家團，於日前由京出發前來東太湖流域及瀸山湖週圍視察。及徵集一般有關水利之材料。該團視察地區計有蘇州上海吳江嘉興松江靑浦常熟等地，必要時並得察勘沿太湖重要鎭區，視察期間爲二十餘天。」</p>
<p>吾人細詰上述二電，覺得政府已下決心，實行改良水利，增加糧產，以安民生，不再如過去之「坐言而不起行」或「靁聲大雨點小」了。東太湖區每年七千萬担食米增產計劃果能實現，則東南民食問題立可解決，其有助於大東亞戰爭之圓滿結束者，必非淺鮮。</p>
<h3>爲抑平物價　澈查非法囤積</h3>
<p>爲澈查上　中外商民非法囤積大量主要物資起見，設立物資調查委員會後，竭力防止囤積，以資　平物價，而安民生，同時，錢業各行荘對於主要物資停止承受抵押，關於主要商品（包括原料及製品）之存貯，買賣，製造，均須依法登記，由利害關係人各別辦理之：（一）所有人，（二）倉庫業者或受托人，（三）質權人，（四）保險人，（五）運送人。其申請人爲同業公會會員者，應由各該同業公會彙轉，計：（一）商品之種類及名稱，（二）商品之數量，（三）商品之來源及其取得之時期與價値，（四）包裝之方式，（五）堆存之地點，（六）商品所有權人之牌號，在地及負責人之姓名，住址，（七）申請人之牌號，營業所在地及負責人之姓名及住址，（八）塡報年月日。由主管機關依照呈報之主要商品，實施檢查倉庫及公司行號主要商品之存貨，凡非同業公會會員，以營利爲目的囤積主要商品者，或對非同業公會會員賣出主要商品，而明知其不爲直接消費者，以及對於所存主要商品匿不登記呈報者，違者其商品不問屬於犯人與否，均須沒收之，並依治罪條例處罰。其操縱市價擾亂市塲者，處重刑。</p>
<p>昨據日文報載稱，公共租界工部局因鑒於黑市物價昂騰，爲澈底彈壓奸商起見，除前曾發表聲明外，並將從事於主要商品，而從事於棉紗布之投機商人，將更予嚴厲之檢查</p>
<h3>財部令調整　滬金融機關</h3>
<p>關於財政部整理滬市各金融機關問題，前曾有將予以合併之傳說，旋經財政部公佈修正銀行注册章程及信託公司登記暫行條例，始明晰財部當局對整理滬市各小銀行錢荘決定不用强制合併方法，而使北增加資本金額，藉以鞏固金融機關基礎，茲悉本市銀錢兩業公會已奉到財政部命令，即日起根據新規定法令轉飭各行荘，限於六個月內增加資本，（一）銀行錢荘（即股份有限公司組織者）資本最少增至六百萬元，實收足額爲三百萬元。（二）普通商業銀行兼營信託業務者，資本金額最少五百萬元，（內三百萬元爲銀行資金，二百萬元爲信託部資金）如逾六個月限期滿後，不予增加資本，未符合法令規定者，即予勒令合併或予停業，聞各行荘奉令後，現正積極準備召集股東臨時會議決定增資辦法</p>
<h3>小麥收買順利　粉廠開工</h3>
<p>粉麥專賣會鑒於各地小麥業已登塲，爲實施統一收買集中配給，以維民食起見，依照商統會所定之「小麥收買方案」，由各麺粉廠委託商販質商業中地麥行，先向該　員會辦理登記，依照規定價格以及區域統一收買。頃上海·蘇州·無錫·安慶·南通·杭州·揚州·蚌埠·蕪湖等均已設立分支辦事處，並經中交等行予以十萬萬元之鉅額貸款，所以收買小麥工作，在各方通力合作之下，進行甚密順利，况今年小麥適値薄收之年，各地產額較去年增加平均約三成，尤以江北以及蚌埠徐州一帶爲最豐。記者頃向關係方面探悉，各地小麥產額估計總共約二千萬担。（一）京滬綫蘇州一百萬擔，無錫二百萬擔，常州一百萬擔，鎭江一百萬擔，南京五十萬擔，安亭五十萬擔，崑山六十萬擔，丹陽六十萬擔，太倉五十萬擔，嘉定三十萬擔。（二）江北綫揚州二百七十萬擔，高郵三百萬擔，泰州一百五十萬擔，興化三十萬擔，其他各縣三百萬擔。（三）蕪湖一百五十萬擔。（四）津浦綫一百萬擔。惟今年各地實際收獲，聞江北及津浦綫各地。或可超過估計數量，聞華中各地如上海無錫鎭江各地麺粉廠以小麥已上市，業已先後烣復開車，製造麺粉，供給各地民食所。</p>
<h3>華股趨勢</h3>
<p>昨華股騰漲加厲，晨開後胃戶絕跡，價見狂跳，直至十一點二十分後，爲見高求現之專戶所迫，終於正午重轉堅挺，百貨業站領導地位。永安突出大關，新新國貨亦在有求無供狀况中，內衣亦出關口，景綸彩襪躍升加速，連衝兩關，景福隨升亦動，公用業之閘北水電及華商電氣一味升騰，前者再出關外，南洋烟公司挺站四關，大中業火柴上升亦屬意外，紡織業之永安紡織漲度已緩，信和·榮豐節節步昂，新豐印染·大中華織造堅定逾恒，文化業中華興世界均飛出關外，與商務上升均勁，新藥業上漲仍多盤，新亞·中法·信誼·王洲等一致軋升，民誼·中西·明星香水，穩中帶堅，華豐搪瓷成交價高出意外，</p>

<h3>簡訊</h3>
<p>證券大樓六一三號華股日報出版逾年，提倡華股事業，介紹工商內容，素以翔實著稱，爲工商界與投資者之重要參考資料，以故銷路日廣。該報近來，益求精進，自本月份起特闢中國工商金融企業界名人特寫，專以介紹創辦事業成功歷史，提供一般觀摩仿效，其內容均派員親自訪問調查，故極爲眞實，此種創舉不但爲該報增色，且爲全國企業界放一異彩云。</p>

<h3>日本經濟使節團蒞華觀感</h3>
<p>中日交允民間經濟使節團於七日來滬後，勾留歷時四日，先後與陸海軍當局，大使館事務所田尻大使，陳市長，及中日關係當局，商統會，銀行公會，錢業公會，上海工商聯誼會，東亞經濟懇談會，華中本部等各權威人士懇談，業已公畢，於十二日上午九時乘車赴京，預定拜會汪主席，周財長，梅實長，站在日本民間經濟人之立塲，就新政策實踐後之經濟上問題，交換意見，係使節團，在滬時間雖短，但對於促進中日經濟提携，已有偉大成功。</p>

<h3>國府財政收支平衡</h3>
<p>國民政府還都後，對於財政收支情况，頗爲人民所關心。本報記者頃晤熟悉財政界情形之某君，據告國民財政收支始終平衡，三年來不僅無一文赤字預算，且有積蓄，從未向中央儲備銀行透支。友邦亦當以財政健全相推許。此外，關於中央儲備銀行監督發行業務一點，該行設有參事會，聘請銀錢業鉅子爲參事，發行數額，對該會均有報告云。</p>

<p>一個朋友寫信來，說他錯過了三年前的「機會」，那時他有過多的空閒，儘可用在一種外國文的研究上，到現在一定有了成績，祇少已經打下了基礎，不致像目前這般。</p>
<p>機會，往往在錯過之後，纔被發覺，這是常事。要是在事先就能把握住非常機會的樞紐，利用千鈞一髪的時機，旋轉乾坤，這決非一個常才。然面，握住了一個個平凡的機緣，不放棄一時一刻，用不着抱一鳴驚人的幻想，祇是老老實實的脚踏實地按步就麗做去，常人也有着他的成功。</p>
<p>在今日痛感錯過了昨日的機會，單是痛感是沒有用處的。痛感之外，加以嗟歏，懊喪，自愧，自責，也是沒有用處的。若不從今日努力，不難於明白重現今日樣的悲傷情緒！</p>
<p>機會是從來不等待人的，無能的人才去等待機會，勇敢的人會創造機會。</p>
<p>在每一聲時鐘的滴答裏，莫不放置着改變人類命運的機會，祇有及時努力者會趕上去把捉住他，懶惰者却連牠的影踪也沒有發見！</p>
<h3>安步當車</h3>
<p>— 勵志</p>
<p>日子一天長似一天，天氣也一天暖似一天，爲了不願受電車上那種不顧命的挨擠，所以我每天總是安步當車的走到辦公室，走囘家去。</p>
<p>我走路的時候，眼睛平視遠處，身體竭力保持平衡，口裏輕輕的哼着一支進行曲，我的脚步就依着這拍子走去，不疾不徐，從菜市路康悌路走到外灘，絲毫不覺得氣喘，一面走，一面計劃着我的工作日程：早晨到公司裏去時，我規定今天該辦的公事，應怎樣辦？那一件先辦？那一件後辦？晚上囘家去的時候，我同樣規定我晚上的工作，應讀些什麽書？應寫些什麽東西？等等，等到我的計劃規定完畢，離目的地已不遠，使我無暇想到步行的疲勞。</p>
<p>這樣，我得到了下面許多好處：</p>
<p>一、支出項下，少了一筆車費、</p>
<p>二、腿部肌肉結實了許多、</p>
<p>三、養成早起和一醒就起的習慣，日裏做事淸醒敏捷、</p>
<p>四、工作效率增加，生活變動更嚴勵更明朗、</p>
<p>五、精神安適，晚上無夢。</p>
<h3>得道者多助</h3>
<p>— 王益塵</p>
<p>孩子們給了我一張入塲券，一定要我去參加　　學校裏所開的懇親會。我因爲這天本是　假，又却不渦孩子們的拖拉，所以便到我我久想去看看的眾英中小學，地點是在過馬路六六八弄。我去了二次，上午去看成　展覽，下午去看遊藝，孩子們都很滿意，我也很滿意。</p>
<p>各敎室都粉刷一新，所有的課桌和課卷，不但佈置得井井有條，並且竟有別出民裁的新花樣，自課卷中所表現出來的政績，我不能不老實說一聲。比了相近其他各學校，不知要高出多少。</p>
<p>遊藝節目是在校園中舉行的。居然搭了臺，擺了二三百張凳子，容納了五六百個人，所有的節目，都是學生自己　任的，雖然也不外乎各種歌舞與　劇，但他們所表演的，確也優美高尚，兼而有之，不同於流俗。</p>
<p>我看了這許多情形，心裏不免有告懷疑，這學校不過辦了一年，爲什麽會有這　的成績？難道校長是個大富翁，經費充足，所以各事易辦麽？我順便就去拜訪了方校長一下，不料方校長所囘答我的，却大出我的意料之外。</p>
<p>方校長　　自己沒有錢，　有一些錢，早在開辦時用完了，這學期虧空的不得了，寧而社會上有一偏聽偏信賢明的人士，例如馬蔭良·陸高　夏查芳·潘仰堯·王完白·嚴雁憲·周性初等，聽見了這消息，就自動捐款了許多錢，非出彌補了本學期的虧空，也擔負了將來的不足。其中大多數並且就任校董，奠下了該校的永久基礎。…至於爲什麽別人肯這樣幫忙，方校長說，就因爲她的確是爲敎育而辦學校的，一年來已博得了社會上一般人士的信任。她絕對不想將學校當作私座，當作發財或　多的工作。</p>
<p>哦，原來方校長是完全靠着別人的幫助的，我不禁想起了「得道者多助」這句話來。因此，我相信，凡是一件事業，只要動機純正，辦理努力，沒有不發達的。我將以上的情形寫出來，就是給一般有志於創辦事業者，作一個借鑑。（　移助學）</p>
<h3>鷄</h3>
<p>— 沈沈</p>
<p>停了片刻，又說：「你去告訴姓李的，叫他識相些，不然今天晚上他休想安安穩穩的睏覺！」×司令催着張參謀去料理，並用恫嚇口氣，警告李鎭長。張參謀確實有些左右爲難，去罷，李鎭長那邊剛才已經把話說盡了。不去罷，×司令又不肯輕易放過的。况且他想我是本鄕人，也許將來還要見見鄰里父老的面，怎麽可以過分的幫兇脅迫呢？×司令也不過憑着幾根槍桿子，作蘗的事，已經做得夠了。總有一天，强盜逼見賊爺爺的。我這盌飯，終究難吃下去的。過去我爲他也夠盡忠了，這回我準備碰釘子。充其量回老家拾荒去，替人趕魚，自己一點得不到什麽，眞不値得。張參謀愈想愈怨，按捺不住了，就說道：</p>
<p>「司令！我實在沒有法子再向他們說長說短，就是說，也不中用了。你要怎麽樣，就怎麽樣。我來了幾個月，來時一身短衫褲，準備去時也一身短衫褲的，當初你答應我如何如何，一個月進益有多少，到今天只看見你鈔票搬進搬出。我不幹了，明天回家去了！」張參謀一口氣說着，站起身來，面孔漲得通紅，揑緊拳頭，往外就走，經過×司令身邊時，×司令忽然和顏悅色地伸手拍拍張參謀的肩膀，往裏一推，說道：</p>
<p>「啊唷，老張！怎麽啦，爲了這點事，你就生氣了嗎？坐下來，我們再商量商量！」×司令勸住張參謀坐下，張坐着低頭不作聲，×司令想着張來了幾個月，的確爲我趕了許多魚，而他沒有　着分文，一時似乎有點不安，張還能提筆寫幾個字，在我這裏很得用，眼前倒是少不了他的。×司令在這種觀念之下，就很各氣地對張參謀繼續說道：</p>
<p>「老張！你不要生氣，也不要着急，我肚子裏明白的，我們當然有福同享。這裏我先送你三百元錢，零用零用。」說着一邊傳播向褲袋裏換出一捲鈔票，檢取三搭，塞到張參謀手裏，反而把剛才的事不提起了。張參謀半推半就的，把鈔票放在桌子上，依然低着頭不做聲。×司令似乎很馴善的伸手拍着張的肩膀，說道：</p>
<p>「老張！我們自己兄弟，犯不着生氣的，那個人的事，你快去隨便了結吧！我不管了！」說完話站起身來，把桌上的鈔票塞進第口袋裏，扶起張的身子，推他往外走，表示分外的親暱。（九）</p>

<h3>Further Discussion on Unifying and Promoting Charitable Undertakings</h3>
<p>We, having observed the increasing number of refugees and orphaned children in Shanghai in recent years, coupled with the escalating cost of living, despite the hundreds of charitable organizations working to accommodate them, still find the effort falling short. Therefore, considering the urgent need for unified advancement of charitable undertakings, we must focus on a proactive approach, developing with planned organization, and eliminating the serious phenomena in society as soon as possible. On June 26th, we published an essay, proposing the idea of "Unifying and Promoting Charitable Undertakings," hoping that social leaders would come forward to advocate for it. Subsequently, Mr. Kai Lan, Mr. Lin Kanghou, and Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Chairman and Vice Chairmen of the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association, respectively, expressed their thoughts. (The full text was published on pages three of this newspaper from July 6th to 8th.) Given the enthusiasm these three gentlemen have always shown for public welfare and charitable endeavors, and their high reputations in all sectors of society, such outstanding opinions will certainly arouse public attention and promote the sound development of charitable undertakings. We look forward to the early realization of this endeavor, our eagerness no less than that of the three gentlemen. As the Shanghai concessions are about to be returned and Shanghai is about to be reborn, we especially hope that all sectors will work together to jointly promote the sound development of Shanghai society. The agreed promotion of charitable undertakings should also be considered a critical aspect.</p>
<p>We have heard that the issues raised by Mr. Lin, Mr. Yuan, and Mr. Deng regarding unifying and promoting charitable undertakings could only be voiced by those deeply familiar with its joys and hardships. The content is truly worthy of thorough investigation. However, we believe that, firstly, with regard to unified promotion, it should be handled as a whole. Unification cannot be separate from promotion; rather promotion cannot be apart from unification. The important goal is that the promotion of charitable undertakings in Shanghai must have a unified plan and steps. Secondly, regarding the question of who should unify, we partly agree with the views of the three gentlemen. They believe that it is better for charitable organizations to automatically unify and promote than for the government or officials to unify it alone. This is not to say that official unification is not good, but in terms of the current actual situation, whether in terms of the scale, equipment, achievements, or talent of various undertakings, it is not easy for the officials to unify. We advocate that government agencies should lead and promote unification first, and then various charitable organizations should automatically unify and promote afterward. As for the third point, how to unify and promote, this includes organizational issues, talent issues, investigation, research, design, and funding issues. We deeply feel that the concerns of the three gentlemen are pertinent and worthy of arousing attention and research from all parties.</p>
<p>We have heard that after raising the issues, Mr. Lin, Mr. Yuan, and Mr. Deng listed the difficulties in unifying and promoting charitable undertakings, and finally expressed their ideals and practical ways to overcome the difficulties. In addition to our sincere sympathy, we would like to offer another word for correction from the three gentlemen and all those concerned about the future of charitable undertakings in this city. From the organizational aspect of unifying and promoting charitable undertakings, we believe that if there are indeed leading organizations among the current charitable organizations, there is no need to start from scratch. It is enough to reorganize and refresh them. However, what must be achieved is, first, that this organization must have a reputation in society, and its work and undertakings must be believed by various charitable organizations and society; second, this organization must absorb experienced talents who have done well in charitable undertakings in the past or are still doing so to participate in design and promotion work, and must be currently earnestly engaged in charitable undertakings; third, all the work of this organization must be open to the public, and respected gentlemen in society should organize an inspection body to review its work from time to time, and accept public criticism and so as to strengthen its work efficiency. We still feel today that the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association is well-suited to preside over the unified promotion of the undertaking because it has almost all of the above conditions. They seem to have already done a lot of organizational work. However, in the past, the scope of the association's work seemed to be limited to relief for the poor and sick. In fact, charitable undertakings are by no means limited to these two, and perhaps the nature of the association's subsidies to various organizations is not limited to these two either. If it is reorganized and expanded in the future, the scope of work will naturally be expanded to include all charitable undertakings.</p>
<p>Regarding the unified promotion of charitable undertakings, in addition to organization, the most important thing is the issue of funding. The failure of hundreds of charitable organizations in this city to fully achieve their goals is due to the lack of funds. And the biggest difficulty for various charitable organizations is also the lack of funds, as far as we know. We have heard that Mr. Lin, Mr. Yuan, and Mr. Deng have proposed organized fundraising methods that are detailed and comprehensive. What we want to add is: in terms of income, there must be planned and organized, total mobilization-style fundraising; in addition to passive relief, such as relief for the old, sick, disabled, we must especially strive for active relief, cooperate with relevant government departments and financial entrepreneurs, and open short-term handicraft, agricultural reclamation, animal husbandry, and other training classes for the unemployed vagrants, the extremely poor men and women, and young beggars, refugees, etc. After a considerable period of training, they will be sent to various appropriate production departments to engage in production work, and when necessary, they can run their own production business without relying entirely on donations. In terms of expenditure, the word "economy" has almost reached the point where every charitable organization has no more to save. However, if unified planning and management can be carried out in planning and management, and rationalized methods can be implemented, perhaps the severity of the funding problem can be alleviated. Secondly, regarding the design issue, on the one hand, concentrate the real talents in the original charitable organizations. On the other hand, select experts from enthusiastic people in the society, and supplement them with personnel selected by relevant government departments and technical talents hired from friendly countries to form an "Advisory Committee" (hypothetical name) to divide the work and cooperate to plan, improve, and promote charitable undertakings. We believe that with the cooperation of all parties, the future charitable undertakings will be able to achieve the due effect. We have heard that the ideal of Mr. Lin, Mr. Yuan, and Mr. Deng is not difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>The unified promotion of charitable undertakings is a basic undertaking for transforming society, and it is also a prerequisite for helping to stabilize today's Shanghai society. We hope that the charitable organizations and people from all walks of life in this city will, following the lead of Mr. Lin, Mr. Yuan, and Mr. Deng, express their insightful views and work together to promote its early realization.</p>

<h3>Inspection of the South Completed Successfully - Prime Minister Tojo Returns Safely to Tokyo - Total Duration of Thirteen Days - Politically Significant</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 3:15 PM on the 12th that Prime Minister and Army Minister Tojo Hideki had completed his visit to Thailand and inspection of various military and political locations in the South, and returned to Tokyo at 3:15 PM on the 12th.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister and Army Minister Tojo Hideki, accompanied by Army Ministry's Director of Military Affairs Sato, Vice Minister of the Greater East Asia Ministry Yamamoto, Director of Political Affairs Bureau of the Foreign Ministry Uemura, Colonel Yai, Lieutenant Colonel Takahashi, and other staff members, departed from Tokyo on June 30th for the South. He traveled to the front lines of various military and political locations in Vietnam, Thailand, Malaya, Sumatra, Borneo, Java, the Philippines, etc. He held discussions with local government leaders and military, political, and civilian officials in the South, commended their hard work, and inspected the conditions of the Southern residents who were cooperating in the construction of Greater East Asia. He achieved significant results. Having completed his mission, he returned to Tokyo on the afternoon of the 12th, totaling thirteen days.</p>
<p>During his trip to the South, Prime Minister Tojo and his party first made a brief stop in Saigon, Vietnam, on the 3rd to listen to reports on the military situation in Vietnam from the top commanders of the Japanese Army and Navy stationed there. He then traveled to Bangkok, Thailand, where he stayed for two nights. On the 4th, he met with Thai Prime Minister Phibun Songkhram to discuss the collaborative war strategies of Japan and Thailand. The two sides were in complete agreement and subsequently issued a joint statement, confirming that the six British-administered states would be incorporated into Thai territory. On the 5th, he proceeded to Syonan (Singapore) to meet with Field Marshal Terauchi, the Supreme Commander of the Southern Army, to hear reports on the military and political situation, and to comfort the soldiers in the South. He also held discussions with Subhas Chandra Bose, President of the Indian Independence League, and Ba Maw, Chief of the Burmese Executive Administration, and inspected the Indian National Army, offering them encouragement. On the 6th, he inspected the military and political situation in Sumatra, Java, and Borneo, and attended a residents' appreciation meeting in Jakarta. On his return journey, he revisited the Philippines, where he met with Philippine Executive Secretary Vargas, Independent Preparation Committee Chairman Laurel, and other officials, inspected the officials and civilians active in various places under military administration, and gave separate instructions and encouragement. After thirteen days, he has now completed the entire trip and returned home. Prime Minister Tojo's inspection of the South has had a significant impact on completing the Greater East Asia War, uniting the Greater East Asia nations, and promoting the construction of Greater East Asia. Therefore, its political significance is extremely important. Furthermore, according to opinions from political circles here, it is believed that since Prime Minister Tojo had previously visited China, Manchuria, and the Philippines, and has now inspected the South, he has practically traveled throughout Greater East Asia. This will not only enable the countries and peoples of Greater East Asia to deepen their understanding of Japan's policies and sincerity, but Prime Minister Tojo will also be strengthened by his personal experiences to fulfill his determination and conviction to complete the war and complete the construction. It can be truly said that the construction of Greater East Asia will unfold with even greater leaps.</p>
<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Releases Impressions of the Trip After Returning Home</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - After returning home, Japanese Prime Minister and Army Minister Tojo Hideki immediately issued a statement outlining his impressions of the trip. The gist of his statement is as follows: I was honored to visit Thailand on this occasion, where I had sincere discussions with Prime Minister Phibun and other Thai leaders, and was able to witness the reality of Thailand under the Greater East Asia War. I express my deep respect for the continuous efforts made by the Thai people, united under the leadership of Prime Minister Phibun, to promote Thailand and to thoroughly pursue the Greater East Asia War. I firmly believe that the people of Japan and Thailand will deepen their understanding of each other through my visit to Thailand, and further strengthen their determination to pursue the war. In particular, the views of the Prime Ministers of Japan and Thailand have been completely aligned regarding the new concrete cooperative measures that Japan will take towards Thailand. This is truly gratifying. During my visit to Thailand, I also visited Malaya, Sumatra, and Borneo, inspected the military situation and the real situation of the residents in various places, and was greatly pleased to console the Japanese officers and soldiers and officials and civilians stationed there. In Syonan, in addition to holding talks with Burmese Chief Executive Ba Maw and Indian Independence leader Subhas Chandra Bose, I also had the opportunity to inspect the Indian National Army. Later, in Jakarta, I attended a grand appreciation meeting held by local residents, and when I passed through Manila, I was able to hold talks with members of the Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee, which was also very pleasant. Since the occupation of the South, although it has only been a year and a half, it is gratifying that the implementation of extreme policies such as military, economic and cultural development with the sincere cooperation of the indigenous people is proceeding smoothly. I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the cooperation of the indigenous people. Moreover, the independence preparations in Burma and the Philippines are progressing steadily, and the participation of Indonesian people in politics is also about to be realized concretely. On the one hand, the Indian independence preparation movement is becoming stronger day by day, and the day when India gains freedom and prosperity is not far away, which is especially commendable. For many years, the South has been under the control of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands, and has been regarded as an object of exploitation. As colonies, the Southern people were unable to receive education and were bound, leading a life of ignorance and indifference. At this time, the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War was truly a gift from heaven. Now, the people of both sides have broken away from the shackles of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands, and have taken on the original mission of the Greater East Asia nations, and are preparing for the situation of coexistence and co-prosperity in Greater East Asia. Since March of this year, I have visited the Republic of China, Manchuria, and the Philippines. This time, I have visited Thailand and various parts of the South, and the impressions I have gained are very good, which makes me more determined in my belief that the construction of Greater East Asia will be successful. Japan, with this belief in sure victory and success, is determined to move forward towards the path of destroying the aggressors of East Asia. Java occupies an extremely important position in this Greater East Asia War. Therefore, you have a significant impact on the future of the war situation. I previously stated specifically in the Japanese Parliament that the indigenous people of Java would be granted the right to participate in politics this year. I hope that you will demonstrate your great spirit, and under the command of the local army, work together to engage in construction in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture, in order to complete the Greater East Asia War. To achieve this consensus, work hard and strive. I have expressed my thoughts here, and I pray that you will strive to fulfill them.</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Tojo Visits the Philippines Again, Holds Discussions with Military and Political Leaders</h3>
<p>Manila, 12th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Tojo Hideki arrived in Manila at noon on the 10th, accompanied by Vice Minister Yamamoto of the Greater East Asia Ministry, Director Sato of the Military Affairs Bureau, Director Uemura of the Political Affairs Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, and other staff members. Supreme Commander Kuroda, Supreme Advisor Murata, and the staff of the Military and Political Administration, the Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee, and the heads of the Executive Administration greeted him. Amidst the cheers of the citizens lining the streets, he proceeded to the Manila Hotel for rest.</p>
<p>Manila, 12th (Central News Agency) - After arriving in the Philippines, Prime Minister Tojo held discussions with Supreme Commander Kuroda and members of the Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee, which have yielded epoch-making results. On the morning of the 11th, he embarked on his journey home, escorted by many officials including the chiefs of staff of the Japanese Army and Navy and the heads of the Executive Administration.</p>
<p>Manila, 12th (Central News Agency) - At 4 PM on the 10th, Prime Minister Tojo held a 40-minute discussion with the members of the Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee at the Manila Hotel, and hosted a tea party for the members. Chairman Laurel and Member Roxas, who were undergoing treatment, also attended despite their illness. During the event, Prime Minister Tojo and Chairman Laurel delivered speeches successively, and then exchanged views on various matters related to Philippine independence in all sincerity. The gist of Prime Minister Tojo's speech and Chairman Laurel's response is as follows: "Gist of Prime Minister Tojo's Speech": I am extremely pleased with the establishment of the Preparatory Committee and the active progress of various preparatory matters. I hope that all members will make sincere efforts to quickly complete the preparatory work, and I hope that all the people of the Philippines will work together to build a new Philippines and fulfill the Greater East Asia War. "Gist of Chairman Laurel's Response": The members of the Philippine Independence Committee were all selected from the sincere people in all sectors of the Philippines, so I am confident that they will achieve their desired goals. I sincerely appreciate the fact that the Philippines will gain independence. This sentiment of mine not only represents the sentiment of the 18 million people of the Philippines, but is also commonly felt by all East Asian nations liberated from the shackles of the United Kingdom and the United States. What the people of the Philippines should think about is the joyful feeling when the flag of an independent nation flies in the air, which cannot be described in words. Therefore, we will mobilize the power of all the people of the Philippines to move forward in the construction of the new Philippines, and we are determined to make the greatest efforts to complete the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Attends Mass Rally in Java, Encourages Unity and Efforts in Construction</h3>
<p>Jakarta, 12th (Central News Agency) - During his inspection of the South, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo arrived here at 11:50 AM on the 7th. Commander-in-Chief Harada and other military and civilian representatives greeted him warmly. After a brief rest at the residence of the Commander-in-Chief, Prime Minister Tojo listened to a report on the military situation from Commander-in-Chief Harada at noon and held various discussions.</p>
<p>Jakarta, 12th (Central News Agency) - At 4:30 PM on the 7th, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo attended a mass appreciation meeting held at Kanpir Square here. He addressed the more than 100,000 participants sincerely, saying in essence: I am delighted to meet with you all today. Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, you have understood the true meaning of this operation and have cooperated with Japan with solid unity and sincerity. I am deeply grateful for your involvement in the construction of the new Java. I am even more deeply moved by what I have seen today. All the residents of the various regions of our Greater East Asia are one large family of one system, but they have been oppressed by the United Kingdom and the United States for many years. Since the start of the war, Japan has become the central core of Greater East Asia with the posture of certain victory in Greater East Asia, in order to liberate this large family from the shackles of East Asian invaders, and this war has occurred. I have visited various places in China and Manchuria, and this time I have come to inspect various places in the South. The impressions I have gained are very good, which makes me even more determined in my belief that the construction of Greater East Asia will be successful. With this belief in sure victory and success, Japan is determined to move forward towards the path of destroying the aggressors of East Asia. Java occupies an extremely important position in this Greater East Asia War. Therefore, you have a significant impact on the future of the war situation. I previously stated specifically in the Japanese Parliament that the original residents of Java will be granted the right to participate in politics this year, which is I hope that you will demonstrate your great spirit, and under the command of the local army, work together to engage in construction in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture. In order to complete the Greater East Asia War, to achieve this consensus, work hard and strive. I have expressed my thoughts here, and I pray that you will strive to fulfill them</p>
<h3>US Air Force Stationed in Chongqing Bombs Vietnam Twice</h3>
<p>Hanoi, 11th (Central News Agency) - The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing bombed the Tokyo State of Vietnam on the morning of the 10th. In the afternoon, it attacked Haiphong and Honggu again. Both were bombed. A total of 21 residents died and 40 were injured in the two raids, it is said.</p>
<h3>Wartime German Student Life</h3>
<p>Germany's total war effort and national mobilization have recently been completed. Not only middle school and girls' school students, but also elementary school students, want to show their skills in this era of total war. The following describes the recent daily life of German youths aged six to seventeen, also known as "Young German Nationals," and their participation in the total war effort:</p>
<p>Thorough Air Raid Defense Education</p>
<p>First-graders aged six and seven used to be escorted to and from school by their mothers. However, in today's total war, many mothers in families go to work in military factories and have no time to care for their children. Therefore, the children automatically form groups of three or four and go to school.</p>
<p>National schools continue as before, with five hours of daily instruction starting at 8:00 AM. However, if there is an air raid alarm on alternate evenings, class time is delayed by two hours. Most of the young teachers have gone to the front lines, so most of the teachers are female or elderly. They liaise with the National Socialist Party's youth organization to improve education under strategic conditions. Air raid defense education facilities are also very thorough, and exercises are held from time to time. Sandbags, fire extinguishers, etc., must be placed in each classroom and corridor, and the basement is equipped with sleeping quarters that are absolutely safe for sleep. There are all kinds of tableware and ventilation equipment, and nurses are on standby, sweeping and cleaning, so that children separated from their fathers and brothers will not be anxious.</p>
<p>Training in Emergency Measures</p>
<p>The implementation of wartime children's education is extremely practical. New slogans are often placed in classrooms and corridors. The themes often come from German history, portraits of legends, or maxims, so that children have a deep impression. Every day, the children collect many waste products from their homes, such as paper, torn rags, and scrap metal, and send them to the teachers. Why do they desperately collect so many waste products? Why does the country need this? What can be done with these in the future? Large color illustrations or movies are used to explain this, deeply and clearly imprinting it in the children's minds. Slightly more advanced children are taught practical knowledge such as first aid measures for injuries. "Injured person models" are wrapped with cellophane threads, and actual performances are given on hands or feet. Regarding these matters, party organizations issue magazines and pamphlets with instructions to the teachers, who then teach the children the important things that need to be especially remembered during wartime.</p>
<p>Children's Health and Satisfaction</p>
<p>Naturally, great attention is also paid to children's health. Children's health is no different from pre-war in any national school. For children aged six to fourteen, the German National Socialist Party specially organizes "Forest Schools." Children who apply to join are sent to safe conservation areas where there is absolutely no danger of surprise attacks, such as coastal areas. During the summer holidays, they take in good nutrition together with the teachers.</p>
<p>In addition to their regular lessons, the children must also help nearby farmers, such as removing pests, drawing water, and caring for livestock, which are things that children can do. Children's health is closely monitored at all times. Experts often visit and ask questions in each forest school dormitory: "Is the food nutritious enough?" "What is the sanitary condition?" Therefore, there is even a lamp-lighting workshop for the leaders of the children to study, and currently there are 6,393 male instructors and 3,767 female instructors in training.</p>
<p>In addition, there are 248 male instructors and 274 female instructors who specialize in teaching children how to repair furniture in homes damaged by surprise attacks. Since the autumn of 1940, a total of 382,616 boys and girls have been transported from areas with the most surprise attacks to the German inland, which is free from surprise attacks, or to conservation areas in Denmark, Norway, Hungary, Slovakia, and Bulgaria, using 1,621 special trains and 58 ships.</p>
<p>Senior Students Practice Air Defense</p>
<p>The wartime life of secondary school students is similar to that of pre-war students, with senior students receiving six hours of instruction daily. However, the highest-level 17-year-old boys must be conscripted into the "Hitler Youth Air Defense Force." This youth air defense force returns to school from the barracks one day a week and attends classes for four hours each day. Those who do not have enough time due to this conscription will omit unnecessary courses to supplement it. For example, French, French, music, gymnastics, and other subjects are canceled, and only English is limited in terms of language.</p>
<p>In this way, when the highest-level students in boys' secondary schools finish their last year, they are also graduated from the "Hitler Youth Air Defense Force" and are immediately conscripted into formal soldiers. Therefore, there has been a great decrease in the number of people who have advanced to senior high schools or above recently, and only those in special engineering and medical fields can enter senior high schools. This is the Ministry of Education's unavoidable policy under the total war effort. The highest-level boys can choose either the "Hitler Youth Air Defense Force" or the "Hitler Youth Volunteer Force." The "Hitler Youth Volunteer Force" system was established in 1942. In addition to receiving various technical education before becoming soldiers, they are also taught skills such as car drivers, flight telegraph operators, communicators, and sailors. To date, thousands of people have been concentrated here for education.</p>
<p>Service During the Busy Farming Season</p>
<p>Students other than senior students in boys' secondary schools must fully serve in the harvest during the busy farming season from July 7th, and girls help with farming operations and housework. However, during the school term, they cooperate with the children of national schools to collect debris. Using their spare time from school, they cultivate in school halls and fields, and use the harvest to comfort wounded soldiers in hospitals.</p>
<p>The course of instruction is implemented regularly as before. For example, during girls' sewing time, cloth and yarn are given to sew pillows and quilts for wounded soldiers or to practice sewing baby clothes, in order to rationalize the academic work with practice. These works are accumulated every three months and sent to various parties.</p>
<p>However, the boys' cooking course is limited to the theory of how to cook family food, because it cannot waste food. Boys students manufacture models of airplanes, warships, and tanks during handicraft time, taking this opportunity to inform them of the importance of industry and the necessity of labor under wartime conditions. Only English is listed as a compulsory subject for foreign languages, and French is no longer valued. At this time, special attention is paid to sharpening the "weapon of knowing rigor."

<h3>Japanese Economic Mission Arrives in Beijing, Pays Respects to Chairman, Ambassador Gu Hosts Welcome Banquet That Evening, Members Express Impressions from Inspection</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese economic survey mission, led by Mr. Ogura Masatsune, arrived here at 2:20 PM on the 12th. After a short rest, they paid their respects to Chairman Wang of the National Government, and separately visited Minister Chu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Minister Mei Baoye, and General Commander Hata of the Japanese Army to pay their respects. They then went to the Japanese Naval Hospital to visit wounded and sick soldiers. In the evening at 7:00 PM, they attended a banquet hosted by Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Gu Zhengzhi.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese economic mission arrived in Beijing at 2:20 PM yesterday (the 12th). The group consists of twelve people, led by the head of the delegation, Masatsune Ogura. The list of members is recorded as follows: Head of the Delegation Masatsune Ogura. Members include: Akashi Teruo, Nango Saburo, Kotera Gengo, Yoshida Chiyo, Saku Izumiyama Sanroku, Hamano Kyohei, Akutsu Sekiichiro, Sekiguchi Takeo, Takagi Gaishi, etc.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - A Chinese economic survey mission, organized by Japanese economic experts and led by Chairman Ogura, arrived in Beijing by car from somewhere at 9:00 AM on the 12th. Our reporter immediately rushed to visit them, and Mr. Ogura promised to express his impressions on important issues such as Chinese currency, finance, and prices as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Ogura Masatsune said that he had been frankly exchanging opinions with Chinese dignitaries in Shanghai for many days and learned about the actual situation in China. At present, there are many proper policies that need to be implemented in Shanghai regarding price and currency issues. Therefore, I deeply hope that based on the opinions collected from various parties, after fully reviewing each issue, I will do my best for China's development. However, although China is a country with a long history, its national character and national conditions are quite different from those of Japan. It is necessary to have a full understanding of this point. Especially now, due to the unfolding of the new policy toward China, people in the Chinese economic circles are working hard with great hope, so it is also necessary to promote their creativity and research.</p>
<p>Mr. Akashi Teruo said that China currently has a huge amount of national capital, and on the other hand, the conditions for labor and equipment for production are also complete. Therefore, if national capital can be introduced into the production sector and utilized, it is quite promising to maintain the value of reserve coupons. However, the current Chinese economy, this national capital, and production are all acting individually, with different paces. This is quite different from Japan's integrated use of capital and production both internally and externally. Therefore, in China, it is an urgent task to properly guide and use national capital for the sake of China's development and for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. We hope that this issue can be resolved through cooperation between China and Japan and strive to move forward.</p>
<p>Mr. Nango Saburo said that from the perspective of trade, Central China is an extremely important region within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and it is also an urgent task to promote the exchange of materials between Central China and various parts of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. At the same time, the impact on prices and currency is also great. Under wartime conditions, the transportation of ships restricts the independent activities of various regions. For the sake of the future development of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, it is unnecessary. Under the overall integrated plan of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, material exchanges should be implemented. For example, China sends cotton to Japan, Japan sends cotton cloth to Thailand and India, and Thailand and India transport rice to Central China. This is a rationalized import and export situation in which each region uses necessities. Central China should also move along this direction to increase production.</p>
<p>Mr. Kotera Gengo said that the economic policy of the United Kingdom and the United States towards China has always been to buy Chinese raw materials at low prices and then distribute manufactured goods to China at high prices. However, for China's own development, Japan really needs to help China strengthen its production. Therefore, in the textile industry, it is necessary to not only strive to increase the production of cotton but also to consider the revitalization of the textile industry itself.</p>

<h3>Axis Forces on Sicily Win Counterattack, Cut Off Communications Behind Enemy Landing Forces, Fierce Fighting Continues on Southeast Coast</h3>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Haitian News Agency reports that responsible parties revealed that German and Italian elite forces began their counterattack on the Anglo-American beachhead in Sicily on Sunday morning, and have already achieved preliminary important victories. However, the war has not yet been announced. It is only known that the German and Italian forces have defeated the Anglo-American forces, cut off their rear communications, annihilated the remaining paratroopers, and reduced their beachhead fortresses. On Sunday, a large group of Axis bombers, under the protection of fighter planes, continued to bombard the Anglo-American landing forces.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to Berlin military sources, the main force of the Axis forces in Sicily, which was left to deal with the anti-Axis invading forces, launched a fierce counterattack on Sunday morning. The Haitian News Agency reported that before Sunday morning, the Axis defenders were limited to coastal defense forces. According to military news from the Haitian News Agency, anti-Axis forces had established four beachheads on the island, and two other landing attempts had been repelled. The landing was carried out near Cape Basero in the southeastern corner of the island and south of Syracuse last night. As for the second landing attempt in the same area, it was repelled by the local coastal defense forces. The second batch of anti-Axis landing ships, protected by many warships, entered the Gira Bay and established several beachheads near the city of Gira. In addition, two beachheads were established near Ligata, further west. The enemy's landing attempt northeast of Mazala failed due to the resistance of the coastal defense forces. It is said that the enemy's attack on Sicily began with paratroopers, who landed in the southeastern corner of the island at dawn on Saturday. Military personnel here point out that the area where the paratroopers landed is sparsely populated, which makes it possible to establish large-scale beachheads. However, according to official announcements, most of these paratroopers have been annihilated, and only a few small groups have fled into the hilly areas west of Laigaruk and have not been captured.</p>
<h3>Italian Torpedo Planes Fiercely Attack Enemy Ships</h3>
<p>Rome, 12th (Central News Agency) - Stefani News Agency reports that the Italian Air Force has been participating in the fighting in the Strait of Sicily and along the southeastern coast of Sicily since Friday evening. Heavy bombers bombed enemy convoys between Malta and the coast of Sicily, hitting many enemy ships in a series of attacks. At the same time, Italian bombers also bombed the port of Lavanda in Malta, destroying many merchant ships and light landing ships about to leave the port. On Sunday, the Italian air force, overcoming the enemy's fierce anti-aircraft fire, attacked enemy forces near the coast at low altitude and inflicted heavy damage. The pursuit aircraft unit also attacked the enemy landing fleet heading for the coast, destroying several landing ships. Later, dive bombers protected by fighter planes attacked heavily defended merchant ships. A huge merchant ship was hit by two bombs, and other smaller ships were also hit. Italian fighter planes shot down two anti-Axis bombers and severely damaged ten enemy bombers and several Spitfires while engaging "Mikkel"-type bombers and Spitfires. Last night, Italian aircraft continued to intercept enemy forces in the Sicilian Sea. Long-range bombers also hit several ships during their attack missions, and many enemy ships were seen on fire, followed by explosions. Other bomber squadrons repeatedly attacked the enemy fleet, medium-sized merchant ships, and landing ships in Sicily. Torpedo planes repeatedly intercepted the enemy fleet and achieved remarkable results. During the first attack, a ship was hit and exploded, revealing that it was loaded with ammunition and explosives. A 15,000-ton ship was also seriously damaged. One of the torpedo planes participating in the war was attacked by night fighters. Another torpedo plane squadron attacked the enemy fleet, hitting two 7,000-ton enemy cruisers, one of which was severely damaged and is believed to have sunk. In addition, a 6,000-ton transport ship also caught fire, and the crew escaped by boat. Torpedo planes carrying out a second sortie were also repeatedly attacked by enemy fighters, and the enemy aircraft pursued the Italian aircraft to their base. Italian aircraft also intercepted enemy ships off the coast of French North Africa to prevent the enemy's supply from reaching Sicily. At 10:20 PM, an Italian torpedo plane attacked an 8,000-ton ship five miles from Bianco. The ship was hit and exploded. A 5,000-ton cargo ship escorted by two destroyers was also sunk by an Italian torpedo plane.</p>

<h3>Fighting Intensifies in the Kursk Salient, Both Sides Transferring Elite Forces as Reinforcements, Offensive Advances Continue</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 12th (Central News Agency) - German forces seized new strongholds near Belgorod and south of Orel yesterday, serving as bases for their attacks on the Soviet line. Yesterday was the seventh day of the German counteroffensive in the Kursk salient, and the fierce fighting of tanks and mechanized units has intensified greatly. News from Moscow said that German General Klitzig had transferred elite tanks, aircraft, and infantry to join the battle. Although both sides suffered heavy losses, the strength of the offensive has not weakened. The Soviet side said that the Red Army is organizing a counteroffensive to cope with the German breakthrough and is transferring a large number of elite reserves and heavy artillery. However, German war reports said that the momentum of the march has not diminished slightly. In the large forest area east of Belgorod, German mechanized units, assisted by aircraft, penetrated the Soviet line in several places. The German army's battle results along the east bank of the Donets were obtained by defeating the powerful Soviet forces concentrated in that area. Although German actions were hindered by heavy rain and difficult terrain, they were still able to fully develop their offensive labor. Soviet forces south of Orel launched an attack with heavy tanks but were repelled by German forces and 28 tanks were destroyed. Another German unit took the risk of carrying out an encirclement operation, resulting in the capture of 29 tanks and 44 artillery pieces. The fiercest fighting is at the base of the spearhead action, where the Soviet command is now concentrating a large army and at the northern end of the spearhead, about 20 miles from Belgorod, where the two armies have fought bloody battles. According to a Reuters reporter stationed in Moscow, German General Kluge launched a large-scale attack yesterday in the aforementioned two locations. German forces added a large number of reserves to the fighting near Belgorod, and fierce new offensives also occurred simultaneously in the Orel and Kursk regions. This attack began at 6:00 AM, preceded by aircraft and heavy artillery bombardment, followed by tanks and motorized infantry. The attack location was the same as the previous day, namely a certain city near the railway. The Soviet side has admitted that German tank units have invaded several places. According to Reuters, on Saturday, more than 300 German and Soviet aircraft engaged in a large-scale aerial battle. Berlin estimates that in the first six days, the total losses of the Soviet army amounted to 1,709 tanks and 1,197 aircraft, and there are probably 800 more that have not returned to base.</p>
<h3>Viceroy Adopts Policy of Appeasement, Releases 318 Political Prisoners</h3>
<p>Stanbury, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a New Delhi dispatch: The Governor-General of India has suddenly and unconditionally released 318 political prisoners, including many Nationalist Congress Party fighters arrested last year for participating in the anti-British movement. Many believe that the Governor-General's move is a policy of appeasement towards the Congress Party in a panic and anxiety due to the rapid expansion of the Indian independence movement by Jantrabos, in an attempt to ease the domestic independence movement in India.</p>
<h3>Preventing Fifth Column Activities</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) - It is reported that the Governor-General's Office of India convened a defense meeting lasting three days, chaired by the Governor-General on the 5th of this month, and agreed on general countermeasures. According to the New Delhi correspondent of The Times, the Indian Defense Conference was held for three consecutive days and closed on the 5th. Minister of the Interior Mark Li Wilman reported in detail on the active situation of the Fifth Column in India, as well as the troublemakers and the aspect of the Fifth Column. This report has attracted attention from all parties.</p>
<h3>Former Czech President in Moscow, Southeast European Issues Certainly on the Agenda</h3>
<p>Stockholm, December 12th, Central News Agency: According to a Reuters report, a correspondent for the "Swedish Evening News" in London commented on the return of the Soviet Ambassador to the UK, Maisky, to Moscow, pointing out that London is also paying attention to Beneš's presence in the Soviet Union. Therefore, it can be inferred that in addition to the Soviet-Polish dispute, the issues currently being discussed in Moscow also include the boundaries and territorial issues of Southeast Europe.</p>
<h3>Severe Earthquake in the Southwest Pacific</h3>

<h3>Reflections on a British Tragedy</h3>
<p>— Tokutomi Iichiro (3)</p>
<p>If one were to investigate the list of knighthoods awarded on the British Emperor's birthday over the years, and explain their origins, although not every detail could be clarified, the main factor was the amount of money donated, which determined the rank and title. Therefore, if one were to research who the donors were, it would naturally become clear that Jewish money was at play. It is said that Lord Rosebery had three wishes in his youth: first, he wished to marry a wealthy woman; second, to win the Derby horse race; and third, to reach the position of Prime Minister. He indeed married the daughter of the world's richest Rothschild family. He also won the Derby horse race. As for the third wish, although it was not for long, he eventually served as Prime Minister for a short time. It goes without saying that the Rothschilds, naturally Jewish, were involved. In this way, Jewish blood flowed torrentially into the heart of the British aristocracy. Rosebery, the son-in-law, immediately received a knighthood. It is not difficult to imagine that Jewish blood permeated everything. And this is just one example.</p>
<p>The French once said that from Clemenceau to Jaurès, no French politician was untouched by Jewish hands! Whether this is true or not cannot be guaranteed, but France's downfall due to Jewish politicians and money is a real lesson before us. Similarly, in Germany, former Emperor Wilhelm II favored the shipping magnate Ballin, just as his uncle Edward VII favored Cassel. Ballin committed suicide before and after World War I, but the exact reasons remain unclear. It is commendable that he did his best to maintain peace between Britain and Germany from a Jewish perspective. In short, no country in the world is untouched by Jewish hands. People regard Cecil Rhodes as a great British hero. His plan to build a transcontinental railway from Cape Town to Cairo was indeed ambitious, but he failed because he did not work with the Jews in South Africa. Initially, he fought against them, but later, seeing no hope of winning, he had to join hands with them. Thus, Rhodes became a captive of the Jews. Rhodes invested a lot of money in British politics, especially donating a large sum to Parnell, the leader of the Irish Home Rule Party. But indirectly, it was Jewish money that manipulated the Irish party through Rhodes. Thus, can we say that Rhodes directly prompted Pitt to borrow money and donate it to the Irish Liberal Party?</p>
<p>Arthur Balfour was from a famous Conservative family, the nephew of Lord Salisbury. He had money, status, knowledge, and a handsome appearance, making him a perfect man. There was no need for him to rely on Jews. However, his so-called "declaration" during World War I caused great trouble in the United States. It is not necessary to elaborate on his declaration here. On November 2, 1917, he wrote a letter to Rothschild: "His Majesty's Government views with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this letter led the Jews to believe that Britain would use its greatest strength to create a homeland for the Jews in Palestine, and as a result, the Jews actively participated in World War I on the British side. Originally, Palestine was known to the world because of Christianity, and most of it was barren land, only suitable for limited use. But in any case, that place was not enough to support more than 1.5 million people. However, at that time, one million Arabs were already living there. However, because of this declaration, in the ten years from 1923 to 1933, the number of Jews increased from 83,000 to 230,000, and as a result, many disputes naturally arose between Jews and Arabs.</p>
<p>At that time, the British appointed the aforementioned Postmaster General Samuel as the first High Commissioner because he was the most suitable person to govern the Jews. However, a person suitable for governing Jews is not necessarily suitable for governing Arabs. Originally, there was Lawrence of Arabia among the Arabs, who, following the will of the British government, appeased the Arabs and promised them that if they helped Britain, Britain would restore the old Arab territories. Therefore, although the Arabs and the British were like fire and water, they ultimately helped Britain. However, now Britain does not fulfill any of its promises to both sides, causing Lawrence to die an unnatural death. In short, although Britain is suspected of favoring the Jews, the real power lies in the hands of the Arabs. In this way, Palestine has been in a state of unrest, and Britain has lost its credibility and influence in West Asia because it has failed to fulfill its promises to both sides.</p>
<p>As for the British atrocities in Palestine, Keltie has written a book called "British Reign of Terror," which describes them in detail. According to him, Balfour was lying, and Lawrence was lying. If we let the British examine themselves, perhaps there would be considerable justification, but the consequences of the Balfour Declaration are ultimately very serious. Britain's loss of power in West Asia undoubtedly stems from this. However, to interpret it further, it is a manifestation of Jewish power. To fall to Britain is to fall to a Jewish scheme.

<h3>Shanghai's Two Concessions Recovered, Tax Revenue Can Be Unified, Municipal Party Department and Others Expand Propaganda for the Recovery of Concessions</h3>
<p>(Shanghai, Central News Agency) Allied nation Japan, in order to fulfill its assistance to our country in completing the integrity of its territorial sovereignty, was pleased to sign an agreement with the National Government on June 30 to return the Shanghai International Settlement. Starting August 1, the government will take back all administrative powers of the International Settlement. As for the issue of returning the French Concession, Foreign Minister Chu has already come to Shanghai to negotiate with the French authorities. It is expected to be realized before the end of this month. After this, all financial advancements in Shanghai will be smoother than in the past. A Central News Agency reporter specially visited various central tax collection agencies in Shanghai to inquire about the future of tax revenue after the recovery of the concessions. A special report is as follows…</p>
<p>Consolidated Tax and Special Tax</p>
<p>The consolidated tax is a major source of financial revenue for our country. Shanghai, in particular, is a large port for trade with industrial nations, with factories lining the streets and businesses standing shoulder to shoulder. Various goods such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, cigarettes, flour, wheat, minerals, cement, etc., are all manufactured and distributed from Shanghai factories to various places. The collection of consolidated tax is mainly based in Shanghai. However, due to the concessions, our government's tax administration could not extend its collection and inspection work. Except for the cigarette tax, which was agreed upon with the concessions for enforcement and inspection, the inspection work for consolidated taxes on other goods was obstructed, resulting in smuggling and tax evasion. It was impossible to carry out inspections, which greatly affected tax revenue. After the concessions are returned to our country this time, tax administration can be uniformly promoted. The scope of inspection and tax administration for all consolidated taxes and special taxes will gradually improve, and tax revenue will inevitably increase. Currently, the Tax Investigation Department of the Ministry of Finance has begun to study the entire method of inspecting and collecting taxes after the recovery of the concessions.</p>
<p>Income Tax</p>
<p>Income tax is the obligation of the people to pay taxes. It has been implemented abroad for a long time, and our government has made progress in promoting it in recent years. Recently, after the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance actively adjusted it, the income tax policies of various regions have been brought into line. The tax revenue in the 29th year of the Republic of China was only a few million yuan, but by the 31st year of the Republic of China, it had increased to about 20 million yuan. Among them, the tax revenue from the Shanghai District Collection Bureau was the highest. However, due to the special nature of the concessions, the promotion has been repeatedly obstructed. Not only did foreign merchants in Shanghai not declare their tax obligations, but even the amount of income tax payable by Chinese merchants was delayed in reporting. The income tax collection authorities could not seriously promote it due to the special relationship of the concessions. This is also a major obstacle affecting tax revenue. After the recovery of the concessions, all merchants and residents in the Shanghai urban area, regardless of their nationality, have a tax obligation. With the unification of administrative power, the promotion of income tax collection will proceed more smoothly, and merchants and residents will not be able to escape and resist reporting taxes. It is estimated that tax revenue can increase by more than one-third.</p>
<p>Expanding Propaganda for the Recovery of Concessions</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Department of this city believes that since both the International Settlement and the French Concession will be recovered, all citizens are excited and fortunate. In order to make all citizens understand the significance of the recovery of the concessions and their future responsibilities, a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Party Departments of various districts was convened at the Department at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss and decide on expanding propaganda and holding celebration rallies. It is reported that preparations will be started with the relevant agencies in this city.</p>
<p>The Propaganda Department of Shanghai Special City is also following the seventh item of the expanded propaganda plan for the return of the Shanghai concessions promulgated by the Propaganda Department, which stipulates the composition of "The Great Shanghai March." It has now started work. It is heard that the song has been submitted to Mayor Chen for writing the lyrics and experts have been hired to compose the music. It is scheduled to be officially announced by the Municipal Government on the day the concessions are returned.</p>

<h3>Naval District Baojia Holds Second Anniversary Celebration Yesterday at Hongkou Park</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of a sound Baojia system in the naval district with the cooperation of the Allied naval authorities, the security of various districts and water Baojia has been ensured, so that all residents can live and work in peace and embark on the road to building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Yesterday (12th) was the second anniversary of its establishment. The naval district Baojia authorities specially held a grand celebration ceremony at 9:00 am at Hongkou Park in this city. In addition to the full participation of the Baojia personnel of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh military regions of the entire naval district, the office staff of the Naval Baojia Office and the district offices also attended. The commander of the Shanghai Naval Special Landing Force and Lieutenant Yantian of the Fleet Press Department, the police chief of the Public Concession, and Director Shigeota of the Baojia Guidance Department all attended the meeting. The total number of people was more than 5,000, and the situation was enthusiastic. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Solemn Ceremony</p>
<p>The Naval District Baojia Second Anniversary Celebration Conference was held on the large lawn in Hongkou Park. The national flags of China and Japan were hoisted high in the middle of the field, fluttering in the wind, creating a solemn atmosphere. The presidium was surrounded by red and white cloth curtains, making it even more beautiful and pleasing to the eye. The Baojia personnel of each district and the members of the self-defense corps in grass-green uniforms lined up in front of the platform, holding flags and looking very serious. The Public Concession drum and flute band also came to the venue to play music. At 9:00 am, the meeting was announced, and all paid the highest respect to the national flags of China and Japan, and prayed silently for the heroic spirits of the fallen soldiers of China and Japan. First, Mr. Hisabo Tokuji, Director of the Naval District Baojia Office, gave a speech, followed by a speech from the Commander of the Shanghai Naval Special Landing Force and a congratulatory speech from the police chief of the Public Concession. Then, the Commander of the Army Landing Force awarded certificates of merit to 62 Baojia personnel who had contributed to the Baojia. After the award ceremony, representatives elected by all Baojia members read the oath. Finally, everyone shouted "Long live!" Until 11:30 am, the conference was declared closed amid the high music.</p>
<p>Director Hisabo's Speech</p>
<p>Director Hisabo of the Naval District Baojia Office said in his speech: "Today is the second anniversary of the establishment of the Naval District Baojia. I am very honored that the commander and everyone came to guide us. The establishment of the Naval District Baojia was on July 12, 1941, when I was ordered by the Japanese fleet to start controlling Baojia in the entire district. With the guidance and encouragement of the naval authorities and the various police customs, we were able to complete our work in a short period of time. Today, the Naval District Baojia includes seven districts, with 360 Bao, 3,144 Jia, 121,320 households, and a total population of 611,359 people. This great achievement is due to the wise leadership of the naval authorities, the assistance of all parties involved, and the selfless efforts of the Baojia comrades. In future work, the self-defense corps, youth corps, air defense guidance classes, and epidemic prevention classes that have been organized above are all facts that the Baojia comrades have experienced day and night. In short, under the guidance of the authorities, in the complex Shanghai society, we are shouldering the responsibility of building a new order, ensuring security, and clarifying society, and we have all done our best. Now the Baojia organization has spread throughout Shanghai, and a dense cell organization has organized 3 million citizens, assisting in completing the system for the Greater East Asia War, building a bright Shanghai, and becoming the rear base for this war to establish the road to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. We are proud of this, and this glory will be permanently recorded in the annals of Greater East Asia."</p>
<p>Commander's Speech</p>
<p>The Commander of the Shanghai Naval Special Landing Force continued with a speech, saying: "Since the start of the Greater East Asia War, in view of the excellent achievements of the Shanghai Naval District Baojia, the Baojia organizations have also been established one after another in the western district of the Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession, allowing the citizens themselves to automatically assist in maintaining Shanghai's security. The difficulty of developing this good custom is great, and its merits are great. Shanghai is not only the center of the new China, but also an important stronghold of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, it must be made a place where citizens can live and work in peace. To seek peace and prosperity, we must first maintain good security. Shanghai is a large city with special characteristics. To make it perfect, we need the cooperation of all citizens. The significance of the Baojia organization is very important and great. Looking back on the efforts of all of you in the past two years since the establishment of Baojia, I feel that there is hope. However, we still need to double our efforts. On this deeply meaningful second anniversary, I hope that all of you will rise up and cooperate, unite as one, and move forward for the construction of Greater Shanghai and Greater East Asia, and strengthen the Baojia organization to achieve perfection."</p>
<p>Police Chief's Speech</p>
<p>Next, the visiting Police Chief gave a congratulatory speech, saying: "The spirit of the Hongkou Baojia is good. I hope that you will continue to work hard and contribute to the construction of Greater Shanghai."</p>
<p>Parade</p>
<p>A parade was held immediately. In addition to the Baojia personnel of the entire conference, there were also boy scouts, drum teams, national music bands, military bands from various districts, as well as specially made floats and opera-themed trucks. They all lined up and set off at the entrance of Hongkou Park. The music along the way was melodious, and the flags were colorful and dazzling. The floats and opera-themed trucks were particularly varied. At 7:00 pm, the cadre personnel of the Baojia in the Tonghai Naval District held a joint banquet in the large banquet hall of the Wenlu Japanese Club. The atmosphere was harmonious and the cups were exchanged. It was not until about 9:00 pm that the meeting was dismissed. At the same time, fireworks were set off on the square at the intersection of Tangshan Road and Kunming Road to celebrate.</p>
<h3>The Third "Marine Day"</h3>
<p>The Greater East Asia War is a naval war with the vast Pacific Ocean as its stage. On this immense sea surface, the merchant fleet and transport fleet, assisting the navy and operating actively in all directions, are indeed working extremely hard. At the same time, the activities of these sailors are a crucial part of the war's victory. To thank these sailors and to popularize the understanding of the ocean among the people, thereby advancing overseas, the "Marine Day" has been established.</p>
<p>July 20th marks the third "Marine Day." Under the Greater East Asia War, grand "Marine Day" ceremonies will be held both domestically and abroad. In Shanghai, the Naval Association Shanghai Branch, the Shanghai Naval Roundtable, and the Shanghai Resident Group, will be the three groups at the center of various grand ceremonies on this day. To commemorate the occasion, the Greater East Asia Broadcasting Station has specially arranged a week-long "Marine Day" special program, scheduled to begin on the 18th at 6:30 PM with a speech by Resident Group Leader Watanabe. On the 20th, it will broadcast "Marine Day Evening" from the International Theater, along with other speeches, music, and dramas.</p>
<p>Regarding the overall ceremony, the following events are currently being planned by relevant organizations. To complete the decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War, we must strengthen publicity to deepen understanding of the navy. The commemorative ceremony is tentatively scheduled as follows:</p>
<p>July 20th, afternoon: Approximately 500 secondary school students will conduct an on-site visit to the launch ceremony of a certain ship at the Jiangnan Shipyard.</p>
<p>Afternoon: "Marine Day Evening"</p>
<p>Venue: International Theater</p>
<p>Speech: "The Third Marine Day" by Colonel Kamata, China Fleet Press Officer (broadcast)</p>

<p>July 21st, morning: A solemn safe voyage prayer ceremony and a memorial service for sailors who died in service and in battle will be held at the Shanghai Shrine. Military officers and various organizations will attend.</p>
<p>In addition, 600 sixth-grade students from national schools will ride on a merchant ship of the East Asia Shipping Company on the Huangpu River, visiting the interior of the merchant ship to experience naval thought. Moreover, during this commemoration, to enable the people and schools of all levels to better understand the ocean thought under the decisive battle and the current situation of the Greater East Asia War, 13 purchasing representatives will be dispatched by various shipping companies to send 20,000 consolation letters to sailors from national schools and secondary schools.</p>
<p>Furthermore, during the "Marine Day" week, slogans and billboards will be posted all over the Hongkou district and major roads to increase the general public's interest in the sea.</p>
<h3>Police Department Notifies All Baojia to Reorganize Their Police Corps; Self-Defense Members Must Fill Out Service Oaths, Must Not Deliberately Be Absent from Duty or Late</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Police Department, in order to stabilize local order, recently notified the district Lianbao to instruct each Baojia to reorganize the self-defense corps. The reporter has specially recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Strict Prohibition of Absence from Duty Without Reason</p>
<p>Each district Baojia has completed the re-checking of household registrations in its jurisdiction. After receiving orders from the Police Department, it has copied and submitted the qualified men aged 20 to 43 from the new household registration survey forms. They have been assigned posts and notified that if unqualified substitutes or absences are discovered in the future, they will be immediately reported to the Police Department for severe punishment.</p>
<p>Self-Defense Corps Members to Fill Out Oaths</p>
<p>Those who have previously requested exemption from service should also submit definite proof documents and submit them for registration to be filed for verification. At the same time, according to the reporter's reliable information, for the sake of solemnity, the self-defense members of each Baojia district will begin to fill out service oaths starting today, vowing not to deliberately violate the important regulations of the Baojia self-defense corps. It is also found that the heads of each household must also fill out this type of oath, guaranteeing that the self-defense members in the household will not deliberately be absent from duty or late when performing their duties. If any are found, they will voluntarily accept joint punishment and will not shirk responsibility.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Japanese Cultural Circles Welcome Director Liang</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai) Since the National Government officially announced the appointment of Liang Xiuyu, advisor to the Propaganda Department, as the Director of the Shanghai Special Municipality Propaganda Office, the relevant authorities in this city, as well as the Chinese and Japanese cultural circles, various newspapers, magazines, and the China Book and Drama Association, have decided to jointly express their welcome. A welcome tea party will be held at the International Hotel tomorrow (the 14th) at 3:00 PM for friendly gathering.</p>
<h3>News Association Advocates Thrift Movement</h3>
<p>The Shanghai News Association, recognizing that modern wartime nations all regard thrift as essential to achieving ultimate victory, and since the National Government, cooperating with friendly nations, declared war on Britain and the United States, has made great efforts to promote the thrift movement. However, it has not achieved the expected results. Shanghai, in particular, still sees significant waste of resources and an especially prevalent trend of extravagance, which not only affects wartime material strength but also stimulates high prices, making life difficult for ordinary citizens. Therefore, it has launched a campaign to promote thrift, strengthen war effort, and correct social morals. The association has formulated detailed plans for promoting the thrift movement, using the media to mobilize public opinion, so that citizens can universally practice thrift, and making suggestions to the authorities to lead and promote the movement. The main points include advocating wearing old clothes, cloth clothes, and short clothes; refraining from banquets, drinking, and large-scale entertainment; and using tea and snacks for weddings and funerals, to cultivate a thrifty atmosphere and achieve the goal of thrift. It has been decided that from July 15th to July 31st will be an expanded publicity week. It is reported that the association may invite relevant authorities and powerful organizations in the city to cooperate and jointly promote the thrift movement, and regularly hold public speaking events on the thrift movement, inviting social celebrities to give speeches in turn.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Bureau Director Reports on the City Ferry Incident</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government held a weekly meeting yesterday, where Ye Xisong, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, reported on the handling of the Dongchang ferry accident at Qingning Temple. (1) All personnel related to the incident within the City Ferry Company have been punished accordingly, and the absconding helmsman has been reported for wanted status. (2) The City Ferry Company has provided compensation to the families of the victims according to their names. (3) The City Ferry Company has been urged to strictly comply with restrictions on ticket sales, dock management, and all dock improvement matters.</p>
<h3>French Concession Issues Next Month's Bread Certificates</h3>
<p>The French Concession started issuing August and September wheat bread certificates, sugar purchase certificates, and artificial butter ration certificates to foreign residents yesterday. Each food-buying household should go to collect them according to the prescribed dates.</p>
<h3>No Horns Allowed Late at Night</h3>
<p>According to the Traffic and Air Defense Department of the Public Works Bureau: Recently, the weather has been hot, and most windows are open. Many cars speeding and honking their horns late at night have prevented residents from sleeping peacefully. In previous summers, the Vehicle Affairs Department of the Police Department strictly prohibited this unnecessary and annoying behavior. It is reported that this year it will be carried out again. In addition, the use of high beams by private and taxi cars in prohibited areas will also be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Notice from the Radio Supervision Office</h3>
<p>The Supreme Commanders of the Japanese Army and Navy issued an announcement on December 18th last year and made statements that radio receivers listed as prohibited for use must be modified or bought by the authorities. The Radio Supervision Office has now issued the following notice:</p>

<h3>Huatong Cup Charity Soccer Tournament: Lianyi Regular Match Against St. Paul's United; Premieres This Saturday in Xuhui</h3>
<p>The Huatong Cup Charity Soccer Tournament, organized by the Huatong Sports Association of this city, invites the Lianyi Association, the new Chinese champion of Shanghai, to compete against the Western Iron Army St. Paul's United. The first match has been scheduled to kick off this Saturday (the 17th) at the Xuhui Middle School field. The second match will take place next Wednesday (the 21st) at Xuhui General Stadium. Huatong Sports Association President Jiang Yimen has donated prizes. Ticket revenue will be used to fund the education of orphaned children. Since reorganizing last year, the Lianyi team has invited famous Hong Kong players Li Tiansheng, Song Lusheng, Liu Xianhan, Zheng Yingquan, Li Yichen, and Qu Yongfu to Shanghai, adding top local talent Sun Jinshun, Zhang Lingen, Wu Qixiang, Gao Baozheng, Fei Chunhua, etc., to form an extremely strong lineup. Subsequently, they participated in the Western League A group, with 7 wins and 4 draws in 11 matches, taking the top spot. Furthermore, the team recently managed to overwhelm the Zhanjun Donghua Association in the North China Disaster Relief Soccer Tournament, seemingly becoming the new Chinese champion. Their momentum is strong and their morale is high. St. Paul's United gathers the elite from St. Francis and the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce teams, with countless war generals under its command. The Shanghai representatives Victor and Foran are already well-known. However, Xu Erz, Olivera, Gayne, Carrolie District, V Su Ruo, and W Shen Tuo Xun Feng are all top-tier talents. Their strength is self-evident. When the Jing'an Baojia Football Charity Game was held at the Racecourse last week, the team managed to defeat the Li Lian team with a score of 4 to 3. The performance was so wonderful that more than ten thousand fans were mesmerized. This time, competing against the Luyi team is tantamount to vying for the Shanghai football throne. At that time, the great battle between the Chinese and Western troops will definitely be an unprecedented and intense competition. Who will be the victor is unpredictable. To avoid the scorching sun, all matches will start at 6:30 PM.</p>

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Jianbu Begins to Increase Grain Production</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency Tokyo电 reported on the 9th of this month that Chen Junpu, Minister of Construction of the National Government and Secretary-General of the National Economic Committee, recently hosted a press group at the Tokyo Imperial Hotel, where he stated: "The Ministry of Construction, in order to adapt to the new situation, reorganized and expanded the former Ministry of Communications and the Water Conservancy Commission in February of this year, with the highest goal of developing the economy and stabilizing people's livelihoods. Furthermore, to develop the undertakings of these two organizations, it was decided to implement a three-year construction plan, striving to achieve it. The three-year construction plan focuses on the development of farmland irrigation. Currently, work has begun on the opening of Mengdong Taihu, and a technical team has been dispatched to work. Once the on-site survey is completed, reclamation will begin. It is estimated that after the Mengdong Taihu reclamation plan is completed, 16,000 hectares of fertile land can be obtained, which can yield 70 million dan of rice. As for the development of other Yangtze River swamp areas, planning has also begun, and a decision has been made to expedite its realization."</p>
<p>On the same day, the Suzhou report from the same agency stated: "The Jiangsu Construction Department recently organized the East Taihu Consultation Team to conduct surveys in order to improve the water conservancy plan... The Ministry of Construction... also appointed Cai Fuchu, a senior commissioner, as well as Wang Jiazhang and Tao Jiaxian, technical specialists from the Water Conservancy Department, and invited Japanese water conservancy expert Aki Kyoi to form the East Taihu Water Conservancy Consultant Group. The group departed from Kyoto a few days ago to inspect the East Taihu Basin and the surrounding area of Fanshan Lake, and to collect general water conservancy-related materials. The inspection area includes Suzhou, Shanghai, Wujiang, Jiaxing, Songjiang, Qingpu, Changshu, and other places. When necessary, important towns and districts along Taihu Lake may also be inspected. The inspection period is more than twenty days."</p>
<p>After carefully reviewing the above two reports, we feel that the government has made a firm decision to implement water conservancy improvements and increase grain production to stabilize people's livelihoods, no longer "sitting and talking without taking action" or "making a lot of noise but accomplishing little" as in the past. If the plan to increase rice production by 70 million dan in the East Taihu area each year can be realized, the food problem in the Southeast can be solved immediately, which will undoubtedly contribute significantly to the successful conclusion of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Thoroughly Investigate Illegal Hoarding to Suppress Commodity Prices</h3>
<p>To thoroughly investigate the illegal hoarding of large quantities of major commodities by Chinese and foreign merchants in Shanghai, a Commodity Investigation Committee has been established to vigorously prevent hoarding, thereby suppressing commodity prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods. At the same time, Qianzhuang and various industries in the money industry are stopping accepting mortgages on major commodities. Regarding the storage, sale, and manufacturing of major commodities (including raw materials and finished products), all interested parties must register in accordance with the law: (1) owners, (2) warehouse operators or trustees, (3) pledgees, (4) insurers, (5) carriers. If the applicant is a member of a trade association, the application should be forwarded by the relevant trade association, including: (1) the type and name of the commodity, (2) the quantity of the commodity, (3) the source of the commodity and the time and value of its acquisition, (4) the packaging method, (5) the storage location, (6) the trademark, location, and names and addresses of the persons in charge of the commodity owners, (7) the trademark, business location, and names and addresses of the persons in charge of the applicants, (8) the date of filing. The competent authorities will implement inspections of warehouses and the inventory of major commodities in companies and firms in accordance with the reported major commodities. Anyone who hoards major commodities for profit without being a member of a trade association, or sells major commodities to non-members of trade associations knowing that they are not direct consumers, and anyone who conceals or fails to register and report the major commodities they store, will have their commodities confiscated regardless of whether they belong to the offender, and will be punished in accordance with the crime prevention regulations. Those who manipulate market prices and disrupt the market will be severely punished.</p>
<p>According to a Japanese newspaper report yesterday, the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession, recognizing the high prices on the black market, in order to thoroughly suppress unscrupulous merchants, in addition to previously issuing a statement, will conduct stricter inspections of speculative merchants engaged in major commodities, especially cotton yarn and cloth.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Orders Adjustment of Shanghai Financial Institutions</h3>
<p>Regarding the Ministry of Finance's reorganization of financial institutions in Shanghai, there were rumors of mergers. Later, the Ministry of Finance announced the revised Banking Registration Regulations and Provisional Regulations for the Registration of Trust Companies, clarifying that the Ministry of Finance decided not to use mandatory merger methods to reorganize small banks and Qianzhuang in Shanghai, but to increase the capital amount to consolidate the foundation of financial institutions. It is now known that the Shanghai Banking and Qianzhuang Associations have received an order from the Ministry of Finance to instruct all banks and Qianzhuang, based on the new regulations and laws, to increase capital within six months. (1) The capital of banks and Qianzhuang (i.e., those organized as limited liability companies) should be increased to at least six million yuan, with three million yuan fully paid up. (2) The capital of ordinary commercial banks that also operate trust business should be at least five million yuan (three million yuan for bank funds and two million yuan for trust department funds). If the capital is not increased after the six-month deadline and does not comply with the legal regulations, they will be ordered to merge or close down. It is reported that after receiving the order, all banks and Qianzhuang are actively preparing to convene extraordinary shareholders' meetings to decide on capital increase methods.</p>
<h3>Wheat Purchase Progresses Smoothly, Flour Mills Start Operating</h3>
<p>The Flour and Wheat Monopoly Association, recognizing that wheat has already entered the market in various regions, in order to implement unified purchase, centralized distribution, and maintain food supplies, followed the "Wheat Purchase Plan" set by the Business Management Committee. Each flour mill entrusted merchants and local wheat firms to register with the committee first, and then purchase uniformly according to the specified prices and regions. Branch offices have been established in Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, Anqing, Nantong, Hangzhou, Yangzhou, Bengbu, Wuhu, etc., and huge loans of 100 million yuan have been provided by the Bank of Communications and other banks. Therefore, the wheat purchase work is progressing smoothly with the cooperation of all parties. Moreover, this year's wheat harvest is relatively poor, with the yield in various regions increasing by an average of about 30% compared to last year, especially in Jiangbei and the Bengbu and Xuzhou areas. The reporter recently learned from relevant sources that the total estimated wheat yield in various regions is approximately 20 million dan. (1) The Beijing-Shanghai Line: Suzhou 1 million dan, Wuxi 2 million dan, Changzhou 1 million dan, Zhenjiang 1 million dan, Nanjing 500,000 dan, Anting 500,000 dan, Kunshan 600,000 dan, Danyang 600,000 dan, Taicang 500,000 dan, Jiading 300,000 dan. (2) The Jiangbei Line: Yangzhou 2.7 million dan, Gaoyou 3 million dan, Taizhou 1.5 million dan, Xinghua 300,000 dan, other counties 3 million dan. (3) Wuhu 1.5 million dan. (4) The Tianjin-Pukou Line: 1 million dan. However, it is heard that the actual harvest in Jiangbei and Tianjin-Pukou Line regions may exceed the estimated quantity. Flour mills in Shanghai, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, and other places in Central China have already resumed operations one after another as wheat has entered the market, manufacturing flour to supply food to various places.</p>
<h3>Hua Stock Trends</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Hua stocks rose sharply. After the market opened in the morning, there were no sellers, and prices jumped wildly. It was not until 11:20 AM that, forced by investors seeking to realize profits at high prices, the market finally turned firm again at noon. The department store industry took the lead. Wing On stood out and passed major barriers, while Sincere and China Products were also in a state of high demand and short supply. Underwear also surpassed critical points, and Jinglun socks accelerated their gains, breaking through two barriers in a row. Jingfu followed suit and rose. The public utilities industries of Zhabei Water and Electricity and China General Edison Company rose all the way. The former went outside the pass again. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company stood firmly at four barriers. The rise of Great China Match was also unexpected. The rise of Wing On Textile in the textile industry has slowed, while Sintoon and Wing Feng have risen steadily. New China Printing &amp; Weaving and Da Zhonghua Weaving have remained firm and constant. In the cultural industry, China Theatre and New World both flew outside the pass, and Commercial Press also rose strongly. New pharmaceutical stocks still had more consolidation. New Asia, Franco-China, Shanghai Union Dispensary, and Wang Zhou rose in unison. Minyi, China-Western, and Star Perfumery were stable and firm. The transaction price of China Enamelware was unexpectedly high.</p>

<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>The China Stock Daily, located at No. 613 Securities Building, has been published for over a year, promoting the Hua stock business and introducing industrial and commercial content. It has always been known for its accuracy and is an important reference material for the industrial and commercial circles and investors. Therefore, its sales have been increasing daily. Recently, the newspaper has been seeking further improvement. Starting this month, it has launched a special feature on famous figures in the Chinese industrial, commercial, and financial enterprise sectors, specializing in introducing the successful history of establishing businesses, providing general observation and imitation. The content is all personally interviewed and investigated by staff, so it is extremely authentic. This innovation not only enhances the newspaper but also adds a unique touch to the national enterprise sector.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Zhenya Commercial Bank held an extraordinary shareholders' meeting yesterday afternoon at the Bank Association on Hong Kong Road, with more than 200 shareholders, including Chen Mingxiang, Wang Boyong, and Lu Youbai, attending. Chairman Chen Yafu presided over the meeting and reported on the significance of the extraordinary shareholders' meeting, then began discussing matters.

<h3>Impressions of the Japanese Economic Mission to China</h3>
<p>The Chinese and Japanese Private Economic Mission stayed in Shanghai for four days after arriving on the 7th. They successively had talks with the Army and Navy authorities, Ambassador Tajiri of the Embassy Office, Mayor Chen, and the Chinese and Japanese authorities concerned, the Business Management Committee, the Bank Association, the Qianzhuang Association, the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Liaison Association, the East Asia Economic Roundtable, and the Central China Headquarters. The business has been completed. They took a car to Beijing on the morning of the 12th, and planned to visit Chairman Wang, Minister of Finance Zhou, and Chief Mei, Standing from the position of Japanese private businessmen, they exchanged views on economic issues after the implementation of the new policies. Although the mission's time in Shanghai was short, it has already achieved great success in promoting Sino-Japanese economic cooperation.</p>
<p>The purpose of the economic mission to China has been clearly elaborated in the speech of the head of the delegation, Ogura. The intention is nothing more than that Chinese and Japanese businessmen should make further economic cooperation to create the foundation for promoting the new economic policy. Since the establishment of the Business Management Committee, the cessation of issuing military ticket new banknotes, the abolition of restrictions on the movement of some materials in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and the implementation of the return of concessions, the economic situation in Central China has undergone considerable changes. In the current new stage, whether Chinese businessmen have the same opinions as Japanese private businessmen, and what their goals are as Chinese businessmen who shoulder the important task of implementing the new policy, have been made clear by Akira Akashi, Masaji Yoshida, Kojirabara and Sanruo Nango who are in charge of finance, through discussions with the magnates of Chinese financial and textile circles on the relevant issues within the scope of their expertise. The results have been extremely satisfactory. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>National Government Financial Balance</h3>
<p>The people are quite concerned about the financial revenue and expenditure situation after the return of the National Government to the capital. This reporter recently met a gentleman familiar with the financial situation, who reported that the national government's financial revenue and expenditure have always been balanced. For three years, there has not only been no budget deficit, but there have also been savings, and there has never been an overdraft from the Central Reserve Bank. Friendly countries should also praise this sound financial situation. In addition, regarding the Central Reserve Bank's supervision of issuance business, the bank has a council of advisors, hiring financial giants as advisors, and the amount of issuance is reported to the council.</p>

<h3>Missed Opportunity</h3>
<p>— Zhao Xiang</p>
<p>A friend wrote, saying he missed a "chance" three years ago. At that time, he had too much free time and could have used it to study a foreign language. By now, he would have made some progress, at least laid a foundation, and wouldn't be in his current situation.</p>
<p>It is common to only realize an opportunity after it has been missed. If one could grasp the key to an extraordinary opportunity beforehand, taking advantage of a critical moment to turn things around, that would certainly not be an ordinary talent. However, if one seizes ordinary opportunities one by one, never giving up a moment, without harboring fantasies of instant success, but instead honestly and steadfastly taking each step one at a time, ordinary people can also achieve success.</p>
<p>Today, feeling regret for missing yesterday's opportunity is useless in itself. In addition to regret, lamenting, being frustrated, feeling ashamed, and blaming oneself are also useless. If you don't work hard today, it will be easy to understand why the same sad emotions will reappear tomorrow!</p>
<p>Opportunity never waits for people; only the incompetent wait for opportunity, while the brave create opportunity.</p>
<p>In every tick of the clock, there lies an opportunity to change human destiny; only those who strive in time will catch up and seize it, while the lazy won't even see its shadow!</p>
<h3>Walking as a Carriage</h3>
<p>— Li Zhi</p>
<p>The days are getting longer and longer, and the weather is getting warmer and warmer. Because I don't want to endure the life-threatening squeeze on the trams, I always walk to the office and back home every day.</p>
<p>When I walk, I look straight ahead, try to keep my body balanced, and hum a marching song softly. My steps follow the beat, neither fast nor slow, from the vegetable market on Cante Road to the Bund, without feeling breathless at all. While walking, I plan my work schedule: when I go to the company in the morning, I decide what official business I should handle today, how should I handle it? Which should I handle first? Which should I handle later? When I go home in the evening, I also decide on my evening work, what books I should read? What should I write? And so on. By the time my plan is complete, I am not far from my destination, leaving me no time to think about the fatigue of walking.</p>
<p>In this way, I get many benefits:</p>
<p>1.  A reduction in expenses, saving on transportation costs.</p>
<p>2.  Strengthening of the leg muscles.</p>
<p>3.  Developing the habit of waking up early and getting up immediately, making me clear-headed and agile during the day.</p>
<p>4.  Increased work efficiency, making life more disciplined and clearer.</p>
<p>5.  Mental peace, without dreams at night.</p>
<h3>The Righteous Receive Much Help</h3>
<p>— Wang Yichen</p>
<p>The children gave me an entrance ticket and insisted that I attend the parents' meeting held at their school. Because that day was originally a holiday, and I couldn't resist the children's coaxing, I went to Zhongying Elementary School, which I had long wanted to see. The location was Lane 668 across the road. I went twice, once in the morning to see the achievements exhibition, and once in the afternoon to see the entertainment. The children were very satisfied, and so was I.</p>
<p>Each classroom was freshly painted, and all the desks and test papers were not only arranged in an orderly manner but also had ingenious new designs. From the achievements shown in the test papers, I must honestly say that they were much better than those of other nearby schools.</p>
<p>The entertainment program was held in the schoolyard. A stage was actually built, and two or three hundred benches were placed to accommodate five or six hundred people. All the programs were performed by the students themselves. Although they were nothing more than various songs, dances, and dramas, what they performed was indeed both beautiful and refined, different from the vulgar.</p>
<p>After seeing all these things, I couldn't help but feel suspicious. The school had only been established for a year, so why did it have such achievements? Could it be that the principal was a wealthy man with ample funding, so everything was easy to do? I took the opportunity to visit Principal Fang, but Principal Fang's answer was beyond my expectations.</p>
<p>Principal Fang said that she herself had no money, and what little money she had was used up at the beginning. This semester's deficit was terrible, but there were some enlightened people in society who listened to partial truths, such as Ma Yinliang, Lu Gao, Xia Zhafang, Pan Yangyao, Wang Wanbai, Yan Yanxian, and Zhou Xingchu. When they heard this news, they automatically donated a lot of money, which not only made up for this semester's deficit but also covered future shortfalls. Most of them also became school directors, laying a permanent foundation for the school. As for why others were willing to help, Principal Fang said that it was because she was truly running the school for education and had gained the trust of the general public over the past year. She absolutely did not want to treat the school as a private possession, as a means of getting rich, or as an easy job.</p>
<p>Oh, so Principal Fang was completely relying on the help of others. I couldn't help but think of the saying, "The righteous receive much help." Therefore, I believe that as long as the motive is pure and the effort is made, any undertaking will succeed. I am writing the above situation to provide a lesson for those who aspire to start a business. (Moved Aid to Study)</p>
<h3>Chicken</h3>
<p>— Shen Shen</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, he added, "Go tell that guy surnamed Li to be sensible, or he can forget about having a good night's sleep tonight!" Commander × urged Staff Officer Zhang to take care of it, threatening the town chief Li. Staff Officer Zhang was indeed in a dilemma. If he went, he had already said everything he could to town chief Li. If he didn't go, Commander × wouldn't let it go easily. Besides, he thought, I'm a local, and I might still have to see my neighbors and elders in the future, so how can I be an excessive accomplice? Commander × is just relying on a few guns, doing enough evil things already. One day, the robber will meet his match. This bowl of rice will eventually be hard to swallow. I've been loyal enough to him in the past, and this time I'm prepared to be rejected. At most, I'll go back to my hometown to scavenge, to drive fish for others, and get nothing for myself. It's really not worth it. The more Staff Officer Zhang thought, the more resentful he became, and he couldn't help but say:</p>
<p>"Commander! I really can't say anything more to them, even if I do, it's useless. You can do whatever you want. I came here a few months ago with just a short shirt and pants, and I'm prepared to leave with just a short shirt and pants. You promised me this and that at the beginning, how much profit I would get each month, but today I only see you moving money in and out. I quit, I'm going home tomorrow!" Staff Officer Zhang said in one breath, stood up, his face flushed red, clenched his fists, and walked out. As he passed Commander ×, Commander × suddenly patted Staff Officer Zhang's shoulder with a friendly expression, pushed him inward, and said:</p>
<p>"Oh, Lao Zhang! What's wrong? Are you angry over this little thing? Sit down, let's discuss it again!" Commander × persuaded Staff Officer Zhang to sit down, and Zhang sat down with his head lowered, not saying a word. Commander × thought that Zhang had been here for a few months and had indeed driven a lot of fish for him, but he hadn't received a penny. For a moment, he seemed a little uneasy. Zhang could still write a few words and was very useful here, so he couldn't do without him. Under this idea, Commander × continued to say to Staff Officer Zhang very kindly:</p>
<p>"Lao Zhang! Don't be angry, don't worry, I understand. We will share the good fortune together. Here, I'll give you three hundred yuan for pocket money." As he spoke, he reached into his pocket, took out a roll of banknotes, took three stacks, and stuffed them into Staff Officer Zhang's hand, and didn't mention what had just happened. Staff Officer Zhang reluctantly put the banknotes on the table and remained silent with his head lowered. Commander × seemed very docile, patting Zhang's shoulder and saying:</p>
<p>"Lao Zhang! We are brothers, there's no need to be angry. Go take care of that person's business casually! I don't care!" After saying that, he stood up, put the banknotes on the table into his pocket, helped Zhang up, and pushed him out, showing extraordinary intimacy. (Nine)</p>
