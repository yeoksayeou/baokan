<h3 id="c1">望友邦日本傾聽老百姓的呼聲 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>中日共同協定發表以後，日本放棄在華領事裁判權及交還租界與敵產等，已經進入實踐階段了。這是中日關係劃時代的進展，也是中日兩大民族永遠合作的基本出發點。比之英美對重慶政權所作同樣諾言之口惠不實，完全不同。我們希望兩國當局對此特別出之以莊嚴審愼的態度，而有振奮東亞全體民族的表現。不過，我們深覺得，在這一實踐過程中，日本當局同時還須注意幾件事情，特別是和中國老百姓最有密切關係的事情。</p>
<p>放棄領事裁判權，交還租界，移交敵產，這是在未來中日國交史上最光輝的史頁，這他是日本扶助中國向獨立自强前途發展最有力的表示。不過，一般的說，在目前，直接感到這種東亞道義精神之實惠的，還只是中國的當局和一部份上層份子，至於中國老百－大多數的中層和下層份子，對於友邦這種有力的表示，在目前，無寗說是非常糢糊的，不是最關痛癢的。他們的了解，和身受實惠，將是較久的未來，而不是目前。而中國一般老百姓却正是目前對日協力和保衛大東亞戰爭中最有力的支持者，只有他們自發自動的拿出全力來支持，中日兩國的緊密協力和爭取大東亞戰爭最後勝利的一切政策，才能順利和澈底的完成。所以我們輿論界，除了以衷誠的感激之情，對於日本之放棄在華治外法權，交還租界，移交敵產等，表示敬意。可是，同時，不能不以同樣的熱誠，盼望日本當局百尺竿頭，更進一步，洞察中國老百姓的迫切需求，而表示與放棄治外法權，交還租界，移交敵產等等相等的好意。</p>
<p>目前中國老百姓所迫切需求日本方面協助解決的，當然不只是一件二件事情，但最重要的，莫過是日常生活的安定。尤其迫切的第一是食糧問題。中國是農業國，本來是糧食足以自給自足的，不過爲了戰時的特殊情形，和供應調劑上沒有盡如理想，以至形成人民生活上最受威脅的問題，而普遍地影響到國民心理，成爲社會不安的一大因素。其次是物價問題。本來，在戰時，物價的波動和上漲，原是各國所不免的現象，只要社會組織嚴密，國家政今貫澈，和人民心理安定，是不會發生嚴重後果的。日本在戰爭六年以來，甚至於在對世界最富强的英美作戰一年餘以來，也沒有發生嚴重的物價問題，就是這個原因。可是，在我們中國，物價問題造成了極少數人的暴富，更造成了大多數人民日常生活的莫大威脅。過去中日當局未嘗不憚思竭慮，以謀解決；而全面的限價，合理的管制，以收最理想最美滿的結果，還有待於未來。其三，是交通運輸問題，旅客天天所感受的不必要的阻難與痛苦，是無庸諱實，僅僅因地因時而有程度的差異而已。至於物資，如原料之採售輸送，製成品的分配，也不免交通上的不方便，而使中國大多數的農工商人感到苦悶；結果對於戰時生產的增進物資的合理交換與調達，都不免受到不良的影響，還會直　間接的影響到物價和國民生活上面去。</p>
<p>諸如此類的問題，有時在表面上看來是枝節的，瑣碎的，可是實際上却和大多數人民的日常生活具有非常密切關係。所以，如果日本當局能够加以特別的注視，謀求迅速的合理的解決，我們深信友邦今日在這一方面多一分努力，那麼其所收的效果，雖不一定比放棄治外法權，交還租界與敵產等等來得偉大，可是一定更爲中國大多數人民所容易了解與擁護，其收效也切實與迅速。而同時，又足以輔助兩國政府在實施戰時政策時，更爲順利。</p>

<p>汪委員長訓話全文</p>
<p>南京十五日中央社電　一月九日、國民政府宣佈參加大東亞戰爭、與友邦日本協力打倒共同敵人英美侵略主義者、因此召集這一回的全國軍事會議、其意義是非常重大的、</p>
<p>自從前年十二月八日友邦本發動大東亞戰爭以來、國民政府立即聲明決與友邦日本同甘共苦、　那時候就有好些同志、尤其武裝同志、主張應該進一步實行參戰、其主張是光明正大的、這一次戰爭、是東亞戰爭、中國是東亞的一部份、所以中國參戰是當然的、比起重慶方面、做英美的走狗、出兵緬印、反噬東亞同胞、順逆之辨、眞是天淵之隔、</p>
<p>有些人以爲中國現在論起國力民力、都够不上參戰、何必有參戰之名、而無其實、這話是不對的、中國所應該有的是決心、所應該表明的是立塲、中國是東亞一部分、中國應該站在保衛東亞的方面、和侵略東亞以及甘心做東亞叛逆的作正反對、况且決心旣定、立塲旣定、國力民力自然不斷的增長起來、使用於保衛束亞的上面、決不是祗有參戰之名、而無其實、又有些人、以爲這些年來、和平運動是以和平爲號召、如今參戰、豈不是矛盾、這話更不對、和平運動發軔之始、就是根據國父的大亞洲主義、響應友邦日本建設東亞新秩序的主張、所謂和平是指中日兩國將以往的糾紛、根本掃除、重新結合陸鄉友好的關係、各愛其國、互愛其鄰、共愛東亞、以同心同德、達到共存共榮、決不是什麽因循姑息、偷安苟活、可以混充和平兩字、所以到了大東亞戰爭時候、中國由與友邦日本同甘共苦、進一步而以同生共死的決心、來參加戰爭、正是始終一貫的主張、然則友邦日本、在先何以沒有贊成中國參戰的表示呢、這是極易明白的、自從大東亞戰爭發　以來、友邦日本、是以獨力打破英美的勢力、陸海軍掃蕩的結果、使英美在東太平洋、南洋的兵力受到了摧毀、其侵略東亞的根據地也隨以摧毀、數月之內、美屬菲律濱羣島、英屬馬來羣島緬甸、荷屬東印度羣島、都次第被友邦日本所佔領、友邦日本旣然以獨力發動戰爭、並目支持戰爭、所盼望於中國的、是本於保衛束亞的意義、以同甘共苦的精神、來協助一切、並不盼望中國於連年凋敝之餘、提出參戰的問題、以引起一部份人的懷疑、甚至爲重慶方面所藉口、</p>
<p>然則友邦日本、現在何以贊成中國的參戰呢、因為自從前年十二月八日、大東亞戰爭開始以來、中國對於同甘共苦的聲明、努力實踐新國民運動的發起在學校的靑少年、以及一般勤勞靑少年的訓練、尤其是中央陸軍將校訓練團、以及海軍高級講習班的種種訓練、國民政府統治下的民衆及軍隊對於大東亞戰爭的意義、及中國本身的責任、已有了充分的瞭解、有了充分的決心和自覺重慶方面、做英美的走狗、東亞的叛逆、其挑撥離問的手段、也早已人人睡棄、中國由同甘共苦的聲明、進一步而實行參戰、巳臻於水到渠成的地位了、去年十二月廿二日，兄弟在東京晤見東條總理大臣、</p>
<p>有幾句最緊要的話、東亞有十萬萬民衆、這種數量、是世界上任何集團國家所沒有的、有了這種數量、再加以團結、大東亞戰爭最後勝利的獲得、大東亞共榮圈的確立、有絕對把握、」這幾句最要緊的話、說明了一切、所謂團結、便是以東亞同胞爲東亞同志、各愛其國、互愛其鄰、共愛東亞、這種團結的力量、是沒有做不到的事、</p>
<p>各位武裝同志、聽了以上的話、定有以下的兩種感想、其一、是我們現在的國力民力、還是很薄弱的、其二、是我們的團結、是很重要的、團結就是力量、有了這兩種感想、我們便可檢討、參戰期問我們應有的努力了、</p>
<p>第一、有些武裝同志、主張挑選軍隊、運往前綫、稍分友邦將士的勞苦、同時稍盡自己的心力、這種主張非常値得贊美的、可是我要叮囑一句話、前　責任、固然重大、後方責任、也同樣重大、中國處在大東亞戰爭的後方、而在這後力、有重慶的不肖份子、甘心作英美的走狗、東亞的叛逆、有共匪的擾亂、而我們的軍事力量、還沒有健全、隨時隨處發現缺點、迄不僅是國民政府所痛心疾首、也是友邦所苦心焦慮的、我們能保障後方的治安、就是能分友邦前綫將士的勞苦、使之無後顧之憂、這與在前綫分勞苦、　沒有軒　、所以我們在參戰期間、最要努力的、是保障地方治安、這所謂地方、是中國生命之根源、如樹之有根、水之有源、中國以農立國、還未發達至現代工業社會的程度、所以他的生命、不是和現代工業社會集中在都市、而是散布在農村地、我們所要爭的、不只是「點」「綫」、而尤其是「商」、我们對於已得的地方、能加以保障、對於未得的地方、怎樣纔能加以展拓、國力民力、怎樣纔能增進呢、要人人能從事增加生產、生產怎樣纔　增加呢、要人民能安居樂業、怎樣纔能安居樂業呢、要能保障地方治安、我們如果知道現在的國力民力、還是很薄弱、我们就更应該知道我们的努力所在、</p>
<p>第二、兄弟常常和武裝同志說、我們要和友邦同甘共苦、先要自己能同甘共苦、要和友邦同生共死、先要自己能同生共死、一是我們怎樣對民衆、我們必須知道我們親民衆如腹心、民衆才視我們如手足、我們必須確　做到國父所垂示的兩句話、第一步武力與民衆結合、第二步武力爲民衆的的武力、一是我們怎樣對自己的袍澤、現在我們所有的部隊、都是幾年以來集合而成的、各有各的歷史、各有各的環境、這一層我深深　會、可是我們要成為民衆的武力、國家的軍隊、我們便不可不打破地域的觀念、前天全國經濟委員會開全體會議、有一件議決案、是極重要的、便是打破地域觀念、形成經濟統一、這是經濟復興的第一關鍵、經濟如此、軍事尤其必然、我們武裝同志、萬不可只顧着自己駐紮的地方、以及自己的部隊系統、須知無論那一塊的地方、都是中華民國的地方、譬如全身之內、一處痛、全身痛、一處受病全身受病、萬不可有隔膜的、至於部隊如果認爲是民衆的、國家的、那就只有一個系統、沒有零星系統之可言、這不但是國軍的正理、並且是精兵　要義、沒有零星系統的部隊、而可以長久存在的、即使偶然得志於一時、終必歸於消滅、我們必須努力、使我們的心血以及一切熱血、都深入民衆國家的裏面、成爲一個有力的細胞、決不可使之離民衆國家而存在、以上兩件必須做到、一是與民衆同甘共苦、同生同死、一是我們袍澤向同甘共苦同生共死、必須這樣、才能與友邦同甘共苦、同生共死、以爭取大東亞戰爭的勝利、</p>
<p>第三、我們的口號、是復興中華、保衛東亞、這兩件事、是一件事、我們不能復興中華、決沒有能力來分擔保衛東亞的責任、而東亞保衛責任、復興中華才有保障、這是極明顯的道理、一月九日我們宣佈加大東亞戰爭、同日友邦日本與我們締結協定、交還租界、及撤廢治外法權、這是證明我們願意分擔保衛東亞的責任、友邦日本也愿意援助我們完成復興中華的使命、這並不是交換條件、而是心理的交流、目的之一致、我們武裝同志看見這樣、必須更加堅定了決心、鼓起了勇氣、一直向前不達目的不止、可是我們不可不注意友邦這種尊重我國主義、援助我國完成獨立的表示、我們可認爲我們平日的信念、有了實現的證據、而益加欣慰、益加奮發、我們却不可因此而一發出一一種虛榮觀念、我們現在沒有一點可以自負的地方、不但我們對於大東亞戰爭、自顧國民力如此薄弱、要怎樣振作、繼能分担得起一些責任、便是我們對於國家復興、也還在茫無頭緒、萬分掙扎之中、如果我們對於友邦將士及共他人士沒有虛心坦懷、沒有熱誠、沒有誠意、那麼我們要把和平運一動以來、艱難辛苦培養出來的根芽、像暴風雨般摧殘凈盡、我常常以謙恭自重四字、勉勵自己、勉勵各位武裝同志、謙恭是對於先進國應有的態度、自重是自己應有的努力、不努力只是謙恭、沒有用的、越努力越知道自己之不是、那種謙恭、纔是誠意的謙恭、</p>
<p>以上三點，是參戰期間兄弟所以自勉及互勉的、難得武裝同志共聚一堂、兄弟謹祝各位武裝同志的健康、並希望在會議中充分發揮集思廣益的效能、爲復興中華保衛東亞有更大的貢獻、</p>

<p>關於國府財政、大體上本年度上半期（一月至六月）情形已可明瞭、上半期預算每月爲九千萬元、比較去年度有相當增加、稅收方面亦繼續順利增加、故預料僅賴稅收亦可足敷支出、因之上半期並發行公債計書、去年度所轉入之剩餘金、亦達相當多數、此亦決定不轉入本期預算、支出方面、凡充實戰力及擴充生產力所需之支出、預料當將增加、然如無預定以外之大宗臨時支出、則將不再增稅、因之在目前對於提高現行稅率或賦課新稅均未考慮及之</p>
<p>金融通貨物價問題</p>
<p>中儲券現與軍票係以十八圓之比率互相連繫、靑木大東亞大臣、前已說明此十八圓之比率絕對不予變更、將來軍票收回後、與軍票有等價關係之日圓、與中儲券之比率、亦認爲將決定爲十八圓、此無論對於中國日本　　最爲有利、由日本與中國之物價水準準而觀、十八圓之比率雖有多少勉強、然在大東亞戰爭下之重大時期、應不予變更、貿易結算、所使用之特別圓制度之運用、正就與日近將設立之交易營團之關係加以硏究、特別圓之比率與以上十八圓之比率並無關係、中儲券與聯銀券之關係、則與中儲券對日圓情形不同、應另行決定、即目前中儲券對聯銀券之比率爲三十元、（匯申匯兌）如不妥當、則應根據兩通質之實質價値重行決定兩相適應之新比率、此則應與中儲券對日圓之十八圓比率另行考慮、因之中儲券對日圓之比率與中儲券對聯銀券之比率可生差異、此與聯銀券對日圓等價之原則實相矛盾、然在戰時下金融方面之此種矛盾、實非得已也、</p>
<p>中儲券發行增加後、確立其收回方策、此在通貨政策實最爲重要、國府方面早已開始研究、決於最近付之實施、其主要者如次、</p>
<p>一、發行糧食庫券、此事業已準備完後、故即可發行、將糧食庫券出售於一般後、當可收回相富數量之中儲券</p>
<p>二、有獎儲蓄制之實施、此爲中國久已實行之制度、即附有獎金之儲蓄也、此項有獎儲蓄、將使在中央儲備銀行指導下實施之、</p>
<p>三、彩票之發行、此亦爲中國久已實行之方法、目前在滿洲及華北頗有發行、此種發行彩票方法對於吸收資金亦屬有效、故國府亦正在加以研究中、</p>
<p>以上收回資金方策、同時亦具有維持中儲券作値方策之效果、維持中儲券價値上最爲重要者、即係安定物價、在中國實施物價對策有種種困難、目下所決定方針、乃係由日方之商工會議所、華方之市商會以及其他商業　　與中日兩當局作充分協議、以使民間團體徹底協力物價對策、生產之增强與物資交流之促進、爲抑制物價之根本原則、固不待言、在戰爭下之今日、增強生產實有頗多困難、惟國府方面以就力之所及、努力增强生產爲方針、目下正在進行研究、擬採用內地生產之物資爲原料、復活上海方面之停閉工廠、以促進上海與內地之物資交流、同時並促進華中華北間之物資交流、以圖由華北方面增多移入煤斤及原料爲方針、</p>
<p>移管敵產之處理運用</p>
<p>關於移管敵產之處理、國民政府前已設立敵產管理委員會、今後將根據向日方接收之先後、逐一個別處理、至具體的處理機關、決在上海設立敵產管理委員會辦事處、有人主張一部份移管敵產、應交與中央儲備銀行此亦頗有見地、蓋此確可使中儲行之基礎、因之更形强化也、</p>
<p>全國經濟委員會　之運用方針</p>
<p>全國經濟委員會、於國府參戰後、加入華中華北方面經濟界有力鉅子、機構爲之强化、第一次全體會議、已於十二十三兩日舉行、中國經濟界鉅子與汪主席等國府要人共聚一堂、即就此點而言、亦已具有偉大效果、今後或將每二月舉行一次、以促進國府與上海財界之運繫關係、國府方面、亦決定今後對於重要政策、將先徴取全國經濟委員會之意見後、再行正式決定云、</p>

<p>政治力加強</p>
<p>自大東亞戰爭爆發以來，國民政府則與日本同甘共苦，罄物資與精神之所有，協助完成戰爭使命；澈底展開各種施策，致日本主要兵站基地成爲金湯之固。爲適應帝國過去一年中的戰爭偉蹟，則示百尺竿頭更進一步的決心，而宣佈與帝國同生共死；爲充分發揮完成戰爭的協力，則展開全面的自强政策，而逐漸形成戰鬥體系。同時，此次國民政府表示最後的決心，面對英美宣戰；由於中國竚立在新形勢的當前，而中日關係也隨着邁人新的階段。即與國民政府參戰佈吿同時，日本政府則與國民政府發表相互協助完成戰爭的共同宣誓；中日兩國在進行共同戰爭的軍事，政治，經濟等各方面，宣佈整個協力諾言，同時日本則根據中國自主獨立與發揮國民政府本身政治力的基本原則，爲求迅速建設新中國，而締結中日協定，放棄在華一一切專管租界，撤消治外法權。共同戰綫一員的中國，對外關係業已明朗化，正積極執行戰爭任務與協力大東亞建設；日本對此，決定爲適應新形勢而重新建立中日關係，充分着意支持新中國的建設。</p>
<p>在這一點上，中國的自主獨立，實質上已進入實踐階段：國民政府本身的政治力，也劃時代的加强了。向來未臻强固的國民政府基礎，一變而爲强大鞏固，全部表現出獨立政府的輪廓，與精力，由於澈底瞭解此種自主性與政治力，才能有效地推行對英美作戰的各種戰時政策。因此國民政府才能集中民力於鮮明的旗幟下，動員全部物資與精神執行戰爭任務，才能澈底完成保衛大東亞的使命，才能有效地展開物資方面的淸鄉工作，精神方面的新國民運動。如此，藉發揮國民政府的政治力，而中國物資與精神總動員才能構成雄厚戰力的基礎，這是日本最關心的一點。同甘共苦與同生共死的中日關係，從此澈底展間，這已是不言而喩的。</p>
<p>中國宣佈參戰後，國民政府首先求奠定戰時體系，而努力於發揮有效的政治力。設立最高國防會議，改革國府行政機構，即在於此。最高國防會議構成爲國民政府戰時體系底核心；爲適應戰時需要，一切軍事政治，經濟等方策，皆由以汪主席爲首的該會議決定；面重新建立戰時國民政府今後國內體系的動向，亦頗堪注意。此外，國府行政機構的改革，當然即是加强國民政府的戰時體系，一切力量集中於行政院，俾發揮高度的效率，且為明確責任所屬計，而力求事務底簡捷。如是，戰時下之軍政兩方面，可以迅速而妥當地應付千變萬化的戰局，此即達到國民政府政治力普遍深入的發揮。</p>
<p>設立最高國防會議</p>
<p>最高國防會議直轄於決定國策的最高機關中央政治委員會（主席爲注精衛氏），乃決定戰時重要國策事項的最高機關，最高國防會議每週一次（必要時舉行臨時會議）在每月一次舉行的中央委員會閉會期間，則代行其職權，而决定事項則相機報告中央政治委員會，實質上，最高國防會議乃代行中央政治委員會職權的機關，而中央政治委員會乃最高國防會議事項決定後的報吿管理機關。其構成人員則綱　軍政方面中樞人材，俾軍政兩方面的連絡緊密化與有機化，同時決定華北政務委員會委員長亦參加，必要時地方軍政長官亦得參加，藉求中央與地方的連　有機化。同時，上述成立最高國防會議外，中央政治委員會爲適應戰時緊急事態，而仍保特現行各種法令效力的停止權，此外，緊急法令改爲不經立法院而直接送交政府執行，藉以擴大中央政治委員會權限，冀求政務方面的簡捷化。最高國防會議也以中央政治委員會主席爲主席。</p>
<p>行政機構大改革</p>
<p>國民政府行政機構的改革，在第一次最高國防會議時，決定而發表了。其目的在改組行政院，以求責任分明外；更側重於事務簡捷化，以求政務效率的高度發揮；取消向來行政院內的各種委員會，以求淘汰各部中過剩人員。同時各部職員人數，雖不必一律相等，但委員會旣隸屬於部，則規定不得超過前此委員會時代的人數。即</p>
<p>（一），行政院隸屬之全國經濟委員會，改爲國民政府直屬。</p>
<p>（二），新國民運動促進委員會，由行政院改爲國民政府直屬。</p>
<p>（三），考試院銓叙部改隸於有政院。</p>
<p>（四），社會運動指　委員會與賑務委員會合併，改爲社會福利部。</p>
<p>（五），糧食管理委員會改爲糧食部，司全國食糧分　及增加生產事宜。</p>
<p>（六），邊疆委員會改爲邊疆局，隸屬於內務部。</p>
<p>（七），僑務委員會改爲僑務局，隸屬於外交都。</p>
<p>（八），水利委員會與交通部合併，新設建設部，管理全國水利及交通都市建設等事宜。</p>
<p>於是向來的五院十部，成爲五院十三部，行政院所屬各部爲外交，內政，宣傳，敎育，財政，實業，社會福利，建設，糧食，司法行政，銓叙等十一部，外有陸海軍兩部直屬於軍事委員會。此外，廢除行政院的參事廳長與法制局長，而改爲秘書長一人，副秘書長二人；一變向來各部長下的政務次長與常務次長制度，而爲次長一人；爲錄取人材計，各部內設立三人或五人搆成之委員會，以資部長之諮詢與建議</p>
<p>前隸屬於考試院的銓叙部改隸於行政院者，當然是由於深感戰時下官吏銓叙的重要性；新設建設，糧食，社會福利等三部者，乃安定民生與增進福祉，爲强化國民政府與培養戰力所不可缺者。全國經濟委員會，因爲必須管理今後生產力擴充，經濟開發，物資徴集與分配，物價對策，中日經濟合作等重要問題，所以由行政院劃出，而讓政府直轄，此乃承認經濟對策之絕對重要性，以備今後之靈活運用。新國民運動促進委“會現歸政府直轄者，因爲新國民運動今後必須名實相符，迅速具體化，俾民衆生活澈底適應戰時要求，强調其重要性。因此，五院中除掉行政院，而立法，司法，考試，監察，等四院權限逐漸縮小；戰時政治推進力的重心則集中於中央政治委員會，最高國防會議及行政院等。</p>
<p>政治體系的變動</p>
<p>再次，檢討一下國民政府南京還都以來，政治機構改組的歷史。民國二十九年三月國民政府南京還都時，曾擁有五院十四部和各種委員會等的龐大行政機構。</p>
<p>然而此種行政機構，施行一年以來，於前年七月，第一次的改組，而成爲五院十部制，當時曾實現了以國民黨員爲核心的人事更動。但距離戰時行政機構的水準尙遠。同年十二月，爆發大東亞戰爭，國民政府聲明同甘共苦與保衛後方，立即担負起服務大東亞戰爭後方，維持地方治安的重大任務；關於這一點，去年八月曾澈底大事改革軍事機構，終於實現了由平時姿態轉向戰時姿態的體系。陸海軍兩部劃歸軍事委員會直轄，在汪委員長絕對權保持下，設總參謀長，一面加强軍令與軍政底統一，一面澈底縮减眾事機構人員，實行人事方面甯缺毌濫主義，適材適所主義，如是充分表現出各方面的臨戰姿態，繼上述軍事機構改革，而行政機構戰時再編制，當然是不可避免的事，由去年秋天開始，關於行政機構戰時姿態化問題，中日兩方面曾提出各種改革案，因此行政改革已成爲遲早必行的問題，另外，由於日本政府設立大東亞省後，造成在華各地機關之一元化，以求加强協助國民政府，決定推進普遍深入的中日合作方針，緊接着去年底，在主席第二次訪日，於是此次行政機構的改革，藉參戰機緣，而確立了國民政府戰鬥姿態。在軍事，政治，經濟等各方面，建立了對日全面協力的國民政府行政的戰鬥機構，爲完成大東亞戰爭任務，以求勇往邁進。（濤·譯自一月二十日經濟學者）</p>
<h3 id="c20">華北的戰時政體 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>「北京特電八日發」華北政務委員會委員長之更迭、及各督辦之調動，爲適應中國參戰後之新事態，由於華北的建設，更進而促進新中國的建設，乃於委員淸新潑刺之朝氣，同時，亦可視為少數精銳主義之政治機構，故意義至爲重大。</p>
<p>上月九日，中國之參戰，具有歷史的意義，自日華共同宣言並協定發表以來，爲使華北政治力有飛躍之進展，當然有待於華北政務委員會之强化。王前委員長經二年餘之努力，建設華北之功績斐然可觀，乃急流勇退，而新理想中之華北政務委員會新陣營於以出現，於參戰中國之歷史階段前，對朱深委員長等如何發揮其手段，期望頗深。</p>
<p>因中國參戰，日華一體之關係更爲强化，同時，亦進一步加深。國民政府對華北政務委員會之關係，華北方面之參與全國經濟委員及新國民運動促進會，汪主席之就任新民會名譽會長，廢止五色旗等，中央與華北間許多懸案均急速加以調整　華北之實力，加入國民政府而發生密切　繫後，中國戰時態度之確立愈見進展，同時在華北地帶，爲適應日華新關係，擬使華北政務委員會有更飛躍之擴充强化，處茲決戰階段，如欲完成確立治安，作爲大東亞兵站基地之重要使命，則不能不發揮强有力的政治力量，故整頓機構，行政各部門情勢之調整，以及其他具體方策均有賴於朱深委員長　任後急速實現。</p>

<p>市長訓詞</p>
<p>「親愛的民眾同胞們、今天我們在行將收回的公共租界跑馬廳、舉行中華民國對英美宣戰的示威大會、我深信各位必定感覺無窮興奮和愉快的、國民政府爲什麽要對英美宣戰、內為他們是最先侵略中國的帝國主義者、中國之渝為次殖民地、中國喪失許多土地和國權、甚至於中華民族受着國際的不平待遇和歧視、都是英美為厲之階的、今天參加這個示威大會的諸位、除了記得領土主權的損失、都應該記得中國人以前不能踏入外灘公園、前年十二月八日以前、還不能上今天跑馬廳的看台、還不能被邀請至外灘的俱樂部、我們為着正義、為着良心、為着尊嚴、為着國權、所以毅然對英美宣戰、國民政府爲什麽對英美宣戰、因為日本已於前年十二月八日揭義旗、展開大東亞戰爭、這個戰爭是為着解放全東亞而戰爭的、是為着東亞共榮存而戰爭的、我們是大東亞的一員、應該參加這次歷史上最有意義的解放大業、我們要和日本永遠合作和携手、來保衛東亞、更應該協力邁進、以完成建設大東亞的目的、我們為着正義、為着良心、為着友誼、為着責任、所以毅然對英美宣戰、國民政府為什麽對英美宣戰、自從大東亞戰爭展開以後、全國人民、都興奮異常、無論是政府的官吏、無論是農工商婦女學生、不斷向政府表示參戰的希望、不斷期待人盡其力以貢獻於解放的戰爭、人同此心、心同此想、我們正義、良心、民意、天職、所以毅然對英美宣傳、中國已經宣戰了、我們今後怎樣做、</p>
<p>我們趕快組織和訓練民眾、中國以前爲什麽那樣衰弱、因為民眾沒有健全的組織、沒有堅強的訓練、所以易為帝國主義者所壓迫和欺騙、一百年來、我們所受的痛苦太深了、一個主義、一個領袖、來組織、來訓練、確保後方的治安、更應該準備隨時出發前方、參加這次歷史上的大戰爭、我們更趕快確保和增加生產、現在的戰爭是總體戰、更是人力和物力的總體戰、戰塲有前方後方之分、而戰爭是沒有前方後方之分的、我們確保生產、就是確保戰爭的勝利、我們增加生產、就是增加戰爭的力量、我們準備以人力參加戰爭、尤其立刻增加物力以貢獻於戰爭、各位親　的同胞們、我們這次宣戰、是為着正義、為着良心、為着尊嚴、為着國權、為着友誼、為着責任、為着民意、為着天職、我們絕不希望報酬、更不要求條件、如果希望報酬和條件、全東亞的解放和自由就是我們的報酬和條件、我們感謝日本義大利各友邦交回租界和撤銷治外法權、但我們決不要求、我們祗是希望能夠以人力物力貢獻於大東亞戰爭、以盡我們的天職和責任、我們要復興中華、唯有打倒英美、我們要保衛東亞、唯有和日本協力、我們一心一意、從事戰爭罷、我們勇往邁進罷、」</p>

<p>日本大使館上海事務所田　公使致詞原文、「今天敝人能在這百年來英美侵略東亞最大根據地的上海、親自看到中國十萬同志高呼打倒英美擁護參戰的熱烈情緒、同時感到英美在東亞的根據地已完全被我東亞民族覆滅、敝人對此、不禁有　　的感慨、回想歷來中日兩國的友好關係、　親　關係、因為有英美橫霸東亞的野心而妨礙了中日兩國國民的相互理解及友好關係的樹立、大東亞戰爭爆發以後、英美的野心已經被粉碎了、阻撓中日友好的英美已被我們驅逐、又這次　民政府的參戰、中日兩國的關係、事實上已成為戰友而站在利害相關的命運上、現在、正式中日兩國駢肩努力實現「大亞細亞主義」理想的機會到了、</p>

<p>南洋各地特輯之二（上）</p>
<h3 id="c28">大東亞的寶庫南洋 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— 選民</p>
<p>英美帝國主義勢力開始在太平洋上的總退却，南洋各國開始擺脫三百年來屈辱的命運，在「民族自決」的最高原則之下、準備為自己的命運而描寫未來的南洋新歷史。</p>
<p>一般情況</p>
<p>現代意義的南洋，不是地理學上的南洋，而是與中日兩國在政治上經濟上具有密切關係的南洋，這裏應該包含舊荷領東印度，菲律賓，舊英領馬萊，英領婆羅洲，泰國，法領印度支郡—越南及散佈西南太平洋上的熱帶諸島。</p>
<p>（按，地理學上的南洋，係指西自阿非利加洲東部海岸，東至南亞美利加洲西部海岸，總括熱帶領域的全部海岸。）</p>
<p>南洋總面積約為三百八十二萬平方公里，比日本（包括台灣，朝鮮，樺太在內）全面積六十八萬平方公里計，多約五　半：與全中國總面積一千二百零四萬二千九百七十三平方公里，約佔三分之一。而全部人口，共約一億三千萬，較日本總人口（一九三五年調查）九千八百萬而有過之，較中國總人口（一九三三年內政部統計月報）四億八千九百十五萬五千三百八十九人，亦約佔三分之一；但從人口密度來看，南洋每一平方公里人口僅為三三。九七，與我國之每平方公里約有四十人以上，所差無幾，不過，像我國一樣，南洋人口密度也，不平衡，例如人口稠密的爪哇，每一平方公里約達三一三人；而鄰近的蘇門答臘則僅為一人；西里伯斯則　二二，舊荷領婆羅洲為四，而舊荷領新幾內亞為一，由此可見尚有廣大地區，未經開發。</p>
<p>茲將南洋各國面積，人口，密度與中日兩國比較如下：南洋各國一般的說，都是農業國家，不過錫及其他鑛物咨源也非常豐富，所以工業化的條件是早已具備的，此外林業，漁業也都相當發達。</p>
<p>農產資源</p>
<p>南洋各國的農業，由於強烈的日光與豐富的雨量，加以土壤的肥沃，具備有栽培農產的最優越的條件，例如米穀，及數地區都可一年三獲。試觀最近數年各國主要農產數之生產量，其輸出數占世界生產額的比率如下：</p>
<p>橡膠以馬來及東印度為中心產地，占全世界總生產最百分之九十，南洋各地橡膠產額，可表列如下：（單位公噸）</p>
<p>南洋橡膠，在一九二九年以後，因為年產過剩，價格大跌，頻於破產，一九三四年設立國除橡膠調查委員會，規定生產各國基本生產數量，輸出許可量等，不用說，這是完全在有利於幾個強國的條件下的不公平的辦法：</p>
<p>南洋砂糖生產地為東印度及菲律賓，越南有小規模的砂糖生產，泰國近年也有新興氣象，荷印及菲律賓產糖量與世界總產量的比例如下：（單位千公擔）</p>
<p>南洋各地，遍產椰子，椰子乾的輸出，佔全世界總輸出額七五％，油椰子産於馬來及東印度，各地椰子　產輸出量如下：（單位千公擔）</p>
<p>世界奎寗生產，事實上以東印度及英領印度為主，幾佔全部，南洋生產量與世界生產對比如下：（單位公燉　千公斤）</p>
<p>南洋各地所產的硬質織維，是馬拉麻等，產地以菲律賓為主，北　羅洲及蘇門答臘，東印度各項也有相當大量出產，各地硬質　維的輸出量在世界輸出量佔地位如下表：（單位一千公噸）</p>
<p>木棉未次於橡膠的南洋重要農業資源，供給世界消費之大部份，輸出量在世界之地位可閱下表：（單位公噸——千公斤）</p>
<p>米為亞洲人主要食物，而南洋米產之豐富，也不容忽視，越南泰國產米的輸出量，尤可驚人，各地生產量如下：（單位千公斤擔）</p>
<p>此外，如咖啡，茶，烟草等南洋產量如下：</p>

<p>查本年度經常收入預算之編製方法、與上年度大致相同、各項收入、大多從少估計、藉以適應將來稅收方面發生可能的不順利情形、茲將各項收入、摘要說明如次、</p>
<p>（一）地稅　參照上表、本年度地稅收入、計列二〇·七〇七·〇〇〇元、本年度地稅仍按地產估價征收二厘半、與上年下半年度相同、局產及免稅之業產、不許在內、作為征税據之地、產估價、仍沿用上年度估價、新估價目前暫緩實施、本年度此項收入預算、少估二成、藉為稅收萬一發生不順利情形時留一餘地、</p>
<p>（二）西式房屋市政總捐（房捐）</p>
<p>此項收入、本年估計為二三·二五〇·〇〇〇元、捐率仍為西式房屋房租估價之五成、局產免捐　產、以及不生產的房屋、均不計在內、作為收捐根據之房租估價、與上年相同、並無　動、新估價暫緩實施、本年度此項收入、少估三成、藉為稅收萬一發生不順利情形時留一餘地、</p>
<p>（三）華式房屋市政總捐（房捐）</p>
<p>此項收入、本年度計列一五·五七五·〇〇〇元、關於征收辦法、與西式房屋相同、收入總數、少估二成半、</p>
<p>（四）市政特捐　此項收入、計列一六一·〇〇〇元、其中西式房屋計為一六〇·〇〇〇元、華式房屋計為一·〇〇〇元、因收捐範圍、祗限於鐵路綫以外之區域、故收入總額、比其他各項預算遜色多多、</p>
<p>（五）特別廣告捐　此項收入、計列一二五·〇〇〇元、比上年度預算增加四五·〇〇〇元、所以增加之原因、厥為捐率之提高也、</p>
<p>（六）碼頭捐　此項收入殊難逆料、須視商業情形而定、本年度計列二五〇·〇〇〇元、純為名義上之數額、</p>
<p>（七）執照費　本年度此項收入、計列一五·六六二·九〇〇元、各項執照費收入有賴於本埠工商業之活動情形、不能全視去年之收入狀況而定、故預算之編製方法、與上年相同、</p>
<p>（八）局產租金收入　本年度此項收入、計列二·二五〇·〇〇〇元、船隻使用本局外灘浮碼頭之納費、為本款項下最大之收入、其餘部份　為估計局產如屠宰塲等之較高租金收入、</p>
<p>（九）公用及局辦事業收入　本年度此項收入計列、一二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、其中大部份為　公用事業公司所繳特許營業費、但滬西電力公司之特許營業費、現已改向該區關係當局繳納、故不計在內、其餘部份為兩租界電車公司所繳　　程等　、以及局辦事業之預算收入、</p>
<p>（十）娛樂捐　此項收入本年度計列九·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、捐率仍為三成、與以往相同、</p>

<p>— 容平</p>
<p>上海需要真正適合職業界人士與學生的圖書館。申報讀者週及全市，設立圖書館，最為相宜。茲特提出幾點，供各界參考：</p>
<p>（一）命名申報讀者圖書館，以紀念申報對於社會之供獻。</p>
<p>（二）設立經費，用捐款方法，最好由申報仿助基金辦法努力在報端向各界闡揚建立本圖書館之重要性，則熱心可敬的捐款者一定是極多的。全部收入由申報社會服務處請社會上真正的公道人士組會保管處理，賬目及捐款者台　，在申報上特關一圖書消息欄公布。凡捐款三十元以上者贈有效期一年之借書證一紙，五十元以上送有效期二年之借書證一張，百元以上三年，二百元以上則長期。</p>
<p>（三）不捐款者欲入館，可捐書三冊以上（至少七成新）價格超過二十五元，書價照該書版權頁定價分之百五十計。（所發給之借書證有效期為一年，價在四十元上者其借書證有效期為二年，八十元以上三年，一百五十元以上長期）。各捐書者台　及書名，作者，出版者均公佈於申報圖書館消息欄，以便未加入者捐書時避免同一冊書之再行捐助。（所捐若為英文書，暫限一冊）各書須經館員審查，館員認為不合格時，有權拒絕收受，但凡正式有益之書籍，尤其是一切小工業，農業（包括園藝，畜牧，果蔬，造林等），及必要的醫藥常識，科學知識等皆為合格。</p>
<p>（四）以後欲加入本館而或無書可捐者，得應用一條所列之捐款方法。至於勞工，茶役，學徒等等階級中有志上進者，欲加入本館，本館當然最是歡迎，但他們大多不具有第一或第二條之能力，即既無錢又並無書者，那麼他們入館之辦法如何，亦應酌　之。</p>
<p>（五）現在保甲事業辦得很好，個人來蹤去跡一查即瞭如指掌，所以欲加入者必先填具入館登記表，表上寫明：市民證號數，姓名，籍貫，年齡，住址，保甲區，職業（類別及地點或校名及校址），另黏照一片一紙於表上，由館員查核與市民證無誤者方為合格。如此既不必要保人，也不怕人搗蛋。最好　保甲辦事處與圖書館方面合作，以應付對於利用遷居或離滬等機會以吞沒書籍者。</p>
<p>（六）開放時間為每日下午四時至九時，星期日及一切例假日均全天開放，星期六則自下午一時至九時，以便學生職員有充分換書時間。</p>
<p>（七）每次暫定借書二冊，待以後書籍多時加至三冊或四冊，時間為十天，不得延期，到期未　完　可　期十日，否則每日科以罰金一角，罰金掃數充作本館基金。</p>
<p>（八）仿工部局公共圖書館例，借書者可入館自擇，中意者即可取來借回，不必開具取書紙等。借出各書宜善自珍護，有損壞及遺失者由館員酌情罰金或賠償新書。為避免糾紛計，館外物件及書籍等一概不得帶入館內。</p>
<p>（九）本館有事要通知各借書人時，除於館內張貼公告外，並在申報圖書館消息欄揭露。</p>
<p>（十）至於館員則由申報社會服務組會登報通告考試選拔，有任本館員之志者，可向該處報名應試。薪金由捐款內提取，故館員不能太多，約四人則足。待館員聘定後，由社會服務處請圖書館界有經騐者會同本館館長（選館員中之最佳者任之）找尋及布　館址、一切當用由捐款內提取。</p>
<h3 id="c46">致申請助學諸君一封公開的信 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— 助學金辦事處同人</p>
<p>吾親愛的諸同學公鑒，申報讀者助學金舉辦以來，於茲四屆，今當本屆助學工作　告段落之際，諸同學重入　舍之日，有願為諸同學一言者，謹縷述之：</p>
<p>本屆助學金，於一月十五日開始申請登記，迄二月十四日，將小學·初·高中·大學·工商各組，分別核准公布為止；於一個月間，獲各界三十餘萬元之助金，承助學金委員會聖約翰大學沈嗣良校長，工部局華人教育處長陳青士先生，世界書局總經理陸高誼先生，工部局女中校長聶靈瑜女士，職業教育家趙宗預先生之指導，　同人五十餘人之棉力，始畢二千六百餘申請學生之甄審；同人自維　材，　對諸同學之成績品行家境，　經秉承委員會之命，　方查核，本同情學今日所應珍視者，即社會各界或節約　學，或　　斥責，此種至高無上之同情心，應為諸同學　品　學之光榮的鞭策。</p>
<p>（甲）本屆申請助學登記人數，計小學五年　四〇七人，小學六年級三五四人，初中一四六六人，初中二、三七三人，初中三、三一一人，高中一、一六二人，高中二、一五二人，高中三、一一三人，大學一九九人，工商五人。（乙）本屆核准發給助學金計小學五年級三一〇人，小學六年級二〇九人，初中一、二〇九人，初中二、一五八人，初中三、一八〇人，高中一、八五人，高中二、九六人·高中三、八二人，大學一　七人，　　　四人，其中讀友　　　者，尙未列入，應該本屆助學　　時，再行公表統計數字。（丙）本屆核准　　助學計小學四七二二〇五，初中七五一九八七二二〇五，初中七五一九八元，高中四九七三五元，大學四一五八九元，工商四一四一元，共二一七八八三元。此係至十二日未止之已發助金數額，此後續有覆核撥助，當再行正式公告。</p>
<p>查閱申請人數與核准名單，大部分均已獲助，一部分正在覆核，謹行同人甄審之標準，以告諸君，兼就教於各界；竊申報讀者助學金，旨在濟助清寒優秀學生，既不同於純慈善事業，亦非一般獎學性質，故由請諸君中，有未付此項標準者，未　　　，品性端正者，成績　優秀者，　次畢業者，學習　　，　　　　　　，今日諸君所　　　過，一方面　　報社會於　日，一方面當刻苦造就於此時，孟子所　，勞其筋骨餓其體　，顏回　食瓢飲不改其樂，此為諸君所應身體力行者也；論語「古之學者為已，今之學者為人；」此為諸君應具之抱負；「修已不得不　，為學不得不堅；」此為諸君學行方面應受致　錬。</p>
<p>至覆核准助諸君，其考試成績，比較低落，同人念其助理家務時間之多，自修機會之少，不為覆核，勢將失學，用是重加考選，酌為撥助，冀其下屆成績，得有進步。</p>
<p>此外，落選諸君當關心於落選之原因，謹為說明：（一）經　查證明家境尚可者；（二）在校成績太差，本屆助金考試又不及格者；（三）品性不佳，或在校受　　處分者；（四）申請而未參　考試者；　手續不定備，跡近故意疏忽者；（六）　填表與事實不符者；（七）曾在他處已領助金者。其中凡與本報助學金章程　觸者，自屬無　核辦，至學行較次諸君，雖經此次甄審落選，仍無妨其下次申請之資格，果能力自振奮，下期成績，必有可觀，同人甚願於此作一比較，於下屆有以慰諸君之望。</p>
<p>當此時艱未已，萬方多難，明日社會之復興，端賴今日之青年，培訓扶助，人人有此責任與義務；同人懷見義不為之誡，秉人類互助之旨，呼籲於社會，祈求於各界，於見聞之較切，益申訴之彌殷，重讀一月來助金記述，此中殆有千萬人之熱忱，二千餘學生之血淚，躍然紙上；回溯過去，膽念將來，待助學生勢將逐有增加，此則有望於輸款諸君之隨時繼續捐助，以本屆集款三十餘萬元，足見本報讀者之普遍，而對助學運動，已獲極深切之同情與一致之贊助；同人自當益加　勉，敬謹將事願以諸同學今後之成績及同人服務之心力，以報謝各界盛意於萬一；謹佈區區，幸諸同學勉之</p>

<p>二月十四日大陸新報載稱：大使館上海事務所田尻公使，於七日由滬出發，赴南京，廬州，蚌埠，安慶等內地視察，頃已公畢返滬，十三日在百老　大厦會見新聞記者，暢談內地經濟建設及　廢治外法權，交還租界等當前問題，其大意如次：</p>
<p>國府參戰，同時日本即行聲明交還租界，撤廢在華治外法權，移交新敵產，兼之國府方面努力加强各項實力，是以國府之政治力量，日見充沛，向抱觀望態度之上海租界內經濟界巨頭，亦先後轉變態度，協力支持國府，此項傾向，漸次深入民間後，更能促進國府政治力之强化，最近內地華人，在經濟上頗多建樹，此爲華人自動協助國府之明證，穩定僑券幣値，爲經濟建設之先次條件，關於　銀券與中儲券之關係，外界有種種謠傳，但決計盡力維持中儲券之價値，上次日方對國府交還新敵產一事，於加强經濟力頗多效用，至於今後如何處理新敵產一點，則以培養國府戰力爲要着，其處理辦法，不外乎此，交還租界，撤廢治外法權問題，當將日本專管租界先行交還，而後及於公公公共租界，法租界，是以必先使經濟復興，參戰後之內地經濟情形，大見好轉，淮河開放，得力尤大，尤以蚌埠之發展爲甚，該處華人對採辦農產物甚爲活躍，預料廬州，安慶等地，今後亦將漸次好轉。</p>

<h3 id="c51">經濟界的前提 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>通常的説，經濟界的前提，在於增進國家的幸福，扶助社會的繁榮。可是經濟界的思想與行動，必須以環境爲研究的范圍。在經濟界言經済，第一，須知所處的國家爲如何一個國家，第二，須知所處的時代爲如何一個時代，第三，須知所處的國家與時代，應有如何一個經済政策與經済設施。</p>
<p>在今日的環境下，我們必須認清今日的中國經済界是純粹屬於戰時經済的。因此，今日中國經濟界的前提，是在於採取如何一個經済政策與經済設施，以配合大東亞戰爭時代的環境與需要；而戰時經済的基本要求，尤在於政府與人民間的通力合作。</p>
<p>國家經濟界的一舉一動，必須顧到人民所度的生活；民間經濟界的一舉一重，必須顧到政府所處的地位。這幾句扼要的話，在原則上，可以說是今日中國經濟界的前提。</p>
<p>本報自今日始，謹以「經濟界」一欄與讀者公衆相見。本報「經濟界」的前提，是在於如何使得人人能有機會認識。並且討論今日中國經濟界的前提，換一句話說，就是以中國經濟界的前提爲前提。所以，本報「經濟界」，於經常性的報道經濟界消息與統計而外，一方面願依據當前環境情况，以作我們評判中國經濟的題材，一方面願依據戰時經濟原則，以作我們商榷中國經濟的資料。最後，却也是同樣重要的，就是本報「經濟界」希望能够盡量披露經濟界的言論與意見，以供大衆的商榷與參考。</p>
<h3 id="c52">復興中的國府經済　（上）　　中日經済密切合作底動向 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>一，國府經濟建設的意義</p>
<p>國府參戰底經濟意義，可以說是對日有莫大的貢獻。當然，目前拿華北底典常資源來看，對日的貢獻，的確偉大，例如山西山東等省底蘊藏無限的煤鑛，龍烟底鐵鑛，長蘆以及山東方面底食鹽棉花等。對於加强日本國防經濟方面重要的作用，是不待我們重新估計而自明的。但對於此類華北戰略資源的提供，日益增加，工不以參戰如何而有所增减，所以在此不　再加討論。由參戰關係，而發生變化的，倒莫如說是華中經濟。</p>
<p>華中底經濟與華北不同，現在不能直接希望對日有所提供。的確，在華中沿海一帶底都市，幾乎整個中國底工業生產力都薈萃於此。然而，這類工業，則以紡織和麵粉等輕工業爲大宗，談不到直接用作增强戰力方面；又加上鐵，煤炭等戰略資源，比起華北來，眞大有相形見絀之感。所謂華中最大的產業輕工業，也因事變而摧毀；尤其是上海的工業，由於大東亞戰爭爆發，隨而第三國貿易底斷絕，釀成原料來源封閉，內地物資移動困難，以致生產力竟陷於一蹶不振。即對農產物來說，我們暫且拋開軍隊當地籌餉關係不談外。對日供給，又是談何容易。因此，華中經濟的中心任務，一直到今天，與其說供給日本，母寗說恢復荒廢的生產力，藉此加强其自給力。</p>
<p>這種基本方針，參戰後仍未有所變化。然而復興華中經濟的方策，却以參戰爲機緣，而愈形突飛猛進。例如，積極擴充中日合辦事業，交還軍管理工塲，以及動員其他民族資本，重行調整國策公司與收買分配機構，平抑物價，鞏固儲蓄券等等，正在冉接再勵，努力進行。如這類實施方策收到效果，以及由復興華中經濟而實現民生安定時，則其力量之宏大，殊不亞於武力。</p>
<p>在戰爭狀態裏，任何國家都不會有絕對的生活快樂舒適，這是不言而喻的事。然而，在戰區民衆面前，如出現一種相對安定的和平區生活，廣汛地滲入戰區民衆底內心，便會使人發生一種厭戰的情緒。</p>
<p>在這種意義上，國府參戰所具有的經濟意義，不應當馬上求之於對日供給上，而應當看其將來的發展，以及對於戰區民衆所發生的影響。（瑢譯自一月二十七日東京經濟學者）</p>

<p>風起雲湧，盛極一時的保險公司，現在已經當局限制，在去年十二月十八日後，不予登記了。截至最近，連原有公司和尙未開幕的在內，共有九十六家。資本額最多的，爲五百萬，有兩家；二百五十萬的一家；二百萬的三家。少至數十萬以至十萬的，反爲多數。但資本旣如此鮮少，而承保額却容易時　超過他的資產，豈不十分危險？原來他們同業，都有互相分保的在來。例如某一保戶，　額達十萬的，便要找同業分保出去了。而分保額，却也有一定比例的。柱往也有　到一注鉅大　　後，同業中或因該項業務，危險性太重，而相率婉拒的。所以局外人有些不明　內幕的，　　保險業，專以招攬爲事：那裏知道有時也有爲難的地方呢？</p>

<h3 id="c67">從學習英語說起 <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— 羅董</p>
<p>近百年來，海洋交通，一方面爲了通商，一方面爲了吸收世界各國新知識，於是學習外國語成爲我國人一時的風氣。而外國語中最佔勢力的，是英語。</p>
<p>我國人學習英語，最鬧忙的塲所，是敎會和敎會學校。這些學習英語的人，遇見英美人士，當然盡量說英語；就是和中國同胞相見，也說英語，至少夾幾個英文在內。就學習心理來說，這種反覆練習，是有其功效的。不過就不少人學習英語的動機來說，其心便可誅了。一種是充時髦，自炫其能；一種是想藉英語，而在英美人下面吃飯，發洋財。</p>
<p>當然英美勢力在中國炙手可熱時，我們到處看見英文招牌，以至無數中英合璧的東西，到處可以聽見流暢無比的英語，以至不三不四的「洋涇浜」英語。在郵局，在海關，在火車站，在鹽務署，尤其是在洋行裏，我們可以遇到不少西裝革履的「高等華人」。如果有中裝同胞去問他們什麼公事，他們常以白眼相加，或「王顧左右而言他」。如果西裝同胞去問他們什麽事，還敷衍幾句。如果英美人來問他們什麼事，立刻「鞠躬如也」，「笑容可掬」，客氣到萬分。來到中國的英美人，大都沒有受過什麼良好敎育，到中國來的目的是發財；到中國後，對中國人　指氣使；而學了英語的同胞，對英美人只知一味阿諛，或竟失意承旨，結果益發不堪聞問了。</p>
<p>就溝通文化來說，學習外國語，不但不應阻抑，而且有鼓勵的必要；但是如果投機取巧，作爲發洋財」的捷徑，其流弊就無窮了。</p>
<p>我們希望一般家長和辦理敎育者，對於北齊顏之推在「顏氏家訓」裏說一段話，特別注意：</p>
<p>齊朝有一士大夫，嘗謂吾曰：我有一兒，年已十七，頗曉菁疏，敎其鮮卑語，及彈琵琶，稍欲通解，以此伏事公卿，無不寵愛，亦要事也』。我時俛　不答。異哉，此人之敎子也！若由此業自致卿相，亦不願汝曹爲之。」</p>
<p>假如顏氏這段話，能爲我國人所接受，作爲家訓，則中國的前途，當有一番新面目吧！</p>
<h3 id="c68">辣辛辛的感觸 <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— 余子英</p>
<p>因爲職務上關係，認識了幾位友邦朋友。昨天受另一位本國友人之托，替他代翻一件應用文，我本想自己動手，但　念那位友邦朋友即在我同一辦事處的三樓，近在咫尺，所以就把這麻煩差使拿上去叨他的光了。承他好意，擱起自己的公事，替我拔號先幹。他一邊聽我說，一邊振筆疾書，中問除語言界限方面，稍有疑問外（因爲我的日語並不十分流利）並無一點抓頭摸耳」之類的「揷　」。我的話說完，他的文也寫好，拿上手一看，很婉轉，很簡潔，正中我意。論這位朋友的學力和地位都不算高，而有這樣的文學修養，當然使人敬服，可是，他還給予我一腔辣辛辛的感觸。</p>
<p>我覺得目前我國國民的文化水準，實在銳退到無以立足　地位，而偏偏負着溝通文化的使命，這旣令人慚愧又令人惶恐。試把友邦的國民敎育和國民生活和我國作一　比，就够使有心人不寒而悚了。</p>
<p>日本的國民學校（上海南京各地都有）就其建筑宏偉，設備完善，學生服裝整潔，以及其舉動的嚴肅一望而知是一種上了軌道的敎育。內容十二分認眞；第一，敎師的選用。</p>
<h3 id="c69">一月份徵文錄取第一名　我的生活—醫院侍應生　（下） <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— 以靑</p>
<p>深秋的時候，我調到病房工作，我把個個呻吟的內科病人，呼號的外科病人，從診　室抬到病床上，一天天侍候他們，看他們漸漸痊愈，看他們步行着出院。尤其那些小兒科病人，進院的時候，那憔悴的小臉，着實叫人憐惜，可是過不了幾天，他在花園裏晒太陽了，再過不了幾天，他牽着他爸爸的手，或者伏在他媽媽的肩上，蘋果般的臉兒，浮着天眞的笑，活潑潑的出院了，那是最使人興奮的一回事，任何工作的勞苦，我都可以打一個對銷。</p>
<p>手衛室的工作，我很感興趣，做夢也沒想到，會有這樣的機會，我見到病人的肺和胃，我見到正在跳躍的心臟，見到醫師們把一根根肋骨截下，見到從腹膜炎病人的腹腔裏抽出的膿，見到小腸如何會漲大盲見到把整個腰子割去，割除，腸的手術，簡　司空見慣。雖然有時到深夜還不能結束我的工作，我還嫌三個月的時間，過得太快了。</p>
<p>化騐室的工作也相當有趣，我上班不到三天，已經在顯微鏡下分得出，那是白血球，那是赤血球，科學的昌明，使那醜惡的病菌，絲毫不能週形，這偉大的見識，使我對於工作，更加努力。意外的收穫，却博得那老年而仁慈的化騐師的垂靑。在考績單上註上九十五分，我額外領到五十元現金獎，至今我憧憬着解剖兎子來證實初期娠妊的化騐。不論那沉澱器，如何的重，搖得我手臂酸痛，不論那些大小便，痰和血，又臭又髒的東西，我狠自然的鎭日厮混着。總之，化騐室是値得留戀的。</p>
<p>我調到藥劑室上班的三個月裏，我讀熟了一千三百種藥各，多蒙三位藥劑生的熱忱，我抄錄了一百十種成藥的說明書。</p>
<p>元旦日的晚上，我檢討着過去的生活情形，我大膽的在日記簿上，記了這樣幾句話：</p>
<p>「誰說社會是冷酷的？如果社會果真冷酷，那我們應當是一個洪爐，把火熾熾的熱情，烘焙得社會溫暖過來。」</p>
<p>一十八個月悠悠的過去了，我覺得無上幸福，我希望跟着新年的來臨，得到更大的成就。我明白道是誰的賜與，我默默的禱吿，我感謝這隆厚的恩惠，我願把我的力量，供獻給大衆。我牢牢的記住，記住王校長的臨別贈言，「到處留心皆學問。」對其學歷，和能力都有完備而切實的審查，而且一旦身爲敎師者，也可受到國家，社會，人民各方面，精神和物質並重的保障，再加上他們本身愛國思想的激勵，在他們心目中只有「敎育神聖」四個字。第二，敎授功課也着重實際而絕少虛僞，特別看重科學。所以多人才而少似是而非或非驢非馬的廢才。返顧我國敎育，校舍，設備，制服固然談不到，而學生的品打禮貌在相形見絀之下也難堪入目了。前者是物質的，固然不能空口白話，可是後者是精神問題，敎育精神在那裏！說到內容主要的缺點，便是敎師的選用，審查馬虎，而國家社會，對他們愛莫能助，敎員本身忍受着意外的苦難。</p>
<p>我們知道日本的國民生活有幾個特點，第一，生活嚴肅。舉凡腐敗的勾當，如烟窰賭　他們是不許涉足的，並且據另一位日本靑年對我說，日本人在二十歲以內，按法律，不得吸食烟酒。至若生活的樸素，勤勉，節的等也都是盡人吿知的事實。第二，着重團體。他們稱本國人爲邦人。只要是邦人的公益事宜，不論是敎管、養、衛都以最大的犧性精神迎頭苦幹的。第三，富於研究心，這是最近的事，我親眼看一位日本業餘科學家，在一所亭子間，潛心研究。據說他足足費了三個整天，解析一條科學原理，最後終於在書本之外，別闢一條蹊徑。我不敢說，每個日人都有這樣濃烈的上進心，可是大體上說這確是他們的優點；我也不敢說，中國人中沒有這樣上進的人物，可是爲數極少，反過來看，我國國民生活也有幾個特點。第一消遣之風特盛於社會，逢人便問，作何消遣，開口電影，戲劇，閉口竹林雅經，而尤其觸目傷心的便是：榻横陳，呑雲吐霧；二，便是少團體觀念。只要從現實社會中看，熱心公益者有多少？隔岸觀火者有多少？假公益之美名，以充實其私人的腰包者又有多少？如果說沒有公德心是中國人的「致命傷」，那末，這「傷」現正還在「致」着「命」！第三，缺乏普通的上進心。我不能抹殺少數有志在黑暗中孤單摸索的好現象，可惜太少數了。論現實：他們是違反緊張的時代精神的叛徒，論將來，他們是斷送下一代中國的罪首，—我不忍這樣說，但又不得不說，因爲這是事實。</p>
<p>此外，不論從政治，實業以及社會科學等地方看，也都有同樣的感覺。這固有其複雜的背景，而一時不易爲力。可是爲國民者決不應該讓自己的意志陷於麻醉狀態的境地。</p>
<h3 id="c70">情感與理智 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— 小麟</p>
<p>讀了「我們需要熱情」之後，不禁使我聯想到情感與理智對於人生的關係。</p>
<p>人是一種組織複雜的動物，人的一生判斷事物，旣不可沒有理智，更不可缺少情感，太偏於理智便成冷酷，偏於府感便會哭美無當，失去「人」的尊嚴。</p>
<p>凡事只　理智。他一定是薄情的，他絕對不會受到家庭的溫暖，友情的可貴。人羣的樂趣，春天與冬天對於他是分別不出的，同他一同生活的人永遠像隔了一層冰墻，舉實例來說，前幾年轟動上海的弒父案的發生，還不是由於家庭間冷酷陰沉散無情感可言的結果？</p>
<p>凡事只憑情感，也是要不得的，情感只能保持相當的程度，決不能使它汛濫。喜怒無常，大哭大笑都不應該有，太富於情感的人，凡事都發生感觸，月亮啊！生離死別啊！鏡花水月啊！人生如夢啊！這些感觸往往會剝奪人生的進取心，憂憂鬱鬱而終其生。這是極對不行的！</p>
<p>所以我們固然需要熱情，但同樣也需要理智，二者相輔而行，缺一不可。</p>
<p>在事業上我們應憑着理智去解決問題，要抱着嚴肅的心去幹，純正的思想去克服阻難，決不可歪曲理智作非分之事，這樣別人自然會敬服你的果決的堅毅，抬高你的尊嚴。</p>
<p>在人情世故及家庭中，應該要情感一點，常保持家庭問的暖和，它可以靜養你一切的創傷。記得一句至理名言說；偉人是由和陸快樂的家庭創造出來的。」對於一起生活的人應抱溫暖的慰問與同情心，因爲你的快樂也在此時同時創造出來了。</p>
<p>所以情感與理智要有同樣的份量在我們的人生中，即要大聲疾呼「我們需要熱情」，同樣「我們需要理智」也是當然的事！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Hoping Our Allied Nation Japan Listens to the Voices of the Common People <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Since the Sino-Japanese Joint Agreement was announced, Japan's relinquishment of consular jurisdiction in China, the return of concessions, and enemy property transfers have entered the practical stage. This marks an epoch-making advancement in Sino-Japanese relations and a fundamental starting point for the permanent cooperation between the two great nations. It stands in stark contrast to the empty promises made by Britain and America to the Chongqing regime. We hope that the authorities of both countries will approach this matter with a solemn and careful attitude, demonstrating an uplifting spirit to all the nations of East Asia. However, we deeply feel that in this practical process, the Japanese authorities must also pay attention to several matters, especially those most closely related to the Chinese common people.</p>
<p>Relinquishing consular jurisdiction, returning concessions, and transferring enemy property are the most glorious pages in the future history of Sino-Japanese relations, and the most powerful indication of Japan's support for China's development towards independence and self-strengthening. However, generally speaking, at present, those who directly feel the benefits of this East Asian moral spirit are still only the Chinese authorities and a segment of the upper class. As for the Chinese common people—the majority of the middle and lower classes—their understanding and personal experience of this powerful gesture from the allied nation is currently, to say the least, very vague and not of the utmost importance. Their understanding and experience of the actual benefits will be in the more distant future, not the present. Yet the Chinese common people are currently the most powerful supporters of cooperation with Japan and the defense of the Greater East Asia War. Only with their spontaneous and automatic support can all policies for the close cooperation between China and Japan and for striving for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War be smoothly and thoroughly completed. Therefore, in addition to expressing our sincere gratitude and respect for Japan's relinquishment of extraterritorial rights in China, return of concessions, and transfer of enemy property, we in the press cannot but hope with the same enthusiasm that the Japanese authorities will go even further, keenly perceive the urgent needs of the Chinese common people, and show the same goodwill as the relinquishment of extraterritorial rights, return of concessions, and transfer of enemy property.</p>
<p>Currently, the urgent needs of the Chinese common people that they require Japan to assist in resolving are certainly not just one or two things, but the most important is the stability of daily life. The most urgent is the food problem. China is an agricultural country and was originally self-sufficient in food. However, due to the special circumstances of wartime and the imperfect supply and adjustment, it has become the most threatening problem in people's lives, universally affecting the national psyche and becoming a major factor of social unrest. Secondly, there is the problem of prices. Originally, in wartime, price fluctuations and increases are unavoidable phenomena in all countries. As long as the social organization is tight, the national policies are thoroughly implemented, and the people's minds are stable, serious consequences will not occur. Japan has not experienced serious price problems in the six years of the war, even in the more than a year of fighting the world's most powerful Britain and America, and this is the reason. However, in our China, the price problem has created a few extremely wealthy people and has further created a great threat to the daily lives of the majority of people. In the past, the Chinese and Japanese authorities have not spared any effort to find solutions, but comprehensive price controls and reasonable regulation to achieve the most ideal and satisfactory results still await the future. Thirdly, there is the problem of transportation. The unnecessary obstacles and pain that travelers experience every day are undeniable, with only differences in degree due to location and time. As for materials, such as the mining, sale, and transportation of raw materials and the distribution of finished products, they are inevitably inconvenienced by transportation, causing the majority of Chinese farmers, industrialists, and merchants to feel depressed. As a result, the increase in wartime production and the rational exchange and allocation of materials are inevitably adversely affected, and may even directly or indirectly affect prices and national life.</p>
<p>Problems of this kind sometimes seem to be superficial, trivial, but in reality, they are very closely related to the daily lives of the majority of people. Therefore, if the Japanese authorities can pay special attention to them and seek quick and reasonable solutions, we firmly believe that if our allied nation makes one more effort in this area today, the effect may not necessarily be as great as the relinquishment of extraterritorial rights, the return of concessions, and the transfer of enemy property, but it will certainly be easier for the majority of Chinese people to understand and support, and the effect will be practical and rapid. At the same time, it will also be sufficient to assist the governments of both countries in implementing wartime policies more smoothly.</p>

<p>Full Text of Chairman Wang's Address</p>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch): On January 9th, the National Government announced its participation in the Greater East Asia War, cooperating with our allied nation Japan to defeat the common enemy of British and American aggression. Therefore, the convocation of this National Military Conference is of great significance.</p>
<p>Since our allied nation Japan launched the Greater East Asia War on December 8th of the year before last, the National Government immediately declared its determination to share weal and woe with our allied nation Japan. At that time, many comrades, especially armed comrades, advocated that we should further implement participation in the war. Their advocacy was upright and just. This war is an East Asian war. China is a part of East Asia, so China's participation in the war is natural. Compared to Chongqing's side, acting as running dogs for Britain and America, dispatching troops to Burma and India, and turning against East Asian compatriots, the distinction between obedience and defiance is truly as vast as the distance between heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Some people think that China's national strength and people's strength are not enough to participate in the war, so why have the name of participation without the reality? This is incorrect. What China should have is determination, and what should be expressed is its position. China is a part of East Asia, and China should stand on the side of defending East Asia, opposing the aggressors of East Asia and those who willingly betray East Asia. Moreover, once the determination is made and the position is established, the national strength and people's strength will naturally continue to grow and be used for the defense of East Asia. It is definitely not just having the name of participation without the reality. Some people also think that in recent years, the peace movement has been advocating peace, so isn't it contradictory to participate in the war now? This is even more incorrect. The peace movement began based on the National Father's Pan-Asianism, responding to our allied nation Japan's proposal to build a new order in East Asia. The so-called peace refers to the fundamental elimination of past disputes between China and Japan, the re-establishment of friendly neighborly relations, each loving their own country, loving their neighbors, and loving East Asia together, to achieve co-existence and co-prosperity with one heart and one mind. It is definitely not some kind of following old ways, seeking temporary ease and living in a cowardly manner that can be confused with the two words of peace. Therefore, when the Greater East Asia War came, China, from sharing weal and woe with our allied nation Japan, further participated in the war with the determination to live and die together. This is a consistent proposition from beginning to end. Then why didn't our allied nation Japan express support for China's participation in the war in the past? This is very easy to understand. Since the Greater East Asia War began on December 8th of the year before last, our allied nation Japan has been breaking the power of Britain and America independently. As a result of the sweeping operations of the army and navy, the British and American forces in the East Pacific and Southeast Asia have been destroyed, and their bases for invading East Asia have also been destroyed. Within a few months, the American-owned Philippine Islands, the British-owned Malay Archipelago and Burma, and the Dutch-owned East Indies were all successively occupied by our allied nation Japan. Since our allied nation Japan launched the war independently and supported the war, what it hoped from China was to assist in everything with the spirit of sharing weal and woe, based on the meaning of defending East Asia, and did not hope that China, after years of decline, would raise the issue of participating in the war, so as to arouse suspicion among some people, or even be used as an excuse by Chongqing.</p>
<p>Then why does our allied nation Japan now support China's participation in the war? Because since the Greater East Asia War began on December 8th of the year before last, China's statement of sharing weal and woe, the efforts to practice the New Citizen Movement, the training of young people in schools, and the training of general working youth, especially the various training programs of the Central Army Officer Training Corps and the Naval Advanced Training Class, the people and army under the rule of the National Government have had a full understanding of the meaning of the Greater East Asia War and China's own responsibilities, and have had a full determination and awareness. The means of Chongqing's side, acting as running dogs for Britain and America and betraying East Asia, have long been abandoned by everyone. China, from a statement of sharing weal and woe, has further implemented participation in the war, reaching a point where conditions are ripe. On December 22nd of last year, I met Prime Minister Tojo in Tokyo.</p>
<p>There are a few most important words: "East Asia has one billion people. This quantity is not available to any group of countries in the world. With this quantity, plus unity, there is absolute certainty in obtaining the final victory of the Greater East Asia War and establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." These most important words explain everything. The so-called unity is to treat East Asian compatriots as East Asian comrades, each loving their own country, loving their neighbors, and loving East Asia together. There is nothing that cannot be done with the power of this kind of unity.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, armed comrades, after hearing the above words, you must have the following two feelings: First, our current national strength and people's strength are still very weak. Second, our unity is very important. Unity is strength. With these two feelings, we can review the efforts we should make during the period of participating in the war.</p>
<p>First, some armed comrades advocate selecting troops and transporting them to the front lines to share the hardships of our allied soldiers and at the same time do their best. This kind of advocacy is very commendable. But I want to say a word of caution: the responsibility on the front line is certainly great, but the responsibility in the rear is equally great. China is in the rear of the Greater East Asia War, and in this rear, there are unscrupulous elements in Chongqing who willingly act as running dogs for Britain and America and betray East Asia, and there are disturbances from the Communists, and our military strength is not yet sound, with shortcomings being discovered at any time and anywhere. This is not only what the National Government is deeply saddened by, but also what our allied nation is anxiously concerned about. Our ability to guarantee the security of the rear is the ability to share the hardships of our allied soldiers on the front lines and relieve them of their worries. This is not different from sharing the hardships on the front lines. Therefore, what we must strive for most during the period of participating in the war is to guarantee local security. The so-called locality is the root of China's life, like a tree with roots and water with a source. China is based on agriculture and has not yet developed to the extent of a modern industrial society, so its life is not concentrated in cities like modern industrial societies, but is scattered in rural areas. What we want to fight for is not just "points" and "lines," but especially "areas." How can we protect the areas we have already obtained? How can we expand the areas we have not yet obtained? How can we increase our national strength and people's strength? We must enable everyone to engage in increasing production. How can production be increased? We must enable the people to live and work in peace. How can we enable the people to live and work in peace? We must be able to guarantee local security. If we know that our current national strength and people's strength are still very weak, then we should know even more where our efforts lie.</p>
<p>Second, I often tell armed comrades that we must share weal and woe with our allied nation, we must first be able to share weal and woe ourselves. If we want to live and die together with our allied nation, we must first be able to live and die together ourselves. One is how we treat the people. We must know that we treat the people as if they were our own hearts and minds, and the people will regard us as their own limbs. We must truly achieve the two sentences taught by the National Father: first, armed forces combine with the people; second, armed forces are the armed forces of the people. One is how we treat our own comrades-in-arms. All our troops now are assembled from several years ago, each with its own history and each with its own environment. I deeply understand this. But if we want to become the armed forces of the people and the army of the country, we must break down the concept of regionalism. The other day, the National Economic Commission held a plenary meeting, and there was a very important resolution, which was to break down the concept of regionalism and form economic unity. This is the first key to economic recovery. As it is in the economy, so it is especially necessary in the military. We armed comrades must never only care about the place where we are stationed and our own troop system. We must know that no matter which piece of land it is, it is the land of the Republic of China. For example, within the whole body, if one place hurts, the whole body hurts. If one place gets sick, the whole body gets sick. There must be no estrangement. As for the troops, if they are considered to be the people's and the country's, then there is only one system, and there are no scattered systems. This is not only the correct principle of the national army, but also the essence of elite troops. There are no troops with scattered systems that can exist for a long time. Even if they occasionally succeed for a while, they will eventually perish. We must strive to make our blood and all our enthusiasm penetrate into the people and the country, becoming a powerful cell. We must never let it exist apart from the people and the country. The above two things must be done. One is to share weal and woe and live and die together with the people. The other is that our comrades-in-arms should share weal and woe and live and die together. Only in this way can we share weal and woe and live and die together with our allied nation to win the victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Third, our slogan is to revive China and defend East Asia. These two things are one thing. If we cannot revive China, we will definitely not have the ability to share the responsibility of defending East Asia. Only when East Asia is defended will the revival of China be guaranteed. This is a very obvious principle. On January 9th, we announced that we would participate in the Greater East Asia War. On the same day, our allied nation Japan concluded an agreement with us to return the concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights. This proves that we are willing to share the responsibility of defending East Asia, and our allied nation Japan is also willing to assist us in completing the mission of reviving China. This is not an exchange condition, but a psychological exchange and a common goal. We armed comrades must see this and must further strengthen our determination, muster our courage, and move forward until we reach our goal. But we must pay attention to our allied nation's respect for our country's sovereignty and its assistance in completing our country's independence. We can believe that the beliefs we have held on weekdays have evidence of being realized, and we are more gratified and more motivated. However, we must not develop a kind of vanity. We have nothing to be proud of now. Not only do we have to consider how to rejuvenate the national strength, which is so weak in the Greater East Asia War, so that we can share some of the responsibility, but we are also still struggling in the midst of confusion about the country's revival. If we do not have a humble and sincere attitude, enthusiasm, and sincerity towards our allied soldiers and other people, then we will destroy the roots and shoots that we have cultivated with great difficulty since the peace movement, like a storm. I often encourage myself and all armed comrades with the four words "humility and self-respect." Humility is the attitude that should be had towards advanced countries, and self-respect is the effort that one should make for oneself. If there is only humility without effort, it is useless. The more effort one makes, the more one knows one's own shortcomings, and that kind of humility is sincere humility.</p>
<p>The above three points are what I encourage myself and each other with during the period of participation in the war. It is rare for armed comrades to gather together, and I wish all armed comrades good health and hope that you will fully exert the effectiveness of collective wisdom in the meeting and make greater contributions to the revival of China and the defense of East Asia.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Minister of Commerce Explains Policy on Purchasing Materials from China in the House of Representatives <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch): Minister of Commerce Kishi, in response to questions from Representative Nakajima on the Petroleum Monopoly Law Committee of the House of Representatives today, explained the policy of the Trading Corporation on purchasing materials from China, stating in essence: The problem of commodity prices in China is extremely complicated because local prices are constantly rising. Regarding materials imported from China to Japan, such as iron ore, ore sand, coal, etc., it is relatively less problematic if they are produced by Japanese companies or operated with Japanese investment. However, the production relationships regarding cotton and agricultural products are extremely complicated. The most difficult thing is collection. As the Minister of Greater East Asia said, there are currently two views on the so-called "purchase at appropriate prices." One is to focus on Japanese prices, and the other is to focus on local living conditions or currency and materials. It is difficult to reconcile the two. Therefore, when the Trading Corporation makes purchases, it is not appropriate for the price to be determined according to instructions from the Japanese side. It should be purchased at appropriate prices that adapt to the current situation. This is extremely important from the perspective of stabilizing people's livelihoods and promoting smooth material exchange. The losses incurred by the Trading Corporation when selling materials purchased at these appropriate prices in Japan at fixed prices will be covered by appropriations from the special account for exchange transaction adjustments. Currently, trade between our country and China is very important in our country's trade policy. Therefore, in order to enhance our war effort, we must adopt cautious countermeasures for developing resources in China and purchasing materials. These measures will be studied after the implementation of the new policy towards China. When these measures are formulated and implemented, sufficient consideration should also be given to the actual conditions in Japan and China. Regarding this point, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry has established close liaison with the Ministry of Greater East Asia.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Ishiwatari Returns to Japan Via Shanghai: Delivers Important Remarks Elucidating the National Government's Finances, Monetary Circulation, and Other Issues <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Dispatch from the Central News Agency: Mr. Shotaro Ishiwatari, the highest economic advisor of the National Government, met with a group of reporters at the Cathay Hotel here on the 15th on his way back to Japan. He made remarks on the National Government's current financial, monetary, and currency issues, as well as the handling of the transfer of enemy property. The following two or three points are particularly noteworthy:</p>
<p>(1) The National Government's budget for the first half of the year can be fully balanced without issuing public bonds or raising tax rates.</p>
<p>(2) After the military notes are withdrawn, the ratio of Central Reserve Bank notes to Japanese yen will be determined at 18 yen to 100 Central Reserve Bank notes.</p>
<p>(3) The ratio of Central Reserve Bank notes to Federal Reserve Bank notes will be determined at an appropriate point based on the substantive value and basis of the two currencies.</p>
<p>The main points of Advisor Ishiwatari's remarks are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>National Government Financial Issues</p>
<p>Regarding the National Government's finances, the situation for the first half of the year (January to June) is generally clear. The budget for the first half of the year is 90 million yuan per month, a considerable increase compared to last year. Tax revenue is also continuing to increase smoothly. Therefore, it is expected that tax revenue alone will be sufficient to cover expenditures. As a result, there are no plans to issue public bonds in the first half of the year. The surplus carried over from last year is also a considerable amount, and it has also been decided not to transfer it to this period's budget. On the expenditure side, expenditures required to strengthen combat capabilities and expand productivity are expected to increase. However, unless there are major unforeseen temporary expenditures, taxes will not be increased. Therefore, at present, increasing existing tax rates or levying new taxes is not being considered.</p>
<p>Monetary Circulation and Price Issues</p>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank notes are currently linked to military notes at a ratio of 18 yuan. Minister of the Greater East Asia Affairs Aoki has previously stated that this ratio of 18 yuan will absolutely not be changed. In the future, after the military notes are withdrawn, the ratio between the Japanese yen, which has an equivalent value to the military notes, and the Central Reserve Bank notes is also considered to be determined at 18 yuan. This is most beneficial for both China and Japan. Judging from the price levels in Japan and China, the ratio of 18 yuan is somewhat strained. However, in this important period of the Greater East Asia War, it should not be changed. The operation of the special yen system used for trade settlement is being studied in relation to the trade organization to be established soon in Japan. The ratio of the special yen has no relation to the above ratio of 18 yuan. The relationship between Central Reserve Bank notes and Federal Reserve Bank notes is different from the situation of Central Reserve Bank notes to Japanese yen, and should be determined separately. That is, if the current ratio of 30 yuan for Central Reserve Bank notes to Federal Reserve Bank notes (Shanghai exchange rate) is not appropriate, then a new ratio that is compatible should be re-determined based on the real value of the two currencies. This should be considered separately from the 18-yuan ratio of Central Reserve Bank notes to Japanese yen. Therefore, there may be a difference between the ratio of Central Reserve Bank notes to Japanese yen and the ratio of Central Reserve Bank notes to Federal Reserve Bank notes. This is actually contradictory to the principle of Federal Reserve Bank notes being equivalent to Japanese yen. However, this kind of contradiction in the financial aspect under wartime is unavoidable.</p>
<p>After the issuance of Central Reserve Bank notes increases, establishing a policy for their withdrawal is most important in monetary policy. The National Government has already begun research and decided to implement it soon. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Issuing food storage bonds. This project is ready, so it can be issued immediately. After selling the food storage bonds to the general public, a considerable amount of Central Reserve Bank notes can be recovered.</p>
<p>2. Implementing a prize-linked savings system. This is a system that has been implemented in China for a long time, that is, savings with attached bonuses. This prize-linked savings will be implemented under the guidance of the Central Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>3. Issuing lotteries. This is also a method that has been implemented in China for a long time. Currently, it is quite prevalent in Manchuria and North China. This method of issuing lotteries is also effective for absorbing funds, so the National Government is also studying it.</p>
<p>The above policy for recovering funds also has the effect of maintaining the value of Central Reserve Bank notes. The most important thing for maintaining the value of Central Reserve Bank notes is to stabilize prices. There are various difficulties in implementing price countermeasures in China. The current policy is to have the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and other commercial sectors have full consultations with both Chinese and Japanese authorities to ensure that private organizations thoroughly cooperate in price countermeasures. Increasing production and promoting the exchange of materials are the fundamental principles for suppressing prices, which goes without saying. In today's wartime, increasing production has many difficulties. However, the National Government has adopted a policy of striving to increase production to the best of its ability. It is currently conducting research and plans to use materials produced in the interior as raw materials to revive the closed factories in Shanghai to promote the exchange of materials between Shanghai and the interior. At the same time, it will also promote the exchange of materials between Central China and North China in order to increase the import of coal and raw materials from North China.</p>
<p>Handling and Utilization of Transferred Enemy Property</p>
<p>Regarding the handling of transferred enemy property, the National Government has previously established an Enemy Property Management Committee. In the future, it will be handled individually based on the order of receipt from the Japanese side. As for the specific handling agency, it has been decided to establish an office of the Enemy Property Management Committee in Shanghai. Some people have advocated that a portion of the transferred enemy property should be handed over to the Central Reserve Bank. This is also quite insightful because it can indeed strengthen the foundation of the Central Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>Operational Guidelines of the National Economic Commission</p>
<p>After the National Government's participation in the war, the National Economic Commission added powerful figures from the economic circles of Central and North China, and its structure was strengthened. The first plenary session was held on the 12th and 13th. The fact that Chinese economic giants and National Government officials, such as Chairman Wang, gathered together already has a great effect. In the future, it will be held once every two months to promote the relationship between the National Government and the Shanghai financial community. The National Government has also decided that in the future, it will first solicit the opinions of the National Economic Commission before formally deciding on important policies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Advisor Ishiwatari will return to Japan soon. According to reports, the purpose of this return to Japan is to attend the parliament.</p>

<p>Berlin, 15th, Huitong News Agency: Berlin sources announced last night that the German army has completed the planned withdrawal from Rostov and Voroshilovgrad.</p>
<p>Moscow, 15th, Allied News Agency: The Soviet Information Bureau issued a special war bulletin last night stating that the Soviet army has occupied the city of Rostov (located on the Don River) and the city of Voroshilovgrad (located in the Donets River basin).</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th, Huitong News Agency: Berlin sources claim that before withdrawing from Rostov and Voroshilovgrad, the German army destroyed all important military equipment, and war materials and wounded soldiers were also moved elsewhere. Although the enemy's offensive was fierce at times, the withdrawal was not affected by it.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th, Allied News Agency: Kharkov was still in bloody battles last Saturday. The German tank force repelled the Soviet army's offensive. A German unit destroyed nine Soviet tanks, thirty-two flat-trajectory guns, and captured two thousand people. On the entire Eastern Front, the Soviet army lost a total of one hundred and thirty-four tanks last Saturday. Several key points southeast of Kharkov have been recaptured by the German army. The Soviet army repeatedly attacked the east of the city, but the German army held its ground and destroyed twelve of its tanks. Another four tanks were destroyed northeast of the city. Fierce fighting is still underway.</p>
<p>Headquarters of the German Leader, 15th, Huitong News Agency: This afternoon's German war bulletin stated that the German army fighting on the Eastern European front is strong and skilled, repelling the attacking Soviet army, causing heavy losses, and retreating without success. Yesterday, the Soviet army attacked Novorossiysk and several bridgeheads in the Kuban, suffering losses and retreating. The winter battles in the Don River estuary and the Kursk area are becoming increasingly fierce. A unit of enemy cavalry that attacked the German defense line from the rear has been annihilated. Our army withdrew from Rostov and Voroshilovgrad according to plan, without being hindered by the enemy. Between Voroshilov and Lake Ladoga, and in Leningrad, the Soviet army launched another large-scale offensive yesterday, but was crushed by our army's fierce artillery fire.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th, Huitong News Agency: The Soviet army in the southern route of Eastern Europe is pressing the German army and is still fighting fiercely. The German army is strong and determined, and is fighting hard. Although the enemy continues to deploy fresh troops, they have not been able to succeed. The situation is fierce northwest of Voroshilovgrad and southeast of Kharkov. South of Kharkov, a Soviet cavalry unit was crushed by German tanks and mechanized units. The fighting east of Kharkov is still intense. The German army has taken countermeasures against the enemy troops assaulting the front lines. The fighting north of Kursk is becoming increasingly fierce. Berlin believes that the army's withdrawal from Rostov and Voroshilovgrad is a strategy of avoiding strength and attacking weakness, enticing the enemy to advance. The fighting in the Leningrad area is relatively calm. The climate on the entire Eastern European front is changing from severe cold to mild warmth, now around the freezing point.</p>
<p>Soviet Army Pays a Heavy Price, Rostov Reduced to Ruins</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th, Allied News Agency: According to Eastern Front sources, intense offensive and defensive battles have recently unfolded in the Voroshilovgrad area. On the 13th, the Soviets finally broke into the northern part of the main base. The German army resisted desperately and launched a counterattack against the absolutely superior Soviet army to stop its offensive. The Soviet army continued to attack fiercely from the north and south under the cover of tanks, gradually entering the stage of street fighting. The German authorities announced on the 14th that the German army had withdrawn from the city. As a result of several days of fierce fighting, the Soviet army in that area suffered heavy losses. The infantry units in the northern area were completely annihilated. In addition, the units that attempted to secure the important roads passing through the city were also defeated by the German tank force's counterattack.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 15th, Allied News Agency: The German army defending Rostov withdrew on the 14th according to plan, in excellent order. Since February 6th, when the Soviet army advanced to the opposite bank of Rostov, Badaisk and the Sea of Azov, Rostov had been under pressure from the Soviet army. The two armies had been engaged in offensive and defensive battles across the Don River. After the Soviet army's unsuccessful crossing of the Don River, the attack shifted to the north. For several days, the Soviet army had been fiercely attacking the German army's positions with an overwhelming superior force. On the 12th, Novocherkassk, a key point 25 kilometers northeast of Rostov, fell into the hands of the Soviet army. At the same time, the Soviet army in the middle reaches of the Donets River also moved south from the Kramatorskaya and Voroshilovgrad areas, advancing to Mariupol, west of Rostov, cutting off the German army's retreat route, intending to encircle the German garrison in Rostov. After several days of unprecedented fierce fighting, the Rostov German defense force under the command of Marshal Mannstein finally withdrew from the city on the 14th, retreating to its predetermined position. It has now prepared to intercept the Soviet army. According to Soviet sources, after the German army's withdrawal, Rostov was surrounded by fierce fire, and the entire city has been reduced to ruins.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 15th, Allied News Agency: According to Axis and Allied sources last night, there was only fierce artillery fire and reconnaissance battles in the Tunisian area last Saturday. German aircraft fiercely bombed military facilities at the port of Benghazi. Other than that, there were no major battles. According to a Reuters correspondent with the British First Army in Tunisia, it is clear that the Axis army intends to hold on as much as possible in Tunisia and delay the situation. Judging from the continuous supply of troops and military supplies from Italy, it can be seen that General Rommel is determined to fight a decisive battle on the Mareth Line. According to the Axis side, the infantry reinforcement from Italy is being transported by Italian destroyers, while military supplies and gasoline are being transported by air.</p>
<p>Vichy, 14th, Havas News Agency: Yesterday, the air forces of both the Axis and Allied forces were very active over Europe, taking advantage of the clear weather. British and American aircraft groups again attacked southern Italy and Sicily, targeting trains for bombing. As a result, there were many casualties among passengers.</p>
<p>Rome, 15th, Huitong News Agency: The Italian military headquarters announced that enemy aircraft attacked Milan in several batches last night, dropping many explosive and incendiary bombs, destroying most of the residences, killing sixteen people and injuring two hundred and twenty-four. Anti-aircraft guns shot down two four-engine bombers. One enemy pilot jumped down by parachute and has been captured. Spezia was attacked by air, killing one person and injuring twenty-two.</p>

<h3 id="e19">The National Government Establishes a Wartime Political System: The Establishment of the National Defense Council and Reform of Administrative Organs <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Strengthening Political Power</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government has shared weal and woe with Japan, dedicating all its material resources and spirit to assist in completing the war mission; thoroughly implementing various measures to solidify Japan's major logistical bases. To adapt to the great achievements of the Empire's war over the past year, it demonstrated its determination to go further, declaring that it would live and die with the Empire; to fully leverage cooperation in completing the war, it launched a comprehensive self-strengthening policy, gradually forming a combat system. At the same time, the National Government expressed its final determination to declare war on Britain and the United States; as China stood tall in the face of the new situation, Sino-Japanese relations also entered a new stage. Simultaneously with the National Government's declaration of war, the Japanese government issued a joint pledge with the National Government to mutually assist in completing the war; China and Japan announced a comprehensive cooperative commitment in all aspects of the joint war effort, including military, political, and economic affairs. Simultaneously, Japan, based on the fundamental principles of China's autonomy, independence, and the exertion of the National Government's own political power, concluded the Sino-Japanese Agreement to swiftly build a new China, abandoning all exclusive concessions in China and abolishing extraterritorial rights. As a member of the common front, China's foreign relations have been clarified, and it is actively carrying out war tasks and cooperating in the construction of Greater East Asia; Japan, in response, decided to re-establish Sino-Japanese relations to adapt to the new situation, fully intending to support the construction of the new China.</p>
<p>In this regard, China's autonomy and independence have substantially entered the practical stage: the National Government's own political power has also been strengthened epochally. The foundation of the National Government, which had not been strong, has been transformed into a powerful and solid one, fully displaying the outline and energy of an independent government. Only by thoroughly understanding this autonomy and political power can various wartime policies against Britain and the United States be effectively implemented. Therefore, the National Government can concentrate the people's strength under a clear banner, mobilize all material resources and spirit to carry out war tasks, thoroughly fulfill the mission of defending Greater East Asia, and effectively carry out the work of clearing the countryside in terms of material resources and the New National Movement in terms of spirit. In this way, by exerting the political power of the National Government, the total mobilization of China's material resources and spirit can constitute the foundation of a solid combat power, which is what Japan is most concerned about. The relationship between China and Japan, sharing weal and woe and living and dying together, will henceforth be thoroughly expanded, which goes without saying.</p>
<p>After China declared war, the National Government first sought to establish a wartime system and strive to exert effective political power. The establishment of the Supreme National Defense Council and the reform of the National Government's administrative organs are for this purpose. The Supreme National Defense Council constitutes the core of the National Government's wartime system; to adapt to wartime needs, all military, political, economic, and other policies are decided by the council headed by Chairman Wang; and the trend of re-establishing the domestic system of the wartime National Government in the future is also noteworthy. In addition, the reform of the National Government's administrative organs is, of course, to strengthen the National Government's wartime system, concentrate all power in the Executive Yuan, so as to exert high efficiency, and strive for simplicity of affairs in order to clarify the allocation of responsibilities. In this way, both military and political aspects during wartime can quickly and appropriately respond to the ever-changing war situation, which achieves the widespread and in-depth exertion of the National Government's political power.</p>
<p>Establishment of the Supreme National Defense Council</p>
<p>The Supreme National Defense Council is directly under the Central Political Committee (Chairman is Wang Jingwei), the highest decision-making body for national policy, and is the highest body for deciding important wartime national policy matters. The Supreme National Defense Council meets once a week (temporary meetings are held when necessary). During the recess of the Central Committee, which is held once a month, it performs its duties on its behalf, and the decisions are reported to the Central Political Committee as appropriate. In essence, the Supreme National Defense Council is the body that performs the duties of the Central Political Committee, and the Central Political Committee is the reporting and management body after the Supreme National Defense Council's decisions. Its members are selected from the central talents in the military and political fields to tighten and organicize the connection between the military and political fields. At the same time, it is decided that the Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission will also participate, and local military and political leaders may also participate when necessary, so as to achieve the organic connection between the central and local authorities. At the same time, in addition to the establishment of the Supreme National Defense Council mentioned above, the Central Political Committee retains the power to suspend the effectiveness of existing laws and regulations in order to adapt to wartime emergencies. In addition, emergency decrees are directly submitted to the government for implementation without going through the Legislative Yuan, thereby expanding the powers of the Central Political Committee and seeking to simplify political affairs. The Chairman of the Central Political Committee also serves as the Chairman of the Supreme National Defense Council.</p>
<p>Major Reform of Administrative Organs</p>
<p>The reform of the administrative organs of the National Government was decided and announced at the first Supreme National Defense Council meeting. Its purpose is to reorganize the Executive Yuan in order to clarify responsibilities; more emphasis is placed on simplifying affairs in order to achieve a high degree of efficiency in political affairs; and various committees within the Executive Yuan are abolished in order to eliminate surplus personnel in various departments. At the same time, although the number of staff in each department does not have to be the same, since the committee is subordinate to the department, it is stipulated that the number of people should not exceed the number of people in the previous committee era. Namely,</p>
<p>(1) The National Economic Commission under the Executive Yuan is changed to be directly under the National Government.</p>
<p>(2) The New National Movement Promotion Committee is changed from being under the Executive Yuan to being directly under the National Government.</p>
<p>(3) The Ministry of Personnel of the Examination Yuan is transferred to the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>(4) The Social Movement Guidance Committee and the Relief Committee are merged and renamed the Ministry of Social Welfare.</p>
<p>(5) The Food Administration Committee is renamed the Ministry of Food, which is responsible for the distribution of food throughout the country and matters related to increasing production.</p>
<p>(6) The Frontier Affairs Committee is renamed the Frontier Affairs Bureau and is subordinate to the Ministry of Interior.</p>
<p>(7) The Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee is renamed the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau and is subordinate to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>(8) The Water Conservancy Committee and the Ministry of Transportation are merged to establish the Ministry of Construction, which manages national water conservancy, transportation, and urban construction.</p>
<p>Thus, the original five yuan and ten ministries became five yuan and thirteen ministries. The various ministries under the Executive Yuan are the eleven ministries of Foreign Affairs, Interior, Propaganda, Education, Finance, Industry, Social Welfare, Construction, Food, Judicial Administration, and Personnel, in addition to the two ministries of the Army and Navy directly under the Military Affairs Commission. In addition, the positions of Chief of the Counselor's Office and Director of the Legislative Bureau of the Executive Yuan were abolished, and replaced by one Secretary-General and two Deputy Secretaries-General; the previous system of Political Vice Ministers and Permanent Vice Ministers under each minister was changed to one Vice Minister; for the purpose of recruiting talents, a committee of three or five people was established in each ministry to provide advice and suggestions to the minister.</p>
<p>The transfer of the Ministry of Personnel, formerly under the Examination Yuan, to the Executive Yuan is, of course, due to the deep understanding of the importance of official selection during wartime; the newly established three ministries of Construction, Food, and Social Welfare are indispensable for stabilizing people's livelihoods, increasing welfare, strengthening the National Government, and cultivating combat power. The National Economic Commission must manage important issues such as expanding productivity, economic development, material collection and distribution, price countermeasures, and Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in the future, so it is transferred from the Executive Yuan and made directly under the government, which recognizes the absolute importance of economic countermeasures in preparation for flexible use in the future. The New National Movement Promotion Committee is now directly under the government because the New National Movement must be consistent with its name, and be rapidly materialized and concretized, so that the people's lives can thoroughly adapt to wartime requirements, emphasizing its importance. Therefore, among the five yuan, the powers of the Legislative, Judicial, Examination, and Control Yuans are gradually reduced except for the Executive Yuan; the center of gravity of political promotion during wartime is concentrated in the Central Political Committee, the Supreme National Defense Council, and the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>Changes in the Political System</p>
<p>Once again, let us review the history of the reorganization of the political organs since the National Government returned to Nanjing. When the National Government returned to Nanjing in March of the 29th year of the Republic of China, it had a huge administrative organization with five yuan, fourteen ministries, and various committees.</p>
<p>However, after this administrative organization was implemented for a year, it was reorganized for the first time in July of the previous year, becoming a system of five yuan and ten ministries. At that time, personnel changes with Kuomintang members as the core were realized. However, it was still far from the standard of a wartime administrative organization. In December of the same year, the Greater East Asia War broke out. The National Government declared that it would share weal and woe and defend the rear, immediately taking on the important task of serving the rear of the Greater East Asia War and maintaining local security. In this regard, the military organs were thoroughly reformed in August of last year, finally realizing the system from peacetime posture to wartime posture. The two ministries of the Army and Navy were placed directly under the Military Affairs Commission. Under the absolute authority of Chairman Wang, a Chief of General Staff was established. On the one hand, the unification of military orders and military administration was strengthened, and on the other hand, the number of personnel in the public affairs organs was thoroughly reduced, implementing the principles of "rather be short than excessive" and "using talents according to their aptitude" in terms of personnel. In this way, the wartime posture in all aspects was fully demonstrated. Following the above-mentioned reform of the military organs, the wartime reorganization of the administrative organs was, of course, inevitable. Since the autumn of last year, various reform proposals have been put forward by both China and Japan on the issue of the wartime posture of the administrative organs. Therefore, administrative reform has become an inevitable issue sooner or later. In addition, since the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry by the Japanese government led to the unification of various organs in China in order to strengthen assistance to the National Government, it was decided to promote the general and in-depth Sino-Japanese cooperation policy. Immediately after the Chairman's second visit to Japan at the end of last year, this administrative reform took the opportunity of the war to establish the National Government's combat posture. In the military, political, and economic aspects, the National Government's administrative combat organs for full cooperation with Japan were established to bravely move forward in order to complete the mission of the Greater East Asia War.

<h3 id="e20">The Wartime Polity in North China <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>"[Beijing Special Dispatch, 8th]" The change of the chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission and the transfer of various supervisors, in order to adapt to the new situation after China's participation in the war, further promote the construction of North China, and promote the construction of the new China, is due to the new and vigorous vitality of the commissioners. At the same time, it can also be regarded as a political organization of a small number of elites, so the significance is extremely important.</p>
<p>China's participation in the war on the 9th of last month has historical significance. Since the publication of the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration and Agreement, the advancement of the North China Political Affairs Committee has been awaited in order to make leaps and bounds in North China's political power. Former Chairman Wang has made remarkable contributions to the construction of North China over the past two years. He has retreated bravely, and the new camp of the North China Political Affairs Committee in the new ideals has emerged. Before the historical stage of China's participation in the war, great expectations are placed on how Commissioner Zhu Shen and others will use their means.</p>
<p>Due to China's participation in the war, the relationship between Japan and China has been further strengthened and deepened. The National Government's relationship with the North China Political Affairs Committee, North China's participation in the National Economic Committee and the New National Movement Promotion Association, Chairman Wang's assumption of the title of Honorary Chairman of the New People's Association, the abolition of the Five-Colored Flag, etc., many outstanding issues between the central government and North China have been rapidly adjusted. After the strength of North China joined the National Government and a close connection was established, the establishment of China's wartime attitude has progressed more and more. At the same time, in the North China region, in order to adapt to the new relationship between Japan and China, it is planned to make the North China Political Affairs Committee have a more leap-forward expansion and strengthening. In this decisive stage, if we want to complete the important mission of establishing security and serving as a logistical base for Greater East Asia, we cannot but exert a strong political force. Therefore, the reorganization of institutions, the adjustment of the situation in various administrative departments, and other concrete policies all depend on Commissioner Zhu Shen to rapidly realize after his assumption of office.</p>
<p>During the decisive period, the biggest task of the North China authorities is to increase the production of important national defense resources based on the relationship between Japan and China sharing weal and woe, in order to enhance combat power. The completion and victory of the Greater East Asia War is hopeful. The implementation of policies to stabilize people's livelihoods, such as dealing with the price problem, establishing security, and solving the food problem, is a necessary prerequisite. How the North China Political Affairs Committee will exert its political power in the future and the responsibilities of Commissioner Zhu Shen and others of the new North China authorities are extremely important. We cannot help but look forward to how they will show their talents in the construction of the new China. (Translated from the February 10th issue of the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3 id="e21">Explanation by Information Vice-Chief Okumura: The Current State of Friction within the Enemy's Internal Affairs <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>"[Tokyo, 15th, Central News Agency]" Japanese House of Representatives member Shinzo Imai asked this afternoon in the House Budget Committee about the friction between the United Kingdom and the United States and within the enemy's internal affairs. The answer was given by Information Bureau Vice-Chief Okumura. The main points are as follows: At the beginning of the war, the three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy renewed their alliance, establishing a close and powerful partnership. On the other hand, the United Kingdom and the United States seem to have close contact on the surface, but in fact, there is no unity. This is because the war aims of the United States and the United Kingdom are fundamentally different. It goes without saying that the war guidance strategies between the two countries are different, and their war aims are not necessarily the same. Let me give a few examples to illustrate this. For example, British Prime Minister Churchill said in his speech on November 10th last year that the United Kingdom is now fighting for its national destiny. If we analyze this statement in detail, we can see that the war aims of the United Kingdom, from the perspective of dominating the world for two hundred years, are to maintain the old British-style order at all times, that is, they are fighting to maintain the status quo of the British Empire's world order. Therefore, it is imperative that the British people pay sacrifices. Shortly after Churchill's speech, American Wendell Willkie also gave a speech. Willkie was one of the people who competed with Roosevelt for the Republican presidential candidate. At first glance, it seems that the views of the Republican leader are opposed to Roosevelt's views. In fact, today's Willkie is calling for further attacks on Japan externally. It can even be said that he is more stubborn than Roosevelt. He once served as Roosevelt's private special envoy in the autumn of last year to visit Egypt, Turkey, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing, and engaged in various activities. Therefore, his views on external issues are completely consistent with Roosevelt's. In his speech, he once said that the American people are now fighting with a major sacrifice, not as British Churchill said, to maintain British order in the world, nor to preserve this British Empire in the world, but to break this old world order and build a free union of nations. This is to refute Churchill's speech on the surface, so a huge wave occurred among the American people. As for the so-called democratic goals of the United States, since World War I, it has been trying to seize the world's power and manipulate countries as it wishes, centered on itself. Now, it is trying to complete its ambition to dominate the world in this war. For example, the United States set up the Anglo-American Joint Chiefs of Staff and various committees on the allocation of war materials in Washington, and pulled South American countries into its camp under its control. It also used the military lease agreement to interfere in Europe and India. It also sent large armies to Australia, India, the Pacific Islands, and South America. However, the British, who respect tradition, have a deep sense of aversion to the actions of the American army, which not only stationed troops on British territory, but also acted as if there was no one there. Also, Knox in the United Kingdom once told reporters that the air bases used by the American army in the Pacific Islands and other parts of the world are managed by the United States, which has caused various discussions. Even members of parliament have questioned Eden about this matter, which shows that the war aims of the United Kingdom and the United States are fundamentally inconsistent. The reason is that the fundamental contradictions arising from the different war aims of the United Kingdom and the United States not only cause discussions among the authorities of the two countries, but also discussions among the people of the two countries on the strategic importance of the European and Pacific fronts and the strategies for resolving the Indian issue. The United Kingdom hopes that India will maintain its past state, but the United States opposes the United Kingdom's policy toward India across the board, and various problems have also arisen on this point. Also, regarding the relationship between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union has not fully understood the United Kingdom and the United States, because the United Kingdom and the United States do not hope that the Union will advance toward Europe. However, given that if the Soviet Union fails, the German army will inevitably turn to attack the United Kingdom and the United States, so it is well known that they are using the Soviet Union against Germany. The Soviet side also has the same imagination about mutual use, but contradictions arise again on specific issues. The Soviet Union also hoped that the United Kingdom and the United States would launch a second front in Europe. When the British and American armies landed in North Africa, the authorities of the two countries made great efforts to claim that this was the fulfillment of the second front agreed with the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union was also dissatisfied with this. Finally, regarding the relationship between the United Kingdom, the United States, and Chongqing, Chongqing has become a darling of the anti-Axis powers in the half year since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and has been greatly flattered by the United Kingdom and the United States. This is because Chongqing has changed to become one of the British and American fronts, and is also their base for attacking Japan. However, the transportation lines for the United Kingdom and the United States to aid Chongqing have been completely occupied by the Japanese army, so the materials for their aid to Chongqing have been cut off. Recently, the United Kingdom and the United States have only supplied Chongqing with a small number of armaments by air from Africa via India. Therefore, Chongqing has expressed deep dissatisfaction with the lack of practical assistance from the United Kingdom and the United States. The Chongqing ambassador to the United States has questioned the United States about this matter, and the deterioration of their relationship is not difficult to see from this.</p>

<p>Chairman's Address</p>

I believe everyone is well aware of the significance of this rally. We must know our individual positions, understand our responsibilities, and work together for the Greater East Asian nations. We, the young and old, are all masters of the Greater East Asian nations. Knowing our responsibilities, we must strive to achieve liberation and forever eliminate foreign aggressor forces. My words today are simple: I hope that from now on, everyone will take on the responsibilities they should bear, understand their own positions, fulfill their own duties, and strive to move towards the path of defending East Asia."</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>"Dear fellow citizens, today we are holding a demonstration rally to support the Republic of China's declaration of war against England and America in the Racecourse of the Public Concession, which is about to be recovered. I firmly believe that everyone must feel infinite excitement and joy. Why did the National Government declare war against England and America? Because they were the first imperialists to invade China. China has been reduced to a semi-colony, has lost much land and national sovereignty, and even the Chinese people have been subjected to international inequality and discrimination, all because of the evils of England and America. Today, all of you participating in this demonstration rally, in addition to remembering the loss of territorial sovereignty, should also remember that Chinese people were previously unable to set foot in the Bund Park. Before December 8th of the year before last, we could not even go to the stands of today's Racecourse, nor could we be invited to the clubs on the Bund. For the sake of justice, for the sake of conscience, for the sake of dignity, and for the sake of national sovereignty, we resolutely declared war against England and America. Why did the National Government declare war against England and America? Because Japan has already raised the banner of righteousness on December 8th of the year before last and launched the Greater East Asia War. This war is for the liberation of all of East Asia, and it is for the co-prosperity of East Asia. We are a member of Greater East Asia and should participate in this most meaningful liberation cause in history. We must cooperate and work hand in hand with Japan forever to defend East Asia, and we should also work together to achieve the goal of building Greater East Asia. For the sake of justice, for the sake of conscience, for the sake of friendship, and for the sake of responsibility, we resolutely declared war against England and America. Why did the National Government declare war against England and America? Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the people of the whole country have been extremely excited. Whether they are government officials, farmers, workers, businessmen, women, or students, they have continuously expressed to the government their hope to participate in the war and have been constantly looking forward to everyone doing their best to contribute to the war of liberation. Everyone has the same heart, and everyone thinks the same way. Because of justice, conscience, public opinion, and heavenly duty, we resolutely declared war against England and America. China has already declared war. What should we do in the future?</p>
<p>We must quickly organize and train the people. Why was China so weak in the past? Because the people did not have a sound organization and did not have strong training, so they were easily oppressed and deceived by imperialists. We have suffered too deeply for a hundred years. We must use one ideology and one leader to organize and train the people to ensure the security of the rear, and we should also be prepared to leave for the front at any time to participate in this great war in history. We must also quickly ensure and increase production. Today's war is a total war, and it is also a total war of manpower and material resources. There is a distinction between the front and the rear on the battlefield, but there is no distinction between the front and the rear in the war. Ensuring production is ensuring the victory of the war, and increasing production is increasing the strength of the war. We are preparing to participate in the war with manpower, and we must especially immediately increase material resources to contribute to the war. Dear fellow compatriots, this declaration of war is for the sake of justice, for the sake of conscience, for the sake of dignity, for the sake of national sovereignty, for the sake of friendship, for the sake of responsibility, for the sake of public opinion, and for the sake of heavenly duty. We never hope for rewards, and we do not ask for conditions. If we hope for rewards and conditions, the liberation and freedom of all of East Asia are our rewards and conditions. We thank Japan and Italy for returning the concessions and abolishing extraterritoriality, but we will never ask for them. We only hope to be able to contribute manpower and material resources to the Greater East Asia War, so as to fulfill our heavenly duty and responsibility. To revive China, we must overthrow England and America. To defend East Asia, we must cooperate with Japan. Let us single-mindedly engage in war, and let us bravely move forward!"</p>
<p>Minister Lin's Speech</p>
<p>Minister Lin Baisheng's speech roughly stated: "Today is the first time that the National Military Commission has convened a meeting since the declaration of war. It is also the anniversary of the fall of Singapore. At the same time, the people of all circles in Shanghai are holding a grand demonstration rally to support the Central Government's participation in the war, defend East Asia, and expel British and American imperialism. For more than a hundred years, China has suffered the aggression of Britain and America in all aspects. Therefore, Britain and America are truly China's only enemies. If it were not for our friendly nation Japan, China would have perished long ago, and there would be no so-called East Asia. Based on this point, China and Japan are truly interdependent. Britain and America are afraid of the true cooperation between China and Japan, so for decades, they have done their best to sow discord. Now we have formally declared war on England and America to settle the blood debt of more than a hundred years. From now on, we will be able to truly obtain freedom and equality. Some people doubt whether we have the strength to participate in the war. Then, I will answer you. We have hands and feet, and even more so, we have the hearts of hundreds of millions of people working together. We must strive to build Greater East Asia. Only with East Asia can we have a country, and only with a country can we have us. Today, in this environment, people feel that prices are high and people are struggling to make a living. This is actually the result of a small number of corrupt officials and most speculators hoarding goods and manipulating prices. We must eliminate them, so that China can be revitalized."</p>
<p>Guest Speech</p>
<p>The original speech by Minister Tani, from the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office, said: "Today, I am able to personally witness the enthusiastic emotions of 100,000 Chinese comrades in Shanghai, the largest base of British and American aggression in East Asia for a hundred years, shouting slogans to overthrow England and America and support participation in the war. At the same time, I feel that the British and American bases in East Asia have been completely destroyed by our East Asian nations. I cannot help but have profound feelings about this. Recalling the friendly relations between China and Japan throughout history, it is the ambition of England and America to dominate East Asia that has hindered the mutual understanding and the establishment of friendly relations between the peoples of China and Japan. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the ambitions of England and America have been shattered, and England and America, who have hindered the friendship between China and Japan, have been driven away by us. Moreover, with the participation of the Reformed National Government in the war, the relationship between China and Japan has in fact become one of comrades in arms, standing on the fate of intertwined interests. Now, the opportunity has officially arrived for China and Japan to work together to realize the ideal of 'Pan-Asianism.'</p>
<p>At present, our 100 million people are sparing no sacrifice to break away from the shackles of England and America and build a new East Asian world with an ideal state of co-existence and co-prosperity. The front and the rear have become one, shedding blood and sweat together. Since the Chinese people are participating in the war to destroy England and America, they must also uphold firm ideals and be Japan's comrades in arms, strengthening the determination and effort to participate in the war to the end. We now only have to devote all our strength to the war until the final victory of Sino-Japanese cooperation is achieved.</p>
<p>I feel that the Chinese people have never been asked so urgently and practically to exert their strength for East Asia. This time, I hope that you can deeply realize the great and glorious responsibilities you bear and strive for China."</p>
<p>Rally Telegram</p>
<p>Respectfully to Chairman Wang of the National Government, all members of the Central Political Conference and the Supreme National Defense Conference, ministers of various departments and commissions, provincial governors and mayors, commanders of various armies, newspaper offices, and domestic and overseas people's organizations: The imperialists of England and America have invaded East Asia, and our people have endured humiliation and pain for a hundred years. The people of Shanghai have suffered even more. Heaven is fair, and extremes must be reversed. With the rise of the Greater East Asia War, our friendly nation, Japan, has fought valiantly and achieved victories everywhere, driving out the British and American soldiers and recovering their strongholds. The final victory depends on the unity and coordination of the East Asian nations. Our supreme leader and the gentlemen of the National Government, with foresight and insight into the times, resolutely ordered the declaration of war against England and America on January 9th. The people of the whole country, hearing the news, rose up with enthusiasm and shared the same hatred, vowing to do their best to repay the country, assist our allies, eliminate the rebels in East Asia, and wash away a hundred years of shame. Our five million compatriots in Shanghai have long been preparing for the worst and sharpening their swords. Now, when it is time to risk our lives for survival, it is time for every man to fulfill his responsibilities. We hereby hold a demonstration rally today to support participation in the war and overthrow England and America, determined to uphold the righteousness of loving China and loving East Asia, and to support and respond to the call. We hope that our compatriots at home and abroad will work together and mobilize as a whole, so as to complete the Greater East Asia War as soon as possible, to free the oppressed nations from suffering, and to achieve co-existence and co-prosperity from now on, realizing the Father of the Nation's Pan-Asianism. We are extremely excited to send this telegram. Respectfully, by the Shanghai Special Municipal Citizens' Rally to Support Participation in the War and Overthrow England and America, with over 200,000 participants.</p>

<p>Special Collection on Various Places in Southeast Asia, Part Two (Part 1)</p>
<h3 id="e28">Southeast Asia, Treasure Trove of Greater East Asia <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— Voter</p>
<p>The forces of British and American imperialism have begun a general retreat in the Pacific. The countries of Southeast Asia are beginning to break free from 300 years of humiliating fate. Under the supreme principle of "national self-determination," they are preparing to write a new history of Southeast Asia for their own destiny.</p>
<p>General situation</p>
<p>The modern meaning of Southeast Asia is not the geographical Southeast Asia, but the Southeast Asia that has close political and economic relations with China and Japan. This should include the former Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, the former British Malaya, British Borneo, Thailand, French Indochina—Vietnam—and the tropical islands scattered in the southwestern Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>(Note: Geographically, Southeast Asia refers to the entire coast of the tropical region, from the eastern coast of Africa to the western coast of South America.)</p>
<p>The total area of Southeast Asia is approximately 3.82 million square kilometers, which is about 5.6 times more than the total area of Japan (including Taiwan, Korea, and Sakhalin), which is 680,000 square kilometers. Compared to the total area of China, which is 12,042,973 square kilometers, it accounts for about one-third. The total population is approximately 130 million, which is more than the total population of Japan (1935 survey), which is 98 million, and also accounts for about one-third of the total population of China (1933 Ministry of Interior Statistics Monthly Report), which is 489,155,389. However, in terms of population density, Southeast Asia has a population of only 33.97 per square kilometer, which is not much different from China's more than 40 people per square kilometer. However, like China, the population density in Southeast Asia is also uneven. For example, Java, which has a high population density, has approximately 313 people per square kilometer, while neighboring Sumatra has only one person, Celebes has 22, former Dutch Borneo has four, and former Dutch New Guinea has one. From this, it can be seen that there are still vast areas that have not been developed.</p>
<p>The area, population, and density of each country in Southeast Asia are compared with China and Japan as follows: Generally speaking, the countries of Southeast Asia are agricultural countries. However, tin and other mineral resources are also very abundant, so the conditions for industrialization have long been met. In addition, forestry and fishery are also quite developed.</p>
<p>Agricultural Resources</p>
<p>Due to the strong sunlight and abundant rainfall, coupled with the fertile soil, agriculture in Southeast Asian countries has the most superior conditions for cultivating agricultural products. For example, rice can be harvested three times a year in many areas. Looking at the production of major agricultural products in various countries in recent years, the ratio of their exports to the world's production is as follows:</p>
<p>Rubber is mainly produced in Malaya and the East Indies, accounting for 90% of the world's total production. The rubber production of various places in Southeast Asia can be tabulated as follows: (Unit: tons)</p>
<p>After 1929, due to overproduction and a sharp drop in prices, Southeast Asian rubber was on the verge of bankruptcy. In 1934, the International Rubber Investigation Committee was established, which stipulated the basic production quantities and exportable quantities of various producing countries. Needless to say, this was a completely unfair method under conditions that favored several powerful countries.</p>
<p>Southeast Asian sugar production areas are the East Indies and the Philippines. Vietnam has small-scale sugar production, and Thailand has also seen a new trend in recent years. The ratio of sugar production in the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines to the world's total production is as follows: (Unit: 1,000 quintals)</p>
<p>Coconuts are produced all over Southeast Asia. Exports of dried coconut account for 75% of the world's total exports. Oil coconuts are produced in Malaya and the East Indies. The production and export volume of coconuts in various places is as follows: (Unit: 1,000 quintals)</p>
<p>World quinine production is, in fact, mainly in the East Indies and British India, accounting for almost all of it. The comparison of Southeast Asian production with world production is as follows: (Unit: tons – 1,000 kg)</p>
<p>The hard fibers produced in various places in Southeast Asia are Manila hemp, etc. The main producing area is the Philippines. Northern Borneo and Sumatra and the East Indies also produce considerable amounts. The table below shows the position of hard fiber exports from various places in the world's exports: (Unit: 1,000 tons)</p>
<p>Kapok is an important agricultural resource in Southeast Asia, second only to rubber, supplying most of the world's consumption. The table below shows its position in the world in terms of export volume: (Unit: tons - 1,000 kg)</p>
<p>Rice is the main food for Asians, and the abundance of rice production in Southeast Asia cannot be ignored. The export volume of rice produced in Vietnam and Thailand is particularly amazing. The production volume in various places is as follows: (Unit: 1,000 kg)</p>
<p>In addition, the production of coffee, tea, tobacco, etc. in Southeast Asia is as follows:</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's budget for this year has already been developed, with increases in both revenue and expenditure. Most of the regular income items are underestimated to accommodate possible unfavorable situations in future tax revenue. The budget is as follows:</p>
<p>Excluding the surplus of 428,850 yuan from last year, the net increase is 84,269,050 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Summary Explanation of Various Regular Expenditures <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The method of preparing the regular income budget for this year is roughly the same as last year. Most income items are underestimated to accommodate possible unfavorable situations in future tax revenue. A summary explanation of each income item is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Land Tax: Referring to the above table, the land tax revenue for this year is estimated at 20,707,000 yuan. The land tax for this year will still be levied at 2.5% of the assessed value of the land, the same as the second half of last year. Council properties and tax-exempt properties are not included. The assessed value of the land used as the basis for taxation will remain the same as last year's assessment. The new assessment is temporarily postponed. This year's estimated revenue for this item is underestimated by 20% to leave room for any unfavorable situations in tax revenue.</p>
<p>(2) General Municipal Rate on Western-Style Houses (House Rate)</p>
<p>The estimated revenue for this item this year is 23,250,000 yuan. The rate is still 50% of the assessed rental value of Western-style houses. Council properties, tax-exempt properties, and non-income-generating houses are not included. The assessed rental value used as the basis for collecting the rate is the same as last year's and has not changed. The new assessment is temporarily postponed. This year's estimated revenue for this item is underestimated by 30% to leave room for any unfavorable situations in tax revenue.</p>
<p>(3) General Municipal Rate on Chinese-Style Houses (House Rate)</p>
<p>The estimated revenue for this item this year is 15,575,000 yuan. The collection method is the same as for Western-style houses. The total estimated revenue is underestimated by 25%.</p>
<p>(4) Special Municipal Rate: The estimated revenue for this item is 161,000 yuan, of which 160,000 yuan is for Western-style houses and 1,000 yuan is for Chinese-style houses. Because the scope of collection is limited to areas outside the railway line, the total estimated revenue is much lower than other budget items.</p>
<p>(5) Special Advertising Rate: The estimated revenue for this item is 125,000 yuan, an increase of 45,000 yuan compared to last year's budget. The reason for the increase is the increase in the rate.</p>
<p>(6) Wharfage Dues: The revenue for this item is difficult to predict and depends on commercial conditions. The estimated revenue for this year is 250,000 yuan, purely a nominal amount.</p>
<p>(7) License Fees: The estimated revenue for this item this year is 15,662,900 yuan. The revenue from various license fees depends on the activity of industry and commerce in this port and cannot be entirely based on last year's revenue. Therefore, the method of preparing the budget is the same as last year.</p>
<p>(8) Council Property Rental Income: The estimated revenue for this item this year is 2,250,000 yuan. Fees paid by ships using the Council's Bund floating pier are the largest source of revenue under this item. The remaining part is estimated from higher rental income from Council properties such as slaughterhouses.</p>
<p>(9) Public Utility and Council-Operated Enterprise Revenue: The estimated revenue for this item this year is 12,000,000 yuan, most of which is the franchise operating fee paid by the public utility companies. However, the franchise operating fee of the Shanghai West Electricity Company is now paid to the relevant authorities in that district and is not included. The remaining part is the income from the electric tram company in the two concessions, as well as the estimated income from the Council-operated enterprises.</p>
<p>(10) Amusement Tax: The estimated revenue for this item this year is 9,000,000 yuan. The tax rate is still 30%, the same as in the past.</p>
<p>(11) Permit Fees: The source of revenue for this item is the issuance of various movement permits. The estimated revenue for this year is 3,950,000 yuan. (To be continued)</p>

During this period, he has held discussions with military and political authorities and economic magnates from China and Japan. He is scheduled to go to Beijing on the 16th for a three-day stay, where he is expected to meet with officials from the National Government, the Japanese Expeditionary Army Headquarters in China, the Embassy, and important figures in the financial world to hold discussions.

<p>The Shanghai Pacification Association is actively promoting construction work in the pacification zone and sparing no effort. Although telephone service has been restored in the Nanhui district, it is still not possible to call Shanghai. Shanghai and Nanhui are far apart, and it is very inconvenient to travel back and forth in case of emergencies. It will order the Nanhui Special District Office to handle the matter. The office contacted the Central China Electric Communications Company, which was very satisfactory. After the line was connected, it was completed at the end of last month and direct calls are now available.</p>

<p>Japanese Friends Help with Scholarships: Deep Admiration for Profound Friendship and Consideration</p>
<p>Yesterday, we continued to receive donations of over seven thousand yuan, for which we are deeply grateful. In particular, Mr. Guo Zongxian forwarded over one hundred and sixty yuan from an anonymous Japanese friend as remuneration for helping Chinese people. We are especially touched by this noble friendship. This newspaper will certainly respect the generosity of all donors and allocate assistance prudently based on actual needs.</p>
<p>Business Community's Enthusiasm: Donations Made by Saving Expenses</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received: (1) A letter from the staff of Xiang Kang Native Bank, donating one thousand and seven yuan and fifty cents saved from Lunar New Year meals for scholarships; (2) Mr. Sun He generously contributed one thousand yuan, which was collected as congratulatory gifts for his son's one-month celebration, to be used for scholarships. Their enthusiasm is admirable.</p>
<p>Jing Xing Middle School: Benefiting Unsuccessful Scholarship Applicants</p>
<p>Yesterday, Jing Xing Middle School on Chengdu Road (Route Tenant de la Tour) sent a letter stating: "Having read in your newspaper the article 'Scholarship Students' that 'some unsuccessful applicants requested a re-examination, while others stood in front of the office crying...' anyone with a little sympathy could not help but sigh. Now, our school, with the support of school director Mr. Wu Shenzhi, who reallocated funds from his birthday celebration for scholarships, has donated five thousand yuan in national currency, designated for use as scholarships for needy students, to be distributed to ten students from each grade: Junior High 1, Senior High 1, and Senior High 2. We hope that your newspaper will select students from the unsuccessful applicants whose addresses are relatively close to our school for recommendation. Our school will waive all their tuition and miscellaneous fees, to show our humble intentions. If other schools follow suit and make donations, your newspaper's difficulty of 'too few monks and not enough porridge' will be alleviated." This school's act of benefiting needy students is deeply admirable. Those unsuccessful scholarship applicants (Junior High 2, Senior High 1, Senior High 2) whose addresses are near this school can send a letter to apply, and we will promptly issue a letter of recommendation.</p>

<p>The once-sensational Yin Yu mystery, since its revelation that the male and female protagonists were Yong merchant Xu [omitted name] Chang and female ballad singer Zui Yi Xian (i.e., Jin Yu Zhen), has attracted much social attention. In particular, Zui Yi Xian once commissioned lawyer Yu Xiangqin to publish advertisements in various newspapers. Subsequently, Yu Xiangqin invited both parties to meet and talk several times at his office on Weihaiwei Road. According to reliable sources from the Da Tong News Agency, the two protagonists of the Yin Yu affair have now reconciled. It is said that their separation and reunion were entirely voluntary.</p>

<p>The Japanese Shanghai Naval Attaché's Office Rehabilitation Department, after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, used names such as the Naval Rehabilitation Department to work diligently on Shanghai's rehabilitation and reconstruction. Now, to adapt to the changing circumstances, it has been decided to rename it the Shanghai Naval Attaché's Office Supervisory Division from February 15th, in order to improve efficiency. The tasks previously undertaken by the Naval Rehabilitation Department will be temporarily fully inherited and handled by the newly established Supervisory Division. The Japanese Fleet Press Department in China announced on the 15th that the Shanghai Naval Attaché's Office Rehabilitation Department would be renamed the Shanghai Naval Attaché's Office Supervisory Division from the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Prices of Fresh Meat and Vegetables Soar: Associations Will Assist Authorities to Combat This <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>The English-language "North China Daily News" reports that, just as the authorities in charge of price controls are researching ways to restrain the rising prices of food, meat and vegetable prices jumped sharply again in the market yesterday.</p>
<p>Astonishing Rise in Fresh Meat Prices</p>
<p>This morning, the various markets in this city showed a shortage of fresh meat. By the afternoon, however, stocks reappeared, but by that time, due to the increased prices, most vendors had no pork to sell. At the same time, mutton was also difficult to buy, and what was available was priced higher than on Saturday.</p>
<p>Stringent Measures Expected to Be Implemented</p>
<p>Vegetable prices have also increased, and egg prices continue to rise. Meanwhile, according to well-informed sources, the authorities will soon implement stringent measures to crack down on all those who raise prices. From now on, merchants will not have the opportunity to reap windfall profits. According to their explanation, this ideal is based on the recent organization of trade associations in various industries. With the assistance of these organizations, prices can be stabilized. Since the Lunar New Year holiday, prices of various commodities (especially food) have continued to rise. According to commercial sources, the increase in prices is due to manipulation by unscrupulous profiteers and hoarders. It is believed that once the authorities take stringent measures, prices will fall significantly. It has also been pointed out that transactions in various markets have ceased.</p>

The directors of all collection bureaus attended and participated in the discussion. The meeting began with a speech by the director of the Income Tax Department, Qiu Fangbo, explaining the significance of convening the meeting. Each collection bureau director then reported on the actual situation of promoting tax policy last year and offered suggestions for future improvements, along with proposals for discussion. All important proposals will be discussed further today (the 16th) and then announced and published in full.</p>

<p>According to reporters from Da Tong News Agency, traffic between Shanghai and Shaoxing is now open because the bus route from Shaoxing to Xiaoshan has been extended to the Hangzhou City Railway Station, connecting with the Shanghai-Hangzhou train. However, passengers must walk across the Qiantang River Bridge. Travelers going from Shanghai to Shaoxing can take the train to Hangzhou and then take a bus from the City Railway Station directly to Shaoxing. Therefore, the journey between Shanghai and Shaoxing can now be completed in one day.</p>

<p>The two sons of the late antique tycoon Wen Yuanzhai's owner Li Wenqing, namely Li Lingyun and Li Linghan, residing at number 70 Furieli Road, have recently been sued in the Second Special Court by their stepmother, Li Feiyun, represented by lawyers Tang Xingjian and Mao Lin. The complaint alleges that since the plaintiff's husband passed away in the United States, leaving behind tens of millions in assets, all daily living expenses have been provided by the two sons. For several years, all was well, but the two sons gradually tricked the plaintiff out of all her jade and diamond rings and other jewelry. When asked to return them, they not only refused but also abandoned her. Therefore, the plaintiff requests a summons to investigate and requests a judgment ordering a one-time payment of 300,000 yuan in alimony. After being notified, the hearing has been rescheduled for further review. Yesterday, the two defendants, accompanied by their defense lawyer, were summoned and appeared in court. They stated that the plaintiff was a prostitute. Their father, when young, frequented brothels and became intimate with the plaintiff, renting a house to cohabit with her, but never taking her as a concubine. Last year, she was in poverty and asked merchants to subsidize her with fifty yuan per month. Therefore, the merchants commissioned a bank employee and lawyer Liu Xu to witness and draw up an agreement, with the payments being made regularly each month.

<p>Last year, on the eve of the Lunar New Year (i.e., February 4th), a robbery and murder occurred at the Japanese-owned Song Yong Watch Company at 1287 North Sichuan Road. The shop owner, Song Yong Huangxi, his wife, Kaniya, and a Chinese maid were all killed with an iron hammer, and over fifty watches worth more than 10,000 Japanese yen were stolen. The investigation team has now solved the case and arrested the murderer, Yu Yincai, a native of Ningbo. When Yu was arrested, detective A was also injured in the head by Yu with an iron hammer. Details were reported on the 13th. Yesterday, the Nong Police Department transferred the suspect Yu to the First Criminal Division of the First Special Court. A representative of the Police Department stated that because many of the stolen goods are still missing, they request permission to detain him for two weeks. Yu is tall and strong. He confessed that he usually gambles in gambling dens in places like Lubaoxi Garden, Haining, and Xinzha. He often passed by the watch shop. Seeing that there was a Japanese woman in the shop, he planned to steal a few watches to use as gambling money that morning, as he did not intend to gamble. Unexpectedly, he was seen by the Chinese maid, so he grabbed the iron hammer in the room and killed her. Then the shop owner's wife arrived and shouted loudly, so he killed her in the same way. The shop owner heard the noise and came downstairs. Seeing him, he shouted "Thief!" so he had no choice but to hit him as well. After verifying the confession in court, the court ordered Yu to be detained for another two weeks for further questioning.</p>

<p>The New Enemy Property Committee is handling applications for the disposal of remaining enemy property. All deeds registered with the British, American, and other enemy consulates, where the ownership belongs to Chinese or neutral nationals, have successively applied to the committee for the removal of enemy property status and have processed the conversion of Japanese-registered deeds and ownership certificates with the designated Central China Revitalization Co., Ltd., Nomura Trust Co., Ltd., Yasuda Trust Co., Ltd., Taihe Bank, East Asia Development Co., Ltd., Xinjiao Real Estate Co., Ltd., and Hengchan Co., Ltd. The deadline for applying for the removal of enemy property status was February 9th. It is reported that Hengchan Co., Ltd. has received the most entrustments for applications for removal. Deeds that have been approved for removal of enemy property status are now permitted to be mortgaged for cash at banks and native banks, and the sale and trading of deeds are restored. Previously, banks and native banks had stopped accepting deeds as collateral due to their registration as enemy property. Now, for deeds that have been removed from enemy property status, they are allowed to be accepted for mortgages. At the same time, the Banking Joint Reserve Council and the Native Bank Joint Reserve have approved member banks and native banks to use deeds that have been removed from enemy property status as collateral to apply for loans according to law. It is also reported that the Central Reserve Bank, Japanese banks, Chinese banks, and the seven companies handling the removal of enemy property are willing to jointly handle deed mortgage business.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Establishing the Shen Bao Readers' Library <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Ping</p>
<p>Shanghai needs a library truly suitable for professionals and students. Establishing a library through the Shen Bao Readers' Week and throughout the city is most appropriate. Here are a few suggestions for reference by all sectors:</p>
<p>(1) Name it the "Shen Bao Readers' Library" to commemorate the Shen Bao's contribution to society.</p>
<p>(2) The establishment funds can be raised through donations. The best way is for the Shen Bao to emulate the Scholarship Fund method and vigorously promote the importance of establishing this library in the newspaper, which will surely attract many enthusiastic and respectable donors. All income should be managed by the Shen Bao Social Service Department, inviting truly impartial individuals from society to form a committee for safekeeping and management. The accounts and a list of donors should be published in a special "Library News" section in the Shen Bao. Donors of 30 yuan or more will receive a one-year borrowing card, donors of 50 yuan or more will receive a two-year borrowing card, 100 yuan or more will receive a three-year card, and 200 yuan or more will receive a lifetime card.</p>
<p>(3) Those who do not donate money but wish to join the library can donate three or more books (at least 70% new) worth more than 25 yuan. The book price will be calculated at 150% of the price on the book's copyright page (the issued borrowing card will be valid for one year; those worth 40 yuan or more will have a two-year card; 80 yuan or more, three years; 150 yuan or more, lifetime). A list of donors, along with the book names, authors, and publishers, will be published in the Shen Bao Library News section to prevent re-donation of the same book (donations of English books will be limited to one for the time being). All books must be reviewed by the library staff, who have the right to refuse acceptance if they deem them unqualified. However, all formal and beneficial books, especially those related to small industries, agriculture (including horticulture, animal husbandry, fruits and vegetables, afforestation, etc.), and necessary medical knowledge and scientific knowledge, are considered qualified.</p>
<p>(4) Those who wish to join the library later but have no books to donate can apply the donation method listed in point one. As for laborers, servants, apprentices, and other classes with aspirations for self-improvement who wish to join the library, we certainly welcome them most warmly. However, most of them do not have the ability to meet the requirements of point one or two, meaning they have neither money nor books. The method for them to join the library should also be carefully considered.</p>
<p>(5) The Baojia system is now well-managed, and tracking an individual's whereabouts is easy. Therefore, those who wish to join must first fill out a library registration form, stating their citizen ID number, name, place of origin, age, address, Baojia district, occupation (category and location or school name and address), and attach a photo to the form. The librarian will verify the information against the citizen ID to ensure accuracy before approving the application. This eliminates the need for guarantors and prevents troublemakers. It is best to cooperate with the Baojia office to address those who might exploit opportunities such as moving or leaving Shanghai to embezzle books.</p>
<p>(6) Opening hours will be from 4:00 PM to 9:00 PM daily. Sundays and all holidays will be open all day. Saturdays will be open from 1:00 PM to 9:00 PM to allow students and staff ample time to exchange books.</p>
<p>(7) Each borrower will be allowed to borrow two books initially. As the book collection grows, this may be increased to three or four books. The borrowing period is ten days and cannot be extended. Books can be renewed for ten days, otherwise a fine of one jiao per day will be charged, with all fines going into the library's fund.</p>
<p>(8) Following the example of the Shanghai Municipal Council Public Library, borrowers can enter the library and choose books themselves. Once they find what they like, they can take it to borrow without having to fill out a book request slip. Borrowed books should be carefully protected. If they are damaged or lost, the librarian will impose a fine or require compensation for a new book. To avoid disputes, outside objects and books are not allowed to be brought into the library.</p>
<p>(9) When the library needs to notify borrowers of something, in addition to posting announcements in the library, it will also be published in the Shen Bao Library News section.</p>
<p>(10) As for the librarians, the Shen Bao Social Service Group will announce a test in the newspaper to select them. Those who aspire to be librarians can register with the department to take the test. Salaries will be drawn from the donations, so there cannot be too many librarians, about four should be sufficient. After the librarians are hired, the Social Service Department will invite an experienced librarian to work with the library director (selected from the best of the librarians) to find and decorate the library location. All expenses will be drawn from the donations.</p>
<h3 id="e47">An Open Letter to All Scholarship Applicants <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Colleagues of the Scholarship Fund Office</p>
<p>To all our dear students:</p>
<p>The Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund has been held for four sessions. Now, as this session's scholarship work comes to an end and you students return to your classrooms, we would like to say a few words to you:</p>
<p>This session's scholarship applications began on January 15th, and the approvals for the elementary, junior high, senior high, university, and vocational groups were announced by February 14th. In one month, we received over 300,000 yuan in scholarships from all sectors of society. With the guidance of the Scholarship Fund Committee: St. John's University President Shen Silang, Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese Education Department Director Chen Qingshi, World Book Company General Manager Lu Gaoyi, Shanghai Municipal Council Girls' School Principal Nie Lingyu, and vocational educator Zhao Zongyu, and the efforts of over fifty colleagues, we were able to complete the review of over 2,600 student applications. We, the colleagues, believe that we are mediocre, but we have followed the committee's instructions to thoroughly investigate the students' academic performance, conduct, and family circumstances. The most precious thing that students should cherish today is the compassion of all sectors of society, whether they save on their own expenses or offer encouragement and criticism. This supreme compassion should be an honorable impetus for students' character and studies.</p>
<p>(A) The number of scholarship applications registered this session was: 407 students in elementary school fifth grade, 354 students in elementary school sixth grade, 466 students in junior high first grade, 373 students in junior high second and third grades, 311 students in junior high third grade, 162 students in senior high first grade, 152 students in senior high second grade, 113 students in senior high third grade, 99 university students, and 5 vocational students. (B) The number of scholarships approved for this session was: 310 students in elementary school fifth grade, 209 students in elementary school sixth grade, 209 students in junior high first grade, 158 students in junior high second grade, 180 students in junior high third grade, 85 students in senior high first grade, 96 students in senior high second grade, 82 students in senior high third grade, 7 university students, and 4 vocational students. Those supported by fellow readers have not yet been listed and will be publicly announced and counted again when this session's scholarship work concludes. (C) The total amount of scholarships approved for this session was: elementary school 47,220.5 yuan, junior high 75,198 yuan, senior high 49,735 yuan, university 41,589 yuan, and vocational 4,141 yuan, totaling 217,883 yuan. This is the amount of scholarships issued as of the 12th. Subsequent reviews and allocations will be formally announced later.</p>
<p>Looking at the number of applications and the list of approvals, most have received assistance, and a portion are being reviewed. We would like to explain the standards we used for the review to you and also seek guidance from all sectors. The Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund aims to help outstanding students from needy families. It is neither a purely charitable endeavor nor a general scholarship program. Therefore, among the applicants, those who did not meet this standard, those who were not of good character, those whose academic performance was not excellent, those who did not graduate in order, those who were not diligent in their studies, and those [text missing], you should not [text missing]. On the one hand, you should repay society in the future, and on the other hand, you should work hard now. Mencius said, "Strain their muscles and bones, starve their bodies," and Yan Hui did not change his joy despite eating simple meals. These are what you should put into practice. The Analects says, "Ancient scholars studied for themselves, modern scholars study for others." This is the ambition you should have. "Cultivating oneself is indispensable, and learning must be persistent." This is the refinement you should strive for in your studies and conduct.</p>
<p>As for those students who were approved after review, their exam scores were relatively low. We took into consideration the amount of time they spend helping with household chores and the lack of opportunity for self-study. If they were not reviewed, they would be forced to drop out of school. Therefore, we re-evaluated them and provided appropriate assistance, hoping that their scores will improve in the next session.</p>
<p>In addition, we would like to explain the reasons for the rejection of those who were not selected: (1) Those whose family circumstances were proven to be acceptable after investigation; (2) Those whose academic performance was too poor and who failed this session's scholarship exam; (3) Those who were of poor character or who had been disciplined at school; (4) Those who applied but did not participate in the exam; (5) Those whose procedures were not prepared and were negligent; (6) Those whose information on the application form did not match the facts; (7) Those who had already received scholarships elsewhere. Those who violated the scholarship regulations of this newspaper were naturally ineligible for approval. As for those whose academic performance was slightly lower, even though they were not selected in this review, it will not affect their eligibility to apply next time. If they can improve their abilities, their performance in the next session will be remarkable. We hope to make a comparison and console you in the next session.</p>
<p>At this time of ongoing hardship and widespread difficulties, the revival of tomorrow's society depends on today's youth. Cultivating and supporting them is everyone's responsibility and obligation. We, the colleagues, bearing in mind the warning of not acting when seeing righteousness, and upholding the principle of human mutual assistance, appeal to society and pray to all sectors. The more we see and hear, the more earnest we become in our pleas. Re-reading the scholarship reports of the past month, the enthusiasm of millions of people and the blood and tears of over two thousand students leap off the page. Looking back on the past and anticipating the future, the number of students in need of assistance will gradually increase. This depends on the continued donations from those who contribute. The collection of over 300,000 yuan in this session shows the widespread readership of this newspaper and the deep sympathy and unanimous support for the scholarship movement. We, the colleagues, will redouble our efforts, respectfully fulfill our duties, and hope to repay everyone's kindness to the best of our ability with the future achievements of the students and the hard work of our colleagues. We respectfully submit this, and hope you students will work hard.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Colleagues of the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund Office</p>

<h3 id="e48">Last Night's Winter Relief Basketball Tournament Concludes Successfully – Red Team Defeats Xingren for Championship – Thirty-Five to Thirty… Tense Atmosphere on the Court <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday marked the final act of the Winter Relief Basketball Charity Tournament. The encounter between Xingren and the Red Team, two powerhouses of the Chinese army, made the program even more spectacular. The China Youth Gymnasium was packed. Mayor Chen Gongbo presided over the opening tip-off. In the first match, Xiqing faced the French Police. Xiqing was technically superior and took the lead in every aspect. They led 13-7 in the first half and ultimately triumphed with a score of 27-15. The French Police suffered three consecutive defeats, ending up in last place. After the first match, a charity ball auction was held, presided over by Bureau Chief Ling Xianwen. Ultimately, Li Xiao purchased the ball for the highest price of 16,000 yuan. Finally, Xingren and the Red Team entered the court. Xingren's Yu Ziji opened the scoring. After the Red Team's Tao Shaosheng scored a free throw, Xingren's Ziwangli also scored consecutive free throws. Although the Red Team's Bao Songyuan also made a free throw, Xingren took the lead. Subsequently, Ma Canxi scored a basket, and Bao Songyuan responded. Yu Ziji scored again, and Li Weisu also made a long shot. The scoring of both teams became balanced, but the Red Team remained behind by one point. After failing to surpass 8-6, Xingren's Guo Rong and Ziwangli scored three consecutive baskets, making it 14-6, turning the situation. The Red Team faced further misfortune when Li Zude scored, and Zhang Shaoqing was ejected for violently colliding with Wanli. Shortly after, Lin Wanli scored again, making it 16-8. This was Xingren's peak performance last night. Afterwards, Bao Songyuan made two free throws, and Tao Shaosheng scored two baskets, adding six points to the Red Team's score. The first half ended with a score of 18-14. After switching sides, the Red Team's offense intensified. Shaosheng scored a basket, and Songyuan made a free throw, closing the gap to just one point. Although Yu Ziji quickly scored a basket, Li Zude made a long shot. When Wanli made a free throw and Bao Songyuan made a basket, the score became tied at 20. Afterwards, Xingren was more closely guarded. Yu Yu fought hard to score a basket, but the Red Team's Tao Shaosheng tied the score at 23. Li Zude then put the Red Team ahead by one point with a score of 26-25. Songyuan and Yiqing responded in kind, making it 28-26. The Red Team finally took the lead again. At that moment, the atmosphere on the court was extremely tense. Lin Wanli lived up to his reputation, scoring two shots, giving Xingren a 30-28 lead. However, good times don't last, and good things are hard to come by again. In the last minute, Bao Songyuan tied the score at 30. Lao Bao then made another basket, putting the Red Team ahead for the third time. Xingren inevitably became flustered, and their plans went awry. Zude and He Xiaoguang added three more points, and the Red Team ultimately triumphed with a score of 35-30, winning the Winter Relief Charity Tournament championship.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Mainland Economy Improving – Tianjiri Discusses After Inspection Trip <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The Continental News reported on February 14th that Minister Tianjiri of the Shanghai Office of the Embassy departed from Shanghai on the 7th to inspect Nanjing, Luzhou, Bengbu, Anqing, and other inland areas. Having completed his official duties, he returned to Shanghai and met with reporters at the Broadway Mansions on the 13th to discuss the current issues of inland economic construction, the abolition of extraterritoriality, and the return of concessions. The main points were as follows:</p>
<p>The National Government's participation in the war, coupled with Japan's immediate declaration to return concessions, abolish extraterritorial rights in China, and transfer new enemy properties, as well as the National Government's efforts to strengthen its various strengths, has resulted in the National Government's political power growing stronger day by day. Economic leaders in the Shanghai concessions who previously held a wait-and-see attitude have also gradually changed their stance and cooperated in supporting the National Government. As this trend gradually penetrates the general public, it will further promote the strengthening of the National Government's political power. Recently, Chinese people in the mainland have made significant achievements in the economy. This is clear evidence of the Chinese people's initiative in assisting the National Government. Stabilizing the value of overseas Chinese currency is a prerequisite for economic construction. Regarding the relationship between Federal Reserve Notes and Central Reserve Bank Notes, there are various rumors circulating, but the decision has been made to do everything possible to maintain the value of Central Reserve Bank Notes. The previous return of new enemy properties by the Japanese side has been very effective in strengthening economic power. As for how to deal with new enemy properties in the future, the main focus should be on cultivating the National Government's combat power. The handling method will be nothing more than this. Regarding the issue of returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights, the Japanese-administered concessions should be returned first, followed by the public concessions and the French concessions. Therefore, economic recovery must come first. The inland economic situation after joining the war has greatly improved, especially with the opening of the Huai River. The development of Bengbu is particularly significant. The Chinese people there are very active in purchasing agricultural products. It is expected that Luzhou, Anqing, and other places will also gradually improve in the future.</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e52">The Premise of the Economic Sphere <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Generally speaking, the premise of the economic sphere lies in increasing the happiness of the nation and supporting the prosperity of society. However, the thoughts and actions of the economic sphere must take the environment as the scope of research. When discussing economics within the economic sphere, first, one must know what kind of country one is in; second, one must know what kind of era one is in; and third, one must know what kind of economic policy and economic facilities the country and the era should have.</p>
<p>In today's environment, we must recognize that China's economic sphere today belongs purely to the wartime economy. Therefore, the premise of China's economic sphere today lies in adopting an economic policy and economic facilities that align with the environment and needs of the Greater East Asia War era. The fundamental requirement of the wartime economy lies in the close cooperation between the government and the people.</p>
<p>Every move of the national economic sphere must take into account the lives of the people; every action of the private economic sphere must take into account the position of the government. These few essential words can be said to be the premise of China's economic sphere today in principle.</p>
<p>Starting today, this newspaper will present the "Economic Sphere" section to the readers. The premise of this newspaper's "Economic Sphere" is to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to understand and discuss the premise of China's economic sphere today. In other words, it is to take the premise of China's economic sphere as its premise. Therefore, in addition to regularly reporting economic news and statistics, this newspaper's "Economic Sphere" will, on the one hand, base its material for judging the Chinese economy on the current environmental situation, and on the other hand, base its data for discussing the Chinese economy on the principles of wartime economics. Finally, and equally important, this newspaper's "Economic Sphere" hopes to disclose as much as possible the opinions and statements of the economic sphere for public discussion and reference.</p>
<h3 id="e53">The Reviving National Government Economy (Part 1) – Trends in Close Economic Cooperation Between China and Japan <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>I. The Significance of National Government Economic Construction</p>
<p>The economic significance of the National Government's participation in the war can be said to be a great contribution to Japan. Of course, looking at the natural resources of North China at present, the contribution to Japan is indeed great. For example, the unlimited coal mines in Shanxi and Shandong provinces, the iron mines in Longyan, and the salt and cotton in Changlu and Shandong. The important role in strengthening Japan's national defense economy is self-evident and does not need to be re-evaluated. However, the supply of these strategic resources from North China is increasing daily, and the amount does not increase or decrease depending on whether or not the National Government participates in the war, so there is no need to discuss it further here. What has changed due to the participation in the war is the economy of Central China.</p>
<p>The economy of Central China is different from that of North China. At present, it is not possible to directly expect it to provide anything to Japan. Indeed, the cities along the coast of Central China are where almost the entire industrial production capacity of China is concentrated. However, these industries are mainly light industries such as textiles and flour, which cannot be directly used to enhance combat power. In addition, the strategic resources such as iron and coal are far inferior to those of North China. The largest industry in Central China, the light industry, has also been destroyed by the incident. Especially the industry in Shanghai, due to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and the subsequent severance of trade with third countries, has led to the closure of raw material sources and the difficulty in moving materials inland, resulting in a slump in productivity. Even with regard to agricultural products, leaving aside the military's local fundraising relationship for the time being, it is not easy to supply Japan. Therefore, the central task of the Central China economy, until today, is not so much to supply Japan as it is to restore the abandoned productivity and thereby strengthen its self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>This basic policy has not changed since joining the war. However, the strategy for reviving the Central China economy has become more and more advanced with the participation in the war as an opportunity. For example, actively expanding Sino-Japanese joint ventures, returning military-managed factories, and mobilizing other ethnic capital, reorganizing national policy companies and acquisition and distribution agencies, stabilizing commodity prices, and consolidating savings bonds, etc., are being carried out step by step. If these implementation strategies are effective, and if the stability of people's livelihood is realized by reviving the Central China economy, then its power will be as great as military force.</p>
<p>In a state of war, no country will have absolute happiness and comfort, which goes without saying. However, if a relatively stable and peaceful life appears in front of the people in the war zone, and it infiltrates the hearts of the people in the war zone on a wide scale, it will cause a sense of war-weariness.</p>
<p>In this sense, the economic significance of the National Government's participation in the war should not be immediately sought in supplying Japan, but should be seen in its future development and the impact it has on the people in the war zone. (Translated by Rong from the Tokyo Economist, January 27)</p>
<h3 id="e54">Price Management Agency in Chongqing <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>According to the International Economic Weekly, the highest authority for managing prices in Chongqing, which implements the Price Control Law, is the General Mobilization Conference. The conference has two departments: a design department and an operations department. The design department is a planning agency. The ministers of finance, military administration, economy, transportation, agriculture, forestry, society, and food administration, as well as the secretary-general of the General Mobilization Conference, are all standing members of the department. The president and vice-president of the Executive Yuan regularly convene these standing members to hold meetings and decide on all planning matters. The operations department is a practical working agency that is subordinate to the secretary-general. It has two divisions: general affairs and materials, as well as five groups: military affairs, human resources, financial resources, transportation, and inspection, which are responsible for handling various matters. The operations department can be said to be the central price management agency in terms of its functions. In addition, each province has a price management conference composed of the provincial chairman and representatives of various agencies, and each county has a price management agency based on the county government. Each accepts instructions from the superior authorities and implements price management matters. This is the general structure of the organization. As for the content of the Price Management Law, it is to set various official prices based on the market prices in various cities and towns on November 30 of last year. Since the New Year, the Chongqing Municipal Government and the provincial governments of various provinces have separately convened meetings of representatives of various industrial and commercial groups to compile implementation rules. The items under control are generally limited to rice, wheat, salt, oil, cotton yarn, fuel, and paper, and then gradually expanded to others. However, due to different conditions in each province, the official prices are not uniform. (Economic Special News, 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e55">Shanghai to Establish the Central China Damage Insurance Association <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>The Continental News reported on February 15th that the Central China Fire Insurance Association had sent Committee Members Shimizu, Shiji, Wada, and Ando back to Japan to resolve issues related to the reorganization of the association. They have now returned to Shanghai after completing their official duties and are scheduled to hold a reorganization committee meeting at 1:00 PM on the 15th to finalize the reorganization issue. It is reported that the reorganization plan is to integrate the Shanghai Fire Insurance Association and merge all insurance businesses, including fire insurance, marine insurance, and life insurance, to form the Central China Damage Insurance Association, a unified regulatory body. It is said that the approval of the Japanese Ministry of Finance has been obtained on this point, so the reorganization issue is ripe. The inaugural meeting of the reorganization will be held no later than the end of this month. In addition to those with enemy nationality, there are 19 insurance companies operated by third-country nationals, which, together with 25 Japanese companies, will bring the total number of members of the new association to 44. It is reported that the initial task after its establishment will be to standardize insurance premiums.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market situation for Chinese stocks showed a slowdown in the rally, with a shift to consolidation. Stocks that had risen too high saw a decrease in buying interest from both new and old investors, and some profit-taking ideas emerged, temporarily guarding against a pullback. Judging from the uncertain sentiment on all sides, Nanyang Tobacco Company saw buying activity, soaring to over 200 yuan, reaching a high price of 205 yuan, before falling back to 200 yuan, still a gain of 15 yuan. Great China Match also rose 10 yuan to around 410 yuan. Among utility stocks, Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity was dominated by buyers, reaching a new high of 117.5 yuan, up 3 yuan at noon. China Electric Power traded around 80 yuan. In the cultural sector, Commercial Press saw strong buying interest, with sellers holding back, soaring to a high of 750 yuan, a huge gain of 50 yuan. China Bookstore was the most stable, trading between 270 and 280 yuan. The World Book Company also saw strong activity, rising from 142.5 yuan to 152.5 yuan, a gain of 10 yuan. Among department stores, Wing On Company traded at 188 yuan, and Sincere Company at 190 yuan, with slight pullbacks at noon, remaining relatively stable. Sincere Company retreated from 197 yuan to 190 yuan, ending at 193.5 yuan at noon, down just 1 yuan. Innerwear (Sincere) also rose to 25 yuan, before falling back to 23.5 yuan, down 2.5 jiao. Textile stocks saw mixed movements. Wing On Textile Mill initially rose to 455 yuan, before being pushed down to 435 yuan by sellers taking profits, ultimately rising 2.5 yuan. Great Life Mill No. 1 traded at 630 yuan, and Mill No. 3 at 520 yuan, with few sellers. Small-denomination stocks such as New Rich, Xinhua, and Guoguang Printing &amp; Dyeing all remained firm. Friendship Textile and Great China Textile stocks also remained stable. Among new pharmaceutical stocks, Synyi rose again to 312.5 yuan, while Sino-French traded at 37 yuan, before falling back to 35 yuan. New Asia was the most stable, trading between 27.5 and 28 yuan. Minyi had sellers at 67.5 yuan, while Jiufu Pharmaceutical traded at 600 yuan. Financial stocks only rose and did not fall, with China Remittance reaching a high of 225 yuan. Mayling Food soared to 600 yuan. Zhongxing Taiye traded at 12 yuan, with buying interest afterwards. Kang Yuan Can Company, due to the shareholders' meeting last Saturday resolving to issue an official dividend of 3 fen per share, saw its price rise to 51 yuan.</p>
<p>Lianhua Real Estate Co., Ltd. was initiated and organized by the financial community of this city, with Ye Fuxiao as chairman and Tan Gongyuan as general manager. The total capital is 15 million National Currency, divided into 1.5 million shares, with a face value of 10 yuan per share. It obtained the Industry Registration License No. 91 last October. It is reported that the company made considerable profits last year from real estate sales and mortgage lending. Its shares will be officially listed and traded starting today.</p>

<p>Most of the materials at the Wujinpin Zheng Hao store are out of stock, and there is a risk of new materials being cut off. Therefore, the focus of general manufacturers and users has shifted to secondary materials and scrap iron. As a result, scrap iron, which was discarded in the past, now costs 2,000 yuan per ton (Grade A) and 1,500 yuan per ton (Grade B). Old mixed iron is 5,000 yuan per ton. Old hard steel is 12,000 yuan per ton. Old oil pool steel plates are 18,000 yuan per ton. Nail material old shear iron is 6,000 yuan per ton. Short bar and chopstick old shear iron is 8,000 yuan per ton. Small square old shear iron is 10,000 yuan per ton. Old pig iron is 6,700 yuan per ton.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Government Bonds Continue to Rise, with a Slight Pullback <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the government bond market saw an influx of sellers. After reaching new highs, B, C, and E bonds retreated, resulting in all bonds being slightly lower than last week. Although sentiment remains firm, the temporary impact of the crowding of sellers may lead to consolidation. This is a small pullback after three consecutive days of gains. C bonds initially traded at a new high of 7 yuan and 5 jiao, before falling to 5 yuan due to strong selling pressure, ending at 5 yuan and 5 or 6 jiao. B bonds initially traded at a new high of 3 yuan and 5 jiao, before falling to 1 yuan and 4 jiao, ending at around 2 yuan. E bonds initially traded at a new high of 2 yuan and 8 jiao, ending at 2 yuan and 1 jiao. The above three bonds all saw new highs before falling due to selling pressure. A bonds traded at 2 yuan and 8 jiao, and D bonds at 70 yuan. Given the strength of A and D bonds, it is not easy for the market to retreat.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Mixed Movements in Cotton Cloth <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the cotton cloth market was still in a consolidation phase. Opening prices were initially firm, before weakening at noon. Fine cloth saw a slight increase of 2-3 yuan. Four Gentlemen Serge opened at 14 yuan, reaching a high of 14 yuan and 2 jiao, before falling back to 13 yuan and 5 jiao at noon, down 4 jiao from the previous day. Colored cloth Peach Blossom Lin traded at 547 yuan, and Double Fish White Poplin at 13 yuan and 7 jiao 5 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Cigarettes Continue to Rise in Price – Medicines Have Already Fallen <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The cigarette market remains firm, with prices continuing to rise. British Brand traded at 13,750 yuan, Old Knife Brand at 10,800 yuan, Pin Hai Brand at 8,700 yuan, and Five China Brand at 7,400 yuan. Japanese Gold Gun Brand traded at 3,400 yuan, Red Rose at 2,800 yuan, Gold Sky Tower at 4,100 yuan, Quanlu Brand at 4,050 yuan, Nian Zhi at 3,600 yuan, and Compass Brand at 3,400 yuan. National Brand Pyramid traded at 7,800 yuan, Beauty Brand at 7,600 yuan, Gold Mouse Brand at 4,800 yuan, and Golden Dragon at 3,900 yuan, all trending upwards.</p>
<p>The prices of everyday medicines had been trending upwards for days. Yesterday, prices fell, with Bagua Dan trading at 51 yuan, Wan Jin You at 61 yuan, Headache Powder at 50 yuan, Partridge Vegetable at 88 yuan, and Dragon Tiger Ren Dan at 55 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Scarce Buyers of Daily Necessities <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The market for daily necessities has risen rapidly for a week. Yesterday, selling prices, such as matches, fell sharply from their highest price by as much as 800 yuan. The trend for soap remained firm, but there was a lack of interest. The main reason for the rising prices is that the cost of retail alone would have to be sold for the number of 8 yuan, and if you calculate the profit, the user is difficult to buy. The market is therefore quite frozen. A general description of market prices is listed below, Phoenix Brand matches are 5,100 yuan, Beauty Brand are 5,200 yuan, Golden Tripod Brand are 4,300 yuan, Miscellaneous Brands are 3,000 yuan, Guben Soap is 930 yuan, Bai Xiang Mao is 870 yuan, Huang Xiang Mao is 800 yuan, Scissors soap is 920 yuan, White Lees Yang Candle is 570 yuan, and Monk's Hat is 500 yuan.</p>

<p>The Continental News reported on February 14th that the Guangdong Provincial Government, in order to revive the agricultural, industrial, and mining industries in South China, recently formulated a three-year plan for economic revival in Guangdong Province. The first-year plan will involve opening salt fields in Zhongshan County, expanding the Xiling and Kuangjiazhuang coal mines in Huaxian County, and seeking to revive the provincial textile factory. Director Zhang of the Construction Department has gone to Beijing to seek instructions on this matter.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Rambling on Remittances Between Shanghai and Guangdong <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Remittances were originally a business conducted by banks, money shops, or other commercial firms to settle debts between creditors and debtors, saving people from the trouble of transporting cash. Their role in facilitating the prosperity of inter-port trade and facilitating the exchange of public and private funds is significant. At the beginning of the Sino-Japanese Incident, remittances between Shanghai and Guangdong were hampered by the disorder of the monetary system and the varying currency values. Banks and money shops engaged in the remittance business had no basis to rely on. Furthermore, due to traffic disruptions and trade stagnation, the debts incurred by remittances were not easily offset against each other. In addition, government legal restrictions further reduced the scope of operations to a minimum. There was a time when remittances between Shanghai and Guangdong came to a complete standstill, and trade between the two ports was equivalent to zero. The situation only began to improve after the currency system was reformed. Because the currency in Guangdong was also mainly Central Reserve Notes, and the cargo transport between the two ports became more frequent with the progress of the situation, remittances between Shanghai and Guangdong, based on the needs of commercial activities, flourished again, restoring the exchange rate to parity. However, after the Central Reserve Bank restricted remittances a month ago, the exchange rate between Shanghai and Guangdong changed. Due to the factual difficulties, general merchants could not remit 2,000 every day, so they sought out money shops at high prices. Recently, the black market exchange rate has reached an unprecedented high of 2,500 yuan per 10,000 yuan. As a result, Chinese medicines and groceries shipped from northern Guangdong have become more expensive. (Wei Shi)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Investment Channels in This City Have Become Simplified <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (15th), The Times reported that the Shanghai investment market has been active for the past few weeks. The reason for this is not difficult to study. At present, there is only one way out for those who have floating capital in Shanghai, that is, to invest in stocks or stock-like investments. This trend is due to the fact that Japan's Greater East Asia Ministry has recently clearly stated that the prices of goods in China are higher than those in Japan, and has now taken steps to adjust them to reduce prices in China. Even before this method of restricting prices has been put into practice, it is already impossible to invest in hoarding goods, because the channels for hoarding goods have been officially blocked. The largest hoarding of goods is cotton yarn. Shanghai alone currently has 700,000 bales of cotton yarn, but each bale is registered and cannot be moved in any way. The second is rice, but rice is controlled by the government and cannot be bought or sold privately. The next is coal. Coal, in addition to its practical use, is not allowed to have any other function. As for other goods (items other than the main ones), even if someone wants to hoard them, they feel that they are prone to unexpected losses due to lack of experience, so they hesitate. As a result, the owners of large and small floating capital in Shanghai currently believe that the simplest and most reliable investment channel is the stock market or a market equivalent to the stock market. Real estate investment is indeed promising, but a huge amount of capital is required to talk about real estate investment. Therefore, although real estate prices in Shanghai have increased recently, the stock prices of real estate companies that operate real estate have increased even more. From this, we can see that investment channels in Shanghai have become simplified, that is, they are all trending towards the stock market.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Statistics on Chinese-Owned Insurance Companies <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Ximing</p>
<p>Insurance companies, once rising like the wind and clouds and enjoying a period of great prosperity, are now restricted by the authorities and no longer registered after December 18th of last year. Up to recently, including existing companies and those not yet opened, there were a total of ninety-six. The largest capital amount was five million, with two companies; one company with two and a half million; and three companies with two million. Those with capital as low as several tens of thousands or even ten thousand were in the majority. But with such scarce capital, and the insured amount easily exceeding their assets at times, wouldn't it be very dangerous? Originally, they all had mutual reinsurance within the industry. For example, if a certain policyholder had an amount of one hundred thousand, they would have to find other companies to reinsure it. And the reinsurance amount also has a certain proportion. It often happens that after receiving a large sum, some in the industry might politely refuse due to the excessive risk of the business. Therefore, outsiders who don't understand the inside story believe that the insurance industry specializes in soliciting business: little do they know that there are also difficult situations at times?</p>
<p>Given the size of Shanghai and the prosperity of industry and commerce, the insurance industry should have its own considerably active territory. Therefore, before the war, half of the industry was controlled by foreign merchants. At that time, American insurance businesses accounted for ninety percent, totaling more than one hundred and thirty companies. At that time, there were only a few Chinese-owned companies, such as Taiping, Wing On, Sincere, Ning Shao, and others. And most of what they insured were small policyholders. Even in June of last year, there were only about twenty Chinese-owned insurance companies. After autumn, they started opening one after another, and now there are eighty-eight that have already opened. The following statistics are for those that have already opened. There are still eight in the preparatory stage, so the names are not listed. After the restrictions, perhaps there will be no more increases.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Starting from Learning English <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Dong</p>
<p>For nearly a hundred years, marine transportation, on the one hand for trade and on the other hand to absorb new knowledge from various countries around the world, has made learning foreign languages a temporary trend among our people. And the most dominant foreign language is English.</p>
<p>The busiest places for Chinese people to learn English are churches and church schools. Those who learn English naturally try their best to speak English when they meet British and American people; even when they meet Chinese compatriots, they also speak English, at least mixing in a few English words. From a learning psychology perspective, this kind of repeated practice is effective. However, in terms of the motives of many people learning English, their intentions are contemptible. One type is to act fashionable and show off their ability; another type is to use English to earn a living and make a fortune under the British and Americans.</p>
<p>Of course, when British and American power was at its peak in China, we saw English signs everywhere, as well as countless Sino-English hybrid things, and we could hear extremely fluent English everywhere, as well as the awkward "pidgin" English. In post offices, customs, train stations, salt administrations, and especially in foreign firms, we could encounter many "high-class Chinese" in Western suits and leather shoes. If Chinese compatriots in traditional clothing went to ask them about official matters, they often gave them a cold shoulder or "looked to the left and right and spoke of other things." If Western-dressed compatriots went to ask them about something, they would still offer a few perfunctory words. If British and Americans came to ask them about something, they immediately "bowed deeply" and "smiled obsequiously," being courteous to the extreme. Most of the British and Americans who came to China had not received much good education, and their purpose in coming to China was to make a fortune; after arriving in China, they bossed the Chinese around; and the compatriots who learned English only knew how to flatter the British and Americans, or even lost their minds and carried out their orders, resulting in even more unbearable situations.</p>
<p>In terms of cultural communication, learning foreign languages should not only not be suppressed but should also be encouraged; but if it is used for speculation and as a shortcut to "making a foreign fortune," the drawbacks are endless.</p>
<p>We hope that general parents and education administrators pay special attention to a passage from Yan Zhitui of the Northern Qi Dynasty in "Yan's Family Instructions":</p>
<p>"A scholar-official of the Qi Dynasty once said to me: 'I have a son, seventeen years old, who knows a little about the classics. I am teaching him the Xianbei language and playing the pipa, and he is beginning to understand them. With this, he can serve the dukes and ministers and will undoubtedly be favored, which is also important.' I bowed my head and did not answer. How strange is this person's way of teaching his son! Even if he could achieve high office through this, I would not want you to do it.'"</p>
<p>If this passage from Yan's words could be accepted by our people as family instruction, then China's future should have a new look!</p>
<h3 id="e69">Spicy and Bitter Feelings <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Ziying</p>
<p>Due to my job, I got to know several friendly foreign friends. Yesterday, I was entrusted by another local friend to translate an official document for him. I originally wanted to do it myself, but thinking that the friendly foreign friend was on the third floor of the same office as me, close at hand, so I took this troublesome task up there to trouble him. He kindly put aside his own official business to help me, prioritizing it. He listened to me while writing quickly, and aside from some minor questions due to language barriers (because my Japanese is not very fluent), there were no "head-scratching" kind of "interruptions." After I finished speaking, his document was also written, and looking at it, it was very tactful, very concise, and exactly what I wanted. Considering that this friend's academic ability and status are not considered high, but he has such literary cultivation, it is naturally admirable, but he also gave me a feeling that was spicy and bitter.</p>
<p>I feel that the cultural level of our current national people has really declined to an untenable position, and yet we are burdened with the mission of communicating culture, which is both shameful and frightening. Try comparing the national education and national life of friendly foreign countries with our own, and it is enough to make anyone with a conscience feel chilled and alarmed.</p>
<p>Japanese national schools (there are many in Shanghai and Nanjing) are known at a glance for their magnificent buildings, complete equipment, neat student clothing, and serious demeanor as a kind of education that is on the right track. The content is very serious; first, the selection of teachers.</p>
<h3 id="e70">First Place in the January Essay Contest: My Life—Hospital Attendant (Part 2) <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Qing</p>
<p>In late autumn, I was transferred to work in the ward. I carried each groaning internal medicine patient and wailing surgical patient from the clinic to the bed, serving them day after day, watching them gradually recover, watching them walk out of the hospital. Especially those pediatric patients, when they entered the hospital, their haggard little faces were really pitiful, but after a few days, they were sunbathing in the garden, and after a few more days, they were holding their father's hand or leaning on their mother's shoulder, their apple-like faces floating with innocent smiles, and they left the hospital full of vigor. That was the most exciting thing, and I could offset any hard work with it.</p>
<p>I was very interested in the work in the surgery room. I never dreamed that I would have such an opportunity. I saw the patient's lungs and stomach, I saw the heart beating, saw the doctors cutting off rib after rib, saw the pus drawn from the abdominal cavity of patients with peritonitis, saw how the small intestine would swell and the cecum expand, and cutting off an entire kidney and intestinal surgery were commonplace. Although sometimes I couldn't finish my work until late at night, I still felt that the three months passed too quickly.</p>
<p>The work in the laboratory was also quite interesting. In less than three days of starting work, I could already distinguish between white blood cells and red blood cells under the microscope. The development of science made the ugly bacteria unable to hide in the slightest. This great knowledge made me work even harder. Unexpectedly, I won the favor of the old and kind laboratory technician. He noted 95 points on the performance appraisal form, and I received an extra 50 yuan in cash bonus. To this day, I yearn to dissect rabbits to confirm early pregnancy tests. No matter how heavy the sedimentation device was, making my arms ache from shaking, no matter how smelly and dirty the urine, feces, phlegm, and blood were, I naturally mixed with them all day long. In short, the laboratory is worth missing.</p>
<p>During the three months that I worked in the pharmacy, I became familiar with 1,300 kinds of drugs, thanks to the enthusiasm of the three pharmacists. I copied the instructions for 110 kinds of prepared medicines.</p>
<p>On New Year's Day evening, I reviewed my past life and boldly wrote these few words in my diary:</p>
<p>"Who says society is cold? If society is really cold, then we should be a blast furnace, baking with fiery passion to warm society."</p>
<p>Eighteen months have passed leisurely, and I feel supremely happy. I hope to achieve even greater success with the arrival of the New Year. I understand who has given this to me, and I pray silently. I am grateful for this great grace, and I am willing to dedicate my strength to the public. I firmly remember, remember Principal Wang's farewell message, "Be mindful everywhere, everything is learning." Their academic qualifications and abilities are thoroughly and effectively reviewed, and once someone becomes a teacher, they can also receive spiritual and material protection from the country, society, and the people, and coupled with the encouragement of their own patriotic ideology, in their minds there are only the four words "education is sacred." Second, the teaching of lessons also emphasizes practicality and has little pretense, and it pays special attention to science. Therefore, there are many talented people and few pseudo-talented or non-talented people who are neither a donkey nor a horse. Looking back at our country's education, school buildings, equipment, and uniforms are naturally out of the question, and the students' manners and etiquette are also embarrassing to look at in comparison. The former is material, so you can't just talk about it, but the latter is a spiritual issue, where is the spirit of education! Speaking of the main shortcomings in content, it is the selection of teachers, the review is careless, and the country and society cannot help them, and the teachers themselves endure unexpected suffering.</p>
<p>We know that Japanese national life has several characteristics: First, life is serious. All corrupt activities, such as opium dens and gambling dens, are not allowed to be involved in, and according to another Japanese youth, Japanese people under the age of twenty are not allowed to smoke or drink alcohol according to the law. As for the simplicity, diligence, and frugality of life, etc., these are all well-known facts. Second, emphasis is placed on the group. They call their own people "fellow countrymen." As long as it is for the public good of fellow countrymen, whether it is education, support, or health, they will go all out with the greatest spirit of sacrifice. Third, they are full of a spirit of research. This is a recent matter. I personally saw a Japanese amateur scientist, in a small room, concentrating on research. It is said that he spent three full days analyzing a scientific principle, and finally found a new path outside of books. I dare not say that every Japanese person has such a strong desire to improve, but on the whole, this is indeed their advantage; I also dare not say that there are no such progressive figures among Chinese people, but they are very few in number. On the other hand, our national life also has several characteristics: First, the trend of recreation is particularly prevalent in society. Whenever you meet someone, you ask them, what do you do for recreation? They start with movies and dramas, and end with bamboo grove elegance, and what is especially eye-catching and heartbreaking is: lying on couches, inhaling clouds and spitting out mist; second, there is a lack of a sense of community. Just look at real society, how many people are enthusiastic about public welfare? How many are watching the fire from across the bank? How many are using the beautiful name of public welfare to enrich their private pockets? If it is said that a lack of civic virtue is the "fatal wound" of Chinese people, then this "wound" is still currently "fatal"! Third, there is a lack of ordinary ambition. I cannot deny the good phenomenon of a few ambitious people groping alone in the dark, but unfortunately there are too few. In reality, they are traitors who violate the tense spirit of the times, and in the future, they are the criminals who will ruin the next generation of China—I can't bear to say this, but I have to say it, because this is the truth.</p>
<p>In addition, whether viewed from politics, industry, or social sciences, there are similar feelings. This inherently has its complex background and cannot be easily changed at once. But those who are nationals should never let their will fall into a state of numbness.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Emotion and Reason <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Lin</p>
<p>After reading "We Need Enthusiasm," I couldn't help but think about the relationship between emotion and reason in life.</p>
<p>Humans are complex organisms. Throughout their lives, people cannot be without reason when judging things, and they cannot lack emotion. Being too biased towards reason becomes cold and ruthless, and being biased towards emotion becomes inappropriate and loses the dignity of "human."</p>
<p>Those who only rely on reason in everything must be unsentimental. They will never receive the warmth of family, the value of friendship, or the joy of the community. They cannot distinguish between spring and winter. Those who live with them always feel like they are separated by a layer of ice wall. To give a practical example, wasn't the patricide case that shook Shanghai a few years ago the result of a cold, somber, and devoid of emotion in the family?</p>
<p>It is also unacceptable to rely solely on emotion in everything. Emotion can only maintain a certain level and must not be allowed to flood. Inconstancy of mood, crying and laughing excessively, should not exist. People who are too emotional are touched by everything: the moon! Separation and death! Illusory images in a mirror or moon! Life is like a dream! These feelings often deprive people of their ambition and end their lives in melancholy. This is extremely undesirable!</p>
<p>Therefore, while we need enthusiasm, we also need reason. The two go hand in hand and are indispensable.</p>
<p>In our careers, we should use reason to solve problems, have a serious heart to work, and use pure thoughts to overcome obstacles. We must never distort reason to do improper things. In this way, others will naturally respect your decisiveness and perseverance, and raise your dignity.</p>
<p>In human relations and family matters, there should be a little emotion, and the warmth of the family should be maintained. It can quietly heal all your wounds. I remember a famous saying: "Great people are created by harmonious and happy families." We should have warmth, concern, and sympathy for those who live together, because your happiness is created at the same time.</p>
<p>Therefore, emotion and reason should have equal weight in our lives. While shouting loudly "We need enthusiasm," it is also natural that "We need reason"!</p>

<p>— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>He was also telling new jokes—about officer training corps, the ration system, and the various windows that had to be fitted with anti-aircraft shutters. Every Monday, a mysterious hash food began to appear on the school menu, which Chips called "Abhorrendum." The story spread—have you heard Chips' latest joke?</p>
<p>In the winter of 1917, Chatteris fell ill, and Chips, for the second time in his life, became acting headmaster of Brookfield. In April, Chatteris died, and the governors asked Chips to continue acting until the end of his term." He said he could, but they couldn't officially appoint him. This final honor was finally within his reach, and he intuitively shrank back. He felt that he was not worthy in many respects. He said to Rivers. "You see, I am not a young man, and I don't want people——to expect too much of me. I am like the new colonels—majors—that you see everywhere—mere wartime flukes. An old regular—that is all I am really."</p>
<p>1917. 1918. Chips lived through these times. Every morning he sat in the headmaster's study, dealing with all sorts of problems, coping with all sorts of complaints and requests. From that vast experience came a kind of kindness, gentleness, and self-confidence. Always keeping a sense of proportion, that was the main thing.

<h3 id="e76">Anti-British and American Association Ends Scholarship <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The   Anti-British and American   Association's   scholarship,   qualified, totaling one hundred and forty-two people, the highest scholarship amount is 350 yuan for the university group, 250 yuan for the high school group, and 200 yuan for the junior high school group. Those who are not admitted will each receive 20 yuan for book expenses as a token of encouragement. Since the announcement on the 12th of this month, the admitted students have come one after another to receive the funds. Mr. Zhang Yipeng personally encouraged them to clarify the purpose of the scholarship. The   meeting is scheduled to end on the 16th of the month. It is hoped that those who have not received the funds will go to receive the funds and retrieve their certificates within office hours on that day. Those who fail to do so will be considered to have voluntarily given up, and the scholarship that the student is entitled to will be transferred to a reserve student for replacement. It is hoped that those who have not completed the procedures will go to complete them as soon as possible. Do not delay yourself.</p>
