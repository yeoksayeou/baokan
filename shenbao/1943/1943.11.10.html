<p>社評</p>
<h3>冬賑時機已迫</h3>
<p>前幾天雨絲迷濛，西風轉緊，氣溫直下，已有瑟縮景象了。俗俚有云：「九月廿七催爛污，十月五風躲不過」。意思是說九月底時序初冬，九月廿七邊常是有風的季節，道風的吹，是催促人們及時準備塞衣，特別指出「拆爛污」的人們，或者忘了添備寒衣，或者尚在長生庫裏，所以說「催爛污」。「十月五風」，就是說十月初五的西風，凜冽刮肌，沒有寒衣是「躲不過」了。這些日期是指農曆，現在已經超過了。不過，今年總算遲寒，到現在還穿夾衣。然而氣候突轉是很可能的，為免得凍病，自以早些準備為是。</p>
<p>當然，自己有力量為自己準備寒衣的人們，應該早些準備。但是，自已沒有力量為自己準備寒衣的人們怎樣呢？孟子云：「惻隱之心，人皆有之」，我們自然不忍見他們的埃凍，應該由社會以大眾的力量替他們準備。目前時季已到，就是社會為之準備—作已經到了迫切的時候。我們曾在十月二十一日及本月四日的社評中兩次提出準備冬賑的問題，也就是這個意思。</p>
<p>社會福利部主管的中央與上海社會福利經費籌募委員會最近成立，並於本月三日舉行聯席曾議，決定統一籌辦三十二年廣冬賑經費霧募事宜。冬賑的一部份工作，就是為一般自己沒有力量替自己準備寒衣的人們，解決困難。因此，對於籌款方面如何設計，如何進行，如何保管，都應該從速計劃，提早實現。</p>
<p>我們檢閱該會關於冬賑的議決案中，包括：　另設冬賑經費籌慕委員會，專負其責。　籌募標的額定一千萬元。　募款期限自十一月十六日起至十二月底止。就這三點分析，第一，設置委員會，以專責任，當然有其必要，我們希望後速成立，規距規定開始籌款日期已近，尤須尅日成立，因為討論籌募辦法，不是忽促可以周密的。第二，籌款目標為一千萬元，這筆數目，就目前社會經濟能力以言，可以負擔的，雖然社會上公私慈善事業的捐款頻繁，不免使捐款者超趄不前，但冬賑範國普遍，如籌募得當，集數並非難事。第三，籌款日期雖假定至年底，但我們認為籌募方法得當，施賑辦法切實，不難取得社會各界的信任，踴躍輸捐，則提早籌足數額，也是極可能的事。</p>
<p>此外，對於募款方面，我們列舉幾個困難的實例，並略申微見，以供參考：</p>
<p>昨天新聞報社會服務攔發表「裁製寒衣預算發生困難」的報吿，以十月二十六日計劃的五十萬元製衣四千件之預算，現在事實上已不可能。第一是工料渦高，五十萬元僅能製衣一千餘件，尚難保後此之益為困難。第二是捐款不能如預期之踴躍，半個月時問，僅達預擬目標十分之一強。因此，祇能「就事實辦事而已」。道一種事實上的困難，為冬賑籌款與施賑的最好參考，希望將來主持者特別注意。</p>
<p>上海市貧病救濟協會去春成立，該會之組織人選設計各方面，在客觀上頗為　想。但年餘之中，籌得捐款為數不多，這其原因何在，值得在捐款時研究改進之</p>
<p>娛樂塲所的座上客，總是　濟環境轎優的，目前水市劇塲舞塲的盛況，更為有力的說明，我們建議從娛樂塲所的票價上附捐五成，以充冬賑經費，成續定必不惡，此在消費者多化若干，為慈善事衆所用，取之實不為虐。英館宴會每席在千竟以上者也可附捐五成，在主人的經濟力量，諒無問題。</p>
<p>西風已起，嚴寒瞬至，冬賑準備，時機已迫！願主其專者後速推動，社會各界竭力贊助，俾流離雜胞，早減凍餒之苦！</p>

<h3>汪院長等返首都　昨發表重要談話　闡明大東亞會議三個特點</h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電　宣傳部於十一月九日下午六時，發表公報如下，我國出席大東亞會議代表，江行政院長，於本月一日，僭同周副院長佛海，褚外交部長民誼，軍事委員會陳委員昌祖，行政院周秘書長隆庠，薛副秘書長逢元赴日，茲以住務完畢，於本日下午五時三十分，返抵南京。周副院長因接洽經濟財政各事未畢，領稍遲數日始能言旋。</p>
<p>南京九日中央社電　以團結東亞十億民衆為主旨之大束亞會蟻，於五日在東京隆重揭幕。此次大東亞會議中，關於完遂大東亞戰爭，及建設大東亞方針，因各國代表開誠協議，全體一致通過大東亞共同宣言，至六日始圓滿閉幕。我國出席代表汪行政院長，及列席者禇外交部長，行政院周秘書長，年委會陳委員行政院薛副秘書長等一行，已於九日由日本福　乘機返國，於當日下午五時三十分安抵首都。各機關長官赴機塲迎迓者，到有鮑文越，陳君懸，陳春圃，吳凱聲，陳之碩，周學昌，陳允文，李驅一，申振網，鹽邦方面到有谷大使，松井總參謀長，榮山中將等數十人。汪院長御常禮服，神采奕奕，下機後，與谷大使等歡迎人員握手致謝，旋即乘車逕返官邸。</p>
<p>汪院長談話</p>
<p>南京九日中央社電　我國出席大東亞會蟻代表汪行政院畏，已於九日安返首都，並發表談話如下。。此次大東亞會議，與麽史上所有國際會議，其不同之點有三，第一，歷史上有名的國際會議，如拿破崙戰後之維也納會議，上次歐戰後之巴黎會議，不過強者對於弱者之處分，共會蟻之目的，柱強者如何分　，弱者如何供人魚肉而已，大東亞會議反之，純為強者對於弱者之扶助，前者為功利見解，後者為道義精神，絕對相反。第二，美國的門羅主義，所謂美洲人之美洲者，乃墓於人種的偏見，排斥他人種，不使得存在於美洲之內。大東亞會議反之，所謂亞洲人之亞洲者，乃亞洲人對於英美之壓迫，而求解放，解放之後，資源開發，文化交流，與世界共之，眞乃天下為公，絕無自私之必。第三，最近英美等國屢屢舉行會議，其目的不外兩種　甲為英國企圖如何保持共已得之殖民地，壓制殖民地之人民，不使得獨立自由。乙為美國本身已擁有世界上嬰富之資源，　以為未足，企圖如何壟斷一切，使整個世界都成為其殖民地。此兩國老，在其本身利益觀點上絕對衝突，而在殘害他人種，壓制他民族的觀點上，則不得不夥同作惡。大東亞會議反之，各民族為其生有獨立而奮門，所企園者，在囘復其被掠奪之利益，而非掠奪他人之利益，此為革命精神，而非侵略行徑。綜些三特點，大東亞會議確為　時代的國際會議，吾人於此，不能不欽佩盟邦日本倡導之功德，而對於泰滿非緬諸友邦，及自由印度臨時政府之協力，亦不能不表甚深之敬意“吾人今後惟有遵照國父遺囑，聯合世界上以平等待我之民族共同奮鬥。同時深望重魔方面丞加反省，將幡然來歸，共為東亞之同志乎？抑一誤再誤，受英美之指使，剚刃於獨立前芽之緬甸猶以為未足，且將逞其毒於自由印度為東亞之叛逆，貽中國歷史上未曾有之污蹟乎？是在重慶方面之自擇矣。</p>
<h3>日軍　佔領梅溪寺</h3>
<p>華中前綫九日中央社電　向煖水街方面迅速一進擊之日軍，於七日拂時佔領渝暫編第大師據守之梅溪寺，發見該地北方有數十　渝軍兵營。可收容一師以上之兵力，當即將其佔領，鹵獲軍械彈藥資材甚多。</p>
<p>華中前綫九日中央社電　猛攻洞庭湖西岸之日軍，大日下午一時三十分，佔領安鄉，渝軍第四十四軍第百六十二師蒙受重創。日軍並爾獲大量兵器彈藥資材等。據渝軍俘虜稱，渝第百六十二師飾長孫文照，於日軍發動猛擊之際，即棄部下渡過大平運河，倉皇向西方臨　方面游走。渝軍抗戰意識消失漢口九日中央社電洞庭湖西日軍新作戰，現正猛烈展開中。綜合此間所接消息，在此次作戰中，中國方面各機關及民衆，亦皆一致協力，且均十分熱烈，此足以證明中國間盟條約在一般民衆間，已發生極大影響。現接近戰區民衆，均紛紛遷一至和平區內，其避往內地者，絕無僅右。據最近避難來此者談，洞庭湖西渝軍，對於中日締結同盟條約，雖　未完全明瞭，值中日關係之右釗期進展，彼等亦已有所聞知。故目下對於渝方之抗戰命令，即在師旅長開，亦有陽奉陰　之概，抗戰意　，已一蹶不振。至一般民衆，除避往和平地區外，絕不再作抗戰之想。尤其聞悉大束亞宣言後，其復興中國之思想，顯巳輿國府所主張者趨於一致。且因美空軍在淪方各地大失民心，內地民衆一致希望渝當局立刻停止抗戰，以保留中國元氣，預料此次洞庭湖西作戰，對於渝方，尤其所部抗戰意識，定有極大打擊。</p>

<p>南京九日中央社電　我國海軍當局，為考察日本海軍狀況，特於上月組織日本海軍考擦團，赴日本考察。茲悉該團一行，海軍部次長招　章，中央海眾學校校長姜西國，水路測量局長葉可松，海軍部軍衡司長鄭世璋，軍樞司長曹南田，廣州要港部參謀長李雲　，威海衛要港部參謀長孟鐵樵，南京要港部參謀長陳瑞其，海軍部軍需科長梁大治等，業已於日昨返國抵京，該團代表一行，並特於九日下午一時，柱國際俱樂部接見中日新聞記者，發表此行感想，茲誌各代表縷話大意如次。。</p>
<p>（招桂章中將）本團於上月赴日，已於日昨　京，歷時約二十餘日，此次赴日考察，最主要之目標，即為。。海軍教育訓練，　軍需生產狀況，魯軍民努力情形。關於日本之海軍訓練技術，純熟達於極點，即於黑夜中，其技術人員工作亦如平日，可見其熱練之一般。軍需生產亦足使吾人驚嘆，其機器新銳偉大，與夫造船裂砲之迅速，實非他國所及。而一般軍需工廠之生一產量，不但不因戰爭而減一少，且數倍於平日。</p>
<p>（姜西園中將中央海軍學校校長）本人此次赴日視察，一般觀感所得，約有三點　　精神方面，日本國民均有一種特有情一神，即為對神的信仰，與對天皇的敬愛。故太平洋戰爭，日軍多能視死如歸，以爭取勝利，而後方民衆之刻苦耐勞，共間向完遂大東亞戰爭之途邁進。　物資方面，各處囤積之資源均異常衆多，其飛機艦船之製造，直易於縫衣製　，人力資源亦異常雄厚，現正猛烈訓練大批戰士。　社會一般狀況，大東亞戰爭日本國民均能泰然處之，只理頭工作，決無驚慌反常狀態。人民所需之物資，均能以配　辦法，合理得到，一方面忍耐，一方面準備造成必勝情勢，國民所體念者，為大束亞戰爭如何可以致勝，所需要者，即為勝利而已。</p>
<p>（葉可松少將），日本之水路部實為世界最優秀者，因是歷年以來。我國之水路測量編纂，即係採取日本制度。但十幾年後之今日，日本之水路部又較前擴充五倍至六倍，其技術如航空氣象等，奠不較十八年前有極顯著之進步。</p>
<p>（鄭世璋少將），　人此次隨視察團赴日觀盛，即日本之機械進步，各種步門組織完密，機構健全，設備應有盡有，較之世界任何強國，並無遜色。此不能不欽佩鹽邦日本近卞數年來努力研討，而獲得非常進步之結果，並可為吾人　借　。盟邦海軍捷報頻傳南京九日中央社電鹽邦海年此次在摩諾屬，及玻根維爾島方面海面，與美艦隊激戰，擊沉毀敵艦船甚多，並擊落敵機二百餘架，此種赫赫戰果，業經日大本營連日發表。記者頃特　訪甫由日本考察海軍歸來之海軍部次長招桂章氏，叩詢對此次海戰之感想。承發表如下：大東亞戰爭發生以來，盟邦英勇將士奮戰於太平洋方面，巳摧毀敵方之實力，確立不敗之態勢。今又於摩諾島及玻根　爾島方面，予敵艦隊重大　擊，使頑敵伺機反攻之企圖，歸於幻滅。吾人於此除對盟邦英勇將士，致無上之敬佩外，愈感大東亞戰爭勝利之獲得更指日可待，而益堅完遂大東亞光榮建設之信念。</p>
<h3>中日盟約成立　北京的興奮</h3>
<p>北京通訊</p>
<p>三十下午四時左右，記者正在一個朋友家中閒談，朋友的少爺外出歸來，用急促的口氣，報吿說：「剛才有號外在街上售賢，因為賣報的人跑得太快，沒右買到，不知是什麼事　。</p>
<p>好久了，在北京沒有見到號外。這幾天正是東京臨時會議開會的時期，而莫斯科會議也正在進行。大家得到悄息後，就大加作沒有根據的推測，一方面就派人到外面去買號外。有的人認為這和近日南北一元化的謠言有關，有的人甚至認為和世界和平有關，辯說了半天，毫無結果。人從門外經過說是　。「全面和平實現了，重慶有廣播　。正欲追問，其人已疾行而去。這一句話卻激動了大家的情緒，有的朋友居然高歌歡　起來，說：「明天星期，大家應當大大的慶祝一下」。</p>
<p>辯論了一會，買號外的人回來了，帶了一張實報的號外，大家一讀，才知道是中日同盟條約在南簽定的消息。雖然不是全面的和平，但因為這和全面和平亦有關係，大家就認為總算是踏上全面和平之路，也覺得十分高興。</p>
<p>這消息出來的第二天，滿街高懸國旗，而報紙上也載有管翼　情報局長在全聯大會上發表這項消息時全體會員鼓掌歡呼的消息，當局還命令全華北懸旗三日，以示慶祝，廣播協會也為此而放送特別節目，北海中央兩個公問也開放子三天。可知這消息是給北京的市民多大的興奮。</p>
<p>這兩天碰到朋友，沒有一個人不談到這問題的。樂覩一點的就手舞足蹈的認為中國前途大有希望，悲觀成性的人，神經敏捷的人統以為跟着中日間盟絛約的簽定，南北一元化恐怕只是時間的問題，而南北幣制的更勸也統拈了他腦筋中的重要地位。總而言之，得到中日同鹽的消息後。北京的市民確是大大的興奮了。（北燕十一月一日航寄）</p>

<h3>國府昨舉行　參戰紀念會</h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電　國府于本月九日上午十時，在國府大禮堂舉行參戰紀念會。文官參軍兩處職員，一律齊集禮堂參加，由典禮局陳局長　主席。領導行　後，宣讀參戰布吿，並肅立為前綫將士戰爭勝利致敬，為喪病將一士康復致祝，為陣亡將士致悼。並由陳局長報吿，我國參加大東亞戰爭意義，至十一時許禮成散會。</p>
<h3>張總理談話</h3>
<p>新京九日中央社電　滿洲國張國務總理頃發表談話，大意如次：日本國民民氣，極為　昂，於此決戰期中，刻正上下一體，一致團結，向完成聖戰邁進。余目覩此種情形，實不勝感激，此次大東亞會議中各國代表開誠交換意見，協議結果，乃對世界關明共同宣言，此可謂為建設大東亞之大憲章　相信此次會蟻不僅為東亞空前具有歷史性之會議，且并為世界歷史劃一新紀元。余參加會議，曾與東亞各指導者分別促膝懇談，彼等無不熱誠勞力，令人衷心敬佩，故我人對大東亞戰爭必勝，大東亞建設必成之信念，亦更形堅固，而深感所負賣任電大，余甚望國民諸君結成一團，更以堅強決意努力完成戰爭，逢成建設大東亞之目的。</p>
<h3>菲總統洛勒爾　對世界廣播</h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電　菲律寶總統洛勒爾，八日下午四時半於東京廣播電臺對全世界廣播，閘明亞洲民族協力完成戰爭之決意。</p>
<h3>基輔前綫展開　烈攻防戰　克里米亞局勢無變化</h3>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　海通社訊：上週杪蘇軍攻勢之重心更韓移至基輔區，敵軍佔領該城後，即欲擴大其戰果，向西北之柯洛斯坦實施進攻，企圖自側翼威脅普列伯河與聶伯河會合處之德軍陣地，並向南面與東南推進，企圖突入大聶伯河灣德軍之後方。基軸戰役德軍採取彈性防禦戰術，使蘇軍不得不屢調增援加人作戰，故其戰果對於其他方面，尤其是大聶伯河潛戰局發展當有影響。德軍向克里伏洛格迤北與尼柯波爾進南作局部推進，已獲改善所守陣地，並殲減敵之突擊兵一隊。敵在聶伯河下游克森方面增　壓力，克里米亞戰局上週杪無重大變化，蘇軍雖獲局部突破，但迄未渡過貝萊柯浦地峽，打通前往北克里米亞之路。蘇軍在寇許橋頭僅有小規模進攻，但右增援自海上課來。</p>
<h3>白宮召開　軍事會議</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城九日中央社電　據華盛頓　。羅斯福總統，昨日著急海陸軍首腦至白宮舉行臨時會議，陸軍參謀長馬歇爾將軍。海軍總司令金上將。及美空軍司令安諾德均出席。</p>
<h3>英土會談結束　發表聯合公報　土耳其不致放棄中立</h3>
<p>斯丹埠九日中央社電　據開羅電：英外相艾　此次在開羅與土耳其外長受奈門卓格魯會談，至八日上午就會談結果發表公報如次。。土耳其外長曼奈門卓格魯於本月五日六日爾日在開羅會見英外相艾登，就莫斯科會談之結果以及全面之情勢交換意見，外長之會談係基於爾國友好與同盟之精神而舉行。</p>
<p>瑞典京城九日中央社電　英外相艾登及土外長之正式談判雖告結束，但據開羅英官方之消息，更有一臨別之脅談曾經舉行。關於瓦相問之利益問題衆僧會右討論。</p>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　海通社外交防員稱。此間獲悉英外相艾登在開羅會談時，必曾向土外長雄設士耳其應以某某數處根據地供英空軍使用。土政府今所發表之談話，顯已拒絕此項建議，并重申繼續嚴守中立之意。土耳其對開羅會談所作之評論。亦皆謂其主要目的乃柱探取關於莫斯科會議內容之情報。要知倘士耳其放棄其中立政策并以根據地讓予英國，則蘇聯亦可援例而取得利益。</p>
<h3>義南部山區　大戰進行中　德利用刺蝟陣地抵抗</h3>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　據海通社訊：英美軍於抵達卡里格里亞諾何口　維納弗洛　伊塞尼亞　伐斯杜一綫後，欲繼續推進，已因損失過重而被阻。德軍在全綫加強抵抗，且有在維納弗洛區發動反攻，將美軍逐出自奧里維托與文杜拉問初次進攻所佔之山頭。現戰綫情形大致如下：蓋塔灣沿海美第五軍左翼欲圖渡河，但未能在北岸建立強力之橋頭堡鋒阻於米格那諾，尚未抵卡里格里亞諾河。維納弗洛以西及西悲，乃美軍右翼主力所在地，美軍於增援後，於星期日再向德軍所佔地僅供，其人數及戰具之衆，為義大利戰場所未見，邀戰進行未已。</p>
<p>瑞典京城九日中央社電　據倫敦悉，倫敦反軸心軍司令部之加拿大靑報官皮密西宣稱：反軸心軍在南義作戰所獲之每一寸土地，均付有極大之代價，因反軸心軍現已被迫改取新戰略，以　抗德軍之彈性戰略也。皮氏又謂，德軍利用刺蝟陣地，每一重要據點交叉路口及山丘被改變為刺蝟陣地，致大規模戰事進行極感困難</p>
<h3>國社黨革命紀念　希特勒演說</h3>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　德元首希特勒於國社黨廿周年紀念，在慕尼黑召集空軍部長戈林。宣傳部長郭培爾。內長希姆萊。勞動戰綫司令萊義。突擊隊長修普曼。及其他國社黨領袖，訓話一小時，要旨如次：當此間志崛起紀念日，余預定於慕尼黑滯留數小時，俾與諸同志相會，這憶往昔及說明未來之方針。</p>
<p>追溯往事認淸敵人</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰德國因後方發生叛變致遭慘敗，常時威瑪爾共和國（德國國內之一小國）雖為民主主義政體，其初會因民主主義國家之重壓而倍　危亡之苦，實則威瑪爾共和國不能阻止止共產主義之勝利，固屬必然，蓋除國家社會主義之德國國民外，實無能打倒共產主義之時利者也。余曾聞有講與共產主義立於親善關係而能避免其產主義之威脅者，此不啻與雛雉與家鴨敢肅對校狐說明「吾等決不攻擊閣下，」而期狡狐轉為素食主義者相同。其產主義之為物其於未倒仆之前，決無停止攻擊之時。愛沙尼亞人與立　宛人果曾企圖征服烏拉爾乎，羅馬居亞人會覬覦蘇聯之煤油乎，芬蘭會攻擊蘇聯乎：均非也，然蘇聯則攻擊芬蘭，使愛沙尼亞人立陶宛人遷去烏拉爾，甚且企圖佔領巴爾幹全土，能對抗共產主義之攻擊者僅有德瞬國民，期望以禮義由共產主義有所獲者，實尤甚於兒戲。他如謂歐洲以外之國家　能保衛歐洲之說，尤其認識不是，又資本主義國家對斯達林抱有拾己為之期待，亦未可知，然吾人則深知斯達林與其一黨，他日必使資本主義國家知其萬害。　　竭盡一切解除威脅</p>
<p>此次大戰開始之初，東方之敵人近在去柏林不過數百公里之國境綫，西方敵人之距離亦未出野砲之射程，其予德國威脅之大當不待言，今則此等敵人無不被德軍驅離國境綫一千公里之外，德國國民今後固不能不有更多犧牲之覺悟，而今日之犧牲，較諸萬一失收時之犧牲，實不足言，故余不得不對德國國民要求其竭盡一切，繼續抗戰到底。義大利國王及其王黨之背叛，對戰局固不無影響，但敵人所期待者則亳未責現，今後亦不能右所實現也。敵軍最初之期望，乃係席　義國本土，今則不過仍於羅馬西南如蝸牛之伏行，遲遲不前，敵軍倘再企圖於義本土登陸，恐其仍不過徒分　其船舶與兵力，且將遭過德軍之猛烈反攻。前者邱吉爾會謂以義軍為對手，在西西里島之　陸，與經杜佛海峽在歐陸登陸，或由北海在挪成丹麥登陸者，乃屬另一問題，而德軍於某方戰綫仍舊出以預備戰略之舉，其為強化之結果乎，抑為冷靜打算之結果乎，觀今後戰局之進展自可明瞭。</p>
<p>長期作戰決不妥協</p>
<p>現在東線戰事之酷烈，賓係德國國民所未經驗者，但勝負之決定乃在最後一戰，而最後一戰，其勝利必在德國國民。對於反軸心空軍之盲炸德國各部市，余未必予以過度重視，能摧毀六百萬立方米洋灰要塞綫之民族，其於戰後將國內各都市迅運而較前尤壯麗之重行建起，當非難事，因暴炸而鍛鍊出之德國國民，更將形成對反軸心軍施以報復之前衛部隊。此次大戰爆發之初，英首相張伯倫曾謂德軍已錯過時宜，其後戰爭雖漸形長期化，而「時」將軍則未能打倒德軍，今反成為德軍之戰友。戰爭今後仍將長期化，而德軍則決不降服。根據反軸心方面之宣傳謂彼等業已獲得勝利，事實則完全相反，會蟻復會議忙於處理其相互問之糾紛者，是乃彼等之實況，彼等更欲設置各種委員會，以為處理戰後世界問題，殊不知整理現在各國之內部情況尤為重要也。</p>
<p>全民團結爭取生存</p>
<p>同志諸君，德國國民為生有而與殘暴狂露之敵人鬥爭，今後無論發生何種事態，德國國民必能克服，最後勝利終必到來，亦不間反軸必方面人土置倡與否，報復之時亦將到來，鏦目前尚不能及于美國，惟被視為戰爭責任者之國家，已悉處於德軍指掌之內。反軸心陣營曾造種種該言，謂余已免戈林元帥之職，或云戈林元帥已赴瑞典，或云戈林元帥已取余而代之，或云軍部已取國社戰而代之，或云余已將戈林元帥等逮捕，更有云弋林元帥已有掀起革命之傾向，甚至謂余已罹神經衰弱病，五花八門極盡　惡之能事。但無論如何，余絕不感到失望，余以充分研究過去歷史所得，深知非以重大之犧牲與艱苦之奮鬥，不能獲得偉大之勝利，德國國民與德國軍隊絕不容許叛逆份孟活跟于國內，而于征服與生亦之決意下，為國干城，使整個國家固如金城。</p>

<h3>市民防空本部　舉行宣傳大會　陳市長昨躬親蒞會主持</h3>
<p>中央社訊　木市市民防空水部，為使一般市民明瞭防空之意義，及熟諳各項防空救急之技術，特定自本月九日起至十一止，　　三天，假靜安寺路大光明大戲院，每日上午九時舉行上海特別市市民防空本部宣傳大會。昨（九日）爲大會開始之第一日，除第一警察局各分局長均出席外，凡前中央區，成都區，靜安區，甲長以上之保甲人員，均一律到會參加，兼市民防空本部長陳市長公搏，亦躬親蒞會主持，九時正大會聞始，首由陳兼部長向全體保甲人員剴切致訓，對市民防空之意義·解釋基詳，嗣由第一區保甲處顧處長繼武致調，勗勉市民放棄個人主義，來共同努力以達保術上海及參戰之目的。　由第一驚察局警視陸大公及醫學博士渡邊繁彌等，對實際防空要領及防空救念法等，分別講述，末即開始放映市民防空本部及中華聯合影片公司所製之宣傳電影，至十二時餘散會。</p>
<p>市長訓詞</p>
<p>各位：衣現代的戰爭中，相敵國家的互相空襲，是很普通的事，空襲的自的，不外乎在使對方受軍事上及物資上的損失，同時又可擾亂其後方的民心，我國自從水年一月九日對英美宜戰，實際參加大東亞戰爭以來。因為盟邦陸海空軍將士的奮勇戰果，以上海方面來說，迄今尚朱見有敵國的飛機前來空襲，但是大東亞戰爭現仍在繼續中，英美在東亞的勢力，雖已消滅殆盡。不過困獸猶門，難保其終始不來一試，所以我們本着有備無患的水意，應當立時切實準備起來。</p>
<p>對於防空的工作，表面上看來似乎應該由軍事當局負大部分的責任、但是僅僅如此是不夠的，共所收效果亦是不大的，且如果眞的一旦有敵機來到，每一個市民均將受到生命汝財產上的威脅，此種情形，頗為淺顯，不必多贅，同時當地的秩序亦必發生影饗，因此本市一般市民，為着各人本身的安全計，為着保衛上海的秩序計，為協助政府達到參加大東亞戰爭的目的計，對於目前的防空工作，應當一致起來羣策羣力</p>
<p>我們要知道無論做什麼事，均應該有組織右訓練。因為沒有組織，那就好像一盤散沙，沒有訓練，在臨事時一定要慌張不堪，慌張結果那就一事無成，因此我們對於目前的防空事務，在市民立塲方面，組微成立了一個「上海特別市市民防空本部，」這一個本部，是指揮全上海布民做防空工作的最高幹部，組織成立之後，即須談到訓練，以前水市當局對於市民在防空方面的訓練，如燈火管制交通管制等等，已右數度的實施，其成續相當開滿，但是我們不能自滿，應仍須繼續的努力，如空　時如何迅速的使一般老弱的市民進入避難所，如右受傷的市民，如何迅速的去教護他們，如右火患時，如何迅速的設法撲減等等，我們均是要隨時不斷的訓練，最後我要提出一件事請各位注意，就是在各種演習的時侯，我們應當當作真的一般認真從事，決不可隨隨便便滿以為這不果是演習而已，何必大認眞呢，須知這在演習時吾人明知其假，心頗安定，若不演習熟練，則一旦真事臨願，仍必慌無所措，今日到塲者大半均係本市保甲中之優秀份子，亦即全市民衆之中堅份子，應該以身作則，切實倡導，廣為宣傳，使全市民衆在如果眞右敵機前來空襲的時俟，均能在當局指導之下，盡其本身所能為之最大努力，且能臨變若定，不慌不張，要這樣水市全體市民之安全，才右保障，大上海之秩序，始能維持。</p>

<p>即就繫沉敵戰艦三艘而言。已屬偉大戰果，此外更擊沉或炸沉巡洋艦騙至艦輸送船等九　，並重創艦船八艘，　可謂續珍珠灣以來之大戰果，最近　美軍猛烈向所羅門方面日軍最後據點之波根維實烏並新不到顛為之拉巴爾進擊，日海軍亦迎頭邀擊，那開猛烈之近代主體戰，十月三十一日以來敵右力艦船部隊，由彼根維爾島四方海面北上，經日軍發現後。嚴加監視，果然敵一部份在摩納島及布加烏登陸，另一部份在波　維爾島西岸登陸，日海軍即奮起迎戰，自三十一日以來，連日展開猛烈戰門。已達一旬，在波根維　島　戰中，空軍已收得　　戰畢，此次更加以第二次波根維爾為空戰戰果，我方勝利益見明確，且日軍損咨僅有飛機十二架，雙方實力相差之懸殊，由此可知，偉吾人並不以此自滿，我軍將士必將益加奮勉，當十月中旬　每　機數衆多，常以一百架二百架之大編隊進襲彼糧維爾新不列霞方面，最近糾日空軍猛烈反擊，亦已遭受重創，自卞一月以東家襲敵機數量頓見減少，如七八兩日來襲敵機，僅數十架，故瞰戰力之低下，已為不可掩飾之事實，此次敵海空戰所受之損害。一日傳入其國民耳中，恐將引起莫大衝動，同時對於戰爭前途，亦必因而深抱懷疑也。</p>

<h3>新聯會主辦慶祝盟約　演講大會閉幕　昨由李權時等演講</h3>
<p>上海新聞聯合會主持之慶視中日締結同盟條約演講電影大會，昨（九）日為大會之第二日，於下午八時仍在西藏路大上海電影院舉行，市民前往聽講者，更為踴躍，盛況　常熱列，主席團森山需，（任雲　代）（新申報總糾理）、日高濟磨表，（任代）（新申報編輯局長），顏加保（蔣雲　代）（中華日報副社長），金雄自（平報社長）朱永　（國民新開總編輯）魯風仲權（曹由之代）（新聞報副總經理），該會常務里在東杉龢氏曁任　幹事親自在塲招待，全體行禮如　後，首由主席團代表朱永康致詞。即席介糾水日騁請演講人名輕濟家李權時先生，及盟邦實業家栗本寅治先生後，乃由李權時先生首先開議盡「中日同盟說到全面和平」，李氏對中日兩國關擊闡述基詳，旋由盟邦要水寅治先生演講「中日顯係由同盟達到真正親善」，栗本氏特指出中日兄弟之邦之關係。東亞人總為東亞人，旋又報道最近日軍在太平洋所羅門羣島之偉大戰果最後說明中日之　苦並不求於形式，而須繫於精神上，語多警惕切實，未由主席團爼加保代衷蔣乘章致謝詞。對踴銀參加之民衆及蒞會演講之李權時先生，粟本寅冶先生深致謝意，最後放　華影最斯名片「激流」。歷時二小時始畢，該會慶視中日同盟演講大會，乃於熬烈情況中閉幕。</p>

<h3>今後民衆運動　保甲會負責</h3>
<p>中央社訊　內政部近通令各省市縣保甲委員會及關係各機關，關於親織人民團體管理權之劃分原　，及民衆政治指導之運用，率注行政院長諭，曾由內政部召集各部長舉行會議，到建設部陳部長，實業部海部長，宜傳部林部長，糧食部顯部長，社會福利部丁部長，敎育部楊次長等，開會審查結果決定如下：</p>
<p>推進新運及實施民衆政治指導，此後以運用保甲為原則。內政部原有保甲委員會，由中央蒸部，曁宣傳部，社會福利部，新運總會，東亞聯盟中國總會派員參加。　各省市縣亦設保甲委員當，直隸於省市縣政府，地方　部及宜傳，社會福利，新述會，東亞聯盟所屬地方機關亦派員參加。　以後關於民衆大規模運動，由保甲委員會負責。故今後關於民衆大規模運動，由保甲委員會負貴，聞本市保甲委員會奉令後，已通知關係各機關派員參加組識。</p>
<h3>棉統會人選　已局部决定　以紡織業中人為主體</h3>
<p>為主持棉花統置統配而由政院核准成立之商統會外團機構棉花統制委員會，正在積極當組之中，因蘇浙皖三有各產區原綿登塲在即，統制工作不得不能連進行，庶幾於　銷配給，獲得良好處理途徑，議委員會之輯織，以紡織業中人為主體，兼右商會幹部人員參加在內，會勝中日雙方共同組織，人選問題經各關係方面綢密考慮，據日文報紙所載，該委員會由唐壽民兼任理事長，副理事長為意侶靑，聶　生及堤孝，理事為問關事，馮雋生，了方源，郭順，　敬堂等，尚右日方六名，尚未定奪。所貴於卜層機構者</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>所貴於下層機構者</h3>
<p>任何一個機構，囘不以其下層機構之健全　否爲其整個機構是否健全之　　根據，尤其是在戰時依據輕濟新統制確立要網為甚精神的統製機關。為發揮統制經濟政策與經濟統制機關之最大效率計，張化下層機構實為其最先決問題。所貴於下層機構者，我們在全國南業統制總會方始成立的時候即已說過，可以比作一輛汽車的底盤輿其一切零件，甚至　如一個螺絲釘的零件；第一，必須底盤的每一個部份與每一個零件的水身，都是處處完整，毫無缺陷或損壞：第二，還須整個的底盤與各個的零件，除了本事的完整以外。再要能夠亙相策應，其同協力於整惆汽東機構的活勸。我們所貴於下　機構者，其原則正復類此。</p>
<p>最近傳風商統會將召關理監事會議。討論如何盤飾下層機構問題，我們感覺至少有兩個要點，應當包括在商統會當局思量之中：其一，在各同業公會所辦理的事業方面，應使其效法日本的商業組合，以辦理共同事業為其主要經濟目的。所謂共同事業就是各會員所不能辦或雖能辦而不方便的事業，所以在今日的日本，竟右完全採用共同購入，共同責出的方法。僅以防止營業弊害，改正交易方法為整飾同業公會的方案還是不夠的。其二，在商統會所管轄的人事方面，單以「公正廉潔」四個字為標榜。即使名副其實，也還是不夠，必須同時促使其型式之統一，工作之緊張，技術之向上，效率之增進，而調查，研究，檢查等等，尤為強化商統會下層機構所必需之事業構成。</p>

<h3>德富蘇峰本多熊太郎對談—續十一月五—</h3>
<p>決戰與日本民衆的覺悟</p>
<p>本多　結果，英美對於戰爭作何看法呢？後到今日為止的新聞電報等看來，他們的一切學想，郡是欺人之談，他們在打着戰勝後的如意算盤，侈談國際聯盟。</p>
<h3>空洞的國際聯盟</h3>
<p>但到現在為止的國際聯盟，因沒有兵力，終威空論。邱　爾前在哈佛大學演脫英美同盟論，但在蘇聯方面，因為　古爾沒有提到英美蘇同盟，所以極表憤態。續而會之，英美的計劃，要想實現世界的警察　。於是柱歐洲把蘇聯抑制於其神程度，在東亞則　牲日本，此外在土耳其，近東方面，西歐洲，遠東方面，太平洋，印度洋·大西洋地城，置於英美合作！實以美國為主的警察權之下。要之，他們想用國際警察力制罰世界。</p>
<p>以前的國際聯盟，即使曾為敵國，亦得加入，因而為籠絡德國起見，自始即空着常任理事的位置，虛左以待。今次的新國際義構案不然，如是　國，直欲滅亡而後已。那在美國務卿　　的聲明，格魯的演伐中也可以知道。無論德國，日本，他們都想抹殺其獨有的國家性，國民性，而羅斯福，艾登部曾說要進軍東京，他們這樣決定：即加以占領。</p>
<h3>德國的痛心疾首</h3>
<p>還在德國的塲合看來，　　區在和議下被佔領中五年，寶是　鉅痛深。我也曾往萊因河小道，但那種歐洲的廠行並不感到興味，而使我最為不快者，　因河遊船中的船壁上　　：「水船內　　德憲志國　並其他類似的愛國歌者，交付占嶺軍最高司令部的軍法會議。他們、在東京。大阪，名古　等地也想這樣做，他們使最弱的國家佔領最重要的地方，如使比利時佔　萊因第一區·「你們現在失敗了」，這種屈辱感，徹底的印入德國民衆的腦海裏，因而此次德國不顧一切的占領了比利時。他們如其占領了東京，將使日本人照於最甚的恥辱中吧！另一恥辱是為慰勞軍隊起見，使當地的總國人為占領軍服役，這些那是地方自治體的負担，於是德國　衆一談到占領軍，就痛心疾首。現在我們應該知道，如果我們中問有講和的空氣　　着，那時就是敗北了。我們不但不覺悟到敗北之後，就要到這地步。所以我們現在我們的勝利很容易使我們懈怠，而應嚴予醫戒。我們不能不頑抗至最後一人，為昂揚一　人民的決戰精神起見，無論作邊說，寫論文，都可以，使他們對戰爭有深刻的意義，並使他們知道萬一戰敗，就要遭到和德國及奧地利一樣慘酷的命運。人種的差別感極強烈的西洋人，尤以益格着撒克　民族以戰勝者的面目臨向日本時，或許比凡爾賽和約更為苛酷，絕對不會右較為寬大的條件。（　：自十月二十一日　部每日新聞）</p>

<h3>租界接收後的　上海市政設施軍</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>租界接收以來，一轉瞬間，已是三個月了。在這三個月中，市政的設飽，沒有一天不在改善。筆者認為要把使市政臻於盡善盡美，非一朝一夕之功，非經長時間的進步改善不可。現在且就已設施的，作一檢討。</p>
<p>門日夜洞開　七　與八區間的鐵門，原為舊租界的障碍物。現市政當局，雖沒有進行拆除計劉，然重要幾處鎮門，近巳日夜洞開，給市屬通行的便利。甚望以後進一步拆除金部鐵門，使七八兩區打成一片，不使市民柱心理上的有一種分隔印象</p>
<p>烟賭逐漸禁　　烟賭可以使人身敗名裂，沈　在烟賭上的，賓在不少。一區海甯路及七區方浜路一帶，眞是五步一烟館，十步一賭塲，害人之窟，不知斷送了若干民衆？目下市政當局，巳把海甯路一帶烟敗塲所禁絕；又進行禁絕方浜路一帶烟賭塲所；及八區亞爾　路的回力球塲跑狗塲等塲所；在本年年底前，可悉數　絕。甚望市政當局以快刀斬亂麻的手段，一舉加以禁絕，不使這些　窟局部存在·或改頭換面繼續為市民之禍。</p>
<p>教師待遇改善　上海市政當局，鑒於本市各區私校教職員待遇菲薄，便發起私校教戰員補助金，鼓勳教職員教學精神，雖目下每個教職員所得的補助金尚少，但比了往年沒有補助，當然要好得多。聞市政當局，今後擬每月補助教戰員三百金，作為教職負的日常生活津貼；如果實行，教職員得此補助金，常然可減　生活負擔不少。但在目下物價指數之下，教職員的薪水，仍居於最低的等級，今後應如何進一步謀其生活安定，亦屬緊要。</p>
<p>生活用品配給　目下米，麵，糖，油等生活必需品，巳由當局按口　給。至於食鹽，火柴，肥皂三物，亦已按口配給。共他像煤球，毛巾，布匹等，在不久的將來，也可按口配給。但望今後在數量方面，應酌量增加，勿使配給數量，與實際需要、相距太遠。</p>
<p>禁止租　小費　市上一般二房東，將餘　分租給三房客時，除收取按月租金外，另取一注小費，多者占全年房祖之額，少者亦須占全年房租之半，惟利是圖，實堪痛恨。最近市政當局，張貼布吿，嚴禁二房東索取此項小費，犯者加以處罰。實屬賢民之舉，但仍有少數二房東明知故犯，甚望當局容許市民檢舉，切實執行，使市民先安居而後樂業。</p>
<p>縱持交通安全　交通維持適當，必能趨入安全境地。一區南京路浙江路口、每日車輛絡繹不絕，妨碍行人，賓非淺鮮。市政當局，求交近安全起見，裝置交通鋼攔杆，一如南京路四藏路口者相　　；絕對不准市民後馬路中央行走，以防車輛　撞的危險。將來其他各處，亦應照此推行，俾使大上海的交通，達於至善之域</p>

        <h1>1943.11.10</h1>
<h3>Winter Relief Opportunity is Imminent</h3>
<p>A few days ago, the drizzle was hazy, the west wind turned tight, and the temperature dropped sharply, already showing a shivering scene. There is a common saying: "The 27th of the ninth lunar month urges the sluggards, and the fifth wind of the tenth lunar month cannot be avoided." This means that the end of the ninth lunar month is the beginning of winter, and the 27th of the ninth lunar month is often a windy season. The blowing of the wind urges people to prepare their winter clothes in time, especially pointing out that those who "tear down and mess up" either forget to prepare warm clothes, or are still in the afterlife, so it is said to "urge the sluggards." "The fifth wind of the tenth lunar month" means that the west wind on the fifth day of the tenth lunar month is biting and sharp, and without warm clothes, it is "unavoidable." These dates refer to the lunar calendar, which has already passed. However, this year is considered a late cold, and people are still wearing lined clothes. However, sudden changes in the weather are possible, and to avoid getting sick from the cold, it is best to prepare earlier.</p>
<p>Of course, those who have the ability to prepare their own warm clothes should prepare earlier. But what about those who do not have the ability to prepare their own warm clothes? Mencius said, "The heart of compassion is possessed by all men." We naturally cannot bear to see them suffer from cold and hunger, and society should prepare for them with the power of the masses. The current season has arrived, and it is now an urgent time for society to prepare for winter relief. We have raised the issue of preparing for winter relief twice in our editorials on October 21st and the 4th of this month, which is what we mean.</p>
<p>The Central and Shanghai Social Welfare Funding Committee, which is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Social Welfare, was recently established and held a joint meeting on the 3rd of this month, deciding to uniformly organize the fundraising for the 32nd year of winter relief. Part of the winter relief work is to solve the difficulties for those who do not have the ability to prepare their own warm clothes. Therefore, how to design, how to carry out, and how to manage the fundraising should be planned quickly and implemented early.</p>
<p>We reviewed the committee's resolutions on winter relief, including: setting up a separate Winter Relief Funding Committee to be solely responsible; setting the fundraising target at 10 million yuan; and setting the fundraising period from November 16th to the end of December. Analyzing these three points, first, setting up a committee to be solely responsible is of course necessary. We hope that it will be established as soon as possible, and the rules and regulations should be stipulated. Since the start date of fundraising is approaching, it is especially necessary to establish it soon, because the discussion of fundraising methods cannot be thorough in a hurry. Second, the fundraising target is 10 million yuan, which is affordable in terms of the current social and economic capacity. Although donations to public and private charities are frequent, it is inevitable that donors will hesitate. However, winter relief covers a wide range, and if fundraising is done properly, raising the amount is not difficult. Third, although the fundraising period is tentatively set to the end of the year, we believe that if the fundraising methods are appropriate and the relief methods are practical, it will not be difficult to gain the trust of all sectors of society and enthusiastically donate, and it is very possible to raise the full amount early.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding fundraising, we list a few difficult examples and offer some humble opinions for reference:</p>
<p>Yesterday's "News" newspaper's social service column published a report that "Difficulties have arisen in the budget for making warm clothes." The budget of 500,000 yuan for making 4,000 clothes, planned on October 26th, is now practically impossible. First, the cost of labor and materials has soared, and 500,000 yuan can only make a little over 1,000 clothes, and it is difficult to guarantee that it will become even more difficult later. Second, donations have not been as enthusiastic as expected. In half a month, only a little over one-tenth of the planned target has been reached. Therefore, one can only "deal with the facts as they are." This kind of practical difficulty is the best reference for winter relief fundraising and relief, and it is hoped that those in charge will pay special attention to it in the future.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association was established last spring. The organization and personnel selection of the association are quite ideal in objective terms. However, the amount of donations raised in more than a year is not large. What is the reason for this, and it is worth studying and improving when donating.</p>
<p>The patrons of entertainment venues are always in a better economic situation. The current prosperity of theaters and dance halls in the city is a powerful illustration. We suggest adding a 50% surcharge to the ticket prices of entertainment venues to fill the winter relief fund. The results will definitely not be bad. This will cost consumers a little more, but it will be used for charity, and it is not considered abuse to take it. A 50% surcharge can also be added to banquets in British consulates where each table costs more than a thousand yuan. There should be no problem with the host's economic ability.</p>
<p>The west wind has risen, the severe cold will arrive soon, and the preparation for winter relief is imminent! May those in charge promote it quickly, and all sectors of society support it with all their strength, so that the displaced compatriots can reduce the suffering of cold and hunger as soon as possible!</p>
<h3>Naval Battle off Bougainville Island The Second World War Unfolds Japanese Naval Air Force Achieves Great Results</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 9th: Since the morning of November 8th, the Imperial Naval Air Force has been fiercely attacking enemy transport convoys and escort fleets in the sea south of Bougainville Island. The results of the battle have been determined as follows: sunk three battleships, two cruisers, three destroyers, and four transport ships; destroyed one battleship (heavily damaged and on fire), three or more large cruisers (heavily damaged), five cruisers or large destroyers (heavily damaged and on fire), one large transport ship (heavily damaged and on fire); shot down twelve or more enemy aircraft (two of which are uncertain); our side lost a total of fifteen aircraft due to self-destruction and failure to return to base (yesterday). This air battle is called the Second Air Battle off Bougainville Island.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – Since the morning of the day, the Japanese Naval Air Force has fiercely engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy escort fleet, which is centered on transport convoys and main battleships. It has reaped a great victory similar to the Battle of Pearl Harbor. The enemy fleet suffered a painful blow and collapsed in disarray. The Japanese Naval Air Force is continuing to launch a major offensive and is currently expanding its gains. In this battle, the Japanese Naval Air Force, in the waters south of Bougainville, disregarded the fierce defensive fire of the enemy fleet and fiercely attacked with torpedoes, sinking and destroying five of them. They then attacked the escorting cruisers and destroyers, sinking and destroying eleven more. They then twice fiercely attacked the fleeing enemy fleet, sinking three of them, burning one, and shooting down more than twenty enemy escort aircraft.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – In the naval and air battles near Bougainville Island and over Rabaul, New Britain, during the six days from October 31st to November 5th, the Japanese Navy achieved a great victory that shook the world. Currently, the Japanese and American navies are still fighting fiercely in the Bougainville Island area. Rear Admiral Yano, the Navy Press Chief of the Japanese Headquarters, made the following statement on the 9th: Operations are currently underway in the waters near Bougainville. The Imperial Navy is currently expanding its gains.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to a telegram from a Japanese military base in the South Pacific: Eighty enemy fighter-bombers raided Rabaul, New Britain, on the morning of the 7th. The Japanese naval fighter squadron immediately intercepted them and engaged in an air battle, shooting down ten enemy planes and destroying four. Two Japanese planes returned to base.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – A telegram from a Japanese military base in the South Pacific. On the night of the 6th, Japanese naval air squadrons bombed the enemy positions at Torokina Point, Bougainville Island, inflicting damage and returning safely to base.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Adopt Fierce Kamikaze Tactics to Defeat Allied Counteroffensive Attempts</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to military experts here, recently, in order to attack Japanese strategic strongholds in the South Pacific, the enemy used a large number of aircraft to attack Japanese positions in Rabaul, but 202 aircraft were shot down by Japanese naval aircraft on the 2nd. Later, they attempted to use a mobile fleet centered on aircraft carriers to attack Rabaul and its forward base, Bougainville Island, from the front of the sea. However, on the evening of the 5th, they were again severely damaged by eighteen Japanese naval aircraft. Then, the enemy attempted to break through the Japanese strategic line in one fell swoop and challenged the Japanese with a large transport convoy protected by several main battleships. The Japanese naval air squadron immediately came out to meet them and, on the 8th, destroyed the enemy's main fleet. The victory was second only to the attack on Hawaii. To this day, Japan has established its historically unprecedented "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and has maintained an undefeated rear area sufficient to support any long-term war. Japan's strategic position is now able to defeat any counteroffensive or attack by the Allied camp. The great victory won by the Japanese naval air squadron this time indicates the following points: the results of the first and second air battles off Bougainville Island had a huge impact on the enemy and have frustrated the enemy's counteroffensive attempts, completely crushing the enemy's wide-ranging strategy; the enemy tried to launch a counteroffensive, so they took aircraft carriers or main battleships to the sea near the Japanese base; Japanese naval air squadrons adopted fierce kamikaze tactics, engaging in hand-to-hand combat; the repeated victories won by the Japanese naval air squadrons are the result of day and night training by the Japanese Navy since the Washington Naval Treaty, which is enough to prove that the Japanese naval air force personnel have the spirit of killing enemies, one against a thousand.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – The combined battle results of the Japanese army in the Solomon Sea area from October 27th to the present are as follows: Damage to the enemy: Sunk one large aircraft carrier, one large cruiser, four cruisers, two large destroyers, three large transport ships, for a total of eleven ships. Sunk one medium aircraft carrier, three battleships, four large cruisers, one cruiser, three cruisers or large destroyers, four returning ships, four transport ships, one small transport ship, and forty landing craft. Battleship, six to seven or more heavy cruisers, one cruiser, four cruisers or large destroyers, four destroyers, two destroyers, three large and medium transport ships, one small transport ship, totaling ten to nineteen or more ships. In addition, many small boats were destroyed, and the enemy mistakenly injured one of its own destroyers. Shot down 401 or more enemy aircraft. Damaged four aircraft.</p>
<h3>The Greater East Asia Writers' Conference Will Be Held in Japan Starting on the 17th for Three Days</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Greater East Asia Writers' Conference for this year has been decided to be held at the Greater East Asia Hall in Tokyo from the 17th of this month. Twelve people from the press from China, Japan, Manchuria, and the Co-Prosperity Sphere will attend. The conference will last for three days. They will discuss in detail the major missions they shoulder in contributing to the advancement of the East Asia War and the construction of Greater East Asia, emphasize the ideals of Greater East Asia construction, and at the same time make a resolution to announce their determination and belief in completing the war to the world. There will be 14 attendees from the Republic of China, 43 from Japan, and 6 from Manchuria. There will be two each from Thailand, the Philippines, Burma, Hong Kong, Borneo, Malaya, and Ceylon, and one each from Java and Sumatra. There will be three from the Celebes. A total of 82 people. After the conference, they will visit various parts of Japan starting on the 20th and are scheduled to disband on the 30th. Representatives from various places have arrived in Japan one after another and are expected to arrive in full by the 15th.</p>
<h3>The First Regular Session of the Philippine Congress Will Be Held Simultaneously with the Creation of a Central Bank</h3>
<p>Manila, 9th (Central News Agency) – The first regular session of the Philippine Congress is scheduled to open on the 25th. Various bills to be submitted to the meeting have begun to be registered, and economic bills account for the majority, which is quite noteworthy. However, among the economic relations that have become problems are the report of the Price Countermeasures Committee and the budget for the next fiscal year. The Price Countermeasures Committee is currently working with the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, the Non-Governmental Business Association, and the Planning Institute to conduct research. As a result, based on the specific content added to the "Price Control Outline" decided under the military administration, the content is generally to strengthen the general rationing control mechanism and increase economic production materials. Regarding the compilation of the budget for the next fiscal year, each department is currently rushing to prepare income and expenditure forecasts. Among them, the welfare policy of President Laurel is reflected, and the budgets for relief and reconstruction funds and educational funds, as well as departments related to civil engineering and transportation, will increase. At the same time, in order to maintain public order, the budget of the Ministry of Interior will expand more than other departments, so the budget of other departments will be reduced considerably. However, in order to establish self-sufficiency, the expenditures of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce for increasing food production and the expenditures for irrigation and water conservancy projects will also increase compared with the previous administrative era, so the budget of the new government will be abnormally large compared with the budget of the previous administrative era.</p>
<p>Manila, 9th (Central News Agency) – After the independence of the Republic of the Philippines, preparations are underway to create a central bank. In his inaugural address, President Laurel strongly stated that "adopting a sound and stable currency, seeking sound circulation of funds, and striving to improve the credit system" means eliminating the Anglo-American color and establishing a new financial institution based on the concept of Greater East Asian nationalism. The economic reconstruction of the Philippines will be centered on the creation of a central bank, and will be promoted step by step.</p>
<h3>Sumatran Aborigines Participate in Politics</h3>
<p>A certain place in Sumatra, 9th (Central News Agency) – The military governor of Sumatra recently made a statement on the participation of aborigines in politics, the main points of which are as follows: The case of Sumatran aborigines participating in politics has been decided and announced today. This is the realization of the Empire's goal of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and I am very pleased about this. The main points of this announcement are: first, advisory bodies composed of current residents will be established in each agency and department; second, aboriginal officials will be employed as much as possible. The purpose is to implement rational governance and promote politics that loves the people. The announcement of the Sumatran aborigines' participation in politics is the final measure, and further consideration will be given in the future depending on the self-awareness of all of you and your cooperation with the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Daiak People</p>
<p>Achieved Historical</p>
<p>Martapura, 9th (Central News Agency) – The one million or more Daiak people in South Borneo were regarded as barbarians under the rule of the Dutch government. Since the occupation of South Borneo by the Japanese army, they have been continuously implementing education and protection policies, such as acknowledging the residential areas of the Daiak people, prohibiting other races from disrupting the Daiak people's governance, delineating areas to protect the Daiak people, prohibiting other races from privately developing them, and appointing Daiak deputy chiefs to assist in promoting administration. The fate of oppression and decline that the Daiak people have suffered for the past several generations has now been revitalized under Japanese military rule.</p>

<h3>President Wang and Others Return to the Capital Yesterday's Important Speech Clarifies the Three Characteristics of the Greater East Asia Conference</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Propaganda Department issued the following communiqué at 6:00 PM on November 9th: My country's representatives attending the Greater East Asia Conference, President Jiang of the Executive Yuan, accompanied by Vice President Zhou Fohai, Foreign Minister Chu Minyi, Military Affairs Committee Member Chen Changzu, Executive Yuan Secretary General Zhou Longxiang, and Deputy Secretary General Xue Fengyuan, went to Japan on the 1st of this month. Now that their duties have been completed, they returned to Nanjing at 5:30 PM today. Vice President Zhou will return a few days later to deal with economic and financial matters.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Greater East Asia Conference, which aims to unite one billion people in East Asia, was solemnly opened in Tokyo on the 5th. At this Greater East Asia Conference, regarding the completion of the Greater East Asia War and the construction of the Greater East Asia policy, representatives of various countries had frank discussions and unanimously passed the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, and the conference was successfully concluded on the 6th. My country's representatives, President Wang of the Executive Yuan, and attendees Foreign Minister Chu, Executive Yuan Secretary General Zhou, Military Affairs Committee Member Chen, and Executive Yuan Deputy Secretary General Xue and others returned to China by plane from Fukuoka, Japan, on the 9th, and arrived safely in the capital at 5:30 PM that afternoon. The heads of various agencies who went to the airport to greet them included Bao Wenyue, Chen Junxuan, Chen Chunpu, Wu Kaisheng, Chen Zhishuo, Zhou Xuechang, Chen Yunwen, Li Quyi, Shen Zhenwang, and on the Japanese side, Ambassador Tani, Chief of Staff Matsui, and Lieutenant General Sakae, among others. President Wang was dressed in formal attire and looked radiant. After getting off the plane, he shook hands with Ambassador Tani and other welcoming personnel to express his gratitude, and then went directly to his official residence by car.</p>
<p>President Wang's Speech</p>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – President Wang of the Executive Yuan, my country's representative to the Greater East Asia Conference, safely returned to the capital on the 9th and made the following statement: This Greater East Asia Conference differs from all previous international conferences in three respects. First, famous international conferences in history, such as the Congress of Vienna after the Napoleonic Wars and the Paris Conference after the last European War, were merely the disposition of the weak by the strong. The purpose of the conference was how the strong divided the spoils and how the weak were subjected to slaughter. The Greater East Asia Conference, on the other hand, was purely the assistance of the weak by the strong. The former was a utilitarian view, and the latter was a moral spirit, which is absolutely opposite. Second, the American Monroe Doctrine, the so-called America for Americans, is based on racial prejudice, excluding other races and preventing them from existing within America. The Greater East Asia Conference, on the other hand, the so-called Asia for Asians, is the Asian people's demand for liberation from the oppression of Britain and the United States. After liberation, resource development and cultural exchange will be shared with the world. It is truly a world for all and there is absolutely no selfishness. Third, the recent conferences held by Britain, the United States, and other countries have no other purpose than two: A, Britain attempts to maintain its existing colonies and suppress the people of the colonies, preventing them from becoming independent and free. B, the United States itself already possesses the richest resources in the world, but thinks it is not enough and attempts to monopolize everything, making the entire world its colony. The interests of these two countries are absolutely in conflict from their own point of view, but in the view of harming other races and suppressing other nations, they have to collude to do evil. The Greater East Asia Conference, on the other hand, is for each nation to strive for independence and to restore its plundered interests, not to plunder the interests of others. This is a revolutionary spirit, not an aggressive act. In summary of these three characteristics, the Greater East Asia Conference is indeed an international conference of the times. We cannot but admire the merits of our allied Japan in advocating this, and we cannot but express our deepest respect for the cooperation of our friendly countries such as Thailand, Manchuria, the Philippines, Burma, and the Provisional Government of Free India. In the future, we can only follow the will of our Founding Father, unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally, and strive together. At the same time, we deeply hope that those in Chongqing will reflect and return to us, become comrades in East Asia? Or will they make the same mistake again, be instructed by Britain and the United States, and strike against independent Burma, which is not enough, and will they also inflict their poison on Free India, becoming traitors to East Asia and leaving a stain on Chinese history that has never existed before? This is the choice of those in Chongqing.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Occupies Meixi Temple</h3>
<p>Huazhong Front, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army, which quickly advanced towards the Nuan Shui Street area, occupied Meixi Temple, which was guarded by the Yu Provisional 3rd Division, at dawn on the 7th. Dozens of Yu military barracks were found in the north of the area, which could accommodate the strength of more than one division. They were immediately occupied, and a large number of military equipment, ammunition, and materials were seized.</p>
<p>Huazhong Front, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army, which fiercely attacked the west bank of Dongting Lake, occupied Anxiang at 1:30 PM. The 162nd Division of the Yu 44th Army suffered heavy casualties. The Japanese army also captured a large amount of weapons, ammunition, and materials. According to Yu military prisoners, Sun Wenzhao, the commander of the Yu 162nd Division, abandoned his subordinates and crossed the Taiping Canal when the Japanese army launched a fierce attack, and fled in a panic towards the west. Yu Army's Anti-Japanese Consciousness Disappears Hankou, 9th (Central News Agency) – The new operation by the Japanese army on the west of Dongting Lake is now in full swing. According to news received here, all agencies and people on the Chinese side are cooperating unanimously and enthusiastically, which is enough to prove that the China-Japan alliance treaty has had a great impact on the general public. Currently, people close to the war zone are moving to peaceful areas one after another, and there are very few who are fleeing inland. According to those who have recently taken refuge here, the Yu army on the west of Dongting Lake, although not fully aware of the conclusion of the alliance treaty between China and Japan, has heard about the progress of Sino-Japanese relations. Therefore, even the division and brigade commanders are now superficially obeying the anti-Japanese orders from the Yu side, and their anti-Japanese will has been devastated. As for the general public, in addition to fleeing to peaceful areas, they no longer have any intention of resisting Japan. Especially after hearing the Greater East Asia Declaration, their thoughts on the rejuvenation of China are obviously converging with those advocated by the National Government. Moreover, because the US Air Force has greatly lost the hearts of the people in various occupied areas, the people in the interior unanimously hope that the Yu authorities will immediately stop resisting Japan in order to preserve China's vitality. It is expected that this operation on the west of Dongting Lake will have a great impact on the Yu side, especially on the anti-Japanese consciousness of the Yu army.</p>
<h3>Naval Delegation to Japan Returns to Beijing, Expresses Sentiments - Military Production Quantities Multiply Over Peacetime</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - Our nation's naval authorities, in order to investigate the state of the Japanese Navy, specially organized a naval delegation to Japan last month. It is now learned that the group, including Naval Vice-Minister Zhao Guizhang, Central Naval Academy President Jiang Xiguo, Hydrographic Bureau Director Ye Kesong, Naval Ordnance Department Director Zheng Shizhang, Military Strategy Department Director Cao Nantian, Guangzhou Naval Base Chief of Staff Li Yun, Weihaiwei Naval Base Chief of Staff Meng Tieqiao, Nanjing Naval Base Chief of Staff Chen Ruiqi, and Naval Supply Section Chief Liang Dazhi, etc., returned to the country and arrived in Beijing yesterday. The delegation representatives also specially met with Chinese and Japanese journalists at the International Club at 1:00 PM on the 9th to express their impressions of the trip. The gist of each representative's remarks is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Vice Admiral Zhao Guizhang) - Our delegation went to Japan last month and returned to Beijing yesterday, lasting approximately twenty-odd days. The main objectives of this trip to Japan were... naval education and training, the state of military production, and the efforts of the Lu army and civilians. Regarding Japan's naval training techniques, they are extremely proficient to the point that even in the dead of night, their technicians work as if it were daytime, demonstrating their high level of practice. Military production is also enough to amaze us. Their machinery is advanced and magnificent, and the speed of shipbuilding and artillery manufacturing is unmatched by other countries. Moreover, the production volume of general military factories not only does not decrease due to the war, but is several times greater than peacetime.</p>
<p>(Vice Admiral Jiang Xiyuan, President of the Central Naval Academy) - My general observations from this inspection trip to Japan can be summarized in three points: In terms of spirit, the Japanese people all possess a unique spirit, which is faith in the gods and reverence for the Emperor. Therefore, during the Pacific War, Japanese soldiers were often able to regard death as returning home in order to strive for victory, while the civilians in the rear worked diligently and endured hardships, all marching together towards the path of completing the Greater East Asia War. In terms of material resources, the resources stockpiled in various places are extremely numerous. The manufacturing of airplanes and warships is as easy as sewing clothes, and human resources are also exceptionally abundant. A large number of soldiers are currently being vigorously trained. Regarding the general state of society, the Japanese people are able to calmly deal with the Greater East Asia War, focusing only on work, with absolutely no panicked or abnormal behavior. The materials needed by the people are all reasonably obtained through rationing methods. On one hand, they endure hardships, and on the other hand, they prepare to create a situation of certain victory. What the people are concerned about is how the Greater East Asia War can be won, and what they need is victory alone.</p>
<p>(Rear Admiral Ye Kesong) - Japan's Hydrographic Department is truly the most outstanding in the world. Therefore, for many years, our country's hydrographic surveying and compilation have adopted the Japanese system. However, today, more than ten years later, Japan's Hydrographic Department has expanded five to six times compared to before. Its technologies, such as aviation meteorology, etc., have indeed made very significant progress compared to eighteen years ago.</p>
<p>(Rear Admiral Zheng Shizhang) - What impressed me most on this inspection tour to Japan was the progress of Japanese machinery. The organization of various departments is complete and meticulous, the institutions are sound, and the equipment is comprehensive, without being inferior to any strong country in the world. One cannot help but admire the extraordinary progress that friendly Japan has achieved through diligent research in recent years, which can serve as a reference for us. Frequent Reports of Allied Naval Victories Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - It is reported that in the recent fierce battles between allied naval forces and American fleets in the sea areas around the Mono Islands and Bougainville Island, many enemy warships were sunk and destroyed, and more than 200 enemy aircraft were shot down. These glorious war results have been announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters for days. This reporter specially interviewed Naval Vice-Minister Zhao Guizhang, who had just returned from an inspection tour of the Japanese Navy, to ask for his impressions of this naval battle. He kindly expressed the following: Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the heroic allied soldiers have fought bravely in the Pacific region, destroying the enemy's strength and establishing an invincible situation. Now, in the areas of Mono Island and Bougainville Island, they have inflicted heavy blows on the enemy fleet, causing the enemy's attempt to seize the opportunity to counterattack to vanish into illusion. We, in addition to expressing our utmost respect to the heroic allied soldiers, feel even more that the attainment of victory in the Greater East Asia War is just around the corner, and our belief in completing the glorious construction of Greater East Asia is further strengthened.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Sino-Japanese Alliance - Excitement in Beijing</h3>
<p>Beijing Correspondence</p>
<p>Around 4:00 PM on the 30th, I was chatting leisurely at a friend's house when my friend's young son returned from outside and reported in a hurried tone, "Just now, there were extras being sold on the street, but the newsboys were running too fast, and I couldn't buy one. I don't know what it's about."</p>
<p>It had been a long time since an extra had been seen in Beijing. These days were the period of the Tokyo Extraordinary Conference, and the Moscow Conference was also underway. After receiving the news, everyone began making unfounded speculations. On the one hand, they sent people outside to buy the extra. Some people thought it was related to the recent rumors of North-South unification, and some even thought it was related to world peace. They argued for a long time without any result. A person passing by the door said, "Full peace has been achieved! Chongqing is broadcasting!" Before we could ask further, the person had already hurried away. This one sentence stirred up everyone's emotions. Some friends even started singing joyfully, saying, "Tomorrow is Sunday, we should have a big celebration!"</p>
<p>After a period of debate, the person who went to buy the extra returned, bringing a true newspaper extra. Everyone read it and learned that it was news of the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty in Nanjing. Although it was not full peace, because it was also related to full peace, everyone thought that it was finally a step on the road to full peace and felt very happy.</p>
<p>The day after the news came out, national flags were hung high throughout the streets, and the newspapers also carried the news that when Information Bureau Director Guan Yi announced this news at the All-Federation Congress, all members applauded and cheered. The authorities also ordered the entire North China to display flags for three days to show celebration. The Broadcasting Association also broadcast special programs for this purpose, and the Central and Beihai Parks were also open to the public for three days. It can be seen how much excitement this news brought to the citizens of Beijing.</p>
<p>These past two days, whenever I meet friends, no one does not talk about this issue. Those who are optimistic are overjoyed and believe that China's future is full of hope. Those who are pessimistic and those who are neurologically sensitive all believe that with the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, North-South unification is probably only a matter of time, and the unification of the monetary systems of the North and South has also become an important topic in their minds. In short, after receiving the news of the Sino-Japanese Alliance, the citizens of Beijing were indeed greatly excited. (Sent from Beiyan by airmail, November 1st)</p>

During this decisive period, everyone is united and working together to advance towards the completion of the holy war. I am deeply grateful to witness this situation. During this Greater East Asia Conference, representatives from various countries frankly exchanged opinions, and the result of their agreement was a joint declaration clarifying the world, which can be described as a grand charter for the construction of Greater East Asia. I believe that this conference is not only an unprecedented and historic conference for East Asia, but also marks a new era in world history. I participated in the conference and had earnest and heart-to-heart talks with the leaders of East Asia, all of whom were sincerely dedicated and hardworking, which is truly admirable. Therefore, our belief in the certain victory of the Greater East Asia War and the certain success of the construction of Greater East Asia is even more firm, and we deeply feel the great responsibility we bear. I sincerely hope that all citizens will unite as one and, with even stronger determination, strive to complete the war and achieve the goal of building Greater East Asia.</p>
<h3>Philippine President Laurel Broadcasts to the World</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - Philippine President Laurel broadcast to the world from the Tokyo Broadcasting Station at 4:30 PM on the 8th, clarifying the determination of Asian nations to cooperate in completing the war.</p>
<h3>Fierce Offense and Defense Battle Unfolds on the Kiev Front - No Change in the Situation in Crimea</h3>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - DNB reports: At the end of last week, the focus of the Soviet offensive shifted to the Kiev area. After occupying the city, the enemy attempted to expand its gains, launching an offensive northwest towards Korosten, attempting to threaten the German positions at the confluence of the Pripyat River and the Dnieper River from the flank, and pushing south and southeast, attempting to break into the rear of the German forces in the Great Dnieper Bend. In the Kiev battle, the German forces adopted flexible defense tactics, forcing the Soviet forces to repeatedly mobilize reinforcements to join the battle. Therefore, its war results will have an impact on the development of the war situation in other areas, especially the Great Dnieper River. German forces made local advances north of Krivoy Rog and south of Nikopol, improving the positions they defended and wiping out an enemy assault team. The enemy increased pressure in the Kherson area in the lower reaches of the Dnieper River. There were no major changes in the Crimean battlefield at the end of last week. Although the Soviet forces achieved local breakthroughs, they have not yet crossed the Perekop Isthmus to open the way to northern Crimea. The Soviet forces only launched small-scale offensives on the Kerch bridgehead, but reinforcements arrived from the sea.</p>
<h3>White House Convenes Military Conference</h3>
<p>Argentine Capital, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to Washington, President Roosevelt urgently summoned the heads of the Army and Navy to the White House yesterday for an emergency meeting. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral King, and U.S. Air Force Commander General Arnold all attended.</p>
<h3>Anglo-Turkish Talks Conclude - Joint Communiqué Issued - Turkey Will Not Abandon Neutrality</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Cairo: British Foreign Secretary Eden met with Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu in Cairo. On the morning of the 8th, a communiqué was issued on the results of the talks, as follows: Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu met with British Foreign Secretary Eden in Cairo on the 5th and 6th of this month to exchange views on the results of the Moscow Conference and the overall situation. The foreign ministers' talks were held in the spirit of friendship and alliance between the two countries.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 9th (Central News Agency) - Although the formal negotiations between British Foreign Secretary Eden and the Turkish Foreign Minister have concluded, according to British official sources in Cairo, there was a further farewell talk. The interests of the two countries were fully discussed.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - DNB's diplomatic correspondent claims: It is learned here that British Foreign Secretary Eden must have strongly suggested to the Turkish Foreign Minister during the Cairo talks that Turkey should provide certain bases for the use of the British Air Force. The statement issued by the Turkish government today clearly rejects this suggestion and reiterates its intention to continue to strictly adhere to neutrality. The Turkish commentary on the Cairo talks also states that its main purpose was to obtain information regarding the contents of the Moscow Conference. It should be known that if Turkey abandons its neutral policy and grants bases to Britain, the Soviet Union could also follow suit and obtain benefits.</p>
<h3>Major Battle Underway in the Mountainous Regions of Southern Italy - Germans Use Hedgehog Defenses to Resist</h3>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to DNB reports: After reaching the line of the Garigliano River Estuary, Venafro, Isernia, and Vastogirardi, the British and American forces were prevented from continuing to advance due to heavy losses. German forces strengthened their resistance along the entire line and even launched a counterattack in the Venafro area, driving the American forces from the hilltops initially occupied between Oliveto and Ventura. The current situation of the front lines is roughly as follows: On the left flank of the U.S. Fifth Army along the coast of the Gulf of Gaeta, the army attempted to cross the river, but failed to establish a strong bridgehead on the north bank and was blocked at Mignano, not yet reaching the Garigliano River. West and southwest of Venafro is the main location of the main force of the U.S. right flank. After reinforcements arrived, the U.S. forces again launched an attack on the German-occupied territory on Sunday. The number of personnel and the amount of equipment were unprecedented in the Italian theater. The battle is still underway.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from London, Canadian public relations officer Pimisi of the Allied Command in London announced: Every inch of land gained by the Allied forces in the Southern Italy operations comes at a great cost. Therefore, the Allied forces have now been forced to adopt a new strategy to counter the German flexible strategy. Pimisi also said that the German forces use hedgehog defenses, with every important stronghold, intersection, and hill being transformed into a hedgehog defense, making large-scale battles extremely difficult.</p>
<h3>Hitler's Speech at the National Socialist Party Revolution Commemoration</h3>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - At the National Socialist Party's 20th anniversary commemoration, German Führer Hitler summoned Air Force Minister Göring, Propaganda Minister Goebbels, Interior Minister Himmler, Labor Front Commander Ley, Stormtroop Leader Schepmann, and other National Socialist Party leaders in Munich, giving a one-hour talk, the main points of which are as follows: On this day of commemoration of our rise, I am scheduled to stay in Munich for a few hours to meet with my comrades, recall the past, and explain the policies for the future.</p>
<p>Tracing the Past to Recognize the Enemy</p>
<p>During World War I, Germany suffered a tragic defeat due to a rebellion in the rear. At that time, the Weimar Republic (a small country within Germany), although a democratic political system, initially suffered twice the pain of destruction due to the heavy pressure from democratic countries. In fact, it was inevitable that the Weimar Republic could not prevent the victory of communism, because apart from the German people of National Socialism, there was no power that could defeat communism. I have heard people say that they can maintain friendly relations with communism and avoid its threat. This is like a chick and a duck daring to explain to a fox, "We will never attack you," and expecting the fox to become a vegetarian. Communism will never stop attacking until it falls. Did the Estonians and Latvians ever try to conquer the Urals? Did the Romanians ever covet the Soviet Union's oil? Did Finland ever attack the Soviet Union? None of these things happened. But the Soviet Union attacked Finland, moved the Estonians and Lithuanians to the Urals, and even attempted to occupy the entire Balkans. Only the German people can resist the attacks of communism. To expect to gain something from communism through etiquette is even more childish. Furthermore, to say that countries outside of Europe can defend Europe is especially wrong. It is also unknown whether capitalist countries have expectations of Stalin, but we deeply know that Stalin and his party will one day make capitalist countries aware of their myriad harms.</p>
<p>Exhausting All Efforts to Eliminate Threats</p>
<p>At the beginning of this war, the eastern enemy was only a few hundred kilometers from Berlin, and the western enemy was also within the range of field artillery. The great threat they posed to Germany goes without saying. Today, these enemies have all been driven by the German army to a thousand kilometers outside the border. The German people must have the awareness of making more sacrifices in the future, but today's sacrifices are insignificant compared to the sacrifices if we were to fail. Therefore, I must ask the German people to exhaust all their efforts and continue to resist to the end. The betrayal of the Italian King and his party has indeed had an impact on the war situation, but what the enemy expected has not been realized, nor can it be realized in the future. The enemy's initial hope was to sweep across the Italian mainland, but now they are still advancing like snails southwest of Rome, slowly and deliberately. If the enemy tries to land again on Italian soil, I fear that they will only waste their ships and troops and suffer fierce counterattacks from the German army. Churchill once said that dealing with the Italian army on the island of Sicily and landing on the European continent across the Dover Strait, or landing in Norway and Denmark across the North Sea, are two different matters. Whether the German army's continued use of preparatory strategic measures on a certain front is the result of strengthening or the result of cool-headed calculation, the progress of the war situation in the future will make it clear.</p>
<p>Long-Term Warfare, No Compromise</p>
<p>The intensity of the war on the Eastern Front is something that the German people have never experienced before, but the decision of victory or defeat lies in the final battle, and victory in the final battle will definitely belong to the German people. Regarding the blind bombing of German cities by the Allied air force, I may not give it too much importance. A nation that can destroy a 6 million cubic meter concrete fortification line will be able to quickly transport and rebuild its cities after the war, even more magnificently than before. The German people, tempered by the bombing, will form the vanguard force for retaliating against the Allied forces. At the beginning of this war, British Prime Minister Chamberlain said that the German army had missed the opportunity, but although the war has gradually become prolonged, "General Time" has failed to defeat the German army and has now become an ally of the German army. The war will continue to be prolonged, but the German army will never surrender. According to the propaganda from the Allied side, they have already achieved victory, but the facts are completely opposite. They are busy dealing with their mutual disputes in conference after conference, and that is their true situation. They want to set up various committees to deal with post-war world problems, but they do not know that it is even more important to reorganize the internal situation of the various countries now.</p>
<p>National Unity to Strive for Survival</p>
<p>Comrades, the German people are fighting for their survival against cruel and savage enemies. No matter what happens in the future, the German people will be able to overcome it, and final victory will definitely come. Regardless of whether the people on the Allied side advocate revenge or not, the time for revenge will also come. Although we cannot yet reach the United States, the countries that are considered responsible for the war are all under the control of the German army. The Allied camp has spread various rumors, saying that I have dismissed Marshal Göring from his post, or that Marshal Göring has gone to Sweden, or that Marshal Göring has taken my place, or that the military has taken the place of the National Socialist Party, or that I have arrested Marshal Göring and others, or even that Marshal Göring has a tendency to launch a revolution, and even that I have suffered from neurasthenia, doing everything possible to spread malicious rumors. But no matter what, I will never be disappointed. I have fully studied the past history and deeply know that great victories cannot be achieved without great sacrifices and arduous struggles. The German people and the German army will never allow rebellious elements to live in the country, and under the determination to conquer or die, they will be the pillars of the country, making the entire country as solid as a fortress.</p>

<h3>Municipal Air Defense Headquarters Holds Propaganda Rally; Mayor Chen Personally Presided Over the Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: The Municipal Air Defense Headquarters of Shanghai City, in order to make the general public understand the meaning of air defense and become familiar with various air defense and emergency rescue techniques, has specifically scheduled to hold the Shanghai Special Municipality Municipal Air Defense Headquarters Propaganda Rally at the Paramount Theatre on Jing'an Temple Road from the 9th to the 11th of this month, for three days, at 9:00 AM every day. Yesterday (the 9th) was the first day of the rally. In addition to the presence of the chiefs of the various branches of the First Police Bureau, all Baojia personnel above the level of Jiachang from the former Central District, Chengdu District, and Jing'an District were required to attend. Mayor Chen Gongbo, who also serves as the head of the Municipal Air Defense Headquarters, also personally attended and presided over the meeting. The rally began at 9:00 AM. First, Chief Chen delivered a sincere speech to all Baojia personnel, explaining the meaning of municipal air defense in detail. Subsequently, Gu Jiwu, the director of the First District Baojia Office, made an appeal, urging citizens to abandon individualism and work together to achieve the goals of protecting Shanghai and participating in the war. Lu Dagong, a police inspector from the First Police Bureau, and Dr. Watanabe Shigehiro, among others, gave separate lectures on practical air defense essentials and air defense rescue methods. Finally, propaganda films produced by the Municipal Air Defense Headquarters and China United Film Company were screened, and the meeting adjourned at around 12:00 PM.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>Everyone: In modern warfare, air raids between enemy countries are very common. The purpose of air raids is nothing more than to inflict military and material losses on the other side, while also disrupting the morale of the rear. Our country declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States on January 9th of this year and has actually participated in the Greater East Asia War. Thanks to the valiant achievements of the Allied land, sea, and air force soldiers, Shanghai has not yet seen enemy aircraft launching air raids. However, the Greater East Asia War is still ongoing. Although the influence of the United Kingdom and the United States in East Asia has been almost completely eliminated, cornered beasts still struggle, and it is difficult to guarantee that they will not try again. Therefore, we should immediately and earnestly prepare, based on the idea that preparedness averts peril.</p>
<p>On the surface, air defense work seems to be the responsibility of the military authorities to a large extent. However, this alone is not enough, and the effect it achieves is not significant. Moreover, if enemy aircraft really arrive, every citizen will be threatened with loss of life and property. This situation is quite obvious and does not need to be elaborated upon. At the same time, local order will also be affected. Therefore, for the sake of their own safety, for the sake of protecting the order of Shanghai, and for the sake of assisting the government in achieving the goal of participating in the Greater East Asia War, the general public of this city should unite and work together for the current air defense work.</p>
<p>We must know that whatever we do, we should have organization and training. Without organization, it is like a heap of loose sand. Without training, we are bound to panic in the face of emergencies. As a result of panic, nothing can be accomplished. Therefore, for the current air defense affairs, from the standpoint of citizens, we have established a "Shanghai Special Municipality Municipal Air Defense Headquarters." This headquarters is the highest-level cadre directing the entire Shanghai population in doing air defense work. After the organization is established, we must talk about training. In the past, the municipal authorities have implemented several rounds of training for citizens in air defense, such as lighting control and traffic control, and the results have been quite satisfactory. However, we cannot be complacent and must continue to work hard. For example, how to quickly get the general elderly and weak citizens into shelters during air raids, how to quickly treat the wounded citizens, how to quickly find ways to extinguish fires, etc., we must constantly train. Finally, I want to bring one thing to your attention, that is, during various exercises, we should take them as seriously as if they were real. We must never be casual, thinking that this is just an exercise, so why be so serious? You must know that when we know it is fake during the exercise, our hearts are quite stable. If we do not practice well, we will still be at a loss when a real event comes. Most of those present today are outstanding members of the Baojia in this city, that is, the backbone of the entire citizenry. They should set an example, earnestly advocate, and widely publicize so that when enemy aircraft come to raid, all citizens can make the greatest effort within their own capabilities under the guidance of the authorities, and be able to remain calm and composed in the face of change. Only in this way can the safety of all citizens in Shanghai be guaranteed, and the order of Greater Shanghai can be maintained.</p>
<h3>Customs Strictly Regulates Methods for Moving Currency; Limit of 10,000 Yuan for Carrying Reserve Certificates</h3>
<p>In addition to stipulating the methods for transporting goods into and out of the country, the Jianghai Customs has ordered its subordinates to pay close attention. Any acts that exceed the regulations will result in the detention of the goods for punishment in accordance with the law. At the same time, it hopes that citizens will assist by reporting and informing at any time.

<h3>Meaning of Naval and Air Battles in the South Pacific; Press Officer Matsushima Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: The naval air force on the [Japanese] side fiercely attacked the [US] fleet on the 8th, sinking or destroying 20 enemy main battleships and other ships, and destroying 12 aircraft, inflicting a great blow on the enemy. The fact that Roosevelt hastily convened an emergency meeting with the highest heads of the army and navy on the 8th shows the enemy's embarrassment. Senior Colonel Matsushima Keizo, the press officer of the Fleet in China, gave the following speech on the significance of the naval and air battles in the South Pacific since the beginning of November:</p>
<p>Sinking three enemy battleships alone is a great achievement. In addition, sinking or bombing cruisers, escort ships, transport ships, etc., to a total of nine ships, and seriously damaging eight ships, can be said to be a major victory since Pearl Harbor. Recently, the U.S. military has fiercely attacked Bogenville, the last stronghold of the Japanese army in the Solomon Islands, and New Britain, to advance to Rabaul. The Japanese navy also met the enemy head-on. The main battle of the modern era has opened fiercely. Since October 31, enemy warships have moved north from the waters off Bogenville Island. After being discovered by the Japanese army, they were closely monitored. Sure enough, a part of the enemy landed on Mona Island and Buka Island, and another part landed on the west coast of Bogenville Island. The Japanese navy immediately rose up to fight, and fierce battles have been fought every day since October 31, reaching ten days. In the battle in Bogenville Island, the air force has already achieved the [illegible]. In this battle, in addition to the Second Bogenville Air War, our side's victory is becoming increasingly clear. Moreover, the Japanese army lost only 12 aircraft. The disparity in strength between the two sides can be seen from this. However, we are not complacent about this. Our soldiers will be more diligent. In mid-October, the [US] aircraft were numerous, often attacking [Bogenville] and New Britain in large formations of 100 or 200 aircraft. Recently, after the Japanese air force fiercely counterattacked, it has also suffered heavy damage. Since the beginning of November, the number of enemy aircraft attacking has suddenly decreased. For example, on the 7th and 8th, only dozens of enemy aircraft attacked. Therefore, the decline in combat power is an undeniable fact. The damage suffered by the enemy in this naval and air battle, if it is transmitted to its citizens, will cause great shock. At the same time, it will inevitably lead to deep doubts about the future of the war.</p>

The presidium included Moriyama [illegible] (Ren Yun [illegible] representing the chief editor of the New Shanghai Daily), Hidaka [illegible] (Ren [illegible] representing the editorial director of the New Shanghai Daily), Yan Jiabao (Jiang Yun [illegible] representing the deputy editor of the Chinese Daily), Jin Xiongzi (president of the Pingbao Daily), Zhu Yongkang (chief editor of the Guomin Xinwen), and Lu Fengzhongquan (Cao Youzhi representing the deputy general manager of the Xinwen Daily). The standing members of the association, Esugi Kazuo, and Ren [illegible] were personally present to receive guests. After everyone saluted, Zhu Yongkang, the representative of the presidium, gave a speech, followed by the introduction of Mr. Li Quanshi, an economist, and Mr. Kurimoto Toraji, an industrialist from the allied nation, who were invited to speak that day.

Afterwards, Mr. Kurimoto Toraji, a prominent figure from the allied nation, gave a speech on "Sino-Japanese [Relations] Leading to True Friendship Through Alliance." Mr. Kurimoto specifically pointed out the relationship between China and Japan as brotherly nations, and that East Asians are all East Asians. He then reported on the great victory of the Japanese army in the Solomon Islands in the Pacific Ocean and finally explained that the suffering and happiness of China and Japan do not depend on form but on the spirit. His words were full of warnings and were practical. Lastly, Yan Jiabao, representing Jiang Cheng Zhang, gave a thank-you speech, expressing his deep gratitude to the enthusiastic participants and Mr. Li Quanshi and Mr. Kurimoto Toraji, who came to the meeting to give speeches.

<h3>Memorial Service Concluded Successfully Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>The mass memorial service hosted by the Greater East Asia Buddhist Association, which solemnly opened on the 3rd of this month, has seen enthusiastic participation from various sectors of Shanghai and Japan in paying their respects. Yesterday was the final day of the service, and officials from various Chinese and Japanese authorities came to pay their respects one after another. Those who attended included Lin Jiongming, director of the Municipal Education Bureau, famous figures from various fields such as Ma [illegible] Zhuang, [illegible] Qichang, Xu Fan [illegible], Ou Daqing, etc. From the allied nation, Lieutenant General Nagatsu, Minister of the Army, and famous Japanese monks such as Kaisho Renji, etc., as well as members of the association such as Ogasawara Mitsuoka, etc., numbered no less than several hundred people. The memorial service concluded successfully at 5:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<h3>Baojia Associations to be Responsible for Future Mass Movements</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: The Ministry of Interior recently issued an order to the Baojia Committees and related agencies of all provinces, cities, and counties regarding the division of management rights of pro-people organizations and the implementation of mass political guidance. Following the instruction of the President of the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Interior convened a meeting of various ministers, including Minister Chen of the Ministry of Construction, Minister Hai of the Ministry of Industry, Minister Lin of the Ministry of Propaganda, Minister Xian of the Ministry of Food, Minister Ding of the Ministry of Social Welfare, and Vice Minister Yang of the Ministry of Education. After reviewing the results of the meeting, the following was decided:</p>
<p>Promoting the New Movement and implementing mass political guidance will henceforth be based on the use of Baojia. The original Baojia Committee of the Ministry of Interior will be attended by members from the central ministry, the Propaganda Department, the Ministry of Social Welfare, the New Movement General Association, and the East Asia League China General Association. Baojia committees will also be established in all provinces, cities, and counties, directly under the provincial, city, and county governments. Local [illegible] Departments and local agencies affiliated with the Propaganda, Social Welfare, and New Narrative Associations, and the East Asia League will also participate. In the future, the Baojia Committee will be responsible for large-scale mass movements. Therefore, from now on, the Baojia Committee will be responsible for large-scale mass movements. It is reported that after receiving the order, the Municipal Baojia Committee has notified the relevant agencies to send personnel to participate in the organization.</p>
<h3>Personnel for the Cotton Control Association Have Been Partially Determined; Primarily Composed of People from the Textile Industry</h3>
<p>The Cotton Control Committee, an external organization of the Commercial Control Association approved by the Executive Yuan to oversee the unified purchase and distribution of cotton, is actively being organized. With the arrival of raw cotton from the three major production areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, the control work must be carried out continuously to find a good way to achieve [unified] sales and distribution. The organization of the committee is primarily composed of people from the textile industry, with the participation of commercial association cadres. The committee will be jointly organized by both Chinese and Japanese parties. After careful consideration by various parties, the Japanese newspaper reported that the committee will be headed by Tang Shoumin as chairman, with Yi Lüqing, Nie [illegible] Sheng, and Tei Takashi as vice chairmen. The directors are Wen Guanshi, Feng Junsheng, Liao Fangyuan, Guo Shun, [illegible] Jingtang, etc. There are still six Japanese members who have not been decided. The upper-level structure is</p>
<p>Economic circles [illegible] comment</p>
<h3>What is Valued in Lower-Level Organizations</h3>
<p>Whether any organization is sound or not depends on whether its lower-level organizations are sound. This is especially true for control organizations that base themselves on the spirit of establishing a wartime economic control system. In order to maximize the efficiency of the controlled economy policy and economic control organizations, strengthening the lower-level organizations is its most prerequisite issue. What is valued in lower-level organizations, we said when the National South Industry Control Association was first established, can be compared to the chassis of a car and all its parts, even a screw; first, every part and every part of the chassis must be complete everywhere, without any defects or damage; second, the entire chassis and each part must be able to cooperate with each other and cooperate with the entire chassis, in addition to its own integrity. The principle of what we value in the next [illegible] organization is similar to this.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been reports that the Commercial Control Association will convene a meeting of directors and supervisors to discuss how to decorate the lower-level organizations. We feel that at least two key points should be included in the considerations of the Commercial Control Association authorities: First, in the undertakings handled by various trade associations, they should emulate the commercial associations in Japan and manage common undertakings as their main economic purpose. The so-called common undertaking is an undertaking that each member cannot do or is inconvenient to do even if they can. Therefore, in Japan today, they completely adopt the method of joint purchase and joint responsibility. It is not enough to only use the prevention of business malpractices and the correction of transaction methods as a plan to regulate trade associations. Second, in terms of personnel under the jurisdiction of the Commercial Control Association, it is not enough to simply use the four words "fairness and integrity" as a motto, even if it lives up to its name. At the same time, it is necessary to promote the uniformity of its type, the intensity of its work, the improvement of its technology, and the increase of its efficiency, and investigation, research, inspection, etc., are all necessary undertakings to strengthen the lower-level organizations of the Commercial Control Association.</p>
<h3>Our Newspaper's "Educational Assistance Honorary Ticket" - Sales Method Decided</h3>
<p>In order to raise funds for educational assistance, our newspaper has been holding long-term charity drama performances. The first performance was the famous play "[illegible]". Because of its subtle and tortuous plot and its divine performances, it has caused a sensation throughout Shanghai, and every performance is sold out. In response to the requests of enthusiastic people from all walks of life, it has been decided to reserve the best seats for the Saturday and Sunday [afternoon] matinees (2:30 PM) and the Sunday evening performance (8:00 PM) and sell 50 "Educational Assistance Honorary Tickets" for each performance. Each ticket will be sold for 150 yuan (including the face value of 50 yuan, and a charity donation of 100 yuan for educational assistance).

Enjoying a famous play and helping students is a win-win situation. Why not do it?</p>
<h3>Expansion of the First District Housing Management Office</h3>
<p>The Housing Management Office of the Social Welfare Section of the First District Public Office has been cooperating with the Rent Dispute Mediation Office since August 1 to stabilize the rental situation in this port. Now, the management office has decided to expand the scope of its administration and strength in the short term. It is reported that housing issues in the newly merged areas and the Eighth District will also be under the jurisdiction and resolution of the office in the future. In order to ensure its effectiveness, the office has also planned to expand its own organization.</p>
<h3>Soap and Match Purchase Certificates to be Fully Issued Soon</h3>
<p>The soap and match rationing plan for the First and Eighth Districts has been decided, and various procedures have been largely completed. As for the sales date, the reporter learned from the First District Public Office that because the purchase certificates have not been fully issued, if they are sold indiscriminately, there will inevitably be abuses. Therefore, the public sale will begin as soon as each citizen receives their certificate. The District Public Office is making every effort to complete this work in the near future and announce the public sale.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of Oil and Grain Associations Today</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: The Joint Association of Edible Oil Industries in various districts and the Joint Association of Miscellaneous Grain Industries in various districts, in order to discuss the purchase and distribution of oil and grain in a unified manner to facilitate the process, have scheduled a joint meeting of directors and supervisors of the two associations at 2:00 PM today at the Misc. Association Market on the second floor of No. 15 Great Shanghai Road (formerly Avenue Edward VII) to discuss various purchase and distribution plans.</p>

The key issues resolved are recorded below: It was decided to hold the opening ceremony of the new library at 10:00 AM on November 12th. A fund custody committee was established, and Lin Kanghou, Ying Yongyu, Fang Zishu, Xian Yaolian, Liu Zhengming, and Hu Zuyin were appointed as custody committee members, and Lin Kanghou was elected as chairman.

After raising funds by director Ying Yongshi, Xu Guanqun, the general manager of the Xin Ya Pharmaceutical Factory, donated one thousand [units].</p>
<p>Eighth District Baojia Office: Since Gu Jiwu took office as the director of the Baojia Office, he has paid close attention to Baojia affairs in various districts and has spared no effort to promote Baojia work in the Eighth District. Shi Guangzhi, the chief of the Baojia [illegible] Office, also provides assistance.

At that time, all promotional steps will also be discussed.</p>

<h3>Sino-Western Martial Arts Battle: Rules Announced; Famous Chinese and Western Masters Participate in the Grand Event</h3>
<p>The Sino-Western boxing tournament, a fusion of Chinese martial arts and Western boxing, is scheduled to be held at the Allbert Road Canidrome at 8:30 PM this Saturday (the 13th). The launch of this battle is truly an unprecedented event. The entire program was revealed yesterday. In addition to the eight official main battles, there will also be a sword dance by famous masters from the allied nation, as well as performances by the renowned Far East martial artist Prince Ping, the strongman, and his sons and daughters. The sword dance is a national skill of the allied nation. Two people are involved, both of whom are relatives. One sings and dances, while the other holds a sword and dances to the rhythm. The sword color and singing voice combine to create a whole, which is antique and fragrant. Prince Ping, the strongman, once defeated the world boxing champion Courtel, who roamed the Far East, with his heroic power ten years ago. Recently, he has retired from the limelight for many years due to his advanced age. This time, because the Chinese generals participating in the battle are all his disciples, and at the urging of his disciples, he agreed to personally present his unique skills. In addition, his sons and daughters will perform the Azure Dragon Sword and the Spring and Autumn Saber to entertain the audience. Tickets are divided into four levels: 50 yuan, 70 yuan, 100 yuan, and 150 yuan, etc. Donations will be added separately. Tickets will be available for pre-sale starting today at Shanghai Raincoat Factory at No. 40 Jing'an Temple Road, Shanghai National Goods Company at No. 197 on the same road, and the Canidrome. The program is as follows:</p>
<p>Four rounds (two minutes each): Zi Yushan vs. Bao Kuogufu, Sun Baoduan vs. Hai Sheng.</p>
<p>Three rounds (two minutes each): Cai Longyun vs. Pian Mazifu, Pan Muming vs. Wei Ding, He Jinzhang vs. Ma Shinuofu, Huang Jichang vs. F Liteimen, Ding Husheng vs. Kai Bolun, Zhang Yufeng vs. La Chai?</p>

<h3>This City's Municipal Bonds to be Drawn and Redeemed Regularly: The Finance Bureau has Submitted a Request to the Municipal Government for Approval</h3>
<p>It is noted that the "Shanghai Special Municipality Municipal Bond Regulations of the 31st Year of the Republic" stipulates that bonds shall be drawn and redeemed three times a year. Now that the first drawing and redemption period has arrived, it is scheduled to take place on the 15th of this month at 9:00 AM at the Bank Association on the 5th floor. The procedures for drawing and redeeming the bonds have been submitted by the Finance Bureau to the Municipal Government for approval and filing. In addition, notifications have been sent to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Audit to dispatch personnel to supervise the process on site. It is also learned that the bureau has not only sent letters to the Fund Management Committee to dispatch personnel to jointly handle the bond drawing, but also sent notifications to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Bank Association, the Money Exchange Association, the Shanghai Central Reserve Bank, and the Shanghai Fuxing Bank, among others, to appoint representatives to conduct the drawing, to demonstrate solemnity. All special guests and citizens are welcome to observe freely. The bond redemption procedures are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Redemption Procedures: In accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of the "Shanghai Municipal Bond Regulations of the 31st Year of the Republic," bonds will be drawn and redeemed every half-year, with each drawing redeeming one-twentieth of the total amount. These procedures are specifically established for this purpose. The amount of each redemption period is as follows: (A) ¥10,000 notes, 30 notes, ¥300,000; (B) ¥1,000 notes, 125 notes, ¥125,000; (C) ¥500 notes, 130 notes, ¥60,000; (D) ¥100 notes, 100 notes, ¥10,000; (E) ¥50 notes, 100 notes, ¥5,000. All bond numbers issued with the last two digits matching the drawn numbers will be considered winning tickets for redemption. There are a total of 100 drawing slips, numbered from 001 to 100. The supervisors will first verify that there are no errors and then place them into the drawing box. Five representatives will each draw one slip to determine the winning numbers. All numbers that have already been redeemed will be removed during subsequent drawings and will not be included again.</p>
<h3>Upper and Lower Limits After the Securities Exchange Opens</h3>
<p>The China-South Securities Exchange in this city officially opened for business some time ago, setting limits on the price increases and decreases for listed stocks: Stocks priced below ¥50 are limited to a fluctuation of ¥0.25; stocks priced between ¥50 and ¥100 are limited to ¥0.50; stocks priced between ¥100 and ¥200 are limited to ¥1; stocks priced between ¥200 and ¥500 are limited to ¥2.50; stocks priced between ¥500 and ¥1,000 are limited to ¥5; and stocks priced above ¥1,000 are limited to ¥10. Some people outside the exchange, misunderstanding the true meaning of these limits, believe that stocks with a face value of ¥10 or less can only increase or decrease by ¥0.10 and cannot exceed this amount. According to inquiries made by our reporter, the actual situation is different from what outsiders believe. The exchange's limits actually mean that for stocks with a market price of ¥10 or less (and so on for other categories), there is no limit to the amount of increase or decrease in increments of ¥0.10. For example, they can increase by ¥0.10, ¥0.20, or even ¥1.00, without any restrictions. However, they are not allowed to increase by ¥0.15 or ¥1.15. Similarly, when decreasing, they are only allowed to decrease by ¥0.10 or ¥0.20, and not by ¥0.05. Stocks below ¥50 increase or decrease in increments of ¥0.25. Therefore, there is no limit to the increase or decrease of stock prices. However, the way of rising and falling in the past was unusually chaotic. Now, it is tending towards unification.</p>
<h3>Trend of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the first day the securities exchange opened. Trading procedures were already proficient, and the trading volume also increased. However, telephone installations have not yet been fully completed, causing discrepancies between the stock prices quoted by various stock companies and the market prices within the exchange. Overall, the situation is still weak, mainly due to tight credit and weary sentiment. Major players are still reluctant to release their old stocks, resulting in only slight declines. Due to excessive buying of some new stocks in recent days, the buying frenzy has subsided, leading to a general decline. A breakdown of various industry stocks is provided below: Department Stores: Wing On Company briefly rallied after breaking through the barrier, but then showed a slight decline again. Sincere continued to fall. Chinese goods remained flat outside the barrier, with a slight decline on the left. Textiles: Wing On Textile is approaching the barrier. China Textile experienced the most significant decline, with Asia, Seng, and Rong also showing declines. Among the small-denomination stocks, only Lun Wah saw an increase, trading at 2.9 times its face value. Ruital, Xinji, Tianlun, Dagong, Hongsheng Weaving, and Tong, all remained flat. Jingfu and Jinglun socks also saw slight declines. Pharmaceuticals: New Asia Pharmaceutical initially rose slightly, but quickly declined. Zhongxing China France saw a slight decline. Wuzhou, Sengyi, Xinjiu, and Fook Yook Pharmaceuticals all saw slight declines. Industry: Great China Match experienced a slight decline, with Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company experiencing a larger decline. Jiu An Industrial saw a slight rebound. New Asia Construction also saw a moderate decline. Guohua Investment opened high at 80%, Shanghai Film Luo Ding, and Zhunwei MSG remained high outside the barrier at over double, with active trading. After Consoo's retreat from the barrier, it rebounded. China Cement and China Merchants Cement were both firm, while Amoy Canning saw a slight decline.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Public Bonds: Yesterday's prices suddenly rebounded after several days of consolidation, mainly due to short covering. As a result, the bullish forces were stronger, and there was a potential for a turnaround in the future. However, it remains to be seen how strong the buying power will be. Class C bonds opened firm but contracted at one point. Soon, however, buying pressure dominated, and they slowly rose, ultimately rising by over a foot compared to the previous day. Class A, B, D, and E bonds also followed suit, rising by seven to eight inches. Grains: With the exchange open, rice and grains arrived, showing a slight increase in prices. Demand for oilseeds and grains remained sparse, and the market trend was dull.</p>
<h3>Communications Bank Agricultural Loans Reach ¥60 Million: To Cooperate with Various Banks</h3>
<p>Since being ordered to develop agricultural and industrial prosperity, adjust the economy, and handle rural loans, the Bank of Communications established an Agricultural Economics Department in May of this year. Based on investigations conducted by personnel in the rural areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, the implementation of loan measures has resulted in a total of ¥60 million in rural loans disbursed to date. These funds have largely been provided to the agricultural sector for grain and miscellaneous crop farming, farmland irrigation, and land reclamation. In addition to collaborating with related parties to increase food and cotton production, the bank will also cooperate with various banks in the city to handle agricultural products.</p>
<h3>Bank Loans to the Silk Industry: ¥70 Million</h3>
<p>The silk industry in this city previously established a ¥100 million loan agreement with the banking industry. However, due to the later timing of the procurement season, it has been decided to reduce the amount to ¥70 million. Of this amount, ¥35 million will be borrowed by the China Silk Corporation, and the remaining ¥35 million will be jointly borrowed by various silk mills. The term is set at nine months, with an interest rate of 1.2% per month. Payments from silk mills will be made using commercial promissory notes. It is reported that the loan agreement will be provided by the Bank of Communications and other major banks such as Zhejiang Industrial Bank.</p>
<h3>Numerous Applications for Material Movement</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) Since the Material Movement Permit Office of the Business Control Commission began handling applications for material movement permits in various parts of Central China, there has been a surge of applications for material movement permits in recent days. According to our reporter's inquiries, the number of permitted applications per day has reached more than 400. The most common type of application is for cotton products, followed by wheat flour, medical supplies, industrial products, and rubber shoes. The most common destinations are Suzhou, Wuhu, and Anqing.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>

As a result, total deposits received throughout the day amounted to over ¥10 million.</p>

<h3>Dialogue Between Tokutomi Sohō and Honda Kumataro – Continued from November 5th</h3>
<p>Resolution for Decisive Battle and the Japanese People</p>
<p>Honda: As a result, what are the views of Britain and America regarding the war? Judging from news reports and telegrams up to the present day, all their academic ideas are nothing but deceitful talk. They are counting their chickens before they hatch, talking grandly about the League of Nations.</p>
<h3>An Empty League of Nations</h3>
<p>But the League of Nations up to now is ultimately an empty theory, as it lacks military power. Churchill previously delivered a speech at Harvard University on the Anglo-American alliance, but the Soviet Union expressed great indignation because Churchill did not mention an Anglo-American-Soviet alliance. Consequently, the Anglo-American plan is to realize the world's police force. They want to suppress the Soviet Union in Europe to a certain extent, sacrifice Japan in East Asia, and place Turkey, the Near East, Western Europe, the Far East, the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Atlantic region under Anglo-American cooperation! In reality, they are placing everything under the police power led by the United States. In short, they want to use international police force to punish the world.</p>
<p>In the past, even enemy countries could join the League of Nations, so, in order to win over Germany, the position of permanent council member was kept vacant from the beginning, waiting for Germany. The new international structure is not like that. If it is a defeated country, they want to destroy it thoroughly. This can be seen in the statement of the US Secretary of State Hull and in the speech of Grew. Regardless of Germany or Japan, they want to erase their unique national character and national identity. Roosevelt and Eden even said they would march into Tokyo. They decided to occupy it.</p>
<h3>Germany's Heartbreaking Grief</h3>
<p>From the perspective of Germany, being occupied for five years in the Rhineland under the treaty is a great and profound pain. I once went to the Rhineland, but I was not interested in the European customs. What made me most uncomfortable was seeing signs on the walls of boats sailing on the Rhine that said, "Anyone who sings German patriotic songs or other similar patriotic songs inside the ship will be handed over to the military court of the Supreme Commander of the occupying forces." They want to do the same in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, and other places. They let the weakest countries occupy the most important places, such as letting Belgium occupy the first zone of the Rhineland. The feeling of humiliation, "You have now failed," is deeply etched in the minds of the German people. Therefore, Germany occupied Belgium at all costs this time. If they occupy Tokyo, it will subject the Japanese to the greatest humiliation! Another humiliation is making the local people serve the occupying forces to comfort the troops. This is a burden on the local autonomous bodies. Therefore, the German people are heartbroken when they talk about the occupying forces. We should now know that if there is an atmosphere of negotiation among us, it means we have been defeated. We must not only realize what will happen after defeat, but also that our victory can easily make us complacent, so we should be very careful. We must resist to the last person. To uplift the people's spirit of decisive battle, we can do anything, whether it is speaking or writing papers, to give them a deep understanding of the war and let them know that if they are defeated, they will suffer the same cruel fate as Germany and Austria. Westerners have a very strong sense of racial difference. When the Anglo-Saxon people face Japan as victors, the conditions might be even harsher than the Treaty of Versailles, and there will absolutely be no more lenient terms.

<h3>Municipal Facilities in Shanghai after the Takeover of the Concessions</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, it has been three months since the takeover of the concessions. During these three months, municipal facilities have been improving every day. I believe that making municipal administration perfect is not a task that can be accomplished overnight; it requires a long period of continuous progress and improvement. Let us now review the facilities that have already been implemented.</p>
<p>Gates Open Day and Night: The iron gates between Districts 7 and 8 were originally obstacles of the old concessions. Although the municipal authorities have not yet planned to dismantle them, several important town gates have recently been opened day and night, providing convenience for city residents. It is hoped that the authorities will further dismantle all the iron gates in the future, so that Districts 7 and 8 can be merged into one, and that citizens will not have a psychological impression of separation.</p>
<p>Gradual Prohibition of Opium and Gambling: Opium and gambling can ruin a person's life. Many are addicted to opium and gambling. The areas of Hai Ning Road in District 1 and Fangbang Road in District 7 are truly full of opium dens every five steps and gambling houses every ten steps. These dens of iniquity have ruined countless people. Currently, the municipal authorities have banned opium dens and gambling houses in the Hai Ning Road area, and are also in the process of banning opium dens and gambling houses in the Fangbang Road area, as well as the jai alai hall and dog racing track on Avenue Edward VII in District 8. It is expected that all of these dens will be eliminated by the end of this year. It is hoped that the municipal authorities will use decisive measures to ban them all at once, so that these dens of iniquity will not exist in part or continue to harm citizens by changing their appearance.</p>
<p>Improved Teacher Benefits: The Shanghai municipal authorities, recognizing that the salaries of teachers and staff in private schools in various districts of the city are meager, have initiated subsidies for teachers in private schools, encouraging the spirit of teaching. Although the subsidies currently received by each teacher and staff member are still small, they are certainly much better than in previous years when there were no subsidies. It is reported that the municipal authorities plan to subsidize each teacher and staff member with ¥300 per month as a daily living allowance. If implemented, teachers and staff will naturally be able to alleviate a significant portion of their living expenses with this subsidy. However, under the current price index, teachers' salaries are still among the lowest. How to further secure their livelihoods in the future is also a matter of great importance.</p>
<p>Allocation of Daily Necessities: Currently, daily necessities such as rice, flour, sugar, and oil are allocated by the authorities according to population. As for salt, matches, and soap, these three items are also allocated according to population. Other items such as coal briquettes, towels, and cloth may also be allocated according to population in the near future. However, it is hoped that the quantity allocated should be increased appropriately in the future, so that the quantity allocated is not too far from actual needs.</p>
<p>Prohibition of Renting Commissions: The general second landlords in the city, when subletting the remaining rooms to third tenants, in addition to collecting monthly rent, also collect a commission, with the higher amount accounting for the full year's rent, and the lower amount accounting for half of the full year's rent. It is only for profit and is truly hateful. Recently, the municipal authorities posted notices strictly prohibiting second landlords from charging this commission, and those who violate the law will be punished. This is truly a virtuous act, but there are still a small number of second landlords who knowingly violate the law. It is hoped that the authorities will allow citizens to report them and enforce the law effectively, so that citizens can live in peace first and then prosper.</p>
<p>Strictly Maintain Traffic Safety: Proper maintenance of traffic will surely lead to a safe environment. The intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road in District 1 has a constant flow of vehicles every day, which hinders pedestrians. The municipal authorities, seeking traffic safety, have installed traffic steel barriers, similar to those at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Fourth Tibet Road; citizens are absolutely not allowed to walk in the middle of the road to prevent the danger of vehicle collisions. In the future, this should be promoted in other places as well, so that traffic in Shanghai can reach the realm of perfection.</p>

<h3>Beware of Swindlers</h3>
<p>Around 10 PM last night, while my family was already asleep, we suddenly heard a knock on the door. I opened it to find a young man of about 20 years old, with slightly red eyes and a skilled manner of speaking. He claimed to be an apprentice from the Fuyu Transportation Company and said that our goods had arrived and that we should quickly prepare a slip to pick them up, otherwise, the company would not be liable for any losses. He then wrote down an address, "No. 134, Yanghang Street," and said that he still needed to urge others to pick up their goods and asked me to go ahead first. Upon arriving at the address, I found that there was no such house number or company. Realizing that it was a hoax, I hurried back and asked my younger brother, only to find out that after I left, the young man had returned to our shop and said that he had lost the note I had written. He then asked my younger brother to write another one. My younger brother, being young and unaware of the deception, wrote another note and handed it to the young man. Upon hearing this, I realized that I had fallen for the trick. I immediately checked the items in the shop and discovered that a woolen overcoat worth over ¥2,000 hanging on a coat rack was gone. The next morning, I found a scrap of paper discarded by the young man with a shop name and a telephone number. I checked the address and went there, only to find out that this shop had also fallen for the same trick and lost a pair of leather shoes. I hope everyone will be careful of these swindlers.

<h3>Responding to Winter Clothing Donations</h3>
<p>With the arrival of winter and the bitter north winds, the poor are struggling to feed themselves, let alone clothe themselves. They have no choice but to seek help from the outside world. We have recently received many letters of appeal, all requesting winter clothing. We have begun to publish these letters in succession since yesterday. Yesterday, Mr. Huang Jiepu donated ¥1,000 as a winter clothing subsidy. Mr. Ye Gong also sent a letter donating ¥500, stating: "I read in your column that a poor teacher is requesting winter clothing, and I cannot help but sympathize. The salaries of teachers in our country have always been extremely low, not even as good as the income of an apprentice in a store. Various newspapers and commentators have repeatedly published calls to improve teacher benefits, but there has been no effect to this day. I am giving this small amount of ¥500 to the poor teacher as a form of mutual assistance to remedy the situation. (Note: The funds have been received and saved. Thank you. They will be distributed evenly to each poor teacher.)"</p>
