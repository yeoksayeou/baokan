<p>社評</p>
<h3>改進地方基層政治</h3>
<p>新春以來，爲適應參戰後新形勢的需要，我中樞政治，以至各地方政治機構，都有改進；但對於地方基層政治，似乎也有謀澈底改進的必要。因爲地方政治基層組織，即縣以下鄕村政治機構，爲國家一切施政的淵源。某層若不健全，對於國家政策之推行，諸多妨碍；而且，鄕鎭以至縣級政治，若能積極改進，則戰後建國的基礎，也可由此奠定了。</p>
<p>改進基層政治，「制度」與「人材」同居重要地位，而在目前實際情形下，人材之　密選任，尤為重要。在原則上，地方基層政治，應該首先實行自治，使人民中優秀份子，直接參加政治。保甲制度雖爲比較原始式的自治體制，但若能依據新的政治學理，參考當代强國地方政治制度，再斟酌我國各地的特殊情形而加以適當的改革，也未嘗不可使成爲初期的自治形態，進而實現近代國家的地方曰治。當然，在今日若干地區，尙未平靖，若干地區尙在軍事控制狀態，但就大體說，沿海，沿江以至華北廣大地區，已無特殊狀態存在，初步的「地方自治」，已有開始實施的可能，使民力集中於國策之下，而舉全面的簡政之實。特別是關於地方自治的人材，更應立即廣爲培養，以備今後全國各地日趨迫切的需要。</p>
<p>過去地方基層政治之不健全，基本原因由於一般人民之缺乏政治訓練與政治經騐，受數千年專制政治之壓迫，只有消極的政治信念，而缺乏積極的政治道德，國民多能獨善其身，不能協力兼善人羣。因此我們今日要求基層政治之健全，必自人民積極政治道德之培養淸手，庶幾人人自覺自動的從事於兼善地方服務國家之事業。而此種培養工作，或地方訓政工作之要點，首須針對過去地方大患在於土豪劣紳之把持與政治建該人才之缺乏兩點，努力於建設人才之培養，使公正良善之士出而主政。至於人才之培養，根本對策是要政府特設地方政治幹部學校，並在各國立大學政治系，多設民事行政或地方行政班，訓練高中以上學校畢業學生，使將來爲地方基層政治的幹部，其成績最優良者，試用爲鄉鎭長，然後逐步升任，並規定以後非曾任鄕鎭長而有成績者，不得任縣長。今後自治實施時，實行鄕鎭縣長民選時，也可以此爲限制被選人的資格。因爲土豪劣紳勢力在地方上早已根深蒂固，非澈底的任用新人，實行新政，決不能改善地方自治與促進眞正的自治。</p>
<p>今日地方基層政治，雖不能謂盡與省政及中樞完全脫節，然其不良現象之存在，爲不可否認之事實，大之足以妨得國策的貫澈，小之亦使地方有志人士不屑置身於地方政治，人材旣不肯到鄕鎭，於是基層政治永無起色。所以，我們希望政府充實鄕鎮的政治機構，明定其政治任務，首先使鄉鎭與縣之政治相銜接，更謀鄕鎭縣長之職務專門職業化，尊其地位，優其待遇，嚴其考績，使國內英才多願置身地方自治事業。再以政治力量排除土劣，扶植公正賢良之士，實行人民政治訓練，使一般人確知政治與其日常生活上之利害，息息相關，而不輕於放棄其權利。那麽，才能改善今日的地方基層政治進而便於推行民力之動員工作。那麼總力參戰才可澈底實現。而對於戰後新中國的建設，更有莫大的助益。</p>

<h3>日越合作的進展</h3>
<p>日本，越南交易實施協定於本年度吿成，於四日　特　總督與大使府栗山事務總長在河內調印完竣；同時，對於日本，越南間現存的各極條約，如越南的現行法規，關稅貿易協定，及居住，航海條約等，或許有障害日本，越南間經濟的交流者，加以討論，以謀改善適用。結果，越南在建設大東亞共榮圈之一員的立塲上，披瀝最坦白的好意，舉凡日僑入國查證手續簡易化問題，及前此禁止外人從事的職業中之醫師，日本語敎師，通商代理人，印刷出版業等等，苟有益於越南的經濟文化者，祗限日僑始予許可。他如緩和日本人使用上的限制，企業上的日越人同等待遇，以及給與進行戰事所必要的諸種設施與利權，公平分配日本商船輸出入的比率等等，成立諒解，使現行法規條約的適用，解釋爲有利於日本方面。</p>
<p>目前年共同防衛協定成立之後，日越關係有飛躍的改善。當時法國本國的情勢，貝當元首登台後，建立了與軸心國合作的根本方針，於是錯綜複雜的政治情勢，乃反映於越南內部而顯出了種種波動。特戈爾派的蠢動，英美關係的未盡斬斷，使越南在成爲新東亞的一員上，受到許多外來的掣肘，其地位極爲困難。大東亞戰爭經過了一年半後的今日，由於日本的戰果，一掃外來的掣肘，加以本國的政情已趨安定，故越南對內對外無須顧忌，障壁盡撤，終至於成爲建設大東亞的合作者。</p>
<p>日本對越南的這種合作方針，當然，也加重了對該國所負的義務。原來法國對越政策的重心，使越南成爲本國的市塲。所以越南迄今尙無近代產業出現，輸出以農產物爲主，而從海外輸入纖維製品及其他生活必需物資以調整該國經濟。現在，與本國交流的途徑已告斷絕，全部輸出入不能不依存於日本。前年，去年度日本加工品之輸出越南，足充共內部需要而有餘，有許多貯藏起來，故認爲不必一定要依照協定的數量實施。因爲貯藏物資有其限度，故在本年度，越南所需要的全部加工品，恐無須日本的供給。這數量協定已經履行得差不多了，鑒於越南的合作態度，日本在輸出物資上，儘有廻旋商量的餘地，自不待言。依據這樣的彼此互相協力，而產生的經濟上的循環作用，越南對日本的輸出力固然愈趨强靱，而對於日本的信賴，且將成爲建設大東亞的奠基石。（翔：譯自三月七日東京讀賣報知）</p>

<h3>日本戰時生產陣容（二）　輕金屬蒲原工塲巡禮　畫夜不停地工作無片刻休息</h3>
<p>我們於距富士山　不遠的東海道浦原地方，去參觀了誇爲日本科學的生產　之日本輕金屬株式會社工廠。該廠創立於昭和十四年（中華民國二十八年），其歷史雖然談不上古老，然而日本輕金屬工粱本身的歷史，尙　極新，實際的生產，據說是在昭和九年時候開始的，因此該廠的歷史，也不能說爲新的了。這兒的環境。仰觀有富士山，右顧臨駿河灣，左邊是接連的羣山，風景之秀，堪稱勝地。更有十數萬坪（譯者註：一坪即方六尺之謂）的平地，展開於眼前。這大槪是鑒於輕金屬的多量生產，必須有着藉海的運輸，廣大的平野地基。以及便於自己發電的山，因而把工廠設立於這裏的吧。</p>
<p>我們先會見該廠的董事廠長武田秀治先生，和工務課長香川博先生。該廠係由輕金屬中鋁的原礦直接以行生產的，全然不為于丹製的生產。鋁這樣東西，今日在生活的日用品，電信，電話，交通，尤其是軍需品，有着許多的用途，可說是文化之母，是時代的寵兒，有着不能離開時代所要求的關係。最近關於增强生產的決定中，它已被特別指定爲超重點實業，因此不分晝夜趕緊生產着。近頃已使美國由迭艦主義轉變爲航空第一主議了，其重要的航空機資材，殆爲鋁的一種，即此一事，亦可使吾人對它大爲關心了。</p>
<p>由南方運來的鐵礬石（Bauxite），先加以處理而製成礬土（Alumina），這東西在化學上稱爲氣化鋁，是由氧和鋁堅强結合而成的，把它再加以處理，便可製成鋁，但因此必須用到極多的電力，所以由於這電力的獲得及電力的使用情形如何，在製品的量及質上，就產生出價格的差異，這就是對於輕金屬的生產，所以有特須布置科學陣的必要的緣故。</p>
<p>武田先生，香川先生，石川先生，和我，四個人在廣大的廠境內，坐着汽車兜了圈子。先到利用海運的碼頭去看。海岸波濤洶湧，風浪激烈，但那碼頭却用了特殊的方法，已完成了十分之八。現在姑且避開群細的報吿，約而言之，這個碼頭規模之大，是不能把它當作一公司的工廠所屬之工程來看的，從這兒眺望工廠，便見有聳立着的烟囱，幾幢長方形高大的工塲，數條由山頂通至發電所的導水鐵管，這些構築的宏大，不管其如何出類拔羣，無不顯示着近代科學的威容，誠是壯觀。</p>
<p>其次到該廠的生產主要部分之電解工塲裏去看。在這楝宇巍峨的工塲裏，縱積設置着二十幾個電解的平爐，因爲正在行著電的處理，塲裏變得烏烟瘴氣，若干之處飛散　礬土的粉末。套着面罩以防火氣的人們，正拿着攪拌棒，左往右回地攪拌着。熊熊的火炎，起重機的咕嚕咕嚕聲，把塲裏弄得　秘化，呈着森嚴的情景。電解爐各爲約十五尺的平爐，用塗有碳業的耐火磚砌成，上部吊着碳素的陽極棒。數人成爲一組，管理數個的爐，有班長，伍長，組長之分，個個都盡力於生產面上。</p>
<p>爐內放入冰晶石，充作溶劑之用，更加入礬土與之混合，通以强力的電流，則礬土就起分解，堅强地結合着的氣和鋁，就此分離開來了。這個作業比諸其他火工作業，其艱難的地方，不在於像其他的精煉一樣，只等待金屬的溶解而爲處理就算，而是從業員必須在一千至一千五百度的高熱之下苦耐着，一面還要用特別的攪拌棒不絕攪拌爐內的礦石，陸續把　土投入爐內，使其液化，促進氧和鋁的分解。因爲這個作業須在高熱之下進行，故對於體力等，都特別加以考慮，又常　着面罩和體罩來操作，可是到了夏季，仍不免有幾個人要昏倒。廠長武田先生認爲要使這個艱難的作業完全遂行，不能沒有對上對下的體諒，由於這個趣旨，乃對於在該廠服務的人，不管其職務如何，必須在這廠裏，費了半年以至二年的時間，使體騐這個工作。</p>
<p>該廠從業員總指揮小林所長，感激該公司的合理的管理，吿訴我們說：「我們都深知着這次大東亞戰爭裏鋁的重要性。我們都希望多造出一貫（譯者註。二貫約當中國一百兩）的鋁，務使能够多造一架的飛機。這兒在一年三百六十五日裏，完全沒有一天休息的，而且是晝夜輪流着的。已經誰都沒有想在中秋或正月來休息一下的心思了，大家都在十拼命地工作着，請把這個情形傳給外面的人聽吧！」我這時不知這應該怎樣加答才好，只得低着頭默默想。</p>
<p>掛在屋頂天花板上的起重機，不絕地發出咕嚕咕嚕的聲音，把已經液化了的鋁吊着搬過去，由下面等候着的機器車運到精煉　塲裏去，那兒裝有極優良的瑞士製的精煉爐，用它來把這運到的鋁更行精煉而使純化，然後傾入所定的模型裏，使成爲塊狀的鋁。</p>
<p>最後我們又到鋁的生產的心臟部電整塲裏去看，那兒和先前看過來的工塲恰恰相反，是多麼幽靜美麗的所在，完全是一個秩序井然的科學陣的模範。全廠活動源泉的電力，都在這裏支配，調整，發電。裏面排例着二十幾個用以使電壓六萬伏特的交流變成直流的設備，這些設備據說是足以誇稱世界　，然而我們對之却感覺到有着說不出的希望和偉大。</p>
<p>廠長武田先生說：「本廠創立以來，我傾着心身而努力着，爲了指導廠裏的從業員，曾費了種種苦心，當地的人們，起初都不肯認眞工作，大家都不肯儘力來幹，可是當地的人，原是有着在那一望無際的斜坡和山上種植橘樹之精力的，因此只要一瞭解廠裏工作的意義，就肯認眞努力了，所以本廠才有今日的成績。」這是他的高貴的經談。</p>
<p>爲獲得大東亞戰爭的最後勝利，我們覺得今日生活上所必要的生產，無論如何非把增强生產一事作爲第一要圚不可，這不管是任何工廠，都是如此的。然而關於　材生產上的勞苦，不說礦山，不說製鋼製鐵，特就鋁的生產來說，則非目睹而不能理解，　有着說不出的許多的勞苦，希望大家應該知道。吾人在今日，尤其是在此刻，應該做些什麽呢？我要吿訴給大家聽的，乃是對於這輩獻着勞苦的實業戰士，應盡一切的努力，使其心安，使英抱着希望而工作，實爲吾人的唯一急務。（高山久藏原著。丁：譯自三月六日東京每日新聞）</p>

<h3>決戰下之歐洲經濟軍需資源德佔優勢</h3>
<p>（柏林笠信太郞特派員四日發）歐洲的戰事，以德蘇戰事爲中心，變方都盡其最後的力量，互相角鬥。左右這死鬥的雙方經濟力，也已經動員了最後的所有物。但是這經濟力不是倉卒之間造成的，是過去數十年來窮年累月蓄積而成的。現在的生產力，建立於過去的基礎上。也被制約於過去的基礎上。然而這生產力的回復，在質與量上，都加上了新的工夫，其速度更爲增快。在一年之前，我們都以爲任何國家都已經用了最近製成的武器從事戰爭了，但其後我們又感覺到在轟炸下所生產的新鮮的工塲生產物，又源源不絕地出現於前綫。驚人的新武器雖然很少，但飛機，戰車砲，炸藥等性能的競爭則愈加激烈，而雙方同樣需要大量消耗上可驚的鉅量。此次蘇聯反攻的特徵之一，與去年度德國的攻勢一樣，同爲戰事的集中使用法，不惜砲彈的消耗而大量發射。如此，軍需生產在今日已不能不罄其所有的力量，發揮其最高的能力。但是軍需生產的基礎被制約於鐵，石炭等基礎原料生產量的消長，所以構成戰力的積極的力，首先應爲鐵，石炭的生產量的問題。一般的說來，各國雖異常努力於戰時基礎原料的生產，但因交通的阻礙，勞働力的不足、新勞働力能率低下等原因，反而有减冷的傾向。石油的世界生產量，一九四一年似巳到達了最高峯，石炭亦然。</p>
<p>各國石炭與鐵的生產量</p>
<p>英國的石炭生產，在戰時顯見激减，一九三八年的二億三千萬噸可算頂點，四一年爲二億六百萬噸，去年佔計减至二億噸。英國的銅鐵生產在戰前一九三七年爲一千四百萬噸，現在大約爲一千二百萬至一千萬噸。至於如鋁等其他純軍需品，一反戰時應有激增的傾向，一般的能够維持戰前的產額，已算很順當了。德國石炭生產量的消長，不能詳述，但因星期日勞働的半義務制，大量採用外國勞働力，採用採掘機械等措施，曾在時　時續的英機轟炸之下，也拚命努力增進其生產率。戰前爲四億噸，現在併入暫領土之後爲五萬噸，這數字實很龐大、甚至於可以供給義國，瑞士，瑞典，法國，及巴爾幹諸國等，德國則從這些國家換取軍需原料及其他必需物資以作補償。鋼鐵生產量戰前約爲二千萬噸，現在發表則有四千萬噸，這亦因併合了新領域的緣故，實際的能率雖不得而知，但絕對數的增大，無論石炭，鐵，都是確實無疑的，而建立於這基礎上的軍需生產之龐大，亦可想像而得，其機能正爲英國的二倍至三倍。至於蘇聯，大部分的歐洲俄羅斯，及高加索的一部已被蹂躪，鑛山，工塲等均自行破壞，若據戰前的統計，則蘇聯在戰爭中業已喪失了鐵鑛的六四％，石炭的六一％，其設備一部分亦已遷移，軍需工廠雖早已遷至鳥拉爾方面，但較戰前的鋼綫生產减少二千萬噸，石炭减少一億五千萬噸。可見所受的打擊相當深刻。若撇間美國的援助而言，僅在鐵，石炭二方面，德國即已遠較英蘇二國爲占優勢。</p>
<p>就戰力上最有直接關係的石油看來，蘇聯的石油生產，一九三八年度爲三千萬噸，其中高加素石油占百分之九十。這龐大的數量，戰前蘇聯用於農業的機械化上尙感不足。自去夏德軍遮斷高加索鐵道，去冬伏爾伽河凍結以來，蘇聯的石油，至少已受遝輸關係上的重大限制，祇能將使用於烏克蘭農業的石油，轉用於軍需。至於德國的石油保有量，若以德國國內的石油及代用燃料並其他軸心國家，占領地等合併計算起來，去年度的生產額預計至爲鉅大。德國使用於農業上的燃料不多，故目前擁有羅馬尼亞的石油之後，暫時不致有何變化。</p>
<p>德國的生產改組</p>
<p>德國自擁有上述龐大的基礎原料之後，目下的生產業已改編完成，關於武器，至少在去年春季以前，即有充分餘裕從事凖備，因而在去年度克里米亞，哈里果夫，斯達林格勒的攻勢中，發動機與高密度火力的砲彈，毫不吝惜的發射，其消耗數量亦隨之而增加。去年叙貝阿軍需大臣就任後，爲德國軍需生產劃一新時期，用驚人的速度進展，四月，四年計劃廳內，設中央企劃部，決定了最高綜合計劃，而確實保障，軍需應有優先權。同時，原屬於國防軍司令官的軍需局，亦移屬於軍需部，由該部操盬督指導軍需生產的全權。一面幷組織軍需生產及特定軍需品生產者的新團體，使與經濟部的諸團體同樣有獨立的組織而活動。民用產業及輸出產業之中，停閉或减少工作而改編爲軍需生產，停閉低能率的經營而集中生產於高能率經營，此在去年中均已迅速完成停止新設工塲，舊有設備經二次三次改替而加以全部利用，軍需生產方針至此爲之一變，一切原料資材直接用於軍需品的加緊生產，這是去年春季以來的事。生產方面的改組，經上述種種措施，大體已經完成。最近的動員，使所有的女子都到工廠工作，乃爲彌補勞働力的不足，儘可能的用女子來替代原有的勞働，使能抽出編成龐大的新兵力。</p>
<p>現在所使夜的外國勞働者有六百萬人，爲使新的勞働力不斷參加，上月二十四日希特勒總統的佈吿，要求此國，法國立陶宛，希臘停閉與　國略爲同樣的商店，大量抽調出平時產業的勞働力。據新聞所傳，四十五歲以上的女子，也勸誘其自動的申請勞働，歐洲的友邦，全部占領地帶，將實施「歷史上空前的總動員。」</p>
<p>各國食糧問題現狀</p>
<p>關於食糧問題，在這一年中間，變動最厲害的要算蘇聯，英國也徐徐地趨向於深刻化，至於德國，因早已實施了最低限度的統制，故在此一年間至少在表面上並無變化。據瑞士報紙所傳，至去年爲止，蘇聯因德軍的進擊而放棄的廣大地域中，喪失了雜物的生產額四〇—％，家畜保有量五〇％，砂糖生產額八八％，這地域的殘剩人口，爲總人口的二％。這雖多少有些誇大，但其數字之龐大都是不可爭的事實，中亞細亞，西伯利亞剩餘生產物的運輸，因軍事運輸的關係，畢竟也不是可以樂觀的。去年九月一個月的食糧分配額：肉二百公分，油脂二百公分，麵包二千七百公分，（每星期量）此與德國的普通消費者的每月分配量（四星期間的量）肉千四百公分，油八百二十四公分，麵包二千二百五十公分（一星期）比較起來，除麵包之外，顯然有很大的差異。而且蘇聯重工業勞働者及軍隊的配給額雖較多，據發表肉和油脂增加七倍，但仍比德國重工業勞働者的配給額爲低，蘇聯去年度的危機，可以說因從美國輸入了食糧而得解救，一般的說來，民衆的食糧問題，確發生了相當的困難。</p>
<p>英國的食糧問題，亦將臨末日，麵包茲亦不能不實施配給。迄今爲止，雖似陷於窘境，但當　美國，加拿大的輸入以　延殘喘，但輸入完全須依類於船舶問題，所以英國的食糧根本不能說已趨安定。糧食大臣在去年秋會親自聲稱「英國的食糧狀態，在這一年內，將有重大變化。」在商船的擊沈，日有所聞的今日，前途決不光明。</p>
<p>總而言之，現在的東部戰綫，德國在食糧問題上不致有何影響，坦然樂歡，固所不許，但比敵對陣營方面要好得多，即比近鄰的友邦，其配給亦頗均衡普遍，因而能維持低物價，並能確保勞働者及其他－般民衆生活上食糧的最低量而感到安定。</p>
<p>物價問題</p>
<p>以食糧問題爲中心的各國經濟的動盪，並不能就此直接決定其政治情勢，但經濟現象上物價的騰　，在一般人的心理上投下了政治不安的陰影。除德國之外，各國的物價水準似潮般高漲，至去年夏季爲止，三年問的平均零售物價，英國爲六五％，中立國瑞士爲九八％，匈牙利爲八六％，德國爲六％。這是官方的報吿，實際的生活物價或有不同，因各有黑市價格，有巴爾幹某小國，最近二年間，物價騰貴至三四倍者，然上述指數不失爲大體的趨勢。</p>
<p>政治情勢與物價的高漲無關，但因物價的高漲而發生的心理上的反映則直接有關於政治情勢的安定。這在統制周密的德國本身固不成問題，但其友邦同盟國的物價情勢，如羅馬尼亞，保加利亞等巴爾幹諸國的發展，則至堪憂慮。所以德國財政部長芬克說，德國的經濟問題，不是德國自身而是在德國四週的友邦及占領地的經濟問題。</p>
<p>東南歐諸國，中立國，及義國等物價騰貴的情勢，迫使各國不斷的更改其相互間的通商協定。因爲歐洲大陸的防衛，勢必以德國爲中心，故雖中立的歐洲國家，也不能不在經濟上爲德國而動員。瑞典的輸、出半數以上往德國，瑞士貿易的四分之三向德國，瑞士的工廠替德國的軍需生產工作，德，瑞士間的支付協定雖未延期，目下在無協定狀態中，但實際上仍依原狀進行，德國甚至於動員了在瑞士的潛在外貨以充其支付手段。通商協定改訂之後，協定總金額第一有增加的傾向，其內容反映了雙方經濟事情的變化。德國對各國淸算差額的增大，指示德國漸將成為歐洲收買物資的中心。</p>
<p>德國得到了決定的勝利之後，其强大的生產力，很容易彌補道差額，所以可以算是「妥實的存款」。這等於把國內過剩的通貨在戰爭終了以前納入冷藏庫中，一切等待戰後再行解決。然而德國的逾額透借，比英國因美國的武器貸興法案而急增其對美債務的情勢比較起來，問題極爲微細，英國因這負債的增加，减弱其對美國的發言地位，致爲美蘇所要挾，而成爲最近英國焦慮的原因。英國經濟的苦悶，較國內食糧問題尤甚，促使大英帝國的沒落，戰爭如繼續下去，則其苦悶則愈加深刻。</p>
<p>歐洲經濟的變化</p>
<p>綫之，這都表示了在決戰情勢下歐洲諸國經濟的異常緊張。一年之前，與今日的緊張之感，大不相同，發生了多方面的變化。大體看來，有二大顯着的方向，其一，爲歐洲鏗濟進展成以德國爲中心的有組織化。</p>
<p>首先，我們先有德國內部經濟機構的顯著變化。一面，在軍需部長叙貝阿指導之下，軍需工業趨向能率化，集中化，勞働力則重加改組；一面，在經濟部長芬克指導之下，因一切事業經營的管理化，而完成　統制機構。</p>
<p>這是德國戰時經濟强化，高度化的一面。歐洲的商品交流，以這德國爲中心，包含，一切中立國在內，形成一個經濟集團。第二，是消極的方面，不問軸心國集團，反軸心國集團，都因物資的漸趨缺乏，而向通貨膨脹這路上發展。這傾向反對組織化，而有使經濟解體化的作用。這在中立國首先潛存着一般的動搖，在人的心理上所反映的經濟的動盪，繼發展成政治的動盪，這是目前最須注意的一面。因而當前最特殊問題，不但在軍事上，即經濟上也集中於烏克蘭的爭奪。這一爭奪的得失，將倍增二方面經濟的特質之相差。此次德國最後的總動員之目的，即在於此。可是歐洲經濟的現階段，尙未有但接左右勝敗的決定性，當前最重要的仍是戰况的發展，但積極地支持這戰鬥的經濟力。漸成爲問題的階段時，即是經濟生活刺激國民心理的階段。强靸的國民性，可藉此得以激發。所以決定最後的一切者乃經濟的重壓所澈發之國民的精神力。（翔：譯自三月六日朝日新聞）蘇關係、對美駐蘇大使史丹萊最近之言論不願加以評論、記者當詢前此於加薩勃朗加會議後總統曾表示願與斯達林一晤、今尙有此意否、羅氏對該一、問題亦不願有任何肯定之表示、</p>

<h3>我也是上海之一　芳澤大使的一席談</h3>
<p>立在外白渡橋橋畔的摩天樓百老滙大厦，二層樓的大廳上，平添了一位慈祥和靄的芳澤大使。十二日的下午四時，芳澤大使在這裏延新聞記者，他靜靜地坐在大皮椅上，身穿茶色西服，花白的頭髮，容顏還是那麽淸健，總瞧不出七十有二的高齡，他在微笑中打開了話匣，他先說道：讓我先來講一個大略呢，還是先聽諸君的質問。接着又道，還是我先講吧！</p>
<p>我和上海有着很好的因緣，明三十五年的三月，從廈門調到上海來担任領事，做了二年，後來到北京任公使，有六年之久。昭和四年從一月到六月，爲了解決濟南事變，和當時的國府交涉，歷時六僩月，後來又兩三次來過上海。所以上海的一切大概情形，我是很明白的。</p>
<p>滿洲事變的時候，在國聯會議上，發揮過不屈木撓的外交交涉，當在担任北京公使的時代，現在的滿洲國皇帝，因爲覺得身旁危險，也會避難來到北京公使館，幾多昔日的歷史陳跡，依然還在他腦海中盤旋。下面又答復新聞記者的質問這：</p>
<p>我在福岡，要想買一頂帽子，跑到某一家洋貨店去，棟中了一頂，付完錢之後，剛要伸出手去拿帽子的時候，那店員對我說道請付衣料券（譯者按：日本一切貨物統制，施打計口授貨辦法，購物必須憑券。）可是我異國歸任，途中當然沒有帶衣料券，所以沒有辦法，祇好向店家要回了錢回去，上海方面食糖，木炭也是計口授給制啊！（雲鵬：譯自三月十三日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>法屬越南全貌（三）</h3>
<p>— 越人</p>
<p>（三）南圻和四保護國</p>
<p>法國統治殖民地，不採用惟武器主義，而學習英國統治印度的故智，除了劃定一部份直接統治地區之外，仍舊保持原有的封建的或氏旗的統治機構如王公侯邦等，使之坐擁虛號，覊糜百姓。所以越南雖亡，而至今仍有南面稱王的小朝廷，一樣有百官　朝，受百姓擁戴，可是政治大權已屬法人，其職權只是蓋印畫諾而已。</p>
<p>現在法屬越南，由法國政府任命的總督統治。但在名義上純粹爲法國殖民地的，只是一偭「交趾支那，」卽中國所稱「南圻，」包括西貢（舊名嘉定，）邊和，定祥，永隆，和仙，安江等大州及崑崙山島（康道爾羣島，）總面積不過六萬四千七百平方公里，人口四百六十一萬六千（一九三六年國勢調查。）法國以交趾支那爲自己直接的殖民地，是有着一段悠長的歷史的。原來淸咸豐八年（公元一八五八年）有西班牙天主敎士某氏，爲安南人所殺，法國就以保護天主敎的名義，於是年九月間出兵佔領安南的國都順化和土倫，咸豐九年二月間，又占領南圻的嘉定（卽今西貢），兩年之後，即咸豐十一年十二月，又占嘉定東北的邊加，翌年，安南軍反攻邊和，大敗，同時定祥，永隆，及崑崙山羣島（康道耳羣島）等亦爲法軍攻陷。而不幸安南內亂又起，安南·主權不振，對法屈服，遂於淸同治二年三月（一八六三年四月中）與法訂約，承認（一）割南圻之嘉定，邊和，定祥三州及崑崙山　島與法國，（二）賠償兵費二千萬法郞，（三）准法蘭西及西班牙，在安南自由傳敎，（四）安南此後劃地與外國，須得法國之許可，（五）法國商船及軍艦，得在湄公河自由航行。至同治六年（一八六七）法方又爲「維持治安，肅淸反側，」進佔永隆，和仙，安江三州。在同治十三年（一八七叫年）春，法方即與安南王簽訂西貢條約，正式承認南圻六州爲法國所有。安南及法國，都以此約通吿中國，淸廷抗議無效。南沂就成爲」法屬交趾支那殖民地了。」</p>
<p>除了交趾支那之外，法屬越南尙有安南，柬埔寨，東京，老撾等四個保護國。</p>
<p>柬埔寨保護國，在安南西南，我國舊名「眞臘，」面積十八萬一千平方公里，現有人口三百零四萬六千人（一九三六年）。居民多印人，比宋末年，始自印度移入柬埔寨，帶來了印度婆羅門的文化，在明成祖時，曾一度爲安南所併。明末淸初，阮氏勢力大振，又入安南版圖。盛淸時代，暹羅强盛，與安南共爭柬埔寨，北部爲暹人勢力圈，南部爲安南勢力圈。到了太平天國革命時代，暹人更扶植安童氏爲柬埔寨王，排斥安南勢力。咸豐十年（一八六〇）安童死，二子爭立，諾洛登因暹紙之助，繼承主任，其弟希伐太求助於法國殖民當局，南圻法總督鮑絈乘機伸展勢力，於一八六三年八月十一日宣布柬埔寨受法保護，聘用法人爲顧問。一八六七年七月，法巡條約成立，暹維承認東埔寨爲保護國，法劃柬北之白塔邦，新里，西索普與暹，同時以湄公河爲老撾與暹羅的國界。在一九〇四年，法人即割暹羅的排沙格及老撾入柬埔寨。一九〇七年，又取白塔邦，新里西索普三地。召一方面，又先於一八八四年與柬王訂新約，以全國行政權交與法國，由駐柬總監執行。至今王室雖存，實同吿朔餼羊而已</p>
<p>東京保護國，即北圻，位居安南北部，與廣東廣西雲南三省接壤，面積十一萬五千七百平方公里，人口八百七十萬人（一九二六年）爲越南人口最多之區，從地位說，實是進逼我國西南以爭霸東亞的械好根據地，所以，法人獲得南圻和柬埔寨之後，即進而謀取北圻。一八七三年十二月，自南圻出兵河內，與東京當局立約，接受法國的保護，允許法人在紅河自由航行，並關海防太平二埠爲商埠，同時又以武力佔領河內及紅河下游一帶。那時我太平天國勇將之一的劉永福氏，因革命失敗，率領部屬，亡命安南，駐防東京地區，力阻進侵的法軍，加以擊潰，法統帥加尼盎（Frane＇s　Garnier）陣亡，劉氏的黑旗軍聲威大震，而安南王不知實情，又不知外交，竟於一八七四年（同治十三年）一月十五日締西貢條約，承認法國派遣總監駐於順和（安京）及東京，受法保護。不過東京當局典黑旗軍合作，堅不履行西貢條約，法人不能在紅河航行，目不得在東京傳敎，法國無可如何者達八年。一八八二年法政府派李佛里挨夫（Henri　Riyiere）率軍進攻東京，驅逐黑旗軍，四月二十五日，佔領河內，及紅河下游一帶。但五月十九日黑旗軍反攻，使法帥陣亡，法軍覆沒。法國大震，國會即通過五百萬法郞作出征東京之軍費，派艦大舉進攻，八月攻陷順化，迫訂城下之盟，東京行政由法人監督，成爲法國的保護國</p>
<p>安南保護國，占越南全部領土約五分之一，面積十四萬七千六百五十一萬公里，人口據一九三六年國勢調查爲五百六十五萬六千人，僅次於東京保護國。安南越南本部，向爲政治中樞，極盛時期，其勢力席捲全越，奄有東京，柬埔寨及南圻諸地。不過當法國佔領南圻，論柬埔寨爲保護國後，王室聲勢衰頹，一八七四年一二月十五日，不明虛實，經與法締西貢條約，已自陷於保護國的地位而不覺。後東京當局聯我劉永幅　黑旗軍抗法連捷，而安南王朝竟漫無準備，及一八八二年八月，法艦大舉進攻，登陸順化，城下締监，條約的主要內容是：（一）安南爲法國的保護國，（二）外交由法國代辦：（三）安南東京，各設法國總監及行政官；（四）割平順併於法；（五）闢歸仁廣南，修安爲商埠（六）法在東京對黑旗軍有自由剿辦權；（七）海關財政由法人管理；（八）東京行政由法人監督。自此安南東京都成爲保護國了。</p>
<p>老撾保護國，在安南之西，與泰國及緬甸交界，面積二十三萬一千四百平方公里，占越南諸國第一位，比兩個江蘇省還大，人口據一九三六年國勢調查爲一百零一萬二千人，每平方公里不過四·三七人，爲越南人口最稀之國。其住民在二千年前，由我國四川雲貴等處移入，分布於湄公河兩岸及湄南河上游，與中國的苗傜，儸儸等同源。淸乾隆時曾被暹邏侵佔，以逼安南，結果以湄公河爲安暹兩國分界。當法國勢力浸潤南圻之時，老撾爲暹羅所併。一八八二年法國席捲南圻，柬埔寨，東京安南以後，即通牒暹羅，請恢復　日安南版圖下的老撾國界，限暹軍撤至湄公河以西。一八九三年，法國實行武裝劃界，促暹撤兵十月三日，訂立所謂湄公條約，（一）暹羅承認北緯二十三度以南湄公左岸之地爲柬埔寨與安南所有：（二）暹羅允在一個月內將駐守湄公河左岸軍隊一律撤回；（三）暹羅兵船不准在湄公河內航行：（四）暹羅不准在湄公河沿岸十五英里之地建築砲壘；（五）暹雜賠償法國軍費二百萬法郞從此老撾也爲法國勢力範圍。一八九六年英法協商，一月十六日訂約，兩國保障暹羅獨立，法國勢力以湄公河爲界。一九零四年英法及法暹協定，法國勢力更及湄公河西七千八百里。於是老撾保護國的地位確定了。</p>
<p>法國在交趾支那設殖民地長官，在各保護國，派遣總監。而以常駐河內的印度支那總督總理越南殖民地及保護國的政務。並設總督府會議，總督府會議駐會委員會，經濟財政最高會議等三者，作爲法屬印度支那總督的高等諮詢機關。又各國則在交趾支那設有交趾支那參事會，老撾以外三國各設保護會議。以外，交趾支那設有殖民地會議，東京，安南，柬埔寨有經濟財政會議，東京，安南有人民會議，柬埔寨及老撾則有土人諮問會議。由此可見法國統治者對於越南的統治，大２上都模倣英美，探取懷柔政策及有限制的民主制度，以為收復人心之策。</p>

<h3>新移動取締與上海經濟界</h3>
<p>關於改革物資移動限制制度及物資進出機構，本市中日經濟界人士均表關心，尤以關於收買配給內地物資之日商特權　位，已　根本修正，今後之交易機構如何組織，日方極爲關心，以下爲日華兩方之觀測。</p>
<p>日商之觀測</p>
<p>吾人早知對華新政策決定後，華中之經濟必須以新事態基礎而重加調整。今次之經濟改組，爲新方針決定後之必然歸結，吾人須從新的立塲，謀中日經濟人之携手，加强國府，同時促進華中經濟之參戰體制，關於此點，日商方面均有決心，不至再成問題，但所憂慮者，物資收買配給機構之改組，已見公布，其機構雖爲一般人所理想者，但運用如何，關係至大，如能達到加强國府機構，則華中經濟之戰時體制，亦能促進，故今後如何運用此機構，極可注目，歸根結論，尙在於華商方面之道義問題，此次當局之英斷，對於民心頗多影響，華商方面視綫轉變，均能抱定決心，相信其必能順利推進。下層機構之詳情，尙未發表，毋庸多述，總之，華商之覺悟，如能淸楚，則下層機構亦必健全，現在如何組織機構，實爲吾人之最大關心！</p>
<p>華商之觀測</p>
<p>上海之華方經濟界</p>
<p>對於此次改革物資統制，咸表好感，對於友邦日本之好意，深表感謝，知識人士豚爲華方之自治統制實現後，中國之責任，較前更重，力言一切物資收買配給，應取中日平等之立塲，爲期全國商業統制總會之運用萬全起見，希望日方經濟界人士對於缺乏經濟統制經騐之中國，多予援助。（雲鵬：譯自三月十三日大陸新報）、</p>
<p>經濟評言</p>
<h3>所望於全國商業統制總會者</h3>
<p>參戰以來，中國經濟界第一件大事爲「戰時經濟政策綱領」的頒佈，第二件大事爲戰時物資移動取締條例的規訂與「全國商業統制總會」的設置。前者爲因，後者爲果；前者爲一般的原則，後者爲辦法的一種：這樣一個辦法，確爲實施戰時經濟政策綱領」一的一個基幹，因爲「戰時經濟政策綱領」中最主要的條件，爲「增加生產與「調劑物價。</p>
<p>不久以前，本報「經濟界」亦曾邀集上海工商界領袖開過一次物價懇談會：討論的結果，認爲民間所切望於當局者，不外增加生產原料，疏通物資來源，注意統制辦法，强化商業機構，（見二月二十七日本版）。相隔不過兩星期，我們的企望，可算是如願以償了；這樣一個辦法，在當局爲英明的措置，在人民爲福利的泉源，自覺毫無疑義。</p>
<p>物資移動的取締與統制總會的設置，原來可以併爲一談，因爲它們的關係是連帶的。所以，梅實業部長在他所發表的談話中，有過這樣幾句：「戰時物資栘動取締辦法，係一種暫時的措施；以後全國商業統制總會的下層組織，能達到普遍强化的階段，即可　成該會整個負責辦理一切物資移動之自治的統制，故希望各地人民了解政府的政策精神，積極自動强化各業本身之組識」。我們覺得這幾句話，堪以耐人尋味。</p>
<p>全國商業統制總會的設置，是具有雙重意味的，其一是當局對於人民信任心的表現，其一是人民對於當局責任心的表現；因爲，當局毅然以經濟統制之權，付諸人民，這是當局的信任心；人民樂於接受這樣一個繁賾的重任，毫無難色，這是人民的責任心。信任心與責任心，合併起來，便足成爲眞誠的合作，眞誠的經濟合作。此外，一方圓的信任心，足以喚起對一方面的責任心，而一方面的責任心，亦足以加强對一方面的信任心，所以兩者的關係，復是相互的。</p>
<p>站在民間經濟界的立塲，我們祇談責任問題。我們旣然把握着全國經濟統制的權威，我們當然要以負起實任做出成績爲第一要義。須知凡百事件，權威所在，不一定是成績所在，而成績所在，却就是權威所在，這句話並非哲學，却爲至理。</p>
<p>我們深知道全國商業統制總會僱爲一個强有力的民間經濟機構，我們也深知道全國商業統制總會的主持者，必爲民間經濟界的第一流人才，因爲如此，所以我們對於這一個新機構的願望，俞覺其殷。我們唯一的願望，就是强化這一個新機構的下層組織，尤當注意於下層組織中的人事問題。過去的事實吿訴我們，無論在中國政治機構或商業機構方面，往往有着很完善的制度，很賢明的首領，祇因下層組織裏面，未加澄淸，發生腐化，遂至聲譽墮地，全功盡棄，這是已往最堪痛心的，也就是今後最須提防的。這樣一個事態，好有一比，比作一輛極其富麗堂皇的汽車，整個機器的構迭，旣極堅固，駕駛人具的技術，復極高超，祇因汽車底盤的零件，——甚至微如一個螺絲釘的零件，——發生缺憾，以致這輛車子發生毛病，至被交通警察指爲駕駛小愼，豈不寃枉？所以駕車者雖明知所駕者爲一新式車輛，終宜提防車底所裝一切零件，是否支配完整，有無損壞情形。我們所望於行將成立之全國商業統制會者，亦復如此，就是，强化　層組織，愼選下級人員，以公正廉潔四個字，作爲選擇下級人員的條件，訓練下級人員的課題：待遇不妨提高，管約必須嚴格。這是强化下層組織的先決問題，亦即是强化整個機構的先決問題。</p>
<h3>銀錢業各行莊　實施緊縮貨款　期限折扣俱依辦理　對於調查審核極端慎重</h3>
<p>銀錢兩業同業公會會員行莊，遵照聯合會議決之銀錢業放款新辦法，予以緊縮限制放款，而免助長投機囤積後，頃各行莊對於一切放款，均已極端審愼，同時對調查審查特設類似專部之組織，調派熟悉各業情形者充任之，負責辦理，（一）調查各業營業狀况以及信用。（二）調查貨物市價。（三）審查申請者之正當用途，如認爲其借款用途足以助長投機者，拒絕貸放。申請者以各該業同業公會會員領有主管機關之營業執照或經登記註冊許可者爲限。押款担保之貨物，必須證明持有人之目的非爲國積圖利，日用必需之品，均予拒絕，關於放款「期限，估價，折扣」等，均依照法令辦理。至於利率一層，均已參酌市面情形，分別酌予提高月息至二分至三分不等云。</p>
<h3>華中煙草組合通告　合格批發商繳信認金　本月十五起十七日止　甲A五萬甲方B三萬元</h3>
<p>關於華中烟草配給組合辦理本埠各捲烟店捲烟配給事宜，各項準備手續，辦理均巳相當就緒，各登記捲烟店之資格審查，亦已完竣。茲探悉組合方面，對於業經審查合格之批發商，昨日發出通吿，着即自十五日起至十七日止，三日之內，繳納「信認金」，甲A級五萬元，甲B級三萬元，款交江西路菸業銀行代收，再向組合方面掉換正式收據，並領取「御賣商」即指定批發商之木牌一塊，着各店懸掛於顯明之處，以資識別，至十八日組合方面將召集全市登記同業二百八十餘家，在市商會開會，指示營業方針，然後開始辦理派貨。至將來派貨以後，各烟店必須詳細紀錄營業賬册，以便組合方面隨時派員調查云。</p>
<h3>華與銀行　在內地增設支行</h3>
<p>華興商業銀行，於民國三十年一月，將發行紙幣權讓與中央儲備銀行，以純粹商業銀行之地位，在金融界活動，指導一般商業銀行，近爲擴展業務計，除在漢口設立支行外，同時決定擴大內地之支行，過去內地分支行僅有十處，今次添設「漢口，九江，安慶」三支行後，必能加緊吸收內地之游資，同時在貸款方面可與專事收買農產之合作社取得密切聯絡，發展一切農業云。（三月十三日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>連升三日　聯鈔買氣仍濃　—盤旋於四元關口—</h3>
<p>昨聯銀券漲風未戢，客胃濃厚，本市各方買意亦股，經營者由三元九角左右，變做升至四元關口始有賣戶，收進亦抬至三元九角半，又軋升一角，查已連升三天，共升五角，門市售出須四元〇五分。收進三元八角，亦見提上云。</p>
<p>軍票稍低落，外幣市况，日軍票稍見低落，週六拆息關係，經營者供多求少，同業互做五元五角五分二三厘，小錢莊與銀號門市出入價五元五角六分及四分半云。</p>
<p>拆息仍平定昨晨錢業公會拆息，仍爲一角八分，絕鮮更動。</p>
<h3>華北節省燃料　嚴限汽車　—運貨車祇供送主要品—</h3>
<p>北平十三日海通社電，爲節省燃料計，華北汽車之交通，限制頗嚴，由學校接送學生，及由工廠接送工人之大汽車，仍准行駛，但以路程不超過三公里爲限，運貨汽車祗供運送主要產品之用。</p>

<h3>本年度農民生活之檢討與期待</h3>
<p>— 聖堅</p>
<p>近來對於經濟問題之檢討堪稱蓬勃一時，但多側重於工商方面，鮮有注意於農事者。雖有人計劃或提議開發農村經濟，鼓勵銀錢界經營農業貸款，然迄今未聞有實行者。</p>
<p>農業在國家經濟上之重要性，實較工商業爲尤甚。商業爲物與　之溝通運用，工業爲將原物製爲成品，亦僅屬於半生產事業。農業則自耕種土地所得，而並不損及土地，實爲純生產事業。物產之泉源，可以用之不盡者，當爲農業。</p>
<p>農業之重要性，旣如上述。中國爲農業國，而中國之經濟界智識界對於農業絕少援手，且大都漠不關心，以致農民之耕種方法，默守數千年來之舊法，無由改進，未墾種之土地尙多，亦無法開拓。此非農民之不思改良種植方法與增闢土地，實由于智識界之未曾從事于農民智識之灌輸，農村敎育之未曾發達，更由於經濟界無意于農村之投資。</p>
<p>今日之中國農業，絕少集資經營者，大都爲小家庭之耕種，視人數之多少而定耕種田畝之多少，最多者爲十畝至二十畝之農戶；百畝以上則極少見，蓋一人之力量，僅可耕地三四畝。因耕種方面之不能改善，故農村經濟，非常艱苦。在晨忙時期，以古舊之方法與農具，耕種三四畝之田地，已須日夜工作，農忙一過，則又無事可做。農村副業，中國亦素未力致，農民經濟之薄弱，缺乏副業爲其輔助，亦一主因。</p>
<p>農業旣爲國家經濟之基礎，不容忽視，而須加以扶掖，則農民之生產與消費，自須加以檢討。今日農民之生活收支，實已不能平衡。此種問題，現已十分切要。較之改良種植方法及拓地等，更爲嚴重。而尙未爲國人所注意者。</p>
<p>現在之農戶所耕土地，大都爲十畝至二十畝者。今試舉一家三人耕地十畝之一年收支狀况，巳可知農民生活之不能安定。</p>
<p>今試以錫常等地帶最優良之農田收支數字，列表如左：（十畝計算）</p>
<p>田間收穫：</p>
<p>米（最佳收穫每畝石弱最低收穫每畝一石平均數三石）二〇</p>
<p>石價值（產地價）……五〇〇〇·〇〇元</p>
<p>麥（六畝）六石……一五〇〇·〇〇元</p>
<p>油菜（二畝）二石……一〇〇〇·〇〇元</p>
<p>雜糧（二畝）……六〇〇·〇〇元</p>
<p>柴（稻麥稈等）……六〇〇·〇〇元</p>
<p>總計收入……八七〇〇·〇〇元</p>
<p>種植資本：</p>
<p>肥料（貧瘠地尙須照下列數增加百分之六十）</p>
<p>荳餅六〇〇斤……現值　七二〇·〇〇元</p>
<p>灰及人糞七〇〇斤　（自有三〇〇）　（添購四〇〇）……現值　二四〇·〇〇</p>
<p>雜肥……現值　四〇〇·〇〇元</p>
<p>合計一三六〇·〇〇……平均每畝一三六·〇〇元</p>
<p>機器戽水（牛及人工加倍）……六〇〇·〇〇元</p>
<p>僱工　四十工（揷秧及收稻等三人不）　（及工作必須臨時僱工）……四〇〇·〇〇元</p>
<p>還租每畝租額以九斗計算照市價七折實還…一五七五·〇〇元</p>
<p>總計支出資金……三九三五·〇〇元</p>
<p>收支相抵純養爲……四七六五·〇〇元</p>
<p>一家三人一年度之生活費（農村生活之最低限度計算）：</p>
<p>食米七·五石……價值一八七五·〇〇元</p>
<p>小麥二·五石……價值六二五·〇〇元</p>
<p>燃料（每月五十元）……價值六〇〇·〇〇元</p>
<p>食油與燈油（每日一元五角）……價值五四〇·〇〇元</p>
<p>鹽……一〇〇·〇〇元</p>
<p>火柴五日一小盒……一八·〇〇元</p>
<p>肥白半月一塊……二六四·〇〇元</p>
<p>衣服　每人一年中添製土布短衣四件共十二件計春秋季一件冬季夏季各一件……七二〇·〇〇元</p>
<p>鞋襪……二〇〇·〇〇元</p>
<p>農具修理……三四〇·〇〇元</p>
<p>醫藥……三〇〇·〇元</p>
<p>其他……七二〇·〇〇元</p>
<p>總計　六三〇二·〇〇　純益所行相抵尚少一五三七·〇〇元</p>
<p>上列之收穫數，爲現在耕種收穫之平均數字，極爲凖確。月係指稻與麥兩皆可種之良田；若棉田與桑田，則收穫尙不滿此數。</p>
<p>支出項中之還租一項，係指租田耕種者，自有田畝者，僅須納國家糧稅。至多只須照還租數完納百分之二十，但農民之自有耕田者，百不得一，　有多數貧農並未交付租田價者，除還租外，再需還小租。不以租額折價計算，每畝須還米三斗至六斗，視田之優劣而定。須還小租之農民，常因無力還租而移往都市做工者頗不乏人。</p>
<p>以言生活費之食米一項，農民旣爲勞働工作者，上列數字實爲最低限度，大都尙不止此數，况菜肴等亦未列入，因有自種之蔬菜。但一年數度之祭祀，以及宗敎迷信上等消費，親戚之往還，老年人與小兒等不能工作者，均未列入計算。但已不能維持生活，皆因米價在產地售價，較之肥料及生活用品高漲之價不同。本年米價較事變時價値高漲爲二十倍强，肥料價則達四十五倍至六十倍，而日用品衣料等則高漲至七十倍至一百二十倍。以前以米一斗易衣一襲，今則非三斗不可。米一升可易肥皂三塊，今則需一斗二升。今日之米價固高，但其他物品之價更高，若不籌切實救濟方法，則今年度之農村經濟，必達嚴重關頭。救濟方法，不外下列諸端：</p>
<p>（一）實施農肥低價配給。</p>
<p>（一）改善鄉村日用品配給方法。</p>
<p>（一）增加日用品配給數量。上述數點僅爲經濟上之暫時救濟，目春令巳半，農忙轉瞬即屆，肥料之配給，即須着手。卽戽水機等，亦宜設法改燒木柴機。去年秋早，因機器戽水之缺乏，乾枯之禾田在在皆是。耕牛年來亦因來源絕迹，大見缺乏。凡此種種，若不早爲救濟，則不獨農作物不能增收，卽原有生產，亦將不能維持。</p>
<p>今年之農年，大槪情形，已如上述。政府當局固當加以注意，而擁有遊資之上海經濟界，亦望實行農村貸款，即廣購戽水機等以低價租於農民應用，亦未始非援助方法之一，希望切實進打，以奠定國家之經濟基礎。</p>

<h3>上海典押業之沿變</h3>
<p>— 陳熙臺</p>
<p>典當一業，不特是爲調劑貧民經濟而設，抑且爲社曾經濟機構之一，我國之有典當，不知創始於何一時代，筆者未暇有所考據，僅就管見所及，將近代典當業之概况，及上海數十年來當押業之沿變，約略分述如下。</p>
<p>開設當典，必需儲備巨資，以待物品之質押，故當典乃財物聚匯之所因之亦爲盜賊覬　之的，所以歷代相沿，一有變亂，當典則先受其殃。溯自淸季洪楊之亂，當典旣受災刦，自然不復存在，洎乎亂平，刦後餘生，滿目瘡痍，民生凋疲，地方有司爲調劑貧民，各處乃有公典之設立，當期規定三年爲滿，寬放四個月，月息一分二釐，其資本或由省庫指撥，或委由地方搢紳籌集，隨後治安較佳城市，方有民營當典設立，當期與公典相同，惟利息則多為一分五　，作鄉鎮　有民營代步），名為接典，期限雖與公典相同，惟在兩個月內，或六個月內，（此視資本之多寡而定）可向本接典取贖，逾期則娘向其指定之城中公典取贖，利息則按月二分，蓋接典資本不多，爲利民起見，公典准許商民在鄉鎭開設代步，故接典利息較高，並且允其於規定之月期，尙未取贖之貨，可以運至城中轉押於公典，在此一時期，當典不僅是受押衣物首飾，在鄉鎭且受押農具及農產品，諸如蠶絲，棉花，棉布等，斯則有類今日之銀行倉庫矣。迄於民國建元以後，則因變亂相尋，民營當典，又復裏足。諸如在此次中日事變以前，南京蘇州掦州鎭江等處當典，大多數仍屬官營，或者官助民營於此可知當典一業，關係社曾經濟之重要。　在上海則因有租界關係，當又作別論。在華界及租界，所有民營典當，及一切規章，則仍不脫公典窠臼，俱屬三年四個月滿期。利息則爲按月二分。惟因期限過長，在估値方面，則似甚低。例如以一元之當本，若經四十個月後滿期，加上利息計算，已需增爲一元八角以上。所以原値十元之物，僅可當二三元。而上海和界，又爲華洋雜處之所。一般勞働貧民，身無長物，更何有鉅値之物，可向當典押貸，因之租界上高利　之小押，應運而生。最初開設者，據說押物滿期，僅是一個月，以十日爲一期，按期利息三分。旋以營此業者日漸增多，同業含有競爭性質，乃將期限改爲兩個月，利息亦减爲每期二分。及後以工部局加以取締管理，復再改爲四倘月滿期。利息則在三元以下者，按期二分，三元以上按月三分，雖說期限甚短，利息甚高，但對貧民則稱利便，故小押常得以蒸蒸日上，以迄於今日。　在四十個月的當典，與四個月的押當之中，復又有一種質當介乎其中。其期限則訂爲十八個月滿貨。利息則與當典同爲按月二分。及晚近則改爲十二個月滿期。在法租界民國路上老北鬥口，有一家源順門前，迄今仍高懸質字招牌，即是此類質當之。</p>
<p>洎平民國以後，時勢變途愈速。更兼上海爲文明中心，繁華所在，競尙時髦。當典時限過長，所滿衣服，待至經過四十個月後，已成陳腐，乏人光顧。不得已而三十個月，二十四個月，逐漸至十八個月。最近且因物價之高漲，更由十二個月，而改爲八個月矣／在此過程中，押當則因典當縮短期限，當價提高，大剽當戶，多趨典當押貸，爲競爭營業起見，曾經由四個月，改放爲六個月，及八個月。幷訂大票當價超過五元以上者，利息按月二分計算。十元以上者，月息反較典當爲廉。有一分八厘者，有一分六厘者，甚至有一種大押當，期限亦訂十八個月，利息且减至按月一分四厘。以與典當互相競爭，自滬寗鐵路建築完成，通車之後，設立總車站於閘北。閘北市面，因之逐步繁盛。押當亦逐漸在閘北開設，隨後上海縣城拆除城牆，振興南市，押當亦隨之侵入，而不復爲典當獨市矣，但典當當價低，押當當價高，當戶押貸，每以押當稱便，故多趨之。因此在南市閘北華界之典當，羣起攻訐押當。於民國初年，呈訴江蘇省中管機關，指訴押當重利盤剝，損害貧民，請求取締。結果，旣已開業者，訂制章程，限制遵章准予領照常業。不準背后增開設，以資限制。因此南市方面，法華交界處，沿法租界馬路，押當之開設，星羅棋布，以迎南市之當戶，堪稱畸形現相。迨八一三事變爆發，不特華界閘北南市，即虹口地區，以及租界邊沿，均遭池魚之殃，相率遷入租界中民地區，擇地復業。以避難租界者眾多，人口稠密，典押業亦相當繁榮。無奈好景不常，拿自己的鈔票，代當戶看守貨物，貨價則扶搖直上，幣値則一再下貶，經不起當戶數次翻弄，更加代客贖當應運而生，三反四復，把典當押當的「架頂」，翻得幾乎空空如也。所以在新老幣交替的時候，典押業祗得相率止當。爲顧及夥友生計起見，一方面呈准工部局，縮小範圍，改短月期，增高利率，勉力支持。故典當由十二個月，改爲八僩月。押常由六個月，改為四個月。利息均增至按月六分。并月營業時間，因資本短拙，每日開業僅僅數小時而已。東夥雙方弄得頹神喪氣。一方面簡直斬釘截鐵的，收束營業，另尋出路。所以有今日南市之畸形繁榮矣。</p>
<p>在八一三事變時，租界地區，四週全部封閉。及戰事西移，上海附近各處雞民，麕集於南市難民區。因　界處封閉不通，日用所需，一有不繼，勢必携物繞道租界典質，頗費周折。此時遂有投機者，連絡日商爲背景，在難民區內，設立商行。專押當票，限期七天，寬放三天，共足十天，利息照押本加二計算。旋以營業頗吒，營此業者漸多，乃兼押現貨。依照日本押當規例，當期一個月，常票票面，亦照當本加二計數寫明，不另取息。（按照當本加二取見已寫明票面）及後一部分鐵門開放，始有極少數之押當，在難民區內復業。更以市政當局，力圖南市之復興，特劃南市爲娛樂區，由此押　日增月盛。但是南市請領押當執照，若照法定規則，則必須照八個月的期限，二分的月息，方准營業。至於戰後復業者，雖未呈准社會局，准許縮短月期，增高利息。在事實上，已是仿照租界的先例，在當票上印有附說「時値非常同業公議利息按月每元〇分暫定四個足月爲滿」字樣，以表明在此非常時期，幷未能遵照法定規則。此爲最近上海典押業之沿變概况也。</p>

<p>植物類移植能否成功是決定於氣候風土不同的條件。文化交流不消說是決定於各該民族的歷史的現實不同的條件。忽視了氣候風土之適應性去移植植物，就沒有將來一定圓滿的把握。同樣，忽視了各該民族的歷史的現實而談文化溝通，也是沒有把握。所以，要論中日文化溝通之先，必須對於中日兩國民族性和其所經歷的歷史，以及兩國國民現在所處的政治的經濟的生活的和其他一切的狀態加以深切的考慮。</p>
<p>離開日本民族的歷史的現實之日本文化是不會有的，同樣，遠離中國民族的歷史的現實之中國文化也不會存在的。雖然，世上論中日文化溝通的人，往往忘却了這件事實，這種人始終以爲有一種可以適用日本也可以適用中國的超過一切的文化。這是最大的錯覺。</p>
<p>政治獨立，經濟合作，軍事同盟，文化溝通，這四個標語，我以爲文化溝通和其餘政洽經濟軍事列在一起是很値得注目的。因爲文化問題是民族問題的一環，所以，中日文化溝通的問題必須出發於中日兩國民族的歷史的現實，才能够說明其他的一切。</p>
<p>近年來，中日兩國朝野對於中日文化溝通工作致力尤甚。中日文化協會的組織和各種事業的推行，林房雄氏與國內文化界之交歡等等，都是充分的表現。還有，據說日本的作家團體正在籌備於中國各地設立「文藝會館」而企圖兩國作家的交歡和刊行文藝雜誌等等。這些計劃都是很好的。不過，只靠請客造房子刊行雜誌等等，還是不能　到文化溝通的。我希望日本文學家對於中國的歷史的現實，必須有深刻的考察。</p>
<p>最近在日文大陸新報看見一篇林房雄草野心平陶昌孫張若谷等的文學座談會記錄，大意歸結起來，林房雄對於苦悶在現實之中國作家的現狀，似乎完全沒有理解。林房雄的話意是要求中國作家不要拘執政治和現實去另創一種超過這些現實的「純粹文學」—他非但不能理解中國的文學，就是對於一般文學的理解也很不可靠。</p>
<p>遠離了現實而能够創造文學，一定不可能的。</p>
<p>民族的歷史的現實，和這些空想都沒有關係在進行着。</p>
<p>我們有呻吟於高物價之下的老百姓，我們還有對於政治現狀感覺苦悶的智識階級，我們需要和他們共苦，而在此苦悶中去爭取光明的中國，這就是我們的文學。能够理解和同情我們這條行程的文學家，不問國籍，不問有名無名，都是我們的「文學之友」了。</p>
<p>林房雄民說：日本人苦二重而中國人苦四重，如果林先生想做中國文學之友的話，那末，希望對於此四重之苦，需要加以最深刻地理解，和反省</p>
<h3>第一次失眠</h3>
<p>— 方明</p>
<p>每晚米回兩次，這烟紙店門前的角隅，已成爲我每大必經之地，而且是很熟識的了。</p>
<p>在崎嶇不平，大小不一的方塊石拼成的人行道上，鋪着一條僅寥寥數根的蓆子，上面蜷伏着高高的一堆，頂着一塊碎亂的蔴袋布，像有節奏似地在聳動着，嗚咽着。對馬路一帶點心店裏斜射出來了黯淡的燈光，這一堆高聳的小丘似的怪物，更顯得陰森可怖。可怖的怪物也是每晚路過時使我注目的東西。</p>
<p>在某一個早一些的時候，同一的地方，兀坐着兩個年紀不相上下的七八歲的孩子，看來一個女的比較大一些。他們倆同樣的盤踞在那裏，呈露着兩雙烏煤似的手臂，將手揷在僅有的陂棉背心的懷中。他們的身軀抖動得很厲害，牙齒格格的作聲，迸發出斷斷續續的低弱的哼聲：</p>
<p>「……老闆小姐…救…救我……哪……凍死了……啊！……」</p>
<p>這聲音在我的耳邊也是很熟識了。但是這次却將我從急促的步子中拉回來，迫我對她們瞧一眼。我想多看些時候，並且想在袋角裏，掏出一兩張角票給她們。可是我不知我的袋角裏是否還有角票剩留，我只一方面時間又不允許我多逗留一分鐘，甚至一秒鐘，我只好對他們再投了分別的一眼離開了。在我再回頭對他們看時，他們也正注視着我，好像他們已明白了一切，又好像他們的心中正在暗地譏笑着我的吝嗇，而懷恨着我。</p>
<p>照例的另一個晚上，天色異常灰黯。我跑出門時却巧一陣劇烈的寒風迎面撲來，禁不住使我寒慄，將頭頸往裏一縮。跑到馬路上，才知道天還在飄着雪。沿路上的行人，都在喃喃地：「下雪囉！春天下雪可比冬天冷囉！」自語着。</p>
<p>烟紙店門前的角隅裏，小丘似的怪物依然存在，一起一伏的聳動着。點點的雪打在破蔴袋上，碎蓆子邊？發出低微的嗦嗦的響聲，夾着從蔴袋角邊發出來的單調的呻吟，空氣變得更加陰悽。</p>
<p>我習慣的瞥了一眼，跨大了步子走去。因急促的緣故，不時向行人碰撞。他們怨恨的駡聲由背後傳來，我祇得聽便</p>
<p>風呼呼地哮着，夜深的寒氣，格外這人。雪下得更大了，屋頂上和人行道上，已積起薄薄的一層，而尙在無窮盡地瀉下來。我冒着雪在歸途中掙扎，幾乎像刷上了一層白粉。跑鞋也濕透了，走時發出「尺浦尺浦」的聲音，脚指冷得發痛，手已不能動彈了。</p>
<p>尋愈下愈密了，眼前一片灰白。行和更稀少了，四週異常沉寂，祗有「刹剎剎剎」的單調的聲音，點綴道寂靜的氣氛</p>
<p>我俯着頭直向前走去，雜亂的思想時時佔據在腦海中。我不知不覺的已走過烟紙店的轉角。可是腦海中倐地突起了一種思緒，似有什麼東西遺忘了。我不自主地回轉身子，向烟紙店的轉角走回去。黯黝黝的角隅裏不再有高聳的小丘似的一堆，祇見全是一片白。我疑惑這怪物栘到什麽地方去了。可是待我走近看時，高出的一堆，依然還在，不過被雪埋掩得一時不能辨淸罷了。然而我又疑心　什麼沒有起伏，沒有聳動，而且再聽不到呻吟呢，難道他們睡着了嗎？可是睡着總不見得無聲無息的一動不動吧。於是我提起脚向這高堆輕輕地踢了一下。但它仍然毫無動靜。我突然感一陣恐怖，連忙回轉身子，提起了脚，直跑回宿舍。</p>
<p>我蒙着被頭躺着，恐怖的陰影，還在眼前幌現。</p>
<p>「這可憐的兩條小生命，就在白雪的遮蓋下消失了吧？」我想驅除這雜亂的思緒，可是不能。我强閉着眼睛，竭力使我睡去，可是又不能。我索性讓我想下去，讓我的思緒無窮盡地發展下去。</p>
<p>「他們爲什麽要受苦，……他們犯了什麽罪？……另有一般人不是在享樂嗎？……」</p>
<p>「世界大文豪高爾基，他在幼年時曾度過求乞，拾垃圾的生涯，誰能斷定這兩條已死的小生命，以及全上海全中國受到同樣遭遇的可憐虫，是絕對沒有天才的？……」</p>
<p>舍長室裏傳來了淸晣的噹噹的鈴聲，是點鐘了。繚繞的思緒始終估據着不肯退去。時而昏沉沉的糢糊了，時而高聳的小丘似的怪物，可憐的面影，以及微弱的呻吟，嘆息，……又復現在眼前。</p>
<p>我第一次失了眠。</p>
<h3>率真和應酬</h3>
<p>— 林華傑</p>
<p>不知道受了誰的一篇文章的影響，總覺得華筵散了，賓客去了，是一種頗爲悽凉的境界；而眞的夢想起不散的筵席來。</p>
<p>但是到了我的職業給了我一種幸運，一種可以常常去參加宴會的幸運時，我開始明白，我先前得到的那點觀念，是多麽的可笑。（人是應該在自己的生活中形成自己的情感，而不應該去接受別人在生活中得來的情感的啊！）</p>
<p>設想在杯觥交錯，賓主盡歡的筵席上，主人一面以風趣的口吻說着宴叙的目的，一面謙卑地請求包涵：菜肴是太菲薄了；而貴賓們，雖然吃着千金一席的盛筵，也都沒有忘記嘴巴還有另外一種用處，於是，座上談笑風生了。</p>
<p>如果，你並非僅是帶了一張嘴去，你眞不禁要驚訝，我們的賓主都是怎樣的淵博啊。話是一車又一車，從不知名的地方駛來，又駛向不知名的地方去。雖然往來自如，祇是話不離經：賭經，嫖經，生意經</p>
<p>可是，坐在席上的你，能說些什麼呢？你能以怎樣的話語，在這熱鬧的塲面上凑趣呢？逃？不行，你逃不掉；瞧，主人的話車正向你這站上急駛而來，你能讓這輛車子在你的站上出軌嗎說眞的，你缺少了那點勇氣，於是，你笑笑。</p>
<p>笑也是一種言語，一種有禮貌的言語。然而，常笑不是情感的流露，而成爲了一種言語的時候，你明白了笑的悲哀。而你的笑，正如人們稱呼那種宴會，是一種應酬。</p>
<p>以是我開始怕起宴會來，自然不是怕我的胃承受不了油膩；我是怕鏡子照出了我應酬的笑。自己得來的一份敎育，是頌揚率眞：而社會的現實却要你應酬！而這瞧酬的最終的代價，就是率眞的喪失。</p>
<p>（我們的各種各樣的「家，」却還在縱談讀書與做人，一個風馬牛不相關的　目。）</p>
<p>先生，我從學校裏出來剛剛一百七十四天，也許我看見的太少，我希望時間能讓我看見一點美麗。我更希望後來的人能看見一點美麗：（我們這社會期望於年輕人的可不少，而留給他們的却是那樣非薄！）</p>
<h3>擠與推</h3>
<p>— 凌慶年</p>
<p>「擠」是「擠進去」，「推」是「推出來」。方法是舊的，自古以來的例子就如草芥，俯拾即是。本草綱目中雖不曾將牠開列進去，作爲應世良方，孫子兵法中倒彷彿是有的。處於「江山代有賢人出，各領騷壇五百年」的今日，早已運用到熟極而流的境地。</p>
<p>此自非草野之夫可得而聞之的。但在都市的四郊，照「一齊傅之，衆楚人咻之」的話兒，要是也海派些起一些冒險英雄在商言商的念頭，挾一匹大雄雞，捆兩包金字塔，或幾塊老祥茂到那裏到這裏，那就比畎畝之中更要熟習些擠和推，否則便不免「賠了夫人又折兵」，算他不交運。</p>
<p>所以即使在都市中的交通工具也於擠與推中更走紅運起來。例如在電車上罷就和整個社會的閙哄哄一樣，要存在在這小型的社會中便非學全擠和推的本領不可。先是車站上要擠得一大排地，車還沒走近，一股人之洪流就往車身擁，於是車子不軋死人，人也得擠壞車子，車鬥前吊上好一大串。但人呢，並不向前，因爲前面也是人；也決不敢老等在踏板上休息五分鐘，原來後屁股也是人。有些人或許心廣體胖些，擠在左右的就使他難過，於是左右開弓，把肘子撞向人家的鼻子；或許脚下有點笨重，便把臂子攔住把手，來個全盤統制，不讓人往前　。</p>
<p>有時候還屛上十幾秒鐘，在車門口人祇向左右動，車廂裏還空空如也。賣票的眞有職業病，祖宗三代都交代淸楚，鐵門上還掛着二三個，車巳開動了。於是下面抱着不立乎巖牆之下的古訓的英雄們，可以發議論了：「猪玀，可是救命車？」</p>
<p>但有機會擠上第三或四部救命車之後，要是賣票遺不肯拉鐵門，上述的英雄就會喊要擠死了——這正表明他已在努力地「推」。他們拚命搶角坐，不行！就把人推開，但人家的屁股靈活，自己的尊臀却又漫不在乎壓着人家的膝蓋；可是旁座者爲避免侵佔起見，可用手一椎，把自己身子轉成四十五度，脚蹺起來，抽上一支烟。</p>
<p>於是又是一個英雄被擠了出來。他只好侷處一隅，還不失破口大駡的發　權。全車廂就格外被擠和推得厲害。到了站頭，勝利者又一擠而下踏板，旁邊那個英雄就分外眼紅，於是冷冷地一推。</p>
<p>被推於車輪之下。——這就是擠與推的社會新聞資料之一。普通得很。</p>
<p>「必求壟斷而登之，以左右望而罔市利，人皆以爲賤，故從而征之。」誰叫他坐電車，木炭或三輪車使不至給「擠進去」和「推出來」。此之　　民。</p>
<p>古之君子，可就不會那樣擠與推得難看。　揖讓代替了窮兇極惡，雖然也能「擠進去」，結果却還給「推上來」。像陳橋兵變的宋太祖便是歷史上的典型人物，羅馬凱撤也是最聰明不過的。我想，與其「推出來」，倒不如屬於「推上來」的有趣，而且不失溫柔教厚之風。</p>
<p>譬如在目前，「跑市塲」就是「擠進去」，「早打烊「則決不是把顧客硬」「推出來」之謂，結果都使囤貨之價「推上來」—今之君子也不失溫柔敦厚，可以讓他們列入賤民之外。</p>
<h3>無題</h3>
<p>— 洛沁</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>我苦守在寂寞的斗室裏，</p>
<p>煩惱地聆着無情的鐘聲，</p>
<p>計算着歲月底逝去。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>用沉重的跛足，數着崎嶇的石級，艱難地向上爬——這是爲着夢呀！</p>
<p>「啊，是多麼削的山道呀！」我苦難地仰視——</p>
<p>掠過下意識的思索，希望似乎被山風帶走了。</p>
<p>我懊喪地低下頭——感到我是受騙啦！</p>
<p>「休息一下吧！」看着道邊底石櫈。</p>
<p>望望前面遙長的行程，眼邊有點潮濕，可是，誰會知道呢：——</p>
<p>在這空虛的山野，有個旅人在啜泣。</p>
<p>「這是人生的歷程呀！勇敢一下，向前去吧！」山風在我耳邊低語。</p>
<p>我蠢笨地動一動跛足。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>夢是甜的，生活是苦的。</p>
<p>以往像奔馳過的雲塊——</p>
<p>沒有甚麼可追念。</p>
<h3>「杞憂」—劇壇的新危機</h3>
<p>— 孟朗</p>
<p>因爲愛好劇藝的緣故，凡有演出必往觀賞，數年從未間斷，這也可說是一個戲劇的老觀衆了。但是年來觀劇的印象，越來越平淡，甚至興味索然！——我想這並不是個人的興趣問題。</p>
<p>戲劇演出表面上的繁榮和熱鬧，能否說明它的本質的自然發展？劇藝水準的日趨低落，這是鐵一般的事實。爲了太愛好它的緣故，謹將觀感所得，略陳於后，聊供從事劇藝工作者的參閱：—聲明在前，這僅是一個觀衆的觀感，是與否還得質諸劇壇的前輩！</p>
<p>開劇第一主義</p>
<p>其實，這是一句老生常談的話，不過現在死灰復燃，益發白熱化罷了。主要，我想這是基於商業上的要求：什麽類　的戲觀衆最歡迎？這當然是劇團企業化後的先決問題。於是適應這要求，劇作家大都屈尊就　，放棄了他們的「人生派」或「藝兩派」的固守的主見，羣趨」鬧劇（Meloderama）的一條路上走去，因寫祇有這玩意兒：情節曲折，劇情熱鬧，苦　苦個痛快，死—死個精光，不求合理，　間個性。觀衆看了夠刺激，好在他們跑來求享受或發洩；自己寫起來也方便，祇要竭盡「出奇一和「噱頭一的能事！</p>
<p>試讀各劇團的演出特刋，作者不是自己吹捧一番，就是罪言自己招在前頭，所謂「無巧不成書」，僅圖混口「百家飯」；可憐，他們竟自動褪下那塊神聖不可侵犯的尊嚴的招牌！更有美其名曰「驚布劇」「傳奇劇」或「……」。豈知這種荒膠的無原則的「鬧劇第一主義」，不僅斷送了劇　的光榮的史跡，阻碍了演出和演技的進步，使中國戲劇團隨入萬刦不復的深淵，　接祗有等而下之，不會再向上發展一步；同時可能得到「爭取觀衆」的反而—趕走眞正　心擁護它的羣衆，因之，作爲一個欣賞劇藝的觀衆，今後要想看一　有意義的眞正的悲劇或喜劇，恐怕也將不可能了！</p>
<p>演出「雜耍化」</p>
<p>年來，劇人們確是進步了，懂得覜眾心理，能投其所好。導演們也不甘示弱，建立了他們的特殊的功跡，這就是：演出「雜耍化」。安得列夫的名著里，居然出現了一段河南雜耍，來無踪去無影，　得觀衆一些愚蠢的哄笑！其間，還穿串些什豳象舞，牛舞，馬舞——純好來塢電影的無聊的噱頭。最近，話劇里揷京劇，似乎成了最時髦的玩意兒：於是淸唱，揷科打諢，鑼鼓塲面，彩排串戲……甚至連夫子廟里的繁芳會偶都搬上了舞台，興之所至，再加上這麼一段崑曲或大鼓，如果他們想到申曲或紹興戲，又何嘗安揷不上？我想信不久的將來，連科天影的魔術，鄧××的絕技，何什麽的扯鈴；獨脚戲，口技，或草裙舞等，都有搬上舞台的可能；這樣，觀衆化了一次代價，看了許多有興味的雜耍，豈不比上游戲塲還更便宜，經濟！</p>
<p>有人要聲辯：戲中揷　要，是爲了劇情所需，或是增加空氣，顯示背景，表達劇中人的身份，職業，嗜好……！但是請負責演出的導演們，憑着藝衛良心靜靜地想想看：是否完全爲了這些，並沒有絲毫越分的企圖——迎合觀衆的低級趣味：凑熱鬧，要花槍？</p>
<p>我並不反對戲中應有的穿揷，因爲那是合理的，對戲的本身是有有機的作用的。我所担心者，這種「雜耍化的演出，它會破壞整個演出上情調和氣氛的統一性與和諧性，甚至可以唁賓奪主，以雜耍來代替戲劇本身的藝術生命。——但願我是杞憂，因爲這是常識以下的事，對於劇藝供有正確認識和豐富修養的戲劇導演者，當然胸有成竹，必不至於如此的墮落和卑下！</p>
<p>看「人」不看「戲」</p>
<p>最近，新興的話劇也部分地染上了舊劇的惡劣的傳統的毒：看「人」不看「戲」。觀衆常常爲了看某某演員，才去看他或她所演的戲，如果這天不是他或她本人演，甚至就要鬧退票。這種現象的產生，也許因爲某某演員的演技精湛或演戲認眞，以致博得了千萬觀衆的好感，自然地對他或她發生了信仰和欽佩。但是事實也不盡然，「綠×的文明戲觀衆也常有類此的事件發生，這難道也是文明戲演員的藝衛成功？不，這有它存在的原因。，明星制或說台柱制在作祟！</p>
<p>中國新興的話劇，雖僅短短的三十年的歷史，却一向保持着它的優良的傳統：這兒沒有台柱，也沒有明星的出現，戲無主角與配角之分，大家都是參加演出的一份子，因爲它是綜合藝術，與舊劇有本質上的不同，它是一種集體創造的有機體。可是當它落入「金錢至上」的商人手掌，情形轉變了，老闆們爲了賣座，於是拚命地捧出幾個明星來吸引觀衆——和用他們的盲目的偶像崇拜。即以最前進的劇團而論，亦在大量地製造明星，至少，正在助畏明星制度的成長，主角公然抽演員稅，即是一例。同時，演員本身的風頭主義，著文吹噓，想藉梅蘭芳程硯秋之流，奠定他們自己的地位，也時常有，他們想，最好爬上明星寳座，從此名利雙收！</p>
<p>上述諸傾向的繼續發展，戲劇藝術將整個地被支解，失去它固有本質的光榮特色，將重蹈文明戲的可怕的覆轍，如果不用塗上幾句對白的劇本而用幕表制，這與文明戲又有什麽異樣？至於內容的意識，它已經非常薄弱！所以，作爲一個關心它的觀衆，爲了它前途的發展正在深深地担憂！旣然對到一些隱伏着的危機，也就不嫌掃興地率直地說了出來，好在這是一個觀衆偶得的觀感，是與否，我再說，還得質諸劇壇的前輩！</p>
<h3>期望　—獻給白茅文藝週刊</h3>
<p>— 㕳吁</p>
<p>在這個時候，申報闢出一個文藝副刊來，也許有人視爲是多餘；在這個時候讓我對文藝來懷上點期望，更也許有人瞧爲「　大；然而我有感於「白茅」徵稿啓事上所說的「文藝之於時代關係重要」的話，就不免有些感既想說了。</p>
<p>文藝是文學部門的一個分野，同時也是藝術部門的一種，這是無人可以否認的！因爲她綜合了文字，思索，寫作，等的幾種功夫而成。在藝術的園地上她同樣是種表現社會形象，促使社會進步的重要文化工具，因此有人說：文藝是匕首，文藝是一面鏡子，是的，她表現的，是社會的現實，她所刺截針砭的，也正是現社會的陰暗面，要求社會的光明進步，我們是決不應忽視這面鏡子的使用的！</p>
<p>但在這裏我們覺得萬分遺憾的，是文藝的效騐，至今還不過只保留在其本身表層而已，檢視這許多年來的經歷與陳因，主要的還不是由了一般人對文藝本質的誤解所致嗎？</p>
<p>譬如在最早的一個時期，文藝的表現，似乎只被局限在風，花，雪，月之間，而用以表現的人們，又多　傲雅意，以爲文藝的功效，不過是戲弄筆墨，供自己欣賞歡娛而已；這樣的觀念傳到後來，把文藝的身價便無形中抬至天際雲空一般了！大多以文藝是不染　俗，淸雅高貴一類階級中人所專有的藝術品，「五四」以來，這種專有的風習，似乎稍稍受到打擊了！但換站的却像是一般文人學士之類了，文藝的形式上，是解放了一層樊籠，但畢竟一層而已，使用的權利，仍被少數學士們佔有着，沿而至今，給他仍做升官發財，拍馬表功的手段還不算，甚至描形繪色，以女性爲對象，以女事爲影印，直接是表示了此時此地的文藝舞弄者們的墮落無涯：但間接對社會對治安上實造成了更多風化罪惡，言念及此，我們當不禁爲文藝呼寃！</p>
<p>爲適應時代的需要，我們嚴格地要求正常健全的文藝的出現是非常正當的！因此我對白茅的期望是這樣的：</p>
<p>一，當然不應爲一此風雅色性的作品的出現之所，而是表現確鑿現實；適應時代的新文藝園地。</p>
<p>二，取稿廣泛，水準不要限於太高，使她做到通俗普遍的宗旨。</p>
<p>三，儘量接受各方面的意見和投稿，我們不忘記「文藝是　於大衆的！」</p>
<p>四，據此，我們歡忭白茅的創刋，同時引望她的發展滋榮，爲今後文藝界闢一新面目！</p>

<h3>Improving Local Grassroots Politics</h3>
<p>Since the new year, to adapt to the needs of the new situation after participating in the war, both the central political and local political institutions of our country have been improved. However, it seems that there is also a need for thorough improvement of local grassroots politics. This is because the grassroots organizations of local politics, namely the political institutions in villages and towns below the county level, are the source of all national policies. If a certain level is not sound, it will greatly hinder the implementation of national policies. Moreover, if the politics at the township and even county levels can be actively improved, the foundation for national construction after the war can also be laid.</p>
<p>In improving grassroots politics, "systems" and "talents" are equally important, but under the current actual situation, the strict selection and appointment of talents is particularly important. In principle, local grassroots politics should first implement autonomy, so that outstanding individuals among the people can directly participate in politics. Although the Baojia system is a relatively primitive form of autonomy, if it can be reformed appropriately based on new political theories, with reference to the local political systems of contemporary powerful countries, and after considering the special circumstances of various parts of our country, it may not be impossible to make it an initial form of autonomy, and then realize the local rule of modern countries. Of course, in some areas today, peace has not yet been restored, and some areas are still under military control, but generally speaking, the vast areas along the coast, the Yangtze River, and even North China no longer have special conditions. Preliminary "local autonomy" has the possibility of being implemented, so that the strength of the people can be concentrated under national policies, and the reality of comprehensive simplification of administration can be achieved. In particular, talents for local autonomy should be cultivated immediately and extensively to meet the increasingly urgent needs of various parts of the country in the future.</p>
<p>The fundamental reason for the unsoundness of local grassroots politics in the past is the lack of political training and political experience of the general public. Oppressed by thousands of years of autocratic politics, they only have passive political beliefs and lack active political ethics. Most citizens can only take care of themselves and cannot work together to benefit the community. Therefore, if we want to improve grassroots politics today, we must start with cultivating the active political morality of the people, so that everyone can consciously and automatically engage in the cause of benefiting the local community and serving the country. The key points of this kind of cultivation work, or local political tutelage work, must first focus on the two major problems of the past: the control of local bullies and gentry and the lack of political construction talents. Efforts should be made to cultivate construction talents, so that fair and virtuous people can come out to govern. As for the cultivation of talents, the fundamental countermeasure is for the government to establish special local political cadre schools, and to set up civil administration or local administration classes in the political science departments of various national universities, to train graduates from high schools and above, so that they can become cadres for local grassroots politics in the future. Those with the best performance should be given a trial period as township chiefs, and then gradually promoted, and it should be stipulated that in the future, those who have not served as township chiefs and have achieved results should not be appointed as county magistrates. In the future, when autonomy is implemented and township and county magistrates are elected by the people, this can also be used as a qualification to restrict candidates. Because the power of local bullies and gentry has long been deeply rooted in the local area, unless new people are thoroughly appointed and new policies are implemented, it will never be possible to improve local autonomy and promote genuine autonomy.</p>
<p>Although today's local grassroots politics cannot be said to be completely disconnected from provincial and central politics, the existence of its bad phenomena is an undeniable fact. On a large scale, it is enough to hinder the implementation of national policies, and on a small scale, it also makes local people with lofty ideals disdain to engage in local politics. Since talents are unwilling to go to villages and towns, grassroots politics will never improve. Therefore, we hope that the government will enrich the political institutions of villages and towns, clearly define their political tasks, first connect the politics of villages and towns with that of counties, and further seek to professionalize the duties of village and town and county magistrates, respect their positions, improve their treatment, and strictly examine their performance, so that many talents in the country will be willing to engage in local autonomy. Then, use political power to eliminate local bullies and support fair and virtuous people, implement political training for the people, so that the general public can be sure that politics is closely related to their daily lives, and they will not easily give up their rights. Then, it will be possible to improve today's local grassroots politics and facilitate the mobilization of people's power. Then, total war participation can be thoroughly realized. And it will be of great help to the construction of a new China after the war.</p>
<p>Translation and Discussion</p>
<h3>Progress in Japanese-Vietnamese Cooperation</h3>
<p>The Japan-Vietnam Trade Implementation Agreement was completed this year. On the 4th, the Governor-General and Ambassador Kuriyama, the Director-General of Administration, completed the signing in Hanoi. At the same time, regarding the existing treaties between Japan and Vietnam, such as Vietnam's current regulations, tariff and trade agreements, and residence and navigation treaties, etc., discussions will be held on those that may hinder economic exchange between Japan and Vietnam, in order to seek improvement and application. As a result, Vietnam, standing as a member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, expressed its most frank goodwill. On the simplification of procedures for Japanese residents to enter the country and the prohibition of foreigners from engaging in occupations such as doctors, Japanese language teachers, trade agents, printing and publishing industries, etc., only Japanese residents will be permitted if they are beneficial to Vietnam's economy and culture. Other understandings were reached, such as easing restrictions on Japanese use, equal treatment for Japanese and Vietnamese in enterprises, and granting various facilities and concessions necessary for the conduct of war, and fair allocation of the ratio of imports and exports of Japanese merchant ships, so that the application and interpretation of current regulations and treaties are favorable to Japan.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Joint Defense Agreement this year, the relationship between Japan and Vietnam has undergone a leap forward improvement. At that time, the situation in France itself, after Marshal Petain came to power, established the fundamental policy of cooperation with the Axis powers. Thus, the complex political situation was reflected in the internal situation of Vietnam and showed various fluctuations. The agitation of the Tergol faction and the incomplete severance of relations with Britain and the United States caused Vietnam to be subject to many external constraints in becoming a member of the New East Asia, and its position was extremely difficult. Today, after a year and a half of the Greater East Asia War, thanks to Japan's war results, external constraints have been swept away, and the domestic political situation has become stable. Therefore, Vietnam does not need to worry about internal and external affairs, all obstacles have been removed, and it has finally become a cooperator in the construction of the Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Japan's policy of cooperation with Vietnam, of course, also increases its obligations to that country. Originally, the focus of France's policy towards Vietnam was to make Vietnam its own market. Therefore, Vietnam has not yet seen the emergence of modern industries. Exports are mainly agricultural products, and imports from overseas are mainly textile products and other daily necessities to adjust the country's economy. Now, the channel of exchange with the home country has been cut off, and all imports and exports cannot but depend on Japan. Last year, the export of Japanese processed products to Vietnam was sufficient to meet internal needs and more, and many were stored up. Therefore, it is believed that it is not necessary to implement the agreement in accordance with the agreed quantity. Because the stored materials have their limits, it is feared that Japan will not need to supply all the processed products needed by Vietnam this year. This quantitative agreement has been fulfilled almost completely. In view of Vietnam's cooperative attitude, Japan has plenty of room for maneuver in exporting materials, which goes without saying. Based on such mutual cooperation, the economic cycle that is generated will not only make Vietnam's export capacity to Japan increasingly strong, but also make its trust in Japan a cornerstone for the construction of the Greater East Asia.

<p>Hankou, Central News Agency, 13th – After the Japanese army made a surprise landing on the Yujun's key point Ouchikou on the south bank of the Yangtze River, the Yujun in that area has been defeated. The retreat route of the remnants of the 137th Regiment and the 129th Regiment of the 43rd Division of the Yujun was blocked by the Yufang battle team, so they returned to Wuzui, 12 kilometers northwest of Ouchikou, at dawn on the 12th and continued to resist stubbornly. However, they were eventually unable to resist and abandoned mortars and machine guns, etc., and fled in all directions. More than 100 people below the battalion commander were captured by the Japanese army, and 404 were killed in battle. The Yujun is now on the verge of complete annihilation.</p>

<p>(Central News Agency, Shanghai) According to a telegram from Guilin, the Japanese air force raided Guilin on the morning of the 12th and bombed the Yongfuliang area south of the city.</p>
<h3>Fire in Shaowu</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, Central News Agency, 13th – According to a telegram from Chongqing, Shaowu, a key point on the border between Fujian and Jiangxi, recently suffered a major fire. The intensity of the fire was the worst in the past 50 years. The entire city has almost been reduced to ashes.</p>
<h3>Li Wenli of Yu Xuezhong's Troops Leads His Troops to Surrender</h3>
<p>Qingdao, Central News Agency, 13th – Li Wenli, the former commander of the Second Column of Jie Jin in the Yufang, decided to lead his troops to surrender to the National Government because he realized that the war of resistance was wrong. It is now learned that the unit will hold a surrender ceremony soon. After the former Commander Li was captured, his subordinates also showed signs of wavering. In order to show their consistent support for Commander Li, those above the regimental commander jointly asked the Japanese army commander, saying that if Commander Li wanted to surrender to the National Government, we, all the officers and soldiers, would swear to take the same action as Commander Li. Commander Li was moved by the loyalty and support of his subordinates, so he decided to lead his troops to revolt. According to reports, Wu Huawen, General Li Yingping, and the troops of Commander Li have already surrendered to the National Government. The Yujun troops of Yu Xuezhong have been reduced by 70,000, and the strength of his remaining 114th Division is extremely weak, so its collapse must be near.</p>
<h3>Yu Overseas Chinese Committee Decides to Mobilize Overseas Chinese Case</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, Central News Agency, 13th – After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Yufang discussed overseas Chinese countermeasures and plans to mobilize overseas Chinese to return to the country. According to a telegram from Yu, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee recently decided on the Overseas Chinese Mobilization Case, the content of which is divided into four parts: human resources, finance, materials, and culture. After investigating and registering the skills that each overseas Chinese is proficient in, they will be put on standby for requisition. If there are no suitable jobs, they will serve in the military. As for financial mobilization, it is to encourage overseas Chinese savings, digest public bonds, and invest in charitable foundations. The vehicle for mobilizing materials is still to increase the productivity of overseas Chinese. Cultural mobilization stipulates the popularization of art and culture adapted to the Three Principles of the People, and promotes the general mobilization law and the necessary sciences for national defense construction, as well as cultural publishing activities in the Japanese-occupied areas of Nanyang, and promotes foreign relations. In short, it is nothing more than borrowing the name of the war of resistance to exploit the human and material resources of overseas Chinese.</p>

<h3>Japanese General Headquarters Announces Major War Results Achieved by Air Force Destroyed a Total of Thirty-Two Enemy Planes Sank and Heavily Damaged One Enemy Ship Each</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Dōmei News Agency, 13th – The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 11 am today that the Japanese side had shot down 32 enemy planes in operations in New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and the Aleutians, and had sunk and heavily damaged one enemy transport ship each. The communiqué is as follows: (1) The Imperial Navy Air Force sank an enemy transport ship of 3,000 tons in the eastern district of New Guinea on March 8 and heavily damaged another enemy ship. (2) Sixty enemy planes attacked a certain Japanese air base in the Solomon Islands on March 11. Eleven were shot down by anti-aircraft guns of the Imperial Navy. The Japanese side suffered minor losses. (3) Japanese naval aircraft attacked a certain enemy air base in eastern New Guinea on March 11 and shot down 18 enemy fighters that attempted to intercept. The Japanese side lost two aircraft, both of which crashed into enemy targets. (4) On March 11, 30 enemy planes attacked Narukami Island (Kiska Island) in the Aleutian Islands. Three were shot down by Japanese anti-aircraft guns. The remaining enemy planes were driven away. The Japanese side suffered minor losses.</p>
<p>Lisbon, Central News Agency, 13th – According to a telegram from San Francisco, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Forces Headquarters announced on the 12th that the Japanese Air Force bombed eastern New Guinea on the morning of the 7th.</p>
<p>Tokyo, Dōmei News Agency, 13th – People close to the Navy recently stated that the war results announced this morning by the Japanese side on March 8, 10, and 11 in eastern New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and off Narukami Island have proven with facts that enemy aircraft, warships, and transport ships that dare to enter the Japanese army's attack range will inevitably be severely attacked by the Japanese army. In the short period from March 1 to 5, the Japanese army shot down or destroyed 124 enemy planes in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, and sank four enemy submarines. This shows how closely the Japanese army is operating in these areas, and how urgent the enemy is trying to maintain its position. The Japanese side is constantly intensifying its attacks in the south and north in order to defeat the enemy. On March 8, enemy ships appeared in eastern New Guinea, aiming to transport war equipment and military rations to that area. The Japanese Navy Air Force detected the enemy's actions and immediately launched an attack, sinking a 3,000-ton transport ship and damaging another. Some time ago, the Japanese side lost five transport ships, which is true, but the war results announced this morning show that once the enemy enters the Japanese air force's attack range, it cannot move freely. The recent situation in the Southwest Pacific has clearly revealed the difficulties the enemy is currently encountering. The Japanese side's operational plan is to strengthen its air power in order to cut off the enemy's supply line and bomb the enemy's outposts until the enemy runs out of ammunition and food and finally surrenders. On March 10, 60 enemy air force planes attacked the Japanese base in the Solomon Islands, and 11 were shot down by the Japanese side's fierce anti-aircraft fire, which proves how strong the Japanese side's land defenses are in these areas. The fact that the enemy sent a large number of 60 planes to attack the Japanese base shows the enemy's desperate defense of its position on Guadalcanal Island. It also confirms that the enemy is extremely afraid that Guadalcanal Island will be isolated. The reason why the Japanese side is increasing its troop strength in this area is to concentrate air strikes on Guadalcanal Island. When the Japanese air force attacked New Guinea on March 1, enemy planes took off to challenge, and a total of 18 were shot down, including 12 Lockheed P-38 fighters and 6 P-39 Bell fighters. These war results show that the Japanese side is prepared to meet any enemy attacks head-on. On the same day, 30 enemy planes attacked Narukami Island, and Japanese anti-aircraft guns shot down three of them. All these war results show that Japan is not only strengthening its air force in the south, but also in the north. Soon, Japan will use its formidable air force to defeat the enemy in both the north and the south.</p>

<h3>German Mechanized Units Rush into Kharkov City Center; Soviet Pressure in Orel Region Weakened; New German Offensive Launched in Kursk Region</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 13th (Domei News Agency) – Berlin officially announced last night that German troops, after a fierce attack by mechanized units, have reached Red Square in the center of Kharkov. They now occupy the western, northern, and central parts of the city, up to Red Square. Simultaneously, German forces have advanced 25 miles north of Kharkov and are coordinating with German columns advancing from the Sumy and Akhtyrka (northwest of Kharkov) areas, attempting to encircle Soviet forces west of Valky. According to a Reuters correspondent in Moscow last night, Soviet forces in Kharkov are currently facing a difficult situation, with German forces constantly attacking at various points along the semi-circular front line, seeking to identify weaknesses in the Soviet defenses. This German counter-offensive is only part of the intensified resistance of the German forces on the Eastern Front. The German side has deployed numerous infantry divisions, supported by 900 tanks and large formations of aircraft, launching a fierce attack on Kharkov from the southwest. The Soviet forces, facing this intense assault on a very narrow front, may have retreated to a new line of defense. According to the German official news agency, in the past two weeks, German forces have destroyed three Soviet armies southeast, southwest, and south of Kharkov, and have cut off Soviet road and rail communications from all directions except the northeast. Only then were they able to enter Kharkov. Soviet pressure in the northern Orel region has weakened, and the new German counter-offensive in the Kursk region is also progressing rapidly, although details are not yet known. On the central front, the German High Command continues to carry out systematic operations in accordance with pre-determined plans, aimed at shortening the German line. On Thursday, they withdrew from Vyazma, about 140 miles west of Moscow. The Soviet Information Bureau issued a special communiqué last night, announcing the occupation of Vyazma.</p>
<p>German Forces Continue to Shorten Lines, Withdraw from Nep River Bulge</p>
<p>Somewhere in the Soviet Union, 13th (Havas News Agency) – In the past 24 hours, the fighting on the Eastern Front has been focused on Kharkov. It seems to be only a matter of time before German forces completely reoccupy the city. Moscow Radio also acknowledged fierce fighting near the city, and the Red Army is facing increasingly difficult circumstances. German aircraft and tanks have gained an advantage in that area, and fresh troops are constantly joining the battle. Moscow Radio also stated that this situation is only temporary, and that the German counter-offensive in the Kharkov area is only a manifestation of the general increase in German combat power. As for Vyazma, the Red Army continues to advance south of Bely and west of Sychyovka, while German forces continue to shorten their lines, apparently planning to completely withdraw from the Nep River's upstream bulge.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Eden to Visit the US to Exchange Views on the War Situation; In Addition to Meeting with Key US Government Officials, He Will Also Meet with Soviet Ambassador Litvinov</h3>

<h3>Medan Celebrates the First Anniversary of its Restoration; Four Sultans of Sumatra Visit Japanese Army Hospital</h3>

<h3>French Commentary Praises Japanese Military Achievements</h3>
<p>Saigon, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – Political commentator Emare published an article on Japanese Army Day, stating that the French have more than a hundred glorious war histories, and therefore deeply admire the glorious military achievements of Japan. We often encounter Japanese soldiers on the streets of Saigon and find that their discipline is strict and that they are models for soldiers.</p>
<h3>Wartime Production Configuration in Japan (II) – A Visit to the Kanegafuchi Metal Industries’ Puhara Factory: Working Day and Night Without a Moment's Rest</h3>
<p>We went to visit the Kanegafuchi Metal Industries Co., Ltd. factory in the Puhara area of the Tokaido, not far from Mount Fuji, which is touted as a paragon of Japanese scientific production. The factory was founded in Showa 14 (1939 in the Republic of China calendar). Although its history is not particularly old, the history of Japan’s Kanegafuchi Metal Industries itself is still quite new. Actual production is said to have begun around Showa 9, so the factory's history cannot be considered new. The environment here is stunning. Looking up, there is Mount Fuji; looking to the right, there is Suruga Bay; and on the left, there is a continuous range of mountains. The scenery is truly outstanding. Moreover, more than 100,000 tsubo (translator's note: one tsubo is approximately six square feet) of flat land stretches out before your eyes. This is probably because the large-scale production of Kanegafuchi metal requires maritime transport, a vast flat foundation, and mountains for easy power generation, so the factory was established here.</p>
<p>We first met with the factory director, Mr. Hideharu Takeda, and the engineering section chief, Mr. Hiroshi Kagawa. The factory directly produces aluminum from Kanegafuchi metal raw ore, and not through the production of foreign materials. Aluminum is used today in many daily necessities, telecommunications, telephones, transportation, and especially military supplies. It can be called the mother of culture and the darling of the age, with a relationship that cannot be separated from the demands of the times. Recently, in the decision to increase production, it has been specifically designated as a super-priority industry, and is therefore being produced day and night. Recently, it has caused the United States to shift from a battleship-first doctrine to an air power-first doctrine. The important aircraft materials are mostly a type of aluminum. This one fact alone should make us greatly concerned about it.</p>
<p>Bauxite, transported from the south, is first processed to make alumina. This substance is chemically called aluminum oxide, and is formed by the strong combination of oxygen and aluminum. By processing it further, aluminum can be made. However, this requires a great deal of electricity. Therefore, the amount and quality of the product will vary in price depending on how the electricity is obtained and used. This is why it is necessary to have a special scientific organization for the production of Kanegafuchi metal.</p>
<p>Mr. Takeda, Mr. Kagawa, Mr. Ishikawa, and I drove around the vast factory grounds. First, we went to see the port used for maritime transport. The waves of the coast are turbulent, and the wind and waves are fierce, but the wharf has been completed to eighty percent using special methods. For now, let's avoid the detailed report and say briefly that the scale of this wharf is too large to be considered just an engineering project belonging to a company's factory. From here, looking at the factory, we can see towering chimneys, several long, rectangular, tall factories, and several aqueducts running from the top of the mountain to the power plant. The grandeur of these structures, no matter how outstanding they are, all display the majesty of modern science. It is truly spectacular.</p>
<p>Next, we went to see the electrolytic workshops, which are the main part of the factory's production. In this towering factory building, more than twenty electrolytic flat furnaces are set up vertically. Because electrical processing is underway, the field has become smoky, and alumina powder is scattered in some places. People wearing masks to protect against the fire are holding stirring rods and stirring back and forth. The roaring flames and the gurgling sound of the crane make the field mystical, presenting a solemn scene. Each electrolytic furnace is a flat furnace of about fifteen feet, built with carbon-coated refractory bricks, and a carbon anode rod is suspended on the top. Several people form a group to manage several furnaces, with class leaders, squad leaders, and group leaders, each doing their best in production.</p>
<p>Cryolite is placed in the furnace for use as a solvent, and alumina is added to it and mixed. When a strong current is applied, the alumina decomposes, and the strongly combined gas and aluminum separate. Compared with other fire operations, the difficulty of this operation is not simply waiting for the metal to dissolve before processing, as in other refining processes. Instead, the workers must endure the high heat of 1,000 to 1,500 degrees Celsius, and continuously stir the ore in the furnace with a special stirring rod, continuously putting alumina into the furnace to liquefy it and promote the decomposition of oxygen and aluminum. Because this operation must be carried out under high heat, special consideration is given to physical strength, and masks and body masks are often worn during operation, but even in summer, several people inevitably faint. Factory Director Takeda believes that in order to fully carry out this difficult operation, there must be understanding between superiors and subordinates. Based on this idea, people who serve in the factory, regardless of their duties, must spend six months to two years in the factory to experience this work.</p>
<p>The commander of the factory's employees, Director Kobayashi, expressed his gratitude for the company's rational management and told us: "We all deeply know the importance of aluminum in this Greater East Asia War. We all hope to produce more one kan (translator's note: two kan is approximately one hundred taels in China) of aluminum, so that we can build more aircraft. Here, there is no rest for 365 days a year, and it is rotated day and night. No one has thought about taking a break during the Mid-Autumn Festival or the New Year, and everyone is working hard. Please pass this situation on to the outside world!" At this time, I didn’t know how to answer, so I could only lower my head and think silently.</p>
<p>The crane hanging on the ceiling constantly made a gurgling sound, lifting the liquefied aluminum and transporting it to the refining site, where it was transported by the machines waiting below to the refining site. The refining site is equipped with excellent Swiss-made refining furnaces, which are used to further refine and purify the transported aluminum, and then pour it into the designated molds to form blocks of aluminum.</p>
<p>Finally, we went to see the heart of aluminum production, the power rectification site. It was the exact opposite of the factories we had seen before, it was such a quiet and beautiful place, and it was completely a model of an orderly scientific organization. The power, which is the source of the factory's activities, is all controlled, adjusted, and generated here. Inside, there are more than twenty sets of equipment used to convert alternating current with a voltage of 60,000 volts into direct current. These equipments are said to be worthy of the world, but we feel unspeakable hope and greatness.</p>
<p>Factory Director Takeda said: "Since the establishment of the factory, I have been working hard with all my heart and soul. I have spent a lot of effort to guide the employees in the factory. At first, the local people were unwilling to work seriously and were unwilling to do their best, but the local people originally had the energy to plant tangerine trees on the endless slopes and mountains. Therefore, as long as they understand the meaning of the work in the factory, they will be willing to work hard, so the factory has achieved today's results." This is his noble business experience.</p>
<p>In order to win the final victory in the Greater East Asia War, we feel that the necessary production in today's life, no matter what, must make increasing production the first priority. This is true for any factory. However, regarding the hard work of material production, not to mention mines, not to mention steelmaking and ironmaking, especially in the production of aluminum, it cannot be understood without witnessing it, and there is unspeakable hard work. I hope everyone should know. What should we do today, especially at this moment? What I want to tell everyone is that we should do everything we can to make these industrial warriors who are contributing their hard work feel at ease and work with hope. This is our only urgent task. (Original by Hisazo Takayama. Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, March 6th)</p>
<h3>Aoki Receives German Reporter</h3>
<p>Essen, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – Japanese Greater East Asia Minister Aoki received the Tokyo correspondent of the Essen National Daily, Mr. Dieserkling. This was the first time Aoki received a foreign reporter. He said that the Ministry of Greater East Asia and the Japanese military headquarters are jointly formulating a construction plan. In terms of economy, they will develop resources. After the war, Asia and Europe will exchange goods on a large scale. Aoki claimed that the rumor of issuing a unified currency for Greater East Asia is not true. The Peso of the Philippines and the currency of the Dutch East Indies will continue to be retained.</p>

<h3>European Economic and Military Resources Under Decisive Battle: Germany Takes the Lead</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Berlin by Tatsutaro Kasagi, 4th) In the European war, centered on the German-Soviet conflict, both sides are exerting their final strength in a fierce struggle. The economic power that determines this mortal combat has also mobilized its last resources. However, this economic power was not created hastily, but accumulated over decades of tireless effort. Current productivity is built on past foundations and constrained by them. Nevertheless, the recovery of this productivity, in both quality and quantity, has been augmented with new efforts, and its pace has accelerated. A year ago, we all thought that every country was already using the most recently manufactured weapons in the war, but since then, we have felt that fresh factory products produced under bombardment are continuously appearing on the front lines. Although surprising new weapons are rare, the competition in the performance of aircraft, tanks, artillery, explosives, and other items is intensifying, and both sides need to consume astonishingly large quantities. One of the characteristics of the Soviet counteroffensive, like last year's German offensive, is the concentrated use of warfare, firing massive amounts of shells regardless of consumption. As such, military production today cannot but exhaust all its strength and exert its highest capabilities. However, the foundation of military production is constrained by the rise and fall of the production volume of basic raw materials such as iron and coal. Therefore, the active force that constitutes war power should first be the problem of the production volume of iron and coal. Generally speaking, although countries are making extraordinary efforts to produce basic raw materials during wartime, due to traffic obstruction, labor shortages, and the low efficiency of new labor forces, there is instead a tendency to decline. World oil production appears to have reached its peak in 1941, as has coal.</p>
<p>Coal and Iron Production in Various Countries</p>
<p>Britain's coal production has clearly decreased sharply during the war. The peak of 230 million tons in 1938 can be considered the apex. In 1941, it was 206 million tons, and last year it is estimated to have decreased to 200 million tons. Britain's copper and iron production was 14 million tons before the war in 1937, and is now approximately 10 million to 12 million tons. As for other purely military supplies such as aluminum, contrary to the trend of sharp increases during wartime, it is considered very smooth if they can generally maintain pre-war production levels. The ups and downs of Germany's coal production cannot be detailed, but due to the semi-obligatory system of Sunday labor, the large-scale adoption of foreign labor, and the use of mining machinery, efforts have been made to increase its production rate desperately, even under continuous British bombing raids. Before the war, it was 400 million tons, and now, after incorporating the occupied territories, it is 500 million tons. This number is truly enormous, even enough to supply Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, France, and the Balkan countries, from which Germany obtains military raw materials and other necessities as compensation. Steel production was about 20 million tons before the war, and now it is announced as 40 million tons. This is also due to the incorporation of new territories. Although the actual efficiency is unknown, the increase in absolute numbers, whether coal or iron, is undoubtedly certain. The scale of military production built on this foundation is also imaginable, and its function is two to three times that of Britain. As for the Soviet Union, most of European Russia and part of the Caucasus have been ravaged, and mines and factories have been destroyed by themselves. According to pre-war statistics, the Soviet Union has already lost 64% of its iron ore and 61% of its coal during the war. Part of its equipment has also been relocated. Although military factories have long been moved to the Ural region, steel cable production has decreased by 20 million tons and coal has decreased by 150 million tons compared to pre-war levels. It can be seen that the impact is quite profound. If we exclude American aid, Germany is far superior to Britain and the Soviet Union in terms of iron and coal alone.</p>
<p>Looking at oil, which is most directly related to war power, the Soviet Union's oil production was 30 million tons in 1938, of which Caucasian oil accounted for 90%. This enormous quantity was not even enough for the Soviet Union's agricultural mechanization before the war. Since the German army cut off the Caucasian railway last summer and the Volga River froze last winter, Soviet oil has been severely restricted, at least in terms of transportation. It can only transfer the oil used for Ukrainian agriculture to military use. As for Germany's oil reserves, if we combine Germany's domestic oil and synthetic fuels with those of other Axis countries and occupied territories, the production volume for last year is expected to be enormous. Germany does not use much fuel for agriculture, so there should be no temporary changes after acquiring Romanian oil.</p>
<p>Germany's Production Restructuring</p>
<p>After possessing the above-mentioned enormous basic raw materials, Germany's current production has been reorganized. Regarding weapons, there was sufficient leeway for preparation, at least until the spring of last year. Therefore, in last year's offensives in Crimea, Kharkov, and Stalingrad, engines and high-density firepower artillery shells were fired without hesitation, and the consumption quantity also increased accordingly. After Minister of Munitions Speer took office last year, he inaugurated a new era for German military production, progressing at an amazing speed. In April, a central planning department was established within the Four-Year Plan Office, determining the highest comprehensive plan and ensuring the priority of military needs. At the same time, the Munitions Bureau, which originally belonged to the commander of the Wehrmacht, was also transferred to the Ministry of Munitions, which had full authority to supervise and guide military production. On one hand, new groups were organized for military production and specific military product producers, allowing them to operate as independent organizations similar to those of the Ministry of Economy. Among civilian industries and export industries, operations were shut down or reduced and reorganized for military production, shutting down low-efficiency operations and concentrating production in high-efficiency operations. This was rapidly completed last year. The construction of new factories was stopped, and existing equipment was fully utilized after being replaced two or three times. The military production policy was changed at this point. All raw materials and resources were directly used for the accelerated production of military supplies. This has been the case since the spring of last year. The reorganization of production has been largely completed through the above-mentioned measures. The recent mobilization, which has brought all women to work in factories, is to make up for the shortage of labor. Women are used as much as possible to replace the original labor, so that a huge new force can be extracted and formed.</p>
<p>There are currently six million foreign workers in use. To ensure the continuous participation of new labor, President Hitler's proclamation on the 24th of last month required this country, France, Lithuania, and Greece to close shops roughly similar to those in Germany, and to draw out a large amount of labor from peacetime industries. According to news reports, women over the age of 45 are also encouraged to voluntarily apply for labor. The allied countries of Europe and all occupied territories will implement a "historically unprecedented total mobilization."</p>
<p>Current Status of Food Problems in Various Countries</p>
<p>Regarding the food problem, the most drastic changes in the past year have been in the Soviet Union. The situation in Britain is also gradually becoming more severe. As for Germany, because it has already implemented a minimum level of control, there have been no changes, at least on the surface, in the past year. According to Swiss newspapers, by last year, the Soviet Union had lost 40% of its miscellaneous production, 50% of its livestock holdings, and 88% of its sugar production in the vast areas abandoned due to the German invasion. The remaining population in this area accounts for 2% of the total population. Although this may be somewhat exaggerated, the magnitude of these numbers cannot be disputed. The transportation of surplus products from Central Asia and Siberia cannot be viewed optimistically due to military transportation needs. Last September, the monthly food ration was: 200 grams of meat, 200 grams of oil, and 2,700 grams of bread (weekly amount). This is compared to the monthly ration for ordinary consumers in Germany (amount for four weeks): 1,400 grams of meat, 824 grams of oil, and 2,250 grams of bread (one week). There is clearly a large difference, except for bread. Moreover, although the ration for Soviet heavy industry workers and the military is higher, with reports of a sevenfold increase in meat and oil, it is still lower than the ration for German heavy industry workers. It can be said that the Soviet Union's crisis last year was resolved by importing food from the United States. Generally speaking, the food problem for the public has indeed become quite difficult.</p>
<p>The food problem in Britain is also approaching its end. Bread will now also have to be rationed. Until now, although it seems to be in a predicament, it is eking out a living with imports from the United States and Canada. However, imports are entirely dependent on shipping issues, so it cannot be said that Britain's food is fundamentally stable. The Minister of Food personally stated last autumn that "the food situation in Britain will undergo major changes within the year." With merchant ship sinkings being reported daily, the future is by no means bright.</p>
<p>In summary, Germany should not be complacent and joyful about the food problem on the current Eastern Front, but it is much better than the opposing camp. Even compared to neighboring allied countries, its rations are quite balanced and universal, so it can maintain low prices and ensure the minimum amount of food for the lives of workers and other general public, and feel at ease.</p>
<p>Price Problem</p>
<p>The economic turmoil in various countries, centered on the food problem, cannot directly determine their political situation, but the soaring of prices in economic phenomena casts a shadow of political unease on the minds of the general public. Except for Germany, the price levels in various countries seem to be rising like tides. Until the summer of last year, the average retail prices over three years were 65% in Britain, 98% in neutral Switzerland, 86% in Hungary, and 6% in Germany. This is the official report. Actual living costs may be different, as there are black market prices in each country. In a certain small Balkan country, prices have increased three to four times in the past two years. However, the above-mentioned index is still a general trend.</p>
<p>The political situation is not related to the rise in prices, but the psychological reflection caused by the rise in prices is directly related to the stability of the political situation. This is not a problem in Germany itself, which has strict control, but the price situation in its allied countries, such as Romania, Bulgaria, and other Balkan countries, is a cause for concern. Therefore, German Finance Minister Funk said that Germany's economic problem is not Germany itself, but the economic problems of its allied countries and occupied territories around Germany.</p>
<p>The rising prices in Southeast European countries, neutral countries, and Italy are forcing countries to constantly change their trade agreements with each other. Because the defense of the European continent is bound to be centered on Germany, even neutral European countries cannot but mobilize economically for Germany. More than half of Sweden's exports go to Germany, and three-quarters of Switzerland's trade is with Germany. Swiss factories work for Germany's military production. Although the payment agreement between Germany and Switzerland has not been extended, it is actually proceeding as before in the absence of an agreement. Germany has even mobilized potential foreign exchange in Switzerland to supplement its payment methods. After the revision of trade agreements, the total amount of the agreement tends to increase, and its content reflects the changes in the economic situation of both parties. The increase in Germany's clearing balance with various countries indicates that Germany is gradually becoming the center for purchasing goods in Europe.</p>
<p>After Germany obtains a decisive victory, its powerful productivity can easily compensate for the trade balance, so it can be regarded as a "reliable deposit." This is equivalent to putting excess currency in the country into cold storage before the end of the war, waiting for it to be resolved after the war. However, Germany's over-borrowing is a much smaller problem compared to the situation in Britain, which has rapidly increased its debt to the United States due to the American Lend-Lease Act. The increase in this debt has weakened Britain's position in speaking to the United States, causing it to be coerced by the United States and the Soviet Union, which is the reason for Britain's recent anxiety. Britain's economic distress is even greater than the domestic food problem, promoting the decline of the British Empire. If the war continues, its distress will become even more profound.</p>
<p>Changes in the European Economy</p>
<p>In conclusion, this all indicates the extraordinary tension in the economies of European countries under the decisive battle situation. The sense of tension is very different from a year ago, and many changes have occurred. Generally speaking, there are two major significant directions. First, the European economy is progressing towards organization centered on Germany.</p>
<p>First, we have the significant changes in Germany's internal economic structure. On one hand, under the guidance of Minister of Munitions Speer, the munitions industry is trending towards efficiency and centralization, and the labor force is being reorganized. On the other hand, under the guidance of Minister of Economy Funk, the control mechanism has been completed due to the management of all business operations.</p>
<p>This is one aspect of Germany's wartime economic strengthening and sophistication. The exchange of goods in Europe, centered on Germany, forms an economic group including all neutral countries. Second, is the passive aspect. Regardless of the Axis or anti-Axis groups, they are all developing towards inflation due to the gradual lack of materials. This tendency opposes organization and has the effect of disintegrating the economy. This first lies dormant in neutral countries, causing general fluctuations. The economic turmoil reflected in people's minds will then develop into political turmoil. This is the aspect that needs the most attention at present. Therefore, the most special problem at present is not only military, but also economic, focused on the struggle for Ukraine. The gains and losses of this struggle will double the difference in the economic characteristics of the two sides. The purpose of Germany's final total mobilization is precisely this. However, the current stage of the European economy has not yet had a decisive impact on victory or defeat. The most important thing at present is still the development of the war situation, but the economic power that actively supports this battle is gradually becoming the stage of stimulating the national psychology in economic life. Strong national character can be stimulated by this. Therefore, what determines everything in the end is the national spirit spurred by the economic pressure. (Xiang: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, March 6) Regarding Soviet relations, the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mr. Standley, recently made comments which he did not wish to comment on. When asked whether the President had previously expressed his willingness to meet with Stalin after the Casablanca Conference, Mr. Roosevelt also did not wish to give any affirmative indication on that question.</p>
<p>Argentina, Keijo, 13th, Haitong News Agency: It is learned here that Roosevelt declared at the Washington intelligence meeting today that although the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mr. Standley, is a man of few words, he sometimes likes to be loquacious. Roosevelt refused to comment on the Soviet government's attitude towards the United States as described in Mr. Standley's recent remarks.</p>
<h3>Rumor that the Polish Government Plans to Move to the United States</h3>
<p>Sweden, Keijo, 13th, Haitong News Agency: The Daily Mail reports that General Sikorski, leader of the Polish government-in-exile, has notified the British Foreign Office that he intends to move the Polish government from London to Washington to protest the British attitude towards the Soviet-Polish dispute. It is said that Mr. Sikorski met with the U.S. Charge d'Affaires in Britain before submitting the notification, so this decision was agreed to by the U.S. side.</p>
<h3>Intense Dispute Over Australia and New Zealand Income Tax Cases</h3>
<p>Sweden, Keijo, 13th, Haitong News Agency: According to news from Sydney, when the Australian Senate met yesterday, the government attempted to link the Income Tax Bill with the National Welfare Fund Bill. Senators had divergent opinions and would not yield to each other. Prime Minister Curtin has decided to convene a cabinet meeting the day after tomorrow to discuss the issue. The government believes that this bill should be passed or rejected at the same time, but the opposition criticized the government for using the National Welfare Bill to appease the public bearing the new tax and depriving the Senate of the right to pass tax bills and reject the welfare bill.</p>
<h3>British and American Troops Reinforce in Preparation for Offensives; Axis Forces Near Thamirah Advance Towards British Positions Three Times</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 13th, Allied News Agency: According to news received here last night, in the battles of French Tunisia, there were only minor localized battles in the northern coastal areas on Wednesday and Thursday, and Axis reconnaissance teams attacked in front of the southern Mareth Line. Berlin news reported that British troops shelled several forts on the Mareth Line, indicating that British General Montgomery has made preparations there and is expected to launch an offensive at any time. In northern Tunisia, a British tank team attempted to approach the main Axis front line but was repelled. However, a Reuters dispatch from the Allied headquarters stated that the Axis forces near Thamirah attacked with infantry, covered by artillery fire, and advanced towards the British positions three times. Axis patrol teams inside Tunisia attacked the positions of the British Eighth Army several times in front of the Mareth Line, destroying several vehicles and returning to their defenses after capturing several British soldiers. The Axis reconnaissance team confirmed that Montgomery's troops have received reinforcements of troops, tanks, and aircraft. Its main force consists of the British 44th Division, 51st Division, British Guards 201st Brigade, New Zealand 2nd Division, and two tank detachments, all gathered between the coast and the mountains west of Sha'ao, and seems to have completed all preparations for attacking the African Corps of German General Rommel on the Mareth Line.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th, Haitong News Agency: After suffering a disastrous defeat last month, the American troops in central and southern Tunisia have recently received reinforcements from Morocco, Algeria, and other places. However, these reinforcements also lack combat experience and are no better than the previously defeated American troops. Northwest of the Great Salt Lake, desert combat units under Tegor have recently been discovered, whose mission seems to be to connect the U.S. Fifth Army and the British Eighth Army. However, due to the special terrain there, it is feared that it will be difficult to achieve this goal. As for the main force of the British Eighth Army, including the 44th and 51st Infantry Divisions, as well as the attached two Zuke Brigades, the New Zealand 2nd Division, and the British 21st Guards Brigade, they have been deployed in front of the Mareth Line. Some British artillery has already shelled the Axis positions, and it is expected that the day of the general offensive is not far away. However, it is unknown whether the U.S. Fifth Army and the British First Army have also completed preparations.</p>
<h3>Japanese Occupied Territories in the South Pacific Promulgate Exchange Control Orders</h3>
<p>Jakarta, 13th, Central News Agency: The Japanese military administration in Java has specially formulated the Exchange Control Order for the occupied territories in the South Pacific to facilitate the smooth exchange of funds between various places in the South Pacific. It was officially announced today by administrative order and will be implemented from the 15th of this month. In the past, remittances between the occupied territories in the South Pacific such as Malaya, Sumatra, Burma, North Borneo, and Java were limited to Japanese soldiers, military personnel, and general Japanese travelers' travel expenses. However, after the implementation of the new management order, indigenous people and overseas Chinese, as well as other foreign nationals, can also freely remit funds, which is very convenient for the general public.</p>
<h3>Lao Cai Inspection Report on the Northwest End of the Vietnam Border</h3>
<p>Hanoi, 13th, Central News Agency: The key areas along the Yunnan-Vietnam railway line and the neighboring Vietnamese areas such as Wen Shan in the east have all been occupied by the Yu direct line army. Therefore, since the end of last year, the Vietnamese army has been strengthening its forward defenses along the border and rushing to build a long and large fortress defense line. The Yu and Vietnamese armies are confronting each other on the border. In order to understand the truth of the situation in that area, the reporter recently went to Lao Cai, the northwest end of the Vietnamese border defense line, for inspection. The streets of Lao Cai are built in the mountains along the Nanxi River, with a population of about 1,400 people. Because it is a distribution center for materials in the surrounding area, it is a gathering place for overseas Chinese and various ethnic minorities. Outside the Lao Cai station is the confluence of the Red River and the Nanxi River. Looking at the opposite bank from afar, it forms a T-shape, which is where the enemy's position is located. It is located on the left bank of the Red River, on a cliff of gray soil. A large triangular fortress is built in gray, and black gun emplacements can be vaguely seen around it. The tricolor flag hanging on the fortress flutters in the wind. The remains of a destroyed iron bridge still lie across the shallow stream. Eighty meters from the north bank, houses are densely packed, appearing to be a street. Armed Yu troops can be seen on the opposite bank. The Yu troops currently guarding the street at the river mouth are part of the "198th Division of the 54th Army." The garrison commander is Pan Yukun, deputy division commander of the division. Behind the street are white trenches winding through the continuous mountains. From the first peak on the right to the fourth peak on the left, it is the enemy's first line of defense. Once the war starts, the street of Lao Cai will bear the brunt, because the two places are so close. When I was about to view the enemy's bunker, I suddenly saw the enemy's sentry post, which seemed to be gradually approaching. The tense situation was evident. This border has been effectively sealed off since the Japanese army entered. However, because the Yu side is short of materials, if traffic with Lao Cai is cut off, the lives of the Yu people on the opposite bank will be impossible to solve. Therefore, after the agreement between Lao Cai and Hekou, Yu people are allowed to go to Lao Cai for shopping from 8:00 am to 11:00 am every day. Under the strict supervision of tax officials and military police sent by both parties, about 300 overseas Chinese are allowed to cross the river to shop every day, mostly women. They take a ferry to Lao Cai and purchase daily necessities within the permitted scope in shops opened by overseas Chinese before returning. Although the two places are separated by a river, the prices are two or three times different. The miserable and desolate scene on the Yu side is in stark contrast to the prosperous situation on the Vietnamese side. After the Japanese army air force entered Vietnam on January 28 last year, it heavily bombed the power facilities of the Yu side in Hekou. The remains of the bombing can still be seen on this shore. Now, the Yu army soldiers and officers feel that the number of people surrendering from the resistance is increasing day by day. I met four Yu officers, including Captain Liu, who had come to the street market of overseas Chinese. Captain Liu was originally the captain of the Second Company of the 25th Division of the Yu Central 52nd Army. He resolutely returned two weeks ago and is now engaged in farming there. According to him, no one in the Yu army now believes that they can achieve final victory. The Yu army is currently short of food on the Yunnan border, and the military salary is only 80 yuan per month, but prices are very high. Ordinary cigarettes cost 25 yuan per pack. The local people on the border do not speak the Yunnan dialect, which deepens the alienation between the military and the people. Moreover, due to the spread of epidemics, many people have died. News of the Japanese victory, even after any concealment, will still be heard. In addition, Captain Gan, who surrendered from the 184th Division of the Yunnan Army, said that Long Handou, the brigade commander of the 3rd Brigade of the 60th Army of Yunnan, is a brother of Long Yun. He was previously confined to the western Yunnan area due to the pressure of the Yu direct line army, and his actions were closely monitored. Until last year, his secret transportation of military supplies from Vietnam was discovered by the Yu side, and he was arrested by the Yu side and sent to Chongqing. The previous rumor that Long Yun was arrested was actually a mistake about this matter. However, since then, Long Yun's military power has been effectively deprived. Recently, the 20th Army Group of the Yu side was transferred to the Yunnan Province, and Zhang Fakui also arrived in Kunming at the same time. It is also learned that the 52nd Army of the Yu side will soon be transferred to Guangdong, and the 54th Army will move towards Burma, exchanging defenses with the troops required by the 20th Army Group. Also, the enemy's defensive position seen on the opposite bank in Lao Cai is a guard position. Its main position is far behind, more than 100 kilometers away.</p>

<h3>National Commercial Control Association - Nomination of Directors and Supervisors - Officially Established Tomorrow - Chairman Tang Shoumin - Supervisor Wen Lanting</h3>
<p>The National Commercial Control Association, since the Supreme National Defense Council designated Tang Shoumin, Wu Zhenxiu, and twenty others as initiators of the association, held its first preparatory meeting in Shanghai on the 11th. It nominated Tang Shoumin, Wu Zhenxiu, Lin Kanghou, Jiang Shangda, Xu Guanqun, and five others as members of the articles of association drafting committee. After the members drafted the articles of association on the 12th, the second preparatory meeting was continued at the Shanghai branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association on Jessfield Road yesterday (13th) at 4 p.m. All preparatory committee members attended, and Secretary-General Zhao of the Municipal Government, Director Wang of the Economic Bureau, and Directors Guo, Hong, Chen, Zhong, Xiang, Sun Zuji, and Zhang Jun of the Ministry of Industry were present. Minister Mei of the Ministry of Industry also came to provide guidance. The meeting commenced as scheduled, and Committee Member Tang Shoumin was publicly elected as temporary chairman. After reporting the meaning of the meeting, the articles of association, totaling forty-seven articles, were discussed and approved after amendments. They will be submitted to the Ministry for approval and promulgation. Tang Shoumin was then nominated as Chairman of the Board, and Wen Lanting as Supervisor. It was also decided that the association would be officially established on the 15th of this month. The list of elected directors and supervisors and a summary of the internal organization of the association are listed below:</p>
<p>Nomination of Directors and Supervisors</p>
<p>Chairman: Tang Shoumin; Directors: Wu Zhenxiu, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Jiang Shangda, Ye Fuxiao, Xu Guanqun, Li Zufan, Chen Shuiyu, Tong Lvqing, Li Ze, Sun Shenli, Cai Shengbai, Ding Houqing; Supervisor: Wen Lanting; Supervisors: Zhou Zuomin, Guo Shun, Yun Qing, Lu Zhixue, Huang Jiangquan.</p>
<p>Internal Organization</p>
<p>It is reported that the internal organization of the association, in addition to the establishment of a Board of Directors and a Board of Supervisors, is divided into (1) General Affairs Department, (2) Audit Department, (3) Materials Department, and (4) Finance Department, to handle all matters related to materials control. It is also reported that the association may establish various specialized committees as needed.</p>
<p>Industry Registration</p>
<p>In order to implement rational economic control, purchase materials nationwide, and centralize distribution, the National Government decided to establish the National Commercial Control Association and designated reputable industry leaders as initiators to be responsible for handling autonomous control matters. The organizational system of this commercial control institution is divided into (1) local industry associations, (2) industry federations, and (3) the National Commercial Control Association. It is learned that the local authorities in this port, in order to strengthen material control in the future, had previously ordered various industry associations to register. By the end of last month, approximately 300 had registered, with affiliated factories and shops reaching 36,000. However, among the various industry associations, some have similar characteristics, and it may be necessary to gradually merge them in the future to streamline the control work. The count is: 6 associations in the metal sector, 13 in the machinery sector, 17 in general merchandise, 6 in clothing, 9 in liquor and sauce, 25 in food, 6 in food and beverage, 28 in textiles, 7 in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, 13 in manufacturing, 9 in fuel, 6 in leather, 7 in paints and dyes, 5 in cereals, 6 in oils, 4 in tobacco, 4 in transportation, 3 in photographic equipment, 5 in books and stationery, 4 in finance, and 17 in other categories.</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Promotion Association Reception - Ambassador Arita - Leaders from All Walks of Life Participate in Tea Party for Cordial Conversation</h3>
<p>Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam, Arita Hachiro, made a brief stop in Shanghai on his way back to Saigon. The National Diplomatic Promotion Association of this city held a grand tea party yesterday (13th) at 4:30 p.m. on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel to receive him, inviting important leaders from all walks of life to accompany him. Those present included Zhou Zuomin, Tang Shoumin, Xu Jianbing, Zhao Zunyue, Sun Mingqi, Zhou Jue, Zhang Yipeng, Chen Binhe, and others. From the friendly country, there were General Manager of the Public Works Department, Sawazawa Seiichi, Japanese Deputy Consul in Shanghai, Iwai Eiichi, business leader Funatsu Tatsuichiro, and directors and supervisors of the association, Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Zhao Jinqing, Wu Kaisheng, Zhao Zhengping, and more than fifty others. Ambassador Arita arrived at the meeting at 4:45 p.m. and was cordially received by Wu Kaisheng, Zhao Jinqing, and Yuan Ludeng, who represented the National Diplomatic Promotion Association, and they introduced the ambassador to the attendees. The guests and host conversed cordially for a time, and the meeting ended with satisfaction at around 6 p.m.</p>
<h3>Silk and Cloth Shops - Inventory Registration - Xie Da Xiang and Others Unsealed - Secret Investigation of Tampered Rulers</h3>
<p>The authorities have long formulated price limits for goods sold by various silk and cloth shops in this port. However, at that time, because the inventory of each shop was not investigated thoroughly, there were occurrences of fraud in various shops. In order to remedy this shortcoming, the industry association has been ordered to carry out inventory registration. All cloth shops should comply. If there are false reports, once discovered, the business license will be revoked and the business ordered to close. Recently, inaccurate rulers used by various silk and cloth shops have also been frequently discovered. Therefore, in order to prevent residents from being deceived by these shops, the authorities have also dispatched plainclothes detectives to conduct investigations in each shop. Regarding the matter of the authorities ordering all shops to uniformly use specially manufactured standard rulers, according to the reporter's inquiry from Datong Daily, it is still under expert research.</p>
<p>Unsealing of Shops and Penalties Unknown</p>
<p>The police authorities of the French Concession strictly manage various shops in the concession and send out a large number of secret agents to closely investigate illegal shops. If there are price increases, once verified, a sealing-up penalty will be imposed. A few days ago, Xie Da Xiang Foreign Cloth Shop and others were sealed up for price increases. However, they have been unsealed as of yesterday. As for the issue of fines, the French authorities have not yet officially announced it. It is reported that the French police authorities and the Evaluation Committee authorities summoned the shop owners for a reprimand and instructed them to strictly comply with the authorities' intentions in the future. If the above-mentioned situation occurs again, more severe penalties will be imposed. The purchase is only in order. From the sentry box, only three hundred and eighty-nine seats have been completely built so far, with one hundred and twenty-four seats missing. We still need the cooperation of all parties. Statistics show that theft cases in Nanshi have indeed decreased significantly in the past six months. The number of criminals arrested by the police force in half a year is about one hundred. There are still many improvements to be made in the police force's facilities in the future. I hope that all parties will continue to provide cooperation and suggestions at any time, etc. Next, Zhu Yunsheng represented Director Lu in delivering a speech, and Instructor Nishimura gave a speech. The situation was extremely harmonious during the banquet, and it ended at around 3 p.m.</p>
<h3>Buddhist Association Continues to Distribute Congee as Usual</h3>
<p>The congee distribution center established by the Shanghai Buddhist Association in the Guandi Temple in Nanshi has been in operation for more than a year, distributing congee to more than 3,000 impoverished people daily, which is truly a great benefit to society. Recently, the association suspended congee distribution once in order to sort out congee tickets. Now that the sorting is complete, congee distribution has resumed as usual from 8:30 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. every day since the 12th.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Household Rice Rationing Situation in the Two Concessions</h3>
<p>After the formal establishment of the Grain Department, in order to actively promote the wartime food policy, it is urgent to understand the household rice rationing situation in the Public Concession and the French Concession in this city in the past. Therefore, a special form has been created, instructing the Municipal Grain Administration to investigate and report in accordance with the form for reference by the Ministry.</p>
<h3>Strictly Enforce Wartime Economic Laws and Regulations - Strive to Complete Wartime Economic Policy - Talk by Wang Zhigang, Director of the Economic Bureau</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency visited Wang Zhigang, Director of the Municipal Economic Bureau, to inquire about his thoughts on the National Government's promulgation of the two provisional regulations on the Prohibition of Wartime Materials Movement and the National Commercial Control Association. Wang made the following remarks: "The Wartime Economic Policy Outline and the regulations stipulating that industrial and commercial organizations should be purely economic institutions and not participate in political movements and training were previously deliberated and promulgated by the Supreme National Defense Council separately. The National Government promulgated the regulations on the Prohibition of Wartime Materials Movement and the National Commercial Control Association on the 11th. According to these laws and regulations, the purpose is to seek the establishment of a wartime economic system and the strengthening of wartime economic power. This bureau manages the economy of this city, and it is its responsibility. In the future, it will strictly enforce all laws and regulations promulgated by the National Government regarding material control and price stabilization, and the management of industrial and commercial organizations, so as to gradually improve the soundness and rationality of the economic structure of this city under the guidance and supervision of the government. As for the concession area, we will maintain close liaison with the concession authorities and other relevant parties in the future so that the economic administration in the urban area can be consistent with the cooperation of all parties. In short, the strict enforcement of wartime economic laws and regulations is to achieve a balance between supply and demand of materials, rational distribution, and price stabilization, in order to complete the wartime economic policy. At this time of war, the government is implementing rational control measures under the wartime system, on the one hand, to ensure military supplies, and on the other hand, to strive to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, in order to seek the economic recovery of the country. I hope that all sectors of the city will understand this and work together. If there are still violations of all wartime economic laws and regulations in the future, once discovered, they will be dealt with strictly in accordance with the law. Please do not make mistakes."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Government Jurisdiction - Divided into Two Regions - 19 Districts in the Urban Area, 7 Special Districts - Formation of Boundary Committee to Survey Boundaries</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government believes that the new jurisdictional area is several times larger than before the incident, and the district is vast, making it extremely difficult to implement municipal administration. Therefore, the city area is divided into urban and special areas and reorganized in accordance with the Special District Office Organization Regulations promulgated by the Executive Yuan. It is learned that the urban area is planned to be divided into 19 autonomous regions such as Hunan, Caojing, Fahua, Pusong, Zhabei, Xiang, Yinhang, Sanlin, and Dachang. The special area will be reorganized separately from seven districts including Beiqiao, Baoshan, Nanhui, Fengxian, Chuansha, Jiading, and Chongming. A boundary committee and a Baotou committee are currently being formed, and preparations are being made to hold a district chief training center in order to gradually promote local autonomy and complete the city's organization.</p>

Although most have already been replaced in accordance with the regulations, there are still a few who are waiting and watching and delaying the exchange. The West Shanghai Police Department recently issued an announcement, limiting hotels, boarding houses, apartments, public entertainment venues, clubs, employment agencies, dance halls, and wine shops in the area who have not followed the regulations to obtain business licenses for this year to follow the regulations by the end of March at the Second Section of the bureau and report to the municipal government for investigation at any time.

<h3>Large Number of Empty Oil Drums - Transported to Pudong - Preparing to Fill Oil - Transported to Shanghai for Rationing</h3>
<p>After the establishment of the rationed oil system, the concession authorities in this city have distributed cooking oil purchase certificates to each Baotou district. However, the oil purchase date is of great concern to all parties. It is learned that the cooking oil industry wholesale office has already transported a large number of iron drums to various oil pressing factories in Pudong yesterday to fill oil in order to realize it as soon as possible to meet the urgent needs of the citizens. About 500 barrels can be filled in two or three days and will be transported to Puxi for distribution to the concession rationing agencies.</p>
<h3>Strict Inspection of Residence Registration at Iron Gates in Urban Area Starting Yesterday - Those Who Do Not Carry Certificates Are Prohibited from Passing - Old Citizen Certificates Confiscated</h3>

At the same time, the heads of each branch were ordered, saying, "It has been ordered that the People's Residence Certificate in the urban area must be filled out by the end of March, and it has been announced in accordance with the law. There are not many days left until the end date. The heads of each branch should carefully plan and send police to check from door to door from today and order the police on duty to check pedestrians at any time. Those without a residence certificate are prohibited from passing to warn against negligence. At the same time, explain the importance of the residence certificate and order them to apply for it as soon as possible, so as to ensure that the deadline is completed and the decree is given importance."</p>
<h3>I am Also One of Shanghai - A Talk by Ambassador Arita</h3>
<p>Standing on the edge of the Waibaidu Bridge, in the skyscraper Broadway Mansion, a kind and amiable Ambassador Arita adds to the scenery on the second floor lobby. At four o'clock on the afternoon of the twelfth, Ambassador Arita invited news reporters here. He sat quietly in a large leather chair, wearing a tea-colored suit, with gray hair. His face was still so clear and healthy that you couldn't tell he was seventy-two years old. He opened the conversation with a smile. He said first: "Let me first give a general overview, or should I listen to your questions first?" Then he said again, "I'll speak first!"</p>
<p>I have a very good relationship with Shanghai. In March of Meiji 35, I was transferred from Xiamen to Shanghai to serve as consul for two years. Later, I went to Beijing as a minister for six years. In Showa 4, from January to June, I negotiated with the National Government at the time to resolve the Jinan Incident, which lasted six months. Later, I came to Shanghai two or three times. So I understand the general situation of everything in Shanghai very well.</p>
<p>At the League of Nations meeting during the Manchurian Incident, I demonstrated unyielding diplomatic negotiations. When I was serving as the minister in Beijing, the current emperor of Manchukuo also came to the Beijing Embassy to take refuge because he felt that there was danger around him. Many historical traces from the past are still lingering in his mind. He then answered the news reporters' questions:</p>
<p>I wanted to buy a hat in Fukuoka, so I went to a foreign goods store. I picked out a hat, and after paying, just as I was about to reach out to take the hat, the clerk said to me, "Please pay with a clothing coupon." (Translator's note: Japan controls all goods and implements a system of rationing goods according to population. Shopping requires a coupon.) But since I was returning from a foreign country, of course I didn't have a clothing coupon with me, so I had no choice but to ask the store to return the money and went back. Shanghai also has a system of rationing sugar and charcoal! (Yunpeng: Translated from the March 13 issue of the Mainland News)</p>
<h3>Promoting Bills of Exchange in the Banking and Finance Industry: Acceptance and Discounting Allowed; Stipulating a Time Limit for Collateral of Goods; Guarantors Liable for Repayment</h3>
<p>In order to prevent the use of financing to fuel speculation and hoarding, all banks and financial firms have followed the new lending measures passed by the trade association to tighten restrictions. As for commercial acceptance bills, efforts are being made to promote them. Recently, all banks and firms have agreed to provide convenience for acceptance and discounting in accordance with bank acceptance contracts. The contract methods are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Goods as Collateral for Bank Acceptance</p>
<p>(1) The bill of exchange issued by the contracting party is limited to paying off a certain amount of money for a specific purpose. (2) The due date of the bill of exchange issued by the contracting party shall not exceed a certain number of days after the date of issue, but it should expire before a certain day, month, and year in the Republic of China. (3) The contracting party shall deposit the cash with your bank at the latest one day before the expiration of the bill of exchange for payment and will not delay. (4) The acceptance fee is calculated at a certain amount per month per thousand yuan of the face value of the bill, but if the bill period is less than one month, it shall be calculated as one month, and the contracting party shall pay it with the bill each time it requests acceptance. (5) Your bank may notify the contracting party at any time to stop acceptance or reduce the limit or shorten the period stipulated in Article 1 of this contract, and the contracting party is willing to comply. (6) The contracting party and the guarantor solemnly declare that the collaterals opened on the back of this contract or to be delivered in the future are entirely owned by the contracting party, and no other person has any rights. If disputes arise in the future and cause your bank to suffer losses, the contracting party and the guarantor shall be jointly and severally liable for compensation. (7) Regarding the quality and quantity of the collaterals contained in the warehouse receipts, bills of lading, and other documents, the contracting party and the guarantor guarantee that they are completely accurate. If discrepancies in quality, shortage in quantity, or false content are found in the future, regardless of whether the collaterals are stored in your bank's own warehouse or in other warehouses or in transit, the contracting party and the guarantor shall be jointly and severally liable. (8) The warehouse bills of lading and other documents in the preceding article shall be endorsed by the contracting party to establish a pledge at the time of delivery, and transferred to your bank's account. In the future, your bank may extract or inspect the contents of the collaterals at any time. If it is later found that the transfer procedures are still incomplete, the contracting party shall complete the supplementary defense, and all transfer expenses shall be borne by the contracting party. (9) If your bank believes that the collateral must be moved to the warehouse, the contracting party shall bear the expenses upon notification and immediately comply. In the event of any loss due to the transfer of the warehouse, the contracting party is also willing to be responsible and has nothing to do with your bank. (10) If the collaterals need to go through transportation, customs declaration, or other procedures, the contracting party shall comply, and all expenses shall be borne and paid by the contracting party. (11) Warehouse rents and various donations and taxes payable for the collaterals shall be borne and paid by the contracting party. If fines or detentions are caused by tax evasion or violations, the contracting party shall be responsible for handling them and have nothing to do with your bank. If your bank suffers losses due to the above-mentioned disputes, the contracting party and the guarantor shall be jointly and severally liable for compensation.</p>
<p>Guarantor Fully Responsible</p>
<p>(12) The collaterals shall be insured by the contracting party at the current price in your bank's name (or with your bank as the preferred beneficiary) with the insurance company designated by your bank for fire insurance. If your bank deems it necessary, it may order the contracting party to add water insurance, military insurance, or other insurance, and all expenses shall be borne by the contracting party. All insurance policies and insurance premium receipts shall be delivered to your bank for safekeeping. In the event of an accident, your bank may directly receive the compensation from the insurance company to offset the acceptance and payment made by your bank. If the insurance compensation is insufficient or even cannot be compensated, the contracting party and the guarantor shall still be jointly and severally liable to immediately pay another considerable collateral or cash, and shall not excuse accidental losses to claim exemption from responsibility. If, before receiving the compensation, your bank believes that it is necessary to provide another considerable collateral, the contracting party is also willing to comply. (13) If the contracting party fails to register, transfer, move the warehouse, insure, or handle other procedures or pay various expenses, your bank may handle or pay on its behalf, and the expenses handled or paid on its behalf shall be immediately repaid by the contracting party; otherwise, your bank may calculate interest at the interest rate, but your bank has no obligation to handle or pay on its behalf, and if it does not handle or pay on its behalf, it shall not bear any actual responsibility or loss. (14) If the price of the collateral falls below the market price at the time of the contract, or if there is a trend of decline, the contracting party and the guarantor shall be jointly and severally liable to immediately increase or exchange considerable collateral or pay cash, at least to make up for the amount of the decline. (15) Your bank shall not be liable for any mold, rot, insect infestation, damage, adulteration, leakage, consumption, or destruction of all or part of the collateral due to natural disasters, accidents, and other force majeure events, and the contracting party and the guarantor shall still be jointly and severally liable to immediately increase or pay another considerable collateral or cash. (16) The type and quantity of collateral exchanged or increased by the contracting party shall be approved by your bank. (17) If your bank allows the contracting party to exchange all or part of the collateral or retrieve part of the collateral, it does not need to notify the guarantor, and the guarantor is still jointly and severally liable and shall not raise any objections. (18) The contracting party entrusts your bank as the sole agent for the sale or disposal of the collateral, and this contract is also proof of authorization.</p>
<p>Disposing of Collateral to Compensate for Losses</p>
<p>(19) If the contracting party violates or fails to perform the terms and conditions of this contract, or if your bank believes that there is a risk of violation or non-performance, all the acceptance and payment made by your bank may require the contracting party to immediately repay. Your bank may also sell or dispose of the collateral without notifying the contracting party and the guarantor. The contracting party and the guarantor have no objection to the method of sale, the level of the selling price, and the timing of the sale or how to dispose of it, but your bank has no obligation to sell or dispose of it. If the market price falls without sale or disposal, your bank shall not be liable for all losses. All receipts for the collateral issued to the contracting party after the sale or disposal shall be invalidated, and all expenses incurred due to the sale or disposal shall be borne by the contracting party. (20) The amount obtained from the sale or disposal of the collateral shall be used to offset your bank's acceptance amount and various expenses, and your bank may calculate interest at the interest rate. If the overdue interest is insufficient to repay, the contracting party and the guarantor shall still be jointly and severally liable to immediately make up for it, but if the contracting party still has other funds or properties in any name in your bank's head office or branch known to your bank, your bank may also allocate the funds to pay the insufficient amount. All receipts issued to the contracting party shall be invalidated, or the property shall be sold or disposed of in accordance with the preceding article to offset the sufficient amount. After the collateral and other funds and properties have been sold, disposed of, or allocated, if there is a surplus after offsetting your bank's acceptance amount, overdue interest, and various expenses, your bank may return it or deduct other matured and unmatured amounts owed by the contracting party to your bank, and the debts of other debtors guaranteed by the contracting party in your bank. (21) If lawsuits are caused by this contract, the litigation fees (including your bank's attorney fees) shall be compensated by the contracting party and shall not be evaded.</p>
<p>Waive Court Jurisdiction</p>
<p>(22) If the contracting party violates or fails to perform the terms and conditions of this contract, the guarantor shall be jointly and severally liable to immediately compensate your bank for the acceptance amount, overdue interest, and various expenses. The guarantor shall not delay the performance of the guarantee liability on the grounds that the collateral has not been sold or disposed of, or that the contracting party's property has not been forcibly executed, or any other excuse, and voluntarily waive all the rights of the guarantor related to the guarantee articles in Section 24 of the Civil Law Price Code. (23) The guarantor shall not withdraw the guarantee on its own. Even if the guarantor has declared the withdrawal of the guarantee in the newspaper, the guarantee liability in this contract is still valid, but if your bank believes that the guarantor needs to be replaced, the contracting party shall comply upon notification without any objection. (24) If there is more than one guarantor, they shall all be jointly and severally liable, that is, any guarantor shall be liable for paying your bank's acceptance amount, overdue interest, and various expenses in full. (25) The performance of the terms and conditions contained in this contract by the contracting party and the guarantor shall be at your bank's business premises. (26) If the contracting party and the guarantor violate or fail to perform the terms and conditions of this contract and are sued by your bank, the contracting party and the guarantor voluntarily submit to the jurisdiction of the Chinese court where your bank is located, regardless of whether the contracting party's and the guarantor's domicile, residence, business premises, or nationality have changed, that is, waiving the right to object to the court's jurisdiction.</p>

<h3>The Police Authorities in the Nanshi District Have Decided to Ban Disguised Pawnshops; Existing Pawnshops Have Been Ordered to Close; Pledged Items Must Be Redeemed Within Fifteen Days</h3>
<p>The illegal pawnshops in the old Ximen, Nanyang Bridge, Zhonghua Road, Minguo Road, Xiaobeimen, and Luxiangyuan Road areas of Nanshi District are dedicated to high interest rates and exploiting the poor. The pledged items are forfeited after two or four months, and there are even more than a hundred pawnshops that can accept pawn tickets. They neither fulfill the registration procedures with the authorities nor obtain business licenses. It is obvious that they are taking the opportunity to defraud money and disrupt the area. Although the Municipal Police Bureau has ordered the closure of dozens of illegal pawnshops such as Continental Yufeng and prohibited them from operating, the pledged goods must be redeemed within fifteen days; violators will be severely punished. However, the generally closed pawnshops have changed their appearance, canceled the name of the pawnshop, and written on the signboard "Specializing in the purchase and sale of gold and silver jewelry, diamonds, and other goods." There are also newly opened disguised pawnshops attempting to fool people. According to the reporter's investigation, the Municipal Police Bureau believes that the disguised pawnshops and the pawnshops that have been closed and reopened are actually acting against orders and defying the law. Yesterday, it ordered the respective branch bureaus to strictly ban them and prohibit them from operating under any pretext; violators will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Banning Illegal Pawnshops; One Public Pawnshop Set Up in Nanshi and Zhabei</h3>
<p>Our Municipal Government has long strictly prohibited illegal pawnshops. Now, in order to correct the root cause, it has decided to set up public pawnshops to benefit the common people. The method is to first set up one public pawnshop in Nanshi and Zhabei, and then promote them to other districts. It is heard that the Municipal Government has ordered the Economic Bureau to draft regulations and budgets in detail and submit them for approval and preparation as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Neighborhood Association Guidance Meeting Held; Fire Prevention Lecture; Demonstration of the Effectiveness of Fire Extinguishing Bombs; Notice to Neighborhood Association Chiefs to Attend</h3>
<p>The Neighborhood Association Guidance Committee of the Public Concession, in order to instill fire prevention knowledge in citizens and protect social security, has specifically scheduled a fire prevention lecture and fire extinguishing bomb demonstration meeting at Zhang Garden (ie, the Continental Swimming Pool) on Jing'an Temple Road at 11:00 am today (the 14th), Sunday. As the event is closely related to the neighborhood association's fire protection organization, all neighborhood association chiefs have been notified to attend in person on the due date to gain awareness, so that they can indirectly instill fire prevention knowledge in citizens and protect security.</p>
<h3>Frugal Birthday Banquet to Help Students; Deeply Admired</h3>
<p>Our newspaper received donations from all walks of life yesterday to help students, which is deeply appreciated. We also received a letter from Mr. Gu Naiwang, Naiwen, and Naiqiang, stating that they will use the savings from the frugal 50th birthday celebration of their respected father to help students, which is worthy of admiration for longevity and dedication to the world. The letter said, "The eighth day of the third month of the lunar calendar is the date of the 90th birthday of our father Hongru. Coincidentally, our mother Yu will also celebrate her 50th birthday on the 27th day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar. The year Guiwei coincides with the birthdays of both parents, a auspicious year, needless to say. The children and relatives planned to hold a celebration for the millennium, but our parents, seeing the difficult times, stopped their children from extravagant celebrations, in gratitude. Now, in order to fulfill the kindness and do something for longevity and the world, we have been ordered to save the peach noodles and wine banquet expenses on that day, and transfer them to various charitable organizations, one to wish the two elders longevity and boundless blessings, and the other to fulfill the natural duty of mutual assistance among human beings. Now we offer 500 yuan, hoping that you will receive it and allocate it to the student aid fund to contribute our meager efforts. (The amount of donations to various charitable organizations is listed below.) A total of 500 yuan each for the Xinwen Bao Lending Fund, Tongren Fuyuan Hall, Pushan Villa, Family Aid Village Association (run by Master Gainanxuan), and Nursery Hall. Gu Naiwang, Naiwen, and Naiqiang, jointly."</p>
<p>Student Aid Funds Received Yesterday</p>
<p>The student aid funds received yesterday include: Gu Naiwang, Naiwen, and Naiqiang, 500 yuan; Mrs. Hu, 200 yuan; anonymous (receipt number 2937 from Pu Jiting), 100 yuan; Chen Keren, 30 yuan; surplus money from the Tongren Shouyan meal, 17 yuan; Yang Jingshan, 6 yuan and 3 jiao, totaling 853 yuan and 3 jiao of savings coupons, with a balance of 252,622 yuan, 8 jiao, and 9 fen.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Religious and Moral Association Continues to Hold Spring Relief</h3>
<p>The Chinese Religious and Moral Association in this city, since last winter, seeing that the prices of all goods have soared and the livelihood of the poor has been greatly threatened, has had the initiative to provide porridge and clothes in eleven places inside and outside the city. Since its implementation, it has greatly benefited the poor. Now that spring is approaching, the suffering of the poor has not yet been relieved. In order to carry out the initial intention of relief, the association has decided to continue to hold spring relief, and the porridge and mobile relief vehicles are dispatched daily in the two concessions to save the elderly, weak, and poor people on the streets.</p>
<h3>The Donation to Ban Superstitious Items Does Not Conflict with Religious Beliefs; The Survey in the Concession Has Been Completed; Taxation Can Begin After the City's Entire Survey Is Completed</h3>
<p>After the establishment of the Preparatory Office for the Donation of Superstitious Business Items of the Municipal Finance Bureau, the outside world has slightly misunderstood, thinking that it conflicts with religion. A reporter from the Shenwen News Agency specifically visited the Preparatory Office Director Nan Ping. According to the conversation, the explanation of the relationship between the office and religion was quite detailed. According to Yun: "Since the establishment of this preparatory office under the order, those who do not know the truth in the outside world often think that this office conflicts with religion. However, the establishment of this office does not conflict with religion at all. People have their own freedom to believe in religion. What this office wants to ban in the future is not the belief in religion, but superstition. Therefore, the scope of the donation is only limited to those who engage in business in the form or name of religion. If any party has consultation and other matters, they can contact this office." According to the person in charge of the survey department, since the survey work of the department has begun, it has successively completed the survey of Nanshi, Husi, the French Concession, and part of the Public Concession. The rest, such as Hongkou, Yangshupu, Jiading, Pudong, Chongming, etc., are also scheduled to begin the survey within days. Once the entire survey work is completed, taxation can begin.</p>
<h3>Coal Stock Registration Completed; Totaling 14,000 Tons; Creating a Table to Report to the Coal Association; Unregistered Coal Stocks Are Not Allowed to Be Moved</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Association, in order to maintain the stability of the fuel market in Shanghai for a long time, sent a letter to Da Zhong Lian Coal Company at the end of last month, entrusting the company to handle the registration of coal stocks. The company has been handling it for more than ten days since it was entrusted to start, and it has been completed by the deadline of the 10th of this month. Yesterday, the statistics were completed, and the total amount of registered coal reached 14,848 tons and 487. Now the company has created statistics on the registration process and sent them to the Shanghai Coal Association for reference.</p>
<p>Tiered Registration</p>
<p>Yesterday, reporters from the Shanghai News Agency learned that the coal stock registration handled by Da Zhong Lian Coal Company this time was divided into three tiers, including coal briquette factories, fellow traders, and retailers. However, the types of coal are very diverse, but bituminous coal, white coal blocks, and chips are all included. The number of companies and the amount of coal stocks in the three tiers are listed as follows: (1) Three coal briquette factories, with 1,034 tons and 86; (2) Fourteen fellow traders, with 9,750 tons; (3) Twenty-nine retailers, with 4,63 tons and 627.</p>
<p>Reporting for Review</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to the person in charge of Da Zhong Lian Coal Company, the company was entrusted by the Shanghai Coal Association to handle the coal stock registration again, and also sent letters to the Shanghai Coal Retailers Association, coal briquette factories, fellow traders, and other companies, requiring all fellow traders to re-register all their coal stocks, regardless of bituminous, white, block, or chips, within the deadline. Now the company has created a report on the process and reported it to the Coal Association. If the coal stocks are not registered, they will not be allowed to be moved in the future.</p>
<h3>This Year's Alcohol Consumption Reaches 30 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>The Wine Industry Association of this city, in order to clarify the purpose of the association, made a statement to reporters yesterday afternoon, stating that the wine industry in Shanghai has never had a unified organization. After the establishment of the association, it plans to contact various industries to handle matters related to alcohol allocation.

<h3>Rickshaw Pullers at the North Station Entice Merchants and Seize Opportunities to Rob; Pulled to Remote Places, Accomplices Conspired; Impersonated Police Officers to Search and Rob Personal Belongings</h3>
<p>Yang Xiaoqi, a rickshaw puller from Jiangbei, is only nineteen years old. Recently, he had a whimsical idea to collude with Xiao Long, who is at large and also a rickshaw puller. They specialize in soliciting passengers at the North Railway Station, all of whom are merchants from other cities such as Zhenjiang and Xuzhou. They do not know the route in Shanghai. The gangsters took the opportunity to deliberately pull these merchants to remote places, and on the pretext of having accomplices impersonate inspectors from the police agencies to search for contraband or citizen IDs, they robbed personal belongings and fled separately. On the afternoon of the 23rd of last month, at 9:30 pm, Yang Xiaoqi pulled a passenger, Yuan Yangchong, from Zhenjiang to a remote place on Feilun Road. Xiao Long, together with Dai, searched for a citizen ID in front of him.</p>

<h3>Police in the Two Concessions Are Planning to Eradicate Pickpocketing Activities; Detailed Measures Will Be Drafted and Promulgated</h3>
<p>In order to stabilize local order, the police in the two concessions have implemented various measures to eliminate pickpocketing activities. According to a Datong News Agency reporter, the police are now planning to completely eradicate these petty thieves. The new system for licensing bicycles recently implemented is an example of eradicating the activities of bicycle thieves. However, the authorities believe that bicycle thieves are only one type of thief, so they are paying close attention to other types of thieves. It is also heard that in the near future, they may promulgate and implement similar measures to the new licensing system to eliminate petty thieves.</p>
<h3>The Western Football League Group A Game Was Held Yesterday; Lianyi Won Over the Saint Team; The Score Was Three to Zero</h3>
<p>The second round of the Western Football League Group A game between Lianyi and St. Francis was held at Jiaozhou Park yesterday afternoon starting at 3:30 pm. There was a large audience. Qu Yongfu of Lianyi performed well in this game, causing Fu En, the soul of the Saint team, to lose control. Sun Jinshun made the greatest contribution. Only Xu Erzhi of St. Francis was slightly active, and the rest did not perform well. Lianyi won over St. Francis with a score of three to zero, making the future of the championship even brighter. Lianyi gained the advantage of kicking off and attacked with all its might, going deep into the hinterland. W Xun broke through their encirclement in the middle and relieved the siege. After seven minutes, Zhuo Shijin got the ball and moved forward, and Li Yichen shot fiercely and scored. Lianyi took the lead in the first half with a score of one to zero. Changing the field and fighting again, St. Francis was even more unable to support. Taking advantage of Sun Jinshun's opportunity to sneak in, he crossed Greenberg, and Niu Li tried it out and actually hit the target. In less than five minutes, Gao Baozheng's time came, and he swept across at ten yards, and the Saint team's goalkeeper could not stop it, and the ball went into the net, winning with a score of three to zero.</p>

<h3>The Entire Aspect of French Vietnam (3)</h3>
<p>— A Vietnamese Person</p>
<p>(3) Cochinchina and the Four Protectorates</p>
<p>French governance of its colonies did not solely rely on military force, but rather learned from the British strategy in India, designating some areas for direct rule while preserving existing feudal or tribal governing structures like principalities and dukedoms. This allowed them to maintain a semblance of power, though only in name, and to control the populace. Thus, even though Vietnam had fallen, small courts still existed, with kings who held nominal power, complete with officials and popular support, but actual political authority rested with the French, and their role was merely to approve decisions.</p>
<p>Currently, French Vietnam is governed by a Governor-General appointed by the French government. However, the only area that is purely a French colony in name is Cochinchina, known as "Nam Kỳ" in Chinese. This includes major provinces like Saigon (formerly Gia Định), Biên Hòa, Định Tường, Vĩnh Long, Hà Tiên, An Giang, and the Côn Lôn Islands (Côn Đảo archipelago). Its total area is a mere 64,700 square kilometers, with a population of 4,616,000 (1936 census). France's direct colonization of Cochinchina has a long history. It began in 1858, during the reign of Qing Emperor Xianfeng, when a Spanish Catholic missionary was killed by the Annamese. France used the pretext of protecting Catholics and dispatched troops to occupy the Annamese capital of Huế and Tourane (Đà Nẵng) in September of that year. In February of the following year (1859), they occupied Gia Định (now Saigon) in Cochinchina. Two years later, in December 1861, they captured Biên Hòa, northeast of Gia Định. The following year, the Annamese army launched a counter-offensive against Biên Hòa but was soundly defeated. Simultaneously, Định Tường, Vĩnh Long, and the Côn Lôn Islands were also captured by French forces. Unfortunately, internal strife broke out in Annam, weakening the country's sovereignty and forcing it to submit to France. Consequently, in March 1863 (April 1863), Annam signed a treaty with France, agreeing to: (1) cede the provinces of Gia Định, Biên Hòa, and Định Tường in Cochinchina, as well as the Côn Lôn Islands, to France; (2) pay an indemnity of 20 million francs for military expenses; (3) allow French and Spanish missionaries to preach freely in Annam; (4) require French permission for Annam to cede territory to foreign countries in the future; and (5) grant French merchant ships and warships free navigation on the Mekong River. In 1867, under the pretext of "maintaining order and suppressing insurgents," the French further occupied the provinces of Vĩnh Long, Hà Tiên, and An Giang. In the spring of 1874, the French signed the Treaty of Saigon with the Annamese king, officially recognizing the six provinces of Cochinchina as French territory. Both Annam and France notified China of this treaty, but the Qing government's protest was ineffective. Thus, Cochinchina became the "French Cochinchina colony."</p>
<p>Besides Cochinchina, French Vietnam also includes four protectorates: Annam, Cambodia, Tonkin, and Laos.</p>
<p>The protectorate of Cambodia lies southwest of Annam. In ancient China, it was known as "Chenla." It has an area of 181,000 square kilometers and a current population of 3,046,000 (1936). Its inhabitants are mostly Indians who began migrating to Cambodia in the late Song dynasty, bringing with them the culture of Indian Brahmanism. During the reign of Emperor Chengzu of the Ming dynasty, it was briefly annexed by Annam. In the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, the Nguyễn clan rose to power and again incorporated it into Annam's territory. During the height of the Qing dynasty, Siam (Thailand) became powerful and vied with Annam for control of Cambodia, with the northern part falling under Siamese influence and the southern part under Annamese influence. During the Taiping Rebellion in China, the Siamese further supported Norodom as the King of Cambodia, excluding Annamese influence. When Norodom died in 1860, his two sons vied for the throne. Norodom, with the support of Siam, succeeded to the throne, while his brother Sisowath sought help from the French colonial authorities. The French Governor of Cochinchina, Bonard, seized the opportunity to expand French influence and declared Cambodia a French protectorate on August 11, 1863, employing French advisors. In July 1867, a French-Siamese treaty was signed, with Siam recognizing Cambodia as a French protectorate. France ceded the provinces of Battambang, Siem Reap, and Sisophon in northern Cambodia to Siam, and the Mekong River was established as the border between Laos and Siam. In 1904, the French ceded the provinces of Preah Vihear and Laos from Siam to Cambodia. In 1907, they took Battambang, Siem Reap, and Sisophon. On the other hand, as early as 1884, France signed a new treaty with the Cambodian king, transferring national administrative power to France, which was exercised by the French Resident-General in Cambodia. Today, though the royal family still exists, it is merely a figurehead.</p>
<p>The protectorate of Tonkin, or Northern Vietnam, is located in the northern part of Annam and borders the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan in China. It has an area of 115,700 square kilometers and a population of 8,700,000 (1926), making it the most populous region in Vietnam. From a strategic standpoint, it is a good base for encroaching upon southwestern China and competing for dominance in East Asia. Therefore, after France gained control of Cochinchina and Cambodia, it moved to seize Tonkin. In December 1873, France sent troops from Cochinchina to Hanoi and signed a treaty with the Tonkin authorities, accepting French protection, allowing French ships to navigate freely on the Red River, and opening Haiphong and Thái Bình as trading ports. At the same time, they used force to occupy Hanoi and the area along the lower Red River. At that time, Liu Yongfu, a brave general of the Taiping Rebellion, fled to Annam with his troops after the rebellion failed and garrisoned the Tonkin region. He effectively resisted and defeated the invading French forces, killing the French commander Francis Garnier. Liu's Black Flag Army gained great renown, but the Annamese king, unaware of the true situation and lacking diplomatic acumen, signed the Treaty of Saigon on January 15, 1874, recognizing the French right to send a Resident-General to Huế (the Annamese capital) and Tonkin and accepting French protection. However, the Tonkin authorities, in cooperation with the Black Flag Army, resolutely refused to implement the Treaty of Saigon. The French were unable to navigate the Red River or preach in Tonkin, a situation that lasted for eight years. In 1882, the French government sent Henri Rivière to lead troops to attack Tonkin, drive out the Black Flag Army, and on April 25, occupy Hanoi and the area along the lower Red River. But on May 19, the Black Flag Army launched a counter-offensive, killing the French commander and wiping out the French forces. This shocked France, and the French National Assembly passed a bill allocating 5 million francs to finance an expedition to Tonkin. They sent warships to launch a large-scale attack, capturing Huế in August and forcing Annam to sign a humiliating treaty. Tonkin's administration was placed under French supervision, and Tonkin became a French protectorate.</p>
<p>The protectorate of Annam accounts for approximately one-fifth of Vietnam's total territory, with an area of 147,651 square kilometers. According to the 1936 census, it has a population of 5,656,000, second only to the protectorate of Tonkin. Annam is the heartland of Vietnam, historically serving as its political center. At its peak, its influence extended throughout Vietnam, encompassing Tonkin, Cambodia, and Cochinchina. However, after France occupied Cochinchina and designated Cambodia as a protectorate, the royal family's power declined. On December 15, 1874, unaware of the true situation, Annam signed the Treaty of Saigon with France, unknowingly falling into the status of a protectorate. Later, the Tonkin authorities, in alliance with our Liu Yongfu's Black Flag Army, repeatedly defeated the French in battle. Yet, the Annamese dynasty remained unprepared. In August 1882, French warships launched a large-scale attack, landing at Huế and forcing Annam to sign a treaty under duress. The main provisions of the treaty were: (1) Annam was to become a French protectorate; (2) France would handle Annam's foreign affairs; (3) French Resident-Generals and administrative officials would be stationed in Annam and Tonkin; (4) the province of Bình Thuận would be ceded to France; (5) Qui Nhơn, Quảng Nam, and Đà Nẵng would be opened as trading ports; (6) France would have the right to freely suppress the Black Flag Army in Tonkin; (7) customs and finances would be managed by the French; and (8) the administration of Tonkin would be supervised by the French. From this point onward, both Annam and Tonkin became French protectorates.</p>
<p>The protectorate of Laos lies west of Annam, bordering Thailand and Burma. It has an area of 231,400 square kilometers, the largest among the Vietnamese states, even larger than two Jiangsu provinces combined. According to the 1936 census, it has a population of 1,012,000, with only 4.37 people per square kilometer, making it the least densely populated region in Vietnam. Its inhabitants migrated from Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan in China over 2,000 years ago, settling along the banks of the Mekong River and the upper reaches of the Chao Phraya River. They share the same origins as the Miao, Yao, and Yi peoples of China. During the Qianlong era of the Qing dynasty, Laos was invaded and occupied by Siam, pressuring Annam. As a result, the Mekong River was established as the border between Annam and Siam. When French influence permeated Cochinchina, Laos was annexed by Siam. After France swept through Cochinchina, Cambodia, Tonkin, and Annam in 1882, it issued an ultimatum to Siam, demanding the restoration of the Lao territories that had historically belonged to Annam and requiring Siamese troops to withdraw west of the Mekong River. In 1893, France enforced its border claims by force and compelled Siam to withdraw its troops. On October 3, the so-called Mekong Treaty was signed: (1) Siam recognized all territories on the left bank of the Mekong River south of 23 degrees north latitude as belonging to Cambodia and Annam; (2) Siam agreed to withdraw all its troops stationed on the left bank of the Mekong River within one month; (3) Siamese warships were not allowed to navigate the Mekong River; (4) Siam was not allowed to build fortifications within fifteen miles of the Mekong River's banks; (5) Siam had to pay France 2 million francs in war reparations. From then on, Laos fell within the French sphere of influence. In 1896, Britain and France negotiated and signed a treaty on January 16, guaranteeing the independence of Siam, with the Mekong River as the boundary of French influence. In 1904, Britain, France, and Siam reached an agreement, extending French influence 7,800 li (approximately 3,900 kilometers) west of the Mekong River. Thus, the status of Laos as a French protectorate was established.</p>
<p>France has a colonial governor in Cochinchina and Resident-Generals in the various protectorates. The Governor-General of French Indochina, based in Hanoi, oversees the political affairs of the Vietnamese colony and protectorates. He is assisted by three bodies: the Governor-General's Council, the Resident Council, and the Supreme Council of Economic and Financial Affairs, which serve as high-level advisory bodies to the Governor-General of French Indochina. In addition, Cochinchina has a Cochinchina Council, while the other three protectorates each have a Protectorate Council. Furthermore, Cochinchina has a Colonial Council, Tonkin, Annam, and Cambodia have Economic and Financial Councils, Tonkin and Annam have People's Councils, and Cambodia and Laos have Indigenous Advisory Councils. From this, it can be seen that the French rulers largely emulate the British and American approach in their governance of Vietnam, adopting a policy of appeasement and limited democracy as a means of winning over the people.</p>

<h3>New Movement Restrictions and the Shanghai Economic Community</h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese economic community in this city has expressed concerns regarding the reform of the system of restrictions on the movement of goods and the institutions for the entry and exit of goods. In particular, the special privileges enjoyed by Japanese merchants to purchase and allocate goods in the interior have been fundamentally revised, and the Japanese side is extremely concerned about how the future trading institutions will be organized. The following are the observations of both the Japanese and Chinese sides.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants' Observations</p>
<p>We have long known that after the determination of a new policy towards China, the economy of Central China must be readjusted on the basis of a new situation. This economic reorganization is an inevitable consequence of the new policy decision. We must seek to cooperate with Chinese economists from a new standpoint, strengthen the National Government, and promote the participation of the Central China economy in the war effort. The Japanese merchants are determined on this point and will not cause any further problems. However, what is worrying is the reorganization of the institutions for the purchase and allocation of goods. Although the institutions that have been announced are ideal for the general public, how they are operated is of great importance. If they can strengthen the institutions of the National Government, then the wartime system of the Central China economy can also be promoted. Therefore, how these institutions are operated in the future is of great interest. In conclusion, the problem still lies in the issue of morality on the part of the Chinese merchants. This time, the authorities' wise decision has had a significant impact on public sentiment. The change in the perspective of the Chinese merchants indicates they are determined, and it is believed that the changes will be successfully implemented. The details of the lower-level institutions have not yet been published, so there is no need to elaborate. In short, if the Chinese merchants' awareness can be clear, then the lower-level institutions will also be sound. How to organize these institutions now is our greatest concern!</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants' Observations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Economic Community</p>
<p>Expressed appreciation for this reform of the goods control system and expressed gratitude for the goodwill of the friendly nation of Japan. Intellectuals believe that after the realization of Chinese autonomous control, China's responsibility is heavier than before. They strongly advocate that all goods purchase and allocation should be based on the principle of Sino-Japanese equality. For the sake of the complete operation of the National Commercial Control Association, they hope that Japanese economists will provide more assistance to China, which lacks experience in economic control. (Yun Peng: Translated from the Continental News on March 13)</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Expectations of the National Commercial Control Association</h3>
<p>Since the start of the war, the first major event in the Chinese economic community has been the promulgation of the "Wartime Economic Policy Outline," and the second major event has been the stipulation of the Wartime Goods Movement Control Regulations and the establishment of the "National Commercial Control Association." The former is the cause, and the latter is the result; the former is a general principle, and the latter is a specific measure. Such a measure is indeed a foundation for the implementation of the "Wartime Economic Policy Outline," because the most important conditions in the "Wartime Economic Policy Outline" are "increasing production" and "regulating prices."</p>
<p>Not long ago, the "Economic Affairs" section of this newspaper also convened a symposium with leaders of the Shanghai industrial and commercial communities to discuss prices. The results of the discussion indicated that what the people hoped from the authorities was nothing more than increasing the supply of raw materials for production, clearing the sources of goods, paying attention to control measures, and strengthening commercial institutions (see the February 27 edition of this newspaper). Only two weeks have passed, and our expectations can be said to have been fulfilled as desired. There is no doubt that such a measure is a wise move on the part of the authorities and a source of welfare for the people.</p>
<p>The restriction of goods movement and the establishment of the Control Association can originally be discussed together, because their relationship is linked. Therefore, Minister of Industry Mei said the following in his statement: "The Wartime Goods Movement Control Regulations are a temporary measure. In the future, when the lower-level organizations of the National Commercial Control Association can reach the stage of universal strengthening, the association can be fully responsible for the autonomous control of all goods movement. Therefore, it is hoped that people in all localities will understand the spirit of the government's policy and actively and automatically strengthen the organization of each industry itself." We believe that these few words are worth pondering.</p>
<p>The establishment of the National Commercial Control Association has a dual meaning: one is the expression of the authorities' trust in the people, and the other is the expression of the people's sense of responsibility to the authorities. Because the authorities resolutely entrust the power of economic control to the people, this is the authorities' trust; the people are happy to accept such a complex and arduous task without hesitation, and this is the people's sense of responsibility. When trust and responsibility are combined, they are sufficient to form sincere cooperation, sincere economic cooperation. In addition, one aspect of trust is sufficient to evoke the sense of responsibility of the other party, and one aspect of the sense of responsibility is also sufficient to strengthen the trust of the other party, so the relationship between the two is also reciprocal.</p>
<p>Standing from the perspective of the private economic sector, we only talk about the issue of responsibility. Since we have grasped the authority of national economic control, we must of course take fulfilling our responsibilities and achieving results as our primary task. It must be known that the place of authority is not necessarily the place of achievement, but the place of achievement is precisely the place of authority. This statement is not philosophy, but it is the ultimate truth.</p>
<p>We deeply know that the National Commercial Control Association will become a powerful private economic organization, and we also deeply know that the leaders of the National Commercial Control Association must be the first-class talents of the private economic community. Because of this, our expectations for this new organization are all the more eager. Our only hope is to strengthen the lower-level organizations of this new organization, and especially to pay attention to the personnel issues in the lower-level organizations. Past experience tells us that, whether in Chinese political or commercial institutions, there are often very perfect systems and very wise leaders, but only because the lower-level organizations have not been cleared and corruption has occurred, the reputation has fallen to the ground and all previous efforts have been abandoned. This is the most painful thing in the past and the thing that must be most guarded against in the future. Such a situation can be compared to a very magnificent car. The structure of the entire machine is extremely solid, and the driver's skills are extremely superb. However, because of a defect in the parts of the car's chassis—even a minor part such as a screw—the car malfunctions, and the traffic police point out that the driver is not careful. Wouldn't it be wrong? Therefore, even if the driver knows that the vehicle they are driving is a new type of vehicle, they should still be careful to check whether all the parts installed under the car are complete and whether there is any damage. Our expectations for the soon-to-be-established National Commercial Control Association are also the same, that is, to strengthen the lower-level organizations and carefully select the lower-level personnel, taking fairness, integrity, and honesty as the conditions for selecting lower-level personnel and as the subject of training lower-level personnel. The treatment can be improved, but the management must be strict. This is the prerequisite for strengthening the lower-level organizations, and it is also the prerequisite for strengthening the entire organization.</p>
<h3>Banks and Money Houses Implement Credit Tightening: Loan Terms and Discounts All Handled in Accordance with Regulations, and Extreme Care Taken in Investigation and Review</h3>
<p>After the member banks and money houses of the Banks and Money Houses Association followed the new loan methods decided by the joint meeting, tightened restrictions on loans, and avoided fueling speculation and hoarding, each bank and money house has recently been extremely cautious about all loans. At the same time, a special department-like organization has been established for investigation and review, and those familiar with the situation of each industry have been assigned to be responsible for handling: (1) investigating the business conditions and credit of each industry; (2) investigating the market prices of goods; (3) reviewing the legitimate use of the loan applicant. Loan applicants are limited to members of the industry association who have obtained a business license from the competent authority or have been registered. Goods used as collateral must prove that the holder's purpose is not to hoard for profit, and daily necessities are all rejected. Regarding loan "terms, valuations, and discounts," they are all handled in accordance with laws and regulations. As for the interest rate level, it has been adjusted to reflect market conditions, and the monthly interest rate has been appropriately increased to between 2% and 3%.</p>
<h3>Huazhong Tobacco Cooperative Notice: Qualified Wholesalers Pay Security Deposit from the 15th to the 17th of This Month, 50,000 Yuan for Class A, 30,000 Yuan for Class B</h3>
<p>Regarding the Huazhong Tobacco Distribution Cooperative's handling of cigarette distribution to cigarette shops in this city, the various preparatory procedures have been completed. The qualification review of each registered cigarette shop has also been completed. It is now learned that the cooperative has issued a notice to the wholesalers who have passed the review, instructing them to pay the "security deposit" within three days, from the 15th to the 17th of this month. 50,000 yuan for Class A and 30,000 yuan for Class B, the payment should be made to the Jiangxi Road Tobacco Industry Bank as an agent, and then exchange it for a formal receipt from the cooperative, and receive a wooden sign of "Designated Merchant", that is, a designated wholesaler, and instruct each shop to hang it in a prominent place for identification. On the 18th, the cooperative will convene a meeting of more than 280 registered members of the industry in the city at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to provide business guidelines, and then begin to handle the distribution of goods. After the distribution of goods in the future, each cigarette shop must keep detailed records of business accounts so that the cooperative can send personnel to investigate at any time.</p>
<h3>Hua Yu Bank to Establish More Branches in the Interior</h3>
<p>Hua Xing Commercial Bank transferred the right to issue banknotes to the Central Reserve Bank in January of the 30th year of the Republic of China and is active in the financial community as a purely commercial bank, guiding general commercial banks. In order to expand its business, in addition to establishing a branch in Hankou, it has also decided to expand its branches in the interior. In the past, there were only ten branches in the interior. After adding the three branches in "Hankou, Jiujiang, and Anqing" this time, it will be able to intensify the absorption of funds in the interior. At the same time, in terms of loans, it can establish close contact with the cooperatives that specialize in the purchase of agricultural products and develop all agriculture.

<h3>Rising for Three Consecutive Days, United Bank Notes Remain in Strong Demand – Hovering Around the 4 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the United Bank Note's upward trend did not stop, and demand from customers remained strong. Operators raised the price from around 3.90 yuan to the 4 yuan mark before sellers appeared, and the purchase price was also raised to 3.95 yuan, another increase of 10 cents. It has now risen for three consecutive days, a total increase of 50 cents. The retail price must be 4.05 yuan. The purchase price has also been raised to 3.80 yuan.</p>
<p>Military tickets are slightly lower. In the foreign exchange market, Japanese military tickets are slightly lower. Due to the weekend interest rates, operators have more supply than demand. Interbank trading is at 5.5523 yuan. The retail entry and exit prices for small money houses and banks are 5.556 yuan and 5.555 yuan, respectively.</p>
<p>Interest Rates Remain Stable Yesterday morning, the interest rate of the Money Houses Association remained at 18 cents, with very little change.</p>
<h3>North China to Conserve Fuel by Strictly Limiting Automobiles—Cargo Trucks Only Supply Essential Goods</h3>
<p>Peiping, March 13, Hai Tong News Agency—In order to conserve fuel, the traffic of automobiles in North China is strictly limited. Large cars used by schools to pick up and drop off students and by factories to pick up and drop off workers are still allowed to run, but only if the distance does not exceed three kilometers. Cargo trucks are only used to transport essential products.</p>
<h3>Hankou Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry Holds Industrial Technology Roundtable</h3>
<p>The primary condition after joining the war effort is to transform barren lands into productive areas. Hanyang and Wuhan, as industrial cities, particularly require development. Recognizing this, the Hankou Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry held an industrial technology expert roundtable at 3:00 PM on the sixth of this month in the Chamber's meeting room. The key discussion points were as follows: (1) Issues concerning industrial raw materials; (2) Issues concerning industrial power; (3) Issues concerning industrial capital; (4) Technical capabilities of Chinese workers and other related issues; (5) Issues concerning industrial zones and integrated industries; (6) Issues concerning industrial groups; (7) Desired assistance from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry on industrial issues; (8) Other matters. Many opinions promoting increased production were voiced during the session, yielding excellent results. (Continental News, March 20th)</p>
<p>Movement of Goods to be Handled by National Commercial Control Association</p>
<p>Following the National Defense Council's approval to establish a "National Commercial Control Association" and the formulation of wartime goods movement regulations, the control of goods in Shanghai and other domestic locations will now be managed by the National Commercial Control Association, supervised by both Chinese and Japanese officials. The recently promulgated goods movement laws by the authorities have reduced the number of items regulated compared to the past. Therefore, certain businesses that Japanese merchants previously had exclusive rights to will now be open to Chinese merchants as well.</p>

<h3>Review and Expectations for Farmers' Lives This Year</h3>
<p>— Sheng Jian</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a surge in discussions regarding economic issues, but they largely focus on industry and commerce, with little attention paid to agricultural affairs. Although some have planned or proposed developing the rural economy and encouraging financial institutions to engage in agricultural lending, no concrete actions have been reported to date.</p>
<p>The importance of agriculture to the national economy is actually greater than that of industry and commerce. Commerce is the communication and application of goods, and industry is the process of turning raw materials into finished products, both of which are only semi-productive industries. Agriculture, on the other hand, derives from cultivating the land without damaging it, truly a purely productive industry. Agriculture is a source of resources that can be used inexhaustibly.</p>
<p>Given the importance of agriculture as described above, and China being an agricultural nation, it is unfortunate that China's economic and intellectual circles offer little assistance to agriculture and are largely indifferent, leading farmers to adhere to ancient farming methods for thousands of years, with no means of improvement. Many uncultivated lands remain, and there is no way to develop them. This is not because farmers do not consider improving cultivation methods and expanding land, but because intellectual circles have not engaged in disseminating knowledge to farmers, rural education has not been developed, and economic circles have no intention of investing in rural areas.</p>
<p>Today, Chinese agriculture rarely involves collective investment; it is mostly small-family farming, with the amount of land cultivated determined by the number of people in the family. The most common are farm households with ten to twenty mu; those with over one hundred mu are extremely rare, as one person's strength can only cultivate three or four mu. Due to the inability to improve farming methods, the rural economy is very difficult. During the busy season, using old methods and tools to cultivate three or four mu of land requires working day and night, and once the busy season is over, there is nothing to do. Rural side occupations have also never been emphasized in China, and the weakness of the farmers' economy, lacking side occupations to supplement it, is a major cause.</p>
<p>Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy and cannot be ignored; it must be supported. Therefore, farmers' production and consumption must be reviewed. Today, the income and expenditure of farmers' lives are truly unbalanced. This issue is now extremely critical, more so than improving cultivation methods and expanding land, and yet it has not been noticed by the people.</p>
<p>Currently, most farm households cultivate ten to twenty mu of land. Let us now take the example of a family of three cultivating ten mu to examine their annual income and expenditure, and it will be clear that farmers' lives cannot be stable.</p>
<p>Let us now list the income and expenditure figures for the best farmland in areas like Wuxi and Changzhou, as shown below: (Calculated for Ten Mu)</p>
<p>Field Income:</p>
<p>Rice (Best harvest: roughly one dan per mu; lowest harvest: one dan per mu; average: three dan) 30 dan</p>
<p>Value (at production site price) … 5000.00 yuan</p>
<p>Wheat (six mu) 6 dan … 1500.00 yuan</p>
<p>Rapeseed (two mu) 2 dan … 1000.00 yuan</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains (two mu) … 600.00 yuan</p>
<p>Firewood (rice and wheat stalks, etc.) … 600.00 yuan</p>
<p>Total Income … 8700.00 yuan</p>
<p>Cultivation Capital:</p>
<p>Fertilizer (Infertile land requires an additional 60% increase over the following figures)</p>
<p>Soybean cake 600 jin … Current value 720.00 yuan</p>
<p>Ash and human manure 700 jin (300 self-supplied) (400 purchased) … Current value 240.00 yuan</p>
<p>Miscellaneous fertilizer … Current value 400.00 yuan</p>
<p>Total 1360.00 … Average 136.00 yuan per mu</p>
<p>Mechanical water lifting (double the cost for oxen and manual labor) … 600.00 yuan</p>
<p>Hired labor 40 workdays (excluding three for transplanting rice and harvesting rice, etc.) (and temporary hires for necessary work) … 400.00 yuan</p>
<p>Rent payment At nine dou per mu, discounted by 30% of the market price … 1575.00 yuan</p>
<p>Total Capital Expenditure … 3935.00 yuan</p>
<p>Net Profit after deducting income and expenditure … 4765.00 yuan</p>
<p>Annual living expenses for a family of three (calculated at the minimum rural living standard):</p>
<p>Rice 7.5 dan … Value 1875.00 yuan</p>
<p>Wheat 2.5 dan … Value 625.00 yuan</p>
<p>Fuel (50 yuan per month) … Value 600.00 yuan</p>
<p>Cooking oil and lamp oil (1.5 yuan per day) … Value 540.00 yuan</p>
<p>Salt … 100.00 yuan</p>
<p>Matches One small box every five days … 18.00 yuan</p>
<p>Soap bar One bar every half-month … 264.00 yuan</p>
<p>Clothing Four short cloth garments made per person per year, totaling twelve garments: one each for spring, autumn, winter, and summer … 720.00 yuan</p>
<p>Shoes and socks … 200.00 yuan</p>
<p>Farm tool repair … 340.00 yuan</p>
<p>Medical expenses … 300.00 yuan</p>
<p>Other … 720.00 yuan</p>
<p>Total 6302.00 yuan Net profit is insufficient by 1537.00 yuan</p>
<p>The above harvest figures are the average figures for current cultivation harvests, and they are extremely accurate. The month refers to good farmland where both rice and wheat can be planted; if it is cotton or mulberry land, the harvest is even less than this figure.</p>
<p>The rent payment item in the expenditure refers to those who rent land; those who own their own land only need to pay national grain tax. At most, they only need to pay 20% of the rent amount. However, farmers who own their own farmland are very rare. Many poor farmers do not pay rent; in addition to rent, they also need to pay a small rent. Farmers who have to pay a small rent often move to cities to work because they cannot afford to pay the rent.</p>
<p>Regarding the living expense item of rice, farmers are laborers, and the above figures are truly the minimum; most of them are higher than this. Furthermore, dishes are not included, as they have self-grown vegetables. However, annual sacrifices and religious superstitions, family visits, and those who cannot work such as the elderly and children are not included in the calculation. They cannot maintain their livelihood because the selling price of rice at the production site is different from the soaring price of fertilizers and daily necessities. This year, the price of rice is more than 20 times higher than the price at the time of the incident, while the price of fertilizer has reached 45 to 60 times higher, and the price of daily necessities and clothing has risen to 70 to 120 times higher. Previously, one dou of rice could be exchanged for one set of clothes, but now it requires three dou. One sheng of rice could be exchanged for three bars of soap, but now it requires 1.2 dou. The price of rice today is indeed high, but the price of other items is even higher. If no effective relief measures are devised, the rural economy this year will reach a critical juncture. The relief methods are nothing more than the following:</p>
<p>(1) Implement low-priced allocation of agricultural fertilizer.</p>
<p>(2) Improve the method of allocating daily necessities in rural areas.</p>
<p>(3) Increase the quantity of daily necessities allocated. The above points are only temporary economic relief. Half of spring has passed, and the busy farming season will arrive in a blink of an eye. The allocation of fertilizer must begin immediately. Water-lifting machines, etc., should also be modified to burn firewood. Last year's autumn drought caused dry and withered rice fields everywhere due to the lack of mechanical water-lifting.耕牛耕牛年來亦因來源絕迹，大見缺乏。In recent years, plowing cattle have also been in great shortage due to the disappearance of their sources. If these various aspects are not relieved early, not only will agricultural production not increase, but even the existing production will not be maintained.</p>
<p>The general situation of this year's farming year has been described above. The government authorities should pay attention to it, and the Shanghai economic circles with idle funds should also implement rural loans, such as purchasing water-lifting machines and renting them to farmers at low prices, which may also be one of the assistance methods. It is hoped that they will earnestly advance to lay the economic foundation of the country.</p>

<h3>The Evolution of the Pawn Industry in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Chen Xitai</p>
<p>The pawnshop industry is not only established to regulate the economy of the poor, but also one of the social economic institutions. I don't know when pawning started in our country. The author does not have time to do research. Only based on what I have seen and heard, I will briefly describe the general situation of the modern pawn industry and the evolution of the pawn industry in Shanghai over the past few decades.</p>
<p>Opening a pawnshop requires a large amount of capital to be reserved to wait for the pledge of goods. Therefore, the pawnshop is a place where wealth and goods gather, and it is also the target of thieves. Therefore, throughout the dynasties, once there was turmoil, the pawnshop would be the first to suffer. Tracing back to the Taiping Rebellion in the late Qing Dynasty, the pawnshop suffered disaster and naturally ceased to exist. After the chaos was pacified, the survivors were devastated, and people's lives were exhausted. Local authorities established public pawnshops everywhere to regulate the poor. The pawn period was stipulated to be three years, with a four-month grace period, and a monthly interest rate of 1.2%. The capital was either allocated by the provincial treasury or raised by local gentry. Subsequently, in cities with better public security, private pawnshops were established. The pawn period was the same as that of the public pawnshops, but the interest rate was mostly 1.5%. In rural towns, there were private pawnshops (acting as agents), called "receiving pawnshops." Although the term was the same as that of the public pawnshops, redemption could be made from the receiving pawnshop within two months or six months (depending on the amount of capital). After the deadline, the goods could be redeemed from the designated public pawnshop in the city, and the interest rate was 2% per month. This was because the receiving pawnshop did not have much capital. For the benefit of the people, the public pawnshops allowed merchants to open agencies in rural towns. Therefore, the interest rate of the receiving pawnshops was higher, and they were allowed to transport goods that had not been redeemed within the prescribed period to the city and re-pawn them at the public pawnshop. During this period, the pawnshop not only accepted pledges of clothes and jewelry, but also agricultural tools and agricultural products such as silk, cotton, and cotton cloth in rural towns, which was similar to today's bank warehouses. After the founding of the Republic of China, private pawnshops were once again on the decline due to constant turmoil. Before the Sino-Japanese Incident, most of the pawnshops in Nanjing, Suzhou, Yangzhou, Zhenjiang and other places were still state-owned or state-assisted private enterprises. From this, it can be seen that the pawnshop industry is important to the social economy. In Shanghai, however, things were different due to the concessions. All private pawnshops and regulations in the Chinese and concession areas still followed the old public pawnshop model, with a term of three years and four months. The interest rate was 2% per month. However, because the term was too long, the valuation was very low. For example, if the pawn capital was one yuan, after 40 months, with the addition of interest, it would increase to more than 1.8 yuan. Therefore, an item originally worth 10 yuan could only be pawned for 2 or 3 yuan. Shanghai's concessions were also places where Chinese and foreigners lived together. Ordinary working-class poor people had no valuables, let alone valuable items that could be pawned at the pawnshop. Therefore, small pledges with high interest rates in the concessions emerged. It is said that the term of the first pawns was only one month, with a period of ten days, and the interest rate was 3% per period. Later, as more and more people engaged in this industry, the industry became competitive, and the term was changed to two months, and the interest rate was reduced to 2% per period. Later, the Public Works Department began to crack down on and manage it, and it was changed to a four-month term. The interest rate was 2% per period for those below 3 yuan, and 3% per month for those above 3 yuan. Although the term was short and the interest rate was high, it was convenient for the poor, so small pawns were able to flourish until today. Among the 40-month pawnshops and the 4-month pawnshops, there was also a type of pawn that was in between. Its term was set for 18 months. The interest rate was the same as that of the pawnshops, at 2% per month. In recent years, it has been changed to 12 months. On Mingguo Road in the French Concession, at the Laobeidou intersection, there is a Yuanshun store that still hangs a high-quality sign, which is this type of pledge.</p>
<p>After the founding of the Republic of China, the situation changed faster and faster. Moreover, Shanghai was a civilized center and a prosperous place, and people competed for fashion. The term of the pawnshops was too long, and the clothes that were full of clothes became stale after 40 months, and no one patronized them. It had no choice but to gradually shorten the term to 30 months, 24 months, and 18 months. Recently, due to the rising prices of goods, it has been changed from 12 months to 8 months. In this process, the pledge has been changed from four months to six months and eight months due to the shortening of the term and the increase in the value of the pawnshop, which has caused many pledges to tend to pawnshop loans. In order to compete for business, the interest rate for pledges exceeding 5 yuan was calculated at 2% per month. For those over 10 yuan, the monthly interest rate was cheaper than that of pawnshops. Some large pawnshops also set the term to 18 months, and the interest rate was reduced to 1.4% per month to compete with pawnshops. Since the completion of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and the opening of traffic, the main station was established in Zhabei. The market in Zhabei has gradually prospered as a result. Pledges have also gradually been opened in Zhabei. Subsequently, the city wall of Shanghai County was demolished, and Nanshi was revitalized. Pledges also invaded, and pawnshops were no longer the only ones in the market. However, the value of pawnshops was low, and the value of pledges was high. The pledges were more convenient for borrowers, so they tended to go to them. Therefore, the pawnshops in Nanshi Zhabei Chinese area launched a group attack on the pledges. In the early years of the Republic of China, they filed a complaint with the Jiangsu Provincial Supervisory Agency, accusing the pledges of heavy interest and exploitation, which harmed the poor, and requested a ban. As a result, those who had already opened businesses were ordered to formulate regulations, restrict compliance with the regulations, and allow them to obtain licenses to operate normally. It was not allowed to secretly open new ones to restrict them. Therefore, on the Nanshi side, at the junction of the French Concession, the opening of pledges along the roads of the French Concession was scattered, which was a deformed phenomenon to welcome the pledges of Nanshi. When the August 13 Incident broke out, not only Zhabei Nanshi in the Chinese area, but also the Hongkou area and the edges of the concession were affected. They all moved into the central area of the concession to choose a place to resume business. Because many people were fleeing to the concession, the population was dense, and the pawn industry was also quite prosperous. Unfortunately, good times did not last long. Taking their own money to guard the goods for the pledgers, the prices of the goods skyrocketed, and the value of the currency continued to depreciate. They could not withstand the pledgers' repeated turnovers. In addition, the redemption of pledges on behalf of customers emerged. The "frames" of the pawnshops and pledges were turned almost empty by three times and four times. Therefore, when new and old currencies were exchanged, the pawnshops and pledges had to stop pawning. In order to take care of the livelihood of their partners, on the one hand, they presented to the Public Works Department to narrow the scope, shorten the term, and increase the interest rate to try to support themselves. Therefore, pawnshops changed from 12 months to 8 months. Pledges changed from 6 months to 4 months. The interest rate was increased to 6% per month. Moreover, the business hours were short due to the short capital, and the business was only open for a few hours a day. Both the owner and the partners were tired and depressed. On the other hand, they simply cut the nails and cut the iron to close the business and find another way out. That is why there is today's deformed prosperity in Nanshi.</p>
<p>During the August 13 Incident, the concession area was completely closed all around. When the war moved west, the chickens and civilians near Shanghai gathered in the refugee area of Nanshi. Because the boundary was closed and impassable, daily necessities had to be carried around the concession for pledges, which was quite troublesome. At this time, speculators contacted Japanese merchants as a background and established a trading company in the refugee area. They specialized in pledging pawn tickets, with a deadline of seven days and a grace period of three days, totaling ten days, and the interest rate was calculated as 2% of the pledge capital. Later, because the business was quite busy, more and more people engaged in this industry, so they also pledged cash. According to Japanese pledge regulations, the term was one month, and the face value of the regular ticket was also written as 2% of the pledge capital, and no interest was charged separately. (The amount of interest taken according to the pledge capital has been clearly written on the face of the ticket.) Later, when a part of the iron gate was opened, only a very small number of pledges resumed business in the refugee area. Moreover, the municipal authorities tried to revive Nanshi and specially designated Nanshi as an entertainment area. Therefore, the pledge became more and more prosperous. However, if you want to apply for a pledge license in Nanshi, according to the legal rules, you must operate according to the term of 8 months and the monthly interest rate of 2%. As for those who resumed business after the war, although they did not submit to the Social Affairs Bureau to allow shortening the term and increasing the interest rate, in fact, they have already imitated the precedent of the concession and printed an appendix on the pawn ticket saying "In this extraordinary time, the industry has agreed to set the monthly interest rate at 0% per yuan and set four full months as the expiration date" to indicate that in this extraordinary period, they could not comply with the legal rules. This is the recent evolution of the pawn industry in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>On the Communication of Chinese and Japanese Cultures …Dedicated to Mr. Hayashi Fusao with the Utmost Sincerity</h3>
<p>— Zheng Xun</p>
<p>Chinese rice can be moved to Japan, and Japanese peaches can be moved to China. However, due to differences in climate and soil, the harvest will definitely not be as good as the original, and even after years of improvement, it is difficult to avoid deterioration.</p>
<p>Whether the transplantation of plants is successful is determined by the different conditions of climate and soil. Needless to say, cultural exchange is determined by the different conditions of the historical realities of each nation. Ignoring the adaptability of climate and soil to transplant plants, there is no guarantee that it will be completely satisfactory in the future. Similarly, ignoring the historical realities of each nation and talking about cultural communication is also not guaranteed. Therefore, before discussing the communication of Chinese and Japanese cultures, we must deeply consider the national characteristics of China and Japan, the history they have experienced, and the political, economic, living, and all other states in which the people of both countries are currently.</p>
<p>There would be no Japanese culture without the historical realities of the Japanese nation, and similarly, there would be no Chinese culture far from the historical realities of the Chinese nation. However, people in the world who discuss the communication of Chinese and Japanese cultures often forget this fact. These people always think that there is a culture that can be applied to both Japan and China that transcends everything. This is the biggest illusion.</p>
<p>Political independence, economic cooperation, military alliance, and cultural communication. I think it is worth noting that cultural communication is listed together with the remaining political economy and military affairs. Because cultural issues are a part of national issues, the issue of Chinese and Japanese cultural communication must start from the historical realities of the Chinese and Japanese nations in order to explain everything else.</p>
<p>In recent years, both the Chinese and Japanese governments and the public have devoted great efforts to the work of Chinese and Japanese cultural communication. The organization of the China-Japan Cultural Association and the promotion of various undertakings, Mr. Hayashi Fusao's exchanges with the domestic cultural circles, etc., are all full expressions. Furthermore, it is said that Japanese writers' groups are preparing to establish "Literary Halls" in various parts of China in an attempt to exchange ideas between writers of the two countries and publish literary magazines, etc. These plans are all very good. However, relying solely on inviting guests, building houses, publishing magazines, etc., will still not achieve cultural communication. I hope that Japanese writers must have a deep understanding of China's historical reality.</p>
<p>Recently, I saw a record of a literary symposium by Hayashi Fusao, Kusano Shinpei, Tao Changsun, Zhang Ruogu, etc. in the Japanese Continental News. In summary, it seems that Hayashi Fusao has no understanding of the current situation of Chinese writers who are suffering in reality. Hayashi Fusao's words mean that Chinese writers should not be bound by politics and reality to create a "pure literature" that transcends these realities - he not only cannot understand Chinese literature, but his understanding of general literature is also very unreliable.</p>
<p>It is impossible to create literature far from reality.</p>
<p>The historical realities of the nation have nothing to do with these fantasies.</p>
<p>We have old people groaning under high prices, and we also have intellectual classes who feel distressed about the current political situation. We need to share their suffering and strive for a bright China in this suffering. This is our literature. Literary figures who can understand and sympathize with our journey, regardless of nationality, regardless of fame, are all our "literary friends."</p>
<p>Hayashi Fusao said: Japanese people suffer doubly, while Chinese people suffer quadruply. If Mr. Hayashi wants to be a friend of Chinese literature, then I hope that he needs to have the most profound understanding and reflection on this quadruple suffering.</p>
<h3>First Insomnia</h3>
<p>— Fang Ming</p>
<p>Every night, going back and forth twice, the corner in front of the cigarette and paper shop has become a place I pass through every day, and one I am very familiar with.</p>
<p>On the uneven sidewalk paved with square stones of different sizes, lies a tattered mat with only a few strands left. On top of it, a high pile is huddled, covered with a piece of torn hemp sackcloth, rhythmically rising and falling, sobbing. The dim light shining obliquely from the snack shops across the street makes this high, mound-like monster appear even more eerie and terrifying. This terrifying monster is something that catches my eye every night as I pass by.</p>
<p>One early evening, in the same spot, two children, around seven or eight years old and of similar age, were sitting listlessly. One, a girl, seemed slightly older. They were both squatting there, exposing two coal-black arms, their hands tucked into the pockets of their thin cotton vests. Their bodies trembled violently, their teeth chattered, and they let out intermittent, weak moans:</p>
<p>"…Mister…Miss…save…save me…so…cold…ah!…"</p>
<p>This sound was also very familiar to my ears. But this time, it pulled me back from my hurried pace and forced me to glance at them. I wanted to look longer and dig out a couple of small denomination notes from my pocket for them. But I didn't know if I had any small denomination notes left in my pocket, and time didn't allow me to linger for even a minute, or even a second. I could only cast them one last glance of farewell before leaving. When I looked back at them again, they were also staring at me, as if they understood everything, or as if they were secretly mocking my stinginess and harboring resentment towards me.</p>
<p>As usual, another evening, the sky was exceptionally gloomy. As I rushed out the door, a fierce gust of cold wind struck me in the face, making me shiver and shrink my head into my collar. When I got to the street, I realized it was snowing. The pedestrians along the road were murmuring: "It's snowing! Spring snow is colder than winter snow!"</p>
<p>In the corner in front of the cigarette and paper shop, the mound-like monster still existed, rising and falling. Specks of snow fell on the torn hemp sackcloth, the edges of the tattered mat rustling softly, mixed with the monotonous groans coming from the edge of the hemp sackcloth. The air became even more gloomy.</p>
<p>I glanced at it habitually and strode away. Because of my hurried pace, I occasionally bumped into pedestrians. Their resentful curses came from behind, and I had to ignore them.</p>
<p>The wind howled, and the cold of the deep night was especially piercing. The snow fell even harder, and a thin layer had already accumulated on the rooftops and sidewalks, and it was still falling endlessly. I struggled through the snow on my way home, almost covered in a layer of white powder. My running shoes were also soaked, making a "chih-pu chih-pu" sound as I walked, my toes were numb with cold, and my hands were immobile.</p>
<p>The snow fell thicker and thicker, and the scene before me was a blur of gray and white. There were even fewer pedestrians, and the surroundings were unusually silent, punctuated only by the monotonous sound of "sha-sha-sha-sha," accentuating the atmosphere of desolation.</p>
<p>I walked forward with my head down, and jumbled thoughts constantly occupied my mind. I unknowingly walked past the corner of the cigarette and paper shop. But suddenly, a thought popped into my head, as if I had forgotten something. I involuntarily turned around and walked back towards the corner of the cigarette and paper shop. In the dark corner, there was no longer a high, mound-like pile, only a expanse of white. I wondered where the monster had moved to. But when I got closer, the high pile was still there, but it was buried in snow and couldn't be clearly distinguished at first. Yet, I suspected it was no longer rising and falling, no longer moving, and I could no longer hear any groans. Had they fallen asleep? But even asleep, they wouldn't be completely silent and motionless. So I raised my foot and gently kicked the high pile. But it still didn't move. I suddenly felt a wave of terror and quickly turned around, lifted my feet, and ran straight back to the dormitory.</p>
<p>I lay under the covers, and the shadow of terror still flickered before my eyes.</p>
<p>"These two poor little lives, have they disappeared under the cover of white snow?" I tried to dispel these jumbled thoughts, but I couldn't. I closed my eyes tightly and tried to fall asleep, but I couldn't. I simply let myself think, let my thoughts develop endlessly.</p>
<p>"Why do they have to suffer…what crimes have they committed? …Aren't other people enjoying themselves?…"</p>
<p>"The great world writer Gorky, he spent his childhood begging and scavenging for garbage. Who can say that these two dead little lives, and all the poor wretches in Shanghai and all of China who suffer the same fate, are absolutely without talent?…"</p>
<p>The clear ringing of the bell came from the dormitory supervisor's room; it was one o'clock. Lingering thoughts still stubbornly occupied my mind and refused to leave. Sometimes it was drowsy and blurred, and sometimes the high, mound-like monster, the pitiful faces, and the weak groans and sighs… reappeared before my eyes.</p>
<p>I had my first insomnia.</p>
<h3>Sincerity and Socializing</h3>
<p>— Lin Huajie</p>
<p>I don't know whose article influenced me, but I always felt that the dispersal of a lavish banquet and the departure of the guests was a rather desolate scene; and I really dreamed of a banquet that would never end.</p>
<p>But when my profession gave me a kind of luck, a kind of luck that allowed me to attend banquets often, I began to understand how ridiculous the idea I had previously held was. (People should form their own feelings in their own lives, and should not accept the feelings that others have gained in their lives!)</p>
<p>Imagine at a banquet where cups and dishes clink and the host and guests are all happy, the host says the purpose of the banquet in a witty tone, and humbly asks for understanding: the dishes are too meager; and the distinguished guests, although eating a feast that costs a thousand gold, have not forgotten that their mouths have another use, so the conversation at the table is lively.</p>
<p>If you haven't just brought a mouth with you, you can't help but be surprised at how erudite our hosts and guests are. Words come and go in droves, from unknown places to unknown places. Although they come and go freely, the talk always revolves around certain topics: gambling, prostitution, and business.</p>
<p>But what can you say sitting at the table? With what words can you join in the fun in this lively scene? Escape? No, you can't escape; look, the host's car of words is rushing towards your station, can you let this car derail at your station? To be honest, you lack that bit of courage, so you smile.</p>
<p>Smiling is also a language, a polite language. However, when constant smiling is not an expression of emotion, but becomes a language, you understand the sadness of smiling. And your smile, just as people call that kind of banquet, is a form of socializing.</p>
<p>That's why I started to fear banquets, not because my stomach can't handle the greasiness; I'm afraid of the socializing smile that the mirror shows me. The education I received praised sincerity: but the reality of society wants you to socialize! And the ultimate price of this socializing is the loss of sincerity.</p>
<p>(Our various "families" are still talking about reading and being a person, two completely unrelated topics.)</p>
<p>Sir, I have only been out of school for one hundred and seventy-four days, maybe I have seen too little, I hope time will allow me to see a little beauty. I hope that future generations can see a little beauty: (Our society expects a lot from young people, but leaves them so little!)</p>
<h3>Squeezing and Pushing</h3>
<p>— Ling Qingnian</p>
<p>"Squeezing" means "squeezing in," and "pushing" means "pushing out." The methods are old; examples from ancient times are as common as weeds, easily picked up. Although the Compendium of Materia Medica has not listed them as effective remedies for the world, they seem to be included in The Art of War by Sun Tzu. In today's world, where "talented people emerge from every generation, each leading the literary scene for five hundred years," they have long been used to the point of extreme familiarity.</p>
<p>These are certainly not things that a common farmer can hear about. But in the suburbs of the city, according to the saying "everyone praises him, and all the people of Chu cheer him on," if some risk-taking heroes with the idea of doing business also took a bit of a Shanghai style, carrying a big rooster, packing two packages of Pyramid cigarettes, or a few pieces of Lao Xiangmao there and here, then they would be more familiar with squeezing and pushing than in the fields; otherwise, they would inevitably "lose both the lady and the troops," considering him unlucky.</p>
<p>Therefore, even in urban transportation, squeezing and pushing are becoming more popular. For example, on the tram, it's like the noisy society as a whole; to exist in this miniature society, you must learn all the skills of squeezing and pushing. First, you have to squeeze into a long line at the station. Before the tram even gets close, a torrent of people rushes towards the body of the tram. As a result, the tram doesn't crush people to death, but people have to squeeze the tram. A large string of people hangs on the front of the tram. But the people don't move forward, because there are people in front. And no one dares to wait on the footboard for five minutes, because there are also people behind them. Some people may be stout and broad-minded, so those squeezed on the left and right make him uncomfortable. So he uses both elbows, hitting people's noses; or perhaps he is a bit clumsy underfoot, so he grabs the armrest and takes full control, not allowing people to move forward.</p>
<p>Sometimes, there is a standstill for a dozen seconds, with people only moving left and right at the tram door, while the tram car is still empty. The ticket sellers really have occupational diseases; they explain their ancestry for three generations, and there are still two or three hanging on the iron gate. The tram has already started. So the heroes below who adhere to the ancient teaching of not standing under a dangerous wall can start arguing: "Pig, is this a life-saving tram?"</p>
<p>But after having the opportunity to squeeze onto the third or fourth life-saving tram, if the ticket seller still refuses to pull the iron gate, the aforementioned heroes will shout that they are being squeezed to death - this precisely shows that they are already working hard to "push." They desperately grab for a corner seat, but it doesn't work! They push people away, but other people's buttocks are flexible, while their own buttocks nonchalantly press on other people's knees. But those sitting next to them, in order to avoid being invaded, can poke with their hands, turn their bodies forty-five degrees, cross their legs, and light a cigarette.</p>
<p>So another hero is squeezed out. He can only huddle in a corner, still retaining the right to curse loudly. The entire tram car is squeezed and pushed even more fiercely. When it arrives at the station, the victor squeezes down the footboard in one go, and the hero next to him is especially envious, so he gives a cold push.</p>
<p>[The hero is] pushed under the tram wheels. - This is one of the social news data about squeezing and pushing. Very ordinary.</p>
<p>"They must seek monopoly and ascend to it, and look around to see that there is no market profit, so people all think it is cheap, and so they collect taxes on it." Who told him to take the tram? Wood, charcoal, or a tricycle wouldn't cause him to be "squeezed in" and "pushed out." This is the fault of the common people.</p>
<p>Gentlemen of ancient times would not have squeezed and pushed in such an unsightly manner. Yielding replaced extreme wickedness; although they could "squeeze in," they were still "pushed up" in the end. The Song Dynasty's Emperor Taizu of Chenqiao mutiny was a typical historical figure, and Julius Caesar of Rome was also the most intelligent. I think, rather than being "pushed out," it is more interesting to belong to "pushed up," and it does not lose the style of gentleness and kindness.</p>
<p>For example, currently, "running the market" means "squeezing in," and "closing early" certainly does not mean "pushing" customers out by force. In the end, they all "push up" the price of stockpiled goods - today's gentlemen also do not lose their gentleness and kindness, and they can be allowed to be listed outside of the base people.</p>

<p>I bitterly guard my lonely small room,</p>
<p>Annoyedly listening to the merciless chimes,</p>
<p>Calculating the passing of the year's end.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>With a heavy limp, counting the rugged stone steps, climbing upward with difficulty - this is for the sake of a dream!</p>
<p>"Ah, what a steep mountain path!" I look up in anguish -</p>
<p>A subconscious thought flashes by, hope seems to have been taken away by the mountain wind.</p>
<p>I lower my head in frustration - feeling that I have been deceived!</p>
<p>"Take a break!" Looking at the stone bench by the roadside.</p>
<p>Looking at the long journey ahead, my eyes are a little moist, but who would know: —</p>
<p>In this empty mountain wilderness, there is a traveler sobbing.</p>
<p>"This is the course of life! Be brave, go forward!" The mountain wind whispers in my ear.</p>
<p>I awkwardly move my limp foot.</p>

<p>Dreams are sweet, life is bitter.</p>
<p>The past is like passing clouds —</p>
<p>There is nothing to reminisce about.</p>
<h3>"杞憂" - A New Crisis in the Theater World</h3>
<p>— Meng Lang</p>
<p>Because of my love for theater, I make sure to watch every performance, and I haven't stopped for years, so I can be considered an old theatergoer. But in recent years, the impression of watching plays has become more and more bland, even boring! - I don't think this is a personal interest problem.</p>
<p>Can the superficial prosperity and liveliness of theatrical performances explain the natural development of its essence? The declining standards of theatrical art are a matter of ironclad fact. Because I love it too much, I would like to present my observations below for the reference of those engaged in theatrical work: - Let me state in advance that this is only a spectator's impression, and whether it is correct or not is up to the theater elders to decide!</p>
<p>"Opening a Play" First-ism</p>
<p>In fact, this is an old cliché, but now it has been revived and is becoming increasingly heated. Mainly, I think this is based on commercial requirements: what kind of plays are most popular with the audience? This is of course a prerequisite after the theater troupe is corporatized. Therefore, in order to adapt to this requirement, most playwrights condescend to follow suit, abandoning their "life faction" or "artistic faction" stubborn views, and flock to the path of "farce (Meloderama)," because only this kind of thing is written: the plot is tortuous, the plot is lively, suffering - suffering happily, dying - dying cleanly, without seeking rationality, and lacking individuality. The audience is stimulated enough, fortunately they come to seek enjoyment or vent; it is also convenient to write themselves, as long as they do their best to "be strange and unique" and "be funny"!</p>
<p>Try reading the special issues of the performances of various theater troupes. The author either praises himself, or admits his sins in advance, saying "there is no book without coincidences," just to muddle through for a living; alas, they automatically take off the sacred and inviolable signboard of dignity! Even more, they are beautifully called "horror plays," "legendary plays," or "…" Who knows that this kind of absurd and unprincipled "farce first-ism" not only cuts off the glorious history of the theater world, hinders the progress of performance and acting, and makes Chinese theater troupes fall into an abyss of no return, and can only degenerate and not develop one step further; at the same time, it may get the opposite effect of "winning the audience" - driving away the truly heartfelt supporters, so as an audience member who appreciates theatrical art, I am afraid that it will be impossible to watch a meaningful real tragedy or comedy in the future!</p>
<p>Performance "Variety Show-ization"</p>
<p>In recent years, the theater people have indeed made progress, understanding the psychology of the audience and being able to cater to their preferences. The directors are not willing to be outdone and have established their special achievements, which is: performance "variety show-ization." In Andreev's famous works, a Henan variety show actually appeared, coming and going without a trace, winning some foolish laughter from the audience! In the meantime, some animal dances are strung together, cow dances, horse dances - purely Hollywood movies' boring gimmicks. Recently, inserting Peking Opera into spoken drama seems to have become the most fashionable thing: so a cappella, inserting jokes, gongs and drums, stage rehearsals... even the bustling meeting of Confucius Temple has been moved to the stage. When the mood is up, add such a piece of Kunqu Opera or Storytelling, if they think of Shanghai Opera or Shaoxing Opera, why not insert it? I believe that in the near future, even the magic of Chinese shadow puppetry, Deng ××'s stunts, He's diabolo; solo plays, ventriloquism, or grass skirt dances, etc., have the possibility of being moved to the stage; in this way, the audience spends one price and watches many interesting variety shows, which is more economical than going to the amusement park!</p>
<p>Some people want to argue: the insertion in the play is for the needs of the plot, or to increase the atmosphere, show the background, express the identity, occupation, and hobbies of the characters in the play…! But please, the directors responsible for the performance, think quietly with their artistic conscience: is it entirely for these, and is there no intention to overstep the mark in the slightest - to cater to the audience's low-level tastes: to join in the fun, to have some flourish?</p>
<p>I do not oppose the necessary insertions in the play, because that is reasonable and has an organic effect on the play itself. What I am worried about is that this "variety show-ization" of the performance will destroy the unity and harmony of the overall mood and atmosphere of the performance, and even rob the guest of his host, replacing the artistic life of the drama itself with variety shows. - I hope I am a worrier, because this is a matter below common sense. For theater directors who have a correct understanding and rich cultivation of theater art, of course they have a plan in mind and will certainly not fall so low and humble!</p>
<p>Watching "People" Not Watching "Plays"</p>
<p>Recently, the newly emerging spoken drama has also partially been infected with the bad traditional poison of old dramas: watching "people" not watching "plays." The audience often goes to see a play because they want to see a certain actor, and if it is not him or her performing that day, they even want to ask for a refund. The emergence of this phenomenon may be because a certain actor's acting skills are superb or he or she performs seriously, so he or she has won the favor of thousands of viewers, and naturally has faith and admiration for him or her. But the fact is not always the case. "The audience of the green × Civilization play also often has similar events happen. Is this also the artistic success of the Civilization play actors? No, there are reasons for its existence. The star system or the leading role system is at work!</p>
<p>Although China's newly emerging spoken drama has only a short history of thirty years, it has always maintained its excellent tradition: there is no leading role here, and there is no star appearance. There is no distinction between the protagonist and supporting roles in the play. Everyone is a member of the performance, because it is a comprehensive art, which is essentially different from old dramas. It is a collectively created organic whole. But when it falls into the hands of merchants who believe in "money first," the situation changes. In order to sell tickets, the bosses desperately push out a few stars to attract the audience - and use their blind idol worship. Even in the most advanced theater troupes, they are also producing stars in large quantities, at least they are helping to foster the growth of the star system. The leading role openly drawing actor tax is one example. At the same time, actors themselves often have a fondness for showing off, writing articles to brag, wanting to use the likes of Mei Lanfang and Cheng Yanqiu to establish their own position. They think that it is best to climb to the star throne, so that they can gain both fame and wealth from now on!</p>
<p>If the above-mentioned tendencies continue to develop, the art of drama will be completely dismembered, lose its inherent glorious characteristics, and repeat the terrible mistakes of Civilization Plays. If a script with only a few lines of dialogue is not used, but a scene list system is used, what is the difference between this and Civilization Plays? As for the awareness of content, it has become very weak! Therefore, as an audience member who cares about it, I am deeply worried about its future development! Since I have perceived some hidden crises, I will not hesitate to say them straight out, even if it is disappointing. Fortunately, this is an occasional impression of an audience member, and whether it is correct or not, I say again, is up to the theater elders to decide!</p>
<h3>Expectations - Dedicated to Bai Mao Literary Weekly</h3>
<p>— 㕳 Xu</p>
<p>At this time, the Shen Bao opened a literary supplement, perhaps some people regard it as superfluous; at this time, let me have some expectations for literature and art, perhaps some people regard it as "太大大"; however, I am touched by the "Bai Mao" call for papers said, "The relationship between literature and art and the times is important" this statement, inevitably some sense that I want to say.</p>
<p>Literature and art is a branch of the literary department, and also a kind of art department, which no one can deny! Because she integrates the skill of text, thinking, writing, etc. In the art garden, she is also an important cultural tool that expresses the image of society and promotes social progress. Therefore, some people say: literature and art is a dagger, literature and art is a mirror, yes, she expresses the reality of society, she stabbed and criticised the dark side of the current society, and demands social progress, we must never neglect the use of this mirror!</p>
<p>But here we feel very sorry, is that the efficacy of literature and art, still only retained in its own surface, check this many years of experience and cause, the main is not due to the misunderstanding of the essence of literature and art by the general public?</p>
<p>For example, in the earliest period, the performance of literature and art, seems to be limited to the wind, flowers, snow, moon, and the people who use it to express, most of the arrogant and elegant, thinking that the effect of literature and art, but just playing with pen and ink, for their own appreciation and pleasure; such a concept passed to the later, the value of literature and art was raised to the sky in general! Most think that literature and art is not dyed with vulgarity, Qingya noble a class of people exclusive art, "May Fourth" since, this exclusive style, seems to have been slightly hit! But the exchange station seems to be a general class of literati, the form of literature and art, is the liberation of a layer of cage, but after all, only one layer, the right to use, still occupied by a few scholars, along to this day, to let him still do promotion and fortune, patting horses to express merit is not considered, even portraying, with women as the object, with women's affairs as the impression, directly expresses the decadence of the literature and art performers at this time and place: but indirectly to the society on the public security caused more customs crime, speaking of this, we should not help but call injustice for literature and art!</p>
<p>In order to adapt to the needs of the times, we strictly require the emergence of normal and healthy literature and art is very legitimate! Therefore, my expectations for Bai Mao are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Of course, it should not be a place for the emergence of this kind of elegant and erotic works, but to express the confirmed reality; a new garden of literature and art adapted to the times.</p>
<p>2. Widespread acceptance of contributions, the standard should not be limited to too high, so that she can achieve the purpose of popularization.</p>
<p>3. Accept as much as possible the opinions and submissions of all parties, we do not forget that "literature and art is to the masses!"</p>
<p>4. Accordingly, we rejoice in the founding of Bai Mao, while drawing on her development and prosperity, to open a new face for the literary and artistic circles in the future!</p>
