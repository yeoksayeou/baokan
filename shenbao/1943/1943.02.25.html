<p>社評</p>
<h3>所望於教育會議者</h3>
<p>本屆教育會議，將隨着第一次全國經濟會議及第二次全國軍事會議，於本月二十六日在首都開會了。預料在這次會議中，也必像過去的兩種會議，將制定各種方案，各種對策。赴會諸君不是敎育專家，即是敎育行政人員，想必對於當前的各種敎育問題，成竹在胸，解決有方，本已毋須我們多所喋喋。不過爲了敎育是復興建國的百年大計，赴會諸君儘管深謀遠慮，審愼周詳，而我們在老百姓的立塲上，却仍不能不貢獻一得之愚，以供參考。至少對於下列二點，我們希望諸君多所商榷，鄭重決定。</p>
<p>（二）關於教科書者：</p>
<p>我國敎科書的編印，向來採用審定制，即由出版家遵照政府公布的課程標準去編印，再經政府審定後發行。此種制度，一方面雖因出版家的自由競爭，不無浪費之處；他方面却因出版家的自由競爭，進步非常迅速。例如，內容的選擇，印刷的改良，定價的低廉，推廣的努力，無不鈞心鬥角，精益求精。因此，二十年來，我國敎科書的進步，以及輔助敎育的發展，實在不能不歸功於出版家的自由競爭。</p>
<p>自民國二十五年後，小學開始有國定本，但寨定本仍得互相並用，其目的乃在樹立一種模範制，即以國定本爲模範敎科書。倘審定本的成績不如國定本，則審定本自然歸於淘汰之列；反之，倘審定本的成續能勝於國定本，則政府將不惜工本，把國定本再加改良。如此反復求進，永無止境，直接可使敎科書的出版，愈出愈精；間接可輔助敎育的普及，愈推愈廣。這種方法，可稱最爲完善，即如日本至今也還採用這種模範制。</p>
<p>自國府還都後，中小學敎科書開始完全採用國定本。最近雖有學校用圖書審查暫行規程的公布，但第一條明明規定：「凡與初中暨高中同等學校之圖書，在國定敎科書未出版前，暫准書店或個人編著某中學校某科講義，送部審查，經審查合格，發給許可證後，方准發行，其有效時間，暫定三年；但期間未滿，是項國定敎科書業經出版，即行失效。「可知目前的審定本，只是一種補缺而已，將來當爲淸一色的國定本是毫無疑義的。於此，我們就不能不有所表示。第一，目前的國定本，不客氣的說，大都是急就章，反而不及以前的審定本；第二，國定本已經出了二年之久，而各科敎授法至今尙無一本出版，與以前審定本的能把敎授法與敎科書同時出版相比，更覺相形見絀；第三，爲了只有國定本一種，而且又是獨家印行，旣無比較，又無競爭，所以在印刷上，定價上，以及推銷上的種種不行，都是不可否認的事實。我們爲求中國敎科書的進步，爲求學生負擔的减輕，爲求敎育效率的提高，因此希望這次敎育會　能够對於本問題，有一番澈底的檢討。</p>
<p>（二）關於變更學制者：</p>
<p>學制要不要變更？究竟應該採用那種學制？類乎這些問題，在前次變申學制的時候，已經討論得很多，我們不擬再提。我們所要提出的，就是這次提議要變更學制的動機究竟何在？如果在於適應戰時的需要，那儘可增加戰時特種學校，或嘴遍的增加戰時特種訓練，固無須變更學制，因爲學制是有永久性的，而戰事是有終了的時候的。况且我們的參戰，只是保衛後方，即如這次戰爭中的各交戰國，也尙未聽聞有爲適應戰時需要而變更學制的，我們何必急急乃爾？又如果在於復興戰後敎靑，救濟失學，增加生產等等，那不妨仿照第一次世界大戰後的德國，只要大量設立職業補習學校！就有成效，也不必一定要變更學制。倘更有以爲現行學制是美國式的，我們爲了要排除英美的侵略勢力，所以連相像的學制也必須變更，那就未免太過分了。要知道我們所要排除的只是英美的侵略勢力，不是連相像的東西也都要一併排除。否則，連飛機，輪船，火車等等，也都要在肅淸之列，豈非成了大笑話！</p>
<p>話雖如此，我們並不是絕對不贊成變更學制的。不過我們以爲變更學制，並不是一件刻不容緩的急事，更不是一件簡單容易的小事，不妨等到重慶政權消滅之後，再來從長討論，也還不遲。否則，一國之內，有了兩種不同的學制，這是對於將來學生的學業上很不便的。其次，改一次學制，就得速帶改一次敎科書。一方面在戰時物資缺乏的時候，果然很不相宜。，他方面國定敎科書雖已編了兩年多，至今尙未全部編成，可見編輯工作的繫重，如果要再來一次重頭編過，那不知要到何年何月才能編成。如果改了學制而沒有敎科書，那比不改更壞，因爲不改，尙有書讀，改了；反而無書可讀。因此，我們希望出席此次敎育會議的諸君，如果討論到本問題，應請特別鄭重，不厭反復硏究；否則，將來恐怕要有不勝遺憾的結果。</p>
<p>（三）關於取締私立小學者：</p>
<p>私立小學的存在，是由於公立小學的不足，我們當然希望政府有力量，能够把國民敎育完全由政府來辦。但在政府力量還未充份的時候，那又何妨讓私立學校暫存，以補公立小學的不足呢？可是，我們聽聞有幾處私立小學最發達的地方，近來正在大規模的取締了。私立小學有辦理不善的地方，政府加以整理，指導，監督，補助，等等，那是照理應該，不成問題的。但不分皂白，只要是私立小學，一律取締，似乎就有了討論的餘地。</p>
<p>第一，政府是不是有力量在各鄉各鎭，各村各莊，都辦起適當的小學校來？是不是都已經辦了？如果還沒有，那何妨暫時省下取締私立小學的力量，先去多開幾所鄉村小學呢？第二，年來文盲與失學的人數激增。在複興建國的開始，如何掃除文盲？如何救濟失學？這些社會敎育的重要，並不亞於正規的國民敎育。政府又何妨暫時省下取締私立小學的力量，先夫多辦幾所識字學校，補習學校，和民衆圖書館呢？第三，私立小學的經費，往往出之於一家一族，一行一業。中國人向來有一種通病，就是各人自掃門前雪，不肯多做社會公益的事情，而這一些人居然肯掏出腰包來辦學校，眞是要　很不容易的了。現在忽然要加以取締，他們也許就要起一種感想，「原來又多管了閑事。」這種思想，在希望動員民衆「有錢出錢，有力出力」的時候，是有很大的影響的。因此，在這次教育會議中，我們希望對於暫緩取締私立小學的一點，也要仔細的硏究。</p>
<p>以上三點，都是我們耳聞目見的事實，而且與敎育前途都有極大的關係，諒必與會諸君，也都有同感。倘在次次會議中果能詳細討論，給我們一個圓滿的答復，那就眞是萬幸了。</p>

<h3>聖雄甘地的絕食壯舉</h3>
<p>印度的精神上領袖聖雄甘地，自去年起，因爲遭受了英國的壓迫，被困囹圊已久，這次爲決心抗英起見，實行絕食以示堅決。因爲絕食多天，身體一天一天的衰弱，已經到了氣息奄奄的時期。這種堅決行動，縱使得不到結果，但是印度全民的意志，因此血更强，一致尊崇聖雄。民意愈益激昂，恐印度全國都將陷於騷然混亂狀態之中。</p>
<p>聖雄甘地的主義和主張，在會議派中，未始沒有反對的意見，因爲他這種太理想主義的態度，離開現實太遠。但是相信印度民衆對於他這種犧牲一己爲謀大衆幸福血奮鬭的慈心，一定是感激涕淚的。</p>
<p>聖雄甘地屢次和會議派幹部衝突，但是印度三萬萬五千萬民衆依然擁護他的指導地位，這完全是精神感召的表現。過去他的絕食抗英，每次都成功。這就是英國懼怕他的精神影響力，所以總是妥協了事。</p>
<p>這次的絕食，就發生在二件特殊情形之　，其一，就是世界戰爭漩渦中，英國正處於生死關頭。英國或許還要用那種優柔寡斷的對印政策，藉此來麻醉印度人的道義感情，同時加以壓迫。其二，因爲英國强佔印度的食糧物資，將使印度人徬徨於飢饉綫上，同時印人又眼見日本大勝，因此民衆的反英章識，驟然激昂。</p>
<p>總之，英國這樣繼續壓迫下去，恐怕要想殘害聖雄甘地。果然他的存心如此，那末印度的抗英運動，必然擴大，引起波瀾，促成了撲滅英國的決心。</p>
<p>我們對於印度人的爭取獨立自由，而表示無限同情，對於年高　十四齡的聖雄甘地的悲壯決心，不禁流露萬分敬意。（雲鵬：譯自二月十九日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日靑木大東亞相、本日於衆院華北開發委員會席上、就該委員會手代木隆吉委員長所提出之兩問題、即（一）中國參戰後日政府對中日兩國根本關　採取何種態度、（二）日本交還租界及撤廢治外法權等措置、對華北開發公司及華中振興公司等國策公司、以及在華日僑之經濟活動等、似有影響、未知政府對此採取何種方針、作綜合之答覆、大意謂中日兩國根本關係、一如以往屢次說明者、乃在尊重中國之自由獨立及發揮國府之政治力、國府此次參戰後、已表明與日本同生共死、互相提携合作、遂行戰爭、擊潰英美之決意、及指導國民之方途、至此中日兩國不僅在軍事及政治上、卽在經濟等各方面互相保持完全之協力、同向完成大東亞戰爭之途邁進、換言之、即兩國間之關係至此當愈趨緊密、然中日兩獨立國間之提携協力、兩國當應互相嚴守尊重對方立塲之方針、因此國府對日之協力、各項措置、均本其本意及資任而爲其自主之行動、日本對此當不應出諸有所干涉之態度、而日本將租界交還國府及撤廢在華治外法權等。均爲尊重中國之主權及協力國府等、根據我國自發的意向而出之措置、其次、關於因日政府所採取之措置予在華日僑經濟活動上之影響一點、日本對中國之態度一如屢次說明、乃在求眞正中日提携之實現、因此法人之經濟活動、當不應有英美人固守權益及特權之思想、今後關於華北開發公司華中振興公司等、當使其積極協力中國之產業、一方面更有加以調整之必要、至此始能確立中日提携及共存共榮之基礎、同時日僑根據此新基礎、亦能確保有繼續性之飛躍發展云、</p>

<h3>南方軍政現狀</h3>
<p>南方日軍占領地的軍政施行狀態，進展極爲順利，本篇所述，爲日本海軍當局所披露之南方軍政的基本機構及其現况。</p>
<p>方針</p>
<p>占領地的軍政，因須適應各地域的實　，故其方式形態各不相同，實施軍政的根本方針，當然在統治上，在資源開發上，須加以統一處理，故陸海軍在中央有密切的聯繫，並與大東亞省的關係亦極力連絡調整，以期實施時的圓滿順利。占領地處理，及統治上重要事項，決定於大本營及政府的連絡會議。關　經濟開發上主要事項，完全經由陸海軍及關係各省在中央所組成的聯絡委員會决定。至其實施，亦以此爲基礎、處理各市所應担任之事項，即在當地，陸海軍軍政機關之間，經多方折衝而調整的事項亦甚多。例如在南方地域，因物資的偏在，於是發生地域間物資交流的問題，處理特產資源的問題，乃至運輸，交通，通信，郵政問題等。此等在整個統治開發上有相互關聯交涉的問題，經各機　從大局的觀點　以　　　　間的連絡調整，而後圓滑地實施。陸海軍無論在中央，在各地，作戰上固同心一體，即在軍政上亦密切合作。所以在占領地實施軍政的根本方針，先以完遂大東亞戰爭，從速恢復治安，加緊開發國防資源爲第一要件。同時，作戰軍隊確保就地自給，亦自屬急務。所有統治，開發各施策，完全根據此根本方針按序實施，今舉其主要者槪述如次。</p>
<p>（一）在統治上，軍政機關爲把握統治的根本，應儘量利用殘存的統治機構，土酋，原住民及民間長老中之富有誠意與聲望者應極力加以活用，以期運營的圓滑適切。同時，並尊重原有的社會組織，宗敎，民族的習慣等，儘可能的避免干涉，特別如日本人的優視等更須嚴加審愼，以便安定，把握民心。</p>
<p>（二）關於主要國防資源的獲得及開發，以得見實結爲第一　　　最　　　　，　國　　企業者的能力及經騐。因此，大部分的事業，因產業種類及規模等的不同，由中央指定各適任者委託其經營，至於特殊事業則由軍直接經營，或由國營。委託經營的事業，無論如何應以適應遂行戰爭的要求爲主眼。</p>
<p>所以委託經營的事業，對各該担當指定業者，旣不給與任何權益，亦無決定將來的所謂旣成事實的約束，祇爲通行目前遂行戰爭上的急需，且在占領地的開發建設上負重大的國家資任，立於南方一第綫期待其積極的活動，而得速舉救續。又對土著居民的經濟生活，爲完遂大東亞戰爭而無可避免之若干困難，應予忍受，在不妨害作戰軍的自給及國防資源的獲得之範圍內，設法解因戰爭而生的影響，維持最低限度的生活，並指導土著居民使澈底了解大東亞戰爭之眞義，信賴日軍。</p>
<p>（三）關於父通運輸，用最大努力以增强物資的運輸，完成港灣設施鞏屬最要，即造船，特別是木製船，亦當從速促進。</p>
<p>（四）關於文化教育的對策，除經由原有宗教，其他固有信　，乃至此會的慣習以楳段化民衆外，並從速恢復充實士　民的學校，普及技術敎育，以期振興。同時，並謀日本語及日本文化之普及，使彼等對日本產生全面的合作。</p>
<p>日本人進出的指導，在統治上亦至堪重視。日本人應具指導民族的自覺之修養，爲大和民族的一員，對土著民善加統率指導。所以渡海者應嚴予選擇，即已在當地者亦應始終善爲開導。</p>
<p>（五）關於敵產的處理，亦以完遂戰爭爲目標，妥爲活用，以資增强當前的戰力。對私人的特權，當然不再給予。</p>
<p>（六）關於通貨，當地迪貨與軍票並用，但擬早日使用代替軍票的迪貨。</p>
<p>機構</p>
<p>在海軍方面，軍政以該方面的艦隊司令長官爲最高責任者，於其下置民政府總監，專任民政之黄。</p>
<p>在民政府中，長官室之外，並置總務，財政，產業，交通土木，衛生，及法務六局。作爲地方機構。民政府下置民政部，民政部長官隸於總監之下，擔任各該管轄地域的民政。各民政部治下業已設置民政部支部於需要的地點，州知事以下的地方行政機構，目下亦　　　　　　　　　　於各地方。</p>
<p>新幾尼亞另設民政府，總監以下各職員在本年初即已在當地進出，這民政府的組織與其他民政府不同，以急速開拓新幾尼亞需第一義，置長官室，開拓局，衛生局及調查局，人選亦備加審擇。新幾尼亞爲未開發的處女地，資源的開發，極爲有望，民政府特附設有力的調查探險隊，計劃加緊實地調查。</p>
<p>同狀</p>
<p>（一）治安的概况　海軍的軍政管轄地域，很多是未開發的處女地，故其統治比較爲原始式的，在大體上仍沿襲原來的方式，各州及各土酋（州長或蘇丹）概於土著中仍就原位任命，令其，重新於各自領域內執行政務，法令如必要者僅於不得已部分加以修正適用，徵稅亦同樣繼續。</p>
<p>（二）一般民情治安極爲良好，統治上毫無不安，關於土著的生活，各地米殺的配給交流及增產，尙有努力的必要。同時，衣服類雜貨等，亦應使占領地的物資互相交流。並探集當地產生的枷楠木（譯音）的樹皮繼維，用其他方法使代用　　　　　計　　　　最近即可着手實行。</p>

<p>（五）文化關係　文化方面，大部分土著學校業已恢復授課，其他如瑪卡塞爾，傍奇爾瑪辛，安本等地，有民政部支部的城市，都開辦日本語學校，普及日本語。</p>

<h3>法租界交還在邇　滬市治權趨統一　專門人材當繼續任聘　警政方面將加强能力</h3>
<p>陳市長發表談話</p>
<p>關於交還法租界事、昨陳市長發表談話如下：「法國政府於二十三日聲明、為加强中法兩國邦交起見、決定撤消在華治外法權、及放棄各租界、余以為上海市民當與余個人同感無限之興奮、與深切之謝意、</p>
<p>上海過去雖為中國及國際最大都市之一、唯行政上以有租界之關係、不能統一、以故、雖有過去之繁榮、而治安始終成一問題、此即中外人士所引為遺憾者、</p>
<p>現在法國政府為加强中法兩國邦交起見、毅然自動撤消在華治外法權及放棄租界、行見上海市政即吿統一、警察之能力亦更加强、將來不獨上海愈更繁榮、抑亦可以消除過去美中不足之缺憾矣、</p>
<p>至於法租界內之人事、余當加以極度之注意、因服務於公董局及工部局者、或則為專門技術人才、或則積有多年之市政經驗、將來中國政府自當繼續任聘、以利大上海市政之進行、此則余所深信、而為上海市民所企望者、</p>
<p>中法邦交、素稱敦睦、今法國政府復有此舉、更可以促進兩國人士之深摯友誼、余忝為上海市長、目睹法租界之交　、誠有不勝慶幸者也、」</p>
<p>友好關係　更臻密切</p>
<p>（中央社訊）法國政府為推進中法兩國間之友好關係、隨友邦日本與我國簽訂交還租界與撤消治外法權之協定後、於昨日毅然宣布撤廢在華治權、并交還在華各地租界、一　準備就緒後、即予可諸實施、我國政府及友邦日本方面、對於法政府之賢明措置、均表好感、此間上海經濟界、亦以法當局交還租界、意義深切、過去上海金融工商業、每因租界之各種特權問題、不易充分發展、即政府財政亦有諸多不便執行之處、際此國府對英美參戰之後、法政府交還在華租界、促進我國完成統一經濟機構、關係誠屬重大、如過去我國推進一切稅政、均不能申展於租界區域、以致發生各種情形、影響國稅收入、即金融工商業亦受諸多隔膜、此後租界經政府收回後、一切戰時行政政權統一、全市金融工商各業、當在政府監督領導之下、調整組織、改善經濟機構、當可順利推進、屆時、國府稅收亦可增强效率、故本埠各界聞訊、莫不懷抱良好感想、</p>
<p>技術問題　並無困難</p>
<p>同盟社本埠訊、工部局總董圖崎、於星期二夜、招待報界時聲稱、維希政府決定放棄在華司法特權與法租界行政權、實乃對新中國誕生之一大步　、而與美英撤废其在華特權之空虛諾言、截然不同、橡美英乃為宣傳計、允棄其在華特權、實則無所喪失、法國此舉、則有明顯結果、而表示其對華之真誠友誼、故法國所　步驟非特將加緊中法與日法間之友誼關係　、且更增强國府之政治力、交還法租界所牽涉之技術問題、將順利解決、並無困難、</p>
<h3>廣田情報部長　發表談話</h3>
<p>日本大使館上海事務所、於昨（二）日下午三時、假南京路華懋飯店八樓、循例舉行招待中國新聞記者團、席間廣田情報部長、首先對於法國政府發表自動撤消在華治外法權、及</p>
<p>交還租界　之聲明、發表意見、認為此次法國政府毅然聲明撤消在外法權、及交還租界、實際上已無異承認國民政府、今後中法邦交更形密切、即在大東亞方面而言、法國乃與日本積極合作、而採取此新政策、意義非常重大、日本對此表示十二分敬意、繼對大東亞戰爭進展之情况、加以說明、由最近</p>
<p>日法關係　密切發展、日軍之進駐廣州灣、及估領雷州半島、使渝方此最後運輸據點完全被切斷、渝方所謂西北公路、在地理上而論、實對運輸上毫無價值、此無形中、使美國所採取之重點主義、企圖利用渝方攻擊日本、完全失效、再在大東亞戰局而論、美已無大規模攻擊日本之可能性、即小規模之游擊戰、其予日本損失之微小、實無一談之價值、最近日海軍飛機在澳州上空活躍、及軍事進展形勢、已完全切斷澳美之運輸綫、由此可知日本在大東亞戰爭中</p>
<p>軍事地位　之更形鞏固、且具堅定不拔之信念、隨時有防無處、準備殲滅敵軍之所謂大規模攻勢而毫無恐懼、最後論及歐戰形勢、德在攻蘇戰綫上、因戰略關係、曾稍撤退、所放棄之土地僅佔二十分之一、且此次撤退安全、保存軍力、俾隨時可以進攻、此即以退為進、因此可知關於德軍之種種謠傳、實為無稽、北非方面戰事、軸心軍亦節節勝利、總之、由事實上證明、英美反軸心之任何無稽宣傳、將不攻自破云云、</p>

<h3>禁痰罰則建議</h3>
<p>其一</p>
<p>報載工部局情報處公吿：查按照地產章程第五十一款，本局對隨地吐痰之人，得處以罰金五元，此項罰則不特在此次舉行第二屆禁止吐痰運動期內予以實施，且嗣後不論何時，當予嚴格招執行，藉以掃除隨意吐痰之惡習云云。</p>
<p>誠然，吐痰是一種絕對不道德行為，茲就陋見所及，再貢一些意見於後：</p>
<p>（一）租界衛生當局，不妨再度舉行一次禁痰運動宣傳週。在此一週內，宜出動全部人員并會同保甲自警員，加以切實宣傳。凡發現有人隨意吐痰者，宜一方面加以勸吿，一方面則勒令擦去；務使吐痰者感到擦痰的麻煩，而漸次自動禁吐。并且還應擴展至全市各大街小巷，僅僅注意各主要孔道，也是無濟於事的。</p>
<p>（二）此後則連續舉行第二屆宣傳週，在這次第二屆禁痰運動週中，凡發現仍然隨意吐痰者，則由負責人員上前加以訓斥，并沒收彼之市民證；以忌帶市民證罪，處以罰金五元，令其自往工部局取回（屆時工部局也不妨增設一部，以專司其責。）此舉不但可以禁止隨意吐痰，并能因而兼查市民證，一舉兩得，何樂不為。</p>
<p>（心遠）</p>
<p>其二</p>
<p>國人一向不注重衛生，故隨地涕吐，成為習慣；欲正其惡習，非强制不可，茍有違犯，科罰鍰五元，實不為過。但違犯者為巡捕或目警員所查得時，照章須到捕房，如若犯者適有緊急事情，請醫或乘舟車等則其損失非能估計，筆者以為罰鍰收據由工部局印就（最好二聯內須填犯者姓名地址市民證號數）發交各保甲長經管，如有違犯者，出巡捕或自警員拘至甲長處，科以罰款。發給收據，每星期由各甲長造表交保長彙齊，送至工部局，如此方能避免時間損失，雖各保甲長頻添辛勞，然為公計，想不會不願吧！（徐文白）</p>

<p>敎育與播音</p>
<p>本市敎育局長林炯庵、為中國廣播事業建設協會成立二周年紀念廣播、題為「廣播與敎育」、略云、</p>
<p>各位聽眾、前天是中國廣播事業建設協會成立二周年紀念、承上海廣播電臺的邀約來演講、兄弟是担任本市敎育行政工作的、所以願就「廣播與敎育」這一題目來講幾句話、</p>
<p>及無綫電播音的功用、它能闡揚主義國策、播送新聞音樂、以做國際宣傳等等偉大工作、它還可以廣播各種敎育節目、來增設聽眾知識、使民眾在不知不覺間、飽受敎育的薰陶、無綫電旣有這樣偉大的功效、所以世界各國都在積極的推行、並且對於敎育廣播事業、也在竭力地提倡、</p>
<p>日本的廣播事業、從民國十四年創設、十五年統一全國播音、十六年就開始國際廣播、現在無論對國內或者對國際的宣傳、都已獲得良好的成功、我現在願意把日本敎育播音的故事、也就是它的特色、擇其一二點來向各位介紹、</p>
<p>第一點、日本敎育播音過去發生最大效力的、要算無綫電早操、他們每天早晨從七點鐘到八點半鐘、播音台播送早操的口令和音樂、三次口令聲音洪亮壯肅、在播音時、民眾無論男女老幼、除了少數的在家練習外、都集合到小學校裏、聽口令音樂、一面練習體操、一面吸收新鮮空氣、所以日本男女的體魄、都很强健、有親近體操樂於體操的態度、更由於全國小學校裏每天利用無綫電早操的緣故、使得全國一千萬以上的學童、能鞏固國族意識、發揚國民精神、這樣集團訓練的敎育效果、是很值得我國設法做效的、</p>
<p>第二點、是日本敎育播音的節目、在質量方面、都極精彩、因為節目能影響社會聽眾日常的生活和思想、所以日本的政治家和社會領袖們、組織了播音節目顧問團來從事各種節目的研討和施行、</p>
<p>我國從前各地民營電台、為迎合一般聽眾低級趣味起見、往往播送些不適當的歌曲、這不但無益於民眾、而反有害於民眾、日本的廣播的節目、能投合大眾興趣、加以無綫電收音機的普遍裝置、所以全國聽眾人數、約佔全戶口百分之六十左右、他們常集了一羣男女老幼、在商店鋪戶收音機旁、側耳靜聽、當播送國內外政情消息的時候、他們更加肅靜、這足以看出友邦人民關心時事和民智發達的程度、</p>
<p>日本敎育播音、除了前面所講的特點外、還有指定的敎師時間、專門以敎員為對象、來促進敎師進修、向學校播送音樂、來陶冶國民性情等等的特點、回顧我國的播音事業、雖在民國十一年、自美商中國無綫電公司成立、就開始播音、不過中央廣播無綫電台、還是在民國二十一年才完成的、至於敎育播音事業、直到民國二十四年、敎育部才出播音、推進社會敎育和輔助學校敎育、</p>
<p>事變發生後、我國原有中央廣播事業完全停頓、上海的廣播事業大部份被渝方的勢力所操縱、他們廣播的、當然是違背國府的國策的、三十年二月二十二日、日本將上海南京漢口杭州各地所設的電臺、完全交還我國經營、政府為廣播事業的積極開展起見、才在那天特別設立了中國廣播事業建設協會、我們在這兩年來享受了協會管理各電臺好多有益的重要的廣播設施、所以這一天是值得我們紀念的、同時我們感覺到廣播與敎育的關係、非常密切、友邦日本的敎育播音、已收到很大的效果、現值我國政府與人民已步入政治經濟文化總力參戰的時代、那末今後我們應該協力敎育與播音的推進、來完成新時代的新使命、這自然是我們每個人的職責、諸位聽眾起來吧、我們起來負起各人應盡的責任、</p>

<h3>南洋各地特輯之四　馬來亞縱橫談（二）</h3>
<p>— 選民</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭以前，馬來半島的政治形態是這樣的：（一）海峽殖民地，爲直轄領　，由英國皇帝任命總督統治之。（二）聯邦州，爲保護領地，有名義上獨立的君主，而宗敎以外的行政實權則操在英籍的州長之手。（三）非聯邦州，受英籟顧問的指導，依據條約，由英國保護。舊英屬馬來的總督，除了統治央屬，保護領之外，還兼治英屬北婆羅洲，薩拉瓦克，布羅尼等地。至其行政組織如下：</p>
<p>（甲）立法：總督受立法會議之輔佐，行使立法權，但對立法會議通過的法律案，得依己意予以贊同，或拒絕，或予以保留之械限。</p>
<p>立法會議由總督及十三名官吏議員與十三中非官吏委員組織，官吏議員中有十一名爲官聯，有當然資格者，其餘二名由總督任命；非官議員中十一名依地區實行官選，其餘二名由新加坡及檳榔嶼兩會議所各推薦一名。</p>
<p>（乙）行政：中央行政，在新加坡設政府，由事務總長掌管之，總督受行政會議之輔佐，經事務總長以發布命令。總督對於裁判上認爲不重要之事項，無諮問之義務，又對會議决議事項，有否認權。地方行政方面新加坡則由海峽殖民地政府直接掌管，檳榔嶼及麻六甲爲設理事署，以署長統治之</p>
<p>行政會議的　，與立法會議相同，有官職上爲當然議員（總督以外）的六名官吏議員，二名官　議員，三名非官議員（新加坡，檳榔嶼兩商會各推薦一名，華僑代表一名），共由議員十二名組成。</p>
<p>（丙）司法：海峽殖民地的司法制度限於第一審，第二審，第三審由英國樞密院執行。最高審判廳亦受理一二兩審，在新加坡，檳榔嶼及麻六甲實行巡廻審判。而司法所管理的事務範圍極爲廣泛。高等法院之下，有地方法庭，警察法庭等。</p>
<p>以上是海峽殖民地的政治形熊，至於馬來聯邦州（保護國），包含霹靂，雪蘭峨，森美蘭彭亨四州，由海峽殖民地總督兼任聯邦的「統監」，受聯邦會議的輔佐，以任統治，並設聯邦書記官以仟關係事項之管理，討論等。</p>
<p>馬來聯邦的立法機關有聯邦會議與各州會竊。聯邦會議爲馬來聯邦的中央議會，組織似海峽殖民地的立法會議，不過在非官議會中，容許馬來人參加，祇要不超過每州一名至四名。州會議爲地方議會，由各州蘇丹英籟州長，官吏和非官議員構成，與聯邦議會相同</p>
<p>行政方面馬來聯邦的統治機關設於雪蘭峨州的吉降坡，組織與海峽殖民地大略相同。州行政的最高支配權在名義上屬於蘇丹，而蘇丹對於一切事項都與英籍州長會議，實權可說是操在英人手裏的。</p>
<p>司法制度大體以海峽殖民地爲範本，有品等法院和下級審判所。</p>
<p>此外，馬來非聯邦爲保護領性質，包含柔佛，吉打，玻璃市，吉連丹，丁加奴等五州，各州統治者在名義上爲王及土侯，而實際　籍顧問有太上皇的權威，外交權則規定由英國代主。海峽殖民地總督對上述各州亦如對聯邦相同，屬統監地位。立法，行政和司法，也抄　馬來聯邦。</p>
<p>（四）財政與金融</p>
<p>義英屬馬來的財政在海峽殖民地經濟立法會議通過，由總督決定後，再呈請英國政府批准，馬來聯邦則由聯邦會議通過，經統監決定後就可以實施，非聯邦各州的預算，由各州議會分別自決。</p>
<p>（一）海峽殖民地最近歲入出決算表（單位千美元）一九三八年度歲入歲出之內容（單位千美元）</p>
<p>（二）馬來聯邦州歲入歲出決算表（單位千美元）</p>
<p>歲入中以關稅收入爲主，約占伴數，其餘爲消責稅收人，土地及鑛山收人，電燈，電力及用水等官業收入，審判所規金等。歲出公債費，恩給退職金及賞金，醫務及保健費，土木局費，市費郵電費等。</p>
<p>（三）馬來非聯邦州財政狀况（單位千叻幣）</p>
<p>各州的歲入以關稅及消費稅收入爲最大，地租，鴉片稅收市收等次之，歲出以人事費，土木局費等　主。</p>
<p>舊英屬馬來輸出入貿易的大宗爲橡膠，錫等輸出時期不固定的商品，因此，金融界也沒有繁閑的特定時期，不過，馬來同時是南洋全域物產集散地及仲介貿易的重要據點，所以，她也成爲南洋最重要的金融中心地。而馬來的金融中心地，自然是新加坡，世界各國的金融機關，都集中於此，而檳榔嶼麻六甲吉隆坡怡保芙蓉等都是小規模的地方金融中心地。馬來的金融機關，第一，銀行英屬馬來的銀行，計有中國的六家，英國系的五家，日本某的三家，荷蘭系的二家，美法二國的各一家，共計十七家。英國系銀行　以查打銀行和滙豐銀行占有最優越的地位，他們以政府州府各種自治體金康的委托，管理地方金融之調節及匯　業務等，爲金融中心勢力，外國銀行則專營滙兌事務。茲誌大東亞戰前馬來各主要銀行如下：</p>
<p>（甲）英國系的：（一）查打銀行，公稱資本三百萬鎊，公積三百萬鎊；（二）匯豐銀行，公稱資本五千萬港幣，公積港幣二千萬元：（三）有利銀行，公稱資本三百萬磅，公積一百二十四萬九千零九十七鎊：（四）P．＆O．Banking　Corp．，Ltd，公稱資本五百萬鎊，公積一百八十萬鎊：（五）東方銀行，公稱資本二百萬鎊，公積九十萬鎊；（六）The　Cook　＆Son，Ltd，資本不譯。</p>
<p>（乙）中國系銀行：（一）四海通銀行，資本中國叻幣二百萬元，公積叻幣二百九十萬元；（二）華僑銀行，資本叻幣四千萬元；（三）利華銀行，資本叻幣一千萬元：Kwong　Mik　Selangor　Banking　Corp．，Ltd，叻幣一百萬元；（五）廣利銀行：資本不詳：（六）聯華銀行，資本不詳，此外，還有中國銀行的分行等。</p>
<p>（丙）日本系銀行：（一）台灣銀行資本一千五百萬日元，（二）横濱正金銀行，資本一億日元，公積一億二百五十萬日元；（三）華南銀行，資本二百五十萬日元。</p>
<p>（丁）荷蘭系銀行；（一）荷印商業銀行，資本一億盾，公積二千七百六十八萬七千盾；（二）荷　商業銀行資本六千五百零三萬盾，公積五百萬盾。</p>
<p>（戊）美國及法國系銀行：（一）美國Fational　City銀行，資本一億五千萬美元，公積三千萬美元。（二）法國的印度支那銀行，即東　匯利銀行，資本一億五千萬法郞，公積一億二千四百九十四萬三千三百二十七法郞。</p>
<p>補助金融機關，有海峽殖民地，馬來聯邦，及聯邦政府郵政局（郵政儲金），貼地（印度人高利貨的中流以下的主要金融機關），銀會（中小工商業者及其他中流以下的主要金融機關），當舖（多為華僑經營），信局（華僑所設，專辦家鄉匯兌款項）等，近年的郵政儲金額如下：（單位金額千美元）</p>
<p>舊央屬馬來的幣制，爲金匯本位制，據一九〇六年的貨幣法規定，叻幣六十元合英幣七鎊，即叻幣一元，合英幣二先令四辦士。一九二三年，施行新貨幣法，金幣祇爲名義上的貨幣，流通的以銀幣（數額不大），白銅幣，銅幣爲主，不足之額，代以約八成的紙幣。而倫敎市價規定賣出一元合二先令四辦士十六分之三，買進二先令三辦士三。</p>
<p>海峽殖民地發行紙幣的準備金分硬幣及有價證券兩種，前者爲叻元及英鎊，對發行額最小限度爲二分之一；後者以在英國及其殖民地發行者爲限，對紙幣發行額最少限度爲三分之一。銀行券，匯豐　行發行的鈔票，須有三分之的正貨準備。通貨的流通額如下：</p>
<h3>警方直接發給執照　自由車竊案可絕跡　如遇車輛被竊應即報告捕房</h3>
<p>公共租界當局爲防止竊車賊之活動、業於一過前、將頒發自由車執照事宜、由工部局捐務處移交與警務處直接辦理、</p>

<p>警方自於本月中旬開始發給本年度上季自由車車照以來、對於各項手續、極爲謹愼、務使將來偵查竊車案之時、得有極可靠之破案資料、茲聞每一領取車照者、須將其市民證號碼、及其所備之自由車樣式等項、逐一塡明、嗣後居民如有遭遇自由車被竊時、警方希　其能立即報吿捕房、並將其申請登記書之號碼呈明、則警務處即可轉飭各區捕房注意於此被竊之車輛影蹤，</p>
<p>嚴密佈置竊案減少</p>
<p>又悉、因警方之限定每人仍能領取一張執照、故竊車賊於竊得自由車時、遂不得小臨時向警方領取車照、而捕房即可於其領車照時細察該車輛之樣式、並詢問其購買之地點、因有上列之嚴密偵察網之佈置、警方當局表示、本埠此後可無憂於竊車案之發生、至少可較以前减少、更希望於居民者、即公衆能隨時檢舉不肖之徒之活動云、</p>

<h3>交還法租界後　上海經濟施政統一</h3>
<p>華方經濟界：對於法政府交還上海法租界，一致咸表好感，茲綜合各方意見如次：</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭爆發以來，法租界當局對於中日兩國，表示友好態度，協助接收英美等國之敵產。同時，中法工商銀行，東方滙理銀行等法方經濟機關，一致協助中儲券工作，抑平物價，及物品配給等項。是以今次宜佈交還法租界，對於本市經濟，非特不致有何變化，且因行收機構之統一，今後各項經濟施政，必能圓滑推進。</p>
<p>又訊，法國政府於二十三日發表，放棄對上海法租界之行政管理權。此舉於上海經濟上殊有良好之影響，以是本市財界人士，對於國府之今後新行政，寄予極大之期待。法租界當局，在過去雖對日方之方針表示贊同，協力統制經濟，但因其行政權有其獨立支配，是以在統制經濟方面，未能傾向一致。今次放棄租界以後，行政上之種種不便，從而消除，上海之經濟統制，必能蹄於統一。物價與物資之統制上，亦必比較可以爲合理的推進。</p>
<p>（二十四日大陸新報）</p>
<p>經濟評言</p>
<h3>上海工商聯誼會的使命</h3>
<p>中國有一句老話：「人同此心，心同此理。」人類不分種別，國別，性別，心是相同的，理也是相同的。人類復爲富於感悄者，所以中國有一句古語：「德服人者，心悅而誠服」。在同一心理之下，同一感情之中，彼此之間，似乎無事不可心照，無事不可情商。</p>
<p>因此，我們覺到上海工商聯誼會這樣一個組織，絕非是應運而生的，—或是偶然的—實際上是根據社會學的寳貴原理，並且爲適應當前的社會環境而產生，其惟一目標，在於「溝通中日工商界之意志」。所謂「意志」者，當然包括彼此間之心理與彼此間之感情。</p>
<p>國府參戰以來，中日雙方當局努力於戰時共同體制之確立，遇事採取協調的步驟，眞可謂極盡通力合作之能事，尤其在經濟方面，愈益見到此種合作精神的充分表現與透露。可是，不說經濟問題則已，否經濟問題—同時也是社會問題問的解決，單靠雙方政府當局的努力與合作。還是不够的，必须有雙方民間適當的人物，負起同樣的責任起來，彼此推誠相與，共同努力於民間經濟界千萬種問題的商討與解決。</p>
<p>所以，上海工商聯誼會的使命，與其說是溝通兩國工商界人士的悄感，莫如說是促進中日兩國民間經濟界的合作。作者願假今日上海工商聯誼會歡迎田尻公使，及矢野總領事之機會，在本報「經濟界」中，點綴這樣幾句話，藉作我們對於上海工商聯誼會的展望—展望兩國的「史家，能够把兩國民間經濟界合作的美滿成績，記錄於未來中日國交史上，成爲最光輝的一頁。</p>

<p>棉紗火柴等統稅指定爲國稅，目改爲從價徵收後，凡自國外輸入者，除由海關徵收進口稅外，均應按照統稅條例之規定，徵收統稅，其已完納統稅者，准在國內自由運銷，除轉口時海關征收關稅外，概不另征其他稅捐。關於棉紗火柴等已完納統稅之貨，不論在國境內任何區域運銷時，應附有繳納統稅之憑證隨運，違者以漏稅論云。</p>
<h3>蘇各縣商業登記　下月一日開始</h3>
<p>江蘇省政府當局鑒於事變以來，各地商業在戰亂之中，漸次復興，難免有紛亂及共他不合理現象，遂由建設廳命令各縣，舉辦商業登記，俾對各地商店數量，營業情形，物資概况，有詳確之認識，並可隨時加以監督·茲悉，建設廳方　對於該項商業登記，準備手續已大致就緒，故決定自三月一日起，各縣同時開始辦理登記，至建廳印就之大批商業登記證，亦將於日內分發各縣備用云。</p>
<h3>錢業統一　滙劃錢莊名稱</h3>
<p>錢業同業公會會員各莊向稱滙割錢莊，其未入圍者，分元亨利貞等字莊。該會於前日舉行年會時，經會員各莊之建議，凡該公會會員各莊應統一名稱爲某某匯劃錢莊，以保持數百年歷史上之滙劃錢業，當經通過照辦。所以此後凡入公會之會員莊律加滙劃」二字，以資識別。至於以前合夥組織各莊，爲遵照政府法令起見，限八月二十日以前完全改組爲公司組織。故嗣後滙劃錢莊與銀行相同，全爲公司組織云。</p>
<h3>債市忐忑　升降殊鉅</h3>
<p>公債行市，昨仍波動較鉅，人心依然恍惚不定，交易結　有限，上落則距離頗鉅，丙種初做爲七元三四角，高至八元，忽又回至五元內，再升至六元許，最後爲四元二三角，即此升降無定，足以窺人心之忐忑，漲風因此受挫，共他毗甲戊稍有行市，甲爲三元左右，戊爲一元左右，交易甚少。</p>
<h3>交通銀行　籌劃農村放款</h3>
<p>據支那情報戰，交通銀行之農村放款工作，近正在積極準備中。該行近派出農村經濟調查班兩班，前往滬杭綫京滬綫京蕪綫等地調查農村經濟情形，以爲實施放款計劃之參考。聞該行之放款方針，在於直接與合作社取得聯繫，極力排除中間人之從中取利。將來放軟工作開始實行時，該行或將另立農村放款總辦事處以司理其事，但此僅係計劃，是否設立，則尙未決定。至於放出之資金如何調達，尙在磋商中，倘形勢許可，或將發行口口云</p>

<p>橡皮工業　三三　織維工業　一一二　木材　雜業　五五此數與事變前較，工廠减少三分之二（前爲三四八五家），工人减少二分之一（前爲二十五萬人左右）。</p>
<h3>華中通貨工作底發展（四）</h3>
<p>第四，從社會政策方面看，二單位通貨制，徒對投機份子和錢莊銀號賜與不當利益，使一般民衆多花費一些寃枉佣金而已。在薪俸上，已經領舊法幣和軍票的薪水階級，雖然已經改爲儲鈔，但究竟是否根據一般市塲上底官定兌換率而改正，這實在成問題。何况在社會上，仍然有不少非用軍票消費不可的部門：在這種意義上，二單位制或二單位制，對薪水階級人物也是非常不利的</p>
<p>第五，從確立國民政府地位底觀點來看，二單位通貨制也不是一種好的制度。國民政府最近發行民國三十一年金融安定公債，這是防止通貨膨脹以圖獲得資金，又命中儲行接受各行交納的存款準備金，開始統制金融界，總會多少發生困難的吧！從澈底完成國民政府底經濟工作與奠定其地位之觀點看，也有改二單位通貨制爲一單位制底必要。</p>
<p>根據上述理由，構成華中經濟核心底和平區通貨，無論從那方面看，都在要求一單位制。在實行一單位制底塲合上，若使在華中佔有根深蒂固地位的車票，當作絕對統一通貨而與日圓結成等價，雖然也有一部份人如此主張，但按今天底客觀情形，是不應再提出作爲議顆的。但如想到我國與國民政府底關係，以及更廣汎的東亞共榮圈之最高理念時，也就覺到勢在必行。（季譯自一月二十七日東京經濟學者堀新一原著）</p>
<p>經濟講座</p>
<h3>自經濟學原理上　討論當前物價對策</h3>
<p>— 鏤塵</p>
<p>物價在經濟學名詞中，謂之物値。經濟學家認爲物値之不同，乃由於人類對於各種欲望滿足的鑑別有所不同。依據奧大利學派之基礎者門格爾氏的經濟思想，則物値與物値之衡量，皆出於主觀，且隨欲望而轉移，至於生產所費的勞力或資本數量，與物値並無直接或必要的關係。門格爾氏對於物値之說明，雖多少承認社會影響，但終視物値爲個人的現　，且認爲物値常與社會及法律分離而獨立。</p>
<p>作者以爲從理論上來討論物價—就是物値—問題，必須認淸兩個時代，就是尋常時代與非常時代—也可說平時與戰時。門格爾氏的第一類學說—就是物價是隨着個人的欲望而轉移的，—可以說無論在尋常時代，或非常時代，都是一個合理的見解。可是他所認爲物價與生產所費的勞力或資本數量並無直接或必要的關係，我以爲無論在尋常時代或非常時代，這句話總好像不是十分合理，因爲物價到底是與生產所費的勞力或資本的數量多少有些直接關係的。在尋常時代，固然如此，在非常時代，尤其如此。比仿戰時是一個非常時代，而戰時物價的高漲，在許多因素當中，可不能不把戰時生產所費的勞力與資本兩種因素，算在裏面。因爲戰時勞力的代價，是隨着工人生活指數的向上，而增加的，而戰時資本的代價，也是隨着物資價格估計的向上而增高的。</p>
<p>從門格爾氏的第二類學說來講—就是物値爲個人的現象，且認爲物値常與社會及法律分離而獨立。作者認爲這兩句話，確有至理存乎其中，尤其是第二句話，因爲物價在平時，就會時常與社會及法律分離而獨立，到了戰時，便會得與社會及法律分離愈遠，獨立愈甚。換一句話說，戰時物價上漲的猛烈，絕對顧不到社會的福利，同時也顧不到法律的制裁。結果，物價的漲風，乃至漫無止境，造成社會間嚴重的現象，法律上嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>從上面所申論的經濟學原理，可知在非常時期，—或是戰時—物價的高漲，可以歸納於三個主要因素：（一）因爲戰時的勞工，生活與資本代價同時增高，物價遂亦因以增高，（二）因爲物價與社會分離愈遠，物價非但不因社會環境（人民購買力的薄弱）而自抑具高漲的趨勢，抑且利用社會環境（物品需要性的增加）以助成其高漲的趨勢，（三）因爲物價與法律分離愈遠，控制物價的法律，竟常爲物價走勢所控制，結果，法律自爲法律，物價自爲物價。</p>
<p>依據剛才所說的三個主要因素，我認爲限制物價的對策—其詳細辦法，雖然是千頭萬緒的—實在可以綜合起來，成爲三個基本原則：</p>
<p>（一）自生產方面說，物價之限制，必须參考並且根據生產者的成本。限價不可不嚴，亦不可過嚴。因爲限價不嚴，則物價之價格，必　於各自爲政的局面，其中有高有低，不能獲得全面統一的限價標準，亦即商人的額外利潤所由產生。限價過嚴　則生產者鑒於成本有虧，銷售者鑒於利潤過薄，遂乃造成有料不肯製造，有貨不肯脫售的局勢，因此，限制物價，終須以物的實在成本爲根據與參考，方易收得顯著的成效。</p>
<p>（二）自社會方面說，物價的限制必須得到社會上的通力合作。與論的督促，民衆的呼號，都還在其次，最重要的是，社會自身必須根絕種種自私自利的行爲—操縱，囤積，居奇，不售等等—並且認識社會就是入民的一個組合，社會不顧物價，結果就成爲物價不顧人民。所以，社會上人士不但是要屛絕參加種種自私自利的行爲，並且要進一步的去檢舉人家這種行爲。同時，社會上的有力者，須注　於生產之鼓勵，以增加物資的來源，無力者，須注意於消費之節約，以减少物資的去路。那麼，物價自然不會有不合理的在漲。</p>
<p>（三）自法律方面說，非常時期，必有非常之法，物價儘管脫離法律，而作漫無止境之在漲，法律到底可以制裁物價不合理與不合法的上漲。統制物價，取締投機，固然是法律範圍以內的工作，即是配給制度，亦未常不是法律意義以內的行爲。講到配給制度，作者要特別提起一點，就是配給必須合理的普及與充分，方能消滅，商人壟斷居奇與人民仰給黑市的一個現象。</p>
<p>本文所討論的，並非列舉限價對策的各種詳細辦法，却想提示限價對策的幾個基本原則，希望許多縝密周詳的辦法，可以從道幾個簡單的綱領中蛻化出來，那末，所想出來的辦法，「雖不中，亦不遠矣」。，以致市氣虛弱。昨開大英脾一萬二千八百元，老刀牌一萬零七百元，品海牌八千四百元，仙女牌八千四百元，五華牌七千一百元。日烟金槍牌三千四百元，金大樓四千二百元，　玫瑰二千八百五十元，全祿牌四千零廿元、念枚三千五百元，指南牌三千四百元。國烟金字塔七千九百五十元，美麗牌七千二百元，金鼠牌四千四百五十元，白金龍四千八百元，各貨做價，軟者居多。</p>

<h3>驢豬鹿馬</h3>
<p>— 新</p>
<p>「孝武未　見　。謝大傳問曰：陛下想其形，當何所似？</p>
<p>孝武笑云：正當　猪。」（見一世設新語」。）</p>
<p>這位東晋皇帝所關的笑話，和西晋惠帝問蝦蟆的呌是爲公爲私的，眞眞是無獨有偶。</p>
<p>但孝武帝公然還知道「猪」，也可以設是一件了不起的；不過他所認議的猪或許是祭祀的時候遠遠望見的陳在牲架上的猪吧。猪去了毛，平滑血凈白，看來並不怎樣惡心，再加上牲架的高度自然也就可以騎了。</p>
<p>這個笑話也正證明全憑主觀的想傳是怎樣的靠不住。這是一種主觀主義。但另外還有一種主觀主義，卻是有意的歪曲客觀。頂有名的故事，便是趙高的一指鹿爲馬　了</p>
<p>認驢似猪是出於無智，指鹿爲馬是出於智誠的誤用。前一種的王觀主義，可以用科學的方法以療治其愚眛，後一種的主觀主義愈知道得一些科學方法，愈足以增其詭詐。同一的科學，人道主義者用之以增進人類的幸一福，極權王義者，用以殲滅宰福的人類，在這兒除掉科學的方法之外，似乎還須得有道德的力量，或政治的力量以爲後盾。</p>
<p>要克服主觀主義全靠憫人的主親的努力依然是不够的。</p>
<p>趙高在作怪，天下的鹿子都會成爲馬兒。</p>
<p>乎？猪乎？尙其次焉者矣。（酬移濟貧金）</p>
<p>科學小品</p>
<h3>漫談　「血型」</h3>
<p>— 蓬六</p>
<p>語云：一人心之不同各如其面」，然而豈僅人心不同而已，就是各人體內的血液，亦有許多不同，雖不是各如其面，確也如綜複　。</p>
<p>誰都知道血是紅的，決不會有不同，可是實際血液却有四種，任何人的血都必屬於四種中的一種，這四種、在醫學上就呌作四種「血型」或呌「血族」，它們的名稱是：A型，B型，O型和AB型。分型的根據，簡單地說，爲了有的血液中有一種成分可使他種血液凝結成團，有的却沒有，但這是醫學上的問題，不在本文範圍之內，這裏所要談的是血型的應用以及柑體質個性的關係。</p>
<p>任何人都有其一定的血型終身不變，而且亦有遺傳的關係，子女的血型必由父母的血型所決定；某型的人與某型的人結婚所生子女，必爲某幾型，不可能有具他型，所以假使知道了父母的血型就可根據遺傳原理推算出子女應有的血型和不可能有的血型，這種原理在法醫上被用以鑑別親屬關係。據作者的推測，吾國古書洗寃錄中所載「滴血騐屍」的方法亦許與此有關。</p>
<p>血型的第二種應用便是用於接血，爲了要避免血液的凝結，在接血時須　定給血者的血型。簡單地說，假使O型的人須接血，給血者必須亦是O型，A型的受血者必需A型或O型的給血者，B型的受血者必需B型或O型的給血者，而AB型受血者則任何型給血者都可給血。</p>
<p>其次要談到一些關於血型的饒有趣味的問題，根據晚近醫學界的硏究，血型不但與遺傳有關，而且還可決定一個人的體質和個性。凡是O型的人都屬於粘液質，以男子爲多，其自信力和意志力堅强，理智勝於情感，很少猶疑，不易受惑，但固執，不易融和謙讓，缺乏耐心是其缺點：這是一種英雄的品格，所以呌「英雄型」，軍人英雄大都屬此。A型的人屬於憂鬱質，在心理學上是內向性的，男女沒有顯著的差別，畏盧是　厚　離，誡　忠實，用心深遠，堅忍耐苦，富同情心及犧牲精神，但優柔寡斷，易猜疑憂鬱，所以可稱「思維型，一般科學家哲學家大都屬此。B型屬於多血質，以女子較多，心理爲外向性，行事全憑感覺，是「感覺型」，交際家，外交家，商人大都屬此；長處是磊落情快，熱試勇歌，敏捷活發，健談吐善社交，缺點是粗忽誇大，喜怒無常，易動搖，無信用。AB型是「混合型」，其體質外表爲多血質內心爲憂鬱質，兼有A型和B型的個性，所以難於捉摸，且易受環　影響而變遷。由於這種個性的關係，所以有幾位日本醫學家以爲血型對於暱業和婚姻的美滿亦有影響，但這不會因個性不同而至此，血型並不是直接的因素。</p>
<p>從上面所說，四種血型代表四種「人型」，人心雖各如其面，可亦總是各如其「血」，不出這四型之中；倘便宜各型人類能認清自己的個性捨短取長做到「完人」，那末人心各如其「面」的險惡的世道亦可變成人心各如其「人」，不用到處預防晤箭傷人了。</p>
<h3>上海歷史小掌故</h3>
<p>— 白虹</p>
<p>公共租界橋北的文監師路，如根據英文，應稱蓬恩路，所以一般人口頭上，都叫作蓬路。</p>
<p>談起這位蓬恩，他是公共租界的一個很重要的歷史人物，係美國人，業聖公會牧師。</p>
<p>當道光二十八年（一八四八年），他率領美僑，寄居於虹口一帶，並代表美政府，向上海道臺商准，即以該區爲美國租界，惟亞未劃定界址，一直到同治二年（一八六三年），乃由美領熙華德，正式與上海道合議定：沿蘇州河至黄浦江，過楊樹浦，在此範圍內，稱爲美租界。（面積比之當時之英租界大得多。）後於同年九月間，因管理問題，乃與英租界合併，稱爲公共租界，而美租界遂成歷史名詞了。</p>
<p>這是一段上海美租界的史實，而這位蓬恩也者，便是公共租界前身之一的，美租界的　設人。</p>
<p>當時他是一位十足的中國通，職務旣是聖公會傳敎的牧師，當然來往的都是中國人，所以他另外有一個中國姓名，叫「文惠廉」。大約當時的上海，此公已是婦孺皆知的了。所以後來租界當局爲紀念他的功績，便把他的名字搬到路上去了，一面英文叫蓬恩路，一面中文則寫作文監帥路，至於爲什麽牧師叫監師，也許當時的牧師名稱尙未流行，傳敎的都叫作監師，也未可知。好在我現在是介紹一些史實，牧師監師的稱謂，可以不去考究他了。</p>

<p>因僥倖而得到成功的或然率微小得幾平等於零，這就是說要想藉僥倖而獲得一件事業的成就，簡直是不可能的。世界上儘有人對於一切事物的解決，都抱着僥倖心理。他們想馮僥倖來豁免成功之路上的一切困難，因而收到事半功倍，不勞而獲的成效。正因爲如此，你瞧，世界上做出豐功偉烈的蓋世英雄歷古到今能有多少？難道許多偉人都是宿命注定他們成功偉人的嗎？不，他們全是從奮鬥努力裏掙扎出來的啊！那麽我們要成功偉人，也祇要向一個正確的目標去努力奮鬥就是了。換一句話說：凡是要成就事業，非得要憑着「一分努力，一分成就」，的原則做去不可。至於僥倖的心理，連一秒鐘的時間裏，都不計它潛入你的腦海裏才好。</p>
<p>然而因僥倖而獲得成功的人，世界上難道眞的沒有的嗎？有是有的，措乎凡是因僥倖而得到的成功，是不會有永久性的，就是他所得到的成功決不會保持到底，他之所以成功，不過是「僥倖道上」的一個逗留或段落而巳，歸根結蒂這是脫不了失敗。這無非是因爲他的成功，全乎是不勞而獲　因爲不勞，他當然從來沒有披折過一支荊棘，更沒有碰到過一　困難，所以他心目中壓根兒也不知道困難是一件什麽東西，更不曾嘗試過艱難是什麽味道，一旦稍過折磨，便全功盡棄，失收，是功虧一簣的失敗</p>
<p>上海不久以前曾經煊赫不可一世酌那些投機家，便是把僥倖抱得最牢的一班人，他們的目標是發財。的確，輕而易舉地在電話機旁嚷了一陣買進賣出，口袋裏果然鈔票便多了起來，這一條致富的捷徑，簡直是再好沒有了。可是他們的鈔蔡究竟能不能一輩子從口袋裏可以取之不竭呢？「悖進」的財貨能不能担保不久的將來不來一個悖出呢？這便是最嚴重的問題了。照我看來，他們也不過是暫時享樂而已。爲什麼？因爲他們之所以要投機，全乎是被僥倖心所促使的，經不起三朝風四朝雨，他們的一些些成就，還是要付諸東流的；不過旣經有了一些些成就，因繼績抱僥倖主義而全功　棄的人，還是比較得上一乘哩。最怕是「一出門就不利」的那些僥倖主義者，他們失收墮落後的滋味，我想還是　一位個中人來向你形客一下吧。</p>
<h3>一月分徵文錄取第五名　我的生活（上）</h3>
<p>— 余惠珍</p>
<p>人不是純然靈魂造成的無形物體，要維持軀幹的活動原力，還得藉物質的營養調劑，所以人不能超然的離開物質而生活，爲了物質，並不知坑了幾多無辜的靈魂，他們磨滅了本性，抹煞了天眞，難聞了回有的獨特的行程，而跌進庸俗的人生深淵。</p>
<p>朋友！讓我們自己來檢點一下，是否自己的生活激流亦已改變了原有的軌道。當然，誰沒有理想？誰沒有慾望。這些希望的蓓蕾父怎能離開富貴名利而獨立。所以誰都不敢大聲地說他絕對不愛富貴名利，祇是在可能的物質享受之下，不消滅他獨特的本性，不作利祿的俘虞，便已是難得的超然獨立了，夾吧，朋友！勇敢地撕下您生活史的一頁，大胆地陳述在廣大無數的陌生人羣中，不必胆怯，不必掩飾。</p>
<p>我像顆平凡的幾千倍顯微鏡下也不能瞧見的微菌，附着者雄偉高大的松幹上。終年有長靑的樹葉覆着，雨淋，風打，永遠不會摧殘到我，在這裏，我已平凡的波過了整整十九個年頭。每天，我祇要張開口，伸出手，無須顧慮生活指數的高漲，來盡我的義務；但是我坦白地承認，我的本性並不會因了生活的舒適而改變，我有個値得驕傲的父親，他不僅單純地供給孩子以物質的需要並且他懂得怎樣灌輸子女以生命的原素—精神的鍛鍊。在這偉大的父愛訓導下，使我們親切地體味到人生的快樂眞諦，使我們自動地覺察到本能的博愛精神，任何塲合，總像有一股純然愛的熱來，推動自己的生活激流，永遠維持着原有的軌道。</p>
<p>近年來爲了生活重担，父親的兩鬢幾乎斑白了。但是依然有着强健壯偉的體格，從來不在子女前提起家計的困難。我家沒有傳統的祖產，父親年少時又沒有優良的求學機會，在這遍地飢荒滿城風雨的今朝，我們十餘口的一家居然還能每日獲得正常的適當營養，對於父親堅毅放刻苦的掙扎，怎能不揭發自然的鍛練精神來。所以我沒有典型閨閣千金的嬌痴劣性，更沒有所謂大學生的應有闊綽，相反地我却儘量加添我節约的習慣，或許有人說，寒酸吧！</p>

<h3>萬世師表</h3>
<p>— Jameg　Hilton著　依今譯</p>
<p>（十七）</p>
<p>威葛特夫人出去了，到鄰村去探望親戚的；她將吃茶的東西準備好了放在桌子上，　有麵包和奶油，以及額外的杯子，以備不速之客的來到。然而在這樣的日子，客人是不大會來的；外面的霧時時在濃厚起來，大概他就只好獨自過着了。</p>
<p>可是不。大約在四點缺一刻的時候，門鈴嚮了，吉普斯親自去開了前鬥（這是他不應該做的），看見了一個較小的學生，戴着勃洛克非爾德白校帽，帶子着小心翼翼的神氣。「對不起，先生，」他說：『吉普斯先生住在這裏麽？</p>
<p>「呃哼—你還是走進來吧，」吉普斯，回答說。過了一會，在他的空內，他又說：「我就是—呃哼—你所要見的人。現在我能够—呃哼—給你做些什麽？』</p>
<p>「有人吿訴我，說你抆我，先生。』</p>
<p>吉普斯微笑着。一個老笑話—一次老騙事，大家看來，他旣然會說出那許多老笑話，他總不應該抱怨的。用他自己的笑話，來勝過他們的笑話，這是使他開心的；給他們看，甚至現在，他還不會示弱。因此他眼睛閃爍地說：「很對，我的孩子。我要你來和我喝茶。你肯—呃哼—在火爐邊坐下來麽？呃哼—我想我沒有看見過你。怎麼一回事？」</p>
<p>「我剛剛從療養院裏出來，先生—本學期開始的時候，我就在那裏患着痧子。」</p>
<p>「嘔，這就對了。」</p>
<p>吉普斯開始從谷個茶罐裏，來調合他那頗有儀式的茶；僥悻，碗櫥裏還有半塊上面糝有冰糖的胡桃糕。他問明白這孩子的名字是林福德）Linford,）住在希洛普郡（Shropshire，）他是他這一家中第一個到勃洛克菲爾德來讀書的。（四十六）</p>

<h3>What is Expected of the Education Conference</h3>
<p>The current Education Conference will convene in the capital city on the 26th of this month, following the First National Economic Conference and the Second National Military Conference. It is expected that this conference, like the previous two, will formulate various plans and strategies. The attendees are either education experts or education administrators, and they undoubtedly have well-thought-out solutions for the various current education problems. We need not belabor the point. However, because education is a century-long undertaking for national rejuvenation, even though the attendees may deliberate deeply and consider matters carefully, we, from the perspective of the common people, cannot but offer a humble opinion for reference. At the very least, we hope that the attendees will discuss and seriously decide on the following two points:</p>
<p>(2) Regarding Textbooks:</p>
<p>The compilation and printing of textbooks in our country has always adopted a review system, whereby publishers compile and print in accordance with the curriculum standards promulgated by the government, and then issue them after government review and approval. Although this system has some waste due to free competition among publishers, on the other hand, it has also led to very rapid progress. For example, the selection of content, improvement of printing, low pricing, and promotion efforts have all been areas of intense competition, striving for excellence. Therefore, the progress of textbooks and the development of auxiliary education in our country over the past twenty years cannot but be attributed to the free competition among publishers.</p>
<p>Since 1936, primary schools have begun to use national textbooks, but reviewed textbooks are still used alongside them. The aim is to establish a model system, with the national textbooks serving as model textbooks. If the performance of the reviewed textbooks is not as good as the national textbooks, then the reviewed textbooks will naturally be eliminated. Conversely, if the performance of the reviewed textbooks is better than the national textbooks, then the government will spare no expense to further improve the national textbooks. This iterative approach, seeking constant progress, directly leads to the publication of ever-improving textbooks and indirectly helps to make education more widespread. This method can be considered the most complete, and even Japan still uses this model system today.</p>
<p>Since the National Government returned to the capital, primary and secondary school textbooks have begun to exclusively use national textbooks. Although a "Provisional Regulation for the Examination of Schoolbooks" has recently been promulgated, Article 1 clearly stipulates: "Before the publication of national textbooks for junior and senior high schools, bookstores or individuals are temporarily allowed to compile lectures for a certain subject in a certain middle school and submit them to the ministry for review. Only after passing the review and obtaining a permit can they be issued, with a temporary validity of three years; however, if the national textbook for that subject has already been published before the expiration date, it will immediately become invalid." It is clear that the current reviewed textbooks are only a temporary solution, and it is undoubtedly the future trend to have uniformly national textbooks. On this, we cannot but express our views. First, frankly speaking, most of the current national textbooks are rushed jobs and are not as good as the previous reviewed textbooks. Second, national textbooks have been out for two years, but not a single teaching method book has been published yet, which pales in comparison to the previous reviewed textbooks, which were able to publish teaching methods and textbooks at the same time. Third, because there is only one type of national textbook, and it is printed by a single entity, there is no comparison or competition, so the various shortcomings in printing, pricing, and sales are undeniable facts. In order to promote the progress of Chinese textbooks, reduce the burden on students, and improve the efficiency of education, we hope that this education conference will thoroughly review this issue.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding Changes to the School System:</p>
<p>Should the school system be changed? Which school system should be adopted? These questions have been discussed extensively during the previous change to the school system, and we do not intend to raise them again. What we want to raise is: what is the motivation for this proposed change to the school system? If it is to adapt to the needs of wartime, then it is perfectly acceptable to increase special wartime schools or extensively increase special wartime training. There is no need to change the school system, because the school system is permanent, while the war will end. Moreover, our participation in the war is only to defend the rear. Even the belligerent countries in this war have not been heard of changing their school systems to adapt to wartime needs. Why should we be so hasty? Furthermore, if it is to revive education after the war, rescue those who have dropped out of school, and increase production, then it is perfectly acceptable to emulate Germany after World War I by establishing a large number of vocational supplementary schools! This would be effective, and there is no need to change the school system. If some people think that the current school system is American-style and that we must eliminate even similar school systems in order to eliminate the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States, then that would be excessive. We must understand that what we want to eliminate is only the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States, not everything that looks like them. Otherwise, even airplanes, ships, trains, etc., would have to be eliminated, wouldn't that be a big joke!</p>
<p>Having said that, we are not absolutely opposed to changing the school system. However, we believe that changing the school system is not an urgent matter that brooks no delay, nor is it a simple and easy matter. It is just as well to wait until the Chongqing regime is eliminated before discussing it at length. Otherwise, having two different school systems within one country would be very inconvenient for the future studies of students. Secondly, changing the school system once requires changing the textbooks accordingly. On the one hand, this is indeed very inappropriate at a time when wartime materials are scarce. On the other hand, although national textbooks have been compiled for more than two years, they have not yet been fully compiled, which shows the importance of the editing work. If we were to start all over again, we do not know how long it would take to compile them. If the school system is changed but there are no textbooks, that would be worse than not changing, because if it is not changed, there are still books to read; if it is changed, there are no books to read. Therefore, we hope that the attendees of this education conference will pay special attention and repeatedly study this issue carefully; otherwise, there may be regrettable consequences in the future.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the Elimination of Private Primary Schools:</p>
<p>The existence of private primary schools is due to the inadequacy of public primary schools. We certainly hope that the government has the power to have national education completely run by the government. However, when the government's power is not yet sufficient, why not let private schools exist temporarily to supplement the inadequacy of public primary schools? However, we have heard that some places where private primary schools are most developed have recently been undergoing large-scale elimination. If private primary schools are not well-managed, it is reasonable for the government to organize, guide, supervise, and subsidize them. However, indiscriminately eliminating all private primary schools seems to leave room for discussion.</p>
<p>First, does the government have the power to establish appropriate primary schools in every township, town, village, and hamlet? Has it already done so? If not, why not temporarily save the effort of eliminating private primary schools and first open more rural primary schools? Second, the number of illiterate people and those who have dropped out of school has increased sharply in recent years. At the beginning of national rejuvenation, how to eliminate illiteracy? How to rescue those who have dropped out of school? These aspects of social education are no less important than formal national education. Why not temporarily save the effort of eliminating private primary schools and first open more literacy schools, remedial schools, and public libraries? Third, the funding for private primary schools often comes from a single family, a single clan, or a single industry. Chinese people have always had a common problem, which is that everyone sweeps the snow from their own doorstep and is unwilling to do more for social welfare. It is really very difficult for these people to be willing to take money out of their pockets to run schools. Now that they are suddenly going to be eliminated, they may have a feeling that "it turns out that they have meddled in other people's business again." This kind of thinking has a great impact at a time when we hope to mobilize the people to "contribute money if they have money, and contribute effort if they have effort." Therefore, in this education conference, we hope that the attendees will carefully study the point of temporarily postponing the elimination of private primary schools.</p>
<p>The above three points are all facts that we have heard and seen, and they are all of great importance to the future of education. We believe that the attendees will also have the same feelings. If they can be discussed in detail at this conference and give us a satisfactory answer, then that would be truly fortunate.</p>
<p>Commentary and Translation</p>
<h3>Mahatma Gandhi's Heroic Hunger Strike</h3>
<p>Mahatma Gandhi, the spiritual leader of India, has been imprisoned for a long time due to British oppression since last year. This time, in order to resolutely resist Britain, he is carrying out a hunger strike to show his determination. Because of the hunger strike for many days, his body is weakening day by day, and he has reached the point of being on his last breath. This resolute action, even if it does not achieve results, makes the will of the entire Indian people stronger and more united in revering Mahatma Gandhi. Public opinion is becoming increasingly激昂, and it is feared that the entire India will fall into a state of chaos and unrest.</p>
<p>In the Congress Party, there are some who oppose Mahatma Gandhi's doctrine and claims, because his overly idealistic attitude is too far removed from reality. However, it is believed that the Indian people must be grateful and moved to tears for his compassionate heart in fighting for the happiness of the masses at the expense of himself.</p>
<p>Mahatma Gandhi has repeatedly clashed with the cadres of the Congress Party, but the 350 million people of India still support his leadership position, which is entirely a manifestation of spiritual appeal. In the past, his hunger strikes against Britain have always been successful. This is why Britain fears his spiritual influence and always compromises.</p>
<p>This hunger strike occurred under two special circumstances: First, Britain is at a critical moment in the vortex of world war. Britain may still use that indecisive policy towards India to anesthetize the moral feelings of the Indian people while suppressing them. Second, because Britain is forcibly occupying India's food and supplies, it will make the Indian people wander on the brink of famine. At the same time, the Indian people have witnessed Japan's great victory, so the people's anti-British consciousness has suddenly become激昂.</p>
<p>In short, if Britain continues to suppress them in this way, it is feared that it will want to harm Mahatma Gandhi. If that is indeed his intention, then the Indian anti-British movement will inevitably expand, causing waves and promoting the determination to destroy Britain.</p>
<p>We express our infinite sympathy for the Indian people's struggle for independence and freedom, and we cannot help but express our utmost respect for the tragic determination of Mahatma Gandhi, who is seventy-four years old. (Yunpeng: Translated from the February 19th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>The Japanese and French Authorities Conclude a Joint Defense Agreement for Guangzhou Bay / France Expresses Cooperation with Japan / Japanese Troops Peacefully Enter Chikan</h3>
<p>Xiying, 24th (Central News Agency) After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the cooperation between Japan and Vietnam became increasingly consolidated. The Vietnamese authorities have consistently cooperated fully with Japan in advancing the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. On the 21st of this month, both parties concluded a local agreement here on the joint defense of Guangzhou Bay. This is truly a page of profound significance in the history of the construction of Greater East Asia. Those present on the Japanese side included the commander of the unit, a certain army colonel, and Navy Colonel Kojima. The French representatives were Navy Captain Temok, the administrative officer of the French Guangzhou Bay concession, and Marchu, the director of the Civil Engineering Bureau. The signing ceremony was held at the administrative officer's residence at 11:15 a.m. First, Director Temok expressed his determination to cooperate with Japan and wished for the prosperity of East Asia and Japan. Then, a certain unit commander gave a speech, earnestly looking forward to the prosperity of Guangzhou Bay. Subsequently, they respectively signed the local agreement written in both Japanese and French. Japanese troops began to peacefully enter Chikan from Cunjin Bridge at 1:30 p.m. French troops also lined up to greet them in the French concession of Cunjin Bridge. The two armies greeted each other warmly, and the emotions were quite harmonious. The local people also welcomed the entry of Japanese troops with cheers.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Chu Cables French Ambassador, Thanking France for Returning Concessions / France's Understanding of the East Asian Situation Shows Wise Measures / Sino-French Relations Will Reach Friendship</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) The National Government believes that France's statement to resolutely return the administration of concessions and public concessions in China to our country and to abolish extraterritoriality is a wise measure to understand our country's position and the East Asian situation. From now on, Sino-French friendship will become closer and more friendly. To express gratitude, Foreign Minister Chu, following the instructions of the Chairman, cabled Mr. Gossmo, the French Ambassador to China in Beijing, on the 24th to express gratitude. The original telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>To His Excellency Gossmo, French Ambassador to China in Beijing, I am deeply gratified by your country's statement to abolish extraterritoriality in China and return the concessions. I hereby respectfully extend my gratitude to Your Excellency, following the instructions of the Chairman of the National Government of this country, and wish your country prosperity. Respectfully, Chu Minyi, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) The purpose of the Chinese Revolution is to seek freedom and equality for China, to raise its international status, and to seek the true liberation of the Chinese nation. The will of the Founding Father has long proclaimed that the abolition of unequal treaties and the recovery of concessions are its proper path. Although the government's policies have differed over the past thirty years, the national policy has always taken this as its starting point. Previously, friendly nations Japan and Italy took the lead in declaring the abolition of legal privileges in China, and China's international status has therefore been detached from a semi-colonial state. The formal participation in the war on January 9th was a natural measure for a truly independent and free country. This time, the French government, in order to promote the increase of Sino-French friendship, declared on February 23rd that it would abolish extraterritoriality in China and return the concessions. Sino-French friendship has thus been enhanced, and at the same time, it can further prove the friendship between the Vichy government and the Axis powers, the upward movement of China's international status, and the fact that peace is agreed upon by just nations of the world. It is also becoming increasingly clear.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) Mr. Hori, the third section chief of the Japanese Intelligence Bureau, met with the press corps today and gave a speech on the French government's decision to abolish extraterritoriality in China and return the concessions. The gist of his speech was that after China and Japan concluded an agreement on Japan's return of concessions in China and the abolition of extraterritoriality, the Italian government immediately followed Japan's policy, declaring the return of Italian concessions in China and the abolition of extraterritoriality. France has long had the same intention regarding this matter. This time, it voluntarily issued a statement and decided on the same measures. Japan's return of concessions and abolition of extraterritoriality is expected to break the unequal treaties imposed on the Republic of China in the past, so that the government status of China will rise day by day, so as to promote the establishment of a just new order in Greater East Asia. Now, the French government under the leadership of Chairman Petain has followed Italy in responding to Japan's intentions and taking this wise and decisive action. This is commendable for the Republic of China, and Japan is also pleased because it hopes for the development of the Republic of China. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, British concessions in China have already been taken over. Now, Japanese, Italian, and French concessions in China have also successively decided to voluntarily return them. Therefore, in the near future, there will be no foreign-administered concessions in the Republic of China. Italy and France hold important rights and interests in the Republic of China. Now, they have taken the lead in taking the same measures as Japan, declaring the abolition of extraterritoriality in China and returning the concessions. We further hope that other foreign countries with fewer rights and interests in the Republic of China will also take the same measures as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Shigemitsu Flies to Inspect</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) Japanese Ambassador to China Shigemitsu Kui flew to Beijing at 10:20 a.m. on the 24th to inspect the situation in North China after the National Government's participation in the war.</p>
<h3>Yuchuan Army Encircled in Mianyang Area / Minister Iwasaki Talks About the Resolution to Destroy Yuchuan</h3>
<p>Hubei Front, 24th (Central News Agency) Since the Japanese army in Central China launched its spring offensive operation in mid-February, it has been pursuing the Sixth War Zone of Yuchuan in Bailizhou in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and the northern part of the Yangtze River in western Hubei. It has completely annihilated about 30,000 people from the 118th Division of Yuchuan and other four divisions, and has achieved great results. On the 21st, the Japanese army used powerful troops to completely encircle the Yuchuan army entrenched in the area south of Mianyang and the triangular area between the Yangtze River and the Han River. That night, they launched a general offensive from all sides. The Japanese army units attacking from the southwest had advanced to Maojiakou, 30 kilometers northeast of Jianli, after smashing more than 70 large and small fortresses of the Yuchuan army. The Japanese army attacking from the east had destroyed the large fortress positions of the Yuchuan army when they advanced to the vicinity of Wenhekou, 30 kilometers southeast of Mianyang. They are now attacking a certain stronghold of the Yuchuan army. The Japanese army units attacking from the north had defeated the Yuchuan army everywhere and had advanced to the Tonghaikou area of Mianyang, pressing the remnants of the Yuchuan army towards the East Jing River. The Japanese army air force also cooperated with the ground offensive units, repeatedly bombing the Yuchuan army stronghold of Baiziqiao with large formations since the 21st. Liujiaqu (30 kilometers south of Mianyang) The Yuchuan army is in a heavy encirclement, and annihilation is not far away.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) Since the Japanese army and the National Army launched a spring offensive on all fronts in close cooperation in mid-February, they have achieved brilliant results. Mr. Iwasaki, the Minister of Press of the Japanese Army Dispatched to China, gave a speech on the 23rd on the resolution to destroy Yuchuan, roughly stating that as the Greater East Asia War approaches its third year, the dispatched army is determined to destroy the British and American air forces and the Yuchuan army in various parts of the mainland in order to complete the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, since the beginning of this year, active operations have been launched in various regions of Central and Northern China, especially the spring offensive operations launched in two areas of Central China since mid-February have been even more intense. One is the operation to destroy the Yuchuan Lu Su War Zone in northern Jiangsu Province, and the other is the annihilation war launched against the Yuchuan Sixth and Ninth War Zone Yuchuan armies in the surrounding areas of Wuhan. Currently, the expansion of the war is underway on the large battlefield spanning the four provinces of Jiangsu, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi. The elite troops of the Japanese army and the naval units are cooperating closely to dare to carry out landing operations on the Leizhou Peninsula in South China and have stationed in Guangzhou Bay in the French concession. However, the Yuchuan side must follow the old practices of Britain and the United States and send the Yuchuan army around Guangdong Province south under the pretext of Japanese invasion of French rights and interests, with the aim of defending themselves. The Yuchuan side, who are willing to be traitors to East Asia, and Britain and the United States, who have always held aggressive doctrines, will resolutely carry out annihilation operations. Since the country's participation in the war, they have stood on the same front as the Japanese army and launched active offensives against the Yuchuan army that is hindering the construction of a new China. The Yuchuan side relies solely on the activity of the American air force in China and specializes in air guerrilla warfare, attempting to counterattack and save the situation. However, the Japanese air force in China has continuously dispatched troops, exerting its fierce offensive force in the skies over the mainland, and will only stop after destroying the Yuchuan air force. This spring offensive operation is a testament to the new policies of the Japanese side towards China and strengthens and expands the political power of the National Government. It is now the time for the dispatched army to exert its courageous and hard struggle. In short, the Japanese side has always held the firm intention to destroy the British and American air forces, defeat the Yuchuan army, and eliminate the Yuchuan regime.</p>

<h3>Aoki, Minister of Greater East Asia, Clarifies Japan's Basic Policy Towards China: Cooperation in Military, Political, and Economic Matters; Moving Towards Completion of the Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Japan's Minister of Greater East Asia, Aoki, today at the House of Representatives North China Development Committee, in response to two questions raised by Committee Chairman Teshima Ryukichi, namely (1) What attitude will the Japanese government take towards the fundamental relationship between Japan and China after China's entry into the war? (2) The measures taken by Japan, such as returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights, seem to have an impact on the national policy companies such as the North China Development Company and the Central China Promotion Company, as well as the economic activities of Japanese residents in China. I do not know what kind of policy the government will adopt in this regard, made a comprehensive reply, the general meaning of which is that the fundamental relationship between China and Japan, as has been repeatedly explained in the past, lies in respecting China's freedom and independence and exerting the political power of the National Government. After the National Government joined the war this time, it has made it clear that it will live and die together with Japan, cooperate with each other, carry out the war, and defeat Britain and the United States, as well as guide the people. At this point, China and Japan not only maintain complete cooperation with each other in military and political aspects, but also in various aspects such as economy, and move towards the completion of the Greater East Asia War together. In other words, the relationship between the two countries will become closer and closer. However, in the cooperation between the two independent countries of China and Japan, both countries should strictly adhere to the principle of respecting each other's positions. Therefore, the National Government's cooperation with Japan and various measures are all autonomous actions based on its own intentions and responsibilities, and Japan should not interfere in this regard. Japan will return the concessions to the National Government and abolish extraterritorial rights in China, etc., all of which are measures taken out of respect for China's sovereignty and cooperation with the National Government, based on our country's spontaneous intentions. Secondly, regarding the impact of the measures taken by the Japanese government on the economic activities of Japanese residents in China, Japan's attitude towards China, as has been repeatedly explained, is to seek the realization of genuine Sino-Japanese cooperation. Therefore, the economic activities of legal entities should not have the idea of ​​British and Americans stubbornly defending their rights and privileges. In the future, the North China Development Company, the Central China Promotion Company, etc. should be actively cooperated with China's industry, and on the one hand, it is necessary to make adjustments. Only in this way can the foundation for Sino-Japanese cooperation and coexistence and co-prosperity be established. At the same time, Japanese residents can also ensure continuous and rapid development based on this new foundation.</p>
<p>Sato, Director-General, Adds Explanation: Sino-Japanese Relations' Broad Policy</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency Telegram) – Sato, Director-General of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Army, after Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki answered the questions raised by Committee Chairman Teshima at the House of Representatives North China Development Committee today, replied from the perspective of guiding the war, saying that the broad policy adopted by Japan towards Sino-Japanese relations, from the perspective of war, is to completely destroy the basis of Chongqing's anti-Japanese resistance. As for the spirit of Sun Yat-sen's guidance of the revolution, it was also to abolish unequal treaties and make China later leave the status of a colony. In other words, the guiding spirit of the modern Chinese national movement is to make China later difficult to be a colony and to obtain sound independence. This great cause has also been greatly successful due to the transformation of Sino-Japanese relations. This is not only a great contribution to China and Japan, but also to the history of East Asia. As for the reason why this great cause can be realized, he believes that it is due to the success and development achieved by Chairman Wang's warm efforts after returning to the capital from the National Government, as well as Japan's belief and cooperation in this. At this point, not only has the reason for Chongqing's resistance been destroyed, but also the purpose of the American war, most of its basis has also failed. During the Sino-American negotiations, Britain even rashly judged Japan's actions as aggression against sovereignty and territory by force, and attempted to exclude and monopolize it economically. However, now that Japan has adopted this broad policy, not only has it not infringed upon territory and sovereignty, but also the complete independence that the entire Chinese people have longed for since Sun Yat-sen advocated the revolution has also been realized due to Japan's cooperation. As for the economic aspect, Americans have repeatedly falsely accused Japan of exclusive and monopolistic behavior in China. Now Japan not only returns the concessions to the National Government and abolishes extraterritorial rights, but also returns the rights and interests of Britain and the United States to the National Government for management. Seeing this fact, I don't know what kind of argument Americans can make. Japan's policy towards China has completely overthrown Chongqing and the theory of the American war. This is indeed a great cause of great significance. However, it also has an impact on individuals and companies on both sides of China and Japan. In short, in order to take care of the overall situation, even if there are obstacles in the government and the military, this policy will be resolutely implemented.</p>
<h3>Tunisian Front: Fighting Temporarily Comes to a Standstill; Rommel is Now Reorganizing His Troops; It is Difficult for U.S. Forces to Take the Offensive in the Shortest Time</h3>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Haitong News Agency Telegram) – General Anderson's attempt to send troops from the British First Army in northern Tunisia to the Sarah area to rescue U.S. forces in central Tunisia has not been successful. The British army's attempt to recapture the mountain pass has also failed and has been severely damaged, losing sixty-six tanks and more than a hundred trucks in one place. Under the current circumstances, General Anderson is probably trying to consolidate the southern flank of the British First Army, without being anxious to regain the land defended by the U.S. forces. It is difficult for the U.S. forces to launch a large-scale offensive in the near future. General Rommel can consolidate new positions, build rear transportation lines, and reorganize his troops. The weather in central and northern Tunisia is bad, and military operations are greatly hindered. There is no change in the situation in southern Tunisia. General Montgomery is concentrating artillery at the Mareth Line, and it is still difficult to attack for a while.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Alliance News Agency Telegram) According to Berlin news, officials claimed last night that the offensive launched by German and Italian forces in central Tunisia eight days ago came to a temporary end on Monday after seizing an important mountain pass position. At the same time, British forces also stopped attacking the African Corps under General Rommel's command at the Mareth Line in southern Tunisia on Monday. The German army was successful in the battle in central Tunisia, capturing a total of 4,016 enemy soldiers, including more than 3,000 American soldiers. The Allied forces lost 1,053 tanks, 140 artillery pieces, 15 aircraft, 6 armored vehicles, and a large number of munitions. According to a Reuters reporter from the Allied headquarters in North Africa, the battle in the Lira area (30 miles northwest of Kasserine and 35 miles northeast of Tebessa) turned silent on Monday night. Tuesday's war report admitted that the Axis forces had occupied positions three or four miles south of Thela. Last night's Rommel news confirmed the temporary lull in the fighting in southern Tunisia. The British Eighth Army's actions on Monday were limited to patrol activities and artillery bombardment.</p>

<h3>Before Going to Europe, the Archbishop of New York Meets with Roosevelt; It Is Reported that Mr. Smith Is Responsible for Persuading the Vatican to Take a More Moderate Attitude Towards the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Alliance News Agency Telegram) According to a Washington dispatch, President Roosevelt admitted that he had met with Archbishop Spellman of New York before his departure for Europe. Mr. Spellman went abroad as a chaplain with the U.S. Army. It is inconvenient to say whether he carried his letter or not. According to reports, Mr. Spellman arrived in the Vatican on Saturday after staying in Spain for several days.</p>
<p>Budapest, 24th (Haitong News Agency Telegram) – The news of Archbishop Spellman of New York's report to Rome has attracted the attention of Hungarians. Although officials have not issued an opinion, newspaper editorials have pointed out that Mr. Spellman's report to Rome implies that the democratic self-determination rights advocated by Britain and the United States conflict with the Soviet Union's demand to permanently occupy the coastal countries of the Baltic Sea and Bessarabia. Although the British and American governments are prepared to recognize the Soviet Union's power in Southeastern Europe, they are still willing to maintain the independence and integrity of the small countries in the region. When we learn that Mr. Smith is responsible for persuading the Vatican to take a more moderate attitude towards the Soviet government, we must still remember that the different attitudes of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union towards the Baltic region still exist.</p>

<h3>Donets German Counter-Offensive Recaptures Several Villages; Germans Attack Soviet Positions at the Mouth of the Kuban River; Fierce Fighting Continues in Kharkov-Kursk</h3>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Simeng News Agency Telegram) – The Burmese official declared last night that after Stalin encouraged his soldiers on the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Red Army, the Soviet army immediately resumed pressure in several areas, but on Monday the German army fought a defensive battle in the eastern Vietnam area, making a strong counter-offensive, driving the Soviet army out of several villages and inflicting heavy losses on them. The fighting in the Kharkov-Kursk area was particularly fierce. The Soviet army's attempt to break into the German positions in the area failed. German infantry drove the Soviet army out of two residential areas a day. As a result of the German counter-offensive between the Donets River and the Dnieper River, several villages were also recaptured. The German Air Force assisted in the battle, destroying 22 tanks and many heavy artillery pieces. On Monday, the Soviet Union lost more than 200 tanks, and yesterday the Soviet aircraft lost no less than 99 aircraft across the entire line. Four Soviet infantry brigades were annihilated north of the Donets Basin and the mouth of the Don River. On Monday, several Soviet infantry divisions, assisted by tank and bomber groups, attacked the German defense line in the Donets Basin, but the German defenders held their ground and inflicted heavy losses on the Soviet army, destroying 28 of their tanks. Another part of the German army on the front line attacked, seemingly surrounding some Soviet troops. Many Soviet troops surrendered. The remaining surrounded Soviet troops were wiped out. North of the mouth of the Kuban River in northwestern Caucasus, the German army attacked the Soviet line, destroying 14 artillery pieces, 23 mortars, and 19 machine guns. Fierce fighting continued in Orel, but details were unknown.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Alliance News Agency Telegram) – According to figures released by the German side today, the Soviet army has lost 18 million people in the 20 months since the start of the German-Soviet war. This is the total of the figures that have been announced in the past, including 12.4 million killed and wounded and 5.4 million captured. During the same period, the Red Army lost 48,000 artillery pieces and 34,000 tanks.</p>
<p>The Winter Offensive Has Reached Its Peak; It is Difficult to Decide the Battle Before Spring</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Haitong News Agency Telegram) – The German army has launched several planned actions between the Donets River and the Dnieper River to break the Soviet army's encirclement plan. The Soviet army, which advanced towards Mariupol, Zaporozhye, and Dnipropetrovsk, encountered a German counter-offensive. Its development can be divided into three phases. In the first phase, the German army attacked the left wing of the Soviet army with a large number of tanks to prevent it from continuing to advance south. In the second phase, the German army advancing from the Dnieper River bend engaged in fierce fighting with the vanguard of the Soviet army and drove the Soviet army back from the northeast. In the third phase, the German army launched a fierce counter-offensive in the northwest of Krasnodar, breaking through the right wing of the Soviet army, encircling and annihilating a large Soviet army, and the remaining troops collapsed. The Soviet army's second offensive thus completely failed. However, the Soviet army is not willing to give up on this. The Red Army headquarters is now concentrating a large army in the Izium area, waiting for an opportunity to attack. According to news from the eastern front, the enemy army's attack on the Mius front line protecting Taganrog was very fierce. Another part of the Soviet army attacked the eastern border of the Central Donets Basin in an attempt to rescue the Soviet army that was being attacked in the area, but it failed. The situation between Kharkov and Kursk remains unchanged. The war in the Orel area is becoming increasingly fierce, but the Soviet army has not achieved any victory. Looking at the overall situation on the eastern front, the peak of the Soviet army's winter offensive has passed, and the enemy army has not achieved any major breakthrough. Although the Soviet army still wants to continue to launch a large-scale offensive, it is a pipe dream to hope that the war will be decided before spring arrives.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency Telegram) – The German Command explained the war situation on the eastern front on the 23rd, saying that the Soviet army had launched an offensive in the southern part of the eastern line for several days, but it had all failed. The Soviet army's counter-offensive in the eastern Donets Basin had also been frustrated, and its attempt to attack the German army from behind had also been crushed by the German army. The Soviet army west of Kharkov had fallen into the German encirclement, and its retreat had been completely cut off. Coupled with the continuous bombing by the German Air Force, it had fallen into a state of chaos. In addition, the German army in the central Donets River and Dnieper River, under the cover of the air force, concentrated its attacks on the enemy's positions, annihilating several Soviet teams. In addition, fierce fighting is still going on in the far west of Kharkov and in the south of Kursk and Orel. The fighting is most intense in the Orel area. Although the Soviet army mobilized air, land, and mechanized units in an attempt to counter-attack, it all failed. In the battle on the 22nd, the Soviet army had 55 tanks destroyed. In addition, the war situation south of Lake Ladoga is also becoming increasingly fierce. During a large-scale offensive by the Soviet army in one area, it also lost 47 tanks before retreating.</p>
<h3>Direct Harbor Ships Come and Go Frequently</h3>

<h3>British Bevin Announces Mobilization of Women</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 24th (Haitong News Agency Telegram) – London telegram, Labor Minister Bevin declared in the House of Commons yesterday that a large number of men have enlisted in the army, so it is necessary to continue to mobilize laborers and female workers to work in munitions factories. The employment of male workers will inevitably result in the phenomenon of moving from area A to area B, but when employing female workers, the authorities should try to make them work locally. The authorities intend to take over the large hotels in the industrial center as places for workers to live. The system of collective cooking for female workers' families, which has been implemented in centralized countries, may also be considered. Mr. Bell continued to reveal that workers' holidays and passenger transportation will continue to be restricted.</p>
<h3>Local Successes on the Eastern Front Do Not Make the Battle Situation Optimistic; Soviet Ambassador to Britain Delivers a Speech; Urges the Implementation of the Actions Decided at the Canada-Hong Kong Conference</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a dispatch from London, Soviet Chairman Stalin issued a bulletin to the Soviet soldiers on the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Red Army on the 23rd, warning them to be vigilant against the German spring offensive and not to be deceived by excessive optimism. Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky also delivered a speech at the opening ceremony of the Soviet Union and the 25th Anniversary of the Soviet Army Exhibition in London on the 23rd, demanding the immediate opening of the Second Front in Europe, generally saying that we cannot be optimistic about the future of the battle situation due to the local successes of the Soviet army on the Eastern Front. It must be known that there are still many difficulties in the future of the anti-Axis forces. The Soviet Union expects the United Kingdom and the United States to promptly implement the actions decided at the Canada-Hong Kong Conference. Only if the anti-Axis forces start attacking the German army on the European continent can the German army be trapped in a predicament of being attacked from the east and west. The victory of the anti-Axis forces can be achieved sooner, which can reduce the sacrifice of the Soviet Union's loss of most of its lives as the price of obtaining military success, but at the same time the country has been turned into scorched earth and has suffered heavy sacrifices.</p>
<h3>Gandhi's Condition Shows Slight Improvement</h3>

<h3>Chairman Wang Meets with German Reporter to Discuss China's Participation in the War</h3>
<p>Chairman Wang met with Mr. Langmei, the East Asia General Manager of the Huitong News Agency, today and discussed the issue of China's participation in the war. He stated that the Chinese people are suffering various hardships, and it is necessary for the people to understand that such hardships are a necessary phenomenon for the liberation of Greater East Asia and China. The economic and spiritual influence of Britain and the United States will be eliminated with the declaration of war. China's military strength will also gradually increase with the declaration of war, and it will actively participate in the defense of China and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. After China declares war, it will strengthen its economic power. A recent economic conference was held, attended by government officials, industry leaders, and representatives from the North China Political Affairs Commission, as well as industry leaders from North China. North China will intensify its cooperation with the central government. North China has already raised the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun, and the national government will make every effort to increase military efforts to strive for final victory. Chairman Wang is very concerned about the European issue. He firmly believes that on the Eastern Front, the German army will be able to complete its mission.</p>
<h3>Current Military and Political Situation in the South</h3>
<p>The military and political implementation in the Japanese-occupied areas of the South is progressing very smoothly. This article describes the basic structure and current situation of the military administration in the South as disclosed by the Japanese naval authorities.</p>
<p>Policy</p>
<p>The military administration in the occupied areas must adapt to the actual conditions of each region, so the methods and forms vary. The fundamental policy of implementing military administration, of course, is to unify the administration and resource development. Therefore, the army and navy have close ties in the central government and are also making great efforts to coordinate with the Greater East Asia Ministry to ensure smooth implementation. Important matters concerning the handling and administration of the occupied areas are decided at liaison conferences between the General Headquarters and the government. Major matters related to economic development are decided by a liaison committee composed of the army, navy, and related ministries in the central government. The implementation is also based on this, handling matters that each city should undertake. There are also many matters that are negotiated and adjusted between the military and political organs of the army and navy locally. For example, in the Southern region, due to the uneven distribution of materials, the problem of material exchange between regions has arisen, as well as the handling of special product resources, as well as transportation, communication, postal issues, etc. These issues, which are interrelated and involve the entire administration and development, are implemented smoothly after each organization adjusts from a broad perspective. The army and navy, whether in the central government or in various places, are united in combat and also cooperate closely in military administration. Therefore, the fundamental policy of implementing military administration in the occupied areas is to complete the Greater East Asia War, quickly restore order, and intensify the development of national defense resources as the primary requirements. At the same time, it is also urgent for the combat troops to ensure self-sufficiency on the spot. All administration and development policies are implemented in order according to this fundamental policy, and the main ones are outlined below.</p>
<p>(1) In terms of governance, in order to grasp the fundamentals of governance, military administrative organs should make the most of the remaining governing institutions. Those with sincerity and reputation among local chiefs, aborigines, and elders should be actively utilized to ensure smooth and appropriate operation. At the same time, the original social organizations, religions, and ethnic customs should be respected, and interference should be avoided as much as possible. In particular, careful attention should be paid to matters such as preferential treatment for the Japanese in order to stabilize and grasp the hearts of the people.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the acquisition and development of major national defense resources, the primary is to see practical results, utilizing the capabilities and experience of state-run and private enterprises to the greatest extent. Therefore, most of the projects, due to differences in industry type and scale, are managed by designated suitable entities entrusted by the central government, while special projects are directly managed by the military or state-owned enterprises. The business of entrusted management should be mainly focused on adapting to the requirements of the war.</p>
<p>Therefore, the entrusted management business does not grant any rights or interests to the designated operators, nor does it impose any constraints on the so-called established facts of the future. It is only for the immediate needs of carrying out the war, and it bears a major national responsibility in the development and construction of the occupied areas. Standing on the front line of the South, it is expected to be actively involved and obtain quick and continuous results. Furthermore, the economic lives of the indigenous people should be endured with some unavoidable difficulties for the sake of completing the Greater East Asia War. Within the scope of not hindering the self-sufficiency of the combat troops and the acquisition of national defense resources, efforts should be made to alleviate the impact of the war, maintain a minimum standard of living, and guide the indigenous people to thoroughly understand the true meaning of the Greater East Asia War and trust the Japanese army.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding transportation, the greatest efforts should be made to enhance the transportation of materials. Completing port facilities is of utmost importance. Shipbuilding, especially wooden ships, should also be promoted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding cultural and educational policies, in addition to the existing religions, other inherent beliefs, and even the customs of the societies to cultivate the people, the schools of the gentry and commoners should be restored and enriched as soon as possible, and technical education should be popularized in order to promote prosperity. At the same time, the popularization of Japanese language and Japanese culture should be promoted to encourage comprehensive cooperation with Japan.</p>
<p>Guidance for Japanese advances is also of great importance in governance. Japanese people should have the cultivation of self-awareness as a guiding nation, and as members of the Yamato race, they should lead and guide the indigenous people well. Therefore, those who cross the sea should be strictly selected, and those who are already in the local area should also be properly guided at all times.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the handling of enemy property, it should also be properly utilized with the goal of completing the war in order to enhance current combat power. Private privileges will of course no longer be granted.</p>
<p>(6) Regarding currency, local currency and military scrip are used together, but it is planned to use local currency to replace military scrip as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Organization</p>
<p>In the naval aspect, the commander-in-chief of the fleet in that area is the highest responsible person for military administration. Under him is the Director-General of the Civil Government, who is responsible for civil affairs.</p>
<p>In the civil government, in addition to the Director-General's office, there are also six bureaus: General Affairs, Finance, Industry, Transportation and Civil Engineering, Health, and Legal Affairs. As a local organization, the civil government has a Civil Affairs Department under the Director-General, responsible for civil affairs in each of its jurisdictions. Civil Affairs Department branches have been established in necessary locations under each Civil Affairs Department, and local administrative organizations below the State Governor are currently being established in various places.</p>
<p>A separate civil government has been established in New Guinea. The Director-General and other staff members have already advanced to the area at the beginning of this year. The organization of this civil government is different from other civil governments. Taking the rapid development of New Guinea as the primary task, it has established a Director-General's Office, a Development Bureau, a Health Bureau, and a Survey Bureau, and personnel selection has also been carefully considered. New Guinea is an undeveloped virgin land, and resource development is very promising. The civil government has specially attached a powerful survey and exploration team to plan to intensify field surveys.</p>
<p>Current situation</p>
<p>(1) General situation of public order: Many of the naval military administrative jurisdiction areas are undeveloped virgin lands, so their governance is relatively primitive. In general, the original methods are still followed. Each state and local chief (state governor or sultan) is generally appointed from among the natives in his original position, and he is ordered to resume administrative affairs within his respective territory. Laws and regulations are only modified and applied to the necessary parts, and taxation continues in the same way.</p>
<p>(2) General public sentiment: Public order is very good, and there is no unrest in governance. Regarding the lives of the natives, it is still necessary to make efforts to allocate and exchange rice and increase production in various places. At the same time, clothing, sundries, etc. should also be exchanged between the occupied areas. Furthermore, the collection of the bark fiber of local cinnamon wood (transliteration) and other methods to make substitutes are planned and will be implemented soon.</p>
<p>In addition, how to handle the coconut kernels on which the majority of residents in various places depend for their livelihoods is also a major issue in governance. It is planned to establish a coconut kernel management association to engage in the collection of coconut kernels, transport them to the country, and extract oil locally. Some of it has already begun. Coconut kernels are also used as substitute fuel, and they are currently being used in internal combustion engines, and it is planned to greatly expand this in the future. From the perspective of maintaining the minimum living standards of 700,000 natives, the rubber cultivation business in Borneo is also an important issue. It is currently launching a raw rubber and rubber liquid manufacturing business near Balikpapan in order to digest rubber.</p>
<p>(3) Economic Development (1) Oil-related facilities were not greatly damaged by the enemy, and they have been rapidly restored thanks to the great efforts after the Japanese army occupied them. At the end of last year, oil in Borneo had begun to be restored, and some of it had continued to produce oil. The survey of Tangjong (Palembang) was completed at the end of December last year, and it is currently being prepared for development and will soon produce oil. The oil refinery, port, and equipment in Palembang are excellent and unparalleled. Immediately after the occupation, work was started to restore it, and as a result of the efforts, it is now able to fully exert its oil refining capacity. (2) Coal in Borneo plays an important role in future development in the South. Currently, the Parlaff and Loa Kulu locations have already been restored and are continuing production. (3) The nickel mining in Celebes is proceeding very smoothly, and a considerable amount has been imported into Japan so far. (4) Cotton production in Celebes and the Lesser Sunda Islands is promising. This year, 2,500 chobu of cotton with good cotton quality will be cultivated near Manado, and it is expected to implement formal planting in the coming year. (5) In order to ensure the accuracy of future development plans, emergency surveys of minerals, electricity, agriculture, forestry, and fisheries are currently being conducted in the regions of Celebes, Borneo, Ceram, and the Lesser Sunda Islands. (6) Regarding communications in the occupied areas, naval military communications are currently the main focus, and they were temporarily restored by the end of last year. Dispatch of postal workers, the International Electrical Communication Company, and other key personnel. Makassar began broadcasting on December 8 last year. Telecommunications and telephone services can also be implemented from February 1st. (7) Maritime transportation is divided into trunk lines and coastal routes, and those who can afford it have been decided. A regular route connecting Japan on the trunk line is currently being planned, while some of the coastal routes have already been implemented to increase transport capacity. It is urgent both domestically and abroad, and efforts are being made to utilize requisitioned ships, salvage sunken ships, and use wooden ships. There are currently about eleven locations in the local area that are keenly engaged in the construction of wooden ships. In fiscal year 1943, it is planned to build wooden ships of 150 to 500 tons, equivalent to motor-sailers. (8) In order to improve other intermediate economic structures, the entry of small and medium-sized merchants and industrialists from the home country is considered necessary. A delegation of small and medium-sized merchants and industrialists is scheduled to be sent recently, and the names and addresses of the companies are being investigated.</p>
<p>(4) Finance: A general outline of the institutions has been prepared. The financial institutions on the Japanese side that are operating locally include: Bank of Japan's national treasury agency and Southern Development Gold Depository or branch in Makassar in Celebes, Manado, Balikpapan in Borneo, Palembang, Ternate, Samarinda, Pontianak, Ambon in Ceram, Rabaul in New Britain, Singaraja in the Lesser Sunda Islands, etc., and the Bank of Taiwan acts as its agent. Among the existing financial institutions and private banks, there are thirteen operating in addition to Makassar.</p>
<p>(5) Cultural Relations: In the cultural aspect, most of the indigenous schools have already resumed classes. In other cities with Civil Affairs Department branches such as Makassar, Balikpapan, and Ambon, Japanese language schools have been opened to popularize Japanese.</p>
<p>(6) In addition, civil affairs departments have been established in New Britain and the Andaman Islands to carry out civil administration under the command of naval commanders. Among them, the Rabaul Civil Affairs Department in New Britain is on the front line of operations, and the cooperation between civil and military officials has successfully completed the mission of military and political governance.</p>
<p>(7) The above-mentioned military and political measures in the occupied areas are all aimed at winning the Greater East Asia War, satisfying the requirements of the combat troops, and giving priority to the rapid development of materials necessary for national defense. Great expectations are placed on it in carrying out the war, and today its actual achievements are already quite considerable. (翔: Translated from the February 18 Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun)</p>

<h3>Return of the French Concession Imminent, Shanghai's Administrative Rights Trend Toward Unification, Specialized Talents Should Continue to be Hired, Police Administration Will Strengthen Capabilities</h3>
<p>Mayor Chen Issues Statement</p>
<p>Regarding the return of the French Concession, Mayor Chen issued the following statement yesterday: "The French government announced on the 23rd that, in order to strengthen the friendly relations between China and France, it has decided to abolish extraterritorial rights in China and give up the various concessions. I believe that the citizens of Shanghai share my personal feelings of boundless excitement and deep gratitude.</p>
<p>Although Shanghai has been one of the largest cities in China and the world in the past, it has not been able to be unified administratively due to the concessions. Therefore, despite its past prosperity, public security has always been a problem, which is a regret to both Chinese and foreigners.</p>
<p>Now, in order to strengthen the friendly relations between China and France, the French government has resolutely and voluntarily abolished extraterritorial rights in China and abandoned the concessions. It is expected that the Shanghai municipal administration will soon be unified, and the capabilities of the police will also be strengthened. In the future, Shanghai will not only become more prosperous, but also eliminate the shortcomings of the past.</p>
<p>As for the personnel in the French Concession, I will pay the utmost attention to them. Because those who serve in the Conseil Municipal and the Shanghai Municipal Council are either specialized technical talents or have many years of municipal experience, the Chinese government will naturally continue to hire them in the future to facilitate the progress of the Shanghai municipal administration. This is what I firmly believe and what the citizens of Shanghai expect.</p>
<p>The friendly relations between China and France have always been cordial. Now that the French government has taken this action, it can further promote the deep friendship between the people of the two countries. As the Mayor of Shanghai, I am truly fortunate to witness the return of the French Concession."</p>
<p>Friendly Relations Will Become Closer</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) In order to promote the friendly relations between China and France, following the signing of agreements between friendly Japan and our country on the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights, the French government resolutely announced yesterday the abolition of administrative rights in China and the return of concessions in various parts of China. After all preparations are completed, it will be implemented. The government of our country and friendly Japan have expressed their goodwill towards the wise measures of the French government. The economic circles of Shanghai also believe that the return of the concessions by the French authorities is of profound significance. In the past, the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors of Shanghai have been difficult to fully develop due to the various privileges of the concessions, and there have also been many inconveniences for the government to implement finance. After the government of our country declared war on Britain and the United States, the French government returned the concessions in China, which is of great significance to promoting the completion of a unified economic structure in our country. For example, in the past, all tax policies promoted by our country could not be extended to the concession areas, resulting in various situations that affected national tax revenue, and the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors were also subject to many barriers. After the government recovers the concessions, all wartime administrative powers will be unified, and the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors of the city will be adjusted and reorganized under the supervision and leadership of the government, and the economic structure can be smoothly promoted. At that time, the national government's tax revenue can also be increased in efficiency. Therefore, all sectors of the city have embraced good feelings upon hearing the news.</p>
<p>Technical Problems Are Not Difficult</p>
<p>(Domei News Agency, Shanghai) Mr. Tsuzaki, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, said when he hosted the press on Tuesday night that the Vichy government's decision to abandon judicial privileges and administrative power in the French Concession in China is a major step towards the birth of a new China, which is completely different from the empty promises of the United States and Britain to abolish their privileges in China. The United States and Britain are only making propaganda to abandon their privileges in China, but in fact they have lost nothing. France's move has obvious results and expresses its sincere friendship with China. Therefore, the steps taken by France will not only strengthen the friendly relations between China and France and Japan, but also enhance the political power of the national government. The technical problems involved in the return of the French Concession will be resolved smoothly and without difficulty.</p>
<h3>Director of Information Hirota Issues Statement</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy held a routine reception for Chinese newspaper reporters at 3:00 p.m. yesterday (2nd) at the 8th floor of the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road. During the meeting, Director of Information Hirota first expressed his views on the French government's announcement of the voluntary abolition of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of the concessions, believing that the French government's resolute announcement of the abolition of extraterritorial rights and the return of the concessions is in fact tantamount to recognizing the National Government. In the future, the friendly relations between China and France will become closer. In terms of Greater East Asia, France is actively cooperating with Japan and adopting this new policy, which is of great significance. Japan expresses its utmost respect for this. He then explained the progress of the Greater East Asia War, from the recent close development of Japanese-French relations, the Japanese army's advance into Guangzhou Bay, and the occupation of the Leizhou Peninsula, which completely cut off the last transportation stronghold of Chongqing. The so-called Northwest Highway of Chongqing is geographically of no value in terms of transportation. This invisibly makes the United States' key policy of attempting to use Chongqing to attack Japan completely ineffective. In terms of the Greater East Asia war situation, the United States no longer has the possibility of large-scale attacks on Japan. Even the small-scale guerrilla warfare has so little loss to Japan that it is not worth mentioning. Recently, Japanese naval aircraft have been active in the skies over Australia, and the military progress has completely cut off the transportation line between Australia and the United States. From this, it can be seen that Japan's military position in the Greater East Asia War is becoming more consolidated, and it has a firm and unyielding belief, ready to defend against any place and ready to annihilate the enemy's so-called large-scale offensive without any fear. Finally, regarding the situation in the European war, Germany has retreated slightly on the Soviet front due to strategic relations. The land abandoned accounts for only one-twentieth of the total, and this retreat is safe, preserving military strength, so that it can attack at any time. This is retreating in order to advance. Therefore, it can be seen that the various rumors about the German army are unfounded. In the North African battle, the Axis forces are also winning one victory after another. In short, the facts prove that any unfounded propaganda by the United States and Britain against the Axis will be self-defeating.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Qingxiang Branch Held Liaison Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Qingxiang Branch and the Qingxiang Department of the special service organ of a friendly country hold a liaison meeting once a week to exchange opinions on the implementation of Qingxiang in Shanghai and to establish a promotion policy. Yesterday (24th) was the meeting date, and the liaison meeting was held at 9:00 a.m. in the conference room of the branch. More than 20 people attended, including Mr. Xu, Director of the Office of the Branch, heads of propaganda groups from various departments, Lieutenant Colonel Igarashi, Deputy Director of the Qingxiang Department of the friendly country, and heads of various squads. First, each unit reported separately, and then the discussion began. After a detailed discussion on the second phase of the Qingxiang promotion policy and the demarcation of boundaries, a decision was made. The meeting adjourned after two hours.</p>
<p>Chongming District Investigation Work</p>
<p>Chongming News: The Investigation Department of the Shanghai Qingxiang Branch, in order to understand the general situation of the district in anticipation of the imminent start of the Qingxiang work in this district, sent a special commissioner to Chongming to organize an investigation department, which has officially started operations. It is reported that the investigation scope of the department is divided into administration, autonomy, public security, finance, taxation, food for the people, materials, education, culture, and transportation. Currently, all tasks are being actively promoted, and it is planned to hold symposiums with district government security and armor, local gentry, and food for the people, as well as set up public opinion boxes to solicit opinions from all parties in order to truly understand the general situation of the district.</p>
<p>Police Bureau Handles Residence Permits</p>
<p>Another message: The district government, after the implementation of the reorganization of security and armor in this district, the citizen certificates have been suspended, and the police bureau is handling residence permits instead. This residence permit is for proving the identity of a good citizen and is of great importance. Moreover, Qingxiang will be implemented in this district soon. Those without the above-mentioned certificates will be treated as undesirable elements. Director Jin is deeply concerned that the people do not understand the stakes involved, so he issued a report hoping that the people will apply for residence permits without delay.</p>
<h3>Retail Donation Limit for January to be Paid this Afternoon, Penalties for Late Payment</h3>
<p>Regarding the two-cent retail donation for January of this year, which the Shanghai Public Concession Engineering Bureau entrusted to various industry companies and merchants in the concession to collect on its behalf, all payments must be made to the designated ten offices before this afternoon. Late payments or underreporting will be subject to appropriate penalties.</p>
<h3>Various Industries Strengthen Evaluation Organizations, Carefully Review Price Limits, Industry Demands for Adjustment Still Under Consideration, Some Goods Already Given Legal Profits</h3>
<p>In order to assist the authorities in suppressing prices on a large scale, the Evaluation Committee of the various industry trade associations has successively strengthened the organizational structure of the Evaluation Committee since the beginning of this month and has hired industry professionals to participate. They have been carefully studying specific methods. A reporter from Datong News Agency continued to learn yesterday that the organizational structure of the Evaluation Committee of the various industries has been adjusted separately under the leadership of the relevant authorities. However, in order to actively promote and seek the welfare of the industry, meetings have been held in recent days to carefully review whether the price limits of the items evaluated in the past meet the standards. It is reported that some trade associations, due to repeated demands from the industry, are unable to obtain legal profits at the current price limits of the evaluated items and plan to make appropriate adjustments in order to maintain them. Therefore, the various trade associations are seriously considering the price limits and may ask the authorities to review them again.</p>
<h3>Women's Welfare Association Moves to New Location to Work</h3>
<p>In order to actively promote its affairs, the Shanghai Women's Welfare Association has found a new location due to the inadequacy of the original location. It has decided to move to the new location, located at No. 15, Xuhui Road, on the 26th (tomorrow). It is reported that the association will start working at the new location next month and will develop its affairs according to the original plan.</p>
<h3>City Education Association Holds Third Meeting</h3>
<p>The City Education Association held its third committee meeting on the afternoon of the 23rd to discuss future work plans. Those present included President Chen Gongbo, Vice President Yuan Ludeng, Secretary-General Zhou Huarren, Committee Member Hu Dunfu, and twenty-eight others. President Chen chaired the meeting and reported on (1) the handling of school building disputes and (2) the progress of negotiations with the Public Works Department (工部局) regarding subsidies for various schools. The meeting then began discussing proposals: (1) Proposed by Secretary-General Zhou, regarding the financial difficulties of private primary and secondary schools in the Special District and requesting assistance; (2) Proposed by Secretary-General Zhou, regarding requesting the Municipal Government Health Bureau to establish a free clinic for teachers and staff in the Special District for relief; (3) Proposed by Committee Member Liang, regarding requesting the French Concession authorities to abolish school business licenses and the procedure for stamping recruitment posters. All the above proposals were successfully passed. After the meeting, the association resolved to do its utmost to improve the welfare of teachers and students in various Special District schools in order to solve some of their living difficulties.</p>
<p>Huazhong Tobacco Combination Unifies Cigarette Allocation, Effective March 1st, Strictly Prohibiting Black Market Price Gouging</p>
<p>In order to unify the allocation of cigarettes, the Huazhong Tobacco Allocation Combination has completed the registration and review of all cigarette dealers in the city. The allocation will be implemented from March 1st. The cigarettes produced by (1) Jun Guanli Yizhong Tobacco Company (軍管理頣中烟公司), (2) Japanese-owned Zhonghua Tobacco Company (日商中華烟草公司), and (3) Chinese-owned Nanyang Huacheng, Xin Dadong, and other factories will be allocated by the combination. Major trading companies have been designated to handle the distribution. The allocation will be made according to the actual needs of each dealer. It is reported that the combination will absolutely crack down on the black market trading of cigarettes after the unified allocation. All dealers must sell at the prescribed price, and must not raise prices or hoard goods, except for the permitted 2% retail donation. Violators will have their distribution permanently revoked and will be severely punished. The dealers have been given reasonable and legitimate profits. Before the unified allocation, companies such as Yongtaihe Company, Huayuan Tobacco Store, and various Chinese tobacco factories had already started distributing cigarettes themselves in order to suppress cigarette prices. The total capital of the combination is 60 million yuan, which is contributed by the military-managed Yizhong Company, Zhonghua Tobacco Company, Japanese cigarette sales agents, Yongtaihe Company, Jiuda Company, Chinese cigarette sales agents, and Nanyang, Fuxin, Dadong, Huacheng, and four other Chinese tobacco factories, totaling fifteen companies.</p>

<h3>Suggestions for Anti-Spitting Penalties</h3>
<p>One</p>
<p>According to a Public Works Department (工部局) announcement in the newspaper: In accordance with Article 51 of the Land Regulations, the Bureau may impose a fine of five yuan on anyone who spits indiscriminately. This penalty will not only be implemented during the current Second Anti-Spitting Campaign, but will also be strictly enforced at any time thereafter, in order to eliminate the bad habit of spitting at will.</p>
<p>Indeed, spitting is an absolutely immoral act. I would like to offer some additional suggestions based on my humble observations:</p>
<p>(1) The sanitation authorities of the Concession may wish to hold another anti-spitting propaganda week. During this week, all personnel should be mobilized, along with Baojia (保甲) self-defense members, to conduct practical propaganda. Anyone found spitting indiscriminately should be advised on the one hand, and ordered to wipe it away on the other. The aim is to make spitters feel the trouble of wiping away the phlegm, and gradually automatically prohibit spitting. It should also be extended to all major and minor streets throughout the city, and simply paying attention to the main thoroughfares is of no avail.</p>
<p>(2) Afterwards, a second propaganda week should be held. During this second anti-spitting campaign week, anyone found still spitting indiscriminately should be reprimanded by the person in charge, and his citizen's card confiscated. A fine of five yuan should be imposed for the offense of not carrying a citizen's card, and he should be required to go to the Public Works Department (工部局) to retrieve it. (At that time, the Public Works Department (工部局) may also wish to set up a department specifically for this purpose.) This measure can not only prohibit indiscriminate spitting, but also check citizens' cards, killing two birds with one stone. Why not do it?</p>
<p>(Xin Yuan)</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Chinese people have never paid attention to hygiene, so spitting anywhere has become a habit. If we want to correct this bad habit, we must enforce it. If there is any violation, a fine of five yuan is not excessive. However, when a violator is caught by a patrolman or a police officer, he must go to the police station according to the regulations. If the violator happens to have an urgent matter, such as seeking medical attention or taking a boat or car, the loss cannot be estimated. I believe that the Public Works Department (工部局) should print the fine receipt (preferably in duplicate, with the name, address, and citizen's card number of the violator filled in) and distribute it to the Baojia (保甲) heads for management. If there is a violation, the patrolman or self-defense member should detain the violator and take him to the Jia (甲) head, who will impose the fine and issue a receipt. Each week, the Jia (甲) heads should make a list and submit it to the Bao (保) head for collection and delivery to the Public Works Department (工部局). In this way, time can be saved. Although the Baojia (保甲) heads will have to put in more effort, for the sake of the public, I don't think they would be unwilling, right? (Xu Wenbai)</p>

<p>Education and Broadcasting</p>
<p>Lin Jiongan, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, gave a radio address entitled "Broadcasting and Education" for the 2nd anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Broadcasting Industry Construction Association, stating:</p>
<p>Listeners, the day before yesterday was the 2nd anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Broadcasting Industry Construction Association. I am grateful to the Shanghai Broadcasting Station for inviting me to speak. As I am responsible for education administration in this city, I would like to say a few words on the topic of "Broadcasting and Education."</p>
<p>The function of radio broadcasting is to promote doctrines and national policies, broadcast news and music, and conduct international propaganda, among other great tasks. It can also broadcast various educational programs to increase listeners' knowledge and subtly instill education in the public. Because radio has such great effects, all countries in the world are actively promoting it and making every effort to advocate for educational broadcasting.</p>
<p>Japan's broadcasting industry was established in 1925, unified national broadcasting in 1926, and started international broadcasting in 1927. Now, whether for domestic or international propaganda, it has achieved good success. I would now like to tell you about the story of Japanese educational broadcasting, that is, its characteristics, and choose one or two points to introduce to you.</p>
<p>First, the most effective thing in Japanese educational broadcasting in the past was radio calisthenics. Every morning from 7:00 to 8:30, the broadcasting station broadcasts calisthenics commands and music. The commands are loud and solemn three times. When broadcasting, people, regardless of men, women, old or young, except for a few who practice at home, gather in elementary schools, listen to commands and music, practice gymnastics, and absorb fresh air. Therefore, the physiques of Japanese men and women are very strong, and they have an attitude of being close to and happy to do gymnastics. Moreover, because elementary schools across the country use radio calisthenics every day, more than 10 million students across the country can consolidate their national consciousness and promote the national spirit. The educational effect of such group training is worth emulating in our country.</p>
<p>The second point is that the programs of Japanese educational broadcasting are extremely wonderful in terms of quality. Because the programs can affect the daily life and thoughts of social listeners, Japanese politicians and social leaders have organized a broadcasting program advisory group to engage in the research and implementation of various programs.</p>
<p>In the past, private radio stations in various parts of our country, in order to cater to the low-level tastes of the general audience, often broadcast some inappropriate songs. This is not only unhelpful to the people, but harmful to them. Japan's broadcasting programs can cater to the interests of the public, coupled with the widespread installation of radio receivers, so the number of listeners nationwide accounts for about 60% of the total population. They often gather a group of men, women, old and young, next to the radio in shops and listen attentively. When domestic and foreign political news is broadcast, they are even more silent. This is enough to see the degree to which the people of friendly countries are concerned about current affairs and the development of public intelligence.</p>
<p>In addition to the characteristics mentioned above, Japanese educational broadcasting also has the characteristics of designated teacher time, which is specifically aimed at teachers to promote teacher further study, and broadcasting music to schools to cultivate national sentiments. Looking back at our country's broadcasting industry, although broadcasting began in 1922 with the establishment of the American-owned China Radio Corporation, the Central Broadcasting Radio Station was not completed until 1932. As for the educational broadcasting industry, the Ministry of Education did not start broadcasting until 1935 to promote social education and auxiliary school education.</p>
<p>After the incident, our country's original central broadcasting business was completely suspended, and the Shanghai broadcasting business was mostly controlled by the Yu (渝) side's forces. What they broadcast, of course, violated the national policy of the national government. On February 22, 1941, Japan completely returned the radio stations established in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, and Hangzhou to our country for operation. In order to actively develop the broadcasting industry, the government specially established the Chinese Broadcasting Industry Construction Association on that day. We have enjoyed many beneficial and important broadcasting facilities managed by the association in the past two years, so this day is worth commemorating. At the same time, we feel that the relationship between broadcasting and education is very close. Friendly country Japan's educational broadcasting has received great results. Now that our government and people have entered the era of total war participation in politics, economy, and culture, then in the future we should cooperate to promote education and broadcasting to complete the new mission of the new era. This is naturally the responsibility of each of us. Listeners, let's get up and take on our respective responsibilities.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Custodial Housing Holds Transfer Ceremony Chinese and Japanese Officials Attend in Person</h3>
<p>Due to the impact of the war, most of the owners of houses in District 1 of Zhabei in this city have left their homes and have no one to manage them. Later, Japanese residents lived in them, and the Japanese Resident Group took custody of them and collected rent. Now, in order to respect our country's rights and interests, the Japanese side has specially transferred the jurisdiction of the houses and the rent collected, amounting to 479,873.37 Japanese military yen, to the Municipal Government for custody. The transfer ceremony was held yesterday (the 24th) at 10:00 a.m. in the Naval Attaché's Office. Mayor Chen and Secretary-General Zhao attended in person. On the Japanese side, Military Attaché Oka, Special Service Agency Director Watanabe, Supervisory Section Chief Yoshimi, and Consul Zhongtian represented both parties to handle the handover procedures.</p>
<p>Japan transferred the management of Zhabei houses to China, and both parties held a ceremony in the conference room of the Japanese Naval Attaché's Office in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>This Year Silver and Money Industry Will Do Its Best to Promote Acceptance of Bills of Exchange Cooperate Sincerely with Industry and Commerce to Promote The Enactment of Resolutions and Various Documents</h3>
<p>In order to improve the method of credit lending, facilitate freight transport in various places, restore the inherent ethics of commerce, and assist the development of bill circulation, the silver and money industry has decided to promote commercial acceptance bills of exchange and bank acceptance bills of exchange with all its strength starting this year. After careful study by the Banking Association, soliciting opinions from experts in various banks, a resolution was passed to implement various measures and draft various forms of bills of exchange, as well as various regulations and contracts. Recently, various banks have handled the acceptance and discount business, and the Central Reserve Bank has agreed to rediscount.</p>
<p>Resolution</p>
<p>(1) First, handle the business of commercial acceptance and discount. However, industry and commerce and the silver and money industry must cooperate and do their best to promote it. The silver and money industry should also implement it consistently and provide convenience for discounting to facilitate advancement and capital turnover. Draft commercial acceptance bill of exchange forms, payment notices, discount application forms, and guarantee letters for application. (2) Bank acceptance will be developed in the second step when the time is ripe. However, in order to be prepared for any eventuality, bank acceptance bill of exchange forms and acceptance contracts are now drafted for research and preparation. The reason for holding it is to prevent credit expansion, poor flow of goods, and very little that can actually be used for acceptance guarantee. (3) Commercial acceptance bills of exchange may not be popular for a while, and the method of lending urgently needs to be improved. Discounting commercial promissory notes is worth promoting. (4) The bank discount rate, regardless of acceptance bills of exchange and promissory notes, should be lower than the lending rate to promote it. (5) The acceptance discount business should be carried out simultaneously with the national bank's rediscount, and its interest rate should be announced by the national bank at any time.</p>
<p>Various Documents</p>

<h3>Annual Meeting of Money Industry Remittance Houses Discuss Matters That Should Be Promoted and Reformed</h3>

For goods sold from the 20th to the 29th or the end of the month, payment must be made at the end of the month with a ten-day bill of exchange. (2) For goods sold according to North regulations, the goods must be delivered today and paid for tomorrow, but a ten-day bill of exchange may also be used. (3) If the goods were delivered and paid for on the spot in the past, the previous example will still be followed and no changes will be made.</p>
<h3>Junhua Jushengtang (峻化聚善堂) Continues to Distribute Congee on Time</h3>
<p>Junhua Jushengtang (峻化聚善堂) on Wenshi Lane (文監師路) in this city has always been very serious about running public welfare and charity. Since it started distributing congee last year to benefit the poor, the number of recipients has been very large. Its registration procedures have been well recognized by all parties. It has recently been reported that even in this time of extreme food shortage, the hall, mindful of the large number of poor and destitute people, continues to distribute congee on time in an orderly manner.</p>
<h3>Huashang Paper Mill Association Established to Eliminate Black Market for Newsprint</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency (中央社) Shanghai reported that the price of newsprint sold in the market recently has soared and the black market has been raising prices and hoarding goods, which has had a huge impact on the press and businesses. In view of this, the authorities should adjust and limit prices and order paper mills to organize associations in order to investigate the cost statistics of various newspapers and legally limit prices. It is reported that the paper mills used to be managed by the Sino-Japanese Joint Association, but now they have all withdrawn and automatically organized a paper mill association. The internal organization has been completed and the establishment has been announced. The directors and supervisors have also been elected, with Shao Mengshi as the chairman, and Zhang Nairen and Xu Jingxian as the directors, and submitted to the authorities for filing. A Chinese merchant joint business office has also been organized and is currently actively preparing for its establishment. In the future, the newspapers produced by various factories will be sold by the office in a unified manner, so hoarding will be impossible, and the black market will be naturally suppressed.</p>

<h3>Special Compilation of Various Places in Nanyang, Part Four: A Comprehensive Discussion of Malaya (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Voters</p>
<p>Before the Greater East Asia War, the political structure of the Malay Peninsula was as follows: (1) The Straits Settlements were directly governed territories ruled by a governor appointed by the British Emperor. (2) The Federated Malay States were protectorates with nominally independent monarchs, while administrative power, except for religious matters, was held by British state residents. (3) The Unfederated Malay States were guided by British advisors and protected by Britain under treaties. The governor of British Malaya not only ruled the central territories and protectorates but also governed British North Borneo, Sarawak, Brunei, and other places. The administrative organization was as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Legislation: The governor exercised legislative power assisted by the Legislative Council, but had the power to approve, reject, or reserve bills passed by the Legislative Council at his discretion.</p>
<p>The Legislative Council consisted of the governor, thirteen official members (eleven being ex-officio, the other two appointed by the governor), and thirteen unofficial members (eleven elected from districts, the other two recommended by the Singapore and Penang chambers of commerce).</p>
<p>(B) Administration: Central administration was based in Singapore, governed by the Colonial Secretary. The Governor was assisted by the Executive Council, and issued orders through the Colonial Secretary. The Governor was not required to consult on matters deemed unimportant and had the power to veto Council decisions. In terms of local administration, Singapore was directly governed by the Straits Settlements government, while Penang and Malacca were governed by resident councilors.</p>
<p>The composition of the Executive Council was similar to that of the Legislative Council, with six ex-officio official members (excluding the Governor), two official members, and three unofficial members (one recommended by each of the Singapore and Penang chambers of commerce, and one representative of the Chinese community), totaling twelve members.</p>
<p>(C) Judiciary: The judicial system of the Straits Settlements was limited to first, second, and third instances, with the final appeal to the Privy Council in Britain. The Supreme Court also handled first and second instance cases, conducting circuit courts in Singapore, Penang, and Malacca. The scope of the judiciary was very broad. Below the High Court were district courts and police courts.</p>
<p>The above describes the political structure of the Straits Settlements. The Federated Malay States (protectorates), including Perak, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, and Pahang, were ruled by a "High Commissioner" who was concurrently the Governor of the Straits Settlements, assisted by the Federal Council, and managed by a Federal Secretary.</p>
<p>The legislative bodies of the Federated Malay States were the Federal Council and the State Councils. The Federal Council was the central legislature of the Federated Malay States, similar in structure to the Straits Settlements Legislative Council, but allowing Malay participation in the unofficial membership, with no more than one to four members from each state. The State Councils were local legislatures, composed of the Sultans of each state, British Residents, official members, and unofficial members, similar to the Federal Council.</p>
<p>In terms of administration, the governing body of the Federated Malay States was located in Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, with an organization roughly similar to that of the Straits Settlements. The highest administrative power in the states nominally belonged to the Sultans, but the Sultans consulted with British Residents on all matters, so real power was in British hands.</p>
<p>The judicial system was largely modeled after the Straits Settlements, with courts of appeal and lower courts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Unfederated Malay States were protectorates, including Johor, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan, and Terengganu. The rulers of each state were nominally kings and chieftains, but British advisors had the authority of virtual emperors, and foreign affairs were handled by Britain. The Governor of the Straits Settlements also served as High Commissioner for these states, as in the Federated Malay States. Legislation, administration, and justice were also modeled after the Federated Malay States.</p>
<p>(4) Finance and Banking</p>
<p>In British Malaya, the budget of the Straits Settlements was approved by the Legislative Council, decided by the Governor, and then submitted to the British government for approval. In the Federated Malay States, the budget was approved by the Federal Council and could be implemented after being decided by the High Commissioner. The budgets of the Unfederated Malay States were determined separately by their respective state councils.</p>
<p>(1) Recent Revenue and Expenditure Statements for the Straits Settlements (in thousands of US dollars). Revenue and Expenditure Breakdown for 1938 (in thousands of US dollars).</p>
<p>(2) Revenue and Expenditure Statements for the Federated Malay States (in thousands of US dollars).</p>
<p>Revenue mainly came from customs duties, accounting for about half, with the rest from excise taxes, land and mining revenues, public utilities such as electricity and water, and court fees. Expenditure included public debt payments, pensions, medical and healthcare expenses, public works, municipal expenses, postal and telegraph fees, etc.</p>
<p>(3) Financial Situation of the Unfederated Malay States (in Straits dollars).</p>
<p>The largest sources of revenue for each state were customs and excise taxes, followed by land rent, opium tax, and municipal revenue. Expenditure mainly included personnel expenses and public works.</p>
<p>The major exports and imports of British Malaya were rubber and tin, commodities with fluctuating export periods. Therefore, the financial sector did not have specific peak or off-peak seasons. However, Malaya was also a major distribution center and entrepôt for products from across Southeast Asia, making it the most important financial center in the region. The financial center of Malaya was naturally Singapore, where financial institutions from around the world were concentrated. Penang, Malacca, Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, and Seremban were smaller local financial centers. The first type of financial institution in Malaya was banks. There were six Chinese banks, five British banks, three Japanese banks, two Dutch banks, and one each from the United States and France, totaling seventeen. British banks, especially Chartered Bank and HSBC, held the most advantageous position, managing local finances and remittances on behalf of the government, state governments, and various autonomous bodies, making them a central financial force. Foreign banks mainly specialized in remittance services. The major banks in Malaya before the Greater East Asia War are listed below:</p>
<p>(A) British Banks: (1) Chartered Bank, authorized capital of £3 million, reserves of £3 million; (2) HSBC, authorized capital of HK$50 million, reserves of HK$20 million; (3) Mercantile Bank, authorized capital of £3 million, reserves of £1,249,097; (4) P. &amp; O. Banking Corp., Ltd, authorized capital of £5 million, reserves of £1.8 million; (5) Eastern Bank, authorized capital of £2 million, reserves of £900,000; (6) The Cook &amp; Son, Ltd, capital not translated.</p>
<p>(B) Chinese Banks: (1) Sze Hai Tong Banking &amp; Insurance Co., Ltd, capital of Straits $2 million, reserves of Straits $2.9 million; (2) Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation, capital of Straits $40 million; (3) Lee Wah Bank, capital of Straits $10 million; (4) Kwong Yik Selangor Banking Corp., Ltd, Straits $1 million; (5) Kwang Lee Bank, capital unknown; (6) United Chinese Bank, capital unknown. In addition, there were branches of the Bank of China.</p>
<p>(C) Japanese Banks: (1) Bank of Taiwan, capital of ¥15 million; (2) Yokohama Specie Bank, capital of ¥100 million, reserves of ¥102.5 million; (3) Hua Nan Commercial Bank, capital of ¥2.5 million.</p>
<p>(D) Dutch Banks: (1) Nederlandsch Indische Handelsbank, capital of 100 million guilders, reserves of 27,687,000 guilders; (2) Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij, capital of 65,030,000 guilders, reserves of 5 million guilders.</p>
<p>(E) American and French Banks: (1) The First National City Bank of New York, capital of US$150 million, reserves of US$30 million; (2) Banque de l'Indochine, also known as the Banque Franco-Chinoise, capital of 150 million francs, reserves of 124,943,327 francs.</p>
<p>Auxiliary financial institutions included the post office savings banks of the Straits Settlements, the Federated Malay States, and the federal government, chettiar (main financial institutions below the middle class, run by Indians at high interest rates), hui (main financial institutions for small and medium-sized industrial and commercial businesses), pawnshops (mostly operated by overseas Chinese), and letter offices (established by overseas Chinese, specializing in remittances to their hometowns). The recent post office savings amounts were as follows (unit: thousands of US dollars):</p>
<p>The currency system of British Malaya was the gold exchange standard. According to the Currency Act of 1906, 60 Straits dollars equaled £7, or one Straits dollar equaled two shillings and four pence. In 1923, a new currency law was implemented, with gold coins becoming nominal currency and silver coins (in small amounts), cupro-nickel coins, and bronze coins mainly in circulation, supplemented by banknotes accounting for about 80% of the total. The London market price was set at selling one dollar for two shillings, four pence and 3/16ths, and buying at two shillings, three pence and 3/8ths.</p>
<p>The reserves for banknotes issued in the Straits Settlements were divided into coins and securities. The former were Straits dollars and pounds sterling, with a minimum reserve of one-half of the issuance amount. The latter were limited to those issued in Britain and its colonies, with a minimum reserve of one-third of the banknote issuance amount. For banknotes issued by banks, HSBC required a 30% hard currency reserve. The circulating amounts of currency were as follows:</p>
<h3>Police Directly Issue Licenses, Bicycle Theft Cases Can Be Eliminated; Report Stolen Vehicles to Police Immediately</h3>
<p>To prevent bicycle theft, the Public Concession authorities transferred the issuance of bicycle licenses from the Department of Revenue to the Police Department for direct handling one week ago.</p>
<p>Careful and Detailed Licensing Procedures</p>
<p>Since the Police Department began issuing bicycle licenses for the first quarter of this year in mid-month, it has been extremely cautious with all procedures to ensure that reliable information is available for investigating bicycle theft cases in the future. It is reported that each license applicant must provide their Citizen Identification Number and the specifications of their bicycle. If residents experience bicycle theft, the police hope they will immediately report it to the police station, providing the registration number from their application form, so the Police Department can instruct police stations in all districts to be on the lookout for the stolen vehicle.</p>
<p>Tight Security Arrangements Reduce Theft</p>
<p>Furthermore, because the police limit each person to one license, bicycle thieves cannot simply obtain a license from the police after stealing a bicycle. The police can carefully examine the bicycle's specifications and inquire about the purchase location when a person applies for a license. With the implementation of this tight security network, the police authorities stated that the city can be less concerned about bicycle theft, or at least it can be reduced compared to before. They also hope that the public will report the activities of unscrupulous individuals at any time.</p>
<h3>Authorities Approve New Price Limits for Tea Shops</h3>
<p>The Tea Shop Guild of this city stated that current prices are soaring, sources are scarce, and transportation is difficult, reaching a critical point. To protect the capital of businesses and maintain operations, the directors and supervisors repeatedly discussed and drafted a price list for each source of goods, applying to the authorities for approval. The authorities reviewed the list and approved it the other day. The new price limits are for three types of tea – red, green, and scented – each divided into nine grades with equal prices. Grade one is 80 yuan, grade two is 64 yuan, grade three is 48 yuan, grade four is 32 yuan, grade five is 24 yuan, grade six is 16 yuan, grade seven is 12.8 yuan, grade eight is 8 yuan, and grade nine is 6.4 yuan, all calculated per catty. The price list has been printed and distributed to all member businesses to follow when selling, and exceeding the limit is prohibited.</p>
<p>Asphalt Felt Industry Holds Inaugural Meeting</p>
<p>The authorities, to comprehensively adjust the selling prices of all industries, facilitate cost investigation and statistics, and set price limits, have instructed each industry to organize guilds. The asphalt felt industry in this city has not had a guild organization. Preparations are now complete, and the inaugural meeting will be held tomorrow (the 26th) at 2 PM in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to elect the first board of directors and supervisors. Representatives from various institutions will attend to provide guidance. All businesses in the asphalt felt industry that have not yet joined must complete the membership formalities before March 10 to jointly seek benefits for the industry.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Reporter Group's Impressions of Visiting the Clearing Villages Area</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Reporter Group, invited by the Shanghai Branch of the Clearing Villages Committee to visit the Shanghai Clearing Villages Area, spent yesterday (the 24th) as the third day of their on-site observation.

At 10 AM, they arrived in Minhang. The entire group crossed the river directly to Nanqiao, arriving in Nanqiao Town at 10:30 AM. Kuang Hongzao, the Commissioner of the Fengxian Special District, personally greeted them with Captain Li of the Police Brigade. The wharf across from Minhang and in front of Nanqiao Town were decorated with colorful arches, and banners welcoming the reporter group were displayed throughout the area, making the atmosphere even more enthusiastic. They first visited the Fengxian Special District Commissioner's Office, led by Commissioner Kuang to tour the various departments.

Officials and civilians gathered along the way, holding flags and setting off firecrackers to express their welcome to the District Office, where they were received by Director Zhang Yuemin. He reported to the reporter group on the town's commercial situation after the clearing villages. Although the town is small, covering three li with a population of over 13,000, it is located in a strategic location. The entire town is organized into 118 baos, and commerce is thriving. The streets are clean and tidy, making it one of the best small towns. They then visited the Yanze Unit and the Third Brigade of the Police Headquarters. At 4 PM, they left Zhuangxing and headed east towards Beiqiao.</p>
<p>Beiqiao: The Beiqiao District Office, in conjunction with the District Party Headquarters, the Second Regiment of the Security Force, and the Police Bureau, welcomed them at the Minhang Wharf. Red banners welcoming the reporters were hung on both sides of the Shanghai-Minhang South Development Road. They then went to the Beiqiao District Special District Office, where Commissioner Zhu Zhongxian, Brigade Commander Hu Cheng, and Director Liu Yunfang successively welcomed them. Commissioner Zhu elaborated on the detailed situation of the district after the clearing villages. They then visited the Security Force, the Beiqiao District Party Headquarters, and the Police Bureau. They also visited the Tax Management Office, the Sealing Management Bureau, and the Minhang District Office, and conducted general inspections of cooperatives. The entire trip concluded at this point. Over the past three days, the reporter group visited Nanhui, Zhoupu, Fengzhi, Nanzha, Zhuangxing, Beiqiao, etc., covering a total distance of 158 kilometers. In summary, the local areas within the clearing villages rely on the cooperation of the party, government, military, and civilians to establish security. They also witnessed the efforts of officials and civilians in the clearing villages area to promote rural construction, which was very encouraging. The reporter group received a warm welcome wherever they went. The Shanghai Branch of the Qingxiang Committee will hold a discussion meeting today, the 25th, to invite the reporter group to share their observations and impressions.</p>

<h3>Unified Economic Policy After the Return of the French Concession</h3>
<p>The Chinese economic community has expressed their support for the French government's return of the French Concession in Shanghai. The following is a summary of various opinions:</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the French Concession authorities have shown a friendly attitude towards both China and Japan, assisting in the takeover of enemy assets from the United States and Britain. At the same time, French economic institutions such as the Sino-French Industrial and Commercial Bank and the Banque de l'Indochine have consistently assisted in the work of the Central Reserve Bank, curbing prices and distributing goods. Therefore, the announcement of the return of the French Concession will not only not cause any changes to the city's economy, but will also ensure the smooth promotion of various economic policies due to the unification of administrative institutions.</p>
<p>In addition, it is reported that the French government announced on the 23rd that it would relinquish administrative control over the French Concession in Shanghai. This move has a positive impact on Shanghai's economy. The financial community of the city has high hopes for the future new administration of the National Government. Although the French Concession authorities have supported the Japanese policy and cooperated in controlling the economy in the past, their independent administrative power has prevented them from achieving consistent economic control. With the abolition of the concession, administrative inconveniences will be eliminated, and Shanghai's economic control will be unified. The control of prices and materials will also be promoted in a more rational manner.</p>

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>The Mission of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association</h3>
<p>There is an old Chinese saying: "People have the same heart, and hearts share the same reason." Regardless of race, nationality, or gender, humans share the same heart and the same reason. Furthermore, humans are rich in emotions, so there is an ancient Chinese saying: "Those who subdue people with virtue are sincerely convinced." Under the same psychology and within the same emotions, it seems that there is nothing that cannot be understood tacitly and nothing that cannot be discussed with emotion.</p>
<p>Therefore, we feel that the organization of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association is by no means a product of chance—or a coincidence—but is actually based on valuable principles of sociology and has emerged to adapt to the current social environment. Its sole objective lies in "communicating the will of the Chinese and Japanese industrial and commercial circles." The so-called "will" naturally includes each other's psychology and emotions.</p>
<p>Since the National Government entered the war, both Chinese and Japanese authorities have strived to establish a wartime joint system, adopting coordinated steps in all matters, truly doing their utmost in cooperation. Especially in the economic field, this spirit of cooperation is increasingly evident and revealed. However, even if we don't talk about economic problems, the resolution of economic—which are also social—problems relies solely on the efforts and cooperation of the two governments, which is still not enough. It is necessary for appropriate figures from both sides to assume the same responsibility, sincerely interact with each other, and jointly strive to discuss and resolve the thousands of problems in the private economic sector.</p>
<p>Therefore, the mission of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association is less about communicating the emotions of people in the industrial and commercial sectors of the two countries, and more about promoting cooperation between the private economic sectors of China and Japan. The author wishes to take advantage of today's opportunity of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association welcoming Minister Tajiri and Consul General Yano to embellish these few words in the "Economic Circle" section of this newspaper, as our outlook for the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association—hoping that the historians of both countries can record the beautiful achievements of the cooperation between the private economic sectors of the two countries in the future history of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, making it the most glorious page.</p>
<h3>Goods That Have Already Paid Consolidated Tax Are Allowed to Be Freely Transported and Sold Domestically, But Must Be Accompanied by Tax Payment Certificates</h3>
<p>After cotton yarn, matches, and other goods subject to consolidated tax were designated as national taxes and changed to ad valorem collection, all those imported from abroad, in addition to import duties collected by customs, should be subject to consolidated tax in accordance with the provisions of the Consolidated Tax Regulations. Those who have already paid consolidated tax are allowed to be freely transported and sold domestically, and no other taxes will be levied except for customs duties when re-exported. Goods such as cotton yarn and matches that have already paid consolidated tax must be accompanied by a certificate of consolidated tax payment when transported and sold in any area within the country; violators will be treated as tax evasion.</p>
<h3>Commercial Registration in Various Counties of Jiangsu to Begin on the First of Next Month</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government authorities, in view of the gradual recovery of commerce in various places amidst the war since the Incident, and the inevitable emergence of chaos and other unreasonable phenomena, ordered all counties to conduct commercial registration through the Department of Construction, in order to have a detailed understanding of the number of stores, business conditions, and material situation in various places, and to supervise them at any time. It is reported that the Department of Construction's preparations for the commercial registration have been largely completed, so it has been decided that all counties will begin registration simultaneously from March 1. A large number of commercial registration certificates printed by the Department of Construction will also be distributed to the counties for use within days.</p>
<h3>Unification of the Money Trade, the Name of the Remittance Qianzhuang</h3>
<p>The member firms of the Money Trade Association were formerly known as Huikua Qianzhuang, while those who were not members were divided into Yuan, Heng, Li, Zhen, etc. At the annual meeting held the day before yesterday, upon the suggestion of the member firms, all member firms of the association should uniformly be named as "So-and-so Huikua Qianzhuang" to preserve the Huikua money trade with hundreds of years of history. This was approved and implemented. Therefore, in the future, all member firms joining the association will add the words "Huikua" to their names for identification. As for the former partnership organizations of various firms, in order to comply with government laws and regulations, they are required to be completely reorganized into company organizations before August 20. Therefore, afterwards, Huikua Qianzhuang will be the same as banks, all being company organizations.</p>
<h3>The Bond Market Is Uneasy, with Huge Fluctuations</h3>
<p>The public debt market was still quite volatile yesterday, with people still feeling uneasy and uncertain. The volume of transactions was limited, but the fluctuations were quite large. The initial price of Category C bonds was 7 yuan 34 cents, rising to 8 yuan, then suddenly falling back to within 5 yuan, then rising again to about 6 yuan, and finally settling at 4 yuan 23 cents. This volatility is enough to reflect the uneasiness of the people. The bullish trend was therefore frustrated, and other categories of bonds, such as A, B, and E, had some market value, with A being around 3 yuan and E being around 1 yuan, but with very few transactions.</p>
<h3>Bank of Communications Plans Rural Lending</h3>
<p>According to the China Intelligence Front, the Bank of Communications is actively preparing for rural lending work. The bank has recently sent two rural economic survey teams to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line, the Beijing-Shanghai Line, the Beijing-Wuhu Line and other places to investigate the rural economic situation as a reference for implementing the lending plan. It is reported that the bank's lending policy is to directly contact cooperatives and strive to eliminate middlemen from profiting from it. When the lending work begins to be implemented in the future, the bank may establish a general office for rural lending to manage the matter, but this is only a plan, and whether it will be established has not yet been decided. As for how to raise the funds to be released, it is still under discussion. If the situation permits, it may issue such and such.</p>
<p>Economic Statistics</p>
<h3>Total Number of Factories and Workers in This City</h3>
<p>According to the Mainland News, according to a survey at the end of last year, there were 1,145 factories in this city, with 120,000 workers (excluding military management). The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Silk industry 58, iron and mechanical industry 251, non-ferrous metals 31, metals 76, electrical appliances 33</p>
<p>Flour milling 12, food 28, leather making 12, printing 56, paper making 36</p>
<p>Chemical industry 105, tobacco 26, soap 19, matches 12, kiln industry 59</p>
<p>Rubber industry 33, textile industry 112, timber and miscellaneous industries 55. Compared with before the Incident, the number of factories has decreased by two-thirds (formerly 3,485), and the number of workers has decreased by one-half (formerly about 250,000).</p>
<h3>The Development of Currency Work in Central China (4)</h3>
<p>Fourth, from the perspective of social policy, the two-unit currency system only grants undue benefits to speculators and qianzhuang banks, causing the general public to spend some extra commissions in vain. In terms of salaries, although the salaried class who have already received salaries in old legal tender and military notes have been converted to savings certificates, it is questionable whether the conversion is based on the official exchange rate in the general market. Moreover, there are still many sectors in society where military notes must be used for consumption. In this sense, the two-unit system or two-unit system is also very unfavorable to salaried class people.</p>
<p>Fifth, from the perspective of establishing the position of the National Government, the two-unit currency system is not a good system either. The National Government recently issued the Republic of China's 31st Year Financial Stability Public Bonds, which aims to prevent inflation in order to obtain funds, and also ordered the Central Reserve Bank to accept the deposit reserve funds turned in by various banks, starting to control the financial sector, which will inevitably encounter some difficulties! From the perspective of thoroughly completing the National Government's economic work and establishing its position, it is also necessary to change the two-unit currency system to a one-unit system.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, the currency in the Peace Zone, which constitutes the economic core of Central China, is demanding a one-unit system from all perspectives. In the case of implementing a one-unit system, if the trolley ticket, which occupies a deep-rooted position in Central China, is regarded as the absolutely unified currency and is tied to the Japanese yen at par, although some people advocate this, based on today's objective situation, it should no longer be proposed as a topic for discussion. However, when considering the relationship between our country and the National Government, as well as the broader supreme ideal of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, it is also felt that it is imperative.

<p>Economic Lecture</p>
<h3>Discussing Current Price Countermeasures from the Principles of Economics</h3>
<p>— Lou Chen</p>
<p>In economic terminology, the price is called the value of goods. Economists believe that the difference in the value of goods is due to the different identification of humans with the satisfaction of various desires. According to the economic thought of Carl Menger, the founder of the Austrian School, the value of goods and its measurement are both subjective and shift with desires, while the amount of labor or capital spent on production has no direct or necessary relationship with the value of goods. Although Menger's explanation of the value of goods somewhat acknowledges social influence, he ultimately views the value of goods as an individual phenomenon and believes that the value of goods is often separated and independent from society and law.</p>
<p>The author believes that discussing the issue of price—that is, the value of goods—theoretically must recognize two eras: the ordinary era and the extraordinary era—or peacetime and wartime. Menger's first type of theory—that is, price shifts with individual desires—can be said to be a reasonable view in both ordinary and extraordinary times. However, his belief that price has no direct or necessary relationship with the amount of labor or capital spent on production, I believe, does not seem entirely reasonable in either ordinary or extraordinary times, because price ultimately has some direct relationship with the amount of labor or capital spent on production. This is true in ordinary times, and especially true in extraordinary times. For example, wartime is an extraordinary era, and among the many factors in the rise of wartime prices, the two factors of labor and capital spent on wartime production cannot be excluded. Because the price of labor during wartime increases with the upward movement of workers' cost of living index, and the price of capital during wartime also increases with the upward estimation of material prices.</p>
<p>Speaking from Menger's second type of theory—that is, the value of goods is an individual phenomenon, and it is believed that the value of goods is often separated and independent from society and law. The author believes that these two sentences do indeed contain profound truths, especially the second sentence, because prices in peacetime often separate and become independent from society and law, and during wartime, they separate further and become even more independent from society and law. In other words, the ferocity of wartime price increases absolutely does not consider social welfare, nor does it consider legal sanctions. As a result, the price surge becomes limitless, creating serious phenomena in society and serious problems in law.</p>
<p>From the economic principles discussed above, it can be known that the rise in prices in extraordinary periods—or wartime—can be attributed to three main factors: (1) Because the cost of labor, living, and capital increases simultaneously during wartime, prices also increase as a result; (2) Because prices are further separated from society, prices not only do not suppress their rising trend due to the social environment (the weakness of people's purchasing power), but also use the social environment (the increase in the need for goods) to help their rising trend; (3) Because prices are further separated from the law, the laws controlling prices are often controlled by the trend of prices. As a result, the law is the law, and the price is the price.</p>
<p>Based on the three main factors just mentioned, I believe that the countermeasures to limit prices—although the detailed methods are numerous—can really be summarized into three basic principles:</p>
<p>(1) From the perspective of production, the limitation of prices must refer to and be based on the cost of producers. The price limit cannot be not strict, nor can it be too strict. Because if the price limit is not strict, the prices of goods will inevitably be in a situation of each doing its own thing, with some high and some low, unable to obtain a comprehensive and unified price limit standard, which is also the source of extra profits for merchants. If the price limit is too strict, then producers, seeing that costs are at a loss, and sellers, seeing that profits are too thin, will create a situation where they are unwilling to manufacture even if they have materials, and unwilling to sell even if they have goods. Therefore, limiting prices must ultimately be based on and refer to the real cost of goods in order to easily achieve significant results.</p>
<p>(2) From the social perspective, the limitation of prices must obtain the full cooperation of society. The urging of public opinion and the outcry of the people are still secondary. The most important thing is that society itself must eradicate all kinds of selfish behaviors—manipulation, hoarding, cornering the market, refusal to sell, etc.—and recognize that society is a combination of people, and if society does not care about prices, the result will be that prices do not care about the people. Therefore, people in society must not only refrain from participating in all kinds of selfish behaviors, but also further report such behaviors by others. At the same time, the powerful in society must pay attention to encouraging production to increase the source of materials, and the powerless must pay attention to saving consumption to reduce the flow of materials. Then, prices will naturally not have unreasonable increases.</p>
<p>(3) From the legal perspective, in extraordinary times, there must be extraordinary laws. Although prices break away from the law and rise without limit, the law can ultimately sanction unreasonable and illegal increases in prices. Controlling prices and cracking down on speculation are, of course, tasks within the scope of the law, and even the rationing system is not necessarily an act within the meaning of the law. Speaking of the rationing system, the author wants to specifically mention one point, that is, rationing must be reasonably universal and sufficient in order to eliminate the phenomenon of merchants monopolizing the market and people relying on the black market for supply.</p>
<p>What this article discusses is not listing the various detailed methods of price limitation countermeasures, but wants to present several basic principles of price limitation countermeasures, hoping that many meticulous and thorough methods can be transformed from these simple outlines. Then, the methods thought of will be "although not in the middle, not far away".</p>
<h3>Weak Market for Tobacco</h3>
<p>As a result, the market atmosphere is weak. Yesterday, British Bee sold for 12,800 yuan, Old Knife brand for 10,700 yuan, Pin Hai brand for 8,400 yuan, Fairy brand for 8,400 yuan, and Five Flowers brand for 7,100 yuan. Japanese cigarettes: Golden Gun brand for 3,400 yuan, Golden Building for 4,200 yuan, Rose for 2,850 yuan, Quan Lu brand for 4,020 yuan, Nian Mei for 3,500 yuan, and Guide brand for 3,400 yuan. National cigarettes: Pyramid for 7,950 yuan, Beauty brand for 7,200 yuan, Golden Mouse brand for 4,450 yuan, and White Golden Dragon for 4,800 yuan. The prices of each product are mostly soft.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association Welcomes Minister Soshiro and Consul General Yano</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association," a joint organization of Chinese and Japanese industrial and commercial figures in this city, in order to express its admiration for the outstanding achievements of Minister Tajiri and Consul General Yano since taking office, held a meeting to welcome them at the Jinmen Hotel on the 9th floor at 4 pm today. The association has recently recruited 50 new members, 25 from China and 25 from Japan. It is said that the qualifications for new members are extremely strict, requiring a considerable reputation in the industrial and commercial circles of Shanghai and the recommendation of two or more members of the association. The Standing Committee of both sides has already approved the selection of 25 Chinese members and 19 Japanese members, who will also be welcomed to join the association at the same time today. In addition, the association's New Year's group worship was previously postponed because the chairman, Wen Lan Ting, was ill and unable to attend. It is now reported that the chairman has recovered his health, so the members' group worship ceremony has also been changed to today to celebrate together.</p>
<h3>Brief Overview of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association</h3>
<p>The industrial and commercial circles of China and Japan in this city, in view of the necessity of friendship between each other, gathered together in August of last year to initiate the organization of the "Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association." Its purpose is to communicate the will of the Chinese and Japanese industrial and commercial circles, and to promote the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere through the cooperation of both sides. The association began preparations in August of last year and was established on September 3. One hundred initiators from both sides (list below) are the basic members, and 36 directors were set up, 18 each from China and Japan. Wen Lan Ting is the chairman, Komuro Takeo is the vice chairman, and there are four standing directors from each side: Wu Yunzhai, Xu Guanqun, Huang Jiangquan, and Lin Kanghou from the Chinese side; Aoki Takashi, Washio Isoichi, Takagaki Katsujiro, and Tsutsumi Takashi from the Japanese side. There are thirteen directors: Jiang Shangda, Wu Zhenxiu, Guo Shun, Tang Shoumin, Yuan Ludeng, Xu Xiaochu, Xiang Kangyuan, Dong Daoning (also secretary), Ye Fuxiao, Li Shengbo, Wang Boyuan (also treasurer), Chen Shaoyu, and Chen Binhe from the Chinese side.

<h3>Foreign Silver Ingots and Flat Bars Are Difficult to Sell in Reality</h3>
<p>Yesterday, new foreign silver ingots, flat bars, and foreign silver ingot tips only had sporadic transactions. There were no wholesale sales to speak of. Due to the weak inventory, prices did not fall. Currently, 2 to 6-point new foreign silver flat bars are priced at 16,000 yuan per ton, 7-point to coarse patterns are priced at 24,000 yuan per ton, and new foreign flat bars are priced at 20,000 yuan per ton. Foreign silver ingot triangular iron tips are priced at 12,000 yuan per ton (prices for the above patterns are subject to slight additions).</p>
<h3>The United States Bans the Sale of Canned Vegetables and Fruits, Only Fresh Fish Is Not Restricted</h3>
<p>Lisbon, February 23, Allied Press Dispatch—Washington news: An unprecedented event in American history is the new method of food control that began last Saturday, namely, all canned English vegetables and fruits are temporarily suspended from sale until March 1, pending the implementation of the full rationing plan. In addition, various foods, such as sugar, coffee, butter, fresh meat, canned meats, and canned fish, must be purchased with ration coupons. Only fresh fish is not restricted.</p>
<h3>The United Currency Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Shanghai Money Trade Association's interbank lending rate was 18 cents, which has not been changed.</p>
<p>Japanese military notes slightly rebounded, but the intention of sugar merchants to collude weakened. Interbank trading was priced at 5 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen 4 li 6 hao, with small qianzhuang and bank retail prices ranging from 5 yuan 5 jiao 4 fen 5 hao and 6 hao, which also slightly rebounded. The United Reserve Bank's notes continued to fall, with operators selling at 3 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen and buying at 3 yuan 7 jiao, a reduction of 3 fen.</p>

<h3>Donkey, Pig, Deer, Horse</h3>
<p>— New</p>
<p>"Emperor Xiaowu had never seen a pig. Xie Da Chuan asked, 'Your Majesty, what do you imagine it looks like?'</p>
<p>Xiaowu laughed and said, 'It must look just like a pig.'" (See "A New Account of the World.")</p>
<p>This anecdote about an Eastern Jin emperor is remarkably similar to the story of Emperor Hui of Western Jin asking whether the croaking of frogs was for public or private matters.</p>
<p>However, the fact that Emperor Xiaowu openly knew about "pigs" can be considered quite remarkable; but perhaps the pig he imagined was one seen from afar on a sacrificial stand during a ritual. With the hair removed, smooth, blood-cleaned, and white, it wouldn't look particularly disgusting, and the height of the sacrificial stand would naturally allow it to be ridden.</p>
<p>This anecdote also proves how unreliable subjective assumptions can be. This is a form of subjectivism. But there's another kind of subjectivism, which is the intentional distortion of objective reality. The most famous story is Zhao Gao's pointing at a deer and calling it a horse.</p>
<p>Mistaking a donkey for a pig stems from ignorance, while calling a deer a horse stems from the misuse of intelligence. The former type of subjectivism can be cured with scientific methods to remedy its foolishness, while the latter type of subjectivism, the more it knows about scientific methods, the more it can enhance its deceit. The same science, humanitarians use it to advance human happiness, while totalitarian despots use it to annihilate humanity. In this context, in addition to scientific methods, there also seems to be a need for moral or political forces as a backing.</p>
<p>Relying solely on compassionate efforts to overcome subjectivism is still not enough.</p>
<p>When Zhao Gao acts strangely, all the deer in the world will become horses.</p>
<p>A pig? Or something even less? (In response to transferring disaster relief funds)</p>

<h3>A Casual Discussion on "Blood Types"</h3>
<p>— Peng Liu</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Each person's heart is different, just as their faces are different." However, it's not just hearts that differ; the blood within each person's body also varies in many ways. Although not as distinct as faces, they are certainly complex.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that blood is red, and there should be no difference, but in reality, there are four types of blood. Everyone's blood must belong to one of these four types, which are medically called the four "blood types" or "blood groups." Their names are: Type A, Type B, Type O, and Type AB. The basis for typing, simply put, is that some blood contains a component that can cause other blood types to clot, while others do not. However, this is a medical issue and not within the scope of this article. What I want to discuss here are the applications of blood types and their relationship to body constitution and personality.</p>
<p>Everyone has a specific blood type that remains unchanged throughout their life, and there is also a hereditary relationship. Children's blood types are determined by their parents' blood types; the children born to a person of a certain blood type marrying a person of another blood type must be of certain types and cannot be of other types. Therefore, if the parents' blood types are known, the possible and impossible blood types of the children can be deduced based on the principles of heredity. This principle is used in forensic medicine to identify family relationships. According to the author's speculation, the method of "dripping blood to test corpses" recorded in ancient Chinese books on forensic medicine may also be related to this.</p>
<p>The second application of blood types is for blood transfusions. To avoid blood clotting, the blood type of the donor must be determined during a blood transfusion. Simply put, if a person with type O blood needs a transfusion, the donor must also be type O. A recipient with type A blood must have a type A or type O donor, a recipient with type B blood must have a type B or type O donor, and a recipient with type AB blood can have a donor of any blood type.</p>
<p>Next, I want to talk about some interesting questions about blood types. According to recent research in the medical field, blood type is not only related to heredity but can also determine a person's constitution and personality. People with type O blood belong to the phlegmatic temperament, more common in men. They have strong self-confidence and willpower, reason prevails over emotion, they rarely hesitate and are not easily deceived, but they are stubborn, not easily accommodating, and lack patience, which are their shortcomings. This is a heroic character, so it is called the "hero type," and most military heroes belong to this type. People with type A blood belong to the melancholic temperament. In psychology, they are introverted, with no significant difference between men and women. They fear hardship, value etiquette, are loyal and honest, have deep and far-reaching thoughts, are persevering and enduring, and have compassion and a spirit of sacrifice, but they are indecisive, prone to suspicion and depression, so they can be called the "thinking type," and most scientists and philosophers belong to this type. Type B blood belongs to the sanguine temperament, more common in women. Their psychology is extroverted, and they act entirely on feeling, so they are the "feeling type," and most socialites, diplomats, and businessmen belong to this type; their strengths are straightforwardness, quick temper, enthusiasm, bravery, agility, eloquence, and good social skills. Their shortcomings are carelessness, exaggeration, capriciousness, volatility, and unreliability. Type AB is a "mixed type," their physique is sanguine on the outside and melancholic on the inside, combining the personalities of type A and type B, so they are difficult to grasp and easily influenced and changed by the environment. Due to this personality, some Japanese medical experts believe that blood type also has an impact on the perfection of occupations and marriages, but this will not lead to this due to different personalities, and blood type is not a direct factor.</p>
<p>From what has been said above, the four blood types represent four "human types." Although each person's heart is as different as their face, they are always like their "blood," not beyond these four types; if each type of human being can recognize their own personality, abandon their weaknesses and take their strengths, and become "perfect people," then the treacherous world where each person's heart is as different as their "face" can also be transformed into a world where each person's heart is as different as their "person," and there is no need to guard against hidden arrows everywhere.</p>
<h3>Small Anecdotes of Shanghai History</h3>
<p>— Bai Hong</p>
<p>The Wen Jian Shi Road in the north of the Public Concession should be called Boone Road based on the English name, so most people call it Boone Road.</p>
<p>Speaking of this Boone, he was a very important historical figure in the Public Concession. He was an American and a priest of the Anglican Church.</p>
<p>In the twenty-eighth year of Daoguang (1848), he led American expatriates to reside in the Hongkou area and, on behalf of the American government, negotiated with the Shanghai Daotai to designate the area as the American Concession. However, the boundaries were not delineated until the second year of Tongzhi (1863), when the American Consul Seward officially agreed with the Shanghai Daotai to designate the area along the Suzhou Creek to the Huangpu River, past Yangshupu, as the American Concession. (The area was much larger than the British Concession at the time.) Later, in September of the same year, due to management issues, it was merged with the British Concession to form the Public Concession, and the American Concession became a historical term.</p>
<p>This is a historical fact about the American Concession in Shanghai, and this Boone was the establisher of the American Concession, one of the predecessors of the Public Concession.</p>
<p>At the time, he was a complete Sinophile. Since his job was as an Anglican missionary, he naturally interacted with Chinese people, so he also had a Chinese name, "Wen Huilian." He was probably already well-known to everyone in Shanghai at the time. Therefore, the concession authorities later used his name for the road to commemorate his achievements. The English name was Boone Road, and the Chinese name was written as Wen Jian Shi Road. As for why a pastor was called a Jian Shi, perhaps the title of pastor was not yet popular at the time, and missionaries were all called Jian Shi, which may be the case. Fortunately, I am now introducing some historical facts, and the titles of pastor and Jian Shi can be left unexamined.</p>
<h3>On the Mentality of Taking Chances</h3>
<p>— E Sheng</p>
<p>The probability of success through luck is so small as to be almost equal to zero, which means that it is simply impossible to achieve success in a career by relying on luck. In the world, there are people who approach the solution of everything with a mentality of taking chances. They want to rely on luck to exempt themselves from all the difficulties on the road to success, thereby achieving twice the result with half the effort and reaping without sowing. Precisely because of this, you see, how many world-shaking heroes who have achieved great feats have there been throughout history? Are many great people destined to be successful great people? No, they all struggled out of hard work! So, if we want to become successful great people, we just need to work hard towards a correct goal. In other words, for anything to be achieved, it must be done on the principle of "one point of effort, one point of achievement." As for the mentality of taking chances, it is best not to let it sneak into your mind even for a second.</p>
<p>However, are there really no people in the world who have achieved success through luck? Yes, there are. However, all success obtained through luck is not permanent, and the success they have obtained will never last to the end. Their success is only a stay or paragraph on the "road of taking chances." Ultimately, this cannot escape failure. This is simply because their success is entirely unearned. Because they have not worked for it, they have never broken a thorny branch, let alone encountered any difficulties, so they have no idea what difficulties are, let alone tasted what hardship is like. Once they are slightly tortured, all their efforts are abandoned and they fail, which is a failure that falls short of success.</p>
<p>Those speculators who were once so prominent in Shanghai not long ago were the group of people who held onto the mentality of taking chances most firmly. Their goal was to get rich. Indeed, they easily shouted "buy and sell" by the phone, and the money in their pockets did increase, and there could not be a better shortcut to wealth. But can their money really be inexhaustible from their pockets for a lifetime? Can wealth obtained through improper means guarantee that it will not be lost soon? This is the most serious problem. As I see it, they are only enjoying themselves temporarily. Why? Because they speculate entirely because they are driven by the mentality of taking chances. They cannot withstand three days of wind and four days of rain, and their little achievements will still be washed away. However, people who have already had some achievements and then abandon all their efforts because they continue to hold on to the mentality of taking chances are still relatively lucky. The most fearful are those who are "unlucky as soon as they go out," those who take chances. I think it is better for someone who has been there to describe the taste of their failure and fall.</p>
<h3>Fifth Place in January Essay Contest - My Life (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Yu Huizhen</p>
<p>Humans are not purely incorporeal beings made of spirit. To maintain the driving force of the trunk, one must rely on material nutrition and conditioning. Therefore, humans cannot live transcendently away from matter. For the sake of matter, how many innocent souls have been trapped? They have obliterated their nature, erased their innocence, failed to hear the unique journey they have, and fallen into the abyss of vulgar life.</p>
<p>Friends! Let us examine ourselves to see if our own life torrent has also changed its original course. Of course, who has no ideals? Who has no desires? How can these buds of hope stand independently apart from wealth and fame? Therefore, no one dares to loudly say that they absolutely do not love wealth and fame. Only under possible material enjoyment, without extinguishing their unique nature, without being a captive of profit, is it a rare transcendence and independence. Then, friends! Bravely tear off a page of your life history and boldly state it among the vast and countless strangers. Do not be timid, do not cover up.</p>
<p>I am like a common bacterium that cannot be seen even under a microscope magnified thousands of times, attached to the majestic and tall pine trunk. Covered with evergreen leaves all year round, the rain and wind will never devastate me. Here, I have spent a full nineteen years in ordinariness. Every day, I only need to open my mouth and reach out my hand, without having to worry about the high cost of living, to fulfill my obligations; but I frankly admit that my nature will not change because of the comfort of life. I have a father worthy of pride. He not only simply provides his children with material needs but also understands how to instill the elements of life into his children—spiritual training. Under this great paternal love and guidance, we intimately experience the true meaning of the joy of life, and we automatically realize the instinctive spirit of universal love. In any situation, there always seems to be a pure love that pushes the torrent of one's own life and always maintains its original course.</p>
<p>In recent years, because of the heavy burden of life, my father's temples have almost turned white. But he still has a strong and majestic physique and never mentions the difficulties of family finances to his children. My family has no traditional ancestral property, and my father did not have good educational opportunities when he was young. In today's era of widespread famine and wind and rain throughout the city, our family of more than ten people can still obtain normal and appropriate nutrition every day. How can we not reveal the spirit of natural training from my father's perseverance and hard work? Therefore, I do not have the spoiled and bad nature of a typical young lady of the boudoir, nor do I have the supposed extravagance that college students should have. On the contrary, I try my best to increase my habit of frugality. Perhaps some people say, stingy!</p>
<p>The Joy of Reading - Replacing Recreation with Reading (By Tianming)</p>
<h3>The Model Teacher for All Ages</h3>
<p>— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>(17)</p>
<p>Mrs. Wicket had gone out, to visit relatives in a neighboring village; she had left tea things set out on the table, with bread and butter, and an extra cup in case of visitors. But visitors were unlikely on such a day; the mist outside was thickening every minute, and probably he would just have to sit through it alone.</p>
<p>But no. About a quarter to four the bell rang, and Chips himself went to the front door (which was a thing he ought not to have done), and found a small boy, wearing a Brookfield house cap, with his hair plastered sleekly down. "Please, sir," he said: "does Mr. Chips live here?"</p>
<p>"Uhhuh—you'd better come inside," said Chips. Presently, in his sitting-room, he added: "I am—uhhuh—the person you want. Now what can I—uhhuh—do for you?"</p>
<p>"Someone told me you would cane me, sir."</p>
<p>Chips smiled. An old joke—an old piece of cheek that amused him, because, having said so many old jokes himself, he could hardly complain. It cheered him up to think that his name was still good for a laugh; showed them, even now, he wasn't quite down and out. So he twinkled and said: "Quite right, my boy. I am going to have tea with you. Will you—uhhuh—sit down by the fire? I—uhhuh—don't think I've seen you before. What's your name?"</p>
<p>"Linford, sir—and I've only just come out of the sanatorium—I had measles at the beginning of term."</p>
<p>"Oh, I see."</p>
<p>Chips began to fuss with the ritual of tea-making from the caddy; luckily, there was half a walnut cake with some glacé cherries on top in the pantry. He found out that Linford came from Shropshire, and that he was the first of his family to come to Brookfield. (46)</p>

<h3>Medical Aid for Elementary School Teachers: Hoping for a Steady Stream of Support from All Sides</h3>
<p>Our newspaper's "Medical Aid Fund for Elementary School Teachers" has received enthusiastic responses from all sides,</p>
<p>"Those with money contribute money, those with strength contribute strength." We thank Mr. Tan for his generous donation of one thousand yuan yesterday, which has been deposited. It is noted that elementary school teachers are often overworked and underpaid, and poor nutrition often leads to illness. They are unable to afford medical treatment and suffer greatly. For example, our newspaper received a health survey form from a certain elementary school yesterday, showing that out of eleven teachers, only three were strong, while the other seven suffered from neurasthenia, insomnia, stomach problems, lung disease, or anemia, which shows the seriousness of the health of elementary school teachers in general. The establishment of our newspaper's medical aid fund is entirely adapted to the needs of the environment. It is hoped that all parties will continue to carry forward the spirit of mutual assistance and enthusiastically contribute, so as to achieve the goal of 200,000 yuan as soon as possible, so that elementary school teachers in general can benefit as soon as possible, which will be of immeasurable merit. We also hope that all schools will fill out and send in health survey forms for teachers and staff for reference.</p>
<h3>Ximen Women and Children's Hospital: Preferential Treatment for Elementary School Teachers</h3>
