<h3>戰時與平時</h3>
<p>戰時與平時，似為對立之名詞，而不可相提並論者。但二者均為任何民族生存史上相互交替之時期，故雖其方式各異，然自有其共同之耍素興夫彼此連鎖之關繫。若不參透此中之眞諦，則民族可在此任何一種時期中，徬徨失措，進退無據，而動盪飄搖趨於毀滅。</p>
<p>戰時之特微為緊張與艱苦，平時之特徽為從容與優裕，此為二者表面上之差異。但無論在戰時與平時，各個人之思想行動，應以整個民族之生存為前提，使其前途安全而光明，故在其表面的差異之下而具有內在的共同要素。因此吾人處於平時，允宜利用其從容優裕之環境，而以卓絕勤勉之精神，靳求充分的休養生息，以培植應付驟變之實力。至於處於戰時，自當適應緊張艱苦之情緒，而以鎭靜嚴肅之格調，謀取最後的光榮勝利，以保留復興建設之元氣。是以平時不能忘戰時，以免因從容優裕而趨於昏淫，戰時不能忘平時，以免因緊張艱苦而漸致怨亂。昏淫怨亂之後果，皆足以毀滅整個民族之生命。吾放曰：處「平」如「戰」，處「戰」如「平」，乃謀民族生存之金科玉律，藉此亦足以深知二者連鎖關繫之重要性。</p>
<p>在最近百年中，我國歷史上已經過若干次戰時與平時之更迭。惟其在每次更迭之中，均未能把握時機好自為之，故經過每一次戰時必增加許多恥辱，而經過每一次平時必摧殘許多實力。物腐虫生，遂引起外界之挑撥與離問利誘與威脅，而喪失生存自主之能力，積弱之現象，豈偶然栽！</p>
<p>往者已矣，來者可追。自六年前中日事變以來，其中雖因國府還都而有一度和平之階段，但以參加大東亞戰爭重復步入更偉大更重要之戰時狀態。時至今日已漸至決勝時期，亦即漸達戰爭之最高峯。試檢討上海一隅最近之情形，實有足以使人猛省者。就教育界言，主持教育之當局，從事教育之教師，身受教育之男女學生，莫不泄泄沓沓，毫無緊張艱苦之表現。就經濟界言，統制之呼聲愈高唱，物價之上漲愈瘋狂，黑市之暗盤愈猖獗，統制之目的在平均分配節約物質，其結果則為壟斷居奇囤積浪費。由此而造成生產之銳減，貧困之日甚。此外一切的一切無論在生活上服務上毫無鎭靜嚴肅之表現，所有措施一若以消滅後方之實力摧毀民間之元氣為目的，而求其萬刦不復以使敵人稱快者。自前年十二月八日以後，英美勢力自整個東亞掃蕩無餘，此等腐化墮落之事實，當不復能諉為外來之原因。</p>
<p>大東亞同盟成立，為大東亞集團共存共榮之具體事實，謀集團之健全，須求各個分子之健全，倘上海一隅之社會無了解戰時特質之智能，更無處「戰」如「平」之毅力，而以強凌弱之手段，混水撈魚之心理，認戰時之怨亂為正常，則其他各處更不洪設想，大東亞戰爭後方之大部分必均蒙其惡劣之影響。以中國立塲言，應趕速體念目前戰時之現狀與夫此後平時之自處，更須澈悟戰時與平時之連鎖性，力求振拔而掃除一切不可解不合理之畸形醜態，發揮其東亞一員所應貢獻之力量。否則不僅自誤，抑且有累盟邦以及整個大東亞！</p>
<h3>本年內議事完畢日議會下月在開　兩院昨通過感謝陸海軍案</h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　日貴族院二十七日上午十時另四分召開全體會議，討論勅語奉答文案，由松平議長將奉答文朗言後，全體起立一致予以通過，至十時卅一分暫時休息，十時五十三分重開，松平議長為晉宮呈遞勳語奉答文，臨時退席，由佐佐木副議長代表議長，請求東條首相兼陸相發言，東條首相即登壇報告陸軍關係戰況，嗣由島田海相說明海軍關係戰況後，至十一時四十四分暫時休息。二時三分重開，由松平議長報告呈遞勅語奉答文經過，並蒙再賜勅語，至此全體起立，由松平議長捧讀勅語，旋提出臨時動議：即提出對陸海軍之感謝決議案，由德川家正公代表發言，說明提案理由，朗讀案文一教表決通過。嗣由東條兼陸相，島田海相，分別代表陸海軍致謝辭，於此本年內議事即告完畢，松平議長並說明議會為等待政府準備提出議案等之規定，至明年一月廿日止為休會期間，如遇必要時，常可隨時召開，並定由明年一月廿一日召開全體會議，於二時二十二分散會。</p>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　日衆院二十七日開全體會議，通過致謝陸海軍決議案，繼岡田議長提議，全體起立對陣亡將士作致謝之默禱後，由陸海兩相分別致謝辭，繼由議員代表向應召之二議員致祝辭，旋決議向就任議員二十五年之齋藤隆夫氏表彰案，繼由議員代表向已放議員致哀悼，於是本年議事完全議畢。</p>
<h3>日陸海兩相　報告戰況</h3>
<p>陸相報告</p>
<p>東京二十七日中央社　日東條陸相於第八十四屆議會席上，報告戰況，要旨如次：於茲謹對諸君報告前次議會以來之陸軍戰況，第一，</p>
<p>西南太平洋方面，我陸海軍部隊自十月以來，即邀擊敵之正式反攻，到處重創敵眾，我陸軍刻仍於所羅門羣烏，俾斯麥羣島及束部新幾內亞三方面與敵激戰中。所羅門羣島方面，敵軍首於十月廿七日以一部隊在××島登陸，繼之十一月一日，復以有力部隊於艦艇及飛機之掩護下，在波根維爾島西岸特羅基納附近開始登陸，該方而我陸軍部隊即對之迎擊，並於海軍協力下，以艦艇使一部隊於敵背後登陸，實行攻擊，於局部地區，予敵以殲減打擊，然敵逐次增加兵力，刻仍繼續戰『中。俾斯麥羣島，新不列顚島方面敵軍於十二月十五日以艦船約二十艘及舟艇多艘，在俾斯麥東北地區登陸，我陸上部隊當即加以反擊，並於陸海軍航空部隊協力下，對之加以攻擊，刻仍激戰中。迄現在止，判明該方之戰果，計我陸軍部隊擊沉擊毀敵艦船六艘，舟艇百餘艘，擊落敵機至少約二十架。又敵自十月下句以來，會屢以戰鬥轟炸機聯合編隊，攻擊拉巴爾方面，該方面我陸軍部隊與海軍協力担任防空戰鬥，我陸軍部隊自十月下旬以來，擊落敵機約百五十架。束部新幾內亞方面，如前次所報吿，敵軍係於九月下旬在芬希哈罕登陸者，我軍當即對之攻擊，於十月中句之末，突破敵陣地，將其切斷，更使一部隊於敵背後登陸，斃敵約三千名，擊毀或鹵護敵火砲約二十餘門，然其後敵軍積極增強兵力，其一部於我側面實行登陸，今幾全演成補給戰狀態。我軍自十月下旬以來，擎況敵魚雷艇約二十艘，該方面我航空部隊或長驅攻擎敵空軍基地，或於附近地區協力陸上部隊作戰，更畫夜努力護衛我海上運輸，防禦敵機及潛艇之侵襲，自十月下句以來，所獲戰果，計擊落，擊毀敵機約三百五十架，我方約損失三十架。第二，</p>
<p>澳洲西北方面，敵軍除積極妨害我作戰準備外，並努力準備反攻，我陸軍航空部隊則隨時從事空戰，並護衛船團警戒敵潛艇。又該方面我陸上部隊刻正積極加強作戰準備中。第三，</p>
<p>緬甸方面　自今春以來，敵方宣告反攻緬甸，九月以後，我軍鑒於敵軍企圖蠢動，故乃制先開始行動，予以打擊。蓋緬甸東北怒江正面，我軍十月中旬以來已進至怒江西岸，予敵軍約兩師以殲滅打擊，此次作戰主因，渝方喪失滇緬公路後，百思無策，因之企圖協同英軍奪回緬甸北部，對此我軍則制其先機，將其此次企圖予以擎碎。我軍於此次作戰所獲得之戰果，除擊斃及俘虜渝軍約一五零零外，並鹵獲火砲槍枝甚夥。又來襲緬甸方面之敵機，雨季過後遽然增多，企圖擾亂我後方要地，對此我陸軍航空部隊則始終以強烈之門志勇戰奮鬥，向完成其任務過進，我機於中印空咯方面活躍尤力，予敵之打擊甚大。又十二月三日與海軍航空部隊相協力，大艦進攻加爾各答，乘敵之虛，痛炸其港灣設施及船舶，收獲戰果甚大，自十月下旬以後所收獲之戰果，計擊落及擊毀敵機約一百五中架，擊沉及擊毀敵船十餘艘及舟艇多艘。第四，</p>
<p>中國方面　仍不斷討伐以擴大治安地區，今秋更有華北及常德等作戰，自一月下旬以來，於中國各地作戰約四千次，渝軍交戰兵力約六十餘萬名，如上所述，渝方因企岡恢復其滲緬公路之生命綫，故我中國派造軍為予以牽制及擊潰武漢正面之渝軍，乃於十月上句開始向常德進攻，一路包圍殲滅各地之有力渝軍，終於十二月上旬將常德佔領，而完全達成作戰目的。此間渝軍會調遺計劃開往緬甸方面之兵力，由各方展開反攻與常德之守軍及空軍相協力頑強抵抗，兩軍之激戰，實近所罕有，此次交戰之渝軍約三十餘師團，達四十萬人，我軍所瘦之戰果，計渝軍棄屍及被俘約四萬四千，鹵獲其火砲百五十門，槍枝約七千，渝軍師長六名於是役陣亡。又今秋以來，駐渝美空軍已見增強，其出擊機數每月總計約五百架，我陸軍航空部隊則隨時從事空戰，當德作戰更會予以重大打擊。十月下旬以來之戰果，計擊落擊毀敵機約百二十架，我機損失二十架，陸軍方面鑒於中國方面之空戰意羲軍大，今後當更隨時殲減敵空軍，以防其蠢動，而期本土防空之萬全。第五，</p>
<p>滿洲及本土　北方，我陸軍部隊冒酷寒防衛其防綫固若金湯，又防衛本土之部隊除強化防備外，並積極實行訓練，以期未來防一備之完　，要之，陸軍之戰況，自十月下句以來，無何重大變化，然各方面之戰局已愈深刻激烈，敵方更企圖破壞我方之交通，於茲須特別注意者，即增援戰之重要，其重點即資材之生產及運輸二點。關於前者，幸賴國民諸君之熱烈協力，如飛機等增產之成果，最近頗為可觀，此實堪同慶者，此後更望進一步努力，關於運輸方面，則亦因與海軍之密切協力，強化對策，以及後方國民之努力，亦可期其毫無遺憾。最近敵方其於其謀略宣傳，曾屢弄威嚇言辭敵方陷於今日之焦燥而急圖反攻之狀態，實不可言喻，我可以擊減敵軍之良機，故敵方此種態度對我方反而有利，期全體軍民堅定必勝信念，發揮強烈之攻擊精神，以不屈不撓之決意，澈底邁進戰爭。</p>
<p>海相報告</p>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電日烏田海相二十七日於議會席上，說明日海軍戰況，要旨如次：於茲謹對諸君說明本年度十月以來，我海軍戰況之概要，我軍於大東亞戰爭之緒戰中，佔領大東亞及太平洋，印度洋之廣大地域，逐次加強戰略態勢，同時</p>
<p>急速開發富源，茲說明本期間內之主要作戰如次：首觀印度洋方面，我海軍部隊初與陸軍緊密協力，鞏固佔領地域之防備，更進而攻擊敵之後方，十二月三日，我陸海軍航空部隊，曾於盡間轟炸加爾各答，重創敵軍事設施及商船。又北太平洋方面，我海軍　隊亦與陸軍部隊協力，於酷寒中堅守陸海空三面，刻正作攻擊整備，澳洲方面，我海軍航空部隊會於十一月十二日未明，大舉空襲敵軍據點達爾文。布維克斯克里格及巴捷拉等地，予以莫大損害。又東新幾內亞方面，我海軍陸戰隊及航空部隊，亦於芬希哈罕附近一帶克服困苦與缺乏，協力陸軍部隊，努力擊潰敵軍。次就南太平洋方面觀之，兩月來，亦屢次展開大規模激烈之海空戰，我海空部隊已獲偉大戰果，第一，即所羅門羣島波根維爾烏方面之作戰，最初為十月二十七日，敵一部隊於所羅門羣烏之摩諾烏登陸，迄二月三日止，僅量肅清敵軍，乃運續展開所謂波根維爾島海展及第一次至第六次之波根維爾島海面空戰。由此可知敵軍乃企岡在所羅門羣島衝擊拉巴爾方面，乃擬首先占領盧諾烏及波根維爾島，故以有力之運輪船團及航空母艦，戰艦等機動部隊執拗進攻。反之，我海軍航空部隊及海上部隊，則隨時予以迎擊，冒惡劣天氣，反覆實行勇敢攻擊，已獲偉大戰果。計擊沉擊毀敵航空母艦十一艘，戰艦入艘，巡洋艦二十八艘及其他艦艇多艘，並擊落敵機約六百架。敵軍更對新不列顚實行攻擊，十二月十五日，其一部隊曾企圖在該島之馬加斯角登陸，我海軍航空部隊即對之加以攻擊，於敵軍登陸前擊潰其大部，然一部敵軍終於登陸成功，刻正與我守備隊激戰中。邇來我海軍航空部隊運日轟炸敵運輪船團，敵艦船已蒙受重大損害，自不待言，即其兵員及軍需品等亦蒙鉅大損害，迄二十七日止，已擊沉擊毀敵巡洋艦三艘，遝輸船二十二艘及其他登陸用舟艇等約百艘。再就</p>
<p>潛艇方面作戰　言之，日潛艇部隊以堅忍持久之精神，在廣大之海域中，從事邀擊敵軍艦隊與切斷敵軍補給綫等作戰，除在吉爾貝特羣島方面擊沉敵航空母艦一艘外，計於全海域共擊沉敵船十二艘約十萬噸。此外，我艦隊及航空部喙，在大東亞各海城從事防衛各要區及擔任護送船舶任務。（以下轉入第二版）</p>

<h3>新愛爾蘭島附近日機猛炸敵艦隊　南太平洋戰局進入新階段</h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　日大本營二十七日下午四時發表：　十二月一十五日晨有敵機部隊之艦戰機約一百二架，來襲新愛爾蘭島加比恩格，日守軍當即遂擊，擊落其三架，日方受損極輕。　日海軍機隊於二十五日傍晚，在波根維爾島北方海面轟炸上述敵機動部隊，炸沉敵艦一艘，（艦型未明）日軍損失有飛機四架未返原防。　日海軍機隊於二十五日上午邀擊來襲垃巴爾之敵機約七十架，擊落其二十架，（內二架尚未正式）日軍損失有飛機三架未返原防。　日海軍機隊於二十六日晨轟炸馬加斯角附近艦隊及比萊羅島敵陣地，獲舉戰果如次：擊沉敵駁船一艘，擊毀型特殊輸送船二艘（諒沉沒）·小型特殊輸送船一艘（焚燒東創）·登陸用舟艇一艘（焚燒重創）·驅潛艇一艘（熒燒重創），炸毀熒燒敵陣地二處，比莢羅烏遭受連續轟炸，概成暗日。</p>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　敵軍在南太平洋之攻勢愈趨猛烈，茲又突於二十五日晨以機動部隊向新愛爾蘭島方面出擊，進攻加比恩格，於是太平洋戰局由所羅門羣島方面擴大至俾斯麥羣島進入新的階段，今敵軍刻正集中其空軍力量，進攻俾斯麥羣島中之拉巴爾及加比恩格，因拉巴爾為新不列顚烏之戰略要點，加比恩格則為新愛爾蘭島之要塞，故預料敵軍之攻擎將較過去更為熾烈，然該方面之日軍係處內綫地位，並已在強力之制空權下邀擊敵軍，預料敵軍必將遭受東創。</p>
<h3>日機連日轟炸下比萊羅島成焦土</h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　日海軍機隊會於二十五日傍晚，在波根維爾烏北方海面轟炸敵機動部隊，炸沉敵艦才一艘，並於是日在拉巴爾上空邀擊來襲敵機七十架，擊落其二十架，復於二十六日在馬加斯角方面轟炸敵艦船，收獲莫大戰果，比萊羅島之敵軍陣地已被夷為火燼</p>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　據南太平洋日軍某地基電美（B24）型機十五架，會於二十四日來滬內南太平洋日屬凱塞林島，被日軍擊落其一架，日方無損失。</p>

<h3>日陸海兩相　報告戰況　（續第一扳）</h3>
<p>自十月迄今己擊沉敵潛艇達十一艘，今後更將強化各種對策，封鎖敵軍之蠢動，茲將前次報告後迄今兩個月內，我海軍部隊所獲之綜合戰果如次：擊沉敵軍主要艦船計航空母艦十六艘，戰艦五艘，巡洋艦二十六艘，驅逐艦九艘，潛艇十一艘，運輸船三十三艘，擊毀敵航空母艦入艘，戰艦四艘，巡洋艦二十五艘，逐艦八艘，運輸船十五聲，我方之損害備巡洋艦二艘受微傷，　遂艦二艘沉沒，再就飛機言之，計擊落敵機約九百四十架，我方約損失二日架。蓋敵方因戰略及國內之混亂，極感焦慮，故不惜犧牲，迭連以重兵來犯，緣自敵軍來襲該兩島後，至十一月二十九日之間，會發生所謂第一次至第四次之吉爾貝特群島海面空襲，此即敵軍為補給掩護以上作戰，以運輸船團及航空母艦等機動部隊實行攻擊，而遭我軍連續痛擊之作戰。及十二月五日，以航空母艦為基幹之敵機動部隊，更強　馬紹爾羣烏方面，當經我航空部喙予以殲減打擎，敵所企圖全成泡影，此即馬紹爾羣島海面空戰·我等于吉爾貝特及馬紹爾羣島方面，除擊沉擊毀敵航空母艦十三艘，巡洋艦七艘，及多數艦艇外，並擊落敵機一百二十五架。其次馬紹爾方面之空襲，亦極頻繁，迭與我軍。</p>
<p>展開激烈空戰，大部隊敵機均被擊落，其主要者，如十二月二日，敵機約二百數十架來慶，被擊落二百零一架，又同月二十四日，敵機百三十五架來襲，被擊落五十八架，第二為吉爾貝特羣島及馬紹爾羣島方面之作戰，敵軍以航空母艦及戰艦為基幹之大部喙，會於十一月十九日攻擊吉爾員特羣島之護送船團，及達拉瓦島，我海軍陸戰隊即於海軍航空部隊掩護下，於敵軍登陸前，對之加以中痛擊，使護極大損書，繼轉為陸上戰鬥，我軍繼續暫戰，至最後，卒於十一月二十五日全軍玉碎，敵方對該兩島上我守備隊之奮戰”極為讀佩，且發表此次作戰已蒙開戰以來未有之大死傷。又因以上之作戰，我軍更獲得予敵以莫大打擊之機會，結果仍遭受以此重大之損書，美國內對此亦頗有責難，例如美當局曾竭力障蔽此重大損害，但此乃明顯之事實，絕不能完全隱蔽，且一般美人對其政府之發表，似皆不信賴，故由此可知美政府之威信必將掃地。再自開戰以來，陸海空所予美國人力之打學極大，僅死於我海軍之手者，即已約達十七萬，負傷者倍之，故可知所予美國民之打擊甚大，在此極短期間，我軍雖已獲得如此驚人戰果，但此尚非予敵以致命打擊，吾人需明確認識日趨緊迫之戰局？蓋近代戰中爭奪制海　必以空軍為主，與昔僅由彼我艦隊作一兩次決戰即可決定戰局者，大別其趣。蓋此乃所謂連續決戰之戰爭，故吾人當前要務，即克服一切困難，動員一億國民之智能。</p>
<p>努力增強戰力</p>
<p>俾大量供給前綫將士所需之飛機艦船使繼續奮戰，以達成聖戰目的，此絕非難事也。</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>戰時消費特稅</h3>
<p>我們以前說過，一國籌集戰　的正當辦法，不外於徵稅與發行公債兩途，而以增發紙幣為下策，而且是飮鳩止渴的役性自殺政策，即便發行戰時公價而消化成績欠佳，則其結果依然為紙幣的增發，所以說戰時財政的最良政策，英如　稅。繳稅之中，又以繳收　時消費特稅為最合理，最有效，因為在今日中國戰時經濟的畸形狀態下，徵收戰時消費特稅，至少具有兩個最重要的意義：其一，由於一般人貶視幣値的心理（例如耶誕前夕，無塲淸茶一杯，素價髙至一百二十元）所以大家越發濫用紙幣，徵收戰時消費特稅，就是要責成濫用紙幣者為國家收回紙幣：其二，戰時消費特稅的徵稅標準旣以娛樂類及奢侈品之稅率為最高，則在戰時節約消費方面，自可期待着十分有效的結果，至少可以因此滅少一些無謂的消費。</p>
<p>戰時消費特稅的徵稅標準，聞以奢侈物品如金銀手飾珠費鑽石古玩玉器，及娛樂特稅中之鄒票，妓院局　，跑馬票，香檳票，獎券等稅率為最高，旅館筵席特稅次之。至於比一切奢侈物品尤為無用而有害之鴉片，比一切娛樂尤為勞民傷財之賭塲，我們認為根本上就不是徴收消費特稅所可解决，而是應當以從根　除為執行之原則的；萬一不能除根而必須「寓禁於征的話，那末，也得要苛以無可再苛的消費特稅，方為合理。</p>
<h3>全國商聯會　將於明春成立　籌委會在起草章程中</h3>
<p>中央社　昨據泰晤士報訊，全國商會聯合會之組織，現經籌備委員會起草章程，呈請當局核准，幷積極籌備中，大約明年春初即可成立。在戰前本有全國商聯會之設，戰後其會務早已結束，現在各方均感覺有重行設立該會之必要，爰由上海南京蘇州蕪湖杭州等地商界領一袖，共同硏討，於不久前設立籌備委員會，積極從事籌備云。</p>

<h3>答復一讀者</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>今天我接到一對由申報一讀者寄來的信，全文如左：</p>
<p>「吉田東祐先生在申報社論欄內發表的文章，我十入都拜讀過了。先生可以說得是一位「中國通　通」，很多我們感覺到而未曾說出的苦悶，他一一　直地先於大家說出了。但是為什麽吉田東　先生的文章，總不在上海出版的日文報紙或雜誌上刋載呢？這一點　使人感到美中不足。照理先生的文章常常是論及中日兩方面的事，單使中國人了解，　是未够。我認為應使在滬甚至在東亞裏的日本人都能讀到先生的理論，這不是事半功儕的事嗎？先生又何樂而不為？抑或個中另有如果先生以我的信不是開玩笑的話，希望能够公開答覆，幸甚　一個讀者問十二月二十六日在上海」</p>
<p>我所以不在本地的日文報紙·雜誌上發表我的文章，並不是像這位讀者所想像的那樣有特別的用意，在本地的某日本報紙上也曾有三次登載過我初期所寫的文章。後也曾兩次將我的文章寄到那個報館去，可是，不知是什麽原因。都沒有登載出來。從此以後，我再也不寄我的文章到那個報館去了。</p>
<p>還有一個經騐，我曾受一個日本人經營的雜誌社的委託，呌我寫文章，我就寫了一篇文章寄去了，但據說是文章的內容不好，又退回來了。</p>
<p>我自己知道，我寫的東西和本地的日本人的感情並不完全相符合。同時，我最近知道和我的思想相同的日本人也遂漸增加起來了。所以我並不急於用日本文發表。</p>
<p>然而，申報社長陳彬　氏，總希望使多數的日本人閱讀我的論文集，所以最近計畫要發行日文的飾文集，贈送與日本的關心於中日問題的人們閱讀·在明年年初將以中日問題硏究所編輯申報社發行，「為中日問題之全面的解决」的日文吉田東祐言論集出版。老實說，我也以為使多數的日本人讀我的論文集，較中國的讀者是更有意義的。</p>
<p>借申報寶貴的篇幅謹作一言以答讀者。</p>

        <h1>1943.12.28</h1>
<h3>Wartime and Peacetime</h3>
<p>Wartime and peacetime seem to be opposing terms, not to be mentioned in the same breath. However, both are alternating periods in the survival history of any nation. Therefore, although their forms are different, they have common essential elements and interlocking relationships. If one fails to grasp the true meaning of this, the nation may be at a loss in either period, with no basis for advance or retreat, and tend toward destruction through turmoil.</p>
<p>The characteristic of wartime is tension and hardship, while the characteristic of peacetime is ease and prosperity. This is the superficial difference between the two. However, whether in wartime or peacetime, the thoughts and actions of each individual should be premised on the survival of the entire nation, so that its future is secure and bright. Therefore, beneath their superficial differences, there are inherent common elements. Thus, when we are in peacetime, we should take advantage of the easy and prosperous environment, and with outstanding diligence, seek full recuperation to cultivate the strength to cope with sudden changes. As for being in wartime, we should adapt to the mood of tension and hardship, and with a calm and serious attitude, strive for final glorious victory, to preserve the vitality for restoration and construction. Therefore, peacetime cannot forget wartime, lest ease and prosperity lead to decadence and chaos, and wartime cannot forget peacetime, lest tension and hardship gradually lead to resentment and turmoil. The consequences of decadence, chaos, resentment and turmoil are all sufficient to destroy the life of an entire nation. Therefore, I say: Treat "peace" as "war," and treat "war" as "peace." This is the golden rule for national survival, and it is also sufficient to deeply understand the importance of the interlocking relationship between the two.</p>
<p>In the past century, our country's history has already gone through several alternations of wartime and peacetime. However, in each alternation, it failed to seize the opportunity to do well for itself. Therefore, each time after a wartime period, many humiliations are added, and each time after a peacetime period, much strength is destroyed. Corruption breeds insects, which leads to external instigation, alienation, bribery, inducement, and threats, and the loss of the ability to survive independently. Is the phenomenon of accumulated weakness accidental?</p>
<p>The past is gone, but the future can be pursued. Since the Sino-Japanese Incident six years ago, although there was a period of peace due to the return of the National Government to its capital, it entered a greater and more important state of war by participating in the Greater East Asia War. Today, it has gradually reached a decisive period, that is, gradually reaching the peak of the war. Examining the recent situation in Shanghai alone, there is enough to make people suddenly awaken. In the education sector, the authorities in charge of education, the teachers engaged in education, and the male and female students receiving education are all apathetic and sluggish, without any manifestation of tension or hardship. In the economic sector, the cry for control becomes louder and louder, the rise in prices becomes more and more frantic, and the black market becomes more and more rampant. The purpose of control is to evenly distribute and conserve materials, but the result is monopoly, hoarding, speculation, and waste. This results in a sharp decline in production and increasing poverty. In addition, everything else, whether in life or service, lacks a calm and serious expression. All measures seem to be aimed at eliminating the strength of the rear and destroying the vitality of the people, seeking complete destruction to please the enemy. Since December 8th two years ago, British and American forces have been swept away from the entire East Asia. These facts of corruption and decadence can no longer be attributed to external causes.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Greater East Asia Alliance is a concrete fact of coexistence and co-prosperity for the Greater East Asia Group. To seek the soundness of the group, one must seek the soundness of each individual member. If the society of Shanghai alone does not understand the characteristics of wartime, and has no perseverance to treat "war" as "peace," but uses the means of the strong bullying the weak and the mentality of fishing in troubled waters, recognizing the resentment and turmoil of wartime as normal, then the situation in other places is even more unimaginable. Most of the rear areas of the Greater East Asia War will inevitably suffer its adverse effects. From the standpoint of China, it should quickly realize the current state of war and how to behave in peacetime thereafter, and further understand the interlocking nature of wartime and peacetime, striving to invigorate itself and eliminate all incomprehensible and unreasonable malformed ugly states, and exert the strength that a member of East Asia should contribute. Otherwise, it will not only harm itself, but also burden the allied countries and the entire Greater East Asia!</p>

<h3>Japanese Army and Navy Ministers Report on War Situation</h3>
<p>Army Minister's Report</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Army Minister Tojo reported on the war situation at the 84th session of the Diet, the gist of which is as follows: I would like to report to you on the war situation of the Army since the previous Diet session. First,</p>
<p>In the Southwest Pacific, since October, our Army and Navy units have been intercepting the enemy's formal counter-offensive and inflicting heavy damage on the enemy everywhere. Our Army is currently engaged in fierce battles with the enemy on three fronts: the Solomon Islands, the Bismarck Archipelago, and eastern New Guinea. In the Solomon Islands, the enemy first landed a unit on ×× Island on October 27th. Subsequently, on November 1st, they began landing near Torokina on the west coast of Bougainville Island with strong units under the cover of warships and aircraft. Our Army units on that side immediately counterattacked, and with the cooperation of the Navy, landed a unit behind the enemy to carry out an attack. In local areas, they inflicted annihilation blows on the enemy. However, the enemy gradually increased their forces, and the battle is still continuing. In the Bismarck Archipelago and New Britain, on December 15th, the enemy landed in the northeast region of Bismarck with about 20 warships and many boats. Our land units immediately counterattacked and, with the cooperation of the Army and Navy air forces, attacked them. The battle is still fierce. As of now, the confirmed results of the battle on that side are that our Army units sank or destroyed six enemy warships and more than one hundred boats, and shot down at least about 20 enemy aircraft. Also, since the lower ten days of October, the enemy has repeatedly attacked Rabaul with joint formations of fighter-bombers. Our Army units on that side are cooperating with the Navy to undertake air defense battles. Since the lower ten days of October, our Army units have shot down about 150 enemy aircraft. In eastern New Guinea, as reported last time, the enemy landed at Finschhafen in the lower ten days of September. Our army immediately attacked them, broke through the enemy's defenses at the end of the middle ten days of October, cut them off, and landed a unit behind the enemy, killing about 3,000 enemies and destroying or seizing about 20 enemy artillery pieces. However, after that, the enemy actively strengthened their forces, and a part of them landed on our flank, and now it has almost completely become a supply battle. Since the lower ten days of October, our army has sunk about 20 enemy torpedo boats. Our air force on that side has either launched long-range attacks on enemy air bases, or cooperated with land units in battles in nearby areas, and has worked hard day and night to protect our maritime transport and defend against enemy aircraft and submarine invasions. Since the lower ten days of October, the results achieved have been about 350 enemy aircraft shot down or destroyed. Our side lost about 30 aircraft. Second,</p>
<p>In northwestern Australia, in addition to actively hindering our war preparations, the enemy is also working to prepare for a counter-offensive. Our Army Air Force is conducting air combat at any time and guarding convoys, as well as being vigilant against enemy submarines. Also, our land units on that side are currently actively strengthening their war preparations. Third,</p>
<p>In Burma, since this spring, the enemy has declared a counter-offensive in Burma. After September, our army, in view of the enemy's attempts to stir up trouble, took the initiative to launch an operation and strike them. In the northeast of Burma on the Nu River front, since the middle ten days of October, our army has advanced to the west bank of the Nu River and inflicted an annihilation blow on about two enemy divisions. The main reason for this operation is that after the Chongqing side lost the Yunnan-Burma Road, they were at a loss and attempted to cooperate with the British army to recapture northern Burma. Our army preempted them and crushed their attempt. The results of the operation achieved by our army include the killing and capture of about 1,500 Chongqing soldiers, and the seizure of many artillery pieces and rifles. Also, the number of enemy aircraft attacking the Burmese front has suddenly increased after the rainy season, attempting to disrupt our rear key areas. In response, our Army Air Force has always fought bravely with a strong will to complete its mission. Our aircraft are particularly active in the China-India airspace, and the damage to the enemy is very great. Also, on December 3rd, in cooperation with the Naval Air Force, a large fleet attacked Calcutta, taking advantage of the enemy's weakness and bombing its port facilities and ships, achieving great results. Since the lower ten days of October, the results achieved have been about 150 enemy aircraft shot down or destroyed, and more than ten enemy ships and many boats sunk or destroyed. Fourth,</p>
<p>In China, we are still constantly conducting punitive expeditions to expand the security areas. This autumn, there were also operations in North China and Changde. Since the lower ten days of January, there have been about 4,000 operations in various parts of China, with Chongqing troops engaging about 600,000 men. As mentioned above, because the Chongqing side attempted to restore the lifeline of its Yunnan-Burma Road, our China-based forces attacked Changde in the upper ten days of October in order to contain and defeat the Chongqing troops on the Wuhan front. They encircled and annihilated strong Chongqing troops in various places along the way, and finally occupied Changde in the upper ten days of December, completely achieving the operational objective. During this period, the Chongqing troops mobilized forces that had been planned to be sent to Burma, launched counter-offensives from all directions, and stubbornly resisted in cooperation with the garrison and air force in Changde. The fierce fighting between the two armies was rarely seen in recent times. The Chongqing troops engaged in this battle numbered about thirty divisions, reaching 400,000 men. The results achieved by our army were about 44,000 Chongqing soldiers abandoned their bodies and were captured, and 150 artillery pieces and about 7,000 rifles were seized. Six Chongqing divisional commanders were killed in this battle. Also, since this autumn, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing has been strengthened, and the total number of sorties per month is about 500. Our Army Air Force is conducting air combat at any time, and the De operation inflicted heavy damage. Since the lower ten days of October, the results achieved have been about 120 enemy aircraft shot down or destroyed. We lost 20 aircraft. The Army believes that the significance of air combat on the China front is great, and in the future, it will constantly eliminate enemy air forces to prevent their trouble and ensure the safety of the mainland air defense. Fifth,</p>
<p>In Manchuria and the Mainland, in the north, our Army units brave the severe cold to defend their lines, which are as solid as a rock. In addition to strengthening defenses, the units defending the mainland are also actively implementing training in order to complete future defense preparations. In short, the war situation of the Army has not changed significantly since the lower ten days of October, but the war situation on all fronts has become more profound and fierce. The enemy is also attempting to disrupt our transportation. What must be paid special attention to here is the importance of reinforcement warfare, and the focus is on the production and transportation of materials. Regarding the former, thanks to the enthusiastic cooperation of the people, the results of increased production of aircraft and other items have been quite impressive recently, which is really commendable. We hope to make further efforts in the future. Regarding transportation, with the close cooperation of the Navy, strengthening countermeasures, and the efforts of the people in the rear, we can also expect that there will be no regrets. Recently, the enemy has repeatedly used threatening words in its strategic propaganda. The enemy is in a state of anxiety today and is eager to counter-attack, which is indescribable. We can seize the opportunity to reduce the enemy's troops, so the enemy's attitude is beneficial to us. We hope that all the military and civilians will firmly believe in victory, give play to a strong spirit of attack, and move forward thoroughly in the war with an unyielding determination.</p>
<p>Navy Minister's Report</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Navy Minister Shimada explained the war situation of the Navy at the Diet session on the 27th, the gist of which is as follows: I would like to explain to you the outline of the war situation of our Navy since October of this year. In the early stages of the Greater East Asia War, our army occupied a vast area of Greater East Asia, the Pacific Ocean, and the Indian Ocean, gradually strengthening the strategic posture, and at the same time</p>
<p>Rapidly developing resources. The main operations within this period are explained as follows: First, in the Indian Ocean, our naval units initially closely cooperated with the army to consolidate the defense of the occupied area, and further attacked the enemy's rear. On December 3, our army and navy air forces bombed Calcutta at night, heavily damaging enemy military facilities and merchant ships. Also, in the North Pacific, our naval teams cooperated with army units, guarding the land, sea and air in the severe cold, and are currently making attack preparations. In Australia, our naval air force carried out a large-scale air raid on the enemy's stronghold, Darwin, on the 12th of November, before dawn, as well as to places such as Broome and Port Hedland, inflicting enormous damage. Also, in eastern New Guinea, our naval marines and air force cooperated with army units near Finschhafen, overcoming difficulties and shortages, and worked hard to defeat the enemy. Next, looking at the South Pacific, large-scale and fierce naval and air battles have also been launched many times in the past two months. Our naval and air forces have achieved great results. First, the operation in the Bougainville Island area of the Solomon Islands. Initially, on October 27, an enemy unit landed on Mono Island in the Solomon Islands, and continued to sweep away the enemy troops until February 3, and continued to launch the so-called Bougainville Island Sea Exhibition and the first to sixth Bougainville Island surface air battles. From this, it can be seen that the enemy is trying to impact the Rabaul area in the Solomon Islands, and intends to occupy Luno Island and Bougainville Island first, so they launched a tenacious attack with a strong transport fleet and mobile units such as aircraft carriers and battleships. On the contrary, our naval air force and naval units intercepted them at any time, repeatedly carrying out brave attacks in adverse weather conditions, and have achieved great results. A total of 11 enemy aircraft carriers, 8 battleships, 28 cruisers and many other ships have been sunk or destroyed, and about 600 enemy aircraft have been shot down. The enemy also carried out an attack on New Britain. On December 15, a part of them attempted to land at Magagas corner of the island. Our naval air force attacked them and defeated most of them before the enemy landed. However, some of the enemy finally landed successfully and are currently engaged in fierce battles with our garrison. Recently, our naval air force has been bombing enemy transport fleets every day, and enemy ships have suffered heavy damage, not to mention that their soldiers and military supplies have also suffered huge damage. As of the 27th, 3 enemy cruisers, 22 transport ships and about 100 other landing craft have been sunk and destroyed. Then in</p>
<p>Submarine warfare, the Japanese submarine units, with the spirit of perseverance and persistence, are engaged in operations such as intercepting enemy fleets and cutting off enemy supply lines in the vast sea area. In addition to sinking one enemy aircraft carrier in the Gilbert Islands area, a total of 12 enemy ships totaling about 100,000 tons have been sunk in the entire sea area. In addition, our fleet and air force have been engaged in defending various key areas and escorting ships in various sea cities of Greater East Asia. (Continued on page 2)</p>

<h3>Japanese Aircraft Bombarded Enemy Fleet Near New Ireland Island: South Pacific War Enters New Stage</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 27th: On the morning of December 15th, an enemy unit of about 120 carrier-based fighters attacked Kavieng, New Ireland Island. The Japanese garrison immediately intercepted them, shooting down three of them. The Japanese side suffered very light damage. On the evening of the 25th, a Japanese naval air squadron bombed the above-mentioned enemy mobile unit on the sea north of Bougainville Island, sinking one enemy warship (type unknown). The Japanese military lost four aircraft that did not return to their bases. On the morning of the 25th, a Japanese naval air squadron intercepted about 70 enemy aircraft attacking Rabaul, shooting down 20 of them (including two not yet officially confirmed). The Japanese military lost three aircraft that did not return to their bases. On the morning of the 26th, a Japanese naval air squadron bombed the fleet near Magagas Point and enemy positions on Pilelo Island, achieving the following results: one enemy barge sunk, two special transport ships destroyed (presumed sunk), one small special transport ship destroyed (burned severely), one landing craft destroyed (burned severely), one anti-submarine boat destroyed (burned severely), two enemy positions destroyed and burned. Pilelo Island was subjected to continuous bombing and became scorched earth.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - The enemy's offensive in the South Pacific is becoming more and more fierce. It suddenly launched an attack on Kavieng in the New Ireland Island area with a mobile unit on the morning of the 25th. Thus, the Pacific war has expanded from the Solomon Islands to the Bismarck Archipelago, entering a new stage. The enemy is currently concentrating its air force to attack Rabaul and Kavieng in the Bismarck Archipelago. Since Rabaul is a strategic point in New Britain, and Kavieng is a fortress in New Ireland, it is expected that the enemy's attack will be more intense than in the past. However, the Japanese military on that side is in an inner-line position and is intercepting the enemy under strong air control. It is expected that the enemy will suffer severe damage.</p>
<h3>Pilelo Island Turns to Scorched Earth Due to Continuous Bombing by Japanese Aircraft</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese naval air squadron bombed an enemy mobile unit on the sea north of Bougainville Island on the evening of the 25th, sinking one enemy warship.

<h3>Economic Committee Member Yin Rugeng Talks to Reporters: North China Coal Mines Expected to Increase Production</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Yin Rugeng, a member of the National Economic Committee, came to Nanjing from Beiping a few days ago. Yesterday, reporters specially visited Mr. Yin to inquire about the current situation of increased coal production in North China, his views on the exchange of materials between the North and the South, and the details of Mr. Yin's planned Grand Canal. He answered each question separately. The answers are recorded as follows: (Question) What are your views on the exchange of materials between the North and the South? (Answer) If we want to ensure the smooth operation of the exchange of materials between the North and the South in the future, we must strive to increase the volume of transportation. There are no more than three ways to increase the volume of transportation: 1. Increase the number of railway freight cars. 2. Open up highways to supplement transportation with trucks. 3. Utilize waterways and implement sailboat transportation. The selection and transportation of exchanged goods should be studied in detail. This point can be discussed and handled by the Southern Commerce and Trade Control Association and the North China Trade Control Association. (Question) I heard that you have a plan to open up the Grand Canal. What are the specific methods? (Answer) The problem of opening up the Grand Canal has not been implemented to this day due to various difficulties. I plan to submit it for discussion at the next meeting of the National Economic Committee. After it is resolved and passed, it can be gradually promoted step by step, so that another blood vessel can be added to the north-south transportation. (Question) Please briefly tell us about the situation of increased coal production in North China. (Answer) The original Baojin and other coal mining companies in Shanxi have been merged into the Shanxi Coal Company. Its output is more than one million to two million tons per year. It is expected to increase to four million tons next year. If we actively increase production in order to adapt to the needs of the wartime system, it is expected that North China's coal production can be increased next year, and the fuel problem can also be solved accordingly.</p>

<h3>Major German-British Sea Battle in the Arctic Ocean - German Battleship Scharnhorst Sinks</h3>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) - The German 26,000-ton battleship "Scharnhorst" sank in the Arctic Ocean on Sunday. The news was officially announced today, stating that on the 26th of this month, a German fleet attacked a convoy sailing to the Soviet Union in the Arctic Ocean. After a prolonged battle with the British escort fleet, which was at a great disadvantage, the ship ran out of ammunition and was gloriously sacrificed, but the British fleet and the merchant ships it was escorting suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency) - The British Admiralty announced last night that the British Home Fleet, under the command of Admiral Fraser, escorted a Soviet convoy and sunk the German battleship Scharnhorst off North Cape in the Arctic Ocean. The ship was launched in 1936, with a displacement of 26,000 tons and a crew of 1,461. The ship was equipped with nine 11-inch guns, twelve 5.9-inch guns, and a large number of small guns, and carried four seaplanes. The ship was known for its mystery, having escaped from dangerous situations on several occasions, the most thrilling of which was the battle in February 1942 when it was trapped in the Brest fortress on the west coast of France. The British aircraft carrier "Glorious" was sunk by it in that battle. It was later reported that after the ship was repaired in the port of Kiel, it and the Lützow were assigned to attack British convoys.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army and Navy Report on War Situation (Continued from First Edition)</h3>
<p>Since October, we have sunk 11 enemy submarines. In the future, we will strengthen various countermeasures to block the enemy's movements. The comprehensive battle results obtained by our naval forces in the two months since the previous report are as follows: sunk enemy major warships: 16 aircraft carriers, 5 battleships, 26 cruisers, 9 destroyers, 11 submarines, 33 transport ships; destroyed enemy aircraft carriers: 8 aircraft carriers, 4 battleships, 25 cruisers, 8 destroyers, 15 transport ships. Our side suffered minor damage to two cruisers, and two destroyers sank. In terms of aircraft, we shot down approximately 940 enemy aircraft, and we lost approximately 200 aircraft. Because the enemy is extremely anxious due to strategic and domestic chaos, they have repeatedly launched attacks with heavy troops at the cost of sacrifice. From the time the enemy attacked these two islands until November 29, the so-called first to fourth air raids on the Gilbert Islands occurred. This was the enemy's operation to attack with transport convoys and mobile units such as aircraft carriers to supply and cover the above operations, and was continuously severely attacked by our army. On December 5, an enemy mobile unit based on aircraft carriers even launched a strong attack on the Marshall Islands. Our air force annihilated and repelled them, and the enemy's attempt was completely shattered. This was the air battle on the Marshall Islands. In the Gilbert and Marshall Islands, in addition to sinking and destroying 13 enemy aircraft carriers, 7 cruisers, and many ships, we also shot down 125 enemy aircraft. Secondly, the air raids on the Marshall Islands were also very frequent, and we engaged in fierce air battles with our army. Most of the enemy planes were shot down. The main ones were: On December 2, approximately 270 enemy planes came and 201 were shot down. On the 24th of the same month, 135 enemy planes attacked and 58 were shot down. The second was the battle in the Gilbert Islands and Marshall Islands. The enemy army, with aircraft carriers and battleships as the base, attacked the convoy of the Gilbert Islands and Tarawa Island on November 19. Our naval marines, under the cover of the naval air force, inflicted a heavy blow on the enemy before they landed, causing them to suffer great losses. They then turned to land battles, and our army continued to fight temporarily until the entire army was destroyed on November 25. The enemy highly praised the brave fighting of our garrison troops on the two islands and announced that the operation had suffered the greatest casualties since the start of the war. Also, because of the above operations, our army gained the opportunity to inflict a great blow on the enemy. As a result, they still suffered such heavy losses. There has been considerable criticism of this in the United States. For example, the US authorities have tried their best to conceal this significant damage, but this is an obvious fact that cannot be completely concealed. Moreover, the general American public does not seem to trust the government's announcements, so it can be seen that the credibility of the US government will be swept away. Furthermore, since the start of the war, the army, navy, and air force have inflicted great damage on US manpower. The number of those who died at the hands of our navy alone has reached approximately 170,000, and the number of those who were injured is twice that number. Therefore, it can be seen that the damage inflicted on the American people is very great. Although our army has achieved such amazing results in this extremely short period of time, this is not yet a fatal blow to the enemy. We need to clearly recognize the increasingly urgent war situation. In modern warfare, the struggle for control of the sea must be based on the air force. It is greatly different from the past, when the outcome of the war could be decided by just one or two decisive battles between the two fleets. This is the so-called continuous decisive battle war. Therefore, our current priority is to overcome all difficulties and mobilize the intelligence of 100 million people.</p>
<p>Strive to Increase Combat Power</p>
<p>So that a large number of aircraft and ships required by the front-line soldiers are supplied so that they can continue to fight bravely to achieve the purpose of the holy war. This is by no means difficult.</p>

<h3>Over Ten Thousand Young Students Petitioned and Marched Yesterday to Eliminate Vice in Shanghai</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) The Great East Asia War has been ongoing for over two years. Since our nation joined the war, the entire country, from top to bottom, has vigorously implemented the New Life Movement, economizing on consumption and increasing production to support the soldiers on the front lines who are fighting to defend East Asia, and to assist the Allied nations in striving for the liberation of East Asia. However, there are still a few individuals who are deluded and unrepentant, spending their days indulging in opium dens, gambling houses, and dance halls, disregarding the nation and the people's livelihoods, and being captivated by sensual pleasures. They waste resources, violate wartime restrictions, and willingly become traitors to the nation. Young people in the capital, driven by fervent patriotism, spontaneously gathered on the 17th of this month to launch a campaign to ban opium, gambling, and dance halls. Young students in Shanghai promptly responded and began to publicize and advise opium dens, gambling houses, and dance halls to quickly change their businesses. However, these opium dens, gambling houses, and dance halls were deeply entrenched and mostly remained hesitant and waited to see what would happen. Before Christmas, they even threw wild parties until dawn. Young students throughout the city, driven by righteous indignation, and in order to urge the municipal authorities to ban these establishments as soon as possible, spontaneously gathered over ten thousand people at nine o'clock yesterday morning (the 27th) to petition the municipal government. At noon, they went to various dance halls, opium dens, and gambling dens in the First District and the Nanshi area to give advice, engaging in an impressive march with intense emotion, which was applauded by the public.</p>
<p>Petitioning the Municipal Government and Marching in Formation</p>
<p>Yesterday, over ten thousand young students spontaneously gathered at the Zhaofeng Garden in West Shanghai and immediately sent three representatives to the Shanghai Special Municipal Government to petition, requesting that the government comply with public opinion and issue an order to ban opium, gambling, and dance halls, and eliminate the source of evil in Shanghai. After submitting the petition to the municipal government, they launched a large-scale march to awaken the unanimous support of the citizens. Thousands of young students throughout the city departed from the entrance of the municipal government, passed Yuyuan Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and entered the Eighth District along Weihaiwei Road, then proceeded along Taishan Road, Ding'an Road, and Ningxia Road, and rushed into the iron gate of Nanyang Bridge, all the way to the Seventh District, marching in formation and shouting slogans to ban opium, gambling, and dance halls, with intense emotion.</p>
<p>Gambling Dens and Opium Dens Were Thoroughly Cleared. The large group of young students then went to the Dasheng, Huamin, Tongqing, Yong'an, Lüfei, and Xiyuan gambling dens, shouting slogans to ban gambling as a demonstration, and sent personnel inside to explain the greater righteousness, ordering them to cease operations immediately. The young students all believed that the cash left behind in the gambling dens might be seized by gangsters, so they collected all of it, amounting to 200,210 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes, 28 yuan in military notes, 26.4 yuan in Central Reserve fractional notes, 22 yuan in old currency, 16 yuan in old currency fractional notes, and 28 yuan in damaged notes. The local police station immediately sent personnel to the scene to maintain order. Then, the students went to various opium dens and seized a large quantity of opium, heroin, and other drugs, along with gambling paraphernalia and illegally pawned stolen goods, loading them onto more than a dozen rickshaws and marching in formation to the Eighth District, continuing along Ningxia Road (Min Ti Ni Yin Road), Xizang Road, and entering the Da Hu Le and Lu Liang dance halls, advising them to change their businesses voluntarily. Then, they entered Nanjing Road, where all the dance halls had already voluntarily closed their doors. Finally, they turned into Jing'an Temple Road and gathered in the Racecourse Square.</p>
<p>Gambling Paraphernalia and Opium Paraphernalia Were Destroyed in Public.</p>
<p>By this time, it was 4:30 PM. Liu Yangshan, Deputy Director-General of the China Youth Corps, Pei Wen, Chief Secretary of the Shanghai Branch of the New Life Movement, and Su Cheng, Deputy Chief of the First Police Bureau, all arrived at the scene upon hearing the news and addressed all the young people, saying, "Your patriotic enthusiasm is deeply commendable, and I urge all young students to continue their efforts and hope that future actions must strictly adhere to discipline," and so on. After the speech, all the young people shouted patriotic slogans and destroyed the confiscated gambling paraphernalia, opium paraphernalia, and drugs on the spot. The illegally pawned stolen goods were handed over to the First Police Bureau for safekeeping. In addition, the students voluntarily requested the police officers to inspect them one by one to show impartiality. Finally, they shouted, "Ban opium, gambling, and dance halls! Long live Chinese youth! Long live the Republic of China!" and then dispersed. The gambling paraphernalia and opium paraphernalia confiscated from the gambling dens and opium dens were burned in public at the Racecourse at 4:30 PM that afternoon. As for the jewelry and other items, it was decided to present them to the government as a national defense donation, and the scrap copper and scrap iron were donated to the Iron and Steel Committee, while the quilts and other items were sent to charity organizations for disaster relief. The scrap iron, quilts, and other items were temporarily held in custody by the First Police Bureau.</p>
<p>Deputy Director Liu Delivers a Speech</p>
<p>Liu Yangshan, Deputy Director-General of the Youth Corps, especially gave a speech, saying, "Since the youth of this city responded to the anti-drug movement of the youth in the capital, I have been constantly concerned that young people are impetuous and easily swayed by emotions, which could lead to accidents. Therefore, every time I give a speech, I repeatedly admonish them to abide by discipline. This morning, at 9:00 AM, when I heard that the students had gathered to petition the municipal government, I immediately instructed the responsible comrades to convey to them to pay attention to discipline and social order. Unexpectedly, after the teams disbanded in Zhaofeng Park, they went their separate ways to advise the gambling dens and opium dens, and for a time, their emotions could not be restrained, and they acted somewhat aggressively, which is regrettable. Fortunately, with the painstaking persuasion of the police and security authorities, no accidents occurred. In the future, I hope that all the young students of the Qing Shou Association will deeply understand the daily training on discipline and never act on emotions."</p>
<p>Deputy Chief Su Delivers a Speech</p>
<p>Su Chengde, Deputy Chief of the First Police Bureau of the Shanghai Special Municipality, also gave a speech on this matter, saying, "Since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, our great rear area should invigorate the people's morale and fulfill the mission of national construction. Since the youth corps in the capital implemented the anti-opium, anti-gambling, and anti-dance hall movement, the youth of this city have responded enthusiastically, posting slogans and advising the people of the whole city, which is truly gratifying to me. Since the recovery of the concessions, this city is building a new Shanghai under the leadership of Mayor Chen, and the people's morale should also be boosted. However, what happened today was somewhat aggressive and inevitably conflicted with social order. Therefore, I hope that the young students will pay attention to publicity in the anti-drug movement in the future and take social order into consideration. This is my earnest hope."</p>

<h3>3-2, China Beats Italian All-Stars in International Cup Soccer Trial</h3>
<p>The International Cup soccer practice match between China and the Italian All-Stars team (which will be renamed the Macco Pablo team later) was held at 3:30 PM yesterday at the Yi Shi Stadium. The audience was crowded, with no less than ten thousand people. The stadium was packed, and the situation was unprecedentedly enthusiastic. The Italian All-Stars lineup was the same as reported. The Chinese team was Dai Linjing, Tan Xiang, and Li Yichen.</p>
<p>Three Did Not Arrive</p>
<p>The initial lineup was goalkeeper Liu Xuhan, left back Li Ning, right back Li Tiansheng, center back Tan Fuzhen, left midfielder Song Zhong Sheng, right midfielder Jia Yongfu, but Jia Yongfu's foot injury had not healed, and after playing for ten minutes, Zheng Yingbo rushed to replace A Fu. The center forward was Xu Wenkui, the left forward was Sun Jinshun, the right forward was Han Longhai, the left winger was Li Yao, and the right winger was Jia Youliang. The referee was Chen Jixiang. China scored first when center forward Xu Wenkui made a lob shot that went straight into the net. This goal was clear and beautiful, and the cheers from the audience shook the sky. At that time, the game had only started for three minutes, not even a minute. At twenty minutes, Youliang took a corner kick, and Mike T jumped up to catch it, but Bi Tou also jumped up to grab it at the same time, and collided with Mike, and the ball slipped into the net, making it 2-0. After the break,</p>
<p>The Two Teams Regrouped</p>
<p>The Italian All-Stars replaced Torsorini with Pagani. Because of the selection process, China changed goalkeepers to Zhang Banglun, right back to Zhuang Youren, and Han Longhai was moved inside to replace Zheng Yingbo, while Fei Chunhua took Han's place in the last game. The rest remained the same as before. After China made the changes, due to Zhuang Youren's weakness and Zhang Yulun's nervousness, the situation turned unfavorable. In less than three minutes, the Italian All-Stars advanced with five forwards, and Disena scored a goal in the chaos. A minute later, Lijie dribbled past Zhuang Youren and shot with his foot. The ball flew out like an arrow, but fortunately, Banglun had quick eyes and caught it with both hands. Then, Disena and Kabovi advanced side by side and entered the penalty area. Banglun came out to block, and Disena poked the ball past Banglun, and Kabovi easily scored, tying the game at 2-2. Twenty minutes later, China attacked but failed to score. Five minutes from the end of the game, Youliang got the ball and crossed it, and A Kui was waiting in the right position and scored from the edge. China narrowly defeated the Italian All-Stars 3-2 amid cheers from the crowd.</p>

<h3>Wartime Consumption Special Tax</h3>
<p>We have said before that the proper way for a country to raise war funds is through taxation and the issuance of public bonds, while the increase of paper money is the worst policy, a self-destructive policy of drinking poison to quench thirst. Even if wartime public bonds are issued but not well received, the result will still be the increase of paper money. Therefore, the best policy for wartime finance is taxation. Among taxes, the collection of wartime consumption special tax is the most reasonable and effective, because in today's distorted state of China's wartime economy, the collection of wartime consumption special tax has at least two most important meanings: First, due to the general psychology of depreciating currency value (for example, on the eve of Christmas, a cup of plain tea in a dance hall cost as much as 120 yuan), everyone is increasingly abusing paper money. The collection of wartime consumption special tax is to hold those who abuse paper money responsible for recovering paper money for the country. Second, since the tax rates for entertainment and luxury goods are the highest in the wartime consumption special tax, it is expected to have a very effective result in wartime consumption saving. At least it can reduce some unnecessary consumption.</p>
<p>It is heard that the tax rates for the wartime consumption special tax will be highest for luxury goods such as gold and silver jewelry, pearls, diamonds, antiques, and jade, as well as entertainment special taxes such as opera tickets, brothels, gambling halls, horse racing tickets, champagne tickets, and lottery tickets, followed by hotel banquet special taxes. As for opium, which is more useless and harmful than all luxury goods, and gambling halls, which are more wasteful and costly than all entertainment, we believe that they cannot be solved by collecting consumption special taxes at all, but should be eliminated from the root as a principle of execution. If it is impossible to eliminate the root and it is necessary to "imply prohibition in taxation," then it must be subjected to the most severe consumption special tax to be reasonable.</p>
<h3>National Federation of Commerce to Be Established Next Spring; Preparatory Committee Drafting Articles of Association</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) According to a report in the Times yesterday, the organization of the National Federation of Commerce is currently having its articles of association drafted by a preparatory committee, which has submitted them to the authorities for approval and is actively preparing for the establishment, which is expected to be completed in early spring next year. Before the war, there was a National Federation of Commerce, but its affairs ended long ago after the war. Now, all parties feel the need to re-establish the association, so business leaders from Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuhu, Hangzhou, and other places jointly discussed it and established a preparatory committee not long ago to actively engage in preparations.</p>
<p>Summary of Business Conditions</p>
<p>Public Bonds: Yesterday, the unofficial market for unified public bonds turned firm, with buyers appearing when prices fell.</p>
<p>Grain: Yesterday, the price of domestic rice fluctuated, because the road blockages were looser, and the price was too high, so the buying interest of food households in this city turned weak. The price of Dujian, Yinyuan, and Badao all fell slightly.</p>
<h3>With the End of the Year Approaching, a Decline in Chinese Stocks Is Inevitable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks fell sharply without recovering. With the end of the lunar year approaching, the stock exchange will close early, operating only until noon on the 29th, and will not reopen until January 5th. People are in a relaxed mood. The silver supply from banks has eased and has been released, but the position of money shops is still tight, and they are inevitably pressured by those who sell for cash. Investors took the opportunity to wait and see, and only started to be active in the afternoon, but it was difficult to reverse the fatigue. Trading became sparse. Yong'an Company in the department store industry once broke through the 200 yuan mark, but was finally supported by limit-price buyers. Xin Xin and other companies each fell by four or five yuan, and Guohuo fell by two yuan at least. In the textile industry, Yong'an Yarn Factory and Mei Ya each fell by one to ten yuan. The news that Guoguang Printing and Dyeing was expanding into a wool factory caused it to rise by nine yuan alone. Dagong also held firm, while the rest were flat. In the cultural industry, Zhonghua Film fell below 70 yuan, and Shanghai Commercial Press and Zhonghua Book Company each had sellers, and showed slight declines. In the pharmaceutical industry, Sino-French fell by another three yuan, Xin Ya fell below one yuan, and Da Zhonghua Match fell by ten yuan. In the public utilities industry, North Water and China Electric were both flat. The financial industry stocks were all flat, with few transactions. In the real estate industry, Lianhua alone showed its prowess, soaring by a huge 3.75 yuan, and closed at 36 yuan. Tianfeng's capital increase and Yongxing and others all saw increases. Da Zhonghua Enterprise alone held firm, while Jiu'an, Xin Ya Construction, and others were all flat. Kangyuan Can fell close to the 100 yuan mark, but recovered immediately. Most of the others fell slightly. The closing prices are listed below: Stock Name Closing Price</p>

<h3>Elementary Students' Enthusiasm for Holiday Donation to Help with Winter Clothing</h3>
<p>To repay the sincerity and care that our teachers have shown us this year, all the students prepared to take advantage of the upcoming New Year to discuss buying some gifts or New Year's cards to give to the teachers to express our respect. Unexpectedly, the teachers found out and gave us a big lesson, telling us to use this valuable money in more meaningful places, like those compatriots who are suffering from hunger and cold, who are worthy of our sympathy and assistance. We listened to the teachers' instructions and felt that this was more meaningful than giving New Year's cards to the teachers. Now we present 211 yuan to express our humble sympathy. Sincerely, All Students of the Private Lianyi Voluntary Elementary School.</p>

<h3>Answering a Reader</h3>
<p>— Yoshida Togo</p>
<p>Today I received a letter from a reader of Shen Bao, the full text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>"I have read all of Mr. Yoshida Togo's articles published in the editorial column of Shen Bao. It can be said that Mr. is a 'China expert'. He speaks out about many of the grievances that we feel but have not spoken out about. But why are Mr. Yoshida Togo's articles not published in Japanese newspapers or magazines published in Shanghai? This is what makes people feel disappointed. In theory, Mr.'s articles often discuss matters related to both China and Japan. It is not enough to only make the Chinese understand. I think it should make the Japanese in Shanghai and even in East Asia able to read Mr.'s theory. Isn't this a case of doing more with less? Why doesn't Mr. like it? Or is there something else? If Mr. thinks my letter is not a joke, I hope to be able to answer it publicly. Sincerely, A Reader, Shanghai, December 26th"</p>
<p>The reason why I don't publish my articles in local Japanese newspapers and magazines is not because I have a special purpose, as this reader imagines. My early articles have been published in a certain Japanese newspaper here three times. Later, I sent my articles to that newspaper twice, but for some reason, they were not published. From then on, I never sent my articles to that newspaper again.</p>
<p>There is also an experience. I was commissioned by a magazine run by a Japanese to write an article. I wrote an article and sent it, but it was said that the content of the article was not good, and it was returned.</p>
<p>I know myself that what I write does not fully conform to the feelings of the local Japanese. At the same time, I have recently learned that the number of Japanese who share my ideas is gradually increasing. So I'm not in a hurry to publish in Japanese.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Chen Binhe, the president of Shen Bao, always hopes to make the majority of Japanese people read my collection of essays. So recently, he plans to publish a collection of decorative articles in Japanese and give it to Japanese people who are concerned about Sino-Japanese issues to read. Early next year, the Sino-Japanese Problem Research Institute will edit and Shen Bao will publish "A Comprehensive Solution to the Sino-Japanese Problem," a collection of Yoshida Togo's speeches in Japanese. To be honest, I also think it is more meaningful to have the majority of Japanese read my collection of essays than to have Chinese readers read them.</p>
<p>I would like to take advantage of Shen Bao's valuable space to say a word in reply to the reader.</p>
