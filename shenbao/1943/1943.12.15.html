<p>社評</p>
<h3>從開羅到德黑蘭—國際問題答客問</h3>
<p>問：從美英渝的開羅會議到美蘇英的德黑蘭會議分別發表其宣言以後，頗引起一般人士的議論，這兩個會議，究竟有何意義？</p>
<p>答：從本質上看，這兩個會議，是完全一致的，不過從世界實際形勢看，却叉各不相同。所謂一致，是說在目前世界戰爭新階段，由於軸心國各方面的新發展，以及歐亞戰局之推移，使反軸心各國對於作戰方略以及彼此間政治問題，都有取得協調的必要，這是一致的要求。所謂不同，即是美蘇英渝間具有不同的企圖與地位，甚且相互間尙有許多不易解決的矛盾，重慶無法參加美蘇英會議，而蘇聯亦有不得不避免參加美英渝會議的苦衷。這裏最主要的一點，是日蘇關係之微妙的存在，和蘇渝之間的矛盾。誰都知道，斯太林是今日著名的現實主義者，他決不肯遷就正在鬧着渝共磨擦的重慶政權，他更不能不顧到違反日蘇中立條約的嚴重的後果。</p>
<p>問：然則，從開羅與德黑蘭會議之分別舉行一事，巳可看出反軸心國間最大的矛盾尙未消除了·但是，羅邱蔣會議的結果，巳經發表宜言，請問開羅會議的結果與趨向如何？</p>
<p>答：開　會議歷時五日，一共討論三個問題：一是軍事問題，二是戰爭目的問題，三是侵奪日本殖民地問題。然而　個會議又有羅　將會議與羅　伊（土耳其總統伊諾奴）會議之別。後者討論的中心在前者討論之中心在太平洋問題，完全爲英美防止渝將「動搖」而設法拉攏的一種手　。實際上渝蔣所得的還只是空頭支票，他不能不承認反軸心的世界戰略「繼續以對　爲第一」的事實。所以，渝蔣此行，帶回了些什麽。確是一大疑問。</p>
<p>問：那麼，開羅會議實際上不過美英兩國神經術的新發動而已，看不見　　意義。</p>
<p>答：誠然。但看宣言中關於南洋諸國的問題，竟保證馬來，婆羅洲，緬甸等仍為「英屬」，束印度仍為「荷屬」，菲律賓仍為「美屬」，這些巳在日本協助下解放獨立的南方新國，羅邱蔣會議竟企圖使他們重新陷入帝國主義舊秩序統治之下，更可看出開羅會議的眞面目了。</p>
<p>問：在東亞民族門爭的崗位上，我們對於開羅會議宣言自然只有憎惡的成分了。可是，德黑蘭會議又如何？</p>
<p>答：羅邱史會議，喧傳已久，上次莫斯科三國外長會議，各方面似乎頗加重視，我們就巳指出：這不過是為羅邱史會議的準備而巳，可是，結果給人的印象，却只是「虎頭蛇尾」四字。從這次會議的任務說·一方面是繼續莫斯科會議的原則，進而確定共同對德的戰略方針，另一方面是由三巨頭親自商定戰後的國際對策方針。現在除了宜言「從北，東，南三方向德國合攻」之外，只不過發表了一篇關於伊朗問題宣言，無怪美國與論，對德黑蘭會議，幾乎一致表示失望，而蘇聯方面，也認為有繼續舉行二次三次會議之『絕對必要」了。</p>
<p>問：如此看來，開羅會議和德黑蘭會議只是反軸心國內部矛盾發展與國際局勢演變中的兩齣挿劇，根本不値得重視了？</p>
<p>答：那也並不盡然·從開羅到德黑蘭會議的舉行及其結果，多少已經顯示反軸心詣國對於目前戰局之重視，相互間某種程度的了解，和對中立國進行新的誘脅的企圖，因此，不問為歐洲或為東亞，都應認淸這一事實，團結一致，强化自巳的戰力，以保衛民族解放及新秩序的推進。</p>
<h3>日空軍繼績轟炸新幾內亞各機場　英承認中抬平洋作戰困難</h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　據南太平洋日軍某基地訊，新幾內亞方面日陸軍航空部隊·十二日八時三十分以戰鬥轟炸機編隊，空襲馬拉瓦薩機塲，日戰鬥機隊與敵p40型機四五架交戰，擊落其兩架（內一桀未證實）·聶炸　隊則猛炸停於陸上之敵機十餘架，其中四架巳中彈起火，其後並有兩處設施中彈起火，此次戰鬥，日機自炸一架。又是日另一機隊並於下午三時轟炸天比機場·該機場內有三地中彈起火。</p>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　南太平洋某基地電，日海軍機於十三日夜　　擊新幾內亞島東端之格德納夫及特羅布黑安島之敵飛機塲及軍事設施，格德納夫島有二處，特羅布里安島有三處中彈起火焚燒，日機全部安返基地。</p>
<p>東京十四日中央社電據南太平洋某基地電。日軍於十二月一日　　迄十日間，在新機內亞島瓦洛附近所獲綜合戰果如次：殲滅敵軍五六二名，俘虜三名，擊破敵軍車三輛·沉魚雷艇五艘。　獲品計有迫擊砲　三，重機槍六，輕機槍六，自動也槍五，步槍二五，手榴彈三·另其他　　極移。日方之損害，戰死八六名。</p>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　據南太平洋基地電，十日由敵統一式B24型機共二十餘架，分數次來　馬紹爾羣　之米軍勒島，日戰鬥機隊即對之邀擊，擊落其五架·日機一架受創。</p>
<p>里斯本十四日中央社電反軸心車　自美軍於吉　貝　羣島登陸　　作戰，遭空前損失後，對中部太平洋進攻作戰之價値，頗招疑念，迄最近更趨顯著。英紀事報近會戰達拉瓦登作戰事賽，指出中太平洋進攻　作戰爲不可能，據謂：根據達瓦島等陸作戰之各種消息及照片等，可　知美軍已　　人之　　。是以紀念確認中太平洋之進攻作戰，實有若干困難。按美海軍於達拉瓦島等陸時·會分來運船向達拉瓦島海岸前進，因遭日軍砲火猛擊，多被擊沉或阻止，乃不得不改味殆無裝甲之敵艇。日軍之猛烈砲火向海岸前進，其攻擊之第一日，迄深夜亦未獲得立足點。　英國軍事家亦會作悲觀論稱：中太平洋一帶，仍有無　如達拉瓦島之珊瑚島村在，相繼攻克此等島　，須較於達拉瓦島作戰受電大之犧牲。</p>
<h3>日軍防衛緬甸　布堅固陣地　敵無意戰爭逃亡衆多</h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　據緬甸前錢某地十四日電，美英因　敗之集　，乃狂呼　　反攻，彼　等為呼應太平洋各戰統　進攻，今又宣傳由印緬國境奪囘緬甸·然對此其害任者東南亞細亞反軸心軍司令官蒙特巴頓並朱發表任何論調，惟英印軍司令官奧辛列克曾言及緬甸奪囘之困難。蓋淪緬邊境之日軍，巳在怒江沿綫佈有繫固之陣地，以進迫渝軍後方基地，印緬國境日軍又正待機進攻印度、故敵方烏合之衆，實難動搖日軍毫舉。况英印軍之逃亡事件，又陷八不易彈壓之地步中，若觀察雨期後之敵方動靜，即可知敵軍將來反攻之動向矣·英國在印度之苦慣·因自由印度臨時政府之誕生。典印度食糧之恐慌異形加深。印度民衆反英運動亦俄然熾烈·印度兵之動搖·遂成爲公內部危機之濟勢力，於是敵　近乃以之爾肅之名義將第一綫之印　　力，由非洲派來之軍隊互相調換，又敵軍陣營·因指揮之不統一，頻起內訌，由俘虜口中·得知眞相。又渝軍之裝備興編織，為純美國式，指揮官亦幾全係美人，面當日軍進攻怒　西岸之際，渝方當局所以袖手傍觀者，實因為與美國將校不　合作也。同時彼等又深如該地區軍旅之裝備與訓練，均未達到定全之狀態，實不足興日軍對抗，再　東而之敵軍，聞日軍消息即汲汲於防衛之準備，據最近之消息，該方面之敵軍　亡者已均逃亡者約有二百人，兵士之無意戰爭可知矣，但緬甸前　之日軍精銳，更以緊決之鬥志，等待殲滅，故防衛緬甸之鐵壁，更愈形堅固矣。</p>
<p>日軍出擊緬甸渝軍</p>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　據緬甸前綫日軍某印渝軍現象　　印北部國境方面集結大君·有　　自緬甸北部實行反攻作戰之勢·乃於十一月末一　出擊·粉碎渝軍之保衛態勢·戰事目下仍在過行中</p>
<p>卡爾斯保擊落敵機</p>
<p>東京市四日中央社電　緬甸日軍前綫某基地十四日電·日陸軍機隊曾於十日偵察淪軍航空路在卡爾斯保上空與　擊之敵機展開空戰，擊落敵PC型機四架，B25型機一架，P40型機七架，（內一架未經證實）P25型機一架，共十三架，日方自炸及未返者有四架。</p>
<p>里斯本十四日中央社電　據新德里電，美第十陸軍航空隊司令官　維生少將，頃談稱，緬甸方面日軍航空兵力極强，美空軍於兩季過後，巳遭遇强烈之攻擊云。</p>
<h3>日機襲桂林</h3>
<p>廣州十四日中央社電　日陸軍要隊於十二日正午以戰鬥及轟炸數十架連合編隊再度空龔桂林，猛　淪軍兵營地帶及炸藥庫當由但處發生大火災，炸毀機塲上渝機五架，同時與迎擊之渝P/38型P/47p81型飛機二十餘架　　展開激戰，擊落戰擊毀其，P40十八架，其中六架未證實，P38型二架，未經設實，計二十架日機，此役亦有未返還七架。</p>
<h3>廣九綫　日軍戰果</h3>
<p>廣州十四日中央社電　華南日軍與香　防衛軍自於廣九鐵路沿錢展開掃蕩作戰以來，巳為時月餘，討伐盤據於該地之渝共軍，予以激底肅淸，迄今巳達成蕭濟戰之第一階段，茲　所獲戰果如次：渝共軍棄屍一六八，俘虜一三五，鹵獲自動火砲九，步槍一〇九八，手溜彈一〇六云。</p>
<h3>加爾各答被炸　營房極衝動　東印各地陷恐怖狀態</h3>
<p>仰光十四日中央社電　日陸·海軍戰鬥機·轟炸機聯合　隊，前於五日盡往炸加爾各答市·實予敵方以莫大衝動，新德里廣播亦承認所受打擊甚大。據當局所得之消息稱：因日機此次轟炸加爾各答市，軍事設施受創頗鉅，而受打擊最重者為一紀印人，實為英·印政府及英·美軍事關係機關之人員。善彼等過付，加爾各之安全性，以為市內設有多數高射砲，儼然為一巨大之防禦要塞，日機此次不能侵入，及遭受此次猛炸，其信念途更恐怖。此次轟炸中首先逃出市外者為英美人，市內著名繁華街上之英美商店皆停閉，人員則趨印度四部孟買等安全　　難，加爾各政府關係機關之職　　　碼頭工廠之工人，亦大批避難，於是市內電車，公共汽車均停駛，港灣附近之娥路，軍事都市之機能途完全停頓，迄今秩序尙未恢復。英印政府對大批勞工逃往市外避難之事極感狼狽，宣傳長官阿美德曾竭力利用報紙無綫電向勞工呼　，迄未突效，日機轟炸之影響，巳自加爾各答波及東部印度各地，刻維查巴達姆科羅那大及馬德加斯三地均陷於恐怖狀態中。尤堪注目者，轟炸以後印兵之不穩氣氛更行濃厚，又時時發生英國士官與印兵衝突及印兵大批逃亡事件，東部地區司令部最近頻向新德里英軍　司令部請示對付全部印兵之方策　望　派要員前往。</p>
<h3>牛頭山附近　渝軍被擊潰</h3>
<p>漢口十四日中央社電　據華中前綫電，國軍某部隊於　南前綫與日軍並肩作戰，最近於牛頭山（灃縣南十八里）附近，攻擊被日軍擊潰之渝第四十四軍　存兵力約一師，目下正在掃蕩中。</p>
<h3>鮑斯在爪哇　演說要旨</h3>
<p>爪加爾達十四日中央社電　印度　時政府主席江特拉鮑，日前抵此，十一日並出席於爪加爾達創場舉行之印傳大會，即席致尙，要旨如次，余認為甘地氏於一九二一年以來所抱之不抵抗主義，不能實現印度之自由獄中之生活，更不能發生何效果也，故余乃離開印度。現印度巳由大東亞戰爭中為爭取印度之獨立，而直接奪鬥，常余開新加坡陷落之報，即深悟英國之國力已在急速崩潰中，英軍之無能，益增加我人鬥爭之男氣，故美國縱予以援助，英國之崩潰，巳　必然，華維爾與蒙特巴　亦祇為美國之傀儡而已。印度政府巳經十九國之承認，並獲得由日本護與之安達曼。尼科巴兩羣島。余巳曾被　於緬旬監獄，日前訪問緬甸，目時英國勢力，悉巳蕭淸，極感快慰，印度亦必將有如此之一日也。我人現巳有軍隊，刻更受日本及大束亞十億民衆，在精神與物質之支援，我人巳枕戈準備進軍祖國，希同胞諸君出我人之力量與財源、貫澈此次戰爭，以獲得最後勝利。</p>
<h3>粵北流行　惡性瘧疾</h3>
<p>廣州十四日中央社電　據韶顯大公報消息，最近專北一帶流行惡性　疾，因藥品缺乏，事態基嚴重。據渝廣東省政府衛生處發表，迄十一月未僅韶關市內患者巳逾十萬人，刻仍逐日增加，因金難納霜不易購買，致市內區藥充斥，因而延誤被害者亦甚多。當局對此刻正努力取締，同時該地區並發生天花，又值天氣日寒，衣食缺乏，致渝方治下民衆生活，陷於悲慘不堪曾云。</p>
<h3>葵大使款宴　京市長一行</h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　中國駐日大使蔡培，今下午六時宴請南京市長周學昌等一行，因蔡大使為前任南京市長，故對爾京近况極為關　。又本日中午蔡大使並曾宴請來日訪問之四藏活佛阿旺益喜·蒙古活佛羅　巴　，及監家阿　巴喜等一行九人·席間並有日大東亞省中國事務局長答　美登多人作　。</p>

<h3>日將向議會提出　七項法律案要綱　昨日定例閣議中已經决定</h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　日政府本日十時在首相官邸舉行定例閣議，東條首相及全體閣僚均出席，首由星野書記官長說明將在第八十四屆議會中提出七法律案之要綱，當經決定。繼由森山法制局長官就官廳事務簡索化之成績報告稱：　廢止官廳行政事務或使之簡索化，　許可認可事項等之整備。　中央官廳權限移交地方官廳管理者，達一九三八件之多。此外，並決定實行第二第三之整備官廳之權限，儘量移交地方官廳，迄十一時餘始散會</p>
<h3>日明年度總預算　一五二億四千三百萬元</h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　日政府昭和十九年度，一般會計歲入歲出之預算總額，已經十日閣議決定為一百五十二億四千三百萬元，此較本年度最初預算之九十九億九千五百萬元，已增加五十二億四千八百萬元，包括第八十一·二·三屆議會迫加預算之一百西十億二千四百萬元之本年度歲出預算，比較亦增十二億一千九百萬元，此誠為　應戰爭第三年決勝期之龐大預算，且今後因增稅案之追加預算，與因追加臨時軍事費預算、以及關於企業整備方面補助金，疏散人口建築物之經費等，一切歸入追加預算中之經費，亦達相當巨額，故預料明年度預算額，恐即將達於二百億左右之龐大數額，關於此預算案中最堪注目者，即此驚人巨額，乃前所未有，其內容應値注意之處尤多，第一·即於此前閣議盡全力所決定之十項重要政策之優先預算化，此十項經費即達十五億元以上·其目的可謂巳首先達成、明年度以增强戰力應以飛機為中心，充實國內防術體制，確保國民戰時食　為重點之預算，實巳具備戰時預算之心格。第二，即根據强化預算伸縮性之旣定方針，較十八年度已再增加第一預備金二千萬元，第二預備金五億元，而擁有二十一億元之預備金，此二十一億元之預備金，即佔歲出總額百分之十四，此巳相當中日事變之歲出總額。第三·根據預算徹底單純化方針，巳使預算科目之整理工作通融性，亦見增大，而且備適應決戰階段之機動性。總而言之，明年度之預算，巳自預算之形式內容中，抹去一切非戰時色彩而形成純戰時預算，且明年度預算，僅觀其政治預算之一般會計預算，亦可知其梗槪，惟其全貌則須待臨時軍事費預算之追加　決定後，始能明瞭。此臨時軍事費追加預算，將達如何之巨額、固難預測，但想絕不突破本年度之二百七十億元，故明年度之預算總額，巳可知為劃期之決戰預算，日本一億國民，亦將欣然接受政府之施策，努力增加軍　物資生產，增强國民貯蓄，以適應此大預算之實施。</p>

<p>經濟界</p>
<h3>評言　五百元券</h3>
<p>最近兩週以來，物價漲風漲漫，以至於一切不合理的繁榮，都是原於中儲行將發行五百元券的謠言：如今，問財長對中央社記者聲稱，「此事純屬無稽之詰，因中然行發行極為健全，絕無發行五百元劵之必要。』從此社會民衆，自可釋然於懷、至少不至加强物值看高，幣値看低的心理了。</p>
<p>提起五百元劵的一種謠言，我們不由得又要想到中　劵的今後體題了。自非絕對不知經濟學為何物者，都知道戰時物價能否趨平，須視通貨有無辦法。在中儲券已經逐漸趨於一色化的今日，照理人民公衆對於中儲券的僧仰，即不應眩時常發生懷疑的心理，而政府方面的責任，則在於使中儲券用自力來强化自己，使其自成為唯一可靠的流通貨幣；同時，在可能範圍內，要使人民公衆瞭然於國家通貨的發行額，使其無由發生通貨不斷膨賬的觀念。總之一句話，中儲券的實際强化，乃為抑平物價，安定民生的唯一途徑，其他一切一切的物價政策，都不過是屬於洽標的。</p>
<h3>銀錢業獎動勵儲蓄　提高存款利率　吸收社會游資從事生產</h3>

<p>頃據記者向銀錢業探悉，各行莊巳參酌市面情形，各自提高存款利息，（包括儲蓄信託以及普通各存款，）聞普通往來存款週息，巳提至四厘至六厘，定期存款以週息一分為最低，視定期年數而定，錢業商業往來存息按月提至五元以上，至於放款利，亦已分別提高，　一般合月息三分，惟視各往來之信用而各自商定，並聞滬巿各行莊目前存款，活期較定期為多，而歷史悠久信用素著之各銀行，平均存款均在一萬萬元以上云。</p>

        <h1>1943.12.15</h1>
<h3>From Cairo to Tehran—International Questions and Answers</h3>
<p>Question: Since the Cairo Conference of the United States, Britain, and Chongqing and the Tehran Conference of the United States, the Soviet Union, and Britain each issued their declarations, they have aroused considerable discussion among the general public. What is the significance of these two conferences?</p>
<p>Answer: In essence, these two conferences are entirely consistent. However, from the perspective of the actual world situation, they are quite different. The consistency lies in the fact that in the new stage of the current world war, due to the new developments on all fronts of the Axis powers, and the evolution of the war situation in Europe and Asia, it is necessary for the anti-Axis countries to achieve coordination in their war strategies and political issues between each other. This is a consistent requirement. The differences lie in the fact that the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and Chongqing have different intentions and positions, and even have many difficult-to-resolve contradictions between them. Chongqing could not participate in the US-Soviet-British conference, and the Soviet Union had the dilemma of having to avoid participating in the US-British-Chongqing conference. The most important point here is the subtle existence of Japanese-Soviet relations and the contradictions between the Soviet Union and Chongqing. Everyone knows that Stalin is a famous realist today. He will never accommodate the Chongqing regime that is currently embroiled in friction with the Communists, and he cannot ignore the serious consequences of violating the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact.</p>
<p>Question: In that case, the fact that the Cairo and Tehran conferences were held separately indicates that the greatest contradiction among the anti-Axis countries has not yet been eliminated. However, the results of the Roosevelt-Churchill-Chiang conference have already been announced. What are the results and trends of the Cairo Conference?</p>
<p>Answer: The Cairo Conference lasted five days and discussed three issues: first, military issues; second, the purpose of the war; and third, the issue of seizing Japanese colonies. However, the Cairo Conference also had the distinction between the Roosevelt-Chiang conference and the Roosevelt-Inonu (Turkish President Inonu) conference. The latter's discussion focused on the Pacific issue, while the former's discussion was entirely a method for Britain and the United States to prevent Chiang from "wavering" and to win him over. In fact, what Chiang Kai-shek got was only empty promises. He could not but admit the fact that the anti-Axis world strategy "continues to prioritize dealing with Germany". Therefore, what did Chiang Kai-shek bring back from this trip? This is indeed a big question.</p>
<p>Question: So, the Cairo Conference was actually just a new development of the United States and Britain's psychological warfare, and it doesn't seem to have any significance.</p>
<p>Answer: Indeed. But looking at the issues concerning the countries of Southeast Asia in the declaration, it guarantees that Malaya, Borneo, Burma, etc. will remain "British", the Dutch East Indies will remain "Dutch", and the Philippines will remain "American". These new countries in the South that have been liberated and made independent with the help of Japan, the Roosevelt-Churchill-Chiang conference actually attempted to make them fall back under the rule of the old imperialist order, which shows the true face of the Cairo Conference even more clearly.</p>
<p>Question: Standing on the position of the East Asian nations' struggle, we naturally only have hatred for the Cairo Conference declaration. But what about the Tehran Conference?</p>
<p>Answer: The Roosevelt-Churchill-Stalin Conference had been publicized for a long time. The previous Moscow Conference of the Three Foreign Ministers seemed to be taken quite seriously by all parties. We had already pointed out that this was just a preparation for the Roosevelt-Churchill-Stalin Conference. However, the result gave people the impression of just being a "big fanfare for nothing". From the perspective of the tasks of this conference, on the one hand, it was to continue the principles of the Moscow Conference and further determine the common strategic policy against Germany. On the other hand, it was for the three giants to personally discuss the postwar international countermeasures policy. Now, apart from declaring to "attack Germany jointly from the north, east, and south," only a declaration on the Iranian issue was issued. No wonder American public opinion almost unanimously expressed disappointment with the Tehran Conference, and the Soviet Union also believed that it was "absolutely necessary" to hold a second or third conference.</p>
<p>Question: In this case, the Cairo Conference and the Tehran Conference are just two interludes in the development of internal contradictions and the evolution of the international situation within the anti-Axis camp, and they are not worth paying attention to at all?</p>
<p>Answer: That's not entirely true. The holding of the Cairo to Tehran Conferences and their results have more or less shown the anti-Axis countries' emphasis on the current war situation, a certain degree of mutual understanding, and attempts to carry out new inducements and threats against neutral countries. Therefore, whether it is for Europe or for East Asia, we should recognize this fact, unite as one, strengthen our own combat power, to defend national liberation and the promotion of the new order.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Continues to Bomb New Guinea Airfields, Britain Admits Difficulties in Central Pacific Operations</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – According to a South Pacific Japanese military base, on the New Guinea front, Japanese Army Air Force units, in formations of fighter-bombers, attacked the Marawasa airfield at 8:30 AM on the 12th. Japanese fighter squadrons engaged four to five enemy P-40 aircraft, shooting down two of them (one unconfirmed). The bomber squadrons heavily bombed more than ten enemy aircraft parked on the ground, four of which were hit and caught fire. Subsequently, two more facilities were hit and caught fire. In this battle, one Japanese aircraft was shot down by its own bombs. On the same day, another Japanese squadron bombed the Tebi airfield at 3 PM. Three locations within the airfield were hit and caught fire.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – A South Pacific military base reports that Japanese naval aircraft attacked enemy airfields and military facilities on Gedney Island and Trobriand Island at the eastern end of New Guinea Island on the night of the 13th. Two locations on Gedney Island and three locations on Trobriand Island were hit and caught fire. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – A South Pacific military base reports. The integrated battle results obtained by the Japanese army in the vicinity of Wau, New Guinea Island, from December 1st to the 10th are as follows: 562 enemy soldiers annihilated, 3 prisoners captured, 3 enemy vehicles destroyed, and 5 torpedo boats sunk. Captured items include 3 mortars, 6 heavy machine guns, 6 light machine guns, 5 automatic rifles, 25 rifles, and 3 hand grenades. In addition, other items were also seized in large quantities. The Japanese side suffered 86 battle deaths.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – A South Pacific base reports that on the 10th, more than twenty enemy unified B-24 aircraft came in several waves to attack Mili Island in the Marshall Islands. Japanese fighter squadrons immediately intercepted them, shooting down five of them. One Japanese aircraft was damaged.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) – Since the Anti-Axis forces suffered unprecedented losses in the operation of American troops landing on the Gilbert Islands, the value of the offensive operation in the Central Pacific has been doubted, and this has become more and more obvious recently. The British Chronicle recently reported on the Battle of Tarawa, pointing out that an offensive operation in the Central Pacific is impossible. It is said that according to various news and photos of the Tarawa Island landing operation, it can be seen that the American troops have already exhausted their manpower and resources. Therefore, it is acknowledged that the offensive operation in the Central Pacific is actually somewhat difficult. According to the American Navy, when landing on Tarawa Island, it will send transport ships to advance to the coast of Tarawa Island. Because they were fiercely attacked by Japanese artillery fire, many were sunk or stopped, so they had to change the flavor to enemy boats with almost no armor. The fierce artillery fire of the Japanese army advanced to the coast, and it did not gain a foothold until late at night on the first day of the attack. British military experts have also pessimistically stated that in the Central Pacific, there are still countless coral island villages like Tarawa Island, and successively conquering these islands will require greater sacrifices than the battle of Tarawa Island.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Defends Burma, Builds Solid Positions, Enemy Has No Intention to Fight, Many Flee</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from a front line in Burma on the 14th reports that due to the repeated defeats, the Americans and British are frantically clamoring for a counter-offensive. In order to respond to the attacks of the Pacific war zones, they are now also spreading propaganda about recapturing Burma from the India-Burma border. However, the commander of the Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Forces, Mountbatten, and Zhu have not made any remarks about this, but the commander of the British Indian Army, Auchinleck, has mentioned the difficulty of recapturing Burma. The Japanese army on the Burma border has already deployed solid positions along the Nu River line to approach the rear base of the Chongqing army. The Japanese army on the India-Burma border is also waiting for an opportunity to attack India. Therefore, it is difficult for the enemy's disorganized forces to shake the Japanese army's actions. Moreover, the desertion incidents of the British Indian Army have also made it difficult to suppress. If we observe the enemy's movements after the rainy season, we can know the future counter-offensive trend of the enemy army. The suffering of Britain in India is due to the birth of the Provisional Government of Free India. The food panic in India has deepened. The anti-British movement among the Indian people has also become increasingly fierce. The wavering of the Indian soldiers has become a public internal crisis. Therefore, the enemy recently replaced the first-line Indian troops with troops sent from Africa in the name of the "New Deal". Moreover, in the enemy camp, internal conflicts frequently arise due to the disunity of command. The truth is known from the mouths of prisoners. Moreover, the equipment and organization of the Chongqing army are purely American-style, and the commanders are almost all Americans. Therefore, when the Japanese army attacked the west bank of the Nu River, the Chongqing authorities stood by and watched, because they did not cooperate with the American officers. At the same time, they also deeply understand that the equipment and training of the military in the area have not reached a certain state, and it is not enough to confront the Japanese army. Furthermore, the enemy to the east, upon hearing the news of the Japanese army, is eagerly preparing for defense. According to recent news, about 200 soldiers have deserted from the enemy army in that area, indicating that the soldiers have no intention of fighting. However, the elite Japanese troops on the Burmese front are waiting to annihilate them with firm determination. Therefore, the iron wall of defense in Burma is becoming increasingly solid.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Attacks Chongqing Army in Burma</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – According to a certain front line in Burma, the Japanese army noticed that a large number of Indian and Chongqing troops were gathering on the northern border of India, with a posture of launching a counter-offensive operation from northern Burma. Therefore, at the end of November, it launched an attack to crush the Chongqing army's defensive posture. The battle is currently underway.</p>
<p>Carlsborg Shoots Down Enemy Aircraft</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – A certain base on the Burmese Japanese army front line reports that on the 10th, the Japanese army air squadron patrolled the air route of the Burmese army and engaged in an air battle with the intercepted enemy aircraft above Carlsborg, shooting down four enemy PC aircraft, one B25 aircraft, seven P40 aircraft (one unconfirmed), and one P25 aircraft, totaling thirteen aircraft. The Japanese side had four aircraft shot down by their own bombs or failed to return.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from New Delhi, Major General Davison, commander of the U.S. Tenth Air Force, recently stated that the Japanese air force in Burma is extremely strong, and the U.S. Air Force has encountered strong attacks after two seasons.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Attack Guilin</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 14th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Army's main force, in a joint formation of dozens of fighters and bombers, once again bombed Guilin at noon on the 12th, fiercely attacking the enemy's barracks area and the ammunition depot.

<h3>Calcutta Bombed, Barracks Extremely Shocked, Eastern India Falls into a State of Terror</h3>
<p>Yangon, 14th (Central News Agency) – The joint squadron of Japanese Army and Navy fighters and bombers bombed the city of Calcutta on the 5th, giving the enemy a great shock. New Delhi Broadcasting also admitted that the damage was great. According to the information obtained by the authorities, the military facilities in Calcutta were severely damaged by the Japanese aircraft bombing, and the most severely affected were a group of Indians, who were actually personnel from the British Indian government and British and American military relations agencies. Because they had previously overestimated the security of Calcutta, thinking that there were a large number of anti-aircraft guns in the city, which was like a huge defensive fortress, the Japanese aircraft could not invade this time and were subjected to this fierce bombing, their beliefs turned into even more terror. The first to flee the city during the bombing were the British and Americans. The British and American shops on the city's famous bustling streets were closed, and the personnel went to safe places such as Bombay in the four parts of India to take refuge. The officials of the Calcutta government relations agencies and the workers of the docks and factories also took refuge in large numbers. As a result, trams and buses in the city were suspended, and the functions of the docks near the harbor and the military city were completely paralyzed, and order has not been restored to this day. The British Indian government was extremely embarrassed by the large number of workers fleeing the city to take refuge. Propaganda officer Ahmed tried his best to use newspapers and radio to appeal to the workers, but it was ineffective. The impact of the Japanese aircraft bombing has spread from Calcutta to various parts of eastern India. Now, Visakhapatnam, Coromandel, and Madagascar are all in a state of terror. It is especially noteworthy that after the bombing, the unstable atmosphere of the Indian soldiers became more intense, and incidents of British officers and Indian soldiers clashing and Indian soldiers fleeing in large numbers occurred from time to time. The Eastern District Command has recently frequently requested the New Delhi British Army Headquarters to request countermeasures against all Indian soldiers, hoping to send important personnel to go there.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Army Defeated Near Niutoushan</h3>

<h3>Key Points of Bose's Speech in Java</h3>
<p>Jakarta, 14th (Central News Agency) – Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, arrived here the other day. On the 11th, he attended the Indian Congress held at the Jakarta Stadium and delivered a speech on the spot. The main points are as follows: I believe that Gandhi's policy of non-resistance since 1921 cannot realize the freedom of India, and life in prison cannot have any effect. Therefore, I left India. Now India is directly fighting in the Greater East Asia War to win India's independence. When I opened the report of the fall of Singapore, I deeply realized that Britain's national power was rapidly collapsing. The incompetence of the British army has increased our fighting spirit. Therefore, even if the United States provides assistance, the collapse of Britain is inevitable. Wavell and Mountbatten are also just puppets of the United States. The Indian government has been recognized by 19 countries and has obtained the Andaman and Nicobar Islands from Japan's protection. I have been imprisoned in the Burmese prison. I visited Burma the other day and was very happy to see that the British forces have been completely cleared out. India will also have such a day. We now have an army and are now receiving spiritual and material support from Japan and the one billion people of Greater East Asia. We are ready to march into our motherland, hoping that our compatriots will contribute our strength and financial resources to carry out this war and win the final victory.</p>
<h3>Malignant Malaria Epidemic in Northern Guangdong</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 14th (Central News Agency) – According to news from the Shaoguan Dagongbao, a malignant malaria epidemic has recently spread in the Zhuanbei area. Due to the lack of medicine, the situation is very serious. According to the Guangdong Provincial Government Health Department of Chongqing, by the end of November, more than 100,000 people have been infected in Shaoguan City alone, and the number is still increasing day by day. Because it is difficult to buy quinine cream, counterfeit drugs are rampant in the city, which has delayed many victims. The authorities are currently working hard to crack down on it. At the same time, smallpox has also occurred in the area. Moreover, the weather is getting colder day by day, and there is a lack of food and clothing, which has caused the people under the rule of Chongqing to live in a miserable situation.</p>

<h3>Japan to Submit Seven Draft Laws to the Parliament, Outlines Already Decided in Yesterday's Regular Cabinet Meeting</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government held a regular cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence at 10 AM today.

The meeting adjourned after 11 AM.</p>
<h3>Japan's Total Budget for Next Year is 15.243 Billion Yen</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) – The total amount of the general accounting revenue and expenditure budget of the Japanese government for Showa 19 (1944) has been decided by the cabinet meeting on the 10th to be 15.243 billion yen. This is an increase of 5.248 billion yen compared with the initial budget of 9.995 billion yen this year. Compared with the expenditure budget of 14.224 billion yen for this year, including the supplemental budgets of the 81st, 82nd, and 83rd sessions of the Parliament, it has also increased by 1.219 billion yen. This is truly a huge budget to respond to the decisive phase of the third year of the war. Moreover, in the future, the additional budget for the tax increase plan, the additional temporary military expenditure budget, and the expenses for subsidies for enterprise consolidation and the construction of buildings for population evacuation will all be included in the additional budget, which will also reach a considerable amount. Therefore, it is expected that the budget amount for next year will reach a huge amount of about 20 billion yen. The most noteworthy thing about this budget proposal is this astonishing huge amount, which is unprecedented. There are many things in its content that should be paid attention to. First, the priority budgeting of the ten important policies decided by the cabinet meeting with all its strength before this. The expenses for these ten items reached more than 1.5 billion yen, and the goal can be said to have been achieved first. Next year's budget, which focuses on enhancing combat power with aircraft as the center, enriching the domestic defense system, and ensuring the wartime food supply of the people, already has the essence of a wartime budget. Second, based on the established policy of strengthening the flexibility of the budget, the first reserve fund has been increased by 20 million yen compared with Showa 18 (1943), and the second reserve fund is 500 million yen, with a reserve fund of 2.1 billion yen. This 2.1 billion yen reserve fund accounts for 14 percent of the total expenditure, which is equivalent to the total expenditure of the Sino-Japanese War. Third, based on the policy of thoroughly simplifying the budget, the work of consolidating the budget items has been made more flexible, and the adaptability to the decisive stage has also been increased. In short, the budget for next year has been removed from the form and content of the budget, all non-wartime colors have been removed, and a pure wartime budget has been formed. Moreover, the political budget and the general accounting budget can only give a rough idea of the budget for next year, but the full picture can only be understood after the additional temporary military expenditure budget is decided. It is difficult to predict how huge the additional temporary military expenditure budget will be, but it is thought that it will never exceed 27 billion yen this year. Therefore, it can be known that the total budget for next year is a landmark decisive battle budget. The 100 million people of Japan will also gladly accept the government's policies, work hard to increase the production of military materials, and increase national savings to adapt to the implementation of this large budget.</p>

<h3>People of Chongqing in Dire Straits</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Chongqing's economy has been further ruined by the war, and the people's situation is even more dire. This winter, the lives of Chongqing residents are extremely bleak. According to the Chongqing Daily Telegraph's Chongqing Report, the current situation in Chongqing is as follows: Chongqing is currently inhabited by three types of people: local residents, officials, and foreigners. The number of local residents has greatly increased due to the influx of people from the surrounding countryside. They are mostly engaged in commerce. There are approximately 200,000 officials, including their families, mostly from Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. As for the number of foreigners, excluding Anti-Axis soldiers, there are less than 1,000, mostly British, about 200. The number of Americans has recently increased and may soon exceed the British, as the number of U.S. diplomats stationed in Chongqing is gradually increasing. In addition, the United States has sent representatives and experts to Chongqing to oversee the implementation of the Lend-Lease agreement. The greatest difficulties faced by people in Chongqing, both Chinese and foreign, are approximately four: the difficulty of finding housing, the high cost of living, the inconvenience of transportation, and cultural isolation.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Announces Details of the Sinking of the Huatai; Bereaved Families Gather to Discuss and Demand Compensation</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: Regarding the sinking of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Huatai ship in Xingang, the company's spokesperson made the following statement: After receiving news of the Huatai ship's disaster in Xingang on the afternoon of the 10th of this month, the company immediately established a Huatai Disaster Handling Committee to begin various activities. It also telegraphed its Tiensheng Port resident to rush to Xingang to assist. At the same time, the company's Shanghai branch sent six personnel, carrying rescue supplies, on the Xuchang ship, which departed directly for Xingang that night. The following is an account from one of the dispatched personnel and the Huatai ship's first mate who returned yesterday:</p>
<p>The Scene of the Tragic Sinking</p>
<p>The ship arrived in port slightly later than scheduled, reaching Xingang at 7:00 PM on the 9th. At that time, the local passengers boarded more than 30 sampans and civilian boats. Before the passengers inside the ship disembarked, they rushed to the ship's bow and crowded down, and the captain and crew members could not stop them. As a result, both disembarking and boarding passengers gathered on one side of the deck, and the ship lost its center of gravity. The ship became unstable and tilted sharply. Water poured in through the side doors, rushing in rapidly and uncontrollably, and the ship sank almost instantly. At that time, Japanese [omitted characters] and [omitted characters] anchored near Xingang immediately sailed to the scene of the accident to make every effort to rescue the escaping passengers. As a result, the work was very difficult in the darkness, and with the assistance of various sampans and civilian boats, about 250 people were rescued. The whereabouts of most of the others are still unknown. The company's agent immediately lit fires to warm the rescued victims, provided them with food, clothing, and supplies, and diligently cared for them. At the same time, they made every effort to search for those whose whereabouts were unknown. Subsequent developments have not yet been reported.</p>
<p>Deep Regret for the Incident</p>
<p>The occurrence of this incident, ultimately resulting in the loss of numerous lives, property, and the ship at the bottom of the sea, is deeply regretted. To prevent the recurrence of similar incidents in the future, the company's committee immediately telegraphed ships at sea and in port, sending people to issue serious warnings to all ships entering the port. Furthermore, when passengers board and disembark a ship, they must respect public morality and must not lose self-control. At the same time, they must obey the instructions of the ship's authorities, which is the company's sincere wish.</p>
<p>Accounts from Passengers Who Escaped</p>
<p>According to passengers who escaped the Huatai and bereaved families who spoke to Central News Agency reporters: The Huatai Shipping Company stated that the cause of this accident was entirely due to passengers rushing to board the ship, disobeying order, causing the ship to lose its center of gravity, resulting in an unprecedented tragedy. However, the crowded conditions of passengers and cargo on the ship sailing to Xingang have not been for a day. It is really irresponsible to avoid taking appropriate precautions and measures on weekdays, and to merely make empty words of excuse after the accident. At the same time, regarding the issues of post-mortem arrangements for the deceased and compensation for the families, the company has not yet made any clear statements or arrangements, which is particularly disappointing. The bereaved families are currently gathering to discuss ways to negotiate with the company based on reason.</p>

<p>Yesterday's News Release Time: 7:05 PM</p>
<p>Economic World</p>
<h3>Commentary: 500 Yuan Notes</h3>
<p>In the past two weeks, the rising prices of goods have led to all kinds of unreasonable prosperity, all stemming from the rumors that the Central Reserve Bank would issue 500 yuan notes. Now, Finance Minister [omitted character] told Central News Agency reporters that "this matter is purely a groundless rumor, as the Central Reserve Bank's issuance is very sound and there is absolutely no need to issue 500 yuan notes." From now on, the public can rest assured and at least not strengthen the psychology of valuing goods higher and valuing currency lower.</p>
<p>Speaking of the rumor of 500 yuan notes, we cannot help but think about the future of Central Reserve Bank notes. Those who are not completely ignorant of economics all know that whether wartime prices can be stabilized depends on whether there is a way to control currency. Now that Central Reserve Bank notes are gradually becoming standardized, the public's trust in Central Reserve Bank notes should not be constantly doubted. The government's responsibility is to enable Central Reserve Bank notes to strengthen themselves through their own strength, making themselves the only reliable currency in circulation. At the same time, to the extent possible, the government should make the public aware of the amount of national currency issued, so that they have no reason to have the idea that the currency is constantly inflating. In a word, the actual strengthening of Central Reserve Bank notes is the only way to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods. All other price policies are merely temporary solutions.</p>
<h3>Silver and Banking Industry Encourages Savings, Increases Deposit Interest Rates, Absorbs Idle Social Funds for Production</h3>
<p>Under the leadership of the National Bank, various silver and banking firms are making every effort to encourage national savings in order to promote the inherent virtue of saving, absorb idle social funds for production, curb speculation and hoarding, and stabilize finance to ensure people's livelihood. In addition to holding thrift savings activities starting from the 8th of each month, they are jointly offering bonuses for fixed deposits as an incentive.</p>
<p>According to inquiries from reporters to the silver and banking industry, various firms have taken into account market conditions and have raised deposit interest rates (including savings trusts and ordinary deposits). It is reported that the weekly interest rate for ordinary current deposits has been raised to 4 to 6 li. The lowest weekly interest rate for fixed deposits is 1 fen, depending on the fixed term. The monthly interest rate for commercial current deposits at Qianzhuang has been raised to more than five yuan. The lending rate has also been raised separately, generally 3 fen per month, but is negotiated separately based on the credit of each transaction. It is also reported that current deposits in Shanghai banks are currently more than fixed deposits, and the average deposits of banks with a long history and established credit are over one hundred million yuan.</p>
<h3>Capital Increase for Banks, Extension Approved for Three Months</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Finance previously promulgated capital increase measures in order to consolidate the financial foundation of Shanghai. Starting from July 1st, all banks were ordered to complete the capital increase by the end of this month. Banks that fail to meet the Ministry's regulations by the deadline will be subject to penalties or ordered to suspend business. However, some older banks, seeking stability, plan to transfer profits into increased capital after the year-end closing this year. Therefore, at the beginning of this month, the Shanghai Banking Association submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for a six-month extension. A reporter learned from relevant sources that this request has been approved by the Ministry of Finance, and the deadline has been extended by three months to the end of March next year. Other capital increase regulations remain unchanged.</p>
<h3>Flour Committee's Wheat Purchases This Year</h3>
<p>Approximately Five Million Bags</p>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the Commercial and Statistical Council has achieved excellent results in the unified purchase of wheat this year. To date, the purchase volume is approximately 3.5 million bags, and it is expected that another 1.5 million bags can be purchased successively.</p>
<h3>Various Associations Eliminate Malpractices and Establish Trading Regulations</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that some businesses in the city still engage in illegal trading, the various industry associations of this city believe that these malpractices should be thoroughly eliminated. Therefore, they have specially drafted detailed trading regulations and notified all businesses to strictly abide by them. The purposes of establishing these regulations are fourfold: to assist the government in implementing economic policies; to promote the public welfare of businesses; to correct malpractices in business operations; and for businesses to jointly obtain and distribute raw materials. Once a business is found to be in violation of the industry regulations and evidence is found, the board of directors of the association will decide on the method of sanction, and those with serious circumstances will be reported to the relevant authorities for punishment in accordance with the law. These industry regulations are divided into two parts: price and business operations.</p>
<h3>Commercial Situation Summary</h3>
<p>Government Bonds: Yesterday's prices rebounded again, with Class C rising the most sharply. The rise in other varieties was less pronounced. This is just a temporary phenomenon due to short covering. Whether it can continue to rise depends on the sentiment of the market. Class A opened peacefully, then retreated slightly. After 10:30, the buying side suddenly gained the upper hand, rising sharply, with repeated high prices. The difference between high and low prices was seventeen or eighteen. The final price at noon was higher than the previous day. Because it has not been traded for a long time, it is roughly similar to the previous price. Class E was up by about a foot, and the trend seemed to be changing.</p>
<p>Call Loan Rate: The interbank call loan rate of the Banking Association was listed at 1 jiao and 8 fen, unchanged.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities: Amidst the calls for more supply and less demand, the price of candles soared. Baitishi set a new high price again. Matches and soap were still stable.</p>
<p>Cigarettes: Due to the scarcity of goods from the factories, Dingjin cigarettes were in good demand, and prices rose accordingly, especially the miscellaneous brands. The Yizhong factory's cigarettes also rose slightly.</p>
<p>Food: The market continued to rise yesterday. Exacerbated by rumors in recent days, the general public has added considerably, resulting in a surge in demand. Vendors took the opportunity to raise prices, and prices of both thick and thin rice were raised by several levels. Oil grains also rose by two or three levels. However, it was finally heard that the authorities will take measures to suppress it, and the upward trend in the future may be contained.</p>
<p>Rayon: Yesterday, it was weak first and then recovered, finally similar to the previous day. The closing price of 120 Denier Tianqiao was still 6 guan and 4 ban.</p>
<p>Industrial Raw Materials: It is still strong recently, especially caustic soda is more stable, white alkali is also strong, and Vaseline is close to the critical point.</p>
<p>Tea: The market is still becoming increasingly firm, mainly because the shipments of the trade associations are still not weak. However, the owners still intend to hold up, so buyers find it difficult to accept. The market situation is optimistic due to more demand and less supply. A total of 21 dan of green tea were handled by Shuntai Tea Firm, and 16 boxes of black tea and five of silk tea were handled by Ding Yuetai and other tea firms. According to people in the industry, the shipment of fried green tea and roasted green tea has not been weak in recent days, but the stock in the market is limited, so the selling price is expected to be good.</p>
<p>Woolen Cloth: Recently, affected by the fear of coal and electricity shortages, the cost of living has not been reduced. Raw materials are expensive and difficult to obtain. Due to various environmental factors, factory output has been reduced again, and manufacturing costs have increased. The stock in the market continues to be lacking, especially the shortage of non-rayon woolen cloth and bise, which is even more scarce and highly sought after, creating a situation where it is easy to rise and difficult to fall. Regardless of thick or thin, good or bad, all kinds of summer goods are rising or soaring. Silk and yarn fabrics, linings, etc., also have risen without falling.</p>

<p>Social Services</p>
<h3>A Diligent and Hardworking Scholarship Founder</h3>
<p>My uncle is a middle-aged businessman, and his words are essential and police. Those who listen to him are moved. Helping the poor is his nature, and he is praised for it and is happy to be close to people. He is the only person in his hometown who is enthusiastic about social services, and those who have benefited from him are countless. Later, due to the early death of his eldest son, he established a scholarship, one to commemorate the deceased and one to select good talents, so that some poor children could complete their studies. He also planned to expand it in order to reserve talents for the country and use them for the country. Unfortunately, due to the continuation of the war, he had to temporarily suspend it. Not long after, he co-founded another scholarship with others. Although the scope is small, his motives are deeply admirable. My uncle admires "Zeng Wenzhenggong Family Letters" very much, and often explains the meaning in the book to his children. My father is a person with both new and old ideas, often advising the elderly to refrain from stubbornness and despotism, and the young not to be extravagant and impetuous. He must often refer to ancient books and extract their essence to cultivate his character. There are often people from all walks of life visiting his door, some asking for advice, some sponsoring, and some requesting. In terms of material enjoyment, both he and his children still advocate simplicity. Plain clothes and simple meals are the family style. Zhu Zis family precepts are hung in the hall, not only for viewing, but also for practicing in every way. My uncle came from a poor background, starting from being a cargo receiver on a ship, and then to where he is today. He has experienced many hardships, but he encourages himself with diligence and frugality, strives to be self-disciplined, and treats others with forgiveness. His spirit of struggle and love is truly worthy of our imitation. (Zheng Dehong)</p>

<p>National Forum</p>
<h3>On National Vitality and National Strength</h3>
<p>— Chen He</p>
<p>National vitality includes Shen Yuan's explanation; In other words: how can politics and economics be integrated into the wartime system? In terms of political issues: if the foundation of war depends entirely on the number of people; therefore, we must maintain the wartime situation, protect the security of the national life. In terms of economic issues: such as eliminating the evils of the strong and weak, which are naturally created by liberalism. Unifying all resources, increasing wartime production so that it can contribute to the country, and distributing it to the front and rear, are its highest goals. Now, if the country wants to achieve these two goals, the first important thing is to establish a wartime social mechanism, so that the people, regardless of men, women, old and young, rich and poor, noble and Lu, can join the organization specified by the network home according to their abilities. To avoid all kinds of malpractices and self-destruction, only in this way can the national vitality be developed and the national strength restored. It is related to the stability and health of the national life; therefore, the clothing, food, housing and transportation of each national must be properly arranged. The following various organs of farmers, workers, businessmen, students, officials, soldiers, and local people must at least be state-owned or publicly owned. That is, nurseries, schools, hospitals, cafeterias, entertainment venues, dormitories, sports fields, flower stalls, police stations, wedding and funeral halls, cleaning services, public utilities, personnel guidance centers, etc. All things needed for life should be included in it and supplied equally. Or exchange with each other with strength. The gains and losses of this facility, the advantages and disadvantages, are not fully explained by the short text here; but at least it is enough to prevent the liberalism, maintain the natural increase in the population rate, and can be decided and managed, so that they can concentrate on their duties and give play to their abilities. Otherwise, even if there is a good policy, it will not be effective. The result is that the national vitality will inevitably be swallowed up by liberalism, which should not be underestimated!</p>
<p>Wartime economy is the lifeblood of modern participating countries. In particular, the implementation of material resources is the source of cultivating combat power. However, if the notification policy is not supported by wartime politics; then the national life will inevitably be unstable, officials will cheat for private gain, regardless of the interests of the country and the nation, and moral conscience will be completely destroyed. Then production will stagnate and resources will be buried. Even if we seek the implementation of the ruling policy, we will be powerless. If there is wartime politics to support it, and can eliminate the inner concept of private property, and destroy the root of liberalism, so that all production departments are economic; then divide them into categories, step by step, with the power of 450 million people, and close the resources, there will definitely be a great plan for production. Production is rich, and hundreds of industries are mutually prosperous, all working together for the same goal; under the banner of national strength, working hard. Then, the resources will be abundant, the unified policy will be completed, and there will be no shortage of supply!</p>
<p>The implementation of wartime political economy has been completed. We can then have great expectations. Our country has vast land and abundant resources, and a large population. If we can make use of it and unite 450 million people, at the same time, with the same treatment, the same education, sitting, living, drinking, eating, entertaining, and working, in the same dormitory, canteen, entertainment venue, and factory. "Exhaust their wealth, the land must be exhausted for its benefits, and the goods must be distributed!" Resources are piled up like mountains! How can national vitality be under prosperity! How can national strength not be abundant! May those who have a heart, do it well.</p>
<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>That year's New Year was very silent. There were no pine trees planted in front of the door, and there were families who did not have New Year cakes.</p>
<p>In the family of Zhenren, there was an added layer of unfortunate dark clouds. The father, who had always been as strong as a bamboo pole in Jiangnan, suddenly fainted from dizziness. According to the doctor's diagnosis, it was a stroke, but Ruozi did not believe that Zhenji, who had just turned fifty-eight years old, would really be but, the progress of the disease, day by day, confirmed the doctor's diagnosis. There was only one living room in the house, and in that living room, Zhenji, a patient with hemiplegia, was lying down. His distracted pupils were fixedly staring at the ceiling.</p>
<p>"What on earth is going on?"</p>
<p>Seeing this form, Ruozi was stunned by the disaster that fell from the sky. The center of the whole family, the bearer of all undertakings, suddenly fell ill for no reason, what will happen in the future-</p>
<p>Soon, her spirit had recovered, and she took care of the guest in the store herself. Her husband's cloth skirt was worn on her waist. The rice noodles were white all over her hair, and she was also infinitely compliant, a hardworking worker.</p>
<p>"Child, we must not be discouraged..." In her, there was no reason, only to settle down again, and every morning she had to go to the Hachiman Shrine to pray for a speedy recovery. She entrusted Kawauchi Town's Xiangzhi to send and mail the local specialty carp, take its raw blood, and drink it with the patient.</p>
<p>However, Zhenji's condition did not change in any way, from the first month to the second month.</p>
<p>"A stroke is a long-term disease - maybe it will last for three, five, or seven years"</p>
<p>The people who came to visit the patient said this. Ruozi and the children were already determined.</p>
<p>In February, it snowed heavily. Although it is said to be both countries, it is not that it does not snow. When Saigo Takamori raised his army, there was also the matter of marching in the snow, which is recorded in history. In the Showa years, there was also unprecedented snow. With the falling of the snowflakes, the patient's sleep became even deeper. From broad daylight until the lights were turned on, the snoring never stopped.

<p>Zhenren was the first to respond. Unlike his usual gentle appearance, without waiting for his mother's consent, he quickly ran towards the snowy night Taniyama Street. (VII)</p>
