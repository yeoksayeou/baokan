<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">祝中日文化協會　上海分會改組成立 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>中日文化協會上海分會改組就緒，已於昨日下午舉行改組成立大會。回憶三十年一月二十九日首次舉行成立大會時，其宜言中揭櫫二點：一則以求兩國文化之融會貫通；一則以冀東洋文化之創造。並釋之曰：關於兩國文化之融會貫通者，各於其優劣之間，以爲取舍之端，截長補短，　精咀華，殘闕者完整之，陳舊者革新之，發揚光大固有之文化，固係急務，融會吸收外來之文化，亦屬要圖。苟如是，中日文化之合作，庶可以互有借助，相得益彰。關於以冀東洋文化之創造者，中華民族具有五千年之歷史，遠溯唐虞以還，文物制度，蔚然可觀。日本立國，已及三千載，早期雖孕育於中國文化，但近代接受西洋科學以後，精神物質，均有顯著之成績，中日兩國，旣於文化上取得聯緊，各獻所長，自不難建立東洋文化之體系。</p>
<p>該會此次改組成立，其宜言中也揭櫫二點：一曰樹立東亞本位文化體系，一曰實踐政府戰時文化政策。我們綜觀兩次宜言之主旨，母寗說是都側重於文化交流一點，惟有先從兩國間文化的交流，才能樹立東亞本位文化體系。</p>
<p>從第一次該會成立以迄於今，已達兩年半以上，在這不算太短的過程中，試加切實檢討該會工作的成績，以中日文化交流一點而言，老實說，未能如理想中的成就，希望於這次刷新組織以後，迎頭趕上，以實現章程中規定的寮旨：「溝通中日兩國之文化；融洽雙方朝野人士之感情，並發揚東方文明，以期達到善鄰友好之目的」。</p>
<p>至於實踐事項，在該會章程第三條中已有具體規定，應行舉辦中日文化事業凡十四項。固然，這幾種事業都是非常重要，儘可能悉數與辦，可是，在環境與經費上，也許不一定都做得到，那末，就須斟酌緩急輕重，選擇幾種，集中精力先行舉辦，收獲效果後，漸次推及於別種事業，而普遍完成。譬如第二項之「各種著作翻譯刊物之發行」，自從大東亞戰爭發生以後，上海出版物的蕭條景象，介紹些什麼日本文化給中國人士？貢獻此什麼中國文化給日本人士？如果以此爲中日文化交流成績的衡量器，那末，太貧弱了，令人不會相信中日文化有交流的可能吧！因爲出版事業全部陷於停滯狀態，文化人著作家陷於生活困苦之中，每月出版圖書不及十種，縱是出版物都與中日文化交流有關的，也談不上發生效能，何况出版物又是偏於軟性的呢？所以，我們認爲該會今後的事業，應該側重於發行刋物，引起出版界，著作家的興趣，共同爲出版事業努力，蔚成蓬勃興盛的氣象，而從此確立文化交流的始基。此外，更輔以其他文化事業，全面促成該會所負的使命。</p>
<p>欲求事業的克舉，經費與人才二者不可缺一，人才是不可急切求得的，培養訓練須經過相當時間，不過，目前滯滬的文化人中，當然也不乏可以勝任及可以造就的，如果能够提高文化人待遇，使之無生活上的威脅，一定可以增加文化工作的效率。所以，人才問題，以文化人生活爲前提，而先獲解決，則當可引致。至於經費，則非有充足的數量，自難舉辦。因爲物價的高昂，人工隨之而增，紙張印刷，需用浩繁，並且偉大深遠之出版計劃，尤須儲備適應計劃的物質，源源接應，不致匱乏。所以，對於經費，無論如何，應從遠大處着眼，盡力籌足。中日雙方旣然互有認識文化交流的重要，爲期達成任務而需要的經費，似乎不應成爲問題的，否則空言交流，是決不會有實質的成效的。</p>
<p>最後，我們知道上海是中國文化的中心，是與日本在文化上最易接近的地域，中日文化交流，從上海率先推行，樹立始基，當然是最爲適當。而可以慶幸的，該會理事長，也是該會最高負資者是陳市長，而幹部負責者都是中日文化界知各之士，誠如該會陳理事長開會詞謂：「過去會員中以經濟界或公務人員爲多，而實際負專責者較少，欲推進本分會的事業頗爲困難。」因此，我們更期望陳理事長以下諸位今後積極的負起專責，消除過去的困難。經過相當時間以後，我們願拭目以觀該會事業的成就，也就是中日文化交流的成就，中日官民情感親密的成就。</p>

<p>代向農民轉致謝意</p>
<p>柏林四日中央中電　德國宣傳部長郭培爾博士，星期日乘秋妝感恩節之　會、在柏林體靑館民衆大會前，發表演說。重申德國民族不可動搖之團結一致及其爭取　後勝利之堅强決心、並代表德元首向德國全體農民　致感謝之意。郭培爾宣稱：德元首現正在行　為德國民族之生存與前途起　而領導戰爭，軍務倥惚，不能如平時之親自到會，郭氏指出，「在此戰爭第五年開始之時。德國竟能增加其麵包之醒給景，此事幾似神蹟實則大半當歸　於德國農民之勤力與效能」。郭　鄭重聲稱：「麵包與軍器　　和進行戰爭之先決條件。德國之軍火工業，經軍火部長史比　　士加以廣　之敢革後，其生　　已大見增加」，郭　於是代表元首與德國民族　向數百萬德國男女軍火工人致謝意。郭氏鄭重宣稱：「德國人民，尤其在敵人恐怖空襲區域內，所受之困難何等重大、　　元首知之最稔。敵人若以若干個人之懦怯，視爲德國國內反戰之表演。實爲莫大之錯誤。國社主義之德國內，反戰一　絕不存在，倫　與華盛頓方面若果夢想七月二十五日義大利巴特里奧政府之故事。亦能發生於德國，此實爲可笑之希望，此種希望完全基於對德國內部情形及人民之意志與決心絕對錯誤之見解」。郭氏　稱：第一，德國之領袖爲德元首。而非一個叛逆之國王，德國係一共和國，而非一專權之國家。第二，德國武裝軍隊中。無一貪生怕死之兵士，第三，經一九一八年十一月痛苦之經騐後，德國人民決不再受敵人之欺驅」。</p>
<p>論述戰局尖銳問題</p>
<p>郭氏之演說中，復述及目前戰局中若干尖銳之問題，關於空戰，渠宣稱：一過去數星期內，敵人之恐怖空襲雖略　鬆懈，我人必須預料其將來更再來　，若干空襲之不能實現，乃因天氣關係，蓋此時之　候，不容空軍部隊作大規模之飛行，同時，對於德國之防樂。亦有妨礙。在另一方面，德國之軍事防禦最近已大見增强與改進。殆無疑義，因此。亦千敵人以極重大之損害關放此點。反軸心各報已公用承認不諱，敵人之損失日見增大，甚至　後將東見增大」。郭氏續稱：「空戰在許多方面不　德　與反軸心國之科學戰，目下德國之科學正在突飛猛晋中。今後敵人在人力與物質二方面。均將蒙受　大之損失，將來敵人之成功，不再與其所用之人力與物力成正比例，屆時。敵人之所謂飛行堡壘。將成爲飛行棺材」。郭氏復稱：「空戰引起德國不少之困難固無疑，但空戰所在發生之地區，與敵人所希望者　全不同，無論如何，德國之軍火生產，決不　敵人之損害。而戰爭之順利進行、亦不致因敵之空襲而受嚴重之影響」.關於對敵人恐怖空襲所取之步驟，郭氏鄭重聲稱：德平民之防空。已大見增强，預料人民從此將更能克制局勢。郭氏述及德國各大都市移居人民之措施，並指出由於採取此項步驟之故，最近英機空襲柏林時，僅炸死兒童二名，關於報復事，郭氏宣稱：「英人若以爲德國之報復僅屬空言實傳。而無事實之表現，則實爲嚴重之錯誤，將來必有一日，英國將遭遇實際之經騐，德國發明家、技術家，工程師與工人等，將注意務使英。美之樹木不能生長全空中」。郭氏擅稱：「英，美若以爲德潛蜓之危險已被克服亦爲鉗誤，德國之工程學並未放棄潛艇戰」。</p>
<p>力能控制東錢局勢</p>
<p>關於東綫之戰事，郭氏稱：「德軍具有充分之實力，足以使好戰之布爾希維克主　者遠阻於德國疆界之外，德軍在此數星期內。正在進行分遣行動。敵人不久將明瞭此種仃動之意義。德軍於過去二年內，在東綫所佔領之廣大區域，使　軍得能進行流動戰、而無害於德軍勝利之機會，德國人民可靜觀東綫之發展。歐洲之東部若不予以明確之解決、將永為德國之患。至於布爾希維克主義問題。已無需費辭。各處對於布爾希維克之危險雖不公開承認。亦巳洞悉無遺。我人希望各中立國家以及西方之敵人，對於此等問題較之德軍在伏爾加作戰時予以更淸醒與更現實之觀察」。關於此點那氏稱：渠作此語，並非請求人之諒解或帮助，德人自覺力能控制局勢，但較小之中立國應對德國　示感意，而勿指摘其戰軍之行爲</p>
<p>中途投降必吿失敗</p>
<p>關於義大利之情形，郭氏稱：「義大利之情形。由於巴特里奧與義國王之叛逆而遭受嚴重之困難，該叛逆之集團，甘願以在義大利南部作戰之德軍交付敵人，作爲進入敵人陣營之代價，此種可恥之用意，已爲我政治與軍事之措施所克服，義首相　素里尼之獲救，在政治上成爲建立共和戰法西斯義大利之表微在軍事上德軍師團不費多時而解決巴特里奧之部隊」郭氏述及巴特里奧投降英美之十三條條件稱：「義大利之命運，證明無人能以欺騙之方法躲避戰事，此次戰爭如一列高速度之特別快車。任何人企關躍卜者，必折斷其頸，凡中途放下武器者。必吿失敗，此次戰爭並非爲觀念或政權之戰。亦非爲個人或意見之戰，而實爲民族及其生命前途權利與生存之可能而戰。戰爭與和平之間，並無選擇之餘地，所有者。僅爲非勝利即消　」。郭氏略述義大利事件之各附段後復稱：「英　　向羅馬與幕尼黑之進行，並未實現敵人仍在義大利大陸之南部，並正在抱怨德軍堅强之防禦，白尼埃伯與鄧扣克二役以後　英　　軍在歐洲領土上感覺德軍緊強之抵禦尚屬第一次。英、美軍此　將有　多之　會認識　軍之防禦力」</p>
<p>此次大戰爲歷史劇</p>
<p>關於英。美由西卞侵犯歐洲之意向，郭氏宣稱？「德國與蘇　間在等候英。美之侵犯歐洲，而不見其實現，敵人顯然以爲義大利之方法比較容易。但英。美軍迄今僅在歐洲之周綫作戰。而迄　接觸德軍防禦之核心。德軍已備下不少驚異之事。以待英。美軍之光臨。此次戰爭爲我國人歷史或甚至世界歷史中最大之戲劇。歐洲問題確切解決之可能，現已露其端　，國　主義之德國，將自知如何利用此機會，德元首即爲此事之模範」。</p>
<h3 id="c31">序論　歐戰與巴爾幹諸國（一） <a href="#c31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>軸心軍的撤退突尼西亞，反軸心軍的西西里登陸，義大利巴陀里奧政權的投降—因這地中海情勢的三級跳，巴爾幹諸國重又爲全世界听注意。德蘇同盟，德英的死戰，義希戰爭，德軍的進駐巴爾幹，德蘇開戰，以至於此次義大利的退出，在這四年來歐洲動亂的幾度轉變中，除土耳其外，其他巴爾幹各國，均糾集於德國的勢力節圍下，以至今日。</p>
<p>英美自占據西四里　，暫時得以奪囘地中海制海權，在這種作戰的立塲下，一面在和蘇聯之意料外的術突這種政治的立塲下，羅邱在奎貝克所舉行的會機，僅發表了極低調的共同聲明，說是討論束亞的作戰，而無聲無臭的閉幕了。</p>
<p>但全世界不是他們的這種宣傳所能欺朦的。事貝克會談的眞正的議題，乃是英美的對蘇態度，同時討諭歐洲的第二戰　，這是不難想、　　而　和此時，全世界又知道，所　開　策二戰綫，即在英美以　在西西里已獲勝利的目前情形下，在作戰上也決不輕易可致，何况又加上蘇聯問題，在政泊上更多一層困難。</p>
<p>在沒有開闢成功眞正能突破這困難的「第二戰綫」之前，欲打開和蘇聯的關係，固不必　，即在歐洲欲獲得勝利的機會，在英美方面　是無望的。</p>
<p>巴爾幹的處境</p>
<p>在巴特屋奧政權投降之前。中立國方面的情報，有的說英美在巴爾幹登陸，有的說在南法登陸，也有說在伊此利亞半島登陸，甚至於右人說在北歐登陸傳說紛紜，莫衷一是，總之，都是以這第二戰綫爲中心。所以如其考察英美何故進攻突尼西亞，何故在西西里登陸，這無非英美在探素　二戰綫的進門之階而已。而最有可能性的：似乎是從西西里出發，向一衣帶水之隔的南義或其　片阿爾巴尼亞登陸，　街巴爾幹。或者利用地中海的制海權，奪回克里特島，侵入多得堪尼斯羣島。在希臘建立進攻巴爾幹的橋頭堡。</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞油田和多瑙河鐵門的價値，爲英美希　制霸德國而垂涎三尺。莫如之何的東西，這在他們以爲唯右和蘇聯暫吿妥協，議定之後，才能設法進行。</p>
<p>在這意義上，此次巴特里奧不單對英美，即對蘇聯也聲明休戰，實有深長的意義，投降公佈之前蘇聯公然表示參與地中海作戰，實在說來，義大利的投降，決不祇是英美的力量，蘇聯在東部戰綫的壓力。亦與有力焉，所以這說朋了蘇聯對地中海和英美有同程度的關心。四日夜莫斯科廣播說：一蘇聯以和德義在戰爭狀態中，故此次當然參加北義作戰，而且以歐洲强國的地位　在地中海諸問題上。也不能毫不關心。蘇聯派遣代表至北非的自由法蘭西委員會，和埃及開始國交。英美二國代表所組織的反軸心地中海委員會，承認蘇聯代表的參加。這，事悄都是上述英美和蘇聯妥協的結果。在奎員克會談上，也可以看出英美二巨頭決定這種對蘇讓步。</p>
<p>這蘇聯對地中海的進出。常然也就是蘇聯對巴爾幹半島發曾權增大的意思。關於巴爾幹作戰，在英美和蘇聯之間。或許已成立某程度的妥協。</p>
<p>如其英美對蘇聯成立這種妥協，那麼最據困感者要算是土耳其吧！最近英美對土耳共的拉擺工作，漸見露骨。因最近土首相薩拉齊格的聲明：「土耳其政府並不以爲其對英美的關係是純粹中立的，」故反軸心陣綫即宣傳說土耳其接近英美，但即使這果然是土耳其把其傳統的中立政策變爲非文戰國政策之意思的表示，回顧其背後和蘇聯的關係時，實行　來是不能十分順利的。</p>
<p>土耳其的接近英美，最近的確頓形顯著，但反之，不能忽視蘇土關係的暗影，也正在日趨加深。這英美和蘇聯的不一致，保全了土耳其的中立。現在英美對蘇聯如果讓步，在土耳共正出了一肩冷汗哩！</p>
<p>英美的神經戰</p>
<p>向巴爾幹的軍事攻勢，姑暫不說，英美的神經戰，目前在巴爾幹接到最高潮。對舊南斯拉夫地區的反德恐怖團的援助，以義國駐屯軍的撤歸本國爲中心的對希職民衆的宜傳等，用盡一切宣傳的技倆，而所謂英美的「外交攻勢」進行熾烈的地方，大概是保加利亞吧！</p>
<p>這在保國的對德協力的國策上，雖毫無動搖，但在民旅上面，保國民衆感到和蘇聯是很接近的，這是歐洲，巴爾幹的在德蘇戰中唯一的排持中立的國家之原因。英美使用亡命的保人，每日三次作廣播宣傳，對先　鮑利斯國王的薨逝，雖該國王的從德國訪問而歸是在八月十五日，是薨逝的二星期以前的事悄，但也惡意宣傳。說該國于是被謀殺的。</p>
<p>而且傳說最近英國飛機常在保加利亞上空出沒，妝發傳單，英美的是否果將在巴爾幹登陸，固不能遽然斷定。但其對巴爾幹的神經戰，却的確是跟着歐洲戰局的深刻化而日趨熾烈。（木軍完，全文未完）（翔：　自同盟世界週報一二二六號）</p>

<p>中央社訉　中日文化協會上海分會為重新集結上海各種文化團體，展開更有力之文化活動，以實現中日基本條約之精神，及形成中日文化協力合作之核心起見，特於昨日下午三時，假座　飯店八樓，舉行改組成立大會。　市長以該會　備委員長資格親臨主持，林穴傳部長的尻公使均听自　臨指導。該會南京總會理事長褚部長特派張超公使代表出席，來賓到有中日各機關長官各界名流以及該會全體會員等不下五百餘人、躋躋一堂，盛况空前，儀式簡單隆重。聞會秦樂，由市府音樂隊　中日國歌，行禮後，陳市長主席</p>
<p>主席致辭</p>
<p>諸位先生，中日文化協會上海分會成立已經兩年，在過去兩年中，僅中日雙方的努力，已有很好的成績。只是上屆理事任期已滿，按章　即改組、這是本分會改組的一個原因。其次，本分會成立時，各界人士加入本分會者極為踴躍，惟會員中以經濟界　公　人員為多，而實際負專責者較少，欲推進本分會的事業頗為困難，這是本會改組的第二原因。復次，上海市政統一之後，租界的名詞已　　失，但租界　育成的英美恩想，知依然存在，欲　造此種思想，必須從文化方面着手，這是本分會改組的第三原因。自從國府　戰，日本對　施　新政策以來，中日各方面加强提携協力工作，都已積極展開。上海為中日合作之中心，這種需要更加迫切，不僅是政治經濟，尤其是文化方面，怎樣　清英美思想的毒素，促進中日人民的親　，團結協力戰爭，更為非常重要的主題。本分會為了適應這種新的環境的需要，也有從　　相的必要。</p>
<p>因為上述各種原因，所以總會決定將本分會加以改組，並派兄弟担任改組籌備委員會委　長的責任，同時派定幾位委員，中國方面有　化人。林炯庵。梁秀子，日本方面中田豊千代上野太忠林宏吉等六位委員，協助　備，經過好幾次的籌備會議，縝密研究決定改組方針，徵求雙方的文化界藝術界同人加入本會，共同負責。直至今日，各種準備手續已經完成，才召集這次改組成立大會。此次改組在僚備期間，蒙中日雙方的與論界文化界關切，至為可感。今日復承友邦各幾關長官及各界來　蒞臨指導，兄弟　覺非常榮幸，非常感謝。還有逹地各團體悉賜祝詞實電，尤為銘感。本分會改組之後，集合中日雙方的文化力量，共謀上海文化的發展，及中日文化的交流，以期展開東亞新文化運動以後，仍請各位先生不　指敎</p>
<p>褚部長詞</p>
<p>旋由部會理事長褚部長代表致詞云：上海分會於南京部會成立不久，即行成立，經故李理事長及諸位同人熟心努力，過去成績昭然可觀，現因上海租界收回，環境改變，實行改組，本人深望今後上海分會在陳理事長領導之下，一本此次改組精神方針遇進，順應時代使命，益圖事業發展，俾得早速達到中日兩國文化交流眞正目的。將來會務蒸蒸日上，發展交流中日兩國舊有文化，及創造東亞新文化，而為全國文化事業革新楷模，必能操左券而可拭目以待。今當改組　成立大會開會，特謹以數言為預祝，並　陳理事長及諸位同人健康努力。中日文化協會南京總會理事長褚民誼。繼為來資致詞，</p>
<p>田尻公使辭</p>
<p>「今天中日文協上海分會改組成立，開始新出發，這是一件可喜中欣之事，尤其在陳市長指導之下，對今後中日文化之交流上，一定有很大協助，今天有此雙重意義，所以吾　之可喜可欣。中日兩國人民本來在思想文化上相同之處甚多過去如中日兩國很認眞地研究相互理解起來，則恐過去二國之誤會，就不會發生的。　諸以往的歷史，是很痛心的，但自中日文化協會改組後，把中日兩國之誤會成見來消滅，來研究，則中日兩國前途一定具有極大之希望。値此可悲痛之職事仍繼續着悲劇的演進之時代，中日文協改組了預料今後此種事實就可永遠不再發生了文化協會本來是一種文化的團體，不是政治經濟的團體，是否能發展，對政治經濟之影響很大，如文化能建樹良好的成績，則政治經濟也能入於良好的境地，這是本人所深信的。　才本人所說看來中日文協會後之使命是重而且大，吾希望中日文協在改組成立由陳市長領導之下，將中日文協恢復起來，這是本人所希望的。謹以之國致辭」。遂由林炯庵宣讀</p>

<p>大會宣言</p>
<p>溯自民國三十年一月，本分會在滬創立，瞬經兩載，兩年之間，舉凡促進中日兩大國家文化交流思想融會，　有所　　於東亞之永久和平與幸福者，本會差幸在政府領導及總會監督之下，莫不略盡棉薄，奠定初基。竊維思想為一切政治理念之根源，而文化尤為發展各種事業之原動力，苟欲中日兩國人民眞誠瞭解親善合作，非先致力於文化不為功能堅定兩國人民之意志，融洽兩國人民之感情，齊心協力，共同邁進於東亞民族解放運動之奮鬥。本年一月九日，國民政府參戰，在政治上兩大國家固已　密提携，同生共死，而文化上自亦應以此為契機，進求更深一層之合作溝通。際茲本分會改組，為確立今後努力目標衣工作動向起見，謹以　　為我文化界人士告：</p>
<p>其一，曰樹立東亞本　文化體系，文化為活動生長之有機體，歲時遷移，日新月異，固不乏新陳代謝之轉　，而地域交通，截長補短，亦時　　　攻錯之影響，故文化本無間東西，　羅並　，擇善而從，惟以適應國情及時代精神　為主。吾國歷史悠久，文化深遠，在思想上自成獨立之體系，淸季以遷，外力　　，時勢變遷，吸取西洋文明，形成時　，既震於兵堅砲利之强，又炫於自由享樂之異，未加洞鍳，僅襲皮毛，流弊所及，遂致破壞舊有社會道德制度，衍成三十年來思想界空前之钜變，而個人主義共產主義渣滓之　　，更致國家社會於紛紜紊亂，復受英美侵略惡勢力北　　離間，遂陷中日兩國人民於過去相殘相　之悲劇。上海為全國文化中心，事變之後，　　未復教育事業既形　　，靑年流離顛沛，而文化出版各方面，亦因物資困　，人才缺乏，一蹶不振，吾人痛定思痛，惟有步武友邦日本明治維新之精神，不辭艱辛，重謀樹立東亞本位文化之體系，在殘破瓦礫中，重整文化事業，而以實踐中日合作，　　　亞之目標為已任。　人所提倡之東亞本位文化，並不　　四方文化應有其確立不移之特殊性，並不否定四洋文化這存在，惟當慎重研究，根據時代精神，擷其精華，使與我固有文化治成一　，俾能成為我國文化之新機體，與我東方固有之道義精神及往聖先哲所崇信篤行之忠孝仁愛信義和平之理念相融契，而將有所貢獻於世界人類永久之幸福。基於此種信念，吾人臨此艱局，於確立東亞本位文化體系之外，更應協力於解放東亞民族之大東亞戰爭，　除不良英美思想潛伏於國家社會民衆心理之惡影響，努力發揚東方道義精神之根本信仰興決心。</p>
<p>其二，曰實踐政府戰時文化政策，自國府參戰，友邦日本推行對華新政策之後，我國文化界同志已徹底覺悟緊密團結，誓在政府領導之下，就文化人本位積極努力，策動有處於國策之文化政策。本年六月，國防最高會議通過戰時文化宣傳綱領，非惟對戰時文化事業統　　　，力謀所以發展與復興之道，即　於全國文化人本身，亦極　督促鼓動　　之至意，惟推行國策，固有　於上行下效，　舉目張，而協力此千載一時之東亞民族自求解放之戰爭，尤非努力　　參戰之決意，在各方面興友邦日本及東亞諸盟邦切實提携，不足以　　推動思想戰文化戰之功效。文化既為一切社會事業之核心，而舉凡文化諸重要部門，如學術出版藝術文學音樂戲劇電影等，又無一而非戰時宣傳不可缺乏之利器，本會既在全國文化中心之上海復改組成立於友邦交還租借百廢待舉之今日，則團結兩國文化界同志，實踐政府戰時文化政策，竭盡智力，不尙虛泛，務以文化事業活動為協力載爭爭取勝利之積極表現，實屬責無旁貸，看人亦惟有本此主張，整飭陣容，努力　　，協力推進，務期能使上海文化界，　本會之努力而益增其為全國文化之楷模。而政府領導之苦心孤詣，東亞戰爭之勝利信念，更能深入社會民衆，認識明瞭，使中日合作之燦爛前途，確立鞏固不拔之基礎。</p>
<p>本會改組伊始，會務推助，諸待興華，雖責任艱钜，然了此時會，不敢不勉，深　邦人君子，時加指導，俾得　　共勵，完途使命，　此宣言。</p>

<h3 id="c47">强化統制制度以來 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>自有戰事以來，　界上參戰國家賣施統制經濟最為有力者，當推友邦日本。日本以三島的國家，能夠控制太平洋　面積的戰爭，在經濟上，斷然地是得力於它的嚴厲統制政策；即在德國·意大利·蘇聯以及英美。亦無不　行嚴格的統制制度。統制制度愈堅化，愈　底，斯戰時物價愈平衡，民生愈　定，這乃是一個正比例。</p>
<p>觀最近一個時期上海經濟狀態之好轉——投機者之銷聲匿跡，屯　者之脫貨求現，物價之　趨平　，　　之漸見鬆弛，游貿之漸有歸宿——足使我們感覺到强化統制制度以來所已獲制之效果。證以當前的種種事實，例如查封四十一家登記不符之紗布廠商，糧統會本週起實施收買米糧，肥皂火柴配給在即，計口授鹽之考慮，各業物價之合理　弊，可知當局對於强化統制制度之決心，實有與日俱增之勢。</p>
<p>强化統制制度以後的同　，便在於統制經濟下任民應有的覺悟，其要處：得為歸納如下：　絕對　從國家統制的法令，　打倒妨碍統制制度的行為，　參加各種增加生產的運動，　　除滿足自己慾望的額念，　人人抱着「有飯大家吃」的思想，尤其要全國上下，執行統制者，慎毋假公濟私，被執行統制者，慎毋行險僥倖，如是而後執行統制與被執行統制者，都不會受到國家法律上的制裁了。</p>

<p>全國商業統制總會為重新辦理棉花統一蒐買工作起見，決定解散棉業專業委員會，另設棉花部以主其事。查今年新棉已屆收成時期，如今長一二個月內氣候正常，則前途</p>
<p>可望樂觀</p>
<p>惟據棉業中權威人士所表示之意見，原棉產區以揚子江北　帶為主，去年因原棉價格被軍方限制過低，故農民不願耕種，　至將棉田改種　　較高之雜糧等，是以棉田面積減少，此種現象直至今年未見改善，故棉田面積仍視以往為小，欲求在較小之面積上求與以往相同或超越以往之收成自非在技術方面</p>
<p>特別改良</p>
<p>不可。　制當局有鑒於此，在今年已在改進樞棉技術有所致力。同時為謀打破棉田減少之既成事實起見，頗有意將過去所訂收買價格，酌予調整，使農民樂予植棉。並樂予將產棉出售，由　可知調整棉花收買價格，為</p>

<p>糧食問題意見　—特輯之四—</p>
<h3 id="c54">對於糧食的希望 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— 張靜白</p>
<p>在戰爭的時候，政府對於人民的衣食日用必需品，加以統制配給，不許商人自由　斷，原是好辦法。可是我國的有幾　統制配給，很難　人　意　尤　是糧食方問，更為一般民衆所詬病。這並不是統制配制度的理論問題，實在是辦理糧政的技術方機尙未完善周密的緣故。茲就個人所感覺到的幾點寫出來。供獻給糧政當局。</p>
<p>一事言面，糧食的　運專員，不是糧食業的門外漢所能勝任愉怏的。糧會當局宜向糧食　中聘　　心妥善的人員辦理。　於其他的事務文書和出納等人員，最好公開招考新人。一方面表明公開辦事，避免包辦的嫌疑。一方面可收互相監督的效果，减少勾　作弊的機會。糧會方面，應將　心應聘的和何用的各級工作人員的姓名，職務，工作情形等，隨時製表公佈。使　民衆們知道那幾位是眞　　性精神，　　　們民衆服務。如果再有作弊的情　，亦應公佈眞　和參與　的姓名。不可含糊了事，誘　後人的效尤。在對外工作的塲所，最好仿順　政鐵路等窗口服務　法。將　　者的姓名。　　標出。那　値勤者倘然有什麼越　的事情，大家便可指名檢舉，公開澈查。我想糧會當局舉能照眞實行，那來服務的人，一定不敢也作弊了。</p>
<p>經費方面　　會的經費，大極可分三種。就是薪津費，事務費，搬運費。我以為薪津一項，　要使工作人員能夠安定生活，纔能努力工作。不可聽任工作人員感受到生活的威脅，以致引起　私舞弊和工作懈退的事情。希望糧會當局，　時保　工作人員的生活，事先消滅這種不良行為的萌念，纔是賢明的措置。至於事務費和搬運費，務必設法力求减低，可省則省，不可浪費分文。</p>
<p>糧價方面　目前糧食的官債和市價有很大的參差，尤其在都市裏而，甚至要相差三倍左右。一殷人都說官價的確太低了，和市價離得太還，收　時格外發生困難。這理由其實不充分的，原來物資的統制配給制度，是要使物價不許漲。目前的情形，是一般的物價均較糧食官價　得更高，　者的　思，以後不要再將糧價拉高，以致刺激物價，因果循　，應該將一般的物價壓低，纔為會理。關於壓低一般物價，糧會是沒有這種權力的，　　暫時不去談他。在一般物價沒有壓低以前，為便利糧食的收買起見，不妨由政　指　業經收買的和充公的　續物　，交給　會　　輟食　區。按照收得糧　的　景，廉價交換配　。既可使農民獲　廉價的必　品又可使一般物價迅　　低，便是一舉兩得的辦法。</p>
<p>採運方面　過夫官價　食的採購，許多地方每行按畝攤派制，由縣，區鎭，鄕，而保甲，着令田戶按畝交糧收價。因此一般食口多而耕田少的貧農，不得不把僅我預　自用的糧食交出。擁有天產子百畝的富豪，因攤派欲的餘糧尙多，反可以把餘糧昂價售出。這種辦法，額然是不合理的。希望糧會以後最好不用攤派制，否則應該計算田戶的　畝數，先照戶口人數，扣除留存自用　食，倘有剩糧，再行收買。那末富有者不妨　買其多餘的，不足者當然可以　免了。運輸方面，當然求取速。費少，便利幾點。此外應該另　採運證　正副二紙，縝明該批糧食類別，採購數量。發運數量，包駮　誌，發運地點，到　地點等項，由發運地點　當公　證明。除正張由押運人員隨帶備查外，副張即由證明公　　行郵寄　　地點的公署或是糧食，以備對照。那宋在運餘的路上，不敢發弊端了。</p>
<p>數　方面　糧會採運的糧食，除了軍級等以外其他的是拿來配給都市居民和沒有糧食收　的人民的。過去因為糧種的關係，配給的數量，委實太少了些，居民為了需要的迫切，不得不求之黑市。以致黑市　狂，統制配給的止標，幾乎沒有在的地位。希望以後配給數量，能夠逐漸增加，大概每人每月以一年五升為度，否則黑市是不會消減的。</p>
<p>方面　現在民衆購買配給糧食的辦法，除了少數食物讓和機關　是向糧會原包購買以外，其餘多數民衆是向糧食特約零　處購買的。因為特約零售處數目極多和散漫的關係，糧會無法隨地監督，以致往往發生尅扣衡量。掉換劣來，攙入雜竹等弊羰。希望糧會以後設法廢止特約零售處，自設零售處，者市中按每一個保甲區設立一處。那末監督起來。自可周密了。或者將特約零售處歸减少，以二　聯保設立一處為標凖，也可以减省開支，便利監督。對於衡　方面，務要稱平斗滿，不許　斜觀底。淺方小升，因將姆指　在表面，更共容易作弊，不可多用。倘然自設零俾外，那末因為零星衡量而發生的　餘或短少的　數，應該由監督人證明　告糧會。這樣一來　尅扣的事情，當可减少了。糧食每斯配給幾種糧食的時候，應當確切指明一定的種類，品質，數量等項，不要含混地只說或什麼或什麼。倘然本斯有弊次的糧食，而不是各處一律出售的。那末可以指　某號至某號的一組零售　，出售較次糧食，下期輪流交換。那末這個「或」字，可以不再需用。對於掉換和攙入的弊端，一定可以减少了。</p>
<p>古人說：「國以民為本，民以食為天」。糧食問題，尤其是戰時的糧食問題，的確是一件不得易辦好而不可不辦好的要政。牠的困難，是在景響國計民生的鉅大性和容易發生弊端。賢明的糧政當局，為了國家，為了民衆，一定能夠奮　苦幹，不撓不屈，克復這困難的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Congratulating the Reorganization and Establishment of the Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The reorganization of the Shanghai branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association has been completed, and the inaugural meeting was held yesterday afternoon. Recalling the first inaugural meeting on January 29th, 1930, its declaration proclaimed two points: first, to seek the integration and understanding of the cultures of the two countries; and second, to aspire to the creation of Eastern culture. It further explained that concerning the integration and understanding of the cultures of the two countries, each should take the other's strengths and weaknesses as the basis for selection and rejection, borrowing from each other's advantages to make up for their own deficiencies, extracting the essence and discarding the dross, completing what is incomplete, innovating what is outdated, and promoting and developing the inherent culture, which is an urgent task, while integrating and absorbing foreign cultures is also an important plan. If so, the cooperation between Chinese and Japanese cultures can help each other and complement each other. Concerning the aspiration to create Eastern culture, the Chinese nation has a history of five thousand years, dating back to the times of Emperors Yao and Shun, with remarkable cultural artifacts and institutions. Japan has been established for three thousand years, and although it was nurtured by Chinese culture in its early stages, it has made significant achievements in both spiritual and material aspects since accepting Western science in modern times. Since China and Japan have established close ties in culture, each contributing its strengths, it is not difficult to establish a system of Eastern culture.</p>
<p>The declaration of this reorganization and establishment of the association also proclaims two points: one is to establish an East Asian-centered cultural system, and the other is to implement the government's wartime cultural policies. Looking at the main points of the two declarations, one might say that they both focus on cultural exchange, and only through cultural exchange between the two countries can an East Asian-centered cultural system be established.</p>
<p>From the first establishment of the association to the present, more than two and a half years have passed. In this not-too-short process, a practical review of the association's work achievements shows that, in terms of Sino-Japanese cultural exchange, frankly speaking, it has not achieved the ideal results. It is hoped that after this organizational refreshment, it can catch up and realize the purpose stipulated in the charter: "To communicate the cultures of China and Japan; to harmonize the feelings of people from all walks of life in both countries, and to promote Eastern civilization, in order to achieve the goal of good neighborliness and friendship."</p>
<p>As for practical matters, Article 3 of the association's charter has specific provisions, stipulating fourteen items for the promotion of Sino-Japanese cultural undertakings. Of course, these undertakings are all very important, and it is desirable to carry them out as much as possible. However, given the environment and funding, it may not be possible to do everything. In that case, it is necessary to consider the urgency and importance, select a few, concentrate efforts on carrying them out first, and gradually extend them to other undertakings after achieving results, so as to complete them universally. For example, the second item, "Publication of various translated works," since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, what Japanese culture has been introduced to Chinese people given the bleak state of Shanghai publications? What Chinese culture has been contributed to Japanese people? If this is used as a measure of the achievements of Sino-Japanese cultural exchange, then it is too weak to make people believe that Sino-Japanese cultural exchange is possible! Because the publishing industry as a whole has fallen into a state of stagnation, and cultural figures and writers are living in poverty, with fewer than ten books published each month, even if the publications are all related to Sino-Japanese cultural exchange, there is no question of them having an effect, let alone the fact that the publications are mostly soft. Therefore, we believe that the association's future work should focus on publishing periodicals, arousing the interest of the publishing industry and writers, working together for the publishing industry, creating a vigorous and prosperous atmosphere, and thereby establishing the foundation of cultural exchange. In addition, it should be supplemented by other cultural undertakings to comprehensively promote the mission entrusted to the association.</p>
<p>To achieve the success of the undertaking, funding and talent are indispensable. Talent cannot be obtained urgently, and cultivation and training must take a considerable amount of time. However, among the cultural figures currently residing in Shanghai, there is certainly no lack of those who can be competent and can be cultivated. If the treatment of cultural figures can be improved so that they are not threatened by life, the efficiency of cultural work will certainly be increased. Therefore, the talent problem can be solved by taking the lives of cultural figures as a prerequisite, which should lead to it. As for funding, it is difficult to do without a sufficient amount. Because of the high prices, labor costs increase accordingly, and paper and printing require a lot of money. Moreover, a great and far-reaching publishing plan requires the storage of materials to adapt to the plan, so that it can be continuously supplied without being exhausted. Therefore, with regard to funding, in any case, one should take a long-term view and try to raise enough money. Since both China and Japan recognize the importance of cultural exchange, the funds needed to achieve the task should not be a problem; otherwise, empty talk of exchange will never have any real effect.</p>
<p>Finally, we know that Shanghai is the center of Chinese culture and the region that is most accessible to Japan in terms of culture. It is of course most appropriate to take the lead in promoting Sino-Japanese cultural exchange from Shanghai and establish a foundation. And what is fortunate is that the chairman of the association, who is also the highest responsible person of the association, is Mayor Chen, and the responsible cadres are all well-known figures in the Chinese and Japanese cultural circles. As the association's chairman Chen said in his opening speech: "In the past, most of the members were from the economic or public service sectors, and there were fewer people who were actually in charge of specific responsibilities, which made it quite difficult to promote the work of this branch." Therefore, we further hope that Chairman Chen and other leaders will actively assume specific responsibilities in the future and eliminate the difficulties of the past. After a considerable period of time, we are willing to wait and see the achievements of the association's work, which are the achievements of Sino-Japanese cultural exchange and the achievements of close relations between Chinese and Japanese officials and people.</p>

<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - The German government held the 1943 Harvest Thanksgiving Festival at the Führer's residence on the morning of the 3rd. Minister Backe, representing Führer Hitler, awarded the First Class Cross of Merit to 188 farmers. At the event, Backe stated that the High Command was extremely satisfied with the 1943 agricultural results, stating: This year's harvest is of great importance in determining the outcome of this existential war. This year's harvest situation not only set a new record since the beginning of the war, but will also exceed the normal annual harvest. The cultivated area has decreased somewhat compared to peacetime, but has increased by one-third compared to last year. The wheat harvest this year is 4.2 million tons, compared to 2.3 million tons in 1918, an increase of 82%. The fodder harvest also exceeded the planned target. The potato harvest is 2 million tons more than in 1918, and 1.5 million tons more than in 1915. The sugar beet harvest is abundant, not only providing the sugar needed by the German people, but also providing raw materials for military factories and feed for livestock.</p>
<p>Expressing Gratitude to Farmers on Behalf</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - German Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels delivered a speech at a mass rally in the Berlin Sports Palace on Sunday on the occasion of the Autumn Thanksgiving Festival. He reiterated the unwavering unity of the German nation and its strong determination to strive for ultimate victory, and expressed gratitude to all German farmers on behalf of the German Führer. Goebbels declared: The German Führer is currently leading the war for the survival and future of the German nation, and is unable to attend in person as he normally would. Goebbels pointed out, "At the beginning of the fifth year of this war, Germany has been able to increase its bread ration, which is almost a miracle, and is largely due to the diligence and efficiency of German farmers." Goebbels solemnly declared, "Bread and weapons are the prerequisites for waging war. The German armaments industry, after being expanded and reformed by Armaments Minister Speer, has greatly increased its production." Goebbels then expressed gratitude on behalf of the Führer and the German nation to the millions of German men and women armaments workers. Goebbels solemnly declared, "The German people, especially in areas subject to enemy terror bombings, have suffered greatly, which the Führer knows best. It would be a great mistake for the enemy to regard the cowardice of a few individuals as a demonstration against the war in Germany. In National Socialist Germany, anti-war sentiment is absolutely non-existent. If London and Washington dream that the story of the Italian Badoglio government of July 25 can happen in Germany, it is a ridiculous hope. This hope is based entirely on an absolutely erroneous understanding of the internal situation and the will and determination of the German people." Goebbels stated: First, the leader of Germany is the German Führer, not a rebellious king. Germany is a republic, not an authoritarian state. Second, in the German armed forces, there is not a single soldier who fears death and clings to life. Third, after the painful experience of November 1918, the German people will never again be deceived by the enemy."</p>
<p>Discussing the Acute Problems of the War Situation</p>
<p>In his speech, Goebbels also discussed several acute problems of the current war situation. Regarding the air war, he declared: Although the enemy's terror bombings have been slightly relaxed in the past few weeks, we must expect them to return in the future. Some air raids have not been carried out due to weather conditions, as the weather does not allow large-scale flights by air force units, and also hinders German defenses. On the other hand, there is no doubt that Germany's military defenses have recently been greatly strengthened and improved. Therefore, the enemy has been paying a heavy price for this. The Allied newspapers have publicly admitted this without hesitation. The enemy's losses are increasing day by day, and will continue to increase in the future." Goebbels continued, "The air war is in many ways a scientific war between Germany and the Allied powers. German science is currently making rapid progress. In the future, the enemy will suffer great losses in both manpower and material resources. The enemy's success will no longer be directly proportional to the manpower and resources they use. At that time, the enemy's so-called 'flying fortresses' will become 'flying coffins'." Goebbels added, "There is no doubt that the air war has caused Germany many difficulties, but the areas where the air war has occurred are completely different from what the enemy hoped for. In any case, Germany's arms production will not be harmed by the enemy's attacks. The smooth progress of the war will not be seriously affected by the enemy's air raids." Regarding the measures taken against enemy terror bombings, Goebbels solemnly declared: German civil air defense has been greatly strengthened, and it is expected that the people will be better able to control the situation from now on. Goebbels mentioned the measures taken to relocate people from major German cities, and pointed out that as a result of these steps, only two children were killed in the recent British air raid on Berlin. Regarding retaliation, Goebbels declared: "It would be a serious mistake for the British to think that German retaliation is merely empty talk without any factual manifestation. There will come a day when Britain will encounter practical experience. German inventors, technicians, engineers, and workers will pay attention to ensuring that British and American trees cannot grow in the sky." Goebbels boldly stated, "It would also be a mistake for Britain and the United States to think that the danger of German submarines has been overcome. German engineering has not abandoned submarine warfare."</p>
<p>Capable of Controlling the Eastern Front Situation</p>
<p>Regarding the war on the Eastern Front, Goebbels stated: "The German army has sufficient strength to keep the war-mongering Bolsheviks far away from German borders. The German army has been conducting detachment operations in recent weeks. The enemy will soon understand the meaning of these operations. The vast area occupied by the German army on the Eastern Front in the past two years allows the German army to conduct mobile warfare without harming the chances of German victory. The German people can calmly observe the development of the Eastern Front. If the east of Europe is not given a clear solution, it will always be a danger to Germany. As for the problem of Bolshevism, there is no need to waste words. Although the danger of Bolshevism is not publicly acknowledged everywhere, it is fully understood. We hope that the neutral countries and the enemies in the West will observe these problems more clearly and realistically than they did when the German army was fighting on the Volga." Regarding this point, Goebbels stated: He made these remarks not to ask for anyone's understanding or help. The Germans feel capable of controlling the situation themselves, but the smaller neutral countries should show understanding to Germany and not criticize the actions of its troops.</p>
<p>Surrender Midway Will Inevitably Fail</p>
<p>Regarding the situation in Italy, Goebbels stated: "The situation in Italy has suffered serious difficulties due to the rebellion of Badoglio and the Italian King. This group of rebels willingly handed over the German troops fighting in southern Italy to the enemy as the price of entering the enemy camp. This shameful intention has been overcome by our political and military measures. The rescue of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has politically become a symbol of the establishment of a Republican Fascist Italy. Militarily, the German divisions quickly resolved Badoglio's troops." Goebbels mentioned the thirteen conditions of Badoglio's surrender to Britain and the United States, stating: "The fate of Italy proves that no one can avoid war by deceptive means. This war is like a high-speed express train. Anyone who tries to jump off will break their neck. Anyone who lays down their weapons midway will inevitably fail. This war is not a war for concepts or regimes, nor is it a war for individuals or opinions, but a war for the nation and its rights to its future life and the possibility of survival. There is no choice between war and peace. All there is is either victory or elimination." After briefly describing the various phases of the Italian events, Goebbels added: "The British and American advance towards Rome and Munich has not been realized. The enemy is still on the southern Italian mainland and is complaining about the strong German defenses. After the battles of Bigny and Dunkirk, it is the first time that the British and American forces have felt the strong German resistance on European territory. The British and American forces will have many more opportunities to recognize the defensive power of the German army."</p>
<p>This Great War Is a Historical Drama</p>
<p>Regarding the intention of Britain and the United States to invade Europe from the west, Goebbels declared: "Germany and the Soviet Union have been waiting for the British and American invasion of Europe, but have not seen it realized. The enemy obviously thought that the Italian method was easier. But the British and American forces have only been fighting on the periphery of Europe so far, and have not yet touched the core of the German defenses. The German army has prepared many surprises to await the arrival of the British and American forces. This war is the greatest drama in the history of our country or even the history of the world. The possibility of a definite solution to the European problem has now begun to emerge. National Socialist Germany will know how to take advantage of this opportunity, and the German Führer is the model for this."</p>
<h3 id="e31">Introduction: The European War and the Balkan Countries (Part 1) <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The withdrawal of the Axis forces from Tunisia, the landing of the Allied forces in Sicily, and the surrender of the Badoglio regime in Italy - due to these three leaps in the Mediterranean situation, the Balkan countries have once again attracted worldwide attention. The German-Soviet alliance, the deadly battle between Germany and Britain, the Italian-Greek war, the German troops stationed in the Balkans, the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, and the current withdrawal of Italy, in these four years of European turmoil, except for Turkey, the other Balkan countries have all gathered under the sphere of German influence until today.</p>
<p>Since Britain and the United States occupied Sicily, they have temporarily regained naval control of the Mediterranean. Under this operational stance, and in the face of unexpected setbacks in relations with the Soviet Union in this political situation, the conference held by Roosevelt and Churchill in Quebec only issued a very low-key joint statement, saying that they were discussing operations in East Asia, and closed without a sound.</p>
<p>But the whole world cannot be deceived by this kind of propaganda. The real agenda of the Quebec talks was the attitude of Britain and the United States towards the Soviet Union, and the discussion of a second European front, which is not difficult to imagine. At this time, the whole world also knows that the so-called second front will be opened by Britain and the United States. In the current situation where they have won in Sicily, it is by no means easy to achieve in terms of operations, let alone adding the Soviet Union problem, which adds another layer of difficulty in political terms.</p>
<p>Before a "second front" that can truly break through this difficulty is successfully opened, not to mention the desire to open up relations with the Soviet Union, even the opportunity to achieve victory in Europe is hopeless for Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>The Situation in the Balkans</p>
<p>Before the surrender of the Badoglio regime, neutral sources said that the British and Americans would land in the Balkans, some said they would land in southern France, and some said they would land on the Italian peninsula, and some even said they would land in northern Europe. The rumors are mixed and there is no consensus. In short, they are all centered on this second front. Therefore, if we examine why Britain and the United States attacked Tunisia and why they landed in Sicily, this is nothing more than Britain and the United States exploring the entrance to the second front. And the most likely possibility seems to be to depart from Sicily and land in southern Italy, which is separated by a narrow strip of water, or in part of Albania, to invade the Balkans. Or, using naval control of the Mediterranean, recapture Crete Island and invade the Dodecanese Islands to establish a bridgehead for attacking the Balkans in Greece.</p>
<p>The value of the Romanian oil fields and the Iron Gate of the Danube River has made Britain and the United States covet Germany's hegemony. They believe that this can only be done after reaching a temporary compromise with the Soviet Union and agreeing on it.</p>
<p>In this sense, Badoglio's declaration of a ceasefire not only to Britain and the United States, but also to the Soviet Union, has a profound meaning. Before the announcement of the surrender, the Soviet Union openly expressed its participation in the Mediterranean operations. In fact, the surrender of Italy is by no means only the power of Britain and the United States, but also the pressure of the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front. Therefore, this shows that the Soviet Union is as concerned about the Mediterranean as Britain and the United States. The Moscow broadcast on the night of the 4th said: As the Soviet Union is at war with Germany and Italy, it will naturally participate in the North Italian operations, and as a major European power, it cannot be indifferent to the Mediterranean problems. The Soviet Union sent representatives to the Free French Committee in North Africa and began diplomatic relations with Egypt. The anti-Axis Mediterranean Committee organized by representatives of the United States and Britain recognized the participation of Soviet representatives. These matters are the result of the above-mentioned compromise between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. At the Quebec talks, it can also be seen that the two giants of Britain and the United States decided on this kind of concession to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>This advance of the Soviet Union into the Mediterranean naturally also means the increase of the Soviet Union's influence over the Balkan Peninsula. Regarding the Balkan operations, some degree of compromise may have been reached between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>If Britain and the United States reach this compromise with the Soviet Union, then the most troublesome thing is probably Turkey! Recently, the efforts of Britain and the United States to pull Turkey over have become increasingly blatant. Because of the recent statement by Turkish Prime Minister Saracoğlu: "The Turkish government does not believe that its relationship with Britain and the United States is purely neutral," the anti-Axis front has been propagating that Turkey is approaching Britain and the United States, but even if this is indeed a sign that Turkey is changing its traditional neutral policy to a non-belligerent policy, it has not been very smooth in practice when looking back at its relationship with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Turkey's approach to Britain and the United States has indeed become more obvious recently, but on the other hand, the shadow of Soviet-Turkish relations, which cannot be ignored, is also deepening day by day. This inconsistency between Britain and the United States has preserved Turkey's neutrality. Now, if Britain and the United States make concessions to the Soviet Union, Turkey is breaking out in a cold sweat!</p>
<p>Britain and the United States' Psychological Warfare</p>
<p>Leaving aside the military offensive against the Balkans for the time being, the psychological warfare of Britain and the United States is currently reaching its climax in the Balkans. Providing aid to anti-German terrorist groups in the former Yugoslavia area, propaganda to the Greek people centered on the withdrawal of the Italian garrison to their home country, etc., all kinds of propaganda techniques are being used, and the so-called "diplomatic offensive" of Britain and the United States is probably being carried out most intensely in Bulgaria!</p>
<p>Although there is no wavering in the policy of cooperation with Germany in Bulgaria, the Bulgarian people feel very close to the Soviet Union in terms of nationality. This is the reason why Bulgaria is the only country in Europe and the Balkans that has maintained neutrality in the German-Soviet war. Britain and the United States are using exiled Bulgarians to broadcast propaganda three times a day, and although the late King Boris's return from a visit to Germany was on August 15, two weeks before his death, they are also maliciously propagating that the king was murdered.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is rumored that British aircraft have recently been appearing frequently in Bulgarian airspace, dropping leaflets. It cannot be hastily determined whether Britain and the United States will indeed land in the Balkans. But their psychological warfare against the Balkans is indeed becoming more and more intense as the European war deepens.

<p>Since the Buddhist Association and groups in this city responded to the call to provide disaster relief to North China and collect donations, the matters have progressed quite smoothly. This time, the heads of various temples have made individual donations amounting to a considerable sum, which is said to be close to the set target. In order to handle the closing, the Buddhist Association held a regular meeting yesterday and resolved to promptly settle the donations and announce them in the near future to demonstrate credibility. It is also heard that all the expenses required for soliciting donations this time will be borne by the Buddhist Association, and the donated funds will be used entirely for disaster relief.</p>

Director Chen, Advisor Dao, and Section Chief Lu personally presided over the talks, and conducted detailed and thorough discussions on price regulation issues. It was resolved that vegetables are more important than meat, so the vegetable issue would be handled first. The prices of vegetables in various vegetable markets will be determined according to the appropriate prices determined within the scope of prices evaluated by the Central Market, and will be published on a daily basis in the vegetable markets. Vegetable vendors must not arbitrarily raise prices in order to avoid illegal extra profits. The measures are being drafted, and once they are ready, they can be implemented.</p>

<h3 id="e36">The Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Held a Reorganization and Inauguration Ceremony Yesterday, Attended by Mayor Chen and Minister Lin <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch: The Shanghai branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, in order to regroup various cultural organizations in Shanghai, launch more vigorous cultural activities, realize the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty, and form the core of Sino-Japanese cultural cooperation, held a reorganization and inauguration meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday on the eighth floor of a hotel. Mayor Chen, in his capacity as chairman of the preparatory committee, personally presided over the meeting. Minister Lin and Minister's Envoy attended to provide guidance. Minister Chu, Director-General of the Nanjing General Association of the Association, specially sent Envoy Zhang Chao as a representative. More than 500 guests, including heads of Sino-Japanese institutions and celebrities from all walks of life, as well as all members of the association, gathered together in an unprecedentedly grand occasion. The ceremony was simple and solemn. Upon hearing the music, the city government music team played the national anthems of China and Japan. After the salutation, Mayor Chen, as chairman, delivered a speech:</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, the Shanghai branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association has been established for two years. In the past two years, thanks to the joint efforts of China and Japan, it has achieved good results. However, the term of the previous board of directors has expired and should be reorganized according to regulations. This is one reason for the reorganization of this branch. Secondly, when this branch was established, people from all walks of life enthusiastically joined, but most of the members were from the economic and public sectors, and there were fewer people actually responsible for specific tasks, making it difficult to promote the cause of this branch. This is the second reason for the reorganization of this association. Furthermore, after the unification of the Shanghai municipal administration, the term "concession" has disappeared, but the Anglo-American ideas nurtured in the concessions still exist. To transform this kind of thinking, we must start from the cultural aspect. This is the third reason for the reorganization of this branch. Since the National Government entered the war and Japan implemented a new policy towards China, various aspects of Sino-Japanese cooperation have been actively launched. Shanghai is the center of Sino-Japanese cooperation, and this need is even more urgent. Not only in politics and economy, but especially in culture, how to eliminate the poison of Anglo-American thought, promote the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people, and unite and cooperate in the war is a very important theme. This branch also needs to be adapted to the needs of this new environment.</p>
<p>For the above reasons, the General Association decided to reorganize this branch and appointed me to be responsible for the chairman of the reorganization preparatory committee. At the same time, several committee members were appointed, including Chinese scholars Lin Jiongan and Liang Xiu Zi, and Japanese committee members Nakata Toyochiyo, Ueno Taichu, and Hayashi Hirokichi, to assist in the preparation. After several preparatory meetings, we carefully studied and decided on the reorganization policy, and sought the participation of cultural and artistic colleagues from both sides to jointly take responsibility. Until today, various preparations have been completed, and this reorganization and inauguration meeting has been convened. During the preparatory period of this reorganization, we were deeply grateful for the concern of the media and cultural circles of China and Japan. Today, we are honored and grateful to have the heads of various agencies and guests from friendly countries come to guide us. We are also deeply grateful for the congratulatory messages and telegrams sent by various organizations. After the reorganization of this branch, it will gather the cultural forces of China and Japan to jointly promote the development of Shanghai's culture and Sino-Japanese cultural exchanges, in order to launch a new East Asian cultural movement. We still ask for your guidance.</p>
<p>Minister Chu's Speech</p>
<p>Then, Minister Chu, Director-General of the Association, delivered a speech on behalf of the ministry: The Shanghai branch was established shortly after the Nanjing ministry was established. Thanks to the efforts of the late Director Li and colleagues, the past achievements have been evident. Now, due to the recovery of the Shanghai concessions and changes in the environment, a reorganization is being implemented. I sincerely hope that under the leadership of Director Chen, the Shanghai branch will continue to promote the spirit and policies of this reorganization, meet the mission of the times, and further develop its cause, so as to achieve the true goal of cultural exchange between China and Japan as soon as possible. In the future, the association's affairs will flourish, develop and exchange the old cultures of China and Japan, and create a new East Asian culture, becoming a model for the innovation of national cultural undertakings. We can surely hold the winning ticket and wait and see. Today, as the reorganization and inauguration meeting is held, I would like to offer a few words as a congratulatory message, and wish Director Chen and all colleagues health and hard work. Chu Minyi, Director-General of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Nanjing General Association. This was followed by speeches from guests,</p>
<p>Envoy Tajiri's Speech</p>
<p>"Today, the reorganization and establishment of the Shanghai branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association marks a new beginning, which is a happy and joyful event. Especially under the guidance of Mayor Chen, it will definitely greatly assist the future exchange of Sino-Japanese culture. Today has this dual significance, so we are happy and joyful. The people of China and Japan originally have many similarities in thought and culture. If China and Japan seriously study and understand each other, then the misunderstandings of the past two countries would not have occurred. Looking back on the past history is very painful, but since the reorganization of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, we will eliminate and study the misunderstandings and prejudices between China and Japan. Then the future of China and Japan will definitely have great hope. At a time when the tragic events of the past continue to unfold, the reorganization of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association is expected to prevent such events from ever happening again. The Cultural Association is originally a cultural group, not a political or economic group, but whether it can develop has a great impact on politics and economy. If culture can achieve good results, then politics and economy can also enter a good state, which is what I deeply believe. It seems that the mission of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association is heavy and great. I hope that the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association will be restored under the leadership of Mayor Chen after the reorganization. This is what I hope for. I offer my congratulations." Then Lin Jiongan read</p>
<p>Congratulatory Telegrams from Various Parties</p>
<p>A congratulatory telegram from the North China New People's Association said, "We are very happy to learn that your association is holding a reorganization and inauguration meeting. In the future, Sino-Japanese culture will be further developed. We send this telegram to express our congratulations. Wang Kemin, Chairman, and Yu Xijie, Vice Chairman, of the New People's Association of the Republic of China." The Zhejiang, Anhui, Guangdong, and Wuhan branches of the Cultural Association also sent telegrams to express their congratulations.</p>

<p>Declaration of the General Meeting</p>
<p>Since the establishment of this branch in Shanghai in January of the 30th year of the Republic of China, two years have passed in an instant. During these two years, this association has been fortunate to have been under the leadership of the government and the supervision of the General Association in promoting cultural exchanges and ideological integration between the two major countries of China and Japan, and in contributing to the lasting peace and happiness of East Asia. We believe that thought is the root of all political ideals, and culture is the driving force for the development of various undertakings. If we want the people of China and Japan to sincerely understand, be friendly, and cooperate, we must first devote ourselves to culture, so as to firmly establish the will of the people of the two countries, harmonize the feelings of the people of the two countries, and work together to advance the struggle for the East Asian national liberation movement. On January 9th of this year, the National Government joined the war. Politically, the two major countries have already closely cooperated, sharing life and death. Culturally, we should also take this as an opportunity to seek deeper cooperation and communication. As this branch is reorganized, in order to establish future goals and directions for our work, we hereby announce to the cultural figures:</p>
<p>First, to establish an East Asian-based cultural system. Culture is an organic body that grows and develops. With the passage of time, it changes and evolves day by day. There is no shortage of metabolism and transformation. Regional transportation, taking the best from each other, also has a constant influence. Therefore, culture has no distinction between East and West. We should be inclusive and choose the good and follow it, but we should mainly adapt to national conditions and the spirit of the times. Our country has a long history and a profound culture, forming an independent system in thought. Since the late Qing Dynasty, due to external forces and changes in the situation, we have absorbed Western civilization and formed the times. We were shocked by the strength of strong soldiers and cannons, and dazzled by the difference between freedom and enjoyment. Without careful insight, we only copied the superficial. The abuses have led to the destruction of the existing social morality and system, and developed into an unprecedented upheaval in the ideological circles of the past 30 years. The dregs of individualism and communism have further led the country and society to confusion and disorder. We have also been subjected to the evil forces of Anglo-American aggression and alienation, and have fallen into the past tragedies of mutual残 and mutual害 between the people of China and Japan. Shanghai is the cultural center of the country. After the incident, the educational undertakings have been severely damaged, the youth have been displaced, and the cultural and publishing aspects have also suffered a setback due to material difficulties and lack of talent. We are determined to learn from the spirit of the Meiji Restoration in friendly Japan, and we will not hesitate to re-establish the East Asian-based cultural system, reorganize the cultural undertakings in the ruins, and make it our responsibility to practice Sino-Japanese cooperation and contribute to the realization of East Asia's goals. The East Asian-based culture promoted by the people does not deny that the culture of all parties should have its established and unchangeable particularity, nor does it deny the existence of Western culture. However, we should carefully study it, and according to the spirit of the times, extract its essence, so that it can form a new organism of our culture with our inherent cultural governance, and be in harmony with the spirit of Eastern morality and the ideals of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace advocated and practiced by the past saints and sages. This will contribute to the lasting happiness of the world and mankind. Based on this belief, in addition to establishing the East Asian-based cultural system, we should also cooperate in the Greater East Asia War to liberate the East Asian nations, eliminate the bad influence of Anglo-American ideas lurking in the psychology of the state, society, and the people, and strive to promote the fundamental belief and determination of the Eastern moral spirit.</p>
<p>Second, to implement the government's wartime cultural policy. Since the National Government joined the war and friendly Japan implemented a new policy towards China, our cultural comrades have thoroughly realized the need to unite closely and vowed to work actively under the leadership of the government to formulate a cultural policy that is based on the interests of the country. In June of this year, the Supreme National Defense Council approved the wartime cultural propaganda program, which not only unified the wartime cultural undertakings and strived to develop and revive them, but also greatly urged and motivated the cultural figures themselves. The intention is to promote national policies, which are rooted in the top-down approach. To cooperate in this once-in-a-lifetime war for the self-liberation of the East Asian nations, we must also work hard to realize our determination to participate in the war, and cooperate effectively with friendly Japan and other East Asian allies in all aspects, in order to promote the effectiveness of the ideological and cultural wars. Culture is the core of all social undertakings, and all important departments of culture, such as academics, publishing, art, literature, music, drama, and film, are indispensable weapons for wartime propaganda. As this association is reorganized and established in Shanghai, the cultural center of the country, on this day when friendly countries have returned the concessions and everything is waiting to be done, it is our unshirkable responsibility to unite cultural comrades from both countries, implement the government's wartime cultural policy, and devote our intelligence to actively contribute to the war and strive for victory through cultural activities. The people are also determined to uphold this proposition, reorganize the ranks, and strive to cooperate and promote progress, so that Shanghai's cultural circles can become a model for national culture with the efforts of this association. The government's painstaking efforts and the belief in the victory of the East Asian War can be deeply rooted in the society and the people, so that the brilliant future of Sino-Japanese cooperation can be established on a solid foundation.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the reorganization of this association, the promotion of association affairs is still waiting to be done. Although the responsibility is arduous, we dare not fail to live up to this moment. We deeply hope that people from all walks of life will provide guidance from time to time, so that we can encourage each other and complete the mission. This is our declaration.</p>
<p>Tribute Telegram</p>
<p>Zhou Huarren respectfully read the tribute telegram to President Wang of the Nanjing National Government Executive Yuan, "Harmony is established, and the people are liberated. We look forward to the development of the country and establish the great plan of the country. We work diligently and are dedicated to the country. We admire you as the high pillar of the state and the heavy Mount Tai. Your divine plans are deeply admired. Since Shanghai recovered the concessions, its sovereignty has been firmly ensured, and the cultural thoughts have gradually been brought back to the right track. In the future, under your leadership, we will continue to encourage and strive to promote the communication of Sino-Japanese culture, so as to complete the mission of the wartime cultural system. The branch was reorganized and established on the 4th of this month. We respectfully pay our respects and wish you well. Respectfully, The Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Reorganization and Inauguration Meeting. Seal." To His Excellency Prime Minister Tojo of the Imperial Government of Japan, Tokyo, "Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the East Asian nations have been liberated, and the Shanghai concessions have been returned. China's sovereignty has been firmly ensured, and we are deeply grateful for your leadership. After the military victory, we must continue to work hard to complete the mission of the holy war, to eliminate American thoughts and build a new East Asian culture. The branch was reorganized and established on the 4th of this month. We respectfully send this telegram to express our respect and wish you well. Respectfully, The Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Reorganization and Inauguration Meeting. Seal."</p>
<p>Senior Staff</p>
<p>Afterwards, guests came in succession and entered the hall to begin a tea party. The atmosphere was warm, and the conversations were pleasant. The meeting ended at 5:00 PM. It was also learned that after the establishment of the association, the director of the secretariat and other senior staff were appointed by Director Chen as follows: Director of the Secretariat, Zhou Huarren; Participant of the Secretariat, Lin Advertisement; Director of the General Affairs Department, Gao; Director of the Experience Department, Tador Masao; Deputy, Wang Tiandu; Director of the Administrative Department, Takahashi Ryuzo; Director of the Planning Department, Liu Ersheng.</p>
<p>The Police May Not Deliberately Detain Non-Controlled Goods in Transit; Severe Penalties Will Be Imposed for Any Obstruction</p>
<p>In recent years, prices have soared, and people's livelihoods have become increasingly difficult. In order to stabilize society and people's livelihoods, all major food items have been placed under control to prevent manipulation and profiteering. Since its effective implementation, prices have stabilized, which has greatly benefited the daily lives of citizens. To alleviate the difficulties of merchants, the Municipal Government has ordered its affiliated first, second, and third police bureaus not to detain non-controlled goods. Severe penalties will be imposed for any deliberate obstruction.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Coal Ration of Shutdown Factories Transferred to Legitimate Users <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Coal Briquette Supply Situation Expected to Improve</p>
<p>Some factories in this city are currently shut down due to material problems. Yesterday, people from the coal industry told a commercial reporter that the authorities have stopped the coal ration for shutdown factories starting this month. When the factories resume operation, they can reapply for coal. The number of shutdown factories in this city is not small, so the amount of coal rations stopped each month is considerable. It is now heard that the authorities have allocated these coal rations to other legitimate users. It is now late autumn, and winter is not far away. The demand for coal will increase. Some hotels, bathhouses, and restaurants will ask the authorities to increase the amount of coal allocated. To prevent coal panic, the relevant authorities have ordered a large amount of coal from the producing areas. Some of it has already been shipped to Shanghai, and the rest is still being transported. The coal briquette supply situation in this city once showed a panic phenomenon, and various retail stores raised prices and refused to sell. The current coal briquette situation has also changed. The city has more spot goods.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Conducts Industry Surveys <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Insurance Industry Survey Completed, Now Surveying the Financial Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Chamber of Commerce has been restoring its operations for more than a year. The most important work in promoting commercial operations is the supplementary registration and re-registration of companies, the certification of assets in various industries, the issuance of membership certificates with affixed stamps, and negotiations on petitions from various industries. In addition, the guidance work includes assisting the competent authorities in organizing industrial and commercial groups, guiding the industry associations to promote association affairs, and accepting registration matters for association members and store members. It is reported that the association has handled 803 cases in one year, including 32 organizational matters, 152 guidance matters, 219 registration matters, 201 filing matters, and 195 other matters. There are a total of 151 registered associations. At the same time, the association has realized that there are many types of businesses in this city, reaching more than 200 items. In order to understand the actual operating conditions of various industries, so as to guide the transformation, it has conducted industry surveys. The insurance industry survey has been completed, and the survey of the financial industry is currently underway. In addition, it has jointly established the Industrial and Commercial Survey Institute with the Chinese Factories Association of this city to specialize in handling industrial and commercial survey statistics matters.</p>

<p>Sugar Merchants Cooperative Purchases Huge Amount of Sugar, Total Sugar Price Reaches 40 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The citywide sugar supply faced a serious threat after the war, but this threat has been largely resolved since the implementation of the sugar rationing system. Currently, all Chinese merchants are shipping large quantities of sugar from Taiwan to continue the supply and maintain the rationing system. According to a Central News Agency report, the military allocation department has purchased a large quantity of sugar, with a total value of 40 million yuan. As a result, sugar warehouses have ample reserves, and there is no concern about sugar rationing and supply.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Soap and Match Rationing Amount <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Half a piece of soap and one small package of matches per month</p>
<p>A rationing system will be implemented for various daily necessities. The rationing of matches and soap has been decided and will be piloted in the First and Eighth Districts. If the results are good, it will be extended to the entire city. The First and Eighth Districts were originally scheduled to implement the system on the 4th, but due to the printing of purchase certificates and other procedures, implementation could not proceed as scheduled and must be postponed for a few days. It is expected to be announced and implemented within a few days. According to reliable sources, each person will receive one piece of soap (half a block) and one small package of matches per month, rationed once a month and sold at a limited price. Citizens can purchase these items at designated retail stores by presenting their purchase certificates, following the same procedure as buying rice.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Supply of Goods at Consumer Cooperative Still Not Smooth <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizen Consumer Cooperative was initiated by leaders of the city's business community with the aim of suppressing prices, preventing illegal hoarding, and reducing the daily burden on citizens. It has been half a year since its establishment, and goods have been distributed twice. However, due to various reasons, all the goods listed on the list cannot be supplied to all members as scheduled, or are delayed. It was learned yesterday that the person in charge of the cooperative, realizing that this situation greatly affects the interests of the members, has been discussing improvements for days. As for the distribution of the third batch of goods, there is still no news, but all members are hoping that it will be carried out soon so that they can choose their desired items.</p>

<p>Hu Xiaorong Murder Case, Mute Returns to the Scene</p>
<p>Central News Agency report: Hu Xiaorong, an apprentice at the Jingyi Factory on Molao Road, was murdered on May 19th of this year. His mother, Hu Wangmin, came to Shanghai and claimed that the factory owner's younger brother, Lin Cai, was heavily involved. She filed a lawsuit with the local prosecutor's office. After receiving the lawsuit, the prosecutor's office conducted an investigation. The defendant Chen Lin Cai resisted the summons twice, and only appeared on the third summons. The prosecutor then detained him. Yesterday, another court hearing was held, and Wu Cui, a mute, and another girl were subpoenaed to testify. When the mute described what she had witnessed, she was choked up and unable to speak, which was very pitiful. After the court instructed her to point out the people involved, it was determined that the situation was clear. The defendant was ordered to be returned to custody to await further proceedings.</p>
<p>Prosecutor's Office Abolishes Car Service for Staff</p>
<p>Chen Bingjun, the chief prosecutor of the prosecutor's office, in order to conserve resources during wartime, yesterday informed his staff that the practice of using public vehicles or transfers to pick up and drop off public officials for daily commutes was acceptable in peacetime. However, during wartime, gasoline is difficult to procure, and electricity and firewood are also expensive. If the old habits are continued, it will not only increase the burden on the government but also violate the wartime conservation policy. All staff members should understand the current difficulties and no longer use cars for transportation to and from work.</p>

<p>Economic Circles' Review</p>
<h3 id="e47">Since Strengthening the Control System <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the war, the country that has implemented the most effective economic controls among the participating nations is undoubtedly our ally, Japan. As an island nation, Japan's ability to control the vast Pacific War economically is undoubtedly due to its strict control policies. Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and the United States and Britain have also implemented strict control systems. The stronger and more thorough the control system, the more balanced wartime prices and the more stable people's livelihoods, which is a direct proportion.</p>
<p>Observing the recent improvement in Shanghai's economic situation – the disappearance of speculators, the liquidation of hoarders, the trend of price stabilization, the gradual relaxation of tensions, and the gradual resettlement of itinerant traders – allows us to feel the effects that have been achieved since strengthening the control system. Current facts such as the sealing up of forty-one gauze factories with non-compliant registrations, the Grain Control Association's implementation of rice procurement this week, the imminent rationing of soap and matches, the consideration of salt rationing, and the reasonable rectification of prices in various industries all show that the authorities' determination to strengthen the control system is growing day by day.</p>
<p>The key to strengthening the control system lies in the awareness that the people should have under a controlled economy, which can be summarized as follows: Absolutely obey national control laws, Defeat actions that hinder the control system, Participate in various movements to increase production, Eliminate the idea of satisfying one's own desires, Everyone should embrace the idea of "everyone has food to eat," especially the executors of control should be careful not to abuse their power for personal gain, and those subject to control should be careful not to take risks. Only in this way will the executors and those subject to control not be subject to national legal sanctions.</p>

<p>Since the government implemented the policy of purchasing yarn, more than 280 weaving factories in the city have suspended operations due to the interruption of raw materials. The livelihood of the workers in each factory has become a problem. Therefore, the cloth factory trade association to which the industry belongs has prepared a document requesting the National Commercial Control Association to provide relief, and stated that they should provide raw materials earlier to maintain production. It is known that the Commercial Control Association is quite sympathetic to this. However, because the allocation issue must await the approval of the government authorities, the Commercial Control Association has no decision-making power. Therefore, it has replied to the association, promising to forward the application for relief to the government after it distributes materials.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Increasing Cotton Production Requires Adjusting Purchase Prices; Control Authorities Will Use This as a Guideline <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>In order to re-handle the unified cotton procurement work, the National Commercial Control Association decided to dissolve the Cotton Industry Professional Committee and establish a Cotton Department to take charge of the matter. It is now the harvest season for new cotton this year, and if the climate is normal in the next one or two months, the future can be expected to be optimistic.</p>
<p>However, according to the opinions expressed by authoritative figures in the cotton industry, the main area for raw cotton production is the area north of the Yangtze River. Last year, because the price of raw cotton was restricted too low by the military, farmers were unwilling to cultivate it, and even changed cotton fields to plant miscellaneous grains with higher profits, so the cotton field area decreased. This phenomenon has not improved until this year, so the cotton field area is still smaller than in the past. To achieve the same or greater harvest than in the past on a smaller area, special technical improvements are necessary. The control authorities, aware of this, have been working to improve cotton technology this year. At the same time, in order to break the established fact of reduced cotton fields, there is a strong intention to appropriately adjust the purchase prices set in the past so that farmers are happy to plant cotton and are happy to sell the cotton they produce. It can be seen that adjusting cotton purchase prices is a good way to encourage farmers to plant cotton and expand cotton fields. If this plan is implemented smoothly, then an increase in cotton production can be expected, and the current year's work of control can achieve satisfactory results. The Commercial Control Association's cotton procurement work will use this principle as a guideline.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Chinese stock market situation was mostly waiting for the resumption of the stock market. However, small amounts of profits were sold off, and under the general downward trend, there was no shortage of late absorption, so although the prices of various stocks fell, they were mostly stable. Some stocks, such as those in the financial and cultural industries, were held by investors, and prices rose. Other stocks, such as Dachunghua Matches and Jingfu Shirts, rose due to news of capital increases. Public utilities fell the most, while other stocks such as department stores and new businesses experienced small declines. Trading was not dull. The movements of stocks in various industries are recorded below.</p>
<p>Financial: There were no sellers. Continental Bank rose slightly, and Xinye and Jincheng Salt Industry also rose. Shanghai China South, China First, and Zhongyi Trust remained stable, while Xinye Bank saw a slight decrease.</p>
<p>Cultural: World Book Bureau traded in a narrow range and then remained stable. The Commercial Press and Zhonghua Book Company rose due to limited supply. Yongxiang Printing, Standard Paper, Qingong, and Jinfeng Paper all had transactions, with prices similar to last weekend.</p>

Sincere Company also fell. The price of Sincere Department Store after the dividend remained stable, with balanced supply and demand. Guanghua Department Store was weak and lacked energy.</p>
<p>Textiles: The fluctuations of Wing On Textile were even smaller, and it was weaker in the afternoon. Da Sheng Factory No. 1 suddenly saw an increase, while Factory No. 3 remained stable. Dafeng and Qinyi both rose to their former levels. Rongfeng Weaving saw a slight decline, due to the sharp rise in the past few days. Zhongfang Xinhe also saw a decline. The trading of Mayar Silk entered the market, and the prices of Lunhua, Meilun, Tianlun Silk Weaving, and Dagong Dyeing were stable. Zhentai Wool Weaving was strong, while Hong Yi, Wuhe, Hongxing, and Dachunghua Weaving were stable. The buying interest in Jingfu Shirts was firm, and the trading price of Jinglun was close to its par value.</p>
<p>Industry: Dachunghua Matches initially saw a slight decline in the morning, but the demand suddenly increased in the afternoon, causing it to rise sharply by half a grade, with very few sellers. Nanyang Tobacco Company remained at its original price, while Huacheng remained stable. Jiuan Industry and United Industry saw more gains in the afternoon, while China Industry, excluding dividends, was still favored by investors. Guohua and China Investment remained stable as before. New Asia Jianrong fluctuated slightly lower. The price of Zhonghua Cinema, excluding dividends, was still being absorbed. Standard MSG and Fumin Dairy were stable. Kangyuan Weaving, Guan Sheng Yuan, and Meilin Canned Food all showed weakness. Sanyou Industry was the only one that stood firm.</p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals: New Asia saw fluctuations inside and outside the customs area, but eventually remained stable. China France and China Four, and China England Three pharmacies all saw a small decline. The prices of Wuzhou Pharmacy and Xin Xing Pharmaceutical Factory were stable.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Business Summary <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Public Bonds: The market for unified public bonds was unusually quiet yesterday, with very little trading. Prices continued to struggle to rise, and confidence was weak. Other transactions were not carried out at all. Category C bonds were also weak and unable to do anything. However, because there was too little trading, it dissipated around 11:00, so the final levels were no different from last weekend.</p>
<p>Rice and Grain: Yesterday's grain market saw a moderation in sentiment due to news that the Rice Association was actively engaged in procurement, leading to a decrease in buyers. Prices therefore fell. Oil grains were cold due to free circulation and ample supply, and also showed a weakening trend.</p>
<p>Rayon: Trading was quiet. Investors were very aggressive in acquiring, and sellers took the opportunity to push up prices, so prices were frequently called higher.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Regarding Hopes for Grain <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Jingbai</p>
<p>During wartime, it is a good method for the government to implement unified control and rationing of daily necessities such as food and clothing for the people, and to prohibit merchants from freely monopolizing supplies. However, the unified control and rationing in our country often fails to satisfy the people, especially concerning the grain issue, which is often criticized by the general public. This isn't a problem with the theory of unified control and rationing itself, but rather because the technical mechanisms for managing grain administration are not yet perfect and comprehensive. Here are a few points that I personally feel, which I offer to the grain administration authorities.</p>
<p>Firstly, grain transportation specialists cannot be effectively handled by outsiders to the grain industry. The grain administration authorities should hire trustworthy personnel from within the grain industry to manage it. For other administrative documents and cashier personnel, it is best to openly recruit new people. This demonstrates open operations and avoids suspicion of monopoly. It also has the effect of mutual supervision, reducing opportunities for collusion and fraud. The grain administration should create and publicize a list of the names, positions, and work situations of all levels of staff who are sincere and employed, so that the public can know who are truly serving the public with integrity and enthusiasm. If there are further instances of fraud, the true names of the perpetrators and those involved should also be publicized. Do not handle matters vaguely, lest it encourage future imitators. In workplaces dealing with the public, it is best to imitate window service methods used by postal administrations and railways. The names of those on duty should be clearly marked. If those on duty do anything out of line, everyone can report them by name for public investigation. I think if the grain administration authorities can truly implement this, those who come to serve will definitely not dare to commit fraud.</p>
<p>Regarding financial matters, the expenses of the grain administration can be roughly divided into three types: salary and allowance costs, administrative costs, and transportation costs. I believe that for salaries and allowances, it is necessary to ensure that the staff can live stably in order to work hard. Do not allow staff to feel threatened by their living conditions, which may lead to corruption and neglect of work. It is hoped that the grain administration authorities will always guarantee the lives of the staff, eliminating the initial idea of such misconduct in advance, which would be a wise measure. As for administrative and transportation costs, efforts must be made to reduce them as much as possible. Save where possible, and do not waste a single cent.</p>
<p>Regarding grain prices, there is currently a large discrepancy between the official grain prices and market prices, especially in cities, where the difference can even be about three times. People generally say that the official price is indeed too low and too far from the market price, which makes it particularly difficult to collect grain. This reason is actually not sufficient. The original intention of the unified control and rationing system for materials is to prevent prices from rising. The current situation is that the general prices of goods are higher than the official grain price. The proper thinking is that grain prices should not be raised further, as this will stimulate commodity prices, creating a causal cycle. The general commodity prices should be lowered, which would be reasonable. Regarding lowering general commodity prices, the grain administration does not have this power, so we will not discuss it for now. Before the general commodity prices are lowered, in order to facilitate the purchase of grain, the government may designate the continued materials that have been purchased and confiscated by related industries to be handed over to the grain administration in food-scarce areas. According to the situation of the obtained grain, exchange and ration them at low prices. This would not only allow farmers to obtain cheap necessities but also quickly lower general commodity prices, which would be a win-win situation.</p>
<p>Regarding procurement and transportation, in the past, many places used a system of proportional allocation based on acreage to purchase grain at official prices. The county, district, towns, townships, and then the baojia system would order farmers to hand over grain and receive payment based on the acreage they cultivated. As a result, poor farmers with many mouths to feed but little land had to hand over the grain they had barely set aside for their own use. The wealthy, who owned hundreds of acres of fertile land, could sell the remaining grain at high prices because they still had excess grain after the allocation. This method is obviously unreasonable. It is hoped that the grain administration will not use the allocation system in the future. Otherwise, they should calculate the acreage of the farmer's land and deduct the grain reserved for their own use based on the number of people in the household. If there is any surplus grain, then purchase it. In that case, the wealthy may as well sell their surplus, and those who do not have enough can naturally be exempt. Regarding transportation, of course, seek speed, low cost, and convenience. In addition, a separate procurement and transportation certificate should be created, with an original and a duplicate, clearly stating the type of grain, the quantity procured, the quantity shipped, the packaging marks, the shipping location, and the destination, etc. The issuing agency should provide certification at the shipping location. The original should be carried by the escort for verification, while the duplicate should be mailed by the certifying agency to the public office or grain administration at the destination for comparison. Then, there will be no more fraud on the road during transportation.</p>
<p>Regarding quantity, the grain procured and transported by the grain administration, except for military use, is used to ration urban residents and people who do not have grain income. In the past, due to the type of grain, the amount rationed was really too small. Residents had to seek it on the black market due to their urgent needs. As a result, the black market went wild, and the goal of unified control and rationing almost had no position. It is hoped that the amount rationed can be gradually increased in the future, roughly at the rate of one and a half liters per person per month, otherwise the black market will not be reduced.</p>
<p>Regarding, currently, the method for the public to purchase rationed grain is that, except for a small number of large food canteens and institutions that purchase original packages from the grain administration, the majority of the public purchases from specially contracted retail outlets. Because the number of specially contracted retail outlets is extremely large and scattered, the grain administration cannot supervise them everywhere, which often leads to short weighing, swapping inferior grain, and mixing in miscellaneous things. It is hoped that the grain administration will find a way to abolish specially contracted retail outlets and set up its own retail outlets, with one outlet set up in each baojia district in the city. Then supervision can be thorough. Or reduce the number of specially contracted retail outlets, setting up one outlet for every two or three Lianbao as a standard, which can also reduce expenses and facilitate supervision. Regarding weights and measures, it is necessary to ensure that the scales are level and the dipper is full, and not allow slanting views of the bottom. Small dippers with shallow sides and small liters, caused by pressing the thumb on the surface, make it even easier to cheat, so they should not be used often. If setting up your own retail outlets, then the surplus or shortage of grain that occurs due to retail weighing should be certified by the supervisor and reported to the grain administration. In this way, short weighing can be reduced. When the grain is rationed with several types of grain each time, the specific type, quality, and quantity should be clearly specified. Do not vaguely say "either this or that". If there is substandard grain this time, and it is not sold uniformly everywhere, then you can designate a group of retail outlets from number X to number Y to sell the lower-quality grain, and rotate the exchange in the next period. Then the word "or" can no longer be needed. The drawbacks of swapping and mixing can definitely be reduced.</p>
<p>The ancients said: "The state is based on the people, and the people take food as their heaven." The grain issue, especially the grain issue during wartime, is indeed an important policy that must be handled well and cannot be easily handled. Its difficulty lies in the magnitude of its impact on the national economy and people's livelihood and the ease with which corruption can occur. Wise grain administration authorities, for the sake of the country and the people, will surely strive hard, be unyielding, and overcome this difficulty.</p>

<h3 id="e55">The Benefits of Red Rice <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Renren</p>
<p>In the past two months, the household rice received every period has been brown rice? Brown rice is red in color, and people call it red rice because of its color. It is quite hard. If cooked improperly, it often results in uneven, hard grains, making the cooked rice difficult to swallow. Thus, people complain. In fact, red rice is very good. Each liter can cook two more bowls of rice than white rice. When cooking rice, just add more water, let it boil thoroughly, soak it longer, and steam it enough, and you will succeed in making delicious red rice. Moreover, red rice contains more vitamin B, which can cure beriberi, because its embryo has not been removed. White rice is delicious, but its effects are far inferior. In this era of scarcity, everything should know that material resources are scarce! The authorities have put in a lot of effort to maintain the rationing of household rice! We are fortunate to be able to eat red rice, why complain?</p>
<p>Chinese Church Daoyi Council raises funds for the orphanage</p>
<p>The Chinese Church Daoyi Council, in order to rescue orphans, established an orphanage in Dongyaotaoyuan, Wuxi, which has been completed and has begun to accept children. The planned quota is 100 people, and the temporary care fee for each person is 300 yuan per month, requiring 3,600 yuan per year. Yesterday, a meeting of directors was held at the council's office, presided over by Bishop Qian. More than 30 people attended, including Lin Kanghou and Huang Liang. After Chairman Shen Shenshun of the Council reported, a discussion was held on raising regular expenses for the orphanage. The directors each took responsibility for their respective tasks and hoped that philanthropists from all walks of life would adopt orphans.</p>
