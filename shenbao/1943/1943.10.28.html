<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">市民應如何協力治安 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>友邦日本的憲兵，無論在部隊的編制與組織，以及知識與訓練，各方面都比較一般國家尤為嚴密與注重，這是稍知日本軍隊情形者所公認的。因此，日本憲兵的特質，可以「公正」「嚴肅」形容之。目前在和平區各地的日本憲兵，尤其注重於「公正」的守則，我們知道上海的日本憲兵部隊，除了軍隊警察的任務以外，還担負着一切政治，經濟，防衛的重要任務，例如警衛洽安，偵察奸宄，肅淸恐怖，消滅反動等等特殊工作，而常保持「公正」的風範。</p>
<p>自從大東亞戰爭爆發以後，上海治安，逐漸確立。以至安定，恐怖案件，逐漸滅少，以至絕跡。當然，大部份應歸功於及邦憲兵部隊及其他各警備機關之努力的結果。但是，在憲兵執行任務的過程中，若干案件，因為言語上的隔膜，因為屬俗習慣的互異，或許發生小小的誤會，同時，引起民間的恐懼，也在所難免。這種事實，我們願意雙方應該坦白的承認，惟有坦白的承認，才有改善與矯正的勇氣，而將誤會完全消除。</p>
<p>我們前會於五月二十五日社評，以「對對於友邦現地當局一個請求」為題，略進芻　之言。當五月二日及同月二十四日友邦憲兵當局發表談話。：以「本市常有不逞之徒，潛冒日憲兵隊名義，串同向無辜市民橫加脅迫，詐取金錢。自本年初至四月底之四個月中，破獲冒名　詐案件計二十七件，罪犯三十六名，其中華人二十三名，日人及其他國人十三名，均經分別嚴懲。嗣後市民如感覺有捏造憲兵或憲兵隊暗探名義，而有不法舉動者，應立即報吿就近憲兵隊，以便拘捕，希望中日人民相警相戒，協力取締，以期達到建設明郎大上海之目的」。我們根據談話的主旨，主張市民如遇憲驚香　詢不必慌張，坦白應對，是非極易明辯；如認為來者有懷疑之處，則不存怕事心理，據實報告就近憲兵隊，必須瞭解這是協力憲兵當局取締不逞之徒應有之舉動。我們詔為市民對於憲兵隊的認識不夠，昧終情勢，在「怕事心理」之下，甘於隱忍者，正不在少。其結果足以助長不逞之徒為非作歹的風氣，而為憲兵當局澈底取締的障碍。</p>
<p>從彼時到今天，巳經五個月了，對於冒名索詐案件是否絕跡，其間雖未見憲兵當局正式文吿，但據社會上的風傳，尚有所聞，我們於此，除堅持從前的主張以外，願再強調及補充所見如次：</p>
<p>第一，市民如因事或牽涉而被憲兵部傳訊時，對於憲兵處理案件的原因，必然根據於某種情報或報吿，決不會隨便驚動，對此必須先具很正確的認識。並注意左列數事：</p>
<p>如有詢間，絕對說老實話，毫不假借與虛偽。</p>
<p>勿必存慌張與害怕心理，接受處置，經過相當詢間　詞查之後，如屬冤枉，即可釋放。勿必受少數不逞之徒的欺騙，使用賄賂，行賄賂者心必自虛，反會弄假成真，於是賄賂愈急切，釋放愈困難。</p>
<p>如果問心無辜，被誣受冤；或為少數中國工作人員圖詐而裁陷受屈者，可隨時向憲兵部隊據實吿發，我們雖未見憲兵部隊公布因被誣而吿發反坐案件，可是，我們相信，憲兵部隊在要求市民合作協助取締冒名索詐的誠意之下，一經吿發，定必嚴辦。</p>
<p>第二，恐怖案件，雖已減少，幾至絕跡，但不可因此疏忽，隨時嚴防，這是每個市民共有的資任。因為萬一無意識的案件發生，左之各地區莫不遭受運累。所以；各為保護自己居住之安全，必須幫助消滅不肯份子的蠢動。</p>
<p>第三，對於嚴防不肖份子潛跡，我們主張　憲兵當局應與各地區保甲長加強聯擊，取得充分協力。因為保甲長對於本保甲的住民動態比較熟悉。　外埠來滬者，向保甲處申請登記以後，由保甲處轉向憲兵部隊報吿，嚴密查察入口市民之行動，以防不逞之徒混跡。</p>
<p>總之，維護社會秩序之央謐，為當局與市民共同的要求，共同的責任，就須共同協力促成之。</p>
<h3 id="c2">日首相外相闡明　解放戰根本目標　在衆院預算會中答覆質問 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京二士七日中央社電日衆院議員中為彌團次，二士七日於衆院預算總會發出質間如次：當茲英。美已被逐出大東亞之今日，為基於八　一字精神，使南方各民族各得其所，應以以下六條為原則，以確保次東亞之自治態勢，即　取消人　差別。　民族平等互讓，　基於互惠主義，責行經濟提攜，　發展井溝通文化，　解放資，　共同防術衛大車亞。對此重光外相答復如次：大東亞之建設乃以各次民族之自動協力為基礎，故須以互讀精神為準則，此非僅限於大東亞，且係應　布於世界。繼此。中島議員復實間稱：澈底使世界各國認義大東亞之運　及日本之戰爭目的後，英。美當即失卻其戰爭目的，棄卻其武器　國民政府</p>
<p>東亞人士必須護衛鄉土　　得解放。問於自由自度　時政府之成立，英　國亦將發空頭支票亦未可知，然印度之解放，仍必須以印度人自已之奮鬥方可獲得也，東亞乃陳亞人之鄉土，乃東亞人之根本置身地，故吾人不能不衛此此鄉土。此次戰爭，英。美乃企圖　經濟武力而壓倒日本，倘日本不能完成其任務　大東亞勢必重人於英　美之壓迫　取下，故使東亞由敵人之侵略鐵蹄下獲得解放、亦即此次戰爭之目的，大東亞之共存共榮，即世界之共存共榮，束亞願對世界各國以廣行溝通文化，取消人種差別及互　互議精神有所貢獻，因吾人具有如此之崇高精神，故亦具有必勝信念，古來以違反正發之帝國主義而獲成攻者幾希，有則僅鴉片戰爭而已”獨立戰爭乃美國人以衛護鄉土而發動之戰爭，最後獲得勝利者，因係其精神而非武器也。大東亞民族所要求者，僅為共存共榮，互惠互讓，以此情神而奮鬥者，乃今日之大東亞之真姿態。</p>
<h3 id="c3">日政府方面提案　兩院已審議完畢　各委會展開建設的論議 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>

<h3 id="c4">滿政府方面表明見解 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>

<p>柏林　七日中央社電　德元首行　廿六日正午發表：　東綫南部梅立托波爾區及柴普魯基東南部廿五日戰事最為熾烈，敵軍反覆攻擊，經激戰後已受阻，德軍已將突入陣地內之敵軍擊退。聶伯河灣曲側而仍有激戰，德軍將一切重要軍事設施被壞後，已自尼普員惡羅夫斯克撤退。攻擊克里伏洛格之蘇軍復增派新銳部隊，已於該市北方連續激戰數次，迄今尚未突破德軍陣地，據軍坦克車部隊自西北方對蘇軍之側面加以反擊已突入敵軍陣地，以教援克里伏洛格交戰中之德軍。又蘇軍曾以強力部隊自克里曼卓西北方之橋頭堡發動攻勢，德軍當即反攻將其擊退。基輔東南方北方及柴爾民哥夫四北方等數地點，曾展開局部激戰，德軍於各地點均將敵軍擊退。克里契夫西方蘇軍以步兵數師，終廣汛戰綫亦曾發動攻勢。然德軍展開猛烈之反擊後，已將於數地點突入之敵軍部隊擊退至攻勢開始前之地點。斯摩倫斯克西方及維里基魯基南方僅有小規模戰門。</p>
<p>克里伏洛格市戰略地位重要</p>
<p>柏林廿七日中央社電　德元首行營廿六日發表戰報，德軍已自尼普貝特羅夫斯克撤退，此足證蘇軍對該方面顯已增加重大壓力，同導亦表明戰局重大性。按柴普魯基與尼普員特羅夫斯克，位於聶伯河彎曲部南北兩端，乃戰略上二大據點，故德軍前曾於此兩地構築堅固防衛陣地。蘇軍對此則以精銳部隊加以集中攻擊，已於本月十四日將位於河左岸之柴普魯基佔領，今又佔領尼普貝特羅夫斯克，勢將越聶伯河灣曲部向福古河方面前進，致德軍將遭過開戰以來未曾有之重大局面。又自克里曼卓准攻克里伏洛格（CricoiRog）之蘇軍，並威脅德軍之側面，故德軍為避免不必要之損害，必須向聶伯河福古兩河河口方面集結堅面防禦態勢。克里伏洛格乃烏克蘭鐵工業之中心地，且為交通上之要衝，並為烏克關方面德軍極重要之戰略據點，故德軍刻正努力防禦該地。克里伏洛絡方面德蘇兩軍勢將演成熾烈攻防戰。又蘇軍於斯摩倫斯克四南方之克里契夫（Krichev）亦出動精銳預備兵，展開威脅戈美爾北方之作戰，於此地區由於蘇軍之突出戰綫自北至南殆將成一直綫，知有一處突被，則將影響及全綫，故目下德軍正　全力努力防禦。同時德軍優秀之機械化部隊則於克里伏洛格方面對蘇軍加以側面攻擊，以阻止蘇軍之前進，顧此數日之戰局動向將予本年未戰局以重大影響，實堪注目。</p>

<p>軍需省設置論</p>
<p>在戰局的現階設內，航空決戰正日趨劇烈，已是盡人皆知的事實。在陸海空三位一體的立體作戰中，飛機的比重與日俱增。茍未掌握制空權。海陸的補給便極困難。而且，地上戰鬥的歸趨亦可依據航空戰力的強弱而決定。所以航空戰力的增強。尤其是確保飛機的數量，寶為勝利的第一要件。</p>
<p>在這稱形勢下，應舉國家的總力向加緊增產飛機之　邁進，固已無須　言，因此，必須以航空機增產爲決戰生產的最大目標，並以確保其計劃的產量爲全部緊急施策的基調，擴充政備各種有關產業，以生產飛機幾萬架爲計劃目標，則為實現這個目標起見，對於裝配工塲。發動機工塲。螺旋槳工塲及零件工傷的生產規模與能力，應據充到什麼程度；對於特殊鋼。普通鋼。非鐵金屬及化學製品等建般資材需要若千；對於各種工作機械等設備需軍若干；對於勞力。電力·煤氣等動力需要若干，以及其供給源如何等等間題，須通盤籌劃，然後縝思密　以建立金字塔型的綜合性計畫。以航空機增產為申心的超電點生產，非如此不可。爲完遂這一步，必須有草擬及執行生產計畫的強力綜合機關或單一的生產行政機關。因此，軍需省（或生產省）設置論便再度高唱入雲。在過去第四次中央協力會議席上，河村恭輔，鈴木重康民等亦曾熟心要求命令系統及責任所在的一元化。</p>
<p>為期完遂計劃經濟起見，應由具有絕對權限的單一機關負實推進</p>
<p>日本增強生產力量</p>
<p>生產行政，實行生產指導，已無庸多論。根據這種理由，德國則終四年計劃局內設置中央企劃委員會，同時由軍需部充實軍需資材，實現擴充生產的強力一元行玫，美國則於開戰直後毀置有強力執行權的戰時生產局，以及通盤計劃軍需民需之生產，購入及配給事宜的企劃機關；英國也使戰時生產部和軍需生產機構保特直接連擊，測定各工塲的生產能力，實行典之相態的生產比例分配。由此可知，在各主要交戰國中，戰時生產行政的一元化均在日趨完整中。</p>
<p>然而軍需與民需的調整，根本上乃是統帥與政務，作戰與產業的調整問題。統帥權的獨立既是不動的原則，則我們不得不承認軍需省案是有其必然的界限的。再則，「官吏的思想」如不改變，那末單是機構的改革，恐難收得笑過，這點也是非加考慮不可的。因此，改組企畫院，並加以擴充，使有實質的經務參謀本部之性格及機能的方案，共買現性較設置軍需省案為強。今日的企畫院雖担當物資動員及其他國家動員計　劃擬訂及綜合國策之樹立，而且兩者之間有密切的關係，但後者的機能總比較脆弱，而企畫官廳與執行官應的連絡也難期其美美無缺。為改善此點計，實宜改組並充擴企畫院，以各執行官應（包含陸海軍軍務，整備等有關機關在內）的最優秀份子構成「總務以期激動經濟運營的萬全。同時，企盡院除策責令執行官　迅速實行業經內閣會議議決定的方案。如能更進一步使改組後的企書院成為直屬大本營聯絡會議的企書機關，則其效果尤大</p>
<p>定貨統制</p>
<p>如上所述。關於刷新生產行政的理想方案，其實現既有種稱難關，而機構改革所引起的過渡性生產行政之緩滯（自慣例言，一行政機關自成立以至真能發揮效力，至少需時半載）及摩擦，頗有予以決戰生產意外障碍的危險，這點也是應該考慮的。</p>
<p>至於在遂行計書生　的現實面，被指摘為生產行政狹路的定單收發之一元化，以及合理的調整與官　的統制戰最小限度的要求，也必須使之買現。因此。行時行政特例法暨戰時等政犧權特例之更活潑的運用，實為我人拭目以待者。</p>
<p>目前因定　是個別任意掣發的，所以夙負盛　的工　則定單堆積如山，而另一方面，長出名的工廠則不免空閒，因而發生企業所有的全部設備未能完全合理運用的現象。其次：定貨的不加統制，結果可以妨碍由劃分生產分野以期生產質量向上的實現。再則，由於定貨官廳與其他產業官廳缺乏有機的連繫，可使主要材料及次要材料之均街分配成為不可能。往往在同一會社的各工塲，甚至在同一工塲內，亦右資材，技衛員及設備不能互相通融的事例。</p>
<p>在這生產條件不斷變化的決戰階段中，生產行政亦需富有機數性，適應現實的必要，迅速實行生產要素之配置　換或相互融通，以圖增加金體的生產量，實屬必要。這種具右彈性的經濟指導，祗有在定貨統制的某礎上才能有所期待吧。再則，為大規格統一和比例分配生產，在定單的掣發漫無統制時，亦必受到牽制以致妨碍其迅速實現。</p>
<p>關於統制定貨的必要，軍，官，民三方面的意見業已一致。在造船業方面，早已寶現掣發定單的一元化，且於實行造船計書上收得莫大的成效。</p>
<p>關於輾壓機，亦已成立以商工大臣為委員長的輾壓機委員會；至若航空機用工作機械，也由陸海軍和商工省組委員會，與構成　統制會密切連絡，整備推進定貨統制及計畫此產的態勢。又，和飛機及其他兵器生產有莫大關係的特殊鋼，最近在中央則設立由陸海軍，商工省及鋼鐵統制會連合組織成的特殊鋼增產連絡協議會，在地方則設置由煉鋼廠，鋼鐵統制會分會監督官暨工務官組成的連終協議會，將綜合性·賦予此產行政之運營。</p>
<p>定貨統制既須克服其因難性，順應完途決戰生實的現賓要求，一步一步前進，所以這次的「國內能勢強化方策「亦」圖統一軍，官聲方對重要生產之定購」。（吉：譯自同盟世界　報廿四卷第四十號）</p>

<p>流浪的樂園</p>
<h3 id="c59">上海福幼院幸福的生活 <a href="#c59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>這個流浪兒的樂園－上海福幼院裹的孩子們，眞可說是有福了。他們完令和舊時被拋棄被欺凌侮辱的盡慘生活隔絕，走上光明與自立的大道，今後的命運，在導師的指示之下，將由孩子們自己來決定約了。</p>
<p>董斌先生說，自民國三卞一年一月開辦　至目前（三十二年十月），共計收容流浪難意及孤苦兒女三百七五名，其中除了因為原曾習業品學比較優秀的，被社會正當人士領為養子養女以及由自己家　領回者外，現在留院兒童共逹二百二十八名，男生一百六十一名女生六十七名，其中各公團報館及着士們送去的街頭流浪兒童約占百分之四十，孤兒約占百分之四十。其餘為難有家屬而實際上沒有敎義子女能力的賣苦勞工的孩子，也有不堪虐待而逃亡的學徒等等。但是，董斌先生說得對：「現在社會上急待拯救敎養的流浪兒與苦難兒童，還不知有多多少少呢。」</p>
<p>孩子們進了上海福幼院之後，當然首先就不怕挨餓了。初創辦時規定每天一飯二粥，每天平均食米約一百五十斤，雜糧（包括赤豆，苞米粉，麥粞，蔷夢，麵粉，山芋等，約五十斤，菜肴方面，每天用油四斤，蔬菜約一百二十斤。採買，燒煮，以仝分　，都由敎師和孩子們自巳辦理。廚房裏是那麽熱鬧，有的在洗，有的在掃，有的在燃火，有的在磅量。原來食料的分配，係依兒童年齡，體格而定，分為十多組，每組飯菜的分量都不相同，以求適合各人營養所需而不虛耗一分半兩。不過，實際上日常食料對於發育中的兒童，嚴格的說，未免仍有不足之虞，在沒有辦法之中，只有暫定每星期特別加飯一養，並極力設法添輩菜一次。</p>
<p>兒童的健康，除了啓養之外，特別注意衛生。凡送院收容的兒童，首先須赴院醫胡起鵬先生處檢騐，為了全院兒童健康起見，對於有傳染病的兒童，概不收容。騐准收容的兒重，則詳細記載其入所時之健康狀態，以及營養上特別需要，作為今後編組編級及配給食料的根據。大多數在入院以前營養不足，所以在初入院時。不得不給與較豐當的食料，至相當時期後，始與一般學生共賣，在院學生，如發現有疾病者，均由該院療治。在院裏殷有醫療室及病房，特聘護士一名負責全院醫療事務。並特約眼科張錫祺醫　及牙科陳占元醫師　期赴院檢騐。如有重病就送眞心時疫醫院及善德社療治。特別注意衛生淸潔，由全體敎職員密切合作負責監護及幫同處理孩予們的沐浴，換衣，洗滌，縫補，理髪，修指，冷熱照料及病痛尉問諸事，所以院生們都一能防病於未發，保持水準上的健康狀態，不僅成立以來從無死亡事件，即重病與時疫險症也未發生過</p>
<p>住宅雖然是舊式房屋，但古色古香的建築中巳採用較新式的構造方法，一所以空氣與光綫都稱滴度。二樓如宿會，男女分室一，每室容納十餘人至二十餘人，各有一位導師負責監護，因為都是地舖，特別注意整齊淸潔，地板光滑得像寫字台面一樣呢。</p>
<p>軍隊式的管理，家庭式的愛護，我們艷羨這批苦難兒童中的幸運兒的生活。</p>
<p>敎學做合</p>
<p>上海福幼院對於收容的流浪苦難兒意的敎養，實行敎學做三者合一的制度。他們對遺般孩子除授給生活上必要知識之外，並注意他們的品性習慣。生產　術，規定半年必學成一技，給他們造成日　自立謀生之基</p>
<p>小學制。按照實際需要，編訂課程，地董副院長說，雖然成立朱久，然學期終結時，考核一般學業成績，竟超　於普通小學同級的程度。在學習中，實行男女生同學，不另分敎室。現在一二年級學生人數最多，超過全院學生半數以上。因此在敎養上需嬰他人扶助之處也特別多</p>
<p>從三年級起，為了養成其集體活動與生活技能起見，實行半工半讀，每天上午照常上課。下午抽出時問來工作。工作暫分四部：　木工（雕刻），現在因為實際上種種限制，暫時只以雕刻區額楹聯等為主，一部分校具如學生桌椅等，也由學生自己製造校具的修理，輕易也不請敎外人，　油漆，包括調製各種彩色油漆以及實行髹漆工作等等，現在也以　學為主，未至生產性的實際工作階段。　鞋工，敎學縫製布鞋皮鞋技術，以備將來出院筏即可資以維持生活，現在院生用鞋也多是自己縫製的。　園藝，除了學習耕種，灌溉，栽植，培育與收獲等技術之外，還準備將來以一部分收　補充院生的食用。現在校園正在開拓中，有幾處巳播種菜秧，園隅還　養着兩只小猪呢。</p>
<p>為了進行基本的生活技術敎育，他們特別聘有木工，鞋工。栽縫等技師，與敎職員密切合作，推進科學化合理化的敎養計劃。除了正式的學科，工作科之外，對於院生的課外活動，也同樣加以嚴密和親切的性意。從各級級任教育，各科工作導師以至各寢室的監護先生，大家互相協力。造成優良的學習環境，使這二百多名來自各方的流浪與苦難的兒童，自然而然地消失去不良習慣，在集體生活中一漸漸走上光明的正道。</p>
<p>自給自助自治</p>
<p>下課了，孩子們活潑潑地在校園呼吸新鮮空氣，一個個都是精福飽滿意氣豪　的，誰會想到不久以前，正是頭頭垢而號泣求援的街頭流浪兒童哩。</p>
<p>孩子們現在的生活，衣，食，住，學，都由院方供給。你看，一個個穿的簇新的藍布制服，整潔的鞋襪，據說這些都是他們白己縫製起來的。原來們幼院的主持者為着培養兒童的刻苦耐勞習慣，院內只　用工役二人，其他一切日常生活，均由教　員領導兒意工作，實行自給自助。他們還組織「兒童自治指導委“會」，養成兒童自治之精神。</p>
<p>孩子們每天上午六時起身，除了各自盥洗以外，並須整理寢室及全院的淸潔。七時開始早操及早會，九時起上課。中高年級的學生，在下午開始上工作課。在學習精細技術之時，大家屛息靜聽，細心觀察技師的每一動作，一邊就模仿着習作。到了熟練以後，以及在各種比較簡單的工作之時，孩子們就像正式的勞工與士兵別樣，活括潑潑，唱唱做做，樂趣融融，敎師和技工們也一起工作，敎，學、做，完全配合成三位一體了。</p>
<p>孩子們自動組織的福幼生活互助會，分設四股：　糾察股，自己組織了巡察團和戴判所。同學之間有什麼糾紛。或是關於學習與工作上發生”麼問題，都由學生自己來解決，平時學習與工作中的秩序也由學生自己來維護。　學藝股：殷有出版社，編製壁報「福幼報」，源有演講組和圖書館等。　鷹樂股，分殷　藝組，歐一詠組，乒乓隊，體育組　。　衛生股，分設淸潔，　護，炊事等組。一切事務，都由孩子們自己來謀解決。</p>
<p>評言</p>
<h3 id="c60">經濟界全社會之經濟 <a href="#c60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>現代進步的國家，其一切立法之精神、警以全社會之　經濟為前提。什麽叫着「全计會之經濟？」就是謀全社會之福利，尤北是在戰爭中少數人雖因而致富。多數國民曾巳陷於資乏與困苦的時候，凡有所影響於全民福利輿大眾生活者，必須後消極與按極兩方面同時　謀所以解決之道；舉凡戰時食物價格之　定，日常用品之配給，减輕人民之生活負担，策劃人民之居住安全，以至這有飢饉，政府有供給其人民以榖米之義務，固無一不為全社會之福利所繫，亦即所謂「全社會之經濟」問題，所以戰時的國家，其有關經濟之法規所以如是嚴密者，藍出於對外爭取國家之勝利，對內保持社會之安齊。</p>
<p>我們有感於全社會之福利，即為全社會之經濟，所以認為社會福利問題，也就是戰時經濟問願的前提。最近本市市民福利協會與社會福利局，均先後以本市一般無告窮民及流浪街頭之老弱殘廢，孤苦兒童之飢寒苦况為討論之中心，且巳擬定殷施步驟與募款辦法；前者似不外於施衣，施粥，及舉辦庇寒所等等，後者似不外於義演售券一途。我們既認街頭流浪者確為社會經濟病態之一，確為大眾生活不能解決的一個顯例，則其補救之道，似有賴於一個比較有計劃的設施方案與比較大規模的募款辦法，由政府與參加社會福利運動之民間經濟界人士共起而圖之，因為在戰時言全社會之經濟者，斷不容飢饉狀態之繼績存在。飢饉狀態的消減，就是最後勝利的保證。</p>

<p>戰爭的狀况喝日趨激烈，戰局現正突入決戰階段·在這緊要關頭政府應舉一切人力，物力，集中於戰爭的遂行，積極整頓政治，經濟體制。可是爲其推進力的國民精神之統一結合方策，尚不無遺憾。戰爭如其長期化，戰局如其　趨　雜，則在情勞的判斷上，當然產生異論，而混淆戰爭的指導理念，這在任何國家，無不皆然。現在日本在遂行戰爭上所必須者，乃集中國民的精神力於事滅英美的一點，使敵方的宣傳謀略無所施其伎倆。際此決戰階段，爲提醒國民的覺悟。特請本社社　德寫蘇峰翁及前駐華大使本多熊太耶翁揭載其對談於報上，希望大家銘記兩氏熱烈憂國的至情。以下為其速記要旨：</p>
<h3 id="c68">德富蘇翁 <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>從我的理想說來，現在政府官員中，最熱心工作着總得算是東條君。不過一般國民　沒有跟着東條君亦步亦趨，逍遙自在，讓東條君獨自在那裏忙碌。老實國來，一切都流於一般形式。這些現在暫時放開不說，來談　戰爭的問體，這戰爭究竟有何意義，誰也沒有徹底想一下。像本多先生那樣立在外交指導立塲的外交官，與他作過一次談話的人們，我以爲爲了日本的外交恐不無裨益吧！對於中國的事情，非常清楚，我在明治三十九年去過一次，在北京會見先生，恰值先生和阿部守太耶二位在中國的時　。而且先生出席過全世界所有的大會　，出現於一切的大舞臺，所以一切的事情知道得都很清楚。</p>
<p>東條君所說的話，　際上　未實行，眞是可情，這些都是今日最重要的工作，而眞正實行的人是下級的人們。尤其是學生等、因國家的危愈而共赴困難。我有一孫在　軍兵學校，雖然今年因有病，亦不顧身體如何仍在　　中，說到我的年靑的　戚們，也有人想　事　空。我另有一個孫兒已　決投効空軍。這僅就我的身邊而言　其他的靑年，恐怕也都很熱心地工作着今日先生　不如學生，是學生拖着先生跑的時代這就是表示日本的精神日木在有的地方非常熱。有的地方非常冷。有的地方非常眞實，有的地方非常虛浮。</p>
<p>我對於先生的意日最表共鳴的，是日本人不知道萬一不幸而敗續　的慘苦。那必須是知道日本情形的人那是參加戊辰之役的會津的人們。祗有會津的人們才相常深刻地嘗到敗軍之慘的情形。但那些前輩已經多死了，現在的人是其子或其孫，所以日一本此次祗知道勝利不知其他。因而敗戰的苦况一點也不知道，敗績是怎樣的慘苦，日本人對此全無感覺，於是把戰爭當作　稀鬆平常的一件事。戰爭開始之後，就可以停止，恰比二人角力，經過三個囘合之戰，不論勝負，就可以結束。不過今日的戰爭，因戰爭的原因不同，所以……</p>
<p>本多熊太郎翁</p>
<p>對的，戰爭的原因不同。德富時至今日，不是日本爲東亞的盟主驅逐英美，便是英美成爲東亞的盟主驅逐日本。不是他們殺我們，便是我們殺他們。没有別條路，沒有剛立的妥協的餘地。如有這種餘地，則在朱戰之前，就可以妥協了。所以無論如何這次戰爭非　即敗。所以道一次的戰爭我以爲不能不略爲徹底的考察一下。渝方的態度。今日是枝節問題。日本此次勝於英美者，日本的旗幟　明。如其這成爲不動的事賈，則對方就要號泣，和以前不同，這是因爲覺悟前非，今後不知如何才好，祗有出之於一哭。假使不在根本上　集中力景於　　英美，日本沒有立脚的地方。對方也有着相當弱點。強處固然有，然弱點更多。我們實長期問研究莽美的學問，其弱點在那裏，某點怎樣，大體上都很明瞭。無論從社會上看來，從經濟的組織上看來，被綻不可勝計。不過他們以爲日本是困苦的，所以維持其破綻，一旦知道日本不苦的時候，對方和日本不同，他們沒有一天萬　的天皇，對方的所謂大總統者，等於公司的經理般的東四。</p>
<p>本多</p>
<p>方才先生所說的</p>
<p>弱點有種種。現在略說點專門語。在此的的戰爭的時俟，邱吉爾親口說過，親耳聽見，德國正在從事準備，可見我們全出　外，受人冷拳的話－這是說謊－。他說我們只要　時而動，以龐大的英國資源，和國民性之偉大，何往弗屆，可是現在也在說着遙遙無期的百年大計了。日本在緒戰中是勝利了，但以美國的工業生產力，再加上英國的力量，可以長期戰來嚇嚇日本。但現在這恐嚇已不生效力了。我所感到的用長期戰來恐嚇，今春以來，非常焦　。</p>
<p>即在美國方而，也是很焦慮的樣子。羅斯　　說的作戰，在專門的軍人，也不知道是怎麽一囘事，美國尤所焦虑者，美國的經濟生活，或國內經濟的戰時體制化，至少此日本落後三年。自從珍珠濟一役以後。愈起　追。他們所轉以代步的汽車開不動了，肉類也憑　　　了，這種迅速戰時體制化的生活，國民對此的忍受，即其忍耐力，非我們日本人之比。那立即成爲一撫社會問题，產生一種社會現象，於是金錢滔滔地被使用着，政府無論用何種調節策，如欲漸漸地流對金錢。就要變爲通貨膨　。然而在日本，正如先生所說那樣的國家，我們有着必死之心，因為是在生死存亡之秋，所以大家都咬緊牙齒，不顧一切，欣然耐受着重的負擔，而對方，從羅斯福的立塲說來，一切都從來年大總統這舉戰的角度出發。來年的選舉戰中，不能不用盡一切方法希望述任。羅斯福業已破了三次的肇國以來的傳統，此次又預備第四次連任了，所以無論如何不能不樹立非常無理的作戰計劃，因而其作戰是非常盲撞的，無論人，物，不能不付出無謂的犧牲，那本來是善於宣傳的國家，本國的損失。說得很少，而勝利則宣傳得特別大。但這些必須有可以壓制國民的戰果。這是去年八月以來蘇羅門，新幾尼亞方面戰事激烈化的原因。總之，一面希望強迫人民來舉行來年的選舉，同時，又希望從速結京戰爭，這在羅斯福是把戰爭本身當作一秤政治的策略。戰爭開始到德國投降至，會居於倫敦四年一月。最近因爲沒有新　來，所以重溫前次大戰時閱讀的書　，得到了很多的啓發。自一九一年八月初起，經十四年，十五年，至十六年，即戰爭第三年，經二年的戰爭之後，雖然戰詩是戰勝的德國，或立在被動的地位作長期戰的英法，都因沒有結束戰爭的方法，故對於戰爭的處理，極感熄間。其中俄羅斯在一九一七年坐因半途發生革命而崩潰，後因美國的加入而產生意外的結果。俊使美國不參加，結果如何，正未可。要之，在英國的場合　來，阿斯基斯內閣何故解散，　和阿斯基斯單　內閣之後，和保守黨組織聯合內閣，那聯合內閣在一九一六年十二月被勞合商洽從內部投下炸彈而卒告解散。目這勞合喬治的內閣實際上亦是以保守黨爲基本的內國，那時俟恰值爲了誘使奧國單獨講和，法國的白里安內閣，英國的阿斯基斯內閣，常在憂患餘生之中。用武力的戰爭以結東戰爭的困難，因想改用政治工作來結束戰爭，所以　國不必說，英法常然也常在苦思焦慮。二年之後，在戰塲上占優勢的德國，和劣勢的英法，同都希望結束戰爭。在前次大戰中，英國用所有的資本利息和紅利以供戰費，利息與紅利不足，甚至用資本金。然而戰後的英國，雖然祇有過了十年，便以為世界不會再有戰爭了。事實上，英國因爲有着想不用戰爭以完成制霸世界大勢的自信，所以縮減陸軍，甚至縮減海軍，於是乃一有軍備縮減的計劃。（待續）（翔：　自十月十九</p>

<h3 id="c69">展開識字運動張啓揚 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>爲了闡明識字運動的產要，爲了使大家普這地認識，識字運動在建國過程中所占地位的產要，我們特別強調地提出國族的盛衰，胥賴國民文化水準的高下，國民文化水準的高下，全親國民識字運動的能否普遍。</p>
<p>我們首先應該認淸：識字運動決不是義務教靑，更不是小學教靑。它是在政府機關須導之下，正軌敎青輔　之下的民衆自覺運動。一方面是政府有機的倡導；一方面是社會先進及敎育界人士的熱忱推行；另一方面更含有民衆的自覺意識。這是識字運動的特質。如果忽親了這點，那末識字運動就無從談起，無從進行，而其結果必歸於失敗。</p>
<p>不能否認的，今日的文盲的確多得太驚人。人民顚沛流離，妄論識字敎育，，社會杌隍不安，政府亦無睱顧及。但　乎識字運動政關國族之前途旣如此重大，故不敢默而不言。茲依據識字運動的特質，並審察當前的環境，杜　一識字運動方案綱要（其詳細辦法當待敎育專家一及行政常局愼重精密之　一訂）以提供大家討論論：</p>
<p>教育行政機關　集國內具有實際經驗之敎育界人士，組織識字運動促進委員會嗚精密釐訂識字運動實施辦法、責成各級學校及社會有關團體實施之，</p>
<p>編　民衆識字課本：以淺顯易諧及切合民衆實際生活爲原則，免費發給文盲，其印刷費用由教育部　請國府頭給之。</p>
<p>卉朱展開此運動之前，先利用保甲制度，由保甲處會同其他地方自治機關調查文盲確數。</p>
<p>將所有文肓，依據保甲區域均匀分配。再利用當地學校社團及各種公一共塲所，實施敎學。</p>
<p>教師可利用小學敎師，師範生，中學生，大學生等之課外時問，義　教授，且不得推諉。其成績優良者由政府獎勵褒揚，其成績低劣者加以相當之懲處。</p>
<p>利用小先生，即知即傳，以求迅速。同顧事變　陶行知先生倡導於前，各地民衆教育團體及師範學校嚮應於後。試騐結果喝成績卓著。可惜當時當局朱予竭力協助，優良課本亦未能編訂，而民衆自覺性又未予提高。遂使熱鬧一時之小先生制識字運動，闇然無色。筆者當時適在某師範學校，身歷共事，深感此法為推行識字運動之捷徑，後來所以闇然無色，掩旗息鼓者，非因方法之不美，乃爲各界各地之不力為推　也。因爲利用小先生去推行識字運動，不但省却許多人力與物力，而且是眞正打入人間去的運動，民衆可以免去對工作上的妨碍，與時間上的損失，當然就誠心悅意來接受誠字。這種民衆自覺的接受與要求，才是民衆敎育的眞正的成功。故筆者不陸舊調重彈，提出這個名副其實的民衆識字運動的捷徑－小先　制度。以上所舉，不過犖犖大者，或爲陳舊之理論，或屬前人之舊式，由於我們的社會及國家太糟了，故筆者不願標異立新，但求能做到上述敬端，已是國族前途的曙光了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">How Citizens Should Cooperatively Maintain Public Order <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The military police of our friendly nation, Japan, are known to be more rigorous and attentive to detail in all aspects, including troop organization, structure, knowledge, and training, than those of ordinary countries. This is generally acknowledged by those familiar with the Japanese army. Therefore, the characteristics of the Japanese military police can be described as "impartial" and "solemn." Currently, the Japanese military police in the various areas of the occupied zone are particularly focused on the principle of "impartiality." We understand that the Japanese military police force in Shanghai, in addition to their duties as military police, also shoulder important responsibilities in all areas of politics, economy, and defense, such as guarding the peace, investigating traitors, suppressing terror, and eliminating reactionaries, while always maintaining a "just" demeanor.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Shanghai's public order has gradually been established, leading to stability, and terrorist cases have gradually decreased, even to the point of disappearing. Of course, most of the credit should be attributed to the efforts of the friendly nation's military police force and other security agencies. However, in the process of the military police carrying out their duties, some cases may involve minor misunderstandings due to language barriers and differences in customs. At the same time, it is also unavoidable that this causes fear among the people. We believe that both sides should frankly acknowledge this fact, because only with frank acknowledgment can we have the courage to improve and correct the situation, and completely eliminate misunderstandings.</p>
<p>In our editorial on May 25th, titled "A Request to the Local Authorities of a Friendly Nation," we briefly offered our humble opinions. On May 2nd and May 24th, the authorities of the friendly nation's military police issued statements saying: "In this city, there are often unscrupulous individuals who impersonate members of the Japanese military police force and collude to coerce innocent citizens, extorting money. In the four months from the beginning of this year to the end of April, a total of twenty-seven cases of impersonation and fraud were solved, involving thirty-six criminals, of whom twenty-three were Chinese and thirteen were Japanese and other nationals, all of whom have been severely punished. In the future, if citizens feel that someone is fabricating the name of a military policeman or a military police informant and engaging in illegal activities, they should immediately report it to the nearest military police station for arrest. We hope that the Chinese and Japanese people will warn each other and cooperate in cracking down on these activities, in order to achieve the goal of building a bright and prosperous Shanghai." Based on the main points of the statement, we suggest that if citizens encounter inquiries from the military police, they should not panic, but respond honestly, and the truth will be easily clarified. If they believe that the person is suspicious, they should not be afraid of getting involved and report the facts to the nearest military police station. It is essential to understand that this is a necessary action to cooperate with the military police authorities in cracking down on unscrupulous elements. We believe that many citizens do not have enough knowledge of the military police force, remain ignorant of the situation, and, under the "fear of getting involved" mentality, are willing to remain silent. As a result, this will only encourage the rise of unscrupulous elements, thus obstructing the thorough crackdowns by the military police authorities.</p>
<p>Five months have passed since then. Although we have not seen any formal announcement from the military police authorities regarding whether cases of impersonation and extortion have been eliminated, there are still rumors in society about such incidents. Therefore, in addition to upholding our previous suggestions, we would like to further emphasize and supplement our observations as follows:</p>
<p>First, if a citizen is summoned by the military police for questioning due to an incident or implication, it is because the military police are acting on some intelligence or report, and will not randomly disturb people. Therefore, it is necessary to have a very accurate understanding of this. And pay attention to the following:</p>
<p>If there are inquiries, absolutely tell the truth, without any falsehood or pretense.</p>
<p>Do not panic or be afraid, accept the treatment, and after a considerable period of inquiry and investigation, if it is found that you are innocent, you will be released. Do not be deceived by a few unscrupulous elements and use bribes. Those who offer bribes must feel guilty, which will make things worse. The more urgently they offer bribes, the more difficult it will be to be released.</p>
<p>If you are innocent, but have been falsely accused; or have been unjustly framed by a small number of Chinese staff for extortion, you can report the facts to the military police at any time. Although we have not seen the military police announce any cases of false accusations resulting in the accuser being punished, we believe that the military police, in their sincerity to request citizens' cooperation in cracking down on impersonation and extortion, will definitely severely punish such cases once they are reported.</p>
<p>Second, although terrorist cases have decreased, almost to the point of disappearing, we must not be negligent because of this, but be vigilant at all times. This is the responsibility of every citizen. Because if an unintentional case occurs, all the areas around it will suffer. Therefore, in order to protect the safety of your own residence, you must help to eliminate the activities of the unwilling elements.</p>
<p>Third, to prevent the infiltration of unscrupulous elements, we suggest that the military police authorities should strengthen contact with the Baojia chiefs in various areas to obtain their full cooperation. Because the Baojia chiefs are more familiar with the movements of the residents in their Baojia area. Those who come to Shanghai from other places should apply for registration with the Baojia office, and after the Baojia office forwards the report to the military police, they should closely investigate the actions of the new residents to prevent the infiltration of unscrupulous elements.</p>
<p>In conclusion, maintaining the tranquility of social order is a common requirement and a common responsibility of the authorities and the citizens, and it must be promoted through joint cooperation.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Clarify the Fundamental Goals of the Liberation War in Response to Questions in the House of Representatives Budget Committee <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, October 27th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Nakajima, a member of the Japanese House of Representatives, raised the following questions at the general meeting of the House of Representatives Budget Committee on October 27th: Now that the United Kingdom and the United States have been driven out of Greater East Asia, in order to ensure the autonomy of the southern ethnic groups based on the spirit of "Hakkō ichiu" (eight corners of the world under one roof), the following six principles should be followed to ensure the autonomous state of Greater East Asia:</p>
<p>Eliminate racial discrimination.</p>
<p>Ethnic equality and mutual concession.</p>
<p>Implement economic cooperation based on reciprocity.</p>
<p>Develop and communicate culture.</p>
<p>Liberate resources.</p>
<p>Jointly defend Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>In response, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu replied as follows: The construction of Greater East Asia is based on the voluntary cooperation of the ethnic groups, so the spirit of mutual understanding must be the guideline. This is not only limited to Greater East Asia, but should also be applied to the world. Following this, Mr. Nakajima further questioned: After thoroughly making the countries of the world recognize the significance of Greater East Asia and Japan's war objectives, the United Kingdom and the United States will immediately lose their war objectives and abandon their weapons... The National Government...</p>
<p>East Asians Must Protect Their Homeland and Gain Liberation. Regarding the establishment of a freely elected government, the United Kingdom may also issue empty promises. However, the liberation of India must still be achieved through the struggle of the Indians themselves. East Asia is the homeland of the East Asians, and the fundamental place for the East Asians to live. Therefore, we cannot but defend this homeland. In this war, the United Kingdom and the United States are attempting to overwhelm Japan with economic and military force. If Japan cannot complete its mission, Greater East Asia will inevitably be subjected to the oppression of the United Kingdom and the United States again. Therefore, liberating East Asia from the invading iron hooves of the enemy is also the objective of this war. The coexistence and co-prosperity of Greater East Asia is the coexistence and co-prosperity of the world. East Asia is willing to contribute to all countries in the world by broadly communicating culture, eliminating racial discrimination, and promoting the spirit of mutual understanding and reciprocity. Because we have such a noble spirit, we also have an unwavering belief in victory. In ancient times, few imperialists who violated justice succeeded, except for the Opium War. The American War of Independence was a war launched by the Americans to defend their homeland, and the ultimate victor was because of its spirit rather than its weapons. What the Greater East Asian nations are asking for is only coexistence and co-prosperity, mutual benefit and mutual concession. Those who fight with this spirit are the true appearance of today's Greater East Asia.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Government Proposals Approved by Both Houses, Each Committee Begins Constructive Discussion <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, October 27th (Central News Agency) - The second day of the 83rd Extraordinary Session of the Japanese Diet. The House of Representatives and the House of Peers have completed deliberation of the bills submitted by the government, exchanged them, and the supplementary budget has also been passed by the House of Representatives and sent to the House of Peers. On the last day of the Diet (28th), it is scheduled to pass all 14 legal bills and 3 budget bills. On October 27th, the House of Peers submitted the Industrial Property Rights Bill, the Military Service Law Revision Bill, the Air Defense Law, the Court Composition Law, and other four bills for voting in turn, and then submitted them to the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives submitted the Accounting Resolution, the Wartime Special Law Amendment Bill, and other five bills to the Special Committee for deliberation. The House of Representatives also focused on the Budget General Assembly and the Military Supplies Company Law Committee, and each committee engaged in substantive discussions throughout the day, focusing on government policies and conducting constructive discussions. Prime Minister Tojo and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu clarified the fundamental significance of the Greater East Asia War and the concept of the Greater East Asia War construction at the Budget General Assembly. Commerce Minister Kishi explained the scope of application and operating principles of the Military Supplies Company Law at the Special Committee. Then all the bill drafts and the three budget bills were discussed, and they were successively proposed and passed at the plenary meeting, and submitted to the House of Peers. In addition, the six legal bills submitted by the House of Peers were also urgently proposed and passed at the plenary meeting and sent to the committee for deliberation. Therefore, the House of Peers will conduct further deliberation on the 28th.</p>
<p>Tokyo, October 27th (Central News Agency) - The main content of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives on the 27th and the answers are as follows: Prime Minister Tojo answered questions regarding administrative operations, saying that the plan to transfer the affairs of central government officials to local government offices is to transfer all affairs of central departments to local governments, except for special cases, and the central office only undertakes planning and guidance. Also, the decisions of the local council chairmen must be approved by the minister in charge of the local administration before direct instructions can be given. Prime Minister Tojo answered questions regarding the establishment of the Ministry of Military Supplies, saying that increasing national power and strengthening production, especially increasing the production rate of aircraft, is important. The establishment of the Ministry of Military Supplies will make the relationship between the command headquarters and the state production more compact, and will actively promote it under the form of private ownership and private operation. Minister of Agriculture Yamasaki answered questions regarding food self-sufficiency, saying that the plan for food self-sufficiency for next year is under careful consideration. It is roughly planned to improve nearly one million mu of land in Japan, and it is expected to increase by five million koku by the 20th year of Showa (1945). In addition, increased production will also be carried out in Korea and Taiwan, and Manchuria has also established an active production increase plan. The Prime Minister answered questions regarding the conscription of women, saying that it is not planned to conscript women today, but it is possible in the future. The work of conscripting women is very important, and simply imitating foreign countries will destroy the family system. For the sake of national victory, it is necessary to do everything possible, but it is currently not planned to conscript women.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Manchurian Government Expresses Its Views <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Xinjing, October 27th (Central News Agency) - The government of Manchukuo expressed the following views regarding Prime Minister Tojo's speech at the Extraordinary Diet session: Prime Minister Tojo once again taught the unwavering belief in defeating the United Kingdom and the United States at this Diet session. He also stated that Japan will never internationally interfere with the progress of Greater East Asia's joint construction. It will strive to realize all agreements made with the various groups. Recently, Burma and the Philippines have successively gained independence, and the Provisional Government of India has also been established. All of these are realizations of the Prime Minister's promises. Therefore, the total power of Greater East Asia is becoming stronger. The Prime Minister specifically mentioned Manchukuo's material and spiritual cooperation in completing the war and expressed his gratitude. Manchukuo's contribution to the Greater East Asia War is in recognizing that only by winning the final victory in the Greater East Asia War can Greater East Asia be liberated, and Manchukuo can thus realize its permanent development. In the future, Manchukuo will strive to fulfill the two major missions of defending the north and strengthening its combat power.</p>

<p>Berlin, October 27th (Central News Agency) - According to the Haitong News Agency, a German military spokesman said yesterday that the large-scale offensive by the Soviet troops between the Sea of Azov and Krivoy Rog shows that the enemy's headquarters is determined to achieve a decisive result as much as possible. The battles from the Dnieper River bend to the Sea of Azov are expected to last for quite some time. The spokesman declined to predict when the war would end and said that the current battles on the Eastern Front are far more important than those on other fronts.</p>
<p>Berlin, October 27th (Central News Agency) - According to the Haitong News Agency, Soviet troops in the southern part of the Eastern Front are attacking southward and westward, and the German forces continue to resist stubbornly. The Soviet pressure on the Nogai Steppe and Krivoy Rog is very strong. The Soviet troops southwest of Melitopol are fiercely attacking the Genichesk Isthmus in an attempt to break through the German defenses, but after fierce fighting the day before, the Soviet troops were repelled. Fierce fighting occurred on October 21st in the Dnieper River estuary. The German troops who withdrew from Dnepropetrovsk have strengthened the eastern flank of the defenses protecting Krivoy Rog, and fierce fighting continued throughout the day.</p>
<p>Berlin, October 27th (Central News Agency) - The German High Command announced at noon on the 26th: The fighting in the Melitopol area and southeast of Chaplinka in the southern part of the Eastern Front was the most intense on the 25th. The enemy forces attacked repeatedly, but were resisted after fierce fighting, and the German forces have repelled the enemy forces that broke into the defensive positions. There is still fierce fighting on the side of the Dnieper River bend. After destroying all important military facilities, the German troops have withdrawn from Dnepropetrovsk. The Soviet troops attacking Krivoy Rog have redeployed new elite troops and have engaged in continuous fierce fighting north of the city several times, but have not yet broken through the German defenses. According to the military, a tank force launched a counterattack on the flank of the Soviet troops from the northwest and broke into the enemy positions in order to relieve the German troops fighting in Krivoy Rog. Also, Soviet troops launched an offensive from the bridgehead northwest of Crimea with strong forces. The German troops immediately counterattacked and repelled them. In several locations southeast of Kiev, north of Kiev, and north of Chernigov, local skirmishes broke out. The German troops repelled the enemy forces in all locations. West of Krichev, Soviet troops launched an offensive along a wide front with several infantry divisions. However, after the German forces launched a fierce counterattack, they repelled the enemy units that had broken through in several locations to the points before the offensive began. There were only small-scale skirmishes west of Smolensk and south of Velikiye Luki.</p>
<p>The Strategic Importance of Krivoy Rog</p>
<p>Berlin, October 27th (Central News Agency) - The German High Command announced its battle report on the 26th. The German troops have withdrawn from Dnepropetrovsk, which proves that the Soviet troops have significantly increased pressure in that area, and also shows the importance of the battle situation. Chaplinka and Dnepropetrovsk are located at the north and south ends of the Dnieper River bend, and are two major strategic strongholds. Therefore, the German troops had previously built strong defensive positions in these two locations. The Soviet troops concentrated their elite forces to attack these locations. They occupied Chaplinka on the left bank of the river on the 14th of this month, and now they have occupied Dnepropetrovsk, and are bound to advance past the Dnieper River bend towards the Ingulets River, which will lead to a major situation for the German troops that has not been seen since the beginning of the war. Also, the Soviet troops attacking Krivoy Rog from Crimea are threatening the German flank, so in order to avoid unnecessary damage, the German troops must concentrate on forming a firm defensive posture towards the mouths of the Dnieper and Ingulets Rivers. Krivoy Rog is the center of the Ukrainian iron and steel industry, and is also a transportation hub and an extremely important strategic stronghold for the German troops in the Ukrainian area, so the German troops are currently working hard to defend the area. The German and Soviet troops in the Krivoy Rog area are bound to engage in fierce offensive and defensive battles. Also, the Soviet troops in Krichev, south of Smolensk, have also dispatched elite reserve troops to launch an operation threatening the north of Gomel. In this area, the salient of the Soviet battle line is almost a straight line from north to south. If one place is breached, it will affect the entire line, so the German troops are currently making every effort to defend it. At the same time, the German's excellent mechanized units are launching a flanking attack on the Soviet troops in the Krivoy Rog area to prevent the Soviet advance. Therefore, the trends in the battle situation in the past few days will have a major impact on the battle situation at the end of this year, and are worthy of attention.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Fierce Battles on the Nujiang River: Japanese Troops Reach the West Bank, Japanese Aircraft Bomb Burmese Roads <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 27th (Central News Agency telegram) – Elite Japanese troops launched a blitzkrieg against the defending Chinese forces on the west bank of the Nujiang River, forcing them to retreat to the east bank, completely seizing their crossing points. The Chongqing Military Council's announcement on the 22nd also acknowledged this, stating that the Yunnan troops' fierce resistance against the Japanese for a week had resulted in a retreat. Currently, Japanese troops have reached the west bank of the Nujiang River, poised to cross and advance eastward.</p>
<p>A certain Japanese military base (Central News Agency telegram) – On the 25th, Japanese army air units, in large formations, launched a surprise attack on Xiaguan, a key point on the Yunnan-Burma Road in the southern part of Yunnan. They heavily bombed military installations south of the city, causing major fires, after which the entire air unit safely returned to base.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 27th (Central News Agency telegram) – The war on the Nujiang front has attracted considerable attention in the United States. Correspondents from the American news agency reported on the success of the Japanese operations and the precarious situation of the Chongqing forces, causing great shock to Americans. When a special correspondent from the Sino-American News Agency attempted to cross to the opposite bank of the crossing point at Liuku, they first subjected the Chongqing forces to heavy artillery fire, then launched a surprise attack from Xishan Road, seizing the area. This location is situated 80 miles directly north of the Huitong Bridge on the Yunnan-Burma Road and is a strategically important point. The Japanese operation's goal is to encircle and thoroughly annihilate the Chongqing forces on the west bank of the Nujiang River. Furthermore, a correspondent from the United Press reported that the Chongqing forces' positions on all four banks of the Nujiang River had been completely surrounded by Japanese forces. The fighting is now progressing within rifle range of the Chongqing forces on the east bank of the Nujiang River, and recently Japanese artillery has been positioned on the high ground on all four banks of the Nujiang River, bombarding the Chongqing forces' positions from above. The Nujiang River has a very rapid current, with steep cliffs on both sides reaching an altitude of 3,000 feet. It takes a full day for Chongqing aircraft to cross the Nujiang River from the Yunnan-Burma Road. After the Japanese occupied Yunliang and Sibu, the Zhuan Tong Bridge and the Shuanghong Bridge, 40 miles north of it, on the Yunnan-Burma Road were destroyed by Chongqing forces. Afterwards, Chongqing forces only utilized small crossing points to gradually move to the west bank. The current Japanese operation aims to eliminate these Chongqing ferry positions and further advance to the Lushui area, several hundred miles west of Longling, to control the 90-mile stretch of land along the west bank of the Nujiang River.</p>
<p>A certain Japanese military base on the Burmese Front, 27th (Central News Agency telegram) – At 2:00 PM on the 26th, 25 enemy B-24 type bombers attacked Yangon. The Japanese army's elite fighter squadron scrambled to intercept them, shooting down three and severely damaging five others, inflicting a fatal blow on the enemy. Two of these were rammed by Japanese aircraft, but the Japanese pilots safely parachuted down. Furthermore, the Japanese side suffered no damage.</p>

<p>Shonan, 27th (Central News Agency telegram) – Japanese Southern Expeditionary Army Information Minister Nakajima gave a speech on the 27th regarding the Greater East Asia War situation: The announcement by the Okamura unit regarding the recent war situation in the South Pacific and Burmese border areas has completely refuted the lies propagated by the enemy in recent months about the decline in Japanese combat power and defensive tactics. It also clarified that Japanese tactics are constantly in an offensive position both in local battles and in overall operational guidance. Regarding the truth of the fighting in the South Pacific, in short, the enemy is recklessly sacrificing one ton of bombs per square yard, wandering aimlessly along worthless battle lines. In the battles near Lae and Salamaua, according to later reports, the enemy has indeed lost more than 20,000 troops, and the enemy further believes that continuing this difficult jungle exploration will lead to Tokyo, which is a truly ridiculous idea. The Axis forces' attempt to seize Burma was broken by Japan's preemptive offensive.</p>

The fundamental revision of the Japan-China Basic Treaty has long been anticipated by people from all walks of life in China, so now that they have learned that it will soon be realized, everyone is excited.</p>
<h3 id="e17">American Pilots' Arrogant Attitude Causes Resentment Among Chongqing Residents <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai dispatch – The people in the inland areas of Chongqing are expressing deep indignation at the American air force personnel stationed in Chongqing for their tyranny and arrogance. According to recent reports, the depth of popular resentment can be seen from the following: A certain aviation technician in Chongqing, surnamed Yang, recently returned to the peace zone out of strong resentment towards the American air force and dissatisfaction with Chongqing's incompetence. According to what he told a friend surnamed Chen, at the sentry post of the Chongqing army at the Guilin airfield, there was a sign that read: "Foreigners are forbidden from entering the airfield, and violators will be severely punished." He also talked about the arrogance of American pilots when they flew back in their planes, which was unbearable to witness. It is said that as soon as they got off the plane, they lay down on the ground next to the plane to rest, while a Chongqing officer led a team of servants, each holding a fan, to surround the American pilot and fan him. The reclining pilot seemed very comfortable, turning from side to side while singing loudly, exposing the arrogance of Americans without reservation. The Southeast Daily of August 13 criticized the absurd attitude of the Americans, reporting that Lieutenant Colonel Ferrais, an instructor at the Chongqing Artillery School, actually made the outrageous statement: "We intend to create a small-scale America in China." According to a letter recently sent from Kunming by a certain An, "Life in Kunming has become tiring, and I am eager to avoid Kunming. The American's tyrannical behavior, if China and the United States ever have an incident in the future, I will immediately be the vanguard of the action team. This is my way of retaliating against the current leadership of the United States in China, and I have no other way of retaliating against the United States."</p>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency telegram) – James Reston, a famous reporter for the New York Times, reported from a certain American air force base in Chongqing that the pilots of the American air force stationed in Chongqing feel that there is little progress in the war against Japan and that the future is bleak, and they do not know when they will be able to return home. Therefore, they all want to stipulate a certain period of service in Chongqing. Japanese aircraft in China are numerous, and the fuel supply is very sufficient, so the American pilots consider Japan to be an enemy that can last for a long time, and they believe that the engines of Japanese aircraft are extremely good. In the past few months, among the thousands of Japanese aircraft that have flown into the Chongqing territory, none have been forced to land due to engine damage.</p>

<h3 id="e26">Moscow Conference Unlikely to Achieve Satisfactory Results: Observations of a Japanese Military Commentator <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency telegram) – Rear Admiral Zasa Tanji, a retired officer of the Japanese Navy, is a well-known military commentator. He recently commented on the "Relations between the Three Countries of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union." After repeated negotiations, the tripartite talks between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are being held in Moscow, with Molotov, Hull, Eden, and the military leaders of the three countries participating. The reason for holding this meeting is that the Soviet Union did not send a representative to the Ottawa Conference, which prevented things from being resolved thoroughly. Therefore, Britain and the United States advocated convening this meeting, and the Soviet Union was able to seize the leading role in this meeting. The Soviet Union's Pravda newspaper stated its firm position of absolutely refusing to discuss issues such as the Soviet Union's border wars, and then the Soviet News newspaper demanded that the opening of a second European front be the central topic of the meeting. Britain and the United States originally hoped to win over the Soviet Union by offering issues of national borders, so that the Soviet Union would ease its demand to form a second European front. Looking at the trend of Soviet public opinion, Britain and the United States' attempts were met with a head-on blow. According to Britain and the America, the purpose of convening this tripartite conference is to use Italy's unconditional surrender and the resulting changes in the South European war situation to ease the Soviet Union's tough attitude towards Britain and America; the issue of the Mediterranean Committee; the issue of the anti-Axis food conference; and the political and economic issues such as the future borders of the Soviet Union, in order to adjust the long-standing differences of opinion among the three countries. But this is still Britain and America's old and cunning strategy to avoid their own sacrifices, and the Soviet Union sees through this point, and will not easily relax its own claims. Currently, with the war against Germany in full swing, both sides must take consistent steps, so the Soviet Union seems to still have to agree to Britain and America's requests first, and then insist on its own claims even more. In particular, because the Soviet Union's military strength has been greatly depleted, it is now urgent to demand the formation of a second front. Furthermore, Italy's surrender to Britain and the United States has not yielded great gains. Germany's troop strength on the Eastern Front has not been affected by this, and its reserve strength is sufficient to be allocated, and the defense of continental Europe is as solid as a rock. Therefore, the main topic of the tripartite conference held under such circumstances is naturally the decision on the second front. From the Soviet Union's point of view, considering its own interests, it must not be swayed by British and American rhetoric. Especially given the urgency of the current war situation, the Soviet Union will undoubtedly insist on its position, so the result of this meeting will certainly not be satisfactory.</p>

The Axis' forces have extreme Yuanzu in their manpower and material resources, so they can't just carry out small-scale activities in the central Mediterranean.</p>

<p>Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency telegram) – According to a telegram from Rome: The Italian Fascist Republic government announced on the 25th that it had decided to make Venice the capital.</p>
<p>Rome, 27th (Central News Agency telegram) – Havas reports, according to political sources yesterday, Italy will convene a National Conference in November and declare Italy a republic. Hundreds of representatives from both houses and trade unions will participate. The areas represented include some occupied areas. The location of the meeting is still secret, probably a small city in northern Italy. Political figures are in charge of selecting a large city with historic northern Italy as its meeting place, and the government is flattening the area republic, but the 14th-century Sforza Palace destroyed lighter as the capital of the Republic of Venice. Venice has a history of more than a thousand years and is also an ideal country for the first century. Both have been anti-Habsburg centers, so there are anti-German components. Therefore, it is suggested that Bologna is the place where the city has never been controlled by Austria. It has no anti-German history. Therefore, it is suitable for holding this National Conference.</p>

<p>Geneva, 26th (Central News Agency) German News Agency reports: Political commentators from London and the United States predict that Churchill's cabinet is in urgent need of reorganization. After the reorganization, a "Ministry of Reconstruction" will be created, there will be changes in the War Office, and another undersecretary will be promoted to minister. It is widely believed that this reorganization will be implemented before the parliament convenes. According to the commentators, the undersecretaries who will be promoted to ministers include Major Hunterson, Under-Secretary of the Army, Mr. St. Moore, Permanent Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Supply, and Mr. Clark, Under-Secretary of the Home Office.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Japan Strengthens Production Capacity <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>On the Establishment of the Ministry of Munitions</p>
<p>It is a well-known fact that in the current stage of the war, the decisive air battle is becoming increasingly fierce. In the integrated three-dimensional warfare of land, sea, and air, the proportion of aircraft is increasing day by day. Without mastering air supremacy, the supply of sea and land becomes extremely difficult. Moreover, the outcome of ground combat can also be determined by the strength of air power. Therefore, strengthening air power, especially ensuring the quantity of aircraft, is the primary requirement for victory.</p>
<p>Under this situation, there is no need to say that the entire nation should move towards accelerating the production of aircraft with all its strength. Therefore, aircraft production must be the biggest goal of decisive battle production, and ensuring its planned output must be the basic principle of all emergency measures. Expanding and preparing various related industries to plan for the production of tens of thousands of aircraft, in order to achieve this goal, the production scale and capacity of assembly plants, engine plants, propeller plants, and parts plants should be expanded to what extent; the amount of general materials such as special steel, ordinary steel, non-ferrous metals, and chemical products needed; the number of equipment such as various machine tools needed; the amount of labor, electricity, gas, and other power needed, and how to supply them, etc., must be comprehensively planned, and then meticulously considered to establish a pyramid-shaped comprehensive plan. A super-focus production centered on aircraft production must be done in this way. To accomplish this step, there must be a strong comprehensive organization or a single production administrative organization to draft and implement production plans. Therefore, the theory of establishing a Ministry of Munitions (or Ministry of Production) is once again loudly advocated. At the fourth Central Cooperation Conference in the past, Kawamura Kyosuke, Suzuki Shigemitsu, and others also earnestly demanded the unification of the command system and the location of responsibility.</p>
<p>To Complete the Planned Economy, a Single Agency with Absolute Authority Should be Responsible for its Promotion</p>
<p>Japan Strengthens Production Capacity</p>
<p>It is needless to say that production administration and production guidance should be implemented. Based on this reason, Germany established a Central Planning Committee within the Four-Year Plan Bureau, and at the same time, the Ministry of Munitions was enriched with military supplies to realize the powerful one-yuan administration of expanding production. Immediately after the outbreak of the war, the United States destroyed and placed a Wartime Production Board with strong enforcement powers, as well as a planning agency for comprehensive planning of military and civilian production, purchase, and allocation matters; the United Kingdom also maintained direct connection between the Wartime Production Department and the military production agency, measured the production capacity of each factory, and implemented a typical proportional distribution of production. From this, it can be seen that in the major belligerent countries, the unification of wartime production administration is becoming increasingly complete.</p>
<p>However, the adjustment of military and civilian needs is fundamentally a matter of adjusting command and administration, and operations and industry. Since the independence of the command authority is an unshakable principle, we have to admit that the military needs provincial case has its inevitable limitations. Furthermore, if the "ideology of the officials" is not changed, then simply reforming the organization may be difficult to achieve the desired results, and this point must also be considered. Therefore, the plan to reorganize and expand the Planning Yuan to give it the character and function of a substantial economic general staff headquarters is more realistic than the plan to establish a Ministry of Munitions. Although today's Planning Yuan is responsible for drafting plans for material mobilization and other national mobilization, and establishing comprehensive national policies, and there is a close relationship between the two, the latter's function is always relatively weak, and the contact between the planning officials and the implementing officials is difficult to achieve perfectly. To improve this point, it is appropriate to reorganize and expand the Planning Yuan, and to form the "General Affairs Office" with the most outstanding members of the various implementing officials (including the Army and Navy military affairs, equipment, and other relevant agencies) in order to stimulate the complete operation of the economy. At the same time, the Planning Yuan should be responsible for ordering the implementing officials to quickly implement the plans decided by the cabinet meeting. If the reorganized Planning Yuan can be further made a planning agency directly under the headquarters liaison meeting, its effect will be even greater.</p>
<p>Order Control</p>
<p>As mentioned above, although there are various difficulties in realizing the ideal plan for reforming production administration, the transitional production administration stagnation (according to convention, it takes at least half a year for an administrative agency to truly exert its effectiveness) and friction caused by organizational reform pose a danger of unexpected obstacles to the decisive battle production, and this point should also be considered.</p>
<p>As for the realistic aspect of carrying out the planned production, the unification of order issuance and receipt, which has been criticized as the narrow path of production administration, as well as reasonable adjustment and government control, are the minimum requirements that must be realized. Therefore, the more active application of the Special Wartime Administrative Law and the Special Wartime Administrative Power is what we are waiting to see.</p>
<p>Currently, because the orders are issued individually and arbitrarily, the factories that have always been famous have piles of orders, while on the other hand, the factories that are known to be empty are inevitably idle, resulting in the phenomenon that all the equipment owned by the enterprise cannot be fully and rationally utilized. Secondly, the lack of control over orders can hinder the realization of improving the quality and quantity of production by dividing the production fields. Furthermore, the lack of organic connection between the ordering officials and other industrial officials can make the distribution of major and minor materials impossible. Often in the same company's factories, and even in the same factory, there are examples of materials, technicians, and equipment that cannot be used interchangeably.</p>
<p>In this decisive battle stage where production conditions are constantly changing, production administration also needs to be organically responsive to the needs of reality, and it is necessary to quickly implement the allocation and exchange of production factors or mutual accommodation in order to increase the overall production volume. Such elastic economic guidance can only be expected on the basis of order control. Furthermore, in order to standardize and proportionally distribute production on a large scale, it is bound to be restrained and hinder its rapid realization when the issuance of orders is without control.</p>
<p>Regarding the necessity of controlling orders, the opinions of the military, government, and civilians have already been unified. In the shipbuilding industry, the unification of issuing orders has already been realized, and great success has been achieved in implementing shipbuilding plans.</p>
<p>Regarding rolling mills, a rolling mill committee with the Minister of Commerce and Industry as the chairman has also been established; as for machine tools for aircraft, a committee composed of the Army, Navy, and Ministry of Commerce and Industry has also been established to closely contact the control association and prepare to promote order control and plan this production. Furthermore, special steel, which is closely related to the production of aircraft and other weapons, recently established a special steel production increase liaison council jointly organized by the Army, Navy, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and the Steel Control Association in the central government, and a continuous liaison council composed of steel plants, steel control association branch supervisors, and public works officials at the local level, giving comprehensive and production administration to the operation.</p>
<p>Order control must overcome its difficulties and advance step by step in accordance with the current requirements of decisive battle production, so this time the "domestic potential enhancement policy" also "aims to unify the military and official voices on the procurement of important production."

<h3 id="e39">Woolen Fabrics, Biji, and Other Woolen Knitted Goods from Three Provinces and Two Cities Approved for Free Transfer; Regulations for Management of Gauze and Cloth Distribution to be Stipulated Soon <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The Shanghai Wool Textile Factory Association stated that although woolen yarn, woolen fabric, biji, camel wool, and other woolen knitted goods are listed as major commodities in the three provinces and two cities, they are not among the prohibited materials, so their transfer should be free. The Ministry of Industry has already made clear statements on this matter. However, police officers, due to a lack of understanding of the situation, often obstruct the transfer. Therefore, the National Commercial Control Association specially sent a letter to the General Police Bureau of this city yesterday, instructing all subordinate police stations to allow free transfer in the future and not to interfere, in order to ease the difficulties of merchants.</p>
<p>After the government officially ordered the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, the relevant industries have applied for capital for the existing yarn and cloth as scheduled. According to reporters from the Shanghai News Agency, the authorities will soon stipulate and implement regulations for the distribution and management of cotton yarn. The relevant industry associations, such as the yarn and cloth industry, must base their opinions on the application for distribution and management on the categorized statistical table of the sales volume applied for by the members of each relevant industry association. A special application form will be distributed to each member, requiring them to fill in the correct quantity of cotton yarn to be sold in the form within a limited time and submit it to the association for reference. The form issued by the yarn and cloth industry is named "Application Form for Sales Quantity of Cotton Yarn." The items to be filled in are the number of pieces of yarn to be sold, the receipt number of the application to be purchased, the number of packages to be reserved, and remarks.</p>

<p>The distribution of edible oil in this city has been handled by the Shanghai Edible Oil Association Wholesale Office. The Oil and Grain Professional Committee of the Commercial Control Association has now been established, and its internal organizational structure is also sound. Therefore, the Commercial Control Association has authorized the committee to continue to handle the distribution of edible oil. According to Chen Zili, the chairman of the committee, the oil and grain procurement and distribution plan has been drafted and submitted to the Shanghai Office of the Material Control Review Committee for review and approval, and then submitted to the review meeting of the committee for approval, it can be implemented. As for the distribution method in this city, the committee will cooperate with the Municipal Grain Bureau and the authorities of the two districts to explore the rice and grain distribution method to avoid malpractices, and will implement the takeover from November. The quantity can be increased day by day.</p>
<p>Full Purchase of Oil and Grain with Equal Funding from China and Japan</p>
<p>The subordinate organizations of the Oil and Grain Professional Committee have been basically completed and will begin full procurement from the middle of next month. The funds for the procurement of oil and grain are loaned equally by Chinese and Japanese banks. If the funds are insufficient, the Central Reserve will make up for it. The purchasing merchants entrusted by the Japanese side have also been roughly determined to be Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Daimaru, Sanko, Shiraki Jitsugyo, Yinghua Ichigun, and Yokoyama, etc. The purchasing areas include Nanjing, Hangzhou, Wuhu, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Jiaxing, Nantong, and other places. The types of oil and grain purchased this year are wide-ranging, including miscellaneous grains such as soybeans, green beans, sorghum, and corn, as well as oilseeds such as rice, peanuts, tung oil seeds, sesame seeds, and rapeseed, as well as livestock bones.</p>

<p>In order to ensure the health of citizens, the Municipal Health Bureau has set up a quarantine station in the Shanghai Livestock Market to conduct inspections of fresh pork, beef, mutton, and other meats sold in the market, in order to maintain the hygiene of the meat. However, chickens, ducks, wild game, and other items are often sold directly on the market without going through the market, which allows diseased or dead chickens, ducks, and rancid wild game to be mixed into the market for sale. If citizens purchase and consume them without knowing it, it will seriously affect their health. Therefore, the bureau specially consulted the various police bureaus yesterday, instructing all police stations to strictly ban poultry that has not been inspected and has not obtained an inspection certificate.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Third Police Bureau Employs Four Commissioners; Already Started Working <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>

In addition, several general secretaries are stationed in the offices of the Baojia Committee in various districts, engaging in planning and promoting Baojia work. The current Baojia promotion situation in the office is still consistently promoting Baojia. The director, Fang Jian, is currently planning to organize a training class for personnel engaged in Baojia work, and holding weekly military discussions, broadcasting speeches, and issuing Baojia special reports. When possible, we will also create a film and drama of Baojia movement, so that the general public has a deeper understanding of the Baojia organization."</p>

<p>Small Launches That Have Not Applied for Licenses</p>
<p>The measurement and inspection of small launches under 20 tons, as well as registration and license issuance, have always been carried out by the Navigation Administration Bureau, which submits the applications of various shipping companies to the ministry for the issuance of small launch registration licenses. After the incident, due to special circumstances, it was temporarily impossible for the bureau to handle it uniformly, which caused disputes in authority from time to time, and the shipping companies also had difficulties in knowing where to turn. Subsequently, after repeated negotiations with the relevant authorities on the issue of the authority, the bureau began to handle all measurement, inspection, registration, and license issuance matters uniformly from the beginning of this year, so as to unify the authority. At the same time, the shipping companies were notified of the transportation licenses. Recently, some of these shipping companies have been able to abide by the law and apply for measurement and inspection and license issuance, while others have been waiting to see and attempting to evade and take advantage of the situation. In order to exercise its authority and protect merchants and travelers, the bureau has decided to uniformly ban the business of small launches that have not applied for measurement and inspection registration licenses, and prevent their navigation, and has informed the Jianghai Customs not to issue customs clearance.</p>

<p>The Times reported: According to most economic observers yesterday, after the Western District and a part of Zhabei were merged into the First District, the implementation of price controls and other economic strategies should follow the same economic policies implemented in the former International Settlement area as stipulated by the former Municipal Council and the First District Public Office after August 1. However, it has been found that this is not the case as expected. The unification of the Shanghai administrative system should first be implemented in the economic aspect, and it is especially necessary to implement the same economic policies in the Western District and a part of Zhabei as in the former International Settlement area. The measures that should be implemented in the newly incorporated areas are as follows: shops should clearly mark the prices of goods in the windows, and fresh milk and other canned foods and daily necessities should be sold at official prices. Hoarding and refusal to sell goods by shops should be punished, and other important official announcements should also be implemented. Food prices, especially in the Western District, are particularly high. It is generally hoped that controls should be implemented immediately to stabilize people's livelihoods. Authoritative observers have called on the authorities to take firm steps to expand the scope of economic control policies to the entire city.</p>

<p>Central News Agency: After the restoration of the concessions, the municipal government was determined to rigorously ban gambling in the urban area in order to establish a new Shanghai. Last month, it ordered the closure of all opium dens in the First District. The Central Hotel and Shennan Hotel in the district, which were originally places where opium was publicly sold and people were allowed to smoke, were also ordered to prohibit the sale and smoking of opium last month. However, it has been found that the above mentioned sites of the Central Hotel and Shennan Hotel have revived and openly defied the municipal government's orders, selling opium and allowing people to smoke. At a time when the rigorous anti-opium and anti-gambling movement is in full swing, the general public hopes that the relevant authorities will effectively ban it in order to achieve the effectiveness of completely banning opium and gambling.</p>

<p>Then, an auction of a charity ball was held, and Mr. Zhou, a great philanthropist, purchased it for 40,000 yuan. As the finale began, the Sha Sijin brothers of Xi Qing both scored points, while Yu Yuzi and Wang Chuqing of Ren Yu followed suit, resulting in a tie. Both sides were cautious, and the score remained within one or two points. Ren Yu led 13 to 12 at the lemon time. After the break, Yu Yuzi of Xi Qing made repeated shots, and the score soared. Xi Qing tried to recover, resulting in a 19 to 19 tie, the second draw. Ye Long of Xi Qing wasted opportunities with wild shots, giving Ren Yu a chance.

<p>The Paradise of Wandering</p>
<h3 id="e60">The Happy Life of Children at the Shanghai Fu You Orphanage <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The children in this paradise for wandering children—the Shanghai Fu You Orphanage—can truly be said to be fortunate. They have completely broken away from the miserable lives of being abandoned, bullied, and insulted in the past and have embarked on a path of brightness and self-reliance. Under the guidance of their teachers, the children will now determine their own destiny.</p>
<p>Mr. Dong Bin said that since the orphanage was established in January of the 31st year of the Republic of China until now (October of the 32nd year), it has taken in a total of 375 wandering refugees and orphaned children. Among them, those who had previously studied and had relatively good grades and character were adopted by respectable people in society or taken back by their own families. Currently, there are 228 children remaining in the orphanage, 161 boys and 67 girls. About 40% of them are street children sent by various public organizations, newspapers, and kind people, and about 40% are orphans. The rest are children of hard-working laborers who have relatives but are actually unable to raise and educate their children, as well as apprentices who have escaped from abuse, etc. However, Mr. Dong Bin said correctly: "There are still countless wandering children and suffering children in society who urgently need to be rescued and educated."</p>
<p>After the children enter the Shanghai Fu You Orphanage, they naturally no longer have to worry about going hungry. When it was first established, it was stipulated that there would be one meal and two congees per day. The average daily consumption of rice was about 150 jin, and miscellaneous grains (including red beans, corn flour, wheat grits, sweet potatoes, and flour) were about 50 jin. In terms of vegetables, 4 jin of oil and about 120 jin of vegetables were used daily. Purchasing, cooking, and distribution were all handled by the teachers and the children themselves. The kitchen was so lively, with some washing, some sweeping, some lighting the fire, and some weighing. The allocation of food was based on the age and physique of the children, and they were divided into more than ten groups, each with different portions of food to suit their individual nutritional needs without wasting a single bit. However, the actual daily food supply was still somewhat insufficient for children who were developing, strictly speaking. With no other choice, they could only temporarily add an extra meal once a week and try their best to add an extra serving of vegetables once.</p>
<p>In addition to providing food, special attention was paid to the children's health and hygiene. All children sent to the orphanage for admission had to first go to Dr. Hu Qipeng at the hospital for examination. For the sake of the health of all the children in the orphanage, children with infectious diseases were not admitted. The health status of the children at the time of admission, as well as their special nutritional needs, were recorded in detail as a basis for future grouping, classification, and food allocation. Most of them were malnourished before admission, so they had to be given richer food when they first entered the orphanage. After a certain period of time, they would share the same food as the general students. If students in the orphanage were found to be ill, they would be treated by the orphanage. There was a medical room and ward in the orphanage, and a nurse was specially hired to be responsible for all medical affairs in the orphanage. Dr. Zhang Xiqi, an ophthalmologist, and Dr. Chen Zhanyuan, a dentist, were specially invited to visit the orphanage for examinations on a regular basis. If there were serious illnesses, they would be sent to the Zhenxin Infectious Disease Hospital and the Shandeshe for treatment. Special attention was paid to hygiene and cleanliness, and all teachers and staff worked closely together to supervise and assist in the children's bathing, changing clothes, washing, mending, haircuts, nail trimming, cold and heat care, and comforting of illnesses. Therefore, the orphanage students were able to prevent diseases before they occurred and maintain a healthy state. Not only had there been no deaths since its establishment, but also no serious illnesses or infectious disease emergencies had occurred.</p>
<p>Although the residences were old-fashioned houses, the antique architecture had adopted more modern construction methods, so the air and light were very good. The second floor served as a dormitory, with separate rooms for boys and girls, each accommodating more than ten to twenty people, each with a tutor in charge of supervision. Because they were all on the ground floor, special attention was paid to tidiness and cleanliness, and the floors were as smooth as desk surfaces.</p>
<p>Military-style management and family-style care—we envy the lives of these lucky ones among the suffering children.</p>
<p>Teaching, Learning, and Doing</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fu You Orphanage implements a system that combines teaching, learning, and doing in the education of the wandering and suffering children it takes in. In addition to imparting the knowledge necessary for life to these children, they also pay attention to their character and habits. They are required to master one skill every six months, laying the foundation for their future self-reliance and livelihood.</p>
<p>Elementary School System. According to actual needs, courses are formulated. Vice President Dong said that although it has not been established for long, the general academic performance at the end of the semester actually exceeds the level of ordinary elementary schools of the same grade. In learning, boys and girls study together without separate classrooms. Currently, the number of students in the first and second grades is the largest, exceeding more than half of the students in the entire orphanage. Therefore, there is a particularly great need for assistance from others in terms of education.</p>
<p>Starting from the third grade, in order to cultivate their collective activities and life skills, a work-study program is implemented. They still attend classes as usual every morning, and time is set aside for work in the afternoon. The work is temporarily divided into four parts: carpentry (carving), now limited to carving plaques and couplets due to various practical restrictions. Some school furniture, such as student desks and chairs, are also made by the students themselves. Minor repairs to school furniture are not entrusted to outsiders. Painting, including the preparation of various colored paints and the implementation of painting work, etc., is also mainly for learning and has not yet reached the stage of productive practical work. Shoe making, teaching the techniques of sewing cloth and leather shoes, so that they can support themselves after leaving the orphanage in the future. The shoes used by the orphanage students are also mostly sewn by themselves. Gardening, in addition to learning techniques such as planting, irrigation, cultivation, and harvesting, it is also planned to supplement the orphanage students' food with part of the harvest in the future. The campus is currently being developed, and vegetable seedlings have been planted in several places. There are also two piglets being raised in the corner of the garden.</p>
<p>In order to carry out basic life skills education, they specially hire technicians such as carpenters, shoemakers, and tailors to work closely with the teachers and staff to promote a scientific and rational education plan. In addition to formal academic subjects and work subjects, the orphanage students' extracurricular activities are also closely and cordially attended to. From the class teachers of each grade, the work instructors of each subject, to the supervising teachers of each dormitory, everyone cooperates with each other to create a good learning environment, so that these more than two hundred children from all over the world, who have experienced wandering and suffering, naturally lose their bad habits and gradually embark on a bright and correct path in collective life.</p>
<p>Self-Sufficiency, Self-Help, and Self-Governance</p>
<p>After class, the children are lively breathing fresh air on campus, each full of energy and high spirits. Who would have thought that not long ago, they were street children with dirty faces crying for help?</p>
<p>The children's current life, clothing, food, housing, and education are all provided by the orphanage. Look, they are all wearing brand-new blue cloth uniforms and clean shoes and socks. It is said that these are all sewn by themselves. Originally, the organizers of the orphanage, in order to cultivate the children's habits of hard work and endurance, only hired two workers in the orphanage, and all other daily life activities were led by the teachers and staff to carry out children's work, implementing self-sufficiency and self-help. They also organized a "Children's Self-Governance Guidance Committee" to cultivate the children's spirit of self-governance.</p>
<p>The children get up at 6:00 a.m. every day. In addition to washing themselves, they must also clean the dormitory and the entire orphanage. Morning exercises and morning meetings start at 7:00 a.m., and classes start at 9:00 a.m. Middle and high school students start work classes in the afternoon. When learning refined techniques, everyone listens attentively and carefully observes every movement of the technicians, while imitating and practicing. After becoming proficient, and during various simpler tasks, the children are just like formal laborers and soldiers, singing and doing, full of fun. The teachers and technicians also work together, teaching, learning, and doing, completely integrated into one.</p>
<p>The children's automatically organized Fu You Life Mutual Aid Association is divided into four sections: Inspection Section, which organizes patrol groups and tribunals. Any disputes between students, or problems related to learning and work, are resolved by the students themselves. The order of learning and work is also maintained by the students themselves. Academic Section: There is a publishing house, which compiles a bulletin board "Fu You News," as well as a lecture group and a library. Entertainment Section, divided into arts group, singing group, table tennis team, and sports group. Hygiene Section, divided into cleaning, care, and cooking groups. All affairs are solved by the children themselves.</p>

<h3 id="e61">The Economy of the Entire Society in the Economic World <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Modern advanced countries take the economy of the entire society as the premise for all their legislation. What is meant by the "economy of the entire society?" It is to seek the welfare of the entire society, especially when a few people become rich during the war, while the majority of the people have fallen into poverty and hardship. Anything that affects the welfare of the entire people and the lives of the masses must be dealt with in both passive and active ways to find solutions. Everything from the fixing of food prices during wartime, the rationing of daily necessities, the reduction of the people's living burden, the planning of the people's residential safety, to the government's obligation to provide grain to its people in the event of famine, is related to the welfare of the entire society, which is the so-called "economy of the entire society" problem. Therefore, the economic laws and regulations of wartime countries are so strict because they are aimed at winning the country's victory abroad and maintaining social security at home.</p>
<p>We are aware that the welfare of the entire society is the economy of the entire society, so we believe that social welfare issues are the premise of wartime economic issues. Recently, the Municipal Citizens' Welfare Association and the Social Welfare Bureau have both focused their discussions on the hunger and cold of the general destitute people, the elderly, weak, disabled, and orphaned children wandering the streets of the city, and have formulated implementation steps and fundraising methods. The former seems to be no more than providing clothing, porridge, and setting up shelters, etc., while the latter seems to be no more than charity performances and ticket sales. We recognize that street vagrants are indeed one of the morbidities of the social economy, and are indeed a prominent example of the failure to solve the lives of the masses, so the remedy seems to depend on a more planned facility program and a larger-scale fundraising method, which should be undertaken jointly by the government and people from the private economic sector participating in the social welfare movement. Because in wartime, those who speak of the economy of the entire society cannot allow the continuation of famine. The reduction of famine is a guarantee of final victory.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Cotton and Other Purchase Policies to Be Determined by the End of This Month, to Be Announced and Implemented After Approval by the Executive Yuan <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the centralized purchase plan for cotton, oil grains, tobacco, and other items, as well as the purchase prices and other issues, at this time when new cotton, oil grains, tobacco, and other crops are being harvested one after another, a formal decision has not yet been made, which is of great concern to all parties. It is learned that this issue is generally decided by the Materials Control Review Committee and then formally announced and implemented after approval by the Executive Yuan. The Materials Control Review Committee will hold a meeting in Nanjing around the 30th of this month, at which time the above-mentioned centralized purchase plans for three important materials can be submitted for discussion. The content of the plans has been finalized by the liaison meeting of the Materials Control Review Committee's Shanghai office, so it is expected that it can be announced by the Executive Yuan in early next month.</p>
<p>Cotton Department to Prepare Inspection Committee</p>
<p>Since the Cotton Department of the Business Control Council has been fully responsible for this year's cotton collection work, the department has launched various preparations. It has recently been learned from that side that the funds required for the cotton collection have been allocated, and the price issue has also been initially agreed upon by the parties concerned. It can be implemented once approved by the authorities. The council also intends to establish a Cotton Inspection Committee to ensure that the quality of the collected cotton meets standards, and to hire experts to serve as members, specializing in the inspection of cotton quality and technical work.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Non-Industry People May Not Participate in Association Directors and Supervisors <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Since the government ordered the reorganization of trade associations in various industries and the large-scale adjustment of the organizational structure, the main commodity trade associations have completed their reorganization one after another, actively expanding their association affairs. The trade associations of secondary commodities have also been largely completed. It is learned that the competent authorities believe that although the organizational structure of the associations has tended to be strengthened, the responsible personnel may not be perfect, which greatly affects the development of association affairs and the welfare of the industry. Therefore, non-industry people are strictly prohibited from participating in or serving as directors and supervisors. At the same time, those with one of the following circumstances may not be representatives: Non-industry people, those deprived of public rights, those with words or deeds that violate national policies, or who have been sentenced by a court for criminal offenses, those who have been declared bankrupt and have not yet been restored, those who have been expelled from the association, those without the capacity to act. When appointing representatives, a letter of authorization must be given in advance, and the association must be notified and examined before it can be approved. The same applies to replacements. If a new member intends to join the association, they should find two member companies in the same industry to act as guarantors.</p>
<p>As for the Tasks of the Association</p>
<p>They are the following seven points: Joint purchase, storage, transportation, and sale of materials required by members, allocation of raw materials needed by members, adjustment of member business funds and guarantee of debts, proof of member material movement, execution of matters designated or entrusted by the competent authority, adjustment of labor-management disputes, mediation of disputes between members and members or non-members at the request of members, etc.</p>

<p>In Central China, the textile industry has not been able to make satisfactory progress due to the lack of raw materials and materials. Now that cotton has been purchased, there should be a more concrete determination of the Sheng Long organization. The business status of the textile industry in the Chinese side in August averaged 12.6%. There are 32 operating factories, including Shenxin 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, Baofeng, Hefeng, Defeng, Rongfeng, Dongfeng, Minfeng, Jiafeng, Yong'an, An'da, Xinyu, Hongzhang, Xinsheng, Datong, Changxing, Guangdong, Gongyong, Hengtong, Tongyi, Chongxin, Zhongfang, Changhe, Sulun, Dacheng, Tongcheng, Lixin, Litai, and Liyong.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Trends in Chinese Stocks <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Re-emerging, especially in the afternoon, stimulated by a certain rumor, selling. Ordinary, department stores, textiles, and the precious metals sectors all tended to decline. Large households were skittish, and short-term investors were eager to sell, so prices fluctuated. Only financial and real estate stocks were favored by investors, with some even experiencing an increase due to short covering. The dynamics of various sectors throughout the day are recorded below. Department Stores: Yong'an Company fluctuated greatly in the morning but retreated by half a grade in the afternoon. Xinxin and Guodai Company both hit lows in the afternoon, with the latter approaching a major mark. Underwear broke through a threshold. Liann and Guanghua Department Stores both showed softening trends.</p>
<p>Textiles: Yong'an Textile fell by half a mark. Zhongfang declined even more. Xinhuo approached the edge. Meiya Silk Factory showed a small decline in the afternoon. Only Rongfeng remained stable. Xinfu and Xinfu Printing and Dyeing stood still at the original price. Meilun and Lunhua saw small price drops again. Tianlun and Dagong were supported by limited purchase orders. Jingfu Shirt fluctuated narrowly. Jinglun rose instead. China Silk saw softening again.</p>
<p>New Medicines: Xinya Pharmaceutical declined slightly. Zhongfa and Zhongxi also fell. Wuzhou, Xinyi, and Jiufu Pharmaceutical remained stable. Xinxin rose by half a percentage point.</p>
<p>Culture: World Bookstore retreated to the edge. Commercial Press and Zhonghua Bookstore remained stable.</p>
<p>Real Estate: Yongxing Real Estate once rose to double the par value outside the pass. Lianhua also rose strongly. Xinyi remained stable.</p>
<p>Public Utilities: Zhabei Water and Electricity and China Business Electric Power still hovered at the pass. Public Utilities Electric Appliances remained stable.</p>
<p>Industry: Great China Match once rose by half a grade in the morning, but declined in the afternoon. Nanyang Tobacco also retreated into the pass. Jiuan Industrial was slightly soft. Zhonghua Industrial was even more sluggish. Kangyuan Canning remained the most stable, standing firmly at the pass. Standard Monosodium Glutamate buyers rose again, rising by 10%. China Xing Coal Mine was also slightly higher.</p>
<p>Summary of Market Conditions</p>
<p>Public Bonds: Yesterday, the market continued to rise sharply after changing to futures trading. The volume of goods sold was very large, and the rising trend was also not weak, but the distance was getting farther and farther, and this abnormal situation was not optimistic. Type C was initially stable, once falling back slightly. After hovering for a long time, it rushed out of the pass. The result was more than seven feet higher than the previous day. Other types A and E had more transactions and also rose by one foot five or six. The volume of transactions for types B and D was extremely low and also increased by half a foot.</p>
<p>Overnight Interest Rate: The interest rate of the Qianye Association was 1.2%, unchanged.</p>
<p>Grain Market Prices: continued to rise yesterday. Rice prices rose sharply for the first time after the establishment of the Rice Association due to increased difficulty in transportation and strong sales by holders. Oil prices also rose.</p>
<p>Tea: Transactions remained scarce. The asking price for green tea continued to rise, resulting in very few transactions on the market. According to industry insiders, the future selling price is still expected to be good. Only black tea had slight sales in the city, with Zhifeng Yuxing Tea Shop and other tea shops purchasing about 16 boxes, sold by Gongchang Chunji Tea Shop. The market was brisk.</p>
<p>Medicinal Materials: Transactions remained sluggish, with sporadic supply and demand. Actual sales were also sluggish, and the market showed little improvement.</p>
<p>Rayon: The market remained weak and continued to lack activity. With weak actual sales, dealers also felt tired, and prices fell slightly again.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities: Regarding the allocation of soap and matches in the one-eight districts, the stores in the same industry designated as retail outlets by the municipal authorities have paid all the deposits, but the date of delivery and sale has not yet been officially notified by the authorities. It is learned that the date of sale of the allocated goods is expected to be in early next month. However, the public's need for soap and matches is quite urgent, so during the suspension of transactions in the daily necessities industry, due to the public's continuous purchases, holders felt that the goods were scarce and could be sold at a premium, resulting in continuous price increases.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Coal Supply Gradually Smoothes, Fears Will Dissipate <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The coal supply in this city has recently shown a sudden panic. In order to understand the truth, the reporter visited a person responsible for the allocation yesterday. According to him, the allocation of coal has been implemented for a year and a half since adhering to the purpose of the Coal Association, and the past results have been quite good. The lack of phenomenon this time is due to the delay in transportation and a slight decrease in arrivals. This month, the temporary delay in the allocation of domestic coal is due to the rectification of small retailers. At the same time, the high price of firewood has led to an increase in users, resulting in a situation where supply does not meet demand. At present, the source of coal has been smoothed as planned, and it is expected to return to its original state by the middle of next month.</p>

<p>The state of the war is becoming increasingly fierce, and the battle situation has now entered a decisive phase. At this critical juncture, the government should concentrate all manpower and material resources on the execution of the war, and actively reorganize the political and economic systems. However, it is regrettable that there are still shortcomings in the unification and integration strategy of the national spirit, which is the driving force. If the war is prolonged and the battle situation becomes more complicated, then differences of opinion will naturally arise in the judgment of the situation, and the guiding principles of the war will be confused. This is true in any country. What Japan needs now to carry out the war is to concentrate the spiritual power of the people on destroying England and the United States, so that the enemy's propaganda tactics have no way to be used. At this decisive stage, to remind the nation of its awakening, we specially invite our company's Mr. Tokutomi Sohō and former Ambassador to China Honda Kumatarō to publish their dialogue in the newspaper, hoping that everyone will remember their ardent and patriotic feelings. The following is a summary of their shorthand record:</p>

<p>From my point of view, among the current government officials, the most enthusiastic worker must be Mr. Tōjō. However, the general public is not following in Mr. Tōjō's footsteps, taking it easy and letting Mr. Tōjō be busy alone. To be honest, everything is flowing into a general formality. Let's put these aside for the time being and talk about the war issue. No one has thoroughly thought about what the meaning of this war is. People like Mr. Honda, who are in a diplomatic guiding position, and those who have had a conversation with him, I think it would be beneficial to Japan's diplomacy! He is very clear about the situation in China. I went there once in Meiji 39 (1906) and met Mr. Honda in Beijing, just when he and Mr. Abe Moritarō were in China. Moreover, Mr. Honda has attended all the major conferences in the world and appeared on all the major stages, so he knows everything very clearly.</p>
<p>What Mr. Tōjō says is not actually implemented, which is really regrettable. These are the most important tasks today, and the people who are really implementing them are the lower-level people. Especially the students, who are sharing the difficulties because of the country's crisis. I have a grandson in military school, and although he is sick this year, he is still in the military, regardless of his physical condition. Speaking of my young relatives, some of them also want to serve in the air force. I have another grandson who has decided to join the air force. This is just in my immediate circle. Other young people are probably also working very enthusiastically. Today, teachers are not as good as students; it is the students who are dragging the teachers along. This shows that Japan's spirit is very hot in some places, very cold in others, very real in some places, and very superficial in others.</p>
<p>What I resonate with most about Mr. Honda's views is that the Japanese do not know the misery of defeat if they are unfortunately defeated. That must be known by those who know the situation in Japan, those who participated in the Boshin War, the people of Aizu. Only the people of Aizu have experienced the misery of a defeated army quite deeply. But most of those predecessors have already died, and the people now are their children or grandchildren, so Japan only knows victory this time and knows nothing else. Therefore, they have no idea what the misery of defeat is like. The Japanese have no feeling for this at all, so they treat the war as a commonplace thing. After the war starts, it can be stopped, just like two people wrestling. After three rounds of fighting, regardless of the outcome, it can be ended. However, today's war is different because the reasons for the war are different, so...</p>
<p>Mr. Honda Kumatarō</p>
<p>That's right, the reasons for the war are different. Today, it is not Japan who drives out England and the United States as the leader of East Asia, but England and the United States who become the leaders of East Asia and drive out Japan. It is either they kill us, or we kill them. There is no other way, no room for a compromise. If there was such room, it could have been compromised before the decisive battle. So, in any case, this war is either success or failure. So I think this war cannot but be thoroughly investigated. The attitude of the other side. Today is a trivial issue. What Japan is better than England and the United States this time is that Japan's flag is clear. If this becomes an immovable fact, then the other side will weep, which is different from before. This is because they realize that they were wrong, and they don't know what to do in the future, so they can only cry. If we do not fundamentally concentrate our efforts on destroying England and the United States, Japan has no place to stand. The other side also has considerable weaknesses. They certainly have strengths, but they have more weaknesses. We have studied the United States for a long time, and we are generally clear about where their weaknesses are and how certain points are. Whether viewed from a social point of view or from the point of view of economic organization, there are countless flaws. However, they think that Japan is in distress, so they maintain their flaws. Once they know that Japan is not in distress, the other side is different from Japan. They do not have an emperor of ten thousand years, and the so-called president of the other side is like a manager of a company.</p>
<p>Honda</p>
<p>What you said just now</p>
<p>There are various weaknesses. Let me say a few professional words. During the war here, Churchill said personally, I heard it with my own ears, that Germany is preparing, which shows that we are completely caught off guard, and are being sucker punched - this is a lie. He said that as long as we act in time, with the vast resources of the UK and the greatness of the national character, we can go anywhere, but now he is also talking about a long-term plan of a hundred years. Japan won in the early stages of the war, but with the industrial production capacity of the United States, plus the strength of the UK, they can use a long-term war to scare Japan. But now this intimidation is no longer effective. What I feel is that the intimidation with a long-term war has been very anxious since this spring.</p>
<p>Even the American side is very anxious. What Roosevelt said about the war, even the professional soldiers don't know what it is all about. What the United States is particularly anxious about is that the US economic life, or the wartime systemization of the domestic economy, is at least three years behind Japan. Since the Pearl Harbor attack, they have been trying to catch up. The cars they use to get around can't run, and meat is also rationed. The people's tolerance for this rapid wartime systematized life, that is, their endurance, is no match for us Japanese. That immediately becomes a social problem, creating a social phenomenon, so money is used lavishly. No matter what kind of regulatory measures the government uses, if it wants to gradually flow money, it will turn into inflation. However, in Japan, in a country like you said, we have a heart of death, because it is a time of life and death, so everyone clenches their teeth, regardless of everything, and happily endures the heavy burden, while the other side, from Roosevelt's point of view, everything starts from the perspective of next year's presidential election. In next year's election battle, we must use all means to hope to be re-elected. Roosevelt has already broken the tradition of the founding of the country three times, and this time he is preparing for a fourth term, so in any case, we must establish a very unreasonable war plan, so the war is very blind, and we cannot but pay unnecessary sacrifices in terms of people and things. That country, which is originally good at propaganda, says very little about its own losses, and its victories are particularly exaggerated. But these must have battle results that can suppress the people. This is the reason for the intensification of the battles in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea since last August. In short, on the one hand, we hope to force the people to hold next year's election, and on the other hand, we hope to end the war as soon as possible. For Roosevelt, the war itself is a political strategy. From the beginning of the war to the surrender of Germany, he lived in London for four years and one month. Recently, because there is no new inspiration, I revisited the books I read during the last war and got a lot of inspiration. From the beginning of August 1914, through 1915 and 1916, that is, the third year of the war, after two years of war, although the war poems were the victorious Germany, or the UK and France, which were in a passive position and fighting a long-term war, they both felt extremely troubled because they had no way to end the war. Among them, Russia collapsed in 1917 due to a revolution that occurred halfway, and then an unexpected result occurred due to the entry of the United States. Even if the United States did not participate, the result is still uncertain. In short, in the case of the UK, why was the Asquith cabinet dissolved? After the Asquith cabinet was dissolved, a coalition cabinet was formed with the Conservative Party. That coalition cabinet was internally bombed by Lloyd George in December 1916 and finally dissolved. At that time, the Lloyd George cabinet was actually a domestic country based on the Conservative Party. At that time, in order to induce Austria to negotiate peace alone, the Briand cabinet of France and the Asquith cabinet of the UK were often in a state of anxiety. The difficulty of ending the war with military force, because they wanted to use political work to end the war, so Germany, needless to say, England and France were often in distress. Two years later, Germany, which had the upper hand on the battlefield, and England and France, which were at a disadvantage, both hoped to end the war. In the last war, the UK used all the capital interest and dividends to pay for the war expenses. If the interest and dividends were not enough, even the capital was used. However, after the war, even though only ten years had passed, the UK thought that there would be no more wars in the world. In fact, because the UK was confident that it could complete its hegemony over the world without war, it reduced its army and even its navy, so there was a plan to reduce armaments.

<h3 id="e70">### Launching a Literacy Campaign Zhang Qiyang <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>In order to clarify the importance of the literacy movement, and in order to make everyone widely recognize the importance of the position occupied by the literacy movement in the nation-building process, we particularly emphasize that the rise and fall of the nation depends on the level of national culture, and the level of national culture depends entirely on whether the national literacy movement can be popularized.</p>
<p>We should first recognize clearly that the literacy movement is by no means compulsory education, let alone primary school education. It is a people's conscious movement under the guidance of government agencies and with the assistance of formal education. On the one hand, it is the organic advocacy of the government; on the other hand, it is the enthusiastic promotion of social progressives and educators; and on the other hand, it contains the conscious awareness of the people. This is the characteristic of the literacy movement. If this point is ignored, then the literacy movement cannot be discussed, cannot be carried out, and the result will inevitably be failure.</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that there are indeed too many illiterates today, which is shocking. People are displaced and wander around, let alone literacy education. Society is unstable and insecure, and the government has no time to take care of it. However, the literacy movement is so important to the future of the nation that we dare not remain silent. Based on the characteristics of the literacy movement and examining the current environment, a draft outline of a literacy movement plan (the detailed measures will be carefully and precisely determined by education experts and administrative authorities) is provided for everyone to discuss:</p>
<p>The education administration authorities should gather educators with practical experience in the country to organize a literacy movement promotion committee to carefully formulate the implementation methods of the literacy movement, and instruct schools at all levels and relevant social organizations to implement it.</p>
<p>Compile literacy textbooks for the people: The principles should be simple, easy to understand, and in line with the actual life of the people. They should be distributed to illiterates free of charge, and the printing costs should be requested from the national government by the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>Before launching this movement, the Pao-Chia system should be used to investigate the exact number of illiterates by the Pao-Chia Office in conjunction with other local self-government agencies.</p>
<p>All illiterates should be evenly distributed according to the Pao-Chia area. Then, local schools, social groups, and various public places should be used to implement teaching.</p>
<p>Teachers can use the extracurricular time of primary school teachers, normal school students, middle school students, and university students to teach voluntarily, and they must not shirk their responsibilities. Those with excellent results will be rewarded and commended by the government, and those with poor results will be given appropriate punishment.</p>
<p>Use little teachers, that is, teach as soon as you know, to seek rapid results. During the Incident of the Same Day (1925), Mr. Tao Xingzhi advocated it first, and local people's education groups and normal schools responded to it later. The trial results were remarkably successful. Unfortunately, the authorities at that time did not provide vigorous assistance, excellent textbooks were not compiled, and the people's awareness was not improved. As a result, the lively little teacher literacy movement at one time faded into insignificance. The author was then in a certain normal school, personally involved in the affair, and deeply felt that this method was a shortcut to promote the literacy movement. The reason why it later faded into insignificance and folded its flags was not because the method was not good, but because of the lack of effort of all circles and regions to promote it. Because using little teachers to promote the literacy movement not only saves a lot of manpower and material resources, but also is a truly penetrating movement. The people can avoid the interference with work and the loss of time, and of course they will sincerely accept the literacy. This kind of conscious acceptance and request of the people is the true success of people's education. Therefore, the author does not repeat the old tune and proposes this well-deserved shortcut to the people's literacy movement - the little teacher system. The above is just a rough outline, or an old theory, or a previous pattern. Because our society and country are too bad, the author does not want to be innovative and establish new things, but only hopes that the above-mentioned issues can be achieved, which is already the dawn of the nation's future.</p>

<h3 id="e71">### Children's Library: Fundraising for Library Buildings <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Children's Library has been in operation for three years. 150,000 children in this city have enjoyed free reading of books. Mobile circulation stations have been set up in various districts, group book borrowing is organized in various schools, and mobile libraries are held in various neighborhoods, so that general children have the opportunity to borrow and read books for free. Now, because the library business is gradually expanding, the original library building is not enough. The building is valued at 55,000 yuan, but the library has no funds and cannot afford it, so it is planned to organize a charity football match between the Portuguese and Tonghua football teams.</p>
<p>The proceeds from the sale of tickets will be used to purchase library buildings. It is scheduled to be held at the Yiquan Greyhound Racing Track at 10:00 a.m. on the 31st of this month. Ticket prices are divided into three types: 100 yuan, 50 yuan, and 20 yuan. The ticket sales points are the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association, Sichuan Road Four Bank Savings Association Ying Yongyu, Sanma Road Xinfu Industrial Company, Sima Road World Bookstore, the Dahua Shopping Mall Children's Library, and Yiquan. Ma Shan'er Ke Lasha Kao Situo, who is as famous as Li Huitang, will play a righteousness game. At that time, it is expected to be a grand occasion.</p>

<p>Zhao Zhuping (formerly Zhao Shuping), a female national doctor specializing in typhoid fever, gynecology, and pediatrics, has served in the medical field for many years. She is praised by those who know her for her loyalty and prudence. Recently, because of the sight of the suffering, she can't help but promote the noble love of mankind with the same compassion. She has also received enthusiastic and generous sponsorship from relatives and friends. Starting from the 27th of this month, she will set up a new clinic to provide diagnosis and free medicine, so that the poor and sick will have a new way of life. The location is at the Tianjitang National Medical Clinic at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Tongfu Road. The time is from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. every day. All the very poor who come to the clinic will be diagnosed and given medicine according to the number.</p>

<p>Daxi Road has now been changed to "Chang'an Road," Ou Jia Road has been changed to "Kulun Road," and Gongguan Road has been changed to "Jinling Road." The writer now lives in Zhabei and knows that there is already a Chang'an Road at the north end of the Xin Zha Bridge, a Kulun Road at the north end of the Wuzhen Road Bridge (the bridge has been removed), and a Jinling Road near Datong Road and Gonghe Road. I hope that all sectors will pay attention to avoid misunderstandings. (Xu Yiping)</p>
