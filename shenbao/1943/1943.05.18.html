<p>社評</p>
<h3>商統會工作亟待開展　關於商統會基層機構幾個法令的商權</h3>
<p>全國商業統制總會成立至今，已二月有餘，除了完成內部機構和接收七號出張所，繼續辦理簽證工作以外，對於該會基本工作：「統制·收購及分配」的實現，尙無消息。友邦日本交還統制職權是何等的熱誠；社會上對於統制工作的實現，是何等的渴望；內地各處對於物資配給的需要，是何等的迫切。該會肩負如此重大之使命，就應殫精竭慮迎頭趕上，以「敏捷」爭取「時間」，迅赴事機，以饜人民喁喁之望。</p>
<p>據聞該會至今尙未能實現基本工作，主要原因，在該會之下層機構，即構成該會之會員份子，亦即直接辦理統制，收購，分配之商業團體，迄未組織完成。我們如將全國統制總會暫行條例，工商業同業公會暫行條例，和工商同業聯合會組織暫行通則公佈的日期，作一番研究，就可以明白統制工作之遲遲不能實現，其咎在於組織程序之先後倒置，租有關組織下層機構之法令，在時間上未能湊合，以致應該辦事可以辦事的下層機構，至今尙未完全成立，而影響商統會以至整個統制工作。現在工商同業公會暫行條例和工商同業聯合會組織暫行通則，旣已先後公佈，那末，各項主要商品的工商同業聯合會必須趕速組織完成，進一步把統制物資工作積極推動，從速實現商統會的基本任務。</p>
<p>就上述三種條例加以綜合硏究，不無矛盾之點，同時更不免顯示自治其名，而官治其實。我們知道戰時一切法令，或因倉卒制定，原不能如平時之嚴密周匝，不過，像這樣有關中日商民共同遵守的重要法令，在時間上並不怎樣倉卒，而草率制定，自相矛盾，實深遺憾。</p>
<p>例如全國商業統制總會暫行條例第四條，明明規定商統會所屬會員（按即工商同業聯合會）辦理統制事項，應受商統會的監督指導，而商統會則秉承中央主管官署的命令辦理。這當然是有系統的規定。可是，工商同業聯合會組織暫行通則弟六條，却又將工商同業聯合會地位，抬高到和商統會並列，使之可以同一直接秉承中央主管官署的命令，（通則第六條爲「工商同業聯合會，承中央主管官署之命，監督指導所屬會員辦理全國商業統制總會暫行條例第四條所規定之各款事項。）從法律觀點言，糧實兩部是以部令來變更全國最高國防會議通過的法例。從辦事系統言，成立商統會的目的，原來就是爲秉承政府命令監督指導所屬會員辦理統制工作，現在各聯合會旣然可以直接秉承政府命令，又何必更有此龐大重複的商統會組織。再爲商民着想，商民對於法律本已缺乏研究，益以前後矛盾之法令，將使商民愈益感覺無所適從。同時將釀成兩種嚴重後果：第一，是造成權限上的爭執。商統會可以依據全國最高國防會議所通過的該會暫行條例，根本不理會糧實兩部所會同公佈的工商同業聯合會組織暫行通則。因爲照立法程序而言，命令本來就沒有變更或對抗法律的能力。第二，是商統會可以將一切統制的責任，諉卸到主管官署方面，無論該會是採取第一種或第二種辦法，其於統制工作的前途均屬有損無益，可以斷言。</p>
<p>再就商業自治立塲而言，商統會之理監事全體由政府指定，已不免貽人以違背自治精神之口實，其唯一理由。尙可諉爲商統會倉卒成立，不得已而採用一種緊急權宜辦法。而工商同業聯合會，則從容籌備，其理監事人選，在通則中何以也規定要用指定的方式。政府對於商人自治統制這一點，旣在法令上公佈於先，而事實上則束縛自治統制的活動，誠令人難於索解。我們認爲統制制度，確爲現階段的戰時經濟中急須採用，而從速實現的必要措施，謹再提供意見數點，以備政府及商統會採納：</p>
<p>（一）矛盾抵觸的法令，在政府應重加考慮，予以適當修正，在商統會應重視目身職權則據理力爭，提請政府修正，不可含糊，以致影響工作效果，貽誤重大使命。</p>
<p>（二）商統會的理監事，和已經成立各業聯合會的理監事，由政府指定，雖屬遷就事實，終不免違背自治原則，而尙未成立的各業聯合會，其理監事人選，務必由會員中自行選出，不可再用指定方式，一誤再誤。</p>
<p>（三）對於統制工作的範圍和權限，政府和商統會應該有明確之劃分，凡屬商統會範圍以內的事，政府不應攙越干涉，商統會亦當認淸職責，保持當仁不讓的態度。</p>
<p>（四）統制工作，是戰時安定民生的緊急措施，有等於醫生對於病人的緊急救護，敏捷負責，是辦理統制工作的每個人時時刻刻所應檢討的一件事。我們希望商統會對此多多注意，尤其希望主管官署對此更加特別注意。</p>
<p>自治統制，是最高國防會議所確定的國策；最高國防會議，是戰時國家最高的權力機構；任何機關或人民，對於國防會議的決議案，有絕對遵守的義務；也就是任何機關或人民，對於自治統制有竭力擁護之義務。</p>

<p>谷大使談話</p>
<p>南京十七日中央社電　日本新任大使谷正之氏於十七日上午十一時在國府大禮堂覲謁主席呈遞國書，下午四時並於大使官邸，接見中外新聞記者，發表就任談話。是日谷大使御禮服，偕同堀內公使，淸水書記官，松平書記官，松尾書記官等陪席，大使笑容滿面，態度溫和，眉宇間則充滿英斷氣度，各記者一一呈遞名刺後，谷大使耶席發表其就任抱負，並與記者交換意見，歷一時餘始畢。茲誌其談話如後：本人此次奉命就任駐中華民國大使，十四日到達南京，本日得覲謁在主席閣下，捧呈天皇陛下之信仟狀，深爲光榮愉快，我中日兩國國民因地理的歷史的民族的關係，彼此互相以理解同情，而相扶相助，共同努力於東亞之解放及永安，乃當然之理。鄙國亦夙以此方針，爲不動之信念，是過去鄙國已爲此盡不斷之努力，然尙未臻於理想階段，實爲遺憾。考其原因，一面固由於美英之離間中日兩國所致，然另一方面，亦不能不認爲兩國國民缺乏努力。自事變以來，日軍於大陸不斷地活潑行動，舉陸海軍力景壓迫渝方政權，大東亞戰爭爆發以來，雖僅一年有半，東亞情勢已有大轉變，日軍戰勝之結果，即將敵人在東亞策謀據點，悉予覆滅，今復於擴大領域封鎖敵人之離間策動，一方復確保無限之國防資源，整備極有利之作戰體形於前綫，隨處予敵以制壓，大事發展之基礎條件，以及必勝不敗之態勢，業已確立，就東亞大局言，實爲意義深長之事。而國民政府，亦於大東亞戰爭開始，同時表明與日本同甘共苦之態度，一月九日更毅然佈吿對英美宣戰，與日本結成生死關係，立於共同陣綫，想及百年來英美有形無形之壓迫，此實爲應有之歸結。今得中日兩國共同協力向完遂大東亞戰爭，復興大東亞與確立共榮圈大道邁進，爲東亞前途放無限光明，實堪同慶。日本帝國戰友中國其國民多年希望之自主獨立，即完成而予以最大之協力，目前之希望正努力講求對復興繁榮所應寄與協力之方法，本人當根據鄙國政府之根本方針，於確固不動之信念，積極謀求新方針之早日實現。再余曩會以公使賣格，駐剳上海，在國內亦曾多年担任對中日外交處理之任務，今後的職務執行上當與中國政府當局，內外同志友人等，共同勇往邁進，以增進中日兩國民之互相理解提携，而達成兩國共同之理想，復幸得有國民政府及內外各方面之協力，尤爲本人所最感欣幸之處。最後對於在中國居留之帝國官民各位，能奉戴大詔與御心，體貼政府之方針，各竭奉公之誠，當衷心表示忻意。今後並悉和衷共濟，各安本分，各盡職務，向偉大之信念邁進。</p>

<p>南京十七日中央社電　渝第二十四集團軍總司令兼冀察特別戰區總司令龐炳勳上將，已宣言參加和運，率所部七萬餘將士來歸。按第二十四集團軍，爲渝　之番號，所轄部隊，爲第四十軍及新編第五軍，龐氏並自兼第四十軍軍長，新編第五軍軍得爲孫殿英。過去第二十四集國軍防區，即爲所謂冀察戰區，第四十軍前軍長爲沈克，所轄師爲第卅九師，師長劉世榮，第十四師，師長馬法吾，新編第五軍副軍長爲邢肅植，此次歸順將兵總額，共七萬餘衆。</p>
<p>總參謀長發表談話</p>
<p>南京十七日中央社電　渝第廿四集團軍總司令龐炳勳，新　第五軍軍長孫殿英兩將軍，於本月十四日率領所部七萬餘人，遵令復員，並在防次發表聲明，擁護國府，效忠和運，軍委會鮑總參謀長文樾對此事特發表談話如下：渝方第廿四集團軍總司令龐炳勳，新編第五軍軍長孫殿英兩將軍，於本月十四日率領都衆七萬餘人，遵令復員，並發表聲明，擁　國府，效忠和運，在遠聞之，無任欣慰。我國最高領袖　主席遵奉國父大亞洲主義，以倡和平反共建　爲國策，領導全國各黨各派勇猛邁進，以完成中國全面的統一的和平，再進而至於以道義爲基礎的東亞眞正和平及世界新秩序的理想的和平。所以國府還都伊始，即首先下令，着各方抗戰將士，即速復員，精誠合作，三年以來，各地抗戰將士，雖被渝方暴力所刦持，及其歪曲宣傳所蒙蔽，未能自拔，毅然來歸，但有識之士，先後來歸者，已復不尠。此次龐孫兩將軍以七萬餘精銳之衆，據太行險要之區，率部前來，參加和運，不惟我國民政府突增生力之軍，加强對英美戰爭力量，卽頑迷不悟之渝蔣，驟失此干城之衆，其抗戰到底之迷夢，亦必日趨崩潰而無疑，龐孫兩將軍爲我國各將軍中耆宿，鄙人前充軍事委員會北平分會辦公廳主任時，曾同袍澤，共事一方，對其勇猛剛毅信賞必罰之性格，已非常欽佩，至其部衆之勇猛善戰，紀律嚴明，更早爲國人所熟知。茲旣受我最高領袖偉大人格之感召，對焦土殘民的共匪深惡痛絕，同時復洞鑒大東亞戰爭暴發後之形勢，非東亞各民族共同團結，不足以肅淸英美之殘餘勢力，以達到中國獨立自由，遂毅然脫離渝蔣，以共負此復興中華保衛東亞之偉大任務，益徵其謀國之忠，見地之偉，非一般隨波逐浪者所可比擬。所望愛國家愛民挨不辭艱苦的渝方抗戰將士們，隨龐孫兩將軍之後，毅然奮起，參加和運。</p>
<p>林宣部長發表談話</p>
<p>南京十七日中央社電　林宣傳部長頃爲龐炳勛孫殿英兩將軍率來歸事，發表談話如下：</p>
<p>國府還都三年以來，渝方將領深明大義陸續來歸者不乏其人，此次龐炳勛孫殿英兩將軍鑒於渝方勾結共黨，禍國殃民，毅然於本月十四日發表聲明，遵照國府停戰復員命令率領所部全體將士七萬餘人來歸，參加和運，共同於復興中華解放東亞努力，此實領袖偉大精神之所感召，抑亦龐孫兩將軍正視時會及體認國父遺敎作革命軍人之模範，而爲國人所矜式者，龐孫兩將軍過去爲西北軍首領名將，現在爲重慶第二十四集團軍總司令及冀察戰區副總司令，在過去抗戰期間有過光榮之戰，龐將軍亦爲重慶軍事方面具有重要地位之將領，此次率部來歸，意義極　重大。</p>
<p>日軍當局發表談話</p>
<p>北京十七日中央社電　據晋豫省境前綫某地來電，此間日軍當局，頃就渝方冀察戰區副總司令第廿四集團軍軍長陸軍上將龐炳勛，及新編第五軍長孫殿英將軍此次率部歸來，効忠國府，發表談話如次，以龐炳勛孫殿英兩將軍之率部來歸，已予渝第廿四集團殘部及其他部隊等以極大衝動，故刻正陸續來歸，平漢沿綫南部太行山脈渝方之所謂抗日陣營，已完全潰滅矣。</p>
<p>北京十七日中央社電　龐炳勳孫殿英兩將軍此次參加和運，華北日軍報道部長特發表談話如下：龐炳勳孫殿英兩將軍此次率部參加和運，爲中國爲東亞前途誠堪同慶。龐孫兩將軍對於時局，已有充分認識，深知中日關係，已立於同生共死之階段，同時國府政治力，已日形充實强化，渝方政策之矛盾，已暴露無遺，最近渝方將領投效和運者，有孫良誠，吳化文諸將軍，此足顯示渝方陣營內自覺之士，日見增加，而龐孫兩將軍此次率部來歸，此實予行將崩潰之渝蔣以重大打擊。</p>
<p>龐炳勳氏發表談話</p>
<p>北平十七日中央社電　據冀豫省境前綫訊，龐炳勳將軍自率部來歸後，曾對記者團發表談話，茲誌大意如次：余自國府還都後，由於在主席偉大人格之感召，並鑒於中日合作之現况後，乃決心脫離渝方參加和運。今目睹和平區內一切建設工作進展之速，實令人無限欣慰，此時此際實爲吾人救國救民之時，’爲建設復興中國起見，余今後善當在主席領導之下，傾全力於剿共工作，余甚盼渝方舊日同志，亦能早日幡然來歸，共事建國大業。</p>
<p>龐孫兩將軍之通電</p>
<p>太原十七日中央社電　日軍自太行山脈猛攻渝第廿四集團軍約八萬二千人後，爲時尙僅一旬，擊斃及俘虜渝軍達一萬五千人，已獲得偉大戰果，而完成預期目的，茲該軍總司令龐炳勛因所部第五軍軍長孫殿英等，大部將領已拋棄抗戰，効忠國府，且深知日本之眞誠，協助國府，中國已有飛躍之進展，而大東亞戰爭，亦已確立勝利之基礎，乃決定率前已反正之部下孫殿英等各將領，及所部共約七萬餘，毅然擁護國府，實現其剿共救國之夙願。龐孫二氏除已命令部下集合外，並於十四日在某地聯名發出和平通電，大意謂，炳勛殿英洞觀世界情勢及推察民意趨向，深知非參加和平陣營，無安定東亞之路，非剿滅共匪，無促進和平之術，故決自民國卅二年五月十日起脫離渝方，擁護國民政府，信任友邦日本，打倒英美，以期完成大東亞之共存共榮。惟以才識淺陋，實感責任重大，深願賢達先進，時予指導云云。現該新編第五軍軍長孫殿英，副軍長楊明卿，參謀長馮德明，新編第三師長楊克有，新編第四師長王廷英等多數幹部將領兵士約二萬人，及李振汾所率第四十軍之第一百零六師約一萬人，及其他部等共七萬餘人，已完全在某地集合完畢，於此即將以國府軍隊之有力一部，協力日軍向渝共軍作戰。如此在華北方面所屬之渝軍，僅有苟延殘喘于山東之于學忠部，魯蘇戰區之殘軍，而中國自參戰以來，治安地區乃亦益見擴大。又中日事變以來，以集團軍司令而參加和平陣營者，當以龐炳勛將軍爲嚆矢，而渝方冀察戰區，至此乃完全消滅。</p>
<h3>重光外相就任後　對華政策加緊推動　確立日本戰時外交三基點</h3>
<p>重光外相自本月四日起開始接見駐東京各國大使，於七日吿終。八日接見土耳共，中華民國，阿根廷，羅馬尼亞的代理大使，至是，駐京十九個國家的代表者之接見遂吿終了。軍光大使的接見時間，大使是一小時至一小時半，公使是半小時，不用翻譯，親自與各大使公使作就任寒暄，並交換意見，獲得很大的成果，値得大書特書。重光外相自就任後所表示的積極態度，國內國外對之極爲關心。外相　堅持的戰時外交的基礎方針有三點：</p>
<p>（一）日本外交方針，循旣定國策進行，並無何等變更。</p>
<p>（二）對中華民國及其他大東亞共榮圈國家的新政策，今後更將奮力推進。</p>
<p>（三）對世界情勢的推移，把握住正確的認識。在第一點，日本擊滅英美，建設東亞新秩序，樹立眞正的世界和平，自然是日本旣定的國策，外交政策也以此爲基礎，不因外相的更迭而有所變動。</p>
<p>在第二點，對華新政東最可以表現重光外相的特色。前祚駐華大使任內，曾傾其全部精力以遂行新政策，在國民政府的强化上，在中日共同遂行戰爭上，在增進中國國民的福利上，曾成就了很多的業績。如上所述，重光外相就任第一聲就說對華新政策今方發靸，自己以外相的地位，對此取爲關注。誠然，大東亞建設的重點，首先應在中華民國更進一步的推進，是無可置疑的。劉於其他共榮圈諸國，亦使各該國各得其所，相輔以成</p>
<p>在第三點，世界政局並戰局的客觀情勢，雖然日本已占軍事的優勢，但亦不能過於樂觀，戰時外交的重要事項，即在於時常注視情勢的推栘，而有正確的認識與對策。重光外相歷任駐蘇，駐英，駐華大使，並曾屢訪柏林，有廣大的認織與經騐，自能產生最正確的判斷。但要認識，把握世界情勢，更感到有派造能幹的外交官至歐洲的必要，因而，不能不從速擴充强化駐歐的外交機關。最近南京的中村參事官之被仟爲駐芬公使，即其第一着，頗堪注目。如此，軍事與外交成爲眞正的表裏一體，向戰勝的前途邁進，實爲今日最切要的事項。（翔：譯自五月九日東京每日新聞）</p>

<h3>庫彭區德取獲主動　蘇聯軍三師被擊潰　芬蘭具有作戰到底決心</h3>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　德國新聞計軍事特派員哈瑪上校本日稱：在過去兩日間，庫彭橋頭堡地區之主動，顯已轉入德軍之手。德軍突擊部隊於前日奪得蘇軍重要陣地，並與蘇軍以極大損害後，昨日又繼續攻擊，獲得特殊成功。在橋頭堡之東面戰綫，又復佔領地區多處，並俘獲蘇軍數百人，集合凖備攻擊之敵軍至少有三師被擊潰，所有重軍器皆被奪獲或毀壞。東綫其他地區無重要消息。</p>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　德國新聞社航空特派員佛萊達少校稱，過去兩日間，有德戰鬥機及轟炸機數百架在庫彭橋顯堡協助作戰精强之轟炸機隊　擊蘇聯之重砲隊，毀其大半。其他德空軍部隊亦襲擊蘇方鐵路及公路之運輸獲得成功，駛向庫彭區之滿載兵車一列受創甚重，不能前進。德重轟炸機及長程偵察機亦有效的襲擊蘇方供應及鐵路交通，數處重要軌道被有接擊中而毀壞。軍火庫一處着火。在斐許半島東之北極海中，有三十噸之敵貨船一艘爲　機所擊沉。</p>
<p>赫爾辛某十六日中央社電　芬蘭總理林柯米在芬蘭陣亡將士紀念日發表動人演說，謂芬蘭決心與蘇聯作戰至最後一人，而不願受其東鄰國家之支配。渠稱芬蘭民挨酷愛和平，但不能任其自由受蹂躪，芬蘭民族決不容外人破壞其國家之生存與獨立。渠又警吿民衆，謂最近尙無和平希望，民衆應凖備更作許多犧牲。芬總理最後又籲請民衆保持團結，渠稱團結即芬蘭之力量。</p>
<h3>羅邱會議續誌　未來戰略秘密討論中</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城十六日中失社電　據華盛頓消息：今日羅斯福總統及英首相邱吉爾，曾與各高級官員舉行會議歷半小時許，而參謀部亦在絕對秘密中從事辯論。邱氏曾分別與英駐美大使哈里法克斯，澳外長伊伐特及美國務卿晤談，並訂期與英戰時供應部大臣黎塞斯相晤。下週邱氏將會晤加拿大總理金氏，並信邱氏更將與蔣夫人宋美齡會談。</p>
<p>日內瓦十七日中央社電　德國新聞社消息：羅邱二人週末商討，均以將來的戰略爲主題。華盛頓泰晤士報記者謂，此爲邱氏抵達後兩人集中討論之第一次。蓋羅氏因政務栗碌，加之須招待前捷克總統貝奈斯與玻利維亞總統，迄無片刻餘暇與邱個別會談。　軍事顧問均能利用此空間交換意見，以爲羅邱未來商討之張本。</p>
<p>瑞典京城十七日中央社電　據倫敦泰晤士報轉據華盛頓消息：邱吉爾首相或將出席美參院外交委員會會議，因該會委員多願與首相討論急要問題。</p>
<p>瑞典京城十七日中央社電　據瑞典記者引倫敦報紙消息稱：英國各界方爲突尼西亞勝利舉行盛大慶祝，美國方面則反示寗靜。倫敦觀察報華盛頓記者謂，美方對突境勝利，僅爲前奏性質，故初未加以注意，蓋美各界正期待歐陸與束亞兩方之雙重進攻也。該記者指示華府會議或許已檢討進攻東亞之問題，以爲突境戰爭旣吿終了，一切空餘船只可全部用之於東亞戰綫，其對象當屬日本。瑞典記者則謂，英方對此建議雖表同情，然深慮進攻歐陸，將因同時進攻東亞而遭受危險。另一瑞典報引華府消息，謂美消息靈通方面以爲反軸心軍在北非之勝利，將大形减輕北美農業人力問題之嚴重性，蓋大批被俘之敵軍，將運至北美各地工作，而英方所囚之俘虜，將用之於加拿大農業。該報記者續謂，美軍今後將受在突境戰爭中飽經滄桑之敎練官的嚴格訓練，此亦突境勝利之又一佳果云。</p>

<p>柏林十七日中央社電　今午德官方戰報稱，小隊英機於昨晚襲德，堤壩二處受損，因而發生水災，平民死傷者甚衆。敵機八架被擊落，尙有敵機九架則於襲西部佔領區時被擊落，昨晚德機襲倫敦區歷數小時，對軍事目標擲下重量炸彈，德機兩架未返。</p>

<h3>英美一般意見認義不易擊破</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城十六日中央社電　路透社駐紐約特派員埃姆遜電稱：紐約各評論家之一般意見，皆認爲必須經過艱苦及消耗之戰事，始能將義大利擊破。反軸心國非在歐陸分散其攻勢，即須集中進攻義大利以外之其他前綫。大多　美人皆信反軸心國欲造成義大利國內之分裂，則前途殊甚遙遠。無綫電評論家舒培特曾云，渠之印象以爲反軸心方面將數處同時進犯，而不　　進攻　大利，彼等將在法國南北部及巴爾幹採取攻勢，如此亦可間接牽制同樣數量之義軍，與在義登陸並無不同云。</p>

<h3>阿圖島戰況　日軍士氣極爲旺盛予登陸美軍以打擊</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　日大本營陸軍報道部谷萩部長，本日就阿圖島方面陸上戰况發表談話如次：（一）敵軍於十二日晨在南岸登陸，進至我軍陣地前方，我軍於當日晚對敵軍主力實行夜襲，已將敵軍擊退至海岸綫方面；（二）我軍與十二日晨在北海岸登陸進至我軍陣地前方之敵軍，正展開激戰中；（三）敵軍十二日夕刻圖於東海岸登睦，已於海岸綫方面被擊滅；（四）敵海軍會對島上加以猛烈砲擊，並以飛機掩護，陸續使後繼部隊上陸，增加第一綫兵力，我守備隊以少數兵力防守陣地，而隨時出以勇敢之攻擊，我軍士氣極旺盛。（五）據現地軍報吿，敵軍於五月十四日及十五日會使用毒瓦斯兩次，然我軍則未使用此種毒氣云。</p>
<p>阿根廷京城十七日中央社電　據華盛頓電，關於阿圖島美軍登陸事，日大本營發表數小時後，美海軍證亦以公報發表，美國各報並大肆宣傳，謂此係阿留申羣島反攻作戰之第一步云，但美軍當局則極愼重，關於該島戰局之推移避免說明。海長諾克斯十四日接見記者團時，僅謂「此次登陸作戰，海軍僅供給船隻，登陸部隊乃係陸軍，海軍僅補助而已，現作戰雖在順利進行中，然關於將來如何，則未便預言。」又　澳洲電台廣播華盛頓消自稱：登陸之美軍因遭受日軍之反攻，僅　有阿圖島海岸方面之丘陵荒僻地帶，日軍現正堅强抵抗中。又報知新聞從軍記者愛里奧特少佐對於美國各報之大肆宣傳談稱，阿圖島除浮橋外，並無重要處所，且金島皆山，均附近水域航行亦有種種困難云。</p>

<p>時事選譯北非特輯</p>
<h3>北非戰局與今後</h3>
<p>北非突尼西亞戰綫，至本月七日而急轉直下，反軸心軍向突尼斯，比塞大開始最後的總攻擊。軸心軍則從突尼斯及安菲達比爾之間撤退，續作最後的堅決抵抗。當前次馬萊斯防禦綫失陷的時候，一般人即已預料突尼西亞橋頭堡難於維持，軸心軍令後將從突尼斯南方至安菲達比爾北方築成新防禦綫，背蓬角半島爲陣，作最後的抗戰。從那時候起，從種種戰　的觀點看來，軸心軍從北非撤退，不過是時間問題吧—可是在兵員武器方面的顯著的劣勢下，經六月之久，把反軸心軍的大部牽制在此地，從事大消耗戰。在此期間，對反軸心國向世界所官傳的歐洲大陸侵入作戰，確立强有力的歐洲共同防衛態勢，講求萬全的措置，在新的作戰態勢下，得以有充分的時間專注於束部戰綫上的第三次夏李攻勢。是以北非守備軍的功績，實可予以極大的評價。</p>
<p>北非戰綫的開闢，在英美方面看，無疑的會有對歐洲大陸的第二戰綫之意義。先前德軍開始第二次夏季攻勢後，蘇聯的要地次第落入德軍手中，蘇聯最高國防委昌長斯達林頻頻要求英美開闢第二戰綫，英國對此要求曾在德國及法國占領地作小規模的轟炸及在狄埃浦試行上陸，可是歐洲第二戰綫迄未成功。但因爲斯達林的要求極爲迫切，英美遂決心用最大的犧性，與達朗勾結，實現北非攻勢。並以之作誇大宣傳稱：「這就是第二戰綫的開闢。」斯達林當時自然不承認這就是第二戰綫。英美軍驀地在北非從事大消耗戰，這是主要的原因。</p>
<p>追溯北非戰局的經過，在去年十二月七日未明，以艾森霍華中將爲總司令官的英美聯合軍，乘一組大運輸船團，突然在法屬北非的糜洛哥及阿爾熱利亞兩海岸開始上陸，那時候駐阿爾及亞的法軍總司令官達朗，已與美軍相勾通，在開始上陸的翌日，即與侵入軍締結停戰協定，同月十五日發表樹立北非傀儡政權。</p>
<p>英美軍之對阿爾熱利亞，摩洛哥的不法侵入，希特勒元首於十一命令駐屯法國占領地的德軍精銳，進駐法國非占領地帶，進一步義軍也進駐科西嘉島及尼斯，軸心軍更立即從海空運輸有力的步兵部隊並戰車隊至突尼西亞，先下手占領此要衝。</p>
<p>在此以前，地中海彼岸的北非，自一九四〇年以來，羅美爾將軍所指揮的軸心軍與英第八軍之間，業已在利比亞及埃及的沙漠間進行拉鋸戰，羅美爾軍於十一月初撤至愛爾，阿拉眠，以後續在杜勃魯克，班加齋，愛爾，阿基拉作戰略的後退，至一月二十三日放棄特立波黎，進入南部突尼西亞的馬萊斯要塞綫，與該地的軸心軍握手，軸心軍在突尼西亞牽制住了聯合軍，想由於空軍的活躍一舉而粉碎敵方延長的補給錢。</p>
<p>軸心海軍此時業已確保了都隆，科西嘉島的阿柴佐及比塞大之軍港，這三軍港所描成的三角形，掩有西地中海的中心部，獲得了該方的不可動搖的制海制空權的基礎。這這情勢更有利地展開了。</p>
<p>因了軸心軍的這一次聰敏的作戰，致聯合軍在北非作戰幾個月中早已陷於重大的補給困難，阿爾熱利亞方面反軸心軍的補給路綫，在軸心軍海陸不斷的猛炸下，不僅喪失了很多的戰車，飛機，尤其因爲軸心軍潛水艦在大西洋及地中海水面的活躍，英美方面船艦的損失達到了空前的數額。</p>
<p>在此期間，軸心軍並急急於完成歐洲本土，薩爾其尼亞，西西里，克里特，多得坎尼諸島的防禦。同時並極力警戒把兵員，戰車，飛機向北非增加，以减輕其消耗。</p>
<p>現在從突尼西亞附近的撤退，在軸心方面的影響，雖不在少，但就全部歐洲戰局看來，不過是局部的，北非守備軍英勇戰鬥的期間所構築成功的軸心軍防禦，業已成爲永久的陣地，布成了鐵桶般堅固的陣綫，因而北菲的戰略價値，顯著地减低了。此地已沒有固守的必要了。不必徒然分散兵力，繼續消耗了。這已証明了德國大本營頭腦的優秀。</p>
<p>突尼斯的重要性，完全是由於英美方面之謀略的宣傳。顯然是爲了想鼓舞聯合國方面的士氣，削弱軸心方面的戰意，並誘引中立國傾向自方陣營。英美因北非作戰的成功而掌握了地中海的制海權，保持了西亞與印度的聯絡，一面並直接威脅伊比利亞半島，義大利，把土耳其誘入自方陣營，並企圖向巴爾幹伸展其侵略的魔手。這野心在軸心方面的防衛歐洲之鐵壁前，被粉碎而遭挫折，瞭如觀火。</p>
<p>英美軍把現在的兵力集結於北非，爲了給養補給信些軍隊所需要的運輸船，自去年十二月以來，據說已達一千數百萬噸。今後不僅爲保持這些方，更爲了夢想中的侵人歐洲，還要數十萬大軍，將很感因難吧！因此而需要的運輸船數字，當然不是暫時的增配就可應付，所以到底是難於繼續長久的。</p>
<p>况且地中海的義海軍，一點也沒有損傷，依然健在，德潛水艦的威力也愈見增强。在這狀况下，終究不容許英美想從地中海侵入歐洲大陸。</p>
<p>他們所說的第二戰綫，在今後預料將用飛機開闢空中第二戰綫。但軸心軍在地中海的空軍基地更加强化，在大陸上的防空威力也愈見增大的今日，這是不足懼的。（翔：譯目五月十一日西部朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>北非戰局結束</h3>
<p>如外國電訊的屢次報道，不管突尼西亞戰局怎樣變化，軸心軍在北非的使命，事實上已吿終了。以寡不敵衆的劣勢，至極長久的時間，阻止聯合軍的進攻，用反攻來應付反攻，延遲敵人的前進，吾人對德義軍的英勇奮鬥，表示十分的敬意。我人更深信德義二國人民接到此次戰報後，將更堅決其戰意，以期捲土重來。</p>
<p>軸心軍在北非的活動，始自前年九月的義軍突破埃及國境，經去年十一月以來展開的突尼西亞戰局，以至今日，計歷時二年八個月，殘剩於非洲大陸的最後立脚地，終於暫吿失陷。經營利比亞與征服阿比西尼亞，是爲了建設法西斯的非洲及地中海上的義大利帝國的重要布置。所以從北非撤退，在軍事上，在政洽上，不用說在軸心方面，尤以義國方面看來，是一個打擊。</p>
<p>因爲地中海是英帝國東西海上交通上的要路的關係，所以北非戰不僅含有對歐洲的意義，且含有對世界的意義。所謂北非戰的塲面，現正暫吿閉幕，而地中海戰即將繼之上演了。蓋英美方面除了把握住原有相對的制海權與制空權之外，事實上又佔領了從摩洛哥至埃及的北非大陸一帶，對地中海並地中海彼岸的歐洲大陸的窺伺，佔得有利的地勢了。從世界地理上說來，在此方面，今後是非洲對歐洲的戰爭。再說到法國，包含突尼西亞的北非及西非傀儡政權，與法國本國的維希政府，歐非二勢力之敵對的存在，更明顯了。但我們不能忽視北非政權立於英美方面參加戰爭的事實。</p>
<p>可是軸心方面自上月七日至十日的四日間，希特勒與墨索里尼二巨頭舉行會談，在戰爭遂行上，從所有角度加以全盤　檢討；應付北非戰局及其後局面的對策，亦曾加以充分的考慮，所以令日從容不迫對新階段正實施最善的方策。這一次從非洲大陸的轉向防衛業已充實的歐洲大陸，以鞏固其毫無間隙的防備者，蓋在今日的階段，要算最爲得策吧！敵國方面爲了國內宣傳，爲了向蘇聯的解釋，爲了誘引中立諸國，必將盡量誇張奪佔突尼西亞的重大性吧！這種誇大宣傳，不能動搖歐洲鐵桶般堅固的陣營。</p>
<p>當上月二十日祝賀希特勒總統五十四歲誕辰的時候，戈林元帥會稱：「現在的階段，是最難而又是最具有決定性的階段。不僅德意志國家，即各地德意志人民亦不能不奮鬥以越過這階段。」郭培爾宣傳都長也說：「此次的戰爭，不是各國之境界的問題，乃是各國之存亡的問題。」墨索里尼首相亦在本月五日向全國民衆提出了「我等誓必奪回阿非利加」的標語。在今日的情勢下，德義二國民衆，應充分信賴其領袖，以其號令爲至上命令，一億五千萬的軸心國民打成一片，向最後勝利的大道邁進。（翔：譯自五月十二日西部朝日新聞社論）</p>

<h3>滬西警察局長潘達談　處置刑事案件辦法　採取調查證據制度不用刑罰</h3>
<p>自張金海案發生後，社會連帶注意改善一般警政問題。記者特往訪滬西警察局局長潘達，詢問其滬西警察局對於刑事案件之如何處置，及改善警政意見，承其答復如下：</p>
<p>處置刑事案件</p>
<p>潘氏略謂：「大束亞戰爭，正在決勝時期，要促進戰爭勝利的需要條件，無疑地是前綫戰鬥的堅强，和後方洽安的確保。尤賴後方人力源源的接濟，故確保後方的治安，在對外戰爭中是一種極重要的任務，而警察的責任，便是要達到警備地區保安的目的。上海爲大東亞重要都市，又爲首都的門戶，我們擔任警務工作的人員，應負起治安的重任，除了警奸察究外，還要維持社會風化，指導市民行動。講到中國現在處量刑事案件，已採取新的偵查制度，例如滬西警察局在陳市長羅部長指導之下，依照法律，凡拘留案犯不得超過二十四小時，當解送法院，在此二十四小時伯察時間內，用各種方法，調查證據，審問案犯，不用刑罰，因爲調查證據，可明暸案件眞相，使用刑罰，案犯易遭寃屈，這是滬西警察局處置刑事案件的確情。</p>
<p>改善　政問題</p>
<p>至於改善警政，國府還都以後，已倍加注意，有長足之進步，中央設有警官學校，造就警政專門人才。即就滬西警察局面論，警官均爲警官學校出身，警察亦受過警察訓練所訓練，並且現任巡官警長，時常輪流訓練，授以三個月較深之學科術，警察亦按時回總局訓練，局內設有圖書室，以作進修，特這運動塲，以鍛統體格，備有療室，以治疾病，　皆欲健全員警之身心也。並實行新國民遝動生活，嚴令所屬擯除酬酢，衣服務須樸索，又組織消費合作社，供給低價日用品，此皆欲减少員警之消費，以剷除其貪汚之心也。</p>
<p>勗勉所屬工作</p>
<p>日昨召集員警，再勗勉工作敏捷，保護善良，刻苦耐勞，廉潔目重。近日輿論界對於改善警政及提高員警薪餉，備極關切，本人深表感謝。今後本人與所屬更當奮勉，以盡職守，始不負社會之期望，除受長官之指導外，極紛輿論界之督促也云云。</p>
<h3>迷事物捐　稽徵範圍</h3>
<p>市財政局取締迷信　業物品捐，自本月中旬始徵捐以來，本市特一特二滬西滬北南市市中心等各區營業人，照章繳捐，及領取營業牌照，該處對各項進出口之迷信事物，概由該處所屬之進出口迷信物類稽徵所辦理徵捐事宜，凡各迷信物類之營業人，均須事前至該所辦理申請手續，始得販賣，茲將稽徵摘要誌下。</p>
<p>稽徵區域</p>
<p>稽徵範圍以本市迷信物類之進口大抵來自紹興杭州（箔類）富陽（紙類）等地，出口貨大抵運往華北等地，故凡屬由關橋。羅斯福·外灘·三菱·華順·滙山·大坂·黃浦·蘭路·魚行·蘇州河·豐田紗廠等碼頭，及麥根路驛·北驛·江灣驛·南驛·龍華驛等站埠進出口區域，均在徵捐之例。</p>
<p>應徵物類</p>
<p>迷信物類之應徵捐稅者計分甲乙丙丁四類，（甲）用以製造供鬼神用香類：沉香速香降香柏香及其他香末粉類等，（乙）用以製造供鬼神用燭蕊柏脂油等，（丙）用以製造錠串冥幣之西放京放海放方　陳折粗高錫箔等，（丁）用以裂造神紙海屛之表黃大小黃尖黃元八四黃廠黃鹿鳴料海等。槪徵捐白分之十。遼者處以應徵捐額十倍以下之罰金或沒收其貨物。</p>
<h3>南市時疫醫院六月一日開幕</h3>
<p>南市時疫醫院，已擇定南市西門中華路肇　路口三樂所爲院址，於前日開籌備會議，當塲推定王永康周邦俊王振川楊之夫金學高爲籌備委員，分頭負責進行，擬定六月一日開幕，設籌備通訊處於中西藥房，並徵聘下列各項人才，翳師四人，護士長一人，鹽水間護士四人，診察室及病房護士十二人，願就者可書明履歷及所須待遇，投函籌備處。</p>

<h3>排球聯賽女組　青隊膺冠軍　甲糾東華敗白隊</h3>
<p>上海排球聯賽，昨晚四塲在中靑舉行。首塲乙一組培德以二對零勝空隊，造三戰三捷紀錄，與俄童並峙該組首席。乙二組公安二對一勝大靑，雙方實力均等，戰來緊張萬分，首盤大靑劈殺厲害。以二十一比十七吿捷，第二盤公安反攻得手，扳開一盤，來盤爲生死關頭，雙方各出全力，形勢緊張，比數兎起鶻落，精彩迭呈，結果公安以二十二對二十力取大靑，公安現以三仗俱捷之戰績與華嚴並列第一。繼之女子組軍靑隊對紅星。兩隊實力懸殊，原期一面倒局面，詎知紅星奮發，竟於弟二盤中以二十一對十五取勝一盤，總結爲二對一，靑隊奏凱，該隊遂以四戰四勝榮膺女組錦標。最後甲組一塲東華以二十一對十七，二十一對九克服白隊。</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>再論建設經濟上海的要件</h3>
<p>友邦日本名經濟學者現任上海日本商工會議所專任理事武內文彬氏，最近撰文登載大陸新報及木報，主張建設經濟上海以究成中日共興。本欄計言前曾以爲要建設經濟上海，其必要條件，爲「上海與中國各地區以及上海與大東亞共榮圈諸地域的物資交流。……換句話說，上海的工業力絕對少不了共榮圈諸地城的原料，而中國腹地的經濟支配力，也絕對少不了上海地域的產品。」茲再申論建　經濟上悔的其地重要條件如下。</p>
<p>近年來華北運滬的主要物品爲煤斤，我們應常把華北的煤斤，一類來西來餵飽上海的工廠，並以華中的五穀食物來餵飽華北及上海人民的肚子。這是建設經濟上海所有待於中國其他各地經濟合作的一點。</p>
<p>所調經濟上海，其重點即在工業上海，但欲求上海工業之振興，原料而外，又賴動力，動力之最要　即爲電力。目前上海工廠用電，限制綦嚴，欲求工作不斷，無異緣木求魚。這是建設經濟上海所有待於中國各地煤斤源源運滬的一點。</p>
<p>又所謂經濟上海，其廣義實亦包括文化上海在內；欲求上海文化之昂楊，則烟賭必須嚴禁，文化用品必須充沛與低廉，否則，在人才墮落與凋零之下，經濟上海何能建設？這是建設經濟上海所有待於禁絕烟賭提倡文化的一點</p>

<h3>農民的購買力</h3>
<p>據江蘇省建設廳的統計，農民的收入，比戰前增加了二十倍，可是生計費支出，不過十二倍弱的增加。所以農民生活已經改善多多。照理，農民的　買力電然也要增大了，可是從事實上來看農民生活，却未必有這種傾向。他們的日常起居，一切的用具，還是原始生活，没有染上一點文明氣味。那麼上面的統計是虛僞的麽？這亦不然，凡是到城市裏來的農民，不但大吃大用，就是麻將的輸贏，都在五百元，一千元左右。</p>
<p>農村的購買力，確實是增大了；可是農民不重視工業生產品，非但如此，簡直不願意去購買工業生產品。這是爲何呢？照我們的見解，這是工業品與農產品的價格不能平衡所致，我們應該考慮在何種具體形式上來啓發農民的意識。</p>
<p>農民有一種貨幣以外的價值觀念。在幣値變動不定，且有幾種貨幣並存的中國，農民必須保守個種有價値的東西，這是農民的規存觀念。譬如說，三石米，一擔棉，十擔鹽，農民就要把相當於一石米的物質和物質間的比率來估量一下，假使得到其平衡，就肯售出自己的生產物；要是失去了平衡，他總不願意賣掉自己的生產物。</p>
<p>不但是米，棉，鹽如此，就是一切的商品價格，都有一定的比率存在。產米區的農民珍視米穀，產棉區的寳貴棉，鹽民重視鹽，這些農民的價値觀念，都是事變以來，因爲物價盪動不定才產生的，而且慣重傳統的農民，依然認定舊來的觀念，不肯適應新關係。</p>
<p>農民們確具購買力，可是他們小肯把其購買力來購買工業生產品。這是農村的現實情形，使農民生活成爲原始形式的因素。爲求打破這種現狀起見，一面要使農民的價値觀念變更，一面還得要糾正現在的物價不平衡。</p>
<p>要是忽視了上面的　係，那麽增進物資收買，和農村物資交流都不容易成功。爲了要使農民的購買力運用出來，先要抑抵　業生產品的價値，須要考慮和農民的價値觀念有關的問題。（雲鵬：譯大陸新報</p>

<h3>做做好事</h3>
<p>— 雲龍</p>
<p>是那末一個夜晚，天空沒有星星，街上减少了行人。在一所曲折的小巷對面的長春館門前，躺着一個骯髒的老丐，深陷的烏珠冒出了釩火，乾癟的嘴脣迸出了求生的慘號：「餓煞啦！……老闆！……做做好事！………」</p>
<p>坐在櫃臺上鼻尖掛着老花眼鏡的王老闆，歪着嘴巴，節奏地抽着旱烟，一股股濃烟不住地從口鼻中直噴；一壁又習慣地呷了呷紅茶，嘴角上流露出淸脆的響聲。</p>
<p>突然，一個中年的堂倌跑了過來：「王老闆！拿五元錢來做好事。」</p>
<p>「做什麽好事？」王老闆推了推掛在鼻尖的老花眼鏡。</p>
<p>「今天是小月底，買些長錠結結緣。」</p>
<p>「嗯！」王老闆一本正經地從抽斗裏拿出一張五元頭的鈔票，老花眼鏡　又滑　了鼻尖：「到王大生去買，那裏的長錠，又大又多！」</p>
<p>五分鐘後，堂倌把長錠在門前焚化，王老闆啣着旱烟管踱了出來。　着熊熊的火光，臉上堆起了微笑。</p>
<p>「做做好事！……老闆！……」慘號聲尖銳地打入了王老闆的耳中。他側着頭厭惡地釘了一眼，重又踱了進來。</p>
<p>夜深沉——慘號聲由低沉而絕滅。</p>
<p>第二大早上，堂倌又向王老闆說，「做做好事，結結綠。」</p>
<p>「小月底剛過，結什麽緣？」</p>
<p>「門前老丐餓死了！」</p>
<p>「嗯！」王老闆連忙從抽斗中拿出了一張五元頭的鈔票：「去！快去買！」</p>
<p>火光又在門前跳動了，照得老丐灰白色的死臉，泛起一層薄薄的紅光。王老闆依舊啣着旱烟管對那熊熊的火光微笑，可是那老丐的脣邊却再也迸不出求生的慘號。</p>
<h3>談面孔</h3>
<p>— 龔常</p>
<p>「人心不同各如其面」這句話，是我們常常說到或聽到的，其設譬的確巧妙得很。時無論古今，地無論中外，幾會見有兩個絕對相同的面孔？人心亦復如此！同時所謂「心」是指人的「內部」，「面」是指人的「外表」，經云：「誠於衷則形於外。」例如一個內心誠懇的人，大概有一副老實的面孔，而心懷叵測的人，大槪有一副奸詐的面孔。</p>
<p>有些星相家，專會替人相面，大概就是根據這一個原理。眼光敏銳的話，也許能推斷你的性情習慣，智　才能，乃至歷世遭遇，事業成敗等等。</p>
<p>不過相人終究小甚可靠，我們不是有句古話：「以貌取人，失之子羽」嗎？老子也曾說過：「大智若愚，大勇若怯。」因爲許多有本領的人，涵養功夫很深，不容易在驟視之下，悉其底蘊。這是好的一方面，壞的　？有一班僞　者「滿嘴巴仁義道德，滿肚皮男盜女娼。明明恨你刺骨，却裝着一副喜悅的面孔，明明要你心肝五臟，却假做一種親愛的態度。偶一不愼，我們就被他欺騙了。可是欺騙朦混，僅只一時，日久下來，經過縝密考察，總會發現他的眞面目的。</p>
<p>記得鏡花緣中有一節叙述到兩面國的故事，說是那裏的人都具有兩副面孔，前面的一個是和善的，而後面用布遮掩着的一個，却是猙獰可怕的；當然是對社會的深刻的諷刺。而今社會進步了，人事複雜了，只要你稍稍留意，就知道一般所謂究得娜的人，無不具有若干副面孔！甚至一時一地一人之易，就換上一副面孔，面孔變化愈多，其人緣愈好，介愈受人欽佩，無怪乎一班人竟以面孔多變自豪了。</p>
<p>處在這種環境中的人們，應該怎樣呢？</p>
<h3>人比人氣煞人</h3>
<p>— 耶魯</p>
<p>同是圓顱方趾，而苦樂榮辱大有霄壤之別：有的如登天堂，有的如坐地獄，有的靑雲直上，有的每况愈下，……這就是所謂「人比人氣煞人」的地方。尤其在受到怨屈，碰到釘子之後的八，對這句話有更深的感覺。</p>
<p>這情形的造成，是因爲人不但有「擇業有專精，問道有先後』之分，而且更重要的還有「權勢」「背景」之類的關係——這些關係，由來已久，在健全的社會尙未建設完成之前，是莫可奈何的事情。</p>
<p>所以想得明白一點，看得遠大一點，在這些地方，不必與人比較，更不値「氣煞」的。這主意並不是「自尊」也不是「自卑」，而是因爲一個堂堂正正的人，最主要的還是在於抱定自己的理想，嚴守自己的責任。志同道合的朋友，當然越多越好；跟有些人比較而自　不如，却是大可不必的。</p>
<p>但是有些事情，像生活享受方面，不妨常有「比上不足比下有餘」的自慰——這並不是自甘滿足，實在是心有餘力不足，藉以解脫煩悶而已。</p>
<p>「人比人」之後，所起的不良結果，在社會上是常有的，例如對於有能力的人，生妒忌之心，甚至不擇手段，多方加以阻難；對於在上者則殷勤獻媚，對於在下者則壓榨欺侮。這種人本身沒有眞實本領，却具有一副壞的心腸，簡直是社會的蟊賊，不加消滅，恐怕人類「永無寗日」！</p>
<p>因此，我們所需要提倡的「人比人」的觀念，就是自己跟別人比較之後，倘使發覺自己的學問道德精神體力以及對於社會的貢獻，有遠不及人之處，就「引爲內疚」，繼之以「急起直追」，那末於社會有進步，於人於己當然都有莫大的利益。</p>
<p>所以與其人比人而氣煞人，不如「人比人」之後，「好自爲之」。</p>
<h3>可憐的笑聲</h3>
<p>— 葉樹基</p>
<p>是一個明朗的早晨，我趁在一輛到徐家滙的二路電車中，因爲是兩節一式的長車，所以並不覺得擠軋，在三等車箱裏大半是販米的，他們黃黑的瘦臉上露着徼倖的笑。起先我沒注意他們嘈雜談笑。後來，談話的聲音比較淸晰了，我才聽得一襲很使我注意的談話：</p>
<p>「頂好今朝與昨日一樣價鈿」一個　着曾燙捲過頭髮的婦人有所期望地說。</p>
<p>「嗯！今　賣×××塊，一定有人家要」是個年靑女子。</p>
<p>「我看價鈿還要漲呢！」</p>
<p>「一定還要大，」不過那邊小會馬上就漲呢！咳！今朝好賣×××塊。」一個年靑男子高興地說。</p>
<p>「這樣子就好了，今朝×××，明朝×××，×××，×××……哈哈……」年靑的女子在笑着。</p>
<p>「哈哈……這樣漲，就可以多賺些錢來多揹了些慢慢地賣脫，等它再漲，漲！漲！望它漲」婦人得意地速說帶笑，</p>
<p>「咳！希望它漲，」</p>
<p>「漲！漲！頂好漲到×××，哈哈……」</p>
<p>「哈……頂好漲到×××呢！」另外一個孩子揷嘴說了後，激起了一陣聯合的在笑。</p>
<p>「哈哈哈……」</p>
<p>這哄然的笑聲，掀動了我猶疑之波，想想他們爲什麽要希望米價上漲呢？假如，米價像從前一樣低的時候，他們決定不會再做這樣勞苦的工作，而且倒可以吃得很飽，現在他們經營了這種買賣後，整天受盡了疲勞，在於生活程度如此的高，雖然能從他們的營業上得和很厚，但是；恐怕他們連　在肩上的米也難以吃到吧！</p>
<p>爲什麽要希望他們的商品的價格上漲呢？我離開了他們一羣及電車，還是默默地自付着；當然他們是希望多賺些鈔票囉！然而，他們這些小本經紀的米販實在是够可憐的，</p>
<h3>關於禮</h3>
<p>— 小麟</p>
<p>以繁複不合人情的「禮」來束縛自己固然是大可不必，但把「禮」當作種不合四進思想與潮流　加以棄如敝展則也是不對的。</p>
<p>對於「禮」，我們應有正當的評判能力，我們知道。在人情上世俗的「繁文縟禮」是會浪費我們寶貴的光陰，减低辦事的效率，有時更使人會捨本遂末，專在「禮數」中兜圈子，生怕偶一失「禮』，便鬧出不大不小的亂子—這種「禮」是應當改革，而使它越簡越好的。</p>
<p>再有那些造成無數悲劇的封建吃人「禮敎」，不用考慮是應當推翻它的。</p>
<p>不過在另一方面來說：禮，樂記：「禮也者，理之小可易者也」，假使我們不歪曲事實來說，「禮」是不可沒有的，所謂節文者，就是「秩序」，維持社會與辦事的「秩序」是求進取所不可忽視的，否則在事業上何來「井井有序」，「有條不紊」呢？</p>
<p>再說個人方面，「禮」是個人行動的方針，依照眞正的「禮」的範疇，方始能得眞正的自由，如果一個人「蠻不講理」，也就是根本脫離了理性，那裏再可以堂而皇之托辭說是從無須有的禮數中奮鬥出來呢？一但也正有着這種欺人欺己的人存在着。</p>
<p>有一句格言說：「新智識，舊道德」，的確，別的東西可以根本推翻，唯有一禮」就不能以新舊作取捨的標凖，我國優秀的傳統便是「道德」，儘管你推陳出新，「忠·孝·仁·愛·信·義·和·平·」「永遠是我們做人的方針·這是不容否認的。</p>
<p>記得西哲說：「自由，自由，多少罪惡借汝之名而行」，這句話是同樣適合於禮的，否則滔滔者天下皆不講禮，這世界將成個什麼世界；但是小幸而竟言中，現在世界上最缺少的正是「禮」呀！</p>
<h3>苦澀集</h3>
<p>— 良月</p>
<p>狡猾的人先佔上風，老實的人後佔上風。</p>
<p>無理的自尊會鑄成大錯。</p>
<p>表面冷淡的人，多富於情感。</p>
<p>指導別人向上，是一件功德無量的事。</p>
<p>寡言者的心思最難猜測。</p>
<p>在冷靜中往往會發現許多眞理。</p>

<h3>救濟華北災黎　請滬工商界自動捐助　目標一萬萬元購糧二十萬石</h3>
<p>榮柏雲君昨來函稱：一讀十七日申報「爲華北災民請命」之社評，驚悉華北各省的空前災情，飢民遍野，每日死亡數以千百計，吾人爲人類互助的大義計，應用救災如救火的迅捷方法，進行集款，切實救濟。今申報旣代收各界捐款，敬請我全滬商號工廠，發揮同情與惻隱之心，踴躍自動捐助，以盡國民應盡之義務。譬如上海現有人口四百萬，如平均每四十人成立商號或工廠，全滬應有商號或工廠十萬戶，每戶平均捐助千元，十萬戶應有一萬萬元之捐款，用以購糧振災，當可購二十萬石，（每石連運費五百元計算）如每人日食米六合，司救二十萬人的五個月餘之久。（五個月後，如本年秋收有望，已可自給，）上海各商號與工廠經濟狀况，雖不如前，然平均一次捐千元，當能爲之。（現在的千元，不過親朋宴會之一席普通酒菜費，又譬如省下端節菜費亦可，）華北各省之災民數量，雖無統計，大約總在數百萬以上，敬請全滬商號工廠自動捐助外，尙望各殷富仁者踴躍輸將，以救華北垂斃之同胞，二方面亦積德與子孫之良機也。茲先捐上八千五百元請察收爲荷。（按賑災消息請參閱本報第四版）</p>
<h3>佛敎保嬰院參觀記</h3>
<p>佛敎保嬰院，於今年佛誕日成立，倡導者爲盛幼庵先生，盛氏爲一盛宣懷之令姪，熱心公益事業，曾在故鄉創設規模宏大之翳院，地方公益團體多　其力而克奠基礎。記者日昨特往愛文義路」四六一號該院訪問。這是一所石庫門房屋，雖不寬大，但佈置得十分整齊。小小的天井　，排列着一盆盆含笑的花兒。一位辦事小姐走出來，和藹的招待着。客堂中間供着一幅吳湖帆師弟合繪的釋迦降生像，兩旁懸着葉恭綽氏撰贈的對聯，書和畫並皆佳妙。</p>
<p>辦公室和醫療室是在樓下廂房，醫藥衛生的設備相當的完善。醫務主任殷醫師正在爲小兒注射血淸，工作十分地緊張着。後廂房二間是隔離室和入院室。小兒初入院時應在入院室住上一星期，査無傳染疾病，方可移住嬰兒室。</p>
<p>嬰兒室是樓上的兩大間屋子，床被等是那樣整潔有序的舖排着，兩三個最小的孩子正在甜密的睡夢中，幾個大的在另一間游戲。看見客來，一齊天眞地喊着「伯伯」「伯伯」。這些，在兩三星期前還在街上與死神掙扎的孩干們，如今是那麼快樂而有生氣，他們是得救了，在偉大的慈愛中得救了。</p>
<p>隨着參觀洗浴室和飮食室，布置設備，在在表現出主持者的慘淡經營。這裏孩子的飮食是根據營養標準加以科學化的管理的。有幾個孩子在初來一星期中體重便增加了一二磅。孩子們的健康及生活，每天均有紀錄。</p>
<p>雖是匆匆參觀一下，腦海中所留的印象是不可磨滅的。在這樣荊天棘地之中，有什麼比　孩子們的微笑還要美麗，還要寳貴的呢？歸來時，想起佛像旁那副對聯「長養靈根資法雨，滋培善種漑恒沙」——這兩句應該是送給董事長盛老先生和其他從事工作的諸君最好的讚語吧！</p>

<h3>The Trade Control Committee's Work Urgently Needs to Be Developed: Commercial Rights Regarding Several Regulations for Grassroots Organizations of the Trade Control Committee</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the National Trade Control General Committee, more than two months have passed. Aside from completing internal organizations and taking over the No. 7 Branch Office to continue handling visa work, there is still no news regarding the realization of the committee's fundamental tasks: "Control, Purchase, and Distribution." Our friendly nation, Japan, is so enthusiastic about returning control authority; society is so eager for the realization of control work; and various inland areas are so urgently in need of material allocation. The committee, bearing such a significant mission, should exhaust its efforts to catch up, seize "time" with "agility," promptly address the situation, and satisfy the eager expectations of the people.</p>
<p>It is reported that the committee has not yet been able to realize its fundamental tasks, mainly because its lower-level organizations, that is, the members that constitute the committee, which are also the commercial organizations that directly handle control, purchase, and distribution, have not yet been fully organized. If we study the dates of the promulgation of the Provisional Regulations of the National Trade Control General Committee, the Provisional Regulations of Industrial and Commercial Guilds, and the Provisional General Rules for the Organization of the Industrial and Commercial Association, we can understand that the delay in the realization of control work is due to the reversal of the organizational procedures. The regulations related to organizing the lower-level organizations were not coordinated in time, so the lower-level organizations that should be and could be doing things have not yet been fully established, which affects the Trade Control Committee and even the entire control work. Now that the Provisional Regulations of Industrial and Commercial Guilds and the Provisional General Rules for the Organization of the Industrial and Commercial Association have been promulgated one after another, the Industrial and Commercial Associations of various major commodities must be organized quickly to further actively promote the work of controlling materials and quickly realize the fundamental tasks of the Trade Control Committee.</p>
<p>Based on a comprehensive study of the above three regulations, there are some contradictions, and at the same time, it inevitably shows that it is nominally autonomous but actually government-controlled. We know that all wartime laws and regulations may not be as strict and comprehensive as in peacetime due to hasty formulation. However, such important laws and regulations that are jointly observed by Chinese and Japanese merchants and people were not so hastily formulated in terms of time, and it is a deep regret that they were drafted carelessly and contradict each other.</p>
<p>For example, Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations of the National Trade Control General Committee clearly stipulates that members of the Trade Control Committee (i.e., the Industrial and Commercial Association) should be supervised and guided by the Trade Control Committee when handling control matters, and the Trade Control Committee should handle matters in accordance with the orders of the central competent authorities. This is, of course, a systematic regulation. However, Article 6 of the Provisional General Rules for the Organization of the Industrial and Commercial Association elevates the status of the Industrial and Commercial Association to be on par with the Trade Control Committee, allowing it to directly handle orders from the central competent authorities (Article 6 of the General Rules states that "The Industrial and Commercial Association shall, upon the order of the central competent authorities, supervise and guide its members in handling the matters stipulated in Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations of the National Trade Control General Committee"). From a legal point of view, the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Industry are using ministerial orders to change the laws passed by the National Supreme Defense Council. From the point of view of the office system, the original purpose of establishing the Trade Control Committee was to supervise and guide its members in handling control work in accordance with government orders. Now that the various associations can directly handle government orders, why is there such a large and redundant Trade Control Committee organization? Furthermore, considering the merchants and people, they already lack research on the law, and the contradictory laws and regulations will only make them feel more at a loss. At the same time, it will lead to two serious consequences: first, it will create disputes over jurisdiction. The Trade Control Committee can completely ignore the Provisional General Rules for the Organization of the Industrial and Commercial Association jointly promulgated by the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Industry based on the Provisional Regulations of the committee passed by the National Supreme Defense Council. Because, according to legislative procedures, orders do not have the ability to change or confront laws. Second, the Trade Control Committee can shirk all control responsibilities to the competent authorities. No matter whether the committee adopts the first or second method, it will be detrimental to the future of control work, which can be asserted.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from the standpoint of commercial autonomy, the fact that all directors and supervisors of the Trade Control Committee are designated by the government inevitably gives people an excuse to violate the spirit of autonomy. The only reason can be attributed to the hasty establishment of the Trade Control Committee, which had to adopt an emergency expedient measure. However, the Industrial and Commercial Association is preparing in an orderly manner. Why is it also stipulated in the General Rules that the candidates for directors and supervisors should also be designated? The government has publicly announced the point of merchants' autonomous control in the laws and regulations, but in fact, it restricts the activities of autonomous control, which is really difficult to understand. We believe that the control system is indeed a necessary measure that must be adopted and implemented as soon as possible in the current stage of the wartime economy. We would like to provide several more opinions for the government and the Trade Control Committee to adopt:</p>
<p>(1) The government should reconsider and appropriately revise the contradictory laws and regulations. The Trade Control Committee should attach importance to its own powers and strive for them based on reason and request the government to revise them. Do not be ambiguous, so as not to affect the work effect and delay the important mission.</p>
<p>(2) Although it is a compromise to designate the directors and supervisors of the Trade Control Committee and the directors and supervisors of the established industry associations, it inevitably violates the principle of autonomy. For the industry associations that have not yet been established, the candidates for directors and supervisors must be elected by the members themselves, and the designation method must not be used again and again.</p>
<p>(3) The government and the Trade Control Committee should have a clear division of the scope and authority of control work. The government should not interfere in matters within the scope of the Trade Control Committee, and the Trade Control Committee should also recognize its responsibilities and maintain an attitude of not yielding.</p>
<p>(4) Control work is an emergency measure to stabilize people's livelihood during wartime, which is equivalent to a doctor's emergency rescue of a patient. Agility and responsibility are things that everyone who handles control work should examine at all times. We hope that the Trade Control Committee will pay more attention to this, and especially hope that the competent authorities will pay more special attention to this.</p>
<p>Autonomous control is the national policy determined by the National Supreme Defense Council; the National Supreme Defense Council is the highest authority in the country during wartime; any agency or person has an absolute obligation to abide by the resolutions of the National Defense Council; that is, any agency or person has an obligation to vigorously support autonomous control.</p>

<p>Ambassador Tani's Congratulatory Speech</p>
<p>Your Excellency Chairman Lin: His Majesty the Emperor of the Great Japanese Empire has appointed me as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Republic of China. It is my greatest honor to present His Majesty the Emperor's letter of credence to Your Excellency. It is the key to the tranquility of East Asia and the foundation of the welfare of the world for our two countries to maintain good neighborliness and friendship and enhance national relations. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, your country immediately expressed its determination to share weal and woe and provided much cooperation in both spirit and material. In the year and a half since then, the strongholds of the United States and Britain that disrupted East Asia have been destroyed, and the world of Greater East Asia is about to return to its original state. At this time, your country also rose up and joined the war. The alliance between our two countries has been further strengthened. We are supporting each other and moving forward towards the revival and prosperity of Greater East Asia. This is truly gratifying. My government deeply hopes that the governments and people of the two countries will help each other, devote their full efforts to defeat the common enemy, and complete the purpose of the war. I am now taking on this important task and will do my best to achieve this goal. I hope that your government will provide assistance so that I can complete my duties. I wish Your Excellency Chairman good health and your country prosperity.</p>
<p>Chairman Lin's Reply</p>
<p>Your Excellency Ambassador: I am very pleased to accept the letter of credence from Your Excellency, who has been appointed by His Majesty the Emperor of your country as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Republic of China. I agree with what Your Excellency said that it is the key to the tranquility of East Asia and the foundation of the welfare of the world for our two countries to maintain good neighborliness and friendship and enhance national relations. The United States and Britain have been invading East Asia for a hundred years. Thanks to your country's brave fighting, their invasion strongholds have been destroyed, and the countries of East Asia have regained their liberation. This is truly gratifying. Since our country joined the war, in the spirit of the alliance, we have devoted our full efforts to cooperate with your country in order to complete the war and revive East Asia. I firmly believe that our two countries will work together and move forward hand in hand, and we will be able to defeat the common enemy and achieve final victory. Your Excellency has served as the Director-General of the Asia Bureau and has also been stationed in our country as a Minister. You are not only familiar with the relations between the two countries, but also have insightful views. Recently, during your term as Minister of Foreign Affairs, you have been particularly enthusiastic in promoting the friendship between the two countries. Now that you are taking office, you will definitely be able to further develop your ambitions and further enhance the friendship between the governments and people of the two countries. I will definitely provide convenience and assistance to Your Excellency to complete this noble mission. I wish His Majesty the Emperor of your country good health, your country prosperity, and Your Excellency a smooth tenure.</p>

<p>Ambassador Tani's Talk</p>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - The newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Tani Masayuki, met with Chinese and foreign journalists at the Ambassador's residence at 4:00 PM on the 17th, after presenting his credentials to Chairman Lin at the National Government Auditorium at 11:00 AM in the morning, and delivered a speech on his assumption of office. On that day, Ambassador Tani wore a formal dress, accompanied by Minister Horiuchi, Secretary Shimizu, Secretary Matsudaira, Secretary Matsuo, etc. The Ambassador had a smiling face, a gentle attitude, and his eyebrows were full of heroic spirit. After each reporter presented his name card, Ambassador Tani announced his ambitions for taking office and exchanged views with the reporters. The session lasted for more than an hour before it ended. The following is a record of his talk: I was ordered to take office as the Ambassador to the Republic of China this time. I arrived in Nanjing on the 14th. Today, I had the honor to meet with His Excellency Chairman Lin and present His Majesty the Emperor's letter of credence. I am deeply honored and pleased. Due to geographical, historical, and national relations, the people of our two countries should understand and sympathize with each other, help each other, and work together for the liberation and eternal peace of East Asia. This is a natural principle. Our country has always regarded this policy as an unshakable belief. In the past, our country has made continuous efforts for this, but it is regrettable that it has not yet reached the ideal stage. The reason for this is partly due to the alienation of China and Japan by the United States and Britain, but on the other hand, it cannot be denied that the people of the two countries lack effort. Since the incident, the Japanese army has been constantly active on the mainland, using the strength of the army and navy to oppress the Yu regime. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, although only a year and a half has passed, the situation in East Asia has undergone a major change. As a result of the Japanese army's victory, the enemy's strategic strongholds in East Asia have been destroyed. Now, we are expanding our territory to block the enemy's alienation and sabotage, and on the other hand, we are ensuring unlimited national defense resources and preparing a very favorable combat posture on the front line. We are suppressing the enemy everywhere. The basic conditions for major development and the attitude of inevitable victory have been established. In terms of the overall situation in East Asia, this is a matter of profound significance. At the same time as the start of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government also expressed its attitude of sharing weal and woe with Japan. On January 9, it resolutely announced its declaration of war against the United States and Britain, formed a life-and-death relationship with Japan, and stood on the common front. Thinking of the tangible and intangible oppression of the United States and Britain for a hundred years, this is indeed the inevitable conclusion. Today, China and Japan can work together to complete the Greater East Asia War, revive Greater East Asia, and advance towards the great road of establishing a co-prosperity sphere. The future of East Asia is full of infinite light, and it is truly worthy of celebration. The Japanese Empire will complete the long-cherished autonomy and independence of its Chinese comrades and their people and give them the greatest cooperation. The current hope is to work hard to find ways to cooperate in the restoration and prosperity. I will base myself on the fundamental policy of my government and actively seek the early realization of the new policy with a firm and unwavering belief. Furthermore, I once served in Shanghai as a Minister and have also been responsible for handling Sino-Japanese diplomacy for many years in China. In the future, in the execution of my duties, I will work together with the Chinese government authorities, domestic and foreign comrades and friends to enhance the mutual understanding and cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese people and achieve the common ideals of the two countries. I am especially grateful for the cooperation of the National Government and various parties at home and abroad. Finally, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all the officials and people of the Empire residing in China for their ability to follow the Emperor's edict and the spirit of the Emperor, understand the government's policies, and do their best to serve the public. In the future, we will all work together in harmony, each secure in our own position, and each fulfill our duties to advance towards the great belief.</p>

<h3>Foreign Minister Chu's Speech</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) - Foreign Minister Chu's speech at the banquet for Ambassador Tani was as follows: Your Excellency Ambassador, Your Excellency was appointed by His Majesty the Emperor of your country as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Republic of China. This morning, you met with Chairman Lin and presented your credentials. I am hosting a banquet here to entertain you and take this opportunity to introduce my colleagues to you. I am honored by your presence. Since the establishment of the Basic Treaty between our two countries, the friendly relations between the two countries have been confirmed and are increasing day by day. I am deeply grateful for your country's sympathy and assistance over the past three years. At this difficult time, our country is devoting all its efforts to seek the revival of China internally and to protect East Asia externally. On the one hand, it is seeking to strengthen its own strength, and it hopes to use this strength to share the responsibility of building a new order in East Asia. Since our country joined the war, the alliance between our two countries has become more consolidated. Our government and people are determined to follow the spirit of the alliance, work together with your country, strengthen our cooperation, and seek to defeat the common enemy and complete the great purpose of the war. As Your Excellency is about to take office, I would like to reaffirm our country's determination.</p>
<p>Your Excellency has long been highly regarded in your country's diplomatic circles, and you have always had insightful views and enthusiasm for the relations between our two countries. In the past, Your Excellency also served in our country as a diplomat for many years and made great contributions to promoting national relations. In recent years, during your term as Minister of Foreign Affairs, you have provided more assistance to our country, such as returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights. I am especially grateful for Your Excellency's efforts. This time, you have been transferred to the position of Ambassador to China, and you will definitely be able to further develop your great ambitions based on your past understanding. You must have given careful consideration to how to cooperate in seeking victory and how to strengthen cooperation. I firmly believe that the friendly relations between the governments and people of the two countries will be further strengthened due to Your Excellency's efforts. I will provide all the convenience required for Your Excellency's duties with sincerity and assistance so that you can complete your noble mission. I now raise my glass to wish His Majesty the Emperor of your country good health, your country prosperity, and Your Excellency a smooth tenure.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Tani's Reply</h3>
<p>Ambassador Tani gave a reply immediately after Foreign Minister Chu's welcome speech. The gist was as follows: I am deeply grateful for Foreign Minister Chu's grand banquet and sincere welcome on the occasion of my assumption of office. The fundamental policy of friendship and goodwill between your country and my country has long been established, and we will continue to adhere to this policy to enhance cooperation between the two countries. This has been stated many times in the past. At the same time, your government also regards cooperation between the two countries as a basic policy, making the relationship between the two countries closer. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, you immediately issued a statement saying that you would share weal and woe with my country. On January 9 of this year, you further took the measure of declaring war on the United States and Britain, vowing to share life and death with my country. The foundation of friendly relations between the two countries has become more solid. The two major nations of Asia are pouring all their efforts into building a new order in East Asia, seeking the revival of China internally and protecting East Asia externally. This spirit of courage and progress makes my country express its greatest respect. My country is implementing its promises to return concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights, which is also a manifestation of our enthusiasm to assist your country's efforts. Your Excellency once served as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to my country and has also long served in your country's diplomacy. Due to your insight and enthusiasm, you have made significant contributions to the promotion of friendly relations between our two countries. I am especially grateful for your admiration. Now I have the opportunity to work with Your Excellency to promote the efforts to enhance cooperation between the two countries. I am especially pleased. However, in this critical situation, I am afraid that I will not be able to bear this important task due to my lack of talent. I can only use sincerity and effort to bear this heavy responsibility. I sincerely hope that Your Excellency and all the officials will give me the greatest assistance and cooperation. I raise my glass to wish Chairman Lin health and to pray for the prosperity of your country and your Excellency's health.</p>
<h3>Lin Sen's Condition Is Critical</h3>

<h3>Commander-in-Chief of the Yu-Ji-Cha War Zone, Pang Bingxun, Leads Troops to Surrender, Over 70,000 Soldiers and Officers Declare Participation in the Peace Movement</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Military Affairs Commission, the Executive Yuan, and the Propaganda Department jointly issued the following public announcement at 5 PM on the 17th: General Pang Bingxun, Commander-in-Chief of the 24th Army Group of the Yu faction and concurrently Commander-in-Chief of the Ji-Cha War Zone, and Sun Dianying, Commander of the newly organized 5th Army, deeply resent the Yu faction's collusion with the Communist Party, which harms the country and its people. They believe that with the continuous victories in the Greater East Asia War and the increasing collapse of the Anglo-American aggressive forces, this is a golden opportunity for China and Japan to work together for the liberation of East Asia. They deeply admire the National Government's leadership in the peace movement, standing with our friendly nation Japan in life and death, and declaring war on Britain and America. Specifically, on the 6th of this month, they complied with the National Government's order for a ceasefire and military demobilization with Japan, ordering all 70,000 soldiers and officers under their command to immediately cease hostilities and resolutely return to participate in the peace movement. On the 14th at noon, they issued a statement in Xinxiang, vowing to exert their utmost loyalty and efforts to complete the Greater East Asia War under the guidance of Chairman Wang of the National Government.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 17:00 on the 17th that the 24th Army Group of the Yu faction was the only direct Chiang-affiliated force in North China, continuing to resist Japan in the Henan and Shanxi provinces. Now, General Pang Bingxun, the army commander, has resolutely led more than 70,000 troops (including those under Sun Dianying) to break away from the Yu faction, support the National Government, and is willing to work towards building a new order in Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - General Pang Bingxun, Commander-in-Chief of the 24th Army Group of the Yu faction and concurrently Commander-in-Chief of the Ji-Cha Special War Zone, has declared his participation in the peace movement and led more than 70,000 soldiers and officers under his command to return. The 24th Army Group is a designation of the Yu faction, and the troops under its jurisdiction are the 40th Army and the newly organized 5th Army. Pang also concurrently serves as the commander of the 40th Army, and Sun Dianying is the commander of the newly organized 5th Army. In the past, the defense zone of the 24th Army Group was the so-called Ji-Cha War Zone. The former commander of the 40th Army was Shen Ke, and the divisions under his command were the 39th Division, commanded by Liu Shirong, and the 14th Division, commanded by Ma Fawu. Xing Suzhi is the deputy commander of the newly organized 5th Army. The total number of officers and soldiers who have surrendered this time is more than 70,000.</p>
<p>Chief of General Staff Issues Statement</p>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Generals Pang Bingxun, Commander-in-Chief of the 24th Army Group of the Yu faction, and Sun Dianying, Commander of the newly organized 5th Army, led more than 70,000 troops under their command on the 14th of this month to comply with the order for demobilization and issued a statement in the defense area, supporting the National Government and pledging allegiance to the peace movement. Bao Wen-yue, Chief of General Staff of the Military Affairs Commission, issued the following statement regarding this matter: General Pang Bingxun, Commander-in-Chief of the 24th Army Group of the Yu faction, and Sun Dianying, Commander of the newly organized 5th Army, led more than 70,000 troops under their command on the 14th of this month to comply with the order for demobilization and issued a statement, supporting the National Government and pledging allegiance to the peace movement. I am extremely gratified to hear this news. Our country's supreme leader, Chairman Wang, follows Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism, advocating peace, anti-communism, and nation-building as national policies, leading all parties and factions across the country to advance bravely, to complete China's comprehensive, unified peace, and then to achieve a true peace in East Asia based on morality and the ideal of a new world order. Therefore, from the very beginning of the National Government's return to the capital, it first issued an order for all anti-Japanese soldiers to demobilize as soon as possible and cooperate sincerely. For the past three years, although the anti-Japanese soldiers in various places have been held hostage by the violence of the Yu faction and deceived by its distorted propaganda, unable to extricate themselves, those with foresight who have returned one after another have been not few. This time, Generals Pang and Sun led more than 70,000 elite troops, stationed in the strategically important Taihang Mountains, to participate in the peace movement. Not only does our National Government suddenly gain a vigorous army and strengthen its war power against Britain and America, but the stubborn and ignorant Yu Chiang will also suddenly lose this pillar of strength, and his dream of resisting Japan to the end will inevitably collapse day by day without a doubt. Generals Pang and Sun are veterans among our country's generals. When I served as the Director of the Office of the Beiping Branch of the Military Affairs Commission, I had the honor of being their comrade-in-arms and working together in one area. I have always admired their courage, determination, and clear reward and punishment. The courage, good fighting skills, and strict discipline of their troops have long been known to the people of the country. Now, inspired by the great personality of our supreme leader and deeply disgusted by the scorched-earth and impoverished Communists, they have also keenly observed the situation after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, believing that only the joint unity of all East Asian nations can eliminate the remaining forces of Britain and America to achieve China's independence and freedom. Therefore, they resolutely broke away from Yu Chiang to jointly shoulder the great task of reviving China and defending East Asia, which further demonstrates their loyalty to the country and the greatness of their vision, which cannot be compared to ordinary followers of the trend. It is hoped that the anti-Japanese soldiers of the Yu faction, who love the country and its people and are not afraid of hardship, will follow in the footsteps of Generals Pang and Sun, resolutely rise up, and participate in the peace movement.</p>
<p>Minister Lin Xuan Issues Statement</p>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Minister of Propaganda Lin recently issued the following statement regarding the return of Generals Pang Bingxun and Sun Dianying:</p>
<p>Since the National Government's return to the capital three years ago, there have been many Yu faction generals who have deeply understood the great righteousness and returned one after another. This time, Generals Pang Bingxun and Sun Dianying, in view of the Yu faction's collusion with the Communist Party, which harms the country and its people, resolutely issued a statement on the 14th of this month, complying with the National Government's order for a ceasefire and demobilization, and led all 70,000 soldiers and officers under their command to return, participating in the peace movement and working together to revive China and liberate East Asia. This is truly inspired by the great spirit of the leader, and it is also a model for revolutionary soldiers who face the times squarely, realize the legacy of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and are admired by the people of the country. Generals Pang and Sun were formerly leaders and famous generals of the Northwest Army, and are now the Commander-in-Chief of the 24th Army Group of Chongqing and the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Ji-Cha War Zone. They have fought glorious battles during the past war of resistance. General Pang is also a general with an important position in Chongqing's military affairs. This time, leading troops to return is of extremely great significance.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Authorities Issue Statement</p>
<p>Beijing, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a telegram from a certain place on the front line in the Jin-Yu provinces, the Japanese military authorities here recently issued a statement on the return of General Pang Bingxun, Commander of the 24th Army Group and Lieutenant General of the Army, and General Sun Dianying, Commander of the newly organized 5th Army, to pledge allegiance to the National Government, as follows: The return of Generals Pang Bingxun and Sun Dianying has given a great shock to the remnants of the Yu's 24th Army Group and other troops. Therefore, they are returning one after another. The so-called anti-Japanese camp of the Yu faction in the Taihang Mountains south of the Ping-Han Railway has been completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Beijing, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Regarding the participation of Generals Pang Bingxun and Sun Dianying in the peace movement, the head of the North China Japanese Army's Information Department issued the following statement: The participation of Generals Pang Bingxun and Sun Dianying in the peace movement is truly worthy of celebration for the future of China and East Asia. Generals Pang and Sun have a full understanding of the current situation and deeply know that the relationship between China and Japan has reached a stage of sharing life and death. At the same time, the political power of the National Government is becoming increasingly strengthened, and the contradictions of the Yu faction's policies have been fully exposed. Recently, generals of the Yu faction who have joined the peace movement include Generals Sun Liangcheng and Wu Huawen. This is sufficient to show that the number of conscious people within the Yu faction's camp is increasing day by day. The return of Generals Pang and Sun with their troops this time is indeed a major blow to the Yu Chiang, who is about to collapse.</p>
<p>Pang Bingxun Issues Statement</p>
<p>Beiping, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a dispatch from the front line in the Ji-Yu provinces, General Pang Bingxun made a statement to a group of reporters after leading his troops to return, the gist of which is recorded as follows: Since the National Government's return to the capital, inspired by the great personality of Chairman Wang and in view of the current state of Sino-Japanese cooperation, I have resolved to break away from the Yu faction and participate in the peace movement. Now, witnessing the rapid progress of all construction work in the peace zone is truly gratifying. At this time, it is time for us to save the country and its people. For the sake of building and reviving China, I will devote all my efforts to the work of suppressing the Communists under the leadership of Chairman Wang. I sincerely hope that my former comrades of the Yu faction can also return to the fold as soon as possible and work together for the great cause of national construction.</p>
<p>Joint Telegram from Generals Pang and Sun</p>
<p>Taiyuan, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - After the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on the 24th Army Group of the Yu faction, numbering approximately 82,000, in the Taihang Mountains for only a week, it killed and captured up to 15,000 Yu soldiers, achieving a great victory and completing its expected goals. Now, General Pang Bingxun, the commander-in-chief of the army, because most of the generals under his command, including Sun Dianying, the commander of the 5th Army, have abandoned the resistance against Japan and pledged allegiance to the National Government, and deeply knows that Japan is sincerely assisting the National Government and that China has made a leap forward, and that the Greater East Asia War has also established a foundation for victory, has decided to lead the officers and soldiers under Sun Dianying and other generals who have already returned, totaling more than 70,000, to resolutely support the National Government and realize their long-cherished wish to suppress the Communists and save the country. In addition to ordering his subordinates to assemble, Pang and Sun jointly issued a telegram of peace in a certain place on the 14th, the gist of which is that Bingxun and Dianying, having seen the world situation and inferred the trend of public opinion, deeply know that there is no way to stabilize East Asia without participating in the peace camp, and there is no way to promote peace without suppressing the Communist bandits. Therefore, it was decided that from May 10th of the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943), we would break away from the Yu faction, support the National Government, trust our friendly nation Japan, and overthrow Britain and America, in order to complete the co-existence and co-prosperity of Greater East Asia. However, due to our shallow talent and knowledge, we deeply feel the weight of responsibility and sincerely hope that wise and advanced people will provide guidance from time to time. Currently, Sun Dianying, commander of the newly organized 5th Army, Yang Mingqing, deputy commander, Feng Deming, chief of staff, Yang Keyou, commander of the newly organized 3rd Division, Wang Tingying, commander of the newly organized 4th Division, and many other cadres, generals, soldiers, numbering approximately 20,000, and Li Zhenfen's 106th Division of the 40th Army, numbering approximately 10,000, and other troops, totaling more than 70,000, have completely assembled in a certain place, and will soon join the Japanese army as a powerful part of the National Government's army to fight against the Yu Communist army. In this way, the Yu army in North China is only left with Yu Xuezhong's troops in Shandong and the remnants of the Lu-Su War Zone, barely surviving. Since China's participation in the war, the areas of security have also been increasingly expanded. Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, General Pang Bingxun can be regarded as the first army group commander to participate in the peace camp, and the Yu faction's Ji-Cha War Zone has been completely eliminated.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Intensifies Promotion of Policies Towards China After Assuming Office, Establishing Three Cornerstones of Japanese Wartime Diplomacy</h3>
<p>Foreign Minister Shigemitsu began receiving ambassadors from various countries stationed in Tokyo on the 4th of this month and concluded on the 7th. On the 8th, he received the chargés d'affaires of Turkey, the Republic of China, Argentina, and Romania. Thus, the reception of representatives from the 19 countries stationed in Tokyo came to an end. The reception time for Ambassador Shigemitsu was one hour to one and a half hours for ambassadors and half an hour for ministers. Without the use of translators, he personally exchanged greetings and opinions with the ambassadors and ministers, achieving great results that are worthy of special mention. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's positive attitude since taking office has been of great concern both domestically and abroad. The basic policy of wartime diplomacy that the Foreign Minister insists on has three points:</p>
<p>(1) Japan's diplomatic policy will proceed in accordance with established national policies and will not undergo any changes.</p>
<p>(2) New policies towards the Republic of China and other countries in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will be vigorously promoted in the future.</p>
<p>(3) Grasp a correct understanding of the evolution of the world situation. On the first point, Japan's established national policy is naturally to defeat Britain and America, build a new order in East Asia, and establish true world peace. Diplomatic policy is also based on this and will not change due to the change of foreign ministers.</p>
<p>On the second point, the new policy towards China can best express the characteristics of Foreign Minister Shigemitsu. During his tenure as Ambassador to China, he devoted all his energy to carrying out the new policy. He has achieved many accomplishments in strengthening the National Government, in China and Japan jointly carrying out the war, and in increasing the welfare of the Chinese people. As mentioned above, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu said as soon as he took office that the new policy towards China is just beginning, and that he will pay attention to this in his capacity as foreign minister. Indeed, there is no doubt that the focus of the construction of Greater East Asia should first be on the further promotion of the Republic of China. As for the other countries in the Co-Prosperity Sphere, they should each be allowed to be in their proper place and complement each other.</p>
<p>On the third point, although Japan has military advantages in the objective situation of the world political situation and the war situation, it cannot be too optimistic. An important matter in wartime diplomacy is to always pay attention to the evolution of the situation and have a correct understanding and countermeasures. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu has served as ambassador to the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and China, and has also visited Berlin many times. He has extensive knowledge and experience and can naturally produce the most correct judgments. But in order to understand and grasp the world situation, it is felt that there is a need to send capable diplomats to Europe, and therefore it is necessary to quickly expand and strengthen diplomatic missions in Europe. The recent appointment of Counselor Nakamura of Nanjing as Minister to Finland is his first move and is worthy of attention. In this way, military affairs and diplomacy become truly integrated, advancing towards the future of victory, which is the most important thing today.

<h3>Germans Seize Initiative in Kupensk Sector, Three Soviet Divisions Annihilated, Finland Determined to Fight to the End</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram) - German News Agency military correspondent Colonel Hammer stated today: In the past two days, the initiative in the Kupensk bridgehead area has clearly shifted to the German army. German assault troops seized an important Soviet position yesterday and inflicted heavy damage on the Soviet army. Yesterday, they continued their attack and achieved special success. On the eastern front of the bridgehead, more areas were occupied, and hundreds of Soviet soldiers were captured. At least three divisions of enemy troops assembled in preparation for the attack were annihilated. All heavy military equipment was captured or destroyed. There is no important news in other areas of the Eastern Front.</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram) - German News Agency aviation correspondent Major Freda stated that in the past two days, hundreds of German fighter planes and bombers, assisted by a strong bomber force, attacked the heavy artillery of the Soviet Union in the Kupensk bridgehead, destroying most of it.

<h3>Continued Record of the Roosevelt-Churchill Conference, Future Strategies Being Secretly Discussed</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to news from Washington: Today, President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill held a meeting with senior officials for approximately half an hour, and the staff department was also engaged in debate in absolute secrecy. Churchill met separately with British Ambassador to the United States Halifax, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, and US Secretary of State, and scheduled a meeting with the British Minister of War Supply, Llewellin. Next week, Churchill will meet with Canadian Prime Minister King, and it is believed that he will also meet with Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling.</p>
<p>Geneva, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - German News Agency reports that the weekend discussions between Roosevelt and Churchill were all focused on future strategies. A Washington Times reporter said that this was the first time the two had focused on discussions since Churchill's arrival. Roosevelt had no free time to talk to Churchill individually because of his political affairs and the need to receive former Czech President Benes and the President of Bolivia. Military advisers were able to use this space to exchange views to prepare for future discussions between Roosevelt and Churchill.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a London Times report from Washington: Prime Minister Churchill may attend a meeting of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as many members of the committee wish to discuss urgent issues with the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to Swedish reporters quoting London newspapers: All sectors of the United Kingdom are holding grand celebrations for the victory in Tunisia, while the United States is showing silence. A Washington reporter for the London Observer said that the US regards the victory in Tunisia as merely a prelude and has not paid much attention to it, as all sectors of the US are looking forward to a dual offensive in Europe and East Asia. The reporter indicated that the Washington conference may have reviewed the issue of attacking East Asia, believing that since the war in Tunisia has ended, all available ships can be used entirely on the East Asian front, and the target should be Japan. Swedish reporters said that although the British side expressed sympathy for this suggestion, they are deeply concerned that an offensive in Europe will be endangered by a simultaneous offensive in East Asia. Another Swedish newspaper quoted Washington sources as saying that well-informed sources in the US believe that the victory of the anti-Axis forces in North Africa will greatly alleviate the seriousness of the agricultural labor problem in North America, as a large number of captured enemy troops will be transported to work throughout North America, and the prisoners held by the British side will be used in Canadian agriculture. The reporter continued that the US military will henceforth receive strict training from instructors who have been through the trials and tribulations of the war in Tunisia, which is another benefit of the victory in Tunisia.</p>
<h3>Davies Arrives in Tehran</h3>

<h3>British Planes Raid Germany at Night, Destroying Dams and Causing Floods; German Planes Bomb London with Heavy Bombs; Italian Town Raided, Over 400 Casualties</h3>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) – Today's official German war report stated that small teams of British planes raided Germany last night, damaging two dams, resulting in floods and many civilian casualties. Eight enemy planes were shot down, and another nine were shot down while attacking western occupied territories. Last night, German planes attacked the London area for several hours, dropping heavy bombs on military targets. Two German planes did not return.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) – According to news from London, London issued air raid alerts twice tonight. The first alert was very brief, but soon a second alert was issued. When the last news from London was received, the alert had not been lifted.</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) – German military authorities announced: On the night of the 15th, German air force used moonlight and large formations of fighter-bombers to attack eastern parts of the British mainland, bombing shipyards and naval vessels.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to news from London: When the second air raid alert was issued last night, a mysterious loud explosion suddenly occurred, clearly audible in various parts of the city. At that time, anti-aircraft guns roared incessantly, and residents were extremely shocked. However, the sound did not resemble that of a bomb exploding, and its origin has not yet been determined. Not long after the alert was lifted, a third alert was raised, as another team of German planes arrived in the suburbs of London.</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to the German military authorities: Anti-Axis air forces attacked a coastal city in northwestern Germany. The German air force and anti-aircraft artillery shot down six American four-engine bombers and eight British planes.</p>
<p>Rome, 17th (Central News Agency) – Stefani News Agency reports that a special correspondent for the Roman newspaper "Il Messaggero" detailed the recent American air raid on the town of Civitavecchia, about forty miles from Rome, stating that the American air force deliberately targeted the busiest areas. The Church of St. Anthony was completely destroyed, and the town's cathedral was also damaged. American airmen, taking advantage of the town's lack of preparedness, used machine guns to fire on civilians in the bustling streets and strafed the town's residential areas. Walls riddled with holes were visible everywhere. American planes also dropped many explosive devices resembling electric hand lamps, which exploded upon contact with a switch, injuring many women and children. Several of the town's schools were also hit, but fortunately, no students were inside at the time. According to a communiqué issued by the Italian military yesterday, the number of casualties from the enemy air raid on the town has increased to 174 dead and 300 injured.</p>
<h3>British and American General Opinion Believes Italy Will Not Be Easily Defeated</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 16th (Central News Agency) – Reuter's correspondent in New York, Empson, reports that the general opinion among New York commentators is that it will take a difficult and costly war to defeat Italy. The Anti-Axis powers must either disperse their offensive on the European continent or concentrate their attack on fronts other than Italy. Most Americans believe that the prospect of creating internal division within Italy is very distant. Radio commentator Schupert said that his impression was that the Anti-Axis powers would attack several places simultaneously instead of attacking Italy. They would take offensive action in northern and southern France and the Balkans. This would indirectly contain the same number of Italian troops, which would be no different from landing in Italy.</p>
<h3>Tunisia Implements Curfew</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to news from London: After the cessation of hostilities in Tunisia, the Anti-Axis occupying forces have announced a curfew in the city of Tunis from 8:00 PM to 8:00 AM to prevent disturbances. All power plants in the city have been destroyed, and industry and commerce have come to a standstill. The five daily newspapers published have been reduced to one by order of the authorities.</p>
<h3>Situation on Attu Island: Japanese Troops Highly Motivated, Inflicting Blows on Landing American Forces</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) – The director of the Army Press Department of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, Mr. Tanihagi, made the following statement today regarding the ground war situation on Attu Island: (1) The enemy landed on the south coast on the morning of the 12th and advanced to the front of our army's positions. Our army carried out a night attack on the main enemy force on the evening of the same day and drove the enemy back to the coastline; (2) Our army is engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy forces that landed on the north coast on the morning of the 12th and advanced to the front of our army's positions; (3) The enemy attempted to land on the east coast on the evening of the 12th and was annihilated on the coastline; (4) The enemy navy has been subjecting the island to heavy shelling and providing air cover, continuously landing follow-up troops to increase the front-line strength. Our garrison defends the positions with a small force and launches brave attacks at any time. The morale of our troops is extremely high. (5) According to reports from the field, the enemy used poison gas twice on May 14th and 15th. However, our army did not use this type of gas.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to a Washington dispatch, regarding the American landing on Attu Island, the American Navy also issued a bulletin several hours after the announcement by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters. American newspapers widely publicized it, saying that this was the first step in the counterattack in the Aleutian Islands. However, the American military authorities are very cautious, avoiding commenting on the progress of the battle on the island. Secretary of the Navy Knox, when meeting with reporters on the 14th, only said, "In this landing operation, the Navy only provided ships. The landing force is the Army. The Navy is only assisting. The operation is progressing smoothly, but it is not appropriate to predict the future." Furthermore, an Australian radio broadcast from Washington claimed that the landing American troops, due to Japanese counterattacks, only occupy the hilly and barren areas on the coast of Attu Island. The Japanese army is currently putting up strong resistance. Also, Major Eliot, a war correspondent for the News Agency, commented on the wide publicity in American newspapers, saying that Attu Island has no important places except for pontoon bridges, and the island is all mountains, making navigation in nearby waters difficult.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Active in the Southwest Pacific; Guadalcanal Bombed</h3>

<h3>The North African War Situation and the Future</h3>
<p>The North African Tunisian front took a sharp turn for the worse on the 7th of this month, with the Anti-Axis forces launching a final all-out attack on Tunis and Bizerte. The Axis forces retreated from Tunis and Enfidaville, continuing their final, determined resistance. When the Mareth Line fell previously, it was generally expected that the Tunisian bridgehead would be difficult to maintain, and the Axis forces would build a new defensive line from south of Tunis to north of Enfidaville, using the Cap Bon peninsula as their position, for a final stand. From that time on, from all military viewpoints, the Axis retreat from North Africa was only a matter of time—but despite a significant disadvantage in personnel and weaponry, they tied down a large part of the Anti-Axis forces in this area for as long as six months, engaging in a costly war of attrition. During this time, the Anti-Axis nations publicly broadcast the invasion of the European continent to the world, established a strong European joint defense posture, and made thorough preparations. Under the new operational posture, they had sufficient time to focus on the Third Summer Offensive on the Eastern Front. Therefore, the achievements of the North African garrison can be highly evaluated.</p>
<p>From the perspective of Britain and the United States, the opening of the North African front undoubtedly had the significance of a second front on the European continent. Previously, after the German army launched its second summer offensive, key Soviet areas successively fell into German hands, and Soviet Supreme Commander Stalin frequently demanded that Britain and the United States open a second front. Britain had responded to this request with small-scale bombings in German and French-occupied territories and a trial landing at Dieppe, but the European second front had not been successful. However, because Stalin's demands were extremely urgent, Britain and the United States decided to make the greatest sacrifice, colluding with Darlan to realize the North African offensive. They exaggeratedly promoted it as "the opening of the second front." Stalin naturally did not recognize this as the second front at the time. The main reason was that the British and American forces suddenly engaged in a costly war of attrition in North Africa.</p>
<p>Tracing the course of the North African war, in the early hours of December 7th of last year, a large transport fleet of British and American joint forces, with Lieutenant General Eisenhower as the commander-in-chief, suddenly began landing on the coasts of French North Africa's Morocco and Algeria. At that time, the commander-in-chief of the French army stationed in Algeria, Darlan, had colluded with the American army, and on the day after the landing began, he signed a ceasefire agreement with the invading army, and on the 15th of the same month, announced the establishment of a puppet regime in North Africa.</p>
<p>Hitler ordered the elite German troops stationed in the occupied territories of France to advance into the unoccupied zone of France. Furthermore, the Italian army also advanced into Corsica and Nice, and the Axis forces immediately transported powerful infantry and tank units by sea and air to Tunisia, seizing this key location first.</p>
<p>Prior to this, in North Africa across the Mediterranean Sea, since 1940, the Axis forces commanded by General Rommel and the British Eighth Army had been engaged in a seesaw battle in the deserts of Libya and Egypt. Rommel's army withdrew to El Agheila in early November, and continued to strategically retreat in Tobruk, Benghazi, El Agheila, and Agedabia, until January 23rd, when they abandoned Tripoli and entered the Mareth Line in southern Tunisia, joining forces with the Axis forces in that area. The Axis forces tied down the Allied forces in Tunisia, and attempted to use the activity of the air force to crush the enemy's extended supply line in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>At this time, the Axis navy had already secured the naval ports of Toulon, Ajaccio in Corsica, and Bizerte. The triangle formed by these three naval ports covered the central part of the western Mediterranean, and secured the foundation for an unshakable naval and air supremacy in that area. This situation was more advantageously deployed.</p>
<p>Due to this clever operation by the Axis forces, the Allied forces were already caught in a major supply difficulty in the North African operation, which lasted for several months. The supply route of the Anti-Axis forces in the Algerian region was not only losing many tanks and aircraft under the continuous heavy bombing by the Axis army and navy, but especially because of the activity of the Axis submarines in the Atlantic and Mediterranean waters, the losses of British and American ships reached an unprecedented amount.</p>
<p>During this period, the Axis forces were also rushing to complete the defenses of the European mainland, Sardinia, Sicily, Crete, and the Dodecanese Islands. At the same time, they were extremely vigilant about increasing the number of soldiers, tanks, and aircraft to North Africa, in order to reduce the losses there.</p>
<p>Now, the withdrawal from the vicinity of Tunisia has an impact on the Axis powers, which is not small, but in terms of the overall European war situation, it is only a local issue. The Axis defenses, which were successfully constructed during the period of the heroic battles of the North African garrison, have already become permanent positions, forming an iron-barrel-like solid front. Therefore, the strategic value of North Africa has been significantly reduced. There is no need to hold on to this place. There is no need to disperse forces in vain and continue to be consumed. This has already proven the excellence of the German High Command's head.</p>
<p>The importance of Tunis is entirely due to the propagandist schemes of the British and Americans. It is obviously intended to boost the morale of the United Nations, weaken the Axis' fighting spirit, and lure neutral countries to incline towards their camp. By the success of the North African operation, Britain and the United States have seized control of the Mediterranean Sea, maintained contact between West Asia and India, and directly threatened the Iberian Peninsula and Italy, lured Turkey into their camp, and attempted to extend their aggressive hands to the Balkans. This ambition has been shattered and thwarted in the face of the Axis' iron wall defending Europe.</p>
<p>The British and American forces are now gathering their forces in North Africa. In order to supply the troops and provide for the transport ships needed by these armies, it is said that since December of last year, it has reached 10 million tons. In the future, not only to maintain these areas, but also for the dreamed-of invasion of Europe, there will be tens of thousands of troops, which will be very difficult! Therefore, the number of transport ships required for this purpose cannot be handled by temporary re-equipment, so it is difficult to continue for a long time.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Italian navy in the Mediterranean has not been damaged at all and is still alive and well, and the power of the German submarines is also increasing. Under these circumstances, it is ultimately impossible for Britain and the United States to invade the European continent from the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>The second front they are talking about is expected to open an air second front with aircraft in the future. But the Axis forces have further strengthened their air bases in the Mediterranean, and the air defense power on the continent has also increased, so this is not to be feared. (Sho: Translated from the May 11th Western Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>End of the North African War</h3>
<p>As repeatedly reported by foreign telecommunications, no matter how the Tunisian war situation changes, the mission of the Axis forces in North Africa has, in fact, come to an end. With the disadvantage of being outnumbered, they have prevented the Allied forces from attacking for an extremely long time, using counterattacks to respond to counterattacks, and delaying the enemy's advance. We express our deep respect for the valiant struggle of the German and Italian forces. We are even more convinced that the people of Germany and Italy will be even more determined in their fighting spirit after receiving this war report, in order to stage a comeback.</p>
<p>The activities of the Axis forces in North Africa began in September of the year before last with the Italian army breaking through the Egyptian border, and continued with the Tunisian war situation that unfolded since November of last year, until today, totaling two years and eight months. The last foothold remaining on the African continent has finally been temporarily lost. The management of Libya and the conquest of Abyssinia were important arrangements for the construction of fascist Africa and the Italian Empire in the Mediterranean. Therefore, the retreat from North Africa, militarily and politically, is undoubtedly a blow to the Axis powers, especially from the perspective of Italy.</p>
<p>Because the Mediterranean is a key route for the British Empire's east-west maritime communications, the North African war not only has significance for Europe, but also for the world. The scene of the so-called North African war is now temporarily closed, and the Mediterranean war is about to follow. Because the British and American sides, in addition to grasping the original relative naval and air supremacy, have in fact occupied the North African continent from Morocco to Egypt, gaining an advantageous position for spying on the Mediterranean and the European continent across the Mediterranean. From a world geographic perspective, in this respect, the future will be a war of Africa against Europe. Furthermore, regarding France, the puppet regimes of North Africa and West Africa, including Tunisia, and the Vichy government of mainland France, the hostile existence of the two forces in Europe and Africa is even more obvious. But we cannot ignore the fact that the North African regime is standing on the side of Britain and the United States to participate in the war.</p>
<p>However, the Axis powers held talks between Hitler and Mussolini for four days from the 7th to the 10th of last month, comprehensively reviewing all aspects of war execution; countermeasures to deal with the North African war situation and its aftermath were also fully considered, so they are now calmly and unhurriedly implementing the best strategy for the new stage. This time, the shift from the African continent to defending the already enriched European continent, to consolidate its seamless defense, should be considered the most prudent strategy at this stage! The enemy country will exaggerate the importance of capturing Tunisia as much as possible for the sake of domestic propaganda, for the explanation to the Soviet Union, and for luring neutral countries. This kind of exaggerated propaganda cannot shake the iron-barrel-like solid camp of Europe.</p>
<p>When congratulating President Hitler on his 54th birthday on the 20th of last month, Marshal Göring said, "The current stage is the most difficult and the most decisive stage. Not only the German nation, but also the German people everywhere must fight to overcome this stage." Propaganda Minister Goebbels also said, "This war is not a question of the borders of each country, but a question of the survival of each country." Prime Minister Mussolini also presented the slogan "We swear to recapture Africa" to the entire nation on the 5th of this month. In today's situation, the German and Italian people should fully trust their leaders, taking their orders as supreme commands, with 150 million Axis nationals united as one, marching towards the road to ultimate victory.

<h3>Major Drought in North China; Shanghai Launches Donation Drive; This Newspaper Begins Collecting Donations Yesterday; Hoping the Entire City Will Respond and Fulfill Their Compatriotic Responsibility</h3>
<p>Since this spring, there has been a major drought in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui and other provinces. The disaster is severe, and people are struggling to survive. Now that the season is between harvests, grass roots and tree bark have been completely dug up. Starving people fill the roads, a scene too horrible to describe. All the staff of this newspaper, adhering to the principle of treating the hunger of others as our own, have managed to raise 5,000 yuan to contribute a small amount and to set an example. Since yesterday, we have been collecting donations from all sectors, and the total amount collected will be sent to the organizing groups in North China for distribution.</p>
<h3>Response from All Sectors</h3>
<p>After this newspaper's editorial pleaded for the disaster victims in North China yesterday, readers have donated over 10,000 yuan in one day. Shanghai is the financial hub and economic center of the country. Wealthy merchants, leaders of charitable organizations, and prominent figures in society are mostly righteous and eager to help. Given the tragic state of the drought in North China, anyone with sympathy will surely feel uneasy. Gentlemen from various provinces in Shanghai who have traveled to the city, looking north to their homelands, can hardly sit idly by. We dare to ask all Shanghai citizens to generously donate and assist in this righteous cause. We especially hope that donations will be sent quickly to help with the immediate needs. After the donations are received, this newspaper will issue receipts and publish the list of donors the next day to ensure transparency.</p>

<h3>Municipal Authorities Strictly Prohibit Unauthorized Demolition of Houses to Prevent Landlord Speculation</h3>
<p>The municipal authorities will take strict measures to forcibly prohibit the illegal profiteering activities of some residents who demolish houses and sell wood and bricks piecemeal to obtain high profits. The public works authorities will also assist the police in thoroughly investigating those who demolish houses without a special permit. The aforementioned measures are due to the authorities' announcement of regulations regarding rented houses to prevent landlord speculation and the illegal profiteering of secondary landlords. It is said that not long ago, the authorities conducted a thorough investigation to prevent illegal profiteering activities by landlords and learned that landlords often forced tenants to move out under false pretenses and then demolished the houses, selling the wood and bricks piecemeal in order to obtain high profits. It is now understood that all disputes should be reported to the authorities immediately so that an investigation can be carried out and the truth determined. Regarding the prohibition of unauthorized demolition of houses, the authorities explained yesterday that this measure is not only to prevent the sale of building materials on the black market but also to maintain the appearance of the city and reduce the severity of the existing shortage of building materials. Reasonable regulations will also be imposed on the profits of real estate and the profiteering of secondary landlords to ensure fairness.</p>
<h3>Mr. Sun Liangji and Brothers' Benevolent and Righteous Deeds; Donations for Educational Aid Flow Incessantly</h3>

Mr. Sun is a respected figure in the business community, having led Huiluo Company for many years. He is usually enthusiastic about public welfare and has been unremitting for a long time. This time, following the wishes of his late mother, he transferred the condolence money to support education. His benevolent and righteous deeds are worthy of admiration. The letter stated: "On the 24th of the fourth month, a memorial service was held for our late stepmother at St. Peter's Church. We are grateful to all the relatives and friends who attended and offered their condolences. We, the brothers, in accordance with her wishes, have combined the condolence money received, totaling 10,000 yuan, to support charitable causes and pray for the blessings of all relatives and friends.

<h3>Xuhua Fang in Western Shanghai Discovered to Have Inflated Population; One-Third of Food Rations are Affected</h3>
<p>In order to ensure the accuracy of the city's population and prevent the inflation of population numbers and the illegal receipt of rations, the Municipal Grain Bureau has intensified its investigation of the current population in each district. A recent investigation in the Xuhua Fang area of ​​western Shanghai has found that inflated household numbers account for nearly one-third of the population. This violation of the grain policy is deeply regrettable. In addition to continuing to send personnel to implement the investigation, the false reporting of population numbers is currently being carefully discussed in order to ensure that the distribution of rations is thorough and fair.</p>
<h3>Household Sugar - Sales Period Undetermined</h3>
<p>The third phase of sugar distribution based on household population in this city has already been approved by the Military Allocation Authority through the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office for continued allocation. It was initially scheduled for city-wide sale on the 11th. However, due to price adjustment issues, it was rumored to be postponed to the 15th, but has yet to be implemented. Citizens throughout the city are eagerly awaiting. According to the person in charge of the office yesterday, the date for city-wide sale has not yet been determined, as the price adjustment is still under review by relevant authorities. Once a decision is made, the sales date will be publicly announced.</p>
<h3>Scheduled Distribution - First Phase of Artificial Butter - Three Ounces Per Ticket, Price Eight Yuan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating: From May 21st to June 10th, retail stores selling artificial butter in the International Settlement will distribute artificial butter based on the first serial number of the artificial butter certificate. At that time, the store clearly marked with the registration number on the serial ticket will issue a quarter of a pound of "Snowflake Brand" or "Parrot Brand" artificial butter per serial ticket, priced at eight yuan, excluding retail tax. If retail stores resist or fail to comply with this notice, reports can be made to the nearby police station or the council at No. 703 for investigation.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Rectifies City Appearance - Begins Road Administration Reform - Repairs Damaged Road Surfaces and Renovates Old Buildings</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council in the International Settlement is sparing no effort in rectifying the city's appearance. Earlier this month, it held a one-week street cleaning campaign, achieving considerable success. Recently, the authorities have taken further measures to rectify road administration in order to thoroughly improve the city's appearance.</p>
<p>Repair of Damaged Road Surfaces Begins</p>
<p>In recent years, the depreciation of roads within the settlement has been significant, and damaged road surfaces and sidewalks can be found everywhere. Now, the Public Works Department has begun repairing these roads. Projects that have already started include Medhurst Road, Yu Yuen Road, and Muirhead Road. In addition, efforts are also underway to level out some gravel roads.</p>
<p>Renovation of Old Houses</p>
<p>It has been found that some buildings along the roads are dilapidated and may collapse at any time. This situation not only damages the appearance but also endangers the lives of citizens. The authorities have now ordered homeowners to repair or rebuild to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>Street Cleaning Work Continues</p>
<p>Although Street Cleaning Week has passed, street cleaning work has not stopped. The Public Works Department continues to dispatch a large number of cleaners to carry out cleaning and washing of road surfaces on various roads. Baojia personnel are also mobilized to assist in maintaining public health.</p>
<h3>Disease Prevention Inoculation Campaign - Continues to Advance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department is actively promoting the disease prevention inoculation campaign. It is reported that most of the residents in the International Settlement have completed the inoculation. A small number of residents have evaded inoculation. The Baojia heads have been instructed to investigate, advise household by household for inoculation, in order to maintain public health during the summer. The Chengdu district is even stricter, with measures including punishment for those who have not been inoculated. Additionally, health personnel from each Baojia take turns to check the epidemic prevention certificates of pedestrians on roads in the section. Those without certificates will be inoculated. Therefore, good results are expected.</p>
<h3>East Asia Shipping Company Plans to Increase - Yangtze River Route Freight Rates - Will Apply to the Japanese Maritime Affairs Bureau for Approval</h3>
<p>According to the Da Tong News Agency, sources in the shipping industry say that the East Asia Shipping Company has decided to increase the freight rates for high-priced goods on the Yangtze River route. This proposal will be implemented after approval by the Japanese Maritime Affairs Bureau. According to the company's current regulations for freight rates on the Yangtze River route, goods worth more than 4,000 yuan per ton are classified as high-priced goods, which are divided into three levels: (1) Shanghai to Nanjing and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, a charge of 4%; (2) Shanghai to Anqing and Wuhu, a charge of 5%; (3) Shanghai to Jiujiang and Hankou, a charge of 6%. The reason for the price increase is that the transportation of high-priced goods involves a greater burden, hence the need to increase their freight rates.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Pawnshops Change Their Appearance - Police Investigation and Prohibition - Pawn Tickets Renamed "Consignment Sales Certificates," Pledges Forfeited After Seven Days</h3>
<p>The small pawnshops in the Nanshi area of Laoximen, Zhonghua Road, Minguo Road, Fangbang Road, Tongqing Street, Nanyang Bridge, and Xiaobeimen Luxiangyuan Yan'an Road specialize in extracting exorbitant interest from the poor. The pledged items are forfeited after two or four months. Even pawn tickets can be re-mortgaged, harming society. After investigation by the Municipal Police Bureau, large pawnshops that have not registered with the authorities and do not have a business license have been ordered to be sealed off and are not allowed to operate. All pledged goods are to be redeemed within a limited time. However, as time goes on, new tricks are played. Recently, there have been disguised pawnshops and so-called "commercial firms" and "shops" that have been sealed but have changed their appearance. Their "pawn tickets" issued by these shops are beautifully renamed "Limited Price Fixed-Term Consignment Sales Certificates," which are even more intensified. The "certificates" bear the words "Negotiated Daily" and "Limited Price Fixed-Term Consignment Sales Rules" with ten very harsh articles. Some also print "Redeem Pawn Tickets for Customers" and "Purchase Various Pawn Tickets," stating, "In order to give preferential treatment to sellers, this store will keep the purchased pawn tickets for seven days. During this period, the principal can be prepared to redeem them, but a handling fee will be added. If they are not redeemed after the deadline, they will be treated as waste paper. It is then considered abandoned at free will, and will be sold to return to the principal, and there will be no objection. If the origin is unknown, this store is not involved." It is now known that the police station yesterday ordered the relevant police stations to secretly investigate and prohibit them. Violators will be severely punished and will not be tolerated.</p>
<h3>French Authorities Issue Proclamation - To Curb Abuse of Power by Subordinates - Public Requested to Report Information for Punishment</h3>
<p>To curb abuse of power and illegal activities by subordinates, the French Consul General, Mr. Mazereau, issued a proclamation yesterday, hoping that the public would report information to achieve cooperation. The original text of the proclamation reads: "Recently, there have been cases of abuse of power in the management of commodity prices and the crackdown on illegal activities. All have been subjected to the most severe punishment. It should be noted that due to the current circumstances, it is often difficult to implement measures to protect the public interests of residents. This authority believes that the effective elimination of abuse of power requires the full cooperation of the public. In the future, if public officials, contacts, or self-proclaimed contacts engage in illegal activities, even if they are minor, they should be reported to the French Police Superintendent. Only in this way can they be punished."</p>
<h3>Zhang Jinhai's Pension - Has Been Delivered to the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>In the case of Zhang Jinhai, an apprentice at Chengji Shirt and Socks Shop, who was beaten to death by French police, after the Shanghai Municipal Government filed a protest with the French authorities, the French side agreed to punish the murderer and apologize, and sent a pension of 100,000 yuan to the Municipal Government to be forwarded to Zhang Jinhai's family. It is reported that the Municipal Government has notified Zhang Jinhai's family to find a reliable guarantor and come to the government to collect it in person.</p>
<p>In addition, in the tragic death of Zhang Jinhai, the defendants Guo Shiyuan and others have been transferred to the Second Special Court for detention. It is now learned that the Second Court has clarified the case and will hold a public trial in the First Tribunal in the near future. Regarding the injury of Peng Shuanglong, Peng's family has also hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Special Court.</p>
<h3>Oil Painting Exhibition of Ms. Zhang Liying - Opened Yesterday at the Metropole Hotel</h3>
<p>Ms. Zhang Liying, wife of Chen Youren, is passionate about art. She studied abroad, observed world-renowned paintings, and explored the world's customs and sentiments. Wherever she traveled, her art bag followed. Her oil paintings are all carefully crafted. She has held several solo exhibitions and participated in salons abroad, gaining international fame in the art world and receiving admiration from internationally renowned artists. Taking advantage of her trip to Shanghai, she is exhibiting a portion of her works in the large guest room of the Metropole Hotel at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road. Admission is free, and the works are not for sale, making it a purely artistic solo exhibition, adding a unique color to the Shanghai art scene. Yesterday (the 17th) at 4:00 PM, the opening of Ms. Zhang's oil painting solo exhibition was attended by more than 300 people, including Yan Junren, Li Bake, Zhao Shuyong, Xu Liqu, Chen Binhe, the president of the Times, Futada Ichioka, Major Okamura, Yoshida Toyu, and Chinese, Japanese, German, and Italian art lovers, journalists, and cultural figures. Ms. Zhang and Mr. Chen Yiren greeted the guests with smiles at the venue. The Metropole Hotel was decorated splendidly and magnificently, with soft lighting and a quiet environment, making it ideal for displaying high-end artistic works. All of the approximately 50 oil paintings are mostly sketches of folk customs and the lives of ordinary people in southern China. With the lady's superb painting skills, the appreciators greatly praised. It is heard that the individual exhibition will be open to the public from today to the 22nd, from 10 am to 6 pm daily, and welcomes those high-minded people who love art to visit.</p>

<h3>Interview with Pan Da, Director of the Huxi Police Bureau - Methods for Handling Criminal Cases - Adopting an Evidence-Based Investigation System Without Torture</h3>
<p>Since the Zhang Jinhai case occurred, society has paid attention to improving general policing issues. The reporter specifically visited Pan Da, Director of the Huxi Police Bureau, to inquire about how the Huxi Police Bureau handles criminal cases and his opinions on improving policing. He replied as follows:</p>
<p>Handling Criminal Cases</p>
<p>Mr. Pan said briefly: "The Great East Asia War is in its decisive phase. The necessary conditions for promoting the victory of the war are undoubtedly the strength of the frontline combat and the security of the rear. It depends particularly on the steady supply of manpower to the rear. Therefore, ensuring the security of the rear is an extremely important task in the foreign war, and the responsibility of the police is to achieve the purpose of ensuring the security of the security area. Shanghai is an important city in East Asia and the gateway to the capital. Personnel engaged in police work should shoulder the important responsibility of maintaining social security. In addition to police investigation, it is necessary to maintain social morality and guide citizens' actions. Speaking of China's current handling of criminal cases, it has adopted a new investigation system. For example, under the guidance of Mayor Chen and Minister Luo, the Huxi Police Bureau, in accordance with the law, shall not detain criminals for more than 24 hours before sending them to the court. Within these 24 hours, we use various methods to investigate evidence, interrogate criminals, and do not use torture. Because investigating evidence can clarify the truth of the case, and using torture can easily lead to injustice for the criminals. This is the sure thing in the Huxi Police Bureau's handling of criminal cases.</p>
<p>Improving Policing Issues</p>
<p>As for improving policing, the National Government has paid more attention since the return to the capital, and there has been considerable progress. The central government has established a police academy to train police professionals. Even looking at the Huxi Police Bureau, the police officers are all graduates of the police academy, and the police have also undergone training at the police training institute. Moreover, the current patrol officers and sergeants are often rotated for training, teaching them more in-depth academic subjects for three months. The police also return to the headquarters for training on time. The bureau has a library for further study, a special sports ground to strengthen physical fitness, and a medical room to treat diseases. All these are intended to strengthen the physical and mental health of the police. We also implement the New National Life Movement, strictly ordering subordinates to eliminate socializing and require clothing to be simple. We also organize consumer cooperatives to supply low-priced daily necessities, all in order to reduce the consumption of police officers and eliminate their desire for corruption.</p>
<p>Encouraging Subordinate Work</p>
<p>Yesterday, he summoned the police officers and encouraged them to work quickly, protect the good, endure hardship, and be honest and self-respecting. Recently, the media has been extremely concerned about improving policing and increasing police salaries, for which I am deeply grateful. In the future, I and my subordinates should work harder to fulfill our duties, so as not to fail the expectations of society. In addition to receiving the guidance of our superiors, we also seek the supervision of the media.</p>
<h3>Tax on Superstitious Items - Scope of Collection</h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau's crackdown on superstitious goods tax. Since the collection of taxes began in mid-May, business operators in various districts of the city, including Special Zone One, Special Zone Two, Huxi, Hubei, Nanshi, and the city center, have been paying taxes in accordance with regulations and obtaining business licenses.

<p>The scope of tax collection is that the import of superstitious goods into the city mostly comes from Shaoxing, Hangzhou (foil), Fuyang (paper), and other places, and the export goods are mostly transported to North China and other places.

<h3>Nanshi Epidemic Hospital to Open on June 1st</h3>

Public Security is now tied for first place with Huayan with a record of three wins. Then, in the women's group, the Military Qing Team played against the Red Star Team. The strengths of the two teams were very different, and a one-sided situation was expected. Unexpectedly, Red Star performed very well and won one set 21-15 in the second set, resulting in a final score of 2-1. The Qing Team won, and the team won the women's group title with four wins and four wins. In the last A group match, Donghua defeated White Team 21-17, 21-9.</p>

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Further Discussion on the Key Elements of Building an Economic Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mr. Takeuchi Fumin, a well-known Japanese economist and current full-time director of the Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce, recently wrote articles published in the Mainland News and this newspaper, advocating the construction of an economic Shanghai to realize the co-prosperity of China and Japan. This column has previously stated that the necessary conditions for building an economic Shanghai are "the exchange of goods between Shanghai and various regions of China, as well as between Shanghai and the regions of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere... In other words, Shanghai's industrial power absolutely cannot do without the raw materials from the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the economic dominance of the Chinese hinterland absolutely cannot do without the products of the Shanghai region." Now, let us further discuss the other important conditions for building an economic Shanghai as follows.</p>
<p>In recent years, the main items transported from North China to Shanghai have been coal. We should always use the coal from North China to feed Shanghai's factories and use the grains and food from Central China to feed the bellies of the people of North China and Shanghai. This is a point of economic cooperation between the economic construction of Shanghai and other parts of China.</p>
<p>The so-called economic Shanghai is focused on industrial Shanghai, but in order to revitalize Shanghai's industry, in addition to raw materials, it also relies on power, and the most important of power is electricity. At present, the electricity consumption of Shanghai factories is severely restricted. To seek uninterrupted work is tantamount to climbing a tree to catch a fish. This is a point that depends on the continuous transportation of coal from various parts of China to Shanghai for the construction of economic Shanghai.</p>
<p>Moreover, the so-called economic Shanghai, in a broad sense, also includes cultural Shanghai. In order to promote Shanghai's culture, smoking and gambling must be strictly prohibited, and cultural goods must be abundant and inexpensive. Otherwise, with the decline and withering of talent, how can economic Shanghai be built? This is a point that depends on the prohibition of smoking and gambling and the promotion of culture for the construction of economic Shanghai.</p>

It stipulates that all loans issued by various banks and stores with commodities as collateral shall be reported by the Banking Industry Association and transferred to the local competent authority for record. It is reported that the Shanghai Special Municipality Economic Bureau has prepared a "Survey Form for Commodity Secured Loans in the Banking Industry" and notified the Banking Industry Association to ask its members to fill it out. The contents of the form are recorded as follows: (1) Reporting unit, address, company registration license number, year, month, and day. (2) Borrower, individual's name, occupation, company name, representative. (3) Address. (4) Loan amount. (5) Term, start and end date. (6) Name of collateralized commodity. (7) Unit quantity.

In addition, various banks and stores shall refuse to issue commodity secured loans to commodity firms that have not been approved for registration and are not members of the trade association in accordance with laws and regulations.</p>
<h3>Non-commercial warehouses - Will also be investigated recently</h3>
<p>In order to eliminate the evil trend of hoarding in the International Settlement area of this city, the Bureau of Materials Control of the Shanghai Municipal Council has taken the same steps as the Municipal Government to investigate the inventories of all 175 commercial warehouses in the area under its jurisdiction. It is expected that all investigation work can be completed by the end of this month. It is learned that the number of various goods hoarded by merchants in this city and stored in commercial warehouses is indeed not small, but the quantity stored in privately owned non-commercial warehouses or small freight yards is also considerable. In view of this, and in order to fully understand the actual quantity of various goods stored in this port, the Bureau of Materials Control of the Shanghai Municipal Council has decided to conduct a thorough investigation of the inventories in privately owned non-commercial warehouses or small freight yards in the near future.</p>

<h3>Spring Cocoons Enter the Market: Manufacturers Begin Purchasing, Fresh Cocoon Prices Determined According to Silk Reeling Yields, Native Varieties Calculated at 75% of Improved Varieties</h3>
<p>The spring cocoon season has begun in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Silk manufacturers and remaining cocoon merchants, having secured loans from banks and money houses, are settling cocoon transactions to purchase spring cocoons. Scales have already opened in places such as Yuhang, Hangzhou, Hai'ning, and Xiashi, while Jiaxing and Wuxi in Jiangsu Province will open scales successively. Regarding the standard price of spring cocoons, this reporter learned from silk cocoon merchants yesterday that the authorities have assessed the price as follows: (1) For improved variety fresh cocoons with a reeling yield of 380 catties, the price is 2,200 yuan per dan. For a reeling yield of 420 catties, the price is 1,800 yuan per dan. (2) The price of native variety fresh cocoons is calculated at 75% of the improved variety price. The spring cocoons purchased are permitted to be transported freely for silk reeling in various silk factories. Silk factories in the Shanghai International Settlement will begin silk reeling once the first batch of spring cocoons arrives in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>The Purchasing Power of Farmers</h3>
<p>According to statistics from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction, farmers' incomes have increased twentyfold compared to pre-war levels, while living expenses have only increased slightly less than twelvefold. Therefore, the lives of farmers have improved significantly. Logically, the purchasing power of farmers should also have increased. However, based on actual observations of farmers' lives, this is not necessarily the case. Their daily lives and all their tools still reflect a primitive lifestyle, untouched by any semblance of civilization. Does this mean that the statistics above are false? Not necessarily. Farmers who come to the cities not only spend lavishly but also gamble at mahjong, with wins and losses ranging from 500 to 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The purchasing power of rural areas has indeed increased, but farmers do not value industrial products; in fact, they are unwilling to purchase them. Why is this? In our opinion, this is due to the imbalance between the prices of industrial products and agricultural products. We should consider in what specific form to enlighten farmers' awareness.</p>
<p>Farmers have a value system beyond currency. In China, where currency values fluctuate and several currencies coexist, farmers must preserve things of value. This is the farmers' concept of preservation. For example, farmers will evaluate the equivalent value of three shi of rice, one dan of cotton, and ten dan of salt in terms of the ratio between one shi of rice and other materials. If they find it balanced, they will be willing to sell their products; if it is unbalanced, they will be unwilling to sell.</p>
<p>This applies not only to rice, cotton, and salt but also to all commodity prices, which have a fixed ratio. Farmers in rice-producing areas cherish rice, farmers in cotton-producing areas value cotton, and salt farmers value salt. These farmers' value systems have emerged since the incidents because of fluctuating prices. Moreover, farmers who value tradition still adhere to the old concepts and are unwilling to adapt to the new relationships.</p>
<p>Farmers certainly have purchasing power, but they are unwilling to use it to purchase industrial products. This is the reality in rural areas, which makes farmers' lives a primitive form. To break this status quo, we must not only change farmers' value systems but also correct the current price imbalance.</p>
<p>If we ignore the relationship above, it will not be easy to increase the purchase of materials and the exchange of materials in rural areas. To enable farmers to utilize their purchasing power, we must first suppress the value of industrial products and consider issues related to farmers' value systems.

<h3>Doing a Good Deed</h3>
<p>— Yun Long</p>
<p>It was such a night, the sky without stars, the streets with fewer pedestrians. In front of the Changchun Pavilion across from a winding alley, an old, dirty beggar was lying, his sunken dark eyes emitting a glimmer, his withered lips bursting out cries for survival: "Starving! … Boss! … Do a good deed! …"</p>
<p>Boss Wang, sitting at the counter with old glasses hanging on the tip of his nose, puffed on his dry tobacco pipe, his mouth twisted, thick smoke continuously blasting from his nose and mouth; at the same time, he sipped his black tea habitually, clear sounds from his mouth.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a middle-aged waiter ran over: "Boss Wang! Take five yuan to do a good deed."</p>
<p>"What good deed to do?" Boss Wang pushed up the old glasses hanging on the tip of his nose.</p>
<p>"Today is the end of the lunar month, buy some joss paper to make connections."</p>
<p>"Hmm!" Boss Wang took out a five-yuan bill from the drawer in a serious manner, and the old glasses slid down again onto the tip of his nose: "Go to Wang Dasheng to buy, their joss paper are big and plentiful!"</p>
<p>Five minutes later, the waiter burned the joss paper in front of the door, and Boss Wang, with his dry tobacco pipe in his mouth, strolled out. Looking at the raging fire, his face filled with a smile.</p>
<p>"Do a good deed! … Boss! …" A sharp cry pierced Boss Wang's ears. He tilted his head and glared with disgust, then strolled back in again.</p>
<p>The night deepened — the cries faded from low to extinguished.</p>
<p>The next morning, the waiter said to Boss Wang again, "Do a good deed, to make connections."</p>
<p>"The end of the small lunar month has just passed, what connections to make?"</p>
<p>"The old beggar in front of the door starved to death!"</p>
<p>"Hmm!" Boss Wang quickly took out a five-yuan bill from the drawer: "Go! Go buy it quickly!"</p>
<p>The fire was dancing again in front of the door, shining a thin red light on the old beggar's pale dead face. Boss Wang still smiled at the raging fire with his dry tobacco pipe in his mouth, but the old beggar's lips could no longer burst out cries for survival.</p>
<h3>Talking About Faces</h3>
<p>— Gong Chang</p>
<p>"People's hearts are as different as their faces" is a phrase we often say or hear, and its analogy is indeed very clever. Whether in ancient or modern times, whether at home or abroad, how often do you see two absolutely identical faces? People's hearts are the same! At the same time, the so-called "heart" refers to a person's "internal," and "face" refers to a person's "external." The sutras say: "Sincerity within is manifested without." For example, a sincere person probably has an honest face, while a treacherous person probably has a cunning face.</p>
<p>Some physiognomists specialize in reading faces, probably based on this principle. With sharp eyesight, they may be able to deduce your temperament, habits, intelligence, talents, and even past experiences, career success, and so on.</p>
<p>However, judging people by appearances is not very reliable after all. Don't we have an old saying: "Judging people by appearances, you lose Ziyu"? Lao Tzu also said: "Great wisdom appears foolish, great courage appears timid." Because many talented people have deep cultivation and are not easily understood at first glance. This is the good side. What about the bad side? There is a group of hypocrites who "preach benevolence and morality, but harbor wickedness. They hate you to the bone, but put on a happy face; they want your heart and liver, but pretend to be affectionate. If we are not careful, we will be deceived by them. But deception and confusion are only temporary. Over time, after careful investigation, we will always discover their true faces.</p>
<p>I remember a section in *Flowers in the Mirror* that describes the story of the Two-Faced Kingdom, saying that the people there all have two faces, the front one is kind, and the one covered with cloth behind is hideous and terrifying; of course, it is a profound satire of society. Now that society has progressed and personnel have become more complex, as long as you pay a little attention, you will know that those so-called successful people all have several faces! Even with the change of time, place, and person, they change a face. The more faces change, the better the person's popularity, and the more they are admired. No wonder a group of people are proud of their ever-changing faces.</p>
<p>What should people do in this environment?</p>
<h3>Comparing People Makes One Furious</h3>
<p>— Yale</p>
<p>Being both round-headed and square-footed, happiness, suffering, honor, and disgrace vary greatly: some seem to ascend to heaven, some seem to sit in hell, some rise rapidly, and some deteriorate… This is what is meant by "comparing people makes one furious." Especially when subjected to grievances and encountering setbacks, one feels this saying more deeply.</p>
<p>This situation is caused because people not only have differences in "choosing a career with expertise and asking for guidance with precedence," but also, more importantly, there are relationships like "power" and "background"—these relationships have existed for a long time, and before a healthy society is fully constructed, it is an inescapable matter.</p>
<p>So, if you think clearly and see farther, you don't have to compare yourself with others in these areas, and it's not worth being "furious" about. This idea is neither "self-esteem" nor "self-abasement," but because the most important thing for an upright person is to hold on to his ideals and strictly adhere to his responsibilities. The more like-minded friends, the better, of course; but comparing yourself with some people and being inferior is not necessary.</p>
<p>But in some matters, such as the enjoyment of life, you may as well often have the self-comfort of "more than enough compared to those below." This is not self-satisfaction; it is simply that the heart is willing but the strength is insufficient, so as to relieve boredom.</p>
<p>The bad consequences caused by "comparing people" are common in society. For example, some people become jealous of capable people and even use unscrupulous means to obstruct them in various ways; they are diligent and flattering to those above them, and they oppress and bully those below them. These people have no real ability themselves but have a bad heart. They are simply pests of society. If they are not eliminated, I am afraid that mankind will "never have a peaceful day"!</p>
<p>Therefore, the concept of "comparing people" that we need to promote is that after comparing ourselves with others, if we find that our knowledge, morality, spirit, physical strength, and contributions to society are far inferior to others, we should "take it as an internal reproach" and then "catch up quickly," so that society will progress, and naturally there will be great benefits to both people and ourselves.</p>
<p>Therefore, rather than being furious after comparing people, it is better to "take care of yourself" after "comparing people."</p>
<h3>Pitiful Laughter</h3>
<p>— Ye Shuji</p>
<p>It was a bright morning. I was on a No. 2 streetcar to Xujiahui. Because it was a long car with two sections, it didn't feel too crowded. Most of the people in the third-class carriage were rice vendors, their yellowish-black skinny faces revealing smug smiles. At first, I didn't pay attention to their noisy chatter. Later, the sound of their conversations became clearer, and I heard a conversation that made me pay attention:</p>
<p>"It would be best if today's price is the same as yesterday's." A woman with permed hair said with some expectation.</p>
<p>"Hmm! If it sells for ××× today, surely someone will want it." This was a young woman.</p>
<p>"I think the price will go up even more!"</p>
<p>"It will definitely go up a lot, but the association there will raise the price soon! Alas! It would be good to sell for ××× today." A young man said happily.</p>
<p>"That would be good, ××× today, ××× tomorrow, ×××, ×××… Haha…" The young woman was laughing.</p>
<p>"Haha… if it rises like this, you can earn more money to carry more and sell it slowly, waiting for it to rise again, rise! Rise! Hoping it will rise." The woman said quickly and triumphantly, with a smile.</p>
<p>"Alas! Hoping it will rise."</p>
<p>"Rise! Rise! It would be best if it rises to ×××, haha…"</p>
<p>"Ha… it would be best if it rises to ×××!" Another child interjected, inciting a united laughter.</p>
<p>"Hahaha…"</p>
<p>This burst of laughter stirred up the waves of my hesitation. Why do they want the price of rice to rise? If the price of rice were as low as before, they would definitely not do such laborious work, and they could eat their fill. Now that they are engaged in this business, they are exhausted all day long. With the cost of living so high, although they can earn a lot from their business, I am afraid they can hardly eat the rice that is on their shoulders!</p>
<p>Why do they want the prices of their goods to rise? I left their group and the streetcar, still silently paying my fare; of course, they hope to earn more money! However, these small rice dealers are indeed pitiful.</p>
<h3>On Propriety</h3>
<p>— Xiao Lin</p>
<p>It is certainly unnecessary to bind oneself with complex and inhumane "propriety," but it is also wrong to discard "propriety" as something that does not conform to the progressive thinking and trends.</p>
<p>Regarding "propriety," we should have a proper ability to judge. We know that in human relations, worldly "red tape" will waste our precious time and reduce the efficiency of doing things. Sometimes, it even leads people to abandon the fundamental and pursue the trivial, focusing solely on "etiquette," fearing that even a slight mistake in "propriety" will cause a major or minor mess—this kind of "propriety" should be reformed and made as simple as possible.</p>
<p>Furthermore, those feudal, man-eating "ethical principles" that have caused countless tragedies should be overthrown without any consideration.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, "propriety" is indispensable. As the Record of Music says: "Propriety is the smaller, more easily changed principle of reason." If we do not distort the facts, "propriety" is indispensable. The so-called "formal regulations" are "order." Maintaining "order" in society and in doing things is essential for progress; otherwise, how can we have "orderly" and "methodical" work in our careers?</p>
<p>Moreover, on a personal level, "propriety" is a guideline for individual actions. Only by following the true scope of "propriety" can we obtain true freedom. If a person is "unreasonable," that is, completely divorced from reason, how can he plausibly claim to have struggled out of unnecessary propriety? However, there are indeed people who deceive themselves and others in this way.</p>
<p>There is a maxim that says: "New knowledge, old morality." Indeed, other things can be completely overthrown, but only "propriety" cannot be judged by new and old standards. Our excellent tradition is "morality." No matter how much you innovate and change, "loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, harmony, and peace" will always be our guiding principles. This is undeniable.</p>
<p>I remember a Western philosopher saying: "Freedom, freedom, how many crimes are committed in your name." This saying is equally applicable to propriety; otherwise, if everyone in the world does not practice propriety, what kind of world will this be? Unfortunately, it seems to be the case. What the world lacks most now is "propriety"!</p>
<h3>Collection of Bitterness</h3>
<p>— Liang Yue</p>
<p>The cunning take the upper hand first, the honest take the upper hand later.</p>
<p>Unreasonable self-esteem will lead to big mistakes.</p>
<p>People who seem cold on the surface are often rich in emotions.</p>
<p>Guiding others to improve is a meritorious act.</p>
<p>The thoughts of the taciturn are the most difficult to guess.</p>
<p>Many truths are often discovered in calmness.</p>

<h3>Appeal to Shanghai's Business and Industrial Circles to Voluntarily Donate to Relief for North China Disaster Victims, Goal of 10 Million Yuan to Purchase 200,000 Shi of Grain</h3>
<p>Mr. Rong Boyun wrote yesterday, saying: After reading the editorial "Appeal on Behalf of North China Disaster Victims" in the 17th issue of Shen Bao, I was shocked to learn about the unprecedented disaster situation in the provinces of North China, where famine victims are everywhere, and the number of deaths is in the hundreds and thousands every day. For the sake of human mutual aid, we should use the speedy method of disaster relief as firefighting to collect funds and provide effective relief. Now that Shen Bao is collecting donations from all walks of life on behalf, I respectfully request all Shanghai commercial firms and factories to show compassion and sympathy and actively donate to fulfill the obligations of a citizen. For example, Shanghai currently has a population of four million. If, on average, every forty people establish a commercial firm or factory, there should be 100,000 commercial firms or factories in Shanghai. If each household donates an average of 1,000 yuan, the 100,000 households should have a donation of 100 million yuan, which can be used to purchase grain for disaster relief and can purchase 200,000 shi (calculated at 500 yuan per shi including shipping costs). If each person eats six he of rice per day, it can save 200,000 people for more than five months (after five months, if a harvest is hoped for this year, it can be self-sufficient). Although the economic conditions of Shanghai's commercial firms and factories are not as good as before, they should be able to donate an average of 1,000 yuan at a time (the current 1,000 yuan is only the cost of an ordinary banquet meal with friends, or, for example, saving the cost of the Dragon Boat Festival dishes is also possible). Although there are no statistics on the number of disaster victims in the provinces of North China, it is roughly more than several million. In addition to the voluntary donations from Shanghai's commercial firms and factories, I also hope that wealthy philanthropists will actively contribute to save our dying compatriots in North China, which is also a good opportunity to accumulate virtue for future generations. I am donating 8,500 yuan first. Please check and receive. (For disaster relief news, please refer to page 4 of this newspaper.)</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Buddhist Infant Protection Institute</h3>
<p>The Buddhist Infant Protection Institute was established on Buddha's Birthday this year, advocated by Mr. Sheng You'an. Mr. Sheng is a nephew of Sheng Xuanhuai and is enthusiastic about public welfare. He once founded a large-scale Yi Yuan in his hometown, and local public welfare organizations mostly relied on his strength to lay a solid foundation. This reporter recently visited the institute at 461 Avenue Albert. This is a shikumen house. Although not spacious, it is very neatly arranged. In the small courtyard, pots of magnolia flowers are arranged. A Miss clerk came out and greeted me kindly. In the middle of the guest hall, there is a painting of the birth of Sakyamuni jointly painted by Wu Hufan's brothers, with a couplet written by Ye Gongchuo hanging on both sides. The calligraphy and painting are both excellent.</p>
<p>The office and medical room are in the side room downstairs. The medical and health facilities are quite complete. Dr. Yin, the director of medical affairs, is injecting serum into a child and is working very hard. The two rear rooms are the isolation room and the admission room. When a child is first admitted, he should stay in the admission room for a week. If there is no infectious disease, he can be moved to the nursery.</p>
<p>The nursery is two large rooms upstairs. The beds and bedding are arranged so neatly and orderly. Two or three of the smallest children are in a sweet dream, and several older ones are playing in another room. Seeing the guest, they all innocently shouted "Uncle" "Uncle." These children, who were still struggling with death on the streets two or three weeks ago, are now so happy and energetic. They are saved, saved in great love.</p>
<p>Following the visit to the bathroom and dining room, the layout and equipment show the painstaking management of the hosts everywhere. The children's diet here is scientifically managed according to nutritional standards. Some children gained one or two pounds in weight in the first week of arrival. The health and life of the children are recorded every day.</p>
<p>Although it was a hasty visit, the impression left in my mind is indelible. In such difficult circumstances, what is more beautiful and precious than the smiles of the children? On the way back, I thought of the couplet next to the Buddha statue, "Nourish the spiritual roots with the rain of Dharma, nurture the seeds of goodness to irrigate the Ganges of sands" - these two sentences should be the best praise for Chairman Sheng and all the gentlemen engaged in the work!</p>
