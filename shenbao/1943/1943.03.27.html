<h3 id="c1">世界兩大陣營的對照 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>目前世界戰爭的兩大陣營，表示出極强烈的對照：一方面是軸心國的國際關係之單純與率直，另一方面是反軸心國之間關係之複雜和矛盾。就以最近這幾天的時事來說，在軸心國方面，爲了更緊密協力的春季作戰，在歐洲有德義在羅馬的會議，在亞洲有東京的日德義會議，而東條首相的答訪我國，緬甸行政長官的訪日，彼此披誠相見，一切間題，都有一致的動向。因此軸心國的動作，常常制敵於機先，而站在主動的地位。</p>
<p>可是，反軸心國的情形全然不是如此，過去的不必說，就以最近的事來說，被稱爲「大規模軍事行動之前奏」的卡薩勃朗加會議，自然沒有重慶政權代表挿足之餘地，而蘇聯也沒有代表參加，所謂「同盟國會議」，不過如此。這一會議所侈言的「攻勢」，至今毫無影響。相反的，反軸心國之間彼此的矛盾，却日益表面化，不只是英美和蘇聯之間的對立無法解消，因而發生了美蘇間史丹萊失言事件，和英蘇間波土問題的齟齬。而且在英美之間，也有着不可解消的矛盾（參閱今日本報特譯稿），末路窮途的火國，對美不能不存防範之心，而貪得無厭的美國統治者，却隨時在打算如何呑沒大不列顚帝國的遺產。而對於法國問題的爭執，更演爲貽笑一世的「季（勞特）特（戈爾）之爭」的醜史。艾登外相之訪美，自然含有調解英美蘇紛爭，而强化三國團結的意義，其中尤以對蘇問題爲中心。但是更切實的說，還不過是爲了調整英美變方的關係而已。什麼蘇聯所盼望的「第二戰綫」，以及重慶政權所囈求的「牧復緬甸」，澳洲所夢想的太平洋反攻，其實都是遠離事實的紙上空談而已。本月二十二日邱吉爾廣播，正是對重慶和澳洲當頭一盆冷水。</p>
<p>反軸心諸國的矛盾，固然無法解決，然而我們還應該知道，敵人英美還是當世最大的帝國主義國家，他們還保有相當龐大的用弱小國家和殖民地血汗結成的工業力和戰鬬力，不僅他們的總崩潰的日子還不就在目前，而且還可能作他們垂死的掙扎。軸心國如德義與日本的聯系與協力，多少還受到空間——地理上的限制，因此無論就世界新秩序的意義，或是保護東亞的意義上說，東亞軸心諸國之加强團結，首先是中日兩國的更密切的合作，是東亞民族當前第一重大的任務。歐洲大憲章也許就要公布，以更明確的說明這次軸心作戰的目標，而亞洲大憲章，雖然還沒有明文規定，可是，最近東條首招之訪華，和前日關於中日關係與允許緬甸獨立的聲明，正可說是無形的大憲章的實踐。勝利永遠是站在坦白合作的一方面的，在英美欺壓政策下的東方諸民族，應該是最後醒覺的時候了。</p>

<p>渝「中央警官學校」敎育長李士珍，曾赴東南各省視察警務，及耒陽東南警官訓練班，據談：「自去年十月間由渝出發，經黔，桂，轉赴湘。粤，贛，浙，閩各省之重要城市視察一般警務，爲時二月，已視察之地域爲黔，湘，粤，贛，浙，閩等六省，此次視察所得各地警察人員尙能刻古，奮發從事，惟多有未盡警察任務，而爲分外之事所牽連者，今後亟應改正。各省當局對辦理警政甚爲重視，但目前各地所辦之警察離開理想尙遠。其中原因甚多，重要者爲社會人士對警察之認識未够，規定警察名爲「警士」，而一般人皆呼之爲「警兵」，無形中將其地位降低，其决爲新餉之低微，甚有連兩餐未得飽者，其工作情緒當不能振奮，他如警察本身尙存在若干缺點，亦爲吾人所不能否認者。如素質之參差不齊，工作態度不良，及過去警祭之定義，「限制人民之自由」一點，以致人民與警察，變成對立現象，此實爲一大錯誤。現已加以改正，警察必須保障人民之自山，淮而愛護人民。至各省之警務，個別論之，辦理較優者，如閩之福州，湘之長沙，衡山等處所辦戶籍，成績較好；贛之贛縣，市容齊整秩序良好；粤省警訓工作較優；湘，粤警察精神，亦令人滿意。其他各地亦在逐漸進步中」。（三十二年二月六日寄）</p>

<h3 id="c15">艾登訪美無功 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>（沮利希田口特派員十九日發）英外相艾登在美會談的內容，羅斯福上决與記者團會見時，保守緘默，據政府公報及通信社所發出的情報，僅係「戰時及戰後反軸心國家間的政治問題」而已。綜合英美消息靈通人士的見解，艾登訪問的主要目的似爲蘇聯問題。蘇聯與英美間的關係極爲微妙，因紅軍在東部戰綫之一部份的成功，英美蘇之間引起了敵意的狀態。</p>
<h3 id="c16">英美蘇依然對立　第二戰線問題僵持不決 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>第二戰綫問題</p>
<p>釀成蘇聯與英美間敵意的主要原因，大概如次：</p>
<p>（一）關於北非傀儡政權問題，蘇聯對於英美的擁立達朗表示不滿。</p>
<p>（二）在加薩勃朗加會談中，沒有蘇聯的代表出席。</p>
<p>（三）關於芬蘭單獨對蘇和平說，蘇聯完全忽視英美的宣傳。</p>
<p>（四）邱吉爾對共產主義的侵入歐洲，嚴予防範，故訪問土耳其而舉行安達那會談。</p>
<p>（五）受英國支持的南斯拉夫叛將米哈洛維基，蘇聯以爲係與義國共同策動者。故提出抗議。</p>
<p>（六）關於蘇聯對舊波蘭領土問題，英美表示同情於波蘭。</p>
<p>（七）蘇聯重又宣傳汎斯拉夫主義，暗示對巴爾幹的野心。</p>
<p>（八）蘇聯漠視大西洋憲章，宣稱將覇持戰後波羅的海諸國的宗主權。</p>
<p>（九）美國駐蘇大使史丹萊的反蘇言論。</p>
<p>（十）美國副總統華萊斯宣稱：「英美蘇若不能成立諒解，則第三次世界大戰無從避免。但在這諒解成立之前，蘇聯必須首先放棄引起世界革命的特、洛茨基主義，同意將歐洲置於英美的基督敎的民主主義之下。」</p>
<p>（十一）所有這些問顧，結果重又歸結於第二戰綫問題。蘇聯要求開闢第二戰綫的呼聲，復見熾烈，而英美則始終遲疑徘徊。</p>
<p>此外，英美蘇問政治提携不能圓滿的另一原因，在於英美二國間對蘇態度的不一致。主要象微即係羅邱對達朗問題見解的不同。起用法國的穩健份子以重建法國，羅邱在此點上意見完全一致，但邱吉爾在支持達朗的政策上，對蘇聯表示退讓，畏懼英國輿論及特戈爾派的反對，不得不保持極端的沉默。然羅斯福則對蘇聯的感情毫不介意，公然聲稱支持達朗。逕自進行獨自的歐洲政策，美國國務院的有力人士，蘇聯的反對者，增多起來，鑒於美國軍需生產的現狀，不復如英國般須仰蘇聯的鼻息，儘可以我行我是，無所顧忌。</p>
<p>但英國對這美蘇間的空氣深抱危懼，三國之間的提拂若不緊密，則將成爲他日蘇聯席捲歐洲的誘因。即就目前看來，假使同盟國的蘇聯脫離反軸心陣綫，則直接使英國孤立於歐洲大陸之外，在軍事上陷於危殆的境地，故總得設法把目前的事熊加以改善。</p>
<p>關於此點，新聞紀事報曾稱「此次華盛頓會談的主要目的，不能不覓求英美兩國政府對蘇態度的一致」，此言大可注目。</p>
<p>綜合所有的情報，艾登與美當局及其他方面的會談，內容不僅是蘇聯與英美間的問題，而是想使英美的政治合作更趨密切，一部份的報紙並希望英美政治委員的實現。據本地報紙的華盛頓電訊，此次的會談，法國問題自亦在討論之列。英美對法問題所抱的一般概念，可以「若沒有强盛的法國，則歐洲和平的完成極爲因難」一言盡之。</p>
<p>目前突尼西亞的軍事情勞，愈趨尖銳化，英美正焦慮在今夏之前是否能確保突尼西亞全土。法國的政治問題，漸漸出現於反軸心陣營的前面，中立國軍事專門家今尙確信反軸心軍若能占領突尼西亞，則可爲從側面侵入歐洲南部的前提。關於此點，蒙高茂萊的英國第八軍最近開始攻擊馬萊斯要塞綫的羅美爾軍左翼，引起深切的注視。</p>
<p>艾登與赫爾的聲明</p>
<p>艾登的訪美，視爲與第二戰綫有關的看法，有下列二種。其一，目前美蘇閒所醞釀的政治的氣氛，阻害了加薩勃朗加會談後英首相邱吉爾所發表的在「以後九個月間」即將實行的反軸心國軍事計劃。這是艾登訪美後立即擬訂的反軸心軍在何處開闢第二戰綫計劃的基礎德。國宣傳部長戈培爾最近發出警吿謂：反軸心軍的侵入作戰必將遇到反攻而遭受挫折，德國對於英美的侵入企圖，常嚴陣以待，所以現在歐洲的軍事情勢，極爲緊急而重要。這緊迫的情勢，由於紅軍攻勢的衰退，德軍巧妙地脫出了冬季的重大危機，一至四月，蘇聯的南部戰綫將因冰雪融解而使大規模戰事無法進行，因此而愈增其緊迫的感覺。蘇聯利用此情勢，常發出早日開闢第二戰綫的要求。</p>
<p>而據另一看法，英國在目前情勢下並不想立即開闢第二戰綫，艾登的訪美，首先在於確立英美的再建歐洲案，以此爲基礎，希望與蘇聯能成立更深的諒解。假使成功，則即將設置英美蘇的政治委員會，這反軸心國的政治攻勢，以組織對共產主義的歐洲十字軍爲號召，故視爲係對抗軸心方面的方針之必要舉措。美國務卿赫爾與艾登會談後發表的聲明，稱「歐洲戰爭，較一般人所推測的，或許將遠爲悠久。」中立國方面把上述聲明解釋爲第二戰綫問題遭遇極度困難的表示。但由此即結論說英美放棄在本年度中開闢第二戰綫的企岡，顯屬過早。</p>
<p>赫爾聲明的內容，可在艾登訪美的使命中有關政治的性質之點上加以檢討，與其軍事的性質並無關聯。</p>
<p>泰晤士報的說明</p>
<p>艾登的訪美，以「打倒共產主義十字軍」爲號召，對軸心方面的宣傳活動有反作用。軸心方面的宣傳活動，對於逐行戰爭的全般活動上，於政治方面給與相當重大的影饗。因此，此次的華盛頓會談中，討論猶太人問題決非偶然。但英國報紙對艾登的訪美並無過甚的奢望，總括的說，艾登爲了使美國的歐洲政策受到英國的影響而赴華盛頓，泰晤士報用別一形式加以說明：「艾登的目的，與美國人共同討論英國的世界政策及殖民政策，並討論英國作爲世界帝國在戰後的地位」。所用的言詞極爲暗昧，泰晤士報的這評論，暗示出艾登所負使命的方向。（翔：譯自三月二十一日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<h3 id="c26">關於文化用紙問題 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— 陶亢德</p>
<p>讀了廿六日申報社評「嚴重的文化用紙問題」，不覺吐了一口氣，文化用紙問題在一般人雖不甚覺其嚴重，但在眞個從事於出版文化者，則感於如紙之問題「不早解決，則不僅各大書局難求其恢復出版圖書，即目前各報　雜誌，亦有在不久將來，無法繼續出版之危機，瞻念文化前途，實有令人不寒而慄者」。（社評中語）但問題雖然如此之嚴重，提出此問題大聲疾呼籲請當局及文化界協力解決之奢，我僅於申報此一社評見之，故日讀後不覺吐了一口氣。</p>
<p>文化用紙問題之嚴重，其實不始於今日。當數年前十敎授發表中國本位文化宣言時，記者曾戲與友人說過：「假如西洋人見了這宣言吃起醋來，停止出售報紙與我，中國本位的文化也就難言了！」蓋「紙張是保存文化和溝通知識的工具，」而我國「印刷上用紙，大部來自外國」（亦爲申報社評中語）。我國日常重要用品之仰給於外國者，巳到了「無機不至」的地步，如米麥如花紗，如木材，如報紙皆非舶來不可，換言之，凡我國人之衣食住行以至保存文化溝通知識的重要物資，均須求諸於外，國防所須之飛機大砲，更無論矣：這樣一個物物須求諸人的國家，無論爲和爲戰，瞻念前途，怎不叫人不寒而慄？</p>
<p>言歸正傳，申報社評迫切希望當局及文化界協力解決文化用紙問題之點，爲第一，大量增產文化用紙。第二，對於各紙商凡在前年十二月八日以前購進之外國報紙，立即重行登記，施行限價。對於本地產紙各廠，則估計其成本，施行限價，同時嚴禁非紙商囤積居奇。第三立即實打管制消費，合理分配。然後對於報紙雜誌圖書出版界實行合理分配，給與獲得用紙的充分保障。凡此三者，在記者看來其實都是言之匪艱，行之亦不難的小事，紙要當局有決心做去，無一不是一舉手之勞的易事，我在道裏除渴望實施之外，且來補充一點紙價暴漲及其影　於出版文化的事實，以明文化用紙問題之如何嚴重，藉證「瞻念文化前途實有令人不寒而慄」云云之決非危言聳聽。</p>
<p>在「七七事變」當時，外國報紙價錢每令不及六元，到一九三九年歐戰爆發，也不過十七八元，甚至十二八太平洋戰爭發生，外紙來源完全杜絕，也還不出百元，此後時時增漲，在去年年底尚在三百元以內。及至一過新年，就像人之長了一歲一樣，一漲就漲了百餘元，接着是無日不漲，有夜皆增，近一月來曾自五百元漲至千元左右。這樣的漲法，記者無以名之，只好名之曰「混漲」，如此混漲下去，到今年年底，大槪不會不賣到一萬元一令。倘報紙非保存文化和溝通知識的工具，就是漲到十萬元一令也且由牠，倘報紙成本亦在繼漲增高，售價之昂也還情有可原，無如紙是文化的生命線，即云無紙即無文化亦非過言，而無文化的國家試問父算什麼國家？再則誠如申報社評所云，上海所有外國報紙均爲十二月八日以前積存之貨，其進價決不至高出百元以上。以少數人之暴利，而陷出版事業於停滯，又豈社會公意與國家法令所許？</p>
<p>紙價暴漲的結果，當然使有志於出版文化者困於力不從心，望紙興歎。記者個人於年初籌備一個自以爲有出版價値的譯文月刋，集稿付排，爲時不過兩月，而紙價之日漲夜增，已使原來計劃整個打破，今雖勉强付印，恐亦難免夭折，蓋在計劃之初，紙價不到三百，今則已將近千，若刊物售價隨紙價之漲而增，讀者殊難負担，允可畏者是紙價之漲，漫無止境，使人無法計算成本。欲不自討苦吃，弄得焦頭爛額，只有打打麻將出版管牠娘之一法！這雖是我個人自知的甘苦，恐亦爲有心而無力的出版文化經營者之共同遭遇。</p>
<p>記者常與多數友人談過，今日國事百孔千瘡，誠足使醫國者焦心竭慮，吃力而不容易討好，但在滿目瘡痍之中，出版文化之停滯病總不失爲一重症，而此重症也者，醫療起來比之政治經濟容易奏功得多，只要眞有仁心，即無仁衛亦不難藥到病除。我於今日醫國者之實際表現，竊欲於肯否解決文化用紙一小問題中覘之。</p>

<p>近來調整强化戰時經濟機構的聲調，可說是高唱入雲。所可喜的，是調整强化均已次第實現。繼全國商業統制總會的設置，復有工商同業公會條例的頒佈。這兩件事的相生相應，在調整强化戰時經濟機構方面說，確爲最合理的步驟。</p>
<p>關於强化同業公會一個話題，本欄前已迭爲反覆陳詞的論列。茲於硏究國府命令公佈的工商同業公會條例全文，深覺其中主要各條，恰合三月二十三日本欄評言中所列舉的三個原則；例如，條例中第二條。「工商同業公會以協助政府施行經濟政策及增進同業之公共利益爲宗旨，」第十三條：「主管官署得命令經營主要商品之公司行號，加入各該業同業公會；經營主要商品之公司行號，非經加人同業公會，不得營業，」及第十八條：「工商同業公會之職員，有違背法令會章或其他重大情節者，得由公會議決令其退職，主要商品之同業公會職員，地方主管官署認爲不稱職時，得命令其退職，」均與日前本攔　議三點，茶合符節。</p>
<p>以上所列舉的三條，實爲工商同業公會條例全文中的軸心，因爲我們早經說過，今後同業公會的責任是：（一）推行經濟政策。——一方通力合作，以謀本業的福利，同時還須協助政府推行經濟政策，（二）集中同業力量——加緊集團組織；凡屬同業，務必加入公會，（三）約束部下操守——凡仟同業公會職務，必須絕對公正廉潔。工商同業公會條例的公佈，旣爲調整戰時經濟機構重要程序中的又一慕，所以不憚煩凟，重申此義，冀以道三個基本原則獻給同業公會，作爲它們永久的座右銘。</p>
<h3 id="c36">工商同業公會條例公布後　本市各業公會均將調整 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　國府當局爲實施戰時經濟政策，業已訂頒綱領，對於抑平物價安定民生，決從改進輕濟機構，强化物資統制，安定金融，增加生產等諸要點積極進行，同時爲達到合理的統制起見，特頒布全國商業統制總會及戰時物資移動取締等兩條例，將整個統制工作，在日本常局協力之下，交由實業部當局責由商業團體自主辦理，茲者全國商業統制總會業於本月十五日正式成立，開始辦理物資移動申請許可事宜，及辦理各業物資存貨登記，現悉國府以統制工作已初步實現，對於經濟機構之調整亟待進行，故於日昨制定工商同業公會暫以條例公布施行，凡各省市工商同業公會，均須依遵條例之規定，在中央中管官署指導監督之下，調整組織之，以期協助政府施行經濟政策及增進同業之公共利益，俾可餘圖推進復興工商經濟之目的，茲據中央社記者向本市各關係方面探悉各情分誌如下：</p>
<p>物資移動申請踴躍</p>
<p>全國商業統制總會自經成立後，即迭經理監事召集臨時聯席會議，商討內部組織系統，及物資統制問題，現內部組織系統及人事選拔大致決定，對於物資統制及移動規定與手續亦已商決呈部備案，物資移動許可事務所收到各業物資移動申請書簽發之許可證達二百餘件，連日各業物資存貨數量向該會登記者極爲踴躍，聞該會並於第三决理監事聯席會議時通過各業聯合會通則，呈部核示，將來對於各業同業公會性質相同者決予合併組成聯合會，以便處理各業物資收購運銷配合及評價等一切統制事宜。</p>
<p>積極調整經濟機構</p>
<p>實業部當局爲便利推行統制政策，强化戰時經濟機構起見，特擬訂工商同業公會暫行條例，呈准國府頒布施行，廢止舊有工商同業公會法，對於舊有各種經濟機構之不適合戰時經濟體制之工商團體，一律予以調整，在中央主管官署指導監督之下，重行改組，據中央社記者向市經濟局探悉，本市各業同業公會均須依遵政府公布之工商同業公會暫行條例，規定重行調整，一俟工商同業公會暫行條例施行細則明令公布後，即積極進行督飭改組機構，其以前各業同業公會組織原爲委員制，今後則改爲理事制，對於各業同業公會性質相同者，或有合併組織聯合會之必要，亦將由政府明令規定之。</p>

<p>— 兼之</p>
<p>自法幣政策實行以後，形勢突變，中·中·交·農四行利用獨有之發行擭，可以創造貨幣賢金，間接操縱金融，漸成爲銀行之銀行，商業銀行從前之重要性，乃逐漸喪失。且中交二行，仍兼營商業銀行之一般業務，挾其雄厚之資力，固有之特權，積極經營，其存戲增加之速，非其他銀行所能望其項背，商業銀行之勢力，漸入衰落之時代。</p>
<p>中日事變以後，中·中·交·農四行在華中之勢力，雖遂漸减退；但商業銀行並未能取而代之，繼之者，先爲滙豐銀行，現則爲中央儲備銀行。商業銀行本身之資力，反因戰時貨幣不定之影響，大有江柯日下，無復當年之感，其百業領袖之頭銜，實亦名存而實亡矣！</p>
<p>夫在經濟界勢力之造成，在資力之龐大與運用之黨活。過去商業銀行之地位，卽利用其資力而造成。今則商業銀行依賴爲資力命脈之存款，雖表面略有增加，但實質上已遠不如前。查上海十一家銀行上海存款二十五年爲四萬萬九千一百萬元，至三十年爲十萬零一千一百萬元，的增一倍有餘，至三十一年，以儲備券之推行，如不計兩對一之折合，則幾恢復事變前之數字，故存款之增加，事實上至爲有限。現在最大商業銀行在上海之存款，亦不過一萬萬元左右，而上海企業價値在萬萬元以上者，累累皆是，銀行雖欲操縱，安可能乎？倘依貨幣購買力以度量商業銀行之資力，觀表內之指數，僅爲事變前三十三分之一，其資力之銳减，可謂慘矣！</p>

<h3 id="c42">「正經」與「隨便」 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— 皈眞</p>
<p>胡適之有過一篇『差不多』先生傳，諷刺一般中國人做事凡是『差不多』就可以了，不必去求其精確和密緻。但是究竟『差不多』已經正經地下了一些工夫，事情成就得有些差不多了。</p>
<p>根本對事情的要做與不要做，和分別一些做後的好壞，懶于費神而定取捨的人，也佔了不在少數。只要不是十分渴的時候想不到重要地掘一個泉源；事情小是像火燒眉毛，連迷信的『抱佛脚』的虔誠也不會考慮過；總是懶得一想而馬馬虎虎的。</p>
<p>『隨便好了，何必太正經呢。』</p>
<p>隨便吐痰是不合於衛生的，何書不是朦朦朧朧地每人知道着的，但是當膩膩的痰停在咽頭時：『何必太正經呢隨便好了。』這一口東西又隨便地吐了出來。</p>
<p>明知賭博和女色是旣勞神又傷財的，但是「逢塲作嬉哪，何必正經」又是隨便了一陣子。</p>
<p>很多鴉片的嗜好者恐怕大都是隨隨便便地『呼一筒』上了經的罷，據說這些正是恬靜與散淡的詩趣呢。即使已經遭受到這嗜好之害的人們，還是懶得去糾正，於是任何社會的革新運動都提倡不起來了。</p>
<p>這些一部份中國人所特有的脾氣，正是馬馬虎虎造成至今民心薄弱而减少振奮力量的毒素。而這「隨便」的毒素歸根結蒂，幾乎還是一個「懶』字。</p>
<p>且慢把一切運動的調子高唱入雲去，在隨隨便便的人看來還是耳邊風一樣。要讓更困苦的現實把這個懶得用腦子的人驚醒過來，自覺地鏟去這個『懶』字，於是一切可隨之就範，向一條新生活的軌道上去了。</p>
<h3 id="c43">需要這兩種人 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— 邱肇彬</p>
<p>袁世凱秉政時候；他見政府中人才濟濟，內中充塞着皇親國戚，他就說人浮於事，後來凡遇到了一椿困難事情，極需要一個很好的人才去辦理，可是一個也沒有，他又說：事浮於人。</p>
<p>在目前環境中，雖然人浮於事，但是眞正的人才極少，應需要下面兩種人才：</p>
<p>創造的人有一種人，智力比較高，體力比較强，而又懷有一種願望，想要替人世間造出一種福利，或彌補一種缺憾；於是把所有的體力智力用以創造其所欲創造的事物。不論是技工也罷，藝術也罷，哲理也罷，文學也罷，不惜焚膏繼晷，兀兀窮年，絞其腦汁，空乏其身，或竟冒大險，犯大難，不顧生命，一心只在創造成功上打算，在世界各民族中間，都有其人：不過比較少些最了。</p>
<p>適應的人　有一種人，雖未具創造的智慧願望，可是他對於自己謀生的學識技能，竭力硏習；並對於自己任務範圍以內的工作，竭力改進，積豐富的經騐，到一處適應一處；無論自己應做的事，或旁人囑辦的事，都用全力去幹，幹到圓滿成功爲止，社會上對於這種人相需甚殷，但實際上恐求過於供哩。（却酬）</p>
<h3 id="c44">眞愛 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— 謝淑</p>
<p>許多人都錯覺地以爲「愛」便是討好於所愛的對象，同時也要別人放任着自己，這是曲解了愛的眞諦，與其說是愛，無寗說是私心的顯現。</p>
<p>在人類愛的表現中，雖然含有各種不同的質素，雖然有其不同的對象，但是眞愛的出發點是共同的，無論是母愛友愛戀愛，同樣的，眞純的情操是無私的，爲善的，是自勉勉人使人精神上進的，同時見到所愛的人有行爲不檢之處，便是自己極大的痛苦而決不加以姑息的。</p>
<p>唯其如此，所以也祇有眞能自愛的人，然後才能愛人，並且誠摯的愛是理性的，中和而不過份地熱情，然而能給被愛者一種優美的意志，反之，凡是不自愛，不追求眞的美與善的人便決不會賞識別人的高潔。</p>
<p>人生是需要愛的滋潤和培植的，愛是產生一切力量的泉源，也是生活的意義，然而我們要醇化自己的愛，我們也不要別人濫施重的情感。</p>

<p>— 辛波</p>
<p>『阿五哥！阿五哥！你也來上靈山麼！』一個呼聲，從他的右面傳過來。他立刻將他的遐想收起，抬頭再放出眼光去，找尋那個呌他的人。奇怪，他竟看不淸那個呌他的是誰，原來他和那人之間，正隔着桑樹田的一角，那人切近着桑枝，他則離開得遠些，桑枝淆亂了他的視綫。他不答，只將頭左右擺着，要認淸那個叫着走過來的人。</p>
<p>『阿五哥，阿五哥！』那人笑嘻嘻地轉過來了，肩頭上挑着兩隻空糞桶。</p>
<p>『呀，原來是大根哥！』阿五看淸楚了，喜得直跳起來。「想不到在這裏會碰到你！你怎麼不去上靈山，却在這　挑糞？——糞天天好挑，何必定要今天挑？——挑糞澆什麼？——……」</p>
<p>一連串的話，也就是一述申的詢問，不待大根回答，只是說下去。等到他好像汨汨的瓶水，將近自然地流完時，大根才揀了幾句話回答他。</p>
<p>『靈山就在我們的後門口，不上也罷。——挑糞澆桑樹。木來桑樹已爆出葉來，不　澆，但是天下雨，坑裏滿得溢出來，也只好挑兩担來澆澆。——你一個人來的麼？』回答完了，免不了也有所詢問。『怎麼走得出來的呢？』</p>
<p>『他媽的！』大根這樣一問，好像引起了阿五的牢騷，劈口就沒頭沒腦地駡了一聲，『老子又不是賣給他家的！一天到晚，做這樣做那樣，忙得不亦樂乎，還討不到好，碰碰吃說話！今天早上，那位小魔君，又要吃這樣吃那樣，叫我去買，遲了一些，大發脾氣，駡了不算，還拿棒來打。打雖不見得痛，老子心裏一氣，吃了飯，碗一放，筷一丟，就此走了出來，管他媽的，大不了敲破一隻鱉脚飯碗！…………』</p>
<p>「唷唷唷，我倒不知道你有這許多氣。」大根一味笑着。『不要氣，且到我家去坐坐，喝口茶，然後再上山去。去年我爹多承你照顧，我們都能感激。』</p>
<p>「不要客氣，我要緊到山上去散散心，不到你家去了。倒是你，不要挑糞吧，陪我到山上去走走吧，難得的。』（二十一）</p>

<h3 id="e1">World Comparison of Two Major Camps <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The current two major camps in the world war display a very strong contrast: on one hand, the Axis powers have a simple and straightforward international relationship, while on the other hand, the anti-Axis countries have complex and contradictory relationships. Taking the events of the past few days as an example, on the Axis side, in order to cooperate more closely in the spring campaign, there were German-Italian meetings in Rome and Japanese-German-Italian meetings in Tokyo. Furthermore, Prime Minister Tojo reciprocated by visiting our country, and the administrative head of Burma visited Japan. They met each other with sincerity, and all issues had a consistent direction. Therefore, the actions of the Axis powers often preempted the enemy and took the initiative.</p>
<p>However, the situation for the anti-Axis countries is completely different. Not to mention the past, even recent events, such as the Casablanca Conference, which was called a "prelude to large-scale military operations," naturally had no room for representatives from the Chongqing regime to participate, and the Soviet Union also did not have representatives participating. This so-called "Allied Conference" was merely that. The "offensive" talked about at this conference has had no impact to this day. On the contrary, the contradictions between the anti-Axis countries have become increasingly apparent. Not only is the conflict between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union unable to be resolved, leading to the Stanley faux pas between the United States and the Soviet Union and the dispute between Britain and the Soviet Union over the Polish issue, but there are also irreconcilable contradictions between Britain and the United States (see today's special translation in this newspaper). France, at the end of its rope, cannot help but be wary of the United States, while the insatiably greedy American rulers are constantly planning how to swallow the legacy of the British Empire. And the dispute over the French issue has even evolved into the scandalous "季 (Loutre)-特 (Gore) dispute" that will be a laughingstock for generations to come. Foreign Secretary Eden's visit to the United States naturally carries the meaning of mediating disputes among Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union and strengthening the unity of the three countries, especially focusing on the Soviet issue. But more realistically, it is merely to adjust the relationship between Britain and the United States. The "second front" hoped for by the Soviet Union, the "recovery of Burma" sought by the Chongqing regime, and the Pacific counteroffensive dreamed of by Australia are all empty talk on paper far from reality. Churchill's broadcast on the 22nd of this month poured cold water on both Chongqing and Australia.</p>
<p>While the contradictions among the anti-Axis countries are indeed unsolvable, we should also be aware that the enemy, Britain and the United States, are still the largest imperialist countries in the world. They still possess considerable industrial and combat power built from the blood and sweat of weak countries and colonies. Not only is their total collapse not imminent, but they may also make a last-ditch struggle. The connection and cooperation between the Axis powers, such as Germany, Italy, and Japan, are still limited by space—geography. Therefore, whether in terms of the meaning of the new world order or the meaning of protecting East Asia, strengthening the unity of the East Asian Axis powers, first and foremost, the closer cooperation between China and Japan, is the most important task facing the East Asian nations today. The European Great Charter may be announced soon to more clearly explain the goals of this Axis operation, while the Asian Great Charter, although not yet explicitly stipulated, is being practiced through Prime Minister Tojo's recent visit to China and the statement regarding Sino-Japanese relations and allowing Burma's independence. Victory always stands on the side of candid cooperation. The Eastern nations under the oppressive policies of Britain and the United States should finally awaken.</p>
<h3 id="e2">### Finance Minister Zhou Talks About the Exchange Rate Between Central Reserve Bank Notes and United Reserve Bank Notes: 100 Yuan to 18 Yuan, Special Round Exchange Rate and Shanghai Exchange Rate Unchanged <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese authorities announced that they would stop issuing new military notes from April 1st, the connection between the Central Reserve Bank notes and the Japanese yen will be firmly maintained at an exchange rate of 100 yuan to 18 yen. However, regarding the ratio between Central Reserve Bank notes and United Reserve Bank notes, there are still no clear regulations, so the market situation is volatile. The North China Financial Administration, under the supervision of Shi Jing, yesterday issued a statement explaining the relationship rate between Central Reserve Bank notes and United Reserve Bank notes. A Central News Agency reporter believes that it is still necessary for the general public to further understand this matter, and therefore visited Finance Minister Zhou, who agreed to issue the following statement: "The authorities of friendly nations recently announced that after April 1st, the issuance of new military notes will be abolished. I have also issued a statement on this point. However, after the abolition of the issuance of new military notes, the relationship between Central Reserve Bank notes and United Reserve Bank notes is a matter of great concern to the general public, and therefore there is much speculation and conjecture. Regarding this point, it is necessary to provide a brief explanation. The clearing methods between North China and Central China originally included three types: military note exchange, special round exchange, and Shanghai exchange. The so-called military note exchange is the exchange of military notes and United Reserve Bank notes at par value for transactions of specific materials and remittances to and from friendly nation nationals. The so-called special round exchange is the exchange settled in Japanese yen under the personal connection system, with North China export locations as the premise. The so-called Shanghai exchange is the direct clearing of Central Reserve Bank notes and United Reserve Bank notes. Because the issuance of new military notes has been abolished, military note exchange will naturally be transformed into direct exchange of Central Reserve Bank notes for United Reserve Bank notes. Since the market price of military note exchange is the same as the par value of military notes and United Reserve Bank notes, the exchange rate of Central Reserve Bank notes to United Reserve Bank notes will naturally become 100 yuan to 18 yuan within the scope of the original military note exchange, which is now transformed into Central Reserve Bank note exchange. However, this is only limited to those within this scope. What Supervisor Shi Jing declared the other day only refers to this. As for special round exchange and Shanghai exchange, they have no other relationship with this abolition of the issuance of new military notes, and therefore there is no change whatsoever. As mentioned above, due to the abolition of the issuance of new military notes, the clearing method between North China and Central China is merely being corrected according to natural trends, only in terms of what should naturally be changed, and there is no substantial change to the previous practice."</p>

First, the students sang the spirit song. Then, the Chairman gave instructions to the students, with sincere words expressed in his speech, which lasted for an hour. The students were deeply moved.

<h3 id="e4">### Japanese Garrison in China Announces Weekly War Situation <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Garrison in China announced the following weekly war situation on March 26th: The Japanese army's spring offensive operations in the Subei area and Hubei Province have ended with great results. The characteristic of this operation is the sharp increase in the number of returnees and prisoners, totaling 51,000 people. Since the National Government's participation in the war, the total has exceeded 130,000 people. In addition, Japanese aircraft have been relentlessly bombing military strongholds in the Chongqing area and transport ships on the Yangtze River for days. At that time, neither the US Air Force nor the Chongqing Air Force fought back, which proves the incompetence of the US Air Force and does not require further criticism from the Japanese side. The Chongqing Ta Kung Pao commented on this, saying that if this situation continues, transport aircraft will be of no use. Recalling the past when the Chongqing side controlled the American volunteer forces, it is felt that the present is not as good as the past.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Garrison in China announced the following regarding the change of name of the special service organ on March 26th: "The relationship between China and Japan is becoming increasingly close, and at the same time, the political power of the National Government has been increasingly strengthened, which is deeply gratifying. The Japanese Garrison in China, this time, in order to cooperate from the side with the active development of the work of the various organs of the National Government, has decided to adjust the organizational structure of the old military special service organ and redevelop it under a new character to adapt to the new situation. The main points are as follows: (1) The name of the special service organ will be changed to Liaison Department; (2) It will specialize in investigation and liaison matters related to operations and security; (3) The original county liaison officers will be abolished. The timing of its new development will be determined based on the situation in urban and remote areas. In short, it is only to seek the autonomous activities of the Chinese side, and matters directly related to the actions of the Japanese army should be carried out without any regrets. The Japanese Garrison is determined to follow the previous announcement, taking the hearts of the officers and soldiers of the dispatched army under the Greater East Asia War as its own, and strive to complete its purpose. It is hoped that the general Japanese residents in China will also take the same attitude as the officers and soldiers of the dispatched army, respond to national policies, adopt an attitude of willing self-restraint, and actively put it into practice."</p>

<p>— Zhenru</p>
<p>Li Shizhen, the Educational Director of the Chongqing "Central Police Academy," visited the southeastern provinces to inspect police affairs, and the Laiyang Southeastern Police Officers Training Class. According to him: "I departed from Chongqing around October of last year and went to the southeastern provinces via Guizhou and Guangxi. I inspected general police affairs in important cities in Hunan, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces for two months. The areas I have inspected are the six provinces of Guizhou, Hunan, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Fujian. From this inspection, I found that the police personnel in various places are still able to endure hardship and work hard, but many have not fulfilled their police duties and have been involved in extra matters, which should be corrected urgently in the future. The authorities in various provinces attach great importance to handling police affairs, but the police affairs currently handled in various places are far from ideal. There are many reasons for this, the important ones being that the public's understanding of the police is insufficient, the police are nominally called 'police officers,' but the general public calls them 'police soldiers,' which invisibly lowers their status. The decisive factor is the low salary, with some even unable to eat two full meals a day, so their work enthusiasm cannot be boosted. Other shortcomings still exist in the police themselves, which we cannot deny, such as the uneven quality, poor work attitude, and the definition of the police in the past as 'restricting the freedom of the people,' which has led to an antagonistic phenomenon between the people and the police, which is indeed a big mistake. It has now been corrected, and the police must protect the freedom of the people, and love the people. As for the police affairs in various provinces, individually speaking, those that are handled better include the household registration handled in Fuzhou, Fujian, and Changsha and Hengshan in Hunan, which have achieved better results; the city appearance of Ganxian in Jiangxi is neat and orderly; the police training work in Guangdong Province is better; and the police spirit in Hunan and Guangdong is also satisfactory. Other places are also gradually improving." (Sent on February 6, 32nd year)</p>

<h3 id="e14">German Forces Heavily Bomb Leningrad with Long-Range Artillery; Fierce Fighting in the Smolensk Region <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>German Headquarters, 26th (Haitong News Agency) - The German military report this afternoon stated that there were no particularly important battles on the Eastern Front yesterday. German aircraft heavily bombed several areas, destroying several trains carrying military supplies and sinking several ships. The offensive power of the Soviet forces south of Lake Ladoga has been sharply reduced. Our aircraft bombed the port of Grachik (on the Caucasus coast) and enemy rear railways, as well as industrial facilities in Leningrad. Our dive bombers sank one medium-sized merchant ship, and two others caught fire. Several trains carrying military supplies were destroyed.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to German front-line news, the German forces surrounding Leningrad suddenly heavily bombed the city's factory area and military facilities with long-range artillery on the 25th. All locations were hit and caught fire, suffering heavy damage. Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Allied News Agency) - According to reports from Moscow, the fighting in the Smolensk region is quite fierce. One village in the area has changed hands four times in recent days. In the area between Smolensk and Donets, there is temporarily positional warfare.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Central News Agency) - Because both the German and Soviet forces on the Eastern Front need to redeploy their troops and consolidate their defense lines, the German offensive along the broad front in the south and the Soviet offensive in the central region both subsided yesterday. There were only local contacts on the front line. According to Berlin news, the fiercest fighting is still clearly taking place in the Izium region.</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Haitong News Agency) - The Soviet army launched a large-scale offensive south of Lake Ladoga in the Leningrad region, which lasted for four days but was unsuccessful. On the fifth day, its offensive weakened, probably due to heavy damage. There is currently no fighting north or south of Lake Ilmen. The enemy's offensive in the central part of the Eastern Front is only of a local nature. The enemy's strength is extremely weak. There is no change in the Orel area, nor is there any change west of Kursk. Our army is currently conducting mopping-up operations in the upper and middle reaches of the Don River, which are progressing very smoothly.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Eden's Visit to the United States Unsuccessful <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(Special Correspondent Taguchi from Zurich, 19th) - President Roosevelt remained silent about the content of British Foreign Secretary Eden's talks in the United States when he met with the press corps. According to information issued by government gazettes and news agencies, it was only "political issues between anti-Axis countries during and after the war." Combining the views of well-informed sources in Britain and the United States, Eden's main purpose for visiting seems to be the Soviet issue. The relationship between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States is extremely delicate, and the success of the Red Army in a part of the Eastern Front has caused a state of hostility between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3 id="e16">The UK, US, and Soviet Union Remain at Odds: The Second Front Issue Remains Deadlocked <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>The Second Front Issue</p>
<p>The main reasons for the animosity between the Soviet Union and the UK/US are probably as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the issue of the puppet regime in North Africa, the Soviet Union expressed dissatisfaction with the UK/US's support for Darlan.</p>
<p>(2) No Soviet representative attended the Casablanca Conference.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding Finland's separate peace talks with the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union completely ignored the UK/US's propaganda.</p>
<p>(4) Churchill was wary of the encroachment of communism into Europe, so he visited Turkey and held the Adana Conference.</p>
<p>(5) The Soviet Union believed that Mihailović, the Yugoslav rebel supported by the UK, was conspiring with Italy, and therefore protested.</p>
<p>(6) Regarding the Soviet Union's stance on the former Polish territories, the UK/US expressed sympathy for Poland.</p>
<p>(7) The Soviet Union has revived Pan-Slavism propaganda, implying ambitions for the Balkans.</p>
<p>(8) The Soviet Union disregarded the Atlantic Charter, claiming it would retain suzerainty over the Baltic states after the war.</p>
<p>(9) Anti-Soviet remarks by US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt.</p>
<p>(10) US Vice President Wallace stated: "If the UK, US, and Soviet Union cannot reach an understanding, a third world war will be unavoidable. But before this understanding is established, the Soviet Union must first abandon Trotskyism, which incites world revolution, and agree to place Europe under the Christian democracy of the UK/US."</p>
<p>(11) All these issues ultimately come back to the Second Front issue. The Soviet Union's call for the opening of a Second Front has resurfaced with intensity, while the UK/US have remained hesitant and wavering.</p>
<p>In addition, another reason for the lack of satisfactory political cooperation between the UK, US, and Soviet Union lies in the inconsistency of the UK/US's attitudes towards the Soviet Union. A prime example is the difference in opinion between Roosevelt and Churchill on the Darlan issue. Roosevelt and Churchill were in complete agreement on the point of using stable elements in France to rebuild the country, but Churchill showed concessions to the Soviet Union in his policy of supporting Darlan, fearing opposition from British public opinion and the Gaullists, and had to maintain extreme silence. However, Roosevelt did not care about the Soviet Union's feelings at all, and openly declared his support for Darlan, independently pursuing his own European policy. Powerful figures in the US State Department, opponents of the Soviet Union, increased in number, given the current state of US military production, no longer needing to rely on the Soviet Union as much as the UK did, and could do whatever they wanted without any hesitation.</p>
<p>However, the UK is deeply fearful of this atmosphere between the US and the Soviet Union, fearing that a lack of close coordination between the three countries would become an inducement for the Soviet Union to sweep through Europe in the future. Even in the present situation, if the Soviet Union were to leave the anti-Axis front, it would directly isolate the UK from the European continent and put it in a dangerous military position. Therefore, it is necessary to find a way to improve the current situation.</p>
<p>Regarding this point, the News Chronicle stated that "The main purpose of this Washington Conference must be to seek a consensus between the UK and US governments on their attitude towards the Soviet Union," which is a statement worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Combining all the information, Eden's talks with US officials and other parties were not only about issues between the Soviet Union and the UK/US, but also aimed to make the political cooperation between the UK and the US closer, and some newspapers even hoped for the realization of a UK-US political committee. According to Washington dispatches from local newspapers, the French issue was also among the topics discussed at this conference. The general concept of the UK/US on the French issue can be summarized by the saying "The completion of European peace is extremely difficult without a strong France."</p>
<p>The military situation in Tunisia is becoming increasingly tense, and the UK/US are anxiously considering whether they can secure the entire territory of Tunisia before this summer. The French political issue is gradually appearing at the forefront of the anti-Axis camp. Neutral military experts still believe that if the anti-Axis forces can occupy Tunisia, it can serve as a prerequisite for invading southern Europe from the side. Regarding this point, the recent attack by Montgomery's British Eighth Army on the left wing of Rommel's forces on the Mareth Line has attracted deep attention.</p>
<p>Eden's and Hull's Statements</p>
<p>Eden's visit to the US is seen as related to the Second Front issue in two ways. First, the political atmosphere currently brewing between the US and the Soviet Union is hindering the anti-Axis military plan, announced by British Prime Minister Churchill after the Casablanca Conference, which was to be implemented "within the next nine months." This is the basis for the anti-Axis forces' plan to open a Second Front, which was drafted immediately after Eden's visit to the US. German Propaganda Minister Goebbels recently issued a warning that the anti-Axis forces' invasion operations will inevitably encounter counterattacks and suffer setbacks, and that Germany is always on high alert for the UK/US's invasion attempts. Therefore, the military situation in Europe is extremely urgent and important. This sense of urgency is increased by the decline of the Red Army's offensive and the German army's skillful escape from the major crisis of winter. From January to April, the Soviet Union's southern front will be unable to conduct large-scale battles due to the melting snow and ice, thus increasing the feeling of urgency. The Soviet Union is using this situation to constantly issue demands for the early opening of a Second Front.</p>
<p>According to another view, the UK does not want to open a Second Front immediately under the current circumstances. Eden's visit to the US is primarily aimed at establishing a UK-US plan for rebuilding Europe, and on this basis, hopes to establish a deeper understanding with the Soviet Union. If successful, a UK-US-Soviet political committee will be set up. This anti-Axis political offensive is being launched under the banner of organizing a European crusade against communism, and is therefore seen as a necessary measure to counter the Axis powers' policies. The statement issued by US Secretary of State Hull and Eden after their meeting stated that "The European war may be longer than generally expected." Neutral countries have interpreted the above statement as an indication of extreme difficulties encountered in the Second Front issue. However, it would be premature to conclude from this that the UK/US have given up their plan to open a Second Front this year.</p>
<p>The content of Hull's statement can be examined in terms of the political nature of Eden's mission to the US, which is unrelated to its military nature.</p>
<p>The Times' Explanation</p>
<p>Eden's visit to the US, under the banner of "Crusade to Overthrow Communism," has a counter-productive effect on the Axis powers' propaganda activities. The Axis powers' propaganda activities have a significant impact on the political aspect of the overall war effort. Therefore, it is no coincidence that the Jewish issue was discussed at this Washington Conference. However, the British newspapers do not have excessive expectations for Eden's visit to the US. In summary, Eden went to Washington to influence the US's European policy under the influence of the UK. The Times explained it in another way: "Eden's purpose is to discuss the UK's world policy and colonial policy with the Americans, and to discuss the UK's position as a world empire after the war." The wording used is extremely ambiguous, and The Times' commentary implies the direction of Eden's mission. (Translated from the March 21st Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<p>Lisbon, 26th (Allied News Agency) - Soviet Ambassador to London, Maisky, solemnly stated yesterday that the Soviet Union has devoted its full strength to seeking victory in the war and demanded that the UK and the US each bear their responsibilities. Maisky's speech at the London branch of the Cooperative Wholesale Society stated in part: "The future of the Allies is fraught with difficulties. My country and my people sincerely hope that all the Allies, especially the UK and the US, will soon use their utmost efforts to end this terrible war at the earliest possible time, because we still have a long way to go to reach the final goal. My country and my people, under the leadership of Stalin, are making the greatest efforts to defeat our common enemy. Stalin cannot be ignored in the history of our country over the past twenty-five years." Maisky concluded by saying that Germany is still a long way from collapse and is indeed a formidable enemy.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Fierce Fighting Underway Between Two Armies on the Mareth Line in North Africa <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 25th (Havas) - The British Eighth Army attacked the Mareth Line in southern Tunisia and opened a gap on the first day. However, after a counterattack by the Axis forces, the original position has been restored. According to news from both the Axis and Allied countries, fierce fighting is currently underway. The African Corps, under General Rommel, launched a large-scale counterattack at several points and was quite successful. According to news from the Allied front lines, the two sides are fighting along the Mareth front line in a no-man's land, and the artillery fire is fierce and increasing. Berlin also declared that in central Tunisia, the enemy forces are numerous and continuously attacking, but all have been repelled by the Axis forces. The Allied headquarters stated that US reconnaissance units launched an offensive on the front line in the Gafsa area, but the center of the battle is concentrated in the Maknassy area, where the two sides are fighting along the coastal Thala-Sfax railway. The US military has made some progress. In northern Tunisia, German artillery shelled El Aouiot and El Babouch, causing the war to break out again. The German army may launch another offensive in that area.</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Huitong Agency) - Military officials say that although the British army is putting all its efforts into the offensive in Tunisia, it has not yet succeeded. On Wednesday, the British and American armies launched a large-scale offensive against the Axis forces' positions in the central and southern parts of Tunisia, but were blocked by the German and Italian armies everywhere. In only one place were the Axis forces forced to abandon their outposts. To the east of the Mareth Line, there has been no large-scale battle. In central Tunisia, a large contingent of US troops launched an offensive. After several hours of fierce fighting, part of the army broke through the Axis forces' position, but was soon repelled by fresh German forces to relieve the siege of the Axis forces' position. Another unit of the German army attacked the flank of the US army, forcing them to retreat and inflicting heavy damage.</p>

<p>The rice shops in the Public Concession and the French Concession received the 31st installment of household grain sales permits yesterday. These sales permits were obtained by the Rice Industry Association from the Municipal Council's Rice and Flour Allocation Office and distributed to its 665 member rice shops. A reporter learned from the Rice Industry Association yesterday that the rice and flour allocated for the next installment of sales permits will be (1) Grade 1 white rice, (2) Grade 2 rice, (3) broken rice, and (4) flour, the quantities of which will be the same as this installment. Rice shops are allowed to pay the Municipal Council for household grain today based on the sales permits and then obtain the goods from the designated warehouse with the delivery order. Sales are allowed to begin on April 1st based on the rice purchase certificates and flour certificates. All matching quantities and prices are still pending official announcement by the authorities. As for the next installment of household grain, there will be three types of rice and one type of Grade 2 flour, but no coarse grains will be allocated. The purchase price for each shop will temporarily be paid according to the price of the 30th installment.</p>
<p>Scheduled Distribution of Nine Batches of Rice Coupons: The Municipal Council's Information Office announced that it will distribute the ninth batch of rice purchase certificates and flour certificates, as well as the second batch of sugar certificates, with joint ticket numbers 33 to 36, and the joint ticket number for sugar certificates being 23 on the 29th of this month through the allocation certificate offices in each district. The allocation quantity and validity period of sugar certificates will be announced separately. Taxpayers or their representatives can immediately take their winter housing tax receipts (with the date specified on the back) and the spring housing tax receipts for this year, as well as the winter housing tax receipts for last year, to the allocation offices in their respective districts to collect them.</p>
<p>Grain Bureau Formulates Regulations for Sugar</p>
<p>In order to alleviate the serious threat of sugar shortages in the city, the Municipal Grain Administration has implemented a sugar rationing system in each district within the Ming-affiliated cordon this month. The city's sugar trade has thus come to a halt. In order to further promote the fairness and meticulousness of sugar allocation and management, the bureau has already formulated various plans and regulations for sugar allocation to prevent abuses. After submitting them to the municipal government for approval, they will be implemented. It is heard that sugar merchants in each district who sell household sugar can apply to the fourth section of the Grain Bureau. The application methods can be inquired at any time from that section.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Japanese Embassy Office Revamps Organization <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>In order to adapt to the new situation after the progress of Japan's policy toward China and to streamline affairs and exert comprehensive functions, the Japanese Embassy Office in Shanghai has decided to reform its organization starting from April 1st. The content of the new organization is that, under the minister, in addition to the deliberative office and the secretariat, there will be three departments: general affairs, civil administration, and economy. The organization of these three departments is as follows: the General Affairs Department has four sections: general affairs, intelligence investigation, reporting, and culture; the Civil Administration Department has three sections: administration, police affairs, and training; and the Economic Department has six sections: planning, commerce and industry, agriculture and forestry, transportation, finance, and audit. The main points of this reform are as follows: (1) In the past, in addition to the deliberative office and the secretariat, there were five departments (general affairs, civil administration, economy, finance, and culture) and fifteen sections. This time, three departments and thirteen sections have been established to avoid competition in affairs and promote the rational activity of the organization. (2) The deliberative office, which previously belonged to the General Affairs Department, will now be an agency directly under the minister. In the past, active duty army and navy personnel served as section chiefs and department chiefs, shouldering direct affairs. This will be abolished in the future, and these military personnel will be assigned to the deliberative office directly under the minister to participate in the deliberation of important policies and maintain contact with the military authorities. (3) A new planning section has been established within the Economic Department, with the aim of planning the mobilization of materials, trade, transportation, funds, and labor, as well as establishing price countermeasures and comprehensive economic policies for the relationship with the Central China Development Company. Furthermore, the Finance Department, which had previously completed an important mission in monetary policy, has now been incorporated into the finance section within the Economic Department. This is because the issuance of military scrip has ceased, and the unification of currency in Central and Southern China with Central Reserve Bank notes has been completed. The extremely complex currency problem in Central China has also come to a complete end, which is a natural trend after the unfolding of the new situation. The personnel of the new organization will be decided and announced within this month.</p>

Therefore, I suggested to my relatives and friends that the funds collected be used to support education. This can provide a small help to the students and create blessings for the relatives and friends, achieving several goals at once. It is indeed excellent. I received unanimous approval.

<h3 id="e26">On the Issue of Cultural Paper <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Kangde</p>
<p>After reading the Shen Bao's editorial on the 26th, "The Serious Issue of Cultural Paper," I couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief. Although the issue of cultural paper is not very serious to the general public, those who are truly engaged in publishing culture feel that if the paper issue "is not resolved soon, not only will major bookstores find it difficult to resume publishing books, but also the current newspapers and magazines will face the crisis of being unable to continue publishing in the near future. Thinking about the future of culture, one cannot help but feel chilled to the bone." (Quoted from the editorial) However, although the problem is so serious, I have only seen this editorial in the Shen Bao calling for the authorities and the cultural community to work together to solve it, so I breathed a sigh of relief after reading it.</p>
<p>In fact, the severity of the cultural paper issue did not begin today. When ten professors published the Declaration of Chinese Native Culture a few years ago, the reporter jokingly said to a friend, "If Westerners become jealous after seeing this declaration and stop selling newspapers and me, it will be difficult to talk about Chinese Native Culture!" Because "paper is a tool for preserving culture and communicating knowledge," and our country's "printing paper mostly comes from foreign countries" (also quoted from the Shen Bao editorial). Our country's reliance on foreign countries for daily necessities has reached the point of "everything being dependent on foreign countries," such as rice and wheat, cotton yarn, timber, and newspapers all cannot be done without imports. In other words, all the important materials for the clothing, food, housing, and transportation of our people, as well as for preserving culture and communicating knowledge, must be sought from abroad. Not to mention the airplanes and cannons needed for national defense. In a country where everything must be sought from others, whether for peace or war, thinking about the future, how can one not feel chilled to the bone?</p>
<p>Getting back to the main topic, the Shen Bao editorial urgently hopes that the authorities and the cultural community will work together to solve the cultural paper issue. First, greatly increase the production of cultural paper. Second, for all paper merchants, re-register immediately for foreign newspapers purchased before December 8th of the previous year and implement price limits. For local paper mills, estimate their costs and implement price limits, while strictly prohibiting non-paper merchants from hoarding and speculation. Third, immediately implement strict consumption control and rational allocation. Then, implement rational allocation for newspapers, magazines, and book publishing industries and provide full guarantees for obtaining paper. In the reporter's view, all three of these are actually small things that are easy to say and not difficult to do. As long as the authorities are determined to do it, none of them are difficult tasks that can be done with a wave of the hand. In addition to hoping for implementation, I would also like to supplement the facts about the soaring paper prices and their impact on publishing culture in order to illustrate how serious the cultural paper issue is and to prove that "thinking about the future of culture, one cannot help but feel chilled to the bone" is by no means alarmist talk.</p>
<p>At the time of the July 7th Incident, the price of foreign newspapers was less than six yuan per ream. When the European war broke out in 1939, it was only 17 or 18 yuan, or even 12 or 18 yuan. Even after the outbreak of the Pacific War, when the source of foreign paper was completely cut off, it was still not more than 100 yuan. Since then, it has been increasing from time to time, and was still within 300 yuan at the end of last year. As soon as the New Year passed, it was like a person growing a year older, and the price increased by more than 100 yuan at once. After that, it increased every day and every night. In the past month, it has risen from about 500 yuan to about 1,000 yuan. The reporter has no name for this kind of increase, so I can only call it "chaotic increase." If this chaotic increase continues, by the end of this year, it will probably sell for 10,000 yuan per ream. If newspapers were not a tool for preserving culture and communicating knowledge, then it would be fine if the price increased to 100,000 yuan per ream. If the cost of newspapers were also increasing, then the high price would still be understandable. However, paper is the lifeline of culture, and it is no exaggeration to say that without paper, there is no culture. What kind of country is a country without culture? Furthermore, as the Shen Bao editorial said, all the foreign newspapers in Shanghai are goods that were stockpiled before December 8th, and their purchase price is definitely not higher than 100 yuan. To sacrifice the publishing industry for the exorbitant profits of a few people is not allowed by public opinion or national law.</p>
<p>The result of the soaring paper prices is, of course, that those who aspire to publish culture are trapped by their inability to do so and can only sigh at the sight of paper. At the beginning of the year, I personally prepared a translated monthly magazine that I thought had publishing value. I collected manuscripts and typeset them for only two months, but the daily and nightly increase in paper prices has completely disrupted the original plan. Although I am reluctantly going to press now, I am afraid that it will also be short-lived, because at the beginning of the plan, the price of paper was less than 300 yuan, but now it is close to 1,000 yuan. If the price of the magazine increases with the increase in the price of paper, it will be difficult for readers to bear. What is even more frightening is that the increase in the price of paper is endless, making it impossible to calculate costs. If you don't want to be miserable and exhausted, you only have one way: play mahjong and forget about publishing! Although this is my personal understanding of the joys and sorrows, I am afraid that it is also the common experience of those who have the heart but not the power to engage in publishing culture.</p>
<p>I often talked with many friends that the country's affairs today are full of holes and sores, which is enough to make those who treat the country anxious and exhausted, and it is not easy to please. However, among the full of sores, the stagnation of publishing culture is still a serious disease, and this serious disease can be cured much more easily than political economy. As long as there is true benevolence, even without benevolent guards, it is not difficult to cure the disease with medicine. I would like to observe the actual performance of today's country doctors in whether or not they are willing to solve the small problem of cultural paper.</p>

<h3 id="e35">Commentary: Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Associations <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the call to adjust and strengthen wartime economic institutions can be said to be resonating throughout the skies. What is gratifying is that both adjustment and strengthening have been gradually realized. Following the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association, the Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Associations have been promulgated. The synergy between these two events represents the most rational step in adjusting and strengthening wartime economic institutions.</p>
<p>Regarding the topic of strengthening industry associations, this column has repeatedly presented arguments. After studying the full text of the Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Associations promulgated by the National Government, it is deeply felt that the main articles precisely align with the three principles listed in this column's commentary on March 23. For example, Article 2 of the Regulations states: "The purpose of industrial and commercial associations is to assist the government in implementing economic policies and to promote the common interests of the industry." Article 13 states: "The competent authority may order companies and firms engaged in the operation of major commodities to join the relevant industry association; companies and firms engaged in the operation of major commodities may not operate without joining an industry association." And Article 18 states: "If an officer of an industrial or commercial association violates laws, regulations, or the association's charter, or engages in other serious misconduct, the association may resolve to order their resignation. If the local competent authority deems an officer of an industry association dealing with major commodities to be incompetent, it may order their resignation." All of the above align with the three points discussed in this column previously.</p>
<p>The three articles listed above are the core of the full text of the Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Associations. As we have previously stated, the responsibilities of industry associations from now on are: (1) To promote economic policies – to cooperate fully to seek the welfare of the industry while assisting the government in promoting economic policies; (2) To concentrate the industry's strength – to strengthen group organizations; all members of the industry must join the association; (3) To restrain the conduct of subordinates – all those holding positions in industry associations must be absolutely impartial and incorruptible. The promulgation of the Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Associations is another step in the important process of adjusting wartime economic institutions. Therefore, at the risk of being repetitive, we reiterate this meaning, hoping to offer these three basic principles to industry associations as their permanent motto.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Following the Promulgation of the Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Associations, All Industry Associations in this City Will Be Adjusted <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from the Central News Agency in Shanghai reports that, in order to implement wartime economic policies, the National Government has already formulated a guideline, resolving to actively proceed from the key points of improving economic institutions, strengthening material controls, stabilizing finance, and increasing production to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods. At the same time, in order to achieve rational control, it has promulgated the National Commercial Control Association and the Regulations on Wartime Material Transfer Prohibition. Under the cooperation of the Japanese authorities, the entire control work is entrusted to the authorities of the Ministry of Industry to be handled independently by commercial organizations. The National Commercial Control Association was formally established on the 15th of this month and began to handle matters relating to the application for material transfer permits and the registration of material inventories for various industries. It is now understood that, with the initial realization of the control work, the National Government urgently needs to adjust economic institutions. Therefore, it yesterday formulated the Provisional Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Associations, promulgated and implemented as ordinances. All industrial and commercial associations in all provinces and cities must comply with the provisions of the regulations, adjust their organizations under the guidance and supervision of the central competent authority, in order to assist the government in implementing economic policies and promoting the common interests of the industry, so as to be able to promote the revival of industrial and commercial economy. According to the Central News Agency reporter's inquiries with various relevant parties in this city, the details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Material Transfer Applications are Booming</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the National Commercial Control Association has repeatedly convened joint meetings of directors and supervisors to discuss internal organizational systems and material control issues. The internal organizational system and personnel selection have been largely determined, and the regulations and procedures for material control and transfer have also been discussed and submitted to the ministry for record. The Material Transfer Permit Office has received more than 200 applications for material transfer permits from various industries. In recent days, the registration of material inventory quantities to the association by various industries has been extremely enthusiastic. It is reported that the association also passed the General Rules for Industry Associations at the third joint meeting of directors and supervisors and submitted them to the ministry for approval. In the future, industry associations with similar characteristics will be merged to form federations in order to handle all control matters such as material procurement, transportation, marketing coordination, and evaluation.</p>
<p>Actively Adjusting Economic Institutions</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the implementation of control policies and strengthen wartime economic institutions, the Ministry of Industry authorities specially drafted the Provisional Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Associations, which were submitted to the National Government for promulgation and implementation, abolishing the old Industrial and Commercial Association Law. All industrial and commercial organizations that are not suitable for the wartime economic system of the old economic institutions will be adjusted and reorganized under the guidance and supervision of the central competent authority. According to the Central News Agency reporter's inquiries with the Municipal Economic Bureau, all industry associations in this city must comply with the Provisional Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Associations promulgated by the government and reorganize accordingly. Once the detailed rules for the implementation of the Provisional Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Associations are promulgated, the reorganization of institutions will be actively carried out. Previously, the organization of industry associations was a committee system, but in the future it will be changed to a board system. If it is necessary to merge industry associations with similar characteristics to form federations, the government will also promulgate regulations accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Materials Control Deliberation Committee to Hold Meeting in Shanghai <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 26th, Central News Agency dispatch: In order to promote the smooth implementation of wartime economic policies, the National Government has established the National Commercial Control Association as the highest body for wartime economic control institutions. Furthermore, at the Supreme National Defense Council meeting on the 25th, it was decided to enact provisional regulations for industrial and commercial associations, in order to establish industrial and commercial associations as subordinate organizations of the National Commercial Control Association before the Qingming Festival (April 5), thereby ensuring a sound system for the collection, coordination, preparation, and streamlining of wartime and civilian materials. Therefore, the first meeting of the Materials Control Deliberation Committee will be held in Shanghai on April 1. The Materials Control Deliberation Committee is composed of many Chinese and Japanese members, and will determine the National Commercial Control Association's charter, personnel, and other important matters related to the implementation of its business. The charter will include provisions for the Control Association's capital contribution, the structure of the secretariat, and operations such as the general affairs office, finance office, audit office, materials office, and transaction office.</p>

<p>It is learned that the major commodity categories for industrial and commercial associations are in accordance with Article 6 of the Provisional Regulations on Stabilizing Prices promulgated on July 1 of last year, as the following twenty secret categories. Except for the collection and distribution of rice, which is currently directly operated by the Ministry of Food, the other major commodity classifications are as follows: (1) Food Grains: flour, barley, wheat, sorghum, corn, soybeans; (2) Edible Oils: peanut oil, rapeseed oil, soybean oil; (3) Seasonings: edible salt, granulated sugar; (4) Clothing Materials: cotton, cotton yarn, cotton cloth; (5) Fuels: coal, coal briquettes; (6) Sundries: soap, matches, fuel oil, cigarettes, paper.</p>
<h3 id="e40">A Historical Perspective on the Bank of China (Part Two) <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Jianzhi</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the legal tender policy, the situation has suddenly changed. The four major banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank of China, and Agricultural Bank of China) have been able to create currency and indirectly manipulate finance using their exclusive issuance rights, gradually becoming banks of banks. The importance of commercial banks has gradually diminished. Furthermore, the Central Bank and the Communications Bank continue to engage in the general business of commercial banks, actively operating with their strong financial resources and inherent privileges. The speed of their deposit increases is unmatched by other banks, and the influence of commercial banks is gradually entering an era of decline.</p>
<p>After the Sino-Japanese Incident, the influence of the four major banks in Central China gradually declined. However, commercial banks were unable to take their place. Instead, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation took the lead, followed by the Central Reserve Bank of China. The financial strength of the commercial banks themselves has been greatly reduced due to the impact of wartime currency instability, without the feeling of their glory days. Their title as leaders of all industries is only nominal.</p>
<p>The creation of power in the economic world depends on the size of resources and the flexibility of their application. The past position of commercial banks was created using their resources. Today, the deposits on which commercial banks rely as their financial lifeline have slightly increased on the surface, but are far less than before in substance. An investigation of the deposits of eleven banks in Shanghai showed 491 million yuan in 1936, and 1.011 billion yuan in 1941, an increase of more than one time. By 1942, with the promotion of reserve certificates, without calculating the two-to-one conversion rate, the figures had almost returned to pre-incident levels. Therefore, the increase in deposits is, in fact, very limited. Currently, the largest commercial bank in Shanghai has deposits of only about 100 million yuan, while there are countless enterprises in Shanghai with a value of over 100 million yuan. How can banks possibly manipulate them? If we measure the financial strength of commercial banks by the purchasing power of money, the index in the table is only one-thirty-third of what it was before the incident. The sharp decline in their financial strength can be described as tragic!</p>

<h3 id="e42">"Proper" and "Carefree" <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— Guizhen</p>
<p>Hu Shi wrote a biography of "Mr. Careless," satirizing the general tendency of Chinese people to do things with a "good enough" attitude, without striving for precision and thoroughness. However, "good enough" still requires some effort, and things are somewhat close to success.</p>
<p>There are also quite a few people who are fundamentally too lazy to put in the effort to decide whether or not to do something, or to distinguish between good and bad outcomes. They only think of digging a well when they are extremely thirsty. Minor matters are like burning eyebrows, and even the superstitious "clutching Buddha's feet" piety is not considered. They are always too lazy to think and just muddle through.</p>
<p>"Carefree is fine, why be so proper?"</p>
<p>Spitting phlegm is unhygienic, and everyone vaguely knows this. But when sticky phlegm is stuck in the throat: "Why be so proper? Carefree is fine." And this mouthful of stuff is carelessly spat out.</p>
<p>It is clear that gambling and women are both mentally and financially draining, but "joining in the fun is the thing, why be proper?" and another bout of carelessness ensues.</p>
<p>Many opium addicts are probably casually hooked after "taking a puff." It is said that these are precisely the tranquility and casual poetic sentiments. Even those who have suffered from this addiction are too lazy to correct themselves. Thus, any social reform movement cannot be promoted.</p>
<p>These quirks unique to some Chinese people are precisely the toxins that have created a weak national spirit and reduced the power of invigoration to this day. And the root cause of this "carefree" toxin is almost always a "lazy" character.</p>
<p>Let's hold off on singing the praises of all movements to the clouds. To those who are carefree, it is just like wind in their ears. The harsher reality must awaken those who are too lazy to use their brains, and consciously remove the "lazy" character. Then everything can be brought into line and move towards a new way of life.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Need for These Two Types of People <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Zhaobin</p>
<p>When Yuan Shikai was in power, he saw that the government was full of talent, filled with imperial relatives. He said that there were too many people and not enough jobs. Later, when he encountered a difficult task that required a talented person to handle, there was no one available. He then said: There are too many things and not enough people.</p>
<p>In the current environment, although there are too many people, there is a shortage of true talent. There is a need for the following two types of people:</p>
<p>Creative people: There are those who have higher intelligence, stronger physical strength, and a desire to create some benefit for humanity or to make up for a deficiency. They use all their physical and intellectual strength to create what they want to create. Whether it is a technician, an artist, a philosopher, or a writer, they spare no effort, working tirelessly year after year, racking their brains, exhausting themselves, or even taking great risks and facing great difficulties, disregarding their lives, focusing only on the success of their creation. Among all the peoples of the world, there are such people, but they are relatively few.</p>
<p>Adaptive people: There are those who, while lacking the wisdom and desire to create, strive to learn the knowledge and skills needed to make a living. They also strive to improve the work within their assigned tasks, accumulating rich experience. They adapt to each situation and use all their strength to do whatever they are supposed to do or are asked to do by others, until they have achieved complete success. Society has a great need for such people, but in reality, the demand is likely greater than the supply. (Incomplete)</p>
<h3 id="e44">True Love <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Shu</p>
<p>Many people mistakenly believe that "love" means pleasing the object of their affection, while also allowing others to indulge themselves. This is a distortion of the true meaning of love. Rather than love, it is more like the manifestation of selfishness.</p>
<p>Although the expression of love in humans contains various different qualities and has different objects, the starting point of true love is common. Whether it is maternal love, friendship, or romantic love, the same pure emotions are selfless, virtuous, and encouraging of oneself and others to improve spiritually. At the same time, seeing a loved one behaving improperly is one's own greatest pain, which one would never condone.</p>
<p>Only those who truly love themselves can then love others. Furthermore, sincere love is rational, moderate, and not excessively passionate, yet it can give the beloved a kind of beautiful will. Conversely, those who do not love themselves and do not pursue true beauty and goodness will never appreciate the noble qualities of others.</p>
<p>Life needs the nourishment and cultivation of love. Love is the source of all strength and the meaning of life. However, we must refine our love, and we must not allow others to lavish heavy emotions on us.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Root <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Xinbo</p>
<p>"A Wu Ge! A Wu Ge! Are you also going to Ling Mountain!" A call came from his right. He immediately pulled back his reverie, raised his head, and released his gaze to look for the person who called him. Strangely, he could not see clearly who was calling him. It turned out that he and that person were separated by a corner of the mulberry field. That person was close to the mulberry branches, while he was farther away, and the mulberry branches confused his vision. He did not answer, only moved his head from side to side, wanting to recognize the person walking towards him who was calling him.</p>
<p>"A Wu Ge, A Wu Ge!" That person turned around smiling, with two empty manure buckets on his shoulder.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's Da Gen Ge!" A Wu looked clearly and jumped up happily. "I didn't expect to run into you here! Why aren't you going to Ling Mountain, but are here carrying manure? – Manure is good to carry every day, why must you carry it today? – What are you watering with the manure? –…"</p>
<p>A series of words, which was also a series of inquiries, just kept saying without waiting for Da Gen to answer. When he seemed like gurgling bottled water, nearly flowing out naturally, Da Gen picked up a few words to answer him.</p>
<p>"Ling Mountain is right at our back door, it's okay not to go. – Carrying manure to water the mulberry trees. The mulberry trees have already sprouted leaves, but if I don't water them, and it rains and the pit is overflowing, I can only carry two buckets to water them. – Are you here alone?" After answering, he couldn't help but also ask. "How did you get out?"</p>
<p>"Damn it!" Da Gen's question seemed to arouse A Wu's complaints. He blurted out a mindless curse, "I'm not sold to their family! From morning till night, doing this and doing that, busy as hell, and still can't get a good word, getting spoken to roughly! This morning, that little devil wanted to eat this and eat that, told me to go buy it, and when I was a little late, he threw a big tantrum, not only scolded me, but also took a stick to hit me. Even though the hit didn't really hurt, I got angry in my heart, ate my meal, put down the bowl, threw down the chopsticks, and just walked out of there, to hell with it, at worst I'll break a damn rice bowl!…………"</p>
<p>"Oh, oh, oh, I didn't know you had so much anger." Da Gen just kept smiling. "Don't be angry, come to my house to sit, drink some tea, and then go up the mountain. Last year, my dad was very grateful for your care, and we are all thankful."</p>
<p>"Don't be polite, I need to go to the mountain to relax, I won't go to your house. You shouldn't be carrying manure, accompany me to go for a walk on the mountain, it's rare." (Twenty-one)</p>

<p>— Lü Daomao</p>
<p>The Tushanwan Orphanage, previously lacking funds, appealed to all sectors of society. Over the past year, it has received donations totaling 151,000 old currency and 56,500 in savings bonds. The orphanage has used these funds to repay a portion of its debts, allowing the 280 orphans within to continue their education. In these times of expensive rice, firewood, and general high prices, the head of a household with only a few mouths to feed is already crying out in hardship. How much more difficult is it for the person responsible for a large family of 280 orphans? Among them, seventy can already work a little, slightly compensating for their daily expenses. However, the remaining two hundred-plus are still in the time of studying and learning a trade. All expenses must rely on the support of others, requiring tens of thousands of dollars per month. For this reason, our orphanage sincerely hopes, and can only hope, that all great philanthropists will continue to provide assistance, generously opening their purses, so that hundreds of orphans can continue to study and learn a craft. We hope they will become good workers and good citizens in the future. All donations should be sent to: (1) No. 448, Puxi Road, Xujiahui Road, Wooden Courtyard; (2) The Catholic Church in Yangjingbang, specifying it for the Tushanwan Orphanage; (3) Branch of the Publishing House, No. 231, Pushi Road. Telephone 7459. All receipts will be issued as proof of payment.</p>
