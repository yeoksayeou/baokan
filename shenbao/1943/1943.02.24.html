<p>社評</p>
<h3>申論物價對策與戰時經濟</h3>
<p>物價問題與戰時經濟關係至鉅，不待贅述。而具體辦法，則有待于專家各抒所長，羣策羣力，以期物價問題的合理解決。所以我們不厭周詳，從限價對策的技術問題，提供意見辦法；如果有關各方面能多加注意，得到更萬全妥善的辦法，實在是國家與人民之福。因爲在開始實施限價之時，研究討論得更周詳些，籌謀策劃得更縝密些，則事功可以更速而大，人民所感的不便，則可以更小。只要限價實施得法，執行得人，一般所顧慮的黑市盛行，物資逃匿與生產來源减少等問題，不難逐漸减少。但是要澈底實施限價政策，安定物價，還要其他種種戰時經濟政策，配合推進，才能漸收宏效。因爲物價問題，本與國家一切經濟設施及社會動態，息息相通。物價是整個的，限價只是整個物價對策的一項，所以物價問題的解决，須由整個物價對策之全部實施而底於成。且整個物價對策，又爲整個國家戰時經濟政策的一部份，所以必須使整個物價對策與其他戰時政策之配合運用，才能獲得萬全與美滿之結果。物價全面管制是戰時經濟管制的初步，必須更進而採取相濟相成的經濟財政政策，如物資之全面的管制，生產事業之發展，戰時官民消費之節的，交通運輸業務之改善，政府預算與通貨之緊縮，金融部門之統制，賦稅捐徵之調整，以及國民組織之嚴密等，當前政府與有關方面必須針對宣戰以來的實際情形與需要，立即進行硏究討論，擬具實施辦法，切實施行，努力推進，以收實效。其中增加生產和節約消費，尤其是目前最緊要的措施，應該是今後物價對策的中心，而必須首先實施的。</p>
<p>物價對策中居主要地位的是增進戰時生產;而戰時生產又以農，工，礦二者爲中心。希望政府根據戰時經濟政策綱領，詳確擬定增加生產的計割，增加推進戰時生產的經費。而增產的要點，允須針對現實，以國家戰時所必需，及人民日常生活需用的物品爲主。使增產的物資，在品種上，數量上，時間上及地區上，都能先其所急，補其所缺，量出爲人，節約時間勞力與資金等，而完全適合於戰時實際的需要。例如以農林建設言，在農業方面，於增產糧食外，兼重棉花生產，而油菜，蠶絲，甘蔗，烟草等，也須兼顧，以期人民衣食所需無缺，而國家　時所需物資有着。林業方面，於一般保護森林建造新林之外，應特別注重造船木材之新法採伐，以發展造船工業，恢復沿江沿海及內河航運，　利今後各地物資之調劑。並應兼顧薪炭之普遍培植，以補戰時燃料的不足，對於工業及交通方面，有所補益。畜牧方面，於改良繁殖耕牛役馬之外，並應注意家畜家禽如猪，羊，鷄，鴨及魚類畜牧之推廣，以補濟國民食糧，而利用其副產，以發展手工業。再以丁業生產而言，爲了戰時需要，自然應該擴展國營工業的範圍，但鑒於我國工業歷史上的特殊情形，官督民營的企業，或者更適合實際的需要，而收效更大。同時，最不應忽視的是對於中小工業的扶助，對於手工業及家庭工業，也須努力提倡和獎勵。我們一般國民生活程度不高，手工業及家庭工業的生產品，可以解決多數人民生活必需品的缺乏問題。而且，這種生產品，還可以作爲大工業及戰時軍需工業的原料。不過增加生產，不僅要以政令推行，允須從各面加以獎助，加以保護，如金融上農貸工貸之開辦或增加，實施增產貸款，水利貸款，推廣貸款，運銷貸款，農村副業貸款，土地金融貸款等等。而在政治上，法律上，交通運輸上，加以保護；我們深信，只有增加生產，　能解決物價問題，才能推進限價政策而收實效。</p>
<p>物價對策中，同時不能忽視的：第一是消費之節約，無論爲政府或民間，一切組織機構以至個人生活，都應以節約資金，節約時間，節約物資，以至節約人力爲戰時第一要義。在上要貫澈「精兵」「簡政」的政策，在下澈底减除都市奢靡的風習，浪費應視爲罪惡，奢侈應視爲敵人。那時物資可以確保，而人力也可以集中。第二要便利交通。如交通業務之統一，檢查機關之單純，都爲便利交通運輸的第一要義。至於調整運輸機構，改良運輸工具，利用民間舊有交通工其，及修理一般道路，以及改善交通管理辦法，便利客貨之交流，保障民問物資運輸之便利與安全等，都是當前迫切期待於當局的。第三，是政府一面努力緊縮通貨，緊縮預算，一面調整稅法，管制金融，四管齊下，相濟相成，更是戰時經濟政策的主要課題，也是保證物價對策順利完成的不、一法鬥。如果捨此而他求，則一切限價政策以至增加生產等等，就決不能期待充分收效了。如果政府有決心有魄力，而民衆能守法能苦幹，而不僅物價問題，即整個戰時經濟政策綱領之實現，也不成問題的。</p>
<p>最後，我們可以綜合限價對策的意見與辦法，而提示其要旨：即如果我們今日盡最大的努力，限制物價趨於相當的穩定，則生產者因生產成本得到相當的穩定，就可以按照綱領與計劃去增進生產，不必顧慮將來有若干大的損失；消費者心理上得到相當的安定，也不致普遍地競購物資與浪費物資。比較缺少的物品，亦不致完全掌握到少數人的手中，囤户以無厚利可圖，也就减少囤積。公私運輸事業可以在成本費用相當穩定情况之下去發展，財政支出可不致因物價的飛漲，而無限制的膨大；民間因物價安定，對於貨幣信任心也就可以逐漸恢復增强；對於今後將舉辦的儲蓄或公債政策的推進，無形中都有重大的助力。另一方面，積極增進生產，改善交通運輸，以暢通貨源，並節約消費，以致市塲物資供求趨於平衡，而限價政策易於推行。同時積極吸收社會　大的游資回籠，以减少實施限價政策的重大壓力；加緊嚴密社會組織，健全機構，以協助限價政策之推進。我們特別期待有關各當局特别體恤工商界及一般國民的艱苦，務須以竭力减少人民苦痛爲要旨。同時我們期待工商界忍受暫時的不便，即是犧牲体點利潤，而協力政府實施政策，共謀合理的解決。我們深信，只要上下一致體恤時艱，協力推行，前途成功是無疑問的。</p>

<h3>就不撤退與決戰的準備</h3>
<p>德軍當局發表，德軍在十四日夜自羅斯托夫及伏洛希洛夫格勒撤退。羅斯托夫爲制壓頓河地帶，高加索及伏爾加地帶的必爭之地，伏洛希洛夫亦爲唐納資東部地方的要衝，但在目前的德蘇戰局中，所應重視者，不是一城一地的爭奪，而爲今後決戰態勢的大局。</p>
<p>紅軍在此次冬季戰爭中，所以能取積極的攻勢者，原因很多，其最主要的原　，則爲在去年德軍的夏季攻勢中，紅軍採用退避戰略，結果，德軍失却了包圍殲滅紅軍的機會，所以在此次冬季戰中，紅軍所保持的兵力，比前年冬季戰時的條件好得多。</p>
<p>目前的事態，我們可以知道，在德軍以爲與其拘泥於一城一地的得失，寗從德蘇決戰的大局上看來，出以最爲有利的方略，始爲妥當。</p>
<p>歐洲戰事的規模，日見擴大，所以今後總力戰的推移如何，比局部戰綫的進退更値得加以注視。德國現正決意傾國家的總力對蘇再取攻勢，且據說食糧，軍需資材，人約資源，國內整頓等約準備極有自信，正符合軸心方面的期待。</p>
<p>而且，從上述見地看來，在此次冬季戰中，德軍的消耗，將止於最低限度，於此，我們不能不注以重大的關懷。（翔：譯自二月十六日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>英美爭奪航空支配權</h3>
<p>（柏林特電十五日加藤特派員發）據柏林所得之最近情報，關於航空綫支配權，英美之反目，漸趨表面化，美國擬從世界舞台中推倒英國之野心，及沒落中英國最後掙扎之卑屈，於此可見。</p>
<p>數日前在英國上院，前航空大臣倫頓特利，對政府當局質問稱：</p>
<p>「一國勢力之消長，繫於其國民之在世界各地廣設民用航空綫，關於此問題，有待於美蘇二國之合作，美國確保世界航空權的百分之二十五，政府對此旣成事實，持何對策？」</p>
<p>對此，空軍次官夏伏特代表政府答稱：</p>
<p>「政府現正硏究此問題，若有必要，並希望與美國協議。無奈英國現正竭其全力從事戰爭，故開闢民用航空綫，旣無時間，亦無資材。」</p>
<p>美國生產飛機的企圖，並不集中於戰爭目的，而擬打倒所有商業上的敵人，以獨占世界的戰後貿易，故含有利已的要素。上述答辯，暗露對美不滿之意。</p>
<p>「世界航空綫」問題之討論，數週來在英美間甚囂塵上，從各方面看來，美國正有獨占的企圖。如副總統華萊士所稱：「仳界航空綫之建設爲第一要着，唯此始能確保世界和平。」美國更以爲須建造能於數小時內連結大陸與大陸之飛機，並主張「空的自由」之在將來，與「海的自由」之在過去，正具同樣意義。美國旣已確保冰島，加里浦海之北大西洋英國茶地的大部，更占有德國前在南美之航空綫，美國並以此基地而向北菲西亞擴大中。是以如泰晤士報所論，此等基地對於美國予以戰後航空綫利用的絕對權，英國之爲此苦悶，正爲理所當然。事實上，英國各報盛載因美國占有軍事基地之慾壑無饜，將完全喪失英國自身之航空綫，明示美國之威脅。</p>
<p>關於上述英國上院中之議論，新聞論評一致對政府聲明表示不滿之意。每日郵報指出美國運輸機生產力的威曾，而稱「政府的態度曖昧。」每日電訊報主張「美國在軍用民用運輸機的生產上，均佔獨佔的地位，政府對此問題立即與美國協議。」</p>
<p>換言之，美國一手擔任能使用於航空綫的運輸機及　轟炸機的生產，英國則生產於航空綫毫無用途的戰鬥機。</p>

<h3>澳門素描</h3>
<p>（澳門石川特派員十四日發）脂粉香水與鶯聲燕語點綴着的雅片之港—被稱爲東方的蒙脫卡羅的　屬澳門，在大東亞戰爭的狂濤中，不再是尋歡作樂的塲所了。單！雙！—把運命寄託於骰子的澳門人的表情，在世紀末的狂歡的爵士樂聲中，把憂愁寄懷於相擁狂舞的舞女們的心中，雖因節電而街道黑暗了、爲了物價飛漲　物資　足而困惱，然而昔日的美滿之夢，仍戀戀不捨，這就是現在澳門人的表情，呈現着中立國的多種多樣的相貌。</p>
<p>遠東所剩的唯一中立地帶，國境與和平地區中山縣隣接，與重慶轄區亦僅一衣帶水之隔，連結歐洲與遠東，用東方的眼光看來，東洋里斯本的澳門，將具有多角性的新性格。</p>
<p>澳門位於廣東省中山縣南端突出的小島，離香港水程有四十里，廣東約八十里，面積僅十一平方哩，在十六世紀時代，曾爲貿易根據地，向在香港的勢力之下，因而澳門政廳，容許抗日華人的跋扈，默認向重慶地區的大量偷運。但在大東亞戰後的今日，英國在東亞的勢力完全被逐，日本的勢力，風靡於全東亞，於是澳門政廳的態度，當然也見風使舵，有所變更。</p>
<p>在經濟上，澳門向來亦依存香港，僅因珠江封鎖及轉口貿易，曾一度繁榮，自從與香港在經濟上的從屬關係被切斷之後，本國與南洋的貿易亦吿杜絕，完全孤立，而不能不依存於日本。</p>
<p>澳門今也有日本人，日本商社的進出了，中國商人，旅館中的侍者們，都懂得日本語。旅館附設的舞塲中也可以聽見「荒城之月」及其他日本曲。一九三七年澳門政府的財政，歲入四百七十八萬澳元，歲出五百萬澳元，歲入中占百分之五十六的二百七十萬元，實係自賭博及鴉片而來的收入。去年歲入僅四百二十五萬元，比往年不足六七十萬，加以物價騰漲十倍二十倍，故至少須二倍以上的預算才能應付，所以澳門政府羅掘俱窮，陷於左右支絀的境地。</p>
<p>因爲輸入的杜絕，從香港及其他各地來的遊客年有十四五萬，今亦吿杜絕，於是昔日歡樂之塲的澳門，現在已成爲僻靜的城市。重慶方面把對付華僑的工作着重於澳門，潛入很多的藍衣社，搜集情報，肆行宣傳，警戒，威脅華僑的對日接近。商人在事實上有不能不與日本方面提携的困難的關係，但在此三年中，與日本方面接近而被暗殺的有五名之多。這是　慶方面對中國人的無言的回答。暴行於白日公然實施，犯人一個也未逮捕。澳門除日本領事館之外，有英國領事館，也有泰國，荷蘭的名譽領事。英國領事館的經費甚鉅，搜集香港失　後的情報，反軸心的煽惑宣傳，暗中甚爲活躍，與歐洲的里斯本同樣，聯絡英美與重慶，代香港而利用爲諜報的據點。（翔：自二月十六日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<p>瑞典京城二十三日中央社電　據東綫消息、德軍已自二十一日下午起在唐納資河與尼泊河大彎曲部中間地帶、展開全面總反攻、二十二日正午在連結巴夫洛格勒、克拉斯諾達、阿魯明克三處之鐵路沿綫展開激戰、蘇軍主力於德軍自下科夫撤退後、即向該方面急遽移動、經西內里尼科夫企圖衝破尼泊貝特洛夫斯克、然遭德軍猛烈反攻、已完全陷於進退維谷狀態、據合衆社莫斯科電、承認蘇軍已不得已自北方退却、又卡科夫方面等戰綫均無變化、綜觀各戰綫蘇軍戰力之低下、實已無法掩飾、</p>
<p>柏林二十三日海通社電　據德軍偵察部隊之觀察、蘇軍於克復卡科夫後、立即抽調該處相當數量之軍隊、馳援唐納資盆地及尼泊河河套、自二月八日以來、蘇軍企圖自伊斯占向阿索夫海沿岸之瑪魯波爾推進、其另一部則向西南方之薩坡希壓迫、但此項企圖除初步略獲勝利外、現已完全失敗、同時德軍自西發動反攻、日益激烈、德軍裝甲車隊於星期日側面進攻蘇軍之左翼、甚爲得手、蘇軍數隊被圍、殲滅過半、數日前被蘇軍佔領之鐵路交點二處、其一處已被德軍奪還、唐納資工業區東部之地勢利於扼守、塔干洛格區之戰事、目前暫趨平靜、蘇軍一再實施其包抄運動、雖曾突破德軍防綫，但被德軍之反攻所逐退、敵軍正面之進攻、所獲甚鮮反而償付極重之代價、卡科夫西北及迤西之局勢仍無改變、蘇軍在該區之攻勢已减弱、蘇軍在奧萊爾區則極爲活動、但德軍之反攻亦在增長中、星期日敵軍在伊爾門湖與拉多加湖間不再反攻、然目前之寧靜並不表示蘇軍業已放棄向北之攻勢、良以此爲暴風雨前夕必有之寗靜也、</p>
<p>德軍戰報</p>
<p>德元首行營二十三海通社電　今午德軍戰報稱、蘇軍企圖在東歐南路　得大勝、未能如愿以償、敵初欲突破德軍之陣綫而未果、乃欲抄寫唐內資工業區東邊德軍之後路、或被殲滅、或被擊散、卡科夫迤南企圖大舉包圍之蘇軍、被迫向尼泊爾撤退、德軍截斷敵之交通、復由各方面轟擊之、敵軍被殲滅不少、德機復偵悉敵援軍之所在而迎頭痛擊之、蘇軍鑒於氣候忽寒忽暖、變化莫測、大規模之軍事行動、殊難着手、乃致力於卡科夫迤北之區域、以及東歐之中路及北路、冀有所獲、昨日蘇軍數度進犯庫彭橋頭堡壘、苦戰多時、損失慘重而退、唐納資區內蘇軍數師又圖突破我陣地、仍被擊退、唐納資與尼泊爾之間、我坦克車步兵獲飛機之助、猛攻敵軍、殲滅蘇軍勁旅、卡科夫迤西及奧萊爾迤南、仍有激戰、奧萊爾之東北及北、蘇空軍·砲軍及坦克車隊之大舉進攻、咸被擊退、蘇軍坦克車被擊毀五十五輛、伏爾恪夫之蘇軍攻橋頭堡壘、無功而返、拉多加湖迤南、蘇軍大隊來犯未逞、損失坦克車四十七輛、</p>
<p>柏林二十三日海通社電　負責方面宣稱、東綫南部又起激戰、尤以庫彭·諾伏洛西斯克及頓河河口一帶爲最、進犯之蘇軍莫不遭逢重創而退、卡科夫與奧萊爾間、敵進攻未逞、被毀坦克車五十五輛、列寗格勒舒魯塞爾堡區戰事同時亦趨激烈、敵以坦克車及飛機掩護猛攻、未有進展、激戰尙在進行中、</p>

<h3>法國政府正式宣佈　放棄在華治外法權　平津及本埠法租界均在交還之列　將來戰時經濟政策可望順利施行</h3>
<p>同盟社本埠息、法國政府決定放棄在華之治外法權、此爲事實上之承認南京政府、並奠定調整兩國關係之基礎、據同盟社報吿、交還法租界於國民政府、亦爲自然之事、屆時日本將與國民政府合作、辦理交還法租界事宜、並至少在目下、對交還之租界、當加以保護、</p>
<p>又訊、星期二夜本埠經濟界指出、謂法政府交還上海法租界之意向、即以全部行政權交還國民政府、此對於將來有效地加强戰時經濟政策、可免去各種障礙、過去法租界當局之施政、雖多效法公共租界、但仍不免有若千之歧異、故於經濟管理之方法上、常不能順利進行、今後可無此弊矣、</p>
<h3>蔬菜來源趨增　菜市場價略跌　當局迭次集議抑價辦法　決嚴厲制止操縱及漲價</h3>
<p>各種蔬菜及可以佐餐之鮮貨如魚·蝦·肉等類、前因受來源影響及市儈操縱壟斷、致各貨售價與日俱增、雖經當局三令五申、抑止漲風、然若輩商販、每多籍口以遂厚利、茲悉、現因農曆新正將過、蔬菜來源趨增、同時市民購買力轉弱、在此到多銷呆之情况下、市價不無稍趨回落、故數日以來、蔬菜及鮮貨售價、已較前低廉、</p>
<p>來源增加　售價可跌</p>
<p>茲據熟諳菜市情况者語記者、去歲冬間因雨均勻、四郊農塲各類菜蕊之生長力頗爲迅速、刻已屆採收時期、復因本市蔬菜市價、已較客歲倍增、一般菜販、均因有厚利可圖、爰各爭先販運、爲此菜源遂大爲增加、職是之故、本市蔬菜售價、可望再度下降、顧當局對各物售價、原極嚴格統制、對一般市民日常有關之菜蔬價格、決亦一秉初衷、竭力遏止商販抬價漁利、一方並協助疏通來源、</p>
<p>當局派員　檢查衡器</p>
<p>英文泰晤士報云、兩租界當局、派遣稽查員在各菜塲施行抑價及檢查衡器後、大部食物價格、尤以鮮肉及蔬菜二項、昨已略見减低、按此次新高價之造成、乃係投機活動在本月初盛行之故、</p>
<p>嚴厲規則　可望公佈</p>
<p>據一般居民預料、當局於實行調查之後、其所採取之嚴峻行動、將爲以前所未有、其結果必能使物價再予降低、而有以安定民生、又據多數觀察者指稱、一俟打擊不法攤販之新步驟實現後、有多數物價將回跌至舊曆新年前水準價格以下、殆屬無疑、對於物價之增漲、衆信當局已準備重新以有效之方法應付、並可能組織一嚴密統制物價之制度、及公佈一嚴厲之統制物價規則、</p>
<p>屢次集議　商議應付</p>
<p>同時、據記者探悉、當局對於租界內物價（包括菜塲市價在內）之於最近一月來復趨漲風、業已認爲極堪注意、各有關方面、在最近一星期間、曾屢次集議，商討更有效之應付辦法、在此種辦法尙未有具體完成之前、當局則施行緊急措置、力圖物價之回跌云、</p>
<h3>日軍發言人　發表談話</h3>
<p>同盟社本埠息、日軍發育人星期二在外籍記者常會時宣布、國府參戰後、日軍首次在華中之漢口及長江北岸發動進攻、已悉渝軍之戰鬥力及士氣、頗爲銷沈、日軍此舉爲阻撓重慶在雲南增兵、此種後方攻擊、使渝方官吏感覺焦急、發言人並指出此次日本軍事行動最主要特點之一、爲南京軍隊對日軍實際上之支持、渠預言南京之軍事力量、將來必漸强大、直至能維持佔領地之治安與秩序、現則此項工作、由日軍擔任、渝方謂日軍在華中之行動、僅爲阻止渝軍調遷至雲南之南部、但在事實上日本正可乘機攻入內地、</p>

<p>閘北區內之房屋四百所曁其他資產、因原主於戰事發生之初、離去他往、乃經日軍當局管理、而今局勢大爲安定、而國際關係愈趨密切｜故上項房產、定於今日解除軍管理、正式由日當局移交市政府管理、此外尙有在日當局管理下時租戶所付之房金、其總數之三分之一、合計日金五十萬元、合儲券二百五十餘萬元、亦同時移交華方、衆信租界內之房屋及其他建築物之屬於同樣情形者、以後亦將逐步移交華方、此種移交、並不影響屋內之租戶、因以後房租、仍將由日僑民協會代華方當局按原租率收取、關於今日移交房屋所具之議定書、定於今晨十時在日海軍駐在官辦事處會議室簽署、日方由海軍駐在官簽字、華方簽字者則爲陳市長云、</p>

<h3>英美人心理突充　情願過集中營生活　興其冒險渡洋撤退返國　不如鎕居集中保障安全</h3>
<p>（報特寫）上海的英美等敵性國家的人民，將被帶入「集中營」的消息，自經本報首先刊登官方的證實後，在茶餘酒後增加了不少的談話資料。有的人說他們過去過分驕橫，盛氣凌人，而今物極必反，倒有屈爲階下囚的可能，眞是天道公正，大快人心。有的人對他們處境的突變，表示惋惜唏噓，世海滄桑，人事無常，無非給一般情世疾俗之徙製成許多發牢騷的把柄。</p>
<p>說起「集中營」，似乎「談虎色變」，人人自危。讀過詹凡丁（Jan　Valtin）的名小說「夜逝」（Out　of　the　Night）的人，一定會怨象到歐洲某國「集中營」內慘無人道的情形，好像是人間的活地獄，一進去就有死無生。不過這裏所說的「集中營」，英美人一部份已進去，一部份馬上就要進去的「集中營」，它的官方名稱是「人民集合所」（Civil　Assembly　Center）。又據日本大使館情報部長廣田說，英美人的集中祗是爲了「軍事需要」，並不是要給他們惡劣的待遇。</p>
<p>記得大東亞戰爭爆發後數天，有人問過一位日軍方面的發言人，上海的英美人是否將進集中營，答復是很巧妙的「上海本身就是一個大集中營，」那時誰都爲英美人稱慶，交戰國的僑民，還能保有相當的自由，後來這個「大集中營」縮小至酒樓·餐室·舞塲和戲院等以外的範圍，街上就多出一批臂上縛着紅布上面寫着「A」「B」或「X」的外國人。一般美洲黑色土人和一些素來被人當作無國籍或混血種的洋人，那時居然出於意料之外的在臂上圍了「A」或「B」的紅布，便驕傲地以優秀的民族自居，想不到能幾何時，紅臂章的人們會這樣快中消逝到「集中營」裏去。</p>
<p>一向英美人在上海的地位太崇高了，他們過着比仟何人都舒服都安適的生活。尤其在外匯緊縮的當兒，一元美余可十足掉換華幣三十餘元，况目那時物價並沒有現在高，賺金洋鈿，用華法幣，物質享受的滿足，誰及得上，一般銀行大班，洋行經理，旅館主人，股票商，地產商和公務人員等大發其財，他們住高貴洋房，坐流綫型汽車，吃珍美大菜，長得又白又胖，誰不羨慕，現在呢，房屋財產被軍管理，生財傢具貼上不可移動的封條，經濟來源全部枯竭，大餐館祗得過門大嚼，戲劇電影無法欣賞，甚至還要進集中營，好在他們過去享之太過，現在束緊腰帶，忍受一下，亦是應該　吧。</p>
<p>亦許他們中有人會埋怨命運多舛，爲什麽不在戰事發生前遵政府當局勸吿撤退，那是一九四〇年的事了，當時遠東風雲緊急，美政府運　鉅輪三艘來華撤僑，婦孺們和「不必要居住」的男子，乘機返國的不下三千餘人，後來英國亦步後塵，調度太古船隻戰大批僑民離滬赴印度，澳洲一帶。不過在那當口，英美兩國始終認爲一般足以使「國旗飄揚」的人士務須繼續留守，所以使領等外交官員，工商界金融界重要人物仍舊安居本位，迨大家認爲不會爆發的太平洋戰爭終究爆發，外交官員及知名之士先後以交換方式撤退，到現在還賸下的人就有進「集中營」的份兒。</p>
<p>事實上，一月九日南京政府向英美宣戰後，上海的英美人就準備了進「集中營」的情緒，雖然傳說紛紜，他們還是鎮靜如恒，有的還趕早整理行裝，如果有人問，「聽說你們將被集中了，」他們的回答往往是，「我們已經準備好，」態度非常堅定，當然誰亦不能否認，每一個人民應該充分地代表一國的國格，那種爲了國家，爲了保持國家的尊嚴而臨危不苟免的精神，是値得效法的。</p>
<p>他們究竟集中到什麽地方去呢，據說近在租界內和滬西，稍遠的在浦東·吳淞，最遠的在鎭江·揚州和杭州各地。大槪他們在指定集中日期前一星期先　到日總領事田尻的通令，按指定日期先赴指定地點集合，然後整隊開入預先定當的「集中營」去。私人用具·床褥·衣服·膳具及書籍等物都能帶入，但數量上以四隻小箱所能盛裝者爲限。原住之房屋和屋內之傢具，以後由日軍當局接管。</p>
<p>「集中營」內生活究竟如何，那是不很容易知道的，因為已進「集中營」的人不可能把內中情形洩露出來，未進「集中營」的人，不能享受先去參觀一下的權利。據說，在「集中營」內一切由集中者自己操作，伙食·洗衣·打掃·勞作等等，一槪自行料理。單身男子集中在一起，有眷屬的又在一起，無分老幼，一視同仁。又聽說滬西有一個「集中營，」是某大學原址，宿舍變成集中者的臥室，一間是男子四人，一間是女子四人，互相間隔，這大概是指已婚的，家屬雖可同在一營內，却不能同居一室。集中的工作在本月內可能全部結束，二十五日及二十八日就有兩批將分別入營。</p>
<p>最近曾問過一個美國人，「還有希望撤退嗎。」</p>
<p>「我不再想撤退，」他有興趣地說，「因爲與其橫渡大西洋冒潛艇　擊之危險撤退返國，寗願安全地留在這裏過集中營生活，好在戰爭終有結束的一日。</p>
<p>這是英美人心理的突變。</p>

<h3>改革民車賣票制度</h3>
<p>— 吳新民</p>
<p>電車賣票員揩油之風，近來似乎變本加厲，在公司方面當然是一筆鉅大漏巵，而乘客方面，往往姑息慫恿，不加糾正，致促成車票的漲價，結果，還是自身蒙受損失。爰特提出下列各項建議，希望當局澈底改革。</p>
<p>（一）廢除車上賣票制度，而代以在每一個車站上設立售票亭，乘客必須在站上先行售票。然後上車，在車上絕對沒有票賣，</p>
<p>（二）在每一等級的車門口，設一專使開啟車門的管理員，乘客下車必須把車票交付管理員撕毀。</p>
<p>（三）視可能情形，調整各站馴的地段和延長車站閒的距離，使每一個的站頭距離相等，以便容易管理而也能使票價與路途相等，絕對沒有那一站便宜，那一站吃虧的事。</p>
<p>（四）多發出月季票之類的優待券，因爲這樣也能幫助業務上不少的便利。</p>
<p>（五）對工作人員應視生活程度高低，酌量提高其待遇，以安生活，使他們不再想及舞弊，同時發覺舞弊行爲時，應從嚴處分，如停職等使其有所儆戒。</p>

<h3>當前的幾個問題　市府趙秘書長昨播講</h3>
<p>上海特田別市政府趙秘書長尊嶽、應上海廣播電台之請爲慶祝中國廣播協會二週紀念、於昨日下午七時三十分起蒞台演講、講題爲「當前的幾個問題」內容對人民應如伺協力大東亞戰爭、闡述頗詳、茲錄原詞如下、</p>
<p>今天是廣播電台協會二週年紀念、廣播恊會的成績、大家是曉得的、可是他的意議和精神、還値得提一下子、做今天說話的引子、</p>
<p>回想兩年以前、廣播協會方纔成立的時候、也正是國民政府還都不久以後、國民政府自從汪先生提創和平運動、以及一班人民熱誠擁護、以後經過相當的時間、方才達到還都的目的、可是那時節雖說還都、實在跟草創經營一樣的困難、我們初到首都的時候、斷宇頽垣、荒凉滿目、人民流離失所的情形、看看實在叫人感動、可是同時越發的鼓起了我們的勇氣、我們無論如何、必定要達到復興國家的目的、一切的艱苦困難、我們必定要加以克服、我們大家在主席領導之下、必定要完成我們的志願、如此一天一天、艱難固然不少、成積亦逐漸進步、即如廣播協會也是在還都以後不久成立的、自從廣播協會成立以後、試看各處電台的建設、一日千里、全國各地、不論地方的遠近、人民的多少、都可以相對一堂、簡直打破了時間空間的限制、非但可以得到政治的消息、正常的娛樂、還可以隨時聽領袖的訓話、提起自已的精神來、尤其主席最近曾訓示我們三點、就是維持治安、訓練民衆增加生產、値得我們的注意、</p>
<p>維持治安的問題。大家或者以爲這是軍警的事情、而不一定是每個個人的責任、可是大家要知道、治安如果得到每一個人民的努力、軍警就時半功倍了、現任軍警方面的力量、一般陸續增加、尤其是淸鄕區裏的工作、特別努力、可是這基礎在那裏呢、最重要的工作、還是在保甲、人民不能個個去當軍警、可是個個都編入保甲、保甲辦好、一舉一動、都有稽考、當然小而言之、匪徒不能够混進來、大而言之、什麼大規模的游匪、也不能够打村刦舍、所以我說、只要大家注意保甲，同時注意一切的異動、按照手續做去、這治安的維持、決定沒有問題、</p>
<p>訓練民衆這是最重要的事情、我們不單從學校裏去訓練、並且要從各方面做去、　校裏可以造就一個人的學問、然而一班人都要叫他成爲現代的良善公民、就不能叫學校去負起這個責任、主席自己兼任新國民運動會委員長、就是這個意思、國家須要學、者、更需要公民、尤其需要强健的國民、所以學校敎育是叫人學問、新國民運動是訓練人家做人、從小時候、參加靑年團做起、要從禮貌體格各方面做去、有　問的人、當然可以用其所長替國家負起責任來做事、可是一般國民、若都够不上公民的資格、那個國家也不是少數人所能維持得起來的、何况更是目前參加大東亞戰爭的時代、所以訓練民衆、絕對不是專負敎育專任、或者先生學生們的事、而是社會上一般人的事、無論如何、知道的人、應該對不知道的人、敎訓他會替國家養成一個良好的公民、實在就替國家盡了最大的責任、也就是　了復興中國的責任、</p>
<p>增加生產　增加生產這問題、或者有人以爲非大規模的工塲和幾千百萬畝田的集體農塲不能做、這話實在不對、要知道大規模的固然可以大量的增加生產、而少數人的、也未始不可以積少成多、我們應該知道從量的方面說、醫如織布大家每日多做一尺、所增加的生產就很可觀、就地區的方面說、種田種菜的人、如在河邊山坡多種一些、所增加的生產、更不知道多少、况且各　的自動的小規模增產、比較大規模的設備、簡單得多、成續可是一樣、古人有句駡人的話、叫「游手好閒、」這就是中國古代以來反對人　不治生產的意思、我們若是再來比較一下、農村的人民、實在是都在那裏努力工作增加生產、因爲他靠此為生、都市裏發財的機會多、都不肯做實事、這一點應當特別注意、引以爲戒的、進一步說、我們大家在主席領導建國之下、多知道我們應該從復興中華做到保衛東亞、這不但是中國的需要、也是中國的責任、尤其是日本對中國所希望是這樣、</p>
<p>治外法權　試看自從國府宜佈參戰以來、我們固然是以自動的立塲、來盡東亞一份子的費任、可是日本因爲我們已經參加戰爭共同站在一條戰綫的關係、所以也自動的宣布撤廢治外法權、和父還租界的兩大事項，大家要知道治外法權、是外國人拿他的法律在我國境內執行他自己人民的法律事項、在現在文明環境之下，關於法律、早已是屬地主主義、而不是屬人主義的了、所有一切屬人主義的存在、澈底說來可以算是文明人對於不文明人的一種辦法、因爲他們以為這裏的法律、是不滴用於文明人民的、可是我們中國的法律、要知道絕對是文明人民的法律、但是向來外國人因爲輕視中國、所以連中國法治的精神、都加以渺視、到得今天、還是不相信我們而採取屬人主義、事實上世界各國研究中國古代的法律、尤其是唐朝最完美的法律、已早成爲世界法學中的一個重要科目、可是他們因爲不重視中國的關係、連中國古代的文明、都只供給學術史上的研究、而不肯適用於現代、所以對於法權一項、始終不肯撤廢、可是日本却明瞭這一點、在我們大家都是大東亞共榮圈主人的地位、他自動的宣布撤廢治外法權了、原來日本硏究中國、比較英美來得入細、更加大家都是同一種族的關係、尊重中國和希望中國的理想、也不是英美的假面具可比、似以毅然決然的撤廢治外法權、這裏面實在已含好幾個意義、第一承認中國的法律是適合於現代的應用、第二承認中國已經够得上不需要採取法律上的屬人主義、第三證明我們大家都是大東亞的一份子、應該分工合作、共存共榮、我們接受了日本的好意、國民自然當更加興奮、格外努力去盡我們的責任、</p>
<p>交還租界之外、就要說到返還租界的問題、我們大家知道國境之內、有別國的租界、是最不合理的、尤其在一百年前、因爲打了敗仗、才留遺下這個租界來、更是國民所痛心的、兩國人民往來通商、本來是件相互的很平常的事情、爲什麽要專門闢出一地區來、不在這國家行政系統之下呢、我們一百年來的歷史、是遲早要加以淸算的、可是因爲帝國主義、爲便於榨取起見、所以以前無論邦交怎麽好的時候、都談不到這個問題、可是這回日本爲了尊重我們的國家、同時希望中國以自主的精神、來同盡建設大東亞的責任、所以毅然宜布返還租界、這種美意、當然是任何中國人民都是深切表示感謝的、可是租界有租界的壞處、固不待言、可也有租界好處、我們不必抹煞一切、物質上的設備、商業上的繁榮、和其他國際上的性質、我們並不是不歡迎外僑米住、也願意維持他們的設備性質和其他一切、尤其是一切設備正可供給我們的運用、只要我們去加緊運用、一切應該保存的地方、使城市中的人民得到安居樂業、更多的享受、是可以達到增加生產的效能、我們可要知道我們收回租界、不是單在法律上名義上收回、也不是單單收回洋房和馬路、就算完事、我們必定要於收回之後、努力去運用已成的基礎、要他辦得達到最合理想的都市、並且使他能發揮更大的效能、關於這一點、我想也一定人向此心、心同此理的、總之、我們做現代的人民、必定要盡現代的責任、要盡責任、必先要明瞭一切、要明瞭一切、又必定要時時加以注意、可是這却不一定是書本　上學得來的、就如廣播協會、可算爲公衆服務、簪大家注意一切的問題、這一點的功能、一面是簪國家維持政治、一面是替公衆效勞、値得感佩的地方、希望大家不要忽略、並且要隨時去儘量利用這個機會、同時我們大家更要祝頌廣播協會的事業發達、前途無量、要知道廣播協會的成功、就可以反映出中華民國的復興、</p>
<h3>運輸路途暢通無阻　本市燃料無慮缺乏　現有存量足夠充分應付</h3>
<p>因本埠各項食物以及日用品之積極增價、大通社記者昨特向本埠燃料業當局探問關於該業貨物之存量及運輸問題、茲將其所吿者、錄誌如下、</p>
<p>燃料運滬　源源不絕</p>
<p>本埠自去冬以來、煤斤運入、數量極多、目一般鄉民、自蘇州附近運滬之柴薪、亦源源不絕、故上海各區居民所需之燃料、並未發生絲毫不足之象、且本埠原有存量、依照去年初冬時預計、已足够充分應付本埠所需、因運輸路途之暢通、及存量之充沛、故於此百物漲價之際、燃料一項獨能屹然不動、</p>
<p>去冬消耗　大量減少</p>
<p>而據調查結果、本埠於去冬燃料之消耗、較往年反差、據云其原因乃係一般居民多能自行節省所致、最後又謂當局爲防免少數煤商、在此百物飛漲期間、作效顰舉動起貝、已對煤斤及柴薪之供給、嚴予統制、所以阻止囤積　縱及黑市之活動云、</p>

<h3>馬來亞縱橫談　（一）</h3>
<p>— 選民</p>
<p>（一）馬來亞地理形勢</p>
<p>舊英領馬來，北起北緯六　四十三分四十一秒，南至新加坡南端一度十五分四十三秒，東隔南中國海與婆雜洲相對，西南隔麻刺甲海峽與蘇門答臘北部對峙，北隔接壤地泰國而與緬甸相望。總面積達一三七·七七六·二七平方公里（五三·二一一·〇平方哩）。</p>
<p>馬來地面崎嶇多丘陵，中央有山脈縱貫，略偏於半島的西側。河流很短小，其中的霹義河和彭亨河較爲重要。但海岸多曲折，不少天然的良港。兩岸有蘇門答臘屛蔽，無甚風浪。東岸濱臨南中國海，當東北李候風起時，風濤不小。</p>
<p>馬來接近赤道，所以常年如夏，幸有海風調劑，並不十分酷熱。雨量很多，幾乎每隔一天，就下雨，雨後即凉爽如秋，暑氣盡消，所以有「四時如夏，一雨成秋」的俗諺。</p>
<p>馬來人口，據一九三九年年底推定，共爲五百三十九萬六千七百零六人。其中最特出的現象是我們華僑的人口，佔馬來總人口中的最大多數，共計二百三十萬零三百五十三人。以經營商業和鑛業爲主，尤以經營橡膠業和採錫的爲最多。其次是馬來人，印度人，日僑也不少。以外是歐洲人，爪哇人，安南人，泰國人，菲律賓人，和歐亞混血種人。馬來人多從事農業勞動，印度人多從事橡樹栽植。歐洲人中以英人占最多數，掌握政治和經濟的大權，爲馬來的統治者和剝削者。</p>
<p>馬來人口的膨脹率很高，最近三十年間幾乎已增加兩倍，主要的原因是由於橡膠及錫產業之急激的發展，引致了對馬來移民的增加。比較下列爲表，便可以看出近年人口增加的情形：</p>
<p>（一）馬來人口增加之形勢（單位一千人）</p>
<p>（二）馬來人口增加之形勢（單位一千人）</p>
<p>（註）（一）包含聖誕島及可可斯島，（二）包含布洛賓市，威爾期利及天定；（三）調查時尙有不定居人一，四九六人。</p>
<p>（三）一九三九年馬來民族別人口統計</p>
<p>（面積一平方公哩人口一人）</p>
<p>（密度爲每平方公哩之人數。）</p>
<p>（二）列強侵略史要</p>
<p>舊英屬馬來嚴密的說，一爲海峽殖民地，包含新加坡島，檳榔嶼，麻六甲等；二爲馬來聯邦州，包含霹靂，雪蘭峨，森美蘭，彭亨等四州，三爲馬來非聯邦州，由柔佛，吉打，吉連丹，玻璃市（加決）丁加奴等各州構成，以及婆羅洲的薩拉瓦克（沙撈越），布羅民（渤泥），來比恩納開島、，英屬北婆羅洲，可可斯島（一名克林島），聖誕島等英國屬島。不過英國的行政區劃，實際上總稱海峽殖民地，聯邦州，非聯邦州三者爲馬來亞。</p>
<p>歷史上，很古時代就有關於馬來的紀載。遠在西歷紀元前三百年，繼亞力山大王爲埃及王的浦特蘭彌優，據傳就已知道馬來的錫產·九世紀的阿拉伯歷史書籍中更有關於馬來西岸之克　錫產的紀載，這所謂一克立」，實爲今日之吉打。其實如果仔細杳考中國古籍，則關於馬來的古代歷史紀載，也許還要詳盡。</p>
<p>新加坡島的開闢，遠在八百年前，那時蘇門答臘的人民首赴該島，披荊斬棘，歷二百年，漸爲各方所共知。後來受爪哇的麥加毘德王的侵略，該島又荒廢成一漁村，居民却遷往北方的麻六甲從事建設的後來麻六甲就因此爲海上交通要衝而成爲馬來半島的中心地。</p>
<p>白人最首發現馬來也就是麻六甲。白人最先至東方的葡人伽瑪（Vasco　de　Gama）於一五〇二年率艦二十艘，二次至印度，與印度王公極意聯歡，得在若干地方　立商業基地。一五〇三年葡人阿爾布歸克（Affomso　d`Albugurepue）在印度鞏固基地，為印度「總督」，後更　錫蘭而至麻六甲，加以佔領，在這裏設立商館，爲向東進窺的根據地。當時還沒有橡膠，也沒有石油與錫，歐洲人所追求的是南　特產的香料，所以，當時北循陸路越天山以至中國以取絲的　路，叫做「絲綢之路」，而南越麻六甲出南海以取南洋香料的路就稱為香料之路，所以，馬來半島一有白人踪跡，就開始了被侵掠的　運。</p>
<p>葡萄牙人佔領麻六甲約有一世紀之久，至一六四一年爲荷蘭人所奪取。荷蘭佔領麻六甲也有一世紀，至一八二四年，英人以蘇門答臘退還給荷蘭，即換取麻六甲。不過，英國已先於一七八六年由東印度公司向吉打的蘇丹以年額六千元之費，取得檳榔嶼，在那裏建設制覇南洋的根據地。當時殖民活動大都集注在貿易交通上要點的爭奪目標爲保持港市，而馬來半島使成爲西方列强分割佔領的棋盤。不過英國以產業革命後的進步力的增强，在馬來的形勢也特別優裕。牠除了換取了麻六甲之外，又以海盜的故技，在南洋掠取土地，如檳榔對岸的威萊士里，及彭古爾島，史姆比倫島等，以及强取以爲自己的保護國，如雪闡峨等，有時更强迫的獲得自由買易權，以扶値其勢力，利用機會，漸使馬來半島全部都淪入英帝國的支配之下，於是到二十世紀初，形成了所謂海峽殖民地，而以霹靂，雪蘭峨，森美蘭，及彭古爾四州組織聯邦，而在其他非聯邦州，則山英籍顧問」掌握其實際的統制權。這樣統治馬來，約及一百五十年，直到大東亞戰爭開始，始爲日軍所逐出，結束了英帝國獨佔馬來天產與榨取住民的血淚史。</p>
<h3>促進衛生事業前途　當局推行衛生工作　各項衛生宣傳運動均告見效　盼望居民共同負責進行不懈</h3>

<p>取締馬路　里弄污物</p>
<p>衛生處當局對於前述各項運動、宣傳結果、均告見效、據表示、此為上海公共衛生事業前途之光明、並謂嗣後除對於業經宣傳之各項衛生事業、督飭居民共同負責進行勿懈之外、其他如馬路菓皮之狼籍、里弄間垃圾之露積、低窪地面之死水等、亦均將加以取締、一方面令飭負責淸除事務之小工（即淸道夫）或工頭、加緊工作外、並盼居民各自注意、</p>
<p>派員複查　不潔居戶</p>
<p>至於居民自身之住屋、衛生當局今後亦將予以相當之注意、衛生處於首屆禁止隨地吐痰運動期間、曾派員分赴各人烟稠密之較小里巷實行調查、並勸令戶長負責整理並淸除戶內一切、據悉、衛生處於最期間、又將派遣原調查員赴各戶舉行複查云、</p>

<h3>小銀行錢莊與保險公司　當局考慮合併辦法　具體方案尚未正式決定</h3>
<p>本市自太平洋戰事發生後，因遊資充塞，金融事業，突呈畸形發展之現象，銀行，錢莊，保險公司等之開設，去年一年中如雨後春筍，不可勝數。其後財部當避為嚴密管理金融機關，特明令規定限制金融機關之創設，自今年起除特准者外，一概不得新設。但今春以來，新銀行之開業者已有十三家，新銀號錢莊之　業者已有十二家，正在籌備開業中者，銀行有十家左右，錢莊有八家左右，此項新設之銀行錢莊，其註冊手續已早經辦妥，故不在財部命令限制以內，但商業社記者探悉，有關當局應於新創銀行錢莊及保險公司過多對於本市金融，或將發生不良影響，實有將小銀行錢莊及保險公司實行合併之必要，現正由有關方面縝密研究具體方案，一俟辦法決定。可能正式見諸明令，惟尙須經過相當時期云。</p>
<p>經濟評言</p>
<h3>民間經濟界的願望</h3>
<p>一年來上海經濟界之演變，極瑰麗之大觀，而新興之企業，尤呈空前之局面，値此統制經濟正在推行之時代，在企業家自身方面，固應認淸所處的四周環境，適應時代的趨勢，以經營穩健之　業，而臻於合理化之地位。同時政府方面，應念推行此計劃經濟政策時得不到民間的協力，往往事倍功半，不易奏效，以是　後政府的責任，亦有數端：</p>
<p>第一，在儘量擴大其服務範圍，以補助民間企業之不逮，凡交通事業，公共工程，均應努力建設，澈底改善，如美國之國家資源處，英國之國家統制事業委員會，意大利之合作委員會等皆是。</p>
<p>第二，企業之協助，如日本之工業合理化局，丹麥之促進生產委員會，爲政府對於技術方面有力之協助，又如美國之建設金融公司，德意志比利時之再貼現與擔保局，爲政府財務與金融協助之特點。</p>
<p>第三爲保護公衆，增進商業道德，促進工業安全，以保證經濟制度之完整。如歐洲日本對商標商品之質的統計，美國對公平競爭及誠實廣吿之規定，以及對於市塲之嚴密管理，皆爲政府實行統制經濟時分內之工作。</p>
<p>以上三端，希望上下協作，在同一目標之下，脚踏實地，努力邁進，一面爲有效的合理生產，一面公平的合理處置，例如華商股票公開交易，在目前戰時經濟之要求下，自有從速確立正式市塲之必要，企望當局根據當地環境，參酌各國成規，召集工商界有聲望之代表，共同討論正式股票市塲之建立；同時，責成其領導股票業組織正式公會，遵照法令，從事於華股正當之經營，藉使工商事業，得凶正常之華股交易，而獲得資金之靈活生產之發展，其幸何如。</p>
<p>自另一方面言，戰時的民間經濟界自當了解當前的情勢，認淸所處的地位，各自從本位上努力，爲分工合作，安分守已的經營。尤須各方聯絡內外溝通，盈虛酌劑，應付得宜，彷彿如常山之蛇，節節相應，又如身之使臂，臂之使指，絕無脫節缺失的弊病。則中國新興企業界，雖値任何困難環境之中，亦必穩固其地位，展拓其業務，而屹然立於顚撲不破之境地。</p>

<h3>中日經濟協議會　卽將舉行首次會議</h3>
<p>中日民間經濟界人士，爲加强中日經濟提携起見，曾於去秋籌組中日經濟協議會，但因他種關係，遷延迄今，最近國府參戰後，中日民間經濟人士，愈有加強提携之必要，是以不日即將舉行首次會議，聞屆時出席者為日方商工會議所青木主席，武內常務理事等十八名，華方市商會袁理事長等有力經濟人十餘名。將以參戰後之新事態爲原則，交換中日經濟提携之意見云。（二十三日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>匈牙利試騐從暖窒內　生產茶與咖啡</h3>
<p>匈牙利京城二月廿一日海通社電：匈牙利正在試騐利用溫泉建造暖窒，生產茶與咖啡。現由杜尙敎授領導是項試騐工作，並由政府當局予以種種協助云。</p>
<h3>油糖計口配給　準一二實施　數已商妥惟尙待核准</h3>

<h3>已入健康狀態之　菲律濱經濟生活</h3>
<p>馬尼拉二月二十一日同盟社電稱：一年來在日本軍管理下之菲律濱經濟生活，無論在工業與農業方面，均已臻於健唐狀態。日軍自佔領菲島以後，即從經濟自給之遠大計劃上着手促進菲律濱之生產事業。最近食糧之生產，已見增加，食糧之價格，已歸劃一。此外運輸事業已告恢復製造，工廠次第復工。其尤堪稱道者，厥爲大量之款項，多用以購買晨村間之剩餘產物—尤以糖爲大宗—藉以調劑農村金融。此外復利用日本之農業技術，以增進菲律濱之米產，因米爲菲律濱人之主要食糧。</p>
<p>此外如棉花，酒精，肥皂，菜油之類，均委由菲人自種自製自給。自給而外，更得以多餘之原料，供給日本國內之工業製造。以菲島天然富源之富，加以日本農業技術之優，其前途正有未可限量者。</p>
<h3>上海橡皮工業之猛晉　橡皮鞋爲主要製造品</h3>
<p>上海新興工業中之嶄然露頭角奢，當推橡皮用品製造業橡皮工業在上海工業歷史上雖非悠久，但在目前上海工業上所佔地位，甚爲重要，自可靠方面調查，目前上海橡皮工廠，在開工生產中者，約佔百分之六十左右，而橡皮工業之前途，可自左列各種現象中窺得其未來發展之程度：</p>
<p>（一）上海與南洋各地貿易，正在恢復中，此項連繫，一經恢復以後，則橡皮原料，可以圓滑，並且繼續不斷輸入上海，以供此間各橡皮工廠製造之需。須知近年來上海橡皮工業之不景氣狀况，均以橡皮原料缺乏爲其主因。</p>
<p>（二）上海旣爲東亞工商業之中心，此間所製橡皮用品，將以供給中國其他各地以及東亞其他各國。上海工商業恢復正常發展以後，各處對於上海製造之橡皮用品，必有更廣泛之需求。</p>
<p>（三）經濟狀况之改變，使橡皮用途增加不少，例如此間當局聞不准再用皮革製鞋，則惟一之代替品，即爲橡皮鞋，其次則爲輪胎，因目前上海盛行自由車，故輪胎一項，亦足促進橡皮工業之猛進。</p>
<p>至於此間橡皮工廠所製造之物品中，估計其中百分之七十爲橡皮鞋，百分之十五爲輪胎，其餘百分之十五爲各種日用品，包括玩具在內。</p>
<h3>公債求售方殷　—成交極少—</h3>
<p>公債行市，昨又繼續趨疲，蓋以人心稍有忐忑，求售較多。丙種初做爲七元左右，小至六元內，見五元七角低價，後又升至七元，交易極稀。丁種约二元左右，戊種約三元五角至三元，成交極少，餘則大都無市。</p>
<h3>豆餅現貨步跌　期貨呈保持局面</h3>
<p>昨日豆餅市况，現貨在統制聲中步趨下挫，比前軋跌三四元。期貨則以多空雙方互相僵持，形成盤旋局面。計開：元隆豆餅三車，價爲一百十七元至一百十五元，靑中餅五百片，價八十五元，惠山餅二月份交一千片，價一百十七元，利字餅二三大交二千片，價一百十七元二角半至一百十七元半，姓記餅二月底交二千片，價一百十九元至一百十八元八角，姓記及利字餅三月份交二千片，價一百十八元半至一百十九元，上海廠餅二三月份交二千片，價一百十九元至一百二十元，肥字餅一二禮拜交二車，價一百二十元〇五角至一百二十元。又聞雜糧組之平賣餅五萬片，將變更交解辦法，藉以免除當局查究。</p>
<h3>燭皂漲無止境　囤戶還在拉進</h3>
<p>日用品市面，仍不脫堅勢，因各貨站在最高峯，一般新囤還要進者，此致各貨漲勢漫無止境。如固本皂昨喊高至一千元新高價，白祥茂皂九百四十元，黃祥茂八百八十元，剪刀皂九百六十元，比上日再昂十元。鳳風牌火柴五千五百元，美麗牌五千七百元，金鼎牌四千三百元，什牌三千元。白禮氏洋燭六百五十元，僧帽脾五百四十元，什牌四百元，一致上升仍勁。</p>
<h3>中日著名銀行　將舉行懇談會</h3>
<p>據聞中日兩方有力銀行爲適應國府參戰後之新情勞，加强中日銀行之提携起見，即將由華方金城，中國，交通等各大銀行與日方正金，朝鮮，臺灣，三井等銀行舉行懇談會。按大東亞戰爭發生後，華方各銀行雖已同向中日合作之途推進，但各方之經濟情勢，尙未達到完全提之境界。查去年份中日兩方銀行交換存款額。日方銀行存於華方銀行之存飲總額計有〇〇萬元（儲備銀行在外）華方銀行存於日方六大銀行之存款總額，亦有〇〇萬元，雙方差額相等，等於無來往之狀態，導入華方民族資本之工作，極爲困難，但國府參戰之後，一切貿易配給，與收買等等，中日兩方均處於同一條件之下，是以中國金融界所負擔之範圍亦廣，意即與日方銀行界之接觸擴大，有加强中日金融提携與合作之必要。（二十三日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>最近上海各種工業進展之程度　以開工活動之機器百分率爲標準</h3>
<p>茲自上海工業界可靠方面調查，上海各種工業，截至一九四三年一月底爲止，所有機器　開工活動中者，以百分率爲標準，有如下列表格：</p>
<p>各種工業類　機器活動之百分率</p>
<p>染織……百分之三十</p>
<p>五金……百分之五</p>
<p>電氣……百分之六十</p>
<p>紡織……百分之六十五</p>
<p>化學……百分之八十</p>
<p>印刷……百分之八十</p>
<p>皮革……百分之四十五</p>
<p>機械……百分之三十</p>
<p>釀酒……百分之一百</p>
<p>菸草……百分之一百</p>
<p>麪粉……百分一百</p>
<p>橡皮……百分之六十</p>
<p>自上列表格以觀，上海各種工業廠家之機器，在開工活動中者，平均由百分之三十至白分之八十，可見上海工業狀態，已有顯著之進步，尤以食品工業爲最。菸草一項，亦露頭角，無怪菸草商無不獲致巨利，而各菸草公司—如南洋華成—之股票價格，亦均繼長增高焉。</p>
<h3>上海木炭聯合會　派員調查各地木炭生產</h3>
<p>上海木炭聯合會，上週曾在割木炭生產辦法，俾可防止木炭之黑市，但生產事項，須愼重檢討，特於二十二日在日本俱樂部舉行理事會，結果決定由林理事長等率領調查隊，分赴杭州，蕪湖，長安，湖州，嘉興，寗波，紹興，鎮江，海門等　實地調查。</p>
<h3>家庭藥品　無大上落</h3>
<p>家常樂品市面，尙趨寗靜，做價無大上落。計：頭痛粉四十七元，八卦丹五十元〇五角，萬金油五十八元，鷓鴣菜八十六元，龍虎人丹四十七元，較前價格頗甚相仿。</p>
<h3>香煙實銷不振　市價穩中帶疲</h3>
<p>香烟市面，欲漲乏力，蓋客銷懈怠不振，再以搬運困難，本銷因供給尙覺平衡，而鮮進胃。故價總呈穩靜，甚少上落。計：大英牌一萬二千九百元，老刀牌一萬〇六百五十元，品海牌八千四百元，仙女牌八千四百元，五華牌七千四百元，日烟金槍牌三千四百元，金大樓四千三百元，紅玫瑰二千八百五十元，全祿牌四千元，念校三千五百元，指南脾三千四百元，國烟金字塔七千九百五十元，美麗牌七千一百五十元，金鼠脾四千四百元，白金龍四千七百五十元，均較上日價穩疲互見云。</p>
<h3>黑白椒均喊緊</h3>
<p>黑椒近以有人吸收，市勢復緊。但成交數　不多，聊以點綴市面，昨日劃盤比前約升百分之五。均爲一號椒，價格黑大略退，白椒亦略形叫升，市象堅挺。</p>
<h3>金山枝成本貴</h3>
<p>金山枝據號方消息，產價以匯水關係，合劃成本較申市爲高，故來源有暫稀之象，查申市籌碼尙多，故一時不易升至產價水準。但市勢較緊，實　　應有之現象。</p>
<h3>華中火柴公司　定期成立</h3>
<p>華中火柴公司，業已籌備就緒，不日召開第三次發起人會，屆時通過章程及出資關係，推選理監事，再行定期召開成立大會，至於第三次發起人會之日期，侯中支那振興會社伴野淸民返任後決定，成立大會约在三月上旬舉行云。（二十三日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>市區本月二次食米　卽將開糶　每人配給二升</h3>
<p>市區本月份中旬食米，業經市食糧管理局全部配給竣事，分別通知各公糶處繳款出米，是以一二日內，市區即將普遍開糶，每人每旬仍規定二升授給，聞三次公糶食米，或將每旬遞增至二升半，使市區食米之配給益臻充裕云。</p>
<h3>中國的暴發戶與物價</h3>
<p>在日本有一句話叫做「成金」，相當於中國的「暴富人家」的意思，上海，蘇州一帶，就把它叫做「暴發戶」。</p>
<p>日本對於這「暴發戶」一語，含有輕視的意思，中國亦然，把「暴發戶」看做下賤。但是「暴發戶」本人的心理狀態，因爲中日的國情不同，顯然有了兩樣的地方。日本的「暴發戶」非常謹愼，極力避免人家叫他是暴發戶，所以眞正成了暴發戶，也不肯露出暴發戶的馬脚。</p>
<p>但是中國的暴發戶，沒有這種心理；不想避免人家去說他是暴發戶。因爲犯了這種毛病，就被人家傳揚是暴發戶，親戚朋友碰到了，也就要向他捐款，或者硬借，往往還要碰着綁票，結果犧牲巨款，這是他們最大的痛苦。這樣一來，等到他們　想避免暴發戶這句話，可是聲名四播，已經弄到不得不承認的地步，沒有辦法，祇好僱起保鑣，來預防危險，可是招勢愈大，他的暴發戶聲名也愈大，反而叫大家知道了他是暴發戶。他們對外非常吝惜，可是私生活眞不是否人想得到的，享盡一切奢華，中國方面成爲暴發戶的種類不多，大都是投機致富的，所以他們對於投機的心理很强，事實上他們那種投機心理，照我們日本人的眼光看起來，簡直是粗暴，然而他們或許也有其大道理存在。還是說他們「膽壯」較爲適當吧！他們用極少數的資金，一經投機成功，就是巨富。他們得了這許多現金，當然要想出路到物資頭上，考慮到物價問題，假使保存現金不用，而物價步高，豈非是損失嗎？所以，就動腦筋去囤貨，不論什麽都好，只要手裏有現貨，就不愁有何損失。所以囤積貨物的人，不肯脫手，假使照現在的市價賣出，雖然賺錢，可是換來的現金，補不進同量的物品，所以祇收不放，才不曾有何損失，大體這兩種心理，就是投機致富的根源，現在上海物價的所以高漲，可以說是被這種「投機致富」心理所促成。我相信這種見解是不錯的吧</p>
<p>在理論上來使暴發戶的心理改變，是調整物價，加强戰力的方策之一，希望中國的執政者考慮及此才好。（雲鵬：譯自月二十三日大陸新報栗本寅治原作）</p>

<h3>「明中云」和「暗中來」</h3>
<p>— 雋灝</p>
<p>乞丐逢到向人求乞的時候，時常有「明中去，暗中來」的一句口頭語。</p>
<p>其實，我認爲這句說話自有它的不妥之處。試想：施捨錢財救人飢寒本來是一種仗義慷慨的善舉。不過有些慈善家，每逢施捨解囊以後，是不大願意讓自己的名聲，給人家知道的。換句話說：假使爲了希望要人家稱讚他樂善好施，才願意解囊　將的話，就有點那個。由此說來，「明中去」三字，的確是不妥之至了。</p>
<p>至於「暗中來」呢，那益發不對了。試想：錢財這件東西，怎麼可以從暗中去求得呢？凡是不給坦白地吿訴人家而所得的錢財，不是悖人之財，　是非禮之財或不義之財。如果正大光明地用了一分辛苦而求得的一分錢財，那也儘可以一絲不隱地吿訴人家，何必要偷偷摸摸地在暗中搜求呢？</p>
<p>所以「明中去，暗中來」這一句話，應該要變爲「明中來，暗中去」才對。</p>
<h3>星期日挨餓記</h3>
<p>— 摩</p>
<p>自從有戶口米分配以後，學校當局除將晚餐以食稀飯业滲以山芋以外，最近又有一條新規定，每逢星期日中午不開飯，原因是同學們可以回到親戚朋友家去飽餐，這本來是件兩全其美的事。在學校方面可以節省開支，在學生方面可以藉此機會吃一頓美肴。（雖然物價騰貴，家庭的食物總比學校進步得多了）</p>
<p>起初我聽見這消息心中一驚，因爲找跑出學校門就沒有地方去，所以對於受親戚朋友的冷臉這一層我是可以高枕無憂的，不過自己的經濟又不十分寬浴，坐小館子當然談不到，經過長期考慮，我想所好一星期只一次，假若不吃，餓着肚子一個月也只有四次，一年不過四十八次，却也是小哉乎也，大致不會影響身體健康吧？遂立定主張每逢星期日中午不吃飯。</p>
<p>星期天早晨吃稀飯時想到中午沒有飯吃，因之比平時多吃一碗，大約一碗稀飯可以支持兩個半小時不餓那麼，我能吃四碗半稀飯就可以支持到下午，中飯不吃又有會麽關係呢？可是吃了三碗，再想吃實在喝不下了。雖然，明知等一會兒一定會餓，可是肚中實在不能再容納了。</p>
<p>經騐吿訴我，凡是工作過度的人，容易感到飢餓，所以我吃完稀飯，除從飯堂中爬了幾層樓梯走到寢室中坐着，就儘力避免身體活動，同寢室的人很多，我除自己看看書以外再和她們撩天，時間在熱鬧中總是過得很快的，牠消逝在人們不知覺中我一點也沒有腹飢的感覺。</p>
<p>噹噹……一陣敎堂報午刻的鐘聲傳進我的耳膜，我還是很鎭靜的坐着，同學們却紛紛地走了，他們到外面去享受這美麗的星期日。</p>
<p>房裏只剩我一人了，空虛的境界中反映得我自己肚中異樣的空洞，匆忙地拿起一本論語就子曰詩云的哼起來，學而篇還沒有讀完，大空昏沈沈的却下起雨來了，如果，我是個詩人，我一定會對這迷濠細雨發揮一下我的靈感，可惜我不是，我也慶幸我不是。</p>
<p>隨着雨聲而起的是腹內嘰哩咕嚕的喧鬧，臀實在讀不下去了！怔視着外邊的雨滴，我輕柔地安慰着我的肚子，你看，外邊不是下着麽？沒有爾傘和雨鞋又怎可以出去呢？像這雨淋淋的天坐在家中，不是頂舒服的麽？她們一定淋得像落湯鷄了。</p>
<p>我的精神安慰並不能發生效力，事實牠所需要的是物質接濟，在我精神與心理作用過多之下，牠那鹿鳴又一陳陣地較前更烈的發出來。</p>
<p>我丢下論語拿起孟子就讀從孟子見梁惠王一口氣讀到「老者衣帛食肉，黎民不飢不　，不王者未之有也」，我的心中得到無上安慰，孟老夫子不是吿訴了我們嗎，要到年紀老的時候才可以衣帛食肉，要是黎民才可以不飢不寒，可見得廿幾歲的靑年舉生應該挨餓的了，但是如果有人問我，爲什麽馬路上有七八十歲的求乞呢？我想他也許是討帛衣肉食吧，或者，他還是個小孩子不够老吧？</p>
<h3>苦和樂</h3>
<p>— 滸敏</p>
<p>苦和樂與儉和奢一樣，似乎並無顯著的界限。</p>
<p>窮苦的人，坐了輛黄包車代步，就算是奢；富裕的人坐了，却算作儉，因爲坐黄包車的代價，在窮人的總支出裏，是一筆可觀的款項；在富人的支出項裏，却是一個微小的數目。</p>
<p>苦和樂也是這樣，假設一個身無分文，饔飱皆愁的窮措大，有人給了他幾十塊錢，他心裏就快樂了。同樣的，一個用慣大錢的富人，假使手裏只剩了這麽幾塊錢，就會覺得難以維生，極度困苦了。</p>
<p>所以，只有快樂，沒有痛苦生活的人，他就不知道快樂　。</p>
<p>因爲苦和樂，有着這樣的特性，所以有些人，在痛苦裏生活，而不知道痛苦。要是不然的話，那末，人總是喜歡享福的，快樂的，那個獃子喜歡熬着痛苦呢。</p>
<p>有人說，我曾經看見過有些人，並沒有什麼可以喜欣的事，光臨到他們身上。爲什麼他們甘受痛苦呢？</p>
<p>是的，世界上的確有這種人的，唯有這種人，才可以被人稱崇的。因爲他們能够在絕對的痛苦裏，找出些兒快樂。把這些兒快樂，來忘記他們頑固的痛苦。</p>
<p>但他們的快樂，並不是爲了知足，爲了神經反常。因爲知足了，神經反常了，會失去他們寳貴的前途，眞正的快樂的。</p>
<p>他們共同的相信着，快樂一定會隨在痛苦之後，出現的。而且，牠的來臨，好像是定期的，到了某一個時期，牠自然地會降臨的。即使他們享受不到，他們的子子孫孫，一定能够享受到的。</p>
<p>可是，相反的，有一種人以爲他們在那裏「痴子望天坍」。那種理論，那種幻想，永遠是理論，是幻想，並無一綫實現的希室。</p>
<p>因之，他們從的確難忍的痛苦裏，進入了只有眼前快樂，而沒有前途的漩渦裏。有些人更因爲鑽不進這個漩渦，而同室操戈了，謀殺直系親屬了。這批人，才是天生成的可憐蟲，永遠得不着眞正的，永久的快樂。</p>
<p>還有些人，因爲熬久了痛苦的生活，等不及快樂的來臨而怨恨了。</p>
<p>淸苦的生活越過得長久，到將來所得的快樂，也越久長</p>
<p>我們在小說裏，在歷史上，也可以找出一大批人，他們在年靑的時候，過着淸苦的生活，到後來會形成一個有財產，有地位的人。</p>
<p>徜使，他們不知道以淸苦來鼓勵自己，改進自己，而一味怨天尤地，趨炎附勢。他們那會有這樣榮譽，這樣快樂的一日。</p>
<p>許多年老的，有聲望的先生們，也曾對我們說過：一切眞實的學問，知識，經騐，在窮苦的時候得到的，比快樂時也可說是富裕時，所得到的，更廣博，更切實。</p>
<p>所以，讓我們將這烽火遍地，民不聊生的痛苦時期，當作鼓勵我們，改進我們的唯一機會；一面，在這痛苦的時期裏，放樂觀些。以大無畏的精神，來創造將來永久的快樂，綿長的幸福！</p>

<p>「這是一架風琴，先生—一架影戲院的風琴。」</p>

<h3>誠實</h3>
<p>— 景泰</p>
<p>在這個爾詐我虞的社會上，我們所見識到的人事一切，大多是披着一件欺騙的外衣的。而一般人的習性，又是那麼易於說虛僞的話，行虛僞的事。因之令人感到這個毋界太醜惡了。</p>
<p>人，或者至多祇能對少數的知心親友誠實；之外，那就得凶時因地而以虛偽和欺騙的手段來應付了。不過，無論如何，一個人若是誠實的，總能獲得人的奪重和歡喜；反之，那就要惹人的憶厭和輕視。</p>
<p>誠實，實在是人的至寳。人因爲誠實，縱然生活貧苦，職位卑微，而他那一種人格美却永遠輝耀着，使人對之敬服。</p>
<p>誠實的定義怎樣來下呢？比如有一個醫生對一個已無生望的病人說：『你快死了。』這話妥當嗎？假使醫生是這樣對人說：『你的病快好了，你安心靜養吧。』那，我們能爲了醫生說這不誠實的話來非議他嗎？當然，在人的常情上，我們都造成醫生用後面的這個方法云安慰病人的吧。在錯綜複雜的人事社會上，諸如此類的事不勝枚舉；所以誠實的較適當的解釋是：由於善意的動機爲原則，而表現的方法不是絕對的。</p>
<p>希臘名哲蘇格拉底，因爲他爲人誠實，俗人却議嘲他是瘋子。但是，數千年來，一直有人在頌讚和渴慕這誠實的瘋子呢！</p>
<p>誠實眞是生命中最美好的寳貝。</p>
<p>萬籟寂時，我們撫心自問吧：對人對己，不論在言語上，行爲上，思想上，信仰上，我們都誠實呢？抑是不？（摘錄二月十四日靑年會顧政書先生演講）</p>

<h3>Commentary on Price Control Measures and Wartime Economy</h3>
<p>The relationship between price issues and the wartime economy is of utmost importance and need not be elaborated upon. However, specific solutions require experts to contribute their strengths and work together to achieve a reasonable resolution to the price problem. Therefore, we are providing detailed opinions and methods from the technical perspective of price control measures. It would be a blessing for the nation and its people if relevant parties could pay more attention and find even more comprehensive and appropriate solutions. Because the more thoroughly research and discussion are conducted at the beginning of implementing price controls, and the more meticulously plans are made, the faster and greater the success can be achieved, and the less inconvenience the people will experience. As long as price controls are implemented effectively and by capable personnel, the commonly worried problems such as the prevalence of black markets, the hiding of goods, and the reduction of production sources can be gradually reduced. However, to thoroughly implement the price control policy and stabilize prices, various other wartime economic policies must be coordinated and promoted to achieve significant results gradually. Because the price problem is inherently closely connected to all national economic measures and social dynamics. Price is a whole, and price control is just one aspect of the overall price control strategy. Therefore, the solution to the price problem must be achieved through the complete implementation of the entire price control strategy. Furthermore, the entire price control strategy is part of the overall national wartime economic policy, so it is necessary to coordinate the entire price control strategy with other wartime policies to achieve complete and satisfactory results. Comprehensive price control is the initial step in wartime economic control. It is necessary to further adopt mutually supportive economic and financial policies, such as comprehensive control of materials, development of production enterprises, economical consumption by officials and civilians during wartime, improvement of transportation, tightening of government budgets and currency, control of the financial sector, adjustment of taxes, and strict national organization. The government and relevant parties must immediately conduct research and discussion based on the actual situation and needs since the declaration of war, formulate implementation measures, and diligently promote them to achieve practical results. Among these, increasing production and saving consumption are the most urgent measures at present, and should be the focus of future price control strategies and must be implemented first.</p>
<p>The main element in the price control strategy is to increase wartime production; and wartime production is centered on agriculture, industry, and mining. It is hoped that the government will formulate detailed plans to increase production based on the outline of wartime economic policies and increase funding to promote wartime production. The key points of increasing production must be based on reality, focusing on goods necessary for the nation during wartime and for the people's daily lives. The increased production of materials should be prioritized in terms of variety, quantity, timing, and region, to meet urgent needs, supplement shortages, act according to capabilities, save time, labor, and capital, and fully meet the actual needs of wartime. For example, in terms of agricultural and forestry construction, in the agricultural sector, in addition to increasing grain production, equal importance should be given to cotton production, while rapeseed, silk, sugar cane, and tobacco should also be taken into consideration to ensure that the people's needs for food and clothing are met, and the nation has the necessary materials for wartime. In the forestry sector, in addition to general forest protection and construction of new forests, special attention should be paid to the new methods of logging timber for shipbuilding, to develop the shipbuilding industry and restore shipping along the Yangtze River, coastal areas, and inland rivers, to facilitate the regulation of materials in various regions in the future. Attention should also be given to the widespread cultivation of firewood and charcoal to supplement the shortage of fuel during wartime, which would benefit industry and transportation. In the livestock sector, in addition to improving the breeding of draft cattle and horses, attention should also be paid to the promotion of livestock and poultry such as pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks, and fish farming, to supplement the national food supply, and to utilize their by-products to develop handicrafts. Furthermore, in terms of industrial production, for the needs of wartime, the scope of state-owned industries should naturally be expanded, but given the special circumstances in China's industrial history, enterprises under government supervision and private management may be more suitable for actual needs and achieve greater results. At the same time, the most important thing that should not be ignored is the support for small and medium-sized industries, and efforts should be made to promote and encourage handicrafts and household industries. The living standards of our general public are not high, and the products of handicrafts and household industries can solve the shortage of daily necessities for the majority of the people. Moreover, these products can also be used as raw materials for large industries and wartime military industries. However, increasing production should not only be promoted through government orders, but must also be assisted and protected in all aspects, such as the opening or increasing of agricultural and industrial loans in finance, the implementation of increased production loans, water conservancy loans, promotion loans, marketing loans, rural sideline loans, land finance loans, and so on. Protection should be provided in terms of politics, law, and transportation. We firmly believe that only by increasing production can we solve the price problem and promote the price control policy to achieve practical results.</p>
<p>At the same time, the following aspects of the price control strategy cannot be ignored: First, the conservation of consumption. Whether it is the government or the private sector, all organizations and even personal lives should regard saving capital, saving time, saving materials, and even saving manpower as the primary task during wartime. The policy of "streamlining troops" and "simplifying government" must be implemented at the top, and the extravagant habits of urban areas must be thoroughly eliminated at the bottom. Waste should be regarded as a crime, and extravagance should be regarded as an enemy. Then materials can be secured, and manpower can be concentrated. Second, facilitating transportation. The unification of transportation operations and the simplification of inspection agencies are the primary tasks for facilitating transportation. As for adjusting transportation organizations, improving transportation tools, utilizing existing private transportation equipment, repairing general roads, improving traffic management methods, facilitating the exchange of passengers and goods, and ensuring the convenience and safety of private material transportation, these are all what the authorities are currently urgently expected to do. Third, the government should make efforts to tighten currency and budget on the one hand, and adjust tax laws and control finance on the other. These four measures should be implemented simultaneously and complement each other, which is the main task of wartime economic policy, and also the only way to ensure the smooth completion of the price control strategy. If other solutions are sought instead of this, then no one can expect the full effect of any price control policy, even the increase in production. If the government has determination and courage, and the people can abide by the law and work hard, then not only the price problem, but also the realization of the entire wartime economic policy outline will not be a problem.</p>
<p>Finally, we can summarize the opinions and methods of the price control strategy and highlight its main points: that is, if we make our best efforts today to limit prices to a reasonable stability, then producers can increase production according to the outline and plan because the cost of production is relatively stable, without having to worry about some major losses in the future; consumers can have relative peace of mind psychologically and will not universally compete for goods and waste materials. Relatively scarce items will also not be completely controlled by a small number of people, and hoarders will reduce hoarding because there are no large profits to be made. Public and private transportation enterprises can develop in a situation where costs and expenses are relatively stable, and financial expenditures will not be expanded indefinitely due to soaring prices; the public can gradually restore and enhance their confidence in currency due to stable prices; and there will be significant assistance in the promotion of savings or government bond policies to be held in the future. On the other hand, actively increasing production, improving transportation to facilitate the flow of goods, and conserving consumption will lead to a balance between supply and demand in the market, and the price control policy will be easier to implement. At the same time, actively absorb large amounts of floating capital in society to reduce the major pressure of implementing price control policies; strengthen and tighten social organization, and improve institutions to assist in the promotion of price control policies. We especially hope that the relevant authorities will especially consider the hardships of the business community and the general public, and must take utmost efforts to reduce the suffering of the people as the main point. At the same time, we expect the business community to endure temporary inconveniences, that is, to sacrifice some profits, and cooperate with the government to implement policies to seek a reasonable solution together. We firmly believe that as long as the upper and lower levels empathize with the difficulties of the times and cooperate in implementation, the future success is undoubtedly assured.</p>

<h3>On Preparations for Non-Retreat and Decisive Battle</h3>
<p>The German authorities announced that German forces retreated from Rostov and Voroshilovgrad on the night of the 14th. Rostov is a must-contend place for controlling the Don River area, the Caucasus, and the Volga area, and Voroshilov is also an important strategic location in the eastern part of the Donets. However, in the current German-Soviet war situation, what should be emphasized is not the fight for one city or one place, but the overall situation of the decisive battle posture in the future.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why the Red Army was able to take a positive offensive in this winter war. The most important reason is that in the German army's summer offensive last year, the Red Army adopted a retreat strategy. As a result, the German army lost the opportunity to encircle and annihilate the Red Army. Therefore, in this winter war, the Red Army's strength is much better than in the previous winter war.</p>
<p>From the current situation, we can know that the German army believes that instead of adhering to the gains and losses of one city or one place, it is more appropriate to look at the overall situation of the German-Soviet decisive battle and come up with the most advantageous strategy.</p>
<p>The scale of the European war is expanding day by day, so how the total war progresses in the future is more worthy of attention than the advance and retreat of local fronts. Germany is now determined to use the total strength of the country to launch another offensive against the Soviet Union, and it is said that it has great confidence in the preparation of food, military supplies, human resources, and domestic rectification, which is in line with the expectations of the Axis powers.</p>
<p>Moreover, from the above point of view, in this winter war, the German army's consumption will be limited to the minimum. Here, we cannot but pay serious attention to it. (Xiang: Translated from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on February 16)</p>
<h3>French Government Announces Decision to Return Concessions in China and Renounce Extraterritorial Rights Implementation Upon Resolution of Relevant Issues</h3>
<p>Vichy, 23rd (Havas) - An official announcement this morning stated that, in order to strengthen friendly relations between China and France, France has decided to renounce its judicial privileges in China and its administrative rights in the Legation Quarter in Beijing, the Shanghai International Settlement, Kulangsu, and the French Concessions in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou. The French government will immediately announce the implementation of this decision once all the issues involved have been resolved.</p>
<p>Vichy, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The French Information Department today issued the following statement regarding France's revocation of extraterritorial rights and return of concessions in China: The French government, in order to enhance friendly relations between China and France, has decided to abolish its judicial privileges in China and return the administrative rights of the Legation Quarter in Beijing, the International Settlement in Shanghai and Kulangsu, and the French Concessions in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou. However, in view of the various difficult issues that will arise simultaneously when giving up these rights, the government will quickly implement the decision announced this time as soon as all issues have been resolved and within the scope of possibility.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The Propaganda Department issued a statement at 6:00 PM on the 23rd, quoting the original text of the Vichy dispatch as follows: "The French government's statement on the revocation of extraterritorial rights and the return of concessions in China: In order to strengthen friendly relations between China and France, France has decided to revoke extraterritorial rights in China and renounce the administrative rights of the Legation Quarter in Dongjiaominxiang, Beijing, the Shanghai International Settlement, the Kulangsu International Settlement in Fuzhou, and the concessions in Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and Guangzhou. The French government is prepared to implement and announce this decision at the earliest possible time after the relevant issues have been resolved."</p>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - After receiving instructions from his government, French Consul in Nanjing, Celat, visited Zhang, the Minister of European and American Affairs, at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 10:00 AM on the 23rd, and delivered the French government's statement on the revocation of extraterritorial rights and concessions in China.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - On January 9, the day China entered the war, the Japanese government concluded an agreement with the National Government to return concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights. Both sides established a processing committee to discuss the details of implementation, and the various matters of return and abolition are proceeding rapidly. After the Sino-Japanese agreement was concluded, the Italian government immediately announced the abolition of extraterritorial rights and the return of concessions in China. This time, France, understanding the National Government's position and the situation in East Asia, resolutely returned the administrative rights of the concessions and international settlements in China to the National Government, and abolished judicial privileges in China. The National Government expressed deep gratitude to the French government for its friendly measures, and also expressed gratitude to the Japanese government for its mediation between China and France. At this point, China's century-long hope of recovering the concessions has in fact been fully achieved. It has been less than three years since the National Government returned to the capital, but its diplomatic policy has been successful, and China's international status has also been elevated. At the same time, it has had a great impact on Chongqing.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Chu's Statement</p>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Regarding France's statement on returning concessions in China and abolishing extraterritorial rights, Foreign Minister Chu specifically issued the following statement: "Since our government declared war on Britain and the United States on January 8 this year from a position of independence and autonomy, it has gained the sympathy and assistance of friendly countries. Therefore, one hour after the declaration of war, our friendly nation, Japan, signed a joint declaration with our country to jointly complete the war, and also signed an agreement to return concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights. The Italian government also issued a declaration on January 14 to return concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights. This kind of genuine and friendly proof is truly epoch-making and historical, and makes our government and people very excited and grateful. Sino-French relations have always been cordial. I have stayed in France for a long time and have great sympathy for France. I am also very concerned about and understand the difficulties France has encountered in recent years. The current situation of France is caused by the deception and destruction of Britain and the United States. It is well known to the world that China's concessions and extraterritorial rights originated from British and American imperialism. Now that all countries have declared the return of concessions in China and the abolition of extraterritorial rights, it is unbearable for the Chinese people to see France alone retain this kind of remnant of British and American imperialism. It also affects France's national honor and prestige. Fortunately, the wise authorities in France, with foresight, have resolutely and automatically formally declared the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. From now on, the world in East Asia will be clear and bright, and the relationship between China and France will definitely be more friendly. I am deeply gratified and hope that other countries will follow suit."</p>
<p>Japanese Minister Good Fortune's Remarks</p>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Japanese Embassy Information Minister Good Fortune issued a statement at 7:00 PM on the 23rd, "Today, the 23rd, the French ambassador visited the Minister of European and American Affairs of the National Government and announced that France is willing to voluntarily give up all its privileges in China. This is truly an epoch-making fact in the history of Chinese diplomacy and can be said to be a great success of the National Government's diplomacy. Japan takes mutual cooperation and the liberation of Asia as its fundamental diplomatic policy to cooperate in building a new China. Based on this policy, it took the lead among all countries on January 9 this year to abolish extraterritorial rights and return exclusive concessions. Following this, its ally, Italy, also took the same measures as Japan. This time, France will also return all its privileges in China to China, which is truly gratifying. In the past, when Britain and the United States saw that Japan had abolished extraterritorial rights and returned concessions in China, they were greatly embarrassed and made the same statement to Chongqing three days later as Japan. However, France's measures this time are completely different in nature from those of Britain and the United States, because Britain and the United States only shamelessly returned what had already been occupied by Japan, which is empty talk and of no practical use. On the contrary, France is truly giving up its own privileges. France is a country with important interests in Japan's presence in China, and its exclusive concessions are located in Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and other places. This time, in order to take a common step in its policy towards Japan, it is cooperating to restore China's complete sovereignty, which is a great contribution to the national independence and liberation of both China and Japan. We express our full respect for this."</p>

<h3>Results of Japanese Air Force in New Hebrides Islands One Enemy Destroyer Sunk</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 5:00 PM on the 23rd that the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force bombed Espiritu Santo Island in the New Hebrides Islands on the night of February 21, fiercely bombing enemy ships at anchor and various military facilities. One enemy destroyer was bombed and sunk, another was hit and caught fire, and the facilities on the island were severely damaged. We suffered no damage.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Since this year, the Japanese Navy has been operating in the South Pacific, constantly inflicting heavy blows on the enemy. It has also bombed the New Hebrides Islands. The island is located 600 nautical miles south of the Solomon Islands and is within the enemy's air force range. The Japanese elite air force first attacked Espiritu Santo Island, an important point on the island, on January 20, fiercely bombing the airfield, causing fires in four places. On the 22nd, it bombed the airfield again, causing fires in six places. On the 26th, it made a third fierce bombing, causing fires in three places at the airfield. On February 21, it made a fourth fierce attack on the island. Japanese planes braved fierce defensive artillery fire and fiercely bombed enemy ships at anchor. One enemy destroyer was hit and sunk, another caught fire, and the enemy's land military facilities were severely damaged. The Japanese planes launched four air raids on the island, all at night. Although the enemy's defensive artillery fire was very fierce, the Japanese planes suffered no losses in all four raids and returned safely to their original defenses. Moreover, when Espiritu Santo Island was first fiercely attacked on January 20, US Navy Secretary Knox happened to be staying on the island to inspect the South Pacific front. At that time, he fled in a panic and narrowly escaped. The Japanese Navy Air Force has been active in the South Pacific, inflicting great material and psychological damage on the United States and Australia. The New Hebrides Islands, which were fiercely bombed by Japanese planes this time, are a major link between the United States and Australia and a major supply base. The Japanese planes fiercely attacked the island to cut off the sea supply line of the enemy forces on Guadalcanal Island, putting them in a major crisis. The approximately 30,000 remaining US troops under Bachi on Guadalcanal Island are now on the verge of collapse.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Melbourne, the Allied Commander in the Southwest Pacific announced on the 22nd that the Japanese Air Force had bombed Milne Bay and Buna on the 21st.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Washington, the US Navy Department announced on the 22nd that a fighter plane had not yet returned after a US Navy Air Force attempted to bomb New Georgia Island on the 21st.</p>
<h3>German Forces Advance on Three Routes: Tebessa Threatened; British Eighth Army Moves Toward Mareth Line</h3>
<p>Rome, February 23rd, Huitong News Agency: Today's Italian military communique states that over the past four days, Axis forces in Tunisia captured 845 enemy soldiers, seized or destroyed 66 tanks, 74 armored vehicles, 58 artillery pieces, and countless other war materials. Yesterday, five enemy aircraft were shot down over the Strait of Sicily and Tunisia. Near Milos Island, enemy aircraft attacked our convoy, with two fighters and two torpedo planes shot down. Palermo and its suburbs were bombed last night, resulting in 6 civilian deaths and 6 injuries. Two enemy aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft fire, and one was shot down by our night fighters. Additionally, two enemy aircraft were shot down over Pantelleria Island, and one enemy aircraft was shot down over Catanzaro.</p>
<p>Tangier, February 23rd, Huitong News Agency: General Eisenhower's headquarters issued a statement saying that German forces are advancing on three routes. One route is advancing north through the Kasserine Pass, reaching a point six kilometers south of Thala, which is the gateway to the plains behind the British First Army's line of defense, approximately eight kilometers from the crucial railway connecting Tebessa and northern Tunisia. Rommel is advancing with elite troops. The British tanks, artillery, and infantry retreating from the Kasserine Pass have suffered considerable losses. The Axis forces advancing west toward Tebessa are crossing the Algerian border.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, February 23rd, Huitong News Agency: The Gothenburg Commercial Shipping News reports that British military experts are deeply concerned about developments in Tunisia. It is reported that the German offensive is aimed at Tebessa, which has been threatened by recent German victories. If Tebessa falls into German hands, cooperation between the British First and Eighth Armies will be in danger of being cut off. In that case, even if the British Eighth Army's offensive on the Mareth Line succeeds, it will be futile. This German victory will have a significant impact on other battlefields and future wars, as the Allies repeatedly suffer setbacks, delaying the invasion of Europe, and the Soviet Union's offensive power may gradually diminish during this period.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, February 23rd, Huitong News Agency: According to the latest news from the front in London, the Kasserine Pass, the gateway to the Allied base in Thala, has been occupied by Axis forces. German infantry and tank units are currently engaged in fierce battles with British and American tank units in central Tunisia. The Kasserine Pass is located northwest of the town of Kasserine, approximately thirteen kilometers away. Since the town was occupied by Axis forces last week, Allied forces have retreated to new positions. The German forces took advantage of their victory to advance into this narrow pass, only four kilometers wide and about ten kilometers deep, with two roads and one railway running through it. The Axis forces now control two railways in central and southern Tunisia, and a third railway is also threatened by the Axis advance. It is reported that the British Eighth Army is moving towards the Mareth Line front, approximately thirty-five kilometers from the main Axis position.</p>
<p>Battle for the Atlas Mountains Imminent</p>
<p>Berlin, February 23rd, Huitong News Agency: Authoritative sources here declare that after the successful localized operations of German tank units in central Tunisia, they have taken advantage of their victory to advance and have now defeated the American forces operating there. The battle for the Atlas Mountains is about to begin. Yesterday, American forces had another 40 tanks destroyed by our forces.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, February 22nd, Havas News Agency: According to the latest news from Rome and Berlin, Axis forces in Tunisia are advancing steadily. British and American sources acknowledge that American forces are continuing to retreat in southern Tunisia. Today, the main Axis forces advanced in central Tunisia. According to Italian military reports, they have occupied several British and American positions. Every transportation line and troop concentration point has been repeatedly attacked by the Axis air force. Berlin announced that a large number of British troops, including tanks, had been annihilated north of Tebessa. This news has been confirmed by the North African Allied Forces Command's communiqué. It is reported that British forces have committed their armored divisions to attacking "danger points," where German forces are fiercely attacking positions 40 miles from the Allied base at Tebessa. After occupying the Kasserine Pass, the German advance continued. A column of General Montgomery's British Eighth Army continues to advance from Médenine towards the strong Axis defenses of the Mareth Line. Heavy rains are falling in central Tunisia. According to Allied sources, the main armored forces, artillery, and infantry of both the Axis and British/American forces are concentrated near the northern Tunisian coast. A major battle is more likely to occur in this area than in the south. The Moroccan wireless station announced that Axis forces are attacking fiercely northwest of Kasserine, south of Sbiba, and behind Metdjéz el Bab. Allied forces are currently making every effort to block them.</p>
<h3>Kouang-Tchéou-Wan: Public Security Restored in the City; Residents Cooperate, Creating a New Atmosphere</h3>
<p>Kouang-Tchéou-Wan, Xiying, February 23rd, Central News Agency: During the Japanese army's entry into the French concession in Kouang-Tchéou-Wan, they had obtained the full understanding of the French beforehand. The Chongqing side did not anticipate that the Japanese army would land there, so they did not build adequate military facilities in the area. However, this place was a crucial point on the Chongqing side's last remaining smuggling route, so the blow it suffered was profound, and its embarrassing situation was difficult to conceal. The various situations seen here differ from those seen during previous battles. For example, residents near the Kouang-Tchéou-Wan concession would temporarily enter the French concession in Xiying to take refuge upon hearing gunfire from the Xuwen direction. The military and political organs belonging to the Chongqing side had already fled without a trace. After the Japanese army entered, public security was restored, and the general refugees, following the Japanese side's advice, returned one after another. It is learned that the Chongqing side's various organs escaped into the interior on the night of the 17th. The Chongqing side's newspapers in Chikan, such as the Daguang Bao and Liyan Bao, had already moved to the Yulin area beforehand. Both newspapers have ceased publication since the 17th. Currently, no Chongqing side newspapers can be seen in the entire Kouang-Tchéou-Wan area. Furthermore, Commandant Trémoulet seemed to have sensed the Japanese army's intention to enter beforehand, so he issued a special notice advising the people not to act rashly and to be cautious in their actions. The leaflets issued by the Japanese army upon entering have now achieved results, so the residents are adopting a cooperative attitude. Also, when news of the Japanese army's commencement of operations was heard, food prices soared, but after the situation calmed down shortly after the Japanese army entered, they began to decline. The general overseas Chinese are fully cooperating with the Japanese side, so the Kouang-Tchéou-Wan area is now full of a new atmosphere.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, February 22nd, Central News Agency: Kouang-Tchéou-Wan used to be a stronghold for Chongqing's special operations. This time, due to the entry of the Japanese army, its gloom has been swept away, and it has returned to its original state. Looking back at the Chongqing side's use of Kouang-Tchéou-Wan as a base for plotting, the facts are as follows: After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and the impending fall of Hong Kong, the Chongqing side selected Kouang-Tchéou-Wan as a base for so-called special operations, dispatching a large number of personnel to infiltrate the area and engage in clandestine activities. The area then resembled pre-war Hong Kong. The Chongqing side also mobilized various conspiracy organizations, such as the CC Clique, to expand its sabotage work, focusing on the following points: (1) Disrupting public security in the Japanese-occupied areas; (2) Enticing promising overseas Chinese; (3) Monitoring anti-Chongqing personnel, etc., engaging in covert activities. Furthermore, due to the increasing military importance of Guilin, the forward base of the US Air Force in Chongqing, the Chongqing side's intelligence-gathering activities based in Kouang-Tchéou-Wan also became increasingly active. It is learned that recently, CC Clique leaders Dai Li and Chen Su have arrived in Guilin to manipulate the special operations in Kouang-Tchéou-Wan, and a plan to establish air bases in Kouang-Tchéou-Wan and various parts of the Leizhou Peninsula is also being carried out in secret. Last July, the 7th War Zone's Leizhou Border Area Defense Command was established to strengthen defenses in that area, intending to actively start activities towards Hainan Island. However, due to this preemptive entry by the Japanese army, the Chongqing side's special operations have now been completely crushed.</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Assist in Landing Operations</p>
<p>Japanese Army Base in South China, February 23rd, Central News Agency: In order to assist the Japanese army in launching landing operations on the Leizhou Peninsula, the Japanese naval air force has been searching for Chongqing's military strongholds in that area and Chongqing's ships sailing at sea over the past few days, thoroughly bombing them and achieving great results. On one day, a naval bomber squadron suddenly attacked Meilu in Wuchuan on the north bank of Kouang-Tchéou-Wan, fiercely bombing the Chongqing army that was plotting to act, and nearby military facilities were also destroyed. The next day, it drove a long distance to attack the Jiuzhou River estuary on the western shore of the Leizhou Peninsula, fiercely bombing the military facilities there and crushing the Chongqing shipping fleet stationed there. Afterwards, on a certain day, it searched for the Chongqing army in the Wuchuan area and discovered several motorized sailboats fully loaded with soldiers four kilometers north of the area on the sea. It immediately dive-bombed them. Another unit sank all of the Chongqing army's hundred-ton motorized vessels and sailing fleets, etc., on the southwest sea of the Leizhou Peninsula. On a certain day, it also bombed the Chongqing military facilities in the Beihai area (northwest of the Leizhou Peninsula, along the Tokyo Bay coast), scoring another victory. During the Japanese air force's repeated sorties, no counterattacks were seen from the Chongqing army.</p>
<p>Course of the Japanese Entry into Kouang-Tchéou-Wan</p>
<p>Tokyo News Agency, 3rd, Central News Agency: According to a telegram from a naval reporting team member on a certain Japanese warship, a Japanese warship first anchored off Xiying in Kouang-Tchéou-Wan at 2:10 AM on a certain morning. At 2:30 PM, the Kouang-Tchéou-Wan Commandant Trémoulet visited the Japanese army commander on the warship. The Japanese army commander landed at 4:00 PM to return the visit at Commandant Trémoulet's residence. From 11:00 AM on the 20th, the Japanese plenipotentiary began to negotiate the Japanese army's entry into Kouang-Tchéou-Wan with Commandant Trémoulet at his residence. At 12:10 PM, a complete agreement was reached and took effect immediately. Thereupon, the commander of the Japanese army corps advancing on the Leizhou Peninsula arrived at Xiying at 5:00 PM that afternoon. At 5:10 PM, he boarded the warship to visit the Japanese naval commander, shook hands, and spoke happily. At 3:00 PM on the 21st, the Japanese marines, in accordance with the spirit of the Japanese-Vietnamese joint defense agreement, landed at the Xiying wharf to garrison Kouang-Tchéou-Wan in order to defend Kouang-Tchéou-Wan. The French and Annamese soldiers were lined up in the square in front of the wharf to welcome the Japanese army. The people witnessed the scene of the Japanese and Vietnamese armies rejoicing together, and all were deeply pleased. The Japanese marines held a parade in the city of Xiying, and residents along the way hung Japanese flags to show their welcome.</p>

<h3>Spokesperson of the Japanese Expeditionary Force to China Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Nanjing, February 23rd, Central News Agency: The spokesperson of the Japanese Expeditionary Force to China issued a statement on the 23rd, stating that since the beginning of this year, the Japanese Expeditionary Force to China has overcome severe cold and continued to carry out operations in various parts of North and Central China. In particular, since mid-February, the Japanese army in Central China has begun spring offensive operations in two directions and is currently making active progress. One of these two operations is the operation to eliminate the Chongqing army's Lu-Su War Zone in northern Jiangsu, and the other is the operation to eliminate the Chongqing 6th and 2nd War Zones in the areas surrounding Wuhan. The results of these operations are gradually expanding. At the same time, elite Japanese troops, with the close assistance of the naval forces, are carrying out landing operations on the Leizhou Peninsula in South China and have further entered the areas surrounding Kouang-Tchéou-Wan in the French concession. This time, when the Japanese army entered, the Chongqing army imitated the old tricks of the British and Americans and attempted to infringe upon French rights and interests. Now, the Chongqing army near Guangzhou is moving south, attempting to act rashly. The Japanese and Vietnamese sides, based on the principle of Japanese-Vietnamese garrison, with complete agreement on both sides, are carrying out preemptive strikes. Its significance in terms of operations and economy is extremely significant. These operations can be said to be divine punishment for the Chongqing side, which is willing to be a traitor to East Asia. Looking back, since the National Government participated in the war, the Chinese army has assisted the Japanese army in fighting side by side, launching fierce attacks on the Chongqing bandits who are traitors to the construction of a new China. Recently, the Chongqing army's will to fight is clearly low. This can be clearly seen from the recent operations in various places. In various battlefields, the number of Chongqing army prisoners and surrendering soldiers is increasing day by day, showing the progress of the Greater East Asia War. Under this situation, the Chongqing side has great expectations for the activities of the US Air Force in Chongqing, and seems to be attempting to counterattack with air guerrilla warfare. The Japanese air force in China is determined to destroy them, so currently all enemy aircraft are lurking. The Japanese Expeditionary Force to China, with the strengthening and expansion of the National Government's political power, is increasingly exerting the original features of its operations and is determined to eliminate the British and American air forces and promote the collapse of the Chongqing side.</p>
<h3>Results of the Battle for Bailizhou: Japanese Army's Results</h3>
<p>Nanjing, February 23rd, Central News Agency: According to a telegram from a certain Japanese army base on the 23rd, after a certain unit of the Japanese army occupied Bailizhou, downstream of Yichang, on the 17th of this month, it formed a favorable posture against the Chongqing army in the 6th War Zone. Chen Cheng, the commander of that war zone, in order to regain the strategically important Bailizhou, attacked that place with 500 men from the 16th Division on the morning of the 19th. After the Japanese army's counterattack, all were annihilated. In another direction, a separate detachment of the Japanese army that landed on the island is currently preparing to attack a certain unit of the Chongqing army. Up to the present time, the Japanese army's overall results are: 1,160 Chongqing army soldiers killed, 200 captured. The Japanese army seized 18 light machine guns, 300 rifles, 688 landmines, 150 hand grenades, and 500 boats.</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Compete for Air Supremacy</h3>
<p>(Special Telegram from Kato, Berlin, 15th) According to the latest information obtained in Berlin, the conflict between Britain and the United States regarding control of air routes is gradually becoming public. The United States' ambition to overthrow Britain from the world stage, and Britain's desperate struggle in decline, can be seen in this.</p>
<p>A few days ago, in the British House of Lords, former Air Minister Lord Londonderry questioned the government authorities, saying:</p>
<p>"The rise and fall of a nation's power depends on its citizens establishing civil aviation routes widely around the world. Regarding this issue, cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union is needed. The United States has secured 25 percent of the world's aviation rights. What countermeasures does the government have against this established fact?"</p>
<p>In response, Under-Secretary of State for Air Balfour represented the government and replied:</p>
<p>"The government is currently studying this issue and hopes to reach an agreement with the United States if necessary. Unfortunately, Britain is currently exerting all its efforts to engage in war, so there is neither time nor resources to open up civil aviation routes."</p>
<p>The United States' attempt to produce aircraft is not focused on war purposes but is intended to defeat all commercial enemies in order to monopolize world post-war trade, and therefore contains self-interested elements. The above answer reveals dissatisfaction with the United States.</p>
<p>The discussion of the "World Aviation Routes" issue has been raging between Britain and the United States for several weeks. From all aspects, the United States is plotting a monopoly. As Vice President Wallace said: "The construction of global aviation routes is of paramount importance, and only this can ensure world peace." The United States believes that airplanes that can connect continents with continents in a few hours must be built, and claims that "the freedom of the air" in the future has the same meaning as "the freedom of the seas" in the past. The United States has secured Iceland and a large part of the British tea plantation in the Caribbean Sea, and has also occupied Germany's former air routes in South America. The United States is expanding to North Africa and Cyrenaica from these bases. Therefore, as The Times argues, it is only natural that Britain is suffering because these bases give the United States absolute rights to use post-war aviation routes. In fact, British newspapers are filled with news that because the United States' desire to occupy military bases is insatiable, Britain will completely lose its own aviation routes, clearly indicating the threat from the United States.</p>
<p>Regarding the above-mentioned discussions in the British House of Lords, news commentators unanimously expressed dissatisfaction with the government's statement. The Daily Mail pointed out the tremendous power of the United States' transport aircraft production and said, "The government's attitude is ambiguous." The Daily Telegraph argued that "the United States has a monopoly on the production of military and civil transport aircraft. The government should immediately negotiate with the United States on this issue."</p>
<p>In other words, the United States is solely responsible for the production of transport aircraft and bombers that can be used on air routes, while Britain is producing fighters that are of no use on air routes.</p>

<h3>Overview of French Concessions in China</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) – As France simultaneously recognized the National Government and announced the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China, as well as the return of concessions in various locations, a brief account of the situation of French concessions in China is provided below. (Shanghai) According to the Sino-French agreement of April 2, 1849, the area south of the British concession and north of Shanghai city, along the Huangpu River, was designated as the French concession. The initially designated concession area was only 944 mu. Subsequently, on October 29, 1861, it was expanded to the Huangpu River area of Shanghai city, increasing the area to 1,122 mu. On January 27, 1900, it was further expanded westward by 912 mu. At the same time, the 114 mu under French de facto control before 1849 was also formally recognized. Later, on July 20, 1914, it was further expanded westward by 13,002 mu. As of today, the total area of the French concession in Shanghai is 15,150 mu. (Tianjin) The Tianjin concession was established in 1861 and expanded in 1900. It bordered the British concession to the southeast, extended to the Weishi Canal in the west, adjoined the Japanese concession to the northwest, and reached the Baihe River estuary to the northeast, with a total area of 2,360 mu. (Guangzhou Shamian) Shamian, the foreign residential area of Guangzhou, faces the Pearl River in the southwestern corner of Guangzhou. It was originally a sandbar, which was filled in over three years starting in 1839 to form a small oval island. The French concession occupied eleven acres in the eastern part of the island, accounting for one-fifth of the entire island's area. (Hankou) Established in June 1896 and expanded to its current size in 1902. The concession faces the Yangtze River, opposite the former German concession, south of the Japanese concession, and north of the former Russian concession, covering an area of approximately 492.82 acres.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Regarding the period, area, and administrative organization of French concessions in various parts of China, details are as follows: Tianjin concession period: 1806, area approximately 2,300 mu, administrative organization: French Concession Council, with ten members elected in 1934, including seven French and three Chinese. Hankou concession period: 1858, opened in 1896, developed in 1900, expanded area 360 mu, administrative organization: Municipal Council. Guangzhou Shamian concession period: opened in 1861, area 54 mu, administrative organization: Council, with seven council members. Shanghai concession period: 1844, opened in 1899, expanded area 14,900 mu in 1914, administrative organization: French Municipal Council. Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The establishment of extraterritorial rights by foreign countries within Chinese territory began with the Sino-British Five Ports Trade Regulations of 1843. France obtained this privilege based on the Huangpu Treaty of 1844. As of June 1939, fifteen countries enjoyed extraterritorial rights, including Japan, Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, Norway, Brazil, Italy, Belgium, Portugal, Spain, Peru, Denmark, Sweden, and Switzerland. Currently, Japan announced its abolition on January 9th of this year, and Italy declared the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights on January 14th of this year. Now, France has also announced its abolition, which has significant implications for the independence and integrity of our national sovereignty. Furthermore, the Shanghai French concession established the Mixed Court within its jurisdiction on April 20, 1829. In the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), China established the Second Special District Court and the High Branch Court in the French concession. After the National Government moved back to the capital, it officially took over the two courts on November 8, 1940, and has been in charge since then.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Military Mission Arrives in London</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to a report from London, the Chongqing military mission led by Xiong Shihui arrived in London by plane from Washington on the 22nd. It is reported that they plan to stay in London for several weeks to hold talks with the British government and military leaders.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to a report from London, the British government announced on the 22nd that the former British Ambassador to Chongqing, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, had returned home to report on his duties and had consulted with the national government. Now that his mission is complete, he recently boarded a plane to Chongqing to resume his post.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Washington, the Chongqing Foreign Minister, T.V. Soong, arrived in Washington on the 22nd. It is reported that this trip, as in the past year, he plans to stay in Washington as the chairman of the aid-to-Chongqing agency.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Convenes Diplomatic Conference</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Havas) – Washington dispatch: President Roosevelt suddenly convened a diplomatic conference last night, attended by Secretary of State Hull, Undersecretary of State Welles, the President's Special Envoy to the Vatican, Mr. Taylor, Professor Bowman, an American territorial issues expert who participated in the Versailles Peace Conference, and Mr. Pasvolsky, Commissioner for Post-War Reconstruction. Washington officials revealed that the discussions at this meeting were related to general post-war issues.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Havas) – Yesterday was Washington's Birthday. President Roosevelt gave a twelve-minute radio address to the nation, warning the people not to believe that victory was already in hand, as the Allied countries would face more misfortunes in the future.</p>
<h3>Commander of Italian Air Force in Eastern Europe Missing</h3>
<p>Rome, 23rd (Havas) – Lieutenant General Betti, the commander of the Italian Air Force in Eastern Europe, ventured deep into enemy territory in an attempt to rescue Italian troops trapped in an encirclement. His fate remains unknown. A doctor who accompanied him on the plane is also missing. Betti had previously rescued Italian troops in distress on several occasions. In addition to transporting food and military supplies, he had also rescued wounded soldiers, and his achievements were remarkable. This time, the chances of survival are slim, and those who heard the news were deeply concerned.</p>
<h3>Turkey Schedules Presidential Election for March 8th; Current Prime Minister Still Expected to be Commissioned to Form Cabinet</h3>
<p>Ankara, 23rd (Havas) – Turkey will hold a presidential election on March 8th, but it is only a formality. The newly formed Grand National Assembly of Turkey has already confirmed that President İsmet İnönü will be re-elected. According to the Turkish Constitution, the President's term of office is the same as the term of each new parliament. Therefore, a presidential election must be held when the new parliament is established. After the election, the cabinet must also resign as usual. However, it is widely believed that Saraçoğlu will still be commissioned to form a new cabinet and continue to serve as Foreign Minister. Political figures here expect that the Minister of Interior in the new cabinet will be appointed to Kırdağ, and the Minister of Economy will be taken over by Çayrum, the manager of the Sumer Bank. It is also learned that the new National Assembly will meet on March 15th to discuss the budget.</p>
<p>Ankara, 23rd (Havas) – Turkish newspapers commented yesterday that Turkish Prime Minister Saraçoğlu's radio address on Sunday reiterated Turkey's neutrality. In his speech, he indirectly denied rumors that Turkey would conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union. He stated that the existing old treaty between the Soviet Union and Turkey would continue to be effective in maintaining neighborly friendship.</p>
<h3>Sketch of Macau</h3>
<p>(Special Correspondent Ishikawa in Macau, 14th) A port of opium adorned with cosmetics, perfume, and the voices of nightingales—Macau, known as the Monte Carlo of the East, is no longer a place for entertainment amidst the raging waves of the Greater East Asia War. Odd! Even!—The expressions of the Macanese people entrusting their fate to the dice, the hearts of the dancing girls embracing and dancing wildly to the jazz music of the end-of-century revelry, despite the darkness of the streets due to power conservation and the distress caused by soaring prices and insufficient supplies, they still reluctantly cling to the beautiful dreams of the past. This is the current expression of the Macanese people, presenting the diverse appearances of a neutral country.</p>
<p>The only neutral zone remaining in the Far East, bordering Zhongshan County, a region of peace, and separated from the Chongqing jurisdiction by only a narrow strip of water, linking Europe and the Far East, Macau, the Lisbon of the East, will have a multifaceted new character from an Eastern perspective.</p>
<p>Macau is located on a small, protruding island at the southern end of Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, forty li by water from Hong Kong and about eighty li from Guangzhou, with an area of only eleven square miles. In the 16th century, it was a trading base, always under the influence of Hong Kong. Therefore, the Macau government allowed the arrogance of anti-Japanese Chinese and tacitly approved the large-scale smuggling to the Chongqing area. However, in today's post-Greater East Asia War era, Britain's influence in East Asia has been completely expelled, and Japan's influence has swept across East Asia. Therefore, the attitude of the Macau government has naturally changed with the wind.</p>
<p>Economically, Macau has always been dependent on Hong Kong. It only prospered for a time due to the blockade of the Pearl River and re-export trade. Since the subordinate relationship with Hong Kong in economic terms was severed, trade with the mainland and Southeast Asia has also been cut off, leaving it completely isolated and unable to avoid dependence on Japan.</p>
<p>Today, there are also Japanese people and Japanese trading companies in Macau. Chinese merchants and hotel waiters all understand Japanese. In the dance halls attached to hotels, one can also hear "Kōjō no Tsuki" and other Japanese songs. In 1937, the Macau government's finances had an income of 4.78 million patacas and expenditures of 5 million patacas. Among the income, 2.7 million patacas, accounting for 56 percent, came from gambling and opium. Last year's income was only 4.25 million patacas, less than 670,000 patacas compared to previous years. In addition, prices have risen tenfold or twentyfold, so at least twice the budget is needed to cope. Therefore, the Macau government is in dire straits, with both ends not meeting.</p>
<p>Because of the cutoff of imports, the 140,000 to 150,000 tourists who came from Hong Kong and other places every year have also stopped coming. Therefore, Macau, once a place of joy, has now become a quiet city. Chongqing places emphasis on Macau for work related to overseas Chinese, with many Blue Shirts infiltrating, collecting intelligence, carrying out propaganda, and warning and threatening overseas Chinese to stay away from Japan. Merchants, in fact, have a difficult relationship that makes it necessary to cooperate with the Japanese side, but in these three years, five people have been assassinated for approaching the Japanese side. This is Chongqing's silent answer to the Chinese. Acts of violence are carried out openly in broad daylight, and not a single perpetrator has been arrested. In Macau, besides the Japanese consulate, there is also a British consulate, as well as honorary consulates of Thailand and the Netherlands. The British consulate has a large budget, gathering information after the loss of Hong Kong, carrying out anti-Axis incitement and propaganda, and secretly operating actively. Like Lisbon in Europe, it connects Britain and the United States with Chongqing, and is used as a base for espionage in place of Hong Kong. (Shō: From the February 16th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>25th Anniversary of the Red Army's Founding; Stalin's Address to Soldiers; Acknowledges Imminent German Counteroffensive; Calls on the People to Mobilize All Forces</h3>
<p>Ankara, 23rd (Havas) – Soviet Supreme Commander Stalin issued an address to soldiers on the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Red Army, stating briefly: The Soviet Union is solely bearing the heavy responsibility of the war because the Second Front has not yet been opened. The purpose of establishing the Red Army is not to conquer other countries but to ensure peace and the Soviet Union's friendly relations with all countries. Although the Red Army was provoked in 1941, it was able to resist the attack without the help of a Second Front. The 25th anniversary of the founding of the Red Army coincides with a critical juncture in the war, which is particularly gratifying. The offensive in March has achieved the following results: The Soviet Army has captured Stalingrad, Voronezh, Tikhoretsk, Ingulets, North Ossetia, Kabardians, Ichkeria, Kalmykia, Stavropol, Krasnodar, Shershensky, Kashajev, Adygejsk, Rostov, Kharkov, and Kursk. Stalin warned the people and the army not to think that victory could be achieved in a short period. Although the German army is in trouble, it is not incapable of restoring its strength. It would be foolish to think that the German army would abandon a single meter of Soviet land without a fight. Stalin urged the people to mobilize all their forces and reiterated the Soviet Union's war aims, not only to recover Soviet territory but also to occupy Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Moldova. Considering that the German army will not only resist but also launch a counteroffensive, Stalin issued three orders: (1) Strictly train the Red Army; (2) Intensify the attack; (3) Intensify activities behind enemy lines. Stalin concluded the "Address to Soldiers" by cheering for the Bolshevik Party, which organized the Red Army and enabled it to win victories.</p>
<h3>Canadian Prime Minister Warns the Public Not to Be Prematurely Optimistic About the War Situation</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Havas) – According to a dispatch from Ottawa, Canadian Prime Minister King delivered a speech in Ottawa yesterday, warning the people not to be falsely optimistic about the war situation. He stated that Canada's so-called severe trials in 1943 were unprecedented, as major events occurred one after another, and their speed has increased. In terms of armaments, the Allied and Axis powers are now on an equal footing.</p>
<h3>Eastern Front Main Battlefield Thaws; German Army Launches Fierce Counteroffensive; No Changes in the Situation West of Kharkov</h3>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet border, 23rd (Havas) – On the Eastern Front's main battlefield, the Soviet army's offensive has greatly slowed down due to heavy losses and the thawing of the land. The German counteroffensive intensified yesterday. However, the Red Army still maintains its offensive towards Dnepropetrovsk and Poltava. Moscow also admitted that German resistance has strengthened. The Red Army is now thirty-five miles away from Dnepropetrovsk. In addition, the Soviet Union is reported to have made some progress west of Rostov, Voroshilovgrad, and Krasnodar. However, the German counteroffensive south of Kramatorskaya is also very fierce. Even within the pocket in the Caucasus region, the German counteroffensive is becoming increasingly fierce. Recent Soviet communiqués only stated that they had captured several places in Ukraine and the Kuban River basin. As for other areas, it was said that they were continuing to advance in the original direction. According to Soviet newspaper reports, elite German troops have been sent to the west and southwest of Kharkov to curb the Red Army's offensive. The Red Army there intends to break through the German defense line between Poltava and the Dnieper River.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to news from the Eastern Front, the German army has launched a full-scale counteroffensive in the area between the Donets River and the bend of the Dnieper River since the afternoon of the 21st. Fierce fighting broke out at noon on the 22nd along the railway line connecting Pavlograd, Krasnograd, and Arumink. After the German army retreated from Lower Kharkov, the main force of the Soviet army moved rapidly in that direction, attempting to break through Dnepropetrovsk via Sinelnikovo, but was completely trapped in a dilemma due to the fierce German counteroffensive. According to a United Press dispatch from Moscow, it was admitted that the Soviet army had been forced to retreat from the north. There were no changes in the Kharkov area and other fronts. Overall, the decline in the Soviet army's combat power can no longer be concealed.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Havas) – According to observations by German reconnaissance units, after recapturing Kharkov, the Soviet army immediately transferred a considerable number of troops from that area to support the Donets Basin and the Dnieper River delta. Since February 8th, the Soviet army has attempted to advance from Izyum towards Mariupol on the coast of the Sea of Azov, while another part has pressed towards Zaporozhye in the southwest. However, this attempt, apart from some initial minor victories, has now completely failed. At the same time, the German counteroffensive launched from the west is becoming increasingly fierce. German armored vehicle formations successfully attacked the left flank of the Soviet army from the side on Sunday. Several Soviet units were surrounded, and more than half were annihilated. Two railway junctions that had been occupied by the Soviet army a few days ago have been recaptured by the German army. The terrain in the eastern part of the Donets industrial area is favorable for defense. The fighting in the Taganrog area is currently calm. The Soviet army has repeatedly carried out its encirclement maneuvers and has even broken through the German defense line, but has been driven back by the German counteroffensive. Frontal attacks by the enemy have yielded little success and have been paid for at a very heavy price. The situation northwest and west of Kharkov remains unchanged. The Soviet offensive in that area has weakened. The Soviet army is very active in the Oryol area, but the German counteroffensive is also increasing. On Sunday, the enemy no longer counterattacked between Lake Ilmen and Lake Ladoga. However, this current tranquility does not indicate that the Soviet army has abandoned its offensive to the north, as it is the calm before the storm.</p>
<p>German War Report</p>
<p>German Führer Headquarters, 23rd (Havas) – This afternoon's German war report stated that the Soviet army's attempt to achieve a major victory in southern Eastern Europe did not come to fruition. The enemy initially wanted to break through the German line of defense but failed. They then wanted to copy the German army's rear east of the Donets industrial area but were either annihilated or dispersed. The Soviet army, which attempted a large-scale encirclement south of Kharkov, was forced to retreat to the Dnieper. The German army cut off the enemy's communications and bombarded them from all sides. Many enemy troops were annihilated. German aircraft detected the location of enemy reinforcements and attacked them head-on. In view of the unpredictable weather, which is sometimes cold and sometimes warm, it is difficult for the Soviet army to launch large-scale military operations, so they are focusing on the area north of Kharkov, as well as the central and northern parts of Eastern Europe, hoping to gain something. Yesterday, the Soviet army repeatedly attacked the Kupiansk bridgehead, fought hard for a long time, and retreated with heavy losses. In the Donets area, several Soviet divisions again attempted to break through our positions but were still repelled. Between the Donets and the Dnieper, our tank and infantry units, with the help of aircraft, launched a fierce attack on the enemy army and annihilated the elite Soviet troops. There is still fierce fighting west of Kharkov and south of Oryol. The large-scale attacks by the Soviet air force, artillery, and tank units northeast and north of Oryol were all repelled. 55 Soviet tanks were destroyed. The Soviet army's attack on the bridgehead at Volkhov failed to return. South of Lake Ladoga, a large Soviet army attacked unsuccessfully and lost 47 tanks.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Havas) – Responsible officials stated that fierce fighting has resumed in the southern Eastern Front, especially in the Kupiansk, Novorossiysk, and Don River estuary areas. The attacking Soviet troops all suffered heavy blows and retreated. Between Kharkov and Oryol, the enemy's offensive failed, and 55 tanks were destroyed. The fighting in the Leningrad-Schlüsselburg area has also intensified at the same time. The enemy attacked fiercely under the cover of tanks and aircraft but made no progress. Fierce fighting is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Havas) – Military figures here stated that German aircraft heavily attacked the Soviet army between the Donets and the Dnieper and northwest of Kharkov yesterday, destroying 222 Soviet tanks, as well as more than 500 horse-drawn carriages and motorcycles. Many enemy cannons were silenced by low-flying German aircraft bombing. Our aircraft bombed the port area of Tuapse, and a large Soviet transport ship near the coast of the Caucasus was hit and damaged. Soviet ships concentrated near Novorossiysk were dispersed by German aircraft at night. On the northern Eastern Front, German aircraft heavily bombed railways and highways. The Soviet army's supplies and provisions encountered bombing. 39 Soviet aircraft were shot down yesterday, including six shot down by anti-aircraft guns.</p>

<h3>French Government Formally Announces the Abandonment of Extraterritorial Rights in China; French Concessions in Tianjin, Beijing, and This City are Included in the Return; Wartime Economic Policies are Expected to be Implemented Smoothly in the Future</h3>
<p>Allied Press dispatch from this city: The French government has decided to abandon extraterritorial rights in China. This is a de facto recognition of the Nanjing government and lays the foundation for adjusting relations between the two countries. According to Allied Press reports, the return of the French concessions to the National Government is also a natural event. At that time, Japan will cooperate with the National Government to handle the return of the French concessions and will, at least for the time being, protect the returned concessions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, on Tuesday night, economic circles in this city pointed out that the French government's intention to return the Shanghai French Concession, that is, to return all administrative power to the National Government, will avoid various obstacles in effectively strengthening wartime economic policies in the future. Although the policies of the French Concession authorities in the past mostly imitated the Public Concession, there were still some differences, so the methods of economic management often could not proceed smoothly. This drawback can be avoided in the future.</p>
<h3>Vegetable Sources Increase; Vegetable Market Prices Drop Slightly; Authorities Repeatedly Confer on Measures to Suppress Prices; Decide to Strictly Prohibit Manipulation and Price Increases</h3>
<p>Various vegetables and fresh goods that can be used as side dishes, such as fish, shrimp, and meat, have seen their selling prices increase daily due to the influence of sources and the manipulation and monopolization by market vendors. Although the authorities have repeatedly ordered and emphasized suppressing rising prices, these merchants often used excuses to pursue high profits. It is now learned that, as the Lunar New Year is about to pass, vegetable sources are increasing. At the same time, the purchasing power of citizens is weakening. Under these circumstances of oversupply, market prices have inevitably declined slightly. Therefore, in recent days, the selling prices of vegetables and fresh goods have been lower than before.</p>
<p>Increased Sources; Selling Prices Can Fall</p>
<p>According to a person familiar with the vegetable market situation who spoke to reporters, due to the even distribution of rain last winter, the growth of various vegetable seedlings in the suburban farms was quite rapid, and the harvesting period has now arrived. In addition, because the vegetable market prices in this city have doubled compared to last year, general vegetable vendors are rushing to transport vegetables because they can make high profits. For this reason, the source of vegetables has greatly increased. Therefore, the selling price of vegetables in this city is expected to decline again. However, the authorities have always strictly controlled the selling prices of various goods and will resolutely adhere to their original intentions regarding the prices of vegetables related to the daily lives of general citizens, making every effort to curb vendors from raising prices to seek profits, and also helping to dredge sources.</p>
<p>Authorities Send Personnel to Inspect Weights and Measures</p>
<p>The English-language "Times" reported that after the authorities of the two concessions sent inspectors to implement price suppression and inspect weights and measures in various vegetable markets, the prices of most foods, especially fresh meat and vegetables, had slightly decreased yesterday. According to the report, the creation of these new high prices was due to speculative activities that prevailed at the beginning of this month.</p>
<p>Strict Rules Expected to be Announced</p>
<p>According to the expectations of general residents, the authorities will take unprecedentedly severe actions after conducting the investigation, and the results will certainly be able to further reduce prices and stabilize people's livelihoods. Furthermore, according to many observers, once the new steps to crack down on illegal vendors are implemented, there is no doubt that the prices of most goods will fall back to below the price levels before the Lunar New Year. Regarding the increase in prices, it is widely believed that the authorities are prepared to respond with effective methods again and may organize a strict system to control prices and announce strict rules for controlling prices.</p>
<p>Repeated Consultations to Discuss Responses</p>
<p>At the same time, according to inquiries made by reporters, the authorities have already recognized that the recent resurgence of rising prices of goods (including vegetable market prices) in the concessions over the past month is extremely noteworthy. Relevant parties have repeatedly conferred in the past week to discuss more effective ways to respond. Before these methods are fully completed, the authorities will implement emergency measures to try to bring prices back down.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Spokesman Releases Statement</h3>
<p>According to a dispatch from the Domei News Agency in this city, a Japanese military spokesman announced at a meeting of foreign reporters on Tuesday that, following the National Government's entry into the war, the Japanese army launched its first offensive in Central China, in Hankou and on the north bank of the Yangtze River. They have fully assessed the fighting ability and morale of the Chongqing forces, finding them to be quite demoralized. The purpose of this move by the Japanese army is to hinder Chongqing from reinforcing Yunnan. This type of rear attack is intended to make Chongqing officials feel anxious. The spokesman also pointed out that one of the most important characteristics of this Japanese military action is the actual support provided to the Japanese army by the Nanjing troops. He predicted that the military strength of Nanjing will inevitably gradually increase until it can maintain the security and order of the occupied territories. Currently, this task is being undertaken by the Japanese army. Chongqing claims that the Japanese army's actions in Central China are only to prevent Chongqing forces from being transferred to southern Yunnan, but in fact, Japan can take the opportunity to invade the interior.</p>
<h3>Press Corps from This City Inspects Cleared Areas, Warmly Welcomed by Officials and Civilians Along the Way</h3>
<p>A group of Shanghai reporters set off to visit the cleared areas in this city, led by Director Liu Changqing of the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai branch of the Cleared Areas Committee. Yesterday was the second day of their trip, passing through Zhoupu, Nanhui, and other places, where they were warmly welcomed by local officials and civilians.</p>
<h3>Eliminating Black Market for Gold Bars and Jewelry Expected Within the Week, Relaxation of Price Controls to be Resolved Simultaneously</h3>
<p>According to a report received yesterday afternoon by a Datong News Agency reporter from relevant sources, the stalemate regarding the suspension of gold jewelry exchange by silver shops is expected to be resolved satisfactorily within the week. Since the Price Control Department of the Public Works Department repeatedly met with representatives of silver shops, listened to detailed complaints about the difficulties currently faced by the industry, they have begun to closely monitor the behind-the-scenes activities that are fueling the gold market price surge. They are currently carefully studying appropriate measures to eliminate the gold industry's black market and plan to implement them within a week at the latest. At that time, the issue of relaxing price controls on jewelry, as requested by silver shops, can be resolved accordingly. According to news from the silver shop industry, the Price Control Department authorities will make appropriate arrangements for the issue of relaxing price controls on jewelry in the near future. According to observations from within the industry, the possible solution to this problem is the strict restriction of the gold market's after-hours trading, because relaxing price controls on jewelry is only a temporary solution. If the gold market's after-hours trading is not eradicated, the threat of soaring gold prices currently faced by silver shops is likely to reappear. Therefore, in order to stabilize jewelry market prices, it is hoped that the authorities will promptly adopt the aforementioned wise measures.</p>
<h3>Collection of Entertainment Donation, Etc. in Western Shanghai to Follow New Regulations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai West Office of the Finance Bureau, in levying telephone and entertainment donations, bill donations, and house donations, has been approved by the Shanghai West Financial Advisory Committee, revising the house donation tax rate to 40% and drafting new regulations for the collection of the above taxes. These have been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. It is understood that the Municipal Finance Bureau has decided to start collecting them from February of the 32nd year [1943], instructing the Shanghai West Office to comply with the regulations and issuing Public Notice No. 33 of the Cai character yesterday (23rd) for general knowledge.</p>
<h3>Elementary Schools in Various Districts of This City to Raise Teacher Salaries, Education Bureau Issues Order to Comply</h3>
<p>The Education Bureau of this city, in view of the very meager salaries of elementary school teachers in various districts under its jurisdiction and the inability to secure their livelihoods, which is insufficient to dedicate themselves to their duties and value education, yesterday issued orders to the various district offices under its jurisdiction to increase salaries in accordance with actual circumstances. All district-established elementary schools should pay salaries in accordance with the city school teacher salary standards starting this month.</p>
<h3>Navy Chief Ren Yuandao and Others Visit Japanese Naval Commander</h3>
<p>Naval Minister Ren Yuandao, accompanied by Deputy Naval Minister Zhao Guizhang, Jiang Xiyuan, President of the China Naval Academy, Bao Yimin, Commander of the Weihaiwei Naval Base, Sa Fuchou, Commander of the Guangzhou Naval Base, Ye Kesong, Director of the Hydrographic Bureau, and others, drove to the Hongkou area at around 1:30 PM yesterday to visit General Yoshida, Commander of the friendly naval fleet. They held talks for about an hour before departing.</p>
<h3>400 Houses in Zhabei to be Transferred to City Government This Morning, Rent of 3 Million Yuan to be Returned Simultaneously, Protocol to be Signed by Chinese and Japanese Officials</h3>
<p>Four hundred houses and other assets in the Zhabei district, because their original owners left at the beginning of the war, were managed by the Japanese military authorities. Now that the situation has become much more stable and international relations are becoming closer, the above-mentioned properties will be released from military management today and formally transferred to the management of the municipal government by the Japanese authorities. In addition, there is also one-third of the rent paid by tenants under the management of the Japanese authorities, totaling 500,000 Japanese yen, equivalent to over 2.5 million storage certificates, which will also be transferred to the Chinese side at the same time. It is believed that houses and other buildings in the concession that are in similar situations will also be gradually transferred to the Chinese side in the future. This transfer will not affect the tenants in the houses, as the rent will still be collected by the Japanese Residents Association on behalf of the Chinese authorities at the original rates. The protocol for today's transfer of houses is scheduled to be signed at 10:00 AM this morning in the conference room of the Japanese Naval Garrison Office. The Japanese side will be signed by the naval garrison official, and the Chinese side will be signed by Mayor Chen.</p>
<h3>Fashion Industry Implements Price Controls for Sales</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department's Materials Control Department has imposed price controls on all kinds of goods to strictly prevent unscrupulous merchants from monopolizing, hoarding, and raising prices for sale. Therefore, it has ordered the guilds of various industries to investigate and submit the cost of goods to the department for review. The fashion industry in this city has already complied with the authorities' price control measures, notifying all member fashion companies to implement price controls for sales, selling goods at the actual marked price, without discounts, in order to standardize and facilitate transactions. These measures have been implemented since yesterday. If any fashion company dares to violate the rules and exceed the price limits, it will be reported to the authorities for severe punishment.</p>
<h3>YMCA Restaurant Lawsuit Procedure Does Not Comply with Legal Requirements</h3>
<p>The Sichuan Road YMCA previously rented surplus rooms facing the road to Lin Chunling to open the Zai Nian Hui Western Restaurant for more than 20 years. The relationship between the two parties has always been harmonious. In the meantime, due to modifications to the rent and conditions, although the contract has been changed several times, the main principles have never changed. Recently, the YMCA, represented by Ling Xitao, filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court against Lin, seeking to recover the property for its own use, claiming that the room was contracted in nature and there was no lease relationship. The case was heard in court yesterday by Judge Mo. The plaintiff first stated the above. The defendant's lawyer, Wu Linkun, responded, stating that the YMCA is a corporate body, and the current plaintiff is only an employee of the YMCA and has no right to sue on behalf of the law. Moreover, it is still unknown whether this case is the original intention of the YMCA authorities. Therefore, the litigation procedure in this case is not in compliance with the law and the original complaint should be dismissed. After reviewing the circumstances in court, it was found that the litigation procedure in this case was indeed not in compliance with the law and the plaintiff should be ordered to submit a statement for correction and reschedule the trial.</p>
<h3>Authorities Assessing the Cost of Goods, Retail Prices Will Be Re-controlled, Deadline for Manufacturers to Report Costs is End of Month</h3>
<p>The Materials Control Department of the Public Works Department previously stipulated that the prices at which manufacturers and wholesalers sell goods in the Public Concession must not exceed the price tags on January 23, and ordered all manufacturers and wholesalers to list the cost calculation and the price set on January 23 and submit them to the Materials Control Department for review by the end of this month. Currently, the guilds of various industries are rushing to submit the relevant information to the authorities within the deadline. According to sources, the Public Works Department's assessment of the manufacturing and wholesale prices of goods this time is actually a prelude to considering the re-control of retail prices. It reverses the previous practice by first assessing the manufacturing costs, legitimate profits, and wholesale prices, and then stabilizing retail prices within reasonable limits, in order to eliminate the possibility of retailers taking the increased purchase price as an excuse to raise prices privately. The investigation and cost calculation departments under the Materials Control Department are stepping up their work to make the price limits for manufacturing, wholesale, and retail of goods in this city into a new system, so that speculative merchants cannot use their tricks, and so that the guilds of various industries can assist the authorities in implementing price policies within this new system.</p>
<h3>Sudden Change in Mindset of British and Americans, Willing to Live in Concentration Camps, Rather Than Risk Crossing the Ocean to Retreat Home, Better to Live in a Camp and Ensure Safety</h3>
<p>(Special Report) The news that people from enemy countries such as Britain and the United States in Shanghai will be taken into "concentration camps," which was first published in this newspaper with official confirmation, has added a lot of talking points after tea and dinner. Some people say that they used to be too arrogant and overbearing, but now things have turned around, and they may become prisoners, which is truly fair and gratifying. Some people express regret and sigh for the sudden change in their situation. The world is changing and human affairs are unpredictable, which is nothing more than creating many handles for those who are accustomed to complaining about the world and criticizing customs.</p>
<p>Speaking of "concentration camps," it seems that everyone is talking about tigers and changing their faces, and everyone is in danger. Those who have read Jan Valtin's famous novel "Out of the Night" will definitely resent the inhumane situation in "concentration camps" in a certain European country, which seems to be a living hell on earth, and once you enter, there is no life. However, the "concentration camp" mentioned here, where some British and Americans have already entered and some are about to enter, its official name is "Civil Assembly Center." According to Hirota, the information minister of the Japanese embassy, the concentration of British and Americans is only for "military needs" and is not intended to give them bad treatment.</p>
<p>I remember a few days after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, someone asked a Japanese military spokesman whether the British and Americans in Shanghai would enter concentration camps. The answer was very clever: "Shanghai itself is a large concentration camp." At that time, everyone congratulated the British and Americans, and the expatriates of the belligerent countries could still maintain considerable freedom. Later, this "large concentration camp" was reduced to areas other than restaurants, dining rooms, dance halls, and theaters. There were more foreigners on the street with red cloths tied on their arms with "A," "B," or "X" written on them. Generally, black Americans and some foreigners who have always been regarded as stateless or mixed-race unexpectedly surrounded the red cloth of "A" or "B" on their arms and proudly regarded themselves as excellent ethnic groups. Unexpectedly, how long has passed, the people with red armbands will disappear into the "concentration camp" so quickly.</p>
<p>The status of British and Americans in Shanghai has always been too high. They lived a more comfortable and comfortable life than anyone else. Especially when foreign exchange was tight, one US dollar could be fully exchanged for more than 30 Chinese yuan. Moreover, prices were not as high as they are now. Earning gold ocean dollars and using Chinese legal currency, who can match the satisfaction of material enjoyment? General bank managers, foreign firm managers, hotel owners, stockbrokers, real estate developers, and civil servants have made a fortune. They live in noble foreign houses, drive streamlined cars, and eat delicious Western food. Who doesn't envy them? Now, houses and properties are managed by the military, and furniture for making money is affixed with seals that cannot be moved. The economic source is completely exhausted. Large restaurants can only be visited but not enjoyed. Drama and movies cannot be appreciated, and they even have to enter concentration camps. Fortunately, they have enjoyed it too much in the past, so it is right to tighten their belts and endure it.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of them will complain about their misfortune. Why didn't they follow the advice of the government authorities to retreat before the war? That was in 1940. At that time, the situation in the Far East was urgent. The US government dispatched three large ships to China to evacuate overseas Chinese. No less than 3,000 women, children, and men who "did not need to live" took the opportunity to return home. Later, Britain followed suit and dispatched Taikoo ships to transport a large number of expatriates from Shanghai to India and Australia. However, at that time, both Britain and the United States always believed that people who were sufficient to "fly the flag" must continue to stay, so diplomatic officials such as consuls, important figures in the industrial, commercial, and financial circles still stayed in their positions. When everyone thought that the Pacific War that would not break out would eventually break out, diplomatic officials and well-known people retreated in exchange, and those who are still left now have a share in entering the "concentration camp."</p>
<p>In fact, after the Nanjing government declared war on Britain and the United States on January 9, the British and Americans in Shanghai were prepared to enter the "concentration camp." Although the rumors were mixed, they were still calm as always. Some even rushed to pack their luggage early. If someone asked, "I heard that you will be concentrated," their answer was often, "We are ready," and their attitude was very firm. Of course, no one can deny that every people should fully represent the national character of a country, and that spirit of not avoiding danger for the sake of the country and maintaining the dignity of the country is worth emulating.</p>
<p>Where exactly will they be concentrated? It is said that it is near the concession and western Shanghai, farther away in Pudong and Wusong, and farthest away in Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, and Hangzhou. Probably a week before the designated concentration date, they will receive the order from Japanese Consul General Tajiri and go to the designated place to gather on the designated date, and then enter the pre-arranged "concentration camp" in a team. Personal utensils, bedding, clothing, tableware, and books can be brought in, but the quantity is limited to what can be contained in four small boxes. The original residence and the furniture in the house will be taken over by the Japanese military authorities.</p>
<p>What is life like in the "concentration camp?" It is not easy to know because people who have entered the "concentration camp" cannot reveal the situation inside, and people who have not entered the "concentration camp" cannot enjoy the right to visit it first. It is said that everything in the "concentration camp" is operated by the concentrators themselves, and all food, laundry, cleaning, and labor are handled by themselves. Single men are concentrated together, and families are also together, regardless of age, and treated equally. It is also said that there is a "concentration camp" in western Shanghai, which is the original site of a university. The dormitory has become the bedroom of the concentrators, one room for four men and one room for four women, separated from each other. This probably refers to married couples, and although family members can be in the same camp, they cannot live in the same room. The concentration work may be completed this month, and two batches will enter the camp on the 25th and 28th respectively.</p>
<p>Recently, I asked an American, "Is there still hope for retreat?"</p>
<p>"I don't want to retreat anymore," he said with interest, "Because rather than crossing the Atlantic Ocean and risking being attacked by submarines to retreat home, I would rather stay here safely and live in a concentration camp. Fortunately, the war will eventually end."</p>
<p>This is a sudden change in the mindset of the British and Americans.</p>

<h3>Reforming the Ticket Selling System on Public Trolleys</h3>
<p>— Wu Xinmin</p>
<p>The trend of ticket sellers embezzling money on trams seems to have intensified recently, which is of course a huge loophole for the company. Passengers often indulge and encourage this behavior without correcting it, which promotes the rise in ticket prices. In the end, they themselves suffer the loss. I hereby put forward the following suggestions, hoping that the authorities will thoroughly reform.</p>
<p>(1) Abolish the on-board ticket selling system and replace it with ticket booths at each station. Passengers must purchase tickets at the station before boarding. Absolutely no tickets will be sold on the bus.</p>
<p>(2) Set up a gatekeeper who specializes in opening the doors at each level of the car. Passengers must hand over their tickets to the gatekeeper for tearing up when getting off the car.</p>
<p>(3) Adjust the location of each station and extend the distance between the stations as much as possible so that the distance between each station is equal, so that it is easy to manage and the fares are equal to the distance. There will be absolutely no situation where one station is cheap and another station suffers.</p>
<p>(4) Issue more preferential tickets such as monthly and seasonal tickets, because this can also help a lot of convenience in business.</p>
<p>(5) The salaries of employees should be increased according to the level of living to ensure their lives, so that they no longer think about fraud. At the same time, when fraudulent behavior is discovered, severe punishment should be imposed, such as suspension, etc., to make them wary.</p>

<h3>Residents of Western Shanghai Should Quickly Apply for Licenses for Self-Defense Guns</h3>
<p>The Shanghai West Police Department's verification of self-defense guns in the area has been approved by the Municipal Government, and the department will handle the license issuance procedures. According to reporters, the department has now been issued a type C six-part self-defense firearm license by the Municipal Government.

<h3>To Eliminate Abuses in Public Rice Sales in Western Shanghai, "Materials Rationing Certificates" Will Be Issued, Rice Will Be Issued With Certificates to Prevent Profiteering by Unscrupulous Elements, Census Will Be Conducted First, and Households Will Be Checked One by One</h3>
<p>Since being ordered to handle public rice sales, the Shanghai West District Office has found that its jurisdiction is vast and the situation is complicated, resulting in unscrupulous elements taking the opportunity to use their powers to falsely report and embezzle. The supervisory authorities have repeatedly discovered this matter and are deeply angered. In addition to thoroughly investigating those who commit fraud, they will also conduct a preliminary census and then check the households in the entire district one by one. The district office will reissue household registration certificates, and in order to prevent unscrupulous elements from committing fraud, it will change to issuing "Materials Rationing Certificates" and issue rice with certificates. It has now been reported to the Municipal Government, and it can be implemented as soon as it is approved.</p>

<h3>Quantity of Rice for the 28th Period Household Registration is Still 2.5 Sheng, Whole Rice May Increase to 2 Sheng, Bicycle Ration and Miscellaneous Grains Twice Next Month</h3>
<p>In order to fully ration food to Shanghai citizens, the authorities have ordered foreign rice from Thailand and Vietnam to be transported to Shanghai to provide relief, and have also purchased domestic rice from various districts in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. At the same time, they have purchased flour produced by flour mills in Central China. Now, in view of the fact that foreign rice has been continuously transported to Shanghai, the purchase of domestic rice has been quite successful, and the output of flour from various factories has increased, it has been decided to make the rationed food for each person meet the proper needs of each person. Regarding the 28th period household registration grain, according to a report by our reporter to the rice industry yesterday, 644 registered rice shops in the Public Concession and the French Concession yesterday received purchase orders from the rice and flour rationing office for whole rice, broken rice, and flour. The quantity is the same as last period, but the quantity of whole rice has increased and the quantity of broken rice has decreased compared to before. According to this calculation, the next period's household registration grain is 2 sheng of whole rice, 0.5 sheng of broken rice, and 1.75 lbs of flour.</p>
<p>Registered Rice Shops Have Already Taken Delivery</p>
<p>As for the price of registered rice shops, whole rice and broken rice are both 304 yuan per 200 jin bag, and flour is 92 yuan per 49 pound bag. The selling price is 6.3 yuan for 2.5 sheng of whole rice and broken rice, and 3.85 yuan for 1.75 lbs of flour, totaling 10.015 yuan. However, the so-called whole rice includes white rice and brown rice. It is understood that various registered rice shops have paid the payment and taken delivery from the designated Taikoo Warehouse, Zhejiang Xingye Warehouse, Mitsubishi Wharf Warehouse, etc. They are allowed to be sold with rice purchase certificates and flour certificates from March 1, but the exact figures and prices are still subject to the announcement of the authorities.</p>
<p>Edible Oil Certificate Will Be Reissued Immediately</p>
<p>In addition, it is understood that miscellaneous grains can be purchased twice from March. These miscellaneous grains are mostly beans. The quantity, date, and price of each purchase will be determined by the Public Works Department in a public announcement. As for the three types of purchase certificates for oil, sugar, and miscellaneous grains, in addition to the sugar purchase certificate being issued together by the rice purchase certificate issuing offices starting yesterday, the reissue dates for the miscellaneous grain certificate and the edible oil certificate have already been arranged, and they can be issued together starting on the 26th.</p>

<h3>Current Issues - Secretary-General Zhao of the Municipal Government Broadcasts Yesterday</h3>
<p>Secretary-General Zun Yue of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, at the invitation of the Shanghai Broadcasting Station, delivered a speech on the platform at 7:30 PM yesterday to celebrate the second anniversary of the China Broadcasting Association. The topic was "Several Current Issues," and the content elaborated in detail on how the people should cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. The original words are recorded below:</p>
<p>Today is the second anniversary of the Broadcasting Association. Everyone knows the achievements of the Broadcasting Association, but its significance and spirit are still worth mentioning as an introduction to today's speech.</p>
<p>Looking back to two years ago, when the Broadcasting Association was just established, it was also shortly after the National Government returned to the capital. Since Mr. Wang advocated the peace movement and the enthusiastic support of a group of people, it took a considerable amount of time to achieve the goal of returning to the capital. However, although it was said to be returning to the capital at that time, it was as difficult as starting from scratch. When we first arrived in the capital, broken houses and dilapidated walls, and desolation met the eye. The situation of the people being displaced was truly moving, but at the same time, it further aroused our courage. No matter what, we must achieve the goal of national rejuvenation. We must overcome all hardships and difficulties. Under the leadership of the Chairman, we must fulfill our aspirations. In this way, day by day, although there are many difficulties, the achievements are gradually progressing. For example, the Broadcasting Association was also established shortly after the return to the capital. Since the establishment of the Broadcasting Association, look at the construction of radio stations everywhere. It has progressed rapidly. All parts of the country, regardless of the distance of the location or the number of people, can be together. It simply broke the limitations of time and space. Not only can we get political news and normal entertainment, but we can also listen to the leader's instructions at any time and uplift our spirits. In particular, the Chairman recently instructed us on three points, namely, maintaining law and order, training the people, and increasing production, which are worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>The issue of maintaining law and order. Everyone may think that this is a matter for the military and police, and not necessarily the responsibility of every individual. However, everyone should know that if law and order are achieved through the efforts of every person, the military and police will achieve twice the result with half the effort. Currently, the strength of the military and police is generally increasing, especially in the work of the Qingxiang District, which is particularly diligent. But where is this foundation? The most important work is still in the Baojia system. The people cannot all become soldiers and police, but everyone is incorporated into the Baojia system. If the Baojia system is well managed, every move will be investigated. Of course, to put it mildly, bandits cannot sneak in. To put it bluntly, no large-scale roving bandits can attack villages and rob houses. So I say, as long as everyone pays attention to the Baojia system and at the same time pays attention to all the unusual movements, and does it according to the procedures, the maintenance of law and order will definitely be no problem.</p>
<p>Training the people is the most important thing. We not only train from schools, but also from all aspects. Schools can cultivate a person's knowledge, but if a group of people are to become modern and good citizens, schools cannot bear this responsibility. The Chairman himself also serves as the Chairman of the New National Movement Association, which is the meaning of this. The country needs scholars, but also needs citizens, especially strong citizens. Therefore, school education is to teach people knowledge, and the New National Movement is to train people to be human beings, starting from childhood, participating in youth groups, and doing it from the aspects of etiquette and physique. People with knowledge can of course use their strengths to take responsibility for the country and do things. However, if the general public does not meet the qualifications of citizens, that country cannot be maintained by a few people, let alone in the current era of participating in the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, training the people is definitely not the exclusive responsibility of education, or teachers and students, but the business of the general public in the society. In any case, those who know should teach those who do not know, and training a good citizen for the country is indeed fulfilling the greatest responsibility for the country, and also fulfilling the responsibility of revitalizing China.</p>
<p>Increasing production. Some people may think that increasing production cannot be done without large-scale factories and collective farms with thousands of acres of land. This is really not right. We must know that large-scale can indeed greatly increase production, and a small number of people can also accumulate small amounts into large amounts. We should know that in terms of quantity, if everyone weaves one more foot of cloth every day, the increased production will be very considerable. In terms of region, if farmers who plant fields and vegetables plant more along the river and on the hillside, the increased production will be even greater. Moreover, the autonomous small-scale increase in production in various places is much simpler than large-scale equipment, but the results are the same. The ancients had a sentence to scold people, called "idleness and laziness." This is the meaning of opposing people not engaging in production since ancient China. If we compare it again, the people in the countryside are really working hard to increase production, because they rely on this for a living. There are many opportunities to make money in the city, and they are not willing to do practical things. This point should be paid special attention to and taken as a warning. Furthermore, under the leadership of the Chairman in building the country, we should know more that we should go from revitalizing China to defending East Asia. This is not only China's need, but also China's responsibility. Especially Japan's hope for China is like this.</p>
<p>Extraterritoriality. Since the National Government declared its participation in the war, we have naturally been fulfilling the responsibility of a member of East Asia from an autonomous standpoint. However, because we have already participated in the war and stand on the same front, Japan has also automatically announced the abolition of extraterritoriality and the two major issues of returning concessions. Everyone should know that extraterritoriality is a matter of foreigners using their laws to enforce the laws of their own people within our country. In the current civilized environment, regarding laws, it has long been the principle of territoriality, not the principle of personality. All existence of the principle of personality can be regarded as a method of civilized people for uncivilized people, because they believe that the laws here are not applicable to civilized people. However, we Chinese laws must know that they are absolutely the laws of civilized people. However, foreigners have always underestimated China, so they have ignored the spirit of Chinese rule of law, and even today, they still do not believe us and adopt the principle of personality. In fact, all countries in the world study ancient Chinese law, especially the most perfect law of the Tang Dynasty, which has long become an important subject in world jurisprudence. However, because they do not attach importance to China, even ancient Chinese civilization is only provided for research in academic history, and they are not willing to apply it to modern times. Therefore, they have always refused to abolish the item of legal rights. However, Japan understands this point. In the position that we are all masters of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, he automatically announced the abolition of extraterritoriality. Originally, Japan's research on China is more detailed than that of Britain and the United States, and everyone is of the same race, respecting China and hoping for China's ideals, which cannot be compared with the hypocrisy of Britain and the United States. It seems that they resolutely abolished extraterritoriality. This really contains several meanings. First, it admits that Chinese law is suitable for modern application. Second, it admits that China is qualified enough not to adopt the principle of personality in law. Third, it proves that we are all members of Greater East Asia and should cooperate and coexist and prosper together. We have accepted Japan's kindness, and the people will naturally be more excited and make extra efforts to fulfill our responsibilities.</p>
<p>In addition to returning concessions, we must talk about the issue of returning concessions. We all know that it is most unreasonable for other countries to have concessions within our national borders, especially since these concessions were left over from defeats a hundred years ago, which is even more painful for the people. It is originally a very ordinary thing for the people of the two countries to trade and conduct commerce. Why should a special area be set aside that is not under the administrative system of this country? Our history of the past 100 years will be settled sooner or later. However, because of imperialism, for the sake of exploitation, this issue was never discussed no matter how good the diplomatic relations were in the past. However, this time, Japan, in order to respect our country and at the same time hope that China will use its autonomous spirit to jointly fulfill the responsibility of building Greater East Asia, resolutely announced the return of concessions. This kind of kindness is of course deeply appreciated by any Chinese people. However, it goes without saying that concessions have the disadvantages of concessions, but they also have the advantages of concessions. We don't have to obliterate everything. The material equipment, commercial prosperity, and other international characteristics, we are not unwelcome to foreign residents, and we are willing to maintain their equipment characteristics and everything else, especially all the equipment can be used for our use, as long as we intensify the use, all the places that should be preserved, so that the people in the city can live and work in peace and enjoy more, can achieve the effectiveness of increasing production. We must know that our recovery of concessions is not just a recovery in law and name, nor is it just a recovery of foreign houses and roads, and then it is over. We must strive to use the existing foundation after the recovery, and run it into the most ideal city, and make it play a greater effect. Regarding this point, I think everyone must have the same heart and the same reason. In short, we, as modern people, must fulfill modern responsibilities. To fulfill responsibilities, we must first understand everything. To understand everything, we must also pay attention at all times. However, this is not necessarily learned from books. For example, the Broadcasting Association can be regarded as serving the public and paying attention to all issues. This function, on the one hand, is to maintain politics for the country, and on the other hand, it is to serve the public, which is worthy of admiration. I hope everyone will not ignore it, and should use this opportunity as much as possible at any time. At the same time, we should also wish the Broadcasting Association a prosperous career and unlimited future. We must know that the success of the Broadcasting Association can reflect the revival of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Transportation Routes are Smooth and Unobstructed - There is No Worry of Fuel Shortage in this City - Existing Stock is Sufficient to Cope Fully</h3>
<p>Due to the active increase in prices of various foods and daily necessities in this port, a reporter from the Datong News Agency specially inquired with the local fuel industry authorities yesterday about the stock and transportation of goods in the industry. The following is a record of what they said:</p>
<p>Fuel Transportation to Shanghai is Continuous</p>
<p>Since last winter, a large amount of coal has been transported into this port. At present, firewood transported to Shanghai by ordinary villagers from the vicinity of Suzhou is also continuous. Therefore, the fuel required by residents in various districts of Shanghai has not experienced the slightest shortage. Moreover, the original stock in this port, according to the estimate in early winter last year, is sufficient to fully cope with the needs of this port. Because of the smooth transportation routes and the abundance of stock, the fuel item alone can stand still amid this price increase of all things.</p>
<p>Consumption Last Winter Decreased Significantly</p>
<p>According to the survey results, the consumption of fuel in this port last winter was actually lower than in previous years. It is said that the reason is that most residents can save on their own. Finally, it was said that in order to prevent a few coal merchants from imitating the trend during this period of soaring prices of all things, the authorities have strictly controlled the supply of coal and firewood, so as to prevent hoarding and speculation and black market activities.</p>

<p>Special Series on Various Places in Nanyang - No. 4</p>
<h3>A General Discussion of Malaya (1)</h3>
<p>- Voters</p>
<p>(1) Geographical Situation of Malaya</p>
<p>The former British Malaya starts from 6 degrees 43 minutes and 41 seconds north latitude, extends to 1 degree 15 minutes and 43 seconds south latitude at the southern end of Singapore, faces Borneo across the South China Sea to the east, confronts the northern part of Sumatra across the Strait of Malacca to the southwest, and borders Thailand to the north, facing Myanmar. The total area reaches 137,776.27 square kilometers (53,211.0 square miles).</p>
<p>The ground of Malaya is rugged and hilly, with mountain ranges running through the center, slightly deviating to the west side of the peninsula. The rivers are very short, of which the Perak River and the Pahang River are more important. However, the coast is tortuous and there are many natural good harbors. Both sides are sheltered by Sumatra, and there are not many storms. The east coast faces the South China Sea, and when the northeast monsoon wind rises, the wind and waves are not small.</p>
<p>Malaya is close to the equator, so it is like summer all year round. Fortunately, the sea breeze regulates it, and it is not very hot. The rainfall is very high, and it rains almost every other day. After the rain, it is as cool as autumn, and the summer heat disappears. Therefore, there is a popular saying that "four seasons are like summer, and a rain turns into autumn."</p>
<p>The population of Malaya, according to the estimate at the end of 1939, was a total of 5,396,706 people. The most outstanding phenomenon is that the population of our overseas Chinese accounts for the largest majority of the total population of Malaya, totaling 2,300,353 people. They mainly engage in commerce and mining, especially in the rubber industry and tin mining. The second are Malays, Indians, and there are also many Japanese residents. In addition, there are Europeans, Javanese, Annamese, Thais, Filipinos, and Eurasian mixed races. Malays mostly engage in agricultural labor, and Indians mostly engage in rubber tree planting. Among Europeans, the British account for the largest number, controlling the political and economic power, and are the rulers and exploiters of Malaya.</p>
<p>The population growth rate of Malaya is very high. In the recent 30 years, it has almost doubled. The main reason is due to the rapid development of the rubber and tin industries, which led to the increase in immigration to Malaya. The following table can show the population increase in recent years:</p>
<p>(1) Situation of Population Increase in Malaya (Unit: 1,000 people)</p>
<p>(2) Situation of Population Increase in Malaya (Unit: 1,000 people)</p>
<p>(Note) (1) Includes Christmas Island and Cocos Island, (2) Includes the cities of Buloh Pinang, Wellesley, and Taiping; (3) At the time of the survey, there were still 1,496 unsettled people.</p>
<p>(3) Population Statistics by Ethnic Group in Malaya in 1939</p>
<p>(One person per square mile)</p>
<p>(Density is the number of people per square mile.)</p>
<p>(2) A Summary of the History of Aggression by the Powers</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the former British Malaya is divided into three parts: one is the Straits Settlements, including Singapore Island, Penang, Malacca, etc.; two is the Federated Malay States, including Perak, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Pahang, etc.; and three is the Unfederated Malay States, composed of Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Perlis, Terengganu, etc., as well as Sarawak in Borneo, Brunei, Labuan Island, British North Borneo, Cocos Island (also known as Keeling Island), Christmas Island, and other British-owned islands. However, the British administrative divisions actually refer to the three as Malaya in general.</p>
<p>Historically, there have been records about Malaya in very ancient times. As early as 300 years before the Christian era, Ptolemy, who succeeded Alexander the Great as King of Egypt, is said to have known about the tin production in Malaya. There are even records in Arabic historical books of the ninth century about the tin production in the west coast of Malaya called "Kilah", which is actually today's Kedah. In fact, if we carefully examine ancient Chinese books, the ancient historical records about Malaya may be even more detailed.</p>
<p>The development of Singapore Island dates back 800 years ago. At that time, the people of Sumatra first went to the island, cleared the way through brambles and thorns, and gradually became known to all parties after 200 years. Later, it was invaded by King Megapit of Java, and the island was abandoned again as a fishing village, but the residents moved north to Malacca to engage in construction. Later, Malacca became a center of the Malay Peninsula because it was a key point of maritime transportation.</p>
<p>The first white people to discover Malaya were also those who discovered Malacca. The first Portuguese Gama (Vasco de Gama) to reach the East led 20 warships to India for the second time in 1502 and had extremely cordial relations with the Indian princes, gaining the establishment of commercial bases in several places. In 1503, the Portuguese Albufuerque (Affomso d`Albugurepue) consolidated the base in India, served as the "Governor" of India, and later occupied Ceylon and then Malacca, establishing a trading house here as a base for advancing eastward. At that time, there was no rubber, no oil and tin, and what Europeans were pursuing was the spices that were special products of the South. Therefore, at that time, the road that went north across the Tianshan Mountains to China to obtain silk was called the "Silk Road", while the road that went south across Malacca out of the South China Sea to obtain Nanyang spices was called the Spice Road. Therefore, once white people appeared on the Malay Peninsula, it began the fate of being invaded and plundered.</p>
<p>The Portuguese occupied Malacca for about a century, until 1641 when it was taken by the Dutch. The Dutch also occupied Malacca for a century. In 1824, the British returned Sumatra to the Dutch and exchanged it for Malacca. However, the British had already obtained Penang from the Sultan of Kedah in 1786 through the East India Company with an annual fee of 6,000 yuan, and built a base for dominating Nanyang there. At that time, colonial activities were mostly focused on the competition for key points in trade and transportation, aiming to maintain port cities, and the Malay Peninsula was turned into a chessboard for Western powers to divide and occupy. However, the British had a particularly favorable position in Malaya due to the enhancement of their progress after the industrial revolution. In addition to exchanging for Malacca, it also used the old trick of piracy to plunder land in Nanyang, such as Wellesley across from Penang, and Pangkor Island, Simbilan Island, etc., and forcibly took them as its own protectorates, such as Selangor, etc., and sometimes even forcibly obtained free trade rights to support its power, taking advantage of opportunities to gradually make the entire Malay Peninsula fall under the control of the British Empire. Thus, at the beginning of the 20th century, the so-called Straits Settlements were formed, and Perak, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, and Pangkor were organized into a federation, while in other non-federated states, British "advisers" controlled the actual ruling power. This is how they ruled Malaya for about 150 years, until the start of the Greater East Asia War, when they were driven out by the Japanese army, ending the history of the British Empire monopolizing the natural resources of Malaya and exploiting the blood and tears of its residents.</p>
<h3>Promoting the Future of Hygiene Undertakings - The Authorities Promote Hygiene Work - Various Hygiene Propaganda Campaigns Have Been Effective - Hoping that Residents Will Jointly Take Responsibility for Persistent Progress</h3>
<p>The hygiene authorities of the two concessions, because the statistics of diseases and deaths of residents in this port have not shown a significant decrease, have held various hygiene campaigns in the past year to enable residents to understand various hygiene common sense,</p>
<p>Repeatedly Held Propaganda Campaigns</p>
<p>In the past year, the various hygiene propaganda campaigns launched by the two concessions include vaccination, rat extermination and epidemic prevention, banning the sale of pufferfish, and banning spitting everywhere. The direct reasons are to prevent smallpox, prevent the occurrence of plague, prevent the spread of cholera, eliminate poisoning situations, and reduce the spread of diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy, and colds. Indirectly, it is also hoped that every resident will pay attention to health work</p>
<p>Clean Up Street and Alley Filth</p>
<p>The hygiene authorities said that the results of the above-mentioned campaigns and propaganda have been effective, and expressed that this is the bright future of public hygiene undertakings in Shanghai, and said that in the future, in addition to supervising residents to jointly take responsibility for the various hygiene undertakings that have been promoted and not to be lazy, other matters such as the mess of fruit peels on the road, the accumulation of garbage in the alleys, and the stagnant water in low-lying ground will also be cleaned up. On the one hand, they will order the small workers (i.e., street sweepers) or foremen responsible for cleaning to step up their work, and on the other hand, they hope that residents will pay attention to themselves,</p>
<p>Send Personnel to Re-examine Unclean Households</p>
<p>As for the residents' own houses, the hygiene authorities will also pay considerable attention to them in the future. During the first period of the campaign to ban spitting everywhere, the hygiene department sent personnel to various small alleys with dense crowds to conduct investigations, and advised the heads of households to be responsible for organizing and cleaning up everything inside the house. It is reported that during the most recent period, the hygiene department will also send the original investigators to conduct re-examinations of various households.</p>

<h3>Authorities Consider Merging Small Banks, Pawnshops, and Insurance Companies: Concrete Plan Not Yet Officially Decided</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Pacific War in this city, the excessive amount of floating capital has led to a distorted development of the financial industry. The establishment of banks, pawnshops, and insurance companies in the past year has been as numerous as bamboo shoots after a rain. Subsequently, the Ministry of Finance, in order to strictly manage financial institutions, specifically ordered that the establishment of financial institutions be restricted, and that no new ones be established from this year onward, except for those specially approved. However, since this spring, 13 new banks have opened, and 12 new pawnshops have opened. There are about 10 banks and 8 pawnshops currently preparing to open. The registration procedures for these newly established banks and pawnshops had already been completed, so they are not within the Ministry of Finance's order of restriction. However, this reporter from Commercial News has learned that the relevant authorities believe that the excessive number of newly established banks, pawnshops, and insurance companies may have an adverse impact on the city's finances, and that it is necessary to merge small banks, pawnshops, and insurance companies. The relevant departments are now meticulously studying a concrete plan, and once a solution is decided, it may be formally promulgated, but it will still take a considerable amount of time.</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Wishes of the Private Economic Sector</h3>
<p>The evolution of Shanghai's economy over the past year has been a magnificent spectacle, and the emerging enterprises have presented an unprecedented situation. In this era of controlled economy being implemented, entrepreneurs themselves should clearly recognize the surrounding environment in which they are situated, adapt to the trends of the times, and operate their businesses in a stable manner to achieve a rationalized position. At the same time, the government should bear in mind that without the cooperation of the private sector when implementing this planned economic policy, it will often be inefficient and difficult to achieve results. Therefore, the government also has several responsibilities:</p>
<p>First, it should expand its service scope as much as possible to supplement the shortcomings of private enterprises. Efforts should be made to construct and thoroughly improve transportation, public works, etc., such as the National Resources Committee of the United States, the National Controlled Business Committee of the United Kingdom, and the Cooperation Committee of Italy.</p>
<p>Second, it should assist enterprises, such as the Industrial Rationalization Bureau of Japan and the Production Promotion Committee of Denmark, which provide strong technical assistance from the government. Also, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation of the United States and the Rediscount and Guarantee Bureau of Germany and Belgium are characteristics of government financial assistance.</p>
<p>Third, it should protect the public, promote commercial ethics, and promote industrial safety to ensure the integrity of the economic system. For example, the quality statistics of trademarks and commodities in Europe and Japan, the regulations on fair competition and honest advertising in the United States, and the strict management of markets are all the inherent responsibilities of the government when implementing a controlled economy.</p>
<p>Regarding the above three points, it is hoped that the upper and lower levels will cooperate and work together towards the same goal, step by step, striving for effective and rational production on the one hand, and fair and rational disposal on the other. For example, under the current requirements of a wartime economy, it is necessary to quickly establish a formal market for the public trading of Chinese stocks. It is hoped that the authorities, based on the local environment and with reference to the established practices of various countries, will convene reputable representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors to jointly discuss the establishment of a formal stock market; at the same time, they should instruct the stock industry to organize a formal association to engage in the proper operation of Chinese stocks in accordance with laws and regulations, so that industrial and commercial enterprises can obtain flexible capital production and development through normal Chinese stock transactions. What great fortune this would be.</p>
<p>From another perspective, the private economic sector during wartime should understand the current situation, recognize its position, and strive to operate conscientiously and in a spirit of division of labor and cooperation. In particular, it is necessary to connect internally and externally, communicate effectively, and adjust deficits and surpluses appropriately. It should be like the snake of Changshan, responding at every joint, and like the body using its arms and the arms using its fingers, without any disconnections or defects. Then, even in any difficult environment, the emerging Chinese business community will surely stabilize its position, expand its business, and stand firmly in an unbreakable state.</p>
<h3>Uniform Purchase and Rationing of Flour in Shanghai, Suzhou, and Wuxi: Purchase Price at 85 Yuan per Bag</h3>
<p>In the Qingxiang area around Shanghai, Suzhou, and Wuxi, the flour in food will be uniformly purchased and rationed. According to investigations, the purchase and rationing methods are as follows:</p>

If the inspector still has doubts, he can conduct further inspections with the company or the agency that collects the shares.</p>

<h3>Sino-Japanese Economic Council to Hold First Meeting Soon</h3>
<p>Sino-Japanese private economic figures, in order to strengthen Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, formed the Sino-Japanese Economic Council last autumn, but it was delayed until now due to other relations. Recently, after the National Government entered the war, Sino-Japanese private economic figures increasingly need to strengthen cooperation. Therefore, the first meeting will be held soon. It is reported that those attending will include Chairman Aoki of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Managing Director Takeuchi, and other 18 people from the Japanese side, and Chairman Yuan of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and other influential economic figures from the Chinese side. They will exchange opinions on Sino-Japanese economic cooperation based on the new situation after the war. (Twenty-third Continental Daily)</p>
<h3>Hungary Experiments with Producing Tea and Coffee in Heated Greenhouses</h3>
<p>Hungarian Capital, February 21st (Haitong News Agency): Hungary is experimenting with building heated greenhouses using hot springs to produce tea and coffee. Professor Du Shang is currently leading the experimental work, and the government is providing various assistance.</p>
<h3>Rationing of Oil and Sugar per Capita to be Implemented on the 1st and 2nd: Quantities Agreed Upon, But Still Awaiting Approval</h3>
<p>After the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office and the Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office were approved by the military rationing authorities to implement rationing of oil and sugar per capita, specific measures have been decided: (1) The affairs of issuing certificates for per capita rationing in the Public Concession (including Hongkou) and the French Concession will be entrusted to the authorities of the two concessions. (2) Per capita rationing in the southwest city of Shanghai, Zhabei, and other places will be handled by the two places themselves in accordance with the Baojia system. Regarding the three major issues of the implementation date, per capita rationing quantity, and oil and sugar purchase prices in the two concessions, after negotiations between the Sugar Industry Cooperative Office, the Edible Oil Wholesale Office, the Japanese Embassy Office, the military rationing authorities, and the authorities of the two concessions, (1) The date for the per capita rationing of oil and sugar has been decided in principle, starting from March, but the certificate purchase period will be announced by the authorities at that time. (2) The quantity of per capita rationing will be determined based on the total amount approved by the military rationing authorities each month. It is reported that the approved amount for March will be set at six to eight taels, but it is still awaiting final approval by the authorities. (3) The selling price of oil and sugar will be handled in accordance with the price limit stipulated by the authorities. As for the oil and sugar needed for business operations in various industries after the implementation of per capita rationing, special rationing will be given to maintain the proper business of each industry.</p>
<h3>The Philippine Economy Has Entered a Healthy State</h3>
<p>Manila, February 21st (Allied News Agency): The Philippine economy, under the administration of the Japanese army for the past year, has reached a healthy state in both industry and agriculture. Since occupying the Philippines, the Japanese army has begun to promote Philippine production enterprises from the long-term plan of economic self-sufficiency. Recently, the production of food has increased, and the price of food has been unified. In addition, the transportation business has been restored and manufacturing factories have gradually resumed work. What is especially commendable is that a large amount of funds has been used to purchase surplus products between morning villages—especially sugar—to regulate rural finance. In addition, Japanese agricultural technology is used to increase the rice production in the Philippines, because rice is the main food of the Filipinos.</p>
<p>In addition, such items as cotton, alcohol, soap, and vegetable oil are all entrusted to the Filipinos for self-cultivation, self-production, and self-sufficiency. In addition to self-sufficiency, the surplus raw materials can also be supplied to Japan's domestic industrial manufacturing. With the natural richness of the Philippine Islands and the superiority of Japanese agricultural technology, its future is limitless.</p>
<h3>Rapid Progress of the Shanghai Rubber Industry: Rubber Shoes are the Main Manufactured Product</h3>
<p>Among the emerging industries in Shanghai that have emerged, the rubber products manufacturing industry should be the first to be promoted. Although the rubber industry does not have a long history in Shanghai's industrial history, its position in the current Shanghai industry is very important. According to reliable sources, about 60% of the rubber factories in Shanghai are currently in operation. The future of the rubber industry can be seen from the following phenomena to see the extent of its future development:</p>
<p>(1) Trade between Shanghai and various parts of Nanyang is being restored. Once this connection is restored, rubber raw materials can be smoothly and continuously imported into Shanghai to supply the manufacturing needs of various rubber factories here. It should be known that the main reason for the sluggishness of Shanghai's rubber industry in recent years is the lack of rubber raw materials.</p>
<p>(2) Since Shanghai is the center of industry and commerce in East Asia, the rubber products manufactured here will be supplied to other parts of China and other countries in East Asia. After Shanghai's industry and commerce return to normal development, there will inevitably be a wider demand for rubber products manufactured in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(3) Changes in the economic situation have increased the use of rubber. For example, the authorities here have heard that the use of leather shoes is no longer allowed, so the only alternative is rubber shoes. The second is tires, because bicycles are currently popular in Shanghai, so tires can also promote the rapid progress of the rubber industry.</p>
<p>As for the items manufactured by the rubber factories here, it is estimated that 70% of them are rubber shoes, 15% are tires, and the remaining 15% are various daily necessities, including toys.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds are Eagerly Sought: -Very Few Transactions-</h3>
<p>The market for public bonds continued to weaken yesterday, as people were slightly uneasy and more bonds were sought for sale. The initial price of Type C was around 7 yuan, down to 6 yuan, and saw a low price of 5.7 yuan, but later rose to 7 yuan, with extremely rare transactions. Type D was about 2 yuan, and Type E was about 3.5 to 3 yuan, with very few transactions. Most of the rest were not traded.</p>
<h3>Bean Cake Spot Prices Fall: Futures Market Maintains Status Quo</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market for bean cake gradually declined amid the voice of control, falling by three or four yuan compared to the previous price. The futures market was deadlocked between the bulls and bears, forming a revolving situation. It is estimated that: Yuanlong bean cake three carts, price was 117 yuan to 115 yuan, Qingzhong cake 500 pieces, price 85 yuan, Huishan cake February delivery 1,000 pieces, price 117 yuan, Li Zi cake two or three deliveries 2,000 pieces, price 117 yuan 25 cents to 117 yuan 50 cents, Xing Ji cake end of February delivery 2,000 pieces, price 119 yuan to 118 yuan 80 cents, Xing Ji and Li Zi cake March delivery 2,000 pieces, price 118 yuan 50 cents to 119 yuan, Shanghai factory cake February and March delivery 2,000 pieces, price 119 yuan to 120 yuan, Fei Zi cake one or two weeks delivery two carts, price 120 yuan 05 cents to 120 yuan. It was also heard that the Mixed Grain Group's flat-price cake of 50,000 pieces will change the delivery method in order to avoid investigation by the authorities.</p>
<h3>Candle Soap Prices Rise Endlessly: Hoarders Still Buying</h3>
<p>The market for daily necessities remains strong. As each cargo station is at its peak, new hoarders still want to buy, which leads to the endless rise in prices of each item. For example, Gu Ben soap was shouted up to a new high price of 1,000 yuan, Bai Xiang Mao soap 940 yuan, Huang Xiang Mao 880 yuan, Scissors soap 960 yuan, ten yuan more expensive than the previous day. Phoenix brand matches 5,500 yuan, Beauty brand 5,700 yuan, Golden Cauldron brand 4,300 yuan, Miscellaneous brand 3,000 yuan. White Li's wax candles 650 yuan, Monk Hat brand 540 yuan, Miscellaneous brand 400 yuan, all rising strongly.</p>
<h3>Famous Chinese and Japanese Banks to Hold Informal Meeting</h3>
<p>It is reported that in order to adapt to the new situation after the National Government entered the war and to strengthen the cooperation between Chinese and Japanese banks, powerful Chinese and Japanese banks will hold an informal meeting. The Chinese side will include major banks such as Jin Cheng, China, and Communications, and the Japanese side will include banks such as Zhengjin, Korea, Taiwan, and Mitsui. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, although the Chinese banks have moved in the direction of Sino-Japanese cooperation, the economic situation of each party has not yet reached the realm of complete cooperation. According to the exchange of deposits between Chinese and Japanese banks last year, the total amount of deposits of Japanese banks in Chinese banks was 000,000 yuan (excluding the Reserve Bank). The total amount of deposits of Chinese banks in the six major Japanese banks was also 000,000 yuan. The difference between the two sides was equal, which is equivalent to no interaction. It is extremely difficult to introduce the national capital of the Chinese side. However, after the National Government entered the war, all trade allocation, and purchases, etc., the Chinese and Japanese sides are in the same conditions. Therefore, the scope of responsibility of the Chinese financial community is also broad, which means that the contact with the Japanese banking community is expanding, and it is necessary to strengthen Sino-Japanese financial cooperation.

<h3>Recent Progress of Various Industries in Shanghai: Based on the Percentage of Operating Machines</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources in the Shanghai industrial community, as of the end of January 1943, the percentage of all machines in operation in Shanghai's various industries is as follows:</p>
<p>Type of Industry…Percentage of Machine Activity</p>
<p>Dyeing and Weaving…30%</p>
<p>Hardware…5%</p>
<p>Electrical…60%</p>
<p>Textile…65%</p>
<p>Chemical…80%</p>
<p>Printing…80%</p>
<p>Leather…45%</p>
<p>Mechanical…30%</p>
<p>Brewing…100%</p>
<p>Tobacco…100%</p>
<p>Flour…100%</p>
<p>Rubber…60%</p>
<p>From the table above, the machines of various industrial manufacturers in Shanghai that are in operation are on average from 30% to 80%. It can be seen that the industrial situation in Shanghai has made significant progress, especially the food industry. The tobacco item has also emerged, no wonder tobacco merchants have all made huge profits, and the stock prices of various tobacco companies—such as Nanyang Huacheng—have also continued to increase.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Charcoal Association Sends Personnel to Investigate Charcoal Production in Various Places</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charcoal Association had previously cut charcoal production methods last week to prevent the black market for charcoal, but the production matters must be carefully reviewed. A board meeting was held at the Japan Club on the 22nd. As a result, it was decided that Director Lin and others would lead an investigation team to conduct on-site investigations in Hangzhou, Wuhu, Chang'an, Huzhou, Jiaxing, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Zhenjiang, and Haimen.</p>
<h3>Household Medicines: No Major Fluctuations</h3>
<p>The market for household medicines is still relatively calm, and the prices have not changed much. It is estimated that: headache powder 47 yuan, Bagua Dan 50 yuan 05 cents, Wan Jin oil 58 yuan, partridge vegetables 86 yuan, Dragon and Tiger Ren Dan 47 yuan, the previous prices are quite similar.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Sales are Not Strong: Market Prices are Stable but Weak</h3>
<p>The cigarette market lacks the strength to rise, because customer sales are sluggish and the transportation is difficult. This sale is still balanced due to the supply, but fresh stomach. Therefore, the price is always stable, with very little fluctuation. It is estimated that: Great British brand 12,900 yuan, Old Knife brand 10,650 yuan, Pinhai brand 8,400 yuan, Fairy brand 8,400 yuan, Five Hua brand 7,400 yuan, Japanese cigarette Golden Gun brand 3,400 yuan, Golden Building 4,300 yuan, Red Rose 2,850 yuan, Quanlu brand 4,000 yuan, Nianxiao 3,500 yuan, Compass brand 3,400 yuan, National cigarette Pyramid 7,950 yuan, Beauty brand 7,150 yuan, Golden Mouse brand 4,400 yuan, Bai Jinlong 4,750 yuan, all the prices compared to the previous day are stable and weak.</p>
<h3>Black and White Pepper are Both Shouted Tight</h3>
<p>Recently, black pepper has become tight due to absorption, and the market has become tight again. However, the number of transactions is not much, just to embellish the market. Yesterday's settlement was about 5% higher than before. All are No. 1 pepper, the price is roughly the same, white pepper is also slightly shouted up, and the market is firm.</p>
<h3>Jinshan Branches are Expensive</h3>
<p>According to news from the Jinshan branch number, the production price is higher than the Shanghai market due to the exchange rate relationship. Therefore, the source has a temporary scarcity phenomenon. It is found that there are still many chips in the Shanghai market, so it is not easy to rise to the level of the production price for a while. However, the market is tighter, which is a real phenomenon.</p>
<h3>Huazhong Match Company to be Established on Schedule</h3>

As for the date of the third initiators meeting, it will be decided after Ban Ye Qingmin of the China Branch Revitalization Association returns to office. The general meeting is expected to be held in early March. (Twenty-third Continental Daily)</p>
<h3>The City's Second Rice Sale This Month to Begin Soon: Rationing of Two Sheng per Person</h3>
<p>The city's mid-month rice for this month has been fully allocated by the City Food Management Bureau and notified to each public rice market to pay for the rice. Therefore, the city will soon begin selling everywhere in one or two days. Each person is still required to provide two liters per ten days. It is said that the third public rice sale may increase to two and a half liters per ten days, so that the allocation of rice in the city will be more abundant.</p>
<h3>China's Nouveau Riche and Commodity Prices</h3>
<p>There is a Japanese saying called "Narikin," which is equivalent to the Chinese expression "baofu renjia" (newly rich family). In the Shanghai and Suzhou areas, it is simply called "baofahu" (nouveau riche).</p>
<p>In Japan, the term "Narikin" carries a sense of contempt, and the same is true in China, where "baofahu" are viewed as base. However, the psychological state of the "baofahu" themselves is clearly different due to the different national conditions of China and Japan. Japanese "Narikin" are very cautious, trying their best to avoid being called "Narikin" by others, so even if they truly become "Narikin," they are unwilling to reveal their "Narikin" status.</p>
<p>However, Chinese "baofahu" do not have this kind of mentality; they do not want to avoid being called "baofahu" by others. Because of this flaw, they are known as "baofahu" to others, and when relatives and friends encounter them, they ask for donations or forcibly borrow money. They are often also targeted for kidnapping, resulting in the sacrifice of huge sums of money, which is their greatest pain. As a result, by the time they want to avoid being called "baofahu," their reputation has spread far and wide, and they have no choice but to acknowledge it. They have no choice but to hire bodyguards to prevent danger, but the more they do so, the greater their reputation as "baofahu" becomes, and the more everyone knows that they are "baofahu." They are very stingy externally, but their private lives are truly unimaginable, indulging in all kinds of luxury. In China, there are not many types of "baofahu," and most of them have become rich through speculation, so they have a strong psychological inclination towards speculation. In fact, their speculative mentality, as we Japanese see it, is simply crude, but perhaps there is a great truth behind it. Perhaps it is more appropriate to say that they are "bold"! They use a very small amount of capital, and once they succeed in speculation, they become extremely wealthy. After obtaining so much cash, they naturally want to find a way to invest it in goods, considering the issue of commodity prices. If they save the cash and do not use it, and commodity prices continue to rise, wouldn't that be a loss? Therefore, they think of hoarding goods, no matter what they are, as long as they have physical goods in hand, they do not worry about any losses. Therefore, those who hoard goods are unwilling to sell them. Even if they make money by selling at the current market price, the cash they receive cannot replace the same amount of goods, so they only buy and do not sell, so that there is no loss. Generally speaking, these two mentalities are the root of becoming rich through speculation. The current rise in commodity prices in Shanghai can be said to be driven by this "speculation-to-riches" mentality. I believe this view is correct.</p>
<p>Changing the mentality of the nouveau riche in theory is one of the strategies for adjusting commodity prices and strengthening combat power. I hope that the rulers of China will consider this.

<h3>"Going in the Open" and "Coming in Secret"</h3>
<p>— Junhao</p>
<p>When beggars ask for alms, they often say "going in the open, coming in secret."</p>
<p>In fact, I think this saying has its flaws. Think about it: Giving money to help the hungry and cold is originally a righteous and generous act of kindness. However, some philanthropists are not very willing to let their names be known after giving alms. In other words, if they are willing to give alms only in the hope of being praised for their charity, then it is a bit... From this, it is clear that the phrase "going in the open" is extremely inappropriate.</p>
<p>As for "coming in secret," that is even more wrong. Think about it: How can money be obtained in secret? All money obtained without telling people honestly is either ill-gotten gains, improper gains, or unjust gains. If one earns money fairly and squarely through hard work, then one can tell people without hiding anything, why seek it secretly?</p>
<p>Therefore, the saying "going in the open, coming in secret" should be changed to "coming in the open, going in secret."</p>
<h3>A Sunday of Starvation</h3>
<p>— Mo</p>
<p>Since the distribution of rice by household registration, the school authorities, in addition to serving thin rice porridge mixed with sweet potatoes for dinner, have recently introduced a new rule that no meals will be provided at noon on Sundays, because students can go back to their relatives' and friends' homes for a hearty meal. This is originally a win-win situation. The school can save expenses, and the students can take this opportunity to enjoy a delicious meal. (Although commodity prices are high, the food at home is always better than at school.)</p>
<p>At first, I was shocked when I heard this news, because once I ran out of the school gate, I had nowhere to go, so I could rest assured that I would not be met with cold faces from relatives and friends. However, my finances are not very generous, so going to a small restaurant is out of the question. After a long period of consideration, I thought that it was only once a week, and if I didn't eat, I would only be hungry four times a month, and only forty-eight times a year, which was a small matter. It probably wouldn't affect my health, right? So I decided that I would not eat lunch every Sunday.</p>
<p>When I ate rice porridge on Sunday morning, I thought that there would be no meal at noon, so I ate one more bowl than usual. Approximately one bowl of rice porridge can last for two and a half hours without being hungry, so if I can eat four and a half bowls of rice porridge, I can last until the afternoon. What does it matter if I don't eat lunch? However, after eating three bowls, I really couldn't drink any more. Although I knew that I would definitely be hungry later, my stomach really couldn't hold any more.</p>
<p>Experience tells me that people who work too hard are prone to hunger, so after eating rice porridge, in addition to climbing a few flights of stairs from the dining hall to the dormitory, I tried my best to avoid physical activity. There were many people in the same dormitory, and in addition to reading books myself, I also chatted with them. Time always passes quickly in the hustle and bustle, and it disappears unnoticed. I didn't feel hungry at all.</p>
<p>Ding ding... the sound of the church bell ringing at noon came into my ears. I was still sitting calmly, but the students left one after another to enjoy this beautiful Sunday.</p>
<p>Only I was left in the room. In the empty atmosphere, I reflected on the strange emptiness in my stomach. I hurriedly picked up a copy of the Analects and began to hum the words of Confucius. I hadn't finished reading the Xue Er chapter when the sky became dark and it started to rain. If I were a poet, I would definitely use my inspiration to describe this misty rain, but unfortunately I am not, and I am also glad that I am not.</p>
<p>Along with the sound of the rain came the rumbling and commotion in my stomach, and I really couldn't read any more! Staring blankly at the raindrops outside, I gently comforted my stomach. Look, isn't it raining outside? Without an umbrella and rain boots, how can you go out? Isn't it very comfortable to sit at home on a rainy day like this? They must be as soaked as drowned chickens.</p>
<p>My mental comfort did not have any effect. In fact, it needed material assistance. With too much mental and psychological activity, its "deer cry" became even louder than before.</p>
<p>I put down the Analects and picked up Mencius to read. I read from Mencius's visit to King Hui of Liang to "Those who are old wear silk and eat meat, and the common people are not hungry or cold. It has never happened that one who does not do these things can rule the world." My heart was greatly comforted. Didn't Master Mencius tell us that one must be old to wear silk and eat meat, and that only the common people can be free from hunger and cold? It can be seen that young people in their twenties should go hungry. But if someone asks me why there are beggars in their seventies and eighties on the street, I think they are probably begging for silk clothes and meat, or perhaps they are still children and not old enough.</p>
<h3>Bitterness and Joy</h3>
<p>— Humin</p>
<p>Bitterness and joy, like frugality and extravagance, do not seem to have clear boundaries.</p>
<p>For a poor person, taking a rickshaw is considered extravagance; for a wealthy person, it is considered frugality, because the cost of taking a rickshaw is a considerable amount in the poor person's total expenditure; in the wealthy person's expenditure, it is a small amount.</p>
<p>Bitterness and joy are also like this. Suppose a poor scholar who has no money and worries about his daily meals will be happy if someone gives him dozens of dollars. Similarly, a wealthy person who is used to using large sums of money will feel that it is difficult to survive and extremely distressed if he only has a few dollars left.</p>
<p>Therefore, only those who have joy and no suffering in their lives do not know joy.</p>
<p>Because bitterness and joy have these characteristics, some people live in suffering without knowing it. Otherwise, people always like to enjoy happiness, so who would be silly enough to endure suffering?</p>
<p>Some people say that I have seen some people who have nothing to be happy about. Why do they willingly endure suffering?</p>
<p>Yes, there are indeed such people in the world, and only these people can be admired. Because they can find some joy in absolute suffering and use this joy to forget their stubborn suffering.</p>
<p>But their joy is not for contentment or for mental abnormality. Because contentment and mental abnormality will cause them to lose their precious future and true joy.</p>
<p>They all believe that joy will definitely follow suffering. Moreover, its arrival seems to be periodic, and it will naturally descend at a certain time. Even if they cannot enjoy it, their children and grandchildren will definitely be able to enjoy it.</p>
<p>However, on the contrary, some people think that they are "idiots looking up at the sky waiting for it to collapse." That kind of theory, that kind of fantasy, is always a theory, a fantasy, and there is no hope of realization.</p>
<p>Therefore, they enter a vortex of only immediate pleasure and no future from suffering that is indeed unbearable. Some people even engage in fratricide and murder direct relatives because they cannot enter this vortex. These people are the truly pitiful creatures who will never obtain true and lasting joy.</p>
<p>There are also some people who resent their suffering after enduring a long period of suffering and cannot wait for the arrival of joy.</p>
<p>The longer one lives a hard life, the longer the joy one will receive in the future.</p>
<p>We can also find a large number of people in novels and history who lived a hard life in their youth and later became people with property and status.</p>
<p>If they do not know how to encourage themselves and improve themselves through hardship, but only complain about heaven and earth and curry favor with the powerful, how can they have such honor and joy one day?</p>
<p>Many old and respected gentlemen have also told us that all true learning, knowledge, and experience are obtained in times of poverty and hardship, which are more extensive and practical than those obtained in times of joy, or rather, in times of wealth.</p>
<p>Therefore, let us treat this period of widespread war and suffering as the only opportunity to encourage us and improve ourselves; on the one hand, let us be more optimistic in this period of suffering and use a spirit of fearlessness to create lasting joy and lasting happiness in the future!</p>
<h3>Elementary School Teachers Under Rising Living Costs</h3>
<p>— Written by Tianming</p>
<h3>Life</h3>
<p>— Qi Wu</p>
<p>Many people often feel that they are too busy to read a book or complete a long-awaited work. But they also often feel bored and have no place to settle their minds and bodies.</p>
<p>In this contradictory psychological state, they spend their lives, silently and without a trace.</p>
<p>Therefore, as the Western proverb says, "People know that life is limited and short, but they act as if life is permanent and will not die."</p>

<h3>Model Teacher for All Ages</h3>
<p>— Written by James Hilton, translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>Sometimes, when he walked around the school, the older students would also ask him questions, just to have fun and get the "latest stuff" from Gips to sell to others.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, sir, how is the five-year plan going?"</p>
<p>"Sir, do you think Germany will fight another war?"</p>
<p>"Have you been to the new cinema, sir? I went with my family the other day. It's a big thing for a small place like Brookfield. They have a Wmrlitzer."</p>
<p>"What exactly - uh - is - a Wmrlitzer?"</p>
<p>"It's an organ, sir - a cinema organ."</p>
<p>"Oh... I've seen that name at the - uh - cinema, but I've always - uh - suspected - it must be some kind of - uh - sausage."</p>
<p>Laughter. …Oh, this is Gips's new joke, friends, a completely lovely joke. I was talking to the old boy about the new cinema, and so……</p>
<p>In November 1933, one afternoon, he sat in the front room of his room in Mrs. Wiggott's house. It was cold and foggy, and he didn't dare to go out. He hadn't been very well since Armistice Day; he thought he might have caught a slight cold during the service. Mouriefield had come by that morning for his usual fortnightly chat. "Everything's all right, though? Feeling fine? That's right - good to stay indoors in this weather - there's a cold going around. Hope I'll hear your life finished in a day or two."</p>
<p>His life… what a life it was! As he sat by the fire that afternoon, the whole of his life unfolded before him. The things he had done and seen; Cambridge in the 1860s; the big hill one morning in August; Brookfield, at every moment, through all the years. As for life, there were also the things he had not done, and things he had only recently noticed and now would never do - such as he had never flown in an airplane, and he had never seen a talkie. Thus he was in some ways more experienced and in some ways less experienced than the youngest new boy at the school; and this mixture of old and young was what the world called progress. (45)</p>
<h3>Honesty</h3>
<p>— Jingtai</p>
<p>In this society of mutual deception, everything we see in human affairs is mostly covered with a coat of deception. And the habits of ordinary people are so easy to tell false words and do false deeds. Therefore, it makes people feel that this world is too ugly.</p>
<p>A person can, at most, be honest with a few close friends and relatives; otherwise, he has to deal with things by means of hypocrisy and deception, depending on the time and place. However, in any case, a person who is honest can always win people's respect and joy; on the contrary, he will arouse people's aversion and contempt.</p>
<p>Honesty is indeed a person's greatest treasure. Because a person is honest, even if his life is poor and his position is humble, his kind of personality beauty will always shine, making people admire him.</p>
<p>How should we define honesty? For example, if a doctor says to a patient who has no hope of life: "You are dying." Is this appropriate? If the doctor says to the patient: "Your illness is getting better, you can rest assured and recuperate." Then, can we criticize the doctor for saying these dishonest words? Of course, in human nature, we all support the doctor using the latter method to comfort the patient. In the complex human society, there are countless such things; therefore, the more appropriate explanation of honesty is: based on the principle of good intentions, the method of expression is not absolute.</p>
<p>The famous Greek philosopher Socrates was mocked by the common people as a madman because he was honest. However, for thousands of years, people have been praising and yearning for this honest madman!</p>
<p>Honesty is truly the most beautiful treasure in life.</p>
<p>When all sounds are quiet, let us ask ourselves: Are we honest with others and with ourselves, in words, deeds, thoughts, and beliefs? Or not? (Excerpt from a speech by Mr. Gu Zhengshu of the Youth Association on February 14)</p>

<h3>Expressing the Spirit of Mutual Assistance: Various Hospitals Treat Elementary School Teachers</h3>
<p>(1) Dr. Zhang Xiqi, Director of Guanghua Eye Hospital, in response to the newspaper's medical aid fund for elementary school teachers, stipulates that from now on, he will provide free diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases for male and female elementary school teachers. The teachers who receive treatment must present a certificate from the school. The first branch of Guanghua Eye Hospital is located at No. 26, Wermond Road, French Concession (intersection of Kaiser Road), and the second branch is located at No. 808, Gordon Road, Public Concession (intersection of Haiphong Road). Time: 10:00 to 11:00 am and 5:00 to 6:00 pm every day, closed on Sundays.</p>
<p>(2) Dr. Zhang Youmin, Director of Youmin Hospital, yesterday gave the newspaper ten health vouchers, totaling fifty sheets, for distribution to elementary school teachers, so that the teachers can take the vouchers to the hospital for free diagnosis and treatment. The hospital is located at No. 361-3, Mintini Yin Road, French Concession.</p>
<h3>Free School Directory</h3>
<p>(1) The Private Zhicheng Compulsory Night School at No. 29, Dazhong Lane, Tongfu Road, has two levels of high school (grades 1 and 2), three levels of junior high school, and one level of junior high school preparatory class this semester. Each level has 40 students, and tuition and fees are waived. Registration is from 6:00 pm to 9:00 pm, and the examination will be on March 1.</p>
<p>(2) Huimin Compulsory Tutoring School still has vacancies in the two levels of high school. All poor and out-of-school children, regardless of gender, can apply for admission. The school is located at No. 59, Xiaopi Street, Anren Street, Nanshi.</p>
<h3>TB Prevention Association Donates Slogans</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Tuberculosis Prevention Movement Committee, in response to the authorities' ban on spitting, in order to reduce the spread of lung disease, has specially printed and donated TB prevention slogans for use by various companies and businesses. Those who need them can attach four cents of postage and send a letter to the association at Room 307, Meiqi Building, No. 996, Jing'an Temple Road to obtain them. In addition, in order to expand the protection of lung diseases and popularize early treatment, the association will carry out large-scale X-ray examinations from now on. Those who are found to have lung disease will be assisted by the association in getting air injections to reduce the burden on the citizens.</p>
<h3>Repairing the Mituo Temple Church</h3>
<p>(Letter) Last winter, the border between Anhui and Hubei provinces was suddenly hit by war, and the Taihu Mituo Temple area was the first to bear the brunt. The entire town and four villages were turned into scorched earth, and most of the church was also burned down. Now, it is planned to slightly repair it as a place for missionaries to live and for church members to worship. In addition to applying for an allocation of funds, I also ask our enthusiastic church members to generously donate to jointly accomplish this great undertaking. Please send donations to Father Wei of the Yangjingbang Catholic Church in Shanghai to be forwarded to Father Yang Di of the Anqing Diocese. Sincerely, Yang Di.</p>
