<p>社評</p>
<h3>紗布收買以後怎樣？</h3>
<p>此次政府收買棉紗布並補辦登記，規定截止日期後，絕對不再展限。同時，紗布持有者，亦均能依限辦理，不事觀望。政府這種堅決的態度，以及社會對於政府合作的精神，都很値得稱贊。現在去截止申請和登記的日期，雖不過短短十餘日，而人民對於紗布分配辦法的實現，却早已如大旱之望雲霓。第一是消費者方面，秋風巳起，大家正是添製寒衣的時候，可是添製寒衣的材料，走遍市區，却無購處，尤其是婚喪之家以及姙婦方面，需要更爲迫切。第二是零賣布店方面，在申請截止以前，各布店均已停止營業，迄今時逾半月，收入毫無，開支如故，這種情况當然很難繼續維持。第三是工廠方面，因原料的無從取給，傳不得不停工。可是停工以後，一切開支仍不能省，其困難情形與零售商店正復相同。我們很了解整理申請和登記的工作異當繁重，也知道創作一種新的配給辦法，必須經過多番縝密考量。不過另一方面却不能不盼望常局也顧到社會上的普遍困難情形，極力矯正過去一般機關辦事迂緩的通病。能早一日公佈，即早一日解除普遍的困難情形。更希望在公佈以前，能先將一切手續都準備齊全，勿使公佈是一事，實行又是一事。米糧聯營社接辦配給戶口米時的情形，就是一個很不好的前例。總願此次不至再蹈覆敵。</p>
<p>在紗布配給辦法尙未公佈以前，我們綜合各方意見，貢獻幾項原則：</p>
<p>節衣縮食，是戰時的天經地義，人民都已明瞭。而且戰時一般人民的購買力，也無形中等於一種自然的限制。可是最低限度的需要，是絕對無法避免的。要使配給的辦法能澈底，先須配給數量能合理。否則一方面爲滿足生活需要，一方面爲供給此種需要，黑市依然無法消滅。以米糧的配給情形而言，施行計口授糧辦法，何嘗不是想消滅黑市，可是黑市米的存在，到現在已成爲公開秘密。上海數百萬的巿民，（包括各機關的各級公務人員在內）誰不是黑市米的主顧？馬路上成千成百的米販絡繹不絕，糧食機關當然也能見到的。其原因就由於配給的數量和實際需要數量相差太遠。從人情方面言，便不能不採取放任的方法，但是配給食糧的意義，却已根木失去；政府威信，也不能亳無影響。衣食對於人民生活同一重要，食糧配給旣已發生不良現象於前，在擬訂紗布配給辦法時，便當引爲殷鑒。因此紗布配給數量，就更値得愼重考慮。</p>
<p>政府收買棉紗布的目的，是爲的取締國積，平抑物價，安定民主。在這種塲合，對於紗布的配給價格，便不應該與收買價格相差太遠。最要緊的，政府辦理這件事絲亳不應含有財政作用。換一句話，就是不可因以為利。</p>
<p>棉紗布之配給，其用途無論屬於製造加工，抑屬於消費，在配給程序中所經過之層次，總以愈少愈好。蓋屋次多，則手續繁，時間久，費用大，最後受配給者，即不免須受時間上與經濟上兩重損失。吾人理想中之配給程序如次：</p>
<p>商統會——聯合會——各種同業公會　製造加工者　零售商——消費者</p>
<p>以上假想程序，仍不免遷就商統會現行組織系統，其中聯合會一級，如能省去，則辦事更可敏捷。在配給制度中，批發商是多餘的，分利的，實無存在必要。所以我們主張毅然取消，為减輕消費者負担起見，在擬訂配給辦法時頗値加以硏究。</p>
<p>此次政府收買棉紗布，其付款辦法，係黃金與存單各半，但均須經過相當時期後始行分批付給。配給辦法實施後，倘規定以現款出貨，則商人勢必紛紛另籌一筆資金，其困難可想到者，一爲貸款不易，二爲利息太高。前者還不過是商人本身問題，後者更不免加重消費者的負担。我們建議政府可以責成商人提也相當保證，以先貨後款辦法配給紗布，如此在規定商人利潤中，可以减去利息一項，嘉惠人民，實非淺鮮。</p>
<p>消費用棉紗布之配給，必須與戶口米一例辦理，絕對採用配給劵制度，以免零售商從中上下其手。</p>
<p>關於紗布配給辦法，我們所要貢獻的意見如上。此外，對於收買方面也還于有幾點意見：</p>
<p>收買價格之一部份，以黃金支付，巳見政府明令，常然不至變更。不過戰時各國通例，黃金白銀都屬國有，從前「租界」當局對於標金買賣也會禁止，至今尙求公開解禁。現在政府旣規定以黃金為收買棉紗布之代價，事實上即已承認人民可以自由持有携帶買賣，不過人民方面對於此點尙多未能明瞭，宜即另頒命令，明白宣示。</p>
<p>棉紗布經政府收買後，即成爲國家之財產，儲存方面，應加特別注意，蓋紗布性質，一經潮顯蒸發，即變腐朽，甚至完全無用。在此戰時生產匪易，物力維艱之際，對於任何物資，都不能不格外珍重愛惜，何况紗布是民生日用必需品。過去各機關對於儲存公物，不甚措意，動輙發生重大損失。我們有鑒於以往種種情形，所以特別提出，希望常局加以重視。</p>
<p>此次收買棉紗布之總値，即照收買價格計算，亦在國幣六十萬萬元以上。除了儲藏方面應當特別注意外，對於監管方面，似亦不容忽視。爲示信於人民起見，應由政府組織檢查委員會，聘任各界公正人士，担任檢査委員，按期檢査，公開報吿。</p>
<p>上海的民食問題日趨嚴重，今年華中各地稻穀豐收，論理不應有此現象，其癥結所在，當為農民心理重視實物，不肯盡量糶出存粟所致。亟應因勢利導，輸出大量紗布，換取米麥雜糧，以解決都巿之民食問題。</p>

<h3>旅華日本僑民　服從我國稅法　自十月一日起實施</h3>

<h3>越南工業現狀</h3>
<p>越南自給體制，正由經濟各部門積極推進，越南原富於農林原料，其當前之最大問題，即在如何急速實現工業化，此問題實際上雖有種種困難，但經日本以技術資材與資本等援助，當可逐漸解決，付諸實現。故越南方面，對日本之期待頗殷、茲就目前越南之工業現狀，聽之如次：</p>
<p>精米工業</p>
<p>以堤岸爲中心之　　精米工業，每日出米量，已顯示相當之大，其精米機械之增設及修理問題，因日方之協力，故不久當可完全解決。</p>
<p>代用燃料工業</p>
<p>代用石油之酒精工業，頃正從事大規模製造，其他機械用　油潤滑油等製造工業，亦以篦麻子油花生油魚油等充原從事製造中。</p>
<p>化學工業</p>
<p>越南化學工業，戰前幾等於無，後受戰爭之影響，現已有小規模從事作業，惟因原料須仰賴輸入故，仍未脫離試騐時期，製品為炭化石炭，及黑色火藥苛性鹽酸甘油硬脂酸等，但其中之黑色火藥，乃用炸砲山之物，故相當重要。</p>
<p>建築材料製造工業洋灰爲越南建築材料豐造工業唯一重要者，如越南洋灰公司，每日可產數噸，規模相當龐大，近更因技術顯　進步，故生產成績允爲良好，至於煉瓦之生產，亦因需要激增而增强，惟形成機械化製造工業，實爲當前最大急務。</p>
<p>織　工業</p>
<p>最近特別顯著之傾向，即本地大量生產之絲棉等織維之活用，已由積檢硏究時代，進全實騐時代，某地附近之法人紡織工廠，已完全近代化。如能確保原料，則可於各種工業中，估最活潑之地位。</p>
<p>造紙業</p>
<p>印度支那造紙公司，乃越南惟一之造紙　者，惟其生產量，至今僅能應所需之十分之一，當局有鑒及此，乃獎勵家庭造紙工業，當地之報紙，概皆由家　造紙工業者所供給，及今更決定由日輸入，並開始　接造紙，因此越南之用紙間題，當可早日解決。</p>
<p>皮革工業</p>
<p>越南本擁有豐富之皮革原料，惟因　酸缺乏，致使皮革製品難於製成，邇來鑒於鞣酸之重要性，積極實施增產，故預料製革之障害，不久即可除去。</p>
<p>橡皮工業</p>
<p>越南雖擁有年產若干噸以上之橡膠資源，但製品業屬簡單，僅限於水枕三輪車胎等，至於汽車車胎，則始終不能製造，且因此種物品輸入激减，故目前越南橡膠界之重點，已置於汽車胎　及其他橡膠製品之積極硏究，又三輪軍現於越南爲重要交通工具，故亦須積極增產。</p>
<h3>東綫德軍武器　發揮驚人效果　造成防禦戰完全勝利</h3>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電　德國新聞社訉：斯摩倫斯克通至莫斯科公路之南與北、德軍之武器在星期六之戰事中，再度造成防禦上之完全勝利。該處蘇軍以後備生力軍，沿廣闊之前綫加入作戰，此等後備兵在强大之主力機隊掩護下，迭次向德軍陣地進攻，隨即展開劇烈而暫時各有進退之戰事，但結果德軍陣綫仍堅固如前，德軍之自動武器發揮驚人之效果，蘇軍損失甚重。</p>
<p>宛如洪爐</p>
<p>兩供應公路間附近地區之情形亦類是，該處戰事繼續竟日緊張之程度不减於前，敵軍之大舉進攻，不斷獲得來自耶爾尼亞（Yalnya）杜羅高菩許（Dorogobush）與耶爾瑞伏、（Yartzevo）等區生力軍之接濟，全部戰區形似魔術士之洪爐　但隊軍雖大舉進攻，而德軍之陣綫則各據　均未動搖，敵軍坦克車之損失亦無法估計。羅斯拉夫爾（Roslavl）之西南蘇軍增調步兵生力軍數師團與强大之坦克軍隊，敵軍在德軍陣地擊破深長之缺口教處。</p>
<p>縮短陣綫</p>
<p>結果使德軍在該地區之陣綫，不得不予以縮短，但德軍之移動秩序井然，且不斷與敵單且戰且走。近黃昏時，强大之德主力機隊攻破該據點之蘇軍之打擊力，使地上之德軍獲得不少解救，而千蘇軍以重大之損失。蘇軍雖突破德軍之陣綫，　立即爲德匈之步兵所切斷，而使敵軍猛攻之效果被抵消。</p>
<p>擊退攻勢</p>
<p>東綫北部除列寗格勒區之外，星期六日之情形仍平靜，僅伊爾門鋒之活動。蘇軍以步兵數團與坦克車數隊之實力，再度由列寗格勒德軍包圍圈之東壁屢次進攻，敵之目的在於襲取斯尼亞維諾（Sniavino）高地區之德軍陣地，德軍在苦戰中擊退蘇軍之進攻。</p>
<p>續向西移</p>
<p>唐納資與聶柏河之間，德軍在强大之後防隊何護下，繼續向西移撤，蘇軍於星期六日再度企圖迫逐向預定陣她撤退之德軍，其時德軍突然反攻，蘇軍猝不及防，損失甚大，甚至在若干處蘇軍不得不後退。蘇車因誤料德軍敗退，以致不得不付出重大之代價。</p>
<p>南路劇戰</p>
<p>巴夫洛格勒（Pavlograb）開劇烈之肉搏戰，蘇軍作成局部突被數處，但德軍切斷敵軍之聯絡，以扺抗　突破之效力，德軍主　戰綫之地位屹然不動。卡利夫之西，蘇軍進攻被擊散，德後防軍予敵以不小之損失，卡科失之西北德空軍協助地上德軍作戰甚爲得手，蘇軍以强大之坦克車與步兵隊企圖切斷德軍後方之連絡。烏台（Ubal）區發生　戰，蘇軍毫無成功，損失坦克車甚多。庫彭橋頭區天氣情形已進步，蘇軍在庫彭河之雨以大批坦克車迭次進攻，終於未逞。</p>
<h3>威爾斯將任　美駐蘇大使　斯丹萊已返國</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十日中央社電　據莫斯科消息，美國駐蘇大使斯丹萊，已離莫斯科返華盛頓，與維斯福總統會商，關於會商之詳情，莫斯科之美大使館方面尙無發表。同時德國新聞社引華盛頓消息　：最近辭去副國務卿戰務之威爾斯，將　斯丹萊，　將任駐　人使。</p>
<h3>蘇駐瑞典　女公使昇格</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十日中央社電　蘇聯駐瑞典女公使　　丹夫人，頃向路透社代表證實　已被　爲女大使職。　並稱此項　　，僅為　　政府對其功德之一種認識，而予以一種光榮。科夫人雖已昇格為大使，惟公使館仍照舊，並未升級爲大使館。</p>

<h3>德軍司令　向義農工呼籲</h3>
<p>米蘭十九日中央社電　義大利中部德軍總司令　塞林元帥，今晚向義大利之工業工人及農工呼　，要求彼等以自由工人之資格赴德，襄助進行德義之共同戰爭，該呼關係　向義境佔領區全部發出</p>
<h3>塞爾維亞首相　謁見希特勒　商談東南歐新局勢</h3>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電　據正式公佈：希特勒元首昨於行營接見塞爾維亞首相奈狄煦，在此次接見之前，塞爾維亞領袖亦曾與德外長里賓特洛甫長談，討論塞爾維亞之政策。</p>
<p>柏林廿日中央社電　德外長里　特洛甫曾在元首行營與塞爾維亞首相奈狄煦作長時間會談終了後，該首相並謁見希特勒元首，此次會談因關係德國對巴爾幹採取之新政策，實有重大意義。蓋義國對巴爾幹半島科四嘉島法國南部常有强砥之領土要求，對此次德國之建設歐洲新秩序，實不無妨碍。現要求領土之義王室，實際上已行　替，故德國政府途仿傚日本建設東亞新秩序之政策，亦對巴爾幹各國實施新政策。德國新聞社外交記者頃對塞爾維亞首相此次訪問元首行管事報道稱，塞爾維亞首相此次訪謁元首，殊堪注目，義國王室之態度不僅妨害西南歐各懸案之解決，且對於各該國與德國間之關係亦有相當阻碍。自南斯拉夫崩潰以來，塞爾維亞之地位如何，雖尙未解決，但德國政府爲滿意塞爾維亞首相等協力之態度，即問題之順利決，可毫無問題。常此英美在南南歐對蘇聯作極大讓步之情勢下，巴爾幹各國捨與德國協力外，實無他途，　西南歐各國要人當認淸此點。</p>
<h3>墨索里尼仍留德　民軍總司令向令袖表示効忠</h3>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電　德元首營十九發表：墨索里尼統帥於被救後，即赴德元首行營與希特勒會見，已歷時數日。</p>
<p>羅馬二十日中央社電　羅馬無綫電昨晚報吿：法西斯軍團司令里克西中將於就職後，曾致電墨索里尼，保證効忠及服從。</p>
<h3>德國戰力的分析（二）</h3>
<p>— 池崎忠孝</p>
<p>糧食供給德不及蘇</p>
<p>在食糧問題上，蘇聯的自給力，亦不能較德國優越。我敢說，現在蘇聯的攻勢，乃是因爲蘇聯的食糧問題，不能忽視烏克蘭的收復。卽以冷靜如冰的史太林而言，雖明知陷於德國出血戰術的陷阱中，但卒不能不在其誘導的防禦戰術之前，消耗大量的武器與兵力。</p>
<p>戰前德國的食糧自給率，大體在八成以上。如再加上食糧輸出國的羅馬尼亞及保加利亞，並歐洲的穀食烏克蘭，則在食糧自給之點上，德國的地位，遠較普通一般人所想的爲優俗。而且有三百萬俘虜被配置於農村，利用於荒地墾闢，以出產食糧。所以從令日說來，前次大戰中獲有寳貴的經騐的德國，不致於重蹈覆轍、</p>
<p>反之，蘇聯的食糧自給力，在戰前雖有百分之百的良好成績，那是在確保歐洲穀會烏克蘭時代的悄形。從　喪失之後說來，確已極形困窘。據東部占領地長官羅森倍克的說明烏克蘭的播種面積，擴充至在蘇聯統治時之上。據說烏克關本年特別豐收，這使德蘇在食糧問題上的地位，愈趨懸殊。</p>
<p>臥薪嘗胆埋頭苦幹</p>
<p>第四，說到耐受戰爭的犧牲和恐怖的國民精神力，蘇聯亦終非德國之敵。兩國的歷史，對這點與以明確的答復。試回顧三卞年戰爭及七年戰爭時的德國人。這二次戰爭中，德國人雖處於慘淡的苦患之下，但證明其具有世界無比的忍耐力，且告訴我們，他們常用其無比的忍耐力，打開自己的運命。</p>
<p>尤以此次戰爭如遭敗衂以後的德國，所將遭逢的命運，德國人本身較任何人知道得明白。最近讀賣報知的柏林特電，叙述目前德國人的心境說，德國全境充滿着臥薪嘗胆的精神、埋頭苦幹。</p>
<p>那麽蘇聯對這點如何呢？斯拉夫民族的歷史，告訴我們在克里米戰役中，塞伐斯托波利的失陷，立卽使俄羅斯的戰意爲之挫折。在日俄之戰中，奉天會戰及日本海海戰，使當時的俄羅斯，發生再繼續戰爭爲徒然的觀念。拿破崙戰爭中俄羅斯的强靱，可視爲斯拉夫民族上的一個例外。</p>
<p>我並不把史太林統治下的斯拉夫民旅與以前的同樣看待，但我們常覺得，潛存於民族性報　中之永遠的素質，終非一朝一夕所能變更</p>
<p>英美雙方綜合戰力</p>
<p>因上述理山，故單把歐洲戰爭當作德蘇戰爭，德國有七分的勝算，蘇聯的地位決不容樂觀。所以推測今後歐洲戰局最重要的一點，即爲英美的綜合戰力，能補充蘇聯的脆弱性至何種程度。若英美的綜合戰力補充蘇聯的脆弱性而尙有餘力，則歐洲戰局的推移對德國當然不利。</p>
<p>英美的綜合戰力，不足以直接威脅德國之戰略的地位，因其存在於歐洲要塞之外，無論共如何龐大，沒有足以補足蘇聯脆弱性的資格。熟　其中機妙的史太林，自一九四二年春以來，不絕對英美要求第二戰綫，自屬當然。</p>
<p>在這意義上，蒙高茂萊軍之在加拉普里亞登陸，有着很重大的意義。今後戰局如何發展，自不容預測，假定軸心軍在防禦上未能奏效，義國全境完全落於反軸心軍之手時，德國在這最惡劣的狀態下，又將如何呢？</p>
<p>一部份英美的論者說，義國全境的制壓，決不能制德國的死命，德國反因此而節省兵力，節省資材，並且把有力的一部　軍收作自己的羽翼，及依然能夠利用多數勞働者，所以這時候德國的地位，亳無悲觀的理由。</p>
<p>論調，當然可視為英美方面的宣傳策略，不容輕予信任。但縱令這是宣傳策略，在這種論調的背後，也存有若千眞理，單把這當作宣傳策略而置之，決非聰明的態度。因爲據當前的戰理與事實，曾在義國全境喪失後，德國的戰略地位，仍　當鞏固。</p>
<p>從戰略上看『與其把義人利半點視作歐洲要塞的一部，毋寗視之爲突出陣地之一。在防衛歐洲要塞上，隨時有被切離的可能。二者之間，有着阿爾卑斯山的天險，由於過去的歷史，不僅證明這是不能飛波的險地，即山岳戰的理論家法蘭茲佛賴海爾庫思亦已加以詳盡說明</p>
<p>反軸心軍難破天險</p>
<p>假使精銳的德軍，據此山地的險要而遮斷反軸心軍北進之路，他很能夠以一對六或一對七的數字而完成共目的。反軸心軍即欲敢於突破這天險，隨地有重演阿拉貢悲劇的司能。　聯把反軸心軍的加拉普里亞登陸當作第一義的，不認爲即係所謂第二戰棧的形成，決不是沒有理由的。</p>
<p>德國的最高統帥部，或許早已預期有此，在萬一的塲合，據阿爾卑斯山地的險要，徐徐地制禦敵的攻勢。所以英美方而以爲如欲現實地對德加以當頭棒擊，與以致命的打擊，他們不以攻略義大利半島即告滿足，且須進而直衝歐洲要塞，除對此實施大規模的登陸戰以外。別無他方法。</p>
<p>歐洲登陸困難重重</p>
<p>然而反軸心軍的歐洲登陸戰，在運輪問題上遭遇了不可解決的雖題。聞戰以來，英美方面，業已喪失了三千萬噸以上的船舶。如其考慮到一面須防備東亞的戰局，他面須不斷的補充義國登陸軍，則歐洲登陸戰上所需要的大量兵力，及運輸一切戰爭資材的船腹，將如何籌集呢？</p>
<p>徵之前次大戰，美軍遠征歐洲所需要的船腹，每一名兵士約十七噸半。從現在遠比當時機甲化的狀况看來，假定從美國派遣一百萬兵士到歐洲，最少限度需要二千萬噸以上的船腹·英美在奎貝克會商的內容，被蘇聯報紙一言道破說：選擇沒有德軍的處所登陸，因此，其目的在於大家所一時不注意的地方，否則他們恐怕斷不會作這種冒險</p>
<p>東綫德軍深謀遠慮</p>
<p>東部戰綫德軍的作戰，至少有着二個目的。一面，用撤退戰略引誘蘇聯軍的攻擊，委棄寸土，而換得　大的犧牲，同時因其撤退　徐徐地縮短戰綫，擬儘量節約兵力用以應付英美的第二戰綫。據稱僅奧萊爾變曲陣地的修正，德軍已能節約二十個師團的兵力，我不禁十分讚佩德軍的深謀遠慮。</p>
<p>所以扮演一九一八年　登首夫攻勢的角色者顯然不是現在的德軍而是蘇聯軍。單在奥萊爾一地，德軍所獲的戰果，計達戰車五千五百十四輛，砲八百五十四門，飛機二千一百十九架。這種意外消耗的結果。或許隨時誘發蘇聯的死滅，在英美的第二戰錢開闢以前，蘇聯報紙大呼蘇聯有立即瀕於危機之虞。從這論調中可以充分察知前面所說的情形。</p>
<p>在蘇聯脫離之後的英美的地位，早已沒有多說的必要。他們深感到爲了他們的勝利上，蘇是怎樣的重要。泰晤士計　案中說，在將凍的世界之計劃上，無論如何須得蘇聯的協力，最婉曲地表示了這種感情。最近　浦金的聲明，更北直地告訴出來。從此點來說，去年的斯達林松勒，並不是德軍的色當，同樣，希特勒的必勝信念，亦尙未至當作迷信而付之一笑的時期，這對現在的英美，究有何種意義。（完）（翔：譯自九月九日東京讀賣報知）</p>

<h3>有獎儲蓄週</h3>
<p>中央備　銀行爲　動人民儲蓄，使一般游資　　於銀行起見，特於本月十五日　至二十二日止，舉行有獎儲蓄週，　動本市銀行　同業公會會員銀行一百六十家，全體參加辦理，籍以吸收定期存款，其意義不可謂不深長。</p>
<p>儲蓄之種類甚多，惟大致不外三種，即强制儲蓄，自由儲蓄，與有獎儲蓄。強制儲蓄，在我國目前狀態下，縣然不易舉辦；自由儲蓄，在我國目前狀態下，似乎鮮有成續·惟有獎儲蓄。似尙可行，因此，今年六月下句，在京舉行之全國經濟委員會第二次全體會議·即言通過「獎勵人民儲蓄以適應戰時經濟　一案；此次中央儲備銀行之督　全滬銀行舉行「有獎儲蓄週」蓋巳逮到此案之實施階段了。</p>
<p>戰時人心浮動，重物輕幣，淡於儲蓄，非有壓力或重嘗，此風不易轉變。今茲政府於強制收買紗布而後，　以有獎定期儲蓄，重賞之下，民風可變，預卜銀行定期儲存之增加，市面游資數　之收縮，當成爲「有獎儲蓄　』之天然收　。</p>

<p>中儲銀行策動本市全體會員銀行一百六十余家參加舉辦之儲蓄週，自本月寸五日起實施以來，商民參加儲蓄者極形踴躅、因該項定期儲蓄存款，期問短少，利息優厚，且有搖彩得獎之機會，是以各商民都　於儲蓄，現以儲蓄週期限明（廿二）日下午四時即行截止，故近日各銀行接受儲蓄戶頭，尤爲熱鬧，</p>

<h3>日僑將照中國稅法　正式納稅　日總領署當局發表談話</h3>
<p>中央社滬訉國民政府根據七月底中日兩國間締結關於對日本國臣民課稅之條約前進行準備，擬對日本國臣民實施　稅。朮月卞日國民政府對谷大使　出第一次通知，明示對在華日僑適用中　稅法之範圍及滴用時期等。上海日本總領事　當　特於二十日發表談話。就將近課徵之稅目予以解說，並希　日　對國府之課稅我自動協力。依照七月</p>
<p>談話</p>
<p>依照七月三十一日補結關於對留居中華民國之日本國臣民　稅條約之附屬協定第一條規定，關於日本國臣民所應　揗中華民國法令之範圍及適用地域之羣一次通報，業於本刀十日由國府外交部長交付駐華帝國特命全權大使，一如告示所明示，數於二十日之中日兩國官報中揭載，至此，在華日本　臣民即將開始依　中國稅法正式　稅。</p>
<p>日本國臣民遵循中國民國之　稅法令尙屬創舉，此固不待　者且此次措　在較　時日內將即付褚實施·故不難想像將因不諳稅法內容及納稅手續而感到某種程度之不便與困難，然日本帝國撤發在巾華民國之治外法權，援助中國早日完成自主的發展，互相提携，以擔仟開放大束亞與建設新秩序之堅固決意勇往邁進。關於課稅之此次措置亦不外乎目體實　此種方針，因之　否能圓滑實施於日本對華國策之推進上極有重大意義存在，故望各位僑民深切認識當前　勢，即有若干不便與困難，亦應以自勸協力之精神，予以克服，充分滴應劃時代的新事態，服從國策，俾對建　大東亞及　遂戰爭右所貨獻。</p>
<p>又　於開始納稅時當地僑民應特別注意各點略加說明如次，故宣參照前次發表之條約，附屬協定，說解事項，以及此次通報內容，庶不致有誤。</p>
<p>對於上海日總領事館所轄關係稅目</p>
<p>此次第一次通報中列舉之稅目，爲除所得稅以外之全部中央稅（蒙　作別論）及一部份地方稅，但僅在華北及蒙疆方面實施之稅法亦全部列入通報中，其中屬平總領事稅所轄者，對於中央稅記明「華化中南」「華中南」「華中」「華中七省」及「全國」等適用地域。對於地方稅除明示僅適肜於蒙疆地域者以外之五種類，均係適用本總領事館　區者，但單記明江蘇省而未列入上海特別市者則不適用於上海市，此點尤須注意。</p>
<p>又除　　稅外各稅均定自十月一日起實施，　於各稅之內容，在二十日南京當局發表之「稅法　說」中揭載，其　要宜加熟讀。</p>
<p>關於此次通知未記載之稅目</p>
<p>在此次通報中未予列入之稅目中，其與一般　民有深切關係老爲所得稅，　業稅，土地稅，家屋稅，飮食稅，及觀管稅等，對於此種稅目在未開徵之前，應有某種準備，或採取特別措置，一俟獲得解決，常即發出第二次第三次通知，但中國當局刻正充分理解僑民之立塲，愼重硏究實施最適當之方法，故各位僑民母庸　任何不安，靜待將有正式通如後再行善處。</p>
<p>又在此次未列入通報而過去事實上已在納付者，則秉協力中國方面之主旨，仍以原右名目與方法應予納付。又與稅類似之名稱而其具有手續費性質者，則與通知無關，日本人亦當納付，此固不待論</p>
<p>對於中國方面之強制力</p>
<p>依照諒解事項第二條，規定中國方而暫時不採用強制力之行政處分，故　如中國官意之臨檢檢査扣押及拍　等强制執行及沒收等之强制行爲，暫時當不予採用，然對於査　簿及要求納稅義務人申請或作說明等徵稅　術上不可缺少之事項，中國官　如有要求時，則宜加留意。</p>
<p>關於確保日人納稅之措置</p>
<p>如上述中國方面規定不里強制力，故日本方面爲　保日人納稅採取必要　　，此點在諒解事項第三　中規定，以爲補救政第因之　預料將公布規定罰　之省令，但臨時之措置，如有違反　稅法，漏稅延宕等事實時。本總領事館抹取行政處分適當處置之方針，但爲保持帝國臣民之名　，各宜自重，俾小必要此種措置。此次通知之稅</p>
<p>與民團稅之關係</p>
<p>此次通知之稅目中，與現行上海居留　團稅重複者，僅為酒類稅，酒稅在中國方面之稅奉頗高，故現在參照與民團稅重額課征後一般日人負擔增加，以及民團財政精形，考慮調整方法，對於其他民　稅在未有通報，中國方面有同額課稅之前，仍照現狀實施要之，對於民團稅調整必須從二方面着想，即一　免因二重課稅而日人負扣增加，一在維持不使民團　業經營發生障礙之　人　但中國方面對民團事業亦充分諒解，故對民團財政上引起障碍之方法當不採取也。</p>
<p>舊租界地域之關係</p>
<p>在此次通躲列入之稅目中，中央稅不聞舊租界內外均須踩徵，但對地方稅，在舊公共租界及其　界築路以及舊法租界地域，當然不適用，關於適用上項，地域之稅法，將再加　改後，再行通知，故居住於該地域之僑民，應依照八月一日本總領事館告示所指示·以舊工部局或舊公董局之賦課金充作捐款繼續繳納。又關於中國課稅問題如有不明事項及疑義之點，則儘景要求本總領事館關係官加以說明。</p>

<h3>少年飛行兵的訓練　美麗的神之子</h3>
<p>世上有無限的美，美的中間，有少年飛行兵的姿態。這種美，是妙在「簡單　素之美」………有此感想者，不僅是我一個人吧！</p>
<p>全身穿上飛行服的少年們的姿態，看不出一些虛飾的　東。僅是適宜於空中飛行的褐色制服與　子，綠色的帶形降落傘，不中用的東西，一樣都沒有。</p>
<p>對於這個簡素而又美的少年飛行兵，我們祗　得他的威儀氣無，又具備着天然的美。</p>
<p>除了一切外觀的美，關於那些少年們的精神的美，祇要他們南征北戰的壯烈無比之戰鬥情形，就可想以想見的了。</p>
<p>世上做母親的，祇要在飛機塲上看見他們那種威風凜凜的雄姿，或則看見在天空中的訓練情形，就是不聞他們在驚心動魄的戰塲上去打仗。也會感動心胸的了。從襁褓中扶養成人的兒子，一變而為雄糾紛，氣昻昻的好男兒，做母親的也會驚異，敬長。竟然惶惑起來，是不是我的兒子。有一句所謂「神兵」的話，他們眞正是「神的子」。</p>
<h3>地上訓練純熟後始向天空</h3>
<p>小燕子飛到天空，先前總得經過長期訓練。少年飛行兵在趁練習機向天空作處女飛行之前，也同樣的經過一番艱苦的地上訓練。照樣登在所做地上駕駛為練機的飛機模型內，實習種種技巧。這個地上駕駛機，述結在所做航跡器的紀錄器上，少年們的駕駛情形，都表示在教官桌上的航踴器的針上。</p>
<p>一些也不疏忽。這個地上駕駛訓訓練如果不能十分於會，就不能飛翔於天空。假使稍不留神，或欠熟練，那未空中飛行就會發生破綻。祗要技術高明，再也沒有像飛機一樣安全的東西了。每天飛翔的飛機，正不知有多少架，而出事犧牲的，差不多十沒有。　　決不是危險的東西。這就是熊谷飛行學校敎官所講的話。</p>
<h3>復命聲中充滿美的緊張生的躍動</h3>
<p>人稱少年飛行兵是這一世的神兵。少年的純潔，淸新的魂胆，比地上任同一切事物來得美，來得貴。可以充分發揮這個魂的，就是少年飛行兵的姿態吧！</p>
<p>紀律，秩序，勇氣等等一切美的勇壯精神，可以充分表示出來的，就練習飛行完畢後向敎官復命時侯的態度。四五個少年都並立在距離教官數步的所在。舉手行禮之後，他們就復命。那種爽快的動作，宏亮的聲音，各人的性格，體格，容貌不同。誠懇的神情，忠貫的報告，在這裹沒有處偽、空虛的世界。</p>
<p>在復命聲中的一刹那，允滿着美妙的緊張情緒和生命的躍動。</p>
<p>國民論壇</p>
<h3>造就技術人才</h3>
<p>— 秦牧</p>
<p>目前中國普邇惑到技術人才的缺乏，這事有關新中國建設前途甚大。</p>

<h3>What Happens After the Cotton Cloth is Purchased?</h3>
<p>The government's purchase of cotton cloth and supplementary registration this time stipulates that there will be absolutely no extension of the deadline. At the same time, holders of cotton cloth have all completed the procedures within the time limit without waiting and seeing. The government's resolute attitude and the public's spirit of cooperation with the government are both worthy of praise. Now, although the deadline for applications and registration has only passed for a little over ten days, the people have long been hoping for the implementation of cotton cloth distribution methods like a great drought hoping for rain clouds. First, from the perspective of consumers, the autumn wind has risen, and everyone is precisely at the time of adding winter clothing, but the materials for adding winter clothing cannot be purchased anywhere in the city. Especially for families with weddings and funerals and pregnant women, the need is even more urgent. Second, from the perspective of small cloth shops, all cloth shops have stopped operating before the application deadline. To this day, more than half a month has passed, with no income and expenses remaining the same. This situation is naturally very difficult to maintain. Third, from the perspective of factories, production may have to stop due to the lack of raw materials. However, after production stops, all expenses still cannot be saved, and the difficult situation is the same as that of retail stores. We understand very well that the work of sorting out applications and registrations is extraordinarily heavy, and we also know that creating a new distribution method must go through many thorough considerations. However, on the other hand, we cannot help but hope that the authorities will also consider the widespread difficulties in society and strive to correct the common problem of slow handling of affairs by general agencies in the past. The sooner it is announced, the sooner the widespread difficulties will be relieved. We also hope that before the announcement, all procedures can be prepared completely, so that the announcement is one thing, and the implementation is another. The situation when the rice and grain joint venture took over the distribution of household rice was a very bad precedent. We hope that this time we will not repeat the same mistake.</p>
<p>Before the cotton cloth distribution method is announced, we summarize the opinions of all parties and offer several principles:</p>
<p>Thrift and frugality are the natural principles of wartime, and the people have already understood this. Moreover, the purchasing power of the general public in wartime is also implicitly equivalent to a natural restriction. However, the minimum needs are absolutely unavoidable. To make the distribution method thorough, the distribution quantity must first be reasonable. Otherwise, on the one hand, to meet the needs of life, and on the other hand, to supply this need, the black market still cannot be eliminated. Taking the rice distribution situation as an example, the implementation of the method of rationing grain according to the number of people is not intended to eliminate the black market? However, the existence of black market rice has now become an open secret. Who among the millions of citizens in Shanghai (including all levels of civil servants in various agencies) is not a customer of black market rice? Hundreds and hundreds of rice vendors on the road are constantly coming and going, and food agencies can certainly see them. The reason is that the amount of rations is too far from the actual amount needed. From the perspective of human relations, we have to adopt a laissez-faire approach, but the meaning of distributing food has been fundamentally lost, and the government's prestige cannot be unaffected. Clothing and food are equally important to people's lives. Since there has been a bad phenomenon in food distribution before, it should be taken as a warning when formulating cotton cloth distribution methods. Therefore, the quantity of cotton cloth distributed is even more worthy of careful consideration.</p>
<p>The purpose of the government's purchase of cotton cloth is to curb hoarding, stabilize prices, and stabilize democracy. In this case, the distribution price of cotton cloth should not be too far from the purchase price. Most importantly, the government should not contain any financial effects in handling this matter. In other words, it should not be done for profit.</p>
<p>The use of cotton cloth, whether it belongs to manufacturing and processing or consumption, the number of levels through which it passes in the distribution process should be as few as possible. The more levels, the more complicated the procedures, the longer the time, and the greater the cost. Finally, the recipient of the distribution will inevitably suffer from both time and economic losses. The distribution procedure in our ideal is as follows:</p>
<p>Commercial Control Commission——Federation——Various Trade Associations　Manufacturers and Processors　Retailers——Consumers</p>
<p>The above hypothetical procedure still inevitably accommodates the current organizational system of the Commercial Control Commission. If the federation level can be omitted, the handling of affairs can be more agile. In the distribution system, wholesalers are superfluous and profit-seeking, and there is no need for their existence. Therefore, we advocate resolutely canceling it, which is quite worthy of research when formulating distribution methods in order to reduce the burden on consumers.</p>
<p>The government's purchase of cotton cloth this time, the payment method is half gold and half deposit slips, but both must be paid in batches after a considerable period of time. If it is stipulated that goods will be delivered in cash after the implementation of the distribution method, then merchants will inevitably have to raise another sum of funds, and the difficulties that can be imagined are that loans are not easy to obtain and interest rates are too high. The former is just a problem for the merchants themselves, and the latter will inevitably increase the burden on consumers. We suggest that the government can instruct merchants to also provide a corresponding guarantee to distribute cotton cloth on a "goods first, payment later" basis. In this way, the interest item can be reduced in the stipulated profit of merchants, which will greatly benefit the people.</p>
<p>The distribution of cotton cloth for consumption must be handled in the same way as household rice, and the rationing coupon system must be adopted to prevent retailers from manipulating it.</p>
<p>The opinions we want to offer regarding the cotton cloth distribution method are as above. In addition, there are still a few opinions on the procurement aspect:</p>
<p>The payment of a portion of the purchase price in gold has already been seen in the government's explicit order, and it is naturally unlikely to change. However, in wartime, gold and silver are generally owned by the state. The authorities in the former "concessions" would also prohibit bidding and sales of gold, and they are still seeking public decontrol. Now that the government has stipulated that gold should be the price for the purchase of cotton cloth, in fact, it has already recognized that people can freely hold, carry, buy, and sell. However, the people have not yet fully understood this point, and it is appropriate to issue another order to clearly declare it.</p>
<p>After cotton cloth is purchased by the government, it becomes the property of the state. Special attention should be paid to storage. The nature of cotton cloth is that once it is exposed to moisture and evaporates, it will become corrupt, and even completely useless. At this time of difficult wartime production and material resources, all materials must be especially cherished and cared for, not to mention that cotton cloth is a daily necessity for people's livelihood. In the past, various agencies did not pay much attention to storing public goods, and major losses often occurred. In view of the various situations in the past, we specifically propose this, hoping that the authorities will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>The total value of the cotton cloth purchased this time, even calculated at the purchase price, is more than 600,000 million national currency. In addition to paying special attention to storage, supervision should not be ignored. In order to show faith to the people, the government should organize an inspection committee, hire fair people from all walks of life, serve as inspectors, conduct inspections on a regular basis, and report publicly.</p>
<p>The problem of people's food in Shanghai is becoming increasingly serious. This year, there has been a bumper harvest of rice in various parts of Central China, and in theory, this phenomenon should not exist. The key to the problem should be that farmers value physical objects and are unwilling to sell as much surplus grain as possible. We should guide the situation and export a large amount of cotton cloth in exchange for rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains to solve the people's food problem in the cities.</p>

<h3>Japan's Fourth Aviation Memorial Day - Aircraft Dedication and Naming Ceremony Held - Unprecedented Enthusiastic Celebrations Across Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - The 20th is Japan's Fourth Aviation Memorial Day, and enthusiastic celebrations were held throughout the country.

<h3>Japanese Residents in China Obey Chinese Tax Laws - Implementation Begins on October 1</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) - China and Japan concluded a treaty on the taxation of Japanese subjects in China on July 31 of last year. This is the first step in abolishing extraterritoriality. Based on the supplementary agreement of the treaty, the National Government notified Ambassador Tani on the 10th of this month that Japanese citizens should obey the laws of the Republic of China and the applicable methods. After careful consultation between the Chinese and Japanese authorities, the results have been published in the official gazettes of the two governments on September 20. Japanese subjects in China must obey Chinese tax laws from October 1. The smooth implementation of this important measure can fully demonstrate the firm determination of China and Japan to cooperate in building a new order in East Asia. The taxes listed in this first notification, in addition to income tax, include salt tax, consolidated tax, liquor tax, stamp tax, mining tax, temporary special tax on silkworms, passage tax, commodity tax, etc., all central taxes and part of local taxes.</p>
<p>Statement Issued by the Japanese Embassy</p>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government previously notified the Japanese Embassy that Japanese residents in China should obey the scope of taxation laws and the applicable forms of the Republic of China. The Japanese Embassy authorities issued a statement on this at 3:00 p.m. on the 20th, the main points of which are as follows: China and Japan concluded a treaty on the taxation of Japanese subjects in the Republic of China on July 31 of this year, and stated that Japanese subjects must obey all Chinese taxation laws from August 1. According to the provisions of Article 1 of the supplementary agreement, regarding the scope and applicable forms of Chinese taxation laws that Japanese residents in China should obey, the Chinese side should first notify the Japanese side step by step, and the Japanese side will formally pay taxes based on the tax items listed in the notification in accordance with the provisions of the treaty. This has already been seen in the statement issued by the embassy authorities on July 31. Since the beginning of this treaty, in order to ensure its smooth implementation, the Chinese side has carefully studied the scope of laws and applicable forms that should be notified to the Japanese side. After the review was completed, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government notified the Japanese Embassy in China on September 10. In the very short period of time after the conclusion of this treaty, it will be put into concrete implementation, which is truly a cause for celebration for China and Japan's cooperation in completing the Greater East Asia War. The purpose and content of this treaty can be clearly understood from the explanations given by the embassy authorities in the past regarding this treaty. The tax laws notified by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government this time include most of the central taxes, five types of local taxes in North China, Central China, and South China, and most of the local taxes in Mengjiang. The implementation of these tax laws will be fully implemented from October 1, except for the business tax, which still has a certain period of hesitation. The Chinese side is actively studying the draft laws that should be notified for the remaining local taxes, and will continue to issue second and third notifications after they are completed. Regarding local taxes without such formal notification, it is hoped that Japanese residents will continue to pay them in accordance with the spirit of Sino-Japanese cooperation. In addition, the exemption of taxes for soldiers, military personnel, and military supplies, as well as the reduction and exemption of taxes for items necessary for the Greater East Asia War in over-key industries and important materials exported to Japan, will still be handled as before.</p>

<h3>Javanese Residents Excited - Willing to Form a Volunteer Corps - Defend the Homeland and Build Greater East Asia</h3>
<p>Jakarta, 20th (Central News Agency) - The enthusiasm of the indigenous people of Indonesia to defend their homeland has now reached its climax. In recent days, various places have expressed their willingness to form volunteer corps. Jun Ruan Xin Die, a metalworker who lives in Sangzhou, and more than 60 members of the youth group who are diligent in serving on the 16th, have submitted volunteer letters to the authorities one after another, expressing their willingness to organize a defense volunteer corps. Following this, 161 people including Diejiara Guan and workers Gahrnan Nong Bataribo from Lijiecun in the state also submitted volunteer letters to the Sangshilong state chief, hoping to join the defense volunteer corps when it is formed. At the same time, Raja Mirav, chairman of the Pakor Women's Association, also said: At this critical moment, we women must not take a bystander attitude.

<p>Surabaya, 20th (Central News Agency) - Since the Japanese army occupied this place, the Japanese military government has protected and cultivated Islam in this place based on the basic principle of respecting religion. On the 1st of this month, influential leaders of the two major Islamic organizations in Java were also elected as nominal members of the Central Senate in the name of religious groups. Since then, Indonesian Muslims have become more and more excited, and their enthusiasm for building Greater East Asia and defending their homeland has also increased. Therefore, on the 13th of this month, 50 million Muslims jointly submitted a letter to the military government, suggesting that an Islamic defense team be formed immediately.</p>
<p>Talk by Elder Hashim of the Islamic Association</p>
<p>Hashim, an elder of the Javanese Islamic Church, once said on this matter: This time, Japan has rescued Indonesian people from the oppression of the Dutch tyranny, and now they have been liberated and given various relief. After the Japanese army pacified Java, they immediately adhered to the basic principle of respecting religion and did their best to protect us Muslims. This time, they also appointed my son and many other Islamic leaders as nominal members of the Central Senate, which is truly beyond the expectations of Muslims. We can only be grateful for this. Javanese Muslims can now lead a happy religious life thanks to the power of Japan, but this can only be ensured if Japan wins this war. From the perspective of religious doctrine, engaging in holy war can lead to transcendence even in death. Japan is now fighting with all its national strength to provide us with liberation. This is to protect us Javanese Muslims, so for us, Japan's war is a holy war. Therefore, we Muslims have reached the time to take up arms to seek Japan's victory. Therefore, the righteousness of forming a fellow Muslim defense team presented on the 13th is our declared determination. Therefore, all the students of the school have made the determination to defend Java themselves in order to seek Japan's victory. For this reason, I am also willing to dedicate my old bones to this holy war. In addition, this person is now 71 years old, has made pilgrimages to Mecca several times, has been running an Islamic school for 36 years, has 80,000 disciples, and is now an elder of Islam and is highly respected by all.</p>

From September 8th to 17th, the German Air Force sank three Allied cruisers, two destroyers, one minelayer, fifteen landing craft, and nine transport ships totaling 58,000 tons. They also severely damaged two cruisers, three destroyers, one landing craft, one large tanker, and seven other ships totaling 35,000 tons, which are presumed to have sunk. Heavy fighting continued on the Salerno front on the 18th. German forces have linked up with troops arriving from the south, shortening the front line according to plan.</p>
<h3>Badoglio Joins the Allies</h3>

<p>Inside Story of Secret US-Italian Negotiations</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 20th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: The "Evening Review" has just published a report from its military correspondent stationed at the US military headquarters. The report contains highly noteworthy information regarding secret US-Italian armistice negotiations. It is claimed that prior to the US landing at Salerno, representatives, General Taylor and Colonel Gardner, were sent to Rome to personally discuss the details of the armistice with Badoglio. When Badoglio received the US representatives, he declared with tears in his eyes, "I swear on my honor and my fifty years of military service that I am truly loyal to the aims of the Allied nations." The report continues that the US representatives first traveled by British torpedo boat from Palermo, and then, far from the shore, transferred to an Italian torpedo boat and arrived at a location called "Gede," where they were escorted by an Italian general by car to Rome to discuss the terms of the armistice. After the negotiations, they returned to the US military headquarters by Italian plane.</p>

<h3>Current Status of Industry in Vietnam</h3>
<p>Vietnam's self-sufficiency system is being actively promoted in various economic sectors. Vietnam is inherently rich in agricultural and forestry resources, and its biggest problem at present is how to rapidly achieve industrialization. Although this problem has various difficulties in reality, it can be gradually resolved and implemented with technical materials and capital assistance from Japan. Therefore, Vietnam has high expectations for Japan. The current state of industry in Vietnam is as follows:</p>
<p>Rice Milling Industry</p>
<p>The rice milling industry, centered on Ti An, already shows a considerable daily output. The problem of increasing and repairing rice milling machinery can be completely resolved soon with Japanese cooperation.</p>
<p>Substitute Fuel Industry</p>
<p>The alcohol industry for substitute petroleum is currently engaged in large-scale manufacturing. Other manufacturing industries, such as machine oil and lubricating oil, also use castor oil, peanut oil, and fish oil as raw materials for manufacturing.</p>
<p>Chemical Industry</p>
<p>Before the war, the chemical industry in Vietnam was almost non-existent. Due to the impact of the war, it is now engaged in small-scale operations. However, because raw materials must rely on imports, it has not yet escaped the experimental stage. Products include carbonized coal, black gunpowder, caustic soda, hydrochloric acid, glycerin, and stearic acid. Among them, black gunpowder is made from artillery mountain materials, so it is quite important.</p>
<p>Building Materials Manufacturing Industry</p>
<p>Cement is the only important component of the building material manufacturing industry in Vietnam. For example, the Vietnam Cement Company can produce several tons per day, which is quite large in scale. Recently, due to significant technological progress, its production performance is considered excellent. As for the production of bricks, it has also increased due to a sharp increase in demand. However, the realization of a mechanized manufacturing industry is currently the most urgent task.</p>
<p>Textile Industry</p>
<p>The recent particularly noticeable trend is the utilization of locally produced silk, cotton, and other textile fibers. It has progressed from the stage of active research to the stage of complete experimentation. A certain textile factory near a certain location has been completely modernized. If raw materials can be secured, it can be estimated as the most active position in various industries.</p>
<p>Paper Manufacturing Industry</p>
<p>The Indochina Paper Company is the only paper manufacturer in Vietnam. However, its production volume can only meet one-tenth of the demand so far. Recognizing this, the authorities have encouraged the home paper manufacturing industry. Local newspapers are generally supplied by home paper manufacturers. Now, a decision has been made to import from Japan and start direct paper making. Therefore, Vietnam's paper use problem can be resolved soon.</p>
<p>Leather Industry</p>
<p>Vietnam has abundant leather raw materials. However, due to the lack of tannins, it is difficult to manufacture leather products. Recently, in view of the importance of tannins, active production increases have been implemented. Therefore, it is expected that obstacles to leather making can be removed soon.</p>
<p>Rubber Industry</p>
<p>Although Vietnam has rubber resources with an annual output of several tons or more, the product industry is simple, limited to water pillows, tricycle tires, etc. As for automobile tires, they have never been able to be manufactured. Furthermore, because the import of this type of item has decreased sharply, the current focus of the rubber industry in Vietnam has been placed on the active research of automobile tires and other rubber products. In addition, tricycles are currently an important means of transportation in Vietnam, so active production increases are also necessary.</p>
<h3>German Weapons on the Eastern Front Display Astonishing Effect, Achieving Complete Victory in Defensive Battles</h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: South and north of the Smolensk road to Moscow, German weapons once again achieved a complete defensive victory in Saturday's battles. Soviet forces, with fresh reserves, joined the battle along a broad front. Under the cover of powerful air forces, these reserves repeatedly attacked German positions, resulting in fierce battles with temporary advances and retreats. However, the German front line remained as solid as before. German automatic weapons displayed astonishing effectiveness, and the Soviet army suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>Like a Blast Furnace</p>
<p>The situation near the areas between the two supply roads is similar. The intensity of the fighting continued unabated. The enemy's large-scale offensives were continuously supplied with reinforcements from areas such as Yalnya, Dorogobush, and Yartzevo. The entire war zone resembled a magician's blast furnace. Although the enemy launched large-scale offensives, the German lines remained firm and unmoved. The enemy's tank losses are inestimable. Southwest of Roslavl, the Soviet army increased its troop strength by several infantry divisions and powerful tank forces. The enemy broke through deep gaps in the German positions.</p>
<p>Shortening the Front Line</p>
<p>As a result, the German forces in the area had to shorten their front line. However, the German movements were orderly, and they fought and retreated while continuously engaging the enemy. Near dusk, a powerful German air force broke the striking power of the Soviet forces occupying the stronghold, providing considerable relief to the German forces on the ground, while the Soviet forces suffered heavy losses. Although the Soviet forces broke through the German front line, they were immediately cut off by German and Hungarian infantry, neutralizing the effect of the enemy's fierce attack.</p>
<p>Repelling the Offensive</p>
<p>Apart from the Leningrad area, the situation on the northern part of the Eastern Front on Saturday remained calm, with only activity on the Ilmen front. Soviet forces, with the strength of several infantry regiments and several tank detachments, repeatedly attacked from the east wall of the German encirclement of Leningrad. The enemy's objective was to seize the German positions in the Sniavino Highlands. The German forces repelled the Soviet offensive in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>Continuing to Retreat Westward</p>
<p>Between the Donets and Dnieper rivers, German forces continued to retreat westward under the protection of a powerful rearguard. On Saturday, Soviet forces again attempted to pursue the retreating German forces to their designated positions. At that time, the German forces launched a sudden counterattack, and the Soviet forces were caught off guard, suffering heavy losses, and in some places, the Soviet forces had to retreat. The Soviet army paid a heavy price for misjudging the German retreat.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting in the South</p>
<p>Fierce hand-to-hand combat broke out in Pavlograd. Soviet forces made several local breakthroughs, but the German forces cut off the enemy's communications to counter the effect of the breakthroughs. The position of the main German front line remained unmoved. West of Kalif, the Soviet offensive was scattered. The German rearguard inflicted considerable losses on the enemy. Northwest of Kakov, the German air force assisted the German forces on the ground very successfully. The Soviet forces, with powerful tanks and infantry units, attempted to cut off German rear communications. A fierce battle occurred in the Ubal area. The Soviet army had no success and lost many tanks. The weather situation in the Kupen bridgehead area has improved. The Soviet army repeatedly attacked the Kupen River with a large number of tanks, but ultimately failed.</p>
<h3>Welles to be Appointed U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union; Steinhardt Has Returned Home</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to Moscow sources, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, has left Moscow and returned to Washington to confer with President Roosevelt. Details of the meeting have not been released by the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. At the same time, German News Agency, citing Washington sources, reported: Welles, who recently resigned from his position as Under Secretary of State, will replace Steinhardt as the new U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Soviet Envoy to Sweden Promoted</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Soviet envoy to Sweden, Madame Kollontai, recently confirmed to a Reuters representative that she has been promoted to the rank of ambassador. She stated that this promotion is merely a recognition by the Soviet government of her merits and an honor bestowed upon her. Although Madame Kollontai has been promoted to ambassador, the legation will remain the same and will not be upgraded to an embassy.</p>
<h3>Residents of Hungarian Capital Ordered to Evacuate</h3>
<p>Bern, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to Vichy Radio, the Hungarian government has ordered the evacuation of a portion of the residents of the capital.</p>
<h3>German Commander Appeals to Italian Farm and Industrial Workers</h3>
<p>Milan, 19th (Central News Agency) – The German commander-in-chief of central Italy, Field Marshal Kesselring, tonight appealed to Italian industrial and farm workers, requesting them to go to Germany as free workers to assist in the joint German-Italian war effort. The appeal was broadcast to the entire occupied area of Italy.</p>
<h3>Serbian Prime Minister Meets with Hitler to Discuss New Situation in Southeastern Europe</h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – According to an official announcement, Führer Hitler received Serbian Prime Minister Nedić at his headquarters yesterday. Prior to this meeting, the Serbian leader also had a long discussion with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to discuss Serbian policy.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – After German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop had a lengthy meeting with Serbian Prime Minister Nedić at the Führer's headquarters, the Prime Minister also met with Führer Hitler. This meeting is of great significance as it relates to Germany's new policies in the Balkans. Italy's strong territorial claims on Corfu in the Balkans and southern France have been an obstacle to Germany's construction of a new European order. Now that the Italian royal family, which is demanding territory, has effectively been replaced, the German government is implementing a new policy toward the Balkan countries, emulating Japan's policy of building a new order in East Asia. A diplomatic correspondent for the German News Agency recently reported on the Serbian Prime Minister's visit to the Führer's headquarters, stating that the Serbian Prime Minister's visit is particularly noteworthy. The attitude of the Italian royal family is not only hindering the resolution of outstanding issues in southwestern Europe, but also hindering relations between those countries and Germany. Although the status of Serbia since the collapse of Yugoslavia has not yet been resolved, the German government is satisfied with the cooperative attitude of the Serbian Prime Minister, and the smooth resolution of the issue is not in doubt. Given the situation where Britain and the United States are making great concessions to the Soviet Union in southern and southwestern Europe, the Balkan countries have no choice but to cooperate with Germany. Key figures in southwestern Europe should recognize this point.</p>
<h3>Mussolini Remains in Germany; Commander of Militia Expresses Loyalty to Leader</h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Führer's headquarters announced on the 19th that Marshal Mussolini, after being rescued, went to the Führer's headquarters in Germany to meet with Hitler, which has lasted for several days.</p>
<p>Rome, 20th (Central News Agency) – Rome Radio reported last night that Lieutenant General Ricci, commander of the Fascist legions, sent a telegram to Mussolini after taking office, guaranteeing loyalty and obedience.</p>
<h3>Analysis of German War Power (2)</h3>
<p>— Tadataka Ikezaki</p>
<p>Germany is Inferior to the Soviet Union in Food Supply</p>
<p>Regarding the food problem, the Soviet Union's self-sufficiency cannot be considered superior to that of Germany either. I dare say that the current Soviet offensive is because the Soviet Union's food problem cannot ignore the recovery of Ukraine. Even a cold and calculating man like Stalin, although he knows that he is trapped in Germany's attrition tactics, cannot help but expend large amounts of weapons and manpower in the face of their defensive tactics of inducement.</p>
<p>Before the war, Germany's food self-sufficiency rate was generally above 80%. If we add food exporting countries such as Romania and Bulgaria, as well as Ukraine, the granary of Europe, then Germany's position in terms of food self-sufficiency is far superior to what ordinary people think. Moreover, three million prisoners of war have been assigned to rural areas to be used in wasteland reclamation to produce food. Therefore, from today's perspective, Germany, which has gained valuable experience in the previous war, is unlikely to repeat its mistakes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Soviet Union's food self-sufficiency was excellent at 100% before the war, but that was in the era of securing Ukraine, the granary of Europe. Since its loss, it has been in dire straits. According to Rosenberg, the governor of the eastern occupied territories, the area sown in Ukraine has been expanded beyond that under Soviet rule. It is said that Ukraine has had a particularly good harvest this year, which is making the difference between Germany and the Soviet Union in the food problem increasingly large.</p>
<p>Enduring Hardship and Working Hard</p>
<p>Fourth, when it comes to the national spiritual strength to endure the sacrifices and horrors of war, the Soviet Union will ultimately not be an enemy of Germany either. The histories of both countries give a clear answer to this point. Let us look back at the Germans during the Thirty Years' War and the Seven Years' War. In these two wars, although the Germans were in dire suffering, they proved that they have unparalleled endurance in the world, and told us that they often use their unparalleled endurance to open up their own fate.</p>
<p>In particular, the Germans know more clearly than anyone else the fate that Germany will face if it suffers defeat in this war. A recent Berlin dispatch from Yomiuri Hochi described the current state of mind of the German people, saying that the entire country is filled with a spirit of enduring hardship and working hard.</p>
<p>So how is the Soviet Union in this regard? The history of the Slavic people tells us that in the Crimean War, the fall of Sevastopol immediately thwarted Russia's will to fight. In the Russo-Japanese War, the Battle of Mukden and the Battle of Tsushima caused Russia at the time to have the idea that continuing the war was futile. Russia's strength in the Napoleonic Wars can be seen as an exception in the Slavic nation.</p>
<p>I do not regard the Slavic people under Stalin's rule as the same as before, but we often feel that the eternal qualities that are latent in the nationality cannot be changed overnight.</p>
<p>Comprehensive War Power of Britain and the United States</p>
<p>For the reasons mentioned above, if we simply regard the European war as a German-Soviet war, Germany has a 70% chance of winning, and the Soviet Union's position is by no means optimistic. Therefore, the most important point in predicting the future of the European war is the extent to which the comprehensive war power of Britain and the United States can supplement the fragility of the Soviet Union. If the comprehensive war power of Britain and the United States supplements the fragility of the Soviet Union and there is still room to spare, then the development of the European war will naturally be unfavorable to Germany.</p>
<p>The comprehensive war power of Britain and the United States is not enough to directly threaten Germany's strategic position, because it exists outside the European fortress. No matter how vast it is, it does not have the qualifications to make up for the Soviet Union's fragility. Stalin, who is familiar with the intricacies of this, has not absolutely demanded a second front from Britain and the United States since the spring of 1942, which is only natural.</p>
<p>In this sense, Montgomery's landing in Calabria has great significance. How the future war will develop is unpredictable, but assuming that the Axis forces fail to defend and the entire territory of Italy completely falls into the hands of the Allied forces, how will Germany cope in this worst-case scenario?</p>
<p>Some British and American commentators say that controlling the entire territory of Italy will certainly not kill Germany, but Germany will save troops and materials as a result, and will incorporate a powerful part of the army as its own, and will still be able to utilize a large number of laborers, so there is no reason for pessimism about Germany's position at this time.</p>
<p>This argument can of course be regarded as a propaganda tactic on the part of Britain and the United States and should not be easily trusted. But even if this is a propaganda tactic, there is some truth behind this argument, and it would not be wise to simply dismiss it as a propaganda tactic. Because according to current warfare theory and facts, even after losing the entire territory of Italy, Germany's strategic position is still quite solid.</p>
<p>From a strategic point of view, "Rather than regarding Italy as part of the European fortress, it is better to regard it as one of the prominent positions." In defending the European fortress, there is always the possibility of being cut off. Between the two, there is the natural barrier of the Alps. Due to past history, it has not only proved to be an impenetrable barrier, but the mountain warfare theorist Franz Freiherr von Kux has also explained it in detail.</p>
<p>Allied Forces Difficult to Break Through Natural Barrier</p>
<p>If the elite German forces occupy the strategic points of this mountainous area and block the Allied advance, they will be able to achieve their objective with a ratio of one to six or one to seven. If the Allied forces dare to break through this natural barrier, there is the possibility of repeating the tragedy of Aragon anywhere. The Soviet Union's placement of the Allied landing in Calabria as the primary objective, and not considering it as the formation of the so-called second front, is not without reason.</p>
<p>The German High Command may have already anticipated this and is slowly controlling the enemy's offensive by occupying the strategic points of the Alps in the event of an emergency. Therefore, Britain and the United States believe that if they want to realistically deliver a blow to Germany and inflict a fatal blow, they cannot be satisfied with capturing the Italian peninsula, but must go on to directly attack the European fortress. There is no other way than to carry out a large-scale landing operation on this.</p>
<p>Many Difficulties in European Landing</p>
<p>However, the Allied landing operation in Europe encountered an unsolvable problem in terms of transportation. Since the beginning of the war, Britain and the United States have already lost more than 30 million tons of ships. If we consider that they must prepare for the war in East Asia on one hand and constantly replenish the landing forces in Italy on the other, how will they raise the large number of troops needed for the European landing operation and the cargo space for transporting all the war materials?</p>
<p>Recalling the previous war, the United States needed about 17.5 tons of cargo space for each soldier sent to Europe. Considering the current situation, which is far more mechanized than it was then, assuming that one million soldiers are dispatched from the United States to Europe, at least 20 million tons of cargo space would be required. The content of the Quebec meeting between Britain and the United States was revealed by the Soviet newspaper, saying: Choose a place to land where there are no German troops. Therefore, their purpose is in a place that everyone is not paying attention to for a while, otherwise they are afraid they would never take this risk.</p>
<p>German Forces on Eastern Front Far-Sighted</p>
<p>The operations of the German forces on the Eastern Front have at least two objectives. On one hand, using a retreat strategy to lure the Soviet army to attack, abandoning inches of land in exchange for large sacrifices, while gradually shortening the front line in retreat, planning to conserve as much troop strength as possible to deal with the second front of Britain and the United States. It is said that the modification of the Orel salient alone has enabled the German forces to save the strength of twenty divisions. I cannot help but admire the far-sightedness of the German forces.</p>
<p>Therefore, the one playing the role of the 1918 Ludendorff offensive is clearly not the current German army, but the Soviet army. In Orel alone, the German army's battle results amounted to 5,514 tanks, 854 artillery pieces, and 2,119 aircraft. The result of this unexpected consumption may at any time induce the Soviet Union's demise. Before the opening of the second front of Britain and the United States, Soviet newspapers exclaimed that the Soviet Union was immediately on the verge of crisis. The situation mentioned above can be fully discerned from this argument.</p>
<p>The position of Britain and the United States after the Soviet Union withdraws no longer needs to be said. They deeply feel how important the Soviet Union is for their victory. The Thames calculation case said that in the plan for a frozen world, the cooperation of the Soviet Union is necessary no matter what, most euphemistically expressing this feeling. The recent statement by Hopkins has told us even more directly. From this point of view, last year's Stalin offensive was not the Sedan of the German army. Similarly, Hitler's belief in victory has not yet reached the point where it can be dismissed as superstition. What significance does this have for Britain and the United States now?

<h3>Rice and Grain Unified Committee Establishes Procurement Guild, Sends Letters to Chambers of Commerce in Three Provinces and Cities, Requesting Representatives to Participate and Investigate Local Production Conditions and Rice Quality</h3>
<p>According to inquiries from a Shanghai News Agency reporter yesterday from relevant sources, the Rice Unified Committee is paying close attention to rice procurement and transportation. It plans to send letters to chambers of commerce in rice-producing counties and cities in three provinces, designating local rice industry leaders to participate in the planned "Rice and Grain Procurement Trade Association." However, each location should not send more than ten people. At the same time, the committee hopes to conduct a thorough investigation into local rice production conditions and types of rice, and attach a form to the letter, requesting immediate reporting to the Rice Unified Committee for verification. The Rice and Grain Unified Committee was originally scheduled to be established on the 20th, but due to incomplete procedures, the establishment was postponed. The committee is expected to be established soon. The organization will be headed by a chairman. It has now been decided to add a vice-chairman, who will be selected from experienced members of the rice industry. As for the purpose of establishing the "Rice and Grain Procurement Trade Association," it is to connect procurement merchants in various rice-producing areas to unify procurement work. Once the nominated participants from various regions are determined, it can be formally established.</p>
<p>Personnel Selection for Various Positions in the Grain Unified Committee</p>
<p>The Rice and Grain Unified Committee is actively preparing, and most matters are nearing completion. It is expected to be formally established within days. Apart from the position of Secretary-General, which has not yet been decided, the heads of various departments have been determined. They include: Deputy Secretary-General [name omitted], Chief of General Affairs [name omitted] (concurrently), Chief of Procurement [name omitted], Chief of Storage and Distribution Chen Zi [name omitted], Chief of Finance [name omitted]. Other staff will be assigned separately to begin work. The office will be located on the first floor of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the office of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will be relocated.</p>
<p>The Future of the Committee Attracts Attention from All Quarters</p>
<p>The Rice and Grain Unified Committee, responsible for handling rice procurement, allocation, and other unified management matters under the Rice and Grain Procurement and Sales General Management Office of the Ministry of Food, has been actively preparing since being appointed by administrative order. It is expected to be formally established in Shanghai soon. The future development of the committee is attracting attention, and all parties have high expectations. Whether the rice and grain unification policy is successfully implemented directly affects the national economy and the people's livelihood. Overall, the committee's structure has the following characteristics: The members of the committee are all leading figures in the business community, which should highly leverage the self-governance capabilities of merchants. The relationship between the committee and the General Chamber of Commerce is slightly different from that of other professional committees. Professional committees are internal organizations of the General Chamber of Commerce, while the council is an external organization of the General Chamber of Commerce, effectively an independent body. Each professional committee is composed of merchants from only one industry, while the committee is composed of leading figures in the business community. To ensure close connection and convenient coordination with the General Chamber of Commerce, the director of the Materials Department of the General Chamber of Commerce and representatives from the Central Trust of China branch have been invited to serve as committee members. No Japanese personnel participate in the selection of directors and supervisors of the General Chamber of Commerce, while there are six Japanese representatives participating in the committee, which shows the special importance that both China and Japan attach to grain administration.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Defense Authorities Issue Another Notice: Pay Attention to Light Control, Appropriate Measures Will Be Taken If Neglected Again</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: On the afternoon of the 10th of this month, the local Japanese authorities issued an air defense alert. That night, many residents still neglected light control. In view of this, the Air Defense Command of the Japanese Army and Navy issued Notice No. 19 yesterday, reminding people to pay attention again. In the future, if there are any violations or negligence, measures will be taken, such as suspending electricity or other appropriate actions. The content of the notice is as follows, hoping that all residents of Shanghai will strictly abide by it.</p>
<p>Notice</p>
<p>Regarding air defense alert light control, warnings have been issued repeatedly during past exercises. However, during this alert, many people still neglected it and were not vigilant, which is regrettable. This behavior is unacceptable in terms of air defense and public interest. Residents of Shanghai must strictly abide by the regulations, be vigilant, and neighbors should remind each other. Self-defense corps members should also actively remind nearby residents. Double efforts should be made to ensure that there are no errors in every house and room. (Attached) In the future, those with poor control will have their electricity supply suspended or other appropriate measures taken.</p>
<h3>Telegraph Business Extremely Busy; Price Increase for Telegraphs to Central China May Be Implemented Next Month</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Datong News Agency has learned that the China Central Electrical Communication Company's increase in telegraph fees for the Central China region has not yet been announced, but it is rumored that it may be implemented in mid-October. As for the company's business, it has been extremely busy recently. In terms of international radio stations, the number of telegraphs to Berlin, Bangkok, and Geneva has been increasing daily. Since accepting Japanese telegrams, Hong Kong's workload has also been quite heavy. About 2,000 telegrams are exchanged with Osaka every day, with fewer to Tokyo. Domestically, wired communication in Suzhou, Hangzhou, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, and other places is also extremely busy. Although Nanjing uses duplex automatic communication, telegrams often pile up, averaging around 2,000 per day, and cannot be completed until 3:00 AM. Guangzhou also has over 2,000 incoming and outgoing telegrams daily, and there have been increases in Tianjin, Hankou, Qingdao, Taipei, and other locations.</p>
<h3>Japanese-American Exchange Ship Left Shanghai for Hong Kong Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Municipal Government Bans Military and Police from Watching Plays Without Tickets</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Pingju (Peking Opera) Alumni Association previously operated theaters run by its members. Military and police often refused to purchase tickets to enter and watch plays, which not only affected revenue but also caused trouble. Therefore, it specially petitioned the municipal government to request a ban in order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. After receiving the petition, the municipal government, believing that the matters presented were factual, forwarded it to all military and police agencies, instructing them to strictly restrain themselves. From now on, military and police personnel should purchase tickets to enter and watch plays and not cause trouble, so as to reassure merchants and residents.</p>
<h3>Four Materials Control Committees</h3>
<p>Following the establishment of the Non-Ferrous Metals, Iron and Steel, Machinery, and Timber Control Committees, the Chemical Products, Rubber, Cement, and Paper Industries Control Committees are also being organized. A reporter from Datong News Agency has learned the progress of the establishment of these four control committees as follows:</p>
<p>Chemical Products</p>
<p>The Chemical Products sector is centered on Kanebo, Iwai &amp; Co., and Mitsui Bussan, establishing the China Central Chemical Products Control Committee. It is roughly divided into industrial chemicals, coatings, dyes, and pigments. The specific plan for all establishment procedures is nearing completion, and it is expected that the staffing will be determined at the inaugural meeting on the 25th.</p>
<p>Rubber Control</p>
<p>The China Central Rubber Control Committee must be established as soon as possible in accordance with various circumstances. In order to establish the sales agency, the inaugural meeting may be held around the end of this month.</p>
<p>Cement Sector</p>
<p>The China Central Cement (i.e., Cement) Control Committee is centered on Mitsui &amp; Co. In order to strengthen control, the Cement item will become an independent agency and will not belong to the Chemical Products sector. The date of the committee's establishment is yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Paper Industry Sector</p>
<p>As for the establishment of the China Central Paper Industry Control Committee, the plan is roughly completed. The committee is centered on the Central China Paper Manufacturing Association and is divided into four sectors, including paper manufacturers, importers, sellers, and paper businesses. The control regulations for each sector will be completed soon. The membership qualifications and internal appointments of officers can also be determined in the near future, and the committee can be established by the end of the month at the latest.</p>
<h3>Grants Entrusted by All Sectors Are Selected; Zhang's Assistance for Impoverished Students Will Be Sent Immediately</h3>
<p>The grants entrusted by all sectors for this year have been selected successively. The list of recipients of Old Knight's grant for meals and the grants from Mr. Tan Xingbo and Mr. Chen Bingyun of the Dahua Bank are listed below: Mr. Old Knight generously donated 20,000 yuan to our newspaper in the previous year, designating it to subsidize ten impoverished high school students with outstanding achievements in subjects such as physics and chemistry. Due to time constraints, it was moved to this year's management. Due to academic requirements, there are very few high school students specializing in physics and chemistry, making it impossible to select them. With the consent of the donor, it was moved to subsidize university students studying these subjects. A test was issued, and serious selection was made. The results have now been announced, and the distribution of subsidies has been decided as follows: Category A: Three university students: Yan Jiaying, Xu Shangde, [name omitted], each receiving a meal subsidy of 4,000 yuan. One high school student: Ding Meisun, receiving a meal subsidy of 3,000 yuan. Category B: Six students receiving the cost of books required for this semester, including Liu Ye, Zhang Dingcheng, Xiong Wenzhong, Luo Yichou, each receiving 700 yuan, Jiang Wenzhi and Chen Ji each receiving 500 yuan. Also, Category B: Six high school students, including Qian Qishen, Xie Guangcheng, Zheng You[character unclear], Wang Zhenyu, Lu [character unclear]jing, Shen Xin, each receiving 200 yuan for book expenses.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen and Mr. Tan</p>
<p>Mr. Tan Xingbo and Mr. Chen Bingyun, managers of Dahua Bank, spare no effort in supporting our newspaper's grant campaign. In the previous year, they sent a letter entrusting us to provide scholarships for ten outstanding impoverished high school students and four university students. The two will bear the tuition and miscellaneous fees of the students. If the academic performance of the recommended students is excellent, they will continue to provide assistance. Our newspaper will select and recommend outstanding students based on the results of the previous year's selection test. In addition to the two students who have graduated from university, one student who has dropped out due to illness, and one student who has been recommended separately, excellent students Jiang [name omitted] , Zhao Yanan, Zhang Zhaoqi, and [name omitted] Wen will be added. The remaining ten students will continue to be recommended for scholarships from the two gentlemen based on their excellent academic performance.</p>
<p>Zhang's Scholarship</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Yuwen, manager of the Great Southeast Tobacco Company, believes that scholarship work is of great significance. Recently, he entrusted our newspaper to select five outstanding impoverished students each from high school grades two and three, and university grades one or two, to be recommended for Mr. Zhang's scholarship for tuition and book expenses. Mr. Zhang is dedicated to helping students and benefiting the impoverished, which is commendable. Our newspaper will immediately handle the recommendation matters based on the results of this year's selection test. The final selection results will be announced later.</p>
<h3>Another Letter to the Business Community</h3>
<p>To the esteemed members of the business community: In view of the recent changes in Shanghai's industry and commerce, our newspaper intends to compile a "Shanghai Business Directory" for ease of reference. We have received data from various trade associations. We recently sent an open letter to the business community, requesting that you provide accurate survey data. We have received letters from various companies and factories, which we greatly appreciate. In order to further broaden the survey, we have created a form (see page 2 of this newspaper on September 20). We hope that the members of the business community will take the time to fill it out in detail according to the items and send it to us for detailed correction during compilation. Whether you are a member of a trade association or not, regardless of the size of your capital or the scope of your business, all Shanghai businesses are welcome.</p>
<p>Economic Review</p>
<h3>Prize Savings Week</h3>
<p>In order to encourage people's savings and channel general idle funds into banks, the Central Reserve Bank is holding a Prize Savings Week from the 15th to the 22nd of this month. It has mobilized 160 member banks of the city's banking association to participate fully in order to absorb term deposits, which is of profound significance.</p>
<p>There are many types of savings, but they generally fall into three categories: compulsory savings, free savings, and prize savings. Compulsory savings are clearly not easy to implement in China's current state. Free savings seem to have little success in China's current state. Only prize savings seem feasible. Therefore, the Second Plenary Session of the National Economic Council held in Beijing in the lower part of June this year approved the "Encourage People's Savings to Adapt to Wartime Economy" proposal. The Central Reserve Bank's supervision of all Shanghai banks to hold "Prize Savings Week" has reached the implementation stage of this case.</p>
<p>During wartime, people are restless, value goods over currency, and are indifferent to savings. This trend is not easy to change without pressure or rewards. Now that the government has compulsorily purchased yarn and cloth, it is using prize-bearing time deposits. With heavy rewards, popular customs can be changed. It is predicted that the increase in term deposits in banks and the contraction of idle funds on the market will become the natural result of the "Prize Savings Week".</p>
<h3>Shanghai Educational Association's List of Directors and Supervisors</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Educational Association was formally established on the 19th. In addition to electing Mayor Chen as the Honorary Chairman and Education Director Lin as the Honorary Director, the full list of directors and supervisors of the association is as follows: (Directors) Hu Dunfu, Zhou Huarren, Liu [name unclear]shan, Li Jinghan, Gao Tangxin, Zhuang Yaode, Yu Jiangdong, Cai Liling, Yu Jingwu, Zhu Shaozeng, Zhang Zhong[name unclear], [name unclear] Sixiao, Lu Zongxun, (Alternate Directors) Wang Shibing, [name unclear] Yizhi, Shen Chao, Zhao Zhuocheng, Chen Zenan. (Supervisors) Yuan Ludeng, Hou Yizhi, Shen Sizhi, Chen Keying, Xu Songshi, Shi Youfu, Hu Yunze, (Alternate Supervisors) Wang Xiuhe, Zhang Zheng.</p>
<p>Senior Police Officers to Receive Training</p>
<p>Central News Agency: In order to cultivate police officers and increase their academic skills, the First Police Bureau of Shanghai Special Municipality has selected senior police officers in batches to go to Beijing to receive training at the Central Police Academy. The first batch was officially announced by the Bureau Order the other day, including Yang Guangying, Wang Jiahua, Zhang Shusheng from the Special Police Division, and Gan Yougui and Mai Huasheng from the Economic Division. The five are scheduled to report to Beijing within days.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Residents Limited to Three Days to Receive Sugar</h3>
<p>The distribution of household sugar for August in the Fourth District (Shanghai Fourth) of this city only began yesterday (20th), and is limited to three days to complete the purchase, with no exceptions allowed after the deadline. According to the regulations of the Municipal Grain Bureau, this period's household sugar should have been distributed by last month. The household sugar in the Nanshi, City Center, and Zhabei districts was also distributed at the beginning of the month. Therefore, the delayed distribution and shortened purchase period of this period's household sugar in Shanghai Fourth District has caused inconvenience to the general residents of the Shanghai West district. This phenomenon occurred after the issuance of sugar certificates was handled by the neighborhood offices. It is hoped that the authorities can improve this.</p>

<h3>Donghua Football Team to Battle Su-Huai Again Today, 5 PM at Yiyuan</h3>
<p>The Su-Huai Expedition Football Team has completed its three-match schedule in Shanghai, but due to the postponement of their return date and their unwillingness to lose to Donghua in one match, they challenged Donghua the other day. After both sides agreed, it was decided that they would meet again at Yiyuan Stadium at 5 PM today. Su-Huai has achieved excellent results in Shanghai, winning three matches and maintaining friendly relations between provinces. If they can defeat Donghua today and avenge their loss, it would be a triumphant feat. Donghua has strengthened its team with the return of Sun Jinshun and Zhang Lin, but it is a pity that Wu Binghao is still recovering from a leg injury, which will affect their attacking power. The defense is quite solid. Su-Huai's Secretary, Geng Shufu, held his wedding yesterday afternoon at the International Hotel, filled with joy. General Xia will still play, proving his courage. Tickets for today's match are still 20 yuan and 10 yuan.</p>
<h3>International Tennis Tournament Schedule Determined</h3>
<p>The schedule for the China-Japan-Portugal-France International Tennis Tournament has been determined. It will be a knockout system with two singles and one doubles, best-of-three sets. It will begin this Saturday (25th) at 2:30 PM with Japan versus France. On Sunday, the 26th, China will play Portugal. On Saturday, next month (2nd), the final will be held at the original site of the McTyeire School. The representatives of the Chinese team will be selected tomorrow afternoon.</p>

<h3>Banking Industry and Firms Support Lending to Various Industries, Increasing Monthly Since the Implementation of the New Legal Tender</h3>
<p>In order to revive the market and support various industrial and commercial sectors, banking industries and firms have continued to provide loans to various industries in accordance with the lending restriction measures promulgated by the Ministry of Finance and the new lending methods adopted by the banking industry. The regulations stipulate that borrowers should not promote speculation and hoarding, and should adhere to the principle of normal business needs. In addition, they must be members of the relevant industry trade association and hold a license issued by the competent authorities. However, interest rates are subject to change depending on the market. According to statistics from the China Economic Research Institute, the total loans of 109 banks in Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, including the Shanghai Bank, Zhejiang Bank, Real Continental Bank, and Siming Bank, were 1,573,192,000 yuan in March of this year, 1,237,521,000 yuan in February, 1,118,041,000 yuan in January, 1,091,572,000 yuan in December of last year, 1,050,841,000 yuan in November, 938,354,000 yuan in October, 828,510,000 yuan in September, 748,853,000 yuan in August, 656,763,000 yuan in July, and 584,525,000 yuan in June. This proves that the banking industry's lending to various industries has increased month by month since the implementation of the new legal tender and has not decreased.</p>
<p>Commercial and Civilian Enthusiasm for Savings Week on the Fifth Day</p>
<p>The Savings Week, organized by the Central Reserve Bank with the participation of more than 160 member banks in the city, has been implemented since the 5th of this month. Businessmen and residents have been very enthusiastic about participating in savings. Because the term deposit period is short, the interest rate is generous, and there is an opportunity to win prizes through lotteries, businessmen and residents are eager to save. The deadline for the Savings Week is tomorrow (22nd) at 4 PM, so banks have been very busy accepting savings accounts recently.</p>
<p>Special Savings Lottery to Be Drawn at the End of This Month</p>
<p>In order to encourage people's interest in savings and guide idle funds into productive enterprises, the Central Savings Association has issued special prize-bearing savings bonds, each worth 50 yuan, divided into five categories. Since its launch on July 1, companies and stores in this city and other locations have been actively underwriting and selling the bonds. The general public has been very enthusiastic about buying lottery tickets. The lottery for the bonds is scheduled to be drawn publicly at the Shanghai Racecourse at 3 PM on the 30th of this month.</p>
<h3>Securities Exchange Resumes Operations Soon</h3>

<p>Preparations for the resumption of operations at the Chinese Securities Exchange are nearing completion. Chairman Zhang Weiru, who had been ill, is now working diligently despite his condition. Managing Director Shen Chang, is at the exchange daily overseeing all matters.

Other important staff members have also been internally decided and are being announced gradually.

The Ministries of Finance and Industry jointly issued an order on September 16th, appointing Chen Zhishuo, Tao Guoxian, Li Shangming, Chen Zhong, Zhong Jiaxiang, Xue Guangqian, and Xu Tianshen as members of the Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Securities Exchange, with Chen Zhishuo designated as the Chairman. The Supervisory Committee, upon receiving the order, will convene its first meeting immediately to review the types of stocks to be listed.

Classes A, B, D and E shares remained stable.</p>

<h3>Hope for Raw Material Allocation for All Industries</h3>
<p>The organizational structures of various industry associations are becoming increasingly sound. However, recently, members have expressed deep concern over the lack of necessary raw materials, which has led to operational difficulties. For example, industries such as machine-made noodles, tea pastries, and steamed bun industries have previously received approval from the Flour Food Bureau for periodic allocation of flour, oil, sugar, salt, and other raw materials. Similarly, the cotton wadding industry received approval from the Business Coordination Committee for discretionary allocation of cotton. However, months have passed without any tangible results. Therefore, various industry associations are eagerly looking forward to the timely allocation of needed raw materials to ensure the smooth operation of their members' businesses.</p>
<h3>Japanese Nationals to Pay Taxes Officially According to Chinese Tax Laws - Statement Released by the Japanese Consulate-General</h3>
<p>Shanghai News Agency (Central News Agency): The National Government is preparing to implement taxation on Japanese nationals in accordance with the treaty concluded between China and Japan at the end of July regarding the taxation of Japanese subjects. On the 10th of this month, the National Government issued its first notification to Ambassador Tani, clarifying the scope and timeline for the application of Chinese tax laws to Japanese residents in China. The Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai issued a statement on the 20th, explaining the taxes to be levied and expressing hope that Japanese nationals would cooperate with the National Government's taxation efforts. According to the July</p>
<p>Statement</p>
<p>According to Article 1 of the Supplementary Agreement on the Taxation Treaty Concerning Japanese Nationals Residing in the Republic of China, concluded on July 31st, the first notification regarding the scope of Chinese laws and regulations to be followed by Japanese nationals, as well as the applicable areas, was delivered by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government to the Imperial Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to China on the 10th of this month, as indicated in the announcement. It was also published in both the Chinese and Japanese Official Gazettes on the 20th. From this point forward, Japanese nationals in China will begin to officially pay taxes in accordance with Chinese tax laws.</p>
<p>It is unprecedented for Japanese nationals to comply with the tax laws of the Republic of China. This goes without saying, and the implementation of this measure is imminent. Therefore, it is not difficult to imagine that there will be some degree of inconvenience and difficulty due to unfamiliarity with tax laws and procedures. However, the Empire of Japan is withdrawing its extraterritorial rights in the Republic of China, assisting China in achieving its independent development as soon as possible, and working together to build a new order in East Asia with firm determination. This taxation measure is also aimed at realizing this policy. Therefore, its smooth implementation is of great significance for promoting Japan's policy towards China. It is hoped that all residents will deeply recognize the current situation, overcome any inconveniences and difficulties with a spirit of self-encouragement and cooperation, fully adapt to this new era, and contribute to the construction of Greater East Asia and the successful completion of the war effort.</p>
<p>Additionally, I would like to briefly explain some points that local residents should pay special attention to when starting to pay taxes, as follows. Please refer to the previously released treaty, supplementary agreement, explanations, and the contents of this notification to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Tax Items Related to the Jurisdiction of the Japanese Consulate-General in Shanghai</p>
<p>The tax items listed in this first notification include all central taxes (excluding Mongol cases) and some local taxes, except for income tax. Tax laws that are only implemented in North China and Mengjiang are also included in the notification. Among them, for central taxes under the jurisdiction of the Consul-General, the applicable areas are indicated as "Huazhong South," "Huazhong," "Huazhong Seven Provinces," and "National." For local taxes, except for those explicitly applicable only to the Mengjiang region, the five types mentioned all apply to the consular district of this Consul-General. However, it should be noted that those that only indicate Jiangsu Province but do not include Shanghai Municipality do not apply to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all taxes except land tax will be implemented from October 1st. The details of each tax are published in the "Explanation of Tax Laws" released by the authorities in Nanjing on the 20th, and the key points should be carefully studied.</p>
<p>Tax Items Not Recorded in This Notification</p>
<p>Among the tax items not included in this notification, those with a close relationship to the general public are income tax, business tax, land tax, house tax, food and beverage tax, and entertainment tax. Some preparations should be made or special measures taken before these taxes are levied. Once a solution is reached, a second and third notification will be issued. However, the Chinese authorities fully understand the position of the residents and are carefully studying the most appropriate method of implementation. Therefore, all residents need not feel any anxiety and should wait for the official notification before taking appropriate action.</p>
<p>Moreover, those taxes that have not been included in this notification but have been paid in the past should continue to be paid under the original names and methods in the spirit of cooperating with the Chinese side. Furthermore, taxes similar in name but having the nature of fees are not related to this notification, and Japanese nationals should pay them, which goes without saying.</p>
<p>Regarding Coercive Force on the Chinese Side</p>
<p>According to Article 2 of the Agreed Matters, the Chinese side has stipulated not to adopt administrative dispositions of coercive force for the time being. Therefore, compulsory actions such as inspections, investigations, seizures, and auctions by Chinese officials, as well as confiscations, will not be adopted for the time being. However, attention should be paid to matters indispensable to taxation techniques, such as inspecting books and requiring taxpayers to apply or provide explanations, if required by Chinese officials.</p>
<p>Measures to Ensure Tax Payment by Japanese Nationals</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Chinese side has stipulated not to use coercive force. Therefore, the Japanese side will take the necessary measures to ensure tax payment by Japanese nationals. This point is stipulated in Article 3 of the Agreed Matters, as a remedy for political matters. Therefore, it is expected that a ministerial ordinance prescribing penalties will be promulgated. However, as a temporary measure, if there is a violation of tax law, tax evasion, or delay in payment, this Consulate-General will take appropriate administrative actions. However, in order to maintain the reputation of Imperial subjects, each should exercise self-restraint to avoid the need for such measures.</p>
<p>Relationship Between the Taxes Notified This Time and the Civil Defense Tax</p>
<p>Among the tax items notified this time, only the liquor tax overlaps with the current Shanghai Civil Defense Tax. The liquor tax in China is quite high. Therefore, the method of adjustment is being considered, taking into account the increase in the burden on the general Japanese population after double taxation with the Civil Defense Tax, as well as the financial situation of the Civil Defense Corps. For other Civil Defense Taxes, they will continue to be implemented as they are before there is a notification and before the Chinese side levies an equivalent tax. In short, the adjustment of the Civil Defense Tax must be considered from two aspects: first, to avoid increasing the burden on the Japanese population due to double taxation, and second, to maintain the operation of the Civil Defense Corps without causing obstacles. However, the Chinese side fully understands the Civil Defense Corps' business, so it will not take methods that cause obstacles to the Civil Defense Corps' finances.</p>
<p>Relationship with the Former Concession Areas</p>
<p>Among the tax items listed in this notification, central taxes must be levied both inside and outside the former concession areas. However, for local taxes, those in the former International Settlement and its extended road areas, as well as the former French Concession area, are naturally not applicable. Regarding the tax laws applicable to the above-mentioned areas, they will be revised again before further notification. Therefore, residents living in those areas should continue to pay the assessments of the former Shanghai Municipal Council or the former French Municipal Council as donations, as instructed in the August 1st notification from this Consulate-General. Furthermore, if there are any unclear matters or questions regarding the Chinese taxation issue, please ask the relevant officials of this Consulate-General for clarification.</p>

<h3>The Training of Young Pilot Soldiers - Beautiful Children of God</h3>
<p>There is infinite beauty in the world, and within that beauty lies the figure of the young pilot soldier. This beauty is wonderful in its "simplicity and plainness"... I am probably not the only one who feels this way!</p>
<p>The figures of the young men clothed in flight suits show no signs of affectation. Just the brown uniforms and caps suitable for flight in the sky, and the green belt-shaped parachutes. There's nothing useless about it.</p>
<p>For these simple and beautiful young pilot soldiers, we can only perceive their awe-inspiring presence and natural beauty.</p>
<p>Apart from all outward beauty, the spiritual beauty of these young men can be imagined simply from their magnificent and unparalleled battles on the southern and northern fronts.</p>
<p>Any mother in the world who sees their imposing and majestic appearance on the airfield, or sees their training in the sky, will have her heart moved even if she does not hear about them fighting in the heart-stopping battlefields. The son who was raised from infancy has been transformed into a valiant and high-spirited young man, and the mother will be surprised and respectful, even feeling confused, wondering if he is really her son. There is a saying called "divine soldier," and they are truly "children of God."</p>
<h3>Starting in the Sky Only After Thorough Ground Training</h3>
<p>Before the little swallow flies into the sky, it must first undergo a long period of training. Before taking their first flight in a practice plane, young pilot soldiers also undergo a rigorous ground training. They climb into the aircraft model of the ground trainer and practice various techniques. This ground trainer is connected to a recorder that records the track, and the young men's driving conditions are displayed on the instructor's desk by the instrument's needle.</p>
<p>Nothing is neglected. If this ground driving training is not fully understood, one cannot fly in the sky. If you are careless or unskilled, flaws will occur in aerial flight. As long as the technique is excellent, nothing is as safe as an airplane. Every day, who knows how many planes are flying, and the number of accidents and sacrifices is almost one in ten thousand. It is definitely not a dangerous thing. This is what the instructors at the Kumagaya Flying School say.</p>
<h3>The Reporting Sound is Full of Beautiful Tension and Vitality</h3>
<p>People call young pilot soldiers the divine soldiers of this world. The purity and freshness of the young soul is more beautiful and precious than anything else on earth. The figure of the young pilot soldier is probably the one that can fully exert this soul!</p>
<p>Discipline, order, courage, and all other beautiful and valiant spirits can be fully expressed in the attitude of reporting to the instructor after completing flight training. Four or five young men stand side by side a few steps away from the instructor. After saluting, they report. The brisk movements, the loud voices, the different personalities, physiques, and appearances of each person. The sincere expressions and faithful reports show that there is no hypocrisy or emptiness here.</p>
<p>In the sound of the report, there is a moment filled with wonderful tension and the vitality of life.</p>
<p>National Forum</p>
<h3>Cultivating Technical Talents</h3>
<p>— Qin Mu</p>
<p>Currently, China is universally aware of the lack of technical talent, which is of great importance to the future construction of the new China.</p>
<p>Young people in our country who have received higher education often adhere to vain ideas and are unwilling to start from the bottom after graduation, always trying to find shortcuts. As for low-level technical personnel, they often remain stuck in their ways, unwilling to improve, and also lack opportunities for further study. As a result, senior personnel lack the skills and experience and can only handle routine matters; junior personnel lack the knowledge and qualifications to develop their talents. Consequently, various industries lack technical talent.</p>
<p>A young person engaged in industry who avoids practical training in the factory and immediately jumps to a management or planning position is actually destroying his own potential for advancement, because a technical person without intimate technical knowledge and without understanding the work of those below cannot be competent in a high position. A factory manager who has not experienced the work of all departments in the factory himself cannot completely manage the factory.</p>
<p>On the other hand, those who are in charge of guidance in the factory must encourage their subordinates to advance and give them opportunities for training. This will definitely increase work efficiency. If people are employed without regard to talent and are only favored based on personal connections, then those with ambition and talent will inevitably be disappointed and frustrated. Not only will true talent be buried, but it will also harm the business itself and the entire country.</p>
<p>Education in China has been promoted for decades, and the current shortage of technical personnel must also be attributed to the lack of a proper educational system. There are few vocational secondary schools, and most secondary schools are general. This has created some "people who can do everything but do nothing well." Building more vocational schools is also the most appropriate way to cultivate technical talent.</p>

<p>Shaoxing Native Association in Shanghai: In view of the low educational level of young employees (such as shop assistants, trainees, waiters, deliverymen, etc.), who are limited in their progress and unable to study, the Association has created the Zijiashan Supplementary Night School at 5 Juyi Lane, Lloyd Road, with the aim of promoting universal education. Therefore, the fees are quite low, with only 30 yuan for tuition and miscellaneous fees per term. It has been reported that the school will add ten half-fee and free students to each class in Chinese, English, Japanese, mathematics, and other levels. Those who aspire to study but are limited by their finances can quickly apply to the school and will be admitted after an examination.</p>
<p>Jinxiu Vocational Supplementary School, 480 Nanjing Road, in response to general demand, has opened a special weekend class, teaching practical and useful skills. Registration has begun and classes start on the 26th.</p>
<p>Lost Keys: A bunch of keys, totaling more than ten, was found at the intersection of Great Laidar Road and Albert Road. The loser is requested to claim them at Yue's residence, 622 Great Laidar Road (intersection of Raoul Road).</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern, I read in your publication on September 7th that someone accused my work "Evil Grievance" (original title "Home Female Teacher") of plagiarizing a section from the "American Piece" in Gong Shenzhou's National Light Society's Contemporary Novel Collection, Volume 3. After reading this, I was extremely surprised. After investigation, the article is indeed written by me and is based on real facts, not a castle in the air, and I am not paid for it. I am forced to make a statement.</p>
<p>Take off continuously</p>
<p>The aircraft taking off into the sky</p>
<p>In the hot summer, the sun beats down. The young men climb into the plane, causing a rumbling sound. At the sound of the takeoff command, they immediately straddle the yellow trainer and taxi forward. They fly straight into the sky. The planes traveling with them either drill into the clouds or fall like leaves, appearing and disappearing, each showing their skills. A large group of planes, with yellow bodies and rumbling engines, are like a swarm of bees flying.</p>
<p>At the southern sea, the fires of war are raging, and every senior is constantly fighting to the death, so we cannot hesitate or slack off for a moment. In the eyes of the young flying soldiers, there is nothing else. They only know! "Follow the seniors and destroy the British and Americans." With a resolute spirit, they are determined to go to the battlefield.</p>
<p>Strong body and sound spirit are indispensable</p>
<p>Do constant flying soldiers have special conditions? No, no special conditions are required. They only need to have a strengthened body and an incomparably sound spirit. Young people of the world! All of you must ignite the true heart of patriotism. Come and be the young flying soldiers of the infinitely beautiful and precious "children of God," and be a warrior to defend the motherland.
