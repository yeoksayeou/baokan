<h3 id="c1">論全面和平 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 松軒</p>
<p>「為保衛東亞計，東亞民族不應當相仇；為復興中華計，全面和平尤應早日實現」！這是日前汪主席赴日訪問後發表談話中極重要的兩句話。在汪主席的領導之下，無非為了促成中日兩國的全面和平，以求復興中華，保衛東亞。近年國際局勢與國內情形雖然巳有極大的變化，然而促成全面和平以及中日協力保衛東亞，始終是中國民族解放運動乃至東亞民族解放運動中的最主要的任務。特別是在今日，世界大戰巳臨於決戰階段，而在東亞戰塲上，敵人更高唱所謂「太平洋總反攻」，公然企圖以我國大陸及領空為他們對日決戰的塲所，因此，中日兩國實現全而和平以消滅英美這種殘忍的野心，實為今日最重要的任務之一。汪主席二十三日談話之特別提示「全面和平尤應早日實現」，無疑是中日兩國乃至東亞全足族共同的要求。</p>
<p>「全面和平尤應早日實現」，決不祇是政府領袖少數人的要求，而是全國人民共同的期待。首先，就和平區的人民說，因為和平運動促成了最近日本的對華新政策，乃有交還租界，撤廢治外法權等新事實。但是，中華民族是整體的，不能分裂的，每一念及重慶統治下的人民，早巳不必要的戰爭還在自己國內進行，大家的心裏，總不免深深的印着一個黑影。這種黑影，只有實現全面和平，才能完全消減。同時，這種全面和平的渴望，更在重慶政權下的人民中間普遍的滋生。長期的無望的拖戰，人民所受的苦痛是不忍設想的。</p>
<p>「早日實現全面和平」，雖為今日全國上下一致的要求，而且也是友邦日本共同的要求，可是，為什麼這幾年來還沒有早日實現呢？過去的事，現在不必提了，從最近的事實來說，廠結所在，不在日本，不在南京國府，而另有其應負責者。自從汪主席發表艷電，以至國民政府還都以來，深信一部分政府領袖對於全面和平未稍或忘，而始終思慮有以促成之道。從日本而言，雖然沒有「大西洋憲章」那種炫人心目的東西，但是交還租界，撤廢治外法權，舉凡為我國人民所要求的，幾乎都巳盡其力量逐漸促其實現；對華新政策巳在事實上證明了日本的眞意。</p>
<p>然則全面和平能不能早日實現，這個問題的關鍵在什麼地方呢？老實說，不在日方也不在國府，而在於重慶政權！重慶政權，裏面包含着國際為背景的許多不同的成份，然而今日處於領導地位的，顯然只有以美英為背景的宋美齡與宋子文一派，具有着支配政局的實力。因此我們發覺極可注意的兩種趨向。第一種，是阻碍與破壞全面和平的趨向，要的是：　重慶政權的實權操在英美派的宋美齡宋子文等手中，耍實現全面和平必須以此為對象，但是，英美派的覺悟顯然尙非其時，何况，美國正在對渝實行新的借款，企圖加强英美派的政治力量，阻礙全面和平呢！　重慶政權中屆於重要地位的實力派，尙有黃埔系的何應欽尤其是胡宗南等，他們也絕無放棄東亞民族自相殘殺之「拖戰　的決心。　重慶政權下誠然有不少知日派的份子，特別如張岳軍吳鼎昌諸氏，如果他們參加中央政權，也可能促成全面和平，然而目前他們都只掌持地方政權，對中央政策沒有決定的力量。因此，欲重慶政權放棄拖戰，實現全面和平，現在尙非其時。第二種是可能促成全面和平的趨向，這趨向是基於一反共相同」的因素上，比較有其可能性。可是，僅憑這「反共相同」的因素，事實上極不易因此促成全面和平的。</p>
<p>不過，為了促成全成全面和平，在上術基本認識之外，我們必須進一步認淸：第一，重慶政權為一蔣介石個人的獨裁政權，所以人民雖然渴望全面和平之早日實現，可是現在還無力轉變蔣介的的拖戰政策。第二，重慶政權又為美英勢力所支配，實際上本身甚少自主力，所以全面和平之實現，必須先從國際關係下手，決無不顧國際關係而有實現可能。第三，如前所述，目前英美份子抬頭，與英美不可分離，而且還有實力派黃埔系在支持着，試問現在重慶政權內誰來談全面和平？是張羣？是何應欽或胡宗南？還是宋子文或蔣介石本人？除了這些實力派之外，其他自命重慶有關係的政客流氓，不過善於利用「掛羊頭賣狗肉」的投機技倆而巳，和他們接觸，只不過為他們所欺，給他們對英美及內地人民做宣傳資料，企圖增加自身在政治上的地位而巳！</p>
<p>所以從大局言，我們認為早日實現全面和平的要求，異常迫切，我們必須一刻不可或忘，而且必須盡一切心力以促共早日實現。但鑒於渝方的實情，却還沒有充分的可能性。我們必須指出：任何基於幻想之上的計劃尤其是對重慶政權的期待，是落空的。我們今日一方面固然要盡力督促渝方覺悟，但更重要的還是要使和平區的政治上軌道，保障人民最低限度的生活。我們相信，只要日本對華新政策澈底實現，只要國府政治上軌道，人民生活改善了，那麼，全面和平實現之期，一定是不會太遠的，語云：「欲速則不達」，如果僅僅躁急的期待與活動，對於早日實現全面和平是無益的。</p>

<p>瑞典京城二十五日中央社電　此間政界人士對邱吉爾首相改組內閣事，最使人驚訝者，乃皮佛勃　克之重返內閣。倫敦政界人士以為此舉，與　待舉行之三强會議不無有　，因皮氏嘗贊成與莫斯科密切合作，且對成歐洲開闢第二戰綫一事，宣傳不遺餘力。衆信皮氏所任堂爾大臣一職，所屬並無特殊部份，故邱吉爾乃欲利用其担任談判及其他特殊使命。至於此次內閣改組，在內政上而言，則為英政府更形加强共保守勢力，而該政府之各黨聯合政治性，已僅存為標語矣。阿特里被任爲皇室事務大臣後，其勢力巳被削弱，惟克倫巴恩之地位則增强。克氏為保守黨之有力份子，且爲外相艾登之鞏友。勞氏之晋級，據云亦與三强會議有關，渠將與外相保持密切之接觸。其他特殊事件，乃邱吉爾首相自握權以來，此為第一次以財相加入戰時內閣。眾認此舉乃指出英國於反軸心國戰後計劃中之財政政策之重要性，已較一九四〇年為甚。</p>

<p>此次友邦日本大政　贊會決定綜合食糧對策大綱，對於中國食糧問題之施策，則以農業技術上之指導與協助為其核心，所以，於其考慮之施策中，有知下一節：「在華中方面，以日本之農業技術加以協力，藉謀農業生產之向上，」原來，　中為全國膏腴之地，天然出產，本無什麽問題，可是，要農產物在質與景兩方面的增適，則非改進中國的農業技術不為功。所以，我們對於「中堅農民」之訓練，主張側重他們對於改良耕種方法的興趣，對於增進農業質量的常識，就是這個意思。友邦日本能以其優越之經騐，予以農業技術之協力，認為直當可遇而不可求了。</p>
<p>以上是從食糧問題的遠處大處着想，其次，則為食糧問題的切近點，就是當前的米糧統制機構，其最近的發展，為米糧採辦同業公曾籌備委員會人選之決定與要綱之公佈。米糧統制之成功與否，正如糧食部顧部長所說：「端賴其下部機構，即地方收買業者之活動　何．」此外，則有顆於軍當局全面之支持協力。關於此點，我們極爲感級中國派遣軍當局談話中的幾句：「凡素質優良之米商，……如對之橫加迫害，或妨碍其收買運輸等情事，並當採取斷然之措置。」這樣一個協力，又常認為可迪而不可求了。</p>

<p>股市轉機</p>
<p>華股市塲自受妝買紗布影響趨於凋零以來，至今已逾一月，在此一月餘中，市况之困疲，尤以上星期為最轉，而自本週一起、始呈象蘚之象。</p>
<p>市塲一瞥</p>
<p>昨日為週六，股票市塲，僅有半日交易、依照慣例，則週六之股市，必較隔日為瘦。然昨日股市即上升甚勁，至十時半以後見最高價，其後雖逢高有人吐售，致價漸同落，但各股終較上日仍為軋升。且收市以後，仍不乏買戶，脚地殊穩，故一般預測</p>
<p>認為下週內之股市可望更形堅挺。</p>

<p>為開發世界上唯一　殘剩的黑暗地域的資源　第一次獨立業已告終。新幾尼亞民政府動員　日本學術界的精銳，翻織「資源調查學術探險隊」自到　常地以來，業已數月，踏破　莽未　闢的密林，進入瘴癘邇地，蠻雨連天的神秘之境，忍受着言語所不能形容的勞苦，而獲得誇耀於世界的成果。現在第一次調查業巳吿終。</p>
<p>黑世界的眞相</p>
<p>此次探　，乃是在擊滅英美的第一綫上，實行資源調查，故在世界探險史上，具有劃時代的意義。隊員以必死的覺悟，努力不懈，克　一切題　面前　，其結果，　　藥　次調查，未曾發見有何資源，而予以放棄的　　暗區，不僅陸　發見了許多必要的重要資源，世界地圖上剩下的　神秘之境的空白部份，以前一向當作「世界的黑暗地界」的眞相，今始大白。即在學術上，英美，荷蘭也巳經戰敗了，他們以前的調查。現在發見了許多的錯誤與不完全，日本高奏着科學勝利的凱歌。此次所採集的許多鑛物·動物·植物的標本，遠在荷蘭，美國之上，近止着手整理，將與照片等一同出版「研究報告」，向全世辦謗小「東亞科學」的優秀　。</p>
<p>遊山玩水不辭艱辛</p>
<p>新幾尼亞以前會有荷印學術協會，荷蘭陸軍探險隊，美國的阿蒂鮑爾特等各探險隊，數次進行大規模的探險，他們的調查方法，或用飛機飛行，或在基地上作為跳舞塲那樣充滿着遊山玩水的調查氣雾。新幾尼亞民政府的調查隊，如地質·鑛物·動物·植物·農業·林業·人類廖等各班，他們的忍受着一切的困苦·缺乏，而進行眞正的調查。</p>
<p>如礦物·岩石·動物·植物等貴重的學術標本，煞費苦心從西幾尼亞各地　集的，實　數萬種之多。超過阿蒂鮑爾特所蒐集的數千點之上。如地質圖等，以前的空白部分，除最初所　埋的以外，荷蘭的調查所用的地質　，發見了很多的錯誤，而加以訂　。</p>
<p>又荷蘭的報吿中說新幾尼亞火成岩地帶頗少，故金屬資源甚多貧弱。這說數已　本推翻，金屬資源已陸續發見。如石炭，也從荷蘭調查隊所未曾發見的成所有許多地方發見質地優良的石炭。石油普通常戰多以爲砂岩　中含有着，但在此地，珊瑚礁中亦會有石油。荷蘭的調查，雖經過的範圍極廣，但竟不如道。而月和石油有密切關係的「有　　化石一，也在西新幾尼亞各地發見，暗示該地有豐富的油田，故意義頗爲重大。</p>
<p>地質是珊瑚礁</p>
<p>同時，四幾尼亞的地質　造，亦因此而明瞭，道也是學術界的收獲。新幾尼亞全境是　瑚　長成的，離今約二十萬年前的第三紀，在六千米海底的東西，變成拔海五千米的高山，　在白雪　頂的中央山脈加爾史登茲山頂上，尚殘剩着當時海底的粘土。所以在新幾尼亞，有着自從地球長成昧最初的遠古時代以至現在為止的各時代的珊瑚礁。可視為珊瑚礁的自然博物館。熱帶地質，熱帶地下資源的研究，不能把珊瑚礁的研究除外，此在南方科學的前遂，投下了一道光明。誠是偉大的收獲。</p>
<p>水力木材取之不盡</p>
<p>水力資源因有　富的水流，故可　到遠越日本本國之上的電力。從千古未　斧　的原始林中，知道有取之不盡，用之不竭的有用水材農塲的農耕地也很豐富。而且　別的熱帶不同，如米，甘蔣，馬鈴薯，　　，甜菜，山芋，茄子等，無不應　　有。這是由於農業班的調查可證明的。</p>
<p>又因人類班的調查，以前新幾尼亞被當作　人的老巢，現在亦被完全推翻。原居民的體力智能，意料之外的俊秀，食人，獵人首等舊習，此後不再復現。文化亦相當進步，為建設東亞的戰士之優秀人種·（翔：　自九月十二日東京讀賣報知）</p>

<h3 id="c52">改良大學薪給制度 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— 張啓揚</p>
<p>大學為一國的最高學府，大學敎授爲文化的導師。其所負使命如何神聖與重大、其在社會上之地位又該是如何的祟高。此乃盡人皆知之眞理。雖鄉夫婦人，走販苦工，對於大學敎授，雖不瞭解其使命，然每肅然起敬，視若聖人者，豈知世代凌夷，今之大學敎授薪金之菲薄，使彼等整月整日，為生活而聲嘶力竭，講授學理。</p>
<p>一個人的精力究屢有限：若此忙碌，如何使其悉心講授，更如何使其於授課外精益求精，研討學她，以其所得買獻於社會團族。此不啻社會人類之　大損失。考其原因，實由於學府當局之重視營利觀念，而薪給制度之沿習成規，不思有以改善，以適合物價高漲下之現實社會。茲就管見所及一會改　之方法。</p>
<p>今日各大學完全以鐘點計算薪金，而薪金之規定又甚菲薄。余以爲一面當然以鐘點為準則，一面須以聽認該科員生之多實，給予額外之待遇。譬如某科有八十名學生聽講，每生學費八百元，雜費二百元。以八百元之學費將選修十八個學分為標凖平均之(按十八學分係部頒標凖）則每一學分約四十四元，設該科三個學分，共計一百三十二元。以上述八十人乘之，則得一萬零五百六十元。再以此總數二份分之每份為五千二百八十元。以一份給予敎授，一份校方作為職員校役之薪金。易言之，即以鐘點（即學分）為計算之標準，而薪給則廢止鐘點，以每學期六個月計算之。</p>
<p>本學期一般大學每鐘點四十元，照上述計算則每鐘點七十三元三角强。其待遇之增高可見。</p>
<p>惟依上述之薪給制度，尙發生若干問題。不得不申述者：</p>
<p>大學有共同必修如一年級之外國語國文等，人數必多。各系科必修人數次之，選修更次之。（此就一般而論）豈非發生不均勻之現貌，而影響教薪　渥寡少。余以為聽　生四十人以上者以上述方法計算，四十人以下者學校與教授不能均分，敎授得三分之二，校方得三分之一。人數過分之學科，於學費利息項下，學交盈餘項下，及學校基金項下酌予額外給予。務使典最高之薪余柞近。</p>
<p>依據此薪給制度，學校尙有相常盈餘。如本學　某大學有一千餘人，雜費二百元，計二十萬元，足夠房金水電一切雜發開支而有餘。學費八百元，計八十萬元，如三分之二爲敎薪，學校尙有約二十六萬元，亦足夠付給職工薪金而有餘。此就學校經常維持不得不顧全者也</p>
<p>再依目前物價之高漲，為顧全敎授職工待遇及學校開支起見，祇少應收學雜費一千元，於良心上並無內疚。</p>
<p>未了，願各界人士。學校當局，及敎授們貢獻高見，以使大學薪給得以改善。</p>

<h3 id="e1">On Total Peace <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Songxuan</p>
<p>"To protect East Asia, East Asian peoples should not hate each other; to revive China, total peace should be realized as soon as possible!" These are two extremely important sentences in Chairman Wang's speech after his recent visit to Japan. Under the leadership of Chairman Wang, everything is done to promote total peace between China and Japan, in order to revive China and protect East Asia. Although the international situation and domestic conditions have changed greatly in recent years, promoting total peace and Sino-Japanese cooperation to protect East Asia has always been the most important task in the Chinese national liberation movement and even the East Asian national liberation movement. Especially today, when the world war is approaching a decisive stage, and on the East Asian battlefield, the enemy is even singing the so-called "Pacific General Counter-Offensive," openly attempting to use our mainland and airspace as their battlefield for the decisive battle against Japan. Therefore, the realization of total peace between China and Japan to eliminate the cruel ambition of the United Kingdom and the United States is one of the most important tasks today. Chairman Wang's special reminder on the 23rd that "total peace should be realized as soon as possible" is undoubtedly a common demand of both China and Japan, and even the entire East Asian community.</p>
<p>"Total peace should be realized as soon as possible" is by no means just the demand of a few government leaders, but the common expectation of the people across the country. First of all, for the people in the peaceful areas, the peace movement has promoted Japan's new policy towards China, resulting in new realities such as the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality. However, the Chinese nation is a whole and cannot be split. Every time we think of the people under the rule of Chongqing, where an unnecessary war is still being waged in their own country, everyone cannot help but have a dark shadow deeply imprinted in their hearts. This shadow can only be completely dispelled by realizing total peace. At the same time, this desire for total peace is also universally growing among the people under the Chongqing regime. The long-term, hopeless dragging war is causing unimaginable suffering to the people.</p>
<p>"Realizing total peace as soon as possible" is not only a consistent demand of the entire country today, but also a common demand of friendly country Japan. However, why has it not been realized sooner in recent years? We don't need to mention the past. Judging from recent facts, the key lies not in Japan, not in the Nanjing National Government, but elsewhere, with those who should be held responsible. Since Chairman Wang published his "radiant telegram" and the National Government returned to the capital, it is believed that some government leaders have never forgotten the importance of total peace and have always been thinking about ways to promote it. As far as Japan is concerned, although there is nothing as dazzling as the "Atlantic Charter," it has done its best to gradually promote the realization of almost everything requested by our people, such as the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality. The new policy towards China has already proven Japan's true intentions in practice.</p>
<p>So, where does the key to whether total peace can be realized as soon as possible lie? To be honest, it lies neither with the Japanese side nor with the National Government, but with the Chongqing regime! The Chongqing regime contains many different elements with international backgrounds. However, today, those in leadership positions are clearly the Soong Mei-ling and Soong Tzu-wen factions, backed by the United States and the United Kingdom, who have the power to dominate the political situation. Therefore, we have discovered two very noteworthy trends. The first is the trend of obstructing and undermining total peace. The reason is: The real power of the Chongqing regime is in the hands of the pro-British and American factions of Soong Mei-ling and Soong Tzu-wen. To realize total peace, they must be the target. However, the awakening of the pro-British and American factions is clearly not yet the time. Moreover, the United States is implementing new loans to Chongqing in an attempt to strengthen the political power of the pro-British and American factions and hinder total peace! Among the influential figures in important positions in the Chongqing regime, there are also He Yingqin, especially Hu Zongnan, and others from the Whampoa clique. They have absolutely no determination to abandon the "dragging war" of East Asian peoples killing each other. Indeed, there are many pro-Japanese figures under the Chongqing regime, especially figures such as Zhang Yuejun and Wu Dingchang. If they participated in the central government, they might be able to promote total peace. However, at present, they only hold local government positions and have no decision-making power over central policies. Therefore, it is not yet time for the Chongqing regime to abandon the dragging war and realize total peace. The second is the trend that may promote total peace. This trend is based on the factor of "common anti-communism" and is relatively more likely. However, based solely on the factor of "common anti-communism," it is actually extremely difficult to promote total peace.</p>
<p>However, in order to promote total peace, in addition to the above basic understanding, we must further recognize: First, the Chongqing regime is an autocratic regime of Chiang Kai-shek alone. Therefore, although the people yearn for the early realization of total peace, they are still unable to change Chiang Kai-shek's dragging war policy. Second, the Chongqing regime is also dominated by the forces of the United States and the United Kingdom and actually has little autonomy. Therefore, the realization of total peace must first start with international relations, and there is no possibility of realization without regard to international relations. Third, as mentioned earlier, the pro-British and American elements are on the rise, inseparable from the United States and the United Kingdom, and there is also the powerful Whampoa clique supporting them. So, who in the Chongqing regime will talk about total peace now? Is it Zhang Qun? Is it He Yingqin or Hu Zongnan? Or is it Soong Tzu-wen or Chiang Kai-shek himself? Apart from these influential figures, other self-proclaimed politicians and hooligans who have relationships with Chongqing are only good at using the opportunistic trick of "selling dog meat under the pretense of selling mutton." Contacting them is only to be deceived by them and to provide them with propaganda materials for the United States, the United Kingdom, and the people in the mainland, in an attempt to increase their own political status!</p>
<p>Therefore, from the overall situation, we believe that the demand for realizing total peace as soon as possible is extremely urgent. We must never forget it for a moment and must do everything in our power to promote its early realization. However, in view of the actual situation in Chongqing, there is still not enough possibility. We must point out that any plan based on fantasy, especially expectations of the Chongqing regime, is doomed to fail. Today, while we must do our best to urge Chongqing to wake up, it is even more important to put politics in the peaceful areas on the right track and guarantee the people's minimum standard of living. We believe that as long as Japan's new policy towards China is thoroughly implemented, as long as the National Government's politics are on the right track, and as long as the people's livelihood improves, the date for the realization of total peace will not be too far away. As the saying goes, "Haste makes waste." If we only expect and act impatiently, it will not help to realize total peace as soon as possible.</p>

The original telegrams are recorded below: To His Excellency Ba Maw, National Representative of Myanmar: We are pleased to learn that your country will celebrate its independence starting from September 25. We extend our warmest congratulations. Since your country eliminated the invasion of tyrannical England and achieved glorious independence, it has actively participated in the war and shared the hardships. We firmly believe that the Greater East Asia War will be completed sooner because of this. We hereby send this telegram to express our congratulations and wish your country prosperity and your Excellency good health. Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the National Government of the Republic of China. To His Excellency Ba Maw, Head of the Independent Government of Myanmar, Yangon, via Myanmar: With the help of our friendly nation Japan, your country has eliminated the invading forces of the United Kingdom and the United States, restored its homeland, and achieved independent liberation. From now on, it will join hands with other East Asian nations to advance. The completion of the Greater East Asia War and the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere can be predicted. We hereby send this telegram to express our congratulations and wish your country prosperity. Zhou Xuechang, Deputy Secretary-General of the East Asia League of China, respectfully.</p>
<p>Bangkok, September 25 (Central News Agency) Thai Foreign Minister Wattana today sent a telegram to the Myanmar Foreign Minister, stating: I have learned that your country is holding a celebration of independence. I hereby extend my congratulations on behalf of the government and the people. Because of this independence, Myanmar will have rapid progress in all aspects and achieve prosperity. I firmly believe that this is also a great honor for Buddhists among all Asian nations.</p>
<p>The First Day of Celebration</p>
<p>Yangon, September 25 (Central News Agency) The Myanmar government, in order to celebrate its independence and boost morale, will hold national celebrations of its independence for one week starting from the 25th. The 25th was the first day. Myanmar celebrated throughout the country, flying national flags everywhere. Celebrations were held in various parts of the country at 9:30 am, presided over by National Representative Ba Maw. Representatives from various government agencies and organizations attended, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. After the meeting began, the Declaration of Independence and the Proclamation of War against the United Kingdom and the United States were read. Resolutions were passed to thank the Japanese government and the Japanese military officers and soldiers, and silent prayers were offered to the spirits of the Japanese and Myanmar war dead. Subsequently, Ambassador Takeda, representing the Japanese government, delivered a congratulatory speech. During this celebration period, there will also be medical fairs, concerts, sports meets, and film screenings. Various radio stations will also hold special broadcasts.</p>
<p>Ambassador Takeda's Congratulatory Speech</p>
<p>Yangon, September 25 (Central News Agency) The 25th was the first day of Myanmar's celebration of independence. The celebration in Yangon was personally chaired by National Representative Ba Maw. Japanese Ambassador to Myanmar, Takeda, attended and delivered a congratulatory speech, the gist of which is as follows: Today is the day when our allied nation, Myanmar, is holding a grand ceremony to celebrate its independence. I hereby express my congratulations on behalf of the Japanese government. Since your country declared its independence to the world on the first day of this month, more than ten countries have recognized Myanmar's independence in less than ten days. This is unprecedented in the establishment of a new country, and it is truly the most commendable thing for Myanmar. Upon achieving independence, Myanmar immediately concluded a treaty of alliance with Japan and made cooperation in completing the Greater East Asia War its highest national policy. As for various domestic policies to adapt to the current situation, they are also being implemented gradually, first seeking to establish a national mobilization system from both material and spiritual aspects. Your country also issued a statement regarding the surrender of Italy's Badoglio, condemning its betrayal and expressing its firm determination to cooperate with the alliance and fight to the end. This is the most powerful expression of your country, and it is also the spirit of National Representative Ba Maw and all cabinet members working hard for the country. I hereby express my deepest congratulations to your country.</p>

<h3 id="e4">Assembly Passes Resolution of Gratitude to Japan <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Manila, September 25 (Central News Agency) The Philippine National Assembly yesterday passed a resolution of gratitude to the Japanese government, the gist of which is as follows: After the Philippine Revolutionary Army defeated the Spanish army, it adopted the Malolos Constitution in July 1889. When the Philippines fought against the United States, the constitution was cancelled due to the Philippine defeat. Thereafter, the Philippines continued to promote the independence movement and continued to adopt the constitution. Although the Philippine Commonwealth was established in 1935, it failed to become a completely independent country. After the Japanese army entered the Philippines in 1942, it immediately agreed to allow the Philippines to become independent and allowed the adoption of a draft constitution. The Philippine National Assembly is deeply grateful to Japan for assisting the Philippine people in building a new Philippines and allowing its independence. Therefore, the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army in the Philippines is requested to forward this to the Japanese government.</p>
<p>Laurel's Biography</p>

<p>Berlin, September 25 (Central News Agency) Albania has declared independence. It is rumored that the German government intends to recognize Albania's independence soon. Albania was annexed by Italy before this European war. Germany's intention is to respect the consciousness of the Albanian nation and hope that it will become a new unit in the new European order.</p>

<p>Berlin, September 25 (Central News Agency) On the 24th, the German military authorities announced the situation of banditry in the Balkans, stating: Due to the weakness of the Italian army, bandits in the Balkan region have gradually become more disruptive. The German army has begun sweeping operations against them. These bandits only engage in looting, and now they dare to attack German army outposts. However, when the German army counterattacks, they adopt guerrilla tactics to resist cunningly. Therefore, sweeping operations have now begun in eastern Bosnia, Dalmatia, and parts of Croatia. The German army is cutting off the bandits' retreat in eastern Bosnia and will wipe them out in one fell swoop. To date, a total of 1,200 bandits have been eliminated, and hundreds have been captured.</p>
<h3 id="e15">British Wartime Cabinet Reorganized Anderson Appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer Beaverbrook Re-enters Cabinet <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, September 25 (Central News Agency) According to reports from London, London announced last night that Lord President of the Council Anderson has been appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer to succeed Sir Kingsley Wood, who recently passed away. Anderson's vacant position will be concurrently held by Deputy Prime Minister Attlee. There have also been other changes in the cabinet. Secretary of State for Air Cranborne has been transferred to Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, and his vacant position has been filled by Lord Beaverbrook, who has re-entered the cabinet. Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Law has been appointed as Deputy Foreign Secretary with ministerial rank. Chancellor of the Exchequer Anderson and Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs will join the wartime cabinet, and the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs will retain his original position as Speaker of the House of Lords. The announcement also stated that Casey will be given the title of Minister of State Resident in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, September 25 (Central News Agency) Political figures here are most surprised by Churchill's cabinet reshuffle by the return of Beaverbrook to the cabinet. London political figures believe that this move is not unrelated to the upcoming Three-Power Conference, as Beaverbrook has always advocated close cooperation with Moscow and has spared no effort in advocating the opening of a second front in Europe. It is believed that Beaverbrook's position as Secretary of State has no special part, so Churchill wants to use him to undertake negotiations and other special missions. As for this cabinet reshuffle, in terms of domestic politics, it means that the British government has further strengthened its conservative forces, and the party coalition politics of the government have only remained as slogans. After Attlee was appointed Lord President of the Council, his power has been weakened, but Cranborne's position has been strengthened. Cranborne is a powerful figure in the Conservative Party and a close friend of Foreign Secretary Eden. Law's promotion is also said to be related to the Three-Power Conference, and he will maintain close contact with the Foreign Secretary. Another special event is that this is the first time since Churchill took power that a Chancellor of the Exchequer has joined the wartime cabinet.

<p>Berlin, September 25 (Central News Agency) Today's official announcement stated that German rear guard troops withdrew from the cities of Smolensk and Roslavl last night after completing the most important withdrawal measures and destroying all facilities of military importance.</p>
<p>Berlin, September 25 (Central News Agency) German News Agency reports: The Soviet army is mobilizing all available troops, regardless of any sacrifices, and continued to attack the German army's iron defense line on Thursday, making every effort to achieve one of the two goals of its summer offensive, namely, to recover Ukraine or to destroy large units of the German army.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Shorten Supply Lines, Strengthen Defense <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, October 25th, Central News Agency: A German news agency reports that the current situation on the Eastern Front shows that the German High Command plans to adjust its battle lines, which will give the war a new look. Therefore, regarding the development of the central and southern sections of the Eastern Front, the German army is fiercely carrying out its tactics of avoiding engagement. Although the pressure from the Soviet army is great at certain points, the situation on the German left wing, between Bely and Rzhev, is not affected. This fact "has great significance, because the German army has not changed in this area, so the Soviets cannot fathom the German intentions. This should be viewed in conjunction with the increasingly obvious counter-offensive actions of the German army. The Soviets will soon realize what their position is under the large-scale German retreat. The Soviet army has now gained considerable land, but in exchange for a high price and huge material losses, and the occupied areas have been razed to the ground by the German army. As winter and the rainy season approach, the German army has now gained a more advantageous position, and its supply lines have been greatly shortened. The war on the Eastern Front will soon be able to show its nature, that is, the problem of solving transportation and supply is paramount. The Soviet army has been lured by the German army to the banks of the Dnieper River, and behind the Soviet army, it is as desolate as the Sahara Desert. The German army still remaining on the northern front line is exerting great pressure and restraint on the central route, which the Soviet army will be able to feel. The detailed procedures of the German army are often not mentioned in military terms, and the large-scale shortening of the battle line not only strengthens its combat power, but also strengthens the defense of Europe.</p>

<p>Lisbon, October 25th, Central News Agency: The Southern Italian front has been relatively calm recently, but the opportunity for war seems to have gradually matured. Berlin sources also reported that a great war in that area is imminent. According to a Reuters report from Algiers, a second fierce battle is about to begin north of Salerno. The Anglo-American forces are extremely worried about the capture of Naples after a major defeat in the Battle of Salerno, because the German army has built strong fortifications south of the Volturno River, and the Allied advance is being prevented. Therefore, they are currently strengthening their forces, seemingly attempting to break through the German positions with superior firepower. According to sources in Algiers, new troops from the U.S. Fifth Army have landed in the Amalfi area and along the coast of Salerno in recent days, and have repeatedly moved north and to the front lines to the north, especially north of Salerno, where strong artillery units have been deployed, with the potential to launch a fierce attack on the German positions. The center of the war is the Volturno River basin and the Avellino-Potenza area north of Salerno. Current battles are all small-scale conflicts, but the Allied actions in the area from Avellino to the Volturno River valley are quite active, and it is expected that the most recent fierce battle will begin in this area first.</p>

The Japanese team first played the French team. Secretary-General Shu Yong, representing Mayor Chen, Director Mo Cun of the Department of Public Works, French Consul General Maguet, Portuguese Consul General Teixeira, Chairman Shen Siliang of the Municipal Sports Association, and Pan Sanxing, vice chairman of the congress, all attended. The atmosphere was enthusiastic. First, Secretary-General Zhao delivered a speech on behalf of Mayor Chen, and then the competition began. The Japanese team, relying on its talent and evenness, won two singles and one doubles match. The French team was completely defeated with a score of 0 to 3 and was tragically eliminated. Today, starting at 2:30 PM at the same venue, the Chinese team will meet the Portuguese team. The results of yesterday are as follows:</p>

<p>Maba 6-4 6-3 Avig (France)</p>
<p>Japan vs. France</p>
<p>In the second singles match, Japan's Kanda Michitomo faced France's Curentzoff. Kanda was steady and stable, while Curentzoff was brave but lacked strategy. His forehand was strong, his backhand was weak, his serve was sharp, and he changed his strategy from time to time. Curentzoff took a 2-1 lead, but Kanda won three consecutive games, coming from behind to win the first set 6-3. In the second set, Kanda took advantage of his momentum and won the first three games. Curentzoff made miraculous achievements and won six consecutive games, tying the score at one set each. In the third set, Curentzoff was not in the mood to fight and lost a set. In the doubles match, Japan's Yamagishi Seiichi and Fukushi Saburo faced France's Jordan and Brenes. Yamagishi was agile and Fukushi was brave. Although Jordan was too impulsive, he and Brenes made many mistakes and committed suicide. The two sides fought fiercely and excitingly. After a fierce battle, the Japanese team won two consecutive sets with a score of 7-5 and 8-6. In the final first singles match, Japan's Maba Shigeru faced France's Avig. Maba had the demeanor of a general. After Avig won the first game, he won five consecutive games. Avig tried to win back three games, but Maba won the first set 6-4. In the second set, Avig quickly won three games, showing a sign of revival, but from then on he declined and lost five consecutive games, losing again with a score of 3-6.</p>

<h3 id="e47">The Evolution of Food Countermeasures <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The Allied nation of Japan's Great Political Association has decided on a comprehensive outline of food countermeasures. For the implementation of China's food problem, it will focus on guidance and assistance in agricultural technology. Therefore, in its consideration of the countermeasures, there is the following section: "In the Central China region, we will cooperate with Japan's agricultural technology to seek improvement in agricultural production." Originally, Central China was a fertile land in the country, and there was no problem with natural products. However, to increase the suitability of agricultural products in both quality and scenery, it is necessary to improve China's agricultural technology. Therefore, we advocate that the training of "backbone farmers" should focus on their interest in improving cultivation methods and their knowledge of increasing agricultural quality. It is hoped that the Allied nation of Japan can provide agricultural technical cooperation with its superior experience, which is considered to be a rare opportunity.</p>
<p>The above is a consideration of the food problem from a distant and broad perspective. Secondly, there is the close point of the food problem, which is the current food control mechanism. Its recent development is the decision of the candidates for the preparatory committee of the grain procurement industry association and the announcement of the outline. Whether the food control is successful or not, as Minister Gu of the Ministry of Food said, "depends on the activities of its lower-level institutions, that is, local buyers." In addition, there is the full support and cooperation of the military authorities. Regarding this point, we are extremely grateful for the few words in the conversation of the Chinese Expeditionary Force authorities: "For rice merchants with excellent qualities, ... if they are subjected to persecution or obstruction of their procurement and transportation, resolute measures should be taken." Such cooperation is often considered a rare opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Stock Exchange Opening Soon, Stocks Gradually Become Lively, Recent Stock Market Has Turned Around <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange will officially open on the 29th of this month. Before the stock exchange resumes operation, the trend of the stock market has attracted much attention from all parties. The reporter made a special trip to various stock companies yesterday morning to investigate the actual situation. The findings of the investigation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Stock Market Turns Around</p>
<p>Since the Chinese stock market was affected by the purchase of gauze and cloth, it has been in a state of decline for more than a month. In this month or so, the market situation has been sluggish, especially last week. However, since the beginning of this week, it has begun to show signs of recovery.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Market</p>
<p>Yesterday was Saturday, and the stock market only had half a day of trading. According to the usual practice, the stock market on Saturday is bound to be weaker than the next day. However, the stock market rose sharply yesterday, reaching its highest price after 10:30 AM. Although some people sold at high prices, causing the price to gradually fall, each stock was still squeezed higher than the previous day. Moreover, there was no shortage of buyers after the market closed, and the foundation was very stable. Therefore, it is generally predicted that the stock market will be more firm in the coming week.</p>
<p>Continued Applications</p>
<p>It is also learned that all the Chinese stocks that have been registered, the personnel told reporters that the official opening still takes time, because the second batch of brokers' quotas is still awaiting approval, and the third batch is still being reported.</p>
<p>Supervisory Committee of Stock Exchange Holds First Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>The preparations for the resumption of business of the Chinese Stock Exchange are about to be completed. For the sake of supervision, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry have specially submitted an application to establish an exchange supervisory committee. It is heard that the committee held its first regular meeting on the 25th of this month at the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance. Director Chen Wei. The chairman of the meeting, all the members were present, discussed various matters that the committee should implement after the resumption of the exchange, and all preparations were actively carried out.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Measures for Transferring Materials, Appropriately Revised <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The Business Coordination Council previously stipulated that the removal, entry or transfer of major materials must be certified by the industry association and its federation, and that if the materials are related to other industries, they should also be certified by the relevant federation. The above procedures must be prepared before the export permit can be approved. This was reported in the previous newspaper. Now it is learned that the council, in order to facilitate the application of business firms for entry, exit or transfer, has decided that, for the aforementioned certification procedures, except for materials within the scope of the industry, the original measures should still be followed. If the materials to be transported are related to other industries, after the industry association and its federation have reviewed and affixed their seals for certification, the relevant federation can be exempted from affixing their seals to save procedures. It is also learned that non-major commodity industries often only have industry associations and no federations. If the materials they operate are related to major commodities, they should also apply to the Ministry of Industry according to their categories to determine whether to join the relevant federation as members. However, if there is indeed no federation to join, or before the approval to join, if you apply for the transport of materials, you can temporarily approve the industry association to issue a single order to take care of both sides. It is heard that the above measures have been separately ordered by the council to all its subordinate federations, associations, and evaluation affairs groups to investigate and handle them.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Silver and Money Industry Cooperative, Store Opens Today <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silver and Money Industry Consumer Cooperative is the only consumer cooperative with the most complete organization in the silver and money industry. It has more than 3,000 members, with Zhu Boquan as the chairman and Pan Yangyao as the vice chairman. Recently, due to the small number of original sites at No. 622 Cishu Building on Nanjing Road, it has now moved to the store at No. 420 Aiwenyi Road to handle office matters. It is learned that the cooperative will officially open on September 26 (Sunday) at 9:00 AM and will not hold any ceremonies. It will only sell commemorative special-priced goods and entertain all members.</p>
<p>Materials Transferred to South and North China, Quotations Must Match Shanghai Prices, Business Coordination Council Stipulates Two Measures</p>
<p>The Business Coordination Council believes that in the past, the unit prices of goods reported by various merchants for materials transferred to various parts of South and North China often differed greatly from the market prices in Shanghai, which caused many difficulties in handling the approval of the transfer. It is now heard that the council has specifically decided that, in the future, if the quotations for materials transferred to South and North China are too different and must be corrected, the following two measures will be implemented: For those with exchange relations, the total credit amount will not be changed, and the quantity of materials transferred will be appropriately reduced according to the current price. For those without exchange relations, the price amount will be changed and filled in according to the current price, and the quantity of materials transferred will not be reduced. However, whether there is an exchange relationship should be clearly stated in the transfer permit for separate handling.</p>
<p>Chinese Stock Trend</p>
<p>Yesterday, under the lead of Wing On Textile stocks, Chinese stocks continued to advance to their peaks. Major investors have already settled down, and sporadic investors have also started to follow the trend and compete to buy. There are also new investors who have shifted their attention to participate. Although there was a partial pullback on Saturday, there was still a feeling of more monks than porridge. The rise of public utilities and matches and other industrial stocks intensified, and finally all the stocks of various industries rose sharply in unison. The people's hearts were firm, and the transaction volume increased day by day. The dynamics of the stocks of various industries are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Textile: Wing On Textile only rose and did not fall in a single buying trend. It even rose two more levels on the day, and finally flew over the customs.

<h3 id="e51">Results of New Guinea Expedition: Metallic Resources Discovered One After Another <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The first independent effort to develop the resources of the world's only remaining dark region has come to an end. The New Guinea Civil Administration mobilized the elite of the Japanese academic world and reorganized the "Resource Survey Academic Expedition Team." Since arriving in the local area, it has been several months, traversing the dense forests that have not yet been developed, entering the miasma-ridden areas, and the mysterious realm of continuous barbarian rain, enduring indescribable hardships, and obtaining results that are the envy of the world. Now the first survey has come to an end.</p>
<p>The Truth of the Black World</p>
<p>This expedition is to carry out resource surveys on the front line of defeating Britain and the United States, so it has epoch-making significance in the history of world exploration. The team members worked tirelessly with the determination to die, overcoming all problems in front of them. As a result, the dark area that was abandoned after the previous surveys failed to discover any resources has not only discovered many necessary and important resources one after another, but also the blank parts of the mysterious realm remaining on the world map, which were previously regarded as the "dark boundary of the world," are now revealed. That is to say, in academic terms, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands have also been defeated. Their previous surveys have now discovered many errors and incompleteness. Japan is playing the paean of scientific victory. The many mineral, animal, and plant specimens collected this time are far superior to those of the Netherlands and the United States. They are now starting to organize and will publish a "research report" together with photos, which will slander the excellence of "East Asian science" to the whole world.</p>
<p>Trekking Through Mountains and Rivers, Not Afraid of Hardship</p>
<p>In the past, New Guinea had the Dutch East Indies Academic Association, the Dutch Army Expedition Team, and the American Atyballte and other expedition teams, which conducted large-scale explorations several times. Their survey methods either used airplanes to fly, or were full of a survey atmosphere of trekking through mountains and rivers like a ballroom at the base. The New Guinea Civil Administration's survey team, such as the Geology, Mineral, Animal, Plant, Agriculture, Forestry, and Human Resources teams, endured all kinds of hardships and lack and conducted a real survey.</p>
<p>Such as precious academic specimens such as minerals, rocks, animals, and plants, have been painstakingly collected from all parts of West Guinea, with as many as tens of thousands of species. This exceeds the thousands of points collected by Atyballte. Such as geological maps, etc., in addition to the initial burials, many errors were found in the geological maps used in the Dutch survey and were revised.</p>
<p>Also, the Dutch report said that there were few igneous rock areas in New Guinea, so the metallic resources were very poor. This statement has been basically overturned, and metallic resources have been discovered one after another. Such as coal, coal of excellent quality has been discovered in many places that were not discovered by the Dutch survey team. Petroleum is commonly thought to be contained in sandstone, but in this area, petroleum can also be found in coral reefs. The Dutch survey, although it covered a very wide range, did not know this. Moreover, "fossils with organic matter," which are closely related to petroleum, have also been discovered in various parts of West New Guinea, suggesting that there are abundant oil fields in the area, so it is of great significance.</p>
<p>The Geology is Coral Reef</p>
<p>At the same time, the geological structure of New Guinea has also become clear, which is also a gain for the academic community. The entire territory of New Guinea is grown from coral. During the Tertiary period about 200,000 years ago, things in the 6,000-meter seabed became 5,000-meter-high mountains above sea level. Even on the top of Mount Carstensz in the central mountain range, which is covered with snow, there is still residual clay from the seabed at that time. Therefore, in New Guinea, there are coral reefs of all ages from the earliest ancient times to the present since the earth grew. It can be regarded as a natural museum of coral reefs. The study of tropical geology and tropical underground resources cannot exclude the study of coral reefs. This has cast a light on the future of Southern Science. It is truly a great gain.</p>
<p>Water and Wood are Inexhaustible</p>
<p>Due to the rich water flow, the hydropower resources can provide more electricity than even Japan itself. From the primeval forests that have never been hacked by axes, we know that there are inexhaustible and inexhaustible usable wood and agricultural land for irrigated farms is also abundant. Moreover, unlike other tropics, rice, ginger, potatoes, sorghum, beets, yams, eggplants, etc., are all available. This can be proved by the survey of the agricultural team.</p>
<p>Also, due to the survey of the human resources team, the old image of New Guinea as the lair of savages has now been completely overturned. The physical strength and intelligence of the aborigines are unexpectedly outstanding, and the old habits of cannibalism and headhunting will no longer reappear. The culture is also quite advanced, and they are excellent human resources for the construction of East Asia. (Extracted from the Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi of September 12)</p>

<h3 id="e52">Reforming the University Salary System <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiyang</p>
<p>The university is the highest institution of learning in a country, and university professors are cultural mentors. How sacred and important is the mission they bear, and how lofty should their status be in society. This is a truth known to everyone. Even rural women and peddlers and coolies, although they do not understand the mission of university professors, they always stand in awe and regard them as saints. Who knows that generations have declined, and the meager salaries of university professors today have made them hoarse and exhausted all month and all day long for the sake of life, lecturing on academic theories.</p>
<p>A person's energy is ultimately limited: if they are so busy, how can they concentrate on lecturing, and how can they refine their knowledge outside of teaching and research her, to use what they have learned to contribute to the social group. This is nothing less than a major loss for society and mankind. The reason for this is that the school authorities attach importance to the concept of profit, and the salary system follows the established rules, without thinking of improving it to suit the reality of today's society under high prices. Here are some suggestions for reform within the scope of my humble opinion.</p>
<p>Today, each university completely calculates salaries based on clock hours, and the regulations for salaries are very meager. I think that on the one hand, of course, clock hours should be the standard, and on the other hand, extra treatment should be given based on the number of students who recognize the course. For example, if a course has 80 students listening, each student's tuition fee is 800 yuan, and the miscellaneous fee is 200 yuan. If the tuition fee of 800 yuan is averaged based on the standard of electing 18 credits (according to the standard issued by the department), then each credit is about 44 yuan. If the course has three credits, it totals 132 yuan. Multiply this by the 80 people mentioned above to get 10,560 yuan. Then divide this total number into two halves, each half being 5,280 yuan. Give one half to the professor and the other half to the school as salaries for staff and servants. In other words, the clock hours (ie, credits) are used as the standard for calculation, and the salary is abolished by clock hours and calculated on the basis of six months per semester.</p>
<p>This semester, the general university pays 40 yuan per clock hour. According to the above calculation, each clock hour is 73 yuan and 3 cents strong. The increase in treatment can be seen.</p>
<p>However, according to the above salary system, some problems still arise. Those that have to be stated are:</p>
<p>Universities have common required courses, such as foreign languages and Chinese in the first grade, etc., and the number of people must be large. The number of required courses in each department is second, and elective courses are even second. (This is generally speaking) Isn't there an uneven appearance, which affects the teaching salary. I think that for those with more than 40 students listening, the above method should be used for calculation. For those with less than 40 students, the school and the professor cannot divide equally, the professor gets two-thirds, and the school gets one-third. For subjects with too many people, extra grants should be given from the tuition fee interest items, the school surplus items, and the school fund items. It is necessary to make the highest salary close.</p>
<p>According to this salary system, the school still has a considerable surplus. For example, this semester, a certain university has more than 1,000 people, and the miscellaneous fee is 200 yuan, totaling 200,000 yuan, which is enough to cover all kinds of miscellaneous expenses such as room rent, water and electricity. The tuition fee is 800 yuan, totaling 800,000 yuan. If two-thirds is used for teaching salaries, the school still has about 260,000 yuan, which is also enough to pay the salaries of the staff. This is just the constant maintenance that the school has to take care of.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to the current high prices, in order to take care of the treatment of professors and staff and the school's expenses, it is only necessary to charge 1,000 yuan for tuition and miscellaneous fees, and there is no guilt in conscience.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that people from all walks of life, school authorities, and professors will contribute their valuable opinions so that university salaries can be improved.</p>

<h3 id="e53">New Scams Near the Train Station <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Puzhou</p>
<p>Yesterday evening, I had a relative surnamed Jiang, who had not been in Shanghai long. He was returning to his hometown of Changzhou on business. He had purchased daily necessities such as cigarettes, soap, and candles, worth approximately one thousand yuan. He hired a rickshaw from Daxilu to the North Railway Station. When passing through Kairui Road, the rickshaw puller claimed his shift was over and transferred Mr. Jiang to another rickshaw puller he knew. Mr. Jiang did not suspect anything and moved his goods into the other rickshaw, paid the fare, and left. This rickshaw puller pulled him to the Old Zha Gate Bridge and told Mr. Jiang: "Crossing the bridge here requires strict inspection and complicated procedures. It is best to take the New Zha Gate Bridge over the railway line, taking a shortcut to the North Railway Station, which will avoid any troubles such as weighing, inspection, and fines along the way."</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang, unaware of the deception, agreed to his suggestion and told him that he would give him a decent reward when he reached the station. After the rickshaw crossed the railway line, a burly man (the first rickshaw puller) jumped out from the weeds. With a shout as a signal, ambush soldiers appeared from all sides (the wives and children of the two rickshaw pullers). About ten people in total rained down fists and feet on Mr. Jiang. Surrounded on all sides, Mr. Jiang could not get anyone to answer his calls for help. He had no choice but to run home in tears. By the time he arrived, he was seriously injured and on the verge of death.</p>
<p>In today's world, where morals are declining and human desires are overflowing, all sorts of extortion and coercion are constantly evolving. The scheme of these rickshaw pullers colluding to rob naive villagers is particularly novel. I hope readers will pay attention and be vigilant to avoid being victimized, which would be of great benefit!</p>
<h3 id="e54">News from Charity Schools <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Shihua Middle School conducted entrance examinations for new students. After strict screening, only over two hundred were admitted. Except for the first year of junior high and the second year of senior high, which are full, there are still vacancies in other classes (both general studies and business studies), and recruitment continues. Education is completely free. Furthermore, the third year of senior high and the business studies courses are half-day, to allow students to work and study. The school is scheduled to start classes on the 10th. The registration period ends on the 5th of next month. The address is No. 142 Hartung Road, registration at the office of Yusu Middle School.</p>

<p>Lecture: The members of the I Ching Lecture Society will celebrate Confucius' birthday on September 26th (the 27th day of the eighth lunar month). On the afternoon of that day at 3:00 PM, they will respectfully invite the master of Sinology, Mr. Yang Zhongyi, to give a lecture on "The I Ching and Life." Afterwards, every Friday from 7:30 PM to 9:00 PM, there will be lectures on the I Ching. The address is the Hudong Commune, 4th floor, Shishibao Building, No. 514 Simalu Road.</p>
<p>Savior of the Poor and Sick: The Foguang Sanatorium at No. 123 Masnan Road was jointly founded by Buddhist lay practitioners with the aim of providing compassionate service. Recently, a skilled Sheng physician has been hired as the director of general affairs. In addition to providing daily medical consultations and medicine, they also consider the needs of those who are sick and impoverished and have no one to care for them. Those who can find a wealthy person to recommend them can be admitted to the hospital, where they will receive full responsibility for treatment, medication, and care, free of charge. However, it is said that the hospital's funds are insufficient, and they hope that all sectors of society will generously donate. (Donations can be collected on behalf of the hospital through this newspaper's column.)</p>
