<h3>再論全面和平</h3>
<p>昨天中論「中日問盟與全面和平」，我們的結論：　中日同盟條約的目的，在於進一步協力完成大東亞戰爭的勝利與戰後的建設。　促成全面和平的實現，和平區內應以修明政治，改善民生的事實，爭取重　統治下的同胞，如舍此而以談判方法與重　謀和平，則是捨本逐未之舉。我們　詳細地　了汪主席的訓詞，深覺意有禾　，再加引申如次：</p>
<p>中日之間的全面和平，就目前的情勢以觀，確然有絕對的必要。在國民收府立塲，旣與盟邦日木團協力，向擊敗英美的共同目標邁，自當使用最高度能力貨獻一切，決計不能任令重慶政權存在而分散力量，甚且相消力量。問時，國家當然是監個一體的無論在道義上或實任上以言，也決計不能任令一之內，形成分裂之局，甚且背遺而馳。我們並不武斷的說，無論在平區內或是重慶統治區內，人民對於國家的愛護心理定一致的，每個人人對於過去的旦本確有不能解之處，直到大東亞戰爭勃發國民政府對英美宜戰日本實華新政策以後本處實表示重中國獨立自由的誠意，以迄今女同盟條約的簽訂盟邦日本不但悉廢過去所予中國的小等條約，抑助廢除英所予中國的不平等條約，使中國完全恢復自由平等的地位，這一事實，以使中國人民對於今後的日本，和認識，絕對信任所以，今次中日同盟條約的訂，在論上，中國人民已無誤解日原因存在，善提携互惠平等的基石，應從今開始奠立而漸次發揚。</p>
<p>然而，在理論上即巳如此，事實上如何可以取得致呢？換句話說，如何可以實現全面和平以中國全部力量協助盟邦共同完成勝利呢們首先必須把握中日同盟條約的神與意義，使和平區內人民心理澈底瞭解，心悅誠服同乃可引致重慶統治下人民心理趨一致，上樣，全面和平就水到渠成，而且基村永固了。</p>
<p>如汪主席所言：「中國在大東亞戰爭中處在後方地位固然中國不忘記，要把精鋭隊送上前，稍分友將士的勞苦，可是確立治安，增加生產，便是後方當務之急我們就以確立治安與增加生產點而言，和平區內比較重慶政統治地區，在政治經濟兩方面的設施，務必到超過而良的事實，如物價比較低廉，生產比較增加，交比較便利治安比較穩定，民意比較能溝通，一切的地切，比較合理。簡單言之，政治比較淸明，民生比較安定。這樣的事實表現我們可以斷重統治區的人民心理必然致歸向，必然和平，必然結統那個時候，慶政踏上了無民眔的沒落途，雖欲苟延而不可得況且目前的重政，原英美的代理抓住人民心理的力量很脆弱呢</p>
<p>因此，我們決主張，全而和平如何現的焦點，完全在於國民政府能否爭取民心？而爭取心，完全在於能否修明政治與安定民生，而且切切實實的做到</p>
<h3>互惠平等為原則　協力建設大東亞　重光外相談中日盟約精神</h3>

<p>蓋自事變以來於次下之御詔勅中，恒明示帝國之根本國是，在以中日兩國之提携協力，以確保來亞之安定爲期舉共共樂之實，速除一切以確立東亞和平，於此拜察，實深恐。</p>
<p>我等皇將兵，尤其在大陸地拜受之派遣將兵於深思高這之餘，更應承韶必意效。</p>

<h3>日本增強生產力量</h3>
<p>航空戰力的增强</p>
<p>一方面所羅門，新幾內亞的航空決戰旣日益劇烈，另一方面，敵機的空鹿千島羣島及駐淪笑機的森動，亦不許輕視。這其間日本陸海軍航空部隊雖時常對以量自誇的敵軍反攻痛加打擊，但為了在此航空決戰中收得完全的勝利計，並為完遂大東亞戰爭以奠定建設大東亞共榮　的基石計，「國內態勢强化卞策一中的「舉全國總力以圖急速增强軍需生產，尤其是迅速擴充航空戰力」，責在是不可或缺的。</p>
<p>正如大家所知道，航空戰力是由飛機的質，景和搭乘員三者的速乘積來決定的。就航空機而言，由於陸海軍的指　及航空工業關係者的努力與研究，已陣績將優秀的新鋭機送往決戰的天空。據過去甘本陸軍當局的發表，「鐘馗」，「吞龍」，「新司偵」等型飛機，其性能的優越卓特，達在敵方最新說機之上。至於搭乘員、臼軍航空部隊勇士紫質的擾秀，業已舉世公認：關於搭乘員的數量，因有大批事生志願加入陣海軍航空部隊，預料也是毫無問題的。因此·餘下來的間題即在如何充實飛機的數量。不問飛機的性能如何卓越，搭乘員的賀量如何完美充足，倘若飛機的架數不多，則在還種不利的立塲上，欲保綜合航空戰力的優勢，無疑是很困難的事。</p>
<p>所以，飛機之劃期的加速增產乃成緊急的課題，要求將一億國民的總力集結於飛機增產·實行全力集法一點的超重點生產。而且，航空工業是最綜合的工業部門，乃是最能表明一國物賀戰力之動向的指標。自從中國事變前後以來，日本的重要工業已急速擴充，尤其是航空工業的膨　和發展，更為可觀。但是，欲與　稱本年度軍用機生產目標十二萬五千架，而在過去七月內已有月產七千架成績的美國生產相拮抗·確立絕對不敗的生產體制，實非易事。然而這又是非排萬難使之實現不司的事。敵方如有飛機百架，我方亦須擁有飛機百架，他們若有千架，我們也應有千架，祗有如此確實而退速的補充前綫，始可完全粉　敵軍反攻的企圖。</p>
<p>南方戰綫某某參謀　稱：「縱有良機，茍無飛機則又奈若何！」這句話該如何打動後方面民之心呢？努力實行以飛機為中心的超電點生產，打開航空工業的生產狹路，確立大量生產方式，實屬當前急務。內閣廠問藤原氏之調查航空工業狀况，其用意在此。</p>
<p>飛機生產的諧調</p>
<p>飛機的大量增產，僅由確立所謂大量生產方式始有可能。航空工業卽爲最典型的綜合工業，則依據這種本質，自必需要稱種前提要件，例如關於原料資材·勞力·動力等各種生產要素的分配·結合·關於企業系列。生產工程以及定造制度等生產行政方面的調整，在在須有強力的綜合對策。航空工業的生產系列，可大別為三種，即：　機體。引擎·零伴等縱的系列與橫的系列；　鋼鐵。石炭·鋁。炭精電極。各種非鐵金屬及化學製品等等原料方面的系列；以　工業機械，工具等機械的生產系列是。航空工業的綜合生產方可受其中最弱部門生產力的限制。尤其再採用節拍昨夜（TactSystem）·川流作業（CurrenttSysem日）等大量生產方式時·以飛機胴體零件的製作及裝配爲本流·以要。脚等分別製作的零件之製迭和裝置為支流，製造程序必須川流不息，如有一個零件發生毛病，即可破理川流作業全部工程的諧調。倘若想到小型戰門機的零件有五萬個，超重紅茶機的零件有十萬個，則航空工業的生產管理與工程管理是如何重要而困難，便不雖察知了。</p>
<p>原料的確保</p>
<p>大量生產方式的第一前提卽為確保原料資材。為完遂飛機的緊急大量增產機體所需的合金及特殊鋼固不必論，即各稱測計儀。搭載兵器·有機玻璃·合成橡膠。防音材料·鋼材。各種非鐵屬·稀有金屬·非金屬材料等範圍頗廣的原料資材·也必須都能適時圓滑分配。隨以航空工業為中心的超重點生產之推進，物資動員的分配計劃，亦有再加檢討的必要，尤其是輕金屬及特殊鋼之劃期的增產，更為緊念的課題。</p>
<p>輕金屬，特別是鋁的生產，最近質量方面皆有劃期上界之勢，例如昭和電氣工廠或甘本輕金屬廠的出品，品質均極優良（九九·五％），能夠符合製造合金之需。最近電工法（不熔燒法）的技術公諸於世，對於提高技術和節約苛性曹達，燃料，動力等實多貢獻。然在目前這樣的戰局下。共原料如全賴南方的鐵礬土，實在不妥，所以應迅即在日本內地及亞洲大陸探尋明礬石，福礬土，岩手粘土，礬土頁岩等製鋁資源，儘速加以開發。又在今日。製鋁過程中，約有二〇％是和　渒一　拋棄的，鹿該將這些有用成份完　收囘，使之化成戰力，這點也是無須多說的。再則，加　成產那些被稱爲「鋁生產之狹路」提高合金生產技術，使的炭精和水晶石，以及含鋁九九·三％·皆極</p>
<p>為合金原料之一的鎂，其重要性亦日益增加·關於此項物質·雖司活用滿州，朝鮮的氧化　　，但同時利用三　板，亦在認眞　　中屬板，亦在認眞攷究中，且有一部分業已實際應用了。</p>
<p>他方面，用以製過汽缸，曲軸，運接　　的特殊　之增函，目前也正在努十開發其原料資源（如鈷，鎳等等）。但和原料的增加生產量及增加配給量並行，在航空工業中如果也和其他重工業一樣，設定戰時規格一定的限界其性質上有一定的限界），盡量節省使用的原料，那宋，也不是沒有充實原料的餘的。（吉：　自同盟四十號）</p>

<p>雷擊準備</p>
<p>「發見敵大船屬。○○　洋面，○○○　，○○　。」九月二十一日○時○分·我方的衆敵機從○○直接電吿某基地，飛行隊一接到電話。知道預期的事終於來了、立刻下作　的命令道：「請貴　速　撲滅敵船團！」在　　的室內·司令官沈著地發令：「雷擊準備！」魚　班長馬上運金。其地突然為悲壯的空氣所籠罩。「擊隊整列！」司令官再下命令。在空　的飛行塲上·司令官對不期再見的部下、　切訓話、最後大緊喊道：「敬祝各位成功！</p>
<p>機聲隆隆，一架跟着一架，依次離陸。地上的送行者不住地　　帽子、友機中也有描　日章旗相答的。當時記者也站在送打者之驅中、感助萬分、祗是茫然不停地揮動着手中的帽子。</p>
<p>在基地的上空，魚　機和戰門機會齊、組成戰　　　的編隊，一路突　，殺到預定地點。沒有數船的影踪！「曖！」心中想着；一邊沿橫側的積亂擊，向左轉折前行分作三列　隊。</p>
<p>敵艦狼狽</p>
<p>敵方以未留意到我們的襲擊吧，中央是○艘運輸船，剛側護衛着○艘巡洋艦和○艘驅逐艦，正在忽忽前行。可是我們的　隊巳追上他們了、第一號機發出全體突擊的信號，我們卽刻從○千公尺陡降。敵方以季直到這一分鐘才發覺我們，各艦船亂紛紛地向左有轉舵，着機子眞是狠狽不堪、這樣一陣亂。反將　舷對著我們、這當然是我們求之不得的</p>
<p>不過他們雖然狠狽。却也立時向天空展開猛烈的彈幕，甚至於巡洋艦的各門主砲也一齊隆隆吐火。激擊編隊的高角砲和高角機關槍槍聲，更密如連珠。洋上瞬卽會彈幕所蔽盡，天日爲之無光；海面則水柱如林，波濤洶湧。然而暫機隊的隊形一點未曾混亂，勇猛突擊那些巡洋艦和大型驅逐艦。機中的駕駛員、偵察員，電們員以及其他人員的眼睛完全都集注在敵艦的舷腹上，彈幕是早巳不在眼中了，</p>
<p>敵艦主砲所放的彈丸、在雷擊機隊前方○十公尺處掀起了一股大水柱、○號機剛巧突入其中、全機彷彿皆被海水淋　、一瞬問衝到了敵艦附近、一顆魚　便箭也似地射了出去。「啊哈　」吐了一口氣，回頭一看、一架「洛克海特」敵機正　掠而過。這時，先頭那架友機已受主砲的直接命中；化成一朵火花。在它下面的海上，則是一條引向敵艦舷腹的自銀色的直綫；原來　是它馴才放射的那顆魚曾前進的痕跡。</p>
<p>空戰展開</p>
<p>敵軍戰鬥機正打算從側面襲擊一號機，可是我方戰鬥機馬上　　一般敏捷他追了過去。機羣向右旋迴那時，敵艦側方湧起了四股水柱，然而我們連拍手歡呼的功夫也沒有。敵機巳從我方戰鬥機的間隙中偷越過來，開始向我們桃戰了。各機的機關槍當即拍拍吐出一片烈火。戰鬥機和戰鬥機的血戰也在繼續中。空戰的展開，距離海面都不過○十公尺。</p>
<p>○發機和○號機的獎根吐着紅紅的火焰，一瞬間它們巳突入敵船團的正中、壯烈自炸了。於是，那邊的火柱和水柱冲天而起。</p>
<p>空戰○，分敵機巳被打下○○架，其餘的敵機也　無鬥志，紛紛退去。海面上，　餘的敵船關分頭鼠　。</p>
<p>報吿捷音</p>
<p>基地方面收到全軍突擊」的無線電報時、是在○○時○○分。當時。大家都會着機笑、「幹啦」！彼此交　着目光、可是，自此以後、無綫電訓是中絕了、一直沈默了○小時。看看已是應該歸這的時間。「守望者注意○方天空哪！」指揮所中的人都疑聯眺望着天空。聽到了，微微的機聲。不久，一架飛機出現了。「○○號，」高柱上的守望兵喊道。是（）小隊的○號機一。旋即平安着陸。機械士等速步跑上前去檢點機體，一共中强七十五發，但搭乘員祇有一名受到　過傷。於是大頸再望着天空。又是一架回來了。它的左萬近中央部份，有很大的燃　跡。矚目掛很，原來它的池箱起了火，好容易將火換滅。才能安然飛回。機體上七　八穿，被彈無數。</p>
<p>平常。實戰鵝　本　全體飛機到　後再行、這一回却是例外，每飛回一架飛機便作一次報吿。「我進攻一號左端的巡洋艦。」「我突擊在一　機右端的。」每飛回一架，戰集便擴大一點。最後，　索敵機和其他飛機的報告也來了，戰果是被確定了。敵軍主力全部覆滅。眞是光槃的戰　！但是。司一令官以下的募地長官們，却一雙耳朶聽着詩利報吿，一雙耳朵留神　天　的　聲，等待尚未　　的部下。一有機聲，馬上就間守望兵道：「是什麽？」可是，這　都是另外的飛　的聲音。一直等到燃料所許的時間以後。那尙未飛返的十六架飛機，依然音　全無。這　夜深，還有心不死的人們在飛行塲上等待養，他們穿着白衣的　　，時時在黑暗中閃動。一歸來呵，趕上士們！」</p>

<p>我們所乘的潛水艦○○號，縱橫馳驅於南大平洋及澳洲的敵方海城巳有數月、在各地不斷被敵人的哨戒艦，驅逐艦　潛艇的壓迫、七月二十日，在　克里斯特巴爾南方海城張路配有四引炸機　案立台推特二　B機的美國甲級巡洋艦一、驅逐艦三的敵艦隊，擊沉　金山型一艘，那時所羅門四周的海面。B二四型機連日在天空偵察，敵方的對潛水艦警戒，相當嚴重。我們已經知消最近敵卞艦隊的計劃及其　動情，而覺悟隨時有和有力的敵艦隊快戰的機會，</p>
<p>全體準備</p>
<p>七月二十日—是日平靜無事，灼熱的太陽，正在開始落下水平綫，把天空映得半片通紅，海面染成血色。老練的　音手T兵曹，那時忽聽得了一種極經的集團論軸行進聲。我和S中　K中尉少尉等在作戰室。突然從傳聲管中　到T兵曹招呼司令塔的</p>
<p>「司令塔！方位角○○廣。　到有似戰艦和驅逐艦的破水前進聲！」</p>
<p>數艦隊那時　在水平綫的那一面，從所羅門方面南下中。</p>
<p>傳聲　中、聽到艦　的發金聲，一「全體準備」的鈴聲大鳴，士官，下士官，兵士們各就自己的位置我跑到士官寢室中去拿了艦內帽，及雜記簿，鋼筆等囘來，發令所的中央，前任將校在注親着羅針　及時犧　在往機。兵士們也準備好一切，祗待金下。</p>
<p>不久，司令塔上報告：「敵人看見了」。T兵要也跟着在據聲管前，艦內全體攝送說。「敵人看見了」。</p>
<p>兵士們汗流浹背，遭內殺氣，端正交綏，　長的命金下來了：「擊　魚　戰，」因爲訓練有衆，所以鎭定　但。旣不　審，也不慌騷嗚年靑的　信長一面　　笑着。一　裳司金塔上下來，有人聞，「敵人有多少？」　漢：「　在看見桅杆了，合計　雙。三只是驅逐艦，最常中的一只似乎是戰艦，詳細還不十分淸楚。」「　機呢？」「有　架　二一四的詩衛　。　沒有看見我們　！</p>
<p>「準　戰鬥，」艦長的聲音，依然基爲鎭定。雖在幾分犧之後。就要單騎突入敵艦隊決戰，出上自艦長，下至士兵　沈着堅毅，往機而動。不久，彼我的距離祇有○○米了，傳令的聲音說：「艦內安能勿　聲，」艦內　時寂靜無聲。明助的在光燈中。充滿着濛濛的水蒸氣，大家的臉上背上，都倘着汗，屏息瞪眼而立着。那種緊張的情形，實難的形容。發金地方時艦上秒針息　息　的聲音，清晰可聞。</p>
<p>發現敵艦</p>
<p>一來了！艦長低低的聲音、從　聲管中傳出來。敵艦隊號浪而來的戀　巨姿，出現於艦前。前爾變立着二塲煙囪那是美甲級巡洋艦舊金山　的帶徵。敵方的保衛機似乎是海面上看，到一點什麽，本來一直　在那巡洋艦的上面，此時突然飛到我們的頭上，降下高慶。來囘盤旋。同時，敵方的前衛頭逐艦。佈成半月形。改變航針，甲級巡洋艦跟在左右的驅逐艦後面，其婚體巳開始完全顯現在我們的面前了。</p>
<p>和甲級巡洋艦的距離○○米，和驅逐艦的距　祇有○○米隨怎樣改變航路。總雖免我們的　盤了。請到海底去吧！「放出魚雷。　攻羣！」</p>
<p>是照例用淡淡的聲　開發合，</p>
<p>一　！知道！」是掌水　長的緊張的離音。</p>
<p>「射程！」艦長堅決的命合聲。</p>
<p>的一聲，如大風　過般的發　音漸漸離聞兵艦。他身像箭一般申　快的　力開始無音的運動。全體組員的神輕注神善魚雷的　跡。兵十們的報上都流着汗，瞪著激動的眼睛，耳中可以聽到脈息　動的聲音，將校們注親　裱上的秒針。我們大家也那一心　着懷中掛表的一秒，二秒。三秒，這眞是最緊張的一瞬間。一個兵士合十而拜，可是現在沒有人都笑他了…突然，共！共！　！　！命中的爆發聲，轟然大作，連我們艦身也受到　動而搖蕩了。</p>
<p>擊中敵艦</p>
<p>「中了！」兵士們的臉上，不由得都流露出欣喜的表情。　手握着拳，興高采烈地省跟起來。</p>
<p>「角雷。校命中甲級巡洋嬌，機械室也命中了。輪機旋轉聲停止了，祇聽見驅逐　的　機旋　聲。」</p>
<p>這　聽音室飛過來的報吿。　　　　！猛烈的大爆炸聲接踵而發。聽音手從傳聲管中報吿說：「現在遭爆炸　是甲級巡　娛所戰火藥因命中魚　而轟炸的聲音。」命中後　有三十秒，敵甲級巡洋艦的火　庫因命中魚雷而爆炸了。我們的聽音　，可以淸楚地聽得舊金山　伴着這最後的爆炸聲而沉室　庇。（古賀海軍報道班員）（翔：譯自十月二十日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>愛的飄逝</h3>
<p>— 亦</p>
<p>『小李在戀愛了。」在同　中間，每個人這麼　　，我是舍　一點輕微的揶　與嫉　的成份的。</p>
<p>在公司　，小李是最年輕的一個。他誠爲，　願，沉默而又嚴肅，不抽烟，不　麻將，自天動　地工作。晚上還在補習學校裹　，</p>
<p>然而近來，他的行動　然　點　　，維日吹着口哨，話也多了，還愛好笑，愛好修飾；每天剛到下寫字間的時候，他就急匆匆地定了，要直到深夜，才囘到宿舍。問問他，他祗笑笑，沒有確切的問答。然而這異樣，終於因　　老張在路上過　他挾着一個女人親密華在散步而獲得了解答。</p>
<p>於是喧　在同事的口頭是小李戀愛的事。</p>
<p>是的，小李是在戀愛了。</p>
<p>他的「愛人」是一個在長睫，下閃着一對　寳石般發布　子，一張貓而型的圓臉的姑娘。人家說，圓臉的姑娘是多情的；可不是。那一張會說話的小嘴角，老是潔着靑查的笑，那銀鈴機的笑聲，是充滿　醉人的甜味的。在濃密的　蔭下，翠　的草坪上，有他們絮絮的情話；在嫩紅的柔和的燈光下，爵士樂的旋律裹，有他們翩翩的舞影；在酒香四　，　華的餐室的雅座裹，有他們輕快的笑語與夜光杯的碰　聲。公間·舞聽·電影院，酒機，咖啡座，蓬不多每天有他們的足跡。飲着「愛、的香·她欣喜而又迷茫。</p>
<p>深夜，他才懷着一　與驚而又　　的心，囘到宿舍裹。</p>
<p>「小李是幸福的」。同事們哪那麼地　美　。</p>
<p>日子在「幸福的」生</p>
<p>這「幸福」也給小李的規律的生活以　著的變動。</p>
<p>白天，歡喜說話歡喜笑，當然影響到工作的效率；而意馬心猿，對工作祇是數衍，搪　；夜問過度的疲勞，影響到精神的萎頓，於是常常遲到，有時箱値就請假了，</p>
<p>請假，遲到，工作的草　與錯誤，被經理察知了。一天是上，終於在佈告處　到了。：「…姑念往日工作到當，暫予留戰。記大過一次示儆。」的　吿。</p>
<p>「愛是偉大的。記大過一次，算得什麼」　笑聲在同事中問戰開來。</p>
<p>被經理馴誡一　後，小李的生活，稍稍　　一點了。白天恢復了工作的熱情，近一個月不到的　習校夜。也問或去上踝了。</p>
<p>然而，灰色的雲陣，　很快地遮沒了這明藍的晴空。</p>
<p>小李的生活　態又轉變了。</p>
<p>雖然遼是每天到寫字間工作，但是他的神情，恍惚而又征神：沉默　，但不是呆呆着瞧窗外的天空出神。於是他的工作效率又低落下來。</p>
<p>據那個同小李最接近的阿方傳出來的消息，小李是失戀了。那個「多情」的結鎭已　關了他；小李幾次去望　，都拒絕不見。直到在馬路上發現了她巳掛在別一個男子的　上而佯作不見小學的時　，他才瞥覺到「愛」的瀉逝。</p>
<p>「嘿，也是活該，沒右足夠的本　，也想談戀愛了。」　事們的　刺的話，像一枚針，　着他胞屬的心。</p>
<p>一個巨大的打　後，再聽聽這些都　與訕笑，他無助地說：</p>
<p>「人　是那樣無情的動物鳴？」於是他哀傷而又　　，消沉，　唐。</p>
<p>夜晚。</p>
<p>小李從酒館裹　醉囘來；拖　　　的步子，　了在冷僻的馬路上。搖晃的身子一斜，衝在一　行人的身上。他迷糊地抬起頭來，一張清　的臉，一對深邃的眼珠子，止驚訝地注視着他。</p>
<p>淸凉的夜風一吹，酒已　了大半。於是他把身子寸直了，恭敬地叫：</p>
<p>「梁先生！」</p>
<p>「唔，是李仰山吧。」孰悉的、這慈祥的聲音，果眞是中學裹敎國文的梁敎授。</p>
<p>「從那兒來？這嗎晚了」梁敎授熱切地說：「舍問就在前而，去坐一會兒吧。」</p>
<p>在明亮的燈光的照射下的斗室中，小李被跟前這個慈祥的老人的溫暖的愛撫所激動了。</p>
<p>他不禁流下淚來。</p>
<p>梁敎授輕輕地摸着仰山的頭，　撫摸一個孩子似的：「告訴我，你的不如意的事。」</p>
<p>於是他訴說了自巳不幸的遭遇。閃着淚光的眼，　　着梁教授的淸　的面孔：「愛果眞是需要金　來培雙、否則就會枯　而幻減　？」</p>
<p>「不！」梁　授鑒定地說：「別那麼相信，年靑人！用金錢來遭漑的愛並不是眞正的愛，也並不是我們所需要的。」停一停、他繼　說：</p>
<p>一起始，這就定錯了路綫。你把女子看得火神秘了。你真會相信一見傾心的故事嗎？你們的相遇是偶然的、而你竟驚爲奇着了。爲什麽你祗見到　外形的美而忽略了內在的人格的美呢？然而，應眩寬恕別人，審查自己。用物資來求得女人的歡心、用高度的官能享受，一味地化錢，玩、得是維認愛的正常方法嗎？別說別人了，你自己不也有着「愛是需要金錢的培養攸錯　心理，？這兒，先得糾正你自己！假定你們問是有過愛的，這愛也是建立在浮沙上的。多麼脆弱呢！年靑人，忘去它，算是是夜的一個夢吧。用你正當的手段，健全的心理，世界之大，在未來，會獲得你理想的愛人的。然而，你，爲了失戀而感到苦悶嗎？爲了人情的冷酷而感到頽唐嗎？這也是不對的。爲什麽不把你的興趣放在工作上面呢？人生本來是爲服務而來的。爲什麼不把你的熱情去溫暖那些冷酷的人心呢？人的本心都是善良的：而世問也是充滿著愛。年青人，從　義的愛推廣到愛，社會愛人類方面去……」</p>
<p>小李默默地　　　。激　　又流下來了。</p>

<p>然而我們不怕；我們有深的信心，堅强的意志，爲了生的目的；必須向着那艱踓的路程進取！高山擋不住我們的去路，大海阻不住我們的進行，我們爲了所負的任務—明日的光明，</p>
<p>不管水深火熱，狂風暴爾，繼　着行進！</p>
<p>進行！進行！進行！在艱難中。</p>
<p>我們巳不知行過了多少路程，經過了多少歲月，</p>
<p>常我們走得筋疲力乏，　身被莉棘刺破了血的時候；</p>
<p>雖也曾氣餒停止前進，但想到所負的偉大生之使命，終於鼓起了勇氣，挺起了胸脯，克服一切艱辛，仍向前行着。一次、二次。三次，已不如衝過多少次的雖關。在人生的大路上，巳印上了我們的脚跡，在我們的生命史上，也加多了一道道辛勞的塵痕。我們在沒有完成使命。交給後人是永遠不停止進行的。</p>
<p>行！行！行！</p>
<p>我們隱約地已聽見了自由的呼聲於是歡欣佔上了每人的心頭，知道目的地巳在不遠—微明就在前哨；</p>
<p>振作精神，加速脚步，向生之旅穩迅速馳去！</p>

<h3>普及杯圓門球開幕賽評述六隊球藝　男子西靑技術進步女子綠隊人材完全</h3>
<p>二度因而延期之普及盃　門球賽，前日（三十日）在光夏中學展開序幕。是日天高氣爽，且球賽不　門票，故球迷欣賞此新穎球賽者，不下五六千人。球塲四滬，水洩不通　盛況空前，觀乎發明人錢旭滄微笑一隅，以及主辦人夏士魁之殷勤招待，可以想像一班。該賽儀式相當隆重，首由主辦人致詞，　由主席團演說。第一塲由聞·林·二老行開球禮，女子賽由美人魚執行，雜球由沈銀水以三萬元購去，及其餘捐欵共有十一萬之數，巳分送各機關，此賽由四時正正式展開。茲略述三塲經過，並作簡評，　華影勝V隊</p>
<p>華影有少數球員，因拍戲關係，未及參加。V隊大部為工商界靑年，附隊演出，均在水平綫上、而華影以個人技術較勝始終佔先。上半時以三—○，結果以六—三告捷兩隊均採取位置攻守法。進退頗有程序，華影金家標不失老将，攻守求顧。V隊最大缺點，為攻門力薄弱，華影長力甚足，始終鎭靜，不失為一有訓練隊伍。</p>
<p>綠隊破西靑女</p>
<p>有美人魚開球之後，綠隊即取總攻勢，前鋒活躍非凡。西靑女將僅恃身體魁梧，有不堪綠隊之威脅。故上半時中一任綠隊蹂躪，以二—○綠隊佔先於上半時。下半時、綠隊稍見鬆懈·寬由三—之勝局為西靑女追成三—三形勢，卒賴嚴蔚雯底角妙中奠定勝局，以四—三歷倒西女，稱覇女圓門球界、女子圓門球，尙屬少　之球賽·球迷興　集中，為该賽最引人興趣之一幕。綜論技術，綠隊之攻，取位置攻術及兩翼底角攻門術，守　用位置及人看人並顧，頭　是道所失三球，第一球玲寳懶、第三球印蘭大意。四靑女則全賴力最充足。奔跑迅速　長。個人方面，綠隊黃叫媛攻門頗有心得。嚴蔚　元氣充沛。稍有過火之　。王維珍看人功夫，勝入一等，祝小姐頗能依地位盡守職，容淑儉，李　芝，俱無失誤之點不失老將，西靑女以林諾夫及蘇珊為最佳，其攻門姿勢頗為美麗落點亦甚佳，餘子平平，僅恃氣力而巳。觀乎綠隊之技術，人材完全，當可稱霸滬上。</p>
<p>西靑勝百樂門</p>
<p>比賽出乎意料之外，鬆弛異常，原因為百樂門健將不齊，戰局始終一面倒。西靑始終佔先，上半時六—二，結果八—四，四靑大勝。論兩隊戰術，均採人看人策略。唯四靑善利用兩翼站角攻門，浮尼克，陶勃林基之攻門，極有心得，角度奇佳，且有球着地在球門前一碼落地彈進攻法，殊為特點致使百樂門守門姚崇一籌莫展，一改其平日威風，不能救出險球·是不能不佩服西靑戰術之進步也，百樂門都本生包松圓身材高大·個人技術，　日出色·惜乎全隊臨時凑拉，不宰大敗，如能整　以臨</p>
<p>未使不能。與四靑爭一日之長短也。</p>
<p>塲後散記</p>
<p>因觀衆擁　·有幫衆攀於該塲藍球架。寬以人多之故。球架折倒、重傷一小學生。釘嵌入頭頂、血流如注。後送醫院。</p>
<p>百樂門球員包松圓與裁判吳子彬，因一言不合，幾至動武，旋經力勸即平靜。</p>
<p>某記者擬至司令台上抄名單，為某幹事拒絕，謂非有請柬不准上台該記者默為引退。然則該幹事實大矯枉過正也，（必答）</p>

<h3>Further Discussion on Comprehensive Peace</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Central Commentary, "The Sino-Japanese Alliance and Comprehensive Peace," concluded: The purpose of the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty lies in further cooperation to complete the victory of the Greater East Asia War and post-war reconstruction. To promote the realization of comprehensive peace, the peace zone should strive to win over compatriots under the rule of Chongqing by improving politics and improving people's livelihoods. If we abandon this and seek peace through negotiation with Chongqing, it would be abandoning the fundamental and pursuing the superficial. After carefully studying Chairman Wang's instruction, we deeply feel that it has a profound meaning. We further elaborate it as follows:</p>
<p>Comprehensive peace between China and Japan is, judging from the current situation, indeed absolutely necessary. From the perspective of the National Government's position, since it is cooperating with its ally Japan to move towards the common goal of defeating Britain and the United States, it should use its highest ability and dedicate everything. It is determined not to allow the existence of the Chongqing regime to disperse its strength, or even cancel out its strength. At the same time, the country is of course a unified whole. Whether in terms of morality or practical responsibility, it is absolutely impossible to allow a split within the country, or even to deviate and run counter to each other. We do not dogmatically say that the people, whether in the peace zone or in the Chongqing-controlled area, have the same level of patriotic feeling towards the country. Everyone has certain irresolvable problems with the past Japanese actions. It was not until the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, when the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States and Japan implemented a new policy towards China, that Japan truly showed its sincerity in respecting China's independence and freedom. Until the signing of the current alliance treaty, allied Japan not only completely abolished the unequal treaties previously imposed on China, but also helped abolish the unequal treaties imposed on China by Britain, so that China fully restored its free and equal status. This fact has allowed the Chinese people to have a new understanding of Japan in the future and to absolutely trust it. Therefore, with the signing of this Sino-Japanese alliance treaty, in theory, there is no longer any reason for the Chinese people to misunderstand Japan. The cornerstone of friendly cooperation, mutual benefit, and equality should be laid and gradually promoted from now on.</p>
<p>However, if this is the case in theory, how can we achieve consistency in practice? In other words, how can we achieve comprehensive peace and assist the allies in completing the victory with all of China's strength? We must first grasp the spirit and significance of the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty, so that the people in the peace zone can thoroughly understand it and be sincerely convinced. Only then can we lead the people under the rule of Chongqing to have a consistent mindset. In this way, comprehensive peace will come naturally and the foundation will be permanently solidified.</p>
<p>As Chairman Wang said, "Although China is in the rear in the Greater East Asia War, China does not forget to send elite troops to the front to share the hardships of our friendly soldiers. However, establishing security and increasing production are the most urgent tasks in the rear." Taking the establishment of security and the increase in production as examples, the political and economic facilities in the peace zone must exceed and be better than those in the Chongqing-controlled area. For example, prices should be relatively lower, production should be relatively higher, transportation should be relatively more convenient, security should be relatively more stable, and public opinion should be relatively more easily communicated. Everything should be more reasonable. In short, politics should be more clean and people's livelihoods should be more stable. Such a factual performance can allow us to conclude that the people in the Chongqing-controlled area will inevitably be drawn to our side, inevitably desire peace, and inevitably move towards unification. At that time, the Chongqing government will embark on a path of decline without popular support, and will not be able to survive even if it wants to prolong its existence. Moreover, the current Chongqing government, as an agent of Britain and the United States, has a very fragile grasp on the people's minds.</p>
<p>Therefore, we firmly believe that the focus of how to realize comprehensive peace lies entirely in whether the National Government can win over the hearts of the people. And winning over the hearts of the people depends entirely on whether it can improve politics and stabilize people's livelihoods, and do so practically.</p>
<h3>Mutual Benefit and Equality as Principles, Cooperatively Build Greater East Asia, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Talks About the Spirit of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) - Foreign Minister Shigemitsu stated when meeting with reporters at the Foreign Minister's official residence on the afternoon of the 10th that the conclusion of the new alliance treaty between Japan and China is a manifestation of the original state of the two countries. The content of his speech was: "There is an ancient saying in China that sincerity is the way of heaven. The conclusion of this alliance treaty is a manifestation of our original nature in everything. The conclusion of this treaty will surely resolve problems, liberate Asia, and restore East Asia." He added, "I believe that this kind of righteousness can be understood by both people and China, and that they will definitely be able to cooperate with each other." The fundamental spirit of the treaty concluded this time with China is the same as that of the treaties previously concluded with the Philippines and other countries. Therefore, the countries and peoples of East Asia should be able to live in harmony with each other based on their own complete independence, and further carry out the war against Britain and the United States by cooperating with each other in a spirit of mutual benefit and equality. I believe that this is truly the great righteousness of the world, and only in this way can the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere be completed. Therefore, we should promote this fundamental policy to the world from a diplomatic perspective in the future. From a political point of view, the world is vast. If a certain country interferes in the political affairs of other countries, or even invades and annexes its independence, this is extremely unnatural and absolutely impossible. The principle is very clear. From an economic point of view, the world is narrow. This is the source of economic wars and resource wars. This Greater East Asia War can also be said to have been caused by economic oppression by Japan. Economically, we should complement each other's strengths and weaknesses and liberate each other. This is the original state of the world. However, today Britain and the United States are trying to take the opportunity to seize the land of East Asians and violate the lives of East Asians. Therefore, the one billion people of Greater East Asia should concentrate their strength to protect their homeland and fight the Anglo-American race until righteousness prevails. This is the great righteousness of Asia and also the path that Japan should take."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) - Mr. Oya, the president of the China News Agency, stated in a speech on the day the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty was signed that the National Government's announcement last year was not merely a diplomatic gesture, but a kind of spirit. It has only been a year since Chairman Wang published the announcement, and this Sino-Japanese alliance treaty has been signed, which clearly indicates the restoration of China and the protection of East Asia to our people. The spirit expressed by Chairman Wang's diplomacy is a moral spirit. Therefore, the signing of the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty is an inevitable development of moral diplomacy. The current facts show that allied Japan took the lead in returning concessions and abolishing extraterritoriality. Now, with the signing of the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty, the spirit is like the sun in the sky, making the people in the peace zone jubilant. Those who are unfortunately mired in the so-called anti-Japanese war zone will inevitably deepen their determination to give up resistance. Therefore, the signing of this Sino-Japanese alliance treaty is also sufficient to promote the realization of comprehensive peace. Here, I deeply hope that the people of our Golden Country will cooperate wholeheartedly with allied Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War. Narrow-minded and short-sighted nationalists may think that if China is restored, why must we protect East Asia? This is the biggest mistake. We know that if East Asia is not the East Asia of East Asians, and Chinese people cannot become Chinese people of China, how can people not do their best to fight the Greater East Asia War and live and die with their allies? In addition, what I want to say is that both the Chinese and Japanese people must deeply understand the painstaking efforts of the government for the long-term plans of the two countries, and must carefully examine them. Mutual respect and love should be maintained in mutual interactions. Carelessness in daily contact between the people of both sides is enough to affect mutual misunderstandings and distortions of major policies. In our country, we must start with understanding and respecting Japan. On the side of allied Japan, we must deeply understand the feelings of the Chinese people and have a deeper sense of love than usual.</p>
<h3>Following the Correct Path, Implementing Beliefs, Striving to Complete the Mission, Speech by the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 31st (Central News Agency) - After Japan and China concluded an alliance treaty, the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China issued a special statement yesterday: "This alliance treaty between Japan and China demonstrates the eternal and unchanging path of Sino-Japanese relations, and I am sincerely moved. With the lasting peace of East Asia and the realization of the ideal of harmonious coexistence of all nations, the origin of this treaty can be regarded as a manifestation of sincerity.</p>
<p>Since the Incident, the fundamental national policy of the Empire has always been clearly stated in the imperial edicts issued by His Majesty, which is to ensure the stability of Asia through cooperation between China and Japan, to achieve the reality of shared prosperity, and to quickly eliminate all obstacles in order to establish peace in East Asia. I deeply fear this."</p>
<p>"We, the imperial generals and soldiers, especially the expeditionary soldiers stationed on the mainland, should, after deep consideration, further inherit the imperial will."</p>
<p>"I deeply believe that the purpose of this treaty is the thorough embodiment of the new policy towards China and the final result of its spirit. I will continue to adhere to the established policy and devote all my enthusiasm and efforts to ensure its thorough implementation. I hereby reiterate that this will not end until it is completed. What is important for the dispatched force is to implement and practice, which is self-evident. However, in the handling of the current situation, we must never engage in appeasement or adhere to the petty interests of the present. We must always stand from the perspective of the overall situation, follow the correct path, and implement the great principles of national policy, and be courageous and decisive in making corrections. The conduct of the dispatched troops, the guiding principles of daily life, have been described in detail in the report to the dispatched troops in China and other Chinese soldiers in the Greater East Asia War."</p>
<p>"All the soldiers and officers of the entire army, starting anew and building on the glorious history and traditions of the dispatched forces, must further strengthen discipline, lead by example, those above must be solemn and cautious, and those below must be strict and complete. The entire army should unite like a fortress, seek to further strengthen combat power, strengthen war preparations, and not recklessly hope for peace or be paralyzed. Firmly and immovably, we must strive to fulfill our duties. I deeply hope that the armies of China and Japan will recognize their inherent mission, cooperate with each other, and do their best to seek the eternal prosperity of the two countries and the realization of the ideal of Greater East Asia."</p>

<h3>Japan Enhances Production Capacity</h3>
<p>Enhancing Air Power</p>
<p>As the aerial battle in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea intensifies, the enemy's air raids on the Kuril Islands and the movement of aircraft carriers cannot be taken lightly. Although the Japanese Army and Navy Air Forces have frequently launched counterattacks against the numerically superior enemy forces, in order to achieve complete victory in this aerial battle and to complete the Greater East Asia War to lay the cornerstone for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the "Policy of Strengthening the Domestic Situation," which includes "using the total national strength to rapidly increase military production, especially the rapid expansion of air power," is indispensable.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, air power is determined by the product of the quality, quantity, and personnel of aircraft. As far as aircraft are concerned, thanks to the efforts and research of the Army and Navy and those involved in the aviation industry, excellent new aircraft have been sent to the skies of decisive battles. According to past announcements by the Army authorities, aircraft such as the "Shoki," "Ryusei," and "New Reconnaissance Aircraft" have superior performance that surpasses the enemy's latest aircraft. As for the personnel, the outstanding quality of the warriors of the Japanese Army and Navy Air Forces has been recognized worldwide. Regarding the quantity of personnel, due to the large number of students voluntarily joining the Navy Air Force, it is expected that there will be no problems. Therefore, the remaining issue is how to increase the quantity of aircraft. No matter how excellent the performance of the aircraft is, and how perfect and sufficient the number of personnel is, if the number of aircraft is small, it will undoubtedly be difficult to maintain the advantage of comprehensive air power in such an unfavorable position.</p>
<p>Therefore, the epoch-making acceleration of aircraft production has become an urgent issue, requiring the total strength of 100 million people to be concentrated on aircraft production and the implementation of super-priority production with all-out efforts. Moreover, the aviation industry is the most comprehensive industrial sector and is the most telling indicator of a country's material strength. Since before and after the China Incident, Japan's key industries have expanded rapidly, especially the expansion and development of the aviation industry. However, it is not easy to compete with the United States, which aims to produce 125,000 military aircraft this year and has already achieved a monthly production of 7,000 aircraft in the past seven months, and to establish an absolutely invincible production system. However, it is something that must be achieved despite all difficulties. If the enemy has 100 aircraft, we must also have 100 aircraft. If they have 1,000 aircraft, we must also have 1,000 aircraft. Only by reliably and rapidly replenishing the front lines can we completely crush the enemy's attempts to counterattack.</p>
<p>A certain staff officer on the Southern Front said, "Even with good opportunities, what can we do without aircraft!" How should this statement move the hearts of the people in the rear? It is an urgent task to strive to implement super-priority production centered on aircraft, to open up the narrow road of production in the aviation industry, and to establish a mass production system. The investigation of the aviation industry situation by Cabinet Councilor Fujiwara is intended for this purpose.</p>
<p>Harmony in Aircraft Production</p>
<p>Massive increases in aircraft production are only possible by establishing what is called a mass production system. Since the aviation industry is the most typical comprehensive industry, it necessarily requires various prerequisites, such as the allocation and combination of various production factors such as raw materials, labor, and power, the adjustment of production administration in terms of corporate series, production processes, and ordering systems. The production series of the aviation industry can be broadly divided into three types: vertical and horizontal series such as airframes, engines, and components; series of raw materials such as steel, coal, aluminum, carbon electrodes, various non-ferrous metals, and chemical products; and production series of machinery such as industrial machines and tools. The comprehensive production of the aviation industry is limited by the productivity of its weakest sector. Especially when adopting mass production methods such as the takt system and current system, the manufacture and assembly of aircraft fuselage parts is the main stream, and the manufacture and installation of parts manufactured separately, such as landing gear, are the tributaries. The manufacturing process must be seamless, and if one part fails, it can disrupt the harmony of the entire process of the current system. Considering that a small fighter plane has 50,000 parts and a super-heavy bomber has 100,000 parts, it is easy to understand how important and difficult the production management and engineering management of the aviation industry are.</p>
<p>Ensuring Raw Materials</p>
<p>The first prerequisite for a mass production system is to ensure raw materials and supplies. In order to complete the emergency mass production of aircraft, it is necessary to smoothly allocate alloys and special steels required for the airframe, as well as a wide range of raw materials and supplies such as various measuring instruments, mounted weapons, organic glass, synthetic rubber, soundproofing materials, steel, various non-ferrous metals, rare metals, and non-metallic materials. With the promotion of super-priority production centered on the aviation industry, it is necessary to re-examine the allocation plan of material mobilization, especially the epoch-making increase in the production of light metals and special steels, which is an urgent task.</p>
<p>The production of light metals, especially aluminum, has recently shown a trend of epoch-making improvement in terms of both quality and quantity. For example, the products of Showa Electric Industry and Japan Light Metal Factory are of extremely high quality (99.5%) and can meet the needs of alloy manufacturing. Recently, the electric arc furnace method (non-melting method) technology has been made public, which has greatly contributed to improving technology and saving caustic soda, fuel, and power. However, under the current war situation, it is inappropriate to rely entirely on bauxite from the South for raw materials. Therefore, we should quickly search for aluminum-making resources such as alum stone, bauxite, Iwate clay, and alum shale in Japan and the Asian continent and develop them as soon as possible. Furthermore, in today's aluminum production process, about 20% of the components are discarded as waste. It is needless to say that these useful components should be completely recovered and transformed into combat power. In addition, it is increasingly important to increase the production of those that are called "the bottlenecks of aluminum production" to improve alloy production technology, and to ensure that carbon electrodes and cryolite, as well as magnesium, which contains 99.3% aluminum and is one of the best alloy raw materials. Regarding this substance, although it is appropriate to utilize the oxidation resources of Manchuria and Korea, we are also seriously studying the use of Sanjo plate and a portion of it has already been practically applied.</p>
<p>On the other hand, efforts are currently underway to increase the production of special materials (such as cobalt, nickel, etc.) used to manufacture cylinders, crankshafts, and connecting rods, and to develop their raw material resources. However, in parallel with increasing the production volume and increasing the allocation of raw materials, if the aviation industry, like other heavy industries, sets a certain limit on wartime specifications (a certain limit on its nature) and saves as much as possible on the raw materials used, then there is also room to replenish the raw materials.

After President Pan Kang and Secretary Gao Xiang gave speeches, the Secretary performed the opening ceremony. During the break, a charity ball auction was held, personally presided over by Lin Kanghou. Xu Pengzong, a young boy, purchased the first ball for 50,000 yuan. The second ball was auctioned off for 35,000 yuan by Qi Qishu He. At the same time, Mrs. Xu Datong donated 30,000 yuan on the spot, and Yu Aitang donated 10,000 yuan, for a total of 125,000 yuan, demonstrating their enthusiasm for education.</p>
<p>The match began with Tung Wah launching a strong offensive. Tung Mingzhe repeatedly missed good opportunities, and Sun Jinshun's long-range shot also failed. Li Yao made a deep penetration and was about to succeed, but Ma Shan'er, an experienced veteran, proved to be extraordinary and secured the defense. At 32 minutes, Wang Xisheng was injured and left the field, replaced by Han Longgen. At this time, Tung Wah's luck suddenly improved. At 37 minutes, Jia Youliang swept the ball into the net, scoring the first goal. Less than a minute later, Han Longhai bravely attacked and scored the second goal. At the end of the first half, Tung Wah took a 2-0 lead. In the second half, Portuguese player Colaza committed a handball in the penalty area. Sun Tui, the "Iron Leg," took the penalty kick and scored again. The Portuguese team managed to pull back one goal, but then Youliang scored with a header, making it 4-1. Until the end of the match, there were no further goals. Tung Wah won a decisive victory over Portugal 4-1. Pan Sanxing presented the awards and the event concluded. Tung Wah team: Zhang Li, Ning Liao Shiming, Tan Fuzhen, Wang Xisheng, Longgen, Li Yao, Sun Shun, Chen Mingzhe. Portuguese team: Luo Chai Liao, Ma Shanfang, Xian Ka'er, Aolie Weila, Mai Mo V, Su Ruo Fuen H, Colaza.</p>

<h3>Industry Associations Awaiting Assistance with Reorganization, Demand for Raw Material Allocation Even More Urgent</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, the main and secondary industry associations in this city have been reorganizing in accordance with new government regulations, and they have been gradually completed. The number of units is estimated to be over a hundred. The reorganization of the industry associations was originally intended to allow members to promote the welfare of the industry and implement unified allocation of raw materials. However, to this day, on the one hand, there are unhealthy elements within the associations themselves, and on the other hand, the authority of various production management authorities is mixed. Their purpose is only to promote the reorganization of the associations. As for how to assist in developing their work after the reorganization, their attitude is quite cold, leading to disappointment among industry members. According to information from Shanghai Social News reporters, some knowledgeable individuals in the industry associations believe that if the associations exist in name only and do nothing, they will inevitably decline. In order to gain the firm trust and cooperation of industry members and enable the associations to truly represent the interests of industry members, there is a real need to actively reorganize and strengthen the internal organization and work. It is necessary for the various industry associations to concentrate and exert the power of economic control under the wartime system. It is reported that responsible individuals from several associations have recently been requesting assistance from relevant authorities in various aspects such as raw material acquisition and allocation, mandatory membership for stores, and price adjustments, so that their work can be carried out smoothly and the associations do not exist in name only.</p>
<h3>All Industry Transactions Must Be Carried Out According to Regulations</h3>
<p>Allocated Goods Must Be Sold Within the Specified Time</p>
<p>In order to protect people's livelihoods and revitalize industry and commerce, the various main operating authorities in this city have successively adopted various effective measures to strictly supervise industry transactions. As a result, various speculative transactions have been virtually eliminated, and the prices of goods have not increased as drastically as in the past two or three months. Households are eagerly awaiting the reduction of prices, and forward trading has been completely stopped. However, spot transactions must be carried out in accordance with the following regulations and must not be deliberately violated. Otherwise, severe penalties will be imposed. These include: (1) Spot transactions are only permitted for legitimate merchants involved in the relevant goods. (2) Transportation permits for goods are only valid when issued to legitimate merchants involved in the relevant goods. (3) Individual speculation and hoarding, and the transportation of any goods, are prohibited. (4) Various important and non-important allocated goods must be sold within the specified time in accordance with the regulations and must not be sold at higher prices or deliberately concealed, or any similar illegal acts. Otherwise, they will be regarded as illegal transactions and will be severely punished once verified.</p>
<h3>Lending of New Credit Should Be Cautious After the Completion of the Tenth Term</h3>
<p>The Shanghai industrial and commercial tenth term has passed smoothly and steadily since the various exchange houses and affiliated merchants completed the credit lending that expired at the end of the tenth term. In addition to the full repayment of some US-denominated credit loans, there are also some loans that have been extended after mutual agreement. All interest has been paid and the borrowing contract has been renegotiated. Therefore, the process has been very good. It is learned that the various exchange houses and colleagues will decide on the lending of new credit after the end of the tenth term and will handle it with special caution under the principle of tightening implementation by the Ministry of Finance, so as to ensure that the funds are used in the right way for real and productive industries.</p>
<h3>Soap and Match Retailers, Forms Have Been Printed and Distributed to Households for Purchase</h3>
<p>After the implementation of the soap and match rationing system, it is learned that the ration amount is confirmed to be one small box of matches and one bar of soap per purchase certificate. The selling price is the same as for rice flour, and will be specified in a public announcement at any time. The first batch of allocated goods will be purchased from a portion of the registered inventory for sale. Long-term allocation will be supplied by the manufacturers. The sales date is still to be officially announced, but it will be no later than the beginning of November. A total of 397 retailers have been designated, and their locations and signs have been numbered and printed. The cards have been distributed to the heads of households in the first and eighth districts, informing them to check and collect their purchases. As for the salt retailers, they have not yet been designated, so the implementation of the rationing by population will be slower than for soap and matches.</p>
<h3>Daily Necessities Particularly Popular in Shanghai Last Week</h3>
<p>The Shanghai cloth gold, deputy, and industrial and commercial cloth conditions have undergone many changes in the past week due to the persuasion of unwarranted rumors. The cloth rose and fell again, the stock market rose and fell, and the public prices fluctuated, and the transactions were very active. However, it is still a speculative behavior. Other daily necessities have gradually increased because the holders are reluctant to easily sell them, but the publicly set market prices have not changed. During the tenth term, the cash flow of the silver and money industries was flexible, and most of the industrial and commercial industries were able to repay the long-term credit loans on time. Therefore, the money root has become looser, and the money industry's discount rate has been lowered to 1.2 cents. During this cycle, although the mortgage business of various industries was good, the deposits decreased. Therefore, the current financial situation in Shanghai is becoming more normal and stable.</p>

<h3>Enemy Ships Near Finschhafen: Bravely Sunk by Japanese Air Force; Flight Petty Officer Recounts Fierce Battle</h3>
<p>1.  Three enemy cruisers, one destroyer, and one large transport ship sunk; cruisers and small transport ships each suffering two fires; another two cruisers suffered near-miss damage. Twenty-two of our planes were shot down. Unconfirmed whether eight landed safely? Landing locations were also bombed, with five planes struck and set ablaze." Wow, what golden and gratifying news to hear! When the Japanese Air Force discovered an enemy convoy heading toward Finschhafen, they took the initiative and bravely attacked, scoring hits with their torpedoes. After a fierce and earth-shattering battle, they finally achieved such results, while sixteen Japanese aircraft also made a heroic sacrifice. The following details were recounted to a reporter at a certain base by Flight Petty Officer K and Flight Petty Officer A, who personally participated in the attack. The intensity of the battle still makes the reporter's heart tremble.</p>
<p>Torpedo Attack Preparation</p>
<p>"Enemy large ships discovered. ○○ Ocean, ○○○, ○○." At ○ o'clock ○ minutes on September 21st, our reconnaissance plane directly telegraphed a certain base. Upon receiving the call, the flight squadron knew that what they had been anticipating had finally arrived. Immediately, they issued the order: "Your squadron is to swiftly engage and annihilate the enemy convoy!" In the calm office, the commanding officer calmly ordered: "Prepare for torpedo attack!" The torpedo squad leader immediately transported the bombs. The area was suddenly enveloped in a solemn atmosphere. "Attack squadron, form up!" the commanding officer further ordered. On the clear airfield, the commanding officer gave a passionate speech to his men, whom he might never see again, and finally shouted loudly: "I wish you all success!"</p>
<p>Aircraft roaring, one after another, took off in sequence. The ground crew waved their caps incessantly, and some friendly planes even signaled back with the Hinomaru flag. At that time, the reporter also stood among the send-off party, feeling deeply moved, just waving his cap aimlessly.</p>
<p>Above the base, torpedo planes and fighter planes joined together, forming a powerful battle formation, and rushed toward the designated location. No trace of the enemy fleet! "Oh!" Thinking to himself, he turned left, passing through the cumulonimbus clouds on the side, dividing into three columns.</p>
<p>Enemy Ships in Disarray</p>
<p>The enemy had probably not noticed our attack. In the center were ○ transport ships, guarded on either side by ○ cruisers and ○ destroyers, advancing carelessly. But our squadron had already caught up with them. The lead aircraft issued a signal for a full-scale attack, and we immediately dove steeply from ○ thousand meters. The enemy only realized our presence at that moment, and their ships turned left and right in confusion, their planes in utter disarray. This confusion, however, exposed their broadsides to us, which was, of course, what we were hoping for.</p>
<p>But even in their disarray, they immediately launched a fierce barrage of fire into the sky. Even the main guns of the cruisers roared together. The anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns of the attacking squadron sounded even more densely, like a string of pearls. The ocean was instantly obscured by the barrage, the sky darkened, and water columns rose like forests on the tumultuous sea. Yet the attack squadron's formation remained unbroken, bravely attacking those cruisers and large destroyers. The eyes of the pilots, observers, radio operators, and other crew members were completely focused on the enemy ships' hulls, the barrage long forgotten.</p>
<p>An enemy shell fired from a main gun created a large water column ○ ten meters in front of the torpedo squadron. Plane number ○ happened to fly directly into it, the entire plane seemingly drenched in seawater. In a moment, it rushed close to the enemy ship, and a torpedo was fired like an arrow. "Ah!" Exhaling, he looked back and saw a "Lockheed" enemy plane swooping past. At this moment, the lead friendly plane had taken a direct hit from a main gun, turning into a burst of flame. On the sea below, a silver line extended toward the enemy ship's hull; it was the trace of the torpedo it had just launched.</p>
<p>Air Combat Unfolds</p>
<p>Enemy fighters were about to attack Plane No. 1 from the side, but our fighter planes immediately chased after them with lightning speed. As the planes circled to the right, four water columns erupted on the side of the enemy ship. However, we didn't even have time to applaud. Enemy planes had slipped through the gaps in our fighter cover and began to challenge us. The machine guns of each plane immediately spat out a blaze of fire. Dogfights between the fighters continued. The air combat unfolded no more than ○ ten meters above the sea.</p>
<p>Plane ○ and Plane ○, their gun muzzles spitting red flames, instantly plunged into the very center of the enemy convoy, heroically self-detonating. There, columns of fire and water shot into the sky.</p>
<p>In about ○ minutes of aerial combat, ○○ enemy planes had been shot down. The remaining enemy planes, devoid of fighting spirit, retreated one after another. On the sea surface, the remaining enemy ships scattered in panic.</p>
<p>Reporting the Victory</p>
<p>The base received the radio message "Full-scale attack" at ○○ hours ○○ minutes. At that time, everyone smiled and exclaimed, "Let's do it!" exchanging glances. But from then on, radio communication was cut off, remaining silent for ○ hours. Seeing that it was already the expected time of return, "Watchmen, pay attention to the sky in the ○ direction!" Everyone in the command post gazed anxiously at the sky. They heard it, a faint engine sound. Soon, a plane appeared. "Number ○○," the watchman on the high tower shouted. It was Plane No. ○ from Squadron (). Immediately, it landed safely. Mechanics rushed forward to inspect the aircraft. It had sustained seventy-five hits, but only one crew member had suffered a minor injury. Then everyone looked at the sky again. Another plane returned. Its left wing, near the center, had a large burn mark. It attracted attention, as its fuel tank had caught fire. It barely managed to extinguish the fire and fly back safely. The aircraft had countless bullet holes.</p>
<p>Normally, a full report would be given after all the aircraft had returned from a combat mission. This time, however, was an exception. Each time a plane returned, a report was made. "I attacked the cruiser on the left of No. 1." "I attacked the right side of No. 1." With each returning plane, the battle situation became clearer. Finally, reports from reconnaissance planes and other aircraft arrived, and the results of the battle were confirmed. The enemy's main force had been completely annihilated. It was a truly glorious victory! But the base commanders, including the commanding officer, were listening intently to each report while simultaneously straining their ears to hear the sound of aircraft in the sky, awaiting the return of their missing men. Every time they heard the sound of an engine, they would immediately ask the watchman: "What is it?" But these were all the sounds of other aircraft. Long after the allowable time for fuel had passed, the sixteen missing aircraft remained unaccounted for. Deep into the night, people who refused to give up hope were still waiting at the airfield, their white uniforms flashing in the darkness. "Return, oh return, my brave comrades!"</p>
<p>This was a battle where the victory was great, but the sacrifices were also significant! (Four ○ ○ husband) (Translation from the October 22nd Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Last Diary of the U.S. Cruiser San Francisco</h3>
<p>Our submarine, ○○, has been cruising the enemy waters of the South Pacific and Australia for months. In various locations, we have been constantly harassed by enemy patrol ships, destroyers, and submarines. On July 20th, in the sea south of ○ Kristobal, we encountered a U.S. Class A cruiser, a "San Francisco" type, accompanied by three destroyers, escorted by four fighter planes, two patrol planes, and two B-24 aircraft. We sank one "San Francisco" type cruiser. At that time, the waters around the Solomon Islands were being constantly patrolled by B-24 aircraft, making enemy anti-submarine surveillance extremely severe. We had recently learned of the enemy fleet's plans and movements, and were prepared for an engagement with a strong enemy fleet at any time.</p>
<p>Full Preparation</p>
<p>July 20th – The day was peaceful and uneventful. The scorching sun was beginning to set below the horizon, painting half the sky red and the sea blood-red. Veteran sonar operator Petty Officer T suddenly heard a very faint sound of multiple propellers advancing. I, along with Lieutenant S and Ensign K, were in the operations room when Petty Officer T suddenly called the conning tower through the voice tube:</p>
<p>"Conning tower! Bearing ○○ degrees. I hear the sound of warships and destroyers advancing!"</p>
<p>The enemy fleet was then on the horizon, heading south from the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>Through the voice tube, we heard the captain's order, and the "All Hands Prepare" bell rang loudly. Officers, petty officers, and sailors all went to their assigned positions. I ran to the officers' quarters to retrieve my ship's cap, notebook, and pen. In the center of the command post, the executive officer was focused on the compass and the instruments. The sailors also prepared everything, awaiting orders.</p>
<p>Soon, the conning tower reported: "Enemies sighted." Petty Officer T then repeated into the voice tube for the entire ship to hear: "Enemies sighted."</p>
<p>The sailors were sweating profusely, the atmosphere inside the ship tense. We waited calmly, and the captain's order finally came: "Prepare for torpedo battle!" Because of the extensive training, we remained calm. There was no whispering or panic. Young signalman Nagato smiled. Someone coming down from the conning tower asked, "How many enemies are there?" The answer: "I can see masts, a total of ○ ships. Three are destroyers, and the largest seems to be a battleship, but the details are not yet clear." "What about aircraft?" "There are ○ patrolling B-24s. They haven't seen us!"</p>
<p>"Prepare for battle," the captain's voice remained calm. Although we were about to single-handedly penetrate the enemy fleet for a decisive battle in a few minutes, from the captain down to the sailors, everyone remained calm and resolute, moving forward. Soon, the distance between us was only ○○ meters. A voice announced: "Silence within the ship." The inside of the ship became silent. In the bright light, filled with misty water vapor, everyone's face and back were covered in sweat as we held our breath and stared. It was a truly difficult situation to describe. The ticking of the seconds on the ship's clock could be clearly heard.</p>
<p>Enemy Ships Discovered</p>
<p>"Here they come!" The captain's low voice came through the voice tube. The towering figures of the enemy fleet, riding the waves, appeared before us. The two prominent smokestacks were the hallmark of the U.S. Class A cruiser San Francisco. The enemy's escort planes seemed to have seen something on the surface of the sea. Having been circling over the cruiser, they suddenly flew over us, descending to a low altitude and circling back and forth. At the same time, the enemy's leading destroyer formed a semi-circle, changing course. The Class A cruiser followed behind the destroyers on either side, their entire formation now completely visible to us.</p>
<p>The distance to the Class A cruiser was ○○ meters, and the distance to the destroyers was only ○○ meters. No matter how we changed course, we couldn't avoid their pursuit. Let's go to the seabed! "Fire torpedoes! Attack squadron!"</p>
<p>The order was given in the usual calm tone.</p>
<p>"Aye aye, sir!" It was the tense voice of the helmsman.</p>
<p>"Range!" the captain commanded firmly.</p>
<p>With a sound like a gust of wind passing, the torpedoes were launched. They moved like arrows, quickly starting their silent journey. All crew members focused intently on the torpedoes' paths. Sweat dripped from the sailors' foreheads, their eyes wide with excitement, and the sound of their pulses throbbed in their ears. The officers watched the seconds tick by on the clock. Everyone was counting the seconds on their wristwatches: one second, two seconds, three seconds. It was truly the most tense moment. One sailor clasped his hands in prayer, but no one laughed at him... Suddenly, "Boom! Boom! Boom!" The sound of explosions filled the air, rocking our ship.</p>
<p>Enemy Ship Hit</p>
<p>"Hit!" The sailors couldn't help but reveal expressions of joy. Some clenched their fists and excitedly stood up.</p>
<p>"Torpedoes hit the Class A cruiser. The engine room has also been hit. The sound of the engine turning has stopped. I can only hear the sound of the destroyer's propeller spinning."</p>
<p>This was the report from the sonar room. "Boom! Boom! Boom!" More violent explosions followed. The sonar operator reported through the voice tube: "The explosions now are the sound of the Class A cruiser's ammunition exploding after the torpedo hit." Thirty seconds after the hit, the ammunition stores of the enemy Class A cruiser exploded. Our sonar could clearly hear the San Francisco sinking accompanied by the final explosion.

<h3>The Passing of Love</h3>
<p>— Also</p>
<p>"Xiao Li is in love." Among colleagues, everyone was saying this, with a slight hint of teasing and envy.</p>
<p>In the company, Xiao Li was the youngest. He was sincere, diligent, silent, and serious. He didn't smoke, didn't play mahjong, and worked diligently day and night. He also attended a cram school at night.</p>
<p>However, recently, his behavior was noticeably different. He whistled all day long, talked more, and liked to laugh and dress up. Every day, as soon as he got to the office, he would rush out, not returning to the dormitory until late at night. When asked, he would just smile, giving no definite answer. However, this anomaly was finally explained when Lao Zhang saw him walking intimately with a woman on the street.</p>
<p>Thus, the talk among colleagues was about Xiao Li being in love.</p>
<p>Yes, Xiao Li was in love.</p>
<p>His "lover" was a girl with long eyelashes, a pair of sparkling jewel-like eyes, and a round, cat-like face. People say that round-faced girls are passionate, and it was true. That small, talkative mouth was always carrying a clear smile, and her silvery laughter was full of intoxicating sweetness. Under the dense shade of trees, on the emerald green lawn, they exchanged whispered sweet nothings. Under the soft, rosy light, to the rhythm of jazz music, they danced gracefully. In the fragrant and luxurious dining room, there were their lighthearted laughter and the clinking of crystal glasses. Parks, dance halls, movie theaters, bars, coffee shops – there were few places where their footprints could not be found. Drinking the "fragrance of love," she was joyful and enchanted.</p>
<p>Late at night, he would return to the dormitory with a mixture of joy and trepidation.</p>
<p>"Xiao Li is happy," his colleagues said enviously.</p>
<p>Life continued in "happiness."</p>
<p>This "happiness" also brought noticeable changes to Xiao Li's routine life.</p>
<p>During the day, his fondness for talking and laughing naturally affected his work efficiency. His mind wandered, and he only perfunctorily dealt with his work. At night, excessive fatigue affected his energy, so he was often late, and sometimes even took sick leave.</p>
<p>His absences, lateness, and careless mistakes were noticed by the manager. One day at work, he finally saw the following announcement posted: "...Considering his past diligent work, he is temporarily allowed to stay on. A major demerit is recorded as a warning."</p>
<p>"Love is great. What's a major demerit?" Laughter rang out among his colleagues.</p>
<p>After being scolded by the manager, Xiao Li's life calmed down slightly. During the day, he regained his enthusiasm for work, and he occasionally went to the cram school at night, which he hadn't attended for nearly a month.</p>
<p>However, gray clouds quickly overshadowed this clear blue sky.</p>
<p>Xiao Li's lifestyle changed again.</p>
<p>Although he still went to the office to work every day, his expression was absentminded and dazed. He was silent, but not in a way that suggested thoughtfulness; he just stared blankly out the window at the sky. As a result, his work efficiency declined again.</p>
<p>According to A Fang, who was closest to Xiao Li, Xiao Li had been dumped. That "passionate" young woman had broken up with him. Xiao Li went to see her several times, but she refused to meet him. It wasn't until he saw her on the street arm in arm with another man, pretending not to see him, that he realized the "love" had vanished.</p>
<p>"Hey, he got what he deserved. He didn't have enough capital, but he still wanted to be in love." His colleagues' sarcastic words were like needles piercing his heart.</p>
<p>After a huge blow, and hearing these taunts and ridicule, he said helplessly:</p>
<p>"Are humans really such ruthless animals?" He was sad, depressed, and dejected.</p>
<p>Night.</p>
<p>Xiao Li staggered drunkenly home from the bar, his steps unsteady, walking along a deserted street. His swaying body lurched, bumping into a pedestrian. He groggily looked up to see a clear face and a pair of deep eyes staring at him in surprise.</p>
<p>A cool night breeze blew, and most of the alcohol dissipated. He straightened his body and respectfully called out:</p>
<p>"Mr. Liang!"</p>
<p>"Oh, is that Li Yangshan?" This familiar, kind voice was indeed Professor Liang, his Chinese language teacher from middle school.</p>
<p>"Where are you coming from? It's so late." Professor Liang said warmly, "My humble abode is just ahead. Come in and sit for a while."</p>
<p>In the small room illuminated by bright light, Xiao Li was moved by the warm affection of this kind old man.</p>
<p>He couldn't help but burst into tears.</p>
<p>Professor Liang gently stroked Yangshan's head, caressing him like a child: "Tell me, what troubles you?"</p>
<p>He then recounted his unfortunate experiences. With tearful eyes, he gazed at Professor Liang's clear face: "Is it really true that love needs money to cultivate, otherwise it will wither and fade away?"</p>
<p>"No!" Professor Liang said firmly, "Don't believe that, young man! Love nurtured by money is not true love, and it is not what we need." He paused, then continued:</p>
<p>"From the beginning, you took the wrong path. You see women as too mysterious. Do you really believe in love at first sight? Your encounter was accidental, yet you were amazed by it. Why did you only see the beauty of appearance and ignore the beauty of inner character? However, one should forgive others and examine oneself. Is it the right way to seek a woman's favor with material things, with high levels of sensual pleasure, spending money and playing around without restraint? Don't blame others. Don't you yourself have the mistaken belief that 'love needs money to cultivate'? You must first correct yourself! Even if you have ever had love, that love was built on quicksand. How fragile! Young man, forget it, consider it a dream. Use your honest means, your healthy mindset. The world is vast, and in the future, you will find your ideal lover. However, are you feeling distressed because you've been dumped? Are you feeling demoralized because of the coldness of people's hearts? This is also wrong. Why not put your interests into your work? Life is inherently about service. Why not use your passion to warm those cold hearts? People's hearts are inherently good, and the world is full of love. Young man, extend your love from narrow romantic love to love of society and love of humanity..."</p>
<p>Xiao Li listened silently. Tears of emotion flowed again.</p>

<p>Reminiscence:</p>
<p>Who remembers building the lofty skyscraper from chaotic rocks and sand?</p>
<p>Who remembers – this place is stained with blood. White bones or skeletons – perhaps! The citizens' memories have long faded</p>
<p>Occasionally, one can still vaguely imagine the shadowy figures of workers who died from tattered newspapers.</p>
<h3>Seeds</h3>
<p>In the season of melting spring mud,</p>
<p>Do you sow good seeds, or evil seeds?</p>
<p>Soon, you will reap –</p>
<p>You will receive good fruit, or evil fruit.</p>
<h3>Two Poems</h3>
<p>— Tu Xiong</p>
<p>Ashamed of Learning</p>
<p>Few know my music, no one seeks my door,</p>
<p>I regret not working harder in my cold study.</p>
<p>On long nights, sighing in the wind,</p>
<p>I only hear lonely geese weeping among the grass and insects.</p>
<p>Time</p>
<p>By the Huangpu River, many autumns have passed,</p>
<p>Bitterly chanting and slowly drinking, I compose my sorrows.</p>
<p>Years of vicissitudes have turned my hair white,</p>
<p>Leaving behind clear waves that flow with the moon. (In response)</p>
<h3>Journey of Life</h3>
<p>— Feng Han</p>
<p>In the endless darkness, we follow in the footsteps of our ancestors, in pursuit of the true meaning of life; embarking on that distant journey. There isn't a single starlight in the sky, we grope forward in the darkness, though the road is steep and uneven, full of thorns,</p>
<p>Yet we are not afraid; we have deep faith and strong will, for the purpose of life; we must move forward on that arduous journey! High mountains cannot block our path, the sea cannot stop our progress, we are burdened with the task—the light of tomorrow,</p>
<p>Regardless of deep waters and raging fires, storms and tempests, continue to move forward!</p>
<p>March on! March on! March on! Amidst the difficulties.</p>
<p>We don't know how much road we've traveled, how many years we've passed,</p>
<p>Often when we're exhausted and our bodies are pierced by thorns,</p>
<p>Though we've been discouraged and stopped moving forward, when we thought of the great mission of life we bear, we finally mustered courage, stood tall, overcame all hardships, and continued to move forward. Once, twice. Three times, we don't know how many times we've broken through the siege. On the great road of life, our footprints have been imprinted, and in our life's history, there are more traces of hard work. We will never stop moving forward until we have completed our mission and passed it on to future generations.</p>
<p>Go! Go! Go!</p>
<p>We have vaguely heard the cry of freedom, and joy fills everyone's hearts, knowing that the destination is not far away—the glimmer of dawn is at the vanguard;</p>
<p>Rally our spirits, accelerate our pace, and rush swiftly on the journey of life!</p>

<h3>Commentary on the Opening Ceremony of the Popular Cup Round Gateball Tournament: Six Teams' Skills Compared - Men's West Youth Make Technical Progress, Women's Green Team Possesses Complete Talent</h3>
<p>The Popular Cup Round Gateball Tournament, postponed twice, commenced its opening ceremony the day before yesterday (the 30th) at Guangxia Middle School. The weather that day was clear and refreshing, and as the gateball tournament didn't require tickets, no fewer than five or six thousand fans came to appreciate this novel sport. The four playing fields were packed, a scene of unprecedented grandeur. One could imagine the feelings of the inventor, Qian Xucang, smiling in a corner, and the enthusiastic hospitality of the organizer, Xia Shikui. The ceremony was quite grand, beginning with a speech by the organizer, followed by speeches from the presidium. In the first match, the opening ball was struck by elders Wen and Lin. The women's match was initiated by the "Mermaid." The mixed ball was purchased by Shen Yinshui for 30,000 yuan, and the remaining donations totaled 110,000 yuan, already distributed to various organizations. The tournament officially began at 4:00 PM. Here is a brief account of the three matches and a short commentary:</p>
<p>Hua Ying Wins Against Team V</p>
<p>A few players from Hua Ying were unable to participate due to filming commitments. Team V mainly consisted of young people from the industrial and commercial sectors, joining the team for the performance. Both teams were at the same level, but Hua Ying was superior in individual technique and consistently took the lead. The first half ended with a score of 3-0, and the final result was 6-3 in favor of Hua Ying. Both teams adopted positional offense and defense. Their advances and retreats were quite methodical. Jin Jiabiao of Hua Ying, not losing his veteran status, sought to balance offense and defense. Team V's biggest weakness was their weak offensive power. Hua Ying had ample stamina and remained calm throughout, proving themselves to be a well-trained team.</p>
<p>Green Team Defeats West Youth Women</p>
<p>After the opening ball by the "Mermaid," the Green Team immediately launched an all-out offensive, their forwards exceptionally active. The West Youth women, relying solely on their robust physiques, were unable to withstand the Green Team's threat. Therefore, the Green Team dominated the first half, leading 2-0. In the second half, the Green Team relaxed slightly, and West Youth Women narrowed a comfortable 3-0 lead to a 3-3 tie. Ultimately, Yan Weiwen's skillful shot from the corner secured the victory, with a final score of 4-3 in favor of the Green Team, crowning them champions of the women's round gateball world. Women's round gateball is still a relatively rare sport. The fans' excitement was concentrated, making it one of the most interesting scenes of the tournament. In terms of overall technique, the Green Team's offense used positional attacks and corner attacks from both wings. Their defense employed positional defense and man-to-man marking. The reasons for conceding three goals were: Ling Bao's laziness on the first goal and Yin Lan's carelessness on the third. The four West Youth women relied entirely on their abundant strength, rapid running, and height. Individually, Huang Jiao Yuan of the Green Team was quite skilled at scoring. Yan Weiwen was full of energy, perhaps a little overzealous. Wang Weizhen's man-marking skills were top-notch. Miss Zhu was able to diligently fulfill her defensive duties in her assigned position. Rong Shujian and Li Zhizhi made no mistakes, maintaining their veteran status. For West Youth women, Lin Nuofu and Susan were the best, their shooting posture quite beautiful and their shots very accurate. The rest were average, relying only on strength. Judging by the Green Team's technique and complete talent, they can be considered dominant in Shanghai.</p>
<p>West Youth Wins Against Paramount</p>
<p>The match was unexpectedly lopsided, with the main reason being the incomplete roster of Paramount's players. West Youth consistently led, with a score of 6-2 in the first half and a final score of 8-4, a resounding victory for West Youth. Both teams adopted man-to-man marking strategies. However, West Youth skillfully utilized corner attacks from both wings. The shots of Funike and Tao Bolingji were extremely skillful, with excellent angles. They also had a special tactic of letting the ball bounce on the ground one yard in front of the goal before entering, making Paramount's goalkeeper Yao Chong completely helpless. He was unable to save dangerous shots, a departure from his usual prowess. One cannot help but admire the technical progress of West Youth. Du Bensen and Bao Songyuan of Paramount were tall and possessed outstanding individual skills, but unfortunately, the entire team was assembled hastily, resulting in a crushing defeat. If they could reorganize themselves, it wouldn't be impossible to compete with West Youth on equal terms.</p>
<p>Notes from Behind the Scenes</p>
<p>Due to the crowds, some members of the gang climbed onto the basketball hoops in the arena. Because of the large number of people, the hoops collapsed, seriously injuring a young student. Nails pierced the top of his head, causing profuse bleeding. He was later sent to the hospital.</p>
<p>Paramount player Bao Songyuan and referee Wu Zibin nearly came to blows due to a disagreement, but were calmed down after much persuasion.</p>
<p>A certain reporter intended to copy the names from the platform but was refused by a certain staff member, who said that without an invitation, he was not allowed on the platform. The reporter silently retreated. However, this staff member was certainly being excessively rigid. (Reply Guaranteed)</p>
<h3>Matters that Athletes Should Pay Attention To: Amateur Sports Rules (Continued)</h3>

<p>Article 13: Amateur athletes may not receive direct or indirect compensation for joining a sports association or other sports organization as a member or for their membership status.</p>
<p>Article 14: Amateur athletes should issue receipts for any reimbursements they receive. These receipts should be properly kept for inspection by national formal sports organizations at any time.</p>
<p>Article 15: Anyone who sells sporting goods is not considered an amateur athlete.</p>
<p>Article 16: Amateur athletes may not receive compensation for using the products of a certain company, factory, or distributor; nor may they use their names for advertising or promote the products of a certain company or factory for compensation.</p>
<p>Article 17: Amateur athletes may not use their portraits for shop advertisements.</p>

<p>Article 20: Amateur competitions shall not be promoted for the benefit of individuals.</p>
<p>Article 21: Amateur athletes may not serve as reporters for newspapers in any sports competition (or part of a competition) in which they participate and receive money for it.</p>
<p>Article 22: When competing abroad, amateur athletes may, with the special permission of the national formal sports organization, receive money to cover expenses for transportation, accommodation, or other personal items. (End)</p>
<h3>Introducing Training Equipment Gymnasiums to Young People</h3>
<p>There are many types of sports, such as track and field, ball games, and water sports. However, when it comes to participation, there is either a lack of people or not enough space. Therefore, these sports are not accessible to everyone. As for equipment exercises, the practice is relatively simple and the effectiveness is also significant. In Shanghai, there are many places that are open to our young people to practice equipment exercises. The Quanyou Sports Association (annual fee of 30 yuan), located in the Cishu Building on Nanjing Road; the Shanghai Physical Education Academy (at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Hartung Road), which has effective teaching methods; the modern gymnasium with contemporary features (on Wannaiyi Road); the aristocratic Bailei (on Maidachesituo Road); and the Eight Immortals Bridge Chinese YMCA and the Fourth Overseas Chinese Youth Association (limited to Baojia youth groups) for coping, are all worth introducing to our youth.
