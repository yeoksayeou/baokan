<h3>新聞記者大會的任務</h3>
<p>第三次大東亞新聞記者大會，今天起於東京舉行。在大東亞會議甫告閉慕，劃時期的大東亞宣言發表以後，接着有新聞記者大會的舉行，就宣揚大東亞宣言的要義，喚起全亞洲人民團結一致，爭取大東亞戰爭勝利的觀點而言，是會之六人行，實為異常重要的措施。</p>
<p>現代戰爭的勝負，並不取決於單純的軍事力量，其他如政治，經濟，文化各方面，都是鬥爭的單位，所以說，現代戰爭是「總力戰」。這種認識，已經很普遍，無待詳細的解釋了。宣傳是文化中的一個部門，宣傳戰是總力戰中很主要的一種。新聞專業又是宣傳中主要項目，所以，新聞事業在戰爭中的力量，是十分重要的。這次新聞記者會議，在爭取大東亞戰爭勝利的意義上，更有其極關重要的地位的。</p>
<p>大東亞會議所發表的共同宣言，巳經芷確的昭示我們全亞洲人的共同目標。同時，我們對於大東亞戰爭的勝利，已經有了共同的信念。目標旣經確定，信念旣經建立，祗須在軍事，政治，經濟，文化各方面，相互配合，各就本位，按照步驟，努力邁進。就道一見解，我們對於今次大東亞新聞記者會議的任務，提供如下的兩點：</p>
<p>第一，如何喚起全亞洲人民的責任心？大東亞戰爭勝利與共榮圈的完成，有着不可分離的關繫。而共榮圈的能否完成，直接決定亞洲各國家各民族的前途命運。因此，貢獻一切力量於戰爭，是每個亞洲人的責任；從事共榮圈的建設，是每個亞洲人的義務。卽不能諉卸責任，叉不可逃避義務。而且這種責任與義務，必須共同負擔，始能　致實效，決非日本單獨負担所能支撑大局的。</p>
<p>第二，如何介紹日本國內的一般戰時實況？日本創導大東亞主義，發動大東亞戰爭，居於領導地位，在二年來的戰爭中，節節勝利，事實上獨當一面，擊潰頑敵，絕非倖致，而必有充足的準備與堅實的力量。所以，其國內實况以及國民的戰時情緖，在在可供每個亞洲國家的人民倣效次會議，到達東京之日對日本記者謂：「此次來日，已為第三次，沿途所見，感覺日本已無閒人，亦無一物浪費，人力物力，均已動員。此在中國做未能做到，實感慚愧。即此亦為吾人應倣效日本者」。為動員總力，配合軍事，全亞洲國家，自應以日本為模範，做到無一人閒着，無一物浪費，</p>
<p>這兩點我們認為並不是空泛的意見，而是最基本的工作原則，希望大會代表應就此原則交換意見，融會一貫，如果並此而不能做到，則一切動人的議案，都不免落空的。</p>
<p>新聞記者為時代的先鋒，是行動的前驅，憑一枝禿筆，有傳檄天下振聾發瞶之力量，有為民喉舌導於正義之效能，在戰時尤為最有力的戰士，因為闡揚國策，喚起民衆，他們是最適任者。現在大東亞戰爭，旣己有共同目標與共同信念，就須各自喚起人民的責任心，介紹日本戰時實况，勉勵人民做效，堅定共同信念，齊向共同目標邁進。願與會代表三致意之！</p>

<h3>田中德富兩氏　發表感想</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日本新聞會會長田中都吉·日本言論報國會會長兼日本文學報國會會長德寫豬一耶兩氏，對新聞大會述其感想如次：</p>
<p>田中都吉氏：大東亞新聞記者大會，實具有重大意義，大東亞地城，義因英美之宣傳而充英美思想，東亞之根本精神反而衰頹，但大東亞戰爭爆發後，已以軍事力量，將英美勢力完全遂出。其所餘之思想殘渣，當由吾新開界將之肅淸，以奠定大東亞共榮圈之思想基礎，此更為吾人新聞界之一大光榮使命。基此以言，此大會之意義實為深長，同時更期望類似此種之會議今後時常舉行，俾大東亞新聞人多有接觸理解，促進相亙協力之機會。</p>
<p>德富豬一則：大東亞新聞詫者大會之舉行，實可謂為最得時宜，故除於表示吾等言論人之滿腔熱意外，並願深表祝意、本月六日　，巳右歷史　的火東亞宜言，實為貫澈干古人類生存之指引，確立世界和平之憲章。英。美帝國主義之實體，不外為侵喀掠奪，議詐欺瞞而大，東亞共同宣言，亦即對英美流商業文化之當頭棒，大東亞宣言基於「古今分　中外分悔」為根底之思想，顯現亞細亞十憶民族於此才能得睛光明，常固共自覺與價念，此精神之最終目的，乃在確立世界和平。全亞細亞必須右道義之團結，今則亞洲總倔起總進軍之基礎已告確立，實踐綱領，已明顯揭出，普及此綱領之意義，實為當前急務，負起此糧賣任者，即為指導輿論之新聞界，故新聞界之任務，實至重且大。亞洲之解放，必須將英美勢力驅出之後才得實現，日本為擊滅不顧道義，蔑視公理之英美，乃挺身戰爭，日軍之雄偉及日本解放亞洲精精，已　分表現於現實，英美敗退，已至為明顯，亞洲總倔起之秋，今已到來，吾人必須集結總力，摧毀英美之支配勢力與彼等之舊秩序，向立足於道義之新秩序前進。在此時機，得睹大東亞新聞記者大會之舉行，為亞洲之興隆，為世界之和平，吾人不勝欣喜。</p>

<p>東京十六日中央社電　日靑木大東亞相重光外相於十六日晚聯合設宴款待王委員長，由靑木大東亞相代表主人方面致歡迎辭，其大意謂：王委員長閣下，於時局嚴重之際，再度出長華北，實深感佩。余前於北京會暗閣下時，曾承告以關下之決意，謂　安定華北民生，增進中日兩國之親善關係，決不顧身家竭力以赴云、其　之悲　殊值路感。此次改革華北政委會之機構，刷新政務，余確信華北之安定，對中國之建設貨獻必多。誠如閣下所如中日關係自本年初以來，即有劃期之進展、貴國四億民衆百年以來所翼求之取消不平等條約巳告實現，中國之地位已行提高，貴我兩國更於本年十月三十日簽訂盟約、中日關係更　明朗。最近向中外闡明之大東亞宣言，中臼兩國已表明決與其榮圈內其他諸國互相提携，建設共有共榮之大東亞，以貢獻　世　之進展。同顧中日兩國不幸因惑於英美奸計發生爭鬥，已右相常　　、然自英美勢力被驅出束亞以後，中臼兩國即恢復其本然之姿態。發揚兩國應循之正確大道，互相提携向前邁進，殊値欣慰。華北各地理藏各種重要資源甚豐，此等資源之開發，不僅　益巾日兩國產業之發達　民生之向上。且與完成大東亞戰爭，關係殊深。王委員長閣下於此次改革政委會行政機構時，會力言華北在汪主席領導下，增強戰力，發揮總力，以完成後方之使命，此則尤令吾人銘感。此次委員　特於政務　忙中訪問敵國，為適應新事態、與敝國政府要人舉行懇談，以便充分　通意志　以願關下返國後，以確固不助之決意，致力建設中國，　進中日　呼、</p>

<p>東京十六日中央社電　國府華北政委會委員長　克敏氏、十六日十四時在此間旅　帝國飯店，接　日本讀者發表愁話如次、本人此次　臨貴國，乃屬第四次，這一次到貴國來，是因鄙人重負華北主任，覺得華北在大東亞戰爭中所佔地位，所負靑任非常重要。今後一切措施不能不請求貴國政府遇事支採。在此略作就任後的寒喧，同時和貴國人士懇談交換意　。記得第一次即明治三十六年到貴國來，不久日俄戰爭即開始，那時看到貴國舉國上下一致總動員的精神，所以戰勝了俄國，這次本人到來，看到貴國人士在決戰體制之下，都能夠深切理解戰爭的眞意，洞悉國家政策的方針，各本職域奉公的精神，表現出緊張邁進的情緒，更是超過臼俄戰爭的精神之上，根據這一點，我們確信貴國一定能聯合東亞各國負起興亞的責任，一定能擊減英美解放東亞，取得最後勝利。鄙人自從日俄戰爭後，就主張中日兩國合作。事實告訴我們，日本對華政策的精神始終是一貫的，這就是東亞的道義精神，從近衛首相的聲明起直到中日同盟條紙，始終是貫澈着這種道義精神。這一點中國民衆是十分理解的，尤共在本年一月九日我國政府參戰，同時中日簽訂交還租界及撤廢治外法權的協定。臼本方面答應中國改府的事情，一件一件的逐漸實施，所有這些事實，增進中國民衆對於日本的信賴，加強兩國間合作的關係。十月三十日巾日同盟條約的締結，在東亞外交　上又開了一個新紀元，由於這個同盟的結成，不僅中日關係達到更進一以的境地，中國巳且有復興的牢固，同時　邦日本在大東亞共榮中，也得到一個獨立自主的盟友。白從緬何非律賓在日本支援下獲得獨立後，印度也成立了臨時政府，　是東亞民族的大團結遂告完成。華北是大東亞戰爭的生塵基地，所負使命既異常重大，所以自從大東亞戰爭發生以來，就着着強化決戰體制，在政治方面最要緊的是肅淸貪汚，勵行廉潔政治，以期樹立革新政治體制。在經濟方面，最大問題是增加生產開發資源，以完成　產基地的使命。現在華北的增產情形漸見進步，政府方面斟酌時宜釐定種種方策逐步推行，民衆方面都能理解政府意旨表示協力，官民一心共同邁進，所以華北的增塵前途是樂觀的。華北不但是生產基地，更在大東亞佔着防共的主要地位，在此地位更加重大，因而擊減共匪，確保治安，使成為華北的最重要工作。本八此次重負華北重任，深切感到中”兩國對大東亞所負責任之重大，希望最國朝野人士時時予以指敎。</p>

<p>汪主席訓辭</p>
<p>南京十六日中央社電　主席於第一次全國衛生行政會議訓話原文：國民政府　都以來，今日才開第一次全國衛生行政會議，許多衛生行政長官及專家，都來參加，實在是一件極右希望，及極可欣慰的事。</p>
<p>兄弟打算關於大局先說幾句話，再說衛生行政貢獻一點意見。</p>
<p>先就大局來說，國家前途是很光明的，然而人民痛苦却還很深。何以說，國家前途是光明的呢？中日同盟條約已經締結，除了條約，只有一個附屬議定嘗，及一道　文，此外任何秘密文件都沒有。跟着大束亞宜言也是這樣，東亞各國獨立自主，共存共榮，共同打倒英美重新開始道義精神的建設，國家前途的光明，是亳無疑義的了。何以說人民痛苦還是很深呢，全面和平尚未實現，大東亞戰爭還未完遂，人民痛苦有些是無可避免的，右些是可以減輕的。舉個例來說，全面和平尚未恢復，匪共到處搔擾，妨害生產，陳礙交通，以致米的產量逐日戚少，同時南洋方面，因為戰爭關係，運輸困難，米的入口沒有一定的日期和數量，這些都是無可避免的痛苦。唯有鼓起刻苦耐勞的心情，共同忍受。至於統制方法，未盡適當，行政組織未盡合理，官吏有金汚行為，不良軍隊有騷擾事實，這些都是應該盡心盡力，隨行矯正，以期減輕人民的痛苦。兄弟對於大局簡單的報告，盡於此了。</p>
<p>再就衛生行政來說，在還都之初，從前的中央醫院，為友軍借用，只有內政部所屬的一間醫院，在中國銀行地址開設，連病床也沒有，　多病人明坐着人力車囘去，死在半途的也有，許多產婦也是如此，說起來實在痛心。還都三年，財政未有基礎，許多要做的事，都不能做，幸而有一位吳澤元先生，捐了數十萬元，再加上政府的籌劃，纔勉强的設了幾十張病床，收容病重的人，但還是很不夠，所以不能不建築一座新的醫院。南京市民將近有一百萬，連一間啓院都沒有，這是萬萬不成的，當時政府很費籌劃，才籌劃出這一筆建築費和設備費，當時感覺費用太多，如今想起物價相差不止數十倍了。有了醫院後，　得有一班醫生，由香洪而來如黎院長等、辛苦支持，又有今日的地位，然而這仍只能從都市起點，決不能注重都市而忽略了鄉村，尤其不能法重首都，而忽略了全國。所以跟着有衛生署的組織，幸而又有上海的着名醫生，如現在的陸署長遠來担任。以上所說，都是幾年來一點一滴的積纍，兄弟自已實在感覺到對民衆不起，但是在大東亞戰爭期間，醫學設備與醫藥材料，從歐美來的幾乎絕跡，敵國固然不能來，就是友邦也不能來，那麼只右借助於盟邦日本了。但是日本自己正在獨立支持大東亞戰爭，不但醫學設艱，醫藥材料，我們不能夠有奢望，就是醫學人材，也有許多去常兵的，那麼中國的衛生行政就不能不求自己。於無可設法之中，盡力設法，當然盟邦日本的援助，我們是感謝的，不過我們不能奢望，豈止於此。我們還要站在共同戰勝的立塲，盡力的訓練醫學人材，收集醫藥材料，以期有所貢獻於大東亞戰爭的戰士呢。（未完明日緩）</p>
<h3>建部注意　護路工作</h3>
<p>南京十六日中央社電　建設部前舉辦愛護鐵路強化還，組轍愛路視察團，全體二十一人，於上月二十八臼出發。至本月三日返京，計視察右安徽省當涂縣。江蘇省寫山縣，浙訌省江寗縣等地。沿遂視察情况，業由建設部技監處交通路綫愛護工作委員會副主任委員張鑾，會同擬具，答呈報告。記者昨晤張副主任委員、詢以此行視察觀感，常經答復，略謂此次沿路視察，一般成結表現，均甚良好。然鐵道愛護。本為艱巨工作，須政府機關與愛路百姓，打成一片。軍需與盟邦駐軍取得緊密連洛，方能收獲實效。對百姓必須剴切宣傳，使護路意義，深八農村，成為一種民德，共同遵守。對護路團員之福利工作亦須力求發展，以為獎勵。總之，以往之努力。業巳收獲相當效果，今後更須本此精神，勇往　進，以達到護路之最要目的。</p>
<h3>調整中日合辦公司　即可協義完畢　蠶絲鹽業兩公司改組</h3>
<p>南京十六日中央社電　事變以機，我國經濟命脈之各重要事業，均經破壞無遺，幸賴盟邦當局從事整領，力圖恢復。國府還都後，各重要企業公司，根據經濟提携之精神，卽由中日雙方合辦。三年以來，已奠定我經濟復興基礎。茲者盟邦日本，為促使我經濟建設躍進，以分擔大東亞共同建設起見，乃將原來之各項合辦公司，加以進一步之調整，以加強國府經濟基礎。此事於中日盟約簽頂後，更為積極。雙方有關人員，刻正縝密協議調整方案，第一次首先實施調整，計右華中蠶絲及華中鹽業兩公司，已於上月三十日正式發表，實仃撤消及改組。茲悉關於其他各合辦公司，亦將於本月底以前，協議完畢，不久即可全部實施調整。今後國府經濟建設情形，定將因此次合辦公司之調整，而得有進一步之劃期發展。</p>
<h3>渝軍將兵　戰意全消</h3>
<p>仰光十六日中央社電　渝新編第三十三師諜報隊員嚴海淸（三十一歲湖北人）及第二軍諜報隊第一組曹　祥（二十八歲四川省人），前於十月六日在印緬邊境被日軍俘虜，彼等就渝軍喪失戰意之情形述稱，渝第九師第二十七團第一營第一連於本年六月二十五日在瓦城方面景强帕地方　滾弄東九公里）已被日軍完全殲滅，故新舞第三十三師將兵已深知日軍精强無比，而戰意全失，其作戰惟迫於長官命令而已，且軍紀風紀亦極紊亂，如八月下旬駐屯耿馬之新編第三十三師九十七團第八連連長因尅扣軍餉，致連排長問發生衝突，其第一排長逾率士兵八十名逃亡，又因對軍餉不滿，各營逃亡士兵每日均不下五六名，此外軍隊掠奪住民食品，衣服，金屬品等暴行亦層出不窮，同時更因瘧疾肺炎赤痢等傳染病流行，而各發僅有軍醫一人，且醫術共幼稚，藥品亦缺乏，極難預防，各營每月平均有十二人因患瘧疾死亡云。</p>
<h3>泰國防相　人選決定</h3>
<p>盤谷十六日中央社電　泰國國防相向由畢本首相兼任，泰政府十五日公布已決定起用現國防軍副最高指揮官培齊德中將為專任國防相，同時並拔昇納龍氏為次官。</p>
<h3>澳洲聯邦　總督易人</h3>
<p>里斯本十六日中央社電　據倫敦消息：白金罕宮本臼宣布：已委任格羅斯特公解繼高里勳爵為澳洲總督。高氏現年七十一歲，任澳督業已七戲，為歷任總督之任期最久者，新總督尚未有啓程赴任之確切準備。</p>
<h3>埃及國王　覆車受傷</h3>
<p>安加拉十六日中央社電　據海通社訊：開羅官方宣稱：矣及國王法魯克一世，昨乘汽車失事受塲，其傷勞是否嚴重。則並無宣佈。</p>
<h3>齊托密爾前綫　德展開反攻　蘇軍楔形推進被遏阻</h3>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　據海通社訊；上還末蘇軍在基輔以西之大規模進攻，雖獲得相常成功，於巷戰後追德軍退出齊托密爾，但在基輔西北之柯洛斯頓方面則甚少進步，向塞柯夫方面之推進，已被德軍之障碍陣地所阻。蘇聯伐都丁將軍之軍隊，在上過末向齊托密爾推進時，其凹入之側翼曾被德軍之猛擊，蘇軍現正欲擴展其楔形陣地，即欲向齊托密爾之南北分開，現正與德軍劇戰中。敵軍現向聶伯河東流用步兵十師及坦克車隊二團進攻。惟迄今尚無突襲之行動，僅用優勢之人力在克里伏洛格以北佔領若干土地，並已被德軍之反攻所阻。蘇軍曾數次向德軍陣地之東部猛攻，但終未選，惟敵軍在該區繼續施壓力。貝萊科普土股僅右局部戰事，寇許島半島敵軍攻勢迄未稍衰，惟甚少進步。在斯聯倫斯克與明斯克公路及奧爾　方面，敵軍加緊壓迫，大隊敵軍在本區之集中，顯示敵後備軍初未涸場。</p>
<h3>印獨立聯盟支部　柏林開慶祝大會</h3>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　印度獨立聯艱歐洲支部　十五日下午在此間舉行慶祝自由印度臨時政府成立大會，到右日駐德大島大使·德外次凡普列爾。及軸心各國代表數百名，加以於德國防軍下編成之印獨立軍將兵代表參加者共約五白人。印度獨立聯盟歐洲代表那比阿爾，說明該臨時政府成立經過後，復謂印度獨立運動迄一九四三年十月廿一日，已八於決定的階段，確價此運助最後必能得到閱滿成功。英國之統治印度，從不顧印度人之利害，孟加拉等省已餓斃數百萬印人，此常為英人暴虐之證明。今印度人已確信須以實際戰鬥，方能擭得獨立。江特拉鮑斯氏即具有指導印人從事戰鬥之一切必要條件之鬥士云云。最後助證德外長里資特絡甫宣長郭培爾及義大使等之祝辭而散會。</p>
<h3>印度糧荒　依然嚴重</h3>
<p>里斯本十六日中央社電　據孟買官方報告稱：加爾各答區餓斃印人已達三七。八〇〇，該處之飢荒　　仍極嚴重，預料將有更多人民死亡。</p>
<h3>歸國日僑　談美國內幕</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　前夏或夷日本時事新聞主筆淺見氏此次搭日美交換船帝亞丸歸國後，待發表前於拘留所所見美國內幕之一斑情形如次：美國報紙對於戰况之報道極為荒繆，每日第一版皆備戰虛偽之戰勝消息，美戰時情報局為抑壓國民之厭戰情緒，始採取此宣傳方針。惟屬可笑者，即其報紙之第一版雖盡量揭載有關勝利之虛備宣傳，而在第四版或第五版評論欄中，則屢見有日大本　之發表以否定美方發表之實際情形。美國報紙　亦最普還　載東京廣播消息，同時日大本營之發表亦每　一兩日即於各交戰國之「戰况公表欄」中刋出。但最近不知是否某於情報局之方針，日大本營之艱表已不輕易揭載，此足證美國人已有不信任美政府之發表，而深感日大本營發表為正確之傾向。日本之短波放送因輿論甚佳，故美國家庭收聽日本廣播者為數頗衆，由美國報紙所見，近巳逐漸強調日本為強敵，並時作警語謂，美國乃自建國以來首次與有如日本之可怕強敵交戰，如不能堅強以赴，作戰敗北實有遭遇滅亡之危險。</p>
<h3>波報大捷特輯</h3>
<p>如何迎接大捷報</p>
<p>大捷報終於來了。在南海苦戰總年，沒沒無聞，使我們國民的心緒，懸念不置。然而這句日來，前綫將士不屈不撓的努力結實了，在海上，在空中，擊破了敵的進攻。這捷報常留在耳邊的今日，大本營又發表說這是夏威夷海戰以來初次的大捷報。我們的欣喜·感動·無以復加。</p>
<p>敵人的狼狽</p>
<p>由於所羅門羣島的奪囘，到今日為止敵人就難道甘心嗎？但他們並不那樣愚蠢，不知道日軍的強大。這旬日來，敵人的強襲作戰，即為欲滿足其野心而前來進攻，說明敵人是怎樣地焦慮着短期作戰。他們覺悟到須付相當鐵牲，但寬敢於進攻。可是其結果如何？戰艦三艘擊沉，一　重傷，巡洋艦二艘炸沉、大型巡洋艦三艘以上重傷，遭遇了殲滅的　績·因敗績而茫然自失的敵軍將士，及接到這敗報而狠狽的敵國首腦部人員，他們驚慌臉色，如在我們面前。企圖進犯神州者的運命，固應如此。</p>
<p>我們的警惕</p>
<p>但我們聽到這大戰果時，不只是欣喜雀躍。首先打動我們國民的心者，還大戰果實上賴大元帥陛下的天威，我們應如何上副聖意。其次，乃造成這大戰果的帝國海軍航空隊一死報國，盡忠的精神。這樣大的戰果，僅由航空部隊的力量獲致，使我們祗有驚嘆。據發表我方損害有自炸未還者十五架，對此，我們不能不更肅然正襟。我勇敢的海軍羣，追逐大敗驚走的敵艦隊和運輸船團，不顧燃料盡後，將為浮屍，而拼命追擊，日本悠久的光榮，實由這不惜身命的精神建造成功基礎。我們的感激，更非筆墨言語所能形容。</p>
<p>戰力的增强</p>
<p>此次的大戰果，不難　測在今後南方的戰局上，有重大的影響，敵人不能不再檢討其以前所取的戰略。局時，美國的首腦者們，怎樣再欺瞞其不知戰爭目的何在的民衆，今後將更困難吧！可是敵人不會就此甘休，終將繼續反攻戰。勝而毋驕！我們決不應沉醉於這戰果。敵人頗有相當決意進行短期作戰，後方國民今日所應該做的，應更進一步強化決戰態勢，一億人民携起手來共同邁逖。增強戰力是最最必要的。緊張的心片刻也不能鬆弛下來。那覺悟和不退縮的努力，是我們所酬謝於造成這大戰果的許多英靈者。（翔：譯自十一月十日西部每日新聞）</p>
<p>德國的反響</p>
<p>美艦隊出擊前，麥克沃塞在西南太平洋反軸心軍特別會議上誇稱：「假使日本海軍前來，我將不勝歡迎，我將用所右的力量，包括重轟炸在內，典之周旋。」又美國海軍長官諾克斯在新聞會見席上也稱：「美海軍準備隨時隨地與日本海軍決戰。」但靠着其飛機之量的優勞，一面拽尋日本艦隊，一面北上中的敵艦隊，在臼本勇敢的電擊機之前，終致葬身魚腹。日本朝臼新聞社為探詢德國對此的反響如何，於十一月九日夜接通國際電話與守山，　本及從羅馬同柏林的衣奈特派員還話如次：問　第二次玻根維甭島空戰的消息何時在柏林發表？答　今晨九時左右，即日本時間午後五時左右，用無綫電作為特別發表廣掛的。問　呵！呵！特別發表嗎？答　此前的第一次玻根維爾鳥空戰，擊沈美國航空母艦二艘時，也用特別發表。此次有還樣大的戰果，當然也如此。問　反響如何？德國大機也很快慰吧！答　在玻根維爾為殲減美艦隊的捷報，立即由無綫電向德國全國大事報這。總國也為這捷報而鼎沸了。在東部戰綫繼續猛烈戰事的今日，見到盟邦臼本的勝利而欣喜，井不是無理的。因為打敗的敵人是日德共同的敵人啊！三日前，聽說擊沈美國航空母艦二艘，巡洋艦四艘的大戰果，德國民衆已很驚異，現在接到這大勝的捷報，更讚歎日本海軍的偉大。而德國民衆待別為之感動者，是這戰果由於數量上較敵人為寡的海軍航空部隊所造成的。懷着魚曾捨身向敵艦突擊，遺種精神，實是大和魂的象微，現在更有新的認識了。不僅如此，每一個國民，燃起旺盛的鬥志，確信最後的勝利而戰，且　加深其對日本的信賴。問　軍事專門家的署法如何？答　晚報還沒有出，所以尚朱看見報上的評論。綜合各方面所聽到的，經過這一囘二度的殲減戰之後，西南大平洋的美國海軍將潛踪絕跡。美國方面此次出動這樣有力的艦隊，可見其反攻的規模非常偉大。日本海軍航空部隊的威力。美國海軍知這得很詳細，但竟敢於　這危險者，實因自去年八月的進攻瓜島以來，對遲遲不進的戰局，美國大感焦燥。最近因已準備相當軍備，乃從事大規模反攻。對此，日本海軍一步一步有計劃的韓進，引誘敵人，但一方面嚴密準備，時機一至，即加以痛擊。那機會此次來了。日本海軍的威力，和臼本海軍作戰的優秀，全世界都署得淸淸楚學了。因此的慘敗，自去年八月以來敵方在西南太平洋上苦心孤詣慘　經營所獲的戰國盡成泡影。（翔：釋自十一月十日西部朝日新開）</p>

<h3>對大東亞宣言　聞蘭亭氏談話　發表希望三點</h3>
<p>中央社訊　大東亞會議發表共同宣言後，本市各界或表興慰，中央社記者昨特走訪聞蘭事氏，承發表談話云；「中日同盟條約，甫於十月三十日在南京簽　，而大東亞會議即於本月五日在日本東京相繼舉行，此含有歴史性之會議，不僅與東亞各民族發展上有很深遠之意義，即在世界和平方面，亦有莫大實獻，東亞各民族以此會議而建立了共存其榮之秩序，以道義精神，確定了民族間親和之友誼，以互　下之緊密提携，發展各民族之經濟。凡我工商經濟界人士，際此戰爭期問，自當勇猛　進，克亦　戰，協遂戰爭之勝利　　　東亞　史展開斬的一面，則尤應認淸目標把握現實。第一我國向以地大物博著稱世界，其所以經濟不能繁榮發展者，實因科學與技術之不發達，故今後希望其他各民族贊助於我者，惟科學　技術而已。第二際此戰爭時期，人民生活極為艱苦，節省物力以工獻國家，本為人民　盡之義務，然而改善民生發展民族經濟。尤為當務之急，蓋民生之安定，實為爭取勝利之重要關　，希望各國元首及與會代表，對此應予深切注意，更以集體力量·共謀根本之解決。最後我國生產落後，固因科學與技術不發進所致，但贊本不能集中，於作積極生產事上之投資，亦為一大原因，工商界應迎合當前歷史之需要，舉辦各種生產事業，以東獻於國家買獻於東亞，甚至貧戲於世界，如此才稱完成工商紹濟界之責任」。</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>經濟健康</h3>
<p>日前本報星期評論曾　載吉田東結氏論健康一文，建議開放　區的猶太商鉅產哈同花園，　為公園，任滬市居民游息其間，以增　其健康。這一個建議。自為每一市民所雙　。</p>
<p>本來，當此戰亂時代，　　增產同題日形嚴重，所有私人花園　，廉設法　出地位，改為市民　團，以實救濟糧食恐慌於萬一。哈同花團為敵產之一，佔地二百餘　之多，早應改為　圃，俾切實用。今吉田氏主張闢為公園，以供大衆避　休息，共對社會的功用，也許不在國為園圃之下，因為市民對於糧食菜蔬的需要，圃甚迫切，但新鮮空氣與正當娛樂的需要，亦不可少，因為無新鮮空氣與正當娛樂以為綢劑，人體即無健康之可言；無健康之身體，即無生產之能力。所以我們對於吉田氏的建議，也是十二分贊成的。</p>
<p>不過，除掉哈同花團而外，還有一塊廣大空地，也是敵產之一，而其地位且較哈同花園更為適中，其面積亦較哈同花園更為廣闊，何不圖為公園，以供大衆遊　？這一塊廣大空地就是全滬市民所熟識的跑馬應。在世界各大都市中，公園平均面積之最小者，恐怕要稱上海了！滬市當局實宜以吉田氏的建議為中心，開放哈同花園和跑馬聽而外，更進而進行整殖滬市四郊荒地，仿照俄京辦法，闢為市民園團。如此，市民旣多正當游　之所，即可於無形中節約許多不必要的消耗，且在糧食菜蔬之生產上，亦有　當的補助，可以說是由市民身體之健康，促成都市經濟之俾康。</p>
<h3>銀聯會錢庫等　調金融市面　嚴格限制各業貸款</h3>
<p>銀行聯合準備委員會　錢業聯合華備庫為防投　囤　操從起見，實施緊縮同業拆放後，各行壯對於各業貸放不得不特別審愼，業已教效。整個市面，已趨穩定，頃悉銀聯會對於會員行莊因業務上需要，得提供財產為担保品</p>
<p>申請拆借一切依照</p>
<p>拆借新辦法辦理，惟各錢莊之拆借歸錢庫代辦，總額以五千萬元為限，所以各行莊得銀聯會調劑後，均能應付裕如，至於各業因正當用途，如發展生產事業，收買農產品原料等，得依照銀錢業兩公會所訂之放款新辦法，及財政部所頒佈之跟制放款辦法，與各行莊</p>
<p>接洽借款</p>
<p>經審查合格後即予貸款，利率則參酌市面情形隨時商　之，故目前市面之銀根雖較前為緊，為杜絕投機囤積之好現象，惟整個金融仍依然穩定如恒云。</p>
<h3>證券交易所取締　市場外交易</h3>

<p>新藥新亞大關被入後囘出，終與中法均軋升；五洲仍疲；新星亦稍囘升；中西信誼九福製藥均平　金融　升降互見，上海浙與均見做高；金城　業高不止，極少售出；世界平渡。</p>

<h3>駐印度的　英美空軍眞相</h3>
<p>— 大澤寬三</p>
<p>價察機方面，美國所用的計北美B二五型，洛基特P三八型·華特　果爾斯墓P四U—一型，寇蒂斯P四〇型。英機有斯比特發亞偵察機一中隊。</p>
<p>除B二五型以外，其餘均為敵所自　的戰鬥機，當作近距離高　　　　　　·其中　　三八　，有　　　　　動　　特的高　·用金　可在七〇〇〇米以上　察，　　　　　　　先敗，故改用傳值察　·</p>
<p>又昆明附近的駐舉美空軍亦為日本駐緬旬方面的陸軍航空部隊對手。計有戰斗機九〇架，轟炸機約四十架，共計一三〇架左右，常對上緬匐作游擊　動。此方面的美國戰鬥機隊，係　次在空中戰中所生殘者，在空戰中，尤以聶炸欐，但均被日軍戰鬥機隊擊退。</p>
<p>美國尚從印度對一空　日本本土的基地」中國用空中運　運送B——二四等轟炸機，一方面並把重廣軍運印度，以因印度的防備。用航空運愉所輸送的新編三〇師四六二〇〇名中，已有二七七七〇名（內將校二九五〇名）。最近每日平均有六〇架B二潤　個養　　　慶中　　，　　於中國的一成，即僅六架。</p>
<p>駐華英美空軍有印度人航空部隊十一個中　，　據　其內幕頗不和睦，問題　雜，但對美國空軍的轟炸機隊，必須深加注意。</p>
<p>就這些轟炸隊的俘據看來，均僅有十個月左右的練習訓練　即橫淚大西洋，經非洲而至前綫，眞正的飛行時間大約僅六　小時左右，即乘聶炸機運至印度。從其訓練而曾是速成的，和戰鬥機不同的轟炸機，把所載的炸彈擲落就算任務完了，他們的理解祗能夠知道如何動作的實際事情　可是在飛行員方面雖靠不住，但如　編成大隊飛行，能夠在雲層中飛行相當時間　也能夠作夜間轟炸，在這裹，我們不能不承認敵機機材上的某種程度的優越性。他們專　其機材上簡單，緊實性，裝甲等。</p>

<h3>糧食問題與敎員待遇</h3>
<p>— 燕北</p>
<p>自從本年端午左右公管理局另加手　費和運費布公定價格以來，北京的　食店幾乎是整個全體關郊外農民帶糧進城售買，市民才可以得到粉食。然而因為防疫的影響，糧食又漲了價，最近則隨着處疫的滅跡，開放城門，而又行跌價。華北當局總算是對於農民頗加愛護。在此秋收的時節，一般農民都以為政府要來全部收買，可是當局收買郊區糧倉的辦法却很緩。據本月十五日報上所載，此次收始辦理，計為玉米，黃豆一高粱等，計十一種，悉按公定價格收貢，不報勒案漁利，本市郊區產區每畝收買七公斤，計共收集二千二百三十噸，限一個月竣事。」一般的情形，一畝地可以收成五十公斤，當局只收買七公斤，則所餘尚多農民還可以自由售賣，而布民也還可以購到糧食。牧買的價格是每曰百公斤小米一百三十九元，玉米一百二十九元，高粱米一百零九元，穀子一百二五元。交納給食糧管理局另加手續費和運費二十元。</p>
<p>發行糧食庫劵</p>
<p>在糧食的對策方面，華北當局最近決定發行證劵，總額是二萬萬元，由十一月一口起發行。據報章所載，發行的辦法如下：　名稱及記號：中華民國三卞二年食糧證券「第一次」。　發行總額：。國幣（即聯鈔）二萬萬元。　發行及出售方法：由中國聯合準備銀行全數承受後，轉售各金融機關。　發行價格：照票面實足發行，並無折扣。　勞額種類：一千元，五千元，一萬元，十萬元，五十萬元五種。　發行日期：中華民國三十二年十月一日·　償還日期：一中華民國三十三年十二月一日。　償還方法：中華民國三十三年六月一日至少償還五千萬元，餘數於滿期日全部償還之。但民國三十三年六月一日償還部分以抽籤方法辦理或收一置之。　利率：年息四厘五毫。　付息日期：每年六月一日及十二月一日。　　第一次利息：中華長國三十二年十二月一日，照付每票四百元付三角七分。</p>
<p>敎職員補助金</p>
<p>北京中小學敎職員生活的困難，我們已經說過。釗然前些時候當局曾經對於所謂募集補助的辦法加以禁止，當而一般學校還是秘密的向學生微求補助，如每一學生每月應交糧食多少等等。這也是無可奈何的事。最近教育總署會擬了一個補救辦法，呈續政委會通過，就是請政委會每年撥給三百萬元補助費，其分配如下：河北省每元，北京市三十萬元，天津市八萬元，靑島市十一萬元。至於各省市自籌的補助費則依政委會補助之數作標準三分之二，計為六百萬元，其分配情形如下：河北省每年一百八十四萬元，山東省二百零八萬元，山西省七十八萬元，河南省三十二萬元，北京市六十萬元，天津市十六萬元，靑島市二十二萬元。這補助費每年分為四次發領，於一，四·七，十等月舉行之。此外對於學生的担負也有新的規定，「各中小學校除師範學校職業學校，簡易小學校，短期小學校外，在現在社會特殊情形之下，得暫准向學生徵收教職員生活臨時維持費，每學期每人中學校初級不得過十元，高級不得過十二元，小學校初級不得過四元，高級不得過六元，怛家境特別貧寒者，免予　收。」經過道次補助，中小學校教職員的生活總可以比較從前好一些了。</p>
<p>敎職員福利社</p>
<p>為着救　華北中小學教職員的生活，華北當局曾經通過議案，要由政委會　撥欵三百萬元作為救濟費，再由各省市自籌六百萬元，合計九百萬元，由各省市分配之。現在北京市商會會長邵泉　氏也出來特由急　會處提出十萬元，和北京市教育局合組一個北　市小學教職員福利社。委員長由教實局長孫世廈担任，而　衆蓀和急騙會各理事也担任了委員的職務。據報紙所載，這項十萬元之欵已經存入中國銀行，交通銀行，金城銀行，同德銀號，積生銀號等金融機關。如果北京市的小學職敎員遇有　　大故或其他急需時，他就可以向福利社請求借貨，不取分文利息，可以分期付還。這雖然不是重要的辦法，但對於一般小學　職員確是有其貢獻的地方。</p>
<p>補助費保管會</p>
<p>北京市敎育局於最近成立了一個「市立中小學職教員生活補助維持費保管委員會」。委員長由教育局長孫世慶兼任，另外並由中等教育科長，武毓寰，初等教育傳科長，及趙科長，學生家長魏子丹，朱溫苓，孔仲華，中學校長張景灣，羅遇唐，李直鈞，小學校長黃　，張　唐等任委員，第一次會已經於本月七日召開，研究補助維特費的分配辦法。（十一月十日）</p>

<h3>The Mission of the Newspaper Journalists' Conference</h3>
<p>The Third Greater East Asia Newspaper Journalists' Conference begins today in Tokyo. Following the recently concluded Greater East Asia Conference and the issuance of the epoch-making Greater East Asia Declaration, the convening of this Newspaper Journalists' Conference is, from the perspective of propagating the essential points of the Greater East Asia Declaration and arousing solidarity among all Asian peoples to strive for victory in the Greater East Asia War, an exceedingly important measure.</p>
<p>The outcome of modern warfare does not depend solely on military strength; other aspects such as politics, economy, and culture are all units of struggle. Therefore, modern warfare is a "total war." This understanding is already widespread and needs no detailed explanation. Propaganda is a branch of culture, and propaganda warfare is a crucial part of total war. The news profession is a major element of propaganda, so the power of the press in wartime is extremely important. This Newspaper Journalists' Conference holds an extremely important position in the significance of striving for victory in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>The joint declaration issued by the Greater East Asia Conference has already clearly indicated the common goal of all Asians. At the same time, we have a shared belief in the victory of the Greater East Asia War. Now that the goal has been set and the belief established, all that remains is to coordinate military, political, economic, and cultural efforts, each fulfilling its role and progressing step by step. Based on this view, we offer the following two points regarding the mission of this Greater East Asia Newspaper Journalists' Conference:</p>
<p>First, how to awaken the sense of responsibility of all Asian peoples? Victory in the Greater East Asia War is inseparable from the completion of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Whether the Co-Prosperity Sphere can be completed directly determines the future destiny of each Asian country and nation. Therefore, contributing all strength to the war is the responsibility of every Asian, and engaging in the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere is the obligation of every Asian. Neither responsibility can be shirked, nor obligation evaded. Moreover, this responsibility and obligation must be shared jointly in order to achieve practical results; it cannot be sustained solely by Japan's individual burden.</p>
<p>Second, how to introduce the general wartime situation in Japan? Japan initiated the Greater East Asia Doctrine and launched the Greater East Asia War, taking a leadership role. In the two years of war, it has achieved successive victories, in fact single-handedly defeating stubborn enemies. This is by no means accidental, but due to thorough preparation and solid strength. Therefore, the domestic situation and the wartime emotions of the people can serve as a model for the people of every Asian country. Upon arriving in Tokyo, delegates to the conference told Japanese reporters: "This is my third visit to Japan. What I have seen along the way is that Japan has no idle people and no wasted resources. Manpower and materials have all been mobilized. This is something we have not been able to achieve in China, and we feel ashamed. This is what we should emulate from Japan." To mobilize total strength and cooperate with the military, all Asian countries should take Japan as a model, ensuring that no one is idle and nothing is wasted.</p>
<p>We believe that these two points are not just empty opinions, but the most fundamental working principles. We hope that the representatives at the conference will exchange views on these principles and integrate them consistently. If this cannot be achieved, all moving proposals will inevitably fall flat.</p>
<p>Newspaper journalists are the vanguard of the era, the pioneers of action. With a single pen, they have the power to shake the world and awaken the deaf, and the ability to guide the people to righteousness. In wartime, they are the most powerful warriors, because they are the most suitable people to promote national policy and awaken the masses. Now that the Greater East Asia War has a common goal and common belief, we must each awaken the people's sense of responsibility, introduce the wartime situation in Japan, encourage the people to emulate it, strengthen the common belief, and advance towards the common goal together. We extend our sincere wishes to the participating delegates!</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Attack New Guinea, Bombing Various Military Targets; Enemy Boats Damaged Off the Coast of Finschhafen</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): According to a telegram from a certain Japanese military base in the South Pacific, Japanese naval volunteer units attacked the enemy airfield at Buna on the north coast of New Guinea Island before dawn on the 15th.

<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): A Japanese army air unit in the New Guinea area, on the morning of the 15th, jointly attacked the enemy airfield at Marilinan (20 kilometers from Lae) with fighter and bomber formations.

During this period, the U.S. forces have encountered fierce resistance from the Japanese army and are in dire straits. According to a telegram from New San Francisco, Lieutenant General Vandegrift, commander of the U.S. Marine Corps, also said that the intensity of the battle on Bougainville Island is no less than the operation on Guadalcanal, and warned his troops that it would be a mistake to think that the Japanese army could be easily defeated. Furthermore, a United Press war correspondent who landed with the troops on the 8th reported on the 13th as follows: The U.S. Marine Corps and Army troops who landed on Bougainville Island continue to fight hard in the worst conditions, not only encountering fierce resistance from the Japanese army everywhere, but also facing battle conditions and living conditions in the dense forest that are several times more difficult than on Guadalcanal. Heavy rains have fallen in recent days, turning the ground into mud, making it difficult for heavy vehicles to move. The vanguard of the Marine Corps has been fighting in the water for several days, and we are all living in caves every day.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): A message from a certain Japanese military base in the South Pacific reports that on the morning of the 15th, nine enemy Consolidated B-24 bombers attacked the Gilbert Islands. One aircraft was shot down by Japanese ground troops with anti-aircraft fire, and the other aircraft were heavily damaged and escaped. The Japanese side suffered minor damage.</p>

<h3>Mr. Tanaka and Mr. Tokutomi Express Their Thoughts</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): Tanaka Tokiochi, Chairman of the Japan Newspaper Association, and Tokutomi Iichiro, Chairman of the Japan Rhetoric Patriotic Association and Chairman of the Japan Literature Patriotic Association, expressed their thoughts on the Newspaper Conference as follows:</p>
<p>Tanaka Tokiochi: The Greater East Asia Newspaper Journalists' Conference is of great significance. The Greater East Asia region was filled with Anglo-American ideas due to Anglo-American propaganda, and the fundamental spirit of East Asia declined. However, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Anglo-American forces were completely expelled by military force. The remaining ideological dregs should be purged by our newspaper community to lay the ideological foundation for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This is an even greater glorious mission for our press. In this sense, the significance of this conference is profound. At the same time, I hope that similar conferences will be held frequently in the future so that Greater East Asia journalists can have more opportunities to interact and understand each other, and promote mutual cooperation.</p>
<p>Tokutomi Iichiro: The holding of the Greater East Asia Newspaper Journalists' Conference can be said to be most timely, so in addition to expressing the full enthusiasm of our rhetoricians, I would like to express my deep congratulations. The Greater East Asia Declaration on the 6th of this month is a guide for the survival of mankind throughout the ages and a charter for the establishment of world peace. The essence of Anglo-American imperialism is nothing more than invasion, plunder, fraud, and deception. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is a head-on blow to the Anglo-American commercial culture. The Greater East Asia Declaration is based on the ideology of "distinguishing between ancient and modern, distinguishing between China and foreign countries." It reveals that only in this way can the 1 billion Asian people obtain clarity, consolidate their self-awareness and values. The ultimate goal of this spirit is to establish world peace. All of Asia must be united by righteousness. The foundation for Asia's total uprising and general advance has now been established, and the practical program has been clearly revealed. It is now urgent to popularize the significance of this program. Those who bear this responsibility are the press, which guides public opinion. Therefore, the mission of the press is extremely important and great. The liberation of Asia can only be realized after the Anglo-American forces are driven out. Japan has risen up to wage war to destroy the Anglo-Americans who disregard morality and despise justice. The greatness of the Japanese army and the spirit of Japan's liberation of Asia have been fully demonstrated in reality. The defeat of the Anglo-Americans is already obvious. The autumn of Asia's total uprising has now arrived. We must gather all our strength to destroy the Anglo-American domination and their old order, and move forward to a new order based on morality. At this time, seeing the holding of the Greater East Asia Newspaper Journalists' Conference, we are overjoyed for the prosperity of Asia and the peace of the world.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Occupies Xin'an and Other Important Points; Chongqing Army on the Yuehan Railway Suffers Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): According to a telegram from a certain Japanese army front-line base in Central China, the Chongqing 73rd Army attempted to flank, so the Japanese army in Central China preemptively launched an offensive on the night of the 13th, and broke through the defense line connecting Youlili County and Zhoushi near Shimen. On the morning of the 14th, they occupied Xin'an, the location of the headquarters of the Chongqing 15th Division.

<h3>Cooperating to Build Greater East Asia, Sino-Japanese Relations Become Closer; Aoki and Shigemitsu Host a Banquet for Chairman Wang</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu jointly hosted a banquet at the Foreign Minister's official residence at 6:00 PM on the 16th to entertain Chairman Wang of the North China Political Affairs Committee of the National Government. Chinese Ambassador to Japan Cai and many important Japanese politicians were invited to attend. At the banquet, Minister Aoki and Chairman Wang delivered speeches. The atmosphere was lively, and the guests and hosts dispersed in joy until 10:00 PM.</p>
<p>Minister Aoki Delivers a Welcome Speech</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki and Foreign Minister Shigemitsu jointly hosted a banquet to entertain Chairman Wang on the 16th. Minister Aoki delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the hosts. The main points were: I am deeply impressed by Chairman Wang's assumption of office in North China at a time of serious situation. When I met you in Beijing, I was told of your determination to stabilize the livelihood of the people in North China and to promote the friendly relations between China and Japan, regardless of your personal safety. His grief is especially worthy of sympathy. I am confident that the reform of the structure of the North China Political Affairs Committee and the rejuvenation of political affairs will contribute greatly to the stability of North China and the construction of China. As Your Excellency said, Sino-Japanese relations have made epoch-making progress since the beginning of this year. The abolition of unequal treaties, which the 400 million Chinese people have been hoping for for a century, has been realized, and China's status has been elevated. Our two countries signed a treaty of alliance on October 30th, and Sino-Japanese relations have become clearer. The Greater East Asia Declaration recently clarified to China and foreign countries that China and Japan have decided to cooperate with other countries in the Co-Prosperity Sphere to build a Greater East Asia of common prosperity and contribution to the progress of the world. Looking back, China and Japan unfortunately fought each other because they were confused by Anglo-American conspiracies, but since the Anglo-American forces were driven out of East Asia, China and Japan have restored their original state. It is gratifying to develop the correct path that the two countries should follow and move forward together. North China is rich in various important resources. The development of these resources will not only benefit the development of industry and the improvement of people's livelihood in China and Japan, but also is closely related to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. When reforming the administrative structure of the Political Affairs Committee, Chairman Wang has strongly stated that North China, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, will strengthen its war power and exert its total power to complete the mission of the rear area, which is especially impressive to us. This time, the Commissioner visited the enemy country during the busy political affairs to hold frank talks with the key figures of the Japanese government in order to fully communicate his will. I hope that you will return home with a firm and unwavering determination to devote yourself to the construction of China and promote Sino-Japanese relations.</p>
<h3>Striving to Increase Production in North China to Achieve the Assigned Mission; Chairman Wang Delivers a Speech</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): Chairman Wang Kemin of the North China Political Affairs Committee of the National Government gave a speech to the Japanese readers at the Imperial Hotel here at 2:00 PM on the 16th. This is my fourth visit to your country. The reason for this visit is that I have been appointed as the head of North China, and I feel that North China occupies a very important position and bears a very important responsibility in the Greater East Asia War. In the future, all measures must request the support of your government. I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words after taking office, and at the same time, I would like to have frank talks and exchange ideas with the people of your country. I remember the first time I came to your country was in 1903, and soon after the Russo-Japanese War began. At that time, I saw the spirit of total mobilization of the entire country, so I defeated Russia. This time, I came to your country and saw that the people of your country, under the decisive battle system, are able to deeply understand the true meaning of the war, discern the direction of national policy, and dedicate themselves to their respective fields with a spirit of service, showing a tense and progressive emotion, which is even greater than the spirit of the Russo-Japanese War. Based on this point, we firmly believe that your country will be able to unite the countries of East Asia to assume the responsibility of reviving Asia, and will be able to defeat the Anglo-Americans, liberate East Asia, and achieve final victory. Since the Russo-Japanese War, I have advocated cooperation between China and Japan. The facts tell us that the spirit of Japan's policy towards China has always been consistent, and that is the spirit of East Asian morality. From the statement of Prime Minister Konoe to the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, this spirit has always been adhered to. This point is well understood by the Chinese people. Especially on January 9th of this year, when our government joined the war, China and Japan signed an agreement to return concessions and abolish extraterritoriality. Japan's promise to the Chinese government is being gradually implemented one by one. All these facts increase the Chinese people's trust in Japan and strengthen the relationship of cooperation between the two countries. The conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty on October 30th opened a new era in East Asian diplomacy. Due to the formation of this alliance, not only has the relationship between China and Japan reached a new level, but China has also had a solid foundation for revival. At the same time, Japan, in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, has also gained an independent and autonomous ally. Since Myanmar and the Philippines gained independence with the support of Japan, and India has also established a provisional government, the great unity of the East Asian nations has been completed. North China is the base of the Greater East Asia War, and its mission is extremely important. Therefore, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it has been strengthening the decisive battle system. In terms of politics, the most important thing is to eliminate corruption and implement honest politics in order to establish a new political system. In terms of economy, the biggest problem is to increase production and develop resources in order to complete the mission of the production base. At present, the increase in production in North China is gradually improving. The government is deliberating on the times and formulating various policies to gradually implement them. The people are able to understand the government's intentions and express their cooperation. Officials and people are working together to move forward, so the future of increasing production in North China is optimistic. North China is not only a production base, but also occupies a major position in the defense of communism in Greater East Asia. This position is even more important, so defeating the communists and ensuring security is the most important task in North China. This time, I have taken on the important task of North China, and I deeply feel the importance of the responsibility that China and Japan bear to Greater East Asia. I hope that the people in the most national parties will always give guidance.</p>

<p>Chairman Wang's Address</p>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - The original text of Chairman Wang's speech at the first National Health Administration Conference: Since the National Government established its capital, this is the first National Health Administration Conference to be held. Many health administration officials and experts have come to participate, which is truly a matter of great hope and gratification.</p>
<p>I plan to say a few words about the overall situation first, and then offer some opinions on health administration.</p>
<p>First, regarding the overall situation, the country's future is very bright, but the people's suffering is still very deep. Why do I say that the country's future is bright? The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty has already been concluded. Besides the treaty, there is only one subsidiary agreement and one document. There are no other secret documents. The same goes for the Greater East Asia Declaration. The countries of East Asia are independent and autonomous, coexisting and prospering, and jointly overthrowing the Anglo-Americans to restart the construction of ethical spirit. The country's future is undoubtedly bright. Why do I say that the people's suffering is still very deep? Overall peace has not yet been achieved, and the Greater East Asia War has not yet been completed. Some of the people's suffering is unavoidable, while some can be alleviated. For example, overall peace has not yet been restored, and the communist bandits are harassing everywhere, hindering production, and obstructing transportation, resulting in a daily decrease in rice production. At the same time, due to the war, transportation from Southeast Asia is difficult, and the import of rice has no fixed date or quantity. These are unavoidable sufferings. We can only muster the spirit of hard work and endure together. As for the control methods, they are not entirely appropriate; the administrative organization is not entirely reasonable; officials engage in corruption; and undisciplined troops commit disturbances. These should all be addressed with utmost care and corrected accordingly, in order to alleviate the suffering of the people. This is my simple report on the overall situation.</p>
<p>Regarding health administration, at the beginning of the return to the capital, the former Central Hospital was borrowed by friendly forces. Only one hospital under the Ministry of Interior was opened at the address of the Bank of China, and there were no beds. Many patients had to sit in rickshaws to go home, and some died on the way. The same was true for many pregnant women. It is truly heartbreaking to talk about it. In the three years since the return to the capital, there has been no foundation for finance, and many things that need to be done cannot be done. Fortunately, Mr. Wu Zeyuan donated several hundred thousand yuan, and with the government's planning, we barely managed to set up dozens of beds to accommodate seriously ill people, but it was still far from enough. Therefore, we had to build a new hospital. Nanjing has a population of nearly one million, and it is impossible to have no hospital. At that time, the government spent a lot of effort to plan and raise the construction and equipment costs. At the time, we felt that the cost was too high, but now we think that prices have increased more than dozens of times. After the hospital was built, we needed a group of doctors, such as President Li, who came from Hong Kong and supported it with great effort, and that is how it is today. However, this can only start from the city and cannot focus on the city while neglecting the countryside, especially not focus on the capital while neglecting the whole country. Therefore, the organization of the Health Administration Department followed. Fortunately, well-known doctors from Shanghai, such as the current Director Lu, came to take office. All of the above are the accumulation of bits and pieces over the past few years. I really feel sorry for the people, but during the Greater East Asia War, medical equipment and materials from Europe and the United States have almost disappeared. Enemy countries cannot come, and even friendly countries cannot come. So we can only rely on our ally, Japan. However, Japan is supporting the Greater East Asia War on its own. Not only is medical equipment difficult to obtain, but we cannot expect medical materials. Even many medical personnel have gone to serve as soldiers. Therefore, China's health administration must rely on itself. We must do our best to find solutions where there seems to be no solution. Of course, we are grateful for the assistance of our ally, Japan, but we cannot expect too much. Not only that, but we must also stand on the position of common victory and do our best to train medical personnel and collect medical materials, in order to contribute to the soldiers of the Greater East Asia War. (To be continued tomorrow)</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Construction Emphasizes Road Protection Work</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Construction previously organized a "Love the Railroad and Strengthen the Return" campaign and formed a railroad inspection team of 21 members, which departed on the 28th of last month. They returned to Beijing on the 3rd of this month, having inspected Dangtu County in Anhui Province, Xie Mountain County in Jiangsu Province, and Jiangning County in Zhejiang Province. Based on the conditions of the inspections along the way, Zhang Luan, Deputy Director of the Traffic Route Protection Work Committee of the Technical Supervision Department of the Ministry of Construction, has drafted a report. When the reporter met with Deputy Director Zhang yesterday to inquire about his impressions of the inspection, he replied that, in general, the results achieved along the way were very good. However, railroad protection is a difficult task, and it requires government agencies and the people who love the railroad to work together. Close contact with the military and allied forces is necessary to achieve effective results. It is necessary to promote propaganda to the people, so that the meaning of road protection is deeply rooted in the countryside and becomes a public virtue to be jointly observed. The welfare work of road protection team members must also be vigorously developed as an incentive. In short, previous efforts have yielded considerable results, and we must continue to advance in this spirit to achieve the most important goal of road protection.</p>
<h3>Adjustment of Sino-Japanese Joint Ventures to be Completed Soon; Reorganization of Silk and Salt Companies</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - Since the Incident, the important sectors of China's economic lifeline have been completely destroyed. Fortunately, the Allied authorities have been engaged in rectifying and striving to restore them. After the National Government returned to the capital, the important enterprises and companies were jointly operated by China and Japan in accordance with the spirit of economic cooperation. For three years, a foundation has been laid for China's economic recovery. Now, in order to promote the leap forward of China's economic construction and to share the burden of the common construction of Greater East Asia, our ally Japan is further adjusting the original joint ventures to strengthen the economic foundation of the National Government. This matter has become more active after the signing of the Sino-Japanese Treaty. Relevant personnel from both sides are currently carefully discussing the adjustment plan. The first phase of the adjustment will be implemented first, including the Huazhong Silk and Huazhong Salt Companies, which were officially announced on the 30th of last month to be abolished and reorganized. It is learned that the agreement on the other joint ventures will also be completed before the end of this month, and the adjustment will be fully implemented soon. The situation of the National Government's economic construction in the future will be further developed as a result of the adjustment of these joint ventures.</p>
<h3>Soldiers of the Chongqing Army Have Lost All Will to Fight</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 16th (Central News Agency) - Yan Haiqing (31 years old, Hubei), a intelligence team member of the newly formed 33rd Division of the Chongqing Army, and Cao Xiang (28 years old, Sichuan), the first group leader of the intelligence team of the Second Army, were captured by the Japanese army on the border between India and Burma on October 6. They described the loss of fighting will in the Chongqing army, stating that the First Company of the First Battalion of the 27th Regiment of the 9th Division of the Chongqing Army was completely wiped out by the Japanese army in the Jingqiangpa area (9 kilometers east of Gunlong) in the Wa City area on June 25 of this year. Therefore, the soldiers of the New 33rd Division deeply realized that the Japanese army was extremely strong and had lost all will to fight. Their fighting was only forced by the orders of their superiors, and military discipline was also extremely chaotic. For example, in late August, the company commander of the 8th Company of the 97th Regiment of the New 33rd Division, stationed in Gengma, was involved in a conflict with the platoon leaders due to deducting military pay. The first platoon leader even led 80 soldiers to desert. Also, due to dissatisfaction with military pay, no fewer than five or six soldiers deserted from each battalion every day. In addition, acts of looting residents' food, clothing, and metal products by the army were also endless. At the same time, due to the prevalence of infectious diseases such as malaria, pneumonia, and dysentery, each battalion had only one military doctor, and their medical skills were very rudimentary and medicines were lacking, making prevention extremely difficult. On average, 12 people died from malaria each month in each battalion.</p>
<h3>The Thai Defense Minister Has Been Decided</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Thai Minister of Defense has been concurrently held by Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram. The Thai government announced on the 15th that it had decided to appoint Lieutenant General Pei Jid, the current Deputy Supreme Commander of the National Defense Forces, as the full-time Minister of Defense, and also promoted Narong to the position of Deputy Minister.</p>
<h3>New Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to London news, Buckingham Palace announced today that the Duke of Gloucester has been appointed as the Governor-General of Australia, succeeding Lord Gowrie. Gowrie, who is 71 years old, has served as the Governor-General of Australia for seven years, the longest term of any previous Governor-General. The exact date of departure for the new Governor-General has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Egyptian King Injured in Car Accident</h3>
<p>Ankara, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to the Havas News Agency, Cairo officials announced that King Farouk I of Egypt was injured in a car accident yesterday. Whether his injuries are serious has not been announced.</p>
<h3>German Counteroffensive on the Zhitomir Front; Soviet Wedge-Shaped Advance Halted</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to the Havas News Agency, although the large-scale Soviet offensive west of Kiev achieved considerable success, and after street fighting, the German army withdrew from Zhitomir, there was little progress in the direction of Korosten northwest of Kiev. The advance toward Sekov was blocked by the German army's defensive positions. When the troops of Soviet General Vatutin advanced toward Zhitomir last month, their recessed flanks were severely attacked by the German army. The Soviet army is now trying to expand its wedge-shaped position, that is, to separate the north and south of Zhitomir, and is currently engaged in fierce battles with the German army. The enemy army is now attacking the east bank of the Dnieper River with ten infantry divisions and two tank regiments. However, there have been no surprise attacks so far, and only a superior number of troops have occupied some land north of Krivoy Rog, and have been blocked by the German counteroffensive. There are only local battles in the Perekop Isthmus, and the enemy offensive on the Kerch Peninsula has not weakened at all, but there is little progress. On the Smolensk-Minsk highway and in the Orsha area, the enemy army has stepped up its pressure. The concentration of large enemy forces in this area shows that the enemy's reserves have not yet been exhausted.</p>
<h3>Celebration Meeting of the Indian Independence League Branch in Berlin</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - The European branch of the Indian Independence League held a celebration meeting here on the afternoon of the 15th to celebrate the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India. Hundreds of people attended, including Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima, German Deputy Foreign Minister von Puhl, and representatives from the Axis countries, as well as representatives of soldiers from the Indian Independence Army formed under the German Defense Forces, totaling approximately 500 people. Nabi Ar, the European representative of the Indian Independence League, explained the process of establishing the provisional government, and then said that the Indian independence movement has reached a decisive stage on October 21, 1943, and it is certain that this movement will ultimately achieve complete success. British rule in India has never considered the interests of the Indian people, and millions of Indians have starved to death in provinces such as Bengal. This is proof of the tyranny of the British. Today, the Indian people are convinced that they must engage in actual combat in order to achieve independence. Chandra Bose is a fighter with all the necessary conditions to guide the Indian people in their fight. Finally, the meeting ended with congratulatory messages from German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, Propaganda Minister Goebbels, and the Italian Ambassador.</p>
<h3>The Famine in India Remains Serious</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to an official report from Mumbai, the number of Indians who have starved to death in the Calcutta area has reached 37,800. The famine there is still very serious, and it is expected that more people will die.</p>
<h3>Returning Japanese Residents Discuss American Secrets</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Asami, the former chief writer of the Japanese Shiji News in Hawaii, returned to Japan on the Japanese-American exchange ship Teia Maru. He revealed some of what he saw in the detention center in the United States: The American newspapers' reports on the war situation are extremely absurd. Every day, the front page is filled with false news of victory to prepare for war. The US Wartime Information Bureau adopted this propaganda policy to suppress the anti-war sentiment of the people. However, what is ridiculous is that although the front page of the newspaper is filled with false propaganda about victory, the commentary column on the fourth or fifth page often publishes announcements from the Japanese headquarters to negate the actual situation announced by the United States. American newspapers also widely publish news from Tokyo broadcasts, and announcements from the Japanese headquarters are often published in the "War Situation Announcement Column" of various belligerent countries every one or two days. However, recently, it is not known whether it is due to a change in the policy of the Information Bureau, but the announcements from the Japanese headquarters are no longer easily published. This proves that the American people have begun to distrust the announcements of the American government and deeply feel that the announcements of the Japanese headquarters are correct. Because the shortwave broadcasts from Japan have a very good reputation, many American families listen to Japanese broadcasts. According to what is seen in American newspapers, it has recently gradually emphasized that Japan is a strong enemy, and from time to time warns that the United States is fighting a terrible strong enemy like Japan for the first time since its founding. If it cannot be strengthened and defeated in battle, it is in danger of perishing.</p>
<h3>Special Edition on Great Victory</h3>
<p>How to Welcome the Great Victory</p>
<p>The great victory has finally arrived. After a year of hard fighting in the South Seas, without much fanfare, our people's hearts were hanging in the balance. However, in recent days, the soldiers on the front line have worked tirelessly and the results have been realized. At sea and in the air, they have broken the enemy's attack. With this great victory constantly ringing in our ears, the General Headquarters has announced that this is the first great victory since the Battle of Hawaii. Our joy and emotion are beyond description.</p>
<p>The Enemy's Embarrassment</p>
<p>Having recovered the Solomon Islands, will the enemy be willing to accept defeat so easily? But they are not so foolish as to be unaware of the strength of the Japanese army. The enemy's strong assault operations in recent days, launched in an attempt to satisfy their ambitions, demonstrate how anxious the enemy is to wage a short-term war. They realized that they would have to pay a considerable price, but they dared to attack. But what was the result? Three battleships sunk, one heavily damaged, two cruisers sunk, and three or more heavy cruisers heavily damaged, resulting in a disastrous record. The enemy soldiers who were stunned by the defeat, and the enemy country's leaders who received the defeat report, their panicked faces are as if they are in front of us. Such should be the fate of those who attempt to invade the Divine Land.</p>
<p>Our Alertness</p>
<p>But when we hear about this great victory, we are not merely overjoyed. What first touches the hearts of our people is that this great victory ultimately relies on the Emperor's majesty, and how we should repay His Majesty's grace. Secondly, it is the spirit of the Imperial Navy's Air Force to die for the country and be loyal to the Emperor in creating this great victory. Such a great victory was achieved solely by the power of the air force, leaving us in awe. According to the announcement, our losses were 15 aircraft that did not return after self-destruction. In response to this, we cannot help but straighten our posture in solemnity. Our brave naval forces, chasing after the defeated and fleeing enemy fleet and transport convoys, spared no effort in pursuit, even at the risk of becoming floating corpses after running out of fuel. Japan's long-standing glory is built on the foundation of this spirit of sacrificing one's life. Our gratitude is beyond words.</p>
<p>Strengthening Combat Power</p>
<p>This great victory will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the war situation in the South in the future. The enemy will have to re-examine its previous strategies. At that time, how will the American leaders deceive their people, who do not know the purpose of the war? It will be even more difficult in the future! But the enemy will not give up and will continue to counterattack. Win without arrogance! We must not be complacent about this victory. The enemy is quite determined to carry out a short-term war. What the people in the rear should do today is to further strengthen the war readiness posture, and the 100 million people should join hands and move forward together. Strengthening combat power is the most important thing. We must not relax our tense mindset for even a moment. That awareness and unyielding effort is what we owe to the many heroic spirits who created this great victory. (Sho: Translated from the November 10th Western Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<p>German Reaction</p>
<p>Before the US fleet set out, MacArthur boasted at the Anti-Axis Forces Special Conference in the Southwest Pacific: "If the Japanese Navy comes, I will welcome them, and I will deal with them with all my might, including heavy bombing." US Navy Secretary Knox also said at a press conference: "The US Navy is ready to fight the Japanese Navy anytime, anywhere." But relying on the superiority of its aircraft in numbers, the enemy fleet, which was searching for the Japanese fleet while heading north, was eventually buried in the belly of the fish by the brave Japanese electric attack aircraft. The Japan Asahi Shimbun connected an international telephone line to Mamoru, Hondo, and the Enna correspondent from Rome to Berlin on the night of November 9 to inquire about the German reaction to this.</p>
<p>Question: When was the news of the Second Battle of Bougainville Island announced in Berlin?</p>
<p>Answer: It was broadcasted by wireless radio as a special announcement at around 9:00 this morning, which is around 5:00 PM Japanese time.</p>
<p>Question: Oh! Oh! A special announcement?</p>
<p>Answer: For the first Battle of Bougainville Island, when two US aircraft carriers were sunk, a special announcement was also used. Since this time there is such a great victory, of course it is the same.</p>
<p>Question: What is the reaction? The Germans are also very pleased, right?</p>
<p>Answer: The news of the annihilation of the US fleet in Bougainville was immediately broadcasted to the entire German nation by wireless radio. The whole country is also boiling over with this victory. It is not unreasonable to be happy to see the victory of our ally Japan at a time when fierce battles are continuing on the Eastern Front. Because the enemy we defeated is a common enemy of Japan and Germany! Three days ago, when we heard about the great victory of sinking two US aircraft carriers and four cruisers, the German people were already very surprised. Now, having received the news of this great victory, they are even more amazed at the greatness of the Japanese Navy. And what particularly moves the German people is that this victory was achieved by the naval air force, which was numerically smaller than the enemy's. The spirit of being willing to sacrifice oneself and attack enemy ships with a fish spear is a symbol of the Yamato soul, and there is a new understanding now. Not only that, but every citizen has ignited a strong fighting spirit, is convinced of the final victory, and has deepened their trust in Japan.</p>
<p>Question: What do military experts think?</p>
<p>Answer: The evening newspaper has not yet been published, so I have not seen the comments in the newspaper. Combining what I have heard from various sources, after this twice-over annihilation battle, the US Navy in the Southwest Pacific will disappear without a trace. The US side dispatched such a powerful fleet this time, which shows that the scale of their counteroffensive is very large. The Japanese naval air force's power. The US Navy knows this in great detail, but they dared to take this risk because the US was very anxious about the slow progress of the war since the invasion of Guadalcanal in August of last year. Recently, because they have prepared considerable military equipment, they are engaging in a large-scale counteroffensive. In response, the Japanese Navy has been gradually retreating in a planned manner, luring the enemy, but on the one hand, it is preparing meticulously, and when the opportunity arrives, it will inflict a heavy blow. That opportunity has come this time. The Japanese Navy's power, and the excellence of the Japanese Navy's operations, are clear to the whole world. Because of this disastrous defeat, the battlefield that the enemy had painstakingly managed in the Southwest Pacific since August of last year has become a bubble.

<h3>Slogans and Taglines for the Thrift Movement</h3>
<p>(1) General</p>
<p>Practice thrift to manage the home and revitalize the nation. Practice the New Citizen Movement by starting with thrift. Do not waste, do not be extravagant. Thrift is a good behavior that shows love for oneself, others, family, and country. Wastefulness is a harmful habit that harms oneself, others, family, and country. To demand East Asian liberation and national freedom, we must first practice thrift. People who are thrifty are respected by everyone. People who are wasteful are looked down upon by everyone. Saving resources is a good way to lower prices. People who waste resources are as hateful as hoarding profiteers. People who waste resources are enemies of the masses. The reason for high prices is hoarding and smuggling on the one hand, and waste and extravagance on the other. Reform bad social habits by starting with thrift.</p>
<h3>Mr. Wen Lanting's Talk on the Greater East Asia Declaration Expresses Three Points of Hope</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: After the Greater East Asia Conference issued a joint declaration, various sectors in this city expressed their joy and comfort. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited Mr. Wen Lanting, who was pleased to express his views, saying, "The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was just signed in Nanjing on October 30th, and the Greater East Asia Conference was held in Tokyo, Japan, successively on the 5th of this month. This historically significant conference not only has far-reaching significance for the development of various East Asian nations, but also makes a great contribution to world peace. The various East Asian nations have established an order of co-existence and co-prosperity through this conference, affirmed friendship between nations with a spirit of morality, and developed the economies of each nation through close cooperation with each other. All of us in the industrial and commercial economic circles should bravely advance during this wartime period, be able to overcome difficulties, cooperate to achieve victory in the war, and when the East Asian history unfolds a new page, we should especially recognize the goals and grasp reality. First, our country has always been known to the world for its vast land and abundant resources, and the reason why its economy has not been able to prosper and develop is actually due to the underdevelopment of science and technology. Therefore, in the future, the only thing we hope that other nations will assist us with is science and technology. Second, during this wartime period, people's lives are extremely difficult. Saving material resources to contribute to the country is the duty that the people should fulfill. However, improving people's livelihoods and developing the national economy are especially urgent. The stability of people's livelihoods is indeed an important key to winning victory. It is hoped that the heads of state and representatives attending the conference will pay close attention to this and work together to seek a fundamental solution with collective strength. Finally, the backwardness of production in our country is indeed caused by the underdevelopment of science and technology, but the inability to concentrate capital for investment in active production is also a major reason. The industrial and commercial circles should cater to the needs of the current historical period, launch various production enterprises, contribute to the country, contribute to East Asia, and even contribute to the world. Only in this way can the responsibility of the industrial and commercial circles be fulfilled."</p>
<h3>Appointing District Map Officers in Municipal Areas, Formulating Provisional Regulations, Map Officers Should Serve as Witnesses for Land Transactions</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: In order to reorganize land taxes in the old municipal areas, the Finance Bureau has established a Municipal Area Land Tax Collection Office and sub-offices in each district. The land registry directors appointed by the Land Administration Bureau will also serve as map officers of the Finance Bureau to handle the collection of land taxes in order to be proficient. Provisional regulations for appointing district map officers have been drafted and approved, and the Municipal Area Land Tax Collection Office is now actively promoting it. To prevent concealment, one map officer will be appointed for each map, appointed by the Finance Bureau in accordance with the provisions of these provisional regulations. Citizens who are familiar with the local situation should issue an application, and after the Municipal Area Land Tax Collection Office investigates and confirms, they will report to the Finance Bureau for appointment and issue an appointment order. The map officer is responsible for supervising and urging the households in their respective maps to pay off the outstanding land taxes within the time limit. If overdue, the map officer should issue a report on the defaulting households and submit it to the Municipal Area Land Tax Collection Office for verification. If an area has been designated for land registration maps and the Land Administration Bureau of the Shanghai Special Municipality has already appointed land registry directors for each map, the Finance Bureau will immediately appoint the land registry director as the map officer to be proficient. When land is sold and ownership is transferred, the map officer should be a witness on the contract, and must check before the contract is signed whether the owner has paid off the land tax in order to strengthen our administration. If there is no land tax receipt, the owner should be ordered to first pay off the annual land tax to the Land Tax Collection Office before the contract can be signed. If citizens conceal land or do not have a land tax receipt and transfer ownership of the land, and there is intentional tax evasion, the map officer should report to the Municipal Area Land Tax Collection Office and request the Finance Bureau to investigate and handle the matter strictly. When the map officer is entrusted to handle certification, they may charge a handling fee. In areas where land registration circles have been designated, the amount determined by the Land Administration Bureau will be the standard, and other circles will be determined separately. For land with complete property rights for which the owner has a land tax receipt and is legally sold, if the circle citizen reports it, and there is a sales certificate, it should be amended at any time. These provisional regulations will be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Economic Health</h3>
<p>In a recent Sunday commentary in this newspaper, Mr. Higashida Toyojiro published an article on health, suggesting that the enemy-owned Hardoon Garden, the property of Jewish tycoon Silas Hardoon, in the concession area be opened as a park for the residents of Shanghai to relax and improve their health. This is a suggestion that every citizen would welcome.</p>
<p>Originally, in this time of war, the problem of increasing production is becoming increasingly serious. All private gardens should be leased out as much as possible and turned into public farms to alleviate the fear of food shortages. Hardoon Garden is enemy property, covering more than two hundred acres, and should have been turned into a garden long ago to be put to practical use. Now, Mr. Higashida advocates opening it as a park for the public to take refuge and rest. Its contribution to society may not be less than that of a garden, because while the public's need for food and vegetables is very urgent, the need for fresh air and proper recreation is also essential. Without fresh air and proper recreation to nourish them, people will not have good health; without good health, they will not have the capacity to produce. Therefore, we fully support Mr. Higashida's suggestion.</p>
<p>However, in addition to Hardoon Garden, there is also a large open space, which is also enemy property, and its location is even more suitable than Hardoon Garden, and its area is even larger than Hardoon Garden. Why not convert it into a park for the public to play? This large open space is the racecourse that all citizens of Shanghai are familiar with. Among the major cities in the world, Shanghai probably has the smallest average area of parks! The Shanghai authorities should take Mr. Higashida's suggestion as the core and open Hardoon Garden and the racecourse. Furthermore, they should carry out the cultivation of barren land in the suburbs of Shanghai, following the example of the Russian capital, and turn it into a public farm. In this way, the public will have more places for proper recreation, which can save many unnecessary expenses invisibly, and it can also provide considerable assistance in the production of food and vegetables. It can be said that the health of the citizens' bodies can promote the economic health of the city.</p>
<h3>Silver Union Association and Qianku Regulate the Financial Market; Strictly Limit Loans to Various Industries</h3>
<p>In order to prevent speculation, hoarding, and manipulation, the Joint Reserve Committee of Banks and the Joint Reserve Treasury of the Qian Industry are implementing a tightening of interbank lending. Banks have had to be particularly cautious about lending to various industries, which has already had an effect. The entire market has tended to stabilize. It is reported that the Silver Union Association allows member banks to provide property as collateral for business needs</p>
<p>Applications for borrowing shall be handled in accordance with the new borrowing methods. However, borrowing by Qian shops shall be handled by the Qianku, with a total amount limited to 50 million yuan. Therefore, all banks and shops can cope with it easily after the Silver Union Association adjusts it. As for various industries that need loans for legitimate purposes, such as developing production businesses and purchasing agricultural product raw materials, they can contact the banks and shops for loans in accordance with the new loan methods formulated by the two associations of the Silver and Qian industries, the restricted loan methods promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, and the banks and shops.</p>
<p>After the application is reviewed and qualified, the loan will be granted. The interest rate will be negotiated at any time with reference to market conditions. Therefore, although the money supply in the current market is tighter than before, the entire financial situation remains stable as always in order to curb the good phenomenon of preventing speculation and hoarding.</p>
<h3>Securities Exchange Cracks Down on Off-Market Transactions</h3>
<p>Since the Hua Commercial Securities Exchange opened on the 8th of this month, the telephone company has been rushing to install the telephones for the market's trading floor, and all the installations are about to be completed.

Regarding the commission for buying and selling, brokers charge 5 per mille to both buyers and sellers. However, sellers are also charged a transaction tax of 6 per ten thousandths. The exchange charges brokers 1.25 per mille. It will be opened for trial operation to see the results, and the settlement period for spot transactions may be changed to once a week. At the same time, in order to prevent speculation and manipulation of market prices, off-market unofficial transactions will be resolutely cracked down on. No brokers who are not approved by the exchange are allowed to buy and sell Hua shares on behalf of customers. The business licenses issued by the Exchange for operating Hua shares will be cancelled uniformly in order to prevent malpractices and unify responsibilities.</p>

<h3>The Truth about the British and American Air Forces stationed in India</h3>
<p>— Osawa Kanzo</p>
<p>For reconnaissance aircraft, the United States uses North American B-25, Lockheed P-38, Vought-Sikorsky P4U-1, and Curtiss P-40. The British have a squadron of Spitfire reconnaissance aircraft.</p>
<p>Except for the B-25, the rest are fighters that the enemy used to [omitted] themselves. They are used for short-range high-[omitted]. Among them, the P-38 [omitted] has a high [omitted] of [omitted] power [omitted]. It can be used in gold [omitted] to observe above 7,000 meters [omitted]. [omitted] First defeat, so change to use traditional values [omitted].</p>
<p>In addition, the US Air Force stationed near Kunming is also the opponent of the Army Air Force of the Japanese stationed in Burma. There are about 90 fighters and about 40 bombers, totaling about 130 aircraft, which often carry out guerrilla activities in Upper Burma. The American fighter squadron in this area is [omitted] those who survived the air battles. In the air battles, especially in the bombing, but they were all repelled by the Japanese fighter squadron.</p>
<p>The United States also uses air transport from India to [omitted] bases on the Japanese mainland in China, transporting B-24 and other bombers, and also transporting Chongguang troops to India to defend India. Among the 46,200 newly organized 30th Division transported by air transport, 27,770 have already arrived (including 2,950 officers). Recently, an average of 60 B-24s [omitted] the Yang [omitted] Qingzhong [omitted], which is [omitted] one-tenth of the Chinese, or only six.</p>
<p>The British and American Air Forces stationed in China have 11 Indian air force squadrons [omitted]. According to [omitted], their internal affairs are quite disharmonious and the problems are [omitted] complicated. However, we must pay close attention to the bomber squadrons of the American Air Force.</p>
<p>Judging from the prisoners of these bomber squadrons, they only have about ten months of practice and training [omitted] They cross the Atlantic Ocean, pass through Africa, and reach the front line. The real flying time is only about six [omitted] hours. That is, they are transported to India by bombing planes. Their training is accelerated, and bombers, which are different from fighters, simply drop the bombs they carry to complete their mission. Their understanding can only know the practical things about how to operate [omitted]. But although the pilots are unreliable, if [omitted] form a large formation and fly, they can fly in the clouds for a considerable time [omitted] and they can also carry out night bombing. Here, we cannot but admit a certain degree of superiority in the enemy's aircraft materials. They specialize in [omitted] the simplicity, compactness, and armor of their aircraft materials.</p>
<p>In short, as mentioned above, the enemy's replenishment is becoming more and more active. On August 28, they dispatched about 50 aircraft to [omitted] attack. The day before, August 27, there were also about 40 aircraft to [omitted] Meikutara. Previously, each attack was always about 20 aircraft, but now it has increased by more than double. Since September 7, the number of attacks by the enemy has also increased, with 375 attacks and 1,608 sorties.</p>
<p>As the rainy season passes, [omitted] In the sky of Liangxiong, the enemy and we will start a great air bloody battle. How to annihilate their numerous bombers is the task that the Japanese Air Force should undertake. (End) (Sho: Translated from the November 7 issue of Weekly Asahi)</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence</p>
<h3>The Grain Problem and Teacher Salaries</h3>
<p>— Yanbei</p>
<p>Since the Public Administration Bureau implemented fixed prices, including handling fees and transportation costs, around the Dragon Boat Festival this year, grain shops in Beijing have almost entirely relied on farmers from the suburbs bringing grain into the city to sell, allowing citizens to obtain flour products. However, due to the impact of epidemic prevention, grain prices rose again. Recently, with the disappearance of the epidemic and the opening of the city gates, prices have begun to fall again. The North China authorities can be considered to have shown considerable care for the farmers. During this harvest season, farmers generally believed that the government would purchase all their grain, but the authorities' method of purchasing grain from suburban granaries has been very slow. According to a report on the 15th of this month, this purchase has just begun and includes eleven types of grain such as corn, soybeans, and sorghum, all purchased at official prices without coercion or profiteering. The purchase amount is seven kilograms per mu (unit of land) in the suburban production area of the city, totaling 2,230 tons, to be completed within one month. Generally, one mu of land can yield fifty kilograms, and the authorities only purchase seven kilograms, so the remaining amount can still be sold freely by the farmers, and the citizens can still purchase grain. The purchase prices are 139 yuan per hundred kilograms of millet, 129 yuan for corn, 109 yuan for sorghum, and 125 yuan for grain. The Grain Administration Bureau charges an additional handling fee and transportation cost of 20 yuan.</p>
<p>Issuing Grain Coupons</p>
<p>Regarding grain countermeasures, the North China authorities recently decided to issue coupons with a total value of 200 million yuan, starting from November 1st. According to the newspapers, the issuance method is as follows: Name and Symbol: Food Coupon of the Republic of China, Year 32, “First Issuance”. Total Issuance: National Currency (i.e., Joint Reserve Notes) 200 million yuan. Issuance and Sale Method: The China United Reserve Bank will fully underwrite and then resell to various financial institutions. Issue Price: Issued at face value, with no discount. Denominations: Five types: 1,000 yuan, 5,000 yuan, 10,000 yuan, 100,000 yuan, and 500,000 yuan. Issue Date: October 1, Republic of China Year 32. Redemption Date: December 1, Republic of China Year 33. Redemption Method: At least 50 million yuan will be redeemed by June 1, Republic of China Year 33, with the remaining amount fully redeemed on the maturity date. However, the redemption portion on June 1, Republic of China Year 33, will be handled by lottery or repurchase. Interest Rate: 4.5% per annum. Interest Payment Dates: June 1 and December 1 each year. First Interest Payment: December 1, Republic of China Year 32, paying 4 yuan and 37 cents per ticket.</p>
<p>Subsidies for Teachers and Staff</p>
<p>We have already discussed the difficult living conditions of primary and secondary school teachers and staff in Beijing. Although the authorities previously prohibited so-called fundraising subsidies, schools still secretly solicit subsidies from students, such as requiring each student to hand over a certain amount of grain each month. This is also a helpless situation. Recently, the Education Administration Council drafted a remedy, which was submitted to the Political Affairs Committee for approval. It involves requesting the Political Affairs Committee to allocate 3 million yuan in subsidies each year, distributed as follows: Hebei Province 1 million yuan, Beijing 300,000 yuan, Tianjin 80,000 yuan, Qingdao 110,000 yuan. As for the subsidies raised by each province and city, they should be two-thirds of the amount subsidized by the Political Affairs Committee, totaling 6 million yuan, distributed as follows: Hebei Province 1.84 million yuan annually, Shandong Province 2.08 million yuan, Shanxi Province 780,000 yuan, Henan Province 320,000 yuan, Beijing 600,000 yuan, Tianjin 160,000 yuan, Qingdao 220,000 yuan. These subsidies are distributed four times a year, in January, April, July, and October. In addition, there are new regulations regarding the burden on students: "Except for normal schools, vocational schools, simple primary schools, and short-term primary schools, all primary and secondary schools may temporarily collect a temporary living maintenance fee from students under the current special social circumstances. The fee should not exceed 10 yuan per semester for junior middle school students, 12 yuan for senior middle school students, 4 yuan for junior primary school students, and 6 yuan for senior primary school students. However, students from particularly poor families are exempt from collection." After this subsidy, the lives of primary and secondary school teachers and staff should be better than before.</p>
<p>Teachers and Staff Welfare Society</p>
<p>In order to relieve the livelihoods of primary and secondary school teachers and staff in North China, the North China authorities passed a proposal to allocate 3 million yuan from the Political Affairs Committee as relief funds, with an additional 6 million yuan raised by various provinces and cities, totaling 9 million yuan, to be distributed by each province and city. Now, Mr. Shao Quanyuan, Chairman of the Beijing Chamber of Commerce, has also come forward and specially proposed 100,000 yuan from the Emergency Relief Association to jointly establish the Beijing Primary School Teachers and Staff Welfare Society with the Beijing Education Bureau. The chairman of the committee is Sun Shixia, Director of the Education Bureau, and the directors of the Public Welfare Association and the Emergency Relief Association also serve as committee members. According to the newspapers, this sum of 100,000 yuan has been deposited in financial institutions such as the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, Jin Cheng Bank, Tong De Yin Hao, and Ji Sheng Yin Hao. If primary school teachers and staff in Beijing encounter major misfortunes or other urgent needs, they can apply to the Welfare Society for interest-free loans, which can be repaid in installments. Although this is not a major solution, it does make a contribution to general primary school staff.</p>
<p>Subsidy Management Committee</p>
<p>The Beijing Education Bureau recently established a "Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teacher and Staff Living Subsidy Maintenance Fee Management Committee." The chairman of the committee is concurrently held by Sun Shiqing, Director of the Education Bureau. In addition, the members include Wu Yuhuan, Chief of the Secondary Education Section; Zhao, Chief of the Elementary Education Section; Wei Zidan, Zhu Wenling, and Kong Zhonghua, parents of students; Zhang Jingwan, Luo Yutang, and Li Zhijun, principals of middle schools; Huang [blank], and Zhang [blank] Tang, principals of primary schools. The first meeting was held on the 7th of this month to study the distribution of the subsidy maintenance fee. (November 10th)</p>

<h3>Student Donations to Aid Orphans at the Relief and Education Home</h3>
<p>What do the Adults Think?</p>
<p>We are a group of children, so we pay close attention to and are interested in the news about children in the newspaper. We were very concerned when we saw the news about donations to the Shanghai Youyou Relief and Education Home in your newspaper. We also held a fundraising event for the Youyou Relief and Education Home, raising a total of 1,100 yuan in Central Reserve Notes over two weeks, which we are now enclosing for transfer to the Youyou Relief and Education Home. The amount we raised this time is small, but we have done our best. "Children saving children" - we are all young masters of the country! All students of the Private Qicheng Elementary School. (The money has been received on behalf of the school, and we hope that the accounting department of the school will prepare a receipt.)</p>
<h3>Shift Frivolous Spending to Donate to Winter Relief</h3>
<p>— Li Zhiyang</p>
<p>Yesterday, the writer went to the eighth floor of a certain large hotel to attend a temporary meeting of shareholders of a certain company. Four or five hundred shareholders attended, a bustling and prosperous occasion. Afterwards, the matters discussed were decided by voting. At this time, the hotel suddenly served tea and refreshments, and the entire meeting was announced to take a break for tea and refreshments, with the attendees told not to disperse so that the voting results could be reported to the public. However, as soon as the tea and refreshments were finished, the majority of the attendees left one after another, unable to vote in full, and not even waiting for the chairman to report the results. It seems that they came for the tea and refreshments, and were not concerned about the matters discussed. There were even women bringing children, making their purpose for attending even more obvious. If each guest costs 30 yuan, then this meeting must have cost no less than 10,000 yuan. If this money were shifted to help the famine, wouldn't it be beneficial?</p>
<h3>Seeking Children's Reading Material</h3>
<p>Our school currently has nearly two hundred impoverished students who cannot afford extracurricular reading materials. We hope that enthusiastic educators will donate their stored books, such as children's literature collections, literary journals, and various beneficial reading materials, wall charts, and maps, which are all welcome. A mimeograph machine is also needed. Please send letters to Fuguang Elementary School, No. 3 Sanpailou Road, Nanshi, addressed to Principal Hu Zhou.</p>
<h3>Ill-gotten Gains Transferred to Scholarship Fund</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 3rd, I took tram No. 4 from Taicang Road to return home. On the way on Rue Massenet, I encountered a pickpocket. I should have sent him to the authorities for investigation, but I was persuaded by bystanders to give him a warning and let it go. However, when I was arguing with the pickpocket, someone inadvertently learned my address. On the [blank] day, an anonymous person sent me 30 yuan in Central Reserve Notes, from which I knew that this matter was related to the pickpocket. I felt it was unjust to accept it, so I sent it to your office as a scholarship for impoverished students and have received a receipt. Zhen Dong Qi.</p>
<h3>A Poor and Sick Woman Waiting to Die</h3>
<p>There is a friend named Miss Hu Xiuzhen, who is physically weak. She previously suffered from pleurisy. When she was ill, her father passed away, which stimulated her even more. Her family situation has always been very poor. Now she has a mother, a younger brother, and a younger sister. Miss Hu has unknowingly shouldered the economic burden alone. However, Miss Hu's condition has recently worsened, and she has developed early-stage tuberculosis. She has borrowed more than 10,000 yuan to treat her illness. In fact, Miss Hu can no longer increase this burden and can only wait to die. However, the tragic situation of her family can be foreseen if Miss Hu dies. For the sake of several lives, we have no choice but to appeal to the public for assistance, either by introducing her to a free hospital or donating medical expenses, which would be a great act of merit. Miss Hu currently resides at No. 167 Beihang Xinxinli, the end of Rue du Père Froc, District 8. Interested individuals can go there to investigate.</p>
<h3>Shandong Native Association Seeking Members</h3>
<p>The first membership drive of the Shandong Native Association of Shanghai on Ximen Road is scheduled for the grand unveiling on the 21st. Under the initiative of honorary director Su Chengde, the work of expanding membership is actively underway. In addition to inviting celebrities such as Wen Yiduo, Ting Lin, and Kang Hou to give speeches, there will also be magic shows, music performances, and Peking opera rehearsals, as well as other entertainment.</p>
<h3>Report on Donations of Winter Clothing</h3>
<p>Yesterday, we received a donation of 500 yuan in National Currency from Mr. Lin Chengsheng, saved from celebrating his 60th birthday, and 100 yuan from young Guo Yuecheng, as well as 20 yuan from Miss Sun Xuesi, all of which have been received and are hereby acknowledged.</p>
