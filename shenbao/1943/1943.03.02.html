<p>社評</p>
<h3>提高行政效率問題</h3>
<p>國府參戰以來，戰時體制諸設施，已開始全面的進展，舉凡政治，軍事，經濟，教育，莫不開始活躍。然而一切政策與實施辦法，其間尚有相當距離，所有提高行政效率問題，便爲當前最重要的課題。</p>
<p>提高行政效率的最基本條件，我們始終認爲必須改善用人行政，貫澈人才主義，政府必須大量的吸收全國各方面真正的人才，各級政治機構中的用人行政，一定要實行「適時」，「適地」，「適才」的用人政策，然後才能使政府一切良善的政策，切實執行。不過，既要實行人才主義，首先必須澈底打破過去用人的同鄉主義，親族主義，和宗派主義，如果不首先打破過去用人唯私的習氣，那麼要求真正的人才，是不可能的。現代國家中最健全的政府都有重用在野黨派與無黨無派的度量和魄力，尤其在戰時，必須絕對採用人才主義，汲引在野黨派和無黨無派中的優秀分子共同努力，這樣，才能強化政府本身的力量。</p>
<p>譬如一月間設置的全國經濟委員會，原來是參戰後具有第一重要意義的機構，第一次任命的委員已有二十餘人之多，而全體會議三個月才舉行一次。後來又繼續添加新委員十餘人，本來人才集中，是最可喜的現象，但如果隨意添派人員，而所增加的又非盡爲專家，那麽一方面不能得到公論的曲諒，而使人民重視這一新的經濟機構。另一方面亦足以影響諸委員的責任心。在提高行政效率上講，這不過隨便舉出一個例子。我們認爲任何政治機構，用人必須有確定的方針與人才標準，尤其在戰時決不能隨便派一個人，安揷到一個不適當的機構去。</p>

<h3>日本陸海軍精銳進駐廣州灣</h3>
<p>日本陸海軍精銳部隊，取得法國政府之完全諒解，在二月二十一日進駐廣州灣的法國租借地，打破了敵方的蠢動意圖，由此，可以進一步加强日本的不敗戰勢。</p>
<p>連結馬來，爪哇，婆羅洲，新幾內亞一帶的大東亞圈外圍屛障，益見鞏固，敵方如果再要從那一帶反攻，必然增多犧牲而。美方企圖利用中國大陸爲最有力的根據地，加强對日反攻，這是顯而易見的事實。羅斯福和宋美齡會見的時候，也强調這一點。在他們野心蠢動的時候，一定會不擇手段的蠻幹，這是有侵入法屬北非，攻取馬達加斯加等的先例可證，等到美國加強在中國的根據地的時候，不用說法國租借地廣州灣一定包括在內，就這一點來觀察，那末，日本軍的進駐廣州灣，可以說是先發制人的必要的手段。</p>
<p>確保了廣州灣一帶，在完成大東亞戰爭上是有何等重大的意義，相反的，要是被數方佔據了廣州灣，建築根據地，這對於我們的影響如何，祇要把這兩點反覆來比較一下，自然可以明白它的意義了。這一次進駐成功之後，我們的接濟綫是更加安全，對越南的防備，也可以鞏固，大東亞圈的內外屛障，可以鞏如磐石，固若金湯了。</p>
<p>另一方面對渝的威脅又加重了一層。自滇緬公路斷絕以來，廣州灣就成了援渝的最後一條路模，偷運種種物資，軍火，要是想到這一點，那麽這次日本軍進駐廣州灣後，重慶的外援路綫就完全斷絕，對於重慶的影響是何等深刻，他所受的打擊是何等嚴重。</p>
<p>蔣介石把對日抗戰分爲三個階段，第一個階段是防禦戰，第二個階段是準備反攻時期，第三個階段是總反攻時期，可是因爲華中日軍的新攻勢，渝蔣蒙受了重大打擊，這一次雷州半島又被完全控制，那末他所謂第三個階段恃英美爲後盾的總反攻時期，是絕對不會實現的了。（任雲鵬：譯自二月二十三日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>春季攻勢前奏　德蘇秣馬厲兵　準備一決雌雄　唐納資河鐵路中心　在戰略上勢所必爭</h3>
<p>蘇聯邊境某地一日哈瓦斯社電　德蘇兩軍刻正厲兵秣馬、一俟冰雪溶解之時期過去、即將恢復形勢、是以東綫戰局、現為運輸工具及後備兵兩大因素所支配、準此而論、吾人殆可謂冬季戰爭業已終了、目下所發生之戰爭、與其稱為冬季戰爭之延長、無寗謂此乃春季攻勢之前奏、東綫戰爭陷於停頓狀態、至少須歷三星期之久、惟德蘇兩軍總司令部均厲兵秣馬、準備發動一具有決定性質之戰爭、雙方均需要最佳之運輸制度、德軍集中在唐納資河鐵路中心克賴瑪托斯克與羅索伐亞兩城者、其故在此、紅軍　在今冬獲得重大勝利、但在運輸方面、德方仍較蘇聯為佳、軸心軍仍能控制大批鐵路、而在紅軍收復之領土內、所有鐵路及公路，均已被德車毀壞，惟紅軍擁用大批騎兵，可以彌補運輸困難之缺陷，加以紅軍刻正加緊努力，俾在收復區內恢復各種交通，至於後備兵問題，仍為第二次世界大戰現階段之一大啞謎，交戰國雙方總司令部今日所需要者，並非「砲彈」，而為訓練有素之人力，能駕駛飛機坦克車及大砲，以從事錯綜複雜之現代戰爭，</p>
<p>柏林一日同盟社電　東綫克賴瑪托斯克方面現亦正展開激戰，尤以　地西南蘇軍之攻勢相當激烈，德軍乃以戰車部隊及俯衝轟炸，猛襲蘇軍背後陣地，使蒙極大損害，現正向西方壓迫蘇軍，又卡科夫西方米沃斯河開區亦繼續熾烈之戰門，傳優勢之蘇軍曾於該地數處突破德軍陣地，然因該突破部隊與主力部隊之連絡被遮斷，反陷於孤立狀態，因被義軍猛烈攻擊，蒙受損害頗大，德軍又於唐納資盆地之伏羅希洛夫格勒西南方，似亦出以猛烈之反攻，路透社從軍記者之報道亦已確認此事實，並，「德軍以戰車及機械化部隊為主力之攻勢，其規模甚大」云，</p>
<p>安加拉一日海通社電　據此間得莫斯科補充息，蘇軍在唐納資盆地之防綫，被德軍突破數處，蘇軍遂被迫後退，在克拉瑪托斯克沲南作戰之德軍坦克車師已進而威脅該城，德軍在羅索伐亞亦有局部勝利，故全部局勢仍在混亂之中，關於羅斯托夫以西之局勢，莫斯科之消息中，謂德軍堅强之防務已被征服，</p>
<p>維希二十八日哈瓦斯社電　上週間蘇軍在東綫各路，不斷總攻，均被德軍一一擊退，唐納資區之蘇軍攻勢，亦為德軍所阻，損失慘重，米烏斯前綫亦有蘇軍一師被殲，週末德軍在克拉斯諾梅斯克及阿索夫海一帶，開始反攻，戰事激烈，據軍事觀察家談稱，蘇軍攻勢，業已喪失其重要性，蓋紅軍進攻之目標，亦已轉變，最近蘇軍攻勢，漸露荏弱之兆，德軍已在數處，重獲主動地位，尤以唐納資煤礦區為甚，德軍業已改守為攻，據柏林宣佈，德軍先鋒已　過克賴瑪托斯史及羅索育兩城，此外北路伊爾開湖區亦有劇戰，惟蘇軍迭次進攻，均經擊退，南路高加索方面蘇軍雖迫近諾伏洛西斯克港，但近郊德軍工事鞏固，蘇軍尚難進攻，羅斯托夫附近蘇軍亦無進展，故蘇軍統帥部或已決定放棄進攻泰幹洛格計劃，擬繞道進攻馬里波爾港，</p>
<h3>德在元首指導下確立決戰禮制　國民生活充滿戰時氣氛　將予今後戰局極大影響</h3>

<h3>歐洲近况與土耳其動向　對談</h3>
<p>— 朝日新聞社前田義德丸山政男之</p>
<p>中立國不如交戰國</p>
<p>丸山：我首先願領敎的是您對於最近戰火延燒中的歐洲印像。</p>
<p>前田：姑且拋開作戰中的英國不談，而最近歐洲益形惹人注目的，是中立國人民生活比交戰國更困窘。例如土耳其，第一次歐洲大戰時，雖然料幫助德國作戰，但當時每人每天口糧份為三百公分的麺包。然而這閃戰爭，雖然是置身戰爭漩渦外的中立國，每人每天最高口糧份却是二百五十公分。這即是說，益形惡化。再拿瑞士來看，現在即想帶出國外僅僅一條圍巾，也不可能，甚至海關都會沒收的。然而上次戰爭却不如此。葡萄牙全國內普遍盛行着一種商品的黑市；而在瑞典，酒類早已絕跡於人間。形勢旣如此，若從物價觀點來看，中立國的通貨膨脹，則遠甚於交戰國。</p>
<p>總之，此次戰爭漩渦內各交戰國，根據前次戰爭的經騐，這在發動戰爭前早已完成新的經濟體制，所以一日戰火燎原，也可以照原有經濟形式維持一個相當時期，這就是交戰國經濟情形反比中立國良好的理由。希臘的經濟狀况與國民生活，大槪在歐洲是最困難的。而中立國比交戰國益形惡化，這只是最近在歐洲才特別朗化的現象。</p>
<p>丸山：物價飛跌和黑市等情形如何？</p>
<p>前田：例如葡萄牙，從英國也有船隻人口，每天也有運輸飛機來往，倫敦出版的報紙，在第二天也可以看到。旣是這樣一個國家，戰前只不過兩三塊錢的威士忌酒，現在竟達二百餘元。其次關於汽油，雖然普遍實行着配給制度，然而出租汽車非以限價的三倍或四倍，是絕對買不至汽油的。作一套西裝，在戰前只不過六七十元，而現在即用三百元錢也作不到。</p>
<p>若從人民情緒觀點上看，也如此。交戰國人民因為具有非戰勝不可的決心，人民全在或多或少的程度上努力着。然而中立國人民，最初雖然漠不關心於勝利誰屬的問題，但現在已經瞭解不可能完全保持中立，所以每個人民都担心牽入作戰，即在這種人民情緒方面看，中立國也比交戰國更不安定。</p>
<p>例如土耳其，不是美國爾基來訪，就是德大使巴本歸國，不是蘇聯大使返國述職，就是邱吉爾求謁總統，不一而足的這類特殊神經戰，都使土耳其人民心理上起着起伏不定的波瀾。而表現於經濟方面，當然也有瞬息萬變的形勢。</p>
<p>丸山：此外，有什麽感想？即是瑣碎的小事，也請求知一二。</p>
<p>前田：用重女輕男，女尊男卑，這樣話來武穴歐洲尊敬女人的情形，也許很妥當，這類養尊處優的女性，竟大批參加生產，眞是一件非同小可的事。雷車上的售票員，多半都成了女人的天下，信差的工作，也差不多都成了女人的職業。</p>
<p>丸山：中立國當中最値得重視的，我認為是土耳其和西班牙。這兩國的動向，對整個戰爭前途，有極大的關係。因此，我很想領敎一下，關於土耳其和西班牙兩國最近的動向。</p>
<p>是立觀念因國而異</p>
<p>前田：當地情形，大體上與您所說的一樣，但西班牙與土耳其底觀念，少有不同。西班牙內戰結束以來，在佛郎哥底統率下，原則上，完全站在軸心方面。無論在思想在政策方面，全是如此。土耳其則不然。如果我們仔細看看此次戰爭與土耳其的立塲，則可以知道土耳其和西班牙一樣，都是盡可能避免捲入戰爭漩渦。在這一點上，二者是具有同樣的立塲。</p>
<p>西班牙尚未統一國內，這即是未達到參戰程度。曾經打擊共產主主政策的，雖然是佛郎哥領導下的革命，然而援助佛郎哥的，却是地主，敎徒，舊貴族，以及陸海軍的一部。若從西班牙的皇族方面看，這倒和英國非常接近。佛郎哥的長槍會黨，曾和保皇黨妥協而才能結束內戰。長槍會黨的制服曾是深靑色的衣帽，然而妥協後，則衣衫照舊為深靑色，而制帽却改為紅色，這就是採用了保皇黨底制帽。旣如此，很多支持佛郎哥者，一般說來，即使談不到親英，但也不想和英國作戰。却始终保持著友好關係。這就是目前微妙所在的地方。</p>
<p>一般說來，土耳其在第一次歐洲大戰時，曾是德國的同盟國，而與英國死拼過。以後着，凱木爾將軍領導下的革命，藉驅逐英希聯軍於國境之外，而得完成。按最近土耳其的輿論，特別是按英美在北非登陸，里比亞英軍底前進等，而與地中海有絕大關係的土耳其和西班牙和英車更進一步的接近。這一點就是土耳其和西班牙兩國現狀的不同點。</p>
<p>丸山：保持中立的願望雖然很明顯，但該國在世界大戰中佔有重大戰略地位，也許客觀形勢將逼迫其放棄中立態度。我總以為這種客觀形勢在逐漸迫近。</p>
<p>前田：我也認為這樣。</p>
<p>近東形勢大可重視</p>
<p>丸山：我認為土耳其的動向更為重要。關於這一點，最近英美兩巨頭在加蕯勃朗加會議。</p>
<p>假定土耳其取自由立塲則德國在東綫再開始春季攻勢時，就不必像以前那樣，從北高加索兵，再越峻峭天險的大高加索出脈，侵入南高加索，然後擴張勢力於近東，與其走這樣困難遙遠的路徑，倒莫如通過土耳其，以取得此次戰爭的目的—最低限度可以說，目的之一，即可得到供給地中海艦隊燃料的近東豐富油田，獲得經濟方面和地理方面的重要據點，控制英國根據地的近東，我以為這總比較容易…</p>
<p>前田：這樣說也可以，或許德國此次戰爭的最高理想，不只限於銾戰爭，不只限於建立歐洲新秩序，而正如日德義三國條約所規定的一樣，日本努力於東亞新秩序，德義積極歐洲新秩序，然後合而為一，進而確立世界新秩序的最高目標，想到這一點，土耳其應當早日決定態度，一經決定，則德國為建立新秩序而與日本駢肩作戰，就比較容易得多。</p>
<p>丸山：這就是和上次大戰有最大的不同點。如估計到大東亞戰爭和歐洲戰爭的有機結合這種世界規模時，就可以瞭解前此戰爭意義的不同。此外，戰爭底路綫與作戰的方向，也與上次大戰不同。從這一意義上看，我認為近東非常重要。</p>
<p>前田：這很對。還有近東的伊朗，伊拉克，沙地阿刺伯，克拉克，叙利亞，黎巴嫩，土耳其，埃及等地的宗敎，雖然源派很多，但大體上皆為回敎。且土耳其是擁有最後回敎敎主的國家。因回敎主在土耳其，所以如土耳加入軸心陣營，則起碼近東一帶的回敎徒都會傾向軸心國。回敎國中最大的一個國家，無論如何也得數土耳其。其次，便是埃及。克拉克因有麥加主敎關係，雖然要求繼水回敎主的權利，但按其國力來說，還不足掛齒。第一次歐洲大戰時，土耳其大軍也會深入過克拉克國土。</p>
<p>從這一點看，土耳其早日決定態度，對於德國建立世界新秩序一環之近東問題，也可以提前決定，在這種意義上，反而有樂觀的可能性。我認為也可以這樣說。</p>
<p>不能輕視外交內幕</p>
<p>丸山：土耳其與各國似乎有相當密切的經濟關係。大體上說，軸心國佔百分之四十，英美方面佔百分之六十…。</p>
<p>前田：在去年春天，軸心國幾乎佔據百分之八十。理由就是，羅美爾將軍攻入埃及時，英國商品幾乎斷絕。因此，便和德國，羅馬尼亞，保加利亞等國匆忙地締結新的商約。從這一事實看來，在某一時期，土耳其在經濟方面，和軸心國家有更高度的關係。</p>
<p>但有一件很有趣的事，美國頗有些孩稚氣，一發生什麽大問題，或不利問題時，總是丘吉爾和羅斯福會面商量商量，然而關於本國的外交工作，却不和英國談。這眞表現了充分的不合作。這也許是反映一個國家的歷史，因為美國還年靑，太性急。對於土耳其，史坦赫德也是這樣一個作風。因此，英國大使許閣森當然也不能坐失良機，去年底曾返國述職，我想這次一定又和丘吉爾一同返回任所。</p>
<p>丸山：請計一講威爾基訪問土耳其的一幕故事！</p>
<p>前田：去年秋天，威爾基訪問莫斯科和重慶，這是主要目的，然而到了埃及及開羅時，就托史坦赫德介紹，而才去土耳其的。所以在開羅招待新聞記者席上，曾說過下面一句話：「這次我替羅斯福給土耳其大總統伊斯美帶來一個口信」。一般說來，在信中就沒有口信。這不過是從華盛頓動身時，並沒有訪問土耳其計劃。</p>
<p>洞悉其奸的土耳其外交部，不僅發生了許多懷疑，甚且伊斯美大總統大怒而說，即使口信也好，如果帶來的是這樣一個口信，為什麽不直接在華盛頓吿訴土耳其駐美大使呢？何必因口信，威爾基僕僕風塵親自正式訪問土耳其，且又事前未行通知呢？旣如此，則不必見，蕯拉敎古內閣總理也沒有接見的必要。因此，就和蕯拉敎古總理同赴蘇聯國境綫去視察。然後吿訴外交部長，代為致意。威爾基照例乘着飛機，得意揚揚地在安加拉飛機塲着陸，但來迎接的只有外交部交際司秘書一人，以後誰也沒來。這種情形，當然令人憤懣。後經史坦赫德底勸說，費了九牛二虎之力，美奈門敎古外交部長和參謀部次長才給會面。然而，如果就這樣吿別，這不僅對威爾基個人的面子有關，而且也對整個美國的面子有關，所以史坦赫德約請外交部長午餐，藉便懇談。在土耳其，大家都以為是止於此，然而威爾基動身的前一天晚上十點鐘，蕯拉敎古總理才回到安加拉來，只談了一個半鐘頭的話，這種招待方法在表面上看，雖然有拍馬嫌疑，然而實際上，美國却被外交團和新聞記者們極盡冷嘲熱諷之能事。</p>
<p>丸山：那要按往常土耳其的外交季節來說，…</p>
<p>前田：因為是九月初，正是親軸心的時候，也正是將接近親英美的季節。</p>
<p>丸山：從各種觀點來看，佔領北非，尤其是近東，一直到印度的這一條綫，或許要起決定作用，而這一綫底主要關鍵，又在土耳其，所以土耳其也逐漸逼近決定最後態度的時候了，我們也要對於這個土耳其問題，應當善加處理。</p>

<h3>東印度滄桑記（二）</h3>
<p>— 喬松</p>
<p>中央政治分立內務，敎育宗敎，交通土木，財政，司法，經濟，陸軍，海軍八部，各設部長，除陸海二部長由國王任命外，餘由總督任命。地方行政分三省十九州，省設省長，州設州長及理事官，統治地方。</p>
<p>荷印評議院由國王仟命的副議長一名議員四至六名組成，就規定事項，供總督諮詢。但決定權則存於總督。而總督則在仟何期間省得當然議長。</p>
<p>（三）司法：總督於聽取高等法院院長的意見後，有賦予特赦的權限，對於承認土侯土酋裁判權的地方，也經荷印評議院，而賦與大赦或廢棄之權。</p>
<p>最高審判廳爲最高法院，地方審判廳有省區法院，理事州法庭，土人理事州法庭及縣法庭僧侶法庭等。</p>
<p>財政制度，經國民參議院通過，由總督決定，再經荷蘭議會承認而確定。</p>
<p>財政狀態，至第一次歐洲大戰止，沒有什麼嚴重的問題，大戰爆發，預算即呈膨脹，歲入不足額也有逐年增加之勢。一九二四年起，經多方努力，稍見好轉，至一九二九年世界經濟恐慌時再形惡化，一時財政危岌；近年以物價高漲。歲入增加，稍形樂觀，至第二次大戰前而又逆轉。一九三〇年以後之歲入歲出額如下（單位千盾）：</p>
<p>荷印國債額（千盾）</p>
<p>上列數字依據和田義隆所著「南洋之新知識」。</p>
<p>（三）富裕的資源</p>
<p>東印度雖然已有了幾百年的殖民地的痛苦命運，慘遭殖民地當局無情的剝削與掠奪，但是牠還不失爲南洋的寳庫，爲世界一大資源地，特別是在戰爭時期，牠的石油，錫，和橡膠的出產，誰不艷羨呢？</p>
<p>但是東印度的資源，至今已被開發的還只有一部份，廣闊的東印度羣島，資源的實况，還沒有正確的調查，未開發的更多。下面所發現的，自然還只是已經知道的一部份而已。</p>
<p>（甲）農產資源　東印度幾乎全部是農產地，由於地域之廣大，熱帶特有的强烈的陽光，潤澤的雨水，由於這些自然條件的具備，荷蘭的殖民政策，就特別注力於東印度的農業，注力於橡樹·奎寗·甘蔗·茶·咖啡·可可·煙草·椰子·米·玉蜀黍·木棉·胡椒·棕櫚桐油樹　卡沙伐（根可製澱粉·麵包）等植物的大量生產。其中有的是荷印獨占的特產物，有的是世界的商品，推銷於世界，由於此種資源的利用，享受荷印經濟的繁榮。請看東印度農產物的現狀：</p>
<p>主要農產物生產額（單位千公噸）</p>
<p>數字依據同上表</p>
<p>其中生橡膠僅次於舊英屬馬來，爲世界第二生產國，供給全世界需要的四分之一，而橡膠產業即成爲荷印產業中最發達的部門，特別是蘇門答臘所有橡膠精製工廠，是資本主義的大規模的經營，年來已有侵凌英屬馬來之勢。</p>
<p>奎寗爲荷印的特產物，供給全世界需要量的十分之九，荷印政府曾對此獨占的產物經營政府管理的奎寗　，掌握其支配權，而胡椒·棕欖油·及木棉也是東印度獨占的產物。</p>
<p>共次，甘蔗糖，供給全世界生產的百分之八，甘蔗田尤以爪哇東部中部爲多，附有精糖工塲，作資本主義的經營，其資本幾乎完全是荷人資本。</p>
<p>茶在爪哇及蘇門答臘，無處不產，生產量佔全世界產額之百分之十六，近年製茶企業尤爲發達，荷蘭及英美資本，在茶業方面都很活躍，華僑和日本人也有些茶園。</p>
<p>咖啡生產占世界產額的百分之五，烟草生產近年不大發達，其生要生產地爲蘇門答臘之德里地方。</p>
<p>以上是作寫世界商品的生產，而且是以大資本經營的，其中外國投資最多的是橡膠，英·美·法·比占共半數；而椰子油·咖啡·茶及奎寗也有相當多數的外國資本投入，其他椰子乾·米·玉蜀黍等，還是滯留在「原住民農業」的形態，以國內市塲爲主要對象。</p>

<h3>新的特別圓制度　在今後中國商業與金融上的關係</h3>
<p>兩星期以前，報載日本近將設立一個交易營團，此一營團，將成爲「日本對外貿易之唯一統制機關」，而其當前工作，則爲硏究特別圓制度之運用。此一消息，關係極爲重大，不可不有充份的認識。</p>
<p>根據國府經濟最高顧問石渡莊太郞氏之聲明，則特別圓之比率，與現今流行之軍票十八元對中儲券之比率，並無關係。由此看來，比仿上海區域今有貨物運至共榮圈以內共他一個區域，共代價爲特別圓一千元，但所代表之中儲券數額並非爲中儲券五十五百元，而爲超過中儲券五千五百元的一個數額，亦未可知。反過來說，貨物所値爲五千五百元，合成軍票，當爲軍票一千元，但如合成特別圓，則或不到此數，亦未可知。可是，有着軍票一千元，並不能在日本國內購買任何貨品，但用特別圓（一千圓或比較史少之數額，）則可以購買。</p>
<p>時別圓是整倘共榮圈內的一個特別幣制，但中儲券與聯銀券並不因此喪失它們本身的地位。它們的本身，非但可以加强，並且足以自給。因爲石渡氏說過，移管的敵產交與中央儲備銀行以後，可使中儲行的基礎，因之更形强化。</p>
<p>說到中儲券，政府當局已經迭次聲言，必當建樹其本身的地位。所有一切謠諑，宣傳，與憂慮，以爲中儲券將由一種新的貨幣來代替它，可以說是毫無根據了。中儲券非但絕無變更的可能，並且中儲券在華中區的推廣，已經達到無遠弗屆的程度。當然，中儲券的本質，並不是包羅萬象的。不過，在中國國內，它是唯一通用的貨幣。至於特別圓乃爲適應環境而設的一種適當貨幣，專以用諸國外貿易的。</p>
<p>這種新的幣制，可以行使原有幣制所不能行使的職權。經濟學大家里加圖認為最完備的貨幣爲紙幣。可是，近代幣制的發展，又已達到更超越的程度，蓋在一方面，對內流通，有其一種固定的通貨，而在另一方面，對外貿易，復有另一種固定的通貨。特別　便是近代幣制發展的一個例子。</p>
<p>戰時經濟的原則，在於以最低量的消費，促成最高量的生產。所以貨幣的使命，要使其能够推進生產，同時，復能够限止其消耗性的外溢。總而言之，戰時的幣制，貴在它的當時流動性，而不在它的平時保守性。我們眼前所已經有到的幣制進化情態，例如特別圓制度之創立，—便是適應時勢而產生的一個結果，非但是値得我們的認識，並且値得我們的擁護。（依人譯三月一日泰晤士報）</p>
<p>經濟評言</p>
<h3>穩定幣値與貨物準備</h3>
<p>在最近政府宣佈之戰時經濟政策綱領中，關於穩定幣値者有云：「通貨政策應與生產力之增進相配合，以求幣値之穩定」，此一政策，洵可謂最新貨幣理論之反映。</p>
<p>發新貨幣理論爲何？即貨幣之良好而合理的準備，並不是黄金·白銀·與外匯，乃是直接可以滿足人們日常生活慾望之各種必需品。過去各國之所以以金銀外滙爲通貨之準備者，揆其用意，亦莫非以爲有了金銀外滙以後，即可以獲得各種生活必須品，以資生存。現在久戰之後，各種物資相當缺乏，皆不如戰前之充裕豐富，故雖有金銀外滙，亦大多換不到物資，金銀外滙反成死物，如美國現雖擁有大量金銀及多額外匯，但與作戰物資之獲得，並不發生些微關係。以是，論者謂「個人而吞金者，痴男女是也，國家而吞金者，羅斯福專政下之北美合衆國是也」。</p>
<p>國府周財長在上月十二日舉行之全國經濟委員會首次會議中報吿，謂中央儲備銀行去年底之發行準備，計有現金準備二十六億元弱，保證準備十一億元弱，故現金凖備常超過七成，較法定現金準備率高出一成，故新法幣實並無絲毫不健全膨脹現象之可言。吾儕小民對周部長此種切實報吿，自甚欣慰，惟目前形勢，通貨之準備已不在現金之多寡，而在日用貨物之豐嗇。設中外當局，朝野上下，此後能多多從增加日用貨物之生產着手，排除一切阻礙生產之困難，使物價趨平，民生安定，中儲券之購買力日趨强化，則吾人定將五體投地矣。</p>
<h3>蘇北是華中的烏克蘭　增強國府治下的農產</h3>
<p>當初事變發生的時候，蘇北一帶在文化上，經濟上不爲人家重視，但是隨着事變的遷延，華中經濟也跟着重要，於是在這一兩年來，各方面都重視蘇北經濟，現在蘇北行營所管轄的蘇北區域，祗有鹽城·東台·寳應·與化·高郵·江都·儀徵·泰縣·泰興·如皐·南通·靖江·海門·啓東等十餘縣，面積和台灣差不多，人口的有一千二百萬。耕地面積比了日本要大十分之八。出產的農產物，有棉·米·小麥和大豆，高梁，玉蜀黍，還有許多其他雜糧。南通四周的南部地區和阜寗一帶產棉，靠近東部海岸產鹽，沿運河一帶產小麥雜糧。根據歷年的調查統計，所出產的東西，除了當地消費之外，還有餘額供應其他地方，大約可輸出小麥十萬噸，米三萬噸。本年度的棉產，估計可收○○萬担。關於蘇北的增產計劃，據關係方面的調查，如果投資二百萬萬日圓的話，可以增加生產三倍以上，是否可以實現多少，當然還是個問題，但是在增強華中農產上，今後蘇北必然占了極重要的地位，所以這次作戰，不但在軍事上可以確保蘇北地區”就是在經濟建上，不久的將來，必然有相當的成就，對於華中經濟的貢獻確屬偉大。（三月一日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>美德對西班牙　出口貿易比較</h3>
<p>海通社相林二十八日電—德外交部發言人昨在情報會議中稱，美國駐西班牙大使海斯於星期五發表演說，渠竭力避免將美國對西班牙之出口貨與德國對西班牙之出口貨作一對比，而認美國對西班牙出口貨之微細爲航務上困難。該發言人旋指出德國供給西班牙之煤斤，價値年達六百萬至七百萬西幣。此外，西班牙國有鐵路每月獲得德國煤斤一萬二千至一萬五千噸，故美國對西班牙之出口，殊不能與德國比較云。</p>

<h3>美國的『戰時最低生活計劃』　報紙縮至一九三九年五分之一</h3>
<p>黄金過剩的金元國美國，因爲物資消耗過大，國內資材不够補充，後方生活竟會鬧起窮來。最近，美國戰時生產局草擬一個「戰時最低生活計劃』，看了它的內容，就可以領略最近美國國情。</p>
<p>這個計劃一旦實現，那末奢侈慣了的美國國民，不免要感到苦楚。聽說這個計劃的內容，比了一九四一年度消費額，食糧要减少百分之七一、八，飲料减百分之五四、九，衣服减百分之七五、二，書籍刋物减百分之二九、三。</p>
<p>報紙的篇幅，縮小到一九三九年的五分之一，電影，戲劇，也受限制。其中以食料品的恐慌爲最嚴重，一切罐頭食品不日停止發售，準備全部採用計口授給制。所以二月二十日那天，有大批爭購罐頭食品的顧客，蜂湧到伙食店裏，情形異常混亂。至於農林减產的原因，都爲了徵兵，同時因爲軍需工廠提高工資？所以許多農民，陸續離開農村，不是應徵入伍，便到代價高貴的車需工廠去做工。農林部方面，爲了挽回農產起見，決定在春耕秋收之時，准許工廠的工人給假歸鄉務農，另外再提出八千萬元的增產獎勵金，然而農村方面非但不表歡迎，反而說：『金錢不能用來耕植』，他們希望提高農產物的價格，並盼當局供給農具。總之，美國當局的辦法，無非想替軍隊先來解決糧食恐慌。（三月一日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>物物交換中之　阿根廷與玻里維亞</h3>
<p>二月二十七日巴西京城海通社電電—玻里維亞決定以橡膠二百五十噸供給阿根廷，以資交換阿根廷之機器，用以發展玻里維亞之糖工業。是項物物交換之協議，業已在此間舉行云。</p>
<h3>考慮合併　本市中日調查機關</h3>
<p>全國經濟委員會，爲促進生產，特設調查處搜集各項增產資料，按中國事變及大東亞戰爭發生後，中國及大東亞共榮圈內各地之調查工作，推進甚力。現今日本國內有調查研究聯盟，直屬於內閣？統轄一切調查事宜，並有東亞研究所，從事調查東亞共榮圈內之政治，經濟，文化等項，該研究所調查之資料，供企劃院作施政參考。滿洲國政府圾近成立滿洲調查機關聯合會，歸總務廳企劃處統轄，定於三月下旬招待中日滿三國之調查關係人士，舉行首次大會。關於中國方面調查工作由大東亞省調查課統轄，並在大東亞省內設立對華調查機關聯合會，負責指導。其他各地之調查機關，在蒙疆張家口有蒙疆調查機關聯合會，在北京有華北調查聯合委員會，在靑島有靑島調查機關聯合會，在漢口有武漢調查機關聯絡會，在厦門有厦門調查機關聯合會，在廣東有廣東調查機關聯合委員會，以上各調查機關，統歸富地大使館事務所，總領事館等機關之調查官指揮，中日滿三國之調查機構，殆已完備，必能因而促進中日滿三國之政治，經濟，文化，思想融和，北京方面之中日調查機關，業已合併統一，上海方面自全國經濟委員會設立調查處之後，亦必能促進統一，聞關係當局正在考慮與北京取同樣措置，合併中日調查機關，俾得統一進行云。（三月一日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>又創新紀錄之　銀行存款額</h3>

<h3>抑平物價的澈底對策</h3>
<p>華中各項物價的漲風，尤其是生活必需品，每天扶搖直上，簡直漠視當局的抑平物價政策。統制物價的希望，無過於今日的迫切。假使任其　　，這不營陷民生於絕境，對於整個社曾經濟，無疑是一種嚴重的威脅，負責管理物價的當局者，他的責任是何等重大。</p>
<p>物價的在漲，當然是由於華中的種種複雜原因所造成。並不是單純經濟上關係而發生的。有些是對於物價的心理作用所引起，這種心理作用，並不是沒有辦法解決的事，祗要看當局的施策如何，也不難把它根本消除。然而澈底抑平物價的施策尙未實現，所以物價的漲風，奔騰不已。管理物價的負責當局，對於這一點，自有深思熟慮的必要。</p>
<p>所謂心理作用，是什麽？一言以蔽之，就是盲目的把物價看漲。以爲今天比昨天貴，明天一定比今天貴，這種觀念，才使一般人你也囤積，我也投機，所有資金，完全用在囤貨上面。這種傾向便造成了今日的狂漲。所以，物價對策的重心，須要用强有力的手段來眼定物價。如果這種方針能够澈底實行，那末，物價自然能平。所謂强有力手段，未必　指法律制栽的手段，意思是要網羅和平區的財界巨擘，使他們來協力推進，並延攪在社會上有號召力的人材襄助處理。同時，再用法律制裁手段，相信它的効力必然不小。</p>
<p>物價要是有了嚴厲的限制，投機分子多數要失去與趣，就會把囤貨出籠求脫。假使他們說貨求售。就可以設定適當的收用辦法來收買囤貨’或許用發行各種商品庫券等等的辦法，如果一邊再用强制手段，那麽囤貨份子在腹背受制之下，勢必無計可施。爲了抑平物價起見，我們特別要强調的，就是這點。</p>
<p>當然這些施策一定要和一般的物價施策並行。維持通貨信用，復興一般生產，加强金融統制等，不用說都應該一層一層的積極推進，這樣一來，把物價看漲的心理當然可以消除乾凈。我們以爲華中物價的中心就在這理。亟盼中日當局及早推動澈底抑平物價的施策</p>

<h3>小型工廠的生產問題</h3>
<p>— 王衛</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>近一時期　經濟問題中，比較突出的口號該是「增加生產」了。但應該說，這一口號在理論上探討還不　普遍和深入，實際表現當然更談不上；關於這，的確需要有個通盤的計劃，譬如說，怎樣從橫的方面使工業農業鍍業能够平均發展，縱的方面怎樣來調整生產關係及加强生產力—手工及機械—等等。在同一時候，我們來發掘一下實際生產過程中的一些問題—或者說得明白些，是一些困難的問題，用來作爲大家在硏究增加生產這個大題目時的參攷資料，想來是有其意義的。</p>
<p>中國是個農業經濟形態的國家，工業發展還很幼稚；從生產力上講，手工到機械生產還正是蛻化過程，因之，小型生產在整個生產量上還佔着重要的地位，根據上海市機械工業聯合會在「機械工業一覽」里的統計，（其統計以其所屬會員爲限。）一千五百餘家的機械五金工廠中，資本在一萬到五萬的要佔百分之三六·五；五萬到十萬百分之十七；十萬到二十萬佔百分之一一·三；二十萬到五十萬佔百分之一八·六；五十萬以上僅佔一六·六；機械五金工業的情形如此，其他當可想見了。</p>
<p>所以，對於這些小型工廠，在目前局勢上，其在生產上所遇到的一些困難問題，是應該予以充分注意的。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>小型工廠有許多特點，首先是資本額短少，它不像大工廠那樣，除了一定的鉅額的資本金外，還有大量的流動資金可資運用；同時，正因爲資金短少，它在生產現模上就形成非常狹小，假使說大的棉織工廠可以同時出品毛巾被單…等等物品，那宋從小型的工廠講，就變成毛巾廠或被單廠了；而且即使出品一種物品，其在製造過程中，還是要依靠外力的；譬如有許多專門製造某些鎖類或文具用品的小型五金工廠，當它獲得了銅鐵等原料之後，它還不能够把某種用品製造完工而去銷行市上，因爲它沒有足够的資金來添設翻砂，電鍍，拋車等等生產上所必需的機器設備，於是就不得不依借外力，而這些外力因有着客觀上的需要，也就形成了獨立的生產機構，如電鈹廠，翻砂作等等。所以從這一點上講，小型工廠差不多都不能獨立地生產。同時，正因爲不能獨立地生產，加上一般經營者在生產技術上的落後，所以其生產品就比較粗糙，因之，它便缺乏市塲上的聲譽；所以很多小型工廠就比作了大工廠的附庸，在大工廠經營之下，製造些某種物品的另件或某種步驟，利潤當然是很微薄的。但爲什麼小型工廠還能够繼續存在呢？唯一的理由是製造成本低，工人數量少，勞動强度高，設備簡陋…沒有像大工廠那樣，鉅額的製造費用之外還有一筆可觀的管理費用。（包括應酬，廣吿，推銷費用等等）所以，其生產品縱然低劣，恰恰在廣大的中下層市民中獲得其顧主。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>動盪的時局，造成了動盪的經濟形勢；物價飛漲，人民生活費用增高，而生活水準却相反地低洛；但因爲是畸形的發展，所以一般地是富者愈富，窮者更窮，工廠也一樣，大工廠有無敵的資金作後盾，所以資產搖扶直上；做一日吃一天的小型工廠，有特殊條件的便跟隨而去，但大多數却愈形窘態，至今出盤招租遍遍皆是，反之大工廠，以前沒有股票行市的，現在已顯露頭角，一向有其行市的，正在節節高陞哩！</p>
<p>爲了便利於說明小型工廠生產上的困難性，我想以一個假定的生產來談談。</p>
<p>現在就假定有一筆定貨，價値五萬元，規定一個目的製造時日，照一般市面上的定例，先收定銀五成，計二萬五千元，就應該開始生產了。</p>
<p>生產成本的計算公式是製造成本—原料十人工十製造費用——照一般工廠的利潤率講，大多數是百分之三十，那末這五萬元的定貨，其預計成本該是三萬八千三百元，再根據一般的成本算法，就是「四工六料」，即是說，三萬八千二百元的成本中，其百分之四十是人工（包括製造費用），計一萬五千三百念元；百分之六十是原料，計二萬二千九百八十元。那末這二萬五千元的定銀，就必須立刻去購備所需的原料，剩下來祇有二千另念元了，這些數目，加上廠方本身的流動資金，就要來墊付一個月里的人工跟製造費用。</p>
<p>這樣看來，能够賺錢的當然是極少數，能够不虧本已是幸運得很；很多都在「偷鷄不着蝕把米」之下結束；所以同行間有句話，叫做「不做餓煞，做做苦煞。」</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>問題在那裏呢？</p>
<p>問題是很明顯的：「鈔票賺鈔票」的市面，靠「做一日吃一天」的小工廠就遭到了厄運；大工廠可以大批的製造存貨，小工廠無資余後盾，不得不接收定貨；所以貨品未製成以前，定貨的商行已經賺了錢；小工廠爲商行製造利潤，目前的情形就是如此。</p>
<p>很多銀行錢莊並不把這些小型工廠常作放款對象，儘管輿論頓促多多向工業貸放，但實際上還保持着「求者卻之，卻者供之，」的方針，這一方針不知傷害了多少生產機構的成長。</p>
<p>製造費用中的米的問題（上月間各工廠曾要求當局加工人額外派給數量。）以　物料工具購配的困難與高價，差不多成爲管理生產者的主要考慮的問題了。</p>
<p>小型工廠生產上的困難問題就是如此，當然克服不是沒有辦法的。</p>
<p>首先，我們希望物價波動問題能夠得到迅速的解決。其次是市塲的開拓，上海的工業生產一向是供給外埠的，現在因爲運瑜交通統制等關係，對華北以及其他城市的貿易便一落千丈了，這就影響到上海工業生產的膨脹與活躍。第三，是金融與工業和聯繫應該加强，「增加工業貸放」這句口號應該有其實際步驟，而不祇成爲一種粉飾的標榜。特別對於小工廠，方法上或者可以通過各業公會來進行，像復興銀行舉辦的工商貸款是應該予以提倡的。第四，當局應該給予各工廠以實際的扶助，譬如戶口米額外派給的增加，各種原材料購配的便利等等。</p>

<h3>戒之在色</h3>
<p>— 柳蘇</p>
<p>孔子說：「君子有三戒：少之時，血氣未定，戒之在色。及其壯也，血氣方剛，戒之在　。及其老也，血氣旣衰，戒之在得。」這三戒，孔子都是從人的生理上說的，是有所根據的。本文專討論第一戒。</p>
<p>用現代科學眼光來分析，少年人最易爲「色」所迷，或單相思，或因失戀而自殺，或因三角戀愛而決鬭，或因戀愛不遂而雙雙服毒。一般人在「少之時」，確有爲「色」而犧牲一切之可能。</p>
<p>科學地說，人體的機構到了某種境界，就有某種舉勸和現象。人類到了「少之時」，正如孔子所說的「血氣未定」，性的衝動就發生了。人類不是禽獸，性的衝動，不能隨意滿足，必須如一番「克已復禮」功夫，所以孔子說：「戒之在色」。</p>
<p>就一般情形看來，現社會的少年，須特別「戒之在色」的，是一般富家子女。他們平　錦衣玉食，養尊處優，終日無所事事，於是大鬧戀愛，肉麻當有趣。</p>
<p>孔子只說「少之時」的人「戒之在色」，可是事實上，還有兩種人，也須「戒之在色」呢？</p>
<p>第一種人是那些「爲富不仁者流」，在飽暖之餘，以異性爲玩物。從前，專制時代的帝王，顯宦，所產生的性的醜史，可說「史不絕書」。商業資本主義的社會裏，繼帝王顯宦而起的，爲富商鉅買名媛貴婦。他們的外表，確是雍容華貴，可是他們的性生活，則頗多不堪聞問。眞是「不可言也，言之醜也！」</p>
<p>第二種人是那些僞道學家。他們在少年人面前，態度莊嚴肅穆，對於性生活隻字不提。如果提及了，給青年人一盆冷水。可是他們的私牛活，糜爛不堪，有的狎娼，有的納妾。目中固然有妓，心中更未嘗無妓。孔子說：「鄕愿者，德之賊也」，這句話可以送給這些僞道學家。</p>
<p>孔子只說戒之在色」，怎麽「戒之」，却沒有說明。這個問題是「性敎育」所研究的，以後有機會再加討論吧。</p>
<h3>改行記</h3>
<p>— 雪</p>
<p>妻一向憧憬着我能改行，因為她也受得夠了。做了中學敎員的妻子『間壁的方少爺不是嗎？年紀比你輕，他們紗廠裏，去年的紅利就有二萬多呢？平時晏起早歸，辦公時間又少，雪，我希望你也能失改行，改當一個紗廠的職員，那末方師母讚譽他丈夫的時候我也同樣可拿你去比，總算出這麽一口氣。」妻子這樣的話，少說在我的耳中已有三次了。</p>
<p>眞的，敎師生活太苦了，日日在粉筆灰堆中生活着，得來的祗是一家三口的買米的錢，難道不吃白飯，假使不是「薄有資產」的話是早已做乞兒了。</p>
<p>學校中，也有好幾個學生的父親，聽說都是做「紗」的，西裝革覆，與我的十八歲的建兒比，那眞是無從說起了，破棉袍，老布鞋，讀的書也都是向舊書店拍來的舊書。爲了自已的生活，更受了妻的慫恿，我亦想把「淸高」的敎書生活辭去，東託西託的託了一般朋友，想把教書生艱　從　結束。坐在家裏靜等，等七個朋友的　音。</p>
<p>說也可憐，七個朋友中，居然有四個，連我也不如，四百元一月的薪水還須自吃飯，其餘的三人據說還混得過去。可是還是「淸高」得很的敎書生涯，混得過去的原因，大半是「　職多，小「弄要」，託了他們一月了，還沒有回音，我也預備打破「預定計劃」了。</p>
<p>又過了一個星期，忽然接到一封具名「××織綢廠緘」的信，拆閱之下，才知請我過去談談，正在莫名其妙的當兒，妻笑着對我說那綢廠的職位正是她託了間壁方少爺的效果呢</p>
<p>談也談過了。任我爲秘書。我想從此出頭了，雖然不是紗廠，但是綢廠，據說也不錯呢，同樣的有一萬二萬的紅利可分，一面寫了一封「四六」父的信給方少爺道謝，一面又把藏着的古文辭類纂出來，因爲商業塲中的調調兒，我是二十年沒溫了！</p>
<p>一日進廠，度的純是寫字間生活，起初猶覺得冷靜，因爲室中除了打字的練習生外，就祇我一人，在這裏不必傘「破」了的喉嚨「苦喊」，也不必手握粉筆的「直寫」。</p>
<p>薪俸，的確比以前多了二百元有奇，可是我不在乎，妻對我說「隔壁」方先生說綢廠中的紅利不下於紗廠呢？」</p>
<p>漸漸的我感到乏味了，感到虛僞了，眼裏沒有天眞無邪的孩子們，純是下級對上級的虛僞的敷衍，眼中沒有談談說說的伺事們，祗有打字機的搭搭聲，大槪是「行難諧俗」吧；他們對我似乎也有點討厭了，因爲我是的確不知盧偽的啊！</p>
<p>上級對我變得冷淡了，我祗得「閉門居」了，自請辭職的布吿下，我回到了以前的所厭棄了的地方，同事們同學們，都問我過去半年在何處，我祗苦笑了一聲。</p>
<p>妻怪我命運中註定的是酸溜溜的窮敎師，方師母還是說我前世勿會修。</p>
<p>改行也總算改過了，還是守着本分，來敎育一批天眞無邪的孩子吧！</p>
<h3>根</h3>
<p>— 辛波</p>
<p>在這篇小說裏，並沒有驚心動魄的故事，更沒有離奇曲折的情節，這只是某一個時代裏某　種人生的寫眞。</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>廳堂上坐着一個將近五十歲的鄕下人，爍亮的保險燈光，照出了他身上的灰布　棉襖，臉上的條條皺紋，和頭上的蓬蓬亂髪。他沒有敢好好坐着，因此寬大的椅面，空出了裏面一大半，而全椅子所負載的重量，也只有往當坐人時的二分之一。</p>
<p>他的身體一動不動，便是眼睛，也一瞬不瞬。他好像呆在那裏。可是他並不呆，他在用心聽，聽右首書房裏低低的談話，聽那久待着的召喚。</p>
<p>『老根，老根，」果然一個竭力喊得響些的啞澀聲音，隔着一挅牆，由書房門裏透了出來，『你進來！』</p>
<p>他，老根，一聽見這喊聲，好像觸了電，立刻從椅子上跳起來，一面連連應着『來了，來了，』等到他聽見「你進來，」他的一隻右脚已經跨進書房了。</p>
<p>他一走進去，眼睛上好像蒙了一層膜，有些看不大淸楚。水烟的烟，香烟的烟，炭盆上銅壺裏的水蒸汽，氤氳成了一片，隔在他與別人的中間。這使他立刻明白，他不能再那樣的忽忙。他的第二步，馬上便緩了下來。</p>
<p>彎着背，聳着肩，微徵將下　突出上額縮　的面孔，裝着笑容，他顚着脚，一步一步地，走到了一個手捧水烟袋的老人面前，低低地，但熱誠而愉快地，叫了一聲：「黄老爺。』</p>
<p>黄老爺坐在炕牀上在咕嚕　地吸着水烟，聽見老根叫他，路爲點了一下頭。</p>
<p>『楊老爺，』老根將身體側轉了些，又對坐在黄老爺對面的一個老人叫了一聲，也是低低的聲音，不過沒有叫黄老爺時那樣　勁，却透着隨便的意味，使人聽了，明白他們方才已經見過，或者他們時常相見，並不拘禮。（一）</p>
<h3>夜半呼聲</h3>
<p>— 天明</p>
<h3>「等待」先生小傳</h3>
<p>— 寗巴岑</p>
<p>在我們的範圍之內，有一位靑年，他姓「等」名「待」。因他的處世哲畢是抱定等待主義，所以人們都稱他是等待先生。</p>
<p>過去曾有過一天，吶喊的呼聲在四方八面喧　着，人們的擾攘從沉重的壓力下響徹雲霄，於是我們的等待先生很激動地對着他的同志說：「等待着吧，我們所希望的那麽一天，已經很近了』。</p>
<p>他的同志唯唯稱是。</p>
<p>經過四五年，他的話確實言中了。因爲在一個黑夜裏，空中響了一陣劇烈的霹靂。因此等待先生對他的伙伴說：「果然不出我的意料，這末轟轟烈烈的一天終於到了，等待著吧，這還是開始哩！」</p>
<p>「恭賀你，老哥的眼光眞不差，可是你也得盡力啊！」</p>
<p>「你眞是傻瓜，盡什麽力呢？祗有自然的變律會使我們滿意的，用不着去推動。所以我們祗要等待着過那自由和幸福的日子好了！」</p>
<p>他的伙伴聳聳肩，走開了。</p>
<p>風雲莫測，滄桑多變。日子一天一天的過去了，可是等待先生的環境也像故意和他作對似的，變壞了，他感覺窒息得很。</p>
<p>窒息和苦悶，使他牽動了一下向前進取的心，可是一轉念却嚇得他蟄伏在牛角尖裏等待著。那裏使他更喘不過氣來。他伸出了頭窺視一下天空：天空仍是黝黑的。於是他喊出：「再等待着吧，鷄聲啼時，天自然全亮的，理想的樂園也會來了。」</p>
<p>然而等待先生眼有　個眞正不幸福的日子不但沒有到來，而且還是很遼遠的，因此他不由得動搖他的信心了。他的確有些悲觀。</p>
<p>一天，爲了排除他的悲觀氣氛，他想出去遊眺一番新勢面，趁這時呼吸呼吸些新鮮空氣，曬一下陽光，不料還未曾步出門外，就看見滿街充滿恐怖的骷髏被「命運」之神懲罰着，還有無數餓莩轆轆地滾來滾去；他又把視綫轉到另一邊去，那邊却是些刁滑的狐狸精，毒蛇猛獸，還有吃人的妖怪。他面孔蒼白了，四肢麻木地倒下去。</p>
<p>忽然間他的伙伴血淋淋的從鬼怪羣中趕來把等待先生扶起。</p>
<p>『老兄，』伙伴對他說：「現在你可明白了，可是你有什麽感想？追還過去會使您更感痛舌，我們必須要現在能多盡一分力量，多播下一粒堅實而有用的種子，那末你現在的理想，在未來一定會使你得到滿意的收穫的。因此觀望如等待不會帶給你幸福，而你的幸福是要自己去掙取的，不然你是太自私了。瞧吧，眼前的一切現象，何處不需要我們去工作？我們要在被摧毀的廢墟裏肩荷起建設的任務，以期抵達新生的坦途上去。」</p>
<p>『別談吧，傻瓜！我不過偶然神經失常罷了……但你所說的那些，人們早在那裏艱辛地做着，所以我們姑且等待那個玫瑰色的日子到來好了。」</p>
<p>聳了聳肩之後，他的伙伴丢下卑視的眼光走開了。</p>
<p>又是幾年過去了，可是幾年來辛酸和痛苦的生活對於我們的等待先生就像幾十年似的</p>
<p>他的頭髮頒白了，額角上印着深溝似皺紋，顴骨拼命地凸出，他的峋嶙的軀壳就等於骷髏。他奄奄一息地睡在床上對着他從前的實幹伙伴說：</p>
<p>『生命爲什麽這樣短促，我是不能再等待了，道是多麽可惜……爲什麼我不能看見那理想的幸福的日子的到來呢……我是這麽年靑，我不願意死……我明白了，你是不錯的……啊，我要工作……可是我已沒有希望了！』</p>
<p>『我們的等待先生斷氣了！』靑年伙伴輕鬆地說。</p>
<p>可是我們的範圍之內，等待先生的朱死徒弟們還多着哩！</p>

<p>國人最壞的觀念，一過了四十歲五十歲，便自以爲老了不中用了。要享淸福！不再像過去的努力奮鬥。</p>
<p>這種不良的觀念，該有打倒的一日。</p>
<p>孔子曰：「三十而立，四十而不惑」，我們三十歲以前，可以說是「嘗試」的生活混混噩噩，沒有經騐，也有老是談情說愛，浸在雪花杳水精裏的。</p>
<p>到了四十歲，經騐也漸漸豐富，人生也經過磨鍊了，思想也有把握了，工作的效力，也增進了。一個人事業的失敗，大概都在四十歲以前，一個四十歲過來的人，經營事業，不像三十歲以前那樣容易失敗，這是事實。</p>
<p>我們到了四十歲五十歲六十歲，這三十年中，正是有所作爲的時期，外國的政洽家企業家發明家等的黃金時代，就是四十歲至六十歲。法國有句話「生活始於四十」（LifeBegine　at　Forty）就是說：人生到了四十歲，事業才是開始。</p>
<p>外國人能實行「老當益壯」這句話，一般中年人老年人，領導着中國的靑年邁進，所以國家會强盛起來。國民生活，有蓬勃的氣象。</p>
<p>四十以後的人們，正是你奮發有爲的時候，「老當益壯」，人人如此，國家才有希望了。</p>
<p>中國更需要中年與老年人的努力。</p>

<h3>On the Question of Improving Administrative Efficiency</h3>
<p>Since the National Government joined the war, wartime systems and facilities have begun to develop in an all-round way. Whether in politics, military affairs, economics, or education, everything has begun to become active. However, there is still a considerable distance between all policies and implementation methods. Therefore, the issue of improving administrative efficiency is the most important task at present.</p>
<p>We have always believed that the most basic condition for improving administrative efficiency is to improve personnel administration and implement meritocracy. The government must absorb a large number of genuine talents from all aspects of the country. The personnel administration in political institutions at all levels must implement a personnel policy of "right time," "right place," and "right talent." Only then can all the government's good policies be effectively implemented. However, to implement meritocracy, we must first thoroughly break the past practices of nepotism, favoritism, and sectarianism. If we do not first break the past habit of using people based on personal connections, it will be impossible to find truly talented people. The most sound governments in modern countries have the measure and courage to heavily rely on opposition parties and non-partisans. Especially during wartime, it is necessary to absolutely adopt meritocracy and recruit outstanding members from opposition parties and non-partisans to work together. Only in this way can the government itself be strengthened.</p>
<p>For example, the National Economic Commission established in January was originally an institution of the utmost importance after the war began. The first group of appointed members numbered more than twenty, but the plenary meeting was only held once every three months. Later, more than ten new members were added. Originally, the concentration of talent was the most gratifying phenomenon, but if personnel are added arbitrarily and not all of them are experts, then on the one hand, it will not be able to obtain public understanding and make the people value this new economic institution. On the other hand, it is also sufficient to affect the sense of responsibility of the members. In terms of improving administrative efficiency, this is just one example. We believe that any political institution must have a clear direction and talent standards in using people, especially during wartime. It is absolutely impossible to casually assign a person to an inappropriate institution.</p>

<h3>Elite Japanese Army and Navy Troops Enter Guangzhou Bay</h3>
<p>With the full understanding of the French government, elite Japanese army and navy troops entered the French concession in Guangzhou Bay on February 21, thwarting the enemy's attempt to stir up trouble. From this, we can further strengthen Japan's invincible war situation.</p>
<p>The outer barriers of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, connecting Malaya, Java, Borneo, and New Guinea, are even more consolidated. If the enemy wants to counterattack from that area again, it will inevitably increase sacrifices. It is obvious that the United States intends to use mainland China as its most powerful base to strengthen its counterattack against Japan. Roosevelt and Song Meiling also emphasized this point during their meeting. When their ambitions are stirring, they will definitely act recklessly by any means. This is evidenced by the precedents of invading French North Africa and capturing Madagascar. When the United States strengthens its base in China, needless to say, the French concession in Guangzhou Bay will definitely be included. From this point of view, the entry of the Japanese army into Guangzhou Bay can be said to be a necessary preemptive measure.</p>
<p>Ensuring the Guangzhou Bay area is of great significance in completing the Greater East Asia War. Conversely, if the bay is occupied by enemy forces and a base is built, what impact will this have on us? The significance can naturally be understood by repeatedly comparing these two points. After this successful entry, our supply line is safer, and the defense of Vietnam can also be consolidated. The inner and outer barriers of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere can be as solid as a rock and as impenetrable as a golden city.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the threat to Chongqing has been further increased. Since the Burma Road was cut off, Guangzhou Bay has become the last route for aiding Chongqing, smuggling various materials and ammunition. If we think about this point, then after the Japanese army enters Guangzhou Bay this time, Chongqing's foreign aid route will be completely cut off. What a profound impact this will have on Chongqing, and how serious the blow it will suffer.</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek divides the war of resistance against Japan into three stages. The first stage is the defensive war, the second stage is the preparation for the counteroffensive, and the third stage is the general counteroffensive. However, due to the new offensive by the Japanese army in Central China, Chongqing and Chiang Kai-shek suffered a major blow. This time, the Leizhou Peninsula has been completely controlled. Then, his so-called third stage, the general counteroffensive relying on Britain and the United States as backing, will absolutely not be realized.

<h3>Germany and Italy Hold Military and Political Conference, Decide to Strive for Victory with All Their Might, Ribbentrop Returns to Rome, Delivers Special Letter from Hitler to Italian Prime Minister</h3>
<p>Rome, Allied News Agency, 1st. Official sources announced today that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop met with Prime Minister Mussolini on February 25, delivering a personal letter from Head of State Hitler. He also held four meetings from February 24 to 28, discussing various issues related to Europe and the joint operations of the Tripartite Pact. It was decided that both countries would fight with all their might until the complete annihilation of the enemy forces and the eradication of the red scourge in Europe. Both countries also decided to establish a new order in Europe after achieving final victory based on justice and cooperation. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop returned to the country last night to report back. Those who participated in the meeting on the Italian side included Deputy Foreign Minister Bastianini, Chief of General Staff Lieutenant General Ambrosio, Deputy Chief of Staff Major General Vallemon, and Italian Ambassador to Germany Alfieri, who accompanied Ribbentrop. When Prime Minister Mussolini met with the German Foreign Minister, military and political advisors from both countries also attended the talks. Ribbentrop also met with former Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires, the Spanish Ambassador, the Finnish Minister, and the Chargés d'Affaires of Romania, Hungary, Croatia, Slovakia, and Bulgaria.</p>
<p>Rome, Allied News Agency, 1st. Official sources announced today that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was received in audience by Italian King Emmanuel on February 27 and presented the King with the Grand Cross of the Golden Eagle awarded by German Head of State Hitler to the Italian Crown Prince.</p>
<p>Berlin, Huitong News Agency, 1st. Last November and February, Mussolini returned the visit to Munich. Later, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano also returned the visit to the German Head of State's headquarters. This time, the German Foreign Minister returned the visit to Rome because Mussolini concurrently serves as Foreign Minister. As for Hitler himself not going, it was because he was unable to spare the time due to pressing military affairs. The Head of State will not be able to go to Munich in person for this year's anniversary of the founding of the National Socialist Party, also because of pressing military affairs. In addition, there are two things that should be noted: (1) The Axis powers have once again made it clear that they will not negotiate peace without achieving victory; (2) The Axis powers have made it clear that they guarantee the establishment of a new order in Europe. This is a European Charter that opposes the Atlantic Charter, and it is also a blood letter for the people of Europe to resist communism.</p>
<p>Berlin, Huitong News Agency, 1st. A German Foreign Ministry spokesperson told foreign reporters today that the communiqué released in Berlin today regarding the talks between Ribbentrop and Mussolini is sufficient to dispel the rumors spread by foreign countries last week. The communiqué stated that the Axis powers are in complete agreement on the war situation and recognize Bolshevism as the deadly enemy of Europe that must be eradicated. The German Foreign Minister's reception of representatives from friendly and allied countries is not a special event. Such receptions will be held again in the future.</p>
<h3>Manchuria Celebrates National Founding Anniversary, Japanese Emperor Presents Commemorative Medal to Manchurian Emperor, German Head of State Sends Congratulatory Telegram to Manchurian Emperor</h3>
<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency, 1st. Yesterday (1st) was the National Founding Day of Manchuria. China, Japan, and Manchuria held celebratory radio speeches. The following is the text of the radio address by the President of the Executive Yuan of our country.</p>
<p>Radio Address by Wang, concurrently President of the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>Today is the 11th anniversary of the founding of the friendly Manchurian Empire. I would like to extend my deepest congratulations on behalf of the National Government of the Republic of China. Since the founding of the Manchurian Empire, it has cooperated with the friendly Japanese Empire with one heart and one mind to protect the great cause of East Asia. It has worked hard to make progress. At the same time, it has made the greatest efforts in various domestic constructions, making steady progress and changing with each passing day. On the occasion of this 11th anniversary, the national strength and people's strength have been significantly enriched. This is truly admirable.</p>
<p>Since the joint declaration issued by China, Japan, and Manchuria on December 30, two years ago, the governments and people of the three countries have been striving to realize the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere based on the traditional spirit of morality. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War on December 8 last year, the relationship has become closer and the spirit has been further promoted. Last May, I personally visited Xinjing and visited all levels of society. Since then, economic and cultural envoys have traveled frequently, and the speed of sincere unity has increased day by day. This is also gratifying.</p>
<p>Now, friendly Japan is exerting greater national strength to thoroughly eliminate the evil forces of Britain and the United States and lay a permanent peace for East Asia, in order to ensure the war results achieved since the Greater East Asia War and to achieve the completion of the war's objectives. Friendly Manchuria has cooperated with friendly Japan since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War. The Republic of China has recently moved from a statement of sharing weal and woe to participating in the war in order to defeat the common enemies of East Asia. Therefore, the three countries of China, Japan, and Manchuria have formed East Asian comrades from East Asian compatriots, vowing to move towards a common goal with an unwavering determination to share weal and woe. In the future, we should be even more closely connected and pay attention to cultural exchanges and economic interdependence, so that each other can benefit. On the occasion of celebrating the 11th anniversary of the founding of the friendly Manchurian Empire, I express my sincerity and my ardent hope that the friendly Manchurian Empire will have a prosperous national fortune and the people will be blessed. I also hope that the final victory of the Greater East Asia War will be achieved soon and the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will be completed soon.</p>
<p>Radio Address by Japanese Prime Minister Tojo</p>
<p>Tokyo, Central News Agency, 1st. In order to celebrate the 11th anniversary of the founding of Manchuria, China, Japan, and Manchuria held friendly radio broadcasts by Chinese Executive Yuan President Wang, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo, and Manchurian Prime Minister Zhang in the capitals of the three countries tonight. Prime Minister Tojo broadcast a congratulatory message at the Prime Minister's residence at 7:30 tonight, congratulating Manchuria on its great development and expressing his gratitude for Manchuria's cooperation with Japan. The general idea is to recall that the first resolute action to retaliate against Britain and the United States, who have been invading East Asia for a century, was the founding of Manchuria after the Manchurian Incident. Manchuria has always been adapting to the changes in the world situation and seeking the development and strengthening of national strength under the unified cooperation of the whole country. At present, it has become a modern national defense country within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and has sufficient strength. Last year, on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the founding of Manchuria, a grand commemorative ceremony was held, and its national strength has also increased with each year, becoming a factor for starting diplomatic relations with countries around the world. Since its founding, Manchuria has always had a consistent and close relationship with Japan. Today, seeing that Manchuria has become a strong wing of the Axis powers and its national power is developing day by day, I am truly happy. The Manchurian Incident developed into the Sino-Japanese War, and the Sino-Japanese War further developed into the Greater East Asia War. Shortly after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, all the bases in East Asia invaded by Britain and the United States were occupied by the Japanese army, thereby sweeping away their influence in East Asia. At present, Japan has laid a solid foundation for victory and continues to carry out vigorous operations, striving to complete the Greater East Asia War and build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. To complete this great undertaking, it requires the heartfelt cooperation and understanding of all countries and peoples in the Greater East Asia region. Since its founding, Manchuria has always cooperated with Japan in the spirit of one heart and one mind between Japan and Manchuria. Even during the Sino-Japanese War and the Greater East Asia War, it has fully shouldered the responsibility of guarding the north and has also made great contributions to Japan's enhanced combat power. Therefore, it has fully demonstrated the important task of a wing of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in the war. Japan is deeply grateful for the cooperation provided by Manchuria. Today is the 11th anniversary of the founding of Manchuria. I would like to take this opportunity to express my congratulations on the great development of Manchuria once again. At the same time, I would like to express my deep gratitude for Manchuria's cooperation with Japan.</p>
<p>Radio Address by Prime Minister Zhang</p>
<p>Xinjing, Central News Agency, 1st. Yesterday (1st) was the National Founding Day of Manchuria. China, Japan, and Manchuria held celebratory radio broadcasts to show their celebration. Prime Minister Zhang of Manchuria said in his speech that today is the auspicious day of the founding anniversary of our country. I am honored to receive the sincere congratulatory messages from Prime Minister Tojo of the Japanese Cabinet and President Wang of the Executive Yuan, which is truly memorable. Our country celebrated the significant 10th anniversary of its founding last year under the Greater East Asia War. This year, we will focus on implementing the second phase of construction, which I believe you all know well. Our country has decided on its policies for the next ten years based on the experience of the past ten years and adapting to the changing times. On the first anniversary of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War on December 8 last year, we clarified the outline of our basic national policy to China and foreign countries, hoping to make a positive contribution to the completion of the Greater East Asia War with this firm determination in order to seek the eternal prosperity of our country and reform the domestic malpractices at the time of the founding of the country. We also wish to be the pioneer of the revitalization of East Asia. At this time when the Greater East Asia War is being carried out to completion, our country, from the government to the people, is upholding the sacred theory of not separating from each other in life and death, guarding the north, and strictly fighting together with Japan with the supply of food and iron ore. Under the leadership of Chairman Wang, the friendly Republic of China has moved from sharing weal and woe to sharing life and death, and resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States at the beginning of this year. Therefore, our country and China are both sailing in the same boat as Japan, fighting shoulder to shoulder. The world has now seen the heroic posture of our three East Asian countries and deeply believes that the final victory must belong to us. There has never been such a great era in East Asian history as today. On this auspicious day of the founding of the country, I would like to encourage the 43 million citizens to move towards the completion of the important mission undertaken by our country. This is what I would like to say to the citizens of the allied countries.</p>

This is a concrete proof that Japan does not interfere in China's internal affairs. (2) Regarding the changes in the activities of special agencies, all matters that were previously handled by special agencies and involved Chinese administration are now handed over by special agencies to China for handling. (3) Japan's goodwill measures towards China this time, such as returning concessions and transferring enemy property, have had a very good impact on the Chinese side. The general public trusts the National Government more, and at the same time, the war of resistance theory of the Chongqing side has also disappeared.

<h3>Capital Masses Hold Rally to Support India</h3>
<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency, 1st. At this time when the Greater East Asia War of Liberation is underway, the British imperialists, in order to struggle for their final fate, are sparing no effort to use the most brutal means of oppression against India, a link in East Asia.

Therefore, he has fallen into the British trap. Now, although his life is in danger, the spirit of sacrifice is becoming more and more popular in the blood of all Asian comrades. We are willing to take the position of Asian comrades and the greatest sympathy, and to discuss various methods of mutual assistance.</p>

<h3>Wang Jinzai Issues a Letter to His Subordinate Officers and Soldiers</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from the Hubei Front Line, 1st: Wang Jinzai, who was captured by the Japanese army on the 25th, issued a letter to his subordinate officers and soldiers and the general public on the 26th, stating in brief: "Although I was defeated in battle and captured by the Japanese army, I am grateful for the preferential treatment I have received from them. The Japanese army not only does not regard the people as enemies, but also considers soldiers and civilians who have ties to the Chongqing faction as true friends if they sincerely repent their past mistakes, cooperate with the Japanese army, and pledge allegiance to the national government. They will also guarantee their future livelihoods. I now deeply realize that resistance is futile; only peace can save the nation. Therefore, I resolutely change course and hereby declare as follows: 1. The troops under Wang Jinzai will be disbanded immediately. 2.

<h3>Prelude to the Spring Offensive: Germany and the Soviet Union Sharpen Their Swords and Prepare for a Decisive Battle; The Donets River Railway Center is Strategically Indispensable</h3>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border Dispatch from Havas, 1st: German and Soviet forces are currently sharpening their swords and preparing their horses. Once the period of thawing ice and snow has passed, they will restore their positions. Therefore, the Eastern Front situation is now dominated by two major factors: transportation and reserve forces. Based on this, we can almost say that the Winter War has ended. The war currently taking place is not so much an extension of the Winter War, but rather a prelude to the Spring Offensive. The Eastern Front war is in a state of standstill, at least for three weeks. However, the German and Soviet general headquarters are both sharpening their swords and preparing their horses, preparing to launch a decisive war. Both sides need the best possible transportation system. The reason why the German army is concentrated in the Donets River railway centers of Kramatorsk and Lozovaia is because of this. The Red Army achieved a major victory this winter, but in terms of transportation, the German side is still better than the Soviet Union. The Axis forces still control a large number of railways, while in the territory recovered by the Red Army, all railways and highways have been destroyed by German vehicles. However, the Red Army has a large number of cavalry, which can compensate for transportation difficulties. In addition, the Red Army is stepping up its efforts to restore various means of transportation in the recovered areas. As for the problem of reserve forces, it is still a major enigma in the current stage of World War II. What the general headquarters of both belligerent countries need today is not "artillery shells," but well-trained manpower capable of driving airplanes, tanks, and artillery to engage in complex modern warfare.</p>
<p>Berlin Dispatch from Allied News Agency, 1st: Fierce battles are also unfolding in the Kramatorsk area on the Eastern Front, especially with the Soviet offensive southwest of the city being quite intense. The German army used tank units and dive bombing to fiercely attack the Soviet army's rear positions, causing extreme damage. They are now pressing the Soviet army westward. In addition, the fierce battle continues in the Mius River area west of Kharkiv. It is reported that the superior Soviet army has broken through the German army's defenses in several places in the area. However, because the connection between the breakthrough units and the main force was severed, they fell into an isolated state and suffered heavy damage due to the fierce attacks of the Italian army. The German army also seems to have launched a fierce counter-offensive southwest of Voroshilovgrad in the Donets Basin. The report from the Reuters war correspondent has also confirmed this fact, stating that "the German army's offensive, with tanks and mechanized units as the main force, is very large in scale."</p>
<p>Ankara Dispatch from Haitian News Agency, 1st: According to supplementary news received here from Moscow, the Soviet army's defense line in the Donets Basin has been broken through by the German army in several places, and the Soviet army was forced to retreat. The German tank division fighting south of Kramatorsk has advanced and is threatening the city. The German army also had a local victory in Lozovaia, so the overall situation is still in chaos. Regarding the situation west of Rostov, the Moscow news stated that the strong German defenses have been conquered.</p>
<p>Vichy Dispatch from Havas, 28th: Last week, the Soviet army launched continuous general offensives on all fronts of the Eastern Front, but they were all repelled by the German army. The Soviet offensive in the Donets area was also blocked by the German army and suffered heavy losses. A Soviet division was also annihilated on the Mius front. On the weekend, the German army launched a counter-offensive in the Krasnoarmeysk and Azov Sea areas, and the fighting was fierce. According to military observers, the Soviet offensive has already lost its importance, and the targets of the Red Army's attack have also changed. The recent Soviet offensive has gradually shown signs of weakness, and the German army has regained the initiative in several places, especially in the Donets coal mining area. The German army has changed from defense to offense. According to Berlin's announcement, the German vanguard has passed Kramatorsk and Lozovaia. In addition, there is also fierce fighting in the Ilmen Lake area in the north, but the Soviet army's repeated offensives have been repelled. Although the Soviet army in the Caucasus area in the south is approaching the port of Novorossiysk, the German fortifications in the suburbs are solid, and it is still difficult for the Soviet army to attack. The Soviet army near Rostov has also made no progress, so the Soviet command may have decided to abandon the plan to attack Taganrog and instead plan to attack the port of Mariupol by a roundabout route.</p>
<h3>Germany Establishes a Decisive Battle System Under the Leadership of the Führer; National Life is Filled with a Wartime Atmosphere, Which Will Have a Great Impact on the Future War Situation</h3>
<p>Berlin Dispatch from Allied News Agency, 1st: Under the leadership of Führer Hitler, the German people have established a national decisive battle system. National life is now full of a wartime atmosphere. All departments have entered the decisive battle stage. After Berlin issued the wartime labor report and the order to close handicraft shops, a dozen high-end restaurants and large stores closed down one after another. The bustling streets of Berlin were filled with a solemn wartime atmosphere. Generally, stores throughout the country were not affected in any way. Only upscale stores still number 20,000. The mobilization rate in transportation is the highest. The Berlin Transportation Company mobilized 25,000 people. The Hitler Youth is assisting with labor. Last year, 3 million people were mobilized, and this year it may increase even more. In terms of culture, publishing houses and newspapers have merged, and many local newspapers have ceased publication. Berlin is scheduled to have five newspapers cease publication. Such liquidation of all private life and efforts to increase productivity to supply the front lines, this unity of the rear will have a great impact on the future war situation.</p>

<h3>Mahatma Gandhi's Fasting Movement From Beginning to End; Struggling for National Independence and Liberation; People All Over the World Express Deep Sympathy</h3>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch from the Central News Agency, 1st: Since India launched the anti-British movement, although it has repeatedly been severely suppressed by the British Indian authorities, the Indian people's struggle against the British has continued to intensify. However, since last autumn, India has been plagued by frequent natural disasters. In addition, due to the inhumane food countermeasures implemented by the British Indian authorities, the general public has long been forced to wander on the brink of starvation. This tyrannical behavior of the British Indian authorities is condemned by both gods and men. Mahatma Gandhi resolutely used death as a weapon and announced a three-week fast starting on February 10th. As a 74-year-old, it is inevitable that he will be on the verge of death. When he was in a state of exhaustion ten days after the fast, it was impossible for him to talk to the people serving him. Therefore, it is expected that this may be the last struggle of the Gandhi elder. Looking back at the history of Gandhi's fasting struggle, it began in 1932. Although there are fasting ascetic practices in Indian religious precepts, and Gandhi is also a devout Hindu, his fasting goes without saying. However, there is no precedent for carrying out a fasting struggle with sincere enthusiasm. At that time, when he was in prison, in order to oppose the Indian government's policy of separating elections, he advocated the liberation of the "untouchable class" and began a fast to show his firm resistance. At that time, it shocked all of India, and as a result, Gandhi's ideal of liberating the "untouchable class" was finally realized, and he was released from prison. However, because the authorities did not fully recognize Gandhi's demands, he continued to carry out personal non-cooperation movement as a last resort. As a result, he was arrested again, and he immediately began a fast in prison, betting his life. The Indian government was deeply afraid that he would die as a result, so they released him again. Later, in October 1940, Gandhi began his second personal non-cooperation movement after 1934. At that time, he declared, "I firmly oppose British rule in India in order to win India's independence, and at the same time declare the start of a national non-cooperation movement." The British authorities immediately adopted severe repressive measures to arrest Nehru, the chairman of the National Congress Party, Azad, and many other well-known leaders. Then, on December 20th, the authorities again arrested 11 top leaders of the faction, 31 state premiers, 398 central members, and 398 members of the All-India Committee in a large-scale arrest. At this point, he began his fasting struggle again. Although Gandhi was determined to oppose the British, he had no weapons in his hands, so he had to work hard to fight. In fact, he is even more worthy of the deep sympathy of people all over the world.</p>
<p>Gandhi's Condition Greatly Improved</p>
<p>Lisbon Dispatch from Allied News Agency, 1st: Two days remain in 73-year-old Gandhi's three-week fast. His condition is better again today. He received many visitors yesterday, including children and babies in arms. Gandhi is in good spirits and gave each supplicant a word.</p>
<p>Turkish Capital Dispatch from Havas, 28th: According to a New Delhi dispatch, Gandhi, who has been fasting for 19 days, has not shown any further deterioration in his physical condition, but is extremely weak. According to his son, even if he ends his fast, he will not be able to get out of danger for at least several weeks, because his physical strength is weak, and he will inevitably suffer more losses due to this fast.</p>
<h3>Soong Mei-ling Arrives in New York Yesterday</h3>

Mr. Willkie plans to participate in the party's preliminary elections and attempt to obtain a majority of votes among the delegates so that he can control everything at the national convention in the future.</p>
<p>Lisbon Dispatch from Haitian News Agency, 1st: According to Washington news, in a recent public opinion poll, 51% of those who approved of Roosevelt being re-elected for a fourth term in 1944 if the war had not ended, while 37% opposed Roosevelt's re-election, regardless of whether the war had ended. The remaining 12% did not express an opinion. Therefore, if the war ends before 1944, Roosevelt has no hope of being re-elected.</p>

<h3>British Heavy Artillery Opens on the Front Lines, Preparing to Launch an Offensive. Axis Forces Build Strong Positions in the Southwestern Foothills of the Mareth Line.</h3>
<p>Swiss Capital, Alliance News Agency Dispatch, 1st. Regarding the British Eighth Army's offensive against the German-held Mareth Line in Tunisia, preparations are still underway. Axis infantry and tank units continue to probe the Allied lines for weaknesses. However, the entire theater of war is experiencing rain, severely hindering the movement of armored vehicles and restricting air bombardment. Land warfare is limited to artillery exchanges. According to German intelligence, the British Eighth Army is awaiting reinforcements before launching the offensive. Reconnaissance reports from German aircraft indicate that British heavy artillery units have been steadily arriving at the front lines.</p>
<p>Lisbon, Alliance News Agency Dispatch, 1st. According to news from North Africa, after suffering successive defeats in central Tunisia, the US Fifth Army has received British reinforcements and launched a counteroffensive. However, they have been stopped by Rommel's forces in the Atlas Mountain passes, with no significant changes in the situation. The southern sector of the Tunisian front has also been stable for several days. In northern Tunisia, the Axis forces appear to have suddenly taken the offensive in recent days. On the 27th, German units fought in heavy rain, overcoming the tenacious resistance of Allied forces north and south of Mejez el Bab and advancing a considerable distance.</p>
<p>Swiss Capital, Havas Agency Dispatch, 28th. According to reports from both the Axis and Anglo-American sides, fierce fighting continued in northeastern Tunisia today. Axis forces launched attacks in five directions to test the strength of the Allied lines. Berlin and Rome claim that despite the adverse weather in North Africa, the intensity of the fighting has not diminished. Repeated fierce counterattacks by British forces have been repelled, resulting in heavy losses for the Anglo-Americans, with many tanks destroyed. Axis air forces are highly active over the entire Tunisian front. The Allied side states that General Arnim's forces are conducting probing attacks in five locations in northeastern Tunisia, with three of them stalemated. The remaining two are still ongoing near Mejez el Bab and Sidi Nsir. Axis forces are pressing their attacks on Mejez el Bab. In the south, in the area south of Hceiba, Axis forces continue to withdraw from the Kasserine area. Meanwhile, Algiers Radio announced that the British Eighth Army finally launched its long-delayed offensive against the Mareth Line, held by General Rommel's forces, last night. This news was not mentioned in the latest war report from Cairo, which only stated that enemy forces at the Mareth Line had been conducting constant reconnaissance and artillery exchanges for the past 24 hours. Axis forces have built strong defensive positions in the southwestern foothills of the main mountains that traverse the Mareth Line. British reconnaissance units are also very active in the area. Anglo-American air forces are flying over Tunisia, bombing the Gabès airfield and German positions on the Mareth Line. Air defenses on the Mareth Line have been strengthened in recent days, as even Allied aircrews acknowledge. Only reconnaissance fighting occurred throughout the day in the area west of the Ousseltia Valley.</p>
<h3>Naval Battle Occurs in the North Sea Straits; Nine Allied Ships Sunk by German Torpedo Boats</h3>
<p>Berlin, Seiyu News Agency Dispatch, 1st. Berlin announced in an official report that a naval battle occurred in the North Sea Straits on the night of February 26th. German motor torpedo boats sank three enemy freighters (totaling 6,500 tons), two escort ships, one supply ship, and three torpedoes. German submarines in the Atlantic and Mediterranean also sank three enemy freighters (totaling 19,000 tons) and one destroyer.</p>
<p>Swiss Capital, Havas Agency Dispatch, 28th. According to news released in Berlin, Allied ships lost in the Atlantic and Mediterranean during January and February of this year totaled over 1.1 million tons. Of these, 568,000 tons of British and American ships were destroyed by Axis submarines or air forces in February, an increase of 38,000 tons compared to February of last year. It is noted that February and March are traditionally seasons of heavy waves and fog, which are most unfavorable for submarine warfare. This is because submarines have difficulty operating during these three months, and the number of enemy ships sent to sea is also reduced due to the weather. However, the Axis powers were still able to achieve this result in January and February, which is truly remarkable.</p>
<h3>British Aircraft Attack Germany; French, Belgian, and Dutch Territories Also Bombed</h3>
<p>Swiss Capital, Havas Agency Dispatch, 28th. According to news from both the Anglo-American and Axis sides, air battles were very active over Western Europe yesterday.

<h3>Recent European Conditions and Turkish Movements: A Dialogue</h3>
<p>— By Yoshihide Maeda and Masao Maruyama of the Asahi Shimbun</p>
<p>Neutral Countries Are Not as Well Off as Belligerent Nations</p>
<p>Maruyama: First of all, I would like to hear your impressions of Europe, which is currently engulfed in war.</p>
<p>Maeda: Putting aside Britain, which is currently engaged in combat, what is most striking about Europe recently is that the people of neutral countries are living in even more dire straits than those of belligerent countries. For example, in Turkey, during the First European War, even though it was helping Germany in the war, each person's daily ration was 300 grams of bread. However, in this war, even though it is a neutral country outside the vortex of war, the maximum daily ration per person is only 250 grams. This means that the situation is worsening. Take Switzerland, for example. It is now impossible to even take a single scarf abroad, and customs officials will even confiscate it. However, this was not the case in the last war. A black market for goods is prevalent throughout Portugal, and alcohol has long since disappeared in Sweden. Given this situation, from the perspective of prices, the inflation in neutral countries is far greater than in belligerent countries.</p>
<p>In short, based on the experience of the last war, the belligerent countries in the vortex of this war had already completed a new economic system before the war began. Therefore, once the war started, they could maintain the original economic form for a considerable period of time. This is the reason why the economic situation in belligerent countries is better than in neutral countries. Greece's economic situation and the lives of its citizens are probably the most difficult in Europe. The fact that neutral countries are worse off than belligerent countries is a phenomenon that has only become particularly clear in Europe recently.</p>
<p>Maruyama: What is the situation with soaring prices and the black market?</p>
<p>Maeda: For example, in Portugal, ships also arrive from Britain, and transport planes come and go every day. Newspapers published in London can be seen the next day. In such a country, a bottle of whiskey that cost only two or three dollars before the war now costs over two hundred dollars. Regarding gasoline, although rationing is universally implemented, taxis absolutely will not sell gasoline unless they are paid three or four times the set price. Before the war, a suit cost only sixty or seventy dollars, but now it is impossible to make one even for three hundred dollars.</p>
<p>The same is true from the perspective of the people's emotions. The people of belligerent countries are determined to win, and everyone is working hard to a greater or lesser extent. However, the people of neutral countries were initially indifferent to the question of who would win, but now they understand that it is impossible to remain completely neutral, so everyone is worried about being drawn into the war. From this perspective of people's emotions, neutral countries are also more unstable than belligerent countries.</p>
<p>For example, in Turkey, whether it is Wilkie's visit from the United States or Ambassador Papen's return from Germany, whether it is the Soviet ambassador returning home for consultations or Churchill seeking an audience with the president, these kinds of special psychological warfare all cause fluctuations in the psychology of the Turkish people. The economic situation, of course, also changes rapidly.</p>
<p>Maruyama: What other impressions do you have? Please tell me even trivial details.</p>
<p>Maeda: To use the phrase "honoring women and slighting men," the way European women are respected may be appropriate. The fact that these pampered women are participating in production in large numbers is truly a remarkable thing. Most of the conductors on streetcars have become women, and most of the messenger jobs have also become women's occupations.</p>
<p>Maruyama: Among the neutral countries, I think Turkey and Spain are the most important. The movements of these two countries have a great impact on the future of the entire war. Therefore, I would like to hear about the recent movements of Turkey and Spain.</p>
<p>The Concept of Neutrality Varies from Country to Country</p>
<p>Maeda: The situation there is generally as you described, but Spain's and Turkey's concepts of neutrality are slightly different. Since the end of the Spanish Civil War, under Franco's leadership, Spain has, in principle, completely sided with the Axis powers. This is true in terms of both ideology and policy. Turkey is different. If we look closely at this war and Turkey's position, we can see that Turkey, like Spain, is trying to avoid being drawn into the war as much as possible. In this respect, the two have the same position.</p>
<p>Spain has not yet unified the country, which means it has not reached the point of participating in the war. Although it was the revolution under Franco's leadership that struck down communist policies, those who supported Franco were the landowners, Catholics, the old nobility, and a part of the army and navy. From the perspective of the Spanish royal family, they are very close to the British. Franco's Falange Party had to compromise with the royalists in order to end the civil war. The Falange Party's uniform used to be a dark blue cap, but after the compromise, the clothes remained dark blue, but the cap was changed to red, which was the royalist's cap. Given this situation, many of Franco's supporters, generally speaking, even if they are not pro-British, do not want to fight Britain. They have always maintained friendly relations. This is the subtle point at the moment.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Turkey was Germany's ally in the First European War and fought Britain to the death. Later, the revolution under General Kemal completed its goal by driving the Anglo-Greek Allied forces out of the country. According to recent Turkish public opinion, especially with the Anglo-American landings in North Africa and the British army's advance in Libya, Turkey and Spain, which have a great relationship with the Mediterranean, are getting closer to Britain. This is the difference between the current situation in Turkey and Spain.</p>
<p>Maruyama: Although the desire to maintain neutrality is clear, the country occupies an important strategic position in the world war, and perhaps objective circumstances will force it to abandon its neutral stance. I always think that these objective circumstances are gradually approaching.</p>
<p>Maeda: I think so too.</p>
<p>The Situation in the Near East is Worthy of Attention</p>
<p>Maruyama: I think Turkey's movements are even more important. Regarding this, the two Anglo-American giants recently met at the Casablanca Conference.</p>
<p>Assuming that Turkey takes a free position, then when Germany starts its spring offensive on the Eastern Front again, it will not have to do as before, moving troops from the North Caucasus and then crossing the steep and dangerous Greater Caucasus Mountains to invade the South Caucasus, and then expand its power in the Near East. Rather than taking such a difficult and long path, it would be better to pass through Turkey in order to achieve the purpose of this war—at a minimum, one of the purposes could be said to be to obtain the rich oil fields in the Near East that supply fuel to the Mediterranean fleet, and to obtain important economic and geographical strongholds to control the Near East, which is the base of British. I think this is always easier...</p>
<p>Maeda: It can be said that way. Perhaps Germany's highest ideal in this war is not limited to winning the war, not limited to establishing a new European order, but, as stipulated in the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, Japan strives for a new order in East Asia, Germany and Italy actively pursue a new order in Europe, and then unite into one, and then establish the highest goal of a new world order. Thinking of this point, Turkey should decide its attitude as soon as possible. Once it is decided, it will be much easier for Germany to join forces with Japan to establish a new order.</p>
<p>Maruyama: This is the biggest difference from the last World War. If we consider the organic combination of the Greater East Asia War and the European War on such a global scale, we can understand the different significance of this war. In addition, the route of the war and the direction of the operations are also different from the last World War. From this perspective, I think the Near East is very important.</p>
<p>Maeda: That's right. Also, the religions of Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kwait, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, Egypt, and other countries in the Near East, although they have many sources, are all generally Islamic. And Turkey is the country that possesses the last Islamic caliph. Because the Islamic caliph is in Turkey, if Turkey joins the Axis camp, then at least the Muslims in the Near East will tend to side with the Axis powers. The largest Muslim country is, in any case, Turkey. Next, it is Egypt. Kwait, because of its relationship with the Mecca caliph, claims the right to succeed the Islamic caliph, but according to its national power, it is not worth mentioning. During the First European War, the Turkish army also penetrated deep into Kwait's territory.</p>
<p>From this point of view, Turkey's early decision on its attitude can also lead to an early decision on the Near East issue, which is part of Germany's establishment of a new world order. In this sense, there may be optimistic possibilities. I think it can be said that way.</p>
<p>The Behind-the-Scenes Diplomatic Maneuvering Cannot Be Ignored</p>
<p>Maruyama: Turkey seems to have fairly close economic relations with various countries. Generally speaking, the Axis powers account for 40 percent, and the British and American side accounts for 60 percent...</p>
<p>Maeda: Last spring, the Axis powers occupied almost 80 percent. The reason is that when General Rommel invaded Egypt, British goods were almost cut off. Therefore, they hastily concluded new commercial agreements with Germany, Romania, Bulgaria, and other countries. From this fact, it can be seen that at one time, Turkey had a higher degree of economic relations with the Axis countries.</p>
<p>But one thing is very interesting. The United States is quite childish. When a big or unfavorable problem arises, Churchill and Roosevelt always meet to discuss it, but they do not talk to Britain about their own diplomatic work. This fully demonstrates a lack of cooperation. This may reflect the history of a country, because the United States is still young and too impatient. With regard to Turkey, Stettinius also has this style. Therefore, British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen certainly could not miss the opportunity. He returned home for consultations at the end of last year. I think he will definitely return to his post with Churchill this time.</p>
<p>Maruyama: Please tell us a story about Wilkie's visit to Turkey!</p>
<p>Maeda: Last autumn, Wilkie's visit to Moscow and Chongqing was the main purpose, but when he arrived in Egypt and Cairo, he asked Stettinius to introduce him to Turkey. So at the reception for reporters in Cairo, he said the following sentence: "This time, I am bringing a message from Roosevelt to Turkish President İsmet." Generally speaking, there are no messages in letters. This is just because when he left Washington, he did not have a plan to visit Turkey.</p>
<p>The Turkish Foreign Ministry, which saw through his deception, not only had many doubts, but even President İsmet was furious and said, even if it is a message, if he brought such a message, why did he not tell the Turkish ambassador to the United States directly in Washington? Why did Wilkie make a special trip to Turkey with such effort and without prior notice? If that is the case, then there is no need to meet, and Prime Minister Saraçoğlu also did not need to receive him. Therefore, he went to inspect the Soviet border with Prime Minister Saraçoğlu. Then he told the Foreign Minister to convey his regards. Wilkie, as usual, landed triumphantly at Ankara Airport by plane, but the only person who came to greet him was a secretary from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Protocol Department. After that, no one came. This situation, of course, caused resentment. Later, after Stettinius's persuasion, with great effort, Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu and the Deputy Chief of Staff agreed to meet. However, if he said goodbye like this, it would not only affect Wilkie's personal reputation, but also the reputation of the entire United States, so Stettinius invited the Foreign Minister to lunch to talk in detail. In Turkey, everyone thought it would stop there, but on the night before Wilkie's departure, at ten o'clock, Prime Minister Saraçoğlu returned to Ankara and talked for only an hour and a half. Although this method of reception seems to be flattering on the surface, in reality, the United States was subjected to the utmost cynicism by the diplomatic corps and journalists.</p>
<p>Maruyama: That would be according to the usual Turkish diplomatic season,...</p>
<p>Maeda: Because it was early September, it was the time to be pro-Axis, and it was also the season to approach being pro-British and American.</p>
<p>Maruyama: From various points of view, occupying North Africa, especially the line from the Near East to India, may play a decisive role, and the key to this line lies in Turkey, so Turkey is also gradually approaching the time to decide its final attitude. We also need to handle this Turkey issue well.</p>

<h3>Major Staple Food Distribution Measures: Issuance of Five Types of Purchase Certificates; Coarse Grains to Be Purchased at Designated Rice Shops; List of Retail Oil Shops Announced</h3>
<p>The plan to distribute sugar and cooking oil based on the number of family members, with the first step being the issuance of purchase certificates, has already been put into effect. The Public Concession, along with the Hongkou District's rice purchase certificate issuance offices, starting yesterday, universally issued five types of purchase certificates to taxpayers: (1) the eighth batch of rice purchase certificates, (2) flour purchase certificates, (3) sugar purchase certificates, (4) coarse grain purchase certificates, and (5) cooking oil purchase certificates. The method for taxpayers to purchase rice and flour certificates is to distribute them equally to residents residing in each household unit, based on the number of family members.</p>
<p>Coarse Grain and Oil Certificates Reissued Starting Yesterday</p>
<p>Of the five types of purchase certificates issued yesterday, the rice and flour purchase certificates and sugar purchase certificates had already begun to be issued on February 22nd. The cooking oil purchase certificates and coarse grain purchase certificates were reissued for the first time yesterday due to printing delays. These two types of purchase certificates each consist of two coupons, printed on a single sheet. From top to bottom, the first two coupons are for purchasing coarse grains, and the bottom two coupons are for purchasing cooking oil. All are printed in blue. Their size and format are completely identical to the sugar purchase certificates, except that coarse grain purchase certificates are designated to be used at retail rice shops, and cooking oil purchase certificates are designated to be used at retail oil shops.</p>
<p>Only Two Days to Reclaim</p>
<p>According to reporter inquiries, starting yesterday, rice purchase certificate offices in each district will issue all five types of purchase certificates together, and the designated issuance period will last until the 9th of this month. Therefore, all taxpayers should claim them before the deadline. For those who only claimed rice and flour purchase certificates and sugar purchase certificates before yesterday, the Materials Control Office has designated the 11th and 12th as the two days to reclaim cooking oil purchase certificates and coarse grain purchase certificates. Those who claim certificates at the racecourse at Ma Huoza should go to reclaim them on the 11th, and those who claim certificates at other offices should go to reclaim them on the 12th.</p>

<h3>Secretary of the Shanghai Indian Association on 12-Day Hunger Strike</h3>

Yesterday marked the twelfth day. A reporter specially visited Mr. Momtani for about half an hour. Mr. Momtani was in good spirits. He said that people around the world are deeply indignant at the British imperialist's brutal oppression of India, and are even more sympathetic to this arrest and hunger strike of Gandhi. The 300 million people of India are determined to fight until they defeat Britain. Gandhi's hunger strike has two days left, and his hunger strike will expire at 12:00 on the 4th of this month. He went on to say that the most painful thing in life is hunger strike, so those who are on hunger strike are expressing that their fellow Indians who are struggling under British oppression should be unyielding and continue to struggle.</p>
<h3>Second Neighborhood People's Flour in West Shanghai Sells for $3.60 Per *Liang*</h3>

<h3>*Shen Bao* Readers' Student Aid Fund: Fourth Session Income and Expenditure Report; Yao Family Primary School Aid Fund Separately Established Under Committee Management; Students Who Have Not Yet Received Aid Must Claim It Before the Deadline</h3>
<p>The fourth session of the *Shen Bao* Readers' Student Aid Fund began on January 15th. By the end of February, the screening and distribution of aid to over 2,600 applicant students had been largely completed. This session benefited from the generous donations of people from all walks of life, enabling poor students to continue their studies, for which we are deeply grateful. The income and expenditure overview of this session of the student aid fund (as of the end of February) is listed in the public announcement. Under the expenditure item, the allocation to the Yao Family Primary School Aid Fund Committee is the gift money received by this newspaper last year on behalf of the late Mrs. Yao Zhao under her will to aid students. Based on the Yao brothers' intention of eternal commemoration, this newspaper, in consultation with the *Xinwen Bao* social service column (which also received Yao family gift money at the same time) and the Yao brothers, decided to hire Mr. Ye Fuxiao and others to form a committee to submit all the gift money received by the two newspapers to the bank for special deposit and use for student aid. The handling of student aid matters by the committee will be announced separately by the committee. We hope that the gentlemen who sent gifts for student aid will supervise. This newspaper would like to express its sincere gratitude to all sectors.</p>
<p>*Shen Bao* Readers' Student Aid Fund Fourth Session Income and Expenditure Report, February 28, 1943</p>
<p>Remarks: (1) The balance from the previous session was originally $79.64.38. Later, students whose aid had been approved in the previous session but not received requested it, so after the bank sent the statement, a total of $2,432.00 was paid to 15 people, hence the balance as shown in the table.</p>
<p>(2) The number of students who were approved for aid but automatically canceled their aid is the balance as of February 28th.</p>
<p>(3) The total balance in this table is calculated based on the issued checks.</p>
<p>*Shen Bao* Readers' Student Aid Fund Fourth Session Report, Spring 1943</p>
<p>Note: (1) A total of 65 people automatically canceled after approval, totaling $9,585, which has not yet been included.</p>
<p>(2) Two disaster-stricken children are included in the junior high school category.</p>
<p>Please Expedite Cashing of Aid Fund Checks From This Newspaper by All Schools</p>
<p>The aid fund expenditure in the above table is based on the amount of checks issued by this session as of the end of last month. There are still several students who have not claimed their checks. It is hoped that the students will claim them according to the regulations before the 5th. Failure to claim them by the deadline will be regarded as the student voluntarily giving up. In addition, it is also hoped that the checks with the heading of this newspaper's student aid fund received by each school will be cashed at the bank as soon as possible so that the expenditure of this session's aid fund can be fully settled.</p>
<p>Aid Received Yesterday</p>
<p>The student aid fund received yesterday was $350 from Li Ji, $150 from Zhong Ji, and $120 from Shen Yan (refund of aid), for a total of $620 in received vouchers. The remaining balance is $473,670.05.2 (The "five" character was accidentally added to the $50 in yesterday's balance, and the correction is made urgently.)</p>
<h3>Municipal Economic Bureau Formally Established Yesterday; Policy Guidelines Announced; Bureau Director Wang Zhigang's Inaugural Address</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Economic Bureau was formally established yesterday (the 1st) at 10:00 AM at the original site of the Social Bureau after Wang Zhigang was appointed as the bureau director by the National Government. The Social Bureau was closed and ceased operations yesterday, and all economic and industrial and commercial matters under the jurisdiction of the Social Bureau were transferred to the Economic Bureau for acceptance and handling from that day onward.</p>
<p>Appointment of Personnel</p>
<p>Economic Bureau Director Wang Zhigang arrived at the bureau at 10:00 AM to take office. After the acceptance of all economic and industrial and commercial matters was completed, he immediately announced the appointment of Wu Yinguang as acting secretary, Xi Youxin as acting head of the first section, Wu Baoheng to temporarily take charge of general affairs, Zhou Zhiping to temporarily take charge of receiving and dispatching affairs, and section member Chen Yunzhong to handle seal supervision affairs.</p>
<p>Inaugural Address</p>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter specially visited the bureau. Director Wang released the following remarks: "I was previously appointed by the National Government as a member of the Zhejiang Provincial Government and director of the Construction Department. I felt that I was already overwhelmed by my duties. Now, I have been ordered to transfer to head the Municipal Economic Bureau, and I am even more apprehensive because of my lack of ability. I am deeply concerned about overstepping my abilities. Fortunately, in the Shanghai area, the economic administrative system and policies have been established and mostly implemented under the leadership and supervision of Mayor Chen in the past, and with the cooperation of friendly countries and local elders. After I take office, in addition to complying with the wartime economic policy guidelines promulgated by the National Government, for the five key points of increasing production, regulating prices, economizing on consumption, stabilizing currency value, and reforming the organization, I will certainly follow Mayor Chen's intentions, solicit opinions from all sides, and weigh the pros and cons according to the actual economic situation in the past and the actual needs in the wartime economic environment after entering the war, distinguish between priorities, and promote and implement them step by step, to implement the wartime economic policy and complete the wartime economic construction. As for the policy guidelines after the establishment of this bureau, because this city is the economic center of the country and the economic organization is extremely complex, it will be difficult to formulate detailed and accurate policy plans without a considerable period of time for careful review. At the beginning of the establishment of this bureau, regarding the work part, currently, we must first seek the soundness of the organizational structure and the rationality of personnel distribution of this bureau, so that all work plans can be gradually promoted and implemented in stages in the future. In short, the most important link in administrative work during wartime is that if the wartime economy is consolidated, the people's livelihood can be stabilized. If the people's livelihood is stable, they can work hard to produce. If production increases, the combat power will be enriched and can be sustained. Therefore, the wartime economic policy is very broad. I am ordered to handle the economic work of this city at this time as a member of the wartime economy, and I feel more strongly the importance of my mission. In the future, I will supervise all my colleagues in this bureau to work hard in their respective positions with a new spirit and do their best to fully exert the efficiency of our work in order to strive for the practical results of our work. I deeply hope that all relevant parties in friendly countries will closely cooperate and that leaders from all sectors of industry, commerce, finance, and the city's people will unanimously support, work together, and discuss the way forward. I believe that there will be no difficulties in the future."</p>
<h3>Battery Exchange Purchase Implemented in the City; Price Reduced; Certificate Required for Purchase; Used Batteries Collected and Returned to Factory</h3>
<p>Starting yesterday (the 1st), all electrical appliance shops in the city are implementing an exchange purchase method for used dry cell batteries and new batteries, and have posted signs stating "Protect Resources, Recycle Waste" and explaining that purchasers of dry cell batteries must bring used dry cell batteries to the store for exchange purchase. A certificate of need must be filled out. The price has increased by about one-fifth for customers since the exchange method was implemented. The shops will also collect the used batteries, list them, and send them to the factory to request delivery of new batteries.</p>
<h3>Pawnshop Industry Association States Scope of Pawnshop Industry</h3>
<p>According to the Pawnshop Industry Association to a Datong News Agency reporter yesterday, pawnshops that have been cracked down on in the Chinese area for exploiting with usurious interest are not members of the association. Most of these small pawnshops are located around gambling dens, and the interest rates are arbitrarily set. The pawn period is shortened to two months or one month. In addition, many small pawnshops also engage in the side business of pawn tickets, which is detrimental to the livelihood of the poor. The association hopes that the authorities will severely crack down on them. It also stated that "the total number of members of this association is about 500, all of whom operate in accordance with the regulations. If there is no citizen certificate, no pledges will be accepted."</p>

<h3>Replacement Period for Standard New Water Ladles Has Expired; Each Ladle Sells for One Corner of Reserve Certificates; Violators Will Be Dealt With According to the Regulations</h3>
<p>Regarding the matter that all boiled water shops in the city must replace their water ladles with standard water ladles, the Measurement and Calibration Institute of the Social Bureau and the Boiling Water Shop Industry Association of this city have handled the matter separately. The replacement period expired the day before yesterday, and replacement has now stopped. However, according to the association yesterday, all members who have already replaced them must sell water with the new water ladles, selling each ladle for one corner of central reserve certificates.

<p>Yu Yincai, a native of Ningbo, attempted to rob the Japanese-owned Songyong Clock Company at 1287 North Sichuan Road on Lunar New Year's Eve last year.

<h3>Youyou Orphanage Lacks Food</h3>
<p>The Youyou Orphanage in this city houses a large number of children and is one of the charitable organizations in the urban area. Recently, due to the difficulty of food and supplies, the orphanage could not bear to see the children suffering from hunger, so it specially submitted a request to the Municipal Social Bureau to ask the Grain Bureau to find ways to purchase a small amount of broken wheat or miscellaneous grains from the four suburbs of the city to fill their stomachs and alleviate the serious threat of food shortage. After receiving the request, the Social Bureau immediately transferred it to the Municipal Grain Administration for handling.</p>

<h3>The Final Method for Per Capita Sugar Distribution Awaits Approval from the Military Allocation Authorities; Sugar Market to Be Re-registered and Handled by District; The Listed Names Are Only Temporary in Nature</h3>
<p>Cooperative Sugar Business: In preparation for the implementation of per capita sugar distribution, agreement has been reached with the military allocation authorities to implement it from March 11. All distribution methods have been decided and will be publicly announced at that time. The re-registration of all Category A retailers has been completed, and the city has been divided into seven districts. All Category A retailers have been merged and filled out "Applications for Sales of Household Sugar." They have been reviewed and compiled separately, with 14 bags of sugar per month allocated to each group. After the merger, each group is given a registration number. Those with 100 bags of sugar allocated per month include as many as seven groups. The final method, detailed list, and addresses with numbers will be announced after the compilation is completed and approved by the military allocation authorities. As for the retailers handling household sugar in the Concession authorities, the standards compiled by the cooperative will also be used. The list of retailers currently distributed to each sugar collection certificate is actually a temporary provision.</p>
<p>Re-registration, Numbering and Registration</p>
<p>In order to strictly manage the sale of household sugar by retailers, the cooperative has ordered all retailers to prepare guarantees and re-register within the specified time limit. Those who fail to re-register within the time limit will have their qualifications as retailers cancelled. Retailers who have passed the cooperative's review will be designated as stores selling household sugar, and the cooperative will assign them numbers and re-register them for sales. Without the approval of the cooperative, sales may not be stopped midway. Retailers shall pay a deposit and borrow money on schedule to pick up goods from designated sugar firms. All previous methods of self-application for purchase will be abolished.</p>
<p>Selling Sugar with Certificates; Strict Management</p>
<p>Each retailer selling household sugar shall issue sugar to households with sugar purchase certificates in accordance with the sugar price, quantity, and sales date announced by the cooperative each period. When purchasing, the designated number and period should be verified. Retailers selling household sugar shall not have the following circumstances: (1) moving or hiding sugar without authorization and not selling it, (2) exceeding the limit price set by the cooperative, (3) deducting quantities or adulterating, (4) deliberately making things difficult for purchasers. The sugar purchase certificates received by each retailer must be properly pasted into a booklet for the cooperative's verification.</p>
<p>Tasks of Category B Retailers</p>
<p>Those who violate the cooperation will be punished according to the severity of the circumstances: (1) suspension of allocation for a certain number of days, (2) confiscation of the deposit, (3) permanent cancellation of sales qualification, (4) legal action by the authorities. Regarding Category B retailers who specialize in sugar needed for various industries, allocation will continue in the future. It is reported that the Category B retailers in the seven districts of the city will still be based on the previous registrants, and it is stipulated that the 23rd to 25th of each month will be the application period for Category B retailers, and the 5th to 20th of each month will be the father-in-law delivery date for sugar firms to sell sugar to retailers.</p>
<h3>City Police Bureau Staff Hold Morning Exercises</h3>
<p>Lu Ying, Deputy Commander of the Shanghai Special Municipality Security and Director of the City Police Bureau, in view of the current development of the "Purging the Countryside" movement, in addition to being responsible for maintaining local public order, also ordered his subordinates to practice clean police administration. In order to adapt to the current government's participation in the war system, strengthening the country first requires strengthening the body, and paying attention to physical education. Therefore, he ordered all staff members of the bureau's departments and teams to wear newly made uniforms to work from March 1st, and starting from 8:00 am yesterday morning, they began to hold morning exercises in the bureau's large parade ground.</p>
<h3>Impose Restrictions Through Taxation: City Finance Bureau Prepares to Levy a 10% Tax on Articles for Superstitious Activities</h3>
<p>Since ancient times, various superstitious activities have emerged among the people of our country, which not only hinder the development of education, but also waste time and money.

<h3>Commemorating the 9th March 3rd Friends' Day; Huang Jingwan Speaks</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is the 9th March 3rd Friends' Day. The initiator, Huang Jingwan, in view of the current difficult times, believes that it is not appropriate to make any extravagant displays. Yesterday, he made a statement to reporters, saying, "A person cannot be without friends, but the quality of friends is very different. Good friends benefit you for life. As the ancients said, 'Having one confidant is enough.' Because confidants help you with your knowledge, morality, career, and even temporary emergencies. But making bad friends is extremely harmful. Many degenerate people in society are often influenced by bad friends. Confucius said, 'There are three kinds of beneficial friends and three kinds of harmful friends.' But how to distinguish between benefit and harm is truly 'human hearts are difficult to fathom, more difficult than knowing the heavens.' It all depends on your own ability to judge and unwavering will. Then good influences can be felt, and bad influences will not invade. At the same time, various bad habits, such as smoking, drinking, prostitution, gambling, etc., must be resolutely corrected. The ancients said, 'Take the good and follow it,' which is really the best compass for making friends. Everyone should value justice and not fight for power and pleasure. Friends should not daydream. To improve society, the first step is to improve the relationship between friends. Everyone should shoulder the responsibility of morality, do their best, help each other, share joys and sorrows, and establish a guarantee of equal personality in order to adapt to the coming of the new era. As for other ways of friendship, I have given many speeches and writings in the past, so I don't want to say more today. Fortunately, everyone can experience it for themselves. Finally, I hope that everyone will abide by the friendly teachings of etiquette, righteousness, loyalty, and trustworthiness, and become good friends."</p>
<h3>Customs Intensifies Anti-Smuggling Efforts and Solves Two More Cases</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs previously carried out large-scale anti-smuggling operations to combat smuggling and achieved remarkable results. It is now learned that the customs' anti-smuggling unit has continued its efforts, and the evil trend of smuggling seems to have subsided. The details of the two additional cases of smuggled goods seized by the customs are recorded as follows: (1) A case of artificial silk clothing made by a foreigner, Mrs. Tao Ge, was fined 1,548 yuan and import duties were paid; (2) A case of toys and groceries from Yongkang Company was fined 350 yuan. All of the goods were detained by the unit. However, the owner of the goods must pay the fine in full within one month, otherwise the detained goods will be confiscated.</p>
<h3>Hankou and Jiujiang Postal Remittances Resume; Each Remittance Limited to 50 Yuan</h3>
<p>According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the Shanghai Postal Administration has decided to resume postal remittances to Hankou and Jiujiang. It is expected that the resumption of remittances will be announced to all postal branches in this city, and the public can immediately accept remittances to the above two places. However, the amount is limited, and each remittance is limited to a maximum of 50 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates.</p>
<h3>Authorities of the Two Concessions Supervise the Quality of Food in Vegetable Markets; They May Order Vendors to Purchase Specially Made Standard Weighing Instruments; Strict Prohibition of Rotten Food Entering as the Weather Turns Warmer</h3>
<p>The authorities of the Public Works Department and the French Municipal Council are paying close attention to the management of vegetable markets in various districts, in addition to prices, including quantity and quality.</p>
<p>Strict Prevention of the Use of Inaccurate Weighing Instruments</p>
<p>It is reported that since the authorities have implemented price limits in vegetable markets as much as possible, it has been found that some vendors often feign compliance. Although they nominally sell goods to customers at or near the price limit, they actually use inaccurate weighing instruments to secretly deduct quantities to deceive customers and investigators. Therefore, in order to avoid this malpractice, the authorities have sent personnel to specifically review the weighing instruments used in vegetable markets. It is also reported that when necessary, the authorities will invite experts to make a standard weighing instrument, which will be ordered by the authorities for vendors to purchase, in order to standardize the weighing of vegetable markets in various districts and prevent vendors from cheating.</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Food Hygiene Issues</p>
<p>At the same time, it has been learned from reporters that the health departments of the two concessions believe that the season has entered warm spring, and some rotten food may be mixed into the vegetable markets for sale. Therefore, a group of inspectors has been dispatched to work in the vegetable markets. Once it is found that fresh meat is sold without a stamp, the vendor will be subject to the revocation of the license. The health department authorities also, in view of the prevalence of epidemics last summer, have implemented strict inquiries into the sources of various foods in vegetable markets, and have carried out the most detailed inspections. In addition to directly managing the cleanliness and inspection of food in vegetable markets, the health department authorities also hope that residents will pay attention to food hygiene issues.</p>

<h3>Record of East India's Vicissitudes (2)</h3>
<p>— Qiao Song</p>
<p>Central Political Separate Internal Affairs, Education, Religion, Transportation, Civil Engineering, Finance, Judiciary, Economy, Army, and Navy have eight departments, each with a minister. Except for the two ministers of the Army and Navy appointed by the King, the rest are appointed by the Governor-General. Local administration is divided into three provinces and nineteen states. Provinces have governors, and states have governors and administrative officers to rule the local areas.</p>
<p>The Dutch East Indies Council is composed of a vice-chairman and four to six members appointed by the King to provide consultation to the Governor-General on specified matters. However, the power of decision rests with the Governor-General, who is the ex-officio chairman at any time.</p>
<p>(III) Judiciary: The Governor-General has the power to grant pardons after hearing the opinion of the President of the High Court. For places that recognize the jurisdiction of native chiefs and chieftains, the Dutch East Indies Council also has the power to grant amnesty or abolish it.</p>
<p>The highest court is the Supreme Court, and the local courts include provincial courts, administrative state courts, native administrative state courts, county courts, and monastic courts.</p>
<p>The financial system is decided by the Governor-General after being passed by the People's Council and then approved by the Dutch Parliament.</p>
<p>Before the First European War, the financial situation did not have any serious problems. After the outbreak of the war, the budget expanded and the revenue shortfall increased year by year. From 1924, after many efforts, it improved slightly. However, it deteriorated again during the global economic panic in 1929, and the finances were in a precarious state. In recent years, with rising prices, revenue has increased, and the situation has been slightly optimistic, but it reversed again before the Second World War. The revenue and expenditure amounts after 1930 are as follows (unit: thousand shields):</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies National Debt (thousand shields)</p>
<p>The above figures are based on "New Knowledge of Nanyang" written by Yoshitaka Wada.</p>
<p>(III) Wealthy Resources</p>
<p>Although East India has had the painful fate of being a colony for hundreds of years and has suffered the ruthless exploitation and plunder of the colonial authorities, it is still a treasure house of Nanyang and a major resource area in the world. Especially during wartime, who would not envy its production of oil, tin, and rubber?</p>
<p>However, only a part of East India's resources has been developed so far. The vast East Indian archipelago has not been correctly surveyed for the actual situation of resources, and there is more that has not been developed. What has been discovered below is naturally only the part that is already known.</p>
<p>(A) Agricultural Resources: East India is almost entirely agricultural land. Due to the vastness of the area, the strong sunlight and abundant rainfall unique to the tropics, the Dutch colonial policy has particularly focused on agriculture in East India, focusing on the large-scale production of rubber trees, quinine, sugarcane, tea, coffee, cocoa, tobacco, coconuts, rice, corn, kapok, pepper, palm oil trees, cassava (the roots can be made into starch and bread), and other plants. Some of these are East India's exclusive products, and some are world commodities that are sold to the world. Due to the utilization of these resources, East India enjoys economic prosperity. Please see the current status of East India's agricultural products:</p>
<p>Production of Major Agricultural Products (unit: thousand metric tons)</p>
<p>Figures are based on the table above</p>
<p>Among them, raw rubber ranks second only to the former British Malaya and is the second largest producer in the world, supplying a quarter of the world's needs. The rubber industry has become the most developed sector in East India's industry. In particular, all the rubber refining factories in Sumatra are large-scale capitalist operations, and in recent years, they have been encroaching on British Malaya.</p>
<p>Quinine is a special product of East India, supplying 90% of the world's needs. The East Indian government has operated government-managed quinine farms for this exclusive product, controlling its dominance. Pepper, palm oil, and kapok are also East India's exclusive products.</p>
<p>Sugarcane supplies 8% of the world's production. Sugarcane fields are mostly located in eastern and central Java and are attached to sugar refineries, operating on a capitalist basis. Almost all of their capital is Dutch capital.</p>
<p>Tea is produced everywhere in Java and Sumatra, accounting for 16% of the world's production. The tea industry has been particularly developed in recent years. Dutch, British, and American capital are very active in the tea industry. Overseas Chinese and Japanese also have some tea plantations.</p>
<p>Coffee production accounts for 5% of the world's production. Tobacco production has not been very developed in recent years, and its main production area is the Deli region of Sumatra.</p>
<p>The above is the production of world commodities and is operated with large capital. The most foreign investment is in rubber, with British, American, French, and Belgian capital accounting for half; coconut oil, coffee, tea, and quinine also have a considerable amount of foreign capital invested. Other coconut copra, rice, corn, etc. are still stuck in the "aboriginal agriculture" form, with the domestic market as the main target.</p>

<h3>West Union Football This Week's Schedule: Donghua Reunites with St. Francis; Lianyi Meets Portuguese Businessmen Again on Saturday</h3>
<p>The West Union Football this week's schedule was announced yesterday by the secretariat. There are three matches in the second round of Group A. On Saturday (6th), Lianyi will play against Portuguese Businessmen again, at 3:45 pm at Jiaozhou Park. The two teams drew 3-3 in the first round. This time, the Portuguese Businessmen's lineup is fragmented and their combat power is weakened, while Lianyi just defeated the Italian army last week and their momentum is strong, so the hope of victory is high. On Sunday (7th), there are two Group A matches. Donghua will reunite with St. Francis, also competing at Jiaozhou Park at 3:15 pm. In the first round, the two sides fought exceptionally brilliantly, and Donghua won 5-3. However, in the Shi Cup final, Donghua was poisoned due to rain. This time, the narrow road to vendetta is the third battle. Donghua can originally recreate the victory, but the St. team won the Shi Cup championship and broke the Portuguese businessmen 3-1 in the previous week, while Donghua only won the Portuguese businessmen by one goal, so it is impossible to be too optimistic. At that time, a fierce competition between the two sides will be inevitable. In addition, the Sino-Western charity football match organized by the West Union, Hualian vs. the Italian-Portuguese Allied Forces, has been postponed repeatedly due to rain. Yesterday, according to the announcement of the organizer, this match has been decided to be cancelled. Those who pre-purchased tickets are requested to bring the tickets to the West Union Branch Office in Hualian Weaving Factory, 3 Yong'an Street, to refund the tickets before next Thursday (11th). No late refunds will be allowed. In the C Group League match last week, Hequn defeated the Philippines 3-0. The schedule for this week is recorded below:</p>

<h3>A New Special Yen System: Its Future Relationship to Chinese Commerce and Finance</h3>
<p>Two weeks ago, it was reported that Japan is soon to establish a Trading Corporation, which will become the "sole controlling body for Japan's foreign trade," and whose current task is to study the application of the special yen system. This news is of extreme importance and must be fully understood.</p>
<p>According to the statement of Mr. Shōtarō Ishiwatari, the supreme economic advisor to the National Government, the ratio of the special yen has no relation to the current exchange rate of 18 military yen to 1 Central Reserve Bank note (CRB). From this, it seems that, for example, if goods from the Shanghai area are transported to another area within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the price is 1,000 special yen, the amount of CRB notes it represents may not be 5,500 CRB notes, but a number exceeding 5,500 CRB notes. Conversely, if the value of goods is 5,500 yuan, it would be equivalent to 1,000 military yen, but if converted into special yen, it may be less than this amount. However, with 1,000 military yen, one cannot purchase any goods in Japan, but with special yen (1,000 yen or a relatively smaller amount), one can.</p>
<p>The special yen is a special currency system within the entire Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, but the CRB note and the United Reserve Bank note do not lose their own status because of this. Their own status can not only be strengthened but also be self-sufficient. Because Mr. Ishiwatari said that after the transferred enemy property is handed over to the Central Reserve Bank, it can further strengthen the foundation of the Central Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>Speaking of the CRB note, the government authorities have repeatedly stated that they must establish its own status. All rumors, propaganda, and worries that the CRB note will be replaced by a new currency can be said to be completely unfounded. Not only is there absolutely no possibility of changing the CRB note, but also the promotion of the CRB note in Central China has reached an unprecedented extent. Of course, the nature of the CRB note is not all-encompassing. However, within China, it is the only currency in general circulation. As for the special yen, it is an appropriate currency designed to adapt to the environment and is specifically used for foreign trade.</p>
<p>This new monetary system can exercise powers that the original monetary system could not. The great economist Ricardo believed that the most complete currency was paper money. However, the development of modern monetary systems has reached an even more advanced level, with one type of fixed currency for domestic circulation and another type of fixed currency for foreign trade. The special yen is an example of the development of modern monetary systems.</p>
<p>The principle of a wartime economy lies in promoting the highest amount of production with the lowest amount of consumption. Therefore, the mission of currency is to enable it to promote production and, at the same time, limit its consumptive outflow. In short, the value of a wartime monetary system lies in its immediate liquidity, not in its peacetime conservatism. The state of monetary evolution that we have already reached, such as the creation of the special yen system, is a result of adapting to the times. It is not only worthy of our understanding, but also worthy of our support. (Translated by Yi Ren from the March 1st Times)</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Stabilizing Currency Value and Commodity Reserves</h3>
<p>In the recent outline of wartime economic policies announced by the government, regarding the stabilization of currency value, it is stated: "Monetary policy should be coordinated with the increase in productivity to seek the stability of currency value." This policy can be said to be a reflection of the latest monetary theory.</p>
<p>What is the new monetary theory? That is, the good and reasonable reserve for currency is not gold, silver, or foreign exchange, but various necessities that can directly satisfy people's daily life desires. In the past, the reason why countries used gold, silver, and foreign exchange as reserves for currency was nothing more than the belief that with gold, silver, and foreign exchange, they could obtain various necessities of life for survival. Now, after a long war, various materials are quite scarce, far less abundant and rich than before the war. Therefore, even with gold, silver, and foreign exchange, it is mostly impossible to exchange for materials. Gold, silver, and foreign exchange have become dead objects. For example, although the United States now possesses a large amount of gold and silver and a large amount of foreign exchange, it has no bearing on the acquisition of war materials. Therefore, commentators say, "Those who swallow gold are foolish men and women, and the country that swallows gold is the United States of North America under Roosevelt's dictatorship."</p>
<p>Minister of Finance Zhou of the National Government reported at the first meeting of the National Economic Committee held on the 12th of last month that the issuance reserves of the Central Reserve Bank at the end of last year included a cash reserve of slightly less than 2.6 billion yuan and a guarantee reserve of slightly less than 1.1 billion yuan. Therefore, the cash reserve often exceeded 70%, which was 10% higher than the statutory cash reserve ratio. Therefore, there is no possibility of any unsound expansion of the new legal tender. We, the common people, are very pleased with this practical report from Minister Zhou. However, in the current situation, the reserve for currency is not in the amount of cash, but in the abundance of daily necessities. If the Chinese and foreign authorities, both government and public, can henceforth focus on increasing the production of daily necessities, eliminate all difficulties hindering production, make prices tend to stabilize, and stabilize people's livelihood, and the purchasing power of the CRB note becomes increasingly strengthened, then we will surely prostrate ourselves in admiration.</p>
<h3>Northern Jiangsu is the Ukraine of Central China: Enhancing Agricultural Production Under the National Government's Rule</h3>
<p>When the Incident initially occurred, the Northern Jiangsu area was not valued in terms of culture or economy. However, as the Incident dragged on, the economy of Central China became important. Therefore, in the past two years, all parties have attached importance to the economy of Northern Jiangsu. The Northern Jiangsu region under the jurisdiction of the Northern Jiangsu Pacification Headquarters currently consists of only ten-odd counties, including Yancheng, Dongtai, Baoying, Hua, Gaoyou, Jiangdu, Yizheng, Taixian, Taixing, Rugao, Nantong, Jingjiang, Haimen, and Qidong, with an area about the size of Taiwan and a population of 12 million. The cultivated area is eight-tenths larger than that of Japan. The agricultural products produced include cotton, rice, wheat, soybeans, sorghum, corn, and many other miscellaneous grains. The southern area around Nantong and the Funing area produce cotton, the eastern coast produces salt, and the area along the Grand Canal produces wheat and miscellaneous grains. According to historical surveys and statistics, the products produced, in addition to local consumption, have a surplus to supply other places, with approximately 100,000 tons of wheat and 30,000 tons of rice available for export. This year's cotton production is estimated to reach 600,000 dan. Regarding the Northern Jiangsu production increase plan, according to investigations by relevant parties, if 200 million yen are invested, production can be increased more than threefold. Whether this can be fully realized is, of course, still a question. However, in enhancing agricultural production in Central China, Northern Jiangsu will inevitably occupy an extremely important position in the future. Therefore, this operation can not only ensure the Northern Jiangsu area militarily, but also achieve considerable success in economic construction in the near future, making a truly great contribution to the economy of Central China.

<h3>US-German Comparison of Export Trade to Spain</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Xianglin, 28th—A German Foreign Ministry spokesman stated yesterday at an information meeting that the US Ambassador to Spain, Hayes, gave a speech on Friday, in which he tried to avoid comparing US exports to Spain with German exports to Spain, attributing the small amount of US exports to Spain to difficulties in shipping. The spokesman then pointed out that Germany supplies Spain with coal worth 6 to 7 million pesetas annually. In addition, the Spanish State Railways receive 12,000 to 15,000 tons of German coal monthly. Therefore, US exports to Spain cannot be compared with those of Germany.</p>
<h3>US Shortage of Gasoline</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Lisbon, 28th—According to news from New York, the state of Connecticut in the United States is experiencing a shortage of fuel in the town of Hartford due to the disruption of oil transportation from Texas.</p>
<h3>US Opposition to Meat Imports</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Lisbon, 28th—According to news from Washington, US Senator Hatfield stated that US livestock breeders will oppose the import of meat from Argentina.</p>
<h3>The US "Wartime Minimum Living Plan": Newspapers Reduced to One-Fifth of 1939 Size</h3>
<p>The United States, a gold-rich country with an excess of gold, is experiencing poverty in its rear-area life due to excessive consumption of materials and insufficient domestic resource replenishment. Recently, the US War Production Board drafted a "Wartime Minimum Living Plan." Looking at its content, one can understand the recent situation in the United States.</p>
<p>Once this plan is implemented, the American people, accustomed to luxury, will inevitably feel hardship. It is said that the content of this plan, compared to the consumption level in 1941, will reduce food by 71.8%, beverages by 54.9%, clothing by 75.2%, and books and publications by 29.3%.</p>
<p>The size of newspapers will be reduced to one-fifth of its 1939 size. Movies and theater will also be restricted. The food shortage is the most serious, with the sale of all canned foods being stopped soon, and a ration system is being prepared. Therefore, on February 20th, a large number of customers rushed to grocery stores to buy canned foods, and the situation was extremely chaotic. As for the reasons for the decline in agricultural and forestry production, it is all due to conscription. At the same time, because military factories have raised wages, many farmers have successively left the countryside, either enlisting in the army or going to work in expensive military factories. In order to restore agricultural production, the agricultural and forestry departments have decided to allow factory workers to return to their hometowns to farm during the spring plowing and autumn harvest, and have also proposed an additional 80 million yuan in production incentives. However, the rural areas not only do not welcome this, but also say, "Money cannot be used to cultivate the land." They hope to raise the prices of agricultural products and hope that the authorities will provide agricultural tools. In short, the US authorities' approach is nothing more than trying to solve the food shortage for the army first. (March 1st, Mainland News)</p>
<h3>Barter Trade Between Argentina and Bolivia</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, February 27th—Bolivia has decided to supply Argentina with 250 tons of rubber in exchange for Argentine machinery to develop Bolivia's sugar industry. The barter agreement has already been held here.</p>
<h3>Considering Merger of Sino-Japanese Research Institutions in This City</h3>
<p>The National Economic Committee has established a research office to collect various production increase data to promote production. Since the outbreak of the China Incident and the Greater East Asia War, the research work in China and various regions within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has been greatly promoted. Currently, there is a Research Alliance in Japan, directly under the Cabinet, which manages all research matters. There is also the East Asia Research Institute, which conducts research on the politics, economy, and culture within the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The data researched by this institute is provided to the Planning Board as a reference for policy implementation. The Manchukuo government recently established the Manchukuo Research Institution Federation, which is under the jurisdiction of the Planning Department of the General Affairs Agency. It is scheduled to invite research personnel from China, Japan, and Manchukuo in late March to hold its first conference. The research work regarding China is under the jurisdiction of the Research Section of the Greater East Asia Ministry, and a Joint Association of Research Institutions for China has been established within the Greater East Asia Ministry to be responsible for guidance. Other research institutions include the Joint Association of Research Institutions in Mengjiang in Zhangjiakou, the Joint Committee for Research in North China in Beijing, the Joint Association of Research Institutions in Qingdao, the Liaison Council of Research Institutions in Wuhan in Hankou, the Joint Association of Research Institutions in Xiamen in Xiamen, and the Joint Committee for Research Institutions in Guangdong in Guangdong. The above research institutions are all under the command of the research officers of the embassies and consulates of the occupied areas. The research institutions of China, Japan, and Manchukuo are almost complete and will surely promote the political, economic, cultural, and ideological integration of China, Japan, and Manchukuo. The Sino-Japanese research institutions in Beijing have already merged and unified. Since the establishment of the research office by the National Economic Committee in Shanghai, it will also be able to promote unification. It is heard that the relevant authorities are considering taking the same measures as in Beijing and merging the Sino-Japanese research institutions to carry out unified operations.

<h3>Bank Deposit Amount Sets New Record Again</h3>
<p>The amount of deposits in various Chinese banks in this city has recently reached a new record again, with the total amount reaching 130 billion national currency (1,300,000,000). According to observers in the financial community yesterday, this is a manifestation of public trust in the Central Reserve Bank notes and a situation required by the National Government's wartime economic policies, because wartime economic policies require sound savings and oppose speculative activities. The same source stated: The current amount of deposits in various banks has exceeded the amount in any previous month. This fund is sufficient to promote industrial production and indicates that the floating capital used in the machinery industry has gradually entered the right track—a symbol of the progress of Shanghai's economic situation. (Translated from the March 1st Times)</p>
<h3>Registration Period for Merchants Dealing in Specially Taxed Goods Extended by One Month; Deadline is the 15th of This Month</h3>
<p>The Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance previously ordered that merchants dealing in six categories of specially taxed goods, including sugar, cosmetics, tung oil, tea, pig bristles, and poultry feathers, in various regions should apply for registration in accordance with regulations and that all applications should be submitted to the department before February 15th. Now that the registration deadline has passed, but a small number of merchants have not yet gone to register, the department has decided to extend the registration deadline to the 15th of this month out of consideration for the merchants.</p>
<p>Economic Translation and Discussion</p>
<h3>Thorough Countermeasures to Suppress and Stabilize Prices</h3>
<p>The price hikes of various commodities in Central China, especially necessities of life, are soaring every day, simply ignoring the authorities' policy of suppressing and stabilizing prices. The hope of controlling prices is more urgent than ever today. If it is allowed to develop , it will not only trap the people's livelihood in a desperate situation, but also undoubtedly pose a serious threat to the entire social economy. The responsibility of the authorities responsible for managing prices is of paramount importance.</p>
<p>The rise in prices is naturally caused by various complex reasons in Central China. It is not simply related to economic factors. Some are caused by psychological effects on prices. This psychological effect is not something that cannot be solved. It depends on the authorities' policies, and it is not difficult to eliminate it completely. However, thorough measures to suppress and stabilize prices have not yet been realized, so the price hikes continue unabated. The authorities responsible for managing prices need to give this point serious consideration.</p>
<p>What is the so-called psychological effect? In a word, it is blindly anticipating price increases. Believing that today is more expensive than yesterday, and tomorrow will definitely be more expensive than today, this concept is what makes people hoard and speculate. All funds are completely used for hoarding goods. This tendency has created today's skyrocketing prices. Therefore, the focus of price countermeasures must be to use strong measures to stabilize prices. If this policy can be thoroughly implemented, then prices will naturally stabilize. The so-called strong measures do not necessarily refer to legal sanctions. The meaning is to gather the financial magnates of the peaceful areas and make them cooperate in promoting the effort, and to engage influential talents in the community to assist in handling the matter. At the same time, with legal sanctions, it is believed that its effectiveness will not be small.</p>
<p>If prices are subject to strict restrictions, most speculators will lose interest and will release their hoarded goods in search of a way out. If they want to sell their goods, appropriate methods of acquisition can be set up to buy up the hoarded goods, perhaps by issuing various commodity warehouse vouchers, etc. If forced measures are used on one side, then hoarders will inevitably have no way out under constraints from both sides. In order to suppress and stabilize prices, what we want to emphasize in particular is this point.</p>
<p>Of course, these policies must be implemented in conjunction with general price policies. Maintaining currency credit, revitalizing general production, and strengthening financial controls should all be actively promoted step by step. In this way, the psychology of anticipating price increases can naturally be completely eliminated. We believe that the center of prices in Central China lies in this. We earnestly hope that the Chinese and Japanese authorities will promote thorough price suppression and stabilization measures as soon as possible.</p>

The second issue will also be published within days, with content including Shen Linyu's "Prospects for Industrial Construction," Cai Shoubai's "Assisting Industry and the Industrial Bank," Pan Yinge's "Shanghai Finance in 1942," and Pan Yangyao's "Cooperation between the Financial and Industrial Sectors," all of which are necessary readings on economics. All employees of banks and various factories and companies should have a copy. The pre-order locations are the head office on Fuzhou Road and the western branch at No. 1010 Jing'an Temple Road. The inaugural issue is selling well, so subscribers should order as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Production Problems of Small Factories</h3>
<p>— Wang Wei</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Recently, the slogan "increase production" has become prominent in economic discussions. However, it must be said that the theoretical exploration of this slogan is not yet widespread or in-depth, and practical implementation is even further behind. Indeed, a comprehensive plan is needed, for example, how to achieve balanced development of industry, agriculture, and commerce horizontally, and how to adjust production relations and strengthen productivity—both manual and mechanical—vertically. At the same time, exploring some of the actual problems in the production process—or, to put it more clearly, some of the difficult problems—as reference material for everyone when studying the major topic of increasing production, seems to be meaningful.</p>
<p>China is a country with an agricultural economic structure, and industrial development is still in its infancy. In terms of productivity, the transition from manual to mechanical production is still in progress. Therefore, small-scale production still occupies an important position in the overall production volume. According to the statistics in the "Overview of the Mechanical Industry" by the Shanghai Mechanical Industry Federation (which only includes its members), among more than 1,500 machinery and hardware factories in Shanghai, those with capital between 10,000 and 50,000 yuan account for 36.5%; 50,000 to 100,000 yuan account for 17%; 100,000 to 200,000 yuan account for 11.3%; 200,000 to 500,000 yuan account for 18.6%; and those with more than 500,000 yuan account for only 16.6%. The situation in the machinery and hardware industry is like this, and the situation in other industries can be imagined.</p>
<p>Therefore, the difficulties and problems encountered by these small factories in production under the current situation should be given full attention.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>Small factories have many characteristics. First of all, the amount of capital is small. Unlike large factories, in addition to a certain amount of huge capital, there is also a large amount of working capital available for use. At the same time, precisely because of the lack of funds, the production scale is very small. If a large cotton textile factory can produce towels, bed sheets, etc. at the same time, then a small factory will become a towel factory or a bed sheet factory. Moreover, even if it produces one item, it still has to rely on external forces in the manufacturing process. For example, many small hardware factories that specialize in manufacturing certain locks or stationery items cannot complete the manufacturing of certain products and sell them on the market after obtaining raw materials such as copper and iron, because they do not have enough funds to add necessary machinery and equipment for production such as sand casting, electroplating, and polishing. Therefore, they have to rely on external forces, and these external forces have formed independent production organizations due to objective needs, such as electroplating factories and sand casting workshops. Therefore, from this point of view, almost all small factories cannot produce independently. At the same time, precisely because they cannot produce independently, coupled with the backwardness of general operators in production technology, their products are relatively rough. Therefore, they lack reputation in the market. Therefore, many small factories are regarded as vassals of large factories, manufacturing parts or certain steps of certain products under the operation of large factories, and the profits are of course very meager. But why can small factories continue to exist? The only reason is the low manufacturing cost, the small number of workers, the high labor intensity, and the simple equipment... Unlike large factories, in addition to huge manufacturing costs, there is also a considerable amount of management expenses. (Including entertainment, advertising, sales expenses, etc.) Therefore, even if their products are inferior, they just happen to gain their customers among the vast middle and lower classes of citizens.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>The turbulent situation has created a turbulent economic situation; prices are soaring, people's living expenses are increasing, and the standard of living is declining instead; but because of the abnormal development, generally the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. The same is true for factories. Large factories have invincible funds as their backing, so their assets are rising steadily. Small factories that live from hand to mouth will follow if they have special conditions, but most of them are becoming more and more embarrassed. Today, announcements of business transfer and rentals are everywhere. On the contrary, large factories, which did not have stock market prices before, have now shown their prominence, and those that have always had their market prices are rising steadily!</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the explanation of the difficulties in the production of small factories, I would like to talk about it with a hypothetical production.</p>
<p>Now let's assume that there is an order worth 50,000 yuan, stipulating a manufacturing time. According to the usual practice on the market, a deposit of 50%, totaling 25,000 yuan, should be collected first, and production should begin.</p>
<p>The calculation formula of production cost is manufacturing cost—raw materials + labor + manufacturing expenses——According to the profit rate of general factories, most of them are 30%. Then the estimated cost of this 50,000 yuan order should be 38,300 yuan. According to the general cost algorithm, it is "40% labor and 60% materials", that is to say, among the 38,200 yuan cost, 40% is labor (including manufacturing expenses), totaling 15,300 yuan; 60% is raw materials, totaling 22,980 yuan. Then the 25,000 yuan deposit must be used immediately to purchase the required raw materials, and only 2,020 yuan is left. These numbers, plus the factory's own working capital, will be used to cover the labor and manufacturing expenses for a month.</p>
<p>From this point of view, of course very few can make money, and it is very lucky to be able to avoid losses. Many end up with "trying to steal a chicken but losing the rice". Therefore, there is a saying among peers, "It's better to work hard than to starve to death."</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>Where is the problem?</p>
<p>The problem is very obvious: in a market where "money makes money", small factories that "live from hand to mouth" have suffered misfortune. Large factories can manufacture and store goods in large quantities, while small factories do not have sufficient backing and have to accept orders. Therefore, before the goods are manufactured, the trading companies that placed the orders have already made money. Small factories are making profits for trading companies, and this is the current situation.</p>
<p>Many banks and money shops do not often regard these small factories as lending targets. Although public opinion urges them to lend more to industry, they actually maintain the policy of "rejecting those who seek and supplying those who reject." This policy has harmed the growth of many production institutions.</p>
<p>The rice problem in manufacturing expenses (factories requested the authorities to increase the amount of rice allocated to workers last month), as well as the difficulty and high price of purchasing materials and tools, have almost become the main considerations of production managers.</p>
<p>The difficulties in the production of small factories are like this. Of course, it is not impossible to overcome them.</p>
<p>First of all, we hope that the problem of price fluctuations can be resolved quickly. Secondly, there is the expansion of the market. Shanghai's industrial production has always been supplied to other places. Now, due to transportation control and other reasons, trade with North China and other cities has plummeted, which affects the expansion and activity of Shanghai's industrial production. Thirdly, the connection between finance and industry should be strengthened. The slogan "increase industrial lending" should have practical steps, rather than just becoming a cosmetic label. Especially for small factories, the method may be carried out through various industry associations, such as the industrial and commercial loans organized by Fuxing Bank, which should be promoted. Fourthly, the authorities should give practical assistance to various factories, such as increasing the extra allocation of household rice quotas and facilitating the purchase of various raw materials.</p>

<h3>Beware of Lust</h3>
<p>— Liu Su</p>
<p>Confucius said: "A gentleman has three cautions: when young, his blood and vital energy are not yet settled, he must be wary of lust. When he is strong, his blood and vital energy are vigorous, he must be wary of strife. When he is old, his blood and vital energy have declined, he must be wary of acquisitiveness." These three cautions, Confucius said from the perspective of human physiology, are based on some evidence. This article focuses on discussing the first caution.</p>
<p>Analyzing it from the perspective of modern science, young people are most easily fascinated by "lust", either unrequited love, suicide due to heartbreak, fighting due to a love triangle, or taking poison together due to unfulfilled love. Generally, people in their "youth" do have the possibility of sacrificing everything for "lust".</p>
<p>Scientifically speaking, when the human body reaches a certain state, there will be certain urges and phenomena. When human beings reach their "youth", as Confucius said, "their blood and vital energy are not yet settled", sexual impulses occur. Human beings are not animals, and sexual impulses cannot be satisfied at will. It is necessary to perform a "self-restraint and return to ritual" effort, so Confucius said: "Beware of lust".</p>
<p>Judging from the general situation, young people in the current society, especially the children of wealthy families, need to "beware of lust". They usually live in luxury, are well-fed and well-clothed, and have nothing to do all day long. Therefore, they make a big fuss about love and regard vulgarity as interesting.</p>
<p>Confucius only said that people in their "youth" should "beware of lust", but in fact, there are two other types of people who also need to "beware of lust"?</p>
<p>The first type of people are those "unrighteous rich", who use the opposite sex as playthings after being well-fed and warmly dressed. In the past, the sexual scandals produced by emperors and dignitaries in the autocratic era can be said to be "countless". In the commercial capitalist society, the rich merchants, wealthy buyers, socialites, and noble ladies have succeeded the emperors and dignitaries. Their appearance is indeed dignified and luxurious, but their sex lives are often too scandalous to ask about. It is really "unspeakable, and shameful to speak of!"</p>
<p>The second type of people are those hypocritical moralists. In front of young people, they are solemn and serious, and do not mention a word about sex life. If it is mentioned, they give young people a bucket of cold water. But their private lives are decadent and unbearable, some frequent prostitutes, and some take concubines. There are prostitutes in their eyes, and there are always prostitutes in their hearts. Confucius said: "A hypocrite is a thief of virtue", this sentence can be given to these hypocritical moralists.</p>
<p>Confucius only said "beware of lust", but did not explain how to "beware". This question is studied by "sex education", and I will discuss it again when I have the opportunity in the future.</p>
<h3>Record of a Career Change</h3>
<p>— Xue</p>
<p>My wife has always yearned for me to change careers, because she has had enough. Being the wife of a middle school teacher, "Isn't the young master Fang next door? He's younger than you, and the bonus in their yarn factory last year was more than 20,000 yuan? He usually gets up late and returns early, and has little office time. Xue, I hope you can also change careers and become an employee of a yarn factory, so that I can compare you with him when Mrs. Fang praises her husband, and finally get this breath out." My wife has said these words in my ears at least three times.</p>
<p>Indeed, the life of a teacher is too bitter, living in a pile of chalk dust every day, and all I get is the money to buy rice for my family of three. Is it possible not to eat white rice? If I didn't have "a little property", I would have been a beggar long ago.</p>
<p>In the school, there are also several students' fathers who are said to be doing "yarn". They are dressed in Western suits and leather shoes, which is incomparable to my eighteen-year-old son, who wears a broken cotton robe, old cloth shoes, and reads old books bought from old bookstores. For my own life and under the encouragement of my wife, I also wanted to quit the "noble" teaching life and entrust some friends to end the hardship of being a teacher. I sat at home and waited quietly, waiting for the news from seven friends.</p>
<p>It's pitiful to say that among the seven friends, four are not even as good as me, with a monthly salary of 400 yuan and having to pay for their own meals. The remaining three are said to be doing okay. However, it is still a "noble" teaching career. The reason why they are doing okay is mostly because they have "many part-time jobs and small commissions". I have entrusted them for a month, and there is still no news. I am also preparing to break the "planned plan".</p>
<p>After another week, I suddenly received a letter with the name "×× Silk Weaving Factory" on it. After opening it, I learned that I was invited to come over for a talk. Just when I was confused, my wife smiled and said to me that the position in the silk factory was the result of her entrusting the young master Fang next door.</p>
<p>I have had the talk. I was appointed as the secretary. I thought I would finally make a name for myself. Although it is not a yarn factory, it is a silk factory, which is said to be not bad. There is also a bonus of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan to be distributed. On the one hand, I wrote a letter of thanks to the young master Fang, and on the other hand, I took out the ancient prose compilation that I had hidden, because I haven't warmed up the tricks in the commercial field for twenty years!</p>
<p>On the first day I entered the factory, I spent my time entirely in the writing room. At first, I felt calm, because there was only me in the room besides the typing trainees. Here, I don't have to "shout myself hoarse", and I don't have to "write straight" while holding a chalk.</p>
<p>The salary is indeed more than 200 yuan more than before, but I don't care. My wife said to me, "Mr. Fang next door said that the bonus in the silk factory is no less than that in the yarn factory?"</p>
<p>Gradually, I felt bored and hypocritical. In my eyes, there were no innocent children, only the hypocritical perfunctory of subordinates to superiors. In my eyes, there were no colleagues talking and talking, only the sound of the typewriter. Probably it is "difficult to harmonize with customs". They seemed to be a little disgusted with me too, because I really don't know hypocrisy!</p>
<p>The superiors became indifferent to me, so I had to "close my door and live". After the announcement of my resignation, I returned to the place I had previously disliked. My colleagues and classmates all asked me where I had been for the past six months. I just smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>My wife blamed me for being destined to be a poor teacher, and Mrs. Fang still said that I didn't cultivate well in my previous life.</p>
<p>Changing careers can be considered a change. Let's stick to my duty and educate a group of innocent children!</p>
<h3>Root</h3>
<p>— Xin Bo</p>
<p>In this novel, there is no thrilling story, nor are there bizarre and tortuous plots. It is just a true portrayal of a certain kind of life in a certain era.</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Sitting in the hall was a peasant who was nearly fifty years old. The bright light of the safety lamp illuminated his gray cloth padded jacket, the wrinkles on his face, and the messy hair on his head. He did not dare to sit properly, so a large part of the wide chair surface was empty inside, and the weight borne by the entire chair was only half of what it would be when a person was sitting.</p>
<p>His body was motionless, even his eyes did not blink. He seemed to be staying there. But he was not staying, he was listening attentively, listening to the low conversation in the study on the right, listening to the long-awaited summons.</p>
<p>"Old Gen, Old Gen," indeed a hoarse voice, trying its best to shout loudly, came out of the study door across a wall, "Come in!"</p>
<p>He, Old Gen, jumped up from the chair as if he had been electrocuted as soon as he heard the shout, and responded repeatedly, "Coming, coming." By the time he heard "Come in," his right foot had already stepped into the study.</p>
<p>As soon as he walked in, his eyes seemed to be covered with a layer of film, and he couldn't see very clearly. The smoke of water pipes, the smoke of cigarettes, and the water vapor from the copper pot on the charcoal basin formed a hazy scene, separating him from others. This made him immediately understand that he could no longer be so hasty. His second step immediately slowed down.</p>
<p>Bending his back, shrugging his shoulders, and with a slightly protruding forehead and a shrunken face, he put on a smile, tiptoeing, step by step, he walked to an old man holding a water pipe, and called out in a low, but warm and cheerful voice: "Master Huang."</p>
<p>Master Huang was sitting on the kang bed, sucking on the water pipe with a gurgling sound. Hearing Old Gen call him, he nodded slightly.</p>
<p>"Master Yang," Old Gen turned his body slightly and called out to an old man sitting opposite Master Huang, also in a low voice, but not as energetic as when he called Master Huang, but with a casual meaning, making people understand that they had just met, or that they often met and did not stand on ceremony.

<h3>Biography of Mr. "Waiting"</h3>
<p>— Ning Bachen</p>
<p>Within our scope, there is a young man whose surname is "Deng" and name is "Dai". Because his philosophy of life is to adhere to the doctrine of waiting, people call him Mr. Waiting.</p>
<p>There was a day in the past when the shouts of cries echoed in all directions, and people's disturbances resounded from the heavy pressure, so our Mr. Waiting excitedly said to his comrades: "Let's wait, the day we hope for is very near."</p>
<p>His comrades echoed in agreement.</p>
<p>After four or five years, his words did come true. Because in a dark night, a series of violent thunder sounded in the air. Therefore, Mr. Waiting said to his partner: "As expected, this earth-shattering day has finally arrived. Let's wait, this is just the beginning!"</p>
<p>"Congratulations, brother, your vision is really good, but you also have to do your best!"</p>
<p>"You are really stupid, what efforts should I make? Only the laws of nature will satisfy us, and there is no need to promote them. So we just have to wait for the free and happy days!"</p>
<p>His partner shrugged and walked away.</p>
<p>The wind and clouds are unpredictable, and the vicissitudes of life are changeable. Days passed day by day, but the environment of Mr. Waiting seemed to be deliberately working against him and became worse. He felt very suffocated.</p>
<p>Suffocation and depression moved his heart to move forward, but a thought turned him back and made him lurk in the horns of a bull, waiting. There, he could barely breathe. He stretched out his head to peek at the sky: the sky was still dark. So he shouted out: "Let's wait again, when the cock crows, the sky will naturally be fully bright, and the ideal paradise will also come."</p>
<p>However, the day that Mr. Waiting had been waiting for, a truly unhappy day, not only did not arrive, but was still very far away. Therefore, he could not help but waver his confidence. He was indeed a little pessimistic.</p>
<p>One day, in order to eliminate his pessimistic atmosphere, he wanted to go out for a walk and see the new situation, take the opportunity to breathe some fresh air, and bask in the sun. Unexpectedly, before he had stepped out of the door, he saw the streets full of terrifying skulls being punished by the god of "fate", and countless hungry people rolling around. He turned his sight to the other side, but there were cunning fox spirits, venomous snakes and beasts, and man-eating monsters. His face turned pale, and he fell down with numb limbs.</p>
<p>Suddenly, his partner, covered in blood, rushed from the group of ghosts and monsters to help Mr. Waiting up.</p>
<p>"Brother," his partner said to him, "Now you can understand, but what are your thoughts? Recalling the past will only make you feel more pain. We must do our best now and sow a solid and useful seed. Then your ideal now will definitely make you get satisfactory harvests in the future. Therefore, watching and waiting will not bring you happiness, and your happiness is to be earned by yourself. Otherwise, you are too selfish. Look, where does everything in front of us not need us to work? We have to shoulder the task of construction in the destroyed ruins in order to reach the new path of life."</p>
<p>"Don't talk about it, you fool! I just have an occasional nervous breakdown... But what you said, people have already been doing it hard, so let's just wait for that rosy day to come."</p>
<p>After shrugging, his partner threw away contemptuous eyes and walked away.</p>
<p>Several years have passed again, but for Mr. Waiting, the life of hardship and pain in the past few years is like decades.</p>
<p>His hair has turned gray, deep wrinkles are printed on his forehead, and his cheekbones are desperately protruding. His rocky skeleton is equal to a skull. He lay dying in bed and said to his former hard-working partner:</p>
<p>"Why is life so short, I can't wait any longer, it's so pity... Why can't I see the arrival of that ideal happy day... I'm so young, I don't want to die... I understand, you are right... Ah, I want to work... But I have no hope!"</p>
<p>"Our Mr. Waiting has died!" The young partner said easily.</p>
<p>But within our scope, there are still many Zhu dead disciples of Mr. Waiting!</p>
<h3>China Needs Middle-Aged and Elderly People Even More</h3>
<p>— Wan Cheng</p>
<p>The worst concept of Chinese people is that once they pass the age of forty or fifty, they consider themselves old and useless. They want to enjoy happiness! No longer work hard and struggle like in the past.</p>
<p>This bad concept should have a day to be overthrown.</p>
<p>Confucius said: "At thirty, I stood firm; at forty, I had no doubts." Before the age of thirty, we can be said to be living a life of "trying" in a muddleheaded way, without experience, or always talking about love and immersed in a hazy dream.</p>
<p>By the age of forty, experience has gradually become richer, life has also undergone tempering, thoughts are also under control, and the effectiveness of work has also increased. The failure of a person's career is probably before the age of forty. A person who has passed the age of forty is less likely to fail in business than before the age of thirty. This is a fact.</p>
<p>We are in the period of forty, fifty, and sixty years old. In these thirty years, it is the time to do something. The golden age of foreign politicians, entrepreneurs, inventors, etc. is from forty to sixty years old. There is a French saying "Life Begins at Forty", which means that life begins and career begins at the age of forty.</p>
<p>Foreigners can practice the saying "one is never too old to learn". Generally, middle-aged and elderly people lead the youth of China to move forward, so the country will become strong. The national life has a vigorous atmosphere.</p>
<p>People after the age of forty are the time for you to work hard and be promising. "One is never too old to learn", everyone is like this, and the country will have hope.</p>
<p>China needs the efforts of middle-aged and elderly people even more.</p>

<h3>The Nursery of the Notre Dame Cathedral Hopes for a Steady Stream of Assistance from All Walks of Life</h3>
<p>As mentioned in the previous report in this newspaper about the situation of the Nursery of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Xujiahui, it is deeply appreciated that the church is well-managed, but it is suffering from financial difficulties. In order to continue its social work, it is hoped that all sectors of society will generously provide assistance. Recently, a letter from Sister Bu Daixian, the head of the church, was received and published for this purpose. It is still hoped that all sectors of society will donate steadily, which is not only a blessing for the orphans, but also a blessing for the society. The original letter said:</p>
<p>"Our church has been running the nursery business for more than 70 years. In normal times, we only know how to manage it painstakingly and silently fulfill the duty of helping the helpless. We can barely make ends meet and do not make excessive demands. But now we are facing a day of exhaustion. Five hundred babies are waiting to be fed, and it is really difficult to have any hope of survival without the urgent assistance of all sectors of society. We were suddenly favored by your newspaper, which shouted loudly with enthusiasm, and we are deeply grateful. Our church will only work harder to encourage ourselves, hoping to use the resources of the group to continue the task of nurturing and educating orphans with perseverance. From February 22nd to the present, our church has received a total of 7,080 yuan in donations. We will list the names of all the benefactors and the amount of donations and thank you on their behalf. However, the minimum expenditure of our nursery is more than 50,000 yuan per month. We still hope that all sectors of society will be happy to help steadily."</p>
