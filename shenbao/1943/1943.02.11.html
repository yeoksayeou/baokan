<p>社評</p>
<h3>向經委會第一次會議進一言</h3>
<p>全國經濟委員會是參戰以後新組織的，爲處理戰時經濟的最高機關，現定明日舉行第一次會議，對於今後全國經濟，自將高瞻遠矚，周詳縝密約計議，而有萬全的決定。經濟措施與國民生活，有異常密切的關係，爲福爲禍，决於毫髮，謹就見聞所及，站在人民立塲，敬獻一得之愚，期望全國經濟委員會諸君子注意及之。</p>
<p>全國經濟委員會的最大使命，當然在於推進戰時經濟工作，對日加强協力，尤其是集中物資以供應大東亞戰爭的需要。誠如日本靑木大東亞相答覆議員松本忠雄質問關於「今後日本在經濟方面對華政策」時所云：「大東亞戰爭開始後，中國國民政府即於物質精神兩方面採取與我協力之態度，至參戰後，更在種種方面加强協力，關於其內容，國府在主席曾謂在恢復治安，昂揚民心，增强生產，充分發揮力量，以協力大東亞戰爭。因此我方與中國巳結成一體，深信國民政府關於收買物資，亦有相當準備，以積極協力…」。所以今後當局致力於全國物資之集中，以與日本協力，旣爲必然之趨勢。可是在集中收購方面，必須有全盤約計劃。第一主要原則，爲儘可能的兼顧中國及日本雙方的利益，一方面固然必須加强對日協力，以求大東亞戰爭之最後勝利；另一方面又必須顧到中國人民的生活，維持其最低限度必要的物資。第二，鑒於重慶政權在徵購物資政策執行中的流弊與失敗之嚴重，國府今後集中收買物資方面，務須職權嚴明，系統簡單，組織健全，而執行人員，務須經過嚴密認眞的選擇。第三，在物資收買方面，過去由日本方面的國策公司執行，今後必然將收買權交於全國經濟委員會，統一實施，此在全國經委會的責任方面，自然特別重大，應該在事實上表現出中國人辦事的精神和能力來。</p>
<p>然而正因爲戰時經濟的基本要求，只在於全國人民自發的自願的協力，才能獲得成效，所以任何主張，任何原則，任何辦法，任何措施，都不能不兼顧到人民的意願，都不能小兼顧到維持人民的最低限度的生活，重慶政權最大失敗的地方，與其謂爲軍事，外交，無寗謂爲由於政治，特別是由於對人民意見”人民生活的忽視。即在所謂「戰時經濟」政策方面，完全只由渝府少數人的自私自利，利用會議形態，宣布各項法令，强迫人民遵守，人民在黨政軍壓迫之下，一時固然無可奈何，可是由於積怨不平，終至不斷的促成渝方政治的危機，而其經濟政策仍無絲毫成果，經濟的危機，一天一天的增加，形成最嚴重的致命的威脅。渝府這種失敗的經騐，難道不値得我們引爲警惕的嗎？因此，我們期望全國經濟委員會實施戰時經濟政策之時，作更遠大更周密約計劃，以兼顧民生爲第一要義。一切經濟對策與措施，務求保障全國人民最低限度的生活，只有這樣兼籌並顧，才不失參戰的意義。因此在經濟方面，不宜僅僅着眼於物資之收集與統制，而必須更積極的致力於增加生產，合理的增加農業生產，工業生產，以及鼓勵中小工業的生產，只有有計劃的和有組織的推進增產運動，獎勵民問農工業的大小生產，才能保障參戰經濟政策之順利完遂。</p>
<p>中國產業有了數十年的歷史，關於官辦或民營，或官民合辦，曾經長時期的實騐。山於中國政治外又與社會組織的落後性，數十年來新產業的演變吿訴我們，單純的官辦產業相繼失敗了，單純的民營工業，也不能健全合理的發展，只有官督民營的事業才有前途。過去一切官督民營的事業，仍舊不能充分發展，主要的原因，在於政府對於民營資本，沒有充分的扶助，正確的指導，現在只要政府有決心扶助民營產業，必然能够使中國的經濟呈現燦爛的局面，不僅在今日可以適應女東亞戰爭的需求，而且對於將來中國經濟的發展，也有莫大的關係。這個「百年大計」，我們可以預卜全國經濟委員會諸君子決不肯錯過機會。因此，我們敬以愚誠之見，獻於諸君，如蒙採納，則中國人民幸甚，中國幸甚，全東亞更幸甚。</p>
<p>譯論</p>
<h3>土耳其須加戒愼</h3>
<p>前幾天英美在加薩勃良朗加會議的中心，當在討論本年度的作戰計劃。但會談後邱吉爾急遞的訪問土耳其，土耳其大總統伊諾努和首相，外相參謀總長參謀本部附空軍顧問等文武首腦，與英首相的會談，而英國方面除首相及參謀總長外，他如伊朗，伊拉克的英軍司令官，中東軍司令官等亦均列席，英首相更於歸途訪問東地中海的英海軍基　基普羅斯島，凡此種種行動，足以推知英美屬目的何在，在土耳其四周的作戰，或許爲英美作戰計劃的一部。他方面，對於軸心方面的戒備，亦萬不能懈怠。</p>
<p>關於土英會談內容的報道，尙不出於臆測之途，其結果，據英國片面的發表「英國爲援助土耳其强化其國防，以防止外國的侵入，盡共所有的手段」。而成立了兩國的協定，美政府亦决定參加以强化對土的援助。一九三九年以來，土英問雖儼然有相互援助條約，及附帶密的的存在，但都知道並未付之實施。今次據稱爲防止外國的侵入，而援助土耳其强化國防，但如何實施，並未明示。英美侵入中立國領土及侵害其主權，往往用先發制人以應付外國軍隊的侵入爲口實。今决對土亦用同樣手段，若所傳設置英美空軍根據地，無限制通過韃靼尼爾海峽等果屬事實，則不僅對土，即對德義方面關係亦很重大。隣接土耳其的羅馬尼亞，保加利亞，同爲軸心的盟國，又近多島海的東地中海的特台加納賽諸島，亦爲義屬，正列於土屬小亞細亞之前，而且違反蒙特婁條約而允許自由通過海峽，則土耳其亦放棄了一向所堅持的嚴正的中立。這當然不是復興土耳其大功臣凱末爾的繼承者伊諾努大總統的本意。英國與蘇聯的勾結，無非撞擊了土耳其獨立的喪鐘而巳。土耳其政府的首腦者，須審愼善處，莫迷於長期的世界戰爭中過渡的一張一弛的狀態，而有誤國家的百年大計。（翔：譯自二月四日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<p>東京十日中央社電　此間每日新聞今日社論、以在華敵產之移管爲題、指出此次之移管係以尊重中國之獨立與完成大東亞戰爭爲主旨而採取之措置、大意謂自大東亞戰爭爆發以來、由日本所接收之在華敵產其中千餘件已於八日正式移交國府管理、此次移管之敵產種類、計有紡織、造船化學等各種工業設備、學校、報館、廣播電台等文化設施及旅館、百貨店、大厦等日方之以此項在華敵產移交國府管理、乃根據一月九日中國參戰時所簽訂關於協力完成戰爭中日共同宣言之旨　、及是日東條首相對內外所發之聲明而實踐者、移管之目的、在　獻於中國自主獨立之完成　期國府得迅速强化、日本於中國參戰之時、爲協助國府强化、即決定在政治經濟等方面以一切好意加以援助、且決立即付諸實行、此次之移管敵產即其實行之一、故日方此次之移管、可謂爲根據於尊重中國之獨立完整與完成大東亞戰爭之二大目的而採之措置、而此次尙屬首次、今後自亦將隨整理之進展陸續移管、此項移管對於中國戰力之增强、直接間接均有莫大效果、同時亦可明示日本之重信義、即一旦的定必排除萬難斷然履行、此對大東亞　民族與對敵國美英等之反響固大有分別、然所予印象之强則可斷言尤其渝方見日本此種英斷、必受極深刻之衝擊、</p>
<h3>鄂省民衆大會　擁護國府參戰　林宣傳部長親臨致訓　並檢閱靑年團與童軍</h3>
<p>漢口十日中央社電　國府毅然對英美宣戰後、舉國人民誓爲後盾、鄂省府爲加强民衆敬愾降仇之心、及堅定信念起見、特於昨日舉行擁護參戰擊滅英美湖北全省民衆聯合示威大會、中央特派大員宣傳部長林柏生氏親臨會塲致訓、民衆大會會塲設在武昌省立師範操塲、參加大會各界軍政民衆團體達二萬餘人、林部長曁楊省長等於音樂悠揚中抵達會塲、二時正、宣佈開會、行禮如儀後、大會主席楊省長宣讀宣戰佈吿、並致開會詞、詞畢、林部長即步至演講臺前、對全塲二萬民衆作意義深長之演講、詞　、由民衆團體代表賀遐昌獻辭、最後於高呼口號聲中散會、會後、各團體旋即整隊魚貫出塲、每人手執小型國旗、列隊游行、抵漢陽門、各團體始行解散、又民衆大會閉幕後、林氏即以新運會秘書長資格、檢閱省垣靑年團童子軍、參加人數總共二千三百人、由王文權任總指揮、檢閱開始、首由總指揮報吿人數、繼即進行檢閱式、由林秘書長爲總檢閱官、楊省長等陪同檢閱、檢閱完畢、全體人員齊集司令臺前、恭聆林氏訓詞、其大意首對國旗之歷史詳爲闡述、繼對國民政府還都後國旗上加和平反共建國標識之經過、及其意義、以及此次取消標識之意義、最後並對靑少年對於國旗應有之認識、訓勉頗多、全塲感奮、詞畢、由楊省長領導高呼口號、直至紅日西沈、始於音樂鏗鏘聲中宣告解散、</p>
<h3>林部長演講詞</h3>
<p>漢口十日中央社電　國府　傳部長林生爲宣揚參戰意義、特於日前來漢、九日至武昌　範學校出武漢各　擁　參　擊滅美衆大會時曾發表演說、茲誌如下、各位同志、各位同胞、湖北省的民衆在國府參戰後第一、次紀念日的今天、舉行熱烈的民衆示威大會、兄弟有機會和各界民衆、各方面同學、見面說幾句話是非常高興、自從國府於一月九日正式宣戰後、兄弟爲官揚參戰的意義、曾經到各地參加民衆大會、到過蘇州和廣州、今天到漢口、以後還要到上海和杭州去、每到一處、民衆大會的方式雖不同、但是對於擁護國府參戰的熱忱、和愛國的情緒、都是一樣的、無論東西南北、興復中華保衛東亞的心情、都是一樣的、</p>
<p>國府參戰後、有一部份人懷疑、以爲國府是和平建國的、爲什麼求和平也要打仗呢、和平和打仗好像是矛盾的、其實這是誤解、我想武昌的同胞不會有此種誤會、各位要知道、和平不是苟且偷生、因爲我們要求和平的實現、首先要剷除和平的障碍、國府還都後快要三年了、和平爲什麼還不能全面實現、就是因爲有共產的騷擾、英美的挑撥離間、所以說從事和平、非先把英美打倒不可、</p>
<p>有人說、現在戰爭是日本和英美打仗、和我們有什麽關係最多我們表示點好感、或者予以一點便利、或者讓他們到兩敗俱傷的時候、我們從中可以取利、不是更好嗎、要不然、就守中立、但是中立是滑頭政策、尤其是處於現代的世界、決未有可以永守中立的、在幾年前歐戰發生、有許多小的國家、以爲最好守中立、不參加任何方面、但是守中立的捷克波蘭、還有許多其他國家都亡了國、在這個大時代裏、中立只有亡國、要救國首先要聲明立塲、決定所的路綫、中立旁觀滑頭滑腦、是要不得的、擺在前面的、只有兩條路、一條是英美的侵略陣綫、一條是日德義的軸心陣綫、有些人或者以爲走英美這條路怎樣呢、同胞們我們不要忘記了中國在東亞的地位、百年來在英美帝國主義侵略之下的慘痛歷史、重慶要走英美的路綫、他那最大理由就是以爲日本和英美打仗、跟英美走、將來英美一定可給自由平等、英美絕對沒有戰勝的可能、不必說了、就算英美勉强可以支持、中國跟英美走、絕不會得到好處的、第一次歐戰時、英國缺少人力、利誘印度參戰、說是戰後可以給印度自由、結果印度犧牲了無數同胞、自由還是沒有得到、這是最好的例子、重慶今日就是走上了印度第二的路、須知道國家的生存、只有自己的力量和熱血、才能够得到、爲什麼我們要憑一種僥倖的心事等別人去給我們、爲什麽要甘心情願去做第二印度、去上英國的當、我說印度事不是一句空話、百年前英國要在揚子江流域建立印度第二、要派二十萬兵征服中國、這個政策做不到、就改變方針、不許中國革命、擾亂東亞、不許中國和日本合作、百年來的罪惡暴行、血跡斑斑、我們能够忘記嗎、（明日續元）</p>

<h3>日作家片岡鐵兵著文　告中國知識人士</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日名作家片岡鐵兵氏、近在此間雜誌「現地報告」二月號、以「吿中國知識人士」為題著論茲誌大意如次、此次中國毅然對英美宣戰、必能全面　起中國民衆之精神、其所予中國知識階級人士之影響、亦必甚强大、吾人對此實不勝欣喜、茲不揣冒昧、敬以　語、爲諸君吿、今在和平地區內任職於國府各機關之知識人士中、尙有抱懷疑或思想不安定者、事實上在國府方面任職或協力國府政策者、其是否按其本身之良心而行事、若更進一步言之、即其良心是否肯定大東亞建設之理想、此種自感不安者、或不乏人、此種人一方面爲惑於渝方之宣傳、另一方面又認爲復興中國實有與日本全面和平之必要、故在此種情形下、其思想常在浮動中、其雖有此種精神上之不安、若在渝方則其不安必益加深、彼等深悉渝方極混亂、目充滿矛盾、故其良心亦不容其進入抗日陣營、論其良心何以與建設大東亞共榮圈理想不相符合、其原因厥爲缺乏智慧及信賴日本之勇氣、同時認爲日本係藉建設大東亞爲美名而侵略中國、因此日本之立場實爲困難、吾人當感到中國人中、很少設身處地、站在此困難之立塲上而予觀測時、實爲日本崇高之理想而感悲哀、</p>
<p>日非為本身利益戰</p>
<p>吾人曾再三力說此次戰爭、乃爲全東亞之解放及建設、並非爲日本本身利益而戰、中國智識階級人士中、尙有一部份未能理解日本遂行戰爭之日的者、日本所取立塲、必須使此種未理解日本戰爭目的之人士能理解日本之戰爭目的實非爲侵略而戰、人類之本性似極難信任他人之純潔、日本爲戰爭曾流去幾萬同胞之血、並費去巨大之物資及勞力其目的乃在建設新秩序及爲全東亞各民族之幸福、少數中國人對日本此種純潔之目的而抱懷疑、實基於人類最卑劣之本能、戰爭發生後、日本之智識人士所行內心鬥爭、乃爲由卑劣中求得解放之鬥爭、然中國之智識人士、除一部份革新份子外、並未提出此內心鬥爭之課題、所謂良心人無非爲基於本能論、而誤被近代思想所支配之良心而已、此良好所以與建設大東亞之理想相背馳者實爲英美之觀念也、</p>
<p>宣戰清除內心不安</p>
<p>余深信此次國府對英美宣戰之佈告、已淸除一部份中國人所抱之不安、此次參戰之偉舉、並重新喚起彼等對國家之意識、中國必須復興成爲一近代國家、此種理想、決非一題目、而爲生死直感的要求、總之智識人士因具有東亞之傳統精神、故於具有國家意識後、必能諒解日本之眞意、彼等能將本身置於一國之單位上、始能理解日本遂行神聖戰爭之意義、一部份人士若仍在以往思想不安之狀態下、則決難與日本同甘共苦、對同甘雖欣然享受、然對共苦則表示敬遠、日本爲將英美惡勢力逐出東亞起見而戰爭、戰爭決非易舉之事、必須不惜痛苦及犧牲、日本並不願有勞中國、然今巳站在同一互相協力之戰綫上、吾人對與中國共同作戰、實不禁深表欣幸、故在此點上、吾人應信赖中國知識人士、同時僅由吾人作戰而庇護站在共同戰綫上之同志、實爲有失該同志之體面、</p>
<p>中國與日必能獲勝</p>
<p>今因宣戰佈吿而已把握思想根據之中國知識人士、領導民衆、舉共苦之實則、必能與日本共同獲得勝利、中國宣戰對國家之意識益爲昂揚、因此中國知識人士對建設大東亞之理想、亦認爲係分內之事、並能理解神聖之目的何在、此乃余之觀測、至於如何處理以往影響中國人之英美思想、亦爲最重要之問題、唯此神聖戰爭、始能凈化彼等之思想、更能消滅英美思想、余之結論、即參戰後之中國、協力遂行戰爭及使中國戰時體制有組織化者、卽爲中國知識人士、</p>

<h3>日陸海軍代表報告　南太平洋戰況　首說明去年作戰經過　次闡述瓜島戰略意義</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日政府委員、本日代表陸海軍在眾院預算總會、報告南太平洋方面戰況、首就作戰經過、加以說明、大意謂、南太平洋方面、自去年八月七日有美海軍陸戰隊約一師、在有力之海軍護衛下、在瓜島資拉基等地登陸後、即與我方在五月下旬配置於瓜島之海軍小隊、當夜接觸、我陸軍得報後、立即派遣某支隊及其他兵力、前往增援、被派之第一綫指揮官、為把握戰況予敵以極大打擊與威脅、然終未達到擊滅敵軍之目的、其後更增強兵力、在南太平洋方面設立戰略根據、且為掩護今後實行大作戰基礎、乃使於該方面擔任牽制敵軍之任務、當時不但協力瓜島地上作戰之我方空軍兵力頗屬有限、且可協力之飛機塲、距離瓜島甚遠、約在千公里以上、而敵軍乃利用其機械力、於短時間內建築多處機塲、並陸續派優勢空軍、致我　未能獲得瓜島方面之制空權、敵軍在制空權上旣佔優勢、更增加兵力於機場周圍構築建堅固之壘陣　、因此後方我軍於敵軍制空權下、攻擊此等堅固陣地、實行長距離攻擊、實極困難、又新幾內亞方面之敵軍、即爲以澳洲爲根據地之美澳聯合軍、敵軍自去年八月起、即逐次增强駐屯摩勒斯比港之澳洲軍兵力、去年七月上旬、我有一部隊在浦那登陸、九月初旬、突破斯丹列山脈、且迫近摩勒斯比港、然因整偭關係、乃使向浦那移轉、堅守海岸綫附近一帶、與瓜島部隊同樣設定南太平洋方面之戰略根據地、以掩護今後確立大作戰之基礎、使在該担任牽制敵軍之任務、是故在所羅門羣島之瓜島與新幾內亞沛那附近之我軍　士、半年以來、即於酷熱潮濕之森林地帶內、克服種種困難、常以少數兵力猛攻敵軍之反擊、無論受任何損失、仍堅守要地、牽制敵軍、其間已確保自緬甸經荷屬東印度羣島至馬紹爾羣島及其以上一帶之各戰略根據地、部隊之配備亦已終了云、至此又闡述瓜島浦那方面作戰之戰略意義、大意稱、攻略大東亞各要地後、即進入追擊戰階段、追擊部隊之最前鋒、追擊至瓜島及浦那兩地、與敵方展開遭遇戰、澳洲與美本土之連絡路因之感受極大威脅、故美國利用短距離之接濟綫及航空根據地、舉全力前來反擊、我一部份海軍部隊、於瓜島先發制人、實行登陸、佔據島之一隅、然以航空根據地歸敵佔有、故我方於戰略上頗形不利、海上接濟尤爲困難、</p>
<p>日主力部隊已完成　大東亞共榮圈外壁</p>
<p>然半年來繼續苦鬥、於此不利地位反復加以攻擊、在所羅門新幾內亞方面、牽制美國太平洋上海陸空軍之全力、使我主力各部隊、自緬甸經荷印諸島、新幾內亞此部所羅門至馬紹爾及其他方面、於戰略上準備完了、成爲大東亞共榮圈之外壁、且得堅固今後攻勢作戰之根據、緣因主力各部隊之戰略展開、過於迅速整齊、故未引起世界注意、然此戰略之展開、即爲鞏固大東亞之外壁、實爲困難之大事業、因而美澳連絡路感受威脅、於瓜島牽制美軍、半年餘、使我方從容鞏固全域、美軍之戰略、實屬可笑、其次報吿瓜島浦那方面之部隊爲何撤退、遭遇戰中於前衛獨立攻擊要地時、通常爲本隊逐次加入此前衛戰鬥、攻擊敵軍、然有時使前衛於前方要地戰鬥、本隊於戰鬥準備完成後、使前衛退至本隊沿綫、此種方式於戰術上稱之爲後退展開、南太平洋之遭遇戰、即係採取此後退展開戰法、次談及、一、統帥之英斷、二、陸海軍之協力、三、軍隊之苦心與功績</p>
<p>日人奮鬥發揮實力　打擊美國放棄敵意</p>
<p>最後揭穿美國戰爭目的、表明必勝信心如次、日本從本侮辱美國或破壞彼等之權利更未有威脅美國之存在、然彼等則恣意輕視壓迫日本國民、於經濟軍事上危及帝國之存在、帝國爲自存自衛、乃不顧一切而奮起、戰爭勃發後、羅斯福謂其戰爭目的爲擁護民主主義、然美國民戰意消沉、羅斯福僞造戰爭目的謂、此次戰爭爲生存而戰、最滑稽者莫如前年十一月二十六日對日本發出挑戰書、拚命煽動美國民之對日敵視觀念、僞造戰爭目的、灌輸對日敵對思想、足證美國政治無正義與人道、僅以暴戾二字即足概括美國政治、美國純潔之靑年、因此在南太平洋上孤島森林中、喪失二萬數千之生命、今後並將喪失多數戰艦航空母艦飛機等、總之美國指揮者愈暴虐、政治愈無正義、我等更須奮戰、於彼等面前發揮日本人之實力、至彼等以正當禮儀待我而後已、故今後非僅擊碎敵之反攻、如不進而使彼等之心臟部受打擊、終難使傲慢之美人放棄戰意、我等因一億國民之努力與奮鬥、於戰塲工廠農塲家庭繼續决戰、彼等美人戰意、若不拋棄、必使美國之心臟大受打擊、吾等現正努力準備中、</p>

<h3>渝「參政會」鱗爪　一月二十九日澳門轉來</h3>
<p>按渝第三屆第一次「參政會」於三十一年十月二十二日開會，會期十日，今日視之，雖有明日黃花之感、但　泥鴻爪，不無一顧之餘味焉。</p>
<p>參政員顧頡　走到一九五噸座次上，到處等我自己存放之書物，焦急萬狀，後王參政員隱之來，相對之下，才知道是王之座位，自己的座位還在前三排同一列中，迷惑弄錯，飽受虛驚，二人不覺啞然失笑。</p>
<p>各參政員晨間見面，多以「昨晚警報躱在何處？」相詢。</p>
<p>下午會後參政員楊端六，陳源二氏因擠不上車，只得步行返舍。</p>
<p>顧頡剛遇黃炎培，拱手連呼「恭喜恭喜」任老莞爾報之。</p>
<p>參政員哈的爾，新疆籍，國語簡直說不出　能操極流利之英語及法語，渠曾留學叙利亞。</p>
<p>女參政員唐國楨，利用大會十分鐘休息時間活躍會塲內外，爲的是請其他參政員連名提出提案，聞提案中之一，是爲大學敎授增加待遇事，「大學敎授，反不如小學敎員一。這是唐參政員最關心之）點‘</p>
<p>陳立夫談到小學敎員生活時，謂小學敎師每月月薪約六十二元，並有兩市斗米（六十二元），共月入一百廿四元。</p>
<p>女參政員張邦珍詢問關於師資缺乏，敎課書無着，及童冠賢彭革陳詢問，關於學生營養不良，及學校中有學生隨帶手槍，橫行不法等詢問案，悉由陳氏擬　書面答覆。</p>
<p>有一敎育詢問案中談及小學敎員程度低落時，有這樣一段事實：某縣長因事出巡，該縣某小學敎員，爲表示民衆歡迎縣長起見，遍貼標語，其中有「縣畏精神不死」一條，全塲爲之鬨笑。</p>
<p>中工核長魏之光將向大會提出「公務員及針職員特別醫藥費」一案，正如魏氏所說：「現在誰生得起病？政府不爲這些人在可能範圍內想點辦法，他們若一生病，只有等死！」</p>
<p>提案中有主張學生必讀大學中庸論語，大學校得組經史研究會一案，討論甚爲熱烈。審査　見原為「保留」，劉參政員蘅靜贊同保留的理由中，有「讀古書，偽直製造古人」一點，彭參政員允彝問：「復性　院不是硏究經史嗎？」陶參政員玄針對着參政員劉衡靜的意見，發言稱：「中國應有人格訓練，中國應該提倡固有道德敎育，讀了古書，並不會變爲古人。」李參政員中襄，江參政員一平，褚參政員輔成都表示贊成　反對的意見，結果是可決「大學，中庸，論語為學生課外必讀書籍，全案通過，送請政府採擇施行。」</p>
<p>王參政員寒主於提倡讀經之提案通過後，突起立發言：「即取消我參政員資格，我也要說。」主張課外之下不能再加必讀二字，後因旁人吿以課外加「必讀」二字是可能的，王始默然。</p>
<p>各參政員對戰區學生貸金問題討論也很稱彩，提案人說明時有謂：「犯人在獄中，一切生活皆由國家供給，執行死刑之前，尙且讓他吃頓飽飯，爲什麽戰區學生因成續不好，就取銷貸金？因而使其生活斷絕？」聞者爲之動容。</p>
<p>關於羅參政員衡所提之撤消振濟委員會一案，仇參政員鰲對之大加辯駁，羅起立作極長之說明，指出振委會缺點達十四條之多，並謂有人對此案辯駁者，皆係袒護該會，陶參政員玄是反對羅案之一人，特別提醒大家：「不要因羅所論，就如把鎖將我們的嘴鎖住」，黃參政員宇人戲謂：「本席恐怕人說我被鎖鎖住，故不得不發言，我的意見是維持審査意見一。一時江參政員一平，孔參政員庚，王參政員立明，都不發言，結果是修正後送請政府調査辦理。</p>
<p>參政員中有一位獨脚先生，是章桐，又有一位獨臂先生，是梁上棟。</p>
<p>這次大會各組審査會俱極忙碌，尤以第四第五兩組爲最忙，第四組審査會（財政經濟交通）直至三十夜尙開夜車，趕議各種要案，各參政員皆有「吃不消」之感。每次大會，以第二組審査（國際外交）爲最閑，故有「懶組」之稱，但此次亦有議案十二件，一共審查不到六小時，即告完結。</p>
<p>參政員自由退席之風，仍未减退。且有些坐在後面的參政員，不時移坐於旁聽席上，與賓客作侃侃之談。</p>
<p>陳參政員逸雲，聞外間有戰區出來五年的有婦之天，如在外再娶，政府不認其爲重婚之說，大爲不滿，曾詢司法行政部部長謝冠生氏，謝部長以書面答覆，大意謂並無此事。</p>
<p>聞參政會共收到提案二百五十件，屬於經濟財政者九十二件，其中屬於物價問題者二十七件，此足反映全國上下對物價問題之重視。</p>
<h3>德蘇戰爭的現階段　羅斯托夫攻防戰　已臨最緊要關頭</h3>
<p>遍地霜雪，朔寒凜冽的德蘇冬季戰綫，到處展開着激烈的死鬥，其動靜極堪注目。德國當局亦承認戰局的重大性而促使國民應有新的覺悟，茲綜合各地的報道而觀察德蘇戰局的現階段。</p>
<p>北起列寗格勒地區，南至北高加索的廣袤的德蘇戰綫，蘇聯方面不顧損失的重大，而開始反攻作戰。去秋當斯達林格勒的攻防戰日趨激化時，蘇聯最高當局起用中部戰綫總司令官巨果夫元帥（當時爲軍團大將）爲總指揮官，率領預備軍五十個師團待機於斯城的北部，擬待冬季到臨時，一氣衝擊德軍的後方。德軍自始即已探知這作戰計劃，故以第六軍及羅馬尼亞軍的一部，在斯城占領地區構築堅强陣地，以示在伏爾加河一端堅決抗戰的決意。</p>
<p>十一月十九日蘇聯的待機部隊自斯城西北，西南部開始行動，揭開了在伏爾加河及頓河兩河中間地帶冬季作戰的序幕，繼於十一月廿五日在中部戰綫的加里寗西北爾齊夫，托落貝茲·維里基爾基地區，十二月十六日在頓河中游的博可捷爾，諾貝耶·加里托貝地區，繼於一月自北高加索中部的莫滋托克，納里捷哥地區，更有在列寗格勒東部拉多迦湖南端各地區的蘇聯軍，都取反攻的姿勢，在攻防兩軍的激戰中進展至南部戰綫而出現了以伏洛希洛夫，羅斯托夫爲中心，半徑自百八十公里至八十公里的大戰塲。</p>
<p>這南部戰綫的蘇軍反攻方向，在最北部伏洛納齊附近以郭利哥失大將爲指揮，收服伏洛納齊進向哈利哥夫。在頓河中流的羅果索夫斯基中將的軍隊，渡頓河以一部自斯太羅里斯克進向伏洛希洛夫格勒的北部，以一部沿莫斯科—羅斯托夫鐵道南下徑米爾雷羅伏加—明斯克里奧夫斯基，而進向羅斯托夫的北部。又自斯城西南部沿斯達林格勒，齊奧萊克，諾伏羅雪斯克間鐵道出果齊里尼哥伏地區。愛爾門哥大將軍隊的右翼，集中於頓河與唐納資河的分歧點，孔斯唐齊諾蒲斯哥附近，窺伺羅斯托夫的東部，正面沿瑪努伊齊運河北岸向羅斯托夫，左翼自薩里斯克西進，與自北高加索北上的部隊相呼應而衝羅斯托夫的南部要衝齊奧雷克。</p>
<p>如此，蘇軍在南部戰綫反攻的目標？第一爲羅斯托夫，遮斷北高加索與烏克蘭東部德軍的聯絡，更自南北二面包圍頓巴斯鑛工業地帶而奪回之，將哈里哥夫重復收回。又伏羅納齊在去年七月德軍開始夏季攻勢時，先已攻下，由此控制了西部的克爾斯克，哈里哥夫重要地帶。</p>
<p>蘇軍利用較去冬嚴寒稍减的時機，以戰車集團爲攻擊的主力，接二連三的衝到德軍陣地，加以執拗的攻擊。南部戰綫的敗將丁莫生柯元帥早已撤換，以年輕的伏托金大將爲司令官，與巨果夫元帥一同指揮八十萬大軍進行大反攻。</p>
<p>中部的北部戰綫的反攻規模小於南部，不過奪回了拉特迦湖南端的希里塞利蒲爾哥與維里基—爾基地區。南部戰錢的側面工作，因德軍自一月中句轉移新陣地後的反攻，漸成膠着的狀態。但蘇聯方面宣傳奪回希里塞利蒲爾哥的企圖是用以解救列寗格勒之圖。</p>
<p>對此南部戰錢的德軍，以攻略塞伏　托波爾的勇將孟休坦因元帥代布克元帥，一面反攻，一面後退佈置，展開富於伸縮性的戰局，戰錢的後方，因去冬的防禦戰。已構成了面向蘇軍的强力的新梯形陣地，因戰綫的延展頗爲廣袤，戰綫與後方不能不維持很長的兵站綫，顯然處於不利的地位，乃聯結羅斯托夫與哈里哥夫爲一綫，以爲據點而固守之，以爲來春攻勢的出發點，因此，死守各戰綫中心的據點，依德軍當局的說明，不是維持綫的問題，而現在孤立於斯達林格勒城內的第六軍的死鬥，亦正表示德軍展開作戰前途約計劃。羅期托夫的攻防戰現正爲此次冬季作戰最緊要的關頭，羅斯托夫的地理價値，對德蘇兩軍的戰局前途，關係重大，尤其是蘇軍，現在不是正傾共精銳，在降冬的條件下，爲防衛伏爾加，高加索，而從事決戰嗎？現階段戰局的興味與去年冬季蘇反攻時的情况，顯有不同，要約之如：</p>
<p>（一）去冬的嚴寒，另度下四十度，本年蘇聯中南部的平均氣候在二十五度左右。</p>
<p>（二）蘇聯希望盡舉在後方訓練中的預備軍，集中於南部戰區，不待德軍冬季最前綫陣地完成，先開始行動。</p>
<p>（三）北菲的國際情勢有了變遷，軍的一部業已移動。</p>
<p>但蘇軍此次的反攻，被阻於德軍的能守善戰，轉瞬戰綫躍動期春夏季即將降臨，屆時，蘇聯將對於自身的損失，為之驚愕不置。德軍當局現在率直的承認東綫戰况部分的失利，同時，俟冬將軍泥將軍過去，整備完整的新銳軍隊即將登塲，目前的東綫戰况，正可以看出德軍當局決意的一端。　（翔：譯自二月一日東京每日新聞）</p>

<h3>美從軍記者的現地報告　日軍戰鬬技術的神化　運用智巧令人無從捉摸　衝鋒肉搏履險視若無覩</h3>
<p>美軍舉共主力在西南太平洋方面進行決死戰鬥的企圖，在日軍不斷的反攻下粉碎了。全美朝野，戰慄於其犧牲的重大，打擊的深刻，而愈加感覺到「日軍的可怖」。在該方面戰綫從軍的某美國記者，將日軍在叢林中作戰的神東莫測，勇猛果敢，曾作如此的報道，而引起了一般人的注意。西南太平洋方面日軍的勇猛，猶如森林中的猛虎。前駐日大使格魯山於過去所獲得的經騐，曾說：「日軍爲美國强硬的敵人」日軍不喜歡作防禦戰而常取攻勢，他們的肉搏猛擊，前仆後繼的精神，每使美軍爲之喪胆，而手足無措。在森林戰爭中敵我雙方，埋身於年代久遠的綠葉堆中，雙方的距離僅在咫尺之間，白刃相接在這樣困難與危險的情形下，日軍極巧妙地施僞裝戰術而獲得很大的効果，往往在　秘的地方向敵人發射，敵人簡直不知槍彈從何而來。這種戰法，尤其在夜戰常加施用，使敵人無從捉摸自身的所在，而常發生錯覺。日本兵常用微細的聲呼叫美國將兵的名姓如史密斯或白朗，在森林中拖着疲倦的身軀放哨的步兵，當眞以爲自己的小隊長或中隊長走近來了，假使偶一大意而　聲，則不啻把自己的所在地吿訴敵人，於是突然受到襲擊。又往往一面吹奏着美軍流行的歌曲而泥進美軍的陣地。軍爲使火軍在森林中行動時磨擦樹木所發出　聲音，不使敵人覺察，常假作烏獸的啼聲，或獅子的吼聲，使美軍驚愕混淆，　覺察時，飛將軍已自天而降。日軍在行動時沉默，宛如狸猫的輕靜，旣聽不到聲音，也不見到人影。</p>
<p>日軍常用一小部隊突然在美軍前面出現，美軍當然一齊開始射擊，然而潛伏一旁的日軍大部隊，出乎意料之外的向美軍猛烈攻擊，使美軍措手不及而全被殲減。美軍並時常受到從正面直搗心臟的突襲，而一面遭遇致命的打擊。在夜襲作戰中更爲凄絕，某二次日軍對美軍陣地加以强襲時，首先山兩翼有太陽符號的大隊轟炸機向美軍陣地猛炸，　即自森林中突然出現日軍，從二面衝來，口呼萬歲，一面擲手溜彈，一面揮日本刀，似怒潮狂捲般殺到，無論如何　以防禦，　後至者仍絡繹不絕，在黑暗中，用手溜彈，手槍，刺刀等展開凄絕的白刃戰，終於突入美軍陣地一角，開始用機槍掃射，繼續慘酷的戰鬥。</p>
<p>在這二日的激戰中，有日本兵三名，其中之一爲將校，突自森林中躍出，口呼萬歲，手舞車刀，突入美軍司令官彭達克利夫脫少將的司令部，司令部毫無準備，對此突擊，全出意料，此三名日兵，擊殺美兵數十名，司令官　以身免，而逃入森林的深處。因此一戰，日軍的勇猛，使美車全體爲之戰慄不已。日軍的配備，極滴宜於森林戰，日軍有効地使用了臼砲，等軍器，而精巧的臼砲和手溜彈，非常輕便，一人即能携帶，在一個兵士的膝上，支架共位置之後即能發砲。日軍更持有火燄放射器，其手溜彈亦　美軍所使用的威力更大。</p>
<p>日軍步槍的命中率極準確，用以應付戰事的手溜彈極有威力，投擊的兵士，往往連自身當作肉彈，迫近戰車而與之同炸。日軍又有很多鋼鐵製的靴，用以爬上椰子樹，從上狙擊敵人，極爲勇敢，訓練有素，美軍司令官彭達克利夫脫少將慨歎說：「若不拾棄陳腐的兵法，而採用新戰法，則勝利無望」。在別國軍隊所視爲萬不可能的困難和危險，日軍則視若無覩，勇往直前。這樣的戰鬥尙在猛烈地繼續進行，敵人至爲頑强而充滿自信，對於此方面的日軍，我們能否收獲史大的戰果，至堪憂慮」云。（阿根廷京城古田特派員一月廿九日發。翔：譯自二月一日東京讀賣報　）</p>

<p>日本大使館上海事務所、於九日下午三時、在華懋飯店八樓循例招待本市新聞界、計到有大使館廣田情報部長、財政局代理局長花水英二、及本市各報社記者等二十餘人、席間首由花水氏對通貨問題發表談話、略謂、「目下中國境內通貨爲中儲券及軍票二種、其滙率爲軍票十八元折合中儲券一百元、此於去歲取締舊幣時、周財政部長及小原財務官曾共同發表聲明、表示決不變更其兌換率、迄於今日始終如一、</p>
<p>變更貨幣　從未攷慮</p>
<p>而最近滬上竟謠言迭起、謂儲券之價值有變更之可能、或稱日大東亞省將發行大東亞證券、以代中儲券等、以上種種、均屬無稽之談、緣中日當局從未考慮對現有貨幣有變更之擬議、更無實現此種事實之可能、中日當局旣經造成中儲券現有之良好基礎、自無需另發新幣以代之、尤其大東亞戰後、不獨華中一帶之人民、一以之爲唯一統一之貨幣、卽華一南及其他各地、亦屬如此、國府參戰後、中日兩國更於同一立塲同一理想下奮鬥、兩國人士孰小以最後勝利是冀、金融於戰事之重要尤甚、是以日本尤希望中儲券能更形鞏固其基礎、穩定其流通、日本靑木大臣亦曾闡明「在華儲券與日幣之交換率及滙兌率、兩國當局決共同維持、不使變更、過去在華各部門物資之收買、咸以軍票爲交換通貨、而今則得以儲券相通、其旨卽在使巾儲券充分流通、」按靑木大臣曾　中國最高經濟顧問、其對維持與鞏固中儲劵之價値、自屬必然、而滬上給傳之謠言、自斯以後、可以不攻自破、</p>
<p>中日力謀　物資流通</p>
<p>花水氏對物資問題、略抒意見云、關於物價、本人雖非直接辦理、然於貨幣則專門掌理、貨幣之上落變動、當引起物資之暴動關於此點、滬物資動盪之現象、實爲內地所牽引、如遊擊區之擾亂內地物資、以致上海蒙受影響、物價猛漲、能使物資於　後圓活交流、實爲唯一穩定物價辦法、最近國府與日本當局協議、使內地與上海之物資相互流通、預計不久當有具體方針、可　發表、本年中因農產物豐收異常、較往年增加三成、華北棉花又多增一倍、此項豐富物資、當可源源供給、動盪現象於後更可抑平、再加雜糧棉花、中國可自給足用、其缺乏之米糖、及南洋橡皮油等、當由日本於今後設法運用、免受短缺之慮云云、旋由廣田情報部長對收回租界問題、及一週間之世界情况、均作簡切報導、</p>
<p>發達敵產　可資運用</p>
<p>花水又稱周部長在滬、曾提出重要問題、（一）為生產力之擴充、（二）爲中儲券之充實、日方亦認爲莫大問題、最近日本發還新敵產、約値儲鈔五十一億元、此項資產之收回管理、中國自可充分運用、更足以解決上述之二大問題、又稱目下以戰事關係、無論何國之通貨、總呈有戰時現象、但吾人應抱積極建股之精神、愛護國幣、並謀保其法定之價値、切勿存批評懷疑之態度、」云云、繼即答復各記者提出各項問題、至五時半始各進茶點散會、</p>

<p>「自由煤斤」（即市上發售之煤斤）既感短細、於是儘速疏通來源、增厚供給、實爲急要之圖、常時據悉日本當道在沛東控制相當日額存煤、並在進行接洽新貨繼續進口、該委員會爰經決定將煤斤整個問題、送請日本當　酌核、一面請其將沛東存煤開放一部份、以應付兩租界之急需、並設法疏通來源、維持正常供給、</p>
<p>該委員會對於本埠煤斤需要、曾予詳細　查、並繕　報告、以供日本當道之參考、此項報告、曾於上年一月十五日提送日本當道、洎乎一月底、該委員會主席宣稱、上海電力公司曁上海自來火公司所需煤斤、已開始撥給、同時日商所存煤斤、已劃出一大部份、指撥供給兩租界、</p>
<p>改善分配制度　逐步抑低售價</p>
<p>與商院與上海日本煤斤進口商協會、爲謀統制煤斤供給起見、會會同組織一華人煤商協會、加入該協會者、咸屬煤業巨子、其任務爲在日本當道直接監督並與本局密切合作之下、處置和切煤斤供給、並按照規定價格、切實分配煤斤、在上年三月初、第一批煤斤經由上述團體撥發、自是以還、煤斤陸續按期增撥、所撥煤斤種類、亦漸次加多、分配制度經時時改善、一面提高品質、逐步抑低售價、煤斤直接配給大量用戶、未嘗發生窒碍、配給　該用戶之煤斤、均按規定價格與同等數量、但在配給商業小用戶以及家庭用戶方　、則感受困難、良以此類配給之煤斤、轉輾流入掮客之手者不少、而達用戶之時、每多超過限價、月與原撥之數不相符合、日本當道與本局有鑒於此、曾密　合作、實行取締、並採取强有力之　置、於是情勢顯見改善、</p>
<p>目下上海煤斤存底充沛、到貨亦旺、足供兩租界之需要、</p>
<p>煤球供給滿意　樣品時加試騐</p>
<p>關於煤球供給、當前年年底時各煤球廠所存鴻基煤屑、用以製造上等煤球、祇可供給本埠兩個月之需要、嗣經該委員會設法將若干煤業巨商所存煤屑、按照合理售價轉售　煤球廠、一面督促各煤球廠繼續全部開工出貨、以免發生煤球恐慌、並與上述配給煤斤之團體接洽、繼續供給煤屑、各煤球另售商店經飭令登記、藉以嚴密監視分配情形、</p>
<p>查煤球一物、爲華籍居民烹飪所必要、在各種燃料中、最為重要、該委員會因此對於此一重要物品、寄予特　注意、煤球限價絕　變更、益以煤球用戶對於超越限價情事　迅速　生反響、同時煤球廠商協會、能與本局維持高度合作、故統制煤球售價與品質一事、比絲制煤斤較爲簡易、市　列隊另購煤球之事、殆無發現、足證煤球配給確屬滿意、本局旋於上年十一月十六日、刊發第六一六四號布告、聲明移運煤球、無須請領許可證、</p>
<p>查各煤球廠所獲原料、種類與品質不一、故目下尚未許嚴格規定煤球之標準品質、但由於將煤球樣品時時予以試騐、煤球品質能維持相當優良程度、</p>

<h3>碑與帖（一）</h3>
<p>— 雲間白蕉</p>
<p>雲間白蕉先生，爲名書家，寫蘭篆刻，俱稱於時，本文爲演講稿，於書學上碑與帖的論爭，下一公正判斷，提綱挈領足爲後學津遠。</p>
<p>書學上的碑帖論爭，遠自乾，嘉以來的事。提倡碑的攻擎帖，喜歡帖的攻擊碑。從大勞上說，所謂「碑學」從似愼伯至李梅庵曾農髯的鋸邊蚓糞爲止，曾經風靡一時，占過所謂「帖學」的上風但到了現在似乎風水又轉了。</p>
<p>從主張學碑與主張學帖兩方面互相攻擊的一點說來，在我看去，只當時蟲蛀生毛桃和爛柿子之爭。這話怎講，且待後來說明。現　先講碑帖的本身。講碑帖，我們先得弄明白甚麽叫做「碑，」甚麽叫做「帖，」碑與帖的本身定義和其分野在那裏？</p>
<p>碑　立石叫作碑；以文字勒石叫作碑。碑上的字由書人直接書丹於石，然後刻的。包括紀功，神道，墓志，摩崖等種種石刻。</p>
<p>帖　古代沒有紙，書於帛上首叫作帖；帛難以保存久遠，因之把古人的書蹟摹刻到石或木上去的叫作帖。書與刻是間接的。包括書牘，章奏，詩文等等的搨本。</p>
<p>普通講到書法的類別，是以書體爲單位的：—如篆·蘇·草·行·正：以人爲單位的：—如鍾·王·歐·顏：在沒有寫明智者的時代是以朝代爲單位的：—如　·商·周·秦：以國爲單位的：—如齊·魯·楚·號：或以器物為單位的：—如散氏盤·毛公鼎·齊侯罍·萊子孫碑·　嶽碑·乙瑛碑·以碑帖來分優劣，以南北來分派別，這在書學上是一個新的學說。</p>
<p>原來「尊碑　帖，」掀起這個大風浪者是安吳包愼伯；承風繼起，推波助瀾而「尊魏卑唐」的是南海康長素。包康兩氏都是舌燦蓮花的善辯者。包著有藝舟雙楫；康著有廣藝舟雙楫。（其實只是一楫。）這兩部書影響於書壇可眞不小。但是發端這個　論的卻並不是安吳，而是儀徵阮芸　（元。）而阮氏的創論，又未始不是因爲受到王虛舟「江南足搨不若河北斷碑」一語的暗示。阮氏是有清乾，嘉時的一個經專家，所至以提倡學術自任，著述極富，刻書尤廣，亦能書小篆漢隸，相當可觀。他始有南北書派論及北碑南帖論兩篇文章。（揅經室三集卷一）淸代的學術，考據特別發達，當時古文字學尤大有進步。從古碑碣鐘鼎文字中發見新義，其價値正在足以補正經史。阮氏旣是經學大師，又留心翰墨，眼見當時書學囿於閣帖禊序，尤其是乾　皇帝喜歡學董其昌字，他本身旣寫得股惡俗氣；而上行下效一般號爲　家的書法專務秀媚，絕無骨氣，實在已到了要不起來的時候，所以以振弊起　爲已任的阮氏，旣有所敝發，思爲世人開拓眼界，尋一條出路，於是他的兩篇創論，就好比在病人身上打了一針强心劑，又替病人開了一帖巴豆大黃藥，使庸醫刮目相看。論兩篇文章的本質，原是考証的東西。就歷史的，地理的，政治的，發爲硏究性的嘗試論，亦可謂他是很富於革命性的。他實在是有所見，不是無所爲的。本來學術是天下之公器他　提倡碑，但他的精神全是在學術上立新學說的一種學者態度。現在先摘述兩篇的論據，以便加以探討。</p>
<p>南北書派論「由隸書變而爲正書，行書，草書，其轉移實在漢末魏晋之間。其後正書，行，草又分南北兩派，東晉，宋，齊，梁，陳南派也；趙燕，魏，齊，周，隋北派也，南派由鍾繇，衛瓖，王羲之，王獻之王僧虔等至於智永虞世南；北派由鍾繇，衛瓘。案靖崔悅，盧諶過適，沈馥，姚元標，趙文深，丁道護等至於歐陽訽，褚遂良。」</p>
<p>「南派書法，附代不甚顯著，至唐貞觀年間，始風靡大下，然歐褚之書風，亦淵源於北派。即唐永徽以後所書之「開成」「石經，」尙有北派餘風」</p>
<p>「南派乃江左文士之風流，疏　姸妙，長於啟牘，每用簡約之筆，所尙旣偏，馴至不識篆書之遺法。在東晋時旣多改變，其後宋齊時代，所謂古法，更蕩然無　矣。」</p>
<p>「北派乃中原之古法，拘謹古拙，長於榜書，蔡邕，韋誕，邯鄲淳，衛頸，張芝，杜度等之篆隸八分草書之遺法，傳至隋末唐初猶存。」</p>
<p>「南北　派，判然如江湖之不相混淆即世族亦不相通。此風至唐初尙存。太宗本北人也，然獨愛王羲之之書，故親虞世南。羲之書法，實兼南北兩派之長，可於現存之王帖中考而知之，蓋數百年來，盛行北派，民間又多用之，試考當時普通所刻於石瓦類之文字，皆有北派齊周時代之書風，而絕少似閣帖或王羲之，　之南派之筆法可知也。？　　　閣帖盛行於人下，然後　　碑版石刻，始無復有北派矣。」</p>
<p>「梁代王衷，南派之高手也，入仕北朝，唐高祖學其壽，故其子太宗亦愛好王羲之書法也。」</p>

<h3>華中棉產改進會　計劃增產棉花　以謀自給自足</h3>
<p>華中棉產改進會，於九日下午二時，假日本俱樂部舉行第五次理事會，到有會長梅實業部長，（實業部農業司長尤孝標代）理事長船津辰一郞，常務理事堤孝氏及中日理事二十餘人，討論民國三十二年度預算及事業計劃。先由梅部長代表致辭，繼由船津理事長報吿事業計劃，略謂本會創立以來，四載於茲，蒙中日兩國政府及關係方面熱誠指導援助，充實機構，擴展事業，改進華中之棉產。去歲棉作期中，因氣候並不十分良好。收成欠佳。並因糧食飛騰，致有一部份棉田，改種糧食，是以棉田之面積减少，生產有减退之傾向，殊深遺憾。但本會所指導之地區，因栽培優良種子，故收成增加。目因品質提高，售價亦高，農家收入，較前爲多。因之貢獻於棉業經濟者頗多，爲求充實大東亞共榮圈內軍民所需之棉花起見，則增產華中棉花之必要性愈大，本會適應此需要，擴充機構，發展業務，同時與棉業管理區辦事處及共他關係機關餘力，如情勢可能，擬將優良種子普及至江北鹽城及其他主要棉產區，獎勵改善棉作，幷擬附帶指導麥作，庶對食糧政策，亦可有所貢獻。刻正努力增產棉花，並謀增進棉農福利，復興農村。（任：譯目二月十日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>中日協力增進農產　日眾院預算總會中　東條首相答議員問</h3>
<p>二月二日之眾議院預算總會，曾由某議員質詢關於設定中日滿糧食生產圈之根本方針，東條首相即席答稱：中日滿食糧之永久政策，刻在推動中，不須依賴南方，始終與中滿協力，獎勵農業，以便供　裕如。日政府方面，刻正指導華方，復興中國農業，使中國農民之生活安定。指道提高中國農民之技術水準。</p>
<p>日政府爲謀中國農業之復興，曾於昭和十一年在靑島設立華北產業科學硏究所，刻已遷至北京，設備完善，爲世界第一優良研究所，堪稱開發中國產業之根源，從事改良棉花種子，飼養山羊，日政府對之頗多協助，抱有極大期待，並派往大批農業人員。農林省當局陸續選派日本農業技術家前往切實指導。本年大東亞省提出助成中國農業之追加預算二十五萬日金，業已通過，決定補助華中農業助成會。此外國民政府及各大國策公司亦多方予以援助，分派技術人員　往以謀振興華中，華北之農業生產。</p>
<p>東條首相又稱：爲　成中國農業，故供給所需肥料。開　運河，促進水利，並在華北開鑿自流井，以利水源。</p>
<p>過去中國農業之肥料，以河泥爲主，故肥素不足，刻下幸有南京之永禮化學工業公司製造硫安，彌補此缺點，每年出品頗多，中國農業之肥料問題，殆已解決。至於其他肥料問題，獎勵農民自行製造，成續斐然。開發中國產業之最大事業，即爲建設總署所轄之華北農業土木事業五年計劃，共主旨爲增進農業生產力，達到華北糧食之自給自足目的；並謀推進水利設施，以便加强航運，擬定水利設施工程者爲灤河，薊運河，白洋淀運河，石津運河，東平湖五處。此五區以水田居多，是以需用水量極大，其工程材料，就地設法，至於開工日期，將利用農村空閑時期，俾可使農民幫同工作，該五處之工程，自設計以來，並無若何障礙。</p>
<p>各地均在開設自流井，尤以華北山東省推進更力，預定自本年一月起至五月中旬止，蔣完成二百三十萬口自流井，刻由中日合作社，各地縣當局督工趕闢，不分晝夜，進行工程，成績或可超過預定；日政府已撥一千二百萬日金補助其經費，（任：譯自二月五日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>讀者應有的認識</h3>
<p>— 高棠</p>
<p>識字的人都想讀書，但讀什麼書，却是一個問題。有些人對讀書的態度是：非新書好書不讀，甚至只讀政治理論書籍。因此，住在大都市　苦於書太多，好壞新舊都有，生怕讀一本壞書，所以不知讀什麼好，住在窮鄕僻壤苦於無新書，有的，不値一讀。在學校裏，認為所學不能應用，只好應付功課，另找課外書讀，這是一種。另外一種專讀一門，與己無關者（他自認為無關的）不讀。因此有些做技術工作的，或從事藝術工作，只讀幾本他所需用的書，其他一槪不讀。</p>
<p>這兩種態度都有缺點。找新書好書讀是對的，因為讀書是為了增進知識，讀新書好書能使我們學得好的有用的知識。但舊書　也不是完全沒有好的東西，如描寫社會現狀的舊小說，像水滸，　　外史，官塲現形記等都能豐富我們的社會知識。而研究中國歷史更是少不得要用很多舊的史書作材料。這種書不但大都市有，窮鄕僻壤也可以找到，但這不是說要大家都去讀書，只是說除了讀新書之外，舊書也有可讀的，在學校裏就　不同了，學校的敎科書固然不見得都好，但是的確也有許多是非學不可的，如數，理，化，工程，史地，會計等這都是在校中可以學好的。至於外國語言更不待說。在這文化落後的中國，讀物常是不能滿足我們的要求，因此學好外國語言，就是獲得了有力的讀書工具。課外書籍要不要讀呢？當然要讀，但也不能因讀課外書籍，而完全忽視了自己的功課。其次我們還應知道，新書好書不是什麼地方都可買到的，而且有時就是能買到也可能因了其他種種原因不能隨心所欲想讀什麼就讀什麼。因此我認為新舊書籍都可讀。</p>
<p>再其次讀書一門是對的。不僅如此，我們還主張「做什麼學什麼」。因為我做技術工作而不能做好技術掌握技術，就決不會精通，從事藝術工作而不懂藝術更是不成。但是不能因此　高高掛起「莫談國事」的招牌來。其他書籍都不讀。不論研究什麼學問都要具備一般的起碼的知識，並且不論我們學什麼都是為了要替社會服務，假如不懂現社會是個什麼樣子的社會，就是服務再喊的多也是空調門。因此除了專攻一門之外，必須兼攻其他書籍。</p>
<p>這樣我想至少有以下的書可讀：（一）各種進步的理論書籍，（二）自然科學，（三）史地，（四）舊小說，古書。此外　於小說戲劇音樂以及其他各種有利於個人進修，人民大衆，有助於文化修養的書都可讀。而為了增加讀書工具學習外國語言也是必要的。　是不管讀什麼書，研究什麼學問，都　在某一種上求得精深，如果什麼書都讀，什麼問題都研究，都不求深造，（其實這樣也不能深造），就會成為一個博而不精的雜貨攤。什麼都知道一點，但什麼都不眞懂，正是十八般武藝樣樣都會，樣樣稀鬆。</p>
<p>有些人用了很大力量讀書，甚至把書的句子都能背誦，但是不能用。也有人讀書只是走馬看花，粗枝大葉不求甚解的流覽一遍，讀完了也只能說是讀過這樣一本書，却未從書中得到任何東西。還有人讀兩種見解完全對立的書籍時也不分辨是非，求得正確的意見，這本對，那本也對，究竟誰對，不知道讀書更糊塗起來。甚至還有人以書架上擺滿進步書籍以自滿，高興時翻閱一下，不高興時，儘讓　蟲所侵蝕，這不是讀書，而是拿書做裝飾品。究其實這樣的裝飾品不但無益，有時倒會有害，這樣讀書不但從壞書中得不到有用的東西，從好書中也不會得到有用的東西，因此研究一下讀書的方法—怎樣讀，就成為必要的了。（酬移濟貧金）</p>
<h3>圓與方</h3>
<p>— 克威</p>
<p>圓與方是兩個不相同的形容詞，一個是多稜角的，一個是圓而光滑的。</p>
<p>每講到一個做事認眞毫不通融的人，稱他為脚踏方步；對於一個不為威武所屈，不為富貴所移的人，稱他的人格為方正，同時對於一個四面能適應環境，八方都能討好的人，稱他為圓滑，正好像是一個皮球，在物理學上是個隨遇平衡，在任何環境裏都能生存。</p>
<p>在表面上看起來，圓滑的人是處處占到便宜，他能適應環境，他能够得到各方面的讚許，圓滑果然是一個好的形容詞，不過也應該適可而止，否則就變成趨炎附勢的小人了。</p>
<p>方正的人，往往被咒駡為獨頭，不過他的忠實，認眞，與守正不阿的精神，正是他的美德。世界上的偉人，科學家，都有了這種認眞做事的精神，才能得到最後的成功。</p>
<h3>鄕間即景</h3>
<h3>自尊與自誇</h3>
<p>— 桀人</p>
<p>一個人如果想在人生中得到些成功，他必須要有自尊心——尊重自己的人格，思想，行為　責任，這也是每個人應該具有的心理。</p>
<p>人類有了自尊心，生活才有新的發展，社會也就能够向前進展。反而言之，倘若人類沒有　種自尊的好勝心，那麼，就是人類不知道自己的價値和所處的地位確也　是自己不信任自己的力量，不相信自己的力量是能够成就偉大的事業，因此他便失却了進取心，不能謀生活的發展，社會也就永遠無前進的希望了。所以自尊就是人生最可靠的資本，它此金錢，勢力，親友的任何幫助效力更大，它能够使人克服　　，　陰障礙，而事業　於成功。</p>
<p>可是，自誇的人並不就是自尊者，也並不見得眞有進取心。現在　　會裏，到處都有自誇自大的人　，他們會把自己家無擔石的資產，而能在交際塲中表現得如何闊綽，生活如何的豪富，很多的人能被他矇蔽過去去，他居然也能得愈發利害，但是一旦事實敗露，結果他所獲得的祗是大家的鄙視，他以後永遠不能再受人信任了。</p>
<p>誇大自己不但不能使別人對你尊敬，而且有時雖然有很好的成就，因為自誇的結果，就能變成毫無足道的。一個偉大的人物，決不自誇，一經自誇，他無論怎樣偉大，也要成為渺小的。自誇的人決不是自尊者，能自尊的才能受人尊敬。忠誠的朋友們！不自尊的人，在成功的路程上，決沒有艱深的痕跡留着。我們決不要自誇！堅持着我們的自尊！無論對於何種事業，決不會不成功的！</p>
<h3>萬世師表</h3>
<p>— James　Hilton著　依今譯</p>
<p>（十二）</p>
<p>然後　提起，他在勃洛克菲爾德已經四十二年，他在這種很快樂。「這已是我的一生」，他簡單地說。「O　miki　praeteritos　refora　i　　i　jupiter　annos……呃哼—我不必—當然—　譯出來。」許多的笑聲。</p>
<p>我記得勃洛克菲爾德的許多變化。我記得—呃哼—第一架脚踏車。我記得那時還沒有煤氣燈，或電氣燈，在我們的庶務部裏，我們總用着一個人，稱為燈役—他不做別的事情，就是揩拭，修剪，並燃點全校的燈。我記得那個冬季學期裏，地上一片堅冰，七個星期不肯溶解凍—沒有別的遊戲，全校都在沼澤上學着溜氷　大槪那是一八八〇年吧。我記得，那時全校三分之二的人都患了日耳憂麻疹，大堂就改成了一個醫院的病房。我記得我們　狂歡祝捷夜的盛大烟火。這放得太近那個大天幕了，我們不得不去叫救火會來救熄牠。可是救火員也都在舉行着他們自己的慶祝，其中大多數人—呃哼—也正弄得很尷尬。（大笑）我記得勃洛爾（Brool）夫人，她的照片還掛在點心店裏，她在那裏作事，一直到她一個在澳洲的叔叔還給了她一筆錢才停止。的確，我記得很多，因此我時常想，我應該寫一本書。現在我　牠題名為什麼呢？「敎鞭粉筆回憶錄，」好不好？（歡呼與大笑。這是一個好笑話，大家想—吉普斯最好的笑話之一。）唔，唔，總有一天我要寫牠。不過我還是喜歡告訴你們聽。眞的。我記得…我記得…可是主要的是我記得你們各人的面孔。我永不會忘記牠們。在我的心目之中，有幾千個面孔—孩子們的面孔。假使幾年之後你們再來看我—我希望你們大家都來—我就要記起你們那此舊時的面孔來，不過也許很可能，我會記不起來—然後有一天你在別的地方看見我，我居然也會不認得你，你就會對你自己說「這老孩子不記得我了。」（三十二）</p>
<h3>一個保富法的實行者</h3>
<p>— 棄疾</p>
<p>自從本報刋載聶雲臺先生的保富法以來，一時家傳戶誦，不知感動了多少人。不過目前還不知道究竟有多少富翁能身體力行，因為說說容易，臨到了實行的時候，就不免有困難，所謂知之非艱，行之維艱。這個我們不必去談它，日後自會見分曉的。我現在要介紹給諸位讀者的，是遠在明朝時代的一位保富法實行者，他的行為，很値得研究。</p>
<p>在張大復的梅花草堂集中有這樣一段記載：</p>
<p>「西蜀某宦官按察，生五子，各立中下產，僅給饚粥，已身服御，亦絕不使有餘。旣老壽，乃出生平所積俸羨，可萬金，願佐公帑之不給。吏告帑金不縮，亦無公事　助。宦乃請令穴廢院而害之，題石版云：「還諸造物。」旣百年，窖如故。萬歷辛酉，　酋　亂，刦掠公私物殆盡，成都府士民無所得食，岌岌不守。有知其事者，白之官，用免殘破。此老高義，直貫千古無論，即其　宦茲土者，與茲土士民，皆廉吏廉夫矣。」</p>
<p>讀者或許要笑這位先生太傻，何必把金錢窖藏起來。我的意思，那時或許沒有什麼慈善機關的組織，他本要捐給公家，公家又不接受。到這個時候，換了別人，或許要改變初衷，仍舊把財產分給子女，旁人也不能說他出爾反爾，因為那筆錢實在無處可放。可是這位先生，見了這筆款子，就好像毒蛇猛獣；無論如何不容許它留在子女的手　，寗可請令穴廢院而窖之，不可貽子孫以百世之禍。我們看了，眞不能不佩服他的卓見。實在非普通一般有錢人所及得到。他對於保富法的原理，明白透澈到萬分，不是單單知道一點皮毛，所以一旦打定了主意，便決不改變。我們讀保富法，也應當仔細體念它所講的眞理，看了一次，不十分明白，不妨多看幾遍，直到澈底明瞭為止，那末臨到實行的時候，決不會有什麼躊躇了。</p>
<h3>「朝鮮春」讀後</h3>
<p>— 蕭叔明</p>
<p>在久已沉寂了的上海文藝界，最近却讀到了一册頗令人心愛的文藝作品，那便是朝鮮作家張赫宙氏所著的「朝鮮春」</p>
<p>朝鮮民族和中國民族相像的地方實在是太多了。因之在朝鮮文學裏我們常常發現了自己的面影，有時却更發現了我們自己的性格。當然，這些面影和性格，在時代的先後上有些不同，那就是說，在這一時期的朝鮮人的性格，也許在前一時期的中國人性格中可以找到，可是我們也不能否認，在現今中國的許多地方，我們仍然可以看到像「朝鮮春」裏的許多人物的性格。</p>
<p>「朝鮮春」是一册用畫家的筆描畫出來的風景的繪畫，也像用動人的音樂伴奏着的一首朗誦的詩歌。從作者張赫宙氏的描寫裏，我們看到了朝鮮的花草，朝鮮的人物，朝鮮的山河，朝鮮的鄕村以至城市的建築。有許多山水草木可以觸發我們的感喟，有許多寂寞的人事可以引動我們的悲鳴。而作者描寫的手法，正如譯者范泉先生在「前記」裏所說的，是用「一條微細的鋼針，輕輕地刺上人們的肌膚」，因此它的「隱痛却深入了人們的心底」。但是作者並不是專讓人們感覺到「隱痛」，有時也用熱愛的口吻，為了朝鮮的未來而訴說，例如在「朝鮮的春」的末後，他說；「原野和山巓雖然來春天，可是人間的春天却不知在什麼時候到來。難道春天祇會在花　而不能再有『春在人間』的時候麼？」在「美麗的朝鮮」的末後，他又說：「朝鮮的自然應該是美麗的，實際上美麗的地方也實在是很多，要是人們能有豐裕的生活，那麼我想，必然會是更加美麗了吧。」所以他最後這樣地吶喊：「我於是熱切盼望着這樣的朝鮮早日能够出現！」</p>
<p>因此，這樣年來，譯者對於作者的批評是對的：「他把坦白，赤忱和熱愛贈給了讀者，他以一稜灼熱的筆，有力地暗示了這朝鮮的未來的春天。」（見「前記」）</p>
<p>也正是這種坦白，赤忱和熱愛，使我們——中國的讀者們感到無限的親切！我們讀着它，正好像作者的話就是我們自己的話，正覺得作者所說的就是我們自己要說的話。</p>
<p>在寂寞多年的上海文壇，能有這樣生氣蓬勃的，使中國的讀者有親切之感的文藝作品的出版，乃是値得我們慶幸的成就。所以在這里，我寫了這樣的一篇短文，以表示我稱頌這有意義工作的一點熱　。</p>

<h3>A Word to the First Meeting of the Economic Commission</h3>
<p>The National Economic Commission is a newly formed organization since the war, the highest authority for handling wartime economics. It is scheduled to hold its first meeting tomorrow. It will undoubtedly take a broad and long-term view of the future national economy, carefully and meticulously plan discussions, and make comprehensive decisions. Economic measures are extremely closely related to the lives of the people. Whether they bring fortune or disaster depends on the slightest detail. I would like to offer my humble opinion, based on what I have seen and heard, from the perspective of the people, and hope that the gentlemen of the National Economic Commission will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>The greatest mission of the National Economic Commission is, of course, to promote wartime economic work and strengthen cooperation with Japan, especially to concentrate resources to meet the needs of the Greater East Asia War. As Japanese Minister for Greater East Asia Aoki said in response to a question from Representative Matsumoto Tadao regarding "Japan's future policy toward China in the economic field": "After the start of the Greater East Asia War, the Chinese National Government has adopted a cooperative attitude with us in both material and spiritual aspects. Since participating in the war, it has strengthened cooperation in various aspects. Regarding its content, the Chairman of the National Government once said that it would restore order, boost morale, increase production, and fully exert its strength to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, our side and China have formed a single entity. We firmly believe that the National Government has made considerable preparations for purchasing materials and actively cooperating..." Therefore, it is inevitable that the authorities will devote themselves to concentrating national resources and cooperating with Japan in the future. However, a comprehensive plan must be in place for centralized purchasing. The first major principle is to consider the interests of both China and Japan as much as possible. On the one hand, it is necessary to strengthen cooperation with Japan to seek the final victory of the Greater East Asia War; on the other hand, it is necessary to take into account the lives of the Chinese people and maintain the minimum necessary materials for them. Second, in view of the serious malpractices and failures of the Chongqing regime in the implementation of the policy of requisitioning materials, the National Government must strictly clarify the powers, simplify the system, and establish a sound organization in the future concentration and purchase of materials, and the executive personnel must be carefully and earnestly selected. Third, in terms of material procurement, which was previously carried out by Japanese state-owned companies, the right to purchase will inevitably be transferred to the National Economic Commission for unified implementation in the future. This will naturally place a particularly heavy responsibility on the National Economic Commission, which should demonstrate the spirit and ability of the Chinese people in handling affairs in practice.</p>
<p>However, precisely because the basic requirement of a wartime economy lies only in the spontaneous and voluntary cooperation of the people, can it be effective. Therefore, no proposition, no principle, no method, and no measure can fail to take into account the will of the people, and none can fail to take into account maintaining the minimum standard of living for the people. The biggest failure of the Chongqing regime, more than military or diplomatic, was undoubtedly due to politics, especially due to the neglect of the people's opinions and the people's lives. Even in the so-called "wartime economic" policy, it was entirely the selfishness of a few people in the Chongqing government who used the form of meetings to announce various laws and regulations and force the people to comply. Under the pressure of the party, government, and military, the people were helpless for a time, but due to accumulated grievances, they constantly promoted the political crisis in Chongqing, while its economic policies still had no results. The economic crisis increased day by day, forming the most serious and fatal threat. Isn't this failed experience of the Chongqing government worthy of our vigilance? Therefore, we hope that the National Economic Commission will make a more far-reaching and comprehensive plan when implementing wartime economic policies, and take into account the people's livelihood as the first priority. All economic countermeasures and measures must seek to guarantee the minimum standard of living for the people, and only in this way can we take care of both and not lose the meaning of participating in the war. Therefore, in the economic field, we should not only focus on the collection and control of materials, but also actively devote ourselves to increasing production, rationally increasing agricultural production, industrial production, and encouraging the production of small and medium-sized industries. Only by planning and organizing the promotion of the production increase movement, and rewarding the large and small production of the people in agriculture and industry, can we guarantee the smooth completion of the wartime economic policy.</p>
<p>China's industry has a history of several decades. Regarding whether it is government-run, privately-run, or jointly run by government and private sectors, it has undergone a long period of experimentation. Due to the backwardness of China's politics and social organization, the evolution of new industries over the past few decades tells us that purely government-run industries have failed one after another, and purely privately-run industries cannot develop in a sound and rational manner. Only businesses supervised by the government and run by private sectors have a future. In the past, all businesses supervised by the government and run by private sectors still could not fully develop, mainly because the government did not provide sufficient support and correct guidance to private capital. Now, as long as the government is determined to support private industries, it will certainly be able to present a brilliant picture of China's economy, not only to meet the needs of the Greater East Asia War today, but also to have a great impact on the future development of China's economy. We can predict that the gentlemen of the National Economic Commission will never miss this "century-old plan." Therefore, we respectfully offer our foolish opinions to you. If they are adopted, the Chinese people will be fortunate, China will be fortunate, and the entire East Asia will be even more fortunate.</p>

<h3>Turkey Needs to Be More Cautious</h3>
<p>The focus of the British and American meeting in Casablanca a few days ago was on discussing this year's war plan. However, after the meeting, Churchill urgently visited Turkey. The Turkish President Inönü and the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, Chief of General Staff, General Staff Headquarters, and Air Force Advisor and other civilian and military leaders held talks with the British Prime Minister. In addition to the Prime Minister and the Chief of General Staff, British officials such as the commanders of the British forces in Iran and Iraq, and the commander of the Middle East forces were also present. On his way back, the British Prime Minister also visited the British naval base on the eastern Mediterranean island of Cyprus. All these actions are enough to infer where the British and Americans are focusing. The operations around Turkey may be part of the British and American war plan. On the other hand, vigilance against the Axis powers must not be relaxed.</p>
<p>Reports on the content of the British-Turkish talks are still speculative. According to the one-sided British announcement, "Britain will use all means to help Turkey strengthen its national defense to prevent foreign invasion." And a agreement was concluded between the two countries, and the US government also decided to participate in strengthening aid to Turkey. Since 1939, there has been a mutual assistance treaty and secret documents between Turkey and the UK, but it is known that they have not been implemented. This time, it is said that Turkey will be assisted in strengthening its national defense to prevent foreign invasion, but how it will be implemented is not specified. The United Kingdom and the United States often use the pretext of preemptively responding to the invasion of foreign troops to invade the territory of neutral countries and infringe upon their sovereignty. If the same means are used against Turkey and the reports that British and American air bases will be set up and the Dardanelles Strait will be crossed without restriction are true, then it will not only be important to Turkey, but also to Germany and Italy. Romania and Bulgaria, which border Turkey, are both allies of the Axis powers, and the Dodecanese Islands in the eastern Mediterranean near the island of Rhodes, which belong to Italy, are in front of Turkish Asia Minor. Moreover, by allowing free passage through the strait in violation of the Montreux Convention, Turkey has also abandoned the strict neutrality that it has always insisted on. This is certainly not the intention of President Inönü, the successor of Kemal Atatürk, the great hero of the revival of Turkey. The collusion between Britain and the Soviet Union is nothing more than ringing the death knell for Turkey's independence. The leaders of the Turkish government must act prudently and not be confused by the ups and downs of the long-term world war, and mislead the country's long-term plan.

<h3>The Economic Commission Will Meet Tomorrow to Discuss Wartime Economic Policies. All Members Have Arrived in the Capital One After Another</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - The National Government considers the determination and implementation of wartime economic policies after the British and American war as an urgent task at present. The National Economic Commission is specifically scheduled to hold its first plenary committee meeting in the capital on February 12. The members of the committee have arrived in the capital one after another. In addition to the original members, the members attending the meeting include the heads of relevant agencies of the North China Political Affairs Commission, representatives of various non-governmental organizations, leaders of the financial sector, and leaders of the industrial sector, all of whom are important figures in the domestic economic circle. It can be seen that officials and civilians will work together to promote the wartime economy, which is of great significance.</p>
<h3>Outline of the List of Enemy Property Transferred in North China</h3>
<p>Beijing, 10th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Minister to China Yamazawa visited Zhu, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, on the afternoon of the 9th to deal with the enemy property of the British and Americans in China, and personally handed over the list of 749 enemy properties to be transferred in North China. The enemy properties to be transferred this time are divided into three categories. The first category is those that are still used and managed by the Japanese army recently due to military necessity. The second category is those that have been transferred, but with some conditions attached to their use and management. The third category is those that are unconditionally returned to the manager. Among them, there are 48 items in the first category in general, 25 items in cultural relations; 45 items in the second category in general, 13 items in cultural relations; 656 items in the third category in general, 646 items in cultural relations; A total of 749 items. In addition, the number of items belonging to Japan is 58 in general and 18 in cultural institutions, a total of 78 items. Therefore, the share of all British and American enemy properties in North China returned to Chinese managers is 90%. Among the enemy properties to be transferred this time, the main ones include part of Yenching University in the first category, the Salvation Army Officer School, Jinan Qilu University, and Tianjin Recha Hotel, and part of Yenching University in the second category, and the property of the Tianjin Municipal Council, Tianjin Times, Beijing Times, and other primary and secondary schools and churches in the third category.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Mainichi Shimbun here today published an editorial entitled "Transfer of Enemy Property in China," pointing out that the transfer this time is a measure taken with the aim of respecting China's independence and completing the Greater East Asia War. It said that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, more than a thousand enemy properties in China received by Japan have been officially handed over to the National Government for management on the 8th. The types of enemy properties to be transferred this time include various industrial equipment such as textiles, shipbuilding, and chemicals, cultural facilities such as schools, newspapers, and radio stations, and hotels, department stores, and buildings. The Japanese side handed over these enemy properties in China to the National Government for management based on the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration on Cooperating in the Completion of the War signed on January 9 when China participated in the war, and the statement issued by Prime Minister Tojo to the inside and outside on the same day. The purpose of the transfer is to contribute to the completion of China's independence and to strengthen it quickly. When China participated in the war, Japan decided to assist the National Government in strengthening it, and decided to provide assistance in all good faith in political and economic aspects, and decided to implement it immediately. The transfer of enemy property this time is one of its implementation. Therefore, the transfer of the Japanese side this time can be said to be a measure taken based on the two major goals of respecting China's independence and integrity and completing the Greater East Asia War. This is the first time, and it will be transferred successively with the progress of the reorganization in the future. This transfer will have a great effect on the enhancement of China's combat power, both directly and indirectly. At the same time, it can also clearly show Japan's integrity, that is, it will definitely fulfill its promises despite all difficulties. The repercussions for the Greater East Asian nations and the enemy countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom are certainly very different, but it can be said that the impression it gives is particularly strong. It can be asserted that the Chongqing side will be deeply shocked by Japan's decisiveness.</p>
<h3>Hubei Provincial People's Congress Supports the National Government's Participation in the War. Propaganda Minister Lin Personally Delivered Instructions and Inspected the Youth Corps and Scouts</h3>
<p>Hankou, 10th (Central News Agency) - After the National Government resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States, the people of the whole country vowed to support it. In order to strengthen the people's patriotism and hatred of the enemy and firm their beliefs, the Hubei Provincial Government held a joint demonstration of the Hubei Provincial People's Congress yesterday to support the war and destroy the British and Americans. Lin Baisheng, a special commissioner and propaganda minister of the Central Government, personally came to the venue to deliver instructions. The venue of the People's Congress was set up in the Wuchang Provincial Normal School playground. More than 20,000 people from all walks of life, military, government, and civilian groups participated in the meeting. Minister Lin and Governor Yang arrived at the venue amid melodious music. At 2:00 p.m., the meeting was announced. After performing the ceremony, Governor Yang, the chairman of the congress, read the declaration of war and delivered an opening speech. After the speech, Minister Lin stepped to the podium and delivered a profound speech to the 20,000 people in the audience. After the speech, He Xiachang, a representative of the people's groups, gave a speech. Finally, the meeting adjourned amid shouts of slogans. After the meeting, the groups immediately lined up and marched out of the venue in an orderly manner, each holding a small national flag and parading to Hanyangmen, where the groups dispersed. In addition, after the closing of the People's Congress, Lin, in his capacity as Secretary-General of the New Movement, inspected the youth corps scouts in the provincial capital, with a total of 2,300 people, with Wang Wenquan as the commander-in-chief. At the beginning of the inspection, the commander-in-chief reported the number of people, and then the inspection ceremony was carried out. Secretary-General Lin was the chief inspector, accompanied by Governor Yang and others. After the inspection, all the personnel gathered in front of the command platform and listened to Minister Lin's instructions respectfully. His general idea was to elaborate on the history of the national flag, followed by the course and significance of adding peace, anti-communism, and nation-building symbols to the national flag after the return of the National Government to the capital, as well as the significance of canceling the symbols this time. Finally, he gave a lot of instructions to young people on their understanding of the national flag. The whole venue was inspired. After the speech, Governor Yang led the shouting of slogans until the red sun set in the west, and the meeting was announced to be dismissed amid the sound of music.</p>
<h3>Minister Lin's Speech</h3>
<p>Hankou, 10th (Central News Agency) - In order to publicize the significance of participating in the war, Lin Baisheng, Propaganda Minister of the National Government, came to Hankou a few days ago. On the 9th, he gave a speech at the Wuhan General Assembly for Supporting the War and Destroying the United States held at the Wuchang Model School. The following is a record: Comrades, compatriots, the people of Hubei Province are holding a warm people's demonstration rally today, the first anniversary of the National Government's participation in the war. I am very happy to have the opportunity to meet and say a few words to people from all walks of life and students from all aspects. Since the National Government officially declared war on January 9, I have been to various places to participate in the People's Congress to promote the significance of participating in the war. I have been to Suzhou and Guangzhou, and today I came to Hankou, and I will go to Shanghai and Hangzhou later. The way the People's Congress is held in each place is different, but the enthusiasm for supporting the National Government's participation in the war and the patriotic sentiment are the same. No matter east, west, south, or north, the mood of revitalizing China and defending East Asia is the same.</p>
<p>After the National Government participated in the war, some people doubted why the National Government, which is for peace and nation-building, also has to fight a war. Peace and war seem to be contradictory. In fact, this is a misunderstanding. I think the compatriots in Wuchang will not have this misunderstanding. Everyone should know that peace is not about living in humiliation. Because we want to realize peace, we must first remove the obstacles to peace. It has been almost three years since the National Government returned to the capital. Why has peace not been fully realized? It is because of the communist disturbances and the instigation of the British and Americans. Therefore, to engage in peace, we must first defeat the British and Americans.</p>
<p>Some people say that the current war is between Japan and the British and Americans. What does it have to do with us? At most, we express some goodwill, or give them some convenience, or let them be defeated on both sides, and we can benefit from it. Isn't it better? Otherwise, we should remain neutral. But neutrality is a slippery policy, especially in the modern world. There is no way to remain neutral forever. A few years ago, when the European War broke out, many small countries thought it was best to remain neutral and not participate in any side. But the neutral Czechoslovakia, Poland, and many other countries were destroyed. In this great era, neutrality only leads to the destruction of the country. To save the country, we must first declare our position and determine the path we will take. Neutral bystanders are slippery and cannot be tolerated. There are only two paths in front of us: one is the aggressive front of the British and Americans, and the other is the axis front of Japan, Germany, and Italy. Some people may think, what about taking the path of the British and Americans? Compatriots, we must not forget China's position in East Asia and the painful history of the past 100 years under the aggression of British and American imperialism. Chongqing wants to take the path of the British and Americans, and its biggest reason is that Japan and the British and Americans are fighting, and if they follow the British and Americans, they will definitely be given freedom and equality in the future. It is absolutely impossible for the British and Americans to win. Not to mention, even if the British and Americans can barely support it, China will never benefit if it follows the British and Americans. During the First European War, Britain lacked manpower and lured India to participate in the war, saying that it would give India freedom after the war. As a result, India sacrificed countless compatriots, and freedom was still not obtained. This is the best example. Today, Chongqing is taking the second path of India. We must know that the survival of the country can only be obtained by its own strength and blood. Why should we rely on a fluke to wait for others to give it to us? Why should we willingly become the second India and be fooled by Britain? I say that the Indian thing is not an empty talk. A hundred years ago, Britain wanted to establish the second India in the Yangtze River basin and send 200,000 troops to conquer China. This policy could not be done, so it changed its policy, not allowing China to have a revolution, disturbing East Asia, and not allowing China and Japan to cooperate. Can we forget the crimes and atrocities of the past 100 years, stained with blood? (Continued Tomorrow)</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Attack Hunan and Guangxi Again. The Airports in Lingling, Guilin, and Chongqing Were Bombed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - On the 9th, the Japanese Army Air Force again launched two air raids on Guilin, Liuzhou, and Lingling, the base of the Chongqing army in Guangxi and Hunan, with a joint formation of fighters and bombers in the morning and afternoon. On the same day, the Japanese planes aimed at the runway of the Guilin airport and the remaining auxiliary facilities such as the fuel depot and communication station in the southwest of the airport, and bombed them fiercely, causing heavy damage. Another team bombed Liuzhou (100 kilometers southwest of Guilin), destroying the runway of the airport. The fighter team also attacked Chongqing army military trucks in operation in the northeast of the city, making them unable to operate. Another mobile team attacked Liuzhou again in the afternoon in adverse weather. The hangar, station, and warehouse in the area were hit by bombs and caught fire, burning fiercely. Another team attacked Lingling, destroyed the military facilities in the area, and then returned to its original defense safely.

First, Liu, Director of the Propaganda Department, delivered an opening speech, followed by Hayashi Fusawo and attendees who successively expressed their opinions, elaborating in detail on the opinions on cultural communication between China and Japan and the new development of oriental culture in the future, exchanging opinions with each other, which was very harmonious. After the meeting, the Ministry of Propaganda hosted a banquet for Hayashi. During the banquet, Deputy Minister Guo delivered a welcome speech, followed by Hayashi's reply. It was not until 8:00 p.m. that the banquet dispersed. In the evening, Ding, Chairman of the Chinese Social Welfare Association, also invited Hayashi to watch a play at the National Assembly Hall.</p>

<h3>Article by Japanese Author Kataoka Teppei: A Message to Chinese Intellectuals</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - Japanese author Kataoka Teppei recently published an article titled "A Message to Chinese Intellectuals" in the February issue of the magazine "Genchi Hōkoku" (Local Report). The gist of the article is as follows: This time, China has resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States, which will surely comprehensively arouse the spirit of the Chinese people. The influence it will have on the Chinese intellectual class will also be very strong. We are truly delighted about this. I will now venture to offer some sincere words to you all. Among the intellectuals who are currently working in various government agencies of the National Government in peaceful areas, there are still those who harbor doubts or unstable thoughts. In fact, those who work for the National Government or cooperate with its policies, are they acting according to their own conscience? If we go a step further, does their conscience affirm the ideal of Greater East Asia construction? There are probably not a few who feel uneasy about this. On the one hand, they are confused by the Chongqing faction's propaganda, and on the other hand, they believe that the revival of China requires overall peace with Japan. Therefore, under such circumstances, their thoughts are often in flux. Although they have this kind of spiritual unease, their unease will only deepen if they side with Chongqing. They are well aware that the Chongqing faction is extremely chaotic and full of contradictions, so their conscience does not allow them to enter the anti-Japanese camp. The reason why their conscience does not conform to the ideal of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is because they lack the wisdom and the courage to trust Japan. At the same time, they believe that Japan is using the construction of Greater East Asia as a pretext to invade China. Therefore, Japan's position is truly difficult. We cannot help but feel sadness for Japan's noble ideal when we see that very few Chinese people put themselves in our shoes, stand in this difficult position, and observe us.</p>
<p>Japan is Not Fighting for Its Own Interests</p>
<p>We have repeatedly emphasized that this war is for the liberation and construction of all of East Asia, and not for Japan's own interests. Among the Chinese intellectual class, there is still a portion that has not understood Japan's purpose in waging war. Japan must take a stance that allows those who have not understood Japan's war aims to understand that Japan's war aims are not for aggression. Human nature seems to make it extremely difficult to trust the purity of others. Japan has shed the blood of tens of thousands of its compatriots for this war, and has spent huge amounts of material resources and labor. Its purpose is to build a new order and for the happiness of all the peoples of East Asia. The fact that a small number of Chinese people harbor doubts about Japan's pure intentions is based on the most base of human instincts. After the outbreak of the war, the internal struggle waged by Japanese intellectuals was a struggle to liberate themselves from baseness. However, Chinese intellectuals, with the exception of a few progressives, have not raised this issue of internal struggle. So-called conscientious people are merely those who base their arguments on instinct and are mistakenly dominated by modern thought. The reason why this is at odds with the ideal of building Greater East Asia is due to Anglo-American concepts.</p>
<p>Declaration of War Clears Internal Unease</p>
<p>I deeply believe that the National Government's declaration of war on Britain and the United States has cleared away some of the unease harbored by some Chinese people. This great act of participating in the war has also reawakened their sense of national consciousness. China must be revived as a modern nation. This ideal is by no means a slogan, but a demand of life-and-death intuition. In short, intellectuals, because they possess the traditional spirit of East Asia, will surely understand Japan's true intentions after they possess a sense of national consciousness. They can only understand the meaning of Japan's holy war if they place themselves in the position of a nation. If a portion of people are still in a state of ideological unease, then it will be difficult for them to share the joys and sorrows with Japan. They may gladly enjoy the joys, but they will express their aversion to sharing the sorrows. Japan is waging war in order to expel the evil forces of Britain and the United States from East Asia. War is by no means an easy task and requires pain and sacrifice. Japan does not wish to trouble China, but now it is standing on the same cooperative battle line. We cannot help but express our deep joy at fighting alongside China. Therefore, on this point, we should trust Chinese intellectuals. At the same time, it would be a loss of dignity for our comrades on the same battle line if we were to protect them solely through our own fighting.</p>
<p>China and Japan Will Surely Win</p>
<p>Now that the Chinese intellectuals, who have grasped the ideological basis due to the declaration of war, lead the people and put into practice the sharing of hardships, they will surely be able to achieve victory together with Japan. The declaration of war has further enhanced the sense of national consciousness. Therefore, Chinese intellectuals also regard the ideal of building Greater East Asia as their own responsibility, and they can understand what the sacred purpose is. This is my observation. As for how to deal with the Anglo-American ideas that have influenced the Chinese people in the past, this is also the most important problem. Only this holy war can purify their thoughts and eliminate Anglo-American ideas. My conclusion is that the Chinese intellectuals after the participation in the war are the ones who will cooperate in carrying out the war and organize China's wartime system.</p>
<h3>Statement by Chen Jicheng, Ambassador to Manchukuo</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - National Government member Chen Jicheng has been appointed as the Republic of China's Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Manchukuo, as approved by the 148th meeting of the Executive Yuan. Yesterday, the reporter made a special visit to Mr. Chen, who gave the following statement: Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Manchukuo, two years have passed. Due to the changes in the situation, the relationship between the two countries has become increasingly close. Recently, the National Government participated in the Greater East Asia War, and in the declaration of war, it clearly stated that Manchukuo and Thailand have always maintained friendly relations and share a common desire for East Asian co-prosperity. In the future, we should further promote cooperation in order to jointly build a new East Asian order based on morality. I am assuming this arduous task at this moment, and I feel the great importance of my mission even more. I will certainly do my best, under the leadership of the Chairman, and in accordance with the spirit of the joint declaration of China, Japan, and Manchukuo, to work with our friendly nation of Manchukuo to enhance the friendship between the two countries, and to strive to concentrate all our efforts to assist in the completion of the Greater East Asia War, so that the new East Asian order based on morality can be established and achieved as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Report by Japanese Army and Navy Representatives on the Situation in the South Pacific: First Explanation of Last Year's Operations, Then Elaboration on the Strategic Significance of Guadalcanal</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - Japanese government officials, representing the Army and Navy, reported today on the war situation in the South Pacific at the House of Representatives budget general meeting. First, they explained the course of the operations, the gist of which was as follows: In the South Pacific, since August 7th of last year, when about one division of the US Marine Corps landed at Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and other places under the protection of a strong naval force, they made contact with the Japanese naval detachment stationed on Guadalcanal in late May that night. Upon receiving the report, the Japanese Army immediately dispatched a certain detachment and other forces to reinforce it. The first-line commander who was dispatched tried to grasp the war situation and inflict great blows and threats on the enemy, but ultimately failed to achieve the purpose of annihilating the enemy. Afterward, they further strengthened their forces and established a strategic base in the South Pacific. Furthermore, in order to provide a foundation for future large-scale operations, they were assigned the task of holding the enemy in check in that area. At that time, not only was the Japanese air force that cooperated with the ground operations on Guadalcanal quite limited, but the airfields that could cooperate were also very far from Guadalcanal, about 1,000 kilometers or more away. The enemy, on the other hand, used its mechanical power to build many airfields in a short period of time, and successively dispatched superior air forces, so that we failed to gain air supremacy in the Guadalcanal area. Since the enemy had the advantage in air supremacy, they further increased their forces and built solid fortifications around the airfield. Therefore, it was extremely difficult for our forces in the rear to attack these solid positions under the enemy's air supremacy and carry out long-distance attacks. Furthermore, the enemy forces in the New Guinea area were the joint US-Australian forces based in Australia. Since August of last year, the enemy has gradually increased the number of Australian troops stationed at Port Moresby. In early July of last year, a unit of our troops landed at Buna, and in early September, they broke through the Stanley Range and approached Port Moresby. However, due to logistical reasons, they were ordered to move to Buna and hold the area near the coastline. Like the Guadalcanal troops, they established a strategic base in the South Pacific in order to provide a foundation for establishing future large-scale operations, and were assigned the task of holding the enemy in check in that area. Therefore, for half a year, our officers and soldiers in Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands and near Buna in New Guinea overcame various difficulties in the hot and humid forest areas, and often attacked the enemy's counterattacks with a small number of troops. Regardless of any losses, they held their positions and held the enemy in check. In the meantime, they had secured various strategic bases from Burma through the Dutch East Indies to the Marshall Islands and beyond, and the deployment of troops had also been completed. They then elaborated on the strategic significance of the operations in the Guadalcanal and Buna areas, stating in essence that after capturing the important points of Greater East Asia, they entered the stage of pursuit. The vanguard of the pursuit troops pursued to Guadalcanal and Buna, where they engaged in encounter battles with the enemy. As a result, the communication route between Australia and the US mainland was greatly threatened. Therefore, the United States used short-distance supply lines and air bases to launch a full-scale counterattack. A part of our naval forces preemptively launched a landing on Guadalcanal and occupied a corner of the island. However, since the air base was occupied by the enemy, our side was at a strategic disadvantage, and maritime resupply was particularly difficult.</p>
<p>Japanese Main Force Completes Outer Wall of Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere</p>
<p>However, for half a year, we continued to fight hard, repeatedly attacking under this disadvantageous position. In the Solomon and New Guinea areas, we held back the full strength of the US Pacific naval, land, and air forces, allowing our main forces to complete strategic preparations from Burma through the Dutch East Indies, New Guinea, this part of the Solomons to the Marshalls and other areas, becoming the outer wall of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and securing a basis for future offensive operations. The reason why the strategic deployment of the main forces was so rapid and orderly was that it did not attract the world's attention. However, this strategic deployment was a difficult task that consolidated the outer wall of Greater East Asia. As a result, the communication route between the US and Australia felt threatened. By holding back the US forces on Guadalcanal for more than half a year, we were able to consolidate the entire area at our leisure. The US strategy was truly laughable. Next, they reported on why the troops in the Guadalcanal and Buna areas were withdrawn. In encounter battles, when the vanguard independently attacks important positions, the main force usually gradually joins the vanguard in fighting and attacking the enemy. However, sometimes the vanguard is allowed to fight in the forward positions, and after the main force completes its combat preparations, the vanguard is withdrawn to the main force's line. This tactic is called a retreating deployment. The encounter battle in the South Pacific was a retreating deployment. Next, they talked about: 1. The wise decision of the command; 2. The cooperation of the Army and Navy; 3. The hardships and merits of the troops.</p>
<p>Japanese People Strive to Unleash Strength, Strike America to Abandon Hostility</p>
<p>Finally, they revealed the purpose of the American war and expressed their confidence in victory as follows: Japan has never insulted the United States or damaged their rights, nor has it threatened the existence of the United States. However, they have wantonly despised and oppressed the Japanese people, and have jeopardized the existence of the Empire economically and militarily. In order to survive and defend ourselves, the Empire has risen up regardless of everything. After the outbreak of the war, Roosevelt said that his war aim was to uphold democracy, but the American people's will to fight was waning. Roosevelt fabricated the war aim, saying that this war was for survival. The most ridiculous thing was that on November 26th of last year, he issued a challenge to Japan, desperately inciting the American people's anti-Japanese sentiment, fabricating the war aim, and instilling anti-Japanese ideology, which proves that American politics has no justice or humanity. The word "violence" alone is enough to sum up American politics. As a result, the pure youth of America lost 20,000 to 30,000 lives on remote island forests in the South Pacific. In the future, they will also lose many battleships, aircraft carriers, and airplanes. In short, the more tyrannical the American commanders and the more unjust the politics, the more we must fight, unleash the strength of the Japanese people in front of them, and make them treat us with proper etiquette. Therefore, in the future, we must not only crush the enemy's counterattacks, but also strike at their heart, otherwise it will be difficult to make the arrogant Americans give up their will to fight. Through the efforts and struggles of 100 million citizens, we will continue to fight decisive battles on the battlefield, in factories, on farms, and in homes. If the American will to fight is not abandoned, we will make the heart of America suffer a great blow. We are now working hard to prepare.</p>

<p>Minister of Health and Welfare Reports on the Actual Situation of Population Growth</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - Japanese Minister of Health and Welfare Koizumi clarified the actual situation of Japan's population growth in response to a question raised by Congressman Akojima Shunji at the House of Representatives special administrative committee this afternoon. He stated that judging from the past history and the current situation, it can be proven that wars reduce the population. However, uniquely, Japan is seeing a trend of population growth while carrying out wars. At the end of the Meiji period, Japan's population increased by 32.3 people per year for every 1,000 people. By Taisho 9, the increase was 36 people per year for every 1,000 people. After that, it declined slightly, but in the Showa era, it increased by about 31.2 people per year for every 1,000 people. In Showa 13 and 14, it increased by 26 people per year for every 1,000 people. After Showa 15, it increased to 29 people, and the following year it rose to 31.2 people. Since that year, the population mortality rate has been extremely low. In the Taisho period, 21.2 people died per year for every 1,000 people, but in Showa 15, it decreased to 16.2 people, and in Showa 16, it decreased to 15 people. Therefore, the total number of natural population increase exceeded one million in Showa 16. As for the infant mortality rate, it was 9 people per 1,000 people in Showa 15 and 8 people in Showa 16, which is almost the same as the infant mortality rate in Germany, England, and other countries. Depending on the region in Japan, some regions have an infant mortality rate that is even lower than the level of 6 people in Germany, England, and other countries.</p>
<p>Director of Accounting Bureau Takei States Current Situation of Donations</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - Director of the Accounting Bureau of the Japanese Navy Ministry Takei stated this morning at the third subcommittee meeting of the House of Representatives budget committee that the current situation of national defense donations is as follows: From the Sino-Japanese Incident to January 22nd of this year, national defense donations from various places have reached over 158,355,000 yen, condolence money over 63,490,000 yen, academic encouragement money over 9,120,000 yen, and other consolation goods totaling over 11,920,000 yen, totaling over 242,590,000 yen.

<h3>Indian Mahatma Gandhi Decides to Fast for 21 Days</h3>
<p>American Envoy's Activities in India Quite Forceful; Meets Separately with Key Figures from All Sides in India</p>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Allied Press Urgent Telegram) - According to information from Poona, Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi, 74, has decided to fast for 21 days and has already begun. Gandhi has been detained at the Aga Khan Palace in Poona since his arrest on August 8th of last year, because the All-India National Congress passed a resolution to expel the British from India at a meeting in Bombay.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Allied Press telegram) - According to a report from Poona, Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi began a fast this morning to protest the All-India National Congress Party's failure to take responsibility for the Indian riots and his continued detention by the British side after December 8th of last year. This is the sixth fast of his life. The Governor-General wrote a letter blaming him for not using fasting as a political threat, stating that this action has no moral justification. The British authorities firmly stated that they do not intend to retreat on Gandhi's demand for release, and that he should be responsible for fasting while in detention. Gandhi refused to eat breakfast this morning. When the official announcement of this news was made, he had been fasting for six hours.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - Roosevelt's special envoy Phillips' trip to India this time is an attempt to pull India into the Anglo-American camp and expand its influence in England. Therefore, he has made various attempts in New Delhi. According to recent news received here, Phillips went to Punjab and met with the Chief Minister of the state to conduct important talks, and met with the leader of the Punjab branch of the National Congress Party, Dhani Ram, and made some attempts. Ever since the US sent an economic delegation to India headed by Clay in May of last year, the US policy of co-opting India has become increasingly apparent. Phillips' mission to India on Roosevelt's orders can be said to have reached its highest point in expressing its ambition. Phillips' mission is nothing more than to have the United States inherit Britain's legacy in India, but Britain, represented by Governor-General Linlithgow, has no ability to eliminate his plot. The fact that Phillips met separately with Indians from all sides, such as Pulla Sapa, President of the All-India National Liberal Federation, in New Delhi, where the Indian Governor-General's residence is located, without regard to the existence of the Indian Governor-General, proves this.</p>
<h3>Snippets from the "Council of State" in Chongqing - Transmitted from Macau on January 29th</h3>
<p>According to reports, the first session of the third "Council of State" in Chongqing convened on October 22nd of the 31st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1942], lasting for ten days. Looking back today, although it feels like reviewing yesterday's news, these scattered glimpses still offer a lingering sense of interest.</p>
<p>Councilor Gu Jiegang, upon arriving at seat number 195, searched anxiously for his books, only to later realize, with Councilor Wang Yinzhi's arrival, that it was Wang's seat. His own seat was actually in the same row, but in the first three rows. The confusion and mistake caused him great alarm, and the two couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>Many councilors greeted each other in the morning with the question, "Where did you hide during last night's air raid alert?"</p>
<p>After the afternoon session, Councilors Yang Duanliu and Chen Yuan, unable to board a vehicle, had to walk back to their residence.</p>
<p>Gu Jiegang encountered Huang Yanpei and repeatedly greeted him with "Congratulations, congratulations," to which Huang responded with a smile.</p>
<p>Councilor Hadeer, from Xinjiang, could barely speak Mandarin but was fluent in English and French, having studied in Syria.</p>
<p>Female Councilor Tang Guozhen actively engaged inside and outside the meeting venue during the ten-minute break, seeking co-signatures for her proposal. One of the proposals concerned increasing salaries for university professors. ("University professors are even worse off than primary school teachers," was a point of great concern for Councilor Tang.)</p>
<p>Chen Lifu, when discussing the lives of primary school teachers, stated that their monthly salary was about 62 yuan, plus two dou of rice (also worth 62 yuan), for a total monthly income of 124 yuan.</p>
<p>Female Councilor Zhang Bangzhen inquired about the lack of teachers and unavailable textbooks. Tong Guanxian, Peng Ge and Chen inquired about student malnutrition and students carrying firearms in schools and engaging in unlawful behavior. Mr. Chen prepared to respond to all these inquiries in writing.</p>
<p>In one educational inquiry regarding the low level of primary school teachers, the following incident was mentioned: A certain county magistrate, while on inspection tour, found that the local primary school teacher, in an attempt to show the people's welcome to the magistrate, posted slogans everywhere. One of them read "The county magistrate's spirit never dies," causing laughter throughout the hall.</p>
<p>Wei Zhiguang, the director of the central labor administration, planned to propose a bill for "special medical expenses for civil servants and staff" to the assembly. As Wei said, "Who can afford to get sick these days? If the government doesn't come up with some solutions for these people within a reasonable scope, they will just have to wait to die when they get sick!"</p>
<p>A proposal suggesting that students must read the "Great Learning," the "Doctrine of the Mean," and the "Analects" and that universities should establish institutes for studying classical texts sparked heated debate. The initial review stated "reserved", Councilor Liu Hengjing agreed with the reservation, stating as a reason that "reading old books will only create fake antiques." Councilor Peng Yunyi asked, "Isn't the "Fuxing Academy" already studying classical texts?" Councilor Tao Xuan, addressing Councilor Liu Hengjing's point of view, stated, "China needs personality training, China should promote its inherent moral education, and reading old books will not turn people into antiques." Councilor Li Zhongxiang, Councilor Jiang Yiping, and Councilor Chu Fucheng all expressed agreement with and opposition to the opinions. The result was that the proposition to make "The Great Learning", "The Doctrine of the Mean" and "The Analects" compulsory extracurricular reading was passed and sent to the government for adoption and implementation.</p>
<p>After the proposal to promote reading the classics was passed, Councilor Wang Hanzhu suddenly stood up and declared, "Even if you revoke my qualification as a councilor, I must speak." He argued that the word "compulsory" should not be added to "extracurricular." However, after others informed him that it was possible to add "compulsory" to "extracurricular," Wang remained silent.</p>
<p>Councilors also engaged in a lively discussion regarding the loan issue for students from war zones. The proposer stated, "Prisoners in jail have all their living expenses covered by the state. Even before they are executed, they are given a full meal. Why should students from war zones have their loans canceled simply because of poor academic performance, thus cutting off their livelihood?" The listeners were moved by this.</p>
<p>Regarding Councilor Luo Heng's proposal to abolish the Relief and Rehabilitation Committee, Councilor Chou Ao strongly argued against it. Luo stood up and gave a very long explanation, pointing out as many as fourteen shortcomings of the Relief and Rehabilitation Committee, and stating that anyone who argued against this proposal was protecting the committee. Councilor Tao Xuan, one of those who opposed Luo's proposal, specifically reminded everyone, "Don't let Luo's arguments lock up our mouths like a lock." Councilor Huang Yuren jokingly said, "I'm afraid people will say I'm being locked up by a lock, so I have to speak. My opinion is to maintain the review opinion." For a while, Councilor Jiang Yiping, Councilor Kong Geng, and Councilor Wang Liming all remained silent. The result was that the proposal was revised and sent to the government for investigation and action.</p>
<p>Among the councilors was a one-legged gentleman, Zhang Tong, and a one-armed gentleman, Liang Shangdong.</p>
<p>The various review committees at this session were extremely busy, especially the fourth and fifth groups. The fourth review committee (finance, economy, transportation) even worked overtime until the 30th of the month to deal with various important cases. All the councilors felt "overwhelmed." At each conference, the second review committee (international diplomacy) was the most idle, hence the nickname "lazy group." However, this time it had twelve proposals to review, but it finished in less than six hours.</p>
<p>The trend of councilors freely leaving the session had not diminished. Some councilors sitting in the back row would often move to the spectator seats to chat with guests.</p>
<p>Councilor Chen Yiyun was greatly dissatisfied upon hearing reports that in war zones, married women who had been separated from their husbands for five years could remarry without the government recognizing it as bigamy. He inquired with Xie Guansheng, the Minister of Judicial Administration, who replied in writing, stating that there was no such thing.</p>
<p>It was reported that the Council of State received a total of 250 proposals, 92 of which concerned economic and financial matters, including 27 related to price issues, reflecting the nationwide concern about prices.</p>
<h3>Current Stage of the German-Soviet War - The Battle for Rostov Reaches a Critical Juncture</h3>
<p>Everywhere on the bitterly cold German-Soviet winter front, covered in frost and snow, fierce battles are unfolding, attracting significant attention. The German authorities also acknowledge the gravity of the situation and are urging their citizens to develop a new awareness. The current stage of the German-Soviet war is observed by synthesizing reports from various locations.</p>
<p>Along the vast German-Soviet front, stretching from the Leningrad area in the north to the North Caucasus in the south, the Soviet side has launched a counteroffensive despite suffering heavy losses. Last autumn, as the battle for Stalingrad intensified, the Soviet high command appointed Marshal Zhukov (then a Corps General), commander of the Central Front, as the supreme commander. He led fifty reserve divisions, awaiting an opportunity to strike the German rear during the winter. The Germans were aware of this plan from the beginning and had the Sixth Army and a part of the Romanian army build strong fortifications in the occupied area of Stalingrad, demonstrating their determination to fight resolutely on the Volga River.</p>
<p>On November 19th, the Soviet forces, which had been waiting for this moment, launched their operation from the northwest and southwest of Stalingrad, opening the prelude to the winter campaign in the area between the Volga and Don rivers. Subsequently, on November 25th, in the Central Front's Garinine northwest of Elziv, Toropetz, and Verikiel, on December 16th in the Bokocher, Nobelier, and Garitope regions of the middle Don, and in January in the Mozdok and Nari Zhetge regions of the central North Caucasus, and in the Leningrad eastern Ladojia Southern Lake regions, the Soviet forces took counteroffensive postures. In the fierce battles between the attacking and defending armies, progress was made in the southern war zone, with the major battlefield having a radius of 180 to 80 kilometers, centered on Voroshilov and Rostov.</p>
<p>The direction of the Soviet counteroffensive in this southern war zone was, in the northernmost region near Voronezh, commanded by General Gorlikov, and aimed at capturing Voronezh and advancing towards Kharkiv. In the middle reaches of the Don River, Lieutenant General Rokossovsky's troops crossed the Don River, with one part advancing from Staire Lisk towards the north of Voroshilovgrad, and another part heading south along the Moscow-Rostov railway through Millerovo to Minsk Leovsky, advancing towards the north of Rostov. Another group came out of the Kutsirini Gov region from the southwest of Stalingrad along the Stalingrad, Tsiolek, and Novo Rossiysk railway. General Airmenko's right-wing forces concentrated near the point where the Don and Donets rivers diverge, near Konstantinov Pusko, keeping an eye on the east of Rostov. The front line advanced towards Rostov along the north bank of the Manuichi Canal, and the left wing advanced west from Salisk, echoing the forces advancing north from the North Caucasus to attack Tsiolek, a key point in the south of Rostov.</p>
<p>Thus, what is the target of the Soviet counteroffensive on the southern front? First, Rostov, to cut off the connection between the German forces in the North Caucasus and eastern Ukraine, and to encircle and recapture the Donbas mining and industrial area from both the north and south, and to retake Kharkiv. Voronezh was first captured by the German forces in July last year when they began their summer offensive, and from there they controlled the important areas of Kursk and Kharkiv in the west.</p>
<p>The Soviet army took advantage of the opportunity of the slightly reduced severity of the winter to use tank groups as the main force of the attack, launching successive attacks on the German positions with tenacious attacks. Marshal Timoshenko, the loser of the southern front, was replaced by the young General Vatutin as commander, who, together with Marshal Zhukov, commanded 800,000 troops in a major counteroffensive.</p>
<p>The scale of the counteroffensive on the northern front in the central region was smaller than that in the south, but it regained the Hilleselipurgo and Veriki-Erji districts at the southern end of Lake Latga. The flank operations of the southern war front gradually became deadlocked due to the German counteroffensive after transferring to a new position in mid-January. However, the Soviet Union's propaganda that the attempt to regain Hilleselipurgo was intended to relieve Leningrad.</p>
<p>The German forces on the southern war front, led by Field Marshal Manstein, the brave conqueror of Sevastopol, replacing Field Marshal Bock, conducted a flexible retreat and defensive deployment, forming a strong new trapezoidal position facing the Soviet army in the rear of the war front, owing to last winter's defensive battles. Because the extension of the front line was quite vast, the front line and the rear had to maintain a very long supply line, which was obviously at a disadvantage. Therefore, Rostov and Kharkiv were connected to form a line, and they were held as strongholds as a starting point for the offensive in the coming spring. Therefore, according to the German authorities, the stubborn defense of the strongholds in the center of each front is not a matter of maintaining the line, and the desperate battle of the Sixth Army, which is now isolated in Stalingrad, also shows the German plan for the future of the war. The battle for Rostov is now the most critical juncture in this winter campaign. The geographical value of Rostov is of great importance to the future of the war between Germany and the Soviet Union. Especially for the Soviet army, isn't it now pouring all its elite forces into a decisive battle under the conditions of winter to defend the Volga and the Caucasus? The taste of the current stage of the war is significantly different from the situation during the Soviet counteroffensive last winter, roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Last winter, the severe cold was another 40 degrees below zero, and the average climate in central and southern Russia this year is about 25 degrees.</p>
<p>(2) The Soviet Union hoped to bring all the reserve troops training in the rear together and concentrate them in the southern war zone, starting operations before the completion of the German winter front-line positions.</p>
<p>(3) The international situation in North Africa has changed, and a part of the military has already moved.</p>
<p>However, this Soviet counteroffensive was blocked by the German army's ability to defend and fight well. In a blink of an eye, the spring and summer when the front line will be active will soon arrive. At that time, the Soviet Union will be shocked by its own losses. The German authorities now frankly admit that part of the Eastern Front war situation has been lost. At the same time, the new sharp troops who have been fully prepared after General Winter and General Mud have passed are about to appear. The current Eastern Front war situation can show one end of the German authorities' determination. (Xiang: Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, February 1)</p>

<h3>Soviet Troops Surge into Kursk from Northeast and Northwest - Fierce Fighting Still Underway in the City - Entire Toropitz Soviet Team Annihilated</h3>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Haitong Agency) - Extreme cold on the Southern Route of the Eastern Front. The construction of German fortifications is also hampered by the cold. Soviet soldiers, accustomed to the cold and far outnumbering the Germans, are in a superior position compared to the German army. Today, the center of the Soviet offensive remains in the middle reaches of the Donets River, but its pressure on other points has also increased. According to reports last night, Soviet troops have surged into Kursk from the northeast and northwest, and fierce fighting is still underway in the city. Soviet troops in the lower reaches of the Donets River, which had been quiet for many days, have begun to move again, but have not yet achieved any success. Enemy troops on the other side of the Don River have repeatedly tried to cross without success. There is also fierce fighting in the Krasnodar and Novorossiysk areas. The enemy's heavy troops are still concentrated in the middle reaches of the Donets River, but there has been no significant advance, it is said.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Haitong Agency) - The central part of the Donets River was also the center of fierce fighting on the Eastern Front yesterday. The Soviet army launched successive attacks, and the German army fought hard against it. The intensity of the battle was even greater than last winter, but the German army did not engage in positional warfare with it, so the enemy army had a possibility of breaking into our army's position, but the danger of being annihilated by our army was also extremely great. There was also fierce fighting in the Novorossiysk area yesterday. There were no major battles in the Rostov area yesterday.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Haitong Agency) - According to reports here last night, fierce fighting is still underway in the Kursk region. Under the snow and wind, the Soviet army launched as many as fifteen attacks on the German defense line outside the city.

On Tuesday morning, the German army launched another counterattack, and the battle is now underway.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Haitong Agency) - The battle between the German army southeast of Toropitz in the central part of the Eastern Front and a Soviet team of 2,000 men ended on February 7. The entire Soviet team was annihilated, and the German army captured a large number of war materials.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) - The German authorities explained the war situation on the Eastern Front on the 9th. The most prominent fact of the recent Eastern Front war situation is that the Soviet army is continuously opening up the front with a large number of reserve troops, while the German army's counterattacks are also extremely fierce. The situation in the Kursk area has been quite serious for several days. The Soviet army has been constantly attacking the north and east of the city in recent days, and fierce fighting is currently underway in the outer areas of the city. There is also fierce fighting in the northwest of the Donets River. The Soviet offensive has been greatly slowed down due to the German army's fierce counterattacks and flank attacks. The Soviet army is now concentrating large forces to increase pressure from Slavyansk to Mariupol on the coast of the Taganrog Bay.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) - The German High Command announced the war situation on the 9th: Eastern Front (1) The Soviet army's counterattack in the southern part of the Eastern Front is becoming more and more fierce, and it has repeatedly attempted to break through the German position with powerful troops, but all have been repelled by the German army. (2) Although the German army in the Don River estuary has been actively counterattacked by the Soviet army, it is still progressing smoothly under favorable conditions. In the area west of the Antonetsos Al of the lower reaches of the Don River, the Soviet army launched a full-scale counterattack and engaged in a fierce battle with the German army, but it has been repelled. The German army is also conducting counterattacks to stop the Soviet army from advancing, and fierce fighting is still underway in the area. Although the German army is under severe weather conditions, it is still bravely resisting and holding on to its original position. (3) The Soviet army in the southern part of Lake Litor also launched several counterattacks, but was also severely damaged and collapsed.</p>

<p>Budapest, 10th (Haitong Agency) - Hungarian semi-official reports reveal that the joint defensive war of the German and Allied forces on the Eastern Front has achieved important results.

At the same time, Germany is extremely satisfied with the work of foreign workers.</p>

<p>Rome, 9th (Havas News Agency) - The Italian Daily recently published a commentary saying that the victory of the Axis submarines is not due to the lack of production in Britain and the United States, and there is no way to prevent it, but because there are too many German and Italian submarines. From the Arctic Ocean to the South Atlantic, the defense line is vast, and it is impossible to prevent it. Although January every year is the season of shocking waves and swift waves, German and Italian submarines still sank 700,000 tons of enemy ships last month, while British and American ships sunk by the Japanese army in the Pacific and Indian Oceans are not included.

<p>The Fierce and Unmatched Japanese Navy Air Force</p>
<h3>On-the-Spot Report by American War Correspondent: Deification of Japanese Military Combat Skills - Using Ingenuity to Make Themselves Elusive - Charging into Combat and Treating Danger as Nothing</h3>
<p>The attempt by the main force of the US military to carry out a desperate battle in the Southwest Pacific was shattered by the continuous counterattacks of the Japanese army. Throughout the United States, the magnitude of the sacrifices and the depth of the blows were shuddering, and people increasingly felt the "terror of the Japanese army." An American reporter on the front line in that area made the following report on the Japanese army's unpredictable, brave, and decisive combat in the jungle, which attracted widespread attention. The bravery of the Japanese army in the Southwest Pacific is like that of a tiger in the forest. Former Ambassador to Japan, Grew, based on his past experience, said: "The Japanese army is a formidable enemy of the United States." The Japanese army does not like to fight defensive battles but often takes the offensive. Their melee attacks, with their spirit of charging forward and never retreating, often terrify the US military, leaving them at a loss. In forest warfare, both sides are buried in piles of ancient green leaves, and the distance between the two sides is only a few feet. In such difficult and dangerous circumstances, the Japanese army skillfully uses camouflage tactics to achieve great results, often firing at the enemy from secret locations, and the enemy simply does not know where the bullets are coming from. This tactic is especially used in night battles, making it impossible for the enemy to grasp their own location, often causing illusions. Japanese soldiers often call out the names of American soldiers in a low voice, such as Smith or Brown. Infantrymen on guard duty in the forest, exhausted, actually think that their squad leader or company commander is approaching. If they are even slightly careless and answer, they are simply telling the enemy where they are, and then they are suddenly attacked. They also often hum popular American songs and sneak into American military positions. In order to prevent the enemy from noticing the sound of rubbing against trees when the troops move through the forest, the army often imitates the cries of birds and beasts, or the roar of lions, to startle and confuse the American army. Before they are even aware, the flying generals have descended from the sky. When the Japanese army moves, they are silent, as light and quiet as a raccoon dog. You can't hear a sound, and you can't see a shadow.</p>
<p>The Japanese army often uses a small unit to suddenly appear in front of the American army. The American army, of course, immediately starts firing, but the main force of the Japanese army, lurking to one side, unexpectedly launches a fierce attack on the American army, catching them off guard and wiping them out. The American army is also often subjected to a sudden attack directly into the heart from the front, while simultaneously encountering a deadly blow. Night raids are even more tragic. During one attack on an American position, the Japanese army first used large bombers with sun symbols on both wings to bomb the American position fiercely. Immediately, Japanese soldiers suddenly appeared from the forest, charging from both sides, shouting "Banzai," throwing grenades, and waving Japanese swords, rushing in like a raging tide. No matter how hard you try to defend, those in the back keep coming one after another. In the darkness, they engage in a desperate melee battle with grenades, pistols, and bayonets, finally breaking into a corner of the American position, starting to sweep with machine guns, and continuing the brutal fighting.</p>
<p>During these two days of fierce fighting, three Japanese soldiers, one of whom was an officer, suddenly jumped out of the forest, shouting "Banzai," and waving their swords, broke into the headquarters of American commander, Major General Bundacliff. The headquarters was unprepared, and this attack was completely unexpected. These three Japanese soldiers killed dozens of American soldiers, and the commander barely escaped with his life, fleeing into the depths of the forest. Because of this battle, the bravery of the Japanese army caused the entire American army to shudder. The Japanese army's equipment is extremely suitable for forest warfare. The Japanese army effectively uses mortars and other military equipment, and the exquisite mortars and grenades are very light and easy to carry. One person can carry them, and can fire the mortar after bracing it on the knee. The Japanese army also has flame throwers, and its grenades are also more powerful than those used by the American army.</p>
<p>The Japanese army's rifles are extremely accurate, and the grenades used to deal with the war are very powerful. The soldiers who throw them often even use themselves as human bombs, approaching tanks and detonating together. The Japanese army also has many steel boots, which they use to climb coconut trees and snipe at the enemy from above, which is extremely brave and well-trained. American commander, Major General Bundacliff, sighed and said: "If we do not abandon obsolete military tactics and adopt new tactics, there is no hope of victory." The Japanese army treats difficulties and dangers that other armies would consider impossible as nothing, and marches forward bravely. This kind of battle is still continuing fiercely. The enemy is extremely tenacious and full of confidence. It is worrying whether we can reap great results from the Japanese army in this area."

<h3>French Concession Revises Household Registration; Residents Must Not Conceal; Movement Must Be Reported to the Baojia Office; Violators Will Be Fined 30 Yuan</h3>
<p>In order to thoroughly investigate and clarify the accurate number of residents in the concession and to detect any suspicious individuals, the Baojia authorities of the French Concession have decided to revise the household registration. This matter is now actively underway. Household registration forms have been distributed by the authorities in each district to the Baojia offices under their jurisdiction. After obtaining these household survey forms, residents must fill them out in detail and must not conceal, falsely report, or misreport. Furthermore, recently, the Baojia authorities have noted that residents often do not report their movement to the Baojia office, resulting in discrepancies between the household registration and the information filled in on the household registration form. In the future, if it is discovered during the revision of household registration that there has been movement of households that has not been reported to the Baojia authorities, a fine of 30 yuan will be imposed and no leniency will be granted. Residents are urged to pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Careful Handling of Overdrafts Between Exchange Firms; Old Customers Begin Sending Current Account Books</h3>

The overdraft quota must be stipulated for overdrafts, and a guarantee from a person with a good credit history is required. Recently, each firm has begun to send current account books to old customers with reliable credit, allowing them to do business. As for the interest on deposits and debts, it will be calculated in accordance with the market price announced by the association each month. It is reported that the association has scheduled a general meeting of members of each firm on February 17th at the North City Conference to celebrate the Lunar New Year. In addition to offering sacrifices to the former directors, the association will also report on matters related to business innovation.</p>
<h3>United Relief Association of Charities, New Initiatives for Poverty Alleviation: Already Established an Almshouse and a Ciji Children's Home</h3>
<p>In order to provide relief to orphans, widows, impoverished men, women, disabled elderly, and poor children on the streets, the Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Relief Association, in addition to continuing to set up shelters as usual, has recently established an almshouse and a Ciji Children's Home in accordance with the principle of human mutual assistance. The reporter has learned the details and recorded them as follows:</p>
<p>More Than 800 Orphans, Widows, and Disabled</p>
<p>The almshouse is located on the site of the Tongren Fuyuan Hall Public Cemetery at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Qipu Road. Several sheds have been built. As of yesterday, it has taken in more than 100 elderly men and women who have no home to return to, more than 80 disabled men and women, more than 80 elderly widows, more than 200 orphans, and more than 200 extremely poor men and women, for a total of more than 800 people.</p>
<p>Accepting Beggar Children; Half Work, Half Study</p>
<p>The Ciji Children's Home is located at the same location as above and specializes in taking in beggar children from the streets. To date, it has more than 300 children. They are divided into half work and half study on weekdays, receiving half a day of adequate education and guiding the cattle in production work in order to cultivate skilled talents. With regard to the almshouse, most of the women go out to work, about 100 people, divided into sewing, picking tea leaves, and rolling cotton clothes.</p>
<p>Handicraft Income, Small But Helpful</p>
<p>Another part of the men and women work indoors, about 200 people, including more than 50 people knitting velvet yarn gloves and weaving colored wax yarn mesh bags. Each day, they can knit 60 dozen mesh bags, which are specially sold to Wing On, Sincere, New Wing On, The Sun, China National Products Company, and major stores. On average, each person can earn between 3 and 5 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes per day. However, elderly women are unable to do manual labor and specialize in pasting tattered cloth shoe linings, which can also generate some income.</p>
<p>Shelters Have Six Sheds</p>
<p>The 11th Shelter is currently located on Alabaster Road and has six sheds. It has been open since the 1st of this month and has taken in 213 extremely poor men and women who are stranded on the streets. The cost of providing supplies is about 20,000 yuan per month, for a total cost of 40,000 yuan for the two months until the end of March, all of which is funded by the Seventh District Public Welfare Association and the Chinese Red Swastika Society.</p>
<p>It is reported that the association's statistics show that the monthly expenses for the almshouse and the Ciji Children's Home are about 60,000 yuan. In addition to a small subsidy from the Disease Relief Association, the shortfall is significant.</p>
<h3>Siren Alarm Test This Afternoon</h3>
<p>Shanghai (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Naval Fleet Headquarters in China has scheduled to test the air raid sirens this afternoon (11th) from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM for one hour. Citizens of the city are asked to pay attention.</p>
<p>The Japanese authorities will test the siren alarm on the afternoon of the 11th of this month from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM, with two long sounds lasting 12 seconds each, separated by 15 seconds. These siren sounds will continue to be rehearsed several times. It is hoped that the public will not misunderstand them as real air raid alarms.</p>
<h3>96 Insurance Companies Registered in This City</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry, in view of the recent rapid development of the insurance industry and the emergence of new companies like bamboo shoots after a rain, has specially established the National Insurance Supervision Bureau in Shanghai to protect the assets of merchants and residents. All insurance companies that are established and operating must apply to the bureau for registration and obtain a license before they are allowed to operate. Since then, new insurance companies have continued to prepare for establishment in this city in recent months. Observing the progress of the industrial and commercial promotion in Shanghai, the large number of insurance companies seems to be excessive. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry specifically issued a clear order last year to ban the registration and operation of insurance companies established after December 18th of last year. It is reported that the Insurance Supervision Bureau has now approved the registration and operation of 96 insurance companies. Recent applications for registration have been rejected.</p>
<h3>Fruit and Vegetable Industry to Implement Rationing</h3>
<p>In order to prevent price increases and fix prices, the fruit and vegetable industry in this city has been issued certificates by the Public Works Department and the Association Course to organize the "Fruit and Vegetable Retailers Association." According to reports from the Datong News Agency, in the future, all fruits and vegetables sold by each fruit and vegetable seller in this city will be rationed by the joint organization.</p>
<h3>At the Reception for Reporters at the Japanese Embassy, Director-General Hanasui of the Currency Agency Gave a Talk on the Central Reserve Bank Notes; The Current Exchange Rate for Central Reserve Bank Notes and Military Scrip Remains Unchanged; Rumors of New Currency Are Pure Nonsense</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy held its customary reception for the press in this city on the 8th floor of the Cathay Hotel at 3:00 PM on the 9th. Those present included Information Director Hirota of the Embassy, Acting Director-General of the Financial Bureau Eiji Hanasui, and more than 20 reporters from various newspapers in this city. First, Mr. Hanasui gave a talk on currency issues, stating: "Currently, there are two types of currency in China, the Central Reserve Bank Notes and the Military Scrip. The exchange rate is 18 yuan in Military Scrip for 100 yuan in Central Reserve Bank Notes. This was jointly announced by Minister Zhou of Finance and Financial Officer Ohara when old currency was banned last year, stating that the exchange rate would never be changed. This has remained unchanged to this day.</p>
<p>No Consideration of Changing Currency</p>
<p>However, recently, rumors have repeatedly arisen in Shanghai, claiming that the value of Central Reserve Bank Notes may change, or that the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry will issue Greater East Asia Securities to replace Central Reserve Bank Notes. All of these are pure nonsense. The Chinese and Japanese authorities have never considered changing the existing currency, and there is no possibility of realizing such a fact. The Chinese and Japanese authorities have already created a good foundation for the existing Central Reserve Bank Notes and have no need to issue new currency to replace them. Especially after the Greater East Asia War, not only the people in Central China will regard it as the only unified currency, but also South China and other places. After the National Government joined the war, China and Japan are fighting under the same position and the same ideals. People in both countries hope for final victory. Finance is even more important than the war. Therefore, Japan especially hopes that the Central Reserve Bank Notes can further consolidate its foundation and stabilize its circulation. Japanese Minister Aoki also clarified that 'The exchange rate between Central Reserve Bank Notes and Japanese currency will be jointly maintained by the two countries and will not be changed. In the past, the purchase of materials in various departments in China was exchanged with Military Scrip, but now it can be exchanged with Central Reserve Bank Notes, the purpose of which is to fully circulate the Central Reserve Bank Notes.' Minister Aoki was once the highest economic advisor in China, and his maintenance and consolidation of the value of the Central Reserve Bank Notes is inevitable. The rumors circulating in Shanghai can be dispelled from now on.</p>
<p>China and Japan Strive for Circulation of Materials</p>
<p>Mr. Hanasui briefly expressed his views on the issue of materials, saying: 'Although I am not directly involved in prices, I specialize in currency. Fluctuations in currency will cause riots in materials. Regarding this point, the phenomenon of material turmoil in Shanghai is actually caused by the interior. The turmoil in the interior of the guerrilla areas has affected Shanghai, causing prices to rise sharply. Enabling materials to flow smoothly in the future is the only way to stabilize prices. Recently, the National Government and the Japanese authorities have agreed to promote the mutual circulation of materials between the interior and Shanghai. It is expected that a specific plan will be announced soon. It can be expected that the agricultural production this year is unusually abundant, increasing by 30% compared with previous years. The cotton in North China has also doubled. These abundant materials can be supplied continuously, and the phenomenon of turmoil can be suppressed in the future. In addition, China can be self-sufficient in coarse grains and cotton. The lack of rice, sugar, and South Asian rubber and oil will be handled by Japan in the future to avoid the worry of shortages.' Then, Information Director Hirota made a brief report on the issue of the return of the concessions and the world situation in the past week.</p>
<p>Developing Enemy Property, Can Be Used</p>
<p>Hanasui also stated that Minister Zhou raised important issues in Shanghai: (1) to expand productivity; (2) to enrich the Central Reserve Bank Notes. The Japanese side also considers them to be important issues. Recently, Japan has returned new enemy property worth approximately 5.1 billion yuan in Central Reserve Bank Notes. China can fully utilize the recovery and management of this asset and further solve the above two major problems. He also said that due to the relationship of war, the currency of any country is showing a wartime phenomenon. But we should adopt the spirit of active construction, cherish the national currency, and protect its legal value. Do not have a critical and skeptical attitude. Then, he answered various questions raised by the reporters. At 5:30 PM, tea and refreshments were served and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Vaccination by Household in the French Concession's McLane District</h3>
<p>In order to care for the health of the people and ensure public sanitation, the authorities in the two concessions have successively implemented vaccination programs. However, many ignorant residents often avoid them. The police station and Baojia district authorities in the French Concession's McLane district, in light of this, have decided to implement vaccination by household to achieve universal vaccination and maintain sanitation within the district. The Baojia heads will work with the doctors to administer the vaccinations. Preparations have been completed, and the work will begin soon. It is said that other districts will also implement this successively.</p>
<h3>First Phase of Flour Distribution Begins Yesterday in West Shanghai</h3>
<p>The first phase of this year's flour distribution based on population in the West Shanghai district has officially begun yesterday (the 10th), with the district authorities working with more than sixty rice shops in the three neighborhoods within the district. Each person receives one catty and four taels of flour, sold for two yuan and seventy-five fen in national currency. Residents within the district are enthusiastically receiving their allocations from the various rice shops. Residents who have not yet received their allocation can go to the designated rice shops with their first phase flour purchase certificates to collect it.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Calligraphy Symposium</h3>
<p>Our country has always been known as a land of culture. The evolution of Chinese characters has a history of thousands of years. From tadpole script to Great Seal script, Small Seal script, and inscriptions on bronzes, oracle bones, and stone drums, all evolved from the Seal script. After the Han Dynasty, the Clerical script flourished again. Subsequently, the Cursive script, Running script, and Regular script gradually developed with the changing times. Therefore, calligraphy is valued as a specialized academic discipline by the literati and is listed as a required subject. Moreover, writing can express a person's personality, cultivate temperament, and nurture the body and mind. Calligraphy, in particular, has a profound effect. Therefore, those who study calligraphy must undergo academic examination in order to advance. China and Japan share the same writing system, and it is necessary to study the art of calligraphy together. The Shanghai branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, recognizing this, is holding a Sino-Japanese calligraphy symposium at the Japanese-Chinese Club branch of the Cathay Hotel at 2:30 PM on the 13th of this month to promote the exchange of art between the two countries and to study calligraphy. The Chinese side has invited Wang Ge Yi, Bai Jiao, Lu Shi Qian Ji Shou Zheng, Wu Dong Mo, Zong Lu Gu Zhang Yan Chang Ma Gong Yu, Xia Jing Guan, Deng Fen Weng, and others. The Japanese side has invited Matsumura, Otani, Fujita Jyoichi, Takahashi Yasui, and about twenty others. All are well-known figures in the calligraphy world of both China and Japan.</p>
<h3>Cause of the Fire at the "Welcoming Sun Building" in Hardoon Garden Determined; Electric Stove Boiling Water Caused Short Circuit; Luo Yunzhi Sentenced to Six Months</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 25th of last month, at about 2:00 AM, a sudden fire broke out at the Welcoming Sun Building inside Hardoon Garden (also known as Ai Li Garden) at 1273 Jing'an Temple Road. At that time, the wind fanned the flames, making it difficult to extinguish. It was not until dawn that the fire was extinguished by the fire brigade. However, the magnificent Welcoming Sun Building was completely destroyed. Fortunately, the more than 200 residents of the entire building were alerted early enough to avoid casualties. However, the estimated losses amounted to no less than one or two million yuan. After the incident, the Jing'an Temple police station in charge ordered an investigation into the cause of the fire. It was found that Luo Lingzhi (34 years old, from Shanghai), the adopted granddaughter of the late Hardoon Garden hostess, Luo Jialing, had returned to her room after finishing a mahjong game that evening. She boiled water on an electric stove in front of her bed to make tea. However, while boiling the water, Luo talked with Nara, the eldest adopted daughter of Luo Jialing, causing the water to boil over, damaging the electric wires, and causing a short circuit, which led to the disaster. The police station believed that Luo was not without fault and should be held responsible for the crime of arson under the criminal law. Therefore, she was arrested and prosecuted by the First Special Court for the crime of arson. Yesterday, after hearing the case, the Special Court sentenced Luo Yunzhi to six months of imprisonment for arson and destruction of a residence used by people. If she chooses to pay a fine in lieu of imprisonment, it will be calculated at three yuan per day. Luo expressed her willingness to accept the sentence.</p>
<h3>Zhao Guangfu, the Major Criminal Who Assassinated Tang Jiapeng, Dies</h3>
<p>Zhao Guangfu, a notorious thief from Yangzhou, was 38 years old this year. He was originally a carpenter. In the summer of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), he was instigated by others to collude with accomplices to shoot and kill Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World amusement park. He then used the gun used to kill Tang to form a gang and commit robberies, and was arrested. The Tang case was tried three times, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment. This case caused a sensation at the time. Later, Zhao was transferred to the second prison under the jurisdiction of Beixinjing to serve his sentence. During the August 13th Incident, he was transferred to the rear to serve in the military. He took the opportunity to escape back to Shanghai and continued his life of theft and robbery. He was arrested by the Public Concession police and found to be an escaped convict from the previous case. He was transferred to the Second Special District Prison by the Third High Court to continue serving his sentence. He was granted amnesty and a reduction in his sentence the year before last, and his sentence was reduced to 15 years in prison. Zhao suffered from beriberi in prison and died the other day after treatment failed. After reporting the death and conducting an examination, his wife could not be located, so the charitable organization provided for his burial.</p>
<h3>Guidelines for Submissions to "The Economic Circle" of the Shen Bao</h3>
<p>To meet the needs of the new era, this newspaper will launch a new section, "The Economic Circle," starting February 16th of this year; the existing commercial news will also be merged into "The Economic Circle," making it a comprehensive economic section. The main purpose is to report, discuss, explore, and promote everything in the economic sphere. We are now soliciting submissions, and the guidelines are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Scope of submissions: All manuscripts related to research and discussion of economic issues, news and statistics on economic markets, whether theoretical or factual, are welcome.</p>
<p>(2) Submission procedures: Contributors should indicate their real name and address at the end of the manuscript and affix their seal. If it is a translation, please enclose the original text.

<p>(3) Submission fees: If the manuscript is published, each character will be paid 50 to 80 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes.</p>
<h3>Do Not Carry More Than Two Dou of Rice Per Household; Failure to Produce a Transport Permit Will Result in Punishment</h3>
<p>The Baojia district authorities of the two concessions, fearing that some residents may not yet be aware of the ban on transporting rice, successively notified all household heads and their families the other day not to transport more than two dou of rice on the streets. Even if it is rice for household consumption, the same rules apply. Residents who wish to transport more than two dou of rice must obtain a transport permit, otherwise they will be subject to punishment.</p>
<h3>Rationing System for Cooking Oil to Be Implemented Within Next Week; Group Sales Method to Be Discontinued</h3>
<p>The Cooking Oil Traders Wholesale Office has been responsible for maintaining the supply of cooking oil for residents of this city, and has always adopted a rationing system for sales. In the early stages, it was able to provide for the needs of residents. However, due to the high demand from buyers, the amount of cooking oil rationed was reduced compared to before, and some oil merchants monopolized and speculated, driving up the price of oil on the black market, resulting in a panic over cooking oil and a shortage of supply. Although the wholesale office improved the cooking oil rationing method by merging the 1,830 cooking oil retail stores in the city and dividing them into Class A and Class B sales outlets, this cooking oil panic has not been resolved. Therefore, the office has been approved by the military allocation bureau to implement a cooking oil rationing system based on population, so that every resident can purchase cooking oil, showing universality and eliminating the manipulative behavior of black market oil merchants. According to reporters' inquiries with the cooking oil wholesale office, the method of selling oil through Class A and Class B cooking oil stores previously implemented will be discontinued. Because current stocks of cooking oil have been sold out, after the subsequent batch of cooking oil is transported to Shanghai, the per capita rationing of oil can be implemented in about a week. The implementation measures for the per capita rationing of oil will be announced in the coming days.</p>

<p>Underwear Company Sympathizes with Scholarship Program</p>
<p>Yesterday, the China Underwear Company wrote, "Your newspaper has been running the scholarship program for four sessions, benefiting the poor and cultivating talent for the country, which is a great act of kindness. Our company, in view of the large number of applicants for this session and the high tuition fees, although the colleagues of the newspaper have made great efforts to appeal, still feel that there is not enough porridge for the monks. We are taking the initiative to send 5,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes to fulfill our humanistic duty and do what little we can. In the future, we will consult with the company's board of directors and colleagues to continue to provide assistance to the best of our ability." In addition, there were also letters from anonymous apprentices and Dr. Ke Jin, expressing their enthusiasm for the scholarship program, for which we are truly grateful.</p>

<h3>Satisfactory Coal Ball Supply Expected to be Maintained: The Committee for Controlled Coal Rationing Annual Report</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Intelligence Department announced that, for the sake of controlling coal rationing, the Council established a Committee for Controlled Coal Rationing, consisting of six members. Two of these seats were requested to be held by representatives from the French Concession Public Works Bureau, in order to seek close cooperation between the authorities of the two concessions. Furthermore, as a result of the efforts of the committee chairman, full understanding was maintained with the Japanese authorities.</p>
<p>Felt Panic Last Spring: Allocated Japanese Merchants' Stored Coal</p>
<p>In the early part of the first half of the year, coal imports completely ceased, and the coal reserves in the two concessions were very weak. As a result of the Council's organization of coal inventory registration, it was discovered that most of the stored coal was held by users. Most of these users purchased coal for emergency use, and very few held a quantity exceeding three months' needs. At the same time, the stock held by coal merchants available for sale was almost exhausted. If users had no stored coal, they felt significant hardship. At that time, all inventory was subject to the regulations of the Council's Announcement No. 564, issued on December 9th of the previous year, which stipulated that a moving permit must be obtained before transportation was allowed. This measure enabled the Council to implement the strictest control over coal distribution.</p>
<p>Because "free coal" (i.e., coal sold on the market) was in short supply, quickly clearing channels and increasing supply was a critical objective. It was learned that the Japanese authorities controlled a considerable daily amount of stored coal in Pudong, and were negotiating for the continued import of new goods. The Committee therefore decided to submit the entire coal problem to the Japanese authorities for consideration, requesting them to release a portion of the Pudong stored coal to meet the urgent needs of the two concessions, and to find ways to clear channels and maintain a normal supply.</p>
<p>The Committee conducted a detailed investigation into the coal needs of the city, and prepared a report for the reference of the Japanese authorities. This report was submitted to the Japanese authorities on January 15th of last year. By the end of January, the Committee Chairman announced that coal had begun to be allocated to the Shanghai Electric Power Company and the Shanghai Waterworks Company. At the same time, a large portion of the coal stored by Japanese merchants had been designated for supply to the two concessions.</p>
<p>Improved Distribution System: Gradually Lowering Prices</p>
<p>In order to control the coal supply, the Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Japanese Coal Importers Association jointly organized a Chinese Coal Merchants Association. Those who joined the association were all giants in the coal industry. Their task was to handle all coal supplies under the direct supervision of the Japanese authorities and in close cooperation with the Council, and to effectively distribute coal according to the stipulated prices. In early March of last year, the first batch of coal was allocated through the aforementioned organizations. Since then, coal has been allocated successively and periodically, and the types of coal allocated have gradually increased. The distribution system has been improved from time to time, while improving quality and gradually lowering prices. The direct allocation of coal to large users has not encountered any obstacles. The coal allocated to these users was in accordance with the stipulated prices and equivalent quantities. However, difficulties were experienced in the allocation of coal to small commercial users and households, because a significant portion of the coal allocated in this way was transferred to brokers, and when it reached the users, it often exceeded the limited price, and the amount did not match the originally allocated amount. The Japanese authorities and the Council, recognizing this, cooperated closely to implement crackdowns and take strong measures, and the situation visibly improved.</p>
<p>Currently, Shanghai's coal reserves are abundant, and arrivals are also strong, sufficient to meet the needs of the two concessions.</p>
<p>Satisfactory Coal Ball Supply: Samples Periodically Tested</p>
<p>Regarding the supply of coal balls, at the end of the year before last, the Hongji coal dust stored by various coal ball factories, used to manufacture high-quality coal balls, was only enough to supply the city's needs for two months. Subsequently, the Committee found ways to sell coal dust stored by some major coal merchants to coal ball factories at reasonable prices, and urged the coal ball factories to continue to fully operate and produce goods in order to avoid a coal ball panic. They also contacted the aforementioned coal allocation organizations to continue to supply coal dust. Retail coal ball stores were ordered to register in order to closely monitor the distribution situation.</p>
<p>Coal balls are a necessity for cooking for Chinese residents, and are the most important of all fuels. The Committee therefore paid special attention to this important commodity. The limited price of coal balls was absolutely not changed, and coal ball users quickly reacted to situations where prices exceeded the limit. At the same time, the Coal Ball Manufacturers Association was able to maintain a high level of cooperation with the Council, so controlling the price and quality of coal balls was easier than controlling coal. There was almost no occurrence of people queuing to buy coal balls in the market, which proves that the allocation of coal balls was indeed satisfactory. The Council then issued Announcement No. 6164 on November 16th of last year, stating that no permit was required to transport coal balls.</p>
<p>The types and quality of raw materials obtained by various coal ball factories are inconsistent, so it is not yet possible to strictly regulate the standard quality of coal balls. However, due to the periodic testing of coal ball samples, the quality of coal balls can be maintained at a fairly good level.</p>

<h3>Cooked Noodle Industry to Obtain Raw Noodles: Must Fulfill Promise to Sell, Cooked for Customers Only, Never Sold Outside the Store</h3>
<p>Regarding the request by noodle shops and stalls to restore flour allocation in order to produce and sell noodles, maintain the livelihoods of workers, and facilitate the purchase of food for the poor and laborers, the Datong News Agency has learned that flour for the cooked noodle industry will be allocated to the raw noodle industry, and then the cooked noodle industry will obtain raw noodles from the raw noodle industry. This can relieve the livelihoods of workers in both industries. However, the amount of flour allocated is too small to be distributed among the industry, and they are still requesting to improve the allocation method. The fried dough sticks and pancake industry and the pancake and steamed bun industry are considering a joint flour allocation and production method due to the same membership scope in both industries, in order to improve the lives of lower-class people.</p>
<p>Cooked Noodle Industry Guarantee</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Material Control Office, in order to prevent the cooked noodle industry from receiving raw noodles from noodle shops and then failing to act in accordance with their promises, has printed a guarantee form to order the cooked noodle industry to fill out and submit. The letter is as follows: "To whom it may concern, due to the convenience of purchasing a large quantity of raw noodles granted to our store by your office, we hereby promise to cook all the raw noodles purchased and sell them to customers, limited to consumption within the store, and to sell them according to the prices set by the authorities. Under no circumstances will they be sold for consumption outside the store. If there is any failure to fulfill the above-mentioned promises, we will allow your office to stop the convenience of supplying a large quantity of raw noodles and revoke the business license."</p>
<p>Fried Dough Sticks and Pancake Industry Petition</p>
<p>The other day, the United Benefit Association of the pancake, noodle, and fried dough sticks industry sent Dai Ziquan and others to the Shanghai Municipal Council to continue their petition. Representative Dai Ziquan guaranteed that the members of the association would abide by the regulations set by the authorities for future operations, crack down on black market phenomena, and submit the proposed price list for pancakes, fried dough sticks, and other goods for review. The price list does not include the profits, electricity, and rent of each business. They requested the authorities to consider the good intentions of each business and increase the original cost by 20% so that each business could make a living. The Pancake and Steamed Bun Industry Association also sent representatives Zhang Guanshou, Tang Miaoquan, Wang Guisheng, and Zhang Jinsheng to the Public Association Section and Material Control Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council to petition for the early restoration of flour allocation in order to maintain the livelihoods of workers and enable the poor to purchase food.</p>

<h3>Leather Shoes: Rubber Soles to be Used Instead: Material Control Office Circular</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Material Control Office, in view of the current shortage of cowhide soles, has issued a circular to the leather shoe industry association in the city, requiring all kinds of leather shoes to use rubber soles instead, in order to reduce costs and keep prices down. The association has notified its member shoe stores to comply. It is said that leather shoes sold on the market will universally adopt rubber soles in the future.</p>

<h3>Inscriptions and Calligraphy (1)</h3>
<p>— Bai Jiao of Yun Jian</p>
<p>Mr. Bai Jiao of Yun Jian is a renowned calligrapher. His orchid paintings and seal carvings are highly praised in his time. This article is a transcript of a speech, making a fair judgment on the debate between inscriptions and calligraphy in the field of calligraphy. Its outline is sufficient to guide future generations.</p>
<p>The debate on inscriptions and calligraphy in calligraphy dates back to the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras. Proponents of inscriptions criticize calligraphy, while those who favor calligraphy attack inscriptions. Broadly speaking, the so-called "Inscription School," from Si Shenbo to Li Meian and Zeng Nongran, with their sawtooth edges and earthworm calligraphy, once swept the scene and dominated the so-called "Calligraphy School." But now, the tide seems to have turned again.</p>
<p>From the perspective of mutual attacks between those who advocate learning inscriptions and those who advocate learning calligraphy, it seems to me to be merely a dispute between worm-eaten peaches and rotten persimmons. I will explain this later. Now, let's first talk about the inscriptions and calligraphy themselves. To discuss inscriptions and calligraphy, we must first understand what is called "inscription" and what is called "calligraphy." What are the definitions and boundaries of inscriptions and calligraphy themselves?</p>
<p>Inscription: Setting up a stone is called an inscription; inscribing words on a stone is called an inscription. The characters on the inscription are directly written on the stone by the calligrapher and then carved. This includes various stone carvings such as commemorative inscriptions, spirit paths, epitaphs, and cliff carvings.</p>
<p>Calligraphy: In ancient times, there was no paper, so writing on silk was called calligraphy. Silk was difficult to preserve for a long time, so ancient calligraphy was copied and carved onto stone or wood, which was also called calligraphy. The writing and carving are indirect. This includes rubbings of letters, memorials, poetry, and so on.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the categories of calligraphy are based on the style of writing: such as seal script, official script, cursive script, running script, and regular script; based on the person: such as Zhong Yao, Wang Xizhi, Ouyang Xun, and Yan Zhenqing; when the calligrapher is not specified, it is based on the dynasty: such as Xia, Shang, Zhou, Qin; based on the state: such as Qi, Lu, Chu, Hao; or based on the object: such as the San Shi Pan, Mao Gong Ding, Qi Hou Lei, Lai Zi Sun Stele, Heng Yue Stele, and Yi Ying Stele. Dividing superiority based on inscriptions and calligraphy, and dividing schools based on north and south, is a new theory in calligraphy.</p>
<p>Originally, the one who stirred up this great wave of "honoring inscriptions and belittling calligraphy" was An Wu Bao Shenbo; following up, promoting and fueling the flames to "honor Wei and despise Tang" was Kang Changsu of Nanhai. Both Bao and Kang were eloquent debaters. Bao wrote the "Art Boat Double Sculls," and Kang wrote the "Expanded Art Boat Double Sculls" (actually, it was only one oar). These two books had a considerable impact on the calligraphy world. However, the one who started this theory was not An Wu, but Yi Zheng Ruan Yuan. And Ruan's innovation was not without the suggestion of Wang Xuzhou's saying "Jiangnan rubbings are not as good as Hebei broken steles." Ruan was an expert in classics during the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras of the Qing Dynasty. He took it upon himself to promote scholarship wherever he went, wrote extensively, and carved books widely. He was also able to write small seal script and Han official script, which were quite impressive. He first had two articles on the North-South calligraphy schools and the North Inscription-South Calligraphy theory (Yanjing Shisan Ji, Volume 1). Scholarship in the Qing Dynasty, especially textual research, was particularly developed. At that time, ancient philology made great progress. Discovering new meanings in the characters of ancient steles, tablets, and bronze inscriptions was valuable enough to correct the classics and history. Ruan was a master of classics and paid attention to calligraphy and painting. He saw that the calligraphy of the time was confined to the Pavilion Calligraphy and the Preface to the Orchid Pavilion, especially since Emperor Qianlong liked to learn Dong Qichang's calligraphy, which was itself vulgar. And the upper echelons followed suit, and the calligraphers who were called masters specialized in elegance and beauty, with no backbone at all. It had really reached a point where it could not be tolerated. Therefore, Ruan, who took it upon himself to correct abuses and raise the spirits, thought of opening the eyes of the world and finding a way out. Thus, his two innovative theories were like giving a strong heart injection to a patient, and prescribing a croton and rhubarb medicine for the patient, causing quack doctors to look at him with new eyes. The essence of the two articles was something of textual research. It can also be said that he was very revolutionary in issuing research-based essays from a historical, geographical, and political perspective. He really had insight, and it was not for nothing. Originally, scholarship is the public property of the world. He promoted inscriptions, but his spirit was entirely a scholar's attitude of establishing a new theory in scholarship. Now, let's excerpt the arguments of the two articles to explore them.</p>
<p>Theory of the North-South Calligraphy Schools: "The transformation from official script to regular script, running script, and cursive script really occurred between the late Han and Wei-Jin dynasties. Later, regular script, running script, and cursive script were further divided into the North and South schools. The Eastern Jin, Song, Qi, Liang, and Chen dynasties were the Southern school; Zhao, Yan, Wei, Qi, Zhou, and Sui were the Northern school. The Southern school, from Zhong Yao, Wei Guan, Wang Xizhi, Wang Xianzhi, Wang Sengqian, etc., to Zhi Yong and Yu Shinan; the Northern school, from Zhong Yao and Wei Guan, An Jing, Cui Yue, Lu Chen, Guo Shi, Shen Fu, Yao Yuanbiao, Zhao Wenshen, Ding Daohu, etc., to Ouyang Xun and Chu Suiliang."</p>
<p>"The Southern school's calligraphy was not very prominent from generation to generation. It was not until the Zhenguan period of the Tang Dynasty that it became popular, but the calligraphy style of Ouyang Xun and Chu Suiliang also originated from the Northern school. Even the 'Kaicheng Stone Classics' written after the Yonghui period of the Tang Dynasty still have the remnants of the Northern school."</p>
<p>"The Southern school is the style of the literati of Jiangzuo, sparse and beautiful, good at letters, and often uses simple strokes. Since what is valued is biased, it has gradually reached the point where it does not recognize the legacy of seal script. In the Eastern Jin Dynasty, there were already many changes. In the subsequent Song and Qi dynasties, the so-called ancient method was completely lost."</p>
<p>"The Northern school is the ancient method of the Central Plains, restrained, ancient, and clumsy, good at monumental inscriptions. The legacy of Cai Yong, Wei Dan, Handan Chun, Wei Jing, Zhang Zhi, Du Du, etc., in seal script, official script, eight-part script, and cursive script, still existed until the late Sui and early Tang dynasties."</p>
<p>"The Northern and Southern schools are as distinct as rivers and lakes that do not mix, and even the aristocratic families do not communicate with each other. This trend still existed in the early Tang Dynasty. Emperor Taizong was originally from the North, but he only loved Wang Xizhi's calligraphy, so he was close to Yu Shinan. Wang Xizhi's calligraphy actually combined the strengths of both the North and South schools, which can be verified in the existing Wang calligraphy. For hundreds of years, the Northern school has been popular, and the common people have also used it a lot. Examining the characters commonly carved on stones and tiles at that time, they all have the calligraphy style of the Northern school in the Qi and Zhou dynasties, and there are very few like the Pavilion Calligraphy or Wang Xizhi's Southern school style. After the Pavilion Calligraphy became popular among the people, there were no more Northern school styles in steles and stone carvings."</p>
<p>"Wang Zhong of the Liang Dynasty was a master of the Southern school. He entered the service of the Northern Dynasty, and Emperor Gaozu of the Tang Dynasty learned his longevity, so his son Emperor Taizong also loved Wang Xizhi's calligraphy."</p>

<h3>Most of the Chinese Stocks Retraced and Fell; Public Utilities Stocks Had a Unique Advantage; Zhabei Water and Electricity Reached 90 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market mostly retraced and fell, which was mainly because the increase was too large in the ten days before the Spring Festival holiday, causing holders to sell for profit. Moreover, the plan for the year lies in spring, and some people sold their stocks to invest in establishing industries. People's hearts were even more uncertain. However, the upward trend of public utilities stocks intensified. Under favorable circumstances, there were many people who bought in anticipation of higher prices. Zhabei Water and Electricity broke through the 90-yuan mark. On that day, it soared from 88 yuan to 93 yuan, and at noon, it was 91.5 yuan, a huge increase of 6.5 yuan. China Electric also followed suit from 63 yuan to 66 or 67 yuan, an increase of 4 yuan. Food stocks were still booming. Merlin Food and Guanshengyuan both soared to a new high of 560 yuan, an increase of 25 to 40 yuan. Among the cultural industries, the Commercial Press sold few shares and was raised to around 660 yuan, an increase of 25 yuan. China and the World both saw a decline, the former to 250 yuan and the latter to 140 yuan. Department stores were the weakest. National Goods Company stepped down from 92.5 yuan to 88 yuan, Xinxin fell from 185 yuan to 72.5 yuan, noon 70 yuan, Yong'an 172 yuan, each down 3 to 5.5 yuan. Underwear (New) was around 23 yuan. Nanyang Tobacco fell below 180 yuan, down a little bit of 2 yuan. Great China Match cut down 10 yuan, approaching the 400 yuan mark. Among new pharmaceuticals, French dropped by 1 yuan, from 33.5 yuan to 2 yuan. Minyi 67.5 yuan, Xin Asia 27 yuan, both had buyers. Xinyi retreated after falling from 300 yuan and immediately returned, still down a little bit of 5 yuan. In the textile industry, Yong'an Yarn Factory stepped down from 440 yuan to 407.5 yuan, noon 415 yuan, down a little bit of 10 yuan. Wuhe Weaving was still around 150 yuan. Small denominations had new buyers, and Xinfeng and Xinfu both printing and dyeing were between 21 and 22 yuan. Guoguang 14 yuan, Yousheng 13.5 yuan. Great China and Hongsheng both weaving also made some progress. Among financial stocks, Zhejiang Xing 1200 yuan and Shanghai Bank 1000 yuan were both buying prices, but trading was not active. The list is as follows:</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Pour Out; Prices of Type A and C Were Side by Side</h3>
<p>The government bond market suddenly tightened yesterday due to tight money supply. Money houses slightly sold off due to head position relationships. Although the market price once rose, it eventually fell. This is also a temporary phenomenon and has little relationship with the bond market itself. However, it is only slightly threatened temporarily. Yesterday, Type C initially traded at 70 yuan and 5 cents. Because the people's sentiment was still strong, it was raised to 73 yuan. Later, as spot goods were sold, it gradually declined, and finally it was 70 yuan, which had not broken into the big barrier. Other types such as Type A initially traded at 69 yuan and 5 cents, rose to 70 yuan and 5 cents, and finally about 70 yuan. Type B initially traded at 68 yuan and 5 cents, rose to 9 yuan and 5 cents, and finally to 9 yuan. Type D initially traded at 7 yuan and 5 cents, rose to 7 yuan and 8 cents, and stepped down to 6 yuan, and finally to 6 yuan 12 cents. Type E initially traded at 8 yuan and 2 cents, rose to 9 yuan and 5 cents, and finally to 8 yuan. The prices were all lower than the previous day, but Type A and C were gradually side by side.</p>

<h3>Central China Cotton Improvement Association Plans to Increase Cotton Production to Achieve Self-Sufficiency</h3>
<p>The Central China Cotton Improvement Association held its fifth board meeting at the Japanese Club at 2 pm on the 9th. The attendees included President Mei, Minister of Industry (represented by You Xiaobiao, Director of the Agricultural Department of the Ministry of Industry), Chairman of the Board Tatsuo Funatsu, Managing Director Takashi Tsutsumi, and more than 20 Chinese and Japanese directors to discuss the budget and business plan for the 32nd year of the Republic of China. First, Minister Mei delivered a speech on behalf of the association, and then Chairman Funatsu reported on the business plan, briefly stating that since the establishment of the association, it has been four years, and with the sincere guidance and assistance of the Chinese and Japanese governments and related parties, the organization has been enriched, the business has been expanded, and the cotton production in Central China has been improved. During the cotton growing season last year, the weather was not very good. The harvest was poor. Moreover, due to the soaring food prices, some cotton fields were converted to food crops, so the area of cotton fields decreased, and the production tended to decline, which is deeply regrettable. However, in the areas guided by the association, the harvest increased due to the cultivation of superior seeds. Currently, due to the improved quality, the selling price is also high, and the income of farmers is higher than before. Therefore, it has made many contributions to the cotton industry economy. In order to meet the needs of the military and civilians in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, it is necessary to increase the cotton production in Central China. The association is adapting to this need, expanding its organization, developing its business, and at the same time, it will work with the Cotton Industry Management Office and other related agencies. If the situation allows, it plans to popularize superior seeds to Yancheng in Jiangbei and other major cotton producing areas, encourage the improvement of cotton cultivation, and also guide wheat cultivation as an incidental measure, so that it can also contribute to the food policy. It is currently striving to increase cotton production, improve the welfare of cotton farmers, and revitalize the countryside. (Ren: Translated from the February 10th Mainland New Daily)</p>
<h3>Japan and China Cooperate to Increase Agricultural Production; The Japanese House of Representatives Budget General Assembly; Prime Minister Tojo Answers Questions from Members</h3>
<p>At the general meeting of the House of Representatives budget on February 2, a member asked about setting the basic policy of the food production zone in Japan, China, and Manchuria. Prime Minister Tojo replied on the spot: The permanent policy of food in Japan, China, and Manchuria is being promoted. It is not necessary to rely on the South. Cooperate with China and Manchuria throughout, and encourage agriculture so that the supply is abundant. The Japanese government is currently guiding the Chinese side to revive Chinese agriculture and stabilize the lives of Chinese farmers. The government is guiding the improvement of the technical level of Chinese farmers.</p>
<p>In order to revive Chinese agriculture, the Japanese government established the North China Industrial Science Research Institute in Qingdao in the 11th year of Showa (1936). It has now been moved to Beijing, with complete equipment and the world's best research institute. It can be called the root of developing Chinese industry, engaging in improving cotton seeds and raising goats. The Japanese government has provided a lot of assistance to it and has great expectations. A large number of agricultural personnel have also been dispatched. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has successively selected Japanese agricultural technicians to go to provide practical guidance. This year, the Ministry of Greater East Asia has proposed an additional budget of 250,000 Japanese yen to assist Chinese agriculture, which has been passed and decided to subsidize the Central China Agricultural Assistance Association. In addition, the National Government and major national policy companies have also provided assistance in various ways, dispatching technical personnel to promote the revitalization of agricultural production in Central and North China.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo also said: In order to achieve Chinese agriculture, the necessary fertilizers are supplied, canals are opened, water conservancy is promoted, and artesian wells are drilled in North China to benefit water sources.</p>
<p>In the past, Chinese agriculture's fertilizers were mainly river mud, so the fertilizer content was insufficient. Fortunately, the Yongli Chemical Industry Company in Nanjing now manufactures ammonium sulfate to make up for this deficiency. The annual output is quite large, and the fertilizer problem in Chinese agriculture has been almost solved. As for other fertilizer issues, farmers are encouraged to manufacture their own, and the results are remarkable. The largest project in developing Chinese industry is the five-year plan for North China Agricultural and Civil Engineering Projects under the General Construction Department. The main purpose is to increase agricultural productivity and achieve self-sufficiency in food in North China; and to promote water conservancy facilities in order to strengthen shipping. The planned water conservancy facilities projects are the Luan River, Ji Canal, Baiyangdian Canal, Shijin Canal, and Dongping Lake. These five areas are mostly paddy fields, so the water demand is very large. The project materials are found locally. As for the start date, the rural leisure period will be used so that farmers can help with the work. There are no obstacles to the five projects since the design.</p>
<p>Artesian wells are being opened everywhere, especially in Shandong Province in North China, which is promoting it more vigorously. It is planned to complete 2.3 million artesian wells from January to mid-May of this year. The China-Japan Cooperative Association and local county authorities are supervising the construction day and night. The project is progressing, and the results may exceed expectations. The Japanese government has allocated 12 million Japanese yen to subsidize its expenses. (Ren: Translated from the February 5th Mainland New Daily)</p>
<h3>Yarn Industry Vows to Eliminate the Black Market</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Yarn Industry Association market originally had news of resuming business the day before yesterday (the 9th), but after the resumption of business, only spot transactions were allowed, and the price limit could not be exceeded. However, because the current prices of various yarns have greatly exceeded the price limit, it is difficult to open market transactions within the price limit, so the resumption of business was postponed. It is learned that the association bureau is still planning for the resumption of the market. Since yesterday, it has ordered all association members to solemnly swear that they will abide by the price limit announced by the authorities for cotton yarn transactions and will never exceed it. The cotton yarn black market can be gradually eliminated. Once the members have sworn, and the cotton yarn price is brought into line, the yarn industry association market can be officially resumed.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth is Sold Off One After Another; The Black Market is Severely Cracking Down; A Fierce Fall in Prices Occurs</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the cloth market was affected by the authorities' severe crackdown on the black market. Holders sold off one after another, so a fierce downward trend occurred in the market with more selling than buying. Fine cloth was 30+ yuan down. Four Gentlemen Plaincloth opened at 13 yuan 2 jiao, fell to 12 yuan 6 jiao, and at noon was 12 yuan 8 jiao, a decrease of 1 yuan 5 jiao. The transaction of colored cloth was still rare. Peach Blossom Lady was sold for 525 yuan.</p>
<h3>It is Not Easy for Firewood and Soap to Rebound; Pharmaceutical Products Also Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Daily necessities are rising steadily, because the debts are more than the sales, and it is not easy to rebound. Phoenix brand matches 4,600 yuan, Beauty brand 4,800 yuan, Golden Tripod brand 3,600 yuan, miscellaneous brand 2,300 yuan, Gubenzao 850 yuan, Scissors soap 820 yuan, Baixiangmao soap 800 yuan, Huangxiangmao soap 750 yuan, the upward trend is still strong. Even the market price of household medicines is also rising, because all parties regard them as good products, causing a rush to buy, resulting in a state of demand exceeding supply in the market. Headache powder 48 yuan, Wan Jin You 62 yuan, Bagua Dan 54 yuan, Partridge vegetables 83 yuan, Dragon Tiger Ren Dan 55 yuan, the rise is very strong.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Can Be Expected to be Freely Traded</h3>
<p>The miscellaneous grain market situation yesterday still only had soybean cake trading. The market continued to tend to rise due to less supply than demand. Kaiyuanlong soybean cake two carts, worth 112 yuan half to 113 yuan, Feizi soybean cake one cart, price 114 yuan, Changji soybean cake five hundred pieces, price 113 yuan, Shenji soybean cake February lower delivery two thousand pieces, price 112 yuan to 115 yuan, and March upper delivery two thousand pieces, price 115 yuan to 114 yuan.</p>

<h3>Reader's Required Understanding</h3>
<p>— Gao Tang</p>
<p>Those who are literate all want to read, but what to read is the question. Some people’s attitude toward reading is: only new and good books are worth reading, even limiting themselves to books on political theory. Therefore, those living in big cities suffer from having too many books, both good and bad, old and new, fearing to read a bad book and thus not knowing what to read. Those living in remote, poor villages suffer from the lack of new books, and the ones available are not worth reading. At school, some feel what they learn cannot be applied, and they only cope with homework, seeking extracurricular books to read—this is one type. Another type specializes in one subject, not reading anything unrelated (as they deem it unrelated). Thus, some doing technical work or engaged in artistic work only read a few books they need, and ignore everything else.</p>
<p>Both of these attitudes have shortcomings. Seeking new and good books to read is correct, because reading is for increasing knowledge, and reading new and good books enables us to learn good and useful knowledge. But old books are not completely devoid of good things. For example, old novels describing the current state of society, such as *Water Margin*, *The Scholars*, *The Bureaucrats*, etc., can enrich our social knowledge. And researching Chinese history inevitably requires using many old historical books as materials. These kinds of books are not only available in big cities, but can also be found in remote, poor villages. But this is not to say that everyone should go and read old books; it's just saying that besides reading new books, old books also have their value. Things are different at school. School textbooks may not all be good, but there are indeed many things that must be learned, such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering, history, geography, accounting, etc. These are all things that can be learned well in school. As for foreign languages, it goes without saying. In culturally backward China, reading materials often cannot satisfy our needs. Therefore, learning a foreign language well means acquiring a powerful tool for reading. Should extracurricular books be read? Of course, they should, but one cannot completely ignore one's schoolwork while reading extracurricular books. Secondly, we should also know that new and good books are not available everywhere, and even if they are available, we may not be able to read whatever we want due to various reasons. Therefore, I believe both new and old books can be read.</p>
<p>Furthermore, specializing in one subject is the right thing to do. Not only that, but we also advocate "learn what you do." Because if I do technical work and cannot do it well or master the technology, I will never be proficient. Engaging in artistic work without understanding art is even worse. But we cannot therefore put up a sign saying "Don't talk about national affairs" and not read other books. No matter what subject we study, we must have a general basic knowledge. Moreover, no matter what we learn, it is to serve society. If we don't understand what kind of society the current society is, even if we shout about service a lot, it's just empty talk. Therefore, in addition to specializing in one subject, we must also study other books.</p>
<p>In this way, I think at least the following books are worth reading: (1) Various progressive theoretical books, (2) Natural sciences, (3) History and geography, (4) Old novels, ancient books. In addition, novels, dramas, music, and various other books that are beneficial to personal improvement, the masses, and cultural cultivation can all be read. And in order to increase reading tools, learning foreign languages is also necessary. But no matter what books one reads or what subjects one studies, one must strive for depth in a certain area. If one reads every book and studies every problem without seeking deep understanding (in fact, one cannot achieve deep understanding in this way), one will become a jack-of-all-trades, master of none. Knowing a little about everything, but not truly understanding anything, is like being skilled in all eighteen martial arts, but proficient in none.</p>
<p>Some people put a lot of effort into reading, even being able to recite the sentences in a book, but they cannot apply them. There are also people who read superficially, skimming through without seeking thorough understanding. After reading, they can only say that they have read such a book, but have not gained anything from it. There are also people who do not distinguish between right and wrong when reading books with completely opposing views, seeking correct opinions. This book is right, that book is also right, and ultimately they don't know who is right, becoming even more confused after reading. There are even people who are satisfied with having a bookshelf full of progressive books, flipping through them when they are happy, and letting insects eat them when they are not. This is not reading, but using books as decorations. In fact, such decorations are not only useless, but sometimes harmful. Reading in this way not only fails to gain useful things from bad books, but also fails to gain useful things from good books. Therefore, studying the method of reading—how to read—becomes necessary.

<h3>Round and Square</h3>
<p>— Ke Wei</p>
<p>Round and square are two different adjectives, one is multi-faceted, the other is round and smooth.</p>
<p>Whenever we talk about someone who is serious and inflexible in doing things, we call him "walking square steps"; for someone who is not subdued by power and wealth, we call his personality "upright." At the same time, for someone who can adapt to the environment on all sides and please everyone, we call him "slick," like a ball that is in equilibrium in physics and can survive in any environment.</p>
<p>On the surface, a slick person seems to always get the advantage. He can adapt to the environment and get praise from all sides. Slickness is indeed a good adjective, but it should be used in moderation, otherwise it will become sycophancy.</p>
<p>An upright person is often cursed as a "stubborn head," but his loyalty, seriousness, and integrity are his virtues. The world's great men and scientists have this spirit of serious work to achieve ultimate success.</p>
<h3>Scenes from the Countryside</h3>
<h3>Self-Respect and Self-Boasting</h3>
<p>— Jie Ren</p>
<p>If a person wants to achieve some success in life, he must have self-respect—respect for his own personality, thoughts, actions, and responsibilities. This is also a mentality that everyone should have.</p>
<p>With self-respect, humanity has new developments, and society can move forward. Conversely, if humanity does not have this kind of self-respecting and competitive spirit, then humanity does not know its own value and its own position, and indeed does not trust its own strength, not believing that its own strength can achieve great undertakings. Therefore, it loses its enterprising spirit and cannot seek the development of life, and society will never have the hope of moving forward. So self-respect is the most reliable capital in life. It is more effective than money, power, and any help from relatives and friends. It can enable people to overcome difficulties and obstacles, and achieve success in their careers.</p>
<p>However, a self-boasting person is not necessarily a self-respecting person, nor does he necessarily have an enterprising spirit. Nowadays, in society, there are self-boasting and arrogant people everywhere. They will describe their family's small assets as vast, and how lavishly they can act in social situations, and how rich their lives are. Many people can be deceived by him, and he can become even more successful. But once the truth is exposed, the result he gets is only everyone's contempt, and he can never be trusted again.</p>
<p>Exaggerating oneself not only fails to make others respect you, but sometimes even if you have very good achievements, the result of self-boasting can make them insignificant. A great person never boasts. Once he boasts, no matter how great he is, he will become small. A self-boasting person is definitely not a self-respecting person. Only those who can respect themselves can be respected by others. Loyal friends! A person without self-respect will never leave deep traces on the road to success. Let us never boast! Let us uphold our self-respect! No matter what kind of undertaking, we will never fail!</p>
<h3>Teacher for All Ages</h3>
<p>— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>(12)</p>
<p>Then he mentioned that he had been at Brookfield for forty-two years, and he was very happy there. "This has been my life," he said simply. "O miki praeteritos refora i i jupiter annos... uh hum—I don't have to—of course—translate it." Much laughter.</p>
<p>I remember many changes at Brookfield. I remember—uh hum—the first bicycle. I remember when there were no gas lamps or electric lights. In our administration department, we always used a person called a lamp-lighter—he did nothing else but wipe, trim, and light all the lamps in the school. I remember that winter term when the ground was a sheet of ice, and it refused to thaw for seven weeks—there were no other games, and the whole school was learning to skate on the swamp. That was probably around 1880. I remember when two-thirds of the school had German measles, and the hall was turned into a hospital ward. I remember our grand fireworks display on Victory Night. It was placed too close to the big awning, and we had to call the fire department to put it out. But the firefighters were also holding their own celebrations, and most of them—uh hum—were also getting into quite an embarrassing state. (Laughter) I remember Mrs. Brool, whose picture still hangs in the snack shop. She worked there until an uncle in Australia left her some money and she stopped. Indeed, I remember a lot, and so I often think I should write a book. What should I call it now? "Memoirs of a Cane and Chalk," how about it? (Cheers and laughter. This was a good joke, everyone thought—one of Chips's best.) Well, well, someday I will write it. But I still like to tell you about it. Really. I remember... I remember... but mainly I remember the faces of each of you. I will never forget them. In my mind, there are thousands of faces—the faces of children. If you come to see me again in a few years—I hope you all do—I will remember those old faces of yours, but perhaps it is very likely that I will not remember—and then one day you will see me somewhere else, and I still won't recognize you, and you will say to yourself, "This old fellow doesn't remember me."

<h3>A Practitioner of Wealth Preservation</h3>
<p>— Qi Ji</p>
<p>Since this newspaper published Mr. Nie Yuntai's method of wealth preservation, it has been widely circulated and recited, touching the hearts of many people. However, it is not yet known how many wealthy people can put it into practice, because it is easy to talk about, but when it comes to practice, there are bound to be difficulties. As the saying goes, knowing is not difficult, but doing is. We don't need to talk about this, and we will see the results in the future. What I want to introduce to readers now is a practitioner of wealth preservation from the Ming Dynasty, whose behavior is worth studying.</p>
<p>In Zhang Dafu's *Meihua Caotang Ji* [Collected Writings from the Plum Blossom Cottage] there is such a record:</p>
<p>"A eunuch from Western Shu [Sichuan] served as an investigating censor. He had five sons, and he set up middle and lower-class properties for each of them, only giving them porridge and gruel. He himself wore and used only what was necessary, never allowing any surplus. When he was old and long-lived, he took out the accumulated emoluments he had saved over his lifetime, which amounted to ten thousand taels of silver, and wished to donate them to supplement the public treasury. The officials reported that the public treasury was not in deficit and that there were no public affairs to which to contribute. The eunuch then requested that he be allowed to dig a hole in an abandoned courtyard and bury the money, inscribing on a stone tablet: 'Returning to the Creator.' After a hundred years, the cellar remained as before. In the *Xin You* year of the *Wanli* reign [1621], the bandit chief created chaos, and public and private property in Chengdu Prefecture was almost completely looted. The scholars and people of Chengdu Prefecture had nothing to eat and were on the verge of collapse. Someone who knew about this matter reported it to the officials, and they were able to avoid complete ruin. This old man's noble righteousness pierces through the ages. Regardless, the eunuchs who served in this land, and the scholars and people of this land, were all honest officials and upright men."</p>
<p>Readers may laugh at this gentleman for being too foolish, and asking why he had to bury the money. My point is that perhaps there were no charitable organizations at that time, and he originally wanted to donate it to the government, but the government did not accept it. At this point, another person might have changed his original intention and still divided the property among his children. Others could not say that he was going back on his word, because there was really nowhere to put the money. But this gentleman regarded this money as if it were poisonous snakes and fierce beasts; no matter what, he would not allow it to remain in the hands of his children, and would rather request to dig a hole in an abandoned courtyard and bury it, rather than bequeath a hundred generations of misfortune to his descendants. When we see this, we can't help but admire his foresight. It is really beyond the reach of ordinary wealthy people. His understanding of the principles of wealth preservation was so thorough that he knew everything about it, not just a little superficial knowledge. Therefore, once he made up his mind, he would never change it. When we read about wealth preservation, we should also carefully consider the truth it tells. If we don't understand it very well after reading it once, we may as well read it several times until we fully understand it, so that when we put it into practice, there will be no hesitation.</p>
<h3>After Reading "Korean Spring"</h3>
<p>— Xiao Shuming</p>
<p>In the long-silent Shanghai literary world, I recently read a literary work that is quite endearing, namely "Korean Spring" by the Korean writer Zhang Hezhu.</p>
<p>There are so many similarities between the Korean and Chinese peoples. Therefore, in Korean literature, we often find our own shadows, and sometimes we find our own character even more. Of course, these shadows and characters are somewhat different in terms of the era, that is, the character of Koreans in this period may be found in the character of Chinese in the previous period, but we cannot deny that in many parts of China today, we can still see the characters of many people in "Korean Spring."</p>
<p>"Korean Spring" is a landscape painting drawn with a painter's brush, and also a recitation poem accompanied by moving music. From the descriptions of the author Zhang Hezhu, we see the flowers and plants of Korea, the people of Korea, the mountains and rivers of Korea, the villages of Korea, and even the architecture of the cities. There are many landscapes and plants that can evoke our emotions, and many lonely people and events that can arouse our sorrow. And the author's method of description, as the translator Fan Quan said in the "Preface," is to use "a fine steel needle to gently prick the skin of people," so its "hidden pain penetrates deep into people's hearts." But the author does not only make people feel "hidden pain," and sometimes uses a passionate tone to speak for the future of Korea. For example, at the end of "Korean Spring," he says, "Although the fields and mountain peaks are coming to spring, it is not known when the spring of humanity will come. Can spring only be in flowers and no longer have a time when 'spring is in humanity'?" At the end of "Beautiful Korea," he says again: "The nature of Korea should be beautiful, and in fact there are many beautiful places. If people can have a prosperous life, then I think it will definitely be even more beautiful." So he finally shouts: "So I eagerly look forward to the early appearance of such a Korea!"</p>
<p>Therefore, for so many years, the translator's criticism of the author is correct: "He gave candor, sincerity, and passion to the readers, and with a burning pen, powerfully implied the future spring of this Korea." (See "Preface")</p>
<p>It is also this candor, sincerity, and passion that makes us—Chinese readers—feel infinitely kind! Reading it, it feels as if the author's words are our own, and we feel that what the author says is what we want to say.</p>
<p>In the long-silent Shanghai literary world, the publication of such a vibrant literary work that makes Chinese readers feel close is a fortunate achievement worth celebrating. So here, I have written this short essay to express my praise for this meaningful work with a little enthusiasm.</p>

<h3>Elementary School Teachers' Medical Aid Fund—Hospital Doctors Start to Sponsor</h3>
<p>The "Elementary School Teachers' Medical Aid Fund" initiated by this newspaper has received enthusiastic responses from all parties. "Those with money contribute money, and those with strength contribute strength." It has gained widespread sympathy from people in society, which is precious and touching! Yesterday, we received a letter from Dr. Song Guobin, former president of the Chinese Medical Association, who generously donated 500 yuan of New Year's entertainment expenses to the medical aid fund, and attached the following simple rules for preferential treatment of elementary school teachers for the diagnosis and treatment of lung diseases: (1) Elementary school teachers must present proof of identity from their school when seeking medical treatment. (2) Registration fees, consultation fees, and cold light test fees are all completely waived. (3) Those who are confirmed to have lung disease after the test can enjoy a 50% discount on cold light treatment fees. (4) Test time: 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM. (5) Address: Dr. Song's clinic at 1193 Route Lafayette.</p>
<p>Preferential Treatment Measures at the Special District Hospital</p>
<p>The Municipal Special District Hospital also responded with a letter. Stipulations for preferential treatment are as per Article 10, and 300 medical treatment certificates are attached, requesting distribution to impoverished teachers in various schools for medical treatment. The preferential treatment measures are as follows: (1) Free diagnosis and treatment of diseases. (2) Free physical examinations. (3) Free vaccinations. (4) Reduced surgical fees. (5) Medicines supplied at cost (also provided free of charge to the poor). (6) Reduced hospitalization fees. (7) Reduced testing fees. (8) Reduced electrotherapy fees. (9) Reduced delivery fees. (10) Obligatory guidance of general health knowledge. The hospital is located at the intersection of 1000 Xiaoshadu Road and Penang Road and is open on Sundays as usual.</p>
<h3>Minsheng Pharmaceutical Factory Donates 1,000 Yuan Worth of Medicine</h3>
<p>Kangjian Dental Clinic at 63 Route Mercier, French Concession, sent a letter stating that from the 10th of this month, from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM, elementary school teachers who bring a certificate for examination will be exempted from the registration fee, and the medical fee will be halved. The Shanghai Chinese Hospital Department Hospital at 32 Huade Road, Tilanqiao, and the branch hospital at 251 Xinzha Road, have also formulated free outpatient and hospitalization measures. In addition, the Shanghai distribution office of Minsheng Pharmaceutical Factory sent a letter generously donating 1,000 yuan worth of medicines. All of these benevolent and righteous acts are truly inspiring.</p>
<h3>Free Schools Directory</h3>
<p>Public Works Bureau Night School: The Public Works Bureau People's Night School at 1461 Xinzha Road recruits young people aged 14 to 20, with a level equivalent to elementary school to junior high school. The tuition fee is 5 yuan per semester, and books and supplies are provided by the school. Classes are held daily from 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM, and the school is scheduled to open on the 13th.</p>
<p>Huinan Elementary School: Thanks to the enthusiastic sponsorship of School Director Wang Shengchang, a special donation of 20 free places and 40 half-fee places, books are provided by themselves. All impoverished and outstanding children are welcome to apply.</p>
<p>Dongguang Elementary School: In addition to the five free places already funded by Mr. Wang Peiyuan, Dongguang Elementary School on Yangshupu Road also has ten half-fee places and five free places. All impoverished and outstanding children can apply.</p>
<p>Gulin Elementary School: The Gulin Elementary School in the Gongyi Workshop on Route Robert, founded by Zhu Shunlu and presided over by Chen Jiping, was originally intended to help out-of-school children in western Shanghai. The fees are extremely low. Now, in order to respond to this newspaper's educational aid efforts, 100 additional free places have been added. In addition to charging only 15 yuan for books and 10 yuan for miscellaneous expenses, all other expenses are waived.</p>
<h3>Amateur Library</h3>
<p>The Chinese Amateur Library on the 7th floor of Pudong Building has a collection of more than 20,000 volumes and more than 2,000 readers. Established three years ago, it has lent more than 150,000 books of various types. Recently, a board of directors was formed, and Zhang Yipeng and Gui Yanfang were elected as chairman and vice-chairman, respectively. Chen Qingshi, Lu Gaoyi, Li Hongshou, and others serve as executive directors, carrying out fundraising, with excellent results. The library's affairs have been greatly refreshed, and there has been an increase in books, newspapers, and magazines. It is now planning to promote a book collection campaign and expand the recruitment of readers. It is said that the procedure for joining the library is very simple. In addition to filling out an application form and paying a deposit of 10 yuan to obtain a reading card, there is only a reading fee of 1 yuan per month. If the family is impoverished and unable to pay the fees, there are still free methods stipulated.</p>
