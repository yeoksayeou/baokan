<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">論政治得失關鍵 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>我們從歷史上觀察歴朝歴代的政治得失，關鍵所擊，半由於領袖的英明，半由於善於用人奧用人得當。但領袖雖英明，而用人不當，則其結果仍未能使政治淸明，國家大治。所以，爲政治領袖者，僅僅有英明之修養，尙嫌不够，必須兼有善於用人之方法，始爲全才。以言大才，原是所在皆有，要在善於器使與善於識拔而巳。</p>
<p>更進血分析歷代政治領袖之事跡，恒有極力求治，而常致於粉亂；勉爲英明，而常致於昏味者，反常之例，不勝枚舉。推原其故，患在不善用人，亦即好疑而自用。大抵政治領袖對於用人，先考試其才具品格，待決定可用以後，必須賦與應有的職權，使之發揮運用。如對屬下之間，衷心稍有懷疑，則不免惑於視聽。視聽旣惑，則忠誠與邪佞遂不易辨別；於是政治上是非顛倒，明暗錯亂。在此塲合，政治領袖環顧左右均可懷疑，旣盡疑其左右，則必孤斷寡決，自用所見。其發於疑惑錯亂之意而自用者，必多失策於忠誠之輩，據理言，爭執不力，難於挽同領袖之意；爭執過力，易於召致領袖之怒，益堅其自用之心。當爭執之時，邪佞之輩，遂得因隙以乘，逢迎領袖之意，柔順獻計，指是爲非，以非爲是，竭力順從領袖所欲言者曲承之。彼時領袖方與忠誠之輩爭勝，乃得順從己意之人，遂忘其邪佞，併丈以拒絕忠言。爲領袖者旣巳至拒忠言信邪佞的地步，天下紛亂，領袖昏昧，自爲必然之勢。但領袖之用心，初非惡忠言而喜邪佞，亦非惡治而好亂，聖明而欲昏，賓患於懷疑而自用，舉屬下爭勝。如爲領袖者能豁然去其懷疑之心，去其自用之意，則奸佞者無所逞其伎倆，而忠言可人，聰明不昧，政事咸得共宜，使天下尊爲英明領袖，萬世仰爲治國領袖。</p>
<p>昔宋仁宗時，宰相陳執中攬權訂政，　諫仁宗不聽，歐陽修奏議力爭，詞嚴義正，共言曰：</p>
<p>「宰臣陳執中，自執政以來，不叶人望，累有過惡，招致人言。而執中遷延，尙玷宰府，陛下憂動恭儉，仁愛寬慈，堯舜之用心也。推陛下之用心，天下宜至於治者久矣。而紀綱日壤，政令日乖，國日益貧，民日益困。流民滿野，濫官滿朝，共亦何爲而致，此由陛下用相不得其人也。陛下不悟宰相非其人，反啓言事者好逐宰相，疑心一生，視聽旣惑，遂成自用之意，以爲宰相當山人主自去，不可因言者而罷之。故宰和雖有大惡顯過，而屈意以容之。…陛下用執中之意益堅，言事者攻之愈切，陛下方思有以取勝言事者，而邪佞之臣，得以因隙而入，必有希合陛下之意者誣言事者欲逐執中而引用他人。陛下方患言事者，上忤聖聰，樂聞斯言之順意，不復察其邪佞而信之，所以拒言事者益峻，用執中益堅。使天下水旱流亡，公私困竭。」</p>
<p>歐陽永叔對於宋仁宗之懷疑自用，忠言逆耳一任邪佞者盤踞要津，誤國誤民，直指懷疑自用，信邪佞拒忠言之不當。如此亢直不屈之態度，無他，迫於愛國之熱情耳！宋仁宗非不知求治，非不學英明，特不善用人，懷疑自用，以致天下紛亂。政治得失，此其關鍵之一。</p>
<p>其次爲善於用人，昔會　潘氏曾論用人之追，有轉移，培養，考察三者，而三者又不可偏廢。當今執政者對於會氏治事法則，頗多採取。而於用人之道，實應再四研摩。就一般政治現象，公務人員辦事之通病，內勤則退縮與瑣屑，外勤則敷衍與類預，習俗相沿，但求苟安無過，不肯振作有爲。如國家一且遭遇艱鉅，遂有乏才應付之患。遽求振作之才，又恐操競者因而倖　。故欲人皆有才，莫若使從事於學術。而各級政治領袖必須以身作則，乃能操轉移風化之本。見無才者勗之以學，以痛懲模稜罷　之習。見脊才者，則愈局之以學，以化其剛愎刻薄之偏。數年以後，人才必大有起色。此即轉移之道。從前國民玫府對於公務　曾訂有進修學術之議，惜未能切實實行。</p>
<p>培養之道，約有數端：如敎誨，甄別，保舉，超擢。上級對於屬員，一言嘉獎，則感而圖功。片語責懲，能畏而改過。此則敎誨不可或綏。榛棘不除，則蕙蘭减色，害馬不去，則騏驥短氣。此爲甄別之重要。人才　之稼禾，上級之敎誨，猶之種植耘籽。甄別爲去其　莠，保舉則猶之灌溉。如再予以超擢，譬如甘雨之降，苗乃勃然以興。如無保舉，如無超擢，則稼禾稂莠同生同落於畎畝之間，殊失培養之意。</p>
<p>古時以詢　考言，爲考察人才之具，二者兼重。歷代政治領袖常有下詔求言之舉。對於時政得失，地方利病，各級官吏，均有陳言之責。此中參互質證，不但從而獲得才具之士，亦可據爲施政參考。且政治爲大衆之建，尤應注意民間輿論。民間與論，有有形者，如報章雜誌等，有無形者，爲人民之所惡所好。有形者易於注視其反映民意之趨向，無形者必須深入民蘭。虛心體察，此考察方法之切要。</p>
<p>綜上所言，自古政治之得失，擊於用人得宜者頗爲重要，而用人之道，重在轉移，培　與考察三者，吾人深覺現代玫治之得失，其關鍵仍擊於比。期待政府參明政合，强化政治地位，乃爲吾人歷久一貫之熱忱，因此，提出政治得失之關鍵，以供當局之重視與參考。</p>

<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日大本營陸軍報道部長谷荻少將今日會見中國駐日記者團，就渝方憲政實施方策談論如次：蔣介石於渝「國民黨」十一中金會，曾說明此次會議目的，乃在確立建國方策。彼謂建國事業應分政洽建設·經濟建設二部，從而推進政治建設之基礎，即在實施意政下云。蔣介石不加凖備，卽出以憲政且體方策者，不問可知其中必含右複維問題。余以爲爲東亞未來之打算，中國實不宜急速成一意政國家，國父孫中山先生固曾以對內實施憲政·對外撒廢不平等條約·爲中國革命之二大事業，但因大東亞戰爭之發展，日本基於實力與道德，實已予中國撤廢不平等條約以莫大協力，且巳成功，所餘之事樂卽買旅憲政。但中國之實施憲政，則常以恢復秩序爲前題，當此中國全國化爲戰塲，四億人民處於流血慘劇中之現狀，所謂實施憲政，實不啻緣木求魚。故我人爲中國革命之成功，爲期待其憲政之實現，尙須要求渝方首先停止抗戰，恢復秩序。美國銀行公會會長黑明哥威曾謂美國國庫之赤字傾向，倘如一選前之悄形而演進·則美國不久將不得不化爲國家社曾主義國獨裁圍。又英國評論家肅伯納亦曾預言此次戰爭之結果，英國將化爲共產主義國，其意乃謂國民毫無所得，而專仰諸於政府給與維持生活時，實即共產社會狀態。美國之畫為獨裁團，集英國之化為共產主義國，均非吾人所願介意者，但對於我親愛之東亞兄弟之中國，在此戰爭結束後，倘能實現憲政，則不勝歡迎。</p>

<p>糧食部長談話原文</p>
<p>『　昔國民政府行政院命令，責成袁履登諸氏，付以組織米糧統制機構之重任，今得幸見米糧統制委員會之成立，殊堪欣慰。惟米糧統制委員會之成就，端賴其下部機構，即地方收買業者之活動如何，因此該會即公佈如別項所記之「米糧收買同業公會籌備委員會設立要綱」，廣徵各地優秀米商共荷艱鉅，克完使命，實爲公明適當之處置。政府對於　選指名之各米商業者，自當不惜予以莫大之援助與保護，至希具右資格同業，依據規定要項，從速申請，俾資貨獻民食問題之解決，是所切盼』。</p>

<p>日大使館當局談話</p>
<p>日大使館當局談話云：糧食問題之解決為大東亞戰爭下中國之緊急問題。國民政府亦積極確立具體方策，目前巳在全國商業統制總會內設立米糧統制委員會，使負收買並配給米糧之責，米糧統制委員會現決由華方米商之中選取最優良之商號担任收買，藉以增進收買能率，盡力解決糧食問題。日方亦因軍事上必要，對於本問題之趨勞極爲翻心。凡爲完成米糧統制委員會任務而需要協力之處，日本軍民白當一致予以促成，日方商號亦視其能力如何，服從米糧統制委員會之統制，從事活躍，以期該委員會之能率得以儘量發揮。希望華方新機構圓滑運用後，民生得以安定，同時對於大東亞戰爭，亦得以完成重要任務。</p>

<p>自從收買棉紗布的一聲　天霹靂而後，上海經濟界的陰霾，始終未能盡散、人人如坐愁城中、雖在農歷中秋以後，銀根戶馳之餘、經濟界的一片疑雲，終於未能散去，遂使六　以來的經濟上海，黯然無興：這樣一片疑雲，本來是可以沒有的，祗因一部份人昧於事理，短於視綫，以為棉紗布一經收買，商人的生路就此斷絕了，以爲棉紗布旣可收買、一切的民間物資也就要朝不保夕了。</p>
<p>如今、由於收買與配給機構的圓滑轉動，紗布不久即將實行配給，食鹽，火柴，肥皂計口援給，亦巳入於具體化，其鵠的所在，無非要使　　者與消費者同無後願之憂；而行政院之令飭廢止「取締上海股票商買賣華商公司股票暫行規則」，尤足以顯示今後之從事於正當工商業投實者，必可獲得政府之提倡　披助。</p>
<p>在廢止『取締華股買賣』之政令下，華商證券交易所巳定於本月二十九日舉行復業典禮了。從此國內工商界益當努力向正當生產之途邁進，以期社會游資，咸趨正軌。關於證劵，我們以前說過，證券的持有，即不啻資本或財產的持有，而關於證券交易，我們也會說過，證券市塲之最大目的，爲使證券交易，趨於正軌，以協助國民經濟之發展與實業之繁樂。所以　投資於華商股票，具廳當提倡的。總之一句話，惟有堅定的經濟理念，方足以解散經濟界的疑雲。證以近日華股市價之奸轉，足見上海經濟界的疑霎漸漸散了。</p>

<p>先前在　貝克會談中，英美淪合作反攻緬甸，曾經提出討論。這未來的反攻。其規模之大，戰鬥之烈，自在意中。阿拉干收將華維爾就任印度總督之後，在印度新般東亞軍司令部，由印度·重慶·緬甸方面美司令官史蒂威爾就任東亞軍司令官，並在印度，錫蘭作根據地，新設東南亞洲司令部，以准行對日軍作戰。凡此種種，均說明在　回緬甸的企圖之下，整備反攻姿態，并在印度從事擴充軍備的內情。茲試檢討興日俱增的日軍兵力，及因國內情勢而失色的敵方，在焦燥和不安中，怎樣在拼命擴充兵力。</p>
<p>中緬國境</p>
<p>先看渝軍的動向，七月中旬，蔣介石不僅頒發新命令，把前所未見的大軍，全面的配置於北軍前綫，目前正在積極移動部隊，且在　　河的某密林地帶，派遣預備軍，企圖在各地新設航空基地，目前正在大事經空中運輪資材，拼命準備。</p>
<p>緬印國境南北</p>
<p>共次，在北部緬印國境方而，跟着雨季的降臨，以前曾退至國境綫後方的英印軍，最近又時見蠢動，企圖向〇　前面進出。此中不僅有從北非戰綫增漲，轉調前來的黑人部隊，且每日在設法增加兵力。</p>
<p>在南部緬印國境，日軍所確保的〇〇對岸〇〇半島的兵力，亦與日俱增。不僅强大的砲兵陣地業巳　築完成，從〇〇通至〇〇的鐵道建設工事，亦　着雨季繼續並行，加以各地的軍用公路，正在一一完成中。</p>
<p>印度境風軍事緊張</p>
<p>返觀印度國內，加幫各答金市巳變成要塞，英美渝軍在市中隨處可見。七月以來的二個月間，從加爾各答到新德里的鐵道，軍　列車不分晝夜行駛着，大量徵集印度兵士，一而並在加爾。答及各地大學新設航空科，培養駕駛員。此外，自北非·西四里戰之後，敵方在印度洋聚集一大艦隊，偵察機連日在國境府近飛翔，把在印空軍在事誇張。想用兵力，兵器之量壓倒對方美國戰略，遠非前次阿恰布奪回之戰可比。英美渝合作同機從海陸空實施激烈反攻，甲巳瞭如觀火，不過無論其規模怎樣大，其數量怎樣多，全軍所蘊藏着的作戰上的脆弱性，則是無可　飾的事實。</p>
<p>即在英美之問，除先前在航空基地間　上　成糾紛外，史蒂威爾的就任東亞軍司令官，亦為美國企圖在印度獲得作戰軍領導性之表現，故英印軍中充滿着反美的空氣。</p>
<p>敵軍雖誇稱其反攻態勢怎樣　備，但我們有着雄糾糾，氣昻昻的，過去在阿拉干作戰中，克服險峻的山岳，阻止進擊的沼澤地，及密林地帶，和數倍於　的敵人交戰，而使之潰不成軍的日本軍隊。我們並有着負起新生緬甸之使命的緬甸獨立軍。在未來的戰鬥中，完全挫折敵軍的反攻，使英美渝軍書到和鄧寇克的悲劇一樣的大敗。（翔：釋自九月十六日西部每日新聞）</p>

<h3 id="c57">虎疫遍華北 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>自從八月底虎疫在北京發現以來，北京的防疫空氣可以說是被了歷代的記錄。不但是各外城的城門都因此關閉着，就連內城通外城的城門也都上了鎖，完全斷絕了交通。城內各地發現虎疫的地方，如王府大街等也都禁止通行。另外則對於防疫注射也加緊進行，當局而且不許沒有七日以前施行注射的人通行各要道，而火車上的乘客沒有注射證也不許登車。</p>
<p>加緊注射</p>
<p>前些日子，通外城的幾個城門都完全關閉，就連電車也不通。只有留下正陽門半開半閉，經過詳細檢查及消毒之後才能放行。一直到本月八日宣武廣安二門才暫時開放，然而通行也極不便</p>
<p>過門時不但須有七日以　的注射證，同時還得當塲噴藥水，把衣服噴得淋淋漓漓才可以在一陣五味俱全的空氣中跟在長蛇陣尾慢慢的過了關門。當局方面而且還派了無數的注射班到處抽選雪白的臂　，狠命的紮，而警察們也就挨戶調查，看看各家的防疫設備和實施是否滿意</p>
<p>捕蠅運動</p>
<p>傳染虎疫的媒介物蒼蠅也遭了「懸賞通緝」的厄運。水日報上登載有新民會市總會決定擴大防疫的計劃，其中就有一項是捕蠅運動兩週間。據說目的在於撲捕重一萬兩的一萬萬頭蒼蠅。各組長辦理捕蠅的還要以領到津　費，每兩賞一元聯鈔，「蠅屍收買費，每組暫定六元，交由該組長保管，隨時發價，俟終了日淸算」。這實在是開了防疫滅蠅風氣的先聲。</p>
<p>投機賣藥</p>

<p>疫勢蔓延</p>
<p>最可注意的，這虎疫似乎有蔓延全華北的勢頭。豐台早就發現虎疫，而且是在北京之前，死的數目巳經好幾百。石門於九月三日也發現有眞性虎列拉。大同口泉方面也於近日發現原因不明的病死者數人，至本月七日才判明眞為眞性虎列拉，就是大同城外也有同樣的病患發生。聽說濟南也被波及，就連張家口也有患虎疫的嫌疑病者。而只九日十日之間北京，也居然還有七個虎疫患者。這樣的蔓延下去，實在是戰時華北的一個櫾大的危機。兩天前北京起了一陣秋風，下了一天大雨，氣候因此也凉快得多。也許上蒼對於這全華北飢餓綫上的居民也起了憐憫之心，就想借此自然的寒力來撲滅這可怕的病菌，而虎疫也有因此而消滅的希望。然而假定虎疫過去，寒風北來，病不死的華北民衆又要如何來抵抗漢北的寒風呢？（九月十五日）</p>

<p>我是一家擁有十三台織機，十餘個工人的小型布廠的經理。自戰爭後，產生了大批的囤虎，把廠中短細的資本，巳被它們漸漸的暗中攫去。因工廠是須要流通的，是不能隨和着它們國積居奇而不動的。蓋製成品終無原料那麼飛躍的快，所以把些些的原料，在明嫌暗蝕的情勢下漸漸的短去，即在平時而言，原料的購置，確實不易，因無力五包十包的蔓批購買，必須經種種的情商，攢管始能獲得、這是現時小本經紀者的隱痛，是無容諱言的，不過，我回到廠中見到終日勞動着的工人，我的精神頓覺稍有安慰，因我們勞資間的感情，是非常的融洽，象是一家人，我在無論如何艱難的情形下，我總不忍使每日幫着我　動的工友門離開我。</p>

<h3 id="e1">On the Key to Political Success and Failure <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>When we observe the political successes and failures of past dynasties throughout history, the key lies half in the wisdom of the leader and half in the ability to employ people effectively. However, even if the leader is wise, if they fail to employ people properly, the result will still be a lack of political clarity and national prosperity. Therefore, for a political leader, merely possessing the cultivation of wisdom is not enough; they must also have the ability to employ people effectively to be considered truly accomplished. Great talents, in fact, exist everywhere; the key is to be adept at utilizing and recognizing them.</p>
<p>Analyzing the actions of past political leaders further, we often find those who strive for good governance but frequently end up causing chaos, and those who try to be wise but often fall into confusion. Such anomalies are too numerous to mention. Tracing the root cause, the problem lies in the inability to employ people effectively, which stems from suspicion and self-reliance. Generally, a political leader should first examine the talents and character of potential appointees. Once they decide someone is suitable, they must grant them the appropriate authority to allow them to perform their duties effectively. If there is even a slight doubt in their heart about their subordinates, they will inevitably be misled by what they see and hear. Once their perception is clouded, it becomes difficult to distinguish between loyalty and treachery. As a result, right and wrong are reversed, and clarity and confusion are intertwined in politics. In this situation, the political leader can become suspicious of everyone around them. Having doubted all those around them, they are bound to make decisions based on their own limited judgment and rely on their own opinions. Their actions, driven by suspicion and confusion, will inevitably lead to misjudgments against loyal individuals. Logically speaking, those who argue weakly will find it difficult to change the leader's mind, while those who argue too strongly risk incurring the leader's anger, further solidifying their self-reliance. During these disputes, treacherous individuals find opportunities to exploit the situation, flattering the leader's ego, offering compliant advice, calling right wrong and wrong right, and eagerly catering to the leader's desires. At a time when the leader is competing with loyal individuals, they find someone who agrees with them, forgetting their treachery and rejecting loyal advice. Once a leader reaches the point of rejecting loyal advice and trusting treacherous individuals, chaos in the realm and the leader's confusion become inevitable. However, the leader's intention is not initially to dislike loyal advice and favor treachery, nor to dislike good governance and prefer chaos, or to be wise and desire confusion. The problem lies in suspicion and self-reliance, and in competing with their subordinates. If the leader can dispel their suspicion and self-reliance, treacherous individuals will have no opportunity to practice their tricks, and loyal advice can be accepted. Intelligence will not be clouded, and political affairs can be handled appropriately. This will lead the people to respect them as a wise leader and future generations to admire them as a leader who governed well.</p>
<p>In the past, during the reign of Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty, the prime minister, Chen Zhizhong, monopolized power and dictated policies. Advisors tried to persuade Emperor Renzong not to listen to him, and Ouyang Xiu presented memorials arguing forcefully with righteous words, stating:</p>
<p>"Prime Minister Chen Zhizhong, since taking office, has not met the people's expectations and has repeatedly committed wrongdoings, inviting criticism. Yet Zhizhong delays in resigning and continues to disgrace the prime minister's office. Your Majesty is diligent, frugal, benevolent, compassionate, and kind – using the heart of Yao and Shun. Judging by Your Majesty's intentions, the realm should have been governed well long ago. However, the order of the court deteriorates daily, the political decrees are increasingly flawed, the country becomes poorer, and the people become more impoverished. Refugees fill the fields, and incompetent officials fill the court. How else could this happen? It is because Your Majesty has appointed the wrong person as prime minister. Your Majesty does not realize that the prime minister is unsuitable but instead believes those who speak out are trying to persecute the prime minister. Once suspicion arises, perception is clouded, leading to self-reliance, believing that the prime minister should resign voluntarily and not be dismissed based on the words of others. Therefore, even though Zhizhong has committed great evils and obvious mistakes, Your Majesty tolerates him... The more Your Majesty's determination to use Zhizhong strengthens, the more fiercely those who speak out attack him. Your Majesty then thinks of ways to prevail over those who speak out, and treacherous ministers seize the opportunity to enter, surely flattering Your Majesty and falsely accusing those who speak out of wanting to remove Zhizhong and promote others. Your Majesty is worried about those who speak out offending the imperial ear, and is delighted to hear words that please Your Majesty, no longer discerning their treachery and trusting them. Therefore, Your Majesty rejects those who speak out more severely and uses Zhizhong more firmly, causing droughts, floods, and widespread starvation, and exhausting public and private resources."</p>
<p>Ouyang Yongshu directly pointed out that Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty's suspicion and self-reliance, his rejection of loyal advice, and his allowing treacherous individuals to occupy important positions misled the country and harmed the people. This upright and unyielding attitude stemmed from a burning passion for the country! Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty was not unaware of the need for good governance, nor did he fail to learn to be wise; he simply failed to employ people effectively, relying on his own judgment, leading to chaos in the realm. This is one of the keys to political success and failure.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is important to be good at employing people. In the past, Zeng Guofan and the Pan family discussed the ways of employing people, emphasizing transformation, cultivation, and observation, none of which should be neglected. Today's administrators have adopted many of Zeng Guofan's principles for managing affairs, but they should study the methods of employing people more thoroughly. Generally speaking, the common failings of civil servants are timidity and triviality among those in internal positions, and perfunctoriness and complacency among those in external positions. Following established customs, they seek only to avoid mistakes and are unwilling to strive for achievement. If the country encounters difficulties, there is a lack of talent to cope with them. Hastily seeking people who can revitalize the situation, there is fear that opportunists will take advantage. Therefore, to ensure everyone has talent, it is better to encourage them to engage in learning. Political leaders at all levels must lead by example to transform customs and morals. Encourage those who lack talent to learn, and severely punish the habit of ambiguity and inaction. For those who have some talent, encourage them to learn even more to temper their stubbornness and harshness. After a few years, there will be a significant improvement in talent. This is the way of transformation. In the past, the Nationalist Government had proposed promoting academic studies for civil servants, but unfortunately, it was not effectively implemented.</p>
<p>The way of cultivation includes several aspects: teaching, selection, commendation, and promotion. A word of praise from a superior can inspire a subordinate to strive for achievement; a word of rebuke can make them fear and correct their mistakes. This shows that teaching cannot be neglected. If thorns and weeds are not removed, orchids will lose their color; if harmful horses are not removed, thoroughbreds will be stifled. This highlights the importance of selection. The talent of individuals is like the growth of crops; the teaching of superiors is like planting and cultivating seeds. Selection is like removing weeds, and commendation is like irrigation. If promotion is added, it is like a timely rain, allowing the seedlings to flourish. Without commendation and promotion, crops and weeds grow and fall together in the fields, negating the purpose of cultivation.</p>
<p>In ancient times, seeking opinions and evaluating merits were tools for observing talent, and both were given equal importance. Throughout history, political leaders have often issued edicts seeking opinions. Officials at all levels have a responsibility to offer suggestions regarding the successes and failures of current policies, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of local conditions. Through mutual consultation and verification, not only can talented individuals be discovered, but their insights can also be used as a reference for policy implementation. Moreover, politics is a matter for the public, and attention should be paid to public opinion. Public opinion has both tangible forms, such as newspapers and magazines, and intangible forms, such as the people's likes and dislikes. Tangible forms are easier to observe to understand the trends reflecting public opinion, while intangible forms require deep investigation into the people. Heartfelt observation is essential for this method of observation.</p>
<p>In summary, the successes and failures of politics since ancient times have largely depended on the proper employment of people. The ways of employing people emphasize transformation, cultivation, and observation. We deeply believe that the key to the successes and failures of modern politics still lies in these aspects. We hope that the government can learn from these principles, strengthen its political position, and continue to demonstrate long-standing enthusiasm. Therefore, we present the key to political success and failure for the authorities to consider and use as a reference.</p>

<p>Chairman's Instructions</p>
<p>(The Chairman's instructions were read on his behalf by Secretary-General Chen). It was briefly stated that the First Police Administration Conference was convened in the 29th year of the Republic (1940). Now, Interior Minister Chen Qun is convening the Second Police Administration Conference before taking up his new post as Governor of Jiangsu Province. This conference is being held after the war has begun, and its significance is even greater. The importance of economic police was then explained, pointing out that the government is not only implementing a controlled economy but also a planned economy, and the execution of the duties of economic police has a significant impact on the people's support for the government's policies. It went on to elaborate on ensuring security, stabilizing people's livelihoods, and the duties that the police should fulfill. Finally, it was hoped that the members attending the conference would work hard to review and improve, and complete the mission of rebuilding China and protecting East Asia. After the speech, the opening ceremony of the conference was completed amidst the resounding military music and photography.</p>

<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) - At the National Police Administration Conference held on the 24th, Chairman Chen Qun delivered the following opening remarks: "The Ministry has submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval the holding of the Second National Police Administration Conference on September 24th of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943). To review the advantages and disadvantages of implementing the resolutions of the First Police Administration Conference in August of the 29th year (1940), to determine what should be maintained and expanded, and what should be changed, is the connection between the Second and First Conferences and should not be ignored. In particular, this conference is being held after the war has begun. The police have a special responsibility to ensure the security of the rear, which should be understood by everyone. Although we are not personally on the front lines wielding weapons against the enemy, all combat power comes entirely from the rear, and the importance of the task we bear is equal to that of the soldiers on the front lines. How to strengthen our strength and improve our efficiency to adapt to the wartime system and achieve victory is what we should discuss and learn from others. This is the motive for convening this conference. We hope that everyone will work hard in their respective positions, express their great ideas, and make contributions to the country and to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 24th (Central News Agency) - The major offensive and defensive battle between German and Soviet forces, centered on the Dnieper River, is becoming increasingly tense, extending from Novomoskovsk, 20 kilometers north of Dnepropetrovsk, to Rozevato, 20 kilometers east. Large German and Soviet forces are concentrated in a narrow battle line of about 30 kilometers, fighting to the death for every inch of ground. Soviet forces are also heavily bombarding the bridgeheads of Chaply and Zaporozhye and the key points of Kiev. Fierce maneuver warfare has unfolded at various points along the 350 li stretch of the Dnieper River's east bank. However, because the German forces are using skillful defensive tactics, they have prevented Soviet forces from achieving their goal of reducing German combat power. In the central battle line, Soviet forces north of Smolensk, after occupying Demidov, are attempting to cut off the railroad between Smolensk and Vitebsk, and have launched fierce attacks. In the western battle line, the two armies have also engaged in heavy tank warfare, with complex battle lines. Soviet forces have advanced to within 10 li of the front of Smolensk.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to German front-line news, German forces have been engaged in fierce street fighting with Soviet forces in the key city of Nevel, 100 kilometers southeast of Smolensk, since the 22nd.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Germany Determined to Fight to the End for Freedom; Goebbels Publishes an Article <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels wrote in this week's issue of "Das Reich" that there will be no surrender in this war. This war is a defensive war forced upon Germany by the enemy, whose intention is to prevent Germany from enjoying all possibilities for national life and development. This war, like any other war, also has countless dangers and risks. A great nation like the German one, if it defends itself with all its might with a strong and clear-sighted government, can overcome all dangers. Goebbels solemnly declared that the success or failure of this war is related to the spiritual solidarity of our people. He listed the obligations that every German must uphold during the war, including silence, discipline, mutual support, and faith. Goebbels said that there is only one thing that the enemy can use to defeat Germany: breaking the people's faith in the government, using their old political tricks, and depriving them of their leaders, thereby depriving them of their defense. Goebbels warned the German people that there is only one thing that must not be lost in this war: freedom. Freedom is the foundation of our life and future. Everything can be replaced, but once freedom is lost, the German people, whether as a nation or as individuals, will lose everything else and all their culture. We are fighting this war not to preserve peace but to restore peace. There is a famous law of war that says "a person must risk what they want to defend." For freedom, nothing is too much to sacrifice. Everything we have was earned for freedom. Without freedom, the German people will lose their purpose and possibility of existence. Free people can regain and rebuild everything they have lost in defending freedom. On the other hand, enslaved people will lose everything and never have a chance to recover. The purpose of our policies and war efforts is to guarantee the possibility for the German people to develop in all aspects as a free nation. Our generation must struggle and work hard to achieve this goal, because the greatest chance of final victory lies in the determination and unity of our people.</p>

<p>Rome, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a Huitong News Agency correspondent in Italy, sources in Rome said that after the Fascist Republican Government was established in Rome on Thursday, the cabinet and government agencies will soon move to northern Italy, and Mussolini himself will accompany them. After the foreign governments formally recognize the Fascist Republican Government, the diplomatic corps stationed in Italy will inevitably follow them to northern Italy. According to diplomatic sources, the Axis powers will take joint action within days to formally recognize the Italian Fascist Republican Government.</p>
<p>Rome, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a Huitong News Agency report, Mussolini's new government is clearly gaining the support of the Italian people. The new cabinet members appointed by Mussolini are all competent and are welcomed by all parties. Defense Minister Graziani is a famous Italian general with outstanding achievements, and he will be able to quickly resolve various military issues. Most of the cabinet members are new faces, and Mussolini seems to want to change things.</p>

<p>Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency telegram) – German News Agency reports: After unsuccessful fierce attacks by British forces northeast of Salerno, the situation on the left flank of the American Fifth Army was relatively calm on Wednesday. However, east of Montecorvino, powerful American troops advanced towards German mountain positions, where intense localized battles erupted. The American attempts to break through the cleverly concealed and deeply entrenched trapezoidal German formations proved ineffective. The American flanking strategy was also hindered by the strength of the German forward positions. It is expected that large-scale military actions will soon take place in all sectors of the front. Over the past few nights, large detachments of enemy troops have landed at the bridgeheads of the Salerno Bay. These troops are likely reserves to fill gaps in the line, or new detachments that will advance north and northeast from Salerno. German reconnaissance aircraft observed significant movements of British and American troops south of Montecorvino and in the Potenza area, indicating that the Allied High Command is planning to send fresh divisions from Taranto or Brindisi to the front to launch an offensive against the Germans. Simultaneously, the number of enemy airfields on the Apulian peninsula is increasing. Initially, only fighter squadrons were present in the area, but it is now claimed that Allied bomber squadrons are also massing there.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Minister Tani Discusses Chongqing's Constitutional Policies <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency telegram) – Major General Tani, head of the Army Press Section of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, met with the Chinese press corps stationed in Japan today and discussed Chongqing's policies for implementing constitutional government, stating the following: Chiang Kai-shek, at the 11th Plenary Session of the Chongqing Kuomintang, explained that the purpose of the meeting was to establish national construction policies. He stated that national construction should be divided into political construction and economic construction, thereby advancing the foundation of political construction, which lies in the implementation of constitutional government. Chiang Kai-shek's unprepared announcement of constitutionalism and related policies undoubtedly contains a complex set of issues. In my opinion, for the sake of East Asia's future, China should not hastily become a constitutional state. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the nation, considered the implementation of constitutional government internally and the abolition of unequal treaties externally as the two major goals of the Chinese revolution. However, due to the development of the Greater East Asia War, Japan, based on its strength and morality, has already provided China with immense assistance and success in abolishing unequal treaties. The only remaining task is constitutional government. However, China's implementation of constitutional government always requires the restoration of order as a prerequisite. In the current situation, where the entire country is a battlefield and four hundred million people are suffering from bloodshed, the so-called implementation of constitutional government is akin to climbing a tree to catch fish. Therefore, for the success of the Chinese revolution and in anticipation of the realization of its constitutional government, we must first demand that Chongqing cease resistance and restore order. Mr. Heminway, President of the American Bankers Association, said that if the American treasury's deficit continues to grow at the current rate, the United States will soon have to become a state socialist dictatorship. Also, the British commentator Shaw predicted that as a result of this war, Britain would become a communist state, meaning that the people would gain nothing and rely solely on government handouts to maintain their lives, which is effectively a communist society. We are not concerned with the United States becoming a dictatorship or Britain becoming a communist state, but we would be very pleased if our beloved East Asian brother, China, could realize constitutional government after the end of this war.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency telegram) – U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox stated in London today, during a conversation with Reuters, that the Pacific war is actually a large-scale naval war against a powerful people who "know every corner of the Pacific well." Knox emphasized that the British public must find a way to understand the vastness of the war currently taking place in the Pacific. The prevailing view in the United States is that Britain considers the European war to be the real war, while the Pacific war is not important. Furthermore, after Hitler is defeated, the United States will be left isolated to fight the Pacific war, as if the Pacific war is solely an American affair. However, he also said that the Allied forces in the Pacific theater are encountering "fierce, reckless, and prepared-to-die combat." British submarines operate in the Atlantic, while American submarines operate in the Pacific.</p>

<h3 id="e26">Announcement of Key Points for the Rice Procurement Association; Discussions between the Minister of Food and the Japanese Authorities <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Yuan Lüden, chairman of the Rice Control Committee, convened a meeting of the executive committee at the office of the Materials Control Review Committee, immediately passing the Key Points for the Preparation of the Rice Procurement Trade Association and promptly mobilizing rice merchants in various regions to commence procurement and purchasing activities. Simultaneously, Minister of Food Gu Baoheng, recognizing that the rice purchasing work, under the framework of the Rice Procurement Trade Association, will generate considerable capabilities, issued a solemn statement yesterday. The original text is as follows.</p>
<p>Original Text of the Minister of Food's Statement</p>
<p>“In the past, the Executive Yuan of the National Government ordered Yuan Lüden and others to undertake the important task of organizing a rice control mechanism. Now, I am fortunate to witness the establishment of the Rice Control Committee, which is truly gratifying. However, the success of the Rice Control Committee depends entirely on the activities of its lower-level organizations, namely the local purchasers. Therefore, the committee promulgated the "Key Points for the Establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Rice Procurement Trade Association," as recorded elsewhere, widely recruiting outstanding rice merchants from various regions to share this arduous task and fulfill their mission. This is a fair and appropriate measure. The government will spare no effort to provide significant assistance and protection to the selected and designated rice merchants. It is earnestly hoped that fellow traders with the necessary qualifications will apply promptly in accordance with the stipulated requirements, so as to contribute to the resolution of the food problem. This is what is earnestly hoped.”</p>
<p>Japanese Military Authorities Express Assistance</p>
<p>The Japanese Expeditionary Force in China also issued a written statement yesterday regarding rice procurement, expressing their determination to assist, stating, “This time, the Rice Control Committee of the National Commercial Control Association has widely selected competent rice merchants from among the general rice merchants in China, ordering them to purchase rice and recognizing those with excellent performance as entrusted merchants of the Rice Control Committee. This measure trusts the original rice merchants in various parts of China, placing Chinese and Japanese merchants on an equal footing, providing them with active opportunities, so that rice procurement can achieve great results, and people's livelihoods can tend to stabilize. All of this is sufficient to demonstrate the sincerity and impartiality of the Rice Control Committee's attitude, which can be said to be highly appropriate. The military authorities fully agree. It is earnestly hoped that the selected rice merchants will deeply feel their great responsibility, exert their intelligence, and fulfill their duties to the nation and the people. The military authorities will provide full support and cooperation for the procurement and transportation of rice by rice merchants with excellent qualities. In case of any persecution or obstruction of their legitimate transportation, resolute measures will be taken.”</p>
<p>Statement by the Japanese Embassy Authorities</p>
<p>The authorities of the Japanese Embassy stated: Solving the food problem is an urgent issue for China under the Greater East Asia War. The National Government is also actively establishing concrete policies. Currently, the Rice Control Committee has been established within the National Commercial Control Association to be responsible for purchasing and distributing rice. The Rice Control Committee has now decided to select the best merchants from among the Chinese rice merchants to take charge of purchasing, thereby improving purchasing efficiency and striving to solve the food problem. The Japanese side is also extremely concerned about the progress of this issue due to military necessity. In order to complete the tasks of the Rice Control Committee, the Japanese military and civilians will unanimously promote it. Japanese merchants will also, according to their capabilities, obey the control of the Rice Control Committee and engage actively, so that the efficiency of the committee can be maximized. It is hoped that after the smooth operation of the new Chinese mechanism, people's livelihoods can be stabilized, and at the same time, important tasks can be completed for the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Yuan Lüden Expresses His Aspirations Yesterday</p>
<p>Yuan Lüden, chairman of the Rice Control Committee, yesterday issued a statement to the Shanghai press regarding the procurement of rice, saying: “I was ordered to organize the Rice Control Committee, and I myself consider my talents to be inadequate for such a heavy responsibility, and I am deeply fearful of failure. Fortunately, the Chinese and Japanese committee members have jointly cooperated and gradually promoted its smooth progress, which is gratifying. In order to achieve the goal of rice control and procurement, the Chinese and Japanese committee members have earnestly discussed and resolved to establish the "Key Points for the Preparatory Committee of the Rice Procurement Trade Association" in various rice-producing areas. The main points have been summarized, and a good reputation has been established. This plan will be promoted smoothly with the assistance of the authorities of friendly nations. In addition to sending a special envoy overnight to present it to the Executive Yuan for approval, it will also be promulgated today.”</p>

<p>September 20th is the fourth Aviation Memorial Day of the friendly nation Japan. In order to reduce the strength of the British and Americans and strive for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War, Japanese residents in various places have spontaneously launched a fundraising campaign to donate aircraft. It is learned that the Chongming Island Japanese Merchant Distribution Cooperative Fuli Foreign Firm, Yurong Trading Company, Meicheng Foreign Firm, Wanli Foreign Firm, Qinshan Company, Japanese Trading Company, Jiangnan Foreign Firm, and others have jointly donated 100,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes for the purchase of aircraft.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Flour and Wheat Professional Committee Seizes Smuggled Flour; Confiscation to be Carried Out if Found Again <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Since the National Commercial Control Association's Flour and Wheat Professional Committee implemented flour allocation in the main areas of the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui and the two special municipalities, the results have been good. Because the association's purchase of wheat this year is very sufficient, the quantity of flour produced by Chinese and Japanese flour mills allocated to various places has been increasing daily. The heavy burden of supplementing people's food has greatly benefited. Furthermore, because the association is concerned about the needs of the people and preventing illegal manipulation for profit, it plans to crack down on acts that disrupt the unified allocation. Recently, it has strictly investigated reported incidents of flour smuggling. Recently, a large amount of smuggled flour was seized in Nanxiang Town on the Beijing-Shanghai railway line and purchased at the allocated market price. In order to maintain the control policy and consider the normal and legal development of merchants' operations, the association has decided to severely punish smuggled flour in the future and has already notified various branch offices and relevant military and police agencies that if smuggled flour is found again in the future, in addition to confiscating the smuggled flour free of charge, it will also be severely punished.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Cotton Purchasing Price to be Determined Soon <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>As late autumn approaches, the cotton in Jiangsu and Zhejiang is about to be harvested. Therefore, the Cotton Professional Committee is preparing a concrete purchasing plan in order to prepare for the unified purchase of new cotton and is determining the purchasing price of new cotton this year based on the prices of rice and other agricultural products. A reporter from the Commercial News Agency recently learned from cotton merchants that the price of cotton in the first half of this year soared due to the soaring market price of yarn and cloth. Various textile factories sent personnel to various nearby locations to purchase as much as possible, so the price of cotton suddenly soared, once breaking through 5,000 yuan per dan. However, since the government authorities implemented the purchase of yarn and cloth, the market price of yarn and cloth plummeted. Seeing that there was no profit to be made and that there was a risk of losses, various textile factories stopped purchasing one after another. In addition, the tight credit situation made general hoarders uneasy and sought to sell off their goods. As a result, in a situation where demand exceeded supply, the price of cotton fell in a straight line. Until recently, the price per dan has fallen back to half, and transactions are still rarely opened. However, it is faintly heard that the cotton price to be determined by the Cotton Professional Committee in the future will be slightly higher than the current market price in order to protect the interests of farmers.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Shortage of Coal Briquette Retail Should Be Corrected Urgently <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Recently, there has been a shortage of coal briquettes in the spot market in this city. Retail stores are limiting sales at the door, which is causing inconvenience to citizens. This is because rumors of coal briquette price increases are rampant, leading to opportunistic manipulation, resulting in a sudden reduction in supply at retail outlets. However, the authorities have already made precise calculations regarding the cost of coal briquettes, and manufacturers and retailers can obtain legitimate profits. Therefore, the fixed price of 32 and a half yuan per load can be maintained as usual. However, the current state of supply needs to be corrected by the authorities to benefit the people's livelihood.</p>

<p>Economic Circles - First Review</p>
<h3 id="e48">The Clouds are Gradually Dissipating <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Since the thunderbolt of the cotton yarn purchase, the gloom in Shanghai's economic circles has not completely dissipated. Everyone is sitting in a city of worry. Although after the Mid-Autumn Festival in the lunar calendar, the economic uncertainty after the loose credit has not disappeared. This has made Shanghai's economy since June bleak and uninteresting. This cloud of doubt could have been avoided. It's just that some people are ignorant of the facts and short-sighted, thinking that once cotton yarn is purchased, the merchants' livelihood will be cut off. They think that since cotton yarn can be purchased, all private materials will be in danger.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to the smooth operation of the purchasing and allocation mechanism, yarn and cloth will soon be allocated. Salt, matches, and soap will also be distributed according to population, which has been put into concrete form. The purpose is to eliminate any worries for both suppliers and consumers. The Executive Yuan's order to abolish the "Provisional Rules for Prohibiting Shanghai Stockbrokers from Trading Stocks of Chinese Companies" is sufficient to show that those engaged in legitimate industry and commerce in the future will surely receive the government's support and assistance.</p>
<p>With the abolition of the decree "Prohibiting the Trading of Chinese Stocks," the Chinese Stock Exchange is scheduled to hold a reopening ceremony on the 29th of this month. From now on, domestic industrial and commercial circles should work harder to move towards legitimate production, so that social idle funds can be put on the right track. Regarding securities, we have said before that holding securities is equivalent to holding capital or property. Regarding securities trading, we have also said that the biggest purpose of the securities market is to make securities trading on the right track, to help the development of the national economy and the prosperity of industry. Therefore, investing in Chinese stocks should be encouraged. In a word, only a firm economic concept can dispel the clouds of doubt in the economic circles. The recent sharp rise in Chinese stock prices shows that the doubts in Shanghai's economic circles are gradually dissipating.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Stock Exchange Reopening Approaching: Reviewing Stocks, Application Registration Deadline on the 29th <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Stock Exchange has been preparing for more than two months and is now largely ready. Some brokers, after being reviewed by the Ministry of Industry, have been announced, and the candidates for various positions in the exchange have also been decided. Now that the reopening is approaching, in order to comply with the current regulations, various stocks must first pass the review before they can be listed for trading. Therefore, all companies that want their stocks to be listed must immediately go to the exchange's preparatory office to complete the application registration procedures for review and approval. This registration will be closed on the 29th, and late applications will not be accepted.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Brown Sugar Needed by Postpartum Women: Can Apply for Purchase <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Beware of Being Deceived by Sugar</p>
<p>Brown sugar is commonly used by women, especially postpartum women. However, the sale of brown sugar has disappeared in the market recently, and prices have soared. The Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office has stopped allocation for a long time, resulting in urgent market needs. Therefore, some unscrupulous merchants believe that it is profitable, so they dye white sugar and sell it as brown sugar. This type of fake sugar has already been sold around Wuma Road. I hope citizens will not be deceived. According to people in the sugar industry, the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office has some brown sugar in its warehouse, but the quantity is very small. Postpartum women can apply for purchase from the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office with a doctor's certificate. It is said that the sugar price is calculated according to the special price allocation, and each person can purchase up to one or two pounds.</p>

<p>Application Deadline at the End of the Month</p>
<p>Yesterday, an official from the Welfare Section of the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the First District Public Office told a Datong News Agency reporter that the authorities' general registration of factories in District One will be closed by the end of this month. Those who fail to register by the deadline will be fined 20 yuan per week. In the past week, more than 400 factories have submitted applications, bringing the total number of registered factories to 700. It is also understood that the authorities are carrying out this registration to understand the situation of each factory and to ensure its safety and maintain hygienic conditions.</p>
<p>Oil and Grain Circulation Increasing, Market Reopening Undecided</p>
<p>Recently, the free circulation of oil and grain has been increasing, and goods from various places have been arriving enthusiastically. In order to smooth supply and demand and stabilize market prices, oil and grain merchants in this city recently jointly requested the authorities of the industry association to open the miscellaneous grain and oil cake market on Edward Road. According to the responsible party of the association, this matter must be approved by the relevant authorities and is currently difficult to decide.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Chinese Stock Trends <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Chinese stocks are mostly bullish. After a big rise, there is a small amount of scattered profit-taking. However, investors are still constantly absorbing large amounts. Idle funds are returning to the right track, and there is still a feeling that demand exceeds supply. Among the textile industry, Wing On Textile is rising alone and will not return. It is heard that shareholders will increase capital on the 27th of this month, changing the par value of 100 yuan to 10 yuan and giving each old share 20 new shares. Therefore, the buying interest is the most enthusiastic. According to reliable sources, China Film will distribute dividends in the middle of next month and give half a new share for each old share, which is enough to stimulate people's hearts. Most stocks have risen again, and trading is very active. The industry stocks are listed below.</p>
<p>Textile: Wing On Textile opened high in the morning and, with favorable news, had the highest buying interest. It once soared to only one level away from the major mark and then showed a roundabout shape, eventually rising one level higher than the previous day. Shinwa and China Textile each rose sharply after breaking through the mark. Dasheng No. 1 and No. 3 factories and Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving had limited increases. Guangqin Textile did high, and Qingfeng and Rongmeng were flat. Meiya and small par value Hongsheng and Dachina and other weaving stocks were all hovering flat. Meilun Woolen buying interest suddenly increased, rising to outside the premium level, with buyers. Jingfu Socks was firm, Jinglun was stable, and trading was brisk.</p>
<p>Department Stores: Wing On Company once created a new high price after the second capital increase in the morning, and there was scattered profit-taking, but the major holders searched for large quantities, and the market price fell and rose several times, eventually closing flat compared with the previous day. Sincere also once broke through the mark and then returned, eventually rising slightly with National Goods and Lane Crawford Company. China Underwear was flat.</p>
<p>New Medicines: New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory once rose half a mark, and then stabilized, eventually rising significantly. China-France retreated after breaking through the major mark, and the rise was less. New Star Pharmaceutical Factory and Five Continents Pharmacy are still rising gradually. China-West was stable, and China and Star Perfume fell slightly.</p>
<p>Finance: Continental, Shanghai, Zhejiang and Hui, Jin Cheng, Salt Industry National China and China Trust are still rising gradually and will not return, seeing new high prices again.</p>
<p>Culture: The most stable. Commercial Press and China Book Bureau were flat. World Book Bureau was supported by organized buyers and rose significantly alone. Yongxiang Printing was still flat.</p>
<p>Real Estate: The fluctuations were very slight. Yongxing rose slightly. New Benefit and Lianhua were flat.</p>
<p>Public Utilities: Zhabei Water and Electricity actually rose two levels. China Electric Power was also firm in the buying trend. Public Electrical Machinery and Xiang Sheng Tricycle still had few changes.</p>
<p>Industry: Jiuan Industrial continued the rising trend of the previous day, rising significantly after breaking through the mark. Dachina rose to half of its par value. Xinghua also shouted high. New Asia Construction Trading was booming outside of the multiples of its par value and continued to rise. China and National China Investment were also stable and firm. Dachina Match Trading was quite active inside and outside the mark and rose slightly. Nanyang Tobacco jumped two levels, and Huacheng was stable.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous: Standard MSG is still being raised directly by powerful people. Merlin Food was slightly weak. After Kangyuan Cans opened the rights shares, the bid was more active. China Coal Mine, Hanyang Iron and Steel, and Zhenhua Paint all fell. Baoshan Glass and Standard Paper were slightly firm. China Film rose to 45% above par value, and trading was quite active. Other stocks were stable and trading was sparse.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Business Summary <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Public Bonds: Yesterday, the market turned weak again. People's hearts were not as excited as before. The supply was always greater than the demand. The general focus has turned to the stock market. Type C bonds were lower than the previous day, but actually rose midway. The final price at noon was slightly lower than the previous day. Other types A, B, D, and E bonds fell slightly and were still balanced.</p>
<p>Interbank Rate: The interbank rate of the Money Industry Association was unchanged at 18%.</p>
<p>Grains: Rice and grains were well-supplied due to the increasing number of people freely transporting them, and prices fell again. Due to the large arrival and weak sales of oil and grains, the market showed a trend of wanting to rise but being unable to do so.</p>
<p>Medicinal Materials: Guang goods suddenly rose sharply due to the place of origin. The Cantonese help stopped going out and instead came in, and the price rose gradually. However, Sichuan goods and Tianjin goods were still less asked for. Huai goods and Zhejiang goods were even more depressed.</p>
<p>Wool: 70-80% of wool goods, regardless of coarse or fine, smooth or thick, were still falling. Observing the standard market situation, the situation is getting worse and worse. There are more sellers than buyers in the market. Although the prices of all kinds of goods have fallen within the limit price, the general public has shifted its focus and mostly still wants to wait and see. Therefore, except for the stores that have reduced prices, there is a slight business, but the original box and whole package business is still rare.</p>
<p>Rayon: The market turned slightly stable. Green goods were once shouted high mainly because the financial situation was upward, but they finally failed to rise due to sluggish sales.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Enemy Countries Counterattack Burma: Japanese Army Waits for Opportunity to Intercept <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The joint counterattack against Burma by Britain and the United States, which was previously discussed in the Beck talks, has been proposed for discussion. The scale and intensity of this future counterattack are naturally expected. After Alagan's collection of General Wavell to take office as Governor-General of India, Stilwell, the US commander in the East Asia Military Headquarters in New India, served as the commander of the East Asia Military, and based on India and Ceylon, a new Southeast Asian Command was established to conduct operations against the Japanese army. All of these illustrate the preparations for a counterattack under the intention of returning to Burma, and the internal situation of expanding military preparations in India. Now, let's examine the increasingly large Japanese military strength and the enemy, whose strength has been diminished by the domestic situation, in anxiety and unease, how they are desperately expanding their military strength.</p>
<p>China-Burma Border</p>
<p>First, look at the movements of the Chongqing army. In mid-July, Chiang Kai-shek not only issued a new order to deploy an unprecedented large army to the front lines of the northern army, but is also actively moving troops and dispatching reserve troops to a secret forest area of the ... River, attempting to establish new air bases in various places. Currently, they are transporting materials by air and desperately preparing.</p>
<p>North and South Burma-India Border</p>
<p>Secondly, on the northern Burma-India border, following the arrival of the rainy season, the British and Indian troops, who had previously retreated to the rear of the border line, have recently been seen moving again, attempting to advance to the front of 〇. Not only are there black troops who have been increased from the North African front and transferred here, but they are also trying to increase their military strength every day.</p>
<p>On the southern Burma-India border, the strength of the Japanese army secured on the opposite shore of 〇〇 on the 〇〇 peninsula is also increasing daily. Not only has a strong artillery position been completed, but the railway construction work from 〇〇 to 〇〇 is also continuing in parallel during the rainy season, and military roads in various places are being completed one by one.</p>
<p>Military Tension in India</p>
<p>Looking back at India, Kolkata and other cities have become fortresses, and British, American, and Chongqing troops can be seen everywhere in the city. In the two months since July, military trains have been running day and night on the railway from Calcutta to New Delhi, and large numbers of Indian soldiers have been recruited and new aviation departments have been established at universities in Calcutta and other places to train pilots. In addition, since the North Africa and Sicily battles, the enemy has gathered a large fleet in the Indian Ocean, and reconnaissance planes have been flying near the border government for days, exaggerating the amount of air force in India. The US strategy of overpowering the other side with the amount of troops and weapons is far from comparable to the previous Battle of Akyab. The British, American, and Chongqing cooperation and coordination will implement a fierce counterattack from the sea, land, and air, which is already as clear as fire. However, no matter how large its scale or how large its quantity, the operational vulnerability inherent in the entire army is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>Even between Britain and the United States, in addition to the previous disputes over equipment and coordination at the air bases, Stilwell's assumption of the post of commander of the East Asia Military is also a manifestation of the United States' attempt to gain leadership of the operations in India. Therefore, the British and Indian armies are full of anti-American sentiment.</p>
<p>Although the enemy boasts about how prepared its counterattack posture is, we have the majestic and high-spirited Japanese army that has overcome steep mountains, prevented attacking swamps, and densely forested areas in the past battles in Alagan, and fought with enemies several times its size, causing them to collapse into disarray. We also have the Burmese Independence Army, which bears the mission of a new Burma. In the future battles, we will completely frustrate the enemy's counterattack and make the British, American, and Chongqing armies suffer a major defeat similar to the tragedy of Dunkirk. (From: Western Daily News, September 16)</p>
<p>Beijing Communication</p>
<h3 id="e57">Widespread Cholera Epidemic in North China <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Since the discovery of cholera in Beijing at the end of August, Beijing's epidemic prevention measures can be said to have broken all previous records. Not only were the gates of all the outer city closed, but even the gates of the inner city leading to the outer city were locked, completely cutting off traffic. Areas within the city where cholera was discovered, such as Wangfujing Street, were also closed to traffic. In addition, vaccination efforts were stepped up. The authorities did not allow anyone who had not been vaccinated within the past seven days to pass through major roads, and passengers on trains without vaccination certificates were not allowed to board.</p>
<p>Stepped-Up Vaccinations</p>
<p>A few days ago, several city gates leading to the outer city were completely closed, and even trams were not running. Only Zhengyangmen was left half-open, and passage was only allowed after detailed inspection and disinfection. It was not until the 8th of this month that Xuanwu and Guang'an Gates were temporarily opened, but passage was still extremely inconvenient.</p>
<p>Not only was a vaccination certificate valid for at least seven days required to pass through the gate, but disinfectant was also sprayed on the spot, drenching clothes before one could slowly pass through the gate in a long line amidst an air full of mixed odors. The authorities also dispatched countless vaccination teams to randomly select pale arms and stab them vigorously, while the police went door-to-door to investigate whether each household's epidemic prevention equipment and implementation were satisfactory.</p>
<p>Fly-Catching Campaign</p>
<p>Flies, the carriers of cholera, also suffered the misfortune of being "wanted with a reward." The *Shui Ribao* newspaper published the New People's Association City General Association's decision to expand the epidemic prevention plan, one of which was a two-week fly-catching campaign. It is said that the goal was to catch one hundred million flies, weighing one *wan* *liang*. The group leaders handling the fly-catching would also receive a subsidy; each *liang* of flies caught would be rewarded with one yuan of Kuomintang currency. "The fly carcass purchasing fee is provisionally set at six yuan per group, to be kept by the group leader, with prices issued at any time, and liquidated at the end." This truly set a precedent for epidemic prevention and fly eradication.</p>
<p>Speculation in Medicine</p>
<p>During this period, there were also many people engaged in speculative trading. The first and most obvious were advertisements for "assured cures," which, according to reports, had the effect of "living and dying together." "Epidemic prevention vaccination" advertising signs were also hung high at the entrances and on the walls of various candle hospitals. Even traditional Chinese medicine practitioners had become vaccination experts. In Xidan, one traditional Chinese medicine practitioner boldly wrote "Vaccination against cholera, three yuan" and other words in front of his door. In order to prevent malpractices, the authorities decided to ban them and ordered all private hospitals and clinics to provide free vaccinations, with medicines distributed by the Epidemic Prevention Headquarters. However, there were still many who defied the ban.</p>
<p>Spreading Epidemic</p>
<p>Most worryingly, the cholera epidemic seems to be spreading throughout North China. Cholera was discovered in Fengtai earlier than in Beijing, and the number of deaths had already reached several hundred. On September 3rd, true cholera was also discovered in Shijiazhuang. In the Datong Kouquan area, several people who died of unexplained causes were also discovered recently. It was not until the 7th of this month that it was confirmed to be true cholera, and the same disease also occurred outside Datong City. It is said that Jinan has also been affected, and even Zhangjiakou has suspected cholera patients. In just the two days of the 9th and 10th, there were still seven cholera patients in Beijing. Such a spread is truly a huge crisis for North China during the war. Two days ago, Beijing experienced a bout of autumn wind and a day of heavy rain, and the climate became much cooler as a result. Perhaps Heaven has taken pity on the people of North China who are on the brink of starvation and wants to use this natural cold to kill the terrible germs, so there is hope that the cholera epidemic will be eradicated. However, assuming that the cholera epidemic passes, and the cold winds come from the north, how will the people of North China, who have not died from the disease, resist the cold winds from the north?

<h3 id="e58">A Small Textile Manager's Plea <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Shicong</p>
<p>I am the manager of a small cloth factory with thirteen looms and a dozen workers. Since the war, a large number of hoarders have emerged, and the short, fine capital of the factory has been gradually and secretly seized by them. Because factories need circulation and cannot follow their hoarding practices and remain immobile. After all, the speed at which finished products can be created are not as quick as the speed at which raw materials rise, so raw materials gradually get shorter and shorter in the situation of overt hatred and covert depletion. Even in normal times, the purchase of raw materials is indeed not easy, because we lack the ability to buy in bulk of five or ten packages, and must go through various requests and accumulation to obtain them. This is the hidden pain of small-scale traders at the moment, and there is no need to shy away from it. However, when I return to the factory and see the workers who are working hard all day long, my spirit feels slightly comforted, because the relationship between labor and capital is very harmonious, like a family. No matter how difficult the situation is, I always can't bear to let the workers who help me work every day leave me.</p>
<p>Starting in late July, movement permits were impossible to obtain, and the raw materials in the factory gradually became insufficient. Then came the government's order on August 9th to implement a comprehensive purchase of yarn and cloth. In this extremely helpless situation, I had to announce that the ten thousand yuan of cash I had prepared was gradually being used up. I fear how the days to come will be arranged. Where is the floating capital of my own? It is yarn and cloth, but it has been purchased by the government, and it is impossible to exchange it for cash. To ask relatives and friends for loans! They have almost the same fate as me. If it is delayed for a long time without a proper relief method, then I can only be forced to take one path: to dismantle and sell the machines and dismiss my workers who have been with me for more than ten years. I think there are more than one person in society in my situation. I hope the wise authorities will consider it.</p>
<h3 id="e59">An Appeal for Cotton Textile Workers <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— Zhigao</p>
<p>I am a glove weaver in a certain glove factory. Since I joined the glove factory last year, business has been quite smooth. Unfortunately, now I have been harmed by hoarders who have raised yarn prices privately. Between June and July, the high yarn prices were the most severe, rising directly from 20,000 to 40,000 yuan per piece, causing the prices of various cotton textiles (socks, gloves, towels, undershirts, etc.) to rise accordingly. This kind of phenomenon is truly illegal. The authorities have repeatedly issued price limits, but no one has followed them. Therefore, this time the National Government had no choice but to resort to this drastic measure, first prohibiting movement, and then implementing registration and purchase, so that unscrupulous merchants could no longer raise prices, like "rats eating their way into a rat trap." They can only await their death. Therefore, the prices of various cotton textiles have also been falling sharply in recent days.</p>
<p>However, this move has had a huge impact on cotton textile factories and workers. Even if you have existing yarn and have registered it, you can no longer use it to produce. So, wouldn't all the large and small cotton textile factories and workers in Shanghai have to stop working? Can all the cotton textile workers in Shanghai find jobs in other industries at once? I urge the authorities to actively conduct investigations and implement a rationing system as soon as possible, so that our cotton textile workers can suffer less pain and be able to continue working to make a living. That would be fortunate indeed.</p>

<h3 id="e60">The Importance of Public Health <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Jishan</p>
<p>In densely populated areas, opening factories that harm public health has long been strictly prohibited in all civilized countries. They must be set up at a distance from the city, so as not to cause interference. Recently, when I visited a friend at the southern end of Route Ghisi, I suddenly felt a foul odor that made me want to vomit. According to my friend, there is a paint factory at the southern end of that road, between Route Foch and Route de Zikawei. Because the equipment is not complete, a kind of chemical and paint odor is scattered and dispersed during work, affecting the neighborhood. After breathing this kind of foul air, many neighbors suffer from headaches, eye irritation, nausea, and coughing. The students of Zhenying Primary School in the north are particularly affected, so it is not only annoying.</p>
<p>I heard that during the French Concession era, the neighbors jointly requested the French Concession health authorities to order improvements. It has been closed for more than a year, and the surrounding residents were able to breathe cleaner air. Unexpectedly, the factory reopened at the beginning of the month, releasing foul odors, causing the surrounding residents to panic and feel uneasy. The factory should strive to improve or relocate to take care of public health.</p>
<p>Recruitment of Service Personnel: Ten service personnel are being recruited by the organization. Food and lodging are provided, and a monthly subsidy of 300 yuan is given. Applicants must have a secondary school education, be between 20 and 35 years old, be able to endure hardship, have no bad habits, and be of sound character. Please personally write a resume, attach a 2.5-inch half-length photo, and send it to the Second Middle School of Zhoupu Town District, Pudong. If qualified, a written notice will be sent for an interview in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Claim for Lost Watch: While taking a trolley bus home the other morning, I found a watch in my pocket. I was quite surprised and wondered where it came from. Please come to Mr. Zheng at Hongsheng Pawnshop on Route Muling between 12:00 and 2:00 every day within a week to claim it. After the deadline, it will be used as a *Shen Bao* scholarship.</p>
