<h3 id="c1">東亞解放與團結 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 山鹿素行</p>
<p>革命家的話，往往有燃燒起人們心原上的熊熊野火者。本月二十日來華訪問的革命家，自由印度臨時政府主席鮑斯氏，用無綫電向中國呼籲的播音，以及宣言中，充滿着非死裏逃生過幾次的革命家，所不能流露的熱情，與浩然正氣，於是使我內心感動，佩服，五體投地。其中，打動我的心弦者，會是下列三點：</p>
<p>在實現亞洲各國人民的解放與團結之路程上，呈現着兩種困難，一即支配與分化亞洲各民族的西歐帝國主義之存在，二即能給亞洲弱小民族以援助的亞洲力量之缺如。</p>
<p>但，能　復興亞洲的主導作用之唯一力量者，只有日本。這個日本，當與西歐帝國主義列强公然絕交前，是未能給與弱小國家以援助的。然而，一力四一年十二月，終於對亞洲的絕好機會降臨了。……自此以後，革命浪潮撼動了整個日本。就是說，新的自我覺悟，浸透了日本國民的靈魂；今日的日本，早已不是五年前的日本了。……</p>
<p>日本在今天，業巳準備好，按正義平等，獨立自主，互惠互助的原則，以盡力建設東亞的新秩序。同時，這也正是所有亞洲民族應盡的養務。這些原則，歸根結底就是實現亞洲解放與團結的唯一基礎……</p>
<p>假如解放不伴隨着團結，那末被解放了的國民，將曇花一現，再度受帝國主義國家的蹂躪，這種危險不能說沒有。……亞洲各國人民，爭取解放與團結必須同時並進。……為了完成亞洲的解放與團結，則首先必須邁進，第一中國統一與第二印度自由的段。</p>
<p>把印度以及近東人民，推向爭取自由運動的浪潮，或相反而使之醉生夢死者，關鍵全操在中國民衆的手掌裏。同時，假如中國民衆喜歡的話，則中國的統一，可能在二十四小時內實現。我向　君潑問：「究竟誰在妨得着中國的統一？……」中國諸君！一刻也不要猶豫，仔細反省，然後下決心吧！</p>
<p>此次來華訪問，關於特別的感觸，略述一二，即目前的中國，正苦惱於兩個極大困難裹。一即中國本身的分裂為二，二即中日兩國仍處在戰爭狀態裏。……日本締結了中日同盟，條約中約定，全面和平實現，則完全撤兵。……道以前，曾經　壞中國的主　與獨立的那　種種特殊情形，當然，要一律取消。因此，現在中日兩國，為什麽必須火拚肉搏？這此使我惶惶然不解其所以。……</p>
<p>——！這是如何思想高超，熱情而率直的話呵！在心平氣和，滔滔不斷的演說中，流露出來披肝瀝肌的純情與萬馬奔騰的渴望；在大聲急呼中，感覺到革命巨風所捲起的滔天浪潮。（轉人第四版）</p>
<h3 id="c2">棉花統制委員會昨舉行成立大會　行政院長代表出席致訓詞 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　棉花統制委員牽合　組，經主任委員　關亭召集中日雙方委員首次籌備委員會議，確定棉花統買統配實施綱要，及組織暫行章程草案後，即於昨日下午四時，在外灘華　飯店八樓舉行成立會。出席中日委員及各機關長官來　代表等一百餘人，首由主席委員聞閑亭報告，致開會詞後，即請行政院代表實衆部長陳君　，田尻公使，商統會理事長唐痛民，物資總制審議會代表陳光中致訓詞，華中棉產改進會理事長李祖虞致詞，最後由聞主任委員致答謂後，即茶點散會，茲將各情分　如下：</p>
<p>出席委員長官來賓</p>
<p>主任委員聞蘭事，副主任委員童侶育·菱田逸次，委員江上達·聶潞生·陳葆初·郭順·童潤夫·勝田　·堤孝·友永藤三郞·野田洋一·田中期次耶，棉花收買同業協會理事郭　活、沈燕謀、劉靖基、馮飭生、調　雄、監事黃首民、三好靜一郎等。並到有各機關團體長官曁來賓，行政院代表實業部長陳君　，陳市長代表市經濟局長徐天深，財政部駐滬辦事處處長李徵，物資統制審議委員陳光中，商統會理事長唐　民、秘書農張佩申、張恩　、沈雷春、羅納　，米統會主任委員袁履登，華中綿產改進會李祖虜。日方長官有日本大使館田尻公使，及中日實業界來實丁方源，許冠羣、吳昆生、兒玉長次耶，山田六合夫田中茂光等。</p>
<p>主任委員致開會詞</p>
<p>棉統會主任委員聞蘭事致開會詞云：「此次政府設立棉花統制委員會，以蘭亭等承乏主任委員，副主任委員及委員之職，　事等自維才力棉薄，本不敢　此重任，惟念現值大東亞戰爭之際·棉花為重要物資，統制之良否，不獨攸關民生，於整個東亞共榮　之經濟，尤有莫大之關係，用是不　　陋，勉　棉薄。所幸棉花統制業務方面，尚有前棉業專業委員會，及華中棉花統制會之成規，在另一方面，敵會上受各關係當局之指導，下能本業諸同人之協力，使閘亭等獲得努力之標準，與興趣，尚祈此後多多賜敎，俾免隕越。」</p>
<p>汪院長詞目的有二</p>
<p>行政院汪院長代表德部長致訊詞云：「今日棉花統制委員會成立，本人代表汪院長來滬參加，感到非常榮幸，查國府戰時經濟政策之推進，當在施行物資統制，物資統制目的有二：　棉花之增加生產，可以協力大東亞戰事。　棉花之增加生產，可以裕國利民，棉花一項，是中國主要農產品之一又為工業原料上重要物資之一，由此可知關係民生之重大，更可知棉花統制委員會所負之使命尤為重大。商統會之綿花統制委員會，以中日雙方棉業界重要份子結成，推行統制H作，達成增產希望，此方為棉花統制委員會之重大使命完成」。</p>
<p>田尻公使希望增產</p>
<p>田尻公使詞云：今日棉花統制委員會成立，承蒙招待，至為感幸，在華中物資方面，當以棉花與食米為重要。這次棉花統會任務，無論在中國或日水方面觀察，俱可謂為保滿足時局之要求，故今後工作及成績，自以增產一項，尤佔重要。在棉統會立塲來講，本年度收實棉花成績甚佳，預計今後收買成績必更佳。本人希望棉統會此後應注意如何增加生產，明顯的說，增產關係收買至大，收貝棉花，所貸予之資金，更宜注意，確係貨予棉花生產之眞正農民，本人對棉花係外行，根本不能有良好貢獻，所幸棉統會全體係棉書界專家，至希注意共重要之點」。</p>
<p>唐壽民氏發抒五點</p>
<p>略云：於棉花一項，物資之重要，無論軍需·民生方面，均有密切之關繫，頃隊部長與田房公使巳購述無遺，無煩　言，值茲盛會，姑就希望各端，略抒鄙意：一·收花工作，首重定價，價略之訂定，必求合理。二·訂定合理價格，即為收集充　棉花之基本，本年收量，希望達到預期之成數。三·除收果大量棉花而外·尤望願全來年生產，促其增進·四·收買資金，為農民應獲之代價，務求　滴歸農，為其再生產之資本。五·農民對於官方計劃，容有不明，希望予以開導，俾使上下一心，澈底諒解，如老秤新秤等分別，在習慣上之不同等，總　農民對官方苦心，予以聽議。棉統會爲商統會之外園　　，正副主任委員及諸委員中，又有一部分爲商統會之理監事，在商統會方面，除當力予支援之外，用敢略述其希望，並祝棉統會之完滿成功。</p>
<p>陳光中詞發展棉農</p>
<p>物資統制審議委員會代表陳光中致詞，中心在收棉工作，務使棉農能平衡發展，完成棉花統買統配目的，最後由華中棉產改進會理事長李祖眞，代表來賀致詞，希望棉統會成立後，對於收買棉花價值之議定，要顧到農民生活，以期達到增加生產的目的云云。</p>

<p>— 猛獅</p>
<p>滑稽的消息</p>
<p>盎格魯·山姆大叔的首都—華盛頓，又傳來萬分滑稽的消息了。在我們以為是滑稽的，在讀者諸君想來，一定也是可笑的吧！那消息是這樣：據華盛頓的無綫電廣據，九月二十四日，瑪麗蘭州代表參議員泰定斯將承認菲列濱即刻完全獨立的決議，付參院討論。大家知道參院議員泰定斯是主張菲列濱獨立，並起草菲列濱獨立法的一個。讀者當還記得，該獨立法規定，以實施後第十年的一九四六年七月四日為期，賦與菲列濱完全獨立。茲據數日前所傳，泰定斯付參院討論的決議，修正該法，即日賦與菲列濱獨立，不必等到一九四六年。</p>
<p>上面是傳來的最近美國企圖欺騙一千六百萬菲列濱民衆，並全體政界的消息。這消息實足令人噴飯。蓋參院議員，除泰定斯外，恐怕誰也知道，且不能不知道，美國早就沒有賦與菲列濱獨立的意思。美國在菲列濱的勢力，自去年五月菲島的美軍投降日軍以後，即巳完全消滅。然而美國還有無聊的人們，說什麼從菲列濱撒回美國的主權咧！以菲列濱比之自由國民的一家族，與以平等的地位咧—還繼續作這種無用的空論。</p>
<p>然而美國對菲列濱的這種可笑的態度，另有用意。他們保證泰定斯氏的決識，盎格魯。山姆大叔將繼續努力從事解放菲列濱。讀者對此究作何感想呢？沒有比這保證史滑稽的了。何以呢？因為第一，菲列濱民衆從美國支配下解放，已歷一年餘了。第二，在上次六月第八十二屆日本議會上，東條首相業巳聲明，菲列濱民衆所希望的獨立，不須一年二年，在本年即將實施。束條首相的演說稱：</p>
<p>日本的態度</p>
<p>「我們對菲列濱獨立的態度，已屢經闡釋。現在我們更進一步聲明本年中將以獨立的光榮賦與菲列濱喝過樣，在狡猾的美國支配下，多年來辛辛苦苦地追求獨立的幻夢之菲列濱民衆，自此次戰爭發生以來不到二年，即將逐漸完成其宿望。」</p>
<p>試把日本的遭對菲列實政策，和美國的比較。盎格　·山姆大叔九年前在法令書上記下了所謂菲列賓獨立法，約定十年後容許其獨立</p>
<p>然而通過這獨立法的一九三四年，菲列賓的知識階級，誰也在自問：獨立為什麼不即日賦與呢？何以不能不再等十年呢？當然，我們很明白拒絕菲列賓即日獨立的理由。那理由有二：第一，美國帝國主義者不頤喪失菲列賓民衆的支配權；第二，美國本國內的菲列賓獨立支持者們和友人，對菲列賓的獨立問題，完全缺乏誠意和正義的觀念。可是現在菲列賓獨立的舞台執事巳經沒有他的工作了。新非列賓共和國的國會議員巳經選出，他們用非常的熱忱，決心再建本國，使菲列賓在大東亞共榮圈的迅速完成上，擔任光榮的任務而有所貢獻。他們孜孜矻矻的眞摯的努力，在最近的將來，必將結實，這是我們可以探信無疑的。</p>
<p>急變的事實</p>
<p>頑固地拒絕諒解並承認在東亞的發生的急變的現實之美國人，理在至少不能不承認下面的事實：第一，合衆國現在完全和菲列賓隔絕了，第二，菲列賓民衆業巳獲得完全獨立。那巳是千眞萬確的事實了。九月三十日，菲列賓的三位指導者，訪問東京，即菲列賓獨立準備委員長大總統候補者洛勒爾博士，菲列賓行政委員長伐爾伽斯氏，菲列賓國會候補議長阿基諾氏三位，均為在運營新國家的手腕上富有自信的人，在這種英邁的政治家指導下，新菲列賓共和國的人民，巳脫離四十年以上的美國的區迫，享受他們所僮憬的生活的權利，自由，幸福。</p>
<p>面臨這種現實，尙且用武力向全東亞民族之建設共榮團的共同企業挑戰，反軸心方面戰爭煽動者之罪，不能不說是不可容赦的大罪。如其他們眞的尊重自己所聲明的，欲開拓自已運命的其他民族及其他國民的權利，則他們沒有干涉東亞事態的理由。大東亞民族祗希望沒有干涉來妨害他們，祇要求自行開拓救濟自己的道路。</p>

<h3 id="c35">美取銷排華律　廣田課長談話　斥美虛偽政策 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>中央社訊　日本駐華大使館發言人廣田氏，昨夜對中央社發表謂：美上議院通過取消排華律之法案，每年特准華人一百零五名移八美國，此種法案，並不能對平等待遇東亞人民之基本問題獲得解決，因英美及中南美各國，早巳對束亞人民實行排擠，倘美國政府自信能以取消排華徉之手段，而消滅歷年來對華人及東亞人民之岐視，即足以使美人對東亞人民向抱種族上輕蔑之心理者．一掃而空，則屬滑稽之至。</p>
<p>美國戰時權宜措施</p>
<p>倘重慶方面相信華人將能受到社會上及政治上之平等待遇，則此種忘想。更覺可笑。廣田氏認提議排華律之取消，乃係美國戰時之權宜措施，以阻止重慶之脫離反軸心陣營。英美及其自治領，以及中南笑各國等，一向拒絕東亞人民進境，而印度人乃英國之公民。亦不准自由通過英國領土。廣田情報部長繼稱：東亞十萬萬人之心理，對此種問題之淸楚答復，即可具見於最近東京舉行之大東亞會議所宣佈之共同宣言第五款規定，即「東亞民族將　力於清除全世界上之種族差別」，排斥東亞遊民之法律，不獨適用於華人，且適用於東方十萬萬人民，不獨美國一國如此，而且英國及中南美之國家，亦無不如此。</p>
<p>眞正動機綏靖重慶</p>
<p>廣田情報課長繼稱：謂准許東亞人民進入彼等國家，乃係不重要之事實，而其根本上乃在准許移民以後，在社會上及政治上之生活。以平等待遇東亞人民之問題，使有典型之美國神經者·認為每年特準一百零五名之華人移美，即爲對華人之平等待遇，撤銷排華律之法案，係昨年向議會提出，雖於美國之傳統强烈之種族偏見之反對中，卒被上議院通過，此種表示美政府之用心，係渴望綏靖重慶政權，而此戴有假面具之「美國高尙行為」其眞正之動機，可於美國海軍大將楊尼爾前淤議院之委員會討論該法案席上之言論，有所表示，其以為倘不加以有效之援助，則重慶政府之崩潰可能性，實極嚴重。而贊成撤銷排華律之通過者，亦常年稱：謂於戰爭時期中華人之移八美國實不可能，且美政府將不願予華籍移民以平等待遇，而主張於戰後重行考慮此項問題、易言之、即美政府並無改善華人待過之誠意，其唯一之用心，乃在綏靖重慶，而避免其脫離反軸心陣營而巳。</p>
<p>以往華工奴隸生活</p>
<p>考華人移民美國之歷史、即當同溯至美國內之黃金狂之時期，華人赴美，均以奴隸之地位，以補充美國中西兩部份之鐵路工人，及礦工之缺乏。在洛基山之鐵路建築營中，及在惠安明及　泰納之礦區中華人苦工死於奴隸之生活甚多。廣田氏指出謂：倘重慶相信以每年一百零五名之移民，即可抵償前此移民之生命，彼等即無權利作華人領袖之資格，因華人均以恢復中國為職志，歷史上之事實，中國人民之移入美國者，係受奴隸之待遇。在一八七一年，美在寗波召募大量華工，而許以優原之報酬，常船甫離中國領海時，華工所居之船艙，即遭封鎖，且無事物供給，當船抵達橫濱時，華工股法派遣代表兩名，向日本當局請求救濟，日政府當即予以干涉，于審判中，認該船乃爲一奴隸之船舶，而所有船上之華工，遂獲得自由。該船之目的地雖為祕魯，而共他同樣性質之船隻開赴美國乾甚多本，則受騙為奴之中國遊民，均獲自由矣。在結論中，廣田情報課長再申述謂：根本之問題‵不在少數華人之准入美國，而其要點，乃在平等待遇，倘重慶不能窺透美人之綏靖政策，又不能以華人之立塲而把握其眞意，則重慶將成東亞之叛徒矣。</p>

<p>在華中華北接壤地帶。特殊狀態下設置的蘇淮地區，由於今次通貨的調整，可使表明中央化而由是推進國府自强工作。此項劃時期的政策，巳定下月一日起實施，對於中日經濟界，均多影響。綜合一般意向，都認為應作全面的贊助，因為此項舉措，不但使中儲券流通區域擴大，更含有政治的意味，就是從此可以促成政治經濟的一體化，並由於此項施策的推進，將使華北華中間的金融匯兌，物資交流，種種根本問題，漸次獲得合理的解決，進而使中國經濟統一，踏上自主發展的軌道。</p>
<p>查蘇淮地區，是在民國三十一年二月指定為桔別行政區域，歸國府統轄的，但在經濟方面，則由華北政務委員會統轄下之　銀券流通使用，以迄今日，因此行政與經濟，分成兩個領城；在施策上，不無發生矛盾窒碍之處。今次決心加以調整，至少可使華中華北間之經濟連繫加强，儲備券的信用增大，中央儲備銀行的基礎强化，這些都是可以預期的效果。不過在實施方面所態注意的，為不必採取急劇的方式，否則兩種幣制恐將　起競爭，面於收買工作，交易運營上，發生阻害，故必須採用漸進主義，逐步改變。關於此點，在國府周財長的談話中，亦已有過　重聲明了。</p>
<p>關於匯兌交易計劃，我們認爲在範園以內，亦應予以自由，使兩地域問之物資，得以圓滑推進，即如淮申匯兌之正式承認，公開許可，亦為值得考慮之問題。以往華北民族資本，一向依存華中而發展，現在中國財政界熱望雙方能夠相互交流，相互發展，即華中華南之民族資本交流，亦須使之密接開展：循此以進，才可期望中國民族資本統一之完成。（節譯十一月二十六日大陸新報）</p>

<h3 id="c41">星期評論　（自第版轉來） <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>演詞中的含意，不待贅宮，也許早巳明瞭。但把他的內容，扼要地總結起來。即　亞洲百年來的宿望，就是驅逐西歐帝國主義，而取得解放，然而這一點，業已在大東亞戰爭下的今天，藉日本武力解決了。　同時，今天的日本，早已不是五年前的日本，現在已經成為屹然聳立的全部大東亞的指導者了；不僅撤消了阻撓中國建設的不平等條約，且在中日同盟條約內諾言，中日全面和平實現，即行撤兵。　旣如是，中日兩國究竟為什麽肉搏和火拚？這就是惶惶然無法能使我明白的地方。　中國民衆如願意，可在二十四小時內，實現中國統一。　中國諸君！為什麽還在躊躇不前？一分一秒也不要錯過，起來吧！下決心吧！—大意就是如此。</p>
<p>這正是亞洲現買的一篇絕好寫照！同時，我們應當玩味者，　亞洲的解放與團結，必須同時取得，假設解放不伴隨若團結，則被解放了的國民，不久還會有被英美帝國主義犧牲的危險，這樣警告後，又大加强調說，為使求得眞正解放，必須與解放同時，完成東亞的大同團結；　如想完成亞洲的解放與團結，則首先必須邁進第一中國的統一，第二印度的自由道樣階段；為了印度的解放，從而也為了東亞的解放與團結，則中國的統一，即解決中日問題的中國統一實現，就是先決條件。</p>
<p>使中國分裂和衝突，造成兩個國家，以副帝國主義的陰謀企圖，樹立永久的榨取對象，這樣的英美不是敵人麽？自認為是「同等和協助的時代」，以親愛，友情，尊敬，衷心獻與友邦中國，意圖使中國永久存在於世界，這樣的日本不是夥伴麽？這是一目瞭然，用不着詞費的。</p>
<p>我想對中國的友人說幾句話。即必須認淸，現代並非是征服和榨取的時代，業巳改變為同等和協助的時代，更必須認識，自從日本近衛聲明以後的一連串對華政策，全是根據這個同等與協助時代的認識，同時，對於在世界規模上實現道一點的使命與責任，放到中日兩國的友情聯糸上，期待大東亞共榮圈的確立，基於這種自我覺悟，而始終一貫地，不可搖動的信念與理智，是在不斷的生長與發展。假如把這種日本對華政策，解作侵略，認為帝國主義的形式，那正如指馬為鹿是一樣的錯誤。如因形式相同，而就認為實質也相同，那就不免被入議為不能洞查歷史的飛躍，與歷史深底裏流動的思想之變化的愚人。我相信，救東亞者，與其說是中日甲午戰役與日俄虞役時，日本的大勝，倒勿寗說是站在中國立塲上看的二十一條，和滿洲事變，這才是創造今日保衛東亞的根深蒂固的良好基礎。假如沒有當年的二十一條，則無滿洲事變，如無滿洲事變，那末今日東亞的天下，究竟將成什麽樣子呢？</p>
<p>我們為了保衛東亞和大同團結，則必須把過去外圍語所寫成的五十年中日外交史，重新改寫。心情與理想完全都不同的日本和英美，雖然表面上都是所謂帝國主義，但實際上是同型異質，似是而非的東西。滿洲事變以後的日本對華政策，只要在這條歷史的眞理鏡上一照，就可以正確瞭解其眞實意義，鮑斯話中的哲理，如從這方面來證實，才能義加光輝而燦爛。</p>
<p>我向中日兩國人民呼籲，過去五十年用歐美語寫成的中日外交史，重新改寫吧！然後認淸東亞的現實，恢復中日本然的姿態吧！這樣才能完成東亞的解放，這樣才能一箭雙雕地同時取得鮑斯氏所說的解放與團結，這樣才鞥你建設東亞長期宿願的大同，大東亞新秩序。（季譯）</p>

<h3 id="e1">East Asian Liberation and Unity <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Yamaga Sokō</p>
<p>The words of revolutionaries often ignite a raging wildfire in people's hearts. The revolutionary, Mr. Bose, President of the Provisional Government of Free India, who came to China for a visit on the 20th of this month, delivered a radio broadcast to China via wireless, and in his declaration, there was a passion and righteous spirit that could only be expressed by a revolutionary who had escaped death several times. This moved me deeply, and I admired him wholeheartedly. Among them, what touched my heartstrings the most would be the following three points:</p>
<p>On the path to realizing the liberation and unity of the peoples of Asian countries, there are two kinds of difficulties: one is the existence of Western European imperialism, which dominates and divides the various ethnic groups of Asia; and the other is the lack of Asian power that can provide assistance to the weak nations of Asia.</p>
<p>However, the only force that can revive Asia is Japan. Before Japan openly broke off relations with the Western European imperialist powers, it was unable to provide assistance to weak countries. However, on December 1941, an excellent opportunity finally arrived for Asia. ... From then on, the revolutionary wave shook the entire Japan. That is to say, a new self-awareness permeated the souls of the Japanese people; today's Japan is no longer the Japan of five years ago. ...</p>
<p>Today, Japan is ready to do its best to build a new order in East Asia based on the principles of justice, equality, independence, autonomy, mutual benefit and mutual assistance. At the same time, this is also the duty that all Asian nations should fulfill. These principles are, in the final analysis, the only basis for realizing Asian liberation and unity...</p>
<p>If liberation is not accompanied by unity, then the liberated people will be like a flash in the pan, and will once again be ravaged by imperialist countries. This danger cannot be said to be non-existent. ... The peoples of all Asian countries must strive for liberation and unity at the same time. ... In order to complete the liberation and unity of Asia, it is first necessary to take the steps of first, Chinese unity, and second, Indian freedom.</p>
<p>Whether to push the people of India and the Near East into the tide of the struggle for freedom, or, on the contrary, to make them live in a dreamlike state, the key is entirely in the hands of the Chinese people. At the same time, if the Chinese people are willing, the unification of China can be realized within twenty-four hours. I ask you: "Who is preventing the unification of China?..." Chinese friends! Do not hesitate for a moment, reflect carefully, and then make a decision!</p>
<p>Regarding my special feelings about this visit to China, I would like to briefly mention one or two things, namely that the current China is suffering from two major difficulties. One is that China itself is divided into two, and the other is that China and Japan are still at war. ... Japan has concluded a Sino-Japanese alliance, and the treaty stipulates that complete peace will be realized and troops will be completely withdrawn. ... Before that, all the special circumstances that damaged China's sovereignty and independence will, of course, be cancelled. Therefore, why must China and Japan fight each other now? This makes me puzzled and unable to understand why...</p>
<p>—! What highly insightful, passionate, and straightforward words! In his calm and continuous speech, he revealed a pure heart and a burning desire; in his loud and urgent calls, one could feel the滔天 wave rolled up by the revolutionary hurricane. (Continued on page four)</p>

<p>Chairman Delivers Opening Speech</p>
<p>Wen Lantong, Chairman of the Cotton Control Committee, said in his opening speech: "The government has established the Cotton Control Committee, and Lantong and others have been appointed as chairman, vice chairman, and committee members. I feel that my talent is limited, and I dare not accept this important task. However, considering that we are in the midst of the Greater East Asia War, cotton is an important material. The quality of control is not only related to people's livelihood, but also to the economy of the entire Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, I will do my best. Fortunately, in terms of cotton control, there are still the established rules of the former Cotton Industry Professional Committee and the Huazhong Cotton Control Committee. On the one hand, I will receive guidance from the relevant authorities, and on the other hand, I will be able to obtain the cooperation of my colleagues in the industry, so that I can have standards and interests to work towards. I hope to receive more guidance in the future so that I can avoid making mistakes."</p>
<p>Premier Wang's Speech Has Two Objectives</p>
<p>Minister Chen, representing Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, said in his speech: "Today, the Cotton Control Committee is established, and I feel very honored to come to Shanghai to participate on behalf of Premier Wang. The promotion of the wartime economic policy of the National Government should be based on the implementation of material control. There are two objectives of material control: 1. Increasing the production of cotton can help the Greater East Asia War. 2. Increasing the production of cotton can benefit the country and the people. Cotton is one of China's main agricultural products and an important material for industrial raw materials. From this, we can see the importance of people's livelihood, and even more so, the important mission of the Cotton Control Committee. The Business Control Council's Cotton Control Committee is formed by important members of the Sino-Japanese cotton industry to promote control work and achieve the hope of increasing production. This is the completion of the Cotton Control Committee's important mission."</p>
<p>Minister Tajiri Hopes for Increased Production</p>
<p>Minister Tajiri said in his speech: "Today, the Cotton Control Committee is established, and I am very grateful for the invitation. In terms of materials in Central China, cotton and rice are the most important. This time, the mission of the Cotton Control Committee, whether viewed from the Chinese or Japanese perspective, can be said to be to meet the requirements of the current situation. Therefore, the future work and achievements will be focused on increasing production. From the perspective of the Cotton Control Committee, the results of cotton collection this year have been very good, and it is expected that the results of future purchases will be even better. I hope that the Cotton Control Committee will pay attention to how to increase production in the future. Obviously, increased production is greatly related to purchases. For the funds loaned for the collection of cotton, more attention should be paid to ensuring that they are loaned to the real farmers who produce cotton. I am an amateur in cotton and cannot make good contributions at all. Fortunately, the entire Cotton Control Committee is composed of experts in the cotton industry, and I hope you will pay attention to this important point."</p>
<p>Tang Shoumin Expresses Five Points</p>
<p>Briefly said: Regarding cotton, the importance of this material is closely related to both military needs and people's livelihood. Minister Chen and Minister Tajiri have already elaborated on this, so there is no need for me to repeat it. At this grand meeting, I would like to briefly express my humble opinions on various hopes: 1. For cotton collection, the most important thing is to set the price. The price should be set reasonably. 2. Setting a reasonable price is the basis for collecting sufficient cotton. It is hoped that the amount collected this year will reach the expected target. 3. In addition to collecting a large amount of cotton, it is also hoped that we can increase production next year. 4. The funds for cotton collection are the price that farmers should receive, and we must ensure that they are returned to the farmers as capital for their re-production. 5. Farmers may not understand the official plans, and it is hoped that we can enlighten them so that everyone can be of one mind and thoroughly understand the differences in old and new scales, etc., and listen to the official efforts with understanding. The Cotton Control Committee is an external organization of the Business Control Council, and some of the chairman, vice chairman, and committee members are also directors and supervisors of the Business Control Council. In addition to providing support from the Business Control Council, I would like to briefly express my hopes and wish the Cotton Control Committee complete success.</p>
<p>Chen Guangzhong Speaks on Developing Cotton Farmers</p>
<p>Chen Guangzhong, the representative of the Materials Control Review Committee, said in his speech that the focus of cotton collection work should be on enabling cotton farmers to develop in a balanced manner and achieving the purpose of unified purchase and distribution of cotton. Finally, Li Zuyu, chairman of the Huazhong Cotton Production Improvement Association, gave a speech on behalf of the attendees, hoping that after the establishment of the Cotton Control Committee, the discussion of the value of collected cotton should take into account the lives of farmers in order to achieve the goal of increasing production.</p>

<p>Two Islands Renamed</p>
<p>Shonan, 27th Central News Agency Electric - Chandra Bose declared at a meeting with the press corps yesterday: Japanese Prime Minister Tojo clarified on the second day of the Greater East Asia Conference that the Andaman and Nicobar Islands would be transferred to the Provisional Government of Free India. The Provisional Government has now decided to rename the Andaman Islands as the Martyr Islands and the Nicobar Islands as the Autonomous Islands.</p>
<p>Shonan, 27th Central News Agency Electric - Since the President of the Provisional Government of Free India, Chandra Bose, attended the Greater East Asia Conference and visited China and the Philippines, he returned to Shonan on the 25th. At noon on the 26th, he announced to members of the Southern Indian League, stating the following key points: Regarding my visit to Japan, the first thing I want to say is that the Japanese people are completely united and have absolute confidence in winning the Greater East Asia War. The purpose of the Greater East Asia Conference, in summary, is to complete the Greater East Asia War and establish a new order in East Asia. Burmese Prime Minister Ba Maw specifically proposed that all assistance should be given to India's struggle for freedom, which is especially meaningful as Burma is a friendly country to India. On my way back to Shonan, I visited the Republic of China and the Republic of the Philippines. Our belief in mutual unity and permanent cooperation is becoming firmer. The Japanese government's statement that it will transfer the Andaman and Nicobar Islands to the Provisional Government of Free India is of great significance to the Indian people, as we now have our own territory and have completed a government that matches its name and reality. All the prerequisites for the Indian people's actual struggle have been completed. Our work from now on is to start the final struggle to liberate ourselves from the shackles of Britain. For this struggle, we have abundant courage. The first thing we should do is to further expand and strengthen our current national military force and start the war. Part of our army has already begun to be stationed in the Indian border area. In order to reward the bravery of the soldiers on the front line, the government has prepared to announce a system of rewards and a law to protect the veterans who died or were injured in battle. Secondly, the preparations for my government to move to Burma have also been completed and will be realized soon. After the government moves to Burma, I will further strengthen contact with comrades from various agencies and strive to promote the mobilization plan. I firmly believe that the day when the Indian National Army will enter India is near, and the banner of the Indian National Army will be hoisted high over the British Governor's Mansion in New Delhi. This will require a long and arduous struggle, but the comprehensive preparations for handling all situations have been fully completed.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 27th – A Havas report from Washington states: The meeting of the three giants, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin, is imminent, and there is a possibility that Chiang Kai-shek from Chongqing will also participate. Washington political circles hope to establish a four-power conference. This new organization will establish a permanent headquarters in Washington. The United States intends to shift the center of balance in international policy back to Washington, thereby reducing the importance of the European Tripartite Committee in London. This four-power conference will handle issues of wartime and post-war cooperation among the anti-Axis countries. A certain Swedish correspondent stated: This meeting will face two difficulties. First, whether the Soviet Union is willing to participate in a global organization, as it must consider its relations with Japan. Washington is even more afraid that Stalin will insist that the location be in London because of the existence of the 20-year Anglo-Soviet treaty. And the Anglo-Soviet treaty will be the basis for the four-power conference before any new arrangements are made.</p>

After returning to the embassy, he spoke about his aspirations for his new post as follows: In the future, I will strive to further strengthen Japan-Thailand relations. If all the ethnic groups in Greater East Asia exert all their efforts and cooperate in this war, victory will surely belong to us. In the future, in order to promote relations between Japan and Thailand, we will first focus on cultural communication, because politics and culture have a close and inseparable relationship. Japan and Thailand must also understand each other culturally. Therefore, in addition to introducing Thai culture to Japan, it is also necessary to make Thais understand Japan. I hope to publish a "History of Japan" in Thai to enable Thais to further understand Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Japanese Planes Bomb Finschhafen, Heavily Damaging Enemy Infantry and Artillery Positions; Raiding Yangon, American Planes Shot Down Ten <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th – According to a report from a Japanese base in the South Pacific: On the afternoon of the 24th, at 3:00 PM, a joint formation of Japanese warplanes and bombers attacked enemy heavy artillery and infantry positions near Finschhafen, New Guinea, inflicting great damage. On the return journey, they engaged three enemy B25 aircraft at sea, shooting down one. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Yangon, 27th – The enemy air force stationed in India has recently continuously raided Myanmar, but has been repeatedly attacked and shot down by the Japanese air force. For example, on the 25th at 11:58 AM, ten enemy aircraft attacked the vicinity of Yangon. The Japanese army fighter squadron immediately took off to intercept them. After 20 minutes of fierce aerial combat, three enemy aircraft were shot down (one of which was confirmed), and the rest fled. Only one Japanese aircraft was damaged in this battle, and the crew members parachuted to safety. It is reported that the enemy aircraft (PAU251) type is the latest model manufactured by the North American aircraft factory, and is an excellent single-engine fighter, which has recently been transported to India. Also, from 1:00 PM to 2:30 PM that afternoon, 20 enemy aircraft of types (PAU40) North American (PAU25) and Four (PAU24) attacked Yangon again. The Japanese army's air and ground artillery immediately attacked, and eventually shot down three of the (PAU40) type (one of which was not confirmed). The Japanese side suffered no losses. Also, between 3:48 PM and 3:55 PM that afternoon, 13 North American enemy fighter-bombers jointly attacked the Nicaladon airfield and were again damaged by Japanese forces, forcing them to flee. The Japanese side suffered minimal losses. Enemy aircraft attacked the vicinity of Yangon again on the morning of the 26th with ten Wellington aircraft, and one was shot down and one was damaged by the Japanese army. The rest retreated, and the Japanese side suffered almost no losses.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Washington's Pipe Dream <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Shi</p>
<p>A ludicrous message</p>
<p>The capital of Uncle Sam – Washington, has once again passed along a most ludicrous message. What we find comical, our readers must also find laughable! The message goes like this: According to Washington radio broadcasts, on September 24th, Senator Tydings, representing Maryland, will submit a resolution to the Senate recognizing the immediate and complete independence of the Philippines, for discussion. Everyone knows that Senator Tydings is an advocate for Philippine independence and drafted the Philippine Independence Act. Readers should recall that the Independence Act stipulated that Philippine independence would be granted on July 4, 1946, ten years after its implementation. Now, according to reports from a few days ago, Tydings' resolution, submitted to the Senate for discussion, would amend the Act and grant the Philippines independence immediately, without having to wait until 1946.</p>
<p>The above is the latest news of the American attempt to deceive the 16 million people of the Philippines, as well as its entire political sphere. This news is truly worthy of derision. For it is feared that all Senators, save Tydings, know – and cannot not know – that the United States has long had no intention of granting the Philippines independence. America's influence in the Philippines has been completely eliminated since the surrender of the American forces on the island to the Japanese army in May of last year. Yet America still has idlers who talk about withdrawing American sovereignty from the Philippines! Comparing the Philippines to a family of free nations, giving it equal status – and continuing to make such useless and empty arguments.</p>
<p>However, America has ulterior motives for this laughable attitude towards the Philippines. They guarantee in Tydings' resolution that Uncle Sam will continue to work hard to liberate the Philippines. What do readers think of this? There is nothing more ludicrous than this guarantee. Why? Because, first, the people of the Philippines have been liberated from American control for over a year. Second, at the 82nd Japanese Diet session last June, Prime Minister Tojo had already declared that the independence desired by the Filipino people would be realized this year, without waiting for one or two years. Prime Minister Tojo's speech stated:</p>
<p>Japan's Attitude</p>
<p>"Our attitude towards Philippine independence has been explained repeatedly. Now we further declare that the glory of independence will be granted to the Philippines this year, so that the Filipino people, who have been painstakingly pursuing the illusion of independence for many years under the cunning American control, will gradually fulfill their long-cherished aspirations less than two years after the outbreak of this war."</p>
<p>Try comparing Japan's policy towards the Philippines with that of the United States. Uncle Sam wrote the so-called Philippine Independence Act into the statute books nine years ago, promising to allow it independence in ten years.</p>
<p>However, in 1934, when this Independence Act was passed, all of the Philippine intelligentsia were asking themselves: Why is independence not granted immediately? Why can't we wait another ten years? Of course, we fully understand the reasons for refusing immediate independence to the Philippines. There are two reasons: First, American imperialists are unwilling to lose control over the Filipino people; second, the supporters and friends of Philippine independence within the United States completely lack sincerity and a sense of justice regarding the question of Philippine independence. But now the stage manager for Philippine independence has no more work to do. The members of the new Philippine Republic's congress have been elected, and with great enthusiasm, they are determined to rebuild their country and contribute to the rapid completion of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere by assuming a glorious mission. Their industrious and sincere efforts will surely bear fruit in the near future, of this we can be undoubtedly certain.</p>
<p>A Sudden Change in Facts</p>
<p>Americans, who stubbornly refuse to understand and acknowledge the reality of the rapid changes occurring in East Asia, must at least acknowledge the following facts: First, the United States is now completely cut off from the Philippines; second, the Filipino people have already gained complete independence. That is an absolutely certain fact. On September 30th, three leaders from the Philippines visited Tokyo: Dr. Laurel, chairman of the Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee and presidential candidate; Mr. Vargas, chairman of the Philippine Executive Committee; and Mr. Aquino, candidate for speaker of the Philippine Congress, all of whom are confident in their ability to manage the new nation. Under the guidance of such outstanding politicians, the people of the new Philippine Republic have broken free from over forty years of American oppression and are enjoying their right to the longed-for life, freedom, and happiness.</p>
<p>Faced with this reality, yet challenging the common enterprise of building a co-prosperity sphere by all the nations of East Asia with military force, the war-mongering of the anti-Axis side cannot but be said to be an inexcusable crime. If they truly respect the rights of other ethnic groups and other nations to chart their own destinies, as they claim, then they have no reason to interfere in East Asian affairs. The nations of Greater East Asia only hope that no interference will hinder them, and only ask to chart and save their own path.</p>

<p>Xu Liqiu, head of the Chinese delegation to the Greater East Asia Press Conference and acting president of the China Daily News, returned to Shanghai by plane on the 26th after the closing of the conference due to public affairs, and made the following remarks:</p>
<p>I was warmly received and assisted by all parties during my trip to Japan to attend the Greater East Asia Press Conference, and I am very grateful. This conference brought together representatives from all over East Asia, which was unprecedented. Although the conference only lasted for two days, the atmosphere was harmonious, and there was no separation due to language issues. The most　gratifying thing was that the establishment of the Greater East Asia News Council, which had been negotiated for several years but had not been realized, was proposed by the Chinese delegation and unanimously supported by the conference. The entire proposal was passed. It was decided that, in addition to all the attending representatives from various countries being members, the members of the presidium (i.e., the heads of the delegations) would be the directors. After the members return to their countries, they will contact their domestic colleagues to join in succession. During this trip to Tokyo and other places, I deeply felt the high morale of the citizens of the allied nations under the wartime system, the strength of the war effort, and the perfection of national training. This further strengthened the belief of the attending representatives from various countries that the Greater East Asia War would be victorious, which was the most　valuable gain of this conference.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Group A Football Showdown: Friendship vs. Overseas Chinese United – 10:30 AM at Recreation Ground <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The highly anticipated Group A football match between Friendship and Overseas Chinese United will take place this morning at 10:30 AM at the Recreation Ground. The referee is Chen Jixiang, and the linesmen are Liu Chunshu and Gu Zhengzhu. Having lost to Overseas Chinese United in the Reporter's Cup, Friendship will undoubtedly seek revenge today. Meanwhile, the Donghua vs. Three Provinces match will be held at 3:30 PM at Jiaozhou Park. Originally, there were nine football league matches scheduled for today, but the Group B and C match between the Soviet Union and the Japanese Association has been postponed.</p>
<p>Analysis of Strengths</p>
<p>Friendship has lost Sun Jinshun and Zhang Lingen this year, but the addition of the "Ball Freak" Xu Wenkui has compensated for the loss, maintaining their strength. However, the retirement of "Lazy Cow" Li Yiju has forced Qu Yongfu to be moved forward, leading to the collapse of what was praised as the best central defense line. Nevertheless, A-Fu's forward position is exceptionally fierce, and with "Ball Freak" A-Kui taking charge as the central commander, the attacking power is quite remarkable. In terms of defense, Liu Xianhan is the goalkeeper, with Wu Qixiang and Li Tiansheng as defenders, forming an impenetrable wall. The overall team lineup is well-organized and solid. The Overseas Chinese United team is composed of both new and veteran stars. Their defense includes Victor and Xerxes, and their attack features Favic and Carlo Lequio. Last week, they defeated the Portuguese Business Association 5-3, demonstrating their supreme power. Today's match is crucial for their standings, and it is expected that both sides will give their all, resulting in an exciting and intense game.</p>
<p>Donghua vs. Three Provinces</p>
<p>Another Group A match, Donghua vs. Three Provinces, will be held at 3:30 PM at Jiaozhou Park on Changping Road. Donghua is expected to win without any problems. Tickets for both matches are priced at $40 and $20.</p>
<p>Today's Schedule: Overseas Chinese United vs. Friendship (Group A) 10:30 AM (Recreation Ground); Three Provinces vs. Donghua (Group A) 3:30 PM (Jiaozhou); French Business Association vs. Overseas Chinese (Group B) 10:15 AM (Jiaozhou); Zhenyuan vs. Nie School (Group C) 2:00 PM (Hongkou); Hequn vs. Zhenhua (Group C) 9:00 AM (East); Wuzhi vs. Shenghua (Group C) 10:30 AM (East); Elementary, Youlian (Group C) 2:00 PM (East); Customs vs. First Police (Group C) 3:30 PM (East)</p>
<p>Friendship: Liu Xianhan, Li Tiansheng, Wu Qixiang, Cai Shengmiao, Song Lingsheng, Zheng Yingquan, Qian Jingyong, Zhai Yongfu, Xu Wenkui, Gao Baozheng, Fei Chunhua (Reserves: Yu Zhenyue, Li Yichen)</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese United: Huang Zijie, Victor, Xerxes, Lang Shaoshan, Pan Tuosun, Xue Erfo, Jin Lusheng, Carlo Lequio, Fafanxiao, Yagefu, Shen Yi (Reserves: Borage, Pulihuo)</p>

<h3 id="e35">America Cancels Chinese Exclusion Act: Department Head Hirota's Remarks Criticizing American Hypocrisy <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: Hirota, a spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy in China, stated last night to the Central News Agency that the US Senate's passage of a bill to repeal the Chinese Exclusion Act, which would allow 105 Chinese immigrants to enter the United States each year, does not address the fundamental issue of equal treatment for East Asian people. The United Kingdom, the United States, and various Central and South American countries have long practiced discrimination against East Asian people. It would be ridiculous for the US government to believe that repealing the Chinese Exclusion Act would erase the racial prejudice that Americans have historically held towards Chinese and other East Asian people.</p>
<p>A Wartime Expedient Measure by the United States</p>
<p>It would be even more laughable if Chongqing believes that Chinese people will receive social and political equality. Hirota believes that the proposed repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act is a wartime expedient measure by the United States to prevent Chongqing from defecting from the Allied camp. The United Kingdom and its dominions, as well as various Central and South American countries, have always refused entry to East Asian people, and even Indians, who are British citizens, are not allowed to freely transit through British territory. Hirota continued by stating that the clear answer of the 1 billion East Asians to this question can be seen in Article 5 of the Joint Declaration announced at the recent Greater East Asia Conference in Tokyo, which states that "East Asian nations will strive to eliminate racial discrimination throughout the world." Laws excluding East Asian immigrants apply not only to Chinese people but also to the 1 billion people of the East. This is not only the case in the United States, but also in the United Kingdom and Central and South American countries.</p>
<p>The Real Motive: Appeasing Chongqing</p>
<p>Hirota continued by stating that allowing East Asian people to enter their countries is not an important fact, but the fundamental issue lies in their social and political lives after immigration. For those with a typical American mindset, allowing 105 Chinese immigrants to enter the United States each year is considered equal treatment for Chinese people. The bill to repeal the Chinese Exclusion Act was submitted to Congress last year, and despite strong opposition from traditional American racial prejudice, it was eventually passed by the Senate. This gesture demonstrates the US government's desire to appease the Chongqing regime. The true motive behind this "American high-minded behavior" with a false mask can be seen in the remarks of US Navy Admiral Yarnell before the Senate committee discussing the bill, who believed that the collapse of the Chongqing government was a serious possibility without effective assistance. Supporters of repealing the Chinese Exclusion Act have also stated that Chinese people cannot immigrate to the United States during wartime, and the US government is unwilling to grant Chinese immigrants equal treatment, advocating that this issue be reconsidered after the war. In other words, the US government has no sincerity in improving the treatment of Chinese people. Its sole purpose is to appease Chongqing and prevent it from defecting from the Allied camp.</p>
<p>The Slave Life of Chinese Laborers in the Past</p>
<p>The history of Chinese immigration to the United States can be traced back to the California Gold Rush. Chinese people went to the United States as slaves to supplement the shortage of railway workers and miners in the central and western parts of the United States. Many Chinese coolies died in the slave life in the railway construction camps in the Rocky Mountains and in the mines of Hui'anming and Timer. Hirota pointed out that if Chongqing believes that allowing 105 immigrants each year can compensate for the lives of previous immigrants, then they are not qualified to be leaders of the Chinese people. The Chinese people are determined to restore China. Historically, Chinese people who immigrated to the United States were treated as slaves. In 1871, the United States recruited a large number of Chinese laborers in Ningbo, promising them excellent pay. However, as soon as the ship left Chinese territorial waters, the cabins where the Chinese laborers were living were sealed off, and no supplies were provided. When the ship arrived in Yokohama, the Chinese laborers dispatched two representatives to request assistance from the Japanese authorities. The Japanese government immediately intervened and, during the trial, recognized the ship as a slave ship, and all the Chinese laborers on board were freed. Although the ship's destination was Peru, many other ships of the same nature sailed to the United States, and the Chinese migrants who were deceived into slavery were all freed. In conclusion, Hirota reiterated that the fundamental issue is not the admission of a small number of Chinese people into the United States, but the key point is equal treatment. If Chongqing cannot see through the American appeasement policy and cannot grasp its true meaning from the standpoint of the Chinese people, then Chongqing will become a traitor to East Asia.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Hua Stock Spot Transactions Must Not Be Implemented Without Approval, Still Limited to Spot Next-Day Delivery <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Since the Hua Stock Exchange opened on the 8th, it has temporarily limited transactions to spot next-day delivery of Hua stocks and designated the Guoxin Bank to handle delivery settlement matters. In order to facilitate the delivery of various stocks, the exchange considered implementing a new "convenient delivery" system for spot transactions, stipulating that delivery would be handled every Monday and that speculation and manipulation would be curbed in accordance with the business rules. Yesterday, reporters learned from brokers that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry had ordered the administrator of the exchange not to implement the convenient delivery system for spot transactions without approval. Furthermore, trading in Hua stock futures is temporarily prohibited, so the implementation of "convenient delivery" for spot transactions is not likely to materialize in the short term. It was also learned that the exchange has temporarily suspended trading since the 25th due to calculation issues with Hua stocks established on the 23rd and 24th of this month, which have not yet been settled. Trading will resume after settlement is completed, but the principle of spot next-day delivery will still be followed.</p>

<p>All Associations Must Submit Reports Quickly</p>
<p>In order to unify the allocation of flour and bran, the Flour and Wheat Special Committee, with the approval of the Commercial and Trade Council, established the "Shanghai District Flour Bran Allocation Office" to handle the unified allocation of flour in the city. It has been learned that the Allocation Office will officially open on December 1st and has already notified various associations, such as the Tea and Gold Industry Association, to quickly submit the rosters of their members within three days of receiving the notice in order to facilitate allocation. The opening dates of each member's store must also be indicated. All industries that use flour as a raw material have been notified to comply. Subsequently, the Allocation Office will determine the allocation quota based on the actual needs of the members according to the membership roster. The association will allocate the quota to each member, and non-members of the association will not be entitled to allocation rights.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Hua Stock Trends <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Hua stocks continued to fluctuate within a narrow range. During the stock exchange's suspension, a small number of firms engaged in active trading outside the exchange. Although the end of the month was approaching and there were sellers seeking cash, strong buyers absorbed the supply, and many new and old stocks generally rose. A breakdown of various industry stocks follows:</p>

National Goods alone remained flat. China Underwear suddenly rose by nearly one dollar. Kwong Wah Department Store traded to a price far above its par value. Lane Crawford remained flat.</p>
<p>Textiles: Wing On Textile had the smallest fluctuations, closing flat. China Textile saw another increase. Sino-British Cotton traded at a lower price than the afternoon of the previous day. Yung Feng, Five Harmony, Yuen Fung, and Kwong Kwan also saw strong gains. New Feng, Mei Lun, Lun Wah, Sino-French, Ta Kung, and Chen Fong all made progress. King Fook Hosiery rose several cents. King Lun remained flat. Mei Ya Silk Factory suddenly rose sharply. Yuen Yuen Dyeing continued to trend firm.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Translation and Commentary: The Issue of Currency Adjustment in the Su-Huai Region <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The Su-Huai region, located in a special state bordering North China, can demonstrate centralization and promote the self-strengthening efforts of the National Government through this currency adjustment. This epoch-making policy will be implemented starting next month and will have a significant impact on the economic circles of both China and Japan. General sentiment is that it should be fully supported because this measure not only expands the circulation area of the Central Reserve Bank notes but also carries political significance, namely, that it can promote the integration of politics and economy. Furthermore, the implementation of this policy will gradually lead to reasonable solutions to various fundamental issues such as financial exchange, material exchange, and others between North and Central China, thereby enabling China's economic unification to embark on a path of independent development.</p>
<p>The Su-Huai region was designated as a special administrative area under the jurisdiction of the National Government in February 1942. However, in terms of economics, the circulation and use of the United Reserve Bank notes were governed by the North China Political Affairs Commission until today. As a result, administration and economics were divided into two separate spheres, which inevitably led to contradictions and obstacles in policy implementation. The current determination to make adjustments can at least strengthen the economic ties between Central and North China, increase the credit of the Central Reserve Bank notes, and strengthen the foundation of the Central Reserve Bank. These are all foreseeable effects. However, it is important to avoid taking drastic measures during implementation, as this could lead to competition between the two currencies and hinder the work of acquisition and transaction operations. Therefore, a gradual approach must be adopted. This point has already been emphasized in the statements of Finance Minister Zhou of the National Government.</p>
<p>Regarding the exchange transaction plan, we believe that freedom should be given within the scope of the plan to smoothly promote the exchange of materials between the two regions. For example, the formal recognition and public permission of Huai-Shanghai exchange is also a matter worth considering. In the past, the national capital of North China has always depended on Central China for development. Now, the Chinese financial community is eager for both sides to be able to exchange and develop mutually. The exchange of national capital between Central and South China must also be closely developed. By following this path, we can expect the completion of the unification of Chinese national capital.

<h3 id="e41">Weekly Commentary (Continued from Page 1) <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The meaning of the speech is self-evident, perhaps already understood. But to summarize its content succinctly: The age-old aspiration of Asia is to drive out Western European imperialism and achieve liberation, and this has already been resolved by Japanese military force in today's Greater East Asia War. At the same time, Japan today is no longer the Japan of five years ago. It has now become the towering leader of all of Greater East Asia. It has not only abolished the unequal treaties that hindered China's construction, but also promised in the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty that it will withdraw its troops as soon as full peace is achieved between China and Japan. If so, why are China and Japan fighting each other? This is something that I cannot understand. If the Chinese people are willing, they can achieve Chinese unification within 24 hours. Chinese gentlemen! Why are you still hesitating? Don't miss a single second, stand up! Make a decision!—This is the general idea.</p>
<p>This is a perfect depiction of the current situation in Asia! At the same time, we should ponder that the liberation and unity of Asia must be achieved simultaneously. If liberation is not accompanied by unity, then the liberated people will soon be in danger of being sacrificed by Anglo-American imperialism. After giving this warning, it is strongly emphasized that in order to achieve true liberation, it is necessary to complete the great unity of East Asia simultaneously with liberation. If you want to complete the liberation and unity of Asia, then you must first advance to the stage of the unification of China and the freedom of India. For the liberation of India, and thus for the liberation and unity of East Asia, the unification of China, that is, the realization of the unification of China, which resolves the Sino-Japanese problem, is a prerequisite.</p>
<p>Are not the Anglo-Americans who split and conflict China to create two countries and to establish permanent objects of exploitation as the conspiracy of imperialism enemies? Is not Japan, which considers itself an "era of equality and assistance" and sincerely offers love, friendship, and respect to its friendly nation China with the intention of making China permanently exist in the world, a partner? This is obvious at a glance and does not require further explanation.</p>
<p>I would like to say a few words to my Chinese friends. That is, you must recognize that the modern era is not an era of conquest and exploitation, but an era that has changed to an era of equality and assistance. Furthermore, you must recognize that the series of policies toward China since Japan's Konoe Statement are all based on this recognition of the era of equality and assistance. At the same time, the mission and responsibility of realizing this on a global scale are placed on the friendly relationship between China and Japan. The establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is expected, and this unwavering belief and reason, based on this self-awareness, is constantly growing and developing. If you interpret this Japanese policy toward China as aggression, as a form of imperialism, it is as wrong as calling a horse a deer. If you think that the substance is the same because the form is the same, then you will inevitably be regarded as a fool who cannot see through the leap of history and the changes in the ideas flowing deep within history. I believe that what saved East Asia was not so much the great victory of Japan in the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, but rather the Twenty-One Demands and the Manchurian Incident from the perspective of China. These were the deep-rooted and good foundations for protecting East Asia today. If there were no Twenty-One Demands back then, there would be no Manchurian Incident. If there were no Manchurian Incident, then what would the world of East Asia be like today?</p>
<p>In order to protect East Asia and achieve great unity, we must rewrite the fifty years of Sino-Japanese diplomatic history written in foreign languages in the past. Japan and the United Kingdom and the United States, with completely different moods and ideals, are ostensibly so-called imperialism, but they are actually the same in form but different in substance, seemingly similar but not so. As long as you look at Japan's China policy after the Manchurian Incident through this mirror of historical truth, you can correctly understand its true meaning. The philosophy in Boss's words can only be made more brilliant and brilliant if it is confirmed from this perspective.</p>
<p>I appeal to the people of China and Japan to rewrite the Sino-Japanese diplomatic history written in European and American languages over the past fifty years! Then recognize the reality of East Asia and restore the natural posture of China and Japan! This is the only way to complete the liberation of East Asia. This is the only way to simultaneously achieve liberation and unity, as Boss said, in one fell swoop. This is the only way to build the great unity and the new order of Greater East Asia, the long-cherished wish of East Asia. (Ji Translation)</p>

<h3 id="e42">The Bureau of Commercial and Trade Considers the Poor, Allocating Winter Clothing Fabric Early <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>After this newspaper received generous donations of winter clothing from enthusiastic benefactors, it immediately undertook the task of purchasing materials and making clothes. Yesterday, we were fortunate to receive early allocation of cotton cloth from the Bureau of Commercial and Trade, totaling 11 pounds of cotton cloth at $500 per bolt and 10 pounds of lining cloth at $440 per bolt (cotton is still being purchased). The length of the cotton coat is 2 feet 3 inches, and the length of the cotton trousers is 2 feet 3.5 inches. The materials used are 8 feet 8 inches of black fabric for the outer layer, 9 feet 2 inches of white fabric for the lining, and 2 pounds and 4 taels of cotton. The cost of materials and sewing, etc., is approximately $160 per set (this is still an approximate price; the exact number will be known after the cotton is procured). A detailed cost account will be published at a later date. The organizers are working completely voluntarily. We plan to produce 5,000 sets, which will require approximately $480,000, far exceeding the current donations. We hope that people from all walks of life will enthusiastically donate to save the poor and needy of Shanghai. The merit is immeasurable. Donors who wish to deliver the clothes themselves can obtain winter clothing tickets from the donation collection office to distribute themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e43">The YMCA Launches a Winter Clothing Charity Sale <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the display and sale of calligraphy and paintings by famous figures of the past and present at the YMCA's winter clothing charity market, other items will be sold publicly from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM today on the second floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. A wide variety of items are available. People from all walks of life are welcome to participate enthusiastically.</p>

<p>The Youyou Nursery will hold a fundraising announcement and reception at the Jindu Grand Theatre at 10:00 AM today, along with entertainment programs including performances by the staff club of the First District Public Office, the Jingwu Athletic Association, and students of the nursery. Admission tickets are distributed to various circles.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Winter Clothing Donation Report <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Since this office has received generous donations for winter clothing from enthusiastic people from all walks of life, the amount has reached more than 30,000 yuan. In recent days, as the weather has warmed slightly, donations have gradually decreased. However, in the blink of an eye, the north wind is blowing and severe winter is approaching. In order to prepare as soon as possible, this office has applied to the relevant authorities for cotton cloth to rush to make winter clothing. However, the amount of donations is far from the original target, and we await continued support from all walks of life. We hope you will show your benevolence and make donations early so that we can make more winter clothing and benefit the poor. We are deeply grateful to the entire body of students in the Chu Shang 2 and Chu 2 Bing classes of Mingde Girls' High School for donating 1,100 yuan. In addition, De Shan Ji Ji donated 50 yuan, Huang Yu 300 yuan, and Xue Shao Sheng 1,000 yuan, totaling 2,450 yuan. The total amount outstanding is 39,660.50 yuan. Acknowledgment: Thank you to Mr. Shen for sending a western-style overcoat, six western-style suits, and six pairs of shoes and socks, instead of donating winter clothing money to this office. We thank you on behalf of the beneficiaries.</p>
