<p>社評</p>
<h3>論國民外交</h3>
<p>自從大東亞戰爭爆發以來，東亞各國即進入空前的新時代，中日兩國的關係也就進入更密切的新階段，特別是中國參戰以後，兩國所負的時代使命更形重大，為求大東亞戰爭之最後勝利，不僅有賴於兩國當局的努力，尤有賴乎兩國人民的協作與奮鬥。舉凡政治，經濟，文化各方面的合作，都需要兩國民間的合作，才能收穫眞正的效果。否則儘管政府當局怎樣努力，結果也不免事倍功半。國民外交促進會將於今日宣吿成立，也許就是爲了有鑒於此吧。不過，不言「國民外交」則已，否則，下列幾點，似乎値得熱心於「國民外交」諸君子的注意的。</p>
<p>第一，從理論上說，國民外交，可以輔助政府外交之不足，所以，在近代進步的國家，平時就很注意於國民外交。可是，從中日兩國關係說，過去並沒有所謂「國民外交」。從和平運動發動以來，也沒有眞正的國民外交，特別是在中國宣吿參戰以後的今日，兩國政府密切合作，已不成問題：那麼，今日的「國民外交」，其主要任務，自然不是輔助政府外交的不足，而是針對着目前兩國密切關係，適應這種新的形勢，使兩國人民之互相了解，互相携手，就覺得更爲重要了。所以，今日的國民外交，其重心應該放在增進中日兩國人民的澈底了解與携手合作上面。</p>
<p>第二，過去六十多年間，由於英美的挑撥離間，造成了中日兩國間的猜忌和仇恨，特別是從中日事變以後，兩國人民間之心理上，存在着猜疑的暗影，甚至不免於仇恨，這是不容諱言的。經過這幾年來兩國當局的努力倡導和平，進而締結盟約，在人民心理上，似乎漸漸可以有些轉變，由猜疑而諒解；然而，無論如何，這必然是需要經過相當悠長的時間，經過雙方朝野的努力。可是，說一句老實話，過去友邦親善的言詞超過了親善的事實；那麼，人民聽到親善的言詞，便感不到什麽價値了。所以，今後要有國民外交的話，便得協助當局，以求改變過去的現象，尤望友邦親善的事實，要超過親善的言詞，方可收得功效。</p>
<p>第三，現在兩國當局倡導國民外交，即爲重視民意的先聲。在戰時，國民外交所能做到的，自然僅有融洽感情一點，而就是這一點，就足爲兩國民間百年合作的出發點，所以希望兩國當局對這一點加以鄭重的注意，多以親善的事實昭吿人民，如糧食問題，必須迅速獲得合理解決，以减少人民的痛苦。只要從事實上多多表現出中日兩國合作的眞誠，兩國民間的感情才能眞正的融洽，也只有兩國民間的眞誠融洽，兩國的合作才有眞實的效力希望倡言國民外交者，萬勿忽視這一點。</p>
<p>最後，我們希望「國民外交」勿成爲一空洞的口號與標語，要切切實實的做出些事業來。尤望兩國人民必須平等待遇，要知過去英美民族政策的失敗，就是以優等民族自居，而以殖民地劣等民族以視我東亞人民，所以徒然引起東亞民族的反抗。我們東方民族相互之間，特別是中日兩國相互之間，尤需做出榜樣來，一反英美之所爲，完全實現「民族平等」的理想，無論在中國在日本，無論對華僑以及對其他佔領區內的中國人民，都要充分表現出平等友善親愛的精神，這樣才能澈底轉變過去的現象，而所有這些，正是今日言「國民外交」者所急須努力以求其實　的。</p>

<h3>英國必須放棄印度麼（一）　一月十一日澳門轉來</h3>
<p>美國星期六郵報於九月十二日登載愛特伽，斯諾這一篇從孟買以電報發出的印度通訊，內容比較具體，材料亦　為廣泛，茲譯出以供參考。　—譯者—</p>
<p>目前在印度，由於兩只大鉗夾得愈來愈接近，（德國正在西北方面衝擊着最後的豆大障礙，企圖參入亞洲，而日本則自東方準備進攻孟加拉。）</p>
<p>特別地由於印度國民大曾反對英國的國內鬥爭，印度很顯然再不能在世界政治之中僅僅担任靜止的角色了。印度的非暴力主義正製造着動的歷史。</p>
<p>英國人回答甘地的「離開印度！」的要求，是逮捕印度國民大會的領袖們，其結果是廣泛的擾亂和流血，這比印度近來的任何團體衝突更來得惡劣。因此，全世界的注意力就不得不集中在民主陣營之中，這個主要的政治問題上面來。</p>
<p>在國民大會的孟買會議議決「離開印度！」的提案之前，在英國以壓迫來對付不服從運動的計劃之前，最能感到印度民族主義的脈博的地方是一個名叫華德哈的小城。該城在印度中央諸省的中部，位於兩條主要鐵路綫的交叉之處，居民約三萬人。</p>
<p>華德哈的所以重要，倒不是因為它有什麼特別動人之處。這地方的溫度總在一百二十度左右，每年都熱死許多人。水是混濁的，當我訪問該城的時候，有霍亂病，而且居民之中很多人患著瘧疾。土地多沙，風景平凡而乏味。</p>
<p>從在一輛名為「湯加」的原始性質的車子裏，被衰老而　瘦的馬拉着，受了一　　的罪之後，可以看到滿地　仙人掌的骯髒鄉村。鄉村看上去仿佛是介乎三　牧場和難民所之間的東西。從泥濘的小路上走進去，到達一所和其他的屋子相像的矛屋。屋子是泥造的，蓋上一點棕葉，算是屋頂。屋子外面圈着木柵，泥牆上粗俗地浮雕着一個「却爾加」（紡車輪），陰沉的牛在附近徘徊着，—印度牛和駱駝的脾氣非常壞—憔悴的雞　在院子裏昂頭　步。　　一個老人赤着脚坐在草蓆編成的地板上，身體美好地包裹在幾碼長的粗布中，沒有牙齒，意料之外的強壯而廣闊的胸脯上長着灰白的毛，瘦骨峻峻的膝蓋之間有一輛紡車。</p>
<p>你們大約早就猜到了這個老人就是聖雄甘地。而在蝎子和毒蛇聚集着的房屋和雞牛之羣中，聚集着實行甘地的教義的奇特而和善的職工和勞力者。這里是英國主要的苦惱之所在，這里是使邱吉爾頭痛的地方。在這里，甘地為印度影響最大的政治刊物「哈里真週刊」寫下文章。作為一個新聞記者，甘地仿佛是陶樂賽，托姆　和陶樂賽，狄克斯（譯注：美國兩個著名的女記者）的混合物。他對於每一個問題的主張也正都像太太小姐們一樣　強。從　告年輕小姐們個人行為應該如何如何起，到推薦給邱吉爾以如何進行戰爭的方　為止，他都討論。如果美國人像印度人虔誠地信從甘地那樣追隨陶樂賽們，世界會變一個樣子的。</p>
<p>雖然，事實上這個朱古律色的米老鼠，（這綽號是他多年的信徒　都夫人替他取的）對於印度，仍然是現世界最重要的人。你要不明白甘地，不去見見他，你就不能了解印度國民大會的行動。</p>
<p>我在參拜甘地之前，先從印度的這一頭旅行到另一頭。我在阿拉　巴德出席了全印國民大會的一次會議，并且在那裏化費許多領頭和民族主義者們談話，之後，我旅行加爾各答，德里，孟買等地，為了找尋政治方面折裏的意見，我訪問了反戰的社會主義者們，贊成戰爭的共產主義者們，學生領袖們，傾向軸心國的人們如蘇巴斯，鮑斯之類，回教徒之中附和　納的人們，以及要人和實業家們。</p>
<p>然而總似乎缺乏共同的意見，在這些人中間很難找到一個焦點，真是奇怪，最後使我相信必須馬上拜訪我十年來並未謀面的甘地，倒是印度總督本人。他說：「把甘地除外，就無所謂國民大會。過去國民大會是他的組織，現在還是如此，在他死掉以前，國民大會總是他的。國民大會的樞軸是甘地的政治天才。」這也真是這樣，至於說國民大會是印度的民族主義，總督是不會承認的—這一節以後再談。</p>
<p>甘地的言論很少是豫先準備好答案的，很明顯地，他一定以為別人都擅長於唯物政治方面的術語，他的宣言之類，內容極其曖昧，這使他仿佛說　一點是政治上丑角，說好一點是自相矛盾且舉幾個例子：</p>
<p>幾個月之前，甘地宣佈除非國民大會和回教同盟之間成立協定，印度是永遠不能獨立起來的。而現在，他却指責印度共產黨堅持國民大會和回教同盟的團結，說是不對，說是獨立第一，團結就會跟在後面來的。</p>
<p>當他最近又一次進行為爭取完全獨立的「最後的鬥爭」的時候，他說這個運動對英國人極為有利。他的提議是「用最最友愛的精神表達出來的」。甘地說：「反英麼？誰反英？我麼？不不，我是從頭到脚都是親英的」。</p>
<h3>荷蘭國會開會</h3>

<h3>中國參戰後　中日協力的新認識　大東亞省參事官</h3>
<p>— 岡崎嘉平太著</p>
<p>譯自一月十二日東京每日新聞</p>
<p>本文作者岡崎氏，係日本岡山縣人，大正二年（中華民國二年）畢業於東京帝國大學法學部政治學科，其後即入日本銀行任職，中國事變勃發後，於昭和十二年（民國廿六年）十一月，任該行國外匯兌課長。昭和十四年入華興銀行為理事，該行係當時華中唯一的對日協力之發券銀行。氏自是即致力於華中之對外貿易決算問題，並研究上海公共租界之財政。大東亞省成立，即入該省為參事，直至於今。</p>
<p>國民政府的參戰，是大東亞戰爭發動後必然的結論，對於受了美英惡魔的誘惑，正在把自己立脚地的東亞毀於自己之手的抗日政權，由此當可予以最後的反省機會。同時，明白地指示出中國民眾應走的路。日華的協力，也將由此被極度的要求，經濟合作及其他方面的提携，其基本的理念及其方式，也有了更新的鞏固。</p>
<p>治外法權的撤廢和租界的交還，恐怕已是國民政府還都之前，日本早就採取着的基本的外交方針吧。隨著國民政府的還都，乃逐次成為具體化的準備，今日遂至走上了實踐的第一步。日本對於撤廢治外法權一事，明治維新以來，早有了多年苦鬥的經騐，因之以道養為外交基調的日本朝野，常同情於鄰國的立場，衹要中國有了能與日本提携而足以信賴之政府出現，當必率先實行此事。此種意念，早已有之，實屬當然。余頗諒解中國朝野及日本的真意，故切望中國官民，能相依相扶，努力於新中國的建設，衷心協助日本現正賭國運以博新東亞的建設，排斥美英侵略東亞的大事業。</p>
<p>汪主席所領導的更生中國，當可由此而顯其為一名副其實的獨立國家。然而國民政府還都以後，為日尚淺，民眾愛戴之忱，尚未十分濃厚，而且當此大東亞戰爭方與未艾之際，政府實力的強化，組織的整備等，自不容易：加之，中國民眾之中，迷於美英的宣傳，今尚抱着首鼠兩端的態度而逡巡其間者，亦復不少，故余以為望其能即有舉國一致的精神，尚非易事。實則，中國政府和民眾的關係，不用說乃是和日本有着迥異之點的。數千年來「撫我則君，虐我則　」的思想，至今猶潛在於各種地方。故必須徹底了解此等的政治事情，民族性，以及中國國民經濟組織的現階段等，今後的日本，非用和它切合的實踐方法，與以充分的援助不可；又中國的官民，亦非打開其胸襟，隨時來求商求助於日本，以向其國家組織的充實完備之途邁進不可。</p>
<p>兩國的親善提携，必須見之於物質和精神兩方面，自不待言。然而在經濟方面，兩國國民間所負的任務尤多。兩國國民既在多年的租界及治外法權之範圍中活動而來，故使其能順應於新事態，暫時當是　不是容易的事。就中國人說，租界以及外國人權益之治外法權，在種種的意　上，也可說是他們生命財產的安全地帶，所以現在不無稍呈寒風之感，這是可以察知的。故彼此兩國官方，對於此點，非多多加以考慮而盡力於民眾的保護不可。</p>
<p>然就中國人士言之，最重要的事，莫如對於新事態之正確的認識。換句話說，兩國人士，必須對於這個恐怕在歷史上不當見之世界性的大改革內容，和展開於眼前的大東亞戰爭的意義，加以徹底的理解，因而改變其向來的頭腦。須知陳舊的頭腦，遲早是不能適應時勢的，歷史的巨輪，決不會倒轉，它已老早撅起其隆隆的聲音前進着。把這個聲音留在心耳裏細細去聽，則以為自今而始的日華新關係，便能意外地瞭解其有着深遠的歷史根底，於是新的覺悟也就自然而生了，這是一定的道理。</p>
<p>將在新的日華關係之下而展開的各種問題，吾人對之，現在亦有種種的期待和希望，現在就其中之一的最大問題，即所謂經濟合作來說，則今後日華合辦的事業，更將繼續擴張，而且非如此不可。由於在工作上兩國人士互相携手，其利害亦交錯而行，於是兩國的連繫方見確固。然而即此點而言，則美，英，荷作為其殖民地政策而施於東亞的那樣手段，即巧的地抑制中國本身的產業，不使發達，俾中國永久淪為他們的商品市場，這種手段，吾人決不以能步其後塵。余以為兩國人士當排斥此種美英式的榨取，無論是工業是農業，因被抵制而未獲發達，以致到了今日有所不足者，則不管是技術，是機械，是擔當經營者，或是資本，應由中國方面進而求諸日本；日本亦應如其所求而急速供給之，互以其所長補其所短，以圖兩國之經經之渾然一體化，使東亞的經濟力得以強化，此實為孫總理之理想的大亞洲主義實質的基礎，同時亦為表現這次國民政府的參戰，及隨之而來的新事態之意義，而又為所以順應歷史之要求者。（丁譯）</p>

<h3>嚴厲搜查私運糧食　內地統一收購　限制都市資金流入糧區　　糧食部擬調整滬市供給</h3>
<p>新設之糧食部爲統制糧食收買工作起見、擬限制各都市資金流入糧食生產區、結果如何、頗値重視、糧食部此種計劃、意在防止奸商之活動、此項辦法如見實施、則糧食將不用現款收買、如是、並可防範內地通貨之膨脹、</p>
<p>收買產區　食米應市</p>
<p>據悉糧食部擬向各產區收買食米、調整上海區域之食米供應、試以蕪湖產區百、當地米穀棧存量僅有十萬石、糧食部皖南辦事處即根據此項調查、決定十萬石中收買六萬石、（收買價上等二百六十六元、次等二百六十二元、）餘四萬石留爲當地民食之用、但因對於零售價格未加限制、以致米價日見昂貴、就十四日而言、該地高機米每石一等爲三百八十元、二等爲三百二十元、</p>
<p>放鬆物資　移動限制</p>
<p>消息靈通人士稱、內地各物價、雖有地方物價對策委員會與物價管理局加以管理、但因各地管理物價之機關缺乏橫的聯繫、以致造成地方物價日見分歧之形勢、即以無錫與杭州兩地而論、後者平均價格耶較前者騰貴兩倍、或謂兩地物價之不同、係由於存貨之多寡不等、關係官方認爲如此欲加以調整、非放鬆和平區內物資之移動限制不可、否則無錫雖有多量之存貨、而商人以杭州物價如此髙昂、勢必不願出售其存貨、其影響且足使無錫物資之上市、亦欠圓活、</p>
<p>夾帶私售　查禁極嚴</p>
<p>昨自關係方面探悉、當局爲諜澈底杜絕私販牟利安定人心起見、故對於任何人、凡携有笨重包裹、而圖穿越各重要地區者、一律須經過嚴格之搜查、倘　出夾有任何一糧之食糧、及其製品者、即將其貨物沒收處分、其滬市四郊若浦東江灣七寳虹橋徐匯等地、仍有不法雜糧米店、將國米等抬價售與米販、偷運入境、對整個統制糧政、有所妨碍、故商得各該地當局同意、絕對禁止糧食米店不法出售米糧、並已於前日起、禁止各糧食米店營業以資統制、</p>
<p>局米蔴袋　仍應繳還</p>
<p>工部局情報處公吿云、查關於收買麻袋一事、業經本局於本月十八日以第六二三七號布吿公布在案、茲查所謂收買一節、並非指本局提付各食品店雕酒菜館工廠以及其他購領大量供給團體之裝米所用之麻袋而言、此項麻袋、仍應照常送還北蘇州路一〇四號木局麻袋儲藏所核收</p>

<h3>敬請當局注意　市區計口授糧</h3>
<p>— 永言</p>
<p>本壇日昨發表白虹君關於改善北站進口秩序一文後，迭有讀者來函、報吿類此的事，足見此問題對於行旅，關係殊大。不僅火車站應改善秩序，即汽車站及輪埠等交通秩序，均應改善。切盼讀者惠賜身歷困難實况，以及改善辦法之建議，以便貢獻於有關當局，籍諜改善。</p>
<p>自從當局爲抑平黑市糧價，絕對禁止自由移米後，上海民衆，企盼當局早定增加戶口食糧辦法，實如大旱之望雲霓，最近報載兩租界戶口米有逐漸增加消息，雖尙未見諸事實，然已足使兩租界外之市區居民表示十二萬分的羨慕。筆者住在滬西，而在浦東服務，故對市區計口授糧現狀，知悉較詳，茲縷述最近所受之苦痛與最低之希望如下：</p>
<p>（一）確定授糧日期　兩租界計口授糧，十日爲一期，規定數量及價格，先期在報端公佈。市區（南市滬西閘北浦東各地）自十一月份起，倣照租界辦法，發給購米證，但購米日期，並不確定，現已一月中旬，而一月份之購米證，尙木發下。市區居民大都從事生產事業，以職工與小販爲最多，家有存糧者佔極少數，現在不但無力購買黑市米與雜糧，且無處購買，官方配給，又復遙遙無期，眞是不勝焦急之至。</p>
<p>（二）根據實際需要增加口糧</p>
<p>市區授糧計劃，數月以前雖有每人每日三合之傳說，實際配給數量，則較兩租界相差甚遠、十二月份每人憑購米證所得數量如下：</p>
<p>第一次（十二月中旬發給）糙米一升零半合，碎米四合；第二次（十二月底）白米一升四合半，麵粉一斤半；第三次（一月七八日發給）糙米六合，碎米七合。</p>
<p>十一月份以前屢次延期取消，按兩租界現在每十天所發之米麵，僅够五天之需，而市區十二月份之實際配給，不敷更鉅。當局旣具抑平糧價之決心，故希望根據實際需要，增加戶口米糧。</p>
<p>總之，上海爲中國工商業之要地，糧食問題不解決，屢屢引起從事生產事業之職工心理上的不安，而居住浦東滬西等市區之人口，亦在一百五十萬人以上，多數爲職工階層，故爲鞏固上海工商業之基礎起見，對於市區居民的糧食取得，希望當局格外注意。</p>
<p>最後，筆者寫稿旣竟，得悉浦東日內即將發配一月份之第一次口糧，每人配給數量約二升，並無搭配麵粉，　西則尙無消息，日期旣不準確，配給量又較兩租界爲少。筆者向在工廠服務，最近目擊數十職工及家屬感受食糧不足的壓迫，終日在貧苦生命綫上掙扎，問題相常嚴重，每人期待當局積極救濟之意念，極爲　切，盼望當局加以補救，俾得安心工作，努力從事生產。</p>

<h3>大宗煤斤源源運滬　燃料存底充實　四千噸開平煤日前運到　煤商囤貨變現乏人問津</h3>
<p>本市各關係當局、鑒於烟白煤斤、用度數額、殊不遜於食糧等主要物品、爰各分頭設法、積極疏通國內大宗煤斤、以資源源運滬應銷、數月於茲、烟白煤斤運滬數額、不無與日俱增、記者昨向煤業方面探悉、日輪永昌丸業於本月十六日山秦皇島駛抵此間、停泊浦江第二十九號·三十號浮筒、該輪裝有開平統煤四千噸左右、是項煤斤、係上海自來水公司定貨、業於日前開艙過駁應用、聞其產價、頗爲低廉</p>
<p>煤斤運滬　絡繹於途</p>
<p>記者又自另一方面獲悉、最近煤斤運滬、益趨暢旺、良以水陸輸運便捷之故、据悉、除一部分煤斤、係由水上船隻、次第運抵此間外、一部分則山津浦及海南兩鐵道火車裝來·每次　裝數額、多寡不一、該項煤斤、大都米自華北各產煤區、其餘則由朝鮮運來、因當地煤產豐富、不無供過於求、故價格低廉、煤商若辦貨抵此照限價脫售、尙可獲厚利、</p>
<p>存底日增　市況穩定</p>
<p>查本市烟白煤斤用途、頗已較諸過去减少、一因工廠省燃、二因居民撙節、此則因受價格過髙影饗之故、爲此銷路呆滯、存底小無激增、昨据熱諳煤市者吿稱、目前堆存浦東·虹口·滬西·暨法租界各棧房之烟白煤斤、統共不下數十萬噸之譜、並因用途見减、去路無過去暢旺、故現貨煤斤、問津者乏人、市况已趨極度穩定、綜之、煤斤供應、當無匱乏之虞云、</p>

<p>竹內氏繼稱、渠此次返國、與政府當局有所磋商、依個人視察所得、一般關係官商人士、均認爲「上海經濟再建設」、乃解決中國爭端之必要條件、目下日本各種輕工業工廠正擬移來上海、作新發展、以便擔當復興經濟之使命。如此、上海將爲東亞輕工業之重心、而本市經濟發展、可望有劃時代之轉變、此外、鑒於上海與日本全國動員經濟關係之密切、上海之經濟機構、必須建築於水久性之基礎上、</p>

<h3>對於中儲舉辦同業短期拆放之觀感</h3>
<p>— 兼言</p>
<p>滬市金融，自去年十二月十五日後，即呈銀根緊縮之現象。至最近數日，由於農曆年關將屆，各業均辦理淸算，銀根因之益趨緊俏。茲者中儲滬分行，爲調劑各同業頭寸起見，毅然舉辦同業短期拆放。其辦法爲各同業可以下列各項　（一）公共租界或法租界內之不動產，（二）聨合準備會發行之公單及公庫證，（三）無投機性及非生活必需之貨物，（四）中儲認可之有價證券等，向中儲押借，其期限最多不得超過三個月。</p>
<p>中儲此舉，實為實現國家銀行使命應有之舉。蓋各國之國家銀行因其享有發行紙幣，保管全國準備代理國庫，主持一國清算，調節利率，以及買賣生金銀等特權，故其資力至爲雄厚。每遇市場發生變動，各業迫切需現之時，國家銀行即運用其雄厚之資金，以票　　現或以抵押貸款方式，接濟各私立銀行，間接的以嘉惠於工商業。至於直接與工商界接觸經營普通之存放事，大都巳由各商業銀行任之，各國之國家銀行，殊少有以之爲業務者。</p>
<p>按目前滬市銀根如此緊俏，設長此不予調節，其爲患於金融及國內工商業，殊非淺鮮。蓋一則銀根如續緊，現鈔之需要將愈曾，其結果將便久已絕跡之劃頭貼親事，又復出現於今日，使已歸統一之金融，有再度趨於紊亂之可能。二則各　莊鑒於銀根之日緊，及本身頭寸之缺乏，對於其以前貸予各廠商之款項勢必設法催還，其影響所及，一般從事生產之正當工廠，將因此週轉不靈，各廠將被迫或陷於减工，或陷於停工。長此以往，物資之缺乏，勢必愈　，物價之上漲必愈劇烈，對於國計民生，均將蒙不利之影響。故中儲此次舉辦同業短期拆放，實爲安定金融及救濟工商業之最妥善方法。而一般各大小同業亦可因此次拆放與中儲發生更密切之關　，益促使中儲成爲銀行中之銀行也。</p>

<h3>華源派貨　香烟漲風已定</h3>
<p>香烟市面漲風轉定、蓋一部份盈利人求脫、華源昨派小同行、故人心方面稍呈穩定之態、如大英牌一萬一千八百元、老刀牌一萬〇三百元、品海脾七千七百元五華牌六千八百元、仙女牌七千九百元、日烟金槍牌三千一百五十元、紅玫瑰二千七百五十元、金大樓三千八百元、全六牌三千五百五十元、二十枝三千二百五十元、指南牌二千八百五十元、國烟金字塔六千三百元、美麗牌五千八百五十元、金鼠牌四千二百元、白金龍四千二百元、黄金龍三千二百五十元、均吿軟勢、傳從價稅實行在即、而價恐難回落、</p>

<h3>徵文錄取第三名　我今年約計劃</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>光陰如白駒過隙，中華民國三十一年業已過去，三十二年，行將開始，予之年齡，距花甲一週，僅少一歲矣。回憶過去之五十八年中，始則科舉未廢，朝夕勤讀，冀博功名，結果僅靑一衿，繼則投筆從戎，研究韜略，以求國用，僅曾率隊攻寗，終則來滬謀食，辦理會務，兼寫文稿，忽忽又二十一年矣。中間並時而研習歧黄，時而攻讀法學，時而掌敎學校，一言蔽之，學書學劍，一事無成，慚愧奚似！照我國舊時習俗，年近花甲，可以在家納福，不再做事，奈予雖有三男一女，尙在求學時代，家無遺產，八口之家，全賴予一人筆墨所入以贍麥；即欲休息，亦爲家境所累而不許。幸精神尙健，每日辦公之處，東至江西路，南至龍門路，西至靜安寺路，北至北泥城橋，均徒步而不乘車，毫小覺勞；公餘尙喜東塗西抹以寫稿，今見申報自由談之徵文題目：曰「我今年約計劃」，因是想起予以前所做之事，隨波逐流，未有事前確定之計劃，故如馬浪蕩然，業多而不精，蹉跎歲月，兩鬢已斑，尙無成績可言。現擬乘此將我今年約計劃，規定如下：</p>
<p>（甲）對於社會方面，分下列四點：</p>
<p>（一）任　之各公會，每日規定之辦公時間，應准時趕到，以資表率。</p>
<p>（二）經辦之公文，按照來文之先後，事實之緩急，限定擬稿之次序，暨繕寫與分發之時刻，不得遲誤。</p>
<p>（三）對於慈善事業，雖因處境關係，而無金錢上之幫助，但應抱有錢出錢，有力出力主義，凡有奔跑，宜盡心力而爲之，蓋在此非常時期，上海亟待救濟之難胞，自作孽者固多，受天災人禍而墮落者，恐亦不少，同一圓顏方趾黄帝之子孫，任其凍餒，而熟視無覩，不特民族方面，欲受影響，即撫心自問，亦說不過去，孟子曰：惻隱之心人皆有之。予雖非富有，但衣食尙周，究較他們寬裕，逢人吹噓，筆下宜傳，力所能辦，亦我儕窮措大應做之事，不可放棄。</p>
<p>（四）開會時討論之議案，應平心靜氣，研究事實，不講情面，當贊成者，雖有困難，應解除此困難，俾成立而通過；當否決者，即有請託，應拒絕其請託，俾否決而打銷。</p>
<p>（乙）對於家庭方面，分下列五點：</p>
<p>（一）規定之家用，雖抱量入爲出之主義，但去年因物價之增加，如跑馬然，一往直前，不得不逐月擴大，而所有伙食，價雖漲，貨反少，致小孩因營養不足而息病，所需醫藥發甚鉅，而超出預算，似不値得，故今年對於飲食方面，應力求價格較廉，而與衛生方面，確　有益者，蓋精於選擇，不是蔬菜一　不及魚肉。</p>
<p>（二）衣着方面，因穌寓所在，被刦殆盡，大大小小之衣服，莫不來　後重製，前幾年之衣料與縫工價格，與去年比較，大用歷殊，僉懊悔不早做；而嫌予抱得過且過主　，不肯於前五年價廉時早爲添製之失算，但予以爲此係特殊情形，不足爲訓，今年仍應抱定可省則省，萬不可　其貨價日漲，而多製無用與重複之衣，以免浪費。蓋處此環境，能做到布衣暖一字，已經不易，要退一步想，現在露宿人行道上，無衣無食之難胞，前數年未嘗不有吃山珍海味，穿綾羅綢緞者在內，不嫌衣服敝舊，是大禹與子路之美　，平素尚應服膺其說，而不敢或忘，况處現在之非常時期耶？</p>
<p>（三）兒汝年幼，處於繁華之上海，祇知表面，未悉內容，耳聞目見，易受環境之誘惑，擬將報上所載靑年因意志薄弱，或涉足舞塲，或潛往賭博，因是虧負，而做出不名譽之事：如賭負公款，假報遇盜，與謀斃舞女，竊其首飾等最近新聞，剪貼成帙，供諸案上，俾作小說觀，使之閱後知繁華與萬惡音相似，而有連帶關係，認爲前車之鑒，而如臨深淵，如履薄冰，知所戒懼，不敢嘗試。</p>
<p>（四）兒女雖在大學肄業，對於英算兩門，及各種科學方面，尙知硏究，成績不惡，但對於國學方面，無暇講求，似一缺點，甚至極尋常之典故，竟莫明其意義，而有　解者。故今歲擬乘假期之暇，與渠等講解國學，擇處世必具之常識，與交際口頭所應用者，詳解此典之來源與意義，俾以後不致誤用，而貽笑大方。</p>
<p>（五）我家自明季由滇遷禾，歷代讀書，有二十世聯芳舊語，祖先之蓋言懿行，詳載家譜，爲子孫　應牢記弗忘，而身體力行，自洪楊後，家產蕩然，幸此譜由先祖馴之公保藏，幼時先父理伯公，時擇期講解；八年前，因年久被蛀，曾重行抄錄二册，幷交與近族照抄，此八年內，又有變遷，所有新死亡及新出世諸人之日期，均未塡入，再隔數年，恐難調查，故今歲擬立表，分函族中各房，請詳塡註，以便補人。所有歷代祖先之家訓，擬分別錄出，每逢祭祀時期，令兒輩恭讀勿忘，俾印人其　海。</p>
<p>（　）對於個人方面，分下列四點：</p>
<p>（一）近年來爲衣食所迫，　事太多，辦事方面，難免無疏忽之咎，今年起，擬規定一定辦公時刻，對於應做之事，抱今日應辦者，不再延至明日之主張，謹　實施，以免遺誤。</p>
<p>（二）近因腦力較弱，議人太多，諸友囑辦之事，一轉瞬間，即欲忘却，今年擬特倫一簿，群細記入，如老式商店所懸勤筆免思木牌然，置於案上，逐日翻檢，依次照辦。</p>
<p>（三）溫故知新，不可偏廢，近數年來，事冗無　　書，有出無進，其才欲　，今年起，每日除看報紙　，規定看書一句　，以增學　。</p>
<p>（四）收入有限，交際太多，今年凡有親友送紅白帖來，規定喜事送頌詞小鏡架，喪事即以玉版笺寫誄辭，而不裝被，抱禮輕心意重五字訣。</p>
<p>以上所定計劃大綱，俟實施後，仍逐日記於日記簿上，以備檢查，至年終，再詳核能辦到幾分之幾以自勉。（按孫君年五十九歲，任新藥業公會秘書。）</p>
<h3>普利斯特利　—世界著名科學家的書翰之一</h3>
<p>— Sincoln　Scougte　古心譯</p>
<p>前因　普利斯特利（Joseph　Priestley）是一個不信奉英國國敎的牧帥·科學家·和政客，同時在化學研究和宗敎上，也是一個不安洽的獨持異議者。這位名聞全世的化學家，氧氣，氧化氮，二氧化硫的發見者，時常給他自己將事情弄得很困難，不但爲了他那種沒有正統觀的見解，也爲了他那樣敢於說出他見解的勇敢。</p>
<p>他生於一七三三年，住在百明罕（Birming　ham）。柏克（Edmund　Burke在他的「法國革命回憶錄」中痛斥「恐怖」的時候，普利斯特利就激烈地反對他，因此他被當作法國共和國的公民。一般十九世紀百明罕的衛道者，被他的異說所激怒了，就將他的屋子和敎堂，燒爲平地，他的實騐室也遭到了破壞，圖書室受盡了摧殘，許多善價可沽的無從補償的原稿，也都被毀去了。在這種使人吃驚的野蠻舉動之後，普利斯特利就寫這封信給他那些百明罕的同鄕。</p>
<p>「……我們是綿羊，而你們是狼。」本文　我那從前的同鄕與鄰人，</p>
<p>我已經和你們同住了十一年，在這十一年之中，你們都一致知道我的和平行爲，我只安靜地注意着我職業上的本份，和哲學上的本份，我一些沒有想到，我和我的朋友竟會從你們那裏受到那樣的毀損。但是你們弄錯了。你們聽到了非國敎徒，尤其惟一神的非國敎徒（Uniterian　Dissenters），不息地受人嘲駡，在敎會與國家，都被當作現政府的敵人，因此你們就想，給我的任何毀損都是有功的事情：我沒有得到較好的通知，來不及採取什麼手段。</p>
<p>「目的」正確的時候，你們想「手段」總也是不會錯的。由於你們敎師的言論，你們一般上級人員的呼號，對我發着混亂與咒駡（大家都知道，這些是他們常有的習慣），你們的迷信被激動到最髙的程度，誰也沒有對你們說什麽話，來减輕你們的熱情，凡事只有火上添油，來激發你們的熱情：因此，你們一些也不爲自己想想，不爲他們想想，你們就準備着作出各種暴行來，而他們實在是應該知道一切而敎你們學好的，你們想，你們對我們所作的怨毒與毀損，都是爲了擁護政府，尤其爲了擁護敎會，你們也被領導着想，「毀壞了」我們，「你」對「上帝」和你的國家，就「一定」作了最切實的「服務」。</p>
<p>僥倖，英國人的心理對於「謀殺」是抱着恐懼心的，因此，我希望你們沒有想「這點」。……不過要是用盡方法，想將人生弄得不堪，人生的價値是什麽呢？……</p>
<p>你們已毀壞了哲學工具中最有眞　價　最爲有用的儀器，這些儀器，在這國或任何其他國裏，任何個人都是沒有的，我用牠們的時候，每年費去大量的錢，並沒有一些金錢上的觀念，只是要促進科學，爲了我國與人類的利益，你們也毀壞了一個與那些儀器相關的圖書室，這圖書室裏的書，除了長久的時間以外，是不能用錢來重新買到的。不過我格外痛心的，是你們毀壞了許多「原稿」，這是許多年來努力研究的結果，此後我再也不能夠重新寫出來了；而受到你們這種惡行的人，却是一個對你們從來沒有做過，或想像過任何損害的人。……</p>
<p>如果你想像你的這種行爲，對於你們的動械有什麽效用，或者可以妨害我們的動機，你們就更加錯了。所能夠維持任何宗敎制度的，除了「理智」與「論理」以外，就沒有別的。回答我們的論證，你們的事情就成功了：可是你們却借助於「暴力」，這只證明你們做不出什麼好的事情來。即使你們毀壞我自己，和毀壞我的屋子，圖書室，以及儀器一樣，那末，另外十個這樣有同等精神與能力的人，或更超卓的　，就立刻會興起來。</p>
<p>在這件事情上，我們是綿羊，而你們是狼。我們要保全我們的人格，希望你們也會改變你們的人格。不論怎樣，我們要以德報怨：祈禱你們不久會回到那樣殷勤而淸醒的地步，殷勤與淸醒本來是百明罕居民所藉以出名的。</p>
<p>我是你們忠誠而有良好願望的人。　J普利斯特利</p>
<p>一七九一年七月十九日，在倫敦。</p>
<p>後果　就爲了這次的災禍，普利斯特利就離開百明罕而往倫敦。他在那裏住了三年，然後航海到美洲去。他一到紐約，就受到了熱烈的歡迎。此後，他寫着一本敎會史，在賓夕爾法尼亞（Pennsylvania）的諾森伯蘭（Northumberland），繼續作着化學的實騐，一八〇四年死在那裏。在十八世紀中，英國人爲科學進步作着更多的工作的，爲數很少。（本篇完）</p>
<h3>萬世師表</h3>
<p>— James　Hilton著　依今譯</p>
<p>他們所帶回去的，還有對於一個美妙女子的記念，她曾接待他們，對他們談話，因爲若干年後，在第一次歐戰中，有一次，在勃洛克菲爾德相近的一個大軍營中，有一個小兵來拜訪吉普斯，說，他就是那第一次來比賽足球的隊員之一。吉普斯請他喝茶，並且和他談天，後來，在握手分別的時候，這人說『尊夫人怎樣，先生？我很記得她。』</p>
<p>『眞的嗎？』吉普斯熱烈地答。「你眞的記得她嗎？」</p>
<p>『這還用說麽？我想大家都這樣。』</p>
<p>吉普斯回答說：「他們並不，你知道。至少，這裏不這樣。學生們來而去，一直是新的面孔：記念不會久遠。甚至敎師們也不永遠留着。自從去年—老格里勃爾（Gribble）退職以後，—他是學校裏管膳食的—在這裏的人就沒有一個是看見過我的妻子的。你知道，她在你們來後不到一年就死了。在一八九八年。」</p>
<p>『我聽見這話眞正地難過，先生。我們淘夥裏至少有二三個人是記得她很淸楚的，雖然我們就只有那次見到她。是的，我們記得她，不錯的。』</p>
<p>「我很髙興。…那是我們大家最高興的日子—並且也是一次美好的游戲。』</p>
<p>「我一生中最開心的日子之一。願意過那樣的日子，而不過現在的日子—我就這樣想。明天我就要到法國去了。』</p>
<p>大約一個月之後，吉普斯聽說這個人在巴生台爾（Passchendaele）戰死了。</p>
<p>（七）</p>
<p>現在的情形，正像他生活中溫暖而生動的一段，輻射着一團光輝，在千般的回憶裏熾熱着。學校的鐘聲已變成點名鐘了，威葛特夫人的屋子裏的徽光，在一陣雲霧中給他帶回了那些記憶，—加德鄰沿着石砌的回廓忽忽走着，在他的身旁取笑着他所批改的一篇論文中的某種「大錯」，從莫札特（Mozard）的一支三人合奏曲裏，取出大提琴的部份，以便應用於學校的昔樂會，她那乳脂般的臂膞？在大提琴的褐光上掃着。（十五）社會服務</p>

<h3>On National Diplomacy</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, East Asian countries have entered an unprecedented new era, and the relationship between China and Japan has also entered a closer new stage. Especially after China's entry into the war, the historical mission of the two countries has become even greater. In order to achieve the final victory of the Greater East Asia War, it depends not only on the efforts of the authorities of the two countries, but also on the cooperation and struggle of the people of the two countries. Cooperation in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture requires the cooperation of the people of the two countries in order to achieve real results. Otherwise, no matter how hard the government authorities try, the result will inevitably be a case of getting half the results with twice the effort. The National Diplomacy Promotion Association will be established today, perhaps in view of this. However, if we don't talk about "national diplomacy," then so be it. Otherwise, the following points seem worthy of the attention of those gentlemen who are enthusiastic about "national diplomacy."</p>
<p>First, theoretically speaking, national diplomacy can supplement the inadequacies of government diplomacy. Therefore, in modern progressive countries, great attention has been paid to national diplomacy in peacetime. However, from the perspective of the relationship between China and Japan, there has been no so-called "national diplomacy" in the past. Since the launch of the peace movement, there has also been no genuine national diplomacy. Especially today, after China declared its participation in the war, close cooperation between the two governments is no longer a problem. Therefore, the main task of today's "national diplomacy" is naturally not to supplement the inadequacies of government diplomacy, but to adapt to this new situation in light of the current close relationship between the two countries, so that the mutual understanding and cooperation between the people of the two countries become even more important. Therefore, the focus of today's national diplomacy should be on enhancing the thorough understanding and cooperation between the people of China and Japan.</p>
<p>Second, in the past sixty years, due to the instigation of discord by Britain and the United States, suspicion and hatred have been created between China and Japan. Especially since the Sino-Japanese Incident, there has been an undercurrent of suspicion, and even hatred, in the minds of the people of the two countries, which cannot be denied. After years of efforts by the authorities of the two countries to advocate peace and then conclude an alliance, it seems that there can be some gradual changes in the minds of the people, from suspicion to understanding. However, in any case, this will inevitably require a considerable amount of time and the efforts of both the government and the public. However, to be honest, in the past, the words of friendship between friendly countries exceeded the facts of friendship. Therefore, people do not feel any value when they hear words of friendship. Therefore, if there is to be national diplomacy in the future, it must assist the authorities to change the past phenomenon, and it is especially hoped that the facts of friendship between friendly countries will exceed the words of friendship in order to achieve results.</p>
<p>Third, the authorities of the two countries are now advocating national diplomacy, which is the prelude to attaching importance to public opinion. In wartime, the only thing that national diplomacy can achieve is to harmonize emotions, and this alone is enough to be the starting point for the century-long cooperation between the people of the two countries. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities of the two countries will pay serious attention to this point and inform the people with more facts of friendship. For example, the food problem must be resolved reasonably and quickly to reduce the suffering of the people. As long as the sincerity of cooperation between China and Japan is demonstrated more in practice, the emotions between the people of the two countries can be truly harmonized, and only with the sincere harmony between the people of the two countries can the cooperation between the two countries be truly effective. It is hoped that those who advocate national diplomacy will not ignore this point.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that "national diplomacy" will not become an empty slogan or slogan, but that we will do some practical things. In particular, it is hoped that the people of the two countries must be treated equally. We must know that the failure of the ethnic policies of Britain and the United States in the past was because they regarded themselves as superior races and regarded the inferior races in the colonies as our East Asian people, so they only aroused the resistance of the East Asian nations. Among our Eastern nations, especially between China and Japan, we need to set an example, reverse what Britain and the United States have done, and fully realize the ideal of "ethnic equality." Whether in China or Japan, whether to overseas Chinese or to the Chinese people in other occupied areas, we must fully express the spirit of equality, friendship, and love. Only in this way can we thoroughly change the past phenomena, and all of these are what those who speak of "national diplomacy" today urgently need to strive for.</p>

<h3>Mei Siping Talks About Mobilizing Materials But Not Manpower</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 19th, Haitong News Agency – Minister of Industry Mei Siping, in an interview with a reporter from Haitong News Agency, stated that the National Government hopes that after the restoration of normal conditions, in addition to supplying Japan with materials, it will also supply the Axis countries in Europe. The National Government does not mobilize manpower for immediate combat, but only increases raw materials and industrial production. The mobilization of materials in China is proceeding smoothly. The full utilization of Chinese factories depends on the solution of transportation problems. China produced 20,000,000 (the number is unclear) bales of cotton annually before the outbreak of the war. At present, the price of cotton should be increased to encourage production. The British and American sides stated that Chongqing purchased materials from the peaceful areas. Foreign observers do not seem to understand this very well. We should remember that the demarcation between the peaceful and non-peaceful areas of China is not like the battle line between the occupied and non-occupied areas of the Soviet Union. Materials can still circulate, and the peaceful areas can also obtain items such as antimony and tung oil.</p>
<h3>Finance Minister Zhou Issues a Statement The Government Is Making Appropriate Financial Preparations</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 19th, Haitong News Agency – Zhou Fohai, China's Minister of Finance and concurrently President of the Central Reserve Bank, received Tremtall, a reporter from Haitong News Agency, and stated that the National Government still adheres to the policy of maintaining the original face value of the Central Reserve Bank notes in order to complete the plan to stabilize prices. The government is now making appropriate financial preparations to meet the needs of Chinese industrialists during wartime and will enable Chinese manufacturers to obtain sufficient raw materials for their use. Therefore, the commencement of factories can be realized as much as possible. In addition, setting reasonable prices for goods will also encourage industrialists to engage in production. The government also pays special attention to the issue of China's agricultural output in order to enhance its combat potential. Regarding the issue of implementing special taxes to enrich war funds, Zhou replied that the government has not yet considered this for the time being, but the general tax and income tax will be increased. The government has not yet considered issuing war bonds.</p>
<h3>Deputy Minister Guo Broadcast Last Night</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 19th, Central News Agency – Guo Xiufeng, Deputy Minister of Propaganda, delivered a radio address to the nation on January 19th, titled "Peace and Participation in the War," the gist of which was: Peace requires struggle, and war is the highest form of struggle. We want to achieve peace, defend East Asia, and participate in the war. Unless the Greater East Asia War is completed and the Anglo-American forces of aggression are eliminated, comprehensive peace between China and Japan cannot be achieved, and East Asia cannot be liberated. Participation in the war is the development of the peace movement. Peace and participation in the war are consistent. The instructions left to us by the Founding Father on his deathbed were: "Peace, Struggle, Save China." We must fundamentally eliminate the past erroneous concept of recognizing peace as complacency and raise the spirit of struggle, embark on the road of war, and do our best and shed our blood to realize peace between China and Japan, peace in East Asia, and world peace. In the midst of this evolution of the old and new eras, we can only fight until the final victory.</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles on the Entire Eastern Front for the Capture of Important Strongholds The Soviet Union Sends Newly Formed Reserve Troops to Break Through the Siege of Leningrad</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 19th, Central News Agency – The battles south of Lake Ladoga in the northern region of the Eastern Front are becoming increasingly fierce. In order to break through the siege of Leningrad, the Soviets are using newly formed reserve troops under Marshal Voroshilov, launching fierce attacks on German positions from three directions: west of Shlisselburg on the west bank of the Neva River and south of Lake Ladoga. German war bulletins also report that the German army is engaged in fierce defensive battles in that area, and that 229 enemy tanks have been destroyed in that area alone since the 12th, which is a testament to the fierce fighting in that area. At the same time, a telegram from Moscow on the 18th reported that the Soviet army, despite fierce German resistance, had occupied Shlisselburg, but there was no confirmation. The Soviet army also appears to have attacked repeatedly in the middle and upper reaches of the Don River. Soviet troops advancing southwest from Voronezh, ignoring fierce German resistance, are slowly advancing towards Kupiansk. According to a telegram from Moscow, other Soviet troops advancing south along the Voronezh-Rostov railway on the 18th recaptured Kamensk-Shakhtinsky and several villages in its vicinity. However, the activity of the Axis air force in that area is quite intense, and the Soviet army has suffered heavy losses. There are also fierce offensive and defensive battles in northern and central Caucasus. With the exception of important positions on the war roads, German troops in some areas appear to have withdrawn to new positions in the rear. A Soviet war bulletin said that the Soviet army had finally crossed the Manych River.</p>
<p>Pressure Increases in the Don River Region German Defensive Tactics Inflict Heavy Losses on the Enemy</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th, Haitong News Agency – Although the Soviet army continues to attack with a large army in the Lake Ladoga region, there is no doubt that it will use reserve troops to reinforce the offensive launched in the southern route two months ago. In the past few days, the war on the southern route of the Eastern Front has become increasingly fierce, and the pressure on the Soviet army in the Don River region has increased. However, the enemy's offensive has been repelled by the German and Allied forces. The German army's elastic defensive tactics have inflicted heavy losses on the enemy. In the past two months, the Soviet army has reported the loss of 6,000 tanks, most of which were lost on the southern route of the Eastern Front. In northern Caucasus, the Soviet army continues to attack fiercely. The German army besieged in Stalingrad is resisting the Soviet army fiercely. The German army's resistance in that area is very successful. There are only local wars on the central route of the Eastern Front. In the mop-up operations behind the front line, the German army annihilated 2,000 enemy troops.</p>
<p>German Headquarters, 19th, Haitong News Agency – This afternoon's German war report stated that German troops repelled enemy troops invading western Caucasus. Fierce fighting continues in northern Caucasus and the Don River region. Yesterday and the day before yesterday, 62 Soviet tanks were destroyed. In the Stalingrad area, enemy troops repeatedly invaded with fresh troops, and our army fought bravely. Southeast of Lake Ilmen and enemy troops in the central route did not succeed in their offensive. South of Lake Ladoga, the Soviet army attacked under the cover of heavy artillery, and the battle was extremely fierce. The enemy suffered heavy losses and retreated. In the above two war zones, 32 Soviet tanks were destroyed. Soviet aircraft engaged in air battles with the Axis air force, and 16 were shot down. German and Italian aircraft returned to their original defenses safely.</p>
<p>Snow Melting in the Caucasus Soviet Offensive Making Little Progress</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th, Haitong News Agency – The battle for important strongholds on the Eastern Front continued fiercely on Sunday. The German army's mobile defensive tactics have been successful everywhere. The snow in western Caucasus has begun to melt, and the Soviet army's offensive has not made any progress. The war in the Terek region of northern Caucasus is still in progress. The Soviet army's attacks on various points in Stalingrad did not succeed. In the area between the Volga and the Don rivers, the German army repelled enemy troops attacking north on the Kalmyk Plain. The Soviet army's offensive on the south bank of the Don River was also repelled. The offensive in the Don River loop is not as fierce as before. The German army destroyed 15 enemy tanks during the offensive and recovered many strongholds. The Soviet army's offensive in the central region of the Pakhra River was very fierce on Sunday, but it was eventually repelled. The war southeast of Lake Ilmen has subsided, and the Soviet army has been driven back by the German army's counterattack.</p>
<h3>German Army Plants New-Type Mines in Libya British Tank Corps Suffers Heavy Losses No Changes on the Tunisian Front</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th, Domei News Agency – Front-line news: The British Eighth Army launched a large-scale offensive in North Africa on the 15th of this month. By yesterday, the third day, it had lost another 20 tanks. In the previous two days, it had lost about 100 tanks. Although the British army's offensive is large-scale, the positions of the German-Italian Allied forces have not changed. The British army is advancing along the coastal road with a strong infantry force covered by tanks, and is concentrating the main force of the tank corps to attack the south side of the German army. However, this offensive has failed.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th, Haitong News Agency – It is declared here that German engineers have recently used a new type of mine in North Africa, the structure of which can reduce the reaction that allows the British army to discover them during searches, and after being buried underground, it is extremely difficult to dig them up. According to military sources, when Montgomery attacked General Rommel's southern flank this time, his tanks suffered heavy losses in front of this new type of mine.</p>
<p>German Rearguard Force Vigorously Blocks the British Army</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 19th, Haitong News Agency – According to news from London, well-informed British sources warned the British press not to be optimistic about the situation in Libya. General Montgomery's troops will still find it difficult to occupy Tripoli. The British vanguard was blocked by the German rearguard force in Zliten. The main force of the German-Italian Allied forces is already 160 kilometers west of Zliten. The British army is advancing in three routes: the first route is advancing along the coastal highway towards Misrata, having reached Tawurgha; the second route has reached Dafna; the third route has reached Urid. London believes that General Rommel does not want to defend Tripolitania firmly, but wants to go to Tunisia.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 18th, Havas News Agency – According to news from the British and American sides, there have been no major changes on the Tunisian front recently. The Allied Headquarters' war report only stated that there were no major changes in the front-line war yesterday, and that it was not very active in the air due to bad weather. However, British and American aircraft bombed Axis transportation hubs near Gabès and the ports of Sfax and Sousse. French separatist troops have occupied new positions near Bou Arada and Pichon, wanting to replace the American troops in the area. Axis aircraft are also busy bombing Allied shipping and transportation lines in Algeria and the port of Bône. As for Libya, it is heard that, according to Rommel, the British Eighth Army plans to abandon the plan to attack Misrata and attack Beni Ulid to the east, and it is said that it can continue to advance in the desert area, thereby avoiding the mountainous positions held by the Axis forces.</p>
<p>British and Americans Attempt to Protect Maritime Transportation</p>
<p>Madrid, 19th, Haitong News Agency – A military correspondent for the Spanish "Luna" newspaper stated that the goal of the British and American operations in North Africa seems to be to recover the positions occupied by the Axis forces on the Tunisian coast and the Strait of Sicily in order to restore the sea route between Gibraltar and Alexandria. If the Allies want to maintain transportation in the Mediterranean, it is necessary to occupy Tunisia and Tripolitania. Europe and Africa are only a short distance apart, but this area is already under the control of the Axis forces. Therefore, the war in Africa is not a war for colonies, but a part of the European war. The Axis forces have already occupied a superior position in North Africa because their transportation lines are extremely short, while the British and American transportation lines are very far away and are threatened by the Axis naval and air forces along the way. Therefore, the urgent task for the Allies is to organize supply plans and unified command. The past chaotic and independent military actions of the Allies have created opportunities for the Axis forces to establish bases, and the Axis forces' air superiority has enabled the Axis forces to land in Tunisia.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Su Strenuously Argues: Food Shortage</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Havas) - Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Litvinov, recently issued a call on American radio, strenuously arguing that Soviet food supplies are extremely scarce.

Finally, he requested that Britain and the United States send ships to transport food to assist the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Turkey to Face Severe Crisis</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 18th (Havas) - A Turkish newspaper published an article today by a well-known military commentator, warning the people that Turkey will encounter a severe crisis this year, unprecedented since the outbreak of the current European war.

<p>Berlin, 19th (Haitong Agency) - The Haitong Agency reported last night on the details of the German air raid on London for the second time on Sunday night, stating that the first batch of German bombers broke into central London at around 8:00 PM that evening. Within fifteen minutes, the German aircraft dropped a large number of bombs and incendiary devices. Major fires broke out in many parts of the western and southwestern Thames Estuary. Although the anti-aircraft fire in the urban and suburban areas of London was very intense, it was insufficient to hinder the German aircraft's attacks. The fires that broke out in the London docklands area continued to burn until 3:00 AM the next morning. At that time, the second batch of German bombers arrived in London, and this air raid lasted for ninety minutes. The weather was clear that day, so the visibility for the German aircraft was extremely clear.

<p>Berlin, 19th (Haitong Agency) - When British aircraft raided northern Germany on Sunday night, twenty-five were shot down, twenty of which were shot down over Berlin, and the other five were shot down en route to Berlin. After the German aircraft received an alert that British aircraft were coming from the north, they immediately took off to engage them. At around 10:00 PM that evening, enemy aircraft approached Berlin, and the German anti-aircraft batteries opened fire, preventing enemy aircraft from flying into Berlin from the southeast. Only a small number of British aircraft infiltrated the skies over Berlin to drop bombs. At this time, the enemy aircraft began to encounter a bad fate. Several British bombers had already been shot down on the way to Berlin. Only a few of the enemy aircraft participating in the raid managed to fly back to Britain. Most of the downed enemy aircraft were four-engine bombers, and only a few crew members were rescued. The damage caused by the British aircraft was very minor.</p>

<h3>Two Japanese Youth Organizations Plan to Merge</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - Japanese youth leadership authorities, in order to merge the "Greater Japan Youth Corps" with national school service corps to organize a "New Greater Japan Youth Corps," previously organized a special committee to plan the reorganization. To date, the specific measures have been completely decided and will be submitted to the government for approval in early next month. In the past, Japanese youth organizations were divided into two: one was the "Greater Japan Youth Corps," which mainly served working youths engaged in increasing production; the other was the school service corps, which mainly consisted of students from universities, higher schools, specialized schools, middle schools, and other levels. This time, in order to unify the organization, it is planned to reorganize. According to the new organizational measures, members of school service corps at all levels will also be members of the New Greater Japan Youth Corps. The state will train, guide, and supervise this unified organization. For the sake of effectiveness, it has been decided to set up inspection officials in various regions.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong's Construction Policy for This Year: Governor Isogai's Remarks</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, 19th (Central News Agency) - When Governor Isogai of Hong Kong met with a group of reporters yesterday, he made the following remarks regarding the main policy for constructing Hong Kong this year: The plan to build sailing ships to adapt to wartime production is progressing smoothly. The first ship has now been completed and launched. In the future, we will strive to move towards the predetermined goals for the first year. The Governor's Office's policy strives for self-sufficiency in materials and labor. Although we are currently focusing all efforts on manufacturing ships for the Hong Kong Governor's Office itself, we intend to undertake the construction of those needed in various southern regions. Hong Kong's shipbuilding industry will make more progress in terms of speed in the future. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, remittances from overseas Chinese had once stopped, but have now resumed from overseas Chinese in areas occupied by the Japanese army. As a relay port for the exchange of goods, trade is becoming increasingly prosperous, so we hope that this financial circulation will gradually become smoother. Regarding the integration of Chinese banks, we have not yet reached this stage. This year, Hong Kong has become a relay port for the exchange of goods. In order to prepare its infrastructure, we are rapidly organizing warehouses under military administration and adjusting and improving warehouse facilities so that we can make the most of Hong Kong's excellent harbor facilities and warehouses. Regarding the evacuation of the population, the predetermined goal for last year was 300,000 people, which has largely been completed. This year, we are considering continuing to evacuate 300,000 people. The current population of Hong Kong is about 1.2 million. If 300,000 people are evacuated in two years, it can be reduced to 700,000. These 700,000 people will be sufficient to undertake the mission of developing Hong Kong's commerce and industry or acting as a relay port in the future.</p>

<h3>Lehigh University Graduation Ceremony: Grew Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Reuter) - Former US Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Grew, delivered a speech at the graduation ceremony of Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, yesterday, stating briefly, "Japan is the strongest of the world's latent powers. If it is allowed to permanently occupy its current territories, then the country's attempt to seize US territory closer to it is only a matter of time. I have not exaggerated my words. All kinds of major raw materials that can develop its national power are now under its control."</p>
<h3>US Democratic Party Executive Committee: Walker Appointed Chairman</h3>
<p>Swiss Capital, 18th (Havas) - According to news from Washington, Mr. Flynn, the newly appointed US President Roosevelt's special envoy to Australia and US Minister, submitted his resignation today as Chairman of the Democratic Party National Executive Committee. The Executive Committee immediately re-elected Mr. Walker as Chairman until the start of the next presidential election.

<h3>Bolivia: Miners' Riot</h3>
<p>Argentine Capital, 19th (Haitong News Agency) - According to reports from La Paz, Bolivia, bloody riots occurred in Bolivia last month. Bolivian Interior Minister Chirvante only recently revealed this. It is said that on December 13, 1942, miners in the Catavi district, incited by the Revolutionary Committee, staged a strike. The government immediately declared a state of emergency in the area. On December 18, a large crowd of people, mostly striking workers and their wives and daughters, marched to the Catavi district. The military commander of the area, in order to avoid bloodshed, ordered the payment of overdue wages. On December 21, striking workers attacked the barracks, and soldiers were forced to open fire, killing four workers and wounding nineteen. After the workers received reinforcements, about 500 people attacked the train and damaged high-voltage power lines, shouting the slogan "Down with British and American imperialism." Chirvante continued, "This riot was an action of the Fifth Column." Opposition to democratic politics has always been a task of interest to the people of the Axis countries.</p>
<h3>Must Britain Abandon India? (Part 1) - Transferred from Macau on January 11</h3>
<p>The American Saturday Evening Post published this India dispatch telegraphed from Bombay by Edgar Snow on September 12. The content is more concrete, and the material is quite extensive. It is translated here for reference. -Translator-</p>
<p>At present, in India, due to the increasingly close approach of two big pliers, (Germany is attacking the last bean-sized obstacle in the northwest, attempting to participate in Asia, while Japan is preparing to attack Bengal from the east.)</p>
<p>Especially because the Indian National Congress has opposed Britain's domestic struggle, India can no longer play merely a static role in world politics. India's non-violence is creating dynamic history.</p>
<p>The British answer to Gandhi's request to "Leave India!" was to arrest the leaders of the Indian National Congress, resulting in widespread disturbances and bloodshed, which are worse than any recent group conflicts in India. Therefore, the world's attention has to focus on this major political problem in the democratic camp.</p>
<p>Before the Bombay Conference of the National Congress resolved the "Leave India!" proposal, and before Britain planned to deal with the movement of disobedience with oppression, the place most able to feel the pulse of Indian nationalism was a small city called Wardha. The city is located in the middle of India's central provinces, at the intersection of two major railway lines, with a population of about 30,000 people.</p>
<p>Wardha is important not because it has anything particularly attractive. The temperature here is always around 120 degrees, and many people die of heat every year. The water is muddy, and when I visited the city, there was cholera, and many residents suffered from malaria. The land is mostly sandy, and the scenery is ordinary and monotonous.</p>
<p>After suffering in a primitive carriage called a "tonga," pulled by an old and emaciated horse, you can see dirty villages full of cacti. The villages look like something between a small farm and a refugee center. Walking in from the muddy path, you arrive at a straw hut that looks like other houses. The house is made of mud, covered with a little palm leaf as a roof. A wooden fence surrounds the outside of the house, and a "Charkha" (spinning wheel) is crudely sculpted on the mud wall. Gloomy cattle wander nearby—Indian cattle and camels have very bad tempers—and scrawny chickens strut in the yard. An old man sits barefoot on a mat floor, his body beautifully wrapped in several yards of coarse cloth. He is toothless, with an unexpectedly strong and broad chest covered with gray-white hair. There is a spinning wheel between his gaunt knees.</p>
<p>You probably already guessed that this old man is Mahatma Gandhi. And in the house where scorpions and snakes gather, among the chickens and cattle, there gathers a strange and kind staff and laborers who practice Gandhi's teachings. This is where Britain's main troubles lie, and this is what gives Churchill a headache. Here, Gandhi writes articles for "Harijan Weekly," the most influential political publication in India. As a journalist, Gandhi is like a mixture of Dorothy Thompson and Dorothy Dix (translator's note: two famous American female journalists). His claims on every issue are just as strong as those of the ladies. From admonishing young ladies on how their personal conduct should be, to recommending ways for Churchill to conduct the war, he discusses everything. If Americans followed the Dorothys as devoutly as Indians follow Gandhi, the world would be a different place.</p>
<p>Although, in fact, this chocolate-colored Mickey Mouse, (a nickname given to him by his longtime follower Mrs. Naidu,) is still the most important person in the world for India. If you don't understand Gandhi, if you don't meet him, you can't understand the actions of the Indian National Congress.</p>
<p>Before visiting Gandhi, I traveled from one end of India to the other. I attended a meeting of the All India National Congress in Allahabad and spent a lot of time there talking with leading figures and nationalists. After that, I traveled to Calcutta, Delhi, Bombay, and other places. In order to find opinions on political issues, I visited anti-war socialists, pro-war communists, student leaders, pro-Axis people like Subhas Bose, Muslims who sided with Jinnah, and important figures and industrialists.</p>
<p>However, there always seemed to be a lack of common opinion, and it was difficult to find a focus among these people. It was strange, and it finally convinced me that I had to visit Gandhi immediately, whom I had not seen for ten years. It was the Governor-General of India himself who said, "Without Gandhi, there is no National Congress. In the past, the National Congress was his organization, and it still is. Until he dies, the National Congress will always be his. The axis of the National Congress is Gandhi's political genius." This is indeed the case. As for saying that the National Congress is Indian nationalism, the Governor-General would not admit it—more on this later.</p>
<p>Gandhi's remarks rarely have pre-prepared answers. It is clear that he must think that others are good at the terms of materialistic politics. The content of his declarations is extremely ambiguous, which makes him seem like a political clown at worst, and at best self-contradictory. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>A few months ago, Gandhi declared that India could never become independent unless an agreement was reached between the National Congress and the Muslim League. But now, he accuses the Indian Communist Party of insisting on the unity of the National Congress and the Muslim League, saying that it is wrong, saying that independence comes first, and unity will follow.</p>
<p>When he recently launched another "final struggle" to fight for complete independence, he said that this movement was extremely beneficial to the British. His proposal was "expressed in the most amicable spirit." Gandhi said, "Anti-British? Who is anti-British? Me? No, no, I am pro-British from head to toe."</p>
<h3>Dutch Parliament Convenes</h3>
<p>Finnish Capital, 19th (Haitong News Agency) - The Finnish Parliament convened its first meeting after Christmas yesterday to discuss budgetary issues. The Finnish newspaper indicated that there would be changes in the cabinet. The Minister of Social Welfare, Mr. Fagerholm, was said to have resigned last year.</p>
<h3>After China's Entry into the War: A New Understanding of Sino-Japanese Cooperation</h3>
<p>— By Kaheita Okazaki, Councillor of the Greater East Asia Ministry</p>
<p>Translated from the January 12th Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun</p>
<p>The author of this article, Mr. Okazaki, is from Okayama Prefecture, Japan. He graduated from the Department of Political Science, Faculty of Law, Tokyo Imperial University in the second year of the Taisho era (1913). He then joined the Bank of Japan. After the outbreak of the China Incident, he was appointed as the head of the Foreign Exchange Division of the bank in November of the twelfth year of the Showa era (1937). In the fourteenth year of Showa, he joined the China Development Bank as a director. The bank was the only Japanese-cooperative issuing bank in Central China at that time. Since then, he has been dedicated to the settlement of foreign trade in Central China and has studied the finances of the Shanghai International Settlement. With the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry, he joined the ministry as a councillor, a position he holds to this day.</p>
<p>The National Government's participation in the war is an inevitable conclusion after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. For the anti-Japanese regime, seduced by the demons of the United States and Britain, and destroying its foothold in East Asia, this should provide a final opportunity for introspection. At the same time, it clearly indicates the path that the Chinese people should take. Sino-Japanese cooperation will also be extremely demanded as a result. The basic concepts and methods of economic cooperation and other aspects of collaboration will also be renewed and consolidated.</p>
<p>The abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of concessions were probably the basic diplomatic policies that Japan had already adopted before the National Government returned to its capital. With the return of the National Government to its capital, preparations are gradually being made for its concretization, and today it has taken the first step towards implementation. Japan has had many years of hard-fought experience in abolishing extraterritoriality since the Meiji Restoration. Therefore, the Japanese government and people, with "Taoism" as the diplomatic keynote, often sympathize with the position of neighboring countries. As long as a government that can cooperate with Japan and is trustworthy appears in China, it will surely take the lead in implementing this matter. This kind of idea has long existed and is a matter of course. I understand the true intentions of the Chinese and Japanese governments and people, so I sincerely hope that Chinese officials and people can support each other and work hard to build a new China, and wholeheartedly assist Japan's current national destiny to build a new East Asia and reject the great cause of American and British aggression in East Asia.</p>
<p>The revitalized China led by Chairman Wang should be able to show itself as a truly independent country. However, it has not been long since the National Government returned to its capital, and the people's love for it is not yet very strong. Moreover, while the Greater East Asia War is still in full swing, it is not easy to strengthen the government's strength and improve its organization. In addition, among the Chinese people, there are still many who are confused by American and British propaganda, and who are still hesitant and ambivalent. Therefore, I think it is not easy to expect them to have a unified national spirit immediately. In fact, the relationship between the Chinese government and the people is undoubtedly very different from that of Japan. For thousands of years, the idea of "revering those who cherish us and resisting those who abuse us" still lurks in various places. Therefore, it is necessary to thoroughly understand such political affairs, national character, and the current stage of the Chinese national economic organization. In the future, Japan must use practical methods that are in line with it and provide it with full assistance. Furthermore, Chinese officials and people must open their minds and seek advice and assistance from Japan at any time in order to move towards the path of enriching and perfecting their national organization.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the friendly cooperation between the two countries must be seen in both material and spiritual aspects. However, in the economic aspect, the tasks undertaken by the people of both countries are even more numerous. Since the people of both countries have been active within the scope of concessions and extraterritorial rights for many years, it will not be easy for them to adapt to the new situation for the time being. For the Chinese, the extraterritorial rights of concessions and foreigners can be said to be a safe zone for their lives and property in many ways, so it is understandable that they now feel a bit chilly. Therefore, the officials of both countries must give more consideration to this point and do their best to protect the people.</p>
<p>However, for the Chinese people, the most important thing is a correct understanding of the new situation. In other words, people of both countries must thoroughly understand the content of this world-wide reform, which should probably not be seen in history, and the significance of the Greater East Asia War unfolding before their eyes, and thus change their past minds. It must be known that old-fashioned minds will sooner or later be unable to adapt to the times, and the giant wheel of history will never turn back. It has long since raised its rumbling sound and is moving forward. If you keep this sound in your heart and listen carefully, you will unexpectedly understand that the new Sino-Japanese relationship starting from now has deep historical roots, and then a new understanding will naturally arise. This is a certain truth.</p>
<p>Regarding the various issues that will unfold under the new Sino-Japanese relationship, we now have various expectations and hopes for them. Now, let's take one of the biggest issues, namely economic cooperation, for example. In the future, Sino-Japanese joint ventures will continue to expand, and this must be the case. Because people from both countries work together and their interests are intertwined, the connection between the two countries will be firm. However, in this regard, the methods used by the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands as their colonial policies in East Asia, that is, cleverly suppressing China's own industry and preventing it from developing, so that China will forever be reduced to their commodity market, we will never follow suit. I think that people of both countries should reject this kind of American and British exploitation. Whether it is industry or agriculture, those who have been resisted and have not been developed, so that they are insufficient today, then whether it is technology, machinery, business operators, or capital, China should seek them from Japan. Japan should also provide them quickly as requested, complementing each other's strengths and making up for each other's weaknesses, in order to make the economies of the two countries one and strengthen the economic power of East Asia. This is actually the substantial foundation of Sun Yat-sen's ideal of Pan-Asianism, and at the same time, it is to express the significance of this National Government's participation in the war and the new situation that follows, and it is also to conform to the requirements of history.

<h3>Strictly Searching for Smuggled Grain / Unified Purchase in the Interior / Restricting the Inflow of Urban Funds into Grain-Producing Areas / The Food Department Plans to Adjust Supply in Shanghai</h3>
<p>In order to control the work of purchasing food, the newly established Food Department plans to restrict the inflow of funds from various cities into food production areas. The result is worthy of attention. The Food Department's plan is intended to prevent the activities of unscrupulous merchants. If this measure is implemented, then food will not be purchased with cash. In this way, the expansion of currency in the interior can also be prevented.</p>
<p>Purchase from Production Areas / Food Rice Enters the Market</p>
<p>It is reported that the Food Department plans to purchase food rice from various production areas to adjust the supply of food rice in the Shanghai area. Taking Wuhu production area as an example, the local rice shops have a storage volume of only 100,000 shi. The Anhui South Office of the Food Department decided to purchase 60,000 shi from this survey (the purchase price is 266 yuan for the top grade and 262 yuan for the second grade), and the remaining 40,000 shi will be reserved for local people's food. However, because there is no restriction on retail prices, rice prices are becoming more and more expensive. As of the 14th, the price of top-grade rice in the area was 380 yuan per shi and the second grade was 320 yuan.</p>
<p>Relaxing Restrictions on the Movement of Materials</p>
<p>Well-informed sources said that although the prices of various goods in the interior are managed by the Local Price Countermeasures Committee and the Price Management Bureau, the lack of horizontal links between the local price management agencies has resulted in a situation where local prices are becoming more and more divergent. Taking Wuxi and Hangzhou as examples, the average price in the latter is twice as expensive as the former. Some say that the difference in prices between the two places is due to the different amounts of inventory. Officials believe that if they want to adjust this, they must relax the restrictions on the movement of materials in the peaceful area. Otherwise, although Wuxi has a large amount of inventory, merchants will definitely be unwilling to sell their inventory because the price of goods in Hangzhou is so high. Its impact will also make the listing of materials in Wuxi less flexible.</p>
<p>Strict Prohibition of Concealed Private Sales</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was learned from relevant parties that, in order to completely eliminate private sales and stabilize people's hearts, the authorities must conduct strict searches on anyone carrying bulky packages and trying to cross important areas. If any grain or its products are found to be concealed, the goods will be confiscated. In the four suburbs of Shanghai, such as Pudong, Jiangwan, Qibao, Hongqiao, and Xuhui, there are still illegal miscellaneous grain and rice shops that raise the prices of national rice and sell it to rice dealers, who smuggle it into the country, which hinders the entire controlled grain administration. Therefore, with the consent of the local authorities, it is absolutely forbidden for grain and rice shops to illegally sell rice and grain, and they have been banned from operating from the previous day in order to control them.</p>
<p>Bureau Rice Sacks Should Still Be Returned</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau's Intelligence Department announced that regarding the matter of purchasing sacks, the Bureau has already announced it in Announcement No. 6237 on the 18th of this month. It is now found that the so-called purchase does not refer to the sacks used by the Bureau to deliver rice to various food stores, wineries, restaurants, factories, and other large supply groups. These sacks should still be returned to the Bureau's Sack Storage Office at 104 North Suzhou Road for verification.</p>
<h3>Nightclubs in Western Shanghai Sponsor Winter Relief</h3>
<p>The municipal government is raising 2 million yuan to fund winter relief expenses. Nightclubs in western Shanghai support this move. Initiated by Keiberm, the owner of Aiqinting (Eve's Paradise), 10% of the total income will be taken out from January 20th for one week to fund winter relief expenses.</p>
<h3>Edible Oil to Be Sold in Bulk Before the Lunar New Year / Soybeans Have Been Ordered</h3>
<p>The system of rationing edible oil based on population in this city has been discussed in detail by the Shanghai Edible Oil Wholesale Office for several times, and detailed measures will be ready soon. However, before it is implemented, the Wholesale Office, in view of the urgent needs of residents during the Lunar New Year, will sell edible oil in two phases from the 21st of this month in accordance with previous methods. It is said that it can be continuously supplied for eight days.</p>
<p>The Tongmeng News Agency reported from this port last night that the Japanese authorities recently allocated 6,000 tons of raw materials for oil production. Various oil factories in this port have processed and extracted oil. In addition, 10,000 tons of soybeans have been ordered in Manchuria, Jinan, Hankou and other places. Once they arrive in Shanghai, they can be allocated to oil factories. Therefore, the black market oil prices in Mupu (Shanghai) fell sharply yesterday. Soybean oil and rapeseed oil had risen to 2,500 yuan per shi, but have now fallen to 1,500 yuan. If the distribution is even in the future, it is expected that the black market will decline further.</p>
<h3>City Party Affairs Conference Concludes / Telegrams Sent to Allied Nations / Declaration and Telegram to Compatriots in Chongqing Published</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters of the Chinese Kuomintang (Nationalist Party) concluded its city-wide party affairs conference on the 18th. In addition to sending a telegram to the Chairman to pay tribute, the conference also sent telegrams to the people of the Allied nations of Japan and Italy, and a telegram to the compatriots in Chongqing.</p>
<h3>Demolition of Houses Prohibited Again in the Urban Area</h3>
<p>Recently, the source of timber has been unsmooth, causing prices to soar. A small number of citizens often demolish houses for sale in order to make huge profits. However, everyone knows that this move is enough to hinder the revitalization of the urban area. In the past, the municipal authorities have strictly prohibited this. However, it has been found that after a long time, the wind of demolishing houses in the urban area has risen again. The Municipal Police Headquarters and the Public Works Bureau will jointly issue a notice to prohibit it. Those who dare to deliberately violate it will be punished according to the law.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to China Shigemitsu Aoi Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday / Discussing Official Affairs with Japanese Authorities in Shanghai / Chief of Intelligence Department Tomioka Arrived Here on Monday</h3>
<p>Tongmeng News Agency reports from this port that, according to a report last night, Ambassador Shigemitsu Aoi arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday (Tuesday) afternoon to discuss official affairs with the Japanese authorities in Shanghai. This is the first time Shigemitsu has come to Shanghai since China's entry into the war on the 9th. In addition, Tomioka, the Consul General in Nanjing and Chief of the Intelligence Department of the Embassy in China, also arrived in Shanghai on Monday afternoon.</p>
<h3>National Diplomacy Promotion Association to Hold Inaugural Meeting Today / Minister Chu and Ambassador Shigemitsu to Attend and Give Speeches</h3>
<p>People in Shanghai recently launched the National Diplomacy Promotion Association from the standpoint of the people because the National Government officially announced its participation in the Greater East Asia War and signed agreements with Allied countries on the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality. The purpose is to enhance friendship with people from Allied countries and promote China's international status, so as to jointly complete the construction of the new order in Greater East Asia. A preparatory meeting was held at noon yesterday on the 14th floor of the International Hotel. Wen Lanting, Yuan Fudeng, Lin Kanghou, Wu Kaisheng, Zhao Jinqing, Zhao Zhengping, Chen Binhe, Pan Dai, Chen Xishi, Liu Yunfang, Xu Yuanqing and others attended and discussed various issues. It was decided to hold the inaugural meeting at the Huamao Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road at 4 pm today, and respectfully invite Foreign Minister Chu Minyi and Japanese Ambassador to China Shigemitsu Aoi to attend and give speeches. The order is recorded as follows: (1) Preparatory Committee Member Wu Kaisheng reports on the process, (2) Chairman Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, and Yuan Fudeng deliver opening speeches, (3) Minister Chu, Ambassador Shigemitsu, Mayor Chen, Italian Ambassador to China Dai Liangyi, and celebrities Zhang Yipeng and others deliver speeches one after another. There will definitely be a grand occasion at that time.</p>

<p>Reader's Forum</p>
<h3>Please Pay Attention to Grain Rationing in the Urban Area</h3>
<p>— Yong Yan</p>
<p>After this forum published an article by Mr. Bai Hong yesterday on improving the order of imports at the North Railway Station, there have been repeated letters from readers reporting similar matters, which shows that this issue is very important to travelers. Not only should the order at the railway station be improved, but the traffic order at bus stations and ferry ports should also be improved. I hope readers will give us the actual situation of the difficulties they have experienced and suggestions for improvement, so that we can contribute them to the relevant authorities for improvement.</p>
<p>Since the authorities absolutely prohibited the free movement of rice in order to suppress black market grain prices, the people of Shanghai have been looking forward to the authorities setting an increased quota for household grain rations, which is like looking forward to rain during a severe drought. Recently, it has been reported that the population grain ration in the two concessions has gradually increased. Although it has not been realized, it is enough to make the residents of the urban area outside the two concessions express 120,000 points of envy. I live in western Shanghai and work in Pudong, so I know more about the current situation of grain rationing in the urban area. I will now describe the pain and minimum hope I have suffered recently as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Determine the Date of Grain Rationing: The two concessions ration grain based on population every 10 days, and the quantity and price are announced in the newspapers in advance. Since November, the urban area (Nanshi, western Shanghai, Zhabei, Pudong, etc.) has followed the methods of the concessions and issued rice purchase certificates. However, the date of rice purchase is not determined. It is now mid-January, and the rice purchase certificates for January have not yet been issued. Most of the residents in the urban area are engaged in production, with workers and small vendors being the most numerous. Very few families have stored grain. Now, they not only have no ability to buy black market rice and miscellaneous grains, but also have nowhere to buy them. The official distribution is also far away, which is really extremely anxious.</p>
<p>(2) Increase Grain Rations According to Actual Needs</p>
<p>Although there was a rumor several months ago that the grain rationing plan for the urban area was 3 he per person per day, the actual distribution quantity is far different from that of the two concessions. The quantity obtained by each person with a rice purchase certificate in December is as follows:</p>
<p>First time (issued in mid-December): 1.5 he of brown rice, 4 he of broken rice; Second time (end of December): 1.45 he of white rice, 1.5 jin of flour; Third time (issued on January 7th and 8th): 6 he of brown rice, 7 he of broken rice.</p>
<p>Before November, it was repeatedly postponed and canceled. According to the current rice and flour issued by the two concessions every ten days, it is only enough for five days of needs, and the actual distribution in the urban area in December is even more insufficient. Since the authorities have the determination to suppress grain prices, it is hoped that the population grain rations will be increased according to actual needs.</p>
<p>In short, Shanghai is an important place for China's industry and commerce. If the grain problem is not solved, it will repeatedly cause psychological anxiety among workers engaged in production. The population living in the urban areas of Pudong, western Shanghai, etc. is also more than 1.5 million, most of whom are workers. Therefore, in order to consolidate the foundation of Shanghai's industry and commerce, it is hoped that the authorities will pay special attention to the acquisition of grain by residents in the urban area.</p>
<p>Finally, after I finished writing the article, I learned that Pudong will distribute the first population grain ration for January in the next few days, with a distribution quantity of about 2 sheng per person, without flour matching. There is no news in western Shanghai yet. The date is not accurate, and the distribution quantity is less than that of the two concessions. I have been working in a factory recently and have witnessed dozens of workers and their families suffering from the pressure of insufficient food. They are struggling on the line of poor life all day long. The problem is quite serious. Everyone's expectation of the authorities' active relief is extremely keen. I hope the authorities will make up for it so that they can work and work hard in production with peace of mind.</p>
<h3>Sugar Rationing in Nanshi Has a Fixed Date / February 10th</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office, in order to protect the legitimate needs of citizens for sugar, has implemented a population-based sugar rationing system with the approval of the military distribution authorities. Recently, it has formulated simplified rules for population-based rationing, rules for managing retailers, and re-registering retailers who handle household sugar. The implementation date will be implemented after consultation with the relevant authorities. It has also been decided to start a pilot program in the Nanshi area from the fourth phase (ie, February 10th). After the implementation, sugar needed by various industries due to business needs will be specially allocated.</p>
<p>Retailers Divided into Groups for Management</p>
<p>The authorities have divided the 58 member sugar shops into groups, designated the baojia area, and are responsible for handling the matters entrusted by the cooperative business office and managing the retailers of type A. The distribution quantity and price of household sugar will be announced in the newspaper by the cooperative business office on the first day of each month. All retailers will be re-registered, numbered, and marked at the door for identification. After the population of each district is verified, a united guarantee will be used as the sugar distribution unit. The number of households in a united guarantee will be issued a sugar purchase certificate every month, which will be sent to the jiachang (head of a jia) by the sugar shop in the group, and then distributed to each huzhang (head of a household) by the jiachang, who can purchase sugar with the certificate. When the purchaser comes to purchase with the certificate, the retailer should check the baojia to which it belongs in order, and verify whether the seal affixed by the huzhang is consistent with the seal on the copy of the application form. If it is true, then the purchase is allowed.</p>
<h3>Consolidating the Police Force in Fengxian / Adjusting the Structure of the Police Bureau</h3>
<p>In order to consolidate the police force, the Fengxian District Office has adjusted the structure of the Police Bureau. In addition to the newly added director, inspector, and patrol officer, the original staff will be promoted if they are qualified. It is planned to appoint qualified personnel Chen Zhishan as the acting director of the Chengqu Police Station, Hu Deshan as the acting director of the Zhuanghang Police Station, Kuang Ming as an inspector, Zhang Ligu as the acting patrol officer of the Zhelin Branch, Lu Zhiping as the acting patrol officer of the Qingcungang Branch, and Li Chaoyang as the Police Bureau Patrol Officer. Xu Zunru was promoted to clerk, Sergeant Jin Wu was promoted to Patrol Officer, Inspector Yan Xingzheng was changed to Patrol Officer, and Zhai Yannian was changed to Inspector. Branch offices and police stations were set up in Qingcungang, Tai Ri Bridge, Nansi Tuan, Zhelin, Nanqiao, Qixian, Wu Jia Bridge and other places depending on the size of the place.</p>
<h3>Conscription and Drawing Lots Are All Groundless / Citizens Should Not Believe Rumors Lightly / Police Chief Lu Ying Refutes Rumors</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Shanghai News: Since the National Government officially announced its participation in the war, the atmosphere of British and American aggression in East Asia for a century has been completely wiped out. The 5 million citizens of this city are deeply supportive of this national policy of participating in the war. It has been found that rumors have been spreading in the urban area recently. The saying of conscription, drawing lots, and collective training is inconsistent, causing people to panic and be unable to live in peace. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Lu Ying, the director of the Municipal Police Bureau, yesterday to inquire about everything. He was welcomed and issued the following statement: "After the National Government officially announced its participation in the war, the East Asian axis was further strengthened, and the cooperation and cooperation with Allied countries became closer, which aroused the covetousness of treacherous people. The rumors of conscription and drawing lots were purely spread by these people. Their intention is obviously to disrupt social stability and divide the citizens' enthusiasm for cautiously participating in the war, which is very hateful. The central government has not yet considered the move of conscription and drawing lots. Therefore, what is spread from outside is absolutely incredible. I hope that citizens will not believe it and fall into the trap of traitors. They should live their lives in peace and not be impatient or panic. I am in charge of the municipal police administration in the urban area, and I will abide by Mayor Chen's instructions to stabilize the local area and maintain law and order, and work hard to maintain it. If anyone is found to be spreading rumors and causing trouble to confuse the people, they will be severely punished and will not be tolerated." According to another source, it is said that the National Military Commission has now sent an official telegram to Shanghai to refute the rumors, which shows that the rumors are absolutely untrue. I hope citizens will not believe them lightly.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Baojia Youth Department Selects New Members Again / No Political Role and No Military Goals / Letters Sent to Various United Guarantees Recommending and Hoping to Participate Voluntarily</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Shanghai News: The purpose of the establishment of the Public Concession Baojia Youth Department is to gather outstanding youths in the city and give them training in intelligence, physical fitness, and group work to serve the society. Its organization has no political role and no military goals. It is purely a youth assembly group for intelligence and discussion. Therefore, since the start of the first phase of training, even on the cold winter morning, the members still receive training at dawn. The spirit of perseverance and perseverance is admirable. At the beginning of this training, some outsiders who did not understand the truth had all kinds of misunderstandings and speculations, and even far-fetched associations, thinking that this technical training was related to military affairs. In fact, this kind of science training is only to strengthen the physical fitness of the members and has no other purpose. Now that the official establishment is approaching, academic training will begin. In view of the insufficient number of members, it is necessary to supplement them. Therefore, it is scheduled to select new members again this month. The department has sent letters to various united guarantees recommending them, and hopes that youths from various districts of the city will voluntarily participate. The qualification is still a junior high school graduation or above.</p>

<h3>Large Quantities of Coal Continuously Shipped to Shanghai - Fuel Reserves Substantial - 4,000 Tons of Kailan Coal Arrive Recently - Coal Merchants Stockpiling Goods with Few Buyers</h3>
<p>Considering the amount of bituminous coal used is no less important than essential items like food, relevant authorities in the city have been making efforts to actively source large quantities of domestic coal and continuously ship it to Shanghai for sale. Over the past few months, the amount of bituminous coal shipped to Shanghai has been increasing daily. Yesterday, a reporter learned from coal industry sources that the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha's "Eikou Maru" arrived here on the 16th of this month from Qinhuangdao and berthed at the No. 29 and No. 30 pontoons in the Huangpu River. The ship carried approximately 4,000 tons of Kailan lump coal. This coal was ordered by the Shanghai Waterworks Company and was already being unloaded and used some days ago. The production cost is said to be quite low.</p>
<p>Coal Arrives in Shanghai - One After Another</p>
<p>The reporter also learned from other sources that coal shipments to Shanghai have become increasingly smooth recently, due to convenient water and land transportation. It is understood that, in addition to some coal arriving by water transport, some is transported by train on the Jinpu Railway and Hainan Railway. The amount transported each time varies. Most of this coal comes from coal-producing areas in North China, while the rest comes from Korea. Because local coal production is abundant and supply exceeds demand, prices are low. If coal merchants obtain goods there and resell them here at the limited price, they can still make a considerable profit.</p>
<p>Reserves Increase Daily - Market Situation Stabilizes</p>
<p>It has been observed that the use of bituminous coal in the city has decreased significantly compared to the past, partly because factories are saving fuel and partly because residents are economizing. This is due to the high price. As a result, sales are sluggish and reserves have increased sharply. According to someone familiar with the coal market yesterday, current stockpiles of bituminous coal in warehouses in Pudong, Hongkou, West Shanghai, and the French Concession total no less than several hundred thousand tons. Because usage is decreasing and sales are not as brisk as in the past, there are few buyers for spot coal. The market situation has become extremely stable. In summary, there is no fear of a coal shortage.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Revises Unified Tax on Cotton Yarn and Matches</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs issued a notice regarding the revision of the unified tax on imported cotton yarn and matches, stating that from the 16th of this month, the tax rates will be revised to 5% and 10% ad valorem, respectively. All merchants should be informed.</p>
<h3>Seamen's Special Party Department Reorganized - Wu Lanxi Makes Statement Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wu Lanxi, Zhang Xianzhi, and Peng Shengtian, members of the reorganization committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party's Seamen's Special Party Department, have arrived in Shanghai successively. Yesterday afternoon, at approximately 2:00 PM, Wu and others went by car to the Chinese Seamen's Special Party Department on Minquan Road to begin the takeover. Mr. Kai Chen personally handled the handover. Wu and others immediately appointed Yang Shaozhi and eight original staff members of the Party Department to handle the inventory. Public business will resume as usual starting this morning, and reorganization will begin.</p>
<p>Statement Issued - Supporting National Policy</p>
<p>After taking over the Party Department yesterday, Wu Lanxi, a member of the reorganization committee of the Seamen's Special Party Department, made a statement to the Central News Agency reporter who visited, saying that there are a total of 800,000 seamen comrades. In this turbulent era, the tasks and missions undertaken by all seamen are extremely important. In the future, all comrades should unite to use the strength of 800,000 seamen to follow the national policy, support the leader, and complete the mission of participating in the war. As for the reorganization method, a step-by-step system should be adopted to strengthen the existing institutions.</p>
<h3>French Concession Shops Close Before 8:00 PM</h3>
<p>According to a Datong News Agency reporter, the authorities of the French Concession, in order to save electricity, have advised all shops in the concession, except for hotels, restaurants, dance halls, and entertainment venues, to close before 8:00 PM. Those who stay open past that time will be punished.</p>
<h3>Boiler Factory Penalized for Violations</h3>
<p>Qian Xinchang Boiler Factory at No. 98, Lane 595, Macau Road, was penalized because it manufactured a soaker without the supervision of a certified boiler engineer, violating regulations. The Bureau repeatedly sent letters of warning, but they were ignored. Therefore, the Industrial and Social Affairs Bureau filed a public prosecution with the Special No. 1 Court. As a result, Qian Baoyu, the manager of the factory, was sentenced to ten days of detention as a warning.</p>
<h3>Chairman of Japanese Chamber of Commerce Returns to Shanghai - Japanese Industrial and Factory Businesses Plan to Move to Shanghai for New Development - Shanghai to Become Financial Center of East Asia - Rebuilding Economic Fortress and Strengthening Cooperation</h3>
<p>Mr. Takeuchi, Chairman of the Shanghai Japanese General Chamber of Commerce and Industry, returned to Japan on December 29th of last year to discuss planned economic affairs in the Shanghai area with domestic government authorities. He arrived in Shanghai from Tokyo some days ago and plans to convene a joint meeting of the Chinese and Japanese Chambers of Commerce and Industry within the next few days. In addition to taking the opportunity to state national policies, he will strive to obtain the cooperation of Chinese business and industrial figures to promote the economic structure of the Far East region after China's participation in the war.</p>
<p>Shanghai as the Economic Center of East Asia</p>
<p>After returning to Shanghai from Japan, Mr. Takeuchi gave an interview to the press, saying that Shanghai's economic construction is a basic condition for comprehensive cooperation between China and Japan. Unless Shanghai can focus on economic construction to achieve full economic control of China, it will be difficult for Japan to gain the hearts of the Chinese people and there will be no way to consolidate cooperation between the two countries. Generally speaking, within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, Tokyo is considered the center of politics and diplomacy, while the center of economy and finance must be Shanghai. Therefore, Chinese and Japanese business and industrial figures in Shanghai must first recognize the importance of Shanghai's position and the importance of their own mission, and be willing to work together to overcome the difficulties of the times.</p>
<p>Japanese Light Industry Plans to Move to Shanghai</p>
<p>Mr. Takeuchi continued, saying that during his recent return to Japan, he had discussions with government authorities. Based on his personal observations, relevant government and business figures generally believe that "rebuilding the Shanghai economy" is a necessary condition for resolving the China dispute. Currently, various Japanese light industrial factories are planning to move to Shanghai for new development in order to take on the mission of economic revival. In this way, Shanghai will become the center of light industry in East Asia, and the economic development of the city can be expected to undergo an epoch-making transformation. In addition, in view of the close relationship between Shanghai and Japan's nationwide mobilization economy, Shanghai's economic structure must be built on a permanent foundation.</p>
<h3>Demand Deposit Reserves to be Paid in Two Installments - Inspection of Bank Operations and Assets Proceeding Smoothly and Well</h3>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank's Financial Affairs Inspection Office, in accordance with the Interim Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions, is conducting inspections of the operations, assets, and liabilities of various financial institutions. The work is proceeding very smoothly. Currently, monthly operating statements from various banks, money shops, and trust companies in the city have been submitted for inspection on schedule every month since September of last year, and the results are good. The organization of these financial institutions has become sound and their operations have returned to normal. Regarding the required reserve funds for term deposits and special demand deposits of various financial institutions, they have all been consolidated in accordance with the provisions of 5% or more of the total amount, and have been paid into reserve accounts opened with the Central Reserve Bank. As for the reserve fund of 10% or more for demand deposits, it will begin to be handled after the end of the lunar new year general closing accounts. It is heard that the inspection office, in order to consider the actual difficulties of various financial institutions, will handle the payment of demand deposit reserve funds in two installments.</p>
<h3>Bean Curd Industry Petitions Authorities to Continue Allotment of Soybeans - If the Industry is Forced to Shut Down, Thousands of Workers Will Be Destitute</h3>
<p>Local bean curd industry is petitioning because the authorities have expanded the scope of food rationing to include beans, which are temporarily prohibited from moving until allotment. The industry's limited bean stocks will not be able to meet market demand, and it is on the verge of closing down. Yesterday, it specifically submitted documents to the Public Works Bureau and the Grain Military Allotment Group, stating: "To whom it may concern, now that the authorities have controlled beans and prohibited their movement, the black market has disappeared. However, your office has not yet provided any allotment, and we have no way to purchase beans at this time. We are forced to shut down, and dozens of workers will directly suffer the pain of unemployment. Approximately tens of thousands of people indirectly depend on this industry for their livelihood, and they will inevitably starve to death, which will have a huge impact on the livelihood of ordinary people. The members of our industry have come to the association one after another, asking for ways to provide relief. Therefore, we have specifically written to your office to ask how the allotment matters should be handled, and we request a prompt reply so that we can report it to the authorities for record."</p>
<h3>Restructuring of Da Zhonghua Match Company Completed - Capital of 10 Million Shared 40/60 Between China and Japan - List of Founders and Managers Released</h3>
<p>The "Da Zhonghua Match Company," which was placed under Japanese military management on December 8th of last year, decided to reorganize its internal business structure after the designation of "enemy property" was lifted.

<h3>Special District Private Primary and Secondary Schools - Temporary Relief Fund for Faculty and Staff - Education Committee Handles Distribution Procedures</h3>
<p>The special district's private primary and secondary school faculty and staff temporary relief fund, since the central government approved the allocation of 350,000 yuan, has been handled by the Shanghai Special District Private Primary and Secondary School Faculty and Staff Temporary Relief Fund Committee, jointly formed by the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Finance, and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government. Since its establishment, it has strived to use the simplest method to distribute the funds as early as possible. Because there are many schools and faculty and staff receiving relief funds, and many changes have occurred in the past six months, in order to make the distribution procedures as perfect as possible and avoid future disputes, the committee is carefully compiling statistics on the number of schools and faculty and staff. It is learned that the committee has stipulated the points that schools applying for relief funds should pay attention to, as well as the faculty and staff forms, and has sent them to each school for reference.</p>

<p>Mr. Li Ji, in view of the fact that the amount of money in this newspaper's scholarship fund, generously donated by various circles, has reached more than 100,000 yuan, but there are 4,000 to 5,000 applicants, deeply feels that it is difficult to provide assistance universally, and is concerned that students will lose the opportunity to study. Yesterday, he specifically generously donated more than 4,700 yuan. Mr. Li Ji works in the financial sector, is enthusiastic about public welfare, and is fond of doing good deeds. He is especially willing to do his best to help poor students. This generous donation is most admirable. Moreover, his unwillingness to announce his surname further shows his sincerity in doing good. We are grateful for Mr. Li Ji's enthusiasm, and we deeply believe that people in the business, industry, and financial sectors will be able to provide support with the same spirit, so that Mr. Li Ji's advocacy and sponsorship will be forever remembered by the students who are assisted.</p>

We should make a correction and express our apologies.</p>
<p>Notification Slips - We Urge You to Fill Them Out and Submit Them</p>
<p>The number of students applying is as mentioned above. The This Newspaper Readers' Scholarship Committee deeply believes that the scholarship funds are insufficient, which will cause excellent students to be unable to complete their studies due to the limited amount of scholarships. Not only will the committee feel guilty that the matter has not been completed, but it will also be a loss for society that cannot be compensated. Now, a donation notification slip is listed on the left. It is hoped that readers, when they have a kind thought, will immediately fill it out, send it to this newspaper, and donate any amount of money, regardless of how much or little. The enthusiasm for doing good is the same. With the wide readership of this newspaper and the dense population of Shanghai, if everyone can happily donate ten yuan, a large sum of money can be quickly collected. Donating only requires donors to lift a finger, while the beneficiaries will have unlimited benefits. Also, yesterday, Mr. Zhu Guangchi of the paper industry and Mr. Yang Yuanchao filled out donation notification slips, and this newspaper sent staff to collect them, which was a very simple procedure.</p>

<h3>Public Men's Basketball Division A - Xingren Team Eight Wins and No Losses - Defeated Monocle Last Night</h3>
<p>The All-Shanghai Public Basketball Tournament, jointly sponsored by the Shanghai Sports Association and the Chinese Youth Association, held three games last night at 10:00 PM in the Chinese Youth Gymnasium. The first game was a women's division game between the Friends Team and the Liu Lingsheng Team. The former had strong talent, and Deng Xiangchun, Huang Mingyuan, Liu Zhenbao, Yan Weiwen, and others were exceptionally active. The Liu Lingsheng Team was unable to withstand the attack, and the game became one-sided. As a result, the Friends Team defeated the Liu Lingsheng Team with a score of 42 to 9. The team has already achieved a record of two wins in two games in the first round. The championship seems all but assured. In the second game of the men's division A, Lianxing defeated Tongren with a score of 47 to 31. In the first half, the score was 22 to 16, with Lianxing in the lead. In another game, Xingren faced Monocle. The former had seven wins in seven games and harbored ambitions of winning the championship. The latter had also defeated strong teams such as Giant and Lianxing, and their momentum was strong. Therefore, the first half of the game was very tense. Xingren relied on the efforts of Lin Wanli, Zhuo Guorong, and others to take the lead with a score of 16 to 13. In the second half, Xingren had smooth sailing, and Monocle could not reverse the situation. When time was called, Xingren defeated Monocle with a score of 36 to 21. The current situation in men's division A is that Xingren is in the lead with eight wins in eight games. There are still two games remaining, against the Ice Team and the North Wind Team. Based on past results, Xingren's victory should be no problem. The Red Team is currently closely following with seven wins and one loss, and can be expected to take the runner-up position. There are three games tonight.</p>

<h3>Chinese Stocks Have Hidden Strength - More Up Than Down</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Chinese stock market turned into a spinning state, the base was solid, most stocks rose and few fell back. The cash sellers were absorbed by new and old investments, there was hidden strength in buying momentum, and sentiment remained bullish. Demand for Nanyang Tobacco Company shares continued to increase, rising from 124 yuan to 7.5 yuan and then another 4 yuan on the day. Great China Match also rose to around 325 yuan. The buying momentum in the department store industry was also strong, with many transactions of Lihua Company shares at 340 yuan. Wing On Company rose back to 133 yuan, and Sincere rose to 142.5 yuan, each rising more than 2 yuan. National Goods Company continued to fluctuate between 76 and 77 yuan. In the textile industry, Wing On Textile Mill rose 2.5 yuan to 240 yuan with buyers. Dasheng No. 1 Mill rose again to 415 yuan and was difficult to obtain. Rongfeng Textile lacked buyers and plummeted to below 40 yuan of premium, as low as 35 yuan. When Xinfeng Printing and Dyeing saw high prices, sellers also rose, falling back to 18.25 yuan. Kaili Silk and Satin had few supplies with demand at 14 yuan. Great China Weaving once exceeded the 10 yuan mark but immediately fell back. In the end, it and Hongsheng made some progress. In the new pharmaceutical industry, Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory lacked momentum for a price pull, falling slightly by 2.5 yuan. Xinya rose to 25.25 yuan, but was pushed back to 24.5 yuan by sellers. Sino-French new shares rose 0.5 yuan, reaching a maximum of 28 yuan. Xinyi rose to 50 yuan. Wuzhou Pharmacy soared to 660 yuan. In the cultural industry, only China Bookstore rose sharply, reaching a high price of 192 yuan again. Commercial Press rose another 5 yuan.

Chinese Securities rose again to 140 yuan. Food stocks rose and fell differently. Except for Lao Zhengxing reaching 400 yuan, transactions in the same industry were flourishing.</p>
<h3>High Interest Rates on Loans - Government Bonds Difficult to Improve</h3>
<p>The government bond market remained sluggish yesterday. Initially, there was a slight rise, but then it fell again. Observing this situation, the various parties seemed to want to push up the price in order to find a clever way to sell them off. Since the implementation of control, the various parties have been under too much pressure from interest rates. It has been a long time, and as the end of the year approaches, those with expiring bonds who are urging redemption are flocking in. Moreover, with loan interest rates reaching 2.8%, the burden feels even more worrisome. It would be fortunate if it could stop above 50 yuan within the year. There are few days left, and there are fears that there will be more drastic changes within days. Yesterday's market price was 0.7 yuan for Class B, over 9 yuan for Class D, 0.3-0.4 yuan for Class E, and Class C once rose to 2.2 yuan, but then fell to 1.7 yuan, and finally to 1.7-1.8 yuan. At present, the only difficulty is the economic problem.</p>
<h3>Impressions on the Central Bank's Interbank Short-Term Lending</h3>
<p>— Also Speaking of</p>
<p>The Shanghai financial market, since December 15th of last year, has shown a phenomenon of tight credit. In recent days, due to the approaching Lunar New Year, all industries are carrying out settlements, and credit has become even tighter. Now, the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank, in order to regulate the positions of various banks, has resolutely launched interbank short-term lending. The method is that various banks can borrow from the Central Bank by pledging the following items: (1) real estate within the Public or French Concession, (2) public bonds and treasury bills issued by the Joint Reserve Board, (3) non-speculative and non-essential goods, (4) valuable securities recognized by the Central Bank, etc., with a maximum term not exceeding three months.</p>
<p>This move by the Central Bank is indeed what a national bank should do to fulfill its mission. Because national banks in various countries enjoy special privileges such as issuing banknotes, managing national reserves, acting as treasury agents, managing national settlements, regulating interest rates, and buying and selling gold and silver, their financial strength is extremely strong. Whenever market changes occur and various industries urgently need cash, the national bank uses its strong funds to assist private banks through discounting or mortgage loans, indirectly benefiting industry and commerce. As for directly contacting the industrial and commercial sectors to engage in ordinary deposit and loan business, most of it has been undertaken by commercial banks, and national banks in various countries rarely take this as their business.</p>
<p>According to the current tight credit in Shanghai, if it is not regulated for a long time, the harm to finance and domestic industry and commerce will be significant. Firstly, if credit continues to tighten, the demand for cash will increase, and as a result, the long-disappeared practice of discounting bills will reappear today, making the unified financial system prone to disorder again. Secondly, various banks, considering the tightening of credit and the lack of their own positions, will inevitably try to recover the funds they previously lent to various manufacturers, and as a result, ordinary factories engaged in production will face financial difficulties, and factories will be forced to reduce or stop work. If this continues, the shortage of materials will inevitably worsen, and the rise in prices will become more severe, which will have an adverse impact on the national economy and people's livelihood. Therefore, the Central Bank's interbank short-term lending this time is the most appropriate method to stabilize finance and assist industry and commerce. And the general large and small banks can also develop closer ties with the Central Bank through this lending, further prompting the Central Bank to become a bank of banks.</p>
<h3>Military Notes and Joint Reserve Notes Rise Together</h3>
<p>Yesterday, military notes remained strong, with interbank trading at $5.558, soon falling back to $5.556, but still rising slightly. Small money shops and silver houses quoted $5.55 and $5.56 for buying and selling. Joint Reserve notes rose another 2 cents, with operators selling at $3.77 and buying at $3.7. Yesterday morning, the Shanghai Money Trade Association's overnight interest rate remained unchanged at 1.7 cents.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, the cotton cloth market continued to show a potential for firmness, but transactions were quite thin. "Four Gentlemen" calico rose from $9.45 to $9.57, an increase of 1.5 cents. Peach blossom lady's colored cloth from Linbu was $390.</p>
<h3>Soap and Matches Reach Record High Prices</h3>
<p>The market for daily necessities is rising steadily, and by the afternoon, soap prices were shockingly high, with new record highs emerging endlessly. Gu Ben soap continued to rise to $720, Bai Xiang Mao $650, Huang Xiang Mao soap $800, and Scissors soap $680, an increase of $20 to $30 from the previous day. Such high prices are staggering, causing the general public to be unable to bear the burden. The match market also experienced a sharp price increase. There were rumors of the reopening of the Zhong Fa warehouse, which made general cargo owners rejoice. Phoenix brand reached $4,000, Beautiful brand $4,200, Golden Tripod brand $3,500, and miscellaneous brands $2,400, an increase of about $500 from the previous day. Candle prices were too high, leading to weaker demand and lower prices. White Leith's ship brand was $560, Monk's Cap $480, and miscellaneous brands $320, remaining relatively flat.</p>
<h3>Hua Yuan Distributes Goods, Cigarette Price Increases Settled</h3>
<p>The cigarette market price increase has stabilized, as some profit-takers seek to sell. Hua Yuan distributed goods to small dealers yesterday, so the market sentiment has stabilized slightly. British Brand was $11,800, Old Knife Brand $10,300, Pin Hai Brand $7,700, Five Hua Brand $6,800, Fairy Brand $7,900, Japanese Tobacco Golden Gun Brand $3,150, Red Rose $2,750, Golden Building $3,800, All Six Brand $3,550, Twenty Sticks $3,250, and Compass Brand $2,850. National Tobacco Pyramid was $6,300, Beautiful Brand $5,850, Golden Mouse Brand $4,200, White Golden Dragon $4,200, and Golden Dragon $3,250, all showing weakness. It is rumored that the ad valorem tax will be implemented soon, and prices may not fall.</p>
<h3>Soybean Cake Trading is Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market for miscellaneous grains remained unusually quiet. Soybean cake trading was also quite flat, and the market lacked luster. Kai Yuan Long soybean cake was priced at $93.75 per car, and Yuan Ji soybean cake was priced at $87 for 500 pieces.</p>
<h3>This Batch of Sugar Will Be Moved Soon</h3>
<p>According to sources at the Joint Venture Office, the allocation of this batch of sugar has been signed, and purchase certificates have been issued. Movement certificates will also be processed, and goods will be shipped soon to meet the needs of the Lunar New Year.</p>
<h3>Dried Shrimp Returns Firmly After Extreme Fatigue</h3>
<p>Yantai dried shrimp has been in short supply recently. It is heard that the subsequent batch is difficult to arrive in Shanghai, so the trend has tightened. Yesterday, the market price was $2,500, an increase of $300 from the previous month.</p>
<h3>Tinplate is About to Run Out</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was a great deal of interest in 180-pound double-linked and 90-pound/100-pound single-linked small tinplate, but because the inventory of this product on the market is very thin, there has even been concern about running out recently. It is not easy for general factories in urgent need to find it, and some have switched to processing company iron, narrow iron, green lead iron, and black iron billets, etc. Unfortunately, the number of raw materials for the above-mentioned products is also exceptionally scarce, and the asking price is high, and people in the industry are unwilling to sell easily. Currently, 90-pound and 100-pound single-linked iron are priced at $1,200 per box, and 180-pound double-linked plates are priced at $2,400 per box, but very few transactions have been made at these prices.</p>

<h3>Third Place in the Essay Contest - My Plans for This Year</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Time flies like a white colt glimpsed through a crack. The thirty-first year of the Republic of China has already passed, and the thirty-second year is about to begin. My age is only one year less than a complete cycle of sixty. Recalling the past fifty-eight years, I first diligently studied day and night when the imperial examinations had not yet been abolished, hoping to gain fame and fortune, but only achieved the status of a lower-level scholar. Then, I abandoned my pen for the army, studying military strategy to serve the country, but only led troops to attack Ning. Finally, I came to Shanghai to make a living, handling association affairs and writing articles, and another twenty-one years have passed in a flash. In between, I sometimes studied medicine, sometimes studied law, and sometimes taught in schools. In short, I studied both literature and martial arts, but achieved nothing. How ashamed I am! According to the old customs of our country, nearing the age of sixty, one can stay at home and enjoy a life of ease, no longer working. However, although I have three sons and one daughter, they are still in school. My family has no inheritance, and the eight members of my family rely entirely on my writing to make a living. Even if I want to rest, I am constrained by my family's circumstances and cannot. Fortunately, my spirit is still strong. Every day, the place where I work extends east to Jiangxi Road, south to Longmen Road, west to Jing'an Temple Road, and north to North Mud City Bridge. I walk everywhere without taking a car and feel no fatigue at all. After work, I still enjoy scribbling to write articles. Now that I see the topic of the essay contest in Shen Bao's Free Talk: "My Plans for This Year," I am reminded of the things I have done in the past, drifting with the current, without any pre-determined plans. Therefore, I have been like a wandering horse, doing many things but not specializing in any, wasting years, and my temples are already gray, but I still have no achievements to speak of. Now I plan to take this opportunity to define my plans for this year as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Regarding society, divided into the following four points:</p>
<p>(1) For the various associations I serve in, I shall arrive on time for the stipulated office hours every day to set an example.</p>
<p>(2) For the official documents handled, I shall determine the order of drafting, writing, and distributing according to the order of arrival and the urgency of the facts, and shall not delay.</p>
<p>(3) For charitable causes, although due to my circumstances, I cannot provide financial assistance, I should adhere to the principle of contributing money if I have it, and contributing effort if I have strength. I should do my best to help with errands, because in this extraordinary period, Shanghai urgently needs to provide relief to the refugees. While there are many who suffer from their own deeds, there are also those who have fallen due to natural disasters and human misfortunes. As descendants of the Yellow Emperor with the same round faces and square feet, we cannot turn a blind eye to their freezing and starving. Not only will the nation be affected, but if we ask ourselves, it is also inexcusable. Mencius said: "Compassion is in everyone's heart." Although I am not rich, I am still well-fed and clothed, which is ultimately more comfortable than them. When meeting people, I should speak out, and I should convey my ideas in writing. Whatever I can do within my power is what we poor scholars should do and should not give up.</p>
<p>(4) When discussing proposals at meetings, I should be calm and study the facts, not giving in to personal feelings. If something should be approved, I should remove any difficulties to ensure its establishment and passage. If something should be rejected, even if there are requests for help, I should reject them to ensure its rejection and cancellation.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding family, divided into the following five points:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding household expenses, although I adhere to the principle of living within my means, last year, due to the increase in prices, like a runaway horse, it went straight ahead, and I had to increase expenses monthly. However, although food prices rose, the quantity decreased, causing the children to fall ill due to malnutrition. The required medical expenses were very high and exceeded the budget, which seemed unworthy. Therefore, this year, I should strive to choose foods that are cheaper and definitely beneficial to health. Being skilled in selection means that vegetables are not always inferior to fish and meat.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding clothing, because my residence in the Soviet district was almost completely looted, all the clothes, large and small, had to be remade. Compared to the prices of clothing materials and tailoring a few years ago, the prices last year were vastly different. Everyone regretted not making them earlier when prices were lower, and blamed me for adopting a laissez-faire attitude and not adding more clothes earlier when prices were cheap. However, I think this is a special situation and not a lesson to be learned. This year, I should still adhere to the principle of saving where possible and should not make more useless and redundant clothes just because prices are rising, in order to avoid waste. In this environment, being able to have warm clothes is already not easy. We must take a step back and think about the refugees who are now sleeping on the sidewalks without clothes or food. A few years ago, some of them were eating delicacies and wearing silks and satins. Not disliking old and worn clothes is the beauty of Yu the Great and Zilu. We should always adhere to their teachings and dare not forget them, especially in the current extraordinary period.</p>
<p>(3) The children are young and live in prosperous Shanghai, only knowing the surface and not knowing the substance. What they hear and see is easily influenced by the environment. I plan to cut out and compile news reports about young people who are weak-willed or frequent dance halls or gamble, leading to debt and doing dishonorable things: such as gambling away public funds, falsely reporting robberies, conspiring to kill dancers and steal their jewelry, etc., and place them on the desk for them to read as novels, so that they can understand that prosperity and evil sound similar and have a related relationship, recognize the lessons of the past, and be cautious and tread carefully, knowing what to avoid and daring not to try.</p>
<p>(4) Although the children are studying at university, they are still studying English, mathematics, and various sciences, and their grades are good, but they lack knowledge of Chinese studies, which seems to be a shortcoming. They even do not understand the meaning of extremely common allusions, and their explanations are often wrong. Therefore, this year, I plan to take advantage of the holidays to explain Chinese studies to them, choosing the common knowledge necessary for life and what is used in social interactions, and explain the origin and meaning of these allusions in detail so that they will not be misused in the future and cause ridicule.</p>
<p>(5) Since the Ming Dynasty, my family has moved from Yunnan to He, and generations have been scholars, with the old saying of "twenty generations of fragrance." The wise words and deeds of our ancestors are detailed in the family genealogy, which should be firmly remembered and practiced by descendants. After the Taiping Rebellion, the family property was lost. Fortunately, this genealogy was preserved by our ancestor Xunzhi Gong. When I was young, my father, Libo Gong, would choose a time to explain it. Eight years ago, due to years of insect damage, it was re-copied into two volumes and given to close relatives to copy. There have been changes in these eight years, and the dates of all the newly deceased and newly born people have not been filled in. If we wait a few more years, it may be difficult to investigate. Therefore, this year, I plan to create a table and send letters to each branch of the family, asking them to fill in the details so that we can supplement the information. I plan to separately record the family instructions of all the ancestors and have the children read them reverently during each sacrificial period, so that they can be imprinted in their minds.</p>
<p>(C) Regarding personal matters, divided into the following four points:</p>
<p>(1) In recent years, being forced by the pressure of food and clothing, I have been involved in too many things, and it is inevitable that there will be negligence in handling matters. Starting this year, I plan to stipulate a fixed office time. For things that should be done, I will adhere to the principle of not postponing what should be done today until tomorrow, and I will carefully implement this to avoid omissions.</p>
<p>(2) Recently, because my brainpower is weaker, and I hear too many things, I tend to forget the things that friends ask me to do in a moment. This year, I plan to specially compile a book and carefully record everything in it, like the "Diligent Pen Avoids Thought" wooden plaque hung in old-fashioned shops. I will place it on my desk, flipping through it every day and processing things in order.</p>
<p>(3) Reviewing the old and learning the new should not be neglected. In recent years, being burdened with too many things, I have had no time to read books. I have only output and no input, and my talent is about to dry up. Starting this year, in addition to reading the newspaper every day, I will stipulate that I read a sentence of a book every day to increase my knowledge.</p>
<p>(4) My income is limited, but my social interactions are too many. This year, whenever relatives and friends send red and white invitations, I will stipulate that I send a congratulatory poem and a small mirror frame for happy events, and write an eulogy on jade paper for funerals, without mounting them, adhering to the five-word secret of "a light gift with heavy meaning."</p>
<p>The above are the main points of the plans I have made. After implementation, I will still record them in my diary every day for inspection. At the end of the year, I will then carefully review how much I have been able to accomplish to encourage myself. (Note: Mr. Sun is 59 years old and is the secretary of the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association.)</p>
<h3>Priestley—Letters from World-Renowned Scientists</h3>
<p>— Translated by Sincoln Scougte Gu Xin</p>
<p>Previous Cause: Joseph Priestley was a non-conformist preacher, scientist, and politician who did not believe in the Church of England. He was also a restless dissident in both chemical research and religion. This world-famous chemist, the discoverer of oxygen, nitrous oxide, and sulfur dioxide, often made things difficult for himself, not only for his unorthodox views but also for his courage to speak his mind.</p>
<p>Born in 1733, he lived in Birmingham. When Edmund Burke denounced "terror" in his "Reflections on the French Revolution," Priestley vehemently opposed him and was therefore regarded as a citizen of the French Republic. Ordinary 19th-century defenders of the faith in Birmingham were enraged by his heresies and burned his house and church to the ground. His laboratory was also destroyed, his library devastated, and many valuable and irreplaceable manuscripts were destroyed. After this shocking act of barbarism, Priestley wrote this letter to his Birmingham compatriots.</p>
<p>"...We are sheep, and you are wolves." Text: My former compatriots and neighbors,</p>
<p>I have lived with you for eleven years, during which you have all known my peaceful behavior. I have only quietly paid attention to my professional duties and philosophical duties. I never thought that I and my friends would suffer such damage from you. But you are mistaken. You have heard non-conformists, especially Unitarian Dissenters, constantly being ridiculed and treated as enemies of the current government in both church and state, so you thought that any damage to me would be a meritorious deed: I did not receive better notice in time to take any measures.</p>
<p>When the "purpose" is correct, you think the "means" are always correct. Due to the speeches of your teachers, the cries of your superiors, the confusion and curses directed at me (everyone knows these are their usual habits), your superstition was aroused to the highest degree, and no one said anything to you to reduce your enthusiasm. Everything only added fuel to the fire to ignite your enthusiasm: therefore, you did not think for yourselves, nor for those who should know everything and teach you well. You were prepared to commit all kinds of atrocities, and they should really know everything and teach you well. You thought that the resentment and damage you had done to us were to uphold the government, especially to uphold the church. You were also led to think that by "destroying" us, "you" would "definitely" perform the most practical "service" to "God" and your country.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the British psyche holds a fear of "murder," so I hope you did not think of "this." ... But if you exhaust all means to make life unbearable, what is the value of life? ...</p>
<p>You have destroyed the most valuable and useful instruments among philosophical instruments, instruments that no individual has in this country or any other country. When I used them, I spent a lot of money every year, without any monetary ideas, just to promote science for the benefit of my country and mankind. You also destroyed a library related to those instruments, and the books in this library cannot be repurchased with money except for a long time. But what I am especially saddened by is that you destroyed many "manuscripts," which are the result of many years of hard work, and which I can no longer rewrite; and the person who suffered this kind of evil deed is someone who has never done or imagined any harm to you. ...</p>
<p>If you imagine that your behavior has any effect on your motives, or can hinder our motives, you are even more wrong. There is nothing that can maintain any religious system except "reason" and "logic." Answer our arguments, and your business will succeed: but you resort to "violence," which only proves that you cannot do anything good. Even if you destroy me, and destroy my house, library, and instruments, then another ten people with the same spirit and ability, or even more outstanding people, will immediately rise up.</p>
<p>In this matter, we are sheep, and you are wolves. We want to preserve our integrity, and hope you will change your character. In any case, we want to repay evil with good: pray that you will soon return to that diligence and sobriety with which the residents of Birmingham are known.</p>
<p>I am your sincere and well-wishing person. J Priestley</p>
<p>July 19, 1791, in London.</p>
<p>Aftermath: Because of this disaster, Priestley left Birmingham and went to London. He lived there for three years, and then sailed to America. As soon as he arrived in New York, he received a warm welcome. After that, he wrote a history of the church, continued to conduct chemical experiments in Northumberland, Pennsylvania, and died there in 1804. In the middle of the eighteenth century, few Englishmen did more work for scientific progress. (End of this article)</p>
<h3>The Paragon of Teachers</h3>
<p>— By James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin</p>
<p>What they took back with them was also a memory of a beautiful woman who received them and spoke to them, because several years later, during the First European War, one day, in a large military camp near Brockfield, a soldier came to visit Chips, saying that he was one of the players who first came to compete in football. Chips invited him for tea and chatted with him. Later, when shaking hands to say goodbye, this person said, "How is your wife, sir? I remember her very well."</p>
<p>"Really?" Chips replied enthusiastically. "You really remember her?"</p>
<p>"Of course? I think everyone does."</p>
<p>Chips replied: "They don't, you know. At least, not here. Students come and go, always new faces: memories don't last long. Even the teachers don't stay forever. Since last year—after old Gribble—he was the school's food manager—none of the people here have seen my wife. You know, she died less than a year after you came. In 1898."</p>
<p>"I was truly saddened to hear that, sir. At least two or three people in our team remember her very clearly, even though we only saw her that once. Yes, we remember her, that's right."</p>
<p>"I'm very glad. ... That was the happiest day for all of us—and it was a wonderful game."</p>
<p>"One of the happiest days of my life. I'd rather have those days than these days—that's what I think. I'm going to France tomorrow."</p>
<p>About a month later, Chips heard that this person had died in the Battle of Passchendaele.</p>
<p>(7)</p>
<p>Now, the situation is like a warm and vivid period in his life, radiating a glow, burning hotly in thousands of memories. The school bell has become a roll call bell, and the glow in Mrs. Wicket's house brings back those memories to him in a cloud of fog—Caterall walks along the stone cloister, ridiculing him for some "big mistake" in a paper he has corrected, taking the cello part from a Mozart trio for use in the school's music club, her creamy arms sweeping across the brown light of the cello.

<h3>Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association Actively Designs Relief Work</h3>
<p>The internal organization of the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association, in addition to the Executive and Supervisory Committee and the Standing Committee, also has a Design Committee, which designs relief work; a Review Committee, which reviews the use of donations; and a Custody Committee, which manages donations. All are enthusiastic public-spirited people from all walks of life. Yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock, the Design Committee held a meeting on the fourth floor of the Bank Association on Yihang Road. More than 20 people attended, including Chairman Xiang Kangyuan, Vice Chairman Chen Binhe, and Committee Members Wang Shuxian and Cai Renbao. It was resolved that there are many relief design matters, and the original regulations will still be followed to actively subsidize various charitable organizations to carry out work such as porridge distribution, clothing distribution, orphan education, disabled person care, medical treatment, and music therapy. However, thorough investigations and detailed statistics must be made, and the priority of relief matters must be distinguished, and concrete plans must be made. In addition, it is also planned to hold temporary porridge coupon distributions. The issue of donations has also been decided. The donations currently received are still far from the original target of 5 million yuan, and the distribution is really difficult to cover. All associations that have pledged donations must quickly urge payment so that they can be distributed to various charitable organizations as soon as possible, because the cold and hungry refugees in the middle of winter are waiting for relief urgently. For groups or enthusiastic people in society who have not yet pledged donations, fundraising will continue. The discussion adjourned at 6:45 pm.</p>
<h3>Mr. Wu Jiliang Donates Clothing</h3>
<p>Yesterday, we received a letter from reader Mr. Wu Jigen stating: "I, being mindful of the harsh winter and the pitiful plight of orphaned and hungry children on the streets, and motivated by a sense of human compassion, have saved from my own meals to purchase four sets of children's cotton clothing. However, recognizing my limited resources and fearing the difficulty of managing charitable distribution, lest these clothes be resold by the recipients, thus betraying my original intention, I have enclosed four clothing vouchers, earnestly requesting your discretion in distributing them." (Editor's note: Besides expressing our gratitude to Mr. Wu, we will carefully select those in need for distribution.)</p>
<h3>Report on Famine Relief Funds</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Junsheng: 100 yuan</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Yangzuo: 40 yuan</p>
<p>Yuan Ji: 20 yuan</p>
<p>Previous Balance: 13,743 yuan</p>
<p>Final Balance: 13,903 yuan</p>
<h3>Zhengzhong Girls' School Offers Reduced-Fee Studentships</h3>
<p>Zhengzhong Girls' Middle School, located at 167 Da Tong Road, in consideration of the financial burden on students' parents, provides half-fee and full-fee scholarships for young women from truly impoverished families who are determined to advance their education. There are five studentships available in each grade from Junior Middle School Year 1 to Senior Middle School Year 3, totaling sixty studentships. For those with outstanding academic and conduct records, there are also scholarship opportunities, awarding a quarter to the full amount of tuition. Each semester, there are more than twenty such awards. This is truly good news for those who are ambitious. The enrollment date is the 22nd of this month.</p>
