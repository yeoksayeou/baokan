<p>社評</p>
<h3>革新政治的前提</h3>
<p>「政治」的內容與含義，似乎巳爲一般人耳熟能詳，類能道之。不　，究其實際，就是在政治圈裹的人們，也許不盡暸解。一般的說，公務人員，都是政治圈裹的人，尤其是高級的負領導責任的公務人員，對於「政治」法則，大部分未能瞭解；從然瞭解，而未能遵守，也等於未會暸解。甚　　，不但未公瞭解，未能遵守，而且反其道而行之，根本違反政治的法則。這樣的反常現象，在民國以後的歷史上隨時可舉，而於今尤爲顯署。從政者對於政治法則，尙未能瞭解；或雖能瞭解，而未能遵守，故欲政治修明，民生改善，實在戞乎難了。</p>
<p>「政治」的內容與含義，究竟是什麼呢，據孫中街先生的解釋：「政，就是衆人的事；治，就是管理。管理衆人的事，便是政治。」又說：「有管理眾人之事的力量，便是政權；今以人民管理政治，便叫做民權。」根據上面的解釋，我們知道政治的內容與含義，極爲淺顯，很易明白，並不是莫測高深，可以隱諱的事。中山先生是中華民國的締造者，國民黨的始創者，學問淵博，他的解釋，大概不會使我們懷疑，尤其是國民政府的公務人員與國民黨的同志更　不會懷疑吧！</p>
<p>當然，中山先生的解，，不過是政治內容與含義的原則的說明。政治內容的全貌，尤共是「治」—管理方面、決不是簡單的事。因此，有了「政治學」的名稱，不斷研究，不斷進步。政治學成爲十種科學。科學的範圍非常廣大，宇宙間所有一切的現象和事物，都是科學的材料。政治學的題目是國家—人羣的一種組織。政治學的目的，就是研究人與人在這種有組織的社會中之動作。所謂「政治的」，是指一切與國家有關係的種種事實，勢力和現象而言，所以政治學就是科學的國家知識，成爲一種獨立的科學。</p>
<p>粗疏一點的說，政治既然是管理衆人的事，則眾人的事，有的是共同的，有的是各異的，如何研究事件的性質？如何研究管理的方法？如何研究不同性質的事件，而用不同的方法去管理，才可以適應？凡此種種研究，當然不是膚淺所能窺探，也不是不學無術者所能急切領悟。如果說一稱利學，不從基本逐漸研究，不必窮年累月的勤慎研究，而有如中獎券，就可僥幸獲致的，那末，昨天的黃包車夫，今天不妨做工程師，昨天的泥水匠，今天就可當醫生了。天下寗有如此容易的事？退一步言，就是政治科學，與目然科學有異，並不如自然科學的嚴格，那末，今天的張三李四，不問其操何業，有何能，明天祇須　緣機會，就可以管理衆人而做官了嗎？這樣，大學校的政治科系根本不必設立，研究政治學行收學以至社會學的書籍著作都可銷燬，又何必談政治學，乾脆的倒轉數百年歷史而度專制政治的生活吧！</p>
<p>現在己經是二十世紀的時代，科學昌明，不　則退，我們的國家要求立足於當世，自然不能脫離時代而開倒車。人民是國家的主體，政治就是管理人民，管理得法，人民生活才安定。人民生活必須安定，因此，管理必須得法。而管理之是否得法，全　於操有管理之權者會否研究管理之法。簡言之，對於政治學有研究有經驗的人，才配担任政治工作。我們要求修明政治，要求改善民生，我們就須要求建立專家政治，剷除官僚政治與流氓政治。我們鑒於目前的政治現狀，與我們的要求不相符合，因此，我們不矢大聲的提出：「革新政治的前提，一是建立專家政治，二是建立民意機構」。</p>
<p>考試與鈴叙制度，是建立專家政治的基石，也是去蕪存菁的鑪篩，我們要談革新政治，要談建立專家政治，就須充分發揮考試與銓敘制度的效能，不能任其有名無實。公務人員的任用與遷調，必須經過嚴格的餘敘，如有不合標準，依法駁議。如果銓叙部的決定，無法通過，主持銓政的應認為對木身職責的侵害，依據法律提出有效申訴。如果當局對於銓政不予重視，可有可無，那末，　取信人民計，不如裁撤之。</p>
<p>因爲政治是眾人的事，在原則上講，祇能辦好，不可失敗，從政的人根本不可懷抱「鬼混」中義。我們常常聽到若干公務人員，表示「當此時會，混　算了」。旣存此種腐化心理，於是所表現於事實皆，莫非敷衍塞責，混水撈魚等等沒落現象。這種自暴自棄的公務人員，實爲造成惡劣政治的責任者，我們希望政府發揮監察與懲戒的效能，以謀肅淸。</p>
<p>共次，現代國家，政體雖異，而莫不重視民意而有民意機構，環顧當世，惟我獨無。老實說，政治上的不合理現象，在政府或許「當局者混」，可是，人民却是「旁觀者淸」，有了民意機關，人民可以不客氣的指陳得失，矯正不合理現象。因此，除非政府諱言政治上不合理現象，不願意有民意機構爲之矯正，否則不即建立民意機構，我們認爲殊無理由。</p>
<p>總之，我們迫於國家環境的緊急，人民生活的痛苦，不得不要求從革新政治入手，以連修明之境。因此，我們提出革新政治的前提，以與邦人共商之！</p>

<h3>新幾內亞島各處　激戰繼續進行中　日大本營昨發表綜合戰果</h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電日大本營二十二日下午六時發表，新幾內亞方面戰況如次；　芬希哈罕附　日軍，刻正攻擊在諸處北方登陸之敵軍中，但雙方已陸續增援。故自十月十六日以來，戰况頓呈激烈。　在　拉摩亞及拉埃附近作戰中之日軍。於重創敵軍後·卽自九月上旬起。逐次開始撤退。十月中旬，已完全集中於拉埃北方，在該期間中，敵軍所受之損害。預料將超過一萬二千餘人·日方損害，現查明約陣亡二千人，又馬當附近之日軍。自十月上旬以來，即與前開抵拉姆河上流右岸地區之敵軍交戰，刻尙在激戰中。　日陸海軍機隊連日活　甚力，除與地上部隊　力什戰外·幷猛炸敵空軍塲地，或轟炸敵軍艦艇·或邀擊來襲之敵機，自九月一日　，截至今日止。日軍所戰果如次：甲。敵軍損害。日軍擊落敵機一六四架（內未證實者十二架）。擊毀敵機五架，炸沉敵巡洋艦四艘，驅逐　二艘　運輸船一八艘，魚需艇六艘　駁船四艘及其他舟艇多艘。炸毀敵巡洋艦六艘，驅逐艦六艘。運輸船二十一艘·魚雷艇二艘，駁船五艘及舟艇多艘。乙。日方損害，僅飛機四九架。</p>
<p>里斯本二十二日中　社電據新金山來來電，日軍於芬希哈罕附近轉爲攻勢。即於密林地帶與澳軍展開激戰，傳巳　進　當距離，南北　部隊會師已成功，四南太平洋反軸心軍司令部發表戰况公報曾謂：日·澳兩軍數千人，於芬希哈罕附近密林繼續　開血戰。日軍於若干地區巳前進相當距離。又伸該司令部發言人曾說明戰况如：日軍　　距　希哈希西北十五哩薩特爾貝逆格之堅陣出擊，巳獲相當成功。且　與海岸地帶及其他日軍部隊取得連絡，並似已於索姆河沿岸稍平坦她區獲得陣地，刻正向索姆河口進擊，該地距芬希哈罕僅五哩。澳軍精銳第九師團對此正猛烈抵抗中，是役爲過去　日來最　烈之激戰，此　證日軍已抱堅固決意。</p>
<h3>緬甸日軍　展開新攻勢　蒙特巴頓飛重慶</h3>
<p>東京二十二日中央地帶企圖反攻　囘緬甸。駐緬日陸軍部隊乃先加以攻擊，現於高黎貢　山　兜等處包圍渝軍，展開壯之緬甸遠征軍刻已陷於重大危機，至渝方　之。反攻緬甸，以英印軍爲作戰主體，首先至印緬國境方面開始進攻，渝軍則與極備戰，然此次遭日軍制先奇　，已蒙受重大損害。日軍開始攻擊以來，已歷兩週，而印緬國境方面之英印軍，尙朱見有何等積極行動，致渝方內部紛紛要求英印軍即時開始作戰。據新德里來電東南亞洲反軸心軍總司令蒙特巴頓爲　蔣介石會見，巳赴重慶。終蒙特巴頓抵任後，　將　　所部緬甸遠征軍三個集團軍約二十萬　歸自己指揮之下，然遭蔣介石之拒絕，兩者關係以指揮權爲中心，愈形微妙。蒙特巴頓乃欲變更預定計劃，飛訪重慶，但因日軍展開　攻勢，緬甸戰局，急轉直下。蒙特巴頓乃遞行飛往重慶。料蒙特巴頓將與蔣介石及駐渝美軍司令官史蒂維爾等高級將官將再行全面檢討奪同緬甸之作戰計劃，並協　中國大陸戰線方面渝英美陸海空三軍之作戰計劃，調　過去成爲　案之渝軍指揮權問題等，該會談絡了後，即將開始緬甸總反攻作戰。前日軍攻略緬甸時，因英印軍單獨退　。後渝方羅卓英軍爲　等之犧牲而被日軍殲滅其後復有英印軍阿拉坎作戰之慘敗，　此種　戰連敗之戰略，敵軍旋企圖反攻，亦決無戰　云。</p>

<h3>日駐華派遣軍　發表一週戰況</h3>
<p>南京二十二日中央社電　日駐華派遣軍廿二日發表一週間戰況如次：華北日軍之積　剿共作戰，進行極為順利，因此華北各地共軍已遭受崩潰之打擊，共軍刻專避免正面作戰，彷徨於日軍掃蕩地域以外，　自日軍長期從　掃蕩以來，共軍之糧食　成困難，且兵士之逃亡層出不窮。日軍為擊滅蘇省北部　山　山兩縣之渝軍及新四軍　見，乃於十一日在中　軍警協力之下，開始掃蕩作戰，到處粉碎渝軍，並巳俘獲大批俘虜。又駐渝美空軍因屢遭日陸軍機猛炸，受創甚重，似正從事改編其空軍及　充人員器材，此種動向，與敵方最近高呼之反攻緬甸，均　注意。</p>

<h3>穩固全國力量　以爭取勝利　郭培爾撰文檢討戰局</h3>
<p>柏林二十二日中央社電　海通社訊：德國宣傳部長郭培爾博士，在最近一，之「國家雜誌」論目前戰局稱：德國利用目前之防守戰，以鞏固一般局勢，德國於遭遇軍事與政治上意外事件之結果，為穩固全國之作戰力起見，對目前局勢有詳細檢討之必要。關於過去數月來之軍事發展。渠稱：吾人最後勝利危險之程度，僅原相　之關係，若以目前之局　與一九三九年九月之局勢相較，則吾人承認戰事某階段時，最後勝利之機會較目前爲近，惟目　　勢雖較不利，但決不若戰事開始時之險惡。今夏德國在軍事上之　敗，實由於義國皇室之叛變，吾人在東　之閃避運動，亦由於此，吾人爲保護南歐起見，不得不自　綫　　若干師團，而造成縮短東綫之必要，惟局勢之危險，決不若巴特里奧變節之嚴重。此項行動使　人之戰略遭遇特別之鍛　，其結果使敵方之企圖僅達到一部份之目的。過去四月來德軍在東綫實施大規模之閃避運動，係依照原定之計劃，故秩序井然，足　　軍於戰事之第五年仍能控制局勢。實令人欽佩。郭培爾續稍：渠不欲引用「成功之撤退」一辭以為辯解·惟德軍在東线之成就略加下述。敵軍未能切斷德軍之主力或包圍德軍，更未能鹵獲大量之戰具，德國雖放棄若千領土，但並未損失大量之軍隊　戰具，德國人民之戰意亦不因戰事外表之勝敗而有升降。德國人民沈着作戰與最後勝利之決心並無絲毫之改變，　戰事幸運之盛衰，　諸人心之鎭靜，知如何以應付不幸之事件、故最後勝利之主　因素，仍在人心之穩固。德國人民鑒於一九一八年之失敗，深知此項悲劇不能垂沈於今日，故其士氣迄無動搖。邪培爾旋向德國人民保證稱：歷史上各偉大之戰事，皆與此次同，誰能忍受最久者，即可獲得最　之勝利，今日之戰事中無一國家仍能保持其全力，若德國人民滿意於今日之防守戰，則因德國之失利不足以影響戰事之決定，德國最近之挫敗，並不由於局勢之困難，乃由於德軍司令部遷就事實而已，吾人深知吾人之地位，具有暫時之脆弱點，但吾人不能忽視吾人之實力與最符勝利之機會。郭培爾之結論稱：吾人不承認吾人已喪失一部份之作戰力，敵方所獲得者，僅爲過去被吾人取得之一部份而巳，若吾人今日能振作一九三九年九月時具有之勇氣，必能繼續引用吾人之全力典對翁後勝刊之信念作戰底到。</p>
<h3>菲國會　通過兩法案</h3>
<p>馬尼剌二十二日中央社電　廿一日菲律賓特別國會通過撥款二百萬比索救濟貧民，及將菲律賓會計年度改爲自一月　至十二月止等兩項案。當即呈請總統批准。又預算委會委員長馬拉布托於　日在國會席上答覆議員阿闌斯之質間時。曾說明新政府之財政狀况。大意　至本年底止，預料將有一百三十萬比索之歲入刺餘金。</p>
<p>馬尼剌二十二日中央社電　二十二日爲菲島特別國會第五日，經審議通過關於決定通常議會二勒之法案。決定今後通常議會每年自十月廿日召開、惟本年之通常議會因己自十月十八日召開特別　會之故，乃延至十一月廿五日召開。又　憲法規定，國民議會每年召開常會一次。本年第一次常會自十一月廿五日始、連續召開六十日。</p>
<p>菲已獲得十國承認</p>
<p>馬尼剌二十二日中央社電菲律賓獨立後，正積極充實國內陣容，俾早日成爲一大東亞共榮圈內之健全國家，迄今已得承認之國家，計有中·羅地·義大利共和國及保加利亞等九國，其國際地位可謂蒸蒸日上。</p>

<p>柏林二十二日中央社電　據海通社訊：蘇軍在克里曼卓東南與諾蓋斯　草原入口攻勢之　弛，僅爲過去之現象。蘇軍在亞索夫海迤北攻勢之實弛，由於過去數日來進攻梅立托波爾重大之損失所致。至於大聶河套北段戰事之減退、由於蘇軍司令部企圖先從事於鞏固旣得之陣地，然後向南擴大其突破在聶伯河南部獲得據點，以便集中尙未使用之生力軍，蘇軍又企圖增加　河之點·亦屬可能·因目前蘇軍之渡河處距離過遙，常遭德國空軍之製擊。若謂聶伯河套與克里米亞之入口之爭奪戰，業已抵達最高度，則屬大誤。因敵方致力於擴大其勝利。而德軍司令部則　謀抑阻敵軍成功之計策。關於戰綫他處之局勢，　輔區仍在激戰中，德軍在城南進攻蘇軍橋頭，達到局部之目的，基輔以北之戰事亦巳加緊。東线中路戈美爾迤北之局勢不變，該區僅有局部之戰爭。</p>
<p>柏林二十二日中央社電　德元首行營二十一日發表東綫戰况稱：　辦軍於克里曼桌東南突破德軍陣线後，於二十日為擴大突破地區，又作局部攻　，然經激戰後已被擊退。　蘇軍為突破基輔及契尼柯夫爾市間德軍陣地。曾以數師團兵力加以猛攻，基輔北卞蘇軍攻勢失　，契尼柯夫西北仍繼續激戰中。　梅立特波爾。戈美爾兩地區及維里基魯基西南地區亦展開戰鬥。</p>
<p>南路突破戰將達最高潮</p>
<p>柏林廿二日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：在克里曼卓及尼普貝特羅夫斯克之間之突破作戰，仍在綜續進行中，前數處地點作戰之猛烈程度雖巳告略减，但並不能謂此係蘇軍作戰努力之緩弛，在相反之情勢下，此處戰　將達到另一新高潮，星期三日蘇軍之行動，係僅限於以少數之部隊，以鞏固其坦東車隊所佔領之陣地，同時蘇軍又欲擴展在南面所造成之裂口，此稱作戰行助似極不一致，故可推測係於德軍有效反攻之下，使其作戰行動足以對付德軍之壓力，以求鞏固其所獲。蘇軍在其他前綫之各區之攻勢亦有繼續，但未能顯示其重要之地點，蘇軍進攻島克關之首邑基輔，雖以數師團之新銳部隊進攻，卒被德軍所阻而告失敗。同時德軍在此區之前進確極成功，於猛烈之作戰後，德軍完成其指定之目標。因氣侯之好轉，雙方面之空中活動均極活　，德空軍利用此種優良之氣候，日夜出動襲擊蘇軍之供　线，在南面德空軍大有助於克里曼卓之戰事，以協助地面之部隊，且使敵軍人力物力均受重大損失。</p>
<h3>義南部山區　德堅強抵抗　反軸心軍攻勢遇阻</h3>
<p>柏林廿二日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：英美軍於星期三日下午在亞平靑山之中區與東區，僅以弱小之兵力，向凱塞林元帥之部隊進攻，以繼續其攻勢行動。此處與　线附近各區，以及直　西部沿海岸一帶，英美軍大半從事於整頓其部隊，蓋因敵在突破與包圍之企圖中，巳蒙受重大損失殆無疑　敵人此項行動，均在晚間進行　同　並利用黑夜以補充其部隊與　調生力軍，德軍在防禦與反攻中並皆堅强之抵抗。以及山坡地區之困雛，使反軸心司令部覺悟，在發動大規　軍事行動之前，應有特別之準備。星期三日在巴拉尼洛以南之戰事進行中、英加軍企圖沿　路綫由文契托拉向四南有所進　。另一敵軍分隊約一中隊强，同時向迤南數公里之山　發動進攻，但德軍由奎裏那小溪上之爪爾地亞里傑亞兩旁發出集中之防禦砲火。使上述二處敵之猛攻。均在短時間內崩潰，損失軍大。德　彈兵立即發動反攻，江擒獲不少戰俘，曾在卡斯德取諾獲得增援之英軍一中隊，在亞平寗山之東坡亦遭遇類似之命運，此處敵軍亦被擊退至原陣地，在戰塲上遺下不少死傷之兵士。</p>
<h3>德國又發明新武器火箭炸彈威力驚人</h3>
<p>柏林二十二日中央社電　英首相邱吉爾曾於九月二十一日在下院宣布：德軍刻正研究新式滑翔機與新式火翦炸彈等新兵器。世界軍事專家獲知後，深爲　驚。茲德國「干預報曾於二十日於封面　載照片兩幀，爲德軍需部長施別爾與美爾赫元帥隱身放鐵楯之後，實驗新式炸彈威力情形，此已確認英首相　言非虛。該報曾於照片之旁，加以說明　，德空軍部長戈林將軍及軍需部長施別爾博士近曾召集軍需工業界要人多名，在東线某機塲實騐新式兵器，結　良好，擬最近即將　使用於前线，對於炸彈之威力未曾說明，僅謂其可擊燬要塞。爲一特殊炸彈，且德軍當局對此亦不願詳加說明，故其實情不得而知。另　反軸心方面之消息稱：該新式炸彈長約一米。爲一火箭式之炸彈，其兩側附有如　之　，故一經發射，即　滑　機向前平飛，時　為五百哩或六百哩。丘吉爾曾謂，該新式炸彈之發射恐係以無线電操縱。惟英美　國軍事專家認其形體極小。除裝以多重之炸藥外，實雛附以無綫電操縱裝置，故邱氏所言未必可靠。聞該炸彈能自距離目標一哩許之處發射，故可謂係一種空中魚雷。另悉德機所置之機關砲以及高射砲，亦係用火箭式之　彈。故衆認將來之炸彈，頗有改用火翦式之可能。現德國國民以希特勒前曾預言德機將對英國作報復轟炸，故均期待德國能大量製造此種新兵器，早日開始轟炸英國以資報復。</p>
<h3>日本强化國內態勢</h3>
<p>教育制度刷新</p>
<p>作爲澈底的强化國民動員之重要的一環而實施的，關於敎育態勢之全面改造的許多措置，自然是出於欲應付目前重大局面的決斷。鑒於　制改革以來日本文教政策的趨向，及教育界一　與論的動向，這是應有的結果。</p>
<p>此次的措置、乃欲把學生的總力重新配置於國家重要部門的應急措置，日本敎宵界的懸　之一、卽打破大學並高等敎育的非計劃性，一切障碍得因此而一舉解決。在期待敎育之國家計劃的滲透上，以刷新文敎爲目標而生長發展·日本的敎育在應付這空前的戰局上乃有急角的轉變。</p>
<p>因戰局的迫切。由於先前的確立學生戰時動員體制要綱，把敎室置於廣泛現實的國民生活之中，以期　備在實行中求學的適應決戰時行政的態勢。使日本教育在　態勢上更有效地確保強力的計劃性和實行性。今　迅速的展開，在日。教育態　上劃一新紀元，誠堪刮目相視。以下試就此次措置之主要者來　其具體的意義。</p>
<p>第一，一般人最所注視的是停止兵役展緩徵果，如在以前，展　徵集被視爲一程特典，不能無弊，但這種謬見，在現正進行中的改革學制的根本理念上被　除了。且現在又因此次的措置。而具體的明示了其不對的地方。</p>
<p>兵役和學生</p>
<p>兵役和學生生活的關係。基於國家教育計劃始予以規定。在兵役方面，需要多少數目，又在生　方面，需要多少受過何種教育程度的學生，這是　訂國家要員養成計劃目標的結果，所以出征的，殘剩於學校中的，同樣是根據國家的需要而規定。</p>
<p>所以此次之　文科法科學生立即應軍國之急者，乃爲符應國軍所需要的兵員數之增大這至上的要求。一方面，從敎育的見地出發，專攻文科法科，乃所謂修身洽人之學，在這時候，把學生生活，暫時中斷，使執戈上戰塲，母寗說是養成指導人材的真正方法。</p>
<p>基於這種國家要員的養成計劃，繼停止徵用展緩期間的第二種措置，即理工科學校的　備擴充，及法文科大學教育的停止。再次而又發展成爲法文科大學專門學校的整理統一這第三措置。目前日本學校系統的形式上最大的缺點，對敎育缺乏明確的國家計劃性。即建立適合國家需要的敎育計劃之努力，在以前的敎育政策上，是素不注意的，結果，養成的指導人才呢？大學及高等專門學校不能充分適應國家之現實的要求。其弊在私立大學的敎育上表現得最為　厚。</p>
<p>據最近的文部省調查。在昭各十七年，有公立大學廿一校。而私立爲二七校。專門學校公立者四〇校，私立一一七校。學生數亦以私立學校爲多，從統計上看來，反占主體的地位。那許多私立學校的大部份，其前身乃是在法律學校時代·以至往年自由主　經濟時代之問所膨　以法文科爲中心的狀態，繼續存在至於今日。現在國家所迫切要求理工科學生之養成，在經管方面，私立的自然不能像公立的一樣易於實行。據文部省所調查昭和十七年度入學者數，公立的法文科大學四四％．高專二八％．理工科大學五六％，高專七二％，而在私立學校方面，法文科大學八五％，高專七七％，理工科大學一五％。高專二三％。</p>
<p>教育上的浪費</p>
<p>文部省當局常聲明目前的理想案乃是法文科三，理工科七的比率，但現在的情形顯然離這理想甚遠。這是敎育上重大的浪費，國家所屬望於每一靑年學生者極大，且在計劃經濟之下，爲建立養成國家要員計劃　不僅有從速斷然改編這些學校的必要，且這些私立學校的講師及其他敎員的經費來源，大多仰冰求政府機關，所以從經營上的立塲出發，不能自行解決集中都市之弊。現在二七家私立大學中束京十九家，京都·大阪·神戶七家·專門學校一一七家中，東京六九家，京都·大阪·神·二六家，幾全部集中於都市，從防衛國土的見地看來，這事實亦雛以看過。</p>
<p>關於學校的改編，第一應注意的是文理　重的修正，和防空措置上學校校舍的　理疎散。同時，要求各學校此時檢討本身的內容，掃除學校系統上　的病根之學校數過多之弊。</p>
<p>除上述外，此次年措置所注目的，是八的制義務敎育的延期。驟視之此舉似乎具有敎育上消極的意義，但現行的國民學校高等科，祇因未實施義務制而依然繼續，乃在學常科上，脫離國民學校，男子有入學全部靑年學校的普通科之義務，如再配以靑年學校教育的刷新，則在敎育効果上，不致於成爲問題。（翔：　自九月二十八日西部朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>美眾院密會　軍事長官　報告戰局　戒國人勿過樂觀</h3>
<p>阿根廷京二十二日中央社電　美軍參謀總長馬歇爾等·二十一日曾出席衆院秘密會議，對約四百名議員，力言戰局之的途不可樂以觀。茲美聯社華盛頓電報，就此秘密會議之內容報稱：參謀總長馬歇爾曾就一般戰略報告約四十分鐘，繼之為准將阿多斯特倫之轟炸德本土作戰報告。陸長史汀生亦曾披　其所見·彼曾力言珍珠灣以來。戰局演變之嚴重·並希將　局實况轉告國人，以戒其過度之樂觀。此外美聯社復舉列軍當局之五項報告內容如次</p>
<p>日軍實力不容輕視</p>
<p>美太平洋戰线，卽　獲得對日軍作戰之空軍　地，但因日軍於鄰近地點備有極有力之部隊。故結果反軸心軍仍不能防衛此等基地。　以德空軍最近作大舉出動。即謂其空軍巳見弱化，實爲謬　，蓋德空軍之此種狀態。實不外爲未來作戰而培養其空軍兵力。　日軍需工業之飛機生產，補充其空軍損失而有餘。　人力不足問題，僅美國有之，日本尚朱動員十七歲至二十歲之壯丁，日本殆無人力不足問題。　英美商船隊因軸心潛艇之活躍，損失甚大，更因登陸作戰損失艦隊甚多，故運輸間題實乃反軸心之重要問題，而飛機又尚未到　可代船舶從事運　之程度。</p>
<p>蘇聯不諳兩樓戰術</p>
<p>里斯本二十二日</p>
<p>中央社電　據華盛頓電：美參謀總長馬歇爾將軍在國會之秘密會議中稱，蘇聯一再要求開闢歐洲第二戰线，顯然末曾了解兩樓戰略之技術問題，蘇聯低估此等軍事行動之困雛，而英美兵十則巳於北菲西西里義大利及汰平洋之戰事中得到艱苦之經驗。</p>
<p>馬歇爾將調任新職</p>

<p>莫斯科會議第三日情形</p>
<p>里斯本廿二日中央社電　據倫敦報告稱：英美報界駐莫斯科訪員謂，在英美代表心目中，莫斯科三國會議之第三日　有滿意之進展，惟該訪員等並未提出蘇聯是否亦對第三日會議之結果有滿意之感。此日會議中軍事專家多人，復參加討論，散會時甚早，因美國務卿赫爾巳深感疲勞，無力繼續討論也。路透社駐莫斯科特派員金氏報告，謂蘇方堅持軍事問題之討論，應列爲議程中之第一要點，而英美代表團似在此點已以壓力施諸蘇方。更有甚者嚴力施諸蘇方。更有甚者，莫斯科方面於聆悉南非聯邦首相斯末資將軍所稱第二戰綫未能於本年內成立之討論後，大感失望。英美各報駐莫斯科訪員　雖暗示蘇聯與英美代表團有軍事問題上之異見，然彼等反覆表示，此會議能採取一協調之途徑，並希冀能獲得具體之結果。惟英美方面之報告中，對於計劃中之邱羅斯三氏之會晤，始終朱有隻字述及。</p>
<p>瑞典京城廿二日中央社電　據海通社訊：倫敦每日電聞報稱，莫科斯會議可與未來派之繪畫比較，吾人可寄若干希望與艾登，渠曾宣稱三國會議將　戰局提早結束。</p>

<h3>記者盃足球賽　僑聯勝聯誼　三比二上半時三比零</h3>
<p>本市新聞記者公會為籌募福利基金舉辦之足球賽，昨下午四時假逸　球塲隆重舉行，陳市長特派梁宣傳處長秀予主持開球禮，市商會袁理事長　登，特派程秘書志良主持給獎禮·觀者不下數千餘人盛況空前熱烈。兩次　球購賣由餘慶主人女公子，及鼎大鐵行主謝家麟先生令媛，各斥資五萬元　去，熱心本會福利事業，殊堪欽佩。球賽結果聯誼以一球之差·三對二為　聯奏凱·上半時僑聯三比〇佔先·</p>
<p>僑聯刀劈三關</p>
<p>準處長行閉球禮·後僑聯開始進攻，五分鐘時，福恩交法凡笑·十碼處猛射時，顯漢撲救不及·球門昭落，一此〇僑聯先施下馬威。聯誼反攻，球運不濟，約未成功。二十五分鐘時，儒聯飾格夫殺出血路，法凡笑又發雄風，拚力一射。劉顯漢不防冷飾，又告失守。二比〇　誼將十惜无不助人，均差諸亳厘，　五分鐘時，一潑利霍特　潘脫遜二人。左右齊飛。近聊誼門前二十碼處·潘脫遜勾送　剎翟將·　斜射又告中的，三比〇僑聯運下三成。此時聯誼平義臣發揮九牛　虎之力，單刀直入，無功而返·阿奎亦數度臨空妙射球運不濟，上半時僑聯三比〇領先。</p>
<p>聯誼奪回二城</p>
<p>拍　擊球後，　軍再戰，職誼欲　前恥。大　軍容，加强前養攻勢·吳祺祥出任左輔，阿奎改任左異，昭鵬退守左前衛。永福調右，英權振充右後衛，軍容大振，僑聯亦調將陣棧，納夫柯出替獲利霍特，雪而佛調出耶少山，兩隊均聲勢昻昻。聯誼進攻，聲勢陶洵·惟球渾仍屬不濟，義臣力射，擦右柱斜出後，阿　臨時妙勾·又被滯里曼候個正卷。約二十分鐘時，小費邊疆直入，與近門時，僑聯許爾茲搶球心急，手觸賽球·判罰十二碼球，宋靈聖操刀，直入左下角，聯誼紀錄乃開。聯館有中興氣象，不動分鐘後，小高舉足力叩。許爾茲及時趕到，潘里曼同時衝出被據，李義臣天外飛來，加上一脚·打入空門·三比二聯誼情勢轉佳。此後滿探再造紀錄，無奈時不待人·乃以三比二以一球之差　北。</p>

<h3>日陸軍發言人談　緬甸反攻作戰</h3>
<p>中央社訊日陸軍報道部發會人，於昨日在定期會　記者席上，就反軸心軍之緬旬反攻作戰，發表談話稱：目前反軸心軍對於緬旬反攻作戰，似躍躍必欲一試。本年初夏，反軸心軍企圖奪囘日溪，展開反攻作戰，結果仍告失敗，此予反軸心國，尤以渝方之影饗殊爲深刻，印度人輕視英國之觀念，亦因之加深，印度獨立運動遂益見昂禍。</p>
<p>蒙氏抵印</p>
<p>攻克緬甸，重開緬旬公路一舉，無論就其名譽方面。或就今後之繼續對日反攻作戰方而，均勢在必行，自東南亞細亞反軸心軍司令官蒙脫巴頓中將　於本月七日行抵新德里以來，渝方劉於反攻緬甸之論調，頓轉活潑，不時發表希望憲身。據傳蒙脫巴頓於十六日偕同政治顧問蓋士維克等到達重慶，十八日以來，迭在蔣介石山荘塡蔣會晤，至二十一日始離渝返任，當時係與蔣說明新德里會議所決定之亞細亞反攻作戰計劉，並强要渝軍作最大犧牲，當不待言。此次會議，渝方對於東南亞細亞軍司令部統帥權及作戰方針所抱之不滿。究竟巳否在著干緩和，寶無法探悉</p>
<p>渝報論調</p>
<p>據十八日渝方大公報論稱：囘緬旬作戰，由前日溪件戰聽受之敎訓而覩，實不能郢持陸上作戰、必須仰光克拉地峽馬來半烏之登陸作戰，同時併發云”又渝軍事委員會機關報描蕩報，十九日戰稱：全面調整東亞反攻作戰，先須重開緬旬公路·其理由　攻擊新加坂硃為困難，　欽全面調整東南亞細亞作載，實有牽制在華日軍必要，是以先須重關緬甸公路以確保對渝軍之補給。大公報力主採取多角形作戰，而掃蕩報則始終强調緬旬第一主義，此種見解上之不同，傳在九月上旬所召開之北溫泉會議中，業已飾分暴露。</p>
<p>內部意見</p>
<p>渝方內部意見之劉立，前由此可得一明證。瑜重最高軍事當局，於今卷編成緬旬遠征軍、由　六戰區司令　誠任司令，窺何反攻緬甸機會，遠征軍傳係由杜孝明之第五　區軍·　　後之第九　團軍，宋希濂之第十一。駐緬日派遣軍察知渝軍企養、於十月上旬突自雲南有境茫市，龍陵。騰越三方面開始進軍，一舉即將盤　於滇緬公路東端北方山　地帶　築堅同陣地，企圖頑强抵抗之渝軍三十六師宋務鑰所部一　五千兵力·加以完全包圍，展開　威戰。</p>
<p>突入怒江</p>
<p>十七日突入怒江渡過，之粟柴壩。日軍各部隊急追淪方收軍·繼續北向職川河谷進學。渝方宣傳部長梁家操，於二十日會見記者時，曾發表極悲觀　明細稱：日方　增强駐緬旬及演西之日軍兵力，金關攻擊中國或印度，然截至日前止·日軍尙未進抵怒江東最云。反軸心軍企圖於印緬國境展開作戰後。同時發動滇地作戰，以分散日軍兵力·然在戰事未曾展圖之　，渝軍即告一收鑰地，予彼等作戰前途以一重大黑影·尤　渝方狼狽之甚，更不難想像也。</p>
<h3>廣田部長　談印度問題</h3>
<p>中央社訊　日本在　報道書局聯合招待席上，日本大使館廣田情報部長，昨（廿二）向我國記老團（關於印度問題）發表談話如次：昨天十月廿一日，江特拉鮑斯在昭南易就任印度臨時政府一事·敝人以日小人的立塲上說是可敬可欣之事。</p>
<p>印度文化</p>
<p>印度白勒百年來，受莫注葡三國之侵略，於不斷壓迫之下，繼續生活。其議千年來已具有如哲學，宗教，美術等高水準之文化，即現在說來，印度悶於此種文化仍有　高度之水準。至於對現代印度之文化，如有不療解者，遵一定是他們受英國方面宣傳之結果，而使他完令不理解印度文化之本質。最近三百年間，印度雖在輩國之統治之下·出現已以其自身文化之覺悟為基礎，為謀　水身之飾立，而恢復其政　、完成印度三萬　五千萬民素之宿望。對於印度能成立統一之印度臨時政府一帶·務人就束亞民族之復興上說。眞右很大的力量·且於東亞民族之　展及東亞文化夕交涉上，實以有具大的奇興。</p>
<p>特別意義</p>
<p>關於印度臨時政府之成立，據本人推想其中含中種雜特別之意義·茲分述如下，第一，此次印度政府之建立，在印度歷史上。為第一次統一之政府。第二，四百年以前所失去的印度的成立於四白年　的今日·才恢復起來·第三，此獨立即於東亞民族自身，力下能成功的事實。　於江特拉鮑斯一　的工作，在　方曾特別予以援助，此為我人所不應忘記的事實·印度獨會後我們在束亞的獨立國家　算起來·在大東亞　爭發生以後所獨立的國家·有緬旬，非律質。印度三國、在大東亞戰爭發生以前，已有中國日本滿洲國泰國等四國·此七國今後團結起來·足以擊被反軸心。視印度臨時政府·以　統　之印人自己的軍隊。來參加作戰，我想在印度之獨文上是含有特別探該的意義的，所以在印度民族之獨立上，予以竭力援助，此為我人所應負之責任，自不待言。</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>獎勵國民儲蓄</h3>
<p>經濟學家之忍欲說，實為經濟思想中極有價值的學　·　認忍欲與　本之搆成·具有密切關係：資太搆成必一部傳由於資水家　其現在之享樂，一部份由於責　家節異不生產之他用：此項原質，就　享樂與不生產的消費，與勞力之犧牲相同。皆為眼制生　的阻力，因此。我們感覺現今獎勵國民　選遠動，寶睛與經選學家之忍欲學說相符合。</p>
<p>獎勵國民備審，自政府立塲會·可實收囘通貨，自人民立場言　足以節約　費·不可以不說果戰時體制下一個最有意義的運動·因此·以本年七月初發行之特別儲蓄獎券·及九月底舉行之定期有獎儲蓄遠為獎勵國民儲蓄的試騐以來·從其後者·有近日在京舉行的　勵國民儲蓄週；京市各行荘現正忙於收欵工作，並據一般俗測，其儲蓄成績當不　淤上　、此外·蘇州，杭州·蚌埠三地，亦將分別推行。由此看來，獎勵國民儲蓄業巳形成舉國一致的普通運動了</p>
<p>原來·儲蓄就是節約，節約方能儲蓄。如今，獎勵儲蓄興提倡節約兩個連動，在並行不背之中，雙聲齊下，其眞切意義，還不是在於勸導戰時民眾抑制個人的欲　，節省一部的消費，以實獻於增加生產的途徑·這樑一個意義的領會·現巳逐漸普及於社會各階層，因此，運咖啡館與舞塲業·在素來提倡不節約的立塲上，居然也於日昨開起座談會，互商節約問題了！</p>

<p>大豆</p>
<p>大　產蹈係以蚌埠為中心·去年運　二十萬袋（每袋一百基羅），　年收獲·或能　到此數，惟因最近淮水增漲·堤聲頗多決潰，故對大豆出壓上頗有重大影響，一前途未可樂　。</p>
<p>大麥</p>
<p>淮河一帶，亦為大麥重要產區，其收獲亦與大豆同樣受淮水災害影響·惟華中地區一般情說，可稱良好，可能收棧四萬噸至五萬噸之間。</p>

<h3>華股趨勢</h3>
<p>昨華股堅定淮恒·在優勢買氣中，各股續向高峯挺進，中途雖時有零星散多護利吐售，然金融界及各幫仍有力吸收·美亞綱廠興康元製罐軋漲最多·其他各業股亦莫不跟鐘躍上，交易日旺，今分誌各情於後。</p>
<p>紡織永安紡織盤旋趨昇，大生三廠下挫，中紡榮　各升半級，信和亦題之做高，美亞求過於供，大公染轍天輪絲織亦升·新豐·渝擊亦均做高，安甡織造交　市平，景　彩　續　挺升，景綸亦見戴高。</p>

<p>地陸在買勢中躍上，永與進提者最殷，新益亦見做高。</p>
<p>文化中華與世界各見做小，商務尙平：永鮮印書。標準紙品向種穩定。</p>
<p>金融成交淸稀，價亦穩定，大陸上海浙興金減　業之買資價仍在前日價左右，然未接近。</p>

<p>米糧米市到貨依然絕跡。零星雖塲初平後呆，散戶仍有採辦，人心向上，早市先升，繼略同降，但終較前日軋升，雜糧形勢，無何榮辱。</p>

<p>日前在本報「社會服務」攔內·看載有二則食砂致疾的事實。因此，戶口米雜貿妨礙健　，巳有事實許明了。聽說此種雜質不但能使言勝發炎，尚能引起　他種種腸胃病症·妨礙人體消化機能·使健康蒙受莫大損害。</p>
<p>戶口米雜質既如此右害，當然應該设法除去才好。現在，讓我們追大溯源·先探求一下米中雜質之由來。</p>
<p>米中本無雜質，即右，市中是偶然有一些，決不會　麼多。無疑地；雜質非天然雜在米中，而是由人攙進者。戶口米由常局所配給，我們想，民為那本，明攙的當局當然不會為了少數人的利益·攙入如計雜質　危害人民。因此，有人　，或　是米商攙進去的吧，一般黑心商人為了漁利，常常見利忘義·不顧他人。</p>
<p>不過，無論是米商攙入，或是　有其他原因，此物既有害健康，我們決小能再漠視了。</p>
<p>為了全滬數千萬市民的幸福，筆者以極大誠意，希望當局從速查出米中雜實之來·而加以嚴格取締，想當局關懷民皮，當不河漢斯言。（江　）</p>
<p>米糧庫券</p>
<p>前報戰收　米糧時將發行米緝庫券。筆者不敏願進一么言，以為常局的　者</p>
<p>此次準備發行米糧庫券，在當局者固有其苦衷；不過為防止關於幣制的流言以及為農民本身著想計，似平很有應加注意的地方。農村經儕，誰也不　　　的，其　動　力　有限得很的，上古時道能物物交易，際此貨幣逝行之日。　遠　興去榦那不們得極的玩意兌呢？既如此，貨幣在農村也右和在那市一樣　零零。假使以米糧庫　　為米糧的代價，就必　竭力　法增强其麻痹性，　是米糧庫券而失知其流通性·那麽米糧　　貝將讚到憲料之中。　礙·而且是無法打破的陪礙。因為　　米　庫券不能流通，或者流通性較通貨為弱，那麽農民雖至嚴者也不會把可吃而　　的米　夫掉　不能流通　庫券的（試想米）為　民的生產品，　是以民　　命綫，如何肯輕易拋出而易以一紙庫券？農民拒絕出賣米　，壹非對糧政的一大打擊？願常局考慮及之。（氓）</p>
<p>煤球黑市曲來</p>
<p>近日市上最感困難的，莫非煤球一項·難黑市尤　無處雖買，若有，亦須預購·非俟　二三天不可。且所得之媒球，非類煤球，竇同泥石一般，全無「燃料」可謂·若順其長此以往·全市市民將有斷炊之一天，故已　為刻不容緩之事矣。</p>
<p>然事實之造成。總有一番經過，在一般光面戳來，總以為廠方及零售商作祟·故意乘火打劫抬高黑市，欲知法律人人皆長，原非一輩所顧冒犯，且其中奧妙之成因，決非普通人所能明瞭，故往於此猜測聲浪中來一個澈底之分析。</p>
<p>製造廠商之主要原料為無姻煤屑，來白當局之配給，其價格約每噸三百元，所　混合之泥士及雜實，由自己購買亦值戰十元，再加製造費二百元，總計成本為五百元，當局　以之　　利　五十無，故出　　已　每噸五百五十元，此枇價為上半牛當局公偽製價迄今。而主原料配給之價格，亦　當局之實宏從未增加。豈料最近廠方因受買物易景之故·致開支浩　·日機器　　費一項·尤為　繚，而所得利潤　增·故成入不敷出，勢難維持之勞，後雖曾一度向當局　求提高限價，但總因理由　為不充分作罷，糧　廠方　相增加零售商之車力，由每噸二十元，升至六十元·後又麽次為當局等求，但結，濟遭拒絕·廠方事後庭老羞成怒，變本加利，　行減少　量·藉口修理停工　及增多雜貿等間接反抗情形。並暗地實使黑市交易·造成每噸達八百餘元之譜，故旋即造成今之黑市矣。</p>
<p>其次論列零售商之處境，零售商之煤球當然批自廠方，考向來之枇價每噸為五百五十元，加上車力二十元，當　之限價定每　三十二元五角，計合一噸為六百五十元，若每日能銷售一噸，則賺毛錢八十元，再除煤屑之損失，故祇凈賺六十元矣。試問此區區之利潤，能否維持一店之開支。況能銘售　二噸以上老有幾家·由此可知其日清苦非凡矣·豈知近日廠方又變相增高東力到六十元。無形使零售曲又減低利潤四十元，再加近日廠方更右兩口停頓·及減少產量　行動，致使零售商每日　到之煤球祇減到四分之一或零，否則祇有向廠方黑市搜　，以維持開支，試問此為情況能不能免除造成黑市之成因？而零售商所蒙不自之冤，有何處可伸苦呢？</p>
<p>以上之情形，寶為造成媒球黑市及恐慌之起因，亳無坦辯何方，因本人為業中人，且易歷其境，故所知頗詳，並深望當局急應徹查黑市造成根派，重行考慮兩方最低　潤，另一方　則麽處置廠方無故藉口停工，威少產量及偷運閑利（如報載某大公司之倫運）等不法行動，是　媒球之黑市及恐慌將自形消　矣·最後，本人認為凡欲平定一物，必須起　根本對症下葉，並　祇壓表面即能成就，例如洪水之氾濫，不在設法開拓支流，而去築高提岸·由其後果將不球設想矣。（吏小人）（移酬助學）</p>
<p>改善捲姻配給</p>
<p>關於改善　給方注的文字和餘調很多，不過大多著重於治表辦法，不外是嚴厲緝杳·請市民檢舉等等。雖然當局如此的風行雷厲，商號仍藝把一枇一批配給品　出後門，輸銷給攤販·或運往外埠·變成黑貨·因之發一筆大財。市民　什慶證據可能檢舉，緝查　成虛話了。話雖如此話，我並不反對這種辦法，但我以為應當用相當的治根方法，相輔而行，那未收效來得優善。</p>
<p>現在我們以捲烟來懿：和給烟一批，由那給機關配給出來，可是配給烟軋到的人其數少得實在可憐。以整個的配給數量而言，並不能說少。但是為什麽軋烟軋　到的人這樣少。以我所知大約有下列二原因：</p>
<p>商號在配給時，聲不多以十分之二配給民眾，其餘十分之八　然以黑市售出。</p>
<p>十分之二的配給量，還是被平日熟悉認識的人買去，容中或有一人　二包的人。</p>
<p>基於上述的原因·統制　給被這種專圖私利的奸商破壊了，華中姻草酬給組合有蠶於此，邃創議把配給烟的錫紙及紙包拆下退還，以杜絕流弊，然而試聞假使有攤販或商店以黑價售給你一束散裝的捲姻，你憑什慶去檢舉！而況過去更有大量的捲姻。錫紙和紙包流存在外，弊端百出，所以還不是一個良好的辦法。</p>
<p>最好在煙捲及紙包上印就配給的字樣，一方强迫登記存貨，將存貨亦限期印上配給字樣，否則不　出售，再加緝查和檢舉的工作，則可根絕流弊。這樣不論在鄕鎭或城市，如發現黑市，任何人都可檢舉，當局也便於緝查。在戰時物資統制緊張關頭，其他物資的統制配給，也可參照如此辦法，斟酌辦理，　莞之見，不知當局容納否？（疾非）</p>

        <h1>1943.10.23</h1>
<h3>The Premise of Political Reform</h3>
<p>The content and meaning of "politics" seem to be well-known to the general public, and they can all talk about it. However, in reality, even those in political circles may not fully understand it. Generally speaking, public officials are all within the political circle, especially high-ranking public officials with leadership responsibilities. Most of them fail to understand the laws of "politics"; even if they do understand, failing to abide by them is equivalent to not understanding. What's more, not only do they fail to understand and abide by them, but they go against them, fundamentally violating the laws of politics. Such abnormal phenomena have been readily apparent in the history of the Republic of China, and are particularly evident today. Those engaged in politics have not been able to understand the laws of politics; or even if they can understand them, they have not been able to abide by them, so it is really difficult to achieve political clarity and improve people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>What exactly is the content and meaning of "politics"? According to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's explanation: "Politics is the matter of the public; governance is management. Managing the affairs of the public is politics." He also said, "The power to manage the affairs of the public is political power; now, having the people manage politics is called democracy." Based on the above explanation, we know that the content and meaning of politics are extremely simple and easy to understand, and are not unfathomable matters that can be concealed. Mr. Sun Yat-sen was the creator of the Republic of China and the founder of the Kuomintang. His knowledge was profound, and his explanation probably would not make us doubt, especially the public officials of the National Government and the comrades of the Kuomintang, even less so, right?</p>
<p>Of course, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's explanation is only a principle-based explanation of the content and meaning of politics. The full picture of the content of politics, especially the "governance"—the management aspect—is by no means a simple matter. Therefore, there is the name "political science," which is constantly being researched and constantly progressing. Political science has become a kind of science. The scope of science is very broad, and all phenomena and things in the universe are materials for science. The topic of political science is the state—a kind of organization of people. The purpose of political science is to study the actions of people in this organized society. What is called "political" refers to all kinds of facts, forces, and phenomena related to the state, so political science is the scientific knowledge of the state and becomes an independent science.</p>
<p>To put it crudely, since politics is the management of the affairs of the public, some of the affairs of the public are common and some are different. How to study the nature of events? How to study methods of management? How to study events of different natures and manage them with different methods to adapt? All these kinds of research are certainly not something that can be glimpsed superficially, nor can they be quickly understood by those who are uneducated and unskilled. If it is said that politics is like winning the lottery, without gradually studying the basics, without diligently studying for years, then yesterday's rickshaw puller might as well be an engineer today, and yesterday's plasterer could be a doctor today. How can there be such easy things in the world? Taking a step back, even if political science is different from natural science and not as strict as natural science, then can today's Zhang San and Li Si, regardless of their occupation or abilities, manage the public and become officials tomorrow simply by chance? If so, there is no need to set up political science departments in universities at all, and books and writings on political science, even sociology, can be destroyed. Why talk about political science? Just simply turn back hundreds of years of history and live a life of autocratic politics!</p>
<p>Now is already the era of the 20th century, and science is flourishing. If you don't advance, you will fall behind. If our country wants to stand in the world, it naturally cannot break away from the times and go backward. The people are the main body of the country, and politics is the management of the people. If managed properly, the people's lives will be stable. The people's lives must be stable, therefore, management must be proper. Whether management is proper depends entirely on whether those who wield the power of management have studied the method of management. In short, only those who have studied and have experience in political science are qualified to take on political work. If we want to clarify politics and improve people's livelihoods, we must demand the establishment of expert politics and eliminate bureaucratic politics and gangster politics. In view of the current political situation, which does not conform to our requirements, we cannot help but loudly propose: "The premise of political reform is, first, to establish expert politics, and second, to establish organs of public opinion."</p>
<p>The examination and evaluation system is the cornerstone of establishing expert politics, and also the sieve for removing the dross and retaining the essence. If we want to talk about political reform and the establishment of expert politics, we must fully exert the effectiveness of the examination and evaluation system, and cannot let it exist in name only. The appointment and transfer of public officials must undergo strict evaluation, and if they do not meet the standards, they should be rejected in accordance with the law. If the decision of the Ministry of Personnel cannot be passed, the person in charge of personnel administration should consider it an infringement of their own responsibilities and file an effective appeal according to the law. If the authorities do not value personnel administration and consider it dispensable, then, for the sake of gaining the trust of the people, it is better to abolish it.</p>
<p>Because politics is the matter of the public, in principle, it can only be done well and cannot fail. Those engaged in politics must not harbor a "muddling through" mentality. We often hear some public officials say, "At this time, just muddle along." Having such a corrupt mentality, all that is manifested in reality is nothing more than perfunctory work, muddling the waters to fish for personal gain, and other decadent phenomena. These self-abandoning public officials are truly responsible for creating bad politics, and we hope that the government will exert the effectiveness of supervision and discipline to seek purification.</p>
<p>Secondly, although the political systems of modern countries differ, all of them attach importance to public opinion and have organs of public opinion. Looking around the world, only we do not have them. To be honest, the irrational phenomena in politics may be "muddled through" by the government, but the people are "clear bystanders." With organs of public opinion, the people can frankly point out gains and losses and correct irrational phenomena. Therefore, unless the government avoids talking about irrational phenomena in politics and is unwilling to have organs of public opinion to correct them, there is no reason not to establish organs of public opinion immediately.</p>
<p>In short, compelled by the urgency of the national environment and the suffering of the people's lives, we cannot help but demand to start with political reform to achieve a state of clarification. Therefore, we propose the premise of political reform to discuss it with the people of the country!</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting Continues in Various Parts of New Guinea Island; Japanese Headquarters Announced Comprehensive Battle Results Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced the following situation of the battle in New Guinea at 6:00 p.m. on the 22nd: The Japanese army near Finschhafen is currently attacking the enemy forces that have landed in the north of various places, but both sides have successively reinforced their forces. Therefore, since October 16th, the battle situation has suddenly become fierce. The Japanese army fighting near Lae and Laemoia, after heavily damaging the enemy forces, began to retreat gradually from the beginning of September. In mid-October, they had completely concentrated in the north of Lae. During this period, the damage suffered by the enemy forces is expected to exceed 12,000 people. The Japanese side's losses are currently known to be about 2,000 killed in action. In addition, the Japanese army near Madang has been fighting with the enemy forces that arrived in the upstream right bank area of the Ramu River since the beginning of October, and fierce fighting is still ongoing. The Japanese army and navy air units have been very active in recent days. In addition to fighting fiercely with the ground troops, they have also bombed enemy airfields, bombed enemy warships, or intercepted attacking enemy aircraft. From September 1st to today, the Japanese army's battle results are as follows: A. Enemy forces' losses: The Japanese army shot down 164 enemy aircraft (including 12 unconfirmed), destroyed 5 enemy aircraft, sank 4 enemy cruisers, 2 destroyers, 18 transport ships, 6 torpedo boats, 4 barges, and many other boats. Destroyed 6 enemy cruisers, 6 destroyers, 21 transport ships, 2 torpedo boats, 5 barges, and many boats. B. The Japanese side's losses were only 49 aircraft.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a telegram from San Francisco, the Japanese army near Finschhafen has turned to the offensive, and fierce fighting has broken out with the Australian army in the dense forest area. It is reported that they have advanced a considerable distance, and the meeting of the north and south troops has been successful. The headquarters of the anti-Axis forces in the South Pacific issued a war bulletin stating that thousands of Japanese and Australian troops are continuing to engage in bloody battles in the dense forests near Finschhafen. The Japanese army has advanced a considerable distance in some areas. Furthermore, a spokesman for the said headquarters explained the battle situation as follows: The Japanese army launched an attack from the strong position of Sattelberg, 15 miles northwest of Finschhafen, and has achieved considerable success. Moreover, they have established contact with coastal areas and other Japanese army units, and seem to have gained a position in the slightly flatter area along the Som River, and are currently advancing towards the mouth of the Som River, which is only five miles from Finschhafen. The elite 9th Division of the Australian army is fiercely resisting this, and this battle is the fiercest in the past few days. This proves that the Japanese army has a firm determination.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Burma Launches New Offensive; Mountbatten Flies to Chongqing</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Attempting to counterattack and return to Burma. The Japanese army stationed in Burma first launched an attack and is now besieging the Chongqing army in Gaoligong Mountain and other places, launching a heroic battle. The Chongqing expeditionary force in Burma is now facing a major crisis. As for the Chongqing side's counterattack against Burma, the British Indian army is the main force in the operation, and it first began to attack the border between India and Burma. The Chongqing army is fully prepared for battle, but this time it was preempted by the Japanese army and has suffered heavy losses. Since the Japanese army began its attack, two weeks have passed, and the British Indian army on the border between India and Burma has not yet shown any positive action, which has caused internal demands within Chongqing for the British Indian army to start fighting immediately. According to a telegram from New Delhi, Lord Mountbatten, Commander of the Anti-Axis Forces in Southeast Asia, has flown to Chongqing to meet Chiang Kai-shek. After Mountbatten took office, he intended to place the three group armies of the Burmese Expeditionary Force under his command, totaling about 200,000 men, but Chiang Kai-shek refused, and the relationship between the two, centered on the command, became increasingly delicate. Mountbatten then wanted to change the planned itinerary and fly to Chongqing, but because the Japanese army launched an offensive, the Burmese war situation took a sharp turn for the worse. Mountbatten then immediately flew to Chongqing. It is expected that Mountbatten will conduct a comprehensive review of the operation plan to recapture Burma with Chiang Kai-shek and senior generals such as General Stilwell, commander of the US forces stationed in Chongqing, and will also coordinate the operation plans of the Chongqing, British, and American armies, navies, and air forces on the Chinese mainland front. The issue of the Chongqing army's command, which had become a stalemate in the past, will be addressed. After the talks are concluded, the general counteroffensive operation in Burma will begin. When the Japanese army captured Burma in the past, the British Indian army retreated alone. Later, the Chongqing army's Luo Zhuoying army was annihilated by the Japanese army through sacrifices, and then there was the disastrous defeat of the British Indian army in the Arakan operation. With such a strategy of repeated defeats in battle, even if the enemy attempts to counterattack, there will be no chance of victory.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Chongqing's "Military Commission" issued a public statement on the 21st, stating that the battle between the Japanese and Chongqing forces in western Yunnan Province is still very fierce.</p>
<h3>Inauguration Ceremony Held by the Beijing Joint Team of the China Youth League</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The China Youth Model Corps Nanjing First Joint Team held an inauguration ceremony for the new members at the Central Corps Headquarters at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, the 22nd. After the ceremony, all the members recited the oath. Mr. Lin gave instructions, and the youth leaders led the entire people to dismiss the meeting in a heated atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Zhang Renli Appointed as a Member of the North China Political Affairs Committee</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The National Government announced on October 20th that Zhang Renli was specially appointed as a member of the North China Political Affairs Committee. This is the order.</p>
<h3>Joint Sports Meet of Chinese and Japanese Students in the Capital</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - In order to enhance the friendship between Chinese and Japanese students and to develop the spirit of sports, the Chinese and Japanese authorities in Nanjing specially organized a joint sports meet for Chinese and Japanese students some time ago, and actively held preparatory meetings to carry out various preparations. According to the results of the meeting, it was decided to hold the meet at the First Japanese National School on Zhongshan East Road at 1:00 p.m. on the 29th. There are many types of sports, and an 800-meter relay race for Chinese and Japanese teenagers with the significance of Sino-Japanese cooperation will also be held. A total of more than 3,000 students from both Chinese and Japanese sides will participate, and it is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<h3>Japanese Commander-in-Chief Returns to Nanjing</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The press department of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China announced at 3:00 p.m. on the 22nd that the Commander-in-Chief, after departing on October 13th to inspect Jinan, Kaifeng, Yuzhou, and Guangde, returned to Nanjing on the 20th.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Formation Bombs Chittagong; British Admit Military Facilities Were Damaged</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a telegram from New Delhi, the British Command issued a public statement on the night of the 20th regarding the Japanese aircraft bombing Chittagong: A formation of Japanese fighter-bombers attacked Chittagong on the 20th. British fighters intercepted them many times, and it was not clear how many Japanese aircraft were shot down or destroyed as a result of the air combat. The British side lost a total of three fighters, one of whose airmen had been rescued. British anti-aircraft artillery also fought back. In this bombing, military facilities were damaged and some people were killed or injured.</p>
<h3>Japanese Expeditionary Force in China Announces One-Week Battle Situation</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Expeditionary Force in China announced the battle situation for one week on the 22nd as follows: The Japanese army in North China's active suppression of the Communists is proceeding extremely smoothly. As a result, the Communist troops in various parts of North China have suffered a crushing blow. The Communist troops are now specifically avoiding frontal combat and wandering outside the areas cleared by the Japanese army. Since the Japanese army has been carrying out long-term clearing operations, the Communist troops' food has become difficult, and desertions of soldiers have emerged one after another. In order to destroy the Chongqing army and the New Fourth Army in the northern Jiangsu Province, the Japanese army, with the cooperation of the Chinese military police, began clearing operations on the 11th, crushing the Chongqing army everywhere and capturing a large number of prisoners. In addition, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing has suffered heavy damage due to repeated fierce bombings by the Japanese army's air units and seems to be reorganizing its air force and replenishing personnel and equipment. This trend, as well as the enemy's recent call for a counteroffensive in Burma, is worthy of attention.</p>
<h3>Propaganda Department Holds Liaison Tea Party</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - In order to strengthen news liaison among various agencies and unify wartime news reporting, the Propaganda Department specially held a liaison tea party meeting for the heads of publicity from various agencies at the Japanese-Chinese Cultural Association at 3:00 p.m. on the 22nd.

<h3>Consolidate National Strength to Win Victory; Goebbels Writes Article Reviewing the War Situation</h3>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Huitong News Agency: German Minister of Propaganda Dr. Goebbels stated in a recent article in "National Magazine" on the current war situation: Germany is using the current defensive war to consolidate the general situation. As a result of encountering unexpected military and political events, Germany needs to conduct a detailed review of the current situation in order to consolidate the national combat power. Regarding the military developments of the past few months, he said: The extent of the danger to our final victory is only relatively speaking. If the current situation is compared with the situation in September 1939, then we admit that in a certain stage of the war, the chance of final victory was closer than it is now, but although the current situation is more unfavorable, it is by no means as dangerous as it was at the beginning of the war. Germany's military setbacks this summer were actually due to the rebellion of the Italian royal family. Our evasive movement in the east was also due to this. In order to protect Southern Europe, we had to withdraw several divisions from the front line, which created the need to shorten the eastern front. However, the danger of the situation is by no means as serious as the defection of Badoglio. This action has made the enemy's strategy encounter special training, and as a result, the enemy's attempt has only achieved part of its purpose. The large-scale evasive movement implemented by the German army on the Eastern Front in the past four months was in accordance with the original plan, so it was orderly. It is admirable that the army can still control the situation in the fifth year of the war. Goebbels continued: He did not want to use the term "successful withdrawal" as a justification, but only briefly described the achievements of the German army on the Eastern Front. The enemy forces failed to cut off the main force of the German army or encircle the German army, and even failed to seize a large number of war materials. Although Germany has given up some territories, it has not lost a large number of troops and war materials. The German people's will to fight is not affected by the external success or failure of the war. The German people's calm fighting and determination for final victory have not changed in the slightest. The people's calm in the face of the ups and downs of the war and their knowledge of how to cope with unfortunate events are the main factors in the final victory and still lie in the stability of the people's hearts. The German people, in view of the failure of 1918, deeply know that this tragedy cannot be repeated today, so their morale has not wavered. Goebbels then assured the German people: All the great wars in history are the same as this one. Whoever can endure the longest can win the greatest victory. Today, no country can maintain its full strength. If the German people are satisfied with today's defensive war, it is because Germany's failure is not enough to affect the outcome of the war. Germany's recent setbacks are not due to the difficulty of the situation, but due to the German command's adaptation to the facts. We deeply know that our position has temporary weaknesses, but we cannot ignore our strength and the opportunity to win the most. Goebbels concluded: We do not admit that we have lost part of our combat power. What the enemy has gained is only a part of what we had taken in the past. If we can muster the courage we had in September 1939 today, we will continue to use our full strength to fight to the end with our belief in victory.</p>
<h3>Philippine Congress Passes Two Bills</h3>
<p>Manila, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - On the 21st, the Philippine Special Congress passed two bills: appropriating 2 million pesos to relieve the poor and changing the Philippine fiscal year to run from January to December. They were immediately submitted to the President for approval. Furthermore, Budget Committee Chairman Malaputo, in response to the question of Representative Alanz in Congress on the 22nd, explained the financial situation of the new government. The main idea is that by the end of this year, there will be a surplus of 1.3 million pesos in revenue.</p>
<p>Manila, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The 22nd was the fifth day of the Philippine Special Congress. After deliberation, a bill on determining the regular congressional session was passed, deciding that regular congressional sessions will be convened every year from October 20th. However, because this year's regular congressional session had already convened a special session from October 18th, it was postponed to November 25th. Furthermore, according to the constitution, the National Assembly convenes a regular session once a year. The first regular session of this year will begin on November 25th and will continue for 60 days.</p>
<h3>Philippines Has Been Recognized by Ten Countries</h3>

<h3>Soviet Troops in the Nieper Bend Attempt to Expand Strongholds; Fierce Fighting Continues in the Kiev Area</h3>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to Huitong News Agency: The waning of the Soviet offensive southeast of Kliementchuk and at the entrance to the Nogai Steppe is merely a thing of the past. The true weakening of the Soviet offensive north of the Sea of Azov is due to the significant losses suffered in the attack on Melitopol in recent days. As for the reduction in fighting in the northern part of the Great Nieper Bend, it is due to the Soviet command's attempt to first consolidate already gained positions, and then expand southward the strongholds they have obtained south of the Nieper River, in order to concentrate still unused reserves. It is also possible that the Soviet army intends to increase crossing points on the river, as the current Soviet river crossing points are too far apart and are frequently subjected to attacks by the German Air Force. It would be a great mistake to say that the struggle for the Nieper Bend and the entrance to Crimea has reached its peak, as the enemy is striving to expand its victories. The German command is devising plans to thwart the enemy's success. Regarding the situation elsewhere on the battlefront, fierce fighting continues in the Kiev area. German troops, attacking the Soviet bridgehead south of the city, have achieved local objectives, and fighting north of Kiev has also intensified. The situation north of Gomel in the central sector of the Eastern Front remains unchanged, with only localized fighting in that area.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German Supreme Headquarters announced the Eastern Front situation on the 21st, stating: After Soviet troops broke through the German lines southeast of Kliementchuk, they launched a local offensive on the 20th to expand the breakthrough area, but were repelled after fierce fighting. Soviet troops, in an attempt to break through the German lines between Kiev and Chernihiv, launched fierce attacks with several divisions. The Soviet offensive north of Kiev failed, and fierce fighting continues northwest of Chernihiv. Fighting has also broken out in the Melitopol and Gomel areas, and southwest of Velikiye Luki.</p>
<p>Southern Breakthrough Battle Will Reach Climax</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency report: The breakthrough operations between Kliementchuk and Dnipropetrovsk are still continuing. Although the intensity of fighting in the aforementioned locations has slightly decreased, this cannot be said to be a slackening of Soviet combat efforts. On the contrary, the fighting here will reach another new climax. On Wednesday, the Soviet army's actions were limited to using a small number of troops to consolidate the positions occupied by its tank convoys, while simultaneously seeking to expand the gap created in the south. This so-called combat assistance seems extremely inconsistent, leading to the inference that under effective German counter-attacks, their combat operations are sufficient to cope with German pressure in order to consolidate their gains. Soviet offensives in other sectors of the front also continue, but fail to indicate important locations. The Soviet attack on Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, even with attacks by several newly formed divisions, was ultimately thwarted by the German army and ended in failure. At the same time, the German advance in this area has been extremely successful, with the German army completing its designated objectives after intense combat. Due to improved weather conditions, aerial activity on both sides has been extremely active. The German Air Force is taking advantage of these favorable conditions, launching attacks day and night on Soviet supply lines. In the south, the German Air Force is greatly assisting in the Kliementchuk battle, assisting ground troops and inflicting significant losses on enemy manpower and material.</p>
<h3>Strong German Resistance in the Mountains of Southern Italy; Allied Offensive Obstructed</h3>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency report: On Wednesday afternoon, British and American forces, with only small forces, launched attacks on Field Marshal Kesselring's troops in the central and eastern areas of the Apennine Mountains, in order to continue their offensive operations. In this area, near the front lines, and along the western coastal area, British and American forces are mostly engaged in reorganizing their troops, as the enemy has undoubtedly suffered significant losses in its attempts to break through and encircle. These enemy actions are all carried out at night, and they are using the darkness to replenish their troops and transfer reinforcements. German forces are putting up strong resistance in both defense and counter-attack. The difficulties in the mountain areas have made the Allied command realize that special preparations are needed before launching large-scale military operations. During the fighting south of Baranello on Wednesday, British and Canadian forces attempted to advance south along the road from Vinchiaturo. Another enemy detachment, about one company strong, simultaneously launched an attack on a mountain range several kilometers to the south. However, German forces launched concentrated defensive artillery fire from both sides of the Volturno River, from Jalligliari and Giarelli, causing the enemy's fierce attacks in both of these locations to collapse within a short period of time, with heavy military losses. German grenadiers immediately launched a counter-attack, capturing numerous prisoners of war. A British company that had received reinforcements in Castelpetroso also met a similar fate on the eastern slope of the Apennine Mountains. The enemy troops here were also driven back to their original positions, leaving behind many dead and wounded soldiers on the battlefield.</p>
<h3>Germany Invents New Weapon: Rocket Bomb with Astonishing Power</h3>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - British Prime Minister Winston Churchill announced in the House of Commons on September 21 that the German army is currently researching new types of gliders and new types of rocket bombs, among other new weapons. Upon learning of this, world military experts were deeply shocked. The German "Intervention Report" published two photos on its cover on the 20th, showing German Minister of Armaments Albert Speer and Field Marshal Erhard Milch hiding behind an iron shield, testing the power of a new type of bomb. This has confirmed that the British Prime Minister's words were not false. The newspaper added an explanation beside the photos, stating that German Air Force Commander Hermann Göring and Minister of Armaments Albert Speer recently convened several key figures from the armaments industry and experimented with new weapons at a certain airfield on the Eastern Front. The results were good, and it is planned to use them on the front lines soon. The power of the bomb was not described, only that it could destroy fortresses, and that it was a special bomb. The German authorities are unwilling to elaborate on this, so the actual situation is unknown. In addition, sources from the Allied side claim that the new bomb is about one meter long and is a rocket-type bomb. It has wings on both sides, like those of a glider, so once launched, it can glide forward in level flight, at a speed of 500 or 600 miles per hour. Churchill said that the launch of the new bomb may be controlled by radio. However, British and American military experts believe that its shape is extremely small. In addition to being loaded with multiple explosives, it is difficult to equip it with a radio control device, so what Churchill said may not be reliable. It is said that the bomb can be launched from a distance of about one mile from the target, so it can be said to be a type of aerial torpedo. It is also understood that the machine guns and anti-aircraft guns installed on German aircraft also use rocket-type ammunition. Therefore, it is generally believed that it is quite possible that bombs will be converted to rocket-type in the future. Currently, German citizens are hoping that Germany can mass-produce this new weapon and start bombing Britain as soon as possible in retaliation, as Hitler had previously predicted that German aircraft would retaliate against Britain with bombing raids.</p>
<h3>Japan Strengthens Domestic Situation</h3>
<p>Reform of the Education System</p>
<p>As an important part of thoroughly strengthening national mobilization, many measures for the comprehensive transformation of the education system are naturally the result of a determination to cope with the current critical situation. In view of the trend of Japan's cultural and educational policies since the Meiji Restoration, and the movement of public opinion in the education sector, this is a necessary outcome.</p>
<p>The current measures are an emergency measure to redistribute the total strength of students to important sectors of the country. One of the concerns of the Japanese education sector, namely, breaking the unplanned nature of universities and higher education, will be resolved at once. With the goal of reforming culture and education and growing and developing, in expecting the permeation of the national plan for education, Japan's education is undergoing a rapid transformation in order to cope with this unprecedented war.</p>
<p>Due to the urgency of the war situation, the previous establishment of the outline of the student wartime mobilization system has placed classrooms in the broad and realistic national life, in order to prepare for the administrative stance of adapting to decisive battles while studying in practice. To make Japanese education more effectively ensure strong planning and implementation in terms of readiness. It is now rapidly unfolding, marking a new era in Japan's educational stance, which is worthy of admiration. The following will examine the specific meaning of the main measures of this time.</p>
<p>First, what most people pay attention to is the cessation of postponement of military service. In the past, postponement of conscription was regarded as a kind of privilege, which could not be without drawbacks, but this misconception has been eliminated in the fundamental idea of the reform of the school system that is currently underway. Moreover, the wrongness of it has been concretely clarified by the current measures.</p>
<p>Military Service and Students</p>
<p>The relationship between military service and student life is regulated based on the national education plan. How many people are needed in terms of military service, and how many students with what level of education are needed in terms of education, this is the result of setting the goal of the national personnel training plan. Therefore, those who go to war and those who remain in school are equally regulated according to the needs of the country.</p>
<p>Therefore, the immediate urgency of the liberal arts and law students to respond to the needs of the military is to meet the supreme demand for an increase in the number of soldiers required by the national army. On the one hand, from the perspective of education, majoring in liberal arts and law, which is the so-called study of cultivating oneself and harmonizing with others, at this time, temporarily interrupting student life and making them take up arms and go to the battlefield, is perhaps a true way to cultivate leadership talents.</p>
<p>Based on this national personnel training plan, the second measure following the cessation of the postponement of conscription is the preparation for the expansion of science and engineering schools and the cessation of university education in law and liberal arts. Furthermore, it developed into the third measure of reorganizing and unifying law and liberal arts universities and vocational schools. The biggest shortcoming in the current formal school system in Japan is the lack of a clear national plan for education. That is, the effort to establish an education plan suitable for the needs of the country was not paid attention to in previous education policies. As a result, what about the leadership talents being trained? Universities and higher vocational schools cannot fully adapt to the realistic demands of the country. The drawbacks are most prominent in the education of private universities.</p>
<p>According to a recent survey by the Ministry of Education, in Showa 17 (1942), there were 21 public universities and 27 private universities. There were 40 public vocational schools and 117 private vocational schools. Private schools also have a larger number of students, and from a statistical point of view, they occupy a dominant position. The majority of those many private schools were originally in the era of law schools, and up until the time of the free economy in past years, the state centered on law and liberal arts, expanded, and continues to exist to this day. Now that the country urgently requires the training of science and engineering students, in terms of management, private schools naturally cannot be as easy to implement as public schools. According to a survey by the Ministry of Education of the number of students entering in Showa 17 (1942), public universities in law and liberal arts were 44%, higher vocational schools were 28%, science and engineering universities were 56%, higher vocational schools were 72%, while in private schools, law and liberal arts universities were 85%, higher vocational schools were 77%, science and engineering universities were 15%, higher vocational schools were 23%.</p>
<p>Educational Waste</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education often declares that the current ideal plan is a ratio of 3 for law and liberal arts and 7 for science and engineering, but the current situation is obviously far from this ideal. This is a major waste in education. The country's expectations for every young student are extremely high, and under a planned economy, in order to establish a plan to train national personnel, it is not only necessary to drastically reorganize these schools as soon as possible, but the expenses of the lecturers and other teachers of these private schools mostly rely on government agencies, so from the perspective of management, they cannot solve the problem of concentrating in cities themselves. Currently, out of the 27 private universities, 19 are in Tokyo, 7 are in Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe. Out of the 117 vocational schools, 69 are in Tokyo, 26 are in Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe, almost all concentrated in cities. From the perspective of defending the country, this fact must also be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Regarding the reorganization of schools, the first thing to pay attention to is the correction of the overemphasis on liberal arts and the rational dispersal of school buildings in terms of air defense measures. At the same time, each school is required to examine its own content at this time and eliminate the drawbacks of the school system and the excessive number of schools.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, what is noteworthy about the current measures is the postponement of the eight-year compulsory education system. At first glance, this move seems to have a negative meaning in education, but the current higher course of the national school continues only because it has not implemented a compulsory system. In the regular course, it leaves the national school, and men have the obligation to enter the ordinary course of all youth schools. If combined with the reform of youth school education, the educational effect will not become a problem. (Xiang: Taken from the Western Asahi Shimbun on September 28)</p>
<h3>U.S. House of Representatives Holds Closed Meeting; Military Officials Report on the War Situation; Warn Americans Not to Be Overly Optimistic</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall and others attended a closed meeting of the House of Representatives on the 21st and strongly stated to about 400 members of Congress that the course of the war should not be viewed with optimism. The Associated Press Washington telegram reported on the content of this closed meeting as follows: Chief of Staff General Marshall gave a general strategic report for about 40 minutes, followed by Brigadier General Adlesteen's report on bombing operations on German soil. Secretary of the Army Stimson also expressed his views. He strongly emphasized the severity of the evolution of the war situation since Pearl Harbor, and hoped that the actual situation of the war would be conveyed to the people to warn them against excessive optimism. In addition, the Associated Press cited five points of the military authorities' report as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Strength Should Not Be Underestimated</p>
<p>Although the U.S. Pacific front has obtained air force bases for operations against the Japanese army, the Allied forces are still unable to defend these bases because the Japanese army has very powerful troops stationed in nearby locations. It is a misconception to say that the German Air Force has weakened because the German Air Force has recently made large-scale movements. The current state of the German Air Force is actually to cultivate its air force strength for future operations. Japanese war industry aircraft production more than makes up for its air force losses. The problem of insufficient manpower only exists in the United States. Japan is still mobilizing young men aged 17 to 20, so Japan has almost no problem of insufficient manpower. British and American merchant fleets have suffered heavy losses due to the activity of Axis submarines, and even more fleets have been lost in landing operations, so the transportation problem is indeed an important problem for the Allies. Aircraft have not yet reached the level where they can replace ships for transportation.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Does Not Understand Two-Front Tactics</p>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd</p>
<p>(Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Washington dispatch: U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall said in a closed meeting of Congress that the Soviet Union's repeated requests to open a second front in Europe clearly show that they do not understand the technical problems of two-front strategy. The Soviet Union underestimates the difficulties of such military actions, while British and American soldiers have gained difficult experience in the battles of North Africa, Sicily, Italy, and the Pacific.</p>
<p>Marshall to Be Transferred to New Post</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Washington dispatch, Roosevelt held a long discussion at the White House on the 21st with Chief of Staff General Marshall and his personal Chief of Staff Admiral Leahy. The Washington Associated Press reported on the content of the report by the U.S. military representatives at the closed meeting of the House of Representatives, stating: In general, many criticized the past U.S. government for not reporting the true situation of the war to the people, resulting in an overly optimistic atmosphere in the country. This time, the U.S. military representatives reported the true situation of the war at the closed meeting, and members of the House of Representatives have realized that they must be determined to launch more intense battles in the future. Roosevelt held discussions with Marshall and others after the start of the Moscow Conference. This may be the result of the Soviet Union making major demands on Allied strategy. It is also rumored that Roosevelt may recently appoint Marshall as the Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in Europe, hence this discussion.</p>
<h3>Americans Believe the War Will Be Protracted</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The British "New Leader Weekly" published a statement by Vice Admiral Horne, Acting Secretary of Naval Operations of the U.S. Navy, stating that people in both Britain and the United States have the question of how long the war will last. Horne's opinion is that even with efforts to increase the production of military supplies and ships, the war will last until at least 1949. The weekly also stated that it is useful to carefully read the economic newspapers in New York, as they want the war to be prolonged. A U.S. newspaper ran a headline saying "The legend of peace has been destroyed," leading to a drop in cotton textile stocks. Cotton textile merchants even wrote a poem to satirize it.</p>
<h3>Churchill and Smuts Dine with the King</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to news from London: King George VI dined at 10 Downing Street on Wednesday evening with Prime Minister Churchill and South African Prime Minister Smuts.</p>
<h3>Veteran British Admiral Pound Passes Away</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a London dispatch: Admiral of the Fleet Sir Dudley Pound, former First Sea Lord, passed away on the 21st due to illness, at the age of sixty-six. Admiral Pound was the most experienced figure in the British Navy. He served as First Sea Lord for five years, and only resigned last August, replaced by Cunningham.</p>
<h3>Allied Ships Lost in the Middle of the Month Total Forty-Nine</h3>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German military authorities announced the following on the 21st regarding the battle results of German submarines and the air force: Since October 1st, German submarines have sunk 33 Allied ships, totaling 227,000 tons, of which about half were sunk in the Mediterranean Sea. The others were sunk in the Atlantic Ocean. In early October, German air force squadrons attacked Allied convoys off the coast of North Africa, sinking 16 ships, totaling 130,000 tons.</p>
<h3>Stalin Receives British Foreign Secretary Eden; Hull and Molotov Hold Earnest Talks</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Moscow dispatch: Chairman Stalin received British Foreign Secretary Eden on the 21st, and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov held talks with U.S. Secretary of State Hull.</p>
<p>Situation on the Third Day of the Moscow Conference</p>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a London report: British and American journalists stationed in Moscow said that the third day of the Moscow Tripartite Conference had made satisfactory progress in the eyes of British and American representatives, but the reporters did not indicate whether the Soviet Union also felt satisfied with the results of the third day of the conference. Many military experts also participated in the discussions at the conference on this day, and the meeting adjourned early because U.S. Secretary of State Hull felt deeply fatigued and unable to continue the discussion. Reuters correspondent in Moscow, Mr. King, reported that the Soviet side insisted that the discussion of military issues should be listed as the first priority on the agenda, and the British and American delegations seemed to have put pressure on the Soviet side on this point. What's more, upon hearing the discussion that South African Prime Minister Smuts said that the Second Front could not be established this year, Moscow was greatly disappointed. Although British and American reporters in Moscow hinted that there were differences between the Soviet Union and the British and American delegations on military issues, they repeatedly stated that this conference could take a coordinated approach and hoped to obtain concrete results. However, the reports from the British and American sides never mentioned the planned meeting of the three - Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 22nd (Huitong News Agency) - The London Daily Herald reported that the Moscow Conference can be compared to a futuristic painting. We can place some hope in Eden, who declared that the Tripartite Conference will end the war earlier.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Huitong News Agency) - The Washington Post reported that the main task of the Moscow Conference is not to reach a consensus on any specific issues, but to adjust the future relations between the three countries. Once an understanding is reached, individual issues will be resolved by Stalin, Churchill, and Roosevelt. If no agreement is reached in principle, there is no need to raise other issues. The success or failure of this conference can be determined by whether the three leaders hold a meeting thereafter.</p>
<h3>British and American Air Forces Attack Serbia, and Aircraft Drop Bombs on Bulgaria</h3>
<p>Belgrade, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - On Wednesday at noon, British and American air forces bombed the town of Nis in southern Serbia, causing great damage to private residential areas, with heavy civilian casualties. Two hundred bodies have now been found in the rubble, and hundreds of Serbs have been injured. When a bomb directly hit an air-raid shelter, all the people who were taking refuge there were killed. British and American airmen also subjected civilians to cruel machine-gun fire. Immediately after the air raid, civil authorities patrolled and provided appropriate assistance to the victims.</p>
<p>Sofia, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Bulgarian Army General Staff announced that enemy aircraft flew over Bulgarian territory yesterday and dropped several bombs on Skopje, causing slight damage there.</p>
<p>Failed Attack on Germany Results in Losses</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency report: British bombers that entered central and northern Germany on the night before Thursday failed to carry out a concentrated attack due to the counterattack of German air defense forces. At that time, the weather in Germany was bad, and most of the enemy aircraft were forced to fly at high altitude. German night fighter squadrons and anti-aircraft guns broke up the British aircraft into small groups, and then shot down eighteen of their four-engine aircraft. In addition, eight U.S. bombers were shot down within German borders on Wednesday afternoon, so the total number of four-engine Allied aircraft lost in German territory has reached twenty-six. This number may increase after a detailed report is obtained.</p>
<p>Unprecedented Devastation of Churches in Italy</p>
<p>Rome, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to an initial estimate by technical experts from Vatican City: As a result of British and American air raids, the total value of church property losses in Italy is 10,000,000,000,000 lire. In addition to churches, monasteries, and other religious buildings being destroyed, the loss of art treasures stolen and damaged by the British and Americans in Sicily and southern Italy is still difficult to estimate.</p>
<h3>Javanese Vigilance Corps Cadets Enlist</h3>
<p>Jakarta, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The enlistment ceremony for the officer cadets of the Javanese Vigilance Corps was held grandly at the unit training ground at 3:00 p.m. on the 20th, under the supervision of the Japanese Supreme Commander and military administration. Some of the enlisted cadets were outstanding young men selected from 100,000 volunteers from the entire island. The Supreme Commander instructed the students on the spot, saying: At this time when the war is in full swing, the responsibilities of you young men who intend to defend your homeland are extremely important. Whether the task of the Javanese Vigilance Corps can be accomplished depends on your efforts. I hope you will remember this and strive to uphold your belief in victory and work hard in training.</p>
<h3>Yin Tong Given Public Funeral</h3>

<h3>Italian Navy Undersecretary Killed in Car Accident</h3>
<p>Milan, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to Huitong News Agency: Italian Navy Undersecretary Admiral Magnaghi died in a car accident on Wednesday morning while traveling from Vicenza to Verona. The deceased remained loyal to Mussolini during the period of difficulty for the Duce.</p>
<h3>Construction of a Trans-Thailand-Vietnam Railway Line</h3>
<p>Hanoi, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese railway technicians are currently surveying existing routes and preparing to lay new lines in various locations for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere Transverse Railway, which will run directly from Tokyo to Syonan or Rangoon. Some construction work has already begun on the new lines. Recently, the most active survey team in Vietnam has been meticulously surveying a 2,700-kilometer route from Rangoon, through Hanoi, to Saigon, working in forested areas. A concrete plan has been formulated and submitted to the central authorities. According to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere Transverse Railway construction plan, the route will run from Korea through North China, traverse the Chinese mainland, and continue south through Hanoi to Bangkok. Currently, railway connections in Vietnam are limited, as the Vietnamese Transverse Railway terminates in Saigon, and the connection between Saigon and Bangkok is by automobile. Therefore, the purpose of laying the new line is to connect this section. After surveying various routes, it was determined that a line from Tapou, 300 kilometers south of Hanoi, through the Lao border at Kek, and south to Bangkok, would be about 100 kilometers shorter than the previous route. The opinion to lay this line has become almost unanimous. This Trans-Thailand-Vietnam line, with a length of 400 kilometers between Hanoi and Bangkok, is half the distance of the 3,500-kilometer route from Hanoi through Saigon to Bangkok. The construction is also easier than the Saigon-Bangkok line. In the future, once opened, goods can be transported between Vietnam, Burma, and Malaya without the need for ships, which is of great military value. Therefore, the public is greatly anticipating the start of the project.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Local Prosecutor's Office, noting that important evidence in prosecuted cases, such as injury reports, autopsy reports, and other evidence necessary for trials, were not being submitted to the Shanghai Local Court along with the prosecution files, was causing delays in case hearings. Judges were having to issue orders to retrieve the files, which was cumbersome and delayed the proceedings. Therefore, the Prosecutor's Office has ordered all its subordinate officials to pay close attention to this matter in the future and avoid negligence.</p>
<h3>Materials Investigation Committee Holds Meeting, Passes Award Measures for Confiscated Hoarded Materials</h3>
<p>(Chung Huo News) The Materials Investigation Committee held its fifth committee meeting yesterday (22nd) at 3:00 PM at the Racecourse Recreation Club. Chinese and Japanese committee members attended, with Chairman Chen Gongbo presiding. The minutes of the previous meeting and the reports from the investigators were reviewed. From September 16th to October 9th, the number of yarn factories and merchants investigated, the quantity of yarn, and the number of families and quantity of yarn sealed were all recorded. The meeting then discussed and passed the draft of the award measures for investigators who seize illegally hoarded essential materials, which will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is reported that the committee will expand its scope to investigate the hoarding of all essential goods and military supplies.</p>
<h3>Grain Control Committee District Offices to be Established by Deadline, Commence Work by 25th</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency dispatch) The Rice and Grain Control Committee, in order to actively promote and implement the collection and unified distribution of rice and grain in accordance with the established guidelines, convened a discussion meeting with the heads of local district offices. The meeting continued yesterday (22nd) at 3:00 PM. Attending were committee members Yuan Hongdeng, Guangye Junyi, and Chen Guoquan, as well as Secretary-General Zhou Shenyu, the heads of the investigative offices and finance departments, and the heads of the local offices. Director Yuan instructed the local district offices on how to proceed with the work and set a deadline of the 25th for the establishment of the offices and the commencement of rice and grain procurement work.</p>
<p>District Office Organization Law</p>
<p>The Rice and Grain Control Committee, under the chairmanship of Director Yuan, continued to convene a joint meeting of the heads of local district offices. The matters discussed the previous day were further debated. Regarding the organization of the local district offices, in addition to the heads, there will be three sections: General Affairs, Operations, and Finance.</p>
<p>General Affairs Section</p>
<p>This section is responsible for drafting, receiving, dispatching, translating, and storing documents; maintaining the official seal; signing and reporting contracts for the purchase and sale of rice and grain; purchasing and recording rice and grain; investigating, coordinating, and reporting on the transportation of rice and grain; planning for increased rice and grain production; and registering and investigating rice merchants. Investigating the qualifications of rice procurement merchants also falls within the scope of this section's responsibilities.</p>
<p>Operations Section</p>
<p>This section is responsible for issuing rice and grain procurement permits and applying for transportation permits; evaluating the price of rice and grain purchased and applying for and approving loans; inspecting and protecting rice and grain; inspecting and weighing rice and grain; processing and storing rice and grain; packaging and transporting rice and grain; collecting and gathering rice and grain; directing and supervising the rice and grain procurement trade association; reporting on the daily transportation, storage, distribution, and price adjustments of rice and grain; inspecting the distribution of rice and grain; and storing rice bags and insuring rice warehouses.</p>
<p>Finance Section</p>
<p>This section is responsible for the receipt and payment of funds for the purchase and sale of rice and grain, as well as the management of these funds; reviewing and approving loan applications from rice procurement merchants; storing and allocating funds for the purchase of rice and grain; compiling and reporting on receipts, payments, and statistics; and preparing budgets and final accounts, as well as approving and reimbursing various expenses. The heads of the above three sections are appointed by the director to manage their respective affairs. However, the responsibilities of the Finance Section are independent, and the Rice and Grain Control Committee should directly supervise them. The local district offices should be formally established immediately after the heads assume their positions and begin procurement work.</p>
<h3>Application for Brown Sugar by Pregnant Women Under Consideration</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bay Merchant Cooperative, due to its own sugar reserves being exhausted and its responsibility to allocate sugar in the city, has repeatedly requested the allocation from the sugar distribution association to meet the needs. According to the person in charge of the Cooperative, the 8th-term household sugar has been requested from the military distribution authorities and will be released soon. Once the procedures are completed, the sale will be scheduled. It was also mentioned that pregnant women have requested brown sugar from the Cooperative. Out of consideration, the Cooperative intended to issue sugar coupons to them. However, to prevent overcrowding and potential incidents caused by non-pregnant women hearing the news, an announcement was made to suspend the issuance. As for applying by letter, it is difficult to verify and prone to abuse, so a proper method is being considered. Therefore, the matter is under consideration. Yesterday's report stating that applications could be submitted by special letter is not accurate.</p>
<h3>Soap and Matches Allowed to Supplement Registration, Justify Legitimate Reasons</h3>
<p>The registration for soap and matches, along with other daily necessities, closed on the 19th. Failure to register by the deadline will result in confiscation without leniency. However, if a valid reason is provided, such as the holder returning to their hometown, continued registration will be allowed.</p>
<p>Sales Permitted After Registration</p>
<p>After registration, sales and transfers are still permitted. However, the quantity sold and the transfer details must be reported in writing to the original registration office weekly in order to clarify the quantity of goods in stock. According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, soap and matches will continue to be supplied and allocated by the manufacturers in the future. The raw materials for matches and soap are currently abundant, and the supply is steady, so there is no shortage. After the implementation of allocation, the selling price will inevitably decrease.</p>
<p>Retail Shops Sign Contracts</p>
<p>(Central News Agency dispatch) The plan for the distribution of soap and matches based on household registration in the first and eighth districts of the city has been finalized and is being actively implemented. Sales are expected to begin in early November. 397 retail shops have been designated, divided into two categories: A and B. Category A shops must pay a security deposit of 15,000 yuan, while Category B shops must pay a security deposit of 10,000 yuan. Over 200 shops are in Category A, and over 100 are in Category B. The district offices have issued notification slips instructing them to pay the deposits by a specific date and sign the contracts yesterday. The provisions of the contracts are quite strict. Retail shops may only sell allocated soap and matches and may not sell other soap and matches to prevent abuses. The contracts are generally the same as those for household rice retailers.</p>
<p>City Primary School Teachers Petition the Finance Bureau, Director Yuan Responds Sincerely</p>
<p>Teachers from public primary schools in this city, having previously petitioned the city government and the Education Bureau to increase living expenses due to their excessively low salaries, yesterday submitted a petition to the Finance Bureau. Director Yuan received them and listened to the requests for inclusion of family stipends, increased office expenses and other issues. He responded that the exact amount of the increase could not be given because a precise calculation was still being jointly performed by the Education Bureau, but it could be assured that the treatment of the primary school staff would definitely be higher than the average salary of private schools, in order to be reasonable. The representatives, satisfied with Director Yuan's urgent response, expressed their satisfaction and will revisit the Finance Bureau next Wednesday (27th) to inquire about the increased amount, in order to bring the petition to a conclusion.</p>

<h3>Coal Briquette Merchants' Illegal Attempts Rejected by Authorities, Price Limits to be Maintained</h3>
<p>According to a reporter from the Shanghai News Agency, the authorities are still actively investigating coal briquettes. Retailers found to be violating the set prices will not be shown any leniency and will be strictly investigated according to the law. However, according to a spokesperson for the Coal Briquette Association, the daily supply of coal briquettes from the various manufacturing plants belonging to the association is sufficient to meet the daily market demand. However, small vendors claimed yesterday that the daily supply of coal briquettes from the mechanized coal briquette factories is at most one ton and at least several dan, which is far from meeting the demand. At the same time, according to another source, manufacturers and small vendors have recently made illegal attempts, which the authorities have rejected. Given that the control system has shown some effect and prices of many goods are gradually declining, and that coal briquettes are an indispensable daily necessity for both rich and poor residents, the standard price should be maintained persistently. Officials from the Coal Briquette Association are guiding members to increase production and find ways to adjust market conditions or assist in investigating the inside story. Relevant authorities have earnestly advised coal briquette merchants not to engage in black market transactions in order to protect people's livelihoods. They have also urged the strengthening and adjustment of coal industry organizations to prevent the allocation of coal from being manipulated or monopolized. The Small Vendor Association has drafted a petition based on the resolutions of the previous members' representative meeting and will submit it to the authorities for approval in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Eighth District Hotels Ordered to Report Guests Daily</h3>
<p>The Eighth District Hotel Trade Association office received an order from the Special Police Division of the Third Police Bureau instructing all members to submit daily guest reports, which will be compiled by the Hotel Trade Association office and submitted to the Special High Section for review. Over 100 hotels are complying with the order, but there are still 80 hotels that have not. The director of the Hotel Trade Association office, Ding Sheng, concerned that members would be penalized, plans to investigate the matter through the offices of each Baojia district.</p>
<h3>First Police Bureau Baojia Department Reorganizes Personnel, Announces List of Senior Officials</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Director of the Baojia Department of the First Police Bureau, Gu Lin, officially took office on the 7th of this month.

<p>Rice Merchants Adulterating and Distributing Inferior Flour, Powder Wheat Special Committee Investigates and Punishes Hefeng Yong Rice Shop for Swapping and Selling Flour</p>
<p>(Central News Agency dispatch) The Flour and Wheat Special Committee of the National Commercial Control Association, in order to meet the needs of the people's food supply, has allocated top-grade white flour for the 50th period of household rations in the first and eighth districts. However, the Committee, aware that the household flour purchased by the people is sometimes adulterated, has announced that if any retail rice shop adulterates and distributes inferior flour, the household head who purchased it can report to the Committee at No. 2 Beijing Road, 3rd floor, so that the matter can be investigated and punished. It is reported that the Committee received a report yesterday from a citizen that the household flour distributed by Hefeng Yong Rice Shop (ration number 311) at No. 311-313 Ai'erjin Road, North Shanxi Road, was all second-grade flour. After receiving the report, the Committee immediately dispatched personnel to investigate the reported rice shop with the citizen who provided the flour sample. The investigation confirmed the report, and it was discovered that the rice shop had more than 20 bags of second-grade flour in stock. In this situation, the rice shop is not only harming the people's livelihood but also violating the government's ration system policy. In addition to reporting the matter to the Economic Affairs Division of the First District Office to dispatch personnel to thoroughly investigate the matter, cancel the business license, and not grant ration rights, the Committee will continue to conduct secret investigations. If similar situations are discovered, they will be severely punished in order to deter unscrupulous merchants.</p>

<h3>Reporter's Cup Soccer Game, Overseas Chinese Win over Friendship, 3-2, 3-0 in First Half</h3>
<p>The soccer game held yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM at the Yifu Stadium by the Shanghai News Reporters Association to raise welfare funds was a grand event. Mayor Chen specially sent Propaganda Director Liang Xiuyu to preside over the opening ceremony. The director of the City Chamber of Commerce, Yuan Hongdeng, specially sent Secretary Cheng Zhiliang to preside over the awards ceremony. No less than several thousand spectators attended, and the atmosphere was unprecedentedly warm and lively. The right to purchase the first two balls was purchased by the daughter of the owner of Yuqing, and the daughter of Mr. Xie Jialin, the owner of Dingda Ironworks, each spending 50,000 yuan. Their enthusiasm for this association's welfare work is admirable. As a result of the soccer match, Overseas Chinese won over Friendship by one goal, 3-2. Overseas Chinese led 3-0 in the first half.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Cut Through Three Defenses</p>
<p>After the Director of General Affairs presided over the closing ball ceremony, Overseas Chinese began to attack. At the five-minute mark, Fu En of the Foreign Affairs Bureau shot fiercely from the penalty spot. Xian Han could not save it in time, and the ball landed in the goal, making it 1-0. Overseas Chinese gave Friendship a warning. Friendship counterattacked, but the ball was unlucky and did not succeed. At the twenty-five-minute mark, Ru Lian of the Foreign Affairs Bureau broke through and shot powerfully again. Liu Xian Han was caught off guard and conceded another goal. 2-0. Friendship attempted to help others in need, but all was unsuccessful by tiny margins. At the thirty-five-minute mark, two people: Yipo Lihote and Pan Tuosun. flew left and right. At the 20-yard point in front of the Friendship goal, Pan Tuosun hooked and sent the ball to Sa Zhaijiang, who shot obliquely and scored again, 3-0. Overseas Chinese had a three-goal lead. At this point, Ping Yichen of Friendship used all his strength to break through single-handedly but failed. A'kui also made several wonderful aerial shots, but the ball was unlucky. Overseas Chinese led 3-0 in the first half.</p>
<p>Friendship Recaptures Two Cities</p>
<p>After the second half, the army was at war again. Friendship wanted to wash away the previous humiliation, made great changes in military appearance, and strengthened the forward offensive. Wu Qixiang took the post of left winger, A'kui changed to left forward, Zhao Peng retreated to left midfielder, Yongfu was transferred to the right, and Yingquan filled the right back. The military appearance was greatly enhanced, and Overseas Chinese also adjusted their general positions, with Nafuke replacing Huoli Huote and Xue Erfo replacing Yishao Shan. Both teams were in high spirits. Friendship attacked, the momentum was amazing, but the ball was still unlucky. Yi Chen's powerful shot went out to the right post, and A' Kui's wonderful temporary hook was caught squarely by Zhili Manhou. At around the 20-minute mark, Xiao Feibianjiang went straight in, and when he was near the goal, Overseas Chinese Xu Erz grabbed the ball anxiously, touching the game ball. A penalty of 12 yards was awarded, and Song Lingsheng took the penalty and went straight into the lower left corner. Friendship opened the record. Overseas Chinese had an atmosphere of revitalization. Minutes later, Xiao Gao raised his foot to hit the ball hard. Xu Erz arrived in time, and Pan Li Man rushed out at the same time and was blocked. Li Yichen came flying from the sky and added a kick, hitting the empty goal. 3-2, Friendship's situation improved. Afterwards, Man Tan tried to create another record, but time waited for no one, and in the end, they lost by one goal, 3-2.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Spokesman Talks About Burma Counter-Offensive Operations</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch: The spokesman for the Japanese Army Press Department, at yesterday's regular press conference, made a statement on the Allied counter-offensive operations in Burma against the Axis forces, saying: Currently, the Allied forces seem eager to attempt a counter-offensive in Burma. In early summer this year, the Allied forces attempted to retake Nichi-kei (likely referring to a battle), launching a counter-offensive operation, but ultimately failed. This had a particularly profound impact on the Allied nations, especially the Chongqing side. The Indian people's contempt for the British has also deepened as a result, and the Indian independence movement has become increasingly prominent.</p>
<p>Mountbatten Arrives in India</p>
<p>Capturing Burma and reopening the Burma Road is a must, both for reasons of prestige and for the continuation of anti-Japanese counter-offensive operations in the future. Since Lieutenant General Mountbatten, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in Southeast Asia, arrived in New Delhi on the 7th of this month, the tone of Chongqing's discussion of a counter-offensive in Burma has become lively, and they have frequently expressed their desire to devote themselves to it. It is said that Mountbatten arrived in Chongqing on the 16th with political advisor Sir Gaiswick and others, and has repeatedly met with Chiang Kai-shek at the Chiang Kai-shek Villa since the 18th, until he left Chongqing and returned to his post on the 21st. At that time, he explained to Chiang the Asian counter-offensive operation plan decided at the New Delhi conference, and strongly demanded that the Chongqing army make the greatest sacrifices, which goes without saying. Whether the Chongqing side's dissatisfaction with the command authority and operational policies of the Southeast Asia Command has been eased in this meeting remains unknown.</p>
<p>Chongqing Newspaper Commentary</p>
<p>According to the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao on the 18th, "Learning from the lessons of the previous Nichi-kei battle, the operation to retake Burma cannot rely solely on land operations, but must launch a landing operation on the Kra Isthmus and the Malay Peninsula at the same time." In addition, the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission's official newspaper, the Saodang Pao, stated on the 19th that "to comprehensively adjust the East Asian counter-offensive operations, it is necessary to reopen the Burma Road first. The reason is that attacking Singapore is difficult. In order to comprehensively adjust the Southeast Asian operations, it is necessary to restrain the Japanese army in China, so it is necessary to reopen the Burma Road first to ensure the supply of the Chongqing army." The Ta Kung Pao strongly advocates a multifaceted operation, while the Saodang Pao consistently emphasizes Burma Firstism. This difference in opinion was already fully exposed at the Beivenquan Conference held in early September.</p>
<p>Internal Opinions</p>
<p>The divergence of opinions within Chongqing provides clear evidence of this. The highest military authorities in Chongqing are now organizing the Burma Expeditionary Force, with the commander of the Sixth War Area, Chen Cheng, serving as the commander, looking for opportunities to counter-attack Burma. It is said that the Expeditionary Force consists of Du Xiaoming's Fifth Army Group, Song Xilian's Eleventh Army Group, and the Ninth Army Group formed later. The Japanese Expeditionary Force in Burma, aware of the Chongqing army's intentions, suddenly launched an offensive from Mangshi, Longling, and Tengchong in Yunnan province in early October, immediately surrounding the 15,000 troops of Song Wuyue's 36th Division, who were entrenched in fortified positions in the northern mountainous area at the eastern end of the Yunnan-Burma Road, attempting to put up a stubborn resistance, and launching a fierce battle.</p>
<p>Break into the Nujiang River</p>
<p>On the 17th, they suddenly broke into the Nujiang River and crossed the Suichaiba. The Japanese troops quickly pursued the fleeing Chongqing army and continued to advance northward into the Zhichuan River Valley. Liang Jiacao, the Minister of Propaganda for Chongqing, expressed extremely pessimistic remarks when he met with reporters on the 20th, stating that the Japanese side had "strengthened the Japanese army's forces stationed in Burma and western Yunnan, attempting to attack China or India, but as of now, the Japanese army has not yet reached the easternmost part of the Nujiang River." The Allied forces attempted to launch operations on the Indian-Burmese border and simultaneously launch operations in Yunnan to disperse the Japanese forces, but before the war had even unfolded, the Chongqing army had already lost a key position, casting a major shadow over their future operations. The embarrassment of the Chongqing side is all the more imaginable.</p>
<h3>Minister Hirota Talks About the Indian Question</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch: At a joint reception held by the Japanese Propaganda Bureau, Hirota, the Information Minister of the Japanese Embassy, yesterday (22nd) made the following statement to our Chinese press corps (regarding the Indian question): "Yesterday, October 21st, Jiang Tela Boss took office as the head of the Provisional Government of India in Showan. From the perspective of a Japanese person, I consider this a respectable and gratifying event."</p>
<p>Indian Culture</p>
<p>For hundreds of years, India has been invaded by the Mughal, Portuguese, and British empires, and has continued to live under constant oppression. For thousands of years, it has possessed a high level of culture in philosophy, religion, and art. Even now, the Indian people still have a high level of understanding of this culture. As for those who do not understand modern Indian culture, it must be the result of British propaganda, which completely prevents them from understanding the essence of Indian culture. In the last three hundred years, although India has been under the rule of various countries, it has emerged with its own cultural awareness as the basis, seeking its own independence, restoring its political power, and fulfilling the long-cherished wishes of the 350 million people of India. Regarding the establishment of a unified Provisional Government of India, from the perspective of the revival of East Asian nations, it is a very great force, and in terms of the development of East Asian nations and the cultural exchange of East Asia, it is a great opportunity.</p>
<p>Special Significance</p>
<p>Regarding the establishment of the Provisional Government of India, based on my speculation, it contains several special meanings, which are described as follows: First, the establishment of this Indian government is the first unified government in Indian history. Second, the independence lost four hundred years ago has been restored today, four hundred years later. Third, this independence is a fact that the East Asian nations themselves can achieve through their own efforts. The work of Jiang Tela Boss has been specially assisted by various parties, which is a fact that we should not forget. After India's independence, counting the independent countries in East Asia, the countries that have become independent since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War include Burma, the Philippines, and India. Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, there were already four countries: China, Japan, Manchukuo, and Thailand. If these seven countries unite in the future, they will be able to defeat the Allied forces. Regarding the Provisional Government of India, using its own army composed of unified Indians to participate in the war, I think it has special significance in the independence of India. Therefore, it goes without saying that we should make every effort to assist in the independence of the Indian nation, which is our responsibility.</p>
<p>Economic Circle Comments</p>
<h3>Encouraging National Savings</h3>
<p>The economist's theory of abstinence is an extremely valuable theory in economic thought. It is believed that abstinence has a close relationship with the formation of capital. The formation of capital must be partly due to capitalists restraining their present enjoyment and partly due to citizens abstaining from other uses of unproductive things. This principle is the same as the sacrifice of labor for the enjoyment and unproductive consumption. All are obstacles to the source of restraint. Therefore, we feel that the current campaign to encourage national selection is in line with the economist's theory of abstinence.</p>
<p>Encouraging national preparation can realize the currency returned by the government’s position, and the people’s position is enough to save costs. It cannot be said that it is the most meaningful movement under the wartime system. Therefore, since the issuance of special savings bonds in early July this year and the regular prize-winning savings held at the end of September have been a test to encourage national savings, from the latter, there has been a National Savings Week held in Beijing recently; All the firms in Beijing are currently busy collecting money, and according to general speculation, the savings results should not be less than those mentioned above. In addition, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Bengbu will also promote them separately. From this point of view, encouraging national savings has formed a common movement that is consistent with the country.</p>
<p>Originally, saving is thrift, and thrift can save. Now, the two movements of encouraging savings and promoting thrift are running side by side without contradicting each other, and they are echoing each other. Isn’t the true meaning of this still to persuade wartime people to restrain personal desires, save part of their consumption, and contribute to the increase of production? The comprehension of this meaning has gradually spread to all strata of society. Therefore, the café and dance hall industries, which have always advocated non-thrift, actually held a seminar yesterday to discuss the issue of thrift!</p>
<h3>Sugar Industry Special Committee Prepares to Form a Joint Association Will Be Announced in the Short Term</h3>
<p>Regarding the transportation, distribution, and supply of sugar, Shanghai has been fully responsible for this matter since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War through the "Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office." Up to now, the stock of sugar in the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office is 200,000 bags, which will be distributed. After the Business Coordination Committee set up a Sugar Industry Professional Committee, the existing sugar industry organizations should be reformed. Now, the Sugar Industry Professional Committee of the Business Coordination Committee is considering preparing to form the "Shanghai Sugar Wholesale Joint Association." This joint association will be announced and established in the short term. As for the lower-level organizations of the joint association in the future, they will be members of the Shanghai Sugar Industry Association, and members of the sugar industry associations in various inland areas will also organize similar organizations.</p>

<h3>General Situation of Miscellaneous Grain Production in Central China This Year</h3>
<p>Recently, according to a reporter from Datong News Agency who inquired with officials in charge of miscellaneous grains, a summary report on the production situation of various account crops in the Central China region this year is as follows:</p>
<p>Soybean</p>
<p>Soybean production is centered in Bengbu. Last year, 200,000 bags (100 kg per bag) were transported. This year's harvest may reach this number. However, due to the recent rise in the Huai River, many embankments have been breached, which has had a significant impact on soybean exports, and the prospects are not optimistic.</p>
<p>Barley</p>
<p>The Huai River area is also an important barley production area. The harvest has also been affected by the Huai River disaster, similar to soybeans. However, generally speaking, the situation in Central China is good, and it is possible to harvest between 40,000 and 50,000 tons.</p>
<p>Sorghum</p>
<p>This year's production in the triangular area is expected to be around 150,000 dan, Yangzhou and Taizhou about 50,000 dan, northern Anhui 50,000 dan, and other areas 50,000 dan.</p>

<h3>Rice, Coal, and Smoke: Eradication of Impurities</h3>
<p>Currently, every dan (unit of weight) of household rice contains a lot of sand and fine debris, especially in broken rice. It is reasonable for people to sell what they have after purchasing rice at the ticket price. However, the economic situation of the middle and lower-class residents is not affluent. They lack extra money to buy fine rice and also lack the leisure to carefully pick out the impurities in the rice. Most of them eat the rice with these impurities mixed in. I often think, does this practice of adding impurities harm the health of citizens?</p>
<p>A few days ago, in the "Social Services" section of this newspaper, I saw two reports about illness caused by eating sand. Therefore, it is already clear from the facts that impurities in household rice harm health. I heard that these impurities can not only cause inflammation of the tongue but also lead to various gastrointestinal diseases, hindering the body's digestive functions and causing great damage to health.</p>
<p>Since impurities in household rice are so harmful, it is of course best to find a way to remove them. Now, let's trace the origin and first explore the source of impurities in rice.</p>
<p>Rice originally has no impurities. Even if there are some occasionally in the market, there should not be so many. Undoubtedly, the impurities are not naturally mixed in the rice, but added by people. Household rice is allocated by the Changju Bureau. We think that the authorities, with the people as their foundation, would certainly not add such impurities to harm the people for the benefit of a few. Therefore, some people say that perhaps it is the rice merchants who add them. Generally, unscrupulous merchants often see profit and forget morality, disregarding others.</p>
<p>However, whether it is added by rice merchants or there are other reasons, since this substance is harmful to health, we must not ignore it any longer.</p>
<p>For the happiness of tens of millions of citizens in Shanghai, the author hopes with utmost sincerity that the authorities will promptly investigate the source of impurities in the rice and strictly eradicate them. I believe that the authorities care about the people and will not dismiss this suggestion lightly. (Jiang Yue)</p>
<p>Rice Grain Coupons</p>
<p>The previous report mentioned that rice grain coupons would be issued when the Rice Grain Bureau collects rice. The author humbly wishes to offer a few words, believing that those in charge of the Changju Bureau...</p>
<p>This time, the authorities have their own difficulties in preparing to issue rice grain coupons. However, in order to prevent rumors about the monetary system and for the sake of the farmers themselves, it seems that there are areas that should be paid attention to. No one ignores the rural economy; its motive power is very limited. In ancient times, people could barter, but now that currency is prevalent, how can farmers be expected to exchange their goods for those unfamiliar coupons? If so, currency in the countryside is just as fragmented as in the city. If rice grain coupons are used as the price for rice, then we must try our best to enhance its paralyzed nature, that is, rice grain coupons should lose their circulation. Then, rice grains will be hindered, and it is an unsurmountable hindrance. Because if rice grain coupons cannot circulate, or their circulation is weaker than currency, then even the poorest farmers will not give up the edible rice for non-circulating coupons (think about rice). Rice is the farmer's product, and it is the lifeline of the people. How can they easily throw it away and exchange it for a piece of paper coupon? If farmers refuse to sell rice, isn't that a major blow to the grain policy? May the Changju Bureau consider this. (Mang)</p>
<p>The Black Market for Coal Balls</p>
<p>Recently, the most difficult item to obtain in the market is coal balls. It is difficult to buy them even on the black market. If available, they must be pre-ordered, and you must wait two or three days. Moreover, the coal balls obtained are not really coal balls but like mud and stones, with no "fuel" value at all. If this continues, the citizens of the city will have a day of being unable to cook. Therefore, this matter has become urgent and brooks no delay.</p>
<p>However, the creation of this situation has a process. To the general public, it seems that the factory and retailers are the culprits, deliberately taking advantage of the situation to raise prices on the black market. Everyone knows the law, but they are not afraid to violate it. The formation of this mystery is not clear to ordinary people. Therefore, I would like to thoroughly analyze the rumors.</p>
<p>The main raw material of the manufacturing factory is smokeless coal dust, allocated by the authorities, with a price of about 300 yuan per ton. The mixed mud and debris purchased by themselves are also worth dozens of yuan. Adding the manufacturing cost of 200 yuan, the total cost is 500 yuan. The authorities allow a profit of 50 yuan, so the ex-factory price is 550 yuan per ton. This price has been the official manufacturing price set by the authorities for the first half of the year to date. The price of the main raw material allocation has also never been increased by the authorities. Unexpectedly, recently the factory's expenses have become huge due to the difficulty of purchasing things, especially the daily machine wear and tear costs are particularly high, but the profits have not increased. Therefore, income cannot cover expenses, and it is difficult to maintain operations. Later, the factory once asked the authorities to raise the price limit, but it was rejected because the reasons were not sufficient. The factory then wanted to increase the retailers' cartage fees, from 20 yuan per ton to 60 yuan, but was rejected by the authorities. The factory became angry and retaliated, reducing production, using the excuse of maintenance shutdowns, and increasing debris, etc., as indirect resistance. They also secretly engaged in black market transactions, reaching more than 800 yuan per ton, thus creating the current black market.</p>
<p>Secondly, let's discuss the situation of retailers. Retailers' coal balls are of course purchased from the factory. The wholesale price has always been 550 yuan per ton, plus 20 yuan for cartage. The price limit set by the authorities is 32.5 yuan per dan (unit), which is 650 yuan per ton. If one ton can be sold per day, the gross profit is 80 yuan, and after deducting the loss of coal dust, the net profit is only 60 yuan. May I ask if this meager profit can maintain the expenses of a store? Moreover, how many stores can sell more than one or two tons? From this, we can see that their daily life is extraordinary. Unexpectedly, recently the factory has changed the way to increase the cartage fee to 60 yuan, invisibly reducing the retailer's profit by 40 yuan. In addition, the factory has recently taken actions such as suspending production and reducing production volume, causing retailers to receive only a quarter or none of the coal balls per day. Otherwise, they can only search for coal balls from the factory's black market to maintain expenses. May I ask if this situation can avoid the creation of a black market? Where can the retailers seek redress for the injustice they have suffered?</p>
<p>The above situation is the cause of the black market and panic for coal balls. There is no need to argue for either side. Because I am in the industry and have experienced it myself, I know it very well. I deeply hope that the authorities should quickly thoroughly investigate the root cause of the black market and re-consider the minimum profits of both parties. On the other hand, the authorities should deal with the factory's illegal actions, such as using excuses to suspend production, reducing production volume, and smuggling for profit (as reported in the newspaper about the smuggling of a large company). Then, the black market and panic for coal balls will disappear by themselves. Finally, I believe that if you want to stabilize one thing, you must start from the root and prescribe the right medicine. You can't just suppress the surface to succeed. For example, when a flood occurs, instead of trying to open up tributaries, you build high levees. The consequences will be unimaginable. (Petty Official) (Moving to help students)</p>
<p>Improvement of Cigarette Rationing</p>
<p>There are many articles and discussions about improving the rationing method, but most of them focus on superficial measures, such as strict investigations and asking citizens to report, etc. Although the authorities are so vigorous, merchants still secretly sell batches of rationed goods through the back door, transport them to street vendors or other places, turning them into black market goods and making a fortune. Citizens have no evidence to report, and investigations have become empty words. Although that is the case, I do not object to this method, but I think that a considerable root method should be used in conjunction with it, so that the results can be better.</p>
<p>Now let's take cigarettes as an example: A batch of cigarettes is allocated by the rationing agency, but the number of people who get cigarettes is very small. In terms of the overall amount of rationing, it cannot be said to be small. But why do so few people get cigarettes? As far as I know, there are roughly the following two reasons:</p>
<p>When merchants are rationing, they claim to allocate only 20% to the public, and the remaining 80% are secretly sold on the black market.</p>
<p>The 20% of the rationed amount is still bought by people who are usually familiar with each other, and some people may buy one or two packs.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, the rationing system has been destroyed by these unscrupulous merchants who seek personal gain. The Huazhong Tobacco Rationing Association has noticed this and proposed to remove and return the tin foil and paper packaging of the rationed cigarettes to prevent abuses. However, imagine if a street vendor or store sells you a bundle of loose cigarettes at a black market price, what evidence do you have to report them! Moreover, in the past, a large number of cigarettes, tin foil and paper packaging were circulating outside, causing various abuses, so it is still not a good method.</p>
<p>It is best to print the words "rationed" on the cigarettes and paper packaging, and force the registration of inventory, and limit the time to print the words "rationed" on the inventory, otherwise it will not be sold. Then, with the addition of investigation and reporting work, the abuses can be eradicated. In this way, whether in towns or cities, if a black market is found, anyone can report it, and it is also convenient for the authorities to investigate. During the tense period of wartime material control, the control and rationing of other materials can also refer to this method and handle it with discretion. This is just my humble opinion, I don't know if the authorities will accept it? (Jifei)</p>

<h3>The Daughters of Mary Help of Christians Orphanage Appeals for Homeless Orphans</h3>
<p>The Daughters of Mary Help of Christians Orphanage in Shanghai has been established for many years and has greatly benefited society. Unfortunately, it was suddenly destroyed by artillery fire, causing a group of helpless children to be abandoned. Fortunately, the female priests in charge of the association, with their loving and compassionate hearts and sacrificial spirit, vowed not to let them decrease and ran around various ports in Southeast Asia. In order to solicit donations, they received sponsorship from various parties and continuous assistance, so that the orphanage continued to exist. For five or six years, it has been supported by the hard work of the female priests. Now, the sea routes are cut off, and external donations have stopped, while local living expenses have skyrocketed, and the number of homeless children is increasing daily. The female priests, true to their original intentions, still plan to accommodate them as much as possible, but they are unable to do so, and the expenses are difficult. They specifically gathered colleagues to discuss, and all believed that it was an established cause, how can it be allowed to wither, causing society to suffer even more losses. Therefore, with the intention of accumulating small contributions, they respectfully inform the benevolent people of all circles, generously donate and enthusiastically contribute to jointly maintain the orphanage, so that it can continue to exist, which is immeasurable merit.</p>
<p>(Donations can be sent to Shanghai Dahua Bank at 289 Jiujiang Road)</p>
<h3>Ms. Zhou Manhua is Enthusiastic about Public Welfare and Education Assistance</h3>
<p>Ms. Zhou Manhua, an actress from the Zhongzai Film Company, cut the ribbon for Fang Jiuxia Yongchang Jewelry Store and donated 3,000 yuan as seed money to the store and decided to donate 1,000 yuan each to the Shenbao Education Assistance Fund, the Xinwenbao Loan Fund, and the Pushan Villa. Ms. Zhou's enthusiasm for public welfare is commendable, and the jewelry store's generosity is also commendable. It is expected that all sectors of society will respond and that more poor students will benefit.</p>
<h3>Vocational Guidance Center Runs Training Classes</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Social Welfare Bureau Vocational Guidance Center has not only been actively engaged in job placement but has also recently focused on guidance work. During the summer vacation, it has been vigorously promoting guidance for further education. Recently, it has been entrusted by various parties to run employee training classes. Employee training is an important policy for major factories and institutions today. Recognizing this, the center has specially formulated regulations for employee training classes and compiled a syllabus of employee training courses, divided into two types: common sense training and technical training. The materials are relevant to reality, and both literates and illiterates can understand them. The center has invited famous people in the education field to teach. It is reported that the training will begin within this month for the employees of various institutions in the Chamber of Commerce Building and will last for four weeks. It is also planned to promote it to various contracted factories and major tricycle companies. Recognizing that citizens often encounter legal problems and are forced to seek help but have no way to do so, the center has specially established a legal guidance center, hiring famous lawyers in Shanghai to provide free guidance. Anyone who encounters such problems can seek guidance from the center (inside the Chamber of Commerce or 200 Remi Road, District 8). The legal mentors of the center can provide free guidance on everything.</p>
<h3>YWCA Evening School Enrollment</h3>
<p>In order to promote women's education, the Shanghai YWCA is offering women's evening classes at Hongyi Middle School on Jing'an Temple Road after 7:00 pm every day. The main subjects are Japanese, English, Chinese, bookkeeping, and cost accounting, focusing on practical and special skills training. It is now enrolling 50 free places. Those who have junior high school education or above and are interested in learning but have poor families can quickly register with the association.</p>
<h3>Yanggou Siltation Affects Health</h3>
<p>All the residents of the Nanli alleys on Hado Road are poor people. Since the road was built in the first half of the year, many Yanggou ditches have been silted up, and foul odors are overflowing, which affects hygiene. Previously, we sent letters to the Hado Foreign Company and the health authorities, but they ignored them. This accumulated water has been there for two or three months. If it is not drained quickly, I am afraid that infectious diseases will spread. We urgently hope that the authorities will send workers to dredge them as soon as possible to restore residents' health.</p>
<h3>Looking for Cremation Site</h3>
<p>A friend of mine is seriously ill and is terminally ill. He says that there is no hope of recovery and that he will die soon. His family is very poor and cannot afford the funeral expenses. I remember that there used to be a cremation site in the city (reportedly on Haig Road). I don't know if it is true. I implore benevolent people to indicate its location and all the expenses so that my friend can have a proper burial. (Jiang Zhiyi)</p>
