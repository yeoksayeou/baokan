<p>社評</p>
<h3>歡迎日本文化使節團　（一）</h3>
<p>中日文化協會將於明日在京召開第二次全國代表大會，共商今後兩國間文化溝通問題，友邦日本爲表示贊助，特組織文化使節團遠道而來，參加大會，我們深信，這是對於兩國今後邦父親善上必有重大貢獻約。我們如果把眼光放得遠大些，一切國際間約關係，凡是外交談判，經濟合作所不能增進友好關係約，只有文化交流可以獲得成功。而目別種活動，都只能收效於一時，只有文化交流，才是眞正的建設性的和永久性的。因此，我們對於友邦日本文化使節團之蒞臨，敬願號召。國表示熱烈的歡迎，而有熱烈的期待。</p>
<p>中日兩國文化，求本溯源，原來出自一體。兩大民族有着同樣的高尚的信念，有着同樣的爲這高尚的信念而奮鬥的精神。可是，正如我國民諺所謂：「源遠流長」，兩國文化的發展，漸走不同的方向，中國文化，在內憂外患，封建壓迫的　煎逼之下，自宋代以來，即呈停滯狀態。至最近數十年間，始以康梁等提倡的啟蒙運動，走上發展的新生之路，但已落後於日本。同時，日本文化一直在發展中，至明治維新而呈一日千里之勢；但是，他更澈底的與歐美文化融合，而走上資本中義的道路。於是中日兩國之間的隔閡愈深，而不幸事件，亦接踵而至。今以大東亞戰爭爲契機，使中日兩大民族開始迎接着血肉相關的新局面，要求彼此互相交流的程度日益迫切，而如何使兩國民間互相澈底了解，富爲一切問題的關鍵所在。如果不把握住這二要點，則任何政策方針，都不免有扞格鑿柄之結果；只有認淸這一要點而努力，一切問題就可迎刃而解。要使兩國澈底了解，恢復本來的態勢，其最緊要的和首先的步驟，便是兩國文化之重新溝通，我們所以特別歡迎和摯誠期待於日本文化使節團之蒞臨者在此。</p>
<p>關於溝通中日文化，這並不是新的口號，過去已有許多先覺者爲此努力。不過，就事實來看，日本學者之研究中國文化，除了少數例外，大多數人是車視古代而忽視現代，或許因爲他們的見解，認爲中國古代文化，爲東方民族文化之淵源，亦若干方面，日本學者研究古代中國文化之成功，還遠出乎中國學者之上。可是對於現代中國文化，其注意力與興趣，却遠不如研究古代中國文化之濃厚，因此，才造成一般日本人士對現代中國的不了解，實爲數十年來中日關係演變的癥結所在。自大東亞戰爭爆發以來，此種觀念始漸在日本人士中發生變化，對於現代中國文化開始注意，對於中日文化溝通，爲割時代的轉機。我們今日所能摯誠向友邦日本文化使節團獻言者，就是在參加大會之後，策動日本人士普遍研究現代中國之文化動向，特別是要從中國現代的圖書文籍擴展到「民間喜怒愛惡」這種不用文字紀載的文化資料方面去：從成名的人物擴展其訪問範圍到一般知識份子，平民，尤其是索樸天眞的靑年方面去。我們深信：只有這樣的努力，才會收穫更豐富更切實的結果，也才會切實地了解現代中國，才會更有助於中日文化之溝通。</p>
<p>此次友邦日本文化使節幽諸君子，都爲中國文化界久巳仰慕的先進，在日本文化界高尙的目標和使節幽諸君子對中日文化溝通的熱誠感召之下，我們深信這次中日文化協會一定有寳貴的成就，必能有偉大的貢獻，我們敬代表中國人民，恭祝中日雙方出席全會諸君健康。</p>

<h3>突尼西亞南部　英包圍計畫失敗　軸心軍已完完整撤入新陣地　北部央第一軍攻勢亦被阻</h3>
<p>柏林三十日中央社電　昨晚柏林軍事機關宣布、軸心軍於英方在突尼西亞南部作包抄之企圖後、已於星期日實行後撤、敵軍方面完全未曾察覺、據昨日德軍最高指揮部之公報、認上項軍事行動極爲成功、後撤之軍隊、大半爲義大利部隊、因此項撤退、未被英方察覺、故　無損失、英軍司令蒙特戈姆萊將軍欲在南戰區包圍軸心國軍隊之企圖、至此已告完全失敗、</p>
<p>里斯本三十日中央社電　南突尼西亞英軍、昨日沿馬萊斯綫增加壓力、冀圖集中力量、突破軸心防綫、軸心方面、亦極頑強抵抗、英軍前綫所發消息雖謂在突尼西亞北部海岸地帶及在加勃斯西四十公里之埃爾哈瑪方面獲有進展、但亦承認各地軸心軍之抵抗極爲頑强、英軍攻擊見阻於軸心之反攻及北部之惡劣天氣、路透社駐北突尼西亞特派員稱、第一軍曾佔領小山數處、但星期日因雨雹驟降、英軍之進攻受阻、德方消息稱、集合於梅傑斯愛爾巴準備向東北及東面進攻之英軍、已被德軍砲隊所擊破、但最近英第一軍已獲得增按、故德軍指揮部預料該區之英軍或將再事進攻、</p>

<h3>盎格魯撒克遜人的本相（三）</h3>
<p>— 德富豬一郎原著</p>
<p>海頓說道：</p>
<p>「在法國，處女純潔，主婦不穩正；在荷蘭，處女不穩正，主婦純潔；在英國，處女，主婦，都不穩正。」</p>
<p>這或許是言之過當。但是我們對於這些評語，却不能不加以切記。又美國獨立檄文的起草者托馬斯•哲斐松也說道</p>
<p>像英國政府那樣不道德，傲慢無理，虛榮心和野心的熾烈，冀　制海權的專有，沒入於腐敗混濁之中，我們美國人對之，有消弭不掉的嫌忌者，實在再找不出第二個國家來。我們知道在近世英國的歷史上，或英國政府的主義及其實行的辯護者中，以求關於自由或政治意義的敎訓，是沒有用的。商人國的主義，是錢而非道義。不但如此，自從英國以商業和腐敗著名於世以來，直到現密，在歐洲諸國中，像英國那樣對於自國的同盟欠缺信義，是沒有一國出其右的。」</p>
<p>假使現在起哲斐松於地下，使其一看如今的現狀狀—自國的狀態是怎樣？英國的狀態是怎樣？自國和英國的同盟狀態是怎樣？我們一加細讀他的話，恰如預言今日英美的現狀和兩當軸的關係。我們就以這個機會，勸告現在大總統羅斯福，對於開國歷史創造者之一的哲斐松的話，應該反復加以熟讀。</p>
<p>康德說道：</p>
<p>「無論那個國家，像英國民那樣可嫌忌，慘虐而又傲慢且好戰爭的國民，恐怕沒有。」</p>
<p>路德指着英國人說道：</p>
<p>「你們的國家誠然沒有狼，可是你們自己却就是狼。」</p>
<p>盧梭更說道：</p>
<p>「英國人稱贊他們自己，稱贊他們人道的精神及人民的親切心；可是縱如他們所冀望，讓他們大聲疾呼，恐怕未必有人會加以反應的吧。」</p>
<p>最後我們更來引用美國始祖喬治華盛頓的話。華盛頓向着其敵將英軍司令官說道：</p>
<p>「我們的兵士在你們手裏的，受着極不人道的待遇。如果沒有地方上人士之慈善的輸將，他們恐怕都要飢餓而死。尤其豈有此理的，是把我們的兵士加入你們的兵士裏面，强使他們對我爲敵。」</p>
<p>現在盎格魯撒克遜人怎樣待遇在美國，在印度，在澳洲及其他的他們勢力範圍內的日本人呢？如果讓華盛頓來看看，那末他將怎樣說法呢？美國人對於其始祖，不感得慚愧嗎？還不是英國人隔了百餘年，非但沒有改掉舊時的暴惡，而月更爲變本加厲嗎？</p>
<p>（四）腐敗的盎格魯撒克遜人</p>
<p>我們的先輩確實是給盎格魯撒克遜人騙倒了的。橫井小楠把華盛頓看做近代的堯舜，對於美國，雖然還沒有說是可比唐虞三代，也已認爲庶幾其盛况。說是如果他自己得志，當先提世界和平之說以求美國大總統。又大久保甲東自明治四年底以迄六年上牛，於其周遊世界之際，致書於當時留學俄國的西德二郎，說是「像英法文化上達之國，是未可希蹤幾及的，不如以德國或俄國爲模範入手：以故，極望把俄國的制度文物詳爲考察」云云。不久以前，有一次我於皇國海軍界中，和那位爲海軍歷史及海軍戰術之權威的其中將談話之際，我說。</p>
<p>「那來英國就是腐敗，總還是　吧」。</p>
<p>然而其提督還是作色而起，辯駁我的話，說：</p>
<p>「不，不，決不腐收」。</p>
<p>而關於政治方面，立憲　治全然以英國爲本家宗匠，縱令在法文上並不完全用彼爲模範，然於其思想，精神，總還是奉爲圭臬。正像論到世界富的巨擘，首舉大英銀行一般，說到憲政的泰岱，也總以爲是英國議會。這不但是日本人這樣想，世界的多數人士，也同樣被其騙倒，而盲目地加以崇拜，所不同的，只是程度之　罷了。這些被騙倒的，誠然不免無智之譏，可也是因爲世界上像盎格魯撒克遜人那樣善於官傳的，實未見其匹之故。他們確是有着化朽腐爲神奇之手段的一個民族。</p>
<p>日本人如果一度通讀英國的歷史，也就很快地被其麻醉騙倒吧！英國的歷史和日本的歷史，論年代沒有多大差異，但是日本的歷史，乃是戴萬世一系，天壤無窮的皇室的，從神代以迄現在，如大河之流一般，混混滔滔，依於時世之進步，其河流亦愈廣大遼森。然而英國的歷史，是沒有什麼一貫的，若是說有，那末也只是海盜根性罷了。大槪說來，英國的歷史，可以分爲三個階段。最初的歷史，是被別的民族所征服的歷史。在羅馬時代，最初是被凱撒征服，其次是被克羅提阿斯征服。這被羅馬征服的印象，至今還是很深刻地遺存着。徹斯脫頓在其所著英國史的劈頭會這樣說：</p>
<p>「法蘭西和英吉利所最重要的，並非是保存羅馬的遺物。即法蘭西和英吉利已經不是保存羅馬遺物的時候了，他們自身就是羅馬的遺物」。</p>
<p>但是，不只是羅馬是英國的征服者。不久，便是所謂盎格魯撒克遜人的使入。其次是丹人的侵入，最後有諾爾曼人的襲來。這諾爾曼人的襲來，爲上期英國史的一個分水嶺。而這諾爾曼人，原是那本來征服英國的丹人之一分支。可是他們雖然是同根生的，却因着諾爾曼人侵入法蘭西，定根據於法蘭西的諾曼底，一百年間便差不多法蘭西人化了。在他們征服了英國以來，使英國全然爲法蘭西化，其言語，文學，文章，全然應用着法文。而那個成爲新征服者的威廉，一方面在英國做了英國的國王，一方面則做了從屬於法國國王的諾曼底公。</p>
<p>英國和法國的關係，是那樣地相聯繫着的。嗣後，英法間的糾紛，不絕地相尋續着。法國的少女貞德，好容易把英國的勢力驅出大陸，使歸還於原來的島國。</p>
<p>然而英國之成爲世界的大帝國，畢竟還是受着貞德的恩賜哩。何以故呢？那是因爲英國從大陸撒手，其冒險的精神，就轉向到世界各地，循致新領土的獲得。</p>
<p>第二期裏，專從事內江，國王，貴族，庶民之間，交相爭鬬；同時還有宗敎上的葛藤糾纏着，擾攘不巳。可是到了第三期，英國才伸手於世界的隅陬。在所征服的各處，用着所有的罪惡，所有的方便，得寸進尺地薦食不已，以至於二十世紀底的今日。這樣打成了人口佔全世界四分之一，土地佔全世界四分之一的一大帝國。如果說英國是有着擊國的精神的，那末就是海盜的精神。英國至今握有私掠的執照，一到戰爭，就忽地把海盜的行爲成爲公開的執照，使國民大大地從事一下。凡所謂自由的話，是正相反對的。在第一次世界大戰時，威爾遜提起海洋自由的問題，使英國爲難，就是這個緣故。</p>
<p>英國的憲政，是徹頭徹尾由着賄選成立的，英國的立憲政治家而在英國史上展着空前絕後的手腕的窩爾波爾，曾經說：「各人都有其代價的」。這意思，就是他把人們當作打着價碼的貨品，只要出錢，就得任意支配。所謂「袖子的選舉區」，這話就是英國貴族的大地主可得任意操縱選舉區的意思。那個後來成爲自由黨泰斗的格蘭斯頓，其當初原是由紐基約斯爾公爵的「袖子選舉區」當選出來的。而所謂「選舉法改正」，雖說一面是選舉權的擴張，一面是腐敗選舉的取締：可是無論用着什麼手段，方法，總脫不了買收之實，只是戲法人人會變，各有巧妙不同罷了。日本人站在遠遠地卞觀測出來的所謂理想選舉等等，其實在英國是決沒有那麼一回事的。</p>
<p>英國的選舉別出一新機軸的，是約瑟·張伯倫，他用着科卡斯的方法，把本黨各選舉區的投票適宜調節按派，由此而選出和選舉人的數目不相應之多數的議昌來。　可是，要幹這種　情，黨費是最爲必要的，因此政黨的勝敗，全視乎其能籌得黨費的多少來決定。至於這黨費是怎樣得到的呢？那是靠着猶太人的手來作大宗的挹注，以及在猶太人以外用種種腐敗的策略羅掘而來的。</p>
<p>其中最爲著明的方法，就是賣時運動。巴佐特會經指着英國的爵位制度說道：</p>
<p>「這是調節國民的拜金熱的一個方法。」</p>
<p>豈知爵位的本身，却是挑發拜金熱的一種手段。那就是獲得了政權的黨派幹部，看出目標的人物，而向之兜售爵位。準男爵，而男爵，而子爵，而伯爵，甚至出賣較此以上的爵位。其黑慕會經給英國的國民評論雜誌揭穿，徹斯脫頓所著的英國史中，曾把其事特筆寫計着。</p>
<p>如果是知道英國政黨在世界大戰以後的歷史者，當如何失驚於英國政黨腐敗之一至於此！爲憲政之模楷的，其果這樣卑鄙的嗎？一定要爲之不勝其感慨長嘆的。勞合•喬治的內閣在大戰後瓦解，雖有着好多的原因，但其最足舉數的，便是其內閣由鬻爵所得的金錢，歸之首相勞台·喬治呢，還是歸之擁護他的那成爲多數黨的保守黨之手呢？</p>
<p>又，自十九世紀中半以來放着煊赫的光彩之自由黨，在第一次大戰以來的趨於沒落，其最爲重要的原因之一，也是爲的是由鬻爵而得的黨費，應該留在勞合·喬治的腰包裹呢，還是公開給黨的幹部呢？愛斯葵斯派的黨員，主張應歸黨的本身所有。勞合·喬治則主張應歸他自己所有；縱使歸之於黨，其分配，使用，也應由他撥派。因着他的堅持固執，致使自由黨的領袖們互相反目，終於把黨的本身葬送掉了。這恰如賭徒的夥伴們爭着頭錢的分配而打起架來一樣，是個不成樣的笑話。除吒以外，腐敗的材料·還是指不勝屈。</p>
<p>這樣的物質萬能的英國人，美國人，是怎能知道日本的實力呢？那個會經長久住在日本，講日本的文法，知道日本古典的古事記，萬葉集芝價値的敎授張伯倫，於離去日本之後，刊行一本小冊子，題爲「日本的新宗敎」，說：「維新的元老製造着忠君愛國的新宗敎。「日本的維新，是由忠君愛國心發揮出來的，並不是維新的元勛製造出忠君愛國來的，這在日本人看來，不待言而自明。可不知他到底用着什麼眼光來談大伴氏之歌，防人之歌的？像他那樣，不能不說是眼睛雖然不盲，而心却已盲了英美人當初輕侮日本，以爲日本易與畢竟是由於他們的物質萬能之心念所誤，、原是不足怪的。但那陶醉於盎格魯撒克遜人的物質萬能，對於日本的前途爲杞人之憂者，却也不能不說是身爲日本人而心已爲盎格魯撒克遜人的了。我們切祈這樣的人，在日本一個也不要留存。（丁：譯自三月十六日，十九日，二十日，二十一日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>評書　米價大跌</h3>
<p>自從全國商業統制總會成立及物資移動限制緩和以來，上海租界區域內的食米黑市價格寬大跌特跌。這個發展是很健全合理的，因爲從此以後我們最大多數的市民生活可以安定得多了。米價跌了，於是其他物價亦有隨之而跌的傾向：雞蛋跌價了，茶葉跌價了，肥皂更跌價了。</p>
<p>百物黑市價格既有隨食米而跌落的趨勢，於是投機囤戶着急了，乃又瞎造謠言，軍票停止新發行後儲備券要膨脹了，儲備券對華北聯銀券之比價要跌落了等等，希望如驚弓之鳥的滬人心理又爲之動搖起來，再行收買食米，再行捨幣取物。其實就常情論之，軍票停止新發行後，儲備券的需要增加，亦即其效用增高，亦即其價值或購買力加大，這也是必然的。日圓既興聯鈔等值，而日圓與儲鈔之法定比率自亦爲一八與·一〇〇，這是自然之理，那裏有儲鈔貶值之可言？</p>
<p>米價跌後，百物趨跌，則黃金與棉紗之黑市即不當仍在續漲中。黃金在戰時爲最最無用之物，寒不能衣，饑不能食，而華中物資之最最充足者即爲棉紗，故黃金與紗價之漲，誠爲最不合理的現象。默想起來，當局對此，終必有其驚人的措施，以爲斬草除根之計。</p>
<h3>銀錢業通告　實施統一通貨政策</h3>
<p>銀錢兩業同業公會昨通告會員行莊云「逕啓者，頃奉財政部錢二字第七四號訓令開」查政府爲統一通貨起見，曾於上年五月實施整理舊幣時，將中儲券與軍票之兌換率，與友邦商定按中儲券一百元兌換軍票十八元，最近我政府宣布參戰，友邦爲加強我戰時經濟政策起見，對於我國通貨問題，復謀澈底合作，爰定於本月四月一日起將軍票之新發行毅然廢止，並將其在華國庫之支出，及其銀行存款借款滙兌等項之支付，不再使用軍票，嗣後中儲券與日圓聯擊其兌換率仍保持一百元對十八元之比，除由本部發表談話亞分行外，合亟令仰該工會迅即轉知各同業，自本年四月一日起所有國庫支出凡用軍票者，一律改用中儲券，而銀行錢莊之存款借款滙兌等項之支付，亦不得用軍票，事關統一通貨政策之進行，務各一體遵行」等因奉此，相應分別通告，至希查照是荷」。從此，四月一日起，行莊存放款滙兌等支付，將不得再用軍票矣。</p>
<h3>兩當局嚴限　捲烟商平賣</h3>

<h3>日橋商工會議所　召開定例總會　青木主席致詞</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　上海日僑商工會議所，廿九日假日本俱樂　召開定例總會，會議席上青木主席致詞，列舉儲會議所今後應循方途，認爲：建設新中國　應以（一）打　依賴英美，（二）使中國成爲現代國家，（三）確立健全之經濟制度等爲三要點，第一打破依賴英美，由於英美在華勢力之肅清，其基礎已成，第三點確立健全經濟制度尚未就緒，第二點使中國成爲現代國家，須俟確立經濟制度後始可。其次關於建設經濟上海，實有必要性，如揚子江下游地區物資移動限制，及創設華中收買配給機構之統一統制機關全國商業統制總會等，均爲適應新情勢之經濟制度，此種新經濟政策確爲劃時代的大轉變，中日財界，應始終於公正立場，根據虛懷若谷善隣相扶之大義，適應國策，完成建設經濟上海之目的。此外新經濟政策之變革與影響，將涉及生產，配給，收買，交易，通貨，物價等等，至爲複雜，其間上海日僑商工會議所，負責之範圍勢必　大，目前全國商業統制總會已將關係商品之登記等事委託會議所辦理，又總領事館似已內定將大量之華人食米配給事務，移交會議所進行云。</p>
<h3>關於商業統制實施之商榷（一）</h3>
<p>— 高勳</p>
<p>最近全國商業統制總會成立於上海，辦理全國物資統制事宜，自此吾國已從自由主義之經濟階段，正式步入統制政策之經濟階段。此在吾國經濟史上誠爲值得注意之事。蓋統制爲新興之政策，而以商人自治的方式，辦理統制，則又爲統制之別一方式。既鮮成規，復之先例，究應採取何種有效方法，始足以完成其使命。在學理上殊有研究之價值。日來各方視綫，集中於此，商民藕藕思議，更有謂此種商業統制，即限制的自由經濟制度者，其故由於現行辦法，因襲　政，側重於許可證之簽發，而於整個統制之實施方法，尚未見明朗之宣示，以致見人見智，言人人殊，而有種種臆測之詞。目前實施商業統制，下列四點，似宜首予注意，茲分論如次：</p>
<p>（一）宜行廣泛之調查與詳密之統計：統制經濟，別名計劃經濟，故統制首重計劃；倘無計劃，即不能獲得成效，此理極易明顯，譬如統制生產，不僅以管理生產事業及其機構爲限，更須將全部生產與全部消費，兩相衡量，舉凡生產所需之原料，勞力之供給，投資之利息，企業之利潤，消費之數量，節約之限度，皆在衡量之列。然後通盤籌劃，謀適應民需與軍需雙重消費之生產，始克達到統制生產之目的。又如實　配給，亦不僅以分配現有之物資爲限，更須就現有之物資，及在短期內可能增產之物資，觀察消費彈性之強弱，分別緩急，統籌支配，始克達到統制配給之目的。顧以現在經濟社會內容之複雜，欲求能澈底了解上述各項情形，以便通聲籌畫，實非易事、雖以主持人員學術湛深，經驗宏富，共同詳之　劃，宜可共　，然少數人之思考，究備於主觀與估計，其初步設施，雖亦可獲得表面上之成就，然在統制之全部過程中，終必有不協調之時，自須利用客觀之資料，作爲依據。惟欲獲得可　依賴之客觀資料，必須施行廣泛之調查與詳密之統計。按現行商統總會之組織下，似照此　機構之設置。鄙　宜設統計專室，延攬專門人才司理其事，然後可以專責成而觀厥效。</p>
<h3>生活必需品的動態</h3>
<p>食鹽</p>
<p>食鹽和食米，同爲安定民生的必需品。重慶治下的民眾，自從事變以來，因爲海鹽的來源斷絕，五年來無時不在鬧着食鹽恐慌，民眾苦不勝言，但是國府治下因爲有產量豐富的海州盬，餘姚鹽，在戰爭中雖然一度鬧過食鹽恐慌，可是不久恢復和平，今日的國府治下，再沒感到食鹽不足的民眾了。</p>
<p>海州的鹽場，是華中的最大鹽場，現在早已恢復舊觀，配給機構非常健全。華中鹽業公司成立以還，已經超過五年，其間雖有數度洪水爲患，共匪襲擊，可是華中鹽業公司，不畏巨艱，努力復興，現在的產鹽量，超過了預定數額，成績十分良好。</p>
<p>此外在華中還有足與海州鹽田匹敵的舟山列島，餘姚等處的無數鹽田，出產之大，嘉惠華中極多。現在華中鹽業公司多收買的食鹽，除了海州，舟山，餘姚之外，還從海南島運進，華中的配給機關，就是一般舊鹽商所合組的裕華公司，該公司創立於前年十二月，賦予華中全域一家包鋪的特權，在該公司創設之前，本來歸通源鹽業公司一家包銷，後來裕華公司成立，通源也就解散，一切權限都移交裕華鹽業公司。</p>
<p>裕華鹽業公司對於一般民需的配給系統，參酌各地的情形而定，在相當於普通批發性質的地方，設立直營辦事　或官鹽棧，如果這一個地方有合作社的，那末直接發給合作社，民眾能以最低的價格，購買良質的食鹽。</p>
<p>上海方面，共設六大分銷處，由各該分銷處派給食鹽與店鋪，但如有客家大宗需要，可不經食鹽舖的轉手，直接向分銷處購買，對日僑的配給，特再設立虹口辦事處，日商零售舖，均歸該辦事處派給。上海四周地區，計有浦東，南川等辦事處，其中如有交通不便者，由直營或半，營的管鹽棧經售，清鄉區方面因物資移動有嚴格限制，所以在清鄉區的配給系統，和一般內地不同，常熟，蘇州，無錫，常州都設有分公司，配給於所屬各鄉鎮的食鹽舖，偏僻地方，另設小規模的零售店。（三月二十一日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>缺陷與希望</h3>
<p>— 羅柴夫</p>
<p>“世上一切滋長與成功，多由於「缺陷」而產生，沒有缺陷，世界就變成「死」的世界，單調的世界，試想，假使世上永遠「花好月圓人長壽」，雖然表面上是「圓滿」了，但是世界也就因此而停滯不思進展了，那還有什麼生之意義與價値可言？</p>
<p>「人生的意義」是要在缺陷中顯明，不生「病」，不知健康之可貴，不嘗到「苦」，不知道樂的價値，不懂得矛盾，便不明白「創造的人生」的眞味……而這些「病」，「苦」，「矛盾」……便是所謂人生的缺陷。</p>
<p>人生的價値是要在「希望」中存在，有了「希望」，方有努力的奮鬥，有了奮門才有成功，而世上也只有成功的人才知道「生之價値」。</p>
<p>所以充實生命的是「希望」，產生「希望」的是「缺陷」，希望與缺陷相伴而生，缺陷越多，希望越大，過去有缺陷，所以需要發展的歷史，現在有缺陷，所以要努力改進，但將來呢？將來當然也有缺陷，所以希望是無窮盡的。其力量也是無限制的。</p>
<p>「缺陷」與「希望」，它們之間相互的關係是要在「缺陷」中求「希望」，不要爲了「希望」而求「希望」，從缺陷中求希望，則希望有它現實的根據，如希望是超乎「現實」的「夢想」，則它決不可能實現。</p>
<p>世上眞正的「圓滿」不是絕對的圓滿，而是相對的「圓滿」，相對的圓滿基於「缺陷」，一缺陷」要它圓滿，又必須成長在現實的「希望」之中。</p>
<h3>人體器官座談會</h3>
<p>— 凌祖仁</p>
<p>日期：苦難年頭裏的一個初春的深夜。</p>
<p>人物：口，眼，手，眉，足，腰，肩，耳，鼻……</p>
<p>口：（以唉！做開塲白）這年頭，碎米飯，靑菜湯，簡直把我淡得速滋味都辨別不出來了，眞是「三月不知肉味」。</p>
<p>眼：對了！在這幾個月裏，我何曾看見過一片肉呢？</p>
<p>口：不要講享受了，就是說話吧，也儘是　苦道窮，簡直沒有說過一句快樂而有興趣的話。</p>
<p>手：不是嗎！工作，我做了比以前更多，更辛動，雖然；鈔票，也比以前拿的更多，但是，不知怎的却老是『入不數出』，無怪手要您嘆苦經了</p>
<p>眉：您祇要瞧我，在臉上老是擠在一起，一副愁苦的神氣，就十足表現我們主人生活的不景氣了。</p>
<p>足：倒霉的還是我，爲了生活，就整天的奔波，雖然精疲力盡，但是還得跑，路，就像是永不會跑完的。</p>
<p>腰：嗄！您爲了生活而奔波，我何嘗不受它的壓制呢！您瞧！生活的重擔，把我壓得彎彎的，再也挺不起來。</p>
<p>肩：您還是間接的呢！我可直接的擔負了這一副重擔，我負擔的重量，眞千百倍於您</p>
<p>耳！好了！好了！您們的訴苦，我眞聽得膩了，不知幾時，大家才能脫離困苦呢？一</p>
<p>鼻：『年年難過年年過』，我們努力來向這苦難的年頭挑戰吧！戰勝它！克服它！我相信，祇要我們都能够熟識時代，認淸我們的責任，奮鬬，努力，那末：我們就可以獲得生活上永久的安定，您們不用急，因爲，我已嗅到一股『新生』的氣息了，祇須我們的努力，就可以獲得它，目前的艱辛，真就是日後安定的磨練呢！</p>
<p>口，眼，手，眉，足，腰，肩，下，（同聲）：對！對！我們該努力！奮鬬，負起各個的責任，來爭取安定的生活。</p>
<p>遠處的鷄啼，驚住了它們。…………口，眼，手，眉，足，腰，肩，耳，鼻，都在靜寂裏期待着。</p>
<h3>春天雜感</h3>
<p>— 樹生</p>
<p>當春未來時，許多人都用了極大的熱望，期待春的到臨，但春來了，他們却沒有實行他們的計劃。可見期待都是虛偽，只有實幹，才是眞的，不期待的人們，在他人期待的當兒，早已完成了偉大的工作！</p>
<p>春的陽光，非僅使人們得到溫和與輕鬆，更給予花草自由發展的機會；這的確是春的力量，春與冬的不同處，就是如此。</p>
<p>只要是有生命的草木，都在春風的拂動下醒了，它們不願放過良好的機會，日長夜大，不幾天又將恢復舊觀；這實在是給予蹉跎者的良好教訓！人的成功，雖不能像草木樣地突進，但只要不住地努力，成功是必定的酬報！</p>
<p>春天的景物，常能引起多數人回憶過去的快樂，（即報章雜誌上，也常能見到回憶過去快樂的文章！）初不知往者已矣，同憶只能增加更多的煩惱，絕不能成爲事實，要得到實際上的快樂，只有在困苦中努力工作，那麼將來成功後的快樂，定會倍蓰於回憶中的快樂的！</p>
<h3>淸道工作</h3>
<p>— 天明作</p>
<h3>算得什麼！</h3>
<p>— 小洛</p>
<p>世界上有一種人：他們安坐在佈置堂皇的臥室中，高昂着雪白硬領襯托着的頭大聲叫：「我們要忍耐，我們要吃苦，我們要努力，我們要……」。</p>
<p>可是，另外有一種人：他們努力掙扎於人生泥濘途中，被滿了創傷，低沉着頭，一步一步默默地在向成功道上走着。</p>
<p>這是絕對不相類似的二種人。社會上對他們的態度與待遇好像是：</p>
<p>前者爲君子！（其實是自私虛僞的）</p>
<p>後者爲小人！（其實是爲公實幹的）</p>
<p>不過，這算得什麼？我們切不要爲了這一點而氣餒，動搖我們不是輕易能够培養成的「信心」。眞理是永存的！不過一時被蒙蔽住罷了！</p>
<h3>根</h3>
<p>— 辛波</p>
<p>『好的好的，陪你去。那末下山之後到我家去坐坐吧。』大根的興致被引了起來，立刻答應了。</p>
<p>『哈，你的糞桶怎樣呢？』阿五笑了起來，『你挑着糞桶去遊山麼？』</p>
<p>『那不要緊，我只要喊一聲，二根就會來挑回去的。』</p>
<p>大根說了，就向西北走過幾步，到了看得見山下的地方，立下來，對一個正挑着另外兩隻重沉沉的糞桶的人，高聲喊着：『二根，二根！』等到底下那人抬起頭來時，他指手割脚地說：『你挑上來吧！並且將兩隻空的一併挑回去，我要陪阿五哥上靈山去。』</p>
<p>大根和二根原來是替換挑的，二根由坑裏挑到山下，他由山下挑到山上，二根應了一聲，依舊低頭挑着走。</p>
<p>『二根今年幾歲了？他挑得到山上來麼？』阿五問。</p>
<p>『十七歲了。他可以沿路歇着的。』說着，大根走過來，將扁担向桑樹田裏一挿，又對阿五補了一句：『我們走吧。』</p>
<p>『那倒耽擱你的工作了。』</p>
<p>『這算什麼。』</p>
<p>他們走入了羣眾的隊伍中。</p>
<p>『去年玫瑰花田似乎還要多些，爲什麼今年少了呢？』阿五隨便問。</p>
<p>『國灰玫瑰花沒有銷路，　所以大家就鋤去了改種桑樹和山芋。看來今年的　子是要貴的，聽說上海的存繭，去年燒去了不少。……』</p>
<p>他們並着肩，一路閒談一路走。不久，他們到了小靈山的頂點，一塊大石壁的旁邊。壁下有一些水積在一個窪　，許多孩子都蹲下去用手指蘸些水，潤潤眼睛，據說，這是可以治眼疾的，又立起來將鞋底輕輕地在水面上一觸，據說這樣鞋子濕了水便格外耐着了。</p>

<h3>Welcoming the Japanese Cultural Delegation (1)</h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Cultural Association will convene its second national congress in Beijing tomorrow to jointly discuss issues related to cultural exchange between the two countries in the future. To show its support, our friendly nation, Japan, has specially organized a cultural delegation to travel a long distance to participate in the congress. We firmly believe that this will surely make a significant contribution to the amicable relations between the two countries in the future. If we take a long-term perspective, of all international relations, only cultural exchange can achieve success where diplomatic negotiations and economic cooperation cannot enhance friendly relations. Moreover, other types of activities can only be effective for a short period, while only cultural exchange is truly constructive and permanent. Therefore, regarding the arrival of the cultural delegation from our friendly nation, Japan, we respectfully call upon the country to express a warm welcome and have fervent expectations.</p>
<p>The cultures of China and Japan, when tracing their roots, originally came from the same source. Both great nations share the same noble beliefs and the same spirit of striving for these noble beliefs. However, just as our national proverb says, "A long river has a distant source," the development of the two countries' cultures has gradually diverged in different directions. Chinese culture, under the duress of internal troubles and external invasions, as well as feudal oppression, has been in a state of stagnation since the Song Dynasty. Only in recent decades has it embarked on a new path of development with the enlightenment movements advocated by Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao, and others, but it has already lagged behind Japan. At the same time, Japanese culture has been continuously developing, and with the Meiji Restoration, it has shown a rapid pace of progress; however, it has also more thoroughly integrated with European and American cultures, and embarked on the path of capitalism. As a result, the gap between China and Japan has widened, and unfortunate events have followed one after another. Now, with the Greater East Asia War as an opportunity, the two great nations of China and Japan are beginning to welcome a new situation of close ties, and the degree to which they need to exchange with each other is becoming increasingly urgent, and how to enable the people of the two countries to thoroughly understand each other is the key to all problems. If we do not grasp these two key points, then any policies and guidelines will inevitably lead to inconsistent and inappropriate results; only by clearly recognizing this key point and working hard can all problems be solved easily. To enable the two countries to thoroughly understand each other and restore their original state, the most important and first step is to re-establish cultural communication between the two countries, which is why we especially welcome and sincerely look forward to the arrival of the Japanese cultural delegation.</p>
<p>Regarding the communication of Chinese and Japanese cultures, this is not a new slogan. Many pioneers have worked hard for this in the past. However, in terms of facts, Japanese scholars' research on Chinese culture, with a few exceptions, most of them attach importance to ancient times and neglect modern times, perhaps because they believe that ancient Chinese culture is the source of Eastern ethnic cultures, and in some aspects, Japanese scholars' success in studying ancient Chinese culture is far beyond that of Chinese scholars. However, their attention and interest in modern Chinese culture are far less intense than in the study of ancient Chinese culture, which has led to the general Japanese people's lack of understanding of modern China, which is the crux of the evolution of Sino-Japanese relations over the past few decades. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, this concept has gradually changed among the Japanese people, and they have begun to pay attention to modern Chinese culture, making the communication between Chinese and Japanese cultures a turning point in the era. What we can sincerely offer to the Japanese cultural delegation today is, after participating in the congress, to encourage Japanese people to universally study the cultural trends of modern China, especially to expand from modern Chinese books and literature to cultural materials without written records, such as the "joys, angers, loves, and hates of the people": to expand the scope of interviews from famous figures to ordinary intellectuals, civilians, and especially simple and innocent young people. We firmly believe that only with such efforts can we harvest richer and more practical results, and only then can we truly understand modern China, and only then will it be more helpful to the communication between Chinese and Japanese cultures.</p>
<p>All the gentlemen in this cultural delegation from our friendly nation, Japan, are advanced figures whom the Chinese cultural community has long admired. Under the inspiration of the noble goals of the Japanese cultural community and the enthusiasm of the gentlemen of the delegation for Sino-Japanese cultural communication, we firmly believe that this Sino-Japanese Cultural Association will surely have valuable achievements and make great contributions. We respectfully represent the Chinese people and wish good health to all the representatives from both China and Japan attending the congress.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Tojo's Speech</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo's speech mainly stated the following: Today is the auspicious day of the third anniversary of the return of your country's government to Nanjing. Recalling these three years, the officials of the National Government, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, have continuously worked hard and steadily prepared various policies and measures, achieving remarkable results. In January of this year, they resolutely rose up to declare war on Britain and the United States, sharing life and death with our country, vowing to assist our country with all their strength to complete the Greater East Asia War, which is truly admirable. Now, the general public of your country, under the leadership of the National Government, is gradually uniting and building a new China, and is fully cooperating with our country to complete the Greater East Asia War. From the perspective of the future of our Greater East Asia's one billion people, their enthusiasm and determination are truly commendable. Since the National Government joined the war and China and Japan issued a joint declaration, although it has been less than three months, Sino-Japanese cooperation has gradually become concrete, and today we have witnessed our country implementing the return of the exclusive concessions in China, the Amoy and Gulangyu Public Concessions, and your country recovering the Beijing Legation Quarter. Moreover, our country notified the transfer of more than 1,000 enemy properties in China on February 9th. All of this is well known to you. The reason why various important matters can be realized so quickly is due to Chairman Wang and the officials of the National Government understanding our country's true intentions and working hard on the cooperation between China and Japan, and it is also sufficient to prove our country's sincerity in treating each other with trust. Our country, in this severe autumn of the world war, has established a solid foundation for certain victory and non-defeat, and will always strive for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. On the occasion of celebrating the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, in addition to renewing and strengthening the determination of Sino-Japanese cooperation, we also wish your country prosperity.</p>
<h3>Various Japanese Concessions and Legation Quarters Held Reception Ceremonies Yesterday, Chairman Wang Issued a Directive</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency telegram) - Regarding Japan's return of exclusive concessions in China, the National Government specially dispatched reception commissioners on the 30th of this month to go to various places to hold reception ceremonies, and read out the Chairman's directive on the spot. The original text of the directive is as follows: On January 9th of this year, the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States. On the same day, our friendly nation Japan signed an agreement with our country based on the Basic Treaty of Sino-Japanese Relations, resolutely and voluntarily returning the concessions ahead of schedule and abolishing extraterritoriality. On March 14th, both parties further agreed to move the details of the concessions. Today, on the anniversary of the National Government's third anniversary, the Japanese exclusive concessions in Hangzhou, Suzhou, Hankou, Shashi, Tianjin, Fuzhou, Amoy, and Chongqing are being handed over. This is truly a concrete manifestation of our friendly nation fulfilling its promise to help our country achieve independence. We would like to express our deepest gratitude for this. The goal of the National Revolution is to seek freedom and equality for China. The method to achieve this goal is to awaken the people and unite with the nations in the world that treat us equally to fight together. The first step in the struggle is to eliminate unequal treaties. For decades, compatriots across the country have been working tirelessly but have not been able to achieve it. Now, as the peace movement enters the stage of participation in the war, thanks to the friendly nation taking the lead, we should deeply recognize the Father of the Nation's legacy of Pan-Asianism, deeply understand the gist of uniting with nations that treat us equally, and deeply understand that the success of the Greater East Asia War and the completion of China's independence are inseparable. From now on, we should examine ourselves more strictly, double our efforts, and advance towards the great path of completing the war, reviving China, and defending East Asia, together with our friendly nation Japan, sharing weal and woe, and living and dying together. After our friendly nation returns the concessions, the local authorities and the people of the whole country should especially recognize the difficulty of the current situation and understand the importance of their responsibilities. They should fulfill the obligations that a civilized country should fulfill, so as to enjoy the rights that a civilized country should enjoy. The past delusions of luck, the psychology of suspicion, and the attitude of self-abandonment must be swept away. Living together with the people of our friendly nation, we should love each other, be more sincere, trust each other, and understand each other, and increase our friendship, so that we will not disappoint our friendly nation's kindness in helping us, and we will promote friendly relations, coexist, and prosper together. Let us encourage each other. Chairman of the National Government Wang Zhaoming, March 30th, Republic of China Year 32.</p>

<h3>South Pacific Front: Major Victory for Japanese Air Force; 202 Enemy Planes Shot Down in Mid-March; Victory Ratio Against U.S. Air Force is Seven to One</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency): The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 10:00 AM today that the combined results achieved by the Japanese Army Air Force in the South Pacific area from the beginning of this year to mid-March are as follows: (1) Enemy aircraft losses: A. New Guinea area: 95 enemy aircraft shot down, 30 enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground; B. Solomon Islands area: 62 enemy aircraft shot down, 15 enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground; (2) Japanese losses: 30 aircraft. Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency): The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced today that from the beginning of this year to mid-March, the victory ratio of the Japanese Air Force against the U.S. Air Force in various battles in the South Pacific was seven to one. This indicates that the Imperial Air Force holds an absolute advantage in the region. According to reports from sources close to official circles, the Japanese Air Force is closely coordinating with the Navy, hence its remarkable achievements. Although the enemy has the latest and most sophisticated aircraft, such as P-38s, P-40s, P-30s, and Whirlwind fighters, as well as Flying Fortress fighters and bombers of various types, a total of 202 aircraft were still shot down or damaged by the Japanese Air Force. The skill and morale of the Japanese Air Force personnel are evident from this. It is also worth recalling that when Japanese troops entered New Guinea Island, the Air Force was able to build bases in the South Pacific. From April of this year, the Solomon Islands and other locations were used as the eastern defense line, uniting New Britain, New Guinea, and Guadalcanal as the front line, and establishing a strong forward base. From January 5th to 9th, the Japanese Air Force shot down 71 enemy aircraft in daily air battles. On February 4th alone, the Japanese Air Force shot down 29 enemy aircraft in the Solomon area before operations were completed. Two days later, another 29 aircraft were destroyed in the New Guinea area. During this period, the Japanese side lost only 30 aircraft, compared to the enemy's loss of 202 aircraft, resulting in a ratio of seven to one.</p>

<h3>Southern Tunisia: British Encirclement Plan Fails; Axis Forces Withdraw Completely into New Positions; First Army Offensive in the North Also Halted</h3>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency): Last night, Berlin military authorities announced that the Axis forces carried out a withdrawal on Sunday after the British attempted an encirclement in southern Tunisia, completely undetected by the enemy. According to yesterday's communiqué from the German High Command, the military operation was extremely successful. The majority of the withdrawing troops were Italian units. Because this withdrawal was undetected by the British, there were no losses. General Montgomery's attempt to encircle the Axis forces in the southern theater has now completely failed.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency): British forces in southern Tunisia increased pressure along the Mareth Line yesterday, hoping to concentrate their forces and break through the Axis defenses. The Axis forces also put up a very stubborn resistance. Although news from the British front line indicated progress in the northern Tunisian coastal area and at El Hamma, 40 kilometers west of Gabès, it also acknowledged that the Axis forces' resistance was extremely strong in all areas. British attacks were hampered by Axis counterattacks and bad weather in the north. A Reuters correspondent in northern Tunisia reported that the First Army had occupied several small hills, but the British advance was hindered by sudden rain and hail on Sunday. German sources claimed that the British forces assembled at Medjez el Bab, preparing to advance northeast and east, had been shattered by German artillery. However, the German command anticipated that the British forces in that area might launch another attack, as the First Army had recently received reinforcements.</p>
<h3>German Assessment: Soviet Winter Offensive Concluded</h3>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency): Last night, according to military authorities, although Soviet troops have resumed offensive operations in the northern sector of the eastern front, the large-scale Soviet winter offensive must be considered to have ended. According to a military correspondent for the Havas News Agency, the fighting on the eastern front has been quiet since the middle of last week and is continuing, indicating that neither the German nor Soviet sides are directly involved with a large number of troops.</p>
<h3>Allied Leaders to Meet in England</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency): According to sources in Washington, political circles there have learned that after President Roosevelt's meeting with British Foreign Secretary Eden, Allied leaders have scheduled a large-scale conference to be held in London. U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles, Chinese Ambassador to Britain Dr. Gu Weijun, Chinese Foreign Minister Song Ziwen, and Soviet Ambassador Maisky are all expected to participate in the meeting. The U.S. Ambassador to London, Mr. Winant, will return to his post in the next few days.</p>
<h3>The True Nature of the Anglo-Saxons (3)</h3>
<p>— Original Author: Tokutomi Iichiro</p>
<p>Haydn said:</p>
<p>"In France, virgins are chaste, wives are unsteady; in Holland, virgins are unsteady, wives are chaste; in England, both virgins and wives are unsteady."</p>
<p>This may be an overstatement. But we cannot help but keep these comments in mind. Thomas Jefferson, the drafter of the American Declaration of Independence, also said:</p>
<p>"Like the British government, immoral, arrogant, unreasonable, with a burning vanity and ambition, and an aspiration to dominate naval power, immersed in corruption and turbidity, we Americans cannot find a second nation that we dislike so intensely. We know that in the modern history of England, or among the advocates of British government doctrines and their implementation, it is useless to seek lessons on freedom or political significance. The merchant nation's doctrine is about money, not morality. Moreover, since England became known to the world for its commerce and corruption, until now, among the European nations, there is no country that lacks faith in its allies like England."</p>
<p>Suppose we resurrected Jefferson from the ground, and let him see the current situation—what is the state of his own country? What is the state of England? What is the alliance between his country and England? If we read his words carefully, they accurately predict the current situation of the United States and Britain and the relationship between the two axes. We take this opportunity to advise the current President Roosevelt to repeatedly study the words of Jefferson, one of the creators of the founding history.</p>
<p>Kant said:</p>
<p>"Perhaps there is no nation like the English that is so hateful, cruel, arrogant, and fond of war."</p>
<p>Luther, pointing at the English, said:</p>
<p>"Your country certainly has no wolves, but you yourselves are wolves."</p>
<p>Rousseau further said:</p>
<p>"The English praise themselves, praise their humanitarian spirit and the kindness of their people; but even if they shout as much as they want, I'm afraid few people will respond."</p>
<p>Finally, let us quote the words of George Washington, the founder of the United States. Washington said to the commander of the opposing British army:</p>
<p>"Our soldiers in your hands are receiving extremely inhumane treatment. If it were not for the charitable donations of local people, they would probably starve to death. Especially unreasonable is that you are incorporating our soldiers into your soldiers and forcing them to fight against me."</p>
<p>How do the Anglo-Saxons now treat the Japanese in the United States, India, Australia, and other areas under their sphere of influence? If Washington were to see this, what would he say? Do Americans not feel ashamed of their founder? Is it not that the British, after more than a hundred years, have not only not changed their old tyranny, but have become even more intensified?</p>
<p>(4) Corrupt Anglo-Saxons</p>
<p>Our predecessors were indeed deceived by the Anglo-Saxons. Yokoi Shonan regarded Washington as a modern Yao and Shun, and although he did not say that the United States was comparable to the Tang and Yu dynasties, he considered it to be close to its glory. He said that if he had his way, he would first propose world peace and seek the support of the American president. Also, Okubo Koto, from the end of the fourth year of Meiji until the first half of the sixth year, during his travels around the world, wrote to Nishi Tokujiro, who was studying in Russia at the time, saying, "Countries with cultures as advanced as England and France are difficult to emulate, so it is better to start by modeling ourselves after Germany or Russia. Therefore, I earnestly hope that you will thoroughly study the institutions and cultures of Russia," and so on. Not long ago, I was talking to a vice admiral in the Imperial Navy, who was an authority on naval history and naval tactics, and I said.</p>
<p>"Coming from England is corruption, but it's still fine, right?"</p>
<p>However, the admiral rose up in color and refuted my words, saying:</p>
<p>"No, no, definitely not corrupt."</p>
<p>As for politics, constitutional government is entirely based on England as its origin. Even if it is not completely modeled after them in legal terms, it is always regarded as the standard in its ideas and spirit. Just as when discussing the giants of world wealth, the Bank of England is mentioned first, when talking about the summit of constitutional government, the British Parliament is always considered to be the one. This is not only what the Japanese think, but the majority of the world is also deceived and blindly worships them, the only difference being the degree. Those who are deceived cannot escape being criticized for their ignorance, but it is also because there has never been seen anyone who is as good at official communication as the Anglo-Saxons. They are indeed a nation with the means to turn decay into something miraculous.</p>
<p>If the Japanese read through the history of England once, they would quickly be anesthetized and deceived! The history of England and the history of Japan are not very different in terms of chronology, but the history of Japan is that of a dynasty that lasts for ten thousand generations, with the imperial family being as eternal as heaven and earth. From the age of the gods to the present, it is like the flow of a great river, surging and vast, and with the progress of the times, the river becomes wider and more vast. However, the history of England has no consistency. If there is one, it is only the nature of pirates. Generally speaking, the history of England can be divided into three stages. The initial history is a history of being conquered by other nations. In Roman times, it was first conquered by Caesar, and then by Claudius. The impression of being conquered by Rome is still deeply ingrained. Chesterton said at the beginning of his book "History of England":</p>
<p>"What is most important about France and England is not the preservation of Roman relics. That is, France and England are no longer in the stage of preserving Roman relics, they themselves are Roman relics."</p>
<p>However, it was not only Rome that was the conqueror of England. Soon, it was the invasion of the so-called Anglo-Saxons. Next came the invasion of the Danes, and finally the attack of the Normans. The attack of the Normans was a watershed in the history of England in this period. And these Normans were originally a branch of the Danes who originally conquered England. But although they were born of the same root, they had been settled in Normandy, France, for a hundred years and had become almost French. Since their conquest of England, they made England entirely French, its language, literature, and writing all using French. And that William, who became the new conqueror, on the one hand, became the King of England in England, and on the other hand, became the Duke of Normandy, subordinate to the King of France.</p>
<p>The relationship between England and France was so closely linked. Afterwards, disputes between England and France continued endlessly. The French maiden Joan of Arc managed to drive the British forces out of the continent and return them to their original island nation.</p>
<p>However, England's becoming a great world empire was ultimately a gift from Joan of Arc. Why? It was because England withdrew from the continent, and its spirit of adventure turned to all parts of the world, leading to the acquisition of new territories.</p>
<p>In the second period, they were dedicated to internal affairs, and the king, nobles, and commoners fought with each other. At the same time, there were religious entanglements, which were constantly disturbing. But it was not until the third period that England reached out to the corners of the world. In all the conquered places, they used all kinds of evils and all kinds of conveniences to slowly advance, until today at the end of the twentieth century. In this way, they created a great empire with a population accounting for a quarter of the world and land accounting for a quarter of the world. If we say that England has a national spirit, then it is the spirit of pirates. England still holds privateering licenses, and once at war, it suddenly turns pirate behavior into a public license, allowing the people to engage in it on a large scale. What is called freedom is the exact opposite. During World War I, Wilson raised the issue of freedom of the seas, which made it difficult for England, and that was the reason.</p>
<p>The English constitutional government is thoroughly established by bribery. Walpole, an English constitutional politician who displayed unprecedented and unparalleled skill in English history, once said: "Everyone has their price." This means that he treats people as goods with price tags. As long as you pay, you can dispose of them at will. The so-called "pocket boroughs" mean that the great landlords of the British nobility could arbitrarily manipulate the electoral districts. Gladstone, who later became a leader of the Liberal Party, was initially elected from the Duke of Newcastle's "pocket borough". And the so-called "Reform Act," although it was said on the one hand to expand suffrage and on the other hand to crack down on corrupt elections, no matter what means or methods were used, it could not escape the reality of buying votes. It's just that magicians all know how to perform, but they have different skills. What the Japanese, standing far away, observe as the so-called ideal election, etc., in reality, there is no such thing in England.</p>
<p>What is unique about British elections is Joseph Chamberlain, who used the caucus method to appropriately adjust and assign votes in each electoral district of his party, thereby electing more parliamentarians than the number of voters. However, to do this kind of thing, party fees are the most necessary, so the victory or defeat of a political party depends entirely on how much party fees it can raise. As for how these party fees are obtained? It relies on large-scale contributions from Jews, as well as various corrupt tactics to raise money from sources other than Jews.</p>
<p>The most well-known method is selling peerages. Bagehot once pointed out the British peerage system and said:</p>
<p>"This is a method of regulating the nation's gold worship."</p>
<p>How can it be known that the peerage itself is a means of provoking gold worship? That is, the party cadres who have obtained political power see the target figures and sell peerages to them. Baronets, then barons, then viscounts, then earls, and even selling peerages higher than this. Horatio Bottomley exposed this in the "National Review," and Chesterton wrote about it in his "History of England".</p>
<p>If those who know the history of British political parties after the World War, how surprised they would be at the corruption of British political parties! Is the model of constitutional government so despicable? One must lament for it. Lloyd George's cabinet collapsed after the war, although there were many reasons, the most noteworthy being whether the money obtained by selling peerages by his cabinet should belong to Prime Minister Lloyd George or to the Conservative Party, which supported him and became the majority party?</p>
<p>Also, the Liberal Party, which shone brightly since the mid-nineteenth century, declined after the First World War. One of the most important reasons was whether the party fees obtained by selling peerages should be kept in Lloyd George's pocket or be openly given to the party cadres? The Asquith faction of the party argued that it should belong to the party itself. Lloyd George insisted that it should belong to him; even if it was given to the party, its distribution and use should be determined by him. Because of his insistence, the leaders of the Liberal Party turned against each other, eventually burying the party itself. It is just like gamblers fighting over the distribution of winnings, it is a ridiculous joke. Besides this, there are countless corrupt materials.</p>
<p>How can such materialistic Englishmen and Americans know the strength of Japan? Professor Chamberlain, who once lived in Japan for a long time, lectured on Japanese grammar, and knew the value of Japanese classics such as the Kojiki and Manyoshu, published a pamphlet after leaving Japan titled "The New Religion of Japan," saying: "The Genro of the Meiji Restoration are creating a new religion of loyalty to the emperor and patriotism." The Meiji Restoration was brought about by the spirit of loyalty to the emperor and patriotism, and it was not the Genro of the Meiji Restoration who created loyalty to the emperor and patriotism. This is self-evident to the Japanese. But I don't know what perspective he used to talk about the poems of the Otomo clan and the poems of the Sakimori? Like him, it cannot be said that his eyes are not blind, but his heart is blind. It is not surprising that the English and Americans initially despised Japan and thought that Japan would be easy to deal with, because they were misled by their materialistic mindset. But those who are intoxicated by the materialism of the Anglo-Saxons and worry about the future of Japan are also Anglo-Saxons at heart, even though they are Japanese. We sincerely pray that there will not be a single such person left in Japan. (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, March 16, 19, 20, 21, by Ding.)</p>

<h3>Commemorating the Third Anniversary of the National Government's Return to the Capital: Various Circles Hold Memorial Ceremonies; Municipal Government and Various People's Organizations Hold Separate Events; Shanghai Youth Corps Also Holds Grand Review Ceremony</h3>
<p>Yesterday (30th) morning at 10:00 AM, the Municipal Government held a ceremony at the Municipal Government Auditorium to celebrate the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. Mayor Chen personally presided over the event. Two national flags were hung high at the Municipal Government entrance on Avenue Albert, along with a long horizontal banner celebrating the event, and the surroundings were plastered with celebratory slogans. High-ranking officials from various bureaus, councils, district public offices, the Security Command, and the Shanghai branch of the Clearing and Suppression Committee attended on time. Representatives from Japan also participated in the grand ceremony. After Mayor Chen led the attendees in performing the rituals, he reported on the achievements of the National Government in the three years since its return to the capital and gave instructions and encouragement to his subordinates. The ceremony concluded after more than an hour.</p>
<p>General Assembly of Representatives from All Circles</p>
<p>Yesterday marked the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. Representatives from all circles in the city, convened by the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau, held a celebration assembly yesterday morning at 10:00 AM in the auditorium of the City Chamber of Commerce at Tianhou Palace. The ceremony was extremely grand. Approximately 700 units from agricultural, industrial, commercial, and academic organizations participated, totaling over a thousand people. The atmosphere was enthusiastic. Mr. Yuan Ludeng, a representative from the business community, presided over the meeting and delivered an opening speech, stating that it had been three years since the National Government's return to the capital. Holding a grand celebration on this commemorative day was of great significance. Chairman Wang Jingwei had led the peace movement for three years, during which he endured hardship, as was well known to the people of the country. As the Greater East Asia War was progressing, the return of the exclusive concessions was a powerful expression of sincere cooperation between China and Japan. Although the rise in the cost of living caused suffering for the people, the dawn of the nation had broken, and there was unlimited hope for the future. He hoped that everyone would bear the pain and cope with the current environment to achieve significant results for the nation. Subsequently, Mr. Zhao Zunyue, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, delivered a speech on behalf of Mayor Chen, stating that the concessions in the city would be recovered in a short period, and the nation's territorial sovereignty would be complete. However, the responsibilities would become even greater. He quoted Chairman Wang's announcement to the nation: "Love your country, love your neighbors, and love East Asia together." This was concise and to the point. East Asia belonged to the people of East Asia, and China belonged to the people of China. Everyone should strive to do their job well, promote the strength of the nation, and jointly shoulder the important task of defending Greater East Asia. Next, Mr. Zhou Huaren, a representative from the cultural community, delivered a speech. At this point, Mr. Yuan Shixing, Chairman of the Workers' Association, stood up and read out a telegram of respect to Chairman Wang, which was unanimously supported by all the representatives. The original telegram stated: "To Chairman Wang Jingwei of the Nanjing National Government: Three years have passed since the National Government's return to the capital. You have worked diligently, leading the people and laying the foundation of the nation on a solid foundation, promoting the prosperity of East Asia, and cooperating sincerely with our friendly neighbor, Japan, to eliminate the remaining forces of Britain and the United States. The people of Shanghai are celebrating the dawn of a new era. Today, representatives from all walks of life are gathered at 471 North Suzhou Road, Shanghai, to hold a celebration of the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. In an enthusiastic and solemn atmosphere, it was unanimously decided to extend to you our highest and most sincere respect. We respectfully submit this telegram, hoping for your wise consideration. The Shanghai Special City Representatives' Celebration Assembly for the Third Anniversary of the National Government's Return to the Capital bows in reverence." Finally, Yang Chong led the attendees in shouting slogans and adjourned the meeting.</p>
<p>People's Organizations' Assembly</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the New Citizens' Movement, the Shanghai Branch of the East Asia League, the Anti-British and American Association, and the Hongmen United Association mobilized various people's organizations to hold a celebration assembly at the Majestic Theatre in the afternoon. Over three thousand people attended. Mr. Chen Fumu, Secretary-General of the East Asia League, delivered an opening speech, emphasizing the achievements of the National Government in various fields in the three years since its return to the capital and the importance of close cooperation between China and Japan. Subsequently, Mr. Li Kaichen, a representative from the Hongmen United Association, and Mr. Chen Yafu from the Anti-British and American Association delivered speeches. Mr. Yuan Ludeng also rushed to the scene to briefly explain the significance of commemorating the return to the capital. A Japanese guest, Mr. Tatsichiro Funatsu, a representative from the East Asia Association, delivered a speech. Then, a telegram to the Chairman was read out, followed by a performance of Chinese martial arts, a screening of newsreels and films on peace and national construction, and the film "Cherish the Parting." The assembly concluded at 5:00 PM. The telegram to the Chairman from the assembly is recorded below: "Our China was on the verge of collapse, but fortunately, you advocated peace, taught harmonious relations between nations, stabilized society, revived China, led the people, and allied with East Asia. Since the return to the capital, for three years now, with your wisdom and decisiveness, you have declared war, defeated Britain and the United States, and built East Asia. We especially thank our friendly neighbor for respecting China, returning our sovereignty, establishing our glorious organizations, and your illustrious achievements will be forever recorded in national history."</p>
<p>Youth Corps Review</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the New Citizens' Movement Promotion Committee initiated a city-wide youth corps review held yesterday afternoon at the racecourse. Two large national flags were hung high in front of the entrance, and a review stand was erected in the central square, with red silk hung above, horizontally inscribed with "Shanghai Special City Youth Corps First Grand Review on the Third Anniversary of the Return to the Capital." A flagpole stood in front of the stand, and several loudspeakers were installed in the field. Starting at noon, the various youth corps entered the field one after another, lining up in their designated positions. The youth were dressed in neat uniforms and full of spirit. Guests and officials attending the review included Zhao Zunyue, Lin Jiongan, Yuan Ju, Zhang Kechang, Pan Da, Zhou Huaren, Feng Jie, Lu Ying, and others. On the Allied side, those present were the head of the Public Works Department, Ogasaki, Secretary Hirokawa representing Minister Tajiri, and Lieutenant Colonel Aoyama representing the Commander of the Naval Special Landing Forces. At the chime of two o'clock, the grand review began. To the sound of melodious music, the reviewing officers took their seats one after another, and the review ceremony began. Commander-in-Chief Chen led the officials and guests around the field. Then, all the youth lined up and marched past the review stand, their steps exceptionally orderly. After the review was completed, the city corps establishment ceremony began. After performing the rituals, Commander-in-Chief Chen gave instructions, followed by the youth corps representatives presenting their oaths, and finally, the meeting was adjourned with slogans.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of the Shanghai Huxiang District Party Affairs Office of the Chinese Kuomintang and the political work corps of the Clearing and Suppression Committee, district-level people's celebration assemblies were held in the Nanhui, Fengxian, and Beiqiao districts, as well as in Zhoupu town.

Additionally, the Shanghai Special City Second Special District Party Department of the Chinese Kuomintang organized thirty-five lecture teams to set off at 9:00 AM yesterday to give lectures in the Nanshi, Huxi, Zhabei, and Pudong districts.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Announces: 31st Period Household Ration; Two and a Half Sheng of Rice, One and a Half Jin of Flour</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council has issued a notice stating that the 30th set of coupons for rice and flour certificates is only valid until the 30th of this month and will be invalid after the expiration date. From April 2nd to April 9th, rice shops and the council's rice sales points will issue rice and flour based on the 31st set of coupons for rice and flour certificates. At that time, rice shops with registered numbers marked on the coupons will issue half a sheng of broken rice and two sheng of white rice (or brown rice) per rice certificate coupon, with a total price of 7.5 yuan. Additionally, each flour certificate coupon will be used to issue one jin of first-class flour and half a jin of second-class flour, priced at 3.5 yuan. Furthermore, on April 1st and 10th, all rice shops and the council's rice sales points will be closed for one day.</p>
<h3>Edible Oil to be Sold; Exact Date to be Determined</h3>
<p>The sale of edible oil in the city was previously decided by the Edible Oil Traders' Wholesale Association, based on the purchase of oil with house donation tickets and household registration certificates. It is heard that sales will begin within the day. According to the person in charge of the association, the sales method will be much more complete than before. The amount of oil sold by each retail store must be listed separately, indicating the security district, house donation ticket number, and the buyer's name, to avoid private malfeasance.</p>
<h3>Foreign Schools Established by the Bureau; Classes Officially Start Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The foreign schools established by the Public Works Department, after undergoing reorganization, have been scheduled to officially resume classes tomorrow (1st). According to Ueno, the Education Supervisor of the Public Works Department, the boys' school (Seymour Road) will hold classes every morning, while the girls' school (Haig Road) will hold classes every afternoon. So far, the number of new and old students enrolled in the two schools has exceeded 320, and 48 teachers have been hired. However, the teachers at the girls' school are required to be female, and male teachers are hired to teach at the boys' school.</p>
<h3>Director of Information Department Hirota Hosts Journalist Reception, Criticizes Britain for Deceiving Small Countries</h3>
<p>At the routine meeting for foreign journalists hosted by the Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office yesterday, Director of Information Department Hirota mentioned the postwar issues currently under discussion, the postwar status of small nations, and the infighting among the Allied nations. He stated that according to the Atlantic Charter, small nations could obtain limited freedom, but powerful nations still oppressed small countries and forced them to obey their orders. The anti-German policies adopted by Poland and Czechoslovakia before the war were due to Britain's promise to provide assistance and restore their original status after the war. Yugoslavia and Greece also fell into this trap. However, observing the current situation of these small countries, it is clear whether Britain has kept its promises. Regardless of the outcome of the Allies' discussions, what we should pay attention to is how Britain continues to implement its policy of bullying small countries. The Allies' discussions are only concerned with the interests of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, while Chongqing lags behind. Britain's policy of betrayal has been applied to every race in the world based on the following shameful facts: (1) In 1915, Britain promised Italy rights on the opposite shore of the Adriatic Sea, but in the Treaty of Versailles, Italy's desires were almost entirely ignored by Britain. (2) Britain also promised freedom and independence to the Arabs who were resisting Turkey. (3) At the same time, Britain promised France territorial rights in the Near East. (4) Britain especially promised Palestine as a homeland for the Jews. Britain has never fulfilled any of these four promises. Britain has essentially "sold one piece of land to several buyers." Mr. Hirota continued to discuss Britain's policy towards Japan. He stated that in 1905, Japan and Britain concluded an alliance with the expectation that Japan would participate in the war for Britain. In 1922, at the Washington Conference, Britain broke the alliance and became closely aligned with the United States. After World War I, President Wilson's Fourteen Points were disregarded by Britain in the Treaty of Versailles, and Germany suffered the pain of dismemberment, while Japan, Germany, and Italy suffered the same fate. He concluded by saying that in light of the above, small countries and Chongqing under British influence should be careful not to fall into this trap again.</p>
<h3>Advertisements Detrimental to City Appearance to be Banned</h3>
<p>According to news obtained by a Datong News Agency reporter, since the local authorities resolved to rectify the appearance of the city, work on repairing roads and cleaning up garbage has been actively underway. It is also heard that excessively long signboards detrimental to the city's appearance, obscene advertisements that damage dignity, and meaningless promotional flyers will be banned.</p>
<h3>Tram Operation; Express Tram</h3>

<h3>Authorities Reaffirm Determination to Enforce Meat Price Controls; Measures to Suppress Vegetable Prices Expected to be Announced Soon</h3>
<p>Regarding the suppression of commodity prices in vegetable markets in various districts of the city, the relevant authorities have repeatedly held meetings to discuss measures. Last winter, strict price controls were implemented on meat, and the activities of brokers who manipulate meat prices were also restricted by the authorities. However, recently, some pork merchants have attempted to stir up trouble again. Therefore, the authorities will reaffirm their determination to control prices and punish those who illegally seek profit. As for vegetable prices, due to the unstable sources and transportation, it is more difficult to implement fixed price controls. However, within the possible scope, a decision has been made to suppress vegetable prices. Specific measures are expected to be announced and implemented soon.</p>
<h3>City Residence Permits to Stop Being Issued Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The period for issuing city residence permits has been set by the City Police Headquarters to end at the end of this month. Recently, due to the approaching deadline, the number of people applying for and receiving permits in districts such as Nanshi, Pudong, and Zhabei has increased dramatically. Once the deadline expires, extensions will no longer be granted.</p>

Yesterday, this newspaper's broadcasting time was 6:40 PM.</p>
<h3>Economic Circle</h3>
<p>The Huazhong Tobacco Distribution Association hereby notifies all wholesale and retail merchants that they must comply with the regulations and must not violate the association's rules; otherwise, the association will impose penalties in accordance with the signed pledge. The most important of the rules established by the association authorities are that there must be no hoarding or refusal to sell, the right to wholesale tobacco must not be transferred to others, and the business location must not be moved without the approval of the association.</p>
<h3>Commentary on Rice Prices Plunging</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association and the easing of restrictions on the movement of materials, the black market price of rice in the Shanghai concession area has plummeted. This development is very sound and reasonable, because from now on the lives of the vast majority of our citizens can be much more stable. As rice prices fell, other commodity prices also tended to fall: egg prices fell, tea prices fell, and soap prices fell even more.</p>
<p>As the black market prices of all commodities tend to fall along with rice, speculators and hoarders became anxious and started making up rumors again, such as that after the new issuance of military currency was stopped, the reserve currency would expand, and the exchange rate of the reserve currency against the North China Allied Bank currency would fall, etc., hoping to shake the psychology of the easily startled Shanghai people again and to buy rice again and exchange currency for goods again. In fact, judging from the common sense, after the new issuance of military currency is stopped, the demand for reserve currency increases, that is, its usefulness increases, that is, its value or purchasing power increases, which is also inevitable. Since the Japanese yen is worth the same as the Allied banknotes, the statutory ratio between the Japanese yen and the reserve banknotes is naturally 18 and 100, which is a natural principle, so where is the depreciation of the reserve banknotes?</p>
<p>After rice prices fell, the prices of all commodities tended to fall, so the black market prices of gold and cotton yarn should not continue to rise. Gold is the most useless thing in wartime, it cannot be worn for warmth, it cannot be eaten when hungry, and the most abundant material in Central China is cotton yarn, so the rise in gold and yarn prices is the most unreasonable phenomenon. Thinking about it, the authorities will eventually have amazing measures to completely eradicate this.</p>
<h3>Circular from the Banking and Money Industry: Implementing a Unified Currency Policy</h3>
<p>The Banking and Money Industry Association yesterday issued a circular to its member banks and firms: "The following is a direct translation of Finance Ministry Qian No. 74: The government, in order to unify the currency, implemented the reorganization of old currency in May of last year. At that time, the exchange rate between Central Reserve Bank notes and military currency was agreed with friendly nations to be 18 yuan of military currency for 100 yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes. Recently, our government announced its participation in the war, and friendly nations, in order to strengthen our wartime economic policies, have once again sought thorough cooperation on our country's currency issue. Therefore, it has been decided to resolutely abolish the new issuance of military currency from April 1 of this month, and the expenditure of it in the Chinese national treasury, as well as the payment of bank deposits, loans, remittances, etc., will no longer use military currency. From now on, the exchange rate between Central Reserve Bank notes and Japanese yen will still remain at 100 yuan to 18 yuan. In addition to the remarks made by the Headquarters Asia Branch, this order is urgently issued to your association to quickly inform all colleagues that from April 1 of this year, all national treasury expenditures using military currency must be changed to Central Reserve Bank notes, and banks and money firms must not use military currency for the payment of deposits, loans, remittances, etc. This matter concerns the progress of the unified currency policy, so all must abide by it." From now on, from April 1, payments such as deposits, loans, and remittances from banks and firms will no longer be able to use military currency.</p>
<h3>Strict Limits by Two Authorities; Cigarette Merchants Selling at Reduced Prices</h3>
<p>Since the authorities of the two concessions implemented price controls on cigarettes, some retail cigarette shops still disobey and fail to comply with the regulations. Initially, they made excuses that the cigarettes had not been delivered, but now they claim, "Today's low-priced cigarettes are already sold out," and post a paper sign at the store entrance, preventing ordinary customers from buying low-priced cigarettes. Some are even secretly raising prices by one or two dimes. It is learned that the authorities have decided to take strict action to ensure that all cigarette merchants comply with the order to sell at reduced prices. Special agents have been secretly dispatched to investigate. At the same time, the authorities have also decided to suppress the prices of other daily necessities, such as "soap, candles, and matches." It is heard that the investigation work is currently being actively carried out to reduce the burden on citizens.</p>
<h3>Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry Holds Regular General Meeting; Chairman Aoki Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch: The Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry held its regular general meeting on the 29th at the Japanese Club. At the meeting, Chairman Aoki delivered a speech, outlining the directions the Chamber should follow in the future, considering: (1) Breaking away from reliance on Britain and the United States; (2) Making China a modern country; and (3) Establishing a sound economic system as three key points. The foundation for breaking away from reliance on Britain and the United States has been laid due to the elimination of British and American influence in China. The third point, establishing a sound economic system, is not yet in place. The second point, making China a modern country, must wait until the economic system is established. Furthermore, the construction of an economic Shanghai is necessary, such as the restrictions on the movement of goods in the lower Yangtze River region, and the establishment of a unified control organization, the National General Association for Commercial Control, for the establishment of purchasing and distribution agencies in Central China, etc., are all economic systems adapted to the new situation. These new economic policies are indeed epoch-making transformations. Chinese and Japanese financial circles should always maintain a fair stance, based on the great righteousness of humility and mutual assistance as good neighbors, adapt to national policies, and complete the goal of building an economic Shanghai. In addition, the changes and impacts of the new economic policies will involve production, distribution, purchasing, trade, currency, prices, etc., which are extremely complex. The scope of responsibility of the Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry will inevitably be large. Currently, the National General Association for Commercial Control has entrusted the Chamber to handle matters such as the registration of related commodities, and it seems that the Consulate General has internally decided to transfer a large amount of food rice distribution to the Chamber for implementation.</p>
<h3>Deliberations on the Implementation of Commercial Control (1)</h3>
<p>— Gao Xun</p>
<p>Recently, the National General Association for Commercial Control was established in Shanghai to handle national material control matters. From this point on, our country has formally entered the economic stage of controlled policies from the economic stage of liberalism. This is indeed a noteworthy event in our country's economic history. For control is a new policy, and to manage control through the method of merchant autonomy is another form of control. Since there are few established rules and no precedents, what effective methods should be adopted to fulfill its mission? This has considerable research value in theory. In recent days, attention from all parties has been focused on this. Merchants and citizens are pondering, and some even say that this kind of commercial control is a restrictive free economic system, because the current methods follow administrative practices, focusing on the issuance of licenses, while the implementation methods of the entire control have not yet been clearly announced, leading to different opinions and various speculations. Currently, the following four points should be given priority attention in the implementation of commercial control, which will be discussed separately as follows:</p>
<p>(1) A wide range of investigations and detailed statistics should be carried out: Controlled economy is also known as planned economy, so control places the most importance on planning; if there is no plan, it cannot be effective, which is extremely obvious. For example, controlling production is not limited to managing production enterprises and their organizations, but also requires weighing total production and total consumption, including the raw materials, labor supply, investment interest, and enterprise profits required for production, as well as the quantity of consumption and the limits of savings. Only then can an overall plan be made to seek production that meets both civilian and military consumption needs, in order to achieve the purpose of controlled production. Similarly, implementing distribution is not limited to distributing existing materials, but also requires observing the elasticity of consumption based on existing materials and materials that may be increased in the short term, distinguishing between urgent and non-urgent needs, and coordinating allocation, in order to achieve the purpose of controlled distribution. Considering the complexity of the current economic society, it is not easy to thoroughly understand the above situations in order to make overall plans. Although the presiding personnel have profound academic knowledge and rich experience, and jointly plan in detail, it is appropriate to share the responsibility. However, the thinking of a small number of people is limited by subjectivity and estimation. Although the initial facilities can also achieve superficial achievements, there will inevitably be times of incoordination in the entire process of control, and objective data must be used as the basis. However, in order to obtain reliable objective data, a wide range of investigations and detailed statistics must be carried out. According to the current organization of the General Association of Commercial Control, it seems that such an institution should be established. I suggest setting up a special statistics office to recruit specialized personnel to manage it, so that responsibility can be assigned and its effectiveness observed.</p>
<h3>Dynamics of Essential Goods</h3>
<p>Salt</p>
<p>Salt, like rice, is an essential commodity for stabilizing people's livelihoods. The people under the rule of Chongqing have been suffering from salt shortages for the past five years since the incident, because the source of sea salt was cut off, and the people have suffered unspeakably. However, under the rule of the National Government, because there is abundant production of Haizhou salt and Yuyao salt, although there was a salt shortage during the war, it soon returned to peace. Today, the people under the rule of the National Government no longer feel a shortage of salt.</p>
<p>The Haizhou salt field is the largest salt field in Central China and has long since returned to its former state, with a very sound distribution system. The Central China Salt Industry Company has been established for more than five years, during which time it has suffered from floods and attacks by communist bandits. However, the Central China Salt Industry Company, undaunted by great difficulties, has worked hard to revive it, and the current salt production exceeds the planned amount, with excellent results.</p>
<p>In addition, there are countless salt fields in the Zhoushan Islands and Yuyao, which are comparable to the Haizhou salt fields in Central China. The production is large and benefits Central China greatly. The Central China Salt Industry Company purchases more salt, in addition to Haizhou, Zhoushan, and Yuyao, it also imports from Hainan Island. The distribution agency in Central China is the Yuhua Company, which is jointly formed by general old salt merchants. The company was established in December of the year before last, and was given the exclusive privilege of one shop in the entire Central China region. Before the establishment of the company, it was originally exclusively sold by Tongyuan Salt Industry Company. Later, Yuhua Company was established, and Tongyuan was dissolved, and all powers were transferred to Yuhua Salt Industry Company.</p>
<p>The Yuhua Salt Industry Company's distribution system for general civilian needs is determined according to the conditions in various places. Direct sales offices or official salt warehouses are established in places equivalent to ordinary wholesale. If there is a cooperative in this place, it is directly issued to the cooperative, and the people can purchase high-quality salt at the lowest price.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there are six major distribution points, and each distribution point distributes salt to shops. However, if there is a large need for Hakka families, they can purchase directly from the distribution point without going through the hands of the salt shop. For the distribution to Japanese residents, a special Hongkou office has been set up, and Japanese retail shops are distributed by the office. There are offices in the Shanghai surrounding areas, including Pudong and Nanchuan. If there are transportation inconveniences, they are sold through direct or semi-operated salt warehouses. In the cleared areas, there are strict restrictions on the movement of goods, so the distribution system in the cleared areas is different from that in the general interior. Branch companies are set up in Changshu, Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou to distribute salt to the salt shops in the towns and villages under their jurisdiction. Small-scale retail stores are set up in remote areas. (Continental News, March 21)</p>

<h3>Defects and Hopes</h3>
<p>— Luo Chaifu</p>
<p>"Everything that grows and succeeds in the world is mostly produced by "defects." Without defects, the world would become a "dead" world, a monotonous world. Just imagine, if the world were forever "flowers blooming, the moon round, and people living long lives," although on the surface it would be "perfect," the world would therefore stagnate and stop progressing. Then what meaning and value of life would there be to speak of?</p>
<p>"The meaning of life" is to be revealed in defects. Without "illness," one would not know the preciousness of health. Without tasting "bitterness," one would not know the value of joy. Without understanding contradictions, one would not understand the true taste of "a life of creation"... And these "illnesses," "bitterness," "contradictions"... are what are called the defects of life.</p>
<p>The value of life is to exist in "hope." With "hope," there is effort and struggle. With struggle, there is success. And only those who are successful know the "value of life."</p>
<p>Therefore, what enriches life is "hope," and what produces "hope" is "defects." Hope and defects are born together. The more defects there are, the greater the hope. Because there were defects in the past, there is a need for the development of history. Because there are defects now, there is a need to work hard to improve. But what about the future? Of course, there will also be defects in the future, so hope is endless. Its power is also unlimited.</p>
<p>The relationship between "defects" and "hope" is to seek "hope" in "defects," not to seek "hope" for the sake of "hope." Seeking hope from defects means that hope has its realistic basis. If hope is a "dream" that is beyond "reality," then it can never be realized.</p>
<p>True "perfection" in the world is not absolute perfection, but relative "perfection." Relative perfection is based on "defects." "Defects" want it to be perfect, and must grow in realistic "hope."</p>
<h3>Symposium on Human Organs</h3>
<p>— Ling Zuren</p>
<p>Date: A late spring night in a year of suffering.</p>
<p>Characters: Mouth, eyes, hands, eyebrows, feet, waist, shoulders, ears, nose...</p>
<p>Mouth: (Opens with a sigh!) In this day and age, broken rice and vegetable soup have dulled my senses so much that I can't even distinguish the taste of anything. It's truly a case of "not knowing the taste of meat for three months."</p>
<p>Eyes: Right! In these past few months, have I ever seen a piece of meat?</p>
<p>Mouth: Let's not talk about enjoyment. Even when speaking, it's all about hardship and poverty. I haven't said a single happy or interesting word.</p>
<p>Hands: Isn't that right! I've been working harder and more diligently than before. Although I'm earning more money than before, I always seem to be "spending more than I earn." No wonder my hands are sighing about hardship.</p>
<p>Eyebrows: You just need to look at me, always squeezed together on my face, with a look of worry and suffering, which fully expresses the poor state of our master's life.</p>
<p>Feet: I'm the one who's really out of luck. For the sake of livelihood, I'm running around all day long. Although I'm exhausted, I still have to run. The road seems like it will never end.</p>
<p>Waist: Ah! You're running around for a living, but am I not also being suppressed by it! Look! The burden of life has bent me over, and I can't stand up straight anymore.</p>
<p>Shoulders: You're only indirectly affected! I'm directly bearing this heavy burden. The weight I'm bearing is truly a hundred or a thousand times greater than yours.</p>
<p>Ears: Okay! Okay! I'm tired of hearing your complaints. When will we be able to escape from hardship? -</p>
<p>Nose: "Every year is difficult, but every year passes." Let's work hard to challenge this year of suffering! Defeat it! Overcome it! I believe that as long as we can all understand the times, recognize our responsibilities, strive, and work hard, then we can obtain permanent stability in life. Don't worry, because I've already smelled a breath of "new life." We just need to work hard, and we can obtain it. The current hardships are truly a practice for future stability!</p>
<p>Mouth, eyes, hands, eyebrows, feet, waist, shoulders, (in unison): Right! Right! We should work hard! Strive, and take on our respective responsibilities to strive for a stable life.</p>
<p>A rooster crowing in the distance startles them. ... Mouth, eyes, hands, eyebrows, feet, waist, shoulders, ears, nose are all waiting in silence.</p>
<h3>Spring Musings</h3>
<p>— Shu Sheng</p>
<p>When spring has not yet arrived, many people use great enthusiasm to look forward to the arrival of spring, but when spring comes, they do not implement their plans. It can be seen that expectations are all hypocritical, only practical work is true. People who do not expect have already completed great work while others are expecting!</p>
<p>The sunshine of spring not only gives people warmth and relaxation, but also gives flowers and plants the opportunity to develop freely; this is indeed the power of spring, and this is the difference between spring and winter.</p>
<p>As long as there are living plants, they all wake up under the caress of the spring breeze. They are unwilling to let go of the good opportunity, growing longer day and night, and will soon return to their former state; this is really a good lesson for those who procrastinate! Although the success of people cannot be as rapid as the progress of plants, as long as they keep working hard, success is a certain reward!</p>
<p>Spring scenery often evokes memories of past happiness in most people (even in newspapers and magazines, we can often see articles recalling past happiness!). At first, I didn't know that the past is gone, and remembering can only increase more troubles, and can never become a reality. To get real happiness, you can only work hard in hardships, then the happiness after future success will definitely be many times greater than the happiness in memories!</p>
<h3>Cleaning Work</h3>
<p>— Tian Mingzuo</p>
<h3>What Does It Matter!</h3>
<p>— Xiao Luo</p>
<p>There are some people in the world: they sit comfortably in a splendidly decorated bedroom, raising their heads supported by a snow-white stiff collar and shouting loudly: "We must be patient, we must endure hardship, we must work hard, we must..."</p>
<p>However, there are other people: they struggle and persevere in the muddy path of life, covered with wounds, lowering their heads, step by step, silently walking towards the road to success.</p>
<p>These are two completely dissimilar kinds of people. Society's attitude and treatment towards them seems to be:</p>
<p>The former are gentlemen! (Actually, they are selfish and hypocritical)</p>
<p>The latter are petty people! (Actually, they are practical and dedicated to public service)</p>
<p>However, what does it matter? We must not be discouraged by this point, or shake the "confidence" that we have not been able to cultivate easily. Truth is eternal! It is only temporarily obscured!</p>
<h3>Root</h3>
<p>— Xin Bo</p>
<p>"Good, good, I'll go with you. Then come to my house after going down the mountain." Da Gen's interest was piqued, and he immediately agreed.</p>
<p>"Haha, what about your manure bucket?" A Wu laughed, "Are you carrying a manure bucket to go sightseeing?"</p>
<p>"That doesn't matter, I just need to shout, and Er Gen will come and carry it back."</p>
<p>Da Gen said, and walked a few steps towards the northwest, to a place where he could see the foot of the mountain. He stopped and shouted loudly at a person carrying two heavy manure buckets: "Er Gen, Er Gen!" When the person below raised his head, he gestured and said: "You carry it up! And carry the two empty ones back together, I want to accompany Brother A Wu to Lingshan."</p>
<p>Da Gen and Er Gen were originally taking turns carrying the buckets. Er Gen carried them from the pit to the foot of the mountain, and he carried them from the foot of the mountain to the top. Er Gen responded and continued to carry the buckets with his head down.</p>
<p>"How old is Er Gen this year? Can he carry it up the mountain?" A Wu asked.</p>
<p>"Seventeen years old. He can rest along the way." As he spoke, Da Gen walked over and inserted the carrying pole into the mulberry field, and added to A Wu: "Let's go."</p>
<p>"That will delay your work."</p>
<p>"What does it matter."</p>
<p>They walked into the crowd.</p>
<p>"It seems that there were more rose fields last year, why are there fewer this year?" A Wu asked casually.</p>
<p>"Because there is no market for rose flowers, so everyone removed them and planted mulberry trees and sweet potatoes instead. It seems that silk will be expensive this year. I heard that many silkworm cocoons were burned in Shanghai last year..."</p>
<p>They walked side by side, chatting along the way. Soon, they reached the top of Little Lingshan, next to a large stone wall. Some water had accumulated in a depression at the base of the wall, and many children were squatting down and dipping their fingers in the water to moisten their eyes, supposedly to cure eye diseases. Then they stood up and lightly touched the soles of their shoes on the surface of the water, supposedly to make the shoes more durable when wet.</p>

<h3>Medical Aid Fund for Primary School Teachers; Mr. Jiang Shangda Generously Donates 20,000 Yuan; Special Agreements with Hospitals to be Responsible for Diagnosis and Treatment</h3>
<p>This newspaper's "Medical Aid Fund for Primary School Teachers" has repeatedly received enthusiastic support from all walks of life, contributing money and effort. Yesterday, we received a letter from Mr. Jiang Shangda, General Manager of Minfeng Textile Mill, generously donating 20,000 yuan to the Medical Aid Fund, which has already been gratefully received. We hereby express our gratitude. Mr. Jiang's concern for poor and sick teachers and his promotion of the spirit of mutual assistance are admirable. We deeply hope that people from all walks of life will continue to respond and complete this task.</p>
<p>Special Agreement Hospitals</p>
<p>The Medical Aid Fund Committee for Primary and Secondary School Teachers of this newspaper has received letters from various hospitals with special agreements saying: We are grateful to Mr. Huang for personally sending a bank check for 10,000 yuan to subsidize medical services for primary school teachers. In addition, Xin Ya Pharmaceutical Factory has donated medicines worth 2,500 yuan to meet the needs of those who come to the hospital for treatment, which is even more appreciated. Our hospitals have always been committed to serving the common people, and we do our best for those who seek treatment for poverty and illness, without any boundaries. However, both the Women and Children's Hospitals mainly focus on obstetrics and gynecology, followed by pediatrics. Although the hospital addresses are slightly to the west, the gardens and buildings are quite large, the treatment is strict, and the service is loyal, without relying on false reputation, which may also be welcomed by those seeking treatment. This newspaper's introduction of primary school teachers to our hospitals for treatment will certainly be given extra medical treatment, administering medicine, and early recovery, continuing to teach and benefit children. Medical expenses are currently extremely expensive, and it is already difficult for poor teachers to seek medical treatment and purchase medicine, let alone allow the illness to prolong. Our hospitals serve compatriots, treating everyone equally. The treatment of each illness will be reported later. Pan Da, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Tongren Hospital and Hongren Hospital, Wang Yijing, President of the Hospital, Kuang Cuie, President of Ximen Women and Children's Hospital, and Wang Yihui, President of Pingmin Women and Children's Hospital.</p>
