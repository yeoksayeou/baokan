<p>社評</p>
<h3>祝菲律賓獨立</h3>
<p>「有志者，事竟成」。二百餘年以來，為爭取自由與獨立，而繼續不斷奮鬥的菲律賓人，終於完成其夙願。今天是菲律賓共和國成立的一日，今後菲律賓將為大東亞共榮圈有力的一員。他們的前途，充滿着光明。</p>
<p>菲律賓獨立準備委員會，業已完成建立國家基礎的歷史任務，制定憲法。首任大總統洛勒爾氏今日就任。三百年來，菲律賓無數的愛國志士，流著寶貴鮮血的獨立大理想，一旦實現，一千八百萬菲島人民，衷心的欣幸，是多麽的興奮！</p>
<p>美國在形式上也曾對菲律賓約期許其獨立。依麥克泰飛法案的規定，在一九四六年七月四日予以獨立。其始美國之欲菲律賓倂入版圖，當時國內雖有强硬的反對者。但美國經濟界，因熱中於發展東亞市塲的慾望，支援菲律賓合併主張，以作侵略亞洲之踏脚石。對這金元帝國主義主張强硬的反對者，為農民及勞働者。他們說：「菲律賓的合併，不過是美國的負擔。」果然，此後事態的推移，證明農民及勞働者的見解是正確的。因為菲律賓的經營，須支付極高代價的犧牲，美國為維持菲島的財政，不能不支付相當高的價値，每年從菲律賓輸入達百萬噸的砂糖。此外，美國又需以特高的價格，每年輸入椰乾核，麻，及其他物資。</p>
<p>因為如此巨量物資的輸入，並不為着需要。在美國的生產者方面，尤其是很多投資於爪哇及古巴的糖產事業者，遭遇了很大的犧牲。因此，投資糖業者及一般農民，對於菲律賓的經營，表示極度的不滿。此外，菲律賓人移入美境太平洋沿岸地方者，每年輙以百萬計，僱工較廉，因此也遭受美國勞動界的反對。但在美當局以菲律賓保持為其領土之時，情勢上不可能阻止菲律賓人的移入，於是勞働界對於保持菲律賓一事，竟至於表示異議。</p>
<p>美國農民和勞働界視菲律賓為累贅，而開始主張放棄，這種矛盾事實，原是極好的機會，給與菲律賓人民，逐漸孕育獨立運動，於是向以擁護農民及勞働界利益的民主黨政府，遂給予菲律賓允許獨立的遠期支票。</p>
<p>然而美國所尤許的獨立，究竟包含什麽意義呢？美國統治菲律賓二十餘年，極力麻醉菲律賓人，造成完全寄生蟲的性格。使他們吃美國的食品，穿著美國製的衣服，駕駛美國製的汽車，講美國話，做着美國式的遊藝，在種種環境中同化菲律賓人。於是菲律賓人逐漸向美國主義轉變，使百分之百的依存美國製品，日常生活上必要的物品，如果美國一日不輸入，就一日不能生活。這事態是美國經濟界所希望的。所以一旦造成了上述菲島人完全依存美國商品基礎之後，美國經濟界以為菲島在政治上是否依存於美國，則不成問題。因此，美國經濟界也不强硬反對獨立法案了。</p>
<p>從上面的觀察，我們敢說菲律賓問題的焦點，是在於菲律賓人自身方面。就是他們怎樣能够在經濟上，財政上，進行其獨立的準備，而脫出於依存美國的範疇。</p>
<p>根據美國決定的獨立法案，規定從菲律賓獨立之日起，全部停止一切財政的援助，如輸入砂糖和椰乾核等之外，並制定菲列賓移民的禁止。菲列賓人除被剝奪了一切利益之外，更被强迫著幾種條件。例如：規定菲律賓的政治形態須為美國式虛僞民主主義的共和國，公立學校採用美國語，甚至於要求保留海軍根據地。</p>
<p>美國所企圖者，使菲律賓成為一個小美國的雛形。美國人很明白菲律賓人是具有亞細亞環境的東方民族的事實。那麽美國人為什麼對這不同環境下的異民族，强制化學着美國的政治組織與生活方式呢？美國人如其眞正給予菲律賓人的幸福與繁榮，他們為什麽不容許菲律賓人有最適於他們的傳統和環境的政治形態與生活方式呢？實在因為美國始終沒有容許獨立自由的可能性。美國人不能拋棄間接的支配菲列賓，同時不能拋棄以菲列賓為美國製品獨佔市塲的慾望。在美國的計劃中，對於菲雜賓獨立，包含着假仁義的要素。這是應當指出的。</p>
<p>現在菲律賓人不再呻吟於暴虐和虛僞的美國主義的壓迫下了，獲得了眞正的自由和獨立，在大東亞新秩序的形勢之下，為大東亞的一員，而接受了前途無限發展與繁榮的機會。我們不勝為菲律賓人民表示慶幸，同時更為大東亞共榮前途表示慶幸。</p>
<p>我們中國旅居菲律賓的僑民，人數雖不甚多，而在經濟界佔有相當重要的地位。在此菲律賓獨立完成，全國更新的今後；同時，在大東亞各國協力爭取勝利，完成新秩序的今後，我們希望旅菲僑胞賡續以往的努力，協助當地政府共同促進菲律賓共和國的繁榮與興盛。</p>

<h3>汪主席談話</h3>
<p>南京十三日中央社電　菲律賓已定於今（十四日）宣佈獨立，國府汪主席為此特發表談話如下：菲律賓一千八百萬民衆所期待之光榮獨立，巳於今日實現，我人以東亞同志立塲，　　無限慶祝之忱。英美兩國對我東亞肆行侵略，歷時巳久，東亞許多民族及其國家被英國奴役而桎梏之衆所　曉。菲律賓亦於美國垂　之下供其犧牲，菲律賓民族雖時時奮起反美運動，但終因美國之强力壓迫，未能達其目的，大東亞戰爭之意　，在於擊　英美，解放東亞。由友邦日本將士之英勇戰果，巳將英美侵略勢力，逐出於大東亞領域之外，以往受英美壓追榨取之大東亞諸民族，遂獲致復興機運、菲律賓共和國之建立，亦以此復興機運達到成功。吾人於慶祝菲律賓共和政府完成之餘，並向友邦日本英勇戰士致其敬意。吾人並願東亞諸次邦曁諸同胞，精誠團結，本共　　榮之觀念，努力奮鬥，以獲致大東亞戰爭最後之勝利。</p>
<h3>伐爾加斯聲明</h3>
<p>馬尼剌十三日中央社電　菲島行政長官伐爾加斯氏，以獨立宣言即將發表，特於十二日經由同　社發表長文聲明，茲錄其要旨如次：盟邦日本帝國已對菲律賓賦興起草　　，確立行政機構之自由　今日菲島首要之政治問題，為國內行政之完備，其他基本重要問題，即為國防，余敢謂菲島人無不希望祖國之獨立與政府之安定者，我等菲人基於保陪國家安全之原則，與東亞各民族協力，今除日本帝國外，大東亞任何國家均不能抵禦外敵，防衛祖國，然東亞各國家若於日本指導下，實行大同團結，則無懼外敵侵入與敗北之必要。此次菲島成為大東亞共榮圈之一環，實現獨立，其政治意義即在於此，菲島獨立之經濟意義，早經愼重檢討，巳無重述必要，菲島經濟加入大東亞共榮圈，並與東亞各國實行經濟協力，始得獲得本身繁榮。獨立菲島第一，須謀食糧衣服等生活必需品之自給自足，吾人不應似過去僅仰仗國外輸入，須圖减輕大東亞共榮圈之負擔。第二吾人須與東亞各國交換共存共榮所必要之物資，並與共榮圈內各國共謀經濟發展，獨立菲島尙有文化問題，此實為一最大困難問題，我國民性，由於過去四世紀美西兩國之統治，巳蒙甚大影響，一般知識階級　西洋文明之認識，實較東洋文明為深，彼等鮮洧深知東洋文明者，同時東洋文明之理解力亦極薄弱，於短期間內自不能改變吾人之精神，然若無與共榮圈內各國之文化溝通及精神上之連繫關係，則菲島與此等各國間一切必要之　　工作，其基礎必不能穩固。同時，不免遭他人之非難，吾等菲人於政治方面，基於適合吾國固有　　之政治形態，於經濟方面，則以自給自足為原則，謀東亞各國相互之發展，於文化方面，復興眞正之菲島文化，與吾盟邦國各　　更緊密之精神連繫，為復活國家主義思想，吾人刻正努力恢復我國國語，固有制度及　族。同　並謀我等本身之向上，以獲得我民族之光榮，我等菲律賓人與盟邦各國，實有血之連繫關係。</p>
<p>準備委會宣告解散</p>
<p>馬尼剌十三日中央社電　菲島獨立準備委員會，十二日下午於委員長洛勒爾司令下，假馬尼剌飯店舉行獨立準備委員會最後之會議，席間討議六分科委員會中調査計劃委員會之報告後，即討論　委員會報告書之內容。如菲島獨立後，於經濟　各方面之恒久計劃，結果全體一致通過。繼由洛勒爾委員長致獨立準備委員會解散辭，遂散會，按該獨立準備委員會自本年六月成立以來，已歷四月之久，於茲已　成光輝之使命，遂告解散。</p>

<h3>邱吉爾宣布　英葡成立協定　亞索爾島供英使用</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十三日中央社電　據倫敦消息：邱吉爾首相，昨日在下議院宣稱：葡萄牙巳依照英國之　求，宣布允許英美在　素爾Azoros羣島有某種便利，以保護反軸心在大西洋上之商業航務。此項協定係　時性質，戰事結束後，英軍即將　　撤離亞素爾。英國並將以軍事上及其他必需之供應品，供給亞索爾之葡人。此項新協定，並不影響於葡萄牙之希望維持其在歐洲中立之　策，並為伊比利安半島之和平地區。此項協定係淵源於一三七三年英皇愛　華三世與葡王福迭南及葡　愛　　所簽訂之條約，此次英葡談判結束後，英外相艾登致　葡總理，力　葡政府所給與　　之便利，實大有助於英國之有效的保衛其航務。葡總理亦覆電稱：渠亦希望所給與英國之便利，將有助於使大西洋航運更臻安全。</p>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　亞索爾羣島，包括有九　島嶼，依照英葡新協定而交由英國使用之特賽兪拉島，為九島中之第二大島，葡國最大之軍用機塲即設於該島。總督府設在該島最大之安格拉鎭，該鎭海港有　　重大貨物之　備，該島西北面防禦設　　强，亞索爾羣島距葡　本　七百公里，其居　幾全為葡人。</p>
<p>葡政府發聲明中立政策不變</p>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　關於葡萄牙政府在亞索爾羣島給與英國某種便利事，葡政府已於星期二下午發表公告，力言　葡政府每過需要闡明其外交政策時，曾迭次表明其誠意，希望維持中立，但常聲明此項中立係有條件的性質，葡國之中立常以英葡同盟為依歸。　葡萄牙政府自開始即遵守其與西班牙所訂不侵公約及補充約定之義務，並探悉葡國此項政策，獲得英國之同情，因英國之作戰政策，並不與在伊比利安半島設立和平地區相抵　。關於英葡關係之發展，葡政府曾詳細通如西班牙，英國駐西大使亦將代表英政府通知西班牙。　英國首相亦巳宣示此次　與，將加强英葡　舊日之盟好，證實其現睦之友誼，並保證將來之友誼更為密切云。亞　　羣島中之特　　　已交由英國使用，所有亞索爾各島之德國及其他軸心國領事館將一律停閉，軸心國民亦須一律離境，葡外交部不久即將發表此項宣告。據云葡萄牙中立之政策並無改變，其與西班牙之集體政策亦無變動，　日前葡總理　拉柴博士與西外長喬丹納在西境會　時，巳將此事通知西班牙。</p>
<p>英葡談判情形隨時通知美國</p>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　據英京消息：倫敦政界昨日下午宣佈關於英葡間對於亞索爾羣島之談判，美國政府及其他反軸心政府常不斷獲得通知。據云美國政府對該協定完全同意。據悉此次主持談判者，英方為駐葡大使坎貝爾爵士，而以英外部中央司司長洛勃斯為之助，葡方則由總理薩拉柴親自主持談判。</p>
<p>瑪德里十三日中央社電　據倫敦消息：英葡　政府成立協定後，所得在亞索爾羣島享受之便利，其範圍現尙未經宣佈。但有資格之英國人士暗示謂，此項便利包括海港及航空塲之使用，並謂此項便利不僅英國可以享受，美國護航隊亦得享受之云</p>
<p>柏林保持緘默靜待事態發展</p>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　德外交部昨仍拒絕評論英葡關於亞索爾羣島之協定，而靜候葡萄牙方面之反響，將期於今日中午發表其詳請。一般人士對於此種新政治局勢之發　，僅由德通訉社以寥寥數語之消息獲知。蓋謂此原因實由於英國之　力，使葡政府被迫讓步而已，而邱吉爾首相　　　葡萄牙在該羣島之主權，並不因該協定之存在，遭受任何之影響。官方對此事件雖力持緘默，但有兩點應予注意者。　邱吉爾首相之　此事之宣布，並非使彼國出於徬徨無措。　無人相信此舉乃出於葡政府之自由意志者，而皆相信其協定之成功，完全由於英方之壓力。德外交部發言人史密特　士於昨日招待外國報界之會議席上，暗示柏林　預知英國之使　壓力對於葡國讓渡其根據地於反軸心國之謠傳及關於英軍佔領亞索爾羣島之談判，亦早已獲悉，而葡國　該羣島之無綫電突告中斷，及英方公司之裝置無綫電等事觀之，即知該島將有事變，不過對外猶守秘　而巳。英報對葡萄牙最近加緊其神經戰，即為英政府對葡首相薩拉柴加以壓力之證明，斷絕海外之供應，或為英國恐嚇手段之一種，此實屬葡國中心之一部犧牲，能否使葡國不捲入戰爭漩渦，仍成為問題而英國政策實欲使葡國加入戰團也。</p>
<h3>西班牙持鎭靜態度</h3>
<p>瑪德里十三日中央社電　此間對於葡萄牙在戰爭期內，將亞索爾羣島之軍事根據地移交與英國之消息，以鎭靜及保留之態度處之。此間政界宣稱，此事並不引起驚異，同時西元帥弗朗哥宜稱：英駐西人使霍爾曾向西政府正式保證，謂西葡不侵公約絕不因英葡協定而受威脅，故西班牙將繼續採取觀望　中立政策。</p>
<h3>法西斯政府組織新空軍　　羅馬十三日中央社電　此間對於葡萄牙在政府航空部劉部長博多日昨在此間向全國空軍人員廣播稱：渠巳奉墨索里尼統帥之命，組織一新空軍，俾能保持過去空軍之傳統榮譽，而與德空軍協力作戰。義境作戰德軍　實行分遣行動　耶爾希區戰事有發展　　柏林十三日中央社電　德國新聞社訉：星期一日亞平　山中之局部戰事，仍在繼續進行中。同時英軍在西部沿海區僅限於偵察行動，　　東部沿海則限於攪擾性之砲火。星期一之主要戰事，為美加軍在貝尼文托以西之卡勒爾（Calere）區與伏爾都拉拉以西之耶爾希（Jelsi）區繼續作突破之企圖。敵軍進攻部隊在若干處以一聯隊之强，追隨德軍之分遣行動，而德軍於實行分遣行動時，秩序井然，未受英美軍之任何干涉。耶爾希區戰事之發展，對於此點只有最顯明之例子，蓋反軸心軍二次猛攻，均在德軍防綫前被擊退，而蒙受重大之損失。另一敵軍聯隊在該區以東之羣山後，突遭德軍溜　砲與重臼砲之襲擊而大　，因此英美軍在該區無法作更進一步之攻擊，德軍為肅淸公路起見，發動猛烈之反攻，結果擒獲英美戰俘多名。　　山地平原戰事激烈　　卡勒爾區德軍後防隊在瓜提亞（Guar　　　之公路障碍處，抵抗美軍之進攻，經五日後，方在塞里托羣山中另立新陣地。美軍中南面與東南方面二度進攻，均為蒙脫瓜提亞山區之德軍重砲所擊退，德　甚至無動用擲彈兵之必要，卡姆巴尼亞平原上强大之英軍偵察隊，企圖試探在格拉柴尼斯（Grazzanise）越過伏爾托諾河之可能，但英軍尙未穿至南岸之前，即為德軍江防隊所　退。敵偵察隊共分三隊，其中一隊被殲滅，另一隊則遺棄其死者而急向後退。義前外長晤邱吉爾　　瑞與京城十三日中央社電　據海通社訊，「哥德堡商航新聞一英京特派　稱　前義外相斯福　於週末晤邱吉爾，日內即將赴阿爾及爾，渠不致加人巴特里奧政府，或將另組較巴政府更能代表義權益之政府。智利外長訪問墨西哥　　瑪德里十三日中央社電　據墨西哥京城消息：智利外長福南特，於星期一抵達墨京，渠將在墨逗留數日，東綫戰事　迫近戈美爾　蘇軍携冬季配備作戰　　柏林十三日中央社電　據海通社訉：東綫氣　甚　，由蘇方出動之生力軍所携冬　配備觀之。可見此等軍隊原係供冬季作戰時用者，但敵軍於星期一在各主要戰　以及極北與極南戰綫，仍無建樹可言，尼維爾區蘇軍擬廣泛突破合維　河中游之　國陣綫已歸失敗，敵知難而退，似巳變更目標，自突破點折向左右進擊，但亦無成效。德以大批坦克車反攻頗有所獲，尼維爾敵壓力未减，至於南路柴　魯基與梅立托波爾問敵攻勢似稍殺，蘇軍已無望間德軍陣綫仍屹然未動。此蘇方仍未放棄克復克里米亞之計劃。丁莫生柯或擬自寇許海峽進擊。或在半島某處登陸亦未可知。如蘇方確有此計劃，則諾　安之蘇軍勢須繼續進攻不巳。斯摩倫斯克明斯克公路與戈美爾間德軍　繼　按照計劃撤退，後衛時與敵軍發生激戰，今戰事巳逐漸接近戈美爾矣。聶伯河綫普利伯河口蘇軍之橋頭堡，　受北方及西北方德軍反攻之壓力，敵軍同時向基輔方面進軍，當發生激戰，至於河四岸較小之敵軍據點，仍在德軍箝制之中，克里曼　之橋頭堡亦迄　拓廣。　　各路德軍展開反攻　　柏林十三日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：德　彈兵藉新式重型猛攻砲之掩護，於星期一在亞索夫海與梅立托波爾之間進攻，並穿入蘇軍陣地，而向南方與東方，獲得不少領土之進攻。蘇軍由若干高陣地作艱苦之抵抗，但經數小時之激戰後，終於被擊退，蘇軍於是增調强大之坦克軍隊，以圖收複其高陣地，但其反攻終於在　　猛攻砲火之下宣告崩潰，敵坦克車十五輛不能行動。梅立托波　之北，蘇軍在强大之砲　，臼砲與排砲火掩護下，進攻數次，均被擊退，德軍陣綫中局部缺口一　，由側面加以包圍，敵軍不　蒙受　大之死傷，並在戰　上　棄坦克車十一　，步兵大砲十三尊，各　人小口徑之臼砲二十九尊，機關槍六十挺以上，及大批來福槍，敵軍遭此損失後，下午即不復向前進攻。蘇軍向柴普魯基猛攻被阻，損失重大，同時在中部　伯河區，敵屢次力圖護　其橋頭堡與岸頭堡，但結果均告失敗。就大體而言，中部聶伯河區之局勢，並無變化，但德軍在進攻中，已獲得若干進展。某　與普利伯河口之間。蘇軍以强大之步兵隊　攻，於是濕涇之森林間即展開激戰，結果德軍坦克車隊與　彈兵阻止蘇軍猛攻部隊之　進，最後並將其擊退至原陣地，德軍陣綫中暫時被突破之處，在十月十二日之　晚，德軍反攻中予以封合。戈美爾之南區，德擲彈兵擊退蘇軍强大部隊至索希河之對岸，敵損失戰俘　百名與大批戰具，　　最新式十五.二公分口徑之重砲五尊，此種猛攻砲上七公分厚之裝甲鐵板　　德軍之平射砲彈　　穿，蘇軍企圖扺　河之東岸　中　　斃者甚衆。　　東綫大雨泥濘載道　　瑞曲京城　　三日中央社電　路透社自莫斯科方　通訊謂：蘇聯秋季之大雨現巳開始，許多地區已變成泥濘滿途，蘇軍阻塞於公路上，保持運輸巳感困　。伊朗英駐軍　一部份撤退　依據三國公　　安加拉十三日中央社電　據德黑消息：伊之英國軍不久將撤退一部份，此次撤退導照英伊蘇三國所訂之公約而實行。該約規定如伊朗與一外國作戰，則防守之任務，將全由伊軍任之，現時伊朗業巳對德宣戰且伊軍改之後，巳可任此項任務，但此伊朗人士則認為英軍之撤退，乃表示英國之願在近東對蘇屈服，據云，在伊朗南部之產油區內，英方因有特殊利益需要保護，故不在撤退之列歐戰與巴爾幹諸國（五）　　土耳其的中立政策可说是宿命的。土耳其一向在德苏美英之微妙的均勢上巧妙地自處了。但如其發生流血的戰事，　這均勢亦不能不告崩潰。　　從這意義上，最近土耳其第一流的評論家耶　氏的論文，頗堪注目。他說：「土耳其的負資者及與論，以前常聲明土耳其如不受外來的攻擊，不　參戰。但不　忘却土耳其和英國有着同盟關係，且這並不是祇有在土耳其受外來攻　的塲合，英國始援助土耳其的片面的同盟關係。所以土耳其可以立在英國方面　戰，在這塲合，土耳其受外來的攻擊並不是絕對必要的條件。」　　　英派的耶　　　在說這種話，眞是可笑的話。一般人都以為這同盟條約是片面的。英國受德國和日本的攻擊，土耳其不是始終默然袖手而觀嗎？那麽，土耳其現在想改變態度，而忠實於和英國的同盟關係嗎，斷不是的。　　維持中立的希望不變　　一九四一年三月，蘇土共同宣言親善，同年三月締結匈土通商條約，六月，締結德土友好條約，八月，英蘇土三國共同宜言，九月，英土通商條約成立，十月，羅土通商條約，德土通商條約成立，十二月，有美國的對土武器租借法，四二年三月，保土通商條約成立，五月，延長義土通商條約，六月，締結德土武器借款協定，九月，締結亞土收買小麥協定，十月，締結美土榖物協定，十二月，締結義　通商協定。至本年二月，有羅馬的物物交換協定，匈土新通商淸算協定等。不問軸心反軸心，外交關係均同樣密切。今春加薩勃朗加會談的途次，邱吉爾會訪問土國，即傳說英土接近，但不久即有軍事使節的訪問柏林。可見土耳其面面俱到的應付手腕，無非想在軸心反軸心的均勢之上，維持本國的中立與安定。■　　前次大戰曾嘗過捲入戰爭的苦况。土耳其很明白，縱使英美方面勝利，土耳其也將毫無所得、巴爾幹半島在蘇聯的勢力範圍之下，要想獲得一點土地，那是不可能的，甚至於土耳其最關心的「海峽」.亦有被奪之虞。靠着阿泰沮爾島的　業而　成近代國家的土耳其，如其在戰塲的廢墟中並無所得。決計不會參戰。　　可是義大利的投降却是使土耳其驚愕的事態。即因義國的退出，使土耳其感到這均勢有崩潰的危險。土耳其急速地想接近美國的事實，即在想使美國牽制蘇聯對土耳共的壓力。據最近的情報，土耳其政府從美國接受運輸船的移　、靠着美國建造軍艦。　　土耳其最大的恐怖　　因飛機的發達，接連歐亞的韃靵尼爾海峽的價値，相當改　了，但土耳其所最　念的，依然是蘇聯為了制　「海峽」而从事武力干涉。英國曾请求使用土耳其的港灣用作修理船舶，美國用武器租借法示恩於土，而想租借航空基地，但均遭土政府的拒绝。這都是為了戰爭的目的。從戰的以至於戰後，以「海峽」問題為中心而壓迫土國，乃蘇聯的國策。所以今春德軍從高加索撤退土耳其即懼紅軍　下而在國境嚴事戒備，蘇土國境的戒備，至少有土國陸軍精銳六十個師的大半。土耳其現正拼命整頓軍備，從德國，從英美續訂武器借款協定，英美的對土供給武器，巳引起蘇聯的不滿，而請求限制，結果，聽說最近業已自制。　　總之，在德國方面，當進兵巴爾幹而把諸國收入勢力範圍時，知道强欲把土耳其拉入情抱並不是上策，使土耳其維持中立，乃駐土德大使巴本的任務，蘇聯除用自己的壓力破壊勢力均衡之外，關於土耳其情勢的變化，不喜任何別的要素揷入，乃是一種純粹的利己政策。　　最近英國的報紙對土耳其的維持中立政策加以相當激烈的攻擊，强迫實施同盟條約。當然，這可視為想使土耳其參戰的英國一流的神經戰，政府當局對此見解在英國軍部未必表示　同。卽軍事當局以為從防衛大英帝國的見地上，為準備將來的對蘇戰事，　把土耳其放在第一綫。事的眞僞姑置不論，但如參照蘇聯所要求的第二戰綫指定在四　時，可知蘇聯決不歡迎在英美在巴爾幹的進出。以土耳其為中心的蘇聯和英美的拉　工　　土耳其之鍵　　如此看來，土耳其參戰這問題，並不是前述耶琴氏的論調或軸心軍的情勢所能簡單地決定的。此次以義大利的投降為中心的地中海情勢，卽蘇聯在地中海的進出，在土耳其不啻是晴天霹靂。　　英美利蘇聯的妥協究竟到何程度，土耳其的中立在這三國的討論中占何地位，不出於推測的範圍，僅從土耳其的中立政策說來，最恐懼的乃是蘇聯乘英美的巴爾幹攻勢而在巴爾幹揷足。　　不用說，英美的對蘇妥協，亦自有其限度　　縱使因英美的讓步而巴爾幹登陸戰暫獲成功，但那裏有着德軍的反攻，更在蘇聯和英美之間，橫着在作戰的一致之上的根本問題。　　在伊朗，伊拉克，英美和蘇聯雖少接觸，亦常引起問題。因而在土耳其，在巴爾幹，在地中海、蘇聯和英國，或和美國，如其觸　互相碰着時，問題將擴大起亞吧！（全文完）（翔：譯自同盟世界週報一二二六號）</h3>

        <h1>1943.10.14</h1>
<h3>Congratulating the Independence of the Philippines</h3>
<p>"Where there is a will, there is a way." The Filipinos, who have continuously struggled for freedom and independence for over two hundred years, have finally fulfilled their long-cherished wish. Today is the day of the founding of the Republic of the Philippines. From now on, the Philippines will be a strong member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Their future is full of brightness.</p>
<p>The Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee has already completed the historical task of establishing the foundation of the nation and has formulated a constitution. The first President, Mr. Laurel, will be inaugurated today. For three hundred years, countless patriotic Filipinos have shed precious blood for the great ideal of independence. Now that it has been realized, the eighteen million people of the Philippine Islands are sincerely delighted and how excited they are!</p>
<p>The United States had also formally promised the Philippines its independence. According to the Tydings–McDuffie Act, it was to be granted independence on July 4, 1946. Initially, the United States wanted to annex the Philippines into its territory, although there were strong opponents within the country at the time. However, the American business community, enthusiastic about developing the East Asian market, supported the annexation of the Philippines as a stepping stone for aggression in Asia. The strong opponents of this gold-dollar imperialism were farmers and laborers. They said, "The annexation of the Philippines is nothing but a burden on the United States." Sure enough, the subsequent development of the situation proved that the views of the farmers and laborers were correct. Because the management of the Philippines required extremely high sacrifices, the United States had to pay a considerable price to maintain the finances of the Philippine Islands, importing millions of tons of sugar from the Philippines every year. In addition, the United States also needed to import copra, hemp, and other materials at particularly high prices every year.</p>
<p>Because of the import of such a large quantity of materials, it was not for necessity. On the producer side in the United States, especially many sugar producers who had invested in Java and Cuba, suffered great sacrifices. Therefore, sugar investors and general farmers expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the management of the Philippines. In addition, hundreds of thousands of Filipinos migrated to the Pacific coast of the United States every year, and the cost of employing them was lower, so they were also opposed by the American labor community. However, when the U.S. authorities maintained the Philippines as its territory, it was impossible to prevent the immigration of Filipinos in terms of the situation, so the labor community even expressed disagreement with maintaining the Philippines.</p>
<p>The fact that American farmers and laborers regarded the Philippines as a burden and began to advocate abandonment was originally an excellent opportunity for the Filipino people to gradually nurture the independence movement. Therefore, the Democratic government, which had always supported the interests of farmers and laborers, gave the Philippines a long-term check for independence.</p>
<p>However, what exactly does the independence promised by the United States entail? The United States ruled the Philippines for more than twenty years, and tried its best to numb the Filipinos, creating a completely parasitic personality. Making them eat American food, wear American-made clothes, drive American-made cars, speak American language, and do American-style entertainment, assimilating Filipinos in various environments. As a result, Filipinos gradually turned to Americanism, making them 100% dependent on American products. If the United States does not import them for a day, they cannot live for a day. This situation is what the American business community wants. Therefore, once the aforementioned foundation of complete dependence of the Philippine Islanders on American goods is created, the American business community believes that whether the Philippine Islands are politically dependent on the United States is not a problem. Therefore, the American business community did not strongly oppose the independence bill.</p>
<p>From the above observations, we dare to say that the focus of the Philippine issue lies on the Filipino people themselves. That is, how can they prepare for their independence economically and financially and break away from the scope of dependence on the United States.</p>
<p>According to the independence bill decided by the United States, it is stipulated that all financial assistance will be completely stopped from the day of the independence of the Philippines, such as the import of sugar and copra. In addition, a ban on Philippine immigration has been formulated. In addition to being deprived of all benefits, Filipinos are also forced to accept several conditions. For example, it is stipulated that the political form of the Philippines must be an American-style false democratic republic, that American language must be used in public schools, and even that naval bases must be reserved.</p>
<p>What the United States is trying to do is to make the Philippines a prototype of a small America. The Americans are very clear about the fact that Filipinos are an Oriental nation with an Asian environment. So why do Americans force the chemical American political organization and way of life on this different nation in a different environment? If Americans really give Filipinos happiness and prosperity, why don't they allow Filipinos to have a political form and way of life that are most suitable for their traditions and environment? In fact, the United States has never allowed the possibility of independent freedom. Americans cannot abandon the indirect control of the Philippines, and at the same time cannot abandon the desire to make the Philippines a market exclusively for American products. In the American plan, the independence of the Philippines contains elements of hypocrisy. This should be pointed out.</p>
<p>Now the Filipinos are no longer groaning under the oppression of tyrannical and hypocritical Americanism, but have gained true freedom and independence. Under the situation of the new order in Greater East Asia, as a member of Greater East Asia, they have accepted the opportunity for unlimited development and prosperity in the future. We cannot help but express our congratulations to the Filipino people, and at the same time express our congratulations to the future of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>Although the number of Chinese residing in the Philippines is not very large, they occupy a fairly important position in the economic community. Here, as the Philippines completes its independence and the whole country is renewed; at the same time, as the countries of Greater East Asia cooperate to strive for victory and complete the new order, we hope that the overseas Chinese in the Philippines will continue their past efforts and assist the local government in jointly promoting the prosperity and prosperity of the Republic of the Philippines.</p>

<h3>Chairman Wang's Remarks</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Philippines is scheduled to declare its independence today (the 14th). Chairman Wang of the National Government has issued the following statement: The glorious independence that the eighteen million people of the Philippines have been looking forward to has been realized today. We, standing on the position of East Asian comrades, express our infinite congratulations. Britain and the United States have carried out aggression in our East Asia for a long time. Many East Asian nations and their countries have been enslaved and shackled by Britain, which is known to all. The Philippines was also sacrificed under the control of the United States. Although the Philippine nation has risen up against the United States from time to time, it has failed to achieve its goal due to the strong oppression of the United States. The meaning of the Greater East Asia War lies in defeating Britain and the United States and liberating East Asia. Due to the heroic achievements of the soldiers of the friendly Japanese nation, the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States have been driven out of the Greater East Asia region. The nations of Greater East Asia, which were previously oppressed and exploited by Britain and the United States, have achieved the opportunity for revival. The establishment of the Republic of the Philippines has also achieved success through this opportunity for revival. While celebrating the completion of the Philippine Republican Government, we also express our respect to the brave soldiers of the friendly Japanese nation. We also hope that all the vassal states and compatriots of East Asia will unite sincerely, uphold the concept of common prosperity and strive hard to achieve the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Vargas' Statement</h3>
<p>Manila, 13th (Central News Agency) - Vargas, the chief of the Philippine executive branch, issued a long statement through the same news agency on the 12th, as the Declaration of Independence is about to be issued. The gist of the statement is as follows: The allied Japanese Empire has granted the Philippines the freedom to initiate and establish administrative institutions. Today, the primary political issue in the Philippines is the perfection of domestic administration. Other basic and important issues are national defense. I dare say that all Filipinos hope for the independence of their motherland and the stability of the government. We Filipinos cooperate with the nations of East Asia based on the principle of protecting national security. Today, no country in East Asia other than the Japanese Empire can resist foreign enemies and defend the motherland. However, if the countries of East Asia practice great unity under the guidance of Japan, there is no need to fear foreign invasion and defeat. The political significance of the Philippines becoming a link in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and realizing independence lies in this. The economic significance of Philippine independence has been carefully reviewed and there is no need to repeat it. Only by joining the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and implementing economic cooperation with the countries of East Asia can the Philippine economy achieve its own prosperity. First, independent Philippines must strive for self-sufficiency in daily necessities such as food and clothing. We should not rely solely on foreign imports as in the past, but should try to reduce the burden on the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Second, we must exchange materials necessary for co-existence and co-prosperity with the countries of East Asia, and jointly seek economic development with the countries in the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Independent Philippines also has cultural issues, which is indeed a major challenge. Due to the rule of the United States and Spain for the past four centuries, our national character has been greatly influenced. The general intellectuals have a deeper understanding of Western civilization than of Eastern civilization. They rarely have a deep knowledge of Eastern civilization, and their understanding of Eastern civilization is also very weak. Our spirit cannot be changed in a short period of time, but if there is no cultural communication and spiritual connection with the countries in the Co-Prosperity Sphere, the foundation of all necessary work between the Philippines and these countries will not be stable. At the same time, it cannot avoid being criticized by others. We Filipinos base ourselves on a political form suitable for our country's inherent conditions in the political sphere. In the economic sphere, we take self-sufficiency as the principle and seek mutual development with the countries of East Asia. In the cultural sphere, we revive the true Philippine culture and establish a closer spiritual connection with our allied nations. We are currently working hard to restore our national language, inherent system, and ethnicity in order to revive nationalistic ideas. At the same time, we are striving to improve ourselves in order to obtain the glory of our nation. We Filipinos have a blood connection with the allied nations.</p>

<p>Philippine Chinese Clarify Their Determination</p>
<p>Manila, 13th (Central News Agency) - On the eve of the Philippines' declaration of independence, Wu Guanlai, President of the Philippine Chinese Association, represented the 130,000 Chinese in the Philippines, clarifying their wishes and determination as follows: We overseas Chinese in the Philippines are truly delighted with the birth of the Republic of the Philippines.

Centuries ago, our ancestors began friendly relations with the people of the Philippines, and since then, they have sought mutual goodwill with their sincere friendship. We will do our best to assist in the construction of the Philippines and achieve the Greater East Asia War.</p>

<h3>Burmese Ambassador to Japan Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - Thai Maung, the Burmese Special Envoy, met with a group of reporters at the Greater East Asia Guest House at 10:30 a.m. on the 13th and issued a statement, the gist of which is as follows: Burma has recently gained independence, and the special and sacred mission I bear is extremely important. Since 1911, I have been the first to advocate Pan-Asian Unionism, hoping to realize the ideals of my youth. I am extremely honored to be able to observe the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. All the people of Burma believe that establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is the only effective way to bring peace to East Asia, and they all hope that the Japanese army will achieve final victory. I believe that in order to achieve the sacred mission I bear, close personal contact is also necessary in addition to diplomatic contact between the two countries. Burma aims to become an important and powerful member of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and will make the youth take on heavy responsibilities in this war. Buddhist teachings say that it is better to be enslaved and gain eternal life. The Burmese people deeply understand this meaning, so they must gain independence in thought, action, and speech. The Burmese people know that defeat will be a fatal blow to the Burmese nation, so with the support of the guiding country Japan and our comrades-in-arms, we should overcome the ups and downs of the war situation and endure everything with courage. The Burmese people have become familiar with how to adapt to this environment due to the war in the past year. I dare say that they will give full cooperation until Japan achieves final victory.</p>
<h3>Japan Strives to Increase Production of Important Materials</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to recent surveys, important materials such as steel, coal, minerals, and machine tools in Japan in the first half of this year (April to September) have all exceeded the planned production targets, which proves the hard work and spirit of production personnel. It has been found that the production figures for the first half of the year in Japan in previous years have often shown a downward trend, but this is necessary especially during this period when the war situation is becoming increasingly pressing, even if it means increasing one ton of iron or one machine tool. Japan is currently overcoming all difficult production conditions and moving towards increased production. As a result, the production of various materials in the first half of the year at the end of September exceeded the planned targets and achieved beautiful results. However, given the needs of the current war situation, a leap in production is also needed in the second half of the year, so various industrial circles are making every effort to plan production countermeasures.</p>

German Troops in Italy Implement Detachment Actions Battles Developing in the Jelsi Area Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency: Local battles in the Apennine Mountains continued on Monday. At the same time, British forces in the western coastal area were limited to reconnaissance activities, while in the eastern coastal area, they were limited to disruptive artillery fire. The main battles on Monday were the continued attempts by American and Canadian forces to break through in the Calere area west of Benevento and the Jelsi area west of Volturara. In several places, enemy attacking units followed the German detachment actions with the strength of a regiment, and the German army maintained order and was not interfered with by the British and American forces during the implementation of the detachment actions. The development of the battle in the Jelsi area is the clearest example of this point, as two Axis counterattacks were repelled in front of the German defense line, suffering heavy losses. Another enemy regiment, behind the mountains east of the area, was suddenly attacked by German mortars and heavy mortars and suffered heavy losses, so the British and American forces were unable to make further attacks in the area. In order to clear the roads, the German army launched a fierce counterattack, resulting in the capture of many British and American prisoners of war. Fierce Battles in Mountainous and Plain Areas The German rear guard in the Calere area resisted the American advance at the road obstacles in Guartia, and after five days, established new positions in the Cerreto Mountains. Two American attacks from the south-central and southeast directions were repelled by the German heavy artillery in the Montaguardia mountain area, and the Germans did not even need to use grenadiers. Powerful British reconnaissance teams on the Campanian Plain attempted to probe the possibility of crossing the Volturno River at Grazzanise, but before the British troops crossed to the south bank, they were repelled by the German river defense force. The enemy reconnaissance team was divided into three teams, one of which was annihilated, and the other abandoned its dead and retreated in haste. Former Italian Foreign Minister Meets Churchill Zurich, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Haitong News Agency, "Göteborg Commercial Shipping News" reported from a special correspondent in London that former Italian Foreign Minister Sforza met with Churchill over the weekend and will soon go to Algiers.

Chilean Foreign Minister Visits Mexico Madrid, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Mexico City: Chilean Foreign Minister Funante arrived in Mexico City on Monday and will stay in Mexico for several days. Eastern Front Battles Approaching Gomel Soviet Troops Fight with Winter Equipment Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to Haitong News Agency: The weather on the Eastern Front is very cold, as can be seen from the winter equipment carried by the reinforcements dispatched by the Soviet side. It can be seen that these troops were originally intended for winter operations, but the enemy made no achievements on the main battlefields and the far north and far south fronts on Monday. The Soviet army in the Nevel area attempted to make a wide-ranging breakthrough in the German defense line in the middle reaches of the Velikaya River, but failed. The enemy retreated in the face of difficulties and seemed to have changed its target, attacking left and right from the breakthrough point, but to no avail. The German army's counterattack with a large number of tanks was quite successful, and the enemy pressure in the Nevel area has not decreased. As for the southern route, the Soviet offensive between Chaipruki and Melitopol seems to have weakened slightly, and the Soviet army has no hope of breaking through the German line, which remains unshaken. It seems that the Soviet side has not abandoned its plan to recover Crimea. Timoshenko may intend to attack from the Kerch Strait, or land somewhere on the peninsula. If the Soviet side does have this plan, then the Soviet army in Novorossiysk must continue its offensive without end. Between Smolensk-Minsk Highway and Gomel, the German army continues to withdraw according to plan, and fierce battles occur between the rearguard and the enemy army. Now the battle is gradually approaching Gomel. The Soviet bridgehead at the mouth of the Pripet River on the Dnieper River line is under pressure from German counterattacks from the north and northwest. At the same time, the enemy army is advancing towards Kiev, and fierce battles are taking place. As for the smaller enemy strongholds on the four banks of the river, they are still under German control, and the bridgehead in Kremenets has not been expanded. German Troops Launch Counterattacks Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency: Under the cover of new heavy assault guns, German grenadiers attacked on Monday between the Sea of Azov and Melitopol, penetrated the Soviet line, and made offensives to the south and east, gaining considerable territory. The Soviet army made arduous resistance from several high positions, but after several hours of fierce fighting, was finally repelled. The Soviet army then mobilized powerful tank units in an attempt to recapture its high positions, but its counterattack finally collapsed under the fire of the assault guns, and fifteen enemy tanks were unable to move. North of Melitopol, the Soviet army launched several attacks under the cover of powerful artillery, mortars, and platoon fire, but were all repelled. A local gap in the German line was surrounded from the flanks, and the enemy suffered heavy casualties and abandoned eleven tanks, thirteen infantry cannons, twenty-nine small-caliber mortars, more than sixty machine guns, and a large number of rifles on the battlefield. After this loss, the enemy did not attack further in the afternoon. The Soviet offensive towards Chaipruki was blocked, suffering heavy losses. At the same time, in the central Dnieper River area, the enemy repeatedly tried to protect its bridgeheads and beachheads, but all failed. In general, the situation in the central Dnieper River area has not changed, but the German army has made some progress in the offensive. Between a certain point and the mouth of the Pripet River, the Soviet army launched an attack with a powerful infantry unit, and fierce battles broke out in the wet forest. As a result, the German tank unit and grenadiers stopped the advance of the Soviet offensive unit, and finally repelled it to its original position. The point where the German line was temporarily broken through was sealed off during the counterattack on the evening of October 12. In the southern area of Gomel, German grenadiers repelled a powerful Soviet unit to the opposite bank of the Sozh River, and the enemy lost hundreds of prisoners of war and a large number of war materials, including five of the latest type of 15.2 cm heavy cannons. The 7 cm thick armor plate on this type of assault gun was penetrated by German direct-fire artillery shells, and many Soviet troops who attempted to resist on the east bank of the river were killed. Heavy Rain and Muddy Roads on the Eastern Front Zurich, 13th (Central News Agency) - Reuters reported from Moscow that the heavy autumn rains in the Soviet Union have begun, and many areas have become muddy, blocking the roads. It is difficult for the Soviet army to maintain transportation. British Troops in Iran Retreat in Part According to the Tripartite Agreement Ankara, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Tehran: British troops in Iran will soon withdraw in part. This withdrawal is being carried out in accordance with the agreement signed by Britain, Iran, and the Soviet Union. The agreement stipulates that if Iran is at war with a foreign country, the task of defense will be entirely the responsibility of the Iranian army. Now Iran has declared war on Germany and the Iranian army has been reorganized and is able to assume this task. However, Iranian sources believe that the withdrawal of British troops indicates Britain's willingness to yield to the Soviet Union in the Near East. It is said that in the oil-producing area of southern Iran, the British side has special interests that need to be protected, so it is not included in the withdrawal. European War and the Balkan Countries (5) Turkey's policy of neutrality can be said to be a matter of fate. Turkey has always cleverly positioned itself in the delicate balance of power between Germany, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain. However, if bloody warfare occurs, this balance of power will inevitably collapse. In this sense, the recent essay by Mr. Y, a first-class commentator in Turkey, is quite noteworthy. He said: "Turkish investors and public opinion have often stated that Turkey will not participate in the war unless it is attacked from the outside. But we must not forget that Turkey and Britain have an alliance, and this is not a one-sided alliance relationship where Britain only assists Turkey when Turkey is attacked from the outside. Therefore, Turkey can stand on the side of Britain in the war, and in this case, it is not an absolutely necessary condition for Turkey to be attacked from the outside." It is truly laughable for Mr. Y, a pro-British figure, to say such things. It is generally believed that this alliance treaty is one-sided. Has Turkey not remained silent and stood by while Britain was attacked by Germany and Japan? So, does Turkey now want to change its attitude and be loyal to its alliance with Britain? Absolutely not. The Hope of Maintaining Neutrality Remains Unchanged In March 1941, the Soviet Union and Turkey jointly declared friendship. In the same month, a Hungarian-Turkish trade treaty was concluded. In June, a German-Turkish friendship treaty was concluded. In August, Britain, the Soviet Union, and Turkey jointly declared. In September, a British-Turkish trade treaty was established. In October, a Romanian-Turkish trade treaty and a German-Turkish trade treaty were established. In December, the United States had the Lend-Lease Act for Turkey. In March 1942, a Bulgarian-Turkish trade treaty was established. In May, the Italian-Turkish trade treaty was extended. In June, a German-Turkish weapons loan agreement was concluded. In September, an Azerbaijan-Turkish wheat purchase agreement was concluded. In October, a US-Turkish grain agreement was concluded. In December, an Italian-Turkish trade agreement was concluded. Until February of this year, there were barter agreements in Rome, new Hungarian-Turkish trade liquidation agreements, etc. Regardless of the Axis or anti-Axis powers, diplomatic relations are equally close. This spring, on the way to the Casablanca Conference, Churchill visited Turkey, and there were rumors of closer ties between Britain and Turkey, but soon there was a visit to Berlin by military envoys. It can be seen that Turkey's all-round handling is nothing more than wanting to maintain its own neutrality and stability on top of the balance of power between the Axis and anti-Axis powers. Having experienced the suffering of being involved in the war in the previous world war, Turkey understands very well that even if the British and American side wins, Turkey will gain nothing. The Balkan Peninsula is under the sphere of influence of the Soviet Union, and it is impossible to obtain a piece of land. Even the "straits," which Turkey is most concerned about, are in danger of being taken away. Turkey, which has become a modern country by relying on the oil industry on Aderse Island, will never participate in the war if it gains nothing in the ruins of the battlefield. However, the surrender of Italy was a shocking event for Turkey. Italy's withdrawal made Turkey feel that the balance of power was in danger of collapsing. The fact that Turkey is rapidly trying to get closer to the United States is to make the United States restrain the Soviet Union's pressure on Turkey. According to recent information, the Turkish government is receiving the transfer of transport ships from the United States and building warships with the help of the United States. Turkey's Greatest Fear Due to the development of aircraft, the value of the Dardanelles Strait, which connects Europe and Asia, has been considerably changed, but what Turkey is most concerned about is still the Soviet Union's use of force to control the "straits." Britain requested the use of Turkish ports for ship repairs, and the United States used the Lend-Lease Act to show favor and wanted to lease air bases, but both were rejected by the Turkish government. These are all for the purpose of war. From the war to the post-war period, the Soviet Union's national policy is to pressure Turkey with the "straits" issue as the center. Therefore, when the German army withdrew from the Caucasus this spring, Turkey feared that the Red Army would come down and made strict preparations on the border. The preparations on the Soviet-Turkish border are made by at least more than half of the Turkish army's elite sixty divisions. Turkey is now desperately rectifying its military equipment, and continues to order weapons loan agreements from Germany, Britain, and the United States. Britain and the United States' supply of weapons to Turkey has aroused the dissatisfaction of the Soviet Union, and it has requested restrictions. As a result, it is said that it has recently been self-restrained. In short, on the German side, when advancing into the Balkans and bringing the countries into its sphere of influence, it knows that forcibly pulling Turkey into its embrace is not the best policy. Maintaining Turkey's neutrality is the task of the German ambassador to Turkey, Mr. Papen. The Soviet Union, in addition to using its own pressure to destroy the balance of power, does not like any other factors to be inserted into the changing situation in Turkey. It is a purely selfish policy. Recently, British newspapers have launched quite fierce attacks on Turkey's policy of maintaining neutrality, forcing the implementation of the alliance treaty. Of course, this can be seen as a first-class psychological warfare by Britain, which wants to get Turkey to participate in the war. The government authorities may not express the same views on this in the British military. That is, the military authorities believe that from the perspective of defending the British Empire, in preparation for future wars against the Soviet Union, Turkey should be placed on the front line. Regardless of the truth of the matter, if we refer to the fact that the Soviet Union requested that the second front be designated in France, we can know that the Soviet Union does not welcome the British and American advance in the Balkans. The Soviet Union and the British and American pulling-work centered on Turkey The Key to Turkey In this way, the question of Turkey's participation in the war cannot be simply decided by the arguments of Mr. Yeqin or the situation of the Axis powers mentioned above. This time, the situation in the Mediterranean centered on Italy's surrender, that is, the Soviet Union's advance in the Mediterranean, is no less than a bolt from the blue for Turkey. To what extent will the compromise between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union reach, and what position will Turkey's neutrality occupy in the discussions of these three countries is beyond the scope of speculation. Judging only from Turkey's policy of neutrality, what it fears most is that the Soviet Union will take advantage of the British and American Balkan offensives to gain a foothold in the Balkans. Needless to say, the compromise between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union also has its limits. Even if the Balkan landings are temporarily successful due to the concessions of Britain and the United States, there is a German counterattack there, and there is a fundamental problem above the unity of operations between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States. In Iran and Iraq, although Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have little contact, problems often arise. Therefore, in Turkey, in the Balkans, and in the Mediterranean, if the Soviet Union and Britain, or the United States, encounter each other, the problem will expand, right?

Filipino Residents in Shanghai to Celebrate Philippine Independence Today Hold Celebrations and Tea Party (Central News Agency) The Philippine government declared independence to the world today (14th). This time, with the full support of the friendly country Japan, it was able to formally realize an independent country. Filipino residents in Shanghai heard the news and were all overjoyed. They decided to hold a grand celebration in Shanghai on the day of the declaration of independence, and at 8:00 am, all 500 Filipino residents in Shanghai gathered at Taiping Bridge and set off on a parade, led by a band playing the Philippine National Anthem for the celebration of independence. It is scheduled to hold a grand celebration ceremony at the racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road before 9:00 am. Officials from various countries in Shanghai have been invited to participate and attend. A grand celebration tea party will be held from 4:00 pm to 6:00 pm at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund of Nanjing Road to entertain representatives of friendly countries in Shanghai. There will be a warm and grand event at that time. Director Hirota Gives a Talk (Central News Agency) Director Hirota of the Information Section of the Japanese Embassy Office, who had been oppressed by the United States for 40 years, declared its independence to the world on the 14th. Hirota gave a talk yesterday (13th) to express his congratulations. "It is with boundless joy that the Philippines declares its independence today under the decisive battle. It is a pleasure for the people of the Allied country Japan and the one billion people of East Asia that the Philippine people can have a truly independent government. On the day of the declaration of independence of the Philippines, it is ridiculous that the United States published a recommendation to advance the date of Philippine independence in the Congress. In 1898, during the Spanish-American War, the United States gave the Philippines a nominal promise of independence. In fact, the United States established military bases on the island and tried to strengthen it, making it a base for aggression in East Asia. This kind of example can be seen clearly in China. According to the previous declaration of US Secretary of State John Hay, the principle of open door and equal opportunity was advocated for China, in order to equalize the rights and interests of Britain, France, and Russia. Small favors were given to the Chinese people in cultural undertakings to cover up its superficial policy of aggression and gradually lay the foundation for its aggression. Of course, the vanguard of China was the Philippines. Today, we are able to see China's autonomous independence and Burma's independence after driving out the evil power of the United States and the flames of liberation of the East Asian nations. The independence of the Philippines further strengthens the foundation of the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. We should take this opportunity to strengthen the determination of one billion people in East Asia to complete the war." Teachers' Subsidy Can Be Issued in Early Next Month Part-time Teachers Will Not Be Given Temporarily The education authorities, in consideration of the situation of teachers and staff in private primary and secondary schools, previously allocated a monthly subsidy of 100,000 yuan initiated by Mayor Chen. This matter has been going on for a month, and the education sector is very concerned. According to reporters from the Shanghai News Agency, there are already signs of progress in the issuance of subsidies, and it will be possible to issue them in early next month. Most private primary and secondary schools have already filled out the lists of teachers and staff in detail and submitted them to the authorities for review. If the lists have not been submitted so far, they will be considered as automatic waivers. It is also learned that the authorities stipulate that subsidies will not be issued to part-time teachers temporarily.

It is reported that the bureau is continuing to investigate and crack down. Charitable Garden Party Generous Sponsorship from All Walks of Life The Health Association Receives Celebrities Yesterday The charitable garden party initiated by the China Health Protection Association was held at the Kangle Hotel the day before yesterday to entertain people from all walks of life. More than 50 people, including Wen Lanting, Ding Fubao, Lin Kanghou, Pei Yunqing, Pan Gongbi, Zhang Wenquan, Zhan Zhaolin, Xiang Kangyuan, and Yang Fusheng, attended. Zhang Yipeng, Chen Bin, and Ma Ershi were elected as the main persons in charge. Lin Kanghou Talks About Eliminating the Sick People Lin Kanghou said in his speech on the same day: Today's society can be described as being plagued by poverty and disease. If we want to solve poverty, we must first solve disease. It is in the public's best interest to always maintain health, so a large-scale movement to eliminate the sick people is the biggest goal of our association. Spend a small amount of money to obtain the greatest effect of health protection. If we want to seek our own safety, we must try to eliminate the existence of all dangerous disease factors. I hope that the society will unite to eliminate the disease demon and save people and ourselves with one stroke. Yan Fuqing Discusses Early Diagnosis Dr. Yan Fuqing said in his speech: I suffered from stomach cancer in my early years. Fortunately, I had an early examination and diagnosis, and underwent surgery in the United States to remove almost two-thirds of my stomach. Fortunately, I recovered my health, so I am able to meet you all here today, thanks entirely to early diagnosis. The doctor also said that his friend Mr. Zhetang also suffered from the same disease and underwent surgery in Boston. At that time, the results were considered good, but unfortunately the surgery was too late and the patient died within six months. From this point of view, the early diagnosis of a disease is extremely important. Not only can individuals recover their health early and engage in production early, but also save on medical expenses and relieve the burden on the people. In recent years, the source of medicines has been cut off. To achieve the goal of saving, the only way is early diagnosis. In other words, everyone needs accurate early diagnosis. Early Diagnosis and Treatment to Save on Medical Expenses If a disease is discovered, early treatment can save on medical expenses and achieve the true goal of relieving poverty and disease. This kind of undertaking that benefits the country and the people is still in its budding stage in our country. All of you here are leaders in society and will definitely work hard to promote this preventive work that costs little and has great effects. The purpose of this garden party is not only to make you all feel physically and mentally happy, but also to make the general public have health protection. I am afraid that the society does not understand the truth, so I specially explained the benefits of early diagnosis that I have received, hoping that all circles will promote it together. The society is very fortunate, and the health cause is very fortunate. It is reported that the association's medical department is currently presided over by Dr. Xie Yingrui. Dr. Xie presided over the Health Bureau of the Public Works Department for 18 years and has devoted much effort to improving public health in this city. Now he is working hard on the health cause, which is really a fortunate thing for his career. The garden party initiated by the association is scheduled to be held on the 17th of this month at No. 1726 Zhaofei Road. The tickets are not for sale and are given to donors.

"Modern History of Japan" Translated by the Sino-Japanese Cultural Research Institute Published Today and Distributed by This Newspaper "Modern History of Japan," originally written by Mr. Omori Kin'gorou, is a famous Japanese historian. The narrative is detailed, the system is clear, and the most essential content is concentrated on the process of completing the Meiji Restoration. It has only been a few decades since Japan entered the ranks of powerful countries. Before the Meiji Restoration, the government came from the samurai, and the weakness of the national power was far greater than that of China at that time. After the Meiji Restoration, the situation changed completely, reforming domestic affairs, expanding power, and reaching today is a great miracle. If we are willing to review the reasons for our past failures from the success of others, this will definitely provide some historical lessons. At the same time, increasing our understanding of Japan is even more expected. In today's era of frequent Sino-Japanese cultural exchanges, this book introducing modern Japanese history is welcomed by people from all walks of life. The Sino-Japanese Cultural Research Institute was established to shoulder this mission, and Mr. Youyou generously donated all the funds for the establishment of the institute, in order to realize the work of Sino-Japanese cultural exchange as soon as possible. Therefore, the institute first selected the book "Modern History of Japan" and invited Mr. Wen Moguang to translate it. The translation is fluent and has been published today. It is distributed by this newspaper. The book has more than 300 pages, bound into a thick volume, priced at 30 yuan per volume, with postage added for outside areas. Ambassador Cai to Japan Talks About Stabilizing People's Livelihood After returning to the country for duty at the end of last month, Ambassador Cai Pei to Japan arrived in Shanghai at around 11:00 pm the night before and gave a speech as follows: "I have been abroad for almost five months. When I went abroad, the Shanghai concessions had not yet been recovered. Now I see that the Shanghai concessions have been recovered, our country's territory is complete, independence and autonomy have been achieved, and the goal of the national revolution has been achieved. Under this pleasure, I hope that the construction of a new China in the future must first stabilize the people's livelihood. How to stabilize the people's livelihood? The prerequisite must be to increase production. After increasing production, prices will be suppressed, and then the people's livelihood can be stabilized. I hope that our friendly country Japan can assist our country in increasing production. The reason is that increasing production requires solving capital, raw materials, labor, transportation, and other problems. Japan must cooperate in everything. I believe that Japan's thorough mobilization of the people under the wartime system is worthy of our country's reference. At present, the Japanese people are united and their morale is high. Many university students voluntarily serve in the military, and all Japanese women have united to serve the country. Human and material resources are fully mobilized, which has strengthened Japan's combat power. Although domestic materials are subject to strict control, because the distribution is equal, the people's livelihood is unusually stable. What is most admirable is that the price of rice has remained the same from beginning to end. It can be seen that the general public in Japan is determined and determined to fight the decisive battle. I sincerely hope that our country will quickly learn from this in order to achieve a successful war of resistance. The people should also unite and strive to revive China and defend East Asia. As the ambassador to Japan, I will do my best to promote Sino-Japanese friendship and make the people of China and Japan progress more and more in ideological harmony and cultural communication, and complete the epoch-making mission of the Greater East Asia with the determination to live and die together." Restricting the Business Hours of Cafes Limited to Midnight Since the city implemented thrift and thrift, the business hours of all dance halls, cafes, and taverns and hotels have been stipulated by the authorities and announced to the patrol. It is heard that recently, some cafes are nominally operating cafes, but secretly setting up dance floors. Their business hours start in the morning and continue until late at night. This situation not only consumes materials but also violates the national principle of thrift. The Shanghai branch of the New Life Movement Association has sent a letter to the municipal government requesting suppression. After reporting the situation, the municipal government ordered the first, second, and third police stations to comply. In the future, the business hours of each cafe must not exceed midnight in order to suppress extravagance and promote thrift. Physical Education Basketball Match Strong China and Mixed Teams Tie, Popular Shantou Team Wins The third game of the grand basketball match was held at the Paramount Ballroom at 4:00 pm yesterday.

In the second game, the women's popular team and Huizhong were tied at the beginning, and the three forwards of Huizhong failed to make contact. In the first half, the popular team led 9 to 6. In the second game, Huizhong gradually became unable to support itself, and finally lost to the popular team 9 to 16. The strong China mixed team appeared, and Du Bencheng of Strong China first broke through the barrier, and Kong Guangyi scored a shot to add icing on the cake.

<h3>Churchill Announces: Anglo-Portuguese Agreement Established; Azores Islands Provided for British Use</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 13th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to news from London: Prime Minister Churchill announced in the House of Commons yesterday that Portugal has, in accordance with Britain's request, announced the allowance of certain conveniences to Britain and the United States on the Azores Islands to protect anti-Axis commercial shipping in the Atlantic. This agreement is temporary in nature. After the war ends, British troops will withdraw from the Azores. Britain will also provide military and other necessary supplies to the Portuguese on the Azores. This new agreement does not affect Portugal's hope to maintain its policy of neutrality in Europe and the peace zone of the Iberian Peninsula. This agreement originates from the treaty signed by King Edward III of England with King Ferdinand and the Queen of Portugal in 1373. After the Anglo-Portuguese negotiations concluded, British Foreign Secretary Eden sent a message to the Portuguese Prime Minister, emphasizing that the conveniences provided by the Portuguese government greatly contribute to Britain's effective defense of its shipping. The Portuguese Prime Minister also replied by telegram, saying that he also hopes that the conveniences provided to Britain will help make Atlantic shipping even safer.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Azores Islands include nine islands. Terceira Island, which is handed over to Britain for use in accordance with the new Anglo-Portuguese agreement, is the second largest of the nine islands. Portugal's largest military airport is located on the island. The governor's office is located in Angra, the largest town on the island. The town's seaport is equipped for handling heavy goods. The northwest side of the island has strong defenses. The Azores Islands are 700 kilometers from mainland Portugal, and almost all of its residents are Portuguese.</p>
<p>Portuguese Government Issues Statement: Neutrality Policy Unchanged</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency telegram) - Regarding the Portuguese government's provision of certain conveniences to Britain on the Azores Islands, the Portuguese government issued a public announcement on Tuesday afternoon, emphasizing that whenever the Portuguese government needs to clarify its foreign policy, it has repeatedly expressed its sincerity in maintaining neutrality, but has always stated that this neutrality is conditional in nature, and that Portugal's neutrality always depends on the Anglo-Portuguese alliance. Since the beginning, the Portuguese government has adhered to its obligations under the non-aggression pact and supplementary agreements signed with Spain, and has learned that Portugal's policy has gained the sympathy of Britain, because Britain's war policy does not conflict with the establishment of a peaceful zone on the Iberian Peninsula. Regarding the development of Anglo-Portuguese relations, the Portuguese government has informed Spain in detail, and the British Ambassador to Spain will also notify Spain on behalf of the British government. The British Prime Minister has also declared that this cooperation will strengthen the old alliance between Britain and Portugal, confirm their current friendly relations, and guarantee that future friendship will be even closer. Terceira Island in the Azores Islands has been handed over to Britain for use. All consulates of Germany and other Axis countries on all the Azores Islands will be closed, and citizens of Axis countries must also leave the country. The Portuguese Ministry of Foreign Affairs will issue this announcement soon. It is said that Portugal's policy of neutrality has not changed, nor has its collective policy with Spain. A few days ago, Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar informed Spain of this matter when he met with Spanish Foreign Minister Jordana on the Spanish border.</p>
<p>Anglo-Portuguese Negotiations Kept US Informed Throughout</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to news from London: London political circles announced yesterday afternoon that the United States government and other anti-Axis governments were constantly kept informed about the Anglo-Portuguese negotiations on the Azores Islands. It is said that the US government fully agrees with the agreement. It is understood that the British side presiding over the negotiations was Sir Campbell, the British Ambassador to Portugal, assisted by Mr. Roberts, the head of the Central Department of the British Foreign Office, while the Portuguese side was personally presided over by Prime Minister Salazar.</p>
<p>Madrid, 13th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to news from London: After the Anglo-Portuguese governments established the agreement, the scope of the conveniences to be enjoyed on the Azores Islands has not yet been announced. However, qualified British sources hinted that these conveniences include the use of seaports and airfields, and that these conveniences can be enjoyed not only by Britain, but also by US escort convoys.</p>
<p>Berlin Remains Silent, Awaiting Developments</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency telegram) - The German Foreign Ministry yesterday still refused to comment on the Anglo-Portuguese agreement on the Azores Islands and awaited the reaction from the Portuguese side, expecting to release the details at noon today. The general public only learned about this new political situation from a few words of news from the German News Agency, which said that this was due to British pressure, which forced the Portuguese government to make concessions. Prime Minister Churchill allegedly stated that Portugal's sovereignty over the islands would not be affected in any way by the existence of the agreement. Although officials maintained silence on this matter, two points should be noted. The British Prime Minister's announcement of this matter was not to leave his country in a state of confusion. No one believes that this move was the free will of the Portuguese government, and all believe that the success of the agreement was entirely due to British pressure. Mr. Schmidt, the spokesperson of the German Foreign Ministry, hinted at a meeting with foreign reporters yesterday that Berlin had prior knowledge of rumors about British pressure on Portugal to cede its bases to the anti-Axis powers and about negotiations on the British military occupation of the Azores Islands. Judging from the sudden interruption of the radio on the Portuguese islands and the installation of radio equipment by British companies, it is known that there will be incidents on the islands, but secrecy is still maintained from the outside world. British newspapers' recent intensification of psychological warfare against Portugal is proof of the British government's pressure on Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar. Cutting off overseas supplies is one of Britain's intimidation tactics. It remains a question whether this sacrifice of a central part of Portugal can prevent Portugal from being drawn into the vortex of war, while British policy actually seeks to make Portugal join the war.</p>
<h3>Spain Maintains a Calm Attitude</h3>
<p>Madrid, 13th (Central News Agency telegram) - Here, the news that Portugal has transferred military bases on the Azores Islands to Britain during the war is being handled with a calm and reserved attitude. Political circles here claim that this matter does not cause surprise. At the same time, Spanish Marshal Franco stated that British Ambassador to Spain Hoare formally assured the Spanish government that the Spanish-Portuguese Non-Aggression Pact would not be threatened by the Anglo-Portuguese agreement, so Spain will continue to adopt a wait-and-see neutral policy.</p>
