<p>社評</p>
<h3>論留學制度　讀日本決定留日學生指導方針有感</h3>
<p>自從鴉片戰爭以後，國人震於泰西各國科學昌明，聲光化電的功能，認爲如能一一模倣舉得，必可臻國家於富强的境地。於是盛倡留學之議。可是，當時主持者昧於遠慮，亟於求進，對於派遣學生之年齡程度，學習科目之適合國內需要，以及派員監督指導等，均未有詳密計畫，通盤打算。因此，其初相率派遣幼童及未成年者出國，此輩在國內學習尙未成熟，意志亦未堅定，一入異邦，情景全異，一國原有一國的特殊環境，特殊國民性，以尙未成熟之稚年，自易爲環境潛化。回國之後，頗多趾高氣揚，目空一切，起居飮食，相率歐化，能讀原文之西書，而對本國極淺近之報章，反茫然不解。然而，當時對於留學回國者，頗有盲目觀念，以爲鍍金回來，才具已備，責付重任。其實，改造國家社會，究非易事，對於本國的風俗習尙，政制經濟，尙未有深切了解與研究，遽負重任，不僅徒勞無功，抑且重載而顚覆，此爲初期留學制度的失敗。</p>
<p>其後，雖能逐漸改善，數十年間，切學歸國者中，自不乏傑出之士，尤其於技術科學方面，較有成績。惟從整個留學政策以言，仍爲失敗的。</p>
<p>中國與日本同爲派遣學生赴西洋留學的國家，時間上彼此亦同，但日本得益於留學政策，實遠在中國之上。以學續而論，中國的留學生絕不在臼本的留學生之下。以回國後事業上的成績而論，則中國的留學生與日本的留學生相較，瞠乎其後了。老察其所以不同的原因，即在派遺留學生的方法有別。臼本派遣的留學生類多年歲稍長，且爲有「特殊心得與豐富經騐」的。中國派遺的留學生，前巳言之，類多幼童與青年，中國學生所得者，僅爲課堂中的書本知識，而日本學生所得者兼有社會上的事業經騐。因所得的不同，回國後所成就者遂亦各異。兩相比較，日本選送留學生的方法，遠勝於中國，殆爲明顯的事實。迨至近十年間，中國選送留學生方法，始有進步。例如從前淸華學校選送留學生都是十三四歲的幼童，在外國語言及普通知識上稍加準備，即派送赴美，在美所得者，畢業文憑與碩士博士頭銜而已。談到實際知識，則對中國社會與西洋社會，變方都無眞確認識與了解。其後，始規定大學畢業以後方能應試，考試及格後，須留國一年，先得做事經騐，方能出洋留學。此種留學生在國外所得，自必遠在從前淸華學生之上。因此，選派留學生方法的改進，頗與留學政策的成效有密切關係。</p>
<p>今天日本的國勢强盛，我們的國勢衰弱，雖然原因很多，可是，從留學政策的比較上，也是原因之一更可以看出强盛與衰弱幷不是偶然的事。現在我們的國家社會需要建設振興，其迫切程度，並不亞於鴉片戰爭以後的時期。我們對於留學政策，當然也有嚴切注意，適合改進的必要。</p>
<p>友邦日本的技衛科學以及經濟政法等學，經不斷的實騐硏究，不但比較我們先進得多，就是與世界各國較，也有其傑出的地位，足供我們的學習者正多，常此中日協力建設東亞之際，培養人才自爲當務之急。本報於七月十一日星期評論，曾發表章超君的「留學制度之檢討與商榷」一文，就留學制度擬貝大綱建議，於此不再贅述。今天特載「臼本決定留日學生指導方針」一文，（見本報第四版）友邦日本對於指華留學生的方計與辦法，我們非常贊同。並略申雜感如次：</p>
<p>以往中國的留日學生較諸其他各國，人數最多，歷史最久，地域最近，文字亦最爲接近。論理能通日文的人才也應最多。可是，目前的事實，最缺乏而共感痛苦的，却是日語通譯與日文翻譯人才。因此，中日之間，言語與文字尙且不能暢意通達，而侈言文化交流，自屬事倍功半了。</p>
<p>近二十年來，中國出版界對於英美書藉譯本頗多，而日本書藉譯者較少。此非日本無優秀著作，也非中國出版界對於日本著作有成見，完全由於精通日文人才的缺乏。</p>
<p>從中國留日學生的學科比較，雖無正確統計數字，但據一般推測，學習工農業等實科的太少，而軍趨於政法兩科，做官甚於做事的觀念，可於此測騐。</p>
<p>中國的留學生，各自對於留學國的情感比較好，這是事實，在這種事實下，必欲短期內一致瞭解以至傾向於日本政策的困難，也是事實。因此，爲期共同建設大東亞，非積極培養基幹人才不爲功。</p>
<p>我們很感激日本新定的指導留羿生方針。爲了十年二十年以後建設東亞的人才着想，今天更不能忽略嚴格訓練。因爲今元的人才缺乏，就是十年二十年以前的米注意嚴格訓練的後果。過去日木對於中國留學生管理太寬，以致今日精於日文日語的人才寥落，希望日本敎育當局的注意•同時，培植中日青年眞正相互了解的基礎，希望日本也派遣學生到中國來。這是我們的建議。</p>

<h3>來梄向中南美　發表廣播演說　促共為民族解放奮鬥</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　日前任駐美特使來栖三耶氏於十七日在東京中央放送局。向中南美廣播演說，其要旨如次：拉丁美洲人諸君，吾人今爲大東亞解放而奮鬥，乃爲遠在一百五十年之前，諸君祖先大約曾爲拉丁美洲解放而奮鬥。民族解放之潮流，今巳湧至東亞。大東亞十億民族以與南獎各國曾爲其獨立奮鬥之同樣精神，爲彼鱉之解放進行大東亞戰爭。英美亦曾爲彼　之解放與自由而奮鬥，然彼輩之愛自由的精神，乃與彼輩確立霸權同時成爲化石，英美今自稱爲世界之自由鬥士而加宣傳，然而祗就東洋而論，彼輩果曾予大東亞諸民族以自由乎。東亞共榮圈之理念，並非將大東亞脫離世界而超然獨立，乃使各在其她位協力世界。目前日本所採取之對華政策，即係根據此種理念。中國自最近收囘上海租界後，已成爲鴉片戰爭以來第一次自己家庭之主人爲，中國四億民心今皆翕然從事於解放運動。菲律賓，緬甸，在戰爭中破瓖者均經修復，政洽經濟之建設，亦在積極進行。緬甸已於八月一日完成獨立，菲律賓則於最近進行獨立，印度之反英空氣亦澎湃全印，凡此種種東亞民族奔騰澎湃之意志與努力，爲此等民族多年經積之渴望者，今皆賴日本之勝利而得遂願以償矣。美國今巳將全世界懸於美國金製十字架之下，拉丁美洲各國能追隨此種政策者，僅成爲美國之「馴服從僕，」而巳。諸君將再爲獨立而戰爭，抑將無條件投降於美國經濟的帝國主義之前乎。何去何從，目前君等選擇之時至矣。</p>
<h3>德國作戰不變　義北陣綫固若金湯</h3>
<p>三國同盟的叛徒：巴特利奥的倒戈，對於歐洲戰局，世界戰局，究竟右些什麽影響呢？對於在東部與强敵作戰之德國今後戰局的成算如何？頃有每日新聞柏林分社加藤社長於九日下午以國際長途常話與總社通話如次：</p>
<p>本社　德國對巴特利奧政權的投降，作何觀感？</p>
<p>加藤　關於這一點，今天德國外交部已有發表，德方認爲巴劃利奧的倒戈，是有計特的犯罪行爲，他的犯罪，是對於墨索里尼民領導的法西斯政府以及義國國民代表的飯逆，所以德國自從墨索里尼下野以後，就充分提防，未右絲亳動搖，德國國民聽到政府發表的公報，態度極其鎮　。</p>
<p>本社　日本也同樣的平靜，我以爲這是日德精神一致，大家確信必勝的結果。關於樹立在義國北部的新政府，願開　情形如何？</p>
<p>加藤　這點方才巳經有過發表，德國人民知道之後，異常沉着，而且又聽到墨索里尼氏毅然崛起協力完成對英美戰爭的廣播，心理更趨堅强，現在祇知道有新政府的樹立，至於其機構組織等等，都不明瞭，這個政府用什麼形式來協力擊減英美，以及政府骨幹的軍隊之機成等，也還沒有明瞭，所在地是靠近德義國境的義大利北部小都會</p>
<p>本社　在義大利之德軍的今後作戰？</p>
<p>加藤　我想今後敵人還會向義國各地登陸的吧！但是，德國軍隊擊減敵人的一　戰略，並無若何變更，按照既定方針進行作戰，或許會採取誘敵至北方而一舉予以殲減的戰法，右人以爲和南部義軍將發生小接觸，流種事情，或許現在已經發生亦未可知，不過，這種事情·對於作戰大局是沒有什麼影響的。</p>
<p>本社　東戰塲與巴爾幹方面的義軍如何？</p>
<p>加藤　目下在東戰塲的義軍，一直在後方，而且其數也不成問題。</p>
<p>本社　在義日僑的消息如何？</p>
<p>加藤　因爲柏林，羅馬你的聯絡中斷，所以一切情况不明，總之，我們要發揚三國同盟的精紳，日本與德國以及新近更生的法西斯新政府，三位一體，團結一致，抱必勝信念，努力擊減英美，這是最最要緊的事，德國一般人，都是如此想。（企青：譯自九月十一日每日新聞）</p>

　東洋英雄固有精神，本人對此深表贊仰．而與義之乞和比較，賀有天壞之別。原來東亞請民放，確立必勝擊減之精神，是以本人深信中日兩國之合作提携，在駢肩作戰時，無論任何强大敵人，可不足懼，是項信念，再按請事實，更益可加强。同時値茲甲午之役之今日，更特別希望淪政權人物，應體認此歷史上之事實，從　反省、並即老慮所就之施策。最後松島氏就海軍專家立塲觀務，對義艦隊之向英美乞和，絕無任何影響。蓄義之乞降於英美，　義總隊權造與英美艦隊相比毫無相同。　艦上所有之砲槍武器設備，絕無與英美雷同、即英美以軍火供給，在時間上難以顧及。　尤以訓練之差，兵員登艦　戰，更難發揮戰鬥力還，是以義海軍之乞降，我人　不予重視云云。　　再談航空　　松島氏　對此次航空紀念日將近，席問特發表日本空軍之優秀調練，闡述頗多，最後並述及渝美空軍在壓迫渝空軍，及茶　中團民衆等等。松島氏首以日水航空紀念日爲本月二十日，國　州及國外僑民均莫不展開熱烈紀念，日陸海航空部隊，注太平洋各地作戰之活躍，兵力優秀。出奇制勝，莫不獲奏　大勝利，予敵以重大之殲減打擊云云。氏又謂渠於昨日會會見航空頗市經騐官員，彼會參預夏威夷所雖門馬來等地作戰，經騐戰術，異常豐富，彼並謂在作戰區，兵員門魂之熱　，爲國効勞，無不確立必勝指念，是以我人更加强信念，且我海軍航空隊在任何作戰塲合，恒應付作戰，無論設巖及勝利如以擊敵奏效在十倍與數十倍之間，所奏宏大效果之原因，計　訓練具體化，　資材優良，原料充分準備，及駕駛員技術之熟練優秀，我人殊期待此優秀技士，今後在歷史上多添光榮之記錄。最後就渝空軍而述，今在渝空軍爲美在渝之第十四航空隊所壓迫，且英美在遠東之空軍更茶毒中國城鎭，殺害無辜人民，殊堪痛恨。此種事實，應爲渝軍所澈底認識，將過去之精神，應於建設東亞之大道邁進，以脫離前在外人桎桔下之奴隸生活，並積極防禦外敵之侵略，完成大東亞之任務　　廣田課長談話　英美幻想　　廣田氏首謂：就外交而言，當義巴政權叛國時，英美竟聲言欲解散日德義三國同盟，及動搖三國同盟之精神，更有計劃分裂日德關係之謬舉。然以事實而觀之，是項企圖，又成抱影，查義巴政權之氏氏妥協，普軸心同盟陣容，益發堅固增强。本月十五日。日德政副對該問題。均發表共同聲明。國明義雖爲此叛變行爲，我人仍報增三國盟約之義務，並爲達報三國同盟之目的、日德兩國不惜一切繼氏勢力，以達到最後勝利。繼以軍事而言，英美興義巴政權之休戰條約，英美要挾義方，以英美聯軍開赴義中部及南部，於上陸時如入無人之境，更且協助英美聯軍，導至義北，以壓迫德軍。但就其事實又得共反．’當英美聯軍上陸時，要無內應，義軍僅自動放棄武裝。　　德軍實力廣田氏又　：「並中南一帶，德駐軍實力龐大，英美駐軍頗難如願登陸，即以　勤諾之上陸，即　張大德軍所挫，麥甲下艦　逃，同時德軍在義境中南部，以發大軍力驅英美聯軍至義之南部，是項銳勢，不但在義一地，並在整個歐洲戰區，已確立歐洲之保壘此外英美原在羅馬時，擾扮佈巴特里史傀儡政府，並派紐約市長垃　地爲監督官。（拉本止於義國，今巳易籍美國。）惟是項企圖由於巴政權之失敗級，拉亦小能成行。再如義首揆黑案里尼於九月十三日經德救出後，英美方面，尤以美國，在　前對　指爲重大目標，以一打倒臺索里尼及法西斯帝黨，故以魔力宣傳巴政權乞和，即有以引渡墨氏至華盛頓之企國，由羅斯福與邱吉爾作聯合之政治　判，同時並動員國內之報紙、電影院戲院等一切宣傳機關，作擴大之吹噓，　龍成為事實。然英美此　毫無人道之卑劣手段、終為德希特勒元首以友誼之情，不惜由其警　隊　險設法在阿柏處齊峽谷被監禁處將　氏救出。故最近英雲所期待之政治總攻，亦告失敗。英美在七月廿五日義巴新政權之成立後之軍事政治外交總攻、巳成爲悲慘失敗之結果、更暴露英美威信之消失、然反觀日德陣容之確立、川益加強堅固。評言修正戰時刑事特別法　　友邦日本田尻愛戰公使會經引用過上海財界人士的一句話：「上海經濟界的惡弊，着不用張權來驅除，是無可救藥的。」前日最高國防會講通過了　正戰時刑事特別法，也正是這個　思。原來，戰時刑事特別法第十七條，就是爲着針對「經洽界的惡弊」而設的；經過此次修正以後，則不但對軍需品或生活必需品投機操縱或囤　居奇爲有罪，即以暴利爲自的買賣物品或操縱市價。擾亂市塲亦爲有罪，而其局法則爲「處死刑或無期徒刑，得併科十萬完以下罰金」。自法令言，眞可謂合於『治亂國，用重典』的一個原則了。　　「以　刑為目的」是戰時經濟界最強烈的一種毒素，因以流毒所及、物價狂漲，民不聊生；相反的，如果以增加正當止產爲途徑，癱持合理利潤爲滿足，則物價自趨平穩，民生自趨安定。因此，在戰時的日本，金業所得的逐漸减退是其戰時經濟中一種普遍的傾向。本年入月東京出版之「東洋經濟舉者」會把日本二二三家經營四十種不同工業的主要公司，在一九四二年第二季營業所得的减退程度，作一　括的考察，而歸納其原因於以下各話：　製造品價格受嚴厲的限制，　工貿高漲。支出劇增，　勞動福利事業費用的增加，　新建築及擴充養用的　貴，　捐稅的增加，　折萬準備的增加。所堪注意的，就是工資與勞動福利事業費用的增加，巳經佔了六個原因中的兩個。　　因此，可見舉暴利目的相反者，方是爲大衆，消費公衆與勞動階級—謀普邇的利益。所以，斯密亞丹早就認爲『治化進步之國，財當增而疏益减，然工資常藉而上升，故工資之變化，適與　益相反。」修正戰時刑法後　投機交易歛跡　囤貨抑價脫售市況安定　　國府當局爲實佈戰時經濟，抑平物信安定民生起見，自積極推行統制物　取締囤積以來　整個國民經濟及物資　簡，逐步趨入正常狀態、惟最近物價雖巳見低落、但鑒於一般商民放棄主要商品及軍需品之囤積之外，對於非必需品之囤積仍復存在，爲强力防止　　囤積操縱　　行為、以　遍性之取締，以安民生，特於前，（十六）日國防會議通渦　正戰時刑毒機操縱或囤貨居寄，足以妨害供求團係或未受允準設立市塲，為類似交易　之買賣、或以　和為目的買物品或操　市塲、　　擾亂市塲　　者　死刑、或無期徒刑、得併科十萬元以下罰金，因此更使一般投機囤機企圖暴利商無由活動，據本市經濟界權威方面人士稱，國府修正戰時刑法條文，確能收調節物資抑制物價更大宏効．昨（十七）日各市塲及私人方面買資交易，均依合法手續經晉，所有以前囤積之物品，莫不抑價脫售、民生由此常更形安定。八月份票據　交換數　　本市銀行樂聯合準備會票據交換所，頃發表入月份票據交換額，計交換數（甲現鈔一·三七一·六四七·三一六·〇八，（乙）劃頭三·九三六·九六三·六二五·七〇，合計五·三〇入·六一〇·九四一·七八、代收數六·六九七·一四六·九一六·四四，總計一二·〇〇五·七五七·八五入·二二，較七月份交換額减少二·二四二·九五一·三入四·六六〇。華股趨勢　　華股日益平庸·昨　日打狹臨範園內紀伏，　資大戶仍待機中、百貨　永安公司獨趨緊　·終捐軋升；新新·國貿·國　公司各凡削低；中國內表低後小囘·紡　業僅大生一嶄原價做開，三廠　永安紡織均　低落；　轉與廣動慶　兩紡　挫落允多。小票面信和所小尚　。美亞·鴻興·新豐·　甡·大中華　造等無一不在疲退中。新藥藥中西。中英·中法·新星藥廠等仍少變化；五洲獨堅；信誼。新亞。九顧裝藥。明星香水均　平波．金融　金城·鑒業大陸仍在向高峰這　中，上　獨稍囘下、中一信托　少變化。文化　商務獨平、中聯與　界同情上升、大中華火榮原價做開；南洋及華成烟公司殊少變化•公用業　　呆。實　般久安。大中雖均關口成交·國雄與中國投資等寶價尙在步小中·能產業新益微降，聯舉　稍囘升。永　呆顧·食品設　生圖標準味品等做價仍在上日價左右。　元製　升後囘底。其他各雜股中儲錢副總裁今晚廣播銀行參加儲蓄週　存戶超過半數以上　中儲錢副總裁今晚廣播　　中央儲備銀行此次倡導人民存款儲蓄，使人民將節約儲落之資金，存入銀行、造成人民財富之　力、更能引導儲蓄之資金，運用於生產事業。而發展國家　　經濟建設　　故策動全市一百六十家銀行參加舉辦儲蓄週，頗爲社會各界所重視，商民莫不樂於儲蓄，且有搖彩得獎之希望，尤其經各參加銀行　力宜傳鼓勵，使一般商民增加儲蓄之興趣、是以參加儲蓄存款之商民，益見踴躍·迄昨日半週間儲蓄戶額巳超過百分之六十以上該行對於參加辦理能蓄之銀行原限於會員銀行。惟因其他　　金融機關　　要求參加者接踵而至，故前（十六）日準中央信託公司及華興銀行參加辦理後，昨（十七）日繼准四行儲蓄會之要求，參加辦理儲蓄適。（又訊）中央儲備銀行副總裁錢大概氏，定於今（十入）日下午八時半，在上海電合廣播「學行　蓄的週意義」云。疏通原料　　本市火柴原料自前年來源中斷後，而滬上存底亦極稀薄，經一二年之消耗，幾成　乏之勢，故市上火柴供應常呈缺貨只現象，一部份因爲囤戶所操縱，但各廠出貨數量亦有限也。最近火柴業聯合會已完成火柴計口配給真體方案，現正交商統　等關係當局　核中，一俟核準即付諸實施，如此辦法一旦實行，則每月所需火柴數量自極浩大，故疏通來源，增加生產，自為急不待援之事。查滬上各火柴廠減工或　停工，現今開工者僅有三四家，故該業聯合會現正與　日關係當道協議疏通原料問題，茲悉巳有相當眉目，一俟原料大最到達，各廠即謀復工簡訊　　中國　柳草器廠股份有限公司係由鄧南記藤柳草器廠擴充改組而成，　設製造廠於億定盤路及蘇州淸河坊，設發行所於靜安寺路及四摩路，該廠導織造美術草地毯，際登　柳傢具我敗　省種草　品，茲摞於本月十九日開幕，該公司董事長爲李祖薰，常務董事鄭舉　，吳文卿林九如鄧信法，總想理鄧原　，經理田和卿。　　英達染　廠係實業家聞　亭潘仰墝待香誕等　資創辦、且有悠久歷史、成績車著、此次再慶增資至三百萬元，且由銀行戶子吳庸　氏出任董事長氏總經理、由常董桂香庭君柬任經理，並新聘慮績氏君為副經理，一八兩區糧食商應加入公會　　本市兩租界自經國府實施收囘後，糧食部在完遂樹立戰時糧食體制原則下，所有第一八兩區轄境內經營糧食之公司行號。均應依法加入各該業同樂公會爲會員，以待功令，而使糧食政策之推行得以步調一致，市糧食局奉令後，昨特公告一八兩區有關氏食之公司行號，一體切實經氏辦理。</p>

<h3>French Local Air Raids - Over Two Thousand Killed and Wounded</h3>
<p>Paris, September 17th, Central News Agency Dispatch - In the past twenty-four hours, Anglo-American air squadrons carried out terrifying air raids over Paris, Nantes, Montluçon, and Chartres. As a result, 558 French citizens were killed, 1,343 were injured, and many residential areas, hospitals, churches, and schools suffered significant damage.</p>
<h3>Smolensk Threat Eliminated - German Announcement of Withdrawal from Novorossisk</h3>
<p>Berlin, September 17th, Central News Agency Dispatch - Official announcement states that German forces have withdrawn from Bryansk, a city in the central region of the front line, and from the port of Novorossisk on the Black Sea.</p>
<p>Berlin, September 17th, Central News Agency Dispatch - German Party authorities announced on the 16th that the focal point of the Eastern Front battle had shifted since dawn on the 14th to the area between the Moscow-Smolensk railway and the Moscow-Roslavl highway. Soviet forces amassed large reserve units and launched a large-scale breakthrough operation against Smolensk, engaging in an unprecedented fierce battle with the defending German forces. The numerical superiority of the Soviet forces gradually pressured the German forces, causing them to retreat to new positions in some areas. However, as soon as reinforcements arrived, they immediately launched a fierce counterattack. As a result, except for a few companies, the Soviet breakthrough units were almost entirely annihilated. Fierce decisive battles also occurred in the northeast of Smolensk. On the 14th and 15th, German forces annihilated four Soviet tank brigades, eliminating the direct threat to Smolensk.</p>
<p>Berlin, September 17th, Central News Agency Dispatch - A German news agency war correspondent reported on the 16th about the situation on the Ukrainian front: On the 15th, Soviet forces again attempted to break through the German defense line in a vast area of the southern sector of the Eastern Front, launching a fierce attack on German positions. However, their offensive was completely repelled by the German forces with skillful tactics. West and northwest of Izyum, the Soviets, under the cover of strong artillery and fighter-bomber squadrons, heavily pressured German positions, but they were stopped by the German forces and suffered great damage. Northwest of Kharkov, Soviet forces launched a major offensive against German positions, and in several places, they briefly broke through, but later German counterattacks were successful. The Soviet army lost eighty-four tanks and was defeated. The German encirclement and annihilation operation against Soviet forces southwest of Kharkov was largely completed on the 15th. So far, the confirmed results of the battle are that 2,500 Soviet soldiers were killed, 600 were captured, and German forces destroyed 110 Soviet tanks and 84 artillery pieces. In addition, three aircraft were captured. In the Nezhin area of northern Ukraine, there have been no changes in the front line, but according to German reconnaissance, Soviet forces continue to amass strong reserve units on that front, seemingly preparing to attack Kyiv, and a large-scale offensive is expected to begin soon.</p>
<h3>US Forces in Salerno Area Tenaciously Defend Beachhead - British Forces Rapidly Deploying Reinforcements</h3>
<p>Berlin, September 17th, Central News Agency Dispatch - The Nautical News Agency reports, according to German reconnaissance aircraft reports: On Wednesday night, the main force of the British army landed at Paestum and Castellabate, including a division of mechanized troops from the British Eighth Army, attempting to advance north along the west coast of Italy to relieve the beleaguered U.S. Fifth Army at Salerno. The majority of these fresh troops are Canadians, and they took over the U.S. defense zone under the cover of darkness. Except for artillery positions, the U.S. troops have retreated to the rear to reorganize and regroup.</p>
<p>Berlin, September 17th, Central News Agency Dispatch - German military comments on the situation in the Salerno area: Although the enemy has a planned advantage, they still feel overwhelmed by the German offensive. General Eisenhower, relying on his large numbers, confidently believed that he could not only establish a beachhead but also quickly advance inland. Marshal Kesselring's strategy was able to quickly establish defensive positions on land and take the offensive in the air, initially cutting the Anglo-American landing forces into two desperate operational units, one driven south of Salerno, and the remnants of the U.S. Fifth Army confined to the coast west of Eboli. But according to the latest twenty-four-hour news, the U.S. military is trying to hold the Salerno beachhead at any cost, and sending large reinforcements into that hellhole, attacking under the cover of naval artillery and air force.</p>
<p>Berlin, September 17th, Central News Agency Dispatch - The Nautical News Agency reports: The losses suffered by the U.S. military in the Salerno area are extremely heavy. In the past twenty-four hours, the Allied forces, under the cover of the British Navy, continued to land strong reinforcements. German forces also continued to gain victories in these twenty-four hours. U.S. forces in Alfadena and Pansana were again repelled, and the British army also retreated in Salerno. The southern flank of the U.S. military and the northern front of the British army are still cut off. The Allied forces sent paratroopers behind German lines in Pozzuoli to disrupt and attempt to improve their positions, but they also failed. The paratrooper unit was completely annihilated. The vanguard of Montgomery's forces advanced from Calabria and should have reached the port of Policastro, but it is still one hundred kilometers from Salerno. Montgomery may advance along the coast towards the southern route of the U.S. military to relieve their siege, but he may also advance towards Seton, and then head north from Lagonegro to Eboli. However, the German command is not paying attention to the fierce fighting in Salerno, but to the actions of the British army after landing in the south.</p>
<p>Berlin, September 17th, Central News Agency Dispatch - The Nautical News Agency reports: The village of Besano, located at the mouth of the Sele River in the Gulf of Salerno, has been occupied by German forces, and hundreds of prisoners have fallen into German hands.

<p>Berlin, September 17th, Central News Agency Dispatch - According to the Xun Tong News Agency, before investigating Mussolini's whereabouts, the German security service chief disguised himself, using his fluent Italian to drink and make merry with Italian sailors. Therefore, twenty-four hours before Badoglio's surrender, he had already learned that Mussolini was imprisoned on the island of Ponza. Security Service Chief Skorzeny immediately sailed to the island in a motor torpedo boat, but Mussolini had already been taken away by seaplane to some unknown location at dawn that day, and he found nothing. He then began a new investigation, and finally obtained a clue in the Gran Sasso Mountains. According to the guards' report, the mountain railway was heavily guarded. Skorzeny then flew in a specially prepared reconnaissance plane to study the terrain and search for landing sites. At the same time, he began to select rescue personnel, choosing 18 people and a paratrooper squad to carry out the rescue. At the time, the guards were panic-stricken and did not fire a single shot, and Mussolini was safely rescued. This investigation was carried out in close cooperation with the Italian intelligence agency and was successfully completed.</p>

<h3>Reduced Cooking Oil Prices to Lighten Burden on Citizens - Household Cooking Oil Sold for 21.42 Yuan Per Catty</h3>
<p>The city's Cooking Oil Trade Wholesale Office, acting on the mandate of the Military Allocation Group, is selling the fifth phase of household cooking oil for the first district, starting on the 15th of this month.

<h3>Press Conference Held by the Reporting Authorities at 7:40 PM Yesterday - Discussion of Weaknesses in Italian Naval Surrender</h3>
<h3>The Axis Camp is Absolutely Unshaken</h3>
<p>The regular press conference hosted by the Japanese Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs authorities in Shanghai was held yesterday on the fifth floor of the Huizhong Hotel. Minister Matsushima of the Navy Reporting Department attended in person, as well as Lieutenant Kanda of the department, Information Section Chief Hirota of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, and Vice Consul Fukuma. The meeting began with Hirota reporting on the situation in Europe over the past week, followed by Matsushima commenting on the weaknesses of the Italian naval surrender, and promoting the inherent spirit of East Asia. The meeting lasted for over two hours.</p>
<p>Remarks by Colonel Matsushima on the Reasons for the Surrender</p>
<p>Matsushima began by saying: "In the history of the world's most glorious fleets, the Spanish Armada and the Russian Baltic Fleet are well-known. The Italian Navy's capitulation this time will leave a stain on history. We have reviewed the weaknesses of the Italian fleet, which include: lack of raw materials; insufficient training; inadequate command; no aircraft carriers; no naval air force; and no fighting spirit. Furthermore, in tracing the reasons for its surrender: lack of raw materials led to the Italian Navy's retreat into British-controlled waters due to a shortage of raw materials. They were forced to surrender before completing their mission. The lack of aircraft carriers and naval air force was a major drawback in combat. Italy believed that it did not need aircraft carriers because it had flight base facilities, which was a big mistake. Because aircraft carriers are mobile bases, they are more effective than land bases. Insufficient training and inadequate command: I have learned that the Italian army was not under the direct command of Prime Minister Mussolini, so training and command were not unified. If Mr. Qianzhong had been directly in command, this shameful act of escape and surrender would never have happened. Insufficient fighting spirit is something we should pay special attention to. Looking at historical facts, exactly forty-nine years ago today, in the Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese navy was defeated by Japan. The army commander, Ding Ruchang, committed suicide after making his last efforts. Ding's courage and benevolence are truly the inherent spirit of an East Asian hero, and I deeply admire this. Comparing this to Italy's surrender, there is a world of difference. The East Asian people must establish the spirit of certain victory. Therefore, I firmly believe that the cooperation between China and Japan will make us unafraid of any powerful enemy when we fight shoulder to shoulder. This belief is further strengthened by the facts. At the same time, on this day of the Jiawu War, I especially hope that the figures in the puppet regime will recognize this historical fact, reflect on it, and consider the policies to be implemented. Finally, from the standpoint of a naval expert, Matsushima said that the Italian fleet's surrender to Britain and the United States has no effect. The Italian fleet has nothing in common with the British and American fleets. There is no equipment on the ships and no weapons that are the same as those of Britain and the United States. Even if Britain and the United States supply military supplies, it will be difficult to do so in time. Especially with the difference in training, it is even more difficult for soldiers to board ships and fight. Therefore, we do not pay attention to the Italian navy's surrender."</p>
<p>Further Discussion of Aviation</p>
<p>Matsushima also talked about the upcoming Aviation Memorial Day and gave a detailed explanation of the excellent training of the Japanese Air Force. Finally, he mentioned the American Air Force in Chongqing oppressing the Chongqing Air Force and poisoning the people in Chongqing. Matsushima first stated that the Japanese Navy Aviation Memorial Day is on the 20th of this month, and all Japanese citizens and overseas Chinese are launching enthusiastic celebrations. The Japanese Army and Navy aviation units are active in various battles in the Pacific, and their forces are excellent. They have been winning great victories and inflicting heavy blows on the enemy. He also said that he met yesterday with an official who was quite experienced in aviation. He had participated in the battles in Hawaii, the Solomon Islands, and Malaysia. He has a wealth of tactical experience and said that the soldiers in the war zone are enthusiastic about serving the country and have established the belief that they will win. Therefore, we have strengthened our belief, and our naval aviation team is always ready to fight in any battle and can achieve victories that are ten or even dozens of times greater than the enemy's. The reasons for the great effect are: concrete training; excellent materials; sufficient preparation of raw materials; and the pilots' skilled technology. We especially expect these excellent technicians to add more glorious records to history in the future. Finally, regarding the Chongqing Air Force, the current Chongqing Air Force is being oppressed by the U.S. 14th Air Force in Chongqing, and the British and American Air Forces in the Far East are poisoning Chinese cities and towns, killing innocent people, which is extremely hateful. This fact should be thoroughly recognized by the Chongqing military, and the past spirit should be used to advance the path of building East Asia, to break away from the slavery of foreign shackles, and to actively defend against foreign aggression and complete the task of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Remarks by Section Chief Hirota</p>
<p>British and American Fantasies</p>
<p>Hirota began by saying: From a diplomatic point of view, when the Italian Badoglio regime betrayed the country, Britain and the United States actually declared that they wanted to dissolve the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, and shake the spirit of the Tripartite Pact. They even had the absurd idea of splitting the relationship between Japan and Germany. However, in fact, this attempt has become a fantasy. The compromise of the Italian Badoglio regime has only made the Axis alliance stronger. On the 15th of this month, the Japanese and German political aides issued a joint statement on this issue. The statement said that although Italy committed this act of treason, we will still increase our obligations under the Tripartite Pact, and in order to achieve the purpose of the Tripartite Pact, Japan and Germany will spare no effort to continue their efforts to achieve final victory. Continuing with military affairs, the armistice agreement between Britain, the United States, and the Italian Badoglio regime stipulated that the British and American allied forces would go to central and southern Italy and land as if entering an uninhabited area, and would even assist the British and American allied forces, leading them to northern Italy to suppress the German army. But the fact is that when the British and American allied forces landed, they had no internal support, and the Italian army only automatically abandoned their weapons.</p>
<p>German Strength Hirota further said: "In the central and southern regions, the strength of the German garrison is huge, and it is difficult for the British and American troops to land as they wish. The landing at Salerno was frustrated by the German army, and MacArthur was forced to flee by ship. At the same time, the German army in central and southern Italy used its army to drive the British and American allied forces to southern Italy. This sharp momentum has not only established a European fortress in Italy, but also in the entire European theater. In addition, Britain and the United States originally planned to install a puppet government in Rome and sent New York Mayor La Guardia as supervisor. (La Guardia stopped in Italy and has now been naturalized in the United States.) However, this attempt failed due to the failure of the Badoglio regime, and La Guardia was unable to succeed. Furthermore, after Italian Prime Minister Mussolini was rescued by Germany on September 13, the British and American sides, especially the United States, had previously designated him as a major target, intending to overthrow Mussolini and the Fascist Party, so they used magic to promote the Badoglio regime's armistice, even intending to extradite Mussolini to Washington, and Roosevelt and Churchill made a joint political judgment and mobilized domestic newspapers, movie theaters, and all other propaganda machines to expand the hype, making it a fait accompli. However, this inhumane and despicable act by</p>
<h3>On the System of Studying Abroad: Reflections After Reading Japan's Decision on Guiding Policies for Students Studying in Japan</h3>
<p>Since the Opium War, Chinese people have been shocked by the advanced science and technology of Western countries, including the functions of sound, light, chemistry, and electricity. They believed that if they could imitate these things one by one, the nation would surely become wealthy and powerful. Therefore, they strongly advocated for studying abroad. However, those in charge at the time lacked foresight and were eager for quick success. They did not have detailed plans or comprehensive considerations regarding the age and academic level of the students sent, the suitability of the subjects of study to domestic needs, or the assignment of personnel for supervision and guidance. As a result, in the beginning, they sent young children and minors abroad in droves. These people had not yet matured in their studies at home, and their wills were not yet firm. Once they entered a foreign country, the circumstances were completely different. Each country has its own unique environment and national character. With immature minds, they were easily influenced by the environment. After returning to China, many were arrogant and looked down on everything. Their lifestyle, diet, and clothing were all Europeanized. They could read Western books in the original language, but they were clueless about even the most basic Chinese newspapers. However, at the time, there was a blind belief about those who returned from studying abroad, assuming that they were ready with talent after being "gilded" overseas, and they were entrusted with important responsibilities. In reality, transforming a nation and society is not an easy task. Without a deep understanding and research into the customs, political system, and economy of their own country, bearing heavy responsibilities rashly would not only be futile but also lead to failure. This was the failure of the initial system of studying abroad.</p>
<p>Later, although improvements were gradually made, over the decades, there was no shortage of outstanding individuals among those who returned after studying diligently, especially in the fields of technology and science, where they achieved relatively good results. However, from the perspective of the overall policy of studying abroad, it was still a failure.</p>
<p>China and Japan were both countries that sent students to study in the West, and the timing was similar. However, Japan benefited from its policy of studying abroad far more than China. In terms of academic ability, Chinese students studying abroad were by no means inferior to Japanese students. However, in terms of achievements in their careers after returning home, Chinese students lagged far behind Japanese students. Upon careful examination, the reason for the difference lies in the different methods of sending students abroad. The Japanese government sent students abroad who were generally older and had "special insights and rich experience." As mentioned earlier, China sent mostly young children and youths. Chinese students only gained textbook knowledge from the classroom, while Japanese students gained both social and career experience. Because of the differences in what they gained, their achievements after returning home were also different. By comparison, Japan's method of selecting students to study abroad was far superior to China's; this is an obvious fact. Only in the last decade has China's method of selecting students to study abroad improved. For example, in the past, the students selected by Tsinghua School were all young children aged thirteen or fourteen. After a little preparation in foreign languages and general knowledge, they were sent to the United States. What they gained in the United States were graduation diplomas and master's and doctoral degrees. When it came to practical knowledge, they had no genuine understanding of either Chinese or Western society. Later, it was stipulated that only after graduating from university could one take the exam. After passing the exam, they had to stay in the country for a year to gain work experience before going abroad to study. What these students gain abroad is bound to be far greater than that of the former Tsinghua students. Therefore, the improvement in the method of selecting students to study abroad is closely related to the effectiveness of the policy of studying abroad.</p>
<p>Today, Japan's national power is strong, while our national power is weak. Although there are many reasons for this, it can also be seen from a comparison of the policies of studying abroad that strength and weakness are not accidental. Now, our national society needs construction and revitalization, and the urgency is no less than it was after the Opium War. We must, of course, pay close attention to the policy of studying abroad and make necessary improvements.</p>
<p>Our friendly neighbor Japan's technology, science, economics, politics, and law have undergone continuous experimentation and research. Not only are they far more advanced than ours, but they also hold outstanding positions compared to other countries in the world. This provides much for our students to learn. At a time when China and Japan are working together to build East Asia, cultivating talent is a matter of utmost urgency. On July 11, this newspaper published Zhang Chaojun's "Review and Discussion of the System of Studying Abroad" in its weekly commentary, which proposed a general outline for the system of studying abroad. We will not repeat it here. Today, we are specifically publishing an article titled "Japan's Decision on Guiding Policies for Students Studying in Japan" (see page 4 of this newspaper). We strongly agree with the friendly nation Japan's policies and methods for guiding students studying in China. We would like to briefly express our thoughts as follows:</p>
<p>In the past, Chinese students studying in Japan were the largest in number, had the longest history, were geographically closest, and had the most similar written language compared to students from other countries. Logically, there should be the most talent who could understand Japanese. However, the current reality is that the most lacking and commonly felt pain is the lack of Japanese interpreters and Japanese translation talent. Therefore, if language and writing between China and Japan cannot be freely and smoothly communicated, then to boast about cultural exchange is bound to be a case of doing twice the work for half the results.</p>
<p>In the past twenty years, the Chinese publishing industry has published many translations of English and American books, but fewer translations of Japanese books. This is not because Japan lacks excellent works, nor is it because the Chinese publishing industry has prejudices against Japanese works, but entirely due to the lack of talent proficient in Japanese.</p>
<p>Comparing the academic subjects of Chinese students studying in Japan, although there are no accurate statistics, it is generally assumed that too few study practical subjects such as industry and agriculture, while they tend towards politics and law. The concept of being an official rather than doing work can be tested here.</p>
<p>Chinese students have a comparatively good emotional attachment to their country of study; this is a fact. Under this fact, the difficulty of achieving unanimous understanding and even inclination towards Japanese policies in the short term is also a fact. Therefore, in order to jointly build Greater East Asia, actively cultivating key talent is essential.</p>
<p>We are very grateful for Japan's newly established guiding policies for students studying abroad. For the sake of cultivating talent to build East Asia ten or twenty years from now, we cannot neglect strict training today. Because the lack of talent today is the result of not paying attention to strict training ten or twenty years ago. In the past, Japan's management of Chinese students was too lenient, resulting in a scarcity of talent proficient in Japanese today. We hope that the Japanese education authorities will pay attention to this. At the same time, we hope that Japan will also send students to China to cultivate a foundation of genuine mutual understanding between Chinese and Japanese youth. This is our suggestion.</p>

<h3>Kurusu Speaks on Radio to Central and South America Urging Cooperation to Strive for National Liberation</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th – Mr. Kurusu Saburo, the former special envoy to the United States, delivered a radio address to Central and South America at the Tokyo Central Broadcasting Station on the 17th. The main points are as follows: People of Latin America, we are now fighting for the liberation of Greater East Asia, just as your ancestors fought for the liberation of Latin America about 150 years ago. The tide of national liberation has now surged to East Asia. The one billion people of Greater East Asia are carrying out the Greater East Asia War with the same spirit that the countries of South America once fought for their independence. Britain and the United States also once fought for their liberation and freedom, but their spirit of love for freedom fossilized at the same time as they established their hegemony. Britain and the United States now claim to be freedom fighters of the world and publicize this, but as far as the East is concerned, have they ever given freedom to the peoples of Greater East Asia? The ideal of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is not to separate Greater East Asia from the world and stand aloof, but to enable each country to cooperate with the world in its proper position. The current policy towards China adopted by Japan is based on this ideal. Since China recently recovered the Shanghai Concession, it has become the master of its own home for the first time since the Opium War. The 400 million people of China are now unanimously engaged in the liberation movement. The Philippines and Burma, which were damaged in the war, have been restored, and the construction of political economy is also actively underway. Burma achieved independence on August 1, and the Philippines will soon become independent. The anti-British atmosphere in India is also surging throughout India. All these surging wills and efforts of the East Asian nations, which have been the long-accumulated desires of these nations, are now being fulfilled thanks to Japan's victory. The United States has now hung the whole world under the American gold-made cross. Those Latin American countries that can follow this policy will only become "docile servants" of the United States. Will you fight again for independence, or will you surrender unconditionally to American economic imperialism? The time for you to choose is now.</p>
<h3>Germany's Strategy Unchanged: Northern Italian Front Impregnable</h3>
<p>What impact will the betrayal of the Three-Power Pact by Badoglio have on the European war situation and the world war situation? What are Germany's plans for the future war situation, fighting a strong enemy in the east? Mr. Kato, the president of the Berlin branch of Mainichi Shimbun, spoke to the head office via international long-distance call on the afternoon of the 9th as follows:</p>
<p>Head Office: What are Germany's views on the surrender of the Badoglio regime?</p>
<p>Kato: On this point, the German Foreign Ministry has already issued a statement today. The German side believes that Badoglio's defection is a deliberate criminal act. His crime is a betrayal of the fascist government led by Mussolini and the representatives of the Italian people. Therefore, Germany has been fully prepared since Mussolini's downfall and has not wavered in the slightest. The German people are extremely calm after hearing the government's announcement.</p>
<p>Head Office: Japan is also equally calm. I believe this is the result of the unity of the Japanese and German spirit and everyone's belief in certain victory. What is the situation regarding the establishment of a new government in northern Italy?</p>
<p>Kato: This point has already been announced. The German people are extremely calm after hearing about it, and they are even more strengthened after hearing Mussolini's firm rise to help complete the war against Britain and the United States. Currently, all that is known is that a new government has been established. As for its organizational structure, etc., it is not clear. How this government will cooperate to defeat Britain and the United States, and the organization of the government's core military force, etc., is also not clear. The location is a small metropolitan city in northern Italy near the German-Italian border.</p>
<p>Head Office: What about the future operations of the German army in Italy?</p>
<p>Kato: I think the enemy will still land in various parts of Italy in the future! However, the German army's strategy of defeating the enemy has not changed much. It will carry out operations in accordance with the established policy. Perhaps it will adopt a tactic of luring the enemy to the north and annihilating them in one fell swoop. Some people believe that there will be small contacts with the Southern Italian army. Perhaps such things have already happened, but such things will not have any impact on the overall war situation.</p>
<p>Head Office: What about the Italian army on the Eastern Front and in the Balkans?</p>
<p>Kato: Currently, the Italian army on the Eastern Front has been in the rear, and their numbers are not a problem.</p>
<p>Head Office: What is the news about the Japanese expatriates in Italy?</p>
<p>Kato: Because communications between Berlin and Rome have been cut off, the situation is unclear. In short, we must promote the spirit of the Three-Power Pact. Japan, Germany, and the newly reborn fascist new government must be united as one, hold a belief in certain victory, and work hard to defeat Britain and the United States. This is the most important thing. This is what the German people generally think. (Qing Qing: Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun, September 11)</p>
