<h3 id="c1">上海敎育上的危機 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>上海租界接收以來，當局方集中精力於政治及經濟方面的更張與建樹，不過，社會上也有一般熱心而有遠見的人士，認爲以上海地位之重要，今後文化敎育設施之改善，對於全國的影響，決非淺鮮，有關當局，對此亦宜兼籌並顧，以求進步。關於上海敎育事業之改善，久聞當局盡力籌謀，且已不乏見諸事實者。我們也曾一再獻言，聊供參考。現在僅就目前若干急於改善的現象，看來似乎輕微者，略陳所見，以供獻於本市敎育當局。</p>
<p>學風問題，向爲辦敎育者所最感棘手的。事變前後，尤使有心人士惄焉憂之。但最近幾年來的上海學風，確是比較有了好的傾向，我們聽不到什麼學潮，也看不到學生鬧政治風潮的事實。這當然是敎育當局疏導於無形的成績。但是青年的活動性舆活動力是舆生俱来的。當一穜活動原因消失以後，就很可能向其他方面找出路，於是，有些青年就不免流於一穜畸形的现象：　是對國家社會問題之漠不關心的態度；　是個人主義之絕端的發展，成爲自私自利的態度；　是走上浪漫，放縱與類廢墮落之途。</p>
<p>第一種現象，可於各大中學的一部分考試成績中見之，一般的說，對於時事的認識都比較的要差些。第二種現象更爲普遍，不少學生之讀書，只爲了取得一種資格，視作個人出處的護符，至於學些什麼？對社會對國家的責任是什麽？皆非所問。至於第三種現象，就是上述兩種現象的發展，男女學生，互以到學校找「對象」爲目的，於是油頭粉臉，衣香履滑，在校裹鬼混了一趟，就到校外去花天酒地，歌樓舞池，影院劇塲，是常常涉足的塲所。雖然只是一部分的現象，但是這種現象之存在，却是不容否認的事實。</p>
<p>學校中如此畸形及不良現象的發展，表面上雖然看不到什麼，實際上對於民族前途，眞是致命的因素。我們敢於大胆的說，爲了國家民族的前途，則激於情感衝動而常鬧風潮的學生，與目前一部分男女學生不知進修學業，但知打扮得花枝招展地踏上頹廢墮落之路！兩相比較，後者實更不足取。因爲縱有政治上任何錯誤的思想與行動，但不失爲表現共對國家社會的關心愛護，如果能用適當方法，不難導使走上正軌。可是，心理上對國家社會根本漠視，只知享樂盡歡者，却不能不說是敎育上最大的危機。我們今天沒有什麼特別的對策矯正畸形現象，只求先實踐下列兩點；以爲澈底改善的試騐。　對於大中學男生，一律剃光頭，不准穿西裝及華美服裝，不必着皮鞋。　對於女學生，不准燙髮，不准蓄長髮，不准敷粉，衣服尤須樸素。我們爲什麼要特別舉出這兩點似乎小節的事呢？主要的是想從此振作男女學生的新精神。同時也是實踐戰時生活，厲行節約運動所必需的起碼條件。因爲剃光頭，可以减少許多理髮時間，抹油之資。目前西裝一套，動輙數千元，皮鞋一雙，不下千元，均爲節約之對象。餘如女生之不燙髮，不蓄長髮與男生剃光頭同樣意義，不敷粉與衣服樸索，不但爲厲行節約，且應爲女孩子純潔天眞的最好表見，應視爲最光榮的事。也就是我們一向主張的凡事須從遠大處着眼，從近易處下手。以上兩點要求，似乎不會過苛吧！</p>
<p>今日無論大中小學，另一最嚴重的現象是各級敎職員生活之艱苦，日前建議創辦敎職員消費合作社的蔣壽同君說，現在大學敎授的收入不及一個黃包車夫，小學敎員的收入不及一般娘姨阿媽。試想爲我們敎育子弟，爲國家社會培植人材的敎師，旣過着連黃包車夫娘姨阿媽也不如的生活，我們的社會是什麼社會？我們的國家是怎樣的國家？視敎師誠不如奴隸，而我們尙欲以「敎育成績不良』，「學風頹敗」等責任完全推在敎師們身上，實在太不公道了！所以任何改善敎育，提高效率的辦法，最基本的還是要從改善敎師生活開始，只有常敎師的生活得到合理的維護，敎師的地位獲得充分的保障之後，才能進而嚴密師資的選用，才能使其擔負起神聖的責任。所可惜的，到現在爲止，關於改善敎師生活，還只有紙面的文章，還只聽到口頭的理論，就有少數加薪的事實，實際上因爲和物價的比率仍是差的太遠，總是無脾於事。我們今天特別希望敎育當局以最大的努力，設法提高敎職員待遇，務使各級敎職員生活之安定。當他們生活無憂之後，纔可以求其盡職，否則，食不得一飽，家不得贍養，而天天要求他們仟重致遠，老實說，是絕對辦不到的！社會上不少敎育成績不良及學生風習不善，歸咎於一般敎職員，我們敢在這裹代爲剖陳，如果敎職員的生活一天不如黃包車夫娘姨阿媽，則敎育成績與靑年風習就一天不會提高與矯正，敎育上的危機，就不可能澈底消除。　敎育當局重視之。</p>

<p>隨着世界戰局的演變，防空也就成為必要的措置了，於是防空的空氣這幾天就迷漫了全北京。除了各要人到處演講防空的重要外，華北常局又下令自九月一日起八日間舉行全華北防空演習。這一次的防空演習比從前不同的有三點：第一，遍及全華北，不僅是北京一市；第二，第三國人也為着順應實踐而參加演習；第三，每次報告通告警報等，都附「演習」兩字，免得與眞正空襲相混。八月十九日北京防衛司令部而且還召集了北京特別市軍警防團及各特別警防分團代表頒示防空演習的實施計劃。據報紙上所披露的實施事項，這一次的防空演習規模實在是很大的，</p>
<p>另一方面，十九日在中　公園揭幕的航空觀摹展也是值得注意的一椿事。展覽的塲所在水榭，一共有三室。第一室是介紹各種飛機圖樣標幟和模型的。壁上懸有六幅在渝美機的掛圖：　北阿美利加B25型中轟炸機，　加悌斯P40型戰機鬥機　　夫留斯達SB型戰鬥機，　波音B17型重轟炸機（即空中堡壘），　康索利達特B24重轟炸機，　洛克西德P38型重臨逐機。並有模型式機，加以詳細說明，給戰時的市民不少空戰的知識。第二室是介紹靑島的航空運動實况的。其中懸有實物六分之一大的兩個滑翔空機。第三室是指明各秤防空兵器的用法及其力量的。這種　覧會一共只有三天，二十一日下午就要結束。這總算是戰爭期中一個極有意義的展覽會了。由此亦可窺見北京防空遝動的熱烈。　（八月二十日學子寄）</p>

<p>南京二十四日中央社電　日駐　派遣軍在中國大陸前綫，不斷　擊各地渝軍，屢獲偉大戰果。茲中國派遣軍報道部，已於廿四日發表七月份綜合戰果，以此與上年七月之戰果相比較，則渝軍作戰兵力約减二萬八千入，截獲軍器中大砲六十五門，重輕機機减二〇百七挺，反之，被俘及歸順者激增約六千人，觀此即足證明渝軍因戰意低下，及缺乏重兵器，致戰力日　低下此外在截獲軍器中　　槍顯有增加，於此可知渝軍因缺乏之大砲，故用步槍補充，渝方之憂慮亦由　可　、而渝軍主要武器手溜彈之激增，更亦足暴露其大砲原料之不足，而日軍陣亡者與上年七月相較减少五〇九人，此亦足以證明日軍戰術之進步，及士氣之旺盛。</p>

<p>瑞典京城二十匹日中央社電　德軍自卡禾夫撤退後，東綫中南部戰局已步入新階段。據倫教軍事專家推測，卡科夫方面德軍在强力後衛部隊掩護下，漸次西進，同時於聶伯河沿岸調集預備兵、即將開始大反攻，故蘇軍必須在卡利夫西南八十里之波爾太伐市周圍防備德軍之猛攻。又據莫斯科電稱，迂迥卡科夫西進之蘇軍部隊，已進至波爾太伐北方。又卡科夫東南之蘇軍部隊，進迫唐納資至密烏斯兩河西岸地點，已在卡科夫　南百七十哩之伏洛希羅夫格勒西南，與德軍展開激戰。</p>

<p>南自所羅門海城北至阿留申羣島，在南北太平洋的海上補給戰中，曾經激烈戰事的運輸船〇〇丸　在海面上發出迅急的引擎聲疾駛着。模糊的桅檣上，點點彈痕，隱約可辨，這是曾在南方的補給戰中受敵方格拉曼戰鬥　的攻擊而加以擊退的一種新鮮的紀錄。</p>
<p>出死入生</p>
<p>在船首及船尾，對空中及對潛水艇的監視片刻不懈。穿着厚的毛皮外套的監視員，手握望遠鏡，凝視着鉛色的水平戰，似乎在等待着誰的模樣。太陽　在出航前露面、空中是一片沉重的鉛色的曇，白色的濃霧，籠罩着海面，縮小了監視員們的視野。襯衫上下，穿了一套棉織的外裝之外，再套上毛織的背心，全部防寒衣服都穿在身上，可是冷氣仍從我們足邊所立的甲板上颼颼地襲到全身。船員們在甲板上極為忙碌。幾次從九死一生中逃得性命的他們，已歷經磨練，習以為常丁。隨便問那一個船員，都坦然地異口同聲的說：「如其怕潛水艦，怕飛機，怕船沉沒的就不能乘船。而寒冷在這北洋的海面是極普通的事。」記者見到戰時船員的活躍情形，不由得垂下</p>
<p>國之花</p>
<p>闇夜彌漫開來，在什麼也看不見的海而上，夜光蟲發着微弱的光，時明時滅。濃霧從左右漸漸地襲到　大的甲板上來，燈火業已完全管制的本船，祗靠着一只羅針盤在北洋　面上摸紮前進。我在向某地前進途中，浮上水面，悠然航行，敵人潛水艦如被我們的乘船發見，必無倖免，到明天就有擊退的故事傳來。但在當夜却不能知道新鮮的事情。船上的每一個人都有這種氣　。</p>
<p>「還在危險的海面嗎？」</p>
<p>「本船快要到拋錨地了。」</p>
<p>「太辛苦了！」</p>
<p>「那裏，那是戰時下乘船航行的常事。」</p>
<p>老船長張大着口，心無二念地注視着羅針盤。室的一角，一朶沒有名字的北國之花，散發着馥郁的香味，佈滿了全室、</p>
<p>外　，　烈的冷風在吹着。濃霧依然籠罩着黑板。手表上的時光正指着午前一時。縮在外套的襟裏，立在甲板上的記者，眼中所見到的，祗兀立在霧的海面上的監視兵的姿態。呼呼地在耳邊響過的厲風中，凜然地兀立着繼續在監視。我們好似見到了一幅名畫，體內感到一種熱烈的激動。後來在幾天後的下午，閃耀的太陽陰暗下來，我們不禁大為喜悅。在盛夏中航行北海，必須具有可驚的耐苦力，令靜的心境，卓越的技術，以及旺盛的鬥志。而遠征北洋的運輸船上的船員們，都具備了這一切，並且又切身體騐到飽滿的士氣，所以時常親切地想到日本船員的長處。</p>
<p>太陽開恩</p>
<p>海面上的霧時明時滅。在這朔北的第一綫，眺望到一碧如洗的晴空，這在將士們比什麼都來得快活。有時那晴空的一端，霎時問北國的陽光直射下來，將士們連脫雨衣外套都來不及，大聲歡叫着：「太陽先生的殊恩。」盛開的北國之花，一朶朶散放着冷香的霧雰，頂刻　濡附着上衣及外套上，而颼颼的冷氣，又從足下直逼上來，這裹是負有建設某種隊基地飛行塲的重要任務。這部隊的勇士們，自黎明至日暮，毫無休息的作他們的日常　課，在北國的森林間工作着。我們看見有一種不滿一米的匍松，它的根盤曲在四面八方，要拔除這根，需要非常的努力。而在其叢生的地帶，要連根拔起，　為困難。為了要開闢這北國的森林，勇士們連睡眠飲食的時問都極為寳貴，他們自己知道必須在指定的日子之前　工，不能近延幾　。氣魄雄壯</p>
<p>氣魄雄壯</p>
<p>從　晨對黃昏，運用　渾身的活力在工作，那是嚴厲的無休止的氣魄之表現。無論那一軍隊中，那氣魄都極旺盛。在這些勇士們看來，自然的惡劣條件，早已不成問題了，在糢糊的霧中的臨時宿舍之前，勇十們簡略地用着寒冷的食盒中所盛的餐食，他們的眼晴似嘗到了　　　　　着，他們的　　，充滿了旺盛的食慾所　　的臉色。在中膳後的休息中，一面用滿粘着泥的　黑手的，拾起粘在地上的飯粒，細細地咀嚼。一面三三五五地聚集攏來聽我們講家鄉的事情。那完全是舒暢而攸閑的風景。</p>
<p>每天所見到的，觸目都是勇士們欣喜的臉色，匍松的叢林，及鉛色的霧與天空。在這基地的勇士們看來，我們的訪問，實是非常難得的慰安。「哈！好幾天沒有見到鄉里故人的臉顏了……。」年輕的軍曹回顧着自己這樣說。「你們辛苦了……。」這是我們所能表現的慰間的言辭。「因為我是隊長，所以聽到阿圖島的玉碎事件，覺得腸斷肝裂地憤慨着。」「我不忘阿圖島死難的兄弟們的可哀情形，我誓必報兄弟們的仇……」軍士們口口聲聲地說着這種決心。（　：譯自八月十四日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<h3 id="c42">收買配給與生產 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>戰時經濟的基本對策，在於促進物資交流，乃爲不易的原則。物資與金融，猶如人體的血脈，不可一刻不流通，稍有阻滯疾病即隨之而生。所以，經濟血脈，必須時時加以檢査，不容其有絲毫凝滯之處。</p>
<p>講到促進物資交流的辦法，似當包括三個要點：　收買，　配給，　生產，因爲：收買而後物資不至留滯於囤戶之門，配給而後物資可以共有共享，生產而後物資有其接濟之源與流通之路。</p>
<p>可是，要圖滑地履行以上三點，也絕不如理想的那般容易：譬如，由於上海所存棉紗十九萬四千八百三十九件中，竟有十五萬件，未曾登記，則知收買須防隱匿與不報；由於不吸捲菸者，以軋菸爲生財之道，不需牛奶者，以申請牛奶爲佐楊梅，進咖啡之用，則知配給須防冒領與朦報；由於本年棉花收成，較去年增加三成，總收成可達四百萬擔，則知生產之原料，不可謂不多，而振興工業之基本力量，即在於盡量使用土產原料；故戰時而言增產，須防工廠原料之匱乏。</p>
<p>總之一句話，物資與金融，同爲戰時經濟的血脈，最要融通，切忌凝滯。這是政府的責任，同時也是經躋界的責任。</p>

<p>— 潔茹</p>
<p>一價初夏的早晨。淑英懷了昨天包女士給她的那封介紹信，向着這條幽蒨的安和寺路出發。車在霞飛路最後的一個站頭上停下來，她便往西逕直的走去，靜僻的街這，很少有人來往，微風把兩旁的樹　擦得瑟瑟的作響，她在××號的門口被一方一莫釐沈寓」的銅牌吸引住了。覺得心裏有些震盪，她覺得去敲一家陌生人的門，會比向人家借錢的事還要難受。</p>
<p>鐵門上的視圈小洞終於開了，塡上來的是兩隻神秘的黑眼珠。</p>
<p>「這裏是沈家嗎？」淑英公式般的問了一聲。</p>
<p>『是的，你是那一位？」</p>
<p>「我姓方，是找沈先生的。」</p>
<p>鐵門開啓了，淑英被招待着進了西廂的客廳。廳正中，懸着一幅很大的人像油畫，是一個四十來歲的男子，圓臉上嵌着兩隻圓而且小的眼睛，脣上蓄着兩撇歐化小鬍子，大概是這裏的主人了，不知兩個孩子生得怎樣？」淑英想着。</p>
<p>不一會，樓上下來兩個孩子，他們好奇的眼光，牢釘在　英的　上，覺得妙很慈和，便毫不顧忌的在一旁玩起來了。</p>
<p>淑英拉住了一個女孩子的手間道：</p>
<p>「小朋友，你叫甚麼名字？」</p>
<p>「我叫阿靜，他是阿裕。」</p>
<p>『你們歡喜念書嗎？」</p>
<p>大的搖搖頭，小的呆望着他的姊姊。</p>
<p>「你們很喜歡玩吧，我跟你們一起玩好嗎？」</p>
<p>沈守義接過了那封介紹信坐在椅子上在看，沈太太依在門框上站着，好似在監視着他的丈夫。半晌，沈守義站起身來悠然的說：</p>
<p>「哦，先生就是××女師大的方先生，久仰久仰，兩個孩子能得到方先生的敎誨，眞是幸運極了，不　這裏的待遇很非薄，束修我暫定四百元錢一月，鐘點是早晨九時起至晚上六時。方先生覺得怎樣？」</p>
<p>淑英躊躇沉吟了一會，而後說：</p>
<p>「可以的。」</p>
<p>「那末就請方先生明天五號就來，書籍用品我都先會預備的。」</p>
<p>「很好。」</p>
<p>這時　沈太太已經領了孩子到裏面去了，</p>
<p>淑英正要起身告辭的時候沈守義一面瞇矓了眼睛窺看着淑英的姿色，一面又把手裏的信揭開來看了說：</p>
<p>「先生原籍陝西！」「是的。」</p>
<p>「一個人在上海？」「是的。」</p>
<p>「現在是獨身？」『唔！」</p>
<p>「那麼一價人怎樣生活？」「所以才來敎書。」</p>
<p>「好極了，先生自食其力，可敬可佩。」</p>
<p>做家庭教師是一件困難的事，英總算對一行沒有欠缺，可是一天到晚俘着他們厮混，倒也是一件　事。</p>
<p>一天。沈太太因事出門去了，女傭來說沈先生請他上樓去商議事情，英便提心吊胆的帶着兩個孩子上去，女傭也在後而跟着。</p>
<p>「沈先生，有甚麼事見敎？」「唔！有些事要跟你商量，請坐！請坐！」他又囘頭向女傭「你領孩子去買包巧格力來。」</p>
<p>英知道這是調虎離山計，在一刹之間便會有一種危險事發生，牠的心儲在跳着，可是臉上遝不覺得怎樣的恐懼，她勉強把自己的態度裝得很自然的樣子，沉着臉合着嘴像一個待判決的囚犯，她在緊集如應有的反抗勇氣。</p>
<p>「請坐，密史方。」他很雍容的表示着說。</p>
<p>「你不能這樣的稱呼我，」她含着怒意她說。</p>
<p>「好，那我仍叫你方先生，方先生，我看你也是一個聰明人，雖道總明人沒把他的前途打算盪嗎？我眞替你太可惜了！」</p>
<p>烈的慾火，在他的心中蠟燒着，臉上題着一種不能形容的神色，他像一隻　性暫　的野獸祗要紛他找到一個很小的機會，他立刻會撲到淑英的身上去把他殘忍的吞噬掉。</p>
<p>「甚麼話！不知恥的東西！　束末大的年紀還要這般荒唐。你姓沈。我姓方。我　我的家庭敎師，可惜不可價，　你有甚麼相干？請放得正　此　別丟　！」</p>
<p>淑英把這預防了的話，　連矢般的向着他擊夫侃侃像在訓戒一個惡劣的孩子，沒給他留一點點可以反抗的餘地。</p>
<p>「咦！方先生，這是甚麼意思？你別誤會了我的好意，你既然不想甚麼發展，又何必要發這末大的火氣？現在大家又不相蝕此甚麼東西。」守義如事不妙連忙自圓打謊地申辯爭。</p>
<p>正巧沈太太在這時候叫來，一日他兩人在室裏爭辯，不得不疑慮地說：</p>
<p>「你們在　甚麼？孩子呢？」</p>
<p>淑英未免覺　有些臉紅，而那老刁巨滑的沈守義即哈哈的聾了聳　說，</p>
<p>「沒甚麼，你瞧他要向我預支些薪水，我一時沒答應他，他便惱得這個樣子。哈哈，好大的火氣！孩子跟徐媽買糖去了快將囘來了。」</p>
<p>五日的傍晚，沈守義持了一隻黃色的信封走進營室來，一見了淑英，臉上便裝着笑意說，「方先生，這是你本月份的薪水，請點一點。」說罷便把身子往沙發上一倒，盡量的在吸着他的烟斗。淑英接過了信封，便也老實不客氣的把裏面信箋連鈔票拉了出來，他先看那張字條：</p>
<p>「茲收到沈府敎俸四百元，內隊午請費二百五十元正此致</p>
<p>沈守義先生　收</p>
<p>六月五日」</p>
<p>淑英見丁這收據單子</p>
<p>心裏不由得一怔：</p>
<p>「啊！午膳也要扣錢嗎？」</p>
<p>「那當然，何况地在的米價這樣貨，聘約也沒有註明這一條。」「這些錢、我知道你方先生萬不夠用。我也很想多幫助你些，可是……儘利與義務是對立的？哈哈！假如你能同意，我倒有個辦法。」</p>
<p>英見他越不是道理，率性背過身去不睬他。守義見他默不作聲，以爲是着了迸兒。於是他慢慢的向着　背後踱去，臉上更充　着猙獰的得意神色，他站在淑英的身後，伸長了鷹鼻，儘力地吸着她頭上的髪香，一雙魔手也隨着他口　的聲浪向着他的身上摟去：</p>
<p>「這辦法一點也不難實行，尤其像你這樣的孤單人，」</p>
<p>「呸！你這沒有人性的豬仔！」淑英突然旋轉　來向他的臉上一啐　現着神聖不可侵犯的神色，恨恨的掙脫了他的手，大踏出的囘去了。</p>

<p>「延春，延春！」</p>
<p>延春止聚精會神地寬他底長篇創在，驟聽得妻的叫喊，他運忙擱下了　，低低地問，「瑾如，要喝開水嗎？」</p>
<p>「不。自病了以後。已有兩星期沒有正式吃飯了，今大，我　得有點餓，想吃一點粥。」</p>
<p>「噢，我馬卜煮」。延春連忙囘答着。</p>
<p>裝米的口袋像主人一樣餓着肚子躺在地椒上，延春明知是沒有，但是他不放心似的拿起來看了一下：「拿什麽煮給瑾如吃呢？」他簡直茫然了。</p>
<p>延春等他底妻熟睡的時候，把板箱輕輕開了，如小偷似的把棉衣突衣檢着疊在一起。</p>
<p>小白貓從窗沿上跳進房間裏，這巨大的聲響把正在睡意鄕裏的妻驚醒了，她注視着眼前的一幕：「延春，做什麼呀？」</p>
<p>「今天天氣好，這此衣服；拿出去曬曬太陽，免得霉壞。</p>
<p>「唉！　都是我底了作，我病了，累你煮飯，生爐子，洗衣服，以及一切瑣碎的事悄，延春，我眞不知怎樣感激你。」</p>
<p>「瑾如，多說話會傷神，你還是歇歇，等會粥煮好了就端來。」其實鍋子仍冷淸　地躺在未生火的爐子上，那見來的米，延春等着妻閉目養神的時候他挾着包兒出門了。</p>
<p>太陽強烈地照耀在大地上，馬路上的行人非常多，「假如碰到熟人怎辦呢？一延春胆怯地注視着每一個迎面的路人。好容易走到西河街的如生當：「先生，這幾件衣服。」</p>
<p>「嗯，」那個帶眼　的先生朝他看了一下，把包兒打開了：「這五件衣服，你要當多少？」</p>
<p>「二百塊。」</p>
<p>「嘿嘿……好大的口氣，過時的衣服，要當二百塊，拿去，這裏是一百塊。」</p>
<p>延春默默地接受了。</p>
<p>歸途中，把衣服質來的錢全部換了米。</p>
<p>延春　耗子似的從灶間踱進了前房，妻仍安然的睡着，他故意咳了一聲，妻伸着懶腰醒了：「延春，粥煮好了沒有。」囘答着：「你現在就吃　」瑾如吃了幾口囘味着。</p>
<p>「也許你底胃口好，瑾如，你多吃一碗，等身體復原了，我們一同去看夏　底馬路風光。」</p>
<p>「這樣，又可增加你的寫作題材了。」</p>

<h3 id="e1">Crisis in Shanghai Education <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai concessions were received, the authorities have concentrated their efforts on changes and constructions in political and economic aspects. However, there are also a group of enthusiastic and forward-looking people in the society who believe that with the importance of Shanghai's position, the improvement of cultural and educational facilities in the future will have a profound impact on the whole country. Relevant authorities should also take this into consideration for progress. Regarding the improvement of education in Shanghai, it has long been heard that the authorities are doing their best to plan, and there have been many things that have come to fruition. We have also repeatedly offered suggestions for reference. Now, we will just briefly present our views on some phenomena that urgently need to be improved, which seem minor at first glance, for the consideration of the educational authorities in this city.</p>
<p>The issue of academic atmosphere has always been the most difficult for educators to deal with. Before and after the incident, it made those who cared deeply worry. However, in recent years, the academic atmosphere in Shanghai has indeed shown a better trend. We have not heard of any student movements, nor have we seen any facts of students making political disturbances. This is certainly the result of the educational authorities' guidance in an invisible way. However, the activity and energy of young people are innate. When a cause for activity disappears, they are likely to find a way out in other areas. As a result, some young people inevitably fall into a kind of distorted phenomenon: 1. An indifferent attitude towards national and social issues; 2. An extreme development of individualism, becoming a selfish and self-interested attitude; 3. Embarking on the path of romance, indulgence, and degeneration.</p>
<p>The first phenomenon can be seen in the exam results of some of the major middle schools. Generally speaking, their understanding of current affairs is relatively poor. The second phenomenon is even more common. Many students study only to obtain a qualification, which they regard as a talisman for their personal future. As for what they learn, what their responsibilities to society and the country are, they do not care about. As for the third phenomenon, it is the development of the above two phenomena. Male and female students go to school with the purpose of finding a "partner." As a result, they are slicked up, perfumed, and dressed in fine clothes. They hang around in school and then go out to spend their time in revelry. Singing halls, dance floors, cinemas, and theaters are places they often frequent. Although it is only a partial phenomenon, the existence of this phenomenon is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>The development of such distorted and bad phenomena in schools may not be visible on the surface, but it is actually a fatal factor for the future of the nation. We dare to boldly say that for the sake of the future of the country and the nation, students who are driven by emotional impulses and often make disturbances are less desirable than the current group of male and female students who do not know how to improve their studies, but only know how to dress up and embark on the road of decadence! Because even if there are any political errors in thought and action, they are still expressing their concern and love for the country and society. If appropriate methods can be used, it is not difficult to guide them to the right track. However, those who are psychologically indifferent to the country and society and only know how to enjoy themselves cannot but be said to be the biggest crisis in education. Today, we do not have any special countermeasures to correct the distorted phenomena, but only seek to first implement the following two points as a test for thorough improvement: 1. All male students in middle schools and universities should have their heads shaved, and they are not allowed to wear suits or gorgeous clothes, and they do not have to wear leather shoes. 2. Female students are not allowed to perm their hair, not allowed to keep long hair, not allowed to apply powder, and their clothes must be simple. Why do we specifically mention these two seemingly minor things? The main thing is to revitalize the new spirit of male and female students. At the same time, it is also the minimum condition necessary to practice wartime life and strictly implement the thrift movement. Because shaving the head can reduce a lot of time for hairdressing and the cost of hair oil. At present, a suit costs thousands of yuan, and a pair of leather shoes costs no less than a thousand yuan, which are all objects of thrift. As for female students not perming their hair and not keeping long hair, it has the same meaning as male students shaving their heads. Not applying powder and simple clothes are not only for strict thrift, but also should be the best expression of the pure and innocent nature of girls, and should be regarded as the most glorious thing. That is what we have always advocated: everything must be considered from a long-term perspective and started from the easy. The above two requirements do not seem too harsh, do they?</p>
<p>Today, another most serious phenomenon in all universities and schools is the hardship of life for teachers and staff at all levels. Mr. Jiang Shoutong, who recently suggested the establishment of a consumer cooperative for teachers and staff, said that the income of university professors now is less than that of a rickshaw puller, and the income of primary school teachers is less than that of an ordinary nanny. Just imagine, teachers who are educating our children and cultivating talents for the country and society are living a life that is even worse than that of rickshaw pullers and nannies. What kind of society is our society? What kind of country is our country? Regarding teachers as less than slaves, and we still want to put the responsibility of "poor educational performance" and "decline of academic atmosphere" entirely on the teachers, it is really unfair! Therefore, any way to improve education and increase efficiency must start with improving the lives of teachers. Only when the lives of teachers are reasonably maintained and the status of teachers is fully guaranteed can we then strictly select teachers and make them bear the sacred responsibility. What is a pity is that, until now, there are only written articles about improving the lives of teachers, and only verbal theories have been heard. There are few facts of salary increases, but in reality, because the ratio to prices is still too far off, it is always useless. Today, we especially hope that the educational authorities will make the greatest efforts to improve the treatment of teachers and staff, so as to stabilize the lives of teachers and staff at all levels. Only when their lives are free of worries can we ask them to do their jobs well. Otherwise, if they cannot eat their fill and cannot support their families, and we ask them to be ambitious and far-sighted every day, frankly speaking, it is absolutely impossible! Many of the poor educational performance and bad student habits in society are blamed on the general teachers and staff. We dare to speak out on their behalf here: if the lives of teachers and staff are worse than that of rickshaw pullers and nannies, then educational performance and youth habits will not improve and be corrected, and the crisis in education cannot be completely eliminated. The educational authorities should pay attention to this.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - Enemy long-range bombers have repeatedly made clumsy moves, attempting to carry out sporadic air raids on Japanese-occupied territories. The Japanese naval air force, therefore, launched a surprise attack on the enemy's long-range bomber bases, Broome and Batchelor airfields in Australia, before dawn on the 23rd, destroying several runways and anti-aircraft artillery positions. All Japanese aircraft have safely returned to base.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from San Francisco, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Command announced on the 22nd that Japanese air force units attacked Darwin Port on the night of the 21st, causing damage to ground facilities.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese and German Fleets Coordinating Operations, German Auxiliary Cruiser Thor Arrives in Japan <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese naval authorities issued a statement at 5 p.m. on the 24th, stating in essence that due to geographical relations between Japan and Germany, they have been focusing on maritime communication to continue cooperating in the war. Currently, they are implementing joint warfare through maritime communication during the war, based on the common interests of Japan and Germany. Currently, the Japanese and German fleets have severely damaged the British and American navies in all sea areas of the world, achieving great war results. The Japanese navy has destroyed many main warships, aircraft carriers, and other major warships of the Anti-Axis forces. The German navy has focused on commercial destruction warfare, also achieving great war results. The number of British and American ships lost in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans is increasing day by day, which is a major blow to the enemy. The current war situation is such that the Anti-Axis forces, unlike in the previous World War, can hardly grasp absolute sea control in any ocean. The threat to their maritime traffic is due to the inability to prevent the Japanese and German navies from exerting their power in distant sea areas. Currently, the German auxiliary cruiser Thor, commanded by Captain Priepl, has safely arrived in Japan after achieving great war results. This has proven the power of the German navy. The ship's crew has received a warm welcome from Japanese officials and civilians and is scheduled to rest in Japan to recover from the fatigue of long voyages. At the same time, they will have the opportunity to learn about Japan and the Japanese people, which will definitely be of great help in preparing for new tasks.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - The German cruiser Thor achieved great war results in the tens of thousands of miles of sea between Japan and Germany and safely arrived in Yokohama in the upper part of October of last year. This has been clarified by the talk of the Japanese Navy Headquarters. The results of its battle are recorded as follows: February 23, Showa 17, sunk the Greek ship Gaspicos; March 20, sunk the British ship Will Pack; April 1, sunk the British ship Will Foyz; April 3, sunk the Norwegian ship Alvasbrook; April 10, sunk the British ship Marc Polo; May 10, intercepted the enemy merchant ship Rankin and sailed to Japan; June 18, intercepted the Norwegian ship Ripple Yang and sailed to Japan; July 3, intercepted the Norwegian ship Matrono and sailed to Japan.</p>

<h3 id="e13">Air Defense Fever in North China <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>With the evolution of the world war situation, air defense has become a necessary measure, and the air of air defense has permeated the whole of Beijing in the past few days. In addition to the important people giving speeches everywhere on the importance of air defense, the North China Permanent Bureau has also ordered a full-scale air defense exercise in North China for eight days starting from September 1. This air defense exercise is different from the past in three points: first, it covers the whole of North China, not just Beijing; second, people from third countries also participate in the exercise in order to adapt to the practice; third, each report, notice, and alarm is attached with the words "exercise" to avoid confusion with a real air raid. On August 19, the Beijing Defense Command also convened representatives of the Beijing Special City Military Police Defense Corps and various special police defense groups to issue the implementation plan for the air defense exercise. According to the implementation matters disclosed in the newspaper, the scale of this air defense exercise is really large.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the aviation observation exhibition that opened in Zhongshan Park on the 19th is also a noteworthy event. The exhibition venue is in the waterside pavilion, which has a total of three rooms. The first room introduces various aircraft patterns, logos, and models. On the wall are hung six posters of American aircraft in Chongqing: North American B25 medium bomber, Curtis P40 fighter jet, Frewster SB fighter, Boeing B17 heavy bomber (i.e. the Flying Fortress), Consolidated B24 heavy bomber, and Lockheed P38 heavy fighter. There are also model aircraft with detailed explanations, giving wartime citizens a lot of knowledge about air combat. The second room introduces the actual situation of aviation sports in Qingdao. Among them, there are two glider aircraft with a scale of one-sixth of the actual size. The third room specifies the usage and power of various air defense weapons. This exhibition only lasts for three days, and will end on the afternoon of the 21st. This is certainly a very meaningful exhibition during the war. From this, we can also see the enthusiasm of the air defense movement in Beijing. (Sent by a student on August 20)</p>
<h3 id="e14">Japanese Army Announces Combined Battle Results for Last Month <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Kyoto City, 24th - The Japanese Expeditionary Force in China's Information Department announced on the 24th: In July, there were a total of 1,764 battles. The combat strength of the Chongqing army was 251,677. The Chongqing army suffered 9,067 fatalities, and 68,563 were captured or surrendered. The Japanese army seized a total of 24 artillery pieces, 6,461 artillery shells, 187 heavy and light machine guns, 175,864 bullets, 4,870 rifles, 166,710 rifle bullets, 703 pistols, 4,663 pistol bullets, 59 grenade launchers and foreign guns, 144 bullets, 9,200 hand grenades, 725 military sabers, and a large amount of other telecommunications equipment, gunpowder, horses, and clothing. The Japanese side suffered minimal damage. The Japanese Army Air Force, after discovering that the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing was attempting to make a move, preemptively bombed their air force bases in Jianzhen, Hengyang, Lingling, Baoqing, Zhijiang, Guilin, and other places, inflicting heavy damage and destroying 47 American aircraft. In addition, the Japanese Air Force units closely cooperated with the Japanese friendly forces in this summer's operations. Furthermore, in the above operations, twelve Japanese aircraft</p>
<p>Comparison of Battle Results</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th - The Japanese Expeditionary Forces on the front lines of mainland China are continuously attacking the Chongqing army in various places, repeatedly achieving great victories. The Information Department of the Chinese Expeditionary Forces announced the combined battle results for July on the 24th. Comparing this with the battle results of July last year, the combat strength of the Chongqing army has decreased by approximately 28,000 men. The number of large artillery pieces seized has decreased by 65, and heavy and light machine guns have decreased by 207. Conversely, the number of captured and surrendered personnel has surged by approximately 6,000. This is sufficient to prove that the Chongqing army's fighting spirit is low and it lacks heavy weapons, leading to a daily decline in combat effectiveness. Furthermore, the number of rifles seized has significantly increased, indicating that the Chongqing army is using rifles to compensate for the lack of artillery. The Chongqing side's worries are also evident. The surge in the number of hand grenades, a major weapon of the Chongqing army, further exposes the lack of artillery raw materials. The number of Japanese fatalities has decreased by 509 compared to July last year, which is sufficient to prove the advancement of Japanese military tactics and the vigorousness of morale.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Hankou, 24th - Japanese army units have established strong positions in the vicinity of Wuhan, preventing the Chongqing army from making any rash moves. They are still braving the scorching heat to continue their punitive expedition. The situation of the Japanese army in this area is recorded as follows: A certain unit of the Japanese army in the Tian Dian area, 16 kilometers northwest of Yingcheng, discovered approximately 500 members of the New Fourth Army on the Xu Dian River bank at 10:30 AM on the 16th. They immediately launched a surprise attack, and after a short battle, the enemy fled westward, abandoning 13 bodies. Furthermore, a certain unit of the Japanese army in the Hao Xue area, 50 kilometers east of the city, urgently attacked Zhang Jinhe City. A certain Japanese unit in the Ci Kou Town area, 24 kilometers northeast of Tongshan, routed approximately 1,000 members of the Chongqing army's 102nd Regiment of the 34th Division and a separate force near Shui Mutou, west of the town, on the morning of the 16th. The Chongqing army abandoned 31 bodies. On the 21st, the National Government army also launched a surprise attack on bandits and guerrillas two kilometers west of Xiao Gan, causing them to flee. The enemy abandoned five bodies, four prisoners, and seized six rifles. Several non-commissioned officers belonging to a guerrilla team in the Song He area surrendered on the 20th in the northwest of Jing Shan, bringing six rifles and two horses. Furthermore, thirteen non-commissioned officers from the 1st Regiment of the Provisional 53rd Division of the enemy army surrendered to the Japanese army in the Shi Chao Gang area, 34 kilometers northeast of Jing Men, on the 14th, bringing one light machine gun, two grenade launchers, and eleven rifles.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 25th - The situation on the central and southern sections of the Eastern Front has entered a new phase after the retreat of German troops from Karkov. According to military experts in London, the German troops in the Kharkov area are gradually retreating westward under the cover of strong rear guard units. At the same time, they are mobilizing reserve troops along the Dnieper River and are about to launch a major counteroffensive. Therefore, the Soviet army must defend against a fierce German attack around the city of Poltava, 80 miles southwest of Kalif. Furthermore, according to a telegram from Moscow, the Soviet troops that bypassed Kharkov and advanced westward have reached the north of Poltava. Furthermore, the Soviet troops southeast of Kharkov have pressed towards the west bank of the Donets and Mius rivers, engaging in fierce battles with German troops southwest of Voroshilovgrad, 170 miles south of Kharkov.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 24th - A special military correspondent for Jinxin News Agency reports: The German army's retreat from Kharkov has greatly shortened and straightened the front line, which is of great help in enhancing the German army's resistance. The German army has encircled two Soviet divisions and two tank units between Simui and Atirga (north of Kharkov). Therefore, the retreat from Kharkov is actually an effect of the divine army weakening the enemy's combat power.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 24th - The German High Command announced on the 23rd: Since the German army launched its summer offensive on the Eastern Front on July 5th of this year, it has destroyed more than 15,300 Soviet tanks.</p>

<h3 id="e18">A Record of the Long March on the First Line of the North Pacific: The Kuril Islands <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>From the Solomon Sea in the south to the Aleutian Islands in the north, in the naval supply war in the North and South Pacific, the transport ship 〇〇 Maru, which had experienced fierce battles, was speeding across the sea with rapid engine sounds. On the blurred mast, the bullet marks, point by point, could be faintly discerned. This was a fresh record of repelling an attack by the enemy's Grumman fighters during the supply war in the south.</p>
<p>Out of Death and Into Life</p>
<p>At the bow and stern of the ship, vigilance against the air and submarines was unceasing. The watchmen, wearing thick fur coats and holding binoculars, stared at the lead-colored horizon, seemingly waiting for someone. The sun showed its face before departure, the sky was a heavy lead-colored cloud, and a white thick fog enveloped the sea surface, reducing the watchmen's field of vision. In addition to wearing a set of cotton outerwear over the shirt, a woolen vest was also put on. All the cold-proof clothing was worn on the body, but the cold air still attacked the whole body from the deck where we stood. The crew members were extremely busy on the deck. Having escaped death several times, they had been tempered and were used to it. If you ask any crew member, they will frankly and unanimously say: "If you are afraid of submarines, afraid of planes, and afraid of the ship sinking, you cannot be on the ship. And coldness is very common on the sea of the North Pacific." Seeing the active situation of the wartime crew, the reporter could not help but bow his head</p>
<p>Flower of the Nation</p>
<p>The dark night spread out, and on the sea where nothing could be seen, the noctiluca emitted a faint light, sometimes bright and sometimes dim. The thick fog gradually attacked the large deck from the left and right. The ship, with all the lights completely controlled, was groping forward on the surface of the North Pacific with only a compass. On the way to a certain place, I floated to the surface and sailed leisurely. If the enemy submarine was discovered by our ship, it would not be spared. By tomorrow, there would be a story of repulsion to tell. But on that night, nothing fresh could be known. Everyone on the ship had this spirit.</p>
<p>"Are we still in dangerous waters?"</p>
<p>"This ship is about to reach its anchorage."</p>
<p>"Too hard!"</p>
<p>"Well, that's the normal thing about sailing on a ship during wartime."</p>
<p>The old captain stared intently at the compass with his mouth wide open, without a second thought. In a corner of the room, a nameless flower of the northern country exuded a rich fragrance, filling the entire room.</p>
<p>Outside, the fierce cold wind was blowing. The thick fog still shrouded the blackboard. The time on the watch was pointing to one o'clock in the morning. The reporter, shrinking into the collar of his coat and standing on the deck, only saw the figure of the sentinel standing upright on the foggy sea. In the howling wind that rang in his ears, he stood upright with a chilling demeanor and continued to watch. We seemed to see a famous painting, and felt a kind of intense excitement in our bodies. Later, in the afternoon several days later, the shining sun dimmed, and we couldn't help but rejoice greatly. To sail the North Sea in midsummer, one must have amazing endurance, a calm state of mind, superb skills, and a strong fighting spirit. And the crew members on the transport ships on the expedition to the North Pacific all possessed all of these, and they also personally experienced a full morale, so they often sincerely thought of the strengths of Japanese sailors.</p>
<p>The Sun Bestows Grace</p>
<p>The fog on the sea was sometimes bright and sometimes dim. On this first line of the northern frontier, seeing a clear blue sky was more joyful to the soldiers than anything else. Sometimes, at one end of that clear sky, the sunlight of the northern country shone directly down in an instant, and the soldiers shouted loudly, too late to take off their raincoats and coats: "The special grace of Mr. Sun." The blossoming flowers of the northern country, each emitting a cold fragrance, and the fog covered the tops of our clothes and coats, and the cold air continued to rush up from under our feet. We were responsible for the important task of building a certain team's base airfield. The brave men of this unit worked tirelessly from dawn to dusk on their daily work in the northern forests. We saw a type of creeping pine that was less than a meter high, with its roots twisted in all directions. It took a lot of effort to remove this root. And in the area where it grew thickly, it was extremely difficult to uproot. In order to open up this northern forest, the brave men valued their sleep and meal times very much. They knew that they must complete the work before the specified date and could not delay it for a few days.</p>
<p>Magnificent Spirit</p>
<p>From morning to dusk, working with all our energy, that is the expression of a severe, endless spirit. In every army, that spirit is extremely strong. In the eyes of these brave men, the harsh conditions of nature were no longer a problem. In front of the temporary dormitory in the misty fog, the brave men ate their cold meals in simple lunch boxes. Their eyes seemed to have tasted the taste, their faces were filled with a strong appetite. During the break after lunch, they picked up the rice grains stuck on the ground with their black hands covered in mud and chewed them carefully. They gathered together in groups of three or five to listen to us talk about things back home. That was a completely pleasant and leisurely scene.</p>
<p>Every day, what we saw and touched was the joyful faces of the brave men, the creeping pine forest, and the lead-colored fog and sky. In the eyes of the brave men at this base, our visit was a very rare consolation. "Ha! I haven't seen the faces of folks from my hometown for several days..." The young sergeant looked back and said like this. "You have worked hard..." These were the words of consolation we could express. "Because I am the captain, when I heard about the suicide attack on Attu Island, I felt heartbroken and angry." "I will not forget the pitiful situation of the brothers who died on Attu Island, and I swear to avenge the brothers..." The soldiers said such determination over and over again.

<p>The Central Police Bureau of the Eighth District specifically notified all Lianbao heads under its jurisdiction yesterday to inform the Baojia heads and Minjing team members under their jurisdiction. The original text is as follows: "After investigation, Lianbao Baojia heads and Minjings often neglect their duties and abandon their posts during their duty hours, which is very inappropriate. Therefore, all Lianbaos are hereby ordered to quickly inform all Baojia heads and Minjing team members under their jurisdiction that from now on, regardless of the time, if there is an incident, all members must mobilize and cooperate in their work. Minjing members must also be serious and punctual in their daily patrols. If they abandon their posts, not only will the Minjing be punished, but the Baojia head will also be held jointly liable for failure to supervise. The penalties are: 1. A fine, 2. Suspension of freedom for fifteen hours, 3. Lockdown (Baojia heads will also be subjected to this)." Furthermore, in view of the fact that returning residents often take their citizen ID cards with them and do not return to Shanghai for a long time, resulting in problems, the Baojia authorities have now specifically stipulated new measures. From now on, if a citizen returns to his hometown without handing over his citizen ID card and the procedures have not been completed within the prescribed time, the Baojia authorities may cancel his household registration once discovered. If it is discovered that the citizen engaged in illegal activities before leaving Shanghai, the head of the household will be held responsible."</p>
<p>Third Police Bureau Stipulates Two Measures</p>
<p>The Third Police Bureau has specifically stipulated two new measures for handling application matters: (1) When various trade associations and other groups convene meetings, they must submit the application to the department three days in advance so that personnel can be sent to provide guidance. (2) When various dramas and puppet troupes begin their performances, the scripts that should be submitted for review must be sent to the department for review together with the application form ten days or one week in advance, in accordance with the regulations, so as not to miss the deadline. It is reported that the new measures have been distributed to the responsible departments for attention and compliance.</p>
<p>Reorganization of the Baojia System Generally Decided</p>
<p>The Baojia of the first and eighth districts of Shanghai Special Municipality originally had guidance committees, but after the two concessions were taken over, the first, third, and second police bureaus established Baojia departments, directly under the jurisdiction of the police bureaus. This reorganization has been discussed several times and has been generally decided. It will be officially implemented on September 1st. Furthermore, it is reported that the Third Police Bureau of the Eighth District has long abolished the organization of the former Baojia guidance department, and the Baojia affairs are handled by the Baojia office, which is temporarily supervised by the administrative department.</p>

<p>In view of the sharp decline in foreign trade and the corresponding decrease in tax revenue since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the customs authorities are changing from levying taxes based on quantity to levying taxes based on value in order to increase tax revenue. At the same time, they are establishing transit tax collection offices in various places. Such offices have been established successively in Nanjing, Wuhu, Ningbo, Jiujiang, Hankou, and other places. It is now learned that the customs authorities are preparing to establish more tax collection offices in Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Hangzhou in order to expand the scope of transit tax collection. It is estimated that the Hangzhou collection office will be established by the middle of next month. The establishment of the Wuxi and Suzhou collection offices is expected to be in October.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Negotiating Methods for the 45th Period of Rice <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The rice sale tickets for the 45th period were still not issued yesterday. However, the Rice Adjustment Committee met the day before yesterday and generally decided on the method of allocating rice for this period. The sale tickets may be issued tomorrow.</p>
<p>Allocated Rice Definitely Sufficient for Distribution</p>
<p>According to intelligence gathered by Datong News Agency, if the Ministry of Food allocates 150,000 bags per month, and the Central China Rice Distribution Office supplies one-third of that amount on schedule, there will definitely be no shortage of household rice, which is distributed in three periods of three liters per period for the first and eighth districts.</p>
<p>Restaurants and Factories Temporarily Reduce Rationing</p>
<p>Due to the stagnation of the state rice transportation organization, the Rice Flour Procurement Section, in order to concentrate the rationing of household rice, has stopped the special rationing of rice to first and second-class restaurants, and is now stopping the rationing of rice to third and fourth-class restaurants. At the same time, the rationing of rice to factories has been reduced from two liters to half a liter. However, the above measures are a temporary expedient.</p>
<p>Illegal Rice Shops Will Be Severely Punished</p>
<p>The local food authorities in this city have recently received repeated reports from various parties stating that a small number of rice shops are engaged in illegal activities. For example, when the authorities allocate half brown rice and half white rice to rice shops, some rice shops hide the white rice and privately sell brown rice instead. When citizens demand white rice, they charge a handling fee under the pretext of whitening the rice, or discount the quantity on each rice ticket. The authorities are currently secretly investigating these small number of illegal rice shops and will severely punish them. They also hope that citizens will report them at any time.</p>

In tonight's events, Bai William, Lu Weijie, Xu Shouqiang, Wang Zhongcheng, and Diao Ganghua are expected to qualify for the finals in the men's 60-yard freestyle. Chen Jingzhong has the best record in the 60-yard breaststroke and has a strong chance of winning the championship in the finals. Wang Zhongcheng and Xu Shouqiang are expected to advance at the same time in the 60-yard butterfly. Who will win the laurels in the future is still uncertain. In the 100-yard, 200-yard, and 800-yard freestyle events, veteran Wen Jingling can always steadily secure a place in the finals. In the women's events, Liu Tianchun and Cheng Jinqian are the best. The finals are scheduled to be held at the Zhangyuan swimming pool on Saturday (the 28th). Tickets for tonight are sold for 10 yuan, limited to 200. In addition, the organizers announced that they hope that the swimmers will report at 6:30 PM to ensure a timely start.</p>

We are grateful for the enthusiastic support of the Shanghai Municipal Sports Association and the full management of the Shanghai Friendship Sports Association. In terms of ticket sales, we are grateful to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce for promoting sales to various industries on our behalf. The charity soccer was purchased by Mr. Pan Sansheng, Mr. Ma Dehong, and Mr. Xia Shikui for the highest price of 220,000 yuan. The players on both sides did not give way to each other, and the match was full of excitement and tension, which was unprecedented. The spectators from all walks of life competed to be the first to watch, and the enthusiasm was unprecedented. We are honored to have Mayor Chen and Minister Chu take time out of their busy schedules to attend the opening kick-off. We heard that Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Mr. Shen Siliang, Mr. Cen Xinshu, Mr. Luo Junqiang, Mr. Zhao Shushu, and Mr. Shao Shidan attended to give guidance. Actresses Hu Feng, Xi Qiuxia, Li Hong, and Chen Juanjuan attended to preside over the auction of the soccer ball, which achieved the highest record. Other aspects, such as the close assistance of the Eighth District authorities and the special convenience provided by the person in charge of the Yiyuan Garden, were also greatly appreciated and deeply honored. In addition to sending separate letters of thanks, I would like to express my sincere gratitude first! In addition, the income from the door tickets is still being calculated. Once the accounts are settled and the funds are collected, a public report will be made."</p>

<p>The Health Cup Invitational Basketball League is scheduled to open this Saturday at the Paramount Ballroom. The organizers have invited seven well-known figures in the sports world, Zhou Jiaqi, Dai Changling, Tan Xingbo, Qian Xucang, Liu Hesheng, Gu Senkang, and Yu Juju, to form a competition committee to handle all matters.

<p>Economic Circle Comments</p>
<h3 id="e42">Purchase, Distribution, and Production <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The basic countermeasure of wartime economy lies in promoting the exchange of materials, which is an unchangeable principle. Materials and finance are like the blood vessels of the human body, which cannot be interrupted for a moment. Any obstruction will lead to disease. Therefore, the economic blood vessels must be checked at all times, and no stagnation is allowed.</p>
<p>Speaking of promoting the exchange of materials, it seems that three key points should be included: 1. Purchase; 2. Distribution; 3. Production; because: after purchase, materials will not remain in the doors of hoarders; after distribution, materials can be shared by all; after production, materials have their source of supply and circulation.</p>
<p>However, it is by no means as easy as ideal to smoothly implement the above three points: for example, since 150,000 of the 194,839 pieces of cotton yarn stored in Shanghai have not been registered, it is known that purchase must prevent concealment and non-reporting; because those who do not smoke cigarettes use cigarette rolling as a way to make money, and those who do not need milk use applying for milk to accompany bayberries and drink coffee, it is known that distribution must prevent fraudulent claims and false reporting; because this year's cotton harvest has increased by 30% compared with last year, and the total harvest can reach 4 million dans, it is known that the raw materials for production cannot be said to be few, and the basic strength of revitalizing industry lies in the greatest possible use of local products; therefore, increasing production in wartime must prevent the shortage of raw materials in factories.</p>
<p>In a word, materials and finance are both the blood vessels of wartime economy, and the most important thing is to be unimpeded and avoid stagnation. This is the responsibility of the government, and it is also the responsibility of the economic circles.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Various Trade Associations Establish Mediation Committees <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Responsible for mediating disputes between peers</p>
<p>The various trade associations in this city, in order to assist the authorities in restoring Shanghai's industry and commerce, have all issued notices to their respective member industries, urging them to buy and sell in accordance with the established regulations and not to overstep the norm and be prosecuted. If they are manufacturing factories, they should distribute the manufactured products to merchants who operate this product. Retailers must sell the existing goods to legitimate users. Do not hoard privately or seek excessive profits.</p>
<p>Request to Dispatch Personnel to Mediate Impartially</p>
<p>Recently, as the authorities have become increasingly strict in their work, general speculative merchants have been severely threatened, and they have gradually lowered the prices of their hoarded goods for sale. Even past black market purchases are not accepted, resulting in repeated disputes and an embarrassing situation. They are now requesting the various trade associations to take into account the welfare of the industry, and to dispatch personnel to mediate impartially, in order to achieve a satisfactory solution.</p>
<p>Establish a Committee to Handle</p>
<p>It is understood that the various trade associations have established "Mediation Committees" separately to take charge. Once they receive a letter from the industry requesting mediation, they will review the various points presented and then notify the relevant member industries to attend the meeting on the specified date for impartial mediation. The agreement reached by the representatives of both parties will be recorded in the mediation record, and the association will issue it for implementation. In addition to the standing committee members of the various trade associations, the committees also hire experienced people in the industry to participate in order to achieve perfection.</p>

<p>Yesterday, while Chinese stocks were wavering amidst uncertainty, they suddenly showed strength in the afternoon. This was mainly because various stocks had already fallen significantly and for a long time, so a rebound was not unexpected. Consequently, trading became more active, and the supply of shares felt tight again. The news of the new capital increase of New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory in the new pharmaceutical industry has gone from prediction to becoming a reality, and buyers have been particularly enthusiastic. The market rose gradually, and there were fewer sellers in the afternoon, with bids very firm. China-France stocks, which initially saw small price adjustments at market price, also exceeded the previous day's price in the afternoon. Five Continents, Sin Yi, Jiu Fu Pharmaceutical, and New Star Pharmaceutical Factory all made progress. The transaction price of Scientific Chemical also increased. The textile industry also stopped falling and started to rise, with Wing On Textile also rebounding strongly. Dafa and Mayer traded around the previous day's price, while Sino-Foreign rose, especially rapidly in the afternoon. Hong Sheng and Da Zhonghua Weaving already had buyers active. Lun Hua, Tian Lun, and Guo Guang also showed a stable trend. In the department store industry, Wing On rose significantly, while Sun Sun, National Goods, and underwear all saw active trading of new shares. King Fook Shirt and Socks also rose significantly, but King Lun still showed little improvement. Da Zhonghua Matches and Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were firm, Sanyou Industrial rose slightly, and Home Industry was slightly lower. In the cultural industry, Commercial Press was strong, while Zhonghua and World continued to soften. Yongxiang Printing, Standard Paper Products, and Jin Feng Paper Manufacturing were all doing well. Among public utilities, the rise and fall of Zhabei Water and Electricity and China Merchants Electric were minimal. Public Electrical Appliances was being sought at the customs, while China Xing Coal Mine was lower, and Hanyeping was higher. Real estate stocks turned from falling to rising, with Lianhua, New Benefit, and Yongxing seeing a sharp increase in bids in the afternoon. Jiu'an Industrial jumped up from flatness, Xiang Sheng and Shanghai Tricycle saw good prices, Kangyuan Canned Food and Jimei Food traded at the original price, and Standard MSG continued to rise, with new stock buyers gradually increasing.</p>

<p>— Jie Ru</p>
<p>It was an early summer morning. Shuying, carrying the letter of introduction that Mrs. Bao had given her yesterday, set off towards this secluded Anhe Temple Road. The bus stopped at the last stop on Xiafei Road, and she walked straight west. The quiet street had very little traffic. The breeze rustled the trees on both sides. She was drawn in by the bronze plaque reading "Moli Shen Residence" at the entrance of No. ××. She felt a tremor in her heart. She felt that knocking on the door of a stranger's house was even more difficult than borrowing money from someone.</p>
<p>The peephole on the iron gate finally opened, and two mysterious black eyeballs filled it.</p>
<p>"Is this the Shen residence?" Shuying asked in a formulaic manner.</p>
<p>"Yes, who are you?"</p>
<p>"My surname is Fang, I'm looking for Mr. Shen."</p>
<p>The iron gate opened, and Shuying was invited into the living room in the west wing. In the center of the hall hung a large portrait, an oil painting of a man in his forties. A round face with two round and small eyes, with a European-style small mustache above his lips. "This is probably the master of the house. I wonder what the two children are like?" Shuying thought.</p>
<p>After a while, two children came down from upstairs. Their curious eyes were fixed on Shuying's face, feeling that she was very kind, and they started playing aside without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Shuying grabbed the hand of a girl and asked:</p>
<p>"Little friend, what is your name?"</p>
<p>"My name is A Jing, he is A Yu."</p>
<p>"Do you like to study?"</p>
<p>The older one shook her head, and the younger one stared blankly at his sister.</p>
<p>"You like to play a lot, right? Can I play with you?"</p>
<p>Shen Shouyi took the letter of introduction and sat on the chair reading it. Mrs. Shen leaned against the door frame, standing as if she was monitoring her husband. After a long while, Shen Shouyi stood up and said leisurely:</p>
<p>"Oh, you are Mr. Fang from ×× Women's Normal University. I have heard of you for a long time. It is really lucky for the two children to be able to receive Mr. Fang's teaching. However, the treatment here is not low. I will tentatively set the tuition fee at four hundred yuan a month, and the hours are from 9:00 in the morning to 6:00 in the evening. What do you think, Mr. Fang?"</p>
<p>Shuying hesitated and pondered for a while, and then said:</p>
<p>"That's fine."</p>
<p>"Then please come tomorrow, the 5th. I will prepare the books and supplies in advance."</p>
<p>"Very good."</p>
<p>At this time, Mrs. Shen had already taken the children inside,</p>
<p>Just as Shuying was about to get up to leave, Shen Shouyi squinted his eyes, peering at Shuying's appearance, and opened the letter in his hand to look at it, saying:</p>
<p>"Mr. Fang is originally from Shaanxi!" "Yes."</p>
<p>"Alone in Shanghai?" "Yes."</p>
<p>"Are you single now?" "Hmm!"</p>
<p>"Then how do you live alone?" "That's why I came to teach."</p>
<p>"Excellent, you are self-reliant, respectable and admirable."</p>
<p>Being a tutor is a difficult thing, but Ying can be considered to have no shortcomings in her work. However, spending all day messing around with them is also a troublesome thing.</p>
<p>One day, Mrs. Shen went out due to an affair. The maid said that Mr. Shen had asked him to go upstairs to discuss matters. Ying nervously took the two children up, with the maid following behind.</p>
<p>"Mr. Shen, what do you want to teach me?" "Um! I have something to discuss with you, please sit! Please sit!" He turned his head to the maid again, "You take the children to buy a bag of chocolates."</p>
<p>Ying knew that this was a trick to lure the tiger away from the mountain. A danger would happen in an instant. Her heart was racing, but her face did not show any fear. She tried hard to make her attitude look natural, with a calm face and closed mouth, like a prisoner awaiting judgment. She was mustering up the courage to resist as she should.</p>
<p>"Please sit, Miss Fang." He said, showing a very graceful expression.</p>
<p>"You can't call me that," she said angrily.</p>
<p>"Okay, then I'll still call you Mr. Fang. Mr. Fang, I see that you are also a smart person. Haven't you thought about your future at all? I really feel sorry for you!"</p>
<p>The fierce desire was burning in his heart, and his face showed an indescribable expression. He was like a beast with temporary impotence, as long as he found a very small opportunity, he would immediately pounce on Shuying and devour him cruelly.</p>
<p>"What are you saying! Shameless thing! You're so old and still so absurd. Your surname is Shen. My surname is Fang. I am your tutor, but unfortunately, it's inappropriate. What does it have to do with you? Please be upright and don't embarrass yourself!"</p>
<p>Shuying said these words as a precaution, shooting them out like arrows, as if scolding a bad child, not leaving him any room to resist.</p>
<p>"Hey! Mr. Fang, what does this mean? Don't misunderstand my good intentions. Since you don't want any development, why get so angry? Besides, we don't owe each other anything now." Seeing that things were not going well, Shouyi quickly tried to justify and defend himself.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, Mrs. Shen called over at this time. When she saw the two of them arguing in the room, she couldn't help but ask suspiciously:</p>
<p>"What are you doing? Where are the children?"</p>
<p>Shuying couldn't help but feel a little embarrassed, while that sly old fox Shen Shouyi laughed loudly and shrugged, saying,</p>
<p>"It's nothing, he wanted to ask me for an advance on his salary, but I didn't agree for a while, so he got angry like this. Haha, what a temper! The children went to buy candy with Xu Ma and will be back soon."</p>
<p>On the evening of the fifth day, Shen Shouyi walked into the living room with a yellow envelope in his hand. As soon as he saw Shuying, he smiled on his face and said, "Mr. Fang, this is your salary for this month, please count it." After speaking, he fell onto the sofa, trying to suck on his pipe as much as possible. Shuying took the envelope and unceremoniously pulled out the letter paper and banknotes inside. He first looked at the note:</p>
<p>"Received from the Shen residence a teaching fee of four hundred yuan, including a midday meal fee of two hundred and fifty yuan. To Mr. Shen Shouyi, receipt, June 5th."</p>
<p>Shuying was stunned when she saw this receipt:</p>
<p>"Ah! Is money also deducted for lunch?"</p>
<p>"Of course, especially with the price of rice being so high now. The contract didn't specify this." "This money, I know, is definitely not enough for you, Mr. Fang. I would also like to help you more, but... benefits and obligations are opposites, right? Haha! If you can agree, I have a way."</p>
<p>Seeing that he was becoming more and more unreasonable, Ying simply turned her back and ignored him. Seeing that she was silent, Shouyi thought she had fallen for it. So he slowly walked behind her, his face even more filled with a hideous triumphant expression. He stood behind Shuying, stretched out his aquiline nose, and tried his best to inhale the fragrance of her hair, and a pair of demonic hands followed the sound of his mouth and wrapped around her body:</p>
<p>"This method is not difficult to implement at all, especially for someone like you who is alone."</p>
<p>"Bah! You inhuman pig!" Shuying suddenly turned around and spat on his face, showing an inviolable expression, angrily breaking free from his hand, and strode back to her room.</p>
<h3 id="e50">The Source of Porridge <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Gong Guangzhao</p>
<p>"Yanchun, Yanchun!"</p>
<p>Yanchun had concentrated on writing his long creation, and when he suddenly heard his wife's cry, he put down his pen and asked softly, "Jinru, do you want to drink boiled water?"</p>
<p>"No. Since I got sick, I haven't eaten a formal meal for two weeks. Today, I feel a little hungry and want to eat some porridge."</p>
<p>"Oh, I'll cook it right away." Yanchun replied quickly.</p>
<p>The bag of rice lay on the ground like its hungry owner. Yanchun knew there was none, but he picked it up to look anyway, as if to reassure himself: "What should I cook for Jinru to eat?" He was simply at a loss.</p>
<p>When Yanchun's wife was sound asleep, he gently opened the wooden box and secretly piled the cotton clothes and coats together like a thief.</p>
<p>A little white cat jumped into the room from the windowsill. The loud noise woke his wife, who was deep in sleep. She stared at the scene in front of her: "Yanchun, what are you doing?"</p>
<p>"The weather is good today, these clothes; I'll take them out to bask in the sun, so they don't get moldy.</p>
<p>"Alas! It's all my fault, I'm sick, and I'm burdening you with cooking, lighting the stove, washing clothes, and all the other trivial things. Yanchun, I really don't know how to thank you."</p>
<p>"Jinru, talking too much will hurt your spirit, you should rest. I'll bring the porridge over in a while." In fact, the pot was still lying coldly on the unlit stove. Where was the rice coming from? Yanchun waited for his wife to close her eyes and rest before taking the package out the door.</p>
<p>The sun shone intensely on the earth, and there were many pedestrians on the road. "What if I run into an acquaintance?" Yanchun fearfully watched every oncoming passerby. It was not easy to reach the Rusheng pawnshop on Xihe Street: "Sir, these clothes."</p>
<p>"Hmm," the gentleman with glasses looked at him and opened the package: "These five pieces of clothing, how much do you want to pawn them for?"</p>
<p>"Two hundred yuan."</p>
<p>"Hehe... what a big mouth, outdated clothes, wanting to pawn them for two hundred yuan, take this, here is one hundred yuan."</p>
<p>Yanchun silently accepted.</p>
<p>On the way back, he exchanged all the money from pawning the clothes for rice.</p>
<p>Yanchun tiptoed into the front room from the kitchen like a mouse. His wife was still sleeping soundly. He coughed on purpose, and his wife stretched lazily and woke up: "Yanchun, is the porridge ready?" He replied: "You're eating it now?" Jinru ate a few mouthfuls, savoring it.</p>
<p>"Maybe your appetite is good, Jinru, eat another bowl, and when you recover, we'll go see the scenery of the summer streets together."</p>
<p>"That way, you can also add to your writing material."</p>
<p>"Ha..."</p>

<p>— Jing Bo</p>
<p>In the deep of night, the lamp is my only companion. I write, it leaves me, never complains about me. Sometimes the wall clock seems impatient and chimes twice, as if saying, "It's getting late, go to sleep soon," but my companion—the lamp—sends me a kind smile on its bright face, giving me a lot of warm voices, increasing my infinite courage, so that I do not feel the loneliness of the night, the terror of the night, the bleakness of the night. Although the snoring from next door continuously transmits into my eardrums. The wind outside the window is roaring, hoo! hoo! I—lonely I—at this time is like drifting on the sea, there is fear, there is sadness, disappointment, discouragement. The emotions of regret flood my heart.</p>
<p>I look up at the dark night outside the window, really, my end is near, this moment of time, it seems as if I will say goodbye to the world forever, the last time, but I occasionally glance back and see my companion lamp full of smiling faces full of radiance, immediately making my eyes clear, the clouds of worry disappear, only feeling that the future is full of hope and vitality,</p>
<p>Seeing that I feel the troubles of life like at the time, it seems like I am shouldering a thousand pounds of burden, making me unable to breathe, my feet are heavy, my head is dizzy, tears blur my eyes, looking at my future is bleak, just a dim sigh, the ruggedness of the road, the hardship of life, plans are like bubbles, hope is like a flower in a mirror, I only see hideous eyes surrounding me, my sweat is flowing, my heart is trembling, the flashing whips are still waving in front of my eyes. I am a decaying fallen flower, and I will be cut down, I curse my birthday, I dare not complain about people's indifference, black clouds are rising, and the shadow of despair has shrouded my life, but I occasionally open my eyes and see my companion's bright face like a lighthouse in the sea of suffering, illuminating me and guiding me to that golden world, lamp ah! You are really my only companion, because you give me an upward inspiration!</p>
