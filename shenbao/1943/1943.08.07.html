<p>社評</p>
<h3>申論物價對策及其機構問題</h3>
<p>連日論述戰時經濟與戰時國民生活，我們已經特別指出，在此嚴重時局之下，厲行戰時經濟政策綱領與整肅戰時國民生活的迫急需要。然而，在這裏，我們還必須鄭重指出，戰時經濟政策之所以未克貫澈，戰時國民生活之所以未見實踐，其主要的阻碍物之一，就是扶搖直上漫無底止的物價問題，由於物價之不能穩定，加深了物資，通貨，國民心理等等不正常發展的程度，增進了投機囤積等惡劣現象，再進而刺激物價的飛躍上漲。交互影響，構成戰時經濟的嚴重危機，國民生活陷於不能安定，無樂業之保障，於是人心浮動，社會畸形，結果在經濟方面是阻碍了戰時經濟政策綱領之實施，在政治方面是破壞了戰時國民生活的嚴肅緊張，棄私奉公，一變而爲「人盡營私」的現象。爲了國家在新時代的責任，爲了民族的光榮，爲了民衆的生存，物價問題，必須立刻獲得合理的解決。</p>
<p>戰時物價之成問題。原是極普遍極平常的事情，任何國家，都不能避免。然而，查考各國戰時物價問題的實際情形，誰也不能不驚異我國物價問題之畸形現象。自二十六年七月以來，如果以民國二十五年的物價爲基準至現在，最低的在數十倍，若干特種物價，更已高升百倍以至數百倍，這種比率，是全世界各國所不易看到的。物價漲潮，雖然始於二十六年八月之時，但其時上昇甚緩，直到三十年七月敵人英美凍結中日資金以前，四五年間，上海物價指數，與內地尤其是重慶政權下各地物價相較，實際上還是比較低下。彼時一般冒險家且曾利用上海的低物價而偷運物資，可爲明證。自三十一年春季以來，初因舊法幣價格的狂跌，上海物價之上漲，始呈瘋狂狀態，去年夏季廢止舊法幣而實行統一幣制，一時把這種瘋狂狀態鎮壓下去。可是，曾幾何時，而狂漲如故，回憶去年秋冬物價，再看目前狀態，不及一年，而恍如隔世。在如此高物價之下，安分良民，且不能不惶惶然企圖稍事購備，投機家則更倚靠物價高漲以爲致富捷徑，人人惟私利是圖，國民經濟與國家政策，所受打擊之嚴重，寗堪設想？</p>
<p>現在上海租界已全部接收，各方面已經着眼於安定物價之對策，亡羊補牢，尚未爲晚，我們竭誠希望當局與有關方面，能够完全在「滅私奉公」，「國策第一」的最高原則之下，改善物價對策，改善統制辦法，完密機構與人選，切實執行法令，認眞的平定物價，保障民生，集中力量，完成國策。在機構方面，昨天大陸新報所提原則，至爲正確。（見今日木報）日本方面，南京大使館，上海大使館事務所，上海總領事館三機關，通力合作，原無問題：而中國方面，租界接收後，自特別市政府至舊工部局的物價管制機構，巳在市長統一的指揮之下，更易集中力量，今日但求上海與中央，及中國與日本間，能够切實協力，微底合作，齊一步驟，前途可卜順利。我們在從前，對於物價問題之日趨嚴重，可以諉諸重慶份子之破壞，可瓜諉諸舊法幣之跌價，可以諉諸租界之特殊條件，現在這種種障礙都已不再存在，當局與有關方面，必能力自振作，有以慰國家及國民的期待了！</p>
<p>但是「前事不忘，後者之師」，我們於竭誠信賴當局之前提下，仍不能不獻言者，第一，是過去物價管制當局，不謂不努力，但結果成績所以未符理想者，就在一般投機囤積者，首先造成了「旣成事實」，然後接受限價，於是形成物價「進二步，退半步」的現象，今後決不容許囤積投機者此種狡猾行爲，澈底消滅此　不合理的漲價現象。第二，我們要重提全面限價的辦法，並與全面的配給制度密切配合，一面對於一般國民日常生活必需品，儘可能全部由配給機關或合作社供給，而不再被逼求之於黑市，一面對於日常生活必需品，及戰時重要物資實行全面統制，使投機囤積行爲失去存在與活躍的根據。第三，就是以有力的事實來穩定幣值，同時對於游資引導於正常途徑，使不得不從投機囤積方面改走協助戰時生產的正路。但是，所有這種積極性建設性的物價對第，今後的成敗，關鍵還在政治之修明。我們始終認定，任何經濟機構，不能解救經濟危機，物價的危象，正是經濟危機的具體表現，所以物價對策要求其確實收效，執法嚴明，主要而先決的還在努力改善政治，愼選賢能，接納民意，不斷求進。我國戰時經濟政策能否實現，戰時國民生活能否實踐，乃至我國復興建設能否達成，直接間接將取決於物價對策之成敗！我們深盼上下一致，中日合力，痛下決心，共求其最後的成功！</p>

<h3>太平洋一年來　日軍綜合戰果　沉毀敵艦艇計二百艘</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　自去年八月七日第一次所羅門海戰以來，迄本月六日止，日大本營發表西南太平洋方面之綜合戰果，計沉毀敵艦艇二百艘（多數上陸用舟艇不在內）；輸送船百二十五艘，墜毀敵機二千八百八十五架，日艦艇沉沒二十艘，負　重傷者三十艘，船舶沉沒四十艘，飛機自炸及朱歸還或負傷者，總計約七百架·日·美兩軍間之損害比率，大體爲四對一。茲錄美軍損害細目如左：　擊沉戰艦六，航空母艦四，巡洋艦四四，驅逐艦一七，潛水艇四，另特務艦一，掃海艇一，魚雷艇十四，哨戒艇四，艦型不明者」。擊毀戰艦四，航空母艦四，巡洋艦九，軀逐艦二十，潛艇五，掃潛艇一，魚雷艇一，哨戒艇一，艦型不明者三。總計二百艘，此外尚沉毀上陸用舟艇甚多。　擊沉船舶百零七艘，擊毀十八艘。　擊落飛機二五八〇架，擊毀三五架。</p>
<h3>義閣及敎廷會議　意義極重大</h3>
<p>西西里防衛能否完遂　爲決定義國命運關鍵</p>
<p>沮利希六日中央社電　義新內閣於五日召開之重大閣議，與四日敎廷舉行之樞密官會議，意義均極重大，其內容殊堪注目，但由義國所發之消息，對此均朱述及，故內容不明。但據當地人士觀測，認爲此項閣議或係爲再確認巴特里奧組閣時所發表之繼續戰爭方針，藉以檢討具體之手段，至此具體之手段成認係强化與德之協方，傾全力以防衛西西里島。再據一部份消息靈通人士稱：此次閣議係爲檢討自某方面致送之通信內容，而與敎廷舉行之樞密官會議有關，但一般之共同見解則認爲：決定今後義大利之運命者，在是否能完遂西西里島之防衛。</p>
<p>義閣通過各案內容</p>
<p>羅馬六日中央社電　義大利內閣，昨日下午五時開會，審核重要講案，由總理巴特里奧主席，命議三小時半，所通過之議案中，有職團部長軍卡迪博士所提，將職團部改名爲工商業及工作部，輔助經濟機關，亦將改名地方會議及經濟局，職國總監則已改名爲工業及工作總監，中央職團機關，調整物價委員會，及自足委員會皆已取消，此項措施目的乃欲抑逼全搏職團會議：中央職團委員會及　團。內閣又根據大衆文化部部長之提議，通過關於約束報紙之計劃，日報及其他定期刊物之發行人及負責編輯人，須取得大衆文化部之許可，此項措施之有效期問，係直至戰爭狀態停止之後三個月爲止，過此時期，則科紙將恢復憲法上自由之基本原則。內閣又宣告其財政政　，爲保確國家之幣制及人民之儲蓄。司法部長亦舉令調整民刑法典，因該項法典之規定，並不符合義團之精神上及司法上之傳統，同時，　因政治上之理由，而將司法年度提前至十月二十九日開始之司法規程第八條，亦被取消。內閣又解散各項法西斯少年組織，並將因政治原因而被流徙之大學教授三人復職。內閣又通過關於公共件嚴及聞學荒地之各項措施，最後內閣又力曾必須將五穀移交與國家，違反此項義務，即等於叛國，決不姑容，</p>
<h3>反軸心軍宣稱　將再襲羅馬</h3>
<p>里斯本六日中央社電　海通社訊：據北非反軸心眾司令部所發表之文告稱：反軸心空軍將再度轟炸羅馬。</p>
<p>羅馬六日中央社電　反軸心飛機星期三又對那不勒斯施行恐怖空襲，死傷三百八十七人，古代敎堂及宮殿或則被毀，或則受重創，計死者五十九人，傷者二百二十八人。</p>
<p>奧萊爾喀大尼亞德軍撤退理由</p>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　德軍五日已自束錢要衝之奧萊爾及四西里戰綫襲衝之喀大尼亞分別撤退，按奧萊爾自蘇軍發動冬季反攻時，德軍曾死守該地，因該地形勢適居東綫德軍陣地之中央之突出部，　德軍當局頃發表此次撤退奧萊爾之經過謂，蘇軍自十月以來，以突擊部　百師，戰車一萬輛之龐大軍力，由三方面進攻奧萊爾，然德軍仍固守該地，對之澈底痛擊，德軍於完全達到消耗敵軍兵力之目的後，始行撤退，衆認德軍戰綫因撤退奧萊爾更為　短，防禦較前更易，同時蘇軍因此次作戰己蒙莫大損失，其攻擊力已被削弱，以其現有實力，絕不能在中部地帶截斷德軍之職絡（至於西西里島方面德軍精鐛部隊，為改守德西戰綫　峽起見，數週來曾死守喀大尼亞，茲以該地已無死守之價値，故德軍主力乃於數日前自該地撤退，僅餘少數部隊作防御之掩護而已。</p>
<h3>美機襲羅國　投定時炸彈</h3>
<p>羅馬尼亞京城六日中央社電　海通社消息：美機星期日轟炸羅馬尼亞油田區時，在數處地方投下定時炸彈及滿載爆炸物之包裹，該爆炸物惹起平　死亡者甚多，民衆受有警告，不可接觸該項擲下物，且於發見時即行報告當局。</p>

<h3>瑞典與芬蘭　簽新商約</h3>
<p>瑞典京城六日中央社電　海通社訊：據外交部所發表之文告稱：七月十六日所成立之瑞典與芬蘭之新商約，現經正式簽字，該兩國本年度下半年之貨物交換，將受此商約管理。</p>

<p>東京六日中央計電　東亞共榮圈內各地學生來日留學者日增，日本有關方面有鑒於此，曾於本年著手整備特別指導方法，現巳大致就緒。各地留日學生之最大問題，厥不日本語學習及宿舍等，滿洲國對留日學生辦法早已完備，在日設有留日學生會館，以爲留日學生寄宿。日水關係當局，爲使中國公私費留學生，便利學習日語，亦特設中日學會，己與中國駐日大使館取得聯絡，並有東亞學校以備中國留日學生習日語而準備入學試騐。至南方各地學生，戰前來日留學者，除泰國人外，為數極少，故採放任態度。惟自大東亞戰爭爆發後。日關係方而及各團體，亦於緊密聯絡下，考慮各項措置，對留學生作有系統之指導。至各學校當局，現均根據明治三十四年文部省所頒佈之外國人留學生特別入學規定，作歡迎招考之準而後，頗獲成績。</p>
<h3>洛勒爾談話</h3>
<p>馬尼拉六日中央社電　菲島獨立準備委員會委員長洛勒爾傷愈出院後，五日在此間招待日菲記者團，據稱：今後唯有爲創造國家，更加努力，不惜任何一切犧牲，以完成菲島獨立之偉業。菲島獨立準備委員會刻正起草　法，可於今年底完成。菲馬建國之根本方針，一如菲鳥革命志士波尼法卓所言，「國家政策之基本在人民之福祉」，故人民之幸福；乃爲一切政策之最高目標，故謀弈島人民之幸福，實爲政府之方針。菲島建國精神，大　可分爲上即道義國家之確立，與大東亞鄰邦之團結，及大東亞共存共榮是也，大東亞共榮圈之確立及共同防衞，均包括在內。今菲島已與日本發生友好關係，已能自物質文明而恢復精神文明，今後教育方針，亦將本此加以改變。菲島獨立基本方針第一爲確立自給自足之經濟，第二爲大束亞各邦協力，第三爲繁榮大東亞。</p>
<h3>瑞典與德國　已成立協定　德軍決停止假道</h3>
<p>瑞典京城六日中央社電　政府昨官式宣布：依據瑞典政府與德國政府所成立之協定，德國在假軍人及德國軍用品，將自八月十五日起停止假道瑞典通過，有一部份火車，則自八月二十日起停止，但普通乘客及貨物用瑞典火車運送者，則不受影響，而救護車之通過，亦將依照海牙公約之規定繼續通行。瑞典無綫電評論此項協定謂，瑞典之意見以爲，此舉可免瑞典之中立政策受人疵議，瑞典之政策，仍以不捲八戰爭爲原則。</p>
<h3>土外長宣稱　決保守中立</h3>
<p>惟義戰局今後發展將左右土耳其態度</p>
<p>斯丹埠六日中央社電　反軸心眾總攻擊之主力，現已顯集中於義國，故如大西洋海岸及巴爾幹半島等，過去曾被認爲展開第二戰綫之地點者、今日其在軍事上之地位，已淪為附屬性質，因此關於巴爾幹上陸作戰中，土耳其之軍事重要性，自將减作戰，乃欲以義國爲基點之側面，因此英，美於展開義國作戰後，同時即對巴爾幹開始政治工作，英·美之對義作戰，若能如願成功，則對巴爾幹各國不出以軍事行動，僅以政治工作，亦不無達成目的之可能，在此悄勢下，土耳其乃仍爲英，美對巴爾幹工作之某地，由此而觀，英·美自將加强利用土耳其，換言之即英·美於開始對義作戰軍事上之重要性，雖已滅低，但另一方面，則在政治上更可表現其重要性。當四西里鳥作戰展開之初，此間消息靈通方面早預料英·美必將利用其有利形勞，加重對土國之脅迫，此自英。美而言，使土國加入自己陣營，乃爲宿望，尤其當此巴爾幹工作已極急迫之時。英。美自更感有把據基地土耳其之必要。由是而觀，英。美對土之將開始作新的　動，不難想象，如倫敦泰晤士報二十八日即曾談及該問題，且公然非難土國在今日情勢中，維特中文之態度，而謂土國應放棄中立加入反軸心方面，大意謂：今日之戰局，對反軸心國極爲有利，吾人常然期望土耳其放棄中立，接近反軸心陣營，但土國竟堅持中立，實出吾人意外。此項論調，亦足以暴露英，美對土國之企圖，故有識人士成認：此爲英，美已對土國展開新外交政策，此外，最近英國駐土大使許閣森，在土京之大事活動，亦可視爲上述外交攻勢前哨戰之一。至於土耳其之反應，據常地軸心外交界所傳，最近土外長曾對某軸心國駐土大使謂。英。美近將壓迫土國，吾人業已察知，然土國之中立政策，決不因最近之新事態。而急遽改變，然當英美決定最後方針以後對付土國時，則左右土國之態度者，厥爲義大利戰局今後之發展，換言之，卽土國之決意，實繫於德國之如何收拾義大利戰局耳。</p>
<p>斯丹埠六日中央社電　土總統日昨復與外長在其夏季官邸會談，關於此次會談，尚無公報發表，惟衆信會談時曾討論土斗其　反軸心國之要求拒絕庇護軸心國領袖人物之答覆。</p>

<p>東京六日中央社電　本月十六日，將有月蝕，如中國。日本·泰國·南方各地，皆能望見。此次月蝕，爲部分蝕云。</p>
<h3>戰時國民生活要諦（二）</h3>
<p>高田：現在日本各部會，都漸次的擴大起來，東京一處的人口，差不多將近要到一千萬。大阪，京都，名古屋，或其他地方的都市，人口都赹大增，但是從反而看來，農村的人口，却是漸趨减少。這種情形之下，所關民族的生活力，大致都被抑制了。這確實是個嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>戶田：不錯，政府也說要維持農村人口到六到成的地步，但是若不大加勢力，恐怕無效吧。</p>
<p>高田：現在巳經到了六成的程度，不過都移到電工業方面去了，換句話來說，都是轉移到都會裏去了。可是總人口一般　說還是增加的。尤其在戰爭之後，人口普通都有增加的趨勢，但農村的人口，不是增加，却是减少。農村人口低落到六成，反之都會的人口却見增加。孩童生產數减少，則日木的將來，決不能樂觀。例如：製造擁有適當規模的農家，這種方案，現在還很有問題。據說增加每家的耕地，以便發家得到寬裕的生活，這大般是昭和六七年時農村恐慌時期所擬定方針。那時農民都處於困難情形之下，每家的耕地而積，雖有一町步光景，但供食尚嫌不夠，至於提高處村生活，减少農村人口，這種考慮，直到現在，還是一個重大的問題。而在另面都會裏卻集合着許多無用的人們，和不勞働的人們。尤其是束京等處，在年齡體格上說來，可以使用於工業的人們，也有相常的數量，如果在這方面澈底地使勞力得以流通，豈不是合理的辦法嗎？</p>
<p>戶田：是的。我覺得最惡劣的是那些受領恩賞的官吏們，都集合在東京，這種情形，委實是亡國的根本了。我從前便主張着，如果他們不回鄉下去，那麼，慇賞的全部可以不發給，這樣，至少他們也得離開束京吧。現在我們舉薩摩軍閥和長州軍閥的事來比較。這兩派軍閥，都是明冶時代復著名的軍人集　現在他們的子孫，在將官階級的人物，從鹿兒島方面出來有幾個？幾乎可說沒有。不用說，在西南一役，那些優秀的人士大概都遭了陣亡，非但如此，那長州軍閥方面，第二代也有將官階級，不到兩代，而人物的稀少情景，也就可觀了。這是什麼緣故呢？薩摩出身的將官階級，都改籍於東京，並不榮歸故鄉，至於長州方面，那情形却大不相同，領到恩賞之後，大概都回了萩，或長府。山口等處，解甲歸農，做老百姓。所以他們的後代，還出了好些個上將或中將呢。這是一個例子，大概現在的中上級將官，多半出身於生活很低的束北或北陸地方。也就是同梯的理由吧。</p>
<p>放棄外表生活</p>
<p>高田：糧食自給自足的問題和訓練，强兵。以及增加人口等等問題，總之，都是農業上的負担。使一個國家堅强，繁榮的基礎，在於農業的興衰。所以對於農業，非改變一般的方法不可。我認爲還要　力尊敬農業，愛護農村，安定農民，以便繁殖人口，確有樹立這種方針的必要。</p>
<p>戶田：總而言之，介紹別人做成的物品，而從中取利，又如拿着別人的腰帶來和別人摔角，諸如此類的心理狀態，如果國民的大部分都抱着這種見解，那就糟了。像這種見解，簡直沒有萬物之靈的價值，這種人的滅亡乃是偉大的人類生理。古來士農工商，商人不位於四民之上，但現在的商人，居然敢在老百姓跟前跨　，這是絕大的誤謬，總之，如果放開眼界，要想發展日本；那麼，農工兩業便是生產專家，和消費的官吏或商人等類權衡起來，不可同日而語！</p>
<p>高田：正當的農民也主張需要農業專家，但在目前的大勢上看來，日本無論如何還得極力發展工業，因此，工業人口也非極力繁確不可。不過若銳離開了農民生活便不成其爲民族，那麼，全體鄧是農業專家，那又成個什麼國體？這並不是集中大工塲於某一地叚，叫他們做那離關土地的生活，是嬰他們一面做工，一面又能時與土地相觀，再進一層的說法，便是農民的家裏。也分設着製造零件的工廠，我認爲將來的日本，應該要團結農工，這是最切要的事，無論如何生活假使離開了土地，便要自取滅亡，那毫不親　糞土肥料的人們，絕對不中用的，赤足踏破大地，兩肩担着肥料，傷游於草野之中，如果不是這樣的國民，那種國家也決不能繁榮的。</p>
<p>戶田：您這話，我很表贊同，搬弄屎尿，那人生觀也要發生變化，氣量也爽快而偉大了。現在我們拿某製鋼工廠的悄形來證明，，這工廠般在鳥羽和神戶鳥羽的工廠，附近的漁村農村，都有人來做勞工，工業做得精緻，所以人們也相常疲倦。但是這裏的工人，完全沒有病痛，害病的都是管理機器的事務人員而已。神戶方面的工人，都是面黃肌瘦，似乎害着　援的樣子。簡直那工廠裏是個病人窩了。什麼原因呢？鳥羽方面的工人，每逢休息的日子，都從事漁業的緣故。國家的興隆，民族的繁　，那關鍵正復相同（譯自七月廿四日廿五日東京每日新聞）</p>

<h3>體育　慶祝接收租界足球義賽圓滿　三省敗於義軍　無名氏十萬元購義球</h3>
<p>球塲盛况空前</p>
<p>本市三省體育會為優祝收囘租界特發起之足球義賽，於昨日下午二時，在逸國球塲舉行最後一　競賽，結果三省後力不濟，以三對一敗於義軍，遂吿功德圓滿。觀衆達萬五千人，爲近年來未有之盛况。　式隆重，首由新聞報董事長吳蘊　行開球禮。</p>
<p>三老主持拍球賽至中途，由問蘭亭袁　登林康侯三老主持的責義球，程志良在播音台上報告球價，結果無名氏以十萬元之高價成交，該數突破上次七萬元之價，創造新紀錄，仁義之風可嘉。</p>
<p>會塲秩序概由第入區一中央特別民警團維持。小　球開始聖瓊先聲奪人，馬亞百步穿揚鵠中網　，三省健兒不甘示弱，金祿生邊　立功，一比一結束上半時。擇地後，三省三　附命。殷　炳牛刀小試，建功而返，好景不常，聖瓊乞格倫立即扳囘一球，成二比一二未久，時間吿終，雙方握手言和。</p>
<p>歷軸　開始，兩隊嚴陣以待，裁判報角起處，三省載　經撥動球兒，浩蕩侵入義軍，羅四爾心血來潮，中途撤回。十三分鐘，三省錄火又起，孫錦順通綫勾中。阿截換個　子戲法，果然有効，　孫越位在先，徒勞心計。十九分鐘，義海軍迆盤那果然不儿，　　命中，紀　途開。斯時三省陣地義軍鐵騎蹂躪，張林根挽救險球不少，使敵終難得　。樣樣時後，三省後方漸吿不支，迪盤那單騎來犯，勢如破竹，如入無人之續，三省又吿失陷。廿七分鐘，義海軍麥契蒂手吻球體罰十二碼球，老孫一蹴命中。在綫塲二分鐘，義　軍維檢拔察陷陣、再度建樹，三省遂以一對三不幸失收。</p>
<p>賽舉該會會長潘三省氏致謝詞，後由銀行公會會長葉扶　給獎。該養全部收入，不除開支，　　捐助申新二教助學金。一幕盛大義賽遂宣吿閉幕。義事　契洛尼</p>

<h3>譯論　物價對策及其機構</h3>
<p>國民致府最　經濟顧問石渡莊太郎氏在日本說：「中國經演界當並問　之物價對債，業已攝定辦法，不久，當可付諸實施。」我們相信物價問題是緊要問題，當屆及各方面正在加以愼重的審　，但為求完美起見，敢　　　之見如次：</p>
<p>物價是經濟情勢之綜合的威集中的衷現。因此，當寄察物價問題及共解決時，必須用綜合的方法。但囘各國之向來的經騐，事實上又未必盡然。其理由之一，在以前的所謂自由生義經濟中，價格及物價，是當作一種自然現象來考察的，所以不成為統制的對象。共理由之二，在以前的經濟學上，物價及價特是分析為物資與通貨二種要素來考察的，不當作一個統一體而研究的。任何國家的經濟機構，主管物資輿主管通貨資金是各別的。綜合二者，在統一的見地來考慮幷計劃寶施的機關，尙少先例。直到各國次第賣施統制經濟後，始相繼設立主管，監視物價的機關，然而在進行上也當被傅統的惰性所窒礙，進一點，此地的現實情况又如何呢？假使有上面所指摘的那種狀態，則應該能置眞正合乎理想的綜合機構。</p>
<p>遺問題就日本方面說來，統制經濟之與日本有關的，南京大使館，上海大使館事務所，及總領事館，在統制物價上，應有何種權限呢？三機關在推進日方各種施策上，大家都知道是共同合作的，但現在當處理華中目前的中心問題，且最需要綜合的施策之物價問題時，我們不禁熱烈希望能獲得優異的綜合成果。上述三機關應以物價問題的解決為當前的責任，決定有充分權限的機構及人事。</p>
<p>問題的中心，也在於中國方面。這裏，新生大上海的經濟統制機關，首先應該加以有機的統一。原有的特別市政府，工部局及公董局，已在陳市長的命令下統一起來，如果物價統制能獲成功，不用說其意義自然極其重大。擁有優秀的組織與入員的舊工部局的統制經濟，在新的條件之下，應百分之百的復活起來。其次，在中國方面，尙存在着上海與南京問關係的問題。這中問的實情如何，其對　又應如何，這裏暫不想加以論及。</p>
<p>最後說到巾日問的調整問題。在中國實施各種政策的責任與創意，自然是中國方而的事，毋須援用所謂新政策。但這種說法，並不是說日本不予以援助與協力。依據新政策的精神，無論在理論上，實踐上，必須對中國有極大的援助。使中日間的合作具體化的制度，有經濟顧問制度，我們組待右渡氏及共他諸顧間，關於解決物價問題，在促進綜合的政策之賢施上，盡其積極的任務。（翔：譯自入月六日大陸新報社論）</p>

<h3>人·情·世·故</h3>
<p>— 趙驤</p>
<p>世事洞明皆學問，</p>
<p>人情練達即文章。</p>
<p>老年人常常批評靑年：「不懂世故人情」。靑年人入世未深，受生活經騐豐富的老人這樣批評，大概無話可說！</p>
<p>然則什麼是「世事」？怎梯才能「洞明」？什麼是「人情」？怎樣才能「練遠」？</p>
<p>所謂「世事」，顯然指的是世問一切之事；而而「世故」，則指的是世間一切事理；「洞明」，則是要有明確的認職。這樣，生活實踐的經騐與接受書本上的知識，就能豐富我們對事物的觀察力，應用唯物辯證法的分析，必然，偶然，矛盾，發展，統一，推測到她必然的結果，於是能下以肯定的決斷，而後何者捨，何者取才有把握。</p>
<p>何謂「人情」？我國俗諺有「不識字可以吃飯，不識人不能吃飯」，「人情」就是能「　人」—認識該人的性格，思想，地位等等，明白人與人之問的關係。構成　社會的細胞的是一個個人，人不能脫離社會而獨立生存，於是不能避免人與人間的交接。因為人心不同各如其面，交後方式就大有硏究價値；何人應親，何人應疏，如何才遠之，如何才近之。</p>
<p>所以，「世事洞明」，就是在造成前進的宇宙觀；「入情練達」，就是在確立正確的人生觀。</p>

<h3>On Price Control Measures and Their Institutional Problems</h3>
<p>For days, we have discussed wartime economics and wartime national life, and we have particularly pointed out the urgent need to rigorously implement wartime economic policies and rectify wartime national life under the current grave circumstances. However, here, we must also solemnly point out that one of the main obstacles to the failure of wartime economic policies to be thoroughly implemented and to the failure of wartime national life to be put into practice is the problem of soaring prices without any end in sight. Because of the inability to stabilize prices, the degree of abnormal development of materials, currency, national psychology, etc., has been deepened, and bad phenomena such as speculation and hoarding have increased, which in turn stimulates the soaring rise of prices. The interaction of these factors constitutes a serious crisis in the wartime economy. National life is plunged into instability, with no guarantee of peaceful work, and thus people's minds are restless and society is deformed. As a result, in the economic sphere, the implementation of wartime economic policies is hindered, and in the political sphere, the solemn tension of wartime national life is destroyed, and the abandonment of selfishness and devotion to public service is transformed into a phenomenon of "everyone seeking private gain." For the sake of the nation's responsibility in the new era, for the glory of the nation, and for the survival of the people, the price problem must be resolved rationally and immediately.</p>
<p>The problem of wartime prices is originally a very common and ordinary thing, and no country can avoid it. However, examining the actual situation of wartime price problems in various countries, no one can fail to be surprised by the deformed phenomenon of our country's price problem. Since July 1937, if the prices of 1936 are taken as the base, the lowest prices have increased dozens of times, and some special prices have risen hundreds or even hundreds of times. This ratio is not easy to see in any country in the world. Although the tide of price increases began in August 1937, the rise was very slow at that time. Until the freezing of Sino-Japanese funds by the enemy in the United States and Britain in July 1941, the price index in Shanghai for four or five years was actually lower compared with the prices in the mainland, especially in the areas under the Chongqing regime. At that time, some adventurers even used the low prices in Shanghai to smuggle goods, which can be used as clear evidence. Since the spring of 1942, Shanghai prices began to rise frantically, initially due to the sharp depreciation of the old legal tender. Last summer, the old legal tender was abolished and a unified currency system was implemented, which temporarily suppressed this frenzy. However, how long did it take before the price rise was as rampant as before? Recalling the prices in the autumn and winter of last year and looking at the current situation, it is like a world away in less than a year. Under such high prices, even law-abiding citizens cannot but panic and try to make some purchases, while speculators rely on the high prices as a shortcut to wealth. Everyone only seeks private gain, and the severity of the blow to the national economy and national policy is beyond imagination.</p>
<p>Now that the Shanghai concessions have been completely taken over, all parties have focused on countermeasures to stabilize prices. It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. We sincerely hope that the authorities and relevant parties can completely improve price control measures, improve control methods, perfect institutions and personnel, earnestly enforce laws and regulations, conscientiously stabilize prices, protect people's livelihood, and concentrate their efforts to complete national policies under the supreme principles of "eliminating selfishness and serving the public" and "national policy first." In terms of institutions, the principles proposed by the Continental News yesterday are very correct. (See today's newspaper) On the Japanese side, there is no problem with the Nanjing Embassy, the Shanghai Embassy Office, and the Shanghai Consulate General working together. On the Chinese side, after the takeover of the concessions, from the Special Municipal Government to the price control agencies of the former Public Works Department, under the unified command of the Mayor, it is easier to concentrate efforts. Today, we only ask that Shanghai and the central government, and China and Japan, can cooperate effectively, cooperate thoroughly, and take unified steps. The future can be expected to be smooth. In the past, the increasingly serious price problem could be attributed to the destruction of Chongqing elements, the depreciation of the old legal tender, and the special conditions of the concessions. Now that these obstacles no longer exist, the authorities and relevant parties must be able to invigorate themselves and live up to the expectations of the country and the people!</p>
<p>However, "forget not the former events, they are teachers for later ones." Under the premise of sincerely trusting the authorities, we still cannot refrain from offering some suggestions. First, the past price control authorities did not spare no effort, but the reason why the results did not meet expectations was that the general speculators and hoarders first created a "fait accompli" and then accepted the price limit, thus forming a phenomenon of prices "advancing two steps and retreating half a step." In the future, such cunning behavior of hoarders and speculators must never be allowed, and this unreasonable price increase phenomenon must be completely eliminated. Second, we want to reiterate the method of comprehensive price limits and closely coordinate it with the comprehensive rationing system. On the one hand, daily necessities for the general public should be supplied as much as possible by rationing agencies or cooperatives, and they should no longer be forced to seek them on the black market. On the other hand, comprehensive control should be implemented for daily necessities and important wartime materials, so that speculative hoarding behaviors lose the basis for existence and activity. Third, we should use strong facts to stabilize the value of the currency, and at the same time guide floating capital to normal channels, so that it has no choice but to change from speculative hoarding to the right path of assisting wartime production. However, the success or failure of all these positive and constructive price control measures in the future still depends on the clarity of politics. We have always believed that no economic institution can solve the economic crisis. The dangerous signs of prices are a concrete manifestation of the economic crisis. Therefore, in order for price control measures to be effective, strict enforcement of laws and regulations, and above all, improving politics, carefully selecting talented people, accepting public opinion, and constantly seeking progress are essential and prerequisite. Whether our country's wartime economic policies can be realized, whether wartime national life can be put into practice, and even whether our country's reconstruction and development can be achieved will directly or indirectly depend on the success or failure of price control measures! We deeply hope that all levels will be united, China and Japan will work together, make a painful determination, and jointly seek its final success!</p>

<h3>The Italian Cabinet and the Vatican Conference Are of Great Significance</h3>
<p>Whether the Defense of Sicily Can Be Completed Is the Key to Determining Italy's Fate</p>
<p>Zurich, 6th (Central News Agency) – The important cabinet meeting held by the new Italian cabinet on the 5th and the consistory meeting held by the Vatican on the 4th are both of great significance. Their content is worthy of attention, but the news from Italy has not mentioned this, so the content is unknown. However, according to local observers, it is believed that this cabinet meeting may be to reconfirm the war continuation policy announced by Badoglio when he formed the cabinet, and to review specific means, and it is recognized that the specific means are to strengthen cooperation with Germany and devote all efforts to defend Sicily. According to some well-informed sources, this cabinet meeting was to review the contents of a communication sent from a certain aspect, and it is related to the consistory meeting held by the Vatican, but the general common view is that the fate of Italy in the future depends on whether the defense of Sicily can be completed.</p>
<p>The Italian Cabinet Passes the Contents of Various Proposals</p>
<p>Rome, 6th (Central News Agency) – The Italian cabinet met at 5 pm yesterday to review important proposals. The meeting was chaired by Prime Minister Badoglio and lasted for three and a half hours. Among the proposals passed was the one proposed by Dr. Jungardi, Minister of Corporations, to rename the Ministry of Corporations as the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Labor, and auxiliary economic institutions will also be renamed local conferences and economic bureaus. The National Corporate Supervisor has been renamed the Director General of Industry and Labor, and the Central Corporate Agency, the Price Adjustment Committee, and the Self-Sufficiency Committee have all been abolished. The purpose of this measure is to suppress the wholehearted corporate conference: the Central Corporate Committee and the regiment. The cabinet also passed a plan to restrict newspapers based on the proposal of the Minister of Popular Culture. The publishers and editors-in-chief of daily newspapers and other periodicals must obtain permission from the Ministry of Popular Culture. The validity period of this measure is until three months after the end of the state of war. After this period, paper will restore the basic principles of freedom in the constitution. The cabinet also declared its fiscal policy to ensure the country's monetary system and people's savings. The Minister of Justice also ordered the adjustment of the civil and criminal codes, because the provisions of the codes do not conform to the spirit and judicial tradition of the Italian groups. At the same time, Article 8 of the judicial regulations, which advanced the judicial year to October 29 for political reasons, was also abolished. The cabinet also disbanded various Fascist youth organizations and reinstated three university professors who had been exiled for political reasons. The cabinet also passed various measures regarding public hardship and literary wasteland. Finally, the cabinet also emphasized that five grains must be handed over to the state, and any violation of this obligation is tantamount to treason and will not be tolerated.</p>
<h3>The Anti-Axis Allies Claim That They Will Attack Rome Again</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) – Reuter reported that the statement issued by the Allied Forces Headquarters in North Africa stated: The Allied Air Force will bomb Rome again.</p>
<p>Rome, 6th (Central News Agency) – Allied aircraft carried out a terrorist air raid on Naples again on Wednesday, killing and wounding 387 people. Ancient churches and palaces were either destroyed or severely damaged. A total of 59 people were killed and 228 injured.</p>
<p>The Reasons for the Retreat of German Troops from Orel and Catania</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) – German troops have withdrawn from Orel, the key point of the Soviet-German front, and Catania, which was attacked on the Sicilian front, on the 5th. According to the fact that Orel was stubbornly defended by the German army when the Soviet army launched its winter counter-offensive, because the terrain was located in the central salient of the German army's position on the Eastern Front. The German authorities recently announced the process of this withdrawal from Orel, saying that since October, the Soviet army had attacked Orel from three aspects with a huge force of 100 divisions and 10,000 tanks. However, the German army still held the area firmly and thoroughly dealt a heavy blow to it. After the German army had fully achieved the purpose of consuming the enemy's forces, it withdrew. It is generally believed that the German front line has become shorter due to the withdrawal from Orel, and the defense is easier than before. At the same time, the Soviet army has suffered great losses in this battle, and its offensive power has been weakened. With its current strength, it can never cut off the German army's contact in the central area (as for the elite German troops on the Sicilian front, in order to change to defend the Messina Strait on the German-West front, they have been stubbornly defending Catania for several weeks. Now that the area has no value to defend, the main force of the German army withdrew from the area a few days ago, leaving only a small number of troops to cover the defense.</p>

<p>Rome, 6th (Central News Agency) – Neutral sources here pointed out that the recent actions taken by Britain and the United States have forced the new Italian government to continue the war and cooperate most closely with the German valve. In the future, German-Italian military cooperation will be closer than before. However, regarding the purpose of the war, the new government is obviously different from the old Fascist authorities, so it will establish a new understanding with Germany.</p>

<h3>The Number of Students Studying in Japan from Various Parts of the Co-Prosperity Sphere Has Increased Greatly</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – The number of students from various parts of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere studying in Japan is increasing day by day. In view of this, Japanese authorities concerned began to prepare special guidance methods this year, and they are now roughly ready. The biggest problems for students studying in Japan from various regions are Japanese language learning and dormitories. Manchuria has long had complete measures for students studying in Japan, and has a student hall in Japan for students studying in Japan to live in. In order to facilitate Chinese public and private students studying in Japan to learn Japanese, the Japanese-Chinese relations authorities have also specially established the Sino-Japanese Society, which has established contact with the Chinese Embassy in Japan, and has an East Asia School to prepare Chinese students studying in Japan to learn Japanese and prepare for entrance examinations. As for students from various southern regions, before the war, there were very few students studying in Japan except for Thais, so a laissez-faire attitude was adopted. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japanese relations authorities and various groups have also been closely linked and have considered various measures to systematically guide students. As for the school authorities, they are now all based on the Special Admission Regulations for Foreign Students promulgated by the Ministry of Education in the 34th year of Meiji, and have welcomed and recruited students in preparation for the examination, which has achieved good results.</p>
<h3>Laurel's Speech</h3>
<p>Manila, 6th (Central News Agency) – After recovering from his injuries and being discharged from the hospital, Laurel, Chairman of the Philippine Island Independence Preparatory Committee, received the Japanese and Philippine press corps here on the 5th. It is said that in the future, they will only work harder to create a country and spare no sacrifice to complete the great cause of Philippine independence. The Philippine Island Independence Preparatory Committee is currently drafting the constitution, which can be completed by the end of this year. The fundamental policy of the Philippine nation-building is the same as what the Philippine revolutionary patriot Bonifacio said, "The basis of national policy lies in the welfare of the people," so the happiness of the people is the highest goal of all policies. Therefore, seeking the happiness of the people of the Yi Island is the policy of the government. The spirit of Philippine nation-building can be roughly divided into the establishment of a moral country, the unity with the neighboring countries of Greater East Asia, and the coexistence and co-prosperity of Greater East Asia. The establishment and common defense of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere are all included. Now that the Philippine Islands have established friendly relations with Japan, they have been able to recover spiritual civilization from material civilization, and the future education policy will also be changed accordingly. The basic policy of Philippine independence is first to establish a self-sufficient economy, second to cooperate with the various states of Greater East Asia, and third to prosper Greater East Asia.</p>
<h3>Sweden and Germany Have Established an Agreement. German Troops Have Decided to Stop Transit.</h3>
<p>Capital of Sweden, 6th (Central News Agency) – The government officially announced yesterday that, according to the agreement established between the Swedish government and the German government, German soldiers and German military supplies will stop passing through Sweden in transit from August 15, and some trains will stop from August 20. However, ordinary passengers and goods transported by Swedish trains will not be affected, and the passage of ambulances will continue to be in accordance with the provisions of the Hague Convention. Swedish radio commented on the agreement, saying that Sweden believes that this move can avoid criticism of Sweden's neutrality policy. Sweden's policy is still based on the principle of not getting involved in the Eight Wars.</p>
<h3>The Turkish Foreign Minister Declares That He Will Maintain Neutrality</h3>
<p>However, the Future Development of the Italian Battlefield Will Affect Turkey's Attitude</p>
<p>Istanbul, 6th (Central News Agency) – The main force of the Allied counter-offensive is now concentrated in Italy. Therefore, places that were previously considered to be launching a second front, such as the Atlantic coast and the Balkan Peninsula, have now been reduced to subordinate military positions. Therefore, in the Balkan landing operation, Turkey's military importance will be reduced. It is to use Italy as the base point. Therefore, after launching the Italian operation, Britain and the United States immediately started political work in the Balkans. If Britain and the United States can succeed in the Italian operation as desired, it is possible to achieve the goal without military action against the Balkan countries, only with political work. Under this quiet situation, Turkey is still a place for Britain and the United States to work in the Balkans. From this point of view, Britain and the United States will strengthen the use of Turkey. In other words, although the military importance of Britain and the United States in starting the war against Italy has decreased, on the other hand, its importance can be expressed more politically. At the beginning of the Fourth Sicilian Bird operation, well-informed sources here predicted that Britain and the United States would take advantage of their favorable situation to increase pressure on Turkey. For Britain and the United States, it has long been hoped that Turkey will join their camp, especially when Balkan work is extremely urgent. Britain and the United States feel the need to have a base in Turkey. From this point of view, it is not difficult to imagine that Britain and the United States will start a new movement against Turkey. For example, the London Times on the 28th mentioned the issue and openly criticized Turkey's attitude of maintaining Chinese in today's situation, saying that Turkey should abandon neutrality and join the anti-Axis side. The general idea is that the current war situation is extremely favorable to the anti-Axis countries, and we naturally expect Turkey to abandon neutrality and approach the anti-Axis camp, but Turkey's insistence on neutrality is beyond our expectations. This argument is enough to expose the intentions of Britain and the United States against Turkey. Therefore, informed people recognize that this is a new diplomatic policy launched by Britain and the United States against Turkey. In addition, the recent major activities of the British Ambassador to Turkey, Hugh Knatchbull-Hugessen, in the Turkish capital can also be regarded as one of the outposts of the above-mentioned diplomatic offensive. As for Turkey's reaction, according to what is spread by the Axis diplomatic circles in Changdi, the Turkish Foreign Minister recently told an Axis Ambassador to Turkey: Britain and the United States will soon put pressure on Turkey, and we have already noticed it. However, Turkey's neutrality policy will not be drastically changed due to the recent new situation. However, when Britain and the United States decide on the final policy to deal with Turkey, the one that will influence Turkey's attitude is the future development of the Italian battlefield. In other words, Turkey's decision depends on how Germany handles the Italian battlefield.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 6th (Central News Agency) – The Turkish President met with the Foreign Minister again at his summer residence yesterday. No public statement has been issued regarding this meeting, but it is generally believed that the meeting discussed Turkey's reply to the anti-Axis countries' request to refuse to protect Axis leaders.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 6th (Central News Agency) – Reuter reported: The Turkish government was busy yesterday discussing the draft reply to the anti-Axis countries' request not to accommodate political prisoners. It is generally believed that Turkey will be based on the principles of international law and the integrity of Turkish sovereignty.</p>

<h3>Severe Punishment for Illegally Transporting Controlled Goods by Train</h3>
<p>Nanjing, June 6th, Central News Agency Dispatch - Recently, prices in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places have been rising, especially for daily necessities. While this is mainly due to speculative merchants taking advantage of the situation, a small number of ignorant people disobeying the law and illegally transporting controlled goods is also a significant factor. Most illegal transportation of controlled goods is done secretly on trains. According to a spokesperson from the Road Police Administration Office of the Ministry of Construction: recently, various railways have discovered many cases of illegal transportation of controlled goods for sale. The goods being transported are mostly daily necessities, such as rice, salt, and matches being transported to Shanghai, and cloth, cigarettes, and soap being transported to Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and other places. The government, in order to adapt to the wartime system and ensure the people's livelihood, has explicitly prohibited the movement of the aforementioned goods. As the office directly responsible for ensuring railway security, we will severely punish those who illegally transport controlled goods on trains.</p>

<h3>Essential Wartime National Life (2)</h3>
<p>Takada: Currently, various ministries and departments in Japan are gradually expanding. The population of Tokyo alone is approaching ten million. The populations of Osaka, Kyoto, Nagoya, and other cities are also increasing significantly. However, conversely, the rural population is gradually decreasing. Under these circumstances, the nation's overall vitality is being suppressed. This is indeed a serious problem.</p>
<p>Toda: That's right. The government also says it wants to maintain the rural population at 60%, but if strong efforts are not made, I am afraid it will be ineffective.</p>
<p>Takada: It is already at the level of 60%, but they have mostly moved to the electrical industry. In other words, they are all moving to the cities. However, the total population is generally still increasing. Especially after the war, the population usually tends to increase, but the rural population is not increasing but decreasing. The rural population has fallen to 60%, while the urban population has increased. If the number of children born decreases, Japan's future cannot be optimistic. For example, creating farmhouses of an appropriate size is still a very problematic plan. It is said that increasing the arable land per household to achieve a prosperous and comfortable life was a policy formulated during the rural panic of Showa 6 and 7. At that time, farmers were in a difficult situation. Although the area of arable land per household was about one cho (approx. 2.45 acres), it was still not enough to provide food. As for improving rural life and reducing the rural population, this consideration is still a major problem. On the other hand, many useless people and non-laboring people are gathering in the cities. Especially in places like Tokyo, in terms of age and physique, there is a considerable number of people who can be used in industry. Wouldn't it be a reasonable solution if labor could be thoroughly circulated in this area?</p>
<p>Toda: Yes. I think the worst thing is that those officials who receive honors are all gathering in Tokyo. This situation is truly the root of national ruin. I have always advocated that if they do not return to their hometowns, then all the honors should not be given. This way, at least they would have to leave Tokyo. Now, let's compare the Satsuma and Choshu military cliques. Both of these military cliques were famous military groups in the Meiji era. Now, how many people of general rank are there among their descendants from Kagoshima? Almost none. Needless to say, those outstanding people probably died in the Seinan War. Not only that, but even in the Choshu military clique, there were generals in the second generation. Before two generations passed, the scarcity of talent became quite noticeable. What is the reason for this? Generals from Satsuma changed their domiciles to Tokyo and did not return to their hometowns in glory. As for Choshu, the situation was very different. After receiving honors, they mostly returned to Hagi, Chofu, or Yamaguchi, retired from the military, and became ordinary people. Therefore, their descendants still produced quite a few generals or lieutenant generals. This is one example. Most of the current middle and upper-level generals come from the impoverished Tohoku or Hokuriku regions. It is probably the same reason.</p>
<p>Abandon External Life</p>
<p>Takada: The problems of food self-sufficiency, training strong soldiers, and increasing the population are all burdens on agriculture. The foundation of a country's strength and prosperity lies in the rise and fall of agriculture. Therefore, it is necessary to change the general methods for agriculture. I believe it is also necessary to vigorously respect agriculture, cherish rural areas, and stabilize farmers to increase the population. It is essential to establish this policy.</p>
<p>Toda: In short, introducing products made by others and profiting from them, or using someone else's belt to wrestle with them - if the majority of the population holds this kind of mindset, that would be terrible. This kind of mindset has no value as the "essence of all things". The extinction of these kinds of people is a great human physiology. In ancient times, the scholar, farmer, artisan, and merchant were ranked in that order, but now merchants dare to swagger in front of ordinary people. This is a great error. In short, if we open our eyes and want to develop Japan, then farmers and artisans are production experts. They cannot be compared to the officials or merchants who are consumers!</p>
<p>Takada: Proper farmers also advocate the need for agricultural experts, but in the current situation, Japan must still vigorously develop industry. Therefore, the industrial population must also be increased. However, if the entire nation is unable to leave rural life and unable to become a nation, then what kind of national system can it be? This does not mean concentrating large factories in a certain place and having them lead lives detached from the land. It means that they can work and still be in touch with the land. To put it further, there should also be factories for manufacturing parts in farmers' homes. I believe that in the future, Japan should unite agriculture and industry. This is the most important thing. In any case, if life is separated from the land, it will lead to self-destruction. People who are not intimately familiar with manure and fertilizer are absolutely useless. Walking barefoot across the earth, carrying fertilizer on one's shoulders, and playing in the fields - if the nation is not like this, then that country can never prosper.</p>
<p>Toda: I agree with what you said. Handling manure changes one's outlook on life, and one's spirit becomes magnanimous and great. Now, let's take the example of a certain steel factory. The factories in Toba and Kobe. In the Toba factory, people from nearby fishing villages and farming villages come to work. The industry is done meticulously, so people are quite tired. However, the workers here have no illnesses. Those who get sick are the administrative staff who manage the machines. The workers in Kobe are sallow and emaciated, seemingly suffering from edema. The factory there is simply a den of patients. What is the reason for this? The workers in Toba engage in fishing on their days off. The key to a country's prosperity and a nation's thriving is exactly the same. (Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, July 24th and 25th)</p>

<h3>Weaver Girl's Letter to the Cowherd, Celebrating the Recovery of the Concessions</h3>
<p>East and West capitals. In the blink of an eye, more than one hundred years have passed. Measuring shadows and observing colors, ministers succumb to the Rong and Di. Envoys almost endured a hundred years of humiliation, but now we have recovered the territory of the nine provinces and the traces of Yu the Great. This is what this concubine has been eagerly anticipating. This concubine is ignorant and lacking in knowledge and experience. However, seeking antiquity and seeking past deeds, the journey was once bumpy and long. Following the agreed-upon laws, there was no choice but to ask the uncles and brothers for help, but they remained silent and lonely. Thus, Zhao's spirit was lost. Taking office and engaging in politics, this concubine always resides in solitude, filled with fear and trepidation. However, worldly affairs are difficult to predict, and we know that changes are inevitable. From now on, I will carefully weave silk and seize every moment. Be diligent in our duties and endeavors. We must know that governance is rooted in agriculture. If perchance there is a disturbance of the mind and a divine epidemic, I will feel that the dark moon truly illuminates. It would not hurt to seek true calligraphy for a portrait and distinguish colors. Of course, change the cap and shift uncertain stars. From now on, let us rejoice and be healthy, and forever maintain auspiciousness and prosperity. Your concubine Weaver Girl bows her head and kowtows again.</p>

<h3>Joint Regular Meeting of Japanese Army and Overseas Authorities</h3>
<p>Held Yesterday</p>
<p>The joint guidance of the Japanese authorities in Shanghai and overseas for Chinese news reporters in this city was held as usual yesterday (the 6th) at 3:00 PM at the Hui Zhong Hotel on the Bund in Nanjing Road. Officials from the Embassy's Shanghai Office, the Information Department, Vice Consul Fukuma, Corporal Shiota from the News Department, and Trustee Akai from the Army News Department attended. They cordially discussed the world's political situation for the past week for a long time, and the meeting concluded after an hour.</p>
<h3>Planning by Various Professional Committees to Procure Raw Materials for Factories Will Unify Distribution for Factory Use in the Future; If Successful, 24-Hour Operation Can Begin Within Two Months</h3>
<p>All factories managed by the Army during the Incident have been gradually returned to our government for management. Among the 140 factories returned, textile factories account for 67. Now that the two concessions in Shanghai have been recovered, the revival and prosperity of Shanghai's factory industry is crucial to the economic construction of Greater Shanghai. A reporter from the Central News Agency recently learned from authoritative sources in Shanghai's industrial circles that since the government announced its participation in the war, in order to implement the wartime economic policy guidelines, adjust economic institutions, and implement autonomous control of materials by commercial organizations, the main focus has been on increasing production, streamlining raw material sources, replenishing the raw material needs of factories, and increasing product output. The flour and wheat professional committee, cotton industry professional committee, oil and grain professional committee, and related factory industry associations under the National Commercial Control Association are all actively procuring production raw materials and unifying distribution. At present, factories throughout the city, such as textile factories, flour mills, oil mills, match factories, silk reeling factories, and other chemical industrial product factories, will gradually begin 24-hour manufacturing and production within the next two months. Therefore, Shanghai's entire industry can restore its normal prosperity of the past.</p>
<h3>The End of the Cigarette Black Market; Vendors Arrested Yesterday, Account Books Checked; Further Private Operations Will Be Prosecuted in Court</h3>
<p>In order to thoroughly eliminate the cigarette black market, the Huazhong Tobacco Distribution Association has instructed all wholesalers and retailers to sell all distributed cigarettes after removing the packaging and to collect all the empty cigarette packs of the distributed cigarettes. At the same time, sales outlets involved in the black market will have their distribution cards revoked and distribution permanently suspended. It is heard that supervisors have been dispatched to cooperate with the police bureaus in each district to crack down on street vendors specializing in selling cigarettes on the black market, and some vendors have already been punished by the bureau. In addition, in order to eliminate the evils of the black market and prevent sales outlets from engaging in malfeasance, spot checks will be carried out on the account books of various wholesalers and retailers to examine whether there is hoarding and participation in black market activities. A Shanghai News reporter learned from the association yesterday that the measures to eliminate the black market this time will advance simultaneously with both curative and fundamental policies. The supervision work is very serious. Violators will be punished according to the contract, and those responsible will be arrested and sent to court for prosecution. It is said that the rampant cigarette black market is caused by general vendors and hoarders competing to purchase at high prices. However, there are suspicions that sales outlets are colluding in fraud. Selling cigarettes after removing the packaging and spot-checking account books are one of the fundamental ways to eliminate the black market.</p>
<h3>Personnel Transferred from the First Police Bureau</h3>
<p>Personnel from the judicial police office of the former Shanghai First Special District Local Court were originally recommended by the former Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department from various police bureaus and appointed by the court. Furthermore, when the former Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department litigated criminal cases, special reporters were sent to the court to record testimony. Currently, the judicial police have been organized into a judicial police corps by the local procuratorate. Therefore, the former judicial police office of the First Special District has been abolished, and the right to prosecute is assumed by the procuratorate. The work of recording testimony is also no longer necessary. In addition, the Legal Department of the former Shanghai Municipal Council has also been closed. Therefore, the personnel from these three departments have been transferred by order of the First Police Bureau. Those transferred to the Criminal Special High Section include clerks Jiang Baoliang and Zhao Shiyu, first-class first-level staff members Liang Bingchao, Yao Jiahuan, Shang Zhaolong, Yang Peiran, Xu Jinwen, and Qian Qiulin, first-class second-level staff members Luo Chuanzhang, Liu Zidang, Li Tongliang, Chen Bingyuan, Yuan Zhaoxin, Gu Qilu, Yao Tingmei, and fifteen others. Those transferred to the General Supervision Office include first-class first-level staff members Zhou Jinlao and Tao Wenrong, first-class second-level staff members Yuan Zhiwu, Xu Siming, and Shao Yukun, second-class staff member Xu Shide, Ni Zhonglin, and third-class staff member Chen Shouchang, and eight others.</p>
<h3>Public Association Section</h3>
<p>Renamed Economic Organizations Management Section</p>
<p>The former Shanghai Municipal Council's Bureau of Material Control had a Public Association Section to strictly manage the various trade associations within the concession. Now that the Public Concession has been taken over, the Police Headquarters has been reorganized into the Shanghai Special Municipality Second District Office, and the Bureau of Material Control has been reorganized into the Economic Affairs Office, responsible for material control and all economic matters.</p>
<p>It is learned that the original Public Association Section will be renamed the Economic Organizations Management Section. As for the position of Section Chief, the former head of the Public Association Section has resigned, and a replacement is being sought, which is expected to be announced within a day.</p>
<p>Public Association Monthly Report</p>
<p>Still Required for Submission; Furthermore, the former Public Association Section stipulated that the dynamics of various industries should be reported once a month for review. The current Economic Affairs Office strictly implements this monthly report, so various industry associations must still submit their monthly reports on time. The deadline for submitting the monthly report for the previous month has already arrived, and various associations and factories should expedite their submission as scheduled to comply with regulations.</p>
<p>Public Association Registration</p>
<p>The Police Bureau Handles It Accordingly; Furthermore, the Shanghai Special Municipality First Inspection Bureau handles the registration of public associations and organizations within the former Police Headquarters according to the original procedures. Therefore, the establishment of various industry associations and social organizations, as well as gatherings, must still be registered with the bureau at No. 01, main building; otherwise, they will be banned.</p>
<h3>Do Not Waste Water and Electricity</h3>
<p>According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency who inquired with parties managing public utilities such as water and electricity, the supply of water and electricity for civilian use has never been restricted. However, in recent years, due to the sharp increase in raw material prices, the departments do not want to increase water and electricity fees excessively to avoid increasing the burden on residents. Therefore, they have no choice but to implement restrictions, i.e., when the prescribed amount is exceeded, the bureau will charge users a higher fee for the exceeded amount of water and electricity. Since the implementation of this method, most users have been able to limit their usage. In order to conserve resources during this extraordinary period, the authorities specifically request all users to save water and electricity as much as possible, even within the prescribed usage limit, and hope that residents will cooperate and not deliberately waste water and electricity.</p>
<h3>Welfare Association Sends Off Major Fujioka</h3>
<p>Major Fujioka Hideo, the head of the Japanese Shanghai Gendarmerie's West Shanghai Team, will soon be honorably transferred away from Shanghai. The Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association believes that Major Fujioka has spared no effort in maintaining the normal citizens of this city during his term of office. In order to express their thoughts on his departure, they held a tea party at the association's new venue on the afternoon of the 6th to send him off. Attendees included the guest of honor, Major Fujioka Hideo, guests Su Chengde, the newly appointed Deputy Director of the First and Third Police Bureaus, as well as Yoshida Tosuke, Li Guohua, and members Ding Fubao, Wang Haibo, Wang Shuxian, Ren Qingshan, He Wuliang, Shen Yiruo, Wu Shaoting, Song Zhuozai, Di Jiuhua, Zhou Xingchu, Zhou Mengbai, Jin Zongcheng, Jin Guanxian, Lin Kanghou, Shao Baosheng, Ai Zhudeng, Tang Zhiliang, Xu Busun, Sun Duanhuang, Chen Shaoyuan, Chen Riping, Cheng Cheng Yin, Chen Bin He, Chen Hongquan, Xu Xiaochu, Xu Guanqun, Xu Jingfu, Zhang Yipeng, Ai Luqing, Xiang Kangxi, Lei Xianzhi, Zhao Jinqing, Wen Guanting, Bao Guochang, Qing Xiang, Chang Nanqun, Gu Kemin, and more than seventy others. Chairman Wen Lanting presided over the meeting. Secretary-General Zhang Yipeng delivered a farewell speech, the gist of which was: "Major Fujioka aims to bring peace and stability to Shanghai and eliminate violence, so that the residents of West Shanghai can live and work in peace and contentment. The members of this association greatly admire him." Major Fujioka then delivered a reply, in addition to expressing his gratitude, stating that he would always remember the help he received from all parties in Shanghai and use it as a compass for his future efforts in Sino-Japanese cooperation. Wen Lanting then successively introduced Su Chengde, Yoshida Tosuke, and Li Guohua, as well as Chen Riping, the newly appointed Director of Economics of the First District, and the people attending the meeting. Afterwards, everyone enjoyed refreshments and chatted happily until 6:30 PM, when the party ended with great pleasure.</p>

<h3>Prosecutors Rotate on Duty During Non-Office Hours</h3>
<p>In Order to Respond Quickly</p>
<p>The Shanghai Local Procuratorate, following the principle of establishing an independent judicial institution in this city, as completed by the Department of Judicial Administration, has announced its establishment. The Chief Prosecutor of the Procuratorate, Chen Zhenjun, believes that the nature of the procuratorate is different from that of the judiciary, and that Shanghai has an emergency situation that should be dealt with at any time. Even during non-office hours, it should be rotated separately in order to provide quick response. Once each prosecutor is on duty, they must not leave their post without permission. In case of leave for urgent matters, they must appoint a person to act as their agent; otherwise, it will be considered dereliction of duty.

As for the subsidized coal for hot water shops north of the Suzhou River, the date of distribution is expected to be officially decided within a few days.

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I recently read an article in your newspaper titled "Unified Rice Distribution in Two Districts by Allied Cooperative," which was drafted by the Guofeng News Agency. The facts are inconsistent with the truth. I would like to clarify as follows:</p>
<p>1. The household rice ration currently distributed in Shanghai is not purchased by our cooperative, and our cooperative is not currently responsible for purchasing.</p>
<p>2. Our cooperative is directly under the jurisdiction of the Food Department and does not belong to the Flour Food Bureau system. However, due to the special circumstances in Shanghai, the Shanghai Food Ration Adjustment Committee has been formed separately. The type of rice and the amount of ration are decided by the Adjustment Committee. Our cooperative follows the orders of the Food Department and the Adjustment Committee. If there are any difficulties, we will ask for instructions separately before making a decision.</p>
<p>3. A considerable amount of food rice has been shipped to Shanghai from various places in the past month, but the figure of 200,000 bags is still only hearsay. How to make an overall plan is a matter for the local and central governments. Our cooperative has not received any explicit orders.</p>
<p>I am writing to request a correction for the public's convenience.</p>

<h3>Sports: Celebrates the Recovery of the Concession with a Successful Charity Football Match. Three Provinces Lost to the Righteous Army. An Anonymous Person Purchased a Charity Ball for 100,000 Yuan.</h3>
<p>The Stadium Was Packed</p>
<p>The charity football match initiated by the Three Provinces Sports Association of this city to celebrate the recovery of the concession held its final match yesterday at 2:00 PM at the Yiguo Stadium. As a result, the Three Provinces team was defeated by the Righteous Army with a score of 3 to 1 due to insufficient strength. The event was successfully completed. The audience reached 15,000 people, which is unprecedented in recent years. The ceremony was grand, and Mr. Wu Yunzi, the chairman of the Xinwenbao, performed the opening kick.</p>
<p>Three Seniors Presided Over the Auction of the Ball. Midway through the match, the auction of the charity ball was presided over by three seniors: Wen Lanting, Yuan, and Deng Lin Kanghou. Cheng Zhiliang reported the price of the ball on the broadcasting stage. As a result, an anonymous person purchased the ball for a high price of 100,000 yuan. This number broke the previous price of 70,000 yuan, creating a new record. The spirit of benevolence is commendable.</p>
<p>The order of the venue was maintained by the 8th District, the Central Special Police Corps. At the beginning of the small match, Saint John took the lead, and Ma Ya shot through the net with a hundred steps. The athletes from the Three Provinces team were not willing to be outdone, and Jin Lusheng made a contribution on the side. The first half ended with a score of 1 to 1. After the choice of venue, the Three Provinces team changed three players. Yin Bing tried his hand and returned with success. The good times did not last long, and Saint John Gegerren immediately pulled back a goal, making it 2 to 1. Before long, time ran out, and the two sides shook hands and made peace.</p>
<p>The historical axis began, and the two teams waited in formation. The referee reported the corner kick, and the Three Provinces team carried the ball and invaded the Righteous Army. Luo Sier had a whim and withdrew halfway. After thirteen minutes, the Three Provinces team launched another attack, and Sun Jinshun made a through pass. A Jie changed his tricks, which was indeed effective, but Sun was offside first, and his efforts were in vain. After nineteen minutes, the Righteous Navy's Dipan Na was indeed extraordinary, and scored, and Ji Tu opened the score. At this time, the Three Provinces team's position was ravaged by the iron cavalry of the Righteous Army. Zhang Lingen saved many dangerous balls, making it difficult for the enemy to score. After the sample time, the Three Provinces rear gradually became unsustainable, and Dipan Na committed a single ride, with the momentum of breaking bamboo, as if entering no man's land. The Three Provinces team lost ground again. After twenty-seven minutes, the Righteous Navy's Machiti hand-kissed the ball and was penalized with a twelve-yard kick. Old Sun hit the ball with one kick. In the two minutes of the line field, the Righteous Army's Wei Jian Ba Cha broke into the formation and made another achievement. The Three Provinces team unfortunately lost with a score of 1 to 3.</p>
<p>At the match, the president of the association, Pan Sanxing, gave a thank you speech, and then the president of the Banking Association, Ye Fuzhi, presented the awards. All the income from the event, excluding expenses, will be donated to the Shengxin Second Education Scholarship. A grand charity event was then announced to be closed. Righteous events Keloni</p>

<h3>Respectfully Thank All Parties for Supporting the Charity Event. Mr. Pan's Enthusiasm and Perseverance are Engraved in Our Hearts.</h3>
<p>The conference has now come to a successful conclusion. This newspaper and the Xinwenbao's scholarship fund have always received the care and support of all sectors of society, which is worthy of gratitude. And this time, the Three Provinces Sports Association, led by Mr. Pan Sanxing, took the lead in commemorating the recovery of the concession, demonstrating righteousness and hosting this grand charity event, with passionate support, which made this newspaper feel grateful. During the event, we were honored by the support of the Minister of Education, Minister Ding, Governor Li, Mayor Chen, and other officials, as well as the ambassadors of France and Italy, the military attachés stationed in Shanghai, Ambassador Wu Kaisheng, Mr. Cheng Zhiliang, Mr. Li Zeyi, etc. Li Songling, the generosity of the anonymous donation for the ball, the enthusiastic support of all sectors of society, Chen Zhongjun's cooperative efforts, and the free use of the venue by the owner of Yiguo, and the assistance of the Donghua Liaison and the two sports associations, either donating the printing of special publications or donating charity balls, are all deeply appreciated. Taking advantage of the grand closing of the conference, I would like to add a few words to express my gratitude.</p>
<h3>Translation and Discussion: Price Control Measures and Their Institutions</h3>
<p>Mr. Shotaro Ishiwatari, the top economic advisor to the National Government, said in Japan, "The Chinese economic circles are also asking about the price debt issue, and a method has been set, which will be implemented soon." We believe that the price issue is an important issue, and all parties concerned are giving it careful consideration. However, in order to achieve perfection, we dare to offer the following opinions:</p>
<p>Prices are a comprehensive and concentrated expression of the economic situation. Therefore, when observing and solving the price problem, a comprehensive approach must be used. However, the past experience of various countries is not necessarily the case. One of the reasons is that in the previous so-called free economy, prices and prices were regarded as a natural phenomenon and therefore not subject to control. The second reason is that in previous economics, prices and price characteristics were analyzed into two elements: materials and currency, and were not studied as a unified whole. The economic institutions of any country are separate for those in charge of materials and those in charge of currency funds. There are few precedents for institutions that integrate the two and consider and plan the implementation from a unified perspective. It was not until countries gradually implemented controlled economies that they successively established competent agencies to monitor prices. However, the progress was also hindered by traditional inertia. What is the reality here? If there is the kind of situation pointed out above, then a truly ideal comprehensive institution should be established.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue from the Japanese perspective, what authority should the Nanjing Embassy, the Shanghai Embassy Office, and the Consulate General have in controlling prices in relation to Japan's controlled economy? Everyone knows that the three agencies are cooperating to promote various Japanese policies, but now when dealing with the current central issue in Central China and the most needed comprehensive price policy issue, we cannot help but eagerly hope to obtain excellent comprehensive results. The above three agencies should take the solution of the price problem as their current responsibility and decide on an agency and personnel with full authority.</p>
<p>The core of the problem also lies in China. Here, the economic control mechanism of the new Greater Shanghai should first be organically unified. The original Special Municipal Government, the Ministry of Industry and the Bureau of Public Works have been unified under the command of Mayor Chen. If price control is successful, its significance is naturally extremely important. The controlled economy of the former Bureau of Public Works, with its excellent organization and personnel, should be 100% revived under the new conditions. Secondly, in China, there is still the issue of the relationship between Shanghai and Nanjing. What is the truth in this question and how should it be dealt with? I don’t want to discuss it here for the time being.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s talk about the adjustment between China and Japan. The responsibility and creativity for implementing various policies in China is naturally a matter for China, and there is no need to invoke the so-called new policy. However, this statement does not mean that Japan will not provide assistance and cooperation. In accordance with the spirit of the new policy, China must be given great assistance in theory and practice. The economic advisory system is a system that embodies the cooperation between China and Japan. We look forward to Ishiwatari and other consultants fulfilling their active tasks in promoting the implementation of comprehensive policies on solving the price problem.

<h3>People, Relationships, and the World</h3>
<p>— Zhao Xiang</p>
<p>Understanding the world is all learning,</p>
<p>Mastering relationships is the best writing.</p>
<p>Older people often criticize young people: "They don't understand the ways of the world." Young people haven't been in the world long, so they probably have nothing to say when criticized like this by older people who have more life experience!</p>
<p>So what is "the world"? How can one "understand" it? What are "relationships"? How can one "master" them?</p>
<p>The so-called "world" clearly refers to everything in the world; while "worldliness" refers to the principles of everything in the world; "understanding" means having a clear understanding. In this way, practical experience in life and accepting knowledge from books can enrich our ability to observe things. Applying the analysis of dialectical materialism, the inevitable, the accidental, the contradiction, the development, the unity, we can speculate on her inevitable results, and then we can have the confidence to decide what to discard and what to take.</p>
<p>What are "relationships"? There is a saying in our country: "You can eat if you don't know how to read, but you can't eat if you don't know people." "Relationships" means being able to "know people"—to understand their personality, thoughts, status, etc., and to understand the relationship between people. The cells that make up society are individual people, and people cannot exist independently of society, so they cannot avoid interacting with each other. Because people's hearts are different, just like their faces, there is great value in studying the way they interact; who should be close, who should be distant, how to be distant, how to be close.</p>
<p>Therefore, "understanding the world" means creating an advanced worldview; "mastering relationships" means establishing a correct outlook on life.</p>
<h3>Eating Tomatoes</h3>
<p>— Wang Shuai'ai</p>
<p>Tomatoes, the name comes from the transliteration of "Tomato". I don't know if they are imported goods, but now they are also commonly sold on the market. In the window of the fruit store, on the stall in the vegetable market, and sometimes in the basket hanging from the girls, you can see many bright red, shiny cloths. The plump appearance is already endearing, not to mention that the taste is delicious and the price is relatively cheap, the good ones are about three yuan a catty.</p>
<p>Maybe you can say that both are fine! Both ripe and raw are delicious. For raw ones, you can pick out the complete ones, wash them with soap, and then rinse them with cold boiled water or hot water. If you want to be more particular, you can soak them in a diluted solution of potassium permanganate in cold boiled water. It is easier to avoid losing vitamin C with cold boiled water, and hot boiled water does not lose much vitamin either. And it makes the skin easier to peel off. After peeling it off, you can make a small hole on it, pour in a little white sugar, stir it gently with chopsticks, and wait for half an hour before eating it. That's really delicious. It's best to put it in an ice cabinet, or you can cut it into thin slices and soak it in sugar juice. If you prefer to use refined salt instead of white sugar, that's also fine, it has a special flavor.</p>
<h3>Introduction: Introducing the Art of Mr. Yamagishi, a Famous Japanese Print Artist</h3>
<p>Japanese print artist, Keiki Yamagishi, was born in 1892. In his twenties, he emerged in the domestic art scene, becoming a founding member of the Japanese Print Service Association. In the Taisho 15th year (1926), the Ministry of Education commissioned him to investigate prints in European and American countries. During the three wars at that time, his footprints reached fifteen countries. Art academies and museums in various countries competed to solicit his works for preservation.</p>
<p>In 1928, he taught in the United States at the age of only thirty-six. Originally, he was scheduled to give lectures for only a few months before returning to his country, but due to the strong retention of students, he stayed for as long as two years. In 1937, his masterpiece "One Hundred Views of the World" was completed, and his reputation grew. In the centenary year (of Japan), he began to produce "One Hundred Views of Greater East Asia." He went through hardships, entering and exiting gunfire to create on-site sketches, which shows his dedication to art. In April 1939, he was commissioned by the Naval Department to create a painting of the American warship Australia entering Yokohama Harbor. From November of the same year to March of the following year, he went to the front lines of Central and Southern China as a war artist, during which his works were abundant.</p>
<p>His two masterpieces, "One Hundred Views of the World" and "One Hundred Views of Greater East Asia," were exhibited at the Shanghai Gallery last year and received excellent reviews. Once transportation becomes smooth, he is preparing to travel to the Southern Hemisphere for sketching trips.</p>
<p>In addition to prints, he also excels in oil paintings. In Taisho 7 (1918), the Japanese Empress purchased and stored his work in the Imperial Palace. His print was presented to the Japanese Emperor on the day of his marriage, which was praised and accepted. Mr. Yamagishi has contributed the most to the glorious position of Japanese prints in the world art scene. Mr. Yamagishi has already arrived in Shanghai and will go north to Beijing Normal University in early September to teach. The northern art scene will show vigorous vitality, which can be predicted.</p>

<h3>Elementary School In-Service Training Association to Hold Concert Tonight</h3>
<p>Location: YMCA Auditorium Time: 7:30 PM to 9:00 PM Tonight</p>
<p>The elementary school teachers' summer in-service training association, sponsored by this newspaper, has been proceeding smoothly since its opening on the 15th of last month. Now, in order to celebrate the recovery of the concessions and promote music education, the association has specifically scheduled a concert for tonight (the 7th) at 7:30 PM in the YMCA Auditorium in Baxianqiao. There will also be a friendly gathering with the Huayuan University. Sun Xiangzhong, Lu Buru, Li Zhenbang, and others will lecture on the Eight Virtues, and President Chen will deliver a speech. In terms of programs, Mr. Shi Renwang will perform a harmonica solo, Mr. Wei Zhongle will perform the 冈乐, and there will be a female solo, which are quite wonderful. Elementary school colleagues in this city can collect tickets at the YMCA for Women at No. 63 Weihaiwei Road from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM today.</p>
<p>The in-service training association also recognizes that the health of elementary school colleagues is a problem, so it is holding a health check. It has now contacted the Chinese Health Company on the third floor of No. 996 Jing'an Temple Road, and the examination will begin today in installments. Those who have registered to participate are very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Lost and Found Disposal Method</h3>
<p>(Letter) I lost a gold watch in a tram a few months ago. Fortunately, it was found by passenger Xu Zaikang, who handed it over to ticket clerk No. 1031, who transferred it to the tram company for safekeeping. In the meantime, it was also advertised in the social services section of your newspaper. After seeing the report, I immediately went to the tram company on Suzhou Road to inquire, but unexpectedly, the company used the same excuse, delaying in every possible way. Despite months of verbal or written negotiations, I have not been able to get any results, and they have not even given a word of reply. Therefore, I advise all ladies and gentlemen that if you find any lost items in the tram, you can submit them to the social service department of this newspaper or the nearest police station for collection. Do not hand them over to the tram company again to avoid misappropriation. Sincerely, Zhuo Anhua.</p>
<p>Sage Learning Lecture, 4 PM on the 8th.</p>
<p>The Chinese Confucian Society will hold an induction lecture at the Shanghai Women's Middle School on Xin Dagu Road. Lin Kanghou, Zhang Yi, Chen Yaochu, Sun Xiangzhong, Wang Shifu, Yang Zhongyi, and other celebrities are invited to speak. All sectors are welcome to attend. Admission is free, and no donations will be solicited.</p>
<p>The Yuqi Scholarship Committee previously entrusted various schools to handle student scholarship matters. The schools have successively sent them, and the committee has reviewed and approved a total of seventy-six students.</p>
<p>Acknowledgments: Yesterday, Mr. Xiong Rensheng and Yu Yinming each donated 50 yuan to the Yushi Nursing Home for the Elderly, and Laywoman Luo Huizhao donated ten yuan. We hereby express our gratitude.</p>
<h3>Visit to the Bosco Children's Home (II)</h3>
<p>The Work of the Bosco Children's Home</p>
<p>The Catholic Charity Association, whose full name is "Catholic St. John Bosco Children's Home," is also called the Salesian Society because its patron saint is St. Francis de Sales. It specializes in using charitable methods to educate poor teenagers. Its emergence was due to the kindness and efforts of St. John Bosco, but its historical background cannot be ignored. After the Industrial Revolution in Europe, capitalism advanced sharply in Europe and America. Tens of thousands of poor people were swept into various factories, abandoning their children and unable to care for them. These children idled, played, stole, scolded, and harmed each other in the dirty streets of the slums. The degradation of the children themselves and the losses to society and the country were unbearable to contemplate. Therefore, St. John Bosco's establishment of education programs for vagrant and poor children met the needs of the times.</p>
<p>The Bosco Children's Home organizes the following activities: (1) Using play methods to gather children who are wandering in the streets, using good treatment to teach them basic knowledge. This is the current "Celebration Hospital" (慶禮院) enterprise of the association. (2) Gathering child laborers in general factories every night and on holidays, teaching them a little knowledge and etiquette, which is today's night school and holiday school. (3) For children without parents, homes, or jobs, boarding schools are established to accommodate and educate them. In addition to general knowledge, they are taught craftsmanship skills. This has become the later vocational school, so that children can support themselves after learning a skill, start a family, and become productive members of society and the country; (4) In accordance with the needs of various countries and regions, cultivate scientifically trained agricultural and industrial children for the country, and open ordinary primary schools, higher primary schools, and middle schools to cultivate talents preparing for advanced studies.</p>
