<h3 id="c1">日本强化國內態勢與中國 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>日本政府鑒於當前世界戰局日趨緊張，為國確立必勝態勢，以保持東亞永久和平，會於上月間，研究強化國政運營的方針，在九月二十一日閣議中，經過七小時之久的審議，通過了國政運營大鋼。九月二十八日閣議，更為實現國內體制強化化方策，而決定：　召開　時閣議；　設立軍許省。在此兩大重要決議之間，塹有汪主腐赴日興日本局推　　談之事，這是最近東亞時事中最值得重親的新發展。　　最近日本政府決定的強化國內態勢方針的內容，據日本情報局發表的公告，此次日本強化國內態勢之目標：為（甲）使民間透澈了解皮次戰爭之意義，并使覺悟其完成之非易，決抱必勝之信念，就披瀝不屈不撓忠報國之赤誠。（益）傾注國力，以期急速增強需生產，尤着軍於航空戰力之據充。（丙）確立日滿兩國食糧之絕對自給態勞。（丁）強化國內防御。由此可見日本這次劃時期的決定，完全是鑒於世界戰爭的新　　而採取集中國力的方策，以便保必勝的地位。再看強化國內態勢方策的內容，便更可明瞭：</p>
<p>第一，是實現行致通營的決戰態勢，其主要和具體方針是：　致務報行之澈底迅速化；　預算之澈底單純化；　官署事務之澈底簡素化；整理行政機　，再度減行政人員;　能之運營絕不間斷。這種出戰行政方針，和我們一向所請求我政府「實行簡政」及「提高行政效事」，若合符節，希望在各級政府之間，造成嚴嚴肅和活　的新風氣，不浪費人力。　力，國努興時間，實為克服時困　。修明政治。強化政府威信興行政效率的前提，今友邦已李先邁進，吾國不宜落後。此吾所應自勉者一也。</p>
<p>第二，日本此次強化國內態勢的政策，同時特別注重於國民動員之澈底化，其具體方針是：　停止一般微兵晨煖辦法，除對於　工科系的學生，秀設入營延期制，整頓　充理一科系的學校之外，并對法律文學科系的大學專門學校實行統合整理。　據大微用的范圍，特殊救得者以外，原　免之列者，茲亦予以徹廢。　加強女子動員。　迅速實施　當的工作分配。　廢除各業中之停工年齡限制，儘量使用年齡較高者。　在綜合計劃之下，把所節約的人力，用就參興戰爭的遂行上。　繼續義務教育八年詞。以上各種新方針，全在貫澈國民動員以集中國力於戰爭方面。在人力方面，則擴做成號召范圍，規定十七種職業和戰爭直接關係者，或可由恨子但任者，限制十四歲至四十歲的男子就職。因此即有廣大職業領域，可動女子來擔負工作，使男子擔任興漳州有直接關係的事業。此鐘徹底動員辦法，自為今日總力決戰中的勝利要素之一。反觀我國，國力之散漫如故，能不急起直進，以負「共保東亞」的神聖職務？此吾人所應自勉者二也。</p>
<p>第三，爲了澈底强化國內防衛態勢，決定採用的方針是：　實現國內防衛行政運營之統一。　對於國家重要地區，軍事及軍事上重要工廠礦山等，極力加強防空力。決定由官方首先實行，並令各公共團體·各種統制機關·統制公司等，依照官署辦法實行必要的整理。　實行官署及其他機構與人員向各地疏散的綜合計劃。　促進民間之企業整備，依官署整理辦法使東京及重要都市之民房店鋪實行整理。所有這種方針，自然都是針對美英方面所謂「太平洋反攻」的新陰謀而施行的必要的準備「反攻」的計劃之中，顯然包括以中國領土及領空爲戰塲的陰謀，所以我們對於重要城市·工廠·礦山·官署·學校及民房的防衛防空各項準備，亦不能不求其萬全，特別如上海一隅，集中人民至五百萬以上，實非決戰時期所應有的現象，在萬一之際，即易釀成無謂的損失與食糧治安等問題，所以必要的疏散工作，還有加以攷慮實施的必要。此吾人所應自勉者三也。</p>
<p>此次日本強化內態勢具體辦法中，貫澈於政治事經濟文化各部門，除上述者外，主要者尙有下列各項：　為求重要企業在經營上更明確表現國家性起見資金集中於戰力，偉務，并減縮其人員。而貫敵於此次強化國內態勢之重心，則為統師興國務之緊密化，由此而舉官民合作之全力，以必勝之信念，共謀軍需生產特別是航空生產之急速的增強。這種加強官民合作，集中國家　力，加強生產，增進戰力的辦法，都值得我們上下一致研究實現。此吾人所應自勉者四也。</p>
<p>為了集中國力增強生產，　充航空，日本閣議又於九月二十八日決定取消商工省及企業院而創設軍需省。同日日本閣議決定在十月二十五日起召集　時會議，提出關於現情勢下有　國政運營之法律案及預算等，經過議會面向國內外表明政府完遂戰爭之決心，并程高國民必勝信念，強化國民之團結。預定通過為增進戰力必要的預算案之外，法案中包括：開於預算備化者，關於司法簡化者，關於軍需公司者，關於強化防空者，關於議員之職務者，及已日益　烈，戰局之前途，乃　益　　。」「我一億國民，尤應一新其決意，當以斷然之勇氣，舉其總力，集中於戰爭之完專門研究。蓋際此危急之時，一致舊盡忠，實意我國必勝之根源。」實際上這不僅為日本一億國民的責任，也正是東亞十億國民共同的責任。</p>
<p>在此日本強化國內態勢之際，我國汪主席之訪問日本，谷大使及蔡大使之往來東京南京之間，對於今後中日關係之更進一步的強化，對於中日兩國總力作戰的推進，我們深信必有重大的發展。但是，取得有利地位的因素，這在求政治的上軌道，還在淾對於人民生活的改善，進遙促進國力之集中，才能擔負起我們的使命，興日本具國一致努力相配合，共同確保東亞民族之解放興太平洋上的永久和平。</p>

<h3 id="c2">日强化行政機　具體方案起草中　决設農商及運輸通信兩省 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>

<p>東京二日中央社電日情報局二日下午五時三十分發表：（甲）設置農商省事宜，　日政府為確立日滿兩國糧食自給態勢，確保國民生活物資，以期安定戰時國民生活起見，決定將前商工省所轄事項中與軍需關係較輕者（交易除外），移歸農林者管轄，　政正農林省機構，農林省改稱農商省，　與交易有關事項移交大東亞省管理，　農林省機檔之改定，定十一月一日起實施，刻正由有關官廳從速準備。（乙）設置運輸通信省事宜，　日政府為根據常前情勢下之國政運營要綱。從速海陸之粽合運輸，謀發揮戰時通信力，故設立運輸通信者。而取消鐵道省及遞信省，　運輸通信省係以鐵道省及遞信省為基幹而構成，掌管海陸綜合運輸及與此有關之事項以及有關通信之事項，　為完成上述目的起見，將海關倉庫港灣土木港務等港灣，行政汽輸行政等以及運輸上必要之事項，而由他省管　者移交運輪通信省管理，　採取使陸海軍現役武宮為運輸通信省職員之措置，　當擬定運輪通信省機構之計劉時。應以其組織之節索有力為主要目標，其間更應沖意勿使其能率减低，　運輸通信省定十一月一日開始辦公，刻正由有關官廳從速準備。（備考）　關於中日滿三國問之梅陸運輸，決定採取足以能一貫運用之措置·　過去遞信省所轄關於電力之事項，應移交軍需省管理。</p>

<p>柏林二日中央社電　德軍當局一日宣稱：近日來東綫有數地之德軍抵抗力逐日增强，尤於聶伯河下游之薩波洛齊及梅里托波爾兩地中問地區，德車之反攻極為熾烈，該方面之蘇軍五日前即已增强攻擊力，九月三十日更出動新銳兵力，以步兵十五師團，坦克車旅團及多數砲兵部隊等三軍團大兵力，企圖突破　波洛齊及梅里托波爾中間約百十八公里之德軍陣地，然經德軍運續數次强烈之防禦戰，已將共擊退。蘚軍曾出動坦克車二百五十輛，被擊毀達百四十輛，德軍於該方面抵抗力之增强，乃係最近實行縮短戰綫之結里，現德軍戰綫約縮短百公里·而利用其剩餘兵力張化防禦綫，至德軍司令部是否永遠採取强化維持現在之戰綫，則尚不明。聶伯河中流她區，蘇軍已於該河西岸設定橋頭堡，刻德·蘚兩軍正展開爭奪橋頭堡之激戰。中部戰綫因降雨，蘇軍僅有局部攻擊，北部戰綫蘇軍曾於數處企圖局部攻擊，但已被德車擊退。庫彭橋頭堡方面，蘇軍會連續數次加以猛攻，並曾企園於德軍後卞登陸。然均巳被德軍擊退</p>
<h3 id="c21">戰時蘇聯的外交　蘇聯戰力分析之三（一）　蘇聯對戰爭的態度 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>在戰時，如政治經濟的依從於戰爭的至上命令一樣，外交也依着戰爭的要求而運營。所以一國的外交，其努力之一，是使戰局的展開有利於己，反之，戰局的如何，決定外交所應走的方向。蘇聯的外交，不用說，亦不出於此。要檢討蘇聯的戰時外交的本實，不能不先規定蘇聯對戰爭的態度。</p>
<p>在蘇聯看來，今次的世界大戰以德蘚戰為中心，歐洲其餘的戰鬥，對英美二國的態度，對大東亞戰爭的態度，完全馬從德蘇戰分衍出來而以德蘇戰為中心。</p>
<p>德載開戰後的一九四一年七月三日，史太林向國民演說，稱德蘇戰是「祖國戰爭」乃至「祖國防衛戰爭」。這簡單的話，說明了蘚聯的戰爭目的，同時亦閘明了蘇聯對戰爭的態度</p>
<p>英美二國的言論機關，尤以紐約泰晤士報軍事記者漢遜。鮑爾溫，曾不止一次的非難說，蘇聯為了自己而遂行戰爭。沒有一個國家肯為別國而戰爭卽英美二國亦並不例外地為本國而戰，所以他們的非難，亳無理由。在各國利害錯綜複雜的此次世界大戰中，蘇聯的態度，顯然是不甚相宜。</p>
<p>蘇聯為有效地遂行對德戰爭起見，和迫求本質上相反的主義政策的英美結合，歐洲第二戰錢的要求，援助物資的要求，都只為了自由，但說得難聽一點上則蘇聯為了戰勝德國，無非在利用英美二國而巳</p>
<p>蘇聯在打倒德國的這目的上、不僅英美二國，甚至連波蘭也要結納。因此蘇聯政府的對外聲明，亦非常愼重。不脫這范團一步。</p>
<p>其例卽為蔽聯對大東亞戰爭的不參與方針。這當然是因為日蘇二國在一九四一年締結了中立條約的結果，所以美國難有百依百順，幫蘇聯的忙，借武器給蘇聯，但蘇聯始終不允參加大東亞戰爭，不肯把東亞的基地借於美國，這都是從德蘇戰的必要上出發的。</p>
<p>而且說到德蘇戰爭的要求，亦非一成不樊的。而被歐洲戰局的變化所左右。至於目前，蘚聯這根本的方針，看不出有何變化。</p>
<p>這秤蘇聯之露骨的　戰爭態度，決定其外交方針，如後所述，這在歐洲第二戰略問題上，在反軸心陳綫的內步調不統一的問題上，都在現象上興以極大的影響。而且在本晢上又引起別的問題。</p>
<p>發言權的增大</p>
<p>大家知道，在襖蘇戰勃發之前英國的狀態，可說是彷徨在崩漬的邊沿。實際上，英國一肩挑起德國武裝兵力的重壓。然而德蘇開戰的結果，蘇聯替英國曆上了德軍的重壓，英國眞非常感謝。英國在德蘇酣戰之間，利用時機，得以重整軍容。英蘇問的關係，從這種情勢出發。德蘇開戰不多時，英蘇間締結了軍事同盟條約，後來美蘇問又締結了軍事同盟。但英美蘇之問雖有所謂同盟的關係，但蘇聯一手負荷歐洲戰的重荷，仍不變如前。這情形，不能不增大蘇聯對英國約發言權，更增大了以英國為媒介的蘇聯對美國的發言權。</p>
<p>事實上，當蘇聯向英美二國要求第二戰錢時，常不中於强調蘚聯幾一手負荷德國武裝兵力的全部壓力這事實。尤以去年十一月七日，在蘇維埃政權成立二十五周年紀念演說上，史太林把蔽聯在去年夏季作戰中蒙受重大打舉的原因，歸結缺乏歐洲第二戰綫，即蘇聯全部負荷歐洲戰的重荷，而酷烈地非難英美二國。</p>
<p>去年十一月八日開始的英美軍之法屬北非侵略戰，在歐洲戰事上，情勢多少起了變化。至少美國在政治上雖似乎包藏着何種意圖，但在軍事上可說封住了蘚聯的主張。</p>
<p>然而史太林並不把英美軍的法屬北非作戰看作歐洲第二戰錢，單規定它是一個立脚點而已。一手負荷歐洲戰重荷的主張，依然未曾撤囘。</p>
<p>而且在突尼西亞戰局將近告終時，史太林在本年五月一日的第一百九十五號布告上說：</p>
<p>「紅軍從束方而來的打擊，和反軸心軍從西方而來的打擊，熔成一個打擊。」</p>
<p>所以蘇聯所主張的反軸心軍之北非作戰不是第二戰綫的意思，依然和從前亳無樊更。</p>
<p>經過第一次冬季反攻，第二次冬季反攻，愈加增高了蘇聯對英美的發言權。英美二國在本年一月的加薩勃期加會談上，特別宣言「歐洲戰第一主義」，無論其是否係實際上的必要，但可解作對蘇聯獻媚。又在本年五月中的英美華盛領會談上，亦宜稱歐洲戰第一主義並無變更，但也是對蘇聯有忌憚吧！</p>
<p>最明白地表現這種蘇聯對英美發言權之增大的，乃蘇波細交問題。蘚波絕交問題的經過，大家如道得已很詳細，這裹無須再說。這問領發端於蘚聯强迫波瑚承認舊主權問題，這無非表示蘚聯的强橫。而且英國把第一次歐洲大戰以來為英國在束歐洲盡其走狗之責的波蘭，衆之不顧，這事實亦可以淸楚地看出蘚聯發言權的增大。</p>
<p>史太林在五月四日同答紐約泰晤士報及泰晤士　莫斯科特派員派克的質問，聲明承認波蘭的獨立，但這也祗限於史太林承認　要成蘇維埃聯邦的波蘭共和國之獨立。並沒有其他的意思。最近英美空軍加强轟炸歐洲，同時並實施西西里登陸戰的結果，蘇聯的發言權不能不减低若干。不知是否即因此故，蘇聯打被了以前的拉鋸職性質，開始所謂夏季攻勢。</p>
<p>蘇聯的開始「夏季攻勢」者，或許在表示紅軍的戰力的增大，或許是呼應西西里作戰而為軍事上的必要，蘚聯似乎恢復若干已喪失的發言權，所以也可以解釋作從政治的意圓出發。總而言之，祗要英美二國不開開歐洲第二戰綫，蘇聯就不會　失在對英美的發言權上的優勢。（鸉譯自同盟世界通報一二二三號）</p>

<h3 id="c41">粉麥交流 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>全國商業統制總會粉夢專業委員會代表一行鑒於華北民食頗為嚴重，昨特乘機北行，接洽粉麥交流事宜，因傅我們囘憶今年四月間財政部周部島和上海節市長在華北接見新聞記者時的兩旬談話：周氏說：「華北是中央的華北，中央易華北的中央：國府對華北食糧問麗，物資交流交易基金的融通，必盡最大的力量，以謀救濟：」陳氏說：「無分南北，經濟必須交流，食量不過是經濟的一部。」所以，我們曾於本年五月五日、以「經濟必須交流」為題，認為從周陳二氏的言論中，可以得到一個結論，就是常前　嚴重的食糧問題之解決，還當以經濟交流為解決的基本原則。</p>
<p>所謂粉麥交流，就是一面以小麥貸款，收賣華中地區小夢，一面以所購小麥，掃數配給廠家製粉，一面以剩餘麵粉，儘量運往華北救濟。如此一個連環式的三角交流辦法，可使產麥地區，傾銷產品，以資靈活農村經濟，製粉工廠，努力生產，以期充實配給需要，絕糧境域，獲致麵粉，以資救濟災荒，城為一舉而三得。</p>
<p>即以上海民食問題而論。亦未嘗不有依然嚴重之勢，所以我們曾經說過：「今年華中各地稻毅豐收，論理不應有此現象，其癥結所在，當為農民心理重視實物，不肯盡量　出存粟所致，亟應因勢利導，輪出大量紗布，換取米麥雜糧，以解決都市之民食問題。」因此，紗布米糧交流實與粉麥交流同其重要，祇是米糧是年有出產的。假令以有盡之紗布，易無盡之米糧，似猶未為澈底。所以紗布之收買而外，紗布之生產，不可不為未雨綢繆之計。</p>

<h3 id="c52">糧食問題意見—特輯之三—糧食問題的由來 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— 姚促錟</p>
<p>說到糧食，通常即指食米。然治糧食問願者，立輸似應包括一切食物及燃料在內。</p>
<p>糧食問題本不成其為問題，亦不應使之成為問題：因一旦成為問題時，人心惶慮，其波動率涉整個社會，所及於國計民生影　之嚴重，無與倫此。而其解決方法，亦必至進載重，雖以下手。</p>
<p>問題成因</p>
<p>約貫之，戰時糧食問題，其恐慌的成因不出於</p>
<p>耕區而積的縮小，蓋一則前方廣大地區成為戰塲，兩軍相持，大好耕地無法織總農事；苒則鄉品地帶游匪散兵四出騷擾，農民生活及農產物一無保障，便不能安心務農。耕區面積的縮小，直接影　農產物產量的短少。</p>
<p>人口的集中。前卞人民退向後方，鄉區退向城市，後方安全區無形中吸收人口，且大量增加，結果被壞原有調節盈虧消長的自然法則。這情形，在仰賴區外供給的都市尤為顯著，而恐慌亦格外嚴軍。</p>
<p>農村勞力的缺乏。兵役的補給，軍需生產部門勞力的吸收，招致農民大量退出農村。農忙時節短工不易　得，且工資奇貨，自足减少農產物的產量。</p>
<p>運輸的不便。都市工鑿生產物與農產物之交流，全賴交通利便，而戰時交通工具的徵發，衝要地帶的封鎖隔絕，匪徒痞棍的魚肉良善等，在在妨礙次通利倆與安全，形成都市缺乏農產物，而農村　　工業品。</p>
<p>糧　的接濟。軍事勝利取決於種種條件，而糧糧的供應無缺，亦為主要條件之一。大址的收購備屯，在勢不免，使巳感不足的農產物更見不足。</p>
<p>解決辦法</p>
<p>分析所得大略如此、針述對上，其對策是　開發耕地，凡可用以耕種的空地應細大不捐，儘量開發利用，以增加耕區而積，鄕區地帶自淸鄉後、秩序良好，已確保治安者，亦應勸令農民復歸，務便耕者有用武之地，而地盡其利，則產量自可增加。</p>
<p>疎散都市人口。農民旣復歸農村，而無留居都市必要者，也應移向農村，使都市與農村問人口比率不致相差過鉅，則都布糧食問題的嚴重性必可减輕。</p>
<p>開發耕地，使農民復歸農柯，及疎散都市人口之後，都市內過剩的劵力倆可用之於農事，使勞力的供求有通當的調節。人盡其用，而糧食問題因此亦可有部分的解決。</p>
<p>運輸的便利與安蚤。一面應將現有的交通工且全部組織起來、加以滴當的統制，使能允分的運用；政府當局亦應充實醫衛力，以維持路綫的安蚤。一面應商請友邦協助，使都市與農村物資的交流圓滑穩妥『則貨暢其流，有無相通，輿　食問題必有裨益。</p>
<p>糧糧的接濟，最好能明示數量，劃淸地區，某區在一定期限內應負　分攤多少，若有不足，再由鄰區撥給抵充。如此糧精皆可就地取得，則旣免　辦醫這之　，而軍　之外，一區產銷額之　餘輿不足，皆有成竹，於調節分配上，自有恃無恐。</p>
<p>以上皆　解決戰時糧食的主要方法。</p>
<p>增產問題</p>
<p>此外還有幾個問題、値得討輸。一是糧食的增座問題。</p>
<p>我國的農業經濟是小農生產制，生產方法與生歷工具，都是亞細亞的。原始的，這對於技術的改進與生產量的增加上，是莫大的障礙。應舉辦模節農塲及普植塲，利用科學方法。新的設施，以改進技術，使農民有所取法，而求產量的增加，政府並應公布獎勵生產的方案。若收獲量超越水準者、應給予獎勵；凡對農業生產技術及農具上有所發明改簪老，亦應優予獎勵。</p>
<p>學校常局應督率學生下田，定為課外活動的必需科目：有校圓或運動塲者應闢作農塲，改植蔬菜，樂養家畜，以供學生佐餐。公共塲所亦應利用。聞為農塲，凡非必要的農業生產物，如烟草等，一律禁止播種。</p>
<p>農具售給農民，應定一公平合理的價格。豆髒貴至一二百元，肥田粉解有配給，為數不多，因此施肥困難。應設法予以抑低，配給量亦應有適當的增加。以使農產物的成本减輕。</p>
<p>配給問題</p>
<p>第二是糧食的配給問題。每一城市，以縣為單位。實行公翰。配給數量與價格應顧及人民的負擔；戶口調查應詳確，不准虛報浮報；規定私人的儲藏量，越出定額者處罰之。而配給亦必定時定量。以安人心，凡經手人有尅扣口糧之惡行者，鼓勵輿論告發嚴懲。再由公家主辦大規模的農產物倉庫，冷藏庫，調節盈虧，以便採辦與儲屯、凡有關糧食的主管官署應鑒於「不患寡而患不均」彼此應互通聲氣。緊密聯繫，以取得整齊的步伐，而使糧食有公正中均的　給，</p>
<p>消費問題</p>

<h3 id="c53">上海糧食配給機構之所調整及其方策（二） <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— 黃垂聖</p>
<p>糧食分配「瀾」之不均——糧食分配之制度，普通可分為三種；一種罵髒許制度，一種是政府直接管理分給各發制廣；另外一種是樣食券制贊。以上三種制度，除第一種外，第二第三種　，則為今日上海實施類如此稱是也。所謂政府直接管理分給各　制度，正如今日上海組織之商統會或各種配給組合織成，雖此稱皆由人民組織，然政府人員亦為幕後之人者多。大戰時，德爾組織戰時賢養部創立公益戰時毅物公司作為供給機　，以後久設帝國穀物局。此種組織制度，止與今日　商統會　同樣辦法。至於糧食劵制度，各國皆採用之，其普遞情形，不亞於戲院購票入座之原則也然。則今日上海糧食配給數量問題，實屬嚴重。雖然今日江蘇一省糧食無須外供，然我當曆何以致我人民於飢僅薦獰之嘆。須知政府應規定最低總犧牲之定量分配，不得任意增減。</p>
<p>不但如此，吾人更知決定糧食消醫量之多寡，尚有其他因索存在，如鄉村男女與都市男女食量之差別，年齡大小與食量之差別等，皆有莫大之關係。今我上海市民，每期領得之糧食，實能果腹幾餐乎？此種嚴重問題務求我當局，應深思之。</p>
<p>另外。我們應加注意，則市民之間分配數量務求其平等。務求我當局應施「一視同仁」之策，予以全滬市民之平等義務。</p>
<p>糧食消費節約之實行——開源簡流，為今日我市民全體之義務。欲以有限之物資，供全市之用，非力求節約不可，顧節約之道，有由國民自動實行，有以國家實行之。今略述之如下：</p>
<p>國民自動之節約——處於今日生死存亡之時，國民果能了解糧食與戰爭重要之關係，應自動創行節衣節食之舉、以濟闕家之急需。積極創舉一糧食節約運動一普及於全國之都市或村鎭，其目的在求國民，家庭中之糧食，肉，糖，油等之節約用量。而我政府應先予以鼓勵及指導之。　命令全市　育機關不論大中小各學校於紀念過　，予以相當教導，對基一般消費日用品，不得有任意灘用、或於一般商店戰員，授以民衆節約常織。　在各家庭糧食及其　贊價值之科學里解，予以市民實行據大藉報紙，學樣演請等而為宣傳。</p>
<p>分送關於糧食知職之文書，其種類可分為：</p>
<p>（甲）如何才是避免濫費。</p>
<p>（乙）何物可利用為作菜。</p>
<p>（丙）經米之成份與白米成份互相比較</p>
<p>（丁）大豆含有墍富之維他命。</p>
<p>（戊）果實與蔬菜之乾燥法及其製造　頭法。</p>
<p>（己）山芋如何才能長時間之貯藏</p>
<p>（庚）鼓勵市民小園地之種菜。</p>
<p>以上所述，為我今日上海市民應有之責任，今上海報端雖市提倡此舉，然未見其澈底之精神，諸如酒樓，飯店，茶室，咖啡館，依然故我，所謂西菜百元工右一客，中菜千元以上一桌，皆為司空見慣之例，實應禁止。</p>
<p>國家强制之節約；茲如上述，以觀今日上海市民之自治精神，以行節約，恐其效能不能充分發揮，其結果。政府遂小得不有强制各人消費節約之必要。凡我當局有鑒及此，應速明文限定各大小酒樓飯店，以人聯為比例不得超過政府公定標準價格，以抱共甘共苦之精神，實行「言行合一」不變之政策。</p>
<p>强統制配給機　——糧食統制政策旣如上述，至於如何欲以配給機構之健全，必須設立糧食統制配給機關以為　備通盤之計副。我上海市前乃由華中來穀配給組合，將米撥交前工部局及市糧倉局，而轉分配各註册之來店憑票　給市民。自本年七月問起改移於聯營社，因組織不健全。未能收教</p>
<p>統觀　歐諸例，糧食統制配給一事，　應直爍政府辦理，今我當局移為民營、可想而知然則政府應助其一臂之力，以暢運輸之便，而免態捐雜稅之害。正如張雲搏先生在九月五日申報之星期評論所述：「稅率例規有定，尙不　負　，而　查巡據，檢查工役，則關口如綱，一絲不漏，其數或倍　於公家所得　件奸犯科者，更上下其手，從中作崇，使米價愈漲愈高…」此乃豈為時勢　然者乎。今為調　其健全織構，不妨略述於下，　有戰者參考之助。</p>
<p>其組織範團　包括有：　生　統制組。　消費統制組。　為價格統制組，　分配統制組，　貿易統制相。</p>
<p>此五組之職務皆為注意市民糧食之需要及供求。其中委員應有六分之二為滬上大學現任院長，至於下部人才聘用當為愼重</p>
<p>强迫人口疏散　糧　問題與人口多寡有莫大之關係，今日滬上人口增至五百餘萬，此種增加之勢，致使糧食供給逐漸減少，是故人口非以强迫　散不可。國家造此一班舞　游民，不但影響治安而　危害民食，是故此次何甲第二次調查戶口，密切注意該輩無業之民,呈報當局，　我當局應採强迫返鄕政策，務使該輩以免為寄生蟲之類。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>論人論事皆有所論，今而論米，可證古人之「民以食為天」之先見也。今我上海一市，糧食問題，至為重要，視為嚴載，故凡　市民務求克勤克儉，節衣而食，力謀今彼生活之安定。嗚呼，民不安，其能晏然無驚乎。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japan Strengthens Domestic Posture in Relation to China <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese government, considering the current increasingly tense global war situation, and to establish a sure-win posture for the nation to maintain permanent peace in East Asia, studied the policy of strengthening national policy management last month. In the cabinet meeting on September 21, after seven hours of deliberation, the outline of national policy management was approved. In the cabinet meeting on September 28, in order to realize the strengthening of the domestic system, it was decided to: convene an extraordinary cabinet meeting; establish a Ministry of Munitions. Between these two major decisions, there was the matter of Wang Jingwei's visit to Japan to promote the situation in Japan, which is the most noteworthy new development in recent East Asian affairs. According to an announcement issued by the Japanese Information Bureau, the content of the Japanese government's recently decided policy of strengthening its domestic posture is as follows. The goals of this strengthening are: (A) to make the public thoroughly understand the meaning of this war and to make them realize that its completion is not easy, and to be determined to hold the belief of certain victory and to show unwavering loyalty to the country. (B) To devote national power to rapidly increase production, especially focusing on the replenishment of aviation combat power. (C) To establish absolute self-sufficiency in food for both Japan and Manchukuo. (D) To strengthen domestic defense. From this, it can be seen that this epoch-making decision of Japan is entirely based on the new situation of the world war and adopts a policy of concentrating national strength to ensure a winning position. Looking at the content of the policy to strengthen the domestic situation, it becomes even clearer:</p>
<p>First, it is to realize a decisive battle posture through consistent management. The main and specific policies are: Thorough and rapid implementation of administrative reporting; Thorough simplification of the budget; Thorough simplification of official affairs; Reorganization of administrative agencies, further reduction of administrative personnel; Uninterrupted operation of functions. This administrative policy for war is in line with our government's consistent request for "implementing streamlined administration" and "improving administrative efficiency." It is hoped that a serious and dynamic new atmosphere will be created among all levels of government, without wasting manpower or resources. Time, striving for national prosperity, is truly overcoming current difficulties. Clarifying politics and strengthening government authority and administrative efficiency are prerequisites. Our friendly nation has already taken the lead, and our country should not lag behind. This is the first thing we should strive for.</p>
<p>Second, Japan's policy of strengthening the domestic situation this time also pays special attention to the thorough mobilization of the people. The specific policies are: Stop the general method of drafting ordinary soldiers; Except for students majoring in engineering, a system of delaying entry into the army will be established, and schools that organize and supplement science departments will be consolidated. The scope of major useful applications, those originally exempted from the list other than special recipients, will also be completely abolished. Strengthen women's mobilization. Rapidly implement appropriate job allocation. Abolish the age limit for retirement in various industries and use older people as much as possible. Under a comprehensive plan, the manpower saved will be used to participate in the execution of the war. Continue eight years of compulsory education. All of the above new policies are aimed at thoroughly mobilizing the people to concentrate national strength on the war effort. In terms of manpower, the scope of recruitment will be expanded, stipulating that men aged 14 to 40 in 17 occupations directly related to the war or who can be employed by children are restricted from employment. Therefore, there is a vast field of occupation where women can be mobilized to take on jobs, allowing men to engage in careers directly related to Zhangzhou. This method of thorough mobilization is one of the key factors for victory in today's total war. Looking back at our country, the national strength is still scattered as before. Can we not urgently and directly advance to shoulder the sacred duty of "jointly safeguarding East Asia"? This is the second thing we should strive for.</p>
<p>Third, in order to thoroughly strengthen the domestic defense posture, the policies decided to be adopted are: To realize the unification of domestic defense administrative operations. For important national areas, military and militarily important factories, mines, etc., strengthen air defense capabilities as much as possible. It was decided that the government should take the lead in implementing it, and order all public organizations, various control agencies, and control companies to implement the necessary arrangements in accordance with the government's methods. Implement a comprehensive plan for the evacuation of government offices and other institutions and personnel to various places. Promote the improvement of private enterprises and implement the arrangement of civilian houses and shops in Tokyo and other important cities in accordance with the government's arrangement methods. All of these policies are naturally necessary preparations aimed at the so-called "Pacific Counterattack" of the United States and Britain. The "counterattack" plan clearly includes the conspiracy to use Chinese territory and airspace as a battlefield. Therefore, we must also strive for perfection in all aspects of defense and air defense preparations for important cities, factories, mines, government offices, schools, and civilian houses. Especially in a corner like Shanghai, where the population is concentrated to more than five million, it is not a phenomenon that should exist during a decisive battle. In case of emergency, it can easily lead to unnecessary losses and problems with food and security. Therefore, it is necessary to consider implementing the necessary evacuation work. This is the third thing we should strive for.</p>
<p>In the concrete measures for strengthening the domestic situation in Japan this time, which are implemented in various departments of political affairs, economy, and culture, in addition to those mentioned above, the main ones also include the following: In order to seek a clearer expression of the national character of important enterprises in business management, capital is concentrated on combat power and important tasks, and personnel are reduced. The core of this strengthening of the domestic situation is the close integration of the military and national affairs, so that the public and private sectors can work together with the belief of certain victory to jointly seek the rapid increase of military demand production, especially aviation production. This method of strengthening cooperation between officials and the people, concentrating national strength, strengthening production, and increasing combat power is worth our study and realization. This is the fourth thing we should strive for.</p>
<p>In order to concentrate national strength to increase production and replenish aviation, the Japanese cabinet also decided on September 28 to abolish the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Enterprise Agency and establish a Ministry of Munitions. On the same day, the Japanese cabinet decided to convene an extraordinary meeting from October 25 to present laws and budgets related to national policy management under the current situation. After the parliament faces domestic and foreign countries to express the government's determination to complete the war, it will raise the people's belief in victory and strengthen national unity. In addition to the budget necessary to increase combat power, the bill includes: those related to budget preparation, those related to judicial simplification, those related to munitions companies, those related to strengthening air defense, those related to the duties of parliamentarians, and those that have become increasingly fierce. "Our 100 million people should renew their determination and use their courage to concentrate their total strength on the completion of the war. Special research. At this critical moment, consistent loyalty is the root of our country's sure victory." In fact, this is not only the responsibility of Japan's 100 million people, but also the common responsibility of the 1 billion people of East Asia.</p>
<p>At the time of Japan's strengthening of its domestic situation, the visit of our Chairman Wang to Japan and the comings and goings of Ambassador Gu and Ambassador Cai between Tokyo and Nanjing, we firmly believe that there will be major developments in the further strengthening of Sino-Japanese relations in the future and the promotion of the total war between China and Japan. However, the factors to gain a favorable position lie in seeking the right track of politics, as well as in improving the people's livelihood and further promoting the concentration of national strength, so as to be able to shoulder our mission, and work together with Japan to jointly ensure the liberation of the East Asian nations and permanent peace in the Pacific.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Japan Strengthening Administrative Agencies, Concrete Plans Being Drafted, Decision to Establish Ministries of Agriculture, Commerce, and Transportation &amp; Communication <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) - In order to fully exert national strength and establish a decisive battle posture, the Japanese government is strengthening and reorganizing administrative agencies. The cabinet meeting on the 2nd decided to establish new Ministries of Agriculture and Commerce and Transportation and Communication, in order to make the national policy management under the current situation more strengthened. The Information Bureau President issued a statement in this regard, the general idea of which is as follows: Regarding the reorganization of the administrative agencies based on the previously decided outline of national policy management under the current situation, a concrete plan is currently being drafted. Regarding the abolition and merger of provinces, the policy of establishing a Ministry of Munitions has been decided earlier, and the policy of establishing Ministries of Agriculture and Commerce and Transportation and Communication was also decided in today's cabinet meeting. So far, there will be no further changes in the provinces. The government is convinced that the basic posture of the central agency that should respond to the requirements of the war situation can therefore be established. As for the specific plans for the reorganization of internal agencies and affairs of various provinces, each department is currently drafting them as soon as possible. Due to this measure, personnel in various aspects may have military service and transfer to other unions. Therefore, these personnel are in a more necessary position to implement the war. The government has decided to continue to establish measures such as the system of extra personnel in accordance with previous examples, in order to ensure everything.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Information Bureau released at 5:30 pm on the 2nd: (A) Matters concerning the establishment of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce. In order to establish self-sufficiency in food for Japan and Manchukuo and ensure the people's living materials in order to stabilize the wartime national life, the Japanese government decided to transfer the matters under the jurisdiction of the former Ministry of Commerce and Industry that are less related to military needs (excluding transactions) to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is being reorganized, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is renamed the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce. Matters related to transactions are transferred to the management of the Greater East Asia Ministry. The reorganization of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry will be implemented from November 1st. The relevant authorities are currently preparing as soon as possible. (B) Matters concerning the establishment of the Ministry of Transportation and Communication. The Japanese government is based on the outline of national policy management under the current situation. In order to expedite the comprehensive transportation by sea and land and seek to exert wartime communication power, the Ministry of Transportation and Communication was established. The Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications were abolished. The Ministry of Transportation and Communication is formed on the basis of the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications, and is in charge of comprehensive transportation by sea and land and matters related to it, as well as matters related to communication. In order to accomplish the above-mentioned purposes, the customs, warehouses, ports, civil engineering, port affairs, and other port affairs administration, automobile transportation administration, and other matters necessary for transportation, which are managed by other provinces, are transferred to the management of the Ministry of Transportation and Communication. Measures will be taken to make active military officers of the army and navy officials of the Ministry of Transportation and Communication. When planning the organization of the Ministry of Transportation and Communication, the main goal should be to make its organization frugal and powerful, and more attention should be paid to avoid reducing its efficiency. The Ministry of Transportation and Communication will begin its work on November 1st. The relevant authorities are currently preparing as soon as possible. (Remarks) Regarding the land transportation between China, Japan, and Manchukuo, it was decided to take measures that can be used consistently. Matters related to electricity under the jurisdiction of the former Ministry of Communications should be transferred to the management of the Ministry of Munitions.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The capital's sugar allocation scandal, which has shocked the country, has been under custody since the authorities detained the main offenders, Tu Shutong and Chen Wenjian.

The case is currently under investigation by the Capital Police Commissioner's Office. It is heard that once the evidence is collected, it will be submitted to the court for public prosecution.</p>

<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports: After the naval fort in Venice was occupied by German troops, two Italian generals and 50 Italian soldiers were disarmed. The surrender of Venice was due to the fierce shelling of the port by German torpedo boats against the Italian army's coastal artillery. The Italian troops were disarmed by a small team of German soldiers. German naval lieutenant Smith, in front of the representatives of the senior officials and civilians, the chief of medicine and the local officials of Venice, announced the conditions of surrender. His report to the German naval commander in Italy stated: "Two Italian generals and 15,000 soldiers of the Venice artillery team have been captured."</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The military correspondent Setoris of the Haitong News Agency said: Allied forces continued to land a fresh army in ports such as Tarentum and Brindisi. Some of this fresh army is assisting the British Eighth Army, but most of it seems to be using La Puhaha as a springboard to attack the Balkans. According to reports, the US Seventh Army's whereabouts are unknown after the Sicily campaign.</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The Haitong News Agency reports that according to responsible sources, German troops withdrew from the city of Naples on Friday. The city was severely damaged. US troops attempted to follow up and advance at noon on Friday, but were repelled by the German rearguard forces on both sides of Mount Vesuvius.</p>
<p>Naples, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Haitong News Agency war correspondent Weber said: At 6:00 pm on September 28, a Communist traitor group attempted to seize power in Naples. At that time, the German demolition team was busy destroying the last important military equipment in the city. Thousands of civilians suddenly opened fire on the team and attacked the German mechanized units. The German soldiers shot alone in the streets were also ambushed, and bombs were thrown in front of the German authorities. The traitors even implemented a cordon around the hospital where German wounded soldiers were staying. They thought that the US Fifth Army could be expected to occupy Naples that night, but the German troops were still making strong resistance at various points, so the progress of the Anglo-American forces was very slow. Therefore, the new war zone in the city of Naples was isolated. The German commander immediately took countermeasures and sent troops into the city to suppress the rebels. The wounded soldiers have been rescued. The rebel resistance points are now in the area around the station and the main roads in the city. Machine guns are erected at high places, but the German troops fought hard with them and have turned the tide. The traitors' actions were obviously planned for a long time, so they launched the attack when there were few German troops in the city. Now, the rapid action of the German troops and the failure of the US troops to enter the city in time have made them quite frightened.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - Washington (Haitong News Agency) - A senior U.S. official with close ties to Italian developments stated yesterday that General Dwight D. Eisenhower and Marshal Pietro Badoglio are currently holding meetings to discuss the recognition of the Badoglio regime as a co-belligerent. This move has the consent of both the British and Soviet governments. The purpose of this recognition is to counteract Mussolini's appeal to the Italian people. Badoglio is engaged in extensive discussions with the anti-Axis powers, but no announcement can be made at this time.</p>
<p>Tangier, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to sources in Algiers, Marshal Badoglio has been residing at General Eisenhower's headquarters for some time. He has made genuine contributions to the Anglo-American plans for the occupation of Italy, and has also provided intelligence related to bombing targets.

<h3 id="e20">Fierce German Counterattacks on the Lower Dnieper River; Both Armies Vie for Bridgeheads on the West Bank <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - German authorities announced on the 1st that in recent days, German resistance has been increasing in several areas on the Eastern Front. Fierce German counterattacks are particularly intense in the area between Zaporozhye and Melitopol on the lower Dnieper River. The Soviet army had already intensified its attacks five days ago, and on September 30th, it deployed new troops – three corps consisting of 15 infantry divisions, tank brigades, and numerous artillery units – in an attempt to break through the approximately 118-kilometer German defensive line between Zaporozhye and Melitopol. However, after several successive strong defensive battles, the German army has repelled the attacks. The Soviet army deployed 250 tanks, of which 140 were destroyed. The increased German resistance in this area is the result of the recent shortening of the battle line. The German line has now been shortened by about 100 kilometers, and the remaining troops are being used to strengthen the defensive line. It remains unclear whether the German command will permanently maintain the current line. In the central section of the Dnieper River, the Soviet army has established bridgeheads on the west bank, and fierce battles are currently underway between the German and Soviet armies for control of these bridgeheads. Due to rainfall, the Soviet army has only launched localized attacks on the central front. On the northern front, the Soviet army has attempted localized attacks in several locations, but they have been repelled by the German army. In the Kupen bridgehead area, the Soviet army has launched repeated attacks and has even attempted landings behind German lines, but all have been repelled by the German army.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Wartime Soviet Diplomacy - An Analysis of Soviet War Power, Part 3 (1) - The Soviet Attitude Towards the War <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>During wartime, just as politics and economics are subordinate to the supreme command of war, diplomacy also operates according to the demands of war. Therefore, one of a nation's diplomatic efforts is to ensure that the development of the war situation is favorable to itself. Conversely, the course of the war determines the direction that diplomacy should take. Soviet diplomacy, needless to say, is no exception to this. To examine the essence of Soviet wartime diplomacy, one must first define the Soviet attitude towards the war.</p>
<p>From the Soviet perspective, the current world war revolves around the German-Soviet war. The other battles in Europe, the attitude towards Britain and the United States, and the attitude towards the Greater East Asia War, are all derived from and centered on the German-Soviet war.</p>
<p>On July 3, 1941, after the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, Stalin addressed the nation, calling the German-Soviet war a "war of the fatherland" and even a "war for the defense of the fatherland." These simple words explained the Soviet war aims and clarified the Soviet attitude towards the war.</p>
<p>The media organs of Britain and the United States, especially Hanson W. Baldwin, the military correspondent for the New York Times, have repeatedly criticized the Soviet Union for waging war for its own sake. No country is willing to wage war for another country. Even Britain and the United States are fighting for their own interests, so their criticism is groundless. In the complex and intertwined interests of the current world war, the Soviet attitude is clearly not very appropriate.</p>
<p>In order to effectively wage war against Germany, the Soviet Union allied itself with Britain and the United States, despite their fundamentally opposing ideologies and policies. The demands for a second front in Europe and for material assistance were all for the sake of freedom. However, to put it bluntly, the Soviet Union was simply using Britain and the United States to defeat Germany.</p>
<p>In order to achieve its goal of defeating Germany, the Soviet Union was willing to ally itself not only with Britain and the United States, but even with Poland. Therefore, the Soviet government's external pronouncements were very cautious, never deviating from this framework.</p>
<p>An example of this is the Soviet Union's policy of non-participation in the Greater East Asia War. This was, of course, due to the neutrality treaty concluded between Japan and the Soviet Union in 1941. Therefore, while the United States found it difficult to refuse Soviet requests, helping and lending weapons to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union consistently refused to participate in the Greater East Asia War and refused to lend its bases in East Asia to the United States. All of this stemmed from the necessities of the German-Soviet war.</p>
<p>Moreover, the demands of the German-Soviet war were not fixed and immutable, but were influenced by changes in the European war situation. As for the present, there is no sign of any change in these fundamental Soviet policies.</p>
<p>This frank Soviet attitude towards the war determined its diplomatic policy. As will be discussed later, this had a significant impact on the issue of a second front in Europe and on the lack of unified coordination within the anti-Axis alliance. Furthermore, it raised other fundamental questions.</p>
<p>The Increase in Speaking Rights</p>
<p>As everyone knows, before the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, Britain was on the verge of collapse. In reality, Britain was bearing the brunt of the German military power. However, as a result of the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, the Soviet Union relieved Britain of the heavy pressure of the German army, for which Britain was truly grateful. During the German-Soviet war, Britain seized the opportunity to reorganize its military strength. The relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union originated from this situation. Not long after the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, Britain and the Soviet Union concluded a military alliance treaty. Later, the United States and the Soviet Union also concluded a military alliance. However, despite the so-called alliance relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union continued to bear the heavy burden of the European war. This situation could not but increase the Soviet Union's speaking rights vis-à-vis Britain, and further increase the Soviet Union's speaking rights vis-à-vis the United States, with Britain acting as an intermediary.</p>
<p>In fact, when the Soviet Union demanded a second front from Britain and the United States, it often emphasized the fact that the Soviet Union was bearing almost the entire pressure of the German military power. In particular, on the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the Soviet regime on November 7 of last year, Stalin attributed the heavy losses suffered by the Soviet Union in the summer campaign of last year to the lack of a second front in Europe, namely that the Soviet Union was bearing the entire burden of the European war, and harshly criticized Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>The Anglo-American invasion of French North Africa, which began on November 8 of last year, brought about some changes in the European war situation. At least militarily, the United States seemed to be blocking the Soviet Union's claims, although politically it seemed to harbor some intentions.</p>
<p>However, Stalin did not regard the Anglo-American operations in French North Africa as a second front in Europe, but merely defined it as a foothold. The claim that the Soviet Union was bearing the entire burden of the European war had not been withdrawn.</p>
<p>Moreover, as the Tunisian campaign drew to a close, Stalin said in his Proclamation No. 195 on May 1 of this year:</p>
<p>"The strike of the Red Army from the east and the strike of the anti-Axis forces from the west have merged into one strike."</p>
<p>Therefore, the Soviet Union's view that the anti-Axis operations in North Africa were not a second front remained unchanged from before.</p>
<p>After the first winter counteroffensive and the second winter counteroffensive, the Soviet Union's speaking rights vis-à-vis Britain and the United States further increased. At the Casablanca Conference in January of this year, Britain and the United States issued a special declaration of "Europe First," which, regardless of whether it was a practical necessity, could be interpreted as flattery towards the Soviet Union. Also, at the Anglo-American Washington Conference in May of this year, it was declared that the "Europe First" principle remained unchanged, but this was also out of fear of the Soviet Union!</p>
<p>The most obvious manifestation of this increase in the Soviet Union's speaking rights vis-à-vis Britain and the United States was the Soviet-Polish diplomatic issue. The details of the breakdown of Soviet-Polish relations are well known, and there is no need to repeat them here. This issue originated from the Soviet Union's forcing Poland to recognize the old sovereignty, which undoubtedly indicated the Soviet Union's overbearingness. Moreover, the fact that Britain disregarded Poland, which had been Britain's lapdog in Eastern Europe since the First World War, clearly showed the increase in the Soviet Union's speaking rights.</p>
<p>Stalin, in answering questions from the New York Times and the Moscow correspondent of The Times, Parker, on May 4, declared recognition of Poland's independence, but this was limited to Stalin's recognition of the independence of a Polish republic that would become part of the Soviet Union. It had no other meaning. Recently, as the Anglo-American air forces have intensified their bombing of Europe and carried out the invasion of Sicily, the Soviet Union's speaking rights have inevitably decreased somewhat. Perhaps for this reason, the Soviet Union has abandoned its previous policy of attrition and begun its so-called summer offensive.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's decision to launch a "summer offensive" may be to show the increased combat power of the Red Army, or it may be a military necessity in response to the Sicilian operations. The Soviet Union seems to be regaining some of the speaking rights it had lost, so it can also be interpreted as originating from political motives. In short, as long as Britain and the United States do not open a second front in Europe, the Soviet Union will not lose its advantage in its speaking rights vis-à-vis Britain and the United States.

In fact, the authorities themselves are also dispatching personnel to conduct secret investigations. As a result, it has been discovered that there are still cases of collecting "tea money", where such individuals are charging renters the highest prices for the most dilapidated and substandard furniture.</p>

<p>The Commerce Control Committee is extremely cautious in handling the import or export of major food items. To facilitate merchants and citizens, it has repeatedly improved the application procedures. According to a reporter's investigation, the committee has recently noted that many applications received by the Permit Affairs Group in the past have been rejected or returned for resubmission due to non-compliance with the procedures. In the past, the reviewer only wrote the reasons on the application form, and the staff in charge of receiving and sending the application would then hand the application to the applicant to read. This often led to misunderstandings. To ensure that merchants and citizens thoroughly understand the reasons, the committee has printed a form listing the reasons for the return or rejection of applications. In the future, all applications will be accepted. If, after review, an application does not comply with the procedures and cannot be approved or must be returned, the form will be filled out, clearly stating the reasons for the rejection or return, and the form will be stamped with the group's seal to indicate its solemnity.</p>

Pan Yuqie, the novelist who won the Greater East Asia Literary Award this time, also attended. After the ceremony, Chairman Zhou Huarong delivered an opening speech, stating that the welcome rally had three meanings: 1. To use the oriental culture of the "kingly way" to resolve the hegemonic thinking of the West. 2. To use the consciousness of a common East Asian culture to gather strength and guarantee the victory of the Greater East Asia War. 3. The East Asian literary renaissance. Zhou Yueran, Lu Feng, Liu Yusheng, Qiu Yunduo, and Guan Lu then delivered speeches in succession. The chairman then presented the Outstanding Award for Chinese Literary Artists selected by the Second Literary Congress to Pan Yuqie. The Director of the Shanghai Branch of the Mainichi Shimbun presented a cash prize on behalf of the newspaper. Finally, the chairman delivered a closing speech. After the meeting, a Japanese aviation film was shown to add to the atmosphere. At 6:30 PM, the association held a banquet at the Lianyou Club in the Broadway Mansions for the returning delegates and literary award winners.

At the same time, the organization can build its own office and carry out all its work. Therefore, local gentry and commercial leaders have jointly initiated the organization. In addition to connecting with emotions, discussing business development, and building everything, the association's functions will work closely with the investigation work of the Shanghai Office of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<p>Economic Circles: Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e41">Flour and Wheat Exchange <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>A delegation from the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the National Commercial Control Association, seeing the severity of the food situation in North China, took a flight north yesterday to discuss the exchange of flour and wheat. This is because we recall the conversation between Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Finance and the Mayor of Shanghai Chen during their meeting with journalists in North China in April this year. Mr. Zhou said: "North China is the North China of the Central Government, and the Central Government is the Central Government of North China. The National Government will do its utmost to provide relief for the food problem in North China, and to facilitate the exchange of materials and the transaction of funds." Mr. Chen said: "Regardless of the north or south, the economy must be exchanged, and food is only a part of the economy." Therefore, we once wrote on May 5 this year, under the title "Economic Exchange is Necessary," that we can draw a conclusion from the remarks of Zhou and Chen, that is, the solution to the current serious food problem should still be based on economic exchange as the basic principle.</p>
<p>The so-called flour and wheat exchange is a three-way exchange method: first, use wheat loans to purchase wheat in the Central China region; second, allocate all the purchased wheat to factories for flour production; and third, transport the remaining flour to North China for relief as much as possible. Such a continuous triangular exchange method can enable wheat-producing areas to sell their products, thereby invigorating the rural economy; flour mills to work hard to produce, in order to meet the needs of distribution; and food-scarce areas to obtain flour for disaster relief, achieving a win-win situation.</p>
<p>Even taking the food problem in Shanghai as an example, it is not without a still serious trend. Therefore, we once said: "This year, there has been a bumper harvest of rice in various parts of Central China. Logically, this phenomenon should not exist. The key lies in the fact that farmers value physical objects and are unwilling to release their stored grain as much as possible. It is urgent to take advantage of the situation and release a large amount of cotton cloth to exchange for rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains to solve the food problem in the city." Therefore, the exchange of cotton cloth and grain is as important as the exchange of flour and wheat. It's just that the grain is produced this year. If unlimited grain is exchanged for limited cotton cloth, it still seems not thorough. Therefore, in addition to the purchase of cotton cloth, the production of cotton cloth must be planned for the future.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Industrial and Commercial Association Held Third Member Congress Yesterday, Elected Third Council <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Association, initiated and organized by the Chinese and Japanese industrial and commercial circles, has held two sessions of development since its establishment on September 3 last year. At 5:30 pm yesterday (the 2nd), the third member congress was held in the conference of the association, and the Chinese and Japanese officials attended to guide. The third council was elected on the spot. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Grand Occasion of the Congress</p>
<p>Chinese and Japanese officials: Including Mayor Chen of the Municipal Government, Secretary-General Zhao Zun-yue, Deputy Director Su Cheng-de of the First Police Bureau, Director Liang Xiu-yu of the Propaganda Department, Minister Tajiri of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, Secretary Iwai, Vice-Consul Fukuma, and Interpreter Hirata, etc., and more than 100 members of the association. The congress was presided over by Wen Lan-ting, who gave the opening speech. The candidates for the council were nominated. Then, the Chinese and Japanese officials gave speeches in succession. Then, Toraji Kurimoto reported on the association's affairs over the past year. Finally, the newly appointed Chairman Takeo Komuro took office and gave an inaugural speech. After the meeting, a frugal vegetable dinner was held. During the dinner, the Deng Wenqing Troupe performed magic, students from the Shanghai Drama School performed Peking Opera, and the Greater East Asia News Film was shown. The gathering ended happily at 10 pm. The chairman's speech briefly stated: "Our association has been established for a year, and with the support of all parties, the association's affairs are progressing day by day. This association was initiated and organized by people from the Chinese and Japanese industrial and commercial sectors. The common purpose is to communicate the will of the industrial and commercial sectors of both sides and to complete the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere through the cooperation of both sides. Since its establishment, although the colleagues have limited abilities, they have all been moving forward towards this goal, contributing to the construction of Greater East Asia. This congress coincides with the first anniversary. According to the regulations, the members of the council should be re-elected. In addition to the new list of council members to be announced separately, the chairmanship is taken by both sides in turn. Therefore, Mr. Komuro is invited to take the position this time. In the future, under the leadership of Mr. Komuro, the association's affairs will have more development, which can be expected."</p>
<p>Zhao Zun-yue's Speech</p>
<p>Briefly stated: "In terms of the Greater East Asia, the scope is very broad. Shanghai is the most important industrial and commercial hub. Looking back on the past, the industrial and commercial development of Shanghai was controlled by the British and Americans. It is difficult for people in Greater East Asia to take the lead. It is now up to our people to take responsibility for revitalizing industry and commerce. The Industrial and Commercial Association is organized by people from the industrial and commercial circles of China and Japan. Its mission is important not only because of the emotional contact in business, but also to promote the cooperation between China and Japan through the convenience of this association."</p>
<p>Tajiri's Speech</p>
<p>Briefly stated: "The Industrial and Commercial Association communicates the will of the industrial and commercial circles of China and Japan. Both sides cooperate and communicate, and the understanding of the general public is very deep. I express my gratitude to you here. Now, during the Greater East Asia War, China and Japan should be closer. I would like to state three points: Japan respects China's autonomy. China and Japan mutually enhance production and development. The unfortunate frictions that occurred between China and Japan in the past were caused by the British and Americans挑拨.除英美魔力, 骗出东亚, 日本对除英美魔力, 骗出东亚, 日本对除英美魔力, 骗出东亚, 日本对此莫不尽量努力. Regarding these three points, in this Greater East Asia War, the relationship between China and Japan has been on the right track, and the construction of Greater Shanghai especially depends on the cooperation of you all to achieve success."</p>

<p>In the China-Japan-France-Portugal International Charity Tennis Tournament, the Chinese team defeated the Japanese team 2-1 in the final yesterday and won the championship. The performance was quite wonderful. The Mei Tong Public School was crowded with enthusiastic spectators. After the match, Mayor Chen presented the awards, and the event was successfully completed. The results of yesterday's competition are as follows:</p>
<p>First Singles: Tao Guan-qiu (China) defeated Baba (Japan) 6-1, 6-2.</p>
<p>Second Singles: Zhang Ding-zhao (China) defeated Isobe Kameo 7-5, 6-2.</p>
<p>Doubles: Yamaishi Seiichi and Fukushi Saburo (Japan) defeated Zhou Guan-jun and Cai Bao-heng 6-0, 6-3.</p>
<p>Yesterday, China won two singles matches, while Japan only won one doubles match, which was the reason for the defeat. Zhang Dingzhao's victory over Isobe in the second singles match laid the foundation for the victory, as each side would win one of the remaining singles and doubles matches. Isobe was aggressive when he came on the court and won the first three games, but unfortunately, he lacked strength later. Zhang came from behind. The Chinese team's doubles pairing was not good. Liang Deguang was absent, and Cai Guo-heng was used instead, resulting in no resistance. Guo-heng made many mistakes and had unstable striking skills, which was not enough to be an international representative. Finally, in the singles match, Baba tried his best to resist Tao Guan-qiu, but to no avail, and only won three games in the entire match.</p>

<p>At present, the National Government's policy places particular emphasis on strengthening the economic sector, and the biggest key to strengthening the central economic organization is to strengthen the organization of the National Economic Commission. Therefore, the commission will adjust its personnel and establish an Economic Survey Research Institute to explore the development of practical business. The establishment of this institute is of unlimited expectation for the National Government's economic policies. The purpose of assisting the National Government's economic policies is to actively investigate the national economic situation. The specific contents are recorded as follows: Investigate and study economic and political issues. Provide appropriate liaison and guidance to domestic economic survey research institutions and experts, and research and reward outstanding individuals. Establish a national economic survey research plan. The general outline of its internal organization is as follows:</p>
<p>Name: Economic Survey Research Institute.</p>
<p>One director and two deputy directors, appointed from among the members of the National Economic Commission.</p>
<p>Establish a councilor system. Councilors are selected from among the responsible persons and members of the National Economic Commission.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Opinions on the Food Problem—Special Issue Three—The Origin of the Food Problem <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Cuqian</p>
<p>When we speak of food, we usually refer to rice. However, those who wish to address the food problem should include all food and fuel.</p>
<p>The food problem should not have become a problem, nor should it be allowed to become one. Once it becomes a problem, people become anxious, and its fluctuations affect the entire society. The severity of its impact on the national economy and people's livelihood is unparalleled. And the solution must also be approached with caution.</p>
<p>Causes of the Problem</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, the causes of panic in the wartime food problem are due to:</p>
<p>The shrinking of cultivated areas. Firstly, vast areas in the front lines become battlefields, and the two armies are in contention, making it impossible to carry out agricultural activities on good farmland. Secondly, bandits and stray soldiers harass rural areas, and farmers' lives and agricultural products are not guaranteed, making it impossible for them to farm with peace of mind. The shrinking of cultivated areas directly affects the reduction of agricultural output.</p>
<p>The concentration of population. People retreat from the front lines to the rear, and from rural areas to cities. The safe areas in the rear invisibly absorb population and increase it significantly, disrupting the original natural laws of regulating surpluses and deficits. This situation is particularly evident in cities that rely on external supply, and panic is particularly severe.</p>
<p>The lack of rural labor. The supply of conscripts and the absorption of labor by military production departments lead to a large number of farmers leaving the countryside. During the busy farming season, it is difficult to hire short-term workers, and wages are exorbitant, which naturally reduces agricultural output.</p>
<p>Inconvenient transportation. The exchange of urban industrial products and agricultural products depends entirely on convenient transportation. However, the requisition of transportation tools during wartime, the blockade and isolation of strategic areas, and the oppression of good people by bandits and thugs all hinder convenient and safe transportation, resulting in cities lacking agricultural products and rural areas lacking industrial products.</p>
<p>Military supply. Military victory depends on various conditions, and an uninterrupted supply of grain is one of the main conditions. Large-scale purchases and reserves are inevitable, making the already insufficient agricultural products even more scarce.</p>
<p>Solutions</p>
<p>The analysis above is roughly correct. In response to this, the countermeasures are: Develop cultivated land. All available open spaces that can be used for cultivation should be utilized to the greatest extent possible to increase the cultivated area. After clearing rural areas and ensuring good order and security, farmers should be encouraged to return to their farms, so that cultivators have a place to use their skills, and the land is used to its full potential, so that output can naturally increase.</p>
<p>Disperse the urban population. Since farmers have returned to the countryside, those who do not need to stay in the city should also be moved to the countryside, so that the population ratio between urban and rural areas is not too different, which will reduce the severity of the urban food problem.</p>
<p>After developing cultivated land, returning farmers to the countryside, and dispersing the urban population, the surplus labor in the cities can be used for agricultural work, so that the supply and demand of labor can be properly adjusted. If people are used to their full potential, the food problem can also be partially solved.</p>
<p>Facilitate transportation and ensure safety. On the one hand, all existing transportation tools should be organized and properly controlled to ensure their full utilization. The government should also strengthen medical and health services to maintain the safety of the routes. On the other hand, friendly nations should be consulted to assist in smoothing the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, so that goods flow freely and needs are met, which will benefit the food problem.</p>
<p>For military supply, it is best to specify the quantity and delineate the area, stating how much each area should bear within a certain period. If there is a shortage, it should be compensated by allocations from neighboring areas. In this way, food can be obtained locally, which avoids procurement issues and provides a clear understanding of the production and sales volume of each area, allowing for confident adjustment and distribution.</p>
<p>The above are the main methods to solve the wartime food problem.</p>
<p>The Issue of Increasing Production</p>
<p>In addition, there are several issues worth discussing. One is the issue of increasing food production.</p>
<p>China's agricultural economy is a small-scale peasant production system, and production methods and tools are Asian and primitive, which is a major obstacle to technological improvement and increased production. Model farms and demonstration farms should be established, and scientific methods and new facilities should be used to improve technology, so that farmers can learn from them and increase production. The government should also announce a plan to encourage production. Those whose harvests exceed the standard should be rewarded; those who invent or improve agricultural production techniques and tools should also be given preferential rewards.</p>
<p>School authorities should supervise students to go to the fields and make it a compulsory extracurricular activity. Schools with campuses or sports fields should be converted into farms to grow vegetables and raise livestock to provide students with side dishes. Public places should also be used as farms, and the planting of all non-essential agricultural products, such as tobacco, should be prohibited.</p>
<p>Agricultural tools should be sold to farmers at a fair and reasonable price. Bean cakes are as expensive as one or two hundred yuan, and fertilizer powder is rationed in small quantities, making fertilization difficult. Efforts should be made to reduce the price and increase the ration appropriately to reduce the cost of agricultural products.</p>
<p>The Issue of Rationing</p>
<p>The second is the issue of food rationing. Every city should implement public sales based on the county as a unit. The quantity and price of rations should take into account the affordability of the people; the household registration survey should be detailed and accurate, and false reports and exaggerations should not be allowed; the amount of private storage should be regulated, and those who exceed the quota should be punished. Rationing should also be timed and quantified to reassure the people. Those who handle the rations and have the evil behavior of deducting rations should be encouraged to report and severely punish them. Furthermore, large-scale agricultural product warehouses and cold storage warehouses should be operated by the public to regulate surpluses and deficits, in order to facilitate procurement and storage. All competent government agencies related to food should be aware of "not worrying about scarcity but worrying about inequality," and they should communicate with each other and closely coordinate to achieve orderly progress and fair and equitable distribution of food.</p>
<p>The Issue of Consumption</p>
<p>Third, the issue of food consumption. The people should be aware of the inevitable shortage of food during wartime. They should change the habit of overeating to reduce consumption. It is enough to just fill the stomach, and there is no need to overeat and hurt the stomach.</p>
<p>Because the amount of rice per household is too small, the general residents have gradually become accustomed to using miscellaneous grains to fill their stomachs, and have corrected the idea that rice is the only necessary staple food. This trend should be popularized and actively promoted to reduce rice consumption.</p>
<p>To reduce rice consumption, brewing alcohol and wine lees should be prohibited. For fine and exquisite cakes, teas, and foods that are not made from fruits, heavy taxes should be levied. The scale of social banquets should be re-determined, and progressive tax rates should be applied. The more expensive the dishes, the higher the tax rate should be. The substantial tax revenue can be used to run public canteens, provide affordable rations of various foods and fuel, and issue food coupons and canteen coupons to facilitate the majority of middle and lower-class citizens.</p>
<h3 id="e53">The Adjustment and Strategy of Shanghai's Food Rationing Agency (II) <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Chuisheng</p>
<p>The Unevenness of Food Distribution "Waves"—The food distribution system can generally be divided into three types: one is the free trade system, one is the government's direct management and distribution system, and the other is the food coupon system. Of the above three systems, except for the first, the second and third are currently implemented in Shanghai, as described above. The so-called government direct management and distribution system is like the current Shanghai-organized Commercial Control Association or various rationing organizations, although these are organized by the people, government personnel are often behind the scenes. During the Great War, Germany organized the Wartime Nutrition Department and established the Public Welfare Wartime Materials Company as a supply mechanism, and later established the Imperial Grain Bureau. This organizational system is the same method as the Commercial Control Association today. As for the food coupon system, all countries have adopted it, and its popularity is no less than the principle of buying a ticket to enter a theater. However, the problem of food rationing quantity in Shanghai today is really serious. Although Jiangsu Province today does not need external supply of food, why do we allow our people to sigh about hunger and thirst? It must be known that the government should stipulate the minimum total amount of sacrifice for distribution and must not arbitrarily increase or decrease it.</p>
<p>Not only that, we also know that there are other factors that determine the amount of food consumption, such as the difference in food intake between men and women in rural areas and men and women in cities, and the difference in food intake between different ages, which are all of great importance. How many meals can Shanghai citizens actually fill their stomachs with the food they receive each period? The authorities should seriously consider this serious issue.</p>
<p>In addition, we should pay attention to the equal distribution of quantities among citizens. We must ask our authorities to implement a "treat everyone equally" policy and grant equal obligations to all Shanghai citizens.</p>
<p>Implementation of Food Consumption Savings—Increasing income and reducing expenditure is the obligation of all our citizens today. To supply the entire city with limited resources, we must strive for savings. However, the way to save is to have the people voluntarily implement it and to have the state implement it. Now, I will briefly describe it as follows:</p>
<p>Voluntary Savings by the People—In this time of life and death, if the people can understand the important relationship between food and war, they should voluntarily initiate clothing and food savings to meet the urgent needs of the country. Actively initiate a "Food Savings Movement" to spread to cities and towns across the country, with the aim of saving the amount of food, meat, sugar, oil, etc. used by the people in their families. And our government should first give encouragement and guidance. Order all educational institutions in the city, regardless of large, medium, or small schools, to give appropriate education during commemorative events, and not to arbitrarily waste general consumer goods, or to teach general store employees the common knowledge of saving for the people. To give citizens a scientific understanding of the value of food and its consumption in each family, and to implement it by means of newspapers and school lectures.</p>
<p>Distribute documents about food knowledge, the types of which can be divided into:</p>
<p>(A) How to avoid waste.</p>
<p>(B) What can be used for cooking.</p>
<p>(C) Comparison of the ingredients of brown rice and white rice.</p>
<p>(D) Soybeans contain rich vitamins.</p>
<p>(E) Drying methods for fruits and vegetables and their manufacturing processes.</p>
<p>(F) How to store sweet potatoes for a long time.</p>
<p>(G) Encourage citizens to grow vegetables in small gardens.</p>
<p>The above is the responsibility that Shanghai citizens should have today. Although Shanghai newspapers are promoting this initiative, its thorough spirit has not been seen. For example, restaurants, hotels, tea rooms, and cafes remain the same. So-called Western food costs hundreds of yuan per dish, and Chinese food costs more than a thousand yuan per table, which are all common occurrences and should be prohibited.</p>
<p>Mandatory Savings by the State; As mentioned above, looking at the spirit of self-government of Shanghai citizens today, if we want to save, I am afraid that its effectiveness cannot be fully realized, and as a result, the government has no choice but to make it necessary to force everyone to save consumption. If all our authorities are aware of this, they should quickly set a clear limit on all large and small restaurants and hotels, and the proportion per person should not exceed the government's publicly determined standard price, in order to embrace the spirit of sharing weal and woe and implement a consistent policy of "matching words with actions."</p>
<p>Strengthen the Control of Rationing Agencies—Since the food control policy is as described above, as for how to improve the health of the rationing agency, a food control and rationing agency must be established to make overall plans. The Shanghai City Front was composed of the Huazhong Grain Rationing Association, which allocated rice to the former Shanghai Municipal Council and the Municipal Grain Bureau, and then distributed it to registered stores for citizens to obtain with tickets. Since July of this year, it has been transferred to the Joint Venture, but because the organization is unsound, it has not been effective.</p>
<p>Looking at the examples of Europe, the matter of food control and rationing should be handled directly by the government. Now that our authorities have transferred it to private operation, it is conceivable. Therefore, the government should lend a helping hand to facilitate transportation and avoid the harm of miscellaneous taxes. As Mr. Zhang Yunbo said in the Sunday Review of the Shen Bao on September 5: "The tax rates and regulations are fixed, and they are not afraid of being responsible, but the checkpoints and inspection workers are as strict as a net, not letting a single thread slip through, and the amount may be doubled by the public. Criminals are even more manipulative and complicit, making rice prices rise higher and higher..." How can this be the trend of the times? Now, to adjust its sound structure, it may be briefly described below for the reference of those who are fighting.</p>
<p>Its organizational scope includes: Production Control Group. Consumption Control Group. Price Control Group, Distribution Control Group, Trade Control Group.</p>
<p>The duties of these five groups are to pay attention to the needs and supply and demand of food for citizens. Two-sixths of the members should be the current deans of Shanghai universities, and the employment of lower-level talents should be cautious.</p>
<p>Forcibly Disperse the Population The food problem is closely related to the size of the population. Today, the population of Shanghai has increased to more than five million. This increase has caused the food supply to gradually decrease. Therefore, the population must be forcibly dispersed. The country has created a class of dancing vagrants, which not only affects law and order but also endangers the people's food. Therefore, in the second household survey conducted by He Jia this time, close attention should be paid to these unemployed people and reported to the authorities. Our authorities should adopt a policy of forced return to the countryside to prevent these people from becoming parasites.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In discussing people and things, there is always something to discuss. Now, when discussing rice, it can prove the ancient people's foresight of "the people take food as their heaven." Today, in the city of Shanghai, the food problem is extremely important and is regarded as a serious matter. Therefore, all citizens must strive to be diligent and thrifty, save clothing and eat, and strive to stabilize their lives. Alas, if the people are not at peace, how can they be safe and undisturbed?</p>
