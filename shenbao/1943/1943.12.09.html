<p>代論</p>
<h3>我們的態度</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>昨天是大東亞戰爭二周年紀念，同時，也是本報復刊一周年之日，我們在這一年內，對於國家社會，甚至對於大東亞，愧無貢獻可言，可是，我們對於自始所持的態度，和一年來經過的事實相比對，坦白的反省一下，則尙無多大出入的地方。至於我們的態度是怎樣呢？約可歸納為下列數點：</p>
<p>新聞事業，是具有永久性質之事業，所以，應以超然的事業心經營，以奠立永恒的基礎。經常地為國計民生作正確之宣揚，而絕不是作政治上一時宣傳的工具。這是本報復刊以後對於辦報基本的觀點。</p>
<p>我們對於時局的熊度，擁護南京國民政府和平政策及國策，同時，協力盟邦完成大東亞戰爭勝利，以最近大東亞會議通過之大東亞宣言為政治最高理想。</p>
<p>我們立言的態度，悉以民意為依歸。民為國本，國家原是人民之集體。人民愛國之心，激發初非難事，且可說是與生俱來，其發揚與否？以及程度若何？全視乎當國者對於民意之重視如何？質直言之，當國者，茍重視民意而愛護人民，則人民安有不愛護政府愛護國家者。我們本於此義，對於民意絕對重視，一切立論，根據民意，表達民意，雖因此而對政府主張革新政治，不無率直之處，亦所不計。我們認為這種態度是對政府最摯誠的表示。因為，在今天的時代，虛偽的歌功頌德，旣不是我們所願說，也料不為賢明的當局所願聽的。其次，我們對於盟邦的立論態度，也完全相同，更進一步，我們素來主張盟邦方面如須談到眞正中日親善，則必先了解中國民意，如果不了解中國民意，則一切施策的基礎，無異建築在沙漠上面。我們常常取警意批評的立論，促起盟邦當局注意，中日兩國過去的痕跡，應該從切切實實的了解民意中改善。</p>
<p>我們對於重慶政權與中共的態度，反對依賴英美破壞中國的統一，反對拖戰陷人民於水火。然而尤其反對騎　主義的「兩棲動物」，什麽是「兩棲動物」呢？就是掛了一塊招牌，一面是重慶，一面却是南京或日本，憑薪手腕，偷天換日，混水撈魚。</p>
<p>一年以來，終以人力物力的限制，計劃做而未能做到的事情很多。中國的新聞事業，與先進國家比較，誠是瞠乎其後，但本報創刋巳七十戰，在歷史上却有悠久之地位。彬龢在此時會，適主本報，對於本報過去歷史與前人業績，固不敢僭竊；而對於當前責任，尤絕不諉却，但願中國新聞事業得能啓迎頭趕上之道，與先進國家並駕齊驅，則幸甚矣！</p>
<h3>紀念勝利第三年首相昨晚廣播　並赴靖國神社參加祈願祭</h3>
<p>日全國舉行必勝默禱</p>
<p>東京八日中央社電　自日本對英·美宣戰，於茲巳滿二年，全東亞民族銘記不忘之十二月八日，再度來臨，是日，日全國國民，均於上午十一時五十九分，分別於所在地點，作一分鐘之必騰默　，呼應前錢之大戰決意擊滅英美。東京自晨起，於宮城前祈念必勝之市民，即絡繹不絕，翼贊壯年團，則於平明時動員全國十四萬團員，分別於各地嚴肅舉行必勝祈禱，上午九時，於束京帝大禮堂舉行大詔捧讀式，日全國各大學，專門學校，亦均有此種儀式，祈禱日本必勝，並祝　征學生之武遝長久。日東條首相偕各閣際，陸，海軍代表部長及在鄉軍人將兵各種團體，曾於上午十時參加靖國神社舉行之「皇軍武運長久祈願祭」，對護國英靈祈念必勝，又東條首相於八日下午七時二十分，對日一億國民及東亞十億民衆，作紀念勝利第三年之重大廣播講演。</p>
<h3>東條首相廣播辭</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　日東條首相在大東亞戰爭二週年紀念日，八日下午七時二十分特於此問中央廣播電台向日本全國國民廣播，　請國民團結一致，共同奮鬥，爭取最後勝利。茲誌其原辭如次：</p>
<p>自前年十二月八日我國對英美宣戰以來，迄茲已屆二年，同顧兩年來我軍在御稜威之下，善謀勇戰，最近更乘敵人發動大模規反攻之良機，相繼收獲罕見之偉大戰果，刻正為爭取最後勝利，努力以赴，余於茲願與諸君對全綫將士之日夜苦鬥，深表謝忱，對陣亡之英靈謹致吊慰，並對國民諸君為爭取最後勝利，不辭勞苦，努力奮鬥，深表敬意。</p>
<p>盟邦緊密團結前途充滿光明</p>
<p>二年前之今日，我國為打開英美之經濟及軍事壓迫，圖我國之自有自衛計，唯有毅然執戈而起，所以我正義之師所向無敵，英美之侵略勢力即被掃蕩，驅出東亞以外，大柬亞各民族更崛然而起，大東亞各國家各民族即本諸兄弟之關係，加緊提携，使豐富之資源化為戰力，並為根據道義建設大東亞，乃共同努力以求完成共同目的。大東亞十億民族所具堅決之共同決意，復因最近舉行之火束亞會議更臻鞏固，以此與開戰前狀况相較，則知大東亞情勞巳完全一變，吾人之前途今已豁然而開充滿光明。他方歐洲盟邦戰意更趨吒盛，克服一切困難繼續奮門，我國與歐洲盟邦之提携亦日趨緊密，東四相互呼應，以粉碎英美之野望，並為完成建設世界新秩序之共同目標，繼續勇猛邁進。</p>
<p>指出開羅會議暴露制覇野心</p>
<p>反觀敵方英美指導老，動輒高呼正義人道博愛仁義，但其所為則與此完全相述，如其一再轟炸我醫院船之暴戾行為，實為人神所不許，彼等為謀自身之繁榮，不惜犧牲共他國家其他民族，對我東亞更一面高呼開放門戶機會均等，一面則在其國內對東亞各民族實施排斥政策，予以不平等之待遇。總之，彼等所求於東亞民族者，在為其永久之奴隸，最近英美指導者，曾在開羅舉行會談，擅論處置東亞，楊　將使。本降為三等國云，此足證彼等業已疲於作戰，對於前途深感不安，故圖掩飾當前之失敗，而對於多年未被彼等掠　之全世界地域及於彼等壓迫下之民族並未言及，蓋因彼等所求者，既非正義，又非人道，仍為榨取其他民族求其自私之繁榮，今日彼等又對渝方玩弄技倆，使其繼讀作無益之抗戰，其用意顯在永久離間大東亞各國家民族，淪東亞永為其殖民地，而完成其制霸束亞之野望，所謂開羅會談，不外向世界暴露其非望，及說明彼等戰爭目的何在。</p>
<p>愈益加強團結應付長期戰爭</p>
<p>彼等之理念與大東亞各國共同之崇高精神，全不相容，蓋大東亞各國共同之崇高精神，在與世界各爾敦篤邦交，取消人種之差別界限，溝通文化，進而開放資源，期對世界文化有所貢獻也。英美國民為橫暴無道之指導者所愚弄，所受戰爭之苦痛日形深刻，其懷疑此次戰爭目的係屬必然。而英美之指導者刻正積極行動，企圖遂其貪婪無厭之野望，於焦慮之餘，更一再發動頑强反攻，是固在預料中，故戰局將益形劇烈與長期化，吾入已夙抱決心，對擊戾之英美所採之手段，巳昭然若揭，敵人既圖以暴力遂其野望，則我人亦唯有以實力摧毀之，蓋隱忍自重巳達最大限度，為自存自衛起見，唯有執戈奮起。二年前之今日所下決心，恍如昨日，茲在必勝之信念下，愈益加强大東亞之團結，抱澈底擊減英美之決心，無論敵之反攻如何劇烈，決不有所介意，祇有毅然報之以格殺，更進而予以澈底痛擊，至彼等屈服為止。</p>
<p>一億民衆一心爭取最後勝利</p>
<p>蓋戰勝之道，決非可垂手獲得，要在一億國民於國內國外，各就本位及日常生活中傾舉一切，以盡報國之至誠、始可獲致也。勝利之關鍵即在我人自身手中，而素臻熱烈之忠誠，熱烈之闕魂，旺盛之減敵意志，即最後勝利之基礎。我一億同胞能團結一致，盡最善努力，以決死奮鬥，則最後勝利必在我人。諸君或前綫將士近在班根維爾吉爾貝特方面及華中方面奮戰決鬥克敵致果，收獲光輝戰果，實堪慶慰而感激，凡我將士均深明大義，不期生還，甘願　家離國開赴前綫。我人目睹國民各界所具愛國熱忱，益信勝利必屬於我也。我國內同胞今雖仍在後方，而心則在沙塲，誓貫敵戰時生活增强戰力。抱持久戰爭之信念，以爭第三年為決勝年，我人必可完成維護國家之卞途也。又日本一億國民之心，亦即大東亞十億民衆之心，故大東亞戰爭如不能完遂，即不能建設大東亞。大東亞十億民族能否安居樂業共在共榮，或再陷於英美之壓迫下，胥繫於此次大戰爭。我一億同胞與大東亞十億民族共同携手，期以完遂戰爭、完成建設，乃所必然。茲當大束亞戰爭第二周年紀念日，願與國民諸君一新二年前之決意，堅持必勝信念，誓爭取大東亞戰爭之最後勝利而後已。</p>

<h3>大東亞戰二週年結華軍事愈進展　日派遣軍當局昨發表談話</h3>
<p>南京八日中央社電　日駐華派遣軍當局，於大東亞戰爭二週年時，發表談話如下：</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭與中國戰綏。英美於開戰之初，慘遭敗北，知長期消耗戰之不利，乃獲極整備戰時態勢，力求反攻。目前正於南方海域及發展開激烈之決戰，英美除於南方海域之反攻外，並重視對日反攻一環之緬甸反攻，及由中國外陸之反攻，驅使渝方作澈底之抗戰，並企圖以駐渝美空軍直接空襲日本土，及切斷海上運輸。惟渝方自絕望於自力抗戰後，即竭力將其抗戰希望，繫諸依賴英美，夢想反軸心國之勝利，容許英美把握統帥指揮權，及空軍之跋扈。乃至經濟上之再被侵略，繼續其妄動，因之中國大陸作戰之現階段，逐漸呈複雜深刻之現象。中國戰綫在大東亞戰爭中之地位，亦更形重要。在大東亞戰爭第二年中，日本駐華派遣軍，不僅從事其原有任務擊滅渝軍，及對共軍展開積極之掃蕩作戰，且對渝美空軍之　動，先發制人，封鎖其所謂對日本土之空襲。</p>
<p>日駐華派遣軍一年東之戰果。日駐華派遣軍一年來之至要作戰，有華北之春夏太行山作戰，秋季剿共作戰，華中之大別山作戰，春季及夏季進攻作戰，太湖西南地區作戰華南之進駐廣州灣廣九路沿綫地區作戰，及現在展開之長扛上游地區進攻作戰等。其他蒙疆及華中華南華北亦不斷展開積極活動。今舉其大概之戰果如次：（甲）交戰次數約二二〇〇〇次，每月平均一九〇〇次，每日平均約六七次，較前年之二五〇〇〇次，略有減少。且軍發動次數與去年不相上下，由是而觀，足證渝軍在極力迴避作戰。（乙）交戰兵力，總計約三三〇〇〇〇〇人，較前年之三六〇〇〇〇〇人，略於減少，其原因當然不外前項所述渝軍之力求迥避作戰，但另一方面並可證明渝軍兵力補給之困難。（丙）渝軍陣亡約二一〇〇〇〇人，被俘及歸頗者約二〇〇〇〇〇人，後者對前者之比率，為百分之九五，但該比率在民國二十九年為百分之一二，民國三卞年為百分之二九，民國三十一年為百分之四四。由是而觀，在最近一年內，俘　及歸順之人數巳有極大增加。但以往多為局部散漫之歸順投降，現變為集團地域之歸順。實因渝方治下軍民巳覺悟抗戰之非計，並足證渝軍戰力之低落。（丁）日軍截獲兵器中大砲重火器等，較以前減少，但刺刀肯龍刀等則反增多，足證大束亞戰爭後，渝軍因援路被切斷，主要兵器之補充不足，故其裝備漸形低落。</p>
<p>情勢。（甲）渝方。渝方自大東亞戰爭爆發後，由於內外情勢之惡化，致經濟危機，民心消沉等弱點，相繼暴露。但渝方仍妄想英美獲得勝利，俾於世界戰局吿終時，獲其勝利。故　外則唯知獻媚英美，對內則避免軍事上之消耗，着重於內部建設，致力於解決抗戰經濟之困窘。同時對於其內部建設，着重開發邊境一達。於此足見渝方之所謂抗戰建國及戰後經營，其中雖含有弱點盛多，但仍以任意妄行。同時對英美在東亞之反攻作戰無表示，擬予以協力，但鑒於以往於緬甸戰綫所受之打擊，故於此次奪囘緬甸作戰中，仍有不安之感。（乙）渝共關係。渝方因蘇　宜布解散第三國際時，曾利用時機，對中共增加壓迫，致於各地引起渝共間之衝突。其雙方對立程度之深刻，實為以往所未有。渝方要求中共反省，聲稱希望作政治上解決企圖，制止中共之鋒芒，同時並採所有方策，以期抑制乃至破壞中共於物心兩方面擴大共勢力。中共方面於第三國際解散後竭力防止內部發生動搖，同時對於渝方則始終作武力抗爭之示威。實則雙方對於解決當前之渝共問題所作之努力，均期其有利於己而已，如此渝共兩方於近代中國革命史上，已幾經分合，現仍繼續其醜惡之無名鬥爭。（丙）駐渝美空軍。駐渝美空軍足以反映美國積極的對日反攻之意圖，此即為本年奪月在駐印美空軍之指揮下，由捷諾德少將為司令，以陸軍第十四航空隊而獨立，其後在人力物力兩方面，積極增强。前年曾有活　之出擊，但我方航空部隊常制宜進先作戰，故迄今為止，猶不能逞其呼號空龔日本本土之企圖。迨至最近，又以渝方空軍之一部，歸入其指揮之下，設立美渝混合空軍部隊，逐漸顯示由美空軍支配渝空軍之悄勢。同時又欲在最近將來，美空軍本身作飛躍的增强，以此欲空襲我戰土，及遮斷海上運輸綫，此應嚴密注視與警戒者。　結論。在此大東亞戰爭第二年中，中國戰綫已逐漸改變其狀態，愈益增加大東亞戰爭一環之重要性。巳如上述，而於戰爭第三年中，渝方不了解我國之眞意，但估我方之實力，而繼續其抗戰方針。雖渝方將極力避免軍事的消耗，採用游擊戰術，以擾亂後方治安工作。美國為達到其制期東亞之野心，正積極企岡自中國戰綫方面，舉行反攻。同時窺機空襲日本本土之益急，此亦不難明瞭。自上述各點而言，在大東亞戰爭第三年中，中國戰綫之情勢，實不可輕視。我國對渝方之戰略態勢，北自蒙　，經華北華中華南越南泰國以至緬甸，形成蜿蜓四千公里之包圍陣綫。而其中各個戰略上重要據點，悉在我軍手中，故隨時隨地予以痛擊。所謂率師深入，制其死命，在我軍戰略下，絕非難事。又對美空軍，現其主要基地，悉在我軍勢力圈內，為覆滅其基地，擊滅其勢力，我軍巳完成一切準備，此為最明者。躉派遣戒堅持既定方針，愈益昻揚其士氣，强化其戰力與戰備，奮其全力，以期擊毀橫於大東亞戰爭遂行途上之一切抗戰勢力。</p>

<h3>國府宣戰佈吿</h3>
<p>前年十二月八日大東亞戰爭發動之始，國民政府根據中日基本關係條約之精神，聲明決與友邦日本同甘共苦，自是以來，著手新國民運動，從事保障治安，襲等民生。期於增進國力，協助大東亞戰爭之完遂。乃英美等國仍沿用其百年以來分裝束亞之政策，且變本加厲，竟勾引渝方分子，參加所謂英美戰綫，出兵緬印，以東亞人殘殺東亞人，最近因其暴力巳次第為友邦日本陸海空軍所擊破，侵略束亞之根據地亦巳喪失，乃益逕狡謀。且嫉視國民政府統治區域之和平發展，　使渝方分子不斷侵擾，以阻撓各種建設之進行，並逕以自國飛機，藉渝方為根據，向我武漢廣州等處屢施轟炸，殘害平民，在渝方分子，甘受英美驅使，躬為東亞叛遂，固屬可恥：而英美對於東亞處心積慮，盡其挑撥離間之能事，以圖遂其最後併吞之欲，尤為東亞民族所當同仇敵愾，國民政府為此宣吿，自今日起，對英美處於戰爭狀　，當悉其全力，與友邦日本協力，一掃英美之殘暴，以謀中國之復興，東亞之解放。滿泰兩國，夙敦友好，對於東亞共榮，尤具同心，今後當益謀提携，以期共同建設以道義為基礎之東亞新秩序。德義諸友邦，數年以來，在西方與英美勢力周旋，迭獲勝利之光榮，我國今茲參加大東亞戰爭，當相與呼應，以期對於世界全體之公正的新秩序有所貢獻，凡我國民，當知此為實現國父大亞洲主義之唯一時會，中華民國之復興，大東亞共榮建設之實現，世界全體止義和平之獲得，胥繫於此。其一德一心，戮力始終，以貫徹此偉大時代之偉大使命！</p>

<h3>前田中將談話</h3>
<p>南京八日中央社電　日駐華海軍武官前田稔中將，於茲大東亞戰爭二周年紀念，特發表談話，大意如次：二年前之今日，大詔頒發，繼即有夏威夷海戰，空襲菲鳥，馬來上陸等大戰果發表，日本國民之士氣，可謂空前。茲又當南太平洋屢獲大戰果之時，逢此大東亞戰爭二周年紀念日，實深欣快。蓋敵性各國數百年來侵略束亞之野心，自開戰後，未及半年，即為日軍相繼　滅。現在到處均為各民族共存之所，並進行各國家之共榮建設。以協力完遂戰爭。自大東亞會議後，愈加强東亞民族之團結，然此時敵方反攻之勢，亦決不能輕視。藍現正展開壯絕之海戰，由玻根維爾，吉爾貝特等方面戰况觀之，即可知敵方正力圖反攻，不顧莫大之犧牲，而出死力作戰，以是戰局實甚嚴重。吾人無論如何，必需擊滅英美，徹底　懲彼等之妄念。此次戰設兩方均大獲成果，在今日總力戰中，無分前綫後方，無分內外，每人均處於第一綫，應各就本位。以東亞十億人民之力，團結一致，東亞之通路，已如前次大東亞宣言所明示者，但前途尙遠而多難。將來亦未容樂觀，今日惟有奮力向此光明努力邁進，以恢復東亞本然之姿態。東亞問題，雖極複雜分歧，但其核心實為中日兩國，此兩國不緊密一致。即不能為東亞團結之中樞。故為完遂戰事為戰後建股，中日國交之應依同盟條約，確立永久友好基礎，實至重要。此事雖須俟兩國國民之眞誠自覺、及互相積極理念。但旅華日僑之努力本位工作，實至為重大，吾人處於當地最要者，即在本位上貢獻於完遂戰爭，注視長久之過去及現實，覺知此尙非容易。然吾人必須正視將來，努力奮起，國與國之關係，為人與人之問題，事　成否，係於人之眞心如何。在國家在國民，其永久不變之親陸，實基於相互相賴之誠。吾人必須以在神前眞摯謙虛之心意，待人接物，則必能有相互信賴與敬愛之念。又現地有力，則人更應以如前綫將士勇戰之精神，一心一體，對中國四億國民，盡其誠意。余深望於來年此日時，能目見此種悄形云。</p>

<h3>土總統在開羅　與羅邱晤談　並無軍事代表參加</h3>
<p>瑞典京城八日中央社電　海通社訊，英駐開羅訪員發出消息稱：羅斯福與邱吉爾在開羅巳與土耳其總統伊斯美進行會議，互相交換關於德黑蘭會議之意見。英外相艾登，美代表　浦金與土外長曼奈門卓格魯亦皆參加是項討論。</p>
<p>安加拉八日中央社電　據海通社訊：土耳其繼統伊斯美昨日午後尙未返抵土京，但已在阿達那至土京之途中矣，據接近土國內閣總理之人士稱，特沙馬克上將，並未隨伊斯美赴開羅，除總統之副官外，並無軍事代表參加開羅會議，關於開羅會議並未討論軍事問題之推測，殆屬正確，按英國人士曾申言開羅會議，並非阿達那會議之繼續，阿達那會議以軍事為主要討論事項。土國政界消息靈通人士以為伊斯美已獲德黑蘭會議各項決議與結果之報吿，伊斯美之訪問殆係羅斯福所建議，開羅會議因德黑蘭會議公報　請各國參加對德戰事而益見重要。伊斯美或將於今日向內閣特別會議報吿訪問開羅之經過。</p>
<p>柏林方面保持緘默</p>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　據海並社訊：德外部昨仍避不闡明對所傳土總統伊斯美與羅邱二氏進行會談之態度。發言人指稱，土耳其報章雖已發表共觀感，但土官塲方面尙未發表文告。土報巳力言土耳其之中立政策，乃由土總統·政府·與國民議會之同意而決定，常無加以改普之理由。</p>

<p>德報評論伊朗會議</p>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　據海通社訊：此間各報評論德黑蘭會議公報，以為此次會議實為政治之失敗，各項討論均受斯達林之控制，羅斯福與邱吉爾不得不遵循斯達林之意向云。「柏林夜報」戰稱，此次公報甚為節短，並無驚人之處，吾人巳預料參加會講者將向小國呼籲，渠等將繼續對小國使用壓力，因羅斯福不能空手歸國也。德黑蘭會議與最近史　　關於小國前途之　勵，實為企圖獲致小國信任之最不適當之措置，可以觀為政治之失敗。</p>
<p>伏羅希洛夫傳將訪英商軍事計劃</p>
<p>里斯本八日中央社電　據海並社訊：華盛頓消息：蘇聯伏羅布洛夫上將行將防問倫敦之消息，使美國人士愈加相信進攻西歐之日期巳近。衆料伏羅希洛夫上將之使命，為與英美參謀總長共同商定進攻計劃。</p>

<h3>卡米諾山地　爭奪戰激烈　義戰局重心移西部</h3>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　據海通社訊，反軸心軍於星期一在南義戰綫，破靑靜之空氣，英第八軍與美第五軍同時參加進攻，戰事之重心仍在兩翼，美軍在西翼以大量之軍隊，於砲火準備後進攻戰綫各點，其主要之目標在蒙特卡米諾，苦戰竟日，敵軍得在山區獲得若干立足點。蒙特卡米諾位於加里格里亞諾河東岸，德軍主要陣綫之前哨。美軍現擁守新得之陣地，以擋德軍之反攻。亞平靑中部之局勢未變，敵軍在該區東部屢攻奧索那未逞，亞特里亞海岸英軍抵達摩洛河各點，英第八軍在東翼之壓力不及美軍在西翼之堅強，此殆由於英軍重砲不及運抵前方之故。大雨與德軍之地雷陣地，使運輪陷於檉大困難。</p>
<h3>貝當聲明　繼續秉政</h3>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　據海通社訊，德外部發言人昨答外籍記者之詢問稱，德官方對貝當上將，發表將繼續當政之聲明，並無所知，此項聲明與現狀並無抵觸之處。該發言人又稱，法政府首　賴伐爾亦參加貝當上將與德大使阿培　之談話，關於其他詳情則未透露。</p>

<p>斯丹埠八日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：土耳其總理薩拉卓格魯即將於每年一度之儲蓄週發表演說，其日期已定於木月十二日。土政界極重視此次之演說，蓋料其將論及土耳其與世界大局之關係也。</p>
<h3>德國內陣線　決不動搖　郭培爾發表演說</h3>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　海通社訊：德國宣傳部長郭培爾昨在此間「德國鐵路工人節」所召開之大會中，發表演說稱，恐怖威脅或諾言，皆不足以消沉德國之民氣與其抵抗力，在任何環境之下、德國內陣綫決不分裂，吾人對德黑蘭會議之意見唯此而已。吾人之敵人並不向德國人民發表呼籲，因彼等深知此項呼籲決難收效，郭氏最後對德國鐵路工人在困難時期之功績，表示謝意。並稱，無論有條件或無條件之投降，皆不為德國人民之接受。</p>
<h3>敵方總反攻的崩潰日本大本營海軍報道課長陸軍報道課長對談（二）</h3>
<p>戰果與戰局的關係</p>
<p>松村大佐　戰果與戰局不同，這在海軍方面說，亦是如此。茲將敵方的反攻粗枝大略地作一概觀。羅斯福曾在其覺書中說：「對於日本，必須同時從各方面反復攻擊其國防圈各點。」奎貝克會談後，邱吉爾曾在議會中報告英軍在緬甸發動。十月七日瑪溫脫巴登至新德里就任東南亞總司令後，最近或赴渝訪蔣，或飛開羅參加會議，有種種活動。雨季終了後，因以前曾有阿拉干的悲劇，所以今日的準館極其愼重將事，建築飛行場，鋪設道路，徵集船隻，稱紮穩打，步步為營，而緬甸的轟炸也日益激烈。據今日的情勢看，瑪溫脫巴登反攻似在本年末或來年初。至於第二路反攻，則是麥克沃塞反攻，此以澳洲為中心，指向新幾內亞，所羅門方面。正如先前海軍方面田代君所發警吿，現在茶摩爾，安汶，亞里伯等地正常受　察，並時有十餘架飛機的空襲。此外，則是尼米茲反攻，這路係指向吉爾伯特方面。其目的所在，正如諾克斯所說，便是進攻馬歇爾羣島和縮短美澳連絡綫。總之，以印度·太平洋為舞台，恰如羅斯福覺書中所述及，進入戰爭第二年時，將同時受到來自三方面的强力反攻，這顯然可以預期。</p>
<p>栗原大佐　實際確實如此。我曾以為雨季一終緬甸反攻總會來了，焉知結果竟是「祇聽樓梯響不見人下來」，但其問在新幾內亞·所羅門·吉爾伯特方面·戰記倒相當活潑，可喜的是，如大本營歷次的發表，在波根維爾方面，從波根維爾島洋面海戰及第一次到第五次止的航空戰止，業已擊沈擊燬航空母艦·戰艦·巡洋艦等多艘，對於敵機也已給與相當打擊。待那方面的情形稍靖，他們對吉爾伯特方面的反攻又開始了，幸而對敵方艙隊也加以相當打擊。這路反攻的目的，正如剛在所說，是在壓迫馬歇爾羣島方面，他們宣稱這是攻擊日本本土的第一步，且可縮短美澳連絡綫云。可是，我方的戰果，像你也知道，實是夏威夷珍珠灣以來的大戰果。然而敵方的反攻波根維爾島，對於所謂太平洋方面的戰局，實有非常重大的影響。</p>
<p>這就是說，在航空基地的爭奪戰中，航空基地的獲得是非常重要的問題。同樣，對於吉爾伯特方面，敵軍在泰拉瓦島和瑪金島上陸，此舉的確非同小可，這一點，我想正是非仔細放慮戰果與戰局不可的問題。</p>
<p>馳援困難的上陸點</p>
<p>松村大佐　我們在戰術上雖給他們嚴重的打擊，但在戰略上他們却推進了基地，這眞是　　萬分的。實際上，身從瓜達爾卡拿爾島大戰以來，他們在倫特巴·新喬治亞·波根維爾等地都巳作過這種　試，其方式是完全相同的，編成航空母艦集團，在轟炸和艦砲射擊的掩護下登陸。而其上陸地點則選擇日軍配備極稀薄的部分，這次在波根維爾島方面，海軍雖予以相當打擊，但漏網的敵軍還是偷偷登陸了。該方面的戰事狀說所以不大妙，就因為所羅門羣島各島人口極稀，文化落後，島上簡直沒有一條像樣的路。就是在波根維爾島上，在托洛基拿上陸地點附近，日軍駐守部隊亦不多，並受到猛烈的艦砲射擊和轟炸，但生存者仍舊奮力抵拒，擊沈敵軍上陸用舟艇數十般。美軍上陸了的托洛基拿，兩側是異常的濕地帶，背後則是山岳，並且密生叢林。因而頗難用卡車裝戴大部隊適時馳抵敵軍上陸地點，壓迫他們，使他們在岸上立足不住。當力於建築飛機場，並且還配備了相當數量的飛機。正如他們自己也說：「進擊是困難的。」陸上的進擊似平沒有多大希望，他們大約是想在那裹作成飛行基地，藉以妨窖日本的給養。換言之，便是所謂補給戰。</p>
<p>在一個島上作成了航空基地，則和他處的連結，補給便發生因難的事，並不是在這次洋上島嶼爭奪戰中才見的。在那種一方公里人口不足一人的未開化地點，連像樣的道路也沒有，沿岸的述絡單靠小舟，所以增援部隊不能立即趕到上陸地點因而我方接獲敵軍上陸托洛基拿的報告後，疾行赴緩的部隊在二十公里的密林內足足走了兩天，敵軍在此期間乃得起卸大砲戰車，鞏固其陣地，在岸上生根。並築成飛機場，於是飛機的威力圈向北推進。</p>
<p>建立基地的目的</p>
<p>波根維爾島美軍的空軍司令杜亞寗宣稱，美軍如在托洛基拿生根，則日軍既不能夠撤退，又無方法補給，因此地們祗求取得島上一點。他們似乎致海軍雖立下那稱大的戰功，其問仍不免有漏過的敵軍上了陸生了根。</p>
<p>栗原大佐　是呀。實際上，切斷敵軍給養綫確實最為緊要，我們現正努力切斷托洛基拿上陸的敵軍補給。可是這一件工作、在劇烈的航空戰中取勝，並且把握征空海權，仍是必要的。因此，務須擁有相當數量的飛機。結果，我想問題仍是飛機的數量。</p>
<p>飛機數與制空權</p>
<p>松村大佐　是呀。結局仍是飛機的問題。那方面每日的大部分時間如在此方的制空權下，定可使勁兒尅制他們啦。</p>
<p>栗原大佐　眞是，眞是。由此可知飛機數量問題確是非常重大的問題。要之，握取制空權是要相當數量的飛機的。雙方飛機邂　時，擊墜了若干敵機的友方飛機，由於燃料及其他關係，不得不飛返基地。此時，如果飛機架數多，則在一部分飛機為補充而歸還基地時，就可另派一批生力空軍出動，這樣便可始終握取制空權了。</p>
<p>美國的作戰方式，全憑絕對優勢的數量。所以雙方飛機碰頭時，雖然趕走了美機，但因限於飛機的性質，並不能長久滯留空中，結果也非歸返基地不可。因此，縱然取得制空權，在一日之中也不過是極少的幾個小時，結果在這段時間以後，對方却派出生力軍來活動了。</p>
<p>所以，無論如何，制空權是握在飛機架數多的一方的。由於這個綠故，補給戰也不能盡如理想。想到這種事情時，關於飛機的增產，尙望國民更認眞些。</p>
<p>松村大佐　實際上，海軍旣已克服薄　，黎明等困難條件，打擊美國海軍，破壞敵方航空兵力，所以祗要有同等的航空勢力，制空權就屬於我們了。可是，由於敵方飛機多，一日中大部分時間的制空權落於對方之手，以致補給等等，也發生非常的困難。要倒轉這種狀態，攔截敵軍反攻，擊潰敵方，無論如何總希望有更多的飛機。</p>
<p>栗原大佐　正是。對極啦！</p>
<p>南方空戰的一般</p>
<p>松村大佐　美空軍的攻擊要領，在新幾內亞和所羅門，大體都取集團的攻擊方法，專恃數量，分批來襲，一批攻擊隊返去後，隔了二、三小時，又有相當架數飛來了，這樣輪流不息地幹着，因而此方最初雖翱翔上空，防其來襲，並和他們展開空中戰，但是等到後來因為汽油用聲，彈藥不夠，不得不降下來；這時，敵方的生力軍已飛來攻擊了，作戰當然會非常困難不利。而且，敵方還派了許多偵察機，沒飛各處，一發現良好目標，就用無錢「縱有時機奈無飛機何！」總之，機會是常常有的，可惜沒有抵住機會實行的飛機。南方戰綫的狀態就是這樣的悲壯！</p>
<p>他們的地上部隊，並無積極的攻擊精神，憑數量，專賴徹底的轟炸和火力，估取一角之後，即行建造飛機塲，不絕將飛機運來，用以切斷補給綫。在那方面的戰鬥中，我方將士決不輸給他們，祗是補給漸漸不濟，因而雖未戰敗，仍不得已地轉移陣地，的確扼，之至！這是瓜達爾卡拿爾以來所經騐着在的那方的戰綫上，士兵每日遭受敵軍的轟炸，結果，據最近歸國的將校談稱，前綫將士對已方的飛機十分担憂，發出「日本飛機究竟怎麼啦？」的呼聲。總而言之，祗要有飛機，就可將他們逼囘去。飛機，飛機，要飛機哪！</p>
<p>美機的生產額</p>
<p>栗原大佐　其次，關於美國飛機生產狀况，也請松村大佐談一談。</p>
<p>松村大佐　美國在緒戰中慘收後，即將汽車工廠的大部分改為飛機的轉包工工廠，並且添設飛機工廠，猛然　造飛機和艙船，利用存貯的原料及工業力，拚命努力，於是高喊反攻反攻。今年，羅斯福覺書中聲稱飛機的生產額為十二萬五千架，但實際上是九萬架內外，大約是八萬到九萬吧。</p>
<p>栗原大佐　九萬架大致不會錯吧。</p>
<p>松村大佐　前幾天據新從布諾斯艾里斯歸國的朝日新聞社細川君稱，敵方因未樹立物資動負計畫，隨手幹着，所以資材方面發生畸形狀態，勞務問題情勢尤見惡劣，以致生產方面的上昇角度自今夏以來漸形减少。在這以前，雖然急速上昇，值今年夏秋間頗有停滯之狀。（吉：譯自十二月四日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>大東亞戰二週紀念　舉行慶祝儀式　到各國民衆代表二千餘人</h3>
<p>中央社訊昨日為大東亞戰爭二週紀念日，對此含有重大歷史性之紀念日，大東亞戰爭二週年紀念行事委員會，特於昨（八）日下午三時假本巿靜安寺路大光明大戲院舉行共榮圈各國代表慶　儀式，到有陳市長公博，盟邦田尻公使，德國總領事飛師爾，滿洲國總領事葉堯公，及永津陸軍部長。日海軍武官府近藤少將，日本大使館廣田情報課長，曁各國民衆，中日德滿菲緬泰印等八國代表等二千餘人，盛况空前熱烈，三時正大會閒始，由日田尻公使，陳市長，及德總領事飛師爾，滿總領事葉堯公，及永津陸軍部長，近藤海軍少將先後致辭畢，大會　式即行吿終，會後並放映「大東亞民族大團結」及「大東亞戰爭」二週紀念文化電影」等新聞片，至六時始行散會。</p>
<p>田尻公使致詞</p>
<p>今日欣　大東亞戰爭二週年紀念目，舉行紀念盛典，中華民國，滿洲國，德國，曁大東亞各國代表均出席參與，本人覺得非常光榮，大東亞戰爭在此二年中之成績，巳將英美時略勢力逐出於大束亞天地，實現解放大東亞而大東亞即進入建設之階段，日本與中華民國締結中日同盟條約，確立永久的友好關係，日本與滿洲國間一心一德的關係，亦益趨深刻，更在南方，日本泰國之締盟愈鞏固，隨新生緬甸國之後，非律賓亦吿誕生，而印度完成獨立之日，亦不在遠。前在東京舉行之大東亞會議，巳發揚十億大東亞民族在鞏固團結下提携，完遂大東亞戰爭建設新秩序之決意，大東亞共同宣言、可謂為建設大東亞新秩序之大憲章，確信建設新的大東亞，因此項宣言今後益將邁開巨步前進，如此可期在大東亞戰爭之第三年，大東亞建設更有飛躍發展，擊減英美必可成功。吾人再顧歐洲戰綫、盟邦德國正在發揮驚異的戰鬥力，擊潰反軸心戰綫、同時歐洲新秩序之建設，日見進展吾人對盟邦之大戰果及百折不院的戰意，表示深切敬意，值茲大東亞戰爭二週年紀念，期望大東亞民族更鞏固團結，加緊與盟邦德國之提携，決意完成大東亞戰爭，獲得最後勝利而後巳。</p>
<p>陳市長致辭</p>
<p>諸位先生：今天是大東亞戰爭二週年紀念會，也可以說是大東亞戰爭的勝利預祝會，現在雖然戰事還沒有終結，但是在大東亞全體而言，英美勢月巳是排除　盡了，緬甸，菲律賓巳經獨立了，馬來和爪哇的人民巳取得參政權了，自由印度的臨時政府已成立了，印度三萬餘萬的被壓迫民族巳有解放的曙光了，就中國而言，所有租界巳收同了，在華的治外法權巳撤廢了，中日同盟條約巳訂定了，辛丑條約巳廢止了，不平等條約巳廢除了。所以在目前雖然大東亞的戰爭還未終了，而大東亞各民族的解放，巳將次完成，戰事雖然未完，而戰爭實質巳經勝利，我所以喚今天的紀念會，是大東亞戰爭的勝利預祝會。</p>
<p>今天參加這個紀念會，有大東亞各國的人民，有各同盟國的代表，因此我對諸位致詞，單就中國的立塲發言，也單就巾國的一般悄形去加以檢討，我們加強參戰的力量，確定我們的方向。</p>
<p>第一，中華民國在本年一月九日參加大東亞戰爭，這個意義是非常重大的，我們的參戰，不僅是為要求自巳解放而參戰，也是為要求東亞全民族解放而參戰。現在中國的租界全收同來，治外法權也撤消，中國的不平等條約巳不存在，中國的解放是實現了。然而我們中國對於這次參戰，究竟努過多少力，我們應該自己檢討，我們對於大東亞戰爭，還沒有派兵上前綫，但是我們是要準備的，我們不希望空名參戰，我們是希望實力參戰，因此我希望我們民衆們加緊組織。加緊訓練，使有事時，隨時執干戈，以赴疆塲，在後方時能夠維持秩序，確立治安，作一切心要的準備。</p>
<p>第二，我們不僅是自己要求獨立，更進一步要求東亞各民族的獨立，緬甸和菲律賓是已獨立了，我們應該予以支持，印度的臨時政府也成立了，我們更應該極力支持。前次自由印度臨時政府主席鮑斯來華，就是希望中國予以同情，予以援助，我承認印度一天不能獨立，大東亞的民族解放，還沒有完成，印度倘然一　還在英美的手裏，大東亞各民族的危機，依然存在。我喚起中華民國的國民，對於印度予以極度有力的協助。如果有全張和英美合作，以催殘印度自由的，我們應該制止，應該撲滅，且我更喚起流雌在印度的淪方士兵，立刻起來協同　斯的軍隊對英美作戰，以完成大東亞全民族的解放。</p>
<p>第三，我們旣　參戰，應當努力於本身的責任，尤其應當發揮本身的能力。力量是由於集中而來的，因此我們更須統一中國，我所謂統一，一方面是指全面和平、而一方面、尤共致力　國民政府下的政治統一，軍事統一，經濟統一。要求國家統一是任何一個國民的責任，也是任何一個國民的權利，我們唯有集中力量、才可以貢獻於大東亞戰爭，唯有集中力量，才可以復興中國。</p>
<p>第四，增加生產，是我們一致的要求，增加生產一方面是供給軍需於前綫將士共，一方面是供給必需品於後方民衆。我們也知道在戰爭時期，原料會缺乏的，動力也會减少的，可是我們決不因為原料缺乏而停止生產。反之，應該囚原料缺乏而尋求原料，我們也決不因為動力减少而减少生產。反之，更應該因動力减少，而努力於增加動力的方法。</p>
<p>要之，大東亞戰爭，是我們志在必勝的，大東亞民族的解放，是我們志在必當完成的，我們有這樣的決心，同時更具有無上的毅力，我們必須準備長期戰爭，我們必須準備長期奮鬥、今天我們在這個紀念會上，預祝大東亞戰爭的勝利，大束亞解放的成功。</p>
<p>德總領事致詞</p>
<p>德總領事在節短之演詞中，力言舉行紀念會之重要意義，　稱日德今日團結之密切，猶如兩年之巿，準備以不可動搖之決心，抵抗共同敵人之攻擊，兩國充滿同一之理想，駢肩向勝利之途邁進，德日保為生存之權利而作戰，故必獲勝利云。</p>
<p>滿總領事致詞</p>
<p>本日欣逢大東亞戰爭第二周年紀念日，當此紀念盛典，鄙人得以參加致辭，實屬光榮之至。日軍自開始大戰以來，巳屆二周年，於此期間。遠自眞珠灣之襲擊，馬來島之　定，新嘉坡之攻略，以迄近來波根維爾島，吉爾員特島等處之攻擊，展開熾烈戰鬥，使敵人英美屢戰屢敗，飽受懲創，顯揚八紘一字之精神於中外，此實由於日軍以卓絕精神，經長時間沉默艱苦之訓練，克服種種客觀的不利，始獲有此貴重之賜與，因之賜與大東亞戰爭，方成必勝之體勢。同時我東亞共榮圈建設之基礎，方如磐石之安，如斯驚異的日本之某業，必獲成功之果，巳為人所共知之事，我東亞軸心國之滿華兩國，固無論矣，即新興緬甸·菲列賓·自由印度等構成大東亞共榮圈之各國國民，相信必能共同保持緊密之提携，以貢獻於束亞全局之安定。且抱必勝之信念與堅如鐵石之團結，勵行後方任務，而向生產增强之達邁進。</p>
<p>近藤武官長詞</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭今日進入第三年，本人能與中日兩國，以及大東亞諸國旣德國代表等，參加今日盛典，誠感無上光榮。大東亞戰爭之爆發，乃因英美假和平之美名，逞其侵略東亞之野心，並對於日本在經濟上，軍事上，橫加壓迫此與日木肇國大理想，萬邦各得其所，根水背道而馳，日本為滅侵暴，維正義，遂領導東亞十億民衆毅然而起。</p>
<p>與英美一啓戰端，日軍勇戰善鬥，開戰後不及半載，即將百年來英美侵略東亞勢力驅逐掃蕩。其後一年又四個月中，對敵人所高呼之總反攻，至處加以擊滅　碎敵人戰鬥力與作戰同時並進，大東亞之建設亦逐步進展，日滿間之　帶，日趨堅固，中日日泰之同盟，為完遂共同作戰，更予以刷新，結成緊密關係。又歷年來屈辱於英美虐政，詐欺榨取下之菲律賓及緬甸兩國，亦巳走上新的光明大道，印度國民亦決意揭竿而起，實行解放作戰。今日大東亞寸億民族巳共同立下決心，舉全力擊滅宿敵英美，以求大東亞成為永達的樂園，囘憶十一月五日，大東亞六國代表，共同發表大東亞共同宣言，此宣言以此種決意，闡明於中外，並對毫無任何戰爭目的，徒為野心所驅使之英美，予以重大痛擊。顧目前戰局，太平洋中部及南方之敵人，屢次反攻，作戰結果，徒然使貴重之艦艇與珍貴之生命，沉於海底。在印度洋及中國大陸方而，亦由於日陸海軍密切述絡作戰，使敵人無蠢動餘地。</p>
<p>最近波根維爾島及吉爾貝特羣島方面，敵人損害，實堪驚人。但彼敵人，為何不顧一切犧牲，繼繼反攻，此固恐懼日本之戰鬥力，日見强盛也。蓋敵人深知日本有充裕之時間，將使彼等陷入無可挽回之窘境。因此今後敵人之反攻，無論在南太平洋或印度洋方面，更將愈趨激烈，此可以預料者。但吾人深信於開戰後半載內，所獲致之戰果，及東亞民族全體力量，結集之威力，定能獲得最後勝利，完成大東亞建設，當茲聖戰進入第三年，祈念東亞民族同心戮力，勇戰奮鬥。</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>因總結賬期有感</h3>
<p>銀錢業各行莊本年度總結賬期轉瞬將屆，以是各業放欵如往來透支及信用貸款等，均限總結賬期前一律淸償，而在總結賬期內新放款則循例暫行停止，同時，銀行聯合準備會及錢業聯合準備　對於行莊之拆放，雖可竭力予以通融，惟須限於各行莊正當用途。因此，我們感覺銀錢業在總結賬期間，可謂切實奉行自點自保體制，並拒絕一切含有投機性之放款了，</p>
<p>由於此一期問的銀錢業自肅自保政策，復使我們想到戰時金融業之經常體制，關係整個的產業與民生問題為如何重要了。過去一兩個月間，投機，居奇，壟斷，操縱之風，所以稍稍平息者，團由於當局對調查典取締工作，展開神連，亦由於對銀錢業制止非正式與不合法的貸放。因此，昨日再論物價時，我們認為從通貨金融方面來限制物價之被擾亂，終不失為釜底抽薪的一個物價政策。總之一句話，我們惑覺金融業的投資方向，最足以左右一國的生產狀態與生活狀態，所以，在戰時言金融統制者，無不注重於銀行貸出之管理，元其是經常性的銀行貸出管理。如是而後可以消滅投機，如是而後可以言生產投資。</p>
<h3>各公會理監事　將審查競爭資格　法定人數不得任意添減</h3>
<p>本巿各業同業公會，十九巳改組就緒，而負責會務之理監事人選，亦已分別選出，關係當局鑒於各公會機構、雖經次第確立，但如無良好之人員推動，則依舊不能完成公會任務，達到商業自治精神，各業公會理監事雖依法公開　出，但難免仍有少數不　資格之人員，混雜其間，故關係當局對各公會，理監事之資格，將予以審查，凡合乎下列各款之一者、絕對不得充當理監事：　業外人，　　奪公權者，　有違反國策之書行及犯刑事者之處分經法院判決者。　有破產之宣吿尙未復權者。　受公會除名者，　無行為能力者。當局除審查理監事之資格外，對於人數亦顧及之，各公會理事及監事務須合於法定人數，不得任意添減。</p>
<h3>浙東開征　六項臨時特稅</h3>
<p>中央社寧波訊財政部脅屬稅務處，前日佈吿浙東各縣，於即日起，開始征收桐油·茶葉·猪　·禽毛·糖類·化妝品等六類臨時特稅，幷公佈各項稅率及完納手續，飭各業營商遵照。</p>
<h3>同業買賣商品　訂限制辦法</h3>
<p>最近數週來，關於當局對於管理物價工作，表面上極為冷靜，但實際始終未曾鬆懈，如執行限價調查囤貨等工作，仍本一貫方策，嚴格執行，各當局鑒於物價高漲，成本之造大固為主因，但輾轉買賣互相獲利，無形中增加買方成本。售出時自當抬高價格，故欲澈底壓平物價，對於各業商人之買賣，亦應予以嚴密管理。記者昨自各業公會方面探悉，當局對於同業買賣，巳訂定下列限制，凡商品由　方賣給行方後，行方必須將此項商品賣給經營此等物品之號方，然後由號方將此項商品陳列門市，任憑正常用戶選購，絕對業止行方與行方或號方與號方之買賣，凡商品一經成效，即須出立成交單，以備當局於必要時寄查，而門市售貨，亦須出具發票，以防流弊。</p>

<h3>大東亞戰爭二週年</h3>
<p>— 鹽田大尉</p>
<p>敵方從這緒戰期中所得的教訓，乃航空勢力差不多成為決定近代海戰勝敗的東西。而對潛水艙的改造，也似獲得很大的戰訓。</p>
<p>這樣，緒戰使英美對其海軍兵力及其構成實施大，一轉變戰前的海軍兵力被擊滅之後，配備新的適於新戰略的艙隊。</p>
<p>其新的配備，即反政，可見之於目前在各方面展閒中之各次海戰。那麽，經過緒戰期以後的目前海戰狀態又怎樣呢？　航空部隊的最大增加，航空部隊的火舉空襲作戰；和　破壞日本生產運輪綫的潛水艦戰術之採用。也就是　從空巾，　從水中積極消極的反攻作戰。美國積多年的硏究，而自　的所謂對日渡洋的輪型陣，也卒用航空母艦代戰艦，如在最近的波根維爾島海空戰並吉爾伯特島海空戰中所見。以二艘至三　的航空母艦為根本，以戰艦及巡洋　為護衛艦，前來反攻。</p>
<p>本年初以前，平均以八〇架編隊來　的敵機，至九月時，太平洋方面平均約以三〇〇架的大編隊來襲，自此以後，常以一五〇架以上的戰鬥轟炸聯合編隊不斷前來空襲。</p>
<p>這大編隊先來轟炸日軍陣地，然後用水陸二用戰車領導，使各種舟　繼之登陸。</p>
<p>至於敵方潛水艦的活動，敵方對潛水艦的改益兵員的訓練加以最大的努力，同時，對潛水艦船員的待遇，亦與以最大可能範圍內的最好待遇。所以潛水艦的活動，比戰爭勃發時更頗積性。他們船員中不乏勇敢的人，故我們對其蠢動，勿忘應吏進一步加以警戒。</p>
<p>要之，近代海戰的恃性上，飛機和潛水艦的任務，與以很大的影響。同時，誰也不能否認，南海無數的島嶼，在近代海戰上，也與以最人的影響。</p>
<p>由如上所述海戰的特性，可知今後的太平洋的海上戰鬥，是大消耗戰。大補充戰，又是大生產戰</p>
<p>其次，我再來剖析美國軍需生產力的限界，說明生產之為戰鬥的重大要素之原因。</p>
<p>現在在吉爾怕特方面，所羅門方面展開的所有戰鬥之最大特徵，乃基地對基地的攻防戰，借羅斯福的話來說：是「跳島」的戰鬥。這些島，距東京二六〇〇至二七〇〇哩，距美國的舊金山四三〇〇哩，距夏威夷一五〇〇至二〇〇〇哩。日美都不能不仰求後方的補充。所以後方必須有極大的補充源和强大的運輸力。　補充力，　運輸力，是決定勝收之鍵。所以戰綫的勝收，決於後方國民的勝敗，戰綫的戰果，就是後方的戰果。</p>
<p>先說補充力，美國的生產力，以本年五六月為最高限度，此後的生產力量即不見上　。這一點，我們戰前研究的毫無不同。即美國至一九四三年達生產的最高　。戰前從南方及其他各地所奪取的軍需存貨，在一九四三年末，大體巳經使用完了。第二，因勞　力及其他作川，自本年末起，可斷定生產補充力不會增加。但事實上在此前的半一年，早巳表現了本年六月起的那現象。無論戰時生產局長官端納，納爾遜怎樣　起，無論諾克斯怎樣吹牛，生產資材的不足，勞　力的不足，在在均為難事。鎢是合金生產上必要的原料，這是華南，緬甸方面的世界的特產物，佔世界理藏及的七〇％，美國的鎢生產，不滿平時需要的三分之一。美國祇靠產於南美的不到世界理藏量一〇％的　。美國模做開戰前的日本所為，努力　造木製飛機，並非無因。鋼·鐵·銅·鋁·所謂美國三重要統制資材，戰　產八八·〇〇〇萬噸，本年减少至三〇〇萬噸。納爾遜長官說：「美國的鋼鐵製產力，已達最高峯，比這再要增加是很困難的。」又　克斯說，「艦艇以至飛機部內的生產，因以鋼鐵為中心的資材之不足，故頗困難。」</p>
<p>又遂行戰爭上所不可缺的橡膠，馬來一帶所產佔世界產額的九〇％。因此，美國因不能獲得橡膠乃禁止民間需用，並從事製造人造橡膠。橡膠統制官威廉，傑弗斯在國內橡膠的統制上取斷然措置，不准增加消費。戰前美國的橡膠保有額七〇〇·〇〇〇噸，去年已使用大半，至本年末，是否還能殘存一噸，頗為疑問，且日本已把天然橡膠製成揮發件極高的航空機燃料，美國現在的焦燥，不難想</p>
<p>至於石油，美國的消費量也比其國內生產量超過四〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇桶。錫·美國毫無生產，南方則產世界的百分之九十。又熱帶戰上所不可少奎靑，　羅門產全世界的九八％。</p>
<p>如上所述生產資材不足的美國，在飛機船舶的生產額上，明年的生產額無論如何不會此本年的生產額為高，可知美國的生產補充力，本年為最高峯。美國海軍委員會資材輸入部長伏爾修說「美國在開戰前所有的一千一百萬四月　一五七艘　一·六〇六·〇〇〇噸五月　一七五艘　一·七八二·〇〇〇六月　一六八艘　一·七六七·五〇〇九月　一六〇艘　一·六五二·六五一</p>
<p>這完全是因為鋼鐵資材的不同所致。又美國海軍委員會說：「一九四四年度的造船目標，與本年噸商船隊，在開戰後一年間，喪失殆盡」。又至本年，自去年起至本年五月未止在增加中的造船額，六月以後，漸　減少。即同，為二千萬噸。這並不是說美國毋須二千萬噸以上的造船目標，不如說美國已到達了最高最大限度的造船能力（轉第四版）</p>

<h3>大東亞戰爭</h3>
<p>（第三版轉入）</p>
<p>現在運輸兵士一名，需要二十噸船　，故運輪五十萬軍隊，必需五百萬　船腹，而對於每個士兵的補充，又需二噸船腹。如此計算起來，派遣五十萬軍隊至前綫，最初必需五百萬噸，經常又需一百萬噸的船腹，如再加上船舶的條理期間，轟沉的損失等，則其三分之一不能使用，這樣考察起來，敵方所能活動的兵力，也有限度，又就人口，即兵力之點而言，美國的總人口一億三千萬，如其除掉了女子·孩子·黑人·勞　人口等，則其所能動員的最大限度也不過三百萬。</p>
<p>這是拿敵方的例，來解說日本的將來的生產力和補充力。要之，美國的戰力、水年達最高峯，反之，日本自明年起可作眞正的戰爭。在這一點上，戰鬥態　雖比敵方　後一年半，但擊滅敵的戰前所有全部戰艦，航空母艦，巡洋艦的日本海軍，尚絲毫未損。敵方目前在太平洋上的艦艇，幾完全是新建的。但日本海軍迄今猶嚴陣以待決戰的體制中。此次在波根維爾　所給與敵方的損審、計戰艦二三艘，空母三〇艘，巡洋艙九八艘。此外，如再加以擊毀的其他各種艙艇，則敵方的出血極多。而共人員的損失，實為致命的打　。紐約泰晤士報十月二十二日揭載軍事評論家漢遜·鮑爾溫的論文說：「美國的造船千九百萬噸」，內中約有三〇〇萬噸是處造的數量，又說「美國有二十一艘二力艦，十二艘至十五艘的航空母艦，數卞　補助及護衛用航空母艦及飛機運輸艦，」縱使說這是眞的但以美國生產力的現狀和日本海軍航空之最近的顯著增加比較起來，亦不值得驚異。</p>
<h3>強固的日本海軍</h3>
<p>自元帥山本大將在南海飛機上與敵交戰陣亡後約七個月，　接精悍無比的故元帥之後任古賀長官的日本海軍將士。在此開戰記念日，我們以完全的信賴和尊敬，據戲於長官並海軍將士。二年以來。常以真兵對十數倍之敵而獲大戰果。但　不動搖。不　功而驅，惟默然向戰鬥邁進。我們對海軍將士，不能不及早整備戰鬥配置的決戰態勞。</p>
<p>經七十年來月月火水木金金的猛訓練，希有今日的到來。磨勵以須。日本海軍經三年戰爭之後，對今後的勇戰奮鬥，有極大期待。日本海軍在訓練中所培餋的必勝信念，和武器的故良，戰略的硏究，又常在敵人前面，夏威夷　　以來，至今後亦將繼續進行的空軍之戰鬥，實為世界王座的日本海軍所採用的制度，即甲種，乙種，丙種預預訓練制度所致，這在今日的戰果上，扮演極重要的任務，加以目前全國正在培養中的此等少年飛打兵，則日本海軍在開戰第三年的偉容，實穩固不可動搖。看到絡續繼前輩遺志的靑少年之期氣蓬勃的情形，無論敵方怎樣前來反攻，亦徒然多流大量出血而巳。（完）（翼譯）</p>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪羊譯</p>
<p>一星期過去了。第七天晚上，產婦若子，體力巳恢復得和通常一般，又從產褥上操勞家事了。今年四十四歲，生了十一個孩子的女人，揣想起來，身體一定很强壯的，事實却不然，瘦小得可憐。面色白爭，肌膚細緻，有着一頭鄉村女子常所有的豐滿的黑髮。要說她是美人吧！高頰骨·原嘴脣，呆板而無禮　的表情。不過，她那眼角下垂，聲音柔和，却又嫵媚可愛。她本是雜貨店的妻子。白米之外，還做着烟草，雜貨，燒酒之類的買賣，所以她的舉動，也是低聲下氣的。什麼地方也看不出一點强處來。並且她，也是一個平民的女兒，不知道什麼呌作「道理」，談不到所謂「權利」，一個平凡的，傳統的，薩摩地方的女人。除却勞　，信仰，養兄育女等事情以外，不配追求什麼人生意義的女人。</p>
<p>「春子……快要嚮午了。」</p>
<p>她又要從產褥上使喚長女了。</p>
<p>「噢！」</p>
<p>像父親一樣實默的春子，在產屋前的廚房裏，用醬油在煮糖芋春子年紀才十七歲，在母親做產的期問，就接過了一切炊事。十五歲的長男眞藏，荏弱無力，不能有什麽幫助。十四歲的滿子，十三歲的眞一郞、倒能夠掃除家屋咧，送達店內物品咧，還有點兒用處。最麻煩的要算兩歲的太朗。多孩子的家庭，家事意外地聲頓得井井有條。生產時，無論那一次，都沒有麗人，而且順利地過去了。</p>
<p>「春子……加治木家那裏，燒潛送去了嗎。」</p>
<p>「送去了一升……」</p>
<p>母親如是的吩咐了一遍，就安心地望着黑中透亮的天棚板，雖說是街上的住家，一半是近農家的建築。灶間頗大，述產屋在內，一共三間——樓上雖有堆置雜物的小間，不過可以供供孩子們讀書用。到了晚上，每一個房問，都要被這十三個人的家族們充塞滿了的。但現在，靜寂無聲，祇從與次那海濱那裏，可以聽到梟鳥的叫聲而已。</p>
<p>隔壁睡着的眞人，忽然高聲啼哭起來。生產慣了的母親，一聽就知這孩子在訴餓了。</p>
<p>那女人敞開了胸膛，把乳頭塞在小孩嘴裹，飽滿的乳房，似乎跟她的年齡不稱。不過，更可驚的，是扶着那乳房的指掌。好像破舊的棒球手套般粗大的手指和手掌。那是從二十四歲出嫁以後，到今天為止，二十年來不斷地操勞着一切家事的女人的手。</p>

<h3>Our Attitude</h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, and also the first anniversary of the resumption of publication of this newspaper. In this past year, we are ashamed to say that we have made no contribution to the nation, society, or even Greater East Asia. However, compared to the attitude we have held from the beginning with the facts of the past year, after honest reflection, there is not much discrepancy. As for what our attitude is, it can be summarized into the following points:</p>
<p>Newspaper business is a permanent undertaking. Therefore, it should be managed with a detached sense of enterprise to establish a lasting foundation. It should constantly and correctly promote national welfare and people's livelihood, and absolutely not be used as a tool for temporary political propaganda. This is the fundamental viewpoint of this newspaper since its resumption of publication.</p>
<p>Our attitude towards the current situation is to support the Nanjing National Government's peace policies and national policies. At the same time, we will cooperate with allied nations to complete the victory of the Greater East Asia War, taking the Greater East Asia Declaration passed by the recent Greater East Asia Conference as the highest political ideal.</p>
<p>Our attitude in writing is to fully rely on public opinion. The people are the foundation of the nation, and the nation is originally a collective of the people. It is not difficult to inspire the people's love for their country, and it can even be said to be innate. Whether it is developed and to what extent depends entirely on how much the rulers value public opinion. To put it bluntly, if the rulers value public opinion and cherish the people, then how can the people not cherish the government and the country? Based on this principle, we absolutely value public opinion. All our arguments are based on and express public opinion. Therefore, even if we advocate reforming politics to the government, and are somewhat straightforward, we do not care. We believe this attitude is the most sincere expression to the government. Because in today's era, hypocritical praise and flattery are neither what we want to say nor what we expect the wise authorities to want to hear. Secondly, our attitude towards allied nations in our writing is completely the same. Furthermore, we have always maintained that if the allied nations need to talk about genuine Sino-Japanese friendship, they must first understand Chinese public opinion. If they do not understand Chinese public opinion, then the foundation of all policies is no different from building on sand. We often adopt critical arguments to prompt the authorities of allied nations to pay attention to the fact that the traces of the past between China and Japan should be improved through a thorough understanding of public opinion.</p>
<p>Our attitude towards the Chongqing regime and the Chinese Communist Party is to oppose relying on Britain and the United States to undermine China's unity, and to oppose dragging the war and plunging the people into misery. However, we especially oppose the "amphibious animals" of double-dealing. What are "amphibious animals"? They are those who hang up a signboard, on one side Chongqing, but on the other side Nanjing or Japan, relying on tricks to deceive and confuse the public for their own gain.</p>
<p>In the past year, due to limitations in manpower and resources, there are many things that were planned but could not be done. Compared with advanced countries, China's news industry is indeed far behind. However, this newspaper has been published for seventy years and has a long-standing position in history. Binhe happens to be in charge of this newspaper at this time. I dare not usurp the past history and achievements of my predecessors. But I will never shirk my current responsibilities. I only hope that China's news industry can catch up and keep pace with advanced countries. That would be fortunate!</p>
<h3>Prime Minister's Broadcast Last Night to Commemorate the Third Year of Victory, and Attended the Prayer Festival at Yasukuni Shrine</h3>
<p>Nationwide Silent Prayer for Certain Victory Held</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - Two years have passed since Japan declared war on Britain and the United States. December 8th, a day that all East Asian nations will never forget, has come again. On this day, all Japanese citizens will offer a one-minute silent prayer for certain victory at 11:59 a.m. at their respective locations, echoing the determination to strike and destroy Britain and the United States. In Tokyo, citizens praying for certain victory in front of the Imperial Palace since morning have been continuous. The Yokusanzonendan mobilized 140,000 members nationwide at dawn to solemnly hold prayers for certain victory in various places. At 9:00 a.m., a ceremony to read the Imperial Rescript was held in the auditorium of Tokyo Imperial University. All universities and vocational schools across Japan also held similar ceremonies to pray for Japan's certain victory and to wish the students sent to the front a long and successful military career. Prime Minister Tojo, along with cabinet members, representatives of the army and navy, and various veterans' groups, attended the "Imperial Army's Prayer Festival for Lasting Military Fortune" held at Yasukuni Shrine at 10:00 a.m. to pray for certain victory to the spirits of the patriotic martyrs. Prime Minister Tojo also delivered a major broadcast speech at 7:20 p.m. on the 8th to the 100 million people of Japan and the 1 billion people of East Asia, commemorating the third year of victory.</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Tojo's Broadcast Address</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - On the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, Prime Minister Tojo of Japan delivered a special broadcast to the nation from the Central Broadcasting Station at 7:20 p.m. on the 8th, urging the people to unite and work together to strive for final victory. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Two years have passed since our country declared war on Britain and the United States on December 8th of the year before last. Looking back over the past two years, our army, under the Emperor's grace, has planned well and fought bravely. Recently, taking advantage of the enemy's large-scale counter-offensive, we have successively achieved rare and great victories. We are currently striving for final victory. I would like to express my deep gratitude to all the soldiers fighting day and night on the entire front line, express my condolences to the heroic spirits who died in battle, and express my deep respect to the people who have worked hard and strived for final victory.</p>
<p>Allied Nations Closely United, the Future is Full of Light</p>
<p>Two years ago today, in order to break the economic and military oppression of Britain and the United States, and to achieve our country's own independence and self-defense, we had no choice but to resolutely take up arms. Therefore, our righteous army was invincible, and the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States were swept away and driven out of East Asia. The nations of Greater East Asia rose up, and the nations of Greater East Asia, based on brotherly relations, intensified their cooperation to transform abundant resources into war power, and worked together to build Greater East Asia based on morality, striving to achieve common goals. The firm common determination of the one billion people of Greater East Asia has been further consolidated by the recent Greater East Asia Conference. Comparing this with the situation before the war, it is clear that the situation in Greater East Asia has completely changed, and our future is now wide open and full of light. On the other hand, the fighting spirit of the European allied nations is also becoming more and more vigorous, overcoming all difficulties and continuing to strive. Our country's cooperation with the European allied nations is also becoming closer day by day. The East and the West echo each other to crush the ambitions of Britain and the United States, and continue to bravely advance towards the common goal of building a new world order.</p>
<p>Points out that the Cairo Conference Exposes the Ambitions of Domination</p>
<p>Looking at the enemy's side, the British and American leaders often shout about justice, humanity, fraternity, benevolence, and righteousness, but what they do is completely contrary to this. For example, their barbaric act of repeatedly bombing our hospital ships is not allowed by gods and men. In order to seek their own prosperity, they do not hesitate to sacrifice other countries and other nations. They shout about opening the door and equal opportunities to our East Asia, while implementing exclusionary policies and unequal treatment against the nations of East Asia in their own countries. In short, what they seek from the nations of East Asia is to be their permanent slaves. Recently, the British and American leaders held talks in Cairo, arbitrarily discussing the disposal of East Asia, and attempting to make Japan a third-rate country. This is enough to prove that they are tired of fighting and feel deeply uneasy about the future, so they are trying to cover up their current failures. They did not mention the regions of the world that have not been plundered by them for many years, or the nations under their oppression, because what they seek is neither justice nor humanity, but still to extract from other nations to seek their selfish prosperity. Today, they are playing tricks on Chongqing, making them continue to engage in useless resistance. Their intention is obviously to permanently alienate the nations of Greater East Asia, making East Asia their colony forever, and completing their ambition to dominate East Asia. The so-called Cairo Conference is nothing more than exposing their ambitions to the world and explaining what their war aims are.</p>
<p>Increasingly Strengthen Unity to Cope with Long-Term War</p>
<p>Their ideals are completely incompatible with the noble spirit shared by the nations of Greater East Asia. The noble spirit shared by the nations of Greater East Asia is to maintain friendly relations with all countries in the world, eliminate racial discrimination, communicate cultures, and further open up resources, so as to contribute to world culture. The people of Britain and the United States are being deceived by tyrannical and unscrupulous leaders, and the suffering of the war is becoming increasingly profound. It is inevitable that they will doubt the purpose of this war. The British and American leaders are currently taking active actions to try to achieve their greedy and insatiable ambitions. In their anxiety, they are repeatedly launching stubborn counter-offensives, which is expected. Therefore, the war situation will become more intense and prolonged. We have long held the determination that the means adopted to strike at the tyrannical Britain and the United States have been revealed. Since the enemy is trying to achieve their ambitions by violence, we can only destroy them by strength. Because forbearance and self-respect have reached their limit, we have no choice but to take up arms for self-preservation and self-defense. The determination made on this day two years ago is like yesterday. Now, with the belief of certain victory, we will increasingly strengthen the unity of Greater East Asia, and hold the determination to completely destroy Britain and the United States. No matter how fierce the enemy's counter-offensive is, we will not care. We will only resolutely repay them with killing, and further give them a thorough beating until they surrender.</p>
<p>One Hundred Million People United as One to Strive for Final Victory</p>
<p>The way to victory is definitely not something that can be obtained easily. It requires one hundred million people at home and abroad to do their best in their respective positions and daily lives to fulfill their utmost sincerity in serving the country in order to achieve it. The key to victory is in our own hands, and the fervent loyalty, fervent souls, and strong will to destroy the enemy are the foundation of final victory. If our one hundred million compatriots can unite as one, do their best, and fight to the death, then final victory will surely be ours. You, the soldiers on the front line, are fighting fiercely and achieving brilliant victories near Bougainville and the Gilbert Islands, and in central China. This is commendable and grateful. All our soldiers deeply understand the great righteousness, do not expect to return alive, and are willing to leave their homes and go to the front line. Seeing the patriotic enthusiasm of all sectors of the people, we are even more convinced that victory will belong to us. Although our compatriots at home are still in the rear, their hearts are on the battlefield, vowing to strengthen their combat power during wartime. With the belief of a long-term war, and striving to make the third year the decisive year, we will surely be able to accomplish the country's future. Moreover, the hearts of one hundred million Japanese people are also the hearts of one billion people in Greater East Asia. Therefore, if the Greater East Asia War cannot be completed, Greater East Asia cannot be built. Whether the one billion people of Greater East Asia can live and work in peace and prosperity, or fall under the oppression of Britain and the United States again, depends on this great war. Our one hundred million compatriots and the one billion people of Greater East Asia will join hands to complete the war and complete the construction. This is inevitable. On the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, I would like to renew the determination made two years ago with all the people, uphold the belief of certain victory, and vow to strive for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>

<h3>Military Progress in China War During the Second Anniversary of the Great East Asian War Japanese Dispatch Army Authorities Announced Talks Yesterday</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Dispatch Army authorities stationed in China issued a statement on the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, as follows:</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War and the China War, the Allies suffered a disastrous defeat. Knowing the disadvantage of the long-term war of attrition, they obtained a fully prepared wartime situation and strived for a counterattack. Currently, fierce decisive battles are being developed in the southern sea area. In addition to the counterattack in the southern sea area, the Allies attach importance to the counterattack in Burma, which is a link in the counterattack against Japan, and the counterattack from the mainland of China, driving the Chongqing side to fight a thorough war of resistance, and attempting to directly bomb the Japanese mainland by the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing and cut off maritime transportation. However, after Chongqing gave up hope of self-reliance in the war of resistance, it tried its best to place its hopes on relying on Britain and the United States, dreaming of the victory of the anti-Axis countries, allowing Britain and the United States to grasp the supreme command and the arrogance of the air force. Even the economic re-invasion continues its recklessness. Therefore, the current stage of the war on the Chinese mainland is gradually showing a complex and profound phenomenon. The status of the Chinese front in the Greater East Asia War is also becoming more important. In the second year of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Dispatch Army stationed in China not only engaged in its original mission of destroying the Chongqing army and launching active mopping-up operations against the communist army, but also took preemptive measures against the movements of the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force to block their so-called air raids on the Japanese mainland.</p>
<p>The War Results of the Japanese Dispatch Army in China for One Year. The most important operations of the Japanese Dispatch Army stationed in China in the past year include the Taihang Mountain operations in the spring and summer of North China, the anti-communist operations in the autumn, the Dabie Mountain operations in Central China, the offensive operations in the spring and summer, the operations in the southwest area of Taihu Lake, the operations in the Guangzhou Bay and Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway line areas in South China, and the currently launched offensive operations in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Other active activities have also been continuously carried out in Mongolia, Central China, South China, and North China. Now, let's list the general war results as follows: (A) The number of battles is approximately 22,000, with an average of 1,900 per month and approximately 67 per day, which is slightly less than the 25,000 in the previous year. Moreover, the number of military launches is about the same as last year. From this point of view, it is sufficient to prove that the Chongqing army is trying its best to avoid combat. (B) The total number of combat troops is approximately 3,300,000, which is slightly less than the 3,600,000 in the previous year. The reason for this is, of course, none other than the Chongqing army's efforts to avoid combat mentioned in the previous item. However, on the other hand, it can also prove the difficulty of replenishing the Chongqing army's troops. (C) Approximately 210,000 Chongqing troops were killed in battle, and approximately 200,000 were captured and surrendered. The ratio of the latter to the former is 95%. However, this ratio was 12% in the 29th year of the Republic of China, 29% in the 30th year of the Republic of China, and 44% in the 31st year of the Republic of China. From this point of view, in the most recent year, the number of people captured and surrendered has greatly increased. However, in the past, most of them were local and scattered surrenders, but now they have become group and regional surrenders. This is because the military and civilians under the rule of Chongqing have realized that the war of resistance is not a plan, and it is sufficient to prove the decline in the Chongqing army's combat power. (D) The number of artillery and heavy firearms intercepted by the Japanese army has decreased compared to the past, but the number of bayonets and other weapons has increased, which is sufficient to prove that after the Greater East Asia War, the Chongqing army's supply route was cut off, and the replenishment of its main weapons was insufficient, so its equipment gradually declined.</p>
<p>Situation. (A) Chongqing side. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, due to the deterioration of the internal and external situation, the Chongqing side's weaknesses, such as the economic crisis and the decline of popular sentiment, were successively exposed. However, the Chongqing side still imagined that Britain and the United States would win the victory, so that they could win the victory when the world war ended. Therefore, on the outside, they only knew how to flatter Britain and the United States. On the inside, they avoided military consumption, focused on internal construction, and devoted themselves to solving the economic difficulties of the war of resistance. At the same time, for their internal construction, they focused on developing the border areas. From this, it can be seen that the Chongqing side's so-called war of resistance and national construction and post-war management, although containing many weaknesses, still act arbitrarily. At the same time, they do not express any cooperation with the British and American counter-offensive operations in East Asia. However, in view of the blows suffered on the Burma front in the past, they still have a sense of unease in this operation to recapture Burma. (B) Chongqing-Communist relations. When the Soviet Union announced the dissolution of the Third International, the Chongqing side took the opportunity to increase pressure on the Chinese Communist Party, resulting in conflicts between Chongqing and the Communist Party in various places. The degree of opposition between the two sides is unprecedented. The Chongqing side demanded that the Chinese Communist Party reflect on itself, claiming that it hoped to solve the political problem and attempted to stop the Communist Party's edge. At the same time, it adopted all measures to suppress or even destroy the expansion of the Communist Party's power in both material and spiritual aspects. After the dissolution of the Third International, the Chinese Communist Party tried its best to prevent internal turmoil. At the same time, it always demonstrated its armed resistance to the Chongqing side. In fact, the efforts made by both sides to solve the current Chongqing-Communist problem are all aimed at benefiting themselves. In this way, the Chongqing-Communist sides have gone through several divisions and mergers in the modern Chinese revolution, and are still continuing their ugly and nameless struggle. (C) U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing. The U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing is sufficient to reflect the United States' active intention to counterattack Japan. This is the independent 14th Air Force of the Army, commanded by Brigadier General Chennault, under the command of the U.S. Air Force stationed in India in October of this year. Since then, it has been actively strengthened in terms of both manpower and resources. There have been sorties in the past, but our air force often implements appropriate advance operations, so until now, it has not been able to fulfill its plan to bomb the Japanese mainland. Until recently, a part of the Chongqing Air Force was incorporated under its command to establish a U.S.-Chongqing mixed air force unit, gradually showing the power of the U.S. Air Force to dominate the Chongqing Air Force. At the same time, it also wants to greatly strengthen the U.S. Air Force itself in the near future in order to bomb our battlefields and block maritime transportation lines. This should be closely monitored and guarded. Conclusion. In this second year of the Greater East Asia War, the Chinese front has gradually changed its state, increasingly increasing the importance of a link in the Greater East Asia War. As mentioned above, in the third year of the war, the Chongqing side did not understand our country's true intentions, but overestimated our strength and continued its war of resistance policy. Although the Chongqing side will try its best to avoid military consumption and adopt guerrilla tactics to disrupt the security work in the rear, the United States, in order to achieve its ambition to control East Asia, is actively planning to launch a counteroffensive from the Chinese front. At the same time, it is also not difficult to understand that it is seizing the opportunity to bomb the Japanese mainland more urgently. From the above points, the situation on the Chinese front in the third year of the Greater East Asia War cannot be underestimated. Our country's strategic posture toward the Chongqing side, from Mongolia, through North China, Central China, South China, Vietnam, Thailand, to Burma, forms a winding 4,000-kilometer encirclement line. The strategically important strongholds are all in our army's hands, so it is not difficult to give them a painful blow at any time and anywhere. The so-called leading troops deep into the enemy's territory and controlling their fate is by no means difficult under our army's strategy. As for the U.S. Air Force, its main bases are now all within our army's sphere of influence. In order to destroy its bases and eliminate its power, our army has completed all preparations, which is the clearest. The dispatch group adheres to the established policy, increasingly promoting its morale, strengthening its combat power and war preparations, and exerting its full strength to destroy all resistance forces that stand in the way of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Youth Hold Dawn General Mobilization</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) – Two years have passed since Japan officially declared war on Britain and the United States. Throughout East Asia, everyone is celebrating this second anniversary. In the capital, youth league members gathered at 8:00 AM in front of the Sun Yat-sen statue at Xinjiekou to hold a Dawn Mobilization Assembly. After the ceremony, they held a city-wide parade and planted trees at Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. Youth league members from various schools went to the National Assembly Hall to participate in a Pro-Asia Lecture after the Dawn Mobilization Assembly. In the afternoon, the Propaganda Department, in conjunction with China Film Company, screened a movie at the National Assembly Hall. Japanese residents, starting from the morning of the 8th, wore battle uniforms, abstained from smoking and drinking, and paraded in the city as a volunteer army, shouting "Down with Britain and America" and "Victory in the Greater East Asia War." The entire city, Chinese and Japanese civilians alike, were filled with intense and fierce combat spirit.</p>
<h3>National Government's Declaration of War Proclamation</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th two years ago, the National Government, in accordance with the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, declared its determination to share weal and woe with friendly nation Japan. Since then, it has embarked on the New National Movement, engaged in safeguarding public order, and attended to people's livelihood, with the aim of enhancing national strength and assisting in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, Britain, the United States, and other countries continue to use their century-old policy of dividing and controlling East Asia, and have even intensified their efforts, even colluding with the Chongqing faction to participate in the so-called Anglo-American battle line, sending troops to Burma and India, using East Asians to kill East Asians. Recently, because their forces have been successively defeated by the armies, navies, and air forces of friendly nation Japan, and their bases for invading East Asia have also been lost, they have become even more cunning. Moreover, they are jealous of the peaceful development of the National Government's controlled areas, constantly instigating the Chongqing faction to harass us, in order to obstruct the progress of various construction projects, and even directly using their own aircraft, using the Chongqing faction as a base, to repeatedly bomb our Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, harming civilians. The Chongqing faction, willingly subjected to British and American manipulation and acting as traitors to East Asia, is indeed shameful. Moreover, Britain and the United States, harboring ulterior motives toward East Asia, have exhausted their ability to sow discord in order to achieve their ultimate ambition of annexation. This is something that East Asian nations should regard as a common enemy. The National Government hereby declares that from today onwards, it is at war with Britain and the United States, and will exert all its strength to cooperate with friendly nation Japan, sweeping away the brutality of Britain and America in order to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. The two countries, Manchukuo and Thailand, have always maintained friendly relations and share the same heart for the common prosperity of East Asia. In the future, they should further cooperate in order to jointly build a new East Asian order based on righteousness. The friendly nations of Germany and Italy have been engaged in a struggle with British and American forces in the West for many years, repeatedly winning glorious victories. Our country is now participating in the Greater East Asia War and should echo them in order to contribute to a just new order for the entire world. All of our citizens should know that this is the only opportunity to realize the Three Principles of the People’s concept of Greater Asianism. The revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the attainment of righteous peace for the entire world all depend on this. Let us be of one mind and one heart, exerting our strength from beginning to end, in order to fulfill this great mission of this great era!</p>
<p>January 9th, Year 32 of the Republic of China Chairman: Wang Zhaoming</p>
<h3>Former Lieutenant General Tanaka's Remarks</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Naval Attaché to China, Lieutenant General Minoru Tanaka, issued a statement on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, the gist of which is as follows: Two years ago today, the Imperial Rescript was promulgated, followed immediately by the announcement of major victories such as the Battle of Hawaii, the air raid on the Philippines, and the landing in Malaya. The morale of the Japanese people can be said to be unprecedented. Now, at a time when major victories have been repeatedly won in the South Pacific, on this second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, I am deeply gratified. The ambitions of the enemy countries to invade East Asia for centuries were extinguished one after another by the Japanese army in less than half a year after the start of the war. Now, everywhere is a place for the coexistence of all nations, and the construction of co-prosperity among all countries is being carried out in order to cooperate in completing the war. Since the Greater East Asia Conference, the unity of East Asian nations has been further strengthened. However, at this time, the enemy's counter-offensive momentum cannot be underestimated. Fierce naval battles are currently unfolding. Judging from the war situation in Bougainville and the Gilbert Islands, it can be seen that the enemy is trying to counterattack, disregarding great sacrifices and fighting desperately. Therefore, the war situation is very serious. We must, no matter what, defeat Britain and America and thoroughly punish their delusions. Both sides have achieved great results in this war. In today's total war, there is no distinction between the front and the rear, no distinction between inside and outside. Everyone is on the front line and should each stay in their own position. With the strength of one billion people in East Asia, united as one, the path to East Asia has already been clearly indicated in the previous Greater East Asia Declaration. However, the road ahead is still long and difficult. In the future, there is no room for optimism. Today, we can only strive forward towards this light in an effort to restore East Asia to its original state. Although the East Asian issue is extremely complex and divergent, its core is actually China and Japan. If these two countries are not closely united, they cannot be the central axis of East Asian unity. Therefore, in order to complete the war and build up the stock after the war, the Sino-Japanese national relations should be based on the treaty of alliance to establish a permanent foundation of friendship. This matter, although it must wait for the sincere awakening of the peoples of the two countries and their mutual active understanding, is extremely important for the efforts of Japanese residents in China in their respective positions. The most important thing for us in the local area is to contribute to the completion of the war in our own position, paying attention to the long past and the reality, and realizing that this is not easy. However, we must face the future, strive to rise up. The relationship between countries is a matter between people. Whether things succeed or not depends on how sincere people are. The permanent and unchanging affection of the nation and the people is based on mutual trust and reliance. We must treat people and handle affairs with a sincere and humble attitude before God, and then we will surely have a sense of mutual trust and respect. Moreover, if the local area is strong, then people should also use the spirit of brave battle like the soldiers on the front line, with one heart and one mind, and give their sincerity to the 400 million people of China. I deeply hope that on this day next year, I will be able to see this kind of transformation.</p>

<h3>Chongqing's 10th Army Completely Annihilated</h3>
<p>Hankou, 8th (Central News Agency) – Zhou Yingxiang, commander of the 3rd Division of Chongqing's 10th Army, previously led his division north from the 9th War Zone to rescue Changde. When he reached Leijiazhou, 24 kilometers south of Changde, he was surrounded and fiercely attacked by the Japanese army and suffered heavy losses. As a result, Division Commander Zhou Yingxiang only led a remnant regiment to Zhangshan City, 5 kilometers south of Changde. However, in that area, they were again surrounded by the Japanese army. By the morning of the 4th, there were few left in that unit. Thereupon Division Commander Zhou Yingxiang led several of his subordinates to escape the Japanese encirclement. They attempted to escape northwest along the Yuan River, but the Japanese army continued to pursue them fiercely. By 6:00 PM that afternoon, the division commander was shot in the head and died in battle. Zhang Huimin, commander of the 9th Regiment of the division, also died in battle on the 3rd. According to reports, Sun Zhaojin, commander of the 10th Division, and Zhu Yue, commander of the 190th Division, of the 10th Army, which went north to rescue Changde, have all died in battle one after another. Now, Zhou Yingxiang, commander of the 3rd Division, has also died in battle. The army is almost completely annihilated.</p>

Japanese fighter planes engaged them in fierce air battles, shooting down ten P-40 aircraft and destroying several B-25 aircraft. The remaining aircraft fled, and all Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.</p>
<h3>President Jiang of the Examination Yuan Talks About Future Plans</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) – Two years have passed in a flash since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Yesterday, the reporter paid a special visit to Jiang Kanghu, President of the Examination Yuan of the National Government, to inquire about future plans for promoting the national examination administration. He said the following: The Examination Yuan is in charge of four types of examinations: Higher Examinations, Ordinary Examinations, Special Examinations, and Certification Examinations. In the three years since the return to the capital, only two Higher Examinations have been held in the capital and North China. The Examination Yuan will propose that the other three types of examinations should be held successively in the near future, so that examinations will be the only legitimate way for the state to select and employ talents, and the Examination Yuan will be the only government agency to implement the examination administration. The planned plan is like this, and thereafter, we will gradually promote it according to the needs of the facts and the permission of the environment.</p>
<h3>Turkish President Meets with Roosevelt and Churchill in Cairo No Military Representatives Participate</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency) – Reuters reports that a British correspondent in Cairo reports that Roosevelt and Churchill in Cairo have held a meeting with Turkish President İsmet İnönü to exchange views on the Tehran Conference. British Foreign Secretary Eden, US representative Hopkins, and Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu also participated in the discussions.</p>
<p>Ankara, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters, Turkish President İsmet İnönü had not yet returned to the Turkish capital yesterday afternoon but was already on the way from Adana to the Turkish capital. According to people close to the Turkish Prime Minister, General Taksamak did not accompany İsmet to Cairo. Apart from the President's adjutant, no military representatives participated in the Cairo Conference. The speculation that military issues were not discussed at the Cairo Conference is probably correct. According to British sources, the Cairo Conference was not a continuation of the Adana Conference, which focused on military matters. Turkish political sources believe that İsmet has received reports on the resolutions and results of the Tehran Conference. İsmet's visit was probably suggested by Roosevelt, and the Cairo Conference has become more important due to the Tehran Conference communique calling on all countries to participate in the war against Germany. İsmet may report to a special cabinet meeting today on his visit to Cairo.</p>
<p>Berlin Keeps Silent</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters, the German Foreign Ministry yesterday still refrained from clarifying its attitude towards the rumored meeting between Turkish President İsmet İnönü and Roosevelt and Churchill. A spokesman pointed out that although Turkish newspapers have published their views, the Turkish official authorities have not issued a statement. Turkish newspapers have emphasized that Turkey's neutrality policy was decided by the agreement of the Turkish President, government, and National Assembly, and there is no reason to change it.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters, Turkish Prime Minister Saraçoğlu met with German Ambassador to Turkey, Papen, at noon on the 6th for a meeting.</p>
<p>German Newspapers Comment on the Iranian Conference</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters, local newspapers commented on the Tehran Conference communique, believing that the conference was a political failure and that all discussions were controlled by Stalin. Roosevelt and Churchill had to follow Stalin's wishes. The "Berlin Evening News" stated that the communique was very short and contained nothing surprising. We had expected that the participants would appeal to small countries and that they would continue to put pressure on them because Roosevelt could not return home empty-handed. The Tehran Conference and recent history's encouragement regarding the future of small countries are the most inappropriate measures to gain the trust of small countries and can be viewed as a political failure.</p>
<p>Voroshilov Reportedly to Visit Britain to Discuss Military Plans</p>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters, Washington sources: The news that Soviet General Voroshilov is about to visit London has made Americans more confident that the date of the invasion of Western Europe is near. It is expected that General Voroshilov's mission is to jointly agree on an offensive plan with the British and American chiefs of staff.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters, London sources: General Smuts met with Roosevelt and Churchill in Cairo.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle for Monte Cassino The Focus of the Italian War Shifts to the West</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters, the anti-Axis forces broke the quiet atmosphere on the southern Italian front on Monday. The British Eighth Army and the US Fifth Army participated in the offensive at the same time. The focus of the war is still on the flanks. The US military, on the western flank, launched an attack on various points of the front line with a large number of troops after artillery preparation. Its main target was Monte Cassino. After a day of fierce fighting, the enemy was able to gain some foothold in the mountainous area. Monte Cassino is located on the east bank of the Garigliano River, the outpost of the main German front line. The US military is now holding its newly acquired positions to block the German counterattack. The situation in the central Apennines has not changed. The enemy has repeatedly attacked Ortona in the east of the area without success. On the Adriatic coast, British troops have reached various points on the Moro River. The pressure of the British Eighth Army on the eastern flank is not as strong as that of the US military on the western flank. This is probably because the British heavy artillery has not been transported to the front. Heavy rain and the German minefields have caused great difficulties for transportation.</p>
<h3>Pétain Declares Continued Rule</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to Reuters, a spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry said yesterday in response to inquiries from foreign reporters that the German authorities were unaware of General Pétain's statement that he would continue to govern. This statement does not conflict with the current situation. The spokesman also said that French Prime Minister Laval also participated in the talks between General Pétain and German Ambassador Abetz. No other details were disclosed.</p>
<h3>Berlin Zoo Destroyed in Air Raid</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: During the recent terrorist air raid on the German capital by British and American planes, the Berlin Zoo was destroyed, and many animals died. The elephant house was bombed, and nine of the ten giant elephants died. The aquarium was directly hit, and snakes and fish were buried in the ashes. Many lions, tigers, and leopards were also bombed to death. At the same time, one polar bear had to be euthanized due to severe injuries. All but one giraffe had to be euthanized. Many red deer, antelopes, and monkeys were also bombed to death. At the same time, a large birdcage was partially destroyed.</p>
<h3>Turkish Prime Minister Scheduled to Deliver Speech</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 8th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: Turkish Prime Minister Saraçoğlu will deliver a speech during the annual Savings Week, which is scheduled for the 12th of this month. Turkish political circles attach great importance to this speech, as it is expected that he will discuss Turkey's relationship with the world situation.</p>
<h3>German Home Front Determined Not to Waver Goebbels Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – Reuters reports: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered a speech at the "German Railway Workers' Day" rally held here yesterday, saying that terrorist threats or promises are not enough to dampen the spirit of the German people and their resistance. Under any circumstances, the German home front will never be divided. This is our only opinion on the Tehran Conference. Our enemies are not appealing to the German people because they know that this appeal will be difficult to achieve. Finally, Goebbels expressed his gratitude to the German railway workers for their achievements in difficult times and said that unconditional or unconditional surrender would not be accepted by the German people.</p>
<h3>The Collapse of the Enemy's General Counteroffensive: A Dialogue Between the Naval Press Section Chief and the Army Press Section Chief of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters (Part 2)</h3>
<p>The Relationship Between War Results and the War Situation</p>
<p>Colonel Matsumura: War results and the war situation are different, and this is also the case from the Navy's perspective. I will now give a rough overview of the enemy's counteroffensive. Roosevelt stated in his memorandum: "Regarding Japan, it is necessary to repeatedly attack various points of its national defense circle from all directions simultaneously." After the Quebec Conference, Churchill reported to Parliament that British forces were launching in Burma. Since October 7th, Mountbatten has been to New Delhi to assume the position of Supreme Commander of Southeast Asia, and recently has either visited Chongqing to meet Chiang Kai-shek or flown to Cairo to attend meetings, engaging in various activities. After the end of the rainy season, due to the previous tragedy in Arakan, today's preparations are extremely cautious, building airfields, laying roads, requisitioning ships, proceeding steadily and cautiously, and the bombing of Burma is becoming increasingly intense. According to the current situation, Mountbatten's counteroffensive seems to be at the end of this year or the beginning of next year. As for the second counteroffensive, it is MacArthur's counteroffensive, centered on Australia, aimed at New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. As Navy's Tashiro-kun warned earlier, currently Timor, Ambon, Aroe, and other places are under constant surveillance, and there are occasional air raids by more than ten aircraft. In addition, there is Nimitz's counteroffensive, which is aimed at the Gilbert Islands. The purpose, as Knox said, is to attack the Marshall Islands and shorten the US-Australian communication line. In short, with India and the Pacific as the stage, just as Roosevelt's memorandum mentioned, entering the second year of the war, we will simultaneously face strong counteroffensives from three directions, which can be clearly anticipated.</p>
<p>Colonel Kurihara: That's indeed the case. I had thought that once the rainy season ended, the Burma counteroffensive would come, but who knew the result would be "hearing the sound of footsteps but not seeing anyone come down the stairs." However, the fighting in New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and the Gilbert Islands has been quite lively. Fortunately, as the Imperial Headquarters has announced on several occasions, in the Bougainville area, from the naval battle off Bougainville Island to the first to fifth air battles, many aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, and other vessels have been sunk or destroyed, and considerable damage has been inflicted on enemy aircraft. After the situation there calmed down somewhat, their counteroffensive against the Gilbert Islands began again. Fortunately, considerable damage has also been inflicted on enemy fleets. The purpose of this counteroffensive, as just mentioned, is to put pressure on the Marshall Islands area. They claim that this is the first step in attacking the Japanese mainland and that it can shorten the US-Australian communication line. However, our war results, as you know, are truly great war results since Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. However, the enemy's counteroffensive on Bougainville Island has a very significant impact on the so-called Pacific war situation.</p>
<p>This means that in the battle for air bases, the acquisition of air bases is a very important issue. Similarly, regarding the Gilbert Islands, the enemy's landing on Tarawa Island and Makin Island is indeed no small matter. This point, I think, is precisely the problem of carefully considering war results and the war situation.</p>
<p>Landing Points Difficult to Reinforce</p>
<p>Colonel Matsumura: Although we inflicted serious blows on them tactically, they advanced their bases strategically, which is extremely regrettable. In fact, since the major battle of Guadalcanal, they have conducted such tests in Rentba, New Georgia, Bougainville, and other places, and their method is exactly the same: forming aircraft carrier groups and landing under the cover of bombing and naval gunfire. The landing sites are chosen where Japanese forces are extremely thinly deployed. This time, in the Bougainville Island area, although the Navy inflicted considerable damage, the enemy forces that slipped through still landed secretly. The reason why the war situation in that area is not good is that the Solomon Islands are sparsely populated, culturally backward, and there is hardly a decent road on the islands. Even on Bougainville Island, near the Torokina landing site, there were not many Japanese troops stationed, and they were subjected to intense naval gunfire and bombing, but the survivors still fought hard, sinking dozens of enemy landing craft. Torokina, where the American forces landed, is flanked by extremely swampy areas and backed by mountains and dense forests. Therefore, it is quite difficult to use trucks to transport large forces in a timely manner to the enemy's landing site, to put pressure on them and prevent them from gaining a foothold on the shore. They are striving to build an airfield and have also deployed a considerable number of aircraft. As they themselves say, "advancing is difficult." Land advances seem to have little hope. They probably want to create a flying base there to hinder Japanese supplies. In other words, it is the so-called supply war.</p>
<p>Creating an air base on an island makes connections and supply difficult, which is not only seen in this island battle on the ocean. In an uncivilized place where the population is less than one person per square kilometer, there is not even a proper road, and coastal communication relies solely on small boats, so reinforcements cannot immediately reach the landing site. Therefore, after we received the report of the enemy landing at Torokina, the troops rushing to the scene walked for two full days in the 20-kilometer dense forest. During this time, the enemy was able to unload artillery and tanks, consolidate their positions, and establish themselves on the shore. They also built an airfield, and as a result, the range of aircraft influence expanded northward.</p>
<p>The Purpose of Establishing Bases</p>
<p>Duane, the US Air Force commander on Bougainville Island, declared that if the US forces gain a foothold at Torokina, the Japanese forces will not be able to withdraw or resupply. Therefore, they only seek to secure a point on the island. It seems that although the Navy has achieved such great war results, the enemy forces that slipped through still landed and gained a foothold.</p>
<p>Colonel Kurihara: Yes. In fact, cutting off the enemy's supply line is indeed the most important thing. We are now working hard to cut off the supplies of the enemy forces landed at Torokina. However, it is still necessary to win in the fierce air battles and seize air and sea control for this work. Therefore, it is necessary to have a considerable number of aircraft. In the end, I think the problem is still the number of aircraft.</p>
<p>The Number of Aircraft and Air Supremacy</p>
<p>Colonel Matsumura: Yes. In the end, it is still a matter of aircraft. If most of the time each day were under our air supremacy, we could certainly restrain them with great effort.</p>
<p>Colonel Kurihara: Indeed, indeed. From this, we know that the problem of the number of aircraft is indeed a very important issue. In short, to seize air supremacy, a considerable number of aircraft is necessary. When the aircraft of both sides encounter each other, the friendly aircraft that shot down some enemy aircraft have to return to base due to fuel and other reasons. At this time, if there are many aircraft, then when some aircraft return to base for replenishment, another batch of fresh air force can be dispatched, so that air supremacy can be maintained at all times.</p>
<p>The American method of operation relies entirely on absolute numerical superiority. Therefore, when the aircraft of both sides meet, although the American aircraft are driven away, they cannot stay in the air for a long time due to the nature of the aircraft, and the result is that they have to return to base. Therefore, even if air supremacy is obtained, it is only for a very few hours during the day. As a result, after this period, the other side sends fresh troops to operate.</p>
<p>Therefore, no matter what, air supremacy is held by the side with the most aircraft. Due to this reason, the supply war cannot be carried out as ideally as possible. When thinking about such things, I hope that the people will be more serious about the increased production of aircraft.</p>
<p>Colonel Matsumura: In fact, the Navy has already overcome difficulties such as thin clouds and dawn, and has struck the US Navy and destroyed enemy air power. Therefore, as long as there is an equal air force, air supremacy will belong to us. However, due to the large number of enemy aircraft, most of the time each day air supremacy falls into the hands of the other side, so that supply and other things become very difficult. To reverse this situation, intercept the enemy's counteroffensive, and defeat the enemy, we hope to have more aircraft no matter what.</p>
<p>Colonel Kurihara: Exactly. Absolutely!</p>
<p>General Conditions of Air Combat in the South</p>
<p>Colonel Matsumura: The American Air Force's attack tactics in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands generally take the method of group attacks, relying solely on numbers, and attacking in batches. After one attack team returns, another considerable number of aircraft flies in after two or three hours, and they do this continuously. Therefore, although our side initially soars into the sky, defending against their attacks, and engaging them in aerial warfare, but later, due to running out of gasoline and ammunition, we have to come down; at this time, the enemy's fresh troops have flown in to attack, and the battle will of course be very difficult and unfavorable. Moreover, the enemy also sends many reconnaissance aircraft, flying everywhere, and once they discover a good target, they use the phrase "Sometimes the opportunity is there, but there is no aircraft!" In short, opportunities are always there, but unfortunately there are no aircraft to seize the opportunity. The state of the Southern Front is so tragic!</p>
<p>Their ground forces have no spirit of active attack. Relying on quantity, they rely entirely on thorough bombing and firepower. After seizing a corner, they immediately build an airfield and continuously transport aircraft to cut off the supply line. In the battles in that area, our officers and soldiers will never lose to them, it is just that the supply gradually becomes inadequate, so although they have not been defeated, they still have to move their positions unwillingly, which is indeed regrettable! This is what we have experienced since Guadalcanal. On the battle lines in that area, soldiers are bombarded by enemy forces every day. As a result, according to officers recently returning home, the front-line soldiers are very worried about their own aircraft, and issue the cry "What on earth is happening to Japanese aircraft?" In short, as long as there are aircraft, they can be forced back. Aircraft, aircraft, we need aircraft!</p>
<p>The Production Volume of American Aircraft</p>
<p>Colonel Kurihara: Next, please have Colonel Matsumura talk about the production status of American aircraft.</p>
<p>Colonel Matsumura: After suffering a terrible defeat in the initial battles, the United States converted most of its automobile factories into aircraft subcontracting factories, and added aircraft factories, frantically manufacturing aircraft and warships, using stockpiled raw materials and industrial power, desperately striving, and then shouting for counteroffensives and counteroffensives. This year, Roosevelt declared in his memorandum that the production volume of aircraft would be 125,000, but in reality it is around 90,000, about 80,000 to 90,000.</p>
<p>Colonel Kurihara: 90,000 is roughly correct, right?</p>
<p>Colonel Matsumura: A few days ago, according to Asahi Shimbun's Hosokawa-kun, who recently returned from Buenos Aires, the enemy did not establish a material mobilization plan, and was doing things at random, so abnormal conditions occurred in terms of materials, and the situation regarding labor problems was particularly bad, so that the angle of increase in production has gradually decreased since this summer. Before this, although it was rapidly increasing, the summer and autumn of this year have been quite stagnant. (Yoshida: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, December 4)</p>
<p>The Aerial Decisive Battle on the Continent</p>
<p>After the Quebec Conference, the enemy intensified their counteroffensive, attacking both north and south in the Pacific, and increasing their troops on the Indian border. They are making every effort to use their air force to bomb the Japanese mainland. It is estimated that the strength of the US Air Force stationed in China, including those on the coast, is approximately 500 aircraft.</p>
<p>Under the command of the commander of the 14th Air Force stationed in Chongqing, the central base has been moved from Kunming to Jianchuan, using airfields in Guizhou as relay bases, and strengthening other airfields, so that they become forward bases for attacking the Japanese mainland.</p>
<p>This diagram, with Tokyo, Japan as the center, shows the range of action of aircraft. Aircraft with a cruising range of 6,000 kilometers or more are required to reach Tokyo without refueling. According to the current situation, the strength of the US Air Force stationed in China is insufficient for this.</p>

<h3>The Second Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War: Celebration Ceremony Held, Over Two Thousand Representatives from Various Countries Attended</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch: Yesterday marked the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. To commemorate this historically significant day, the Greater East Asia War Second Anniversary Commemoration Executive Committee held a celebration ceremony for representatives from various countries of the Co-Prosperity Sphere at the Paramount Theater on Jing'an Temple Road in this city yesterday (the 8th) afternoon at 3:00 PM. Those in attendance included Mayor Chen Gongbo, Minister Tajiri from the allied nations, German Consul General Fischer, Consul General Ye Yao Gong from Manchukuo, and Army Minister Nagatsu. Also present were Rear Admiral Kondo from the Japanese Naval Attache Office, Hirota, head of the Information Section of the Japanese Embassy, as well as over two thousand representatives from various countries, including eight nations: China, Japan, Germany, Manchukuo, the Philippines, Burma, Thailand, and India. The event was unprecedentedly grand and enthusiastic. The assembly began promptly at 3:00 PM. Following speeches by Minister Tajiri of Japan, Mayor Chen, Consul General Fischer of Germany, Consul General Ye Yao Gong of Manchukuo, Army Minister Nagatsu, and Rear Admiral Kondo, the assembly ceremony concluded. Afterwards, newsreels such as "The Great Unity of the Greater East Asian Peoples" and the "Greater East Asia War Second Anniversary Cultural Film" were screened, and the meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Speech by Minister Tajiri</p>
<p>I am delighted to celebrate the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War and hold this grand commemorative ceremony. Representatives from the Republic of China, Manchukuo, Germany, and various countries of Greater East Asia are all present. I feel very honored. In the past two years, the Greater East Asia War has expelled the forces of British and American aggression from the lands of Greater East Asia, realizing the liberation of Greater East Asia, and Greater East Asia has entered a stage of construction. Japan and the Republic of China have concluded the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, establishing a permanent friendly relationship. The single-minded and unified relationship between Japan and Manchukuo is also becoming increasingly profound. Furthermore, in the south, the alliance between Japan and Thailand is becoming stronger. Following the newly born nation of Burma, the Philippines has also been established, and the day when India completes its independence is not far off. The Greater East Asia Conference held previously in Tokyo has promoted the determination of the one billion people of Greater East Asia to cooperate in consolidating unity and to complete the construction of a new order in the Greater East Asia War. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration can be called the grand charter for building a new order in Greater East Asia. I am confident that the construction of a new Greater East Asia will take great strides forward due to this declaration. In this way, it can be expected that in the third year of the Greater East Asia War, the construction of Greater East Asia will develop even more rapidly, and defeating the British and Americans will surely be successful. If we look again at the European front, our ally Germany is displaying amazing combat power, defeating the anti-Axis front. At the same time, the construction of a new European order is progressing daily. We express our deep respect for the great achievements and unwavering fighting spirit of our allies. On this second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, we hope that the nations of Greater East Asia will consolidate their unity further, strengthen cooperation with our ally Germany, and resolve to complete the Greater East Asia War and achieve final victory.</p>
<p>Speech by Mayor Chen</p>
<p>Gentlemen: Today is the second anniversary commemoration of the Greater East Asia War, and it can also be said to be a victory celebration in advance for the Greater East Asia War. Although the war has not yet ended, for the whole of Greater East Asia, the forces of Britain and America have already been eliminated. Burma and the Philippines have already become independent. The people of Malaya and Java have obtained the right to participate in government. The Provisional Government of Free India has been established, and the three hundred million oppressed people of India have the dawn of liberation. As far as China is concerned, all concessions have been recovered. Extraterritorial rights in China have been abolished. The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty has been signed. The Boxer Protocol has been abolished. Unequal treaties have been abolished. Therefore, although the Greater East Asia War has not yet ended, the liberation of the nations of Greater East Asia is about to be completed. Although the war is not over, the essence of the war has already been won. That is why I call today's commemoration a victory celebration in advance for the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Today, people from various countries of Greater East Asia and representatives from various allied nations are participating in this commemoration. Therefore, in addressing you, I will speak solely from the perspective of China and examine the general situation of China. We must strengthen our forces to participate in the war and determine our direction.</p>
<p>First, the Republic of China joined the Greater East Asia War on January 9th of this year. This significance is very great. Our participation in the war is not only for the sake of our own liberation but also for the sake of the liberation of all the nations of East Asia. Now, China's concessions have all been recovered, extraterritorial rights have also been abolished, and China's unequal treaties no longer exist. China's liberation has been realized. However, we Chinese should examine how much effort we have exerted in this participation in the war. We have not yet sent troops to the front lines for the Greater East Asia War, but we are preparing to do so. We do not want to participate in the war in name only; we want to participate with real strength. Therefore, I hope that our people will intensify their organization and training so that when something happens, they can take up arms and go to the battlefield at any time. In the rear, they can maintain order, establish security, and make all necessary preparations.</p>
<p>Second, we not only seek our own independence but also further seek the independence of all the nations of East Asia. Burma and the Philippines have already become independent, and we should support them. The Provisional Government of India has also been established, and we should support it even more vigorously. The previous visit to China by Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, was to seek China's sympathy and assistance. I acknowledge that if India is not independent, the national liberation of Greater East Asia is not yet complete. If India is still in the hands of Britain and America, the crisis for the nations of Greater East Asia still exists. I call on the citizens of the Republic of China to provide India with the greatest possible assistance. If there is anyone who advocates cooperation with Britain and America to destroy the freedom of India, we should stop them and eliminate them. Moreover, I call on the soldiers of the subjugated army who are scattered in India to immediately rise up and cooperate with Bose's army to fight against Britain and America to complete the national liberation of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Third, since we have participated in the war, we should strive to fulfill our responsibilities, especially to exert our own abilities. Strength comes from concentration. Therefore, we must further unify China. By unification, I mean, on the one hand, overall peace and, on the other hand, especially striving for political, military, and economic unification under the National Government. Demanding national unification is the responsibility of every citizen and the right of every citizen. Only by concentrating our strength can we contribute to the Greater East Asia War. Only by concentrating our strength can we revive China.</p>
<p>Fourth, increasing production is our unanimous demand. Increasing production is, on the one hand, to supply military needs to the soldiers at the front and, on the other hand, to supply necessities to the people in the rear. We also know that during wartime, raw materials will be scarce, and power will also be reduced. However, we will never stop production because of the lack of raw materials. On the contrary, we should seek raw materials because of the lack of raw materials. We will also never reduce production because of the reduction of power. On the contrary, we should work harder to increase power because of the reduction of power.</p>
<p>In short, we are determined to win the Greater East Asia War, and we are determined to complete the national liberation of Greater East Asia. We have such determination and also possess unparalleled perseverance. We must prepare for a long-term war, and we must prepare for a long-term struggle. Today, at this commemoration, we celebrate in advance the victory of the Greater East Asia War and the success of the liberation of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Speech by the German Consul General</p>
<p>In his brief speech, the German Consul General emphasized the important significance of holding the commemoration, praising the close unity between Japan and Germany today, like cities facing each other, preparing with unwavering determination to resist the attack of a common enemy. The two countries are filled with the same ideals and are advancing shoulder to shoulder towards victory. Germany and Japan are fighting to protect the right to exist, so they will surely win, he said.</p>
<p>Speech by the Consul General of Manchukuo</p>
<p>Today, we joyfully celebrate the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. It is a great honor for me to be able to participate in and deliver a speech at this grand commemorative ceremony. It has been two years since the Japanese army began the great war. During this period, from the attack on Pearl Harbor to the subjugation of the Malay Peninsula and the capture of Singapore, to the recent attacks on Bougainville Island and the Gilbert Islands, fierce battles have been waged, causing the enemy, Britain and America, to suffer repeated defeats and punishments, and demonstrating the spirit of "Hakkō ichiu" (the eight corners of the world under one roof) at home and abroad. This is truly due to the Japanese army's exceptional spirit, lengthy silent and arduous training, and overcoming of various objective disadvantages, which has led to this valuable gift. Therefore, the Greater East Asia War has become a certainty of victory. At the same time, the foundation for the construction of our East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is as solid as a rock. It is a well-known fact that such amazing achievements of Japan will surely bear fruit. The two Axis countries of East Asia, Manchukuo and China, are of course included, as well as the emerging countries of Burma, the Philippines, and Free India, which constitute the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. I believe that they will be able to jointly maintain close cooperation to contribute to the stability of the overall situation in East Asia. And with the belief of certain victory and rock-solid unity, they will carry out rear tasks and move towards increased production.</p>
<p>Speech by Military Attaché Kondo</p>
<p>Today, the Greater East Asia War enters its third year. I feel extremely honored to be able to participate in today's grand ceremony with China, Japan, and representatives from various countries of Greater East Asia and Germany. The outbreak of the Greater East Asia War was due to Britain and America using the beautiful name of peace to pursue their ambition to invade East Asia and imposing economic and military pressure on Japan. This runs counter to Japan's great national ideal, where all nations get their due place. Japan, in order to eliminate aggression and uphold justice, has led the one billion people of East Asia to rise up resolutely.</p>
<p>Upon initiating hostilities with Britain and America, the Japanese army fought bravely and skillfully. In less than half a year after the start of the war, it drove out and swept away the forces of British and American aggression in East Asia, which had lasted for a century. In the subsequent year and four months, it crushed and annihilated the enemies' so-called total counter-offensive everywhere, and crushed the enemy's combat power. At the same time as the battle, the construction of Greater East Asia is also progressing step by step. The bond between Japan and Manchukuo is becoming increasingly solid. The alliance between China, Japan, and Thailand has been renewed to complete joint operations and has formed a close relationship. In addition, the Philippines and Burma, which have been humiliated for years under the brutal rule, fraud, and exploitation of Britain and America, have also embarked on a new path of light. The Indian people have also resolved to rise up and carry out a war of liberation. Today, the one billion people of Greater East Asia have jointly made the decision to exert all their strength to defeat their old enemies, Britain and America, in order to make Greater East Asia an eternal paradise. Recalling November 5, the representatives of the six countries of Greater East Asia jointly issued the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. This declaration clarified this determination to the world and inflicted a major blow on Britain and America, who have no war aims whatsoever and are driven solely by ambition. Looking at the current situation, the enemies in the central and southern Pacific have repeatedly counterattacked. The result of the battle is only that valuable ships and precious lives have sunk to the bottom of the sea. In the Indian Ocean and on the Chinese mainland, the enemy has no room for manoeuvre due to the close cooperation between the Japanese army and navy.</p>
<p>Recently, the enemy's damage in the Bougainville Island and Gilbert Islands areas has been shocking. But why do these enemies continue to counterattack at all costs? This is because they fear the growing strength of Japan's combat power. The enemy knows very well that Japan has ample time to put them in an irreparable predicament. Therefore, it can be expected that the enemy's counterattacks, whether in the South Pacific or the Indian Ocean, will become more and more intense in the future. But we are deeply convinced that the results achieved in the half-year after the start of the war and the power of the combined strength of the entire East Asian nation will surely achieve final victory and complete the construction of Greater East Asia. As the holy war enters its third year, I pray that the East Asian nations will work together with one heart, fight bravely, and struggle hard.</p>

<h3>Yu Senting Donates Repaid Loan to Help Students; Master Kuzhai Donates 2,000 Yuan from Book Sales</h3>
<p>This newspaper received a letter yesterday from Mr. Yu Senting stating: More than ten years ago, I borrowed 2,000 taels of silver from my close friend Mr. Wu Nanpu. Mr. Wu has been living in seclusion in the countryside for a long time, and I have been unable to ascertain his exact address through inquiries. Mr. Wu is known to be wealthy and has never demanded repayment of the loan, but I have felt uneasy about using the money for many years. Therefore, I have ordered my son, Jia Peng, to convert the amount into 3,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes, add an additional 2,000 yuan, making a total of 5,000 yuan, and allocate it as a student aid fund to benefit Mr. Wu. In addition, Master Kuzhai supports student aid and benefits the poor students. He has donated large sums of money in the past and yesterday donated 2,000 yuan from the sales of the Baofu Method, which is deeply admirable. Here is a list of the student aid funds received in the past two days: Master Kuzhai (donation from sales of Baofu Method) 2,000 yuan, Wang Boyuan 1,000 yuan, One person 1,000 yuan, Li Xingji 400 yuan, Jianjin Vocational School's Workers' Voluntary Evening School Students (donation of souvenir fee for teachers' enthusiastic teaching) 270 yuan, Wu Zhonglian 100 yuan, Sun Liji 50 yuan, Pu Jiting 10 yuan, Yu Senting (repayment of loan used for student aid) 5,000 yuan, One banking trainee (donation of bonus income used for student aid) 500 yuan, Huaide Hall 100 yuan, Mrs. Pu Jiting 10 yuan, total received Central Reserve Bank notes 10,440 yuan, balance 1,148,543 yuan.</p>

<p>Economic Circle Commentary</p>
<h3>Reflections on the Year-End Closing Period</h3>
<p>The year-end closing period for the silver and money industries is approaching in a blink of an eye. As a result, all industries limit all loans, such as current account overdrafts and credit loans, to be cleared before the year-end closing period, and new loans during the year-end closing period are temporarily suspended as usual. At the same time, although the Bank Joint Reserve Association and the Money Industry Joint Reserve Department can do their best to accommodate the interbank lending of banks and firms, it must be limited to the legitimate uses of each bank and firm. Therefore, we feel that the silver and money industry can be said to be faithfully implementing the self-inspection and self-insurance system during the year-end closing period, and refusing all speculative loans.</p>
<p>Due to the self-discipline and self-insurance policy of the silver and money industry during this period, we are reminded of how important the regular system of the wartime financial industry is in relation to the entire industry and people's livelihood. The reason why the trend of speculation, hoarding, monopoly, and manipulation has subsided slightly in the past one or two months is because the authorities have launched a comprehensive investigation and crackdown, and also because of the restrictions on informal and illegal lending by the silver and money industry. Therefore, when discussing prices again yesterday, we believed that restricting price disturbances from the monetary and financial aspects is still a price policy that draws firewood from under the cauldron. In a word, we feel that the investment direction of the financial industry is most likely to affect a country's production and living conditions. Therefore, those who talk about financial control during wartime pay attention to the management of bank loans, especially the regular management of bank loans. Only in this way can speculation be eliminated, and only in this way can production investment be discussed.</p>
<h3>Qualification of Directors and Supervisors of Various Associations to be Reviewed; Statutory Number May Not Be Arbitrarily Increased or Decreased</h3>
<p>The various trade associations in this city have been reorganized as of the 19th, and the directors and supervisors responsible for association affairs have also been elected separately. The relevant authorities, in view of the fact that although the institutions of various associations have been established in order, they still cannot complete the tasks of the association and achieve the spirit of commercial autonomy without the promotion of good personnel. Although the directors and supervisors of various trade associations are elected publicly in accordance with the law, it is inevitable that there are still a few unqualified personnel mixed in. Therefore, the relevant authorities will review the qualifications of the directors and supervisors of various associations. Anyone who meets one of the following conditions may not be a director or supervisor: Those who are not in the industry, those who have been deprived of public rights, those who have violated national policies and have been punished for criminal offenses by the court, those who have been declared bankrupt and have not yet been restored to their rights, those who have been expelled from the association, those who lack the ability to act. In addition to reviewing the qualifications of directors and supervisors, the authorities also consider the number of people. The number of directors and supervisors of each association must meet the statutory number and may not be arbitrarily increased or decreased.</p>
<h3>Six Temporary Special Taxes to be Levied in Eastern Zhejiang</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Ningbo: The Taxation Bureau, affiliated with the Ministry of Finance, announced to the counties of eastern Zhejiang the other day that it would begin levying temporary special taxes on six categories of goods, including tung oil, tea, pork bristles, poultry feathers, sugar, and cosmetics, starting immediately. It also announced the tax rates and payment procedures for each item, ordering businesses in each industry to comply.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on Sales of Goods by Fellow Traders</h3>
<p>In recent weeks, the authorities have appeared to be extremely calm on the surface regarding the management of prices, but in reality, they have never relaxed. They continue to implement their consistent policy of strictly enforcing price limits and investigating hoarding. The authorities believe that the high cost is the main reason for the high prices, but the successive sales and mutual profits have invisibly increased the buyer's costs. When selling, they will naturally raise prices. Therefore, in order to completely flatten prices, the sales of businessmen in various industries should also be strictly managed. This reporter learned from various trade associations yesterday that the authorities have formulated the following restrictions on sales by fellow traders: When a vendor sells goods to a firm, the firm must sell the goods to a shop engaged in such items, and then the shop will display the goods in the store for normal users to choose from. Absolutely no sales between firms or between shops are allowed. Once a sale is made, a transaction order must be issued for the authorities to check when necessary, and a receipt must be issued for sales in the store to prevent abuses.</p>
<h3>Summary of Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Government Bonds: Yesterday's prices remained weak. The number of participants at gatherings continued to dwindle, and professional traders had completely disappeared. Only a very few counterparties remained, inquiring about prices and engaging in limited trading. Yesterday, Class C bonds initially opened higher, but then declined. By midday, the final price was slightly lower than the previous day. Class A bonds saw the biggest drop. Class B and D bonds only had quoted prices, but no transactions occurred due to the large price differences. Class E bonds also declined significantly, with little prospect of recovery.</p>
<p>Interbank Loan Rate: Yesterday morning, the Money Trade Association's interbank loan rate remained unchanged at 1.8%.</p>
<p>Grains: The amount of grain arriving in Shanghai yesterday was relatively small due to transportation delays along the route. This led sellers to try to raise prices, and market conditions became firm. Glutinous rice prices increased several levels compared to the previous day. Ordinary rice also saw a rise in price. Trading in oilseeds was scarce, and prices also tended to be firm.</p>
<p>Artificial Silk: Trading remained slow yesterday, and the market showed a gradual downward trend. Prices fell slightly again, with 120 Denier Tianqiao at 6.575, trending downward.</p>
<p>Northern Goods: The supply of goods from the north has been quite active recently. However, actual sales are fragmented and lack volume. Trading remains lackluster, and prices show a weak attempt to rally.</p>

<h3>Second Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>— Captain Shioda</p>
<p>The lesson the enemy has learned from this initial stage of the war is that air power has become almost the deciding factor in modern naval warfare. It also seems to have gained significant lessons in the modification of submarines.</p>
<p>Thus, the initial stage of the war has led the British and Americans to make significant changes to their naval forces and their composition. After the pre-war naval forces were defeated, new fleets suitable for the new strategies were deployed.</p>
<p>This new deployment, or rather counter-offensive, can be seen in the various naval battles currently unfolding in various theaters. So, what is the current state of naval warfare after the initial stage? The maximum increase in air force strength, air force fire and air strike operations, and the adoption of submarine tactics to disrupt Japan's production and transportation lines. In other words, actively and passively, they are engaging in counter-offensive operations from the air and from the water. After years of research, the United States has finally used aircraft carriers instead of battleships in its so-called trans-oceanic wheel formation against Japan, as seen in the recent naval and air battles of Bougainville and the Gilbert Islands. They are launching counter-offensives with two to three aircraft carriers at the core, escorted by battleships and cruisers.</p>
<p>Before the beginning of this year, enemy aircraft attacked in formations averaging 80 planes. By September, the average attack in the Pacific region was by large formations of about 300 planes. Since then, they have constantly launched air strikes with combined fighter-bomber formations of 150 or more planes.</p>
<p>These large formations first bomb Japanese positions, and then amphibious tanks lead various vessels in landing operations.</p>
<p>As for the enemy's submarine activities, the enemy has made maximum efforts to improve submarines and train personnel. At the same time, they are providing submarine crews with the best possible treatment. Therefore, submarine activity is more aggressive than when the war broke out. There is no shortage of brave men among their crews, so we must be even more vigilant against their movements.</p>
<p>In short, the nature of modern naval warfare is greatly influenced by aircraft and submarines. At the same time, no one can deny that the countless islands in the South Seas also have a major impact on modern naval warfare.</p>
<p>From the above-mentioned characteristics of naval warfare, it can be seen that future naval battles in the Pacific will be battles of great attrition, great replenishment, and great production.</p>
<p>Next, I will analyze the limits of American military production capacity and explain why production is such a crucial factor in battle.</p>
<p>The greatest feature of all the battles currently unfolding in the Gilbert Islands and the Solomon Islands is base-to-base offensive and defensive warfare, or, in Roosevelt's words, "island hopping." These islands are 2,600 to 2,700 miles from Tokyo, 4,300 miles from San Francisco in the United States, and 1,500 to 2,000 miles from Hawaii. Both Japan and the United States must rely on rear-area replenishment. Therefore, the rear area must have an extremely large replenishment source and a strong transportation capacity. Replenishment capacity and transportation capacity are the keys to victory. Therefore, victory on the front lines depends on the victory of the people in the rear, and the results of the front lines are the results of the rear.</p>
<p>First, regarding replenishment capacity, American production capacity peaked in May and June of this year, and subsequent production capacity has not increased. This is completely consistent with our pre-war research: that the United States would reach its peak production capacity by 1943. The military supplies seized before the war from the South and other regions were largely used up by the end of 1943. Second, due to labor and other factors, it can be determined that production replenishment capacity will not increase from the end of this year. But in fact, this phenomenon was already apparent half a year earlier, from June of this year. No matter how hard War Production Board Chairman Donald Nelson tries, no matter how much Knox brags, the shortage of production materials and the shortage of labor are all difficult problems. Tungsten is a necessary raw material for alloy production. It is a unique product of South China and Burma, accounting for 70% of the world's reserves. American tungsten production is less than one-third of peacetime needs. The United States relies only on imports from South America, which account for less than 10% of the world's reserves. It is not without reason that the United States is imitating what Japan did before the war and is trying to manufacture wooden airplanes. Regarding steel, iron, copper, and aluminum, the so-called three important controlled materials of the United States, wartime production of 8.8 million tons this year has decreased to 3 million tons. Chairman Nelson said, "The steel production capacity of the United States has reached its peak, and it is very difficult to increase it further." Knox also said, "The production of everything from warships to aircraft is quite difficult due to the shortage of materials centered on steel."</p>
<p>Furthermore, rubber, which is indispensable for carrying out the war, is 90% produced in the Malay region. Therefore, the United States has banned civilian use of rubber due to its inability to obtain it and is engaged in the manufacture of synthetic rubber. Rubber Control Officer William Jeffers has taken decisive measures in the domestic control of rubber, prohibiting any increase in consumption. The United States had a rubber reserve of 700,000 tons before the war. Most of it was used last year, and it is doubtful whether even one ton will remain by the end of this year. Moreover, Japan has turned natural rubber into highly volatile aircraft fuel, and the current anxiety of the United States is not difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>As for petroleum, the United States consumes 40,000,000 barrels more than it produces domestically. The United States has no tin production, while the South produces 90% of the world's supply. Furthermore, quinine, which is indispensable in tropical warfare, is 98% produced in the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the United States, with its shortage of production materials, will not have a higher production output for aircraft and ships next year than this year. It can be seen that the United States' production replenishment capacity peaked this year. U.S. Navy Board of Materials Input Minister Volsh said, "Of the 11.4 million tons of merchant shipping the U.S. possessed before the war, One year after the start of the war, most of it was lost." Furthermore, the shipbuilding volume, which had been increasing from last year until May of this year, has gradually decreased after June. The same goal is to reach 20 million tons. This is not to say that the United States does not need a shipbuilding target of more than 20 million tons, but rather that the United States has reached its maximum possible shipbuilding capacity (continued on the fourth page).</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<h3>The Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>(Continued from page 3)</p>
<p>Currently, it takes 20 tons of shipping capacity to transport one soldier. Therefore, it requires 5 million tons of shipping space to transport 500,000 troops, and another two tons of shipping space are needed for replenishment for each soldier. Based on these calculations, it initially requires 5 million tons to dispatch 500,000 troops to the front lines, and then constantly requires 1 million tons of shipping space. If the time required for ship maintenance and the losses from sinkings are added, one-third of the fleet is unusable. Given these considerations, the enemy's deployable forces are also limited. In terms of population, that is, military manpower, the total population of the United States is 130 million. If women, children, blacks, and laborers are removed, the maximum number that can be mobilized is only 3 million.</p>
<p>This is taking the enemy's example to explain Japan's future production capacity and replenishment capacity. In short, America's combat strength reached its peak this year. Conversely, Japan can start a real war from next year. In this respect, although the combat readiness is one and a half years behind the enemy, the Japanese Navy, which annihilated all of the enemy's pre-war battleships, aircraft carriers, and cruisers, is still unharmed. The enemy's ships currently in the Pacific are almost entirely newly built. But the Japanese Navy is still standing in wait, prepared for a decisive battle. The damage inflicted on the enemy at Bougainville is estimated at 23 battleships, 30 aircraft carriers, and 98 cruisers. In addition, if we add the other various ships destroyed, the enemy has bled a lot. And the loss of personnel is a fatal blow. A military commentator, Hanson Baldwin, published an article in the New York Times on October 22nd saying: "The US has built 19 million tons of ships", of which about 3 million tons are condemned ships, and he also stated: "The US has 21 battleships, 12 to 15 aircraft carriers, and a number of auxiliary and escort aircraft carriers and aircraft transport ships." Even if it is true, it is not surprising compared to the current state of American production capacity and the recent marked increase in the Japanese naval air force.</p>
<h3>The Strong Japanese Navy</h3>
<p>Approximately seven months after Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto died in battle against the enemy on a plane in the South Seas, the officers and men of the Japanese Navy are now led by Admiral Koga, the incomparably brave successor to the late Admiral. On this anniversary of the start of the war, we would like to express our complete trust and respect to the Admiral and the officers and men of the Navy. For the past two years, they have consistently achieved great victories against an enemy that is dozens of times stronger. Yet they remain unshaken. They do not boast of their achievements, but silently march towards battle. We must prepare the naval officers and men for battle deployment and a decisive engagement as soon as possible.</p>
<p>After seventy years of intensive training, we have finally reached this day. The Japanese Navy, after three years of war, has high expectations for its future brave struggles. The Japanese Navy's unshakable belief in victory, cultivated in training, and the excellence of its weapons, strategic research, and constant superiority over the enemy, starting from the Pearl Harbor attack, the air battles that will continue to be fought from now on are due to the system adopted by the Japanese Navy for the world's throne, namely the Type A, Type B, and Type C pre-training systems. This plays a very important role in the results of today's battles. In addition, with these young air force soldiers currently being trained nationwide, the magnificent state of the Japanese Navy in the third year of the war is firmly unshakable. Seeing the vigorous spirit of the young people who are constantly carrying on the legacy of their predecessors, no matter how the enemy comes to counterattack, it will only be in vain to shed a lot of blood.

<h3>The Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Toyo Iwata, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>A week had passed. On the seventh evening, the new mother, Wako, had recovered her strength as usual and was already working around the house. It would be easy to assume that a forty-four-year-old woman who had given birth to eleven children would be quite strong, but in reality, she was pitifully thin. Her complexion was pale, her skin delicate, and she had a full head of black hair, as is common among rural women. If you were to call her a beauty! High cheekbones, thick lips, and a dull, impolite expression. However, her eyes drooped at the corners, and her voice was soft, yet charmingly cute. She was originally the wife of a general store owner. Besides rice, she also sold tobacco, sundries, and shochu, so her behavior was also humble. There was no sign of strength about her anywhere. Moreover, she was a daughter of the common people, who did not know what was called "reason" and could not speak of "rights," an ordinary, traditional woman of the Satsuma region. She was a woman who was not worthy of pursuing any meaning in life other than labor, faith, and raising children.</p>
<p>"Haruko... it's almost noon."</p>
<p>She was already ordering her eldest daughter from the maternity bed.</p>
<p>"Okay!"</p>
<p>Haruko, as silent as her father, was in the kitchen in front of the maternity room, cooking sweet potatoes with soy sauce. Haruko was only seventeen years old, and during her mother's confinement, she had taken over all the cooking. Her eldest son, Shinzo, who was fifteen years old, was weak and unable to help in any way. Mitsuko, who was fourteen, and Shinichiro, who was thirteen, were able to sweep the house and deliver goods to the store, and were of some use. The most troublesome was Taro, who was two years old. In a family with many children, the housework was surprisingly well-organized. No matter which time she gave birth, there was no labor pain, and it passed smoothly.</p>
<p>"Haruko... Did you send the roasted rice cakes to the Kajiki family?"</p>
<p>"I sent a liter..."</p>
<p>The mother gave her instructions once, and then gazed peacefully at the dark and shiny ceiling boards. Although it was a house in the town, half of it was built like a farmhouse. The kitchen was quite large, including the maternity room, there were three rooms in total—although there was a small room upstairs for storing sundries, it could be used by the children for studying. In the evenings, every room would be filled with this family of thirteen. But now, it was quiet, and only the call of an owl could be heard from the beach at Yoji.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Makoto, who was sleeping next door, began to cry loudly. The mother, who was used to giving birth, knew with one listen that the child was hungry.</p>
<p>The woman opened her chest and put her nipple in the child's mouth. Her full breasts seemed out of keeping with her age. But even more astonishing were the fingers and palms holding those breasts. Her fingers and palms were as rough and large as old baseball gloves. Those were the hands of a woman who had been constantly working on all the housework for twenty years, from the time she married at the age of twenty-four until today.</p>
