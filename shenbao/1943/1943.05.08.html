<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">張案是一個嚴重社會問題 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>法捕房探員濫用刑罰致張金海寃死一案，我們曾在昨日社評中指出此案重心是法律問題，自應根據法律，將肇事人員處以應得之罪，謀求合理解決；絕不是外交問題，而牽涉中法間的友誼。現在張案家屬已經向管轄法院提出控訴，同時法總領事署經警務總監要求，業已命令領事法庭庭長予以詳細偵査，而將可以作證人員均行停止工作。我們盼望各關係方面集中觀點於法律上罪責之研究，不放鬆肇事人員脫漏法綱，以爲後來者戒。而法捕房當局，更須認淸並維護法律的尊嚴，坦白將肇事屬員交之於法庭，使此案之解決，完全導入法律範圍之內，而不致引起其他意外與不良的後果。</p>
<p>同時，我們認爲張案更是嚴重的社會問題，而非政治問題。査張案之原委，法捕房根據原告的控訴，認張金海有犯罪嫌疑，傳訉不招，繼之以刑，刑之不招，繼之以酷刑，以至於死。按用刑之目的，原爲防範狡賴者，脅以承認眞實口供，以決定案情之眞相，此種用刑有其限度。但本無其事，因企圖曲招而脅之以刑，更因不肯曲招而脅之以酷刑，此種用刑，自屬非法。我們更願坦白的指出，此種非法酷刑，就張案的經過而言，似非偶然的事。</p>
<p>試問捕房探員何以對市民脅之非法酷刑？我們的答復便涉及「弊」的問題。澈底的說，假借用刑爲手段，而遂行騙詐的目的。所以這種用刑已經變爲賄賂詐欺的勾當了。由於這種不正當目的的用刑，就發生了許許多多爾虞我詐，尋仇作對，更有所謂「裝笋頭」等等的不幸事態，形成了社會上一部分的阢陴黑暗。張案充其極，不過冒領大衣，况且是否眞實，尙待研究，那末，用重刑的目的何在，不難推想。雖未經法律判明以前，我們不能加以妄斷，而其用刑之已超過限度，毫無疑義。所以我們說張案的本身是嚴重的社會問題，而非政治問題者，理由即在此。</p>
<p>我們既經說明此種非法用刑的目的，在乎曲招，在乎欺詐，這是個嚴重的社會問題。那末爲了澈底消滅這種社會毒素，同時保障巿民的人權和法益，我們籲請負有治安責任的機關和當局，嚴密注意執行用刑人員的目的所在，廢除重刑，及改善用刑方式外，對於執行人員的品格操守，特別着重。而尤其盼望法捕房當局以張案爲轉捩，切實變革刑事部分的辦事作風。</p>
<p>巡捕就是警察，探員是警察之一種，都是負有保護市民，警衛治安的責任，與市民的關係至爲密切，他們本身應該了解與市民和衷合作，相處融洽，都是分內的事。即使巿民有不明瞭警章之處，也應善爲解釋勸導，不使誤犯與再犯，那種趾高氣揚，盛勢凌人的態度，均非所宜，警務當局，應以警察對市民的態度，爲主要的訓練科目。同時嚴加考核，列爲服務獎懲之主要項目。我們認爲惟有市民與警察眞誠合作，才可以確立圓滿的社會治安。</p>
<p>日本和德國的警察訓練，向著稱於世界。我們在日本的大都市所見警務人員對市民和藹有禮的態度，那是上海市民所夢想不到的。因此，目前我們所見的一部分警務人員與市民之間的對立情形，仇視態度，更羨慕日本警察的訓練有方。近來公共租界捕房已由友邦日本有經驗的警務人員主管，我們亟願其早日樹立模範的警政。</p>
<p>張案的解決，我們靜候法律的結論。張案以及千百未暴露的張案，是嚴重的社會問題，我們必須得到有效的改善。法捕房方面亟應速自檢束，嚴戒屬員，整飭法令，務使今後不再重見張案之發生。同時，盼望市警察局與公共租界補房以張案爲前車之鑑，而先自檢點所屬，防患於未然。巿民方面則因警務人員的觀感一新，自然樂與合作。那末民警打成一片，治安必獲良好成績：更因社會病態的消滅，而促成政治上軌道，到是極可能的事。</p>

<h3 id="c2">科列基多攻陷周年　菲島定爲「治安日」　東條首相昨遙眺該島默禱英靈　日派遣軍最高當局亦發表談話 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>馬尼刺七日中央社電日東條首相抵此後，備受菲島官民一致之熱誠歡迎。七日爲日軍攻陷科列基多島一週年紀念日，東條首相於是日晨五時半起床，盥洗畢，當即驅車至馬尼刺灣對岸，是時風平浪靜，旭日甫昇，首相遙眺浮於灣口之科列基多島，萬感交集，緬懷去年日軍在該島奮戰，武勳之餘，對護國英靈致敬虔之默禱。菲島行政府規定是日爲「治安日」，以示紀念，全島人民均歡騰若在，而與東條首相同申祝忱。馬尼刺七日中央社電日菲島派遣軍最高指揮官以本日爲攻陷科列基多島週年紀念日，特發表談話稱：一年前之今日科列基多島被日軍攻陷，自是以來，美國在菲島之支配權，始名實俱消。按菲島前受西班牙支配的四百餘年，其後繼爲美國統治四十餘年，直至去年今日，始得解放，恢復爲東亞之菲島，故實爲値得紀念之一日。「菲島人之菲島」之口號，於攻陷科列基多島之日，即巳確立堅定不移之基礎，時經一年，新菲島各項之建設均突飛猛進，菲島已定此日爲一治安日」，菲島人民對菲島之治安均巳視爲己身之責任，無不努力從事恢復與維持，此種事實亦爲値得慶賀者。去歲初東條首相即於帝國議會中宣稱：將擁護菲島將來之獨立，本年一月下旬，重又確認此事，再者，此次東條首相於軍政事務叢脞中，仍躬臨視察新菲島之建設狀况，此使菲島各住民均衷心深感日本道義之精神，而努力向建設新菲島之途邁進。當此科列基多島攻陷一週年紀念之際，鄙人謹述所懷，願吾菲島一千八百萬住民努力奮興。</p>
<p>馬尼刺舉行慶祝典禮日軍長官出席致訓詞</p>
<p>馬尼刺七日中央社電常此日本東條首相蒞菲訪問之時，七日又逢美國侵略東亞據點科列基多島陷落周年紀念，故全菲上下無不益深感奮。菲島行政府並於七日下午五時在此間舉行「治安日」典禮，日菲島方面陸海軍軍政監部等首腦部與菲島行政府伐爾加斯長官各勒爾內務部長官等，均出席指導，參加民衆達十餘萬人，情緖至爲興奮熱烈。</p>
<p>馬尼刺七日中央社電　日菲島方面軍田中最高指揮官於七日菲島「治安日」致訓，大意謂，菲島美軍最後據點科列基多之陷落，迄今一年，今菲島已完全脫離過去美國之桎梏，展開建設新菲島，歷史上實最堪紀念者，亦爲菲島一千八百萬民衆最感滿足與慶幸者，余於此謹表慶賀之意。大東亞戰爭爲解放東亞建設亞洲人之亞洲而戰，開戰未及年半，英美侵略東亞之據點即巳全面覆減，英美勢力之敗退，東亞新時代即將實現，一年前之今日，科列基多陷落，菲島美國勞力至此遂完全廓淸，菲島亦即成爲東洋之新島，新菲島人民理解日本眞意，於日本指導下努力建設，實深欣愉，而規定本日之爲「治安日」，允足表示菲島官民一致協力之熱意。此次日本東條首相蒞菲視察新菲島之建設狀况，目覩諸君之努力及對我國之協力，其過去聲明承認獨立之信念，亦已益形堅決，余深望諸君以其熱意，積極協力完成大東亞戰爭，俾全菲一千八百萬民衆之光榮獨立，亦能早日實現。</p>
<p>馬尼剌七日中央社電　日東倏首相於此次訪菲時，特贈款一宗及金鷄納霜一噸，以爲菲島一般救濟之用，並以補助費交菲島行政長官，轉贈各慈善團體及敎昌訓練所菲人日語學校與警察訓練所等。</p>
<p>珊瑚海戰績周年紀念日海軍省頒勳狀嘉獎</p>
<p>東京七日中央社電　大東亞戰爭爆發後，日海軍所向無敵，屢在各决海戰中覆滅英·美主力艦隊，尤其去年五月六日珊瑚海一役，日海軍所獲戰果，實足巳震撼全球。是役日海軍部隊曾殲滅英·美海軍聯合主力艦隊，其中包括航空母艦，主力艦，巡洋艦及驅逐艦等二十餘艘，且又粉碎其奪取新幾內亞，新不列顚及蘇羅門島等根據地之企圖。翌日（七日）日軍某根據地航空部隊，復以日軍猛攻之防空砲火炸沉美主力艦加利福尼亞型及甲級巡洋艦奧克斯都號各一艘，軍艦威斯巴德型一艘。同時日軍某機動部隊亦於七日排除敵戰鬥機之猛烈防禦戰，轉瞬之間擊沉美航空母艦勒克辛頓型一艘，並重創美新式主力艦及巡洋艦各一艘，又擊落敵機五十架。是役日軍所獲戰果，足可匹敵在夏威夷及馬來兩次海戰中所獲之戰果，此實巳充分發揮日海軍强力無敵之當此日海軍戰史上光榮之珊瑚海戰正屆周年之時，日海軍省特於七日下午三時發表，聯司令長官授與機動部隊及某根據地航空部隊動狀，以示嘉獎。</p>

<p>中央社京訊　關於渝共間關係，最近雖少聞露骨之摩擦，然其內在矛盾，依然如故。據悉葉劍英會於四月二十日偕同甘彪赴重慶，會晤蔣介石，就共軍屢决要求未獲結果之事，再度與蔣會談，其要求之內容聞爲：（一）改善共軍之給養，外來援蔣兵器中，就可能配給共軍。（二）重慶不妨害延安與蘇聯間之直接交通綫。（三）因所謂開發西北而對美借款時，其借款一部須撥充赤區建設費。（四）解除對共軍之精神的物質的封鎖。又據可靠消息，渝共軍間之摩擦事，最近仍有加無已，如駐綏遠省伊克昭盟札薩克旗之渝「保安隊」，因受共匪煽動，於三月二十五日發生叛亂，事態非常嚴重，渝方「省主席」兼「保安司令」傅作義之鎭壓手段，爲一面政治，一面武力，任命伊克昭盟警備副司令黃士桐（當地一旅長）爲「討伐叛軍總司令」，另一方面則敎唆西蒙「抗日支隊長」奇玉山，出面調停，爲政治的解決，此外徐州南方洪澤湖附近，渝軍與共軍之相尅事件，本年以來，巳發生多起。</p>

<p>東京七日中央社電　日東條陸軍大臣與杉山參謀總長，於六日設宴招待中華民國國民政府軍事考察團時，該團團長葉蓬上將等，即席致謝詞。茲錄大意如决：今天敝視察團團員全體，蒙兼陸軍大臣東條閣下，參謀總長杉山閣下，賜以盛大的招待，並懇切的致詞，同人實深感謝。敝視察團同人奉敝國元首之命，前來貴國觀光，不僅荷蒙貴國政府的禮遇與厚待，幷蒙大臣閣下總長閣下以深厚之感情，予圓滿之參觀，使同人等得到更新的認識，同人更不勝銘感。同人等平常對於貴國國力之厚及優點之多，皆早有相當的認識，經此次觀光之後，便得到更新的認識，得到更詳確的新認識。決戰態勢下的日本全國，巳經成作一座偉大的强力的大兵營，這個大兵營中，仟何人仟何事全在兵法部勒之下緊張的活動着，這個大兵營中一切的裝備同設備，全巳科學化。這個大兵營之中，在本身的生產建設節的運動上，沒有資源物資不足的現象，確能耐抵長期的消耗戰。這僩大兵營中的鬥士們，全具有一生懸命的精神，同大東亞戰爭必勝的信念。凡此種種，使我們敬佩，使我們興奮，中華民國得與此强有力之盟邦互相提携，共同協力，誠不勝榮幸。中華民國在元首在先生領導之下，斷然參戰，一經實行參戰，便不容瞻顧徘徊，所謂甘苦與共生死相依，乃是自然之理，更屬必然之事，自不待言。至於中華民國之軍人，尙有古代豪俠之傳統，此傳統唯何，即崇尙道義，偏重感情，而不計利害是也。所以中國軍人不計現代作戰所需條件爲何，不問將來勝敗誰屬，惟以道義與感情之所在及決心與作爲之所向。因爲中國軍人具有這種情操，所以縱令在不利之情况下，爲戰友而共同犧牲，亦在所不惜，而決無遺憾，何况爲大東亞民族解放而奮鬥的日本，不但具有必勝之信念，而實具有必勝之條件。這樣中國軍人與血盟之友，協力到底，作戰釗底，皆是絕無問題的事，亦即貴我兩國高級將領所共同引爲安慰之事。主人閣下於席間致詞，望敝國國軍再建，最使同人不勝感激，敝國謹當講求不負所期云云。</p>

<h3 id="c16">日陸軍航空本部長　安田中將發表談話 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　日新任陸軍航空總監兼陸軍航空本部長安田武雄中將，本日於　見記者團時，曾發表談話，大意如下：</p>
<p>美國最近屢作誇大宣傳，自稱將製造飛機數十萬架或練成數十萬兵士等，彼等之所以作此誇大宣傳，無非因彼等除宣傳而外，別無他法可施，但彼等所謂類似（天文學數字）之巨大數目，亦未可輕視。蓋據最近所接消息，美國本年度飛機生產額，一月份爲五千架，二月份五千五百架，三月份六千二百架，其產額似雖巳增加，總之美國專重於「量」，而從事消耗戰，但美國之未具有無限之力量，且依最近狀况而觀，其力量實巳達頂點。同時其「量」之大，亦不足以使吾人驚懼，以往敵軍雖每在量上佔優勢，然事實上戰局之主動地位，仍操於吾人之手，其原因實在於吾人具有自强必勝之精神，因此吾人爲保持此地位起見，今後更應努力研究，並時時確保此主動地位上所必需之數量。其次關於質的方面，，美國迄今始自稱已製造一千五百匹馬力之發動機，而引爲自滿誇示。吾人對此不僅絲毫不感驚奇，且認爲幼稚可笑，蓋在日本實早巳建造此種發動機，如本月初旬日機轟炸達爾文港時，巳能充分表示日機素質之優秀。尙有一重要問題，即飛機駕駛員，因飛機並非僅爲一種交通工具，必須以駕駛員之技術及其精神，始能決定飛機之威力，換言之，即所謂「人機一體」四字，其决陸上之整備亦極爲重要，簡言之即爲陸空須成一體，因此日本航空部隊實力所以强大之理由，亦在能充分發揮「人機一體」及「睦空一體」等八字。再就國民對航空之熱意而論，近來國民已能澈底認識航空事業，且極關心，同時熱意亦大見增加，即以最近參加航空部隊之人員大量增加而觀，實深可欣幸者。至此，余已決以自强必勝之信心而傾全力於增强航空戰力，並確　吾人能始終保持空戰之主動地位，更期國民亦充分協力，至於吾人之潰滅英美空軍，乃屬必然，關於我航空部隊轟炸美國本地之舉，於此余不欲多言，總之已有充分之計劃，余所言者與美國之揚言轟炸日本，使成廢墟等誇大宣傳，實完全不同。</p>

<p>里斯本七日中央社電　據突尼西亞前綫消息，美第二軍進至馬特爾後，現又向北，東及東南三方繼續進攻，然因軸心軍之奮勇反擊，其進攻似巳受阻·德·美兩軍坦克車隊，曾於馬特爾東方展開激戰，美軍喪失坦克車十一輛，該方面之軸心軍小作撤退後，正布置堅固之防禦陣地，傳美軍以比塞大湖與阿克爾湖中間之斐里維爾爲目標而北上進攻，已將阿克爾湖南岸之搪培爾阿克爾佔領，幷以畏距離砲轟擊距比塞六十五哩之某地方，然德軍方面對此消息巳完全否認　謂該方面之軸心軍正對强力之美軍出以猛烈攻擊，且俯衝轟炸機及其他機隊非常活躍，予反軸心軍以極大損害。又以梅捷茲厄爾巴布爲中心之梅奇厄爾達溪各地帶，因安德森軍開始猛攻，兩軍到處展開激戰，英軍遭遇軸心軍猛烈反攻及大批地雷，死亡極衆。</p>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　據海通社軍事特派員稱：突尼西亞西部戰綫之反軸心軍，星期三在中部及北部增加壓力，但至目前爲止，此項攻擊尙不能認爲係如復活節大戰一樣之大規模進攻。在地中海與阿克爾湖北岸間之地峽中，法叛軍星期三以的一聯隊之實力進攻，但被擊退，且蒙重創，此處地區作戰之反軸心軍，並有美軍在內，其主要目的或並不在乎攻擊比塞大，而在乎在北面掃蕩而下，打開斐里維爾至阿克爾湖及比塞大湖間之隘路。另一部分美軍自馬特爾之西南開始向斐里維爾前進，至星期三晚尙鮮進展。美坦克車一隊，在馬特爾之東探索前進，與德軍坦克車發生接觸，美祖克車損失一半以上，至星期三晚爲止，反軸心軍尙未向此處地區或傑貝爾克却勃達之軸心陣地發動任何攻擊，但反軸心軍自馬特爾向東南對德包爾巴所施之壓力則頗爲猛力，在該處前進之作戰部隊，包括美軍及英軍，其迫近德包爾巴有多少距離，現尙難言。在籌包爾巴之西南英第一軍之中路精銳都隊，在梅特傑爾達正作猛烈戰鬥，在古爾齊亞　區戰局並無變動。法軍部隊再度冀圖自彭杜法　與傑貝爾柴格　安之間空進，在南部戰綫星期三幾全無戰鬥。反軸心軍於復活節大戰後即開始將第八軍部隊調遣，至第一軍現時似尙未完成其調動。在反軸心之後方可見有軍隊自東南向西北大規模移動，據此即可預測安特森將軍不久或將再向德·義陣綫之中央再作大規模之攻擊。</p>
<p>里斯本六日中央社電　據德國新聞社本日所接消息，反軸心軍曾屢攻突尼西亞前綫中，北兩段，但皆被固守之德·義軍所擊退，其所用之二十四輛坦克車，巳有十三輛毀於馬特爾之東西。據義軍指揮部之公報，突尼西亞前綫西段，昨曾屢挫敵軍之猛烈攻勢，義戰鬥機與轟炸機一度突製敵軍鐵甲車隊，因出意外，故被轟燬者達數十輛多，英·美機七架在空戰中，被德戰鬥機擊落。昨晚德·義重轟炸機曾空　阿爾及爾沿海之港務設備。</p>

<p>庫比希夫七日中央社電　波蘭駐蘇大使羅相爾，因蘇聯政府己與波蘭亡命政府斷絕外交關係，乃決定離蘇，巳於六日自此　啟程前赴伊朗。</p>
<p>莫斯科七日中央社電　反軸心方面方圖拉攏蘇，波兩國之棄嫌修好，蘇代理外交委昌長維靜斯基今日忽宣稱：蘇政府巳命令駐庫比希夫之波大使高級官員從速澈退。按該大使館之領袖爲前波蘭軍事使節團伏里考夫斯基將軍，同時維氏初次宣稱：蘇，波間巳有一協定之存在，按照該協定，波政府允籌　軍隊六師，以備與德軍在東綫周旋，然波國首領對軍隊之遣送延不履行，蘇政府迫不獲巳，對此項波軍加以相當之限制，該協定係於一九四一年簽訂。今日維氏在與英，美新聞記者會議席上聲稱：此項波籍使館人員在間諜工作頗形活動，尤其是伏將軍在蘇聯國內對間諜技能一意培植，促其實現不遺餘力。據庫比希夫未證實消息，波籍官員巳離庫比希夫而往黑德蘭，在該會議中。維氏曾檢討蘇，波關係之前因後果，渠謂按照一九四一年簽訂之協定，蘇政府允波方於蘇土設駐軍隊，並給波政府以三萬萬羅布之借款不計利息，其目的在成立六師波軍（三萬人），並創辦一軍官訓練學校與東綫蘇軍駢肩作戰。迄一九四一年十月廿五日，該項波軍巳有軍官二六三〇名，士兵四一五六一名，詎波政府與波司令雖一再保證該項波軍立即加入前綫，然實行日期亦一再展緩，迨翌年七月一日波軍正式完備，而波總司令藉口一部份軍隊之參加對整個軍事行動殊屬不便，始終不將其軍隊開往東綫，於是蘇政府即視該項波軍爲非戰鬥部隊，而尅减其糧食，然波政府仍拒絕將其軍隊開赴蘇聯前綫。</p>

<p>美國中部的有力報紙的代表者支加哥講壇報主持者勞伯特·麥可密克，公然聲言英帝國的解體；屬領，甚至於英國本國，參加烏美國的一州，爲英美緊密化的捷　，兩紐帶强化之根本的解決辦法，極露骨地表示了意　　承英國遺產的野心。</p>
<p>如其英美的　　目的眞是打倒軸心，而在血戰方酣中，一個新聞社的中持者，公然提出併呑與國的議論，而說這是他的私見，在我們用常識看來，實在是想不到的。即使說傍若　人的言行是美國人的天性，但這種肆無忌憚的言論，到底不能不使人　之咋舌，其次我們冉看美國想制覇世界的現實政策時，他這種主張，決不能說這是他個人臆造的空中樓閣，麥可密克實可說就是羅斯福政權的代言人。</p>
<p>前次軍備租借法史新案交美國議會審議時，上院中如泰伊登·奈伊等領袖聯合聲稱我們供給反軸心方面的武器，並不是我們漂亮地做好事。讓渡驅遂艦的代價，光把英領西印度諸島永久置於美國屬下，還嫌不够，更須用現物淸算，質言之，英國須用她的領土來償還。副總統華萊斯，國務副卿威爾斯均肯定此說，於是英帝國的分割，打破了政界方面的揣測，而成爲美國的現實政策，麥可密克不過進一步把它具體化而已。更就北非情勢而言，英美互相明爭暗鬥，各自擁立傀儡政權以期確保其支配權，迄至最近，美國的眼中，特古爾沒有了，連季祿也沒有了，祗要北非戰况一旦轉變，羅期福立即任命現任紐約市長拉迦台亞爲北非總督，準備實力支配。英美在互爭世界覇權之前，表面上雖爲與國，暗裏包藏着敵對關係的矛盾。時常因短兵相接的摩擦而發出火花。</p>
<p>成爲英帝國解體論之對象的英國自治領加拿大，實質上業已變成美國的一州，因此次戰爭而完全成爲美國兵工廠的分廠。澳洲，新西蘭也脫離英本國而歸美國的軍事支配，其歸趨亦不言可喻麥考密克的私見似乎還沒有說到印度，但美國的軍事，經濟力日　滲透於印度，想乘英本國的疲憊，取而代之，這在他們現在的印度政策上，不是極爲顯著嗎？懷着制覇世界的野心的羅斯福，無論其是否穩秘蠶食英國本土的惡意，由於今後的行動，終難逃出世界的耳目，英國除了南非外，全部屬領的即將喪失，業巳顯然可見。不問其是否併入美國，但英國巳向美國永久的屈膝了。</p>
<p>英國到那裏去？這次戰爭倘若失敗，英國不復存在，即使不敗，英國也必將陷於如目前美加關係的同樣狀態。邱吉爾曾作豪語聲稱「吾不是大英帝國的淸算人」，但在老大的英帝之解體過程中，無所逃於天羅　網之悲劇的扮演者，不能不就是邱吉爾其人。（翔：譯自四月三十日東京讀賣報知社論）</p>
<h3 id="c22">美國煤礦工潮的透視 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>美國本雪文尼亞州的煤礦工人四十五萬，因提出一日增加工資二圓的要求被拒絕，宜言罷工，不管羅斯福大總統的調停乃至威嚇，竟表示着有以五月一日早晨爲期而開始實行的氣勢。美國政府對此似將發動大總統的戰時權力，採取武力的彈壓方針。像從來的幾次罷工案一樣，政府的彈壓政策，也許可以成功。然而那却並不是說，因爲政府的彈壓成功，罷工停止，根本問題就得解决。</p>
<p>抑且美國的勞動爭識，在大東亞戰爭爆發之後，戰爭輿情達到最高潮的當時，急激减少，然而其後又復呈現漸增的形勢。像這次的煤礦罷工，雖然由於煤礦業是扼美國全國實業的生死攸關之重要實業，罷工人員的衆多，以及其工會爲美國最有力的勞動組織，而被特別注目，其實也無非是此等正在逐漸增加的勞動爭議之一例而已。所以縱然這次的罷工可得早期解決，而美國實業界和勞動界的普遍的不安，及其內面的矛盾，却不能就此消除。</p>
<p>美國的全戰時經濟機構，如所周知，正由於可怕的通貨膨脹的威脅而被震撼着，勞動爭議的大部分，也就是通貨膨脹所引起的生活不安爲其根本原因。不消說，美國政府的對策，在於澈底防止惡性的通貨膨脹，因此正傾注其全力於嚴重的物價抑制和工資固定。然而其結果，乃呈現着只有物價昂騰，而工資則不能隨之而漲的現象。是故，其施於勞動爭議的彈壓政策，對於勞工生活的不安和困苦，一定更使激化。</p>
<p>這次的大東亞戰爭，起因於羅斯福的戰爭掗賣政策，爲現在一般美國國民所熟知。開戰以後，舉美國國民全體以支持戰爭者，是以最小的犧牲爲條件。美國人現在正怯於他們自身的生活不安，還能到處謳歌這無理的戰爭嗎？誇着豐富的資源和生產力的美國，原來是有着這樣的思想弱點和舌悶的。不過我們倒不是故意把敵人弱點在這裏作過大視之的。又此次的罷工事件，不但阻害生產，增大社會的不安，更不能不認爲於美國國民的思想動搖，有很大的刺戟。（丁：譯自五月二日朝日新聞社論）</p>
<h3 id="c23">美國工潮並未眞正解決 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>曾被預料一時將見最惡化的美國煤礦工人的罷工，據說業巳決定於四日早晨一律復工了。制美國全國實業的生死之煤礦業，不消說，決不至於在戰時下，因着勞動爭議之故，而永遠停閉，解決的條件，究竟如何談妥，現在雖尙不明，然而不管其條件如何，其解決之決不是眞正的解決，不待於言。</p>
<p>此次罷工所明白暴露的，第一就是物價和工資的跛行狀態。隨着戰爭的深刻化，軍需生產的擴張和民需物資生產的縮小，成爲反比例而背馳，乃是勢所必然。這情勢的發展，一定會使那物價和工資的跛行傾向，益趨激化，成爲對於一切勞工生活之可怕的威脅。一時性的工資協定，因此乃被陸續要求改訂，由此而引起勞資爭議，波及於全生產領域，農業生產也受其波及。因着物價騰貴而提高工資，因着工資提高而物價騰貴，這樣的反復，恐怕沒有停止之日，一般的經濟混亂，由是而起。</p>
<p>此次罷工所暴露的第二椿事情，就是勞工方面對於美國政府——特別是對於戰時勞工局的不信。此次罷工，工會方面的主張，以勞資直接交涉，拒絕勞工局的調停爲骨幹。這不是對於美國政府的權威之一大侮蔑嗎？據說美國人一向是爲了要擁護自己的利益而蔑視一切的法律和權威的，此次爭議，正把這樣的性格明白地表示出來了。像這樣爲勞工大眾的態度所搖撼着的長期戰的遂行，具有怎麼樣的不安，當不難想像而得。</p>
<p>不管這次的罷工已經速告解決，而其爲暴露美國最大弱點之一者，則是不容懷疑的事實。不消說，我們必須愼防把敵人的弱點作過大的評價，然而看了敵陣的這　混亂，我們對於國內的整備，反而可以一新更圖精進的決意。（丁：譯自五月四日朝日新聞社論）</p>

<p>日大使館發言人廣田，昨在招待外籍新聞記者席上宣稱：重慶與澳洲兩方，企圖誘致英美變更其在一月份卡薩布蘭卡會議　議決「先解決歐洲」政策，已遭完全失敗。廣田並發　吿謂：日本當然將利用西南太平洋之現行局勢，而予反軸心國以嚴重打擊。蓋現行環境，對日本極屬有利，日本當然不甘寂然不動，而任令黃金時機之消逝。按澳洲與重慶在二三月間，即覺察卡薩布蘭卡會議決案之不利於已，繼即籲請英美變更上項政策，然其呼籲結果，幾等於零。英美請該政策未　更改，惟保證將在該政策範圍內，考慮種種可能給渝澳兩方之恊助，然則渝澳之失望與失敗，已不言而喻。廣田續謂：澳洲已遺其外長愛凡博士，專程赴美，作正義之呼籲。其他主張更變反軸心計劃者，爲首相寇丁，麥克沃塞將軍，勃拉美爵士，坎納等，重慶方面則已委派宋美齡，宋子文，胡適博士等同時赴美，雖有史蒂威爾及奇諾爾兩將軍之聲助，其使命成功之希望，尚屬遙遠，廣田謂該兩將軍早已返囘，則其一無所成，殆無疑義。至此廣田引前駐蘇大使楊杰，在渝報紙所發論文一篇，詳述澳洲景况，已因反軸心國在太平洋實施現行政策而愈形悽慘。並謂所謂「先解決歐洲」之計劃，殊使澳洲防衛危殆莫往，日本勢必利用此項弱點，而加以突擊，渠發進一步警吿謂：澳洲處處易受日方之攻擊，反軸心國增强正太平洋之軍力，方足應付。易言之，反軸心國已自承其在太平洋之戰略弱點。廣田末謂：日本當然不甘任令此項局勢長此下去，觀於五月初以來所建之軍事功勳其在南太平洋方面，已能儘量利用局勢矣云。</p>

<p>— 吳承康</p>
<p>近百年來，我國行政權已被「租界」「治外法權」等等不平等條約破壞得支離破碎，居住租界內數百萬人民，一直在外人熱力下過其重重壓迫的奴隸生活，在外人心目中，就始終不把我們當作人看待過，試從公園中「狗與華人不准入內」的廣吿牌上看去，就充分暴露這句話的真實性。歷年租界內警衛，偵緝和監獄人員虐殺我無辜良民的慘案，真是數見不鮮，最近張金海慘案的發生，不過說明這　勢還續在演進中罷了。</p>
<p>張案發生後已由其家屬以及各界正義人士組織公團進行法律救濟，當有合理處置，但因此案的發生，深深感到如何整飭租界內的警衛·偵緝和監獄人員，在租界將見交還的今日，實屬是件刻不容緩的急務，茲請略責芻見如下：</p>
<p>（一）剷除媚外凌已的奴隸心理，租界內虐待市民案件的演成，主角固然是外人，要是沒有華人爲其爪牙，亦是孤掌難鳴，長受外人薰陶的華人幹部，日久被其麻醉，不惜爲虎作倀，甘被利用，我們對這批被麻醉的同胞，絕情不願賤視他們，反之應該憫　他們，同情他們，如何想法敎化他們，使他們從魔窟中自拔出來，在建設新中國的陣營中，我們還少不了這批熟悉市情的生力軍。問題的解決，應該先找出癥結的所在，對症下藥，然後痼疾得治，現在，巨　已除，曙光在臨的時候，我們萬不可忽視此潛在於租界各階層的　政人員——這一批拜受英美殖民遺毒的昔日曾爲外人殘害我們的爪牙，應該去惡務盡，快把潛伏於他們心裏的奴隸心理，同時剷除，否則野草除不盡，春風吹又生，難免重貽後惠！</p>
<p>（二）養成親民的愛眾的服務精神：在民生國家裏，貴爲大總統的不過是人民的一員公樸，要知公務員之所以獲有治人的權力，完全是廣大民眾　與的，所以公務員行使職權，該　　以多數民眾的幸福爲前提，職權明明有範圍，逾此即爲濫用，濫用職權刑法上規定是犯罪的行爲，雖達官顯宦，亦雖例外，原國家因敎化不周所以輔以刑律，實際上是件不得已的事情，刑律的用意還在促使悔過和希冀自新，這裏實有「慈母爲愛子而責子」的深長寓義，所以警政人員於執行職務里應如何减免犯罪者一切不必要的身心上痛苦才對。</p>
<p>租界警政人員的急待整飭，已如上述，我們希望有關當局預籌對策，毋使接收後的租界中人民，再受百年來疾首蹙額的苛政，與其「焦頭爛額，何如曲突徙薪」，願我賢明的當局三復斯言。</p>

<p>法租界誠記衫襪厰學徒張金海斃命一案，本市市府已將全案經過調查屬實後，昨對法總領提出抗議，略謂，「查本案業經上海第二特區地方法院騐明張金海委　生前受傷身死有案，該西捕等辦理本案，不依法律手續，濫用非刑，致人於死，實屬草菅人命，不法已極，相　提出嚴重抗議，即希查照，轉飭公董局，對於凟職行兇之西捕等，依法秉公嚴予　處，並對於死者家屬，要求保留賠償撫卹之權，暨保證嗣後不得再有同樣事件發生，以重民命，仍盼見復爲荷。此致法國駐滬總領事馬　禮。」</p>
<p>二特地院呈報經過</p>
<p>第二特區地方法院，對於張金海慘遭法捕房非刑逼供致死一案，備極　視，已將經過事實，備呈司法行政部，其原文云：「案查本年四月三十日法租界警務處報騐張金海因病身死」案，據稱：「死者年十九歲，鎭江人，在本市菜市路二九二號辣斐　記襪衫厰當職員，本年四月廿九日下午三時，因該厰學徒彭　龍被吿侵占遺失物一案，株連被捕，不料三十日上午六時，張金海忽然患病，延醫不治身死，請即派員蒞騐。」當時以該張金海旣係因案被捕應訊，忽爾病斃，頗滋疑竇，經派員前去檢騐，發見屍體外表壯實，目太陽穴及左肋部份呈現傷痕多處，顯非因病身死，乃諭留待翌日解剖檢騐，次晨，果據屍屬張和生等具狀略稱：「張金海彭雙龍被捕房西探非法刑訊，一死一傷，請求澈究，」等情前來，是日午後三時，由首席檢察官親自督同檢察官法醫書記官等馳往台拉司脫路騐屍所時，有法警醫師桑得利及其助手華籍醫師趙開澍在塲，共同將張金海屍体解剖檢騐，騐得頭部肋部皮下溢血，脾臟破裂，委係重傷致死，（請參考法醫檢定書）當訊據承辦是案之法籍探目米雷，雖不承認濫施刑訊事件，查張金海逮逋之時，身體健全無病，已爲該探當塲自認，乃於逮逋訊問之後，未及一日，遽爾身死，證明檢騐情形受傷屬實，况據彭雙龍陳述被捕後，張金海如何被打，如何灌水，指供歷歷，決非虛構，　自己身上傷害雖經多日醫治，仍未退盡，（請參考傷單及五朋四日筆錄）則該西探承訊該案，苟非嚴刑威　，何致一傷一死，其草菅人命，乖違人道，實屬罪無可逭，除已向法租界行政當局司法顧問口頭提出嚴重抗議，俟交涉有圓滿　果，再行呈報外，理合先將本案檢騐情形，呈報鍳核。0又地院除已向法租界行政當局提出口頭抗議外，復　送書　抗議　法租界行政當局司法顧問夏伯。</p>
<p>華法當局會晤折衝</p>
<p>中央社訊，司法行政部長　君　氏抵　後，對於張案慘斃經過，業經聽取各方報吿，現正靜　該案之發展中，司法行政駐滬辦事處副處長顧碩，偕同費秘書及司法部參事彭望軾，會同特二法院首席檢察官沈文傑，於昨日中午十二時正，啣命至法警務處，會晤警務監法勃爾，基於司法立塲，開始作法律上之折衝，據理力爭，至一時許始行散會，聞法租界警務總監法勃爾之表示，調該案極願秉公辦理，惟市民旣起公憤，如有意外事件之發生，　警務處爲維持界內治安起見，依然有權採取各項必要之措置，但我方則予以嚴厲駁覆，答明此事與秉公處理無關，意外事態之發生與否，將以是否秉公爲依斷，想中法邦交素睦，法方決不致有所偏袒也。</p>
<p>屍體檢騐節外生枝</p>
<p>查慘遭重斃命之張金海屍體，業經中法司法當局檢定在案，確係傷重斃命，絕無疑議，不　在　剖檢騐時，法籍醫師桑得利，以張之脾臟較常人　大，隨時有破裂出血致命爲由，發生爭執，當時將張　脾臟分剖爲二，各執其一，法方已送至震旦學院予以化騐，但我方法醫　此，能則認爲並無異狀。</p>
<p>馮處長感想</p>
<p>宣傳部駐滬辦事處處長馮節氏云，本案發生之後，對此慘無人道之不幸事件，不勝慨嘆，良以此類事件，在百年來英美侵略勢力下之上海，實屬司空見慣，但自前年十二月八日以後，上海情勢已日趨明朗，法巡捕房仍有　違反時代意義之行爲，無怪一般人士深致　慨，吾人應知中國與友邦日本協力東亞民族解放，實從百年積壓之下求天賦獨立自由之恢復，並非驕矜誇妄，更非排外，不論歐亞友邦，自當寄予同情，本人深望法租界當局認識此意義，對此欺侮賤視中國民命之非法兇捕，予以嚴懲，爲最賢明之措置，尤望我社會人士，一秉光明態度，以文明手段，合法進行，求得本案之圓滿解決。</p>
<p>新聞界聲援</p>
<p>關於張金海被法捕房非弄拷打致遭慘死一案，昨由死者之父張元吉具呈本市上海新聞聯合會，略謂：「其子金海，慘遭毒刑致死，法捕房如此草菅人命，橫行不法，若不治以應得之罪，則寃　永沉海底，請予以有力之聲援，庶沉寃得雪，兇手伏法」云云。新聞聯合會據呈後，　於第七次理事會議決定函覆張元吉，並囑會員各報對此慘案，力予聲援，務達懲兇賠償，並保證以後不再有類此情事發生之目的。</p>

<p>查我國之　生產　業者，莫不注重於農林工礦的　展。農業爲主要糧食所自出，植林　建築材料所必需，工業爲一切生產的　脈，礦業乃開發天賦的泉源，其重要自不言而喻。但在今日高唱增加各項生產之中，水產部門亦當予以注意。因水產不特可　補助　糧，且可爲農出的肥料及醫　工業上的用品。日本漁業的發達，爲東亞冠，全國有一百餘萬人民業漁爲生，他們在國　的生產綫上，佔着很重要的位置。</p>
<p>我國海岸延袤一萬五千餘里，加　河流之廣，湖泊之多，各種水產的　　，不亞其他各國。漁民人數，　無　計，然亦決不在少，可是漁民生活的苦况，反映着我國漁業的幼稚。所以一向魚　的進口，年居大宗。所以，漁業　積極提倡，　亦不容稍緩，諸如魚種的培養，捕法的改良，裝貯的研究，皆在其內，即金融業對於漁業資金的週轉，亦當視爲與農業金融，同樣重要。果能於　加生產的呼聲中，開發我們水中的富源，不是可心解決我國一部分的食糧問題，並且可以推進又一個主要生產部門。</p>

<p>農村貸款銀團，各方均盼早日成立，交通銀行，對此異常注意，自去年起，即組織農村調查團，派赴蘇浙皖三省各農村，分頭實地調查，業已吿一段落，刻正研究農業貸款之方式，又聞該行之調查內容及結果如次：</p>
<p>調查重心</p>
<p>大約有左列六項：（一）農村交通之實際情形，尤以農村之通行道路及河道往來狀况爲主，現金往來與移動物資情形。（二）各地金融情形。（三）各主要鄉村之農業倉庫狀况。（四）農民之生活狀况。（五）各地農產品之不足狀况。（六）土質及各地特殊情形。交通銀行方　　根據上次調查結果，擬訂　適當之辦法，一般金融界均盼該行今後積極從　。</p>
<p>現在缺點</p>
<p>據該團之調查報吿稱：現在之農村放款有左列各項缺點：（一）放款利息不　一，例如江蘇省某縣，同樣之　款，利息高低有數倍之差。（二）放款數額，有則過多，有則過少，毫無一定標準。（三）各銀行彼此不能合作，互相排擠。（四）各銀行大多不在地方設立支行，其任務即該管地方行政機關代行，心致　端百出。（五）借款被地產業主獨占，耕作農民仍祇能厚利借款，（六）合作社不脫配給物資之合作社性質。信用合作社，尚未　達。</p>
<p>研究辦法</p>
<p>參酌上列各　實際情形，刻正研究下列放款辦法：（一）成立共同貸款銀團爲當務之急。（二）設置合作金庫，此　金庫以貸款爲主要目的，如無此種組織，則對於有利增加農產之佃農放款，將不可能。（三）目前增加農產之最大問題，爲治水問題，故放款更有其必要。　（雲鵬：譯自五月七日大陸新報）</p>

<h3 id="c48">理智與情感 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— 步仁</p>
<p>我以爲：　感在吾人身上好如一部無形的發動機，而理智就是駕駛員；這二者對人生都非常重要，不能缺一。僅有强力的發動機而不加以好好的駕駛，每致出軌闖禍。反之，祗有技能精練的駕駛員而沒有良好的發動機，也屬徒然，旣不能趨達目的地，亦不會有什麼成就</p>
<p>所以有了豐富的情感，才能驅使我們奮發行進，勇於任事，甚至做一番損己而利天下的偉業。試看古今中外，多少史冊留名的人物，那一個不是情感豐富的人？但豐富的情感，自然必須充足完善的理智來加以控制。</p>
<p>每個人有理智，也每個人有情感。但不幸的是：有的强於理智而薄於情感，有的富於情感而拙於理智；於是，偏重理智者斥某些熱情的人爲「意氣用事」，富於情感的譏某些偏重理智者爲「麻木不仁」。其實·理智與情感在人生途上的重量，應是牛斤對八兩。過於偏重理智，不要說這社會將因此而成爲如何的寂寞冰冷？人生將因此而變成怎樣的單調乏味？就是對你個人，也將使你畏首畏尾，觳觫不前，遷就現實，一無作爲。但僅有熱情而缺乏理智，也正猶如自人騎着瞎馬一般，會帶你到危險的境地，往往會給你留下日後許多的遺憾與悔恨</p>
<p>我們理想中的「完人』，該是：旣要備有良好强力的發動機——正當豐富的情感；也要具有精明榦練的駕駛力…充分完善的理智。道樣，才能妥切地驅使我們向「美」「善」之域行進！失敗一而的。</p>
<p>金錢損失了，光陰蹉跎了，事業失敗了，爲的什麼？迷醉在「博」中，僥倖的希望上！</p>
<h3 id="c49">打窮算盤 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— 龔常</p>
<p>在生活維難之今日，供給子女　書，眞不是一件容易的事。就拿我自己來說吧，不過兩個孩子在上小學，每學期的費用差不多要四百元，計學費二百三十元，書籍紙本一百十元，筆墨用具三十三元，其他雜費十元。這個數目由闊老者來，算不了一回事，而在我輩掙扎於飢餓綫上的薪工階級，平日非寅吃卯糧，即毫無剩餘，要籌措這一筆錢，可就煞費苦心了！我以家長一份子的地位，曾仔細思索　减輕負担之道。學費因維持學校開支及敎師生活，除獲有公私津貼外，無减少希望。於是窮算盤打到書籍紙本上來。</p>
<p>一利用舊書上常見有些小學生的書用後隨便亂擲，實在可惜。從前　分錢一冊的書，現在賣到一二元，有時還欲買不得。我以爲家長敎師應該盡力幫助孩子們寳愛書籍。每學期終，擇　甚破爛者，折價收回，留備下班使用。如此一册書可以給幾班學生讀，至不堪再用爲止。書籍本身盡了最大的效用，家長書籍費用之撥負，亦可稍輕。</p>
<p>二節省紙本消耗：孩子們不知物力艱難，糟踏紙張，實堪驚人。一張紙上寫幾行即不冉用，數見不鮮。我們要敎他儘量節省的方法。沒有空行空格，甚至鉛　寫過再加墨筆，正面寫過寫反面。紙張本身盡着最大的效用，家長紙本費用之擔負　亦可　輕。</p>
<p>窮人窮算盤，也許有人這樣譏　我。但須知惜一分物力，即增國家一分元氣，並不是小問題。</p>
<h3 id="c50">讀書今昔觀 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— 任川</p>
<p>「讀書」在封建時代，木來是帝王士大夫階級的專有物。被認做低賤的農工子弟是沒有去受同等的敎育的資格的。這種自私的心理，無非階級社會的產物。「學而優則仕」也不過謀維持他們高踞在人頭頂上的寳座。及到科舉取士，則不過是帝王們的愚民政策，欲藉富貴榮華收買人心，籠絡天下人才入我彀中，拆穿了說，也不過是要想保持萬世之基不隳。</p>
<p>傳統的觀念，「讀書」是被認爲獵取功名的唯一終南捷徑：「十年窗下無人之知，一舉成名天下聞，」那時還不够揚眉吐氣嗎？况且「書中自有顏如玉，書中自有黃金屋，書中自有千鍾粟」這幾句滿帶着誇張誘惑色彩的口號——美人，金錢，生活，串在一根功名的爛草繩上還不够束縛讀書人一顆心嗎？</p>
<p>所以過去的讀書人自視甚高，看不起農工，自己呢，常然，不辨菽麥，認爲理所當然。</p>
<p>然而現在階級雖不能澈底的拆除，特定的圍牆是已經傾圯了，讀書已經規定爲每個公民歷盡的義務，國家有强迫的　務敎育實使。觀念，也從狹隘的功名裏解放出來，從小我的個人享樂擴大到羣體的幸福。讀書，是去接受前人寳貴的遺產——知識，　騐，運用它跟現實參證，配合，改良，創造。不　閉着　想，也得睜着眼看，更得胼手胝足地去行。從架空到實際，從死知識到活運用，這一切是今昔讀書的不同處吧！</p>
<h3 id="c51">賭博 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— 莎蕾</p>
<p>「僥倖所得來的，必從僥倖中失去！」這是句不移的名言。</p>
<p>「賭博」是僥倖的一時勝利，而必定是永久的失敗。</p>
<p>希望根植在僥倖上，等於斷綫紙鷂，一飛冲天，飄搖，驕傲，興奮，在妄，緊接在後面的是：翻筋斗從雲層裏直穿下來，驚惶，失措，懊惱，氣挫，頹然的跌倒在地面，骨折顱碎。而「賭陣」是完全跟牠沒有兩樣。</p>
<p>偏執着「賭博」也有勝利的成功，以爲這跟一般常例不會參差——失敗是成功之母，在每一次局面中，幻了一個希望，將注押推上去。然而希望嘲弄着他，失望鞭撻着他。因爲這希望是架空的。假使你走一段路，或做一件工作，祇要努力不輟，精神所至，自然金石爲開。而「賭博」是追求羞海市蜃樓，在鬆軟的沙灘上想建造起成功的塔來。</p>
<p>許多其他事情，千百次的失敗，祗須一次的成功，就奠定了勝利的礎石！「賭博」呢？九十九次的勝利，一次的失敗，不難捐棄全功，而况那比例永遠是百分之九十九側重在</p>
<h3 id="c52">野心 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— 耶魯</p>
<p>曾經有過不少前輩先生指示我們靑年修養的道理與成功的要義，歸納言之，就是要靑年有學問，還要有野心，那末才有發展的希望。</p>
<p>所謂野心，就是以全副精神智慧配合最大的勇氣，努力以求理想的實現。因此，野心不妨「人皆有之」，但是由於目的不同，野心的結果，可以爲善，也可以造惡。惡的局面中最顯著的使是少數人的「囤積」野心是成功了；可是却苦了不計其數的同類。所以像囤積之類，不是野心，而是黑心。人一黑了心，便可違背良心，無惡不作了！</p>
<p>至於善的局面，像改善民生間題等等，還有待於野心者的開闢創造。因此我絕對贊成一個人的野心是遠大，不過手段必須光明，目的必須純正。因爲「公道自在人心」，從正道而成的野心，才値得大家的擁戴和敬仰。</p>
<p>所以凡是受過相當敎育的靑年，應該抱定「讀書明理」的精神，不可有自私自利的野心，而要有福國利民的野心，否則太辜負了前輩先生的善意。</p>
<h3 id="c53">漫話「希望」 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— 邵達</p>
<p>望的範圍極廣，任何人都不能離牠獨處，因爲每個人生命的因素，都需要得着牠才能維持。</p>
<p>當一個人自覺得他前途再也沒有希望的時候，他的意志已先頽唐了。這種人最危險，也最可憐。因爲意志一頽唐，就不免生出許多潦倒自殺等的慘果來。所以尤其是一般被處在最困苦環境裏的人們，更不能須臾的離開希望：至於他們所以不肯貿然輕身的緣故，正因爲有希望的自信力在做着他們的後盾，所以他們才會有更大的勇氣來繼續的生存下去，同時在這種的勇氣裏，還包含着大量興趣的成分，人一有了這種爲希望而生存的樂趣時，就可以憑着牠來向惡努的環境搏鬥；從痛苦中掙扎到理想的路上來。所以希望不僅是每個人的生命泉源，並且更是一般失意人的救命劑。</p>
<p>那麼「希望」兩字作何解解釋呢？什麼又叫做「希望」呢？「希望」是內心對外界或前途的一種理想，「望」是冀願這理想能趨爲「事實」。嚴格的說起來，「希望」兩宇僅不過是一個空虛的袖象名詞。人當然不應該有自己認爲沒有希望的心理，可是也得要明白希望是從理想而來的，而理想又是對環境不滿足而起的，要改良環境的不足，就得脚踏實地的去實踐他的理想。幹到理想成爲事實的一天，也就是免理空虛希望的一天。假如光理想而不能照理想去實行時，這理想却是個空幻的夢想，不過這夢想跟一個叫化子想去和一個貴婦人結婚的夢想不同，前者是可以實行而不去實行的辜負夢想，後者却是個根本不可能的奢欲夢想，不過社會上又偏多這種人，他們很明白這是一種不値得夢　而又夢想不得的夢想，可是這夢想也能使他們息了「歇斯的里」的心，能暫時的得到安慰，也有不少人甘願把自己的終身麻醉在這種的心理中，因爲這樣可以减少他們不少的痛苦，因之終日終年的在思劃着他的夢想，在夢想的心目中，映着他五色繽紛的畫片；合理的環境，可是有時候的事實，的確也會是這樣</p>
<p>人難各有其希望，可是這希望的出發點却是殊人人殊，老年人希望有一口良好的棺木和一方幽靜的墓地，幼年人希望父母們能多給他一些好吃的糖果和好玩的玩具，做官的希望官運亨通，文士們希望能够文得所在，學生們希望獨佔鰲頭，生意人希望利高三倍，窮小子希望平步靑雲，色情的人希望得到一個花妙的情人，甚至發財在的人希望大香賓彩得第一……」</p>
<p>總之，希望是無窮盡的，有純正的良好希望，有重心不足的奢望，有普遍的食衣欲望，更有夢想多端的幻望……。」</p>
<p>人類的希望旣是這樣的不一，社會間的角逐也就越顯得千變萬化，結果唯有智慧者的正規希望，才能邁越在所有希望的前端，因爲這希望是最有生氣的，進化的，也是理想上最可能兌現的一種希望。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Zhang Case is a Serious Social Problem <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the case of French police detectives abusing their power and causing the wrongful death of Zhang Jinhai, we pointed out in yesterday's editorial that the core of this case is a legal issue. The perpetrators should be punished according to the law to seek a reasonable resolution. It is absolutely not a diplomatic issue that involves the friendship between China and France. Currently, Zhang Jinhai's family has filed a lawsuit with the relevant court. At the same time, the French Consul General's office, at the request of the Police Commissioner, has ordered the head of the consular court to conduct a detailed investigation and has suspended all personnel who can provide testimony. We hope that all parties involved will focus on the legal liabilities, not let the perpetrators escape the law, and use it as a warning to future offenders. Furthermore, the French police authorities must recognize and uphold the dignity of the law, and frankly hand over the offending officers to the court, so that the resolution of this case is entirely within the legal realm and does not lead to other unexpected and negative consequences.</p>
<p>At the same time, we believe that the Zhang case is a serious social problem, not a political one. Examining the details of the Zhang case, the French police, based on the plaintiff's accusations, suspected Zhang Jinhai of committing a crime. When he did not confess during interrogation, they resorted to torture. When torture did not work, they resorted to cruel torture, leading to his death. The purpose of using torture is originally to prevent those who are cunning and deny their guilt, coercing them to admit the truth to determine the truth of the case. Such use of torture has its limits. However, if there is no real crime and torture is used to try to force a false confession, and even more, cruel torture is used because of the refusal to falsely confess, such use of torture is undoubtedly illegal. We are even more willing to frankly point out that such illegal cruel torture, based on the course of the Zhang case, does not seem to be an isolated incident.</p>
<p>May we ask why police detectives use illegal cruel torture on citizens? Our answer involves the issue of "corruption." To put it bluntly, they use torture as a means to achieve fraudulent purposes. Therefore, this kind of torture has become a matter of bribery and fraud. Due to this improper purpose of using torture, many acts of mutual deception, seeking revenge, and even so-called "装笋头 [being framed]" incidents have occurred, forming a dark side of society. At most, the Zhang case involves falsely claiming a coat. Moreover, whether this is true or not is still under investigation. Then, what is the purpose of using severe torture? It is not difficult to imagine. Although we cannot make rash judgments before a legal verdict, there is no doubt that the use of torture has exceeded its limits. Therefore, we say that the Zhang case itself is a serious social problem, not a political one, for this very reason.</p>
<p>We have already explained that the purpose of this kind of illegal torture is to force false confessions and engage in fraud. This is a serious social problem. Then, in order to completely eliminate this social poison and protect the human rights and legal rights of citizens, we urge the agencies and authorities responsible for maintaining public order to pay close attention to the motives of those who use torture, abolish severe torture, and improve the methods of torture. In addition to this, special emphasis should be placed on the character and integrity of the personnel performing the torture. In particular, we hope that the French police authorities will take the Zhang case as a turning point and truly reform the work style of the criminal division.</p>
<p>Police officers are police, and detectives are a type of police officer, all of whom are responsible for protecting citizens and safeguarding public order. Their relationship with citizens is extremely close. They themselves should understand that cooperating with citizens harmoniously and getting along well are all within their responsibilities. Even if citizens do not understand the police regulations, they should be explained and guided kindly, to prevent mistakes and repeat offenses. The high-handed, arrogant attitude is not appropriate. The police authorities should make the attitude of the police towards citizens the main training subject. At the same time, rigorous assessment should be conducted, and it should be listed as the main item in service rewards and punishments. We believe that only through sincere cooperation between citizens and the police can satisfactory social order be established.</p>
<p>Police training in Japan and Germany is renowned throughout the world. The amiable and polite attitude of police officers towards citizens that we have seen in Japanese metropolises is unimaginable for Shanghai citizens. Therefore, the current state of opposition and animosity between some police officers and citizens makes us even more envious of the effective training of the Japanese police. Recently, the Public Concession Police has been headed by experienced police officers from friendly Japan, and we urgently hope that they will establish a model police administration as soon as possible.</p>
<p>We are waiting for the legal conclusion to the resolution of the Zhang case. The Zhang case, as well as the thousands of unexposed Zhang cases, is a serious social problem, and we must achieve effective improvement. The French police should immediately conduct self-examination, strictly discipline their subordinates, and rectify the laws to ensure that the Zhang case never happens again in the future. At the same time, we hope that the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau and the Public Concession Police will take the Zhang case as a lesson and first conduct self-examination of their subordinates to prevent problems before they arise. If citizens see a new image of police officers, they will naturally be happy to cooperate. Then, the police and the people will be united, and public order will surely achieve good results. Furthermore, the elimination of social ills will promote political stability, which is highly possible.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Anniversary of the Capture of Corregidor: Philippine Islands Designated as "Peace and Order Day"; Prime Minister Tojo Yesterday Remotely Viewed the Island and Silently Prayed for the Souls of the Fallen; Highest Authority of the Japanese Expeditionary Force Also Issued a Statement <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Manila, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) After Prime Minister Tojo of Japan arrived here, he was warmly welcomed by the officials and people of the Philippine Islands. The 7th marked the first anniversary of the Japanese army's capture of Corregidor Island. Prime Minister Tojo got up at 5:30 AM, finished washing, and immediately drove to the opposite shore of Manila Bay. At that time, the wind was calm and the sun had just risen. The Prime Minister remotely viewed Corregidor Island floating at the mouth of the bay, filled with emotions. Recalling the fierce fighting of the Japanese army on the island last year and their military achievements, he paid silent respects and prayers to the souls of the fallen who had defended the country. The Philippine Islands Executive Administration has designated this day as "Peace and Order Day" to commemorate it. The people of the whole island are rejoicing, and expressing their best wishes together with Prime Minister Tojo. Manila, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Supreme Commander of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in the Philippine Islands issued a statement on the anniversary of the capture of Corregidor Island, stating: "One year ago today, Corregidor Island was captured by the Japanese army. Since then, the American dominance over the Philippine Islands has been completely eliminated in both name and reality. The Philippine Islands were previously dominated by Spain for more than 400 years, and then by the United States for more than 40 years. It was not until today last year that they were liberated and restored to being the Philippine Islands of East Asia. Therefore, it is truly a day worth commemorating. The slogan 'The Philippine Islands for Filipinos' was established on the day of the capture of Corregidor Island and has a solid and unshakable foundation. After one year, the construction of the new Philippine Islands has made rapid progress in all aspects. The Philippine Islands have designated this day as 'Peace and Order Day,' and the people of the Philippine Islands have regarded the peace and order of the Philippine Islands as their own responsibility, and are working hard to restore and maintain it. This fact is also worth celebrating. Early last year, Prime Minister Tojo declared in the Imperial Diet that he would support the future independence of the Philippine Islands. In late January of this year, he reaffirmed this matter. Furthermore, Prime Minister Tojo personally inspected the construction of the new Philippine Islands amidst his busy military and administrative affairs. This made all the residents of the Philippine Islands deeply feel the spirit of Japanese morality and strive to move towards the construction of the new Philippine Islands. On the occasion of the first anniversary of the capture of Corregidor Island, I would like to express my sentiments and hope that the 18 million residents of our Philippine Islands will strive to rise up."</p>
<p>Celebration Ceremony Held in Manila; Japanese Military Officers Attended and Delivered Speeches</p>
<p>Manila, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) At a time when Japanese Prime Minister Tojo is visiting the Philippines, the 7th also marks the anniversary of the fall of Corregidor Island, the US stronghold for aggression in East Asia. Therefore, the entire Philippines is feeling more inspired than ever. The Philippine Islands Executive Administration held a "Peace and Order Day" ceremony here at 5:00 PM on the 7th. The heads of the Japanese Philippine Islands Army, Navy, and Military Administration Departments, as well as the Philippine Islands Executive Administration Chief Vargas and Interior Minister Laurel, attended and provided guidance. More than 100,000 people participated, and the atmosphere was extremely excited and enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Manila, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army in the Philippine Islands, Tanaka, delivered a speech on the "Peace and Order Day" in the Philippine Islands on the 7th, stating in essence that one year has passed since the fall of Corregidor Island, the last stronghold of the American forces in the Philippine Islands. Today, the Philippine Islands have completely escaped the shackles of the past United States and are developing new Philippine Islands, which is the most memorable event in history and the most satisfying and fortunate event for the 18 million people of the Philippine Islands. I hereby express my congratulations. The Greater East Asia War is fought for the liberation of East Asia and the construction of Asia for Asians. In less than half a year since the start of the war, the strongholds of Anglo-American aggression in East Asia have been completely destroyed. With the retreat of Anglo-American forces, a new era in East Asia is about to be realized. One year ago today, Corregidor fell, and the American forces in the Philippine Islands were completely eliminated. The Philippine Islands also became a new island in the Orient. The people of the new Philippine Islands understand the true intentions of Japan and are working hard under Japanese guidance, which is deeply gratifying. The designation of today as "Peace and Order Day" is sufficient to express the enthusiasm of the Philippine officials and people to cooperate unanimously. During his visit to the Philippine Islands, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo inspected the construction of the new Philippine Islands and witnessed your efforts and cooperation with our country. His belief in the past statement of recognizing independence has also become increasingly firm. I sincerely hope that you will actively cooperate with the same enthusiasm to complete the Greater East Asia War, so that the glorious independence of all 18 million people of the Philippine Islands can be realized as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Manila, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) During his visit to the Philippines, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo specially donated a sum of money and one ton of quinine for general relief in the Philippine Islands, and also handed over subsidies to the Philippine Islands Executive Administrator for distribution to various charitable organizations, educational training centers, Philippine-Japanese language schools, and police training centers.</p>
<p>Navy Ministry Awards Medals and Commendations on the Anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Navy was invincible and repeatedly annihilated the main fleets of Britain and the United States in various decisive naval battles. In particular, the results achieved by the Japanese Navy in the Battle of the Coral Sea on May 6th of last year were enough to shake the world. In this battle, the Japanese naval forces annihilated the joint main fleet of the British and American navies, including more than 20 aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, and shattered their attempts to seize bases such as New Guinea, New Britain, and the Solomon Islands. The next day (7th), the air force of a certain Japanese base, with fierce Japanese anti-aircraft fire, sank one US main battleship of the California class and one A-class cruiser of the Augusta class, and one warship of the Wiesbaden class. At the same time, a certain Japanese mobile unit also eliminated the fierce defense of enemy fighters on the 7th, and in an instant, sank one US aircraft carrier of the Lexington class, and severely damaged one new US main battleship and one cruiser, and shot down 50 enemy aircraft. The results achieved by the Japanese army in this battle were comparable to the results achieved in the naval battles in Hawaii and Malaya. This fully demonstrated the powerful and invincible power of the Japanese Navy. As the glorious Battle of the Coral Sea in the history of the Japanese Navy reaches its anniversary, the Japanese Navy Ministry announced at 3:00 PM on the 7th that the Joint Fleet Commander awarded the mobile unit and the air force of a certain base medals to show their commendation.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announces War Results of Japanese Army in Jin-Yu Province; Communist Army Encircled in Taihang Mountains <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 7th: (1) Our army is currently operating in the vicinity of the Jin-Yu provincial border, engaged in mopping up the remnants of the Yu-affiliated 24th Army Group, and since May 6th, has begun to encircle and attack the headquarters of the Communist 18th Army Group and the 13,000 troops of the Communist Liu Bocheng Army Group. (2) Our army is continuing to mop up the Communist army in the vicinity of the borders of the Jin-Cha-Ji three provinces. (3) The comprehensive war situation of our army in the above two places from April 29th to May 3rd is as follows: Casualties of the Yu-Communist army: 2,300 Yu-Communist troops killed, 2,500 captured. Major spoils: A total of 11 various artillery pieces, 150 heavy and light machine guns, and 3,000 rifles. Our side suffered 169 deaths in action.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Japanese China Expeditionary Army announced the war situation for the past week as follows: Since the Japanese army began the Taihang Mountain operation and the encirclement and annihilation of the Communist 8th Route Army last month, they have annihilated a large number of Yu-Communist troops and achieved great results. Therefore, the morale of the Japanese army's land and air forces has become even stronger, and the intended goals have been almost achieved. They are currently continuing to mop up the remaining Yu-Communist troops. Recently, the Yu side mistakenly believed that the strength of the Japanese China Expeditionary Army had been reduced by half, and ordered various armies to take turns to counterattack, but unexpectedly suffered great losses. The chaos in the Zasak Banner Security Team in the Yu-Erduosi Plains and the open and secret struggles between the Yu and Communist armies in various places have also become increasingly apparent recently, and seem to be impossible to resolve. In the recent operation in the Hehua Province, the Japanese army discovered that the mutual contact between the Yu and Communist armies has been completely cut off, and they have collapsed due to the fierce attacks of the Japanese army. The Japanese army will use a consistent and strong land and air front, and will increase pressure on the Yu army in the future, which will surely make the Yu side realize its miscalculation.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) According to a dispatch from the front lines of the southern Jin-Taihang Mountains on the 7th, the Japanese army in North China, after annihilating the Yu-affiliated 24th Army Group, which had been entrenched in the strategic areas of the southern Taihang Mountains, has achieved brilliant and great war results since the Central Plains Campaign. On the 6th, they launched an encirclement and annihilation battle against the Communist 18th Army Group, which was based in the northern Taihang Mountains. The Japanese army units are now advancing along the Zhengtai Line and the Beijing-Hankou Railway. By noon on the 6th, they had completely encircled the Communist Army Headquarters, the headquarters of the 128th Division Commander Liu Bocheng, and the Taihang and Dayue military regions in the central military region of the Eighth Route Army in North China. The 13,000 Communist troops have become rats in a bag. The Japanese army is currently expanding its war results with the assistance of the air force.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) According to a dispatch from the front lines of the Jin-Pu Taihang Mountains on the 7th, the Japanese army units suddenly changed direction on the morning of the 8th and launched an encirclement and suppression operation against the surrounding area of Matian Town in She County. They then encircled 13,000 troops of the Communist 18th Army Group Headquarters and the main force of the 129th Division. On the dawn of the 7th, they launched a large-scale annihilation battle against the newly編第1旅, 第5旅 and 决死第3纵队 under Liu Bocheng's command within the encirclement circle with the cooperation of the air force. In addition, the Shanxi anti-Communist army and other Chinese armed groups participating in the Japanese army's operations also attacked the Jin-Ji-Yu provincial border area.

At noon today, they launched a bayonet fight several kilometers away from Dongyangguan (12 kilometers northwest of Licheng).</p>
<p>Jin-Ji-Yu Provincial Border, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) After the Japanese army launched an attack on the She County Basin, the base of the Communist 8th Route Army, it had approached Matian Town, the center of its party and government organs, by the afternoon of the 7th.

The Communist army in the area has been cleared. Other Japanese army detachments advanced through Yiyugou towards Xiangyuzhen. Another unit attacked Gaoyandong and Xijingzhen, where the Communist army's arsenal was located, and broke through them separately, before continuing to advance towards Matian Town. At the same time, the Japanese army units advancing also defeated the Communist army in the Macheng and Shuiyu Village area on the morning of the 7th and are now echoing each other and launching a fierce offensive towards the She County Basin.</p>
<p>Ji-Yu Provincial Border, 7th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Japanese army's eastward advancing units attacked the Yu-affiliated 18th Army Group and the Communist 129th Division entrenched in the She County Basin at 2:00 PM on the 7th and successively captured the strongholds of Shuiyu Village (10 kilometers south of Licheng), Xijingzhen, and Lizhen (15 kilometers north of Licheng).

<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch Regarding the relationship between Chongqing and the Communist Party, there have been few blatant frictions recently, but the internal contradictions remain the same. It is reported that Ye Jianying went to Chongqing on April 20th with Gan Biao to meet with Chiang Kai-shek. They discussed with Chiang again about the repeated demands of the Communist army that had not been resolved. The content of the demands is said to be: (1) Improve the supplies for the Communist army, and allocate any possible foreign aid to Chiang's weapons to the Communist army. (2) Chongqing should not hinder the direct transportation line between Yan'an and the Soviet Union. (3) When borrowing money from the United States for the so-called development of the Northwest, a portion of the loan must be allocated for construction costs in the red areas. (4) Lift the spiritual and material blockade of the Communist army. Furthermore, according to reliable sources, frictions between the Chongqing and Communist armies have been increasing recently. For example, the Yu "Security Team" stationed in the Zasak Banner of the Yikezhao League in Suiyuan Province, under the instigation of the Communist bandits, launched a rebellion on March 25th, and the situation is very serious. The means of suppression by Fu Zuoyi, the Yu "Provincial Chairman" and "Security Commander," are both political and military. Huang Shitong (a local brigade commander), the Deputy Commander of the Yikezhao League Garrison, was appointed as the "Commander-in-Chief for the Suppression of the Rebel Army." On the other hand, he incited Qi Yushan, the "Anti-Japanese Detachment Commander" of the Ximeng [West Mongolia], to come forward for mediation, for a political solution. In addition, incidents of conflict between the Yu army and the Communist army near Hongze Lake, south of Xuzhou, have occurred many times since the beginning of this year.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - When the Japanese Minister of the Army Tojo and Chief of Staff Sugiyama hosted a banquet on the 6th to entertain the Military Inspection Group of the National Government of the Republic of China, the leader of the group, General Ye Peng, delivered a speech of thanks on the spot. The main points are recorded as follows: Today, all members of our inspection group are deeply grateful for the grand reception and sincere words given to us by Minister of the Army Tojo and Chief of Staff Sugiyama. Our inspection group has come to your country for sightseeing under the order of the head of our country. We have not only received courtesy and hospitality from your government, but also received a thorough visit with deep affection from Minister Tojo and Chief of Staff Sugiyama, which has given us a new understanding. We are even more grateful. We have always had a considerable understanding of the strength and many advantages of your country. After this visit, we have gained a renewed and more accurate understanding. The entire country of Japan under the posture of decisive battle has already become a great, powerful, and large barracks. In this large barracks, everyone and everything is under the tense activity of the art of war. All the equipment and facilities in this large barracks are fully scientific. In this large barracks, there is no shortage of resources and materials in its own production, construction, and saving movement, and it is indeed able to withstand a long-term war of attrition. The fighters in this large barracks all have the spirit of risking their lives and the belief of winning the Great East Asia War. All of this makes us admire and excites us. The Republic of China is very honored to cooperate and work together with this strong ally. Under the leadership of the Head of State and the [Sun] Yat-sen, the Republic of China resolutely participated in the war. Once participation in the war is implemented, there will be no room for hesitation or wavering. It is a natural and inevitable thing to share weal and woe and depend on each other for life and death. As for the soldiers of the Republic of China, they still have the tradition of ancient heroes, what is this tradition? That is, advocating morality, emphasizing emotion, and not considering gains or losses. Therefore, Chinese soldiers do not consider the conditions required for modern warfare, and do not ask who will win or lose in the future, but only the location of morality and emotion and the direction of determination and action. Because Chinese soldiers have this kind of sentiment, even in unfavorable circumstances, they are willing to sacrifice together for their comrades-in-arms, and they will have no regrets. Moreover, Japan, which is fighting for the liberation of the Great East Asian nations, not only has the belief of winning, but also has the conditions for winning. It is absolutely no problem for such Chinese soldiers and blood-sworn friends to cooperate to the end and fight to the end, which is also a matter of comfort for the senior generals of our two countries. The host said at the banquet that he hoped that our national army would be rebuilt, which made us extremely grateful. Our country will strive not to fail to live up to expectations.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Japanese Chief of the Army Aviation Headquarters, Lieutenant General Yasuda, Issues a Statement <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Yasuda Takeo, the newly appointed Director General of the Japanese Army Aviation and Chief of the Army Aviation Headquarters, issued a statement when meeting with a group of reporters today, the main points of which are as follows:</p>
<p>The United States has recently made exaggerated propaganda, claiming that it will manufacture hundreds of thousands of aircraft or train hundreds of thousands of soldiers, etc. The reason why they make this exaggerated propaganda is that they have no other way to implement besides propaganda, but the huge numbers they mentioned resembling astronomical numbers cannot be ignored. According to recent news, the U.S. aircraft production for this year was 5,000 in January, 5,500 in February, and 6,200 in March. Although its production seems to have increased, the United States focuses on "quantity" and engages in a war of attrition. However, the United States does not have unlimited power, and according to the recent situation, its power has actually reached its peak. At the same time, its large "quantity" is not enough to scare us. In the past, although the enemy forces have always been superior in quantity, in fact, the initiative in the war situation is still in our hands. The reason is that we have a self-strengthening and winning spirit. Therefore, in order to maintain this position, we should work harder in the future and always ensure the quantity necessary for this initiative. Secondly, regarding the quality aspect, the United States has only now claimed that it has manufactured an engine of 1,500 horsepower and is proud of it. We are not only not surprised at all, but also find it naive and ridiculous. Japan has already built this type of engine. When Japanese aircraft bombed Darwin Harbor at the beginning of this month, it was able to fully demonstrate the excellence of Japanese aircraft. There is another important issue, namely the pilot. Because the aircraft is not just a means of transportation, the pilot's skills and spirit must determine the aircraft's power. In other words, it is the so-called "unity of man and machine." The ground maintenance is also extremely important. In short, the land and air must be integrated. Therefore, the reason why the Japanese aviation force is so powerful is that it can fully exert the eight characters "unity of man and machine" and "unity of land and air." Furthermore, in terms of the people's enthusiasm for aviation, in recent times, the people have been able to thoroughly understand the aviation industry and are extremely concerned, and at the same time, the enthusiasm has greatly increased. It is deeply gratifying to see the large increase in personnel participating in the aviation force recently. At this point, I have decided to devote all my efforts to strengthening the aviation combat power with the confidence of self-strengthening and victory, and I am confident that we can always maintain the initiative in air combat. I also hope that the people will fully cooperate. As for our destruction of the British and American air forces, it is inevitable. Regarding the bombing of the American mainland by our aviation force, I don't want to say much about it here. In short, there is a full plan. What I said is completely different from the exaggerated propaganda of the United States that it will bomb Japan and turn it into ruins.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Fierce Counterattack by German-Italian Allied Forces Fierce Battles Unfold East of Mateur American Second Army Suffers Heavy Losses, Offensive Obstructed Port Facilities Along the Coast of Algiers Bombed <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to news from the Tunisian front, after the American Second Army advanced to Mateur, it is now continuing to advance north, east, and southeast. However, due to the brave counterattack of the Axis forces, its offensive seems to have been obstructed. The tank fleets of the German and American armies engaged in fierce battles east of Mateur. The American army lost eleven tanks. After making a small retreat, the Axis forces in that area are setting up solid defensive positions. It is reported that the American army is advancing north with the aim of Philleville, between Lake Bizerte and Lake Achkel, and has occupied Tangbal Achkel on the south bank of Lake Achkel, and is bombarding an area 65 miles away from Bizerte with long-range artillery. However, the German side has completely denied this news, saying that the Axis forces in that area are launching fierce attacks on the powerful American army, and that dive bombers and other aircraft are very active, inflicting great damage on the anti-Axis forces. In addition, in the areas of Medjez el Bab centered on Mejez Erda Creek, fierce battles are unfolding everywhere between the two armies as the Anderson army begins its fierce attack. The British army encountered fierce counterattacks from the Axis forces and a large number of landmines, resulting in numerous deaths.</p>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to the military correspondent of the Hai Tong News Agency: The anti-Axis forces on the western front of Tunisia increased pressure in the central and northern sections on Wednesday, but so far, this attack cannot be regarded as a large-scale offensive like the Easter War. In the isthmus between the Mediterranean Sea and the north bank of Lake Achkel, French rebel forces attacked with the strength of one unit on Wednesday, but were repulsed and suffered heavy casualties. The main purpose of the anti-Axis forces fighting in this area, which includes American forces, may not be to attack Bizerte, but to sweep down from the north and open the narrow road between Philleville and Lake Achkel and Lake Bizerte. Another part of the American army began to advance towards Philleville from the southwest of Mateur, but made little progress as of Wednesday night. A team of American tanks explored the advance east of Mateur and came into contact with German tanks. More than half of the American tanks were lost. As of Wednesday night, the anti-Axis forces had not launched any attacks on the Axis positions in this area or Jebel Kchobda, but the pressure exerted by the anti-Axis forces on Tebourba from the southeast of Mateur was quite strong. It is difficult to say how close the operational troops advancing in that area, including American and British forces, are to Tebourba. The elite troops in the middle of the British First Army, southwest of Chouaouda, are fighting fiercely in Medjez el Bab. There has been no change in the Guercif area. French troops once again attempted to break through from Pont du Fahs and Jebel Djaghdane, and there was almost no fighting on the southern front on Wednesday. The anti-Axis forces began to transfer the Eighth Army troops after the Easter War, and it seems that the First Army has not yet completed its transfer. Large-scale movements of troops from the southeast to the northwest can be seen in the rear of the anti-Axis forces, so it can be predicted that General Anderson may soon launch another large-scale attack on the central part of the German-Italian front.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to news received today by the German News Agency, the anti-Axis forces have repeatedly attacked the middle and northern sections of the Tunisian front, but have been repulsed by the firmly defended German-Italian forces. Thirteen of the twenty-four tanks used have been destroyed east and west of Mateur. According to the communique of the Italian command, on the western section of the Tunisian front, fierce offensives by enemy forces were repeatedly thwarted yesterday. Italian fighter planes and bombers once raided enemy armored vehicle fleets, but due to an accident, dozens of them were bombed and destroyed. Seven British and American planes were shot down by German fighter planes in air battles. Last night, German-Italian heavy bombers bombed port facilities along the coast of Algiers.</p>

<p>Kuybyshev, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Polish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Rosenman, decided to leave the Soviet Union because the Soviet government had severed diplomatic relations with the Polish government-in-exile, and set off from here on the 6th to go to Iran.</p>
<p>Moscow, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - While the anti-Axis side is trying to win over the Soviet Union and Poland to abandon their suspicions and make peace, Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar Vyshinsky suddenly announced today: The Soviet government has ordered senior officials of the Polish Embassy stationed in Kuybyshev to withdraw as soon as possible. It is reported that the leader of the embassy is General Wolikowski, the former Polish military delegation. At the same time, Vyshinsky announced for the first time that there is an agreement between the Soviet Union and Poland, according to which the Polish government agreed to raise six divisions to prepare to fight the German army on the eastern front. However, the Polish leaders delayed in sending the troops, and the Soviet government was forced to impose considerable restrictions on the Polish army. The agreement was signed in 1941. Today, Vyshinsky claimed at a meeting with British and American journalists: The Polish embassy personnel are quite active in espionage activities, especially General Volikowski, who is wholeheartedly training espionage skills in the Soviet Union to promote their implementation. According to unconfirmed news from Kuybyshev, the Polish officials have left Kuybyshev and are heading to Great Britain. At the meeting, Vyshinsky reviewed the causes and consequences of the Soviet-Polish relations. He said that according to the agreement signed in 1941, the Soviet government allowed the Polish side to establish troops in Soviet territory and gave the Polish government a loan of 300 million rubles without interest, the purpose of which was to establish six divisions of Polish troops (30,000 people) and establish an officer training school to fight alongside the Soviet army on the eastern front. As of October 25, 1941, the Polish army had 2,630 officers and 41,561 soldiers. However, although the Polish government and the Polish commander repeatedly assured that the Polish army would immediately join the front line, the date of implementation was repeatedly delayed. By July 1 of the following year, the Polish army was officially completed, but the Polish commander-in-chief used the excuse that the participation of a part of the troops would be inconvenient for the entire military operation, and never sent his troops to the eastern front. Therefore, the Soviet government regarded the Polish army as a non-combat unit and reduced its food supply, but the Polish government still refused to send its troops to the Soviet front.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a telegram from London: Soviet Ambassador to the UK Maisky visited British Foreign Secretary Eden on the night of the 6th and exchanged views on the relations between the Soviet Union and Poland and the new situation caused by Stalin's letter to The Times. The discussion lasted for quite a long time.</p>

<h3 id="e21">Premonition of the Collapse of Britain and the United States The Disintegration of the British Empire <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Robert McCormick, the head of the Chicago Tribune, a powerful newspaper in the central United States, openly declared the disintegration of the British Empire. The ambition to inherit the British legacy is revealed extremely bluntly: territories, even Britain itself, joining a state in the United States, as a quick win for the close ties between Britain and the United States, and a fundamental solution to strengthen the two bonds.</p>
<p>If the real purpose of Britain and the United States is to defeat the Axis, and in the midst of a bloody war, the head of a news agency openly proposes the annexation of an allied country and says that this is his personal opinion, it is really unthinkable from our common sense. Even if we say that disregarding others is the nature of Americans, such unscrupulous remarks cannot but make people speechless. Secondly, when we look at the actual policy of the United States to dominate the world, his claim cannot be said to be a castle in the air of his own imagination. McCormick can really be said to be the spokesperson of the Roosevelt regime.</p>
<p>When the previous Military Lending Act was being deliberated by the U.S. Congress, leaders in the Senate such as Tyden Nye jointly declared that our supply of weapons to the anti-Axis side is not a beautiful thing we are doing. The price of transferring destroyer ships is not enough just to permanently place the British West Indies under the United States, but also requires liquidation in kind. In other words, Britain must use its territory to repay the debt. Vice President Wallace and Undersecretary of State Welles both affirmed this statement, so the division of the British Empire broke the speculation in political circles and became a realistic policy of the United States. McCormick only concretized it further. Furthermore, in terms of the situation in North Africa, Britain and the United States are fighting openly and secretly, each supporting puppet regimes in order to ensure its dominance. Until recently, in the eyes of the United States, there is no longer Deguel nor Giraud. As soon as the situation in North Africa changes, Roosevelt will immediately appoint the current Mayor of New York, LaGuardia, as the Governor of North Africa, preparing to dominate by force. Before Britain and the United States compete for world hegemony, they are ostensibly allies, but secretly harbor a contradictory relationship of hostility. Sparks often fly due to short-term friction.</p>
<p>Canada, the British dominion that has become the object of the British Empire's disintegration theory, has essentially become a state of the United States, and has completely become a branch of the American arsenal because of this war. Australia and New Zealand have also left the British mainland and are under the military control of the United States, and their fate is self-evident. McCormick's personal opinion does not seem to mention India, but the military and economic power of the United States is increasingly penetrating India, and it wants to take advantage of the British mainland's fatigue to replace it. Is this not extremely obvious in their current India policy? Roosevelt, who harbors the ambition to dominate the world, whether he is secretly eroding the British mainland with malice or not, will eventually be difficult to escape the eyes and ears of the world due to future actions. The imminent loss of all British territories except South Africa is already clearly visible. Regardless of whether it is annexed to the United States, Britain has permanently succumbed to the United States.</p>
<p>Where is Britain going? If this war fails, Britain will no longer exist. Even if it does not lose, Britain will inevitably fall into the same state as the current US-Canada relationship. Churchill once made a bold statement claiming "I am not the liquidator of the British Empire," but in the process of the disintegration of the old British Empire, the tragic actor who cannot escape the net cannot but be Churchill himself. (Xiang: Translated from the Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi editorial on April 30)</p>
<h3 id="e22">A Perspective on the American Coal Miners' Strike <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The 450,000 coal miners in Pennsylvania, USA, declared a strike because their demand for a two-dollar increase in wages per day was rejected. Regardless of President Roosevelt's mediation and even threats, they showed a momentum to start implementation on the morning of May 1. The US government seems to be mobilizing the wartime powers of the president to take a military crackdown. Like the previous few strike cases, the government's suppression policy may succeed. However, that does not mean that because the government's suppression is successful and the strike stops, the fundamental problem will be solved.</p>
<p>Moreover, labor disputes in the United States decreased sharply after the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, when the war sentiment reached its peak, but then gradually increased again. The coal mine strike this time, although it has been particularly noticed because the coal mining industry is a vital industry that chokes the life and death of the entire US industry, the large number of strikers, and its union is the most powerful labor organization in the United States, is actually only one example of these gradually increasing labor disputes. Therefore, even if this strike can be resolved early, the universal unease and internal contradictions in the US business and labor circles cannot be eliminated.</p>
<p>As is well known, the entire wartime economic structure of the United States is being shaken by the terrible threat of inflation. The root cause of most labor disputes is the anxiety about life caused by inflation. Needless to say, the US government's countermeasure lies in thoroughly preventing malignant inflation. Therefore, it is focusing all its efforts on severe price and wage fixing. However, as a result, only prices are rising, and wages cannot rise accordingly. Therefore, its suppression policy applied to labor disputes will inevitably further intensify the anxiety and hardship of labor life.</p>
<p>This Great East Asia War was caused by Roosevelt's war-mongering policy, as is now well known to the general American public. After the start of the war, the entire American people supported the war on the condition of minimal sacrifice. Are Americans still able to sing the praises of this unreasonable war everywhere when they are afraid of their own life anxiety? The United States, boasting abundant resources and productivity, originally had such ideological weaknesses and bottlenecks. However, we are not deliberately exaggerating the enemy's weaknesses here. Moreover, this strike incident not only hinders production and increases social unrest, but also cannot but be regarded as a great stimulant to the ideological turmoil of the American people. (Ding: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun editorial on May 2)</p>
<h3 id="e23">The American Labor Strike Has Not Been Truly Resolved <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The American coal miners' strike, which was once expected to worsen, is said to have been decided to resume work uniformly on the morning of the 4th. The coal mining industry, which controls the life and death of American industry, will certainly not be shut down permanently due to labor disputes during wartime. Although it is still unclear what the terms of the settlement are, it goes without saying that the resolution is not a real solution, regardless of the terms.</p>
<p>The first thing clearly exposed by this strike is the state of imbalance between prices and wages. With the deepening of the war, the expansion of military production, and the reduction of civilian material production, becoming inversely proportional and diverging is inevitable. The development of this situation will definitely intensify the tendency of price and wage imbalances, becoming a terrible threat to the lives of all laborers. Temporary wage agreements are therefore successively required to be revised, which leads to labor disputes that affect the entire production field, and agricultural production is also affected. Increasing wages due to rising prices, and rising prices due to increased wages, this kind of repetition, I am afraid there will be no end, and general economic chaos arises from this.</p>
<p>The second thing exposed by this strike is the labor side's distrust of the American government—especially the wartime labor bureau. In this strike, the union's demands were based on direct labor-management negotiations, rejecting the labor bureau's mediation. Isn't this a major insult to the authority of the American government? It is said that Americans have always disregarded all laws and authority in order to protect their own interests, and this dispute clearly expresses this characteristic. It is not difficult to imagine what kind of anxiety is involved in carrying out a long-term war shaken by the attitude of the laboring masses.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether this strike has been quickly resolved, it is an undeniable fact that it has exposed one of America's greatest weaknesses. Needless to say, we must be careful not to overestimate the enemy's weaknesses. However, seeing this chaos in the enemy's camp, we can instead renew our determination to improve domestic preparedness. (Ding: Translated from the May 4th Asahi Shimbun editorial)</p>

<h3 id="e25">Director of Intelligence Hirota Issues a Statement:  Chongqing and Australia's Attempts to Induce Britain and the United States to Change Their Policies Have Completely Failed <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Hirota, the spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, declared yesterday at a reception for foreign journalists: Chongqing and Australia's attempts to induce Britain and the United States to change their policy of "solving Europe first," which was decided at the Casablanca Conference in January, have completely failed. Hirota also issued a warning that Japan will, of course, take advantage of the current situation in the Southwest Pacific to inflict severe blows on the anti-Axis powers. Since the current environment is extremely favorable to Japan, Japan will certainly not remain silent and allow the golden opportunity to pass. According to reports, Australia and Chongqing realized in February and March that the Casablanca Conference resolution was unfavorable to them, and then appealed to Britain and the United States to change the above policy, but the result of their appeal was almost zero. Britain and the United States did not change the policy, but guaranteed that they would consider various possible assistance to Chongqing and Australia within the scope of that policy. Therefore, Chongqing and Australia's disappointment and failure are self-evident. Hirota continued that Australia had sent its Foreign Minister, Dr. Evatt, on a special trip to the United States to make a plea for justice. Other advocates for changing the anti-Axis plan included Prime Minister Curtin, General Macworth, Sir Brabe, and Kanner. On the Chongqing side, Soong Mei-ling, T.V. Soong, and Dr. Hu Shih were also sent to the United States at the same time. Although they had the support of Generals Stilwell and Chennault, the hope of their mission succeeding was still remote. Hirota said that the two generals had already returned, so there was no doubt that they had accomplished nothing. At this point, Hirota quoted an article published in Chongqing newspapers by Yang Jie, the former ambassador to the Soviet Union, detailing the situation in Australia, which had become increasingly miserable due to the anti-Axis powers' implementation of the current policy in the Pacific. He also said that the so-called "solve Europe first" plan made Australian defense extremely dangerous, and Japan was bound to take advantage of this weakness to launch an attack. He issued a further warning that Australia was vulnerable to Japanese attacks everywhere, and that only by strengthening the military forces in the Pacific could the anti-Axis powers cope. In other words, the anti-Axis powers had admitted their strategic weakness in the Pacific. Hirota concluded that Japan would certainly not allow this situation to continue, and that it had been able to take full advantage of the situation in the South Pacific since the beginning of May in terms of military achievements.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Rickshaw Pullers Extorting Extra Fees:  Police Department Decides to Crack Down. Deputy Superintendent Okawa Issues Statement <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Okawa, Deputy Superintendent of the Traffic and Air Defense Department of the Shanghai Municipal Police, issued a statement regarding the rickshaw pullers' extortion of liquor money from customers, stating: According to the newly revised price list for rickshaw rentals, tips are already included. Passengers have no need to give any additional expenses other than the official fare. If rickshaw pullers forcibly extort money in the future, passengers can report to the nearest police station, providing the name of the rickshaw company to which the rickshaw puller belongs, the registration number, and the uniform number. After receiving the report, the police station will impose penalties such as suspension of business for a few days or dozens of days, or even permanent cancellation of the license, depending on the severity of the circumstances.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers' Income Is Already Not Meager</p>
<p>According to the newly revised price list, every 30 minutes costs 12 yuan, and the rickshaw puller can get one-third of the profit (i.e., 4 yuan). Judging from the current work situation, each rickshaw puller can make at least six trips a day. Even with this minimum number of trips, the rickshaw puller's income is already not meager. Moreover, there are times when there are ten trips, then the income is even greater. Therefore, there is no need to give liquor money anymore.</p>

<h3 id="e28">National Forum: The Urgent Need to Rectify the International Settlement's Guards, Detectives, and Prison Personnel <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Chengkang</p>
<p>For nearly a century, our country's administrative power has been fragmented by "International Settlements," "extraterritoriality," and other unequal treaties. Millions of people living in the International Settlements have been living a life of oppressed slavery under foreign power. In the eyes of foreigners, we have never been treated as human beings. The advertisement in the park, "Dogs and Chinese are not allowed," fully exposes the truth of this statement. Over the years, there have been countless cases of guards, detectives, and prison personnel in the International Settlements torturing and killing our innocent civilians. The recent Zhang Jinhai case is merely an indication that this trend is continuing.</p>
<p>After the Zhang case occurred, his family members and people of justice from all walks of life organized a public group to provide legal aid, which should be handled reasonably. However, the occurrence of this case deeply made one feel how to rectify the guards, detectives, and prison personnel in the International Settlements. With the International Settlements about to be returned, this is indeed an urgent task. I would like to briefly offer my humble opinions as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Eradicate the slavish mentality of flattering foreigners and bullying our own people. The main culprits in the abuse of citizens in the International Settlements are foreigners. However, without Chinese people acting as their pawns, it would be difficult to achieve anything. Chinese cadres who have been educated by foreigners for a long time are anesthetized by them and are willing to act as accomplices and be exploited. We absolutely do not want to despise these anesthetized compatriots, but rather pity them and sympathize with them, and think of ways to educate them so that they can extricate themselves from the devil's lair. In the camp of building a new China, we still need this group of reinforcements who are familiar with the local situation. The solution to the problem should first find the root cause and prescribe the right medicine, so that chronic diseases can be cured. Now, when the giant evil has been removed and the dawn is approaching, we must not ignore this group of political personnel lurking in all levels of the International Settlements—this group of former pawns who were poisoned by British and American colonialism and used to harm us. We should eradicate evil completely and quickly eliminate the slavish mentality lurking in their hearts. Otherwise, the weeds will not be eradicated, and they will grow again in the spring breeze, inevitably causing future troubles!</p>
<p>(2) Cultivate a pro-people, loving, and serving spirit: In a country that values people's livelihood, even the President is just a public servant of the people. It should be known that the power of public servants to govern people is entirely granted by the vast majority of the people. Therefore, public servants should exercise their powers with the happiness of the majority of the people as the premise. The scope of authority is clearly defined, and exceeding this is an abuse of power. Abuse of power is a criminal act stipulated by criminal law, and even high-ranking officials are no exception. The country uses criminal law because education is inadequate, so it is actually a last resort. The purpose of criminal law is to promote repentance and hope for self-renewal. There is a deep meaning of "a loving mother scolding her son for his own good" here, so police personnel should try to reduce all unnecessary physical and mental pain for criminals when performing their duties.</p>
<p>The urgent need to rectify the police personnel in the International Settlements is as described above. We hope that the relevant authorities will prepare countermeasures in advance so that the people in the International Settlements after the takeover will no longer suffer from the harsh government that has caused them so much distress for a century.

All Sectors Support the Case with a Solemn Attitude <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the case of Zhang Jinhai, an apprentice at the Chengji Shirt and Socks Factory in the French Concession, who died, the Municipal Government has investigated the entire case and confirmed the facts, and protested to the French Consul General yesterday, stating: "It has been verified by the Shanghai Second Special District Court that Zhang Jinhai was injured before his death and died. The Western police officers handled this case without following legal procedures, abused illegal torture, and caused death, which is extremely reckless and illegal. We hereby lodge a serious protest and hope that you will investigate and instruct the Municipal Council to strictly punish the Western police officers who have committed dereliction of duty and homicide in accordance with the law, and reserve the right to demand compensation and consolation for the deceased's family, and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again in the future, in order to value people's lives. We look forward to your reply."</p>
<p>The Second Special District Court Reports on the Process</p>
<p>The Second Special District Court attached great importance to the case of Zhang Jinhai being brutally tortured to death by the French police and has submitted the facts to the Ministry of Justice. The original text reads: "This case involves the French Concession Police Department reporting on April 30 that Zhang Jinhai died of illness." According to the report, "The deceased was 19 years old, from Zhenjiang, and worked as a clerk at the Lafai Chengji Socks and Shirt Factory at No. 292 Caishi Road in this city. On the afternoon of April 29 this year, he was arrested in connection with the case of Peng Shuanglong, an apprentice at the factory, being accused of misappropriating lost property. Unexpectedly, at 6:00 AM on the 30th, Zhang Jinhai suddenly fell ill and died after medical treatment. Please send personnel to inspect the body immediately." At that time, since Zhang Jinhai was arrested and interrogated in connection with the case and suddenly died of illness, it was quite suspicious. Personnel were sent to inspect the body and found that the corpse was strong on the outside, with multiple injuries to the temples and the left rib area, which was obviously not a death due to illness. Therefore, it was ordered that an autopsy be performed the next day. The next morning, the family members of the deceased, Zhang Hesheng and others, filed a report stating: "Zhang Jinhai and Peng Shuanglong were illegally tortured by the Western detectives in the police station, resulting in one death and one injury. Please investigate thoroughly." At 3:00 PM that day, the Chief Prosecutor personally supervised the Prosecutor, forensic doctor, and clerk to go to the corpse inspection site on Terrace Road. The French police doctor Saunders and his Chinese assistant doctor Zhao Kaishu were present and jointly performed an autopsy on Zhang Jinhai's body. The autopsy revealed subcutaneous bleeding in the head and ribs, and a ruptured spleen, which was caused by serious injuries leading to death (please refer to the forensic report). When interrogating Mirei, the French detective in charge of the case, he did not admit to the use of illegal torture. However, Zhang Jinhai was healthy and without illness at the time of his arrest, which the detective admitted on the spot. However, he died suddenly less than a day after being arrested and interrogated, which proves that the injuries found during the inspection were real. Moreover, according to Peng Shuanglong's statement, he described in detail how Zhang Jinhai was beaten and water was poured on him after being arrested, which was by no means fabricated. The injuries on his own body have not completely healed after many days of treatment (please refer to the injury report and the transcript of May 4). Therefore, it is impossible for the Western detective to have interrogated the case without severe torture, which resulted in one death and one injury. His reckless disregard for human life and violation of humanity are inexcusable. In addition to lodging a serious verbal protest with the judicial advisor of the French Concession Administration, we will submit a report for your review after the negotiations have been satisfactorily concluded. In addition to lodging a verbal protest with the French Concession Administration, the court has also sent a written protest to Hubert, the judicial advisor of the French Concession Administration."</p>
<p>Chinese and French Authorities Meet to Negotiate</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Minister of Justice Zhu Junyi, after arriving in Shanghai, has listened to reports from all parties regarding the tragic death of Zhang Jinhai and is now quietly observing the development of the case. Gu Shuo, Deputy Director of the Ministry of Justice's Shanghai Office, along with Secretary Fei and Peng Wangshi, Counselor of the Ministry of Justice, met with Police Superintendent Fabre of the French Police Department at 12:00 noon yesterday, on behalf of the judiciary, to begin legal negotiations, arguing based on reason. They only broke up around 1:00 PM. It is reported that French Concession Police Superintendent Fabre expressed that he was willing to handle the case fairly. However, since the citizens are outraged, the Police Department still has the right to take all necessary measures to maintain order within the concession in the event of unexpected incidents. However, our side gave a stern rebuttal, stating that this matter is unrelated to fair handling, and that the occurrence or non-occurrence of unexpected events will depend on whether or not the handling is fair. Since China and France have always had friendly relations, the French side will certainly not be partial.</p>
<p>Unexpected Complications Arise During the Autopsy</p>
<p>The body of Zhang Jinhai, who was brutally tortured to death, has been examined by the Chinese and French judicial authorities, and it has been confirmed that he died from serious injuries beyond any doubt. However, during the autopsy, French doctor Saunders argued that Zhang's spleen was larger than that of an average person and could rupture and bleed at any time, causing death. At that time, Zhang's spleen was divided into two parts, each holding one part. The French side has sent it to Aurora University for chemical analysis, but our forensic doctor disagrees, believing that there is nothing unusual about it.</p>
<p>Director Feng's Thoughts</p>
<p>Feng Jie, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Propaganda Department, said that after the occurrence of this case, he could not help but sigh at this inhuman and tragic event. This type of incident is commonplace in Shanghai under the influence of British and American aggression for a century. However, since December 8 of last year, the situation in Shanghai has become increasingly clear, and the French patrol police are still acting in violation of the meaning of the times, which is no wonder why the general public is deeply resentful. We should know that China and its friendly neighbor Japan are cooperating in the liberation of East Asian nations and seeking to restore their innate independence and freedom from a century of oppression, which is not arrogance or xenophobia. All friendly nations in Europe and Asia should be treated with sympathy. I hope that the French Concession authorities will recognize this significance and severely punish these illegal and brutal police officers who bully and despise the lives of Chinese people, which would be the wisest measure. I especially hope that our society will maintain a bright attitude, use civilized means, and proceed legally to seek a satisfactory resolution to this case.</p>
<p>Media Support</p>
<p>Regarding the case of Zhang Jinhai being brutally tortured to death by the French police, Zhang Yuanji, the father of the deceased, submitted a report to the Shanghai Press Association yesterday, stating: "My son, Jinhai, was brutally tortured to death. The French police are so reckless and lawless. If they are not punished as they deserve, then the injustice will forever sink to the bottom of the sea. Please provide strong support so that the injustice can be redressed and the murderers can be brought to justice." After receiving the report, the Press Association decided at its seventh board meeting to send a letter of reply to Zhang Yuanji and instruct member newspapers to strongly support this tragic case, in order to achieve the goal of punishing the murderers, providing compensation, and ensuring that similar incidents do not happen again in the future.</p>
<p>Hearing at the French Consulate</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, the French Consulate General continued to hold a hearing for all the defendants in the case, which did not end until 2:00 PM in the afternoon. Detective Wang Shu recounted the entire incident, how Mirei ordered the use of torture, and how Guo Shiyuan, together with others, tied up Zhang Jinhai with ropes and threw him to the ground to inflict torture. The Second Special District Court is scheduled to hold a preliminary hearing this morning, and subpoenas have been issued.</p>
<p>Support from All Sides</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency in Shanghai, various civic groups in the city held a representative meeting at 1:00 PM yesterday. Those who attended included the Shanghai Branch of the East Asia League, the Chinese National Anti-British and American Association, the Chinese Construction Youth Team, the Chinese Hongmen United Association, the East Asia Anti-Communist Alliance, the Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association, the Zhenjiang Fellow-Countrymen Association, the Xuzhou Sojourner Association, and from the friendly country, Hideo Nishimura of the Shanghai Xingya Association, no fewer than twenty people in total. It was unanimously resolved that each group would jointly issue a declaration and send telegrams to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Justice of the National Government and petition the Municipal Government to make serious representations to the French authorities. The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipality Second Special District Branch of the Chinese Nationalist Party has sent a letter to the French Police Department and reported to higher authorities to transfer to various authorities for effective sanctions. The French Concession Taxpayer Chinese Association and the Second Special District Citizens' Association advocated severe punishment. In addition, fifteen groups, including the Municipal Agricultural Association, the Taxpayer Chinese Association, the Citizens' Association, and the National Li Jiao Association, held a joint meeting yesterday and unanimously resolved to establish a Zhang Jinhai Case Support Association, which has set up a correspondence address at No. 1 Jinchang Lane, Fangbang Road, Nanshi, inside the Municipal Agricultural Association. Shanghai groups also issued a joint declaration yesterday.</p>

<p>The city's second phase of household oil began to be sold universally by retail oil stores from 9:00 AM yesterday (the 7th). A few oil stores in urban areas, due to incomplete oil withdrawal procedures, will extend sales to the 10th. The designated oil purchase locations for each household in this phase are the same as in the first phase. Therefore, residents can purchase soybean oil from the original oil store by presenting their house donation ticket (public concessions rely on winter donation tickets, French concessions rely on January and February donation tickets) or household registration card doorplate certificate, along with the head of household's citizen card or identity residence certificate. Oil stores that began selling oil yesterday will stop selling on the 17th. The duration of this phase of household oil is a total of ten days, and the time and quantity of household oil sold in this phase are sufficient to fully meet residents' purchases, so each household does not need to rush.</p>

<p>Misappropriation of Huge Sum of Money Recovered: Jing Fengxiang, a clerk of Fuxin Company in Room 35606, Beijing Road, Shanghai, and others, embezzled 600,9087 old French currency between June and October of the 30th year of the Republic of China, using the convenience of their positions, and fled without a trace. The company reported the case to the Central Police Station, requesting an investigation. Now, Chief Detective Zhu Mengwei, Detective Wu Yaozu, and Detective Mao Yunlong learned that Jing was hiding in Shangbai, Hangzhou, so they rushed to the area a few days ago and, together with the local police bureau, arrested Jing and brought him back to Shanghai. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Special District Court. Because the accomplices still needed to be investigated, the court ordered him to be detained and the hearing was postponed.</p>

<p>In the three volleyball league matches the night before last, the Qing team played against the White Goose team in the women's division. The score in the first game was quite close, but the Qing team finally won with a score of 21 to 15. In the second game, the White Goose's counterattack was ineffective, and the Qing team won again. In conclusion, the Qing team defeated the White Goose team in straight sets, creating a great record of three wins in three games. There is still one last game left, which is against the Red and Black team, which is of mediocre strength, and they should be able to secure the championship. Therefore, the women's division championship is already in the bag for the Qing team. In the other two Group B matches, the Public Security Team and the Joint Team defeated the Hua Feng Team and the Air Team, respectively.</p>

<h3 id="e35">Economic Circles: Raising a Major Production Sector <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Not many days ago, the Food Ministry's Water Management Bureau, in order to improve aquaculture techniques and increase fish production, specifically formulated the Interim Measures for Specially Contracted Fish Ponds. The authorities have now paid attention to fisheries, a major production sector in our country.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, our country's producers all focus on the development of agriculture, forestry, industry, and mining. Agriculture is the source of our main food supply, forestry is necessary for building materials, industry is the lifeblood of all production, and mining is the development of natural resources. Their importance is self-evident. However, in today's high-pitched calls for increasing various productions, the aquatic products sector should also be given attention. This is because aquatic products can not only supplement food but also serve as fertilizers for agriculture and as supplies for medicine and industry. Japan's developed fisheries are the best in East Asia, with more than one million people engaged in fishing, occupying a very important position in the country's production line.</p>
<p>Our country's coastline stretches for more than 15,000 li, coupled with the vastness of rivers and the abundance of lakes, making the potential for various aquatic products no less than that of other countries. The number of fishermen is countless, but certainly not small. However, the plight of fishermen's lives reflects the immaturity of our country's fisheries. Therefore, imports of fish have always been a major item annually. Therefore, vigorously promoting fisheries cannot be delayed. This includes the cultivation of fish species, the improvement of fishing methods, and the research of storage methods. Even the financial sector's turnover of funds for fisheries should be regarded as equally important as agricultural finance. If we can develop our rich aquatic resources amidst the calls for increased production, we can not only solve a part of our country's food problem but also promote another major production sector.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Rural Loan Syndicate: Jiaotong Bank's Investigation Work in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces Concludes a Stage; Detailed Organizational Measures Are Under Study <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>All parties hope that the Rural Loan Syndicate will be established soon. Jiaotong Bank is paying close attention to this matter. Since last year, it has organized rural investigation teams and sent them to various rural areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to conduct on-the-spot investigations separately, which have now concluded a stage. The bank is currently studying the methods of agricultural loans. It is also reported that the content and results of the bank's investigation are as follows:</p>
<p>Investigation Focus</p>
<p>There are approximately six items listed on the left: (1) The actual situation of rural transportation, especially the traffic conditions of rural roads and rivers, as well as the situation of cash transactions and the movement of materials. (2) Local financial situation. (3) The condition of agricultural warehouses in various major villages. (4) The living conditions of farmers. (5) The shortage of agricultural products in various places. (6) Soil quality and special conditions in various places. Jiaotong Bank is planning to formulate appropriate measures based on the results of the previous investigation. The general financial community hopes that the bank will actively engage in it in the future.</p>
<p>Current Shortcomings</p>
<p>According to the investigation report of the team, the current rural lending has the following shortcomings: (1) The lending interest rates are not uniform. For example, in a certain county in Jiangsu Province, the interest rate for the same loan varies by several times. (2) The loan amounts are either too large or too small, with no fixed standard. (3) Banks cannot cooperate with each other and engage in mutual exclusion. (4) Most banks do not establish branches locally, and their tasks are performed by local administrative organs, leading to various malpractices. (5) Loans are monopolized by landowners, and farming farmers can still only borrow at high interest rates. (6) Cooperatives have not broken away from the nature of rationing materials. Credit cooperatives have not yet developed.</p>
<p>Research Methods</p>
<p>Referring to the above-mentioned actual situations, the following lending methods are currently being studied: (1) The establishment of a joint loan syndicate is a matter of urgency. (2) Establish a cooperative treasury. The main purpose of this treasury is lending. Without such an organization, it will be impossible to provide loans to tenant farmers that are beneficial to increasing agricultural production. (3) The biggest problem in increasing agricultural production at present is water management, so loans are even more necessary. (Cloud Peng: Translated from the Mainland News of May 7)</p>
<h3 id="e37">Banking and Trust Business: To Be Divided in the Future; Trust Accounting of Each Bank to Be Independent <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>In order to clearly define the business scope of banks and trust companies, and to restrain unsound banks from engaging in various illegal businesses through trust operations to promote hoarding and speculation, the financial authorities, based on the "Provisional Regulations on Trust Companies," will clearly divide the business of banks and trust companies in the future. In the past, general banks operated trust business through trust departments, and the accounting was not independent. In the future, the accounting will be independent to facilitate the supervision of the authorities. The business scope and accounting items of the trust department will include the following: (1) Property directory. (2) Receipt and application of trust funds. (3) Raising of government bonds, corporate bonds, stocks, and other securities. (4) Commodity guarantee. (5) Commodity registration. (6) Agent for the sale of securities. (7) Real estate sales and mortgages. (8) Agent for insurance. (9) Other trust businesses.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Jiangsu and Zhejiang Spring Cocoons to Be Launched on the Market; Transactions Between Firms and Dealers for Spring Cocoon Loans; Stipulation that Loans Should Be Handled Carefully <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Jiangsu and Zhejiang fresh cocoons are harvested in three periods each year: spring, summer, and autumn, but spring cocoons are the most important. Now the Geng Chen spring cocoons are about to be launched on the market. The Japanese and Chinese silk manufacturers and silk cocoon merchants in this city have prepared to purchase from various cocoon-producing areas and have signed loan contracts with various firms and dealers for cocoon collection. The loan amounts transacted in recent days are quite large. The contract specifies the amount, interest rate, and term, which is short-term in nature and should not exceed three months. It is also necessary to submit documents stating the name of the local cocoon dealer to be purchased from. Only after the examination is qualified can the loan be granted, and the collected cocoons will be used as collateral. A reputable guarantor is required to be jointly and severally liable. The self-raised capital for the loan must be at least 50% or more. If the cocoon harvest is not good and cannot be collected in full, the remaining amount should be deposited with the lending firms and dealers in full. If additional funds are required due to insufficient funds due to the influx of goods, it will be discussed separately. During the cocoon collection period, the lending firms and dealers will send personnel to monitor until the dried cocoons are transported to the destination warehouse. At the same time, the lending firms and dealers will provide full insurance to ensure safety. In addition, before the collected cocoons are sold, it is allowed to use the cocoons as collateral to apply for loans from the original lending firms and dealers to seek circulation of funds. The mortgage discount will be handled according to the market price.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that there are 22 large silk mills in various parts of Central China, with 697 furnaces, and 350 small-scale factories, with 6,000 furnaces. They have already started work. Since the China Silk Industry Company, which was established last month, obtained a loan of 50 million yuan from the financial community of this city, the company has actively prepared to collect silkworm cocoons. It is reported that the company has dispatched personnel in batches to Wuxi, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Wuxing, and other places to purchase silkworm cocoons. The company also plans to set up a factory in Wuxi to produce silk.</p>

<p>Usami Yoshihiko, Director of the China Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Greater East Asia, attended the Japanese-side judicial and procuratorial conference in Nanjing from the 4th. He arrived in Ning on the 3rd from Japan. On the 6th, he expressed his feelings about coming to China at the official residence of the Japanese ambassador, saying that the procuratorial conference in China is held once a year. I attended the meeting this time and inspected the local situation. I was pleased to see that the Japanese agencies in the area were able to do their best to implement the new policy. At the same time, the Chinese side is also full of enthusiasm, echoing Japan's new policy and striving to fulfill its due responsibilities. At this time of wartime economy, a wartime system should be established. China's wartime economic system is also gradually being established, which is highly anticipated. The amount of materials mobilized on the mainland this year will be the same as the amount mobilized last year. The transaction between Japan and the mainland will be carried out by the Trading Corporation. With its existing opportunities, it should be easy to deal with the abolition of extraterritoriality and the investigation of state-owned companies in order, step by step. The authorities should be responsible for seeking its realization as soon as possible. However, there are many technical problems. The transfer of consular jurisdiction and police power will also cause various problems technically. It is easier to implement the transfer of taxation power, so I believe that the abolition of extraterritoriality should start with taxation power. It is heard that Director Usami is scheduled to leave here on the 7th, go to North China and Mongolia for inspection, and then return to Shanghai on the 16th to inspect the local situation.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Reason and Emotion <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>-- Bu Ren</p>
<p>I believe that emotion is like an invisible engine in our bodies, and reason is the driver. These two are very important to life and cannot be lacking. Having only a powerful engine without proper driving often leads to derailment and accidents. Conversely, having only a skilled driver without a good engine is also futile, as it cannot reach the destination or achieve anything.</p>
<p>Therefore, having rich emotions can drive us to strive forward, be brave in undertaking tasks, and even do great things that benefit the world at the expense of ourselves. Look at ancient and modern China and abroad, how many figures are recorded in history, which one is not a person with rich emotions? However, rich emotions must naturally be controlled by sufficient and perfect reason.</p>
<p>Everyone has reason, and everyone has emotion. But unfortunately, some are strong in reason and weak in emotion, and some are rich in emotion and clumsy in reason. Therefore, those who focus on reason accuse some passionate people of "acting on impulse," and those who are rich in emotion ridicule those who focus on reason as "insensitive." In fact, the weight of reason and emotion on the road of life should be about the same. If we overemphasize reason, not to mention how lonely and cold this society will become, how monotonous and boring life will become, it will also make you timid, fearful, compromise with reality, and achieve nothing. But having only passion and lacking reason is like a blind man riding a blind horse, which will take you to dangerous situations and often leave you with many regrets and remorse in the future.</p>
<p>The "perfect person" in our ideal should be: both equipped with a good and powerful engine - proper and rich emotions; and also have the skill of a shrewd and capable driver - full and perfect reason. In this way, we can properly drive us towards the realm of "beauty" and "goodness"! Failure is always going to happen.</p>
<p>Money is lost, time is wasted, career fails, why? Intoxicated in "gambling," on the hope of luck!</p>
<h3 id="e49">Counting Pennies <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>-- Gong Chang</p>
<p>In today's difficult living conditions, it is really not easy to provide children with books. Take myself as an example, but two children are in elementary school, and the cost per semester is almost 400 yuan, including tuition of 230 yuan, books and paper of 110 yuan, pen and ink supplies of 33 yuan, and other miscellaneous expenses of 10 yuan. This amount is nothing to the rich, but for us salary-earning classes struggling on the starvation line, we usually have to borrow from the future or have no savings at all. It takes a lot of effort to raise this amount of money! As a parent, I have carefully considered ways to reduce the burden. Tuition fees are used to maintain school expenses and teachers' lives. Except for public and private subsidies, there is no hope of reducing them. So I started counting pennies on books and paper.</p>
<p>1. Utilize old books: It is common to see some elementary school students throwing books around after using them, which is a pity. Books that used to cost a few cents each now sell for one or two yuan, and sometimes you can't even buy them if you want to. I think parents and teachers should do their best to help children cherish books. At the end of each semester, choose the most dilapidated ones, collect them back at a discounted price, and keep them for the next class to use. In this way, a book can be read by several classes of students until it is no longer usable. The book itself has exerted its maximum effect, and the burden on parents' book expenses can be slightly reduced.</p>
<p>2. Save paper consumption: Children do not know the difficulty of material resources and waste paper, which is shocking. It is not uncommon to write a few lines on a piece of paper and then not use it again. We must teach them ways to save as much as possible. There should be no empty lines or spaces, and even pencil writing should be added with ink, and the front side should be written and the back side should be written. The paper itself exerts its maximum effect, and the burden on parents' paper expenses can also be reduced slightly.</p>
<p>The poor count pennies, maybe someone will ridicule me like this. But you must know that saving a penny of material resources is increasing the country's vitality by one point, which is not a small problem.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Views on Reading, Past and Present <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>-- Ren Chuan</p>
<p>In the feudal era, "reading" was originally the exclusive possession of the emperors, scholars, and officials. The children of farmers and workers, who were considered lowly, were not qualified to receive the same education. This selfish mentality was nothing more than a product of class society. "Learning well leads to officialdom" was nothing more than a way to maintain their throne high above people's heads. The imperial examination system was nothing more than the emperors' policy of deceiving the people, wanting to buy people's hearts with wealth and glory, and to win over talents from all over the world into my trap, to put it bluntly, it was nothing more than wanting to maintain the foundation of all generations without decline.</p>
<p>The traditional concept is that "reading" is considered the only shortcut to obtaining fame and wealth: "No one knows you after ten years of studying by the window, but you become famous overnight, and the world hears about it." Isn't that enough to be proud? Moreover, "There are beauties like jade in books, there are golden houses in books, there are thousands of bushels of millet in books." These slogans, full of exaggerated and tempting colors—beauties, money, and life, strung together on a rotten rope of fame and wealth—are they not enough to bind the hearts of readers?</p>
<p>Therefore, the readers of the past regarded themselves very highly, looked down on farmers and workers, and naturally, they did not distinguish between beans and wheat, thinking it was a matter of course.</p>
<p>However, although classes cannot be completely dismantled now, the specific walls have been overthrown. Reading has been stipulated as an obligation that every citizen should fulfill, and the country has compulsory education. The concept has also been liberated from the narrow fame and expanded from the individual enjoyment of the small self to the happiness of the group. Reading is to accept the valuable heritage of the predecessors—knowledge, experience, and to use it to verify, cooperate, improve, and create with reality. You must not close your eyes and think, but also open your eyes and see, and you must work hard with your hands and feet. From abstract to practical, from dead knowledge to active application, all this is the difference between reading in the past and the present!</p>
<h3 id="e51">Gambling <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>-- Sha Lei</p>
<p>"What is obtained by luck will surely be lost by luck!" This is an immutable famous saying.</p>
<p>"Gambling" is a temporary victory of luck, but it is bound to be a permanent failure.</p>
<p>Hope rooted in luck is like a kite with a broken string, soaring into the sky, swaying, proud, excited, and in delusion. What follows is: somersaulting straight down from the clouds, panic, dismay, annoyance, frustration, and a slumped fall to the ground, with broken bones and a shattered skull. And the "gambling game" is exactly the same as it.</p>
<p>Stubbornly believing that "gambling" also has successful victories, thinking that this will not be different from the general practice - failure is the mother of success, in each situation, creating a hope, and pushing the bet up. However, hope mocks him, and disappointment whips him. Because this hope is a castle in the air. If you walk a road or do a job, as long as you work hard and persevere, where there's a will, there's a way. But "gambling" is pursuing a mirage in the shame sea, trying to build a tower of success on the soft sand.</p>
<p>In many other things, hundreds of failures, only one success is needed to lay the foundation stone of victory! "Gambling"? Ninety-nine victories, one failure, and it is not difficult to abandon all the achievements, and the proportion is always 99% on the side of gambling.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Ambition <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>-- Yale</p>
<p>Many senior gentlemen have instructed us on the principles of youth cultivation and the essence of success. In summary, it is that young people should have knowledge and ambition, so that there is hope for development.</p>
<p>The so-called ambition is to use all our spirit and wisdom combined with the greatest courage to strive for the realization of ideals. Therefore, ambition may be "possessed by everyone," but due to different purposes, the result of ambition can be good or evil. The most prominent of the evil situations is the "hoarding" of a few people. Ambition has succeeded, but it has made countless people suffer. Therefore, things like hoarding are not ambition, but black-heartedness. Once a person's heart is black, they can violate their conscience and do all kinds of evil!</p>
<p>As for the good situation, such as improving people's livelihood, etc., it still needs to be pioneered and created by ambitious people. Therefore, I absolutely agree that a person's ambition is far-reaching, but the means must be bright, and the purpose must be pure. Because "justice resides in people's hearts," ambition that comes from the right path is worthy of everyone's support and admiration.</p>
<p>Therefore, all young people who have received considerable education should embrace the spirit of "reading to understand the truth," not have selfish and self-serving ambition, but have ambition to benefit the country and the people, otherwise it would be too disappointing to the kindness of the predecessors.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Random Talks on "Hope" <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Da</p>
<p>The scope of hope is extremely broad, and no one can live apart from it, because the elements of everyone's life require it to be sustained.</p>
<p>When a person feels that there is no hope for their future, their will has already declined. Such people are the most dangerous and the most pitiful. Because once the will declines, many tragic consequences, such as frustration and suicide, will inevitably arise. Therefore, especially those who are in the most difficult circumstances, cannot leave hope for a moment. As for why they are unwilling to take their lives lightly, it is precisely because the self-confidence of hope is acting as their backing, so they will have greater courage to continue to survive, and at the same time, this courage contains a large amount of interesting elements. When a person has this kind of joy of living for hope, they can rely on it to fight against the harsh environment; struggle from pain to the road of ideals. Therefore, hope is not only the source of life for everyone, but also a life-saving medicine for the frustrated.</p>
<p>So, how do we explain the two words "hope"? What is "hope"? "Hope" is an ideal in the heart for the outside world or the future, and "hope" is the desire for this ideal to become a "fact." Strictly speaking, the two words "hope" are just empty abstract nouns. Of course, people should not have the mentality of thinking that there is no hope, but they must also understand that hope comes from ideals, and ideals arise from dissatisfaction with the environment. To improve the inadequacy of the environment, one must put his ideal into practice in a down-to-earth manner. The day when the ideal becomes a reality is also the day when one avoids empty hope. If one only has ideals but cannot put them into practice according to the ideal, then this ideal is just a vain dream. However, this dream is different from the dream of a beggar wanting to marry a noble lady. The former is a betrayal of the dream that can be realized but is not realized, while the latter is a fundamentally impossible extravagant dream. However, there are more people like this in society. They understand very well that this is a dream that is not worth dreaming about and cannot be dreamed of, but this dream can also calm their "hysterical" hearts and can temporarily get comfort. Many people are also willing to anesthetize their whole lives in this kind of psychology, because this can reduce a lot of their pain, and therefore they are planning their dreams all day long, and in the dream's mind, reflecting his colorful pictures; a reasonable environment, but sometimes the fact is indeed like this.</p>
<p>Everyone has their own hopes, but the starting point of these hopes is different from person to person. Old people hope to have a good coffin and a quiet cemetery, young children hope that their parents can give them more delicious candies and fun toys, officials hope that their official career will be prosperous, literati hope that their articles can be appreciated, students hope to win the first place, businessmen hope to make three times the profit, poor boys hope to rise rapidly, and sensual people hope to get a wonderful lover, even those who hope to get rich hope to win the first prize in the lottery..."</p>
<p>In short, hope is endless, there are pure and good hopes, there are extravagant hopes with insufficient weight, there are universal desires for food and clothing, and there are even more illusory hopes with many dreams..."</p>
<p>Since the hopes of mankind are so different, the competition in society will also appear more varied. As a result, only the regular hope of the wise can surpass the forefront of all hopes, because this hope is the most vibrant, evolutionary, and the most likely to be realized in ideals.</p>

<p>— Robert</p>
<p>A few days ago, this newspaper published the sixteen-character family motto written by Elder Chongde during his ninetieth birthday celebration, allowing our readers to feast their eyes and also serving as our motto, enjoying lifelong merit, which is indeed immeasurable.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the author went to the residence of Wang Shuzhen, a famous obstetrician in Shanghai, for some business, and saw a horizontal scroll hanging in her living room, signed "Old Man Shunlin". Upon closer inspection, it was also a calligraphy work of Elder Chongde. The brushstrokes were strong and precious. , So I recorded it for the same enthusiasts.</p>
<p>In the upper right corner of the horizontal scroll, there is an oval-shaped yang seal, engraved with three characters, saying "Benevolent Longevity". In the middle, nineteen large characters are written: "Wealth, fame, and achievements are all fleeting glory in the world, but only a broad mind is truly useful." Below, it is written "Rightly recorded from the words of the late Wen Zheng Gong", signed "Written by Old Man Shunlin". There are two seals under the signature: one is a four-character yin text "Nie Zeng Jifen", and the other is a yang text "Written by Elder Chongde after the age of eighty". It can be seen that the old man wrote this after the age of eighty.</p>

<h3 id="e55">In Memory of the Deceased Mother, Chen Yunshang Raises Funds for the Women and Children's Hospital <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Movie star Ms. Chen Yunshang is studious, multi-talented, purely filial and loyal to her friends. Since her mother passed away last year, she has been thinking about the pain of bereavement. She cannot repay the kindness of nurturing her. In order to make up for her regrets, she initiated a fundraising campaign on Parent's Day on May 9th and donated the funds to the Shanghai Civilian Women and Children's Hospital to benefit mothers in general poverty. It is heard that the hospital is located at 995 Kang Nao Tu Road (ie, the special hospital for Shanghai Primary School Teachers), which was founded by Chairman Pan Zhiquan and Dean Wang Yihui. For the past five years, it has been providing free services to civilian mothers and has achieved remarkable results. Ms. Chen, on the occasion of her temporary farewell to the screen, took the initiative to take on this matter and called out, and in just a few days, she had already donated a huge sum of 60,000 yuan. Her righteous act is commendable and admirable. Seeing that she can extend the heart of supporting her parents to the public, and be filial to her own parents, and be filial to the infinite number of parents, her insight is especially admirable. I think there is no shortage of people in the world who share the same sympathy and hidden pain as Ms. Chen, and I sincerely hope that they will hear the news and rise up to participate in this grand event. Donations are welcome regardless of the amount. Please send them to Mr. Yu Zhongkui, the honorary accountant of the hospital, transferred through the Bank of Communications on Jing'an Temple Road, and a formal receipt will be returned.</p>

<p>Dr. Song Guobin wrote a letter saying: "On the third day of the fourth lunar month, it is my wife's fiftieth birthday. Considering the difficulties of the times, it is necessary to be thrifty. We will not invite guests, accept gifts, hold banquets, or kill animals. I am willing to use the saved money to help public welfare. Now I order my children, Enpu, to send a thousand yuan in deposit vouchers, half to help education and half to help the poor."</p>
<p>(Editor's note: Dr. Song is enthusiastic about serving the community, providing voluntary treatment for primary school teachers and the poor and sick, and now he is donating money, which is really rare. The money has been allocated as instructed. Thank you very much.)</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Rongguang wrote a letter of condolence and assistance: "In recent years, many students from poor families have dropped out of school. Promoting charity education seems to be the top priority. I saw in your newspaper the organization of the Private Zhicheng Night Middle School, which aims to cultivate poor and outstanding young people and completely exempts tuition and miscellaneous fees. I secretly sympathize. Recently, I was introduced by a friend and went to the school at 29 Dazhong Lane, Tongfu Road, to visit, and I learned that the school's purpose is indeed pure. Now, in memory of the third anniversary of my late father Pan Aogong, I specially donated 1,000 yuan for the school's expenses." (Note: The school was founded by teachers and friends from various universities and has achieved remarkable results. The money has been transferred to Principal Cao Peishi.)</p>
<p>Receipt Report (1) Relief Fund: Mrs. Song Guobin (funds transferred from the 50th birthday celebration) 500 yuan, Mr. Zhou 100 yuan, Wu Xiaogan 10 yuan, colleagues from the tax office 100 yuan, a total of 710 yuan in deposit vouchers, with a balance of 42,348 yuan and 7 jiao. (2) Medical Aid Fund for Primary School Teachers: Mr. Yoshida Toyu 1,000 yuan, with a balance of 45,929 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<p>Generous Assistance to the Old and Young Yesterday, we received from Mr. Yao Qiyuan, a bonsai artist, the generous donation of 300 yuan each from the Songxiang Xingchang Department Store to the Sacred Heart Nursery and the Shanghai Home for the Aged. (Note: Please ask the treasurers of the two hospitals to collect the money from this office with receipts)</p>
