<h3 id="c1">中國知識階級的騎牆主義 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>（一）人民對於政洽的反響</p>
<p>「布堯治天下五十年，不知天下治歟，不治歟？憶兆願戴己歟，不願戴已歟？問左右不知，問外朝不知，問在野不知。」這是十八史略中的一節，是說：雖如堯帝那樣的英明，要知道民衆對於政治的反響，是怎樣的困難。並說明了具有房氣，敢於率直地把民衆對於政治的反響，傳達於堯帝左右者，是怎樣的稀少。</p>
<p>國府「治夭下三年」，當還都紀念日那天，陳孚木氏在「中國與東亞」雜誌上，曾率直地指出中國民衆對於現政治的反響。這是國府對民衆政治之「眞摯性」的表示，是頗堪注目的一篇文章。</p>
<p>陳先生對「代表輿論」的中日各報僅以恭維的話叙述此問題，深致慨歎。他則「頗留意一般國人的反響，並默察這些反響的結果。」並將所聞於人民的反響，歸納爲如决的五項結論：</p>
<p>（一）「國府有成績也好，沒有成績也好，等待大戰給束後冉說吧，現在來談，還是太早呢。』</p>
<p>（二）「東條首相來華，當然是空前盛舉，但日本首相，也有到過台灣的，也有到過旅順的。」</p>
<p>（三）「撤消治外法權是値得欣慰的，但中國的法庭眞能審判日本人嗎？」</p>
<p>（四）交還物資的統制權是很好的，但波邊顧問曾表示今後各地還要聘請日本經濟專家協助，這樣今後辦事家或許還有些效率呢。」</p>
<p>（五）國府機構雖曾兩度大改革。和若干度調整，重慶政權亦不是經過好幾次的改革和調整？結果豈不是一樣？」</p>
<p>（見「中國與東亞」四月號卷頭論文「國民政府在强化邁進中」）</p>
<p>陳先生在這裏沒有論到這些民衆反響是否正當，但他們的反響，可斷言決不是信口胡說，亦爲事實。筆者想在這裏代陳先生來研究這民衆反響是否正當。但因爲沒有時間對出五項逐一加以分析，僅對於最重要的第一項，即中國人對現實的「騎墻主義」的懷疑論，作一批判。</p>
<p>（二）騎牆主義的存在理由</p>
<p>南京國民政府即使不强化，大局也終必待世界戰爭的結果來決定，在此之前，甚麽也不須做。這種說法，在中國民衆間，尤其在知識階級間，是相當牢固的思想。這在實際上就是暗地裏希望反軸心方面的勝利，所以似乎懈怠了與日本的一切協力。這種態度，的確在上海的所謂「中立份子」的一部中可以見到。站在中國知識階級的立塲，不能一概用狡猾這名詞來非難此種態度。誰也知道中國知識階級自國民革命以來以至於今日，以反帝國主義的民族獨立的精神爲其一貫的思想之基礎。鴉片戰爭以來，受着列强的壓迫，中國首先應如何排除列强的壓迫，以完成民族獨立，乃是當務之急。所以中國的知識階級，在他們的生存中，就負上了這個任務。但在物質文明落後的中國，不能用獨力驅逐帝國主義，於是遂產生了「以夷制夷」的外交政策，軸心方面也好，反軸心方面也好，祗要能够把中國從半殖民地的地位解放出來，無論那一面都好。這在表面上的確是「狡猾」，也是中國在向來所處的國際環境中產生的民族獨立的方法，不得已的「狡猾性」。因此，中國的知識階級，如其以爲軸心方面有滿足中國民族獨立的要求之可能性，則傾向於軸心方面；如其見到反軸心方面有此可能性，則傾向於反軸心方面。世界戰局的一進一退，是左右這種可能性的重大要素之一，所以中國知識階級之現實的行動，被世界戰局的前途所左有，是不容否定的事實。和平區內一部份中國知識階級，不參加南京國民政府，而作爲特殊存在着的「中立份子」，其理由之一部，即由此騎牆主義可獲得說明。</p>
<p>五月九日的大陸新報社論，提出中立份子的問題，力主「國府應把門戶大爲開放，……使經濟人，知識人各得其所。」實是卓見。中國的「知識階級被害於其古典的心理與非建設的性格，常不能越出批評的態度之軌外，而終止於中立份子的立塲」。這說法對中國知識階級的這種根本要求缺乏理解。中國的知識階級決不被害於「古典的心理」與「非建設的性格」，不，很多的中國知識階級，用「近代的心理」與「建設的性格一，在和平區內，同時在「抗戰」地區，參加各種建設事業。所以要使中國知識階級與中國政府合作，一定要打破這騎牆主義的弱點，同時並應答復他們之根本的民族要求。如此，他們始樂於參加政府。</p>
<p>（三）中國知識階級的騎牆主義之缺陷</p>
<p>中國知識階級的騎牆主義之缺陷，在於他們分析世界情勢太過於主觀。試舉例言之，某中立份子曾說，突尼西亞戰綫如在最近吿終，則英美的第二戰綫將立即展開，或許這是對的，亦未可知。但蘇聯與英美的關係，互相利用，同時又互相矛盾，如其英美老早就展開第二戰綫，則蘇聯可獲得休息的時間，而英美則獨自負荷德國之堅强的攻擊；因此，英美儘量設法使蘇聯先展開夏季攻勢，並誘引德國在蘇聯展開夏季攻勢，然後再展開第二戰綫。這樣，可以减輕從德國方面所受的反攻，兼又能防止蘇聯顯著的强化。退一步說，即使英美在極短期間展開第二戰綫，其規模亦決不會大到那裏，他們似乎常想使德國與蘇聯相鬥。</p>
<p>假定第二戰綫的展開成功了，軸心方面敗北了，所及於東亞的影響又如何呢？很多騎牆主義的中國知識階級說，在那時候，英美將用其結合的軍事力。以向日本，日本危險了。但是如其在歐洲方面德義敗北，則蘇聯在歐洲的勢力將大爲擴張，被戰亂所困的歐洲全土，顯然有赤色革命的危險。其影響所及，英美兩國之保守黨的地位自不消說，即勞慟黨亦同感威脅。本年三月二十一日邱吉爾曾說：「擊滅德國之後，舉全部資源，全部軍事力量，遂行對日戰爭」。可是擊滅德國之後，英國忙於應付赤色勢力的彌漫於歐洲，英國到那時候成爲全歐洲的憲兵，是否再有餘力來兼顧遠東，很値得加以深切考慮的。</p>
<p>更進一步說，假使英美蘇解決歐洲之後，再要來解決日本。羅斯福與邱吉爾曾很起勁的討論着「戰後的計劃」。這裏所說的戰後，當然是日德義敗北後的「戰後」，在這樣的「戰後」，蘇聯的東西國境的壓力自然沒有了，因而其勢力不用說就顯著地强大起來。何况各國在戰後勞働問題上所起的不安，前决大戰中已有前車可鑒，當然到那時候英美的勞働問題也大大地惡化起來。日德義的民衆，祗要有機可乘，終歸要與英美爭奪世界覇權的。加以英美的殖民地也將蠭起而要求獨立，這些反英美的要素如其結合起來，英美的支配階級當然也想到不能維持現在的地位。因此，英美的所謂「戰後」者，實在就可以視爲英美的敗北。</p>
<p>這是筆者以日本人的地位所作的主觀的觀察，也正是一部分中國智識階級所想像的，戰後是「太平洋大憲章』的支配時代。以前的戰爭，勝者向敗者提出和平條件，敗者如承認那條件，就恢復和平。他們從這簡單的概念中，想像「太平洋憲章」將是怎樣的東西。可是失敗的國民，決不忘却憎惡與恥辱，祗要這種民族的憎惡與恥辱存在着，戰爭也就存在着。凡爾賽條約並沒有把德國民衆壓制住了，事實上此次大戰不過是前决大戰的延長而已。所以此决的世界戰爭，不會再有這樣牛途而廢的事實出現。所以說「等待大戰結束後冉說吧，現在來談國府的强化問題，還是太早呢」的人們，打算等待到甚麼時候再來談呢？</p>
<p>（四）世界戰爭讓我們來決定</p>
<p>在拿破崙戰爭後，當鮑爾本王朝復活的時候，有所謂法蘭西的亡命貴族者，向鮑爾本王朝要求戰爭中不屈服於革命的酬勞，不過那時候法蘭西國內的社會情勢完全改變了，所以他們的要求大部份不能容納。假使一部份中國的中立份子，也效法法國的亡命貴族，希望不與日本合作的酬勞，那大槪總不好意思罷。當然，在中國知識階級的騎牆主義中，攙入這種利己的動機之成分者少，而出於國家的動機，把民族的運命結合於世界戰局前途者佔多數。現在想把這種民族主義之騎牆主義思想的大謬，指摘出來。</p>
<p>我們東西諸民族在不知不覺中受歐美文化的影響，殊爲遺憾。人們多以爲「現在世界戰爭的重心依然是歐洲戰局』的說法是對的，因此，中國許多知識階級就結論說：「所以世界戰爭決定於歐洲戰塲』，這說法似乎有些論理的越軌。世界戰爭是由於全世界鬥爭勢力之綜合的結果所決定的，決不是被決定於局部的歐洲戰局的結果。而且日本在亞細亞的戰略地位，在像目前的塲合，「世界戰爭被決定於歐洲戰塲』的這種修辭學的表現，並不正確。當中國知識階級說這話的時候，顯然沒有把中國現在在亞洲的力量加入於世界戰爭之決定的要素中。中國雖然走錯了路，但中華民族究竟保持了與冠絕世界的日本陸軍鬥爭六年的傳統，大家都知道在香港，新加坡，馬尼刺的英美軍怎樣不是日軍的對手，望風披靡。日本軍人承認中國軍隊遠較英美軍爲頑强而富於勇氣。在這一點上，中國知識階級對中華民族的力量，不能不稍爲保持一點自信。假使中國與日本合作起來把槍頭指向英美，「世界戰爭決定於亞細亞」並不是難事。世界戰爭並不是「被決定」於他人，實是由我們來「決定」的。</p>
<p>中國知識階級不自覺到亞細亞的力量，（在這點上日本的歐美派亦相同），不知不覺地感染了歐美中心思想的事實，從歷史的看來也並不是沒有理由的。中國也與日本一樣忙於吸集歐美的物質文明，但與日本不同者，這一個國家沒有完成民族革命，民族資本屈服於英美的買辦資本，其結果，在血液上是中國人，而在思想上相近於歐美人的華僑及其許多後代位列爲支配階級，在中國的政治家中，不能寫中國文，用英語寫公文的人們，指不勝屈，如宋子文，宋美齡，孔祥熙之流，不勝枚舉，這種思想上的歐亞雜種兒爲支配者的一部，決不能說是中華民族的名譽。</p>
<p>民族的資本與民族的支配階級，對這種買辦的資本與買辦的支配階級之間，當然不斷的在鬥爭着。這自構成爲重慶政權內部派閥鬥爭的主流之一部。重慶政權內部的這種派閥鬥爭，根本上也是「亞細亞的中國」與「英美的中國」之鬥爭。在中國的內部，不，在全亞細亞的各地，「亞細亞的」與「英美的」各以不同的形態在鬥爭着。日本當然亦不能例外。這許多各地的鬥爭，在世界戰爭的過程中。具有發展爲偉大的「亞細亞」對「英美」的鬥爭之傾向。所以現在中國知識階級拱手以待世界戰爭的吿終，是因爲看不到這種鬥爭的緣故。</p>
<p>（五）結論</p>
<p>自覺的中國知識階級，漸漸的淸算騎牆主義，對「亞細亞」的英美，開始鬥爭了。他們正在檢討，現在的南京國民政府是否可算得中國的這種鬥爭的中心。陳孚木氏在這裏大胆的提出了中國人所發生的疑問：「東條首相來華，當然是空前盛舉，但日本首相也有到過台灣的，也有到過旅順的。」這質問以中國禮儀方式言之，似有其片面理由，但其內容恐怕對南京國民政府有些失禮。不過中國的知識階級向南京國民政府提出這失禮的質問，未必出於惡意。似上所述，在中國的知識階級之閒，自覺到在這世界情勢中，不能不用自身的力量有所作爲。他們懇摯地請問南京國民政府能否成爲在中國的亞細亞解放鬥爭的主體。對此問題作具體的答覆者，不能小是南京國民政府民能否使他們騎牆主義的中立份子充分了解，能否把他們吸集於南京國民政府之下，南京國民政府本身的地位賴以決定，　重慶方面的「亞納亞的中國一的指導者們，能否與南京政府合流的大問題，不用說也　由此決定。（翔譯）</p>

<p>柏林十四日中央社電德國新聞社駐東綫軍事特派員哈瑪上校本日稱，東綫氣候，雖已轉佳，但庫班橋頭堡全部地區，星期四僅有小規模之戰鬥活動，蘇軍以弱小之部隊，在各處地方作小規模之進攻，但尙未進入德羅軍之前方陣地，即遭擊退，但預期蘇軍在最近之將來，將復作大規模之攻擊，此觀於其在展佈地區內之大規模運輸活動，及其重兵器之增加，即可爲明證。但德羅軍對此一着，亦已有必要之準備。現時除里西羌克西北之地區，經雙方熱烈爭奪，已歷數日外，東綫全部之其他地區，並無任何重要活動。蘇軍使用重武器，並以坦克車協助，冀圖奪取德軍擲彈兵所防守之唐納資高地數處，隨即發生劇烈戰鬥，並常發展爲肉博戰，德軍率能保守其陣地，並將全綫各處蘇軍部隊擊退，至將近黃昏時，敵軍已被迫退至原來陣地。德國新聞社空軍特派員費萊達少校稱，德空軍於星期四，集中導向庫班下游地區及唐納資作戰地區，攻擊轟炸機及俯衝轟炸機，向蘇方之運輸砲位機塲及鐵道猛烈攻擊，結果使敵軍後方之設備受事大之破壞。德戰鬥機常結隊掩獲德軍，完全成功，蘇空軍在上星期所受損失，現時仍有餘痛，故於星期四，僅以小隊之戰鬥機及戰鬥轟炸機在庫班地區作戰，在該地區之空戰中，德戰鬥機將敵機於三十架中擊落十八架，尙有蘇機五架，爲高射砲擊落。</p>

<p>東京十五日中央社電日大本營海軍報道部員田代格中佐，曾於四月中旬視察以所羅鬥羣島爲中心之前綫各地，甫於日前返國，十四日下午七時半，在東京電臺廣播演說，題爲「從前綫歸來」，其大旨如次，日軍占領地之全部，包括緬甸各地域中部太平洋及阿留申方面以上各地，悉爲決戰塲所，現並已到決戰時機，予此次巡視所羅門羣島前綫，於最近返京，目擊該地將兵，士氣極爲旺盛，均抱必勝信念，我人對於此次作戰，其大意明分，昭然若揭，開戰以來，迅即將敵之根據地及要衝奪取，鞏固作戰基地，我軍即乘機展開攻勢，在南太平洋方面，由新幾內亞而抵達所羅門一綫，已將敵軍制壓且在「陸海一體」之作戰上，發揮巧妙戰略，戰無不勝。予此次抵某某基地，時正深宵，突然空襲警報大嗚，即躍起往指定塲所探視，見我軍司令官與幕僚，正在窺察敵機之動靜，其一舉一動，鎭定沉着，不禁使予勇氣倍增，確信「此次戰爭絕能勝利」。又在前綫敢令予感動者，厥爲日陸海軍部隊兩者協力之聚密，實無隙可乘。茲舉例以言，加海軍方面之糧食，全賴陸軍部隊之接濟，不虞有缺，此蓋出於陸軍方面之熱忱，反之海軍部隊亦深謝陸軍在基地從事奮戰，使海軍無後顧之據云。其次我將士苦鬬之精神，該地區係惡劣瘴癘之鄉，我軍一方與頭敵作戰，一方又須與瘧病苦鬬，美國曾稱「此密林地必爲人類作戰最劣之戰塲」，良有以也。據聞美兵之斃於瘧疾者，較斃於彈下者，多至五倍云。當美國發表，駐守瓜達爾卡納爾島之美海軍，在此一日中間，與陸海部隊換防時，此批海軍部隊，因日軍之猛攻與瘧疾爲患，殆已所存無幾矣，日軍方面則因防疫班之活動，罹病者較少，此則深感防疫戰士之爲鬬功績也。要之前綫日陸海軍之一體作戰，其忠毅精神，堪爲我人所深感不忘也</p>

<p>— 德富豬一郎</p>
<p>（四）政黨亡國</p>
<p>在英國衰亡的許多原因中，一個主要的原因，是英國政黨的政治碰壁。英國是政黨政治的發祥地，世上謳歌政黨政治的，都以英國爲其靈廟。如同耶穌敎徒的耶路撒冷，佛敎徒的菩陀伽耶（Buddha-gaya），回敎徒的麥加，儒敎徒的曲阜一般，在政黨政治家看來，韋斯明斯忒的英國議院，是神聖的政黨政治的本殿。如果把這政黨政治看做是導致英國趨於滅亡之途的禍根，不是要使他們出於意外地失驚嗎？原來英國的政黨，並不是故意地製造出來的，並目與其說是出於自然，毋寗說是出於偶然的一宗東西。在斯丟阿特朝的時候，議院也並不是常設的，有時竟至政府和人民都像把議會的存在忘掉了似的。當時的國王，對於議院的開設和財政上的掙扎，着實煞費了一番苦心，人民也却很像心滿意足似的。到了次代斯丢阿特朝議院常常開設起來，可是越是開設起來，反對的氣氛，越是一回一回愈益猛烈起來，由是發生出王黨和民黨的差別來，詹姆士一世是個哲學家，也是個神學家；其爲學者，是有着像鄉下大學敎授那樣的學識，並且還有著作。然而他却沒有懂得治國平天下的道理。當時品評他爲「最賢慧的大阿木林」，眞是一點不錯。</p>
<p>其後到了查理士一世，戰爭就此爆發起來。民黨因爲是頭髮短的，所以有「短髮黨」的渾名；王黨因爲多騎馬的武士，所以也叫做「騎馬黨」。到了查理士二世，雖然恢筏了王黨的天下；可是到了詹姆士二世，又因爲要回復那在亨利八世時候曾一度被排斥掉的羅馬舊敎，向着人民作信敎上的無理强迫，攪七念三，終至於被驅逐掉。新由反對黨迎　王位的，便是那個荷蘭的俄楞治公威廉和他的妃子瑪麗。</p>
<p>此後，又成爲灰格黨（自由黨的前身）隆盛的世界，托利黨（保守黨的前身）差不多消聲潛影，到了下代女王「安」的時候，兩黨又呈着對立的狀態。女王安之後，從漢諾威迎來的國王喬治，在即位的時候，已經五十多歲了。他全然不懂得英語，雖然從來的閣錢，必定由國王親臨裁奪的，可是因爲這新來的國王不懂得英語的緣故，即使列席閣議，也如同木偶般沒有用處，所以就把親臨內開會議這件事作罷了下來。英國的責任內閣制，就這樣淵源於從異國迎來的國王的不懂英語。如果說是偶然，恐怕再沒有像這樣的偶然的吧</p>
<p>如上所述，國王　　於閣議之外的英國內閣，理所當然，對於議院必須負其責任，大臣對於議院的責任，同時大臣相互間的連帶責任，就是這樣成立的。世間雖有「國王君臨而不統治」的話，不過其成爲一句慣用語，還是後來的事。</p>
<p>這樣，灰格黨以非常的勢力，掌握政權。到了喬治三世，才生在英國，懂得英語，方才有了生長於英國的國王。他想恢復王楠，要親自親政，終於沒有成功，而　志以逝。此後就是維多利亞朝時代，灰格黨變成自由黨，托利黨變成保守黨，愛爾蘭自治問題以後，從自由黨分出的統一派與保守黨合流，而保守黨全體竟稱爲統一黨。</p>
<p>愛爾蘭問題解決後，保守黨仍恢復其本來面目，迄第一决世界大戰後，勞慟黨的勃典，產生了勞働黨內閣，如此，自由黨遂在英國政治上陷於無足輕重的她位，自由黨與保守黨的對立也成爲過去的夢境，至於今日，所存在的不過是名義上的政黨政治而已。所以今日英國的政黨政治徒有其名，所謂依其政見而組成黨派，在實際政治上貫澈其主張，主義，完全是過去的陳跡了，</p>
<p>英國的政權，在理論上是從上而下，其政權的分配，從國王至貴族，從貴族至中流階級，從中流階級以至一般民衆。然而在實際上，依然存在於一百家左右貴族或富豪們的手中。他們的意志，蒙上了政黨政治的假面具　順地而圓滑地施行着。總之，英國的民主主義，與其說是民衆的民主主義，不如說是假民主主義之名，行民主主義之　。英國把征服諾曼以來的封　制度，維持至於今日，而在封建制度上用新的輸血來補充。</p>
<p>蒲拉特在維多利亞朝中期曾說：「土地的所有者就是政權的所有者」，在目前，其土地的所有者，自一九二〇年迄一九二七年的七年間，一半以上的英國土地的所有者業已變易了。這些人們就是貴族制度的輸血者。</p>
<p>這些輸血者是猶太人，或與猶太人有極密切關係的大資本主義之成功者。他們實際上可以任意支配議會。英國的老記者羅氏曾列舉事實詳論英國的政治稱：</p>
<p>英國的政權，是被稱爲一部份所謂交際社會的階級占有着。如其不容於交際社會者，不論其有多大的才幹，不能做閣僚。</p>
<p>現在勞働黨的勢力勃興，這情形未必依然如故，然而主要勢力，依然存在於貴挨，豪富之手。例如在某一個時代，英國有塞西爾（Cehil）族者共一家中的父，姪，及二子數人，均占內閣中的要職，當時世間會稱內閣爲塞西爾族的旅館會社。因爲在內閣中其親族竟占五人之多。</p>
<p>又當張伯倫一家有勢力的時候，英國的「笨拙」雜誌（Punch），曾揭載諷刺畫一幅，題爲「帝國的膨脹，增加張伯倫家的包工工作」。這因爲張伯倫一家是伯明罕地方各種軍需品製造會社的大股東，該會社的有力部分，是張伯倫一族，及其關係者所有，或爲其所支配。</p>
<p>一九四〇年出版了一木題爲：「支配大英帝國的百家』的書籍。依此書看來，英國的貴族，富豪，與政黨沒有顯著的差別，互相結托，覇持政權，以逞其私慾。書中所述，雖不盡可信，但大概不至於差到那裏。（翔·丁：譯自五月一日東部每日新聞）</p>

<p>中華電影聯合股份有限公司業於前（十四）日舉行降重成立大會，昨（十五）日下午三時，假座江西路都城飯店特爲公司成立舉行招待新聞界茶會，濟濟一堂，情緒熱烈。</p>
<p>主席致詞　首由該公司常務董事兼總經理馮節氏主席致詞稱：「中華電影聯合股份有限公司由原有中華中聯上影三公司合併結成，已於五月一日開始，隔昨十四日正式鄭重披露，與社會各界人士相見。本公司具深厚之根基，非憑空草創，其生命寄托於社會各界愛護本公司人士之手，寄托於政府之手，寄托於中日滿三國官民之手，前途之發展，自無疑慮。本公司同人當仰體締造艱難，與熱心人士期待之至意，一心一德，實事求是，爲中國電影界，爲社會人士，爲整個大東亞努力以赴。今後方針，務求完成爲一件現代化文事業，其所表現，以能適應大時代要求，而尤以提高「幹」的精神，期與一般事業猛向前進。當前局面，整個中國，整個東亞，在艱苦掙扎中，「幹」則生存，不「幹」則毀滅，實義無反顧也。本人奉政府命，來滬服務宣傳行政一年有餘，仰荷中樞督導，友邦官民協助，社會各界人士愛護，進行甚感順利，至堪感激，此後允望更加援助。」</p>
<p>組織報告　繼由副總理張善琨報告該公司合併成立經過，略謂：『本公司爲適應戰時文化宣傳體制，而由中華電影公司中華聯合製片公司及上海影院公司合併成立，製片發行影院三部，由是打成一片，兄弟忝任製片部經理，因就今後之製片方針，簡略報吿。過去中聯之初期製片，稍着重於營利，在意識上有所忽略，自然難免，惟後期製片，不以利潤爲目的，多有敎育文化成份，在意識上頗爲純正，如最近出品之「萬世流芳」，已辱荷新聞界獎譽，今後本公司製片方針，當循正軌而努力，但公司同人，智力有限，尙希新聞界繼續不斷，予以嚴正指導」。次由副總經理石川俊重報吿組織現狀稱：『本公司內部共分五部，製片部已由張副經理報吿如上，總務部即與普通公司無異，係管理總務及會計等事宜。發行部不僅發行本公司之影片，同時注重電影交流，一方面將本公司影片遍運東亞各地，另一方面則發行日滿之影片。戲院部乃管理影戲院之經營問題，目前在上海由公司直接管理有二十家，華南及其他各地亦有十五家之多。今後對戲院之經營，將有更大之擴充。巡迴放映部爲適應中國電影院之未普遍而設立，在各鄉未有影院，巡迥放映甚爲重要，但困難頗多，惟仍繼續努力，完成使命。此外，尙有設計委員會之組織，其任務不限一方面，實爲對各部發展而設計，並爲總經理之諮訽機關。電影硏究所專從事研究電影技術等問題，及調查電影事業之發展動態等。同時各地設有分公司，如南京，漢口，廣州，東京，等分公司，均爲適應新階段而設立。』</p>
<p>本報提議　最後由本報陳社長提議，願以本報之「自由談」篇幅，每週一次，作爲電影之宣傳園地，聊作慶賀中華電影聯合公司成立之禮物，馮總經理接受之餘，並表謝意。至五時，各進茶點而散。</p>
<p>馮氏略歷　此次中華電影聯合公司成立，常務董事及總經理由宣傳部駐滬辦事處長馮節兼任，各方深慶得人，查馮氏係中央候補執行委員，兼宣傳部副部長，國民政府特派新國民運動促進委員會委員。於去年二月來滬，兼任國府宣傳部駐滬辦事處處長，聞馮氏今後致力電影事業，宣傳部駐滬辦事處將因事實關係，祇爲代表宣傳部在滬指抓監督所屬機關及聯絡之機構，所有事務分由各附屬機關執行，處長名義，仍由馮氏兼任，又聞該處將一併遷往漢彌登大樓。</p>

<p>最近各業同業公會，分別改組，將次就緒。整齊陣容，刷新辦法，　屬目前甚好之現象，惟尙有許多表現之事實，仍不能令人遽抱樂觀，不得不率直言之。</p>
<p>（一）同業間互相爭攘。往往同一公會，某甲認爲組織在先，某乙又聲言早經接洽，及至發表籌備人之後，向隅者往往另生枝節，而主持者又跡近排斥，因之頗多爭端，使當局者感覺困難。</p>
<p>（二）組織之先，往往各存一私人權利之觀念，不肯開誠布公，延納本業負有聲望之商人共同參加，甚至視公會爲私人機關，僅便少數人之利益、置大衆福利於不顧。</p>
<p>（三）所用之人，不甚抉擇，容一二僉王敗類混跡其中，難免假公濟私，致遭同業之物議，不免影響於團體之威信。</p>
<p>須知辦公會，是爲公，不是爲私；是利便多數人，不是利便少數人：是絕對公開的事業，不是曖昧營私的勾當。一切要有大公無我之精神，延納同業之輿論，事事應爲國家社會大體上着想，不當爲個人利權上着想，並當博訪周絡，力爲同業解除困難；凡一切妨害國家社會及公衆之事，允當揭力革除，不徇私，不舞弊，不容納敗類，不任用非人，夫而後同業公會之聲譽，方可以保持弗失，方始足以助成商統會艱巨之任務。</p>
<h3 id="c41">商工會議所　新設三委員　網羅軍政民間巨擘參加 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>自日本對華推行新經濟政策以來，在滬日藉經濟界頗各影響，商工會議所對此問題，曾加檢討，業已決定羅納軍政民間有力份子，組織日華問顧委員會。經濟上海建設委員會，日商對策委員會，業經十四日之大會通過，新設之三委員會，與該會議所內旣存之既存之金融，運輸，工業，交易，商業五部會採取密切聯絡，樹立綜合施策系統，此爲其最大目的。</p>
<p>職是之故，從此可一掃已往各部門單獨硏究，檢討對策之弊病，今後一切問題，能綜合歸納而就合法立塲考慮，樹立對策，預定在每次舉行委員會時，愼重硏討具體對策，又爲從廣汎立塲檢討各種問題起見，故在各委員會之下再設立小組委員會，敦請軍政民間名人參加，得隨必要而在南京，東京設立小組委員會，從此日本與上海相互呼應，從側面協力推進對華政策與新經濟政策，同時貢獻於在滬日籍經濟界之發展。</p>
<p>關於三種委員會之運用，定於十九日舉行首次聯度會議時，由商工會議所靑木主席加以說明。同時就委員中推聘各委員會之委昌長，幹事長由會議所專務理事武內文彬氏担任，幹事則就委員及事務局中選任。屆時並有大使館方面田尻公使及岡崎總務課長，奧田經濟部長與大使館經濟部各課長，領事館經濟部田中課長等列席。三委員會設立目的如下：</p>
<p>日華問題委員會</p>
<p>因外交政策之轉換，各種甲日關係，皆有變化，但對於外交政策之轉換旨趣，尙欠透澈，中日兩方之解釋不同，則難期達到政策之目的，故擬交換各種情報，檢討對策，以協力進行，使經濟上，政治上之中日關係恢復本來面目爲目的。</p>
<p>經濟上海建設委員會</p>
<p>因今次新經濟政策之推進，復興中國經濟，爲最重大之問題，因之，號稱華中經濟大本營之上海經濟的復興，不得不加意注視，經濟上海之建設的成功與否，即爲左右中國經濟復興之重大問題，就各種方面檢討復興生產，物價對策，物資移動，金融通貨等項間題，以硏究樹立對策爲目的。</p>
<p>日商對策委員會</p>
<p>因强力推進新經濟政策之關係，預料日商組合商號，亦有相當變動，同時一般識者均主張整理合併組合，以及改業問題，故此委員會以樹立對策爲中心，確保日本經濟力爲目的。</p>

<p>中日合組之物資調查委員會，工部局方面參加該委員會者爲五島副總監與稻　物資統制局長，頃承稻垣氏發表談話如次：本人關於此事，尙未正式聽得若何意向，僅在報上閱知委命，故具體情形，不甚明瞭，工部局對於國民政府之施策，必然全面協力，此點已毋庸贅述，工部局亦準備根據國府最高國防會議之決定，傾其能力，澈查囤積。現在上海之囤積，當然爲金融界人所爲，但生產業者及批發商之居奇，亦含有囤積性質，希望整頓配給機構，同時國府發動處理囤積物資之斷然措置，澈查不能以調查了事，必須根據調查，着重於處理囤積辦法。（雲鵬：譯自五月十五日大陸新報）</p>
<h3 id="c46">各界對於設置　物資調查委員會之反響 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>爲處理囤積問題，業經十三日之最高國防會議通過設立物資調查委員會，由中日雙方聯合組織，各界對此，極表關心，租界內之反響大體如次：</p>
<p>（一）首次澈查竣事後，民間一致希望續派二次澈查大員，今能設立中日合作之恒久澈查機關，爲促進消除囤積計，實深可喜，在撤廢治外法權，實施新經濟政策之現階段上，有此中日共同之委員會設立，此舉實出於日方協助國府之熱忱所致，租界各界一致重視日方之協力事實，對其前途抱極大期待。</p>
<p>（二）首次澈查後，黑市之批價，忽上忽落，四月份平均無漲勢，但拋出之囤貨，仍未流入市上，不過甲方囤戶吐出，乙方囤戶扒進而巳，對於零售物價，無絲毫關係，故囤積問題與物價問題，尙待於今後解決，希望能由此次新設之委員會予以適當解決。</p>
<p>（三）在實施調查囤積物資時，希望當局充分檢討囤積之實情，採取現實之施策，例如大囤戶之囤積方法極爲巧妙，將其物資化整爲零，委託其有關商號與親友等辦理，以期掩人耳目，而策安全，非同業公會會員之囤戶，則委託同業公會會員，託名登記，實則與貨主之原名不符，而且所有登記物資，表面上遵照限價出售，而事實則不然，大多在黑市中進出，而黑市之外，更有所謂黑黑市者存在，按一般之黑市，已占有相仿於公定黑市之地位，在此公定黑市中再有黑市，遂有所謂黑黑市出現。囤積方法，旣如此繁複，在澈查之時願當局充分考慮此點。</p>
<p>（三）在物資調查委員會中，並有代表總司令部，大使館，憲兵隊，工部局等之日方軍政界要員參加，此即爲人民對於該委員會抱有期待之原因，同時首决澈查以來，頗見活潑之民間輿情，對於今後之調查，必然亦抱關切，亟盼能實現中日軍政民之協力體制，確立接受民間善意批評之機構，在官方已有囤積治罪條例，主要商品登記規則，物資調查委員會等之恒久法令與組織，更盼從速設立能作有計劃協助之民間恒久組織，例如物價問題硏究會等等，俾得隨時向物資調查委員會提供意見，官民取得一致，以解決囤積問題，實爲當務之急。（雲鵬：譯自五月十五日大陸新報）</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Middle-of-the-Road Stance of the Chinese Intellectual Class <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Yoshida Tosuke</p>
<p>(I) The People's Reaction to Politics</p>
<p>"Bu Yao ruled the world for fifty years. Did he know whether the world was well-governed or not? Did he know whether the people willingly supported him or not? He asked those around him, but they did not know. He asked those at court, but they did not know. He asked those in the wilderness, but they did not know." This is a section from the "Eighteen Histories Abridged," which says that even for an enlightened emperor like Yao, it was difficult to know the people's reaction to politics. It also illustrates how rare it was to find someone with the courage to directly convey the people's reaction to politics to those around Emperor Yao.</p>
<p>The National Government has been "ruling the world for three years." On the anniversary of the return to the capital, Mr. Chen Fumu, in the magazine "China and East Asia," frankly pointed out the Chinese people's reaction to current politics. This is an expression of the National Government's "sincerity" towards the people's politics and is a noteworthy article.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen expressed deep regret that he only used complimentary words to describe this issue in various Chinese and Japanese newspapers that "represent public opinion." He "paid close attention to the reactions of ordinary Chinese people and silently observed the results of these reactions." He summarized the reactions he heard from the people into the following five conclusions:</p>
<p>(1) "Whether the National Government has achievements or not, let's wait until after the war is over before we talk about it. It's too early to talk about it now."</p>
<p>(2) "Prime Minister Tojo's visit to China is certainly an unprecedented event, but Japanese prime ministers have also visited Taiwan and Lushun."</p>
<p>(3) "The abolition of extraterritoriality is gratifying, but can Chinese courts really try Japanese people?"</p>
<p>(4) "The return of control over materials is good, but Advisor Bonabe has stated that local areas will still hire Japanese economic experts to assist in the future. Perhaps things will be more efficient with their help."</p>
<p>(5) "The National Government's institutions have undergone major reforms twice and adjustments several times. Wasn't the Chongqing regime also reformed and adjusted several times? Weren't the results the same?"</p>
<p>(See Mr. Chen's leading article, "The National Government is Moving Towards Strengthening," in the April issue of "China and East Asia.")</p>
<p>Mr. Chen does not discuss whether these popular reactions are justified, but their reactions, it can be asserted, are definitely not nonsense and are factual. I would like to research whether these popular reactions are justified on behalf of Mr. Chen. But because I do not have time to analyze each of the five items one by one, I will only make a critique of the most important first item, that is, the Chinese people's suspicion of the "middle-of-the-road" position toward reality.</p>
<p>(II) The Reason for the Existence of the Middle-of-the-Road Stance</p>
<p>Even if the Nanjing National Government does not strengthen itself, the overall situation will ultimately be determined by the outcome of the world war, and there is no need to do anything before then. This view is a fairly firm idea among the Chinese people, especially among the intellectual class. In practice, this is a covert hope for the victory of the anti-Axis side, so it seems that all cooperation with Japan is being neglected. This attitude can indeed be seen in some of the so-called "neutral elements" in Shanghai. Standing in the position of the Chinese intellectual class, this attitude cannot be condemned with the term "cunning." Everyone knows that the Chinese intellectual class, since the National Revolution until today, has taken the spirit of anti-imperialist national independence as its consistent ideological foundation. Since the Opium War, under the oppression of the great powers, China's first priority should be to eliminate the oppression of the great powers to achieve national independence. Therefore, the Chinese intellectual class has shouldered this task in their existence. However, in China, where material civilization is backward, it is impossible to expel imperialism independently, so the diplomatic policy of "using barbarians to control barbarians" was created. Whether it is the Axis side or the anti-Axis side, as long as it can liberate China from its semi-colonial status, either side is fine. On the surface, this is indeed "cunning," and it is also an inevitable "cunningness" that arises from China's national independence methods in the international environment it has always been in. Therefore, the Chinese intellectual class tends to the Axis side if it believes that the Axis side has the possibility of satisfying China's national independence demands; if it sees that the anti-Axis side has this possibility, it tends to the anti-Axis side. The advance and retreat of the world war situation is one of the major factors that influences this possibility, so it is an undeniable fact that the Chinese intellectual class's realistic actions are influenced by the future of the world war situation. The reason why a part of the Chinese intellectual class in the peaceful areas does not participate in the Nanjing National Government and exists as "neutral elements" can be explained in part by this middle-of-the-road stance.</p>
<p>The May 9th editorial of the Mainland News raised the issue of neutral elements and strongly advocated that "the National Government should open its doors widely... so that economists and intellectuals can each find their place." This is a brilliant view. The statement that the Chinese "intellectual class is harmed by its classical mentality and non-constructive character, and often cannot go beyond the attitude of criticism and ends up in the position of neutral elements" lacks understanding of this fundamental requirement of the Chinese intellectual class. The Chinese intellectual class is by no means harmed by "classical mentality" and "non-constructive character." No, many Chinese intellectuals, with "modern mentality" and "constructive character," are participating in various construction projects in the peaceful areas and in the "anti-Japanese war" areas at the same time. Therefore, in order to make the Chinese intellectual class cooperate with the Chinese government, it is necessary to break down this weakness of the middle-of-the-road stance and at the same time respond to their fundamental national demands. In this way, they will be happy to participate in the government.</p>
<p>(III) The Defects of the Chinese Intellectual Class's Middle-of-the-Road Stance</p>
<p>The defect of the Chinese intellectual class's middle-of-the-road stance lies in their overly subjective analysis of the world situation. For example, a certain neutral element once said that if the Tunisian front ends soon, the Anglo-American second front will be launched immediately, which may be correct, or it may not be known. However, the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States is one of mutual utilization and mutual contradiction. If the United States and Britain had launched the second front long ago, the Soviet Union could have had time to rest, while the United States and Britain would have borne the brunt of Germany's strong attacks alone; therefore, the United States and Britain are trying their best to get the Soviet Union to launch a summer offensive first, and lure Germany to launch a summer offensive in the Soviet Union, and then launch a second front. In this way, it can reduce the counterattack from Germany and prevent the Soviet Union from being significantly strengthened. To go a step further, even if the United States and Britain launch a second front in a very short period of time, its scale will definitely not be that large. They always seem to want Germany and the Soviet Union to fight each other.</p>
<p>Assuming that the launch of the second front is successful and the Axis side is defeated, what will be the impact on East Asia? Many middle-of-the-road Chinese intellectuals say that at that time, the United States and Britain will use their combined military force to attack Japan, and Japan will be in danger. However, if Germany and Italy are defeated in Europe, the Soviet Union's power in Europe will greatly expand, and the entire European continent, which is困ed by war, will obviously be in danger of a communist revolution. The impact of this will threaten not only the position of the Conservative Party in the United States and Britain, but also the Labor Party. On March 21 of this year, Churchill said: "After destroying Germany, we will use all our resources and all our military power to wage war against Japan." However, after destroying Germany, Britain will be busy dealing with the spread of communist forces in Europe. At that time, Britain will become the police of all of Europe. Whether it will have the extra energy to take care of the Far East is worth considering deeply.</p>
<p>Going a step further, assuming that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union solve Europe and then come to solve Japan. Roosevelt and Churchill have been discussing "post-war plans" with great enthusiasm. The post-war mentioned here is of course the "post-war" after the defeat of Japan, Germany, and Italy. In such a "post-war," the Soviet Union's pressure on its eastern and western borders will naturally disappear, so its power will undoubtedly become significantly stronger. Moreover, the unrest caused by labor issues in various countries after the war is something that can be learned from the previous war. Of course, the labor problems in the United States and Britain will also greatly deteriorate at that time. The people of Japan, Germany, and Italy will eventually compete with the United States and Britain for world hegemony as long as they have the opportunity. In addition, the colonies of the United States and Britain will also rise up and demand independence. If these anti-British and American elements combine, the ruling classes of the United States and Britain will certainly think that they cannot maintain their current position. Therefore, the so-called "post-war" of the United States and Britain can really be regarded as the defeat of the United States and Britain.</p>
<p>This is a subjective observation made by the author from the position of a Japanese, and it is also what some Chinese intellectuals imagine. The post-war era is the era of "Pacific Charter" rule. In previous wars, the victor proposed peace terms to the loser, and if the loser accepted those terms, peace was restored. From this simple concept, they imagine what the "Pacific Charter" will be like. However, the defeated people will never forget hatred and shame. As long as this national hatred and shame exist, the war will also exist. The Treaty of Versailles did not suppress the German people. In fact, this war is just an extension of the previous war. Therefore, this world war will not have such a half-hearted ending. So, when will the people who say "Let's wait until the war is over before we talk about it. It's too early to talk about strengthening the National Government now" plan to wait until?</p>
<p>(IV) Let Us Decide the World War</p>
<p>After the Napoleonic Wars, when the Bourbon dynasty was restored, there were so-called French émigré nobles who asked the Bourbon dynasty for rewards for not surrendering to the revolution during the war, but at that time the social situation in France had completely changed, so most of their requests could not be accommodated. If some of China's neutral elements also follow the example of the French émigré nobles and hope for rewards for not cooperating with Japan, then it would probably be too embarrassing. Of course, in the middle-of-the-road stance of the Chinese intellectual class, there are few people who mix in such selfish motives, and most of them are motivated by the country and combine the fate of the nation with the future of the world war. Now I want to point out the great fallacy of this nationalistic middle-of-the-road thinking.</p>
<p>It is a pity that we East and West peoples have been unconsciously influenced by European and American culture. Many people think that the saying "The focus of the current world war is still the European war situation" is correct. Therefore, many Chinese intellectuals concluded that "The world war is determined by the European battlefield." This statement seems to have some logical deviations. The world war is determined by the comprehensive result of the fighting forces of the whole world, and is definitely not determined by the result of the local European war situation. Moreover, Japan's strategic position in Asia, in a situation like the present, the rhetorical expression that "the world war is determined by the European battlefield" is not correct. When Chinese intellectuals say this, they clearly do not add China's current power in Asia to the factors that determine the world war. Although China has gone down the wrong path, the Chinese nation has after all maintained the tradition of fighting the world's best Japanese army for six years. Everyone knows how the British and American troops in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Manila were no match for the Japanese army and collapsed at the first sign of trouble. Japanese soldiers admit that the Chinese army is much more tenacious and courageous than the British and American armies. On this point, the Chinese intellectual class cannot but maintain a little self-confidence in the power of the Chinese nation. If China and Japan cooperate and point their guns at the United States and Britain, it is not difficult to say that "the world war is determined by Asia." The world war is not "determined" by others, but "determined" by us.</p>
<p>The Chinese intellectual class is not aware of the power of Asia (on this point, the Japanese pro-Western faction is also the same), and the fact that it has unconsciously been infected with European and American centralism is not without reason from a historical point of view. China, like Japan, is busy absorbing European and American material civilization, but unlike Japan, this country has not completed the national revolution, and national capital has succumbed to British and American comprador capital. As a result, the Chinese in blood, and the overseas Chinese whose thoughts are close to Europeans and Americans and their many descendants are ranked as the ruling class. Among Chinese politicians, there are countless people who cannot write Chinese and write official documents in English, such as Soong Tzu-wen, Soong Mei-ling, and Kung Hsiang-hsi. It cannot be said that such Eurasian hybrids in thought are the honor of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>National capital and the national ruling class are, of course, constantly fighting against this comprador capital and comprador ruling class. This constitutes a major part of the factional struggle within the Chongqing regime. The factional struggle within the Chongqing regime is fundamentally a struggle between "Asian China" and "British-American China." Within China, no, in all parts of Asia, "Asian" and "British-American" are fighting in different forms. Of course, Japan is no exception. These many local struggles, in the process of the world war, have a tendency to develop into a great struggle of "Asia" against "Britain and America." Therefore, the reason why the Chinese intellectual class is waiting for the end of the world war with their hands tied is because they do not see this struggle.</p>
<p>(V) Conclusion</p>
<p>The conscious Chinese intellectual class is gradually liquidating its middle-of-the-road stance and starting to fight the "British-American" in "Asia." They are reviewing whether the current Nanjing National Government can be regarded as the center of this struggle in China. Mr. Chen Fumu boldly raised a question that Chinese people have: "Prime Minister Tojo's visit to China is certainly an unprecedented event, but Japanese prime ministers have also visited Taiwan and Lushun." This question, spoken in the Chinese etiquette style, seems to have its one-sided reasons, but its content is probably somewhat disrespectful to the Nanjing National Government. However, the Chinese intellectual class's disrespectful question to the Nanjing National Government may not be out of malice. As mentioned above, among the Chinese intellectual class, there is an awareness that in this world situation, they must use their own strength to do something. They earnestly ask whether the Nanjing National Government can become the subject of the Asian liberation struggle in China. Whether those who make a concrete response to this question can fully understand the neutral elements of the Nanjing National Government, and whether they can absorb them into the Nanjing National Government, depends on the position of the Nanjing National Government itself. The major question of whether the leaders of "Asian China" in Chongqing can merge with the Nanjing government goes without saying that it will also be determined by this. (Translated by Xiang)</p>

<h3 id="e2">Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani Masayuki, Convened Staff in Nanjing for Instructions, Encouraging the Promotion of New Policies Towards China and the Completion of the War. He Will Present His Credentials Tomorrow and Convene a Meeting of Ministers. <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Tani Masayuki, the newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to China, convened Mr. Horiuchi and Mr. Nakamura, ministers, as well as all embassy staff, military and naval personnel, and economic advisors at his official residence at 10:00 this morning, after arriving at his post on the 14th, to give instructions. The main points were that at this critical time for the rise and fall of the nation, the tasks of the Greater East Asia Ministry's overseas local agencies have become increasingly important. My task is also to complete the Greater East Asia War and to thoroughly promote the new policies towards China. Since the implementation of the new policies towards China at the end of last year, the National Government's strengthening of politics, revival of the economy, and stabilization of people's livelihoods have gradually been realized. This is also our country's national policy, that is, to cooperate and work together with China to complete the Greater East Asia War. If China and Japan cannot achieve true coexistence and co-prosperity, this great goal cannot be achieved. Therefore, we must thoroughly strive for the coexistence and co-prosperity of China and Japan in the future. From our country's perspective of solving the China-Japan issue as the foundation for establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, we have determined to eliminate any obstacles that hinder the resolution of the China-Japan issue. Moreover, in view of today's world situation, the resolution of the China-Japan issue cannot be neglected in the slightest. Therefore, I have decided to overcome all difficulties together with you and do my best to achieve this important mission. I hope that you will also stand on the front line, work together in harmony, grasp the overall situation, and move forward.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - Since Ambassador Tani's arrival, it is generally believed that Japan's policies towards China will be actively promoted, and the Japanese ministers stationed in China will become increasingly active in the future. Mr. Shiozawa, the Japanese minister stationed in Beijing, and Mr. Iwasaki, the minister stationed in Zhangjiakou, arrived here one after another on the 15th. Mr. Tajiri, the minister stationed in Shanghai, is also scheduled to arrive on the 16th. Ambassador Tani is scheduled to hold an important meeting with Mr. Horiuchi and other ministers at the ambassador's official residence on the 17th to discuss current issues.

In this battle, the southern route Japanese army departed from a certain location on the north bank of the Wei River at half past midnight on the 12th, and after occupying Zhijiang County, a stronghold of the Chongqing (55th Division), at dawn on the 13th, they continued to advance from the direction of Chayuansi (23 kilometers west of Zhijiang), occupying Xiqi (40 kilometers west of Gong'an) by the morning of the 14th.

<p>Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Churchill, broadcasting by wireless to England from Washington tonight, warned: "England is facing a terrible enemy, and the British Isles are still in danger of being invaded by Germany." He also stated that if Germany were to invade, the first to bear the brunt of the battle would be the domestic Home Guard. The Prime Minister's speech was delivered on the third anniversary of the founding of the Home Guard. The Prime Minister declared, "The entire fighting strength of England depends on the safe defense and full sustenance of our small island region. This region is only twenty-one miles from German cannons and only a few minutes' flight from German airfields." The Prime Minister also pointed out that England is still constantly being besieged and attacked by sea and air. He said, "The degree of danger of invasion depends entirely on the strength of the military and the preparations for dealing with the invasion. The larger our military, the more difficult it will be for the enemy to cross the sea and invade, and the better our goals will be."</p>

"We must overthrow Churchill's rule, because if we do not, Churchill may lead us to destruction." Churchill's acceptance of various rebel generals is a determination to continue the war with the blood of English workers. McGovern also commented on the idea of a union between the Labor Party and the Communist Party, saying that under certain circumstances, the Labor Party may have a future, but once it merges with the Communist Party, its end will begin.</p>

<p>Rome, 15th (Central News Agency) - Stefani News Agency, former Italian Minister of Culture, Pavolini, published an article in the News Report yesterday, recalling the heroic achievements of the Italian First Army, stating, "When the officers and soldiers received the order to cease resistance, they all had the determination to die. This brief order ended three years of war in Africa." Italy had done its best in this campaign, escorting weapons and troops by sea, supplying the needs of Abyssinia and Libya. Although the troops fighting overseas did not receive all the supplies they needed, everything that Rome had, or could be purchased from distant places such as Japan, was delivered to the Italian military bases in Africa in a timely manner. Even though the African campaign has now come to an end, its importance to the future trend of the war still exists. For three years, the African campaign has consumed the strength of the so-called civilized countries of Europe and has enabled the fortress of Europe to be realized. Moreover, Japan has had sufficient time to consolidate its occupied position, and Italy has been able to complete the defense of its territory. Therefore, it can be concluded that every soldier who died in Africa had his value. What closed in Africa the other day was a glorious chapter, but it was only a chapter, because the war history of Africa must continue.</p>
<h3 id="e15">On the Eastern Front, the Kuban Bridgehead Has Only Small-Scale Contact; Soviet Troops Attacking German Positions are Repulsed <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - Colonel Hammer, a military correspondent stationed on the Eastern Front for the German News Agency, stated today that although the climate on the Eastern Front has improved, there was only small-scale combat activity in the entire Kuban bridgehead area on Thursday. Soviet troops made small-scale attacks in various places with weak units, but were repulsed before they entered the forward positions of the German troops. However, it is expected that the Soviet army will launch large-scale attacks again in the near future. This can be clearly seen from the large-scale transportation activities and the increase in heavy weapons in the deployment area. However, the German troops have also made the necessary preparations for this move. At present, except for the area northwest of Lisichansk, which has been fiercely contested by both sides for several days, there is no other important activity in the entire Eastern Front. The Soviet army used heavy weapons and tanks to assist in an attempt to seize several of the Donets Heights defended by German grenadiers. Fierce fighting ensued, often developing into hand-to-hand combat. German troops were able to defend their positions and repelled the Soviet troops on all fronts. As dusk approached, the enemy was forced to retreat to its original position. Major Fleida, an air force correspondent for the German News Agency, stated that on Thursday, the German Air Force concentrated its guidance on the lower reaches of the Kuban and the Donets operational area, attacking bombers and dive bombers, and launching fierce attacks on Soviet transportation artillery positions, airfields, and railways. As a result, the enemy's rear equipment suffered great damage. German fighters often covered the German army in groups and were completely successful. The Soviet Air Force is still suffering from the losses it suffered last week, so on Thursday, it only operated in the Kuban area with small teams of fighters and fighter-bombers. In the air battles in that area, German fighters shot down 18 of the enemy's 30 aircraft, and 5 Soviet aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft guns.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to experts here, the United States is attempting to carry out a total counter-offensive against Japan, in addition to activities in the Attu Island area of the Aleutian Islands, and is also strengthening air bases in the southwestern Pacific, working hard to replenish troops, and increasing military supplies. However, the Japanese naval air force often launches preemptive strikes, day and night, launching operations to destroy American aircraft. For example, on the 11th of May, a combined formation of fighters and bombers bombed Meroce on New Guinea during the day. On the 14th, there was a heavy bombing of Java. When Japanese aircraft bombed Meroce on that day, they destroyed two enemy military facilities. More than ten other facilities, such as barracks, fuel depots, and ammunition depots, were also bombed and set on fire. After completing their mission, all the Japanese aircraft safely returned to their original defenses. Also, when a fighter squadron raided the American air base on Russell Island on the 13th, they engaged in a fierce air battle with 40 American aircraft. As a result, they shot down 34 giant fighters, 1 Type 38 aircraft, and 3 Type 39 aircraft, for a total of 38 aircraft. This fully demonstrated the cooperation and superior technology of the Japanese army. Two Japanese aircraft have not yet returned. This time, Japanese aircraft attacked 40 enemy aircraft with only a few aircraft. The damage ratio was 38 to 2, and they achieved more than ten times the results, which proves the superiority of Japanese air force combat technology. However, after this blow, the enemy is expected to stir again in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e21">Japanese Guard Unit Counterattacks: American Forces Land on Attu Island <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – According to military experts commenting on the Aleutian Islands battle, last June, the Japanese military's operations in the Midway Islands and the entire eastern Pacific region made it difficult for the enemy to cope. On June 4th, a surprise attack was launched on the enemy's base at Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands and surrounding military facilities. On the 5th, repeated attacks were carried out. On the 7th, through close coordination between land and naval forces, Kiska Island was captured. On the 8th, Attu Island was also captured, giving the Japanese a major base within the enemy's northern front, which was heavily defended. The enemy then began preparing for a counterattack. By this year, the enemy's land forces in Alaska and the eastern Aleutian Islands had been increased to several divisions, and air power had also increased to some extent. As a result, a sizable enemy fleet in the area began to operate, gradually pushing its base westward, intending to threaten the Japanese military. By early February of this year, an airfield was established at Amchitka, near the Japanese-occupied Kiska Island, equipped with giant aircraft and guarded by ground troops. Since then, the American military has repeatedly attempted to cut off Japanese supply lines with its air and naval forces, isolating the Japanese garrison and attempting to weaken Japanese strength by bombing Japanese positions. However, the Japanese military has been able to overcome difficulties such as ice, snow, heavy fog, and food shortages, firmly defending their positions and fiercely attacking incoming enemy aircraft with ground fire, preventing them from achieving their objectives. From January to April of this year, a total of over a dozen enemy aircraft have been shot down. Since the arrival of spring, the battle situation on the Aleutian front has become even more intense, and enemy air raids have gradually increased. On the 12th of this month, a strong enemy force, under the cover of heavy fog and its naval and air forces, landed on Attu Island. The Japanese guard unit immediately counterattacked, and fierce fighting is currently underway in the dense fog. There is no sign of the enemy on Kiska Island.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 15th (Central News Agency) – According to dispatches from Washington, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox stated that the recent landing of American forces on Attu Island was a joint operation by the Army and Navy, and the Marine Corps did not participate.</p>

<h3 id="e25">Japanese Naval Press Officer Broadcasts Frontline Situation: Soldiers' Morale High, All Confident of Victory; Land-Sea Integrated Operations Exhibit Ingenious Strategy <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – Lieutenant Colonel Tadashiro Kaku, a press officer from the Japanese Imperial Headquarters Navy, recently returned to the country after inspecting various frontline areas centered on the Solomon Islands in mid-April. At 7:30 PM on the 14th, he delivered a radio address from Tokyo titled "Returning from the Frontline," the main points of which are as follows: all Japanese-occupied territories, including the regions of Burma, the central Pacific, and the Aleutian Islands, are now decisive battlefields, and the time for decisive battle has arrived. During my recent inspection of the Solomon Islands frontline, I witnessed the extremely high morale of the soldiers, all of whom are confident of victory. The overall strategy of our operations is clear and obvious. Since the start of the war, we have quickly seized the enemy's bases and key points, consolidating our operational bases. Our forces then seized the opportunity to launch an offensive. In the South Pacific, we have suppressed the enemy from New Guinea to the Solomon Islands line. In "land-sea integrated" operations, we have displayed ingenious strategy and won every battle. During my visit to a certain base, a sudden air raid alert sounded in the middle of the night. I immediately jumped up and went to the designated location. I saw our commander and staff calmly observing the movements of the enemy aircraft. Their every action was calm and composed, which greatly increased my courage and convinced me that "we will definitely win this war." Furthermore, what moved me most on the front line was the close cooperation between the Japanese Army and Navy units, leaving no room for exploitation. For example, the Navy's food supply entirely depends on the Army's support, and there is no shortage. This is due to the Army's enthusiasm. Conversely, the Navy deeply appreciates the Army's efforts in fighting fiercely at the base, allowing the Navy to have no worries about the rear. Secondly, the spirit of our soldiers fighting hard: the region is a land of harsh, malarial conditions. Our forces are fighting on one hand with the enemy, and on the other hand with malaria. The United States once said that "this jungle area must be the worst battlefield for human combat," which is indeed true. It is said that the number of American soldiers who died from malaria is five times more than the number who died from gunfire. When the United States announced that the American Navy stationed on Guadalcanal Island was relieved by Army and Marine units during one day, almost none of these Navy units survived due to the Japanese military's fierce attacks and the prevalence of malaria. On the Japanese side, due to the activities of disease prevention teams, fewer people contracted the disease, which is a testament to the meritorious service of the disease prevention soldiers. In short, the integrated operations of the Japanese Army and Navy on the front line, and their loyal and resolute spirit, are deeply unforgettable for us.</p>

<p>— Tokutomi Iichiro</p>
<p>(4) Party Politics Leads to National Ruin</p>
<p>Among the many reasons for the decline of Great Britain, a major one is the political deadlock caused by British party politics. Britain is the birthplace of party politics, and those who praise party politics around the world regard Britain as their shrine. Just as Jerusalem is for Christians, Bodh Gaya is for Buddhists, Mecca is for Muslims, and Qufu is for Confucians, in the eyes of party politicians, the British Parliament in Westminster is the sacred main hall of party politics. Wouldn't it be surprising and shocking to them if this party politics were seen as the root cause leading Britain down the path to destruction? Originally, British political parties were not deliberately created, and they were more of a coincidence than a natural development. During the Stuart dynasty, Parliament was not even permanent, and sometimes both the government and the people seemed to forget its existence. The kings of that time struggled greatly to convene Parliament and manage finances, but the people seemed quite content. In the next generation of the Stuart dynasty, Parliament was convened more often, but the more it was convened, the more intense the opposition became, leading to the division between the Royalist and the Parliamentarian parties. James I was a philosopher and theologian; as a scholar, he had the knowledge of a rural university professor, and he even had writings. However, he did not understand the principles of governing the country and bringing peace to the world. At the time, he was rightly described as "the wisest fool in Christendom."</p>
<p>Later, under Charles I, war broke out. The Parliamentarian party was nicknamed the "Roundheads" because they wore short hair; the Royalist party was called the "Cavaliers" because they consisted mostly of mounted soldiers. Under Charles II, the Royalists regained power, but under James II, he tried to restore Roman Catholicism, which had been rejected during the reign of Henry VIII, and forced the people to adhere to his religious beliefs, causing chaos and ultimately leading to his expulsion. The new monarchs welcomed by the opposition party were William of Orange from the Netherlands and his wife, Mary.</p>
<p>After that, the Whig party (the predecessor of the Liberal Party) became dominant, and the Tory party (the predecessor of the Conservative Party) almost disappeared. Under Queen Anne, the two parties were again in opposition. After Queen Anne, the king brought from Hanover, George I, was already in his fifties when he ascended the throne. He did not understand English at all. Although traditionally, the king had to personally preside over cabinet meetings, because the new king did not understand English, he was like a puppet even if he attended cabinet meetings, so he abandoned the practice of personally attending cabinet meetings. The British system of responsible government thus originated from the foreign-born king's lack of English. If it is said to be accidental, there is probably no such accident.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the British cabinet, excluded from the King's affairs, was therefore held responsible to the Parliament. The responsibility of the ministers to the Parliament, and at the same time the joint responsibility of the ministers to each other, was thus established. Although there is a saying that "the king reigns but does not rule," it only became a common expression later.</p>
<p>In this way, the Whig party seized power with great force. It was not until George III, who was born in England and understood English, that there was a king who grew up in England. He wanted to restore royal power and rule personally, but he ultimately failed, and his ambition died with him. After that came the Victorian era. The Whig party became the Liberal Party, the Tory party became the Conservative Party. After the Irish Home Rule issue, the Unionists, who separated from the Liberal Party, merged with the Conservative Party, and the entire Conservative Party became known as the Unionist Party.</p>
<p>After the Irish question was resolved, the Conservative Party returned to its original form. Until after the First World War, the rise of the Labor Party led to the creation of a Labor Party cabinet. As a result, the Liberal Party became insignificant in British politics. The opposition between the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party became a thing of the past. To this day, what exists is only party politics in name. Therefore, today's British party politics is merely a formality. The idea of forming parties based on political views and implementing their claims and ideologies in actual politics is completely a relic of the past.</p>
<p>The British government, in theory, operates from top to bottom, with the distribution of power from the king to the nobility, from the nobility to the middle class, and from the middle class to the general public. However, in reality, it still remains in the hands of about a hundred noble or wealthy families. Their will, masked by the facade of party politics, is implemented smoothly and subtly. In short, British democracy is less a democracy of the people and more of a facade of democracy, carrying out the reality of oligarchy. Britain has maintained the feudal system since the Norman Conquest to this day, and has supplemented it with new transfusions of blood on the feudal system.</p>
<p>Platt said in the mid-Victorian era, "The owner of the land is the owner of the power." Currently, the owners of this land, during the seven years from 1920 to 1927, more than half of the landowners in England have changed. These people are the transfusers of blood into the aristocratic system.</p>
<p>These transfusers are Jews, or successful capitalists who have extremely close ties with Jews. They can effectively control Parliament at will. The veteran British journalist Lowe listed facts and discussed British politics, saying:</p>
<p>The British government is occupied by a class called a part of so-called social society. Those who are not tolerated in social society, no matter how talented they are, cannot become cabinet ministers.</p>
<p>Now, with the rise of the Labour Party, this situation may no longer be the same, but the main force still exists in the hands of the nobility and the wealthy. For example, in one era, the Cecil family in England had a father, nephew, and two sons, all of whom held important positions in the cabinet. At that time, the world called the cabinet the Cecil family's hotel company, because its relatives occupied as many as five positions in the cabinet.</p>
<p>Also, when the Chamberlain family was powerful, the British magazine "Punch" published a satirical drawing titled "The Expansion of the Empire Increases the Chamberlain Family's Contracting Work." This is because the Chamberlain family was a major shareholder in various munitions manufacturing companies in the Birmingham area. The powerful part of the company was owned or controlled by the Chamberlain family and their affiliates.</p>
<p>In 1940, a book entitled "The Hundred Families Who Dominate the British Empire" was published. According to this book, there is no significant difference between the British aristocracy, the wealthy, and political parties. They collude with each other, monopolize power, and indulge their private desires. Although what is described in the book may not be entirely credible, it is probably not too far off.

<h3 id="e39">China Film United Corporation Holds Tea Party Yesterday to Entertain the Press, Clarifies Management Policy, This Newspaper Opens Film Publicity Column <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>China Film United Corporation held a grand inaugural meeting the day before yesterday (14th). Yesterday (15th) at 3:00 PM, a tea party was held at the Metropole Hotel on Jiangxi Road to entertain the press for the establishment of the company. A large number of people gathered together in a warm atmosphere.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: First, Mr. Feng Jie, Standing Director and General Manager of the company, gave a speech, saying: "China Film United Corporation was formed by the merger of the original China, China United, and Shanghai Film companies. It started on May 1st and was officially announced to the public the day before yesterday, the 14th. Our company has a solid foundation and is not a hastily created organization. Its life is entrusted to the hands of people from all walks of life who love our company, to the hands of the government, and to the hands of officials and people from China, Japan, and Manchuria. There is no doubt about its future development. Our colleagues will uphold the difficulty of creation and the expectations of enthusiastic people, be of one heart and one mind, be practical and realistic, and strive for the Chinese film industry, for the people of society, and for the entire Greater East Asia. In the future, we will strive to become a modern cultural enterprise, whose performance can adapt to the requirements of the great era, and especially to enhance the spirit of "doing", hoping to advance vigorously with the general cause. In the current situation, the entire China and the entire East Asia are struggling hard. "Doing" means survival, and not "doing" means destruction. There is really no turning back. I have been serving in Shanghai for more than a year under the government's order to promote propaganda administration. Thanks to the guidance of the central government, the assistance of friendly officials and people, and the love of people from all walks of life, the progress has been very smooth and I am very grateful. I hope to receive even more assistance in the future."</p>
<p>Organizational Report: Then, Deputy General Manager Zhang Shankun reported on the merger of the company, saying: "Our company was established by the merger of China Film Company, China United Film Production Company, and Shanghai Cinema Company in order to adapt to the wartime cultural propaganda system. The production, distribution, and cinema departments are integrated into one. As the Deputy Manager of the production department, I will briefly report on the future film production policy. In the early stage of China United's film production, there was a slight emphasis on profitability, and some neglect in awareness was inevitable. However, in the later stage, film production was not for profit but had more educational and cultural components, and the awareness was quite pure. For example, the recent production of 'Wan Shi Liu Fang' has been praised by the press. In the future, our company's film production policy will follow the right track and work hard, but the company's colleagues have limited intelligence, and I hope that the press will continue to give us serious guidance." Next, Deputy General Manager Ishikawa Shunju reported on the current organizational status, saying: "The company is divided into five departments internally. The production department has been reported by Deputy Manager Zhang as above. The General Affairs Department is no different from ordinary companies and manages general affairs and accounting matters. The Distribution Department not only distributes the company's films but also focuses on film exchange. On the one hand, it distributes the company's films throughout East Asia, and on the other hand, it distributes Japanese and Manchu films. The Theater Department manages the operation of cinemas. Currently, the company directly manages 20 cinemas in Shanghai and more than 15 in South China and other places. In the future, the operation of cinemas will be further expanded. The Mobile Screening Department was established to adapt to the lack of cinemas in China. Mobile screening is very important in villages without cinemas, but there are many difficulties, but we will continue to work hard to complete the mission. In addition, there is also the organization of the Design Committee, whose task is not limited to one aspect but is designed for the development of each department and serves as a consulting body for the General Manager. The Film Research Institute specializes in researching film technology and investigating the development trends of the film industry. At the same time, branch offices are set up in various places, such as Nanjing, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Tokyo, all of which were established to adapt to the new stage."</p>
<p>Proposal by this Newspaper: Finally, Mr. Chen, President of this newspaper, proposed that the "Free Talk" section of this newspaper be used once a week as a film publicity column, as a gift to celebrate the establishment of China Film United Corporation. General Manager Feng accepted and expressed his gratitude. At 5:00 PM, refreshments were served and the meeting dispersed.</p>
<p>Brief Biography of Feng: The establishment of China Film United Corporation this time, with Feng Jie, Director of the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office, serving as Standing Director and General Manager, is deeply gratifying to all parties. Mr. Feng is an alternate executive member of the Central Committee and Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department, and was specially appointed by the National Government as a member of the New National Movement Promotion Committee. He came to Shanghai last February and served concurrently as the Director of the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office of the National Government. It is said that Mr. Feng will devote himself to the film industry in the future. Due to the factual relationship, the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office will only be an institution representing the Propaganda Department in Shanghai to guide and supervise its subordinate institutions and contact them. All affairs will be executed by the affiliated institutions, and the title of Director will still be held concurrently by Mr. Feng. It is also said that the office will be moved to the Hamilton Building.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Admonishing Trade Associations <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Recently, trade associations in various industries have been reorganized one after another, and they are about to be completed. Organizing the ranks and refreshing the methods are good phenomena at present, but there are still many facts of performance that cannot immediately make people optimistic and have to be spoken frankly.</p>
<p>(1) Mutual contention among tradesmen. Often in the same association, A believes that the organization was first, while B claims that it has been contacted earlier. When the preparers are announced, those who are not selected often create additional problems, and the moderators are close to exclusion, causing many disputes and making the authorities feel difficult.</p>
<p>(2) Before the organization, each often has a private right concept, unwilling to be open and honest, and extend the business's well-reputed businessmen to participate together, even regarding the association as a private institution, only for the benefit of a few people, regardless of the public's welfare.</p>
<p>(3) The people used are not very selective, allowing one or two villains to mix among them, inevitably taking advantage of their position, causing criticism from the industry and inevitably affecting the group's prestige.</p>
<p>It must be known that running a public association is for the public, not for the private; it is for the benefit of the majority, not for the benefit of the minority; it is an absolutely public undertaking, not an ambiguous and self-serving collusion. Everything must have a spirit of great justice and selflessness, and extend the industry's public opinion. Everything should be considered for the overall situation of the country and society, not for personal rights and interests, and should be widely visited and connected to help the industry resolve difficulties; all matters that hinder the country, society, and the public should be eliminated vigorously, without favoritism, without corruption, without allowing villains, and without employing the wrong people. Only then can the reputation of the trade association be maintained without loss, and only then can it be sufficient to assist the difficult task of the Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Chamber of Commerce and Industry Establishes Three New Committees, Recruiting Leading Figures from the Military, Government, and Private Sectors to Participate <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Since Japan implemented a new economic policy towards China, the Japanese economic community in Shanghai has had a great impact. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry has reviewed this issue and has decided to recruit powerful figures from the military, government, and private sectors to form a Sino-Japanese Consulting Committee. The Economic Shanghai Construction Committee and the Japanese Business Countermeasures Committee were approved at the general meeting on the 14th. The three newly established committees will adopt close links with the existing five departments of finance, transportation, industry, trade, and commerce within the Chamber of Commerce and Industry to establish a comprehensive policy system. This is its greatest purpose.</p>
<p>For this reason, the shortcomings of individual research and review of countermeasures in the past can be swept away from now on. In the future, all issues can be comprehensively summarized and considered from a legal standpoint, and countermeasures can be established. It is planned to carefully study specific countermeasures at each committee meeting. In addition, in order to review various issues from a broad standpoint, small committees will be set up under each committee, and celebrities from the military, government, and private sectors will be invited to participate. Small committees will be set up in Nanjing and Tokyo as necessary. From now on, Japan and Shanghai will echo each other, assisting in promoting the policy towards China and the new economic policy from the side, and at the same time contributing to the development of the Japanese economic community in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Regarding the operation of the three committees, Chairman Aoki of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry will explain it at the first joint meeting on the 19th. At the same time, the chairman and secretary-general of each committee will be appointed from among the members. Mr. Takeuchi Fumihiko, Executive Director of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, will serve as the secretary-general, and the secretaries will be selected from the members and the secretariat. At that time, Minister Tajiri and General Affairs Section Chief Okazaki of the Embassy, Economic Minister Okuda, and the heads of the economic departments of the Embassy, and Economic Section Chief Tanaka of the Consulate will also be present. The purposes of the three committees are as follows:</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese Affairs Committee</p>
<p>Due to the conversion of diplomatic policies, various Sino-Japanese relations have changed. However, the meaning of the conversion of diplomatic policies is not yet thorough. If the interpretations of China and Japan are different, it is difficult to achieve the purpose of the policy. Therefore, it is intended to exchange various information and review countermeasures in order to cooperate in promoting the restoration of the original Sino-Japanese relations in the economic and political fields.</p>
<p>Economic Shanghai Construction Committee</p>
<p>Due to the promotion of the new economic policy, the revitalization of China's economy is the most important issue. Therefore, the economic revival of Shanghai, known as the economic base of Central China, must be paid attention to. The success or failure of the construction of economic Shanghai is a major issue that affects the economic revival of China. The purpose is to review the revival of production, price countermeasures, material movement, and financial currency issues from various aspects in order to study and establish countermeasures.</p>
<p>Japanese Business Countermeasures Committee</p>
<p>Due to the vigorous promotion of the new economic policy, it is expected that Japanese business associations and firms will also undergo considerable changes. At the same time, experts generally advocate the reorganization and merger of associations, as well as the issue of changing industries. Therefore, the purpose of this committee is to establish countermeasures as the center to ensure Japanese economic power.</p>

<h3 id="e42">The Economic Bureau Will Restore the Special Price Deliberation Council <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Economic Bureau regards stabilizing prices and ensuring people's livelihoods as the current key strategy. In accordance with the provisions of the central government's laws and regulations, in order to thoroughly rectify the city's prices, it is planned to restore the Municipal Price Deliberation Council and has been reported to the Huashi Municipal Government for approval and is actively preparing for it. However, before the establishment of the Council, all industries must sell according to the prices before the 30th of last month, and absolutely must not exceed them. Violators will be punished. The industry associations have been instructed to inform their respective businesses to strictly abide by them.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Hua Stock Trends <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Hua stocks turned firm. New Pharmaceutical continued to be hoarded by investors who made large purchases. China-France Pharmacy was the firmest, rising by more than three yuan. New Asia followed, rising by 125, with sales. The volume of transactions was also huge. The department store industry was also the target of investors. Wing On Company rose by six yuan, and National Goods rose by another two and a half yuan. Sincere alone fell by five yuan. Wing On Textile Mill in the textile industry rose by five yuan, and Mei Ya Silk Mill rose by three yuan amid buying momentum. The public utility industry was relatively stagnant. Zhabei Water and Electricity and China General Edison remained at their original prices. In the cultural industry, China Bookstore suddenly showed weakness. Commercial Press and World Bookstore were flat. Greater China Match slightly decreased. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company has rebounded by five yuan. Jiu An Industrial and New Yick Land also rebounded slightly by half a yuan and ten cents. Other stocks also mostly rose. China Brick and Tile will have a shareholders' meeting today, and there is news of capital increase.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Registration Period for Yarn and Cloth Expires <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The supplementary registration of cotton yarn and cotton cloth organized by the National Commercial Control Association ended yesterday (15th). No less than two hundred and several tens of cotton yarn and cotton cloth merchants went to register. It is learned that the supplementary registration of the Association has ended and will send staff to investigate. If unregistered cotton yarn and cotton cloth are found, in addition to not being able to enjoy the rights of purchase and movement, they will also be punished according to law.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Director Inagaki Talks About Cooperating to Thoroughly Investigate Hoarding <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The joint Sino-Japanese Materials Investigation Committee consists of Deputy Director Gotoh and Director Inagaki of the Materials Control Bureau of the Municipal Council. Director Inagaki recently gave a statement as follows: "I have not formally heard any intentions regarding this matter, and I only learned about the appointment in the newspaper. Therefore, the specific situation is not very clear. The Municipal Council will definitely fully cooperate with the National Government's policies. This point need not be repeated. The Municipal Council is also prepared to exert its capabilities and thoroughly investigate hoarding based on the decision of the Supreme National Defense Conference of the National Government. Of course, the hoarding in Shanghai now is done by people in the financial community, but the hoarding nature also exists in the practice of producers and wholesalers stockpiling goods for speculation. It is hoped that the distribution mechanism can be rectified, and at the same time, the National Government will launch decisive measures to deal with hoarded materials. A thorough investigation cannot be an end in itself, and it must be based on the investigation and focus on dealing with hoarding." (Cloud Peng: Translated from the May 15th Mainland News)</p>
<h3 id="e46">Reactions from All Sectors to the Establishment of the Materials Investigation Committee <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>In order to deal with the problem of hoarding, the Supreme National Defense Conference approved the establishment of the Materials Investigation Committee on the 13th, which will be jointly organized by China and Japan. All sectors have expressed great concern about this. The reactions within the concession are generally as follows:</p>
<p>(1) After the first thorough investigation was completed, the people unanimously hoped that a second team of thorough investigation officials would be sent. It is now gratifying that a permanent Sino-Japanese cooperation mechanism can be established to promote the elimination of hoarding. At the current stage of abolishing extraterritoriality and implementing the new economic policy, the establishment of this Sino-Japanese joint committee is the result of the Japanese side's enthusiasm to assist the National Government. All sectors in the concession attach importance to the fact of Japanese cooperation and have high expectations for its future.</p>
<p>(2) After the first thorough investigation, the wholesale prices on the black market fluctuated up and down. On average, there was no increase in April, but the hoarded goods that were released did not flow into the market. However, A's hoarders released them, and B's hoarders bought them in. It has nothing to do with retail prices. Therefore, the hoarding problem and the price problem still need to be resolved in the future. It is hoped that this newly established committee will resolve them appropriately.</p>
<p>(3) When implementing the investigation of hoarded materials, it is hoped that the authorities will fully review the facts of hoarding and take realistic measures. For example, the hoarding methods of large hoarders are extremely clever. They break up their materials into smaller units and entrust them to their related businesses and relatives to conceal them. Hoarders who are not members of the same industry association entrust members of the same industry association to register in a false name, which does not match the original name of the owner. Moreover, all registered materials are ostensibly sold according to the limited price, but this is not the case in reality. Most of them enter and exit the black market, and beyond the black market, there is also a so-called black black market. The general black market already occupies a position similar to the official black market. There is a black market in this official black market, so there is a so-called black black market. Since the hoarding methods are so complicated, it is hoped that the authorities will fully consider this point when conducting the thorough investigation.</p>
<p>(4) The Materials Investigation Committee also includes key Japanese military and political figures representing the General Headquarters, the Embassy, the Gendarmerie, and the Municipal Council. This is the reason why the people have expectations for the committee. At the same time, since the first thorough investigation, a lively public opinion has been seen. They will definitely be concerned about the future investigation, and they hope to realize the Sino-Japanese military, government, and people's cooperative system and establish an institution that accepts public criticism in good faith. The official has permanent laws and organizations such as the hoarding crime punishment regulations, the main commodity registration rules, and the materials investigation committee. It is also hoped that a permanent civil organization that can provide planned assistance will be established as soon as possible, such as a price issue research association, etc., so as to provide opinions to the Materials Investigation Committee at any time, and officials and the people can reach a consensus to solve the hoarding problem. This is the urgent task. (Cloud Peng: Translated from the May 15th Mainland News)</p>
