<h3>星期評論心理長城</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭的形勢無論變化到如何慮烈，其結局總是歸於正洲勝利，我對於這一點，抱有充分的樂觀。因為我知道只要日本打擊英美的侵略　義，以及本着眞正的亞精神，則全世界人口的過半數一定會成為日本的後盾　日本具有的物質文明，與熱烈希望解放的整個亞洲民族，二者結合，就會構成全世界史上空前的一個偉大力量。日本具有的物質文明，是在亞細亞生產方法上發展出來的特殊文明，凡亞洲民族不求解放則已，如求解放，則在其解放過程上，是必然採取的物質文明的特殊形式。另外，所　　着亞洲精神者，並不僅是說，日本站在亞洲人一份子的立塲上的覺悟，其實　　這一點也够偉大了——且是亞洲各民族歷史中發展起來的各自反抗精神，換言之，精神往往藉物質豐富而反對外來支配的勢力，精神是想維持自己的獨立自由的不斷欲求。</p>
<p>亞洲人籍精神的自身作用而觀察自己的精神，以把握共木體為終身專業。在其過程上，亞洲人對抗歐洲人的物質文明，而發展了高深奧妙的精神文明。言及亞洲的精神文明，則會立刻想到中國的孔子老子，印度的佛敎，或日本的神道。但亞洲人的精神文明特色，並不滿足於此等旣成物，且以此等物為跳板，而躍入更高處，隨着跳躍同時，捨棄這類跳板，而不斷實行新的進展。但此外，對於不受仟何東西拘束的精神進展，並非按論理上的分析就可以知道的，而是藉體騐才能把握到的直感境地。這種精神狀熊究竟為何物，在此我舉幾個實例來說明。</p>
<p>有名的希臘哲學家代俄哲尼期（Diogenes　412　B．C．－323　B．C．），寶際上是生於小亞細亞希諾皮（Sinoqe土耳其黑海沿岸的一個城市）的。他被人稱作「桶仙」，因為貧窮，無家可歸，所以就在路旁的桶中生活。當時有勇猛警戰，征服極大領土的亞力山大其人者，經其朋友阿利期提巴（Arislippus）的介紹，而願和代戰哲尼斯會晤。常時住在雅典的代俄哲尼斯，對於這個要求便寫了一封信去說，如願意見面的話，即請亞力山大帝御駕親臨他住的地方。我們暫且翻開他信的全文看看：</p>
<p>「阿利期提巴！接讀來信，藉悉馬其頓國王亞力山大很願見我。你給亞力山大加上馬其領國玉的稱號，這是你自己的事（例如僅管馬其頓人怎樣），但你是知道的，我並非誰的部下。假使亞力山大帝願意知道我和我的生活的話，那就請他到敝處來。且我認為由雅典去馬其頓，和由馬其頓來雅典，是有同樣遠近的距離。」</p>
<p>對於征服全世界的亞力山大的威武，毫無畏懼之色，也毫無卑屈之勢，不管于切，仍然按照自己之所欲，按照自己之所信，不受任何物件拘束的自由精神，而活生生地表現於這一簡短的信札裹。</p>
<p>以後亞力山大帝於雅典會見代俄哲尼斯。亞力山大帝對代俄哲尼期行禮後，便問「你希望什麼？」代俄哲尼斯對於這個問題只說了一句話：：「不要站在我的前面」。當時握有全世界的財當與權力的亞力山大，也終於在代俄哲尼斯的面前，感覺到自己像乞丐一樣。</p>
<p>不受外物影響的道種眞正自山精神，是超越於生死問題的。這種精神狀態，可以說日本的武士道為其登峯造極現象。日本的劍道乃使精神達到此種狀態的一個手段。因此日本的劍道，與其說看重技藝，莫如說更着重精神狀態，這就是劍道與外國的Fencing（劍術）不同處。</p>
<p>日前在大華大戲院演出日本影片「一乘寺決鬥」片中主角宮本武藏並非虛構人物，乃籍劍道實現出這種精神狀熊的人物之一。他的高足中有寺尾求馬之助其人者，為細川府之家人，有一天，細川府的主人細川光尙向宮木武藏說，藉劍道而能逮到任何外物所不能動搖的精神（宮本武藏名之為「岩之身」）是什麼？宮本武藏說：『那末我就在實際上給你看這種精神吧』，說完後，立刻就把寺尾求馬之助叫來，宮本武歲坐在細川光尙的傍面，對寺尾求馬之助說：「奉主人命令，叫寺尾求馬之助此時此地破腹自斃」。當時封建君主的命令是絕對的，臣下必須在任何情形下立刻絕對服從。求馬之助一聽到這個話，毫不猶豫地說：「遵命，就在傍而屋子內實行破復」，行禮如儀後，便鎭靜地從屋子內走出。由始至終求馬之助的熊度毫不改變，完全與平常無異。武藏對光尙說：「現在你所看到的求馬之助的態度，便是「岩之身」。光尙大為感動，便召回求馬之助來，大加　當劍所養成的精神。獲得到眞正自由的精神，是　死的恐布中解放出來，這統是「視死如歸」的狀態。</p>
<p>孔子也常常覓視克己的自由精神。因此他對於具着這種精神的弟子顏回，非常重視。現在我們從「史記評林」中關於顏回的一段，摘錄下來看一下。</p>
<p>「顏回者魯人也，字子淵少孔子三十歲，顏回問仁，孔子曰：「克己復禮，天下歸仁焉」。孔子日：「賢哉回也，一軍食一瓢飲，在陋巷，人不堪其憂，同也不改其樂，回也如愚，退而省其私，亦足以發，回也不愚，用之則行，拾之則藏，唯我與爾有是夫。」</p>
<p>顏回雖會受孔子勸告出而當官，但他拒絕道一意見，而甘願一簞食一瓢飮。當然，他如握有政治實權，會實踐其道的，但當時各國的政治非常混亂，他的道實在沒有實行的可能，所以一般人說顏回「在陋巷不改其樂」，責際上，他是喜歡愛好精神的獨立自出。</p>
<p>孔子此外還會講過他的門徒子路的人格：「衣敝缊袍，與衣狐　省立而不恥者，共山也歟！」這一句話也很可以表現出子路不及外物影響的自由精神。後來，子路於衛國內亂時陣亡，當時子路的態度也會表示出超越生死的自由精神，關於這一記戲，我們看一下「史記評林」：</p>

<p>「子路為衛大夫孔悝之邑宰，蕢聵乃與孔悝作亂，謀入孔悝家，遂與其徒襲攻出公，出公奔魯，而養聵入立，是為莊公。方孔悝作亂，子路在外聞之而馳往，遇子羔出衛城門，謂子路曰：「出公去矣，而門已閉，子可還無，母空受其禍」。子路曰：「食其食者不遜其難」。子羔卒去，有使者入城，城門開，子路隨而入。造蕢聵，薑聵與孔悝登台，子路曰：「君焉用孔悝，請得而殺之」。薑聵弗聽，於是子路欲燔台，薑聵懼，乃下石乞壺　攻子路，擊斷子路之纓，子路曰：「君子死而冠不免」。遂結纓而死」。</p>
<p>子路之死，果如子羔之言，「空受其禍」；然而決非如此的，而是在自由精神的前面而超越了生死的觀念，是有不可抑制的自由働動，子路只是按着這種精神作的。同樣把握到自由精神三昩境的孔子，所以一聽到衛國內亂時，馬上就預言到「嗟乎！由死矣」！</p>
<p>吉田松蔭——為日本攘夷尊皇論者，欲乘外國船赴海外，被幕府所捕，而斬首——在斬首前，會傍若無人大聲歌唱：「雖然知道要這樣就這樣，但有神聖不可侵犯的大和魂」。眞正的自由精神，是具有不顧任何利害，具有不可抑制的衝動等特徵的。這一點是與歐洲人的精神少有不同。當尼羅（Nero）暴君在羅馬殘殺基督敎徒時，使徒彼得（Peter）首先從羅馬逃出，在途中他會責難自已，不應當把很多基督敎徒還留在後面，自己單獨一個人逃難。正在那個時候，他看見在天上基督向羅馬去的影踪。使徒彼得便閒基督說：「師傳，您上什麽地方去？Que　Vadis　Domin。」。基督回答說：「我替你到羅馬去」。於是彼得又返回到羅馬，而就尼羅的十字架。假如這是寺尾求馬之助，是子路，是吉田松蔭等人的話，就用不着問「師傳，您到什麼地方去？」而早就視死如歸，接受死型了。以泰然自若的心境，能由生走向死的這種精神狀態——心凉則火亦不熱——這就是東洋人的自由精神。在阿圖島，在瓜達加那兩島陣亡的日本軍隊，大多數都是日本的農民，各種職員，或普通人，然而這樣的人都沒有被敵人俘虞去，一直戰鬥到最後一個人，最後一滴血，這可以證明「亞細亞精神」的偉大存在。若把這一點和歐洲人那種精神比較一下，是最淸楚不過的。在亞細亞的精神當中，由始到終就沒有計算其成敗，因為亞洲人知道在應當死的時候就死，這就是生的實際表現，就是精神永久生存的不二法門。</p>
<p>這種精神，在大東亞戰爭進行當中，對於英美說，就是不能理解的眞正亞細亞的日本心理長城。然而這種心理長城並百日本人所獨有的，如果這是是本人所獨有的，那末大東亞戰爭的前途，就不能樂觀了。我對大東亞戰爭所以抱樂觀者，就是因為我相信中日有這樣共同的自由精神，本體亞洲人有這樣共同的自由精神。如日本能把這種亞細亞精神振奮起來，如能用日本的物質文明把這種亞細亞精神武裝起來，那末大東亞戰爭的形勢，無論一時怎樣劇烈殘酷，但最後勝利的到來是毫無疑問的。假設全體日本人都能理解中國人當中也存在着這種自由精神，我認為全面和平馬上就可以實現。假定日本也有超越利害的自由精神，中國也有超越利害的自由精神，那末中日戰爭決不會永久相互拿着武器而不結束，這是一個極簡單的理論。（漢譯）</p>
<p>附言：星期評論，原定昨日發表，因慶祝接收租界，發行特刋，改在今日補刋。</p>
<h3>緬甸獨立新展望　宣傳部林部長話</h3>
<p>大東亞戰爭發生以後，緬甸即獲得解放，經日本之協助，已於昨　一日）宣吿獨立，宣傳部林部長為此發　談話如下：</p>
<p>東亞整個解放</p>
<p>「今天——民國三十二年八月一日，是中國收囘租界最後底於成功的日子，又是緬甸獨立的日子，也就是東亞解放途程上劃時代的界碑，前者說明中的光明，後者證明保密東亞的陣容日以鞏固，這兩件事完成於大東亞戰爭節而勝利的　候，更共同得到友邦日本的協助，實足以證明東亞各國家的獨立自由，與束亞聲個的解放，是不可分的，凡是中國人，東亞人，際此偉大的可紀念的日子，於同深慶祝之餘，當益　責任之重大，以邁往之精神，担負起此劃時代的使命。</p>
<p>與中國的關係</p>
<p>緬甸與中國在歷史上的關係，非常深長，在地理上的關係，亦形同脣齒，自印度為英國侵略勢力所併呑之後，緬甸亦不幸淪為其殖民地，英國遂藉以進一步的侵略中國，彼此安危相共，痛療相關，自不待言，故中國革命同志對於緬旬問題，夙極關切，過去緬甸民族的解放運動，曾經過三次大的流血，和無數次的鬥爭，中國革命同志，對此，尤寄予無限的同情。當這次緬甸獨立的，正式消息傳出後，中國政府及人民興奮情緒，更增加對於今後緬甸民族的期待，進而對於東亞前途　更具有新的展望。</p>
<p>國家集團意義</p>
<p>其一：緬何民族求獨立的要求，孕育巳久，形之於激烈之行動，亦非一日，何以於大東亞戰爭以後，始吿實現，可見世界政治經濟發展到了國家集團主義的今日，一個國家獨立自由之獲得與確保，不僅以單純的民族自覺意識為其內包，尤須以國家集團之自覺意識為其外延，緬旬一國的獨立，不能走到東亞解放的前面，必須求之於東亞解放之中，</p>
<p>事實的趨向實不容吾人膜然視之·全東亞民族·鑒於中國的收同租界，及緬何之獨立，對於白已的命蓮，當然能知所抉擇，且必能發生更大的更氣，作更大的努力，緬旬獨立之後，必能為緬甸之前途，為東亞之共同命運，與友邦日本緊密協力，與我國携手共進，司以斷言。</p>
<p>誠意團結之果</p>
<p>其二：英美侵略者過去魚肉一般弱小民族，一無顧忌，歐洲戰爭及大東亞戰爭發生之後，汲汲自危，以所謂太平洋憲章，對久受壓迫之民族，作最後的欺騙，其心跡了然可知。友邦日木站在大東亞戰爭的前衛，為東亞的先進國家，固不必以任何虛偽的憲章相維繫，以空言作標榜，然而東條自相之迭次聲明，與接連此項聲明的事實表現，實較諸任何憲章具有誠意且有力量。對於緬甸的獨立，我們的觀察是如此，對於上海相界收同我們所體認的也是如此。我們深信東亞民族間，必須以誠意求團結，以團結求大東亞戰爭之勝利，以此勝利，求束亞民族之共存共榮。</p>
<p>印度獨立前奏</p>
<p>其三，緬甸獨立其影響不僅為緬甸一國，對於大來亞解放之前途，所關甚大。我們可以說緬甸獨立，實即印度獨立之前癸。久被英帝國主義者蹂躪踐踏的印度同胞，目觀緬甸之獨立，必愈益奮發，於友邦日不援助之下，興英帝國主義者為最後之殊死戰，務使大東亞解放途程上最後一塊大地，復歸於東亞，印度同胞，還其自由。</p>
<p>當此緬旬獨立之日，願以最大之熱誠，祝緬甸國運昌隆，祝大東亞戰爭勝利，祝大東亞共榮團無量之發展。</p>

<h3>上海公共租界交還後感想　日田尻公使一日晚在滬廣播演詞</h3>
<p>上海公共租界巳於昨（一）日由我國收囘，特命全權公使田尻愛義氏，特於一日晚九時至九時十五分，在上海廣播電台發表廣播演說，　為「上海公共租界交還後感想」。對於交還租界之眞實意義，有詳盡闡述。茲將田仄公使漢說內容，分　於次：</p>
<p>中國歷史上大事業</p>
<p>上海公共租界行政　巳於本日上午九時半，在　嚴爾且隆重之儀式中，正式交還中國，並由上海市政府第一區公署接收，又法租界已於前（卅）日交還中國竣事，至此上海租界行政權，已永久不復存在，上海公共租界之交還中國，不僅為完成中國主權上最重要之要素，更為中國歷史上　期的大事業，惟入月一日實可謂値得中國永遠紀念之　進日</p>
<p>排除英美最後一頁</p>
<p>鴉片戰爭以來，百年問上海公共租界不啻為英美侵略東亞最大前衛據點，英美　國每假借租界工部局或關係國聯帶關係之名義，而阻止中國之統一發達。妨害中日提携，侵略束亞及擾亂和平等，竭盡其野心，其罪惡之多，更不勝枚舉。此種英美之租界罪惡吏。亦因日本發動大東亞戰爭及在中國排除英美勢力。而使成最後之一頁。其後一年又牛中。因維特治安及邁行戰爭上之必要，故末見即對租界問　作最後之處理。茲日本根據東亞之道義，將英美罪惡　跡之上海公共租界迅交遼中國，同時新中國亦以近代國家之資格，向完成建設勇往邁進，日本對此，誠不勝引為深有意義。</p>
<p>交還租界根本方針</p>
<p>日本已將大束亞地域從英美之桎梏政中解放，今更進一步　向積極建設大東亞新秩序邁進，日本對緬旬菲律賓之獨立。爪哇層民之參與行政，泰國之恢復失地，以及即慶獨立運動等之公正熱心之援助，實足以表現日本關　大東亞各民族建設政治，及經濟文化等鐵秩序之根本方針，同時此次交還租界，亦為日本此種根本方針之一部份而責施者，因此粗界之交還，不可僅就中日關係而加觀察也。</p>
<p>忽視意義實屬誤解</p>
<p>帝國與中國應為建義大束亞共榮圈之中核，今無更加以銳明之必要，帝國對于促進新中國之獨立完成，並建設興陸，以及樹立中日協力之新關係，　為努力。此乃因新中國之發展與隆，由八絃一宇之大理想而觀，不獨為當然之舉，且為建設大東亞之前提，因中日軸心之紿成，為確立共榮圈之核心故也。租界之交還，乃其第一階梯，具有極達大意義，然一般中國人熱迷於目前利益，勸轍縣此次之交遠租界，僅為政治上的遊戲，有忽視其遠大意義之傾向，此實係非常誤解，為敵方宣傳所乘之結果。要知無獨立完成之民生，秘殖民地民生，乞丐生活實無二致也。又如正直觀察大東亞戰爭勃發後，所展開之世界史之新方向，及共現實之過程，則英美之舊秩序，實到虛均有破綻，一方大東亞之解放與建設，現正獲得大東亞十億民族之贊同與協力，此種事實，誠非可忽視，其間獨渝方終始輿央美之舊支配勞力互相勾結，繼續無益抗戰，以與注力於大東亞之興隆，及新中國之建設之國民政府互相比較，何者眞向世界史命令方向推進自極明顯，租界之交還決非宣傳國府强化之政治的手段，乃為以大東亞之興隆為目標，協力建設新中國之帝國道義外交之一端，中國人人應率道毫無私心予以接受，廉潔抵身協力國府，方始為眞愛中國。且中國業對英美實戰，眞愛中國者必欣然　附於孫中山先生所主張之大亞細亞主義，且不懵犠牲，敢然以救濟及建設大東亞為目標，由各方面確立總力戰的戰時體制，以建設道應大東亞新秩序申核之新國家，全國朝野當須一致齊向此種方面　往邁進也。</p>
<p>建設新中國出發點</p>
<p>再觀收囘後之租界經營，對於新中國之建設關係實極重大，此乃因向來阻碍中國發展之租界，今後將成為由政治•經濟•文化各方面建設近代國家之出發點故也。新中國之建設，並非以收囘租界形式上主權之完整，即吿終了，就上海而實，上海之政治環繞舊租界以市政府為核心，必須更向前踏進，上海與各地之經　融合大事業，亦務須完成，尤以各年盤踞上海租界阻碍中國興隆之英獎思想，仍未肅淸，中國之本然思想，尙未復蘇，故應不失此翻機會，努力肅淸英美思想，租界收囘後之建設新上海，實實為賦與上海人之重大課　及責任。今日之上海實需要三十二年前辛亥革命之精神，及血的努力，國府當局以及上海指導層，靑年層，茲已欣逢奮起時機，如缺乏此種奮起•犧牲•努力，而暢論參戰者，實全無意義，為使租界收搏獲得美滿結果，除此以外，中爾再無共他進取之道，對於新上海之建設，日本因不惜予以好意支援，當翻閱由明治維新至中國第一革命，更至解放束亞，觀戰爭之史頁，可知其中實充滿崇高之革新思想，日本尤其在華日僑，應把握此項本義，協力建設上海，中國人之血及汗之努力，再加以日僑之協力，則新上海乃吿建成，如此則大東亞戰爭之勝利及塋譽，新生上海始能分擔，日本僑民亦應深感其貴任之電大，以異常之決心，應付此一時局也。</p>
<p>陳市長今晚與</p>

<p>上海特別市今日（一日）下午四時舉行「慶祝收囘租界民衆代表大會，」國府汪主席躬蒞致訓，茲錄訓詞原文如下：我所要說的話，在今天廣播裏巳經說過了，現在只補充幾句。二十九年四月廿六日，國民政府慶視還都的時候，我發表一篇論文，是「罪己的精神，」在慶祝的時候，最需要的是自已檢討，自己鞭策，如今參加這慶祝上海收囘粗界大會，我仍然是這一種罪已的精神。中國為什麼有租界呢？一方面是英美的侵略，一方面是我們不能抵禦英美的侵略，這一點我們不能不自責。上海為什麼有租界呢？就是一班人喊得震心的所謂曾文正李文忠為要打收太平天國，不惜惜助英國的洋槍隊，於是以上海租界為報酬，這一點我們尤共不能不自實。自從上海有了租界之後，雖然也有熱烈的收囘租界運動，可是視租界一為安樂窩的，也有其人，這一點我們又不能不自責。這一次收囘租界，不是我們自已力量，而是友邦日本援助的力量，我們回顧過去，正視現在，屬望將來，只有自己檢討，自己鞭策。我還有很痛心的話，二十入年五月，我到了上海，主持和平反共建圍運動。當時重慶方面，如能采納我的主張，即當歐戰發生時，中日兩國，已經能夠同心協力，從容應付了，何致遷延以至今日，即使不然，只要上海兩租界的同胞，能采納我的主張。一致努力，則常大束亞戰爭發生時，上海巳經有了整　三年的組織訓練，必能齊心合作，處理時局。在大東亞戰爭中，發揮出很大的力量，同時上海人民的生活，如今日物價之不安定等等，至少可减去三分之二，何致有今日之要象呢！同　過去，只有痛心，我們還是正視現在。屬望將來，好好的鞭策自已罷。上海同胞是否還有懷疑於大東亞戰爭之勝利呢？上海是謠言最多的地方，對於大東亞戰爭及世界戰爭有了謠言，就有揣測，我吿訴你們，戰爭和波浪一樣，我們坐在船眞。只有把定了舵，向着波浪奮力前進，不要自已搖動，如果聽一囘謠言。多一同揣測，物質上標金物價隨着波浪而起落，那心理上也　著波浪那樣而起落只是自尋怕　，大東亞戰爭是必勝的如果信了重慶方工的話，中國只有做印度，這是顚撲不破的事實，只有大東亞戰爭勝利，才保得住東亞，才保得住中國，這又是顚撲不破的事實，既然這樣，還有什麼懐疑之餘地？十幾年來，我對於中日事變，始終不願共發生，發生之後，如有好轉的機會，即願使之好轉，至少不願使之惡轉，對於大東亞戰爭，由同甘共苦進一步而為同生共死，這是一貫的精神，　是不易的方針，我們只有堅定信念，担當一切。信念既堅定了，就用得著勇猛精進刻苦耐勞以實現信念了，大東亞戰爭是必勝的，然不是倖勝的，中國參加大東亞戰爭，將因勝利之結果而得到解放，然勝利之結果，不是倖得的，全中國的人民，都要津備着上前綫去，現在第一步的工作還不過保障治安，增加生產，這第一步的工作，當然有許多困難，但是這些些困難，比起友邦前綫的將士，銃後的人民，我們只有慚愧之不暇，那裏用得着叫苦！我們必須認定，在這長期　中，那一國國民，能夠最耐得勞，最吃得苦，那一國國民纔是最後的勝利者，中國國民和。本國民，都是　勤勞儉樸著稱於世界，拿還勤勞儉樸的習慣，本於堅定的信念，以與英美個人享樂主義相周旋，大東亞戰爭的勝利，必然在我們掌握。</p>
<p>總結一句區，我們今日慶祝上海租界收囘，不是慶視中國獨立自主的完成，而　慶祝中國得此憑籍，可以發抓共力量，以實現　國父大亞洲主義之遺教，中國將因大東亞戰爭之勝利，得到自由平然，完成建設中華民國之志願。</p>
<h3>田尻公使詞</h3>
<p>日田尻公使在民衆大會致詞：友邦同志各位，過去阻止中國的獨立完整，和妨害樹立中日間的友好關係者，就是英美的　略東亞的野心和謀略，然而在束亞的英美勢力，一年半前已經由我們的力量趕出去了。</p>
<p>中國今天把那個英美侵略束亞的根據地的公共租界收同好了，在中國最恥辱的租界的歷史，就從今天起永遠消滅了。</p>
<p>從今天起，新上海的建設，就要開始了，包含日租界地城的新上海建設的歷史，從今天起就要展開了，如果新上海的經濟文化政治等各般建設工作，能夠圓滿的明期的發展的話，那麼新中國的建設，就可以說是一半完成了</p>
<p>如果新上海中日兩方人能夠眞眞的握手好了，加緊中日間的協力，就可以進一步的進展了。</p>
<p>再說，像如此的新上海的建設達成後，上海才可以分担打倒英美的責任</p>
<p>打倒英美要是專靠宣傳絕對做不到，非寶行不可，然而要達成這個目的，諸位應該多多的努力。</p>
<p>本人就希望完成新上海的建設，並且慶祝新中國將來的光輝的發展，本人就簡單的說幾句感想，以為祝辭。</p>
<p>今天本人以市長的地位，想對於上海的將來，對於諸位先生披露個人的期望，本人之演說今後對於上海市行政問題，以前的上海公共租界現在改為第一區，以前法國租界現在改為第八區，這兩區行政，為着將來行政效率起見，不久是要合併的，並且以往區域，因着兩租界的存在，尤其為着越界　路的關係，常有不合理的劃分，今後上海已無租界不租界之分，當重加調整，務使市中各區慢慢合平理想的分劃，至於治安方面，已經有三個單位，就是市政府的警察局，公共租界和法租界巡捕房，現在就原有單位，暫時分為三個警察局，就是第一符察局管轄第一區，第二警察局管轄市府以有的各區，第三警察局管轄第八區，然　第一和第五嗚　兩局不久也要合併的，這樣上海警　才可以統一，警力也可以加强，以後上海治安一定可以比從前更確立了，　然今日在剛　統一上海市政時期，遺有許多不自然事實的存在，要實現眞正理想的市政，還要俟諸將來，本人祇望上海的市政與大東亞戰爭與時俱進。</p>
<p>以前兩租界均有公董　的存在，而中國民間也有納稅會等的組織，雖然各個制度各有不同，本人認為市府應當重視人民的意見，因此打算在接收兩祖界之後，一切行政設施稍吿安定，即擬恢復臨時參議會，選聘社會有聲望有地位有幹才的人士，以備諮訽，務使人民對於市政有建議之權，俾上下一致，協助市政的進步。（餘略）</p>
<h3>褚外長演詞</h3>
<p>上海公共租界自從前年十二月八日大東亞戰爭　發生後，向來盤据的英美勢力一舉廓淸，而現在則更進一步將行政權交還　國，一方面自己犧牲了　大的利益，一方又代向開係各國折銜特旋，這種偉人的決心和崇高的友喧，完全是居於東亞道義精神的發揚，這一點是國人於感謝之餘，更加應深切認識的。</p>
<p>此外友邦注意二國也興友邦日本採取同樣措置，將上海公共租界的行政權交還我國，中法中意雖東西遠隔，但邦交素孚，而且在反英美的立塲上，更站在同一戰綫，這次基於友好的立塲，放棄粗界行政權，我們同樣的表示感謝。</p>
<p>我們為什麽在此地慶祝收囘租界？我們應該如何慶祝收同租界？我們不是空洞的慶祝無意義的歡吁，大家坐在這裏，每一個人心裏都會想起，百年前英帝國主義一手拿機關槍，一手拿鴉片槍，侵略我國的痛史，想起百五十年來英美帝國主義要在揚子江流城建立第二印度帝國的陰謀。</p>
<p>收回租界，事非容易，得到友邦的協助，才於短短五六個月內，完成收回租界，我們是參戰之一員，我國要總力參戰，司是我們盡了多少力量，我們不能不深切反省的，再就上海來說，過去影響於政治經濟軍事文化缺點劣點污點，必需一一敵底肅淸，事變以來於今七戰，戰亂的結果，造成物價高漲，生活艱苦的現象，遺是上海人所最感覺的苦悶的，然而如果我們放開跟睛，看看內地苦難的同胞，無米麥充饥，吃　根馬糞幾至於嬰孩，這裏呢，從前因為租界的存在，却是一餐一二萬金而不吝，都是由於英美侵略之流毒買辦階級所造成者，國民政府提出之「同甘共苦」「同生共死」的口號，這兩句口號是對全體同胞說的，要做到有苦同受，有甘同享，死則共死，生則同生、拿這種精神才能担負起復興中華保衛東亞的責任。</p>
<h3>中儲辦事處　變更名稱</h3>
<p>中央儲備銀行上海分行，因法租界已吿收回，故將該行法租界辦事處，變更名稱，改為甫區辦事處，所有以前簽發之存單，存據•契約•及簽字樣本，繼續有效。</p>

<h3>租界接收後　上海經濟與工商之推展</h3>
<p>上海公共租界與法租界經友邦日本某於中日緊密合作建設新東亞原則之下，業於七月世日及八月一日先後交道我政府接收，過去百年來受葵美經濟侵略之根據地，今始告完全剷除，一切行政已告統一，今後在政府管理之下，上海之假性繁榮由此當可趨於眞性繁榮，對於上海經濟與工商今後之推進展望，據中央社記者分訪各機關團　，探悉準備之動態如下：</p>
<p>調整金融</p>
<p>上海金融機關。（銀行錢莊信托公司）在過過租界特殊關係之下。棄亂不堪，組織系統頗不一致，其整個金融權威。多操縱英美商行之下，英商銀行管業恒咱吸其左右。而不能伸展本身業務。一遇發生政變，即受其播弄影響，政府不能直接管理，故整個金融隨時遭受　動。自大東亞戰後。政府中有管理金融機關辦法之實施。但迄今止租界區內金融　關。間有仍藉　　界牽制違搞　令。未遵章申請登記注冊之銀行錢莊以及信托公司。而繼續啓業者，依然存在。今　　已實施以收回管理金融機關辦法，已可無阻碍從事執行。中央儲備銀行檢查金融事務處。現正計劃嚴厲　締組織不合法之金融機關。如查有未經呈請登記注冊之金融機關，　予取締，停止營業，並依法送　司法機關徵處，一而　嚴予管理金融機關放未業務，防社投機者，利用放款資金，囤積物資，操縱市價，並確立保護人民資產利權去。</p>
<p>統五機構</p>
<p>上海商業機構組織，亦因租界關係，情形複雜，棄不健全，一旦政變囤積操縱行為，最易發生。自今年政府宣佈參戰，實施戰時經濟政策，設置商業統制總會，調整各業團體組織機構，賽施統制物資集中商人自治團體，採取物資統收統配制，機構雖已調整健全，惟因租界之牽制不能執行統制職權，故物價尚不能澈底抑止，尤其是投機者未盡消滅，現兩租界已實施收囘，商統前為統制機構一元化起見，決進行統一制機構，集中物資統制審議調查，三位為一體之管理，而使物資之增產，物價之抑制，物品之配給均能有合理之解決，商業自能趨於正常之繁榮，庶不負中日經濟提携平等互惠之厚望。</p>
<p>工業推展</p>
<p>滬市為工深重心區域，工廠林立社於全國，在事變以前，華商工廠多操特英美手中，乃因我國工業技術幼稚，故一切權利均落後，近數年來，友邦當局接營之英美工廠，及華中一帶之華高工廠，均已交還我國管理。現國府實施戰時經濟政策之步驟，着重於增加生產，充實戰時物實與經濟之需要，故推定工業，尤其上海工業為戰　最重要措施。今上海租界收回，欲振興大上海之建設，首以推展工業為前提。目前政府當局為積極的引導游資內移，投資農村增加生產，而以內地生產原料供給上海，工廠加緊製品之生產，以　物資之需要，則上海工商真正繁榮，當在中日　　　　平等互惠之實質上收獲最大之成效云。</p>
<h3>投機消滅</h3>
<p>復據本市經濟權威者之推想，上海最近數年來假性之繁榮，全係租界亞勢力所造成，擁資商民，不顧國計民生，藉租界之披護，違抗法令，囤積物資，　　居奇，操縱市價，雖經有關各當局嚴予取締終　難收效果，現租界收回後，法　嚴於我國政府，司法制度亦告統一，市政當局　能執行，法權嚴厲，取締非法營業，拘捕不法商民，依法　治，因當局執行管理職權之嚴密，預料投機行為，自形消滅，物價當能趨於穩定云。</p>
<h3>銀行限制提存　全屬無稽</h3>
<p>上週六恰値七底，本市盛傳八月一日起各銀行將有限制提存之謠，記者明知此租無稽傳說，不足措意，但為免除以訛傳訛淆亂聽聞起見，特於昨（三十一日）趨訪中央儲備銀行負資當局。承答以政府現在力謀穩定金融。　平物價之時。何來此舉，須知今昔悄勢逈異，如果限制提存，適足以引起金融之不安，刺激物價，故決無限制提存之事理極明顯云云。本日已有事實證明，市况安定如當，　次該言，行將自滅云。</p>

<h3>庫拉灣夜戰記</h3>
<p>在西南太平洋方面展開的日美海陸空立體決戰，正在B趨深刻熾烈中。八月四。五二日的庫拉　海戰，日本水電戰隊對該方面的美海軍予以重大打擊‘而在此後的敵方海上作戰上，發生了重大問題，値得大書特　。當時日本大本營會發表庫拉灣夜戰中日本水雷戰隊所獲的戰果計：擊沉桑泰號型乙級巡洋艦一，史屈　型大型驅遂艦一，艦型未詳乙級巡洋艦一，特務艦一，美國泰晤士報記者　頓推勒　從軍庫拉灣海戰，印載眩夜的激戰情况及美國最精鋭的乙級巡洋艦海倫那號的末日如次：</p>
<p>有物擋住去路</p>
<p>「是在七月五日午前一時起的二個小時中，我們的緼隊徐徐地向科隆班伽拉島洋面的東北方秘密進行，　海的黑夜，平靜的海面的天空上，美麗的繁星閃耀着，可是大家的心裏都感覺着在這靜穆的紫圍　後隱織着　　的殺氣。集然，在黑晴的彼方，有　然大物擋住我們的去路，那是B本海軍！仔細會時，像是一軍日本輕巡洋艦，「快要來了！」我們　隊中的任何一　，我們船員中每個人的胸中，恰如感到一　　電掠過一般的緊張。我們的艦隊漸漸地轉向與日本艦隊並打的方向。彼此的距離祗有〇〇米，然而日本軍緩好像沒有看見我們，不多一會事默默地進行着。</p>
<p>被擊中了</p>
<p>「被擊中了！」在艦橋上的人們，緊張的臉色打破了他們的自信。日本艦隊先動手了，被司令官開始戰鬥的號合所驚倒的人們，正在忽忙準備中，突然眼前爆裂的東西打破了黑夜的沉寂，發生懷烈火燄與炸聲，我們被捲入於驚險的海中了。艦身受到大震動，甲板上滿濺着詳血，記老起先摸不着頭腦，不知道發生什麼事，接着就明白了所乘的船巳被日人先下手擊中了。當初日本艦隊佯作不知，不動聲色的時候，其實正在瞞準發射　！</p>
<p>緊張的霎那間</p>
<p>日人更展開攻　武器的主力…魚雷．天地雲時問被包國在閃光，炸聲與火焰中。記者被砲火的閃光眩得眼花，　伙着均體，死命　住了艦橋的裝甲板。日　所發射的白白地一條條魚電的航跡，雖在黑夜也淸晰可見。信號兵石　了魚價的航跡，瘋狂般吹號報告，但艦身早巳沒有逃避的餘裕了。轟烈的炸聲中，正確地命中了我艦，機械室，彈藥庫，彈藥操作室，船艙內的兵員們，都被衝動得手足無措，記者閉上眼，心中默念看「完了」。雙方混戰一小時後，彼此的距離暫遠待我恢復憲識時，我艦在探照燈的光芒中，艦尾正在向海中沉沒下去。此時却又發見了另一艘軍艦。司令官立即命令驅遂艦急行調查，驅遂艦冒着日的砲火，用探海燈探照海面搜索，但報告遲遲不達，焦慮的司令官怒叫着：「他們在幹些什麼？」不久，報告來了，「是五〇號！」不用說得，這是我方新銳巡洋艦海倫那號的號碼。該　　命中魚雷數次，被迫不能行動，燃剩一片焦黑，殘剩的船員，乘筏先我們拾棄母艦。附近的海面，一時滿浮着，濃厚的油層，小筏在油的海面中浮沈掙扎着，離開正在下沈中的母艦。海倫那號像小說中的格立　巨人一梀，向海中沈沒，　上無數的附屬品則漂散海上。三艘　遂艦在其附近，在外側另有別艦担任　戒。　流大海中的船員們，點着燐火，舉手求救，其情况直如一幅地獄　。這時候從庫拉方面窮追而來的日水艦隊的影子，似漸趨迫近。我們不能不及早逃走。南海之夜，天曉較早，此地在日本某航空隊基地的制空　內，我們須得趕緊逃走尙殘剩着許多漂流待救得了，祇能聽其自然。被遺棄者之中海倫那號治亞島的人中，也有海倫那號艦長。（翔：譯自七月二十五日東京讀　報知阿根廷京城電）</p>
<h3>上海安老院參觀記　白髮紅顏　人間天上</h3>
<p>從南市崎嶇的市街，踏進上海安老院的緋紅的邊門，立刻出現另一世界，面積廣大的花園，吹來一陣淸芬的熏風，拂去你一身俗氛，感到無此的淸靜。小烏啁啾中，曳過一聲蟬歌，又顯出這裹充滿着活撥潑的生氣。誰不說這是人問的天堂。</p>
<p>安老院在南市外馬路機廢街被建勢起來，巳經是三十入年的往事了，熱心來華傳道行善的天主敎拯亡會（第四個來華的聖女會）在徐家匯聖母院辦過「老人院」，後來規模號大，完全獨立，成爲今日的安老院，南市一般人，如人力車夫等，至今還稱之爲「老人院」。</p>
<p>安老院的事業，在欲洲巳有一百多年的歷史，都由天主敎修女經辦扶養貧苦無告的男女老人。在中國，就只有這一個上海安老院，三十入年來，專爲扶養老人而服務，凡是貧窮無靠的老人，年請六十歲者，不分男女，不論是否信敎，都可入院，以安餘年，原定名額爲三百人，自從戰事爆發以後，上海孤苦無靠的老人太多了，不忍其婉轉待斃於街頭巷角，因此增加名額至三百五十人，爲着經濟力量有限，定額之外，就不能多收了，除非住院者有了死亡，才可「補缺」。</p>
<p>食堂裹的奇蹟</p>
<p>是夏天的下午五點鐘，恰好老人們進晚餐的時俟，四大間「食堂」巳告滿座，每一個　康的老人，自己從休息室或別的地方踱進食堂，找到規定給自己的座位，每人都有自己專用的餐具，大型飯碗，菜肴碗碟，調匙，筷子，和餐巾等等，裝在自巳專用的大抽屜裏。紅漆如新的大餐桌，長約十公尺，　坐各約十五人，顯得很　舒。在女食堂裏，還有用八仙桌的，她們也有各自專用的餐具，穿禮服的年青的練習姆姆，侍候着老人們，她們穿棱般家來去去，口邊掛着仁愛的笑，向這位點點頭，問那位「要添些不？」多親熱！誰家的媳婦有這麼孝敬，可是心寬體胖，食衆都不小，一吃兩「海碗」，看來很平常。米糧，從前除了各方而捐贈之外以外國捐助者爲主要來源，自從太平洋上戰起以來，巳告斷絕，存米吃完，就靠戶口米支持，可是，戶口米的數量常然離需要差得遠，不得不補充些雜糧和零買的社米，此外，安老院有兩位修女姆姆經常向上海市各界勸募些，全要的是各處菜塲，各大飯店，各總會，張羅食品，從前每天的收　頗有可觀，整箱的麵包餅乾，整隻的鷄鴨，以及魚肉蔬菜等，都有樂善者佈施，因此，老人每天所吃有華有素，口福不淺，但這巳是一年半載以前的往事了，現在各界生活很苦，尤以洋商爲甚，食品來源也一天天少了。但是記者還看到向沙利文募得的點心餅乾，以及從其他洋商食物店募到的麥糊乾菜，魚鮮等，經過調製後，倒也香味四溢，老人們咀嚼着津津有味。</p>
<p>廚房，這時開過晚飯，巳經整理得非常淸潔，運送飯菜的鐵車和銅銅，排列在走　邊。明天早餐需要的作料也已準備妥當了。究竟是在聖女姆姆主持之下，和別的男人管理的不同，這裏絲毫沒有什麼大餐館廚房那種令人不快的氣味，相反的，是着到了那鉅大驚人的爐灶之中西合璧的烹飪設備，洗刷得需亮的鍋子，以及正冒着熱氣的開水，樣樣引人好感，從此君子不必遠庖廚了。</p>
<h3>物價問題展望</h3>
<p>— 孝</p>
<p>物價一日不平，人心一日不安定，大多數勞苦羣衆不能安枕生活，因而影饗生產工作，因而影響社會秩序。戰爭的勝負，一半取決於沙塲上，一半取決於經濟社會。要博取軍事上的勝利，一定要兵精械足。要博取經濟上的勝利，首先要安定人民的經濟生活。所以，爲自己着想，爲社會着想，爲國家戰事着想，除了少數榨取階級和存心在混水裏撈魚的朋友之外，有誰願意物價上漲？有誰忍心物價上漲？</p>
<p>在戰爭的時候，誰丕知道生產困雖？誰不知道物資缺乏？這是戰時經濟上一個盡人皆知的重大缺昭。我們以岡家爲前提，應該設法來彌縫這個缺陷才是，怎麼可以利用這個機會來囤積物資博取暴利呢！如果說藉此發財的人，就算是有本傾的企業家，可以傲視一切，那末世界上的人，個個都是大金業家了！誰知實際上這種人，正是國家的罪人呢。如果說囤積是賺錢的唯一門徑，那未請問美國有名的三位大富翁！亨利福特·洛克菲爾·和加乃基·是否是靠囤積汽車，囤積煤油，或是囤積鋼鐵發財的呢？陶朱公大家知道是我國古代一位有名的財主，但歷史告訴我們。他所以致富的原因也並不靠囤預。</p>
<p>苒說囤積賺錢是否寶惠呢？我們的囘答是：並不實惠。因爲在商品社會裹，每個人都是商品所有者，就是一無所有的工人，也有他的商品（勞力）。你所有的商品漲價了，我所有的商品也可以漲價。米漲價了，生油也跟着漲價了，衣料也跟着漲信了，工人也跟着漲價了。大家漲價，等於不漲價。囤米者所賺的錢，被囤油的賺去了一些，又被囤布的賺去了一些，結果，仙所賺的餞仍被別人賺去了（就算有餘，也是無幾。</p>
<p>囤積賺錢的實惠倒沒有得到，因國稽而造成的經濟危機倒可能會發生的。什麼危機呢？那就是資本集中於國積而不去從事生產事業。生產愈　條，物資愈缺乏，結果，整個社便要發生物資恐慌和信用膨脹兩種危機。</p>
<p>總之，我們認爲抑平物價是順天應人的事情。不必在此多加討論。至於抑平的辦法，總合起來可以分爲三個：</p>
<p>第一是增加生產。</p>
<p>第二是維持通貨信用</p>
<p>第三是取締投繼囤績</p>
<p>從根本方面着想，常然只有第一第二兩個辦法才能使物價自然趨平。但根本辦法是不能馬上見效的，而且要資本集中生產。首須消減暴利機會。所以我們認爲現在要抑平物價，首先要實行第三個辦法。但是這個辦法，社會上主張的人也不少，政府的實施時間也不短，但何以至今還不能見效？何以至今物價還是不斷地上漲呢？這當然是另有原因的。我們會經說過：戰時利潤的畸形發展，只要政府權力所及，決不會讓它沒無止境地總續下去的，我們看了上海的物價悄形，不得不深深地感　政府的濟中心地，因此，我們覺得物價的至今不能抑平，也不得不歸責於政府權力的不及。</p>
<p>這是現在上海物價的實際狀態，也是整個物價的實際狀態。但這種狀態，是伴着租界的存在而存在的。現租界收囘，這種狀態自然會消滅了。此刻政府的權力，便可伸入這中國的經濟中心地。政府的抑平物價政策，是不會也不應變更的。但致策的實施方法，將來一定要有散底的政革。戰時物價，決不能任其自由發展，而抑平物價政策的實施，祇要政府發揮權力，堅持到底，一定能達到目的，等到暴利機會消滅了的時候，游資自然會跑向生產這條路上去的，那時，不單不會有游資找不着歸宿的現象，反而要感覺生產資本的不足。</p>

<p>— Yoshida Toyo</p>
<p>No matter how intense the situation of the Greater East Asia War may change, its outcome will always lead to the victory of Asia. I am fully optimistic about this point. Because I know that as long as Japan strikes at the aggression of Britain and the United States, and upholds the true Asian spirit, more than half of the world's population will surely become Japan's backing. The combination of Japan's material civilization and the entire Asian nation, which fervently hopes for liberation, will constitute an unprecedented great force in world history. Japan's material civilization is a special civilization developed on the basis of Asian production methods. If Asian nations do not seek liberation, it is fine, but if they seek liberation, they will inevitably adopt a special form of material civilization in the process of their liberation. In addition, the so-called Asian spirit does not only mean that Japan stands on the position of an Asian member - in fact, this point is great enough - but also the respective spirit of resistance developed in the history of Asian nations. In other words, the spirit often uses material wealth to resist the forces of external domination, and the spirit is a constant desire to maintain its own independence and freedom.</p>
<p>Asians observe their own spirit through the self-action of the spirit, and take grasping the common body as a lifelong profession. In the process, Asians confronted the material civilization of Europeans and developed a profound and mysterious spiritual civilization. When it comes to Asian spiritual civilization, one immediately thinks of Confucius and Lao Tzu in China, Buddhism in India, or Shinto in Japan. However, the characteristics of Asian spiritual civilization are not satisfied with these established things, and take these things as stepping stones to leap to higher places. While leaping, they abandon these kinds of stepping stones and constantly implement new progress. But in addition, the spiritual progress that is not bound by anything cannot be known by logical analysis, but is a state of intuition that can be grasped by experience. What exactly is this spiritual state? Here, I will give a few examples to illustrate it.</p>
<p>The famous Greek philosopher Diogenes (412 B.C. - 323 B.C.) was actually born in Sinope (a city on the Black Sea coast of Turkey) in Asia Minor. He was called "Barrel Sage" because he was poor and homeless, so he lived in a barrel by the road. At that time, there was Alexander the Great, who was brave and warlike and conquered a vast territory. Through the introduction of his friend Aristippus, he wished to meet with Diogenes. Diogenes, who often lived in Athens, wrote a letter in response to this request, saying that if he wished to meet, he would like Alexander the Great to come to his residence in person. Let us temporarily look at the full text of his letter:</p>
<p>"Aristippus! Having read your letter, I know that King Alexander of Macedon is very willing to see me. It is your own business to add the title of King of Macedon to Alexander (for example, no matter what the Macedonians are), but you know that I am not a subordinate of anyone. If Emperor Alexander wishes to know me and my life, then please come to my place. And I think that going from Athens to Macedon and coming from Macedon to Athens are the same distance."</p>
<p>He had no fear of the power of Alexander the Great, who conquered the world, nor any humble attitude. Regardless of everything, he still lived according to his own desires and according to what he believed in, the free spirit unbound by any object, and vividly expressed in this short letter.</p>
<p>Later, Emperor Alexander met Diogenes in Athens. After Alexander the Great saluted Diogenes, he asked, "What do you want?" Diogenes only said one sentence to this question: "Do not stand in front of me." At that time, Alexander, who held the wealth and power of the whole world, finally felt like a beggar in front of Diogenes.</p>
<p>This kind of true mountain spirit that is not affected by external objects transcends the problem of life and death. This spiritual state can be said to be the culmination of Japanese Bushido. Japanese Kendo is a means to achieve this state of mind. Therefore, Japanese Kendo focuses more on the state of mind than on skills. This is the difference between Kendo and foreign Fencing.</p>
<p>The protagonist Miyamoto Musashi in the Japanese film "Duel at Ichijoji Temple" shown at the Da Hwa Grand Theater the other day is not a fictional character, but one of the characters who realized this spiritual state through Kendo. One of his senior disciples, Terao Kyumanosuke, was a retainer of the Hosokawa clan. One day, Hosokawa Mitsunao, the lord of the Hosokawa clan, said to Miyamoto Musashi, what is the spirit that can be attained through Kendo that cannot be shaken by any external object (Miyamoto Musashi called it "the body of rock")? Miyamoto Musashi said, "Then I will show you this spirit in reality." After saying that, he immediately called Terao Kyumanosuke over. Miyamoto Musashi sat next to Hosokawa Mitsunao and said to Terao Kyumanosuke, "By the order of the lord, Terao Kyumanosuke is ordered to commit seppuku here and now." At that time, the order of the feudal lord was absolute, and the vassal had to obey absolutely in any situation. When Kyumanosuke heard this, he said without hesitation, "I obey the order, and will commit seppuku in the adjacent room." After performing the salute as usual, he calmly walked out of the room. From beginning to end, Kyumanosuke's demeanor did not change at all, completely no different from usual. Musashi said to Mitsunao, "The attitude of Kyumanosuke that you are seeing now is 'the body of rock'." Mitsunao was greatly moved and summoned Kyumanosuke back, greatly praising the spirit cultivated by the sword. The spirit that obtains true freedom is liberated from the fear of death, which is the state of "regarding death as returning home."</p>
<p>Confucius also often sought the free spirit of self-control. Therefore, he attached great importance to his disciple Yan Hui, who possessed this spirit. Now, let us excerpt a passage about Yan Hui from "Historical Records and Commentaries":</p>
<p>"Yan Hui was a native of Lu, styled Ziyuan, thirty years younger than Confucius. Yan Hui asked about benevolence, and Confucius said: 'To subdue oneself and return to propriety is benevolence to all under heaven.' Confucius said: 'How virtuous is Hui! A basket of rice, a ladle of water, living in a humble alley, others cannot bear its hardship, yet he does not change his joy. Hui is like a fool, but when he retires and examines his private life, he is also sufficient to develop it. Hui is not a fool. When he is employed, he acts; when he is dismissed, he hides. Only I and you have this virtue.'"</p>
<p>Although Yan Hui was advised by Confucius to go out and become an official, he rejected this idea and was willing to live on a basket of rice and a ladle of water. Of course, if he had real political power, he would have practiced his way, but at that time, the politics of the various countries were very chaotic, and there was really no possibility for him to practice his way. Therefore, people generally say that Yan Hui "does not change his joy in a humble alley." In fact, he likes and loves the independence of the spirit.</p>
<p>Confucius also talked about the personality of his disciple Zilu: "To wear tattered hemp clothes and not be ashamed to stand with those who wear fox fur robes, it is Zilu!" This sentence can also express Zilu's free spirit that is not affected by external objects. Later, Zilu died in battle during the civil strife in the state of Wei. Zilu's attitude at that time also showed a free spirit that transcended life and death. Regarding this record, let us look at "Historical Records and Commentaries":</p>

<h3>Administrative Power is Now Complete: A New Shanghai Begins. The Public Concession was Solemnly Received Yesterday.</h3>
<p>On the day that our country participated in the Greater East Asia War, our friendly nation Japan first declared the abolition of extraterritoriality, the return of the exclusive concessions, and the return of the administrative power of the Public Concession. It also cooperated with the diplomacy of the countries related to the Public Concession, and friendly countries successively made the same declaration and signed it. Japan's great goal was finally completed yesterday. The handover of the Public Concession was held in the auditorium of the Municipal Council at 10:00 am yesterday in a solemn reception ceremony.</p>

<p>Speech by Director-General Okazaki</p>
<p>Looking Forward to Further Administrative Progress in the Future</p>
<p>Your Excellency Mayor Chen: and everyone present: Today, we are undertaking this epoch-making and important mission in the history of the Shanghai Public Concession. From today onwards, the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council will be headed by Your Excellency Mayor Chen and will be renamed the First District Office of the Shanghai Special Municipality. I and my colleagues would like to say a few words here to express our infinite congratulations to Your Excellency Mayor Chen. Assisting the Republic of China in obtaining national freedom has been a long-standing wish of Japan. Today, China has completely restored the territorial and administrative rights of the Shanghai Public Concession, and it is our honor to participate in it. The spirit of friendship that has existed between China and Japan is aimed at common interests. Today, it is even more necessary for China and Japan to jointly undertake the construction of a new order in Greater East Asia. Japan and its allies are now working hard to manage the post-war work at this stage. For China to fulfill its mission in East Asia, the complete independence and freedom of all its territories and administration is an absolute prerequisite. At this time, it is with heartfelt admiration that a statesman with the vision and foresight of Shanghai Mayor Chen Gongbo is in charge of the administration. Since I took office as Director-General, I have felt that my talent is light and my responsibility is heavy. Fortunately, I have received full cooperation and understanding from all parties, so that I have been able to handle difficult municipal administration smoothly without failing. I must also express my gratitude to everyone.</p>
<p>In the past, due to various reasons, the administration we handled could not be strongly implemented in all aspects, or there were a few that had not been resolved. It is hoped that under the leadership of Mayor Chen in the future, these will be strongly completed in a unified manner and achieve satisfactory results. At the same time, we also expect to expand the current administrative efficiency in the future to adapt to the local situation, and then engage in the development of highly administrative efficiency, so that the new administrative organs of commercial cities will be able to take economic administrative measures further than the previous Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Shanghai has experienced various difficulties in the past, and today it has finally completed the unification of the entire Shanghai administration. In the future, it will certainly not only be the largest commercial city in China. I am convinced that it will gradually prosper and develop and become an industrial, cultural, and political center.</p>
<p>Finally, I thank all the guests for taking the time to attend, and I express my infinite gratitude for all the assistance and cooperation you have given me in the past.</p>
<p>Mayor Chen's Reply Correcting the System Must Be Carefully Considered</p>
<p>Director-General Okazaki: Ladies and gentlemen: On the day that China participated in the Greater East Asia War, Japan first declared the abolition of extraterritoriality, the return of the exclusive concessions, and the return of the administrative power of the Public Concession. Later, it cooperated with the National Government to work on the diplomacy of the countries related to the Public Concession, and the friendly countries successively made the same declaration and signed it. Japan's original great goal has finally been completed today. At the beginning of receiving the Public Concession today, we should express our gratitude to Japan and pay our respects to the countries concerned.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Director-General Okazaki and the Chinese and foreign directors and staff of the Municipal Council, especially the Japanese staff, have maintained Shanghai's prosperity and established Shanghai's security in difficult and precarious times, so that the Public Concession of today can be handed over to China in its entirety. Their perseverance and enthusiasm are especially admirable to me.</p>
<p>In the future, I can only continue your perseverance and enthusiasm in accordance with my personal duties, and maintain the efficiency of the original organs. Although the regulations of the Public Concession in the past were not entirely in line with China's system, I am deeply convinced that the people of the wood will carefully consider and handle them. In the future, even if there are revisions, we will take into account China's laws and regulations on the one hand, and the local reality on the other hand, so as to integrate the spirit and facts into one and complete the organization of a great Shanghai in the East. However, in any case, the administrative efficiency will never be reduced, which I am deeply confident in.</p>
<p>Although the Municipal Council has now been abolished, Director-General Okazaki and the directors are all in Shanghai. I will consult with them at any time in the future, and I will not fail to live up to your hard work and assistance. Moreover, all the staff of the various institutions under the old Municipal Council, except for those who have resigned, will be continuously hired and employed by me. In the future, I especially hope that the municipal administration of Great Shanghai will continue to improve, so that millions of Chinese and foreign citizens can coexist and prosper in Shanghai, and their happiness will increase day by day.</p>
<h3>The Task of the Preparatory Committee is Completed: Burma Declared Independence Yesterday.</h3>
<p>The Constituent Assembly Passes the Basic Law of National Organization. Ba Maw is the First National Representative and Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) Burma's administrative head, Ba Maw, accepted the announcement by General Kawabe, the supreme commander of the Japanese Army in the Japan-Burma area, on the 1st at 10:00 am, abolishing military administration and dissolving the administrative government. In view of the fact that the task of the Independence Preparatory Committee has been completed, the committee was dissolved, and a Constituent Assembly was convened for new independence procedures. Therefore, the Constituent Assembly immediately selected 25 members of the Independence Preparatory Committee as members and established it. It convened at 11:00 am and elected U Set Win as chairman. It first declared that the Assembly was a parliament representing the will of the people. Then, in the presence of General Kawabe and Japanese military personnel, Ba Maw solemnly declared the independence of Burma with a solemn demeanor at 11:30 am. Immediately afterwards, the basic law of the national organization drafted by the Independence Preparatory Committee was reviewed and unanimously approved. Before the Burmese national constitution is formulated, the basic law can be called the temporary constitution that regulates the operation of the Burmese nation. Finally, the General Assembly unanimously elected the head of the executive government, Ba Maw, as the national representative of the new Burma. Therefore, Ba Maw took office as the first national representative of Burma with the general will of all Burmese people. After taking office, he vowed to fulfill the responsibilities entrusted to him by the national representative in accordance with the above-mentioned basic law. At this point, the Constituent Assembly completed its epoch-making and important mission, and the dissolution was announced at noon. Burma completed its independence at this point and began to create the first page of a new history under the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) The national representative of the new Burmese nation announced the appointment of new cabinet ministers (15 ministers besides the prime minister) and advisors to the Privy Council (20 people) at 11:00 am on the 1st. The list of new cabinet members is as follows: Prime Minister Dr. Ba Maw, Deputy Prime Minister Takin Mya, Minister of Interior U Win, Minister of Foreign Affairs Takin Nu, Minister of Finance U Hla Min, Minister of National Defense Major General U Win, Minister of Taxation U Aye Lwin, Minister of Justice U Toe Yin Ye, Minister of Education U Hla Min, Minister of Agriculture Takin Chit Maung, Minister of Commerce and Industry U Mya, Minister of Communications Takin Thein Maung, Minister of Forestry U Hla Pe, Minister of Health and Propaganda U Set Win, Minister of Cooperation U Tun Win, and Minister of Public Works and Reconstruction Takin Lon Pe.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) After completing the independence procedures, the Burmese government issued a statement in the name of Foreign Minister Takin Nu to the foreign ministers of various Axis countries and neutral countries at 3:00 pm, declaring the independence of Burma. The countries to which the statement was issued include Japan, Germany, Italy, China, Manchuria, Thailand, Hungary, Spain, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, France, the Soviet Union, Turkey, and Finland.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Declaration: Recognition of Burmese Independence</h3>
<p>The Two Countries Also Conclude a Treaty of Alliance</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) The Japanese government issued the following statement on the 1st regarding the independence of Burma: On the 1st of this month, Burma declared independence and immediately declared war on Britain and the United States. The Empire immediately recognized the country and concluded a treaty of alliance with it, agreeing to cooperate closely to complete the Greater East Asia War and jointly build Greater East Asia. Looking back on Burma's suffering under British oppression for more than a hundred years, it has now achieved its long-cherished wish and gained the glory of independence. It has now risen up and stood with the Empire on the common front to defeat Britain and the United States. It is precisely the Empire's desire to eliminate the roots of a century of disaster in East Asia and build a new order based on the spirit of national founding that all nations obtain their place and all people live in peace. Therefore, it is deeply gratifying. Now, the State of Manchuria is exerting its national strength to cooperate with the Empire and carry out the war. The Republic of China and Thailand are also working to complete the common war under full cooperation with the Empire. At this time, the independence and rise of the State of Burma to participate in the great war has further strengthened the unity of Greater East Asia. The Empire and these countries will cooperate closely and echo the European allies to defeat the common enemy, Britain and the United States, and strive to build a new order of morality. Here, we specifically clarify the beliefs of the Imperial Government to both China and foreign countries.</p>
<p>Treaty Contents</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) The treaty of alliance between Japan and Burma stipulates the fundamental relationship between the two countries. The fundamental principle is to respect each other's independence and autonomy and build a new order of Greater East Asia based on morality to contribute to world peace. The contents of the treaty are as follows: Article 1: The government of the Empire of Japan and the government of Burma shall fully cooperate in military, political, and economic matters. Article 2: Japan and Burma shall cooperate closely for the common purpose of promoting the autonomous development of the countries of Greater East Asia and the prosperity of Greater East Asia. Article 3: Details of the implementation of this treaty shall be decided by the responsible officials of both countries as necessary. Article 4: This treaty shall be implemented from the date of signing.</p>
<h3>New Burmese National Flag Design</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) The new Burmese national flag has a yellow ribbon and three red stripes as the background, with a peacock with outstretched wings in the center. Its correct dimensions are five feet long and three feet wide. The yellow, green, and red ribbons, each one foot wide, are arranged vertically from top to bottom. A white circle with a radius of one inch is attached in the center, in which is a peacock.</p>
<h3>Wang, Concurrently Premier of the Executive Yuan, Sends a Telegram to Congratulate the Burmese Prime Minister</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Propaganda issued a joint communique at 7:00 pm on the 1st as follows: Burma formally declared independence on August 1st. President Wang of the Executive Yuan specially sent a telegram to Prime Minister Ba Maw to extend his congratulations. The telegram reads: "To His Excellency Prime Minister Ba Maw of the Burmese Cabinet: Upon receiving the telegram from Your Excellency's country announcing independence, the government of this country expresses its deep sympathy. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, your country has responded to Japan and eliminated the forces of British aggression. Now, as desired, you have obtained the glory of independence. Another independent country has joined the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the future is even brighter with mutual cooperation. The government of this country hereby recognizes Your Excellency's leadership of your government and expresses its congratulations. It is deeply believed that the friendly relations between the two countries will be even closer from now on. Wang Zhaoming, President of the National Government and Premier of the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China."</p>
<h3>Burma Enters State of War with Britain and America</h3>
<p>Ba Maw Announces at the Constituent Assembly</p>
<p>Rangoon, 1st (Central News Agency) - At 4:30 PM on the 1st, Burmese Prime Minister Ba Maw issued a proclamation after a meeting of the Constituent Assembly, reading a Burmese-language announcement stating that Burma had entered a state of war with Britain and America, effective immediately. Subsequently, at 4:45 PM in the same meeting room, he signed the Japan-Burma Alliance Treaty with Japanese Ambassador to Burma, Sawada. Burma's declaration of war against Britain and America prior to signing the Japan-Burma Treaty clearly demonstrates that the decision was made by Burma itself and was its own responsibility, as determined by Prime Minister Ba Maw after consulting with the Cabinet and Privy Council.</p>
<p>"Zigong was the magistrate of Kong Yu, a minister of the State of Wei. Kui Kui rebelled against Kong Yu and planned to enter Kong Yu's house. He then attacked Duke Chu with his followers, and Duke Chu fled to Lu. Kui Kui was then installed as the ruler, becoming Duke Zhuang. When Kong Yu rebelled, Zigong heard of it while he was outside and rushed back. He met Zigo at the gate of Wei City, who said to Zigong, 'Duke Chu has left, and the gate is closed. You should turn back to avoid suffering disaster in vain.' Zigong said, 'One who eats the food of another should not evade his difficulties.' Zigo then left. An envoy entered the city, and the city gate opened. Zigong followed him in. He went to Kui Kui. Kui Kui and Kong Yu ascended the platform. Zigong said, 'Why does the ruler need Kong Yu? Please allow me to kill him.' Kui Kui did not listen. Thereupon, Zigong wanted to set the platform on fire. Kui Kui was afraid and sent Shi Qi and Hu Ju down to attack Zigong, breaking Zigong's hat string. Zigong said, 'A gentleman dies, but his hat is not removed.' Then he tied his hat string and died."</p>
<p>Zigong's death was indeed as Zigo said, "suffering disaster in vain"; however, it was by no means such. Instead, it was in front of the spirit of freedom, transcending the concept of life and death, and there was an irrepressible free movement. Zigong simply acted according to this spirit. Confucius, who also grasped the samadhi state of the spirit of freedom, immediately predicted, "Alas! You is dead!" when he heard of the internal strife in Wei!</p>
<p>Yoshida Shōin—a Japanese advocate of expelling foreigners and revering the Emperor—wanted to go abroad on a foreign ship but was arrested by the shogunate and beheaded. Before his execution, he sang loudly without regard for others: "Although I know it will be this way, there is a sacred and inviolable Yamato spirit." The true spirit of freedom has the characteristics of disregarding any interests and having an irrepressible impulse. This is somewhat different from the spirit of Europeans. When the tyrant Nero massacred Christians in Rome, the Apostle Peter first fled from Rome. On the way, he blamed himself for leaving so many Christians behind, escaping alone. At that moment, he saw the shadow of Christ going to Rome in the sky. The Apostle Peter asked Christ, "Master, where are you going? *Que Vadis Domine*." Christ replied, "I am going to Rome for you." So Peter returned to Rome and went to Nero's cross. If this were Terao Kyūma-no-suke, Zigong, or Yoshida Shōin, they would not have needed to ask, "Master, where are you going?" They would have long regarded death as returning home and accepted the death penalty. With a calm mind, able to go from life to death—when the heart is cold, the fire is not hot—this is the spirit of freedom of Eastern people. The Japanese troops who died in action on Attu Island and Guadalcanal were mostly Japanese farmers, various clerks, or ordinary people. However, none of these people were captured by the enemy, and they fought to the last person and the last drop of blood. This proves the great existence of the "Asian spirit." Comparing this with the spirit of Europeans makes it very clear. In the Asian spirit, from beginning to end, there is no calculation of success or failure, because Asians know that when they should die, they die. This is the actual expression of life, the only way for the spirit to survive forever.</p>
<p>This spirit, during the Greater East Asia War, was for Britain and America, an incomprehensible, truly Asian psychological Great Wall of Japan. However, this psychological Great Wall is not unique to the Japanese. If it were unique to the Japanese, the future of the Greater East Asia War would not be optimistic. The reason why I am optimistic about the Greater East Asia War is because I believe that China and Japan have this shared spirit of freedom, that Asian people inherently have this shared spirit of freedom. If Japan can revitalize this Asian spirit, if it can arm this Asian spirit with Japanese material civilization, then no matter how intense and cruel the situation of the Greater East Asia War may be temporarily, the arrival of final victory is beyond doubt. Assuming that all Japanese can understand that this spirit of freedom also exists among the Chinese, I believe that full peace can be achieved immediately. Assuming that Japan has a spirit of freedom that transcends interests, and China also has a spirit of freedom that transcends interests, then the Sino-Japanese War will never continue with each side holding weapons without end. This is a very simple theory. (Translated from Chinese)</p>
<p>Postscript: The Sunday Commentary, originally scheduled to be published yesterday, was postponed to today due to the publication of a special edition celebrating the recovery of the concessions.</p>
<h3>New Prospects for Burmese Independence - Remarks by Propaganda Minister Lin</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Burma was liberated. With the assistance of Japan, it declared its independence yesterday (August 1st). Propaganda Minister Lin made the following remarks on this occasion:</p>
<p>Complete Liberation of East Asia</p>
<p>"Today—August 1st, the 32nd year of the Republic of China—is the day of the final success of China's recovery of the concessions. It is also the day of Burma's independence, marking an epoch-making milestone on the road to the liberation of East Asia. The former demonstrates China's brightness, while the latter proves that the ranks safeguarding East Asia are becoming increasingly solid. Both events were completed at a time of victory in the Greater East Asia War, with the joint assistance of the friendly nation of Japan. This truly proves that the independence and freedom of East Asian countries and the complete liberation of East Asia are inseparable. All Chinese and East Asians, on this great and memorable day, while sharing in the deep celebration, should further increase their sense of responsibility, and with a spirit of advancement, take on this epoch-making mission.</p>
<p>Relationship with China</p>
<p>The historical relationship between Burma and China is very deep and long-standing, and their geographical relationship is also like lips and teeth. After India was annexed by British aggression, Burma unfortunately fell under its colonial rule. Britain then used this as a further step to invade China. The mutual safety and shared pain of both countries are self-evident. Therefore, Chinese revolutionary comrades have always been extremely concerned about the Burmese issue. In the past, the Burmese national liberation movement has undergone three major bloodsheds and countless struggles, and Chinese revolutionary comrades have especially extended boundless sympathy to this. When the official news of Burma's independence was announced, the excitement of the Chinese government and people further increased their expectations for the Burmese nation in the future, and further gave them new prospects for the future of East Asia.</p>
<p>Significance of the National Bloc</p>
<p>First: The Burmese nation's demand for independence has been brewing for a long time, manifested in fierce actions, and not just for a day. Why was it only realized after the Greater East Asia War? This shows that as the world's political and economic development has reached the stage of national blocism, the acquisition and guarantee of a nation's independence and freedom not only takes the simple national self-consciousness as its intension, but must also take the national bloc's self-consciousness as its extension. The independence of Burma cannot precede the liberation of East Asia and must be sought within the liberation of East Asia.</p>
<p>The tendency of facts does not allow us to ignore it. All East Asian nations, in light of China's recovery of the concessions and Burma's independence, will naturally know how to make choices for their own destiny, and will certainly generate greater vigor and make greater efforts. After independence, Burma will certainly be able to closely cooperate with the friendly nation of Japan and work hand in hand with our country for the future of Burma and the common destiny of East Asia.</p>
<p>The Fruit of Sincere Unity</p>
<p>Second: In the past, British and American aggressors recklessly slaughtered the general weak nations without any scruples. After the outbreak of the European War and the Greater East Asia War, they became increasingly anxious about their own safety and used the so-called Atlantic Charter to carry out the final deception on the long-oppressed nations. Their intentions are clear. The friendly nation of Japan stands at the forefront of the Greater East Asia War and is the advanced country of East Asia. It does not need to be bound by any false charters or use empty words as a sign. However, Tojo's repeated statements and the factual performance following these statements are more sincere and powerful than any charter. This is our observation of Burma's independence, and it is also our understanding of Shanghai's recovery of concessions. We firmly believe that East Asian nations must seek unity with sincerity, seek victory in the Greater East Asia War with unity, and seek the common existence and co-prosperity of East Asian nations with this victory.</p>
<p>Prelude to Indian Independence</p>
<p>Third: The impact of Burma's independence is not only for Burma itself but is also of great importance to the future of the liberation of Greater East Asia. We can say that Burma's independence is actually the prelude to Indian independence. The Indian compatriots, who have long been trampled on by British imperialism, will inevitably become more and more determined to fight a final and decisive battle with British imperialism with the assistance of the friendly nation of Japan, so that the last piece of land on the road to the liberation of Greater East Asia can be returned to East Asia, and Indian compatriots can regain their freedom.</p>
<p>On this day of Burma's independence, I would like to wish Burma prosperity with the greatest enthusiasm, wish victory in the Greater East Asia War, and wish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere limitless development.</p>

<h3>Inauguration of Chen, Concurrent Head of the First District Public Office, Who Also Assumes Office as Head of the First Police Bureau - The Whole City Hangs Flags to Celebrate the Recovery of the Concessions</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai International Settlement was taken over by personnel dispatched by the National Government, it was incorporated into the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, and the First District Public Office and the First Police Bureau were established. The posts of Head of the Office and Head of the Bureau have been concurrently assumed by Mayor Chen, appointed by the National Government. After the completion of the handover ceremony of the International Settlement, Chen, concurrently the Head of the Office and Head of the Bureau, immediately led Chief Secretary Wu Songju, Deputy Head Su Chengde, and other senior officials to hold an inauguration ceremony. The ceremony was simple and solemn. After the ceremony, Chen, concurrently the Head of the Office and Head of the Bureau, delivered the following speech:</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen: Today, I am ordered to concurrently serve as the Head of the First District Public Office and the Head of the First Police Bureau of the Greater Shanghai Special Municipality. I am very pleased to have my first conversation with you at the time of my inauguration. You have all served in the International Settlement for many years and have made outstanding contributions, especially after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. You have worked hard to maintain the municipal administration of the Shanghai International Settlement and to ensure its continuous development. I would like to thank you all first. In the future, although the International Settlement has been changed to the First District, I hope to maintain the effectiveness of the administration with your efforts and even enhance its effectiveness. I deeply hope that you will base your service on your virtue of being dutiful and impartial and give me your assistance. As for the Chinese and foreign staff, except for those who voluntarily resign, all will continue to serve in their positions. This is something you all know. Regarding treatment such as annual salary and retirement benefits, they will be based on the original regulations. Even if there are reasonable revisions in accordance with Chinese laws in the future, they will only be improvements and will never cause you any regrets. This is what I dare to assert today. Many Japanese employees of the former Shanghai Municipal Council, and the number of newly added Japanese employees since December 8, the year before last, is not small. In recent years, the progress of the facilities in the International Settlement has been particularly outstanding. In the future, I hope that you will continue to serve the Greater Shanghai Municipal Government with the spirit of being dedicated and devoted to your country. China and Japan share life and death in the Greater East Asia War, and their cooperation is seamless. Shanghai, in the rear, is no less important than the front line. Chinese and Japanese employees should cooperate sincerely to achieve the victory of the Greater East Asia War as soon as possible. This is what I deeply hope for. After the speech, the ceremony was completed with music.</p>

<h3>Reflections on the Return of the Shanghai International Settlement: Broadcast Address by Japanese Minister Tajiri One Evening in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shanghai International Settlement was officially returned to China yesterday (the 1st). Especially appointed Minister Plenipotentiary Tajiri Aigi delivered a broadcast address on Shanghai Radio from 9:00 PM to 9:15 PM on the 1st, entitled "Reflections on the Return of the Shanghai International Settlement." He provided a detailed explanation of the true significance of returning the concessions. The content of Minister Tajiri's speech is divided as follows:</p>
<p>A Great Undertaking in Chinese History</p>
<p>The administration of the Shanghai International Settlement was officially returned to China at 9:30 AM today in a solemn and grand ceremony, and was received by the First District Public Office of the Shanghai Municipal Government. Furthermore, the French Concession was returned to China on the previous day (the 30th), thereby permanently ending the administrative power of the concessions in Shanghai. The return of the Shanghai International Settlement to China is not only the completion of the most important element of Chinese sovereignty but also a groundbreaking undertaking in Chinese history. The first day of August can truly be called a day worthy of eternal commemoration by China.</p>
<p>Eliminating the Final Page of British and American Influence</p>
<p>Since the Opium War, the Shanghai International Settlement has been the largest vanguard base for British and American aggression in East Asia for a century. The British and American nations repeatedly used the name of the Shanghai Municipal Council or the related League of Nations to prevent China's unification and development, obstruct Sino-Japanese cooperation, invade East Asia, and disrupt peace, exhausting their ambition. The number of their crimes is countless. This history of British and American concession crimes is also due to Japan's initiation of the Greater East Asia War and the elimination of British and American influence in China, bringing it to a final page. In the year and a half that followed, due to the maintenance of public order and the necessities of the war, the final handling of the concession issue was not immediately seen. Now, based on the righteousness of East Asia, Japan swiftly returns the Shanghai International Settlement, a trace of British and American crimes, to China. At the same time, the new China is bravely advancing toward the completion of its construction as a modern nation. Japan is truly deeply moved by this and sees it as highly meaningful.</p>
<p>Fundamental Policy of Returning Concessions</p>
<p>Japan has already liberated the Greater East Asia region from the shackles of British and American politics. Now, it is taking a further step to actively build a new order in Greater East Asia. Japan's just and enthusiastic assistance to the independence of Burma and the Philippines, the participation of Javanese people in administration, Thailand's recovery of lost territories, and the independence movements that are being celebrated, is truly sufficient to demonstrate Japan's fundamental policy regarding the construction of political, economic, cultural, and other orders for the various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia. At the same time, this return of the concessions is also a part of Japan's fundamental policy and is being implemented accordingly. Therefore, the return of the concessions cannot be observed solely from the perspective of Sino-Japanese relations.</p>
<p>Ignoring the Significance is a Misunderstanding</p>
<p>The Empire and China should be the core of building a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. There is no need to state this more clearly. The Empire is striving to promote the independence and completion of the new China, build a thriving continent, and establish a new relationship of Sino-Japanese cooperation. From the grand ideal of Hakkō ichiu (Eight Corners of the World Under One Roof), the development and prosperity of the new China is not only a matter of course but also a prerequisite for the construction of Greater East Asia. The formation of the Sino-Japanese axis is the core for establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere. The return of the concessions is the first step in this process and has extremely great significance. However, many Chinese people are blinded by immediate interests and believe that this return of the concessions is merely a political game, tending to overlook its far-reaching significance. This is truly a very great misunderstanding and the result of being swayed by enemy propaganda. One must know that without the livelihood of an independent and complete people, the livelihood of a colony and the life of a beggar are essentially no different. Furthermore, if one honestly observes the new direction of world history unfolded after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and the process of its realization, then the old order of Britain and America is indeed full of flaws. On the other hand, the liberation and construction of Greater East Asia is now gaining the approval and cooperation of the billion people of Greater East Asia. This fact cannot be ignored. Among them, the only ones who continue to collude with the old dominance of the United States and Britain and continue the futile resistance war, compared to the National Government, which is dedicated to the prosperity of Greater East Asia and the construction of the new China, it is extremely clear which one is truly advancing in the direction commanded by world history. The return of the concessions is by no means a political means to propagate and strengthen the National Government but is one aspect of the Empire's righteous diplomacy with the aim of the prosperity of Greater East Asia and the cooperation in building the new China. The Chinese people should accept it with complete sincerity and without any selfish motives, and by honestly and wholeheartedly cooperating with the National Government, they will be truly loving China. Moreover, since China is already at war with Britain and America, those who truly love China must gladly adhere to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's advocated Pan-Asianism, and without fear of sacrifice, boldly aim at rescuing and building Greater East Asia, establishing a total war wartime system in all aspects, and building a new state that is the core of the new order in Greater East Asia. The entire nation, both government and people, must unanimously move forward in this direction.</p>
<p>Starting Point for Building a New China</p>
<p>Furthermore, observing the management of the concessions after their return, the relationship to the construction of the new China is extremely important. This is because the concessions, which have always hindered China's development, will henceforth become the starting point for building a modern nation in all aspects, including political, economic, and cultural. The construction of the new China does not end with the formal and complete return of sovereignty over the concessions. Taking Shanghai as an example, the politics of Shanghai, with the municipal government at the core surrounding the former concessions, must move further forward. The grand task of integrating Shanghai's economy with other regions must also be completed. In particular, the British and American ideologies that have entrenched themselves in the Shanghai concessions for years and hindered China's prosperity have not yet been eradicated, and China's inherent ideology has not yet been restored. Therefore, this opportunity should not be missed, and efforts should be made to eradicate British and American ideology. Building a new Shanghai after the return of the concessions is truly a major task and responsibility entrusted to the people of Shanghai. Today's Shanghai truly needs the spirit of the Xinhai Revolution of thirty-two years ago and the efforts of blood. The National Government authorities and the leading and youth levels of Shanghai have now happily encountered an opportunity to rise up. If there is a lack of such rising up, sacrifice, and effort, then discussing participation in the war is completely meaningless. In order to make the return of the concessions a successful result, there is no other way to advance. Regarding the construction of the new Shanghai, Japan will not hesitate to provide goodwill support. When flipping through the historical pages from the Meiji Restoration to the First Chinese Revolution, and then to the liberation of East Asia, it can be seen that it is truly full of lofty reform ideas. Japanese people, especially the Japanese living in China, should grasp this original meaning and cooperate in building Shanghai. The efforts of the blood and sweat of the Chinese people, coupled with the cooperation of the Japanese, will lead to the completion of the new Shanghai. In this way, the victory and glory of the Greater East Asia War can be shared by the newly reborn Shanghai. Japanese residents should also deeply feel the greatness of their responsibility and respond to this situation with extraordinary determination.</p>
<p>Mayor Chen Will Exchange Broadcasts With Tokyo Governor Tonight</p>
<p>The Shanghai French Concession and International Settlement have been successively returned to China by our country. Shanghai Special Municipality Mayor Chen Gongbo expressed his infinite gratitude and joy for the cooperation of the friendly nation of Japan and specifically arranged to exchange broadcasts with Tokyo Governor Ōkai Shigeo from 10:10 AM to 10:35 AM on the 2nd on the Shanghai Radio.

<p>Chairman Wang's Address</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality held a "Celebration Assembly of People's Representatives to Celebrate the Return of the Concessions" at 4:00 PM this afternoon (the 1st). National Government Chairman Wang personally delivered an address, the original text of which is recorded below: What I wanted to say has already been said in today's broadcast. Now, I will only add a few sentences. On April 26 of the 29th year of the Republic [1940], when the National Government was celebrating the return of the capital, I published an essay, "The Spirit of Self-Reproach." What is most needed during a celebration is self-examination and self-encouragement. Now, as I participate in this assembly to celebrate Shanghai's return to the "coarse boundary" [concessions], I still hold this spirit of self-reproach. Why did China have concessions? On the one hand, it was the aggression of Britain and America. On the other hand, it was our inability to resist the aggression of Britain and America. We cannot but blame ourselves for this point. Why did Shanghai have concessions? It was because a group of people, shouting loudly, such as Zeng Wenzheng [Zeng Guofan] and Li Wenzhong [Li Hongzhang], in order to fight against the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, did not hesitate to seek assistance from the British foreign gun squads, and thus used the Shanghai concessions as a reward. We cannot but blame ourselves even more for this point. Since Shanghai had concessions, although there were also passionate movements to reclaim the concessions, there were also people who regarded the concessions as a comfortable nest. We cannot but blame ourselves for this point. This time, the return of the concessions was not due to our own strength, but due to the assistance of the friendly nation of Japan. As we look back on the past, face the present, and look forward to the future, we can only examine ourselves and encourage ourselves. I also have very painful words. In May of the 28th year of the Republic [1939], I arrived in Shanghai to preside over the peace, anti-communism, and national building movement. At that time, if Chongqing had adopted my proposal, then when the European War occurred, China and Japan would have been able to cooperate wholeheartedly and deal with it calmly. Why did it have to be delayed until today? Even if that were not the case, as long as the compatriots in the two Shanghai concessions could adopt my proposal and work together, then when the Greater East Asia War occurred, Shanghai would have already had three years of organization and training. It would have been able to cooperate wholeheartedly and deal with the situation. It would have exerted a great force in the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, the lives of the people of Shanghai, such as the instability of prices today, etc., could have been reduced by at least two-thirds. Why is there such a situation today? When looking back on the past, there is only heartache. We should still face the present and look forward to the future and encourage ourselves well. Do the Shanghai compatriots still have doubts about the victory of the Greater East Asia War? Shanghai is the place with the most rumors. With rumors about the Greater East Asia War and the world war, there are speculations. I tell you that war is like waves. We are sitting in a boat. We can only hold on to the rudder and move forward through the waves. Do not shake ourselves. If you listen to a rumor and speculate more, the material gold and prices will rise and fall with the waves, and psychologically you will rise and fall with the waves. You are just looking for fear. The Greater East Asia War is bound to be won. If you believe the words of the Chongqing side, China can only be like India. This is an unbreakable fact. Only the victory of the Greater East Asia War can protect East Asia and protect China. This is also an unbreakable fact. Since this is the case, what room is left for doubt? For more than ten years, I have always been unwilling for the Sino-Japanese Incident to occur. After it occurred, if there was an opportunity for improvement, I would like to improve it, at least not to make it worse. For the Greater East Asia War, from sharing joys and sorrows to sharing life and death, this is a consistent spirit and an immutable policy. We can only strengthen our beliefs and take on everything. Once the belief is firm, we can use courage, diligence, perseverance, and hard work to realize the belief. The Greater East Asia War is bound to be won, but it is not a lucky victory. China's participation in the Greater East Asia War will be liberated as a result of victory, but the result of victory is not obtained by luck. All the people of China must be prepared to go to the front line. The first step of the work is still to ensure public order and increase production. These first steps of the work certainly have many difficulties, but these difficulties, compared to the soldiers on the front line and the people behind the lines of the friendly nations, we only have time to feel ashamed. Where do we need to complain? We must recognize that in this long war, the nation that can endure the most labor and endure the most suffering is the nation that will ultimately be victorious. The Chinese and Japanese people are both known for their diligence and frugality in the world. Take the habit of diligence and frugality, based on firm beliefs, to deal with the Anglo-American hedonism, and the victory of the Greater East Asia War is bound to be in our hands.</p>
<p>In summary, today we celebrate the return of the Shanghai concessions, not to celebrate the completion of China's independent autonomy, but to celebrate that China has gained this basis to unleash its joint forces to realize the legacy of the Father of the Nation's Pan-Asianism. China will gain freedom and peace as a result of the victory of the Greater East Asia War and fulfill the aspirations of building the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Minister Tajiri's Speech</h3>
<p>Japanese Minister Tajiri said to the audience at the People's Assembly: Comrades of the friendly nation, in the past, what hindered the independence and integrity of China and obstructed the establishment of friendly relations between China and Japan was the aggressive ambition and strategy of Britain and America in East Asia. However, the British and American forces in East Asia were driven out by our forces a year and a half ago.</p>
<p>Today, China has recovered the public concession, the base of British and American aggression in East Asia. From today, the history of the most humiliating concessions in China will be forever eliminated.</p>
<p>From today, the construction of the new Shanghai will begin. The history of the construction of the new Shanghai, including the Japanese concession area, will begin from today. If the various construction works of the new Shanghai, such as economy, culture, and politics, can develop smoothly and brightly, then the construction of the new China can be said to be half completed.</p>
<p>If the Chinese and Japanese people in the new Shanghai can truly shake hands and strengthen cooperation between China and Japan, then further progress can be made.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the construction of the new Shanghai is achieved in this way, Shanghai can share the responsibility of defeating Britain and America.</p>
<p>Defeating Britain and America cannot be achieved solely through propaganda; it must be put into practice. However, to achieve this goal, you should make more efforts.</p>
<p>I hope to complete the construction of the new Shanghai and celebrate the future brilliant development of the new China. I will simply say a few words of thought as a congratulatory speech.</p>
<p>Today, in my position as mayor, I would like to disclose my personal expectations for the future of Shanghai and for all of you. My speech will address the administrative issues of Shanghai. The former Shanghai International Settlement is now renamed the First District, and the former French Concession is now renamed the Eighth District. For the sake of future administrative efficiency, these two districts will soon be merged. Furthermore, in the past, the zoning of the region was often unreasonably divided due to the existence of the two concessions, especially due to the relationship of the cross-border roads. In the future, Shanghai will no longer have the distinction of concessions and non-concessions. It should be re-adjusted to make the districts in the city gradually conform to the ideal zoning. As for public order, there are already three units, namely the police bureau of the municipal government, the public concession, and the French concession patrol rooms. Now, based on the original units, they are temporarily divided into three police bureaus, namely the First Police Bureau, which governs the First District, the Second Police Bureau, which governs the districts already under the city government, and the Third Police Bureau, which governs the Eighth District. However, the First and Fifth [sic] bureaus will also be merged soon. In this way, Shanghai's police forces can be unified and the police force can be strengthened. In the future, Shanghai's public order will definitely be more established than before. However, today, in the early stages of unifying the Shanghai municipal administration, there are still many unnatural facts. To achieve a truly ideal municipal administration, it will have to wait for the future. I only hope that Shanghai's municipal administration will advance with the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>In the past, both concessions had public directorates, and there were also organizations such as taxpayers' associations among the Chinese people. Although the various systems are different, I believe that the municipal government should value the opinions of the people. Therefore, after taking over the two ancestral boundaries, once all administrative facilities are slightly stabilized, I plan to restore the Provisional Council, selecting and employing people with prestige, status, and ability in the community to provide consultations, so that the people have the right to make suggestions on municipal administration, so that the upper and lower levels are consistent and assist in the progress of the municipal administration. (Rest omitted)</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Chu's Address</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War on December 8 of the year before last [1941], the British and American forces that had always been entrenched in the Shanghai International Settlement were swept away in one fell swoop. And now, further, the administrative power is returned to China. On the one hand, Japan sacrifices great interests. On the other hand, it serves as a special envoy to persuade the countries concerned. This great man's determination and lofty friendship are entirely based on the promotion of the spirit of East Asian morality. This point is something that the people of the country should deeply recognize in addition to gratitude.</p>
<p>In addition, the friendly nation also pays attention to the fact that the friendly nation of Japan is taking the same measures to return the administrative power of the Shanghai International Settlement to our country. Although China and France and China and Italy are far apart from each other, their diplomatic relations have always been trusted, and they are standing on the same front in the anti-British and American position. This time, based on a friendly position, we also express our gratitude for giving up the administrative power of the coarse boundary.</p>
<p>Why are we celebrating the return of the concessions here? How should we celebrate the return of the concessions? We are not celebrating emptiness or meaningless cries. Everyone sitting here will think of the painful history of British imperialism invading our country with machine guns in one hand and opium guns in the other a hundred years ago, and the conspiracy of British and American imperialism to build a second Indian empire in the Yangtze River basin for one hundred and fifty years.</p>
<p>It is not easy to recover the concessions. We have been able to complete the recovery of the concessions in just five or six months with the help of friendly countries. We are members of the war. Our country must participate in the war with total force. How much strength have we exerted? We cannot but deeply reflect. Furthermore, looking at Shanghai, the shortcomings, disadvantages, and stains that have influenced politics, economy, military affairs, and culture in the past must be thoroughly eliminated one by one. Since the incident, there have been seven battles so far. The result of the war has created a phenomenon of rising prices and difficult living conditions, which is the most felt suffering by the people of Shanghai. However, if we open our eyes and look at the suffering compatriots in the interior, who have no rice or wheat to fill their hunger and eat the roots and horse manure until the infants die, and here, in the past, because of the existence of the concessions, we were lavish with meals costing 10,000 or 20,000 gold coins, all of which were caused by the buying-class poison of British and American aggression. The National Government's slogans of "sharing joys and sorrows" and "sharing life and death" are addressed to all compatriots. Only by sharing suffering, sharing sweetness, dying together, and living together can we assume the responsibility of reviving China and defending East Asia.</p>
<h3>Change of Name of the Central Reserve Bank Office</h3>

<h3>Celebrating the Reclaiming of Concession Areas with a Charity Football Match: Three Provinces vs. Western Union, Today at 6 PM at the Recreation Ground</h3>
<p>The Three Provinces Sports and Youth Association is hosting two charity football matches to celebrate the reclaiming of the concession areas. Three Provinces will play against Western Union at the Recreation Ground on Albert Road. The grand opening is scheduled for 6 PM today. The second match is scheduled for the 6th (Friday). To highlight the grand occasion, the organizers have invited Foreign Minister Chu Minyi to deliver the opening speech, Mayor Chen Gongbo to perform the opening kick, and Miss Zhou, the daughter of Finance Minister Zhou, to present the awards. Tickets are priced at twenty yuan and fifty yuan. All proceeds, after deducting expenses, will be donated to the Shen Bao and Xin Bao Scholarship Funds.

<p>A Small Football Interlude</p>
<p>Featuring Three Provinces versus Saint John's. Saint John's has an outstanding record in the President’s Cup, while Three Provinces is renowned for its dominance in Shanghai. Their encounter will be just as exciting as the main match. Over the years, Western Union has assembled the elite forces of St. Francis and Portugal. Their fierce energy at the Xuhui field a few days ago still lingers in the minds of fans, and the sharpness of their five forwards has been praised. With the return of the central defense line, the tightness of the defensive line, and the agility of goalkeeper G. Su Shi, they demonstrate limitless attacking and defensive power. As for</p>
<p>The Three Provinces Tiger Formation</p>
<p>Although a newly emerging force, it has recruited first-class famous players from the Tung Wah and Lianyi teams, such as Dai Xiaojing, Jia Youliang, Sun Jinshun, Wu Qixiang, Li Tiansheng, and Qu Yongfu. With the foundation of Xuhui, their fighting strength is even stronger. They have absorbed the best of English talent, making them a truly powerful team, confident enough to compete with any team. However, Western Union's full force should not be underestimated. With their long experience on the field, seasoned tactics, and cunning style, they are like nine-tailed foxes. Fortunately, Three Provinces has a strong force and high morale, capable of matching the ferocity of tigers. Today's encounter of evenly matched opponents will undoubtedly be exciting. It is expected that the Recreation Ground will be packed with spectators. The referee is Shen Huichun, with linesmen Chen Jixiang and Huang Renyi. The lineups are as follows:</p>
<p>Three Provinces: Gao Lianjun, Lian Junzhi, Li Tiansheng, Wen Xingqi, Wu Qixiang, Yongfu, Song, Saint Myerson, Zhuang Wenquan, Zhou Defa, Sun Mianshun, Xiaojing, Gao Baozheng, Chunhua, Jia Youliang</p>

<h3>The Promotion of Shanghai's Economy and Industry After the Reclaiming of Concession Areas</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession have been handed over to our government on July and August 1st respectively, through the close cooperation of friendly nation Japan under the principle of constructing a New East Asia. The bases of American economic aggression for the past century have now been completely eliminated, and all administration has been unified. Under the government's management, Shanghai's false prosperity can now move towards genuine prosperity. Regarding the future promotion of Shanghai's economy and industry, a reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed various organizations and learned of the preparations underway, as follows:</p>
<p>Adjusting Finance</p>
<p>Shanghai's financial institutions (banks, money shops, trust companies) were in disarray due to the special relationship with the former concession areas. Their organizational systems were inconsistent, and the entire financial authority was largely controlled by British and American commercial firms. British banks controlled their operations, preventing them from expanding their own businesses. In the event of political changes, they were manipulated and influenced, and the government could not directly manage them, causing the entire financial system to suffer turbulence. After the Greater East Asia War, the government implemented measures to manage financial institutions. However, even until now, some financial institutions in the concession areas, still relying on the concessions, violated regulations and failed to apply for registration, continuing to operate. Now that the reclaiming of the concessions has been implemented, there are no obstacles to enforcing the management of financial institutions. The Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank is planning to strictly scrutinize illegal financial institutions. Any financial institutions found to have failed to apply for registration will be shut down, their operations suspended, and they will be handed over to judicial authorities for prosecution. Financial institutions will be strictly managed to prevent speculators from using loans to hoard goods and manipulate market prices, and to protect the rights and interests of the people's assets.</p>
<p>Unifying Institutions</p>
<p>Shanghai's commercial organizations are also complex and unsound due to the concession areas. In the event of political changes, hoarding and manipulation are prone to occur. Since the government announced its participation in the war this year and implemented wartime economic policies, the General Association for Commercial Control was established to adjust the organizational structures of various trade associations. Measures were implemented to centralize the control of materials and organize self-governing merchant groups, adopting a system of unified collection and distribution of materials. Although the organizational structure has been adjusted and improved, the control could not be fully enforced due to the constraints of the concession areas. As a result, prices could not be thoroughly suppressed, and speculators were not completely eliminated. Now that the two concession areas have been reclaimed, in order to unify the control institutions, the Commercial Control will unify the organizational structure, centralize material control, and integrate deliberation, investigation, and management, so that the increase in production, the suppression of prices, and the distribution of goods can all be reasonably resolved. Commerce will naturally move towards normal prosperity, living up to the hope of economic cooperation between China and Japan on an equal and mutually beneficial basis.</p>
<p>Promoting Industry</p>
<p>Shanghai is a key industrial area, with factories throughout the country. Before the incident, Chinese factories were mostly controlled by British and American firms, due to the immaturity of China's industrial technology. As a result, all rights were lagging behind. In recent years, British and American factories operated by friendly nation authorities, as well as Chinese factories in Central China, have been returned to Chinese management. The National Government's current steps in implementing wartime economic policy emphasize increasing production and meeting the material and economic needs of wartime. Therefore, promoting industry, especially Shanghai's industry, is the most important wartime measure. Now that the Shanghai concession areas have been reclaimed, the first priority in revitalizing the construction of Greater Shanghai is to promote industry. Currently, the government authorities are actively guiding the inward transfer of floating capital, investing in rural areas to increase production, and using raw materials produced in the interior to supply Shanghai. Factories are stepping up the production of products to meet the needs of material. Then, Shanghai's genuine economic and industrial prosperity will reap the greatest benefits from the substance of equal and mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Japan.</p>
<h3>Eliminating Speculation</h3>
<p>Furthermore, according to the speculation of economic authorities in this city, the false prosperity of Shanghai in recent years has been entirely created by the power of the concession areas. Merchants and civilians with capital, disregarding national welfare and the people's livelihood, violated laws and regulations by hoarding goods, speculating and profiteering, and manipulating market prices under the protection of the concession areas. Although the relevant authorities have strictly taken actions to ban it, it is ultimately difficult to achieve the desired effect. Now that the concession areas have been reclaimed, the laws are stricter than in our government, the judicial system has also been unified, and the municipal authorities are able to enforce the laws with severity. The authorities' strict enforcement of management duties is expected to eliminate speculative behavior and stabilize prices.</p>
<h3>Bank Restrictions on Withdrawals Are Completely Groundless</h3>
<p>Last Saturday coincided with the end of July, and rumors were rampant in the city that banks would restrict withdrawals starting August 1st. The reporter knew that this rumor was groundless and not worth paying attention to, but in order to avoid the spread of misinformation and confusion, the reporter visited the responsible authorities of the Central Reserve Bank yesterday (July 31st). They replied that the government is currently striving to stabilize finance and stabilize prices. There is no reason for such a move. It should be known that the current situation is completely different from the past. If withdrawals were restricted, it would only cause financial unrest and stimulate prices. Therefore, there is absolutely no reason to restrict withdrawals, which is very clear. Today, the facts have proven that the market is as stable as it should be, and the rumors will die out on their own.</p>

<h3>Night Battle of Kula Gulf</h3>
<p>The three-dimensional naval, land, and air battle between Japan and the United States unfolding in the Southwest Pacific is becoming increasingly intense and fierce. In the Kula Gulf naval battle of August 4th and 5th, the Japanese Naval Water Minesweeping Force inflicted a major blow on the U.S. Navy in that area. Since then, a major problem has arisen in the enemy's maritime operations, which deserves special attention. At the time, the Japanese General Headquarters announced the results of the Kula Gulf night battle, in which the Japanese water mine warfare unit sank one USS Helena-class light cruiser, one USS Fletcher-class destroyer, one light cruiser of unknown class, and one auxiliary ship. American Thames Newspaper reporter Dun Tuile reported from the Kula Gulf naval battle, printing the details of the dazzling night battle and the demise of America's most elite light cruiser, the USS Helena, as follows:</p>
<p>Something Blocking the Way</p>
<p>"For two hours starting at 1:00 AM on July 5th, our fleet slowly and secretly proceeded northeastward on the sea off Kolombangara Island. In the black night, the beautiful stars shone in the sky above the calm sea. But everyone felt that hidden behind this solemn atmosphere was an impending danger. Suddenly, in the blackness, a huge object blocked our path. It was the Japanese Navy! Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be a squadron of Japanese light cruisers. 'They're coming!' Every member of our squadron, every member of our crew, felt a jolt of electricity run through their chests. Our fleet gradually turned in a direction parallel to the Japanese fleet. The distance between us was only 100 meters, but the Japanese seemed not to see us, and continued silently on their way."</p>
<p>Hit</p>
<p>"Hit!" The tense faces of those on the bridge shattered their confidence. The Japanese fleet struck first. As the men, startled by the commander's order to begin battle, were hurriedly preparing, something suddenly exploded before their eyes, breaking the silence of the night with fierce flames and explosions. We were plunged into a perilous sea. The ship's hull shuddered violently, and the deck was splattered with blood. At first, the reporter was confused, not knowing what had happened. Then, he realized that the ship he was on had been struck first by the Japanese! When the Japanese fleet pretended not to notice us, remaining still and silent, they were actually aiming to fire!</p>
<p>A Moment of Tension</p>
<p>The Japanese then launched their main offensive weapon: torpedoes. Heaven and earth were engulfed in flashes, explosions, and flames. The reporter was blinded by the flashes of the artillery fire, and, along with his comrades, desperately clung to the armored plates of the bridge. The trajectories of the white torpedoes fired by the Japanese were clearly visible even in the darkness. A signalman spotted the trajectory of a torpedo and frantically blew his horn to warn of it, but the ship had no room to maneuver. In a deafening explosion, the torpedo accurately struck our ship. The engine room, ammunition depot, ammunition handling room, and the crew inside the cabins were all thrown into chaos. The reporter closed his eyes, silently thinking, "This is it." After an hour of fierce fighting, the distance between us temporarily widened. When I regained consciousness, I saw that the stern of our ship was sinking into the sea under the glare of searchlights. At this time, another warship was spotted. The commander immediately ordered a destroyer to rush to investigate. The destroyer braved the Japanese artillery fire and used searchlights to search the sea, but the report was delayed. The anxious commander shouted angrily, "What are they doing?" Soon, the report came: "It's Number 50!" Needless to say, this was the number of our new cruiser, the USS Helena. She had been hit by several torpedoes, rendering her unable to move. Burning fiercely, only charred remains were left. The surviving crew abandoned the mother ship on rafts before we did. For a while, the nearby sea was covered with a thick layer of oil, and the small rafts struggled to stay afloat in the oily sea, moving away from the sinking mother ship. The USS Helena, like a Gulliver from a novel, sank into the sea, and countless accessories floated on the surface. Three destroyers were nearby, and other ships were stationed on the outside to provide vigilance. The crew members adrift in the vast ocean lit phosphorus fires and raised their hands for help. The scene was like a picture of hell. At this moment, the shadows of the Japanese naval fleet chasing from the Kula area seemed to be approaching. We had to escape as soon as possible. In the South Sea night, dawn comes early. In the airspace controlled by the Japanese air force base, we had to escape quickly. There were many survivors still drifting in the sea, waiting to be rescued, but we could only leave them to their fate. Among those abandoned, there was also the captain of the USS Helena, from Georgia. (Sho: Translated from the Tokyo-based Houchi Shimbun, Argentinian Kyongsong dispatch, July 25)</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Shanghai Old People's Home: White Hair and Rosy Cheeks, Heaven on Earth</h3>
<p>Stepping through the crimson side gate of the Shanghai Old People's Home from the rugged streets of Nanshi, you immediately enter another world. In the vast garden, a fragrant breeze blows, washing away the dust of the secular world and making you feel incredibly peaceful. Amidst the chirping of small birds, the song of a cicada drifts by, revealing that this place is full of lively vitality. Who wouldn't say this is heaven on earth?</p>
<p>The Old People's Home was built on Jifei Street on the outer Ma Road in Nanshi, and it has been thirty years since then. The zealous Catholic Society of the Holy Redeemer (the fourth congregation of women saints to come to China), which had been doing missionary and charitable work in China, ran an "Old People's Home" at the Xujiahui Mother Mary's Church. Later, it expanded in scale and became completely independent, becoming the Old People's Home of today. The general public in Nanshi, such as rickshaw pullers, still call it the "Old People's Home."</p>
<p>The Old People's Home movement has a history of over a hundred years in Europe, and it is run by Catholic nuns who support poor and helpless elderly men and women. In China, there is only this one Shanghai Old People's Home. For thirty years, it has been dedicated to serving the elderly. Any poor and helpless elderly person, male or female, aged sixty or older, can be admitted to the home, regardless of whether they are religious or not, to live out their remaining years. The original quota was 300 people, but since the outbreak of the war, there have been too many lonely and helpless elderly people in Shanghai. Unable to bear to see them slowly die in the streets and alleys, the quota was increased to 350 people. Due to limited financial resources, no more could be admitted beyond the quota, unless a resident died, in which case a "replacement" could be made.</p>
<p>A Miracle in the Dining Hall</p>
<p>It was 5:00 PM on a summer afternoon, just as the elderly were having dinner. The four large "dining halls" were full. Every healthy elderly person walked from their rest room or elsewhere to the dining hall and found their assigned seat. Each person had their own personal tableware, including a large rice bowl, dishes for the dishes, a spoon, chopsticks, and a napkin, all stored in their own personal drawer. The large dining tables, freshly painted red, were about ten meters long and seated about fifteen people each, appearing very comfortable. In the women's dining hall, there were also square tables for eight people, and they also had their own personal tableware. Young trainee nuns in uniforms served the elderly, moving back and forth like shuttles, with kind smiles on their faces, nodding to this person and asking that person, "Would you like some more?" How intimate! What daughter-in-law is so filial? However, they were broad in mind and body, and their appetites were not small. Eating two "large bowls" was very common. Rice and grains used to come mainly from foreign donors in addition to donations from various parties. Since the outbreak of the war in the Pacific, this supply has been cut off. After the rice supply was exhausted, they relied on household registration rice for support. However, the amount of household registration rice was often far from meeting the needs, and they had to supplement it with some mixed grains and retail rice. In addition, two nuns from the Old People's Home regularly solicited donations from all walks of life in Shanghai, mainly from various vegetable markets, large hotels, and various general associations, looking for food. In the past, the daily intake was quite considerable, with whole boxes of bread and biscuits, whole chickens and ducks, as well as fish, meat, and vegetables being donated by philanthropists. As a result, the elderly ate well every day, with both vegetarian and meat dishes, and were very fortunate. But this was a year and a half ago. Now, life is very difficult in all circles, especially for foreign merchants, and food sources are becoming less and less abundant. But the reporter still saw snacks and biscuits donated by Sullivan, as well as wheat porridge, dried vegetables, and seafood donated from other foreign food stores. After being prepared, they smelled delicious, and the elderly chewed on them with relish.</p>
<p>The kitchen, after dinner was over at this time, had been cleaned very thoroughly. Iron carts and brass carts for transporting food were lined up along the corridor. The ingredients needed for tomorrow's breakfast were also prepared. After all, under the leadership of the nuns, it was different from being managed by other men. There was not the unpleasant smell of a large restaurant kitchen at all. On the contrary, the huge and impressive Sino-Western cooking equipment in the stove, the shiny pots and pans, and the steaming hot water were all pleasing. From this, a gentleman need not stay far from the kitchen.</p>
<h3>Prospects for the Price Problem</h3>
<p>— Xiao</p>
<p>If prices are not stable for one day, people's hearts will not be at peace for one day. The majority of the working masses cannot sleep soundly, which affects production and work, which in turn affects social order. The outcome of a war depends half on the battlefield and half on the economy and society. To win a military victory, one must have well-equipped and well-trained soldiers. To win an economic victory, one must first stabilize the people's economic lives. Therefore, for the sake of oneself, for the sake of society, and for the sake of the country's war effort, apart from a few exploitative classes and those who deliberately fish in troubled waters, who would want prices to rise? Who would have the heart for prices to rise?</p>
<p>In times of war, who does not know that production is difficult? Who does not know that there is a shortage of materials? This is a well-known major deficiency in the wartime economy. Taking the country as a premise, we should find ways to make up for this deficiency. How can we use this opportunity to hoard materials and seek exorbitant profits! If those who get rich by this means think that even if they are established entrepreneurs, they can look down on everything, then everyone in the world would be a major capitalist! Who knows that in reality, such people are the criminals of the country. If hoarding is said to be the only way to make money, then may I ask, the three famous American tycoons, Henry Ford, Rockefeller, and Carnegie, did they get rich by hoarding cars, hoarding kerosene, or hoarding steel? Tao Zhugong, as everyone knows, was a famous wealthy man in ancient China, but history tells us that the reason he became rich was not by hoarding.</p>
<p>Furthermore, is hoarding to make money really beneficial? Our answer is: it is not beneficial. Because in a commodity society, everyone is a commodity owner. Even a worker who has nothing has his commodity (labor). If the price of your commodity rises, the price of my commodity can also rise. If the price of rice rises, the price of sesame oil will also rise, the price of clothing will also rise, and the wages of workers will also rise. Everyone raising prices is equivalent to not raising prices. The money earned by the rice hoarder is taken away by the oil hoarder, and then taken away by the cloth hoarder. As a result, the money earned by Xian is still earned by others (even if there is a surplus, it is negligible).</p>
<p>The benefit of making money by hoarding is not obtained, but the economic crisis caused by hoarding may occur. What crisis? That is, capital is concentrated in hoarding and does not go to engage in production. The less production, the more scarce the materials, and as a result, the entire society will experience two crises: a material panic and a credit inflation.</p>
<p>In short, we believe that suppressing and stabilizing prices is something that conforms to the will of Heaven and the hearts of the people. There is no need to discuss it further here. As for the methods of suppression and stabilization, they can be summarized into three:</p>
<p>First, increase production.</p>
<p>Second, maintain currency credit.</p>
<p>Third, crack down on speculation and hoarding.</p>
<p>From a fundamental point of view, naturally only the first and second methods can make prices naturally stabilize. But fundamental methods cannot take effect immediately, and to concentrate capital on production, we must first reduce opportunities for excessive profits. Therefore, we believe that to suppress and stabilize prices now, we must first implement the third method. However, there are many people in society who advocate this method, and the government has been implementing it for a long time, but why is it still not effective? Why are prices still rising? There must be other reasons for this. We once said: As long as the power of the government is within reach, it will never allow the abnormal development of wartime profits to continue indefinitely. We have seen the price situation in Shanghai, and we cannot help but deeply feel the government's economic center. Therefore, we feel that the fact that prices have not been suppressed and stabilized to this day must also be attributed to the government's lack of power.</p>
<p>This is the actual state of prices in Shanghai now, and it is also the actual state of prices as a whole. But this state exists with the existence of the concession areas. Now that the concession areas have been reclaimed, this state will naturally disappear. At this moment, the power of the government can extend into this economic center of China. The government's policy of suppressing and stabilizing prices will not and should not be changed. But the implementation methods of this policy will definitely have a thorough reform in the future. Wartime prices must not be allowed to develop freely, and as long as the government exerts its power and persists to the end, it will definitely achieve the goal of implementing the policy of suppressing and stabilizing prices. When the opportunity for excessive profits disappears, floating capital will naturally run to the path of production. At that time, not only will there not be a phenomenon of floating capital not finding a place to go, but there will instead be a feeling of insufficient production capital.</p>
