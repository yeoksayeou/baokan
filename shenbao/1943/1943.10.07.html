<p>社評</p>
<h3>現實政治與人民要求</h3>
<p>現在到處可以看到和聽到「加强中日協力」「爭取大東亞戰爭勝利」的口號和標語，當然，這些都是對的，而且都是我們今天所應努力的最大目標。不過，如果要求眞實做到，決不是喊喊寫寫了事，而首先必須檢討一下現實政治，只有現實政治是向這一方面發展的，是有助於加强中日協力與有助於爭取大東亞戰爭勝利的，那麼才有實際的效果可言，否則，如果忽視現實政治而高唱口號，不免一切落空。</p>
<p>現實政治的檢討，當然也不是可以輕下斷言的。第一，要把握住時間性，時間是無情的，它替人類反映出一幅最眞實的活動的圖畫，無論怎樣善於修飾，總逃不過時間的者騐，時間也是最現實的，往往一種政治，在某一時期可稱爲滴當的，在另一時期就不適當，也有在彼一時爲秕政者，在此一時或可稱善政。因此，我們檢討現實政治，必須注重時間性。第二耍把握住空間性，也就是地理國情和民族的殊異性，因爲往往有在甲國可以暢行收效的，在乙國或不免成爲　格不人的。在甲地爲適應人民要求的政治，在乙地或徒增人民的疾苦而難求實際效果。第三，還要把握住國際性，因爲現在的戰爭以及戰後的新秩序建設，不僅在一國爲總力之戰，而且在國際上也是全體主義的戰爭，要求集合各國之總力以爭取共同目標之實現，所以，我們在檢討現實政治時，徒知本國一時之便利而忽視全　共同的利益，自然也不能獲得正確的結論。除了上述三大原則之外，當然，我們在檢討時還必須　對遵守論事不論人，重事實不用情感的基本原則。否則不免「差之　釐，謬以千里」了。</p>
<p>根據上述原則，我們試一檢討和平地區的現實政治，最顯而易見的，似乎存在如下幾種缺陷。在精神方面，現在和平區政府中人，對於和平運動最後成功抱有堅定信念的人士固然不少，但缺乏正確之信念的，說老實話，究占最大多數。他們大多抱著一種錯誤的觀念，以為現在和平區內的政治局面，決不是長久的，不久的將來，又將另有一番變遷。由這種錯誤觀念出發，表現爲事實的是：㈠對於自己的責任，認識不淸，以爲只不過聊以糊口，完全只爲個人生活着想，因此缺乏責任心。㈡對於職務有「五日京兆」的心理，上焉者「但求無過，不求有功」，下焉者抱定鬼混主義，過一天算一天。㈢對於前途既無信念，而且只為個人的利害打算，便不免利用職權營私舞弊。所以，我們敢於斷言，和平成功的信念不立，則決不能求政治修明，而政治不修明，則一切國策便落了空。</p>
<p>其次，專家政治與廉潔政治，是一國政治上軌道的前提，而國民政府也一向在這一方面努力促其實現的，然而，就幾年來的事實而言，除了部分的現象之外，大體上還不能盡符理想，不寗唯是，而且還有相反的事實呢！就專家政治一點而言，老實說，目前和平區內，大多數懷有眞才實學索孚人望的，沒有參加政治，如果完全　調此輩人士成見太深不肯參加，我們實在不敢相信。而相反方面，我們看到只要可以　緣，只要善於投機，便不愁無官可作，於是政府中　入一般不學無術之輩，上焉者造成官僚主義的政治風氣，爲政治不能進步的主要因素，下焉者目不免散播市井習氣，以善於營私爲榮，以權詐多變爲智。而另一更大的原因，則爲一般公務人員所受薪倅，不足以養廉，人非盡爲聖賢，乃以聖賢所不能者用實望，日言肅清食汚厲行廉潔，又有何用？</p>
<p>積極性的政治設施，爲國家政治上軌道的基本要素，所以把握人心，所以吸納專才，所以實現國策，都有賴於此。然而試一回顧和平區內近數年來的現實政治，其可稱爲積極性的建設性的政治設施者，究有多少？固然，爲了國際及國內戰爭的存在，爲了各地特殊情形之存在，我們未能對政府作過苛的要求，然而從全部政治設施的比重來說，究以消極性的設施占絕對大額，而積極性的設施則幾乎沒有什麽重大的地位。對於人民心理及國策推行，往往受到重大影響。</p>
<p>現實政治的缺憾，往往造成政府與人民之間的隔閡，阻礙了國策的推行。人民的要求本來很簡單，第一，也是最主要的，是實現安居樂業。所謂安居樂業，決不是要求享受，只在要求政治上軌道，有良好的政治，人民最低限度的生活有保障，工作與事業可以正常的進行。第二，是要求當局特別重視生產事業；爲了戰爭，人民固然不能不遵守一切管制與約束，但是史重嬰的却是要求物資的增加，首先是要求生產事業的發展，道不僅是改善民生的前提，而且也是改善政治貫澈國策的前提。第三，一向人民處於純粹被治的地位，對於政治旣無參預之權，且無置喙餘地。今日人民固然不想在戰爭期內實現憲政，但是如何實現地方自治，如何樹立民意機構，如何使人民與政府保持密切的聯系，進而造成「官民一體」的新氣　，却是今日共同的要求。</p>
<p>時至今日，國際時局與國家現實，都不需要任何高談闊論，只要求重視現實政治，改善現實政治，滿足人民要求。因爲只有如此，才能實現政府與人民的協力，才能實現集中國力，才能要求國策的貫澈，也才講得到加强中日協力爭取大東亞戰爭勝利。</p>

<h3>日對太平洋戰局　已整備有利態勢　襲波根維爾敵機擊落九架</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城六日中央社電　據倫敦來電，英情報部次長薩特爾，五日出席此間密林戰展覽會開幕典禮時，就太平洋戰局之前途談稱：太平洋方面現戰鬥方酣，反軸心軍必須由日方之手將廣泛之熱帶地域奪囘。但此實非易舉，　日軍已佔據廣大之地域，且於經濟與戰略方面皆已整備有利之體勢，故反軸心軍欲奪囘此等地域，即用全力以赴，亦難望成功。</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　據南太平洋某基地電，南太平洋敵空軍，於四日實以統一式B24型重轟炸機，BA33長距離水上哨戒攔擊機，P38　P40　F4w等　戰鬥轟炸機五十八架聯合編隊，來襲波根維爾島東部日軍陣地。日　戰鬥機　即予以猛烈反擊，當　落敵P38型五架，E4w型機一架，B24型機三架，共計九架（內有二架未證實），是役日軍亦喪失飛機一架，但該機飛行員全部獲救。</p>
<p>阿根廷六日中央社電　據芝加哥來電，美戰綫視　團昌江特勒於返華　頓　次，便道　芝加哥時曾接見記者團，指出太平洋戰爭有陷於長期戰之處，大旨謂：美國此時若不調遣充分援軍開始總攻馬加撒，則日軍戰綫將日益　　，而太平洋戰爭有陷於長期戰之處。但英國對太平洋戰綫美軍不但不予以充分援助，且無意在中國及緬甸戰綫開始攻勢。苟英國再作延宕，則美國不能不代替英軍開始進攻。江特勒對歐洲戰局亦論及，略謂：反軸心軍欲從法海岸侵入歐洲，實不可能。</p>
<h3>日軍在廣德附近　展開殲滅戰　五湖日軍獲莫大戰果</h3>
<p>南京六日中央社電　日軍各精銳部隊，現於太湖地區對渝方「忠義救國軍」展開包圍殲滅戰，佔領渝軍根據地廣德後，其殘部隊均陷入包圍綱，現以三州山北麓爲中心，到處展開計烈之殲滅戰，三萬渝軍之命運，已危在旦夕。日軍快速部隊於二日夜佔領廣德後，即於三四兩日掃蕩該地附近殘敝，澈底覆滅渝方軍事設施，其他各部隊自北方及太湖西方前進，將渝方挺進第二隊吳俟安及第四隊之一部完全包圍。四日晨起目東方地區向南方壓縮包　圈，予敵以潰滅打擊。另一部隊於三日到達廣德南側，四日轉鋒繼續猛攻，當日下午包圍某地之渝軍，完成包圍　之外廊包圍陣，刻正展開激烈之殲滅戰。又一部隊與次相呼應，迫至廣德背後，掃蕩「忠義救國軍」總指揮部所在地王領（廣德南方十五公里）及龍口村（廣德南方八公里）附近地區，渝軍遭日軍多方面之包圍作戰，已成袋中之鼠，極爲狼狽。</p>
<p>中國前綫某地六日中央社電　日軍精銳各部隊前在五湖地帶團擊渝忠義救國軍三萬人，復於五日繼　壓縮包　圈，到處　殲殘敗渝軍，分別予以各個擊被，尤以攻陷廣德之日軍快速部隊，更急追敵軍，曾占領泗安鎭，又由蕪湖方面進擊上沛埠附近之日軍部隊，刻正進剿伺機發動之新四軍第十六旅之一部，日軍某一部正在溧陽剿　中，故五湖地帶將隨日軍作戰之進展而　明良朗化。</p>
<p>南京六日中央社電　據江南日軍前綫訉，日軍於五湖地帶展開之新作戰，今巳　最高潮，渝軍重要根據地廣德已被佔領，此次作戰，對新中國之建設上，頗多　獻，國府政治因此得以伸展，淸鄉工作亦得促進，並獲得資源，實値得注目。按揚子江下游地區之治安，由於過去國府之淸鄉工作，及日軍不斷實施肅淸戰，得以維持良好狀况，但渝軍仍不時乘隙從事謀略課報工作，邇來其行動，日益活躍，因附近一帶農民之生活頗趨不安，致有阻害國府政治力伸展之勢，但由於此次作戰，致該等蠢動地帶，全被肅淸，此後掦子江下游地區之治安，卽將急速恢復，五湖地帶民生之安定，良堪期待。同時國府於浙省實施之淸鄉工作，因此次作戰，亦可迅速進展，又該地一帶之資源農產物爲米麥棉等，皆爲華中最富饒之地，故此後食糧物資之補給，實堪期待，此外物資之流通，亦漸趨活躍。且該地帶鐵煤之蘊藏量，亦頗豐富，故此次之作戰地帶，不久即將爲戰時下中日兩國之資源寶庫，此次作職之收穫，　莫大焉。</p>
<h3>海南島日軍　上月戰果</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日海軍部隊對在海南島蠢動之　軍殘部刻仍繼續掃落中，九月份所獲戰果如左：渝軍　屍三八五具，被俘一〇六七人，日軍鹵獲機槍一九五支，手槍五一支，彈二一二二發，手溜彈二〇四個，並擊沉渝軍帆船計四五艘。</p>
<h3>吳凱聲任　外部次長</h3>
<p>南京六日中央社電　國民政府令，十月六日，任命吳凱聲爲外交部次長，此令，任命徐文祺爲行政院秘書，此令。</p>
<h3>德經濟使團長　訪日滿要人</h3>
<p>新京六日中央社電　德經濟使節團長比爾達特，五日抵此後，六日上午分訪梅津關東軍司令官。張國務總理。及滿外交經濟興農各部大臣，幷謁中央銀行總裁，正午復田席德公使館之宴會。</p>

<h3>宣部組織　赴滿記者團</h3>
<p>南京六日中央社電　國民政府宣傳部爲聯絡中滿兩國新聞記者之情感起見，特組織中國記者赴滿考察團，全團八人，首都二人，上海二人，武漢一人，廣州一人，江蘇一人，安徽一人，人選業經決定，最近即行出發，在滿除與新聞界聯歡外，並考察全滿各地重要建設，，文化經濟，各項　施事業，預定兩週後返國。</p>
<h3>首都靑少年　籌備運動會</h3>
<p>南京六日中央社電　國慶紀念首都靑少年運動大會　備委員會，連日來加緊工作，　備大會一切事宜，大會各項比賽哉判人員，業巳分別聘定，均爲首都體育專家。又聞各校前往大會　會報名參加競賽者甚爲踴躍，預料屆時定有一番盛况。</p>
<h3>義武官聲明　效命新政府</h3>
<p>南京六日中央社電　義國駐華大使館武官比林齊比尼，對巴特里奥政權背盟之屈服，深爲痛恨，同時並於接獲墨索里尼新政府樹立消息後，當卽致墨索里尼統帥表明決心誓爲法西斯共和黨效命而戰，比氏頃發表聲明如下：余茲正式表明決意誓，以法西斯共和黨戰士資格，爲祖國名醫之洗雪，爲確保軸心之必勝而戰。又駐南京義藉天主敎宣敎師代表培爾蒂氏，亦發表同樣聲明，誓決效忠法西斯共和黨。</p>
<h3>財次陳之碩　對記者談話</h3>
<p>南京六日中央社電　財政部次長陳之碩頃就中央社記者叩詢問題，一一詳答如次：　日僑於十月起向國府遵章納我，敢問該項親收之數字如何？答，日僑自十月一日起依照我國稅司我法繳納各稅，關係我國國權之完整，意義至爲重大，預料必有良好成績，至稅收數字，須俟層轉到部，方能統計。　自行政院公布限制各省市徵收賦稅辦法，對於農村經濟之裨益如何？答，溯自民國二十九年國府還都，本部即呈請行政院撒銷各地苛捐雜稅，由部督促進行，分飭遵照，惟下層　構，間有抽捐情事，本部均隨時糾正，至此次行政院公布限制各省市徵收賦稅辦法，原爲注重民生起見，對於農村經濟，裨益良多，茲附帶說明，關於田賦方面，上年十二月經部擬訂非常時期各省市徵收田賦暫行條例，所有賦額規定以現時地價百分之一爲度，凡田賦附加或敵捐，及其他一切附徵名目，均予停徵，經本部呈奉行政院核准通　遵辦有案，至監督地方財政暫行辦法及同法施行細則，在十八年四月及二十二年八月，均經產頒有案，現仍遵照執行。　中儲與聯銀簽訂三次匯兌契約後，南北金融之流通，裨益甚多，敢問此種辦法是否臨時性質，將來南北通貨問題是否因此而得有進一步之融合。答，中儲準備兩行所訂匯兌契約，其性質原爲便利南北金融之流通，及適應實際之需要，既不能指爲臨時措置，亦不便預定施行時期，惟於通貨之融通，自必更進一步，毋　　言。</p>
<h3>中日文化溝通　已步入正軌　兩國決首次交換作家</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　在現階段下中。日文化之溝通，已遂漸步入正軌，兩國已決定首次交換第一流作家及新進文學者，但此舉並非爲第二次文學者大會中所決定者。過去幾十年以至幾百年未能解決之　案，皆將於此遂步解決，故其義意至深且鉅，關於人選及其他交涉，均由日本文學報國會負責辦理，日本派赴中國作家已內定爲阿部知二，小田嶽夫，久保田萬太郞，卜林秀雄，上海方面爲吉屋信子，眞船夫，北京方面亦定六名，且將於上海北京至少多派遣一名，爲常駐人員。中國方面首次派來日本之第一流人員爲陶亢德，徐白林二氏，皆爲曾出席第二屆文學者大會之中國新進文學家，且二氏現均在東京，陶亢德研究日本一般文化，徐氏於東京帝大研完室專攻國學。又除此交換作家外，並決定同時交　中日文化研究員，日方派遣明治大學文藝科畢業之淸水信氏赴北京研究，中國方面派遣北京大學文學院畢業生徐守忠及宋桂英女士，即將來日，又日本文學報國會事務局長久米正雄，爲辦理此等文學者之交換與明年度文學者大會舉行之準備事宜，預定本月二十日赴中國，行期約一星期。</p>

<p>盤谷六日中央社電　泰國軍事訪日考察團團長培齊德中將，五日上午特會見此間日本記者團，發喪此行觀感如次：　等此次訪日之主要目的。雖爲考察友邦之軍事，但余以爲不僅軍事，即舉凡一切事項，皆欲藉此行與日　提携親　。在日時倍承各地日方人士　烈歡迎，盛意招待，殊堪銘感，於東京勾留約二週之久，曾與東修首相曁日本陸海軍首腦會晤，交換種種意見，此外並於各地詳爲參觀各軍需工廠。而參觀日軍需工業使余深感於　者。即　日本從事此次聖戰，決不仰賴外力，材料技術皆由自給。尤當參　飛　工廠及造船廠後，深感對日本工業龐大之生產力，寄以全付之信賴。並得睹及某某軍艦之製造情形。又於參觀明野之航空學校時，見及日本陸軍駕駛員之戰鬥訓練最値感念，即此次訓練演習，全爲空戰，歸途中並參觀馬來。非島之戰跡，當憶起日軍在此大東亞戰爭中之勇戰精神與收穫　人之戰果，實覺　嘆不已。　之，余以此行使對日本軍事力益趨加强信賴，且深感定將與日本共同作戰至最後勝利，而對此次戰爭之勝利，亦巳深信不疑。</p>

<p>東京六日中央社電　此間讀　新聞頃　越南德古總督文一篇，　爲「東亞之越南」，其內容大意如次：越南之對外關係，尤對亞洲各鄰國之關係，於此次世界大戰發生後，巳遭受深刻之影響，在事實上，越南巳與歐美交通斷絕，但其政治之機　，並未因此而發生變化。越南文化經濟向東　亞各國具有密切之關係：且此種關係日趨緊密，世界各文明國家間交易之恢復，必須具備一切進步之條件，此亦爲吾人所熟知者。預料全世界恢復交易之時，亦不致阻害東亞民族與此間之交易，或反而更促進之，故余認爲越南之現狀極爲明朗。越南總督府爲改善構成印度支那聯盟之安寗幸福，決以法蘭西之名義加以保獲，因此越南乃採取獨等之態度，但此並非閉關自守之謂，良以越南已以東亞一份子之資格，與日本互相協助，建設大東亞新秩序。同時，越南總督府決効忠法本國政府，並　行與日本所定之諾言，更期待與日本在政治上協力，定能收穫無上之成果，而此種協力之精神，將在經濟方面充分發揮之。當此經濟協定履行之際，越南對東亞，尤其對日本輸出大最之各種物資，其中以米及玉蜀黍爲主，而越南所獲之代價，即仰仗供給國內不足之物資，但在此戰爭時期，日本對越南之需要雖欲盡量供給，然亦有不甚　滑者。此實爲一大問題。爲解決此種問題，則實有賴於越南生產力之增强，故今日越南不僅需補足自己物資之不足，並應爲整個大東亞而努力生產，現越南巳努力生產發動機用之燃料及代用潤滑油。其次再就越甫增加棉產而言，應將一般衣料必需之原料供給各地工業及手工業者，越南除謀增加農業生產外，尤需努力製造工業品，現在生產潤滑油及酒精及溶解油等，已收復莫大成果。同時，對於化學製品化學藥品之製造，已開始調查，並研究越南重要物資，因在數量上受有限制，故對其利用方面不得不設有嚴格之規定，對於輸入物資巳採取分配制。綜上所述，越南現在努力協力戰爭，並巳採取萬全對策，以謀運用一般機構，充分發揮越南資源力，提高民衆生活水準，並謀彼等物資及精神兩方面之繁榮，越南對祖國法蘭西所負之使命亦即在此也</p>
<p>西貢六日中央社電　越南當局及現地日軍當局，對確立越南　維自給體制問題，曾歷作種種研究，茲就越南之客觀條件而言，確認增產棉花實爲解決該問題之關鍵。按越南一九一三年曾輸出棉紗五千萬噸，不幸與美棉，埃及棉競爭失敗，生產遂行繳减。此次大戰前寬减至最低數量，然越南棉業，就過去之統計而觀，尙屬有望，故此次當局籌備積極增產，擴充栽種面積，提高棉花價格等方策，即可具體實施。</p>

<h3>德軍沿聶伯河　構築背水陣　全綫展開猛烈反攻</h3>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　據德著名軍事評論家賽爾特里晒斯上尉，五日夜談東綫戰局稱；德軍司令部已決定自德軍到　聶伯河後，停止撤退作戰。</p>
<p>阿根廷　城六日中央社電　德軍當局自宣布東綫撤退作戰終了後，乃沿聶伯河構築背水陣地，於　綫展開猛烈反攻，不容蘇軍前進一步。聶伯河戰况終陷於膠著狀態。蘇軍　關報紅星報承認德軍大規模反攻，期望蘇軍將兵　起，謂若不　退德軍之反攻，蘇軍之攻勞則無望成功。據德方消息，在斯　倫斯克維特貝斯克公路上仍有激戰，傳德軍已於　地點突入蘇軍陣地。</p>
<p>爭奪橋頭堡兩軍殊死戰</p>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　德國新聞社訉：斯摩倫斯克以西與特米杜夫西北各戰區一般之情形，雖仍無變化，但在該區作戰之德軍，於星期一日向　又獲得土地上之進展，尤其在劇烈之肉搏戰之後，蘇軍反攻數次均被擊退。奧爾薩至斯摩倫斯克之公路兩旁又起激戰，蘇軍攻被若干局部之缺口，但不久德後備兵即加以塡平，德砲隊與　　機合作，擊潰在進行中之蘇軍縱隊、對於該區之戰爭買獻甚大，東綫北部星期一有更活躍之消息，尤其在伊爾曼湖之南，蘇軍調動頻繁，遭德軍有效之轟擊。伏爾克好夫前綫，蘇軍强大衝鋒隊之冒險，被德軍及時　察而加以抑阻。拉多加湖之南蘇軍企圖攔阻德軍拉直陣終之行動，但爲德軍所擊提而未能達到目的。同時德軍偵察隊報告敵軍在亞索夫海以北前綫附近整頓部隊。蘇軍不顧前數日所受之重大損失，顯然正在計劃重行進攻。</p>
<p>南路德軍陣地改善</p>
<p>梅立托波爾之南　軍　退蘇軍之進攻。而奪獲山頭堡壘一座，因而其陣地大見改進，蘇軍向梅立托波爾橋頭陣地北翼所發動之另一攻勢，在德軍防禦重砲火之下宣告　　。柴普魯基橋頭星期日晚雖爲活動之所在，星期一日未受蘇軍之攻擊，但尼埃波羅目得羅夫斯克之西北則發生劇烈之戰事，該處有一河之對岸　晚受重砲火之轟擊，蘇軍以增援部隊在聶伯河之對岸登陸，企圖收復以前所失去之地，該處整晚進行激戰，蘇但未得寸進。蘇軍並在中部聶伯河與普里貝特河口間數百公里長之前綫迭次企圖獲得新橋頭堡與登陸地點，但各處均被阻。包括戰車與機械化部隊之德軍一集團佔領普里貝特河口低地之却爾諾比爾鎭，同時並渡河堅守其橋頭堡。蘇軍迭次進攻均未得逞。德軍在泰曼半島所獲防禦上之新成功更爲顯著蓋因蘇軍曾於星期一　動步兵數師團與坦克車一旅團，企圖突破德軍之主要戰綫，但在狹小之戰區無法展開其部隊，而不得不以密集之隊伍，向德軍陣地進攻，　軍損失甚大，而獲　不放棄其企圖，但敵軍之猛攻終於在德軍砲火與德機投彈下宣告崩潰</p>
<p>東綫德軍戰略利用時間因素</p>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　據海通社訉：德軍事專家狄特瑪中將演講東綫德軍廻避戰之限度，不僅雖有利之天然地勢，且須便於未來之行動，交通綫之縮短，以及俄國西部密佈之河流及沼澤，足爲使戰局趨向穩定之有利條件。而蘇軍於猛攻數日之後，損失旣極慘重，力量亦　薄弱，此外吾人並以焦土政策，對付前曾以該種手段敎我之人，但此尙非決定性之因索，陣綫之縮短，須以己方之兵力能與對方之軍力及其交通綫之長短保持平衡爲先決條件，東綫德軍兩年來，均係以寡敵衆，尤以近月來爲甚。蘇方於今夏更傾其所有猛烈來攻，其兵員之衆，超出我方不知幾許倍，然旣係於短時間內所集合而成，訓練方而自不免稍差。德軍於兩年餘來艱苦作戰，深入敵土，時至今日，猶握有攻守之有利地位。東歐及南歐之戰事，充分表現德軍之毅力，時間因素之獲得是否有利，須視獲得者之是否能善爲利用。無論在東歐或南歐，德國均係爲時間而戰，且　利　此時間，發展其驚人　　學大才，以易取具體之戰蹟。</p>
<h3>亞特里亞海東岸　德防務堅强　反軸心機襲希臘未逞</h3>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　反軸心軍隨義國南部戰事之進展，在阿爾巴尼亞及希臘實行登陸作戰。德軍當局爲此特於六日發表聲明，說明該方面德軍陣錢之堅强，大旨謂，亞特里亞海東部地域，尤其是面臨奧蘭托海峽之希臘及阿爾巴尼亞領內，因德軍之堅强作戰巳趨安定。該方面德軍最近佔領各府島以後，佔領地區益形擴大，阿爾巴尼亞原住民對德軍之協力始終不渝。</p>

<h3>義東岸英軍　向平原推進　遭德軍猛烈襲擊</h3>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　　海通社軍事訪員塞托里斯稱：義國南部四面之戰局，前日並無重大變化，敵軍顯然自那不勒斯區城分遣軍隊，準備　續推進，敵軍先鋒被德軍後衛阻於那不勒斯與伏爾特諾間之平原，內地之美第五軍右　加緊北攻，企圖越過貝尼文托。美軍坦克車隊在山區仍遭遇困難，且德軍後衛阻止敵軍進展，使勿超過德軍司令部預定之速度。英第八軍右　向北進展，已抵巴托洛密奧鎭，英第八軍中路一部分巳折向西面，該處戰况並不激烈。沿亞特里亞海岸平原推進之英軍及帖　里附近登陸之英軍，均遭德軍之襲擊，敵軍顯欲在帖木里（Termoli）以北登陸包抄，該處戰事殊堪重視。</p>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　　空軍快速戰鬥機轟炸機編隊，四日曾往　義東岸之英軍橋頭堡帖木里，猛炸登陸設施及登陸舟艇　，予以極大損害，並炸毀重砲四門。</p>
<p>美第五軍北進遇阻</p>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　德國新聞訉：星期一義大利南部之戰事，由駐於東部沿海與阿平靑山附近之軍隊首當其衝，該區以西直至卡姆巴尼亞低窪處，戰事之行動僅限於德後防隊與英美偵察分隊彼此之小接觸，敵軍企圖突破貝尼文托與伏爾都拉拉間之德軍陣綫，結果完全失敗。敵軍現仍面對闊而深之德軍防區，德軍依照預定計劃，向較高之山區移動，未受英美軍之阻。奉命由貝尼文托徹退之德軍後防隊，阻止敵軍在德軍陣綫中作成任何缺口，在此項軍事行動中，强大之美軍偵察隊損失重大，尤其在貝尼文托之西南　脫薩契奥與愛羅拉等處敵軍，擬欲　過通往卡姆巴尼安低窪處之公路，但在損失　甲偵察軍五百輛若十　托化國輛與大批戰死　之後，即向　問退去。英第八軍在其他各區一無　得後，即加緊努力向東　　進，福查低窪處以及　山　與沿海區，當即發生局部之激戰。伏爾都拉拉之東，拉里諾之東，以及帖水里　近　海岸英軍加緊進攻，德軍作堅强之抵抗。在伏爾都拉拉附近作戰之加拿大軍，於損失「旭門」坦克車四輛與重大之死傷後，即停止其突破之企圖。英軍在坦克　掩護之下，企圖向拉里國之東前進，但遭德軍之側面進攻　其先頭部隊遭德軍　　　目標準確之打擊，死傷甚多。</p>
<p>肅淸後方收獲戰果</p>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　德國新聞社訉：德軍在北部義大利之掃蕩行動，獲到極大成功。在特里　斯區游匪被俘者一萬三千人，在過去三日之作戰中，在伊斯特里亞方面之戰塲上，匪徒被擊斃者一十一百名，巴特里奧之從屬者被殺或被俘者甚衆，德軍所獲輕重武器亦不少，其他摩托車輛燃料庫及山砲及高射砲等向爲義軍所有而於最近投降或交付於叛黨之手。現掃蕩行動正向海岸發展，對斯洛夫芬尼地區之掃蕩亦甚成功，淸除山區及交通綫星期日已消　匪徒甚多。</p>

<h3>軍需省與生產行政（二）</h3>
<p>新設的軍需省，具備怎樣的內容與性格，有待於今後官民的協力而決定，現在尙不能預斷。在這時候，我們來考察德英美蘇的生產行政機構，檢討軍需省機構的實體，不無少許意義吧。當然，因國情及生產情勢之顯著的不同，故無論那個國家的機構，不能完全原封不動的移到日本，這是應該切記的。</p>
<h3>德國</h3>
<p>盟邦德國於一九三九年八月未殷置最高國防會議，亦可稱爲戰時內閣，乃關於戰爭經濟之最高評議機關，四年計劃主持者戈林元帥就任爲議長，委員有佛烈克內政部長（最近調任），芬克經濟部長，　斯元首代表（現爲缺額），卡迭爾國防軍總監，蘭麥司內閣書記官長等五名。其任務爲調整戰時中的經濟政治及軍事。這最高國防會議的附屬機關爲戰時經濟最高協議會（一九三九年十二月創設），以戈林元帥爲議長，寇爾那四年計劃次官爲劃議長，經濟部，食糧部，勞働部，交通部，內務部各次官，中央山林局次官，價格審議委員，國防軍軍需局長，黨代表爲委員，其目標在於戰爭經濟運營的圓滑化。如此，戈林元帥以四年計劃主持者資格掌握經濟部系的全權，同時並兼任最高國防會議及戰時經濟最高會議的議長，因此，占着戰爭經濟的總指揮官的地位。</p>
<h3>四年計劃內容</h3>
<p>四年計劃主持者爲現實地行使其所吸收的全權起見，在四年計劃廳內設置中央計劃委員會爲最高執行機關，任命史倚亞軍需部長，寇爾那四年計劃次官，米爾希航空次官爲委員，遭委員會的任務，在於</p>
<p>決定原料，資材比　分配的大綱，</p>
<p>決定應置爲生產重心的物資，</p>
<p>決定素材工業並加工工業中應予擴充的，部門。</p>
<p>委員會的實權在於史倍亞軍　部長，所以軍需部長有着作爲四年計劃主持者的直屬權力者而運營戰爭經濟的地位。軍需部長於此始爲一般人所注目。德國的軍需部長（正確地說，當初的名稱爲武器彈藥都長），由一九四〇年三月十七日的元首布告所任命，初任部長爲全國道路總監陶德博士。</p>
<p>其任務爲使一切從事兵器生產及彈藥製造的機關發揮最高度的能率，且爲統轄起見，實行監督軍需品生產。軍需部長在遂行任務上有發布一切必要命令的全權。其結果軍官的關係機關胥受軍需部長的指揮，（必要的塲合任命軍需部管理官），從事軍需生產睹機關人事的更動，必需軍需部長的同意，又規定各關係機關負有應軍需部長的要求而供給一切必要報告的義務。但在軍需部長的任命之初，軍需品的發定，須經國防軍的軍需局原料計劃際屬四年計劃廳的管轄事項，一般經濟行政由軍需部長管轄，故軍需部長的權限，未必十分强大。去歸年月軍需，部長突然殉職。史倍亞就任之後，跟着中央計劃委員會的設置，軍需部長的權限，大爲橫充，即經由委員會而四年計劃廳保持聯絡，反之，國防軍的軍需局（局長托瑪斯大將）則置於軍需部的指揮之下，於是關於軍需生產的一切權限，盡二其手。</p>
<p>史倍亞自被任爲新四年計劃軍需生產全權管理人之後，和主持民需生產的芬克經濟部長的權限，暫　有明確的劃分。軍需部長的權限並地位大體如上，但至本年九月　日，又大加改革。把芬克經濟部長所主管的民需生產亦置於軍需部長的直轄下，史倍亞氏一手掌管軍需民需的全部生產，其結果，名稱亦正式改爲軍需生產部長，被任命爲四年計劃全權委員長。</p>
<p>同時，芬克經濟部長則管轄國外貿易，物品配給，商業部門，財政部門，並參加中央計劃委員會。</p>
<p>如此，史倍亞軍需部長現爲德國軍需生產之事實上的總帥。他年事尙輕，未滿四十，曾爲建築師。軍需部的下層機構，除前述的軍需局，軍需監督廳之外，另有：</p>
<p>軍需　問—由陸海軍代表五名，民間代表人民組織，麼對大臣的諮詢。</p>
<p>生產指導局—動員生產集團及指導委員地區執行官，軍管區管理實，中央技術委員會等協力組織，擔任生產指導。「生產集團」設於各業爲業者之自治的生產集團，爲其長的指導委員由政府任命，　提高生產能率及技術上，收得極大的效果。地區執行官及軍管區執行官爲政府的監督官，中央技術委員會爲技術方而的業者之自治的協力機關。</p>
<p>總務局—擔任各　間的聯絡。</p>
<p>如上述的生產集團制度，以確立「企業的國家性爲目標，在我國頗有參考的價値。要之，德國的生產行政機　，希特勒—戈林—史倍亞爲首腦，其特色爲一集貫的獨　國家所特具的中權力。</p>
<h3>蘇聯</h3>
<p>同樣是獨　國家，但蘇聯的生產行政機構，以會議體爲中心而構成蘇聯並沒有特別稱爲軍需省的機構，有許多產業關係人民委員部並立着爲統制這許多人民　員部起見，設置了六個產業會議，這產業會議的上層機構爲在一九三七年所設立的經濟會　，因一九四〇年一月的改組而　現在的情　。經濟委員的會員如次：</p>
<p>議長—人民委員會議長史大林。副議長—人民委員會議的副議長。委員—國防委員議會長（伏洛希洛夫），外交人民委員—交通人民委員，外國置易人民委員，檢察總長，各產業會議　長，勞働團體　記長。</p>
<p>經濟會議屬於聯邦人民委員會議（內閣），審查國民經濟的年度計劃，確認各種團查計劃，監督並敗普經濟的運　。從這些事務出發，和作爲企劃機關的國家計劃委員會，同可視爲戰爭經濟的中心推進隊。</p>
<p>這樣，聯邦人民委員會織—經濟會朧—產業會議—人民委負　等許多行政機構，乃告成立，擔任軍需生產。此中產業會議，其橫成委員三人至五人。委員除國家計劃委員會的戰務以外不許兼任。議長及副議長，從人民委負會　的副於　長（十二　）中　　，各會議特別設一總管理局，產業會　的內容如次：</p>
<h3>產業會議內容</h3>
<p>金化學產業會　（非鐵金屬工業，　鐵工　。化學工業各人民委員部，亞硫酸鹽，酒精，加水分解工業總管理局）</p>

<h3>仁濟堂　辦理六十餘年　古典的慈善機關</h3>
<p>靠近現代化的愛多亞路，那條平民化的雲南路上，在不很　齊的大大小小的商店陣綫中，　立着一座高大的廟宇式的古屋，這就是著名全　的中國古典的大善團—上海仁濟善堂。</p>
<p>六十一年前</p>
<p>踏進高大的門庭，頭疊，二堂：可以看出我國近古的建築藝術，特別是那些　額，令人悠然興懷古之情。這裏還有兪樾（曲園）所　「仁濟堂」三個大字的構　　。現在　負　堂事務工作的許如坐先生說起往史，眞是動聽。</p>
<p>是六十一年前的事了，在今日南京路虹廟附近，出現一座「文明局」，那就是上海亡濟善堂的前身。文明局是辦社會公益事業的，其主要工作，一是「敬惜字紙」的淸潔運動，二是開設「義塾」的兒童啓　運動，三是舉辦「鄕約」的民衆宣傳（勸善）運動；此外還致力於恤貧恤嫠　慈善事業。一般的說，在字義上是無愧於「文明局」三字的。</p>
<p>當時上海的悲善事業，維持原始狀態，主要的還只　個別的善士的善言善行，說不上組織，自然也說不上事業。但是文明局之成立，給上海社會上以相當的刺激，因爲適合社會實際的需要，漸漸有擴大事務範圍的必要，所以不久就由南京路遷至北海路，改名一中和局」，氣派大了不小，同時又開辦施黔給藥的善藥，成爲當時上海貧民最大的救助者。</p>
<p>「中和局」的慈善事業不僅得到廣大市民的感戴，而且也得到一般樂善人士的信任，認爲這樣有組織有計劃的行善，比個別的隨意的善　有意　得多。於是，捐助的金額日增一日，當時主持者得到各界這種鼓勵之後越發提高了爲社會服務的信念，同時，覺得慈善事業要能有組織有計劃的辦，除了辯事人人格道德高尙之外，還得機關本身有穩固的基礎，纔能永遠維持下去，不致中途停頓。於是，就購置今日雲南路的地皮立永遠的基業。同時，進而擴充善業的範圍，名稱也由「中和堂」改稱爲「仁濟堂」還是光緒九年的事，主持其事的是士紳施善昌先生等，而買雨島太守助成之力也値得紀念，爲政府與人民合力舉辦慈善事業永留佳話。</p>
<p>仁濟堂在雲南路三十五號新夏開辦以後，所辦主要的慈善事業是：施醫，施藥，育嬰。冬季施　衣米施棺，恤嫠，恤貧　等。數十年來，不　不　。現在除了施米及施棺，因實際不可能而暫行停辦之外，其他仍舊盡力推行，而且對於上海及別處發生災荒等事，也量力爲之奔走勸慕及以基金捐助，處處表示其「己飢己　」，「胞與爲懷」的精神。不過當則的中心工作，則是施診給藥。</p>
<p>是上午，仁濟善堂已擠滿了人，大廳。照廳。天井和東廂，一桌一桌的圍坐着各式各樣的人物，初看幾乎疑惑自己走錯了，誤入什麽大茶樓大菜館了。但是，這裏沒有紅紅綠綠刺目的服飾，這裏也沒有脂粉烟酒　人欲嘔的氣味，這裏更聽不到失去　魂的歌笑與囈語，原來都是些衣衫　褸的　病大衆，大庭裏擠　的是候診者和領藥者，南北兩大　是內，外，兒。眼，針各科的診療室，四廂是給藥課。</p>
<p>施醫與給藥</p>
<p>每一位醫生都吸住了好幾桌的待診的病人，他們細心地詢問　　，診探病症，他們更小心謹愼地開寫斷案及藥方。診治一個病人，往在要化去很多時間，不像一般「名醫」那麽粗心大意。而且他們對於知識落後的貧苦病人，特別溫和地反復指導，像慈母敎其愛女一樣不憚煩瑣，總要病人完全了解。眞像一個病人告訴記者的：「出了重金，也請不到像仁濟堂裏那樣的大夫！」</p>
<p>給藥課和普通國藥號一個模樣，那位方品章主任說他們努力的目標是：第一，對於藥材之選購務求道地，第二是配合調製的謹惧，第三是按方配藥手續之淸楚，避免遺忘及錯誤。他領着去看貧病者領藥的情形，辦事員有條不紊的工作着，而手脚敏捷，更合領藥者沒有久候不到之苦。辦事員有着照務的良心，但沒有一副　門面色！</p>
<p>捧出一大疊施醫施藥的紀錄，以本年的八個月而言，施醫號數最少是二月份的二千零三十四號，設多是八月份的八千一百九十二號，施藥最少是二月份的四百九十九　，最多是八月份的六千八百九十一劑。平均每月施醫總在五千號上下，施藥則在四千五百劑左右。今年一月至八月底施藥總値即達十一萬五千元之鉅。查一二月份數字之少除了時季關係之外，是因爲該堂當時經費奇　，祗施送赤貧者，略有能力者勸共自理，所以施送不多。據說往年數字極大，施醫施藥總在十二萬號以上，近因交通不便，來求醫藥的以附近市民爲多。然而數字已經不少了。</p>
<p>上海仁濟善堂，現在是純粹民間性的慈善團體。上層組織是董事和監事會，份子都是本市最著名的士紳，如意事長爲開　亭氏，副董事長是黃涵之趙　卿二氏，常務董事爲朱吟江。朱　臣。陸介孫，王叔賢四氏，董事尙有施省之氏等十一人。常務監事爲朱子奎氏，監事爲朱　丞，朱棄塵。馮炳兩三氏。</p>
<p>仁心與仁術</p>
<p>實際在仁濟善堂處理日常工作的組織比較的　單。除了育嬰部份另有「仁濟育嬰堂」的組織以外，計分事務，施醫，施藥三大部分。事務部包括會計員一共只有三位職員，主任就是許如生先生，一位誠實而能幹的典型人物，他能以極少數的人員，推行規　職大的着業。給藥部有職員十位，在服務歷二十餘年的方品章先生指揮下工作，每天上午是工作最緊張的時俟，誰也希望多生出兩雙手來幫忙，可免貧病者焦急的　　。而下午，他們要配製藥物，也不怎麽閑暇。</p>
<p>施醫部份，現在分設內科，外科，兒科，眼科和針科等等。各科都有專任的中醫負責，內科有錢筱佩，謝鴻英，張　秋，謝待　，錢世芳，方伯時，董長松，吳夢　，陸幼香　醫生，錢　張三氏在該堂服務巳在十年以上。外科有王煜康，李聲東，汪葆靑諸醫生，針科有　廷芳，　　靜諸醫生，眼科有喻萬邦，張應才諸醫生；小兒科有朱培玉和洋涇浜聖母院的　女姆姆潘修道醫生；大部份都巳在該院有十年以上的服務歷史。</p>
<p>所有仁濟善堂的服務人員，雖然不盡是宗敎的信徒，但是都有宗敎家犧牲小我扶助他人的精神，在這物價飛躍的潮流中，　員所領薪水最高不過一白八十元，工人只不過四，五十元，另外米貼三百六十元，戔戔之數，雖只求個人糊口，已感不足，當然更　不上贍養家屬了。醫生除了可領軍費每月一百八十元之外，完全不再支給任何共他費用，他們懷仁心，行仁術，以救人濟世。（未完）</p>

<p>昨日發報時間七點四十分</p>
<p>短評　米統會職員無兼職</p>
<p>昨天本報社評「論兼職」，對於新近成立的米糧統制委員會，傳聞有市商會職員兼職之事。我們本於重視米糧統制委員會與市商會雙方工作效率的立塲，全張辭退一面，專幹一面。鄭重對該會當局敬致忠言。　接市商會來函，表示米統會　備之時，會調商會職員兼辦事務，迨米統會成立　兼職人員即改爲專職。</p>
<p>我們對於米糧統制委員會，自始即以誠摯熱情，備致殷切期待之意。期待愈殷切，情　愈率直，因爲米糧對於民衆的關係太密切！太重大了！尤其米糧統制委員會的產生，是爲過去糧政屢次失敗以後，而　　　情勞中迫切要求出來的，嚴厲的設法、米統會的工作，是只能成功，不可失敗的。所以，我們不得不再四　言，先從人事上樹立楷模，爲工作成功奠定始基。</p>
<p>現在關了市商會的聲明，可以證明米統會當局已能重視本身仟務的艱巨，不勝佩　，同時，我們希望該會能始終不懈、及早達成艱巨的任務。</p>

<h3>籃球對抗　强華勝</h3>
<p>盛大籃球對抗賽第二幕　昨下午三時半起，仍在百樂門球塲舉行，因初　　　　之激烈，故　衆盛况空前，結果女子隊　中凱　高奏，報復前賽　敗之仇，請纓參戰之華南與同仁一役，華南賴連絡得體，擊退　家班同仁隊，壓軸大戲强華戰混合，强華昨日臨陣，拖被釜沉舟之心，將士三軍用命，昨日演出，鈎心鬥角，堅張萬分，戰局亦時成拉　戰之局面，但强華有志寬成，在極　緊張之形勞下，賴最後奮發有爲，卒以四十二比三十二打退混合</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>「重利」</h3>
<p>吾人研究經濟　想　史者，都能道及中古關於重利之學說；在中古時，「重利」一語還常　指利息而言，然敢其　義，凡物價之高於其平價者皆爲「重利」，換一　話說，就是所取多於所予。中古時代　　取利爲絕對違法之舉動；泊乎都市及貨幣經濟　途而後，此種思想已大有變更，到了近代工業進步，交易　興，貨幣之値與敢利之說，益復有所變更，到了戰時，其變更乃愈甚。</p>
<p>在古代鄉村自治　體之間，人民重視感價，取利乃非所容；在貨幣　濟時代，貸欺而坐利之事，每多行之於休戚不相關之個人或團體間，於是『重利』之風以　；　了戰時，由於一般人抱着「渾水撈魚」的思想，益復不能實行純潔的商　行爲，祗知重視利息，利息乃愈加重、糾正之道，在於利用敎育力量，轉移人類思想，使其認識社會福利的沒落，就是個人福利的沒落。</p>
<p>因此，在抑平物價，安定民生的呼　下，我們主張限制商人利潤；本報社評前輪貸欵行莊參加盈利分配一個問題，認爲「爲協助消滅囤　，抑平物價，從　本上解決應付浩　開支的問題，還以不參加盈利分配，忍受暫時困雖，較爲適當」，就是還個意思。我們鑒於南市各界　請締禁押當加高利息及縮短當期，尤其是屆期偶遇當戶疎忽，越宿即被沒去，不允放讀，此不特違反法律原則，（因法律設定抵押　後，抵押人仍得占有標的物而使用收益處分之）抑且影響人民生計，因爲戰時人民生活困難之秋，雖在中人之家，有時亦不能不恃押質以維生活，所以，「重利」攸關戰時的市民福利問題甚大，故申論之。</p>
<h3>財部核復商統會准許　標金自由買賣　價格亦可無庸限制</h3>
<p>中央社　訉　查行政院令頒收買棉紗棉布暫行條例及實施要綱規定，有應付價欵之半數，按標金每條（十兩）四萬元之定價折算等語，全國商業統制總會，當以標金曾有收歸國有之議，將來付出之標金，能否自由買賣、價格有無限制，節經商請財政部核示，頃挅記者向商統會探悉，財政部業已正式函復該會，以黃金收歸國有，並未實施，各紗布商領得標金，自可自由買賣，價格亦無府限制，可以公開通告云。</p>
<h3>油專會在各產區　將設辦事處</h3>
<p>南京六日中央社電　商統會油糧專業委員會，鑒於各地雜糧類，如大豆，小豆，苞米，高梁，油類，肥料，油菜種棉實落花生，胡麻等，均將　次登塲，故於妝買配給運銷等手續，俱皆進行　備，槪在各產區設辦事處，以備收買運　工作，得以圓滿推勸。茲悉本京之辦事處，將於短期內設立。</p>
<h3>煤業公團禁止　在市塲買賣</h3>
<p>燃料市况邇來頗爲混亂，煤商冀獲不法利潤，「黑市買賣」復趨猖獗。昨悉煤業公團鑒於市塲目前僅允同業商號作運輸上之接洽，任何交易猶在　禁之例，聞已分別佈告，絕對禁止市塲買賣，一經察覺，即　逐出塲、或嚴厲處罰，一面剴勸同業　守市塲規定，勿作越軌行動。否則無論識與不識，概不徇情，一律照章辦理</p>
<p>配給煤斤嚴禁轉售</p>
<p>查本市各種煤斤（無論煙白屑塊）早經當局授權石炭聯合會負責派配，惟爲推動福利計，乃有「大中聯煤號」之設立，下層機構即爲　煤業商同業聯合會。　煤業小賣商聯合會，迭次派配煤斤皆由大中縣煤號主持其事。但此項派給煤斤均以售給正當用戶爲限，嚴禁同業中相互轉售漁利，及擅自　高價格，或非法隱　，否則取銷配給。</p>
<p>煤球原料現尙充沛</p>
<p>上海社記者昨自熱諳煤業　况者探悉，本市存煤　　與二三月前相差無幾，　誤前各紡織印染廠在停頓狀態中，此項　煤決　本月份紀轉　正當有　用戶，但煤球原料（白煤　）尙　充油，　各製球　所需皆由關係當局按期　給，惟晚近煤球塊貨供應非特無法好轉，反竟不易購得，　　深感不安，均盼當局激　眞相，以利民生</p>
<h3>當局將　統制蛋價</h3>
<p>自本星期一起，中日雙方對於蛋類之供求，巳實施一致行動，加以統制。故蛋類之高昻價格，即可　低，　目前蛋價之增　，乃由於商人破澳統制　　之故。</p>
<p>重施分配方法</p>
<p>目前統制蛋價之計動，乃在使以前之中日分配方法重新行施，並確定限價，此項限價約相等於五月一日時之市價。統制計劃，包括賣買雙方，以使上海區蛋類供求均受有效之統制。</p>
<p>運輸須經許可</p>
<p>爲緝查蛋類偷運　見，辦理統制當局將自下星期一起，發給蛋類運輸許可證，如未備是項證　者，一槪不准通過。同時並爲阻止黑市賣　，上海地區蛋類之賣買及進口，將建立一適當制度予以管理。</p>
<p>中日配給　法</p>
<p>查上海日本蛋商　合會與上海區蛋商公會，對於掦子蛋類冷　公司所售出之存貨，其分配計劃將行施如下：雞蛋方面日商聯合會佔百分之六十，華商佔百分之四十，鴨蛋方面則日商佔百分之四十，華商得百分之六十。</p>

<h3>中儲實施通貨政策概況　物資統制通貨工作均見成效</h3>
<p>中央儲備銀行，爲抑平物價，發　健全金融機構，自今春三月以來，即致力收縮通貨工作與努力維持通貨價格，最近金融界已得有健全基礎，物價與通貸工作，均收莫大效果，而物資方面之統制施策，給與金融界之成果，允可期待，本年春季以前，中央儲備銀行，力謀流通中儲券，進行統一通貨工作，使參戰後之</p>
<p>國府經濟</p>
<p>得一大　　，同時　於物價高　，非獨爲　　氏，且影響戰時經濟工作，因此針對統制物資，及抑制通貨兩方着手，積極予以實施，以限制貸款，及收回資　，爲收縮通貨方策之重點，並鼓動民衆儲薔，藉以吸收遊資，於三月十五日公布中央儲備銀行貸款整理　制　法，於三月十五日以後兩月內，逐　收　儲　銀行之</p>
<p>同業放款</p>
<p>非經特別許可，決不再行放款貨款，期滿後決不延期，且停放一般　貸欵，及　糧棉紗等日用品之押欵，若以商品請求押款者，同業公會會員必須持有該公會之證明書，及主管機關發行之　業許可證，因此嚴厲經濟施策實施後，一般國積金融份子，無不大起恐慌，而銀根呈現異常緊縮狀態，五月下旬，中儲行資金收回工作告一段落，</p>
<p>統制金融</p>
<p>狀態，漸入正軌後，日本銀行放款，槪受大使館　　，中國銀行則由銀錢業公會自主施行統制，　以協助中儲行之金融統制工作，而將圓滑推行，其後更得官民雙方協力，通貨工作，則更行圓滑，中儲前發行　，因受日方廢止發行軍　影響，社會　要頭寸極殷，迄上月間呈空前最高　後，乃漸趨停滯，未久因</p>
<p>發行獎券</p>
<p>資吸收工作之得加連進　，而中儲行及其他銀行之存　數量，形成日趨增加傾向，金融界復轉向健全軌道發展，結果上海物價指數，呈現低落情勢，黑市米價由七月下旬起逐漸低落，其他一般商品，亦追　米價而漸呈軟化，以上海一例，可見物資統制及通貨工作，巳獲有比當成效</p>
<p>今後問題</p>
<p>將爲現行通貨工作之如何合理推行，尤以商統會之棉布棉紗收　如何運用，及米糧統制委員會收買米穀後是否能解決抑制物價問題爲轉移，我人對此，實寄以莫大期</p>

<p>糧食問題意見</p>
<h3>改進糧食問題芻議</h3>
<p>— 史瑜</p>
<p>糧食問題，是國計民生問題中　重要的。我國從古以來，都極重視，洪範八政，第一件就講到食：孔子論政，也說「足食」，國父在三民主義中，也認爲「食的問題」，是人生四大需要之一，自從中國事變發生以來，糧食問題嚴重，政府且設有專部解決民食問題，就上海的情形說，實行糧食統制，已經有一年多的歷史，可是戶口米的配給，愈來愈少；黑市的米價，愈來愈貴，使得一般平民，感覺到罄其所入，不足以謀果腹的苦痛。誠然糧政的不容易辦理，確是事實，這種情形，並不能夠專敎糧政機關負責，但是糧政辦理得不能盡滿人意，恐怕誰也不會否認罷　辮理糧食而發生弊端，歷史上早有先例，並不自今日始，而且弊端所在，無論如何變化，終不外乎內在的原因，和外在的原因兩種：</p>
<p>內在的原因</p>
<p>所謂一內在的原因」就是經辦人員的舞弊；花也雖然千頭萬緒，但是歸納起來，不外「以賤報貴」「以貴報賤」「以多報少」「以少報多」的幾種。所謂「以賤報貴」就是收買糧食的時候，拿次　的貨色，報高等的價錢，雖然數量並不减少，可是由於貨色的優劣不同，價格的高低相差，從中取其差額，也是相當的可觀；至於存儲時候，和運輸時候，就該實行「以多報少」和「以少報多」，所謂「以多報少」者，就是存進時候，或是開始運輸時候，明明收到上白粳米百萬石，不妨藉口損耗，報爲實收九十五萬石，那麽所有超過數量，便是經手者的利益，至於出倉時候，上　本指定派米八十萬石，但是不妨只運出七十八萬石，而且不妨用次等的貨色，於是可以兼用「以賤報負」和「以少報多」的兩種技巧，至於「以貴報賤」是在存倉時或者配給時，都可以應用，等如說明明收到上白粳米，不妨報做次白，用次貨頂　，而把上白粳米出售，一進一出之間，又可稱做利蔽，此外還有九月三日申報社評所載，和囘用，蔴袋費等，名目繁多，所以我國經辦糧食和鍳務，自貲認爲　差，雖然損耗之類，早有規定，可是大都從寬，而且上下其手的地方，還是很多很多，心不狠的，巳綫收入可觀，如其心再狠些，眞可不消多時，便面團團成富家翁了！</p>
<p>外在的原因</p>
<p>我國糧政不能辦理得完善，除了上述的「內在的原因」外還有「外在的原因」又可分做「捐稅重疊」運輸遲緩」「土匪搗亂」和「調查不完善」等數項。所謂「捐稅重疊」，請翻閱九月五日申報張雲搏先生的「米價平議」寫得非常透澈詳明，可以無庸筆者更爲饒舌了。所謂「運輸　　」　此　　勞午，船只不足的時候，確有愛其能助的情態，似乎應黨逐漸設法改良，方　可以使得上海民食的　刻，能得其平，所謂「土匪搗亂」者，因爲目前政府　　的和平區域，　然一天一天的擴大範圍，可是匪區依然存在，這等區域非但不服從政令，且從而搗亂，農民的米糧，常爲他們廉價收去，以致不能運到城市來，　使民食的前途，發生意外的恐慌，再則由於「調查的不完善」，各區可耕的面積，究有若干，每年的收成平均若干，除了供給本地人民需要以外，能有幾何餘裕，可供外鄉之應用。而且政府對於各地的民食，如何調整，似乎亦沒有幣個計則，而只是頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚，所以有規定的糧食，不能按期來滬的現象（此係根據報戰），如其能有精細的計劃，嚴密的組織，那麽上海的民食，應該如期而來，不致發生稽延或减少的事情了！</p>
<p>我國糧政問題，與其侈談過去的弊　，不如力謀今後的改進。一方面增加生產，使得全國人民，可以自給自足，一方面別除中飽，使得耕田的農夫，和食米的人民，都能得到利益，而不感覺痛苦。在當前的環境下，當然非實行統制不可，而糧食統制，又可分爲　統制的步　，和　統制的機構，來講求對策：</p>
<p>統制糧食的步驟</p>
<p>我國雖然號稱以農立國，但是每年糧食的生產，是否足敷人民的需要，學者之間，見解各殊，依照當前情况判斷，糧食的應當增產，是住何人都難否　的，此外如收購，存儲，運輸，配給等等，都應當加以合理的統制，方纔可以使得當前糧食嚴重的狀態，逐漸好轉，現在分別的討論如下：</p>
<p>生產統制　就中國現在的糧食問題而論，應該採取促　生產的政策，分爲下述八項：</p>
<p>（甲）增加單位面積的收穫量　如果　　增加單位面積的農作物收穫景，首先須要考察土地的生產力，土地的生產力，已到了耕作集約的邊際，那就雖增加資本和勞力，結果不免受報　漸减律的支配。中國土地的生產力，就糧食作物的單位面積而言，可知尙未充分利用。布克敎授T.L.Buck　就中國七名十七地方二八六六個農塲，計算主要作物每公頃的平均產量，以興各國比較，其結果如下：</p>
<p>各國主要作物每公頃平均　景比較（單位公　（Quintel）</p>
<p>人檢閱上　，可見中國農作物的產量，不如人的地方尙多，由此可如中國土地的生產力，尙未改進，使米的座量，每公頃增至與日本的產量三〇頃的產量也可和日本的一三，五公　相等，玉蜀黍每公頃的產量，和美國的的生產面積　我國荒地面積，尙沒有確切的統計：地面積達十一億七千七百餘萬畝，至於可耕荒地，千四百六十四萬畝，再則如果能在黃河流域普遍　井，開闢溝渠，在長江流域應用機器，建築堤閘，耕面積，還要擴大，如果利用此等荒地來播種五穀，中國雖不改良生產，而每年米麥的生產量，一定可以大大地增加，至於利用荒地，應由政府設立墾務專局負責辦理，自然能敢宏效。</p>
<p>（丙）改良稻麥種子　我國各地稻麥，因爲種子混雜，品種不良，而收成低劣。現在國內對於品種改良的重要和價値，已有相當認識‘各地政府機關，以及農業學校和農事試騐塲，都扣任試騐品種的工作，用科學方法，改良種子。據報中央大學改良的稻種，較之農家未經改良的種子，可以增產百以上。金陵大學改良　種二九〇五號，在南京附近推廣的結果。比較農家種子，可以增加產　百分之四十。又據該大學小麥改良試騐的成績，單穗　種可以增加生產　百分之五六，八，改良品種和雜交育種，可以增加產量百分之九八。三，至百分之一〇五，三，又水稻育種試之　準產量，可以增加百分之四二至百分之七七。吾國稻麥種子，應該加以改良，可說已是深這無疑的事實。</p>
<p>（丁）改良灌漑和排水　華北各地，在作物生長期內，尤其是小麥和其他冬季作物的生長期內，雨量旣然缺乏，河流灌漑到的區域，亦是有限，所以每畝作物的產量很低，而且種植上亦受限制。因之灌漑工程的設施，和灌漑水源的增加，實在切要，可是工程浩大，非待政府舉辦不可。以前華洋義賬會在華北各地，曾提倡　井灌田，據稱灌漑面積雖小，但是成積很　，農夫興辦也容易，很能提倡推廣。至於長扛流城，地多低　，圩田湖灘等土地，一到冬季任它休閒，就種作物，產量亦不豐多，原因土地低濕，小麥不能夠充分生長，再則每年夏季，長江附近山洪　發，每每容易發生水災，所以排水工作，極爲重要，以　洛夫博士曾經在浙江低田，實行排水生產試騐，結果排水的低田，較之不排水者，產量增加百分之三十，所以提倡排水工作，也很重要。</p>
<p>（戊）防　病蟲的炎害　我國稻麥作物所受病蟲害蟲的損失，雖然沒有確切統計，但是螟蟲的災害，各地都有，可稱　烈。以前　昆蟲學家的估計，公國米糧受螟蟲的損害，平均每年灌十二萬　斤之鉅。如其依照目前價格估計，當然更爲可觀。此外尙有稻熱病，稻胡麻　枯病，麥　病，麥黑穗病，麥黑　病等，每年的損失，也極可觀。防除稻　　　的方　甚多。人力防除的方法，如春季田間採卵，冬季毀　根　，或灌水淹田。藥力防除的方　如用二硫化炭，晶酸，硫磺等驅殺害蟲；用炭酸　，福爾摩林硫酸銅和　酸等防制病害。科學的防　方法如用這種或者支配　　成抗病品種，用以替代染病品種。近來歐美各國採取上述種種方法，防除作物的炎害，推行頗見成效，我國國內農科大學，和農事試騐塲，亦多在仿行，實在應該從速推廣，如其損失减少，就是增加作物的生產。</p>
<p>（巳）改良施肥　地力的肥瘠，對於每畝產量的關係，最是密切，所以地力的保持和增進，對於改進作物的生產，極爲重要。我國農民，祗知墨守成法，對於施肥，從不注意，所以對於增進地力　一問題，根本就不明瞭，查歐美試騐的結果，施用適當肥料，可以增加小麥生產量百分之二十乃至百分之五十。又據南京試騐的結果，如其施用適當肥料小麥生產可以增加百分之十五。又歐美各國利用化學肥料，可以增加產量百分之十五至百分之五十，所以我國施用肥料，對於質和量都應當加以改進。施肥應當適足其量，使地力可以適當保持；並且對於肥料三要素成分的配合，應得其宜使地力可以增進。此後應從速分析全國的土壤，舉行全國肥料試騐，方纔可以規定化學肥料最適用的區域，並且改良天然肥料，發展國產硫酸錏，和其他的人造肥料，藉以抵制舶來品的侵入，此外對於肥料三要素成分的配合，以及施肥時期和方法的改良等等，亦應詳細硏究，方可推行　利。</p>

<h3>Real Politics and the People's Demands</h3>
<p>Everywhere now, one can see and hear the slogans and banners of "Strengthening Sino-Japanese cooperation" and "Striving for the victory of the Greater East Asia War." Of course, these are all correct and are the greatest goals we should strive for today. However, if we truly want to achieve them, it is definitely not a matter of just shouting slogans and writing them down. First, we must examine the real politics. Only when the real politics are developing in this direction, are conducive to strengthening Sino-Japanese cooperation, and are conducive to striving for the victory of the Greater East Asia War, can there be practical results. Otherwise, if we ignore real politics and only sing slogans, everything will inevitably fall through.</p>
<p>Of course, the examination of real politics is not something that can be easily asserted. First, we must grasp the time factor. Time is merciless. It reflects the most truthful picture of human activities. No matter how good one is at embellishing, one cannot escape the test of time. Time is also the most realistic. Often, a certain policy may be considered appropriate at one time, but inappropriate at another. Also, what was once a bad policy may be considered a good policy at another time. Therefore, when we examine real politics, we must pay attention to the time factor. Second, we must grasp the spatial factor, that is, the geographical conditions, national conditions, and the uniqueness of the ethnic groups, because often what can be smoothly implemented and effective in country A may inevitably become incompatible in country B. What is a political policy that adapts to the demands of the people in place A may only increase the suffering of the people in place B and be difficult to achieve practical results. Third, we must also grasp the international factor, because the current war and the post-war new order construction are not only a total war in one country, but also a totalitarian war internationally, requiring the gathering of the total strength of various countries to strive for the realization of common goals. Therefore, when we examine real politics, if we only know the temporary convenience of our own country and ignore the common interests of the whole, we will naturally not be able to obtain correct conclusions. In addition to the above three major principles, of course, we must also adhere to the basic principles of discussing matters and not people, and valuing facts over emotions when examining. Otherwise, it is inevitable that "a slight deviation can lead to a great error."</p>
<p>Based on the above principles, let us try to examine the real politics in the peaceful areas. The most obvious defects seem to be the following. In terms of spirit, although there are many people in the peaceful area government who hold firm beliefs in the final success of the peace movement, to be honest, the vast majority lack correct beliefs. Most of them hold a kind of wrong idea, thinking that the current political situation in the peaceful area is definitely not long-lasting, and there will be another change in the near future. Based on this wrong concept, what is manifested in reality is: 1. They do not have a clear understanding of their responsibilities, thinking that they are just making a living and only thinking about their personal lives, so they lack a sense of responsibility. 2. They have a "five-day capital magistrate" mentality towards their duties. The upper ones "only seek to avoid mistakes and do not seek merit," and the lower ones adhere to the philosophy of muddling through, taking it one day at a time. 3. Since they have no belief in the future and only consider their personal interests, they inevitably use their power for personal gain and engage in corruption. Therefore, we dare to assert that if the belief in the success of peace is not established, then we cannot seek political clarity, and if politics is not clear, then all national policies will fall through.</p>
<p>Secondly, expert politics and clean politics are the prerequisites for a country's politics to get on the right track, and the National Government has always been working to promote its realization in this regard. However, based on the facts of the past few years, apart from some phenomena, it generally cannot fully meet the ideal. It is not only that, but there are also opposite facts! In terms of expert politics, to be honest, in the current peaceful area, most of those with real talent and solid reputation have not participated in politics. If we completely attribute this to such people having deep-seated prejudices and being unwilling to participate, we really cannot believe it. On the contrary, we see that as long as one can find connections and is good at speculation, one does not have to worry about not being able to become an official. As a result, the government is filled with a general group of ignorant and incompetent people. The upper ones create a bureaucratic political atmosphere, which is the main factor hindering political progress, and the lower ones inevitably spread the habits of the marketplace, taking pride in being good at seeking personal gain and regarding cunning and changeability as intelligence. Another greater reason is that the salaries received by general civil servants are not enough to support incorruptibility. People are not all sages, so it is unrealistic to expect what even sages cannot do. What is the use of constantly talking about eliminating corruption and practicing integrity?</p>
<p>Active political facilities are the basic elements for a country's politics to get on the right track. Therefore, grasping the hearts of the people, absorbing talents, and realizing national policies all depend on this. However, if we review the real politics in the peaceful area in recent years, how many of them can be called active and constructive political facilities? Of course, due to the existence of international and domestic wars, and due to the existence of special circumstances in various places, we have not made harsh demands on the government. However, from the proportion of all political facilities, passive facilities account for an absolutely large amount, while active facilities have almost no significant position. This often has a significant impact on the psychology of the people and the promotion of national policies.</p>
<p>The shortcomings of real politics often create a gap between the government and the people, hindering the implementation of national policies. The people's demands are originally very simple. The first, and also the most important, is to realize a life of peace and prosperity. The so-called life of peace and prosperity does not mean demanding enjoyment, but only demanding that politics get on the right track, that there be good politics, that the people's minimum living standards be guaranteed, and that work and careers can proceed normally. Second, it is to demand that the authorities pay special attention to production industries. For the sake of war, the people certainly have to abide by all regulations and restrictions, but what is especially important is to demand an increase in materials, first of all to demand the development of production industries. This is not only a prerequisite for improving people's livelihoods, but also a prerequisite for improving politics and implementing national policies. Third, the people have always been in a purely governed position, with no right to participate in politics and no room to express their opinions. Today, the people certainly do not want to realize constitutional government during the war, but how to realize local autonomy, how to establish public opinion institutions, how to maintain close ties between the people and the government, and how to create a new atmosphere of "officials and people as one" are the common demands of today.</p>
<p>Today, international situations and national realities do not need any high-sounding talk, but only demand that we pay attention to real politics, improve real politics, and satisfy the people's demands. Because only in this way can we realize the cooperation between the government and the people, can we realize the concentration of national power, can we demand the implementation of national policies, and can we talk about strengthening Sino-Japanese cooperation and striving for the victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Buenos Aires, 6th - According to a dispatch from London, the Undersecretary of the British Intelligence Department, Sattell, while attending the opening ceremony of the Military Exhibition here on the 5th, spoke about the future of the Pacific War, saying: The battle is raging in the Pacific, and the anti-Axis forces must recapture the vast tropical region from the hands of the Japanese. However, this is not easy. The Japanese army has occupied a vast area, and has prepared a favorable posture in terms of economy and strategy. Therefore, it will be difficult for the anti-Axis forces to recapture these areas even if they use all their strength.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th - According to a dispatch from a certain base in the South Pacific, the enemy air force in the South Pacific, on the 4th, used a joint formation of 58 aircraft, including unified B24 heavy bombers, BA33 long-range seaborne patrol interceptors, P38, P40, and F4W fighter-bombers, to attack the Japanese positions in the eastern part of Bougainville Island. The Japanese fighters immediately counterattacked fiercely, and immediately shot down five P38s, one E4w, and three B24s, for a total of nine (two of which were unconfirmed). In this battle, the Japanese army also lost one aircraft, but all the pilots were rescued.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Argentina, 6th - According to a dispatch from Chicago, Jiang Telle, the head of the US war front inspection delegation, when passing through Chicago on his way to Washington after returning from China, met with a group of reporters and pointed out that the Pacific War is in danger of becoming a protracted war. He said: If the United States does not transfer sufficient reinforcements and start a general offensive on Makassar at this time, the Japanese front will become increasingly strengthened, and the Pacific War is in danger of becoming a protracted war. However, Britain not only does not provide sufficient assistance to the US military on the Pacific front, but also has no intention of starting an offensive on the China and Burma fronts. If Britain delays any longer, the United States will have to start the offensive in place of the British army. Jiang Telle also discussed the European war situation, saying briefly: It is impossible for the anti-Axis forces to invade Europe from the French coast.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Launched an Annihilation War Near Guangde, Japanese Army Achieved Great Results in the Five Lakes Area</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th - The elite units of the Japanese army are currently launching an encirclement and annihilation war against the Chongqing "Loyal Patriotic Army" in the Taihu Lake area. After occupying Guangde, the base of the Chongqing army, its remnants have fallen into the encirclement. Currently, with the northern foot of Sanshou Mountain as the center, fierce annihilation wars are being launched everywhere. The fate of 30,000 Chongqing soldiers is in danger. After the Japanese rapid unit occupied Guangde on the night of the 2nd, it swept away the remnants in the vicinity on the 3rd and 4th, and completely destroyed the Chongqing military facilities. Other units advanced from the north and the west of Taihu Lake, completely encircling Wu Shi'an of the Second Advance Team and a part of the Fourth Team of the Chongqing forces. Starting from the morning of the 4th, the eastern troops compressed the encirclement southward, giving the enemy a devastating blow. Another unit arrived on the south side of Guangde on the 3rd, and continued its fierce attack on the 4th. In the afternoon of the same day, the Chongqing army in a certain place was surrounded, completing the outer encirclement of the encirclement circle, and a fierce annihilation war is currently underway. Another unit echoed this and forced itself behind Guangde, sweeping the area near Wangling (15 kilometers south of Guangde), where the headquarters of the "Loyal Patriotic Army" is located, and Longkou Village (8 kilometers south of Guangde). The Chongqing army was surrounded on all sides by the Japanese army, and has become rats in a bag, in extreme embarrassment.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, A Certain Place on the Chinese Front, 6th - The elite units of the Japanese army previously attacked 30,000 members of the Chongqing Loyal Patriotic Army in the Five Lakes area, and on the 5th, continued to compress the encirclement and annihilate the defeated Chongqing army everywhere, giving them individual blows. In particular, the Japanese rapid unit that captured Guangde urgently pursued the enemy army, once occupied Sian Town, and the Japanese units advancing from Wuhu towards Shangpeibu are currently suppressing a part of the 16th Brigade of the New Fourth Army that is waiting for an opportunity to launch. A certain unit of the Japanese army is carrying out suppression in Liyang, so the Five Lakes area will be gradually brightened and improved as the Japanese army's operations progress.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th - According to reports from the Japanese front in Jiangnan, the new operation launched by the Japanese army in the Five Lakes area has now reached its climax. Guangde, an important base of the Chongqing army, has been occupied. This operation has made many contributions to the construction of the New China, enabling the government's political power to be extended, promoting the Qingxiang (Pacification) work, and obtaining resources, which is worthy of attention. According to the security of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, thanks to the past Qingxiang work of the National Government and the continuous implementation of suppression operations by the Japanese army, it has been able to maintain a good condition, but the Chongqing army still seizes opportunities from time to time to engage in espionage work. Recently, its actions have become increasingly active, causing the lives of farmers in the vicinity to become uneasy, which has hindered the government's efforts to extend its political power. However, due to this operation, these restless areas have been completely suppressed. The security of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River will soon be rapidly restored, and the stability of the people's livelihood in the Five Lakes area is worthy of expectation. At the same time, the Qingxiang work implemented by the government in Zhejiang Province can also be rapidly advanced due to this operation. Moreover, the resources and agricultural products in this area, such as rice, wheat, and cotton, are the richest in Central China, so the supply of food and materials can be expected in the future. In addition, the circulation of materials is also gradually becoming active. Moreover, the reserves of iron and coal in this area are also quite abundant, so the operation area will soon become a resource treasure for China and Japan during the war. The harvest from this operation is indeed great.</p>

<h3>Deputy Finance Minister Chen Zhishuo Talks to Reporters</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th - Deputy Minister of Finance Chen Zhishuo recently answered questions from the Central News Agency reporters in detail as follows: Starting in October, Japanese nationals will pay taxes to the National Government in accordance with regulations. May I ask what is the amount of this tax revenue? Answer: Japanese nationals have been paying various taxes in accordance with our country's tax laws since October 1st, which is of great significance to the integrity of our country's national rights, and good results are expected. As for the tax revenue figures, they will be calculated after they are transferred to the ministry. May I ask how the Executive Yuan's announcement of the method of restricting the collection of taxes and levies in various provinces and cities will benefit the rural economy? Answer: Since the National Government returned to the capital in the 29th year of the Republic of China, this ministry has requested the Executive Yuan to abolish the harsh taxes and levies in various places, and the ministry has supervised and directed the implementation, and instructed compliance. However, if there are cases of levies at the lower levels, this ministry will correct them in a timely manner. As for the Executive Yuan's announcement of the method of restricting the collection of taxes and levies in various provinces and cities this time, it was originally intended to pay attention to people's livelihood, and it will greatly benefit the rural economy. It is attached that, regarding land taxes, this ministry drafted the Provisional Regulations on the Collection of Land Taxes in Various Provinces and Cities during the Extraordinary Period last December. All tax amounts are stipulated to be 1% of the current land price. All land tax surcharges or enemy donations, and all other surcharges, are suspended. This was approved by the Executive Yuan and notified for compliance. The Provisional Measures for Supervising Local Finance and the Implementing Rules thereof were promulgated in April of the 18th year and August of the 22nd year and are still being implemented. After the Central Reserve Bank and the United Bank signed the third remittance contract, the circulation of finance between the north and the south has benefited greatly. May I ask whether this method is temporary in nature, and whether the north-south currency problem will be further integrated as a result? Answer: The nature of the remittance contract signed by the Central Reserve Bank and the United Bank is to facilitate the circulation of finance between the north and the south and to meet actual needs. It cannot be described as a temporary measure, nor is it appropriate to predetermine the implementation period. However, the circulation of currency will inevitably be further advanced, without saying more.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Cultural Communication Has Entered the Right Track, The Two Countries Decided to Exchange Writers for the First Time</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th - At the current stage, Sino-Japanese cultural communication has gradually entered the right track. The two countries have decided to exchange first-class writers and new scholars for the first time, but this move was not decided at the Second Congress of Writers. Cases that have not been resolved for decades or even hundreds of years will be gradually resolved here, so its meaning is profound and significant. The Japan Literary Patriotic Society is responsible for the selection of personnel and other negotiations. The Japanese writers to be sent to China have been internally decided as Abe Tomoji, Oda Takeo, Kubota Mantaro, and Hayashi Hideo. Shanghai is planning to include Yoshino Nobuko and Mafune Mitsuo. Beijing is planning to include six people, and at least one more person will be sent to Shanghai and Beijing as a permanent resident. The first-class personnel sent to Japan by China for the first time are Tao Kangde and Xu Bailin, both of whom are new Chinese writers who attended the Second Congress of Writers, and both are currently in Tokyo. Tao Kangde is studying Japanese general culture, and Xu is specializing in Chinese studies at the Tokyo Imperial University Research Institute. In addition to the exchange of writers, it was also decided to exchange Sino-Japanese cultural researchers at the same time. The Japanese side sent Kiyomizu Shin, a graduate of the Department of Literature of Meiji University, to Beijing for research. The Chinese side sent Xu Shouzhong and Song Guiying, graduates of the Faculty of Arts of Peking University, who are about to come to Japan. In addition, Kume Masao, the secretary-general of the Japan Literary Patriotic Society, is scheduled to go to China on the 20th of this month to handle the exchange of these scholars and prepare for the Writers' Congress to be held next year. The trip will last about a week.</p>
<h3>Head of the Thai Military Delegation Expresses His Impressions of Visiting Japan</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Bangkok, 6th - The head of the Thai military delegation to Japan, Lieutenant General Pechide, specially met with the Japanese press corps here on the morning of the 5th to express his impressions of the trip as follows: The main purpose of this visit to Japan was to inspect the military of the friendly nation, but I believe that not only military matters, but all matters are intended to use this trip to enhance cooperation and kinship with Japan. During the time in Japan, I was warmly welcomed and generously entertained by Japanese people from all over the country. I was particularly grateful. During my stay in Tokyo for about two weeks, I met with Prime Minister Tojo and the heads of the Japanese army and navy to exchange various opinions. In addition, I also visited various military factories in detail. What impressed me most when visiting the Japanese military industry was that Japan is determined not to rely on foreign forces for this holy war. The materials and technology are all self-sufficient. In particular, after visiting the aircraft factory and the shipyard, I deeply felt that I had full confidence in the massive production capacity of Japanese industry. I also got to see the manufacturing situation of a certain warship. Also, when I visited the Akino Aviation School, I saw that the combat training of Japanese army pilots was most commendable. This training exercise was entirely for air combat. On the way back, I visited the battlefields of Malaysia and the Southern Islands. When I recalled the spirit of bravery and the heart-stirring battle results of the Japanese army in this Greater East Asia War, I could not help but sigh. In short, this trip made me more confident in Japan's military strength, and I deeply felt that I would fight together with Japan to the final victory, and I was deeply confident in the victory of this war.</p>
<h3>Governor-General Decoux of Vietnam Writes on Foreign Relations; Vietnam Actively Pursues Cotton Production Increase</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - "Yomiuri Shimbun" recently published an article by Governor-General Decoux of Vietnam, titled "Vietnam in East Asia," the main points of which are as follows: Vietnam's foreign relations, especially its relations with Asian neighbors, have been deeply affected since the outbreak of this World War. In fact, Vietnam's communication with Europe and the United States has been cut off, but its political machinery has not changed as a result. Vietnam's culture and economy have close ties with East Asian countries, and these ties are becoming increasingly close. The restoration of trade between civilized countries around the world must meet all the conditions for progress, which is well known to us. It is expected that when global trade is restored, it will not hinder trade between East Asian nations and this region, but rather promote it. Therefore, I believe that Vietnam's current situation is very clear. The Governor-General's Office of Vietnam is determined to protect and secure the happiness of Annam, which constitutes the Indochina Union, in the name of France. Therefore, Vietnam adopts an independent attitude, but this does not mean isolation, because Vietnam has cooperated with Japan as a member of East Asia to build a new order in Greater East Asia. At the same time, the Governor-General's Office of Vietnam is determined to be loyal to the French government and to fulfill its promises to Japan. It is expected that political cooperation with Japan will yield supreme results, and this spirit of cooperation will be fully demonstrated in the economic field. When this economic agreement is implemented, Vietnam will export a large number of various materials to East Asia, especially to Japan, mainly rice and corn. The price Vietnam receives will be used to supply materials that are insufficient domestically. However, during this wartime, although Japan wants to supply as much as possible to Vietnam, it is not very smooth. This is indeed a major problem. To solve this problem, it is necessary to enhance Vietnam's productivity. Therefore, today, Vietnam not only needs to make up for its own material shortages but should also strive to produce for the entire Greater East Asia. Currently, Vietnam is working hard to produce fuel for engines and alternative lubricating oils. Secondly, regarding Vietnam's increased cotton production, the raw materials necessary for general clothing should be supplied to industrial and handicraft workers in various regions. In addition to increasing agricultural production, Vietnam also needs to strive to manufacture industrial products. Significant results have been achieved in the production of lubricating oil, alcohol, and dissolving oil. At the same time, investigations have begun on the production of chemical products and chemicals, and research is being conducted on important materials in Vietnam. Because the quantity is limited, strict regulations must be set for their utilization. A distribution system has been adopted for imported materials. In summary, Vietnam is now working hard to cooperate with the war and has adopted comprehensive countermeasures to use general mechanisms, fully exploit Vietnam's resource capabilities, improve the living standards of the people, and seek prosperity in both material and spiritual aspects. This is also the mission that Vietnam owes to its motherland, France.</p>
<p>Saigon, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Vietnamese authorities and the local Japanese military authorities have conducted various studies on the issue of establishing a self-sufficient system in Vietnam. In terms of Vietnam's objective conditions, it has been confirmed that increasing cotton production is the key to solving this problem. According to statistics, Vietnam exported 50 million tons of cotton yarn in 1913. Unfortunately, it failed to compete with American and Egyptian cotton, and production gradually decreased. Before this World War, it was reduced to the minimum quantity. However, according to past statistics, the Vietnamese cotton industry is still promising. Therefore, the authorities are now preparing to actively increase production, expand the planting area, and implement concrete measures such as increasing cotton prices.</p>
<h3>Twenty-Three Enemy Aircraft Attack Ambon Unsuccessfully</h3>

<h3>German Army Builds a Back-to-the-River Defense Line Along the Dnieper River; Launches Fierce Counterattack Along the Entire Front</h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to Captain Seiltlitz, a well-known German military commentator, who spoke on the evening of the 5th about the Eastern Front, the German High Command has decided to stop retreating after the German army reaches the Dnieper River.</p>
<p>Argentine City, 6th (Central News Agency) - After the German military authorities announced the end of the retreat on the Eastern Front, they built a back-to-the-river defense line along the Dnieper River and launched a fierce counterattack along the entire front, not allowing the Soviet army to advance a single step. The situation on the Dnieper River has fallen into a stalemate. The Soviet army's official newspaper, "Red Star," admitted to the large-scale German counterattack and hoped that the Soviet soldiers would rise up, saying that if the German counterattack is not repelled, the Soviet army's offensive efforts will not succeed. According to German sources, there is still fierce fighting on the Smolensk-Vitebsk highway, and it is reported that the German army has broken into the Soviet army's position at that location.</p>
<p>Both Armies Fight to the Death for Bridgeheads</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: Although the general situation in the war zones west of Smolensk and northwest of Temidov remains unchanged, the German army fighting in the area made further progress on land on Monday, especially after fierce hand-to-hand combat, the Soviet army's counterattacks were repelled several times. Fierce fighting broke out again along both sides of the Orsha-Smolensk highway. The Soviet army attacked and broke through several local gaps, but the German reserves quickly filled them. German artillery and aircraft cooperated to destroy the Soviet columns in progress, making a great contribution to the war in the area. There was more activity on the northern part of the Eastern Front on Monday, especially south of Lake Ilmen, where the Soviet army was frequently mobilized and effectively bombarded by the German army. On the Volkhov Front, the Soviet army's daring attacks by powerful shock troops were detected and suppressed by the German army in time. South of Lake Ladoga, the Soviet army attempted to block the German army's efforts to straighten the line of defense but was repelled by the German army and failed to achieve its goal. At the same time, German reconnaissance teams reported that the enemy was reorganizing its forces near the front line north of the Sea of Azov. Disregarding the heavy losses suffered in the previous days, the Soviet army is clearly planning to launch another offensive.</p>
<p>Improvement of German Positions in the South</p>
<p>South of Melitopol, the German army repelled the Soviet army's offensive and captured a mountain fortress, thus greatly improving its position. Another offensive launched by the Soviet army on the northern wing of the Melitopol bridgehead was thwarted under the heavy artillery fire of the German defense. Although the Chaplyuk bridgehead was the site of activity on Sunday evening, it was not attacked by the Soviet army on Monday. However, fierce fighting took place northwest of Niepropetrovsk, where one side of the river was heavily bombarded on the evening of that day. The Soviet army landed reinforcements on the opposite bank of the Dnieper River in an attempt to recover the territory previously lost. Fierce fighting took place all night, but the Soviet army did not gain an inch. The Soviet army also repeatedly attempted to secure new bridgeheads and landing points along a front of hundreds of kilometers between the central Dnieper River and the mouth of the Pripyat River, but all attempts were thwarted. A group of German forces, including tanks and mechanized units, occupied the town of Chernobyl in the Pripyat River estuary lowlands and also crossed the river to defend its bridgehead. The Soviet army's repeated attacks failed. The new defensive successes achieved by the German army on the Taman Peninsula were even more significant, because on Monday the Soviet army launched several infantry divisions and a tank brigade in an attempt to break through the German army's main line of defense. However, due to the small war zone, it was unable to deploy its forces and had to attack the German position in dense formations. The German army suffered heavy losses and did not give up its attempt, but the enemy's fierce attack finally collapsed under German artillery fire and German air raids.</p>
<p>German Army Strategically Utilizes Time Factor on Eastern Front</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to the Havas News Agency, Lieutenant General Dittmar, a German military expert, gave a speech on the limits of the German army's avoidance of battle on the Eastern Front, stating that not only are favorable natural terrains necessary, but also convenience for future actions. The shortening of transportation lines and the dense network of rivers and marshes in western Russia are favorable conditions for stabilizing the situation. After several days of fierce attacks, the Soviet army has suffered extremely heavy losses and its strength has weakened. In addition, we are using a scorched-earth policy to deal with those who once taught us this method, but this is not a decisive factor. The shortening of the front line must be premised on the balance between one's own military strength and the other side's military strength and the length of its transportation lines. For the past two years, the German army on the Eastern Front has been fighting with fewer troops against more, especially in recent months. The Soviet side has launched a fierce offensive with all its forces this summer, and its number of soldiers is many times greater than ours, but since they were assembled in a short period of time, training is inevitably somewhat lacking. After more than two years of arduous combat, the German army has penetrated deep into enemy territory and still holds a favorable position for offense and defense. The battles in Eastern and Southern Europe fully demonstrate the German army's perseverance. Whether the acquisition of the time factor is beneficial depends on whether the acquirer can make good use of it. Whether in Eastern or Southern Europe, Germany is fighting for time, and is also making good use of this time to develop its amazing scientific talents in exchange for concrete achievements in battle.</p>
<h3>Strong German Defenses on the East Coast of the Adriatic Sea; Anti-Axis Aircraft Attack Greece Unsuccessfully</h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - As the war in southern Italy progresses, the anti-Axis forces are carrying out landing operations in Albania and Greece. The German military authorities issued a statement on the 6th to explain the strength of the German front line in that area, stating that the eastern Adriatic region, especially within Greece and Albania facing the Strait of Otranto, has become stable due to the strong operations of the German army. Since the German army recently occupied various island cities, the occupied area has been further expanded, and the cooperation of the Albanian natives with the German army has remained unwavering.</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - The German Air Force authorities announced on the 6th that anti-Axis air forces attacked German air bases in Greece on the 5th. German fighter squadrons immediately intercepted them, shooting down seven heavy bombers with four engines. The enemy aircraft fled without reaching their destination.</p>

<h3>British Forces Advance on the Plains on the East Coast of Italy; Encounter Fierce Attacks by German Forces</h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to military reporter Cetorius of the Havas News Agency, there were no major changes in the war situation on the four fronts of southern Italy on the previous day. The enemy forces apparently dispatched troops from the Naples area to prepare for continued advancement. The enemy's vanguard was blocked by the German rearguard on the plains between Naples and Volturno. The right wing of the American Fifth Army in the interior intensified its northward attack, attempting to cross Benevento. The American tank corps still encountered difficulties in the mountainous areas, and the German rearguard prevented the enemy from advancing, preventing them from exceeding the speed predetermined by the German High Command. The right wing of the British Eighth Army advanced northward and reached the town of Batolomio. A portion of the British Eighth Army in the middle turned westward, where the war situation was not fierce. The British forces advancing along the Adriatic coastal plain and the British forces landing near Termoli were attacked by the German army. The enemy clearly wanted to encircle by landing north of Termoli, and the war situation there deserves special attention.</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - A formation of fast fighter-bombers of the Air Force launched a fierce bombing raid on the British bridgehead of Termoli on the east coast of Italy on the 4th, causing great damage to the landing facilities and landing craft, and destroying four heavy artillery pieces.</p>
<p>US Fifth Army's Northern Advance Obstructed</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: On Monday, the battle in southern Italy was primarily focused on troops stationed on the eastern coast and near the Apennine Mountains. West of this area, as far as the lowlands of Campania, military actions were limited to small skirmishes between German rearguard units and British and American reconnaissance squads. The enemy's attempt to break through the German lines between Benevento and Volturara was completely unsuccessful. The enemy is still facing the wide and deep German defense zone. The German army is moving to higher mountainous areas according to plan, and has not been obstructed by the British and American forces. The German rearguard units ordered to withdraw from Benevento prevented the enemy from creating any gaps in the German lines. In this military action, the powerful American reconnaissance squad suffered heavy losses, especially southwest of Benevento in locations such as Telese Terme and Airola. The enemy planned to pass through the highway leading to the lowlands of Campania, but after losing approximately 500 armored reconnaissance vehicles and a large number of soldiers, they retreated in disarray. After making no gains in other areas, the British Eighth Army intensified its efforts to advance eastward. Localized fierce battles broke out in the Foggia lowlands and the mountainous and coastal areas. East of Volturara, east of Larino, and near the coast of Termoli, the British army intensified its offensive, and the German army put up a strong resistance. The Canadian troops fighting near Volturara stopped their attempt to break through after losing four "Sherman" tanks and suffering heavy casualties. Under the cover of tanks, the British army attempted to advance east of Larino, but was met with a German flanking attack. Their vanguard units were subjected to accurate German fire, resulting in many casualties.</p>
<p>Sweeping Operations Behind the Lines Yield Results</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: The German army's mopping-up operation in northern Italy has been a great success. In the Trieste area, 13,000 guerrillas were captured. In the past three days of operations, 1,100 guerrillas have been killed on the battlefield in Istria. Many of Badoglio's subordinates have been killed or captured. The German army has also seized many light and heavy weapons, as well as motorcycles, fuel depots, mountain guns, and anti-aircraft guns that were formerly owned by the Italian army and had recently been surrendered or delivered to the hands of the insurgents. The mopping-up operation is now progressing towards the coast, and the mopping-up operation in the Slovenian region has also been very successful. Clearing the mountains and transportation lines was successful on Sunday and eliminated many guerrillas.</p>
<h3>German Troops Landing on Kos Island Launch Sweeping Operations</h3>
<p>One Anti-Axis Cargo Ship Sunk</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to Havas News Agency, German military circles announced yesterday that after German troops landed on and occupied Kos Island, north of the Dodecanese Islands, on October 4th, they began sweeping operations, which are still in progress. In addition to capturing 600 British soldiers and 2,500 Badoglio troops, the German army seized 40 artillery pieces, 11 aircraft, and one ship, and another 11 enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground.</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - Military circles announced last night that German bombers patrolling the southern Aegean Sea on Monday discovered an anti-Axis cargo ship of approximately 4,500 tons. They immediately attacked the ship, causing it to catch fire and suffer heavy damage. The ship attempted to take refuge in a bay on a small island in the Dodecanese Islands, but was eventually hit several times and caught fire. It was quickly enveloped in thick smoke, and it can be presumed that it has been lost. At the same time, German anti-aircraft units in the Aegean region also shot down three anti-Axis bombers on Monday.</p>
<p>German Troop Withdrawal from Corsica and Sardinia</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - Within 18 days, German transport planes and naval vessels evacuated approximately 30,000 German troops from Sardinia and Corsica to Italy, along with 16,000 tons of military supplies, 6,000 transport vehicles, and many other artillery pieces and tanks. All of the evacuated forces were used to reinforce the German front line in Italy. During the withdrawal, the German army suffered only 250 deaths, and lost 25 transport planes and a small number of transport ships.</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a naval reporter from Havas News Agency, the German army's withdrawal from Corsica and Sardinia has been completed. All German troops dispatched to those islands to assist the Italian army have now safely returned to the Italian mainland with all of their war equipment and supplies. The task of transporting the German troops back to the Italian mainland was undertaken by the German army. The German Navy, with its ingenious tactics, finally solved this extremely difficult problem. The mutiny of Badoglio's government made it impossible for the German troops stationed on Corsica and Sardinia to remain there for a single day. The German High Command, faced with the sudden changes in the situation in the Mediterranean, decisively abandoned Corsica and Sardinia. The withdrawal operation began with Sardinia. The German armored division and other units stationed on the island boarded small ships and sailed across the narrow Strait of Bonifacio. The attempt by Italian destroyers to prevent the passage of the ships completely failed. One Italian destroyer was damaged by German coastal artillery. The withdrawal from Sardinia was completely successful in nine days, which is due to the skill of German Rear Admiral Jürgen, who had previously solved the transportation problem during the North African campaign and achieved great success. The passage of ships across the Strait of Bonifacio was only interrupted once, but the withdrawal was successfully completed on September 17. The withdrawal from Corsica was more difficult than the withdrawal from Sardinia. The treacherous waves of the Mediterranean presented a considerable obstacle to the withdrawal operation, and only a small number of Italian ships were available for dispatch. Italian crew members leaving the ships had to be replaced by German crew members, and all of the difficulties were resolved by the German authorities. Although German transport ships were attacked by submarines and other warships en route, they eventually arrived in Italy. The German troops suffered no losses when boarding ships in Bastia and landing at ports in Italy.</p>

<h3>Military Supplies Ministry and Production Administration (2)</h3>
<p>What kind of content and character the newly established Military Supplies Ministry will possess depends on the cooperation between the government and the people in the future, and cannot be predicted at present. At this time, it may be somewhat meaningful for us to examine the production administrative organizations of Germany, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and to review the entity of the Military Supplies Ministry's organization. Of course, due to the significant differences in national conditions and production circumstances, it should be remembered that the organization of any country cannot be completely transferred to Japan as is.</p>
<h3>Germany</h3>
<p>The Allied nation of Germany convened the Supreme National Defense Council, also known as the War Cabinet, at the end of August 1939. This was the highest deliberative body concerning the war economy. Marshal Göring, the head of the Four-Year Plan, was appointed chairman. The members included Interior Minister Frick (recently reassigned), Economic Minister Funk, the Führer's representative (currently vacant), General Superintendent of the Armed Forces Keitel, and Head of the Reich Chancellery Lammers, totaling five members. Their task was to coordinate the economic, political, and military aspects of the war. An affiliated body of the Supreme National Defense Council was the Supreme Council for War Economy (established in December 1939), chaired by Marshal Göring, with Korner, the Deputy Commissioner of the Four-Year Plan, as acting chairman. The deputy ministers of the Ministries of Economy, Food, Labor, Transportation, and Interior, the deputy director of the Central Forestry Bureau, members of the Price Review Committee, the director of the Quartermaster General's Department of the Armed Forces, and party representatives served as members. Its goal was to streamline the operation of the war economy. Thus, Marshal Göring, in his capacity as the head of the Four-Year Plan, held full authority over the economic system and also served as chairman of both the Supreme National Defense Council and the Supreme Council for War Economy, thereby occupying the position of commander-in-chief of the war economy.</p>
<h3>Contents of the Four-Year Plan</h3>
<p>To realistically exercise the full authority he had acquired, the head of the Four-Year Plan established the Central Planning Board within the Four-Year Plan Office as the highest executive body, appointing Minister of Armaments Speer, Deputy Commissioner of the Four-Year Plan Korner, and Deputy Air Minister Milch as members. The tasks of the board were to:</p>
<p>Determine the outline for the allocation of raw materials and resources,</p>
<p>Determine the materials that should be prioritized for production,</p>
<p>Determine the sectors in the basic materials industry and processing industry that should be expanded.</p>
<p>The actual power of the board rested with Minister of Armaments Speer, so the Minister of Armaments held the position of operating the war economy with direct authority as the head of the Four-Year Plan. The Minister of Armaments began to attract the attention of the general public from this point onward. The German Minister of Armaments (correctly speaking, the initial title was Minister of Weapons and Munitions) was appointed by a Führer decree on March 17, 1940. The first minister was Dr. Todt, the General Inspector of German Road Construction.</p>
<p>His task was to maximize the efficiency of all organizations engaged in the production of weapons and ammunition, and to implement supervision of the production of military supplies for the purpose of overall control. The Minister of Armaments had full authority to issue all necessary orders in the execution of his duties. As a result, the relevant agencies of military officers were placed under the command of the Minister of Armaments (appointing managing officers of the Armaments Ministry where necessary). Changes in personnel in organizations involved in the production of military supplies required the consent of the Minister of Armaments, and it was also stipulated that the relevant agencies had an obligation to provide all necessary reports at the request of the Minister of Armaments. However, at the beginning of the appointment of the Minister of Armaments, the allocation of military supplies was under the jurisdiction of the Quartermaster General's Department of the Armed Forces, and the planning of raw materials was under the jurisdiction of the Four-Year Plan Office. General economic administration was under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Armaments, so the authority of the Minister of Armaments was not necessarily very strong. Later, in a certain month, the Minister of Armaments suddenly died in the line of duty. After Speer took office, with the establishment of the Central Planning Board, the authority of the Minister of Armaments was greatly expanded. He maintained contact with the Four-Year Plan Office through the board, and conversely, the Quartermaster General's Department of the Armed Forces (headed by General Thomas) was placed under the command of the Ministry of Armaments. Thus, all authority regarding military production was concentrated in his hands.</p>
<p>After Speer was appointed as the plenipotentiary for military production under the new Four-Year Plan, the authority of Economic Minister Funk, who was in charge of civil production, was temporarily and clearly divided. The authority and position of the Minister of Armaments were generally as described above, but on September of this year, it was greatly reformed again. Civil production, which was under the jurisdiction of Economic Minister Funk, was also placed under the direct control of the Minister of Armaments. Speer took charge of all military and civil production, and as a result, the title was formally changed to Minister of Armaments and Production, and he was appointed as the plenipotentiary commissioner of the Four-Year Plan.</p>
<p>At the same time, Economic Minister Funk was responsible for foreign trade, goods distribution, the commercial sector, and the financial sector, and participated in the Central Planning Board.</p>
<p>Thus, Minister of Armaments Speer is now the de facto commander of German military production. He is relatively young, not yet forty years old, and was formerly an architect. In addition to the aforementioned Armaments Bureau and Armaments Supervisory Office, the lower-level organizations of the Ministry of Armaments include:</p>
<p>Armaments Advisory Council—composed of five representatives from the Army and Navy, and representatives from civil society organizations, to advise the ministers.</p>
<p>Production Guidance Bureau—mobilizes production groups and guides committee regional executive officers, military administrative regions, and central technical committees to cooperate in organizing and undertaking production guidance. "Production groups" are established in each industry as self-governing production groups for business operators. The guidance committee members, who are the heads, are appointed by the government, and have achieved great results in improving production efficiency and technology. Regional executive officers and military administrative region executive officers are government supervisors, and the Central Technical Committee is a self-governing cooperative body for operators in the technical field.</p>
<p>General Affairs Bureau—responsible for liaison between departments.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned production group system, with the goal of establishing the "national character of enterprises," is of considerable reference value to our country. In short, the administrative organization of German production, with Hitler-Göring-Speer as the heads, is characterized by a concentrated, monolithic, and unique authority of the state.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Similarly, the administrative organization of production in the Soviet Union, also a monolithic state, is structured around a council system. The Soviet Union does not have a specific agency called the Ministry of Armaments. Many People's Commissariats related to industry are established in parallel. In order to control these many People's Commissariats, six industrial councils were established. The upper-level organization of these industrial councils is the Economic Council established in 1937, which has its current structure due to the reorganization in January 1940. The members of the Economic Council are as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman—Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars Stalin. Vice-Chairman—Vice-Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars. Members—Chairman of the Defense Committee (Voroshilov), People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, People's Commissar for Transportation, People's Commissar for Foreign Trade, Procurator General, Chairmen of the industrial councils, and Secretary-General of Labor Organizations.</p>
<p>The Economic Council belongs to the Council of People's Commissars of the Union (Cabinet), reviews the annual plans of the national economy, confirms various group review plans, and supervises and directs the operation of the economy. Based on these tasks, together with the State Planning Committee, which serves as a planning organization, it can be regarded as the central driving force of the war economy.</p>
<p>In this way, the Federal Council of People's Commissars—Economic Council—Industrial Councils—People's Commissars, and many other administrative bodies are established to be responsible for military production. Among these, the Industrial Councils are composed of three to five members. Members are not allowed to hold concurrent posts other than wartime duties in the State Planning Committee. The chairman and vice-chairman are selected from the deputy chairmen (twelve in total) of the People's Commissars. Each council has a special General Administration Bureau. The contents of the Industrial Councils are as follows:</p>
<h3>Contents of the Industrial Councils</h3>
<p>Industrial Council for Metals and Chemicals (People's Commissariats for non-ferrous metals industry, ferrous metals industry, and chemical industry, and the General Administration Bureau for Sulfite, Alcohol, and Hydrolysis Industries)</p>
<p>Industrial Council for Machinery Manufacturing (People's Commissariats for large machinery manufacturing, general machinery manufacturing, and electrical industry).</p>
<p>Industrial Council for Defense Industry (People's Commissariats for aviation industry, weapons manufacturing, ammunition manufacturing, and shipbuilding industry).</p>
<p>Industrial Council for Fuel and Energy Economy (People's Commissariats for the petroleum industry, coal industry, power generation industry, and fuel industry).</p>
<p>Industrial Council for Daily Necessities and Consumer Goods (People's Commissariats for textiles industry, garment industry, food industry, dairy industry, and fisheries industry).</p>
<p>Industrial Council for Agriculture and Procurement (People's Commissariats for agriculture and procurement). (From: Asahi Shimbun, four sections on October 1)</p>

Personnel have been re-assigned to investigate and stop the allocation of sugar that is not necessary for business purposes, and special sugar for various agencies and organizations will be suspended. Even the sugar needed by various industries will be reduced according to the nature of their business. The office is currently making adjustments and will submit them to the authorities for review before continuing the distribution. However, there are many special allocation customers, so it will be delayed until mid-month before distribution can be carried out in turn.</p>

<h3>Zhou Huarren Talks about the Affairs Bureau of the Cultural Association</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: Zhou Huarren, who is in charge of the Shanghai branch of the China-Japan Cultural Association after its reorganization, said: After the reorganization of this branch, its organization and work policies have been slightly changed compared to before. This branch has now adopted the affairs bureau system, with the general affairs, management, business planning, and other departments clearly defined, and the power is centralized. In the past, this branch rarely had any contact with society. In the future, cultural undertakings should be integrated with social life. In the future, all Chinese and Japanese cultural figures and artists should be solicited to join this branch and take joint responsibility. Now that the municipality has been unified, we should thoroughly eliminate the cultural ideas of Anglo-American liberal capitalism, establish cultural ideas based on East Asia, promote the communication between Chinese and Japanese cultures, promote the inherent culture of the East, and create a new culture of East Asia as the guiding principles. In short, under the leadership of Chairman Chen, the cultural circles of Shanghai will inevitably become more united and move towards the goals set in the reorganization declaration. We hope that the press will provide guidance from time to time.</p>
<h3>Renji Hall: Operating for Over Sixty Years, A Classical Charitable Institution</h3>
<p>Near the modernized Rue Edward VII, on the ordinary Yunnan Road, among the uneven array of shops large and small, stands a tall, temple-like old building. This is the renowned, nationally recognized, classical Chinese charitable organization—the Shanghai Renji Charitable Hall.</p>
<p>Sixty-One Years Ago</p>
<p>Stepping into the tall entrance, one sees the main hall and the second hall, which display the architectural art of China's recent past, especially the plaques, which evoke feelings of nostalgia. There is also the inscription of the three large characters "Renji Hall" written by Yu Yue (Quyuan). Mr. Xu Rusheng, who is currently in charge of the affairs of the hall, tells a truly captivating story about its history.</p>
<p>It was sixty-one years ago that a "Civilization Bureau" appeared near the Hong Temple on today's Nanjing Road. This was the predecessor of the Shanghai Renji Charitable Hall. The Civilization Bureau was engaged in social welfare undertakings, and its main tasks were: first, the cleaning movement of "cherishing and respecting written paper"; second, the children's enlightenment movement of opening "free schools"; and third, the public propaganda (moral persuasion) movement of holding "village covenants"; in addition, it was also dedicated to charitable undertakings such as caring for the poor and widows. In general, it was worthy of the name "Civilization Bureau" in its literal meaning.</p>
<p>At that time, charitable undertakings in Shanghai were still in a primitive state, mainly relying on the charitable words and deeds of individual philanthropists. There was no organization to speak of, and naturally no undertaking to speak of. However, the establishment of the Civilization Bureau gave Shanghai society a considerable stimulus. Because it met the actual needs of society, it gradually became necessary to expand the scope of its affairs. Therefore, it soon moved from Nanjing Road to North Sea Road and was renamed "Zhonghe Bureau," which was considerably larger. At the same time, it opened a free dispensary and pharmacy, becoming the largest provider of aid to the poor in Shanghai at that time.</p>
<p>The "Zhonghe Bureau's" charitable undertakings not only earned the gratitude of the general public, but also gained the trust of benevolent people, who believed that organized and planned charity was far more meaningful than individual and random acts of kindness. As a result, the amount of donations increased day by day. The leaders at the time, encouraged by this support from all walks of life, further enhanced their belief in serving society. At the same time, they felt that in order for charitable undertakings to be organized and planned, in addition to the high moral character of the managers, the organization itself must have a solid foundation in order to be maintained forever and not be interrupted midway. Therefore, they purchased the land on today's Yunnan Road to establish a permanent foundation. At the same time, they further expanded the scope of charitable undertakings, and the name was changed from "Zhonghe Hall" to "Renji Hall." This was still in the ninth year of the Guangxu reign. The affairs were managed by gentlemen such as Mr. Shi Shanchang, and the support of Governor Mai Yutao was also worth commemorating, setting a good example of the government and the people working together to carry out charitable undertakings forever.</p>
<p>After the Renji Hall opened in its new location at 35 Yunnan Road, the main charitable undertakings it carried out were: providing medical care, providing medicine, and caring for infants. In winter, it provided clothing, rice, and coffins, and cared for widows and the poor. For decades, it did not stop. At present, except for the provision of rice and coffins, which have been temporarily suspended due to practical impossibilities, other activities are still being carried out to the best of its ability. Moreover, when disasters occur in Shanghai and elsewhere, it also does its best to run around to solicit donations and provide assistance with its funds, showing its spirit of "feeling hungry when others are hungry" and "regarding all people as siblings." However, the central task at the moment is providing medical care and medicine.</p>
<p>In the morning, Renji Charitable Hall is already crowded with people. The main hall, the side hall, the courtyard, and the east wing are surrounded by all kinds of people sitting at tables. At first glance, one might almost suspect that they have gone to the wrong place and mistakenly entered some large teahouse or restaurant. However, there are no dazzling red and green costumes here, no nauseating smell of powder, cigarettes, and alcohol, and no soulless songs, laughter, or ramblings. It turns out that they are all poorly clad and sick people. The halls are crowded with people waiting for diagnosis and those receiving medicine. The north and south sides are the diagnosis rooms for internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, ophthalmology, acupuncture, and other departments. The four wings are the medicine dispensing sections.</p>
<p>Providing Medical Care and Medicine</p>
<p>Each doctor is surrounded by several tables of patients waiting for diagnosis. They carefully ask about their conditions and diagnose their illnesses. They even more carefully write diagnoses and prescriptions. Treating one patient often takes a lot of time, unlike the carelessness of general "famous doctors." Moreover, they are especially gentle in repeatedly guiding poor patients with limited knowledge, like a loving mother teaching her beloved daughter, without fearing tediousness, ensuring that the patient fully understands. A patient told the reporter: "Even if you pay a lot of money, you can't find a doctor as good as the ones in Renji Hall!"</p>
<p>The medicine dispensing section is just like an ordinary Chinese medicine store. Director Fang Pinzhang said that their goals are: first, to strive to purchase authentic medicinal materials; second, to be cautious in compounding and preparing medicines; and third, to ensure that the procedures for dispensing medicines according to the prescription are clear, avoiding omissions and errors. He led me to see the situation of poor patients receiving medicine. The staff members were working in an orderly manner, and their nimble hands and feet ensured that the medicine recipients did not have to wait for a long time. The staff members had a conscientious attitude towards their duties, but did not have an arrogant attitude!</p>
<p>He brought out a large stack of records of medical care and medicine dispensing. Taking the eight months of this year as an example, the minimum number of medical consultations was 2,034 in February, and the maximum was 8,192 in August. The minimum number of medicines dispensed was 499 in February, and the maximum was 6,891 doses in August. On average, the total number of medical consultations per month is around 5,000, and the number of medicines dispensed is around 4,500 doses. The total value of medicines dispensed from January to the end of August this year reached a huge sum of 115,000 yuan. The reason for the smaller numbers in January and February, in addition to seasonal factors, was that the hall was experiencing severe financial difficulties at the time and only provided assistance to the extremely poor, while those with some ability were advised to take care of themselves, so fewer medicines were dispensed. It is said that the numbers were extremely large in previous years, with the total number of medical consultations and medicines dispensed exceeding 120,000. Due to the inconvenience of transportation in recent years, most of those seeking medical care and medicine are local residents. However, the numbers are already considerable.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Renji Charitable Hall is now a purely non-governmental charitable organization. The upper-level organization is the board of directors and the board of supervisors, whose members are the most famous gentlemen in the city. The chairman of the board is Mr. Kai Yuting, the vice-chairmen are Mr. Huang Hanzhi and Mr. Zhao Ziqing, the managing directors are Mr. Zhu Yinjiang, Mr. Zhu Zichen, Mr. Lu Jiesun, and Mr. Wang Shuxian, and the directors also include Mr. Shi Shengzhi and eleven others. The standing supervisor is Mr. Zhu Zikui, and the supervisors are Mr. Zhu Zichen, Mr. Zhu Qichen, and Mr. Feng Bingliang.</p>
<p>Benevolent Heart and Benevolent Skills</p>
<p>The actual organization that handles the daily work of Renji Charitable Hall is relatively simple. In addition to the infant care section, which has a separate organization called "Renji Infant Care Hall," it is divided into three main parts: administrative affairs, medical care, and medicine dispensing. The administrative affairs department, including the accountant, has only three staff members. The director is Mr. Xu Rusheng, an honest and capable typical figure, who can promote large-scale undertakings with a small number of personnel. The medicine dispensing department has ten staff members working under the direction of Mr. Fang Pinzhang, who has been serving for more than twenty years. Every morning is the busiest time, and everyone hopes to have two extra pairs of hands to help, so as to avoid the anxiety of the poor and sick. And in the afternoon, they have to prepare medicines, so they are not idle either.</p>
<p>The medical care department is now divided into internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, ophthalmology, acupuncture, and other departments. Each department has a dedicated Chinese medicine doctor in charge. The internal medicine doctors include Qian Xiaopei, Xie Hongying, Zhang Ziqiu, Xie Daitao, Qian Shifang, Fang Boshi, Dong Changsong, Wu Mengying, and Lu Youxiang. Mr. Qian, Mr. Zhang, and Mr. Xie have been serving in the hall for more than ten years. The surgeons include Wang Yukang, Li Shengdong, and Wang Baoqing. The acupuncturists include Kuang Tingfang and Jiang Dianjing. The ophthalmologists include Yu Wanbang and Zhang Yingcai. The pediatricians include Zhu Peiyu and Sister Pan Xiudao from the Yangjingbang Orphanage; most of them have been serving in the hospital for more than ten years.</p>
<p>Although not all the staff members of Renji Charitable Hall are religious believers, they all have the spirit of sacrificing themselves to help others. In this era of soaring prices, the highest salary a staff member can receive is no more than 180 yuan, and the workers only receive 40 or 50 yuan, plus a rice subsidy of 360 yuan. This meager amount is hardly enough to feed themselves, let alone support their families. In addition to the military allowance of 180 yuan per month, the doctors do not receive any other expenses. They have a benevolent heart and practice benevolent skills to save people and help the world. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Oil and Grain Regulation, Production, and Sales, Supplying Raw Materials to Oil Mills, Rationed Oil for Households to be Sold Widely from the 11th</h3>
<p>In order to control and manage edible oil and miscellaneous grains (excluding wheat), and to regulate and circulate production, sales, supply, and demand, and to balance prices and suitable distribution, the Oil and Grain Professional Committee has taken over the control of oil and miscellaneous grains, and has established offices in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui to handle them. It is reported that the soybeans, rapeseed, sesame, peanuts, and cottonseed that have been collected will be handed over to various oil mills to be used for the production of edible oil. The edible oil rationing for households will continue to be handled by the edible oil wholesalers for the time being. The sixth phase of household edible oil distribution will begin on October 11.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Delay in Takahashi Rationed Sugar</h3>
<p>Regarding the implementation of sugar rationing in this city, residents of the Takahashi area have not been able to obtain their rations, and they have repeatedly requested solutions to meet their needs. According to reporter inquiries, the reason for the delay in distributing sugar in that area is that the rationing organization has not been fully established, and lacks someone in charge. Relevant authorities are currently urging progress, and as soon as the rationing organization is established, distribution will be carried out according to households.</p>

<h3>Collected Essays of Toyusuke Yoshida, First Volume Published</h3>
<p>Mr. Toyusuke Yoshida is a typical Japanese scholar who has lived in China for many years. Regarding Chinese issues, he is able to restrain subjective prejudices and emotions, and is even more willing to humbly listen to opinions that contradict his own, especially the opinions of ordinary Chinese people and young people. Therefore, his insight into the current situation and his understanding of the inner workings of the Chinese nation are by no means accidental. Recently, at the request of this newspaper, he wrote articles expressing his thoughts and opinions. The content focuses on the current situation and politics, but also discusses cultural, economic, and social issues, which have been widely welcomed by readers. Recently, the Sino-Japanese Cultural Research Institute, with the aim of promoting Sino-Japanese cultural exchange, requested to compile the first volume of his collected essays, which has already been published. This newspaper is acting as the distributor, and each copy sells for ten yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Having recently read the "On Concurrent Positions" editorial in the October 6th Guanbao, we were very grateful for the insightful comments regarding the concurrent positions held by staff of our association in the Rice Control Association. The Rice Control Association was provisionally established at the beginning of last month. Under the direction of Director Yuan, staff were selected and assigned to concurrently handle the affairs of the Rice Control Association in order to achieve the effect of immediate action. When the Rice Control Association was established, all concurrently held positions in the Chamber of Commerce were terminated. Vacancies are currently being filled in order to achieve comprehensive planning and gradual adjustments. We are sending this letter to seek clarification and to have it published in the "Letters" column to correct any misunderstandings. Shanghai Special Municipal Chamber of Commerce. October 6th.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Newspaper Release Time: 7:40 PM</p>
<p>Brief Commentary: No Concurrent Positions for Rice Control Association Staff</p>
<p>Yesterday's editorial in this newspaper, "On Concurrent Positions," concerned rumors of municipal chamber of commerce staff concurrently holding positions in the newly established Rice and Grain Control Committee. We are dedicated to ensuring the efficiency of both the Rice and Grain Control Committee and the municipal chamber of commerce, urging that individuals resign from one position in order to focus on the other. We are respectfully offering this earnest advice to the authorities of the committee. We have received a letter from the municipal chamber of commerce indicating that staff from the chamber of commerce were temporarily assigned to the Rice Control Association during its preparation, and that upon the association's establishment, these concurrent positions were converted to full-time roles.</p>
<p>From the beginning, we have shown sincere enthusiasm and deep expectation for the Rice and Grain Control Committee. The greater the expectation, the more sincere the sentiment, because rice and grain are so closely and significantly related to the people! In particular, the establishment of the Rice and Grain Control Committee is a response to the urgent demands arising from repeated failures in grain administration in the past. The strict measures and the work of the Rice Control Committee can only succeed and must not fail. Therefore, we must reiterate that establishing a model from the beginning in personnel matters is the basis for the success of the work.</p>
<p>Now, the statement from the municipal chamber of commerce proves that the Rice Control Association authorities have been able to value the arduousness of their tasks, and we are deeply impressed. At the same time, we hope that the association can remain unremitting and accomplish its arduous tasks as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Sports</p>
<h3>Basketball Match: Qianghua Wins</h3>
<p>The second act of the grand basketball match was held yesterday afternoon starting at 3:30 PM at the Paramount Ballroom. Because of the intensity of the initial competitions, the crowd was unprecedented. As a result, the women's team celebrated a resounding victory, avenging their defeat in the previous competition. In the battle between the volunteer team of Huanan and Tongren, Huanan relied on good communication to defeat the "specialist" team of Tongren. In the final act, Qianghua fought against a mixed team. Qianghua went into yesterday's match with a do-or-die mentality. The soldiers of the three armies fought with all their might. Yesterday's performance was full of strategy and tension. The battle situation also became a stalemate at times. However, Qianghua had aspirations for success. Under extremely stressful circumstances, they relied on their final efforts and eventually defeated the mixed team with a score of 42 to 32.</p>
<p>Comments from the Economic Sector</p>
<h3>"Usury"</h3>
<p>Those of us who study the history of economic thought can all talk about the medieval doctrine of usury. In medieval times, the word "usury" often referred to interest, but its broad meaning included any price that was higher than its fair price, or in other words, taking more than what was given. In the Middle Ages, charging interest was considered absolutely illegal. After the rise of cities and a money economy, this idea changed greatly. With the progress of modern industry and the rise of trade, the value of money and the theory of taking profits were further changed. During wartime, these changes became even greater.</p>
<p>In ancient village autonomous systems, people valued fairness, and taking profits was not allowed. In a monetary economy, the act of lending money and profiting from it was often carried out between individuals or groups with no connection. Thus, the practice of "usury" arose. During wartime, because people generally held the idea of "fishing in troubled waters," they could not engage in purely ethical business behavior. They only knew how to value interest, and interest became heavier and heavier. The way to correct this is to use the power of education to shift human thinking, so that they recognize that the decline of social welfare is the decline of individual welfare.</p>
<p>Therefore, under the call to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihood, we advocate restricting merchants' profits. This newspaper's editorial on the issue of loan firms participating in profit distribution believes that "in order to help eliminate hoarding, suppress prices, and fundamentally solve the problem of coping with huge expenditures, it is more appropriate to not participate in profit distribution and endure temporary difficulties." This is the same idea. We have observed that various sectors in Nanshi are requesting to ban pawnshops from increasing interest rates and shortening the pawn period, especially in cases where the pawned item is lost if the pawner accidentally overlooks the expiration date and is not allowed to redeem it. This not only violates legal principles (because after the law establishes a mortgage, the mortgagor can still occupy the mortgaged object and use, benefit from, and dispose of it), but also affects the people's livelihood, because in times of wartime hardship, even middle-class families sometimes have to rely on pawns to maintain their lives. Therefore, "usury" has a significant impact on the welfare of citizens during wartime, so we elaborate on it.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Approved the Commerce Control Association's Permission for Free Trading of Bid Bonds, Prices Also Not Restricted</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: The Executive Yuan's Provisional Regulations on the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth and the Implementation Guidelines stipulate that half of the payment should be converted according to the fixed price of 40,000 yuan per tael (ten liang) of bid bonds. The National Commercial Control Association inquired with the Ministry of Finance, concerned that there had been discussions about nationalizing the bid bonds, and asked whether the bid bonds paid in the future could be freely traded and whether there would be price restrictions. According to a reporter's inquiry with the Commercial Control Association, the Ministry of Finance has formally replied to the association, stating that the nationalization of gold has not been implemented, and cotton merchants who receive bid bonds can freely trade them. There is no restriction on prices, and this can be publicly announced.</p>
<h3>Oil Professional Committee to Establish Offices in Various Production Areas</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency): The Oil and Grain Professional Committee of the Commercial Control Association, considering that various miscellaneous grains such as soybeans, small beans, corn, sorghum, oils, fertilizers, rapeseed, cottonseed, peanuts, and sesame will all be appearing on the market in succession, has made preparations for purchase, distribution, transportation, and sales. Offices will be established in various production areas to facilitate the purchase and transportation work, in order to achieve smooth promotion. It is learned that the office in this capital will be established in the near future.</p>
<h3>Coal Industry Consortium Prohibits Buying and Selling in the Market</h3>
<p>The fuel market has been quite chaotic recently, and coal merchants are hoping to obtain illegal profits. "Black market trading" is on the rise again. Yesterday, it was learned that the Coal Industry Consortium, considering that the market currently only allows business firms in the same industry to make transportation contacts and that any transactions are still prohibited, has issued notices separately, absolutely prohibiting buying and selling in the market. Once detected, they will be expelled from the market or severely punished. At the same time, they earnestly advise colleagues to abide by market regulations and not engage in any improper actions. Otherwise, regardless of whether they are known or unknown, they will not be lenient and will be dealt with according to regulations.</p>
<p>Rationed Coal Is Strictly Prohibited from Resale</p>
<p>It has been investigated that the authorities have long authorized the Coal Federation to be responsible for distributing various types of coal (whether it is anthracite, white coal, fines, or lumps) in this city. However, in order to promote welfare, the "Da Zhong Lian Coal Company" was established, and the lower-level institutions are the United Association of Coal Industry Merchants and the United Association of Coal Retail Merchants. The Da Zhong Lian Coal Company has been in charge of distributing coal rations multiple times. However, these coal rations are only limited to being sold to legitimate users, and colleagues are strictly prohibited from reselling each other for profit, or arbitrarily raising prices, or illegally hiding them. Otherwise, the allocation will be canceled.</p>
<p>Raw Materials for Coal Briquettes Are Currently Still Abundant</p>
<p>A Shanghai News reporter learned yesterday from someone familiar with the coal industry that the city's coal reserves are not much different from two or three months ago. It is mistakenly thought that various textile and dyeing factories are in a state of shutdown. The coal supply will be distributed to legitimate users this month, but the raw materials for coal briquettes (white coal fines) are still abundant. The materials needed by various coal briquette factories are supplied by the relevant authorities on a regular basis. However, the supply of coal briquettes has not only failed to improve recently, but has become difficult to purchase. Everyone feels deeply uneasy and hopes that the authorities will clarify the truth in order to benefit the people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Authorities to Control Egg Prices</h3>
<p>Starting this week, China and Japan will implement unified action on the supply and demand of eggs and implement control. Therefore, the high price of eggs can be reduced. The current increase in egg prices is due to merchants disrupting the control.</p>
<p>Reimplementing Distribution Methods</p>
<p>The current plan to control egg prices is to reimplement the previous Sino-Japanese distribution method and determine a price limit. This price limit is approximately equal to the market price on May 1st. The control plan includes both buyers and sellers, so that the supply and demand of eggs in the Shanghai area can be effectively controlled.</p>
<p>Transportation Requires Permission</p>
<p>In order to investigate and deal with the smuggling of eggs, the controlling authorities will issue egg transportation permits starting next week. Those who do not have this permit will not be allowed to pass. At the same time, in order to prevent black market sales, an appropriate system will be established to manage the sale, purchase, and import of eggs in the Shanghai area.</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese Allocation Method</p>
<p>It has been investigated that the Shanghai Japanese Egg Merchants Association and the Shanghai Egg Merchants Association will implement the following distribution plan for the inventory sold by the Yangzhou Egg Cold Storage Company: In terms of eggs, the Japanese Merchants Association will account for 60% and the Chinese merchants will account for 40%. In terms of duck eggs, the Japanese merchants will account for 40% and the Chinese merchants will account for 60%.</p>
<p>Dynamics of Various Trade Associations</p>
<p>Leather Manufacturing Industry: The Leather Manufacturing Industry Association in this city has detailed statistics on the import and export of leather by colleagues every month, so it has been quite effective in suppressing sales prices. Recently, it has also revised business rules, distributed them to colleagues, and they have been approved by all members, awaiting approval from the competent authorities for implementation.</p>
<p>Chinese Medicine Industry: The Chinese Medicine Industry Association in this city has recently undergone a thorough reorganization to adapt to the new economic system in order to promote business. It has now received Order No. 68 from the Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau, designating Sang Yutang and Dong Boqin as members of the preparatory committee, with Sang Yutang as the director of the preparatory committee. Registration procedures for membership applications will be handled at the association's address at 147 Edward Road, Zhonghui Building, Room 104, from today to the 10th.</p>
<h3>Cotton Professional Department to Form Cotton Inspection Committee</h3>
<p>After the General Commercial Control Association canceled the Cotton Industry Professional Committee and established a Cotton Industry Professional Department to take charge of the control, purchase, and distribution of cotton, the lower-level organizational structure of the department has also been determined. One is the Cotton Industry United Association of Chinese Merchants, and the other is the China-Japan Cotton Industry Association of Japanese Merchants. The task of inspecting the quality of cotton during future cotton collection will be handled by a Cotton Inspection Committee formed by the mutual dispatch of members from China and Japan, six from each side, for a total of twelve people.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>

<h3>Chinese Stock Market Treasure Book to Be Republished, Purchased Eagerly Yesterday</h3>
<p>The "Pocket Chinese Stock Market Treasure Book," the most complete reference book for Chinese stock investors, was published yesterday. It is distributed by the Enterprise Publication Agency at 996 Jing'an Temple Road (Meiqi Building). Customers flocked to purchase it. It is estimated that over 1,000 copies were sold in one day. It is reported that there are not many copies printed, so purchase quickly. In response to the enthusiastic demand from all parties, the agency has decided to prepare for the republication as soon as the first edition is sold out.</p>
<p>Business Summary</p>
<p>Public Bonds: The market for unified public bonds was depressed due to the continued selling of physical bonds. Category C bonds fell sharply, while Categories A, B, and E fell less sharply. Category D bonds traded at the key point. All bonds traded slightly lower than before.</p>
<p>Rice and Grains: Arrivals of rice were plentiful. Retail sales were initially active but then became stagnant. Individual households continued to purchase. Sentiment remained firm. Price fluctuations were limited. Edible oil remained in high demand and short supply. Prices continued to fall gradually.</p>
<p>Northern Goods: Arrivals remained sparse. Sales in this street and inland were sluggish. Gold needles and ears continued to rise. Red and black dates were quietly rising. Almonds remained steady.</p>
<p>Medicinal Materials: There were more sellers. This is largely due to the fact that the industry association has been reorganized and the business has been reformed. Some domestic buyers were deeply afraid of being restricted, and many sold their goods.</p>
<p>Industrial Raw Materials: Trading has been especially slow recently. Because of the implementation of control over yarn and cloth, some factories have stopped production, so the market has become greatly depressed. Currently, except for white wax, which has seen slight activity due to unscheduled retail sales, items such as pigments are still lacking in activity.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities: The market situation is stagnant. Sentiment in all directions is sluggish. Soap and matches are not inquired about. Kerosene candles are still selling well, but because there is a shortage of goods, prices remain steady. The prices of American, British, and new high-end cigarettes are increasing. Miscellaneous brands are also increasing in unison.</p>
<p>Commercial Control Association Control Work</p>
<p>Welcome Instructions and Criticism</p>
<p>Letters Must Include True Name and Address</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the National Commercial Control Association, this association is a commercial autonomous group with the important responsibility of control. In this initial stage of implementation, there are many complex and confusing issues. We look forward to the wise men of society working together to make progress. All matters that this association should promote and reform are extremely welcome to external instructions and criticisms, so as to learn and reform. Since the establishment of this association, there has been no shortage of wise men who have given us advice. We are deeply grateful for their concern. However, recently we have often received reports and letters that do not include a true name or communication address, so there is no way to consult, which is regrettable. We hope that in the future, those who send letters for advice will be sure to include their true name and address so that we can consult. If necessary, we will absolutely keep it confidential.</p>
<h3>General Situation of the Central Reserve Bank's Implementation of Monetary Policy: Notable Success in Commodity Control and Currency Work</h3>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank, in order to curb prices and establish sound financial institutions, has been committed to contracting currency and striving to maintain currency prices since March of this year. Recently, the financial community has achieved a sound foundation, and significant results have been achieved in price and currency work. The commodity control measures have yielded results for the financial community that can be expected. Before this spring, the Central Reserve Bank strived to circulate Central Reserve Bank notes and carry out unified currency work, so that the post-war</p>
<p>National Government economy</p>
<p>achieved a major improvement. At the same time, rising prices not only affected the lives of ordinary people, but also affected wartime economic work. Therefore, it focused on controlling commodities and suppressing currency, and actively implemented measures to restrict loans and recover funds, which were the key points of the currency contraction policy. It also encouraged public savings to absorb idle funds. On March 15, the Central Reserve Bank's Loan Consolidation Regulations were announced. Within two months after March 15, the Central Reserve Bank gradually recovered</p>
<p>Interbank Lending</p>
<p>Without special permission, loans will no longer be granted, and no extensions will be granted after the expiration date. General unsecured loans and collateral loans for daily necessities such as grain, cotton, and yarn were also suspended. If goods were requested as collateral, members of the trade association were required to hold a certificate from the association and a business license issued by the competent authority. As a result, after the implementation of strict economic measures, the general public and financial figures were greatly panicked, and the money market showed an abnormal contraction. In late May, the Central Reserve Bank's fund recovery work came to an end.</p>
<p>Controlled Finance</p>
<p>After the state gradually returned to normal, loans from the Bank of Japan were generally subject to the embassy's oversight, while the Bank of China implemented control autonomously through the Banking Association, in order to assist the Central Reserve Bank's financial control work and promote its smooth implementation. Subsequently, with the cooperation of both the government and the people, currency work became even smoother. The Central Reserve Bank previously issued notes, which were greatly affected by the Japanese abolition of the issuance of military notes. Society's demand for funds was extremely strong, and after reaching an unprecedented high last month, it gradually stagnated. Before long, due to</p>
<p>Issuance of Lottery Tickets</p>
<p>The capital absorption work was further strengthened, and the deposit amounts of the Central Reserve Bank and other banks showed an increasing trend. The financial community returned to a healthy track of development. As a result, the Shanghai price index showed a downward trend. The black market rice price gradually fell from late July, and other general commodities also gradually softened following the rice price. Taking Shanghai as an example, it can be seen that commodity control and currency work have achieved considerable results.</p>
<p>Future Issues</p>
<p>The issue now is how to promote the current currency work rationally, especially how the Cotton and Cotton Yarn Collection of the Commercial Control Association will be used, and whether the Rice and Grain Control Committee's purchase of rice can solve the problem of suppressing prices. We place great hope on this.</p>

<p>Opinions on the Food Problem</p>
<h3>Preliminary Suggestions for Improving the Food Problem</h3>
<p>— Shi Yu</p>
<p>The food problem is the most important issue in the national economy and people's livelihood. Our country has always attached great importance to it since ancient times. In the Great Plan, the first of the eight administrations is food. Confucius also said that in governing, "sufficiency of food" is necessary. The Father of the Nation, Sun Yat-sen, in the Three Principles of the People, also considered "the food problem" to be one of the four major needs of life. Since the outbreak of the China Incident, the food problem has become serious, and the government has even set up a special department to solve the people's food problem. Taking the situation in Shanghai as an example, the implementation of food control has been going on for more than a year. However, the ration of household rice is getting less and less, and the black market price of rice is getting more and more expensive, making the general public feel the pain of not being able to make ends meet. Indeed, the difficulty in managing food administration is a fact. This situation cannot be solely blamed on the food administration organs. However, I'm afraid no one will deny that the food administration has not been handled satisfactorily. There have been precedents in history for malpractices in handling food, and it did not start today. Moreover, no matter how the malpractices change, they are ultimately due to two kinds of reasons: internal reasons and external reasons.</p>
<p>Internal Reasons</p>
<p>The so-called "internal reasons" are the malfeasance of the personnel in charge. Although there are thousands of details, they can be summarized into several types: "reporting cheap as expensive," "reporting expensive as cheap," "reporting more as less," and "reporting less as more." The so-called "reporting cheap as expensive" means that when buying food, using inferior goods and reporting them at a higher price. Although the quantity does not decrease, the difference in price due to the difference in quality is still considerable. As for storage time and transportation time, the practice of "reporting more as less" and "reporting less as more" should be implemented. The so-called "reporting more as less" means that when storing or starting transportation, it is clearly received one million piculs of high-quality rice, but it may be reported as 950,000 piculs received, citing losses. Then, the excess amount is the benefit of the handler. As for the time of release from the warehouse, the superior may designate 800,000 piculs of rice to be dispatched, but only 780,000 piculs may be shipped, and inferior goods may be used. Thus, the two techniques of "reporting cheap as expensive" and "reporting less as more" can be used in combination. As for "reporting expensive as cheap," it can be applied during storage or distribution. For example, it is clearly received high-quality rice, but it may be reported as secondary rice, using the secondary rice to make up for it and selling the high-quality rice. The difference between one in and one out can be called profit. In addition, there are various items such as those mentioned in the Shanghai News Agency's editorial on September 3, and the return of sacks, etc. Therefore, those who handle food and official duties in our country are naturally considered to have poor salaries. Although there are regulations on losses, they are mostly lenient, and there are still many places where people can manipulate things. Those who are not ruthless have considerable income. If they are more ruthless, they can become wealthy in a short time!</p>
<p>External Reasons</p>
<p>In addition to the "internal reasons" mentioned above, there are also "external reasons" why our country's food administration cannot be handled well. "External reasons" can be further divided into "overlapping taxes," "slow transportation," "bandit disturbances," and "imperfect investigation." The so-called "overlapping taxes" is written very thoroughly and clearly in Mr. Zhang Yunbo's "Fair Price of Rice" in the Shanghai News on September 5, so there is no need for the author to talk more. The so-called "slow transportation"... when ships are insufficient, there is indeed a state of cherishing its ability to help. It seems that we should gradually find ways to improve, so that the people of Shanghai can obtain peace of mind. As for "bandit disturbances," because the government's peaceful areas are expanding day by day, bandit areas still exist. These areas not only do not obey government orders, but also cause disturbances. Farmers' rice is often bought by them at low prices, so that it cannot be transported to cities, causing unexpected panic in the future of people's food. Furthermore, due to "imperfect investigation," the area of arable land in each region, the average annual harvest, and how much surplus is available for application in other regions, except to supply the needs of the local people. Moreover, it seems that the government does not have any specific plans for how to adjust the food supply in various places, but only treats the symptoms rather than the root cause. Therefore, there is a phenomenon that the regulated food supply cannot arrive in Shanghai on time (this is based on reports). If there can be a detailed plan and a strict organization, then the food supply in Shanghai should arrive on schedule, and there should be no delays or reductions!</p>
<p>Regarding the food problem in our country, it is better to strive for future improvements than to talk about the malpractices of the past. On the one hand, increase production so that the people of the whole country can be self-sufficient. On the other hand, eliminate corruption so that farmers and rice-eating people can all benefit and not feel pain. In the current environment, it is of course necessary to implement control. Food control can be further divided into the steps of control and the organs of control to seek countermeasures:</p>
<p>Steps to Control Food</p>
<p>Although our country is known as an agricultural country, there are different opinions among scholars as to whether the annual food production is sufficient to meet the needs of the people. Judging from the current situation, it is difficult for anyone to deny that food production should be increased. In addition, reasonable control should be exercised over purchasing, storage, transportation, distribution, etc., so that the current serious state of food can gradually improve. The following is a separate discussion:</p>
<p>Production Control: Regarding China's current food problem, a policy of promoting production should be adopted, divided into the following eight items:</p>
<p>(A) Increase the Yield per Unit Area: If the yield of crops per unit area is to be increased, it is first necessary to examine the productivity of the land. If the productivity of the land has reached the edge of intensive cultivation, then even if capital and labor are increased, the result will inevitably be subject to the law of diminishing returns. The productivity of Chinese land, in terms of the unit area of food crops, is known to be not fully utilized. Professor T.L. Buck calculated the average yield per hectare of major crops in 2,866 farms in 7 provinces and 17 regions in China, and compared them with those of other countries. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Comparison of Average Yields per Hectare of Major Crops in Various Countries (Unit: Quintal)</p>
<p>By examining the above table, it can be seen that there are still many places where the yields of Chinese crops are not as good as those of others. From this, it can be seen that the productivity of Chinese land has not yet been improved. If the rice yield can be increased to the same as Japan's, a yield of 30 quintals per hectare is also equal to 13.5 quintals in Japan. The corn yield per hectare and the area of ​​production in the United States... there are no accurate statistics on the area of ​​wasteland in our country: the area of ​​land reaches more than 1,177.7 million mu, and as for arable wasteland, 1,464 million mu. Furthermore, if wells can be built and ditches can be opened in the Yellow River Basin, and machines can be used in the Yangtze River Basin to build dikes and gates, the area of ​​cultivation will be expanded. If these wastelands are used to sow grains, even if China does not improve production, the annual production of rice and wheat will definitely increase greatly. As for the use of wasteland, the government should set up a special reclamation bureau to be responsible for handling it, which will naturally be very effective.</p>
<p>(C) Improve Rice and Wheat Seeds: Because the seeds of rice and wheat in various parts of our country are mixed, the varieties are inferior, and the harvest is poor. At present, there is considerable recognition in the country of the importance and value of variety improvement. Local government agencies, as well as agricultural schools and agricultural experiment stations, all undertake the work of variety testing, and use scientific methods to improve seeds. According to reports, the rice seeds improved by National Central University can increase production by more than 100% compared with the seeds of farmers that have not been improved. The result of the promotion of the improved rice seed No. 2905 of Jinling University near Nanjing is that it can increase production by 40% compared to the seeds of farmers. According to the results of the wheat improvement experiment of the University, a single-spike variety can increase production by 56.8%, and improved varieties and hybrid breeding can increase production by 98.3% to 105.3%. In addition, the standard yield of rice breeding experiments can be increased by 42% to 77%. It can be said that the seeds of rice and wheat in our country should be improved, which is undoubtedly a well-known fact.</p>
<p>(D) Improve Irrigation and Drainage: In North China, rainfall is scarce during the growing season of crops, especially during the growing season of wheat and other winter crops, and the area irrigated by rivers is also limited, so the yield per mu of crops is very low, and planting is also restricted. Therefore, the construction of irrigation projects and the increase of irrigation water sources are really essential, but the projects are huge and must be handled by the government. Previously, the North China International Famine Relief Commission had advocated well irrigation in various parts of North China. It is said that although the irrigated area is small, the results are very good, and it is easy for farmers to do it, and it can be promoted. As for the Yangtze River Basin, most of the land is low-lying, and the polder fields and lake beaches are idle in winter. Even if crops are planted, the yield is not abundant. The reason is that the land is low and wet, and wheat cannot grow fully. Furthermore, every summer, mountain floods near the Yangtze River often occur, which can easily cause floods, so drainage work is extremely important. Dr. Wiskov once conducted a drainage production experiment in the low-lying fields of Zhejiang. The result was that the yield of drained low-lying fields increased by 30% compared to those that were not drained, so it is also important to promote drainage work.</p>
<p>(E) Prevent and Control Pests and Diseases: Although there are no accurate statistics on the losses caused by pests and diseases to rice and wheat crops in our country, the damage caused by stem borers is common in all regions, which can be called severe. According to the estimates of entomologists in the past, the damage caused by stem borers to the rice grain of the Republic of China averaged 120,000 jin per year. If estimated according to current prices, it is of course even more considerable. In addition, there are rice blast, rice sesame spot, wheat smut, wheat black smut, wheat black... the annual losses are also extremely considerable. There are many ways to prevent and control rice... Methods of manual prevention and control, such as collecting eggs in the fields in spring, destroying roots and stems in winter, or flooding the fields with water. Methods of chemical prevention and control, such as using carbon disulfide, chromic acid, sulfur, etc. to kill pests; using carbonic acid, formalin, copper sulfate, and chromic acid, etc. to control diseases. Scientific prevention and control methods, such as using these or allocating... to create disease-resistant varieties to replace diseased varieties. Recently, European and American countries have adopted the above-mentioned methods to prevent and control the damage of crops, and the promotion has been quite effective. Domestic agricultural universities and agricultural experiment stations are also imitating them, and they should be promoted as soon as possible. If the losses are reduced, it is to increase the production of crops.</p>
<p>(F) Improve Fertilization: The fertility of the soil is most closely related to the yield per mu, so maintaining and improving the fertility of the soil is extremely important for improving crop production. Farmers in our country only know how to stick to old methods and never pay attention to fertilization, so they simply do not understand the issue of improving soil fertility. According to the results of European and American experiments, the application of appropriate fertilizers can increase wheat production by 20% to 50%. According to the results of the Nanjing experiment, if appropriate fertilizers are applied, wheat production can be increased by 15%. In addition, European and American countries use chemical fertilizers to increase production by 15% to 50%, so the quality and quantity of fertilizers should be improved in our country. Fertilization should be sufficient in quantity so that the soil fertility can be properly maintained; and the combination of the three fertilizer elements should be appropriate so that the soil fertility can be improved. In the future, the soil of the whole country should be analyzed as soon as possible, and a national fertilizer experiment should be held, so that the most suitable area for chemical fertilizers can be determined, and natural fertilizers should be improved, and domestic ammonium sulfate and other artificial fertilizers should be developed to resist the invasion of imported products. In addition, the combination of the three fertilizer elements, as well as the improvement of fertilization time and methods, etc., should also be studied in detail before they can be promoted...</p>

<h3>Responding to the Movement to Ban Smoking and Gambling</h3>
<p>— Jing Wan</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw Mr. Gardener's masterpiece in the News, and I was quite moved. Smoking and gambling tools were all burned, which was also refreshing. I absolutely agree and hope that the Citizens' Thrift Association will promote it.</p>
<p>Smoking a few cigarettes and playing eight rounds of mahjong are very common and ordinary things. Most readers think it is very serious. Thinking about it carefully, people really take it too casually and too unimportant! Many people who eat white noodles and sleep in alleys have gradually become like this.</p>
<p>In the social circle, about 99 out of 100 people smoke, and the other one is bound to smoke. Mahjong need not be mentioned. Three-foot children have already woven red middle whiteboards. The harm of being exposed to it is more than this.</p>
<p>Wake up, addicts of smoking and gambling! Do not hesitate, put the smoking and gambling tools at home before the Thrift Association determines specific methods, and first personally ban smoking, not only restrain yourself, but also persuade friends. At least when guests come to the door, offer a cup of tea instead of cigarettes. This is easy to do, so why not do it?</p>
<p>I have always advocated the cloth clothing movement for decades as one day. I hate smoking and gambling even more, but I cannot prohibit the actions of others. The directors of the Thrift Association unanimously suggested that saving time, energy, and economy should first promote the ban on smoking and gambling. Now, burn them by hand to show determination, and I hope those who are interested will also do so.</p>
<p>Samsung Soap Factory's Loan-Sale Method</p>
<p>In order to maintain the livelihood of the common people and support small businesses, Samsung Soap Factory has specifically formulated a loan-sale method so that those without capital can use their lives. The method is as follows: All those who are introduced through Shen Bao and have a shop guarantee of 500 yuan can apply to the factory for goods to be sold on credit. After the factory accepts the guarantee and confirms it, it will lend various soaps worth 500 yuan at the lowest price, to be sold in stalls or by hand, but the proceeds from the sale must be returned to the factory in full every night, and then the sold-out goods will be replenished for sale the next day. If the lender cannot clear the account and pay the money every night, the qualification for lending will be revoked, and the guarantor will be pursued for compensation. If it is impossible to find a guarantor, it is also possible to deposit a considerable amount of credit or cash as a guarantee. As long as the loan is settled, the guarantee can be returned at any time. This method can be consulted at Samsung Soap Factory, No. 17 Xinxin Market, Jing'an Temple Road, corner of Erming Road.</p>
<p>Donation of Malaria Pills</p>
<p>Defeng Charity Association has been donating malaria pills for many years, which are very effective. Whether it is new or old malaria, one dose can cure it completely. Yesterday, 50 doses were donated to this place. If philanthropists from all over the world have the heart to donate, the association can match them at cost. The association is located at No. 1 Yuanshang Lane, Dongzilaihuo Street, 8th District.</p>
<p>Lectures</p>
