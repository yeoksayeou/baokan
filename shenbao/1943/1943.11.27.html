<h3>基本問題</h3>
<p>任何事業必先解決其基本問題而後能發揚光大，本立而道生，乃不易之理。若僅以敷衍目前搪舉門面為能事，或可苟安須臾逞快一時，但終非持久之道，亦且有一旦崩潰之虞。從事於個人工作以及集團事業，當注意及此，而策劃國家大計者，尤不可以其淺近不足道而忽之。</p>
<p>立國之大綱約有下列四端：　培養國民之一斑程度及訓練專鬥技術者曰敎育。　改善民生充實國力者曰經濟。　度支出納控制金融者曰財政。　對內保障治安對外捍禦强暴者曰軍警。此四者固未能包羅一切，然欲中華民族能負起其應負之使命，應先從此若手，務必使之健全穩固而後可。請即就此四項論共各別之基本問題。</p>
<p>敎育：在此對外作戰之際，就一般而言，可稱絃歌未絕，但是叩共實質論其效率，必將使任何人喪胆而失色。故急應解決敎育上之基本問題以圖挽救，其值得檢討之要目有如下列：（甲）國民應有之思想為何？（乙）一般國民應有最低之程度如何？（丙）如何使用最有效之方法而完成甲乙兩項所擬定之目標？（丁）對於中高級敎育之水準如何？（戊）對於敎師及敎材之取捨如何？此五者有明顯之確定，然後能產生合於時代合於需要之有效敎育。　經濟。經濟所含之部門極多，要皆賴積極性的政策加以扶掖而繁榮之。若祗知統制而不知生產，是猶僅能節衣縮食而不知謀生，終必一空如洗而後已，何况統制之實施尙米能盡如人意，前途史堪祀憂，目前急待解決之基本間題如下：（甲）目　各部門在此非常時期必不可少之產量究需若干？（乙）就地可取之原料人力有若干？（丙）仰給於鄰近地區之　注者為數又若干？（丁）由丙項而得交通運輸之最少總量若干？（戊）應有至少之交通工具若干。（己）完成此最低限度之經濟建設需時若干？此數者得有答案，然後能見成效。　財政：收入支出之預算不但需要規定，更需要遵守，決治國之精髓在此。若經常棼亂束支西絀，更甚而剜肉袖　澎漲通貨，是皆飲鴆止渴愚不可及，應急速解決之問題如下：（甲）正當之賦稅資收若干？（乙）取之於民者是否盡用之於民？）丙）敎育建設以及軍警各項支出若干？（丁）因建設而充裕國庫。共為數若干？（戊）倘有不足為數若干？（己）開源節流之計劃何在？此皆基本問題中之最要者，一日不解決，則一日不能穩定。　軍警：軍警之訓練與記合，軍與警軍與軍以及警與警間之權限，於軍警力量之發揮至為重要，故亟需檢討下列諸基本問題：（甲）現有之軍警是否有可裁减合併者？（乙）現有軍醫之缺陷何在？（丙）如何彌補其缺陷而使之健全？（丁）倘人數興配備上需要補充，則其來源如何確定？凡此種種皆應早日求得其答案而後能求整飭。</p>
<p>基本問題之研究最沉悶最繁重，表　上觀察之頗易使人興勞而無功之感，加以各生管人員每存五日京兆之心，其擱置而無人過問者宜矣。以往復受英美侵略政策之章掣，更有欲行不得之苦。今也自大東亞戰爭展開以還，所謂英美之牽掣早經掃蕩無餘，而中日盟約訂定以後，更可得盟邦之協助，一切責任均須吾人看承而無推諉之餘地，自本年十月三十日起，開始吾人自力更生之新途，用敢提出最淺顯之基本問題，以供有心人士之檢討，而期我中華民族為東亞更有力之一員。倘再蹉跎歲月，而不見盟約之效，豈能謂盟約之罪，則罪在吾人！</p>

<h3>美對日挑戰眞相來栖氏發表談話　回憶兩年前在美交涉經過</h3>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　三十年十一月二十六日，為美赫爾國務卿將類似最後趙牒之對日通告手交日野村·來栖兩大使之日，迄今適為兩週年，日來栖大使，於二十五日下午會見記者團，囘想此痛恨之一日，發表談話，說明日·美交涉之眞相·揭穿美國對日挑戰之惡面目。共大意謂，余自日美交涉歸來，於茲巳二年·猶憶二年前之今日，余　野村大使接得美方之覺書時甚感失望。同時。美國交之前途，極為憂慮，翌日與野村大使同訪羅斯福及赫軍，促其反省，　爾對吾之質問，未作何等囘答，僅請美國鑒於今日之事態，唯有貫澈最初之主張，然赫爾於其後彼等發表之羅巴特委員會報告「戰爭與和平」「及公文書美」中亦認以上即交涉之決裂·當時並對沒陸海軍首腦表示交涉中止，翌日判明赫爾曾對美大使通告斯旨，意在迫使日本發動戰爭。余接獲覺書後，所以失望者，　為此乃美方對十一月二十日我方提案之囘答，後我方之提案本極公正，且應允將越南南部之駐兵撤至北部，故當時美國及香港，馬尼刺方面亦盛傳，日美交滲於是月未即可透現曙光，至少亦可成立臨昨協定·華盛頓等地亦有各種傳說，美國務院內隊日本之提案，分爲軟硬兩派，傅曾連日召開會議，協商可否妥協，然　余推斷，當時高唱强硬論者，即為英·美·　所謂（ABCD）十國代方等，似曾舉行會議，中國及荷蘭惟英美之馬首是濟。據赫爾談：中國代　乃於彼等第一次會談終了後，始行參加，又澳洲公使曾對余暴震其本國不安謂，若日美會談如此演變，實屬危險，其後澳洲公使似曾訪晤英大使，謀打開僵局，但為英大使拒絕。自澳洲而言，乃根本反對戰爭，故日美開戰之主動者，可推斷為美國之一部强硬論者，據開戰後所得情報，傳羅斯福於即將入於戰爭狀態之前夕，曾對其側近者謂，如此始能置日本於吾所欲置之地位，日本將不得不對美國發動戰爭。最近，美國民以美國會明確之戰爭目的，故對美政府戰爭指　　極表不滿，而政府當局者則謂，此次戰爭乃日本發動者，勿忘珍珠　事件云云，以上所談，若為美國民判明，即彼等可知現在美國戰爭指　部之如何謬悮矣。十一月乃余永不能忘之一月，本年十一月五日，舉行大東亞會議，發表空前之大東亞宜言，　議席上菲律賓洛勒爾總統及印度臨時政府主席江特拉鮑斯氏均發表動聽之演說，余曾參加各種會議，然此種　　無比之會議，尙屬初見。大東亞會議之眞相及宣言發表後，美政府極力掩飾或加以曲解，蓋該宣言之內容若為美國人知曉，則笑國內必將發生重大問題，故美政府對波根維果島之戰敗及大東亞宣言極少言及。吾等被軟禁後，於翌年正月讀紐約泰晤士報華盛頓支局長柯洛克於該報發表支特赫爾之言論謂，實則赫爾不欲對日方提出如此之　書，本　遷延日。美交涉，以完成美國之準備云云，此或為事實眞相。余認此可證明美國乃欲首先擊潰德國，然後攻擊日本也。</p>
<h3>美實施經濟對鎖爲造成大戰主因　日情報局第三部長談話</h3>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　日情報局新任第三部長井口貞夫，二十六日上午會見外國記者團，就戰前之日·美關係及大東亞戰爭爆發之主因，加以　述謂：「戰前英．美兩團政府所採之政策，實即製造戰爭之典型政策」，而揭發英美　撥戰爭之事實，最後並說明日本之戰爭目的，實在謀求眞正之世界和平。按井口部長戰前曾任日駐美大使館參事官，輔佐野　·來栖兩大使，努力於日·美交涉，所論至為正確，茲誌其要旨如次：帝國爲自存自衛計，迫不得已，乃於前年十二月八日對英美宣戰，實則美國之公然對日挑戰書，前此十餘日，亦即二年　之今日，即已由赫爾手交野村·來栖　大使。目昭和十四年（民國二十八年）七月，美國片面通告廢棄日美通商航海條約以來，美國所取之對日政策，即為恃其優異之經濟資源，實行非法之經濟封鎖，其初，則威嚇日本之對華政策，以援助渝方，後見日本並未屈服其威迫之下，乃復逐次實行禁止石油鐵及其他金屬以及機械等重要物資輸往日本，復於昭和十六年七月，下令凍結日本資產，其歷迫日水可謂無所不用其極。夫經濟封鎖，在承平時代即視為敵性行為，並為戰爭之原因，美國對日經濟封鎖政策，即在其本身視之，巳承艦係藉經濟手段實行戰爭之行為，當時美國所以不用武力而採經濟手段者，不過為基於軍備未完成以前，所探取之對日進攻有利之手段。然當時日本政府力求太平洋成為眞正之和平與安定之領域。企能保全自己，並防止戰爭擴大為世界戰爭起見，故戰前半年餘之日美交涉，即不外基於此種善意與信心而努力，但日本之一切希望與努力，終因美政府之一　好戰意志·而化為泡影。蓋前年今日，美政府於日美舉行第四次正式會議時，曾提出所謂赫爾四原則，共內容為解釋美方主張締結多角互不侵犯條約，日軍全面由中國及越南撤退，否認國民政府及日本退出三國同盟等，吾人既不欲使自己之祖國置於美國之支配下，故對於美國此種無理要求，實無接受之理。美政府為向其國民强幫其軍事失敗，並為對世界掩飾其好戰政策起見，已屢次對日軍襲擊珍珠灣之事·大半歪曲之宣傳，然按之事實－眞正之挑戰者，乃係曾報告書中·對此直認不讓。觀乎開戰前日本必需之資源即資材均甚充足，放美國所施之經濟壓迫·在日本視之·實不靑爲一致命之打擊，我人於檢討開戰之原因時，對此應加以注意，蓋世界恒久和平，若有某一國或敵國壟斷，若支配世界經濟資源，並對他國出以干涉與壓迫之手段，　絕難實現。職是之故·戰前英美兩國政府所採之政策，實為製造戰爭典型之政策，至今日吾人所以確信。此次戰爭吾人必獲最後之勝利者，乃因吾人之目的在求藉此次之試驗與犧牲，匡正　成此次戰爭之不合理狀態，先在東亞建設不許互相侵略與獨佔之共存共榮之國際新秩序，以期貢獻世界之和平與進展也。</p>
<h3>鮑斯氏談中國充滿新生氣象</h3>
<p>昭南二十六臼中央社電　自由印度臨時政府主席江特拉鮑斯，二十六日接見記老國發表談話，略謂余於訪日歸途訪問南京時，深感汪主席確為實現中國國父孫文先生遺　之指導者，同時亦信近代中國之偉大愛國者，今正為中國民衆謀福利而努力·而新中國之前途巳因此次中日同盟條約之締結而充滿無限之光明。蔣介石一派尙未認淸新情勢，仍竊作無　之抗戰·其嚴不可及。尤以派兵至印度以與英美協力，實為印度之敵人，彼若仍執迷不悟，則中國民衆不久將完全離叛蔣介石。今日中國當前之急務，決非聯結英美而在統一國內。如菲島今巳充滿新生氣象，余確階洛勒爾總統係菲律賓之偉大指導者，總之東亞各國應以亞洲全體關係爲念·打成一片爭取最後勝利。</p>
<h3>巴莫在菲時　對記者談話</h3>
<p>馬尼刺二十六日中央社電　緬甸巴莫國家代表赴日出席大東亞會議後，歸途抵此，曾於十九日在莽總統官邸會見菲記者團，發表談話如次，緬，菲兩國於大東亞共榮圈內負有同樣之特別責任，就戰略上言之，菲律賓負有維護亞洲東東部之責任，而緬甸則係東亞西方門戶之守備，且為印度，泰國，馬來，中華民國之後　。蓋以緬甸維護亞洲西方，菲律賓雄據亞洲東南入口，乃同時為東亞門戶之守衛者，故兩國之關係，實為緊密，故緬，菲兩國於此點上又謂其有同生共死之關係。再由經濟方而而言，乃米及本材石油等資源之寳庫，故對於大東亞之自給自足上，當有寞大之　獻，而菲律賓亦擁有豐富之天然資源，故亦可同樣質獻於東亞．其次就印度問題言之，印度問題誠乃東亞各民族所關心之重要問題，前於大東亞會議中，余曾提及此問題，蓋有下列數項理由，在第一，緬甸與印度乃長期以武器對共同敵人鬥爭之同志，故緬人對於與英帝國主義抗爭之印度民衆深具同感。第二，適如前於大東亞會議中所闡明者，即印度如無自由，則亞洲絕難得眞正之自由。又吾人今如不能自英國手中奪出印人之資源，則英帝國主義實難滅亡，此即金所謂印度如無自由，則亞洲不能解放之意也。</p>
<h3>日滿間將開辦模寫電報業務　準備推行至大東亞各地</h3>

<h3>合作事業委會　謀食糧增產</h3>
<p>南京二十六日中央社電　行政院合作事業委員會，為謀我國之農村建設獲得健全發展，故對合作事業積極推進，對地方合作社人員資質提高，尤為注意。此則注重養成合作社之中堅人員，施以各種訓練，務期適合現時代之需要，蓋以往合作社單為物資配給機關，此實為消極工作，今後將協力農村之一切增產工作，以達到合作社之現實使命。為改良消毒種子，確保自配肥料，調整勞働力，謀求社員福利，開發水利等工作，現正由該委員會搜集各有關資料計則，具體方案，擬於明春着手實施，以協力食糧增產政策之推進。故該會今後之工作開展，國人感寄以深切之熱望。</p>

<h3>歐洲防共拾德莫屬　郭培爾發表論文</h3>
<p>柏林甘六日中央社電　擴海通社訊：德宣傳部長郭培爾在德國週報發表一文，討論「今日歐洲之局勢」。據稱，歐人應牢記在心，紅軍使入歐境，祇有德軍為抵抗共產潮梳之中流砥柱，迄今尙有數處人民痴望英美之援助。又稱·歐洲之人對於在一東歐不惜犧牲與蘇軍血戰之德兵，應表示感謝，否則共產主義泛濫之後果，將不堪設想。一年前歐洲人對東歐戰事尙可淡漢視之，而今　出力爲德軍之後盾，不應長此袖手旁觀。郭氏之結論力陳贊助歐洲秩序之國家，必可獲得最後勝利。</p>

<h3>東行觀感　（二）</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>昨記東行觀感，因行裝甫卸，朱暇構思，拉雜成篇，聊以奉獻國人，當作他山之石，攻我之錯。惟尙有數事，可資借鏡，爰不辭煩瑣，再記如次：</p>
<p>遵守時間，在日本也是極普遍的現象。我從上海飛　福岡，歷時三小時，從福岡搭火車往東京，第一日下午七時開車·翌日下午五時到達·絕未延誤一分鐘。</p>
<p>公私機關團體的辦公時間、也極準確，遲到早遲的事，絕少聽到。一般重要機關的職工，更延長工作時間，白天之外，繼之以夜，有宿於機關內者。這稱事實，在公家立塲，為適應戰時需要，要求人民使用最大的精力：而在人民立塲，為報稱國家，願意又獻最大之輸力，責任心之昂揚，職守之重視，實無異於第二生命。這一種官民一片，爲共同目標而努力的國家，怎樣值得我們　野的注視與警覺啊！</p>
<p>東京市範團·有人口八百萬、較之我們上海的人口更多。可是，東京街道上的行人，却很稀寥，因為人人都有職業，各有工作，紹少逛馬路，閒　踛者·除非在上H或下值的一定時間內，才多行人走動。這裏也可以看出日本有閑階級之少見，生產工作之緊張。</p>
<p>戰時交通，因家事上之優先使用，民用交通工具，即感缺乏，是為通例，日本自亦不能例外。日本鐵路車站，旅衆也須列隊出入，但秩序良好，進出迅捷。雖官階頗高者，亦滲入平民旅衆依次列隊，更無目前上海北站，化了錢即可先排的情形。電車等公共車輛，上下車時常看到軍官推護老百姓先行。</p>
<p>日本頗注重「鍊成」二字，一切事情，都根據此二字之精神應付，用「鍊成」的精神以彌補物質環境之不足。「鍊成」就是類似我們所說的「鍛煉」「訓練」，不過，我們所說的鍛練訓練，計劃多於實行的。而他們則買　多於計劃的。響如日本各級學校對於體育一項，極端注重。尤其是淸少年體格的「鍊成」，絕不紋鬆，雖嚴寒凜冽。經常課體作野外運動。經此「鍊成」的靑少年之體格，無疑的强壯健碩。此次南太平洋玻根維爾島之大捷，得力於海軍航空部隊，而此輩航空部隊隊員，就是久經「鍊成」的靑少年航空兵。所以，勝利之獲得，絕非僥律與偶致的。</p>
<p>日本政府對於中國留學生，擬採用嚴格管理方法，雖巳計議，尙朱實行。我曾數度與日本長間領袖　談，希望從速實行嚴格管理。我認為中國和平區內人才缺乏，尤以技術人才為甚。因此，往日本留學者，際以理H科者為限，同時，絕對應與日本本國學生同樣管理，同樣「練成」。其他如文科法科以及經濟科等學生，不必往日本留學。而由日本大學如慶應早稻田等校，在中國各大都市設立分校，聘請中國資望深厚者擔任校長，敎授由日本派來，嚴格訓練學生。因目前日本大學靑年入伍服兵役，學校與敎授比較淸閑，適可利用機會來華設校。我們如果放遠目光觀察，中日問題之澈底解決，中日之間的眞正親警，在五年十年以後始可趨入正軌，此時不過努力於　基工作，所以，培養人才應於此時趕快辦理。我曾將此種意見向日本人士表示，因補記於此，希望爾國朝野促其實現。</p>
<p>東京市內奢侈品，如眞珠翡翠等高貴飾物，雖有店舖發售，但專供外國人購賢，日本人絕對不准購買，也不見日本人　用，此雖瑣事，而從此窺知人民節　之一斑。</p>
<p>綜括一辭，此行觀感，日本之所以有今日的强盛地位者，是從脚踏實地，說到做到，官民一致，埋頭苦幹中得來，決不是僥倖與偶然的。我們中國當然也希望臻於强盛地位，這是每個人民所不會否認的，那末，如何可以達成，日本的一切就是一個最適近最現實的榜樣，我們口頭上說仿傚還是不夠的，一定也要脚踏實地，說到做到才行，任重道遠，願國人亟起圖之！</p>

<h3>評言　憑票購買制</h3>
<p>戶口油配給事宜，決予改善，過去之憑戶口證領油，即將予以廢止，改為憑票授給制，與計口授米，麵粉，糖，火柴，肥皂相同了。</p>
<p>在蘇聯之統制經濟中，憑票購買始於第一次五年計盡中所採用之計畫配給制，如當時列靑格勒城中所實行的麵包憑票購買，即其一例，後來因為第二次五年計畫成功，國內生產多於消費，因而撤消憑票購買制。迨德蘇開戰以後，蘇聯又實行憑票購買制了，並且廣範圍的普及於全國；一切生活必需品如麵包黃治等，無不憑票購買，且其價格雖在開戰二年有餘的今日，仍與戰前無甚參差，（昨日本報「東行觀感」一文中，亦稱日本國內物價，近二年來日常用品均採配給制度，物償並無變化。）蘇聯在憑票購買制以外，並非沒有自由市塲，其一切不急需的物品，固完全集中於自由市塲，而商品價格，固亦貴得驚人，可是，蘇聯的大衆生活，絕不受其影響，因爲他們在國營市塲能夠憑票買到政府所規定的一切生活必需品，而且蘇聯政府所認為重要一部份之國民，如勞工，軍人及其家族，主要官應職員，都有特別配給，質量豐富，價格低廉；其在自由市塲購買者，不過是被認爲不必要之一部分國民而已。</p>
<p>由於上述一節，我們感覺不行憑票配給制則巳，否則必須備具以下幾個條件：　一切生活必需品概須憑票購買，　配給必需普及於全民衆，　價格必須特別低於自由市塲，　質量不容任意減削，　憑票必須可以如期，並且如數購到生活必須品，猶如銀行期票，不簽則已，否則必須使持票人到期能夠如數領得款項，期毋失期票之信用。</p>
<h3>檢查金融事務處　取締遠期本票　下月起禁止行莊開發</h3>

<h3>松島報道部長談　太平洋戰況　美無稽宣傅掩蔽事實</h3>
<p>中央社訊　日在滬陸海外聯合報道常會，昨下午三時循例假南京路外灘　中五樓畢行，招待本市中國新聞記者團，艦隊報道部長松島大佐偕同鹽田大尉出席外，日本大使館，上海事務所，到廣田情報課長，福間副領事等，即席由松島部長發表太平洋戰　！最後由廣田部長解答記者團提出之各項問題　詳。</p>
<p>日在滬陸海外三當局主持之定例聯合報這常會，特於下月起變更接見本市中國新聞記者團，今後聯合定例會見·規定每月首週之星期五舉行，此外則由陸海外三常局單獨個別舉行·下週五　值變更之首次定例會見之期，仍假匯中五樓舉行。</p>
<p>發表戰況</p>
<p>艦隊報道部長松島大佐，發表太平洋戰况，首謂：關於所羅門島方面，自反輸心海軍失收後，艦隊行動較為寂靜，日空軍則不斷加以攻擊。據美發言人所稱巴爾維亞島上陸之美最優秀部隊，在三千至四千左右，經日空軍加以攻擊後，按船中斷，接濟發生恐慌，美航空司令部為企圖挽救所羅門方而之領勢，其原因實由於巴爾維亞島之美所損失戰艦及兵力不在所島之下，故我人根據美方所發表之消息，不難於地圖中一素便得，乃一極小之島嶼，而美方究予以誇大宣傳，且以一師團之兵力，發動攻勢，尤共將所遭受之慘重損害，盡量予以掩蔽，詭稱損失微小。</p>
<p>無稽談話</p>
<p>而美太平洋司令長官尼米茲，於二十四日接見新聞記者發表談話，尤為無稽之尤，謂美艦隊在所島未發現日軍，並謂攻巴爾維亞島為擊日軍之心賊據點，及美機在太平洋數量頗少，於此我人可予以證明美之掩蔽事實。蓋自所羅門島開始作戰後，美機較日機為多，今其自認空軍不足，顯以暴露損害龐大，同時並發表積極製造航空母艦，窺共用意，乃欲蓋彌彰，以補充所受損失之躁急。再據所謂美攻擊巴島時，未載現日軍一點，更毫無根據。</p>
<p>戰略關係</p>
<p>按在決戰時，莫不均在本身有利據點作　　攻擊、是乃戰略上之關繫！我人既知自北部千島至日本土及南洋羣島，以至外南洋及新佔領區城所有之防禦，早巳完成準備，凡英美敵軍愈進此防禦綫，則予我人戰鬥愈有利，而反軸心之損害更大，此即內經作戰，並且日全部H業之努力發揮製造精良之飛機戰艦，源源運赴戰綫，而戰艦之建造特別有利地形，故今後一旦使用即可能獲得更大之戰果，將來並可影響於印度洋地中海大西洋等處之作戰有利。</p>

<h3>北京通訊　黃膽病流行</h3>
<p>北京今年是病年，夏未秋初的虎列拉巳經鬧得不亦樂乎，現在又流行黃阻病。這黃胆病正在蔓延，街頭巷尾到處可以碰到面如黃紙的病夫，親戚朋友間也常有患此病者。我的朋友某君家裏輸有兩個患黃胆病的人。不過因為這病是慢性的病，不若虎列拉那樣的劇烈，一般市民和當局都不大注意。然而慢性病的危機却不在急性病之下，我們的朱委員長不是把生命交給黃胆病神嗎？可是虎列拉有眞性和偽性之別，黃胆病也有眞假之分。年來在飢餓綫上的人不都是　帶菜色嗎？這些餓鬼實在都是假性黃胆病的患者。戌列拉雖較黃胆病為烈，但假性虎列拉學竟容易療治，獨有假性黃胆病却是最難醫治的。</p>
<p>秋深賞菊</p>
<p>以往是每年秋天總有許多賞菊大會，而中央公園的菊展也是特別惹人注意的。今年雖然是戰時，然而一般人也並沒有忘却賞菊的雅事。這幾天公園的遊客就特別多，而實業總署的園藝試騐塲也決定於本月四日起學行賞菊花展覽會。試騐塲的塲長殷一新氏，且於三日下午三時招待報道新聞界賞菊。由此亦可見得中國人的逸散天性了。</p>
<p>一張名書</p>
<p>近日報載中央公園水樹展覽，王維山氏所作的名畫萬虎圖。據說王氏是畫虎專家，有十餘年的努力·這張萬虎圖是三年來畫夜不息所繪出來的偉大作品，是一幅長卷，長十丈，所繪的虎千百成羣，姿態各異，風景不同，此外同時展覽的還有王氏畫虎立軸五十件，都是畫虎，一一精采。</p>

<h3>「樑上君子」昨晚獻演</h3>
<p>演巴黎門前車水馬龍全塲觀衆笑聲不絕</p>
<p>苦幹劇團為木報讀者助學金作長期義演，第一個劃目「　」巳經圓滿地閉幕了。第二劇目「樑上君子」，也於昨天晚場在巴黎大戲院隆重獻演。昨晚還不到八點開幕的時候，巳經宜告上下客滿，證明了苦幹劇團號召力的堅强，也證明了社脅人士對於助學運動贊助的熱烈！</p>
<p>滿院笑聲</p>
<p>佐臨先生導演喜劇手法，早巳膾炙人口，而「樣上君子」又是一部世界聞名的鬧劇。在劇中出現的人物，如律師，小偷，交際花，女學生，女敎師，警官……等等，莫不出之以婉　的　　，笑料之豐富，趣味之濃郁，都是一個新的紀錄，而第二幕中小偷假　律師，律飾反成囚徒，錯盡錯絕，尤其令人捧服、昨奏獻演的兩小時半中·滿院的笑聲，始終未曾停止。</p>
<p>演技竸賽</p>
<p>苦幹劇團演員　術的優秀，是為觀衆所深知的。史源和王駭，原是話劇壇上著名的丑角；石揮的反派角色，也可說是一時無兩；丹尼是留英專攻演技的，所以有多方面的發揮·而飾演交際花一類的蛇型女性，自「天羅地精」以來，也令觀衆不作第二人態；加之以林榛的痴吧；林彬的嬌　；企洛的態勁，白　的　樣，一舉一動，都好像是催笑彈，令觀衆不這應付。他如英梧·陳平·田黎·莊嚴·樂遙，也都勝任偷快。</p>
<p>佈量的　皇，色彩結構，都極引人入勝，在台上搭出兩層樓的建築，而不覺得侷促，尤為難能可貴。</p>
<p>這是一部成就極高的鬧劇，笑料多而不失其內　的意義，因而易收雅俗共賞之效。</p>

        <h1>1943.11.27</h1>
<h3>Basic Problems</h3>
<p>Any undertaking must first resolve its fundamental problems before it can flourish and become grand. Establishing the foundation is essential for the development of the way, an immutable principle. If one merely focuses on superficially managing the present and putting on a facade, one might achieve temporary peace and fleeting pleasure. However, this is not a sustainable approach and carries the risk of eventual collapse. Whether engaging in personal work or group endeavors, one should pay attention to this, especially those planning national strategies, who should not overlook such seemingly minor matters.</p>
<p>The fundamental principles of nation-building roughly encompass the following four areas: Cultivating the general level of the people and training specialized technical personnel is called education. Improving the people's livelihood and strengthening national power is called economics. Managing expenditures and revenues, and controlling finance is called finance. Protecting internal security and defending against external aggression is called military and police. These four areas may not encompass everything, but if the Chinese nation is to shoulder its due mission, it should start here, ensuring they are sound and robust. Please discuss the specific fundamental problems of each of these four areas.</p>
<p>Education: During this time of war, generally speaking, we can say that learning has not ceased. However, if we examine its essence and consider its effectiveness, it would dismay and shock anyone. Therefore, there is an urgent need to address the fundamental problems of education in order to remedy the situation. The key areas worth examining are as follows: (A) What should be the ideology of the people? (B) What should be the minimum level of general knowledge for the people? (C) How can we use the most effective methods to achieve the goals set in (A) and (B)? (D) What should be the standard of secondary and higher education? (E) How should we select teachers and teaching materials? Clear definitions of these five aspects are necessary to produce effective education that meets the needs of the times. Economics: The economic sector encompasses many areas, all of which depend on proactive policies to foster prosperity. If one only knows how to control without knowing how to produce, it is like only knowing how to economize on food and clothing without knowing how to make a living, eventually leading to utter destitution. Moreover, the implementation of controls is not entirely satisfactory, and the future remains worrisome. The fundamental problems that urgently need to be resolved are as follows: (A) What are the essential production volumes of each sector during this extraordinary period? (B) What are the locally available raw materials and human resources? (C) What is the amount of resources reliant on neighboring regions? (D) Based on (C), what is the minimum total amount of transportation required? (E) What is the minimum number of transportation vehicles needed? (F) How long will it take to complete this minimum economic construction? Answering these questions is essential to achieving tangible results. Finance: Budgets for income and expenditure not only need to be established but also need to be adhered to, as this is the essence of governing a country. Constantly running into disorder, being stretched thin everywhere, and even resorting to selling off assets to temporarily inflate the currency, are all foolish acts like drinking poison to quench thirst. The problems that need to be solved quickly are as follows: (A) What is the amount of legitimate tax revenue? (B) Is what is taken from the people entirely used for the people's benefit? (C) How much expenditure is allocated to education, construction, and the military and police? (D) How much will the national treasury be enriched through construction? (E) If there is a shortfall, how much will it be? (F) What are the plans for increasing revenue and reducing expenditure? These are the most critical of the fundamental problems. Without solving them, stability cannot be achieved. Military and Police: The training and coordination of the military and police, the powers and responsibilities between the military and the police, between different military units, and between different police forces, are crucial to the effective deployment of military and police forces. Therefore, it is urgent to examine the following fundamental problems: (A) Are there any existing military or police units that can be reduced or merged? (B) What are the shortcomings of the existing military medical services? (C) How can these shortcomings be addressed and the services improved? (D) If there is a need to supplement personnel and equipment, how can the sources be determined? Answers to all these questions must be sought as soon as possible to achieve rectification.</p>
<p>The study of fundamental problems is the most tedious and burdensome. On the surface, it can easily lead to a sense of labor without achievement. Moreover, personnel in charge often have a short-term perspective, making it understandable that these problems are shelved and ignored. In the past, we were constrained by the interventionist policies of Britain and the United States, suffering the pain of wanting to act but being unable to. Now, since the start of the Greater East Asia War, the so-called constraints of Britain and the United States have long been swept away. Furthermore, after the signing of the Sino-Japanese alliance, we can obtain assistance from allied nations. All responsibilities must be shouldered by ourselves without any room for excuses. From October 30th of this year, we begin a new path of self-reliance. I dare to propose the most basic fundamental problems for the consideration of interested individuals, with the hope that our Chinese nation can become a more powerful member of East Asia. If we continue to waste time and fail to see the effectiveness of the alliance, we cannot blame the alliance; the fault lies with us!</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Air Force Attacks Enemy Base on Mono Island; One US Navy General Killed in Action</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese military base in the South Pacific, Japanese naval air squadrons bombed enemy positions on Mono Island on the night of the 23rd, inflicting significant damage. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to a broadcast by the New Golden Mountain Radio Station on the 25th, reinforcements for the anti-Axis forces near Finschhafen are quite difficult to deliver. The terrain in that area is particularly unsuitable for the transportation of artillery and other heavy weapons. This is due to Japanese surprise attacks and tropical diseases. The British military representative inspecting military affairs in that area has also expressed similar opinions.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Pearl Harbor, the US Pacific Fleet Command announced that US Navy Colonel Conley was killed in action during the landing operation on the Gilbert Islands on the 20th.</p>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Attacking Taiwan Suffered a Head-On Blow</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - The Kaohsiung Guard Office announced at 4:30 PM on the 26th that around 20 enemy aircraft attacked Hsinchu, Taiwan on the afternoon of November 25th. Our naval air squadrons immediately intercepted them, shooting down three enemy aircraft (two of which have not yet been confirmed). Our losses were minimal.</p>
<h3>Japanese Expeditionary Force in China Releases Weekly Battle Report; Active Air Operations Throughout the Region</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Expeditionary Force in China released a weekly battle report on the 26th as follows: The Japanese army operating west of Dongting Lake is continuing its advance, successively capturing key points such as Jinshi and Lixian, and breaking through the Lishui defense line. Subsequently, on the 18th, it occupied Cili, the base of the 74th Army of the Chongqing government, and repeatedly defeated the enemy forces, capturing Taoyuan on the 21st and continuing to encircle and attack the Chongqing army. Another Japanese unit suddenly attacked Longyang, east of Changde, and completely occupied it by the evening of the 20th, and is currently mopping up the fleeing Chongqing troops. The Japanese army has quickly occupied the positions around Changde and has now occupied Longyang and other places, forming an encirclement of Changde. Its fall is only a matter of time. This action has a significant impact on the Chongqing side, both materially and spiritually. On the one hand, with close cooperation between the Japanese air force and the National Government forces, anti-communist operations have been launched in various locations since the 18th of this month, yielding great results. In North China, the Lu Bei suppression operation has begun, with the aim of eradicating the communist forces of the Qinghe Military District entrenched in the old Yellow River and Xiaoji River areas. In South China, the Japanese army is operating west of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and has already occupied Daling, the base of the Chongqing army, on the 19th, and is continuing to expand its gains. In addition to assisting Japanese ground operations, the Japanese air force has also inflicted heavy damage on the joint US-Chongqing air force, crushing their counterattack attempts. On the 21st, a combined formation of fighter and bomber aircraft launched a surprise attack on Enshi, shooting down eight US-Chongqing aircraft. On the 22nd, it launched a fierce bombing raid on 20,000 Chongqing troops attempting to relieve Changde in Ningxiang (5 kilometers west of Changsha). On the 23rd and 24th, it attacked Changde and its vicinity, achieving significant results.</p>
<p>Japanese Forces Complete New Encirclement Net West of Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 26th (Central News Agency) - Although the Japanese army's mopping-up operation against communist bandits in the western area of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway has concluded, in order to thoroughly eliminate these bandits, a new encirclement net was formed on the 23rd against the remnants entrenched in the Dashian area, 20 kilometers northwest of Mutou. In addition, another main force of the Japanese army echoed this action, and at noon on the 23rd, advanced again to the Mengdi area, northwest of Daling. The bandits who were moving in that area have been suppressed due to the Japanese army's mopping-up operation.</p>
<p>Taiyuan, 26th (Central News Agency) - On the morning of the 25th, the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on about 400 soldiers of the 17th Regiment of the 3rd Column of the Communist Army in the Jin-Sui Military Region in Yangzihui, 10 kilometers north of Linxian County, Shanxi Province, achieving the following results: 70 communist soldiers killed and 32 captured. The Japanese army seized 2 light machine guns, 29 rifles, 2 grenade launchers, and a large amount of other military equipment.</p>
<h3>Military Affairs Reporting Office of the Military Commission Merged into the Political Department</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - The Military Affairs Reporting Office of the General Affairs Department of the Military Commission, since its establishment, has handled military reporting matters with notable success.

<p>Manila, 26th (Central News Agency) - Philippine President Laurel received a delegation of journalists at his official residence at 5:00 PM on the 25th and expressed his impressions of the results of the Greater East Asia Conference as follows: The Greater East Asia Conference is the greatest event in the history of Greater East Asia. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is a sacred text for the prosperity of all nations in Greater East Asia and can also be called a sacred text for all mankind. We should devote all our efforts to promote its realization and ensure that future generations continue their efforts. Now that the conference has achieved such great results, it should continue to be convened in the future to strengthen the power of Greater East Asia. The war currently being waged by Japan is a just war, a war for liberation, and will surely be victorious. My greatest task is to train new citizens with moral integrity and honesty, and to cultivate in them a spirit of sacrificing for the country and for Greater East Asia. At the same time, in the political sphere, it is necessary to promote nationalism. It should be particularly noted that only if the countries of Greater East Asia are firmly united can the Philippines exist and prosper. We sincerely pray for the early completion of the great mission of Chairman Chandra Bose of India.</p>

<h3>Truth About US Challenge to Japan - Mr. Kurusu Issues Statement Recalling Negotiations in the United States Two Years Ago</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - Today, November 26th, marks the second anniversary of the day when US Secretary of State Hull handed a note to Japanese Ambassadors Nomura and Kurusu that was similar to a final ultimatum to Japan. Japanese Ambassador Kurusu met with a group of reporters on the afternoon of the 25th, recalled this day of deep regret, and issued a statement explaining the truth about the Japanese-US negotiations and exposing the evil face of the US challenge to Japan. The main points were as follows: I have returned from the Japanese-US negotiations for two years now. I still remember how disappointed Ambassador Nomura and I were to receive the US memorandum two years ago today. At the same time, I was extremely concerned about the future of US relations. The next day, Ambassador Nomura and I visited Roosevelt and Hull to urge them to reconsider, but Hull did not answer my questions. He only asked the United States to adhere to its initial demands in light of the current situation. However, Hull also admitted in his later Robert Committee report on "War and Peace" and "US Documents" that the above was the breakdown of the negotiations. At that time, he also informed the heads of the Army and Navy that the negotiations had been suspended. The next day, it became clear that Hull had notified the US Ambassador of this, intending to force Japan to launch a war. The reason why I was disappointed after receiving the memorandum was that it was the US response to our proposal of November 20th. Our proposal was extremely fair and promised to withdraw troops stationed in southern Vietnam to the north. Therefore, it was widely rumored in the United States, Hong Kong, and Manila that a glimmer of hope could be seen in the Japanese-US negotiations by the end of the month, and at least a temporary agreement could be reached. There were also various rumors in Washington and other places. The US State Department was divided into hardline and softline factions regarding the Japanese proposal, and it was said that meetings were held for days to discuss whether a compromise was possible. However, I infer that the strong proponents of the hardline position at that time were the so-called (ABCD) ten-nation representatives of Britain, the United States, etc., who seemed to have held meetings. China and the Netherlands followed the lead of Britain and the United States. According to Hull, the Chinese representative only joined after their first meeting was over. Also, the Australian Minister expressed his anxiety to me, saying that if the Japanese-US talks continued like this, it would be dangerous. Later, the Australian Minister seemed to have visited the British Ambassador to try to break the deadlock, but he was rejected by the British Ambassador. From Australia's point of view, it was fundamentally opposed to war. Therefore, it can be inferred that the initiator of the Japanese-US war was a hardline faction in the United States. According to information obtained after the outbreak of the war, it is said that Roosevelt said to his aides on the eve of entering a state of war that this was the only way to put Japan where he wanted it, and Japan would have no choice but to launch a war against the United States. Recently, American citizens have been dissatisfied with the US government's war directives because they are unclear about the US's war aims, while government officials say that this war was launched by Japan and not to forget the Pearl Harbor incident, etc. If the above were made clear to the American people, they would know how erroneous the US war directives are now. November is a month I will never forget. On November 5th of this year, the Greater East Asia Conference was held, and the unprecedented Greater East Asia Declaration was issued. On the podium, Philippine President Laurel and President Chandra Bose of the Provisional Government of India both gave moving speeches. I have attended various conferences, but this was my first time seeing such an unparalleled conference. After the truth about the Greater East Asia Conference and the declaration were announced, the US government tried its best to cover it up or distort it, because if the contents of the declaration were known to the American people, a major problem would arise in the country. Therefore, the US government has said very little about the defeat in the Bougainville Island battle and the Greater East Asia Declaration. After we were placed under house arrest, I read an article in the New York Times the following January by the Washington branch chief Crock, who supported Hull's remarks, saying that Hull actually did not want to present such a memorandum to the Japanese side and had been delaying the Japanese-US negotiations to complete the US preparations. This may be the truth. I believe this proves that the United States wanted to defeat Germany first and then attack Japan.</p>
<h3>US Implementation of Economic Blockade Was Main Cause of the Great War - Interview with Director of Japanese Information Bureau</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - The newly appointed Director of the Third Department of the Japanese Information Bureau, Sadao Iguchi, met with a group of foreign reporters on the morning of the 26th to discuss the pre-war Japanese-US relations and the main cause of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. He stated that "the policies adopted by the British and American governments before the war were a typical example of policies that create war," exposing the fact that Britain and the United States instigated the war. Finally, he explained that the purpose of Japan's war was to seek true world peace. Director Iguchi was previously a counselor at the Japanese Embassy in the United States, assisting Ambassadors Nomura and Kurusu in their efforts in the Japanese-US negotiations. His analysis is very accurate. The main points are recorded as follows: For the sake of self-preservation and self-defense, the Empire was forced to declare war on Britain and the United States on December 8th two years ago. In fact, the United States' open challenge to Japan was issued more than ten days earlier, that is, two years ago today, when Hull handed it to Ambassadors Nomura and Kurusu. Since the United States unilaterally announced the abrogation of the Japanese-US Treaty of Commerce and Navigation in July of the 14th year of Showa (1939), the US's policy towards Japan has been to rely on its superior economic resources to implement an illegal economic blockade. At first, it threatened Japan's policy towards China to assist the Chongqing side. Later, seeing that Japan did not succumb to its coercion, it gradually implemented a ban on the export of important materials such as oil, iron, other metals, and machinery to Japan. In July of the 16th year of Showa, it ordered the freezing of Japanese assets, exhausting all possible means to put pressure on Japan. Economic blockade is considered an act of hostility in peacetime and is a cause of war. The US economic blockade policy towards Japan, even from its own point of view, was an act of war by economic means. The reason why the United States did not use force but adopted economic means at that time was simply because it was a means favorable to the US offensive against Japan before its military preparations were completed. However, the Japanese government at that time sought to make the Pacific a truly peaceful and stable region. In order to preserve itself and prevent the expansion of the war into a world war, the Japanese-US negotiations in the half-year or so before the war were based on this goodwill and confidence. However, all of Japan's hopes and efforts were shattered by the US government's warmongering. Two years ago today, the US government, at the fourth official meeting between Japan and the US, put forward the so-called Hull Four Principles. The contents were to interpret the US's claim to conclude a multilateral non-aggression treaty, the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops from China and Vietnam, the denial of the National Government, and Japan's withdrawal from the Tripartite Pact, etc. We did not want to place our homeland under the control of the United States, so we had no reason to accept these unreasonable demands from the United States. In order to cover up its military failures to its own people and to conceal its warmongering policies from the world, the US has repeatedly distorted the publicity about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, but in fact, the true challenger is the report in which the US directly admits its unwillingness to compromise. Considering that Japan had sufficient necessary resources and materials before the war, the economic pressure imposed by the United States was not a fatal blow from Japan's point of view. When we examine the causes of the outbreak of the war, we should pay attention to this, because lasting world peace can never be achieved if one country or enemy monopolizes or controls the world's economic resources and uses means of interference and oppression against other countries. Therefore, we are now convinced that the policies adopted by the British and American governments before the war were typical policies for creating war. The reason why we are convinced that we will win the final victory in this war is that our purpose is to correct the irrational state that led to this war through this experiment and sacrifice. First, we will build a new international order of coexistence and co-prosperity in East Asia that does not allow mutual aggression and monopoly, in order to contribute to world peace and progress.</p>

<h3>東行觀感　（二）</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>昨記東行觀感，因行裝甫卸，朱暇構思，拉雜成篇，聊以奉獻國人，當作他山之石，攻我之錯。惟尙有數事，可資借鏡，爰不辭煩瑣，再記如次：</p>
<p>遵守時間，在日本也是極普遍的現象。我從上海飛往福岡，歷時三小時，從福岡搭火車往東京，第一日下午七時開車·翌日下午五時到達·絕未延誤一分鐘。</p>
<p>公私機關團體的辦公時間、也極準確，遲到早退的事，絕少聽到。一般重要機關的職工，更延長工作時間，白天之外，繼之以夜，有宿於機關內者。這稱事實，在公家立塲，為適應戰時需要，要求人民使用最大的精力：而在人民立塲，為報稱國家，願意又獻最大之輸力，責任心之昂揚，職守之重視，實無異於第二生命。這一種官民一片，爲共同目標而努力的國家，怎樣值得我們　野的注視與警覺啊！</p>
<p>東京市範團·有人口八百萬、較之我們上海的人口更多。可是，東京街道上的行人，却很稀寥，因為人人都有職業，各有工作，紹少逛馬路，閒　踛者·除非在上H或下值的一定時間內，才多行人走動。這裏也可以看出日本有閑階級之少見，生產工作之緊張。</p>
<p>戰時交通，因家事上之優先使用，民用交通工具，即感缺乏，是為通例，日本自亦不能例外。日本鐵路車站，旅衆也須列隊出入，但秩序良好，進出迅捷。雖官階頗高者，亦滲入平民旅衆依次列隊，更無目前上海北站，化了錢即可先排的情形。電車等公共車輛，上下車時常看到軍官推護老百姓先行。</p>
<p>日本頗注重「鍊成」二字，一切事情，都根據此二字之精神應付，用「鍊成」的精神以彌補物質環境之不足。「鍊成」就是類似我們所說的「鍛煉」「訓練」，不過，我們所說的鍛練訓練，計劃多於實行的。而他們則實行多於計劃的。響如日本各級學校對於體育一項，極端注重。尤其是淸少年體格的「鍊成」，絕不紋鬆，雖嚴寒凜冽。經常課體作野外運動。經此「鍊成」的靑少年之體格，無疑的强壯健碩。此次南太平洋玻根維爾島之大捷，得力於海軍航空部隊，而此輩航空部隊隊員，就是久經「鍊成」的靑少年航空兵。所以，勝利之獲得，絕非僥律與偶致的。</p>
<p>日本政府對於中國留學生，擬採用嚴格管理方法，雖巳計議，尙朱實行。我曾數度與日本長間領袖懇談，希望從速實行嚴格管理。我認為中國和平區內人才缺乏，尤以技術人才為甚。因此，往日本留學者，際以理H科者為限，同時，絕對應與日本本國學生同樣管理，同樣「練成」。其他如文科法科以及經濟科等學生，不必往日本留學。而由日本大學如慶應早稻田等校，在中國各大都市設立分校，聘請中國資望深厚者擔任校長，敎授由日本派來，嚴格訓練學生。因目前日本大學靑年入伍服兵役，學校與敎授比較淸閑，適可利用機會來華設校。我們如果放遠目光觀察，中日問題之澈底解決，中日之間的眞正親警，在五年十年以後始可趨入正軌，此時不過努力於　基工作，所以，培養人才應於此時趕快辦理。我曾將此種意見向日本人士表示，因補記於此，希望爾國朝野促其實現。</p>
<p>東京市內奢侈品，如眞珠翡翠等高貴飾物，雖有店舖發售，但專供外國人購賢，日本人絕對不准購買，也不見日本人　用，此雖瑣事，而從此窺知人民節約之一斑。</p>
<p>綜括一辭，此行觀感，日本之所以有今日的强盛地位者，是從脚踏實地，說到做到，官民一致，埋頭苦幹中得來，決不是僥倖與偶然的。我們中國當然也希望臻於强盛地位，這是每個人民所不會否認的，那末，如何可以達成，日本的一切就是一個最適近最現實的榜樣，我們口頭上說仿傚還是不夠的，一定也要脚踏實地，說到做到才行，任重道遠，願國人亟起圖之！</p>

<h3>Baos Talks About New Vitality in China</h3>
<p>Zhaonan, 26th - Central News Agency - Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, received reporters on the 26th and made a speech, roughly saying that during his visit to Nanjing on his way back from Japan, he deeply felt that Chairman Wang was indeed the leader in realizing the teachings of Mr. Sun Wen, the Father of China. At the same time, he also believed that he was a great patriot of modern China, who is now working hard for the welfare of the Chinese people. The future of the new China is full of unlimited light due to the conclusion of this Sino-Japanese alliance treaty. The Chiang Kai-shek faction has not yet recognized the new situation and is still foolishly carrying out a meaningless war of resistance. In particular, sending troops to India to cooperate with Britain and the United States is actually an enemy of India. If they are still obsessed, the Chinese people will soon completely abandon Chiang Kai-shek. The urgent task for China today is definitely not to unite with Britain and the United States, but to unify the country. Just like the Philippines is now full of new vitality, I firmly believe that President Laurel is a great leader of the Philippines. In short, all East Asian countries should consider the overall relationship of Asia and work together to strive for the final victory.</p>
<h3>Ba Maw's Remarks to Reporters in the Philippines</h3>
<p>Manila, 26th - Central News Agency - The Burmese National Representative Ba Maw, after attending the Greater East Asia Conference in Japan, stopped here on his way back. He met with a group of Philippine reporters at President Roxas's residence on the 19th and made the following remarks: Burma and the Philippines have the same special responsibilities within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Strategically speaking, the Philippines has the responsibility of maintaining Southeast Asia, while Burma is the guard of the western gateway of East Asia and the shield for India, Thailand, Malaya, and the Republic of China. Because Burma defends the west of Asia, and the Philippines dominates the southeast entrance of Asia, they are both guards of the East Asian gateway. Therefore, the relationship between the two countries is very close, and the two countries have a relationship of shared life and death on this point. Economically speaking, it is a treasure trove of resources such as rice, timber, and oil. Therefore, it should make a great contribution to the self-sufficiency of Greater East Asia, and the Philippines also has abundant natural resources, so it can also make the same contribution to East Asia. Secondly, regarding the Indian issue, the Indian issue is indeed an important issue of concern to all East Asian nations. I mentioned this issue at the Greater East Asia Conference before, for the following reasons: Firstly, Burma and India are comrades who have long fought against a common enemy with weapons, so the Burmese people deeply sympathize with the Indian people who are fighting against British imperialism. Secondly, as explained at the Greater East Asia Conference earlier, Asia can hardly achieve true freedom without India's freedom. Moreover, if we cannot seize the resources of the Indian people from the hands of Britain now, British imperialism will be difficult to destroy. This is the meaning of what Mr. Kim said: "Asia cannot be liberated without India's freedom."</p>
<h3>Facsimile Telegraph Service to be Launched Between Japan and Manchuria, to be Extended to Greater East Asia</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th - Central News Agency - The Japan Communications Institute previously consulted with the Manchuria Telephone and Telegraph Company to prepare for the operation of facsimile telegraph services between Tokyo and Xinjing. It has now been decided to start the service on December 1st. The characteristic of facsimile telegraphy is that the text and simple diagrams written by the sender on the telegraph paper can be transmitted electrically in their original form, unlike the necessary phenomena of phototelegraphy, and the procedures are also simpler. The realization of this communication method opens a new era in the history of Japanese electrical communications. If this type of telegram can be popularized, the existing Katakana telegrams will be replaced by Chinese character telegrams. Especially in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, where national languages ​​differ, telecommunications will have epoch-making progress as a result. The implementation of this type of telegram is truly worth looking forward to. Currently, it is only limited to Japan and Manchuria, and it is planned to be implemented in Zhaonan within this year.</p>
<h3>Cooperation Business Committee Seeks to Increase Food Production</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 26th - Central News Agency - The Cooperation Business Committee of the Executive Yuan is actively promoting cooperative business to achieve sound development of rural construction in our country, and is paying particular attention to improving the quality of local cooperative personnel. This focuses on training the backbone personnel of cooperative societies, providing them with various trainings, and striving to meet the needs of the present era. In the past, cooperative societies were merely material distribution agencies, which was actually passive work. In the future, they will cooperate with all production increase work in rural areas to achieve the practical mission of cooperative societies. The committee is currently collecting relevant data and plans for improving and disinfecting seeds, ensuring self-supplied fertilizers, adjusting labor force, seeking welfare for members, and developing water conservancy, and plans to start implementing concrete plans in the coming spring to assist in promoting the food production increase policy. Therefore, the people of the country have deep hopes for the future development of the association's work.</p>
<h3>Tobacco Merchants in Suzhou Donate Money to Purchase Aircraft</h3>
<p>Suzhou, 26th - Central News Agency - The Central China Tobacco Allocation Association and the Sino-Japanese tobacco merchants in Suzhou, in order to respond to the mission of the decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War, have collected and preserved all the tinfoil from the allocated tobacco from the first to the fourth phases. Recently, they sold these tinfoils and donated the resulting sum of more than 600,000 yuan to the Japanese military authorities to purchase an aircraft, which is scheduled to be officially donated on the 8th of next month.</p>

<h3>US Near East Director Arrives in Ankara for Activities</h3>

<h3>Italy Revises its National Title and Emblem, Renamed "Italian Social Republic"</h3>
<p>Rome, 26th - Central News Agency - The Italian Cabinet decided yesterday, during a cabinet meeting held by Chairman Mussolini, that the official name of Italy would be "Italian Social Republic."

<h3>German Troops in Italy Hold Fast to the North Bank of San Gullo</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 26th - Central News Agency - According to a Huitong News Agency dispatch from Algiers, anti-Axis war correspondents reported yesterday afternoon that German troops in San Gullo, southern Italy, were putting up strong resistance. The German troops are holding the north bank of the river, and their rearguard on the south bank is also putting up strong resistance to the vanguard of the British Eighth Army. Due to the bad weather and the icy cold river water, the British army has not dared to attempt to cross the river.</p>
<h3>Post-War Economic Plans of the Anti-Axis Countries</h3>
<p>According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Pyongyang on the 26th: As part of the United States' plan to consolidate world finance after the war, a "United Nations Construction Bank" will be established to provide long-term reconstruction loans. The bank's shares will be shared by various countries. It is reported that the United States will subscribe for £87.7 million, Britain £25 million, and the amount to be subscribed by the Soviet Union has not yet been determined, but it should be less than Britain.</p>
<h3>Goebbels Publishes an Article: Germany Deserves to Defend Europe from Communism</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th - Central News Agency - Expanded Huitong News Agency report: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels published an article in the German weekly, discussing "The Situation in Europe Today." It is said that Europeans should keep in mind that only the German army is the mainstay in resisting the communist tide when the Red Army enters Europe, and there are still some people in several places who foolishly hope for assistance from Britain and the United States. It also stated that the people of Europe should express their gratitude to the German soldiers who are sacrificing themselves and fighting the Soviet army in Eastern Europe at all costs; otherwise, the consequences of the rampant spread of communism would be unimaginable. A year ago, Europeans could take a indifferent view of the war in Eastern Europe, but now they should contribute to the support of the German army and should not continue to stand by and watch. Goebbels concluded by strongly advocating that countries that support the European order will surely achieve final victory.</p>
<h3>The Great War Between the German and Soviet Armies on the Dnieper Bend Front is the Fiercest in Two Years</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th - Central News Agency - According to German military authorities, the Soviet army has already broken through the German defense line south of Kryvyi Rih, and fierce fighting is now underway between the two sides.</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th - Central News Agency - According to Huitong News Agency, the intensity of the fighting on the Eastern Front in the past 24 hours has not eased at all. The ferocity of the offensive and counter-offensive by the two armies is the most intense in the past two years. The German army in Korosten is attacking to the south and southeast. The German army west of the Dnieper River is counter-attacking, exerting pressure by attacking eastward from Zhytomyr and northward from Fastov. However, due to the wet ground, the Soviet army is resisting stubbornly, and progress is slow. The Soviet army attacking from the Cherkasy bridgehead continues to advance, but it retreats without success due to the effective combat of the general army. The enemy army in the Dnieper Bend has reinforcements arriving, increasing its strength. The German army immediately counter-attacked, cut off the enemy's rear troops, and annihilated them.</p>

<h3>Japanese Embassy in China Restructures Again; Section Chief Hirota Answers Questions from Press Corps</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: The Japanese Embassy in China has once again restructured its organization, including the Shanghai Office. Chief Hirota of the Agricultural Information Section answered questions from the press corps at the Overseas Press Regular Meeting yesterday afternoon. The Nanjing Embassy in China will now have two main departments: General Affairs and Information. The original Cultural Department will be merged into the General Affairs Department, and the original Economic Department will be abolished and placed under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Office. The Shanghai Office previously oversaw the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions. Now it also includes economic affairs for Wuhan and the central China area along the Yangtze River. The original structure of the Shanghai Office has also changed, with the merger of the General Affairs Department and the Deliberation Room to form a General Affairs Office. Its authority encompasses all embassy affairs. This restructuring emphasizes the General Affairs Office and aims to streamline the embassy's tasks. In addition, the Reporting Section has been renamed the Reporting Team. The original organization and personnel remain unchanged, but their duties have been expanded. The Information Department of the Nanjing Embassy itself has also been expanded.</p>

<h3>New United Hosts Ningbo Press Delegation</h3>

In addition to officials from various newspapers in the city attending, the association has specially invited officials from relevant Japanese, domestic, and foreign authorities in the city to attend and provide guidance.</p>
<p>Economic Affairs</p>
<h3>Commentary: Ticket Purchase System</h3>
<p>The allocation of rationed cooking oil will be improved. The previous system of using household registration certificates to obtain oil will be abolished and replaced with a ticket system, similar to the rationing of rice, flour, sugar, matches, and soap.</p>
<p>In the Soviet Union's planned economy, ticket purchases began with the planned allocation system adopted in the First Five-Year Plan. An example of this was the ticket purchase of bread in Leningrad at that time. Later, due to the success of the Second Five-Year Plan, domestic production exceeded consumption, and the ticket purchase system was abolished. After the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, the Soviet Union implemented the ticket purchase system again, and it was widely popularized throughout the country. All necessities such as bread and butter were purchased with tickets, and their prices, even more than two years after the start of the war, were not much different from those before the war. (Yesterday's "Impressions of a Trip East" in this newspaper also stated that in Japan, the prices of daily necessities have not changed much in the past two years because they are subject to a rationing system.) Outside of the ticket purchase system, the Soviet Union also has free markets. All non-essential items are completely concentrated in the free markets, and the prices of goods are of course shockingly high. However, the lives of the Soviet masses are not affected by this, because they can buy all the necessities stipulated by the government in state-owned markets with tickets. Moreover, those whom the Soviet government considers an important part of the population, such as workers, soldiers and their families, and key government officials, all have special rations that are rich in quality and low in price. Only a portion of the population deemed unnecessary purchases in the free market.</p>
<p>Based on the above, we feel that if we do not implement a ticket rationing system, then fine. Otherwise, the following conditions must be met: All necessities must be purchased with tickets; rationing must be universal to the entire population; prices must be significantly lower than in the free market; quality must not be arbitrarily reduced; and tickets must guarantee that necessities can be purchased on time and in full. It's like a bank note: if it's not signed, then fine. Otherwise, the holder must be able to receive the full amount when it's due, so that the credibility of the note isn't lost.</p>
<h3>Financial Inspection Office: Bans Future-Dated Promissory Notes; Prohibition of Issuance by Money Houses Starts Next Month</h3>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank's Financial Inspection Office noted that the issuance of future-dated promissory notes by silver and money houses was originally intended to meet customer demands and facilitate cash payments and convenience in carrying money, using the promissory notes instead of cash. However, given the recent trend of small banks and money houses in the city that specialize in issuing promissory notes for the allocation of funds, the office has discovered many malpractices that have greatly affected the entire financial system. In order to protect the funds of merchants and maintain financial stability, the office has specially formulated measures to ban future-dated promissory notes issued by financial institutions. Starting December 1st, all financial institutions (including banks, money houses, and trust companies) are prohibited from issuing future-dated promissory notes. All future-dated promissory notes issued before December 1st must be cleared within ten days. Violators will be severely punished. The measures to ban future-dated promissory notes are as follows:</p>
<p>Prohibition Measures</p>
<p>Measures to ban future-dated promissory notes issued by financial institutions: All financial institutions should stop the issuance and acceptance of future-dated promissory notes from December 1st. If financial institutions need to borrow funds from fellow businesses, or other unavoidable reasons necessitate the issuance of future-dated promissory notes, they should create a format for the promissory note, include the conditions stipulated in Article 117 of Chapter 3 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, and submit the amount, content, and reasons for issuance to the Financial Inspection Office of the Bank for record. Future-dated promissory notes issued before December 1st must be cleared within ten days from the date of implementation of these measures. The Financial Inspection Office may inspect the content of promissory notes issued by financial institutions and related books at any time. Violators of the above regulations may be severely punished by the Ministry of Finance at the request of the Office. (Note: Article 117 of Chapter 3 of the Negotiable Instruments Law states that a promissory note should include the following items, signed by the issuer: 1. A statement that it is a promissory note; 2. A fixed amount of money; 3. The name or business name of the payee; 4. An unconditional undertaking to pay; 5. The place and date of issuance; 6. The place of payment; 7. The due date.</p>
<h3>Chief Matsushima of the Reporting Department Discusses Pacific War Situation: American Absurd Propaganda Obscures Facts</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: The regular joint reporting meeting of Japanese, domestic, and foreign authorities in Shanghai was held yesterday at 3:00 PM at the Huizhong Hotel on the Bund. Chief Matsushima of the Fleet Reporting Department and Lieutenant Shiota attended, as well as Chief Hirota of the Information Section and Deputy Consul Fukuma from the Japanese Embassy and the Shanghai Office. Chief Matsushima delivered a report on the Pacific War situation! Finally, Chief Hirota answered various questions raised by the press corps in detail.</p>
<p>The regular joint reporting meetings hosted by the three Japanese, domestic, and foreign authorities in Shanghai will be changed to receiving the press corps in the city starting next month. The joint regular meetings will now be held on the first Friday of each month. In addition, the three regular bureaus will hold individual meetings separately. Next Friday will be the date for the first regular meeting after the change, which will still be held at the Huizhong Hotel.</p>
<p>Report on the War Situation</p>
<p>Chief Matsushima of the Fleet Reporting Department, in his report on the Pacific War situation, first stated: Regarding the Solomon Islands area, since the naval setbacks in the counter-transportation, the fleet's actions have been relatively quiet, but the Japanese Air Force has continued to attack. According to the American spokesperson, the best American forces landed on Baravia Island, numbering around 3,000 to 4,000. After being attacked by the Japanese Air Force, ship transport was interrupted, and the resupply faced panic. The reason the American Air Command attempted to save the situation in the Solomon Islands was that the American warships and forces lost on Baravia Island were no less than those on the Solomon Islands. According to the news released by the American side, it is not difficult to find on a map that it is a very small island, but the American side has exaggerated the propaganda and launched an offensive with a division of troops, and has tried its best to cover up the heavy losses suffered, falsely claiming that the losses were minimal.</p>
<p>Absurd Talk</p>
<p>The talk given by US Pacific Commander Nimitz to the press corps on the 24th was even more absurd. He said that the US fleet did not find any Japanese troops on the Solomon Islands, and that the attack on Baravia Island was to strike the "heart nest" of the Japanese troops. Furthermore, the number of American planes in the Pacific was quite small. Here, we can prove that the US is obscuring the facts. Since the start of the war in the Solomon Islands, there have been more American planes than Japanese planes. Now that they admit that their air force is insufficient, it is clear that they are exposing huge losses. At the same time, they have announced the active manufacture of aircraft carriers, and their intention is to cover up their eagerness to replenish the losses they have suffered. Furthermore, the claim that no Japanese troops were found when the US attacked Baravia Island is even more unfounded.</p>
<p>Strategic Relationship</p>
<p>In a decisive battle, everyone attacks from a stronghold that is beneficial to themselves. This is a matter of strategic relationship! We know that all defenses from the northern Kuril Islands to the Japanese mainland and the South Sea Islands, and even to the outer South Seas and the newly occupied areas, have long been completed. The more the British and American enemy troops advance into this defense line, the more beneficial the battle will be for us, and the greater the losses for the anti-axis. This is internal line operations, and the efforts of all Japanese industries are devoted to manufacturing sophisticated aircraft and warships, which are continuously transported to the front lines. The construction of warships is particularly beneficial to the terrain, so once they are used in the future, they may achieve even greater results, which will also have a favorable impact on operations in the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic.</p>
<h3>Securities and Exchange Control Committee Selects Office Location: List of Committee Members Already Announced</h3>

<h3>Beijing Correspondence: Epidemic of Jaundice</h3>
<p>This year is a year of illness in Beijing. The cholera that started in late summer and early autumn has already caused quite a stir, and now there is an epidemic of jaundice. This jaundice is spreading, and you can find sick people with yellow faces everywhere on the streets and alleys, and relatives and friends often suffer from this disease. My friend, Mr. So-and-so, has two people in his family suffering from jaundice. However, because this disease is chronic, it is not as severe as cholera, so the general public and the authorities do not pay much attention to it. However, the crisis of chronic diseases is no less than that of acute diseases. Wasn't our Chairman Zhu's life given to the jaundice disease god? However, cholera has true and false distinctions, and jaundice also has true and false distinctions. Aren't all the people living on the starvation line in recent years exhibiting a greenish hue? These starving ghosts are actually patients with pseudo-jaundice. Although cholera is more severe than jaundice, pseudo-cholera is actually easier to treat. Only pseudo-jaundice is the most difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Autumn Deepening, Chrysanthemum Viewing</p>
<p>In the past, there were always many chrysanthemum viewing parties every autumn, and the chrysanthemum exhibition in Central Park was particularly eye-catching. Although this year is wartime, the general public has not forgotten the elegant pastime of chrysanthemum viewing. There have been particularly many visitors to the park in the past few days, and the Horticultural Experiment Field of the General Administration of Industry has also decided to hold a chrysanthemum exhibition starting on the 4th of this month. The field director of the experiment field, Mr. Yin Yixin, also invited the news media to view the chrysanthemums at 3:00 PM on the 3rd. From this, we can also see the leisurely nature of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>A Famous Painting</p>
<p>Recently, it was reported that the Central Park is exhibiting Mr. Wang Weishan's famous painting "Ten Thousand Tigers." It is said that Mr. Wang is a tiger painting expert and has been working hard for more than ten years. This "Ten Thousand Tigers" painting is a great work created day and night for three years. It is a long scroll, ten zhang long, depicting hundreds and thousands of tigers in different poses and with different landscapes. In addition, there are also fifty hanging scrolls of tiger paintings by Mr. Wang on display at the same time, all of which are painted with tigers and are all wonderful.</p>
<p>The Demise of Intellectuals</p>
<p>Recently, the cost of living has been expensive, and the first to be affected are intellectuals. Some time ago, the newspaper reported that a famous scholar who had been a county magistrate and a university professor died on the street due to financial straits. The newspapers these past two days have also been extensively reporting the news of the Zheng Yimei family teetering on the brink of death. Zheng Yimei is a native of the old capital and a drama critic expert, and is now nearly seventy years old. As a result, the newspaper has specially published a fundraising notice for him. However, only ten yuan and one jiao were received on the 11th of this month, and twenty yuan were received on the 12th. This mere thirty yuan is not enough to feed the family of four for two or three days. In this day and age, intellectuals are not only worthless, but even when they are suffering from poverty and illness, they may not be able to receive much sympathy from the general charitable public.

<h3>"Gentleman on the Beam" Performed Last Night</h3>
<p>The traffic in front of the Paris Theater was bustling, and the audience laughed throughout the show.</p>
<p>The Kugan Theater Company is holding a long-term charity performance for the Student Aid Fund for this newspaper's readers. The first program, "[Omitted]", has already concluded successfully. The second program, "Gentleman on the Beam," was also grandly performed at the Paris Theater last night. Last night, even before the opening at 8:00 PM, it was announced that both the upper and lower levels were sold out, proving the strong appeal of the Kugan Theater Company and also proving the enthusiastic support of the community for the student aid movement!</p>
<p>A Theater Full of Laughter</p>
<p>Mr. Zuo Lin's comedic directing style has long been well-known, and "Gentleman on the Beam" is a world-famous farce. The characters that appear in the play, such as lawyers, thieves, socialites, female students, female teachers, police officers... all use tactful [omission], and the abundance of jokes and the intensity of the humor are a new record. In the second act, the thief pretends to be a lawyer, and the lawyer becomes a prisoner, with mistakes compounded upon mistakes, which is especially laughable. During the two and a half hours of last night's performance, the laughter in the theater never stopped.</p>
<p>Acting Competition</p>
<p>The excellent acting skills of the actors of the Kugan Theater Company are well-known to the audience. Shi Yuan and Wang Haike are famous clowns on the spoken drama stage. Shi Hui's villainous roles can also be said to be unparalleled. Danny specializes in acting and trained in England, so he has multi-faceted performances. Since "Heaven and Earth Spirit," he has played serpentine women such as socialites, making the audience think of no one else. Added to this are Lin Zhen's silliness, Lin Bin's coquettishness, Qi Luo's forceful attitude, and Bai Yan's appearance. Every move is like a laughter bomb, making the audience unable to cope. Others, such as Ying Wu, Chen Ping, Tian Li, Zhuang Yan, and Le Yao, were also well-suited to their roles.</p>
<p>The set design is luxurious, and the color structure is extremely attractive. A two-story building is built on the stage without feeling cramped, which is especially commendable.</p>
<p>This is a very successful farce, with many jokes that do not lose their inner meaning, so it is easy to achieve a popular appeal.</p>

<h3>Hoping Enthusiastic People Can Establish Economical Barber Shops</h3>
<p>Recently, barber shops have been raising prices repeatedly, citing the expensive costs of cosmetics such as Vaseline and electricity. As a result, those of us who do not use hair dryers or pomade have become innocent victims, forced to bear the price increases. This is nothing to wealthy friends, but for salary earners with large families like us, we have to spend almost twice as much on haircuts as before. This is another invisible oppression. Therefore, we hope that people with a general enthusiasm for public welfare can establish economical barber shops to serve the community. The price of each haircut should be as low as possible to reduce the burden on the general public. The internal equipment should be as simple as possible. Other unnecessary luxuries, such as hair dryers, pomade, and perfume, are not needed, so as to comply with the principle of frugality. (Ken Zhen)</p>
<h3>Hidden Poverty Appeals</h3>
<p>Seeking Housing: I am a suffering youth. My family is poor and my parents are old. My family of seven depends on me alone for a living. Sadly, my current monthly salary is only 500 yuan. After deducting food expenses, there are no funds left to spare. My pitiful wife and children are in dire need of food, and I am anxious day and night, urgently awaiting the merciful hand of righteous heroes and enthusiastic philanthropists to quickly find a solution and provide a small room to rent at an extremely low rent, so that we can survive. We would be especially grateful if wealthy merchants would show compassion to the impoverished scholars and provide generous support. Zhu Qiusheng. (Correspondence address: Social Services Department of Shen Bao)</p>
<p>Seeking Clothing: With the income of a family teacher, I want to maintain the livelihood of a family of ten. Even drinking congee every day cannot last for half a month. My home is bare, with nothing of value. My parents are alive, and my children are numerous. The clothes I wear are all patched and tattered. When the north wind blows, I shiver and cannot move. If any person of high ideals sees their pity and bestows cotton clothing, then the kindness will be like a new life. (Yuan Zhongshui)</p>
<p>Also, Mr. Xie Guanliu, a graduate of Guanghua University, is suffering from illness and teaching at a public school. His income is very low, and he cannot take care of his children properly. He has no warm clothes. Please, kind people, quickly donate cotton clothing to this office.</p>
<p>Seeking Employment: I am from Wuxi, Jiangsu. I am 37 years old. I used to work in printing and typesetting. I recently lost my job. Today, I have borrowed a bicycle from a friend, and I intend to use it to find a job as a messenger, long-term or temporary, and I can provide a guarantor. Yang Shi Shang. Correspondence address: No. 6, Lane 335, Datong Road (Avenue Road).</p>
<h3>Report on Donations of Winter Clothing</h3>
<p>Ju Wang donated 1,000 yuan, Tian Ji 500 yuan, Tong Ji 500 yuan, Lian Hanren 200 yuan, Mr. Zhou 100 yuan, Feng Feng 100 yuan, Xu Songtai 20 yuan, totaling 2,420 yuan. With the previous balance, the total collected is 37,210.50 yuan.</p>
<p>Key to be Claimed: Fan Zao found a bunch of keys with six keys of varying sizes near the electric tram stop at the Bowling Alley. The loser is requested to come to this office to claim them.</p>
<p>Acknowledgement: Yesterday, we received two donated long robes from an anonymous person. Thank you very much.</p>
